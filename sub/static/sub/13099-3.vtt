00:02.500 --> 00:04.917
[dramatic music]

00:10.833 --> 00:12.917
[machine beeping]

00:15.542 --> 00:16.917
(Stephen)
Breathe in, please.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.625
[inhales]

00:19.708 --> 00:21.625
Again, slowly.

00:21.708 --> 00:23.792
[breathes deeply]

00:29.500 --> 00:32.292
- Does it hurt when I do that?
- No. No, it's fine.

00:32.375 --> 00:35.958
I don't, don't feel a thing.

00:36.042 --> 00:38.000
Ow! Hey, hey, hey.

00:38.083 --> 00:41.083
I don't like it
when my patients lie to me.

00:41.167 --> 00:43.375
(Michael)
'Yeah, but we could've
discussed it. I mean, geez.'

00:43.458 --> 00:44.750
What do you when a patient's
late' with a bill

00:44.833 --> 00:45.792
stick needles in their eyes?

00:45.875 --> 00:47.208
I cannot fill out an honest

00:47.292 --> 00:49.375
physical evaluation
without your cooperation.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.333
You are being cranky
and difficult.

00:51.417 --> 00:52.792
Well, you try getting shot
in the back sometime

00:52.875 --> 00:55.750
and see what it does
for your disposition.

00:55.833 --> 00:56.917
So..

00:57.000 --> 00:58.625
[groans]
...how's it look?

00:58.708 --> 01:01.500
Allowing for your tendency not
to report everything that hurts

01:01.583 --> 01:04.958
your condition seems to be
improving right on schedule.

01:05.042 --> 01:06.625
I imagine you'll be
able to get back to work

01:06.708 --> 01:07.958
in the next day or so..

01:08.042 --> 01:09.958
...providing you don't
exert yourself.

01:10.042 --> 01:12.583
Yeah, well, I gotta check in
with the new captain first

01:12.667 --> 01:14.708
find out if
he even wants me around.

01:14.792 --> 01:17.292
Besides, I don't
know about this guy.

01:17.375 --> 01:19.292
I keep thinking about how
everybody and his brother

01:19.375 --> 01:20.792
wanted Sinclair out of here.

01:20.875 --> 01:23.792
And now all of a sudden
this change of command.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.208
Sinclair I could trust.

01:26.292 --> 01:27.875
This guy...I don't know.

01:27.958 --> 01:31.125
You don't mind my saying so,
you didn't exactly sound excited

01:31.208 --> 01:32.792
when I mentioned
going back to work.

01:32.875 --> 01:36.917
- 'Thought you'd be pleased.'
- Yeah, I-I am.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.625
Mostly.

01:38.708 --> 01:41.708
- See you around.
- Hey, Michael.

01:41.792 --> 01:43.833
Wanna talk about it?

01:43.917 --> 01:46.375
Doc, what do you want me to say?

01:46.458 --> 01:48.667
I got shot in the back
by my own guy.

01:48.750 --> 01:50.458
My own second-in-command.

01:50.542 --> 01:52.542
He was right there all the time,
a snake in the garden

01:52.625 --> 01:54.125
and I didn't even see it.

01:54.208 --> 01:55.917
What the hell kind of a security
chief am I supposed to be

01:56.000 --> 01:57.500
if I can't see
somethin' like that?

01:57.583 --> 01:59.042
You can't be expected
to know everything.

01:59.125 --> 02:01.083
Yes, I can, I could've known

02:01.167 --> 02:03.000
and I should've known.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.208
And now I...I just don't know

02:05.292 --> 02:07.708
if I'm any damn use
to anybody anymore.

02:07.792 --> 02:09.792
You know, I keep asking myself
what qualifies me

02:09.875 --> 02:12.833
to take back my job and..

02:12.917 --> 02:15.708
...I haven't got an answer.

02:15.792 --> 02:18.833
I wish the hell I did.

02:18.917 --> 02:21.708
[intense music]

02:21.792 --> 02:25.917
So we quietly set up monitoring
stations

02:26.000 --> 02:28.083
near Quadrant 37

02:28.167 --> 02:31.208
to keep an eye
on the Narn buildup.

02:31.292 --> 02:32.875
When we heard that you would, uh

02:32.958 --> 02:36.500
personally take care
of the problem, well..

02:36.583 --> 02:38.542
Yes, I'm sure it sounded
quite absurd.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.708
More like insane.

02:40.792 --> 02:43.250
Then the monitors went silent.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.167
Spy probes sent in later
confirmed

02:45.250 --> 02:49.417
that the entire Narn outpost
had been wiped out.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.917
I would be very interested
to know

02:51.000 --> 02:54.333
how you did that, ambassador.

02:54.417 --> 02:57.750
Yes, I'm sure that you would.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.583
[laughs]

03:05.500 --> 03:07.083
Very well.

03:07.167 --> 03:09.625
Keep your secrets for now.

03:09.708 --> 03:12.042
What matters is,
that you have saved

03:12.125 --> 03:15.208
'our people from another
embarrassing surrender'

03:15.292 --> 03:18.042
'by our idiot emperor.'

03:18.125 --> 03:21.208
What you did required
independence of thought.

03:21.292 --> 03:23.833
Initiative. Courage.

03:23.917 --> 03:27.708
And a rather large
and aggressive strike force

03:27.792 --> 03:29.750
which you have managed
to assemble

03:29.833 --> 03:31.625
without anyone knowing about it.

03:31.708 --> 03:34.208
Even the Narns
don't suspect it was us.

03:34.292 --> 03:38.458
Or more precisely, you.

03:38.542 --> 03:41.208
'We need more people
like you, Mollari.'

03:41.292 --> 03:42.917
For what?

03:45.125 --> 03:47.833
He can be trusted.

03:47.917 --> 03:50.625
The emperor...is old

03:50.708 --> 03:52.292
sick and frightened.

03:52.375 --> 03:55.583
'He's a pitiful figure.
His health is failing rapidly.'

03:55.667 --> 03:56.958
'With the recent death
of his son'

03:57.042 --> 03:58.833
'there's no clear line
of succession.'

03:58.917 --> 04:00.625
When the time comes

04:00.708 --> 04:05.125
my associates and I
intend to fill that vacuum.

04:05.208 --> 04:06.667
It will not be easy.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.583
There will be resistance
from the old guard.

04:09.667 --> 04:13.417
Overcoming that resistance
may require force.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.667
'Can we count
on your support, ambassador?'

04:16.750 --> 04:20.208
What you are asking
could be considered treason.

04:20.292 --> 04:22.542
Or the first step
in restoring our people

04:22.625 --> 04:25.042
to their rightful place
in the galaxy.

04:25.125 --> 04:28.417
Depending on who writes
the history books.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.167
I think it will be us.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.875
'What do you think?'

04:31.958 --> 04:35.000
[intense music]

04:35.917 --> 04:37.667
I think..

04:38.917 --> 04:41.917
...that we have a great deal
of work ahead of us.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.042
[glasses clinks]

04:55.208 --> 04:57.292
[indistinct chatter]

05:04.417 --> 05:07.458
[dramatic music]

05:10.000 --> 05:12.042
[grunting]

05:17.000 --> 05:19.208
[clamoring]

05:19.292 --> 05:20.542
Security to Station House.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.250
'We have a Drazi fight
in the bazaar.'

05:22.333 --> 05:25.000
'I need a full
tactical team, ASAP.'

05:27.667 --> 05:31.875
(Sheridan)
The Babylon Project was
our last, best hope for peace.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.333
A self-contained world,
five miles long

05:36.417 --> 05:38.583
located in neutral territory.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.667
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

05:41.750 --> 05:45.083
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

05:47.833 --> 05:49.917
A shining beacon in space

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
all alone in the night.

05:53.083 --> 05:56.458
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind.

05:56.542 --> 05:59.417
The year the great war
came upon us all.

06:01.083 --> 06:05.167
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.250
The year is 2259.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.375
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

06:10.458 --> 06:13.500
[theme music]

06:43.417 --> 06:46.500
[music continues]

06:56.875 --> 06:59.375
[instrumental music]

07:01.833 --> 07:03.708
(Londo)
'Goodbye, Refa.'

07:03.792 --> 07:06.042
You will give my regards
to the others, hmm?

07:06.125 --> 07:07.667
Of course.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.500
For a long time,
they've been looking for a sign

07:10.583 --> 07:11.750
that it's time for our people

07:11.833 --> 07:14.750
to step forward again
into history.

07:14.833 --> 07:18.750
I will try very hard to
convince them that you are it.

07:20.042 --> 07:22.167
See you again soon, Mollari.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.333
[indistinct chatter on speaker]

07:34.208 --> 07:36.500
Great Maker.

07:36.583 --> 07:38.167
- What?
- A techno-mage.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.333
- 'Looks like a human.'
- 'What's a techno-mage?'

07:41.417 --> 07:43.500
We used to have them back home,
long ago.

07:43.583 --> 07:47.417
They use science to achieve
the effect of magic.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.917
I haven't seen one in years.
They almost never travel.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.250
'They don't like to leave
their places of power.'

07:53.333 --> 07:56.375
To see even one of them
is a rare thing.

07:56.458 --> 07:58.750
To see more than one at a time..

07:58.833 --> 08:01.875
...is considered
a very bad omen.

08:01.958 --> 08:05.000
[intense music]

08:13.042 --> 08:15.375
Three.

08:15.458 --> 08:18.208
This is definitely not good.

08:18.292 --> 08:20.625
How long has this fighting
been going on?

08:20.708 --> 08:23.083
It's been building
for the last couple of weeks.

08:23.167 --> 08:24.958
- It's a cultural thing.
- Hm.

08:25.042 --> 08:28.000
Once every five years,
all the Drazi here and at home

08:28.083 --> 08:31.292
'divide up into two camps
and fight it out.'

08:31.375 --> 08:33.000
But it's not a fight
to the death?

08:33.083 --> 08:36.958
No. Just until the loser gives
up or is knocked senseless.

08:37.042 --> 08:38.750
Whichever side wins the most
victories becomes

08:38.833 --> 08:40.583
the dominant group
for the next five years

08:40.667 --> 08:42.500
when it starts all over again.

08:42.583 --> 08:46.208
Actually, the timing of this
may work out to be a good thing.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.083
I have decided
that it is time for you

08:48.167 --> 08:51.667
to start learning
the fine art of diplomacy.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.458
'If you could handle
the low-priority conflicts'

08:53.542 --> 08:55.958
'it would help me to focus
on the other problems.'

08:56.042 --> 09:00.250
Besides, added responsibility
comes with any promotion.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.792
'I know it's annoying
and inconvenient but--'

09:02.875 --> 09:04.458
Did you say promotion?

09:04.542 --> 09:06.292
Yes, would you like some juice?

09:06.375 --> 09:08.250
It's fresh
from the hydroponic garden.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.292
I told them
to leave the pulp in.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.958
That's the best part,
don't you think..

09:14.042 --> 09:16.125
...commander?

09:16.208 --> 09:19.750
I pushed through the paperwork
the day after I got here.

09:19.833 --> 09:21.083
I think you more than earned it.

09:21.167 --> 09:22.458
- I don't know what to say.
- Well!

09:22.542 --> 09:25.125
Thank you would be
a good place to start.

09:25.208 --> 09:26.125
Thank you.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.292
Now, your first job will be

09:27.375 --> 09:28.500
to find a peaceful solution

09:28.583 --> 09:30.458
to the Drazi problem, okay?

09:30.542 --> 09:31.917
'And if you'll excuse me..'

09:32.000 --> 09:34.542
...I have to pay a visit
to someone.

09:35.958 --> 09:37.958
[sighs]

09:39.208 --> 09:41.292
[indistinct chattering]

09:42.708 --> 09:45.792
[intense music]

09:47.125 --> 09:49.208
[indistinct whispering]

09:51.625 --> 09:53.667
[hissing]

10:04.625 --> 10:07.875
Oh, ambassador, there you are.

10:07.958 --> 10:09.750
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

10:09.833 --> 10:11.833
The Abbai delegation
is waiting to see you.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.333
Th-they had an appointment.
They want to talk about.. Oh.

10:15.708 --> 10:18.667
On the other hand, maybe
I'll just sit here for a while.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.000
Vir..

10:21.083 --> 10:24.250
...do you believe in fate?

10:24.333 --> 10:26.917
Well, actually..

10:27.000 --> 10:29.917
...I believe there are currents
in the universe.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.208
Eddies and tides that, that
pull us one way or the other.

10:34.292 --> 10:37.625
Some we have to fight,
some we have to embrace.

10:37.708 --> 10:40.375
Unfortunately, the currents
that we have to fight

10:40.458 --> 10:43.000
look exactly like the currents
we have to embrace.

10:43.083 --> 10:45.250
The-the currents
that we think are the ones

10:45.333 --> 10:46.833
that's gonna make us stronger

10:46.917 --> 10:49.167
they're the ones
that are going to destroy us.

10:49.250 --> 10:51.292
And the ones that we think
are going to destroy us

10:51.375 --> 10:53.208
they're the ones
that are gonna make us stronger.

10:53.292 --> 10:55.708
- Now the other currents--
- Vir!

10:55.792 --> 10:59.208
- Yes or no?
- Y-y-yes.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.542
You know, somewhat. Why?

11:02.625 --> 11:05.375
I was thinking about
what Refa said before he left.

11:05.458 --> 11:08.333
That they're looking
for a sign back home.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.583
Before our first emperor
took the throne

11:10.667 --> 11:12.250
of the Centauri Republic

11:12.333 --> 11:15.292
he consulted three techno-mages

11:15.375 --> 11:16.750
who gave him their blessing.

11:16.833 --> 11:19.625
Now that is an image
that is very powerful

11:19.708 --> 11:23.417
for those of us who
still believe in the old ways.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.583
If they want me to help
restore the Republic

11:26.667 --> 11:28.083
it wouldn't hurt for our people

11:28.167 --> 11:31.708
to associate me
with the emperor.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.208
I will consult them.

11:33.292 --> 11:36.375
It will have considerable
influence back home.

11:36.458 --> 11:39.458
Go to them. Arrange it.
I'll be in my quarters.

11:39.542 --> 11:42.542
Londo, I really don't think
I wanna do this.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.042
Londo!

11:44.125 --> 11:46.125
[sighs]

12:00.542 --> 12:02.042
[thuds]

12:02.125 --> 12:05.167
[intense music]

12:14.417 --> 12:16.292
Yeah, come in.

12:22.292 --> 12:24.208
Mr. Garibaldi.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.333
Captain.

12:28.417 --> 12:31.333
I've been expecting you
to come by for some time.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.958
Since you hadn't, I..

12:33.042 --> 12:36.292
...decided the mountain
should visit Mohammed after all.

12:36.375 --> 12:38.458
'Good to see you on your feet.'

12:38.542 --> 12:40.333
I talked to Dr. Franklin.

12:40.417 --> 12:43.125
He says you can come back
to work anytime you want.

12:43.208 --> 12:45.583
'What do you say?'

12:45.667 --> 12:47.542
I don't know.

12:50.042 --> 12:52.250
'I don't know if I'm ready
to come back or..'

12:55.375 --> 12:58.500
...or if you want me
to come back.

12:58.583 --> 12:59.833
Maybe it'd just be easier
on everybody

12:59.917 --> 13:02.000
if I resigned and moved on.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.625
Probably.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.375
The universe doesn't give you
any points

13:07.458 --> 13:09.583
for doing things
that are easy.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.125
Your record is..

13:15.042 --> 13:18.125
...colorful, to say the least.

13:18.208 --> 13:19.458
Everything I've heard suggests

13:19.542 --> 13:21.667
that you know this station
better than anyone else.

13:21.750 --> 13:25.417
I would be foolish to throw away
a valuable resource..

13:25.500 --> 13:28.833
...without at least trying
to work together.

13:28.917 --> 13:31.708
I need someone I can trust
running security.

13:31.792 --> 13:33.250
I'd like it to be you.

13:33.333 --> 13:37.708
Now if you decide you'd rather
be someplace else..

13:37.792 --> 13:39.667
...I'll understand.

13:41.667 --> 13:44.333
I'll hold your job open
as long as I can.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.250
Don't take too long, okay?

13:52.125 --> 13:53.958
[door closes]

13:54.042 --> 13:55.917
(Ivanova)
'As you all know, we're having
a bit of a problem'

13:56.000 --> 13:57.250
'here right now.'

13:57.333 --> 13:58.917
'The aforementioned problem
being that'

13:59.000 --> 14:00.583
'you keep trying
to beat each other senseless'

14:00.667 --> 14:02.292
'with blunt instruments
and banging up'

14:02.375 --> 14:06.000
'against the bulkhead,
pounding, mugging'

14:06.083 --> 14:08.917
'jumping and generally
carrying on cranky.'

14:09.000 --> 14:10.958
'Now, while some of the other
species wouldn't mind'

14:11.042 --> 14:12.792
if you wiped each other out..

14:12.875 --> 14:15.583
...even they would prefer
that you did so quietly.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.708
But this station is dedicated
to the goal of finding

14:18.792 --> 14:21.208
peaceful solutions
to our problems.

14:21.292 --> 14:23.417
'And we would like to find
one here.'

14:23.500 --> 14:25.208
Now you can start
by helping me to understand

14:25.292 --> 14:26.875
the precise nature
of the conflict

14:26.958 --> 14:29.583
between the two sides
that you've set up.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.958
Green.

14:32.042 --> 14:33.167
Purple.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.750
No, I understand
there are two factions

14:34.833 --> 14:36.958
but what is your point
of contention?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.375
And where do you disagree
with each other?

14:38.458 --> 14:41.333
[sighs]
Purple.

14:41.417 --> 14:42.667
Green.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.625
Yes, but who gets to wear
the purple sash

14:44.708 --> 14:46.167
and who gets to wear
the green sash?

14:46.250 --> 14:48.625
I mean, is it based on income
or caste or rank or--

14:48.708 --> 14:52.042
We put green and purple
in great barrel.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.333
Equal to numbers of Drazi.

14:54.417 --> 14:56.917
'Then we reach in, we take.'

14:57.000 --> 15:01.125
Where there was one
Drazi people, now there are two.

15:01.208 --> 15:04.333
The two fight
until there are one.

15:06.750 --> 15:10.000
That's it?
I mean i-it's totally random?

15:10.083 --> 15:12.375
Arbitrary?

15:12.458 --> 15:14.583
Well, then how do you choose
the leader for either side?

15:14.667 --> 15:19.042
One purple and one green
carries mark of leadership.

15:19.125 --> 15:21.792
He who takes leader cloth
is leader.

15:21.875 --> 15:25.167
He who takes green is Green
and follows Green leader.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.667
He who takes purple is Purple

15:27.750 --> 15:30.667
and follows Purple leader.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.500
[sighs]
Okay, so in other words..

15:33.583 --> 15:36.375
Would you two please step
forward for a minute, please?

15:37.458 --> 15:39.542
[indistinct chattering]

15:40.792 --> 15:43.375
Okay, so what
you're trying to tell me

15:43.458 --> 15:46.667
is that if I take this
purple sash

15:46.750 --> 15:51.792
off of him
and put it onto him..

15:51.875 --> 15:54.833
...that this one thing alone
is enough to start a..

15:54.917 --> 15:57.042
[shouting]

15:57.125 --> 16:00.042
[dramatic music]

16:00.125 --> 16:02.167
[screaming]

16:05.500 --> 16:07.042
Hello?

16:07.125 --> 16:09.167
[indistinct whispering]

16:17.417 --> 16:19.500
I am Vir Cotto

16:19.583 --> 16:22.750
diplomatic attache
to Ambassador Londo Mollari

16:22.833 --> 16:25.208
of the Centauri Republic.

16:25.292 --> 16:27.583
I'm told by the people
running that way

16:27.667 --> 16:30.792
that this is where
I can find the techno-mages.

16:30.875 --> 16:33.833
I'm here on behalf
of Ambassador Mollari..

16:33.917 --> 16:36.792
...and I need to speak
to someone who is in charge.

16:36.875 --> 16:38.458
[door closes]

16:38.542 --> 16:42.083
Obviously, it would be
at your earliest convenience.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.708
[growling]

16:44.792 --> 16:47.833
[intense music]

16:54.667 --> 16:56.667
[growling]

16:58.917 --> 17:00.958
[growling]

17:07.792 --> 17:10.625
My name is Vir Cotto,
diplomatic attache

17:10.708 --> 17:14.375
to Ambassador Londo Mollari
of the Centauri Republic.

17:14.458 --> 17:16.458
My name is Vir Cotto,
diplomatic attache

17:16.542 --> 17:19.667
to Ambassador Londo Mollari
of the Centauri Republic.

17:19.750 --> 17:23.542
- My name is--
- 'Stop program.'

17:23.625 --> 17:26.292
[zaps]

17:26.375 --> 17:28.667
You don't frighten easily.

17:28.750 --> 17:31.208
I work for Ambassador Mollari.

17:31.292 --> 17:34.083
After a while,
nothing bothers you.

17:34.167 --> 17:36.208
[zaps]

17:36.292 --> 17:39.250
And what does your master
want with me?

17:39.333 --> 17:42.125
My employer
requests an audience.

17:42.208 --> 17:45.500
I'm sorry,
neither I nor my brothers

17:45.583 --> 17:48.583
do private audiences.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.833
We have nothing more
to say to anyone

17:50.917 --> 17:52.875
on this side
of the Galactic Rim.

17:52.958 --> 17:55.792
Aha, but he's willing to pay.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.500
Money is also irrelevant.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.708
Where we are going,
it will do us no good.

18:00.792 --> 18:02.667
Let me put this another way.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.667
If I go back without a yes

18:04.750 --> 18:08.833
the personal consequences will
be profoundly unfortunate, okay.

18:08.917 --> 18:11.000
And if you try
to force us to walk

18:11.083 --> 18:13.667
where we do not choose to walk..

18:13.750 --> 18:18.625
...the consequences
will even be more unfortunate.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.833
[intense music]

18:20.917 --> 18:23.042
Excuse me.

18:23.125 --> 18:25.417
Could I at least get a name?

18:25.500 --> 18:27.417
Elric.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.792
There is an old saying

18:29.875 --> 18:33.208
"Do not try the patience
of wizards..

18:33.292 --> 18:36.875
...for they are subtle
and quick to anger."

18:36.958 --> 18:40.667
Do not come again, Vir Cotto.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.042
Ow!

18:48.125 --> 18:50.375
Come on, doc,
there's gotta be another way.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.708
Your foot is broken
in three places.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.708
Now, I've fused the larger break
but the other two

18:54.792 --> 18:56.875
are delicate bones
in difficult places

18:56.958 --> 19:00.042
and if I fuse them,
you might lose some agility.

19:00.125 --> 19:02.083
Now, I can speed up the process

19:02.167 --> 19:04.917
so they'll heal in three weeks
rather than nine but..

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
...you will have to wear a cast.

19:07.083 --> 19:09.833
- And it's gonna hurt.
- Swell.

19:09.917 --> 19:11.333
Ow.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.750
I can give you something
for the pain.

19:13.833 --> 19:17.167
Oh, great, now you can give me
something for the pain.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.583
Where were you when
I was going through puberty?

19:19.667 --> 19:21.833
No, it's okay,
I'll get used to it.

19:21.917 --> 19:24.708
If it gets too bad, I'll just
gnaw it off at the ankle.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.500
- Ah, captain.
- Commander.

19:29.583 --> 19:32.625
Doctor, could I speak to her
for a moment?

19:32.708 --> 19:35.792
- Sure.
- Thank you.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.583
Not exactly an
auspicious beginning

19:37.667 --> 19:40.542
to my diplomatic career.

19:40.625 --> 19:42.292
We learn by doing.

19:42.375 --> 19:43.750
And in the process
you're gonna fall

19:43.833 --> 19:45.542
on your face a few times.

19:45.625 --> 19:48.833
Though I didn't think you'd
take it quite that literally.

19:48.917 --> 19:51.167
So, what's your next move?

19:51.250 --> 19:53.250
[sighs]
Other than sticking
the Drazi in a ship

19:53.333 --> 19:54.917
and firing it into the sun?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.792
[chuckling]
Other than that, yes.

19:57.875 --> 20:01.250
Ah, on the other hand, look, uh

20:01.333 --> 20:02.875
you got pretty banged up there.

20:02.958 --> 20:04.250
If you wanna give it
a day or two--

20:04.333 --> 20:06.292
No, no, I started this

20:06.375 --> 20:07.917
and, by God
I'm gonna finish it.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.417
Getting them together to resolve
their differences didn't work

20:10.500 --> 20:13.125
because they don't have
any difference to resolve.

20:13.208 --> 20:15.667
So maybe I've gotta come at this
from another angle.

20:15.750 --> 20:19.000
Maybe find a nonviolent way
to structure the conflicts

20:19.083 --> 20:20.292
that nobody gets hurt.

20:20.375 --> 20:23.583
Good. I agree 100%.

20:23.667 --> 20:28.125
So, uh, keep me informed,
and take care of that foot.

20:28.208 --> 20:29.167
Well, don't you wanna be there?

20:29.250 --> 20:30.208
I have absolute trust

20:30.292 --> 20:31.542
in your abilities, commander.

20:31.625 --> 20:33.708
Well, that's a hell of a thing
to tell someone.

20:33.792 --> 20:35.792
Ha! No pressure.

20:35.875 --> 20:38.083
Fine, fine.

20:38.167 --> 20:39.667
Ivanova, security.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.250
Tell the Drazi
we'll meet in chambers

20:41.333 --> 20:43.417
and we'll try this again.

20:45.042 --> 20:47.542
As soon as I can figure out
how to stand up.

20:49.042 --> 20:53.000
(Vir)
'Then he said,
"Don't come here again."'

20:53.083 --> 20:54.500
That's it?

20:54.583 --> 20:56.708
Unacceptable.
You'll have to go back.

20:56.792 --> 20:58.750
It won't work.
They're not for sale.

20:58.833 --> 21:00.167
No? And how do you know?

21:00.250 --> 21:02.250
It's just something in the way
he looks at you.

21:02.333 --> 21:03.833
Something in his voice.

21:03.917 --> 21:05.667
Londo, they're going away.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.292
Money doesn't matter to them,
power doesn't matter to them.

21:08.375 --> 21:12.000
- Money and power always matter.
- Not to them.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.625
I don't think it's a good idea
for anyone

21:13.708 --> 21:16.125
to get between them
and where they're going.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.500
Ah!

21:17.583 --> 21:19.333
Being seen with them

21:19.417 --> 21:20.458
being given their blessing

21:20.542 --> 21:23.667
would be a powerful symbol
back home.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.542
But if they won't come to me

21:25.625 --> 21:27.500
perhaps they will come
to someone else.

21:27.583 --> 21:30.542
Someone they can't ignore.
I'll be right back.

21:34.292 --> 21:36.875
[dramatic music]

21:36.958 --> 21:39.375
Hey, chief. How you doing?

21:39.458 --> 21:41.250
Hey, Lou.

21:41.333 --> 21:45.500
- Fine, fine. You?
- Oh, you know, the usual.

21:45.583 --> 21:47.375
Me and the rest of the guys,
we were wondering..

21:47.458 --> 21:50.083
...when're you
gonna come back on duty?

21:50.167 --> 21:52.042
Look, we bought a cake, alright?

21:52.125 --> 21:53.542
It's been sitting there
for two days now.

21:53.625 --> 21:55.167
Are you kidding me?

21:55.250 --> 21:58.375
You pass up a cake for two days?
What's the deal?

21:58.458 --> 22:00.083
What've you done
with the real Lou Welch, huh?

22:00.167 --> 22:01.375
Hey, Security!
Security, over here!

22:01.458 --> 22:03.875
We got another guy
with a changeling net.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.792
Seriously, chief,
when you coming back?

22:09.875 --> 22:11.542
Everybody misses you.

22:11.625 --> 22:13.292
Y'know, it's just, uh..

22:13.375 --> 22:15.917
You know, it ain't been
the same without you.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.417
Soon.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.458
- Real soon now.
- Welch.

22:19.542 --> 22:21.792
(woman on speaker)
'We've got another
Drazi fight in Brown three'

22:21.875 --> 22:23.000
'code blue.'

22:23.083 --> 22:24.875
On my way.

22:24.958 --> 22:26.083
I gotta go.

22:26.167 --> 22:28.083
Catch you later?

22:32.042 --> 22:34.000
[sighs]

22:34.083 --> 22:37.250
Then you are familiar
with the techno-mages, hm?

22:37.333 --> 22:39.500
(John)
Only by name and reputation.

22:39.583 --> 22:42.292
I've never seen one before,
I wasn't really sure

22:42.375 --> 22:44.208
they even existed before now.

22:44.292 --> 22:48.083
Ah, most unfortunate.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.458
On my world, we have had

22:49.542 --> 22:51.917
considerable experience
with them.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.750
'They can be a source of
great trouble.'

22:54.833 --> 22:57.917
Unless one knows
how to deal with them.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.583
- And you do?
- Of course.

23:02.042 --> 23:03.417
With so many here at one time

23:03.500 --> 23:08.083
and you being new
to Babylon 5, and your..

23:08.167 --> 23:11.125
Well, your inexperience
in such matters, no offense.

23:11.208 --> 23:12.625
Oh, none taken.

23:12.708 --> 23:15.458
It has occurred to me
that I could be

23:15.542 --> 23:19.375
of some small assistance
in averting trouble.

23:19.458 --> 23:21.292
And what would you get
out of it?

23:21.375 --> 23:23.167
Oh.

23:23.250 --> 23:26.125
A clear conscience
and a peaceful sleep.

23:27.708 --> 23:30.583
As it happens..

23:30.667 --> 23:33.125
...I just heard about their
presence about an hour ago.

23:33.208 --> 23:36.708
They're definitely emigrating
but won't say where.

23:36.792 --> 23:39.208
Earth wants more information
before letting them go.

23:39.292 --> 23:43.125
So this is as good
an opportunity as any.

23:43.208 --> 23:44.500
I'll set up a meeting.

23:44.583 --> 23:46.667
- 9 o'clock?
- I'll be there.

23:46.750 --> 23:49.000
I'm pleased, captain,
that our first discussions

23:49.083 --> 23:51.500
have gone so smoothly.

23:51.583 --> 23:55.083
I'm looking forward
to many more in the future.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.458
Until later, then.

23:57.542 --> 23:59.333
[intense music]

23:59.417 --> 24:01.458
(man on speaker)
'Commander Ivanova,
I thought you should know.'

24:01.542 --> 24:03.833
'We just received news
from the Drazi Homeworld.'

24:03.917 --> 24:06.500
Make my day and tell me this
stupid fighting is over with.

24:06.583 --> 24:08.958
(man on speaker)
'Just the opposite.
The Greens upped the ante.'

24:09.042 --> 24:11.542
'They've started killing
Purples, not just hurting them.'

24:11.625 --> 24:13.167
Have the local Drazi
heard about this yet?

24:13.250 --> 24:15.292
- 'I don't know.'
- I need a full tactical squad.

24:15.375 --> 24:17.667
- I need it now!
- 'On the way.'

24:27.583 --> 24:30.625
[dramatic music]

24:34.042 --> 24:37.000
[dramatic music]

24:40.292 --> 24:42.958
Captain, I insist

24:43.042 --> 24:44.792
that neither I
nor any of my clan

24:44.875 --> 24:48.500
represent any threat
whatsoever to this station.

24:48.583 --> 24:49.958
So you say.

24:50.042 --> 24:52.042
But you have to understand
that when something like this

24:52.125 --> 24:55.000
comes to my attention
I have to look into it.

24:55.083 --> 24:56.458
And there are an awful
lot of you here

24:56.542 --> 24:58.708
over a 100 according
to security.

24:58.792 --> 25:01.292
And you refuse to tell Earth
Central where you're going?

25:01.375 --> 25:04.083
We have a right to go
where we wish

25:04.167 --> 25:07.208
when we wish,
with as many as we wish

25:07.292 --> 25:09.833
without being harassed,
questioned or detained.

25:09.917 --> 25:11.750
I am not looking
to cause you trouble.

25:11.833 --> 25:14.542
I just would like some
questions answered, that's all.

25:14.625 --> 25:17.083
Ahem.
Sorry to be late, gentlemen.

25:17.167 --> 25:19.833
I was unavoidably detained.

25:19.917 --> 25:22.917
Matters of state.
You understand.

25:24.667 --> 25:28.750
I can tell by the sense
of joy permeating the room

25:28.833 --> 25:31.708
that I was right to offer
my services as a mediator.

25:31.792 --> 25:34.583
Is this the one who brought us
to your attention?

25:34.667 --> 25:36.417
Only after I'd heard
about your situation

25:36.500 --> 25:37.708
at my security briefing.

25:37.792 --> 25:41.208
Captain, you've been used.

25:41.292 --> 25:44.208
This creature has been seeking

25:44.292 --> 25:46.458
an audience with me
ever since I arrived.

25:46.542 --> 25:49.542
- Is this true?
- Absolutely not.

25:50.875 --> 25:54.000
My name is Vir Cotto,
diplomatic attache

25:54.083 --> 25:58.500
to Ambassador Londo Mollari
of the Centauri Republic.

25:58.583 --> 26:03.542
My employer requests
an audience.

26:03.625 --> 26:06.042
You were saying?

26:06.125 --> 26:07.958
Recording a conversation.

26:08.042 --> 26:10.542
'A very low thing to do.'

26:10.625 --> 26:13.333
But in the interest
of good relations

26:13.417 --> 26:15.625
I'm willing to forgive.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.417
I offer the hands of friendship.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.292
I accept.

26:21.375 --> 26:24.125
I assume you will not take
advantage of this gesture

26:24.208 --> 26:28.542
or misrepresent it
as some sort of endorsement.

26:28.625 --> 26:31.750
Oh, of course not.

26:31.833 --> 26:34.583
[explosion]

26:34.667 --> 26:38.083
Risky business,
condemning my recording device

26:38.167 --> 26:39.667
while using one of your own.

26:39.750 --> 26:43.417
- I can explain everything.
- I do not like to be used!

26:43.500 --> 26:46.292
You must learn manners
and respect.

26:46.375 --> 26:50.292
From this moment on, you will.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.125
(John)
'I think you should leave,
ambassador.'

26:52.208 --> 26:54.000
Before I decide to report
your attempt

26:54.083 --> 26:55.958
to bug my office
and send you back home

26:56.042 --> 26:58.667
on the slowest transport
I can find.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.417
Of course. My apologies.

27:04.042 --> 27:07.125
I apologize for that incident
with Ambassador Mollari

27:07.208 --> 27:10.625
but there are still some
questions that I need answered.

27:10.708 --> 27:14.250
Where you're going,
what's this group all about?

27:14.333 --> 27:16.375
Captain..

27:16.458 --> 27:19.875
...do you believe there is
such a thing as magic?

27:21.750 --> 27:25.208
Well, when I was 12,
I used to sit in my dad's garden

27:25.292 --> 27:27.958
the air full of the smell
of orange blossoms

27:28.042 --> 27:32.333
watching the sky,
dreaming of faraway places.

27:32.417 --> 27:35.708
Back then, I think I believed
in just about everything.

27:35.792 --> 27:38.667
But now, I don't know.

27:38.750 --> 27:42.958
I do think there are some things
we don't understand.

27:43.042 --> 27:45.917
If we went back in time
a 1000 years

27:46.000 --> 27:49.250
and tried to explain
this place to people

27:49.333 --> 27:52.167
they could only accept it
in terms of magic.

27:52.250 --> 27:55.250
Then perhaps, it is magic.

27:55.333 --> 27:57.708
The magic of the human heart.

27:57.792 --> 28:01.625
Focused and made manifest
by technology.

28:01.708 --> 28:05.750
Every day you here create
greater miracles

28:05.833 --> 28:07.250
than the burning bush.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.583
Maybe.

28:09.667 --> 28:12.583
But God was there first and
he didn't need solar batteries

28:12.667 --> 28:14.375
and a fusion reactor to do it.

28:14.458 --> 28:17.083
Perhaps. Perhaps not.

28:17.167 --> 28:21.500
It is within that ambiguity
that my brothers and I exist.

28:21.583 --> 28:25.458
'We are dreamers, shapers,
singers and makers.'

28:25.542 --> 28:29.583
We study the mysteries
of laser and circuit

28:29.667 --> 28:32.792
crystal and scanner,
holographic demons

28:32.875 --> 28:35.958
and invocations of equations.

28:36.042 --> 28:38.458
These are the tools we employ.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.667
And we know many things.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.125
- Such as?
- 'The true secrets.'

28:43.208 --> 28:44.792
The important things.

28:44.875 --> 28:48.333
Fourteen words to make someone
fall in love with you forever.

28:48.417 --> 28:51.250
Seven words to make them
go without pain.

28:51.333 --> 28:54.333
How to say goodbye
to a friend who is dying?

28:54.417 --> 28:58.375
How to be poor?
How to be rich?

28:58.458 --> 29:00.625
How to rediscover dreams

29:00.708 --> 29:03.833
when the world has stolen
them from you?

29:03.917 --> 29:05.958
'That is why we are going away.'

29:06.042 --> 29:08.792
- 'To preserve that knowledge.'
- From what?

29:08.875 --> 29:12.625
There is a storm coming.
A black and terrible storm.

29:13.833 --> 29:15.375
We would not have
our knowledge lost

29:15.458 --> 29:17.458
or used to ill purpose.

29:17.542 --> 29:21.375
From this place, we will launch
ourselves into the stars.

29:22.875 --> 29:27.667
With luck, you will never see
our kind again in your lifetime.

29:27.750 --> 29:30.000
I know you have
your orders, captain.

29:30.083 --> 29:32.333
Detain us if you wish.

29:32.417 --> 29:35.125
But I cannot tell you
where we're going.

29:35.208 --> 29:38.542
I can only ask you to trust us.

29:38.625 --> 29:41.667
[dramatic music]

29:58.083 --> 29:59.875
Orange blossom.

30:05.625 --> 30:07.333
I wanna see the leader
of the Greens.

30:07.417 --> 30:09.208
We just had another
Drazi killed.

30:09.292 --> 30:11.042
Natural selection.

30:11.125 --> 30:13.500
- Do not interfere.
- I have to.

30:13.583 --> 30:16.125
I can't have this station
disrupted any further.

30:16.208 --> 30:19.583
This has to stop
and it has to stop now.

30:19.667 --> 30:22.375
Look, I just hobbled all the way
over from Blue Sector.

30:22.458 --> 30:24.625
You could at least
let me talk to him.

30:24.708 --> 30:27.750
[intense music]

30:43.125 --> 30:45.167
[door closes]

30:50.708 --> 30:54.000
Drazi stronghold.
Not place for humans.

30:55.125 --> 30:58.500
You do not talk polite to Drazi.

30:58.583 --> 31:01.625
But because you hurt by Drazi

31:01.708 --> 31:05.750
I welcome you.
Rise above our differences.

31:05.833 --> 31:08.542
Our differences
is not the issue.

31:08.625 --> 31:10.167
The issue is Drazi
killing each other

31:10.250 --> 31:11.500
here and on your homeworld.

31:11.583 --> 31:13.750
Would you prefer
we murder humans?

31:13.833 --> 31:15.792
Look, I came here to help,
but if you don't wanna hear--

31:15.875 --> 31:19.208
No, no, we take help.
I have solution to our problem.

31:19.292 --> 31:20.417
Go on.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.333
(male #1)
'You tell Purple Drazi'

31:22.417 --> 31:24.125
'to gather in Brown 29.'

31:24.208 --> 31:27.292
Not used by others.
Will not be disturbed.

31:27.375 --> 31:30.208
Talk peace talk.
Find solution.

31:30.292 --> 31:34.417
- If you tell, they will trust.
- Alright, then what?

31:34.500 --> 31:38.292
Then when all Purple Drazi
in one place..

31:38.375 --> 31:39.792
...open hatch to space.

31:39.875 --> 31:43.458
Flush oxygen, vacuum.
Purple Drazi cannot breathe.

31:43.542 --> 31:46.417
All Purple Drazi,
all Purple Drazi, die.

31:46.500 --> 31:50.208
Station is quiet again.
No more fighting.

31:50.292 --> 31:51.708
Green Drazi win. You win.

31:51.792 --> 31:55.000
- Everybody, everybody win.
- I don't believe this!

31:55.083 --> 31:56.750
You're talking about
the cold-blooded slaughter

31:56.833 --> 31:59.208
of almost 2000 Drazi!

31:59.292 --> 32:01.292
Don't you understand?
These are your own people!

32:01.375 --> 32:03.333
No, Purple!

32:03.417 --> 32:05.292
Purple.

32:05.375 --> 32:08.875
- You will help?
- No.

32:08.958 --> 32:11.208
Ah, great shame.

32:11.292 --> 32:14.333
We already sent word
to Purple to come.

32:14.417 --> 32:16.208
Use your name.

32:16.292 --> 32:18.500
You will stay here
until we are done.

32:18.583 --> 32:21.375
Ivanova, security..

32:21.458 --> 32:24.167
Now we finish this our way.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.917
[intense music]

32:35.250 --> 32:38.000
Oh, woah, woah, Lou. What's
going on? What's the commotion?

32:38.083 --> 32:39.667
Got an uplink from
Commander Ivanova.

32:39.750 --> 32:43.708
We gotta clear out Brown 29
for some big Drazi meeting.

32:43.792 --> 32:45.583
Commander? Good for her.

32:45.667 --> 32:48.250
Glad to see things are working
out for someone around here.

32:48.333 --> 32:50.042
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

32:50.125 --> 32:52.042
Lou, you said you got an uplink,
not a personal message?

32:52.125 --> 32:53.958
Yeah, but we checked
the ID on the data flow.

32:54.042 --> 32:55.208
- It came from her link.
- Yeah.

32:55.292 --> 32:56.875
I know, I know,
but did you talk to her?

32:56.958 --> 32:59.083
No, the message said she was
gonna be off-line for a while.

32:59.167 --> 33:00.583
- Look, I gotta go.
- Alright. Hey, hey.

33:00.667 --> 33:02.042
Wh-where was she
last time you talked to her?

33:02.125 --> 33:04.417
Alien Sector. Uh, Brown 2.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.542
(Ivanova)
'What does it take
to get through to you?'

33:08.625 --> 33:11.667
'You're making a mistake
of galactic proportions!'

33:11.750 --> 33:15.208
Assaulting an earth alliance
officer, attempting mass--

33:15.292 --> 33:16.625
Green must fight Purple.

33:16.708 --> 33:20.792
Purple must fight Green.
Is no other way.

33:20.875 --> 33:23.750
Just my luck. I get stuck with a
race that speaks only in macros.

33:23.833 --> 33:25.833
[banging]

33:31.042 --> 33:34.083
[intense music]

33:36.167 --> 33:38.083
Well, how do you do, sir, I'm
looking for the lady of house

33:38.167 --> 33:40.750
assuming you're not
the lady of the house.

33:40.833 --> 33:42.917
Anyway I'm here
to sell you something

33:43.000 --> 33:45.625
to make your life easier,
cleaner and all around happier.

33:45.708 --> 33:48.500
Yes, sir, the Acme Handy-Dandy
Micro Helper

33:48.583 --> 33:49.917
right here in this box.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.833
If you just allow me
to demonstrate, this will

33:51.917 --> 33:53.583
only take a moment.
Well, well, well.

33:53.667 --> 33:56.000
I can see this is gonna
be a hard sell.

33:56.083 --> 33:58.958
This is just my little way
of helping, so trust me, okay?

33:59.042 --> 34:01.083
Ah, well, as a matter of fact
if there's anybody in here

34:01.167 --> 34:04.542
who needs a little help
just say the word and I'm here.

34:04.625 --> 34:05.875
Garibaldi!

34:05.958 --> 34:08.000
[grunting]

34:11.542 --> 34:13.583
[electric crackling]

34:15.417 --> 34:16.583
Ambassador?

34:16.667 --> 34:19.083
(Londo)
'Here.'

34:19.167 --> 34:21.167
[sighs]

34:23.542 --> 34:25.875
Look. A holo-demon.

34:25.958 --> 34:27.833
'It has possessed
my data system'

34:27.917 --> 34:32.667
consuming records,
personal files...everything.

34:32.750 --> 34:34.750
Twenty minutes ago it gathered
together the pieces

34:34.833 --> 34:37.125
of my personal financial account

34:37.208 --> 34:39.125
it cast an equation spell.

34:39.208 --> 34:42.792
I now own 200,000 shares
in a spoo ranch.

34:42.875 --> 34:44.167
And that sound.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.667
- T-t-that hideous sound!
- It's Narn opera.

34:47.750 --> 34:48.958
[grunts]

34:49.042 --> 34:51.375
Our friend the Techno-mage
has an especially

34:51.458 --> 34:53.292
perverse sense of humor.

34:53.375 --> 34:56.625
'I have to find a way
to stop this.'

34:56.708 --> 34:58.583
You could always..

34:58.667 --> 34:59.625
...apologize.

34:59.708 --> 35:02.042
Apologize? Never!

35:03.625 --> 35:04.917
(automated message on computer)
Congratulations.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.458
You are now the owner of

35:06.542 --> 35:10.917
500,000 shares
of Fireflies Incorporated.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.500
[crackling]

35:13.583 --> 35:15.292
(Londo)
'On the other hand..'

35:15.375 --> 35:18.417
[intense music]

35:20.667 --> 35:23.208
Going somewhere?

35:23.292 --> 35:26.000
Guess what,
it looks like the Purple Drazi

35:26.083 --> 35:29.208
bought that story of yours about
one big fight to the death.

35:29.292 --> 35:31.375
They're waiting for you
in Brown 29.

35:31.458 --> 35:33.667
'Now, I can't let you
space them as appealing'

35:33.750 --> 35:35.125
as that idea sounds
at the moment

35:35.208 --> 35:37.042
but we do have another solution.

35:37.125 --> 35:39.375
As long as they're all together
in one place like that

35:39.458 --> 35:40.708
we're gonna keep them there
for a while.

35:40.792 --> 35:43.500
- How long?
- Uh, just a few days.

35:43.583 --> 35:45.375
Ivanova checked the data files
on your people

35:45.458 --> 35:48.500
and it turns out this
stupid contest of yours

35:48.583 --> 35:50.208
lasts just one cycle.

35:50.292 --> 35:53.333
A Drazi week is six Earth days,
so in four days..

35:53.417 --> 35:55.208
[all laughing]

35:55.292 --> 35:58.375
- What's so funny?
- Cycle not Drazi week.

35:58.458 --> 36:00.417
Cycle is Drazi year.

36:00.500 --> 36:04.750
One Drazi year equal
one point two human years.

36:04.833 --> 36:09.083
Can you keep Purple Drazi
prisoner that long, Earther?

36:09.167 --> 36:12.875
This is our way.
You could do nothing.

36:12.958 --> 36:15.667
But don't you understand,
this is insane!

36:15.750 --> 36:16.917
It doesn't make sense
to go around

36:17.000 --> 36:18.583
killing each other
over a piece of cloth!

36:18.667 --> 36:21.708
You do same, yes, for flag?
For honor?

36:21.792 --> 36:24.583
- That's different. Yes.
- Is it?

36:24.667 --> 36:26.167
Our flags at least
mean something.

36:26.250 --> 36:29.917
It's not as arbitrary
as yanking a color out of a box.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.417
I mean, you're fighting
and dying

36:31.500 --> 36:34.250
over a stupid piece of cloth.

36:34.333 --> 36:36.000
'But there's nothing
special about it.'

36:36.083 --> 36:37.417
It's not patriotic?

36:37.500 --> 36:39.125
It's got nothing
but this stupid little star

36:39.208 --> 36:41.750
'in the middle of it.'

36:41.833 --> 36:43.167
What? What's wrong?

36:43.250 --> 36:46.792
Who takes green is Green,
follows Green leader.

36:46.875 --> 36:49.708
Who takes cloth for Green leader
is Green leader.

36:49.792 --> 36:54.458
- Greens follow Green leader.
- Wait a minute.

36:54.542 --> 36:57.458
You're saying just because
I'm holding this right now

36:57.542 --> 37:01.792
I'm Green leader?
But I'm human.

37:01.875 --> 37:05.792
Rules of combat older
than contact with other races.

37:05.875 --> 37:09.250
Did not mention aliens.
Rules' change.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.958
Caught up in committee.

37:12.042 --> 37:15.083
Not come through yet.

37:15.167 --> 37:18.250
Yeah, bureaucracy,
tell me about it.

37:18.333 --> 37:21.125
Well, what do you know?

37:22.500 --> 37:24.708
Alright.

37:24.792 --> 37:27.333
Greens follow Green leader, huh?

37:28.708 --> 37:30.292
Green leader says,

37:30.375 --> 37:33.333
"You're all coming with us down
to the Quartermaster's office."

37:33.417 --> 37:35.500
I'm sure there'll be some dye
hanging around.

37:35.583 --> 37:37.375
Those of you not spending
the next two months in the brig

37:37.458 --> 37:38.958
for assaulting
an Earth Alliance officer

37:39.042 --> 37:41.917
are gonna look absolutely
gorgeous in purple.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.042
[dramatic music]

37:47.417 --> 37:49.583
Hello?

37:49.667 --> 37:51.750
[indistinct whispering]

37:52.708 --> 37:54.125
Hello?

37:54.208 --> 37:55.833
[clanks]

37:55.917 --> 37:58.958
[intense music]

38:00.292 --> 38:01.667
I admit.

38:01.750 --> 38:06.000
Perhaps my enthusiasm
for, for a personal meeting..

38:06.083 --> 38:08.750
...was excessive.

38:08.833 --> 38:10.917
[growling]

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
A-and certainly, certainly

38:13.083 --> 38:16.167
the, the incident
with the concealed camera

38:16.250 --> 38:18.417
was regrettable.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.833
[roars]

38:20.917 --> 38:23.667
And I would just like
to say that..

38:23.750 --> 38:25.250
...for any misunderstanding

38:25.333 --> 38:28.250
that might have
grown out of all of this

38:28.333 --> 38:29.250
I..

38:29.333 --> 38:30.708
[growling]

38:30.792 --> 38:33.125
...I apologize!

38:40.208 --> 38:42.042
Well..

38:42.125 --> 38:44.583
I'm pleased to see that
you are a sympathetic

38:44.667 --> 38:47.042
and understanding group.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.000
I will go now.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.333
If you ever come this way
again, though..

38:53.417 --> 38:56.458
...perhaps we can do,
do business after all, yes?

39:00.458 --> 39:02.292
Goodbye!

39:04.958 --> 39:08.000
[dramatic music]

39:15.750 --> 39:18.417
(Lou)
'It's really great to see you
back in uniform, chief.'

39:18.500 --> 39:20.042
- Hey!
- Hey!

39:20.125 --> 39:21.292
Welcome back.

39:21.375 --> 39:23.750
[all cheering]

39:23.833 --> 39:25.583
So tell the truth, Garibaldi.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.167
What made you come back to duty?

39:27.250 --> 39:29.375
[sighs]
Well, for a while there
I really didn't know

39:29.458 --> 39:31.000
what I had to offer anymore.

39:31.083 --> 39:32.708
And then I decided
I bring two unique

39:32.792 --> 39:34.458
qualifications to the job.

39:34.542 --> 39:36.750
Number one, as the captain
was kind enough to point out.

39:36.833 --> 39:39.458
I know this place
and everybody on it, intimately.

39:39.542 --> 39:41.208
I-I beg your pardon.

39:41.292 --> 39:43.167
[laughs]
Hey, in the two years
you've been here

39:43.250 --> 39:45.458
you've never been more than
two inches away from your link.

39:45.542 --> 39:46.958
'Knowing that little
piece of information'

39:47.042 --> 39:48.500
'helped save your butt.'

39:48.583 --> 39:50.792
Okay, Garibaldi,
what's reason number two?

39:50.875 --> 39:52.958
I don't trust anybody.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.292
When somebody tells me
we got a message from Ivanova

39:55.375 --> 39:57.500
I don't believe it until
I get it from her point blank.

39:57.583 --> 39:59.625
So in other words,
you're perfect for the job

39:59.708 --> 40:02.333
because you're paranoid
and compulsive.

40:02.417 --> 40:05.792
- Or compulsively paranoid.
- Who told you to say that?

40:05.875 --> 40:08.083
[chuckles]
Sheridan, talk to me.

40:08.167 --> 40:09.750
(man on speaker)
'You said that you wanted to
know when the techno-mages'

40:09.833 --> 40:12.417
'were leaving, captain.
They're boarding now.'

40:12.500 --> 40:14.958
Thank you.
I'll be right there.

40:15.042 --> 40:17.000
I have to head up to Control.

40:17.083 --> 40:19.125
See you in a bit, huh?

40:19.208 --> 40:22.292
- Oh, and, uh, Mr. Garibaldi.
- Michael.

40:22.375 --> 40:24.833
Michael.

40:24.917 --> 40:27.375
I'm glad you agreed to stay on.

40:29.167 --> 40:30.750
(man on speaker)
'Private Liner Crystal Cavern'

40:30.833 --> 40:33.417
'is now in final
jet prior to departure.'

40:33.500 --> 40:36.000
[clears throat]
Excuse me.

40:36.083 --> 40:40.042
I wanted to thank you
for your amusing little gift.

40:40.125 --> 40:43.500
It took me two hours to repair
the damage to my quarters.

40:43.583 --> 40:46.458
And I don't think the smell
will go away for days.

40:46.542 --> 40:51.458
Now if I may ask, does this
torment end when you leave?

40:51.542 --> 40:54.208
Or am I going to have to spend
the rest of my life

40:54.292 --> 40:55.958
paying for one little mistake?

40:56.042 --> 40:59.000
Oh, I'm afraid you're gonna have
to spend the rest of your life

40:59.083 --> 41:00.375
paying for your mistakes.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.750
Not this one, of course,
it's trivial.

41:02.833 --> 41:05.542
I have withdrawn the spell.
But there will be others.

41:05.625 --> 41:07.042
What're you talking about?

41:07.125 --> 41:09.750
You are touched by darkness,
ambassador.

41:09.833 --> 41:13.750
I see it as a blemish
that will grow with time.

41:13.833 --> 41:16.625
I could warn you, of course,
but you would not listen.

41:16.708 --> 41:20.333
I could kill you, but someone
would take your place.

41:20.417 --> 41:22.708
So I do the only thing I can.

41:22.792 --> 41:24.708
I go.

41:24.792 --> 41:28.875
Oh, I believe it was
an endorsement you wanted.

41:28.958 --> 41:32.042
A word or two, a picture,
to send to the folks back home

41:32.125 --> 41:34.792
confirming that you have
a destiny before you.

41:34.875 --> 41:37.667
Yes, it was just a thought,
nothing more.

41:37.750 --> 41:42.417
Well, take this for what little
it will profit you.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.500
As I look at you,
Ambassador Mollari

41:44.583 --> 41:49.583
I see a great hand
reaching out of the stars.

41:49.667 --> 41:51.958
The hand is your hand.

41:52.042 --> 41:53.292
And I hear sounds.

41:53.375 --> 41:57.542
The sounds of billions of people
calling your name.

41:58.333 --> 42:00.542
My followers?

42:00.625 --> 42:02.667
Your victims.

42:06.417 --> 42:07.625
The ship carrying
the techno-mages

42:07.708 --> 42:09.833
is requesting permission
to leave.

42:09.917 --> 42:11.792
What do I tell them?

42:16.875 --> 42:19.125
Tell them..

42:19.208 --> 42:21.125
...permission granted.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.042
[whizzing]

42:31.583 --> 42:33.500
What was it he said?

42:34.917 --> 42:37.667
"Dreamers, shapers,

42:37.750 --> 42:40.667
singers, makers."

42:44.375 --> 42:47.708
Part of me says we'll not see
their like again.

42:50.042 --> 42:53.625
And the part of me
that still believes in magic..

42:55.792 --> 42:58.458
...says don't be so sure.

42:58.542 --> 43:01.583
[instrumental music]

43:07.917 --> 43:10.125
[theme music]
