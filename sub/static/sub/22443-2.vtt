02:33.893 --> 02:36.184
Hey, I thought you were at work.

02:36.851 --> 02:38.952
No, I...

02:39.486 --> 02:42.788
I couldn't sleep. Again. Sorry.

02:43.891 --> 02:45.550
Right, I need these

02:45.566 --> 02:47.136
and these.

02:48.867 --> 02:50.824
I've got a job interview today.

02:51.589 --> 02:52.733
Okay.

02:53.748 --> 02:55.125
What about the kids?

02:56.937 --> 02:59.457
- I'm not trying to pick a fight here.
- Well, you are a bit,

02:59.458 --> 03:02.240
honey, because, as soon as I
mention job, you mention kids.

03:02.277 --> 03:03.389
Right now,

03:03.509 --> 03:07.120
what's the value if it costs us more
than childcare, than what you earn?

03:07.133 --> 03:08.583
There's value for me.

03:09.084 --> 03:10.188
Fair enough.

03:14.657 --> 03:16.342
Sign of a guilty conscience, you know,

03:16.348 --> 03:17.640
insomnia.

03:48.456 --> 03:50.349
_

04:26.162 --> 04:28.440
- He's family!
- Your family!

04:28.560 --> 04:31.196
Your fucking father
would... he'd disapprove...

04:31.240 --> 04:33.602
superiority.

04:35.193 --> 04:38.304
It cannot be your answer
to everything, Gareth.

04:39.806 --> 04:41.791
Look what you made me do.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.943
It's my favourite pot!

04:46.720 --> 04:48.240
You clean that up!

05:50.666 --> 05:52.741
- Morning.
- God, you stink of cigarettes.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.469
Please, please, use the
machine and wash your clothes.

05:56.053 --> 05:58.680
Do me a favour. Would
you round up the kids?

06:05.385 --> 06:07.280
Hey! Shit bags!

06:07.297 --> 06:08.868
School, now.

06:16.740 --> 06:17.888
You're welcome.

06:20.770 --> 06:22.080
Madeleine!

06:22.972 --> 06:26.837
- Honey, I've got a really busy day.
- It can't always be about you, Mom.

06:28.724 --> 06:30.423
I spilt juice on mine.

06:30.443 --> 06:31.968
Fine then, come on please.

06:31.993 --> 06:33.130
Okay I'm coming.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.981
- Where are you going?
- Get out of my room!

06:35.199 --> 06:35.960
Work.

06:36.210 --> 06:39.420
- Familiar with the concept?
- Yeah, heard about it.

06:39.540 --> 06:42.560
- You?
- Got plans.

06:42.634 --> 06:43.134
Hm.

06:46.210 --> 06:47.523
Care to share?

06:49.084 --> 06:50.800
Get money. Depart.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.959
Let's make that happen.

06:53.392 --> 06:56.880
- I need my life back.
- Like the way it was before I got here?

06:56.895 --> 06:58.200
Exactly.

06:59.684 --> 07:03.620
I guess you need your life back to
where it was before the kids were born.

07:03.740 --> 07:07.647
When it was just you and Julie
drinking, smoking, fucking.

07:08.080 --> 07:12.489
Would that make you happier,
if you get that life back?

07:16.088 --> 07:19.038
I haven't had sex in 10 days.

07:19.975 --> 07:21.666
Hey!

07:27.736 --> 07:30.565
- You don't come here.
- Yet, here I am.

07:30.827 --> 07:33.320
- Mr. Clay would like a word.
- I don't give a shit.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.689
This is my home. You don't come here.

07:37.481 --> 07:38.840
Nice house.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.823
It's one of these open
plan jobs downstairs, is it?

07:45.605 --> 07:48.605
Did you excavate the basement, or
was it like that when you bought it?

07:48.614 --> 07:51.182
- Hey, Mr. Mamoud stole my money.
- Wait! Wait!

07:51.184 --> 07:53.014
- You got balls coming up here, man.
- Wait!

07:53.040 --> 07:55.287
We'll meet you on the other
side of the bridge, all right?

07:59.687 --> 08:01.116
I'll get my coat.

08:22.296 --> 08:24.058
Let me do the talking, all right?

08:47.755 --> 08:52.647
Mr. Clay, I'm very grateful for
the opportunity to talk to you.

08:54.251 --> 08:57.221
If I've offended you
in any way, Mr. Clay...

08:59.057 --> 09:01.000
No offence taken.

09:03.567 --> 09:04.830
Nelson Clay.

09:05.036 --> 09:07.839
Jean Bastière. This is my brother, Martin.

09:10.545 --> 09:12.072
I have to say,

09:12.827 --> 09:15.049
I was reluctant to take this meeting.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.593
I have enough friends as it
is. I don't need any new ones.

09:18.999 --> 09:20.681
The boys insisted.

09:21.222 --> 09:24.527
Frank here in particular seems
to think you did something

09:24.959 --> 09:28.129
- remarkable the other night.
- I did.

09:30.024 --> 09:30.984
Mr. Clay...

09:32.169 --> 09:33.200
Frank! Joey!

09:40.809 --> 09:42.400
Don't raise your fists near me.

09:42.461 --> 09:43.840
And you don't touch my brother.

09:43.878 --> 09:45.798
You nearly got two of my men killed

09:45.805 --> 09:47.878
and they displayed the rare sensitivity

09:47.883 --> 09:50.680
of not putting a bullet
through your fucking temple.

09:50.707 --> 09:51.880
Now if I were you,

09:52.080 --> 09:53.214
I'd call it even.

09:55.198 --> 09:57.067
There's been a misunderstanding.

10:00.514 --> 10:02.305
This doesn't belong to us.

10:03.516 --> 10:06.197
We're not criminal
people. It's not our thing.

10:09.605 --> 10:10.778
What is this?

10:12.711 --> 10:13.990
He doesn't know?

10:15.082 --> 10:18.567
That is £20,000 I've given
to your brother in payment.

10:18.993 --> 10:19.766
What?

10:20.346 --> 10:23.280
- Why didn't you tell me about this?
- It's his money.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.874
A retainer for future services.

10:26.087 --> 10:28.368
- There won't be any future services...
- You...

10:29.122 --> 10:30.655
I know a lot about.

10:31.022 --> 10:33.116
Your family, your home,

10:33.328 --> 10:34.800
your cleaning business,

10:35.229 --> 10:36.885
your bank balance.

10:37.581 --> 10:39.565
It's a terrible thing that recession.

10:39.890 --> 10:43.640
All about the greed of a...
Get out of my fucking sight!

10:46.400 --> 10:47.641
What've we got on him?

10:48.553 --> 10:49.680
Absolutely nothing.

10:50.558 --> 10:51.306
Good.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.954
You bring drugs from France
inside that dead girl?

10:54.629 --> 10:55.485
Yes, I did.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.186
Despite all your financial problems,

11:02.923 --> 11:06.382
you still don't want to profit from the
situation, even though the work's complete?

11:09.103 --> 11:10.334
That interests me.

11:10.454 --> 11:12.056
He's got his own moral compass.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.800
It's like The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.081
James Stewart, 1959.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.613
Anyways, it's my choice.

11:21.386 --> 11:25.211
I decided long ago, my life
would be my choice, no one else's.

11:25.240 --> 11:27.531
Everybody's got a sad story, son.

11:28.495 --> 11:30.015
I'm not everybody.

11:34.742 --> 11:35.618
Okay.

11:36.092 --> 11:37.010
I accept.

11:37.643 --> 11:38.979
I'm sorry, you accept what?

11:38.980 --> 11:40.648
- What's going on?
- Your brother makes a good case.

11:40.649 --> 11:43.628
I accept his refusal to
get involved in my business.

11:44.407 --> 11:45.840
You're free to go.

11:50.951 --> 11:52.148
Thank you.

11:52.731 --> 11:54.360
Let's go!

11:56.412 --> 11:59.297
- 62, not 59.
- Huh?

11:59.592 --> 12:00.872
Liberty Valance.

12:00.891 --> 12:03.864
John Ford for Paramount, 1962.

12:04.711 --> 12:05.991
Muppet.

12:07.378 --> 12:11.168
See? Treat people with
respect, they respond to it.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.400
Yeah, right. You just signed
your own death warrant.

12:14.520 --> 12:15.235
A guy like that

12:15.261 --> 12:17.406
- just doesn't let people walk away.
- Oh, stop it!

12:17.501 --> 12:19.763
Enough with the bad guy bullshit.

12:19.883 --> 12:21.358
I fixed it.

12:22.165 --> 12:24.252
Listen, we're gonna go to my office,

12:24.372 --> 12:27.207
I'll get what money I can for
you. It's not gonna be much.

12:27.211 --> 12:28.915
But it's gonna be something.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.110
And that's it.

12:31.444 --> 12:33.690
- You understand?
- Sure.

12:44.155 --> 12:46.055
- Hey.
- How's it going?

12:46.064 --> 12:49.960
Almost ready. Shitting
myself truth be told.

12:49.992 --> 12:52.384
A bit of adrenaline will
do you a world of good.

12:52.504 --> 12:55.672
- What are you wearing?
- Uh, just deciding.

12:55.711 --> 12:57.110
Think...

12:57.474 --> 12:58.098
Mmm...

12:58.103 --> 13:00.503
promise of sex rather than sex itself.

13:00.505 --> 13:02.829
- Tits, out or in?
- They'll be in I'd say.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.680
You're fucking brilliant,
sis. Don't forget it.

13:05.698 --> 13:07.200
Thanks, Nina.

13:21.951 --> 13:23.230
There you go.

13:23.634 --> 13:26.360
£1300. That's everything.

13:29.245 --> 13:31.243
Feel free to say "thank you" any time.

13:32.887 --> 13:34.256
Fuck you.

13:34.551 --> 13:36.853
You had 20 grand for 4 days.

13:36.973 --> 13:39.280
- It was dirty money.
- No, it was my money.

13:39.296 --> 13:42.030
And again, it was not your
fucking decision to make!

13:42.656 --> 13:44.031
- You just...
- Yeah, yeah, do your thing.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.100
Whatever you do.

13:47.151 --> 13:49.396
- Hello?
- It's Tom Kendrick.

13:49.435 --> 13:50.663
Oh, you changed number?

13:50.693 --> 13:53.478
I need to see you now. Waterside
Inn, Hammersmith, 30 minutes.

13:53.488 --> 13:55.360
Of course, I'll be there.

14:25.827 --> 14:27.293
So, we're done now?

14:31.645 --> 14:33.121
Don't come back.

14:33.241 --> 14:35.041
I don't need you here.

14:38.289 --> 14:41.341
I have a thing, but, not for a van.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.778
Can I take your car?

14:42.818 --> 14:44.314
Yeah.

14:47.946 --> 14:49.176
Thank you.

14:51.696 --> 14:53.153
Who was the guy?

14:53.419 --> 14:55.870
Oh, boss' brother.

14:55.909 --> 14:57.731
Think he's getting out of Dodge.

14:57.967 --> 14:59.808
He watched me dressing.

15:01.019 --> 15:02.673
You're kiddin' me!

15:35.500 --> 15:38.508
As long as we're together,
nothing can happen.

15:38.575 --> 15:40.875
No one will know.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.963
- Hello?
- Where are you?

15:52.973 --> 15:55.887
- Yeah, I'm right in front of the pub.
- I'm under the bridge.

15:55.917 --> 15:58.132
- What?
- Under the bridge!

16:06.087 --> 16:07.967
What's going on, Tom?

16:08.174 --> 16:10.040
I'm under investigation.

16:10.044 --> 16:11.440
What?

16:12.416 --> 16:15.520
I've been suspended.
I'm under investigation,

16:15.547 --> 16:17.604
soliciting and accepting payments,

16:17.636 --> 16:20.036
in return for the award of contracts.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.480
Bribery.

16:22.181 --> 16:25.007
- Do they have anything?
- They have a lot.

16:25.548 --> 16:26.335
Okay.

16:26.956 --> 16:28.960
What can I do?

16:28.988 --> 16:32.936
Wipe any paper or electronic records
you ever make, called or emailed me.

16:33.062 --> 16:36.072
- Of course.
- Don't just say "of course". Think.

16:36.407 --> 16:39.528
Phone, computer, little pocket diaries...

16:41.113 --> 16:42.960
And I need money.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.680
Sorry?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.285
I've got two options:

16:47.405 --> 16:50.880
run or hire the best lawyers in London.

16:50.897 --> 16:53.120
Either way, I... I need money.

16:53.643 --> 16:56.202
Listen, Tom, I gave you
everything I could over the years.

16:56.212 --> 16:57.728
I really don't have anything.

16:59.010 --> 17:00.297
If it wasn't for me

17:00.337 --> 17:03.400
you'd still be serving
croissants and coffee some place.

17:05.751 --> 17:07.877
I'm very grateful.

17:10.416 --> 17:12.651
I know a lot of stuff, John.

17:13.941 --> 17:15.723
Damaging information

17:15.843 --> 17:17.396
I don't get what I need,

17:17.516 --> 17:20.251
you're little bilingual
kids and your pretty wife

17:20.371 --> 17:23.500
have got two decades of
prison visits ahead of them.

17:26.207 --> 17:28.530
I don't have any money for you.

17:31.850 --> 17:32.980
Fuck!

17:33.908 --> 17:35.840
Jesus Christ!

17:39.411 --> 17:41.840
If you weren't a cop, I'd
kick your fucking ass for this.

17:41.850 --> 17:43.160
I'm in a corner.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.760
So you hit me?

17:44.880 --> 17:47.050
I want 5 grand, John. Get it.

17:47.365 --> 17:49.590
Or I'll fucking sink you.

17:56.126 --> 17:56.932
Fuck!

18:01.098 --> 18:02.624
Perfect.

18:33.003 --> 18:36.438
- It's bold, isn't it?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

18:36.439 --> 18:38.496
Do you know he was still in
college when he made this?

18:38.979 --> 18:40.121
It's impressive.

18:40.278 --> 18:40.860
Mm.

18:41.027 --> 18:43.025
Are you interested in
this piece in particular?

18:43.045 --> 18:44.688
- Or is there something else I can show...
- Oh, no, sorry,

18:44.689 --> 18:45.975
no, I'm not... I'm not a buyer.

18:45.995 --> 18:48.879
- I'm... I'm... ah, here for the interview.
- Oh.

18:49.775 --> 18:52.931
It's through the door at
the back, into the offices.

19:39.223 --> 19:40.867
It was mortifying.

19:41.320 --> 19:45.493
You know, when I walked in, they went
quiet, like the matron had arrived.

19:45.613 --> 19:47.680
Not one of them was a day over 20.

19:47.712 --> 19:49.854
Especially since you're
such an old hag these days.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.018
Oh shut up, you know what I mean.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.188
Actually, I don't.

19:52.195 --> 19:55.120
Wouldn't put myself in that
situation, can't fathom why you did.

19:55.163 --> 19:56.519
Because it's time.

19:56.834 --> 19:59.160
Because the kids are old enough
that I should be out there.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.493
And you know I don't want
them growing up thinking that

20:01.539 --> 20:02.981
my ambition only ever extended

20:03.000 --> 20:06.068
as far as symmetrical
towels and home-made sauces.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.310
Oh, thank fuck for that.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.400
I'm sorry?

20:08.423 --> 20:10.442
I thought you'd had a
lobotomy and forgot to say.

20:10.465 --> 20:14.885
I've been waiting half a decade
for you to get off your ass.

20:14.924 --> 20:17.413
I couldn't bear watching
you at home making fucking

20:17.414 --> 20:19.480
muffins from leftovers.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.840
Do you know If I was a man, I would
knock your teeth out for saying that.

20:21.847 --> 20:24.200
No, if you were a man, you
wouldn't be stuck at home

20:24.210 --> 20:27.842
locked in the eternal search for
the perfect fabric conditioner.

20:27.862 --> 20:28.964
What I don't get

20:29.000 --> 20:32.375
is why you're applying for shitty
entry-level jobs in the first place.

20:33.103 --> 20:34.950
Well, there aren't a lot
of options for people...

20:34.951 --> 20:36.439
An old peg like you.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.200
So set up on your own.

20:38.675 --> 20:40.947
- Yeah, right.
- Well, why not?

20:41.067 --> 20:43.520
What's the point in baby steps?

20:43.537 --> 20:45.680
Life's for fucking living.

20:45.930 --> 20:48.280
Drag your tools out of storage,

20:48.400 --> 20:50.670
and make wonderful things.

20:50.678 --> 20:52.836
We don't have the space, and...

20:53.042 --> 20:54.705
money's actually tighter than you think...

20:54.706 --> 20:56.080
Oh, stop finding obstacles.

20:56.110 --> 20:57.916
I'll front you set up costs for a workshop.

20:57.997 --> 20:59.640
Nina, I can't let you do that.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.755
I don't have time for fucking
niceties. I'm in court in 20 minutes.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.320
Are you up for it or not?

21:07.904 --> 21:09.932
- Hey, it's me.
- Hiya.

21:10.650 --> 21:11.930
How are you doing?

21:12.050 --> 21:13.320
I'm good.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.263
Are you okay?

21:17.992 --> 21:19.144
Yeah.

21:20.561 --> 21:22.766
Why did you phone for, Jean?

21:23.564 --> 21:25.000
I'm not sure.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.787
We could eat something. My treat.

21:27.807 --> 21:29.156
Sure.

21:30.239 --> 21:31.814
Then fuck.

21:33.911 --> 21:35.427
I would like that.

22:15.463 --> 22:17.648
"I'm not everybody", you said.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.296
I think you might be right.

22:21.241 --> 22:23.000
But you said we were free to go.

22:23.013 --> 22:24.371
Changed my mind.

22:24.730 --> 22:26.586
I want to see what you're capable of.

22:31.232 --> 22:33.417
- No.
- "No" isn't an option.

22:34.451 --> 22:35.400
Urgh!

22:35.444 --> 22:36.724
Fuck!

22:37.028 --> 22:37.706
Urgh!

22:37.738 --> 22:38.850
You all right?

22:39.156 --> 22:42.307
I'd rather we didn't have to
hit you, to get your agreement.

22:43.104 --> 22:44.600
It's up to you, really.

22:52.117 --> 22:54.198
A year ago we had you make the decisions.

22:54.254 --> 22:57.403
So, what? You've got more money.

22:57.404 --> 23:00.193
It's all about money. That's
what we're fucking talking about.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.211
- You've changed your tune.
- No I haven't.

23:02.212 --> 23:05.149
It's been exactly the fucking
same tune since we met!

23:05.282 --> 23:07.774
The only difference is
Daddy's not there to bail his

23:07.800 --> 23:10.125
little princess out if
you're out of fucking money!

23:10.160 --> 23:12.970
And every penny I've got, I made myself!

23:13.000 --> 23:17.111
What happened to "What's mine is
yours". It's all bullshit for me.

23:17.112 --> 23:18.518
Gave your crumbs off the table.

23:18.519 --> 23:22.104
- And I'm supposed to be grateful for it?
- Dad touched you! You used it...

23:22.105 --> 23:25.040
And I'll never hear the fucking
end of it. It's blackmail!

23:25.160 --> 23:27.177
I'll pay for your further...

23:27.178 --> 23:29.260
- then I'll... for the rest of my life...
- Hello?

23:29.290 --> 23:30.902
- Hello?
- Well, he can fuck off!

23:30.903 --> 23:32.971
It's not all about the
grubby little money...

23:33.062 --> 23:35.070
We got more going out than coming in.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.318
What the fuck is wrong with you?

23:36.319 --> 23:38.863
It's not always about money, Gareth.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.791
This neighbourhood,
these clothes, this house,

23:40.792 --> 23:43.320
- it's always about the money!
- Hey! Oh!

23:43.328 --> 23:44.617
What are you doing?

23:44.863 --> 23:48.171
I don't know if you guys realise, but
we... we can here all this from the street.

23:49.214 --> 23:50.622
What are you arguing about anyway?

23:50.640 --> 23:52.453
My father needs 24 hour nursing care

23:52.483 --> 23:55.170
and my husband doesn't
want us to pay for it.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.692
We all have a dad, mate.

23:56.722 --> 23:59.232
That's what we pay our taxes for.

23:59.734 --> 24:01.635
In a perfect world.

24:01.861 --> 24:03.670
But we can't all live in Sweden.

24:03.672 --> 24:05.742
What? Where's Rooney?

24:05.749 --> 24:07.760
- Who's Rooney?
- My dog!

24:07.880 --> 24:10.345
- He's in the other room.
- He doesn't like closed doors! I..

24:10.365 --> 24:13.377
And I don't like barking,
so stay where you are!

24:13.497 --> 24:16.813
- That's assault.
- That's assault? No, mate.

24:17.129 --> 24:17.629
Urgh!

24:17.669 --> 24:20.809
- This, is assault.
- Oh, God, oh!

24:21.338 --> 24:22.719
Ah, ah, ah...

24:22.975 --> 24:24.373
God!

24:24.398 --> 24:25.419
Urgh!

24:27.365 --> 24:30.619
I'll have the fucking police
on you. That's my home!

24:31.127 --> 24:34.280
The lady of the house invited me in.

24:53.502 --> 24:56.051
My father always thought Gareth was a dick.

24:57.124 --> 24:59.093
This is Gareth's revenge.

24:59.762 --> 25:00.914
Well,

25:01.357 --> 25:03.480
this is none of my business.

25:04.950 --> 25:07.190
There was just too much shouting.

25:09.922 --> 25:11.200
Thank you.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.242
Thank you.

25:23.270 --> 25:24.579
It's okay.

25:26.415 --> 25:27.961
It's okay.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.360
What?

25:38.376 --> 25:40.360
- I'm in trouble.
- Good.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.107
I need your help.

25:42.441 --> 25:44.981
They killed a guy, and
they want me to clean it.

25:45.936 --> 25:48.240
They kidnapped me, put a bag over my head.

25:48.643 --> 25:51.960
Well, maybe they'll cut little bits off
you and send it in the mail for ransom.

25:53.730 --> 25:55.199
Don't be a dick.

25:55.918 --> 25:57.965
Tell me again how much you need me.

25:58.259 --> 25:59.509
Please.

26:05.090 --> 26:06.558
I gotta go.

26:22.407 --> 26:24.612
Hey, guys! Guys!

26:24.732 --> 26:26.148
Hey!

26:26.443 --> 26:27.759
You're skaters, uh?

26:27.784 --> 26:28.358
Yeah.

26:28.359 --> 26:29.861
- I used to skate.
- Oh yeah?

26:29.862 --> 26:32.080
Yeah, yeah. It's a nice
board. Can I see it?

26:32.220 --> 26:35.458
- Ah... sure.
- Come on, come on. It's a longboard.

26:35.459 --> 26:38.474
- Yeah
- Indie Trucks. Can I try?

26:38.475 --> 26:39.280
Sure.

26:39.281 --> 26:41.520
Just a... Just a little, just a little.

26:41.545 --> 26:43.058
Thanks mate. Ciao!

26:43.059 --> 26:45.514
- Hey...
- Get off my board you fat bastard!

26:45.515 --> 26:47.288
What the hell, man?

26:54.993 --> 26:57.582
It's a parking ticket, from London.

26:58.084 --> 26:59.880
£450.

27:02.494 --> 27:04.400
He's in London.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.071
We found him.

27:31.100 --> 27:33.631
My brother is asking
you to give me the keys

27:33.640 --> 27:36.446
to the mini-bus without the
company logo on it. Right now.

27:36.566 --> 27:38.422
Do I appear stupid to you?

27:38.491 --> 27:43.269
No... no. And he... he said you
would say that. And I should tell you,

27:43.298 --> 27:46.213
that the padlock code for petty cash,

27:46.240 --> 27:47.860
is 2-5-75.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.720
David Beckham's date of birth.

27:49.740 --> 27:51.286
You like Beckham?

27:51.316 --> 27:53.167
I'm only fucking human.

27:55.185 --> 27:58.837
And now, I'm gonna change
the code to the petty cash.

28:00.393 --> 28:04.015
- I like your tattoo.
- Thank you. I like your board.

28:06.024 --> 28:07.678
I didn't know you had a tattoo?

28:07.698 --> 28:10.680
Yeah. Tit tat', just here.

28:11.157 --> 28:12.073
Whoa!

28:22.395 --> 28:23.840
What are you doing?

28:23.960 --> 28:25.160
I...

28:25.800 --> 28:28.212
- am starting a business.
- Doing what?

28:28.221 --> 28:29.294
Demolition?

28:30.574 --> 28:32.336
No, darling.

28:32.582 --> 28:35.720
Making beautiful, beautiful things.

28:35.742 --> 28:37.681
You've been with Aunt Nina.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.480
Yes, I have.

29:00.126 --> 29:01.520
Sorry.

29:02.065 --> 29:03.620
You were right.

29:12.303 --> 29:14.040
Show me.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.000
That's grim.

29:23.664 --> 29:25.280
All right, let's go.

29:46.541 --> 29:48.400
He's thorough.

29:49.494 --> 29:50.685
Yep.

29:51.272 --> 29:53.720
Ever since he was a little kid.

30:03.420 --> 30:05.852
Well, he's made himself
interesting to my brother.

30:06.836 --> 30:09.031
And now he has to stay interesting.

30:10.144 --> 30:11.800
Or what?

30:36.004 --> 30:37.680
- You're his brother?
- Mm.

30:38.022 --> 30:39.351
Victor.

30:39.558 --> 30:41.120
Victor Clay.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.840
I'm Martin.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.440
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

31:10.616 --> 31:12.004
Done?

31:12.417 --> 31:15.000
We need to roll the
vehicle inside the stable.

31:26.011 --> 31:28.147
- Easy tiger.
- Frank, buck up.

32:02.248 --> 32:03.751
What's that?

32:03.754 --> 32:06.280
Blood. Fingerprint.

32:14.928 --> 32:16.600
That was impressive.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.456
I planted the last print myself.

32:19.495 --> 32:20.979
Put on a show.

32:21.206 --> 32:22.668
Will they kill us?

32:22.702 --> 32:24.376
Would you kill Houdini?

32:26.689 --> 32:29.602
- I was out of line earlier today.
- Shut up.

32:31.049 --> 32:32.674
- You happy?
- Yeah.

32:32.910 --> 32:35.065
Well, that's the last time I dance for you.

32:35.685 --> 32:38.200
The scene was phony. A set-up.

32:38.225 --> 32:40.991
- Animal blood spread deliberately.
- How did you know?

32:41.217 --> 32:43.727
Well, you'd have to kill 10
men to get that much blood.

32:43.954 --> 32:46.474
The spatter patterns were non-existent.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.513
Was it pig? Goat?

32:48.533 --> 32:51.362
Yeah, I've... um, I've got a
friend who's halal butcher was um,

32:51.375 --> 32:53.485
20 quid for a couple of
pounds of left overs, yeah.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.054
- Thought it was kosher?
- Why would a Muslim be kosher?

32:56.080 --> 32:58.296
- What's the difference?
- It's the... um...

32:58.416 --> 33:00.256
- the method of slaughter I think...
- Frank.

33:00.482 --> 33:02.000
Well, let's wrap it up.

33:02.033 --> 33:04.087
If we're gonna work together...

33:05.258 --> 33:07.242
it's better you do it by choice.

33:08.717 --> 33:10.034
This is my home.

33:10.834 --> 33:13.026
Come and have a drink, please.

33:14.210 --> 33:15.590
Get changed.

33:20.115 --> 33:22.005
Put yourself in my shoes.

33:22.717 --> 33:24.462
Had I not met you earlier,

33:24.884 --> 33:27.177
my business would have
carried on as normal.

33:27.751 --> 33:30.945
Now I can't see how I can
let such a unique resource,

33:30.960 --> 33:32.760
slip through my fingers.

33:34.096 --> 33:35.677
I'm not the guy you think I am.

33:35.757 --> 33:39.181
I think you are. Just don't
think you recognise it yet.

33:39.659 --> 33:41.675
These are difficult times, Jean.

33:42.040 --> 33:43.773
The economy, it's a lie.

33:44.044 --> 33:45.411
Government's a lie.

33:45.922 --> 33:48.851
Health, education, housing,

33:49.601 --> 33:53.000
wars, invasions, credit
raising interest rates...

33:53.240 --> 33:58.000
all lies founded on a
kinda... mass hysteria.

33:58.780 --> 34:01.471
What are you? Like a... an anarchist?

34:01.805 --> 34:03.191
You don't look like one.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.965
Society never did me any
good. My upbringing...

34:06.996 --> 34:08.426
my background,

34:08.545 --> 34:11.501
I'm supposed to have a dull shit life.

34:12.118 --> 34:14.121
But I don't accept my role,

34:14.159 --> 34:17.228
my allocated role in society.

34:17.616 --> 34:19.123
You don't accept your role?

34:19.243 --> 34:21.092
I don't accept society.

34:22.755 --> 34:24.725
Your brother's a philosopher.

34:25.867 --> 34:27.239
Yeah, he reads.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.040
- Reading is good.
- Yeah.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.107
Charles Darwin.

34:31.452 --> 34:34.040
Origin of the species,
evolution, that sort of stuff.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.900
- Oh, the origins.
- Yeah.

34:35.918 --> 34:37.210
Ah, I know that.

34:37.487 --> 34:39.040
Evolution.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.362
You know Tom?

34:48.495 --> 34:51.181
He's a friend of mine. Good man,

34:51.202 --> 34:54.600
but he's in trouble. Some people
are trying to make an example of him.

34:54.904 --> 34:57.493
You should know that I
look after my friends.

34:57.613 --> 35:00.574
We're gonna help him out.
Give him what he needs.

35:05.575 --> 35:08.351
Keep it charged, and keep it on.

35:08.627 --> 35:11.480
I need to contact you
any time, day or night.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.400
I have some conditions.

35:21.463 --> 35:23.894
When you call on me to do a job,

35:24.495 --> 35:26.040
it's my scene,

35:26.385 --> 35:28.040
I'm in charge on the ground.

35:28.058 --> 35:30.000
- Nobody else.
- Fair enough.

35:31.337 --> 35:33.177
I don't like an audience.

35:33.394 --> 35:34.930
Your guys can't be there.

35:35.796 --> 35:37.863
You can't be left on your own.

35:38.256 --> 35:40.835
For your own protection, as well as mine.

35:41.160 --> 35:45.350
Now, one of my men will stand guard. He
won't interfere, he won't get in your way.

35:45.955 --> 35:47.440
Fair enough.

35:49.175 --> 35:50.868
My brother's my partner.

35:52.404 --> 35:53.673
Okay.

35:55.140 --> 35:56.400
I didn't know that.

35:56.656 --> 35:58.400
Well, now you know.

36:00.122 --> 36:01.658
I'm gonna go.

36:16.168 --> 36:18.318
I haven't got the measure
of your brother, yet.

36:19.072 --> 36:21.690
He's the kind of guys
that can still surprise.

36:23.718 --> 36:25.323
One last thing:

36:28.886 --> 36:32.242
I don't wanna be there
when any crime is committed.

36:33.079 --> 36:34.940
I don't wanna know why,

36:35.668 --> 36:37.843
I don't wanna be any part of that.

36:46.751 --> 36:48.750
I think this belongs to you.

37:18.086 --> 37:19.671
Oh... huh!

37:20.045 --> 37:21.360
Make yourself at home.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.502
I'm sorry. I didn't see
you, I didn't mean to...

37:23.560 --> 37:25.405
Don't be sorry. It's what it's there for.

37:27.610 --> 37:28.605
Sonny,

37:28.832 --> 37:30.061
boss' wife.

37:30.086 --> 37:31.226
Hi, uh...

37:31.346 --> 37:33.922
I'm Martin. I'm here with my brother.

37:34.130 --> 37:35.882
We might work with your husband.

37:36.745 --> 37:37.920
In France?

37:38.040 --> 37:39.354
No, here.

37:42.264 --> 37:44.287
You just... you be honest with
him and you'll be all right.

37:45.585 --> 37:47.550
I'm always honest, I never lie.

37:48.950 --> 37:50.240
You never lie?

37:50.285 --> 37:51.085
No.

37:52.433 --> 37:55.476
I'm not sure I should trust
someone who never lies.

37:56.465 --> 37:57.826
You can trust me.

37:59.678 --> 38:00.515
May I?

38:00.837 --> 38:02.480
Of course. Be my guest.

38:08.460 --> 38:11.144
- It's really good. You cook?
- I do, I love to cook, yeah.

38:11.194 --> 38:12.826
- Well...
- I'm glad you like it.

38:13.783 --> 38:14.879
Nice to meet you.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.007
Don't even think about it.

38:21.444 --> 38:23.069
I always think about it.

38:24.033 --> 38:26.567
Guys, I got a great deal for you.

38:29.950 --> 38:33.239
Six wraps of heroin

38:33.472 --> 38:35.897
worth 16 000 quid.

38:36.017 --> 38:38.760
And I make it for 8000, right now.

38:38.890 --> 38:40.018
Where'd you get it from?

38:40.837 --> 38:42.613
You stole if from the last lot.

38:42.835 --> 38:44.082
No, I didn't.

38:44.107 --> 38:45.310
It's not the same colour.

38:46.230 --> 38:47.780
- Uh.
- Hmm...

38:48.549 --> 38:50.521
You said 6 wraps, there's only 5 there.

38:51.895 --> 38:53.904
Look... look deeper, genius.

38:54.647 --> 38:57.790
Une, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.

38:58.239 --> 38:59.347
Five.

39:06.130 --> 39:07.241
I'll be right back.

39:14.537 --> 39:15.715
We need to go.

39:16.075 --> 39:18.120
- Okay. I...
- Now.

39:19.969 --> 39:21.059
You're free to go.

39:21.370 --> 39:22.319
Are you sure?

39:30.510 --> 39:31.720
Give me the keys to the Fiat.

39:31.928 --> 39:34.354
- Well, it's Maureen's car.
- I don't care. Give me the keys.

39:43.653 --> 39:45.688
1 missed call

39:46.481 --> 39:49.171
You have one new message.

39:49.650 --> 39:50.966
Hey, it's Claire.

39:51.363 --> 39:53.125
Haven't heard from you, so...

39:53.144 --> 39:54.356
guess something came up.

39:54.885 --> 39:56.034
I miss you.

39:56.447 --> 39:57.641
Make it soon.

40:07.732 --> 40:09.995
Not so tough now, are you, eh?

40:10.897 --> 40:12.646
Shut up. Get out of my face,

40:12.766 --> 40:14.949
or I'll fuck your dog, and your wife.

40:14.989 --> 40:15.952
Rooney.

40:16.628 --> 40:18.236
Rooney! Rooney!

40:18.520 --> 40:19.359
Rooney!

40:22.792 --> 40:23.634
Maddy.

40:25.726 --> 40:26.608
Maddy.

40:27.380 --> 40:30.283
Something really important
has gone missing from my room.

40:30.920 --> 40:31.720
What is it?

40:32.078 --> 40:35.112
It's medicine, I get from
France. I re... I really need it.

40:35.455 --> 40:36.997
I haven't been in your room.

40:37.605 --> 40:38.669
Are you sure?

40:40.125 --> 40:41.816
You haven't gone through my books?

40:43.631 --> 40:44.896
I only borrowed it.

40:46.922 --> 40:49.261
It's okay. You can have it.
Read it, you're old enough.

40:49.976 --> 40:51.257
What about the other thing?

40:53.742 --> 40:56.912
- It looked like drugs.
- I would never do drugs.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.382
It's medicine, I need it.

40:59.448 --> 41:01.348
- Where is it?
- I flushed it down the toilet.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.893
Maddy, this stuff can kill you.

41:04.095 --> 41:04.997
Where is it?

41:05.040 --> 41:06.696
I flushed it down the toilet.

41:30.389 --> 41:31.972
Are you gonna tell my mom and dad?

41:35.308 --> 41:36.125
No.

41:46.342 --> 41:49.125
But you've gotta promise me never
to go through my stuff again.

41:49.573 --> 41:50.465
Yeah.

41:51.402 --> 41:52.465
It's very important.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.811
I promise.

41:57.360 --> 41:58.343
Come here.

42:23.639 --> 42:24.612
May I?

42:30.327 --> 42:31.300
Thanks.

42:41.546 --> 42:42.670
What's going on?

42:44.515 --> 42:46.007
Rooney died.

42:47.664 --> 42:48.763
The dog.

42:49.083 --> 42:49.820
Oh.

42:50.881 --> 42:53.008
Had an epileptic fit or something,

42:53.573 --> 42:54.626
seizure.

42:55.332 --> 42:56.864
He was foaming at the mouth.

42:58.361 --> 43:02.385
Gareth is beside himself.

43:04.460 --> 43:07.454
It seems, my husband and the dog

43:07.574 --> 43:09.394
were soul mates.

43:12.668 --> 43:13.760
Soul mates?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.476
It's not being a good day.

43:15.723 --> 43:16.786
Me neither.

43:59.660 --> 44:00.497
Dad,

44:00.961 --> 44:03.030
why can't we go and see Grandma?

44:04.987 --> 44:06.323
She's not dead, is she?

44:06.625 --> 44:08.621
No, no, she's not dead.

44:10.234 --> 44:13.122
So, is Granddad really dead?

44:17.400 --> 44:18.560
Uh, yeah.

44:19.568 --> 44:21.669
My mom is in a hospital in France.

44:21.895 --> 44:23.832
And you know my dad is dead.

44:24.981 --> 44:26.347
How did he die?

44:27.198 --> 44:28.523
And honestly.

44:31.120 --> 44:34.720
He went out on his fishing boat,

44:35.480 --> 44:36.985
and he got caught in a storm.

44:38.335 --> 44:40.180
And his boat crashed

44:40.473 --> 44:43.160
against the rocks, near La Rochelle.

44:43.619 --> 44:44.949
Scary enough for you?

44:45.181 --> 44:46.708
I thought you said he was a farmer.

44:47.116 --> 44:50.346
Yeah, mussels and oysters farming.

44:51.288 --> 44:53.808
You know, you two could help now and then.

44:54.182 --> 44:56.173
Mom and I shouldn't have to do it all.

44:56.359 --> 45:00.099
Tell us again, about how you didn't have
a washing machine when you were a kid.

45:00.261 --> 45:01.784
Uh, we did have a washing machine.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.744
It just... it was always broken.

45:06.179 --> 45:07.710
You know, you two are spoiled.

45:08.387 --> 45:09.722
"You two are spoiled."

45:11.209 --> 45:12.873
Oh, you think that's clever?

45:13.971 --> 45:15.191
Mimicking people?

45:15.262 --> 45:16.123
Hmm?

45:19.969 --> 45:22.883
Well, maybe... maybe
you think that's clever.

45:28.096 --> 45:29.670
You think that's funny, uh?

45:29.729 --> 45:30.465
Right?

45:30.584 --> 45:31.334
Huh?

45:37.008 --> 45:37.865
Oh!

46:11.164 --> 46:12.847
I had my job interview today.

46:13.427 --> 46:14.425
How was it?

46:14.801 --> 46:17.454
Oh, spectacularly shit.

46:17.882 --> 46:20.357
- Well, fuck them.
- That's what I think.

46:21.496 --> 46:22.504
So,

46:23.098 --> 46:24.631
I'm gonna set up on my own.

46:25.170 --> 46:26.783
Open up my own workshop.

46:27.192 --> 46:28.694
Nina's gonna front me the money,

46:28.709 --> 46:31.133
and I've already been looking at locations,

46:31.380 --> 46:32.620
thinking about designs.

46:33.733 --> 46:35.040
Oh, that's great.

46:36.491 --> 46:37.464
She says that

46:37.711 --> 46:40.095
we can pay her back whenever we can.

46:40.215 --> 46:41.678
There's no rush.

46:41.798 --> 46:43.480
Oh, that's cool.

46:47.283 --> 46:49.543
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

46:50.944 --> 46:53.921
Yeah, I've had, a kinda

46:53.953 --> 46:56.087
weird day myself.

46:59.631 --> 47:01.474
Life is for living.

48:06.256 --> 48:07.611
H... hello?

48:11.825 --> 48:13.258
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

48:15.322 --> 48:16.668
Is it a job?

48:18.346 --> 48:19.748
Yeah, a job.

48:20.858 --> 48:22.160
Go back to sleep.

48:28.456 --> 48:28.956
Hey...

48:29.663 --> 48:31.200
I need your help.

48:33.280 --> 48:34.520
Again?

48:54.176 --> 48:56.885
I don't like this. Where the fuck are we?

49:26.945 --> 49:28.307
Wait, wait.

49:44.523 --> 49:45.885
Follow me.

49:59.676 --> 50:01.669
I believe you know

50:02.330 --> 50:04.760
DCI Tom Kendrick.
