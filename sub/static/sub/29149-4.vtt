12:01.792 --> 12:03.916
Can we not get a water
cannon down there?

12:03.917 --> 12:05.582
You know, give 'em a fucking shower,

12:05.583 --> 12:06.916
fucking animals.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.707
The police have it
under control, I believe.

12:08.708 --> 12:12.332
Well, yeah, but I don't think
it's smart to sugar-coat it.

12:12.333 --> 12:15.248
To me, "ATN under siege".

12:15.249 --> 12:18.123
- That's our line.
- Agreed. Endorsed.

12:18.124 --> 12:19.540
And, uh, I've managed

12:19.541 --> 12:21.661
to talk the advertisers
down off the ledge,

12:21.662 --> 12:23.499
so I think we just
weather the storm, right?

12:23.500 --> 12:26.123
Well, the problem is we've
been asked to comment,

12:26.124 --> 12:28.624
because, um, apparently Mark...

12:28.625 --> 12:31.540
Records show that he got
married at the Eagle's Nest,

12:31.541 --> 12:34.415
Hitler's retreat in Bavaria.
A chapel below.

12:34.416 --> 12:35.625
(SHIV GROANS) Oh, God.

12:36.403 --> 12:37.518
Uh, ignore that.

12:37.519 --> 12:39.415
- She's not here.
- GERRI: His agent assures me

12:39.416 --> 12:41.332
that it was a coincidence,
they were on vacation

12:41.333 --> 12:42.666
- in the area.
- (KNOCKING ON GLASS)

12:42.667 --> 12:44.374
LOGAN: Yeah, well,
fuckin' big coincidence.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.999
Uh... (SIGHS)

12:46.833 --> 12:47.958
Is that curtains?

12:50.500 --> 12:53.832
I think he's toast.
Right? We just toss him.

12:53.833 --> 12:56.499
Hey. Come on. No coaching
from the sidelines.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.874
Uh, no. I'm not here.

12:57.875 --> 13:00.415
Oh, right. I forgot. You're not here.

13:00.416 --> 13:02.082
Well, what do you say, Ken?

13:02.083 --> 13:05.749
Hey. Enough. Cyd?

13:05.750 --> 13:08.791
We don't wanna fire
him. He's a big draw.

13:08.792 --> 13:12.332
And if we cave to this, then who's next?

13:12.333 --> 13:15.791
Tom, check him out,
turn his guts inside out.

13:15.792 --> 13:20.875
Uh, but nah. We back
talent. Ravenhead stays.

13:23.208 --> 13:25.082
Connor, you ready?

13:25.083 --> 13:28.082
You okay, honey? I know
how you are about death.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.832
CONNOR ROY: (SINGING)
♪ Happy deathday to Mo ♪

13:30.833 --> 13:34.165
- ♪ Happy deathday to Mo ♪
- Okay, not so sad.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.415
This is a big opportunity for me, baby.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.123
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:38.124 --> 13:39.749
Campaign financing.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.082
Mo knew a lot of
high-net-worth individuals.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.832
I'm gonna work the room,
meet some wallets.

13:43.833 --> 13:46.540
The whole church is gonna
be stuffed with weeping ATMs.

13:46.541 --> 13:49.290
Right. So, Marcia called.

13:49.291 --> 13:50.707
Marcia? She called you?

13:50.708 --> 13:52.916
Yeah. She wanted me
to talk to the widow,

13:52.917 --> 13:55.415
see what Mo told the biographer?

13:55.416 --> 13:57.040
No, this is good!

13:57.041 --> 13:59.916
They're involving you in their
disgusting little stratagems.

13:59.917 --> 14:01.415
- Right.
- It means they like you.

14:01.416 --> 14:04.832
Come on. Let's get ready to
shed a tear at Mo's funeral,

14:04.833 --> 14:06.248
AKA the gold rush.

14:06.249 --> 14:08.540
I'm getting a donor boner
just thinking about it.

14:08.541 --> 14:10.249
(SIGHS) That's cute.

14:15.249 --> 14:16.875
TOM: Yo! Hey.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.374
Oh...

14:18.375 --> 14:20.248
TOM: Hey, Greg. What's going on?

14:20.249 --> 14:21.832
Jonah, say hi.

14:21.833 --> 14:23.749
- Hey, Greg.
- Hey, Jonah.

14:23.750 --> 14:26.248
Hey, I'm thinking of taking
things to the next level.

14:26.249 --> 14:28.290
- GREG: Uh-huh?
- Footstool fiesta.

14:28.291 --> 14:30.457
We had a bet, Jonah lost.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.374
Be his turn to do it to me one day.

14:32.375 --> 14:33.416
Come on!

14:37.041 --> 14:38.124
Um...

14:44.500 --> 14:46.791
- Just, uh...
- Go ahead.

14:46.792 --> 14:49.440
Yeah. Let... Let me
know if I'm too heavy.

14:49.441 --> 14:51.457
Yep. Will do.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.791
So, uh, Herr Ravenhead. Do
you have anything for me,

14:53.792 --> 14:55.248
ahead of my meet?

14:55.249 --> 14:58.666
Um... Honestly, I've been,
uh, been asking around,

14:58.667 --> 15:00.290
and not much. Uh,

15:00.291 --> 15:03.916
I heard he named his dog
after Hitler's dog, maybe.

15:03.917 --> 15:05.290
Blondi.

15:05.291 --> 15:06.791
That's not good.

15:06.792 --> 15:09.248
But, you know, Logan
likes and America likes,

15:09.249 --> 15:11.457
and "Blondi" is pretty common.

15:11.458 --> 15:16.916
No, but I mean, fascist meeting,
Nazi wedding, Hitler dog...

15:16.917 --> 15:19.165
Oh, dude. If it's true, he's gone.

15:19.166 --> 15:20.998
I mean, Nazis, terrible, right?

15:20.999 --> 15:22.415
Nazis?

15:22.416 --> 15:23.832
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:23.833 --> 15:26.540
Yeah, they're... they're the worst.

15:26.541 --> 15:31.165
Yeah, sure. We all hate
Nazis. And we all hate Cyd.

15:31.166 --> 15:32.666
Right, Jonah?

15:32.667 --> 15:35.040
If we look at the aggregate
of all employment opportunities

15:35.041 --> 15:36.457
available on Earth right now,

15:36.458 --> 15:38.832
this is top one, two percent.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.916
We are basically in heaven.

15:40.917 --> 15:42.666
Well, aren't you positive.

15:42.667 --> 15:46.374
They'll beat that out of you.
What's your story, Hunky Dory?

15:46.375 --> 15:48.332
Me? I'm an enigma.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.499
You can't pigeon-hole me.
I'm there, then I'm gone.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.540
I'm intellectually promiscuous,
but culturally conservative,

15:53.541 --> 15:56.998
I work hard, but I do not
play hard. I play easy.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.332
- Why would you play hard?
- Good question.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.874
And what is it you're doing right now?

16:01.875 --> 16:04.457
I'm lurking. Like a dormant virus.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.582
Biding my time in the
Fort Meyers resort,

16:06.583 --> 16:08.791
but I'm being stymied
by a variety of enemies

16:08.792 --> 16:10.248
who are envious of my talents.

16:10.249 --> 16:12.123
- Obviously.
- Brian.

16:12.124 --> 16:16.832
Uh, yeah. Ron. Ron... Rockstone.

16:16.833 --> 16:20.540
Sure, man. Very solid name.

16:20.541 --> 16:22.374
GERRI: In terms of proxy statements,

16:22.375 --> 16:23.832
I'm not sure how much you need to see.

16:23.833 --> 16:25.624
SHIV: Uh, yeah. Maybe
just show me everything.

16:25.625 --> 16:28.499
Yeah, uh, because, uh,
that's a lot of material.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.998
I can process pretty quick.

16:29.999 --> 16:32.832
And after this perhaps
we sit down with my dad,

16:32.833 --> 16:34.540
and go through PR strategy?

16:34.541 --> 16:36.374
Oh. He's unavailable this afternoon.

16:36.375 --> 16:38.624
Because what? Monkey
gland butt injection?

16:38.625 --> 16:40.624
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. Something like that!

16:40.625 --> 16:41.916
Getting his hair blown out.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.457
Yeah, his afternoon is greyed-out.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.540
And then there's Mo's funeral.

16:45.541 --> 16:46.792
- Yeah...
- (KNOCKING ON GLASS)

16:53.750 --> 16:55.165
Does Karolina know?

16:55.166 --> 16:57.874
- Has Colin done his thing?
- JESS JORDAN: Mm-hmm.

16:57.875 --> 16:59.082
(GERRI SIGHS) Okay.

16:59.083 --> 17:00.832
- Thank you, Jess.
- Okay.

17:00.833 --> 17:03.917
- What was that?
- Nothing.

17:04.708 --> 17:05.958
Uh-huh. Sure.

17:07.625 --> 17:11.249
Well, Jess, so Kendall.

17:11.999 --> 17:13.790
And Karolina...

17:13.791 --> 17:17.208
so public-facing. But Colin, too?

17:17.625 --> 17:19.248
Grubby.

17:19.249 --> 17:21.082
And Dad's in a secret meeting,

17:21.083 --> 17:23.458
and I'm in here with a coloring book.

17:24.999 --> 17:26.624
What's goin' on, Gerri?

17:26.625 --> 17:28.082
Maybe you should talk to your dad.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.124
Oh, come on. It's me. What's happening?

17:32.917 --> 17:34.290
It's Kendall.

17:34.291 --> 17:36.040
What, is he huffing Sharpies again?

17:36.041 --> 17:37.123
Shoplifting.

17:37.124 --> 17:40.415
He's stealing? Stealing what?

17:40.416 --> 17:43.123
Candy and vape fluid, I believe.

17:43.124 --> 17:44.540
He's stealing vape fluid?

17:44.541 --> 17:47.124
What? He could buy the entire industry.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.791
Well, is someone talking
to him? Is he suspended?

17:50.792 --> 17:53.624
Hmm. We're cleaning it up
without getting him involved.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.499
Oh, good. That'll teach him a lesson.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.749
I'm sorry, what the fuck?

17:56.750 --> 17:58.457
How many lives does this guy have?

17:58.458 --> 18:00.583
Logan wants to keep it down low.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.165
- SHIV: Hey.
- Hey.

18:06.166 --> 18:10.290
Just, uh, wanted to check
in and see how you're doing.

18:10.291 --> 18:12.749
Good. Interesting. Yeah.

18:12.750 --> 18:16.582
Yeah, great. (SIGHS)
So, uh, what's goin' on?

18:16.583 --> 18:18.165
How are you?

18:18.166 --> 18:19.707
What's your next move?

18:19.708 --> 18:23.998
Are you thinking media?
Like, here, or somewhere else?

18:23.999 --> 18:25.248
Division?

18:25.249 --> 18:27.415
Yeah, you know, I don't know, but, uh...

18:27.416 --> 18:30.166
- I... Do I have to tell you?
- No, sure.

18:30.833 --> 18:32.165
Hey, listen.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.667
- I know you lost your job.
- I walked out.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.999
Okay, whatever. It's all good.

18:39.875 --> 18:43.832
I just, uh... Yeah, I don't know. I...

18:43.833 --> 18:46.540
- It's good to see you.
- Cool.

18:46.541 --> 18:47.957
Maybe I should come in more often.

18:47.958 --> 18:51.290
- (KNOCKING ON GLASS)
- Ken? Your thing.

18:51.291 --> 18:52.833
- She's en route.
- Okay.

18:53.917 --> 18:55.999
- What's that?
- Ah, it's nothing.

18:57.917 --> 19:01.332
Shiv, it's... it's, uh,
it's not a thing. Okay?

19:01.333 --> 19:02.582
I just can't say.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.749
That's fine, Ken. Do your secret shit.

19:04.750 --> 19:06.165
You seem to be mistaking me

19:06.166 --> 19:07.726
for someone you're in competition with.

Smuggled in like
Cleopatra in the carpet.

Please, have a seat.

20:23.833 --> 20:26.040
KENDALL: Now, can I get
you something to drink?

20:26.041 --> 20:28.123
Oh, just some water, thanks.

20:28.124 --> 20:30.749
- Quite a view.
- LOGAN: Mm.

20:30.750 --> 20:33.207
Lady Liberty.

20:33.208 --> 20:38.290
So, the agenda of the meeting
is just to sort of, you know,

20:38.291 --> 20:41.248
check in on how we can
all better work together

20:41.249 --> 20:43.415
to protect journalists
in hostile environments,

20:43.416 --> 20:44.749
- and any other areas...
- Uh, yeah, yeah,

20:44.750 --> 20:46.123
thank you for the cover story

20:46.124 --> 20:48.540
but we don't need to
bother with all that.

20:48.541 --> 20:51.998
We know you're interested
in an acquisition again,

20:51.999 --> 20:54.624
and, uh, I have a message.

20:54.625 --> 20:55.963
- Oh.
- RHEA: Yeah.

20:55.964 --> 20:59.165
The message would be, on
behalf of the Pierce family,

20:59.166 --> 21:01.666
and the media organization
that it's privately owned

21:01.667 --> 21:03.332
for 150 years,

21:03.333 --> 21:05.998
the message would be a
typically balanced, nuanced,

21:05.999 --> 21:08.874
and objective "fuck off".

21:08.875 --> 21:10.998
Very nuanced.

21:10.999 --> 21:13.791
And is that the view
of the whole family?

21:13.792 --> 21:15.207
They're united in that?

21:15.208 --> 21:19.082
Well, I don't involve myself
in the palace intrigue,

21:19.083 --> 21:21.707
but overall, the family
knows what you're after,

21:21.708 --> 21:23.207
and they're not interested.

21:23.208 --> 21:25.749
And what am I after?

21:25.750 --> 21:28.666
You're playing your
favorite tune again, no?

21:28.667 --> 21:30.957
Only this time, I take
it some genius banker

21:30.958 --> 21:33.415
has convinced you that the
only way to keep the jackals out

21:33.416 --> 21:36.791
is to leverage yourself until
you're too big to take down.

21:36.792 --> 21:41.165
Well, I can assure you that
is not a fair characterization

21:41.166 --> 21:43.540
- of what we're doing here.
- LOGAN: Look.

21:43.541 --> 21:44.874
What do they want?

21:44.875 --> 21:46.499
- The Pierces? In general?
- Mm-hmm.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.166
- Who knows?
- So there is a price?

21:50.583 --> 21:53.499
All I can say is that at this point, uh,

21:53.500 --> 21:55.374
the position is they're not interested.

21:55.375 --> 21:58.916
And you? What do you think?

21:58.917 --> 22:01.333
I think they're amazing custodians.

22:03.166 --> 22:06.123
So you don't have a position
on who your owner is,

22:06.124 --> 22:08.707
because that would
presumably affect things,

22:08.708 --> 22:10.832
- if you weighed in?
- I'm a chief executive.

22:10.833 --> 22:15.207
I take my orders from the
board. I'm a mere tool.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.123
- KENDALL: Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

22:17.124 --> 22:20.208
Anyway, I hope this hasn't
been too disappointing.

22:20.875 --> 22:21.917
It's been fun.

22:24.667 --> 22:28.041

22:28.958 --> 22:30.998
But it only works for me fast.

- LOGAN: Very fast.
- Mm-hmm.

22:33.124 --> 22:36.582
So, please, stay. Have lunch.

22:36.583 --> 22:39.082
Oh, uh... My tummy is delicate.

22:39.083 --> 22:41.917
We really only eat
Pulitzer over at Pierce.

22:42.541 --> 22:43.916
You eat.

22:43.917 --> 22:45.415
I'll, uh...

22:45.416 --> 22:48.416
stay for five and skulk
out the way I skulked in.

22:50.917 --> 22:53.457
PAULA: Okay, everyone, now
that you've found a partner,

22:53.458 --> 22:54.749
for this next exercise,

22:54.750 --> 22:56.499
I'd like you all to
come up with some ideas

22:56.500 --> 22:58.582
for new rides or attractions.

22:58.583 --> 23:00.248
And then, uh, work it up into a pitch,

23:00.249 --> 23:01.832
and we're gonna present
to the group, okay?

23:01.833 --> 23:04.957
What is this, fucking school?
We're pitching now?

23:04.958 --> 23:07.123
What if we fuck it? What if
I can't think of anything?

23:07.124 --> 23:09.082
I don't have anything prepared.
Did you know about this?

23:09.083 --> 23:11.248
This is cool. Sounds
like a great exercise.

23:11.249 --> 23:12.791
You have no fucking understanding

23:12.792 --> 23:14.082
of how this works, do you?

23:14.083 --> 23:16.957
Like, this, right here?
This is a rank and yank.

23:16.958 --> 23:18.957
It's fucking up or out.

23:18.958 --> 23:21.998
This is a death march
through a fucking minefield.

23:21.999 --> 23:24.082
Okay, well, come on.
What do people like?

23:24.083 --> 23:25.540
What do everyday people like?

23:25.541 --> 23:28.332

the fuck should I know

23:29.625 --> 23:32.082
I like booking out a
suite at the Chateau,

23:32.083 --> 23:34.165
and snorting purified sertraline

23:34.166 --> 23:36.165

they're prostitutes yet.

Interesting hobby, Ron Rockstone.

like? What do you like?

- Me?
- Yeah.

23:43.333 --> 23:44.832
Okay, uh,

23:44.833 --> 23:46.957
I enjoy spending time with
my nephews, Cooper and Clark.

23:46.958 --> 23:50.165
I hike. I have several
high-end racing drones.

Uh, where's Cyd?

24:24.999 --> 24:26.540
She's out on a thing, but she's...

24:26.541 --> 24:28.165
she thought it would be
great for us to check in,

- huh?
- Oh, dude. No, no.

We both know, I think,
how dumb these things are.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.791
You know how it is.
It's just due diligence

with all the turbulence,
and, can I just...

24:43.166 --> 24:44.791
just need to check a few boxes.

24:44.792 --> 24:47.207
Sure, sure. Thank you
for the show of faith.

24:47.208 --> 24:52.207
No, no. No... No problem. Okay, right.

Okay, so this is embarrassing,
but, um, just for the record,

31:17.541 --> 31:20.290
but I heard that he
was just a great guy.

31:20.291 --> 31:22.874
- Um, Mo?
- Your husband?

31:22.875 --> 31:24.124
We're so sorry.

31:26.999 --> 31:28.374
His name's not Mo.

31:28.375 --> 31:31.791
- What? You call him Mo.
- His name's Lester.

31:31.792 --> 31:34.207
Okay, so why does everyone call him Mo?

31:34.208 --> 31:36.998
His real name is Lester.
(STAMMERS) It was...

31:36.999 --> 31:38.791
I guess I haven't thought
about it for a while,

31:38.792 --> 31:40.457
but it was kind of a joke.

31:40.458 --> 31:44.998
- Like what?
- Mo-Lester.

31:44.999 --> 31:46.792
I guess it wasn't a very nice joke.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.499
- And was he one?
- Oh, God, no.

31:51.500 --> 31:53.540
Just, you know...

31:53.541 --> 31:57.040
Old Mr. Fiddlesticks, Uncle Meathands.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.290
Right.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.916
Dad wouldn't let us
in the pool with him.

31:59.917 --> 32:02.916
But, you know, the guys
of that generation...

32:02.917 --> 32:04.332
It was a different time.

32:04.333 --> 32:05.666
Okay.

32:05.667 --> 32:07.207

the end of this boner.

there has been an incident at ATN.

32:41.166 --> 32:43.040
- My dad okay?
- It's been suggested

32:43.041 --> 32:45.582
it could be a concerted
attack against the family.

32:45.583 --> 32:48.040
Do you want us to take you
to a more secure location?

32:48.041 --> 32:50.916

I don't think there's anything
to even say without that.

41:03.311 --> 41:06.268
Well, okay, there are models,
right, for an independent board.

41:06.269 --> 41:08.685
And forgetting the numbers,
there are structures designed

41:08.686 --> 41:10.602
to ensure the current
philosophical approach

41:10.603 --> 41:11.685
is protected.

41:11.686 --> 41:14.019
Okay, thank you. And now, um...

41:14.852 --> 41:16.851
remembering the numbers,

41:16.852 --> 41:18.893
what would move the dial for them?

41:18.894 --> 41:20.810
22.5?

41:20.811 --> 41:24.727
Now, honestly, be careful
or I'll take you seriously.

41:24.728 --> 41:27.060
Well, if the business side can work,

41:27.061 --> 41:29.893
then I guess one pitch
for the family could be,

41:29.894 --> 41:31.602
"Waystar isn't coming in to fuck you,

41:31.603 --> 41:34.560
but to make sweet, sweet,
Barry White-investment love."

41:34.561 --> 41:36.685
Beauty saved by the
beast would be the flavor.

41:36.686 --> 41:40.227
I think it's telling that
your most positive spin

41:40.228 --> 41:43.602
still sounds a bit rapey.

41:43.603 --> 41:47.935
- Hey. Do you trust me?
- Do I trust you?

41:47.936 --> 41:49.602
SHIV: That's not really the issue, Dad.

41:49.603 --> 41:50.976
I mean, you're not
gonna be around forever,

41:50.977 --> 41:52.310
so there need to be structures in place

41:52.311 --> 41:54.394
- that are...
- Siobhan. Please.

41:55.645 --> 41:57.227
This is what it comes down to.

41:57.228 --> 41:58.935
You know, we can draw up some agreement

41:58.936 --> 42:00.935
with any number of provisions in it,

42:00.936 --> 42:04.477
but you know that if I want,
I'll find a way round it.

If I say I won't fuck Pierce over,

42:10.102 --> 42:13.770

editors, their people,

42:14.728 --> 42:16.435

42:16.436 --> 42:18.769
And will you tell them to trust me?

42:18.770 --> 42:20.143
Uh-huh.

42:20.144 --> 42:23.603
Because when I say
something will happen...

42:26.228 --> 42:29.185
that thing will happen.

42:29.186 --> 42:30.603
Am I right, kids?

42:32.520 --> 42:35.143
- Right.
- Um, right.

42:35.144 --> 42:36.644
So, will you tell 'em?

42:36.645 --> 42:39.936
Twenty-four. And they can trust me.

42:44.811 --> 42:47.311
I, um... I'm with him.

42:51.977 --> 42:53.644

42:53.645 --> 42:56.893
Yes. Apparently it's impregnable.

the winning pitch.

they were going to give it to,

43:16.436 --> 43:17.810

43:17.811 --> 43:18.935

Still, it's complicated.
It was a different time.

Well, maybe. Maybe I will.

53:45.513 --> 53:47.429
Maybe I'll just leave you on the pillow

53:47.430 --> 53:49.928
so you can hear my brilliance cascading.

53:49.929 --> 53:51.637
Fine. I've heard plenty worse

53:51.638 --> 53:54.012
than a spoiled brat
ejaculating on himself.

53:54.013 --> 53:56.262
Oh, yeah? You sure about that?

53:56.263 --> 53:58.970

now for all you know.

54:18.597 --> 54:21.638
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I am.

You little slime puppy.

54:27.929 --> 54:31.679
Yes. Yeah, what else am I?

You're revolting, Roman.

54:33.054 --> 54:34.805
Yes. Yeah.

Only you can be trusted
with the meds, huh?

54:48.430 --> 54:51.762
Yeah. Till we have a system going on.

54:51.763 --> 54:54.095
Mm-hmm. So here's a question.

54:54.096 --> 54:57.429
What the fuck is going
on between you and Dad?

54:57.430 --> 54:59.095
What do you mean?

54:59.096 --> 55:03.137
Do you have something on
him? Are you blackmailing Dad?

55:03.138 --> 55:07.721
No. I'm... I'm... I don't know...
We're... We're just in, uh...

55:07.722 --> 55:10.304
We're just in a good...
good place these days.

55:10.305 --> 55:12.304
Uh-huh?

55:12.305 --> 55:14.721
All right. Do you have a deal with him?

55:14.722 --> 55:17.679
Did he make you an
offer in the Hamptons?

55:17.680 --> 55:23.971
Um, no. No, Shiv.
There's... There's no deal.

55:25.929 --> 55:27.679
I promise you.

55:27.680 --> 55:31.262
Then what? Why's he protecting you?

55:31.263 --> 55:33.762
- Protecting me?
- (SHIV SCOFFS)

55:33.763 --> 55:36.679
Yeah, the drugs, the shoplifting,

55:36.680 --> 55:39.762
the... the fucking... the takeover bid.

55:39.763 --> 55:42.345
Yeah, I'm not sure what you mean.

55:42.346 --> 55:43.804
Uh-huh.

55:43.805 --> 55:46.346
Anyway, why do you care so much?

55:47.763 --> 55:50.762
You know, what... what is
this? What's going on here?

55:50.763 --> 55:54.679
- You comin' in?
- Can we just talk?

55:54.680 --> 55:57.888

There is an atmosphere.

56:04.888 --> 56:06.013
Uh...

56:09.179 --> 56:12.387
Yeah, I don't know. He's... He's just...

56:12.388 --> 56:17.762
Maybe, uh, he's concerned
about me, for whatever reason.

56:17.763 --> 56:20.178
Yeah? For whatever reason?

56:20.179 --> 56:21.721
You'd need to ask him.

56:21.722 --> 56:24.388
You can't tell me? You can't
tell me what's going on?

56:26.013 --> 56:27.054
No.

56:27.929 --> 56:29.054
Fucking look at me.

56:31.888 --> 56:34.555
Shiv. It's not gonna be me.

56:38.847 --> 56:41.430
Right. You wanna tell me why?

56:43.888 --> 56:45.721
Come here. Give me a hug.

56:45.722 --> 56:47.388
- Come here.
- Give you a hug?

(KENDALL SNIFFLES)

57:06.805 --> 57:11.888
I would just ask that
you take care of me,

57:13.922 --> 57:18.839
because, uh, if Dad
didn't need me right now

57:21.847 --> 57:23.597
I don't exactly know...

57:27.054 --> 57:28.929
what I would be for.

57:34.597 --> 57:36.263
You wanna talk some more?

I r... I really can't.

57:43.638 --> 57:44.680
But, uh...

thank you.
