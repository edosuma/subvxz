04:30.471 --> 04:31.839

04:33.073 --> 04:34.975
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.011

05:27.060 --> 05:28.128

05:28.161 --> 05:29.830

BASED ON THE FACT
THAT HE'S THE HEAD

05:30.998 --> 05:32.032
OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC TRUST.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.435

HE WOULD HAVE LOVED

05:38.472 --> 05:41.074

I TRUST NO ONE.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.080
- WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
TO TRUST ME.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.982
THE CHARGES ARE SUBSTANTIAL.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.452
- ONLY IN AMERICA.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.187
BERLUSCONI WILL DO ANYTHING
TO STOP ME.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.559
HE'S THE GEPPETTO. HE'S THE ONE
WHO PULLS THE STRINGS.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.929
THEY ARE LOOKING AT ME
LIKE AN INSECT

06:35.963 --> 06:37.998
RIGHT NOW...AREN'T THEY?

06:38.031 --> 06:39.967
- WELL, THEY MAY BE LOOKING,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.903
BUT THEY CAN'T TOUCH.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.406
- [groans]

06:49.610 --> 06:51.845

06:59.186 --> 07:02.122
SO ANOTHER D.S.K.

07:02.155 --> 07:05.025
- IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S OPEN SEASON
ON HOTEL MAIDS, COUNSELOR.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.027
- WELL, THE VICTIM MADE
AN IMMEDIATE OUTCRY.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.195
HER STORY'S BEEN CONSISTENT.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.464
- AND WE FOUND A MIXTURE
OF SEMEN AND SALIVA AT THE SCENE

07:10.498 --> 07:12.933
AND WE PULLED OUT A NICE JUICY
COCKTAIL FROM THE DRAIN.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.868

DETECTIVE ROLLINS.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.504

07:16.537 --> 07:20.007
OKAY, WELL...IT'S ENOUGH

07:22.510 --> 07:24.578
AND JOSEPH IS EIGHT.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.079
- AND THEY'RE GOOD BOYS?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.115
- THEY ARE GOOD BOYS.

07:29.517 --> 07:32.586
- NOW THEIR FATHER IS...
STILL IN SUDAN?

07:32.620 --> 07:35.489
- NO. KILLED IN THE FIGHTING.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.157
- OH.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.893
- THIS MAN WHO...

07:39.927 --> 07:44.097
THEY TELL ME
HE IS SOMEONE RICH? IMPORTANT?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.667
- YES.

07:46.700 --> 07:51.639
MIRIAM, UH...THIS
ISN'T GONNA BE EASY,

07:51.672 --> 07:53.874
BUT AS LONG AS YOU TELL ME
THE TRUTH,

07:53.907 --> 07:55.909
I DON'T CARE WHO THIS MAN
THINKS HE IS.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.045
HE'S GOING TO JAIL.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.150
- IL SIGNOR DISTASIO
IS ONE OF THE CONTINENT'S

08:03.183 --> 08:04.284
MOST CHARMING MEN.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.619
TO WOMEN, HE IS A MAGNET.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.855
HE IS NOT A, UM,
STUPRATORE...

08:07.888 --> 08:08.689
A RAPIST.

08:08.722 --> 08:11.058
- AND YET WE DO HAVE
PROBABLE CAUSE.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.860
- PERHAPS I AM BEING TOO OBTUSE.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.863
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SIGNOR DISTASIO
WAS DOING YESTERDAY AFTERNOON?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.998
- WELL, BASED ON THE COMPLAINTS
LEVELED HIS WAY TODAY,

08:18.031 --> 08:19.299
I'D HATE TO GUESS.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.268
- [chuckles]
HE WAS PLAYING GOLF...

08:21.301 --> 08:23.003
WITH YOUR PRESIDENT.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.872
- HOW'D HE DO?

08:24.905 --> 08:27.207
[knock at door]

08:27.240 --> 08:31.044
MR. CUTTER,
D.A.'S SVU BUREAU CHIEF,

08:31.078 --> 08:33.914
THIS IS MR. FEDELI,
THE ITALIAN CONSUL GENERAL.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.016
- SORRY TO MEET UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.019
WE ALL REALIZE
IT'S A DELICATE SITUATION.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.088
- NO, NO, NO.
IT IS A FARCE.

08:41.121 --> 08:45.325
AS HEAD OF THE G.E.T.,
ROBERTO HAS DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.060
YOU CANNOT HOLD HIM.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.162
- YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE THAT UP
WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.131
AND IF HE DOES HAVE IMMUNITY,
IT'S FROM PROSECUTION,

08:51.164 --> 08:52.132
NOT ARREST.

08:52.165 --> 08:55.569
- MR. FEDELI, I ASSURE YOU
THAT MR. DISTASIO

08:55.603 --> 08:58.205
IS BEING AFFORDED THE RIGHTS
OF ANY OTHER SUSPECT.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.308
- HE IS NOT ANY SUSPECT.

09:01.341 --> 09:05.045
WHY ELSE HAS THERE BEEN
THIS, UH, RUSH TO JUDGMENT?

09:05.078 --> 09:09.282
- NYPD DID THEIR JOB,
MR. FEDELI,

09:09.316 --> 09:12.285
AND I HAVE TO LET
MY OFFICE DO OURS.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.697
TELL ME YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.701

09:37.645 --> 09:39.212

09:39.246 --> 09:41.181
- MIRIAM, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST HAVE A SEAT

09:41.214 --> 09:43.016
RIGHT HERE,
AND I'M GONNA COME GET YOU

09:43.050 --> 09:45.018
WHEN WE'RE READY
FOR THE LINE-UP, OKAY?

09:45.052 --> 09:47.621
I'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND.

09:47.655 --> 09:48.889

09:48.922 --> 09:51.291
HI. AMANDA ROLLINS.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.100

10:01.068 --> 10:03.904
I, UM, I'VE STUDIED
A LOT OF YOUR CASES.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.639
I USED SOME OF THE STUFF YOU DID
ON THE BROWN CASE--

10:05.673 --> 10:07.074
THE--THE INFANT HOMICIDE.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.710

10:09.743 --> 10:10.844
- SURE.

10:10.878 --> 10:14.247
- DISTASIO CHARGED HIS HOTEL
TO HIS PERSONAL ACCOUNT,

10:14.281 --> 10:15.348
NOT TO THE G.E.T.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.884
- MM, BYE-BYE IMMUNITY.

10:16.917 --> 10:20.187

THAT'S STATE'S CALL.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.055
SO WHERE ARE WE

EXAM BACKS HER UP.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.927

10:26.960 --> 10:28.161
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG

- WELL, I GOT MY GUYS

10:30.030 --> 10:33.901
TRYING TO CORRAL FIVE MEN
WHO MATCH DISTASIO.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.904

10:41.074 --> 10:42.042
NO ARRESTS.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.311
IMMIGRATED HERE THREE YEARS AGO
FROM THE SUDAN.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.913
POLITICAL ASYLUM.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.115
- GO OVER HER PAST
WITH A FINE-TOOTH COMB.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.918
[phone ringing]
OH, I GOTTA TAKE THIS.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.953
HILLARY'S PEOPLE.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.256
- I HEARD ABOUT THE SHOOTING.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.424
IS STABLER COMING BACK?

10:57.457 --> 11:00.728
- THAT'S UP TO HIM.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.907
- [gasps]
THAT IS HIM. NUMBER FOUR.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.408
Cragen: TAKE YOUR TIME.
- NO, THAT IS HIM.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.310
NUMBER FOUR, THAT IS HIM.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.146
- OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
LET'S GO.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.390
- AND NOW I'M RELEASED?

11:30.423 --> 11:33.060
- OH, NO. YOU ARE GOING
TO THE HOSPITAL.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.394
- THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH ME.

11:34.427 --> 11:37.097
- IT'S NOT A CHECK-UP,
IT'S A PROCEDURE.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.299
- ON THE WORD OF A MAID?

11:39.332 --> 11:44.004
- MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A MAID.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.205
- IT'S BEEN
A TOUGH FEW MONTHS.

11:45.238 --> 11:49.442
WE ALL KNOW THERE'S A BULL'S-EYE
ON SVU FROM THE TOP DOWN.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.311
WE ARE ALL
UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.113
WE WORK THIS CASE BY THE BOOK,

11:53.146 --> 11:54.247
LIKE OUR JOBS DEPEND ON IT.

11:54.281 --> 11:57.184
- THE D.A.'S OFFICE IS GONNA PUT
THE VICTIM AND HER KIDS

11:57.217 --> 11:59.086
UP AT A HOTEL, KEEP THEM AWAY
FROM THE CIRCUS.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.922
- GOOD. DISTASIO'S GOT
A WORLD-CLASS P.R. TEAM.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.391
HE'S GONNA TRY TO GET TO HER
OR DIRTY HER OR BOTH.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.927
- ROMEO'S READY
FOR HIS FORENSIC EXAM.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.129
- DON'T LET YOUR FEELINGS
GET IN THE WAY, DETECTIVE.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.131
YOU AND LIV TAKE HIM
OUT A SIDE DOOR.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.100
NO CAMERAS, NO PERP WALK.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.136
- NO DOUBT.
WE'RE PROFESSIONALS, CAPTAIN.

12:17.104 --> 12:21.308
[shouting]

12:21.341 --> 12:23.010
- SORRISO PER LA CAMERA.

12:23.043 --> 12:26.914
- I THOUGHT IN AMERICA YOU WERE
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.149
BUT YOU LET THEM
TAKE MY PICTURE.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.185
- FREEDOM OF PRESS, BABY.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.492
- NEXT,
HAIR SAMPLES.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.963
THIS MAY HURT.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.164
- [grunts]

12:44.197 --> 12:48.335
SO MUCH CARE TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE EVIDENCE IS UNCORRUPTED,

12:48.368 --> 12:54.107
BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THAT
THE WHOLE PROCESS IS CORRUPTED.

12:56.009 --> 13:00.948
THEY WILL FIND NO EVIDENCE
OF SEX WITH THAT WOMAN.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.050
I'VE HAD A VASECTOMY.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.018
- SOMEBODY TOLD YOU WRONG.

13:05.052 --> 13:07.154
- DNA IS LIKE GOD...
IT'S EVERYWHERE.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.222
DROP YOUR SHORTS.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.260
- HEY, SERGEANT.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.063
WORKED UP A TIMELINE
OFF THE MAID'S KEYCARD.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.066
THIS GUY'S ONE OF THE MOST
POWERFUL MEN IN THE WHOLE WORLD,

13:19.099 --> 13:21.468
AND HE THROWS IT ALL AWAY
IN LESS THAN 20 MINUTES?

13:21.501 --> 13:24.304
- "ABSOLUTE POWER
CORRUPTS ABSOLUTELY."

13:24.337 --> 13:26.306
- I KNOW DISTASIO'S
LAWYERED UP,

13:26.339 --> 13:28.308
BUT HAS ANYONE TRIED
TO SMALL TALK HIM?

13:28.341 --> 13:32.512
- WELL, HE'S BEEN OBLIVIOUS
TO MY CHARMS.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.522
- IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE LUNCH?

13:44.424 --> 13:48.028
THIS MIGHT BE BETTER.

13:48.061 --> 13:52.065
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T GET REAL
ITALIAN FOOD WHERE I'M FROM.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.169
- IF I MAY...

13:56.203 --> 14:00.473
IT SEEMS YOU CANNOT GET REAL
ITALIAN FOOD HERE EITHER.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.043
- NO?
THEY SAID IT WAS GOOD.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.445
AND THEY SAID
THEY DELIVERED.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.017
- A MAN IS MEASURED
BY HIS APPETITES.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.519
- A WOMAN IS...

14:12.552 --> 14:15.422
MEASURED BY COSMO.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.291
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.261
IN SOME PLACES, A MAN IS...

14:21.294 --> 14:25.032
PRAISED FOR
THE SCOPE OF HIS...PASSIONS.

14:25.065 --> 14:28.201
IN OTHER PLACES,
IT'S SEEN AS A WEAKNESS.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.470
- WEAKNESS IS REPELLENT
TO WOMEN

14:30.503 --> 14:33.340
AND ANATHEMA TO SUCCESS.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.042
- I WISH IT WAS
THE SAME FOR WOMEN.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.077
[laughs]

14:37.110 --> 14:40.247
WEAKNESS...MM.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.950
MOST MEN ARE TURNED ON
BY WEAKNESS.

14:42.983 --> 14:48.221
- AH, BUT IT IS NOT
A WOMAN'S WEAKNESS.

14:48.255 --> 14:53.293
THE DANCE--THE FANTASY THAT
SHE HAS RELINQUISHED SOMETHING--

14:53.326 --> 14:55.996
THAT IS HER POWER.

14:59.266 --> 15:03.536
THE PARRY HOLDS AS MUCH POWER
AS THE THRUST.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.339
- I'VE GOTTA LEVEL WITH YOU.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.475
THIS MAID?

15:08.508 --> 15:10.343
HER STORY?

15:10.377 --> 15:13.480
YOU KNOW YOU GOT A LOT MORE
TO LOSE THAN SHE DOES.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.349
- THERE'S AN ITALIAN SAYING,

15:16.383 --> 15:21.221
"FATTI MASCHI,
PAROLE FEMMINE."

15:21.254 --> 15:25.492
MAN HAS FACTS,
WOMAN HAS WORDS.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.061
- EXACTLY.

15:28.095 --> 15:31.364
AND ALL WE HAVE RIGHT NOW
ARE THIS WOMAN'S WORDS.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.334
SURE WOULD LIKE
TO HEAR YOUR FACTS.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.309
- I'M SORRY, SIGNORINA.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.211
I'M VERY TIRED.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.380
BUT...THANK YOU FOR THE MEAL.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.082
- NO PROBLEM.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.484
MAYBE WE CAN
TALK AGAIN LATER.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.752
- LATER?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.487
I WILL BE FREE,

15:54.521 --> 15:56.990
AND YOU'LL BE OUT OF A JOB.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.166
- DOCKET ENDING 1701,

16:06.199 --> 16:07.767
PEOPLE VERSUS ROBERTO DISTASIO.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.336
THE CHARGES ARE
RAPE IN THE FIRST DEGREE,

16:09.369 --> 16:10.403
ASSAULT IN THE SECOND DEGREE,

16:10.437 --> 16:12.305
AND UNLAWFUL IMPRISONMENT
IN THE SECOND DEGREE.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.406
- HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.108
- I AM NOT GUILTY.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.409
- NOT GUILTY.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.444
- PEOPLE ON BAIL?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.246
- WE REQUEST REMAND,
YOUR HONOR.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.514
TWO HOURS AFTER MR. DISTASIO
COMMITTED A VIOLENT CRIME,

16:21.548 --> 16:23.483
HE WAS APPREHENDED
ON A PLANE BOUND FOR ITALY.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.118
THAT DEFINES FLIGHT RISK.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.519
- YOUR HONOR, MY CLIENT
HAS NO CRIMINAL RECORD

16:26.553 --> 16:28.355
AND PROSECUTION
IS WELL AWARE

16:28.388 --> 16:31.258
THAT THERE IS
AN EXTRADITION TREATY IN PLACE.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.360
- IN PLACE IS NOT THE SAME
AS IN USE.

16:33.393 --> 16:36.363
- I AGREE.
DEFENDANT IS REMANDED TO RIKERS.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.199
[gavel bangs]

16:41.134 --> 16:45.105
- EVEN IN JAIL,
HE WILL FIND US.

16:45.138 --> 16:48.341
THEY SAY...

16:48.375 --> 16:53.513
HE HAS AGENTS FROM THE CIA
WORKING FOR HIM.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.482
- HE HAS A DEFENSE TEAM,
AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY

16:55.515 --> 16:57.517
TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU
THAT THEY CAN.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.252
THEY WILL MAKE ACCUSATIONS.
- OFFICER...

16:59.286 --> 17:03.190
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE BOYS DOWN
TO THE SNACK MACHINE?

17:03.223 --> 17:05.125
- I WANT MY CHILDREN HERE.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.527
- I PROMISE YOU THEY'LL BE SAFE
WITH THE OFFICER.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.062
JUST FOR A MINUTE.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.531
HEY, GUYS, COME ON.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.501
GET UP.
GO WITH THE OFFICER.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.269
- MIRIAM...

17:16.303 --> 17:19.139
THE DEFENSE IS GOING TO SAY
THAT YOU DID THIS FOR MONEY.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.540
- I WOULD NEVER.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.775
NOT FOR ANY MONEY.

17:22.809 --> 17:23.976
- OKAY, GOOD,

17:24.010 --> 17:27.180
BUT IF THERE'S ANY PART OF
THE STORY YOU ARE LEAVING OUT--

17:27.214 --> 17:29.116
- ANY MISCOMMUNICATION,

17:29.149 --> 17:30.483
ANY MISUNDERSTANDING--

17:30.517 --> 17:33.386
- NO, HE RAPED ME.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.455
AND HE'S GOING
TO GET AWAY WITH IT.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.458
HE CAN FIND ME,
DO WHAT HE WANT TO ME,

17:38.491 --> 17:40.260
JUST LIKE THE SOLDIERS.

17:40.293 --> 17:45.532
ONE YEAR AFTER MY FAMILY ESCAPE
OVER THE BORDER TO SUDAN,

17:45.565 --> 17:48.535
MEN ON HORSES
COME TO MY VILLAGE

17:48.568 --> 17:51.238
AND KILLED EVERYONE.

17:51.271 --> 17:55.342
THE MISSIONARY
AT THE REFUGEE CAMP,

17:55.375 --> 17:59.279
HE TOLD ME
IF I BRING MY SONS TO AMERICA,

17:59.312 --> 18:03.883
THERE IS NO VIOLENCE,
NO FIGHTING.

18:03.916 --> 18:08.788
SOMEONE FROM AFRICA
IS THE PRESIDENT OF EVERYTHING.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.824
EVERYTHING.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.580
- WHAT DOES I.A.B. WANT?

18:38.451 --> 18:40.787
THAT WAS
A GOOD SHOOTING, CAPTAIN.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.889
ELLIOT WAS CLEARED.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.292
- ON THAT ONE.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.927
NOW INTERNAL AFFAIRS WANTS
TO GO OVER HIS ENTIRE JACKET.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.330
- LET 'EM.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.431
THERE'S NOTHING TO FIND.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.800
- LIV...

18:53.833 --> 18:56.369
IF IT WAS
HIS FIRST GOOD SHOOTING, OKAY,

18:56.403 --> 18:57.404
MAYBE EVEN HIS SECOND,

18:57.437 --> 18:58.538
BUT IT'S HIS SIXTH.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.873
THE WHOLE SQUAD IS ON NOTICE.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.310
- SO WHAT,
SO HE'S THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB?

19:03.343 --> 19:05.312
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GIVE HIM UP?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.847
- YOU KNOW ME
BETTER THAN THAT.

19:07.880 --> 19:08.948
HE'S LIKE A SON TO ME.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.418
I'VE BEEN PUSHING
AS HARD AS I CAN.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.953
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW IT'S GONNA SHAKE OUT.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.455
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:15.488 --> 19:18.525
- THAT MEANS, IF ELLIOT WANTS
TO KEEP HIS JOB,

19:18.558 --> 19:20.893
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO SUBMIT
TO A PSYCH EVAL,

19:20.927 --> 19:22.929
ANGER MANAGEMENT,
A LOT OF HOOPS.

19:22.962 --> 19:26.466
- AND HE'LL TELL THEM
TO GO TO HELL.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.472
- DON'T ASK.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.374
- WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD
USE MORE BAD NEWS.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.476
TEAM DISTASIO JUST SWUNG
AN APPELLATE COURT REVIEW

19:36.509 --> 19:38.478
OF HIS BAIL.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.646
- GREAT.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.417
- MY CLIENT'S RELEASE ON BAIL

19:44.451 --> 19:47.920
IS THE FIRST ACT OF DUE PROCESS
SINCE THIS WHOLE CHARADE BEGAN.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.856
LET ME JUST SAY SOMETHING:

19:49.889 --> 19:50.823
THAT WE ARE QUITE CONFIDENT

19:50.857 --> 19:53.826
THAT ONCE THE D.A.'S OFFICE
BECOMES AWARE

19:53.860 --> 19:57.297
OF ITS WITNESS'S
SERIOUS CREDIBILITY ISSUES,

19:57.330 --> 19:59.532
THEY WILL DROP THE CHARGES.

19:59.566 --> 20:03.803
- NEVER FOR AN INSTANT HAVE I
DOUBTED MY HUSBAND'S INNOCENCE.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.472
HE HAS MANY ENEMIES

20:05.505 --> 20:08.841
WHO WILL STOP AT NOTHING
TO DISCREDIT HIM.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.447
[overlapping shouts]

20:24.991 --> 20:30.997
[overlapping shouts continue]

20:42.575 --> 20:44.544
- LOOK, I DON'T WANNA
STALK YOU, BUT...

20:44.577 --> 20:47.580
YOU KNOW, IF YOU NEED TO TALK,
I'M HERE.

20:50.517 --> 20:51.884
- HEY, LIV.
- HEY.

20:51.918 --> 20:52.985
- HEY, LIV.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.822
- HEY, SO...
HOW'D THE HAND-OFF GO?

20:55.855 --> 20:58.391
- SOME HOUSE ARREST.
THIS CAT'S GOT A SCREENING ROOM.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.559
- [scoffs]

20:59.592 --> 21:02.028
[low conversation]

21:02.061 --> 21:03.229
SO WHAT'S HER STORY?

21:03.262 --> 21:06.833
SHE MUST HAVE SOME HOOKS TO BE
TRANSFERRED HERE FROM ATLANTA.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.501
- SHE'S COOL.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.603
- TALKED TO ELLIOT?

21:10.637 --> 21:11.871
- NO.

21:11.904 --> 21:12.939
- GOOD NEWS.

21:12.972 --> 21:13.873
THE DNA CAME BACK.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.575
IT'S A MATCH FOR DISTASIO
AND THE VICTIM.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.410
- WELL, THAT PUTS HIM
IN THE ROOM.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.379
WHAT IS HE GONNA DO NOW,
PLEAD CONSENT?

21:19.412 --> 21:20.380
- OH, YEAH, HE WILL.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.881
IN HIS WORLD, SEX IS POWER.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.115
TO HIM IT WAS ALL
JUST A DANCE.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.552
SO WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THAT
ROOM, HE DOESN'T SEE IT AS RAPE.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.588
- ELLIOT'S PROBABLY AFRAID
TO TALK TO YOU, LIV.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.458
DOESN'T WANT YOU TO TRY
TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.993
- OUT OF WHAT?

21:34.026 --> 21:35.328
HE'S NOT GONNA QUIT.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.330
- HE SHOT A TEENAGE GIRL.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.466
HE MAY NOT EVER
WANNA PUT HIS GUN ON AGAIN.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.969
- YOU INVITE YOUR BOSS
FOR A DRINK?

21:43.002 --> 21:43.803
- HEY, MIKE, WHAT'S UP?

21:43.836 --> 21:48.074
- THOUGHT YOU
VETTED YOUR WITNESS.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.877
SHE'S IN IT FOR THE MONEY.
- NOT A CHANCE.

21:51.878 --> 21:52.945
- THAT'S THE LEDGER.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.581
THEY'LL PRINT ANYTHING
TO SELL PAPERS.

21:54.614 --> 21:55.848
- THEY GOT HER ON TAPE.

21:55.882 --> 21:56.949
- WHAT? WHO?

21:56.983 --> 22:00.520
- ANOTHER MAID AT THE HOTEL
JUST SOLD MIRIAM OUT.

22:09.896 --> 22:10.930
- [on tape]
THIS MAN THAT DID THIS TO ME,

22:10.963 --> 22:12.131
HE IS RICH.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.833
I CAN MAKE HIM PAY.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.902
HE HAD NO RIGHT.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.904
- I KNOW
SOME GOOD LAWYERS, EH?

22:17.937 --> 22:21.574
THEY WILL HOOK YOU UP
WITH A FAT CIVIL SUIT.

22:21.608 --> 22:24.411
- HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
I CAN GET?

22:24.444 --> 22:27.847
I WANT TO TAKE
MILLIONS FROM HIM.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.549
[beep]

22:29.582 --> 22:31.951
WHY IS THIS
IN THE NEWSPAPER?

22:31.984 --> 22:35.422
- BECAUSE YOUR COWORKER
TAPED YOU AND SOLD IT TO THEM.

22:35.455 --> 22:39.392
- I HAVE A RIGHT
TO MAKE THIS MAN PAY.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.861
HE IS RICH,
LIVING IN A MANSION,

22:41.894 --> 22:44.096
WHEN YOU TOLD ME
HE WOULD BE IN PRISON.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.966
- BUT NOW THE DEFENSE CAN SAY
THAT YOU WERE NOT RAPED,

22:46.999 --> 22:48.535
THAT THIS IS A SHAKEDOWN.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.002
- HE RAPED ME.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.940
- YOU PROMISED MISS CABOT
THAT THIS WASN'T ABOUT MONEY.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.614
HAVE YOU HIRED A LAWYER?

23:04.150 --> 23:07.153
TERRIFIC.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.128
- SO YOU THINK
SHE'S ANGLING FOR A PAYDAY?

23:16.162 --> 23:17.464
- SHE SAYS NO.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.899
BUT EXLEY'S TEAM
WILL CLAIM EXTORTION.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.968
- EVEN ON THE TAPE,
HER STORY OF THE RAPE

23:22.001 --> 23:24.003
IS CONSISTENT
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

23:24.036 --> 23:27.574
- THESE CASES ARE ABOUT
PERCEPTION, NOT REALITY.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.208
SHE'S COMPROMISED.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.044
- THEY'RE DIGGING UP
EVERYTHING THEY CAN ON HER.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.414
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

23:36.248 --> 23:42.455
[speaking Italian]

23:44.156 --> 23:45.858
- DETECTIVES, ANY PROGRESS?

23:45.892 --> 23:48.461
- ANOTHER G.E.T. OFFICIAL
WHO WON'T GO ON RECORD.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.229
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, ROLLINS?

23:50.262 --> 23:52.865
- WELL, TWO MONTHS AGO
IN BUENOS AIRES,

23:52.899 --> 23:55.602
A HOTEL MAID,
ISABEL CORTAZAR,

23:55.635 --> 23:58.170
TOLD HER BOSS THAT DISTASIO
PUSHED HER ONTO THE BED.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.006
STARTED TO ATTACK HER.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.240
ONLY STOPPED
WHEN SHE SCREAMED.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.075
- IS SHE WILLING TO TESTIFY?

24:03.109 --> 24:05.244
- WELL, I HAVEN'T REACHED HER
YET, BUT NEITHER HAVE THEY.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.479
I CHECKED.

24:06.513 --> 24:07.580
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, STAY ON IT.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.248
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU GET ANYTHING.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.050
- ALEX CABOT PLEASE?

24:11.083 --> 24:14.487
GOOD WORK, ROLLINS.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.126
- MOTION TO SUPPRESS,
YOUR HONOR.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.528
THE POLICE HAVE NO RECORD
OF THIS CRIME.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.862
THIS TESTIMONY IS PREJUDICIAL.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.597
- THE OTHER MAID'S
ACCUSATION OCCURRED

24:24.631 --> 24:26.499
WITHIN THE LAST SIX MONTHS
AND IS CONSISTENT

24:26.533 --> 24:27.667
WITH THE DEFENDANT'S M.O.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.168
- WHERE IS THIS MISS CORTAZAR?

24:29.201 --> 24:31.571
- WE'RE MAKING ARRANGEMENTS
TO FLY HER IN FROM BUENOS AIRES.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.606
- PRODUCE HER,
AND I'LL ALLOW HER TESTIMONY.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.974
ANYTHING ELSE?

24:35.007 --> 24:36.042
- YES, YOUR HONOR.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.978
I HAVE NOTARIZED
POLICE REPORTS

24:39.011 --> 24:40.880
FROM ABYEI PROVINCE,
SOUTH SUDAN.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.214
- WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

24:42.248 --> 24:44.984
- WHAT PART ABOUT SOUTH SUDAN
DIDN'T YOU HEAR?

24:45.017 --> 24:47.219
PROSECUTION'S WITNESS HAS A
CONVICTION FOR PROSTITUTION

24:47.253 --> 24:48.888
IN HER HOME COUNTRY.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.557
- THIS, IF IT'S
EVEN LEGITIMATE...

24:50.590 --> 24:51.558
- IT'S LEGITIMATE.

24:51.591 --> 24:52.525
- IS INFLAMMATORY

24:52.559 --> 24:54.160
AND IN CLEAR VIOLATION
OF THE RAPE SHIELD LAW.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.162
- AH, THE RAPE SHIELD LAW
HAS AN EXCEPTION

24:56.195 --> 25:00.199
IF THE CLAIMANT HAS A CONVICTION
WITHIN THE LAST THREE YEARS.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.170
- WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME?

25:04.203 --> 25:07.874
- BECAUSE I AM NOT
A PROSTITUTE.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.610
I WAS GANG-RAPED.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.545
THEY STILL HAVE MY HUSBAND'S
BLOOD ON THEM

25:12.579 --> 25:14.146
WHEN THEY ATTACK ME.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.883
I BEG THEM
TO KILL ME AFTER,

25:16.916 --> 25:18.985
BUT THEY SAID NO.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.888
THEY WANTED SOMETHING SWEET
TO COME BACK TO.

25:21.921 --> 25:25.892
I WENT TO THE POLICE.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.193
THEY CALL ME A WHORE.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.896
THEY SAY I BROKE SHARIA LAW,

25:29.929 --> 25:33.265
AND THEY WILL
STONE ME TO DEATH

25:33.299 --> 25:35.635
IN FRONT OF MY CHILDREN.

25:41.207 --> 25:45.144
- IS THERE ANYONE
WHO CAN CONFIRM THIS STORY?

25:45.177 --> 25:49.582
- THIS IS NOT A STORY.

25:49.616 --> 25:52.952
IT IS WHY I COME HERE.

25:52.985 --> 25:56.155
BUT YOU WILL BELIEVE

25:56.188 --> 25:59.191
WHAT YOU WILL BELIEVE.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.336
- THE MAID FROM BUENOS AIRES
JUST MOVED

26:10.369 --> 26:12.872
TO AN EXCLUSIVE GATED COMMUNITY
IN CORDOBA

26:12.905 --> 26:14.106
AND WON'T RETURN OUR CALLS.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.142
- FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

26:16.175 --> 26:19.612
MIRIAM SAYS THAT SHE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH...

26:19.646 --> 26:22.982
NOW, THAT SHE WAS A VICTIM
OF SHARIA LAW.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.316
- DOESN'T MATTER.

26:24.350 --> 26:27.186
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:27.219 --> 26:29.922
- I DON'T SEE A WIN HERE.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.192
- I DO.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.160
WHEN THE JURY
HEARS HER STORY,

26:34.193 --> 26:36.195
THEY ARE GONNA COME BACK GUILTY
ON ALL COUNTS.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.264
- SHE'S HEARTBREAKING,

26:38.297 --> 26:40.633
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.669
- OLIVIA.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.939
I BELIEVE HER.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.008
I HEARD THOUSANDS OF STORIES
JUST LIKE HERS

26:49.041 --> 26:50.042
WHEN I WAS IN AFRICA.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.178
- IT'S NOT GETTING THAT FAR.

26:52.211 --> 26:55.214
THE NEW D.A. WANTS
TO DROP THE CHARGES.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.057
- ALL I EVER HEARD ABOUT

27:05.091 --> 27:07.894
WAS HOW MIKE CUTTER
WAS A CRUSADER FOR JUSTICE.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.328
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

27:09.361 --> 27:11.397
- IF WE PRESS A CASE
THAT WE CAN'T WIN,

27:11.430 --> 27:12.264
WE JUST TELL THE NEXT VICTIM

27:12.298 --> 27:14.200
THAT SHE'S BETTER OFF
STAYING SILENT.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.902
- IF WE LET DISTASIO WALK,

27:15.935 --> 27:18.337
WE SEND A MESSAGE TO THE REST OF
THE WORLD THAT, IN NEW YORK,

27:18.370 --> 27:21.908
THE LAW DOESN'T APPLY
TO THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL.

27:21.941 --> 27:24.443
WE ARE HERE
TO EVEN THOSE SCALES,

27:24.476 --> 27:27.680
NOT CUT AND RUN.

27:41.393 --> 27:42.929
- THE PROSECUTION'S WITNESS
IS HIGHLY SUSPECT

27:42.962 --> 27:45.231
AND FRANKLY, I AM CONFIDENT
THAT THE EVIDENCE

27:45.264 --> 27:46.899
WILL VINDICATE MY CLIENT.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.901
- BUT SIR, HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT THIS TRIAL?

27:48.935 --> 27:52.138
[overlapping shouting]

27:56.743 --> 28:00.346
[overlapping questions]

28:03.750 --> 28:05.351
- I FIGHT HIM.

28:05.384 --> 28:09.221
HE SAY, IF I DON'T,
HE WILL HAVE ME FIRED.

28:09.255 --> 28:12.992
WHEN HE FINISH,
HE PUSH ME AWAY.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.362
I-I CRAWL
TO THE SINK AND...

28:19.131 --> 28:20.967
- IT'S OKAY.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.003
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

28:26.472 --> 28:29.441
- I SPIT IT OUT.

28:29.475 --> 28:32.378
IT TASTE LIKE POISON.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.213
- MISS DENG,
THE DEFENSE HAS SUGGESTED

28:34.246 --> 28:36.048
THAT YOU ARE IN THIS
FOR THE MONEY.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.416
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
PAID FOR SEX?

28:37.449 --> 28:39.986
- NO.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.187
I NEVER.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.957
- BUT YOU DO HAVE A CONVICTION
FOR PROSTITUTION IN THE SUDAN.

28:44.991 --> 28:48.060
- YES.

28:48.094 --> 28:51.097
- CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN
HOW THAT CAME ABOUT?

28:54.466 --> 28:58.070
- I WAS GANG-RAPE
BY SOLDIERS.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.139
12 OF THEM.

29:00.172 --> 29:03.943
THEY STILL HAVE
MY HUSBAND'S BLOOD ON THEM

29:03.976 --> 29:06.512
WHEN THEY ATTACK ME.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.921
- MISS DENG,

29:14.954 --> 29:19.358
I'M TRULY SORRY FOR ALL THAT
YOU'VE HAD TO GO THROUGH.

29:19.391 --> 29:22.428
TELL US ABOUT THE SOLDIERS
WHO GANG-RAPED YOU.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.330
HOW MANY WERE THERE AGAIN?

29:24.363 --> 29:26.132
- 12 OF THEM.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.034
- 12.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.535
AND BEFORE YOU CAME
TO THIS COUNTRY,

29:29.568 --> 29:31.337
YOU FILLED OUT
AN APPLICATION

29:31.370 --> 29:33.472
FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM,
IS THAT RIGHT?

29:33.505 --> 29:36.042
- YES.
- AND ON THAT APPLICATION,

29:36.075 --> 29:40.046
DID THEY ASK YOU IF YOU HAD EVER
BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY?

29:40.079 --> 29:41.080
- YES.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.181
- AND HOW DID YOU ANSWER?

29:42.214 --> 29:44.316
- I--

29:44.350 --> 29:46.218
- SO YOU LIED ON
A LEGAL DOCUMENT

29:46.252 --> 29:48.320
WHERE YOU HAD SWORN
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.926
- YES.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.062
- YES.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.930
JUST SO WE CAN BE CLEAR,

29:57.964 --> 30:00.032
YOU'RE NOT LYING ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED

30:00.066 --> 30:01.167
IN THAT HOTEL ROOM, ARE YOU?

30:01.200 --> 30:03.469
- NO, I AM NOT LYING.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.271
- SO IN FACT,
YOU ONLY LIED ONCE,

30:05.304 --> 30:08.374
UNDER OATH, TO THE GOVERNMENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

30:10.176 --> 30:13.145
WELL, I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.146
- OBJECTION!

30:14.180 --> 30:16.082
- WITHDRAWN.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.050
NO MORE QUESTIONS.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.255
- HEARD THEY BEAT HER UP
IN THERE PRETTY BAD.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.224
- SHE BROUGHT IT ON HERSELF.

30:25.257 --> 30:28.094
SHE LIED--REPEATEDLY.

30:28.127 --> 30:30.429
- SHE DID WHATEVER
SHE HAD TO DO TO GET ASYLUM.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.231
- MAYBE.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.934
HER TESTIMONY
ABOUT THE GANG RAPE...

30:34.967 --> 30:37.369
YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING
TO BE CONSISTENT.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.505
IT'S ANOTHER
TO QUOTE VERBATIM.

30:39.538 --> 30:43.943
- EVERYBODY'S
RIPPING INTO HER.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.311
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

30:45.344 --> 30:49.248
YOU TELLING ME YOU DON'T
THINK HE'S GOOD FOR IT?

30:59.158 --> 31:01.360
- THE WOMAN OFFERED HERSELF,

31:01.393 --> 31:04.363
AND FOOLISHLY, I OBLIGED.

31:04.396 --> 31:08.200
AFTER, SHE ASKED ME
FOR MONEY.

31:08.234 --> 31:12.504
- OH, AND HOW
DID YOU RESPOND?

31:14.506 --> 31:17.944
- I SAID I'M NOT ACCUSTOMED
TO PAYING.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.980
SHE BECAME UPSET.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.549
SHE SAID,
"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE."

31:23.582 --> 31:27.219
SHE TOLD ME THAT,
UNLESS I GIVE HER $10,000,

31:27.253 --> 31:29.088
SHE WILL SAY
THAT I RAPED HER.

31:29.121 --> 31:33.159
WELL, I TOLD HER
THAT, IN MY LIFE,

31:33.192 --> 31:38.097
MANY HAVE TRIED
TO BLACKMAIL ME,

31:38.130 --> 31:40.132
AND THIS WILL NOT STAND.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.237
I WAS COMING BACK FROM THE SPA
IN MY ROBE.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.339
I OPENED THE DOOR.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.208
SHE WAS THERE.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.542
- HOW DID SHE RESPOND?

31:50.576 --> 31:53.345
- SHE ASKED
IF SHE WAS DISTURBING ME.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.114
I SAID "NO.

31:55.147 --> 31:58.217
I WILL DRESS
IN THE OTHER ROOM."

31:58.250 --> 32:02.488
THEN...SHE OFFERED HERSELF
TO ME.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.357
- HAD YOU EVER MET
MISS DENG BEFORE?

32:05.391 --> 32:06.358
- NO.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.526
- DIDN'T YOU THINK
IT WAS ODD

32:07.559 --> 32:09.495
THAT A WOMAN
WHO YOU DIDN'T KNOW

32:09.528 --> 32:12.231
WHO IS 40 YEARS YOUR JUNIOR

32:12.264 --> 32:15.401
OFFERED HERSELF
TO YOU SO ABRUPTLY?

32:15.434 --> 32:17.436
- NO.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.372
WOMEN SEE POWER...

32:20.406 --> 32:22.208
AND THEY FIND IT ATTRACTIVE.

32:22.241 --> 32:23.575
- YOU MEAN THEY LIKE IT ROUGH.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.077
- OBJECTION.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.012
- SUSTAINED.

32:26.045 --> 32:29.748
- I ASK BECAUSE,
IN EVIDENCE 407 AND 408,

32:29.781 --> 32:33.019
THE JURY SAW PHOTOGRAPHS
OF MISS DENG'S BRUISED FOREARMS

32:33.052 --> 32:34.053
AND SCRAPED KNEES.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.188
DO YOU CONSIDER
THOSE INJURIES

32:36.222 --> 32:38.557
TO BE A NORMAL PART
OF CONSENSUAL SEX?

32:38.590 --> 32:43.262
- THE DANCE IS DIFFERENT
EVERY TIME.

32:45.397 --> 32:49.235
- THE JURY ALSO SAW,
IN EVIDENCE 409,

32:49.268 --> 32:52.038
A PHOTOGRAPH OF A SCRATCH
ON YOUR NECK.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.006
WAS MISS DENG
THE ONE WHO SCRATCHED YOU?

32:54.040 --> 32:55.774
- YES.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.510
- ALSO PART OF "THE DANCE"?

32:58.544 --> 33:00.512
- SHE WAS VERY PASSIONATE.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.348
- ARE YOU SURE SHE DIDN'T
GET THOSE INJURIES

33:02.381 --> 33:04.583
TRYING TO FIGHT YOU OFF?

33:04.616 --> 33:07.153
- I KNEW SHE DID NOT
WANT ME TO STOP.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.788
- YOU KNEW?

33:09.821 --> 33:12.124
HOW?

33:12.158 --> 33:13.759
- A MAN KNOWS.

33:13.792 --> 33:17.063
- DID SHE TELL YOU THAT?

33:17.096 --> 33:18.797
- NO.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.168
IT'S, UH, IN A WOMAN'S EYES.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.170
NO MATTER WHAT THE WORDS SAY.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.338
- EVEN IF THE WORD IS "NO"?

33:26.372 --> 33:28.140
EVEN IF SHE'S FIGHTING YOU?

33:28.174 --> 33:29.141
SCRATCHING YOU?

33:29.175 --> 33:30.209
EVEN IF SHE'S CALLING FOR HELP

33:30.242 --> 33:32.378
LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES AFTER
YOU'VE FLED YOUR ROOM,

33:32.411 --> 33:33.379
AFTER YOU RAPED HER.

33:33.412 --> 33:36.415
DID YOU SEE THAT IN HER EYES?

33:41.553 --> 33:43.789
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

33:43.822 --> 33:45.291
- MR. EXLEY.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.425
- WELL, YOUR HONOR,
I APOLOGIZE.

33:46.458 --> 33:49.228
WE JUST WERE MADE AWARE
THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS.

33:52.298 --> 33:54.266
- YOUR HONOR, THIS HAIL MARY
IS A BALD-FACED ATTEMPT

33:54.300 --> 33:56.068
TO SKIRT PROPER
DISCOVERY RULES.

33:56.102 --> 33:58.404
- WHY WASN'T THIS WITNESS,
MR. ACHOK, ON YOUR LIST?

33:58.437 --> 34:01.207
- WE ONLY RECENTLY BECAME AWARE
OF HIS EXISTENCE, YOUR HONOR.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.241
HE LIVES IN THE SUDAN.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.142
- YOU HAD TIME TO FLY HIM IN,

34:03.175 --> 34:04.776
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO INFORM US?

34:04.810 --> 34:05.744
- WE'RE DOING THAT NOW.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.379
YOU CAN TAKE AS LONG
AS YOU WANT TO VET HIM.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.181
WE CAN WAIT.

34:09.215 --> 34:11.517
- GIVEN THE RELEVANCE
OF THIS WITNESS'S TESTIMONY,

34:11.550 --> 34:13.585
I'M GOING TO ALLOW IT.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.358
- MR. ACHOK,

34:19.391 --> 34:22.561
YOU HELPED MIRIAM DENG
FILL OUT HER ASYLUM APPLICATION,

34:22.594 --> 34:23.795
IS THAT RIGHT?

34:23.829 --> 34:26.532
- OH, YES, AND MANY OTHERS.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.301
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET ASYLUM.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.470
WHEN I TOLD HER
WHAT MUST BE DONE,

34:31.503 --> 34:33.305
SHE WAS VERY GOOD,

34:33.339 --> 34:34.773
VERY NATURAL.

34:34.806 --> 34:35.907
- AND WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

34:35.941 --> 34:40.246
- THE BEST WAY TO GET
INTO THE U.S. IS TO BE RAPED.

34:40.279 --> 34:43.515
THE AMERICANS CRY SO HARD
WHEN THEY HEAR IT.

34:43.549 --> 34:45.451
THEY OPEN THEIR DOORS WIDE.

34:45.484 --> 34:48.187
- AND ON THE APPLICATION,
SHE SAID

34:48.220 --> 34:50.789
THAT SHE WAS GANG-RAPED
BY A DOZEN SOLDIERS.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.391
- THIS IS WHAT WE SAID.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.293
- "WE"?
- OH, YES.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.229
THERE'S MANY DEAD PARENTS
IN SUDAN,

34:57.263 --> 34:58.797
MANY RAPES.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.433
SHE TOLD ME ONE SOLDIER
HAD RAPED HER.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.901
I TOLD HER, "NO!

35:02.934 --> 35:04.436
"ONE DOZEN SOLDIERS.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.871
THIS IS BETTER."

35:05.904 --> 35:08.174
- AND THAT'S WHAT SHE SWORE TO
ON THE APPLICATION,

35:08.207 --> 35:09.007
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

35:09.040 --> 35:11.810
- YES.
WE PRACTICED FOR HER INTERVIEW,

35:11.843 --> 35:14.246
HOW TO SAY THINGS.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.614
SHE CRIED.

35:15.647 --> 35:19.185
SHE TELL THE STORY OF THE RAPE
BY THE SOLDIERS,

35:19.218 --> 35:21.387
SHE MAKE ME CRY ALMOST.

35:23.422 --> 35:27.926
- WAS MISS DENG GANG-RAPED
BY 12 SOLDIERS?

35:27.959 --> 35:29.528
- NO.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.230
THIS WAS A LIE.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.399
- I SEE.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.933
- YOUR WITNESS,
MISS CABOT.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.269
- IT IS YOUR TESTIMONY

35:37.303 --> 35:39.405
THAT YOU COACH PEOPLE
TO LIE FOR A LIVING.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.539
IS THAT CORRECT, MR. ACHOK?

35:40.572 --> 35:41.740
- YES.

35:41.773 --> 35:44.843
- HOW MUCH MONEY DID THE DEFENSE
PAY YOU TO TESTIFY TODAY?

35:44.876 --> 35:46.945
- PLEASE.
- NOTHING.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.013
NOT ONE PENNY.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.549
- IS THAT WHAT THEY COACHED YOU
TO LIE, MR. ACHOK?

35:50.582 --> 35:54.353
- YOUR HONOR...
- WITHDRAWN.

35:58.357 --> 36:00.592
- OLIVIA, ALL RAPE VICTIMS
LIE ABOUT SOMETHING.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.794
YOU KNOW THAT.
HOW MUCH THEY HAD TO DRINK,

36:02.828 --> 36:04.530
WHO THEY WERE WITH THE NIGHT
BEFORE, WHAT THEIR BOYFRIENDS--

36:04.563 --> 36:07.199
- SHE PICKED THE WRONG THING
TO LIE ABOUT.

36:07.233 --> 36:09.201
ONE LIE IS FINE, EVEN TWO,

36:09.235 --> 36:11.203
BUT ALEX,
THERE'S A PATTERN HERE.

36:11.237 --> 36:12.404
I MEAN, HOW MUCH DAMAGE CONTROL
CAN YOU DO?

36:12.438 --> 36:13.872
- OLIVIA,

36:13.905 --> 36:15.974
DO YOU THINK SHE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE RAPE?

36:16.007 --> 36:18.277
- YES.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.846
SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED TO HER
IN THAT ROOM.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.882
- THAT'S ALL I NEED TO HEAR.

36:26.985 --> 36:30.822
- MY HEART GOES OUT
TO THE ACCUSER.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.359
BUT SHE HAS MADE
A HABIT OF LYING...

36:33.392 --> 36:35.294
LYING ABOUT RAPE

36:35.327 --> 36:37.896
TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS.

36:37.929 --> 36:41.267
SHE LIED ABOUT RAPE TO COME
TO THIS COUNTRY,

36:41.300 --> 36:44.403
AND WHEN SHE SAW MR. DISTASIO,

36:44.436 --> 36:47.539
SHE SAW AN OPPORTUNITY.

36:47.573 --> 36:50.276
EITHER HE PAID UP

36:50.309 --> 36:53.312
OR SHE WOULD CRY RAPE.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.913
YOU HEARD HER ON TAPE.

36:54.946 --> 36:59.985
"WE COULD TAKE MILLIONS."

37:00.018 --> 37:01.553
TELL ME,

37:01.587 --> 37:04.290
HOW DOES THAT SMELL TO YOU?

37:06.592 --> 37:09.595
- MIRIAM DENG IS
NOT A PERFECT WITNESS,

37:09.628 --> 37:12.331
BUT HER LIFE HAS BEEN
LESS THAN PERFECT.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.466
SHE ENTERED THIS COUNTRY
ON A LIE,

37:14.500 --> 37:16.435
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
THE HORRIBLE TRUTH

37:16.468 --> 37:19.438
WASN'T ENOUGH
TO GRANT HER ASYLUM.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.807
IT TOOK A GREAT DEAL OF COURAGE

37:21.840 --> 37:23.809
FOR HER TO CONFRONT
THE MAN WHO RAPED HER...

37:23.842 --> 37:26.478
TO TELL HIM THAT, IN AMERICA,

37:26.512 --> 37:30.248
MONEY AND POWER DO NOT TILT
THE SCALES OF JUSTICE.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.553
MIRIAM DENG THOUGHT
HER NIGHTMARE HAD FINALLY ENDED

37:34.586 --> 37:37.423
WHEN SHE ENTERED
THIS COUNTRY.

37:37.456 --> 37:40.359
IT IS UP TO THE 12 OF YOU
TO SEE THAT, FOR ONCE,

37:40.392 --> 37:42.594
SHE GETS JUSTICE.

37:51.470 --> 37:55.441
- THE JURY IS TAKING SO LONG.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.976
IS THAT A GOOD SIGN?

37:58.009 --> 37:59.978
- WE DON'T--WE DON'T HAVE
TO WAIT HERE.

38:00.011 --> 38:03.014
- DO YOU THINK
THEY BELIEVE ACHOK?

38:07.853 --> 38:10.556
ANY LIE I TOLD,

38:10.589 --> 38:14.092
I DID IT SO MY SONS
COULD HAVE A BETTER LIFE.

38:14.125 --> 38:18.364
I NEVER LIE ABOUT
WHAT HE DID TO ME.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.334
- I UNDERSTAND.

38:22.368 --> 38:24.536
[knock at door]

38:24.570 --> 38:27.573
- JURY'S BACK.

38:34.613 --> 38:37.048
- ON THE COUNT OF RAPE
IN THE FIRST DEGREE,

38:37.082 --> 38:39.585
HAS THE JURY
REACHED A VERDICT?

38:39.618 --> 38:42.354
- YOUR HONOR, ON THE CHARGE
OF RAPE IN THE FIRST DEGREE,

38:42.388 --> 38:45.424
THE JURY REMAINS UNABLE
TO REACH A UNANIMOUS VERDICT.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.092
- VERY WELL.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.560
I ACCEPT YOUR VERDICT.

38:48.594 --> 38:52.864
ON COUNT TWO,
HAS THE JURY REACHED A VERDICT?

38:52.898 --> 38:54.866
- ON THE CHARGE OF ASSAULT
IN THE SECOND DEGREE,

38:54.900 --> 38:56.435
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT

38:56.468 --> 38:58.570
NOT GUILTY.

38:58.604 --> 39:00.439
- ORDER,
ORDER IN THE COURT.

39:00.472 --> 39:01.473
[pounds gavel]

39:03.609 --> 39:05.511
ON COUNT THREE,
WHAT SAY YOU?

39:05.544 --> 39:08.046
- ON THE CHARGE
OF UNLAWFUL IMPRISONMENT

39:08.079 --> 39:09.448
IN THE SECOND DEGREE,

39:09.481 --> 39:11.517
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT
GUILTY.

39:13.485 --> 39:15.654
- [speaking Italian]

39:19.891 --> 39:21.493
- [speaking Italian]

39:21.527 --> 39:23.529
- BAILIFF, PLEASE REMOVE
MR. DISTASIO.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.597
- ROBERTO, PLEASE.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.433
CONTROL YOURSELF.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.535
- [speaking Italian]

39:32.438 --> 39:35.441
- THE STATE OF NEW YORK
THANKS THE JURY FOR ITS SERVICE.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.676
WE'RE ADJOURNED.
[pounds gavel]

39:44.082 --> 39:47.453
- WE HANDED THE JURY A MESS
AND THEY SPLIT THE BABY.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.420
- HE'S GONNA APPEAL.

39:48.454 --> 39:52.090
CLAIM THAT THAT PERP WALK
WAS PREJUDICIAL.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.058
- WE'LL ALL TAKE A HIT.

39:53.091 --> 39:55.461
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WITH THIS JUDGE,

39:55.494 --> 39:58.864
HE'LL DO A YEAR AT RIKERS
FOR THE LESSER CHARGE.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.432
- GOT TO COME OVER
ON THE MAYFLOWER

40:00.466 --> 40:03.469
IN ORDER TO MAKE
A RAPE CHARGE STICK.

40:03.502 --> 40:04.603
- HOW'D SHE TAKE IT?

40:04.636 --> 40:06.438
- HARD.

40:08.574 --> 40:10.008
- LIV.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.514
- NICE WORKING WITH YOU.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.522
- I DON'T THINK THAT
SHE WAS LYING ABOUT BEING RAPED.

40:25.491 --> 40:28.093
- WOULD YOU
SHUT THE DOOR PLEASE?

40:38.504 --> 40:41.006
ELLIOT PUT HIS PAPERS IN.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.646
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.

40:51.883 --> 40:52.984
- HE'S EARNED IT.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.086
- AND THEN SOME.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.025
YOU WANNA TALK?

41:00.058 --> 41:03.094
- NO.

41:03.128 --> 41:06.031
- YOU WANNA TAKE A DAY?

41:09.935 --> 41:12.538
- I'M FINE.

41:12.571 --> 41:16.107
- LIV...

41:16.141 --> 41:18.644
I'M SORRY.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.024
- YOU OKAY?

41:33.058 --> 41:35.126
- YEAH.
- BE RIGHT THERE.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.629
GOT A TEN THIRTY-FOUR
ON WAVERLY.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.965
- [sighs]

41:39.998 --> 41:42.167
- FIN, TAKE ROLLINS.

41:42.200 --> 41:46.271
- NO, I'LL GO.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.139
GIVE ME FIVE,
AND WE'LL ROLL.
