00:01.346 --> 00:03.114
Previously on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.181 --> 00:04.782
Yeah, this is like
the real deal.

00:04.850 --> 00:06.951
18 chefs from
all over America

00:07.019 --> 00:09.453
arrived with a dream
of stardom...

00:11.423 --> 00:13.257
None of you are stars.

00:13.325 --> 00:14.392
But were quickly
brought down to earth.

00:14.459 --> 00:15.726
Are you scared?

00:15.794 --> 00:17.261
At signature dish...

00:17.329 --> 00:19.196
That is delicious.
Great job.

00:19.264 --> 00:20.364
Will made a good
first impression.

00:20.432 --> 00:21.532
Same bologna,
different bread.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.633
Carrie...

00:22.701 --> 00:24.235
Oh.
That is disgusting.

00:24.303 --> 00:25.937
And Steven...
What is that?

00:26.004 --> 00:27.505
Made an impact,
but not in a good way.

00:27.573 --> 00:29.440
This is like toenails
from a dinosaur.

00:29.508 --> 00:31.008
But the worst dish
belonged to Krupa.

00:31.076 --> 00:33.010
<i>Krupa, that is crap-a.</i>

00:33.078 --> 00:35.980
I'm so much better
than this.

00:36.048 --> 00:37.848
At the opening night
dinner service...

00:37.916 --> 00:39.483
Come on! I'm dying here!

00:39.551 --> 00:41.218
Krupa redeemed herself.

00:41.286 --> 00:42.887
Who cooked the Wellington?
Perfect.

00:42.955 --> 00:44.789
Whoo! Go team!

00:44.856 --> 00:45.990
But don't start peeing
your knickers now!

00:46.058 --> 00:47.258
Yes, Chef.

00:47.326 --> 00:49.093
Carrie and Elise butted heads.

00:49.161 --> 00:50.661
I got it.
No, I got it.

00:50.729 --> 00:51.596
This is my station.
Don't push me.

00:51.663 --> 00:53.431
What are you doing?

00:53.498 --> 00:55.266
<i>Well, I was gonna</i>
<i>cook it for you,</i>

00:55.334 --> 00:56.400
<i>because we're all</i>
<i>a team, right?</i>

00:56.468 --> 00:57.501
On the blue team...

00:57.569 --> 00:58.603
<i>Monterray, why are you</i>

00:58.670 --> 00:59.804
giving me garnish?
We haven't even sent

00:59.871 --> 01:00.805
the first table
appetizers!

01:00.872 --> 01:02.373
The men, unbelievably,

01:02.441 --> 01:04.007
sent no entrees out
to their diners...

01:04.075 --> 01:06.344
Shut it down.

01:06.411 --> 01:08.312
And lost the first
dinner service.

01:08.380 --> 01:10.915
Food service, my ass.

01:10.983 --> 01:12.683
Choosing nominees...

01:12.751 --> 01:14.552
I <i>am</i> irate.
<i>Shut up, dumpling.</i>

01:14.620 --> 01:17.254
Led to a major blowout
between Brendan and Paul.

01:17.322 --> 01:18.956
I will slap you
across the .

01:19.024 --> 01:20.891
Shut up, meatball.

01:20.959 --> 01:22.493
When it came time
to send someone home,

01:22.561 --> 01:23.995
the men nominated...
Steve.

01:24.062 --> 01:25.329
And...
Monterray.

01:25.397 --> 01:26.330
And Chef Ramsay

01:26.398 --> 01:27.765
added a nominee
of his own.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.433
Chino, step forward,
please.

01:29.501 --> 01:30.234
But in the end, it was...

01:30.302 --> 01:31.435
Steven.

01:31.503 --> 01:33.204
Who saw his dream

01:33.271 --> 01:35.439
of being head chef at BLT Steak
in New York City

01:35.507 --> 01:37.642

This is nonsense.

03:12.589 --> 03:14.390

Chef Ramsay wants
the chefs up early,

Mm-hmm.

04:37.982 --> 04:39.883
I'm always ready

04:39.951 --> 04:41.651
Well, on the back of
the last performance,

04:41.719 --> 04:43.520
last service,
I've had nightmares.

<i>Okay. Well, I thought</i>

<i>Or, more importantly,</i>
<i>a return back to basics.</i>

04:49.861 --> 04:51.461
<i>And nothing</i>
<i>can be more basic</i>

04:51.529 --> 04:54.531
than being a master
at meat temperatures.

04:54.599 --> 04:56.366
<i>For me,</i>
<i>this is a chance to see</i>

04:56.434 --> 04:58.635
who's strong enough
to become the head chef

04:58.703 --> 05:00.737
of BLT Steak
in Manhattan.

05:00.805 --> 05:02.339
<i>Time for your challenge.</i>

05:02.406 --> 05:04.141
<i>You'll be working</i>
<i>in teams of two,</i>

05:04.208 --> 05:06.843
<i>and each pair</i>
<i>will have to prepare</i>

05:06.911 --> 05:09.179
a stunning medium-rare
New York strip,

05:09.247 --> 05:11.848
a medium rib eye,
a medium-well filet,

05:11.916 --> 05:14.017
and a well-done burger.
And, Will...

05:14.085 --> 05:15.952
<i>Because you're</i>
<i>one person short,</i>

05:16.020 --> 05:17.954
<i>you're gonna be manning</i>
<i>the grill on your own.</i>

05:18.022 --> 05:19.289
You do not wanna lose
this challenge, trust me.

05:19.357 --> 05:20.490
Hell, yes.

05:20.558 --> 05:21.691
I know I can cook meat.

05:21.759 --> 05:23.226
I'm definitely confident

05:23.294 --> 05:25.428
in going up against
anybody here.

05:25.496 --> 05:26.930
Got it?
Yes, Chef.

05:26.998 --> 05:29.032
Now, I've given you all
20 minutes...

05:29.100 --> 05:31.101
Starting from...Now.

05:31.169 --> 05:33.069
Find a grill.
Let's go.

05:33.137 --> 05:34.735
After an opening-night meltdown,

05:34.736 --> 05:37.603
Chef Ramsay has selected
this back-to-basics challenge

05:37.604 --> 05:39.605
in which the chefs
must work in pairs

05:39.673 --> 05:42.141
and grill four cuts of meat
to specific temperatures--

05:42.209 --> 05:44.110
a medium-rare
New York strip,

05:44.177 --> 05:46.879
medium rib eye,
medium-well filet,

05:46.947 --> 05:48.781
and a well-done burger.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.050
Don't do that.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.985
Just let it chill
for a minute.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.721
Oh, my God. The mere sight
of Carrie irritates me.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.124
Dang, back up
off my arm, dog!

05:58.191 --> 05:59.325
The bitch won't let me
do .

05:59.392 --> 06:02.428
Watch out. Get off.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.330
Ugh, God,
I just wanna--ugh!

06:04.397 --> 06:06.198
Will you stop it
already?

06:06.266 --> 06:07.299
While sparks
are already flying

06:07.367 --> 06:08.234
between Elise and Carrie...

06:08.301 --> 06:09.568
You're so ridiculous.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.470
Jonathon and Brendan...

06:11.538 --> 06:13.139
Only thing that's missing
is a beer cooler and .

06:13.206 --> 06:14.306
I know.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.509
Are completely laid-back.

06:16.576 --> 06:18.144
I know it's early,
but ,

06:18.211 --> 06:19.678
you know, every time
you fire up the grill,

06:19.746 --> 06:20.980
you wanna grab a beer
and, you know...
Exactly.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.149
Men absolutely have
an advantage over women

06:23.216 --> 06:24.416
over the grill.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.085
Ever since
we were cavemen,

06:26.153 --> 06:27.386
we've been roasting
Woolly Mammoths

06:27.454 --> 06:28.654
over the open flame.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.189
We're definitely
gonna kick ass.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.190
Ten minutes left!
Let's go!

06:31.258 --> 06:32.691
How's that filet?

06:32.759 --> 06:34.260
It can stay on
the lot.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.228
Oh, yeah, we're not even
close on that, bro.

06:36.296 --> 06:37.963
While the pairs continue

06:38.031 --> 06:39.632
to frantically work
their meat...

06:39.699 --> 06:41.500
We should've threw
that one on last.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.002
Will, the only chef
working as a solo...

06:43.069 --> 06:44.170
<i>Will, are you done?</i>

06:44.237 --> 06:45.638
Letting 'em rest, Chef.

06:45.705 --> 06:47.239
Has a more hands-off approach.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.708
You're letting 'em rest.
Wow, will is done.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.077
Step on that
flame-broiled piece

06:52.145 --> 06:53.679
<i>of mmm, mmm, mmm.</i>

06:53.747 --> 06:55.414
10 seconds to go.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.416
<i>9, 8, 7...</i>

6, 5, 4, 3,

07:01.922 --> 07:03.389
2, 1, and stop.

07:03.456 --> 07:04.757
Awesome.

07:04.824 --> 07:06.792
Yeah, that's
gonna be nice.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.494
Let's see which team

07:08.562 --> 07:11.363
has nailed
their temperatures

07:11.431 --> 07:12.965
to perfection, yes?

07:13.033 --> 07:14.667
<i>Let's start with</i>
<i>Amanda and Krupa.</i>

07:14.734 --> 07:16.735
Let's go, please.

07:16.803 --> 07:19.672
Okay,
who cooked the New York?

07:19.739 --> 07:21.740
We both did.
On all the meats.
We both did, Chef.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.742
Medium-rare, yes?
Yes, Chef.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.311
If we don't win today,

07:25.378 --> 07:27.413
somebody might strangle
somebody else.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.948
We have to win.

07:29.015 --> 07:30.583
You cooked it...

07:30.650 --> 07:32.585
Medium-rare.
That's perfect.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.720
Krupa and Amanda
have the red team

07:34.788 --> 07:35.888
off to a good start.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.223
<i>Okay.</i>

07:37.290 --> 07:38.557
Their next steak...

07:38.625 --> 07:39.825
The rib eye...
Is absolutely perfect.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.094
Whoo!

07:42.162 --> 07:43.329
Next is the filet mignon.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.697
Medium-well filet.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.267
And it is medium-well.
Great sear.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.236
And if their burger
is well-done,

07:50.303 --> 07:52.871
the ladies will receive
a perfect score.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.106
<i>Moist...</i>

07:54.174 --> 07:55.274
And well-done.

07:55.342 --> 07:56.508
Good job.
Four for four.

07:56.576 --> 07:57.743
Whoo!

07:57.811 --> 07:59.645
That was perfect.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.680
I would've kissed Amanda
on the lips

08:01.748 --> 08:03.015
if we hadn't all
not brushed our teeth.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.116
Hell, yeah!

08:04.184 --> 08:05.718
Brendan, Jonathon,
let's go.

08:05.785 --> 08:07.119
With an outstanding start

08:07.187 --> 08:08.754
by the ladies,
the pressure now shifts

08:08.822 --> 08:10.089
to Memphis head cook
Jonathon...

08:10.156 --> 08:11.790
Okay...

08:11.858 --> 08:13.325
And New Jersey
head chef Brendan.

08:13.393 --> 08:16.061
New York strip.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.663
That is not medium-rare.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.799
Rib eye.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.335
That is perfect.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.004
Beautiful rib eye, man.

08:25.071 --> 08:27.239
It was like flowers
blooming and .

08:27.307 --> 08:29.341
The filet, I asked for
medium-well,

08:29.409 --> 08:30.843
and it is perfect.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.979
The burger. Damn.

08:34.047 --> 08:37.216
I'm not even gonna cut it.
Just feel that.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.251
<i>I mean, it's like one</i>
<i>of those joke turds</i>

08:39.318 --> 08:40.486
<i>that you stick on</i>
<i>your granny's chair.</i>

08:40.553 --> 08:41.820
Really, dude?

08:41.888 --> 08:43.856
We're all supposed to be
professionals.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.190
I would imagine and hope that
people know how to cook meat.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.258
Piss off.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.694
Okay, Carrie, Elise.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.496
With the score
four to two for the ladies...

08:50.563 --> 08:51.730
<i>Let's go!</i>

08:51.798 --> 08:53.232
Pittsburgh line cook Elise

08:53.300 --> 08:54.633
and pantry chef
from Dallas Carrie

08:54.701 --> 08:56.502
are eager to extend
the red team's lead.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.170
The New York strip...

08:58.238 --> 09:00.306
That's not medium-rare.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.274
That's rare.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.543
It was Carrie's fault.
She was just standing there

09:04.611 --> 09:06.979
bitching and complaining
when she should've been serious

09:07.047 --> 09:08.280
about the challenge.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.082
<i>Rib eye.</i>
<i>Who cooked that?</i>

09:10.150 --> 09:11.483
I did, Chef.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.420
<i>That's not medium.</i>
<i>That's medium-rare.</i>

09:14.487 --> 09:16.855
Elise cooked every one
of those steaks.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.057
Every one of 'em.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.458
Zero for two.

09:19.526 --> 09:20.826
Not impressive
at all.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.227
I agree, Chef.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.229
Okay,
medium-well filet.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.231
Is it medium-well?

09:27.367 --> 09:29.001
It's medium-well.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.436
All right, ladies!

09:30.503 --> 09:31.870
The burger.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.972
Gray and dry.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.808
Not happy with that.
One out of four.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.810
<i>Dear, oh, dear.</i>
<i>Come on, ladies.</i>

09:37.877 --> 09:40.112
You should not be here

09:40.180 --> 09:44.083
if you can only temp one
out of four pieces of meat.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.951
<i>Right, next up.</i>

09:46.019 --> 09:47.419
The men are now
trailing by three.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.355
Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

09:49.422 --> 09:50.522
But Pennsylvania
executive chef Chino...

09:50.590 --> 09:51.890
Perfect.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.359
And New York line cook Tommy

09:53.426 --> 09:54.626
quickly close the gap.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.295
Medium-rare...
It is.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.430
<i>Three out of four.</i>
<i>Good job.</i>

09:58.498 --> 10:00.165
Tying the score at five.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.101
Good job, fellas.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.869
Next up, sous chefs
Jamie and Natalie...

10:03.937 --> 10:05.838
Medium-rare.
Excellent.

10:05.905 --> 10:07.339
Medium-well.
Beautiful.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.641
Well-done
and still juicy--good job.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.810
Earn three more points
for the red team.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.279
I'm here to win.
We haven't left Hell's Kitchen.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.181
It's time to win a challenge
and get the hell out of here.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.117
Paul and Monterray,
let's go.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.618
While Pennsylvania
line cook Monterray...

10:19.686 --> 10:21.587
Medium-rare.
Perfect.

10:21.654 --> 10:23.422
And Florida
junior sous Chef Paul...

10:23.490 --> 10:24.757
It is medium-well.

10:24.824 --> 10:26.158
Thank you, Chef.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.826
Well-done
doesn't mean cremated.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.928
Only get two of their four

10:29.996 --> 10:31.263
meat temperatures correct.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.265
Disappointing.
Sorry.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.900
Okay, ladies,
you have eight.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.336
Men, seven.
It's close. Let's go.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.838
With the men
trailing by just one point,

10:39.906 --> 10:42.574
Jennifer, Gina,
and Elizabeth

10:42.642 --> 10:44.076
could win the competition
for the women

10:44.144 --> 10:45.511
with a perfect score.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.346
If the ladies get
all of these right,

10:47.414 --> 10:48.347
<i>they clinch the deal.</i>

10:48.415 --> 10:51.016
Now, New York strip,

10:51.084 --> 10:53.218
I asked for
medium-rare.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.621
Medium-rare.

10:55.688 --> 10:56.922
Whoo!

10:56.990 --> 10:58.557
Nice.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.893
Rib eye.
I asked for medium.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.227
You cooked it...

11:04.798 --> 11:07.099
Medium-rare.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.401
Damn! No!

11:09.469 --> 11:11.603
With an incorrect temperature
on the rib eye...

11:11.671 --> 11:13.172
It's not medium-well.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.407
And the filet...
Damn!

11:15.475 --> 11:18.076
The ladies fail
to close out the competition.

11:18.144 --> 11:20.479
The burger.
I asked for well-done.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.448
A nice color on it.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.818
A great sear,
and the burger's moist.

11:25.885 --> 11:29.321
Beautiful, beautiful.
Absolutely beautiful.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.524
The scores are ten to ladies,
seven to the guys.

11:32.592 --> 11:33.759
<i>Okay, will, let's go.</i>

11:33.827 --> 11:35.127
Come on, Will!

11:35.195 --> 11:36.428
If you get all four right,
you win.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.130
We're doomed.
It's ten-seven.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.232
The only guy that
we have left is Will,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.968
and everybody was having
problems with the burgers today.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.370
Okay.
New York strip.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.873
I asked for
medium-rare.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.644
And it is medium-rare.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.279
Beautiful.
Good job.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.281
<i>Ten, eight.</i>

11:56.349 --> 11:57.783
Okay, that's one.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.284
He's got three more
cuts of meat.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.419
He's gonna
up one.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.254
Rib eye.
I asked for medium.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.022
Please,
please up.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.457
Please.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.929
Medium it is.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.831
<i>Perfect.</i>

12:12.899 --> 12:15.267
Next one
is for the tie.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.370
<i>The filet I asked for</i>
<i>a medium-well.</i>

12:18.438 --> 12:21.139
<i>You cooked it...</i>

12:21.207 --> 12:23.442
Medium-well.
Perfect.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.611
Good job, boys,
good job.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.046
Ladies, ten,
gentlemen, ten.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.582
Now it's all down...
to one burger.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.818
Bye-bye, girls.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.186
Bye-bye.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.821
So far, the men
have fallen short

12:35.889 --> 12:36.788
<i>of cooking a burger</i>
<i>well-done.</i>

12:36.856 --> 12:38.357
Come on, Chef.
Like, come on.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.992
There has to be
something wrong

12:40.059 --> 12:41.727
with one piece of meat
of his.

12:46.165 --> 12:47.432
You cooked the burger...

12:52.664 --> 12:53.964
The back-to-basics
grilling challenge

12:54.032 --> 12:54.998
is all tied up.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.733
Now it's all down...
To one burger.

12:57.803 --> 12:59.904
And the blue team's fate

12:59.972 --> 13:01.873
rests squarely on
Jersey City sous chef Will.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.574
So far the men
have fallen short

13:03.642 --> 13:05.042
of cooking a burger
well-done.

13:10.883 --> 13:13.918
You cooked the burger...

13:13.986 --> 13:15.820
Perfect.

13:15.888 --> 13:17.555
That's what
I'm talking about.

13:17.623 --> 13:19.257
I play to win.
Perfect or nothing.

13:19.324 --> 13:21.926
Congratulations.
The men win four for four.

13:21.994 --> 13:23.261
I'm pissed.

13:23.328 --> 13:25.029
Carrie and Elise
just killed us.

13:25.097 --> 13:27.031
They got one out of
four pieces of meat.

13:27.099 --> 13:29.133
It shouldn't have happened.

13:29.201 --> 13:31.702
Men, congratulations.
Great job.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.704
Good job, fellas.
Good job.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.506
We was all
running around,

13:35.574 --> 13:36.808
hugging like girls
at band camp.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.509
Everybody's
starting to bond,

13:38.577 --> 13:39.977
and that's what
it's all about right now.

13:40.045 --> 13:41.579
Right,
for winning,

13:41.647 --> 13:45.249
my God, have I got
a great reward for you.

13:45.317 --> 13:46.617
Palm Springs!

13:46.685 --> 13:48.920
What?
Oh, yes!

13:48.987 --> 13:51.322
Whoo!
Palm Springs, baby!

13:51.390 --> 13:52.790
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

13:52.858 --> 13:55.092
A little R&R.
Man, it feels good to win.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.594
Get ready,

13:56.662 --> 13:59.597
because our private jet
takes off in about 40 minutes.

13:59.665 --> 14:00.631
Are you
kidding me?

14:00.699 --> 14:01.699
What?

14:01.767 --> 14:03.000
So get upstairs.

14:03.068 --> 14:04.502
Thank you.
Let's go, guys!

14:04.570 --> 14:06.003
Baller status.
I'm a big deal,

14:06.071 --> 14:07.572
and big deals get
private planes.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.907
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.109
<i>Ladies, you had it</i>
<i>in your grasp.</i>

14:12.177 --> 14:15.780
You were three points
in front of the men.

14:15.848 --> 14:17.481
<i>Elise and Carrie,</i>

14:17.549 --> 14:20.251
<i>you guys screwed it</i>
<i>for your team,</i>

14:20.319 --> 14:22.186
<i>and you're gonna have</i>
<i>a very miserable,</i>

14:22.254 --> 14:23.888
<i>drawn-out day.</i>

14:23.956 --> 14:26.891
I want my grills back
to spotless condition.

14:26.959 --> 14:28.359
<i>And then later,</i>

14:28.427 --> 14:30.261
we have a unique
meat delivery coming.

14:30.329 --> 14:32.196
<i>I've got</i>
<i>a plane to catch.</i>

14:32.264 --> 14:33.264
<i>Uh, happy cleaning.</i>

14:35.334 --> 14:36.901
I'm pissed at Elise.

14:36.969 --> 14:39.537
By one damn point.

14:39.605 --> 14:41.706
You're gonna let your ego
get in your way

14:41.773 --> 14:43.207
so that you it up
for the whole team?

14:43.275 --> 14:44.342
Guess what?
Your ass is gonna be

14:44.409 --> 14:45.743
the first one
on the chopping block.

14:45.811 --> 14:47.245
If she would've been
your partner, too,

14:47.312 --> 14:48.479
<i>you'd have been</i>
<i>pissed off.</i>

14:48.547 --> 14:49.881
<i>Like, she never</i>
<i>shuts up.</i>

14:49.948 --> 14:52.083
This blows.

14:52.150 --> 14:53.918
She gets
on my last nerve.

14:53.986 --> 14:55.920
And I get along
with everybody.

14:55.988 --> 14:58.222
Elise gets
such a bad attitude

14:58.290 --> 15:00.458
about absolutely
everything.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.860
It's bringing
the whole team down.

15:02.928 --> 15:05.630
Shut up and do
what you're here to do,

15:05.697 --> 15:06.831
which is cook.

15:06.899 --> 15:08.633
I mean, even just
to look at her

15:08.700 --> 15:10.668
<i>makes me</i>
<i>wanna sock her.</i>

15:10.736 --> 15:12.803
While the women
are already a team divided,

15:12.871 --> 15:14.672
the men are united
and are ready to take off

15:14.740 --> 15:15.640
for Palm Springs.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.141
Let's go, guys.

15:17.209 --> 15:18.509
Come on, Brendan.

15:18.577 --> 15:20.177
I'm going
to Palm Springs, bitch.

15:20.245 --> 15:21.412
We jumped
on the private plane,

15:21.480 --> 15:22.914
right up in the air.

15:22.981 --> 15:24.916
I think I can see
Hell's Kitchen from here.

15:24.983 --> 15:26.817
Holy .

15:26.885 --> 15:28.452
I got a little
fear of flying.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.187
I thought I was gonna
myself.

15:30.255 --> 15:31.555
He can cook temperatures perfectly.
Right.

15:31.623 --> 15:33.791
But he can't fly.
Can't fly.

15:33.859 --> 15:36.260
We touched down
in Palm Springs....

15:36.328 --> 15:37.428
Whoa!
There it is!

15:37.496 --> 15:38.763
We get to the tram,

15:38.830 --> 15:40.331
and every one
of our jaws

15:40.399 --> 15:41.766
was bottomed out, man.

15:41.833 --> 15:44.135
<i>Look at the view.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

15:44.202 --> 15:46.304
<i>Look at that.</i>

15:46.371 --> 15:47.972
Now, this is amazing.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.707
<i>I've never seen</i>
<i>anything like this.</i>

15:49.775 --> 15:51.475
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>this is pretty crazy.</i>

15:51.543 --> 15:53.044
<i>There we go. Excellent.</i>

15:53.111 --> 15:54.412
It was absolutely
incredible.

15:54.479 --> 15:56.280
Oh, my gosh.

15:56.348 --> 15:58.015
Welcome to the Top
of Palm Springs.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.084
Now, that's
a proper view, yes?

16:00.152 --> 16:01.752
<i>Can we just spare</i>
<i>a thought</i>

16:01.820 --> 16:03.621
for the girls back in HK?
30 seconds.

16:03.689 --> 16:05.790
<i>Sucks to be you.</i>

16:05.857 --> 16:07.058
<i>Hear hear!</i>

16:07.125 --> 16:09.126
Great job, guys.

16:09.194 --> 16:10.928
While the men
enjoy a taste of paradise,

16:10.996 --> 16:14.632
the women are about to get
a taste of something else.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.101
Chef Andi comes out
with a blender.

16:17.169 --> 16:19.904
I'm thinking we're, like,
having a little cocktail.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.774
Since we had
a lot of meat,

16:23.842 --> 16:25.142
<i>we don't want this</i>
<i>to go to waste,</i>

16:25.210 --> 16:26.377
so we'll drink
our lunch.

16:26.445 --> 16:28.312
Oh, my God.

16:28.380 --> 16:30.514
No, no, no, no!

16:30.582 --> 16:32.550
I'm scared.

16:32.617 --> 16:36.020
The texture was ungodly.

16:36.088 --> 16:38.289
<i>Ugh-uh!</i>
<i>This is not gonna be good.</i>

16:38.357 --> 16:39.824
It was chunky.

16:39.891 --> 16:43.294
<i>There was sinew and fat.</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

16:43.362 --> 16:45.629
<i>If I throw up,</i>
<i>I'm killing everyone.</i>

16:45.697 --> 16:47.298
<i>Don't talk about it.</i>

16:47.366 --> 16:49.400
<i>Just drink it</i>
<i>and be done with it.</i>

16:49.468 --> 16:51.502
<i>Oh, my God. This is awful.</i>

16:51.570 --> 16:52.803
<i>Trash can.</i>
<i>Trash can.</i>

16:54.373 --> 16:56.907
To me, Carrie looked
like she was enjoying it.

16:59.878 --> 17:01.746
She's probably had plenty
of meat in her mouth.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.948
<i>Give me</i>
<i>the trashcan, Jamie.</i>

17:04.016 --> 17:05.449
<i>Look at</i>
<i>that meat moustache!</i>

17:07.319 --> 17:09.252
While the women
try to swallow

17:09.320 --> 17:11.589
a disappointing loss,
back in Palm Springs,

17:11.656 --> 17:14.224
the men get some quality time
with Chef Ramsay.

17:14.291 --> 17:15.593
This time, for me,
is a special time

17:15.660 --> 17:16.926
<i>to get to know you.</i>

17:16.994 --> 17:18.796
Monterray,
what is the ambition?

17:18.864 --> 17:20.964
<i>My ambition comes from</i>
<i>my family, my wife,</i>

17:21.032 --> 17:22.366
and my six kids.

17:22.434 --> 17:24.268
<i>Like, I do this</i>
<i>for them.</i>

17:24.336 --> 17:27.238
Monterray's got <i>six</i> kids.
That's a lot of kids.

17:27.305 --> 17:28.906
My father told me
when we were younger

17:28.974 --> 17:30.975
that every generation,

17:31.043 --> 17:32.643
<i>you need to step up</i>
<i>the family's name,</i>

17:32.711 --> 17:34.678
and, uh, I take that
very seriously.

17:34.746 --> 17:37.081
Chef Ramsay got to know us more
on a personal level,

17:37.149 --> 17:38.949
he got to know
what's driving us.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.518
That took Chef Ramsay

17:40.585 --> 17:43.721
from being some
bad-ass chef in a kitchen

17:43.789 --> 17:45.790
to normal human being.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.258
Brendan.

17:47.325 --> 17:50.127
I come from
a very accomplished family

17:50.195 --> 17:53.564
of lawyers, doctors,
master's degrees,

17:53.632 --> 17:55.499
and always had the label
"potential" on me.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.868
And the first time
I ever made a meal

17:57.936 --> 18:01.639
and served it to my family,
they loved it, I mean <i>loved.</i>

18:01.706 --> 18:03.307
<i>It was</i>
<i>simple roast turkey.</i>

18:03.375 --> 18:04.608
Aunts and uncles thought
that I was just amazing.

18:04.676 --> 18:06.177
<i>I made</i>
<i>Thanksgiving dinner.</i>

18:06.244 --> 18:07.578
<i>My parents were like,</i>
<i>"oh, my God.</i>

18:07.646 --> 18:09.246
Look what he can do,"
and my eyes lit up.

18:09.314 --> 18:10.414
This is what I wanna do
for the rest of my life.

18:10.482 --> 18:11.449
<i>It just dawned on me</i>
<i>there.</i>

18:11.516 --> 18:13.117
It was, like,
potential realized.

18:13.185 --> 18:14.385
Wow.

18:14.453 --> 18:16.353
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah,

18:16.421 --> 18:17.922
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

18:17.989 --> 18:19.356
Shut up, man.

18:19.424 --> 18:21.859
There's a journey
that you've gotta go on,

18:21.927 --> 18:23.828
<i>and every service,</i>
<i>you've got to get better.</i>

18:23.895 --> 18:25.563
<i>So you gotta</i>
<i>get your game face.</i>

18:25.630 --> 18:27.431
Bring that experience now back,
and now the next service.

18:27.499 --> 18:29.500
You guys couldn't get
an entree out.

18:29.568 --> 18:31.235
<i>We've just been served three</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

18:31.303 --> 18:32.870
<i>Thanks for rubbing salt</i>
<i>into the wound.</i>

18:32.938 --> 18:33.804
While the guys
enjoy Chef Ramsay's company

18:33.872 --> 18:35.005
outside the restaurant,

18:35.073 --> 18:36.307
back in Hell's Kitchen...

18:38.944 --> 18:40.845
The ladies are about
to get intimate

18:40.912 --> 18:43.514
with a beefy
Hell's Kitchen delivery.

18:43.582 --> 18:44.982
I knew there was
gonna be a cow.

18:45.050 --> 18:46.450
I knew it!

18:46.518 --> 18:49.620
Oh, my God, dude.
Like, really?

18:49.688 --> 18:51.655
You guys, we don't want this
to drop on the floor,

18:51.723 --> 18:54.692
so make sure
it's a team effort, okay?

18:56.428 --> 18:58.195
We're gonna lose it
down here in the back.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.430
I know. I'm afraid
I should be in the back.

18:59.498 --> 19:00.965
Come on.
I got it.

19:01.032 --> 19:02.266
Come on, come on,
come on.

19:02.334 --> 19:03.834
Oh, my God.
All right.

19:03.902 --> 19:07.204
That cow
was heavy.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.839
I'm slipping.

19:08.907 --> 19:10.341
I'm slipping too.

19:10.408 --> 19:12.743
I get a cow's leg
on my shoulder.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.648
And it was absolutely
a cluster.

19:17.716 --> 19:19.783
So, um--so your knife kits
are right under there.

19:19.851 --> 19:21.685
We'll just start cutting away.

19:21.753 --> 19:22.987
So now we
have to cut that meat.

19:24.656 --> 19:26.524
That's how I feel
about the punishment.

19:26.591 --> 19:28.692
Yeah, we just gotta, like,
lean as hard as we can,

19:28.760 --> 19:31.061
but once it snaps,
it snaps.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.329
I got all
my weight on it.

19:32.397 --> 19:33.597
It's okay.
It's okay.

19:33.665 --> 19:35.032
Just taking out
my aggressions

19:35.100 --> 19:36.233
for the whole day
on this cow.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.535
This is, like, awesome.

19:37.602 --> 19:39.236
I feel like I'm, like,
right there.

19:40.972 --> 19:42.106
You guys are.

19:42.174 --> 19:43.707
We're almost there,
guys. Yeah!

19:43.775 --> 19:45.342
Freedom.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.077
I don't know if that's
my blood or the cow's.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.078
I'm just kidding.
It's the cow's.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.714
Whoo!
Way to go, ladies!

19:55.787 --> 19:57.855
All right, so let's continue
our verbage, ladies.

19:57.923 --> 20:00.558
<i>This'll help us.</i>
<i>The confit potatoes?</i>

20:00.625 --> 20:02.326
Confit potatoes
are in butter.

20:02.394 --> 20:04.161
No, they're in oil,
because they're "confit."

20:04.229 --> 20:05.496
Yeah.

20:05.564 --> 20:07.131
Even though we have been
working all day,

20:07.199 --> 20:09.700
we have all been studying
our asses off!

20:09.768 --> 20:11.168
We are not
gonna lose service.

20:11.236 --> 20:12.970
Beef Wellington.
Scoring it,

20:13.038 --> 20:14.572
and we're brushing it
with egg.

20:14.639 --> 20:16.240
<i>What's in</i>
<i>the egg mixture?</i>

20:16.308 --> 20:18.676
Um...
I don't know.

20:18.743 --> 20:20.377
Okay, that's what
I'm saying.

20:20.445 --> 20:22.112
This is good practice.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.181
I don't wanna lose
another challenge,

20:24.249 --> 20:26.150
but I don't feel like this
will give us a disadvantage,

20:26.218 --> 20:28.285
because while
the men are off drinking,

20:28.353 --> 20:30.788
they're not really thinking
about game time tomorrow.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.257
Guys, are you realizing
that the guys are being set up

20:33.325 --> 20:35.392
<i>for failure right now?</i>
Yeah, totally.

20:35.460 --> 20:36.794
Do you think they're gonna do
this when they get back?

20:36.861 --> 20:37.328
Hell, no.

20:39.598 --> 20:40.698
What, you get
a couple beers?

20:40.765 --> 20:42.233
No--yeah, yeah.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.134
Despite a day of heavy labor,

20:44.202 --> 20:45.869
the women
are completely focused

20:45.937 --> 20:47.404
on doing whatever they can
to be ready

20:47.472 --> 20:48.672
for tomorrow night's
dinner service.

20:48.740 --> 20:49.807
<i>Appetizers--</i>

20:49.874 --> 20:51.108
crispy calamari.

20:51.176 --> 20:52.610
Yeah.

20:52.677 --> 20:54.345
Well, not all the women.

20:54.412 --> 20:55.746
You don't have
a boyfriend, do you?

20:55.814 --> 20:57.281
<i>Nope, no boyfriend.</i>

20:57.349 --> 20:58.616
I haven't had time
for boys.

20:58.683 --> 21:00.184
I'm too focused
on myself.

21:00.252 --> 21:02.253
Today was a very long day.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.854
I just wanted to have a glass
of wine and talk with Brendan,

21:03.922 --> 21:05.856
because I'm done
being punished.

21:05.924 --> 21:07.625
<i>I'm too selfish.</i>
<i>I focus on myself.</i>

21:07.692 --> 21:09.393
What happened to some
little Dallas loser

21:09.461 --> 21:10.327
that you broke his heart
or something?

21:10.395 --> 21:11.595
Oh, I've broke
many hearts.

21:11.663 --> 21:12.496
<i>I have no doubt.</i>

21:12.564 --> 21:14.331
Just like--

21:14.399 --> 21:15.966
I am not a prude.

21:16.034 --> 21:17.735
But, like, seriously,
what the is up?

21:17.802 --> 21:19.670
You don't know about me.
I'm evil.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.171
Oh, are you devious,
and evil, and stuff?

21:21.239 --> 21:22.439
<i>No way.</i>

21:22.507 --> 21:23.874
I don't see it
at all.

21:23.942 --> 21:25.342
What are you doing?

21:25.410 --> 21:26.577
I don't think
Carrie's priorities

21:26.645 --> 21:28.512
are in the right place.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.848
Are you not
gonna go to bed?

21:32.617 --> 21:34.151
You, too, baby.
Sweet dreams.
All right, now.

21:34.219 --> 21:35.452
You be good.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.987
I'll try.

21:37.055 --> 21:38.722
<i>Hey, Brendan!</i>

21:38.790 --> 21:40.057
Yes?

21:40.125 --> 21:41.859
<i>Come here for a sec.</i>

21:41.926 --> 21:42.926
Excuse me.

21:46.798 --> 21:47.731
You rang?

21:49.334 --> 21:51.235
I'm not getting
exercise here.

21:51.303 --> 21:52.936
Well, we'll figure out a way
for you to burn calories.

21:54.406 --> 21:56.840
What a stank-a-dank skank.

21:56.908 --> 21:57.808
Shh!

22:03.530 --> 22:04.553
Tonight <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>

22:04.554 --> 22:06.021
opens for the second time,

22:06.089 --> 22:07.556
and while both teams
get an early start on prep,

22:07.657 --> 22:09.458
the men seem confident.

22:09.526 --> 22:11.060
How's everybody
feeling, man?

22:11.128 --> 22:13.028
It's coming together.
I can feel it.

22:13.096 --> 22:14.463
Palm Springs
pulled team together.

22:14.531 --> 22:16.398
Now we're bringing
the A-game.

22:16.466 --> 22:19.081
The wolf pack is definitely
howling tonight.

22:19.082 --> 22:20.049
What's rocking, man?

22:20.117 --> 22:22.785
Whoo!

22:22.853 --> 22:24.620
Hell, yeah.

22:24.688 --> 22:27.156
While Jonathon
finds his inner wolf,

22:27.224 --> 22:29.759
Elise attempts
to organize the women.

22:29.827 --> 22:32.128
We need to break off in teams,
divide these recipes up,

22:32.196 --> 22:34.030
<i>and make sure we got everything</i>
<i>needed down the list.</i>

22:34.097 --> 22:35.464
Yeah.

22:35.532 --> 22:36.933
I think we may have
an advantage

22:37.000 --> 22:38.201
going into
service tonight

22:38.268 --> 22:40.436
because we all kept
studying our asses off.

22:40.504 --> 22:42.872
<i>Squab gets pea shoots, so</i>
<i>we have the wrong one on there.</i>

22:42.940 --> 22:45.374
Let's go, ladies!
Crank it up!

22:45.442 --> 22:47.844
<i>Move on to the next thing.</i>
<i>Let's go, ladies!</i>

22:47.911 --> 22:50.346
I had this amazing feeling
that we were gonna have

22:50.414 --> 22:51.881
such a good night tonight.

22:51.949 --> 22:53.616
We should go around
to every station

22:53.684 --> 22:54.884
<i>and label everything.</i>

22:54.952 --> 22:56.819
Yup, it's only gonna help.

22:56.887 --> 22:58.888
I think that it'll be
a turning point for us.

22:58.956 --> 23:00.056
Let's kick some ass.

23:02.492 --> 23:04.360
James.
<i>Yes, Chef?</i>

23:04.428 --> 23:06.996
Let's go. Open
Hell's Kitchen, please.

23:10.000 --> 23:18.441
♪ ♪

23:18.508 --> 23:20.276
Tonight,

23:20.344 --> 23:22.445
in order to take some
of the load off the kitchen,

23:22.512 --> 23:23.946
Chef Ramsay has chosen
two items from the menu

23:24.014 --> 23:25.248
to be served tableside.

23:27.551 --> 23:29.318
I'll have
the prime rib.

23:29.386 --> 23:30.753
Will and Carrie will be starting

23:30.821 --> 23:32.555
in the dining room,
making Caesar salads.

23:32.623 --> 23:34.657
And later,
Krupa and Monterray

23:34.725 --> 23:35.958
will be carving
prime rib.

23:36.026 --> 23:38.427
All right,
two pork chops.

23:38.495 --> 23:40.429
Okay, ladies,
here we go.

23:40.497 --> 23:42.331
We're gonna kick off
with the red team.

23:42.399 --> 23:43.366
Four couples, table one,
two Caesar salads,

23:43.433 --> 23:44.267
one scallop,
one brisket.

23:44.334 --> 23:45.468
Yes, Chef!

23:45.535 --> 23:46.769
Come on,
ladies, let's go.

23:46.837 --> 23:47.803
Said one brisket?

23:47.871 --> 23:49.906
One brisket,
or two briskets?

23:49.973 --> 23:51.707
I think it's one,
right?
Okay.

23:51.775 --> 23:53.542
The red team's
gotta win tonight.

23:53.610 --> 23:55.278
We have to prove that
we're meant to be here.

23:55.345 --> 23:56.312
Brisket salad.

23:56.380 --> 23:57.780
I know
we're gonna kick ass

23:57.848 --> 23:58.981
once we get goin'.

23:59.049 --> 24:00.082
It's squab.

24:00.150 --> 24:01.450
Uh-oh.

24:01.518 --> 24:03.185
There's squab in here.

24:03.253 --> 24:04.887
Unbelievable.
Who gave me the brisket?

24:04.955 --> 24:07.690
Taste that, Jennifer.
Come on.

24:07.758 --> 24:10.192
It's a long way away
from brisket.

24:10.260 --> 24:11.894
It's pigeon!
Yes, Chef.

24:11.962 --> 24:13.129
Come on!

24:13.196 --> 24:14.597
Oh, my God.

24:14.665 --> 24:17.133
Why did I mess up
the first salad?

24:17.200 --> 24:18.534
Aye-yi-yi.

24:18.602 --> 24:20.169
Shake it off,
shake it off.

24:20.237 --> 24:21.771
While Jennifer's attempt

24:21.838 --> 24:23.572
at the brisket salad
has gone afoul,

24:23.640 --> 24:25.308
over in the blue kitchen,

24:25.375 --> 24:27.576
Jonathon, Chino, and Brendan
are working hard

24:27.644 --> 24:29.312
to get out
their appetizers.

24:29.379 --> 24:30.746
<i>Caesar salad, risotto,</i>
<i>penne, scallop.</i>

24:30.814 --> 24:32.114
<i>Where are we?</i>

24:32.182 --> 24:33.683
Penne walking.
Penne up.

24:33.750 --> 24:35.384
Where's the risotto?

24:35.452 --> 24:38.721
<i>Chino, how long?</i>

24:38.822 --> 24:40.256
How long out
on the risotto?

24:43.093 --> 24:44.760
Chino!
Yes, Chef.

24:44.828 --> 24:46.696
<i>Get your head out of</i>
<i>the rice and talk to him!</i>

24:46.763 --> 24:48.164
Yes, Chef.
Yes, Chef.

24:48.231 --> 24:49.966
Chino reminds me
of a chipmunk on meth.

24:50.033 --> 24:51.901
He's a little bit
too hyperactive for me,

24:51.969 --> 24:54.937
and not all is calm
in his world.

24:55.005 --> 24:56.973
Burnt on the bottom.
Yup.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.875
Risotto burnt
and overcooked on the bottom.

24:59.943 --> 25:02.078
It's going to pot!

25:02.145 --> 25:04.213
I got it, Chef.
I got another one, Chef.

25:04.281 --> 25:06.449
It looked like somebody just
took the pan and in it

25:06.516 --> 25:08.784
and then tried to put
some risotto on that, man.

25:08.852 --> 25:11.020
Risotto, Chef.

25:11.088 --> 25:13.923
I can't believe it.
He did it again.

25:13.991 --> 25:17.293
I've got another
burnt risotto.

25:17.361 --> 25:20.596
It's burnt.
It's burnt!

25:20.664 --> 25:22.832
Chino, what the
is going on?

25:22.899 --> 25:24.367
<i>How long</i>
<i>for the risotto?</i>

25:24.434 --> 25:25.601
Eight minutes, Chef.

25:25.669 --> 25:27.069
Eight minutes.
Excuse me.

25:27.137 --> 25:29.038
I apologize.
Risotto's behind, yes?

25:29.106 --> 25:30.506
<i>Come on, Chino!</i>

25:30.574 --> 25:32.308
I can't have another
bad service today.

25:32.376 --> 25:33.876
Right now I have to
take this more serious

25:33.944 --> 25:35.211
than everybody else.
I have to prove to Chef Ramsay

25:35.278 --> 25:36.779
that I belong here.

25:36.847 --> 25:39.215
If you burn me that risotto
one more time--

25:39.282 --> 25:40.950
<i>look at me.</i>
<i>Hey, look at me.</i>

25:41.018 --> 25:42.852
I'll drag you out of here.
No, Chef, no, Chef.

25:42.919 --> 25:45.221
While Chino starts over
on the risotto,

25:45.288 --> 25:46.822
back in the red kitchen...

25:46.890 --> 25:47.857
How long on
the first scallop?

25:47.924 --> 25:49.492
Right now.

25:49.559 --> 25:51.394
The women
are pulling together

25:51.461 --> 25:52.728
and are pushing out appetizers
at a steady pace.

25:52.796 --> 25:54.997
Service, please,
table 30, thank you.

25:55.065 --> 25:56.699
Service, please.
Pick up 51.

25:56.767 --> 25:58.367
<i>Let's go, Carrie!</i>

25:58.435 --> 26:00.469
There's just one small issue.

26:00.537 --> 26:02.204
Oh, my gosh. I just found out
I'm at the wrong table.

26:02.272 --> 26:03.906
I'm so sorry!

26:03.974 --> 26:05.574
Two Caesar salad.
Carrie!

26:05.642 --> 26:08.177
Scallops are ready!
Yes.

26:08.245 --> 26:10.813
Customers don't wait
for Caesar salad. Come on!

26:10.881 --> 26:15.084
All right, so who's having
the Caesar salad?

26:15.152 --> 26:17.420
Let's go, Carrie!

26:17.487 --> 26:19.055
Chef Ramsay was on me
like white on rice.

26:19.122 --> 26:19.789
<i>Carrie!</i>
Yes, Chef.

26:19.856 --> 26:21.791
<i>Hurry up!</i>

26:21.858 --> 26:23.092
<i>Let's go, Carrie!</i>

26:23.160 --> 26:24.860
What did I do
to deserve this?

26:24.928 --> 26:28.097
Isn't this exciting?

26:28.165 --> 26:30.266
I need three Caesar salad.
Can someone go help her?

26:30.333 --> 26:31.667
Yes, I will.

26:31.735 --> 26:33.636
How can we be backed up
with the Caesar salad?

26:33.703 --> 26:36.372
What the .
Seriously, it's a Caesar salad.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.474
Hi, I'm gonna be
your assistant today.

26:38.542 --> 26:40.176
While Krupa
bails Carrie out,

26:40.243 --> 26:41.977
back in the blue kitchen...
Two risotto, Chef.

26:42.045 --> 26:43.646
Chino has finally
nailed a risotto.

26:43.713 --> 26:45.648
Very nice, that risotto.

26:45.715 --> 26:47.616
And appetizers
are leaving the kitchen.

26:47.684 --> 26:49.251
Keep it like that.
Yes, Chef.

26:49.319 --> 26:50.853
<i>You got</i>
<i>my sea bass working?</i>

26:50.921 --> 26:52.054
Brendan on the fish station

26:52.122 --> 26:53.856
is now ready
to move on to entrees...

26:53.924 --> 26:56.092
Sea bass is ready.
Are we ready to go on entrees?

26:56.159 --> 26:58.227
Brendan, I haven't--
I haven't called it.

26:58.295 --> 27:00.129
<i>Who called the entrees?</i>

27:00.197 --> 27:01.730
Even if Chef Ramsay isn't.

27:01.798 --> 27:03.065
Who's fire?
I need fire.

27:03.133 --> 27:04.300
Yes, Chef.

27:04.367 --> 27:05.501
Sea bass is at fire
and is ready.

27:05.569 --> 27:07.803
What is going on?

27:09.339 --> 27:11.140
You've cooked the bass.

27:11.208 --> 27:13.042
Is your meat ready?
No, Chef.

27:13.110 --> 27:14.810
And the garnish are ready?
No, Chef.

27:14.878 --> 27:18.013
You've got to work
as a team. Please!

27:18.081 --> 27:19.849
Brendan, man,
he jumped the gun.

27:19.916 --> 27:22.384
You know, he's too busy
trying not to up

27:22.452 --> 27:26.021
that he forgets
it's about communicating.

27:26.089 --> 27:27.556
Okay, let's go to
the first entree together.

27:27.624 --> 27:28.524
Yes, Chef.

27:28.592 --> 27:29.792
Timing!

27:29.860 --> 27:31.393
Yes, Chef.
Away now--

27:31.461 --> 27:32.962
<i>one sea bass,</i>
<i>one Wellington,</i>

27:33.029 --> 27:33.996
one New York strip,
one prime rib.

27:34.064 --> 27:34.897
Yes, Chef.

27:34.965 --> 27:37.333
Get another bass in!

27:37.400 --> 27:39.401
It's an hour
into dinner service,

27:39.469 --> 27:41.470
and while the men
have moved on to entrees...

27:41.538 --> 27:43.239
They would like
some fresh parmesan.

27:43.306 --> 27:45.174
I got that
parm for you.

27:45.242 --> 27:46.976
The women, thanks
to Krupa's speedy assist

27:47.043 --> 27:48.878
on the Caesar salads...

27:48.945 --> 27:50.312
<i>Enjoy your salad.</i>
Thank you.

27:50.380 --> 27:51.213
Have now caught up.

27:51.281 --> 27:52.047
All right, let's go.
Okay.

27:52.115 --> 27:54.216
Appetizers. Yay!

27:54.284 --> 27:55.851
This is very good.

27:55.919 --> 27:58.087
<i>Here we go!</i>
<i>Are we ready?</i>

27:58.155 --> 27:59.522
Walking sea bass.
Nice job!
Nice job!

28:01.091 --> 28:02.191
Brendan.

28:02.259 --> 28:03.759
Yes, Chef.
Is that the same bass?

28:03.827 --> 28:05.127
<i>No, Chef.</i>

28:05.195 --> 28:06.028
You didn't start
a fresh one?

28:06.096 --> 28:07.263
Yes, I did, Chef.

28:07.330 --> 28:08.531
So where's
the old one, then?

28:08.598 --> 28:09.999
Threw it away, Chef.

28:10.066 --> 28:11.333
Show me.
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:14.004 --> 28:16.138
Chef,
I can't find it.
<i>Are you lying to me?</i>

28:16.206 --> 28:18.774
'Cause I'm gonna stop
this whole kitchen.

28:18.842 --> 28:20.576
<i>I'm gonna ask you</i>
<i>one more time</i>

28:20.644 --> 28:22.811
to tell me the truth--
is that the bass

28:22.879 --> 28:24.346
<i>from ten minutes ago,</i>

28:24.414 --> 28:26.081
<i>or is that a fresh one</i>
<i>you've cooked?</i>

28:26.149 --> 28:26.916
'Cause I'm gonna turn
this kitchen

28:26.983 --> 28:28.551
<i>upside down.</i>

28:31.354 --> 28:32.788
Oh, my God.

28:39.817 --> 28:41.374
It's an hour
into dinner service,

28:41.375 --> 28:43.803
and the blue team has just
delivered their first entrees.

28:44.558 --> 28:46.092
Brendan.
Yes, Chef.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.561
Is that the same bass?
No, Chef.

28:48.629 --> 28:51.130
But Chef Ramsay
is a little suspicious.

28:51.198 --> 28:52.265
You didn't start
a fresh one?

28:52.332 --> 28:53.433
Yes, I did, Chef.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.700
So where's
the old one, then?

28:54.768 --> 28:56.169
Threw it away, Chef.

28:56.236 --> 28:57.503
Show me.
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:00.174 --> 29:02.308
Chef,
I can't find it.
<i>Are you lying to me?</i>

29:02.376 --> 29:04.944
'Cause I'm gonna stop
this whole kitchen.

29:05.012 --> 29:06.746
<i>I'm gonna ask you</i>
<i>one more time</i>

29:06.814 --> 29:08.981
to tell me the truth--
is that the bass

29:09.049 --> 29:10.516
<i>from ten minutes ago,</i>

29:10.584 --> 29:12.251
<i>or is that a fresh one</i>
<i>you've cooked?</i>

29:12.319 --> 29:13.086
'Cause I'm gonna turn
this kitchen

29:13.153 --> 29:14.020
<i>upside down.</i>

29:14.088 --> 29:15.388
Is that old?

29:15.456 --> 29:16.589
Chef, yes.

29:20.094 --> 29:21.260
Why?

29:21.328 --> 29:23.463
Start a new bass,
start a new bass.

29:23.530 --> 29:25.531
<i>Stop. Everybody, stop.</i>
<i>New garnish.</i>

29:25.599 --> 29:27.733
Brendan's an idiot
for lying to Chef Ramsay,

29:27.801 --> 29:29.469
'cause, like, seriously, you're
making a fool of yourself.

29:29.536 --> 29:30.970
And how dare you go
to the garbage can,

29:31.038 --> 29:33.306
search it,
and turn me out like that.

29:33.373 --> 29:35.541
Yes, Chef. Firing again,
firing again.

29:35.609 --> 29:37.343
You do that to me
one more time,

29:37.411 --> 29:39.011
<i>trust me,</i>
<i>the elimination.</i>

29:39.079 --> 29:40.813
I'll send you out
there and then,

29:40.881 --> 29:42.148
<i>let me</i>
<i>tell you that.</i>

29:42.216 --> 29:43.449
Yes, Chef.
Won't happen again.

29:43.517 --> 29:46.252
Chef Ramsay
is not a stupid person.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.787
I was blowing smoke
up his ,

29:47.855 --> 29:48.821
and he called me out
on it.

29:48.889 --> 29:50.123
Start again!

29:50.190 --> 29:52.692
Firing a new bass now, Chef.

29:52.759 --> 29:54.093
While the blue team starts over

29:54.161 --> 29:55.862
on their first entree,

29:55.929 --> 29:57.830
over in the red kitchen,
Elise...

29:57.898 --> 29:59.932
Sea bass!
Where's the chicken?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.467
Has decided to take on
the role of leader.

30:01.535 --> 30:03.035
Cut the Wellington.

30:03.103 --> 30:05.438
Let's get our prep up
to the window, ladies.

30:05.506 --> 30:07.206
Elise has
an awfully big mouth.

30:07.274 --> 30:09.408
<i>One minute to the window</i>
<i>with black cod,</i>

30:09.476 --> 30:12.445
lamb, confit potatoes,
and Brussels sprouts.

30:12.513 --> 30:15.014
Elise is on
her little high horse right now.

30:15.082 --> 30:17.216
She's not leading.
She's yelling and screaming.

30:17.284 --> 30:18.284
Start carving.

30:18.352 --> 30:19.752
How long, please?

30:19.820 --> 30:21.687
Ten minutes
to the window.

30:21.755 --> 30:23.389
<i>Ten minutes?</i>
Ten seconds.

30:23.457 --> 30:25.091
<i>No, ten seconds I meant.</i>

30:25.159 --> 30:26.092
Don't point at me.
I'm not a dog.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.226
Okay?
Yes.

30:27.294 --> 30:28.961
Let's get real
a little bit.

30:29.029 --> 30:30.796
Ten minutes? Listen--
no, I meant ten seconds.

30:30.864 --> 30:32.932
Listen.
Come here, you.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.201
If you think I'm gonna
tolerate your big, fat mouth

30:35.269 --> 30:36.702
<i>by talking over me</i>
<i>every time</i>

30:36.770 --> 30:38.104
I'm trying to tell you
something,

30:38.172 --> 30:39.071
I'll kick you out
here and now.

30:39.139 --> 30:40.106
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

30:40.174 --> 30:41.407
Let me finish
my sentence,

30:41.475 --> 30:43.309
and don't be so rude.
Is that clear?

30:43.377 --> 30:45.444
Yes, Chef.
Give me a 30-second window,
and stop pointing at me

30:45.512 --> 30:47.046
like I'm some picture,
got it?
I--

30:47.114 --> 30:49.081
good!

30:51.885 --> 30:55.454
Finally someone can get Elise
to shut up, okay?

30:55.522 --> 30:57.323
Thank you, Chef Ramsay.

30:57.391 --> 30:59.125
While Elise,
for a moment,

30:59.193 --> 31:00.660
has been silenced
in the red kitchen...

31:00.727 --> 31:02.695
One duck, one lamb.
Let's go!

31:02.763 --> 31:04.130
The blue team
is still struggling

31:04.198 --> 31:05.531
to get out
their first entree.

31:05.599 --> 31:07.133
Let's go! It's time
to stop around!

31:07.201 --> 31:08.401
<i>Let's do this!</i>

31:08.468 --> 31:10.002
I'm waiting for the duck.

31:10.070 --> 31:11.137
<i>Let's move!</i>
<i>Tommy, how long?</i>

31:11.205 --> 31:12.338
Three minutes, buddy.

31:12.406 --> 31:14.373
Hustle! I'm tired of
getting my ass kicked!

31:14.441 --> 31:16.576
Chill out, please.
<i>Stop arguing,</i>

31:16.643 --> 31:19.178

Starting to piss me off, man.

31:19.246 --> 31:21.581
Don't question what I'm doing
until the chef yells at me.

31:21.648 --> 31:22.782
I knew what I had to do,
and I kept cranking it out.

31:22.849 --> 31:24.317
Duck coming up.
My apologies.

31:24.384 --> 31:25.785
Just relax.
Let me do my thing.

31:25.852 --> 31:27.086
Oh, come on!

31:29.590 --> 31:30.856
Uh, Tommy...

31:38.832 --> 31:40.032
<i>It's overcooked.</i>

31:40.100 --> 31:42.068

31:54.815 --> 31:56.582

to send out a single entree.

Let's finish this strong.

32:05.759 --> 32:08.261

to lead them vocally.

32:08.328 --> 32:10.930
Let's go! We're getting
ready to plate, ladies.

32:10.998 --> 32:12.565
So I'm gonna drive

32:12.633 --> 32:14.133

squash puree.

32:14.201 --> 32:15.501

32:16.870 --> 32:18.104

32:19.973 --> 32:22.775

Yes? The prime rib.

32:22.843 --> 32:24.410

32:27.414 --> 32:28.748

32:28.815 --> 32:31.450

32:31.518 --> 32:32.752
<i>or is that</i>

32:36.390 --> 32:38.724

Krupa, Krupa.

32:38.792 --> 32:42.328

prime rib on the floor.

32:42.396 --> 32:44.363
Ohh, I feel like an ass.

32:44.431 --> 32:45.798
Chef Ramsay,
I just fell

32:45.866 --> 32:47.366
with the whole ribs
in my hand, so--

32:47.434 --> 32:49.302
oh, for sake.
The whole thing?

32:49.369 --> 32:51.003
The whole thing.
I'm sorry.

32:51.071 --> 32:53.105
Oh, you're kidding me.
Oh, come on.

32:53.173 --> 32:54.940
<i>One simple task.</i>

32:55.008 --> 32:56.742
Monterray, Monterray...
Yes, Chef.

32:56.810 --> 32:59.045
Once you finish the rib,
serve the rib to Krupa.

32:59.112 --> 33:01.280
Hey, butterfingers,
when he's finished serving

33:01.348 --> 33:03.316
the rib from the blue team,
take the trolley.

33:03.383 --> 33:05.751
Do not drop it!
Yes, Chef.

33:05.819 --> 33:07.219
While Krupa takes the fall

33:07.287 --> 33:09.588

33:09.656 --> 33:11.557
Sea bass is ready!

33:11.625 --> 33:13.859
The men are ready
with their third attempt

33:13.927 --> 33:15.127

33:15.195 --> 33:16.562
Oh, come on.

33:16.630 --> 33:20.499
Brendan, it's raw.

coming in

34:08.882 --> 34:10.815

"Literally taking

<i>lying to you about the fish.</i>

39:05.702 --> 39:08.638
<i>I was mistaken in giving you</i>
<i>the wrong answer,</i>

39:08.705 --> 39:11.374
and that is not
a reflection of me.

39:11.441 --> 39:12.475
Chino.

39:12.543 --> 39:14.277
Yes, Chef.

39:14.344 --> 39:16.112
Are you done?
<i>I'm not done.</i>

39:16.180 --> 39:17.947
I'm gonna be as honest
as possible to you.

39:18.015 --> 39:19.916
Maybe I'm not as good
as I thought I was.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.051
<i>I thought I was pretty good</i>
<i>before I came here,</i>

39:22.119 --> 39:23.452
<i>so it's been</i>
<i>really humbling.</i>

39:23.520 --> 39:24.921
See, people like me,

39:24.988 --> 39:26.322
I will always get better
at something.

39:26.390 --> 39:27.723
<i>No matter how old I am,</i>

39:27.791 --> 39:29.292
I will get better
at something,

39:29.359 --> 39:30.459
because I'll be
honest with myself,

39:30.527 --> 39:31.861
<i>and I can face the facts.</i>

39:31.929 --> 39:32.728
Are you better
than Brendan?

39:32.796 --> 39:33.996
<i>Absolutely.</i>

39:34.064 --> 39:35.698
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't think that.

39:35.766 --> 39:37.567
<i>Okay.</i>

39:37.634 --> 39:41.070
The person leaving
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i> is...

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

39:50.276 --> 39:52.110
After an embarrassing service

39:52.178 --> 39:53.878
in which they got kicked out
of the kitchen

39:53.946 --> 39:55.280
and their diners
fed by the women,

39:55.855 --> 39:57.622
the blue team has nominated

39:57.690 --> 39:59.491
Chino and Brendan
for elimination.

39:59.558 --> 40:03.461
The person leaving
<i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

40:03.529 --> 40:05.630
Is...

40:09.484 --> 40:11.518
Brendan.
Give me your chef jacket.

40:11.586 --> 40:12.586
Yes, Chef.

40:12.653 --> 40:13.954
Your time's done, buddy.

40:16.724 --> 40:17.858
Thank you, Chef.

40:17.925 --> 40:20.227
Thank you.
Good night.

40:24.799 --> 40:25.899
I'm out.

40:25.967 --> 40:27.667
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

40:27.735 --> 40:29.202
I'm sad to leave
<i>Hell's Kitchen,</i>

40:29.270 --> 40:30.837
but, uh, I'm gonna
go back to New York

40:30.905 --> 40:32.759
and lead another kitchen
to greatness.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.494
Uh, I just want to give
a shout-out to Carrie.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.797
Good luck.
I am your biggest fan.

40:36.864 --> 40:38.999
And, uh, call me.
All right?

40:39.067 --> 40:41.034
Chino.
Yes, Chef.

40:41.102 --> 40:42.436
<i>Get better. Quickly.</i>

40:42.503 --> 40:44.838
Uh, ladies,
I got a small problem.

40:44.906 --> 40:46.740
I need to
talk to you all.

40:46.808 --> 40:50.544
<i>We've only seen men</i>
<i>leave the building.</i>

40:50.611 --> 40:54.281
<i>Tomorrow morning I need</i>
<i>to hear from a volunteer</i>

40:54.349 --> 40:57.918
who will go
to the men's team...

40:57.985 --> 41:01.822
<i>And give them</i>
<i>much needed support.</i>

41:04.592 --> 41:06.660
Chef, um...
With all due respect,

41:06.728 --> 41:09.062
I would like to just roll
with the six I have.

41:09.130 --> 41:10.731
<i>Be real, bro.</i>
<i>Hell, yeah, man.</i>

41:10.798 --> 41:12.966
<i>Agreed.</i>
<i>We all agree on that, Chef.</i>

41:14.402 --> 41:15.836
We all agree, Chef.

41:15.903 --> 41:17.371
<i>We'd like to roll</i>
<i>the way we're at.</i>

41:17.438 --> 41:18.271
I'm rolling the dice.
Damn that.

41:18.339 --> 41:19.639
<i>Yup.</i>

41:19.707 --> 41:21.274
Thank you for your thought.

41:21.342 --> 41:22.609
<i>Let me tell you.</i>

41:22.677 --> 41:24.678
You're striving
for a reputation.

41:24.746 --> 41:26.980
I've got one.

41:27.048 --> 41:29.483
And you are not
gonna ruin it.

41:29.550 --> 41:31.618
Get out of here.

41:31.686 --> 41:33.920
With all due respect
to the women, let us cook.

41:33.988 --> 41:36.690
Let us show you
what the six of us now have.

41:36.758 --> 41:39.626
I do not like that idea
whatso--ever.

41:39.694 --> 41:42.696
They can't even put their
away for five seconds

41:42.764 --> 41:44.231
and realize
that they need some help?

41:44.298 --> 41:45.632
It's pretty ridiculous,

41:45.700 --> 41:47.434
and it's embarrassing.

41:47.502 --> 41:48.435
I am zen.

41:48.503 --> 41:50.137
You cannot penetrate me.

41:50.204 --> 41:52.072
I'm the guy that has
nothing to lose,

41:52.140 --> 41:54.274
and I really don't give
a what anybody thinks.

41:54.342 --> 41:56.243
Bunch of frauds.

41:56.310 --> 41:58.278
The only thing bigger
than Brendan's ego

41:58.346 --> 41:59.980
are the lies that he tells,

42:00.047 --> 42:01.748
and I can't have that
in Hell's Kitchen.

42:01.773 --> 42:05.773

42:06.155 --> 42:08.189
Next time on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:08.257 --> 42:10.658
The chefs come face-to-face
with their worst fears.

42:12.962 --> 42:14.295
With children
in the dining room...

42:14.363 --> 42:16.831
Aw!
Let's do this!

42:16.899 --> 42:18.499
It's the chefs
who are acting like infants.

42:18.567 --> 42:19.634
I need a ham on the fly!

42:19.702 --> 42:20.835
I'm making it now.

42:20.903 --> 42:22.036
You want to serve it,
bro?

42:22.104 --> 42:23.438
You bring it to 'em.

42:23.505 --> 42:24.706
The babies are out there.
Not in here.

42:24.773 --> 42:25.873
In the blue kitchen...

42:25.941 --> 42:27.041
Raw!
This is embarrassing!

42:27.109 --> 42:28.090
One chef...

42:28.091 --> 42:30.126
Look at him
the entire freaking time.

42:30.193 --> 42:31.761
Change your pot.
Walk the garnish up there now.

42:31.828 --> 42:32.762
Can't play well with others.

42:32.829 --> 42:34.463
Tommy,
put the food back.

42:34.531 --> 42:36.032
But the childlike behavior
doesn't stop there.

42:36.099 --> 42:37.633
Why are you in my space?

42:37.701 --> 42:39.435
I'm so mad,
I could punch a wall out.

42:39.503 --> 42:41.570
As the red team
declares war on Carrie.

42:41.638 --> 42:43.105
I didn't say
a word.

42:43.173 --> 42:44.607
Do you take medication?
You're crazy.

42:44.675 --> 42:46.742
Pushing Carrie
to her breaking point.

42:46.810 --> 42:48.244
You .
I did.

42:48.312 --> 42:50.279
I am so
pissed off right now.

42:50.347 --> 42:52.014
It's one of the most

42:52.082 --> 42:53.382
confrontational
<i>Hell's Kitchens</i> ever,

42:53.450 --> 42:55.986
and it's all
coming your way next time.
