08:18.131 --> 08:21.166
John, you're 50
and you're not famous.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.868
And you won't let other
people sing your songs.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.336
In rock and roll, you know
what that makes you?

08:24.338 --> 08:25.270
What?

08:25.272 --> 08:26.671
A bartender.

08:27.608 --> 08:28.974
The dream is over.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.442
Time to move on.

08:30.444 --> 08:32.310
Ira, listen.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.612
You know i can't
work a regular job.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.813
I don't have
the skills for that.

08:34.815 --> 08:35.814
You got to
get me a gig.

08:35.816 --> 08:36.882
I'll take anything.
Come on.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.117
There's got
to be something.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.052
Bears with bikes needs
a rhythm guitar player.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.320
I can't play with
a bunch of

08:42.322 --> 08:43.822
Pretentious
indie-rock assholes.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.023
They're four bears
who ride bikes.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.291
You play them on
and offstage.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.059
You want me
to join the circus.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.528
Oh.
Summer of '69.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.529
What's that?
A sex show?

08:50.531 --> 08:51.463
Bryan adams tribute band.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.797
Their bryan adams left

08:52.799 --> 08:54.299
To be the new sting
in stung.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.500
What, i can't be
the new sting in stung?

08:55.502 --> 08:56.568
Not when you look like

08:56.570 --> 08:58.103
Bryan adams's grandfather.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.039
Jon non-jovi.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.807
Jon non-jovi...

09:02.809 --> 09:04.009
What?

09:04.011 --> 09:05.143
Their fake sambora

09:05.145 --> 09:06.344
Fired their fake bon jovi

09:06.346 --> 09:07.846
Because he's going bald.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.181
For real; now, you still
got a nice head of hair.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.217
What do these assholes
make for playing

09:12.219 --> 09:13.318
Other people's songs?

09:13.320 --> 09:14.686
15 to 20 grand.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.854
A year.

09:15.856 --> 09:16.855
A week.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.323
A week?

09:18.325 --> 09:19.524
Summer of '69 is less
than half that.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.159
Still very, very nice.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.160
[phone rings]

09:22.162 --> 09:23.028
[sighs]

09:23.030 --> 09:24.162
All right.
Bryan adams.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.497
Non bon jovi.

09:25.499 --> 09:27.032
That's all i got
for you, my friend.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.166
Okay? This is about steve.
I got to take this.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.935
[sighs]

09:31.672 --> 09:33.572
Listen.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.507
I've never asked you
for anything.

09:35.509 --> 09:38.543
Okay, i did ask you to keep me
from having a heart attack

09:38.545 --> 09:41.746
That one time we did
the pink blow from peru--

09:41.748 --> 09:44.683
The two times i did
the pink blow from peru--

09:44.685 --> 09:47.619
But you got to
help me out here.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.887
I'll--i'll quit drugs.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.221
For real this time.
I swear to god.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.356
You just--you--

09:51.358 --> 09:52.524
You got to give me
something, man.

09:52.526 --> 09:53.758
Some kind of a sign
or something.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.894
I--i can't just be,
like, a bartender

09:55.896 --> 09:57.228
Or just like
a regular person.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.597
I mean, why did you
give me all this talent

09:58.599 --> 10:01.466
If i was just gonna fail?

10:01.468 --> 10:04.436
What am i doing?

10:04.438 --> 10:07.205
Praying to a guy i don't
even really believe in.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.107
Or a chick.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.308
- Hey.
- Okay.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.744
Ah!
What gig did feinbaum get you?

10:12.746 --> 10:13.912
Bryan adams
tribute band.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.380
- Oh!
- All right. Listen.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.781
No, honey.
It sounds worse than it is.

10:16.783 --> 10:17.716
- Okay? It could be way worse.
- Really?

10:17.718 --> 10:19.117
- Yes.
- How?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.385
- Jon non-jovi. Okay?
- Oh, my god.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.553
- What?
- Oh, my god.

10:21.555 --> 10:23.321
This is it.
This is what happens.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.390
Hacking knock-off bands
after three goddamn decades.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.591
Honey.
Honey, listen to me.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.892
The bryan adams
tribute thing

10:27.894 --> 10:29.461
Pays, like,
eight grand a week,

10:29.463 --> 10:30.929
And the non-jovi thing
could be twice as much as that.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.731
Oh, my god, you're
actually considering this.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.065
- Look--who's gonna know?
- I'm gonna know.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.066
- Nobody's gonna know.
- Okay?

10:35.068 --> 10:36.101
I'm gonna know.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.469
Go to hell, johnny.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.503
Oh, wait.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.071
You're in a fake
bon jovi band.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.606
Well, guess what?
You're already there.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.842
- Honey, i just--
- hang on, you guys.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.910
- We got company.
- What do they want?

10:45.912 --> 10:47.012
Probably money.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.413
Yo, bitch.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.848
If it's money
you're looking for,

10:49.850 --> 10:51.583
You're barking up
the wrong friggin' tree.

10:51.585 --> 10:52.951
So screw.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.819
I don't need any money
from you assholes.

10:54.821 --> 10:55.987
I'm rich.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.358
I love your shoes!

11:02.429 --> 11:04.696
- Hey!
- What's going on?

11:04.698 --> 11:06.464
I'm so sorry about kicking
you in the nuts last night, dad.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.632
Nah.
Not a problem.

11:07.634 --> 11:08.767
This is my friend becky.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.801
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.202
It's our first time
in new york.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.270
Hey, how's it going?

11:12.272 --> 11:13.805
Well, we went
to the 9/11 museum

11:13.807 --> 11:14.706
At ground zero.

11:14.708 --> 11:15.974
It was so awesome.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.342
Yeah, and then we saw
some famous people

11:17.344 --> 11:18.710
At this club downtown
last night.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.612
Oh, yeah, miley cyrus's
half-sister, brandi,

11:20.614 --> 11:22.313
And lindsay lohan's
mom--deans.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.815
Those people
are not famous.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.650
I know, right?
They're beyond famous.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.285
- They're huge.
- No, the beatles were huge.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.553
- Yeah.
- Sinatra. Paul newman.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.954
- They were huge.
- What do you mean were?

11:29.956 --> 11:31.356
What happened to paul newman?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.324
Paul newman died,
like, five years ago.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.226
- The popcorn guy?
- No, no. He was a chef.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.962
Speaking of fame,
that's why i'm here.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.998
I need you to help me
get famous.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.533
- Aww.
- Aww.

11:41.535 --> 11:42.567
Famous how?

11:42.569 --> 11:43.968
She's an
unbelievable singer.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.470
No, no, no.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.805
I'm not getting involved
in some hick from ohio's

11:46.807 --> 11:48.373
Ridiculous pipe dream--
no way.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.909
You know, my mom would never
let me be in a band

11:50.911 --> 11:52.811
Or anything because she
hates show business,

11:52.813 --> 11:54.646
But she told me
that once i moved out,

11:54.648 --> 11:55.914
I could do whatever i wanted.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.249
So this hick from ohio
moved out.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.651
Congratulations.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.619
And then she gave me
$200,000.

12:04.725 --> 12:05.690
Great name for a band:
Pipe dream.

12:05.692 --> 12:06.991
Yes.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.660
I can sing,
but i can't write,

12:08.662 --> 12:10.495
So i need you and flash
to write me some songs.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.596
I don't need flash
to write 'em.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.064
I can write 'em
on my own.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.332
Oh, i'm sorry.
Your solo album sucked.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.600
His solo album sucked.

12:15.602 --> 12:16.835
But the songs you guys
wrote together

12:16.837 --> 12:18.269
For the heathens
were awesome.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.871
- Plus, he's kind of famous.
- Really famous.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.673
He's not kind of famous.
He's not even close.

12:21.675 --> 12:22.674
I'm sorry, are you
gaga's new guitar player?

12:22.676 --> 12:23.775
- Oh, my god.
- Oh!

12:23.777 --> 12:25.410
- Does he know gaga?
- Yeah. He does.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.411
Does he breathe the same exalted
air that she does

12:26.413 --> 12:27.345
On a daily basis?

12:27.347 --> 12:28.847
Yep.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.348
Let me explain
something to you, okay?

12:30.350 --> 12:31.282
He should apologize to me
because he broke up

12:31.284 --> 12:33.251
With me, not vice versa.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.619
Oh, god, you don't have to be
such a little bitch about it.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.187
Tell flash not to be
such a bitch about it.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.956
Oh, my god, i will pay you
two grand in cash

12:37.958 --> 12:39.224
If you go sit down with flash.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.226
I'll tell him myself
in person.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.862
I booked a rehearsal space,
and i want to sing<i> animal</i>

12:43.864 --> 12:46.731
Off the only heathens album
ever recorded.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.733
What do you say?

12:48.735 --> 12:49.901
Done deal. Yeah.

12:49.903 --> 12:50.869
- Right? Cool.
- Yeah.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.303
All right. Good.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.772
Hey, maybe mom was wrong
about you.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.274
Why?
What did she say?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.777
She said you were a lazy,
selfish pothead alcoholic

12:58.779 --> 13:00.145
With a small dick
and a death wish.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.613
[scoffs]

13:05.719 --> 13:06.985
[sighs]

13:06.987 --> 13:08.620
Can i talk to you
alone for a sec?

13:08.622 --> 13:10.088
Okay.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.723
What, is this gonna
be your "i'm sorry

13:11.725 --> 13:12.657
"i was never
there for you

13:12.659 --> 13:13.958
"because i never
knew you existed

13:13.960 --> 13:15.226
Blah blah blah"
speech?

13:15.228 --> 13:16.728
This is, you know,
gonna be my

13:16.730 --> 13:17.829
"i'm sorry i wasn't
there for you

13:17.831 --> 13:19.597
"'cause i never
knew you existed

13:19.599 --> 13:20.999
"because i didn't stay
in touch with your mother

13:21.001 --> 13:22.901
And i feel bad
about that."

13:22.903 --> 13:24.135
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.171
Really?

13:26.173 --> 13:27.605
I forgive you.

13:27.607 --> 13:28.606
You do.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.741
No.

13:29.743 --> 13:31.476
You should not only
feel guilty

13:31.478 --> 13:32.977
About never knowing me,

13:32.979 --> 13:35.280
But you should feel
really, really shitty

13:35.282 --> 13:37.115
About me growing up
without a father figure

13:37.117 --> 13:38.583
In friggin' a-hole ohio.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.585
So leave your feelings
out of this.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.586
I don't want
to hear them.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.754
I don't need a dad.

13:42.756 --> 13:45.190
I need a goddamn
songwriter.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.791
Flash and the
entire gaga crew

13:46.793 --> 13:48.259
Are staying
at the gansevoort,

13:48.261 --> 13:49.594
And in case he doesn't
respond to money,

13:49.596 --> 13:51.462
Because, unlike you,
he actually has some,

13:51.464 --> 13:53.331
You can show him this.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.600
What?

13:55.602 --> 13:56.801
You want me
to be your pimp?

13:56.803 --> 13:58.036
See?
We're bonding already.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.637
Tell him i have
a thing for him.

13:59.639 --> 14:00.839
Do you have a thing
for him?

14:01.842 --> 14:02.874
I have your number.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.142
I'll text it to you.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.276
You--

14:05.278 --> 14:06.277
Thank you, daddy.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.478
Come on, becky.
Let's go.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.880
Bye, girls!
I'll text you!

14:08.882 --> 14:09.981
Bye!

14:09.983 --> 14:11.482
See you later,
mr. Rock!

14:11.484 --> 14:12.851
Yeah.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.788
That's my girl.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.790
What if she can't
really sing?

14:18.792 --> 14:21.159
Well, then we do what's best
for everybody involved.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.827
Send her back
to her mom?

14:22.829 --> 14:24.195
No.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.864
String her along
until the money runs out.

14:32.739 --> 14:33.738
[camera shutters clicking]

14:33.740 --> 14:34.973
Hey.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.074
How you guys doing?

14:36.076 --> 14:37.308
- Move. Move.
- Move it!

14:37.310 --> 14:38.810
- Move out of the way!
- Move!

14:38.812 --> 14:40.078
- What?
- Brody. Brody.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.480
Brody. Brody, here.
Here. Brody!

14:42.482 --> 14:43.581
Who's that guy?

14:43.583 --> 14:44.716
Bruce jenner's
son brody.

14:44.718 --> 14:45.650
What?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.352
World-renowned
club dj.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.821
That's the guy you guys
are taking photos of?

14:49.823 --> 14:51.322
That douchebag?

14:51.324 --> 14:52.891
The only reason
his whole family's famous

14:52.893 --> 14:54.659
Is because his fat-ass
half sister

14:54.661 --> 14:56.594
Is good at sucking
celebrity dick.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.696
I mean, seriously.
That's her talent.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.365
Google "kim kardashian
blowjobs,"

15:00.367 --> 15:01.599
'cause you know how many
entries come up?

15:01.601 --> 15:03.768
481,000.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.436
That's what i read in the paper.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.171
I mean, is that what it takes
to be famous nowadays?

15:07.173 --> 15:09.207
Huh?
Sucking semi-famous penis?

15:09.209 --> 15:10.708
'cause if it is,
sign me up.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.110
I'll suck bruce jenner's cock

15:12.112 --> 15:13.945
Right here in front
of the gansevoort hotel.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.346
That's if he
still has one.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.081
I'm serious.
I want to blow bruce jenner.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.283
What? What?

15:18.285 --> 15:19.784
What? Let me go.
Hey.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.185
Freedom of speech.
I can say whatever i want.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.453
Hey, man.
I got him.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.188
You want to blow
bruce jenner, huh?

15:24.190 --> 15:25.890
I can explain
what happened.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.559
I--i can't explain
what happened.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.194
I am not lending you
any money.

15:30.196 --> 15:31.529
Who said anything
about money?

15:31.531 --> 15:33.231
I talked to dulli
this morning.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.699
We're not getting the band
back together either.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.034
Listen. Okay, listen.
That's not.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.435
I just want to have
a conversation.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.636
(woman)
oh, hey! Hey! Hey!
Hello. Hey!

15:38.638 --> 15:40.538
Oh, you're the
guitar player!

15:40.540 --> 15:42.240
Oh, we loved the show
last night.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.741
- Can you sign my tit?
- Sure.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.276
She wants to be a singer
just like gaga,

15:45.278 --> 15:47.211
And she's really, really,
really talented

15:47.213 --> 15:48.746
And she's 19,
so she's legal,

15:48.748 --> 15:49.881
If you're interested.

15:49.883 --> 15:51.049
- Right, honey?
- Oh, yeah.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.984
Are you anybody?

15:52.986 --> 15:55.586
You never heard
of johnny rock, girls?

15:55.588 --> 15:56.721
Uh...

15:56.723 --> 15:57.755
No.

15:57.757 --> 15:58.890
Hey!
There goes gaga.

15:58.892 --> 15:59.757
Oh!
Go, go, go, go.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.660
[screaming and cheering]

16:02.662 --> 16:03.795
Are you shitting me?

16:03.797 --> 16:04.729
What do you want, john?

16:04.731 --> 16:06.230
Small favor.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.465
Doesn't involve
any money from you.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.933
I'm never playing
with you again.

16:08.935 --> 16:12.236
As in never ever,
asshole.

16:12.238 --> 16:13.604
Listen.
You owe me.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.106
I was the one that said,
"hey, let's start a band

16:15.108 --> 16:16.908
Together," and then i
was the guy that said,

16:16.910 --> 16:18.276
Once we had the band,
"hey, let's start writing

16:18.278 --> 16:19.777
Some songs together,"
so when you think

16:19.779 --> 16:21.579
About it, you wouldn't
be sitting here

16:21.581 --> 16:23.414
In this plush limo today
without me.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.782
You sound like
my ex-wife.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.584
I was with you for twice
as long as she was.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.087
And i gave you that really nice
skull-and-crossbone ring.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.355
- Not her.
- Who gives a shit?

16:30.357 --> 16:31.923
- I give a shit.
- We're grown men now.

16:31.925 --> 16:34.425
And i'm playing in gaga's
band in spite of you

16:34.427 --> 16:36.327
'cause you held me back
all those years.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.762
- I held you back.
- Your ego.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.264
And your rock-and-roll
destructive bullshit ways.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.265
Okay. Whatever.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.433
You still doing blow?

16:42.435 --> 16:43.768
No, i'm not doing blow.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.303
I haven't done blow in ages.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.105
'cause you quit,
or you can't afford it?

16:47.107 --> 16:48.306
[laughs]

16:48.308 --> 16:51.275
Flash...

16:51.277 --> 16:52.777
This isn't about drugs.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.212
I'm talking about
a different high.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.547
A connection between
me and you, man.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.282
When we were working
together, man,

16:58.284 --> 17:00.952
Live on stage, our vibe
was killer, dude.

17:00.954 --> 17:02.787
Just the two of us.
Wide awake.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.222
We were taking
our emotions--

17:04.224 --> 17:06.324
Not gaga's,
not jon bon jovi's

17:06.326 --> 17:08.059
Or anybody--
our emotions, man,

17:08.061 --> 17:10.061
And our angst
and whatever we were feeling

17:10.063 --> 17:11.562
And we were throwing it
into the amps,

17:11.564 --> 17:13.965
And it was coming
back out genius stuff.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.299
Remember when the
record came out

17:15.301 --> 17:16.534
And the guy
from<i> rolling stone</i>

17:16.536 --> 17:18.236
Wrote that early review

17:18.238 --> 17:19.971
And he called you
the wizard spawn

17:19.973 --> 17:21.672
Of pete townshend
and the edge?

17:21.674 --> 17:23.074
We were so happy.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.809
That's what i'm
talking about.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.645
When we were making
people dance and scream

17:27.647 --> 17:30.014
And changing
their lives, man.

17:30.016 --> 17:31.916
That's the drug
i'm after, dude.

17:31.918 --> 17:35.987
That's--that's
the high i want.

17:35.989 --> 17:36.988
[sighs]

17:36.990 --> 17:39.357
Me too, johnny.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.325
I mean, i'll do some
drugs, if you have some.

17:41.327 --> 17:42.760
Not blow, but, like,
prescription stuff.

17:42.762 --> 17:43.861
Get out.
Get out!

17:43.863 --> 17:44.929
Okay. Okay.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.364
Let me explain
the favor thing.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.199
Cat, when she went
to ohio--turns out,

17:48.201 --> 17:49.834
Long story short,
she was pregnant by me.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.269
She never told me
and now i have a daughter

17:51.271 --> 17:52.537
And she's here
and she's 25 years old

17:52.539 --> 17:54.038
And she thinks she can sing.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.407
She rented the big room
at sir tomorrow at 10:00

17:56.409 --> 17:58.676
And she's paying me and
bam bam and rehab to be there

17:58.678 --> 17:59.844
And we really need
the money, man,

17:59.846 --> 18:01.045
And it doesn't cost you a dime.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.046
All you got to do
is show up.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.014
Let me think about it.
No.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.382
Come on.
They need the bread.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.150
I need the bread.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.355
[sighs]

18:11.357 --> 18:13.891
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.193
What?

18:15.195 --> 18:18.162
[inhales sharply]

18:22.902 --> 18:24.368
Never mind.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.236
- What do you got there?
- No.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.237
No, no, no, no.
Give me.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.039
Holy shit.
Is that her?

18:28.041 --> 18:29.774
No, that's not her.
That's--that's a guy.

18:29.776 --> 18:30.942
That's the lead singer.
Remember chicks with dicks?

18:30.944 --> 18:32.610
- She a gaga fan?
- No.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.611
She hates gaga.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.912
I'm in. I'm way in.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.147
She's too young
for you, man.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.615
Give it to me.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.817
You just saw me sign
the tit of a 19-year-old.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.419
See you tomorrow at 10:00.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.287
Payback's a bitch.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.229
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.663
We don't have a lot of time,
and i got a couple things

18:52.665 --> 18:54.732
I want to say, so i don't
want to be interrupting.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.567
What?

18:56.569 --> 18:58.269
Listen, this probably
isn't gonna take very long,

18:58.271 --> 18:59.604
'cause like you, i'm assuming

18:59.606 --> 19:01.572
That gigi's not exactly
the real deal,

19:01.574 --> 19:02.974
But let's look
at the bright side.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.442
We can get a nice
little jam session in

19:04.444 --> 19:05.943
On her dime
after she's done,

19:05.945 --> 19:07.745
But i want to lay down a couple
hard-and-fast rules.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.647
Number one: Nobody sleeps
with my daughter.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.482
Number two: Nobody sleeps
with my daughter.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.151
Number three:
Sleep with my daughter,

19:13.153 --> 19:14.685
I pull off your fingers
with a socket wrench.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.454
Well, forget that,
'cause bam bam told us

19:16.456 --> 19:18.189
You already tried to bang her
two nights ago.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.958
That was before i knew
she was my daughter, okay?

19:20.960 --> 19:23.161
I thought she was just a hot
chick with a great-looking--

19:23.163 --> 19:24.262
No looking at her ass,
by the way.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.496
Or her tits.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.497
Matter of fact,
that word's out

19:26.499 --> 19:27.498
When she's in here.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.432
What word? Ass or tits?

19:28.434 --> 19:29.433
Both, all right?

19:29.435 --> 19:31.469
What about rack?

19:31.471 --> 19:32.970
Why would rack be okay?

19:32.972 --> 19:35.306
Puppies. She's got a great
set of puppies.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.440
Swear to god.
Stop right now.

19:36.442 --> 19:37.675
- Beams.
- Guns.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.943
- Grenades.
- Guys.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.211
- Cadillacs.
- Apples.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.612
Hey!

19:41.614 --> 19:42.947
No more nicknames
for my daughter's--

19:42.949 --> 19:43.948
Chesticles?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.516
Chest area.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.450
Okay?

19:46.452 --> 19:48.786
Enough. God.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.289
(bam bam)
what about her pussy?

19:51.291 --> 19:52.290
What?

19:52.292 --> 19:54.025
Like, if she
has a camel toe,

19:54.027 --> 19:55.960
May we say "camel toe"?

19:55.962 --> 19:57.061
Or ct?

19:57.063 --> 19:59.063
No camel toe.
No ct. Okay?

19:59.065 --> 20:00.631
How do we refer
to it, then?

20:00.633 --> 20:02.633
My daughter doesn't
have a pussy, okay?

20:02.635 --> 20:04.669
She has a vagina,
which is off-limits

20:04.671 --> 20:06.537
To each and every
one of you, all right?

20:06.539 --> 20:08.339
Well, johnny, you
should've thought of that

20:08.341 --> 20:11.509
25 years ago, when you
were banging our chicks.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.710
[bangs on drum]

20:12.712 --> 20:14.178
[sighs]

20:14.180 --> 20:15.479
Really, guys?

20:15.481 --> 20:19.584
Can we not just put
the past where it belongs?

20:19.586 --> 20:20.818
Huh?

20:20.820 --> 20:22.987
It was a quarter
of a century ago.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.789
[sighs]

20:27.827 --> 20:29.093
Of course we can, john.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.428
Thank you.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.996
But we're still gonna
need a code word

20:31.998 --> 20:33.564
For your daughter's pussy.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.765
Muff.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.267
Muff is not a code
word, asshole.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.568
- They know what that means.
- No, they do not.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.270
(bam bam)
absolutely they do.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.339
Oh, like you're some kind
of pussy-code-word genius.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.607
Actually, i am.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.108
- How 'bout pooch?
- I like that.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.343
- It's italian.
- Well, it's american.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.944
In ireland,
they say gee.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.346
- No, we're not--listen.
- Ooh, you're irish.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.880
- That means her vag is irish.
- Okay.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.850
[all speaking at once]

20:52.852 --> 20:54.785
And nobody's
looking at her...

20:54.787 --> 20:56.220
Puppies.

20:56.222 --> 20:57.455
What the hell are we
gonna look at, then?

20:57.457 --> 20:59.457
How 'bout her face,
asshole, okay?

20:59.459 --> 21:01.392
Ever heard of eye contact?
Huh?

21:01.394 --> 21:02.560
Assholes?

21:02.562 --> 21:05.363
Ooh, she does have
adorable eyes.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.364
No eye contact.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.431
There's no eye contact.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.733
(gigi)
i vote "pooch."

21:08.735 --> 21:11.135
Well, it sounds
so soft and fluffy.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.803
Here's the deal, though.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.239
My pooch is not
really up for grabs,

21:15.241 --> 21:16.974
And, knowing myself
as well as i do,

21:16.976 --> 21:18.309
I'm probably gonna
sleep with flash

21:18.311 --> 21:21.479
Because, well,
he's not bald.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.080
And he's not
the bass player.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.383
Plus, he's got this
slash-meets-joe perry

21:25.385 --> 21:27.318
Elder statesman rock god
kind of thing going on,

21:27.320 --> 21:29.587
Which the rest of you
absolutely do not.

21:29.589 --> 21:30.755
What are you
doing here?

21:30.757 --> 21:31.989
Oh. I invited him.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.257
I'm gonna
need a manager

21:33.259 --> 21:35.926
Once the music world
gets a load of me.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.062
So are we gonna
