WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.879
Heck, I had an abortion
when I was 15 years old.

00:03.961 --> 00:05.380
- Oh, she did not.
- Oh, my God.

00:05.464 --> 00:06.590
- Fuck!
- Yes!

00:08.967 --> 00:11.220
I chose you and I can't let this beat me.

00:11.303 --> 00:12.638
- "This" meaning me?
- Yes.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.973
More is gonna come out about Mitch.
That's inevitable.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.725
We need to have each other's backs.

00:16.808 --> 00:17.809
Protect the show.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.269
Yes. Protect the show.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.356
God, is it ever strange
being in his old dressing room?

00:22.439 --> 00:23.941
Yeah, sometimes it's weird.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.193
I wonder what happened in here
on a regular basis.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.570
Yeah, I wonder that.

00:29.321 --> 00:32.073
Was there something
about the culture at this show

00:32.156 --> 00:34.785
that made it feel impossible to complain?

00:34.868 --> 00:36.662
- Hey, tell her to stop.
- Bradley...

00:36.745 --> 00:38.080
Mia, don't stop her.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.207
You're safe and I don't want you
to say anything

00:40.290 --> 00:42.125
that you don't feel comfortable saying.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.169
- Bradley.
- But the truth matters.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.046
Bradley, stop this right now.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.715
He would call me in.
We would start kissing.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.217
I would give him oral sex.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.387
And I never told anybody,
but everybody knew.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.722
- Did you know?
- Excuse me?

00:55.806 --> 00:57.826
- About what was going on in his dressing room.
- About what was going on in his dressing room.

00:57.850 --> 00:58.850
How dare you?
﻿1

02:45.665 --> 02:46.875
That's our show for today.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.169
We are so glad
you spent your morning with us.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.046
And congratulations on your first week.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.982
- Yeah. Well done. Good job.
- Happy Friday, everyone.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.675
Thank you, guys. It's been a fun ride.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.510
Have a great weekend, America.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.304
And stay tuned for <i>The Twist</i>.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.519
Like they say, like Kelly says...
You know what I mean?

03:07.854 --> 03:09.647
I love this song.

03:09.731 --> 03:10.731
And we're out.

03:12.150 --> 03:16.905
Don't you ever, ever question
my integrity in my own house again.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.125
Okay. All right.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.462
Let me explain something to you
real quick.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.673
The business of this show
is a complicated world. Okay?

03:35.757 --> 03:37.342
There are rules we have to honor here.

03:37.425 --> 03:40.112
You may think you don't have to,
but you would be fucking wrong. Okay?

03:40.136 --> 03:42.013
This show, it will consume you,

03:42.097 --> 03:44.599
it will spit out
your bones and some gristle

03:44.682 --> 03:46.726
and your fucking spirit along with it.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.121
Unless that's what you're trying to
accomplish, in which case,

03:49.145 --> 03:50.605
I don't know what to tell you.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.401
- Chip, what are you trying to say?
- You could do great work here.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.653
Don't annihilate yourself in the process

03:56.736 --> 03:59.531
just for the sake of pushing buttons
that you aren't supposed to push.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.616
Be careful.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.786
Why? 'Cause if the network's found
culpable, you're the fall guy?

04:04.869 --> 04:05.954
It'll kill your career?

04:06.037 --> 04:09.374
Unfortunately, I think
that death ship is sailing as we speak.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.420
Look, not everybody's
a self-serving pile of shit.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.256
I'm talking to you about you.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.054
- Chip.
- Not now, Rena. I need five seconds...

04:23.138 --> 04:24.264
Mitch is here.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.103
Look at you, Mort. Nice scruff. I like it.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.188
Hey, Greg.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.441
Lindsey. How's the puppy?

04:34.524 --> 04:36.818
- She's good, Mitch.
- Remember, crate training.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.153
You have to crate train. Hey.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.654
Good morning. Good morning.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.615
What... Fuck me.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.785
Mitch?

04:47.495 --> 04:49.831
Hey there, Captain. How's the <i>Titanic</i>?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.708
Why are you here?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.543
I worked here for 15 years.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.626
There's something
I wanna say to these good people.

04:55.879 --> 04:59.090
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- I think it's a great idea.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.070
- Okay, call security.
- I already did.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.889
I'm staying with you.
I mean, I wanna see the show.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.642
Let's just hope the show doesn't involve
a sawed-off shotgun under his coat.

05:09.726 --> 05:10.726
God.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.812
Hello, everybody.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.276
Hi.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.365
You know,

05:23.448 --> 05:26.743
I noticed on the way in that
there aren't any pictures of me out there.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.161
What's going on with that?

05:28.244 --> 05:30.747
Who did that? Who did that?

05:31.289 --> 05:32.415
I'm kidding.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.751
Well...

05:36.669 --> 05:38.004
isn't this awkward?

05:40.298 --> 05:43.551
I know you're terrified to say anything,
so I'll do all the talking.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.598
This is so weird.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.684
First of all, I'm sorry.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.980
And when I say that,
I'm not admitting guilt or anything.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.984
I am sorry in the same way you might be
sorry for someone who was hit by a bus,

06:00.902 --> 06:02.654
even though you weren't driving the bus.

06:03.154 --> 06:06.366
So, I'm sorry that the show
got hit by a bus.

06:06.783 --> 06:07.909
We all got hit.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.287
Secondly,

06:12.414 --> 06:13.498
I...

06:15.500 --> 06:17.919
I really miss the shit outta you guys.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.258
I miss this place. I miss being here.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.593
I miss my partners.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.391
Hey, Alex.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.816
I heard that you did an interview
with one of my alleged victims

06:40.567 --> 06:43.087
and that there's a <i>New York Times</i> article
coming out imminently.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.615
And we all know how that's gonna go.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.618
I'm sure they're not
gonna do a feel-good piece about me.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.580
So that's the other reason I'm here.

06:54.581 --> 06:58.501
I am asking you to speak up on my behalf.

06:59.169 --> 07:03.631
Call the <i>Times</i>, go on record,
give 'em quotes.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.135
You guys know me better than anybody, so,

07:07.719 --> 07:08.803
out there,

07:10.180 --> 07:11.765
they're gonna blow this up.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.434
But you've worked with me.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.395
We have worked side by side
for years and years.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.773
We have shared family experiences.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.150
We are colleagues. We're friends.

07:22.233 --> 07:25.528
I'm asking you all, as friends,

07:25.945 --> 07:27.822
to speak out on my behalf.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.502
Mitch, this is not okay.
You need to leave.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.754
I know that some of you want to do it.

07:42.837 --> 07:46.132
I know that there are some of you
who want to speak up.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.967
No, no.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.844
This is scary. I get it.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.221
Going against the grain,

07:51.304 --> 07:53.473
saying things that are unpopular
in the moment

07:53.556 --> 07:56.059
about people that are unpopular
in the moment.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.437
But this is my fucking life!

08:02.357 --> 08:03.608
Who will speak up for me?

08:04.943 --> 08:07.737
Who here will speak up for me?

08:13.910 --> 08:17.706
You are the people
that I love in the world!

08:27.549 --> 08:28.550
Anybody?

08:29.801 --> 08:30.802
No?

08:32.137 --> 08:33.263
Wow.

08:35.598 --> 08:36.891
Okay.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.442
Alex?

09:04.669 --> 09:07.672
Okay. Listen, I get it.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.257
I understand.

09:10.467 --> 09:14.429
But from the bottom of my heart,
I just want you all to know...

09:16.222 --> 09:17.932
how important you are to me.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.854
But... I'm...
That's not to lay a guilt trip.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.482
I really do love you guys.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.861
And it's been an honor
working with all of you. Thank you.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.802
Mitch Kessler!

09:55.762 --> 09:58.014
If it isn't Bradley Jackson.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.395
Who else knew what was going on?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.693
Who do you think?

10:15.323 --> 10:16.741
Congrats on the chair.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.703
Keep your back to the wall.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.635
Bill! Bill?

10:41.099 --> 10:42.100
Hey.

10:42.726 --> 10:43.768
Hey.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.687
We were just talking about you.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.147
Oh, yeah?

10:47.689 --> 10:49.607
We think you are amazing.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.486
Really? I feel like everybody over there
wants to put my head on a spike.

10:54.029 --> 10:57.240
No. No, no, no. A lot of us
actually find you incredibly inspiring.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.410
Thank you for saying that.
I really appreciate it.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.705
Would you wanna come out with
some of us from the office tomorrow night?

11:03.788 --> 11:07.042
It's Claire's birthday,
and we're going drinking.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.753
It's your birthday.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.671
I'm sure you have
something much better to do.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.882
No. I actually have nothing to do.
I don't...

11:13.965 --> 11:16.468
I don't really know anybody here.
So I would love to come.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.554
I just have to move into my new hotel.
But what time?

11:19.971 --> 11:21.598
Nine-ish?

11:21.681 --> 11:22.807
- Yeah.
- Tom O'Donnell's.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.934
- Great, great.
- Birdly!

11:25.769 --> 11:29.397
I think that's me. I'm Birdly, I think.
Okay, I'll see y'all tomorrow night.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.816
- Bye, Birdly.
- Bye.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.568
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Enjoy.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.525
Holy shit.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.364
<i>And he did that to me.</i>

13:01.823 --> 13:04.576
<i>He branded me.</i>

13:04.659 --> 13:07.579
<i>He stole my self-confidence,
my self-worth.</i>

13:10.915 --> 13:12.000
<i>And then I was drowning,</i>

13:12.083 --> 13:14.544
<i>and there was no one
to throw me a lifeline.</i>

13:43.031 --> 13:44.616
Oh, my God.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.168
<i>Hello. Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

13:59.464 --> 14:02.258
Hey, it's Chip. Can you call me back?

14:03.009 --> 14:05.011
I could really use a favor.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.503
- Hey, Mia.
<i>- Good morning, Bradley.</i>

14:38.586 --> 14:40.940
Maggie Brener from <i>New York Magazine</i>
should be there any minute.

14:40.964 --> 14:42.549
I told the front desk to call you.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.135
Oh, yeah. I'm almost ready.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.095
<i>Listen. That Ashley interview.</i>

14:47.178 --> 14:49.597
<i>- We didn't get the chance to talk after.</i>
- I know, Mia.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.599
I'm not gonna say
what you think I'm gonna say.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.953
I thought it was a great interview.
I'm really proud of it,

14:53.977 --> 14:55.603
especially with Mitch showing up after.

14:55.687 --> 14:59.482
I mean, it's just a big fucking reminder
that what you did was right.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.901
I think he misses an audience.

15:01.985 --> 15:05.113
Yeah, well. Look what happened.
We all just sat there and listened.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.449
<i>Well, obviously we're gonna be curious.</i>

15:07.532 --> 15:11.619
Exactly. Which is why Maggie Brener
is gonna be curious, right?

15:11.703 --> 15:13.496
It's this fascinating car crash,

15:13.580 --> 15:15.457
and with Ashley's confession,

15:15.540 --> 15:18.301
it's just opened up the door
to more questions about <i>The Morning Show.</i>

15:18.334 --> 15:20.754
And she is gonna expect you
to answer them.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.299
What are you asking?

15:26.176 --> 15:28.470
I'm just asking
that you keep all that in mind.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.140
Maggie thinks she's smarter than everyone.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.979
<i>Well, I have no idea why</i>
The Morning Show<i> chose me.</i>

15:38.063 --> 15:41.649
I mean, I feel like sometimes
they got the wrong person or something.

15:41.733 --> 15:45.278
Like, someone's gonna call up
and tell me it was a big mistake.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.922
Well, that's part of your charm, right?

15:47.238 --> 15:50.784
The complete lack of pretense,
the self-effacing authenticity.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.702
Now, how do you hold on to all that?

15:53.953 --> 15:58.917
I mean, I don't know. I guess,
just don't believe your own press.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.169
Don't surround yourself with yes-people.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.713
Mainly I just think
we're all gonna end up dead,

16:03.797 --> 16:05.715
so there's no coming out on top anyway.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.967
You just can't get caught up
in all that bullshit.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.763
I probably shouldn't say "shit."

16:11.846 --> 16:14.307
That's okay. We all speak a little French.

16:15.892 --> 16:20.647
So, you change <i>The Morning Show</i>,
don't let <i>The Morning Show</i> change you?

16:21.606 --> 16:24.526
Well, I think we can evolve together.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.529
Right.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.908
But... Alex.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.412
I've known her for a long time.
She is a legend.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.496
She is.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.040
Do you think that she's up for this...

16:39.874 --> 16:43.044
<i>Morning Show</i> feminist revolution
that you've ignited?

16:44.462 --> 16:46.423
Especially in her own home.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.425
Oh, I think she is.

16:49.008 --> 16:53.221
But do you notice a shift
in the behind-the-scenes culture

16:53.680 --> 16:54.973
now that Mitch is gone?

16:55.473 --> 16:59.018
Or is that even possible given
that so much of the old guard remains?

16:59.436 --> 17:01.664
I wasn't there before,
so I can't really speak to a shift.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.982
But you were clearly
chasing that story yesterday

17:04.065 --> 17:05.692
in your interview with Ashley Brown,

17:05.775 --> 17:08.153
wondering at the culture

17:08.236 --> 17:11.614
that allowed Mitch's behavior
to go unchecked for a decade.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.701
So I think it's fair to assume
you're curious?

17:22.375 --> 17:25.211
Yeah, I'm human. And I'm a journalist.

17:25.295 --> 17:28.089
So when I see someone
who has a story to tell,

17:28.173 --> 17:30.759
I try to create space
for them to share it.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.721
Have you shared that space with Alex?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.727
She's been there longer than anyone.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.441
Yeah. Alex and I have
just started to work together.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.193
And I think we're off to a good start.

17:51.071 --> 17:55.158
I'm hopeful that we will prove
to be a very powerful team.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.371
Well, I look forward
to our ten-year follow-up interview.

18:00.038 --> 18:02.832
Let's see if everything works out
as you've intended it to.

18:10.632 --> 18:14.177
<i>We gave you the thrust of it.
There were four accusers who came forward,</i>

18:14.259 --> 18:17.514
two by name. And after Ashley,
we now have two more women

18:17.596 --> 18:19.099
who are willing to go on record.

18:19.182 --> 18:22.393
Allegations of misconduct and harassment
by Mitch.

18:22.477 --> 18:23.644
Some went through channels.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.605
We're giving you eight hours
to respond with a quote from Fred.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.067
They need to give us the fucking details.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.903
I need to know what's in the story,
how exposed we are.

18:31.986 --> 18:32.987
Agreed.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.448
Otherwise I won't validate this
with a quote.

18:42.163 --> 18:45.125
Okay, Rob.
Let's just cut to the chase here.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.711
You know that we're not gonna
let Fred give you a quote

18:47.794 --> 18:49.838
if he doesn't know the content.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.381
<i>Hey, we're calling as a courtesy.</i>

18:51.464 --> 18:53.341
Our story plays
with or without the quotes.

18:53.425 --> 18:54.968
But you should think of optics.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.220
People will know
that Fred is trying to duck out.

18:57.804 --> 18:58.888
<i>Duck out from what?</i>

18:58.972 --> 19:02.225
<i>There's a million vague stories
going around. Yours isn't special.</i>

19:02.308 --> 19:06.271
If you had something to say that was new
or explosive, then you'd be telling us.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.612
Here's what we have.
Four sources of quotes.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.115
Three are women who work
or have worked on the show,

19:17.198 --> 19:19.826
one from a male
who currently works on the show.

19:19.909 --> 19:23.455
These events took place
in his dressing room, in his car,

19:23.872 --> 19:26.166
<i>on location, in hotels,</i>

19:26.249 --> 19:29.002
<i>in a Chevron bathroom
on a remote in Northern California</i>

19:29.085 --> 19:30.670
<i>during the Shakespeare Festival,</i>

19:30.754 --> 19:33.256
in Rome during the papal conclave,

19:33.339 --> 19:36.134
a weekend at his vacation home
in the Hamptons,

19:36.217 --> 19:38.470
<i>and numerous incidents on his yacht.</i>

19:39.179 --> 19:40.346
Extra, extra.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.934
Anybody can say anything.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.228
<i>Is any of this credible?</i>

19:47.312 --> 19:49.856
It's some direct quotes
and some second-party.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.318
One of them is Fred's old assistant,
Janine Friedman.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.488
Mitch fucked Janine? Jesus.

19:56.571 --> 19:58.490
<i>What's the quote from Friedman?</i>

20:00.658 --> 20:04.704
Janine stated, "There was always an
environment of protection for the stars.

20:04.788 --> 20:07.123
I'm not speaking
directly about sexual allegations,

20:07.207 --> 20:11.336
<i>but obviously the stars are the bread and
butter, and they are fiercely protected.</i>

20:11.419 --> 20:14.464
I know there were always rumors
about what Mitch was doing.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.383
It was common knowledge."

20:17.842 --> 20:21.471
What about if we trade the story
of Mitch coming to the set yesterday

20:21.554 --> 20:24.641
and getting escorted off by security
for dropping the quote?

20:27.435 --> 20:28.812
- Text him.
- Yeah.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.565
This is exciting.

20:40.323 --> 20:41.366
Listen.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.160
We have a story that's
a perfect addition to this piece.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.038
<i>It's directly about Mitch,
and it's eyewitnesses.</i>

20:47.747 --> 20:48.957
That's fantastic.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.792
<i>But you have to drop the Friedman quote.</i>

20:50.875 --> 20:52.675
I need to hear it
before I can make that deal.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.629
No, that's not gonna happen.

20:54.713 --> 20:57.132
I promise you,
it's going to make the piece sing.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.475
Fuck 'em. They're bluffing.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.354
Sorry, we're gonna run the piece as is.
Thank you.

21:12.647 --> 21:14.065
What the hell?

21:18.361 --> 21:20.321
You need to do anything
you can to stop this.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.633
Discredit people making the allegations,
call our sources.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.617
Do what you have to do
to get people to retract.

21:24.701 --> 21:28.079
<i>Buy them off. But stop this
from happening immediately,</i>

21:28.163 --> 21:30.331
or you're gonna be looking for new jobs.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.844
I'm really fucking sick of you
and sick of your shtick.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.971
I know you think you're a genius.

21:45.388 --> 21:48.725
I have chewed through seven different
versions of guys like you in my career.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.062
So stop acting like
you're the second coming of the Lord.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.231
The truth is, nobody likes you.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.650
Well, maybe your mother does,

21:57.734 --> 22:00.862
but I guess she didn't
pay enough attention to you, and...

22:02.155 --> 22:04.157
now we all have to suffer because of it.

22:18.296 --> 22:19.839
May I enter my lady's chamber?

22:19.923 --> 22:23.468
So polite of you. Yes, please. Come in.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.137
I'm getting my game face on.

22:26.221 --> 22:27.806
Game face.

22:28.223 --> 22:30.850
There was me thinking
this was a delightful charity fund-raiser.

22:30.934 --> 22:31.935
No, it is. It is.

22:32.018 --> 22:35.522
Unfortunately, I have to do some
old-fashioned stroking

22:35.605 --> 22:37.857
of Maggie Brener's oversized ego.

22:37.941 --> 22:39.317
Oh, to what end?

22:39.401 --> 22:42.153
Well, she interviewed Bradley today
for <i>New York Magazine,</i>

22:42.237 --> 22:44.864
and I just, I just have to make sure
I'm all over it.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.617
Always something exciting
to look forward to.

22:48.076 --> 22:50.870
You have armies to conquer.
Look your best.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.248
You're supposed to say I already do.

22:53.331 --> 22:55.250
- You already do.
- Thank you.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.848
<i>Bradley, it's your dad.</i>

23:10.682 --> 23:16.187
<i>I'm here in my car.
And I thought I'd give you a call.</i>

23:19.024 --> 23:20.984
Chip, that Ashley Brown interview.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.402
My God.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.237
I know. It's a real barn burner, huh?

23:24.320 --> 23:28.616
Yeah. Well, you guys promised
transparency after Mitch, but... Jesus.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.952
Look, let's just cut to it.

23:31.036 --> 23:34.247
The article you're dropping,
with more Mitch accusers...

23:34.706 --> 23:36.124
You want to comment on the record?

23:37.792 --> 23:40.192
No, I want you to tell me
what's about to fuck me up the ass.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.881
You weren't listening in on the call?

23:48.386 --> 23:49.429
Sorry.

23:50.597 --> 23:51.848
All right, fuck it.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.434
How exposed is the network?

23:54.517 --> 23:56.895
The show?
I mean, how exposed am I, Robbie?

23:57.687 --> 23:59.731
You gotta give me something, please.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.691
I mean, how long have we been friends?

24:01.775 --> 24:04.295
We chased the same stories.
We stayed in the same shitty motels.

24:04.319 --> 24:06.112
You've met most of my ex-wives.

24:06.196 --> 24:09.741
I've done shit for you.
I helped you get this job.

24:10.867 --> 24:13.244
We know the culture wasn't perfect
at the show,

24:13.328 --> 24:15.246
but we did not know everything.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.248
And we are cleaning it up.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.753
Gotta help me.
It's quid pro quo. It's what we do.

24:24.798 --> 24:25.799
I'm sorry, Chip.

24:26.549 --> 24:29.302
Really? You're sorry?
After what I gave you?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.390
I don't remember what you gave me.

24:34.057 --> 24:35.642
Wasn't that the deal?

24:37.936 --> 24:41.773
I'm not asking you
to compromise the piece.

24:41.856 --> 24:43.983
Just don't shoot me in the fucking face.

24:45.318 --> 24:46.528
You owe me that.

24:49.698 --> 24:51.449
That might compromise the piece.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.873
I know where your skeletons are buried,
my friend.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.876
I'd think about what you're doing.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.850
Welcome. May I take your coat?

25:18.435 --> 25:19.978
Permission granted.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.565
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

25:23.648 --> 25:24.691
You're welcome. Enjoy.

26:00.393 --> 26:03.521
This gives you the warning.
Cory just walked in.

26:07.984 --> 26:10.528
- Okay. Game face.
- The smile.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.788
Hello, Cory. So glad that you could come.

26:19.871 --> 26:22.290
Oh, Alex, if only you meant that.

26:22.374 --> 26:24.834
I know you only invited me
for political reasons.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.920
Oh. Well, true.

26:27.379 --> 26:29.255
But let's just pretend maybe I didn't.

26:29.672 --> 26:30.882
It might be more fun.

26:36.096 --> 26:38.640
Oh, and you can sing
a show tune for a donation.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.851
What about "The Waltz of Treachery"?

26:42.477 --> 26:43.561
<i>Les Mis</i>?

26:43.978 --> 26:48.274
Very inside baseball, that selection.
I'm impressed.

26:48.358 --> 26:49.776
Likewise.

26:50.235 --> 26:53.113
I guess we do have
something in common after all.

26:53.196 --> 26:54.531
Who knew?

27:04.708 --> 27:05.709
Manhattan?

27:08.086 --> 27:09.212
When in Rome.

27:10.547 --> 27:12.090
So good to see you.

27:12.173 --> 27:14.175
- Hi, Geneva.
- Hi.

27:15.093 --> 27:16.261
You're here.

27:16.344 --> 27:19.347
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you so much for doing this, Alex.

27:19.431 --> 27:20.951
Yes, thank you. Place looks beautiful.

27:21.015 --> 27:22.475
Thank you. Thank you.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.561
- How is everything?
- Okay.

27:24.644 --> 27:27.313
- Yeah?
- Okay, well, actually, not okay.

27:27.397 --> 27:31.026
Have you heard about these wildfires
outside of Los Angeles, California?

27:31.109 --> 27:32.444
I know. They're horrible.

27:32.527 --> 27:35.780
Well, apparently, they're just a few miles
from our Malibu home.

27:35.864 --> 27:37.824
- No. I'm so sorry.
- We'll be fine.

27:37.907 --> 27:40.493
We have a hysterical neighbor
who loves the drama.

27:40.577 --> 27:43.038
But I really hope you're right, Fred.

27:43.788 --> 27:47.792
I hope you get to relax.
That's what tonight is all about. Okay?

27:48.460 --> 27:50.837
Bid on something, Fred. Don't be cheap.

27:52.380 --> 27:54.090
Why does everyone think I'm so cheap?

27:54.716 --> 27:56.134
Because you are, dear.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.225
- Thank you.
- Do you come here often?

28:05.977 --> 28:08.229
Yeah. You actually look
kinda familiar to me.

28:08.313 --> 28:09.314
Buy you a drink?

28:09.647 --> 28:12.567
I'd love to. But I'm too busy
controlling the universe.

28:13.026 --> 28:14.277
Of course you are.

28:15.362 --> 28:17.113
Have you seen Maggie yet?

28:18.156 --> 28:20.241
God. She better fucking show.

28:20.325 --> 28:22.911
Yeah. How's the old game face holding up?

28:22.994 --> 28:26.664
My game face is fantastic.
I'm doing great.

28:26.748 --> 28:29.268
You know that I always know how
to pull it together when I have to.

28:29.292 --> 28:30.293
Yes, I do.

28:30.377 --> 28:32.462
Yes. But you know what's driving me crazy?

28:32.545 --> 28:35.256
Everybody. All they wanna do
is talk about Bradley Jackson.

28:36.007 --> 28:39.386
"This Bradley, she's amazing."
"Oh, my God. What a find."

28:39.844 --> 28:42.263
"Bradley, she's just like a revelation."

28:42.347 --> 28:43.848
"What a firecracker."

28:43.932 --> 28:45.350
It's fucking bullshit.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.645
I swear to God. I'm the one who found her,

28:48.728 --> 28:51.231
- and no one seems to remember that.
- I remember it.

28:52.107 --> 28:54.109
Anyhow, speech time.

28:54.192 --> 28:56.111
So, deep breath.

28:56.194 --> 28:59.864
Look both ways.
Wear a helmet and just be careful.

29:00.407 --> 29:02.742
Oh, come on. Don't worry.
I'm almost always careful.

29:02.826 --> 29:04.035
"Almost."

29:04.119 --> 29:05.412
Okay.

29:09.290 --> 29:10.625
Excuse me.

29:10.709 --> 29:13.795
Hello, everyone.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna sing.

29:15.505 --> 29:19.426
I just wanted to take a moment to thank
all of you for coming out tonight.

29:19.509 --> 29:23.596
And a very special thanks
to Geneva Micklen, who introduced me

29:23.680 --> 29:28.685
to this wonderful foundation
and the reason we are all here tonight.

29:29.519 --> 29:30.812
Thank you.

29:30.895 --> 29:32.981
The New York Theatre Development Fund

29:33.064 --> 29:36.484
seeks to bring the power of theater
to everyone.

29:36.568 --> 29:39.779
They provide scholarships
for underprivileged drama students

29:39.863 --> 29:41.531
and future theater performers.

29:41.614 --> 29:44.534
So, please check out the auction room.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.703
There are some fantastic pieces in there.

29:47.454 --> 29:49.831
And Christian will be here all night.

29:49.914 --> 29:54.252
So, for a $1000 donation, you can
sing one of your favorite show tunes.

29:54.335 --> 29:57.839
Like Cheyenne Jackson did so beautifully
just before.

29:58.423 --> 30:01.217
Yes, and there will be desserts
passed around, drinks.

30:01.301 --> 30:03.720
And just please enjoy yourselves and...

30:04.596 --> 30:06.222
long live Broadway.

30:07.223 --> 30:08.600
Thank you. Enjoy.

30:09.809 --> 30:12.020
- You did so well. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.709
- Hey.
- Hey, what can I get ya?

30:35.710 --> 30:39.130
What do you have for a social obligation
I'm not emotionally equipped to be at?

30:39.589 --> 30:42.425
Jameson.
It got us through the social obligation

30:42.509 --> 30:44.189
of lying to the British for quite a while.

30:44.594 --> 30:47.180
Perfect. I'll have that on the rocks.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.681
Actually, make it a double.

30:48.765 --> 30:51.935
A double? I'll run a tab for ya.

30:52.936 --> 30:54.187
Great. My name's Bradley.

30:54.604 --> 30:55.647
I'll remember ya.

30:56.147 --> 30:57.941
All right. Wish me luck.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.067
Good luck.

31:02.487 --> 31:04.155
That's Bradley Jackson.

31:04.239 --> 31:06.616
Bradley's here. How did that happen?

31:06.700 --> 31:08.243
Oh, yeah, Claire and I invited her.

31:08.326 --> 31:10.995
She actually showed up? Interesting.

31:11.079 --> 31:13.349
- Oh, my God. I love that hair.
- Who wants another round?

31:13.373 --> 31:16.751
You like it? The network made me
look like a tool. So, I changed it.

31:16.835 --> 31:18.920
Anyway, thank you for having me.

31:19.003 --> 31:20.004
Happy birthday, Claire.

31:20.088 --> 31:21.548
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

31:21.631 --> 31:23.633
- To Claire. To Claire.
- Thank you.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.802
- To Claire.
- Thank you very much.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.804
- Cheers.
- We were just about to play

31:27.887 --> 31:31.725
"Take a shot for every time you hit on
someone at a workplace in the old days."

31:33.017 --> 31:34.697
- In the old days.
- Anybody need anything?

31:34.728 --> 31:37.439
- Tequila.
- Tequila.

31:37.522 --> 31:39.816
Yes, tequila.
And then we're gonna put it on my card,

31:39.899 --> 31:41.693
and I'm gonna keep it open all night.

31:41.776 --> 31:42.777
My name is Bradley.

31:43.403 --> 31:45.947
- Ms. Jackson.
- Ms. Jackson if you're nasty.

31:47.532 --> 31:49.701
Oh, my God.

31:49.784 --> 31:51.703
You nasty, Layla. I see you.

31:52.787 --> 31:55.582
How does he know who I am?
This is so weird.

31:55.665 --> 31:57.876
- Get used to it.
- That's what this is for.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.062
Takes the edge off the things
you don't like thinking about.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.672
Cheers to that, my friend. To denial.

32:02.756 --> 32:04.424
Denial!

32:04.507 --> 32:09.512
<i>Yes, I</i>

32:19.147 --> 32:20.440
<i>Can</i>

32:20.523 --> 32:25.695
<i>Yes, she can</i>

32:28.239 --> 32:30.992
You're too good. That was so silly.

32:33.828 --> 32:35.163
Tequila on the rocks, please.

32:36.456 --> 32:39.417
Daniel, you're too talented.

32:40.210 --> 32:43.254
Well, I'm no Neil Diamond, but I do okay.

32:43.671 --> 32:46.424
No, the singing was great,
but what I meant was you're too talented

32:46.508 --> 32:49.886
to be waiting around for some white folks
to play chess to decide your future.

32:50.512 --> 32:52.639
It is good to see you, Audra.

32:53.348 --> 32:54.784
So, where's the rest of the <i>YDA</i> team?

32:54.808 --> 32:58.520
Well, Jimmy's grandmother's home is
in the path of the California wildfires.

32:58.603 --> 33:00.665
So, he went out to make sure
that everything was okay.

33:00.689 --> 33:02.232
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

33:02.315 --> 33:03.475
Yeah, we'll see what happens.

33:03.525 --> 33:04.734
What I was getting at was

33:04.818 --> 33:07.112
there is something
that I would like to discuss with you.

33:07.195 --> 33:08.196
Okay.

33:08.988 --> 33:13.535
Preferably not in an environment
that is teeming with <i>TMS</i> overlords.

33:13.618 --> 33:16.830
Look,
<i>TMS</i> has been my home for a long time,

33:16.913 --> 33:20.208
and I don't think
my work here is done just yet.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.168
Do you feel appreciated?

33:22.711 --> 33:23.920
I feel motivated.

33:24.796 --> 33:27.841
Okay, keep telling yourself that.
Come talk to me.

33:33.346 --> 33:37.475
Hey. Why don't you be a good gay
and come listen to show tunes with me?

33:38.017 --> 33:39.894
- Sure.
- Okay, come on.

33:40.645 --> 33:41.789
- Painful, right?
- Brutally painful.

33:41.813 --> 33:43.249
Oh, no. There's nothing much left now.

33:43.273 --> 33:45.859
- All right. So, are you gonna sing?
- Please, make him sing.

33:45.942 --> 33:46.943
Oh, please. Come on.

33:47.027 --> 33:49.863
I'm thinking "Modern Major General"
'cause I can talk-sing it,

33:49.946 --> 33:51.382
and I learned it in boarding school.

33:51.406 --> 33:55.243
So, it's either that, or any musical
that Rex Harrison ever sang in. We'll see.

33:55.326 --> 33:56.494
Gilbert and Sullivan.

33:56.578 --> 33:59.372
What a crowd-pleaser.
I can't wait for that.

33:59.456 --> 34:01.207
- It'll be good, Yanko.
- Okay. Sure.

34:01.291 --> 34:03.626
Oh, Maggie. Okay, have fun.

34:04.127 --> 34:06.838
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hi, Alex.

34:07.672 --> 34:09.466
- How are you?
- Beautiful party.

34:09.549 --> 34:12.385
- And beautiful men.
- I know. Always.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.472
You are such a champ for being here.

34:15.555 --> 34:18.933
I know that you already had a full day
with my new partner in crime.

34:19.017 --> 34:20.351
She's quite something, huh?

34:20.769 --> 34:22.228
Bradley, yeah.

34:22.312 --> 34:25.899
- Yeah, she's an interesting find.
- Yes, I know. I know.

34:27.317 --> 34:28.318
Is she here?

34:29.694 --> 34:30.987
- Okay.
- Nope, she's not here.

34:31.071 --> 34:33.615
No, she actually
is taking a night for herself.

34:33.698 --> 34:36.534
- Which she has earned.
- Good for her.

34:36.618 --> 34:39.704
It must've been quite the week
being shot outta the <i>TMS</i> cannon.

34:39.788 --> 34:40.955
It was a tough week for her.

34:41.581 --> 34:46.252
And, I mean, she's extremely talented,
but she got quite shell-shocked

34:46.336 --> 34:48.256
when I told her
that she had to go on air Monday.

34:48.338 --> 34:49.798
Who wouldn't be? So...

34:51.633 --> 34:53.301
You made the Monday call?

34:53.802 --> 34:55.637
Yeah, I know what the show needs.

34:55.720 --> 34:58.098
You know, a fast, fresh start.

34:58.181 --> 35:01.976
Feminist slant. And it couldn't
happen faster in my opinion.

35:02.644 --> 35:05.063
And Bradley came through like a superstar.

35:05.146 --> 35:09.567
I mean, for someone who has
zero anchor experience, she did great.

35:10.985 --> 35:13.988
Well, clearly guided
by the steady hand of someone

35:14.072 --> 35:16.353
who has been through the wringers
of the industry herself.

35:16.407 --> 35:20.161
Well, yes. I mean, you know this, Maggie.

35:20.244 --> 35:23.248
It's never straightforward
when women try to take control

35:23.331 --> 35:26.376
of a male-dominated empire, you know?

35:26.459 --> 35:28.628
But we made history with that interview.

35:30.003 --> 35:32.882
You're already a royal we? That's cute.

35:32.965 --> 35:33.967
Thank you.

35:34.717 --> 35:38.722
I mean, come on, you really think
that I wouldn't take a firm hand

35:38.805 --> 35:41.516
in an interview that had stakes that high?

35:42.267 --> 35:45.228
I mean, I worked with Bradley all week,
I guided her,

35:45.979 --> 35:48.773
trying to get to the truth
of Ashley's experience.

35:49.482 --> 35:54.320
And it was intense. And it was tough.
But we, I... We got there.

35:55.864 --> 35:58.116
Is this supposed to be on the record?

36:01.578 --> 36:02.579
No.

36:03.747 --> 36:06.041
I just thought
that you would be interested

36:06.124 --> 36:09.377
in the changes that were happening
over at <i>TMS.</i>

36:11.629 --> 36:16.092
I mean, I myself felt certain constraints
sitting next to Mitch.

36:17.135 --> 36:20.305
And now, I finally have an opportunity
to make things better over there

36:20.388 --> 36:22.390
for women, and for myself.

36:25.268 --> 36:27.771
- What?
- Alex, we've known each other too long.

36:28.897 --> 36:30.815
I have tremendous respect for you, but...

36:31.775 --> 36:35.779
I am not going to write
some feminist puff piece

36:35.862 --> 36:37.155
about a woman...

36:38.698 --> 36:42.369
who turned a blind eye
to the sexual misconduct of her cohost.

36:46.206 --> 36:47.499
Excuse me?

36:47.582 --> 36:50.377
Bradley's profile is gonna be great.

36:53.129 --> 36:55.799
I don't blame you
for being worried about getting lost,

36:55.882 --> 36:59.886
the fear that someone sitting next to you
is your replacement.

37:01.846 --> 37:03.890
I know this is really hard for you.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.977
Would you like to comment on that?

37:12.148 --> 37:13.900
Off the record, Maggie.

37:14.859 --> 37:16.861
I'm not afraid about getting lost.

37:18.822 --> 37:19.948
Anywhere.

37:20.740 --> 37:21.866
Ever.

37:23.743 --> 37:25.161
Enjoy the party.

37:32.752 --> 37:35.022
I still haven't heard anything
about the <i>Times</i> pulling back.

37:35.046 --> 37:36.756
Fuckers. Have you?

37:36.840 --> 37:39.342
No, not a word. Fuckers.

37:40.176 --> 37:42.470
Hey, you just missed
the press photographer, Chip.

37:42.554 --> 37:43.555
Shall I call her back?

37:43.638 --> 37:47.809
We can all be in the Gala section of <i>W</i>
looking like the rich assholes we are.

37:49.227 --> 37:52.397
I think I'm more comfortable
being an off-camera asshole. Thank you.

37:53.023 --> 37:54.149
You're here pretty late.

37:54.774 --> 37:56.276
I'm here pretty drunk.

37:57.402 --> 38:00.905
Drinking seemed more pressing tonight
for some reason.

38:03.033 --> 38:04.159
I'm gonna go find Geneva.

38:05.535 --> 38:09.789
You know, just... I didn't really
appreciate being left off the <i>Times</i> call.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.418
You weren't needed.

38:14.294 --> 38:15.545
I know what you're doing.

38:15.628 --> 38:17.380
You're waiting
for that article to come out,

38:17.464 --> 38:19.817
and then if it's bad for you,
I don't have a job in the morning.

38:19.841 --> 38:21.217
Am I right?

38:26.723 --> 38:27.932
I guess I'm right.

38:29.809 --> 38:31.770
Sorry, Charlie "Chip" Black.

38:33.063 --> 38:34.105
Are you really?

38:34.189 --> 38:35.899
I think I actually am.

38:36.816 --> 38:40.570
Okay. Well, just so you know,
you're not immune here.

38:41.279 --> 38:43.865
You're just as fucking expendable as I am.

39:02.092 --> 39:03.301
Hey, you good?

39:04.094 --> 39:06.846
Please. What, are you
in the 12-step program?

39:06.930 --> 39:12.143
- Wanna make amends to me? Cory.
- No, Alex, now hold on just a minute.

39:12.227 --> 39:17.065
Come on. Let 'em get a picture
of us talking, you know?

39:18.608 --> 39:19.818
Smiling...

39:22.779 --> 39:25.448
Yeah, are you good?

39:26.574 --> 39:29.744
I can't remember the last time
that we actually talked.

39:30.829 --> 39:32.706
What do you... What do you want, Cory?

39:32.789 --> 39:36.084
It was right before you announced Bradley
as your cohost.

39:36.167 --> 39:40.630
- And I was pretty awful to you.
- You were a dick.

39:40.714 --> 39:44.217
Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite.
I just wanted you to hear it from me.

39:45.885 --> 39:48.054
- Okay, and what is that?
- You were right.

39:50.140 --> 39:51.850
Yup, I said it.

39:53.685 --> 39:57.480
You did a good thing.
That Bradley stunt was brilliant.

39:57.981 --> 40:01.818
And I want us to find a way
to work together.

40:04.112 --> 40:07.365
I think you're kind of a crazy genius,

40:07.449 --> 40:11.745
and I like working with crazy geniuses.

40:18.835 --> 40:20.545
Go fuck yourself, Cory.

40:20.962 --> 40:23.506
Save your energy for your next kill.
I'm not biting.

40:24.132 --> 40:26.259
- You don't believe me.
- No.

40:26.342 --> 40:29.054
Oh, Alex.

40:30.430 --> 40:32.182
I'm gonna try a little harder.

40:39.981 --> 40:43.276
Everybody, can I get your attention
for a second, please?

40:45.195 --> 40:51.117
I just want to take a second
to acknowledge our hostess tonight.

40:51.201 --> 40:55.455
Alex, what would we do without you?
To Alex, everyone.

40:56.623 --> 41:00.210
Wow. Thank you.
That's so nice. Thank you.

41:01.628 --> 41:05.090
I dedicate this song to you, Alex Levy.

41:05.173 --> 41:08.009
You make my job so fun.
You're gonna like this one.

41:08.426 --> 41:09.594
What are you doing?

41:11.012 --> 41:14.015
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you</i>

41:14.516 --> 41:17.602
<i>- Not while I'm around</i>
- Oh, good God.

41:20.021 --> 41:23.525
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you No, sir</i>

41:23.608 --> 41:26.319
<i>Not while I'm around</i>

41:27.821 --> 41:31.991
<i>Demons are prowling everywhere</i>

41:32.075 --> 41:35.829
<i>Nowadays</i>

41:36.871 --> 41:40.875
<i>I'll send them howling
I don't care</i>

41:41.459 --> 41:44.212
<i>- I've got ways</i>
- Yes, you do.

41:45.922 --> 41:49.217
- You know this is a duet, Alex Levy.
- God, no. No way.

41:49.300 --> 41:52.180
Come on. You're the musical theater nerd!
You gotta get in there! Go, go!

41:52.262 --> 41:57.392
<i>No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare</i>

42:00.270 --> 42:05.525
<i>Others can desert you
Not to worry, whistle, I'll be there</i>

42:05.608 --> 42:07.569
She knows the words, everyone!

42:08.278 --> 42:12.198
<i>Demons will charm you with a smile</i>

42:12.282 --> 42:14.576
<i>For a while</i>

42:14.659 --> 42:18.955
<i>But in time</i>

42:20.415 --> 42:24.377
<i>Nothing can harm you</i>

42:25.086 --> 42:32.093
<i>Not while I'm around</i>

42:35.638 --> 42:38.767
<i>Being close and being clever</i>

42:38.850 --> 42:41.436
<i>Ain't like being true</i>

42:42.270 --> 42:45.648
<i>I don't need to I would never</i>

42:45.732 --> 42:51.821
<i>Hide a thing from you, like some</i>

42:56.743 --> 42:59.079
What the fuck is going on right now?

42:59.162 --> 43:02.665
I don't know, but it's weird
and fascinating, and I'm super into it.

43:02.749 --> 43:05.668
<i>No one's gonna dare</i>

43:07.545 --> 43:09.464
<i>Others can desert you</i>

43:09.547 --> 43:13.385
<i>Not to worry
Whistle, I'll be there</i>

43:15.345 --> 43:19.349
<i>Demons will charm you with a smile</i>

43:19.432 --> 43:21.393
<i>For a while</i>

43:21.476 --> 43:25.897
<i>But in time</i>

43:27.607 --> 43:31.861
<i>Nothing can harm you</i>

43:32.696 --> 43:34.572
<i>Not while</i>

43:34.656 --> 43:41.621
<i>I'm around</i>

44:03.768 --> 44:05.019
Bravo, Alex!

44:17.949 --> 44:18.950
Yeah?

44:21.661 --> 44:24.247
Yes, I absolutely am ready
to give you that quote.

44:24.330 --> 44:25.999
And you'll lose the Friedman quote?

44:26.416 --> 44:29.961
What changed? Fine, fine, don't tell me.

44:31.004 --> 44:33.006
Perfect. You ready?

44:35.425 --> 44:38.094
Alex. Alex, what is going on?

44:38.178 --> 44:40.013
I have to get out of here.

44:40.096 --> 44:42.515
This is your party.
What am I supposed to tell people?

44:42.599 --> 44:45.143
Tell them to wrap it up.
Tell them to stop fucking singing.

44:45.226 --> 44:48.021
- Wait. Did something happen?
- Something happens every five minutes.

44:48.104 --> 44:50.666
I need some air. I cannot be in the same
room with all those people right now.

44:50.690 --> 44:52.793
I'm at a loss here.
How is being out on the street better...

44:52.817 --> 44:55.403
- What the fuck is going on, Alex?
- I'm going to see Mitch!

44:56.029 --> 44:57.030
All right?

44:57.822 --> 44:59.366
I need to talk to him.

44:59.449 --> 45:00.950
He's in the city.

45:01.034 --> 45:04.162
We have a lot going on right now.
And I just want to fucking talk to him.

45:04.245 --> 45:06.165
I want to see my friend.
Is that a fucking crime?

45:06.206 --> 45:08.291
No, no, not a crime.

45:09.501 --> 45:13.296
Then, please, don't turn this
into something that it's not.

45:14.089 --> 45:15.215
I won't.

45:15.757 --> 45:19.594
Go on, off you go. I will lie for you,
and take care of your party.

45:20.512 --> 45:21.679
Thank you.

45:30.730 --> 45:35.276
So, now no one can ever have a fling
with someone sexy they work with?

45:35.360 --> 45:39.781
It isn't that hard to hook up with people
who you don't have to see every day.

45:39.864 --> 45:42.200
With what free time exactly?

45:42.283 --> 45:44.828
Celibacy has its perks.

45:44.911 --> 45:46.037
Like?

45:46.705 --> 45:48.289
I do not know.

45:49.499 --> 45:51.793
Please. What does any of it matter?

45:51.876 --> 45:54.838
Men put their dicks in a bunch of places
they don't belong.

45:54.921 --> 45:57.799
But who amongst us could say
we wouldn't be doing the same

45:57.882 --> 45:59.843
if we were differently equipped?

45:59.926 --> 46:02.637
- Hannah.
- It's what being a man is all about,

46:02.721 --> 46:04.973
and that is never really gonna change,

46:05.056 --> 46:08.643
no matter what lies we tell ourselves,
no matter what stories we do about it.

46:08.727 --> 46:11.021
So... mazel tov!

46:12.230 --> 46:13.857
You're a nihilistic drunk, Hannah.

46:14.524 --> 46:16.651
- Fucking right, babe.
- And I love it!

46:17.652 --> 46:21.072
It would help if the security guard could
keep Mitch out of the fucking building.

46:21.740 --> 46:25.410
It was so sad. His face.
And he remembered about my dog.

46:25.493 --> 46:28.455
No. What was fucking sad
was all the people who tried to pretend

46:28.538 --> 46:31.416
like they didn't know or participate
in what Mitch was doing.

46:31.499 --> 46:33.209
So, it wasn't just Mitch.

46:33.293 --> 46:35.086
Mitch was the only one that was going...

46:35.170 --> 46:37.714
Hold on. Who wants to know?

46:38.339 --> 46:39.340
I'm sorry?

46:42.052 --> 46:45.889
What Rena means is, does Bradley Jackson
the truth teller want to know,

46:45.972 --> 46:50.018
or Bradley Jackson the human being out
for a night of revelry with her coworkers?

46:51.186 --> 46:52.479
Really?

46:53.355 --> 46:54.856
Y'all, I've worked in enough places.

46:54.939 --> 46:57.692
I would be shocked if it was just Mitch.
Shocked.

46:57.776 --> 47:02.322
But not everyone here does live interviews
trying to get to the truth.

47:02.405 --> 47:04.824
Are you saying
I shouldn't have asked her to be honest?

47:04.908 --> 47:08.870
I think some of us just love our jobs,
imperfect though they may be.

47:10.330 --> 47:14.167
Okay, listen. I'm not trying to double
or triple fuck any of y'all.

47:14.250 --> 47:17.253
I am just a witness to history here,
just like the rest of you.

47:17.337 --> 47:20.465
<i>Vive la révolution!</i> Off with his balls.

47:21.424 --> 47:24.844
No offense, Claire, but give it ten years,
see if you feel the same way.

47:24.928 --> 47:28.223
You know,
maybe you have too much perspective

47:28.306 --> 47:31.851
and too many years of being trained
to enable this behavior in men.

47:31.935 --> 47:34.187
- Jesus, Claire.
- What the fuck does that mean?

47:34.270 --> 47:36.648
No, I'm not blaming you,
but I certainly hope

47:36.731 --> 47:39.317
I'd still wanna
cut off Mitch's balls in ten years.

47:39.401 --> 47:40.902
He'll still be a fucking creep.

47:43.988 --> 47:46.282
First of all, how old are you? What, 24?

47:46.366 --> 47:49.285
Actually, why don't you try
giving it 20 years.

47:49.369 --> 47:52.330
And with all due respect,
you've been in your job... 18 months?

47:52.414 --> 47:55.458
What the fuck do you know about this show,
what it's been, what I have seen?

47:55.542 --> 47:58.712
What I have gone through
since I've been on this show.

47:59.129 --> 48:03.091
Okay, with all due respect, you don't have
to have worked here for 20 years

48:03.174 --> 48:04.926
to know that what Mitch did was fucked up.

48:05.009 --> 48:06.302
Okay, let's just...

48:06.386 --> 48:08.096
Obviously, no one is disputing that,

48:08.179 --> 48:11.766
but it's not as black-and-white
as you are stating it.

48:12.100 --> 48:15.395
Right? 'Cause this shit is complicated.
People are complicated.

48:15.478 --> 48:16.771
Mitch was complicated.

48:19.274 --> 48:21.067
And he was a part of this show.

48:21.151 --> 48:22.485
And I care deeply...

48:25.905 --> 48:27.198
for this show.

48:35.457 --> 48:37.375
Okay. Mia, I'm really...

48:37.459 --> 48:39.794
I'm really drunk. I'm sorry.
We're all drunk and...

48:39.878 --> 48:42.797
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
I apologize to all of you, right?

48:42.881 --> 48:46.342
This is hard for me. I feel bad for...

48:49.471 --> 48:52.807
I feel bad 'cause, you know,
that <i>Times </i>article is gonna be...

48:54.601 --> 48:56.269
gonna be hard to come back from.

49:00.148 --> 49:01.983
For us or for Mitch?

49:09.491 --> 49:12.744
You know what? I'm gonna call myself
a Lyft 'cause I need a lift.

49:13.703 --> 49:15.038
I'm sorry, Mia.

49:15.121 --> 49:17.207
No, no, it's fine. It's fine.

49:18.666 --> 49:19.751
Forgive me.

49:21.002 --> 49:22.462
Sorry, sorry.

49:22.879 --> 49:25.423
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

49:26.049 --> 49:27.050
Thank you.

49:30.762 --> 49:32.847
- Bye, Mia.
- Yes. See you tomorrow.

49:32.931 --> 49:35.183
- Okay. Bye, Mia.
- Okay. Bye. Bye.

49:38.812 --> 49:41.690
I'm really sorry
I said to cut off his balls.

50:02.252 --> 50:04.796
I'm glad you called.
This conversation is scintillating.

50:06.131 --> 50:09.384
God. I was literally just thinking

50:09.467 --> 50:12.512
how nice it is to be so comfortable
with someone

50:12.595 --> 50:15.640
that you can just sit in silence
and not have to talk.

50:15.724 --> 50:18.017
You called the wrong guy.

50:19.561 --> 50:22.188
I've been making
a lot of wrong calls lately.

50:22.272 --> 50:24.983
Yeah. I wanted to ask you about that.

50:25.066 --> 50:27.068
What the fuck is with
this Bradley Jackson person?

50:27.152 --> 50:30.363
- Don't ask.
- What, was that a network move?

50:30.447 --> 50:32.741
That was me. That was a me move.

50:33.408 --> 50:37.662
I sprung that on 'em at that
dumb journalist event the other night.

50:37.746 --> 50:40.123
- It was this...
- No shit. Really?

50:40.206 --> 50:41.207
Yes, I did.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.960
Oh, gosh. And you know what?

50:44.044 --> 50:48.548
Now, there is absolutely no turning back.
Nope.

50:48.631 --> 50:51.217
The wheels really came off your world
when I left, didn't they?

50:51.301 --> 50:53.261
They flew right off. I mean, I don't...

50:53.344 --> 50:55.638
Would you like to hear
my honest opinion on this?

50:56.681 --> 50:57.682
Is that rhetorical?

50:57.766 --> 50:59.809
- Yes, of course it is.
- Of course it is.

50:59.893 --> 51:03.271
She's not gonna last,
and you have to prepare yourself for that.

51:03.355 --> 51:06.066
Because people are so fucking stupid,

51:06.149 --> 51:09.069
they see something that's loud
and in their face, and they're,

51:09.152 --> 51:10.403
"Wow, what's this?"

51:10.487 --> 51:13.466
Then they realize that they don't like
things that are loud and in their face,

51:13.490 --> 51:14.949
and they move on.

51:15.033 --> 51:17.535
So, I suggest that you just

51:17.952 --> 51:21.247
keep your distance,
lest you get chunks of Bradley Jackson

51:21.331 --> 51:23.166
getting in your hair when she implodes.

51:23.249 --> 51:25.627
- Oh, God, lovely.
- Well...

51:25.710 --> 51:28.213
I can see it. Okay, and then what?

51:28.296 --> 51:31.508
Assuming that I'm not covered
in Bradley Jackson remains,

51:31.591 --> 51:33.259
which is a big assumption.

51:33.343 --> 51:35.136
Life goes on, you know?

51:35.220 --> 51:36.763
People continue to watch the show

51:36.846 --> 51:39.265
'cause it helps them digest
the horrors of the world,

51:39.349 --> 51:42.519
and you are gonna come out
smelling like a rose.

51:42.602 --> 51:46.773
They are gonna love you even more
after Bradley Jackson crashes and burns.

51:46.856 --> 51:49.943
And after the debacle, known as "me,"

51:50.735 --> 51:54.447
you're gonna be the wise one,
the solid one, the smart one,

51:54.864 --> 51:56.658
the one that they can count on,

51:57.075 --> 51:58.868
the one who survived it all,

51:59.369 --> 52:00.870
the one who never changed.

52:08.336 --> 52:11.339
And then you'll find a new coanchor,
probably a man.

52:12.382 --> 52:17.011
And as ridiculous as it sounds right now,
probably gonna be a straight, white man,

52:17.095 --> 52:20.265
gonna be handsome,
not too handsome, not intimidatingly so,

52:20.348 --> 52:21.891
just sort of a...

52:21.975 --> 52:24.686
like your best friend's father
you always sort of had a crush on.

52:24.769 --> 52:28.481
And he's gonna be really smart,
and he's gonna be a journalist,

52:28.565 --> 52:34.279
and he's not gonna be one of these
just camera bimbos.

52:34.362 --> 52:37.157
He's gonna have some real depth to him.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.784
And the two of you
are gonna get along great.

52:40.410 --> 52:43.830
And you guys will make each other laugh,
on the air and off the air.

52:43.913 --> 52:46.374
You're not getting your job back.

52:46.791 --> 52:49.169
- Me? I'm not talking about me.
- Never. No.

52:49.252 --> 52:51.254
I'm just talking about this nameless,
other person.

52:51.337 --> 52:54.883
This other person
who lives in a house of fun mirrors.

52:56.551 --> 52:59.054
Oh, really? Don't we all?

52:59.137 --> 53:01.765
Yes, I know. Fair enough.

53:14.319 --> 53:15.945
You miss me.

53:16.696 --> 53:19.949
Admit it. You do. I can tell.

53:20.033 --> 53:21.117
You called me.

53:22.243 --> 53:24.788
Would you just drive
the fucking car, dipshit?

53:25.872 --> 53:27.123
You know what?

53:27.207 --> 53:29.292
I have an idea. We could go out.

53:29.751 --> 53:32.128
Paige is gone. And you're separated.

53:32.837 --> 53:35.006
Oh, my gosh. Mitch, do you hear yourself?

53:35.090 --> 53:36.716
We're unattached.

53:36.800 --> 53:40.720
This is the first time ever that we're
both unattached, so we could do this.

53:40.804 --> 53:44.307
I mean...
Yes, I'm sure it's every girl's dream

53:44.391 --> 53:46.017
to settle down with a sexual predator.

53:46.101 --> 53:50.647
And have... just have two-and-a-half
little predators of her own, and...

53:51.272 --> 53:52.273
Okay.

53:52.357 --> 53:56.319
But I think the world holds me
to a higher standard than that.

53:56.820 --> 53:59.989
Yeah, well, you're right. It does.

54:08.248 --> 54:10.083
There's life after the show, though.

54:11.626 --> 54:14.921
It doesn't sound half bad to me.
I can think of worse things.

54:27.100 --> 54:28.226
Thank you.

54:31.396 --> 54:32.897
I do miss you.

54:33.481 --> 54:35.108
I really miss you, too.

54:41.072 --> 54:42.532
I'm sorry.

55:18.568 --> 55:20.320
Oh, Mitch. The story just dropped.

55:20.403 --> 55:21.863
Oh, shit.

55:25.742 --> 55:26.743
Well, fuck.

55:30.622 --> 55:32.624
<i>Guys. The </i>Times<i> piece. It's out.</i>

55:32.707 --> 55:33.833
Oh, shit.

55:41.383 --> 55:45.637
Oh, my God. The papal conclave?
I think I know who this was.

55:46.179 --> 55:48.556
"The woman said Mr. Kessler asked her

55:48.640 --> 55:51.976
to join him in the gas station bathroom."
Jesus.

55:52.894 --> 55:56.898
"In spite of Bradley Jackson's
explosive interview with Ashley Brown,

55:57.399 --> 56:01.611
no further incidents
of a cover-up climate were reported."

56:21.256 --> 56:22.424
I'll be right back.

56:38.064 --> 56:39.441
Hello?

56:39.524 --> 56:41.443
<i>Hey, Dad?</i>

56:41.943 --> 56:45.238
It's me. It's... Bradley.

56:46.865 --> 56:49.200
I hope it's not a bad time.

56:50.869 --> 56:52.370
Why are you calling me?

56:52.454 --> 56:55.457
Well, that's a good question.

56:58.334 --> 57:01.713
I guess...
I guess it's been a while. I guess...

57:02.630 --> 57:04.591
<i>I wasn't sure you wanted to talk to me.</i>

57:05.717 --> 57:08.386
Yeah. You just wanted to call
and chat after 15 years?

57:11.848 --> 57:13.516
You sound like you're at a bar.

57:14.225 --> 57:15.477
Well, you would know.

57:18.063 --> 57:19.647
All right, I'm sorry.

57:20.315 --> 57:22.776
I'm just... I'm calling you because...

57:25.362 --> 57:29.949
because I was thinking of you.
I'm always thinking of you.

57:31.826 --> 57:33.953
<i>And I've been watching your program.</i>

57:34.829 --> 57:38.041
<i>And maybe it's selfish of me,
but I wanted to call,</i>

57:39.000 --> 57:41.211
<i>and I wanted to tell you how proud,</i>

57:42.670 --> 57:44.172
<i>how very...</i>

57:46.925 --> 57:50.929
How proud, how very proud I am.

57:51.012 --> 57:52.931
I wish your grandmother could see you.

57:56.059 --> 58:00.980
<i>I always knew that you were so smart,
Bradley.</i>

58:02.899 --> 58:03.900
<i>The way you would...</i>

58:05.193 --> 58:08.488
you would debate politics with me
when you were little.

58:09.364 --> 58:11.032
<i>It's not that I'm...</i>

58:11.116 --> 58:16.579
<i>I'm taking credit for
how extraordinary you turned out to be.</i>

58:18.164 --> 58:20.125
No, quite the opposite.

58:21.543 --> 58:27.424
No. Considering where you came from
and how far you've come...

58:30.385 --> 58:32.303
I put you through hell.

58:37.559 --> 58:38.977
Are you still there?

58:43.273 --> 58:45.108
I put you through some hell, too.

58:47.569 --> 58:49.612
You did what you thought you had to do.

58:54.075 --> 58:55.618
I did what I had to do.

58:57.078 --> 58:58.580
Look, you can't call me.

58:59.622 --> 59:02.459
You didn't call Mom, did you?
'Cause you know she's pretty fragile.

59:04.419 --> 59:06.379
No, I've not called her, I'm...

59:07.422 --> 59:09.049
I don't wanna make any trouble.

59:09.132 --> 59:11.051
Well, then don't, okay? I gotta go.

59:11.134 --> 59:13.094
<i>Okay. Good night.</i>

59:14.387 --> 59:15.847
Take care of yourself, kiddo.

59:19.017 --> 59:20.268
I always have.

59:44.167 --> 59:47.379
- Hey.
- Hey. Can I get a drink?

59:50.048 --> 59:51.508
It's on the house.

59:56.304 --> 59:58.556
- One more?
- Yeah. Just keep it coming.

59:58.640 --> 1:00:00.100
- All right.
- What's your name?

1:00:00.183 --> 1:00:01.893
- It's Andrew.
- Andrew.

1:00:01.976 --> 1:00:04.145
- Yeah. What's your name?
- I'm Bradley.

1:00:04.229 --> 1:00:05.706
- Actually, I've run your card...
- Oh, yeah?

1:00:05.730 --> 1:00:06.970
Which I still have, by the way.

1:00:29.087 --> 1:00:30.839
Okay. All right.

1:00:34.217 --> 1:00:35.719
- I gotta go.
- You gotta what?

1:00:35.802 --> 1:00:38.722
- Yeah.
- You gotta be kidding me.

1:00:49.190 --> 1:00:51.943
That... fucking asshole.

1:01:00.035 --> 1:01:02.370
I... I really... I need to go home.

1:01:02.454 --> 1:01:04.956
Come on, Alex.
You knew all about this stuff.

1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:07.083
I knew it, yeah.

1:01:08.585 --> 1:01:12.047
I knew about it in theory,
but just reading this

1:01:12.130 --> 1:01:14.215
just felt really, really different.

1:01:14.299 --> 1:01:16.342
- Can you just please...
- Okay. Okay.

1:01:16.426 --> 1:01:18.428
I need to go home, Mitch. Please.

1:01:18.928 --> 1:01:20.346
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:01:25.602 --> 1:01:26.603
Okay.

1:02:10.522 --> 1:02:12.375
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson.
I can't give you his room number.

1:02:12.399 --> 1:02:14.567
Yes, you can. I live here. He lives here.

1:02:14.651 --> 1:02:16.420
He's my neighbor.
I have a right to know his address.

1:02:16.444 --> 1:02:19.364
No one is disputing he stays here.
I just can't give you his room number.

1:02:19.447 --> 1:02:21.425
Then just call him
and tell him that I'm down here.

1:02:21.449 --> 1:02:23.219
I'm not gonna call
'cause I know he's not up there.

1:02:23.243 --> 1:02:24.786
- Why do you keep saying...
- Bradley.

1:02:24.869 --> 1:02:27.205
- So sorry I'm late.
- Cory.

1:02:27.288 --> 1:02:30.291
I told him I knew you,
but he wasn't listening.

1:02:30.375 --> 1:02:32.335
Yeah, my apologies.
Come with me, all right?

1:02:32.419 --> 1:02:33.586
- So rude.
- It's okay.

1:02:33.670 --> 1:02:36.089
Don't worry about that guy.
He's just doing...

1:02:36.172 --> 1:02:37.632
I'm glad I found you.

1:02:37.716 --> 1:02:41.094
I'm hearing, from that conversation,
that you're living here now, huh?

1:02:41.177 --> 1:02:44.347
- Yeah. They moved me here.
- All right. What room are you in?

1:02:44.431 --> 1:02:45.682
I live upstairs.

1:02:47.559 --> 1:02:48.601
Okay.

1:02:49.227 --> 1:02:50.979
You wanna tell me what happened?

1:02:52.439 --> 1:02:54.065
- No. I don't know.
- All right.

1:02:54.149 --> 1:02:57.819
I do know. I did something
really fucking stupid.

1:02:57.902 --> 1:02:59.487
It's okay. Here. Hold on.

1:02:59.571 --> 1:03:03.658
- I fucked this bartender.
- Okay, well...

1:03:03.742 --> 1:03:05.618
And I'm not sorry that I fucked him.

1:03:05.702 --> 1:03:08.246
I'm just worried because,

1:03:08.329 --> 1:03:10.415
I don't know,
I guess I'm famous now or something,

1:03:10.498 --> 1:03:11.708
I don't know.

1:03:11.791 --> 1:03:15.503
I'm so...
I just don't know what I'm doing.

1:03:15.587 --> 1:03:18.214
No, no. Hey. Hey. It's okay. Come here.

1:03:18.298 --> 1:03:19.299
Lean on me.

1:03:20.091 --> 1:03:21.593
It's all right. I gotcha.

1:03:22.469 --> 1:03:25.597
- Don't you worry, okay?
- I'm just embarrassed.

1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:29.225
Don't be. I got you. It's gonna be okay.

1:03:50.538 --> 1:03:52.999
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Hey, yeah, Fred. It's Mitch.

1:03:53.083 --> 1:03:55.085
"Fred Micklen told the <i>Times</i>,

1:03:55.168 --> 1:03:57.879
'He came to the studio
in an emotional state.

1:03:57.962 --> 1:03:59.422
He had to be escorted out.

1:03:59.506 --> 1:04:03.176
It's painful to watch,
but his own actions brought him to this.

1:04:03.259 --> 1:04:05.845
He's done. He'll never work again.'"

1:04:08.765 --> 1:04:12.805
If I'm going down,
you are going down with me.

1:04:15.855 --> 1:04:19.567
You are going down, motherfucker.
