WEBVTT

01:01.729 --> 01:03.731
You're the third
emperor of Rome

01:03.865 --> 01:05.132
whom I've served.

01:05.265 --> 01:07.334
First there was Caligula,

01:07.467 --> 01:09.369
then Claudius,

01:09.503 --> 01:11.338
and now you, Nero.

01:18.613 --> 01:21.649
You send General Lucius
Caesennius Paetus

01:21.783 --> 01:25.019
to defend Armenia against
the might of Parthia?

01:25.153 --> 01:27.922
I'm the one who invaded
Armenia in the first place.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.470
I don't goddamn believe it.

01:44.337 --> 01:46.741
I don't fucking believe it!

01:51.278 --> 01:52.714
What's goin' on?

01:57.417 --> 02:01.189
I should be the one
to repel the Parthians,

02:01.321 --> 02:03.356
not that cocksure Paetus.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.694
And you order me
to safeguard what, Syria?

02:06.828 --> 02:07.962
From who?

02:12.566 --> 02:16.236
Parthians are besieging
our legions in Armenia.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.540
And there's a heavy
winter coming.

02:20.675 --> 02:23.177
You better hope, Emperor,
that the power of Rome

02:23.310 --> 02:27.215
rests solely, not in the hands
of your appointed generals,

02:27.347 --> 02:29.984
but in the hearts of those
anonymous soldiers

02:30.118 --> 02:32.754
who make up your legions.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.638
Oh.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.291
Proceed, Marcus.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.459
What is the latest?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.494
A new message
from the Parthians.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.563
They demand we surrender.

04:23.698 --> 04:24.966
They give us three days.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.667
They guarantee we will not
be killed if...

04:26.801 --> 04:27.969
Burn it.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.904
Surrender is not an option.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.039
- General...
- I said no!

04:32.173 --> 04:33.573
Damn it.

04:45.385 --> 04:48.189
The Parthians control
the pass.

04:48.322 --> 04:51.125
The Scythians have cut off
our supply route here.

04:51.259 --> 04:54.328
If we don't get help,
we'll die of starvation.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.231
Do you also think
that this is all my fault,

04:57.365 --> 04:59.466
for making camp

04:59.599 --> 05:02.603
in a place
that can easily be besieged?

05:02.737 --> 05:05.373
That this is all the result
of my incompetence?

05:05.505 --> 05:07.574
This is no time
to look back.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.778
We're in no position
to sustain a prolonged siege.

05:10.912 --> 05:13.480
Our own men remain loyal,
but the mercenaries

05:13.614 --> 05:16.150
- have deserted.
- God damn mercenaries.

05:16.284 --> 05:18.019
Any word from Corbulo?

05:18.152 --> 05:21.255
I sent three of my best men
as emissaries.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.590
They all chose
separate routes.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.425
But the mountains are thick

05:25.558 --> 05:27.361
with enemies familiar
with our plans.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.297
They all failed.

05:29.429 --> 05:32.266
There is one final option.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.304
Take the only route the enemy
will not expect us to take.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.438
A handful
of well-prepared men

05:38.571 --> 05:40.507
could scale the ravine.

05:42.475 --> 05:45.680
Once in the forest,
it's a seven-day

05:45.813 --> 05:49.449
forest march to Syria
and Corbulo's scouts.

05:49.582 --> 05:51.385
Are you telling me, Marcus,

05:51.551 --> 05:53.220
that a few of our men,

05:53.354 --> 05:55.222
exhausted and starving to death,

05:55.356 --> 05:57.825
will be able
to scale a cliff,

05:57.959 --> 06:00.194
walk and run
through the forest,

06:00.328 --> 06:01.662
battle the enemy,

06:01.796 --> 06:04.732
and reach Syria
in just a few days?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.435
Precisely.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.470
I can see that I'm not the
only one who has lost his head.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.872
It's the only route

06:12.006 --> 06:14.008
that will not be crawling
with the enemy.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.476
Meanwhile,
we can make them believe

06:16.610 --> 06:18.779
we're contemplating
the terms of the surrender.

06:18.913 --> 06:21.215
Corbulo, that bastard.

06:23.351 --> 06:26.887
I never imagined that
my greatest political foe

06:27.021 --> 06:30.257
would one day be
my only hope for survival.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.827
And what if,
after all this...

06:34.594 --> 06:37.365
he refuses to come
to our aid?

06:37.497 --> 06:39.100
It's a risk we have to take.

06:41.335 --> 06:43.270
The route is impossible.

06:45.373 --> 06:47.274
Have you already considered

06:47.408 --> 06:50.911
whom to entrust
with this lunacy?

06:51.045 --> 06:53.214
He is a soldier,

06:53.347 --> 06:55.515
raised in the mountains
of North Hispania.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.952
Excellent climber and fighter.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.456
Highly revered
by the auxiliary cohorts.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.492
Auxiliary cohorts?

07:04.625 --> 07:05.926
He might desert.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.461
He is a soldier.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.363
Loyal to Rome.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.598
There are others,
younger, stronger.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.566
But none with his capacity
to endure.

07:13.701 --> 07:16.137
What's his name?

07:16.270 --> 07:17.738
They call him Noreno.

07:20.408 --> 07:22.076
Do you think he will do it?

07:25.913 --> 07:28.449
If it's an order,
he'll obey it to the end.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.651
Yes, an order.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.920
Duty.

07:33.054 --> 07:35.823
A soldier's lot is nothing
but to obey orders,

07:35.956 --> 07:39.260
to fight and sacrifice
one's life

07:39.393 --> 07:40.593
without thinking.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.797
What is hard
is to make decisions.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.498
They must leave tonight.

07:44.632 --> 07:47.134
We are all already dead, Marcus.

07:47.268 --> 07:49.036
Your plan is impossible.

07:50.805 --> 07:53.607
I can already see Corbulo

07:53.741 --> 07:55.509
as he hears the news
of my defeat,

07:55.643 --> 07:57.711
the outcome
of my strategic blunder.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.847
His smile.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.217
We are going to need
great assistance from the gods,

08:04.418 --> 08:07.455
if we are basing our hopes

08:07.587 --> 08:09.190
on a mountain man.

08:10.124 --> 08:12.660
But if the gods
are willing...

08:14.195 --> 08:15.329
so be it.

08:51.265 --> 08:54.001
Sir,
Noreno the soldier is here.

09:01.442 --> 09:02.743
Noreno.

09:06.615 --> 09:07.748
You called for me, sir.

09:07.882 --> 09:09.283
You've been selected

09:09.416 --> 09:11.852
to deliver a message
to General Corbulo.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.092
The others failed

09:18.225 --> 09:20.227
because they chose
a wrong route.

09:20.361 --> 09:22.863
You'll go by one
the enemy does not expect.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.365
Through the ravine.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.668
Sir,

09:27.801 --> 09:29.703
what you ask of me
is impossible.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.072
Impossible or not,
that's our only chance

09:32.206 --> 09:33.374
to survive.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.747
I am aware
of your qualities.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.916
I didn't select you
for your obvious skills.

09:42.049 --> 09:45.753
You were chosen because of
your rare capacity to endure.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.788
If anyone can succeed...

09:50.224 --> 09:51.458
it's you.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.229
We have provisions
for only two more days.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.998
If the enemy doesn't
kill us, then...

09:58.132 --> 10:01.001
the lack of food
or the cold will.

10:01.135 --> 10:03.437
The entire Roman legion

10:03.571 --> 10:05.272
destroyed, disgraced.

10:05.406 --> 10:07.141
You must succeed.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.443
- When do I leave?
- Now.

10:09.577 --> 10:11.579
When you leave the camp,

10:11.712 --> 10:14.081
run straight for the ravine.

10:14.215 --> 10:17.151
Scale its walls.
Once in the forest, head southwest

10:17.284 --> 10:19.987
till you hit Syria
and Corbulo's scouts.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.991
Help me return to Rome.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.897
Help me see my son.

10:30.965 --> 10:32.466
I will do my best.

10:37.371 --> 10:40.174
When you reach Corbulo,
give him this.

10:41.075 --> 10:44.011
That parchment
bears Paetus' seal.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.260
Oh, may the gods
protect you.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.663
Go out from here and run

11:01.795 --> 11:04.531
as if Hades himself
were pursuing you.

12:41.696 --> 12:43.197
For Rome!

12:59.246 --> 13:01.081
I'm sorry, my friend!

13:08.857 --> 13:10.124
Go!

13:12.159 --> 13:13.494
Run!

13:22.704 --> 13:23.904
Come on.

13:39.888 --> 13:41.188
No!

14:21.061 --> 14:22.196
<i>Si?</i>

14:40.113 --> 14:41.616
Another idiotic Roman

14:41.749 --> 14:44.585
who believes he can cross
these terraces to seek help.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.357
What do I do with him, Saka?

15:00.869 --> 15:03.203
Damn proud Romans.

15:03.337 --> 15:04.973
When are they ever
going to stop?

15:05.105 --> 15:07.842
Their pride
is what makes them great.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.094
They can't go far.

15:29.864 --> 15:31.365
Look over there.

15:44.946 --> 15:46.179
Here.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.782
Here's the famous ravine.

16:05.867 --> 16:07.067
Go!

21:22.917 --> 21:24.886
Two of the Romans
are dead.

21:25.820 --> 21:27.955
The other scaled
the cliff face.

21:28.089 --> 21:29.522
That route is impossible.

21:29.657 --> 21:30.791
Nothing is impossible

21:30.925 --> 21:32.592
if you have the will
to survive.

21:33.728 --> 21:35.462
They're just deserters.

21:38.132 --> 21:41.202
They sacrificed themselves
so that he could succeed.

21:41.335 --> 21:43.337
He's making his way
to Corbulo.

21:43.470 --> 21:47.141
The Persians pay us to kill
Romans, not to let them escape.

21:47.275 --> 21:50.177
Madyes, you and Saulio
make your way to the river.

21:50.311 --> 21:52.613
He'll have to cross it
eventually.

21:54.015 --> 21:56.516
I'll send word
to the Persians.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.030
Yeah, for now.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.702
So Claudius, tell me,

22:14.835 --> 22:17.905
how far have you traveled
to arrive at the frontier?

22:18.039 --> 22:19.874
Hibernia.

22:20.007 --> 22:21.309
Hibernia?

22:21.441 --> 22:23.644
That's the edge
of the world.

22:23.778 --> 22:26.147
What's a Celt doing
at the Roman auxiliary?

22:26.280 --> 22:28.049
I heard the pay was good.

22:28.182 --> 22:29.216
Pay.

22:33.287 --> 22:34.889
Like most children...

22:35.022 --> 22:37.625
on the coast of Hibernia,
I was captured

22:37.758 --> 22:39.727
and taken to Britannia
as a slave.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.762
I was a game keeper's
ward but...

22:42.830 --> 22:45.166
they couldn't hold me.

22:49.003 --> 22:51.872
He says do you...
did you ever want to return home?

22:53.407 --> 22:55.776
I was away from home
too long.

22:55.910 --> 22:58.779
I wanted to see the world.

22:58.913 --> 23:01.248
So, I made my way to Gaul

23:01.382 --> 23:04.785
and joined the auxiliary.

23:04.919 --> 23:07.487
They've been the only family
I've ever known.

23:07.621 --> 23:09.256
And for that I'm thankful.

23:16.063 --> 23:17.665
He says you should've gone
to Hispania.

23:17.798 --> 23:19.367
It's his land.
Very beautiful there.

23:22.403 --> 23:25.106
Um, I was raised by
my grandfather in Hispania.

23:25.239 --> 23:27.375
And, uh, when he joined
the auxiliary,

23:27.507 --> 23:29.143
he was stationed
in Britannia.

23:29.276 --> 23:32.545
So I followed him
and fought alongside him.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.448
However, when he died,

23:34.581 --> 23:37.451
I decided I would return
to Hispania.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.620
I carried his body
to the top of the mountain

23:39.754 --> 23:41.789
and there I laid him down

23:41.922 --> 23:44.625
so the vultures could carry
his soul to the afterlife.

23:44.759 --> 23:46.593
However, when I returned
to the auxiliary,

23:46.727 --> 23:48.329
I met Marcus.

23:48.462 --> 23:51.165
He recognized
my ability and...

23:51.298 --> 23:53.768
well he gave me
a purpose.

23:58.305 --> 24:01.609
Oh, oh, I think he means,
uh, for Rome.

24:01.742 --> 24:03.543
- <i>Si? Si?</i>
- Uh, for Rome.

24:03.677 --> 24:04.879
- Yes.
- For Rome?

24:05.012 --> 24:05.846
- For Rome.
- Rome!

24:05.980 --> 24:08.015
For Rome!

30:58.959 --> 31:00.294
Let her go!

31:02.730 --> 31:03.698
Get out.

32:58.478 --> 33:00.247
Do you live here alone?

33:02.316 --> 33:03.818
Where is your family?

33:17.531 --> 33:18.866
Noreno.

33:22.737 --> 33:24.304
Duria.

35:45.813 --> 35:47.547
I wouldn't do it!

35:51.451 --> 35:53.320
Look! Let me go.

35:54.689 --> 35:57.158
I don't have anything
to give you.

35:57.290 --> 35:59.060
I know that you're
a deserter but...

35:59.193 --> 36:01.595
believe me when I say...

36:01.729 --> 36:03.731
I will not tell anyone
where you are.

36:04.431 --> 36:05.733
I will not betray you.

36:07.534 --> 36:08.703
Do you think
I'm actually afraid

36:08.836 --> 36:10.537
you'll tell someone
where I am?

36:12.305 --> 36:14.208
I'm not that important
that in...

36:14.341 --> 36:16.409
they'll need
to send soldiers after me.

36:16.543 --> 36:18.880
I have no interest
in what made you desert.

36:20.214 --> 36:21.749
But let me go.

36:21.883 --> 36:23.684
You will have helped save
an isolated legion

36:23.818 --> 36:25.186
that has no chance
of survival.

36:25.318 --> 36:27.420
I don't care about you

36:27.554 --> 36:29.422
or your damn legion.

36:29.556 --> 36:32.627
Now let's see what
you've got in the bag.

36:37.564 --> 36:40.001
A message with a Roman
general's seal on it.

36:41.769 --> 36:43.436
I should be able to get
something nice for this.

36:43.570 --> 36:45.206
You take what you like,

36:45.338 --> 36:47.440
but you leave me that.

36:47.574 --> 36:48.643
Try to remember
that you were

36:48.776 --> 36:50.178
a legionnaire, too.

36:50.310 --> 36:53.014
Rome and all her glory

36:53.147 --> 36:54.514
can burn in hell,

36:54.649 --> 36:56.316
for all I care.

39:59.166 --> 40:00.134
Thank you.

40:10.311 --> 40:11.245
Thank you.

44:11.885 --> 44:14.188
<i>A soldier's life
is lived outdoors,</i>

44:14.321 --> 44:16.857
<i>in every damn
imaginable weather.</i>

44:19.760 --> 44:22.196
<i>I'm sure that's something
you can't imagine, Nero.</i>

44:27.001 --> 44:29.036
<i>But when you're
a Roman soldier...</i>

44:32.840 --> 44:34.541
you get used
to your hardships...

44:38.178 --> 44:39.480
<i>and what doesn't kill you</i>

44:39.614 --> 44:41.315
only makes you stronger.

45:36.437 --> 45:37.838
Look over there.

49:46.888 --> 49:47.689
Who the hell are you?

49:50.658 --> 49:51.726
Let me go.

50:32.566 --> 50:34.234
Please. I beg of you.

50:34.368 --> 50:36.203
I'm a Roman soldier.

50:36.336 --> 50:37.672
I'm on a mission of mercy.

50:37.805 --> 50:40.140
My men have no food
and no water.

50:40.273 --> 50:42.142
Nobody cares.

50:42.275 --> 50:43.745
Least of all me.

50:43.878 --> 50:45.145
I just wanna sell you.

50:45.278 --> 50:46.914
Scyles.

50:49.917 --> 50:52.754
How the hell did you get all
the way out here with just this?

50:53.353 --> 50:54.822
Scyles!

50:54.956 --> 50:56.223
Shit.

50:56.356 --> 50:58.626
That man belongs to me!

50:58.760 --> 51:01.896
Yeah? Well these
bonds say otherwise!

51:03.131 --> 51:05.432
You're getting old
and slow, Medea.

51:06.968 --> 51:08.603
Turn around.

51:08.736 --> 51:10.772
Go back to your woman,
Solias.

51:12.940 --> 51:14.274
Oh, wait...

51:16.010 --> 51:17.511
You can't.

51:18.278 --> 51:19.546
I killed her.

51:22.249 --> 51:24.184
This world is mine.

51:24.317 --> 51:25.987
Anyone who comes
across this patch

51:26.120 --> 51:27.822
belongs to me.

51:28.522 --> 51:31.258
She wandered too far!

51:31.391 --> 51:34.294
And now,
she paid the price.

51:35.429 --> 51:38.166
This bounty is mine.

51:38.298 --> 51:40.835
And I am claiming my reward!

54:12.385 --> 54:14.088
Take my hand.

54:16.324 --> 54:17.892
Take it!

55:53.654 --> 55:55.990
Steady, soldier.

55:56.123 --> 55:57.358
Stay calm.

55:57.524 --> 55:59.459
You're safe.

56:00.493 --> 56:02.363
Rest.

56:02.495 --> 56:04.932
No, I cannot rest.

56:05.598 --> 56:07.534
Where am I?

56:08.369 --> 56:09.536
How long have I been here?

56:09.670 --> 56:11.839
No one is following you.

56:13.341 --> 56:14.742
Stay still.

56:15.309 --> 56:17.845
You are safe here.

56:17.979 --> 56:18.913
Shh.

56:19.046 --> 56:20.181
You are safe.

56:21.581 --> 56:23.384
<i>"There was
nothing to animate</i>

56:23.516 --> 56:25.386
<i>the drooping spirits
of the army</i>

56:25.518 --> 56:27.221
but the example
of their general,

56:27.355 --> 56:28.488
who endured even more

56:28.622 --> 56:30.191
than the common
soldiers did."

56:31.659 --> 56:33.361
That was written about me,

56:33.493 --> 56:35.930
about my conquests
of Armenia,

56:36.063 --> 56:39.066
whose future Paetus
now holds in the...

56:39.200 --> 56:42.003
in the palm
of his grubby little hand.

56:47.341 --> 56:49.877
When our long
arduous march

56:50.011 --> 56:51.412
took us through
hot, desolate

56:51.544 --> 56:53.280
and rugged countryside,

56:54.648 --> 56:58.419
with food
and water scarce,

56:58.551 --> 57:01.322
and the Armenians
likely to launch

57:01.455 --> 57:03.991
an obstinate defense...

57:05.760 --> 57:07.261
do you know what I did?

57:11.265 --> 57:14.301
I executed Vadandus,

57:14.435 --> 57:16.003
one of the nobles
I had captured,

57:16.137 --> 57:18.739
and I cut off
his fucking head.

57:20.474 --> 57:23.277
And then I took his head

57:24.478 --> 57:26.714
and I put it in
the ballista,

57:26.847 --> 57:28.548
and I sent it catapulting

57:28.682 --> 57:31.152
into the enemy's
fortifications.

57:32.653 --> 57:34.455
And they took it as a...

57:34.587 --> 57:35.689
a portent.

57:35.823 --> 57:37.625
They hastened to surrender.

57:43.464 --> 57:45.166
That's a true story.

57:46.801 --> 57:49.003
Would you have had
the wiles to act as I have?

57:53.007 --> 57:54.141
No.

57:54.275 --> 57:57.945
<i>Only a true soldier
has such an imagination.</i>

58:00.281 --> 58:01.581
Ah.

58:02.149 --> 58:03.284
You are awake.

58:07.855 --> 58:09.356
How long was I out?

58:10.124 --> 58:11.158
Almost a day.

58:11.292 --> 58:12.993
A day?

58:13.127 --> 58:14.695
I really must...

58:15.830 --> 58:18.365
Go. Yes.

58:22.570 --> 58:24.205
I heard a few mumblings.

58:24.338 --> 58:27.041
A name. Duria?

58:27.975 --> 58:30.444
Tell me,
from what do you run?

58:30.578 --> 58:31.579
Bandits?

58:31.712 --> 58:33.247
Other Romans, perhaps?

58:34.782 --> 58:36.817
Did you desert
your legion?

58:37.418 --> 58:38.586
I'm no deserter.

58:38.719 --> 58:40.855
I, too,
was a soldier of Rome.

58:42.723 --> 58:44.258
But that was
a long time ago.

58:46.093 --> 58:47.561
I have a mission
to complete.

58:47.695 --> 58:50.164
We each have
a mission to complete.

58:52.199 --> 58:53.400
Where are you headed,
soldier?

58:54.168 --> 58:55.970
To the Euphrates frontier.

58:57.071 --> 58:59.707
I carry a message
for General Corbulo.

59:01.275 --> 59:03.744
The lives of an entire
legion depend on my success.

59:03.878 --> 59:06.847
I see I am in the presence
of an uncommon man.

59:08.082 --> 59:09.583
Did you come across
the mountains

59:09.717 --> 59:11.152
from Paetus' encampment?

59:13.154 --> 59:14.255
Yes.

59:19.493 --> 59:21.262
And where did you serve Rome?

59:22.730 --> 59:25.232
In another life.

59:25.366 --> 59:26.767
A distant life.

59:28.836 --> 59:31.606
I served under
General Vespasian in Judea.

59:31.739 --> 59:33.941
- Vespasian?
- Mm-hmm.

59:34.808 --> 59:36.010
But, he was the only leader

59:36.143 --> 59:38.345
capable of putting down
the Jewish revolt

59:38.479 --> 59:39.780
against Nero.

59:40.649 --> 59:42.683
And his practice
of rewarding

59:42.816 --> 59:44.685
and releasing his oldest

59:44.818 --> 59:48.522
and most loyal
of soldiers is...

59:48.657 --> 59:50.057
well it's known by all.

59:50.758 --> 59:51.892
He's legendary, sir.

59:54.228 --> 59:55.829
I would have very much
liked to have served under

59:55.963 --> 59:56.997
such a great general.

59:57.131 --> 01:00:00.401
Now, I serve a great king.

01:00:01.569 --> 01:00:03.337
I do not understand.

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:04.673
Come.

01:00:04.805 --> 01:00:06.440
Drink and eat.

01:00:07.308 --> 01:00:09.176
You need to regain
your strength.

01:00:36.837 --> 01:00:38.906
I know this country well.

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.042
Your destination
is not far.

01:00:42.176 --> 01:00:44.979
The most direct route
is across a span of desert

01:00:45.112 --> 01:00:47.548
that lies between here
and the Euphrates River.

01:00:47.682 --> 01:00:49.850
I recommend staying out
of the sun,

01:00:49.984 --> 01:00:51.752
if you can,

01:00:51.885 --> 01:00:54.455
and stick to
the dry river gullies.

01:00:54.588 --> 01:00:57.726
Perhaps not the most direct
route across the desert, but...

01:00:57.891 --> 01:00:59.460
they will protect you.

01:00:59.593 --> 01:01:01.195
Sir, without knowing it,

01:01:01.328 --> 01:01:03.597
you've not only
saved my life,

01:01:03.732 --> 01:01:05.866
but the lives
of an entire legion.

01:01:06.635 --> 01:01:07.702
I am forever in your debt.

01:01:07.835 --> 01:01:09.036
Do not thank me.

01:01:09.169 --> 01:01:10.804
I would do this
for any man,

01:01:10.938 --> 01:01:13.340
Roman, Persian, Scythian.

01:01:13.474 --> 01:01:15.776
I'm glad I'm the only one
to hear you say this.

01:01:17.144 --> 01:01:20.147
It could be your death sentence
for betrayal against Rome.

01:01:21.048 --> 01:01:23.150
In the name of Rome,

01:01:23.917 --> 01:01:25.419
I killed many men.

01:01:27.187 --> 01:01:29.624
Now in my wildest
nightmares I recall

01:01:29.758 --> 01:01:33.762
how sometimes
I even enjoyed it.

01:01:33.894 --> 01:01:35.562
But I was the one
who died.

01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:37.766
Enemies?

01:01:37.898 --> 01:01:39.233
No.

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:40.801
Men.

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:43.470
In truth,
all of them equal.

01:01:43.605 --> 01:01:45.740
All of them
children of God.

01:01:45.873 --> 01:01:47.141
Equal?

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:51.445
And how, may I ask,

01:01:51.578 --> 01:01:54.915
did you return to life
after being dead?

01:01:55.049 --> 01:01:58.352
By listening to the words
of a crucified man.

01:01:58.485 --> 01:02:00.854
You should not speak
this way to anyone,

01:02:00.988 --> 01:02:02.823
least of all
a Roman soldier.

01:02:03.924 --> 01:02:05.526
Are you not aware
that Nero has sentenced

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.662
all Christians to death?

01:02:07.796 --> 01:02:09.830
I no longer fear anything.

01:02:09.963 --> 01:02:12.667
Not death.

01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:15.469
And, least of all, Nero.

01:02:15.603 --> 01:02:17.571
Without fear,

01:02:17.706 --> 01:02:19.173
we are free.

01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:23.944
Would you still be free
in a prison cell,

01:02:24.078 --> 01:02:26.046
condemned to the gallows,

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.449
or in the Coliseum
facing wild beasts?

01:02:28.582 --> 01:02:30.117
More free than ever.

01:02:31.318 --> 01:02:34.488
And you, do you not
want to be free?

01:02:34.622 --> 01:02:35.923
Well...

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:39.193
Well, as strange
as it may sound, sir...

01:02:41.095 --> 01:02:43.063
these last few days,

01:02:43.197 --> 01:02:45.933
I think I felt freedom
for the first time.

01:02:48.035 --> 01:02:50.404
Although I was pursued
by my enemies and...

01:02:51.773 --> 01:02:54.375
quickly chased down,
and they were ready to kill me,

01:02:56.243 --> 01:02:58.345
I've never felt so alive.

01:02:58.479 --> 01:03:01.515
I've really reveled in these last few
days, away from the army.

01:03:01.649 --> 01:03:04.619
Then it may be that one day
you will know real freedom,

01:03:04.753 --> 01:03:07.588
like me,
without killing.

01:03:08.623 --> 01:03:10.057
And perhaps someday,

01:03:11.091 --> 01:03:13.894
you will explain to me
this truth of yours,

01:03:14.027 --> 01:03:16.397
that makes all men equal,
and free.

01:03:18.633 --> 01:03:20.167
But for now I must go.

01:03:22.136 --> 01:03:24.238
I am very grateful
for your help.

01:03:25.472 --> 01:03:26.641
Saul.

01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:28.976
My name is Saul.

01:03:30.511 --> 01:03:31.646
I am Noreno.

01:03:41.955 --> 01:03:44.091
I packed
some provisions for you.

01:03:50.564 --> 01:03:52.299
You said that in life,

01:03:52.433 --> 01:03:54.368
we all have a mission
to complete.

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:57.705
Have you completed yours?

01:04:00.474 --> 01:04:02.142
No.

01:04:04.879 --> 01:04:06.280
Wait.

01:04:07.548 --> 01:04:09.249
Here.

01:04:09.383 --> 01:04:10.652
Take this.

01:04:17.124 --> 01:04:19.026
God go with you, soldier.

01:04:21.796 --> 01:04:23.997
You are a good man, Saul.

01:04:24.131 --> 01:04:26.066
I will not forget you.

01:10:43.978 --> 01:10:45.545
I dream that your...

01:10:46.781 --> 01:10:49.416
your precious fool
of a general,

01:10:49.549 --> 01:10:52.787
Paetus, is close
to surrender.

01:10:55.455 --> 01:10:56.958
His men are starving.

01:10:59.727 --> 01:11:02.462
His mercenaries
are deserting.

01:11:02.596 --> 01:11:04.364
The enemies of Rome

01:11:04.497 --> 01:11:06.566
have surrounded him

01:11:06.701 --> 01:11:10.137
and have cut off
his supply of lines.

01:11:10.905 --> 01:11:12.240
Emperor,

01:11:12.372 --> 01:11:14.909
had I led the legion
to reclaim Armenia,

01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:16.277
for Rome,

01:11:16.409 --> 01:11:18.613
we would've been
victorious by now.

01:11:22.549 --> 01:11:25.485
Why hasn't he sent
for me for help?

01:11:27.221 --> 01:11:28.455
Too proud?

01:11:30.825 --> 01:11:32.159
Too vain?

01:11:33.261 --> 01:11:35.062
Too stupid?

01:11:41.802 --> 01:11:43.570
Yet I hear nothing.

01:11:45.072 --> 01:11:46.807
I hear nothing.

01:11:46.941 --> 01:11:48.142
Do you, Emperor?

01:11:51.345 --> 01:11:52.847
Nothing.

01:11:54.115 --> 01:11:55.683
No galloping hooves.

01:11:56.684 --> 01:11:59.486
No... there's no insistent
footsteps.

01:12:00.721 --> 01:12:03.523
No one... no one has come.

01:12:05.259 --> 01:12:07.028
No one, no one to help,

01:12:07.161 --> 01:12:09.496
not a single damn messenger.

01:12:12.465 --> 01:12:14.669
You ordered me here to...

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:19.140
not to marshal my forces
unless Paetus himself

01:12:20.107 --> 01:12:22.944
sends word that I must
come to his aid.

01:12:26.747 --> 01:12:29.884
Three legions are at risk
of annihilation

01:12:31.886 --> 01:12:33.921
because of your poor judgment.

01:12:37.925 --> 01:12:42.196
And you've condemned your
most able general to wait.

01:12:43.331 --> 01:12:45.666
Well, I'm waiting.

01:13:11.325 --> 01:13:12.727
Not good enough.

01:13:42.923 --> 01:13:44.325
Get up!

01:14:05.545 --> 01:14:06.981
That's the spirit.

01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:11.218
Show me, Roman!

01:14:35.543 --> 01:14:36.677
You've done well,
better than anyone

01:14:36.811 --> 01:14:38.212
could've imagined.
But there comes a time

01:14:38.345 --> 01:14:41.515
between hunter and prey when
they both know it must end.

01:14:48.989 --> 01:14:50.791
You're better than this.

01:14:51.659 --> 01:14:53.327
Sand?

01:14:57.665 --> 01:14:59.100
I'm not done with you!

01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:01.001
Have my fun. Get up!

01:15:01.135 --> 01:15:03.070
You're gonna tell me
who taught you how to run.

01:15:20.821 --> 01:15:22.756
That's it!

01:15:22.890 --> 01:15:24.358
That's the fight
I'm looking for!

01:15:28.829 --> 01:15:31.732
We each have
a mission to complete.

01:15:51.018 --> 01:15:52.987
<i>Do you not want to be free?</i>

01:16:06.934 --> 01:16:08.135
Your mission is over.

01:16:08.269 --> 01:16:10.771
I will give you
the sweet release of death.

01:16:10.905 --> 01:16:13.340
Now tell me,
what is your name?

01:16:13.474 --> 01:16:16.243
I like to know the names of
things I'm going to kill.

01:16:32.661 --> 01:16:33.961
Do it!

01:16:34.728 --> 01:16:36.163
No.

01:16:36.297 --> 01:16:38.899
Your life
is meaningless to me.

01:16:40.301 --> 01:16:42.536
Now, you end
this macabre chase...

01:16:42.671 --> 01:16:45.039
or I swear,
it'll be your last!

01:17:38.792 --> 01:17:40.361
Permission to speak,
General.

01:17:47.401 --> 01:17:51.171
Well, what do we have today?
Is it urgent?

01:17:51.305 --> 01:17:54.341
Some of the patrolmen found a
legionnaire in the Euphrates.

01:17:54.475 --> 01:17:57.478
He claims to be
one of Paetus' men.

01:17:57.612 --> 01:17:59.146
Wow.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.482
Paetus.

01:18:01.616 --> 01:18:03.618
Well, he must be a deserter.

01:18:03.752 --> 01:18:05.853
It doesn't seem
to be the case.

01:18:05.986 --> 01:18:07.388
He says he's a messenger.

01:18:10.357 --> 01:18:12.960
Paetus dares
to send me a messenger?

01:18:14.561 --> 01:18:16.230
Where the fuck is he?

01:18:16.363 --> 01:18:17.965
Outside, waiting.

01:18:18.098 --> 01:18:19.967
He was armed only
with this.

01:18:21.435 --> 01:18:24.405
He insists that he alone
will hand you the message.

01:18:32.046 --> 01:18:33.547
Make him come in.

01:18:56.036 --> 01:18:57.639
What's your name, soldier?

01:18:58.572 --> 01:19:02.843
Legionnaire Quintus
Laberius Surus.

01:19:02.976 --> 01:19:04.713
Second cohort,

01:19:04.845 --> 01:19:06.547
fourth Scythia Legion, sir.

01:19:08.315 --> 01:19:10.719
I carry a message, sir...

01:19:10.851 --> 01:19:13.454
from General Paetus
to General Corbulo.

01:19:13.587 --> 01:19:16.256
So you're bringing me
a message from Paetus?

01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:17.324
Yes, sir.

01:19:34.676 --> 01:19:35.876
Oh, I'm sorry,

01:19:36.009 --> 01:19:38.011
but you've come here
for nothing.

01:19:38.145 --> 01:19:40.881
Valerius, see to it
that this man eats well,

01:19:41.014 --> 01:19:43.183
and reward his efforts.

01:19:43.317 --> 01:19:44.719
No, no, don't,
please, sir.

01:19:44.853 --> 01:19:46.086
You must help us.

01:19:48.055 --> 01:19:50.090
I'll not allow that tone,
soldier.

01:19:51.358 --> 01:19:53.862
That useless
fucking Paetus...

01:19:56.029 --> 01:19:58.165
the situation
is all his fault.

01:20:00.567 --> 01:20:03.137
Settling on such
a mountainous area

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:05.439
so goddamned
easy to attack.

01:20:05.572 --> 01:20:07.241
But sir,

01:20:07.374 --> 01:20:09.878
won't you do it
for the soldiers' sake?

01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:11.512
They have no fault
in the poor decisions

01:20:11.646 --> 01:20:14.014
- of their general.
- Who do you think you are,

01:20:14.749 --> 01:20:16.250
talking to me like that?

01:20:19.987 --> 01:20:21.388
You speak insolently.

01:20:25.693 --> 01:20:26.694
Yes...

01:20:28.663 --> 01:20:29.997
you're right.

01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:33.267
The general's bad decisions
are not the men's fault.

01:20:34.034 --> 01:20:36.103
That's what war is like.

01:20:36.236 --> 01:20:39.173
I'm not gonna help Paetus.

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.709
Valerius.

01:20:42.543 --> 01:20:44.044
- Come on.
- No.

01:20:46.213 --> 01:20:48.282
I'm sorry, soldier.

01:20:54.021 --> 01:20:55.289
Why won't he help us?

01:20:55.422 --> 01:20:57.424
Thousands of my men
will die.

01:21:15.309 --> 01:21:17.478
Oh, what is it, Amariah?

01:21:17.612 --> 01:21:18.880
What have I done now?

01:21:19.012 --> 01:21:21.048
I gather you've heard
my reply

01:21:21.181 --> 01:21:23.083
to the messenger,
didn't you?

01:21:23.217 --> 01:21:25.085
I have told you
that business of Rome...

01:21:25.219 --> 01:21:26.688
Is not my concern.

01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:30.157
Yes, you have.

01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:32.025
Especially as I am
your mistress,

01:21:32.159 --> 01:21:33.527
not your wife.

01:21:33.661 --> 01:21:36.196
Especially as
I'm not Roman-born.

01:21:37.431 --> 01:21:38.532
Amariah.

01:21:40.467 --> 01:21:43.170
Although
I was not born here,

01:21:43.303 --> 01:21:44.772
but this is my country.

01:21:44.906 --> 01:21:46.039
Your country,

01:21:46.173 --> 01:21:48.776
which is a claim
of the State of Rome.

01:21:50.077 --> 01:21:52.479
That should unite us,
not divide us.

01:21:55.182 --> 01:21:56.818
Well, all right,
it's true.

01:21:56.951 --> 01:21:58.987
I've refused
General Paetus'

01:21:59.119 --> 01:22:00.755
plea for help.

01:22:00.889 --> 01:22:02.657
And I've sent
his messenger back

01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:04.191
on his way, empty-handed.

01:22:04.324 --> 01:22:07.194
My orders from Emperor Nero
are clear.

01:22:07.327 --> 01:22:10.330
I'm to remain here on
the banks of the Euphrates

01:22:10.464 --> 01:22:14.468
to safeground the...
Syria on behalf of Rome.

01:22:14.602 --> 01:22:16.838
I do
not understand you, Gnaeus.

01:22:16.971 --> 01:22:20.340
For weeks you prowled the halls
of this palace at night...

01:22:20.474 --> 01:22:23.110
sleepless, agitated...

01:22:23.243 --> 01:22:26.547
awaiting General Paetus
to swallow his pride

01:22:26.681 --> 01:22:28.382
and ask for your help.

01:22:29.082 --> 01:22:30.885
No.

01:22:31.019 --> 01:22:32.519
Beg for your help.

01:22:33.353 --> 01:22:35.255
Then, when he finally does so?

01:22:37.424 --> 01:22:41.228
There's no glory in arriving
too late, Amariah.

01:22:47.936 --> 01:22:49.336
Oh.

01:22:56.778 --> 01:23:00.480
The young soldier boy,
he should be admired.

01:23:00.615 --> 01:23:03.183
I mean, look at the distance
that he traveled all alone,

01:23:03.317 --> 01:23:05.653
through no-man's-land,
wilderness,

01:23:05.787 --> 01:23:07.421
amuck with cutthroats

01:23:07.554 --> 01:23:10.090
and Parthian assassins...

01:23:10.223 --> 01:23:11.926
poor guy
went over mountains,

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:14.696
through forests,
across desert land.

01:23:16.463 --> 01:23:18.599
It's astonishing
that he managed

01:23:18.733 --> 01:23:20.001
to make it at all.

01:23:20.133 --> 01:23:22.003
- He was desperate.
- No.

01:23:22.135 --> 01:23:23.871
He's a soldier
in service to Rome.

01:23:24.005 --> 01:23:26.273
He fulfilled his duty.

01:23:26.406 --> 01:23:28.208
I have been
always impressed

01:23:28.342 --> 01:23:30.612
by the willpower
certain men exhibit

01:23:30.745 --> 01:23:33.213
when faced
with an impossible mission.

01:23:33.347 --> 01:23:36.450
Well, which is why history
will be remembered

01:23:36.583 --> 01:23:38.953
such as generals
as great men.

01:23:39.087 --> 01:23:40.287
Generals?

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:41.689
I'm talking about
simple soldiers

01:23:41.823 --> 01:23:43.992
like that messenger
who you dismissed

01:23:44.124 --> 01:23:45.660
without a second thought.

01:23:48.395 --> 01:23:49.831
He did his duty.

01:23:50.865 --> 01:23:52.232
You have told me many times

01:23:52.366 --> 01:23:55.103
of how you, above all
the other generals,

01:23:55.235 --> 01:23:56.638
particularly Paetus,

01:23:56.771 --> 01:23:59.339
appreciated the value
of good soldiers.

01:23:59.473 --> 01:24:02.342
And without them
and their stalwart strength,

01:24:02.476 --> 01:24:06.279
even the most...
best military commanders

01:24:06.413 --> 01:24:08.683
would have no chance
of victory.

01:24:12.219 --> 01:24:13.788
Are you saying

01:24:13.921 --> 01:24:15.857
I risk being forgotten
because I didn't come

01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:19.927
to the aid of a general
who's no better than a cur?

01:24:20.061 --> 01:24:21.561
No, my darling.

01:24:21.696 --> 01:24:24.699
Your place in history
is more than guaranteed

01:24:24.832 --> 01:24:28.636
in your celebrated single-handed
military victories.

01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:31.005
General Paetus
cannot fall further

01:24:31.139 --> 01:24:33.141
in esteem
than he already has.

01:24:33.273 --> 01:24:36.077
He's humiliated himself
in front of his men

01:24:36.209 --> 01:24:37.477
and, most importantly,

01:24:37.612 --> 01:24:39.914
in the eyes
of the Roman emperor.

01:24:40.982 --> 01:24:43.483
But, if he dies

01:24:43.618 --> 01:24:45.385
all alone in mountains
of Armenia...

01:24:45.519 --> 01:24:47.521
Then, good riddance.

01:24:47.655 --> 01:24:51.358
If he dies holed up
in the barren cold,

01:24:51.491 --> 01:24:53.161
under vicious attack,

01:24:53.293 --> 01:24:54.528
besieged,

01:24:54.662 --> 01:24:56.329
possibly fighting
for his life

01:24:56.463 --> 01:24:57.799
with his last breath...

01:24:57.932 --> 01:24:59.599
No. That's unlikely.

01:24:59.734 --> 01:25:01.736
There's always
the possibility

01:25:01.869 --> 01:25:03.938
he will become a martyr,

01:25:04.072 --> 01:25:06.040
even a posthumous hero.

01:25:06.174 --> 01:25:08.042
Paetus?

01:25:08.176 --> 01:25:10.210
- A hero?
- Yes.

01:25:10.343 --> 01:25:12.245
A martyr's hero,

01:25:12.379 --> 01:25:14.581
who gave his life for Rome.

01:25:16.349 --> 01:25:17.885
Legends, my love,

01:25:18.019 --> 01:25:19.252
do not necessarily rise

01:25:19.386 --> 01:25:21.488
from the facts of an event

01:25:21.622 --> 01:25:25.358
but from the most romanticized
version of a story...

01:25:25.492 --> 01:25:27.695
the story that people
most wanted to hear...

01:25:28.696 --> 01:25:31.431
the hero they wanted
to believe in.

01:25:33.034 --> 01:25:35.203
Oh, well,

01:25:35.335 --> 01:25:36.971
what would you have me do?

01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:59.861
Deny Paetus
his immortality.

01:26:01.896 --> 01:26:03.197
March to his aid.

01:26:03.330 --> 01:26:05.733
Do not grant him
a martyr's death.

01:26:08.169 --> 01:26:11.172
If Paetus returns
to Rome,

01:26:11.304 --> 01:26:14.307
he'll continue
his campaign to slander me.

01:26:14.441 --> 01:26:16.611
And the fucker
has the emperor's ear.

01:26:17.812 --> 01:26:20.181
Slander the man
who rescued him?

01:26:20.313 --> 01:26:22.216
- Uh-huh.
- His savior?

01:26:22.349 --> 01:26:23.450
The general
who liberated him

01:26:23.583 --> 01:26:25.987
from the jaws
of a certain death?

01:26:26.687 --> 01:26:28.321
No.

01:26:28.455 --> 01:26:31.291
Not even Paetus
is that stupid.

01:26:32.059 --> 01:26:33.393
And of me?

01:26:34.862 --> 01:26:37.799
What will be whispered
about me behind my back?

01:26:39.066 --> 01:26:40.968
They will say...

01:26:41.102 --> 01:26:42.804
"There goes...

01:26:42.937 --> 01:26:45.773
The great and honorable
General Corbulo,

01:26:45.907 --> 01:26:47.474
who was so moved

01:26:47.608 --> 01:26:50.077
by the courage
of a single soldier

01:26:50.211 --> 01:26:51.578
a messenger
who weathered

01:26:51.712 --> 01:26:53.281
an impossible journey

01:26:53.413 --> 01:26:55.482
to plead for help."

01:26:56.416 --> 01:26:58.619
My advice to you, General,

01:26:58.753 --> 01:27:01.956
is to praise this faithful
servant of Rome.

01:27:02.089 --> 01:27:03.891
Say nothing of Paetus.

01:27:04.025 --> 01:27:05.059
Instead...

01:27:07.128 --> 01:27:10.698
speak in complimentary terms
of unsung heroes.

01:27:10.832 --> 01:27:11.699
Do this.

01:27:11.833 --> 01:27:13.935
The legions will love you.

01:27:14.068 --> 01:27:16.536
No one will speak
a bad word against you.

01:27:17.672 --> 01:27:19.874
You have condemned
your political rival

01:27:20.007 --> 01:27:23.144
in a life sentence
of public gratitude

01:27:23.277 --> 01:27:25.545
of singing your praises

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:27.682
through clenched teeth.

01:27:31.484 --> 01:27:32.854
Are you sure

01:27:32.987 --> 01:27:35.555
you're not secretly
Roman-born, Amariah?

01:27:37.258 --> 01:27:39.660
You speak with the wisdom

01:27:39.794 --> 01:27:41.494
of one with intimate knowledge

01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:45.365
of this political
machinations of the capital.

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.537
Politics are the same
everywhere

01:27:50.671 --> 01:27:53.373
as is the quest for power,

01:27:53.506 --> 01:27:56.143
internal and universal.

01:27:56.277 --> 01:27:59.847
The only thing
that ever changes

01:27:59.981 --> 01:28:03.483
is the names of those
who wield the scepter

01:28:03.618 --> 01:28:05.119
or the sword.

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.454
Go.

01:28:09.056 --> 01:28:09.991
Go.

01:28:14.561 --> 01:28:15.763
Valerius!

01:28:17.999 --> 01:28:19.800
Summon the tribunes!

01:28:19.934 --> 01:28:21.769
I want to see them immediately.

01:28:21.903 --> 01:28:25.139
The troops must be ready
to march at dawn.

01:28:42.422 --> 01:28:44.191
Congratulations, soldier.

01:28:45.458 --> 01:28:47.962
Do you know
what you're going to do now?

01:28:48.095 --> 01:28:51.265
Well, I'm going to return
to Armenia.

01:28:51.399 --> 01:28:53.533
You're gonna go back?

01:28:54.434 --> 01:28:56.503
But your mission
was a success.

01:28:57.004 --> 01:28:58.205
Yes.

01:28:58.339 --> 01:29:00.274
But when I was
on my way here,

01:29:00.408 --> 01:29:02.376
I met a man,

01:29:02.509 --> 01:29:05.512
and he said to me
that in life

01:29:05.646 --> 01:29:07.982
we all have a mission
that needs to be fulfilled.

01:29:09.183 --> 01:29:11.518
And I feel like I still
haven't fulfilled mine.

01:29:12.787 --> 01:29:16.190
And I'd like to think
that maybe...

01:29:16.324 --> 01:29:17.625
somewhere out there,

01:29:17.758 --> 01:29:19.694
there's a woman
waiting for me.

01:29:21.996 --> 01:29:23.998
And I can live a life
in peace.

01:29:25.166 --> 01:29:26.701
Well...

01:29:26.834 --> 01:29:29.737
may the gods help you
in your new life, soldier.
