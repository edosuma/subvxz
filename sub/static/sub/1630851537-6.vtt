WEBVTT

00:11.428 --> 00:13.805
All right, Nabila, shred that core.

00:14.597 --> 00:17.267
Oh, God, Claire's here.
Pretend you're working out.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.435
I am working out.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.314
-Oh, hey, Grant.
-Hey, Grant.

00:23.398 --> 00:26.985
-I mean, I'm Grant.
-Yeah, totally.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.403
I'm good. How are you?

00:28.486 --> 00:30.488
Oh, I'm good.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.116
-That's good to be good.
-Yeah.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.202
I'm gonna head out. I'll see you at home.

00:36.286 --> 00:40.373
-Not if I don't see you first.
-Yeah, totally. I'll see you later.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.499
Later, dude.

00:41.583 --> 00:45.086
I mean, skater dude. I mean, skater girl.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.797
I said, "See you later, girl."

00:50.425 --> 00:51.259
Okay.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.139
You hot people are so weird.

01:07.692 --> 01:11.237
And then he said, "See you, skater girl."

01:11.321 --> 01:12.864
It was so awkward.

01:12.947 --> 01:16.076
Avril Lavigne. That is awkward.

01:18.119 --> 01:22.082
Grant basically professed
his love for you, and you turned him down.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.876
-Weirdness is to be expected.
-Yeah, I know.

01:24.959 --> 01:28.046
Claire, I'm gonna ask you point-blank.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.840
Do you have feelings for Grant
like he does for you?

01:32.842 --> 01:33.676
Really?

01:35.678 --> 01:36.513
No.

01:37.388 --> 01:41.434
I mean, I did,
I have, but I don't anymore.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.019
I feel bad that I hurt his feelings,

01:43.103 --> 01:45.355
and I want things to go back
to the way they were.

01:45.438 --> 01:50.777
Grant will be okay. I'm sure he's in pain,
but he'll move on, really. He will.

01:50.860 --> 01:54.030
Okay. Good. That's good.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.909
Enough about me and Grant.
What about you? Talk to me.

01:57.992 --> 01:58.910
Tell me everything.

01:58.993 --> 02:02.914
Okay. Well, I do have something
that's very Tropicana.

02:04.707 --> 02:07.043
-It's juicy.
-What?

02:07.127 --> 02:10.755
So I was watching
this old-timey movie called Ghost,

02:10.839 --> 02:13.800
and this scene that's very slay
where Demi Moore is mushing clay,

02:13.883 --> 02:16.553
and her hot, shirtless,
Patrick Swayze husband

02:16.636 --> 02:19.264
is all, "Let me get behind you
and help you sculpt."

02:20.348 --> 02:24.561
And at first you're like, "Mud? Gross."
But then, it gets so sexy

02:24.644 --> 02:28.982
when their wet gooey fingers start
intertwining in sludgy, sinful ecstasy.

02:29.065 --> 02:29.899
Wow.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.861
So this got me looking online
for a pottery twunk.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.405
See if I can get my hands
on a muddy hand partner.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.073
-And?
-I found one.

02:38.408 --> 02:42.787
He's so stun, and he teaches
a pottery class nearby. Check him out.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.208
Hello, @ShouldIClayOrShouldIThrow!

02:47.292 --> 02:51.087
There's just one problem.
I can't tell if he's straight or gay.

02:51.171 --> 02:56.593
-Or pan, or bi, or questioning, or...
-Thank you, GLAAD Committee Co-chair.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.138
I appreciate your allyship,
blah, blah, blah,

03:00.221 --> 03:02.182
now help me figure out
if this guy likes D.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.354
Oh, my God, what is that? It smells awful.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.939
I know, right?

03:11.024 --> 03:14.402
It's durian fruit.
Terrible odor but powerfully cleansing.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.446
It's like a super-duper food.

03:16.529 --> 03:20.575
Yes, the classic food pyramid.
Grains, vegetables, and super-dupers.

03:22.243 --> 03:26.456
Solana, you'll be proud of me.
I took your advice about dating again.

03:26.539 --> 03:30.043
Unless you're banging a guy from Staples,
I'm not sure how this is relevant.

03:31.127 --> 03:35.173
This is the research I'm doing
before I decide who I'm going to date.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.176
There's 1.8 million men in Los Angeles,

03:38.259 --> 03:41.679
and 500,000 of them are
within reasonable geographic range,

03:41.763 --> 03:43.806
I cross-referenced that
with a college degree,

03:43.890 --> 03:45.558
and then I removed about 15%

03:45.642 --> 03:48.603
to account for the L.A. epidemic
of thin chin hair.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.317
You're procrastinating.
This will speed things along.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.361
I signed you up for a dating app.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.113
What? How?

04:00.156 --> 04:02.408
When did you take this picture?
I look amazing.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.454
Just go on a date, now.

04:06.537 --> 04:10.333
-All right, fine, I will.
-I don't believe you. Pinkie swear.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.212
-Solana, we're both adults.
-It wasn't a request.

04:17.882 --> 04:22.053
May you be cursed by tiny-fingered gods
if you break your pinkie oath.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.264
I'm so excited for you!

04:29.352 --> 04:32.814
Michael, the way men behave
on dating apps is abhorrent.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.232
I get it.

04:34.315 --> 04:37.485
I thought I found the girl of my dreams,
but it was Burger King

04:37.568 --> 04:39.821
catfishing me to promote
a new chicken sandwich.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.491
Dating in L.A. is brutal.

04:44.867 --> 04:45.827
Sup?

04:47.203 --> 04:49.706
Wow. That might be the saddest
"sup" I've ever heard.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.582
Claire was here.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.792
I was so awkward,

04:52.875 --> 04:55.295
the security guys
have been rewatching the footage.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.338
Oh, yeah. I saw.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.424
Avril Lavigne, huh?

05:01.509 --> 05:02.885
Grant, I feel terrible.

05:02.969 --> 05:06.139
I told you to go for it,
and I totally misread how she was feeling.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.056
I'm sorry.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.518
You have nothing to be sorry about.
I asked you for help.

05:10.601 --> 05:14.230
And it's good that I know
where she stands. I don't regret it.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.025
-I don't wanna feel hurt anymore.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.443
Oh.

05:18.526 --> 05:21.029
-What's wrong?
-I'm on a dating app.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.906
I got a message from the defendant
at my future murder trial.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.119
Solana signed me up.

05:28.202 --> 05:32.623
She made me pinkie promise to date,
and I'm oddly afraid to break it.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.710
Good for you, Chelsea. That takes courage.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.589
You know, maybe it's time
I put myself out there too.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.965
Move on from Claire.

05:41.758 --> 05:45.678
Yeah, that's a great idea,
but I've gotta warn you, it's not easy.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.222
-Dating in L.A. is--
-I'd like to go on a date.

05:53.770 --> 05:54.771
--brutal.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.397
Hey.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.358
Hi.

06:00.443 --> 06:03.446
-Look at this one. Is he gay or straight?
-Huh.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.239
Shirtless overalls.

06:05.323 --> 06:09.243
On the one hand, very Boho,
on the other, kind of homo.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.704
None of these are helping.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.956
A selfie with a strip of paint
on his face.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.833
A foot holding a vegetable peeler.

06:15.917 --> 06:19.504
A happy birthday message to Sasha Obama.
Who is this man?

06:20.546 --> 06:22.382
I fell in love with a sculptor once.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.384
We're talking about me, Howard.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.140
What am I gonna do?
About Howard interrupting.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.059
I don't know.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.436
But I have an idea for pottery guy.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.190
We should go and take a class.
Gaydar works better in person.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.567
That's a great idea.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.070
We both represent
the peak specimens of our gender,

06:44.153 --> 06:47.240
so "Should I Clay or Should I
Throw" will flirt with one of us.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.157
I'll be gay bait--

06:48.241 --> 06:50.785
-And I'll be straight bait!
-Then we'll find out if he's gay.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.079
Or asexual, or greysexual,
or demisexual...

06:53.162 --> 06:56.207
I'm so happy that you read the pamphlet.

06:56.290 --> 06:59.585
But you've gotta focus. Okay?
We've gotta change.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.922
-For this, we must look our sexiest.
-Yay, pottery!

07:03.005 --> 07:05.133
Oh, this is so much fun!

07:05.967 --> 07:07.802
I love trying new things.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.637
Oh, I hope he's gay for you.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.890
And I hope you make something out of clay.

07:17.812 --> 07:22.400
That's why I stop drinking water
at least two hours before going to movies.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.860
You're so funny.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.612
So dinner tonight?

07:26.696 --> 07:30.950
Sounds great. Uh, but just to ask,
would you be down for a double date?

07:31.033 --> 07:33.202
I have a single brother
if you know anyone.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.621
Actually, I know the perfect person.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.207
-Chelsea.
-Uh-huh?

07:38.291 --> 07:41.836
Would you wanna go on a double date
with me and Karen and Karen's brother?

07:42.670 --> 07:43.504
Oh.

07:44.046 --> 07:46.674
Thank you, but I have
something in the works.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.926
I'm talking to this guy that seems great.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.846
No creepy pics, hasn't asked
for a wire transfer,

07:51.929 --> 07:54.182
and he knows when
to use "it's" with an apostrophe

07:54.265 --> 07:56.934
and it's, with an apostrophe, refreshing.

07:58.102 --> 08:02.273
I've really got a good one here.
Okay, and he just sent me a dick-pic.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.903
Two, actually.
And there's the third musketeer.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.992
Oh, and if you zoom in, you can see
Tucker Carlson playing in the background.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.661
Which, if you think about it,
is the fourth dick-pic.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.581
Double date it is.

08:21.876 --> 08:22.710
Hello?

08:24.045 --> 08:25.838
Claire? Grant?

08:27.006 --> 08:29.550
Chelsea? Jayden?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.512
Justin Trudeau's nudes leaked!

08:36.516 --> 08:37.558
Ooh!

08:40.561 --> 08:42.480
Alone at last.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.151
Ooh.

08:47.735 --> 08:51.614
It's like mother nature
vomited in her mouth. Yum.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.663
Welcome to Chewing Mindfully.

08:58.746 --> 09:02.917
Why just eat out
when you can eat from the inside out?

09:08.881 --> 09:09.715
Why?

09:10.591 --> 09:12.635
Why is there a mouse here?

09:15.054 --> 09:15.888
No.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.349
No, Solana!

09:21.310 --> 09:24.397
It's just a mouse,
and mice are people too.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.243
Even this room's sexuality is unclear.

09:39.870 --> 09:43.916
-Who is she?
-We're trying to get the guy's attention.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.420
You're straight bait,
not conversion therapy.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.966
Welcome, everyone. I'm Topher.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.513
It really could go either way.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.058
Take a seat at your wheels.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.561
-Exciting, right?
-Very.

10:05.146 --> 10:09.066
This introduction to ceramics session
is all about having fun

10:09.150 --> 10:12.320
and embracing that inner sense of play
we all have within us.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.572
'Cause, baby, you were born this clay.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.909
Looking pretty good so far.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.122
Let the straight or gay-mes begin.

10:25.333 --> 10:29.545
Actually, I have two dogs,
Mariah and Joe Montana.

10:32.173 --> 10:37.678
So, anyway, I am obsessed with Britney
and Christina, my two favorite nieces.

10:39.764 --> 10:44.185
So there I was, on my knees,
loving every second of it.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.314
Changing a tire is so rewarding.

10:51.817 --> 10:55.529
I have no idea. Dating in L.A. is brutal.

11:01.118 --> 11:04.372
God, I don't wanna do this.
I mean, a blind date?

11:04.455 --> 11:06.999
What if he's a bones collector
or something?

11:07.083 --> 11:10.378
I can't be looking for my bra
and step on a ferret clavicle.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.005
Relax, you're just nervous.

11:13.089 --> 11:16.008
Karen is awesome, and she says
her brother is even awesomer.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.969
You'll see how normal it is
once we sit down and order drinks.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.640
Yes. Alcohol makes the smart voices
go away.

11:24.725 --> 11:25.559
Hey!

11:25.643 --> 11:26.894
-Hey!
-Hi!

11:26.977 --> 11:27.812
Hi.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.106
-Hey, Grant.
-Nice to meet you. Aaron.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.190
Chelsea.

11:31.273 --> 11:33.359
I have to admit, I'm relieved.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.487
When my sister was setting me up
with a girl from the gym, well,

11:37.113 --> 11:38.364
you can imagine my worry.

11:38.447 --> 11:42.451
Oh, you were afraid I might be strong
enough to suffocate you with my thighs?

11:48.708 --> 11:51.377
No, not... Not that. Whoo!

11:52.545 --> 11:55.631
It's just that blind dates
as a concept are insane.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.301
Insane. Yes, exactly.
It's like, you could be anyone!

11:59.385 --> 12:01.887
Something tells me
we both dodged a bullet this time.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.056
Yes, it seems that way.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.225
Hey, guys, what can I get you?

12:06.308 --> 12:10.521
Reminder, there's no buddies discount.
Claire just made that up.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.233
Okay. Hi, Howard, I'll just have
a vodka soda. Thanks.

12:14.316 --> 12:15.818
Tequila soda for me, please.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.279
Sure, and for you two?

12:18.863 --> 12:21.574
My sister and I will each
have a gin and tonic.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.659
In one glass, with two straws.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.456
Sorry, I may have misheard.
You each want a gin and tonic?

12:28.539 --> 12:29.707
-Yes.
-Got it.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.876
-In one glass.
-With two straws.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.464
And he doesn't like citrus, so if you can
please put the lime on my side.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.175
Okay.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.805
You know, I think he may have
thought you wanted to share one drink,

12:44.889 --> 12:47.057
which you don't, right?

12:47.141 --> 12:49.477
No, that's exactly what we want.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.403
I understand that you're an exterminator,

12:59.487 --> 13:02.740
and that it rhymes
with terminator for a reason.

13:02.823 --> 13:07.536
But do you offer any solutions
that don't end in violence or death?

13:08.996 --> 13:11.332
I don't know. Rodent hypnosis.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.459
Tiny talk therapy.

13:14.502 --> 13:18.506
Dr. Drew-style intervention
but without the exploitation.

13:20.257 --> 13:25.387
Oh, I sound crazy because I'm talking
about mice like they're people.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.265
You know what?

13:29.058 --> 13:32.353
I am one with nature,
so I will get rid of this mouse myself,

13:32.436 --> 13:37.233
and it will be a spiritual, ethical,
and beautiful experience for all!

13:41.570 --> 13:43.322
Oh, no.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.870
Oh, that looks awesome.
Have you done pottery before?

13:49.954 --> 13:51.914
No, but I've dabbled in Play-Doh.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.918
Oh, yeah, my mom would buy me
those six-packs. I would go to town.

13:56.001 --> 13:59.129
That's so sweet of your mom.
I buy my own supply.

14:01.298 --> 14:04.134
-I'm Dave, by the way.
-I'm Claire.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.389
-So how did you end up here?
-Oh, I'm just helping my friend.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.892
He wants to get Ghosted-up
by the instructor. What about you?

14:11.976 --> 14:14.562
Well, actually,
I won this class in a work raffle.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.273
I was pulling for the Nespresso,
but this is good too.

14:17.356 --> 14:21.402
-I like trying new things.
-I like trying new things.

14:21.485 --> 14:25.781
You should do work raffles. Last month,
I won the boss' parking spot for a day.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.993
It was a Saturday, so it was a trick
to get me to work on the weekend,

14:29.076 --> 14:30.870
but boy, it was pretty fun!

14:35.541 --> 14:37.668
Hey, we're here for a reason.

14:39.795 --> 14:40.629
Teacher!

14:42.172 --> 14:43.007
She needs help.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.427
-Jayden!
-Just flirt with him.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.512
-What should I say?
-Ask a lot of questions.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.806
If he's straight, he will be mansplaining.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.769
-You were doing so well. What happened?
-Uh...

14:56.520 --> 14:58.981
What do you think happened?

15:00.274 --> 15:02.651
Um, it seems like your piece fell over.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.905
-Did it though?
-It definitely did.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.990
Can you help me fix it?

15:09.742 --> 15:10.784
Not a problem.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.162
All right.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.499
First, you smack it down.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.880
-Then, you get it wet.
-Oh.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.590
Then, you keep a steady pump.

15:26.508 --> 15:30.179
Now, I'll grab the base, and you can
use your hands to make it grow.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.764
No, I can't.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.355
Oh, no!

15:39.980 --> 15:42.107
I don't wanna get clay in my hair.

15:43.150 --> 15:47.738
I mean, do I wanna get clay in my hair?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.074
Definitely not.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.535
But if you do, just do
a sea salt scrub for your scalp

15:53.619 --> 15:55.788
followed by a marula oil hair mask.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.458
Houston, we have a homo.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.755
They stopped letting us
do co-ed wrestling in middle school,

16:04.838 --> 16:07.341
and that's when we became
ballroom dancing partners.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.635
Oh, you're dancers.

16:10.260 --> 16:14.932
That explains why you've been talking
so much about each other's feet, I think.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.019
Our specialty is the tango.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.607
When we hear a tango,
we just have to dance.

16:23.691 --> 16:28.737
You know, this isn't a tango.
I think it's Huey Lewis and the News.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.657
It's like there's a magnet on each of us.

16:32.324 --> 16:35.160
-And we're pulled into one another.
-Attached.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.620
One beat.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.663
One heart.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.041
Clap so it's over. Clap so it's over.

16:43.043 --> 16:47.548
Wow. You guys have so much chemistry.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.592
So, uh...

16:50.676 --> 16:53.762
-Oh! Something different to talk about.
-Good.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.181
This is my first ever double date.
What about you?

16:56.265 --> 16:57.599
We exclusively double date.

16:57.683 --> 16:58.684
Of course.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.687
-I can see how that might sound weird.
-No.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.981
Only because
we wanna have kids at the same time.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.899
-Waiter!
-It makes more sense

17:05.983 --> 17:08.777
for us to meet people
at the exact same time,

17:08.861 --> 17:12.906
move them into our home,
and start building a life together.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.077
I'm sorry, I'm feeling a bit faint.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.663
-You should sit down.
-I don't wanna sit down!

17:22.082 --> 17:26.170
I have to go to the bathroom.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.756
Oh, I have to help her go to the bathroom.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.716
Understood.

17:33.677 --> 17:37.222
These people are insane.
We're in the Seventh Circle of Hell.

17:37.306 --> 17:41.435
Usually, I try to see the best in people.
But I can't see any best. There's no best!

17:41.518 --> 17:42.436
Let's go.

17:42.519 --> 17:46.315
Wait. My leftovers. All that protein.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.194
We'll raid a chicken farm
on the way home. Let's go!

17:55.741 --> 17:58.243
Teacher, Topher babes.

17:59.703 --> 18:03.540
Just struggling with the height.
If I could get help, that would be incred.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.125
Of course.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.130
I couldn't help but notice
how well you work the clay.

18:10.714 --> 18:13.884
I don't like to brag,
but I'm pretty good with my hands.

18:14.468 --> 18:18.222
That's good.
Because I'm a hands-on learner.

18:19.348 --> 18:22.976
A hands-on-hands learner.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.816
Whatever I can do to help you learn.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.075
It's happening.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.786
It's a full-on Ghost.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.550
Okay, little guy.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.469
Go through the tubes!

19:00.389 --> 19:03.934
I realize now this looks
like a trap designed to kill you.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.853
That's my bad.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.440
I promise you, it's not.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.569
Yes, yes, yes! Yes, go!

19:14.444 --> 19:15.654
Go on. No!

19:15.737 --> 19:18.198
In here. In here!

19:19.199 --> 19:20.826
Oh, why?

19:22.119 --> 19:24.288
Why won't you go?

19:24.830 --> 19:27.124
What do you want from me?

19:28.542 --> 19:32.087
All I wanted was a night alone
with my meditation app

19:32.171 --> 19:35.674
and my durian fruit
that smells like sewer wine!

19:38.260 --> 19:39.219
That's it!

19:39.928 --> 19:44.600
That's why you're here!
You love the stinky fruit.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.351
Yes, hey.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.145
Hey. Go.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.271
Go, go, go.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.232
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Go.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.234
Go, go, go.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.447
I did it!

20:00.824 --> 20:06.079
I am one with nature. Unh, unh, yes!

20:07.539 --> 20:09.374
Way to make a move, Jayden.

20:09.458 --> 20:14.463
What can I say?
I gave him Demi, and he gave me more.

20:17.549 --> 20:21.053
I got his number too.
I think love is in the air tonight.

20:21.136 --> 20:24.973
I got a text from Grant saying he just
went on his first date in, like, forever.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.059
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.062
How are you feeling about that?

20:31.396 --> 20:32.231
Well...

20:34.900 --> 20:36.109
Relieved, actually.

20:37.736 --> 20:38.779
We're both moving on.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.616
I'll be right back.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.121
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

20:48.205 --> 20:51.541
Oh, nice cup / mug / bowl.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.629
-I always thought they could be one thing.
-Thanks.

20:56.255 --> 21:00.759
So I was thinking. You like doing
new things and I like doing new things.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.679
Maybe we could do
a new thing together some time?

21:04.429 --> 21:07.557
Yeah, I would absolutely love to.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.645
What should we do? Oh!
There's another work raffle coming up.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.772
I'll buy a thousand tickets.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.443
-Or you could just take me to dinner.
-Right.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.195
Yeah, that's a safer bet.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.865
Great. It's a date.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.451
Great.

21:30.747 --> 21:31.873
The tango...

21:33.834 --> 21:36.628
is not only a beautiful dance

21:36.712 --> 21:39.089
but a convenient way
to dry hump your sibling.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.509
Your face when they said
they went to prom as a couple.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.762
And your face when they demonstrated
how they prefer to be held.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.558
I can't wrap my head
around what we went through.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.436
Maybe the worst date
in the history of dating.

21:52.519 --> 21:53.520
Mm-hm.

21:56.815 --> 22:01.153
But honestly, I don't remember
the last time I had this much fun.

22:01.236 --> 22:02.738
Yeah, me neither.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.907
I feel like myself again. Better even.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.078
-Thank you, Chelsea.
-Hey, I didn't do anything.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.706
Well, I couldn't have done it without you.

22:15.792 --> 22:18.128
We did it. We went on a date.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.965
And I sweat through my dress
in the first five minutes.

22:22.632 --> 22:23.633
Yeah, you did.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.387
Ugh.

22:29.181 --> 22:33.143
-Well, I should probably get to bed.
-Yeah. Same.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.360
Well, this is me.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.403
Oh, this is you.

22:46.239 --> 22:49.159
-I live right next door.
-Oh, small world.

22:50.285 --> 22:51.536
Goodnight, Grant.

22:55.248 --> 22:56.458
Goodnight, Chelsea.
