JOHN POWELL:
You can't understand
the United States history

01:44.863 --> 01:47.590
without understanding
the role that slavery played.

01:48.315 --> 01:50.662
It was already
a very formal institution

01:50.696 --> 01:53.078
by the time United States
became a nation.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.011
It actually defined the nation.

01:56.185 --> 01:59.049
IAN HANEY LOPEZ:
Slavery didn't
just end and go away.

01:59.567 --> 02:03.675
We as a country were formed out
of a compromise with slavery.

02:03.951 --> 02:07.299
The southern colonies were not
willing to be part of a union,

02:07.334 --> 02:09.681
part of a national government

02:09.715 --> 02:12.270
unless the institution
of slavery was protected

02:12.304 --> 02:14.444
and the price of protecting
that institution

02:14.479 --> 02:18.034
was disproportionate power
to the South politically

02:18.068 --> 02:20.381
and it carries through today.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.524
JODY ALLEN:
We possibly could have lightened
some of the consequences

02:25.559 --> 02:31.772
of slavery if there had not
been such a concerted effort

02:31.806 --> 02:36.984
to maintain the differences
between blacks and whites.

02:37.433 --> 02:40.953
It's kind of like an infection,
I think. It may go away

02:40.988 --> 02:44.578
but it always bubbles back
up to the top eventually.

02:45.026 --> 02:46.925
I think that's
what's happening now.

03:21.270 --> 03:24.859
He's chilling motive, one source tells CNN that the 21 year-old

03:24.894 --> 03:26.792

FRANCES CAUSEY: God, nothing ever changes here.

03:30.382 --> 03:33.765
Why does this keep
happening over and over again?

03:36.008 --> 03:40.323
I was born in Greensboro,
North Carolina in 1963

03:40.358 --> 03:43.153
into a world where
white superiority

03:43.188 --> 03:44.879
was rarely questioned.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.919
As a child, the only black
people I ever interacted with

03:49.953 --> 03:53.578
in a meaningful way were
the people who worked for us.

03:54.095 --> 03:56.305
I loved them like family.

03:57.167 --> 04:00.101
I felt a huge amount of sadness as a kid

04:00.136 --> 04:03.035
seeing how they
and other African-Americans

04:03.070 --> 04:04.968
were treated in the South.

04:05.417 --> 04:07.247
I didn't understand it.

04:07.695 --> 04:10.629
I knew something
was deeply wrong

04:10.664 --> 04:12.873
but it was not okay
to talk about it.

04:14.219 --> 04:18.637
My longtime friend and producing partner, Sally Holst and I

04:18.672 --> 04:20.777
shared a similar upbringing.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.332
SALLY HOLST:
You know, I felt it.

04:23.504 --> 04:27.715
It was confusion.
It was crazy-making and anger.

04:29.130 --> 04:33.549
CAUSEY: Like Sally, the sorrow,
anger and lingering questions

04:33.583 --> 04:36.586
about the racist South
of my childhood

04:36.621 --> 04:39.175
shadowed me into adulthood.

04:39.762 --> 04:44.076
I never understood how much
my own uncomfortable journey

04:44.111 --> 04:45.492
to talk about this

04:45.526 --> 04:49.358
was connected to an untold
history of our nation.

04:54.052 --> 04:59.229
It's hard to be black in a world controlled by white folks.

05:00.023 --> 05:03.095
Du Bois said, we always
have the double consciousness.

05:03.579 --> 05:06.444
We're trying to be black and meanwhile, you got a white ghost

05:06.478 --> 05:08.238
hovering over your head
that says,

05:08.273 --> 05:10.171
"If you don't do this,
you'll get killed.

05:10.206 --> 05:12.035
If you don't do this,
you won't get no money.

05:12.070 --> 05:14.348
If you don't do this, nobody
would think you're beautiful.

05:14.383 --> 05:16.833
If you don't do this, nobody
would think you're smart."

CAUSEY: The transatlantic
slave trade took off

05:46.829 --> 05:51.178
in the early 18th century
and produced huge profits.

05:51.661 --> 05:54.768

06:00.152 --> 06:01.775
GERALD HORNE: One of the reasons
why the United States

06:01.809 --> 06:03.224
is such an advanced country

06:03.259 --> 06:07.159
is because of not only slavery
but the slave trade.

06:07.712 --> 06:10.577
We know that slavery
was financed from places

06:10.611 --> 06:14.546
like New York, Rhode Island,
Newport and Boston.

06:15.754 --> 06:19.206
CAUSEY:
One of the reasons Wall Street
was created in the first place

06:19.240 --> 06:21.415
was to finance
the slave industry.

06:21.657 --> 06:25.108
Everything from buying slaves
to even mortgaging them.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.285
HORNE: What you see is not only
the building of more ships

06:29.319 --> 06:31.183
which employs workers.

06:31.218 --> 06:33.841
You're seeing the building
of insurance companies

06:33.876 --> 06:35.843
because Africans are revolting

06:35.878 --> 06:38.225
and you need to have
insurance policies.

06:39.088 --> 06:41.918
You see the construction
of banking

06:41.953 --> 06:45.439
because these voyages
have to be financed

06:45.474 --> 06:50.340
and therein, you begin
to see the seeds, the kernels

06:50.375 --> 06:53.585
of an advanced economic system

06:53.620 --> 06:58.556
and the rise of capitalism is
clearly on the backs of slavery

06:58.590 --> 07:00.178
and the enslaved Africans.

07:00.937 --> 07:04.527
[♪♪♪]

07:12.570 --> 07:16.056
CAUSEY: It was astonishing to me that many of the first Africans

07:16.090 --> 07:20.578
in the American colonies weren't slaves but indentured servants.

07:20.854 --> 07:23.028
For a while,
poor blacks and whites

07:23.063 --> 07:24.927
worked alongside each other.

07:25.721 --> 07:28.517
POWELL:
The connection between
Europeans and Africans

07:28.551 --> 07:30.173
was actually quite robust.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.106
A lot of marriages
formally and informally.

07:32.141 --> 07:34.246
A lot of children
formally and informally.

07:34.281 --> 07:36.835
Probably much greater
integration

07:36.870 --> 07:39.148
between people of African
descent and European descent

07:39.182 --> 07:40.529
than we have today.

07:42.392 --> 07:45.672
CAUSEY:
Indentured whites and blacks
worked for their masters

07:45.706 --> 07:47.501
for five to seven years.

07:48.744 --> 07:51.436
Africans went from
indentured servitude

07:51.471 --> 07:53.714
to enslavement gradually.

07:54.128 --> 07:58.339
One colony, one person
and one law at a time.

08:00.652 --> 08:02.136
PAUL KIVEL: It started with
the dispossession

08:02.171 --> 08:04.173
of Native Americans.
So to the concept that

08:04.207 --> 08:07.590
they didn't actually have title
to the land or deserve the land

08:07.625 --> 08:09.419
because they weren't Christians.

08:09.523 --> 08:14.666
So all of U.S. law around land
and the accumulation of land

08:14.701 --> 08:18.567
by the English and French and
Spanish was based upon that.

08:19.153 --> 08:22.467
Europeans felt completely
comfortable going into Africa

08:22.502 --> 08:26.989
and enslaving people who are
also heathens, non-Christians

08:27.023 --> 08:30.406
and bringing them to the
new world, to South and Central

08:30.440 --> 08:34.514
and North America and so
slavery was justified by this.

08:34.755 --> 08:38.828
It allowed the conquerors
to feel righteous that

08:38.863 --> 08:42.522
they were in fact doing favors
to whoever they encountered.

08:43.107 --> 08:46.940
It was all redefined as
a benevolent process.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.808
POWELL: To most people's mind,
America means white.

08:53.015 --> 08:56.915
The country was founded by
two groups, Anglos and Saxons,

08:56.950 --> 08:59.746
Christian protestant,
English-speaking.

08:59.884 --> 09:02.438
So all these things
get bound up together.

09:03.508 --> 09:07.270
KIVEL: Just being Christian
was not distinction enough

09:07.305 --> 09:10.964
to separate who was entitled
to civil rights

09:10.998 --> 09:13.035
and respect and resources.

09:13.345 --> 09:18.696
So Christianity became
divided into white Christians --

09:18.730 --> 09:21.906
really, white male Christians --
then everybody else.

09:22.147 --> 09:23.632
There was a racial supremacy

09:23.666 --> 09:25.806
and a religious supremacy
intertwined.

09:26.255 --> 09:28.498
[bell tolls]

09:30.880 --> 09:35.540
CAUSEY:
Yet 1,000 black and white
Virginians rose up together

09:35.575 --> 09:39.717
in rebellion against
rich planters in 1676.

09:40.062 --> 09:44.204
The rebels wanted more wealth
and power in the new America.

09:44.722 --> 09:47.690
Nathaniel Bacon
led the uprising.

09:48.553 --> 09:50.451
POWELL: The Bacon Rebellion was
about the political movement

09:50.486 --> 09:51.625
and economic movement.

09:51.660 --> 09:54.766
It was people
demanding democracy,

09:54.801 --> 09:57.044
a chance to participate
in running the colony,

09:57.079 --> 10:00.323
Virginia colony
and demanding land.

10:01.670 --> 10:03.982
ALLEN: There are these people
coming together

10:04.017 --> 10:06.813
more along class lines
than race lines.

10:07.089 --> 10:09.401
And even though
the colonial government

10:09.436 --> 10:13.751
was eventually successful,
I think that really scared them.

10:16.443 --> 10:18.825
POWELL: The elite decided
to split those groups

10:18.859 --> 10:22.587
and start creating whiteness
in the colonies

10:22.622 --> 10:24.175
and part of their charge,

10:24.209 --> 10:27.005
all the men was to be drafted
into slave patrol

10:27.040 --> 10:29.767
to manage the slaves
for the elites

10:29.801 --> 10:33.598
and they always had this role
of allegiance to the elites

10:33.633 --> 10:37.015
and managing those
underneath for the elites.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.537
ALLEN: This notion
of divide and conquer

10:41.571 --> 10:45.127
to keep poor whites
always knowing

10:45.161 --> 10:47.750
that they were
not at the bottom.

10:48.889 --> 10:52.790
No matter how degraded you may
be as a white, you're white.

10:54.550 --> 10:56.863
And there's one group below you.

10:58.243 --> 11:02.800
That seems very simple enough
but it was a very heavy curse.

11:05.181 --> 11:08.357
CAUSEY: Virginia, where my
ancestors originally settled,

11:08.391 --> 11:12.085
was the first colony to pass
harsher slave laws

11:12.119 --> 11:14.570
that legally sealed
this new alliance

11:14.604 --> 11:17.607
between rich planters
and poor whites.

11:18.919 --> 11:21.163
The first kind of
white privilege that we see

11:21.197 --> 11:24.407
in this country is what was
given to indentured servants

11:24.442 --> 11:27.445
as they were freed up
to have some land,

11:27.479 --> 11:29.447
to have the ability
to be in the militia,

11:29.481 --> 11:32.588
in the slave patrols
to get cloth and tools

11:32.622 --> 11:35.108
and other things
when they were released.

11:35.591 --> 11:37.766
They just still didn't have
economic power

11:37.800 --> 11:41.079
but they had benefits
as white people

11:41.114 --> 11:44.945
and at the same time,
enslaved Africans had nothing.

11:44.980 --> 11:49.053
They had no rights, no property.
Nothing in their name at all.

11:57.095 --> 11:59.926
but there was never much

12:00.271 --> 12:04.275
Our family history haunted me
enough to make this film.

12:04.827 --> 12:09.107
My most famous ancestor was
a guy named Edmund Pendleton

12:09.142 --> 12:12.490
who was a judge,
planter and slave owner.

12:13.042 --> 12:16.045
Pendleton was my uncle
six times removed.

12:16.218 --> 12:18.979
I had known a bit
about Pendleton's life

12:19.014 --> 12:21.050
but in my research
for this film,

12:21.085 --> 12:24.847
I discovered more details
than I ever bargained for.

12:26.953 --> 12:29.887
ANNE CONKLING:
Pendleton was tall, handsome.

12:30.163 --> 12:31.785
He was charming.

12:31.820 --> 12:34.063
He was a brilliant man.

12:34.339 --> 12:36.479
He was an arch-conservative,

12:36.514 --> 12:39.275
what we would today
call right-wing extremist.

12:39.551 --> 12:43.383
He went from being
an arch-conservative

12:43.417 --> 12:46.938
to being a spokesman
for the revolution.

And I was kind of proud to learn
that he played a major role

13:13.931 --> 13:16.209
in helping to establish
the new nation.

13:17.106 --> 13:21.731
CONKLING:
Pendleton drafts the Virginia
Resolution for Independence

13:21.766 --> 13:24.665
and that says that the
delegation be instructed

13:24.700 --> 13:28.324
to propose to declare
the united colonies free

13:28.359 --> 13:31.949
and independent states
absolved from all allegiance

13:31.983 --> 13:36.332
or dependence upon the crown
or parliament of Great Britain.

13:37.471 --> 13:39.888
He wrote all those words
which were then given

13:39.922 --> 13:43.236
to a Pony Express rider who
carried them to Philadelphia.

13:43.339 --> 13:45.686
When they got to Philadelphia,
they said,

13:45.721 --> 13:47.447
Virginia says independence

13:47.481 --> 13:50.036
and all the other colonies
fell into place.

13:50.139 --> 13:53.384
[♪♪♪]

13:55.627 --> 13:58.285
CAUSEY:
But I was really disturbed
to learn that Pendleton

13:58.320 --> 14:01.599
was also asked to write
a controversial line

14:01.633 --> 14:04.188
in the Virginia
Declaration of Rights.

14:04.567 --> 14:08.054
Words that would
institutionalize white supremacy

14:08.088 --> 14:10.884
and reverberate
throughout U.S. history.

14:11.678 --> 14:13.991
I have written
a little bit about

14:14.025 --> 14:16.096
Virginia founder,
Edmund Pendleton

14:16.131 --> 14:18.719
and there's not a lot of people
that know very much

14:18.754 --> 14:23.759
about Edmund Pendleton and
Frances is related to Edmund.

14:24.449 --> 14:26.831
As I understand the history,
they said, "Wait a minute.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.421
We can't have these principles
of liberty applying to slaves."

14:30.524 --> 14:33.631
And so he comes up with the line
basically that signals

14:33.665 --> 14:36.945
in kind of coded language
to the other slave owners

14:36.979 --> 14:40.189
that they're going to exclude
the slaves from liberty.

14:40.327 --> 14:43.744
That all men by nature are
equally free and independent

14:43.779 --> 14:45.298
and have certain rights.

14:45.332 --> 14:46.747
And he came up with the line,

14:46.782 --> 14:50.130
"When they enter into
a state of society"

14:50.165 --> 14:51.960
which everyone
understood to mean

even considered human.

14:59.277 --> 15:02.867
So how would they ever be accepted into civil society?

15:03.281 --> 15:06.250
But still, slavery
was controversial.

15:06.871 --> 15:10.771
I wondered, did Pendleton
and the other founding fathers

15:10.806 --> 15:14.051
have a more pressing reason
to break from Great Britain?

15:16.294 --> 15:21.921
HORNE: London had moved
in Somerset's Case in 1772

15:21.955 --> 15:25.027
to abolish slavery
within England.

15:25.994 --> 15:28.444
There was a lot of fear
and suspicion

15:28.479 --> 15:30.688
on this side of the Atlantic

15:30.722 --> 15:33.863
that that particular decision
would have legs.

15:35.451 --> 15:37.557
CAUSEY: I was always taught
the Revolutionary War

15:37.591 --> 15:39.110
was about things
like freedom

15:39.145 --> 15:41.423
and taxation without
representation.

15:41.837 --> 15:44.115
So was independence
from Great Britain

15:44.150 --> 15:47.705
really much more about
preserving slavery?

15:50.087 --> 15:53.814
KIVEL: Almost every founding
father was a slave owner.

15:54.125 --> 15:57.646
Slavery was an integral part
not just of the Southern economy

15:57.680 --> 15:59.648
but the entire Northern economy.

16:00.338 --> 16:04.722
So it was just completely
integrated into the thinking

16:04.756 --> 16:08.277
of the wealthy men
that wrote the Constitution.

16:09.071 --> 16:11.004
MIKE CHURCH: So the fact that
the constitution is a perfect

16:11.039 --> 16:16.320
instrument is just bogus
from the start if you admit

16:16.354 --> 16:18.943
and this is the only truth that
you can arrive at

16:18.978 --> 16:22.291
and because it did not
ban the slavery

16:22.326 --> 16:23.913
and it left it in there

16:23.948 --> 16:26.640
and it left it as an
open-ended question.

16:26.778 --> 16:31.335
Slavery is definitely
one of the root causes

16:31.369 --> 16:34.752
of the current political melees
that we have today.

16:37.272 --> 16:39.308
CAUSEY: My uncle led
Virginia's ratification

16:39.343 --> 16:42.311
of the U.S. Constitution in 1788

16:42.346 --> 16:44.762
which included
the Three-Fifths Compromise.

16:45.142 --> 16:48.076
Slaves were counted
as three-fifths of a voter.

16:48.283 --> 16:49.905
Those slaves couldn't vote.

16:50.319 --> 16:53.322
Because the South had
more slaves than the North,

16:53.357 --> 16:56.636
this gave the South one third
more congressional seats

16:56.670 --> 17:00.709
and electoral votes
for the next 73 years.

17:01.606 --> 17:04.540
Slaveholding interest would
dominate the government

17:04.575 --> 17:06.680
until the outbreak
of the Civil War.

17:07.405 --> 17:11.167
Not surprisingly, five of the first seven U.S. presidents

17:11.202 --> 17:14.309
were from the South
and were slave owners.

17:17.174 --> 17:18.623
HORNE: The stories
have done a disservice

17:18.657 --> 17:21.281
because you would think that
there are all these genteel men

17:21.316 --> 17:23.455

17:23.490 --> 17:26.147

projects and plans.

17:26.183 --> 17:28.599
Yes, they get their hands dirty
fighting the redcoats

17:28.633 --> 17:31.464
but then it's back to dreaming
up Bill of Rights

17:31.498 --> 17:34.087

and other brilliant ideas

17:34.122 --> 17:39.161
and without the sort of muck
and the grime and the dirt

shed to build this society.

18:05.877 --> 18:09.053
CAUSEY:
But many more slaves than
is commonly acknowledged

18:09.088 --> 18:12.021
resisted the brutality
or tried to escape.

18:12.884 --> 18:16.025
Others organized and rebelled
against their treatment.

18:16.957 --> 18:20.133
A successful and bloody
revolution led by slaves

18:20.168 --> 18:24.448
in nearby Haiti established
the first black-led Republic

18:24.482 --> 18:25.932
in the world.

18:26.174 --> 18:31.006
This revolt terrified American
slave owners like my ancestors

18:31.040 --> 18:34.872
who feared slave rebellions
would spread to the U.S.

18:35.528 --> 18:37.840
I imagine that's why
we never learned much

18:37.875 --> 18:40.395
about the Haitian revolution
in school.

18:41.189 --> 18:44.330
HORNE: The Haitian Revolution
puts the fear of God,

18:44.364 --> 18:48.920
if I may use that phrase into
the brains of slave owners.

18:49.300 --> 18:54.581
It's a major factor in shedding
light on this Negrophobia,

18:54.616 --> 18:57.032
this fear and hatred
of Africans.

18:57.308 --> 19:01.485
You not only have to think
about the classic slave revolts.

19:01.588 --> 19:05.351
Nat Turner, Denmark Vesey,
Gabriel Prosser.

19:06.214 --> 19:08.561
This free labor
comes with a price.

19:08.733 --> 19:10.977
It comes with a price
of having your throat slit

19:11.011 --> 19:12.358
in the middle of the night.

19:12.461 --> 19:16.810
It comes with the price of
eating your scrambled eggs

19:16.845 --> 19:20.435
in the morning and then keeling
over and dying from the poison.

19:20.745 --> 19:23.990
It comes with a price of your
house going up in flames

19:24.024 --> 19:26.061
and your barn
going up in flames

19:26.095 --> 19:29.651
and all the crops going up in
flames by rebellious Africans.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.537
CAUSEY: In the midst
of this national nightmare,

19:53.571 --> 19:56.402
there were white people
who opposed slavery.

19:57.265 --> 20:02.166
There was a growing unease that
this might actually be wrong.

20:02.408 --> 20:04.858
That morally,
it was hard to justify.

20:06.757 --> 20:09.725
CAUSEY: Five Northern states had started to either eliminate

20:09.760 --> 20:12.072
or gradually abolish slavery

20:12.107 --> 20:14.178
and in Virginia of all places,

20:14.213 --> 20:17.906
I discovered a powerful and unusual story from that era

20:17.940 --> 20:20.149
which had been lost to history.

20:21.703 --> 20:26.190
TOM DUCKENFIELD:
We're in Nomini Hall Estate in
Westmoreland County, Virginia.

20:26.501 --> 20:29.366
This is an estate that was
owned by Robert Carter III.

20:30.090 --> 20:34.129
A man who manumitted,
freed my ancestors

20:34.163 --> 20:37.028
with a deed of manumission
in 1791.

20:37.339 --> 20:40.653
So all around here are the land
where my ancestors lived

20:40.687 --> 20:42.689
and worked as slaves

20:42.724 --> 20:46.728
and were eventually freed
gradually over 20 years.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.767
KIVEL:
Carter is a very good example
of one of the richest landowners

20:51.802 --> 20:56.324
in the country who saw
that slavery was wrong

20:56.358 --> 20:58.084
and did something about it.

20:59.637 --> 21:02.744
CAUSEY:
Though he was widely condemned
by other slave owners

21:02.778 --> 21:04.711
and even his own family,

21:04.746 --> 21:09.233
Carter gradually freed
all 452 of his slaves.

21:11.131 --> 21:14.756
LA TONYA LAWSON-JONES:
You can see it in the actual
verbiage of the deed of gift.

21:14.963 --> 21:17.690
He talks about the fact
that he felt

21:17.724 --> 21:21.901
that it was against the
principles of religious justice.

21:22.384 --> 21:25.214
He literally believed that
it was not God's will

21:25.249 --> 21:26.561
to have slaves.

21:29.184 --> 21:32.808
Several of my ancestors
were on that original first 15

21:32.843 --> 21:34.465
that he freed.

21:34.603 --> 21:36.916
One, specifically, Chris Newman.

21:37.019 --> 21:41.196
She was born in 1742
here in America

21:41.230 --> 21:43.612
and she lived here
at Nomini Hall.

21:44.199 --> 21:47.444
When she was freed,
she was 49 years old.

21:47.823 --> 21:49.308
She was a weaver.

21:51.586 --> 21:54.934
DUCKENFIELD:
As freed African Americans,
we had certain advantages.

21:55.072 --> 21:57.454
We had the liberty to go
where we wanted to go.

21:57.488 --> 22:00.042
We had the liberty to work
as much as we wanted to,

22:00.077 --> 22:03.563
to thrive, to provide
for our families.

22:03.701 --> 22:07.049
So we see John Thompson Sr.
owning land

22:07.084 --> 22:08.706
shortly after he was manumitted.

22:08.741 --> 22:10.846
Before that, he owned
personal property items

22:10.881 --> 22:14.781
like horses, pigs, implements,
farm tools, that sort of thing,

22:14.816 --> 22:17.508
but he actually began
to own land about 1820.

22:19.821 --> 22:23.307
CAUSEY:
Tom and La Tonya's ancestors had a very different experience

22:23.342 --> 22:25.516
than most Africans in America.

22:26.552 --> 22:29.140
Not until President
Abraham Lincoln's

22:29.175 --> 22:32.627
Emancipation Proclamation
70 years later

22:32.661 --> 22:34.870
were so many slaves freed.

22:35.699 --> 22:38.357
What would our country
look like today

22:38.391 --> 22:41.187
if others had followed
in Carter's footsteps?

22:42.188 --> 22:43.396
But we didn't.

22:43.569 --> 22:46.572
Instead, we deepened our
commitment to slavery

22:46.606 --> 22:48.608
with even harsher laws.

22:49.126 --> 22:52.509
Sadly, one of the main
architects of those laws

22:52.543 --> 22:55.028
was my uncle, Edmund Pendleton.

22:56.996 --> 22:59.239
DUCKENFIELD:
If you were freed,
you would have to register

23:02.208 --> 23:04.521
and any distinguishing features.

23:05.038 --> 23:09.353
This was to make sure that
you restricted what they did.

slave owners do

Cotton became the most

In this era, one million out

separated from their families

Jim Crow created America's

Intermarrying was illegal to do

It's difficult for me. It's
difficult for all Southerners.

58:10.797 --> 58:13.835
And Supreme Court
or no Supreme Court,

58:13.869 --> 58:17.424
we are going to maintain
segregated schools

58:17.459 --> 58:18.391
down in Dixie.

58:22.533 --> 58:25.502
ALLEN:
There was an understanding that
Southerners were not going

58:25.536 --> 58:29.126
to easily give up their control,
their power,

58:29.160 --> 58:32.854
this idea of ending the
inequality between the races.

58:33.337 --> 58:37.168
[spirited singing]

58:43.727 --> 58:48.041
[spirited singing]

59:05.334 --> 59:06.991
ALLEN: There was always
this understanding

59:07.026 --> 59:10.339
that there was going to need
to be this federal intervention

59:10.374 --> 59:13.170
on the level
of a Civil Rights Act,

59:13.204 --> 59:16.207
the Civil Rights Act of 1964
in this case.

59:18.693 --> 59:21.592
LITWACK:
Lyndon Johnson said, when the
Civil Rights bill had passed,

59:21.627 --> 59:25.423
he said, "I wanted this.
I supported it.

59:26.632 --> 59:30.428
But I'm telling you, I think we
probably lost the South."

59:31.533 --> 59:33.777
But Johnson thought
it was worth it.

59:34.709 --> 59:36.711
[fast paced chanting]

59:36.745 --> 59:42.579
JOHNSON: It's not just Negroes
but really, it's all of us

59:42.613 --> 59:46.859
who must overcome
the crippling legacy

59:46.893 --> 59:51.173
of bigotry and injustice

59:51.208 --> 59:54.038
and we shall overcome.

59:54.176 --> 59:56.558
[applause]

59:57.697 --> 01:00:01.390
CAUSEY: The legal discrimination
against African-Americans

01:00:01.425 --> 01:00:07.086
that began in the 1600s
would officially end in 1964

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.744
with the enactment
of the Civil Rights Act.

01:00:11.746 --> 01:00:15.094
ALLEN: It finally gave some
teeth to the 14th Amendment.

01:00:16.578 --> 01:00:20.720
Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act
of '64 was very, very important

01:00:20.755 --> 01:00:25.414
because it said that if you were
receiving federal monies,

01:00:25.449 --> 01:00:31.144
then you could not discriminate
based on race, gender, religion.

01:00:37.703 --> 01:00:40.326
ROTHSTEIN:
The Civil Rights Movement
began to push back against

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.983
some of these policies.

01:00:42.017 --> 01:00:46.263
Finally in 1968,
a Fair Housing Act was passed

01:00:46.297 --> 01:00:48.783
which said that you couldn't
discriminate

01:00:48.817 --> 01:00:52.131
in the sale or rental of most
housing in the country.

01:00:52.234 --> 01:00:55.755
So for example, Levittown could
no longer bar African-Americans

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:57.032
from moving in.

01:01:02.762 --> 01:01:05.938
LOPEZ:
The Civil Rights Movement
succeeds in making

01:01:05.972 --> 01:01:11.288
the expressed language of racism
unacceptable publicly.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:15.395
It's unacceptable
to say publicly,

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:17.501
"I stand for the white man.

01:01:17.535 --> 01:01:19.606
I believe in white supremacy."

01:01:19.641 --> 01:01:21.505
Now, there are people
saying that

01:01:21.539 --> 01:01:24.508
but they are increasingly on
the fringe of American society,

01:01:24.542 --> 01:01:27.994
the Klan members,
the sort of redneck racists.

01:01:29.927 --> 01:01:33.068
CAUSEY: All across the country,
not just in the South,

01:01:33.103 --> 01:01:37.590
expressions of open racism
instead went underground

01:01:37.624 --> 01:01:41.836
in the form of coded language
or secret political messaging

01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:44.701
meant to appeal
to segregationists.

01:01:45.391 --> 01:01:48.497
I shall help make it possible
for you and your families

01:01:48.532 --> 01:01:51.259
to walk the streets
of our cities in safety.

01:01:53.364 --> 01:01:54.745
NIXON: I'm against busing.

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:57.230
I do not believe
that it serves education

01:01:57.265 --> 01:01:59.750
to pick up children that are two or three yearsbehind

01:01:59.785 --> 01:02:01.545
children in another
school district

01:02:01.579 --> 01:02:04.410
and haul them for a half hour across town to another district.

01:02:06.999 --> 01:02:10.485
CAUSEY: After a short stint in
a public elementary school,

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:15.007
I began attending one of the many white segregated academies

01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:19.666
that were created in the
1960s after desegregation.

01:02:20.081 --> 01:02:23.670
Race relations in the South
were stuck in time.

01:02:24.361 --> 01:02:27.433
All around me, there was
resistance to the changes

01:02:27.467 --> 01:02:29.746
brought by the Civil Rights Act.

01:02:39.169 --> 01:02:43.242
White privilege was finding
a way to maintain itself.

01:02:43.587 --> 01:02:47.177
The national pushback against
the Civil Rights Movement

01:02:47.211 --> 01:02:51.043
and the laws it helped enact
began right away.

01:02:51.526 --> 01:02:53.908
This resistant
eerily mirrored

01:02:53.942 --> 01:02:56.048
what happened
after Reconstruction.

01:02:56.807 --> 01:03:01.087
Political assassinations and the overturning of policies and laws

01:03:01.122 --> 01:03:05.367
gradually destroyed the gains
made by African-Americans.

01:03:06.713 --> 01:03:08.715
From the beginning
of our administration,

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.857
we've taken strong steps to do
something about this horror.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:24.697
WOMAN: They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators.

01:03:32.567 --> 01:03:36.502
[♪♪♪]

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:54.140
WOMAN: I think that Mississippi
has a long way to go.

01:03:55.107 --> 01:03:57.523
There's still such segregation.

01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:02.286
It should have changed
by leaps and bounds

01:04:02.321 --> 01:04:05.324
and maybe it has by a skip.

01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:09.052
[♪♪♪]

01:04:11.157 --> 01:04:14.264
CAUSEY: Back here in Meridian, we found an incident that took place

01:04:14.298 --> 01:04:18.682
in 2003 that struck us
as an enduring example

01:04:18.716 --> 01:04:22.962
of the terrible consequences of not confronting racism directly.

01:04:28.036 --> 01:04:30.556
NEWS ANCHOR: The funerals for three Lockheed employee shot to death

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:32.523
earlier this week
were held today

01:04:32.558 --> 01:04:34.940
in both Mississippi and Alabama.

01:04:34.974 --> 01:04:38.909
Thomas Willis, the father of
three, a Vietnam War vet

01:04:38.944 --> 01:04:40.393
who was honored with
the Purple Heart...

01:04:40.428 --> 01:04:43.224
CAUSEY: I was immediately
drawn to Thomas Willis.

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:47.055
To me, his life
seemed to personify

01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:49.782
the progress that has been made by African-Americans

01:04:49.816 --> 01:04:53.337
in the U.S. since the passage
of the Civil Rights Act.

01:04:53.372 --> 01:04:58.032
[indistinct conversation]

01:04:58.618 --> 01:05:00.931
- Did you know Thomas Willis?
- PETE THREATT: Yes.

01:05:00.966 --> 01:05:03.175
INTERVIEWER:
Played softball with Thomas,
friends with Thomas.

01:05:03.209 --> 01:05:05.798
Can you tell me about Thomas?
What kind of guy he was?

01:05:05.832 --> 01:05:08.663
What impressed me the most
was he had a good work ethic.

01:05:08.697 --> 01:05:10.699
He seemed to be
a very stable individual.

01:05:11.286 --> 01:05:15.187
ERICA TANKS:
Family-oriented, loving,

01:05:15.221 --> 01:05:19.260
strict, firm, fair.

01:05:20.088 --> 01:05:23.747
CAUSEY: Thomas Willis was
a father and a grandfather.

01:05:24.196 --> 01:05:28.372
For an African-American in the South, he was making good money

01:05:28.407 --> 01:05:31.617
in a union job
assembling aircraft wings

01:05:31.651 --> 01:05:33.170
for Lockheed Martin,

01:05:33.205 --> 01:05:36.587
the largest military contractor in the world.

01:05:37.347 --> 01:05:40.005
He took a lot of pride
in what he did

01:05:40.039 --> 01:05:42.041
and was very appreciative
of it.

01:05:42.904 --> 01:05:45.079
CAUSEY: As a U.S. Government contractor,

01:05:45.113 --> 01:05:48.082
Lockheed is barred from
discriminating against people

01:05:48.116 --> 01:05:51.740
based on their race,
color or national origin

01:05:51.775 --> 01:05:54.398
by Title 6
of the Civil Rights Act.

01:05:55.020 --> 01:06:00.577
In 2001, Mr. Willis courageously reported to Lockheed management

01:06:00.611 --> 01:06:03.338
that he and his African-American co-workers

01:06:03.373 --> 01:06:07.515
were being intimidated by a
white employee, Doug Williams.

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:11.726
Williams work the assembly
line alongside Mr. Willis.

01:06:12.451 --> 01:06:14.108
INTERVIEWER: I'm not going
to pull any punches with you.

01:06:14.142 --> 01:06:16.110
I'm going to ask you, do you
believe that Doug Williams

01:06:16.144 --> 01:06:17.594
was a racist?

01:06:17.628 --> 01:06:19.009
THREATT: Check the form.

01:06:19.113 --> 01:06:21.667
He had a problem
with blacks in general

01:06:21.701 --> 01:06:24.152
and some black specifically.

01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:28.398
INTERVIEWER:
Did he ever tell you why he
thought a race war was coming?

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:32.643
He told me on one occasion that he thought that the society

01:06:32.678 --> 01:06:35.715
got to the point where the
blacks were given everything

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:40.168
and the white males no longer
had anybody representing us

01:06:40.203 --> 01:06:42.412
and he thought that
that was the answer.

01:06:42.446 --> 01:06:44.310
Violence was the answer.

01:06:44.517 --> 01:06:48.176
They called in an investigator
to determine if there was

01:06:48.211 --> 01:06:51.697
any type of racial threats
being made

01:06:51.731 --> 01:06:55.459
and Mr. Willis told him exactly
what was going on.

01:06:55.804 --> 01:06:59.808
Thomas' comment to me was that
he felt like the company

01:06:59.843 --> 01:07:01.879
ought to do something

01:07:01.914 --> 01:07:05.918
and that he wasn't going to quit until something was done.

01:07:06.436 --> 01:07:10.164
He gave them at least three
examples of death threats

01:07:10.198 --> 01:07:12.235
that were racially motivated

01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:15.376
and they were directed at blacks
working in the plant.

01:07:16.411 --> 01:07:19.621
CAUSEY: Doug Williams was
ordered to attend diversity

01:07:19.656 --> 01:07:24.350
and anger management classes
but repeatedly refused to go.

01:07:24.799 --> 01:07:27.457
According to his
African-American co-workers,

01:07:27.491 --> 01:07:30.011
he continued his racial taunts.

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:35.258
One day, Williams put a
white work booty on his head.

01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:37.605
I'm from the South.

01:07:37.639 --> 01:07:43.611
Everybody that I know,
know what that signify.

01:07:44.612 --> 01:07:48.340
CAUSEY: Some African-American employees assumed he was imitating

01:07:48.374 --> 01:07:49.962
the Ku Klux Klan

01:07:49.996 --> 01:07:53.034
and reported the incident
to their supervisors.

01:07:53.966 --> 01:07:57.245
BLAIR:
He wore that not for a little
while. He wore that all day.

01:07:57.418 --> 01:07:59.661
Finally, the assistant plant
manager comes back down

01:07:59.696 --> 01:08:01.974
and says, "Doug, Mr. Williams,

01:08:02.008 --> 01:08:03.907
you've got to take that
booty off your head."

01:08:03.941 --> 01:08:06.116
Their conversation
was quite escalated.

01:08:06.358 --> 01:08:09.464
Jack insisting that he pull
the cap off, Doug refusing.

01:08:09.706 --> 01:08:12.709
And he wanted to know not
why he had to take it off.

01:08:12.743 --> 01:08:15.056
He wanted to know
who had reported him.

01:08:15.539 --> 01:08:17.058
He wanted the names.

01:08:17.714 --> 01:08:21.200
He did not want to give in
because he thought that

01:08:21.234 --> 01:08:24.479
he had been falsely
accused in this situation,

01:08:24.514 --> 01:08:26.447
that his intent was not racial.

01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:31.037
It was merely the hazing
of the new employee

01:08:31.072 --> 01:08:32.417
or a practical joke.

01:08:33.661 --> 01:08:38.010
CAUSEY: Without approval from Lockheed, Williams took a week off.

01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:41.462
When he did return to work,
he wasn't punished.

01:08:41.979 --> 01:08:45.121
Lockheed again ordered him
to diversity class

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:47.468
and again, he refused to go.

01:08:48.779 --> 01:08:50.609
BLAIR:
He was having a lot of anger

01:08:50.643 --> 01:08:53.059
about what Lockheed Martin
was doing to him.

01:08:53.198 --> 01:08:56.752
Went out to his truck,
got his guns and came back

01:08:56.787 --> 01:08:58.582
and that's when
the shooting started.

01:08:58.617 --> 01:09:00.791
[gunshots]

01:09:00.826 --> 01:09:05.348
He had shotgun in his hand,
rifle on his back,

01:09:05.381 --> 01:09:07.626
bullets draped around
both sides of him.

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.662
And I got a good look
at his eyes

01:09:09.697 --> 01:09:12.527
and I'm not going to say
per se he snapped

01:09:12.562 --> 01:09:16.290
but there was something
there that was out there.

01:09:16.566 --> 01:09:19.569
[gunshots]

01:09:25.264 --> 01:09:28.542
THREATT:
Storms in the room, he goes
by numerous white employees,

01:09:28.578 --> 01:09:31.684
doesn't shoot anybody and Mickey Fitzgerald, a brave man,

01:09:31.719 --> 01:09:34.308
he was a white guy stood up
and said,

01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:36.517
"Doug, you don't want
to do this." Doug kills him.

01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:38.863
Just pointblank
shot him in the head.

01:09:42.281 --> 01:09:46.216
CAUSEY: Williams then shot Sam Cockrell whom Williams believed

01:09:46.251 --> 01:09:48.736
had complained to management
about him.

01:09:50.358 --> 01:09:53.741
THREATT: And he goes straight to the area where the black co-workers

01:09:53.774 --> 01:09:55.881
that he had been
intimidating worked.

01:09:56.261 --> 01:09:59.540
He went around and shot us
how he wanted to shoot us,

01:09:59.574 --> 01:10:01.127
where he wanted to shoot us.

01:10:07.962 --> 01:10:11.690
THREATT:
He stood over Lynette McCall
and she begged for her life.

01:10:12.518 --> 01:10:15.659
He shot Thomas Willis in the
back as he was running away.

01:10:18.662 --> 01:10:20.906
We stepped over there to see
what Shirley was saying

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:24.220
and she was saying, "He's killed
himself. He's killed himself."

01:10:24.496 --> 01:10:28.293
[♪♪♪]

01:10:32.676 --> 01:10:36.162
I remember regrouping
emotionally

01:10:36.197 --> 01:10:38.268
and it seemed like
I was in a daze.

01:10:41.754 --> 01:10:45.655
It was devastating because
we just buried my mother

01:10:45.689 --> 01:10:48.278
and I was like,
"This can't be happening."

01:10:48.968 --> 01:10:50.349
And, um...

01:10:57.839 --> 01:10:59.841
BLAIR:
The police found Thomas.

01:11:00.325 --> 01:11:02.465

Wrongful Death Statute

for Mr. Willis being murdered

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:10.705
in an intentional act.

01:12:10.947 --> 01:12:13.398
It went to the Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals

01:12:13.432 --> 01:12:15.676
which threw the case out
based on the fact

01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:17.747

a workplace accident.

At the time of the massacre,

01:12:42.392 --> 01:12:45.257
Lockheed held federal
military contracts

of violating Thomas Willis and
his colleagues' civil rights,

01:12:54.439 --> 01:12:58.063
it would have lost its lucrative government contracts.

01:12:58.788 --> 01:13:03.586
Today, Lockheed is still the
largest employer in the area.

a fairly significant effort

become too public.

01:13:16.219 --> 01:13:19.187

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:55.004
their children
and so on and so forth.

01:22:59.629 --> 01:23:01.977
POWELL: The hard nut of it
is really whites.

01:23:02.701 --> 01:23:06.843
So we had it exactly backwards
in terms of the Negro problem.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.949
We have a white problem
in the United States

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:12.435
and I don't mean this
as a blame and whatever

01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:14.851
but I think people won't get
this on their own.

01:23:14.886 --> 01:23:16.646
It really takes a lot of work.

01:23:16.681 --> 01:23:20.926
This is so deeply in our DNA and
it's reflected in our politics,

01:23:20.961 --> 01:23:23.239
the way we do politics,
the way we do our economy

01:23:23.274 --> 01:23:25.000
and the way we think
about ourselves.

01:23:25.034 --> 01:23:27.933
But we actually need to give
birth to a new white identity,

01:23:27.968 --> 01:23:30.108
a white identity that
doesn't need to dominate,

01:23:30.143 --> 01:23:32.524
a white identity
that's not totally angst

01:23:32.559 --> 01:23:35.320
about being in connection
and relationship with the other,

01:23:35.355 --> 01:23:38.910
a white identity that recognizes
that it is the other.

[♪♪♪]

01:23:42.845 --> 01:23:45.537
CAUSEY: But to do this,
we have to recognize

01:23:45.572 --> 01:23:49.334
that we as white people
have benefited enormously

01:23:49.369 --> 01:23:53.511
from our privilege at
the expense of other people.

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:57.066
The cost of this prejudice
and inequality

01:23:57.101 --> 01:23:59.758
has come at far too high
a price.

01:24:00.414 --> 01:24:03.762
Why are we so afraid
to face the possibility

01:24:03.797 --> 01:24:08.940
that we might actually gain
something with true equality?
