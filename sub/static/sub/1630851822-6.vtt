Yep.

00:12.721 --> 00:16.433

00:16.516 --> 00:19.853
<i>But I know that I still have</i>
<i>so much more to learn.</i>

00:19.936 --> 00:21.521
Okay, last one.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.232
<i>So I'm continuing my lessons</i>
<i>from my own kitchen</i>

00:24.315 --> 00:27.569

<i>all across the country.</i>

00:27.652 --> 00:29.487
<i>Which means we can still have</i>
<i>a great time</i>

[doorbell rings]
Hey, guys?

00:36.494 --> 00:37.829
Do you mind grabbing
the groceries?

00:37.912 --> 00:40.874
- Yes. Let's get this.
- All right.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.209
- See who it is today.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.253

00:45.336 --> 00:46.796
- Hey, I got a delivery
for you guys.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.465
- All right.
- Thank you so much.

00:48.548 --> 00:49.758
- No problem, you guys.
Take care.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.009
- You too.
- Later.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.302
- He was cute.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.471
- Another tattoo hottie today,
you guys.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.847
- We love to see it.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.057
- You didn't talk to him
for very long this time.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.934
- I'm trying to play it
more cool 'cause it's not

01:00.018 --> 01:02.562
been going well me
being a little bit too eager.

01:02.645 --> 01:04.189
So I'm trying to take
a different approach.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.315
- Wow. Okay.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.066
- I respect that about you.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.193
- There's a lot.

01:08.276 --> 01:11.362
- Raw honey. Garlic.
- Yum.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.072
- What's this?
- A coconut.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.824
- [laughs]
- Unbelievable.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.409
- Oh, cum-in seeds.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.744
- I think it's cumin.

01:17.827 --> 01:21.164
- Cumin. Okay, cool.
- Ooh.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.875
- So Sel, you got all this.
We're gonna head out.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.376
- [laughs]
- All right.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.086
It's been fun.
- No, I need help.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.379
- Whoo-hoo.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.882
- Selena and Padma. Take one.

- I'm about to make you bitches
work.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.774
[laughter]
Where do we start?

03:11.858 --> 03:13.318
- So the first thing
we're gonna do

03:13.401 --> 03:15.653
is we're gonna make the shrimp.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.906
Do you have a wok
or, like, a skillet?

03:17.989 --> 03:20.408
- Let's see.
- I think we do.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.285
[pots clattering]
- Oh, oh, oh.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.620
[laughter]

03:23.703 --> 03:25.955
Like this?
- That's perfect.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.749
<i>We're gonna use that</i>
<i>in a minute.</i>

03:27.832 --> 03:30.209
But first we have to do
all of our mise en place.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.544
- Okay.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.712
- So get three or four

03:32.795 --> 03:34.130
medium shallots.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.798
Take a good sharp knife.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.300
Be careful.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.261
You're gonna cut off
the stem part of the shallot

03:40.345 --> 03:42.805
and then cut off
the other side as well.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.515
You can cut them in half.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.310
And then they should
be easy to peel.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.729
There you go.
You're doing it. Perfect.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.981
- Doing it.
- Oh yeah.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.484
- Did you do lots of cooking
during COVID?

03:54.567 --> 03:57.445
- I did. I cooked my butt off
during COVID.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.073
I made a lot of
south Indian recipes actually

04:00.156 --> 04:02.283
'cause I missed my mom
and I missed my family.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.993
- Aw.
- Yeah.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.663
- And so I went back to cooking
a lot of this kind of food.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.165
- Oh, nice.
- Selena, how old were you

04:09.248 --> 04:10.959
<i>when you did</i>
<i>your first record?</i>

04:11.042 --> 04:13.920
- 15. Which was funny
'cause it's like,

04:14.003 --> 04:16.923
what am I gonna talk about
when I'm 15, like?

04:17.006 --> 04:19.133
[laughter]
- Yes.

04:19.217 --> 04:21.886
Okay.
Grab the half shallot.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.513
We're gonna cut them
into slices.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.766
So just rest the knife
against your knuckle.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.768
You're gonna push down
with the tip.

04:28.851 --> 04:31.229
Roll the knife backwards
with pressure

04:31.312 --> 04:34.107
<i>so that you go tip</i>
<i>to stem like that.</i>

04:34.190 --> 04:36.526
And just be really careful
and go slow.

04:36.609 --> 04:37.652
- Okay.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.404
Sometimes I need
a little reminder

04:39.487 --> 04:41.197
on my knife skills.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.740
- Oh, okay.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.535
- Lots of injuries on
"Selena and Chef" this season.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.370
- Oh, my God,
please don't tell me that.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.247

04:49.330 --> 04:50.456

04:52.417 --> 04:53.835
I can't--see?

04:53.918 --> 04:56.045
- Unbelievable.
- Is it...?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.047
Oh!
[laughter]

04:58.131 --> 04:59.799
- Can I tell you something?

04:59.882 --> 05:03.344
<i>I've been in food</i>
<i>for 20 years professionally,</i>

05:03.428 --> 05:07.682
and I still suck at cutting
onions and things like that.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.184
- Okay.
- So I wouldn't worry about it.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.561
- Ooh.
- Oh, no.

05:11.644 --> 05:12.895
- I feel it in my eyes.
- My eyes.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.313
- I think we're doing
a good job.

05:14.397 --> 05:17.734
We're crying.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.110
<i>- So here's a funny thing.</i>

05:19.193 --> 05:22.071
You can get
onion-cutting goggles

- Why are those so chic?

- Oh, my gosh,
why is it, like, Gucci?

I've looked on this show yet.

- Television, baby.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.652
- So now you're gonna just

06:01.736 --> 06:03.112
get your cherry tomatoes.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.240
and these you're just
going to cut in quarters.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.117
- Should we cut the whole bowl?
- The whole bowl.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.203
- Okay.
- Okay, we'll help.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.121
Oh, this is intricate work,
guys.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.457
- Have you always lived
on the East Coast?

06:14.540 --> 06:16.626
- Mostly I've lived
on the East Coast.

06:16.709 --> 06:20.630
But I also lived in Italy
for a lot of my 20s.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.006
- Ooh.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.299
- I loved being in Italy

06:23.382 --> 06:25.051
because also I was on my own.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.845
It was when I just had
gotten out of college

06:27.929 --> 06:30.389
and had real freedom
for the first time.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.058
I started modelling there.

06:32.141 --> 06:34.727
<i>And that's when I discovered</i>
<i>how much I loved cooking</i>

06:34.811 --> 06:37.563
because I just fell in love
with Italian food

06:37.647 --> 06:39.440
and French food.
- Mm-hmm.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.275
<i>- I don't think I could do</i>
<i>the work</i>

06:41.359 --> 06:43.152
that I do today in food

06:43.236 --> 06:44.987
if I hadn't
had that experience.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.031
- That's so cool. I love that.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.908
- Okay, so do you guys
have enough tomatoes?

06:48.991 --> 06:50.660
- I think so, yeah.
- Yeah.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.996
- So now we're gonna move on
to the bell pepper.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.332
<i>Grab your knife.</i>
- Yes.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.834
- And hold it like that.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.335
- Oh.

06:59.418 --> 07:02.338
You know what? I'm gonna take
a little knife break.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.590
So how about you try this,
Theresa?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.050
- All right.
- Please enter.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.677
I'm a little sensitive
right now.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.012
So you go.
- All right, let's do this.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.390
- Okay, so take the tip
of your knife

07:12.473 --> 07:14.100
and just pierce the slit.

07:14.183 --> 07:18.187
And you're just gonna basically
cut the core out of it.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.065
And then you just wanna
take out all the stuff inside

07:21.149 --> 07:22.733
and then cut it in quarters.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.695
- Is it hard to cut stuff
in those nails though?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.321
- Yeah, kind of.

07:27.405 --> 07:31.033
- And then you're gonna cut
those into 1-inch dices.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.243
- Got it.
- Great.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.786
- So put those in a bowl.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.163
- All right.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.707
- Okay, so now we're going
to do the ginger.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.250
- Oh, this is gonna
be delicious,

07:39.333 --> 07:41.544
I can already tell.
Pepper, tomato, ginger.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.254
- I know, a lot of flavors
are happening.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.755
- Yeah.

07:44.839 --> 07:48.634
- So trim the smaller fingers
of the ginger away.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.762
And just use that main,
fattest, biggest piece.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.139
- Okay.

07:53.222 --> 07:56.058
- You wanna just try
and get the peel off.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.102
- Okay, let's try it.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.687
[laughter]

07:59.770 --> 08:01.772
Let's try it.
- Take a deep breath.

08:01.856 --> 08:02.982
- Okay. So.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.401
- Just watch.
- Don't go away.

08:05.484 --> 08:08.779
Just follow the shape
of the ginger.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.073
- Oh, no. Okay.
- Wait.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.408
- Look at her.

08:12.491 --> 08:16.412
- Gently. Slowly. Try to use--

08:16.495 --> 08:18.581
- Ugh.
- Yeah, no.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.499
- You know what?
We don't have to--

08:20.583 --> 08:23.544
- Paige, why don't you come
and take the stage?

08:23.628 --> 08:27.048
This episode of Selena
takes a break from knives.

08:27.131 --> 08:29.175
[laughter]

08:29.258 --> 08:33.387
<i>- Okay, just be really careful</i>
<i>and go really slowly.</i>

08:33.471 --> 08:35.431
<i>So just go around the piece</i>

08:35.514 --> 08:37.642
<i>and get as much off</i>
<i>as you can.</i>

08:37.725 --> 08:40.519
That's great. Okay, so now
you have your peeled ginger.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.104
- Thank you.
- All right.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.815
<i>- So you wanna take</i>
<i>the big knob of ginger</i>

08:44.899 --> 08:48.611
and cut it in half.
Like that.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.112
- Okay.
- Good job.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.114
- And then just
cut little strips.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.826
Like little matchsticks.
As skinny as you can.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.161
- Nice.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.621
- Take a quarter
of those matchsticks

08:58.704 --> 09:00.081
and bunch 'em up like that.

09:00.164 --> 09:03.459
And then just cut those
as tiny as you can.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.586
- Good job.
- That looks great.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.296
- We're acting like she's,
like, our, like,

09:07.380 --> 09:09.006
five-year-old sister.
- I know.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.133
- Even injuries, I'm like...
- You gotta celebrate--

09:11.217 --> 09:12.593
- Y'all wanna try?
- Yes.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.470
- Celebrate--
- Small wins. Small wins.

09:14.553 --> 09:16.806
- Celebrate the small wins.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.474
- Do you have any other kids?

09:18.557 --> 09:20.977
- No, just the one.
She's plenty.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.729
- Aw, she's beautiful.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

09:23.813 --> 09:25.648
You know, I always knew
I wanted to be a mom.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.608
I never knew
it would be so much fun.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.819
- I have
a seven-year-old sister.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.153
- Oh, okay.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.488
- I get to be, like, the cool

09:32.572 --> 09:34.782
big sister, and I love it.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.784
I hang out with her more
than anybody else.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.411
- You do.
- It's your bestie.

09:38.494 --> 09:41.539
- Let's peel the garlic.
I just need a couple cloves.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.041
- You know what?
I found some peeled ones.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.294
So we're in luck.
<i>- Okay, great.</i>

09:46.377 --> 09:48.796
<i>So get two of those.</i>
<i>And then we'll just go ahead</i>

09:48.879 --> 09:51.132
and get the preserved lemon
and apricots.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.718
- Dried apricot.
<i>- You wanna just cut</i>

09:53.801 --> 09:56.345
each apricot into six pieces.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.056
- Of the whole bag?
- No. [laughs]

09:59.140 --> 10:01.517
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

10:01.600 --> 10:03.352
- [laughs]
- Ugh.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.645
- Really?

10:04.729 --> 10:06.981
- Thanks, guys.
I'm a pathetic loser.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.609
<i>- So you want</i>
<i>about 1/3 cup.</i>

10:10.693 --> 10:12.403
For me, that is about a dozen.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.863
- Okay.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.824
- And then you just wanna
cut these into small bits.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.367
You're gonna also do
the same thing

10:18.451 --> 10:20.411
with
the Moroccan preserved lemons.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.581
<i>Open that.</i>
<i>You want one whole lemon.</i>

10:23.664 --> 10:26.167
- [laughs] Wow.
- Don't worry about it.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.543
<i>[quirky music]</i>

10:27.626 --> 10:29.545
- It's really weird.
<i>- It's gooey.</i>

10:29.628 --> 10:32.006
<i>I can see by the color of them</i>
<i>that they're nice.</i>

10:32.089 --> 10:33.632
- I like it.
- Okay.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.718
- Cut it in half
down the middle.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.178
- Got it.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.055
- And then you wanna take
all of the seeds out.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.349
- Okay.
<i>- And chop 'em into bits.</i>

10:41.432 --> 10:43.142
- I've never seen lemons
like this.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.895
- They're preserved
in salt and water.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.898
<i>And you just let them</i>
<i>sit there for months on end.</i>

10:48.981 --> 10:52.068
And they become
this fermented pickled lemon.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.402
- Mm.
- Wow.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.696
<i>- So now we have</i>
<i>all the things we need.</i>

10:55.780 --> 10:57.281
Do you wanna get
the spices out?

10:57.365 --> 11:00.409
- Sure.
- These spices look awesome.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.287
- Okay, so you're gonna need
two dried chilies.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.997
- Two dried chilies.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.166
<i>- And then you need</i>
<i>fennel and cumin.</i>

11:07.249 --> 11:08.918
- These ones.
- Okay.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.130
[laughter]
- What?

11:14.632 --> 11:16.967
- All right,
so get your frying pan.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.095
- Thank you, babe. Sorry.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.806
- Add some oil to the pan.
- Okay.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.392
<i>- A little bit, like,</i>
<i>2 or 3 tablespoons.</i>

11:24.475 --> 11:27.478
Keep going.
That's good. Stop.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.815
So turn your stove
onto medium heat.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.066
- Okay.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.901
- Once your oil is hot
you're gonna add

11:33.984 --> 11:36.779
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds

11:36.862 --> 11:39.281
and 1/2 teaspoon
of fennel seeds.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.117
- Okay.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.953
- That's a lot of cumin.
- Oh, no.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.705
- Is that 1/2 teaspoon?

11:46.789 --> 11:48.833
- I think it was
a full teaspoon.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.002
- Okay, just take some out.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.963
- Sorry.
- [laughs]

11:54.046 --> 11:56.173
- She said, "That's a lot."

11:56.257 --> 11:57.550
- So this is 1 teaspoon.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.051
- I'm sorry.
- So, like, half of this.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.261
- Okay. There we go.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.763
- Great.
So now add your shallots.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.098
- Okay.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.475
- And then add
your two cloves of garlic.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.936
- The smell's coming
in really nice.

12:09.019 --> 12:11.480
- Add your ginger now.
- Okay.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.650
<i>- Are the onions getting a</i>
<i>little translucent and glassy?</i>

12:14.733 --> 12:16.152
- Yeah.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.487
- Now you're gonna add
the two dried red chilies.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.656
- Not cut or anything,
just throw them in, right?

12:20.739 --> 12:24.076
- Yeah. So then you're
gonna add the bell pepper.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.495
- Yum.
- Your salt.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.748
And add your turmeric as well.
That's the yellow powder.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.709
- How much turmeric?
<i>- Not that much.</i>

12:31.792 --> 12:33.335
<i>Like, literally 1/4 teaspoon.</i>

12:33.419 --> 12:34.670
- Okay.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.589
- And now you're gonna add
the tomatoes.

12:36.672 --> 12:40.509
<i>And if your pan is getting dry</i>
<i>you can always add butter.</i>

12:40.593 --> 12:42.011
- Yeah, let's do it.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.638
<i>- So swirl the butter around</i>
<i>so it melts.</i>

12:44.722 --> 12:47.349
And then get the shrimp
out of the fridge

12:47.433 --> 12:50.603
<i>as well as one cut lemon</i>
<i>and some salt.</i>

12:50.686 --> 12:53.189
- Okey-dokey.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.232
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>We're just going to add</i>

12:55.316 --> 12:58.277
a tiny pinch of salt,
like 1/2 teaspoon

12:58.360 --> 13:00.446
for about a pound of shrimp.
- Got it.

13:00.529 --> 13:03.407
- And then you're gonna squeeze
the juice of one lemon

13:03.491 --> 13:06.160
and just let that sit
for a few minutes.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.870
Let's check the tomato.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.413
- Okay.
- Mm.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.082
<i>- It's looking good.</i>
- Yeah, it's unbelievable.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.334
- Smells really good.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.835
- At this point I want you

13:14.919 --> 13:18.380
to add the preserved lemon
as well as the apricots.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.341
- Okay.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.886
- So now toss all your shrimp
into that tomato sauce.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.347
- Ooh, yummy.
- [laughs]

13:26.430 --> 13:28.891
- Just, like,
stir it up really evenly.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.184
It'll cook pretty fast.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.560
- Love this.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.813
- And then you wanna add
some chopped cilantro.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.774
- Okay.
- And stir it up.

13:36.857 --> 13:37.942
- Great.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.902
- Perfect.
And this dish is done.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.946
That's all there is to it.
- Yum.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.740
- And this is a super duper
healthy dish.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.409
Like, it has no calories
and lots of protein.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.078
- It looks so good.
- Wow.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.412
<i>- Put the cover on it.</i>

13:50.496 --> 13:52.581
Make sure the heat
is completely off.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.167
<i>And just set it to the side.</i>
- Okay.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.211
<i>- We're doing</i>
<i>the rice recipe now.</i>

13:57.294 --> 13:59.922
We're gonna make a coconut rice
or a pilaf.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.925
- Okay, rice. Thank you.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.052
- So now we're gonna
break a coconut.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.136
- Okay.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.264
- Coconut.
- Coconut time?

14:08.347 --> 14:12.851
- So you need to find
the hardest surface you can.

14:12.935 --> 14:16.897
Okay? I think that you will
break your marble counter.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.524
- Uh.
- [laughs]

14:18.607 --> 14:21.735
- If you have, like,
concrete somewhere.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.613
- Should we do it on the floor?
- That would be better.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.990
- Floor is fine.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.117
- So I'm gonna show you
how I'm doing this

14:28.200 --> 14:30.077
on my granite counter. Okay?

14:30.160 --> 14:31.996
- Okay.
<i>- Can you see me?</i>

14:32.079 --> 14:34.039
- Yes.
- Okay.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.626
both: Oh. [laugh]

14:37.710 --> 14:39.712
- Be careful of your fingers.

14:39.795 --> 14:42.214
- This isn't gonna be good
on our end.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.633
- It's not.
- So where are you gonna do it?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.051
On the ground?
- Right here.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.304
- Just get a bowl
or something that you can

14:48.387 --> 14:51.390
collect the coconut water.
Go.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.434
- Oh, the bottom--

14:53.517 --> 14:56.312
- She smashed it.
- All right! Good girl.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.106
- Ah, I did it!
- Whoo!

14:59.189 --> 15:01.025
She enjoyed that
a little too much.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.027
The smile just got so big.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.195
<i>- That's great.</i>
<i>Good for you.</i>

15:05.279 --> 15:09.199
I was worried about that.
- Okay, done.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.368
- So get a big knife.
- Okay.

15:11.452 --> 15:14.163
- And then you wanna put
the coconut on its side

15:14.246 --> 15:16.624
and make a cut into it.
Like that.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.918
And then you're gonna make
another cut into it to make,

15:20.002 --> 15:22.212
like, a piece of a triangle.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.339
- Oh!
- Nope.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.632
- Oh, no.
- Oi.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.050
<i>- And then you</i>
<i>just wanna wedge</i>

15:26.133 --> 15:29.178
your knife
in between the hard shell.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.056
- It's not in the cards for me.
I'm sorry.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.891
- It's just, like,
a weird angle.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.810
- The more you go into
the coconut the easier it gets

15:36.894 --> 15:38.604
<i>and the bigger</i>
<i>the pieces become.</i>

15:38.687 --> 15:40.272
- Ooh, I'm definitely
trying a piece.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.566
- This is hard.
<i>- You're doing great.</i>

15:42.650 --> 15:44.318
<i>It's not an easy thing to do.</i>

15:44.401 --> 15:46.445
I've grown up doing it
all my life

15:46.528 --> 15:47.946
and it's still hard for me.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.449
- You think this is enough?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

15:50.532 --> 15:52.034
- Here we go.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.035
- Oh!

15:53.118 --> 15:55.079
[laughter]

15:55.162 --> 15:56.538
- This is so good.

15:56.622 --> 16:00.209
- Okay, put all these pieces
into the blender.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.710
Start out slow.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.589
- Ah!
- Whoo-hoo!

16:05.673 --> 16:08.842
- It looks like a blizzard.
- Yeah.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.427
- It worked.
<i>- Great.</i>

16:10.511 --> 16:13.305
You're going to need
about a cup and a half

16:13.389 --> 16:15.432
<i>of shredded coconut.</i>
- Okay.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.935
- So we have to cut
some more ginger.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.770
Whoever wants to do
that can do that.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.397
- Yeah, we're cutting it
the same way, right?

16:21.480 --> 16:23.982
- Exactly the same way, yes.
Thank you.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.943
- Yeah, Paige Holden.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.030
- I was literally
gonna say that.

16:30.114 --> 16:33.701
- Okay, so you're going to need
red chilies again.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.161
<i>But also two</i>
<i>fresh green chilies.</i>

16:36.245 --> 16:38.080
- Okay.
- Some cashews,

16:38.163 --> 16:39.998
<i>about 1/4 cup.</i>
- Yum.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.751
- You also wanna mise out
your two kinds of lentils.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.296
You have a bigger lentil that
looks like a tiny orange

16:46.380 --> 16:47.840
that's been cut in half.

16:47.923 --> 16:51.385
That's called Chana Dal.
- Got it.

16:51.468 --> 16:52.803
- You want a tablespoon.
- Yummy.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.972
- The other one
is called Urad Dal.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.348
- Okay.
- You want, like,

16:56.432 --> 16:58.058
a 3/4 teaspoon
to a teaspoon.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.351
- Nice.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.395
- So those chilies
look pretty big.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.689
I would cut them.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.065
- [sighing] Okay.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.401
<i>- Into, like,</i>
<i>four long pieces.</i>

17:07.484 --> 17:09.945
- Awesome.
The struggle is real.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.488
- Yeah.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.323
- And then you should have
a little spice

17:13.407 --> 17:15.159
called asafetida.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.619
- The ass of fetida.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.413
[laughter]

17:19.496 --> 17:21.498
- You're such a child.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.626
- Okay, we need 15
to 20 curry leaves.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.004
<i>So they're really easy</i>
<i>to pop off. Watch this.</i>

17:27.087 --> 17:29.631
You just take it at the bottom
and you go like that.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.008
- Ooh.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.342
- Okay, that's good.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.636
- And then the last thing
is mustard seeds.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.221
- How much mustard seeds?

17:36.305 --> 17:38.307
- 1/2 teaspoon.
- Okay.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.142
- All right,
so get a frying pan

17:40.225 --> 17:42.311
preferably non-stick
if you can.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.438
- What about this?
- That's prefect.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.774
- So the smell
that you're going to smell

17:46.857 --> 17:48.901
when this starts popping
is the smell

17:48.984 --> 17:51.945
that I associate most
with my childhood.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.447
- Aww.

17:53.530 --> 17:57.868
- So we're gonna turn on
the stove on medium high heat.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.454
- Okay.
- And then you're going to add

18:00.537 --> 18:03.165
about 3 tablespoons
of canola oil.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.708
- Okay.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.669
- And we're going to be adding
all of these ingredients.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.756
- It's party time. Can't wait
to smell it all together.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.508
[laughter]

18:12.591 --> 18:13.842
- Okay. All right.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.178
So you're gonna add
your mustard seeds.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.515
Then you're gonna put in
both of your types of lentil.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.058
- Oh, I almost dropped it.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.852
- And you're also going to add
your ginger to this.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.854
And it should start sizzling
a little bit.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.064
- Got it.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.982
- Add the cashews
and the asafetida.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.192
- Okay.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.361
- Put both kinds
of chilies in there.

18:32.444 --> 18:36.365
And then you're gonna put in
curry leaves and stir.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.076
And then put in
your coconut as well.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.870
- Whoo-hoo.
- Wow, that smells so good.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.206
- You're gonna start to hear
the mustard seeds

18:44.289 --> 18:45.749
pop out of the pan.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.293
- We're popping over here.
- Okay, good.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.045
So now you wanna
take your rice.

18:50.128 --> 18:51.547
- Okay.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.424
- And just add it to your pan
in little handfuls.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.552
But you want
to kinda sprinkle it

18:56.635 --> 18:59.054
'cause you wanna keep
the grains of rice whole.

18:59.137 --> 19:00.931
<i>You don't wanna break 'em.</i>
- Okay.

19:01.014 --> 19:04.685
- And then you just wanna fold
and toss this gently.

19:04.768 --> 19:07.145
Like, go from underneath
and then lift up.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.313
Yeah. Exactly.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.899
- I love the way this smells.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.402
<i>- We usually eat</i>
<i>this coconut rice</i>

19:13.485 --> 19:15.404
for brunch or for tiffin.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.990
Tiffin is a meal that we eat
in India

19:18.073 --> 19:20.576
around 4:00 or 5:00 with tea.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.119
It's, like,
tea time in England.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.788
<i>It's from colonialism.</i>
- Ahh.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.373
- And don't forget to add salt.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.584
<i>I would add</i>
<i>about a teaspoon to start.</i>

19:28.667 --> 19:30.127
- Okay.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.254
- So you can just take
a little tasting spoon

19:32.337 --> 19:33.839
<i>and taste that.</i>
<i>See if it needs</i>

19:33.922 --> 19:35.757
<i>a little bit more salt.</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:38.552
- [laughs] She's happy.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.596
- All right,
so you're basically done.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.930
Like, it's cooked.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.182
- All right,
this is pretty damn good.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.267
- [laughs]

19:45.350 --> 19:46.602
- Oh, it's got a kick.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.853
[laughter]

19:47.936 --> 19:49.313
You wanna stir?

19:49.396 --> 19:51.773
- So do you wanna learn
how to make masala chai,

19:51.857 --> 19:54.109
which is masala tea?
- Yeah.

19:54.192 --> 19:55.986
- Okay.
Should we clean this up?

19:56.069 --> 19:58.780
- What ingredients do we need
for the chai tea?

19:58.864 --> 20:02.284
- It's just chai.
Chai is the Hindi word for tea.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.037
I know people in America
like to say chai tea,

20:05.120 --> 20:08.540
but what you're actually saying
is just tea tea.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.293
- So embarrassing.
- Do we need boiled water?

20:11.376 --> 20:14.796
- Yes, we do.
Measure 4 cups.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.466
- Oh, I love Raque-poo.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.052
- So do you just have
the one sister

20:20.135 --> 20:21.720
or do you have more siblings?

20:21.803 --> 20:24.014
- I do.
But I grew up an only child

20:24.097 --> 20:26.099
'cause my mom had me
when she was 16.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.476
- Wow.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.895
- I have a friend
who also has a very young mom.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.355
- It's very interesting.

20:31.438 --> 20:34.650
It's like you kind of
are growing up together.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.027
It's weird.
But it's awesome.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.029
- I, on the other hand,

20:39.112 --> 20:42.240
had what they called
a geriatric pregnancy.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.785
- What?
- I had Krishna when I was 39.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.954
It's horrible to read that,
by the way.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.331
<i>And I remember, like,</i>
<i>being in my hospital bed</i>

20:49.414 --> 20:52.709
<i>and hearing a nurse</i>
<i>discussing it with this doctor</i>

20:52.793 --> 20:54.962
<i>that was on call,</i>
<i>and they were whispering.</i>

20:55.045 --> 20:58.173
And they said, like, "Well,
she is a geriatric mother."

20:58.256 --> 20:59.675
- Oh, my gosh.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.468
<i>- I didn't know who</i>
<i>they were talking about.</i>

21:01.551 --> 21:03.136
<i>And then the doctor came in,</i>

21:03.220 --> 21:05.222
I thought "Oh, my God,
they're talking about me."

21:05.305 --> 21:09.267
- Oh, no. Who was it?
I'll kick their ass.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.270
- Okay. So this is
one of my favorite recipes.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.189
<i>The first thing</i>
<i>you're gonna do is cut</i>

21:14.272 --> 21:16.274
some more
of that ginger, ladies.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.402
This one you don't even
have to peel.

21:18.485 --> 21:21.154
Just cut it in, like,
big rough pieces.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.865
And then you're gonna put that
into the water.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.536
And turn the stove on high.
And now you're going to add

21:27.619 --> 21:31.164
about 3 heaping spoons
of chai leaves.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.417
If you want it stronger
you can add more.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.877
And then you're gonna add
four whole cloves to the water.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.295
- Beautiful.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.881
- And 1/2 teaspoon
of cardamom powder.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.383
- Is it cardom?

21:41.466 --> 21:44.594
- Cardema?
- Cardom-ma?

21:44.678 --> 21:46.471
- Cardamom.
[laughs]

21:46.555 --> 21:50.767
And then you're going to add
3 teaspoons of brown sugar.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.478
- [bleep]!
[dog whines]

21:55.647 --> 21:58.400
People always ask me,
"Oh, you do that on purpose?"

21:58.483 --> 22:01.820
and I'm like, "No, that's just
how clumsy I am."

22:01.903 --> 22:04.740
- "That's just me."
- What--what was this again?

22:04.823 --> 22:07.951
- About 3 teaspoons.
And just stir this all up.

22:08.035 --> 22:11.663
So I usually figure
about a teaspoon of sweetener

22:11.747 --> 22:13.165
to a cup of liquid.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.875
So we're making 4 cups of tea.

22:14.958 --> 22:18.462
So along with the brown sugar,
you are going to add

22:18.545 --> 22:19.880
a little bit of honey

22:19.963 --> 22:21.798
about a tablespoon
and just swirl it around.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.592
Just dip it
into the hot liquid.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.801
- Oh, sorry.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.636
Oh, it's pretty hot.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.388
- So once that's starts to boil

22:28.472 --> 22:32.684
which it is doing you wanna
add a cup of milk to this.

22:34.644 --> 22:35.812
- Yum.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.398
- The minute it begins
to rise up,

22:38.482 --> 22:40.484
<i>you want to turn it off.</i>

22:40.567 --> 22:42.652
- Oh, yeah, we can turn it off.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

22:42.736 --> 22:44.988
And then you just wanna get
a little ladle.

22:45.072 --> 22:48.075
- Got a ladle. I got a ladle.
Do you got a ladle?

22:48.158 --> 22:49.367
- Ladle, ladle.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.746
- Oh, yay, you're back.
- Hi.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.290
- Then you want
a little tea strainer.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.375
- I've never in my life
seen that.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.336
- Do you have any
kind of strainer?

22:59.419 --> 23:00.879
- Yes. Is this okay?

23:00.962 --> 23:02.464
<i>- Yeah, that'll work.</i>

23:02.547 --> 23:04.466
<i>Here's what I want you</i>
<i>to do with yours.</i>

23:04.549 --> 23:07.010
Take a ladle--
- Mom.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.637
- Yeah, thank you.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.806
Well, it's a little late now.
I always tell Krishna

23:10.889 --> 23:12.849
she has to put her hair back
when she cooks

23:12.933 --> 23:16.144
because she has such long hair,
I don't want it to catch fire.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.854
- I would do something
like that.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.481
I'm surprised I haven't.

23:19.564 --> 23:22.859
- So you're gonna take a ladle.
Take some of the tea.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.904
And you're just going to
basically strain

23:25.987 --> 23:27.322
the tea into the cup.

23:27.405 --> 23:29.699
- Let's try.
- I don't know how--

23:29.783 --> 23:31.326
- Let's try.

23:31.409 --> 23:35.122
<i>- Just be careful.</i>
- Great, that works.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.124
- Yeah, just be careful
that we don't burn me.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.500
[both laughing]

23:38.583 --> 23:40.418
- "Just be careful that
we don't burn me."

23:40.502 --> 23:41.670
<i>- Oh, my gosh, the dog.</i>

23:41.753 --> 23:43.672
- The dog.
- So cute.

23:43.755 --> 23:47.717
- This is Divina.
Say hi, Divina. Don't be shy.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.387
- Hi. Oh my gosh.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.472
<i>- So cute.</i>
<i>- She's so cute.</i>

23:52.556 --> 23:55.016
- Okay, we're gonna taste
the chai for the first time.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.060
- Okay, be careful.
It'll be hot.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.395
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

23:58.478 --> 24:01.356
- Cheers.
- Ooh.

24:01.439 --> 24:02.941
- Ooh, it's so good.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.151
- Oh, it's really good.

24:04.234 --> 24:05.694
- It's really yummy.
- Wow.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.112
- And it wasn't
that hard to make.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.363
- I really like that.

24:08.446 --> 24:09.781
<i>- Okay, so now we've got</i>
<i>our tea.</i>

24:09.865 --> 24:11.032
Are you ready to plate?

24:11.116 --> 24:12.409
- Yes.
- Oh, yes, I am.

24:12.492 --> 24:15.036
- What you want is the rice
on the side

24:15.120 --> 24:16.580
so you can taste it
on its own.

24:16.663 --> 24:19.249
And then just the shrimp
on the side as well.

24:19.332 --> 24:22.836
- Before we taste it
we have to document it.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.259
"Paige, tell me the news!"

24:29.342 --> 24:30.635
[laughter]

24:30.719 --> 24:32.971
- Tell me the news.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.389
- Should we try it now?

24:34.472 --> 24:37.350
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>So put your utensils down.</i>

24:37.434 --> 24:39.728
Just take your three fingers
and your thumb.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.271
Do not use your pinky.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.481
We're gonna eat with our hands
like we do in India.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.817
- Oh wow, okay.
- Amazing.

24:45.901 --> 24:49.571
- Take a little bit of rice
and push the rice

24:49.654 --> 24:51.573
into the three fingers
like this.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.117
And then you wanna
curve your hand like that

24:54.201 --> 24:56.912
and push the rice
into your mouth

24:56.995 --> 24:59.456
with your thumb like this.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.835
- Ooh, that rice.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.796
- Oh my gosh, that is yummy.
- [laughs]

25:06.880 --> 25:08.590
- I'm gonna try the shrimp.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.383
- Mmm.
- Oh, my gosh.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.094
- I'm not even a big shrimp
person, this is incredible.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.013
- There's so much flavor.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.765
I was wondering
if you could tell us

25:16.848 --> 25:19.601
a little bit about the charity
we're donating to.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.604
- Sure. You're donating
to Shanti Bhavan

25:22.687 --> 25:24.272
<i>which is a school in India</i>

25:24.356 --> 25:26.233
<i>that helps</i>
<i>underprivileged children</i>

25:26.316 --> 25:29.903
<i>have a future by giving them</i>
<i>a full education,</i>

25:29.986 --> 25:33.448
<i>boarding, sports activities,</i>
<i>and the arts.</i>
