WEBVTT

00:01.407 --> 00:04.070
We're engaged. Jenna, you're legit popular.

00:04.078 --> 00:05.778
(Jenna) Popularity was for losers.

00:05.780 --> 00:07.363
I have to earn your forgiveness.

00:07.365 --> 00:09.448
I'm not going anywhere until I do.

00:09.450 --> 00:11.367
- What is that?
- Matty, you're unpopular.

00:11.369 --> 00:13.452
If you want to survive in
the netherworld of the uncool,

00:13.454 --> 00:15.093
you can't think how you used to think.

00:16.187 --> 00:17.354
(Jenna) After I'd ended my brief,

00:17.355 --> 00:19.155
boring foray into popularity land,

00:19.480 --> 00:21.070
I didn't know which me to dress for.

00:21.382 --> 00:23.527
Was I still cool, fun, flirty Jenna,

00:23.529 --> 00:25.425
or was I back to being...

00:25.450 --> 00:27.864
So plain, Jenna.

00:28.390 --> 00:31.100
- It's perfect.
- Uh, perfect for what?

00:31.125 --> 00:33.030
The mother-daughter senior banquet.

00:33.055 --> 00:34.460
Please tell me you're not doing that.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.325
And pass up a chance to imitate you

00:36.327 --> 00:39.412
onstage in front of all the senior girls?

00:39.414 --> 00:42.054
You're right. I... I really shouldn't.

00:42.079 --> 00:43.912
It's... it's cruel.

00:44.765 --> 00:45.785
As if!

00:45.787 --> 00:49.005
I've been waiting for this
day since you were a freshman.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.123
Okay, well, can you at least
choose something else to wear?

00:51.125 --> 00:54.961
But, honey, that hideous hoodie is so you.

00:54.963 --> 00:57.964
- Gee, thanks.
- Okay. Okay.

00:57.966 --> 01:01.548
Which outfit screams,
"I am Jenna Hamilton"?

01:01.696 --> 01:02.835
Damn.

01:03.558 --> 01:05.483
It's not this sexy top, is it?

01:10.812 --> 01:13.946
(Theo) Get your yearbooks,
you sick nostalgia junkies.

01:13.948 --> 01:17.033
You'll notice we've made
a few changes this year.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.618
Sorry, not sorry.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.571
The original version was
bogus social propaganda.

01:21.573 --> 01:23.489
Not to mention boring as [bleep].

01:23.491 --> 01:25.124
Hell, yes. Hell, yes.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.493
Yearbooks are like smack on crack.

01:27.495 --> 01:29.378
Interesting outfit choice, Jenna.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.329
What? I'm mixing it up.

01:30.331 --> 01:33.082
I love that for you. [gasps]

01:33.084 --> 01:37.220
WTF? GTFO!

01:37.222 --> 01:39.555
OMG. FML.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.923
T, are you short-circuiting?

01:40.925 --> 01:43.059
Beavis and Gayhead hijacked our yearbook.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.761
"Most basic" is not a senior superlative.

01:45.763 --> 01:47.763
- Neither is "best bulge."
- Yikes.

01:47.765 --> 01:50.483
Jake and Matty got "most
likely to be bro-mos forever."

01:50.485 --> 01:52.018
Well, Au revoir, the train has left

01:52.020 --> 01:52.985
that friendship station.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.797
Oh, Jenna, look. You got something.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.353
Wait, what? Let me see.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.359
(Jenna voice-over) Considering
how many changes I'd gone through

02:00.361 --> 02:01.944
in the past four years,

02:01.946 --> 02:04.163
I wouldn't be surprised if
I was named "most improved"

02:04.165 --> 02:05.915
or "biggest transformation" or...

02:08.669 --> 02:10.202
"Most depressing"?

02:10.227 --> 02:13.803
Synced and corrected by Chitorafa
www.addic7ed.com

02:15.126 --> 02:16.375
This is BS.

02:16.377 --> 02:19.262
I haven't been Suicide
Girl since sophomore year.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.682
Why would anyone still
think of me as depressing?

02:22.684 --> 02:24.183
Well, there was that one semester where

02:24.185 --> 02:26.102
you ditched all your friends
to hang out with Mary Jane

02:26.104 --> 02:27.520
and that douche, Collin.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.055
Oh, and I guess the low class rank

02:29.057 --> 02:31.057
and the whole "not getting into SCU" thing.

02:31.059 --> 02:33.059
And you're kind of always
in this constant state

02:33.061 --> 02:35.861
of analysis paralysis on your face.

02:35.863 --> 02:37.446
But don't worry, those superlatives

02:37.448 --> 02:38.898
are so false, it's an LOL.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.983
I mean, I got "most likely
to marry a deaf guy,"

02:40.985 --> 02:43.736
which makes no sense, because
Adam has perfect hearing.

02:43.738 --> 02:47.073
Okay, but you aren't
actually going to marry Adam.

02:47.075 --> 02:49.458
Oh, I forgot to tell
you, I changed the date.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.744
- What?
- The breakup date, obvi.

02:51.746 --> 02:53.212
Adam is picking me up from school tomorrow,

02:53.214 --> 02:55.665
and I promz to end the dramz that night.

02:55.667 --> 02:59.251
Jenna, Kyle has a question
he would like to ask you.

02:59.253 --> 03:00.586
Um, hey.

03:00.588 --> 03:01.921
Can you sign my yearbook?

03:01.923 --> 03:04.590
I already wrote the inscription for you.

03:04.592 --> 03:06.475
(Jenna) Dear Kyle, you're a sex god.

03:06.477 --> 03:07.643
Please call me anytime.

03:07.645 --> 03:10.094
Love, Most Depressing.

03:10.773 --> 03:12.250
Sure, Kyle.

03:20.608 --> 03:23.109
Matty, do you maybe
want to sign my yearbook?

03:23.111 --> 03:25.911
Um, only if you maybe want to sign mine.

03:25.913 --> 03:28.080
Hmm.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.249
Come on, Matty, let's go watch some Twitch.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.534
What in the bitch is Twitch?

03:31.536 --> 03:32.952
It's this online thing where you watch

03:32.954 --> 03:35.287
hot girls... uh, you know what?

03:35.289 --> 03:36.539
It's not important.

03:36.541 --> 03:37.957
Pop quiz time.

03:37.959 --> 03:39.959
Matty and Kyle being new BFFs is, A,

03:39.961 --> 03:41.961
an American horror story, B, disturbia,

03:41.963 --> 03:43.732
C, kind of cute, in a sick unnatural way,

03:43.757 --> 03:45.014
or D, all of the above.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.632
(Jenna) What would I
say in Matty's yearbook?

03:46.634 --> 03:48.718
More importantly, what
would he say in mine?

03:48.720 --> 03:50.469
We had so much history together.

03:50.471 --> 03:53.105
Earth to Jenna. Come in, Jenna.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.807
Sorry, what were we talking about?

03:54.809 --> 03:57.417
See, this is why you were
voted most depressing.

04:00.064 --> 04:03.315
Gross, why are there so many
old people at school today?

04:03.317 --> 04:05.985
There's a rehearsal for
the mother-daughter banquet.

04:05.987 --> 04:07.703
[squeals]

04:07.705 --> 04:10.656
I am so excited to see
you be me onstage, Mommy.

04:10.658 --> 04:12.158
Well, I'm terrified.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.243
You know how much I hate
being in the spotlight.

04:14.245 --> 04:17.129
Well, then why do you do
all those plays at church?

04:17.130 --> 04:19.081
God called me to those parts, Lissa.

04:19.083 --> 04:21.634
I couldn't disobey His wishes.

04:21.636 --> 04:22.752
Now, come along.

04:22.754 --> 04:24.553
Hey, beast with a bun!

04:24.555 --> 04:26.055
Ally, what are you doing here?

04:26.057 --> 04:27.506
Are you trying to get Percocet

04:27.508 --> 04:28.891
from the school nurse again?

04:28.893 --> 04:30.676
I think she's onto my games.

04:30.678 --> 04:33.062
I'm here to practice for
that mother-daughter thingy.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.263
Excuse me?

04:34.265 --> 04:37.066
You are not going to be
in the banquet, you slunt.

04:37.068 --> 04:40.653
Oh, I am, and I'm gonna get you so good.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.987
I am so sorry I'm late, sweetie.

04:41.989 --> 04:44.156
Did rehearsal already start?

04:44.158 --> 04:47.811
Darn, looks like your
services are no longer needed.

04:48.362 --> 04:50.329
Fine, I didn't really want to do it anyway.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.941
It's not like I'm getting
an Oscar for this [bleep].

04:54.335 --> 04:56.702
I am so thrilled to be
a part of this, honey.

04:56.704 --> 04:58.954
I've already been working
on an impression of you

04:58.956 --> 05:00.840
that I think you'll adore.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.132
Hard to believe, since
you literally know nothing

05:03.157 --> 05:05.085
about my life, but whatever.

05:05.110 --> 05:06.716
Good luck, Darlene.

05:07.632 --> 05:09.381
You're gonna need it.

05:11.052 --> 05:12.935
Hey, I didn't get to your yearbook yet.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.353
Do you mind if I get
it back to you tomorrow?

05:14.355 --> 05:15.471
Not at all.

05:15.473 --> 05:16.555
I haven't gotten to yours either.

05:16.557 --> 05:18.508
Sweet. I'll see you later.

05:18.893 --> 05:20.726
(Jenna) Matty needing
more time with my yearbook

05:20.728 --> 05:23.062
clearly meant he had a lot to say.

05:23.064 --> 05:25.231
I just hope none of it
involved calling me depressing

05:25.233 --> 05:30.286
or angsty or "that girl with
the analysis-paralysis face."

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.836 --> 05:46.252
- Who did that?
- I don't know.

05:46.254 --> 05:47.920
Maybe you should ask
one of Gabby's friends.

05:47.922 --> 05:50.055
Aren't they your bodyguards now?

05:54.011 --> 05:55.928
This guy bothering you, Matty?

05:55.930 --> 05:57.117
Looks like you're the
one with the bodyguard,

05:57.142 --> 05:58.679
McKibben, not me.

06:01.853 --> 06:03.102
I'm sorry, bro.

06:03.104 --> 06:04.904
I know run-ins with your ex can be awkward.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.773
Me and Jenna? No, we're cool.

06:07.775 --> 06:09.214
I was talking about Jake.

06:09.861 --> 06:11.327
And then she was all,

06:11.329 --> 06:13.579
"Looks like your services
are no longer needed,"

06:13.581 --> 06:15.865
and I'm like, "Oh, I'm so devastated.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.944
Go slip on a [bleep]."

06:18.336 --> 06:19.668
Ixnay on the side-braid.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.269
Little bitch just walked in.

06:21.289 --> 06:22.955
Mom, what are you doing with your hair?

06:22.957 --> 06:24.790
I haven't worn it like that in forever.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.125
Honey, don't stress out.

06:26.127 --> 06:27.343
I'm just trying out some options.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.844
Which reminds me, I need to try out

06:28.846 --> 06:30.296
a new white wine option.

06:30.298 --> 06:33.182
This one tastes like it's
low on alcohol content.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.718
I can feel my body rehydrating.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.133
Not happy.

06:38.556 --> 06:39.772
Ah, the yearbooks are in.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.473
- Let me see.
- Oh, it's dumb.

06:41.475 --> 06:43.976
Theo and Cole took over senior
superlatives, and I got...

06:43.978 --> 06:48.147
"Most depressing." Oh.

06:48.149 --> 06:49.698
But I shouldn't read
too much into it, right?

06:49.700 --> 06:51.150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:51.152 --> 06:52.985
Senior superlatives mean nothing.

06:52.987 --> 06:55.204
I was voted "most likely
not to go to college,"

06:55.206 --> 06:58.991
and look at me now, 20
years later, enrolling.

06:58.993 --> 07:00.626
Joke's on them, right?

07:00.628 --> 07:01.961
Just out of curiosity,

07:01.963 --> 07:03.379
what did... what did Dad get?

07:03.381 --> 07:07.326
"Most likely to become a
father before graduation."

07:07.969 --> 07:10.803
Which is weird, because it was three months

07:10.805 --> 07:12.457
before I got knocked up.

07:12.673 --> 07:14.000
- And Ally?
- [burps]

07:15.142 --> 07:17.309
- "Strongest liver."
- Oh, my God, I'm screwed.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.228
No, you're not. Those
are just flukes, sweetie.

07:19.230 --> 07:22.765
Listen, our high school
quarterback, Trent Simpson,

07:22.767 --> 07:24.733
was the nicest guy ever,

07:24.735 --> 07:27.353
and he was voted "most
likely to end up in prison."

07:27.355 --> 07:30.406
I am so sad Trent Simpson's dead.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.523
He was so hot.

07:31.525 --> 07:32.942
He died? How?

07:32.944 --> 07:34.526
Got shivved in the joint.

07:34.528 --> 07:38.197
This isn't a yearbook. It's a crystal ball.

07:39.969 --> 07:42.430
(Jenna) My mom's yearbook
had me freaking out.

07:42.455 --> 07:44.088
Was high school really
an accurate prediction

07:44.090 --> 07:45.707
of who you'd become?

07:45.709 --> 07:47.208
I wish Val wasn't MIA,

07:47.210 --> 07:50.211
I would've taken any kind
of guidance right now.

07:50.213 --> 07:51.596
♪ It's a good one ♪

07:51.598 --> 07:54.452
♪ So I don't take advice from fools ♪

07:54.477 --> 07:56.655
Thank God you're back,
Val. I have some major...

07:56.680 --> 07:58.304
Hi, Jenna. Can I help you?

07:58.320 --> 08:00.625
Lissa, what are you doing here?

08:00.648 --> 08:02.281
It's a funny story, actually.

08:02.283 --> 08:03.649
I was in Val's office the other day

08:03.651 --> 08:05.150
looking for the key to the equipment closet

08:05.152 --> 08:06.485
when a student came in thinking

08:06.487 --> 08:08.654
I was the new guidance counselor.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.406
I'm no expert, but I'd say

08:10.408 --> 08:12.992
life's way too short to
stay mad at your friend.

08:12.994 --> 08:14.326
When my dad told me he was gay,

08:14.328 --> 08:15.544
I was totally angry at him for lying

08:15.546 --> 08:17.246
to my family, but then I realized

08:17.248 --> 08:19.164
that carrying around bad feelings was gross

08:19.166 --> 08:20.749
and probably giving me premature wrinkles.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.669
So I let it go, and now
I feel so much better.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.837
I know breakups are hard,

08:24.839 --> 08:27.089
but if it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

08:27.091 --> 08:28.307
When I started dating my brother, Tyler,

08:28.309 --> 08:29.758
I thought I was in love with him,

08:29.760 --> 08:31.844
but then we had sex, and
it just didn't feel right,

08:31.846 --> 08:33.345
so we broke up immediately.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.313
Just masturbate. You'll be fine.

08:35.316 --> 08:37.015
So what can I do for you today?

08:37.018 --> 08:38.683
Oh, it's not for me, I was just...

08:38.686 --> 08:39.586
Sit!

08:40.855 --> 08:42.236
It's stupid.

08:42.239 --> 08:44.273
I was named "most
depressing" in the yearbook,

08:44.275 --> 08:47.793
and I'm worried that has some
sort of curse on my future.

08:47.795 --> 08:50.162
Please stop laughing. It's not funny.

08:50.164 --> 08:51.780
Everything in my mom's yearbook came true.

08:51.782 --> 08:54.917
Listen, Jenna, people come

18:59.549 --> 19:00.548
[phone beeps]

19:00.550 --> 19:02.383
Hey, T. Did you end it?

19:02.385 --> 19:05.753
Yep, I ended the play-acting
and ended the game-playing.

19:05.755 --> 19:07.471
This [bleep] is for real!

19:07.473 --> 19:09.423
You accepted a real ring?

19:09.425 --> 19:10.591
Why would you do that?

19:10.593 --> 19:11.892
I panicked, okay?

19:11.894 --> 19:14.178
He just looked so cute and vulnerable

19:14.180 --> 19:15.596
bent down on one knee.

19:15.598 --> 19:17.932
- I couldn't say no.
- This has gone too far.

19:17.934 --> 19:20.151
I know, I'm gonna tell
him the truth tomorrow.

19:20.153 --> 19:22.103
I just wanted to have
one night with this ring.

19:22.105 --> 19:24.071
I mean, hello, it's freaking gorge.

19:24.073 --> 19:26.607
- Look at the carats.
- Hey, Jenna.

19:26.609 --> 19:30.444
Yo, dude, you slayed it out there.

19:30.446 --> 19:34.030
- Yeah.
- You're a freaking murderer.

19:34.834 --> 19:38.452
It's because I'm one
cool chick, right, Matty?

19:38.454 --> 19:39.663
What?

19:40.540 --> 19:42.673
Are you mad at what I
wrote in your yearbook?

19:42.675 --> 19:44.759
No. Of course not.

19:44.761 --> 19:46.210
It was so thoughtful and heartfelt.

19:46.212 --> 19:48.379
I could tell you really
had to dig deep for it.

19:48.381 --> 19:50.419
Oh, come on.

19:51.050 --> 19:52.633
No, Matty, you come on.

19:52.635 --> 19:54.018
After all that we've been through

19:54.020 --> 19:55.936
and I'm still just "one cool chick" to you?

19:55.938 --> 19:57.438
- No, you're...
- What?

19:57.440 --> 19:58.639
A nice hookup?

19:58.641 --> 20:00.558
An expert college essay writer?

20:00.560 --> 20:02.965
An awesome camp counselor, what?

20:03.780 --> 20:05.523
You're my best friend.

20:05.948 --> 20:07.982
But you're also a nice hookup

20:07.984 --> 20:09.150
and a great writer.

20:09.152 --> 20:10.985
You're not the best camp counselor, though.

20:10.987 --> 20:13.704
You're kind of bad at
making arts and crafts.

20:13.706 --> 20:16.407
Please, like you're so great at it.

20:16.409 --> 20:19.326
Gosh, it feels so good to
get out of that side braid.

20:19.328 --> 20:23.164
The pulling, how did you do
that every day for two years?

20:23.166 --> 20:24.458
Are you ready?

20:25.585 --> 20:27.835
See you later, best friend.

20:27.837 --> 20:33.367
♪ We'll try to get it right this time ♪

20:33.392 --> 20:36.677
(Jenna) You want to know the
best part about knowing who I was?

20:36.679 --> 20:38.819
That Matty did too.
