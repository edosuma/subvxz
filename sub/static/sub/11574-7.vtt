WEBVTT

00:07.175 --> 00:08.335
--[KENZ|] Open it.
--[BO] I will.

00:08.426 --> 00:10.712
You better.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.088
I can't.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.795
Come on. Grow a pair.

00:13.890 --> 00:15.596
It could be a trap.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.390
It could be rigged to release
D.N.A.-unscrambling toxins.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.638
Or house some kind of insect
that will breed itself

00:20.730 --> 00:22.846
into a worldwide infestation.

00:22.940 --> 00:27.434
Or it could send Lauren into
the arms of her secret girlfriend.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.393
Same diff.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.570
It's not even really mine to open.

00:31.657 --> 00:34.194
Good point.
Then I say we just get rid of it.

00:34.285 --> 00:35.775
Throw it out. Set it on fire.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.030
--Feed it to a troll. Whatevski.
--Hey!

00:37.121 --> 00:39.828
Hey. That would be
underhanded and selfish and--

00:39.916 --> 00:42.407
None of the things
that you are, my darling.

00:42.501 --> 00:43.877
I could be those things.

00:43.961 --> 00:47.419
Aw, it's good to have
dreams, sweet cheeks.

00:52.887 --> 00:55.003
[MAN 1] Yeah, just give me two
minutes alone with that cop-killer.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.553
[MAN 2] When's he being moved?

00:56.641 --> 01:00.008
[MAN 1] Wouldn't be a bad time
to show him some real justice.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.506
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:18.597 --> 02:21.509
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.512
My love carries a death sentence.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.685
l was lost for years,

02:26.772 --> 02:29.434
searching, while hiding,

02:29.525 --> 02:33.689
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

02:33.779 --> 02:38.648
I won't hide anymore.
|wi|| live the life I choose.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.071
[DYSON] All right, buddy,

02:46.167 --> 02:49.409
let's get Zephyr transferred
out of here and out of our sight.

02:56.761 --> 02:58.797
What did...? Come--

02:58.888 --> 03:02.096
Oh, Officer, where are your pants?

03:07.605 --> 03:09.687
We got bigger problems, Hale.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.315
Hey, check this out.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.652
There.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.776
[HALE] Who is that, Sanders?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.323
Try again.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.784
--Zephyr.
--Uh huh.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.659
Looks like one of these
girls is helping him out.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.786
Whole thing was a set-up.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.742
So, these girls, they come in here,

03:31.837 --> 03:34.579
seduce enough clothing off
our guys to dress Zephyr like a cop

03:34.673 --> 03:36.664
and march him out of here.

03:36.759 --> 03:38.374
|t screams Fae.

03:38.469 --> 03:40.630
Damn right it does.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.680
You know what, it smells like it too,
but it's weird. |t's faint.

03:44.767 --> 03:48.305
What I don't get is why would three
Fae women break out a human killer?

03:48.396 --> 03:50.512
Yeah. And who the hell are they?

03:50.606 --> 03:53.393
More specifically, who the hell is she?

03:54.902 --> 03:56.563
[KENZI] "According to
the disgruntled source,

03:56.654 --> 03:59.862
sexism is to blame for the
security lapse at 39 Division.

03:59.949 --> 04:01.564
The young woman featured
in the leaked footage

04:01.659 --> 04:02.990
helped the accused murderer escape

04:03.077 --> 04:06.240
by flirting with the
male officers present."

04:06.330 --> 04:09.288
My Sheri wouldn't do that.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.865
We're just simple Treefolk.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.042
Well, the girl in the
photo is wearing a mask.

04:13.129 --> 04:14.710
Are you sure it's your daughter?

04:14.797 --> 04:16.753
A mother knows.

04:18.134 --> 04:19.670
Even after ten years.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.752
What happened ten years ago?

04:22.847 --> 04:27.056
She was headstrong. l was stubborn.

04:28.436 --> 04:33.772
I mean, we fought like normal mothers
and daughters do, but this one fight...

04:33.858 --> 04:36.691
She left and she never...

04:38.195 --> 04:42.564
I never heard from her again.
Not a phone call, not a postcard.

04:42.658 --> 04:45.866
And when I saw this on the news...

04:45.953 --> 04:50.071
The Fae in town say you're the best.
That you can find my Sheri.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.406
Not to be a buzzkill,

04:51.500 --> 04:55.539
but this photo op of your
Sheri with Mr. Killer-of-the-Year

04:55.629 --> 04:57.335
--kind of screams guilty.
--Exactly.

04:57.423 --> 05:00.210
The police are going to think
that she's with this monster.

05:00.301 --> 05:04.010
I mean, we mayjust be simple
Treefolk, but I have to protect her.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.087
l'm her mother.

05:07.391 --> 05:11.805
Well, I got to admit, I'm a sucker
for a good mother-daughter reunion.

05:11.896 --> 05:13.602
We'll try and find her.

05:13.689 --> 05:14.895
But if she's working with Zephyr,

05:14.982 --> 05:18.566
we're going to have to turn
this case over to the police.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.028
God bless you.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.943
We'll be in touch.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.778
Simple Treefolk.

05:30.873 --> 05:33.580
She said that, like,
fifty times. You buy it?

05:33.667 --> 05:37.000
When have the Fae ever been straight
with us? I say, "Buyer beware."

05:37.087 --> 05:38.748
And there's the small problemo of

05:38.839 --> 05:41.501
Sheri's last known whereabouts
being on Dyson and Hale's turf.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.629
Which means we have to go digging in
their backyard without them knowing.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.632
Lying, sneakery, killers on the loose--

05:47.723 --> 05:51.181
I'm feeling a distinct
lack of joy for this one.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.850
Zephyr. Zephyr.

05:53.938 --> 05:56.270
--He's Russian, right?
--Yeah.

05:56.357 --> 06:00.270
Oh. Well then, lighten up,
Bo-bop-a-lula.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.101
I got peeps.

06:03.906 --> 06:08.866
[Russian]

06:13.916 --> 06:15.326
I don't know.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.375
Just... find out where he parks his car.

06:18.462 --> 06:21.670
Yes, I know, big favour. I know.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.626
Thank you very much.

06:30.849 --> 06:34.216
Detective, you're telling me after
the woman entered the station,

06:34.311 --> 06:37.018
you remember nothing?

06:37.106 --> 06:43.352
"All I remember is waking up
with a pup tent in my pants."

06:43.445 --> 06:46.187
Why didn't you immediately
take these intruders into custody?

06:46.282 --> 06:49.740
"I thought Ricky sent
them for my birthday."

06:49.827 --> 06:51.863
How about a description
of the woman?

06:51.954 --> 06:57.665
"36-24-28." Yes. Ooh, yeah.

06:57.751 --> 07:01.664
Thank you, Officer Horndog.
Put out an A.P.B. on that right now.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.744
The snitch came through.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.547
We got a twenty on Zephyr's
last known whereabouts. Let's go.

07:05.634 --> 07:06.794
All right.

07:06.885 --> 07:10.298
If this is the right van, you tell
your cousin we owe him a Twinkie.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.654
Oh, Sheri...

07:45.466 --> 07:48.048
[car approaching]

08:15.579 --> 08:17.035
Ew.

08:18.499 --> 08:19.955
Bo?

08:21.210 --> 08:23.246
What?

08:23.337 --> 08:28.206
Oh, yeah, Officers,
I'd like to report a murder.

08:33.931 --> 08:34.795
How are you?

08:34.890 --> 08:37.256
I haven't seen you in a while.
Is that a new haircut?

08:37.351 --> 08:39.967
That's nice. That's cute.
What are you doing here?

08:40.062 --> 08:43.975
Well, it's sort of a funny story
slash coincidence kind of thing.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.182
That's great. I love funny stories.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.107
I'm investigating a
missing persons case.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.026
--What missing person?
--I can't say.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.194
Why?

08:51.281 --> 08:52.987
Client confidentiality.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.157
This guy has nothing to do
with your missing person.

08:55.244 --> 08:57.326
What, with Lefty over
here? No. Hell no.

08:57.413 --> 09:00.405
Hey, the van's empty.

09:00.499 --> 09:02.990
It looks like someone cleaned
out the glove compartment.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.746
Well, I should let you
guys get back to it.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.828
You know, I don't want to
contaminate your crime scene, so.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.458
Good luck, guys.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.012
She is definitely holding out on us.

09:17.099 --> 09:20.887
Yeah? Well, I hope you're wrong, man,
because as nasty as Zephyr was,

09:20.978 --> 09:23.936
whoever did this to him is even nastier.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.980
Looks ritualistic.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.648
Got to get this body to Lauren.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.897
What, do you think the
dancing queen and her chick clique

09:30.988 --> 09:33.149
got together and did this to him?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.026
We got to find her.

09:37.202 --> 09:41.445
Glove compartments are the
boho bags of men, packed with crap

09:41.540 --> 09:43.952
and not nearly the practical
carry-all you hoped for

09:44.042 --> 09:45.953
when you bought it on sale.

09:48.005 --> 09:50.212
Ew! I think I found a rib.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.085
As in human?

09:52.176 --> 09:54.087
As in Memphis dry rub.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.260
If these people are Treefolk,
shouldn't they be, like,

09:56.346 --> 09:58.086
you know, communing with nature?

09:58.182 --> 10:01.674
Making their own granola,
not hanging cop-killers from rafters?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.680
Unless they're not Treefolk at all.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.511
Either way, the cops are
one step behind us

10:05.606 --> 10:07.562
and if Dyson finds out
that I lied to him--

10:07.649 --> 10:09.435
Shh! Shh!

10:11.278 --> 10:14.486
Bo... and Kenzi, right?

10:14.573 --> 10:16.234
--Yeah.
--Hi.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.237
Trick. Your most expensive
bottle of scotch.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.192
What's the occasion?

10:20.287 --> 10:22.323
Closing a business deal in Zurich.

10:22.414 --> 10:26.498
I'm investing in a medical institute
and thought I'd celebrate.

10:26.585 --> 10:29.748
--[TRICK] MacElroy coming up.
--Thanks.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.578
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:31.673 --> 10:32.958
What is she, like, a millionaire?

10:33.050 --> 10:36.087
Multiply that by a couple of thousand
and you'd be right on the money.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.635
She practically ran her
husband's security company.

10:38.722 --> 10:42.260
And now, after he's passed,
she owns it.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.388
So, Dyson's new girlfriend
is a billionaire

10:49.483 --> 10:52.145
and | live in a house with no walls.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.314
Hello.

10:58.408 --> 11:02.651
Get ready for some serious
cheering up, Lady Blah-Blah.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.243
A V.|.P. membership to
Naughty Lady's Gentlemen's Club?

11:07.334 --> 11:08.244
Seriously?

11:08.335 --> 11:09.836
Lest you forget,

11:09.920 --> 11:15.005
our missing minx was last seen
dancing for the boys in blue. Huh?

11:15.092 --> 11:16.832
Come on. It'll be fun.

11:16.927 --> 11:20.670
Lap dances, implants,
strippers. Oh, my!

11:23.684 --> 11:28.223
So, guess which upstanding
officer recently lost his key card?

11:28.313 --> 11:29.814
Boyd,huh?

11:31.066 --> 11:34.229
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.526
Here, check this out.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.104
Does that look like
they know each other?

11:39.199 --> 11:41.030
Yeah.

11:41.118 --> 11:44.827
Something tells me that ain't the
first time he's plucked that g-string.

11:49.167 --> 11:52.000
See? Told you.
Like Vegas for your crotch.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.794
--We're here on a job.
--Sure. Sure.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.248
Ladies, start your va-jay-jays.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.496
Wow.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.829
Who knew? I think
I might actually dig chicks.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.165
Kenzi, be careful.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.295
I think you and all of these guys...

12:41.386 --> 12:43.422
--Sort of hypnotized?
--Yeah.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.765
Yeah, good for us.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.180
I bet the cops were, too.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.098
Yeah, but by who?

12:56.234 --> 13:00.603
By a simple Treefolk with
pastie power and killer moves.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.204
Whew.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.599
Baby, my hair could be
on fire and I would not care.

13:31.687 --> 13:34.144
All there is is what she's selling.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.784
Woo. You don't feel it?

13:49.871 --> 13:52.999
Horny, yes, but not hypnotized.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.574
Her mojo must only work on humans.

13:55.669 --> 13:59.036
She must have cranked it up to eleven
to bust Zephyr out of the cop shop.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.045
She looks so haunted.

14:04.136 --> 14:06.468
Try hunted.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.386
As in for possibly hacking up a dude,

14:08.473 --> 14:10.964
taking a trophy hand,
and hanging him up to dry.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.970
Well, we need to talk to her.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.227
--Kenzi, what are you doing?
--You've got a lap.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.600
She likes to dance.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.307
--Hey.
--[SHER|] Hi.

14:21.611 --> 14:22.600
Hey there, lovely.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.152
Hi.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.237
Um... So, uh...

14:29.327 --> 14:31.818
So, have you worked here long?

14:31.913 --> 14:36.247
Let my body do the talking.
You just sit back and relax.

14:36.334 --> 14:40.202
Wow. You are beautiful...

14:40.297 --> 14:42.879
...and sparkly.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.422
Ow!

14:45.510 --> 14:48.126
You're very talented.

14:48.221 --> 14:51.805
So, what do you do in your off time?

14:51.892 --> 14:53.302
You a cop or something?

14:53.393 --> 14:56.635
Oh, no, Bo, Bo hates cops.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.894
She's just, uh...
She's looking for a job, actually.

15:00.984 --> 15:04.351
Oh. Well, you're going
to want to talk to Lewis.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.648
--[LEW|S] Yes?
--Lady wants to chat.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.325
No problem.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.371
Aren't you a pretty thing?
What can I do to you... for you?

15:16.458 --> 15:20.542
l'm Bo. l was hoping
that you had an opening.

15:20.629 --> 15:23.245
I do and I can see you
headlining in no time.

15:23.340 --> 15:26.252
Of course, there's a price. All the
girls that dance here have to pay it.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.628
You definitely have the currency.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.131
Actually, I was thinking about
something more behind the bar.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.553
Your call.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.724
Beautiful thing like you can only make
my customers happy and me richer.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.438
I can't believe I'm going to
go work for that scum bag.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.106
Yeah, but not for realzies, right?

15:43.193 --> 15:45.400
I mean, you're not actually
going to go back, are you?

15:45.487 --> 15:47.148
Why wouldn't I?

15:47.239 --> 15:49.776
Because our mission,
which we chose to accept,

15:49.866 --> 15:54.200
was to find Donna's daughter.
And we did. Fait accompli.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.744
Yeah, but why did she
help a murderer escape

15:56.832 --> 15:59.369
and then kill him and then
go right back to dancing?

15:59.459 --> 16:02.917
All very good questions
for the popo to answer.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.665
Sheri doesn't have
anyone else in her corner.

16:04.756 --> 16:07.247
lam not turning my back on her.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.797
And that's what makes you you.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.720
You know, I get it, dude.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.476
You know, man wants to cool down,
maybe have some fun,

16:23.567 --> 16:25.432
so he hits the clubs.

16:25.527 --> 16:29.645
Ends up meeting a few girls
he could add to his inventory. Uh?

16:29.739 --> 16:34.904
And just maybe one of those girls sweet
talks him into giving up his key card.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.280
Happens.

16:36.371 --> 16:39.579
But then she uses that key card to get
into the station through the garage.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.951
--Garage?
--Yeah, yeah,

16:41.042 --> 16:43.499
we traced your key card number.

16:43.587 --> 16:45.703
It was used in the garage
right before the big show.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.628
It was a set-up. It must have been.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.458
Or maybe Zephyr brought you in on it.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.419
--Paid you to make it happen.
--No. I swear.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.299
Boyd!

16:55.390 --> 16:57.631
Cop-killer accomplice.
Now let me ask you something.

16:57.726 --> 17:01.389
Is that going to make you a jailhouse
hero, or someone's jailhouse bitch?

17:01.479 --> 17:03.470
Just stop. Just stop.

17:05.734 --> 17:11.354
| go to this place.
Naughty Lady's Gentlemen's Club.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.861
That girl in the photo, Sheri,

17:19.789 --> 17:22.701
Maybe she took my key card.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.919
Cool.

17:25.003 --> 17:28.416
Why don't we just start
with that strip joint address?

17:29.591 --> 17:31.957
So, the Light Fae nuns attacked
the Dark Fae customers

17:32.052 --> 17:34.509
at a charity clothing drive?

17:36.765 --> 17:39.757
Okay. Thanks for getting back to me.

17:39.851 --> 17:43.969
Let me know if anything else
happens, nun-related or otherwise.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.561
Everything okay?

17:52.656 --> 17:54.112
Yes.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.238
How can I help you?

17:56.326 --> 17:59.068
Let's say I know of a
murderer who's been hanged,

17:59.162 --> 18:01.995
his hand has been hacked off
and he's got a real bad haircut.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.538
Any fat removed from his body?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.911
Yeah. He was kind of filleted.

18:08.129 --> 18:12.543
It was gross, Trick. It was disgusting.

18:12.634 --> 18:16.092
Yeah, someone's making
the Hand of Glory.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.885
It isn't what it sounds like, is it?

18:17.973 --> 18:20.555
[TRICK] It's a candle.
A talisman for thieves.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.258
Whoever lights it can
break into anything they want

18:23.353 --> 18:25.014
for as long as the candle stays lit.

18:25.105 --> 18:28.268
Guess it's a good idea
to keep your vault drafty.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.770
The only thing that
extinguishes it is milk.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.852
Of course, milk.

18:33.947 --> 18:37.531
So, this Hand of Glory seems
like every robber's wet dream.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.732
Why doesn't everyone have one?

18:38.827 --> 18:44.367
Well, because the hand retains the
deviant qualities of the original body.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.915
And because making it is a grisly affair.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.083
Hand of what?

18:49.170 --> 18:51.206
A Hand of Glory.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.663
You take the hand of a murderer

18:52.757 --> 18:55.544
who's been recently hanged
by the neck until dead.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.878
You marinate that hand in a mixture
of rare herbs and essential oils.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.759
That serves as a base for the candle.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.932
Any particular kind of candle?

19:04.019 --> 19:07.762
One made from the
murderer's rendered fat.

19:07.856 --> 19:08.936
And the hair?

19:09.024 --> 19:10.389
Used for the wick.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.599
Of course.

19:12.694 --> 19:15.481
But there's something you should
know about this particular hand.

19:15.572 --> 19:19.235
The more vicious the killer,
the stronger the powers of the hand.

19:19.326 --> 19:24.866
Given the Zephyr's history, this is
going to be one powerful talisman.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.412
Okay.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.248
One other thing.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.203
Have you spoken to anybody
else about this case?

19:32.297 --> 19:33.753
Like who?

19:38.303 --> 19:40.043
Thanks for the autopsy.

19:40.138 --> 19:43.346
Dyson. Would you mind if I hang here?

19:43.433 --> 19:48.769
ljust need some personal time
before the guard dog escorts me back.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.141
Take as much time as you need.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.575
[cell phone ringing]

20:04.662 --> 20:05.617
Hello?

20:05.705 --> 20:08.037
--[LAUREN] Bo?
--Hey.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.160
Hey, Lauren.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.742
I've been thinking about you.

20:12.837 --> 20:13.792
What's going on?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.245
Something's come up.

20:15.340 --> 20:19.128
l was just consulting with Dyson
about the Russian strangler case.

20:19.219 --> 20:22.803
He wanted to know if I had
talked to anyone about it.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.299
I think he meant you.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.347
Oh. Yeah.

20:26.434 --> 20:30.393
Yeah, we're working the
same case, just different angles.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.812
--Is that all?
--Actually, no.

20:32.899 --> 20:36.187
The corpse of this Zephyr
guy is missing a hand.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.608
We think it's going
to be used to make--

20:37.695 --> 20:40.027
The Hand of Glory, yeah.

20:40.115 --> 20:44.233
--So, you know?
--Yeah. Was that it?

20:44.327 --> 20:45.828
Well, it's a little bit awkward, but--

20:45.912 --> 20:48.699
No. No, go ahead.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.075
Have you had any luck

20:50.166 --> 20:54.535
getting the so-called
solution to my predicament?

20:57.340 --> 21:01.549
All I ended up with
was a lot of questions.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.592
Was there something else
that you wanted to tell me?

21:03.680 --> 21:06.262
No.

21:06.349 --> 21:07.304
Are you all right?

21:07.392 --> 21:10.680
Yeah. I'm fine. Bye.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.605
How did you know?

21:23.700 --> 21:28.319
After that last sleazoid I saw you
grinding on, even I needed a drink.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.947
Yeah, well, after Lewis
raised the entry fees,

21:32.041 --> 21:34.293
l have to make it up somewhere.

21:34.377 --> 21:37.869
Why not just score a gig
at another strip joint?

21:37.964 --> 21:41.502
Actually, I was planning on
leaving the business completely.

21:41.593 --> 21:42.708
Starting something of my own.

21:42.802 --> 21:46.966
That's great. Probably got to
raise a lot of cash for that.

21:47.056 --> 21:49.388
What are you planning
on doing, robbing a bank?

21:49.476 --> 21:51.637
Yeah.

21:51.728 --> 21:55.971
Up next, the shimmering
seductions of Sheri.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.521
Gotta go.

22:01.279 --> 22:04.988
What can I get you guys?

22:05.074 --> 22:07.907
Beer? Scotch?

22:07.994 --> 22:09.950
We have a special on body shots.

22:18.546 --> 22:22.664
So, what is this, another funny story
slash coincidence kind of thing?

22:22.759 --> 22:23.839
'Cause you better have
a damn good reason

22:23.927 --> 22:25.792
for interfering in my investigation.

22:25.887 --> 22:28.503
Two G&Ts coming up, guys.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.259
Will you keep it down?
You're going to blow my cover.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.341
You told me you were
on a missing persons case.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.391
l was. lam.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.686
Show some love for your headliner

22:36.773 --> 22:41.642
putting some motion
in your ocean, Sheri.

22:41.736 --> 22:46.321
Looks like Bo's missing persons
case is our missing persons case.

22:48.243 --> 22:49.779
You knew where she
was the whole time?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.860
l was going to tell you.

22:51.955 --> 22:54.492
--We got someone to take in.
--Okay. No, Dyson, wait.

22:54.582 --> 22:57.665
I know Sheri is in trouble.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.743
But if you arrest her now,
we're never going to find out

22:59.837 --> 23:01.543
why she made the Hand of Glory.

23:01.631 --> 23:03.747
We'll get it out of her. It's what we do.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.672
Okay. Okay, how about this--

23:05.760 --> 23:11.676
| stay undercover, | snoop around,
I keep you guys in the loop.

23:11.766 --> 23:15.384
Come on, Dyson.
You need me on the inside.

23:15.478 --> 23:17.139
I need you?

23:17.230 --> 23:19.562
You've been lying to me.
I don't even know if I can trust you.

23:19.649 --> 23:22.516
On this, you can.

23:22.610 --> 23:26.979
Something big is going down
here, and I can find out what it is.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.483
Then you're going to
tell us everything?

23:28.575 --> 23:30.031
Yes.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.240
You be careful.

23:58.479 --> 24:01.141
Wow. Someone really likes fish.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.991
What the hell are you doing in here?

24:56.079 --> 25:00.994
l was just admiring
your amazing trophies.

25:01.084 --> 25:03.370
When I was little, my dad
used to take me fishing,

25:03.461 --> 25:06.373
but we never reeled in
anything this impressive.

25:08.383 --> 25:10.669
Not many women
appreciate my collection.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.920
Well, that's because
they don't have a clue

25:12.011 --> 25:15.128
what it takes to reel in
a marlin or a sailfish.

25:15.223 --> 25:16.804
Or a hammerhead.

25:16.891 --> 25:19.303
I had to wrestle that for five hours.

25:19.394 --> 25:22.352
Almost got away twice.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.349
That one | baited with my best lure.

25:24.440 --> 25:28.024
You know, I had to put on a
real show for her. You know.

25:28.111 --> 25:31.524
This one practically
jumped into my arms.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.491
You know, each catch has its own story.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.953
And I would love to hear them all,

25:41.040 --> 25:45.409
but I left a couple of
customers dry at the bar.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.459
And if they don't get
their Singapore Slings,

25:47.547 --> 25:49.663
they're going to be really grouchy.

25:54.178 --> 25:57.215
You want me to blow up
a picture of an invisible safe?

25:57.306 --> 26:01.390
Not entirely invisible.
It was sort of shimmery.

26:01.477 --> 26:04.685
Shimmery. So, you mean,
kind of there but not there?

26:04.772 --> 26:06.808
Exactly.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.811
Oh, wait a minute.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.642
Okay, here she comes.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.603
Oh, wow. I haven't seen
one of these in years.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.359
--What is it?
--A holographic safe

26:15.450 --> 26:17.486
made by the Nibelung dwarves.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.613
They're the best
metalsmiths in the world.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.114
They somehow found
a way to bind iron

26:21.205 --> 26:22.911
so it can exist between
two dimensions.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.991
Yep. Nobody gets in one of these, ever.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.667
Unless you have the
Hand of Glory to help you out.

26:28.755 --> 26:32.122
[cell phone ringing]

26:32.216 --> 26:34.468
Fingerprint results from
Lewis' scotch glass are in.

26:34.552 --> 26:36.167
And?

26:36.262 --> 26:39.299
His real name is Kobe Ah Ket.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.803
He's Dark Fae. A Bunyip.

26:42.894 --> 26:45.931
One of those water spirits who
gets off on abducting women.

26:46.022 --> 26:47.353
That sounds about right.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.852
I say we nab his watery,
miscreant ass now.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.810
No. There is something in
that safe that Sheri needs.

26:53.905 --> 26:55.941
And if Lewis is the only
one with access to it,

26:56.032 --> 26:57.738
there's a good chance
she'll never get it.

26:57.825 --> 27:00.032
What aren't you telling us, Bo?

27:00.119 --> 27:02.952
I know how to figure out
what Sheri wants to steal.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.866
Okay. You've got 'til noon tomorrow.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.666
Not one SGCOhd more.

27:15.009 --> 27:18.251
You have to tell us what
Sheri wants to steal.

27:18.346 --> 27:20.177
What have I done?

27:20.264 --> 27:22.471
Even if I did see her,
she'd probably never forgive me.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.173
I think she would.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.054
And you know why I think that?

27:26.145 --> 27:28.101
Because I would forgive my mom.

27:28.189 --> 27:31.477
--You're a runaway?
--Yeah. Still am, I guess.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.944
Turns out the whole
stepdad thing wasn't for me.

27:34.028 --> 27:37.612
I told my mom to choose and she did.

27:37.698 --> 27:40.280
Sheri probably thinks
I chose my husband over her.

27:40.368 --> 27:44.031
Well, you'll never know what she
thinks unless you tell us the truth.

27:44.121 --> 27:47.739
You are not Treefolk, are you?

27:49.460 --> 27:52.452
No, we're Selkies.

27:52.547 --> 27:54.412
That's, like, some kind
of mermaid, right?

27:54.507 --> 27:56.793
More like seal shifters.

27:56.884 --> 28:00.251
Yeah. Years ago, I fell
in love with a fisherman,

28:02.014 --> 28:04.426
and I gave away my
pelt to be with him.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.509
But I thought that Fae couldn't
mate with humans, legally speaking.

28:07.603 --> 28:11.346
Well, Selkies, we're a bit of a grey area.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.647
Once we remove our pelts,
we're mostly human.

28:13.734 --> 28:17.192
Except for your
super-seductive snatch power.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.020
So, was Sheri's father human?

28:19.115 --> 28:23.404
No, the fisherman isn't her father.
I was pregnant when I met him.

28:24.745 --> 28:27.953
And when Sheri was born, I...

28:28.040 --> 28:29.621
...I hid her pelt away, as well.

28:29.709 --> 28:33.327
Well, didn't she want it
growing up? Didn't she miss it?

28:36.883 --> 28:40.751
You never told Sheri
she was a Selkie, did you?

28:40.845 --> 28:42.301
No.

28:43.639 --> 28:47.348
When she was fifteen, she...

28:47.435 --> 28:49.096
...she found her pelt.

28:49.186 --> 28:52.394
Which triggered the great
mother-daughter crap storm of 2002.

28:52.481 --> 28:55.894
Donna, what happens if
you don't have your pelt?

28:57.403 --> 29:01.066
You can't ever go back to the sea.

29:01.157 --> 29:02.613
Ever.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.376
[BO] Sheri.

29:19.467 --> 29:20.502
Club's not open yet.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.504
So, why are you here?

29:25.056 --> 29:27.968
This is about your pelt, isn't it?

29:28.059 --> 29:31.551
Lewis stole it from you and you plan to
use the Hand of Glory to get it back.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.932
Okay. Who are you really?

29:34.023 --> 29:37.060
Your mother hired me to help you.

29:37.151 --> 29:41.565
Look, you can either
deal with me or the cops.

29:41.656 --> 29:45.240
But I'm not the one who's going to try
to bring you in for Zephyr's murder.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.574
Zephyr used to come
in here and get drunk.

29:50.665 --> 29:53.452
He beat up Crystal once really bad.

29:53.542 --> 29:57.660
When he was arrested and
we found out he was a killer,

29:57.755 --> 29:59.791
I did what I had to do
to save me and my sisters.

29:59.882 --> 30:02.589
Wait, all the girls here are Selkies?

30:05.304 --> 30:08.046
So, how did you end up here?

30:09.850 --> 30:11.681
We had plans.

30:11.769 --> 30:14.761
We had plans to buy this
little beachside hotel and bar.

30:14.855 --> 30:18.268
You know, someplace where we could
visit the water whenever we wanted.

30:18.359 --> 30:20.896
--It took money.
--So, that's where Lewis came in.

30:20.987 --> 30:24.525
Yeah. Stupid Bunyip tricked us.

30:24.615 --> 30:27.857
He said he had an investor friend
and that we should turn human

30:27.952 --> 30:29.442
and use our charms on the guy.

30:29.537 --> 30:32.700
But there was no investor.

30:32.790 --> 30:36.328
Lewis stole our skins.

30:36.419 --> 30:41.209
And he promised us that if we danced
for a year, he would give them back.

30:41.298 --> 30:42.913
But he didn't.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.842
So, you finally decided to take
matters into your own hands...

30:45.928 --> 30:48.419
...or hand, as it were.

30:48.514 --> 30:49.469
Yeah.

30:49.557 --> 30:54.017
All we needed was a murderer, a dumb
cop, and a way to get into the station.

30:54.103 --> 30:56.469
I guess you know the rest.

30:56.564 --> 31:01.024
Look, what I want to know...

31:01.110 --> 31:03.146
...is what are you going to do about it?

31:03.237 --> 31:05.774
Like I said,

31:05.865 --> 31:08.402
your mother hired me to help you.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.664
So, whoever lights it pulls off the theft.

31:17.752 --> 31:18.867
And no one can stop them.

31:18.961 --> 31:20.622
And then you'll come with
me to see your mother?

31:20.713 --> 31:21.828
Did she really send you?

31:21.922 --> 31:26.165
She loves you. She just wants
a chance to talk to you again.

31:29.430 --> 31:31.512
What is this, a knitting club?

31:31.599 --> 31:33.305
Uh... Group warm-up. We're good.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.008
Well, I'm not. My back
door's busted open.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.968
Someone tell me what's going on here.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.725
Now.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.897
--Nobody move!
--What the hell?

31:41.984 --> 31:43.770
Dyson, you said we had until noon.

31:43.861 --> 31:47.069
Not one second more.
Hale, you got him?

31:47.156 --> 31:48.646
Grab on.

32:02.296 --> 32:03.752
Come on.

32:08.344 --> 32:09.959
Let's go.

32:10.054 --> 32:12.420
[SHERl] Looks like no
one's going to stop us.

32:12.515 --> 32:15.427
[BO] That hand is even
better than advertised.

32:21.941 --> 32:24.933
Okay, Hand of Glory, check.

32:25.027 --> 32:26.892
Frozen people, check.

32:26.987 --> 32:30.195
Weird, impenetrable,
holographic safe, check.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.783
Now what?

32:41.669 --> 32:42.875
It's supposed to work.

32:42.962 --> 32:45.544
Okay, so we're winging it.
We can do that.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.212
Maybe the hand knows what to do.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.755
Okay.

33:17.079 --> 33:18.535
Atta boy.

33:24.879 --> 33:25.994
Oh, thank you.

33:26.088 --> 33:28.124
Come on. Let's grab
the rest and get out of here.

33:28.215 --> 33:29.671
Okay.

33:53.157 --> 33:56.274
Bo. Bo!

33:56.368 --> 33:59.531
Oh my god, our pelts! Oh my god.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.571
--Get your hands off those pelts.
--Hey.

34:02.666 --> 34:05.874
--Hey, they belong to me.
--No, they don't. Turn around.

34:08.255 --> 34:11.042
--Hale, get him out of here.
--Gotcha.

34:11.133 --> 34:14.591
[LEWIS] Those are mine.
You girls all owe me!

34:14.678 --> 34:17.420
You're free. You're all free.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.220
Not quite.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.678
Miss, you're going to
need to come with me.

34:22.770 --> 34:24.306
Dyson, please.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.682
Sheri saved these women
from virtual slavery.

34:26.774 --> 34:28.310
Look at them.

34:29.485 --> 34:33.069
Bo, Zephyr's murder was very public.

34:33.155 --> 34:35.612
Very sloppy and one hell of a mess.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.690
The Ash is going to want
someone to answer for that.

34:37.785 --> 34:39.946
Who says he ever
even has to find out?

34:40.037 --> 34:42.403
You're suggesting that l conceal this?

34:42.498 --> 34:45.205
Tell me, what's going
to happen to Lewis?

34:45.292 --> 34:47.328
Either from the Light or the Dark,
he'll get what's coming to him.

34:47.419 --> 34:50.286
And that will be justice.
Because Lewis is scum.

34:50.381 --> 34:52.667
Sheri, she saved these
women from servitude.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.965
She deserves to be free.

34:56.053 --> 34:58.169
Our pelts are who we are.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.880
To have something so
special taken from you,

35:00.975 --> 35:03.808
do you have any idea
how that would feel?

35:10.067 --> 35:13.025
Then you and l, we've
got some work to do.

35:13.112 --> 35:17.651
We've got to get Zephyr's body from
Lauren and create a new crime scene.

35:17.741 --> 35:20.118
--Thank you.
--Alright.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.034
Thank you.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.659
Thank you so much.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.466
[phone ringing]

35:37.553 --> 35:38.793
Hello?

35:38.887 --> 35:41.299
Again?

35:41.390 --> 35:43.551
How many were hurt?

35:43.642 --> 35:46.679
Okay. Thanks.

35:59.116 --> 36:01.323
This is Fitzpatrick MacCorieghan.

36:01.410 --> 36:05.449
I'd like to speak to Lauren
if the Ash will allow.

36:05.539 --> 36:09.202
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
It was selfish what I did.

36:09.293 --> 36:11.705
Yeah, it was.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.501
And I should have told
you what you really were,

36:13.589 --> 36:15.625
but I was afraid of what might happen.

36:15.716 --> 36:17.456
I know you did it to protect me.

36:17.551 --> 36:21.260
I realized that after I ran away,
but I couldn't come back.

36:21.347 --> 36:25.181
You got your stubbornness
from me and your pride.

36:25.267 --> 36:28.009
It's what I needed to
free me and my friends.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.560
So, we're okay?

36:30.647 --> 36:32.103
Yeah.

36:33.484 --> 36:35.349
Thanks to this one here.

36:35.444 --> 36:38.356
Hey, all I did was bartend a little.

36:38.447 --> 36:40.187
I know what you did for me.

36:40.282 --> 36:43.365
Without you, I would be
stuck on dry land forever.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.121
I better get going.

36:50.209 --> 36:51.415
Are you sure about this?

36:51.502 --> 36:56.041
Yeah, I'm sure.
The water is where I belong.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.713
But I'll visit often, I promise.

36:58.801 --> 37:02.043
Okay, but once you and your
friends open up the bar, you call me.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.173
And you watch out for those storms.

37:04.264 --> 37:06.095
And you look after each other, okay.

37:06.183 --> 37:07.764
And don't take your
pelt off for just anyone.

37:07.851 --> 37:11.093
Hey, Mom. I'll be fine.

37:51.645 --> 37:55.103
It's still heartbreaking
watching her walk away from me.

38:31.310 --> 38:32.641
[cell phone ringing]

38:32.728 --> 38:34.389
Don't you dare.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.892
It might be important.

38:36.982 --> 38:40.395
All of your calls are important.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.977
Well, I'm a very powerful woman.

38:43.071 --> 38:45.232
l have a soft side, as well.

38:47.534 --> 38:49.525
I noticed.

38:49.620 --> 38:52.202
Thank you for the painting.

38:52.289 --> 38:55.452
Isn't it lovely? I picked it up yesterday.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.043
You don't have to buy me things.

38:57.127 --> 39:00.665
I know. I bought it for me.

39:00.756 --> 39:03.748
Turns out I don't have to travel
to Zurich as much as I thought.

39:05.177 --> 39:07.543
Not with video conferencing.

39:13.185 --> 39:17.224
I might as well have
something pretty to look at.

39:17.314 --> 39:19.896
I'm not pretty enough?

39:19.983 --> 39:21.769
Oh, and I ordered a throw rug.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.727
Because, as you pointed
out so delicately last night,

39:24.821 --> 39:28.234
my toes are icicles of pain.

39:30.536 --> 39:32.447
Enough talk.

39:38.752 --> 39:39.582
About a week ago,

39:39.670 --> 39:43.504
I noticed an escalation in hostility
between the Light and the Dark.

39:43.590 --> 39:46.423
And like the nuns you mentioned,
it's always unprovoked.

39:46.510 --> 39:49.843
Yes. Have you come across
anything that might cause this?

39:49.930 --> 39:53.843
Nothing that would trigger
the blind rage that you describe.

39:55.811 --> 39:59.053
--|'|| do some research.
--|'d appreciate that.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.012
And thanks for coming
down on such short notice.

40:01.108 --> 40:04.350
Are you kidding?
These calls are like field trips.

40:04.444 --> 40:06.275
Out here, it's the real world.

40:06.363 --> 40:11.699
In my lab, it's petri dishes and
infectious disease smears and--

40:11.785 --> 40:13.867
Blocked phone numbers?

40:14.913 --> 40:16.653
Something like that.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.284
Can we talk?

40:19.668 --> 40:21.624
Oh, come on, buddy, five minutes.

40:21.712 --> 40:23.873
Let me buy you a beer, friend.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.131
I owe you an apology.

40:36.226 --> 40:40.094
--No, you don't.
--I was angry with you

40:40.188 --> 40:43.521
and it was unfair.

40:43.609 --> 40:46.567
But it was only in reaction
to you being unfair, as well.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.109
Me?

40:52.909 --> 40:55.286
The Morrigan gave me that.

40:56.705 --> 41:02.792
She says it's the key to
saving Nadia, your girlfriend.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.293
--Oh.
--Oh.

41:08.383 --> 41:11.090
Actually, I'm relieved.

41:13.096 --> 41:17.430
It's been killing me not telling you.

41:17.517 --> 41:20.099
But how do you turn to someone
that you care about and say,

41:20.187 --> 41:24.100
"Oh, by the way, I have a girlfriend.
And she's lying in a coma"?

41:24.191 --> 41:26.853
She's in a coma?

41:26.943 --> 41:28.649
For how long?

41:28.737 --> 41:31.729
Five years.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.609
Because of me.

41:35.911 --> 41:38.448
Tell me.

41:38.538 --> 41:42.451
I was in the Congo on a research grant.

41:42.542 --> 41:49.129
Nadia was with me taking pictures
of refugees for a magazine.

41:49.216 --> 41:53.380
I had promised her
this grand adventure.

41:57.099 --> 42:01.468
Five months in, an illness swept
through neighbouring villages,

42:01.561 --> 42:07.682
very sudden, very deadly,
and I went to help.

42:07.776 --> 42:11.439
It turns out that the people
being affected by the outbreak

42:11.530 --> 42:16.194
weren't people at all. They were Fae.

42:16.284 --> 42:19.776
That's when you
learned about the Fae?

42:19.871 --> 42:24.490
Nadia became terribly ill.

42:24.584 --> 42:27.417
She was the only human to get sick.

42:29.339 --> 42:34.754
The old Ash was there at the time
and he offered me all of his resources

42:34.845 --> 42:37.177
to help find a cure for her.

42:39.349 --> 42:41.385
But in exchange for--

42:41.476 --> 42:44.138
Your complete servitude.

42:47.023 --> 42:49.890
Well...

42:49.985 --> 42:54.274
...this could be the cure for Nadia.

42:54.364 --> 42:57.606
It would change everything.

42:59.953 --> 43:01.989
You haven't opened it.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.537
I thought we should do that together.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.555
What the hell is that supposed to be?

43:27.773 --> 43:29.729
I have no idea.
