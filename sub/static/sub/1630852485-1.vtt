ANNOUNCER: "9-1-1: Lone
Star" all new Mondays.

00:07.485 --> 00:08.704
9-1-1, what is your emergency?

00:08.878 --> 00:10.314
ANNOUNCER: And watch
other Fox Shows,

00:10.488 --> 00:13.752

and "The Resident" on Fox.

CHIEF BOWMAN:
Please state your full name
and rank for the record.

00:25.329 --> 00:28.115
Owen Marshall Strand.
Captain, 126.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.379
CHIEF BOWMAN:
I'll remind you, Captain,

00:31.509 --> 00:33.555
that you are entitled
to have a union rep

00:33.685 --> 00:35.078
present for these proceedings.

00:35.165 --> 00:37.950
I'm not here
to hide behind anybody.

00:37.994 --> 00:41.345
Well, frankly, I'm disappointed
that you're here at all.

00:41.389 --> 00:44.870
Regarding the events
of last week, May 24th...

00:46.916 --> 00:48.787
do you deny that you struck

00:48.918 --> 00:51.529
a superior officer
without provocation?

00:51.573 --> 00:54.097
I deny it was
without provocation,

00:54.184 --> 00:57.405
and I'm not so sure
I would use the word "superior."

00:57.535 --> 01:00.582
Deputy Chief Tyson was not yet
deputy chief when it struck him.

01:00.712 --> 01:04.325
And as for provocation,
he used his influence

01:04.412 --> 01:07.415
to shutter my firehouse
over a personal grudge.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.504
All due respect,
that's a bunch of bull

01:09.547 --> 01:10.809
and Captain Strand knows it.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.550
What I do know, Billy,
is that you've always

01:12.681 --> 01:14.117
wanted to captain the 126.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.640
It's like an obsession with you.

01:15.684 --> 01:17.338
And when you couldn't have her,
like a scorned lover

01:17.468 --> 01:18.991
you made sure that
nobody else could either.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.645
I would just remind
Captain Strand

01:20.776 --> 01:24.780
that the decision to not reopen
the 126 was not personal.

01:24.910 --> 01:27.783
It's about the budget.
And numbers.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.480
Numbers you yourself
put together.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.700
So if you would like to
blame anybody, blame yourself.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.006
And yet, I blame you.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.139
CHIEF BOWMAN: Gentlemen,
the purpose of this hearing

01:36.226 --> 01:39.011
is to decide what, if any,
disciplinary action

01:39.055 --> 01:41.275
will be taken
against Captain Strand

01:41.405 --> 01:44.016
for his assault
on Deputy Chief Tyson.

01:44.147 --> 01:47.368
This is not about
the fate of the 126.

01:47.498 --> 01:49.370
Well, it damn well should be.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.981
Suspend me, fire me,
clap me in irons.

01:52.024 --> 01:54.157
What happens to me
isn't important.

01:54.288 --> 01:56.551
What matters is the 126

01:56.594 --> 01:57.595
and the people who comprise it,

01:57.639 --> 01:58.988
people who've
uprooted their lives

01:59.031 --> 02:00.468
to serve this city.

02:00.511 --> 02:03.645
And have done so
in exemplary fashion.

02:03.775 --> 02:07.039
You're not just
closing a firehouse,

02:07.083 --> 02:09.651
you're breaking up a family.

02:09.694 --> 02:14.003
So I am here
to respectfully ask
for another chance

02:14.046 --> 02:16.658
for some more time
to audit the books.

02:16.701 --> 02:19.400
I'm confident
that I can find a way
to keep the house open.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.320
What?

02:27.625 --> 02:28.844
TOMMY:
How bad is it?

02:28.887 --> 02:30.019
-Not great.
-Did they can you?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.978
-Suspended.
-For how long?

02:33.065 --> 02:35.285
-Unclear.
-What about us?

02:35.416 --> 02:37.200
For the time being,
they'd like you to stay

02:37.287 --> 02:39.855
in your temporary assignments
permanently.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.465
Permanently?
I-I don't understand.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.772
So they're really not gonna
reopen the 126th?

02:43.859 --> 02:45.208
Not only are they not opening,

02:45.295 --> 02:47.079
but they've red-tagged
the building for demolition.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.690
-They're tearing it down.
-They can't do that.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.822
They're the city.
They can do whatever they want.

02:50.866 --> 02:53.347
MATEO: Wow.
So it's really over then.

02:53.477 --> 02:55.305
You kidding me?
This isn't the end.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.829
This isn't even the beginning
of the end.

02:57.873 --> 03:00.310
-Is it the middle?
-They knock us down seven times,

03:00.354 --> 03:02.530
-we get back up eight.
-That's right.

03:02.573 --> 03:05.533
The 126 is our home.
We built it together,

03:05.663 --> 03:07.578
we're gonna fight for it
together, like a family.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.101
-As a family.
-That's right, Captain.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.929
These people have zero idea

03:11.060 --> 03:11.843
who they are up against.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.845
No, they really don't.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.891
So we fight,
we're gonna keep fighting.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.458
And we never give up...

breaking the law now.

We are not.

to the hospital?

Did we miss something?

No. No, no. You called it.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.319
She's fine.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.669
In fact, she sent
snickerdoodles.

But did it, though?

to avoid administering

06:13.416 --> 06:15.853

en route to the hospital.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.420

We're not some municipal service

that come with it.

If that's not a fit for you,
I get it.

But you need to understand

you're not at

to have this conversation again.

07:47.118 --> 07:50.165
if you're gonna have a 126 hang,

07:50.208 --> 07:52.210
it should be exclusive
to the 126 crew.

JUDD:
Yeah, that makes sense.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.842
Hey, hey, hey.

38:42.885 --> 38:45.540
It looks kinda like Elsa
from Frozen,her palace.

38:45.584 --> 38:46.759
Yo, man, you watched Frozen?

38:46.802 --> 38:49.196
'Cause I got a daughter
on the way.

38:49.239 --> 38:51.459
-Somebody's still inside.
-Wait, what?

38:51.590 --> 38:54.070
-A teenage volunteer,
Lindsey Robertson.
-No, they had a list.

38:54.114 --> 38:56.595
No, she-she was the one
keeping the list.
She didn't count herself.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.077
How much water you think
we put on that fire?

39:01.208 --> 39:02.557
Twenty-five hundred gallons,
I reckon.

39:02.601 --> 39:05.038
At 8.35 pounds per gallon,
that's like...

39:05.081 --> 39:06.561
Ten tons of
additional water weight

39:06.605 --> 39:07.780
hanging over that kid's head.

39:07.823 --> 39:09.085
If we send a team in,

39:09.216 --> 39:11.305
could be looking at
a secondary collapse any moment.

39:11.436 --> 39:14.003
That assumes she survived
the first collapse.

39:14.134 --> 39:17.355
♪

39:24.449 --> 39:27.452
A sense of shock here at
Providence Pasture Church,

39:27.495 --> 39:29.889
where a teenager
is still trapped inside

39:30.019 --> 39:31.325
a collapsed gymnasium.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.545
Firefighters are preparing
a rescue effort,

39:33.632 --> 39:36.722
but with an estimated
20,000 pounds of ice

39:36.852 --> 39:38.463
enveloping the already
unstable structure,

39:38.593 --> 39:41.466

are dire.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.208
Now, Strickland, you scouted

39:45.295 --> 39:46.775
the double doors
on the alpha side, right?

39:46.906 --> 39:48.473
Yeah, from what I can tell
they're uncompromised,

39:48.516 --> 39:49.212
if we chop some of that ice off.

39:49.256 --> 39:51.476
Hey, I use that circular saw

39:51.519 --> 39:52.781
and then we can just
crib our way in.

39:52.868 --> 39:54.304
Good. We'll make
entry from there,

39:54.435 --> 39:56.045
begin a slow, deliberate search

39:56.089 --> 39:57.743
through all discovered
void spaces.

39:57.786 --> 39:59.658

any signs of life.

40:03.096 --> 40:05.707
You feel it start to go,
get outta there ASAP.

40:05.751 --> 40:08.449
That's right. Anybody doesn't
feel confident going in,

40:08.580 --> 40:09.494
just speak up.

40:09.624 --> 40:12.453
-No judgment.
-CARLOS: Sorry to interrupt.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.803
These are Lindsey's parents,
hoping for a word.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.109
Of course, yeah.

40:16.239 --> 40:18.372
We wanna say
thank you for, um...

Oh God, please just
save our little girl.

40:22.898 --> 40:24.944

everything we can, okay?

40:25.074 --> 40:27.512
