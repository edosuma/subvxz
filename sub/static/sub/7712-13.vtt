00:11.357 --> 00:13.328
TODAY I'M HEADED OVER

00:13.361 --> 00:17.168

OH, MY GOD, DARRYL.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.154
YOU LOOK LIKE
BARACK OBAMA.

00:26.186 --> 00:27.688
EVERYBODY, I'M DATING
BARACK OBAMA.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.326
WHY ARE YOU
DRESSED LIKE THAT?
LIKE WHAT?

00:29.360 --> 00:31.530
LIKE YOU'RE APPLYING
FOR A LOAN.

00:31.564 --> 00:33.867
MAYBE HE'S GOING TO CHURCH.
OR COURT.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.538
FIGURED

00:35.572 --> 00:37.808

THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:39.747 --> 00:41.717
OKAY. HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO.

00:41.751 --> 00:44.389
I'M GOING TO INSTRUCT THE KIDS
ABOUT MANAGEMENT AND SALES.

00:44.422 --> 00:46.526
OSCAR WILL BE
IN CHARGE OF ACCOUNTING.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.200
PAM WILL BE EYE CANDY.

00:49.233 --> 00:52.373
NO, AND ALSO BECAUSE
THAT IS YOUR ALMA MATER.

00:52.405 --> 00:55.245
DARRYL WILL HIRE SOME KIDS
FOR THE WAREHOUSE.

00:55.279 --> 00:57.448
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT INTERNSHIPS WITH THEM

00:57.482 --> 00:59.687
BECAUSE THEY DEFINITELY
AIN'T GOIN' TO COLLEGE.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.757
WHAT COLLEGE
DID YOU GO TO, MIKE?

01:01.791 --> 01:02.859
LET'S GO!

01:02.892 --> 01:05.864
[cheerful music]

01:05.899 --> 01:13.914

01:35.924 --> 01:37.562
TODAY I AM MEETING
A POTENTIAL CLIENT

01:37.595 --> 01:39.267
ON THE GOLF COURSE

01:39.300 --> 01:41.404
BECAUSE RYAN
PUT ME ON PROBATION.

01:41.436 --> 01:43.975
YOU REMEMBER RYAN.
HE WAS THE TEMP HERE.

01:44.007 --> 01:45.979
YEAH. AND, UH...

01:46.011 --> 01:48.918
IT IS NOT A GOOD TIME
FOR ME TO LOSE MY JOB

01:48.950 --> 01:51.424
SINCE I HAVE SOME PRETTY BIG
LONG-TERM PLANS

01:51.456 --> 01:53.025
IN MY PERSONAL LIFE WITH PAM

01:53.058 --> 01:54.930
THAT I'D LIKE HER PARENTS
TO BE PSYCHED ABOUT.

01:54.962 --> 01:58.771
SO I AM ABOUT TO DO
SOMETHING VERY BOLD AT THIS JOB

01:58.805 --> 02:00.241
THAT I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE--

02:00.241 --> 02:01.776
TRY.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.047
WHOA!

02:04.081 --> 02:05.285
MR. MAGUIRE.

02:05.319 --> 02:06.954
IT'S BEEN
A COUPLE OF YEARS.

02:06.986 --> 02:09.024
HEY, JIM, HOW ARE YA?
NICE TO SEE YOU, MAN.

02:09.058 --> 02:09.827
OH, NO!

02:09.859 --> 02:11.930
[chuckling]
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

02:11.963 --> 02:14.936
MY GRANDFATHER
WOULD BE SPINNING IN HIS URN

02:14.969 --> 02:17.742
IF HE KNEW THAT I WAS
OUT HERE WITH A DARTMOUTH BOY.

02:17.776 --> 02:19.078
YOU TAKE THAT SHIRT OFF
RIGHT NOW,

02:19.110 --> 02:20.914
OR I WILL
TAKE IT OFF FOR YOU, SIR.

02:20.949 --> 02:22.386
I AM TOTALLY

02:22.418 --> 02:23.955
AND COMPLETELY KIDDING!

PHIL MAGUIRE,
DARTMOUTH, '74.

02:28.965 --> 02:30.369
OOP. GOT SOME BLISTIES.

02:30.402 --> 02:31.436
YEAH, YOU DO.

02:31.471 --> 02:33.441
HIT ABOUT 1,200 BALLS
LAST NIGHT

02:33.475 --> 02:36.581
IN PREPARATION FOR TODAY,
SO HANDS ARE A LITTLE TENDER.

02:36.613 --> 02:38.750
[chuckling]
IT'S ACTUALLY
NOT FUNNY AT ALL.

02:38.784 --> 02:39.820
IT'S INCREDIBLY PAINFUL.

02:39.853 --> 02:40.889
LET'S MAKE IT INTERESTING.

02:40.922 --> 02:42.725
SAY, UH...10 BUCKS
A HOLE.

02:42.758 --> 02:43.895
GREAT.

02:43.928 --> 02:44.997
WHAT ARE WE TALKIN'?
SKINS?

02:45.030 --> 02:47.101
ACEY DEUCY?
BINGO BANGO BONGO?

02:47.133 --> 02:48.938
SANDIES, BARKIES, ARNIES?

02:48.971 --> 02:50.442
WOLF?
WHAT?

02:50.475 --> 02:51.911
I'M GONNA TAKE

02:51.944 --> 02:54.782
THIS PETTY CASH
THAT I GOT FROM OSCAR

02:54.816 --> 02:59.125
AND TURN IT
INTO NEXT MONTH'S RENT.

02:59.157 --> 03:01.696
[overlapping chatter]

03:01.731 --> 03:05.604
(Pam)
SO MANY MEMORIES
IN THIS OLD GYM.

03:05.639 --> 03:06.673
PRETENDING I HAVE PMS

03:06.707 --> 03:08.477
SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY
VOLLEYBALL.

03:08.510 --> 03:09.579
PRETENDING I HAVE PMS

03:09.613 --> 03:12.619
SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY
BASKETBALL.

03:12.652 --> 03:14.723
THOSE WERE THE DAYS.

03:18.965 --> 03:20.935
LITTLE OVER THE TOP,
DON'T YOU THINK?

03:20.969 --> 03:22.773
SHOW 'EM WHAT
YOU BROUGHT, MIKE.

03:22.805 --> 03:23.908
UM...

03:23.941 --> 03:25.176
THAT'S
ALL WE BROUGHT.

03:25.211 --> 03:27.081
THIS IS ALL WE NEED.
WE'LL SEE.

03:27.113 --> 03:28.850
YES, WE WILL SEE,
OSCAR.

03:28.884 --> 03:30.119
WE WILL SEE,

03:30.153 --> 03:31.856
BECAUSE A BLANK
SHEET OF PAPER

03:31.890 --> 03:34.095
EQUALS ENDLESS
POSSIBILITIES.

03:34.128 --> 03:36.634
CONCEPTUAL.
ALL RIGHT.

03:36.666 --> 03:38.971
WE ARE...

03:39.005 --> 03:40.709
OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

03:44.148 --> 03:45.150
HELLO.

03:51.095 --> 03:52.633
ANDY, YOU'RE UP.
LET'S GO.

03:52.666 --> 03:53.934
GIDDY-UP.
LET'S DO THIS.

(Andy)
PEOPLE ASSUME
I'M GREAT AT GOLF,

03:56.806 --> 03:58.143
BUT LIKE EVERYBODY,

03:58.176 --> 04:00.080
I HATED GOLF LESSONS
WHEN I WAS A KID.

04:00.113 --> 04:03.152
SO I USED TO JUST HANG OUT
WITH THE SAILING CLUB INSTEAD.

04:03.186 --> 04:05.190
GOT MY KNOT ON.

04:06.861 --> 04:08.162
DAMN IT!

04:11.670 --> 04:13.875
(Meredith)
GUYS, DO WE HAVE TO STAY
ALL DAY?

04:13.908 --> 04:16.079
I MEAN, MICHAEL'S GONE.
CAN'T WE JUST GO?

04:16.111 --> 04:18.215
YEAH. AND I FINISHED
MY WORK MONTHS AGO.

04:18.249 --> 04:19.919
EXCUSE ME, PEOPLE.

04:19.952 --> 04:21.824
IT HAS COME
TO MY ATTENTION

04:21.856 --> 04:24.662
THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN
WHO IS IN CHARGE HERE.

04:24.697 --> 04:27.935
WHEN MICHAEL IS GONE,
JIM IS IN CHARGE.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.842
WHEN JIM IS GONE,
ANDY AND I ARE IN CHARGE.

04:30.874 --> 04:35.719
WHEN ANDY IS GONE,
YOU ANSWER TO ME, OKAY?

04:35.752 --> 04:37.788
EXCUSE ME, WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

04:37.823 --> 04:39.258
OH, NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.362
NO! STANLEY.

04:41.395 --> 04:43.233
DO NOT WALK OUT
THAT DOOR!

04:43.266 --> 04:45.370
IF YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR,
SO HELP ME,

04:45.403 --> 04:47.207
I WILL--

04:48.276 --> 04:50.113

04:50.147 --> 04:52.184
LAST TIME I CHECKED,

04:52.217 --> 04:53.286
THE AMERICAN WORKDAY

04:53.319 --> 04:55.358
ENDS AT 5:00 P.M.

04:55.390 --> 04:57.629
YOU WILL ALL STAY
AT YOUR DESKS

04:57.663 --> 04:59.298
UNTIL THAT TIME

04:59.331 --> 05:01.837
OR YOU WILL SUFFER
THE CONSEQUENCES.

05:01.870 --> 05:03.640
WHAT CONSEQUENCES?

05:04.943 --> 05:06.647
I WILL TELL ON YOU.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.317
THERE'S SOME FILING,

05:08.349 --> 05:10.654
RESTOCKING
THE SUPPLY SHELVES,

05:10.689 --> 05:13.225
REPLACING THE WATER JUG,
WHICH NOBODY LIKES TO DO.

05:13.258 --> 05:14.294
[chuckles]
UM...

05:14.328 --> 05:16.801
WE, UH,

05:16.833 --> 05:18.268
EAT A LOT OF CAKE.

05:18.303 --> 05:19.839
COOL.
[laughs]

05:19.873 --> 05:21.376
YEAH, AND, UH,
YOU KNOW,

05:21.409 --> 05:23.948
YOU BASICALLY, YOU LEARN
HOW AN OFFICE RUNS.

05:23.980 --> 05:25.183
HELLO.
SO...

05:25.217 --> 05:26.920
HI. CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SEC?

05:26.954 --> 05:28.457
EXCUSE ME.
THIS IS MICHAEL,
MY BOSS.

05:28.489 --> 05:29.792
YEAH.
JUSTIN.

05:29.827 --> 05:31.863
HEY, REMEMBER WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT

05:31.897 --> 05:33.299
IN THE CAR
ON THE WAY OUT?

05:33.333 --> 05:36.004
"ONLY THE BEST
AND THE BRIGHTEST"?

05:36.038 --> 05:37.474
HE'S NICE,
AND HE SEEMS INTERESTED.

05:37.507 --> 05:39.813
HE'S TOTALLY WRONG,
PAM.

05:39.847 --> 05:41.148
HEY...

05:41.182 --> 05:42.819
HI.

05:42.853 --> 05:45.089

05:45.122 --> 05:47.194

FUNNY, SMART,

05:47.227 --> 05:49.231
FUNNY-LOOKING KID
LIKE YOU

05:49.265 --> 05:50.433
SHOULD LIMIT HIMSELF.

05:50.468 --> 05:52.036
YOU COULD DO
WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO.

05:52.070 --> 05:54.341
YOU COULD BE
A CLASSY JANITOR

05:54.376 --> 05:57.180
OR A CASHIER WITH DIGNITY
OR A...

05:57.214 --> 06:00.353
MIGRAINE WORKER.

06:02.123 --> 06:04.763
MAYBE FOR YOU, PAPER SHOULD BE
MORE OF A HOBBY.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.232
SORRY FOR WASTING
YOUR TIME.

06:06.265 --> 06:07.200
OH, NO PROBLEM.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.807
AND HE SIGNED!

06:09.839 --> 06:12.077
HE PUT HIS NAME
ON THE PIECE OF--

06:12.111 --> 06:13.847
OKAY, THAT...

06:13.880 --> 06:15.819
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A BLANK CANVAS

06:15.851 --> 06:17.789
ON WHICH TO PUT
THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS,

06:17.823 --> 06:19.927
AND HE JUST...

06:19.959 --> 06:21.563
MADE IT INTO A STUPID
PIECE OF PAPER.

06:21.595 --> 06:24.368
WE NEED ANOTHER ONE
IMMEDIATELY.

06:24.401 --> 06:26.305
YEAH. THE BOOTH
IS LAME WITHOUT IT.

06:26.339 --> 06:27.508
I ONLY BROUGHT
THE ONE.

06:27.541 --> 06:30.046
ARE YOU MENTAL?

06:30.080 --> 06:32.084
MICHAEL, DO YOU REMEMBER
YOU SPECIFICALLY TOLD ME

06:32.116 --> 06:34.020
TO ONLY BRING
ONE SHEET OF PAPER?

06:34.055 --> 06:36.359
YOU SAID IT ONLY TAKES
ONE SHEET TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

06:36.392 --> 06:38.195
AND I SAID,
"ARE YOU SURE, MICHAEL?"

06:38.228 --> 06:39.432
AND YOU SAID,
"PAM, PAM, PAM."

06:39.466 --> 06:41.403
AND THEN YOU SNEEZED
IN MY TEA.

06:41.436 --> 06:44.375
AND THEN YOU SAID, "DON'T WORRY.
IT'S JUST ALLERGIES."

06:44.409 --> 06:45.343
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

06:45.377 --> 06:47.213
I...DON'T.

06:48.450 --> 06:51.891
OKAY. I'LL GO LOOK
FOR ANOTHER ONE.

06:51.924 --> 06:54.260
AND THAT...IS WHY

06:54.294 --> 06:56.365
I NEED A SMART INTERN.

06:56.934 --> 06:59.204
HEY, SO, UH, HOW'S
THE DIRECT MAIL BUSINESS GOING?

06:59.237 --> 07:02.011
I CAN'T COMPLAIN.
PEOPLE LOVE THEIR JUNK MAIL.

07:02.043 --> 07:03.948

ALL YOUR PAPER FROM PPC, OR...

07:03.981 --> 07:05.551
YOU KNOW WHAT, JIM?

07:05.583 --> 07:07.488
I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING
TO CHANGE THINGS UP RIGHT NOW.

07:07.521 --> 07:09.992
I JUST CAME OUT HERE TO GET
OUT OF THE OFFICE A LITTLE BIT,

07:10.026 --> 07:12.030

07:28.697 --> 07:30.501
WELL, IT'S FUNNY
THAT YOU SHOULD ASK,

07:30.533 --> 07:33.272
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY...
MORE THAN A COMPANY.

09:02.283 --> 09:03.587
MICHAEL,
I KNOW YOU'RE SWAMPED.

09:03.619 --> 09:05.256
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW

09:05.290 --> 09:07.494
THAT EVERYONE
IN THE OFFICE HAS LEFT

09:07.526 --> 09:08.896
EXCEPT FOR ANGELA AND I.

09:08.930 --> 09:10.433
DO NOT WORRY, THOUGH.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.702
I HAVE TAKEN DOWN
THEIR NAMES,

(Pam)
I JUST DROVE 20 MILES
ROUND TRIP BACK TO THE OFFICE

11:03.526 --> 11:05.898

I'M SORRY, I GOT TO ANNOY YOU

11:25.636 --> 11:27.506
WHAT IF I BRING DOWN
SHIPPING COSTS?

11:27.541 --> 11:29.177
YOU CAN TRY.

11:29.209 --> 11:31.048
BUT I'VE LOOKED
AT YOUR PRICES.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.922
EVEN WITH FREE SHIPPING...

11:34.956 --> 11:35.823
DOESN'T WORK.

11:35.857 --> 11:38.628
IT'S JUST--IT'S NOT

11:42.036 --> 11:43.473

11:54.027 --> 11:55.029
OH!

12:00.740 --> 12:03.513
I FELL IN THE SAND TRAP.

12:10.058 --> 12:11.796
[machine beeping]

12:11.830 --> 12:13.732
[copier whirring]

12:21.882 --> 12:24.555
(Michael)
ALL OF THESE JOBS SUCK.

12:24.588 --> 12:27.226
I WOULD RATHER LIVE JOBLESS
ON A BEACH SOMEWHERE

12:27.259 --> 12:29.164
OFF THE MONEY
FROM A LARGE INHERITANCE

12:29.196 --> 12:33.072
THAN TO HAVE TO WORK
IN ANY ONE OF THESE CRAPHOLES.

12:33.105 --> 12:34.541
THEY SUCK.

12:36.211 --> 12:37.914
HEY.

12:37.947 --> 12:39.184
GAME OVER.

12:42.991 --> 12:44.628

12:50.840 --> 12:53.245
"THIS...JUST IN:

12:53.277 --> 12:55.149
JUSTIN POLZNIK."

12:55.182 --> 12:56.752
[laughs]
HUH?

12:56.785 --> 12:59.224
JUSTIN IS THE UGLY GIRL
IN THE MOVIE

12:59.257 --> 13:01.561
WHO TAKES OFF HER GLASSES,
AND SHE'S HOT.

13:01.561 --> 13:04.134
AND YOU REALIZE
THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS HOT,

13:04.167 --> 13:05.335
SHE WAS
JUST WEARING GLASSES,

13:05.368 --> 13:08.241
AND THAT YOU WERE
THE BLIND ONE.

13:08.275 --> 13:09.845
HE'S THE MOST...

13:09.879 --> 13:12.115
IMPORTANT THING
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

13:12.150 --> 13:13.887
I WANT YOU...
TO MEET MY FAMILY.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.822
COME ON.

13:14.855 --> 13:17.326

ACCOUNTANT EXTRAORDINAIRE.

13:17.359 --> 13:18.897

13:20.031 --> 13:21.734

13:21.769 --> 13:23.071
ISN'T HE BIG?

13:23.105 --> 13:26.310
AND YOU ALREADY MET HER,
PAM BEESLY, OFFICE HOTTIE.

13:26.344 --> 13:28.014
SHE WILL DO YOU.

13:28.047 --> 13:29.685
[giggling]

13:29.718 --> 13:30.687
NO. NO.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.657
BUT SHE HAS ALREADY
DATED TWO GUYS IN THE OFFICE

13:32.691 --> 13:34.294
THAT WE KNOW OF, SO...

13:34.327 --> 13:36.298
THIS COULD BE
NUMBER THREE, YOU NEVER...

13:36.331 --> 13:37.365
EXCUSE ME.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.069
[whispers]
COME HERE.

13:39.103 --> 13:40.908
I WOULD NEVER
SAY THIS TO HER FACE,

13:40.940 --> 13:43.444
BUT SHE IS A WONDERFUL PERSON
AND A GIFTED ARTIST.

13:43.477 --> 13:45.349
WHY--WHY WOULDN'T YOU
SAY THAT TO HER FACE?

13:45.381 --> 13:47.420
SO...WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:47.452 --> 13:49.224
THINK THESE GUYS
ARE NICE?

13:49.257 --> 13:50.993
GUYS I DIDN'T BRING
ARE EVEN BETTER.

13:51.027 --> 13:52.797
JUSTIN...

13:52.831 --> 13:56.805
I'M WILLING TO COMMIT
RIGHT NOW.

13:56.840 --> 14:00.279
WOULD YOU

14:00.312 --> 14:03.118
OF SPENDING
THE SUMMER WITH US

14:03.152 --> 14:04.387
AT DUNDER MIFFLIN?

14:04.420 --> 14:06.357
I THINK--I THINK
YOU ARE VERY SPECIAL.

14:06.391 --> 14:08.328
YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
BEFORE.

14:08.361 --> 14:10.298
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

14:10.331 --> 14:11.834
NO, I DIDN'T.

14:11.869 --> 14:13.973
YOU WERE--YOU WERE
KIND OF A JERK TO ME.

14:14.007 --> 14:15.042
I...

14:15.076 --> 14:16.310
AND I'M--
I'M GONNA GO NOW.

14:16.343 --> 14:18.715
WHY DON'T--HEY.

14:20.019 --> 14:22.155
[laughs]

14:40.091 --> 14:41.761
AH-CHOO!

14:43.564 --> 14:45.135

14:46.570 --> 14:47.773

14:54.054 --> 14:56.291
OKAY, JIM,
YOU OWE ME 120.

14:56.324 --> 15:00.399
AND PHIL,

15:00.432 --> 15:01.801
LET'S OPEN A TAB,

15:01.801 --> 15:04.274
BECAUSE YOU AND ME ARE GONNA
BE PLAYIN' MORE OFTEN.

15:04.307 --> 15:06.178
COUNT ME IN.
NO.

15:06.211 --> 15:07.180
ALL RIGHT.

15:07.213 --> 15:08.215
OKAY.

15:08.247 --> 15:11.955
YOU HAD SOME FUN AND, UH,
AND GOT PAID FOR IT.

15:11.989 --> 15:15.495
SO LET ME JUST GET
MY LAST SHOT IN THERE.

15:15.528 --> 15:17.032
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN DO FOR ME?

15:17.066 --> 15:18.167
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

15:18.202 --> 15:20.206
MY FISCAL YEAR
ENDS IN TWO MONTHS.

15:20.238 --> 15:21.508
LET'S TALK THEN.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.012
SOUND GOOD?
ABSOLUTELY.

15:23.044 --> 15:24.479
GOOD PLAYING

15:24.514 --> 15:25.516
(Andy)
RIGHT ON.

15:28.989 --> 15:30.526
(Jim)
YOU KNOW, IT'S A TOUGH THING

15:30.558 --> 15:32.363
SEEING A GROWN MAN
TAKE SIX SHOTS

15:32.396 --> 15:34.367
TO GET OUT OF A SAND TRAP.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.239
BUT I HAD TO GIVE PHIL
CREDIT FOR NOT QUITTING.

15:37.272 --> 15:38.674
WHICH IS WHAT I TOLD HIM.

15:38.707 --> 15:41.180
I ALSO TOLD HIM
THAT I DON'T QUIT EITHER...

15:41.213 --> 15:42.917
AND I'D CALL HIM
EVERY SINGLE DAY

15:42.952 --> 15:44.487
UNTIL HE
GAVE ME HIS BUSINESS.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.357
WHICH HE THEN DID...

15:46.391 --> 15:50.032
AFTER...15 MINUTES
OF ME BLOCKING HIS CAR.

15:50.066 --> 15:53.405
SO I AM NOW
HIS PAPER SUPPLIER.

15:53.438 --> 15:58.214
AND I SHOT A 102 TODAY,
SO I'M FEELIN' PRETTY GOOD.

15:58.247 --> 16:01.421
(woman)
THE JOB FAIR WILL BE CLOSING
IN FIVE MINUTES.

16:01.454 --> 16:04.627
EIGHTH PERIOD WILL COMMENCE

16:04.660 --> 16:06.498
HOLD DOWN THE FORT.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.566
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

16:18.154 --> 16:19.124
EXCUSE ME.

16:19.156 --> 16:21.427
IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,

16:21.461 --> 16:24.634
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO LOOK AROUND
AT ALL THESE COMPANIES

16:24.666 --> 16:29.577
AND KNOW THAT NONE OF THEM
ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

16:29.609 --> 16:31.348
H&R BLOCK?

16:31.380 --> 16:32.783
COME ON!

16:32.815 --> 16:35.122

16:38.361 --> 16:40.199
TOO MUCH FORMALDEHYDE.

16:40.231 --> 16:42.802

16:42.835 --> 16:45.042
AIR FORCE IS COOL.

16:45.076 --> 16:48.247
THE REFRESHMENTS?
BUSH LEAGUE, YOU KNOW?

16:48.282 --> 16:50.119
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT.

16:51.621 --> 16:52.489
DUNDER--

16:52.523 --> 16:54.094
THAT--OKAY.

16:54.127 --> 16:55.495
I SEE SECURITY IS COMING,

16:55.529 --> 16:58.068
SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY
COME TO DUNDER MIFFLIN.

16:58.102 --> 17:00.371

17:00.405 --> 17:02.042

ANYBODY WANNA INTERN

17:04.213 --> 17:05.348
WE DO NOT OFFER

17:05.382 --> 17:07.453
WE CANNOT GIVE YOU
ANY SORT OF PAY,

17:07.485 --> 17:09.757

I QUESTIONED MYSELF,

18:39.837 --> 18:41.774

I DON'T KNOW

19:44.032 --> 19:46.438
[laughs]
IT'S ACTUALLY
