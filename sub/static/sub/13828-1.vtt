WEBVTT

00:09.805 --> 00:12.274
Let's go.

00:12.308 --> 00:15.108
- Let's go. Get up.
- Go away.

00:15.142 --> 00:16.309
It's after 5:00.

00:16.344 --> 00:18.645
You've been out all day. It's time to go.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.480
And you got your butt kicked again.

00:20.514 --> 00:22.249
I told you, if you gonna
fight in that biker bar,

00:22.284 --> 00:23.550
you gotta keep your hands up.

00:23.585 --> 00:25.852
Hey. Any coffee?

00:25.887 --> 00:28.188
Yeah, right there by
that mint on your pillow.

01:07.059 --> 01:09.061
- Hurry up!
- He's going into shock!

01:09.096 --> 01:10.730
I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:10.764 --> 01:12.248
- We're losing him.
- Do something.

01:12.249 --> 01:14.999
- I can't stop the bleeding.
- Here, take out the branch!

01:15.002 --> 01:15.868
Can't take out the branch.

01:15.936 --> 01:17.170
- He'll bleed out.
- No, he won't.

01:17.204 --> 01:18.738
Sir, get back and give us some space.

01:18.772 --> 01:19.239
I'm a doctor.

01:19.273 --> 01:20.974
We're gonna take the
branch out and do a D.P.L.

01:21.008 --> 01:22.141
We don't have enough blood to transfuse.

01:22.175 --> 01:23.343
Yeah, yeah, get me all your bags.

01:23.377 --> 01:24.477
A saline pack, a couple tubes,

01:24.511 --> 01:25.878
a needle and scalpel.

01:25.912 --> 01:27.479
We're gonna go on three, all right?

01:27.514 --> 01:30.016
One... two... three.

01:38.726 --> 01:39.759
He's gonna bleed out.

01:39.793 --> 01:41.262
No, he's not.

01:41.296 --> 01:43.363
His renal artery is
cut. I'm gonna clamp it.

01:43.497 --> 01:46.033
We're gonna use his blood.
Start a line. Go, go, go, go.

01:49.336 --> 01:52.072
Hang in there, buddy. Keep breathing.

02:03.784 --> 02:06.052
All right. When that fills up,

02:06.086 --> 02:07.553
take it off, pump it back into him.

02:07.588 --> 02:09.121
Then we step up with a new bag.

02:09.156 --> 02:11.356
Kind of like a bucket brigade at a fire.

02:11.391 --> 02:12.424
Ready?

02:18.231 --> 02:21.333
Holy crap. It's working.
Where'd you learn that?

02:21.367 --> 02:23.468
Afghanistan.

02:23.503 --> 02:25.504
All right. Let's move.

02:29.376 --> 02:30.442
The defibrillator

02:30.477 --> 02:31.776
in your wife's pacemaker

02:31.811 --> 02:33.846
is malfunctioning, causing
her to be repeatedly shocked.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.614
- So make it stop.
- I can't.

02:35.648 --> 02:36.883
We are contractually obligated

02:36.917 --> 02:38.351
to call the pacemaker company,

02:38.385 --> 02:40.286
and they send a technician
over to reset it.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.454
So what, she's in pain the whole time

02:42.489 --> 02:43.288
until the tech gets here?

02:43.323 --> 02:44.957
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's
just not gonna happen.

02:44.991 --> 02:48.027
Hi. I'm Dr. Alexander,
and I'm going to deactivate

02:48.061 --> 02:49.561
your defibrillator with a magnet.

02:49.596 --> 02:51.197
Jordan, this is my patient.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.466
Then you should have
been the one helping her.

02:52.470 --> 02:53.771
If anything happens, we're legally...

02:53.867 --> 02:55.634
The only thing that's
going to happen is that you

02:55.668 --> 02:57.136
are going to stop feeling
like a horse is kicking you

02:57.170 --> 02:59.170
in the chest, okay? It's perfectly safe.

03:00.873 --> 03:02.574
There we go.

03:04.844 --> 03:06.311
There you go.

03:06.346 --> 03:08.814
Better, right? Alright, so
we're gonna get a tech in here,

03:08.849 --> 03:10.015
and we'll have that reset,

03:10.050 --> 03:11.450
and then you will be on your way.

03:11.484 --> 03:12.852
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Sure.

03:16.122 --> 03:18.056
All right, let's go.
Let's clear it out, guys.

03:18.090 --> 03:19.059
Make a hole, please.

03:19.060 --> 03:20.992
I need a type and screen
and 2 units of blood!

03:20.993 --> 03:22.127
You got it.

03:22.161 --> 03:24.028
You got real lucky taking that branch out.

03:24.063 --> 03:25.396
Luck had nothing to do with it, Hank.

03:25.431 --> 03:26.465
I heard about it over dispatch.

03:26.499 --> 03:27.932
Hell of a way to start your shift.

03:27.967 --> 03:29.268
Wouldn't have been my first choice.

03:29.302 --> 03:30.469
Jeez, T.C., you look like crap.

03:30.803 --> 03:32.270
Yeah, pulling a tree out of a guy's stomach

03:32.304 --> 03:33.237
tends to get a little messy.

03:33.372 --> 03:35.539
I was talking about your
face. Are you fighting again?

03:35.574 --> 03:36.775
I didn't start this one.

03:36.809 --> 03:38.243
You never do. Look, I really

03:38.277 --> 03:39.911
need your paperwork for
the Drug Company study.

03:39.946 --> 03:41.780
You know that I am trying
to fund a extra position

03:41.814 --> 03:43.815
for the day shift, and
you are a month behind.

03:43.850 --> 03:45.851
- Am I?
- Yes, you are.

03:45.885 --> 03:47.618
Look, the only thing that I need you to do

03:47.652 --> 03:49.020
is just take one day, all right?

03:49.354 --> 03:50.721
One day to finish your paperwork

03:50.756 --> 03:52.356
instead of going out, getting drunk,

03:52.391 --> 03:54.024
and getting yourself in fights.

03:54.058 --> 03:54.993
Hey.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.427
I'm done being nice about this.

03:56.462 --> 03:57.896
This is nice?

03:57.930 --> 03:59.130
You know what?

03:59.164 --> 04:01.165
I am gonna ride you until
I get that paperwork...

04:01.200 --> 04:03.501
You've got a boyfriend,
Jordan, so sex with me

04:03.535 --> 04:05.069
is not gonna happen, but nice try.

04:05.104 --> 04:06.904
You know what? You are so full of yourself.

04:06.938 --> 04:09.440
Good morning/evening. This is very cute,

04:09.475 --> 04:11.409
but that... that's her.

04:11.443 --> 04:12.576
- I wish I did that.
- Oh.

04:12.611 --> 04:14.278
He's hungover... again.

04:14.313 --> 04:15.779
Oh, come on, J.

04:15.814 --> 04:17.415
I-I've seen you sucking on a bong

04:17.449 --> 04:18.781
like you were giving it C.P.R.

04:18.817 --> 04:19.783
Whoa, that's nothing. She used to...

04:19.817 --> 04:21.118
You know what? You shut up, all right?

04:21.452 --> 04:23.787
And, Topher, that was ages ago.

04:23.822 --> 04:26.891
T.C., please, just give me
the paperwork, all right?

04:26.925 --> 04:28.091
For me.

04:28.126 --> 04:29.627
Got a 2-weeker. B.P. dropping,

04:29.661 --> 04:31.929
possible renal failure.
Pulse down to 83 from 94.

04:31.963 --> 04:33.030
I got it. I got it.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.765
Mom says she has a congenital deformity

04:34.799 --> 04:36.799
with her kidneys, no
wet diaper for two days.

04:36.834 --> 04:37.568
Call pediatrics.

04:37.602 --> 04:40.203
She's swelling. I need a
bedside ultra sound, stat!

04:40.638 --> 04:42.205
Okay.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.142
Night shift staff, report for duty.

04:45.176 --> 04:47.977
All night shift staff, report for duty.

04:48.047 --> 04:50.047
You know, they say juggling helps improve

04:50.081 --> 04:51.315
your surgical dexterity.

04:51.350 --> 04:52.449
Improves your hand-eye coordination,

04:52.483 --> 04:53.483
trains you in pattern recognition

04:53.518 --> 04:54.484
and that... that sort of thing.

04:54.519 --> 04:55.719
That's great.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.487
You're, uh, you're Krista, right?

04:57.522 --> 04:58.822
Yeah.

04:58.857 --> 05:00.323
Paul...

05:00.358 --> 05:01.525
Cummings.

05:01.559 --> 05:03.827
Yeah, we met last year
at the Intern Interviews.

05:03.862 --> 05:05.896
Talked about the M.C.A.T.s.
You scored a 34, right?

05:05.931 --> 05:08.465
- 35.
- Oh, I got, like, a 35.6.

05:08.599 --> 05:09.766
Good for you.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.371
I wouldn't be doing that, new guy.

05:14.405 --> 05:15.905
Oh, no worries, man. I know
what I'm doing, all right?

05:16.040 --> 05:17.840
I can juggle anything.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.243
Even junk from the lost
and found, you know?

05:19.278 --> 05:21.278
Yeah. Yeah, that's not lost and found.

05:21.312 --> 05:22.513
Those are things the docs

05:22.547 --> 05:24.614
have taken out of people's
rectums this month.

05:24.648 --> 05:26.450
Ugh.

05:26.484 --> 05:30.253
Yeah. I'd wash my hands
if I were you... 35.6.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.658
Yo, Doctor, the newbies, Krista and Paul,

05:35.693 --> 05:38.161
need to tag along with you
until Dr. Knox is available.

05:38.196 --> 05:40.697
I wouldn't shake his hand...

05:40.731 --> 05:43.932
Oh. Exam 5, a
42-year-old man

05:43.966 --> 05:45.502
with lacerations on his testicles.

05:45.536 --> 05:46.636
Come on, man. I just ate.

05:46.670 --> 05:48.105
Wait until you see it.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.540
The guy "claims" he's
cleaning his bathtub naked

05:50.574 --> 05:51.875
when his cat pounced
on his swinging scrotum

05:51.910 --> 05:53.210
like it was a chew toy.

05:53.244 --> 05:55.545
E.M.T.s had to drug the
cat to get him to let go.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.847
Hey. How much longer do I have to wait?

05:57.881 --> 05:59.015
I've been here for over an hour.

05:59.049 --> 06:00.283
And you're behind people

06:00.318 --> 06:02.085
who have been here for
two hours. I'm sorry.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.286
We're undermanned,

06:03.321 --> 06:04.788
and we're right in the
middle of a shift change.

06:04.822 --> 06:05.988
We'll be with you in just a moment.

06:06.023 --> 06:07.124
I want to be seen now.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.291
Sir, I...

06:08.326 --> 06:10.527
- I said now, bitch!
- Whoa. Hey! Hey!

06:10.561 --> 06:12.095
Sir, you need to... aah!

06:12.130 --> 06:13.529
- Hey, calm down!
- Uhh!

06:13.563 --> 06:14.564
Hey, hey, hey, bubba, bubba,

06:14.565 --> 06:15.598
- hey, just calm down.
- Come on!

06:15.599 --> 06:17.267
All right, we don't want any trouble, man.

06:17.901 --> 06:20.237
Aah!

06:20.271 --> 06:22.271
Don't fight it. Don't fight it.

06:22.305 --> 06:25.374
You're about to go sleepy
time in about five seconds.

06:25.408 --> 06:29.311
There. Come on. Like a little baby.

06:29.346 --> 06:31.814
Get his feet up in the
air. He'll wake up soon.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.049
Might wanna cuff him first, though.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.384
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Oh, you're welcome.

06:34.418 --> 06:36.152
Security to the E.R. security...

06:36.786 --> 06:37.887
Mr. Ragosa?

06:37.921 --> 06:40.489
I haven't made my decision yet, Jordan.

06:41.023 --> 06:43.058
Okay, so... in the meantime,

06:43.092 --> 06:44.894
nobody's in charge of the night shift?

06:44.928 --> 06:47.029
They're talking about
shutting the E.R. down.

06:47.063 --> 06:49.632
And I was promoted to make
sure that doesn't happen,

06:49.666 --> 06:51.733
and when I find the right person...

06:51.768 --> 06:53.669
But I'm... I'm the right person.

06:53.703 --> 06:56.238
The night shift is not like the day shift.

06:56.273 --> 06:58.407
It's an undisciplined zoo.

06:58.441 --> 07:00.309
Last week someone stole my cell phone

07:00.343 --> 07:02.177
and sent erotic texts to my dentist.

07:02.211 --> 07:05.313
That's how they blow off steam.

07:05.347 --> 07:07.049
Half the shift is ex-military,

07:07.083 --> 07:08.917
so, you know, they work hard and...

07:08.951 --> 07:11.153
- they play hard.
- Well, I don't like it.

07:11.187 --> 07:13.221
That attitude isn't gonna go away.

07:13.255 --> 07:14.990
We're surrounded by military bases.

07:15.024 --> 07:16.491
It's our workforce.

07:16.525 --> 07:18.593
But I see that as a positive, all right?

07:18.627 --> 07:20.928
They're already a team. They
just need a focused leader.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.298
You've seen how hard I
work on the day shift.

07:23.332 --> 07:25.800
Make me the chief of the night shift.

07:25.834 --> 07:26.935
Give me a chance to prove myself

07:26.969 --> 07:28.336
and keep this place open.

07:29.171 --> 07:31.573
What have you got to lose?

07:33.342 --> 07:36.410
Sir, uh, stay still, sir.

07:38.814 --> 07:41.116
I swear to God, no
matter how long I do this,

07:41.150 --> 07:43.251
it always freaks me out to be this close

07:43.285 --> 07:44.886
to a guy's shredded business.

07:46.021 --> 07:48.656
I'm gonna let you guys finish
up the last couple of stitches.

07:48.690 --> 07:50.025
Who wants to go first?

07:50.059 --> 07:53.227
Oh, man, that's... that's
really nasty. Mm, no.

07:53.261 --> 07:56.731
I'll do it. I've seen way
worse testicles than these.

08:02.172 --> 08:03.606
Uh, ow!

08:04.140 --> 08:05.373
Sorry.

08:08.777 --> 08:10.578
Are you okay?

08:12.648 --> 08:14.682
What's the deal with pediatrics?

08:14.717 --> 08:16.151
We need to get her on dialysis.

08:16.185 --> 08:19.787
They're saying Ragosa told
them we can't admit her.

08:19.822 --> 08:21.957
Dr. Callahan, please report

08:21.991 --> 08:24.826
to the staff meeting immediately.

08:27.896 --> 08:28.929
Wow.

08:28.964 --> 08:30.598
I don't need to tell you people

08:30.632 --> 08:33.000
that hospitals are struggling to stay open.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.635
With fiscal challenges, ObamaCare,

08:35.671 --> 08:38.506
we need to cut costs,
improve customer satisfaction,

08:38.539 --> 08:40.174
and increase profits.

08:40.207 --> 08:42.808
And to help us achieve those goals

08:42.844 --> 08:44.444
is our new interim
chief of the night shift,

08:44.479 --> 08:45.712
Dr. Jordan Alexander.

08:45.747 --> 08:47.348
Congrats, Jordan.

08:47.382 --> 08:48.716
Whoo, Jordan! Look, I just wanna say

08:48.750 --> 08:50.385
I'm really excited to work with all of you,

08:50.419 --> 08:51.752
and we're gonna do some great things.

08:51.787 --> 08:54.021
For starters, we're
going to be implementing

08:54.055 --> 08:56.823
a new administrative program using...

08:56.858 --> 08:58.025
These bad boys right here.

08:58.059 --> 08:59.560
They've really helped the day shift

08:59.595 --> 09:01.128
manage patient efficiency.

09:01.363 --> 09:03.798
All you have to do is enter
the patient's information,

09:03.832 --> 09:06.166
their diagnosis, the treat...

09:06.201 --> 09:09.470
Excuse me. Sorry I'm late
for your little pep rally.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.238
I had to take care of the baby.

09:11.272 --> 09:13.607
Did the ambulance arrive for her?

09:13.641 --> 09:15.909
I have no idea. I was busy,

09:15.943 --> 09:18.012
uh, setting her up for
dialysis in pediatrics.

09:18.046 --> 09:21.415
You admitted her? I told him
to transfer her back to Corpus.

09:21.449 --> 09:23.918
I determined that she wasn't
stable enough to travel.

09:23.952 --> 09:26.153
She was fine. She could have gone.

09:26.187 --> 09:27.354
Is that your opinion, Doctor?

09:28.823 --> 09:30.190
Wait. That's right.

09:30.225 --> 09:31.858
You're not a doctor.

09:35.730 --> 09:37.932
All right, all right, everybody, look,

09:37.966 --> 09:40.467
uh, meeting's over. Enjoy your shift.

09:40.501 --> 09:41.936
Thank you very much.

09:43.771 --> 09:46.172
I need you to override his diagnosis.

09:46.206 --> 09:48.542
Well, I'd have to examine
her first. I don't...

09:48.576 --> 09:51.077
Well, do it now.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.112
Yes.

09:52.147 --> 09:54.848
Hey! Welcome to the night shift, Jordan!

09:59.454 --> 10:02.454
- Synced and corrected by <font color="#30ad9e">Retrojex</font> -
- www.addic7ed.com -

10:03.024 --> 10:05.258
Aah! Get this thing off of me!

10:05.292 --> 10:07.693
Miss Pummer, you need to stop that.

10:07.728 --> 10:09.161
- Uh, can I help you?
- Yes!

10:09.196 --> 10:10.695
Matt Damon is trying to kill me.

10:10.730 --> 10:12.363
You know Matt Damon, "Bourne Identity,"

10:12.398 --> 10:13.298
"Good Will Hunting"?

10:13.333 --> 10:14.734
"The Talented Mr. Ripley."
People always forget

10:14.768 --> 10:15.968
he was in that one.

10:16.003 --> 10:18.070
I don't know how people could forget.

10:18.105 --> 10:19.672
I loved "The Talented Mr. Ripley."

10:19.706 --> 10:22.474
It was so edge of your
seat. So tell me something.

10:22.509 --> 10:24.543
What was your favorite scene?

10:24.577 --> 10:25.711
You know, it's so hard,

10:25.746 --> 10:27.812
because all of them and Matty is so...

10:27.847 --> 10:30.482
I love it when he sneaks into
the room with Philip... ow!

10:30.517 --> 10:32.551
Philip Seymour Hoffman,

10:32.585 --> 10:37.256
and then when he gets on... 
the boat with Jude Law,

10:37.290 --> 10:39.057
and he's on there...

10:39.091 --> 10:41.326
Okay. Nice ploy.

10:41.361 --> 10:43.729
Thanks for picking up on it.

10:43.763 --> 10:45.430
There we go.

10:45.765 --> 10:47.932
I'm Jordan, by the way.
We talked in passing

10:47.967 --> 10:50.135
when you started as the
psych attending last month.

10:50.169 --> 10:52.303
Landry. And I know who you
are. You're my new boss.

10:52.338 --> 10:53.305
I'd prefer "colleague."

10:53.639 --> 10:54.973
- I'll take it from here.
- Thank you.

10:56.676 --> 10:59.177
So, Landry, if you need anything,

10:59.211 --> 11:01.845
please, just don't hesitate to ask.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.113
Are you kidding?

11:03.148 --> 11:05.449
I-I need a holding room, a psych nurse,

11:05.484 --> 11:07.017
better access to the pharmacy.

11:07.052 --> 11:08.853
You should have had these
things your first night.

11:08.888 --> 11:11.089
Yeah. This shift is a
little "Lord of the Flies."

11:11.123 --> 11:13.724
Landry, we need a psych eval. Exam 4.

11:13.858 --> 11:15.926
Okay, look, I'm gonna get you
all of these things. All right?

11:15.961 --> 11:18.129
You do that, and I'll
buy you coffee for a week.

11:18.164 --> 11:19.197
Deal.

11:20.499 --> 11:22.733
Welcome to our break room.

11:24.803 --> 11:27.605
Look at this place. It's insane.

11:27.639 --> 11:29.373
This is awesome.

11:29.408 --> 11:30.509
It's night shift only.

11:30.543 --> 11:32.911
We come up here on breaks, after shifts.

11:33.245 --> 11:34.645
Here's my advice for your first year.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.247
Just watch, listen.

11:36.282 --> 11:37.683
Forget all of that stuff
you learned in med school,

11:37.717 --> 11:39.884
'cause we're gonna show you
stuff they didn't teach you.

11:39.919 --> 11:42.186
Do your best, and we'll
see if you can hack it.

11:44.390 --> 11:47.358
T.C. is such a badass. I
mean, he was an Army ranger,

11:47.393 --> 11:49.593
battlefield doc, top of his
class at Johns Hopkins Med.

11:49.594 --> 11:51.494
Right?

11:51.529 --> 11:52.663
Oh, I googled him.

11:52.697 --> 11:54.165
I google everyone I meet, so...

11:54.599 --> 11:55.766
Yeah.

11:55.801 --> 11:58.201
I would keep that to yourself.

11:59.204 --> 12:02.039
Guys, we got a G.S.W. Drew, you're up.

12:02.673 --> 12:05.609
- B.P. and heart rate dropping.
- Alright, what's happening in here?

12:05.644 --> 12:07.511
Simple G.S.W. I got the
bullet, but he's still bleeding.

12:07.546 --> 12:09.446
- You check for fragments?
- I got the whole bullet.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.681
Bone fragments.

12:10.716 --> 12:12.918
All right, give me the ultrasound.

12:12.952 --> 12:14.918
All right, Drew, the bullet hit the bone.

12:14.953 --> 12:17.822
Bone fragments pieces travel.

12:17.956 --> 12:19.623
All righty.

12:19.658 --> 12:21.925
Let's go. Come on.

12:23.294 --> 12:24.661
There it is. Right there.

12:24.695 --> 12:26.164
Your spleen. That's the
source of your bleeding.

12:26.198 --> 12:29.133
We need to get him to the O.R.

12:31.670 --> 12:33.504
The dialysis is working.

12:33.539 --> 12:35.072
Call me if there's any change.

12:38.810 --> 12:40.343
Tee, we have to figure this out.

12:40.378 --> 12:41.845
What do we have to figure out?

12:41.880 --> 12:43.280
You do your thing, I do mine.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.315
The only thing I need you to do

12:45.350 --> 12:46.884
is to show me some respect.

12:46.918 --> 12:48.151
Respect is earned, Jordan.

12:48.186 --> 12:50.120
Everybody thinks you're Ragosa's puppet.

12:50.154 --> 12:53.055
Oh, excuse me. I am not his puppet.

12:53.090 --> 12:55.558
You're discharging this
baby just like he wanted.

12:55.593 --> 12:57.527
After she recovers from her dialysis.

12:57.561 --> 12:59.328
If we keep her, what do I tell

12:59.363 --> 13:00.597
the next 50 people who come in here

13:00.631 --> 13:02.765
- that we cannot afford to treat?
- I'll treat them.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.968
God, did you... did you not learn anything

13:05.002 --> 13:06.736
from being kicked out of the army?

13:06.771 --> 13:10.439
You are an amazing doctor,
but for some reason,

13:10.473 --> 13:12.741
they thought that they
were better off without you

13:12.776 --> 13:15.378
during a war. What does that tell you?

13:15.412 --> 13:17.914
They care more about politics than lives.

13:17.948 --> 13:20.850
Do you not see how
self-destructive you are?

13:20.884 --> 13:23.287
You deserve better, T.C. You do.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.759
Hey. Hey.

13:29.794 --> 13:31.795
I need your A.T.M. card.
I'm a few hundred short.

13:31.829 --> 13:33.529
Why?

13:34.364 --> 13:35.831
Your bookie? Again?

13:35.865 --> 13:37.533
I may have lost a few.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.401
Uh...

13:39.436 --> 13:41.137
You really gotta stop
betting on basketball,

13:41.171 --> 13:43.371
'cause you really suck at it.

13:44.474 --> 13:46.274
- Yo, Topher?
- Yeah?

13:46.309 --> 13:47.209
Uh, you got a minute?

13:47.244 --> 13:48.177
Eddie's daughter came in.

13:48.212 --> 13:50.079
She's having some stomach issues.

13:50.113 --> 13:52.381
- Could you look at her?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.384
Ow.

13:56.118 --> 13:58.053
- Does that
hurt? - Mm-hmm.

13:58.187 --> 13:59.154
Sorry.

13:59.188 --> 14:01.456
Has it always been this
size, or has it gotten bigger?

14:01.790 --> 14:05.226
It's gotten bigger in the last few years.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.729
I'm sorry to bother you with this.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.030
It's just been hurting so much lately.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.298
It's been hard to work.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.867
What have other doctors said?

14:12.501 --> 14:16.472
That I don't have insurance.

14:16.506 --> 14:18.940
All right. We'll get to the bottom of this.

14:18.975 --> 14:20.809
- Sit tight.
- Thank you.

14:24.413 --> 14:26.781
35-year-old female,
unresponsive O.D.

14:26.815 --> 14:28.283
Two empty bottles of anti-depressants

14:28.317 --> 14:29.250
found on the scene.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.386
Start with the intubation.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.621
I screwed up, Tee. I got a simple G.S.W.

14:32.656 --> 14:33.822
I nearly killed the guy.

14:33.856 --> 14:35.691
Seen a million bullet
wounds. I should've known.

14:35.725 --> 14:37.826
Battlefield wounds, not civilian.

14:37.860 --> 14:38.860
They're very different.

14:38.895 --> 14:40.596
You spent six months as a war medic.

14:40.630 --> 14:44.265
That's not nearly long
enough to be a surgeon.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.767
Do the lavage now.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.502
To make matters worse, Jordan steps in,

14:47.536 --> 14:49.070
makes me look like a punk.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.706
You can't compare yourself to her.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.575
Jordan spent four years in residency

14:53.609 --> 14:55.042
in a Baltimore shooting gallery.

14:55.077 --> 14:56.611
That's worse than being in Fallujah.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.414
Jordan's the one I'd trust with my life.

15:00.949 --> 15:02.283
Okay. Great.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.386
So how's your first night
going as the big boss?

15:04.420 --> 15:07.088
Pretty good, you know?
They're a really great crew.

15:07.123 --> 15:10.291
Of course, T.C. drives me nuts,
but there's no shock there.

15:10.926 --> 15:12.927
Oh. You two don't get along?

15:12.961 --> 15:15.330
It's complicated.

15:15.364 --> 15:16.864
Sounds like an interesting story.

15:16.898 --> 15:18.566
Yeah, it's a long one.

15:20.602 --> 15:22.302
So...

15:22.337 --> 15:23.671
Breakfast, okay? We'll talk.

15:23.705 --> 15:26.540
- Great.
- All right.

15:27.575 --> 15:29.343
- Hey.
- Is there something you want?

15:29.377 --> 15:31.311
Topher said to get Kara,
the Janitor's daughter,

15:31.346 --> 15:32.546
some blood work and an M.R.I.

15:32.580 --> 15:34.048
But the tech says we can't get them now

15:34.082 --> 15:35.849
until we get approval from Ragosa.

15:35.883 --> 15:37.884
She might have a-a tumor.

15:37.919 --> 15:39.119
Yeah. Okay.

15:39.154 --> 15:41.689
- I'll take care of it.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

15:41.724 --> 15:44.891
If you take away our ability
to do the tests we need,

15:44.926 --> 15:46.493
we cannot diagnose our patients.

15:46.528 --> 15:47.994
Well, if the patient can't pay,

15:48.029 --> 15:49.696
then they get the minimum treatment.

15:49.730 --> 15:51.298
They just cost us too much money.

15:51.332 --> 15:53.066
Well, if all you care about is money,

15:53.100 --> 15:54.067
I can save you a ton.

15:54.101 --> 15:55.702
Just shut down the hospital.

15:55.736 --> 15:57.136
Then you won't have to treat anybody.

15:57.171 --> 15:58.338
Well, if we keep hemorrhaging losses,

15:58.373 --> 15:59.706
they will shut this place down.

15:59.741 --> 16:02.141
Oh, come on. We're the only
trauma unit for ten counties.

16:02.176 --> 16:03.076
Where will people go?

16:03.110 --> 16:04.245
It's just not the way
the corporation thinks.

16:04.246 --> 16:05.779
Well, that's how we think.

16:10.884 --> 16:13.153
Listen...

16:13.287 --> 16:14.954
You better change the way you think

16:14.988 --> 16:16.089
and start doing as I say.

16:16.123 --> 16:19.058
You see, I'm the guy
who can save this place.

16:19.093 --> 16:21.962
You're the guy who exposes
this hospital to a liability.

16:21.996 --> 16:23.162
If that tree trimmer died,

16:23.197 --> 16:24.864
do you know the lawsuit we'd be facing?

16:24.898 --> 16:27.500
So I should have just left
him to die out in the woods?

16:27.534 --> 16:29.768
Don't try to turn me into
some heartless bureaucrat.

16:29.803 --> 16:31.204
You don't know anything about me,

16:31.238 --> 16:33.406
and you broke every rule
pulling out that branch.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.841
Every legal rule, not medical.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.676
It's all the same thing now.

16:38.211 --> 16:40.613
This isn't some cash unit in Afghanistan

16:40.647 --> 16:41.913
where you're the God.

16:41.947 --> 16:43.448
You're on your last chance,

16:43.483 --> 16:46.318
so you either get in line,
or you are out of here!

16:50.323 --> 16:51.957
Don't threaten me.

16:51.991 --> 16:55.727
Get out of my way. I don't get intimidated.

17:05.905 --> 17:07.472
Oh, you see?

17:07.506 --> 17:09.040
You're not as tough as people said you...

17:09.074 --> 17:10.842
Uhh!

17:13.546 --> 17:14.811
T.C.

17:14.847 --> 17:16.981
Oh, he fell.

17:17.015 --> 17:18.415
Yeah. Okay.

17:18.849 --> 17:21.284
There's a multi-car
accident out in Kerr County.

17:21.318 --> 17:22.420
Topher needs you to go with him.

17:22.454 --> 17:23.654
Chopper's out in the lot.

17:23.688 --> 17:27.090
Okay, uh, just get him some
smelling salts. He'll be okay.

17:28.727 --> 17:30.161
Hey, buddy.

17:30.963 --> 17:32.696
They say it's a really bad one, Tee!

17:33.231 --> 17:35.266
Let's go! We gotta move it!

17:36.834 --> 17:39.403
We're taking off. 15 minutes out.

17:43.714 --> 17:44.814
The teenager said

17:44.848 --> 17:46.683
the pickup drove right into his lane!

17:46.717 --> 17:48.285
He's got minor lacerations!

17:48.319 --> 17:50.153
The other driver has broken ribs.

17:50.188 --> 17:52.822
We've got them covered!
It's the kid in the S.U.V.

17:52.856 --> 17:55.026
We didn't wanna move him.
That's why we called you!

17:55.027 --> 17:56.059
Help my brother!

17:56.060 --> 17:58.028
You have to help Matthew, please!

17:58.462 --> 18:01.731
All the doors are jammed!

18:01.765 --> 18:04.600
You gotta go through the sunroof.

18:05.636 --> 18:07.237
Hey, Matthew.

18:07.271 --> 18:09.739
Hey. I'm T.C. This is Topher.

18:09.773 --> 18:11.140
Okay, I know you're scared.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.409
We need you to be brave, all right?

18:13.444 --> 18:15.044
Move your fingers for me.

18:15.078 --> 18:17.847
Yeah? Hey, good job. Good job.

18:18.381 --> 18:20.983
Okay, we're gonna take care of you.

18:21.017 --> 18:21.952
So we're gonna get you out of here.

18:21.986 --> 18:24.019
Be right back. Pull me up.

18:24.054 --> 18:25.788
How bad?

18:25.823 --> 18:28.291
His skull is separated
from his spinal column.

18:28.326 --> 18:30.327
I can see 'em moving
separately with each breath.

18:30.361 --> 18:32.329
Oh, my God. How is he still alive?

18:32.363 --> 18:35.031
By some miracle, the skull
is being held in place

18:35.065 --> 18:35.899
by the neck muscles.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.434
But he's still got motor
activity in his extremities,

18:38.469 --> 18:41.003
so the spinal cord hasn't been severed.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.339
We need to sedate him
and get him out of here.

18:43.374 --> 18:44.340
He's got a chance.

18:44.375 --> 18:47.109
We need to fashion a mini body board

18:47.144 --> 18:48.110
to fit in there,

18:48.144 --> 18:49.111
and get some blankets.

18:49.145 --> 18:51.146
We need to... we need to improvise blocks

18:51.181 --> 18:53.449
to stabilize his head
and neck, okay? Let's go.

18:53.484 --> 18:56.485
Hey, hey, buddy. Hey.

18:56.519 --> 18:58.988
We're gonna take care of you.

18:59.122 --> 19:02.592
Oh, it smells like my grandma's house.

19:02.626 --> 19:04.226
No, I can't believe we have to do this.

19:04.460 --> 19:05.895
Hey, I did it all last year.

19:06.129 --> 19:07.563
State law. When an old fogey croaks

19:07.598 --> 19:10.066
at a nursing home, only an
M.D. can declare him dead.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.166
So they bring 'em here.

19:11.201 --> 19:13.135
Climb in. Check his
pulse. Takes two minutes.

19:13.169 --> 19:14.970
Let's go, before we
start getting busy again.

19:15.105 --> 19:16.772
Uh, hey, hey, wait. Wait. Um...

19:16.807 --> 19:19.474
I get to go first. Got
to do the stitches, so...

19:19.509 --> 19:20.776
Because you were afraid.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.677
I was... I was not afraid, all right?

19:22.712 --> 19:26.382
I was, uh, I was hesitant.
There's a difference.

19:27.551 --> 19:29.385
Okay.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.288
You're in there.

19:35.057 --> 19:36.958
Aah!

19:38.694 --> 19:42.631
Dude! Hey!

19:42.665 --> 19:44.633
You can open it.

19:48.304 --> 19:50.105
Hey! What is that?!

19:50.540 --> 19:52.641
That'd be your good friend Kenny.

19:54.010 --> 19:55.577
Yes.

19:56.746 --> 19:59.381
Yeah, I know it is.

20:03.685 --> 20:06.889
Whoa, whoa, where are you going?

20:06.923 --> 20:09.658
One of the admitting ladies
said they couldn't do the tests

20:09.692 --> 20:10.959
'cause I didn't have insurance.

20:10.993 --> 20:13.228
No, no, no.

20:13.263 --> 20:15.563
Topher told me you could
not leave, no matter what.

20:15.597 --> 20:16.898
If anybody comes up to you,

20:16.933 --> 20:19.233
you just start gagging like
you're gonna hurl all over 'em.

20:19.268 --> 20:21.703
Then run to the head
and hang out for a while.

20:21.737 --> 20:23.572
Can you do that?

20:23.606 --> 20:24.673
I think I can.

20:24.707 --> 20:26.741
It has to be good now.

20:26.776 --> 20:28.844
We hear people gagging all day long.

20:28.878 --> 20:30.545
Okay.

20:35.050 --> 20:37.552
Oh. Okay, stop, okay, stop, stop.

20:37.587 --> 20:38.920
That was really gross.

20:40.590 --> 20:42.457
Look, you'll be fine.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.192
Steady...

20:45.928 --> 20:47.729
Steady.

20:47.763 --> 20:49.530
Let's get him secured.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.100
Hey, hey, hey.

20:52.134 --> 20:54.168
Hey. If this kid slips a millimeter,

20:54.203 --> 20:55.636
he'll be paralyzed, okay?

20:55.670 --> 20:56.704
So no pressure, guys.

20:56.738 --> 20:58.206
Topher, here's nurse Ramos.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.276
Hey, Toph, our neurosurgeon is
in Houston doing an operation,

21:01.310 --> 21:03.277
but he'll be here as soon
as he finishes that surgery.

21:03.312 --> 21:05.580
Okay, good. Let's just hope
we can get the kid there.

21:05.614 --> 21:06.580
Crap. Topher.

21:06.615 --> 21:08.382
- Gotta go.
- His lung collapsed.

21:08.416 --> 21:11.218
I need a needle to reinflate.

21:33.341 --> 21:37.244
Ah, that was close. Just like old times.

21:37.278 --> 21:40.747
I got him. You're doing good, kid.

21:40.781 --> 21:42.783
We gotta get outta here
in the next 10 minutes!

21:42.817 --> 21:44.151
A storm is moving in.

21:44.185 --> 21:46.253
Okay. Let's do this.

21:46.287 --> 21:48.255
Doc, I gotta put something over you guys.

21:48.289 --> 21:49.924
There's gonna be Embers
flying all over the place

21:49.958 --> 21:51.158
when we cut this thing open.

21:51.192 --> 21:54.261
I gotta keep him still
and keep his lung inflated.

21:54.295 --> 21:56.563
Just put it over him.

22:31.319 --> 22:34.655
Dr. Ganote,
2-2-8-0.

22:34.689 --> 22:36.624
All right, everybody. Gather around.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.392
I got a few things to say.

22:38.827 --> 22:40.561
So I log on to the tablet program

22:40.595 --> 22:42.863
to see if any new
patients' names are entered,

22:42.897 --> 22:45.466
and I find the following names...

22:45.500 --> 22:47.835
Dick Hurtz.

22:47.870 --> 22:50.071
Anita Lay.

22:50.105 --> 22:51.605
Some young guy?

22:51.640 --> 22:52.706
Okay.

22:52.941 --> 22:54.408
Guys, you've had your fun,

22:54.443 --> 22:57.278
but come on. You have got
to take this seriously.

22:57.312 --> 22:59.547
It has made the day shift so much better.

22:59.581 --> 23:02.783
- It is amazing. Just... 
- Is it true that Ragosa fired T.C.?

23:02.817 --> 23:06.320
It's all over the 4th floor.

23:11.059 --> 23:12.125
What are we gonna do?

23:12.159 --> 23:13.760
You can't fire him,

23:13.795 --> 23:16.030
because medically speaking,
he is irreplaceable.

23:16.064 --> 23:18.265
Everybody can be replaced.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.968
Not T.C.

23:21.002 --> 23:22.569
Oh.

23:22.604 --> 23:25.738
I know him. Okay?

23:26.073 --> 23:28.341
I... I can turn him.

23:28.375 --> 23:30.810
I can get him in line.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.878
You just have to let me.

23:32.913 --> 23:34.314
This sounds like more

23:34.348 --> 23:36.050
than just a professional interest, Jordan.

23:36.084 --> 23:39.820
It's not. It's what best
for the trauma department.

23:39.854 --> 23:41.787
Well, I don't think so.

23:43.657 --> 23:46.092
He's out of here.

23:54.769 --> 23:58.104
Somebody get me a status on that surgeon!

23:58.139 --> 23:59.905
Callahan, you're fired!

23:59.940 --> 24:02.443
Get your things and get your
ass out of here in 10 minutes!

24:02.577 --> 24:03.977
Screw you, Ragosa!

24:04.011 --> 24:06.112
Did you approve that M.R.I. for me?!

24:06.147 --> 24:08.381
No! She has no insurance!

24:08.416 --> 24:11.417
I know she doesn't! That's
why I asked you to approve it!

24:11.452 --> 24:13.185
Take her to the clinic.

24:13.220 --> 24:15.988
She'll have to wait six months
if she goes to the clinic!

24:16.023 --> 24:17.424
She could be dead by then!

24:17.758 --> 24:21.627
Why is it so hard for
you people to understand

24:21.662 --> 24:23.964
that if we keep treating
everybody for free,

24:23.998 --> 24:25.765
we will go bankrupt?

24:26.299 --> 24:31.236
Because we're the ones dealing
with the people, not you!

24:31.271 --> 24:33.106
So, is, um, T.C. really gone?

24:33.141 --> 24:34.475
I don't know. I don't wanna think about it.

24:34.509 --> 24:37.176
Come on. Let's do this before
someone walks in on us, please.

24:38.545 --> 24:39.680
Clear.

24:41.182 --> 24:43.149
All right. There we go.

24:43.184 --> 24:44.717
Trust me. You don't want your first time

24:44.752 --> 24:45.818
being on someone who really needs it.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.019
- Paul, you're up.
- Wait. We don't...

24:47.054 --> 24:48.821
We didn't do things... 
things like this at Columbia.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.256
Yeah, well, not all of us could afford

24:50.291 --> 24:52.625
to go to the fancy med
schools. I went to U.S.H.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.227
Is that in the Caribbean?

24:54.261 --> 24:55.928
That'd be the Uniformed Services Hospital.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.063
It's for military. I was a medic.

24:57.098 --> 24:59.632
I was good at it, so the army
put me through med school.

24:59.667 --> 25:01.100
How long do you have to
serve to pay 'em back?

25:01.134 --> 25:02.635
I owe 'em 10 years, but I'm in it for life.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.169
No debt. I get to be a surgeon. Sweet deal.

25:04.204 --> 25:07.139
Paul, this guy's really dead, so hit him.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.809
So I hear you fight mixed martial arts.

25:09.843 --> 25:11.176
I love watching that.

25:11.211 --> 25:13.946
Yeah. I do it when I can. It's a fun hobby.

25:16.016 --> 25:17.783
Paul, come on. Now.

25:18.486 --> 25:21.120
- Clear.
- Clear.

25:21.454 --> 25:24.323
- Whoa! Watch it!
- Sorry. Sorry.

25:24.357 --> 25:25.391
Um, it's sorry.

25:25.425 --> 25:26.959
Ragosa nixed the M.R.I. for Kara.

25:26.994 --> 25:28.661
I don't have much time. I
need to know where she is.

25:28.696 --> 25:30.730
- Kenny's got her stashed in the head.
- Thanks.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.166
Hey, Dwayne.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.435
What do you want from me?

25:36.469 --> 25:37.469
Um, I need a favor.

25:37.504 --> 25:39.504
No kidding. You're talking to me.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.942
I-I need a scan for that girl over there.

25:42.976 --> 25:45.578
She doesn't have insurance.

25:46.512 --> 25:48.847
She might she might have a tumor.

25:48.881 --> 25:52.684
Hate to see a hot girl die.

25:52.719 --> 25:55.754
Okay, if I do this, you owe me.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.022
All right, whatever you want.

25:57.057 --> 25:58.457
Oh, I want liposuction,

25:58.491 --> 26:00.959
here, here, and here.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.195
Mm, dude, I'm not a plastic surgeon.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.463
But you know some.

26:04.497 --> 26:07.331
Get me the lipo, I'll get you the M.R.I.

26:08.802 --> 26:11.503
All right, just... just... don't do that.

26:12.739 --> 26:15.540
- $2,500 for lipo?
- It's a good deal.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.776
I'm not giving you 2,500
bucks. This girl could die.

26:17.810 --> 26:21.012
Have a heart. What... 
What else can I do for you?

26:21.046 --> 26:21.913
Oh! Spurs tickets.

26:21.947 --> 26:23.382
I already have courtside seats,

26:23.416 --> 26:26.217
and I make way more than
you, so you can't bribe me.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.152
But...

26:28.587 --> 26:32.791
You know that hot new
intern? Set me up with her.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.059
Krista?

26:34.093 --> 26:36.061
Yeah.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.929
She's way out of your league, man.

26:37.963 --> 26:39.497
I mean, let's start small.

26:39.531 --> 26:41.166
How about I buy you a blowup doll?

26:41.200 --> 26:43.601
Date with Krista or no lipo.

26:46.705 --> 26:47.972
Okay.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.208
This is kind of weird,

26:49.242 --> 26:51.209
but... but I'm just gonna spit it out.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.944
I need you to go on a
date with a plastic surgeon

26:53.978 --> 26:56.647
so he'll perform lipo on a M.R.I. tech

26:56.681 --> 26:58.149
who will then give Kara the M.R.I.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.351
to see if she has a tumor.

27:00.386 --> 27:01.986
You have to be kidding me.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.154
I-I wish I was,

27:03.189 --> 27:04.523
but I pretty much need to know right now

27:04.557 --> 27:06.658
if we're gonna get her in there.

27:06.692 --> 27:09.360
Wow. I am so glad I went to medical school.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.807
Hey, you got a second?

27:28.046 --> 27:29.947
So I heard it got...

27:29.981 --> 27:32.182
pretty hairy out there with the kid.

27:32.217 --> 27:34.218
Yeah.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.920
You know, when I saw his neck like that...

27:38.122 --> 27:39.089
Yeah.

27:39.123 --> 27:40.090
Yeah.

27:40.124 --> 27:42.792
I ever tell you about this, uh,

27:42.827 --> 27:45.162
this goofy soldier from Iowa

27:45.196 --> 27:46.864
named Bob Ropekee?

27:46.998 --> 27:48.031
No, I don't...

27:48.066 --> 27:50.234
- No?
- I don't think you did, no.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.938
He was in a Humvee accident near Kandahar.

27:54.973 --> 27:57.040
Same injury as this boy.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.308
I had to operate on him.

27:59.343 --> 28:01.745
- Are you
serious? - Mm-hmm.

28:01.779 --> 28:04.347
You did a spinal decapitation surgery

28:04.382 --> 28:06.316
in a tent?

28:06.350 --> 28:07.850
- Wow, I'm impressed.
- Yeah?

28:07.885 --> 28:10.720
Yes, I am, very.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.491
I really thought he was gonna make it.

28:21.941 --> 28:24.234
It was a hard letter
to write to his parents.

28:29.940 --> 28:33.776
'Cause I was the one driving the Humvee.

28:38.782 --> 28:39.982
Tee, I'm...

28:40.717 --> 28:42.050
I'm really sorry.

28:42.085 --> 28:43.820
No, I shouldn't have told you.

28:43.854 --> 28:44.888
Why?

28:44.923 --> 28:47.323
You know, I...

28:47.357 --> 28:49.658
I told you enough stories when I got back.

28:49.993 --> 28:51.660
You don't need to hear them.

28:53.396 --> 28:54.997
Look, Tee...

28:55.031 --> 28:58.667
I know we're not together anymore.

29:00.637 --> 29:01.937
but it doesn't mean

29:01.971 --> 29:04.339
that I've stopped caring about you.

29:07.209 --> 29:09.377
Guys, we got a drunk
driver, multiple M.V.A.

29:09.411 --> 29:10.245
five minutes out.

29:10.279 --> 29:11.347
Okay, I'll... I'll be right there.

29:11.481 --> 29:13.315
All right, looks like I'm up.

29:13.549 --> 29:15.216
Look, Tee, uh,

29:15.251 --> 29:17.252
about this whole Ragosa thing...

29:17.286 --> 29:19.420
Come on. Don't let it end this way.

29:19.455 --> 29:21.923
You need to apologize, all right?

29:21.957 --> 29:23.558
It's the only way...

29:23.592 --> 29:24.960
If you wanna stay.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.007
M.V.A.'s coming in. Triage up.

29:38.042 --> 29:40.009
Start two large bore I.V.s, wide open.

29:40.044 --> 29:43.113
Type and cross for 10 units.
We need 4 units of O-neg.

29:43.147 --> 29:44.880
This one is in bad shape.

29:44.915 --> 29:46.616
This one's mine. Topher, you're with me.

29:46.651 --> 29:47.618
T.C., the boy's coding.

29:47.652 --> 29:51.154
Jordan, I need you with me.
Drew, take the drunk driver.

29:51.188 --> 29:53.256
Topher, take the victim.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.491
This guy's a mess.

29:55.526 --> 29:57.994
Let's go, let's go. Recycle the pressure.

29:58.028 --> 29:59.829
Another 5-0 vicryl on a large needle.

29:59.864 --> 30:02.165
B.P.'s falling. 60 systolic.

30:02.199 --> 30:03.534
2 more units right now.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.001
Here you go. 2 units.

30:05.036 --> 30:07.804
He's gonna code.

30:08.438 --> 30:10.673
That's the brother of
the boy T.C. brought in

30:10.707 --> 30:11.807
by helicopter.

30:11.842 --> 30:13.409
He was the one who was driving.

30:13.443 --> 30:15.178
Poor thing is so upset.

30:15.612 --> 30:17.212
Thanks. I'll talk to him.

30:17.247 --> 30:19.082
Yeah. His mother's on the way.

30:19.116 --> 30:20.817
If his little brother doesn't recover,

30:20.851 --> 30:23.719
he may never get over the guilt of this.

30:25.622 --> 30:28.723
Unbelievable. This guy's
got a .38 alcohol level,

30:28.758 --> 30:30.392
creams another car,

30:30.426 --> 30:32.095
and he only ends up with a
black eye and a boo-boo neck.

30:32.129 --> 30:33.997
Get him to recovery.

30:35.732 --> 30:37.866
Time of death... 3:27.

30:42.872 --> 30:45.007
You did your best, Doctor.

30:49.279 --> 30:51.314
Damn drunk drivers.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.002
- Is this the drunk driver?
- Yep.

31:15.338 --> 31:16.772
Sir?

31:16.806 --> 31:19.174
- You with
me? - Mm-hmm.

31:19.208 --> 31:20.709
Oh. Oh, so... Oh, so you know

31:20.744 --> 31:23.579
that, um, this button in your hand controls

31:23.613 --> 31:26.048
the morphine from this machine
that's next to your bed.

31:26.082 --> 31:29.017
It's to... it's to help ease your pain.

31:30.286 --> 31:33.055
Button.

31:33.089 --> 31:35.057
Morphine.

31:35.091 --> 31:36.491
Pain.

31:38.961 --> 31:41.564
Tell them to prep the O.R. for the boy.

31:41.598 --> 31:42.397
Yes, Doctor.

31:42.432 --> 31:43.633
What's going on here?

31:43.667 --> 31:45.700
His bladder has emptied. He's
lost control of his extremities.

31:45.735 --> 31:46.635
We need to get him to the O.R.

31:46.670 --> 31:48.070
before the paralysis is permanent.

31:48.104 --> 31:50.839
The neurosurgeon isn't here
yet. He's still stuck in Houston.

31:50.874 --> 31:52.474
We can't wait. Just stay out of my way.

31:52.508 --> 31:53.575
I don't have time to explain

31:53.609 --> 31:55.477
how this operation works to you.

31:55.511 --> 31:58.112
We have major liability here, Jordan.

31:58.146 --> 32:00.281
Has T.C. ever performed
one of these before?

32:00.315 --> 32:02.050
Yes, in Afghanistan.

32:02.084 --> 32:03.184
And?

32:03.218 --> 32:04.319
He did it.

32:04.353 --> 32:05.953
Excuse me.

32:06.088 --> 32:08.590
Matthew was my responsibility.

32:08.624 --> 32:10.625
I was supposed to protect him,

32:10.659 --> 32:12.260
and now I might have
killed my little brother.

32:12.295 --> 32:14.162
Tommy, look at me.

32:14.497 --> 32:15.763
Look at me.

32:15.797 --> 32:17.932
Your brother is alive right now

32:17.966 --> 32:20.534
because of you.

32:20.568 --> 32:22.069
The deputy said that you would both be dead

32:22.104 --> 32:23.471
if the accident had been head on.

32:23.506 --> 32:26.274
Your reflex saved Matthew.

32:26.309 --> 32:28.843
And then despite being in shock

32:28.877 --> 32:31.445
and injured yourself, you
crawled to the highway,

32:31.479 --> 32:34.248
called
9-1-1.

32:34.282 --> 32:36.584
This was not your fault.

32:37.419 --> 32:39.653
Do you understand that?

32:39.790 --> 32:43.124
Look me in the eye and
tell me you understand.

32:45.395 --> 32:47.128
I understand.

32:47.162 --> 32:49.596
Honey?

32:49.631 --> 32:52.099
- Your mother's here.
- Tommy.

32:52.134 --> 32:54.302
Mom.

33:01.009 --> 33:03.310
Son of a bitch. This isn't working.

33:03.345 --> 33:04.312
We're not gonna be able

33:04.346 --> 33:05.980
to attach the skull to the neck bone.

33:06.014 --> 33:07.615
It'll take six screws.

33:07.649 --> 33:09.650
The cervical vertebra is fractured on the left side.

33:09.684 --> 33:11.585
There's nothing for
the screws to hold onto.

33:12.119 --> 33:15.222
What about the front of the neck?

33:15.356 --> 33:18.092
No. It's got a hairline
fracture there, too.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.160
The N20 is starting to fade.

33:20.194 --> 33:22.095
I don't know how much
more of this he can take.

33:22.129 --> 33:23.196
What are we gonna do?

33:23.230 --> 33:24.431
I don't know.

33:24.466 --> 33:25.899
You're going to need to attach

33:25.933 --> 33:27.901
the skull directly to the spine.

33:28.135 --> 33:29.735
What keeps it in place?

33:29.770 --> 33:31.104
A titanium loop.

33:31.138 --> 33:32.806
Use the wires to secure
it to the base of the skull

33:32.840 --> 33:35.175
and remove a piece of
his rib to fortify it.

33:35.209 --> 33:36.809
They've had success with the procedure

33:36.843 --> 33:38.311
at Barrow in Phoenix.

33:38.345 --> 33:40.813
I observed it at a
seminar there last spring.

33:40.848 --> 33:42.348
It will work.

33:42.382 --> 33:44.049
It's our best option.

33:47.187 --> 33:48.921
Ready, Doctor?

33:55.594 --> 33:57.494
Sweat.

34:03.001 --> 34:04.168
Almost done.

34:05.703 --> 34:09.873
I've attached the loop
to the spine and the wire

34:09.907 --> 34:11.742
to the skull.

34:11.775 --> 34:13.710
What's next?

34:13.745 --> 34:15.145
Very easy, Jordan.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.781
You're gonna need that piece
of rib to fortify the spine.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.684
- Very careful.
- I got it.

34:20.717 --> 34:22.485
The graft needs to be placed

34:22.518 --> 34:24.588
on each side of the spinous process

34:24.621 --> 34:26.389
between C1 and C2.

34:33.598 --> 34:36.000
Okay. The grafts are in position.

34:36.134 --> 34:38.001
Let's secure them and close.

34:46.574 --> 34:48.911
I'm still glad I hit him.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.980
I'm a little claustrophobic.

34:51.014 --> 34:52.748
It's gonna be okay, Kara.

34:52.783 --> 34:56.185
Just take a nap. Okay?
You need to be very still.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.987
We only have one shot at this.

35:04.127 --> 35:06.595
I'm afraid the test results
from our earlier appointment

35:06.630 --> 35:07.863
were not encouraging.

35:07.898 --> 35:10.433
Your vision is definitely deteriorating.

35:10.467 --> 35:13.303
When was the last time
you had corrective surgery?

35:13.337 --> 35:14.904
It's been a while.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.874
- Not since med school.
- Oh.

35:17.908 --> 35:19.575
You're an M.D., too?

35:19.709 --> 35:22.110
No, I had to quit.

35:24.014 --> 35:25.381
You really can't perform surgery

35:25.416 --> 35:27.517
when you can't see that well.

35:35.891 --> 35:37.092
Hey.

35:37.127 --> 35:38.426
Hey.

35:38.461 --> 35:39.795
So how's your boy doing?
Think he'll make it?

35:39.830 --> 35:42.130
Don't know. Have to wait for the swelling

35:42.165 --> 35:42.965
to go down first.

35:42.999 --> 35:45.401
- All right.
- How you doing?

35:45.436 --> 35:46.902
Doing great.

35:46.937 --> 35:48.638
You know that new intern Krista?

35:48.672 --> 35:50.673
- Yeah.
- Totally into me.

35:50.707 --> 35:52.340
I'm not gonna do anything about it, though.

35:52.375 --> 35:53.208
Don't worry. But...

35:53.242 --> 35:54.343
I mean, not that I wouldn't want to.

35:54.378 --> 35:57.079
She's pretty hot, right?
I'd love to hit that. But...

35:57.113 --> 35:58.981
Gray area in the workplace.

35:59.015 --> 36:00.616
Kinda confuses, crosses the line and such.

36:00.751 --> 36:02.352
- Drew.
- What?

36:03.586 --> 36:05.487
Do you really want me to say it?

36:05.521 --> 36:07.222
I have no idea what you're talking about.

36:07.557 --> 36:10.258
No one cares that you're gay.

36:10.293 --> 36:11.861
I'm not gay.

36:11.895 --> 36:15.197
Okay. Okay. Sorry I brought it up.

36:16.700 --> 36:19.468
But... you don't have to pretend with me

36:19.502 --> 36:21.403
if... you are pretending.

36:21.437 --> 36:23.070
Why would you even think that?

36:23.105 --> 36:25.273
You've been here over a year.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.609
Nobody's ever met your girl.

36:27.643 --> 36:29.645
Nobody's seen you with a girl.

36:29.679 --> 36:31.313
You've turned down a ton of other women,

36:31.347 --> 36:32.781
fix-ups from the other nurses.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.116
Now there's this hot new intern...

36:34.150 --> 36:35.484
Okay, okay, stop.

36:36.185 --> 36:38.787
Do you think anyone else thinks this?

36:38.822 --> 36:42.524
No... no, nobody's said
anything that I've heard,

36:42.558 --> 36:44.559
but maybe you should
think about coming out.

36:44.593 --> 36:46.561
No way. No.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.763
Are you insane?

36:48.798 --> 36:51.366
The second I come out, I am the gay guy.

36:52.868 --> 36:55.102
How many gay guys were in your ranger unit?

36:55.137 --> 36:57.238
Exactly.

36:57.272 --> 36:58.873
I love the Army, Tee,

36:58.907 --> 37:01.209
and I will not risk losing that...

37:01.243 --> 37:02.744
for anything.

37:03.579 --> 37:06.348
Coming out is not an option.

37:06.882 --> 37:08.883
Wow.

37:10.118 --> 37:11.886
That is so gay.

37:25.300 --> 37:26.668
Matthew.

37:27.302 --> 37:29.503
Can you hear me?

37:29.838 --> 37:32.040
Matthew, move your hand if you can hear us.

37:32.074 --> 37:33.640
Can you do that?

37:43.352 --> 37:45.319
Can you move your hand?

37:45.354 --> 37:47.788
Son?

37:56.564 --> 37:57.531
Oh.

38:04.838 --> 38:06.840
M-mom?

38:06.875 --> 38:09.911
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

38:09.945 --> 38:11.913
Thank you.

38:12.047 --> 38:13.146
Oh.

38:13.180 --> 38:16.650
It's gonna be okay.

38:21.590 --> 38:24.024
How amazing was that?

38:25.929 --> 38:27.762
Hey, how'd it go?

38:27.796 --> 38:29.997
It was unbelievable. Yeah? It worked.

38:30.031 --> 38:30.997
Kid got his feeling back.

38:31.032 --> 38:31.998
Thank God.

38:32.033 --> 38:34.400
Uh-oh. Yeah. Party's never over.

38:34.435 --> 38:36.136
I'll catch you guys later.

38:36.170 --> 38:38.238
So... I loved hearing from my new boss

38:38.272 --> 38:39.573
that I'm banging her ex.

38:39.607 --> 38:41.808
- Mm.
- Thanks for the heads up on that one.

38:41.843 --> 38:43.076
Well, um...

38:43.111 --> 38:46.879
And... here I thought you were a virgin.

38:47.917 --> 38:50.218
Day shift staff, report for duty.

38:50.253 --> 38:52.587
All day shift staff, report for duty.

38:53.521 --> 38:55.156
Am I pregnant?

38:55.190 --> 38:57.558
No. It... it's...

38:57.592 --> 39:01.761
You have a condition called fetus in fetu.

39:01.795 --> 39:04.164
It's gonna sound freaky,

39:04.198 --> 39:06.132
but you had a twin.

39:06.167 --> 39:07.300
A twin?

39:07.334 --> 39:12.072
Yes. At your conception or... or early on,

39:12.106 --> 39:14.640
your twin didn't develop,
but it stayed alive in a...

39:14.675 --> 39:17.277
In a very small tumor-sized form

39:17.311 --> 39:18.644
inside your body.

39:18.679 --> 39:20.680
So I'm not dying?

39:20.714 --> 39:21.847
No.

39:21.882 --> 39:23.583
You are not dying. In fact,

39:23.617 --> 39:26.052
the condition is so
rare, that the med school

39:26.086 --> 39:28.420
will do your operation for free.

39:28.455 --> 39:31.824
That's great. Thank you so much.

39:46.874 --> 39:50.109
I don't know if you heard,
but the boy pulled through.

39:50.143 --> 39:51.711
He's gonna be okay.

39:51.745 --> 39:53.879
That's good to hear.

39:55.015 --> 39:56.416
So...

39:56.450 --> 40:01.120
We should have a conversation
about what happened earlier.

40:01.154 --> 40:02.322
Yeah.

40:06.293 --> 40:08.093
Now we're even.

40:20.374 --> 40:22.774
Hey, guys. Look, I know
you're all off duty,

40:22.809 --> 40:27.178
and you just wanna relax after
a very hard night, but, um...

40:27.212 --> 40:28.447
I just wanna say thank you.

40:28.481 --> 40:30.382
You really pulled together tonight.

40:30.417 --> 40:31.683
What about T.C.?

40:31.718 --> 40:32.885
Anything new?

40:32.919 --> 40:34.520
I don't know.

40:34.554 --> 40:36.088
I tried to help, but I just...

40:36.122 --> 40:39.191
Well, speak of the devil.

40:39.226 --> 40:41.693
So, Tee, what's the news?

40:41.727 --> 40:44.796
Well, I had a meeting with Ragosa.

40:44.830 --> 40:47.433
We worked it out.

40:47.467 --> 40:48.767
I ain't going anywhere.

40:51.704 --> 40:53.405
- Thank you, Tee!
- Go, Tee!

40:56.809 --> 40:59.177
Is that a new bruise on your face?

I fell.

41:00.712 --> 41:02.981
Sure, you did.

41:03.015 --> 41:04.115
Jordan.

41:09.021 --> 41:10.755
What's this?

41:10.790 --> 41:13.191
Uh, the paperwork for your drug study.

41:13.225 --> 41:15.493
You did all this for me
after the night you've had?

41:15.527 --> 41:16.827
Yeah.

41:17.762 --> 41:20.164
Thank you.

41:20.198 --> 41:21.499
Ah.

41:26.138 --> 41:28.405
Welcome to the night shift, Jordan.
