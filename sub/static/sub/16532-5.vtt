WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:04.430
Great.
The karaoke machine.

00:04.450 --> 00:05.600
Thanks, Uncle Mitch.

00:05.620 --> 00:07.130
It's Cam's, and he loves it.

00:07.150 --> 00:09.100
He's never more
than two glasses of wine away

00:09.120 --> 00:11.170
from treating us all
to an impromptu concert.

00:11.190 --> 00:12.910
It's 100 bucks if you break it.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.680
Really?
Do you want more?

00:14.700 --> 00:17.350
Who's America's favorite TV mom?

00:17.370 --> 00:19.150
Could it be June...

00:19.170 --> 00:20.350
Cleaver?

00:20.370 --> 00:21.950
That must make me the Beaver.

00:21.970 --> 00:24.350
I can't hear too well.
How hard is Luke laughing?

00:24.370 --> 00:25.590
Don't waste this gold on me.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.020
Get over
to the Hendersons' party,

00:27.040 --> 00:30.090
put your keys in a bowl,
do the Hustle.

00:30.110 --> 00:31.460
Relax.

00:31.480 --> 00:32.630
Your uncool parents

00:32.650 --> 00:34.090
aren't gonna hang
around your party

00:34.110 --> 00:35.430
and make it all lame.

00:35.450 --> 00:38.330
Of course not.
Hey.

00:38.350 --> 00:41.600
I just heard a story about a kid
who had an unsupervised party

00:41.620 --> 00:43.940
and one of the guests
broke his leg

00:43.960 --> 00:45.840
because he jumped
off the roof onto a trampoline

00:45.860 --> 00:47.040
and sued the parents.

00:47.060 --> 00:48.840
We have a trampoline.
And a roof.

00:48.860 --> 00:50.110
I need to know
that you're joking.

00:50.130 --> 00:52.210
Mom, I have everything
under control.

00:52.230 --> 00:54.280
Claire, come on!

00:54.300 --> 00:56.280
He's a responsible young man!

00:56.300 --> 00:58.550
Have a little faith in your son.

00:58.570 --> 01:00.190
These are
all the emergency numbers.

01:00.210 --> 01:02.190
That's Fire, Police,
Poison Control,
Homeland Security.

01:02.210 --> 01:03.820
You're in charge.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.790
I mean, unless you...
happen to have other plans.

01:05.810 --> 01:07.830
Yeah, let's just pretend
I partied too hard last night.

01:07.850 --> 01:08.900
You're an animal.

01:08.920 --> 01:09.960
Ugh!
Hmm?

01:09.980 --> 01:11.300
Dang it!
What's wrong?

01:11.320 --> 01:12.470
Is this flower straight?

01:12.490 --> 01:13.870
I don't know.
Oh!

01:13.890 --> 01:16.300
Halloween prank!

01:16.320 --> 01:18.040
That's payback from last year.

01:18.060 --> 01:19.640
A Pritchett
always pays his debts.

01:19.660 --> 01:21.380
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.910
The Friedmans' pool party.

01:22.930 --> 01:24.810
That's what I say.

01:24.830 --> 01:27.050
What is...
Classic.

01:27.070 --> 01:28.820
The old fly
in the plastic ice cube gag.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.720
Very funny!
Very...

01:30.740 --> 01:31.820
No!

01:31.840 --> 01:33.350
Ha, ha!

01:33.370 --> 01:35.020
You're melting!

01:35.040 --> 01:37.190
You're melting!

01:37.210 --> 01:39.730
I did the ice cube.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.900
Well, now you're the one
who's wet.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.030
Not really.
Most of it's on the floor.

01:44.050 --> 01:46.000
Phil, are you okay?

01:46.020 --> 01:47.600
I'm fine. Yeah.

01:47.620 --> 01:49.400
Hey, you know
what the Beaver said

01:49.420 --> 01:50.910
when he slipped in water?

01:50.930 --> 01:52.410
Damn it?
Damn it.

01:52.430 --> 01:55.600
♪ ♪

02:05.370 --> 02:08.729
Jay, as a Catholic,
I do not feel right about this.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.500
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.830
It's the perfect family costume.

02:12.850 --> 02:15.970
It doesn't even make sense.
Joe should be the Jesus.

02:15.990 --> 02:17.240
Yeah!

02:17.260 --> 02:18.740
"Joe"
short for "Joseph."

02:18.760 --> 02:21.040
"Jay"
short for "Jaysus."

02:21.060 --> 02:23.010
It's the only way
it makes sense.

02:23.030 --> 02:24.550
But he's the child.

02:24.570 --> 02:25.850
You're overthinking it.

02:25.870 --> 02:27.750
Huh?
You get who this is, right?

02:27.770 --> 02:28.770
Harriet Tub Man?

02:29.870 --> 02:31.210
Oh, Joyce Carol Floats.

02:32.670 --> 02:34.660
Farrah Faucet,
spelled F-A-U...

02:34.680 --> 02:35.890
Yeah, I get it.

02:35.910 --> 02:37.390
And why are you
only guessing women?

02:37.410 --> 02:39.660
I'm Dalton Trumbo,
blacklisted screenwriter,

02:39.680 --> 02:41.230
wrote in a bathtub.

02:41.250 --> 02:42.700
I'm a little worried that
because of the movie,

02:42.720 --> 02:44.260
a lot of people
will have this costume.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.330
I think you're good.
Nobody going to Luke's party

02:46.350 --> 02:48.100
will ever be able
to figure out that costume.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.100
Yeah, that's why I'm going
to a different party.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.510
You're not skipping Luke's party
to go to someone else's.

02:52.530 --> 02:54.410
There's going to be
a million people at Luke's.

02:54.430 --> 02:56.410
He's not going to care
whether or not I attend.

02:56.430 --> 03:00.110
Manny, is this because Luke
beat you for class president?

03:00.130 --> 03:03.580
Why can't you get over
this devastating humiliation?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.190
Because something
keeps me reminding me.

03:05.210 --> 03:06.590
But it has nothing to do
with that.

03:06.610 --> 03:07.890
Sophie Chambers
is throwing a party

03:07.910 --> 03:09.520
with a much more
sophisticated crow...

03:09.540 --> 03:11.630
You're not going to any party
thrown by any member

03:11.650 --> 03:13.860
of that crooked
Earl Chambers' family.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.860
That bastard stole my closet
company right out from under me!

03:16.880 --> 03:18.530
No, no, no, no, no.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.640
Don't say the word "bastard"
when you're dressed like Jesus!

03:20.660 --> 03:22.740
And you...
Never turn your back on family.

03:22.760 --> 03:25.970
My cousin Gomez skipped
my other cousin Gomez's party,

03:25.990 --> 03:29.380
and my cousin Gomez felt
completely stabbed in the back.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.210
Because he...
Because he was.

03:31.230 --> 03:34.050
Come on. The party's going to be
at Sophie's grandpa's mansion.

03:34.070 --> 03:35.820
It's the social event
of the season.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.150
- You're going to Luke's!
- That's not fair!

03:38.170 --> 03:40.050
You heard your mother!
You're going to Luke's!

03:40.070 --> 03:41.790
You're going to Earl's.
What?

03:41.810 --> 03:43.590
You're gonna put dead fish
in his shoes.

03:43.610 --> 03:45.930
And I'm gonna cover for you
if your mother gets suspicious.

03:45.950 --> 03:47.060
Where am I going to hide fish?

03:47.080 --> 03:48.150
You're in a bathtub!

03:49.920 --> 03:51.770
Happy Halloween!
Thank you.
Happy Halloween.

03:51.790 --> 03:53.170
They just took one,
right?
Yes.

03:53.190 --> 03:54.940
How much candy
do we have to hand out

03:54.960 --> 03:56.440
before I go
trick-or-treating?

03:56.460 --> 03:58.070
Can't I just take a knife
and go by myself?

03:58.090 --> 03:59.070
No!

03:59.090 --> 04:00.700
No one would mess with me.

04:02.430 --> 04:04.750
I told you she was too young
for "West Side Story."

04:04.770 --> 04:06.910
Hmm.
W-What are you doing?

04:06.930 --> 04:09.080
What? It's my one and only
candy bar for the night.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.590
No more Snickers.

04:10.610 --> 04:12.320
If you don't want to hear
any more snickers

04:12.340 --> 04:14.690
then don't pretend
that's your last candy bar.

04:14.710 --> 04:17.630
Cam doesn't react well to candy.

04:17.649 --> 04:21.800
Which is why I never eat it.
Except on Halloween.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.500
And I admit, in years past,
I may have overindulged.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.100
Which leads to a crazy high

04:26.120 --> 04:29.300
followed by a tearful,
self-loathing crash.

04:29.320 --> 04:32.010
To Days of Red Vines and Roses.

04:32.030 --> 04:33.510
Trick or treat!

04:33.530 --> 04:35.460
Yep, just take one.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.210
I know that laugh.
Not this year.

04:39.230 --> 04:40.210
Drop it.

04:40.230 --> 04:41.380
You're crazy.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.850
Yeah, crazy for justice!

04:42.870 --> 04:44.150
And just because
you're dressed like a villain

04:44.170 --> 04:45.390
doesn't mean
you have to act like one!

04:45.410 --> 04:47.190
Oh, my God.
Can you believe that?

04:47.210 --> 04:48.390
Yes, a 9-year-old kid

04:48.410 --> 04:49.560
wanting extra candy
on Halloween.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.130
Oh, it is baffling.

04:51.150 --> 04:52.960
Speaking of 9-year-olds
wanting candy on Halloween...

04:52.980 --> 04:54.190
Okay, just a second, honey.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.730
Cam, maybe grabbing a kid's arm

04:55.750 --> 04:57.300
is where we draw the line.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.170
I think I read that
in every single law book.

04:59.190 --> 05:01.300
This sounds like something
we could be talking
about on the sidewalk.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.840
Okay, just a second, honey.
You know what, Mitchell?

05:03.860 --> 05:06.970
That same little jerk grabs
a handful of candy every year.

05:06.990 --> 05:08.580
He's my Halloween nemesis.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.710
There is a social contract.

05:10.730 --> 05:12.710
You say "trick or treat,"
you get one piece of candy.

05:12.730 --> 05:15.220
That breaks down, we're
just a hop, skip, and a jump

05:15.240 --> 05:19.250
to a lawless wasteland where we
use beads and teeth for money!

05:19.270 --> 05:20.760
That was your first candy bar,
you say?

05:20.780 --> 05:22.260
You think maybe
you should have a little protein

05:22.280 --> 05:23.260
to balance that out?

05:23.280 --> 05:24.730
I don't need any protein.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.330
Oh!

05:26.350 --> 05:28.200
I feel like the universe
is telling you differently.

05:28.220 --> 05:29.380
Who did that?!

05:31.020 --> 05:33.530
He went that way! Past all
the houses handing out candy!

05:33.550 --> 05:35.290
I'm on it!

05:36.720 --> 05:38.270
No, see, his name is Joe.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.710
Yeah, but wouldn't the child
be Jesus?

05:40.730 --> 05:42.710
I got to take this.

05:42.730 --> 05:44.550
Tell her what we're doing
with this.

05:44.570 --> 05:46.050
My husband is going to hell

05:46.070 --> 05:47.920
and he's trying
to take us with him.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.170
Hello?

05:50.200 --> 05:51.420
Okay, I'm in Earl's bedroom.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.850
Do you want me
to show you his shoes

05:52.870 --> 05:54.590
so you can pick which ones
I shove fish into?

05:54.610 --> 05:56.390
Follow your heart, kid.
Wait a minute. What's that?

05:56.410 --> 05:57.630
What?

05:57.650 --> 05:59.130
That picture
on the wall behind you.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.380
What is that?
Let me see it.

06:02.950 --> 06:05.100
David Soul played Hutch
in "Starsky and Hutch."

06:05.120 --> 06:07.300
Now, one of my groovier
closet ideas

06:07.320 --> 06:08.800
was a hutch for your skis

06:08.820 --> 06:11.310
that latched onto the end
of your closet.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.240
I called it
the "Storeski End Hutch."

06:13.260 --> 06:15.110
David Soul gave me
a signed picture.

06:15.130 --> 06:16.910
Well, one day,
the picture disappears

06:16.930 --> 06:18.150
and Earl plays innocent.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.210
But the whole time, he's had it.

06:20.230 --> 06:21.880
Ironically, this would've been

06:21.900 --> 06:24.080
a great episode
in "Starsky and Hutch."

06:24.100 --> 06:25.150
Steal that picture!

06:25.170 --> 06:26.390
But what about the fish?

06:26.410 --> 06:27.420
Forget the fish!

06:27.440 --> 06:28.920
Oh, so, for no reason,

06:28.940 --> 06:30.320
I've just been carrying around
this red herring?

06:30.340 --> 06:31.550
I want that picture.

06:32.610 --> 06:34.390
You want it, you steal it.

06:34.410 --> 06:35.920
I still have
some self-respect.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.570
Gloria, you won't believe this.

06:40.590 --> 06:42.670
- What?
- That was Claire.

06:42.690 --> 06:44.770
Manny never showed up
at Luke's party.

06:44.790 --> 06:46.470
They think he went to Sophie's.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.140
So disappointed in him.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.110
I know, and I hate
to drive over there

06:50.130 --> 06:51.480
and drag him to Luke's,

06:51.500 --> 06:53.610
but I know better
than to try to stop you.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.280
I feel bad
about embarrassing him,

06:55.300 --> 06:56.850
but I was very clear about this.

06:56.870 --> 06:59.070
Well, maybe next time
he'll... get the picture.

07:00.310 --> 07:01.990
Why did you just chuckle
like that?

07:02.010 --> 07:03.090
Nothing.
The... The beard tickles.

07:03.110 --> 07:04.280
Come on, I'll drive.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.270
Here you go.
Sorry I forgot that, buddy.

07:12.290 --> 07:13.430
I would have grabbed it myself,

07:13.450 --> 07:14.530
but we were trying to respect

07:14.550 --> 07:16.100
the whole "no parents" thing.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.370
Also, how would it look
if I went into your party

07:17.390 --> 07:19.140
looking for some tail?

07:19.160 --> 07:20.540
I'm gonna reuse that later.
Act surprised.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.980
Yeah.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.340
Hey, honey.
How's it going in there?

07:23.360 --> 07:25.280
Huh? Oh. Awesome.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.010
Yeah, I got to go.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.820
I know you were going to say

07:28.840 --> 07:31.050
that I'm being a neurotic,
overly protective mom, but I...

07:31.070 --> 07:32.320
I saw that, too.
Something's up with Luke.

07:32.340 --> 07:33.650
You think he's in over his head?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.060
I should check on him.
Should I check on him?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.560
I should check on him.

07:36.580 --> 07:40.460
You are never sexier
than when you out-crazy me.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.060
Don't let anyone see you.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.380
I am way a...

07:44.920 --> 07:46.320
head of you.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.340
Aah!

07:54.360 --> 07:56.310
Shh! I'm not a real beaver!
It's me... Dad!

07:56.330 --> 07:57.980
Ugh.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.680
What are you doing?

07:59.700 --> 08:01.150
I just wanted to make sure
everything's okay.

08:01.170 --> 08:03.050
Luke seems upset.

08:03.070 --> 08:04.380
Where is everybody?

08:04.400 --> 08:06.920
Are people upstairs?
I said nobody upstairs!

08:06.940 --> 08:08.820
Nobody's upstairs.
Nobody's even downstairs.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.930
They are literally
like five people here.

08:11.950 --> 08:12.930
Oh!

08:12.950 --> 08:14.700
Hello, my dearest.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.230
Ugh.
Well, four, and Reuben.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.600
I see your costume

08:17.620 --> 08:19.530
is The Most Beautiful Woman
in the World.

08:19.550 --> 08:21.170
Shut up, Reuben.
You make everything terrible.

08:21.190 --> 08:22.870
And we're off.

08:22.890 --> 08:24.240
Don't flatter yourself!

08:24.260 --> 08:25.740
Just because
I'm alone on Halloween

08:25.760 --> 08:27.540
doesn't mean
I don't have plenty of suitors!

08:27.560 --> 08:31.080
Last week, an Uber driver
asked to see my feet!

08:31.100 --> 08:33.510
Reuben, are you listening
to me?!

08:33.530 --> 08:34.740
Reuben!

08:35.400 --> 08:36.679
One last one.
Good.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.190
'Cause you're vibrating
right now.

08:38.210 --> 08:41.220
With rage...
Not sugar, rage.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.559
Hello.
Excuse me. Hi.

08:43.580 --> 08:45.760
Have you seen a little brat
about this tall

08:45.780 --> 08:47.130
dressed as Darth Vader?

08:47.150 --> 08:48.430
Throws eggs.
Laughs like this...

08:48.450 --> 08:49.700
He-he-he-he-he-he!

08:49.720 --> 08:52.130
Find him yourself.
You're Batman.

08:52.150 --> 08:54.100
That one's on my list.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.800
I don't think
there's any more room.

08:55.820 --> 08:57.370
I'm gonna go throw away
these apples

08:57.390 --> 08:58.810
and make space for more candy.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.280
Cam, I feel terrible
that you got hit with an egg,

09:01.300 --> 09:03.280
but you're ruining the night
for Lily.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.410
Do you have to nurse
every single grudge?

09:05.430 --> 09:06.980
I don't do that.
Are you kidding me?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.250
You have more archenemies
than the actual Batman.

09:09.270 --> 09:11.890
How about that sales lady
who helped you with the scarf?

09:11.910 --> 09:14.050
She implied my neck
was the problem.

09:14.070 --> 09:15.660
The Spanish teacher
you've been working with?

09:15.680 --> 09:16.960
He calls me "locos frijoles"

09:16.980 --> 09:18.430
like I don't know
what that means.

09:18.450 --> 09:19.960
It's "crazy beans,"
right?
Yes, it is.

09:19.980 --> 09:21.800
Oh, and don't forget about
Andrew from your old choir.

09:21.820 --> 09:23.460
He stole my piano key scarf,
which is why I had to go

09:23.480 --> 09:24.730
into the stupid scarf store
to begin with!

09:24.750 --> 09:26.270
Okay, you know what?

09:26.290 --> 09:29.440
Maybe I do have an overdeveloped
sense of justice.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.140
Thank you.
But maybe I wouldn't...

09:31.160 --> 09:34.440
if my partner took my side
every once in a while.

09:34.460 --> 09:36.240
I take your side
when I agree with you.

09:36.260 --> 09:38.750
That's easy.
Anybody can do that.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.920
Marriage is about sticking up
for your partner,

09:40.940 --> 09:43.350
even... when you don't agree
with him.

09:43.370 --> 09:44.580
Is it?

09:44.600 --> 09:45.750
Do you remember last week
at lunch

09:45.770 --> 09:47.290
when they brought you
regular fries

09:47.310 --> 09:50.160
and you insisted that you
ordered sweet potato fries?

09:50.820 --> 09:52.160
Well, guess what.

09:52.540 --> 09:53.580
You ordered regular fries.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.560
No, I didn't.
You absolutely did.

09:55.580 --> 09:57.830
And I stuck up for you
because I love you.

09:57.850 --> 10:00.230
And because you love
sweet potato fries.

10:00.250 --> 10:01.400
Hey, Dad.
What?

10:01.770 --> 10:03.470
There's that kid you hate.

10:04.900 --> 10:06.950
Holy Halloween.
There he is.

10:06.970 --> 10:09.790
Hey! You! Stop!

10:09.810 --> 10:11.120
No.

10:11.140 --> 10:14.390
♪ ♪

10:14.410 --> 10:16.630
He's getting away!

10:16.650 --> 10:19.370
Ow!

10:19.390 --> 10:20.870
Stupid cape!

10:20.890 --> 10:24.700
Oh, poor Luke.
He must be crushed.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.310
It's not as easy to pack
a high-school party

10:26.330 --> 10:27.810
as it was in our day, Claire.

10:27.830 --> 10:29.110
Apparently, it's no longer cool

10:29.130 --> 10:31.410
for kids to invite
teachers or parents.

10:31.430 --> 10:32.610
It makes my heart hurt.

10:32.630 --> 10:34.380
I mean, people like him,
don't they?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.780
Why wouldn't they?

10:35.800 --> 10:37.650
He's by far the most likable
of all our children.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.790
Then why didn't anybody
come to his party?

10:39.810 --> 10:41.620
Because they're all
at Sophie Chambers' party.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.220
Who?
A kid in Luke's class.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.560
I'm Facebook friends
with her brother

10:44.580 --> 10:47.130
'cause he used to sell me
wee-gs. Wigs.

10:47.150 --> 10:48.800
That's how he pronounces it.
He's British.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.760
When are you guys
gonna talk, huh?

10:50.780 --> 10:52.170
Luke worked so hard
on this party.

10:52.190 --> 10:54.130
He made his own costume,
did all the decorations.

10:54.150 --> 10:55.570
He even thought he hid
that bottle

10:55.590 --> 10:57.100
of Peppermint Schnapps
under his bed.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.470
This is the kind of thing

10:58.490 --> 11:00.070
that could ruin
his first senior year.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.010
Wait! I can help!

11:02.030 --> 11:04.410
Are we forgetting
what I do for a living? Huh?

11:04.430 --> 11:06.410
Uh, we remember.

11:06.430 --> 11:08.650
You... pretend to be friends
with celebrities.

11:08.670 --> 11:11.320
So you can sell
h... hats?

11:11.340 --> 11:12.770
I'm a promoter.

11:13.970 --> 11:16.190
I can go to Sophie's
and talk up Luke's party.

11:16.210 --> 11:18.160
In an hour,
it'll be packed.
Great!

11:18.180 --> 11:19.430
While you do that,

11:19.450 --> 11:20.590
I'm gonna get the party started.

11:20.610 --> 11:22.160
What... No, no.

11:22.180 --> 11:23.800
A dad hanging around
will only make that party lamer.

11:23.820 --> 11:25.870
Um, a dad, maybe.

11:25.890 --> 11:28.640
But not Rod Skyhook, yo!

11:28.660 --> 11:30.640
The coolest
new transfer student ever!

11:30.660 --> 11:31.940
Oh, wait.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.870
What do cool kids
call girls nowadays?

11:33.890 --> 11:35.170
Bettys? Shawties?

11:35.190 --> 11:36.340
Don't worry.
There are none in there.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.540
Okay.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.500
What, what?

11:40.230 --> 11:45.180
♪ Doobie, doobie, do, ba

11:45.200 --> 11:46.520
♪ Doobie, doobie

11:46.540 --> 11:48.220
I'm glad my hypoglycemia

11:48.240 --> 11:50.820
doesn't prevent me
from filling up on eye candy.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.830
Sorry.
I can't hear you.

11:51.850 --> 11:53.330
I'm listening to a message

11:53.350 --> 11:55.230
from the sexiest professor
in the physics department.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.330
Let's just say he got drunk
after a symposium last year

11:57.350 --> 11:59.750
and asked me to wheel him home.

12:01.820 --> 12:04.070
Thanks for inviting me
to your party, brah!

12:04.090 --> 12:07.140
Sweet jams.
Where are all the fillies at?!

12:07.160 --> 12:08.580
Dad?
Dad?

12:08.600 --> 12:11.510
I'm Rod Skyhook...
Recent transfer student, yo!

12:11.530 --> 12:12.880
What's that knockin'?

12:12.900 --> 12:17.180
Oh, it's me,
about to get this party rockin'!

12:17.200 --> 12:18.590
Oh, God.

12:18.610 --> 12:22.560
It's all good
up under the hood, biznatches!

12:22.580 --> 12:24.990
Pretty soon, every kid in here's
gonna call everyone they know,

12:25.010 --> 12:26.360
tell them
to get their butts down here.

12:26.380 --> 12:27.660
You want to gas up
the foot traffic...

12:27.680 --> 12:28.700
I'm not inviting parents.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.060
Your party, broseph!

12:30.080 --> 12:31.770
Sorry, Jack.

12:31.790 --> 12:34.890
I'm gonna need some beats!

12:47.470 --> 12:48.750
Rambo?

12:48.770 --> 12:50.220
No, Trumbo.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.590
Dalton Trumbo.
He wrote in the bathtub.

12:52.610 --> 12:53.720
Why?

12:53.740 --> 12:55.220
Maybe, as a screenwriter,

12:55.240 --> 12:57.280
he knew he was going
to take a bath on the back end.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.610
You smell like fish.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.230
Oh, my God, you guys.
This party's such a snore.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.430
I should have stayed
at Luke Dunphy's party.

13:05.450 --> 13:06.970
That was going off!

13:06.990 --> 13:08.430
Isn't he the guy that ate
a jar of mayonnaise

13:08.450 --> 13:09.600
for a dollar?

13:09.620 --> 13:11.200
Probably 'cause he's a wild man.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.110
That's why his parties
are always insane.

13:13.130 --> 13:14.640
Look, it's really exclusive,

13:14.660 --> 13:16.940
but I could probably
get you guys down on the list.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.380
Really?
Who's there?

13:18.400 --> 13:21.920
Uh, just everyone.
Luke... Rod Skyhook.

13:21.940 --> 13:23.120
Haley D!

13:23.140 --> 13:24.120
Oh!

13:24.140 --> 13:26.320
Griffin. Hey.

13:26.340 --> 13:27.890
What are you doing
at my sister's party?

13:27.910 --> 13:30.160
Oh, nothing. Just...
Just something for my mom.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.890
Wow, it's so good to see you.

13:31.910 --> 13:33.930
You, uh, still
in the sales industry?

13:33.950 --> 13:35.290
Guilty.

13:35.310 --> 13:37.230
How guilty?
That is a costume, right?

13:37.250 --> 13:40.470
Yeah. I went legit.
I work for a dispensary.

13:40.490 --> 13:41.400
I deliver.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.840
Oh, my God!

13:42.860 --> 13:45.060
I forgot how much I like you.

13:46.130 --> 13:47.310
Did you say Dumbo?

13:47.330 --> 13:49.310
No, Trumbo.
Little background.

13:49.330 --> 13:52.250
In the 1950s, a certain senator
from Wisconsin

13:52.270 --> 13:53.580
named Joe McCarthy...

13:53.600 --> 13:54.680
Hey! Let's dance!

13:54.700 --> 13:55.800
Oh, okay.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.360
Mom?

14:03.380 --> 14:05.290
You said that you
were going to Luke's.

14:05.310 --> 14:06.490
Yeah, but Jay said...

14:06.510 --> 14:09.300
Don't you say a word, mister!

14:09.320 --> 14:11.870
I will deal with you later.

14:11.890 --> 14:13.500
Jay said I could come
to the party

14:13.520 --> 14:15.130
if I put dead fish
in Earl's shoes.

14:15.150 --> 14:16.870
Where does he come up
with this stuff?

14:16.890 --> 14:20.170
Are you lying,
dressed as our Lord and Savior?

14:20.190 --> 14:22.510
What is that?
Did you steal that?

14:22.530 --> 14:24.780
No. I've had this with me
all night.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.150
You're lying again!

14:26.170 --> 14:28.310
Manny, don't stand next to him!

14:28.330 --> 14:29.320
Pritchett!

14:29.340 --> 14:30.350
Ay!
Aah!

14:30.370 --> 14:31.890
Look what you did!

14:31.910 --> 14:33.820
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

14:33.840 --> 14:35.290
We're just leaving, Earl!

14:35.310 --> 14:37.360
That Soul is mine.

14:37.380 --> 14:38.880
Ay!

14:43.420 --> 14:44.730
Give it back!
When hell freezes over!

14:44.750 --> 14:46.470
Come here, Earl!
Come here!

14:46.490 --> 14:48.870
As soon as they stop fighting
about whatever stupid new thing

14:48.890 --> 14:50.300
that they're fighting about,

14:50.320 --> 14:52.070
we're getting the car
and we're going to Luke's.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.070
I'm not really in the mood
for another party.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.710
Well, I wasn't in the mood
to insult God tonight,

14:56.730 --> 14:59.210
but the Bible also said,
"Listen to your husband."

14:59.230 --> 15:01.410
I'm very tense about this,
so don't fight me!

15:01.430 --> 15:02.420
And get in the car.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.880
I won't fit in.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.750
We'll take this bathtub
and put it in the roof.

15:05.770 --> 15:07.650
No. I won't fit in
at the party.

15:07.670 --> 15:09.160
Nobody gets me, Mom,

15:09.180 --> 15:10.920
and I'm starting to worry
nobody ever will.

15:10.940 --> 15:13.430
Who cares that the kids your age
don't get you?

15:13.450 --> 15:16.060
That means that you're
more interesting than them.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.730
That means that you're gonna be
hanging around people

15:17.750 --> 15:19.000
that are more interesting.

15:19.020 --> 15:20.230
You're gonna have
a more inter...

15:20.250 --> 15:21.740
Interesting life.
Yes, I know.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.400
I've been hearing this speech
since I was 5.

15:23.420 --> 15:24.670
When's it gonna happen?

15:24.690 --> 15:27.010
Jesus has the devil
in a headlock.

15:27.030 --> 15:28.270
That's not interesting to you?

15:28.290 --> 15:30.110
No!

15:30.130 --> 15:31.580
This is mine!

15:31.600 --> 15:33.850
I'm the one who came up
with "Storeski End Hutch."

15:33.870 --> 15:36.450
Just like I came up with the
"Dr. Quinn Medicine Cabinet."

15:36.470 --> 15:39.110
You were the hack!
I was the visionary!

15:40.410 --> 15:42.290
I saw my reflection
and I asked myself...

15:42.310 --> 15:44.220
What would Jesus do?

15:44.240 --> 15:46.610
It's time to be the bigger man.

15:48.150 --> 15:49.860
This isn't over, Pritchett.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.870
I don't want to do this anymore.

15:51.890 --> 15:53.230
Wh... What
are you saying?

15:53.250 --> 15:56.240
This has gone on too long.
The lies, the anger.

15:56.260 --> 15:57.940
And what I left
in your sock drawer tonight.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.240
What?

15:59.260 --> 16:02.430
Keep the picture, Earl.
I forgive you.

16:04.460 --> 16:07.230
It's gonna drive
that son of a bitch crazy.

16:09.570 --> 16:10.920
Haley.

16:10.940 --> 16:12.720
I have been waiting
for over an hour,

16:12.740 --> 16:14.720
and not a single person
has left this party.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.460
Oh, my God, this is
the best sushi I've ever had.

16:17.480 --> 16:20.090
For the first time,
I can taste the yellowtail

16:20.110 --> 16:22.130
from the sea
and then the rice from the land,

16:22.150 --> 16:24.260
then back to the sea
for the seaweed.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.230
Looks like you did more
than just seaweed.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.330
Mom, you're beautiful.

16:28.350 --> 16:30.300
Does Dad tell you that enough?

16:30.320 --> 16:31.940
I would hate to see

16:31.960 --> 16:34.970
a cleaver in your head
for real.
No. Honey.

16:34.990 --> 16:36.980
Sarah?
Mrs. Dunphy.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.410
Is that a beer?

16:38.430 --> 16:40.910
It's not mine.
Please don't tell my parents.

16:40.930 --> 16:42.920
That's when I realized

16:42.940 --> 16:45.120
I didn't need Haley
to undermine a party.

16:45.140 --> 16:48.860
I just needed
to drop the Mom-bomb.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.990
Don't you two look cozy.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.510
Remember, it's not easy
raising a baby by yourself.

16:56.220 --> 16:57.760
Oh, look at that!

16:57.780 --> 16:59.430
That's a fun way
to serve Jell-O.

16:59.450 --> 17:01.030
Let me get a pic for your moms.

17:01.050 --> 17:02.920
No? Come on!

17:05.490 --> 17:06.670
Okay. Ooh!

17:06.690 --> 17:08.339
Isn't that better?

17:08.359 --> 17:10.140
Now we can all see
and hear each other.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.339
Nice, huh?

17:11.359 --> 17:12.849
You got a little something...

17:12.869 --> 17:14.609
Who are you, and what are you
doing at my party?

17:14.630 --> 17:18.650
Just making sure everybody's
having a good, clean, safe time.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.950
Somebody's talked to you all
about herpes, right?

17:20.970 --> 17:22.819
Let's just go
to that other kid's party.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.890
You know, I made out
with Rod Skyhook once.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.010
He's obsessed with me.

17:29.820 --> 17:31.730
Hey, remember last week when
we all had lunch together...

17:31.750 --> 17:34.630
You ordered the regular fries
and Daddy lied for you.

17:34.650 --> 17:35.470
Damn it.

17:35.490 --> 17:36.970
Wait. There he is.

17:36.990 --> 17:40.040
Darth Vader! Freeze!

17:40.060 --> 17:41.670
Okay.

17:41.690 --> 17:44.860
♪ ♪

17:45.900 --> 17:47.150
Hey, there, fellas.

17:47.170 --> 17:48.650
You're a little old, aren't you?

17:48.670 --> 17:51.150
Your son...
He hit me with an egg.

17:51.170 --> 17:54.250
No, I didn't!
And he yelled at me.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.560
Whoa, whoa.
You yelled at my son?

17:56.580 --> 17:59.190
He took a handful of candy
and laughed.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.530
He does it every year.

18:00.550 --> 18:01.490
So?

18:01.510 --> 18:02.550
So...

18:04.450 --> 18:06.070
how does it feel?

18:06.090 --> 18:09.340
Well, it feels like you took
about 17 cents worth of candy.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.910
He said he didn't egg you.
Are we done here?

18:11.930 --> 18:14.010
- He's lying.
- No, I'm not.

18:14.030 --> 18:15.610
Look, buddy.
I don't know who egged you,

18:15.630 --> 18:17.210
but I can understand why.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.210
A kid takes a little extra candy
and you chased him home?

18:20.230 --> 18:21.380
He's 9.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.480
How old are you, Batman?
50?

18:23.740 --> 18:24.940
What kind of person does that?

18:25.740 --> 18:28.420
I will... I will tell you
what kind of person.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.960
Someone who believes
in a civilized society,

18:30.980 --> 18:32.630
who believes that the future
of our country

18:32.650 --> 18:36.460
depends on the lessons
that we teach our children.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.700
"What kind of person," sir?

18:39.720 --> 18:41.270
A hero.

18:41.290 --> 18:42.570
I didn't do it!

18:42.590 --> 18:44.640
Oh, come on.
We heard you laughing!

18:44.660 --> 18:46.810
'Cause the blonde lady
with an axe in her head

18:46.830 --> 18:47.940
threw an egg at you.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.780
Blonde lady?
Axe?

18:49.800 --> 18:52.710
That squirting flower
really yanked my chain.

18:52.730 --> 18:56.640
Could not go unanswered.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.250
Oh! Close enough.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.610
Who did that?!

19:03.840 --> 19:05.140
He went that way!

19:05.910 --> 19:07.960
Well, that was embarrassing.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.660
No, it wasn't.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.560
It was magnificent.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.630
You stood up for me.

19:13.650 --> 19:16.100
Sometimes
I just feel like it's me
versus the entire world.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.670
It's just nice to know
that we really are a...

19:18.690 --> 19:20.640
a dynamic duo.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.440
All right.
Now we play candy crash.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.910
Okay.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.270
Give me some space, son.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.780
That's how we do, sucka!

19:42.120 --> 19:43.460
Is it just my imagination,

19:43.480 --> 19:45.330
or is Dad actually saving
your lame party?

19:45.350 --> 19:47.000
Is it just my imagination,

19:47.020 --> 19:49.140
or is Reuben's makeup
on your chin?

19:49.160 --> 19:51.290
I have a problem.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.210
Oh! Sorry.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.380
Oh, okay.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.880
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.850
This is the most a girl's
danced with me all night.

20:05.870 --> 20:08.650
I love your Dalton Trumbo.

20:08.670 --> 20:10.690
Thank you, Dorothy Parker.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.190
You're the first person tonight
who's actually gotten that.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.890
I know how that feels.

20:14.910 --> 20:16.330
Yo, yo, yo!

20:16.350 --> 20:19.130
Awesome rager
on the ground floor!

20:19.150 --> 20:20.700
Upstairs off-limits!

20:20.720 --> 20:24.170
Backyard, too,
'cause it just got re-sodded!

20:24.190 --> 20:25.570
What's up, buddy?

20:25.590 --> 20:27.810
Typical high-school idiot.

20:27.830 --> 20:30.080
I fear for this country.

20:30.100 --> 20:33.580
Well, I think it's safe to say
that things here

20:33.600 --> 20:36.180
are appropriately
out of control.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.920
Oh, yeah... Oh, wow.

20:37.940 --> 20:40.820
And I think you might have
lost your deposit on that thing.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.420
Hmm.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.390
How come you never tell me
I'm beautiful anymore?

20:45.410 --> 20:47.060
- Oh!
- Damn it.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.080
Oh, just let me throw already.

20:54.290 --> 20:55.930
Hey, gorgeous. Look what
I turned this water into.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.500
Jay, enough.
Halloween is over.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.670
Come on. The night is young.
Why don't we go begat it on?

21:00.690 --> 21:03.680
I'm not going to fool around
with someone dressed like Jesus.

21:03.700 --> 21:04.880
Gloria, you're being silly.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.280
Am I?

21:06.300 --> 21:08.450
I once dated a guy named Jésus.

21:08.470 --> 21:10.580
There was no harvest that year.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.120
Is that the same year
your uncle got drunk

21:12.140 --> 21:13.420
and planted marbles?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.220
Who do you think
made him do that?

21:15.240 --> 21:16.790
Gloria, all due respect,

21:16.810 --> 21:18.360
I think the big guy
has better things to worry about

21:18.380 --> 21:19.650
than two sexy, you know...

21:22.750 --> 21:25.420
I'm gonna change into something
a little more secular.
