WEBVTT

00:02.363 --> 00:03.455
Hey, Molly.

00:03.564 --> 00:07.227
Dupree, what are you doing?
Carl asked me to fill in.

00:07.302 --> 00:09.736
I guess there was
some sort of work conflict.

00:09.804 --> 00:12.466
What? Conflict?
What kind of conflict?

00:12.573 --> 00:14.268
I don't know.
I don't ask questions.

00:14.342 --> 00:16.435
I just ride
to where I'm needed.

00:16.544 --> 00:20.139
But don't worry. I'm sort
of a good public speaker.

00:20.248 --> 00:23.547
Oh, no, no. It's a Career Day presentation,
Dupree. You don't even have a job.

00:23.618 --> 00:26.416
I understand that. But here's
what I'd love you to do.

00:26.487 --> 00:29.581
Please get Mandy here.
I want her to see this.

00:29.657 --> 00:31.557
I think this will
win her back.

00:31.626 --> 00:33.617
Now where are these
little rug rats?

00:33.728 --> 00:35.821
They're in the third door.

00:37.632 --> 00:39.429
Hey, how are you?

00:39.500 --> 00:42.765
First of all, thank you for
giving me the opportunity

00:42.837 --> 00:44.771
to come talk to you
on Career Day.

00:44.839 --> 00:47.933
Now, I am not
Mr. Carl Peterson

00:48.676 --> 00:50.610
and I don't have
a career per se.

00:50.678 --> 00:54.444
I guess you could say my
career is living and loving.

00:54.515 --> 00:56.813
And I do that to the utmost.

01:00.488 --> 01:01.955
She coming?

01:02.824 --> 01:04.587
Keep going? Okay.

01:05.193 --> 01:07.684
I see all you
fresh-faced kidlets,

01:07.795 --> 01:12.027
sitting there in your neat little
rows, and you're all just pods.

01:12.133 --> 01:14.533
Pods, waiting
for your instructions.

01:14.635 --> 01:17.297
Now some of you are
gonna get zapped right away

01:17.372 --> 01:19.636
and be 15-year-old prodigies,

01:19.707 --> 01:24.110
little midget Olympic gymnasts
with their pictures on cereal boxes.

01:24.512 --> 01:27.174
Some of you will go on to college,
and you'll find your rhythm there,

01:27.281 --> 01:29.545
and then go chase down
the titans of industry,

01:29.650 --> 01:32.141
or maybe straighten out
our problems at the UN.

01:32.220 --> 01:33.482
But some of you,

01:33.554 --> 01:37.650
and this is the group that no one ever
comes into Career Day and addresses,

01:37.725 --> 01:39.124
and it's criminal,

01:39.193 --> 01:42.219
some of you are
just gonna float along,

01:43.498 --> 01:45.193
eating spicy foods,

01:45.299 --> 01:48.496
humming black people's music
into your 30s.

01:48.569 --> 01:51.163
Well into your 30s,
languishing.

01:51.239 --> 01:54.868
This group of pods is gonna
do a lot of languishing.

01:54.976 --> 01:57.911
And you're gonna
take some heat for it.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.040
Sadly, you will.

02:01.149 --> 02:05.085
Europe's a little easier. They
seem to understand a little better.

02:05.186 --> 02:07.416
So does South America.

02:07.522 --> 02:09.183
I went to Argentina one time,

02:09.257 --> 02:13.023
and everyone just seemed to be
sitting around. It was beautiful.

02:13.094 --> 02:16.188
But that's okay.
You stay loose. Stay liquid.

02:16.330 --> 02:18.924
Laugh a lot. But be ready.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.660
That's what Dupree's doing
with his life's little pod.

02:21.736 --> 02:25.502
Staying nimble. Till I get
the call from the mother ship.

02:25.907 --> 02:27.602
My raison d'état.

02:28.176 --> 02:29.370
Then I'd fight.

02:29.444 --> 02:34.404
Then you'll see Dupree coming in here
throwing seven different kinds of smoke.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.793 --> 02:48.887
That's fine. The pods that
were supposed to hear this did.

02:48.963 --> 02:52.455
It'll kick in when it
needs to. I'm done here.

02:55.169 --> 02:57.467
I told you. Now, do you
think it went over their head?

02:57.572 --> 03:00.336
No. It was really good.
They got it. They got it.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.909
Now, where's Mandy? I'm only
gonna do this one more time,

03:02.977 --> 03:04.308
but we got to get her here!

03:04.412 --> 03:07.472
Dupree, Mandy has to...
She had a...

03:07.582 --> 03:10.517
She had a book
that was lost.

03:17.658 --> 03:19.592
I'm sorry, Dupree.

03:28.035 --> 03:30.526
Dupree, wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

03:30.638 --> 03:34.267
Dupree, there's something
you need to know about Mandy.

03:35.877 --> 03:40.473
Well, it turns out that she's a total slut
and is sleeping with half the male faculty.

03:41.549 --> 03:44.177
What? No.
I'm sorry.

03:44.285 --> 03:45.980
My Mandy?
Yeah.

03:46.521 --> 03:48.682
Sorry, Dupree.
I would have never set you up

03:48.789 --> 03:50.450
with her
if I would have known.

03:50.525 --> 03:52.993
Ever. Okay, kids, back inside.

03:53.528 --> 03:55.223
Let's go.
Ever.

04:05.306 --> 04:06.898
With that guy?

04:07.008 --> 04:10.136
Great job today,
kids. Yeah. Good teamwork.

04:10.478 --> 04:13.345
You did good,
Billy. All right, let's go.

04:13.681 --> 04:17.139
Yeah. All right, let's get
ready for the next class.

04:29.363 --> 04:30.762
Afraid so.

04:30.998 --> 04:33.262
He's not even on the faculty.

04:34.602 --> 04:38.902
There really aren't any more Audrey
Hepburns out there, are there?

04:39.273 --> 04:41.070
Oh, what a sucker.

04:44.212 --> 04:47.739
Dupree? Dupree?

04:52.019 --> 04:54.852
You talk to Sam
about the zoning issues?

04:55.756 --> 04:58.953
Yeah. And to be honest with
you, sir, they're still in flux.

04:59.060 --> 05:02.894
Carl, I'm going to the bank in days,
all right? I cannot have things in flux.

05:02.964 --> 05:05.398
I realize that, sir.
I'll get on it right away.

05:05.466 --> 05:08.299
Carl, sit down, please.
Please just sit down.

05:10.371 --> 05:12.362
You know, there's
something you said to me

05:12.440 --> 05:15.273
a few days ago that I just
cannot get out of my mind.

05:15.376 --> 05:20.075
Something about you and
Molly having children.

05:20.748 --> 05:24.115
Oh, right. Yeah, no. That
was... That was hypothetical.

05:24.218 --> 05:28.484
That's not something that we're
talking about doing any time soon.

05:28.589 --> 05:32.218
You know what I did, Carl,
when I started dating again?

05:32.393 --> 05:34.418
No idea.
I got a vasectomy.

05:34.495 --> 05:36.326
A vasectomy?
Yeah.

05:37.498 --> 05:39.762
Okay. That's a little
extreme, don't you think?

05:39.834 --> 05:42.826
Not really. It's a mild
outpatient procedure.

05:42.937 --> 05:44.905
A little local anesthesia,
snip snip,

05:44.972 --> 05:47.566
sit on a bag of frozen peas
for a night. Voilà.

05:47.642 --> 05:50.076
I mean, that was it,
and it's

05:54.649 --> 05:56.981
one hundred percent effective.

05:57.418 --> 05:59.909
Yeah.
And 1000% permanent.

06:00.755 --> 06:04.623
Carl, read the literature.
It is reversible.

06:05.259 --> 06:09.355
Seventy percent of the time. All right.
See you get your shit together, all right?

06:09.463 --> 06:12.660
I want it back on my desk, this
zoning stuff, by 3:00 today.

06:12.767 --> 06:15.463
All right?
Thank you, Carl.

06:22.476 --> 06:23.875
All right?

06:24.612 --> 06:26.170
WOMAN ON TV.. Fine. How are
you? "Fine. How are you?"

06:26.280 --> 06:27.611
Oh, fine.

06:29.617 --> 06:31.608
MAN ON TV.. Say, you know,
you were great back there.

06:31.686 --> 06:33.984
You weren't so bad yourself.

06:49.303 --> 06:52.568
MAN ON TV.. Guess we'd better get
Irving's car and get out of here.

06:52.673 --> 06:55.506
So you really were serious
about Audrey Hepburn, huh?

06:55.576 --> 06:59.808
She had it all. Style,
grace, ethereal beauty.

07:02.216 --> 07:04.548
Just like I thought Mandy did.

07:05.886 --> 07:08.354
I don't know. I have a hard
time imagining Audrey Hepburn

07:08.422 --> 07:11.653
getting buttered up
to Funky Cold Medina.

07:12.259 --> 07:14.489
Really? I don't.

07:15.162 --> 07:19.064
The Mouth of Truth. The legend
is that if you're given to lying

07:19.166 --> 07:21.896
and you put your hand in
there, it will be bitten off.

07:22.002 --> 07:25.699
I'm still trying to understand
why Carl didn't show up today.

07:26.207 --> 07:29.199
I know he's under a lot
of pressure right now,

07:29.276 --> 07:31.540
but just lately he seems
like a different person.

07:31.612 --> 07:35.605
No, he's just working really
hard. He gets like that sometimes.

07:36.784 --> 07:39.582
Maybe if he opened up
a little bit more.

07:40.287 --> 07:43.518
Look, Carl's never gonna be
mistaken for the great communicator.

07:43.591 --> 07:46.754
I mean, just mention the word
"feelings" or "emotion,"

07:46.861 --> 07:49.125
and you watch his eyes
glaze over. But...

07:49.230 --> 07:51.528
I don't know.
He just puts up a wall.

07:51.599 --> 07:53.191
Well, how do you get past it?

07:53.267 --> 07:56.134
I think you just fight
through it. Patience.

07:56.237 --> 07:59.263
That's what I did.
I ask a lot of questions.

07:59.373 --> 08:01.102
I let him know that I care.

08:01.208 --> 08:04.473
And I just pray he drops his
guard, 'cause when he does,

08:04.578 --> 08:06.307
it's so worth it.

08:12.486 --> 08:13.714
Hello.

08:13.788 --> 08:16.279
You beast!
It was perfectly awful!

08:16.390 --> 08:19.621
That gets me every time,
and I know it's coming.

08:31.439 --> 08:33.873
So, Dupree did a good job?

08:34.875 --> 08:36.365
Did he mention
the mother ship?

08:36.477 --> 08:39.969
Actually, in a weird way,
he was really inspiring.

08:40.548 --> 08:43.448
I didn't know he was so sensitive.
Did you know he writes poetry?

08:43.517 --> 08:45.178
Poetry?
Yeah.

08:45.286 --> 08:47.277
Man, what a homo.
Wow.

08:47.855 --> 08:50.722
That is really mature, Carl.

08:52.526 --> 08:54.619
Look, honey, I'm sorry
I didn't make it today.

08:54.695 --> 08:58.153
What is going on with you
lately? Oh, nothing. I'm fine.

08:58.232 --> 09:00.462
You are clearly
not fine, Carl.

09:00.534 --> 09:02.798
So why don't you meet me
halfway here, please.

09:02.870 --> 09:05.134
All right. You want to
know what's going on?

09:05.206 --> 09:07.538
I'll tell you
what's going on.

09:07.842 --> 09:10.470
I think your father hates me.
What?

09:11.245 --> 09:14.908
Carl. Carl, my father
does not hate you.

09:15.082 --> 09:16.640
He gives you
this big promotion,

09:16.717 --> 09:18.048
which you said
was a dream come true.

09:18.152 --> 09:19.642
Why would he do that?
Because he hates you?

09:19.720 --> 09:22.553
That's exactly
what I'm beginning to think.

09:22.656 --> 09:24.317
For the same reason
he's been systematically

09:24.391 --> 09:26.655
trying to emasculate me
and sterilize me.

09:26.727 --> 09:29.059
Slow down. 'Cause now you're
not making any sense.

09:29.163 --> 09:30.323
I'm not making any sense?

09:30.397 --> 09:33.389
Well, here's something that
should make perfect sense to you.

09:33.501 --> 09:36.527
Now, everybody knows that your
father, when he likes somebody,

09:36.604 --> 09:38.595
he invites them out
on a little fishing trip.

09:38.706 --> 09:41.937
Fact. I've never been
invited fishing. Not once.

09:43.043 --> 09:45.910
You hate fishing.
He doesn't know that.

09:46.847 --> 09:49.042
I'm telling you, Molly,
he hates me.

09:49.116 --> 09:53.450
Look, Carl, I know how my
father gets sometimes. I do.

09:54.088 --> 09:56.249
He pushes people
when he wants results.

09:56.357 --> 09:58.723
And it's frustrating,
I know.

09:59.426 --> 10:01.451
But he doesn't hate you.

10:01.896 --> 10:04.558
And I know you want to do
a great job on this project,

10:04.632 --> 10:07.066
but it's taking over
your life.

10:07.935 --> 10:10.563
And we're supposed
to be having fun.

10:13.374 --> 10:16.138
Why don't you come home at
a decent hour tomorrow night?

10:16.243 --> 10:18.541
Dupree wants to cook for us.

10:18.812 --> 10:20.803
We'll sit down,
we'll have dinner, relax.

10:20.915 --> 10:23.440
Talk about things
other than work.

10:25.119 --> 10:26.848
And everything
will be okay.

10:26.921 --> 10:28.855
Yeah.
You'll see.

10:28.923 --> 10:30.117
Fine.

10:31.525 --> 10:32.719
Fine.

10:43.604 --> 10:44.798
Yeah.

10:47.641 --> 10:48.801
Hey.

10:50.210 --> 10:51.768
You busy?
No.

10:51.845 --> 10:54.541
Just catching up
on some back issues.

10:55.149 --> 10:56.810
What's going on?

10:58.919 --> 11:00.910
I wanted to ask you something.

11:00.988 --> 11:02.148
Yeah?

11:03.157 --> 11:06.558
Would you be offended if Thompson
asked you to get a vasectomy?

11:06.627 --> 11:09.892
What? Why would he want me
to get a vasectomy?

11:09.964 --> 11:12.330
Carl, I barely know the man!
Wait a minute! Wait! Dupree.

11:12.433 --> 11:15.425
Yes, I'd be offended!
No. Not you.

11:15.502 --> 11:18.938
That's not what I mean. Just
what do you think of vasectomies?

11:19.006 --> 11:21.770
Cutting off my manhood?
I think it's barbaric.

11:21.842 --> 11:25.642
No one's getting near that
part of my body. No one, Carl.

11:25.746 --> 11:27.941
Unless, of course,
it's a woman.

11:28.015 --> 11:30.813
And then she better
not have a scalpel.

11:31.185 --> 11:32.584
Of course.

11:33.487 --> 11:35.648
Why would he want me
to get a vasectomy?

11:35.756 --> 11:37.280
He doesn't want you
to get a vasectomy.

11:37.358 --> 11:39.622
It was a hypothetical question. Okay.

11:39.693 --> 11:40.955
Just forget I asked.

11:41.028 --> 11:42.359
Don't joke with me
like that, man.

11:42.463 --> 11:44.522
Go back to your reading.

11:52.306 --> 11:54.501
Watch that heat.
Slow stirring, Molly.

11:54.608 --> 11:56.872
How are my game hens doing?

11:56.977 --> 11:58.171
Wow.
Gorgeous.

11:59.113 --> 12:01.547
Okay, get started on the
salad. Put some walnuts in.

12:01.615 --> 12:04.379
I'll take care of this. Okay.
How'd you learn all this?

12:04.451 --> 12:08.717
Most of it I picked up in a six-week
series, Treasures of Tuscany.

12:08.989 --> 12:13.153
The garlic technique, however,
I got from watching Goodfellas.

12:13.227 --> 12:14.888
I actually make
an incredible risotto,

12:14.995 --> 12:17.657
but I want to keep it
low carb tonight for Carl.

12:17.731 --> 12:21.189
Poor guy has kind of let the
wheels come off a little bit. Okay.

12:21.301 --> 12:22.859
Twenty minutes
till the big guy gets here.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.562
Focus. We got to
come together now.

12:24.672 --> 12:27.664
Merlot. I want you to get
it out. Get it breathing.

12:27.741 --> 12:32.201
We're gonna use the 2005, Napa
wine glasses Aunt Kathy gave us.

12:32.846 --> 12:36.475
How did you know Aunt Kathy
gave us those wine glasses?

12:37.551 --> 12:39.917
He would have written
these notes. Dupree, please!

12:40.020 --> 12:41.920
Please stop making
excuses for him. I'm not.

12:42.022 --> 12:44.013
But I think that he would
have if he... No, you are.

12:44.091 --> 12:46.719
And you have to stop doing that now
because your buddy is wrong. Okay?

12:46.827 --> 12:50.763
If he didn't want to write them,
he should have just told me.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.831
And, big surprise,
he's late again.

12:58.906 --> 13:01.500
Look, you know, forget him.

13:01.575 --> 13:04.009
You made this beautiful meal.
Thank you.

13:04.078 --> 13:06.103
We're gonna sit here
and we're gonna enjoy it.

13:06.213 --> 13:08.078
We're gonna drink.

13:09.283 --> 13:12.582
And we're gonna eat. And
we're gonna drink some more.

13:12.686 --> 13:14.677
Well, it's frustrating
for me, too,

13:14.755 --> 13:17.883
'cause I know he would have
loved this meal.

13:28.635 --> 13:29.795
Yeah.

13:32.139 --> 13:33.868
I can't do it...

13:34.441 --> 13:35.772
Oh, boy.

13:36.610 --> 13:39.374
No. But I used to be able to
touch it to the top of my nose.

13:39.446 --> 13:42.438
No, really? Yeah. Oh,
wow. Can you do it?

13:42.549 --> 13:43.573
No.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.455
Hey, guys.

13:55.496 --> 13:58.124
There's a plate
for you in the oven.

13:59.967 --> 14:02.834
Okay, look,
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

14:03.437 --> 14:05.337
I got hung up at work.

14:06.774 --> 14:09.937
Would it have killed you
to make a phone call?

14:10.177 --> 14:11.906
No, Randolph, Randolph, wait!

14:11.979 --> 14:13.446
I'm sorry, Molly, but,

14:13.514 --> 14:17.006
damn it, Carl, you really
press my buttons sometimes!

14:19.520 --> 14:22.751
Is he kidding? No. Now
you've upset Randolph.

14:25.793 --> 14:27.158
Randolph?

14:27.961 --> 14:31.328
Randolph? You got to be kidding
me. I know a Randy Dupree.

14:31.431 --> 14:33.422
I do not know a Randolph.
Did it ever occur to you

14:33.500 --> 14:35.263
that maybe he prefers
to be called Randolph?

14:35.335 --> 14:37.132
No, Molly,
it never occurred to me.

14:37.204 --> 14:39.195
You know, the guy writes
some bullshit poetry

14:39.306 --> 14:41.536
and suddenly he's
got a brand-new name.

14:41.642 --> 14:44.202
That's funny. Turns out that's
not the only thing he writes.

14:44.311 --> 14:47.803
Apparently, he is a whiz
at thank-you notes!

14:51.819 --> 14:55.152
He told you about that?
It just kind of slipped out.

14:55.389 --> 14:58.153
Oh, I bet it just
kind of slipped out.

14:58.792 --> 15:02.785
Guy stabs his best friend in the
back. He's getting drunk with his wife.

15:02.863 --> 15:06.230
What can I say, Carl? I'm
kind of fun to get drunk with.

15:06.333 --> 15:09.302
Maybe you should try it sometime,
because I'm here every night!

15:09.369 --> 15:12.964
Molly, I'd be delighted to try it
sometime, but unlike your friend, Dupree,

15:13.040 --> 15:14.701
I've got a job!

15:14.808 --> 15:17.333
And what was with
the groomsman shirt?

15:17.411 --> 15:18.776
That was a one-time deal,
Molly.

15:18.846 --> 15:20.438
He was trying to
look nice for you.

15:20.514 --> 15:22.311
And why are you
coming down on Dupree?

15:22.382 --> 15:25.146
He's the one who went through all
this effort to cook low carb for you.

15:25.219 --> 15:26.481
You didn't even
bother to show up.

15:26.553 --> 15:28.020
Low carb?
What the hell does that mean?

15:28.088 --> 15:31.990
You know, he's on the whole health kick
with the bicycling and Lance Armstrong.

15:32.059 --> 15:35.153
So he's just trying to help you
out. He's trying to help me out?

15:35.229 --> 15:36.491
That's a laugh, Molly.

15:36.563 --> 15:39.862
I'm the one who put
a goddamn roof over his head!

15:40.367 --> 15:43.234
One. We put the roof
over his head.

15:43.337 --> 15:46.738
And A. I mean, you haven't really
been taking care of yourself.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.365
I can't remember
the last time you exercised.

15:49.476 --> 15:52.343
And how many Twinkies
have you had today?

15:53.680 --> 15:54.874
What are you talking about?

15:54.982 --> 15:56.574
Oh, Carl, please.
There's, like,

15:56.650 --> 15:59.744
a million Twinkie wrappers
on the floor of your car.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.681
You're not fooling anybody.
All right. All right.

16:02.756 --> 16:04.781
So I admit it,
I enjoy one occasionally.

16:04.858 --> 16:07.326
Is there something
so wrong with that?

16:07.394 --> 16:10.420
And, Molly, look, I am
under a great deal of stress.

16:10.530 --> 16:12.589
What do you want from me?

16:17.004 --> 16:20.599
Wait a minute. Is this the
kind of thing that turns you on?

16:20.674 --> 16:22.699
Oh, Carl!
Is this what turns you on?

16:22.776 --> 16:26.234
Come on, Molly. I was
reading an article on Oprah.

16:26.947 --> 16:30.439
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I can't be one
of your boy-band flavor of the weeks.

16:30.550 --> 16:33.178
With their enhanced
frosted tips

16:33.253 --> 16:37.212
and their washboard bellies
and their hairless backs!

16:40.060 --> 16:41.960
What's happening to us, Carl?

16:42.062 --> 16:46.863
I don't know what's happening to you,
Molly, but apparently I'm getting fat!

16:52.205 --> 16:56.642
Nice. Looks like somebody's tired
of getting sand kicked in their face.

16:56.743 --> 16:59.371
Good job. Good to see you
living strong, buddy.

16:59.446 --> 17:02.074
Please. Would you
listen to yourself?

17:02.149 --> 17:05.949
You get your first ten-speed bike,
and suddenly you're Lance Armstrong.

17:06.053 --> 17:07.452
Let's leave
Lance out of this.

17:07.554 --> 17:10.717
Guy's done more with one testicle
than you and I can do with three.

17:10.790 --> 17:13.589
Now, listen. I know you're
under a lot of pressure at work

17:13.660 --> 17:15.491
and you and Molly
are having some trouble.

17:15.595 --> 17:17.256
Trouble? No.

17:17.497 --> 17:21.092
I wasn't having any trouble
until you arrived, Randolph.

17:21.167 --> 17:23.102
What's that supposed to mean?
You know what it means.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.329
No, I don't.

17:24.438 --> 17:26.133
You sold me out
with those thank-you notes.

17:26.239 --> 17:29.299
And what's with this
Roman Holiday obsession?

17:29.409 --> 17:32.640
I know you, Dupree.
Your favorite movie's Fletch.

17:32.746 --> 17:36.512
No, sir. No, it's not. Fletch is in
my top five. It's not my favorite.

17:36.616 --> 17:39.744
What's with the poetry? I think
you're trying to show me up.

17:39.820 --> 17:42.448
Maybe I like poetry.
Did that ever occur to you?

17:42.522 --> 17:45.184
Listen, if I got to be
the lovable fuckup all my life

17:45.292 --> 17:47.021
to win your best friend prize,

17:47.094 --> 17:49.187
maybe you should
keep your award.

17:49.296 --> 17:53.357
I've got news for you, Dupree.
You're not that lovable.

17:57.838 --> 18:00.204
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that, Carl.

18:00.307 --> 18:02.207
Goodbye, Mr. Grumpy.

18:23.563 --> 18:24.689
Sugar.

18:24.798 --> 18:27.028
Top shelf, behind the honey.

18:27.901 --> 18:30.461
Where?
Top shelf, behind the honey.

18:30.537 --> 18:31.697
Oh, yeah.

18:31.805 --> 18:33.636
You got to reach for it.
Okay.

18:33.707 --> 18:36.073
Yeah, right there.
Oh, God.

18:36.176 --> 18:38.736
You gotta reach. Right
there. I'm reaching.

18:38.845 --> 18:40.335
Oh, goodness.

18:42.816 --> 18:43.976
Right there.

18:44.051 --> 18:47.578
There's the sugar.
Right behind the honey.

18:49.322 --> 18:51.483
Right there. You got it?
I got it.

18:51.558 --> 18:55.255
Why do you do this to me?
Got it.

19:01.568 --> 19:02.865
So good.

19:09.676 --> 19:11.109
Bye, honey.

19:15.182 --> 19:18.777
WOMAN.. Hello? Hello. Yes.
Is Mandy there, please?

19:19.586 --> 19:21.611
Is this Dupree
calling again?

19:21.721 --> 19:23.279
Yes, this is Dupree again.

19:23.390 --> 19:26.120
Get it through your head. Mandy
does not want to talk to you, okay?

19:26.226 --> 19:28.524
Okay, yeah,
just tell her that I called.

19:28.595 --> 19:30.586
Good night.
Thank you.

19:38.939 --> 19:42.033
Looks like we're going
camping again, Murphy.

19:57.657 --> 20:00.683
Oh, God!
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

20:00.760 --> 20:03.957
I didn't know you were down
here. No, it's my fault.

20:04.064 --> 20:06.396
What in the hell is going on?
Nothing, honey. It's fine.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.263
Nothing. Nothing.
Are you naked again?

20:08.335 --> 20:10.269
No, no, no, it's fine.
We talked about this!

20:10.337 --> 20:12.134
I know we did. Yes.

20:12.239 --> 20:14.935
Everyone's asleep,
and here's lonely old Dupree

20:15.008 --> 20:19.104
just waling away on himself. You
weren't waling away on yourself. It...

20:19.179 --> 20:22.342
God! An animal wouldn't
debase himself thus.

20:22.449 --> 20:24.974
What is happening to me? Is
this one of my tube socks?

20:25.085 --> 20:26.746
Carl, please.
Answer the question!

20:26.820 --> 20:28.412
Oh, my God.
Mine were dirty.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.353
Carl, stop it! Relax.

20:32.492 --> 20:36.428
Wait a minute. What are you
even doing down here, Molly?

20:38.131 --> 20:40.964
Are you serious?
It's a simple question.

20:41.034 --> 20:42.797
I couldn't sleep.

20:43.770 --> 20:45.601
I'm getting a broom.

20:46.339 --> 20:48.000
This is rock bottom.

20:48.275 --> 20:50.243
I was doing so good.

20:50.310 --> 20:53.108
Wasn't I doing good, Carl?
Huh, buddy?

20:53.613 --> 20:55.808
But, Dupree,
where did you find this?

20:55.882 --> 20:58.146
Oh.
I got it from that box marked

20:58.218 --> 21:01.813
"Carl's camping equipment"
in the garage.

21:03.256 --> 21:05.918
You put the box away,
didn't you? Yes. Yes.

21:05.992 --> 21:08.790
I'm 990% sure I put it away.

21:17.170 --> 21:20.367
I didn't realize you were
such an outdoorsman, Carl.

21:20.473 --> 21:22.100
Asian Assault?
Molly, let me explain.

21:22.175 --> 21:24.370
That one was in the wrong
section at the video store.

21:24.477 --> 21:25.603
Oh,
you're gonna lie to my face.

21:25.679 --> 21:27.271
I thought it was a kung
fu movie with Bruce Lee.

21:27.347 --> 21:29.315
Okay. Pacific Rim Job.
No idea.

21:29.382 --> 21:31.213
All right. That one
I kind of knew about.

21:31.318 --> 21:33.809
Oh, Beijing Bang Bang?

21:33.887 --> 21:36.048
Carl! Is this what
our marriage has come to?

21:36.156 --> 21:41.150
Lies and all these
Chinese fetish videos?

21:41.228 --> 21:42.490
I'm just curious.

21:42.562 --> 21:46.396
All right. I admit, Molly, that I was
into Asian porn for a little while.

21:46.499 --> 21:48.467
But it was just a phase.

21:48.535 --> 21:51.629
Anyway, why am I the one
who's on trial here?

21:51.705 --> 21:54.299
He's in there starching my sock,
and you don't even bat an eyelash.

21:54.374 --> 21:56.808
Because I'm not
married to him!

21:57.177 --> 21:59.202
I am married to you.

22:01.414 --> 22:03.143
Do something with that.

22:13.026 --> 22:14.584
Is there anything worse

22:14.694 --> 22:17.356
than having to throw away
your porn collection?

22:17.430 --> 22:19.091
What's going on
with you and Molly?

22:19.199 --> 22:20.928
What?
You heard me.

22:21.034 --> 22:22.865
Are you in love with my wife?

22:22.936 --> 22:25.370
Have you lost your mind?
What are you talking about?

22:25.438 --> 22:27.065
Dupree. Dupree,
just answer the question.

22:27.173 --> 22:29.266
Whoa, hold on, Jake LaMotta.
I'm not gonna...

22:29.376 --> 22:31.742
That's a sick question.
How come you can't answer it?

22:31.845 --> 22:34.575
I'm not going to answer because
it doesn't deserve an answer.

22:34.681 --> 22:37.582
How could you ask me
something like that?

22:38.551 --> 22:40.712
You're very clever, Dupree.

22:41.121 --> 22:42.952
You're living in my house.

22:43.056 --> 22:46.082
You're going to town
on yourself in my living room.

22:46.192 --> 22:49.628
And now you're moving
in on my wife. What?

22:49.729 --> 22:51.424
You think you got it
all figured out,

22:51.498 --> 22:53.363
but I'm on to you,
and you're out of here!

22:53.433 --> 22:55.901
Oh, no. Hold on. You're
not throwing me out of here.

22:55.969 --> 22:58.199
I'll leave! Good! And
while you're at it,

22:58.271 --> 23:00.432
leave the flask
and the groomsman's outfit.

23:00.540 --> 23:02.531
But you gave those to me.
Those were gifts.

23:02.609 --> 23:04.543
All right! You know, keep
those. All those were gifts.

23:04.611 --> 23:05.635
But leave the insignia.

23:06.079 --> 23:08.570
Because that was
for my best man.

23:49.756 --> 23:51.747
Hey. It's for the best.

23:53.326 --> 23:56.489
The guy would have been
living off us forever.

24:01.368 --> 24:05.532
Dinner is at 7:30, and my father
will be here at 7:00, so...

24:06.306 --> 24:09.332
Molly.
With all things considered,

24:09.442 --> 24:11.603
do you think that maybe
tonight isn't the best night

24:11.678 --> 24:13.236
to have your father
over for dinner?

24:13.313 --> 24:16.111
Carl. Carl.
Please don't be late.

24:16.182 --> 24:17.444
Please.

24:28.895 --> 24:32.831
So, I hear the albacore are
really biting this time of year.

24:35.201 --> 24:37.567
It's not albacore season,
Carl.

24:38.405 --> 24:41.465
Oh. Really?

24:48.815 --> 24:50.373
I'll get that.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.650
It's right over here.

24:57.023 --> 24:58.081
Hello.

24:58.191 --> 25:01.718
Hold on. Hey. Hey,
Carl. Carl. It's Neil.

25:01.828 --> 25:04.661
Did you actually throw away
your porn collection?

25:04.731 --> 25:06.858
Look, Neil,
I'm having a dinner party.

25:06.933 --> 25:08.764
I'm coming to get it.

25:08.868 --> 25:10.768
Going to Starbucks! Be back!

25:21.714 --> 25:25.377
Carl, I read
your new presentation.

25:27.887 --> 25:31.448
And how would you feel about
Tony taking it from here?

25:32.559 --> 25:33.719
What?

25:34.260 --> 25:36.285
I hope you guys aren't
talking business now.

25:36.396 --> 25:37.693
Let's keep it at the office.

25:37.764 --> 25:40.198
No, no, no, not at all.
No, we were...

25:40.266 --> 25:42.894
Oh, my God.
Is that Mom's crab cakes?

25:43.136 --> 25:45.536
They sure are.
Rabbit, come here.

25:45.605 --> 25:47.937
Excuse me.
Come here, rabbit.

25:48.908 --> 25:52.207
They look exactly like Mom's.
I can't believe it.

25:55.482 --> 25:57.973
Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
Give it to Tony. Tony. Yeah.

25:58.084 --> 25:59.449
Yeah. Want to give it to Tony?

25:59.552 --> 26:02.077
Yeah, I have a pretty goddamn
big problem with that.

26:02.155 --> 26:04.089
Is that what you're saying?
You'd be demoting me?

26:04.157 --> 26:06.751
Tony deserves it!
Give it to Tony!

26:07.093 --> 26:09.391
Do you think I care? Go ahead.

26:09.462 --> 26:11.555
What are you doing?
Son of a...

26:13.233 --> 26:14.962
Huh? Your father's got it out for me.

26:15.068 --> 26:16.296
Oh, Carl!
No, no, no!

26:16.402 --> 26:18.233
You know he asked me
to get a vasectomy?

26:18.304 --> 26:19.430
What?
He's crazy!

26:19.506 --> 26:21.531
Carl, first of all, this is
my father you're talking about!

26:21.608 --> 26:22.870
He's irrational.

26:27.146 --> 26:28.704
Who...
You want...

26:30.316 --> 26:32.477
What was that?
Oh, my God.

26:36.389 --> 26:39.153
You. What the hell?
Oh, my God. Dupree!

26:39.259 --> 26:41.056
What did I tell you?
Molly, don't.

26:41.127 --> 26:42.754
I'm okay. I just slipped
on the drainpipe.

26:42.829 --> 26:43.955
Come on.
Let's get in the house.

26:44.030 --> 26:45.190
I didn't want to
bother you guys.

26:45.265 --> 26:47.165
Put him out by the curb!
Carl.

26:47.267 --> 26:50.395
Why am I getting blamed for
everything? What's going on here, Carl?

26:50.470 --> 26:53.166
Daddy, will you please
grab Dupree's things?

26:53.273 --> 26:56.242
I was just trying to get my stuff. What?

27:01.915 --> 27:06.443
You know, Molly, I don't know that I
really have time for dinner. I might just...

27:06.519 --> 27:08.487
You know, I really don't
want to impose. Here.

27:08.588 --> 27:10.419
Maybe I... I know, but I...
No. You're staying.

27:10.490 --> 27:12.117
You're gonna eat something.
It's fine. You're eating.

27:12.191 --> 27:14.421
Here, have some salad.
It's good.

27:14.494 --> 27:16.792
I put a little extra
balsamic like you like it.

27:16.863 --> 27:19.161
Thanks. Thanks.

27:20.033 --> 27:21.591
Eat something.

27:21.935 --> 27:25.029
Well, it does look tasty.
Thank you.

27:28.708 --> 27:29.834
Sir?

27:32.211 --> 27:35.840
That's a beautiful Schwinn
bike you got out there, Dupree.

27:35.949 --> 27:39.510
Thank you. Although it's not
exactly state-of-the-art.

27:39.886 --> 27:41.649
It's about 25 years old,

27:41.721 --> 27:45.179
so sometimes I feel like it's tough to
keep up with the other riders on the road.

27:45.291 --> 27:47.156
Now, I don't buy that.

27:47.226 --> 27:50.718
Did you read Lance Armstrong's
book, It's Not About the Bike?

27:50.830 --> 27:53.355
The bike. Touché.
And it's true.

27:53.466 --> 27:55.696
It isn't about the bike.
It's about here.

27:55.802 --> 27:57.736
It's about your heart.
And that's the truth.

27:57.837 --> 27:59.702
And I've said it to Carl.
If you...

28:00.974 --> 28:02.566
Did you see his seventh win?

28:02.675 --> 28:04.074
The final one?
The last one?

28:04.177 --> 28:06.008
I watched every stage.
Carl. Get the phone.

28:06.079 --> 28:08.673
Me, too. I've watched every
single one of those races.

28:08.748 --> 28:10.807
Did you ever cry?
Oh, yeah.

28:10.883 --> 28:13.477
I defy you to watch
that and not cry.

28:13.553 --> 28:15.316
Daddy? Excuse me. Could
you pass the wine, please?

28:15.388 --> 28:16.480
What color was your bike?

28:16.556 --> 28:18.319
Hello.
Hey, Carl.

28:18.658 --> 28:20.023
Hey, hey. It's Neil.

28:20.093 --> 28:22.425
Okay, so is it in, like, the
garbage, or did you recycle it?

28:22.528 --> 28:25.088
Listen, you sleazebag.
Get off my property!

28:25.198 --> 28:28.759
I'm tired of this crap! Get
the hell out of here! Go home!

28:28.935 --> 28:30.266
Jackpot.

28:42.348 --> 28:44.248
It's the wrong number.

28:50.423 --> 28:52.220
You like to fish, Dupree?

28:52.291 --> 28:54.555
I'm not the world's
greatest fisherman.

28:54.627 --> 28:57.790
Although I did have
one pretty great adventure.

28:57.897 --> 29:00.889
True story. Off the coast
of Baja during spring break,

29:00.967 --> 29:03.868
I spent four days
reeling in this marlin.

29:03.936 --> 29:06.700
Great, big, old shitkicker,
and I finally landed him.

29:06.773 --> 29:07.899
Four days?

29:07.974 --> 29:09.874
Well, I hope you mounted
that son of a bitch.

29:09.942 --> 29:14.311
No. I didn't. Catch and
release, Bob. Honor the fish.

29:16.282 --> 29:18.113
That's really noble.

29:18.951 --> 29:23.752
Dupree. How would you like to
go fishing with me in my boat?

29:23.823 --> 29:25.085
Really?

29:25.458 --> 29:27.585
Yeah. Just the two of us.

29:27.660 --> 29:30.128
Chick-a-boom. Chick-a-boom.

29:33.166 --> 29:34.497
Why not?

29:35.134 --> 29:38.228
Hey, Bob, is it just me, or
are the albacore really jumping?

29:39.605 --> 29:40.833
You're funny.

29:40.940 --> 29:43.932
What type of fool thinks
it's albacore season?

29:44.110 --> 29:46.943
Dupree, from now on,
you call me "Dad."

29:47.647 --> 29:51.014
Yeah. Go out there.
Maybe bring Molly along.

30:20.179 --> 30:22.977
Nice, Dupree.
Need some of this?

30:26.986 --> 30:29.045
You sure you're
okay with this, Bob?

30:29.155 --> 30:31.555
As long as it's not Carl, you
can do anything you want with her.

30:45.304 --> 30:49.502
Poetry, Aunt Kathy, librarian-banging,
backstabbing, bike-riding,

30:49.575 --> 30:51.338
couch-burning masturbator!

30:51.410 --> 30:54.174
You ruined my life! You ruined my
life! Carl, get off of him! Stop it!

30:54.247 --> 30:56.238
Get a hold of yourself!

30:57.316 --> 30:59.375
Oh, my God! I will not
get a hold of myself!

30:59.485 --> 31:01.680
This is my house!
Are you kidding me?

31:01.754 --> 31:05.190
What are you gonna do,
hit me with that thing?

31:05.258 --> 31:07.055
You gonna hit me?
Carl, stop it!

31:07.160 --> 31:08.354
Come on! I dare you!

31:08.427 --> 31:10.019
Dad!

31:10.763 --> 31:12.253
You dared me.

31:16.536 --> 31:19.403
Don't tell me you want the porn
back, because you can't have it!

31:19.472 --> 31:21.167
Why is it all Asian?

31:21.240 --> 31:23.140
Whoa, what's with
the bag of frozen peas, man?

31:23.209 --> 31:24.836
There was a little bit of
a blowout at the house.

31:24.911 --> 31:27.573
My wallet's still there
and my car's boxed in.

31:27.680 --> 31:30.080
It's not a big deal.
I need a place to stay.

31:30.183 --> 31:32.378
I've got nowhere to go.
You want to stay here?

31:32.451 --> 31:34.510
Yeah.
Yeah. That'll be fun.

31:34.587 --> 31:37.522
That'll be really cool.
Let me ask Annie.

31:38.691 --> 31:40.158
Yo, Annie.
What?

31:40.226 --> 31:41.853
Carl wants to stay here.
Carl?

31:41.928 --> 31:44.761
Oh, really? I just got off the phone
with Molly. He tried to kill Dupree.

31:44.864 --> 31:46.695
He cannot stay here.
He needs somewhere...

31:46.766 --> 31:48.757
What are we gonna do?
Be afraid in my sleep? No!

31:48.868 --> 31:52.668
Tell him to leave! Now! Now!
Okay. Fine. I said fine!

31:52.738 --> 31:57.107
Look, I don't know what you did,
but she just talked to Molly.

31:57.210 --> 31:58.871
She's freaked out
at you right now, man.

31:58.945 --> 32:01.436
Neil, what are you saying? I can't
come into your house right now?

32:01.547 --> 32:03.606
You cannot come in here.

32:03.716 --> 32:05.581
She said so, man.
She makes the rules.

32:05.685 --> 32:08.449
You know what?
I don't need this, Neil.

32:09.121 --> 32:11.919
I don't need this.
I don't need this!

32:12.525 --> 32:14.516
I'm sorry! Neil, get back in here!

32:14.594 --> 32:16.585
She controls what I do!

32:16.696 --> 32:19.688
Guys' night. Thursday.
I'll see you there.

32:20.933 --> 32:24.869
WOMAN ON PA.. Dr. Grayhead to
the ER. Dr. Grayhead to the ER.

32:25.571 --> 32:28.597
Frankly, Molly, I'm
worried about your safety.

32:28.708 --> 32:30.767
Maybe I should have Paco
come stay at the house.

32:30.877 --> 32:32.970
Oh, Dad, please.
I don't need this right now.

32:33.079 --> 32:36.537
Molly, I love you more than
anything, but you're an idealist.

32:36.616 --> 32:38.481
You don't see the world
the way it is.

32:38.584 --> 32:43.783
Dr. Navarro to 751.
Dr. Navarro to 751.

32:48.294 --> 32:51.457
The doc says most of
my injuries are emotional.

32:52.265 --> 32:54.790
Dad. I'm going to
ask you something,

32:54.901 --> 32:57.961
and remember, you've never
lied to me before.

32:59.605 --> 33:02.631
Do you ever really want
my marriage to work?

33:08.347 --> 33:11.441
That's a really
complicated question, Molly.

33:12.618 --> 33:15.280
No. Actually, it's not.

33:16.155 --> 33:17.452
Dupree.

33:17.523 --> 33:19.514
Molly? Molly.

33:24.797 --> 33:28.096
Bob, before I go, I have
my own question for you.

33:28.968 --> 33:32.961
And remember, you've never lied
to me either, as far as I know.

33:34.707 --> 33:37.540
Who did you really want
to get a vasectomy?

33:37.643 --> 33:41.204
Me? Or was it, in fact, Carl?

33:43.182 --> 33:45.650
Take care of your neck,
Dupree.

33:48.054 --> 33:49.453
Okay, Bob.

35:12.972 --> 35:14.132
Carl?

35:24.316 --> 35:26.716
He didn't come home
last night.

35:35.928 --> 35:37.759
He loves you, Molly.

35:41.567 --> 35:43.125
I know. I know.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.602
Maybe it's just not enough.

36:22.675 --> 36:27.169
It has to be enough.
It is enough.

36:28.013 --> 36:32.677
Dupree, you gotta piece this
beautiful thing back together again.

36:32.785 --> 36:37.779
By God, it took 36 years, 9 months, and
23 days for the mother ship to speak.

36:38.657 --> 36:40.386
Well, guess what?

36:42.561 --> 36:44.324
Dupree hears you.

36:47.166 --> 36:50.101
Okay, gather around! Come on!
Everybody, gather around! Over here!

36:50.169 --> 36:51.261
What's going on, Dupree?

36:51.337 --> 36:53.237
I'm gonna tell you what's
going on. We got an emergency.

36:53.339 --> 36:55.136
That's why I gave you
permission to miss school.

36:55.207 --> 36:57.072
Now, listen. Carl's missing.

36:57.143 --> 36:58.872
He ran away
from home last night.

36:58.944 --> 37:01.344
It's up to us to find him.
And here's the deal.

37:01.447 --> 37:03.312
I don't know
what he's capable of.

37:03.382 --> 37:06.442
If he attacks you, go limp.
Play dead.

37:06.519 --> 37:08.453
That's what I did,
and I think it saved my life.

37:08.521 --> 37:10.989
Toshi, pass out these fliers.
Give them to everybody.

37:11.056 --> 37:13.889
Okay, Nancy, go to Neil's
house. Okay, I'm on it.

37:13.993 --> 37:15.460
Go. Go! Cesar, get up here.

37:15.528 --> 37:17.359
I want you to hit the
grocery store. Got it.

37:17.463 --> 37:20.057
Thompson Land Development.
Danger! Be careful here.

37:20.166 --> 37:21.531
Go! Go! Fall out!

37:21.634 --> 37:25.832
And if you see him, call
someone. Do the buddy system. Run!

37:28.240 --> 37:31.641
I'm just looking for this guy, Carl
Peterson, if you see him. Right here.

37:31.710 --> 37:34.508
I've just lost my friend.
Carl Peterson.

37:34.580 --> 37:37.378
Here you go. Just stand there.
Put your head through this.

37:41.587 --> 37:43.179
Carl!

37:47.493 --> 37:50.621
Here you go. There you go.
Looking for a friend. That's all.

37:58.270 --> 38:02.036
And he took his hat. That was
real. His American Legion hat.

38:02.107 --> 38:04.041
The colonel. Give us a break.

38:08.714 --> 38:10.204
Back again, huh?

38:10.282 --> 38:11.943
Just came in
to make a pit stop.

38:12.051 --> 38:15.350
Well, that's good
'cause your cot's been taken.

38:16.689 --> 38:18.748
What's he talking about?

38:27.700 --> 38:30.635
How's Becca doing?
Is she coming in later?

38:33.639 --> 38:35.869
In case you think
I'm still in love with Molly,

38:35.941 --> 38:38.102
maybe you should
take a look at these.

38:38.777 --> 38:42.577
They're all about Mandy.
Love poems.

38:44.149 --> 38:47.641
Sonnets.
Little ditties, haikus.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.610
I loved her.

38:49.722 --> 38:52.657
How come you never told me
you wrote poems?

38:52.891 --> 38:56.383
I don't know. I guess I
figured you'd call me a homo.

38:57.229 --> 38:59.424
Well, I guess I might have.

38:59.598 --> 39:04.729
Listen, if there's one thing I
know about, it's loving and losing.

39:04.803 --> 39:07.237
But you can't lose unless
you stop waiting. And...

39:07.306 --> 39:09.240
Look, Dupree. Listen,
I'm really not in the mood

39:09.308 --> 39:10.468
for one of your soliloquies.

39:10.576 --> 39:12.908
My life's in the shitter
right now. Yes, it is.

39:12.978 --> 39:14.946
But what are you
gonna do? Quit?

39:15.014 --> 39:18.450
So what if you made some
mistakes. Everybody does.

39:18.517 --> 39:19.950
So what if her dad hates you.

39:20.019 --> 39:22.613
You think you're the first guy
to be hated by his father-in-law?

39:22.688 --> 39:25.179
So what if he beat your ass
with a candlestick.

39:25.291 --> 39:27.282
That's probably
happened before.

39:27.359 --> 39:31.193
The point is, is somewhere along
the road, you lost your magic.

39:31.297 --> 39:34.596
They knocked you off your game. Your
Carlness went right out the window.

39:34.667 --> 39:38.330
What's with this "Carlness"?
It's not even a real word.

39:38.437 --> 39:39.870
Yes, it is.
Oh, it is?

39:39.972 --> 39:42.202
It's a verb.
It's a conjunction,

39:42.274 --> 39:44.868
a preposition, it's a
philosophy, a way of life.

39:45.010 --> 39:47.706
It's your name
with "ness" attached to it.

39:47.813 --> 39:50.976
Bullshit. There's never
been any Carlness.

39:52.818 --> 39:54.615
There's just Carl.

40:00.526 --> 40:04.462
Well, I'm glad we got that
straightened out. My mistake.

40:12.705 --> 40:14.332
You know, the truth is,

40:14.406 --> 40:17.569
I never really thought you and
Molly were right for each other.

40:17.676 --> 40:20.668
There was something about her I
never bought, right from Jump Street.

40:20.746 --> 40:23.214
That whole, "Hey, look at me.
I'm a great person.

40:23.315 --> 40:27.479
"I'm always smiling. I'm pretty. I'm
smart. I work with inner city kids."

40:27.553 --> 40:31.182
Get the hell out of there. I saw
through that sham, and you did, too.

40:31.256 --> 40:33.554
And if you want to know the
truth, frankly, I'd blame her.

40:33.659 --> 40:35.251
Now, wait a minute!
No, I won't hold it!

40:35.361 --> 40:37.522
Hold on a second! Your life is
going to hell in a hand basket!

40:37.596 --> 40:40.258
Molly is the best damn thing
that ever happened to me.

40:40.699 --> 40:43.099
Leave her out of this.
Sure she is.

40:43.202 --> 40:45.932
Did you see what just
happened? When I tricked you?

40:46.038 --> 40:48.563
All of a sudden you had that
instinct to fight, that Carlness.

40:48.674 --> 40:51.939
That's what this situation
needs. It's crying out for it.

40:52.378 --> 40:56.280
You're trying to get it back,
that fight, the will to fight.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.376
You're thinking.

41:00.352 --> 41:02.411
Come on. What do you got?

41:03.122 --> 41:05.920
Dupree, get your helmet.

41:10.729 --> 41:11.957
Shit.

41:13.465 --> 41:15.057
Paco's on duty.

41:16.268 --> 41:19.897
Hey, can you get me 10 minutes
in there? I'll get you 15.

41:19.972 --> 41:22.873
Hold on a second. He's a
lot faster than he looks.

41:29.415 --> 41:32.543
Hello there. Have a
message I need to deliver.

41:32.618 --> 41:34.950
Do you have identification?
No.

41:35.254 --> 41:38.121
You kidding me?
Just got the old bike here.

41:38.223 --> 41:40.817
Pretty obvious
I'm a bike messenger.

41:43.962 --> 41:45.759
What are you, Samoan?

41:45.831 --> 41:46.991
What do you think?

41:47.099 --> 41:50.500
Could be Greek. Could be ltalian.
Either way, you're a big man.

41:50.602 --> 41:52.297
It's okay,
I specialize in big men.

41:52.404 --> 41:53.769
Where is your message?

41:53.839 --> 41:55.807
I keep 'em up here.
Saves on the paperwork.

41:55.908 --> 41:58.468
All right. Have a good day.
Maybe I'll see you around.

42:01.980 --> 42:03.641
Come on.

42:04.650 --> 42:06.015
Hold it.

42:13.158 --> 42:15.285
They said you were quick.

42:16.595 --> 42:20.395
Easy now, big 'un. I got to tell
you, you're catching me on a day

42:20.466 --> 42:24.061
where I'm throwing seven
different kinds of smoke.

42:24.470 --> 42:27.166
Yeah? Let's see them.

42:33.512 --> 42:35.480
That's what I thought.

42:35.747 --> 42:37.476
That's number one.

42:38.350 --> 42:41.683
Baby wants to play chase?
Okay, let's chase.

42:42.488 --> 42:44.786
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

42:49.495 --> 42:51.258
Up or down? Up or down?

42:51.330 --> 42:52.820
Down!

42:58.170 --> 43:00.764
Gotcha.
Missed! Number two.

43:05.644 --> 43:07.544
Mr. Peterson-Thompson?

43:07.646 --> 43:09.113
Where is he?

43:11.216 --> 43:13.047
Stop! Stop!

43:13.151 --> 43:15.278
Catch up!

43:28.634 --> 43:30.795
Guy in chair. Number three.

43:33.639 --> 43:35.869
Did you see that? I got him.

43:40.679 --> 43:43.204
Dispatch,
lock down the building.

43:44.550 --> 43:46.848
That was my number four.

43:46.919 --> 43:50.878
What's number five? I can't
tell you. I don't know myself.

43:54.560 --> 43:57.654
Nice job, weasel.
Now it's on!

44:09.841 --> 44:13.072
Number five, invisible.

44:13.178 --> 44:14.873
What is he doing?

44:18.684 --> 44:22.347
You can manufacture
these for $90 a square foot.

44:22.421 --> 44:24.787
You sell them
at $400 a square foot.

44:24.890 --> 44:28.053
You got 25 in this
whole arena right here.

44:28.126 --> 44:30.754
I even think you can
do the advertisement,

44:30.862 --> 44:33.092
"Fifty million

44:35.767 --> 44:37.234
"square feet."

44:39.705 --> 44:41.536
Come here, weasel!

44:44.142 --> 44:45.575
Number six.

44:46.979 --> 44:49.709
Open the door.
I need a number seven.

44:50.716 --> 44:52.081
Oh, shit.

44:59.658 --> 45:01.592
I need a number seven!

45:02.761 --> 45:05.924
You want Samoa?
I'll give you Samoa!

45:23.649 --> 45:27.176
Hello. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Pardon me.

45:27.753 --> 45:31.154
You know,
for the last 14 hours,

45:31.757 --> 45:33.952
all I've thought about
is kicking your ass.

45:34.026 --> 45:36.654
Don't make me look
for another candlestick, Carl.

45:36.762 --> 45:40.289
I've taken you down once.
I could do it again.

45:41.099 --> 45:43.260
Not today, Bob. Not today.

45:43.969 --> 45:47.769
I'll go get Paco.
Yeah. You go get Paco.

45:48.874 --> 45:51.308
You've done everything
you can to undermine me.

45:51.376 --> 45:55.312
You've tried to intimidate me.
You've tried to humiliate me.

45:56.014 --> 46:00.280
You bastardized my project to the
point where it's unrecognizable.

46:00.352 --> 46:03.446
But here's the thing, Bob.
I don't care.

46:03.955 --> 46:06.788
I don't care about this job,
and I don't care about you.

46:06.858 --> 46:08.655
I care about Molly.

46:10.462 --> 46:13.329
She means everything
in the world to me.

46:14.900 --> 46:18.859
And if you're going to stand in the
way of me trying to win her back,

46:18.970 --> 46:22.030
you'd better bring
a pretty big candlestick.

46:27.813 --> 46:29.007
Carl?

46:30.549 --> 46:31.982
Hey, Carl.

46:35.921 --> 46:39.084
You... Will you all excuse us?

46:42.828 --> 46:45.388
Can everybody go?

47:00.245 --> 47:03.942
You know, Carl,
I've been thinking

47:05.283 --> 47:08.013
maybe I was a little
rough on you. A little?

47:08.086 --> 47:11.954
But you got to understand,
you know, I love Molly, too.

47:13.759 --> 47:17.855
And I've been having a really,
really tough time letting go of her.

47:19.397 --> 47:21.797
You asked me to
get a vasectomy.

47:22.934 --> 47:25.528
Yeah, that was
a little excessive.

47:28.306 --> 47:29.773
I apologize.

47:34.379 --> 47:37.109
I'm not gonna
hyphenate my name, Bob.

47:38.517 --> 47:39.779
I know.

48:38.143 --> 48:40.509
Hey. There's Carl and Dupree.

48:45.417 --> 48:47.180
Dupree found Carl.

49:17.682 --> 49:19.172
He's on his own now.

49:19.885 --> 49:21.113
Molly?

49:29.527 --> 49:30.789
Molly?

50:00.492 --> 50:01.754
Molly.

50:03.061 --> 50:04.426
I'm sorry.

50:18.076 --> 50:20.510
Don't ever walk out
on me again.

50:22.514 --> 50:23.708
Ever.

50:24.049 --> 50:26.950
I know. I lost it.

50:30.055 --> 50:31.682
I didn't know
what I was doing anymore.

50:31.756 --> 50:34.384
Well, Carl, I don't always
know what I'm doing, either.

50:34.459 --> 50:38.088
But we are in this together,
when it's good, when it's bad.

50:38.196 --> 50:39.424
Yeah.

50:39.531 --> 50:42.523
I mean, so you launched yourself
across our dining room table

50:42.600 --> 50:45.535
at your best friend
like a crazy person.

50:47.739 --> 50:49.104
I guess I...
But, Carl,

50:49.207 --> 50:53.405
I know who you are.
And I love who you are.

50:55.814 --> 50:59.045
And that's why we don't
walk out on each other.

51:03.488 --> 51:05.251
I love you, Molly.

51:07.659 --> 51:11.823
And I promise you,
I'm not going anywhere.

51:25.510 --> 51:28.138
Yes! My work is done here.

51:40.258 --> 51:43.694
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

51:46.164 --> 51:48.155
Come on! Let's go! Go!

51:48.266 --> 51:51.861
Who wants some ice cream? Go
down there and you get it. Go!

51:59.778 --> 52:00.938
Yeah!

52:07.452 --> 52:09.647
DUPREE ON MICROPHONE.. Life may
knock you down. Scratch that.

52:09.721 --> 52:10.949
I'm okay.

52:11.022 --> 52:13.650
Life will knock you down.
Okay?

52:13.725 --> 52:17.161
It'll kick you in the gut
and knock you to the curb.

52:17.228 --> 52:19.856
But you can't let it
rob you of your "ness."

52:19.964 --> 52:23.491
Now what's "ness"?
It's your name plus "ness."

52:24.069 --> 52:26.663
You, sir, white-haired
gentleman, what's your name?

52:26.738 --> 52:29.639
My name's Joe.
No! It's Joeness.

52:29.707 --> 52:31.834
You follow me? Listen to me.

52:31.910 --> 52:35.243
Hang on to that, and as long as
you do, you'll always be ready.

52:35.346 --> 52:39.407
Because when that moment comes,
and trust me, it will come,

52:40.185 --> 52:42.210
that's when you start throwing

52:42.320 --> 52:46.222
seven different
kinds of smoke!

52:57.802 --> 53:02.171
The mother ship hears you!

53:02.841 --> 53:05.139
Paco! Kick it!

58:22.026 --> 58:23.425
Lanceness.

58:24.695 --> 58:26.253
Lance-ness.

58:27.432 --> 58:29.457
Lance...ness.

58:29.458 --> 58:35.458
