00:06.871 --> 00:07.964
Brad!

00:09.474 --> 00:13.206
How many times have I told him
not to leave these lying around?

00:15.113 --> 00:16.741
This'll show him.

00:20.985 --> 00:22.544
What am I doing?

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:35.133 --> 00:37.261
Honestly, what do you think?

00:41.005 --> 00:45.170
- It's kind of a "lumber jacket."
- Yeah! Yeah! That's good.

00:45.276 --> 00:47.575
I'm wearing this to kick off
Woodworking Week.

00:47.645 --> 00:50.581
Honey, listen,
the Calvin Pine collection.

00:52.517 --> 00:56.613
- You smell kind of like a bookshelf.
- Yeah. It's Old Cedar.

00:58.756 --> 00:59.780
It's very sexy.

00:59.857 --> 01:01.223
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.056
I thought you had to
go to the class today.

01:04.128 --> 01:06.029
- Not till about 10:00.
- Oh, boy!

01:06.097 --> 01:10.000
I have a kind of a window of
opportunity. How about you?

01:10.068 --> 01:13.197
Oh, I've got to be at <i>Tool Time</i>
in 20 minutes.

01:13.271 --> 01:16.036
So, I just have, like, a little peephole.

01:16.874 --> 01:19.605
- Oh, boy.
- I can work with that, I think.

01:20.478 --> 01:22.743
No. I gotta... I gotta...

01:24.215 --> 01:26.184
- Should we get that?
- What?

01:27.719 --> 01:29.051
The phone.

01:29.454 --> 01:31.548
No. Let the machine get it.

01:33.524 --> 01:35.220
<i>Hey, bro. It's Jeff.</i>

01:35.293 --> 01:37.293
<i>Listen, I decided to take you up
on your invitation</i>

01:37.362 --> 01:39.831
<i>to have dinner and watch the fight.</i>

01:39.897 --> 01:41.263
<i>Although I may be a little late</i>

01:41.332 --> 01:44.496
<i>because I have an appointment
with my podiatrist.</i>

01:45.503 --> 01:49.031
<i>Tim, I've got a fungus infection
between my toes</i>

01:49.107 --> 01:51.576
<i>that would just turn your stomach.</i>

01:51.642 --> 01:53.581
Just ignore him.
He does that to get a rise out of me.

01:53.611 --> 01:55.443
- He won't.
<i>- It's unbelievable, Timmy!</i>

01:55.513 --> 01:58.813
<i>There's this yellow stuff oozing out
of my toenails.</i>

02:00.418 --> 02:03.479
<i>Actually, it's more of a light green
or a tea</i>

02:04.989 --> 02:06.890
<i>Hard to describe on the phone, Tim.</i>

02:06.958 --> 02:09.894
<i>I'll show you tonight over dinner,
okay? See ya.</i>

02:11.062 --> 02:13.531
That just put a lock on my window.

02:14.399 --> 02:17.301
Hey, but Daddy's got the master key!

03:10.321 --> 03:11.880
Okay, I know this.

03:11.989 --> 03:16.757
The cerebrum is responsible for
sensory and neural function,

03:16.861 --> 03:19.126
motor coordination...

03:19.197 --> 03:20.961
And one more thing.

03:24.569 --> 03:26.094
Memory! Damn!

03:31.175 --> 03:32.837
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

03:33.711 --> 03:35.202
What are you doing home so early?

03:35.279 --> 03:37.976
Three words. Rag, oil, match.

03:43.488 --> 03:45.855
Well, the boys are still at school.

03:45.957 --> 03:48.620
How's that window situation
holding up?

03:49.527 --> 03:51.689
Oh, the window.

03:52.363 --> 03:56.130
Actually, I'm wide open until after 2:00.

03:56.234 --> 03:59.204
And then again between 3:00 and 3:30.

04:01.639 --> 04:04.108
Two windows in the same afternoon?

04:06.143 --> 04:08.703
There's bound to be
some broken glass.

04:09.947 --> 04:11.848
I'm willing to risk it.

04:16.687 --> 04:19.623
- Should we get that?
- Let the machine get it.

04:22.293 --> 04:24.524
Jill, honey, it's me, Carrie!

04:25.329 --> 04:29.232
- Oh, my God! That's my sister Carrie!
- Let the machine get it.

04:30.701 --> 04:32.260
Surprise!

04:32.370 --> 04:33.736
Hi, Carrie.

04:35.406 --> 04:36.897
What ya doing?

04:39.010 --> 04:41.172
I was looking for a quarter.

04:42.246 --> 04:44.545
I guess I came
at a good time then, huh?

04:44.615 --> 04:45.720
God! What are you doing here?

04:45.750 --> 04:47.412
You never said
you were coming to Detroit.

04:47.485 --> 04:49.954
- Oh, I got a last-minute job.
- Well, what are you gonna do?

04:50.021 --> 04:51.887
I'm photographing a magazine cover.

04:51.956 --> 04:54.653
I just thought I'd stop by
on my way to the hotel.

04:54.725 --> 04:57.752
- You are not staying at a hotel.
- Honey,

04:57.828 --> 04:59.592
she's a grown woman.

05:00.498 --> 05:03.832
If she wants to stay in a hotel,
who are we to stop her, huh?

05:03.901 --> 05:07.167
She is not staying at a hotel.
You can stay in Randy's room.

05:07.238 --> 05:10.111
But when you stay down there, you
gotta go all the way up to the bathroom

05:10.141 --> 05:13.080
and then you gotta jiggle the handle
of the toilet because it kind of runs.

05:13.110 --> 05:14.582
So, I should have Brad stay down
in Randy's room

05:14.612 --> 05:15.816
and you can stay up there in his room.

05:15.846 --> 05:16.905
- Great.
- Okay.

05:16.981 --> 05:18.472
Tim, is that okay?

05:18.549 --> 05:22.418
I have no idea what she just said.
But that's okay.

05:24.088 --> 05:26.250
Boy, I wish I could find a guy like him!

05:26.324 --> 05:27.324
Yeah.

05:27.391 --> 05:30.725
Well, Carrie, when they made me,
they broke the mold.

05:31.963 --> 05:34.125
I believe you broke the mold.

05:36.834 --> 05:41.397
The skin between every single one of
my toes is cracked, splitting and raw.

05:43.608 --> 05:45.975
Could you pass the creamed corn?

05:47.712 --> 05:48.839
There you go.

05:48.913 --> 05:51.940
I'll tell you, this fungus is painful.

05:52.016 --> 05:53.780
Not as painful as hearing about it.

05:53.851 --> 05:55.820
You know what's the worst?
Plantar's warts.

05:55.886 --> 05:59.345
You have to scrape that skin off
the inside of your toe...

05:59.423 --> 06:01.790
Okay, that's it. Dinner's over.
Time for the fight.

06:01.892 --> 06:03.326
- Yeah.
- What?

06:04.462 --> 06:05.555
Carrie, you're home early.

06:05.630 --> 06:09.192
Yeah. Am I glad that job's over!
My feet are killing me.

06:10.368 --> 06:12.132
Please, no more feet.

06:12.837 --> 06:14.328
Is Jeff here?

06:15.139 --> 06:16.163
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hi, Carrie.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.209
Oh, it's great to see you again.

06:18.275 --> 06:19.647
Great seeing you, too. You look terrific.

06:19.677 --> 06:20.940
Thanks. So do you.

06:21.012 --> 06:22.583
And thanks for sending me
those photographs

06:22.613 --> 06:24.081
from Tim's Fourth of July party.

06:24.148 --> 06:26.174
- Oh, we had a great time together.
- Oh, yeah.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.742
Until Tim almost shot
that bottle rocket up your...

06:28.819 --> 06:30.720
- Heineken anyone?
- Yeah.

06:31.989 --> 06:34.428
Nothing like a cold beer before a fight.
Come on. Let's sit down.

06:34.458 --> 06:37.826
- Oh, I love boxing! Who's fighting?
- Ironhead Johnson.

06:37.895 --> 06:39.989
Versus my man! You ready to rumble?

06:40.064 --> 06:45.162
From San Juan, Puerto Rico, Chi Chi
"The Mucho Macho" Hernandez!

06:46.437 --> 06:49.407
I hate boxing. It's bloody. It's vicious.

06:50.374 --> 06:52.809
Sounds like Jeff's last marriage.

06:53.577 --> 06:55.683
Yeah. Since the last time I saw you,
my wife and I split up.

06:55.713 --> 07:00.481
Yeah, Jill told me that she left you and
you're living with your mother again.

07:01.318 --> 07:03.480
Gee! Thanks for the build-up.

07:04.689 --> 07:06.809
I guess it lost a little something
in the translation.

07:06.857 --> 07:07.881
You think?

07:07.958 --> 07:10.894
- I'm really sorry, Jeff.
- Well, you know, these things happen.

07:10.961 --> 07:12.987
So, how long you gonna be
staying here?

07:13.064 --> 07:16.626
Well, my job's over and I really don't
have to be anywhere else for a week.

07:16.734 --> 07:17.997
A week?

07:22.006 --> 07:23.668
Hey, is that all?

07:26.677 --> 07:28.373
Chi Chi!

07:28.446 --> 07:31.507
Man, those body blows
are unbelievable!

07:31.582 --> 07:34.518
Twenty bucks says Chi Chi comes
out of this with a ruptured spleen.

07:34.585 --> 07:36.144
- You're on.
- Okay.

07:36.220 --> 07:39.679
I happen to know he lost his spleen
in the Lopez fight.

07:40.324 --> 07:42.418
That's why he's down a weight class.

07:42.493 --> 07:43.927
I can't stand this anymore.

07:43.994 --> 07:46.361
I'm gonna go upstairs and read.
Good night, guys.

07:46.464 --> 07:49.366
Was that a tooth
that flew out of his mouth?

07:50.234 --> 07:52.499
- Tonsil.
- Oh, man!

07:53.604 --> 07:54.970
Oh, this is great,

07:55.039 --> 07:58.669
I love watching sweaty, muscular guys
test their manhood.

08:00.745 --> 08:03.715
You know, in college I used to fight.

08:04.515 --> 08:05.778
You were a boxer?

08:05.850 --> 08:07.580
Well, I know my way
around the ring, yeah.

08:07.651 --> 08:10.985
They called you what,
"The Humongous Fungus," right?

08:12.823 --> 08:15.588
Get him, Itchy Toe! Hit him, Itchy Toe!
Come on, baby!

08:17.128 --> 08:19.654
Hey, what a fight! What a fight!

08:19.730 --> 08:22.825
Chi Chi must've stopped
87 shots with his head.

08:24.535 --> 08:27.403
- So, he lost again?
- No! No! Won the fight.

08:27.471 --> 08:29.235
It was on a technicality.
But a win is a win.

08:29.306 --> 08:32.606
I guess Ironhead's urine sample
came up a bit dirty.

08:32.876 --> 08:35.142
Please, spare me the details.
Did Jeff leave?

08:35.212 --> 08:37.909
No. He's down there
talking with Carrie.

08:46.924 --> 08:47.948
What are you doing?

08:48.025 --> 08:50.290
Hoping to log on to Windows 98.

08:52.963 --> 08:53.987
We can't be doing that.

08:54.064 --> 08:56.124
My sister's gonna be up here
any minute.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.224
So?

08:57.301 --> 09:00.999
So she'll be right next door.
And she's not a sound sleeper.

09:01.071 --> 09:04.599
- I don't think she'll be up for a while.
- How do you know that?

09:04.675 --> 09:08.203
Because Jeff is talking about shoes,
and feet.

09:09.580 --> 09:12.243
His feet, her feet, our family's feet.

09:12.950 --> 09:15.784
You know, if you took
a little whiff right here...

09:16.587 --> 09:20.080
You might become intoxicated
by the deep aroma of wood.

09:21.759 --> 09:23.694
- You think?
- I think so.

09:27.798 --> 09:30.165
That's Carrie!
You said she wouldn't be up here!

09:30.234 --> 09:32.669
Jeff probably took his socks off.

09:35.005 --> 09:38.134
Well, that's it. We can't do that now.

09:39.443 --> 09:42.880
- Why not?
- It'd be too weird. Yuck!

09:44.915 --> 09:46.850
It doesn't bother me.

09:46.917 --> 09:50.877
Well, you'd be comfortable doing it
with a relative in the room.

09:52.189 --> 09:55.751
If you're not comfortable
in front of family, why bother?

09:57.528 --> 10:01.556
I'm sorry, honey. But there's not
any sex happening here tonight.

10:08.105 --> 10:10.074
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

10:11.942 --> 10:13.171
Oh, no!

10:31.495 --> 10:34.988
I can't believe my sister's
in there with your brother.

10:38.502 --> 10:42.269
I can't believe my brother's feet
are touching those sheets.

10:44.341 --> 10:47.436
We're gonna have to boil those things,
you know.

10:48.479 --> 10:51.108
How could they be involved
with each other?

10:51.181 --> 10:53.343
Maybe they're not involved.

10:53.417 --> 10:56.581
Maybe they just stepped up here
for a quick boink.

10:59.189 --> 11:03.456
This is absolutely unbelievable.
They've been at it for almost an hour!

11:03.527 --> 11:06.656
I had no idea Jeff had
that kind of staying power.

11:06.730 --> 11:09.063
Jeff and Carrie,
of all people in the world?

11:09.133 --> 11:12.661
Well, some women go
for that bald look, you know?

11:12.736 --> 11:16.571
They stare in that shiny head
and they can fix their make-up.

11:18.075 --> 11:20.135
What would my sister
see in your brother?

11:20.211 --> 11:22.237
I just told you. Herself.

11:24.448 --> 11:27.384
No. I don't mean the bald thing.

11:27.451 --> 11:30.512
- You know, Jeff is just... He's so...
- So what?

11:31.488 --> 11:33.957
- Well, he can't keep a job... He can't...
- Oh, stop it...

11:34.024 --> 11:37.119
He's been divorced twice.
He's, you know, kind of uncouth.

11:37.194 --> 11:39.254
My brother reeks of couth.

11:41.298 --> 11:43.267
And what makes you think
Carrie's such a catch?

11:43.334 --> 11:45.269
Carrie? She's a great catch.

11:45.336 --> 11:48.075
She's an accomplished photographer.
She's cute. She's warm. She's funny.

11:48.105 --> 11:49.937
- She's a mooch.
- What?

11:51.809 --> 11:54.278
How does she always end up
staying here?

11:54.345 --> 11:57.372
She's always on her way to this
imaginary hotel of hers.

11:57.448 --> 11:59.576
The "Holiday Inn Her Mind."

12:02.052 --> 12:03.190
Oh, I don't want to argue about this.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.655
Look, Jeff is just the wrong guy
for my sister, okay?

12:05.723 --> 12:07.728
What you mean is
he's not good enough for your sister.

12:07.758 --> 12:10.387
- I never said that.
- But that's what you mean.

12:10.461 --> 12:12.020
Don't tell me what I mean.

12:12.129 --> 12:14.401
I don't need to tell you what you mean,
you know what you mean.

12:14.431 --> 12:16.764
I do know what I mean.
And it's not what you think I mean.

12:16.834 --> 12:18.505
And who are you to tell me
what I mean, anyway?

12:18.535 --> 12:21.630
Half the time you don't even know
what you mean!

12:22.172 --> 12:25.006
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What do you think it means?

12:25.075 --> 12:27.147
I don't know. I'm not even sure
what the original topic is.

12:27.177 --> 12:30.079
- My sister. Your brother.
- What? Yes!

12:32.583 --> 12:35.018
You think your family's
better than my family.

12:35.085 --> 12:37.213
That is so untrue. I love your mother.

12:37.287 --> 12:39.126
I'm not talking about my mother.
How about my brothers?

12:39.156 --> 12:40.522
Your brothers are fine.

12:40.591 --> 12:43.686
Not as fine as your couthy,
intelligent sisters.

12:43.761 --> 12:46.663
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You think my brother's a lowbrow.

12:46.730 --> 12:48.665
- I never said that.
- That's what you mean.

12:48.732 --> 12:52.294
- You have no idea what I mean.
- Let's not go there again.

12:53.470 --> 12:56.176
You look down on my brothers because
you think they're unsophisticated.

12:56.206 --> 12:58.641
And when you look down on them,
you look down on me.

12:58.709 --> 13:00.214
I do not. You are being so ridiculous.

13:00.244 --> 13:01.782
I'm just not even gonna
talk to you anymore.

13:01.812 --> 13:04.338
Oh, that'll last about five minutes.

13:04.948 --> 13:07.354
If I had a nickel for every time you
talked to me after you said

13:07.384 --> 13:09.490
you weren't gonna talk to me again,
I'd be a millionaire.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.955
- Oh, please!
- There's a dime right there.

13:14.758 --> 13:16.989
Oh, look who came up for air!

13:19.163 --> 13:22.531
Hi, Carrie and I were just upstairs.
She was showing me her...

13:22.633 --> 13:23.704
- Photographs.
- Photographs.

13:23.734 --> 13:26.636
- That's what you're calling them now?
- Yeah.

13:28.138 --> 13:30.835
Jeff's just gonna take me out
to grab a bite to eat.

13:30.908 --> 13:32.137
See ya.

13:33.877 --> 13:36.506
Well, looks like another Patterson
woman lowered herself

13:36.580 --> 13:38.742
to the level of a Taylor man.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.651
You are such a jackass.

13:42.286 --> 13:43.286
Let's see...

13:45.923 --> 13:47.892
Jackass one or two words?

13:51.695 --> 13:53.061
Welcome back to
"Woodworking Week"

13:53.130 --> 13:56.066
and our special segment
on dents, defects and gouges.

13:56.133 --> 13:59.297
Now, we've just showed you
how to inlay knots to cover blemishes.

13:59.403 --> 14:03.966
Since we're done working on Al's face,
we can now start on this nice table.

14:04.575 --> 14:07.135
Okay, say you have a lacquered
or varnished table...

14:07.244 --> 14:10.009
You have a lacquered
or varnished table.

14:10.948 --> 14:13.611
With a small dent in it. Doink!

14:13.684 --> 14:14.982
Not to worry.

14:15.052 --> 14:18.420
No need to sand off the finish to
restore this table to its natural beauty.

14:18.489 --> 14:22.654
No, no, no. We're gonna show you
a process that we call "doping in."

14:22.960 --> 14:25.191
Doping in can be done
in one of two ways.

14:25.262 --> 14:27.595
You can stick Tim into the dent.

14:32.002 --> 14:35.837
Or you can apply a small drop
of the same finish into the dent

14:35.906 --> 14:38.273
- with a toothpick or a small brush.
- That's right.

14:38.375 --> 14:41.641
And once it dries, just repeat
the process until your dent is filled.

14:41.712 --> 14:45.945
- Now, moving on to a larger project...
- We've got Al's mom's TV tray.

14:50.687 --> 14:52.246
Still moving on.

14:53.023 --> 14:54.389
Now, take a look here.

14:54.458 --> 14:58.020
If you have a prominent crack,
perhaps it's spreading...

15:01.999 --> 15:03.763
Moving on again.

15:04.368 --> 15:06.208
You can keep this crack
from getting any bigger

15:06.270 --> 15:08.762
by installing a decorative butterfly key.

15:08.839 --> 15:11.673
Like one of these ones
I carved earlier today.

15:11.742 --> 15:14.268
- Well, Tim, that's made of ash.
- I know.

15:14.344 --> 15:16.506
Well, our table is made of
bird's-eye maple.

15:16.613 --> 15:19.276
- They're from two different families.
- So what?

15:19.349 --> 15:22.046
Well, ash is a coarse grain
and maple's a fine grain.

15:22.119 --> 15:24.679
They just... They don't go together.

15:25.823 --> 15:28.349
Are you saying your wood
is better than my wood?

15:28.425 --> 15:29.586
No.

15:29.693 --> 15:31.924
Your wood is classier
and more intelligent than my wood?

15:31.995 --> 15:33.361
What are you talking about?

15:33.430 --> 15:37.333
I'm talking about people
that look down on other people's wood.

15:38.802 --> 15:41.499
Maybe your maple
could just kiss my ash.

15:45.175 --> 15:46.268
Okay.

15:47.044 --> 15:48.882
What I would use for
a decorative butterfly would be...

15:48.912 --> 15:50.317
I'm not finished yet.
I'm not finished yet.

15:50.347 --> 15:53.408
You know, just because a wood is
coarse and unfinished

15:53.483 --> 15:55.918
doesn't make it inferior.

15:55.986 --> 15:59.150
You know, I believe this country was
founded on the principle

15:59.256 --> 16:03.284
that all wood has the inalienable right
to become a nice cabinet!

16:13.236 --> 16:14.474
What exactly is your point, Tim?

16:14.504 --> 16:20.466
I mean that all wood is created equal,
regardless of color, creed or burl.

16:22.045 --> 16:24.480
And fourscore and seven tables ago...

16:24.548 --> 16:26.449
We'll be right back to
"Woodworking Week"

16:26.516 --> 16:28.644
after we medicate our host.

16:41.298 --> 16:43.665
- Hey, Wilson.
- Hi-ho, Jill.

16:43.734 --> 16:47.171
- What are you doing?
- I am celebrating <i>Yabusame.</i>

16:47.237 --> 16:50.264
You know, at <i>Yabusame</i> time in Japan,
members of the Shinto religion

16:50.340 --> 16:55.108
shoot arrows to expel evil influences
and resolve long-standing quarrels.

16:58.081 --> 17:02.519
Well, if you have any extra arrows,
you ought to send one over here.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.487
Problem, neighbor-san?

17:05.888 --> 17:09.826
My sister Carrie started seeing
Tim's brother Jeff.

17:09.893 --> 17:11.862
We won't go into the how, when
and where of that.

17:11.962 --> 17:16.332
But I didn't think it was a good match.
Tim got all sensitive about it,

17:16.400 --> 17:20.337
accused me of looking down
on his family.

17:20.404 --> 17:21.633
Well, why did he do that?

17:21.704 --> 17:22.968
I have no idea.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.737
I have always been the one
who defended his family.

17:25.809 --> 17:27.573
- To whom?
- My family.

17:29.212 --> 17:30.874
Well, you know, my dad.

17:30.948 --> 17:34.976
- Oh, yes! The Colonel!
- He was a very opinionated man.

17:35.052 --> 17:37.412
- Judged everybody according to rank.
- Oh, I remember that.

17:37.454 --> 17:40.083
Used to call Tim
"Corporal Punishment."

17:41.258 --> 17:44.820
Well, then he promoted him to
"Major Butt-head."

17:44.895 --> 17:47.267
I never wanted to be like my dad.
You know, look down on people.

17:47.297 --> 17:49.469
That's why I've always been
very accepting of Tim's brothers.

17:49.499 --> 17:51.934
Accepting of Tim's brothers?

17:52.002 --> 17:55.370
If you're trying to imply that Tim's right,
you are way, way off base.

17:55.472 --> 17:59.739
If I was that judgmental, I never would
have married someone like Tim.

18:02.813 --> 18:06.545
"Someone like Tim." Oh, my God!
Listen to me.

18:07.884 --> 18:10.376
I've become my father
without the scowl.

18:10.454 --> 18:13.356
Jill, everybody picks up
certain negative characteristics

18:13.423 --> 18:14.447
from their parents.

18:14.524 --> 18:17.030
Yeah, well, I knew I picked up negative
characteristics from my mother.

18:17.060 --> 18:18.532
I didn't know I'd gotten them
from my father, too.

18:18.562 --> 18:19.866
- That hardly seems fair.
- Right there.

18:19.896 --> 18:23.025
See, now, by identifying them, you
make the first step to overcoming them.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.571
You know, it took me years of
hard work to get rid of

18:24.601 --> 18:25.721
my father's annoying traits.

18:25.769 --> 18:28.295
- Really? What was he like?
- Odd man.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.731
Kept to himself.

18:31.808 --> 18:34.778
Never really let people see
the whole person.

18:41.318 --> 18:43.412
- You look great.
- Thanks.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.048
Jeff's taking me to Sorrentino's
for dinner.

18:46.123 --> 18:47.250
Whoa!

18:48.358 --> 18:51.590
So, you two really seem to be
hitting it off, huh?

18:52.496 --> 18:53.862
Well, yeah.

18:53.930 --> 18:57.367
We had a great time together
yesterday, although...

18:59.169 --> 19:00.694
Although what?

19:01.671 --> 19:03.640
Well, Jeff's a nice guy.

19:04.307 --> 19:06.469
But he's had all those
business failures.

19:06.576 --> 19:08.545
He never even finished college.

19:08.645 --> 19:11.012
He's obsessed with his feet.

19:13.350 --> 19:15.285
- What do you think of him?
- Jeff?

19:15.352 --> 19:16.718
Yeah.

19:16.787 --> 19:20.417
I think he's a sweet and decent guy.

19:21.491 --> 19:22.857
That's what I thought.

19:22.959 --> 19:24.998
And then last night
when he dropped me off, you know,

19:25.028 --> 19:27.122
I just started picking him apart.

19:27.197 --> 19:30.656
That critical voice you're hearing,
you know where you get that?

19:30.734 --> 19:32.362
It's from Daddy.

19:32.803 --> 19:34.032
What do you mean?

19:34.104 --> 19:37.734
You remember how he used to put
everybody under the microscope?

19:37.807 --> 19:41.266
If you examine anybody that closely,
you're gonna find flaws.

19:41.344 --> 19:44.109
Maybe you should give Jeff a chance.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.182
I think you're right.

19:46.249 --> 19:49.515
Especially since you're
already sleeping with him.

19:50.487 --> 19:53.321
- We did not sleep together!
- Oh, really?

19:53.390 --> 19:55.723
No! Well, we started kissing.

19:55.792 --> 19:59.126
And then I remembered
my sister was right next door.

20:01.965 --> 20:03.337
Of course, Jeff could've cared less.

20:03.367 --> 20:05.734
He would've been fine
with the door open.

20:05.836 --> 20:07.998
Tim would do it on <i>Tool Time.</i>

20:12.642 --> 20:15.373
Now, listen! Listen!
Ignore that critical voice.

20:15.445 --> 20:16.811
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:18.648 --> 20:23.018
- He's been divorced twice.
- I met both of them. He's better off.

20:23.353 --> 20:25.584
- Go! Go, go, go!
- Okay. Coming!

20:28.491 --> 20:31.120
- Hi, Jeff.
- How're you doing?

20:31.194 --> 20:32.218
Hey, good news.

20:32.295 --> 20:35.015
After our romantic dinner, we're going
to "Fight Night" at Cobo Hall.

20:35.065 --> 20:38.092
- Well, that's fantastic.
- Yeah. And I got you this.

20:38.168 --> 20:41.730
- Oh, you're so sweet.
- Yes, I am.

20:41.805 --> 20:43.740
Guys, have a good time.

20:47.043 --> 20:50.013
I saw Jeff's car.
Where's he taking Carrie?

20:50.080 --> 20:51.571
Dinner and a fight.

20:54.284 --> 20:56.947
Sounds like Friday night at our house.

20:58.121 --> 20:59.487
Okay, okay.

21:00.757 --> 21:04.922
I was wrong to be so judgmental of Jeff.

21:04.995 --> 21:06.657
Wow! You were judgmental?

21:08.231 --> 21:11.599
It was that Patterson family gene
just seeping through.

21:11.668 --> 21:15.730
I mean, you guys may be a little
rough around the edges, but, hey...

21:15.805 --> 21:17.569
What's the surprise? You're men.

21:19.476 --> 21:23.538
And for men, you're very open,
accepting and caring people.

21:23.914 --> 21:26.474
Plus we're really good at Skee-Ball.

21:27.784 --> 21:32.916
I think that if Jeff happens to fall in love
with Carrie, she'd be lucky to have him.

21:34.691 --> 21:36.182
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.786
Where are the boys?

21:38.862 --> 21:40.387
At the movies.

21:45.569 --> 21:48.505
How would you like to
crack open that window?

21:52.242 --> 21:53.540
Hey, Wilson?

21:53.610 --> 21:56.705
Hidey-holy henna!
What happened to your head?

21:56.780 --> 21:58.806
I just saw Al's mom naked.

22:00.183 --> 22:02.243
- Look, Tim, that's made of ash.
- I know that.

22:02.319 --> 22:06.256
And this table is made of
bird's-eye marble. They're... Marble?

22:08.825 --> 22:09.825
Yes!
