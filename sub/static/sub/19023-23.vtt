00:05.506 --> 00:08.926
<i>Oh, my God, I can't
believe I'm about to do this.</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:10.385
What's wrong?

00:11.345 --> 00:13.972
- l lost my mop.
- Really?

00:14.056 --> 00:17.851
No. But that's the only thing
that could make me unhappy, right?

00:17.935 --> 00:20.812
You people think of me
as nothing but The Janitor.

00:20.896 --> 00:24.107
- That's not true.
- What's my name?

00:25.734 --> 00:29.112
l know that the nurses
call you Sir Plunge-a-lot.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.281
- l know.
- Come on.

00:31.365 --> 00:35.452
- l'm sure you don't know my name so...
- John Michael Dorian.

00:35.536 --> 00:39.790
- How did you know my middle name?
- Because l care.

00:39.873 --> 00:43.710
<i>Today seems like a good day to
hide out in one of my patient's rooms.</i>

00:43.794 --> 00:46.129
You, my friend,
are an incompetent fool!

00:46.213 --> 00:48.632
<i>Unless, of course,
my patient is missing.</i>

00:48.715 --> 00:50.467
Where's my brother?

00:50.551 --> 00:55.973
Say, ''l don't know,'' l'll show you what
l learned in my crotch-punching class.

00:56.056 --> 01:00.018
l think it's great that
you're going back to school.

01:00.102 --> 01:04.188
Why would he wander off?
Oh, maybe he went to a real hospital.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.441
He found out
he had leukaemia yesterday.

01:06.525 --> 01:10.237
That's life-changing news. You
can't be surprised if he's depressed.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.489
Hey, doc!

01:12.573 --> 01:15.534
This guy's got something
on his shoulder. Take a look.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.495
Ben, put the small children down.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.330
ls anybody missing one of these?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.416
OK!

01:22.499 --> 01:24.877
You heard the doctor.
Sit this one out.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.920
- Please...
- My hands are free to...

01:27.004 --> 01:29.882
No, no, Ben! Seriously, Ben!
Ben! No, come on, Ben!

01:29.965 --> 01:32.968
Stop, Ben. Put me down. Ben!

01:33.051 --> 01:36.555
Faster!

01:39.016 --> 01:40.517
Eagle!

01:41.602 --> 01:44.313
You had enough?

01:47.649 --> 01:49.902
- Sad.
- You want a turn?

01:49.985 --> 01:54.072
- Come on.
- Don't you dare! Don't you dare! No!

01:54.156 --> 01:57.784
- No! Ben, put me down! No!
- Get a shot of the mean lady.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.579
Hey, shorty.
You short person,

02:00.662 --> 02:05.042
you take that picture, you'll be glad
you're in a hospital. Help!

02:19.640 --> 02:22.184
You've got
a Christmas card right there.

02:22.267 --> 02:26.021
You're funny. l don't understand why
you refuse to put on a gown.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.774
Because l don't
like people to see my bum.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.693
- So wear underwear.
- You know how l feel about underwear.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.238
Every girl who came to our
house in the mid-'80s

02:34.321 --> 02:36.990
- knows how you feel.
- Sweatpants years.

02:37.074 --> 02:41.119
l don't like that much freedom down
there. Makes me tingle in my giblets.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.622
lf you don't
start taking this seriously...

02:43.705 --> 02:47.709
<i>I'm a good intern, but when
you're dealing with disease and family,</i>

02:47.793 --> 02:50.587
<i>an intern just doesn't cut it.
What you need...</i>

02:51.880 --> 02:52.923
<i>...is a hero.</i>

02:53.006 --> 02:56.051
Shut up. Shut up.
And definitely shut up.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.553
But, l didn't say any...

02:57.636 --> 03:01.014
l know, but l enjoy saying it to you.
OK, here's the deal.

03:01.098 --> 03:04.059
lf we're gonna beat this thing,
and we damn sure are,

03:04.142 --> 03:06.061
we'll do it one way
and one way only:

03:06.144 --> 03:10.065
- We're gonna be a team, team, team.
- l hear you, Dr Cox.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.151
l am so not speaking to you,
Rhonda, thank you.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.195
l'm sorry, l'm very excited. Go!

03:15.279 --> 03:17.906
What do you say, children?
Are we a team?

03:17.990 --> 03:20.450
l'm in.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.578
Go Team Cancer.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.538
<i>Wow, he did it.</i>

03:24.621 --> 03:27.624
l've got to go take care
of some other patients.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.715
l don't believe it. l didn't
get tomorrow's Whipple procedure.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.633
- l know.
- This is ridiculous.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.759
Calm down.

03:37.843 --> 03:42.723
What's a brother got to do to get a
Whipple? What's a brother got to do?

03:42.806 --> 03:46.101
Listen. You've got to stop
turning your medical training

03:46.185 --> 03:50.397
into some ego-driven contest.
No one else is doing that.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.941
Oh, l got the Whipple.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.943
Suck it, Turk.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.571
- l will end her.
- No, no.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.448
- Dude, let her go.
- Let go of me.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.950
lt'll be so hot.

04:02.034 --> 04:07.789
Can you tell me the treatment regimen
for organophosphate toxicity, Dr Reid?

04:07.873 --> 04:10.042
l would give
intramuscular epinephrine,

04:10.125 --> 04:13.420
then lV calcium gluconate,
and emergency haemodialysis.

04:13.504 --> 04:17.007
lf l wanted you
to give me three wrong answers in a row

04:17.089 --> 04:20.469
l would have just asked
for ''the usual.''

04:20.552 --> 04:22.429
Dr Murphy, care to jump in?

04:22.513 --> 04:24.973
l think it's...

04:25.057 --> 04:27.726
- Do you have a speech impediment?
- Excuse me?

04:27.809 --> 04:30.854
You insist on starting
every answer with ''um.''

04:30.938 --> 04:33.357
So you've either got a speech impediment

04:33.440 --> 04:37.277
or you're a stammering know-nothing
who doesn't belong in medicine.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.863
Well spoken.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.241
Now, get out!
All of you! Get out!

04:42.324 --> 04:44.201
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

04:45.744 --> 04:48.872
Jumpin' Jupiter,
l do enjoy the tough love.

04:48.956 --> 04:52.167
They probably like it too,
whether they admit it or not.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.211
Well...

04:54.294 --> 04:59.341
''Oh, the old guy's so tough on me,
but l love him.'' Right?

04:59.424 --> 05:02.302
Right? They hate you, Bob.

05:02.386 --> 05:05.806
They hate you from your hooves
to the top of your pitchfork.

05:05.889 --> 05:10.435
They hate you,
dear God, they hate you good.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.020
What're you laughing at?

05:12.104 --> 05:16.108
That ''hooves'' and ''pitchfork'' part.

05:16.191 --> 05:19.319
- Why?
- No reason.

05:21.071 --> 05:25.534
Now, do you think you can make
Ben behave like a patient or not?

05:25.617 --> 05:27.744
No problem.

05:28.871 --> 05:32.166
- l got him to put his gown on.
- He sure did.

05:32.249 --> 05:35.502
And now my butt itches on
account of this scratchy chair.

05:35.586 --> 05:36.920
What're we watching?

05:37.004 --> 05:41.466
<i>Wings. And shut up,
l like the cab driver. He slays me.</i>

05:41.550 --> 05:44.178
Antonio. Played by
the actor Tony Shalhoub,

05:44.261 --> 05:47.347
<i>also particularly fantastic
in a film called Big Night.</i>

05:47.431 --> 05:51.059
Congratulations. Your DiMaggio-like
streak for saying nothing

05:51.143 --> 05:55.772
even remotely interesting
is still alive and well.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.983
<i>I didn't care about the abuse.</i>

05:58.066 --> 06:01.945
<i>The most amazing thing was to
watch how Dr Cox dealt with his friend.</i>

06:02.029 --> 06:04.031
<i>How he made him feel safe.</i>

06:04.114 --> 06:07.534
- Do l have to get a special doctor?
- An oncologist.

06:07.618 --> 06:11.038
Do we have to talk about this? You
must have something else on your mind.

06:11.121 --> 06:15.626
Nope. Just pretty much
that leukaemia thing.

06:15.709 --> 06:19.963
Ben, leukaemia is a petty, ugly illness

06:20.047 --> 06:22.466
and we'll not dignify it
by speaking of it

06:22.549 --> 06:25.761
unless absolutely necessary.
ls that clear to you?

06:25.844 --> 06:27.387
Gotcha.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.143
You are such a stud.

06:33.227 --> 06:36.271
That was interesting.

06:36.355 --> 06:38.357
So, Doctor Wen.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.777
You asked Bonnie to assist you
with this Whipple procedure?

06:41.860 --> 06:45.447
- Yes, l did.
- Thanks again, sir.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.412
l guess we should just let it go.

06:52.496 --> 06:57.626
l mean, neither one of us wants to
do anything to make it worse, right?

06:59.753 --> 07:02.047
You guys ever notice
how you're both Asian?

07:05.259 --> 07:08.178
Your mother's maiden name is Turner.

07:08.262 --> 07:13.350
So you used your key to get
into my personnel file. Big deal.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.353
Your first kiss was with Sarah Briggs

07:16.436 --> 07:19.231
at the embarrassing age of 1 6.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.941
She wore a green turtleneck.

07:21.024 --> 07:25.612
You wonder sometimes if she still
thinks about you. l'm guessing no.

07:25.696 --> 07:29.992
- How could you possibly know that?
- l'm your father.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.794
Good morning, Dr Dorian.

07:40.878 --> 07:45.716
You probably don't notice it yourself,
but this hospital is a freak show.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.301
This is my band.

07:47.384 --> 07:51.513
We're all working from different
departments in the hospital.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.557
<i>- Legal
- Accounting</i>

07:53.640 --> 07:56.393
<i>- Shipping and Receiving
- Online Property Management</i>

07:56.476 --> 07:58.854
<i>Including Pest Control
Night Time Security</i>

07:58.937 --> 08:01.273
<i>And Non-Arboreal
Gardening Services</i>

08:03.734 --> 08:05.444
That's... That's just great.

08:05.527 --> 08:09.573
We mostly do a cappella versions
of cartoon theme songs.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.928
Dr Reid, l hope
l wasn't too harsh on you

08:31.011 --> 08:33.639
- at rounds this morning.
- Oh, it's OK, sir.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.015
l don't hate myself much
more than usual.

08:36.099 --> 08:41.063
Well, turnabout's fair play, and all
that, so here's an evaluation form.

08:41.145 --> 08:44.733
l figured l'd try to get a read
on how all you interns think l'm doing.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.777
Don't sign your name.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.531
lt's completely anonymous,
and Dr Reid, l'm no she-doc.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.783
l can take it.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.580
- You're going to crush him, right?
- Oh, yes.

08:58.664 --> 09:01.208
- How do you spell ''inadequate''?
- Give me that.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.418
l'll fill it out for you.

09:03.502 --> 09:06.463
So, Mr Sullivan,
your blast percentage

09:06.547 --> 09:09.800
is quite a bit higher than we
all expected. Around 80 percent.

09:09.883 --> 09:14.346
That's bad, right? You want the number
to be low, huh? Like in golf?

09:14.429 --> 09:18.350
Yes, exactly.
Like in golf. Do you play?

09:18.433 --> 09:21.186
Oh, who the hell cares
if he plays golf?

09:21.270 --> 09:22.604
l was bonding.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.398
You're doing a good job too.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.899
Oh, thanks.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.442
Who is this clown?

09:27.526 --> 09:30.237
Paul here is the best
oncologist in the room,

09:30.320 --> 09:32.990
so why don't we all
just clam up and listen.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.827
- We need to start chemo.
- When?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.495
This afternoon.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.499
l'm afraid this afternoon
doesn't work for me.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.877
lronically, l have
a golf game to get to.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.005
Benji, don't sweat it.
Come on, give me a break.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.423
You gonna be there?

09:49.506 --> 09:52.426
l've got a thousand patients
to look after, so no,

09:52.509 --> 09:55.220
l'll probably miss this
first one, but l will leave

09:55.304 --> 09:58.807
my lovely and talented
assistant, Kimmy, OK?

09:59.850 --> 10:02.436
Yeah, sure, you know, OK.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.564
- Oh, am l Kimmy?
- No, l'm Kimmy.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.983
Oh! Good.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.157
Carla torched Dr Kelso for me.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.995
No matter what l wrote, l always
brought it back to sexual inadequacy.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.998
- So good.
- Hello, ladies.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.833
- Hey, Doug.
- Hey, Doug.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.127
What did you write
on Kelso's evaluation?

10:27.211 --> 10:29.755
- What evaluation?
- You didn't get yours yet?

10:29.838 --> 10:31.673
Nobody got one.

10:35.594 --> 10:38.388
<i>Around here, bad behaviour
comes back to haunt you.</i>

10:38.472 --> 10:40.641
Dr Wen, l want
to take this opportunity

10:40.724 --> 10:45.437
to once again apologise to you
and the entire Asian community.

10:45.521 --> 10:48.440
l'll pass it on
at the next big meeting.

10:48.524 --> 10:49.858
You know, Christopher,

10:49.942 --> 10:54.404
surgeons don't have to be
shallow, rank-obsessed clichés.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.907
So who's the best surgical intern?

10:56.990 --> 11:02.079
ls it Bonnie? ls it me?
Come on, l just, l gotta know.

11:02.162 --> 11:07.334
The periampullary carcinoma patient
had a failed stenting of the bile duct.

11:07.417 --> 11:11.213
l wanna prep him for a pylorus
sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.881
Thanks.

11:12.965 --> 11:16.927
Wassup, T-Man!
Show the Todd some love.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.600
Ben seemed
pretty down after you left,

11:23.684 --> 11:26.019
so l could cover
and you could hang out.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.188
You're a lamb,
but you don't have to.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.649
- l don't mind. lt's...
- Newbie, stop.

11:30.732 --> 11:34.736
<i>It's funny how people
handle bad news in different ways.</i>

11:37.239 --> 11:40.200
<i>Some people have
a visceral reaction.</i>

11:42.870 --> 11:45.914
Time to get my soapy-soap on.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.749
<i>Some people go into denial.</i>

11:47.833 --> 11:49.418
No way.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.336
<i>And others...</i>

11:51.420 --> 11:55.007
What chance do you give a guy
with Ben's blast percentage? Huh?

11:55.090 --> 11:57.384
Twenty percent?
Thirty...maybe?

11:57.467 --> 12:00.012
You see, l can't handle that.
l cannot.

12:01.305 --> 12:04.099
So, no thank you there, Johnny.

12:05.684 --> 12:09.313
<i>Others just walk away.</i>

12:13.150 --> 12:14.985
<i>Chemotherapy looks harmless,</i>

12:15.068 --> 12:17.779
<i>but it's poison pumped
directly into your veins.</i>

12:17.863 --> 12:20.407
Every time l got
sick when l was a little kid,

12:20.490 --> 12:23.619
- Mom would get me a Tonka truck.
- Yeah, so?

12:23.702 --> 12:25.829
So where's my Tonka truck?

12:29.166 --> 12:32.419
- Score.
- The earth-mover. Can l see?

12:32.503 --> 12:36.673
Ah, see it with your eyes, man,
not with your hands. See?

12:36.757 --> 12:39.259
l can't believe Perry
bailed on you. Typical.

12:39.343 --> 12:42.179
He's always out the door
if things get too real.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.265
<i>This is the true story.</i>

12:45.349 --> 12:47.392
True story!

12:47.476 --> 12:50.729
<i>Of four people,
forced to hang out in a hospital.</i>

12:50.812 --> 12:53.857
<i>To find out what happens
when people stop being polite...</i>

12:53.941 --> 12:56.610
<i>And start being real.</i>

12:59.821 --> 13:03.784
- He didn't bail.
- lf he did, he's a total wuss.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.337
You said you were giving
evaluations to all the interns.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.297
Well, not all at once, sweetheart.

13:17.381 --> 13:20.676
With your way there'd be no
accountability. No back and forth.

13:20.759 --> 13:24.179
You wouldn't have to
explain to me why, let's see...

13:24.263 --> 13:26.181
...''l'm most likely frustrated

13:26.265 --> 13:29.810
because l haven't gotten any
since the Bay of Pigs.''

13:29.893 --> 13:32.896
Oh, sir, l'm so sorry.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.857
Are we cool?

13:34.940 --> 13:37.943
What could have
possessed you to write such filth?

13:38.026 --> 13:40.028
l need to tell you something...

13:40.112 --> 13:43.907
No, that's OK, Carla,
l'm gonna take care of that patient.

13:44.950 --> 13:48.453
Dr Kelso, l did it because l didn't
think that you'd know it was me

13:48.537 --> 13:50.747
and l thought that it would be funny.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.833
Let's take a walk.

13:52.916 --> 13:58.213
l'd like to tell you a few things
that l think are funny.

14:02.384 --> 14:05.846
Oh, come on, how could
this guy be the best?

14:05.929 --> 14:08.557
You want to know
the difference between you?

14:08.640 --> 14:12.060
When you're working l can
always see your wheels turning.

14:12.144 --> 14:14.938
You're thinking about what to do next,
what could go wrong.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.315
You're not in the moment.

14:16.398 --> 14:21.612
And as much as it pains me
to say this, the Todd is.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.948
<i>Please. Just because I'm thorough</i>

14:25.032 --> 14:27.242
<i>and want to keep two
Kelly clamps on</i>

14:27.326 --> 14:30.120
<i>in case the appendiceal artery
is inadvertently incised</i>

14:30.204 --> 14:35.667
<i>so I can gain immediate haemostatic
control doesn't mean I think too much.</i>

14:35.751 --> 14:37.753
<i>Shiny scalpel</i>

14:37.836 --> 14:41.465
<i>Dum de de dum, de de dum
De de dum, gonna slice him up</i>

14:43.342 --> 14:45.928
- You're afraid of escalators.
- That's not uncommon.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.096
You like feel of cashmere
on your skin.

14:48.180 --> 14:51.308
- How are you doing this?
- That's right, you run away!

14:51.391 --> 14:54.019
Run away from the truth!

14:54.102 --> 14:57.022
Look, Dr Cox, l've been
doing a lot of thinking,

14:57.105 --> 15:01.818
and l think the only reason you're
not down at that hospital right now

15:01.902 --> 15:03.987
is that you're afraid.

15:04.071 --> 15:08.242
l think you're right. l do.

15:08.325 --> 15:12.621
That's partly because you've
really gotten to know me this year,

15:12.704 --> 15:16.625
but mostly it's because, well...

15:16.708 --> 15:19.086
...l told you that
l was afraid earlier.

15:19.169 --> 15:22.047
Don't tell me you've come here
to reiterate things

15:22.130 --> 15:25.384
l've already said, because
l know the things that l've said.

15:25.467 --> 15:29.513
ln fact, l'm the one who said them.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.558
You've got to get back
in the game, Coxie.

15:32.641 --> 15:35.811
''Coxie'' was a mistake.
Pretend l didn't say Coxie.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.312
Get out.

15:37.396 --> 15:41.149
Look, l... lt boggles my mind
that you would just bail on a patient.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.610
A patient is a stranger in a bed

15:43.694 --> 15:46.446
that you can distance yourself
from when you need to.

15:46.530 --> 15:50.409
Ben is my friend.

15:50.492 --> 15:53.579
l'm gonna try to visit him
over the next couple of weeks,

15:53.662 --> 15:58.208
but if l can't,
then that'll be very sad for me,

15:58.292 --> 16:03.046
but really,
it'll just mean that l'm human.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.341
Oh, and newbie,

16:06.425 --> 16:10.554
please don't think that you've
come here because Ben needs me.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.514
You're here because
you're scared

16:12.598 --> 16:15.893
that you might have to rely
on yourself for the first time.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.644
And that...

16:17.728 --> 16:22.816
That is just the
saddest thing of all.

16:28.614 --> 16:33.076
<i>I think one of the most universal
human experiences is feeling alone.</i>

16:33.160 --> 16:35.954
<i>You'd never know,
but there's tons of people</i>

16:36.038 --> 16:39.124
<i>feeling the exact same way.</i>

16:39.208 --> 16:42.878
<i>Maybe because you're
feeling completely abandoned.</i>

16:42.961 --> 16:47.799
<i>Maybe you realised that you aren't
as self-sufficient as you thought.</i>

16:47.883 --> 16:51.261
<i>Maybe you know you should've
handled something differently.</i>

16:51.345 --> 16:54.139
<i>Or maybe you aren't
as good as you thought you were.</i>

16:54.223 --> 16:57.059
<i>Either way, when you hit
that low point, you have a choice.</i>

16:57.142 --> 17:01.813
<i>You can either wallow
in self-pity or you can suck it up.</i>

17:03.065 --> 17:05.442
<i>It's your call.</i>

17:07.194 --> 17:10.696
You know what, Dr Wen? l don't care
if l'm not the best right now,

17:10.781 --> 17:13.242
because l'm all about the upside,
and one day,

17:13.325 --> 17:16.453
l'm going to own this place.
That's right. All of this here,

17:16.537 --> 17:18.079
all of this right here

17:18.163 --> 17:19.915
is gonna be
the Chris Turk Wing.

17:25.712 --> 17:32.344
Dr Kelso, l wrote that evaluation.
lt was me. Elliot didn't write a word.

17:32.427 --> 17:35.597
But l would've written every word
if l'd had the courage...

17:35.681 --> 17:38.892
...and the other-side-of-the-tracks
upbringing Carla did.

17:38.976 --> 17:41.895
- You want to know what l think of you?
- You tell him.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.901
You're mean.

17:47.985 --> 17:52.948
<i>As for me, I decided
that if Dr Cox couldn't do it,</i>

17:53.031 --> 17:55.742
<i>well then, I would have
to be the one there for Ben.</i>

18:27.107 --> 18:30.068
- Oh, thank God.
- Goodbye, newbie.

18:30.152 --> 18:35.115
So, you know, what's up?

18:35.199 --> 18:38.327
You know, this and that.
Hey, l met someone.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.120
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:40.204 --> 18:43.707
But she took a stool sample
so l think she works here.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.794
Redhead? Tall?

18:47.878 --> 18:51.507
- Not on the staff, no.
- No?

18:51.590 --> 18:53.509
What a strange young lady.

18:53.592 --> 18:55.385
Are we just gonna sit around here

18:55.469 --> 18:58.805
and make jokes the rest of the day?
ls that the drill?

18:58.889 --> 19:04.269
Listen, if it makes you uncomfortable,
then you can just bolt again.

19:04.353 --> 19:07.481
l think it's only fair you hear
my end of the story there.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.816
All right, fine.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.451
Aw, man, l love you,

19:19.535 --> 19:22.663
but you're a complete wuss.

19:22.746 --> 19:25.916
l guess l got a little scared.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.502
Well, let me know
if there's anything l can do

19:28.585 --> 19:30.879
to help you through this rough patch.

19:30.963 --> 19:34.049
Give me a break. l'm not
good at this stuff. You know that.

19:34.132 --> 19:37.219
- lt's OK.
- l don't like the big conversations.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.096
lt's cool.

19:44.977 --> 19:47.396
l've been thinking
about death a lot lately.

19:47.479 --> 19:50.566
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

19:50.649 --> 19:53.735
You think it's like New York,
you know...

19:53.819 --> 19:57.114
<i>To most people it might
have seemed like nothing had changed.</i>

19:58.073 --> 20:00.075
Well, Dr Murphy?

20:05.455 --> 20:08.500
<i>- But it had a little.
- Go on.</i>

20:08.584 --> 20:11.253
Could it be lupus?

20:13.046 --> 20:15.007
Good job, sport.

20:28.145 --> 20:32.941
<i>As for Ben, he actually responded
to the chemo and went into remission.</i>

20:33.025 --> 20:35.944
<i>Hopefully he won't be back,
but who knows?</i>

20:36.028 --> 20:38.906
<i>Still, that's not
what this story's about.</i>

20:38.989 --> 20:41.909
<i>It's about the day I realised
that admitting we're not heroic</i>

20:41.992 --> 20:44.578
<i>is when we're
the most heroic of all.</i>

20:58.509 --> 21:01.220
<i>I guess he'll always...</i>

21:01.303 --> 21:04.848
<i>...be a hero to me.</i>

21:24.535 --> 21:27.579
''Always be a hero to me.''

21:27.663 --> 21:29.498
What a girl!

21:29.581 --> 21:31.250
What else we got?

21:32.835 --> 21:35.212
Theatre camp.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.256
Bingo.
