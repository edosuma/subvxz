WEBVTT

00:05.591 --> 00:08.510
How come we don't have
the same number
of containers and lids?

00:08.594 --> 00:10.512
Why would they ever
get separated?

00:10.596 --> 00:14.641
Built-up resentment,
money issues, met a younger lid.

00:14.725 --> 00:16.143
Huh?
Uh-huh.

00:16.268 --> 00:19.563
Mom, where's
my science homework?
It's over there on the table.

00:19.646 --> 00:21.565
So, Alex, honey,
what's going on?

00:21.648 --> 00:23.692
- Anything exciting?
- No.

00:23.775 --> 00:25.986
- Any boys?
- No.

00:26.069 --> 00:29.489
I'm feeling a little bit disconnected
from Alex right now.

00:29.573 --> 00:32.784
Last week I picked up her cell phone,
thinking it was mine,

00:32.868 --> 00:35.245
<i>and I accidentally read</i>
<i>a few flirty text messages...</i>

00:35.329 --> 00:37.956
<i>that were probably</i>
<i>from a boy in her class, which is fine.</i>

00:38.040 --> 00:40.125
Or they're from a drifter.

00:40.209 --> 00:43.587
Come on. Isn't there something
you wanna share with your mommers?

00:43.670 --> 00:46.048
Yeah. Don't call
yourself "mommers."

00:48.967 --> 00:53.931
He blew his lid
when she tried to contain him.

00:57.226 --> 00:59.019
<i>? Hey, hey?</i>

00:59.102 --> 01:01.188
<i>? Hey, hey?</i>

01:01.271 --> 01:03.232
<i>? Hey, hey?</i>

01:03.315 --> 01:05.316
<i>? Hey, hey?</i>

01:05.400 --> 01:06.443
<i>? Hey??</i>

01:12.824 --> 01:15.577
- Okay, what do you think?
- I like it.

01:15.661 --> 01:17.746
- But you don't love it.
- No, I do. I love it.

01:17.829 --> 01:21.124
- As much as you love the other one?
- Ooh.

01:22.876 --> 01:24.253
Okay.
Hmm.

01:24.336 --> 01:25.420
The house is on fire.

01:25.504 --> 01:27.089
I only have time to grab one shirt.

01:27.172 --> 01:28.674
Which one do I take?

01:28.757 --> 01:30.509
The correct answer is:
take Lily.

01:30.592 --> 01:32.928
- After that.
- Okay, the blue one.

01:33.011 --> 01:34.638
Because the gray one
washes me out.

01:34.721 --> 01:36.223
Cam, you can't
go wrong here.

01:36.306 --> 01:37.724
Everything
you've tried on
looks great.

01:37.849 --> 01:40.727
I love you in both of them.
Oh, you're so nice to me.

01:44.481 --> 01:45.732
Hey.

01:45.816 --> 01:49.278
Mitchell has a problem with
public displays of affection.

01:49.361 --> 01:52.614
I remember once at a New Year's
Eve Party, stroke of midnight,

01:52.698 --> 01:54.658
he high-fived me.

01:54.741 --> 01:58.537
Two problems with that:
One, gays don't high-five.

01:58.620 --> 02:01.665
Two, gays don't high-five.

02:01.748 --> 02:03.709
I'm home!

02:04.793 --> 02:07.004
Mmm. What smells
so good?

02:07.087 --> 02:09.256
I'm making chunchullo,
a traditional Colombian dish,

02:09.381 --> 02:11.925
for dinner
with the family tonight.
Chunchullo.

02:12.050 --> 02:15.512
What is that,
like tacos?
Yes, like tacos.

02:15.637 --> 02:18.724
No, it isn't. It's the small
intestine of a pig.
Oh, geez.

02:18.807 --> 02:21.727
Why can't we eat
regular food
like normal people?

02:21.810 --> 02:25.314
I told you, Jay.
My grandmother- who rest in peace-

02:25.397 --> 02:27.482
has been coming to me
in my dreams,

02:27.566 --> 02:29.943
telling me that I'm
losing touch with my roots.

02:30.027 --> 02:33.989
See, this is awkward,
because my dead Uncle Joe
told me to have steak tonight.

02:34.072 --> 02:36.325
No, no, no, Jay.
Have some respect.

02:36.408 --> 02:38.577
My grandmother can hear you.

02:38.660 --> 02:40.537
What do you mean,
she can hear us?

02:40.620 --> 02:43.874
Well, in our culture, we believe
that the dead are all around us.

02:43.957 --> 02:45.667
She's right, Manny.

02:45.751 --> 02:49.338
She could be right here,
her bony fingers
reaching out from the grave.

02:50.839 --> 02:52.382
Yeah, keep it up, Jay.

02:52.466 --> 02:54.926
There's already one dead person in this room.
You wanna make it two?

02:55.010 --> 02:57.095
I'm sorry.
I've got a printer to install.

02:57.179 --> 03:00.891
Oh, Gloria. Have your
grandmother run me up
an iced tea in about 10 minutes.

03:00.974 --> 03:03.393
Yeah, she has a better chance
of making that work than you.

03:03.477 --> 03:06.813
Why don't you save us the stomping
and the swearing and call Phil?

03:06.938 --> 03:08.940
He's good at that stuff.
Better than me?

03:09.024 --> 03:11.860
Phil's not better than me
at anything,

03:11.943 --> 03:13.945
except maybe making
that stupid sound
with his mouth.

03:19.409 --> 03:21.036
? A what-what ?

03:21.119 --> 03:22.996
You spit on me.

03:23.080 --> 03:26.458
Haley, honey, I need you
to do something for me.

03:26.541 --> 03:28.418
Mom, my arm hurts.

03:28.543 --> 03:31.838
Why don't you find out what it is
before you start making up excuses
to get out of it?

03:31.922 --> 03:33.548
Okay, what is it?

03:33.632 --> 03:35.717
I need you to talk
to your sister.

03:35.801 --> 03:38.387
I think that there's
something going on
with her and a boy.

03:38.512 --> 03:41.223
So?
So? I am your mother,

03:41.306 --> 03:44.309
and it is my job to make sure
that you girls don't get
involved with a predator.

03:44.393 --> 03:47.854
Okay, Mom, stop watching <i>Dateline.</i>
And why can't you just talk to her?

03:47.938 --> 03:50.023
I have tried
to talk to her.

03:50.107 --> 03:52.442
She won't talk to me.
You know that.

03:52.526 --> 03:55.278
That's because you get
so weird every time
a boy comes near us.

03:55.362 --> 03:57.197
I just don't
want you girls to-

03:57.322 --> 04:00.409
To make the same mistakes
that you did?
No!

04:00.534 --> 04:04.413
No.
Mom, I'm not an idiot.
I pick up on things.

04:04.496 --> 04:07.249
And I don't think
that you were the good girl
you pretend you were.

04:07.374 --> 04:11.920
Wow. That is so untrue.
I was a very good girl.
Hmm.

04:12.003 --> 04:14.506
Your kids don't need to know
who you were before you had them.

04:14.589 --> 04:16.591
They need to know
who you wish you were,

04:16.675 --> 04:19.219
and they need to try
to live up to that person.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.762
They're gonna fall short.

04:20.846 --> 04:23.515
But better they fall short
of the fake you than the real you.

04:23.598 --> 04:25.100
Which is why
we don't hide anything.

04:25.183 --> 04:26.810
That is the opposite
of what I just said.

04:26.893 --> 04:28.603
I was not listening.

04:31.189 --> 04:33.567
Oh! I'll say it again.
I love you in paisley.

04:33.650 --> 04:35.652
Ooh, let me lock the door
and draw the curtains.

04:35.777 --> 04:38.530
What does that mean?
Doesn't mean anything.

04:38.613 --> 04:40.657
Good.
You know exactly
what it means.

04:40.740 --> 04:43.452
You won't kiss me in front
of other people because
you're ashamed of who you are.

04:43.535 --> 04:45.787
And yes, I went there.

04:45.871 --> 04:48.915
Okay, you can't say,
"Yes, I went there"
when you go there all the time.

04:48.999 --> 04:51.126
And by the way, I'm the one
who makes speeches on airplanes...

04:51.209 --> 04:53.170
every time someone
looks at us weird.

04:53.253 --> 04:56.673
I'm the one who gives my dad hell
when he refers to you as my "friend."

04:56.756 --> 04:58.884
That's different.
That's confrontation.

04:58.967 --> 05:01.386
- But you know what takes real strength?
- Whining?

05:01.470 --> 05:03.346
Affection.
Oh, this
is insane.

05:03.430 --> 05:05.474
Buying a shirt- it's not
a kiss-worthy moment.

05:05.557 --> 05:07.517
I didn't know there was
an official list.

05:07.642 --> 05:10.353
Tell us, what is on the list?
I'll tell you
what's not on the list.

05:10.437 --> 05:12.355
Finding
jalapeno-stuffed olives,

05:12.439 --> 05:15.025
making the light on Maple,
every time we see a VW.

05:15.108 --> 05:17.944
- You don't like kiss-buggy?
- It's not a real game.

05:18.028 --> 05:20.030
It's just another way
for you to be needy,

05:20.113 --> 05:22.157
and I don't appreciate
you making me feel bad...

05:22.240 --> 05:24.367
because I can't live up
to your impossible standards.

05:24.451 --> 05:26.411
Nobody kisses
at a bowling alley.

05:26.495 --> 05:28.872
I almost got a turkey!

05:38.423 --> 05:41.134
Yello?

05:41.218 --> 05:44.346
- Oh, hey, Jay. Just a sec. I'll go get Claire.
- Actually it's you I'm calling.

05:44.429 --> 05:46.473
- What was that?

05:46.556 --> 05:48.850
The cat. There's a cat.
What's up?

05:48.934 --> 05:50.435
<i>Well, Gloria's</i>
<i>been missing her grandmother.</i>

05:50.519 --> 05:52.687
I've been trying to get
this old picture of her printed.

05:52.771 --> 05:54.439
But I can't get this new printer to-

05:54.523 --> 05:56.024
I'll be right there.

05:56.107 --> 05:57.567
Luke, Grandpa needs us!

05:57.651 --> 05:59.528
Hells yes, I was glad to get the call.

05:59.611 --> 06:03.240
Jay's always around here fixing things,
cracking jokes about my delicate hands...

06:03.323 --> 06:06.701
or my... gag response
to the smell of paint.

06:07.619 --> 06:09.538
Look who needs me now.

06:09.621 --> 06:13.750
Mr. Hot-Dog-Fingers-Can't-Press-"Print"-
Without-Hitting-Three-Extra-Keys.

06:13.833 --> 06:17.796
Yeah. In my house now, Jay.

06:18.755 --> 06:20.715
T-- Technically, we'll be in his house,

06:20.799 --> 06:24.094
but we'll be in my area of his house.

06:25.971 --> 06:28.306
So I hear you have a boyfriend.
No, I don't.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.475
Who is he?
I'm not talking
to you about this.

06:30.559 --> 06:33.353
Oh, come on.
You're finally interesting.
Just tell me.

06:33.436 --> 06:36.523
He's not my boyfriend.
It's Jeremy Reed.

06:36.606 --> 06:38.525
He's- He's just this boy that I-

06:38.650 --> 06:40.318
Love?
No.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.487
Well, have you guys
kissed yet?
No!

06:42.612 --> 06:45.824
Well, what are you waiting for?
I'm not waiting. I'm 13.

06:45.907 --> 06:48.743
- And you've never kissed a boy?
- How old were you?

06:48.827 --> 06:51.663
Like, 1 1. And it was beautiful.

06:51.746 --> 06:55.208
I was in Jackson Kaner's
carpeted garage.

06:55.333 --> 06:56.793
Eleven?
Yeah.

06:56.876 --> 06:59.379
So you better get on it
or else he's gonna think
you're a lesbian.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.922
He's not going to think
I'm a lesbian.

07:01.006 --> 07:02.507
<i>I</i> thought you were.

07:02.591 --> 07:04.134
You totally have
the sandals for it.

07:06.344 --> 07:07.929
Let's see this bad boy.

07:08.054 --> 07:11.600
Oh! P-750. Nice unit.

07:11.683 --> 07:13.643
I would have sprung
for the 840, but I get it.

07:13.727 --> 07:15.604
Not everyone can handle
that kind of horsepower.

07:15.729 --> 07:18.648
I thought maybe
the cordless phone was interfering,
so I unplugged it.

07:18.732 --> 07:22.235
Good idea. Maybe we should
run downstairs and unplug
the toaster while we're at it.

07:22.319 --> 07:23.862
Oh, snap, Dad.

07:23.945 --> 07:25.447
A toaster.

07:25.530 --> 07:28.241
We're kidding.
Your cordless phone
is 5.8 gigahertz.

07:28.325 --> 07:30.994
This is Wi-Fi.
It's a totally
different spectrum.

07:31.077 --> 07:33.288
Walk with me.

07:33.371 --> 07:36.541
Here's a little trick that I've found
pretty useful with Claire.

07:38.001 --> 07:41.963
? The computer and the printer
must talk, talk, talk ?

07:42.047 --> 07:46.217
? Command-P makes
the picture walk, walk, walk ?

07:48.720 --> 07:51.431
How come it's not working?
It should be.

07:51.514 --> 07:52.974
Okay.

07:53.058 --> 07:56.269
Uh, that
should be printing, so-

07:56.353 --> 07:58.813
Hey, Phil. I'm gonna get
a beer, beer, beer...

07:58.897 --> 08:00.899
before I hit you
in the head, head, head.

08:06.071 --> 08:07.781
Okay.

08:07.906 --> 08:10.784
Hey. What are you doing here?
Hi, Jeremy.

08:10.867 --> 08:12.786
- I wanna ask you something.
- Sure. Ask me-

08:12.869 --> 08:14.913
Wait. Don't talk yet.
Here's the thing.

08:14.996 --> 08:17.165
We've been texting for a while,
and it's been nice.

08:17.248 --> 08:19.209
But I feel like
it's leading to something else.

08:19.292 --> 08:21.294
And I don't know
if you do or not, but-

08:21.378 --> 08:23.338
I guess what
I'm trying to say is-

08:23.421 --> 08:28.551
I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy,
asking for him to like her.

08:28.635 --> 08:31.680
Oh, God.
That's from <i>Notting Hill.</i>
So dorky.

08:31.763 --> 08:34.724
- But a really underrated movie.
- What's happening?

08:34.808 --> 08:38.102
I'm not a lesbian.
I would like for you to kiss me.

08:56.788 --> 09:00.291
Oh, I love
watching you stir.
Then I will stop.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.460
What? Are you
still mad at me?

09:02.544 --> 09:05.463
Yes. You have to apologize
for making fun of my culture,

09:05.547 --> 09:08.383
my beliefs, my chunchullo,
my <i>abuela.</i>

09:08.466 --> 09:09.843
I'm sorry.

09:09.926 --> 09:12.637
If you think your
grandmother's here with us,
I respect that.

09:12.721 --> 09:14.097
Now, come here.

09:14.180 --> 09:16.891
Oh! Grandma,
where'd you come from?

09:16.975 --> 09:19.936
We're gonna have
to get you a little bell.

09:20.019 --> 09:23.148
Enough, Jay! My culture
is very important to me.

09:23.231 --> 09:26.317
I've been working all day
to share it with your family tonight.

09:26.401 --> 09:28.695
And all you do is mock me.
Just go.

09:28.778 --> 09:31.698
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm just teasing you.

09:31.781 --> 09:33.908
Instead of being the comedian,
why don't you help me?

09:33.992 --> 09:35.368
What do you need?

09:37.746 --> 09:39.289
Slap the chicken.
Do what?

09:39.372 --> 09:42.751
In Colombia, when you cook
in honor of the departed,

09:42.834 --> 09:45.795
you have to scare death away
from the food...

09:45.879 --> 09:47.922
to protect the people
that are gonna eat it.

09:48.006 --> 09:49.591
Slap it and yell.

09:49.716 --> 09:51.176
That's the nuttiest-
Jay.

09:51.259 --> 09:54.304
Calm down.
Give me the chicken.

09:55.013 --> 09:57.015
There we go.
Mm-hmm.

09:58.850 --> 10:00.852
That's not scaring
anything away.

10:00.935 --> 10:05.190
When my grandfather used to cook,
the whole house would shake.

10:08.735 --> 10:11.529
Louder.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.532
Higher.

10:14.616 --> 10:15.992
Louder!

10:16.117 --> 10:18.661
Higher! Louder! Higher!

10:18.745 --> 10:22.081
I made all that up.
That's not a real custom in Colombia.

10:22.165 --> 10:23.625
We're not lunatics.

10:23.708 --> 10:26.586
But you mess with us
and we mess with you.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.421
That's the custom.

10:30.757 --> 10:31.883
Louder!

10:34.969 --> 10:37.806
- Hey, honey. Where'd you go?
- Nowhere. Just for a bike ride.

10:37.889 --> 10:40.141
Oh, my God.
Please tell me
this text is wrong.

10:40.225 --> 10:42.393
Did you really
just go over
to that kid's house...

10:42.477 --> 10:44.979
and try
and kiss him in front
of a million people?

10:45.063 --> 10:46.773
- Alex, did you do that?
- You got a text?

10:46.856 --> 10:48.900
Oh, yeah.
Everybody knows.

10:48.983 --> 10:52.111
- Do you know how
embarrassing this is for me?
- This is all your fault.

10:52.195 --> 10:54.906
You're the one who said
I had to kiss him or I was a lesbian.

10:54.989 --> 10:57.075
Haley, did you say that to her?

10:57.158 --> 10:58.827
Oh, don't turn this on me.
Look at her shoes.

10:58.910 --> 11:00.620
I'm never going back to school now.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.163
No, sweetheart. Yes, you are.

11:02.247 --> 11:04.165
You are going back to school.
But listen to me.

11:04.249 --> 11:06.292
Just because a boy
sends you flirty texts
doesn't mean you-

11:06.417 --> 11:08.586
What? You read my texts?
I-

11:08.670 --> 11:12.090
You read her texts?
That's why you
made me talk to her?

11:12.215 --> 11:16.219
You made her talk to me?
I kind of feel like we're
spinning out here a little bit.

11:16.302 --> 11:18.221
Look, Alex, the important
thing here is...

11:18.304 --> 11:21.266
that you have to be very careful
how you behave around boys,

11:21.349 --> 11:23.601
because it is so easy
to get a reputation.

11:23.685 --> 11:26.229
Well, I'm sorry I'm not
a perfect little good girl like you were.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.650
Were you?
Oh!

11:30.775 --> 11:32.402
Were you?

11:32.485 --> 11:34.487
I highly doubt it!

11:35.947 --> 11:39.158
Don't be such a chicken.
There's no ghost in here.

11:39.242 --> 11:42.704
I'm telling you, my mom
said her dead grandmother
was in the house.

11:42.787 --> 11:46.040
She said she felt
her here this morning,
in this room.

11:46.124 --> 11:48.418
Maybe your mom's mentally ill.

11:55.049 --> 11:59.387
Who puts a router-
in the attic?

12:01.222 --> 12:04.350
Did she have a limp...
and a cane?

12:04.434 --> 12:05.393
Uh-huh.

12:13.818 --> 12:17.405
Ghost of Manny's
great-grandma,

12:17.488 --> 12:20.033
if that's really you,

12:20.116 --> 12:21.784
show yourself!

12:26.956 --> 12:28.374
That's her!

12:35.632 --> 12:36.966
Come on!

12:38.009 --> 12:39.010
Why?

12:39.802 --> 12:41.387
Why?

12:45.475 --> 12:47.352
Hi, Grandpa.
How we doing, girls?

12:47.477 --> 12:49.687
Mom ruined my life today.
I didn't ruin
your life.

12:49.771 --> 12:52.273
Don't even talk to me.
I didn't even wanna
come here.

12:52.357 --> 12:54.275
Well, okay.

12:54.359 --> 12:56.444
Snacks and sodas
are in the living room.

12:56.527 --> 12:59.364
But don't fill up.
We've got intestines coming.

12:59.447 --> 13:03.076
Uh, Dad, if you're
looking for your shoes,
I think I know where they are.

13:03.159 --> 13:04.619
This happens to be
a Colombian custom-

13:04.702 --> 13:07.121
walking in the footsteps
of the ancestors, blah, blah, blah.

13:07.205 --> 13:08.706
Beats slapping the chicken.

13:12.377 --> 13:15.380
Here.
I brought you a drink.
Ah, wait a minute.

13:15.463 --> 13:18.800
Sip it first.
I'm not mad at you.

13:18.883 --> 13:20.802
I thought about it,
and maybe you're right.

13:20.885 --> 13:23.012
I can be a little needy sometimes.

13:23.096 --> 13:25.306
Oh, well,
I appreciate that.

13:25.390 --> 13:27.475
And you're probably
not entirely off base.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.978
I mean, Lord knows
I-I've got my quirks.

13:30.061 --> 13:33.189
And I'm not the most
demonstrative guy around.

13:33.272 --> 13:36.025
But... I'm-I'm
working on it.

13:36.150 --> 13:37.777
And I'm gonna help you with it.
Good.

13:37.902 --> 13:40.863
Just...
don't give up on me.
Never.

13:40.989 --> 13:43.491
Okay, everybody,
let's gather around.

13:43.574 --> 13:45.076
Jay, come here.

13:45.159 --> 13:48.830
Tonight we dine
on the traditional
Colombian recipes...

13:48.913 --> 13:51.290
of my <i>abuela,</i>
my grandmother.

13:51.374 --> 13:53.876
And even though
she's no longer with me,

13:53.960 --> 13:56.629
I am very happy
because I have all of you.

13:56.754 --> 14:01.092
- Oh!
- To Ana María Rosa
de la Inmaculada Jiménez Morales.

14:01.175 --> 14:05.304
To Ana María Rosa Inmaculada-

14:05.430 --> 14:08.766
Morales.
It's beautiful, Gloria,
just like my Mitchell.

14:08.850 --> 14:11.561
Oh! Oh! Whoa!

14:12.645 --> 14:14.230
Just slipped
right off there.

14:17.275 --> 14:19.402
<i>Ay,</i> Cameron, what happened?

14:19.527 --> 14:22.947
One moment you were there,
the next, only shoes.
I'll tell you what happened.

14:23.031 --> 14:25.491
Mitchell is
embarrassed to kiss me
in front of other people.

14:25.575 --> 14:28.870
- No, you ambushed me.
- Oh, Cam, come on.
Don't take it personally.

14:28.953 --> 14:31.456
When Mitchell was in high school,
he was dating this girl, Robin Schiller.

14:31.539 --> 14:35.793
- He would never kiss her either.
- That's because I was gay.

14:35.877 --> 14:37.545
What's your excuse now?

14:37.628 --> 14:41.549
<i>Ay,</i> Cameron,
it's not Mitch's fault.
He gets it from his father.

14:41.632 --> 14:44.886
Jay doesn't like
the lovey-dovey in public either.

14:44.969 --> 14:46.888
I can't believe you're
coming at me right now.

14:46.971 --> 14:48.931
I'm standing here
with shoes around my neck.

14:49.015 --> 14:50.975
And for the better part
of a half hour,

14:51.059 --> 14:52.935
I screamed the death
out of your meat.

14:53.061 --> 14:55.063
Now, what do you
want from me?
Don't you see?

14:55.146 --> 14:59.317
It's because of you that your son
cannot kiss his own lover.

14:59.442 --> 15:01.944
Don't say "lover."
We don't like "lover."

15:02.028 --> 15:03.946
Can we just eat?

15:04.030 --> 15:07.867
No. Tell Mitch that it's okay
to kiss Cam in front of you.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.869
Why is that something
we have to do?

15:09.994 --> 15:11.913
We don't.
Of course we don't.

15:11.996 --> 15:15.374
Oh, I'm sorry that I don't
wanna make out with you
in front of my whole family.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.960
No need
to apologize.
Oh! Gloria is right.

15:18.044 --> 15:20.838
Dad, you being
so emotionally closed off...

15:20.922 --> 15:24.050
makes it very difficult
for your children
to show affection.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.718
- Really?
- Yes.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.930
You had trouble showing
affection in public places?
Yes.

15:29.013 --> 15:30.765
You?
Yes.

15:30.848 --> 15:33.518
Was that before or after
you were delivered to my door
in a squad car,

15:33.601 --> 15:35.311
wearing nothing
but your underwear
and a police blanket?

15:35.394 --> 15:37.438
Oh, my God. What?

15:37.563 --> 15:39.273
You were arrested?
Awesome!

15:39.357 --> 15:41.609
Not awesome.
And I wasn't arrested.

15:41.692 --> 15:43.528
Your grandfather
is just telling a joke.

15:43.653 --> 15:45.071
It was just a joke.
Mm-hmm.

15:45.196 --> 15:46.697
I got a million of 'em.
Dad.

15:46.781 --> 15:48.282
I did it! It's printing.

15:48.366 --> 15:50.618
I had to download new firmware,
install new drivers,

15:50.701 --> 15:55.123
change your encryption
and replace an Ethernet cable
in a hundred-degree attic...

15:55.206 --> 15:57.875
while dodging particularly
aggressive spiders.

15:58.835 --> 16:01.003
But I did it.
Thanks.

16:01.087 --> 16:03.756
Oh. Okay. I guess that's it.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.759
- What? What's it?
- Wake up, dummy.

16:06.843 --> 16:08.803
This is what we're talking about.

16:08.886 --> 16:12.223
This guy's been working
like an imbecile all day for you.

16:12.306 --> 16:15.601
People need something else-
kisses, hugs.

16:15.726 --> 16:19.147
What? For fixing a printer?
Well, I was fine.
It was only four hours.

16:19.230 --> 16:21.232
I tipped over a paint can
and threw up a little.

16:21.315 --> 16:23.901
But I think-
I think "thanks" about covers it.

16:23.985 --> 16:26.779
- What's wrong with "thanks"?
- It's pretty much the bare minimum, Dad.

16:26.863 --> 16:30.408
Jay, for God sakes,
just say something.

16:30.491 --> 16:33.911
You want me to say something?
How about "you're welcome"?

16:33.995 --> 16:36.372
How about "I'm so happy
to be here for you all...

16:36.455 --> 16:38.958
so I can take the blame
for all your crap"?

16:39.041 --> 16:40.960
I can't do this.
I never did that.

16:41.043 --> 16:44.714
Trust me. I gave you twice as much
as my father ever gave me.

16:44.797 --> 16:47.216
The man kissed me one time
in my entire life.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.094
Came up behind me, kissed me
in the back of the head,
said, "Good night, Becky."

16:50.178 --> 16:51.929
He thought I was my sister.

16:52.013 --> 16:55.016
Wait a minute. When was
the last time you kissed Mitch?

16:55.099 --> 16:57.185
- Uh-
- What does that have
to do with anything?

16:57.268 --> 16:59.520
Mitch, when was
the last time he kissed you?

16:59.604 --> 17:01.731
- I- I don't remember.
- It wasn't that long ago.

17:01.814 --> 17:03.024
I was 12.

17:03.107 --> 17:05.108
Twelve?
This is the problem.

17:05.193 --> 17:09.530
Jay's dad doesn't kiss Jay,
so Jay doesn't kiss Mitch.

17:09.614 --> 17:11.115
And Mitch is uptight.

17:11.199 --> 17:13.326
Okay, okay.
Uptight was really not on the table.

17:13.409 --> 17:14.868
This is more about kissing.

17:14.952 --> 17:17.163
Jay, kiss your son.
He's a mess.

17:17.246 --> 17:20.290
- Oh, come on now.
- We don't have to do that.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.585
Yes, you do.
No.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.753
Come on. Do it.
You're in front
of your grandchildren.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.881
What kind of example
are you setting, Dad?
<i>¡Beso! ¡Beso! ¡Beso!</i>

17:26.964 --> 17:28.966
All right, all right.
Shut up!

17:31.093 --> 17:34.138
Mitch, get over here.
What? Now?
Well, I feel weird now.

17:34.222 --> 17:36.557
Don't be coy.
What are you waiting for,
a box of chocolates?

17:36.641 --> 17:38.226
Let's do this.

17:47.944 --> 17:51.280
- Aw.
- That's the
sweetest thing I've ever seen.

17:51.364 --> 17:55.326
All right, and now,
because I never wanna
hear this again,

17:55.409 --> 17:56.702
you.
Aw.

17:56.786 --> 17:59.705
Not you.
Oh, Daddy,
I love you.

18:01.165 --> 18:03.167
- Let's go eat chunchullo!

18:03.251 --> 18:04.502
That's okay.

18:04.585 --> 18:07.630
You know it's made
of pig intestines, right?

18:13.094 --> 18:15.012
Alex, wait.
What?

18:15.137 --> 18:17.598
I wanna talk to you.
Mom, I don't want another lecture.

18:17.682 --> 18:20.184
It's not a lecture.
I want to tell you something.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.479
Honey, I know exactly
how you're feeling.

18:23.604 --> 18:26.482
No, you don't.
Okay.

18:26.565 --> 18:29.986
The- The joke
that Grandpa told tonight-

18:30.069 --> 18:32.488
that- that happened.

18:32.571 --> 18:34.448
That- That was true.

18:34.573 --> 18:37.201
So you <i>were</i> arrested naked?
I wasn't naked.

18:37.285 --> 18:39.912
And I was not arrested,
per se.

18:39.996 --> 18:43.624
I <i>was</i> driven home one night
by the police...

18:43.708 --> 18:48.254
because my boyfriend
and I had gone swimming
in somebody's pool,

18:48.337 --> 18:51.257
and we didn't have
bathing suits,
and blah, blah, blah.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.009
The details
aren't important.

18:53.092 --> 18:56.637
What matters is that
everybody at school
was talking about it.

18:56.721 --> 19:00.474
And I thought I would die.
But it passed.

19:00.558 --> 19:02.310
I swear.

19:02.393 --> 19:05.521
And now, honey, I'm-
I'm glad it happened.

19:05.604 --> 19:08.065
I've got a funny story
to tell at dinner parties.

19:09.692 --> 19:12.945
So, how long did it take
before you thought it was funny?

19:13.029 --> 19:15.072
Oh, God.

19:15.156 --> 19:17.742
Ten, 15 years.

19:17.825 --> 19:20.328
Great. What do I do about tomorrow?

19:20.411 --> 19:22.413
I don't think you have
to worry about that.

19:22.496 --> 19:24.040
Look.

19:30.588 --> 19:32.923
<i>In Colombia, we kiss for everything,</i>

19:33.007 --> 19:36.052
because a kiss can mean
so many different things.

19:36.177 --> 19:39.597
There's no ghost
in here, is there?
Not a chance.

19:40.306 --> 19:41.849
Sleep easy, kid.

19:44.685 --> 19:47.271
<i>It can be the start of something new.</i>

19:53.736 --> 19:57.073
<i>It can be how we say,</i>
<i>"This is the person that I love."</i>

19:57.198 --> 20:00.743
So, who's a better kisser,
me or your dad?
Ew!

20:00.826 --> 20:02.828
<i>It can be romantic.</i>

20:02.912 --> 20:07.333
Just so you know,
if my friends weren't there,
I would have said yes.

20:08.626 --> 20:10.795
So if you still want to-

20:13.172 --> 20:17.385
If it's okay, maybe we
should hang out more first.

20:17.468 --> 20:20.429
This is only the second conversation
we've had that wasn't by text.

20:20.513 --> 20:21.722
Whoo!

20:21.806 --> 20:24.183
<i>It can also be worth waiting for.</i>

20:25.017 --> 20:27.937
Jay, what is this?

20:28.020 --> 20:31.273
Just another nice thing I did for you
while you made a fool of me.

20:31.357 --> 20:33.317
Manny let me in on your little tricks.

20:33.442 --> 20:36.654
You feel bad now?
No, I feel good.

20:40.324 --> 20:41.617
Mmm!

20:44.912 --> 20:47.164
That one is definitely my favorite.

20:50.251 --> 20:53.379
Phil, you really don't
have to do this.
No, I- I can do it.

20:53.462 --> 20:54.922
I wanna do it.

20:55.005 --> 20:58.384
It's silly to pay someone else
just to do something-

20:58.467 --> 21:01.262
Oh! Oh, no. Oh!

21:01.387 --> 21:03.639
Oh, God!
Oh, wait. No, no.
Sweetie, don't spill that.

21:03.764 --> 21:05.391
Oh, it's on me.
Careful. Oh, gosh.

21:05.516 --> 21:07.601
Oh!
Okay. Get up. You're fine.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.271
Get it off!
Okay, I got it. I got it off.

21:10.354 --> 21:12.064
Ah, the face!
Not the face.

21:12.148 --> 21:14.358
Oh, all right,
I'll pull it down.

21:14.483 --> 21:16.944
It's on me.
I'm gonna have to-
I'll cut it off.

21:17.027 --> 21:19.280
