WEBVTT

01:11.030 --> 01:12.257
What'd you think of it, Howard?

01:12.281 --> 01:13.741
Been there, done that.

01:13.824 --> 01:16.535
He's talking about the movie, Howard,
not the snack bar.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.664
It was a nice change
seeing you at night.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.749
You're not gonna
start that again, are you?

01:21.832 --> 01:24.377
It's a very common practice,
going out at night.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.795
Or so I've heard.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.398
And you know why I can't always do it.

01:27.463 --> 01:29.590
Yeah, I know. Yourjob.

01:29.674 --> 01:31.634
Hope it's worth it to you.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.513
Most of the time it is,
but not right now.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.518
See you tomorrow.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.931
Matt?

03:01.015 --> 03:02.683
Matt, where's your brother?

03:02.767 --> 03:04.101
Don't know.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.228
It doesn't look like
he slept here last night.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.607
Maybe he came in after we were asleep
and left before we woke up.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.359
He does that all the time.

03:11.442 --> 03:13.194
Except when has he ever made his bed?

03:18.574 --> 03:20.117
He's probably sick, that's all.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.911
He seemed fine last night.

03:22.161 --> 03:24.455
Yeah, but you never know
what you might wake up with.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.457
That's what I'm worried about.

03:31.796 --> 03:33.172
McGinnis?

03:33.255 --> 03:35.341
Can you hear me?

03:35.424 --> 03:37.176
McGinnis?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.194
<i>He 's not sick, Max,
I just called his house</i>

03:55.277 --> 03:57.113
<i>and he hasn't been there all day.</i>

03:57.196 --> 03:58.531
All day?

03:58.614 --> 03:59.990
Maybe Mr. Wayne had an emergency.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.409
You know how old people are.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.494
<i>- But Why wouldn't he call?</i>

04:04.412 --> 04:05.871
Dana, I gotta go. Somebody's here.

04:05.955 --> 04:07.790
<i>- If it's Terry...</i>
- Yeah, I will.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.254
Where's Terry?

04:13.337 --> 04:14.777
I haven't seen him since last night.

04:14.839 --> 04:16.048
Where was he?

04:17.091 --> 04:19.552
Down the street at the subway station.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.188
Go home.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.816
Listen, I could be very valuable to you.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.193
In fact, I've already been very valuable

04:36.277 --> 04:37.397
more times than I can count.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.738
I said go home.

04:39.822 --> 04:40.948
Make me.

05:03.596 --> 05:05.514
He could've gone anywhere.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.391
Anywhere.

05:30.498 --> 05:31.707
What happened?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.918
There was a cave-in, obviously.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.588
I remember now.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.798
I must've been out for a long time.

05:40.299 --> 05:42.718
- How am I gonna explain it to...
- To who?

05:43.052 --> 05:44.220
Never mind.

05:44.303 --> 05:46.597
What were you doin' down here, anyway?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.766
I was following somebody.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.434
Somebody I thought I recognized.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.144
He spotted me, and then...

05:52.228 --> 05:53.812
Then this happened.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.940
What are you doin' down here?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.943
Right now, I'm findin' you
the fastest way out.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.736
Got a problem with that?

06:10.746 --> 06:12.665
It's got to be him.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.972
- What did you say?
- Batman's still alive.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.055
I'm sure of it.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.951
This old shelter's made a good
hideout except for one thing.

06:49.034 --> 06:52.496
The tunnels twist so much I can
barely aim my sound blast.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.974
When I heard you screaming last night

06:53.998 --> 06:56.000
that Batman was chasing you,
all I could do

06:56.083 --> 06:58.085
was estimate his position and fire away.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.920
I thought for sure you got him.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.297
Maybe I did.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.923
Maybe this is someone else.

07:03.007 --> 07:04.258
It doesn't really matter.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.729
You want me out of here
pretty bad, don't you?

07:16.812 --> 07:19.064
This is my place, nobody tells me

07:19.148 --> 07:21.775
what to do here. No parents, no teachers

07:21.859 --> 07:24.069
and definitely not you.

07:24.153 --> 07:27.031
- Runaway, huh?
- How'd you guess?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.480
We're bottled up.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.482
No way out now.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.318
Can you hear me?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.612
I'm down in the shelters
under the subway.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.238
Can you hear me?

08:08.322 --> 08:09.740
Talkin' to yourself?

08:09.823 --> 08:10.866
It's a radio.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.660
Might as well be talkin' to yourself.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.328
Radios don't work down here.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.288
Any idiot knows that.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.627
I'll bet that one got him.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.379
Keep an eye on the scope just in case.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.346
Still here?

08:32.429 --> 08:34.306
I wanna find him just as much as you do.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.725
- Have you seen anything?
- No.

08:36.809 --> 08:38.352
Then why do I need you?

08:38.435 --> 08:39.812
Have you seen anything?

08:51.532 --> 08:52.658
That backpack.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.621
- What about it?
- It's Terry's.

09:04.253 --> 09:05.587
What are you doin'?

09:05.671 --> 09:07.047
Looking for a weak spot.

09:07.131 --> 09:08.757
Then what, genius?

09:08.841 --> 09:11.093
I got explosives, lots of 'em.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.269
What's with this condensation?

09:20.352 --> 09:22.646
Must be something cold
on the other side.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.481
Ever hear of the Gotham River?

09:24.565 --> 09:26.316
Runs all around here underground.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.194
If you break through,
we'll be dead real quick

09:29.278 --> 09:31.071
instead of real slow,

09:31.155 --> 09:32.823
which is what's gonna happen now.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.206
- Look at that guy.
- Yeah, nice vest, buddy.

09:52.301 --> 09:53.594
Anything good on tonight?

09:55.554 --> 09:57.556
Stay here.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.898
What do you want?

10:05.981 --> 10:07.357
A backpack.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.318
This look like a store to you?

10:09.401 --> 10:10.861
I'll pay a fair price.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.821
A very fair price.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.075
Anybody got a backpack they wanna sell?

10:17.159 --> 10:19.411
- Who wants to know?
- Some old guy.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.043
You were in the subway, weren't you?

10:26.126 --> 10:29.171
Yes. That's where I saw your backpack.

10:29.254 --> 10:32.633
And you followed me all the way here
because you just had to have it?

10:32.716 --> 10:34.718
Something like that.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.888
You really want it, don't you?

10:37.971 --> 10:41.141
How about ten. No, 20 credits.

10:41.225 --> 10:44.269
Deal, but I wanna know where you got it.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.563
How about for 30?

10:51.610 --> 10:53.987
Now, tell me why you
really want this old thing.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.326
Back at school,
half the kids wanna be you.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.495
- Yeah?
- I was in the other half.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.248
Who do you wanna be?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.834
Maybe Blight or Spellbinder.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.169
Or somebody in the Royal Flush Gang.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.754
Are you serious?

11:10.838 --> 11:12.172
Hey, they did what they wanted

11:12.256 --> 11:14.258
and wouldn't let
anyone tell 'em what to do.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.051
But look how they ended up.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.928
Yeah, thanks to you,
and I'm gonna end up

11:18.011 --> 11:20.514
that way too now, thanks to you.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.227
Do that again, same spot.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.607
It sounds different here,

11:30.691 --> 11:32.401
and there's no condensation.

11:37.406 --> 11:39.867
- What are you doin'?
- My explosives.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.160
You sure this is gonna work?

11:42.244 --> 11:44.288
I mean, if you use too much,
you could blow up.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.811
You think Blight would have worried
about something like that?

11:55.424 --> 11:57.593
I don't even know your name.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.636
- It's Dak.
- Dak?

11:59.720 --> 12:01.221
Sounds like a throat lozenge.

12:02.514 --> 12:06.310
It's short for Darius Arthur Kellman.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.187
Darius Arthur Kellman.
Well, that explains it.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.526
Just get behind me, okay?

12:14.610 --> 12:16.570
I'm not afraid.

12:16.653 --> 12:17.654
Hey!

12:29.082 --> 12:31.919
No, that's what I heard,
one of the support beams.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.378
Must be hollow.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.184
Dak, we got through.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.606
Use some more of your explosives.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.025
I would, if I had any left.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.280
You could make it through there,

13:00.364 --> 13:02.783
and you know how to
find your way around here.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.993
You trust me to get help for you?

13:05.077 --> 13:06.578
After everything I've said?

13:06.662 --> 13:08.664
Better one of us
gets out than neither of us.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.408
Come on, old man.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.368
Why do you want that backpack so bad?

13:50.872 --> 13:52.958
You guys can't be the T's.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.211
I always heard
the T's knew how to party.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.963
We're the T's, all right.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.340
Nobody parties heartier than us, babe.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.718
Slappin' around some old man.
You call that partying?

14:02.801 --> 14:05.595
- You got a better idea?
- I might.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.180
Why don't you both close your eyes?

14:07.264 --> 14:10.559
Sorry. We like to watch.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.962
Then don't say I didn't warn you.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.354
Mace!

14:14.438 --> 14:16.064
Water! Water!

14:35.375 --> 14:37.711
Now are you gonna tell me
where you got that backpack?

14:37.794 --> 14:39.546
I'm never gonna tell you nothin'.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.630
Never.

14:42.174 --> 14:44.342
Would you step out for a moment, please?

14:54.019 --> 14:55.187
He found it this morning,

14:55.270 --> 14:58.148
down in the old shelter
below the subway station.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.691
He didn't see anyone near it.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.359
You sure he's telling the truth?

15:01.443 --> 15:02.486
Yes.

15:07.491 --> 15:08.658
<i>Batman.</i>

15:08.742 --> 15:10.368
<i>I know you're down here somewhere.</i>

15:10.452 --> 15:12.662
<i>This is your old pal Shriek.</i>

15:12.746 --> 15:14.346
<i>I've got your little friend with me here</i>

15:14.372 --> 15:16.041
<i>in the main shelter,
and I want you to...</i>

15:16.124 --> 15:18.627
<i>Well, you know the rest, don't you?</i>

15:19.753 --> 15:21.463
Better hurry, Batman.

15:22.047 --> 15:24.633
- Better hurry.
- Idiot.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.760
Nobody sacrifices their life

15:26.843 --> 15:29.012
for somebody else, not in this world.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.807
- You don't know Batman.
- I know people.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.809
Perhaps you'd like to bet on it.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.977
- Your life, say?
- Too easy.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.855
Even if he wanted to
give himself up to you, he couldn't.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.024
- And why's that?
- He's trapped in...

15:43.068 --> 15:45.362
You know right where he is, don't you?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.781
Tell me. Tell me!

15:47.864 --> 15:50.242
Maybe I don't owe Batman anything,

15:50.325 --> 15:52.077
but I sure don't owe you
anything, either.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.537
Wrong.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.330
You're about to owe me your life

15:55.413 --> 15:57.582
but only if you take me to him.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.671
You're not coming.
I won't let you.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.297
Aren't you forgetting something?

16:04.381 --> 16:06.675
I saved you tonight,
not the other way around.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.261
You're good, better than I thought.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.512
But this isn't about you.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.472
What, then?

16:12.556 --> 16:15.475
I don't know whether
Terry's dead or alive

16:15.559 --> 16:17.227
and that's enough for my conscience.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.187
Mr. Wayne, with all due respect,

16:19.271 --> 16:21.189
your conscience don't mean diddly to me,

16:21.273 --> 16:22.833
so I'm just gonna go right ahead and...

16:26.653 --> 16:29.072
There's no way into the shelter now.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.031
Unless...

16:30.115 --> 16:31.116
Unless what?

16:31.575 --> 16:33.702
Unless I distract them for you.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.037
You mean now you want me to...

16:36.121 --> 16:37.873
Yes, but be careful.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.295
Workin' late, fellas?

16:43.378 --> 16:45.218
Our seismograph
picked up something down there.

16:45.297 --> 16:46.339
Maybe a cave-in.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.300
Ooh, a cave-in.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.552
- Sounds dangerous.
- Might be.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.346
Speaking of dangerous,
should that young lady

16:53.430 --> 16:54.556
be down there?

16:55.765 --> 16:57.225
- Hey, you!
- Get outta there!

16:59.728 --> 17:01.354
- Hey, somebody
- Hey, come back here!

17:01.438 --> 17:02.647
That old man told me to do it!

17:02.731 --> 17:04.274
You should arrest him, too.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.609
He's right over there...

17:16.995 --> 17:18.622
There. He's right behind that wall.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.956
How could you possibly...

17:20.040 --> 17:21.958
I know these tunnels
like the back of my hand.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.546
Help! Help!

18:13.510 --> 18:15.011
Help!

18:15.095 --> 18:17.347
Help!

18:52.424 --> 18:54.009
All for nothing.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.511
All that effort wasted.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.514
But at least it allows me the pleasure
of dispatching you myself.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.392
Why do they always talk so much?

19:06.855 --> 19:09.524
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.126
Where's he going?

19:28.209 --> 19:29.437
Told me he was headed for home.

19:29.461 --> 19:30.462
Good.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.341
Said he'd find me and kill me
if I ever told anyone he cried.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.345
Does Max have any idea what happened?

19:38.470 --> 19:41.139
As a matter of fact, I spent
most of the evening with her.

19:41.473 --> 19:42.891
Really, then the two of you

19:42.974 --> 19:44.577
must have finally
come to an understanding.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.061
You could say that.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.021
You can't do this to me!

19:48.104 --> 19:50.440
It's not fair! I'II sue!

20:02.869 --> 20:05.580
Well, now it all makes sense.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.415
You've started making your bed.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.793
Uh, yeah. Anything to help you out, Mom.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.796
And here I was, thinking
you weren't coming home at night.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.214
Who, me?

20:16.341 --> 20:19.177
Go eat your breakfast.
You don't wanna be late for school.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.804
Right. Sure.
