WEBVTT

00:08.208 --> 00:10.208
[theme music playing]

00:36.625 --> 00:39.750
[man on radio] ...is closed permanently.
We've known that for some time now.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.541
[seagulls squawking]

00:44.750 --> 00:47.208
[man narrating] There had been
a big storm the night before.

00:47.291 --> 00:50.416
And so, it was late morning
before the town heard the first news

00:50.500 --> 00:54.125
of the arrival after it had been spotted
by local fishermen.

00:54.208 --> 00:55.208
[indistinct chatter]

00:55.291 --> 00:58.916
Being scientists, my colleagues and I,
of course, discounted the first reports

00:59.000 --> 01:01.791
as exaggerations or a trick of the light.

01:02.750 --> 01:06.333
But as ever more eyewitnesses
returned from the beach,

01:06.416 --> 01:09.125
we finally decided to investigate
for ourselves.

01:09.958 --> 01:12.791
Come on, then, Steven.
No time to waste gawking.

01:13.708 --> 01:15.166
Right behind you.

01:15.250 --> 01:16.666
[indistinct chatter]

01:16.750 --> 01:19.416
[man] He must displace at least 60 tons.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.291
[woman] I'd say closer to 80.
The bones alone must weigh 30 tons.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.625
[Steven]
The vast proportions of his features

01:26.708 --> 01:29.666
made it impossible to assess
the age of the giant,

01:29.750 --> 01:32.250
but his classically modeled mouth and nose

01:32.333 --> 01:36.458
suggest he had been a young man
of discreet and modest temper.

01:39.375 --> 01:41.375
[waves crashing]

01:42.500 --> 01:46.000
It was a noble face,
possessed of an ornate charm

01:46.083 --> 01:49.458
that belied
the brutish power of the giant's physique.

01:54.541 --> 01:57.125
His magnificent Homeric stature

01:57.208 --> 02:00.416
offered a more authentic example
of a drownedArgonaut

02:00.500 --> 02:02.500
or a hero from The Odyssey

02:02.583 --> 02:06.833
than the conventional human-sized
portraitspreviously in my mind.

02:17.833 --> 02:22.791
What I found so fascinating
was partly his immense scale, of course,

02:22.875 --> 02:27.875
but above all, it was simply
the categorical fact of his existence.

02:27.958 --> 02:31.208
Whatever else in our lives
might be open to doubt,

02:31.291 --> 02:35.458
this giant existed in an absolute sense...

02:36.333 --> 02:39.750
providing us a glimpse
into a world of similar absolutes

02:39.833 --> 02:45.500
in which we spectators on the beach
were such imperfect and puny copies.

02:47.833 --> 02:49.208
Say, look over there.

02:50.916 --> 02:52.750
[cheering]

02:54.916 --> 02:56.458
Who is that? Come on.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.541
[woman 1] Oh, it's rubbery.

03:31.375 --> 03:33.500
-[woman 2] How is it up there?
-[laughing]

03:35.958 --> 03:37.458
[woman 2] Is it funny?

03:38.833 --> 03:41.000
Teddy, you bastard, I nearly fell.

03:41.083 --> 03:42.875
You looked so scared.

03:45.083 --> 03:48.166
From a distance,
it looked as if he was merely asleep

03:48.250 --> 03:51.583
and could, at any moment,
clap his heels together

03:51.666 --> 03:56.500
and crush the miniscule replicas
of himself that swarmed around him.

04:03.958 --> 04:05.541
But as time passed,

04:05.625 --> 04:09.708
the magical spell
cast by the giant began to dissipate.

04:11.291 --> 04:13.958
We'd best get back to town.
It'll be dark soon.

04:14.041 --> 04:16.416
Yeah. I suppose you're right.

04:19.166 --> 04:21.166
[crowd cheering]

04:24.416 --> 04:27.833
Three days passed
before my next visit to the beach.

04:33.041 --> 04:35.625
Sensing a particular interest
in the giant,

04:35.708 --> 04:38.375
my associates at the institute
delegated the task

04:38.458 --> 04:40.833
of keeping
the giant under observation to me.

04:41.750 --> 04:45.291
There was nothing morbid
about this because, for all intents,

04:45.375 --> 04:47.708
the giant was still alive for me.

04:49.083 --> 04:52.708
Indeed, more alive
than many of the people around me.

04:53.583 --> 04:54.750
[barks]

04:54.833 --> 04:56.250
[laughing]

04:57.750 --> 04:59.208
[screams]

05:00.958 --> 05:02.958
[worker 1]
No, it's not. This bastard's big.

05:03.625 --> 05:07.666
If the butchers start here,
we can soon get access to the thigh bone.

05:08.291 --> 05:10.375
And we can work our way up to the hip.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.583
[worker 2] Going to be some overtime,
getting this done.

05:15.458 --> 05:16.916
[Steven] The following day,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
I deliberately postponed my visit
until late afternoon,

05:20.083 --> 05:23.000
hoping that I'd find
fewer people on the beach.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.500
Prolonged immersion in seawater
and the tumefaction of his tissues

05:35.583 --> 05:38.291
had given the face a less youthful look.

05:38.375 --> 05:42.416
His features now had
an appearance of well-fed maturity,

05:42.500 --> 05:45.041
hinting at the growing corruption to come.

05:46.541 --> 05:47.541
[seagulls squawking]

05:47.625 --> 05:52.333
This was the beginning of his surrender
to that all-demanding system of time,

05:52.416 --> 05:55.500
in which
the rest of humanity found itself.

05:56.833 --> 05:59.291
However repellent it may seem,

05:59.375 --> 06:04.458
this ceaseless metamorphosis,
this visible life-in-death,

06:04.541 --> 06:08.250
is what gave me the courage
to finally set foot on his corpse.

06:12.125 --> 06:14.125
[dramatic music playing]

06:39.958 --> 06:45.583
This new perspective made me more aware
of the last physical agonies of the giant.

06:45.666 --> 06:49.500
No less painful
for his unawareness of them.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.958
In the end, his face had been transformed

07:00.041 --> 07:03.166
into a mask of exhaustion
and helplessness.

07:05.875 --> 07:08.416
Caught in that same twisting whirlpool

07:08.500 --> 07:11.541
for which
all our finite lives are destined.

07:14.708 --> 07:18.666
And his suffering was made
all the more tragic by the isolation

07:18.750 --> 07:20.458
in which he endured it.

07:20.541 --> 07:24.416
Cast like an abandoned ship
upon the empty shore.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.958
The amputation was but the first
of a series of depredations.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.791
Two days had passed,

07:36.875 --> 07:39.166
while I struggled to overcome
my reluctance

07:39.250 --> 07:42.250
to witness the end
of this magnificent illusion.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.416
Despite his immense size,

07:50.500 --> 07:55.458
these insults to the giant's body
made him appear more human to me.

07:55.958 --> 07:57.166
More vulnerable.

07:58.208 --> 08:02.416
But that weakness has released
a sudden flood of repressed spite,

08:02.500 --> 08:07.375
encouraging the mutilation of the colossus
by the tiny creatures around it.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.583
When I visited the beach
the following day,

08:14.666 --> 08:19.333
I found, almost with relief,
that the head had been removed.

08:27.458 --> 08:30.833
Some weeks had lapsed
before my next journey to the beach.

08:30.916 --> 08:35.000
And by then, any human likeness
held by the giant had vanished.

08:35.791 --> 08:37.083
Evening, mate.

08:43.583 --> 08:47.500
And with the loss of those
few remaining traces of personality

08:47.583 --> 08:50.125
that had clung tenuously to the figure,

08:50.208 --> 08:54.416
the interest of the spectators had,
at last, expired.

09:08.333 --> 09:12.708
Months later, after the giant's arrival
had been generally forgotten,

09:12.791 --> 09:17.625
various pieces of the body
began to reappear around town.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.208
Most of those remains were bones.

09:28.541 --> 09:33.875
These mighty yet disembodied fragments
seem to better convey the essence

09:33.958 --> 09:35.583
of the giant's magnificence

09:35.666 --> 09:38.916
than my last memories
of his bloated appendages.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.958
[engine revs]

09:41.041 --> 09:42.708
[dramatic music playing]

09:42.791 --> 09:46.041
I have no doubt
that if I search the town's pubs,

09:46.125 --> 09:51.500
hotels, and eateries, I'd also find
the mummified nose or ears of the giant

09:51.583 --> 09:54.250
hanging on walls and fireplaces.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.250
[male attendant] Tickets, get them here!

09:57.333 --> 10:00.958
Oi! Get out of here.
You wanna look, you pay for it.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.625
As for the immense pizzle,

10:03.708 --> 10:07.291
this ends its days
in the freak museum of a small circus,

10:07.375 --> 10:10.208
which travels up and down
the northwest coast.

10:11.083 --> 10:13.416
That monumental apparatus,

10:13.500 --> 10:16.791
stunning in its proportions
and once potency,

10:16.875 --> 10:19.875
occupies a complete tent to itself,

10:19.958 --> 10:23.708
though, sadly,
it is mislabeled as belonging to a whale.

10:28.666 --> 10:33.125
Even those who came and saw the giant
after the storm now remember him,

10:33.208 --> 10:36.625
if at all, as merely a large sea beast.

10:38.041 --> 10:40.625
But the giant is still alive for me.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.750
I often dream of his resurrection.

10:44.250 --> 10:47.625
A colossus
striding through the streets of town,

10:47.708 --> 10:52.625
picking up the fragments of himself
on his return journey to the sea.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.041
[dramatic music playing]
