01:17.160 --> 01:18.605
Can I go?

01:50.080 --> 01:53.209
- Right on schedule.
- What about Mr Brinway?

01:53.400 --> 01:56.244
Maybe we should really pee
just to make it look good.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.649
He's busy singing. Besides,
he doesn't even know we're gone.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.969
You just let all the Stinkers
leave at the same time!

02:03.160 --> 02:06.607
- I hate it when you call them Stinkers.
- That's what they are!

02:06.800 --> 02:08.801
<i>We sail the ocean blue...</i>

02:09.000 --> 02:12.527
There's no way they all had to
relieve themselves at the same time.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.087
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.850
Spencer, Max.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.008
Got a little job for you.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.286
Oh, God! Oh, God!
If Roy catches us in here, we're dead.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.529
And we're stealing his tools.
He'll kill us twice.

02:30.720 --> 02:35.328
Witz, we're on a tight schedule.
Are you in or are you out?

02:35.520 --> 02:38.000
Well, I'm...in. Definitely in.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.363
Good.
'Cause you're gonna be our test pilot.

02:41.560 --> 02:42.846
I'm out! I'm out!

02:43.040 --> 02:46.886
- All right, Witz, you're the man!
- The man's out. I'm out.

02:47.080 --> 02:50.721
Domino, quit that,
I'm getting a headache. Ow! Ow!

02:55.920 --> 02:59.003
- Mr Brinway, we saw them.
- Not now, this is my number!

03:01.480 --> 03:03.687
- The Stinkers are up to something.
- What?

03:07.880 --> 03:12.522
- They stole Roy's leaf blower.
- What are they doing with that?

03:16.480 --> 03:19.211
- Will you sit still?
- Sorry.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.722
I'm about to go where no kid
has ever gone before.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.083
Make sure his helmet's on tight.
He could land on his head.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.851
My head? Sonny, why me?

03:29.040 --> 03:32.840
You should be happy. You'll be
the first kid to fly in a desk chair.

03:33.040 --> 03:36.089
Did you say "die in a desk chair"?

03:36.280 --> 03:37.850
Finished.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.249
- What did you do that for?
- "S" is for Stinkers.

03:41.440 --> 03:45.047
Mr Brinway calls us that. Why not
let him know we're coming?

03:45.240 --> 03:46.969
Ready for take-off.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.164
If something goes wrong,
hit the eject button.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.931
I rigged the chair with a parachute.

03:53.120 --> 03:57.091
- Parachute? I'm outta here!
- Just close your eyes. It'll be fun.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.203
Everybody, stand clear!

03:59.400 --> 04:04.930
Boy, this is just like <i>Apollo 13.</i>
Me and my pops saw it six times.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.964
Five, four, three,

04:08.160 --> 04:11.164
- two, one.
- Tell my mother I loved her.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.241
Houston, we got a problem.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.406
Loaf, how do we stop it?

04:31.600 --> 04:33.762
Catch it and turn off the leaf blower.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.329
What's it doing?

04:51.480 --> 04:55.201
This isn't so bad.
I feel like I'm still on the ground.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.569
Witz, run like <i>The Fugitive!</i>

05:02.640 --> 05:05.166
- Hi, Roy.
- Hey, what up?

05:14.840 --> 05:17.491
I knew you weren't peeing!

05:17.680 --> 05:19.205
Halt!

05:19.400 --> 05:23.166
Sorry, Mr Brinway.
Is it too late to go now?

05:23.360 --> 05:27.081
- Get inside this minute!
- Yes, sir, Mr Brinway.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.569
Wow!

05:32.760 --> 05:34.842
It shaved his butt.

05:45.480 --> 05:48.324
Hit the deck, Mr Brinway.

05:48.520 --> 05:52.491
Look at that. Mr Brinway runs
just like Scooby-Doo.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.608
Hop on, Mr Brinway.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.724
- Hop on!
- What is that thing?

05:58.920 --> 06:02.208
I don't know, but it's headed
for your new Jag.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.051
- No! Not the XJS!
- Don't worry.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.810
No! No!

06:37.400 --> 06:40.449
Please, take me.
Don't take the Jag.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.842
- Thank you, thank you.
- You can get out now, Mr Brinway.

06:56.960 --> 07:00.089
Oh...the edger's still on.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.683
It's off now, you can come out now,
Mr Brinway.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.364
Sneaking out of opera appreciation,

07:12.560 --> 07:16.963
stealing a leaf blower,
ruining my favourite seersucker suit,

07:17.160 --> 07:22.166
causing several thousand dollars of
car-body damage, and more important,

07:22.360 --> 07:26.410
disrupting the entire summer
enrichment programme here.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.649
Your actions are an egregious assault
on the Dartmoor name.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.242
You leave me no choice.
You're all expelled!

07:34.280 --> 07:38.922
Mr Brinway, may I speak to you
for a moment, please?

07:41.760 --> 07:45.845
- Sonny, what are we gonna do?
- He's just trying to scare us.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.647
He's doing a great job of it.
I just wet my pants.

07:49.840 --> 07:52.764
- I...
- Don't waste your breath, Harriet.

07:52.960 --> 07:57.170
- Once I make up my mind.
- It's like a well-made hospital bed.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.523
Once it's made up,
you can bounce a krone off it.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.645
- The board of trustees' meeting...
- What about it?

08:04.840 --> 08:08.481
Sonny and Lucy and Allen
are all on scholarship.

08:08.680 --> 08:13.083
I don't think the board would like it
if you threw them out on the street.

08:13.280 --> 08:18.127
What if the press were to get
hold of it? It could get really ugly.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.402
The board would fire you.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.251
People would point and laugh at you.

08:23.440 --> 08:28.651
Some may even throw rocks.
You'd have to move to another town...

08:28.840 --> 08:30.205
OK, OK.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.168
I get the picture.

08:42.200 --> 08:46.205
Children, perhaps
I was being a little bit hasty.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.722
I'm very disappointed in you.

08:49.920 --> 08:54.482
But I'm willing
to give you all one more chance.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.881
As of now, you're on double probation.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.722
If any of you steps out of line,
just once, you're all history!

09:04.920 --> 09:06.445
Roy!

09:06.640 --> 09:09.769
I found your desk chair
under the bougainvillea.

09:09.960 --> 09:13.681
- It must've rolled out of your office.
- Rolled out?

09:13.880 --> 09:17.851
Probably had too much oil
on the wheels. Happens all the time.

09:18.040 --> 09:22.648
- Happens all the time, my foot!
- Did you disconnect the ejection seat?

09:22.840 --> 09:24.729
Of course I did.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.046
I guess I didn't.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.124
Ouch!

09:46.640 --> 09:51.282
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine, if I don't move my head.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.003
Attention, Dartmoor children!

09:56.200 --> 10:00.649
Remember, the enriching aquarium
field trip is tomorrow afternoon.

10:00.840 --> 10:05.641
Return your signed parental consent
forms, or you're not going!

10:05.840 --> 10:08.491
There'll be no exceptions!

10:22.520 --> 10:26.411
Sure is exciting about the field trip
tomorrow, isn't it?

10:26.600 --> 10:28.682
Although I am allergic to shellfish.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.680
I get hives and ugly rashes.
Sometimes I can't even breathe.

10:32.880 --> 10:38.171
- How's it feel on probation, loser?
- I'm not a loser, I'm a test pilot!

10:38.360 --> 10:40.840
All you Stinkers are losers, farthead.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.601
Yeah, farthead. You shouldn't be
here at Dartmoor.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.121
You should be in the cemetery.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.529
You're right.
I think I'll go dig myself a hole.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.801
What a cheap, dorky backpack.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.848
Oops. I guess it wasn't closed.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.603
Look at this!

11:07.800 --> 11:11.771
- Pick it up.
- Why don't you make him?

11:11.960 --> 11:14.645
How about we kick your butt so high

11:14.840 --> 11:17.650
you'll be wiping your face
when you go to the toilet?

11:17.840 --> 11:21.606
Yeah, Stinkers rule,
others drool, fool!

11:22.520 --> 11:27.208
Hey, isn't that Mr Brinway over there?

11:27.400 --> 11:28.970
Hi, Mr Brinway!

11:29.160 --> 11:32.403
Hit me and you'll break probation,
butt-brains.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.284
Yeah, butt-brains.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.203
Hey, my backpack!
I'm gonna kill you!

11:38.400 --> 11:41.768
- I'm gonna kill you!
- I wonder how that happened.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.205
Oh, wow.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.721
Harriet, look. Ouch!

11:51.920 --> 11:55.163
It's Spencer Dane Senior
picking up Spencer Dane Junior.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.601
I must have that man on my board.

11:57.800 --> 12:02.488
That way, I can convince him to
donate for the Shakespeare festival.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.805
Mr Dane!

12:09.160 --> 12:10.764
Mr Dane.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.405
Mr Dane.

12:13.840 --> 12:18.050
We'll talk later. You look great!

12:24.080 --> 12:28.369
Roy, get rid of that disgusting
beverage and drive with two hands.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.040
Consider it gone.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.805
Everybody's a critic.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.928
- Loaf, heave it back at him.
- No, that's just what they want.

13:12.120 --> 13:16.091
Yeah, they'll tell Mr Brinway
and we'll all get expelled.

13:16.280 --> 13:19.887
We just can't sit here and take this.
We gotta do something.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.526
How about we beat the crap out of 'em?

13:22.720 --> 13:25.405
Sonny, tell her no!

13:37.920 --> 13:40.969
Does anybody else
feel like throwing up?

13:41.160 --> 13:45.006
- Don't blow chunks on me.
- I got an idea.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.248
What are you doing here?

13:49.440 --> 13:52.011
Sorry, I get bus-sick.

13:58.480 --> 14:02.610
<i>The Springville Aquarium proudly
presents Mysteries of the Oceans.</i>

14:02.800 --> 14:05.087
Somebody had carrots.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.842
They still stink.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.162
You're absolutely right.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.967
By the way, Spencer, have you asked
your father about joining the board?

14:23.160 --> 14:26.687
- I forgot.
- Of course you did. I understand.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.167
You're a busy little man.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.048
You got the money?

14:35.560 --> 14:38.131
You got the merchandise?

14:38.320 --> 14:41.290
Meet out back in the holding area
in 20 minutes.

14:51.560 --> 14:55.770
Octopus? Hey, no way.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.008
Here, pus, pus, pus!

14:58.200 --> 15:02.603
Here, pus, pus, pus. Come here.
Hey, come here, come here.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.928
Come play with Uncle Roy.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.722
OK, I want my keys back.
Hey, I'm not kidding. I'm serious.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.445
No! No!

15:21.640 --> 15:26.680
Excuse me, ma'am, but where
do you keep your killer whales?

15:26.880 --> 15:29.645
Sorry, dear,
we don't have any killer whales.

15:29.840 --> 15:33.128
Oh, that's too bad. Let's go back.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.051
What's the most awesomest thing
you've got?

15:36.240 --> 15:38.720
The most awesomest thing we got?

15:38.920 --> 15:41.730
Well...there's Slappy.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.282
- Sure ain't no killer whale.
- Look how bummed out he is.

15:51.480 --> 15:55.724
- He doesn't look bummed out to me.
- You don't understand sea lions.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.321
They're a very complicated mammal.

15:58.520 --> 16:01.171
He could die in there.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.842
Yeah, right!
He can fart himself to death.

16:05.040 --> 16:08.601
Poor thing. Looks like he's in prison.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.045
The ocean's his home. He belongs there.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.528
Yeah. You're right. We gotta free him!

16:15.720 --> 16:19.042
Free him? We don't even know him!

16:19.240 --> 16:22.801
<i>Free Willy.</i> "Free Slappy". I like it.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.241
How do we get him out of there?

16:25.440 --> 16:28.091
Well, if one kid can free a whale,

16:28.280 --> 16:31.727
five should definitely
be able to free a fat sea lion.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.843
All right, let's review.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.088
Close relatives of the sea urchin,

16:37.280 --> 16:40.124
the sand dollar,
<i>Dendraster excentricus</i>

16:40.320 --> 16:44.530
burrows its anterior end
in the sand with its oral end

16:44.720 --> 16:47.929
the flat side parallel
with the water currents.

16:48.120 --> 16:51.567
- Mr Brinway?
- What is it? Oh, it's you.

16:51.760 --> 16:55.287
- Spencer, what's wrong, son?
- The Stinkers are gone.

16:55.480 --> 16:59.007
We thought you'd want
to find them and expel them.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.407
Excellent job, boys.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.766
If we had a giant crane
with a magnet on the end

17:06.960 --> 17:10.281
and we put a metal collar
around Slappy's neck

17:10.480 --> 17:13.165
then we could hoist him
right out of here.

17:13.359 --> 17:17.330
- I got a magnet at home.
- You got a crane at home?

17:17.520 --> 17:19.443
OK, bad idea.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.085
I got it!

17:21.280 --> 17:25.046
Let's get some scuba gear and
swim through the sewers to the tank?

17:25.240 --> 17:27.208
Uh-huh. No swimming in sewers.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.483
There's alligators
and God knows what else.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.921
OK, the sewer's out.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.763
Hey, that man's taking Slappy
somewhere.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.850
Uh-oh, here comes Mr Brinway.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.042
- He looks pissed.
- Stinkers, freeze!

17:44.240 --> 17:46.402
- What do we do?
- I say we freeze.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.841
No, we run.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.724
No!

17:52.320 --> 17:55.130
Stinkers! Excuse me.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.607
- Get out of the way!
- Stinkers?

18:08.360 --> 18:09.850
Witzowitz!

18:10.720 --> 18:13.166
I've got you, you little Stinker!

18:13.360 --> 18:16.250
- Who are you calling a little stinker?
- My mistake.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.125
You bet it is. Give me that, son.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.848
Go!

19:05.040 --> 19:06.769
- Hi, Roy.
- Hey, Loaf.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.845
Help me!

19:26.960 --> 19:29.611
Somebody help me!

19:31.640 --> 19:34.769
I think we lost him.

19:34.960 --> 19:38.089
I hope I'm too young
to have a heart attack.

19:40.560 --> 19:45.566
- Hey, look, it's Slappy.
- And they got him in a cage.

19:45.760 --> 19:50.721
- Poor little baby.
- That looks like a baby to you?

19:50.920 --> 19:56.768
- You want to go home to the ocean?
- It's fate. We were meant to free him.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.122
This is a big mistake.

20:02.760 --> 20:06.731
- Forget it, I almost got caught.
- I gotta have that sea lion.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.809
Get him yourself. I'm out.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.209
That's the last time I do business
with a punk kid like you!

20:14.240 --> 20:16.129
Hey!

20:21.040 --> 20:23.202
- What happened?
- I don't know.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.562
- The door opened.
- He ran out.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.331
I think it's locked from the outside.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.042
Lucky thing I'm not paying
by the pound.

20:35.760 --> 20:39.048
You're gonna pay for that, fatso.

20:41.920 --> 20:45.288
- Just give me my money.
- Wait. I got to pull the van around.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.006
- You're on your own.
- Thanks for nothing.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.568
You're going nowhere, lard-butt.
I'll be right back.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.684
There he is! We've found him.
Isn't that great?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.326
"Great" isn't the word for it.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.251
How did you get into another cage?

21:01.440 --> 21:04.569
Don't worry, Slap,
we'll get you out of there.

21:22.720 --> 21:25.291
Where's my flabby fish?

21:35.440 --> 21:38.205
If you feed him, he will come.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.368
Guys, isn't somebody gonna notice

21:40.560 --> 21:44.849
a big fat smelly sea lion on the bus
that wasn't there before?

21:45.040 --> 21:48.522
Witz, you insulted him. Apologise.

21:48.720 --> 21:53.169
Sorry, Slappy. You really are
a very good-looking sea lion.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.967
We have to disguise him.
He has to look like one of us.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.131
You can't park here, it's a red zone.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.687
- Shove your red zone.
- <i>Move your van!</i>

22:13.880 --> 22:17.885
Sorry, officer, you said red zone?
I'll pull out immediately.

22:31.080 --> 22:34.163
That's it.
The Stinkers are all expelled.

22:34.360 --> 22:37.170
I told you, Allen Witzowitz was sick.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.931
They were taking him back to the bus.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.930
- Why didn't they stop when I yelled?
- They didn't hear you.

22:43.120 --> 22:47.489
- You believe this?
- No. They got bored.

22:47.680 --> 22:52.527
We all got bored. It's a field trip,
we're supposed to have fun.

22:52.720 --> 22:57.965
Not listen to you go on and on
about the E-C-H...whatever.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.446
OK, OK, OK.

23:00.720 --> 23:04.520
- Roy, I'm freezing. Close that window!
- Leave it open, Roy.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.451
It's stuffy and someone smells rank.

23:07.640 --> 23:11.964
Well, excuse me, Miss Renuzit.
I was wrestling with an octopus!

23:12.160 --> 23:15.801
Boy, one of you really reeks!

23:23.280 --> 23:26.489
Can I get up now?
My face is in his butt.

23:26.680 --> 23:30.002
No. Keep it there. Don't move.

23:38.200 --> 23:44.367
- Come on, Slappy. Jump!
- I don't think he wants to jump.

23:44.560 --> 23:48.531
If we had time, I could build a block
and tackle and swing him down.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.768
- Got any more fish?
- Oh, yeah.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.042
Come on, Slappy!

23:53.240 --> 23:55.208
Come on, Slappy, come on!

23:59.360 --> 24:01.966
I think we killed him.

24:04.920 --> 24:09.562
- Nope. He's alive.
- Better get him into some water quick.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.162
I got it. Mr Brinway's hot tub.

24:13.360 --> 24:16.284
- Are you crazy?
- No. Think about it.

24:16.480 --> 24:21.088
It's close by, he doesn't come home
till late and nobody lives there.

24:21.280 --> 24:23.851
Who'd wanna live with Mr Brinway?

24:24.040 --> 24:27.647
- Come on, Slappy, we're in a hurry.
- Come on, Slappy.

24:27.840 --> 24:32.004
- What's he doing?
- It's the fertiliser.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.407
- He smells fish.
- Yeah.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.251
Come on, Slappy!
There's no fish here.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.727
We'll feed you later.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.564
Boo!

25:14.480 --> 25:18.690
- Look, Slappy. Water, just like home.
- No, it's too hot.

25:18.880 --> 25:22.168
And he's probably used to salt water.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.806
- Perfect!
- Come on, Slappy.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.291
Go in and we'll get you some more fish.

25:49.320 --> 25:50.765
Yeah!

25:52.280 --> 25:54.282
Guys, we got trouble.

25:54.480 --> 25:57.245
There's no more F-I-S-H
in the freezer.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.725
This is scary. I think he can spell.

26:09.880 --> 26:15.171
Ahoy, me hearty.
OK, I got five orders of fries and

26:17.640 --> 26:19.529
48 orders of raw fish.

26:19.720 --> 26:23.611
- That's how you want it?
- Yeah. We'll cook it ourselves.

26:23.800 --> 26:28.283
Well, have it your way.
That'll be $155.45.

26:28.480 --> 26:32.451
Oh, charge it to my good old dad,
Morgan Brinway.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.564
Oh, and give yourself a big fat tip.

27:40.520 --> 27:43.285
Guys, I hate to mess up
a good time...

27:43.480 --> 27:45.926
No, you love messing up a good time.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.930
We gotta get to school. It's almost 5.00.

27:49.120 --> 27:52.408
My mom will have a cow
if I'm not there.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.285
Slappy, stay. We'll be back real soon.

27:55.480 --> 27:58.962
- What about Mr Brinway?
- He never leaves right away.

27:59.160 --> 28:02.482
I'm leaving early today, Harriet.
Ow. Ow!

28:03.960 --> 28:08.170
- Everything hurts.
- Maybe your little shirt is too tight.

28:08.360 --> 28:12.285
- Very observant, Harriet.
- You should go home.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.721
Sit in your hot tub and relax.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.366
That's precisely what I'm going to do.

28:31.480 --> 28:34.529
That is one big gopher hole.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.966
Mr Brinway? Mr Brinway...

28:45.160 --> 28:47.049
That's close enough, Roy.

28:47.240 --> 28:52.326
We got a big problem here. We got
a giant gopher on the grounds.

28:52.520 --> 28:56.411
- Really?
- Yeah. I need more gopher bombs.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.364
I'll try to get him tonight.

28:58.560 --> 29:01.450
I may have to go hand-to-hand
with him. He's really big.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.722
How big?

29:03.920 --> 29:07.322
Based on the length of the trench
he dug, I'd say at least

29:07.520 --> 29:09.568
five, six feet long.

29:09.760 --> 29:13.446
Oh. A six-foot gopher.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.971
- Yeah.
- They're a real problem around here.

29:19.160 --> 29:22.482
Them and those 50-foot
killer chipmunks.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.721
50-foot chipmunks?

29:31.240 --> 29:32.810
Nah.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.490
No way.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.841
Not now, Gordon.
Daddy's got a headache.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.965
And this ridiculous little shirt
isn't helping.

30:10.720 --> 30:14.486
Wow, that is a man-sized bark
you've got there, Gordon.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.523
Come here, you.

30:16.720 --> 30:19.883
Come to Papa.
Come here, sit on Daddy's lap.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.526
Gordon Brinway,
are you getting a cold?

30:22.720 --> 30:26.167
I hope not.
You're my best little buddy.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.201
Gordon...breath mints.

30:40.680 --> 30:44.651
Gordon, thank you, I'm fine.
You'll give me your cold.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.483
Ice cubes?

30:48.680 --> 30:52.890
That darned ice-cube maker is
spitting ice cubes on its own again.

30:53.080 --> 30:57.324
Another expense.
Boy, do I need that hot tub.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.564
Ah, Xanadu.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.404
It's a little chilly today, Gordy.

31:38.280 --> 31:40.203
It's...salty.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.050
And fishy.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.402
What the heck is going on
around here?

31:46.680 --> 31:49.604
That's weird.
Mr Brinway left early today.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.326
- He's in the hot tub.
- With Slappy?

31:52.520 --> 31:55.490
- No. With himself.
- Then where's Slappy?

32:05.840 --> 32:08.969
Now that we've found him,
how do we get him out of there?

32:09.160 --> 32:11.766
We'll never sneak past Mr Brinway.

32:11.960 --> 32:15.123
I say we go home
and deny everything.

32:17.720 --> 32:22.169
No wonder it's so cold.
Someone turned the heat off.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.886
Who did that, Gordy?

32:25.080 --> 32:27.526
What's this?

32:28.640 --> 32:30.688
Fish and chips?

32:32.000 --> 32:35.447
Someone had a party.
I'm calling the police.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.202
Now who could that be?

32:45.520 --> 32:47.602
Fish and chips!

32:48.560 --> 32:51.928
All right, all right, I'm coming.
Hold your horses.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.170
Yes?

33:11.360 --> 33:14.569
Gordon! Gordon, Daddy's locked out.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.922
Oh, forget it!

33:38.560 --> 33:41.689
- Hurry, Slappy, hurry!
- Come on.

33:45.160 --> 33:49.529
What do we do with him now?
It's getting late and he looks bushed.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.686
Why me?

33:53.880 --> 33:56.565
You're the only one with a double bed.

33:56.760 --> 33:59.161
My mom'll have us all arrested

33:59.360 --> 34:04.127
if she finds out that this smelly thing
is in here with me.

34:04.320 --> 34:07.324
Witz, two pieces of advice.

34:07.520 --> 34:10.045
Don't insult him.
And try not to wheeze.

34:10.239 --> 34:14.245
Because to a sea lion, a wheeze
could sound like a mating call.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.362
What? A mating call?

34:16.560 --> 34:18.801
Don't go! Don't go!

34:19.000 --> 34:21.606
Guys, don't go! Don't go!

34:32.800 --> 34:35.690
That's it! Get out of the bed!

34:37.199 --> 34:39.009
Oops. Sorry.

34:40.760 --> 34:43.081
Sh! Keep quiet.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.409
Hon? I don't like
the sound of that cough.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.447
I heard it all the way in the kitchen.

34:49.639 --> 34:53.360
Yeah, I'm worried. I don't want
another attack of the croup.

34:53.560 --> 34:56.484
God forbid.
That was the worst week of my life.

34:58.280 --> 35:02.729
Allen! What did you have for lunch?
It smells like a fish fry in here.

35:02.920 --> 35:05.730
Fish fry? In here?

35:06.760 --> 35:09.161
- What is that lump?
- Lump? What lump?

35:11.920 --> 35:14.491
I could've sworn
there was something.

35:14.680 --> 35:18.082
Oh, well. I'll give you
some cough syrup.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.328
There you go.

35:27.520 --> 35:31.127
And I'll give you some Z-Lax Junior.

35:33.040 --> 35:36.362
There you go.
I want you all cleaned out.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.449
Yes, Mom.

35:41.640 --> 35:46.043
Goodnight, honey. I'm sure
you'll feel all better in the morning.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.043
There you are.

35:53.960 --> 35:56.327
Yuck! Sea lion slobber.

35:57.560 --> 36:02.566
Hear that? It's my stomach.
I have to go to the bathroom. Happy?

36:04.200 --> 36:07.283
Now you stay here and keep quiet.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.167
<i>Allen, are you all right in there?</i>

36:39.160 --> 36:40.810
Fine, Mom.

36:42.160 --> 36:46.961
This is what happens when you eat
a whole bar of Z-Lax. It's not candy!

37:13.640 --> 37:17.611
<i>Go for the gopher.
Go for the gopher.</i>

37:54.280 --> 37:58.126
This ought to get me my seal back.
Here, fatty, fatty.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.889
I gotta start using
that StairMaster I stole.

38:21.080 --> 38:25.608
Yeah, great. I found the fish.
Where the hell are my glasses?

38:26.760 --> 38:29.127
OK, big guy.

38:31.120 --> 38:34.681
OK, your digging days are over.

39:08.200 --> 39:09.770
Missed him.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.680
That is one cagey gopher.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.168
You're going home, Slappy.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.964
OK, let's go.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.924
One,

39:27.120 --> 39:29.202
two,

39:30.680 --> 39:32.011
three!

40:13.400 --> 40:16.085
There it is, Slappy. Your home.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.640
I'm gonna miss you, Slappy.

40:21.840 --> 40:25.447
- Me, too, Slap.
- Yeah...so am I.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.405
- We're all gonna miss you, Slappy.
- I'm not.

40:28.600 --> 40:34.050
No of fence. But the sight of you
on my toilet will never leave me.

40:36.960 --> 40:43.286
- Here, Slap. Have one for the road.
- Something's wrong. He's not eating.

40:43.480 --> 40:49.044
That's because there's zillions of fish
out there just waiting for him.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.891
Go on, Slappy, you're free.

40:52.080 --> 40:56.324
- Go on, Slappy, dive in.
- Come on, we gotta get him in there.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.648
He just needs a little push.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.969
Why do I always get stuck
with the butt?

41:04.160 --> 41:06.925
You don't move fast enough!

41:11.520 --> 41:13.727
Go on! Go on!

41:13.920 --> 41:15.843
This way!

41:52.840 --> 41:55.161
Come on! Come on!

42:04.000 --> 42:07.163
Look! It's Willy.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.927
Don't you wanna be with Willy?

42:15.120 --> 42:17.805
Don't killer whales eat sea lions?

42:18.000 --> 42:21.800
Gee! Willy looks hungry.

42:26.040 --> 42:29.840
- Uh-oh.
- Now what?

42:30.040 --> 42:32.691
I say we free Slappy
back into the aquarium.

42:32.880 --> 42:35.486
- You're right, Witz.
- I am?

42:35.680 --> 42:39.890
Yeah, I mean, he wouldn't last
two seconds out there in that ocean.

42:40.080 --> 42:43.289
Yeah, Willy'd eat him up
like a fish burrito.

42:45.360 --> 42:48.250
- We messed up, didn't we?
- Yeah.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.762
We can un-mess it.
We gotta get him back to the aquarium.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.486
That's his real home.

42:54.680 --> 42:57.524
We don't have time.
We're late for Parents' Day.

42:57.720 --> 43:02.726
- We'll take him with us.
- To Parents' Enrichment Day?

43:02.920 --> 43:06.527
- We can hide him behind Roy's shed.
- Yeah, Roy won't mind.

43:06.720 --> 43:11.647
I really think this is a bad idea. I was
right once, I could be right again.

43:14.200 --> 43:17.124
<i>Dartmoor proudly presents

43:17.320 --> 43:22.121
<i>starring in Gilbert & Sullivan's</i>
H.M.S. Pinafore.

43:27.720 --> 43:30.724
Very classy school, huh?
I did ten years here.

43:31.560 --> 43:35.849
Harriet's home-made Swedish
south-western chilli!

43:36.040 --> 43:39.089
Get it while it's hot, hot, hot!

43:39.280 --> 43:42.090
It's an old secret family recipe

43:42.280 --> 43:45.727
passed down from generation
to generation.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.161
From my fingers to your lips.

43:48.360 --> 43:51.284
Don't hawk the chilli
like a cheap carny hustler.

43:51.480 --> 43:54.211
If people are hungry, they'll come over!

43:54.400 --> 43:57.563
- Mr Brinway?
- What is it? Oh, Spencer.

43:57.760 --> 44:03.642
Little Spencer Junior and big Mr Dane.
Now it's Parents' Day.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.810
- We want to try the chilli.
- Excellent choice.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.528
Harriet makes it herself from a secret
Swedish south-western family recipe.

44:11.720 --> 44:14.564
- Don't you, Harriet?
- What do I know?

44:14.760 --> 44:17.889
I'm just a cheap carny hustler.

44:19.480 --> 44:20.970
It's good.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.966
It's very tasty, Harriet.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.731
Thank you, Mr Dane.

44:28.920 --> 44:30.843
Call me Spence.

44:31.040 --> 44:32.724
OK...

44:32.920 --> 44:34.160
Spence.

44:36.360 --> 44:42.367
- You run a tight ship here, Brinway.
- He certainly is dressed for it, isn't he?

44:49.760 --> 44:53.082
I've been meaning to ask you, Spen...
Mr Dane.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.281
Yes, Brinway?

44:57.480 --> 45:00.723
I was hoping you'd honour us
by joining our trustees.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.491
If you could find the time, that is.

45:04.360 --> 45:08.410
If I did, would I be able to get
some more of this excellent chilli?

45:08.600 --> 45:12.286
All you can eat, Spence.

45:14.240 --> 45:17.323
We'll talk later, Brinway. Come on.

45:17.960 --> 45:21.169
Right, Spen... Ah, Mr Dane.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.890
Harriet, this is big.

45:25.080 --> 45:27.287
This is really, really big.

45:28.200 --> 45:32.842
That man invented the bendable straw,
and now he's going to be on my board.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.841
Stinkers.
I wonder what they've been up to.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.725
One of us should've stayed with Slappy.

45:44.920 --> 45:48.129
- He'll be fine.
- He looked hungry when we left.

45:54.080 --> 45:56.321
The gopher's back.

46:39.040 --> 46:41.202
That is one big gopher.

46:41.400 --> 46:45.325
His mom must've been
messing around with a seal.

47:06.880 --> 47:09.201
This is getting boring.

47:10.080 --> 47:13.482
Spencer Junior,
you shouldn't be waiting in line.

47:14.640 --> 47:16.324
Come with me.

47:16.520 --> 47:21.731
Ladies and gentlemen, make way
for Dartmoor's Student of the Year...

47:21.920 --> 47:23.809
Off! Off! Off!

47:24.000 --> 47:25.729
Take a hike!

47:31.440 --> 47:34.649
- Thanks, Mr Brinway.
- Oh, call me Morgan.

47:34.840 --> 47:36.080
Thanks, Morgan.

47:45.800 --> 47:48.565
Anybody see a giant gopher?

47:53.320 --> 47:54.685
Slappy, sh!

48:04.160 --> 48:08.370
- Was that a sea lion?
- Sea lion? I don't think so.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.404
It's only Roy.

48:32.360 --> 48:34.966
Gosh, Roy's gone berserk.

48:37.160 --> 48:39.811
Roy, what are you doing?

48:40.000 --> 48:43.607
I got him, Mr Brinway.
That gopher's in here somewhere.

48:43.800 --> 48:46.883
Somewhere in these bushes.
There he is!

48:47.080 --> 48:52.450
That's not a gopher!
That's a wild sea lion, you imbecile!

48:52.640 --> 48:55.962
Roy, give me that thing
before you destroy something.

48:56.160 --> 48:57.650
Roy!

48:57.840 --> 49:00.605
Roy...let go!

49:06.080 --> 49:07.570
Hey! Hey!

49:07.760 --> 49:11.207
Oh, save yourself, little Spencer Junior!

49:12.080 --> 49:14.924
Hey! My son is on that thing!

49:16.640 --> 49:18.563
Look out, Max!

49:19.680 --> 49:21.330
Spencer!

49:32.640 --> 49:37.202
What kind of a lousy operation
are you running here, Brinway?

49:37.400 --> 49:40.609
- Huh?
- I don't know.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.007
Spencer Junior hurt his arm.

49:43.200 --> 49:47.569
If it is broken, I wouldn't want
to be in your shoes.

49:47.760 --> 49:51.048
Come on. Hold your head up,
we are not embarrassed.

49:51.240 --> 49:54.130
I don't know what school
I'm gonna put you in.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.560
Oy!

49:59.000 --> 50:02.209
Hey, you!
What are you doing with Slappy?

50:02.400 --> 50:06.724
Stand back. I'm from the aquarium.
I'm taking him back where he belongs.

50:06.920 --> 50:10.891
- He hates it in there.
- Stand back. He might bite you.

50:11.080 --> 50:15.085
- He wouldn't bite anybody.
- Just leave him alone!

50:15.280 --> 50:18.489
You? You're in enough trouble as it is.

50:18.680 --> 50:21.251
You're lucky I don't press
seal-napping charges.

50:21.440 --> 50:25.968
- Seal-napping charges? Jail? No good.
- No good.

50:39.360 --> 50:42.682
My beautiful school looks like a war zone.

50:45.960 --> 50:48.611
And you Stinkers are responsible.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.970
All we wanted to do was help Slappy.

50:54.160 --> 50:56.447
It was my idea.

50:56.640 --> 51:00.531
So if you want to be mad at somebody,
you should be mad at me.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.245
And me.

51:02.440 --> 51:03.965
And me.

51:05.280 --> 51:06.691
And me.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.770
I guess me, too.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.850
Well, that's very touching.

51:15.040 --> 51:19.170
Yeah, just like the scene in <i>Spartacus</i>
when they said they were all...

51:19.360 --> 51:23.206
Quiet! You have all broken
double probation.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.288
You don't belong here
at the Dartmoor Academy.

51:30.600 --> 51:33.331
You're all expelled.

51:33.520 --> 51:35.329
For life!

51:43.600 --> 51:49.164
Hi, we're from the Springville Aquarium,
and we got a call about a sea lion here.

51:49.360 --> 51:53.126
You're too late. Some guy from
your aquarium already picked him up.

51:53.320 --> 51:58.008
But that's impossible. We came
right down. What did he look like?

51:58.200 --> 52:01.044
Big, ugly, thick glasses and greasy hair.

52:01.240 --> 52:03.720
Sounds like Boccoli got his sea lion.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.651
- Who's Braccoli?
- Anthony Boccoli.

52:06.840 --> 52:10.049
He's an animal broker and a real low-life.

52:10.240 --> 52:12.288
He bribed a handler to get Slappy.

52:12.480 --> 52:15.006
He teaches the sea lion dog tricks

52:15.200 --> 52:19.125
then sells it to a Bulgarian circus
or wherever.

52:19.320 --> 52:24.565
A Bulgarian circus?
That means Slappy is in big trouble.

52:24.760 --> 52:27.366
But you'll find him and save him, right?

52:27.560 --> 52:30.848
I wish we could,
but the police don't have the time

52:31.040 --> 52:34.010
and we don't have the personnel
to track him down.

52:34.200 --> 52:39.206
All we can do is hope that, wherever
he winds up, they'll treat him well.

53:07.880 --> 53:10.804
- Hey, Roy.
- Hey.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.970
- Hope it's OK we came over.
- You're always welcome.

53:14.160 --> 53:17.084
Just make sure Mr Brinway don't see you.

53:18.800 --> 53:21.087
You guys look kind of down.

53:21.280 --> 53:24.409
We just can't get Slappy
out of our heads.

53:24.600 --> 53:27.683
We freed him when he didn't
want to be freed

53:27.880 --> 53:31.089
then we gave him to a really bad man.

53:31.280 --> 53:35.410
Now when he needs to be freed,
we can't do anything about it.

53:35.600 --> 53:41.050
- Yeah, we're just a bunch of losers.
- That's enough of that kind of talk.

53:41.240 --> 53:44.483
You're Stinkers and
that means something here.

53:44.680 --> 53:48.651
No. You are all special
because of who you are.

53:48.840 --> 53:55.371
Who you are is what makes you special,
because that's all you are - is special!

53:56.240 --> 53:59.562
There. Now how do you feel?

54:00.720 --> 54:03.769
- Lousy.
- Well,

54:03.960 --> 54:07.487
sometimes it works
and sometimes it don't.

54:11.960 --> 54:14.406
- What's this, Roy?
- Careful.

54:14.600 --> 54:18.685
- That's my gopher-bomb launcher.
- Is that all it launches?

54:18.880 --> 54:23.090
No, this launches everything.
Get me one of those potatoes.

54:24.920 --> 54:28.049
- There you go.
- OK. Stand clear.

54:38.320 --> 54:43.008
That sucker's gonna fly a quarter
of a mile due north into the woods.

54:43.200 --> 54:46.124
Isn't that due north?

54:48.440 --> 54:50.044
Oh, yeah.

54:51.320 --> 54:57.168
$155.45 for Barney the Buccaneer's
Fish & Chips?

54:58.000 --> 55:00.765
I never ordered that.

55:01.880 --> 55:06.408
I bet Boccoli has a hideout.
All bad guys have hideouts.

55:06.600 --> 55:10.650
- I don't like where this is going.
- If only we could find his hideout.

55:10.840 --> 55:15.562
- Then we could save Slappy.
- I really don't like where this is going.

55:15.760 --> 55:18.604
If we were him, where would we hide?

55:18.800 --> 55:21.804
Does anybody else
not like where this is going?

55:22.000 --> 55:25.527
One thing for sure,
he'll need a lot of fish.

55:43.040 --> 55:48.206
Do you know a big mean man who
buys a lot of fish and never shaves?

55:49.560 --> 55:53.485
- Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
- I'm going into my pre-hive mode.

55:53.680 --> 55:56.126
- Lot of shellfish around here.
- Hey, look.

55:56.320 --> 55:59.130
The creep's over there buying fish.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.930
Excuse me, sir.

56:08.120 --> 56:10.726
I mean, miss.

56:10.920 --> 56:16.643
That man you just sold fish to,
this kid thinks it's his father.

56:16.840 --> 56:20.162
- What?
- That split on him five years ago.

56:20.360 --> 56:23.250
Ran out on you, huh? Looks the type.

56:23.440 --> 56:26.808
Did he say where he lives?
His mom wants to talk to him.

56:27.000 --> 56:31.164
I bet she does. He tried to get me
to go home with him.

56:31.360 --> 56:36.924
- An old sawmill on Mud Mountain.
- Great, you'll see your daddy again.

56:37.120 --> 56:39.441
Good old Pop.

56:41.200 --> 56:45.205
To do this right, we'll need
a lot of special equipment, Loaf.

56:45.400 --> 56:48.483
- No problem.
- Are you guys nuts?

56:48.680 --> 56:52.890
- We can't go up there. He'll kill us.
- We got Slappy into this.

56:53.080 --> 56:56.448
- We'll get him out.
- We're all Slappy has.

56:56.640 --> 56:59.405
We're his family. Families stick together.

56:59.600 --> 57:03.571
Remember what Roy said? We're Stinkers
and that means something.

57:03.760 --> 57:06.650
- Let's rumble.
- Yeah!

57:10.080 --> 57:13.926
Come along, come along.
What a perfect day for birdwatching.

57:14.120 --> 57:17.329
This is the mating season
for the common loon.

57:17.520 --> 57:19.807
Now I'm excited.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.130
I'm glad you finally got a birdwatching
outfit like mine, Harriet.

57:24.320 --> 57:27.802
Last time you wore that leopard print
you frightened the finches.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.324
Well, I hate it. Now I look like a boy.

57:34.120 --> 57:35.485
Right.

57:36.800 --> 57:41.249
I really miss the Stinkers.
I wonder what they're doing right now.

57:41.440 --> 57:46.002
Well, they're probably doing hard time
at San Quentin Junior Penitentiary.

57:48.160 --> 57:50.208
Gordon, move along, son.

57:50.400 --> 57:52.607
Good boy.

57:53.320 --> 57:55.971
- There it is.
- This place is great.

57:56.160 --> 57:58.288
I found more stuff we can use.

57:58.480 --> 58:02.007
- Everything set?
- We're ready, Sonny.

58:02.200 --> 58:03.690
It's a go.

58:03.880 --> 58:06.770
You wanna eat? You gotta jump, fatso.

58:06.960 --> 58:11.488
I promised these Bulgarians a trained
seal act and that's what I'll deliver.

58:11.680 --> 58:13.728
Come on. Come on.

58:13.920 --> 58:16.526
Come on, get up. Get up!

58:16.720 --> 58:18.643
<i>Anthony Boccoli!</i>

58:18.840 --> 58:22.003
<i>You are surrounded by hundreds
of police</i>

58:22.200 --> 58:23.406
and marines!

58:23.600 --> 58:25.841
Police and marines?

58:26.040 --> 58:28.850
<i>Come out with your hands up!</i>

58:35.760 --> 58:38.331
You're not going anywhere, blubber-puss.

58:44.640 --> 58:48.326
All right, you little piss-ant,
you're in serious trouble now!

58:48.520 --> 58:51.842
- I'll give you a beating you'll never forget.
- Now!

59:07.040 --> 59:09.042
Loser!

59:20.280 --> 59:22.044
What...?

59:23.520 --> 59:25.284
What is that, huh?

59:29.640 --> 59:32.484
I'm being attacked by the Seven Dwarfs!

59:32.680 --> 59:35.081
Where are you? I'll kill you!

59:35.280 --> 59:36.520
Over here!

59:38.240 --> 59:40.163
Wait.

59:40.880 --> 59:43.360
Wait. Wait. Now!

59:43.560 --> 59:45.608
Surprise!

59:53.040 --> 59:56.010
His nose exploded.

59:57.840 --> 59:59.171
Hit it!

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.243
Hit it, Domino!

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.323
- Hit it!
- Domino, hit it now!

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.566
- Nobody leaves here alive.
- Let me go! Let me go!

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.649
Witz, help me!

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:41.448
- What's the matter?
- I'm too skinny, it won't budge.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.890
One, two, three.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.604
Oh, my nose!

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.646
What did I do?

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.204
I'm finished. I'm dying. I'm dead.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.842
- Oh, yes!
- All right!

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.370
I'm alive!

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:27.562
- Witz, you saved me. You're a hero.
- Oh, it was nothing.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.561
Well, it was something.
I don't think I'll ever do it again.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.562
Maybe I will.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.127
I feel pretty good.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.761
Hey, you lousy kids!

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:54.522
You cut me down from here,
or I'll rip you all to pieces!

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.563
Come here! Come here!

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.728
Come back here. If I get a hold of you...

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.242
Oh, no, look at what he did to Slappy.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.766
- All right, you're welcome.
- Gotta find something to bust this.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.964
- How about this?
- Yeah.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.481
- Did I mash your finger?
- No, he's back!

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.047
It's over.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.764
Push!

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.286
- Burning, burning! Hot, hot, hot!
- Come on!

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:48.720
Get outta here!

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.726
What about Slappy?

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.244
- Come on, Slappy, pull.
- Pull, Slappy, pull hard!

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.171
Come on, Slap! Come on, Slap!

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.442
Come on, Slap!

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.927
Yes!

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.324
Oh, no!

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.284
He's stuck. We got to get this chain off.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.528
Wait. I just got an idea.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.840
- Yes.
- Sometimes, things are just that simple.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.528
That guy's like a...blind Terminator!

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.529
Run!

01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.241
- Are you sure this thing'll work?
- Sure I'm sure. I think.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:03.091
- It has to work.
- OK.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.687
- Everybody ready?
- You bet.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.090
We're going too fast. Hit the brakes!

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.408
At least test them.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.603
- They worked.
- Phew.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.720
Come on, show your faces.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.369
Look at that.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.882
What now? Uh-oh!
Guys, you're not gonna believe this.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.446
Oh, no.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.528
- Come on.
- Go, go, go!

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.408
Go faster! Go faster!

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.843
- Sonny, faster!
- Sonny, move it!

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.842
Yeah, come on!

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.403
Watch out!

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.607
Come on, come on!

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.730
Thought I'd sit up here for a while.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.527
- I'm gonna get you punks!
- Sonny, hurry!

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.523
Darn it!

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.522
Mr Brinway?

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.408
- Do you hear that?
- Quiet. It might be the common loon.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.366
They're very rare.
And you don't want to scare it.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.240
Binoculars up.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.843
Look, he's wiggling his tail feathers.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.366
Harriet, will you hold my sunglasses?

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.006
Hush, Gordon Brinway, hush!

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:11.330
Hush!
You'll frighten the loons, son.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.320
Look out, Mr Brinway!

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.485
Attaboy, Gordon.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.366
- Mr Brinway, what are you doing here?
- Stop! Stop this thing!

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.121
- We can't. We're on the I am.
- Yeah!

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.566
- Slow down! Slow down!
- Sonny, where are you going?

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.240
He can't follow us in there.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.161
Brake it! Brake it!

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.761
Brake! Brake! Brake!

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.687
Whoa. Whoa!

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.089
Whoa! Everybody, lean back!

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:08.162
That's it. I'm getting off
this ridiculous contraption.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:11.807
- Stay down, Mr Brinway.
- Stop touching me!

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.527
- Sit down or you'll tip us over.
- No, it's Boccoli again.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.691
- What's Broccoli?
- Anthony Boccoli, he's gonna kill us.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.929
What is he talking about?

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.725
We can go down the flume into the lake.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.402
- Oh, like fun we will!
- He'll never follow us.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.241
- How do you know?
- Would you, if you didn't have to?

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:39.121
- Well, I'm not going.
- Oh, yes, you are, Mr Brinway.

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:41.129
But I can't swim.

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:44.961
What are you worried about?
The fall will probably kill you.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.488
Water?

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:04.408
Bye-bye, you little punks.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:16.082
Must be freakin' clogged.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.170
Why, you...!

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.844
Water!

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.644
- Water!
- The lake!

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.841
- Get ready!
- All set.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.443
- I'm a test pilot! I'm a test pilot!
- This is great!

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.883
Who cares?
I'm gonna die with the Stinkers!

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.411
Loaf, hit it!

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.721
- Wow!
- Wow!

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.651
- Wow!
- Wow!

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.525
Loaf, you're a genius.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.127
- All right!
- We're saved!

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.802
Look at that!

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.728
That has got to hurt.
