01:37.898 --> 01:39.533
Come on. Sit down.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.642
Hey, look at me.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.183
You're going to be okay.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.594
Here.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.429
Drink this.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.563
Come on.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.945
What have I done?

02:25.012 --> 02:27.481
You did what you had to do.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.931
I killed a man once.

03:00.381 --> 03:04.352
He was a...a hijacker.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.255
He was going to shoot me.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.825
He didn't know I had
a gun in the truck.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.568
How do you live with that?

03:24.838 --> 03:26.307
It changes you.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.511
But you go on.
You have to, Juliana.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.986
You read my letter.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.357
I got worried after you said
you might not come back.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.393
I'm sorry.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.932
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I lied to you.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.103
Look, you just, uh,
try and get some sleep.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.571
Yeah.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.809
In the morning
we'll get you home.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.211
I can't go home.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.615
Juliana, has it ever
occurred to you

04:07.681 --> 04:09.850
that maybe
there is no contact?

04:09.917 --> 04:13.321
That your sister would
have walked into the
same trap you just did?

04:15.055 --> 04:16.857
I got to do this.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.627
I got to.

04:19.693 --> 04:20.994
You know,
that guy tonight

04:21.061 --> 04:22.663
was most likely
a Nazi agent.

04:25.933 --> 04:26.867
I know.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.536
Then you know both of us
would be killed

04:28.602 --> 04:29.770
if anyone found out
what happened.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.739
I never meant
for you to be there.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.343
I know you didn't,
but I was.

04:41.915 --> 04:45.519
Somebody's going to come
looking for that man,

04:45.586 --> 04:48.456
and we can't be here
when they do.

Kido: Your sister Laura
and her children
will be exterminated.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.590
Randall:
It's a lie, Frank.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.892
That film can
change the world.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.494
Kido:
Where is Juliana Crain?

06:00.561 --> 06:01.762
Randall: Stay strong.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.597
...a woman who thinks
you are a failure?

06:03.664 --> 06:06.099
Tough choice, Frank.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.469
Is it worth dying for?

06:18.446 --> 06:20.481
What's wrong?

06:21.449 --> 06:24.284
I lost something.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.753
A drawing.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.658
We got to get going.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.362
Clerk's not up yet.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.364
Here's your key.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.500
Why? What are you doing?

06:39.567 --> 06:41.469
Checking out.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.136
Oh, no. That man dies,

06:43.203 --> 06:44.171
and suddenly
we just disappear.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.172
How's that going to look?

06:45.238 --> 06:46.474
Like we left.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.742
We can't wait around here.

06:48.809 --> 06:52.546
We'll leave-- not in a hurry
and not together.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.381
Look, what if you drive
out of town this morning

06:54.482 --> 06:55.983
and I stay at the diner
till after lunch?

06:56.049 --> 06:57.184
Then I'll meet you.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.154
Okay.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.390
I'll wait outside town.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.392
Where are you going?

07:05.493 --> 07:06.960
To get ready for work.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.748
Hope I didn't scare you.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.822
- No.
- You okay?

07:34.888 --> 07:36.924
Yeah.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.793
Your door was open.
This was on your step.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.373
Oh, Jesus.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.709
They really did a number
on this place.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.016
What's it say?

08:44.592 --> 08:45.759
You confirm these
as the bodies

08:45.826 --> 08:49.029
of Laura Frink Crothers,

08:49.096 --> 08:52.032
Emily Alice Crothers,
and John Thomas Crothers?

08:54.602 --> 08:56.503
Sign here.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.471
Mr. Frink?

08:58.606 --> 08:59.940
Mr. Frink?

09:08.716 --> 09:10.383
As enemies of the state,

09:10.450 --> 09:11.652
they've lost
all burial rights.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.020
They will be cremated

09:13.086 --> 09:15.022
within the next
seven to ten days.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.990
You'll receive
notice in the mail.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.239
Hey.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.247
Have you got a cigarette?

10:14.314 --> 10:15.248
Yeah. Sure.

10:32.900 --> 10:36.069
Hey. Hey, let me.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.909
Here you go, pal.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.380
What was that about?

10:49.783 --> 10:52.252
It's better not to ask.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.071
Jesus. Here by popular demand,

11:11.138 --> 11:14.775
your occupying overlords
the Crown Prince and Princess.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.322
Fuck 'em.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.625
Come on.
We got to get to work.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.194
I'm not going.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.331
Frank, you didn't
call in sick yesterday.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.800
You miss today--

11:41.268 --> 11:42.770
All right, I'll tell them
that you're so sick,

11:42.803 --> 11:44.137
you can't make it
to the phone,

11:44.204 --> 11:47.007
that you're puking up
blood and organs and shit.

12:26.079 --> 12:26.980
Sir.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.916

12:28.982 --> 12:32.019
Joe Blake with a progress
report, line 2.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.062
Good morning, Joe.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.696
Good morning, sir.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.833
Still no word
from our contact?

12:45.833 --> 12:47.901
I don't know
what else I can do

12:47.968 --> 12:49.602
except show myself and wait.

12:49.669 --> 12:53.073
What about your, uh,
S.D. man?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.208
The one who makes
the origami?

12:56.676 --> 12:58.745
No. He seemed
to have left town.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.848
Good.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.483
So should you.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.619
What? Why?

13:06.686 --> 13:08.055
It's been two days, Joe.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.156
If they were going
to contact you,

13:09.222 --> 13:10.157
they'd have done it by now.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.159
So the mission's a failure?

13:12.225 --> 13:14.928
Not necessarily.
You still have the film.

13:14.995 --> 13:18.131
But just getting the film
wasn't my objective, sir.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.969
No.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.904
No, it wasn't.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.874
I don't understand.
What did I do wrong?

13:26.907 --> 13:28.508
Perhaps nothing.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.378
You'll have a full debriefing
when you get back.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.517
Do you understand me, Joe?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.688
My orders are clear?

13:41.754 --> 13:43.556
Yes, sir, very clear.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.227
Heil Hitler.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.097
Heil Hitler.

Hello.

14:26.566 --> 14:30.237
Frank, it's me.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.271
Hello?

14:37.844 --> 14:39.246
Yeah, Jules.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.214
I've been so worried
about you, Frank.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.950
I tried to reach you
a few times.

14:43.016 --> 14:46.153
[clicking]

14:50.423 --> 14:54.227
Uh, but there's no phone
at the campsite, is there?

14:56.863 --> 14:59.366
No. No.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.834
Uh, there isn't.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.804
You know, you left
your necklace.

15:04.871 --> 15:09.109
I figured if you saw it,
you'd know I left.

15:09.176 --> 15:12.412
I-- I'm sorry, Frank.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.655
Are you okay, Frank?

15:24.357 --> 15:27.127
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.497
Frank--

15:34.901 --> 15:37.070
I miss you so much.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.073
Look, I got to go.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.209
I-- I love you, Frank.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.205
Hello.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.378
Hello.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.048
Uh, excuse me.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.216
You know where I can
find the attendant here?

16:27.620 --> 16:29.256
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.651
Bucket.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.658
Oh. Hey, Marshal.
What can I do for you?

17:05.725 --> 17:06.926
Gas.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.495
Hey, can I get s--

17:11.598 --> 17:13.166
Who are you?

17:15.368 --> 17:17.770
Nobody.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.439
Is that your truck,
nobody?

17:21.608 --> 17:22.909
Yeah.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.745
Let me see
your I.D. papers.

17:28.115 --> 17:31.118
There aren't
any cops around here,
so the way I see it--

17:36.523 --> 17:38.458
Okay.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.627
Just let me get it
out of the truck first.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.044
What's in the truck,
Joe Blake?

17:58.145 --> 17:59.512
Coffee makers.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.149
Right.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.154
Hey, can I get some of that?

18:07.154 --> 18:10.357
Bucket,
you seen this fella?

18:11.824 --> 18:14.461
I don't think so.
Who is he?

18:14.527 --> 18:15.862
He's a friend.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.365
Lot of guys
look like him.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.835
This guy makes
little paper animals.

18:22.902 --> 18:26.639
Oh. Yeah. I seen him.

18:26.706 --> 18:27.640
Where?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.642
Talking to Carl
over at the bookstore.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.181
Where are you going?

18:34.181 --> 18:36.616
To get a cup of coffee.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.752
Hey, Bucket,
fill it up, will you?

18:51.564 --> 18:52.965
I thought
you were leaving.

18:53.032 --> 18:54.334
Pour the coffee.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.838
What's going on?

18:58.905 --> 19:00.440
There's a man out there

19:00.507 --> 19:02.008
with a sawed-off
shotgun,

19:02.074 --> 19:04.010
and he's looking
for a friend of his.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.579
That didn't take long.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.248
He's going to figure out
pretty fast

19:08.315 --> 19:09.349
that that man's dead.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.518
So what do we do?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.453
We leave.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.655
First we have to
get rid of something.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.426
I'll meet you out back.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.593
Yeah.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.761
[coin clatters]

19:26.098 --> 19:27.400
You know,
you should be careful

19:27.467 --> 19:29.636
who you should make
friends with out here.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.571
You're not so bad.

19:31.638 --> 19:35.508
Trudy,
I'm not your friend.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.521
Ah. There you are.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.122
12 marks.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.424
Shew.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.493
You know how much a tank
costs in the Reich?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.895
You're lucky I got
any gas at all.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.632
Hey, who is that guy?

20:00.967 --> 20:02.502
Calls himself the Marshal.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.205
He's just a dirty
old bounty hunter.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.474
Likes to call himself that.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.576
You'll
want to steer clear.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.679
Yeah. Thanks.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.359
What is that smell in here?

20:28.160 --> 20:29.862
How would you describe it?

20:29.929 --> 20:31.798
I couldn't say.

20:31.864 --> 20:35.568
Hmm. You couldn't say.

20:35.635 --> 20:38.338
You probably spend
so much time in here,

20:38.405 --> 20:39.872
you don't notice.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.277
The old books.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.946
They got the stink
of their owner.

20:48.581 --> 20:54.887
Cigarettes and coffee,
cat piss, smell of decay.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.628
I'm looking
for a friend of mine

21:01.694 --> 21:04.096
who was supposed to
meet me this morning.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.632
He didn't show.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.334
You seen him?

21:17.610 --> 21:19.946
Y-Yeah, I did
a couple days ago.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.650
What did he want in here?

21:26.185 --> 21:28.855
You don't want
to lie to me, Carl.

21:28.921 --> 21:32.058
Yeah.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.026
H-He bought a Bible.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.096
Tsk tsk tsk.

21:37.163 --> 21:40.400
You're going around
selling Bibles?

21:46.238 --> 21:48.408
I need to find
my friend, Carl.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.611
I don't know
where he is, I swear.

21:51.678 --> 21:52.912
Hmm.

21:52.979 --> 21:56.683
He send anyone else
in here buying Bibles?

21:58.651 --> 22:01.020
Um...

22:01.087 --> 22:02.522
a girl.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.693
Uh, she's in her 20s...

22:07.960 --> 22:10.797
brown hair,

22:10.863 --> 22:11.831
pretty.

22:11.898 --> 22:12.965
And you wouldn't know

22:13.032 --> 22:14.801
where I could find this
pretty girl, would you?

22:19.972 --> 22:21.408
No, I don't.

22:23.042 --> 22:26.646
Selling Bibles is
a risky business, Carl.

22:26.713 --> 22:29.416
There isn't a law against it.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.818
Only because there's
no law around here,

22:31.884 --> 22:33.853
it doesn't make it right,
does it?

22:37.256 --> 22:38.825
How many you got back there?

22:41.594 --> 22:43.463
Six, maybe seven.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.064
I-- I'll burn them.

22:49.235 --> 22:51.103
That would be wise, Carl.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.618
That is your name, right?

23:07.153 --> 23:08.120
Carl?

23:09.922 --> 23:11.057
Y-Yes.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.492
You sure?

23:24.003 --> 23:26.906
You sure it isn't...

23:26.973 --> 23:28.007
David?

23:29.476 --> 23:31.478
David P. Frees?

23:32.479 --> 23:33.913
Salem, Ohio,

23:33.980 --> 23:38.485
escaped from a camp
outside New Berlin in '54?

23:38.518 --> 23:40.587
No, sir, that's not me.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.557
I think it is.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.032
I'm going to kill you now.

23:53.099 --> 23:57.169
There's nothing you can
say or do about that.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.675
But I'm going to need
something first.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.589
[speaking Japanese]

26:23.282 --> 26:25.484
Mr. Baynes.

26:25.551 --> 26:27.654
Trade Minister.

26:27.687 --> 26:32.024
It's a lovely day
and a long time coming.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.794
And you intend to proceed?

26:36.095 --> 26:38.765
I need the name
of my contact.

26:44.570 --> 26:48.107
That man over there--
suit and blue tie.

26:48.174 --> 26:52.344
He's Shimura,
Science Minister.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.445
What have you told him?

26:53.512 --> 26:54.947
Nothing yet.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.150
Is this some kind of a joke?

26:58.217 --> 27:00.486
Mr. Baynes, you have not
exposed yourself,

27:00.552 --> 27:01.921
and neither have I,

27:01.988 --> 27:05.324
nor will I until I must.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.358
Which is when?

27:06.425 --> 27:09.762
During His Highness' speech.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.363
The Nazi Embassy.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.367
In front
of all those people?

27:15.434 --> 27:17.770
The crowd will provide cover.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.072
It's the only opportunity.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.727
Hey, buddy, what are you
doing out here?

27:44.530 --> 27:45.965
Let me tell you,

27:46.032 --> 27:47.734
12-hour flight from Tokyo,

27:47.767 --> 27:48.968
I could use a belt.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.838
Jesus, what happened?

27:51.904 --> 27:53.840
You run into a pole
or something?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.747
They're gone, Bill.

28:00.747 --> 28:03.783
You sure? Laura's
usually home by now.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.752
They're not coming home.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.426
What?

28:14.493 --> 28:15.995
God, Bill, I am so sorry.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.629
What are you talking about?

28:17.764 --> 28:20.232
The Kempeitai,
they killed them.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.568
They-- They just killed
them last night.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.403
The Kempeitai?

28:24.470 --> 28:25.671
Yeah.

28:25.772 --> 28:27.774
That makes no sense.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.876
What the fuck
are you saying?

28:31.443 --> 28:32.411
The kids?

28:34.613 --> 28:36.548
They-- They said
they were Jews.

28:36.615 --> 28:37.616
But they're not.

28:37.683 --> 28:38.785
Our grandfather
was Jewish,

28:38.851 --> 28:39.952
Laura's and mine.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.788
So that means
you're a Jew, right?

28:41.854 --> 28:42.789
Why didn't they kill you?

28:42.855 --> 28:45.858
I-- I don't know.

28:45.925 --> 28:49.061
Bill, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

28:49.128 --> 28:52.264
- Get away from me, Frank.
- Please, Bill.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.967
- Bill!
- I said get the hell
away from me!

29:52.624 --> 29:54.861
Listen up!

29:54.927 --> 29:57.329
When I'm done,

29:57.396 --> 29:58.730
tie him off.

29:58.865 --> 30:01.834
Leave him here.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.003
You understand?

30:04.937 --> 30:06.705
Nobody cuts that body down

30:06.772 --> 30:09.008
till the birds
pick it clean.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.693
[voice distorted]
We administered

30:27.759 --> 30:29.828
200 micrograms
of D-lysergic acid

30:29.896 --> 30:31.964
30 minutes ago.

30:32.031 --> 30:35.001
Advanced interrogation
technique.

30:35.067 --> 30:37.269
It's intended
to break down inhibitions,

30:37.336 --> 30:38.470
psychic barriers,

30:38.537 --> 30:41.340
inducing a sensation
of oneness.

30:41.407 --> 30:42.942
Oneness?

30:43.009 --> 30:46.445
Some describe it as
an oceanic experience,

30:46.512 --> 30:48.480
a unity with all things.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.750
I fail to see
how that would lead

30:51.817 --> 30:53.785
to the disclosure
of information.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.154
In such a state,

30:55.221 --> 30:57.389
the subject feels no reason
to hold anything back.

30:57.456 --> 31:01.493
There is no reason
since he is connected to
everything and everyone.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.402
Mr. Meyer.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.271
[distorted]
How did you know the route

31:12.338 --> 31:14.306
my car would be
taking yesterday?

31:14.373 --> 31:18.377
[normal] Do you have
an informant in my office?

31:21.547 --> 31:23.215
You have a halo.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.519
The medication often
induces hallucinations.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.530
Tell me the name
of your informant.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.143
You're an angel.

31:52.178 --> 31:53.845
Enough. Will you
bring him out of this?

31:53.980 --> 31:55.781
I am deeply sorry,
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

31:55.847 --> 31:57.616
- I cannot do that.
- You can't?

31:57.683 --> 31:59.051
Once administered,

31:59.118 --> 32:01.553
it takes hours for
the medication to wear off.

32:01.620 --> 32:02.888
I see.

32:02.989 --> 32:06.525
So this man
tries to kill me,

32:06.592 --> 32:10.997
and we reward him with
an oceanic experience.

32:13.365 --> 32:18.004
Will you tell me when this
little fantasy has worn off?

32:19.205 --> 32:27.646
* Summertime *

32:27.713 --> 32:30.749
*And the livin' *

32:30.816 --> 32:36.022
* Is easy *

32:37.556 --> 32:38.557
* Fish... *

32:38.624 --> 32:40.126
I'll take care of this.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.428
No, I can deal
with it.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.296
I did this.

32:44.363 --> 32:49.068
* And the cotton is high *

32:49.135 --> 32:51.037
We need to find his keys.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.538
Do you think
they're still on him?

32:52.604 --> 32:54.540
They'd better be.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.075
We need to move his car.

32:56.142 --> 32:59.111
* Your daddy's rich *

33:00.279 --> 33:04.050
* And your ma is-- *

33:04.083 --> 33:05.051
[groans]

33:05.117 --> 33:09.488
* ...good-lookin' *

33:11.723 --> 33:13.659
* So hush, little baby *

33:13.725 --> 33:17.063
- All right.
- Okay.

33:17.129 --> 33:25.704
* Baby, don't you cry *

33:27.839 --> 33:34.713
* One of these mornings *

33:34.780 --> 33:41.620
*You're gonna
rise up singin' *

33:43.822 --> 33:51.597
* You're gonna
spread your wings *

33:51.663 --> 33:59.171
* And you'll take to the sky *

34:01.273 --> 34:03.542
* You're gonna ride *

34:03.609 --> 34:04.610
Got a light?

34:04.676 --> 34:06.212
Uh, sorry, I don't smoke.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.447
That's good. You live
longer that way.

34:10.116 --> 34:12.251
Uh, look, I don't
want to be rude,

34:12.318 --> 34:14.620
uh, but I'm not in the mood
for small talk.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.588
I understand.

34:16.655 --> 34:20.126
I don't blame you after
what you've been through.

34:20.159 --> 34:23.562
Sake cocktail, please,
and some matches?

34:27.966 --> 34:29.735
You're lucky to be alive.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.437
That Kido released you,

34:31.503 --> 34:33.439
but only because he
still wants to find
your girlfriend.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.207
Just get the hell
away from me, all right?

34:35.274 --> 34:37.176
I don't want any part
of your movement

34:37.243 --> 34:38.777
or whatever the hell it is.
If they saw me--

34:43.149 --> 34:44.816
Jesus.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.154
Tell me what Randall
said to you

34:48.220 --> 34:49.521
and to them.

34:49.588 --> 34:52.023
Randall--

34:52.158 --> 34:53.459
Well, Randall
was in the next cell.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.161
- He didn't say anything.
- You sure about that?

34:55.227 --> 34:56.528
That's why they shot him.

35:02.368 --> 35:04.903
Hey, relax, Frank.

35:04.970 --> 35:06.205
We're on
the same side here.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.574
I am not on your side.

35:08.640 --> 35:12.544
Your side got my sister
killed and her kids.

35:12.611 --> 35:16.014
My side
didn't kill them.
The pawns did.

35:16.081 --> 35:19.251
A lot of us paid a price
like you, Frank.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.320
I lost my husband
and two brothers.

35:21.387 --> 35:24.190
They-- They come at us
with guns and gas chambers,

35:24.256 --> 35:26.258
and you, hmm? You just
aim a movie at them.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.927
How about you put
some of their blood on
the streets for a change?

35:28.994 --> 35:30.962
It's not that simple, Frank.
We weaken the Japs too much,

35:31.029 --> 35:32.798
and we're just begging Berlin
to drop another bomb.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.433
So you just watch old movies.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.068
The films are more
important than you know.

35:37.203 --> 35:41.973
* So hush, little baby *

35:42.040 --> 35:50.682
* Baby, don't you cry *

35:54.653 --> 35:57.055
Reiss: We are honored that you
found time in your schedule

35:57.122 --> 35:58.590
to visit with us,
Your Highness.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.592
The solidarity
between our nations

36:00.659 --> 36:03.562
is foremost in my mind,
Ambassador Reiss.

36:03.629 --> 36:06.097
And it's time
we greeted our subjects

36:06.232 --> 36:09.701
in the Pacific States
in person.

36:09.768 --> 36:15.241
Yes, which makes
my next request
very difficult.

36:18.109 --> 36:19.945
We respectfully request

36:20.011 --> 36:22.248
that the Crown Prince
cancel his public address

36:22.248 --> 36:24.015
outside the Embassy.

36:24.082 --> 36:25.351
This is not a proper request

36:25.417 --> 36:26.752
to be made in the presence
of His Highness.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.820
No, Trade Minister.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.489
I want to hear why.

36:30.556 --> 36:33.492
And I want to hear it
from the person

36:33.559 --> 36:35.461
actually making the request.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.303
I have received word
from New York.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.305
The Resistance
are stepping up
their attacks.

36:46.372 --> 36:49.875
I understand and thank you
for your concern,

36:49.941 --> 36:53.379
but my Imperial Guard
and the Kempeitai

36:53.445 --> 36:55.614
provide excellent security.

36:55.681 --> 36:58.083
We have obtained evidence

36:58.149 --> 37:01.287
that the Resistance
are in possession
of false travel papers.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.555
You have knowledge
of such a threat

37:03.622 --> 37:05.524
against the Crown Prince?

37:06.925 --> 37:09.295
Not direct knowledge, no,

37:09.361 --> 37:11.863
but the safety
of Your Highness

37:11.930 --> 37:13.299
is our paramount concern.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.735
Thank you, Ambassador,

37:16.802 --> 37:20.772
but I will address
my people in person.

37:23.375 --> 37:26.812
We ask that your guards
remain vigilant, Mr. Tagomi,

37:26.878 --> 37:28.780
because we certainly will.

37:33.852 --> 37:37.423
Thank you for the tea
and your hospitality.

38:04.950 --> 38:09.621
Are you aware of any threats
such as OberfÃ¼hrer mentioned?

38:09.688 --> 38:12.257
There are many threats,
Trade Minister,

38:12.358 --> 38:16.362
not least from Nazi agents
seeking to destabilize us

38:16.428 --> 38:18.830
and blame their crimes
on subversives.

38:18.897 --> 38:22.734
So you're comfortable with
the Crown Prince proceeding?

38:22.801 --> 38:25.003
The Imperial Guard
vouch for his safety.

38:26.171 --> 38:27.973
And the false travel papers?

38:28.039 --> 38:29.775
What about them?

38:29.841 --> 38:33.011
Who might be carrying them
or if in fact they exist.

38:33.078 --> 38:35.514
Matters
of internal security

38:35.581 --> 38:37.816
do not concern
the Trade Ministry.

38:50.396 --> 38:53.231
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer,
the subject is recovered

38:53.298 --> 38:55.401
from his exposure
to the D-lysergic acid.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.770
He says he needs
to see you and only you.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.103
Hey, Mister.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.276
Look at you.

39:38.343 --> 39:39.678
You're looking
for that man,

39:39.745 --> 39:42.047
the one who makes
the paper birds?

39:42.113 --> 39:44.516
What if I am?

39:44.583 --> 39:46.818
I know where he went.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.521
Give me 2 marks,
and I'll tell you.

39:52.491 --> 39:55.226
You tell me
or I'll kill you.

39:55.293 --> 39:57.262
I saw him drive
down that way

39:57.328 --> 39:59.197
late last night.

39:59.264 --> 40:01.099
What kind of car?

40:01.166 --> 40:04.503
An old one, black.

40:04.570 --> 40:05.904
Where was he going?

40:05.971 --> 40:07.172
I don't know.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.218
All right,
let's go.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.854
Hey, is this far?

40:58.056 --> 41:00.692
It's a couple miles,
maybe.

41:00.759 --> 41:03.161
He marked it on the map.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.195
What do you think it is?

41:06.397 --> 41:08.199
I know what you're thinking.

41:08.266 --> 41:09.668
We do not have time for this.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.770
You don't have to come.
I'm doing this.

41:11.837 --> 41:14.540
Hey, haven't you
had enough?

41:19.010 --> 41:20.111
[ring]

41:22.047 --> 41:23.549
Captain Connolly.

41:28.286 --> 41:31.557
Mr. Connolly, please join us.

41:31.557 --> 41:32.858
Yes, ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.095
As you can see,

41:37.162 --> 41:42.901
Mr. Meyer has recovered
from his hallucinations.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.905
He's just told me something
very interesting.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.043
I'm sorry.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.780
What did he tell you?

41:56.648 --> 41:58.917
He's named you
as a conspirator.

42:02.153 --> 42:04.723
That's r--
That's ridiculous.

42:05.691 --> 42:08.193
It's obviously a lie.

42:08.259 --> 42:10.028
Why would he name you?

42:10.095 --> 42:11.863
I don't know.

42:11.930 --> 42:14.666
I've never
met this man.

42:16.434 --> 42:20.806
An informant doesn't have
to meet his co-conspirators.

42:22.608 --> 42:23.675
Sit down.

42:26.144 --> 42:29.615
No, he just has to pass on
the information.

42:29.648 --> 42:31.482
What information?

42:31.617 --> 42:34.620
The route of my car,
Captain.

42:42.027 --> 42:43.762
I've only been loyal,
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

42:43.829 --> 42:45.831
Whatever he said,
he's lying.

42:49.134 --> 42:51.903
Tell him now.

42:52.971 --> 42:55.306
This-- This man is lying.

42:55.373 --> 42:56.775
I don't think so, Captain.

42:56.842 --> 43:00.879
Mr. Meyer has given me
a very detailed account

43:00.946 --> 43:03.782
of how you passed on
the information.

43:07.719 --> 43:08.920
Explain yourself.

43:08.987 --> 43:11.289
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer, I--

43:11.356 --> 43:13.659
i-it's not true.

43:13.692 --> 43:15.661
Just tell him it's not true.

43:15.661 --> 43:17.028
Th-There's no proof,

43:17.095 --> 43:18.697
just the word
of this Semite.

43:18.764 --> 43:19.831
Tell me, Captain.

43:19.898 --> 43:21.667
I have nothing to confess.

43:21.667 --> 43:23.401
- Tell me now.
- Please, this is a trick.

43:23.468 --> 43:24.402
It's a lie.

43:24.469 --> 43:25.737
Are you saying I'm a fool?

43:25.804 --> 43:27.205
I've allowed myself
to be deceived?

43:27.272 --> 43:28.239
No, of course not.

43:28.306 --> 43:29.908
So he's telling the truth.

43:29.975 --> 43:32.711
He's not! Please tell him
you're lying.

43:33.979 --> 43:35.480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

43:35.546 --> 43:36.982
[click]

43:50.328 --> 43:52.163
You knew he was lying.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.733
No. I suspected.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.868
You may be relieved,
Captain,

43:56.935 --> 43:59.705
but we still don't know
how they got to us.

44:07.612 --> 44:08.747
Can I come in?

44:17.522 --> 44:18.724
You want a drink?

44:18.790 --> 44:21.092
I've just been
to the Kempeitai.

44:22.728 --> 44:24.229
They didn't tell me
exactly what happened,

44:24.295 --> 44:27.132
but they did say it wasn't
about Laura and the kids.

44:32.170 --> 44:33.905
It was about your crazy
fucking girlfriend.

44:33.972 --> 44:35.140
- It wasn't like that.
- This is her fault.

44:35.206 --> 44:36.474
She and that sister
of hers did something

44:36.541 --> 44:37.776
and dragged
the rest of us into it.

44:37.843 --> 44:39.010
That's the only reason
they're dead.

44:39.077 --> 44:40.411
They tortured me.
They beat me.

44:40.478 --> 44:41.847
For what?

44:41.913 --> 44:43.982
For, uh, information
I couldn't give them.

44:44.049 --> 44:47.085
Couldn't or wouldn't?

44:50.155 --> 44:52.423
I did not kill Laura
and the kids.

44:55.426 --> 44:56.661
The Kempeitai did.

44:56.762 --> 44:58.196
This is their
country, Frank!

44:58.263 --> 44:59.497
Don't you get it?

44:59.564 --> 45:01.399
Yeah.

45:01.466 --> 45:03.301
Yeah, I get it.

45:04.870 --> 45:07.272
You always wanted to have
kids, didn't you, Frank?

45:08.874 --> 45:11.843
Well, I hope you do one day,

45:11.910 --> 45:14.279
and I hope they're
taken away from you

45:14.345 --> 45:16.414
like you took mine from me

45:16.481 --> 45:20.251
so you could feel
the same pain I'm feeling.

45:20.318 --> 45:22.954
Announcer on TV:
...sail upon this ship
do their duty

45:23.021 --> 45:24.956
with honor and integrity

45:25.023 --> 45:27.425
for the betterment
of our glorious empire.

45:27.492 --> 45:29.961
His Royal Highness
the Crown Prince

45:30.028 --> 45:32.130
and Her Royal Highness
the Crown Princess

45:32.197 --> 45:34.332
began the day at
the Shinto Temple

45:34.399 --> 45:35.600
in the Pan Pacific park

45:35.666 --> 45:38.469
by making their offering
to Amaterasu,

45:38.536 --> 45:40.605
the Goddess of the Sun.

45:40.671 --> 45:43.441
In one of the highlights
of the Crown Prince's visit,

45:43.508 --> 45:46.812
he will speak in front
of the Nazi embassy
in a public address.

45:46.845 --> 45:50.481
All subjects of the Pacific
States are invited.

46:37.863 --> 46:39.464
Pretty girl.

47:00.251 --> 47:02.020
It should just be
up through those trees.

47:05.957 --> 47:09.027
Thanks for coming with me.

47:09.094 --> 47:10.528
We shouldn't be doing this.

47:10.595 --> 47:12.597
I don't understand you.

47:12.663 --> 47:14.232
You would if you
saw that film.

47:15.433 --> 47:17.335
Yeah? A film that shows
another world? So what?

47:17.402 --> 47:19.604
So it means
that maybe things don't
have to be this way.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.739
Maybe the world can change.

47:21.806 --> 47:24.375
I don't see how.

47:24.442 --> 47:25.911
[sigh]

47:25.911 --> 47:27.545
You sound like Frank.

47:31.782 --> 47:34.352
Well, I'm starting
to like Frank.

47:35.553 --> 47:37.188
You ever think
how different life could be

47:37.255 --> 47:39.057
if you could change
just one thing?

47:41.426 --> 47:42.928
Like what?

47:45.163 --> 47:47.598
My dad died during the war.

47:52.637 --> 47:55.606
And I don't know who I'd be
if that hadn't happened.

47:55.673 --> 47:57.308
Come on.

48:11.189 --> 48:12.958
Hey, hold up a second.

48:17.162 --> 48:18.629
Listen, I lied to you, too.

48:24.502 --> 48:26.704
Maybe I'm following
in my father's footsteps,

48:26.771 --> 48:28.173
maybe I'm not.

48:29.574 --> 48:31.142
I've never even met him.

48:35.346 --> 48:38.116
He wasn't married to my--
my mother, and--

48:42.720 --> 48:46.257
he doesn't live near us.
He never took any interest.

48:48.426 --> 48:50.261
I'm sorry.

48:50.328 --> 48:51.997
Whew.
Yeah, well, I don't know

48:51.997 --> 48:53.831
why I felt I had
to tell you this.

48:53.898 --> 48:55.400
I'm glad you did.

48:57.102 --> 48:59.004
You know,
m-maybe you're right.

49:00.138 --> 49:01.339
Maybe if I'd met you sooner,

49:01.406 --> 49:03.241
my life would be
a whole lot different.

49:07.145 --> 49:09.147
Well, now you have.

49:10.481 --> 49:12.550
Maybe it will be.

49:26.831 --> 49:28.099
Hey, Frank.

49:30.035 --> 49:31.202
What are you doing here,
buddy?

49:31.269 --> 49:33.604
I got to work to eat.

49:33.671 --> 49:35.406
Well, good. Great.

49:35.473 --> 49:37.908
Uh, did you tell
Mr. Wyndam-Matson you're here?

49:38.043 --> 49:40.045
Yeah, yeah. I told him.

49:40.878 --> 49:42.047
Well, good. It's, uh,

49:42.080 --> 49:43.514
good to have you
back, Frank.

49:43.581 --> 49:45.050
Really good.

49:51.789 --> 49:53.258
That's got to be it.

50:43.141 --> 50:44.709
Oh, my God.

50:55.953 --> 50:58.323
Ugh.

51:00.258 --> 51:01.592
That's a woman.

51:16.807 --> 51:17.875
What is it?

51:17.942 --> 51:20.378
It's their names.

51:25.216 --> 51:27.452
Trudy Walker.

51:37.027 --> 51:38.163
There's another name here.

51:39.264 --> 51:41.932
Lemuel Washington.

51:41.999 --> 51:44.602
That's my boss at the diner.

51:45.803 --> 51:47.172
[door opens]

51:47.238 --> 51:48.373
Billie Holliday:
* Oh, it's *

51:48.439 --> 51:49.907
* Nobody's fault *

51:49.974 --> 51:51.976
* But mine *

51:52.042 --> 51:57.848
* It's nobody's
fault but mine *

51:57.915 --> 51:59.350
Hey.

52:00.318 --> 52:02.220
I want some meat.

52:02.287 --> 52:06.924
* It's nobody's fault
but mine *

52:06.991 --> 52:08.593
* My mother-- *

52:08.659 --> 52:10.195
Ahem.

52:10.228 --> 52:11.796
What kind of meat
you got back there?

52:11.862 --> 52:14.699
* My mother taught me
how to read *

52:14.765 --> 52:16.667
We got pork chops.

52:16.734 --> 52:18.068
Pork chops?

52:18.203 --> 52:20.405
I thought your people
didn't eat pork chops.

52:20.471 --> 52:22.740
The Koran says don't eat it,

52:22.807 --> 52:24.242
not don't serve it.

52:24.309 --> 52:26.344
Okay, then.

52:26.411 --> 52:29.914
Very well done,
like shoe leather.

52:31.282 --> 52:32.417
And while you're there,

52:32.483 --> 52:35.253
you can think about
why you lied to me.

52:37.054 --> 52:38.823
I didn't lie to you.

52:38.889 --> 52:42.693
You told me you didn't know
what happened to my friend.

52:43.961 --> 52:45.330
I don't.

52:45.396 --> 52:49.434
I suppose you don't know
who this girl is, either?

52:54.104 --> 52:55.473
Ahem.

52:58.443 --> 52:59.977
Yeah. I know her.

53:00.044 --> 53:04.249
I thought maybe you did.

53:04.315 --> 53:06.451
Maybe you saw her
with my friend

53:06.517 --> 53:08.319
and clean forgot about it.

53:08.386 --> 53:11.322
She used to work here.

53:11.389 --> 53:14.392
She served him, I don't know,
a couple of times.

53:14.459 --> 53:16.994
- She worked here.
- Mm-hmm.

53:17.061 --> 53:18.162
Where is she now?

53:18.263 --> 53:19.997
Beats me, man.

53:20.064 --> 53:22.667
She up and ran out of here
this afternoon.

53:24.902 --> 53:29.407
* I know it's nobody's
fault but mine *

53:29.474 --> 53:31.476
You can get
my pork chops now.

53:31.542 --> 53:34.312
* Nobody's fault but mine *

53:34.379 --> 53:36.514
* Oh, good Lord *

53:36.581 --> 53:41.852
* It's nobody's
fault but mine *

53:41.919 --> 53:44.322
[humming]

53:44.389 --> 53:48.293
Hey, Frank,
what are you doing?

53:48.359 --> 53:50.628
What does it look like?
I'm working.

53:53.331 --> 53:54.499
That's, uh,

53:54.565 --> 53:55.966
that's not a replica.

53:59.504 --> 54:00.971
What are you going
to do with that?

54:01.038 --> 54:02.206
Go back to your station.

54:02.307 --> 54:03.374
Buddy.

54:03.441 --> 54:05.776
I said go back
to your station now.

54:05.843 --> 54:11.382
* It's nobody's
fault but mine *

54:11.449 --> 54:15.119
* If I die and I go below *

54:15.185 --> 54:19.924
* It's nobody's
fault but mine *

54:23.328 --> 54:25.796
Who do you think
that woman was?

54:25.863 --> 54:29.400
She must have been
a part of the Resistance.

54:29.467 --> 54:31.436
Probably tortured her
to get those names.

54:31.502 --> 54:33.338
So then Lem's
part of the Resistance.

54:33.371 --> 54:35.540
Yeah, I think he's supposed
to be your contact.

54:35.606 --> 54:37.742
Why didn't he say anything?

54:37.808 --> 54:39.344
I don't--

54:41.045 --> 54:42.347
Ohh.

55:01.231 --> 55:03.000
Get out of the car!
Run now!
