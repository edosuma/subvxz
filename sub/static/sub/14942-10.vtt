00:01.572 --> 00:03.133
(Boy) Here! Throw it!

00:03.134 --> 00:04.134
I'm open!

00:04.135 --> 00:06.076
(Boy) Come on, dude.

(People speaking indistinctly)

00:34.805 --> 00:36.136
What do you think? (Laughs)

00:36.137 --> 00:37.607
Oh, amazing. That is so cute.

00:37.608 --> 00:38.808
Oh, absolutely fierce.

00:38.809 --> 00:39.809
Can I borrow it?

00:39.810 --> 00:41.341
That looks really expensive.

00:41.342 --> 00:45.245
Oh, my god. Um,
lace, is that your mom?

00:45.246 --> 00:47.377
Nice hat.

00:47.378 --> 00:49.579
Can I see it?

00:49.580 --> 00:51.221
Gotta go, lace. Kisses. See ya.

00:51.222 --> 00:52.222
(Computer beeps)

00:52.223 --> 00:53.683
Whoa. Cashmere.

00:53.684 --> 00:56.686
This must have cost a fortune.

00:56.687 --> 00:58.528
It was on sale.

00:58.529 --> 01:00.090
You bought this?

01:00.091 --> 01:01.291
Well, you gave me a credit card.

01:01.292 --> 01:03.463
For emergencies only.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.435
(Chuckles) This was a
total fashion emergency.

01:05.436 --> 01:07.437
And what made you
think this would be okay?

01:07.438 --> 01:09.099
You spend like
this all the time.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.640
Have you seen your shoes?

01:10.641 --> 01:13.503
Hey, I bought these shoes
with the money I earned.

01:13.504 --> 01:14.744
When you start
making your own money,

01:14.745 --> 01:16.106
you can buy whatever you want.

01:16.107 --> 01:17.247
But until then, you
do not spend mine

01:17.248 --> 01:18.848
without asking me permission.

01:18.849 --> 01:21.111
Okay. My bad.

01:21.112 --> 01:23.353
Mistakes were
made. I'll pay for it.

01:23.354 --> 01:25.116
How?

01:26.857 --> 01:29.859
(People speaking indistinctly)

01:29.860 --> 01:32.122
(Sirens whoop)

01:32.123 --> 01:35.525
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

01:35.526 --> 01:37.527
You're looking
chipper this morning.

01:37.528 --> 01:40.200
Well, I'm just high
on life I guess.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.272
Missed a button
there, lover boy.

01:42.273 --> 01:44.274
Oh. How are you doing?

01:44.275 --> 01:46.336
I had to return a hat

01:46.337 --> 01:49.379
that Lacey bought
in society hill for $300

01:49.380 --> 01:50.810
using my credit card.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.183
Oh, 13... the age of independence
and the death of reason.

01:53.184 --> 01:54.644
At least that's what
my sisters went through.

01:54.645 --> 01:56.486
Mm.

01:56.487 --> 01:58.518
Oh, fantastic shoes, doc.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.551
Where'd you get 'em?

02:01.552 --> 02:02.892
Society hill.

02:02.893 --> 02:04.224
(Laughs)

02:04.225 --> 02:05.855
So this is where

02:05.856 --> 02:07.427
the free-for-all
took place, huh?

02:07.428 --> 02:10.430
Yep, courtesy of
apartment 4-0-7.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.602
You missed out. They
picked the street clean.

02:12.603 --> 02:14.404
No one saw the murder, though.

02:14.405 --> 02:16.266
How much cash was tossed?

02:16.267 --> 02:19.269
Ballpark according to
witnesses? Over $50,000.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.710
Whoa.

02:20.711 --> 02:22.843
You'd never guess by this
guy's apartment, though.

02:26.417 --> 02:29.680
(Police radio chatter)

02:31.282 --> 02:33.323
Walter brown...

02:33.324 --> 02:35.455
The tenant of this humble abode.

02:35.456 --> 02:38.288
Lived alone, kept to himself.

02:38.289 --> 02:40.530
Neighbors have no idea
where the money came from.

02:40.531 --> 02:42.562
That's it? That's all you got?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.734
We have no wallet, no
phone, and no murder weapon.

02:44.735 --> 02:47.597
There is a gaping
hole in his torso.

02:47.598 --> 02:50.740
Doctor, I believe that
is your department.

02:50.741 --> 02:52.171
(Sam) No sign of forced entry.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.673
He knew his assailant.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.475
Dented drywall
and a broken glass.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.906
Looks like there was a struggle.

02:56.907 --> 03:00.750
These lacerations
look defensive.

03:00.751 --> 03:02.212
Slit-like wound,

03:02.213 --> 03:03.653
probably from a knife.

03:03.654 --> 03:05.355
As c.S.U. Found no knife,

03:05.356 --> 03:06.886
we're gonna need a
detailed description.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.418
(Siren wails)

03:08.419 --> 03:09.759
(Camera shutter clicking)

03:09.760 --> 03:11.291
Simple guy.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.493
Nothing I'm seeing says
"50 grand out the window."

03:13.494 --> 03:15.395
(Morris) The money
was real. (Click)

03:15.396 --> 03:18.228
Four years college
tuition into thin air.

03:18.229 --> 03:19.769
What cave have
you been living in?

03:19.770 --> 03:21.271
Four years? Try two.

03:21.272 --> 03:22.532
You're kidding me?

03:22.533 --> 03:25.235
Yeah, and that's if
your kid stays in state.

03:25.236 --> 03:27.307
Oh, man.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.279
(Laughs) You know,
maybe the killer

03:29.280 --> 03:31.381
threw the cash out the
window as a diversion

03:31.382 --> 03:33.212
and then escaped
through the mayhem.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.585
(Sam) So Walt steals the money,

03:35.586 --> 03:38.288
killer comes to collect,
Walt pays the price.

03:38.289 --> 03:41.451
Mm. There's a whole
lot of bruising here.

03:41.452 --> 03:44.223
I don't think this was
just about the money.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.727
This was personal.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.799
(Dani) Ready? Go.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.263
(Ethan) Kimberly gleason,
female, 22 years of age.

03:53.264 --> 03:54.864
Attending surgeon, next of kin?

03:54.865 --> 03:56.406
No, no, no, skip that part.

03:56.407 --> 03:58.368
Pathology boards only
care about the case.

03:58.369 --> 03:59.809
Circumstances?

03:59.810 --> 04:02.772
Three days ago,
Kimberly presented to E.R.

04:02.773 --> 04:04.274
With a ruptured appendix.

04:04.275 --> 04:06.616
12 hours after a
routine appendectomy,

04:06.617 --> 04:10.350
she suffered pneumonia
and tachycardia.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.622
It's a fast heart rate.

04:12.623 --> 04:13.623
Mm.

04:13.624 --> 04:15.285
Last night, she crashed.

04:15.286 --> 04:16.756
Cardioversion was unsuccessful.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.329
She was pronounced
dead at 11:35 P.M.

04:19.330 --> 04:21.961
She was beautiful and young.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.733
It's so sad.

04:23.734 --> 04:26.396
Oh, a healthy college kid
dies after a simple operation?

04:26.397 --> 04:28.498
That's not just sad.

04:28.499 --> 04:30.900
That's hinky.

04:30.901 --> 04:32.902
So... how did I do?

04:32.903 --> 04:34.404
Oh, my god. Verbatim.

04:34.405 --> 04:35.405
Yeah?

04:35.406 --> 04:36.646
You're so ready to be drilled.

04:36.647 --> 04:38.047
(Footsteps approach) Yeah.

04:38.048 --> 04:39.909
Oh, good luck. Gotta run.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.312
Thanks.

04:43.053 --> 04:44.914
Dr. Ethan gross,
ready to be drilled.

04:44.915 --> 04:46.916
Yeah, first things first. The
gleason family's coming in.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.459
I want you to talk to them.

04:49.620 --> 04:52.291
Yes. Uh, no problem.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.463
All right,

04:53.464 --> 04:54.924
attending surgeon, next of kin?

04:54.925 --> 04:56.597
What?

04:57.768 --> 05:00.430
(Sighs)

05:00.431 --> 05:01.801
(Camera shutter clicks)

05:01.802 --> 05:03.633
This bruise came from the hilt,

05:03.634 --> 05:05.435
so the blade
went all the way in.

05:05.436 --> 05:07.076
It's distinctive,

05:07.077 --> 05:09.739
so it shouldn't take long to
narrow down the weapon.

05:09.740 --> 05:11.511
Hmm.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.783
You're being unusually helpful.

05:13.784 --> 05:15.645
And you're being
unusually quiet.

05:15.646 --> 05:17.417
Oh, Lacey rocked
Megan's credit card.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.989
Oh, macadangdang.

05:19.990 --> 05:22.492
(Laughs) Thanks
for sharing, Peter.

05:22.493 --> 05:25.525
On your way out, Curtis...

05:25.526 --> 05:28.027
Trace from the arm laceration

05:28.028 --> 05:31.030
and the bruise. Mm-hmm.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.803
Walter brown is a common name,

05:33.804 --> 05:35.805
so employment and
next of kin is still unknown.

05:35.806 --> 05:38.368
He has no prints on file
and no criminal history.

05:38.369 --> 05:40.370
So this guy's
like a blank slate.

05:40.371 --> 05:41.511
Deep calluses...

05:41.512 --> 05:43.342
(Clicks) Burn scars.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.044
(Click) Walt knew
an honest day's work,

05:45.045 --> 05:47.377
unlike certain
prodigal offspring.

05:47.378 --> 05:49.118
(Chuckles)

05:49.119 --> 05:51.881
He's got a manicure,
a full body tan,

05:51.882 --> 05:53.883
and porcelain crowns.

05:53.884 --> 05:56.486
Those things are
like $2,000 each.

05:56.487 --> 05:57.927
Corneal scaring.

05:57.928 --> 06:00.530
He's had Lasik surgery. (Click)

06:00.531 --> 06:02.932
And that...

06:02.933 --> 06:05.364
Looks like a jellyfish sting.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.696
(Click)

06:06.697 --> 06:09.138
Portuguese man-of-war
probably from the Caribbean?

06:09.139 --> 06:10.800
Tanning salons,
expensive elective surgery,

06:10.801 --> 06:12.442
and travel to the tropics.

06:12.443 --> 06:13.673
Who is this guy?

06:13.674 --> 06:15.645
Well, in northern liberties,

06:15.646 --> 06:17.647
with at least 50 grand in cash,

06:17.648 --> 06:19.749
the natives would
call him a criminal.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.751
That looks like a coal tattoo.

06:21.752 --> 06:23.513
It's when coal dust...

06:23.514 --> 06:25.054
(Click) Gets trapped
in an open cut.

06:25.055 --> 06:26.616
There's no active mines around.

06:26.617 --> 06:28.418
But I think there may be
a coal-fired power plant

06:28.419 --> 06:29.659
on the river.

06:29.660 --> 06:32.563
I'll make some phone calls.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.598
(Whistle blows)

06:38.599 --> 06:40.099
Whoa.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.871
(Megan laughs) Oh, my god.

06:41.872 --> 06:43.573
This is what I
call a locker room.

06:43.574 --> 06:44.634
It's a hot tub.

06:44.635 --> 06:46.976
(Men speak indistinctly)

06:46.977 --> 06:49.138
Yeah, that's right.

06:49.139 --> 06:50.580
Can we help you?

06:50.581 --> 06:53.443
Yeah, um, bud
Morris, Philly p.D.

06:53.444 --> 06:54.514
What's going on?

06:54.515 --> 06:57.447
Do any of you
recognize this man?

06:57.448 --> 06:58.788
Walt brown. He's my cousin.

06:58.789 --> 07:00.520
(Man) He's a great guy.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.751
Worked with us for 20 years.

07:01.752 --> 07:03.593
He have any enemies you know of?

07:03.594 --> 07:06.095
No, you must be looking
for a different Walt.

07:06.096 --> 07:09.198
Ours bought
everything you see here.

07:09.199 --> 07:11.561
Wait. Wait a minute.
Walt paid for all this?

07:11.562 --> 07:13.533
Sure. Yeah.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.106
Why do you think
we retired his locker?

07:18.108 --> 07:19.438
Mm.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.071
How exactly did
Walt pay for all this?

07:22.072 --> 07:24.515
You mean, you don't know?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.479
Walt won $50
million in the lottery.

07:31.682 --> 07:33.623
(Chuckles)

07:33.624 --> 07:37.558
(Fabric snaps)

07:43.734 --> 07:45.965
Your cousin walks away
from work a multimillionaire,

07:45.966 --> 07:48.097
and no resentments?

07:48.098 --> 07:49.739
Walt took care of everyone.

07:49.740 --> 07:52.972
He treated his entire
shift to a week in Bermuda.

07:52.973 --> 07:53.973
Hmm.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.975
Every week, I played the lotto.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.578
About eight months
ago, I miss one day.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.680
That same day, Walt,

08:00.681 --> 08:03.052
on a total lark, fills
out the big ticket.

08:03.053 --> 08:05.655
So, yeah, I resented him.

08:05.656 --> 08:07.687
That doesn't mean
I wanted him dead.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.519
Do you know what he was
doing at his old apartment?

08:09.520 --> 08:10.820
Walt loved that place.

08:10.821 --> 08:13.492
We used to have parties
there... Beer and poker.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.225
Later he used it as a refuge.

08:16.226 --> 08:18.568
He could have had enemies.

08:18.569 --> 08:19.869
Well, after he'd won, he
had about 50 cousins show up

08:19.870 --> 08:21.571
he'd never met.

08:21.572 --> 08:23.202
Every one of 'em
had his hand out.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.574
(TV playing indistinctly)

08:24.575 --> 08:26.976
Walt lived a pretty
fast life after he won.

08:26.977 --> 08:29.739
He'd hold huge dinner
parties for his charities...

08:29.740 --> 08:31.541
Nursing home, food banks.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.843
Walt loved making
other people happy.

08:33.844 --> 08:35.885
Of course, some took advantage.

08:35.886 --> 08:37.246
Did you keep up with him?

08:37.247 --> 08:39.719
I tried. It wasn't easy.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.692
At the end of the day,
Walt was a millionaire.

08:42.693 --> 08:46.626
The rest of us had
to go back to work.

08:46.627 --> 08:47.997
Start by alphabetizing these.

08:47.998 --> 08:51.601
No texting, no
wandering the halls.

08:51.602 --> 08:54.033
But... mom, paper kills trees.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.635
You should at least go digital.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.936
Oh, that's a great idea.

08:56.937 --> 09:00.570
Scan them first
and then file them.

09:00.571 --> 09:03.312
This isn't fair. The
punishment doesn't fit the crime.

09:03.313 --> 09:06.175
At 9 bucks an hour,
it'll fit eventually.

09:06.176 --> 09:08.147
See you at 5:00.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.749
There are child labor laws.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.250
Federal code, title 29...

09:11.251 --> 09:13.552
Don't even think
about quoting grandma.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.884
I looked it up myself.

09:14.885 --> 09:16.255
We're not farmers,
and I'm not an actor.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.257
There are radioactive substances
in this building somewhere...

09:18.258 --> 09:21.661
Hey, I do not like this
any more than you do.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.263
The sooner you get
started, the sooner you finish.

09:24.264 --> 09:28.267
(Indistinct conversations)

09:28.268 --> 09:30.270
(Exhales)

09:31.772 --> 09:33.202
Hi. Uh, i'm...

09:33.203 --> 09:35.805
What happened to Kimberly?

09:35.806 --> 09:37.106
Um, well...

09:37.107 --> 09:38.808
We... we don't know yet...

09:38.809 --> 09:40.209
Isn't that why she
was brought here?

09:40.210 --> 09:41.781
Will, please.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.783
They told us she'd get better.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.855
They told us she had pneumonia.

09:45.856 --> 09:47.717
And now my little girl is dead,

09:47.718 --> 09:49.860
and you're telling me
you don't know why?

09:56.827 --> 09:58.167
Uh...

09:58.168 --> 10:00.870
To... to determine cause
of death is a process...

10:00.871 --> 10:03.903
I don't give a damn
about the process.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.336
(Voice breaks) Can't you
give us a straight answer?

10:08.008 --> 10:11.311
Ethan, you're needed in the lab.

10:13.183 --> 10:14.784
Mr. Gleason...

10:14.785 --> 10:16.085
(Voice distorting)
Mrs. Gleason, Maya.

10:16.086 --> 10:18.888
I'm Dr. Kate Murphy. I'm
the chief medical examiner.

10:18.889 --> 10:21.390
We understand
your frustration...

10:21.391 --> 10:23.022
Hey, you.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.295
Afternoon, Alvarez.

10:26.797 --> 10:28.898
We're looking for a razor-sharp,

10:28.899 --> 10:31.160
single-edge knife,
probably cutlery,

10:31.161 --> 10:33.162
and all the blood
from the fallen cash

10:33.163 --> 10:35.965
that we managed to
recover matches Walt's.

10:35.966 --> 10:37.837
So Walt threw out his own money?

10:37.838 --> 10:40.710
The rich aren't like you
and me, Megan. Well, me.

10:40.711 --> 10:42.872
You know, they throw
cash around like it's confetti.

10:42.873 --> 10:45.975
They spend $300 on a hat.

10:45.976 --> 10:47.877
That's why Lacey's here, right?

10:47.878 --> 10:50.149
Hey, I'm new at this
teenage discipline stuff.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.951
You got any pearls of wisdom?

10:51.952 --> 10:53.282
Not a one.

10:53.283 --> 10:54.824
What do you got?

10:54.825 --> 10:55.925
Well, Walt was an enigma.

10:55.926 --> 10:57.727
He seemed to be
enjoying himself.

10:57.728 --> 11:00.990
Those abrasions on his
back are fingernail marks.

11:00.991 --> 11:02.992
And somebody was enjoying Walt.

11:02.993 --> 11:04.663
Or pretending to.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.897
And his fatty liver
indicates a lot of drinking.

11:07.898 --> 11:09.298
Amen to that.

11:09.299 --> 11:12.101
Stomach contents show
a whole lot of red wine,

11:12.102 --> 11:14.844
plus aged stilton
cheese, caviar,

11:14.845 --> 11:17.006
beef carpaccio,
and apple baklava,

11:17.007 --> 11:19.008
well within an
hour of his death.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.380
Huh. You're Mr. Foodie.
Any idea where he ate all that?

11:21.381 --> 11:24.053
(Chuckles) Oh, no. Way
above my price range.

11:24.054 --> 11:25.885
Maybe Lacey knows.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.857
(Peter laughs)

11:27.858 --> 11:29.719
So an instant millionaire
is enjoying life to the hilt.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.020
What's the riddle, huh?

11:31.021 --> 11:32.291
Walt's big heart.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.993
Well, maybe he was generous.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.325
As in 500 grams big.

11:36.326 --> 11:38.267
Whoa. That is a big heart.

11:38.268 --> 11:39.899
Way above average.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.070
So nodular kidneys

11:41.071 --> 11:42.872
and hemorrhagic
lesions on his adrenals

11:42.873 --> 11:45.234
indicate high blood pressure.

11:45.235 --> 11:46.936
Grinding his teeth
and gastric ulcers

11:46.937 --> 11:48.237
point to high anxiety.

11:48.238 --> 11:50.239
If Walt was having
such a good time,

11:50.240 --> 11:52.742
what was he so stressed about?

11:52.743 --> 11:54.043
(Clicking keyboard key rapidly)

11:54.044 --> 11:55.114
Oh!

11:55.115 --> 11:56.215
How's the father-to-be
holding up?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.947
I am armed, you know?

11:57.948 --> 11:59.348
(Laughs)

11:59.349 --> 12:01.921
Well, the fellas and I have
some surprises for you. Bell.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.793
First the address of
a gladwyne mansion

12:03.794 --> 12:04.994
under Walt's name.

12:04.995 --> 12:06.996
He used to rent it
out for charity events.

12:06.997 --> 12:08.327
Lopez.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.000
The d.N.A. From Walt's
cut... A cow from Japan.

12:11.001 --> 12:12.131
Kobe beef.

12:12.132 --> 12:15.034
Identical to the meat
found in his stomach.

12:15.035 --> 12:18.007
So whoever cut Walt
prepared his last meal.

12:18.008 --> 12:20.169
Mm-hmm. And Walt
was big into cooking,

12:20.170 --> 12:22.942
celebrity chef
lessons to be exact.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.944
There's one scheduled
at the mansion today.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.817
I'll head out there right now.

12:27.818 --> 12:29.448
Uh...

12:29.449 --> 12:32.181
(Indistinct conversations)

12:32.182 --> 12:33.953
One more thing.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.985
What's this?

12:35.986 --> 12:38.958
(Exhales deeply)

12:38.959 --> 12:41.290
Oh, come on. Don't be like that.

12:41.291 --> 12:43.362
Dare to dream. You
never know. Look at Walt.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.064
You mean the dead guy?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.936
(Sighs) The one with
the knife in his torso?

12:46.937 --> 12:47.937
(Chuckles)

12:47.938 --> 12:49.268
This is what I'm reduced to?

12:49.269 --> 12:52.802
It... it's just a pipe
dream. It's an addiction.

12:52.803 --> 12:54.904
What's going on, bud?

12:54.905 --> 12:56.846
(Sighs)

12:56.847 --> 12:58.948
When my kid is 18,

12:58.949 --> 13:01.310
I'm gonna be 66 years old.

13:01.311 --> 13:03.352
And the pension that I have

13:03.353 --> 13:06.785
won't even cover a cap and gown.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.358
You have 18 amazing
years of parenting

13:09.359 --> 13:12.361
to worry about first.

13:12.362 --> 13:14.423
You're gonna be okay.

13:14.424 --> 13:16.026
(Pats back)

13:17.267 --> 13:19.870
(Blows air)

13:21.101 --> 13:23.032
Uh, lungs are a lot worse off

13:23.033 --> 13:25.034
than radiology indicated.

13:25.035 --> 13:27.006
Uh, there's... there's
multilobar, infiltrates,

13:27.007 --> 13:29.839
and, uh, alveolar
hemorrhaging and...

13:29.840 --> 13:31.240
(People speaking indistinctly)

13:31.241 --> 13:32.982
I'm sorry.

13:32.983 --> 13:34.483
I panicked,

13:34.484 --> 13:37.146
and people and...
and their emotion...

13:37.147 --> 13:38.487
Ethan, what happened is okay.

13:38.488 --> 13:40.219
It's my fault for putting
you in that situation.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.921
You weren't ready.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.152
Got it.

13:43.153 --> 13:45.254
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

13:45.255 --> 13:47.096
Necrotizing pneumonia?

13:47.097 --> 13:49.058
How did that get
missed in intensive care?

13:49.059 --> 13:50.429
It's weird, right?

13:50.430 --> 13:51.961
Yeah. I'll pay a
visit to the hospital

13:51.962 --> 13:53.062
first thing tomorrow morning.

13:53.063 --> 13:56.005
(Sighs deeply)

13:56.006 --> 13:57.566
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

13:57.567 --> 14:00.169
Be ready at 7:30 sharp.

14:00.170 --> 14:03.343
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

14:04.514 --> 14:07.016
♪♪♪

14:07.017 --> 14:10.179
(Indistinct conversations)

14:10.180 --> 14:12.321
Are you here for the
Leon gould experience?

14:12.322 --> 14:14.083
The cooking lesson?

14:14.084 --> 14:16.085
Justine. Walt's event planner.

14:16.086 --> 14:18.027
Oh, Peter, a friend of Walt's.

14:18.028 --> 14:19.358
Oh. Have you seen him?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.160
I have been looking
all over for him.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.591
Not for a little while.

14:22.592 --> 14:24.593
He throws quite a party, though.

14:24.594 --> 14:27.366
Well, when Walt gets into
something, he gets into it.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.497
Mm.

14:28.498 --> 14:30.039
Next week he wants an
18th-century masquerade

14:30.040 --> 14:33.202
and then a Hawaiian
luau with suckling pig.

14:33.203 --> 14:34.543
He sounds a little manic.

14:34.544 --> 14:36.145
You have no idea. (Chuckles)

14:36.146 --> 14:38.147
And what is today's theme?

14:38.148 --> 14:41.880
A taste of Italy... Comfort
food and knife skills.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.082
Right this way.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.915
(Whooshes) (Woman) Ohh!

14:46.086 --> 14:48.157
Well, welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

14:48.158 --> 14:52.061
Today's lesson is all about
northern Italian cuisine.

14:52.062 --> 14:53.222
And in northern Italian cuisine,

14:53.223 --> 14:57.196
there is lots of fresh
vegetables that need to be

14:57.197 --> 15:00.499
sliced and diced.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.171
(Scrapes knife against board)

15:02.172 --> 15:04.373
Now I'm gonna need a
couple of volunteers to help me.

15:04.374 --> 15:06.235
Young lady,

15:06.236 --> 15:09.378
young man, come up here.

15:09.379 --> 15:11.480
So we're actually gonna
make a pan-seared snapper,

15:11.481 --> 15:13.912
with a potato and apple hash

15:13.913 --> 15:16.145
and some fresh zucchini...

15:16.146 --> 15:18.247
Very light, very simple.

15:18.248 --> 15:20.249
Sir, uh, your
station's over here.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.651
Actually, uh, my
station is downtown.

15:22.652 --> 15:23.922
(People murmuring indistinctly)

15:23.923 --> 15:25.324
What's going on?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.626
We're investigating the
murder of Walter brown.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.628
Murder? Mm. He was killed

15:29.629 --> 15:32.561
with a single-edged
Japanese chef's knife,

15:32.562 --> 15:33.932
kinda sorta...

15:33.933 --> 15:35.104
Yeah.

15:35.105 --> 15:37.036
Exactly like this one.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.239
(Murmuring continues)

15:49.349 --> 15:51.220
It's easy to clean these knives.

15:51.221 --> 15:52.721
It's a little harder
to sterilize them.

15:52.722 --> 15:54.553
In the hilt of this
particular knife,

15:54.554 --> 15:57.186
we found traces of Kobe beef.

15:57.187 --> 15:58.357
It's actually wagyu beef.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.059
You see, the cattle...

16:00.060 --> 16:02.231
It's the same beef Walt
ate an hour before he died...

16:02.232 --> 16:03.963
Your dish, Leon.

16:05.495 --> 16:08.197
It's the same beef found
in this cut in his arm,

16:08.198 --> 16:09.698
from your blade, Leon.

16:09.699 --> 16:12.101
I do this knife flip.

16:12.102 --> 16:14.543
Walt tried it. He cut himself.

16:14.544 --> 16:17.106
So I give him a knife to
take home and practice with.

16:17.107 --> 16:19.248
How funny we didn't
find one at his home.

16:19.249 --> 16:22.451
Witnesses say you left
yesterday's party early.

16:22.452 --> 16:25.114
Yes, I did, to look for Walt.

16:25.115 --> 16:27.116
He said somebody was
trying to crash the party

16:27.117 --> 16:29.288
and he was gonna go
outside and deal with it.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.460
Do you have any
idea who was outside?

16:31.461 --> 16:32.561
No.

16:32.562 --> 16:34.223
But I was worried.

16:34.224 --> 16:36.165
Walt was in a bad temper,

16:36.166 --> 16:37.367
and it wasn't like him.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.230
Hmm.

16:47.237 --> 16:48.237
(Knock on door)

16:48.238 --> 16:49.438
(Peter) Morning.

16:49.439 --> 16:51.140
I saw Lacey heading
out to scan some files.

16:51.141 --> 16:52.411
She looks like a trooper.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.243
She hates me.

16:54.244 --> 16:55.714
Enlightenment takes a while.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.486
Define "a while."

16:57.487 --> 17:00.689
My sisters ran roughshod
over my mom for decades.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.551
(Chuckles) Oh,
that's so comforting.

17:02.552 --> 17:04.223
(Inhales deeply)

17:04.224 --> 17:07.496
Cause of death
is lacerated aorta.

17:07.497 --> 17:09.658
Walt bled out in minutes.

17:09.659 --> 17:12.601
Letters and invoices
from the last month alone...

17:12.602 --> 17:14.303
Walt's staff overcharged him,

17:14.304 --> 17:16.305
distant relatives
asked for handouts.

17:16.306 --> 17:18.667
You know, any one of them
could've been the party crasher.

17:18.668 --> 17:20.669
Leon said that Walt
left the party angry.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.641
His body said that
he was anxious.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.143
Justine said he was manic.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.815
I mean, do you think his
death is related to his behavior?

17:26.816 --> 17:28.317
Here as always

17:28.318 --> 17:30.179
to answer such timely questions

17:30.180 --> 17:32.221
is Dr. Curtis brumfield.

17:32.222 --> 17:33.822
(Chuckles)

17:33.823 --> 17:36.325
Trace came back
off the chest bruises.

17:36.326 --> 17:38.227
Magnesium oxide.

17:38.228 --> 17:40.289
That sounds like
the power plant.

17:40.290 --> 17:41.630
Colin certainly had motive.

17:41.631 --> 17:43.532
Yeah, maybe, but magnesium oxide

17:43.533 --> 17:45.434
is a byproduct of
tungsten welding.

17:45.435 --> 17:47.696
Ooh. Impressed?

17:47.697 --> 17:49.698
(Curtis chuckles) I got a list
of toxins from the supervisor.

17:49.699 --> 17:53.442
I believe that Dave
had a welding visor on.

17:53.443 --> 17:54.643
I'll get his address.

17:54.644 --> 17:57.407
Uh, this was waiting
for you at reception.

18:01.851 --> 18:04.854
(People speaking indistinctly)

18:06.216 --> 18:08.117
(Woman cries)

18:08.118 --> 18:10.259
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

18:10.260 --> 18:13.422
Are you okay?

18:13.423 --> 18:17.127
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

18:30.880 --> 18:34.243
(Voice breaking) My sister died.

18:34.244 --> 18:37.216
Dad's furious at everyone.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.747
He wants answers.

18:38.748 --> 18:41.620
The doctors don't care.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.423
They don't listen.

18:47.297 --> 18:49.399
I promise you, they do.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.762
My mom's one of them.

18:54.364 --> 18:57.836
I had a necklace
with a picture of her.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.809
We can't find it.

19:01.441 --> 19:04.244
I thought it might be here.

19:06.816 --> 19:09.278
(Cries)

19:09.279 --> 19:11.880
(Ethan) So you checked
Kimberly's hep-locks yourself?

19:11.881 --> 19:14.383
My nurses do the hep-locks.
(Women speaking indistinctly)

19:14.384 --> 19:15.454
Look, I know you mean well,

19:15.455 --> 19:17.326
but these are not really
the most important questions

19:17.327 --> 19:18.487
for you to ask.

19:18.488 --> 19:19.828
See the charts.
(Speaking indistinctly)

19:19.829 --> 19:21.930
Are... are you
questioning my judgment?

19:21.931 --> 19:23.492
No, just your, uh, experience.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.264
(Kate speaking
indistinctly) (Exhales)

19:25.265 --> 19:27.396
When was sepsis
first discovered?

19:27.397 --> 19:28.437
My head nurse reported it...

19:28.438 --> 19:30.569
I'm not asking the head nurse.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.201
12 hours post-op.

19:32.202 --> 19:33.472
Appendectomy complication rate?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.274
Less than 6% at her age.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.405
So a complication was possible?

19:36.406 --> 19:37.406
Unlikely.

19:37.407 --> 19:38.747
Look, here's what I know...

19:38.748 --> 19:41.350
Her appendix ruptured,
she went septic,

19:41.351 --> 19:42.411
we gave broad-spectrum
antibiotics,

19:42.412 --> 19:43.612
and they failed.

19:43.613 --> 19:46.515
Kimberly gleason was
given impeccable care.

19:46.516 --> 19:48.757
Okay, well, here's
what I know...

19:48.758 --> 19:50.759
Your dead patient
is now our case,

19:50.760 --> 19:52.221
and I need you
to... (Kate) Doctor.

19:52.222 --> 19:53.322
Yeah?

19:53.323 --> 19:55.424
May I have a moment?
Excuse us, please.

19:55.425 --> 19:56.925
Can you fill this
out at the lab?

19:56.926 --> 19:59.197
It's for Kimberly's cultures.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.371
Wait. Am I done with...
Am I done with Faber?

20:02.372 --> 20:04.433
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

20:04.434 --> 20:05.774
(Lowered voice) It's
a dialogue, Ethan,

20:05.775 --> 20:07.336
not an inquisition.

20:07.337 --> 20:09.438
I'll take it from here.

20:09.439 --> 20:11.440
Excuse me. Got a
bit tense back there.

20:11.441 --> 20:12.412
(Exhales deeply) He's...

20:12.413 --> 20:13.842
(Taps clipboard)

20:13.843 --> 20:15.844
You gotta make sure
you keep it out of the trees.

20:15.845 --> 20:16.845
(Sam) Mr. Stackhouse?

20:16.846 --> 20:19.388
Hello.

20:19.389 --> 20:21.350
So what brings you down here?

20:21.351 --> 20:22.491
(Sighs)

20:22.492 --> 20:25.694
We found magnesium
oxide on Walt's bruises.

20:25.695 --> 20:27.396
(Woman speaks indistinctly)

20:27.397 --> 20:29.959
Uh, hey, could you...

20:34.964 --> 20:38.467
I believe that's a substance
you're familiar with.

20:38.468 --> 20:41.510
Something you want
to share with us, Dave?

20:41.511 --> 20:42.711
(Boy laughs)

20:42.712 --> 20:44.473
Walt meant the world to us.

20:44.474 --> 20:45.445
(Boy) Look!

20:45.446 --> 20:47.346
He was an uncle to my son.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.519
That swing set
was a gift from him.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.650
Mm.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.652
Everybody said he was
generous with his winnings.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.924
No, that came last
year, before the money.

20:55.925 --> 20:58.387
He could barely afford it.

20:58.388 --> 21:00.559
After the money,
everything changed.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.891
He stopped visiting,
returning phone calls.

21:02.892 --> 21:05.394
When we did talk, he couldn't
wait to get off the phone.

21:05.395 --> 21:07.436
It was like he was
giving up on us.

21:07.437 --> 21:09.038
Is that what the
fight was about?

21:10.340 --> 21:11.340
(Boy laughs)

21:11.341 --> 21:12.901
Walt...

21:12.902 --> 21:16.044
Never missed Cal's
birthday his whole life,

21:16.045 --> 21:17.846
until yesterday.

21:17.847 --> 21:19.478
(Cal) Wee!

21:19.479 --> 21:21.850
He broke my son's heart.

21:21.851 --> 21:24.713
I was furious, so I
drove over to his mansion

21:24.714 --> 21:26.815
only to find a
bunch of strangers

21:26.816 --> 21:30.419
who would never look twice
at Walt before the money.

21:30.420 --> 21:33.662
He forgot about the
people who cared about him.

21:33.663 --> 21:36.395
It got heated.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.926
Then he drove off on his bike.

21:37.927 --> 21:39.428
He had a motorcycle?

21:39.429 --> 21:40.929
Custom made.

21:40.930 --> 21:42.931
The first thing he
bought after he won.

21:42.932 --> 21:45.073
There's no record
of a bike like that.

21:45.074 --> 21:47.437
I'm gonna put out an a.P.B.

21:51.411 --> 21:54.483
I knew Walt better than anyone.

21:54.484 --> 21:56.615
Never thought money
would change him.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.818
I was wrong.

22:01.521 --> 22:05.394
(Indistinct conversations)

22:05.395 --> 22:06.555
Hi.

22:06.556 --> 22:08.427
Good afternoon, al... whoa!

22:08.428 --> 22:10.459
You "Alvarez" me again,

22:10.460 --> 22:12.501
I will kick you bowlegged.

22:12.502 --> 22:14.062
Why are you being so weird?

22:14.063 --> 22:15.564
Dani, we're at work.

22:15.565 --> 22:17.536
It doesn't have to
be this awkward.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.538
Hey, I'm Dani.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.840
Nice to meet you.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.942
Maybe I'll see you at 6:00?

22:23.943 --> 22:26.815
Here-ish?

22:26.816 --> 22:28.717
(Laughs)

22:28.718 --> 22:31.520
(Peter) Why are you
looking at Walt's brain?

22:31.521 --> 22:34.453
According to Dave, Walt's
behavior became erratic

22:34.454 --> 22:36.825
after he won the lottery.

22:36.826 --> 22:40.429
He became manic,
paranoid, and impulsive.

22:40.430 --> 22:42.431
Is it possible that you
don't want to admit

22:42.432 --> 22:44.864
that money can change
someone completely?

22:46.466 --> 22:48.567
(Laughs)

22:48.568 --> 22:52.471
Yes, I am worried
that Lacey is changing.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.473
But it is not a medical mystery.

22:54.474 --> 22:58.447
It's called teenage rebellion.

22:58.448 --> 23:00.509
What was his last meal again?

23:00.510 --> 23:02.751
Uh, red wine, stilton cheese,

23:02.752 --> 23:04.553
caviar, Kobe...

23:04.554 --> 23:06.585
Tyramine.yes.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.458
They all contain tyramine.

23:09.619 --> 23:11.620
It's not in his brain at all.

23:11.621 --> 23:13.862
It's in his kidneys.

23:13.863 --> 23:15.964
Ha ha!

23:15.965 --> 23:18.697
Yes, ye of little faith.

23:18.698 --> 23:22.070
That is an enormous nucleus,

23:22.071 --> 23:24.874
which could mean only one thing.

23:26.536 --> 23:28.437
Ah. A pheo.

23:28.438 --> 23:29.438
A what?

23:29.439 --> 23:30.609
A pheochromocytoma.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.542
Walt had a tumor
on his adrenal gland,

23:33.543 --> 23:36.044
causing his system
to flood with hormones

23:36.045 --> 23:37.546
and his blood pressure spiked,

23:37.547 --> 23:39.488
making his moods erratic.

23:39.489 --> 23:41.720
Oh, so Walt became a teenager.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.051
Yes, basically,

23:43.052 --> 23:45.854
and the tyramine in
his diet did not help.

23:45.855 --> 23:47.425
So when do you
think it all started?

23:47.426 --> 23:50.128
By the size of that tumor,
I'd say over a year ago.

23:50.129 --> 23:53.562
Long before he
bought the lottery ticket.

23:53.563 --> 23:56.665
So Walt did not change
because of the money.

23:56.666 --> 23:59.708
He changed because he was sick.

23:59.709 --> 24:02.742
And none of his friends
recognized the difference.

24:04.814 --> 24:08.547
(Siren wailing)

24:08.548 --> 24:12.020
(Engine revving)

24:12.021 --> 24:13.552
(Wailing continues)

24:13.553 --> 24:16.655
(Tires squeal)

24:16.656 --> 24:19.729
(Wailing continues)

24:23.693 --> 24:27.066
(Police radio chatter)

24:28.568 --> 24:30.570
Turn it off and
take off your helmet.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.203
(Turns off engine)

24:38.708 --> 24:40.580
What's your hurry, sweetheart?

24:50.760 --> 24:53.121
Walt gave me the bike. I swear.

24:53.122 --> 24:55.794
Unfortunately, Walt's
not here to confirm that.

24:55.795 --> 24:58.226
How long had you
two been together?

24:58.227 --> 25:00.669
Do I need to

25:00.670 --> 25:03.973
measure your fingernails?

25:07.537 --> 25:09.177
Just over two months.

25:09.178 --> 25:12.611
He was opening a nursing
home in northern liberties.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.042
I was writing a local piece.

25:14.043 --> 25:15.544
We've been together ever since.

25:15.545 --> 25:18.046
How touching and
profitable for you.

25:18.047 --> 25:20.118
Look, I loved Walt.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.790
He was kind, thoughtful.

25:21.791 --> 25:24.222
He was also manic and anxious.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.824
That was all the charity work.

25:25.825 --> 25:28.296
Walt made it a full-time job.

25:28.297 --> 25:29.628
Or it was the endocrine tumor

25:29.629 --> 25:32.100
that had been affecting
his behavior for months.

25:32.101 --> 25:34.934
Why did you run
away from my siren?

25:36.105 --> 25:37.165
I panicked.

25:37.166 --> 25:38.907
I-I have been questioned

25:38.908 --> 25:40.769
about stealing
from a client before,

25:40.770 --> 25:42.641
but it... it was a total
misunderstanding.

25:42.642 --> 25:43.972
Like this one?

25:43.973 --> 25:45.274
Yes.

25:47.877 --> 25:49.918
So am I in the clear?

25:49.919 --> 25:52.121
(Chuckles) Hardly.

25:59.729 --> 26:01.229
More?

26:01.230 --> 26:04.062
You'll be saving a whole rain
forest by the time you done.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.994
No, no. She can't do this to me.

26:05.995 --> 26:07.295
I have a life.

26:07.296 --> 26:08.937
My friends are out
of school this week,

26:08.938 --> 26:10.198
and they're talking about boys.

26:10.199 --> 26:12.941
I... I'm missing
out on my youth.

26:12.942 --> 26:14.242
Here you go.

26:14.243 --> 26:16.144
(Ethan) Go ahead. Open it.

26:16.145 --> 26:18.977
(People speaking indistinctly)

26:18.978 --> 26:22.712
You are cordially
invited to the break room.

26:32.161 --> 26:34.292
Sorry. After you.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.324
No.

26:36.325 --> 26:37.996
Why don't we share?

26:37.997 --> 26:39.197
(People speaking indistinctly)

26:39.198 --> 26:41.770
Oh, yeah. We could share it.

26:41.771 --> 26:44.102
Yeah.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.905
There you go.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.837
Enjoy.

26:48.838 --> 26:50.979
Thank you.

26:50.980 --> 26:52.081
Mm-hmm.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.344
You should be
using cloth napkins.

26:56.345 --> 26:58.287
Yeah, you should.

26:59.789 --> 27:01.049
(Chuckles)

27:01.050 --> 27:02.620
I don't know how you
guys do this every day.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.292
I know we should
say something wise,

27:04.293 --> 27:06.394
but sometimes,
work is just work.

27:06.395 --> 27:07.395
(Cell phone rings)

27:07.396 --> 27:08.396
(Ring)

27:08.397 --> 27:09.728
See?

27:09.729 --> 27:11.359
Sorry, Lacey.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.861
(Mouth full) Look at that.

27:12.862 --> 27:15.003
All it is is paperwork. (Grunts)

27:15.004 --> 27:16.634
No, it's not just paperwork.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.768
It's being able to talk to
somebody who needs your help.

27:19.769 --> 27:21.810
See, this is what I suck at.

27:21.811 --> 27:24.943
Seriously. I was... i was talking
to this family the other day,

27:24.944 --> 27:27.375
they just lost a
daughter, and I'm s...

27:27.376 --> 27:29.317
The gleasons? That was you?

27:29.318 --> 27:31.319
Yeah. Why?

27:31.320 --> 27:33.321
I talked to their daughter
Maya. She was really upset.

27:33.322 --> 27:36.254
She feels like...
Like nobody cares.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.256
Of course I care.

27:38.257 --> 27:41.329
Look, they wanted an
answer that I didn't have,

27:41.330 --> 27:43.832
that I still don't have.

27:43.833 --> 27:45.964
You'll find a way to help.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.165
(Cell phone rings)

27:47.166 --> 27:49.267
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

27:49.268 --> 27:51.971
I-I-I gotta go. G...

27:57.006 --> 27:58.676
Second body, same O.R.?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.949
Luisa Hernandez, 55.

28:00.950 --> 28:03.311
Hip surgery four days ago.

28:03.312 --> 28:06.354
Coded last night with
cardiovascular collapse.

28:06.355 --> 28:07.856
Is this hinky, too?

28:07.857 --> 28:09.789
Uh, yeah, this is very hinky.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.195
Mottled skin,

28:17.196 --> 28:18.867
bloody sputum.

28:18.868 --> 28:20.428
It looks like septicemia.

28:20.429 --> 28:23.171
(Scoffs) Bacteria run
amok in the blood stream.

28:23.172 --> 28:25.003
It's nasty stuff.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.305
Kimberly had it, too.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.437
Okay, this is not good.

28:29.438 --> 28:32.110
I mean, what if the hospital
missed something huge?

28:32.111 --> 28:33.882
Well, you'll have to go back.

28:33.883 --> 28:35.383
Yeah, I-I don't think anybody's

28:35.384 --> 28:37.045
gonna let me talk to
the living for a while.

28:37.046 --> 28:39.318
So do what you do
best. Talk to the dead.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.392
(Chuckles)

28:46.325 --> 28:48.026
Come with me.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.357
Um...

28:49.358 --> 28:51.059
I have another assignment.

28:51.060 --> 28:52.060
(Sucks teeth)

28:52.061 --> 28:54.362
Uh...

28:54.363 --> 28:56.404
Next time.

28:56.405 --> 28:59.437
(Sighs) Okay, it's
just you and me, lady.

28:59.438 --> 29:02.241
(Groans)

29:07.176 --> 29:09.347
Ooh. I got it.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.419
Hey, give that to me, please.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.822
What's this...
Families reconnected?

29:13.823 --> 29:16.154
Yeah, it's not important. Okay?

29:16.155 --> 29:17.325
No, don't open it.

29:17.326 --> 29:19.828
What's in it?

29:19.829 --> 29:22.060
It's the name of
my birth parents.

29:22.061 --> 29:25.163
Why don't you want to open it?

29:25.164 --> 29:27.495
I'm gonna go check in on Megan.

29:27.496 --> 29:30.168
(Footsteps recede)

29:30.169 --> 29:34.142
(Indistinct conversations)

29:34.143 --> 29:35.804
Hey.

29:35.805 --> 29:38.146
Turns out the knife went
all the way to the vertebra,

29:38.147 --> 29:41.850
leaving a 2-centimeter
defect in the bone.

29:41.851 --> 29:43.211
Hello?

29:43.212 --> 29:44.482
Yeah, I'm listening.

29:44.483 --> 29:46.985
Uh, whoever killed
Walt used a lot of force.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.887
Yeah, but that's
not all. Look at this.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.088
(Clicks mouse)

29:50.089 --> 29:53.061
See that tiny metal tip
embedded in the bone?

29:53.062 --> 29:54.863
So the knife got
stuck in the spine.

29:54.864 --> 29:56.364
Could we get the tip?

29:56.365 --> 29:57.996
Mm. We'd have to decalcify.

29:57.997 --> 29:59.527
It would take days.

29:59.528 --> 30:01.369
I think there's something else.

30:01.370 --> 30:02.500
Megan, we... (chuckles)
We've looked at the abdomen,

30:02.501 --> 30:04.502
like, a hundred times.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.034
(Clicking mouse) All right.
All right. Let's look at the legs.

30:06.035 --> 30:08.236
Oh, of course.
Silly me. The legs.

30:08.237 --> 30:10.038
(Continues clicking)

30:10.039 --> 30:12.440
Look at that.

30:12.441 --> 30:14.542
That's just the zipper
from the body bag.

30:14.543 --> 30:17.215
No, not the zipper.

30:17.216 --> 30:18.948
Look what's behind it.

30:21.190 --> 30:24.423
Get me a lateral image of
that. Meet me in the morgue.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.499
Mom, it's almost 8:00.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.431
Not done yet. Ten more minutes.

30:33.432 --> 30:34.602
We found something else.

30:34.603 --> 30:36.104
You already know
what killed him.

30:36.105 --> 30:38.106
Lacey, this man was very sick,

30:38.107 --> 30:40.408
and not even his
closest friends knew it.

30:40.409 --> 30:41.569
(Keyboard keys clicking)

30:41.570 --> 30:44.542
What happens when
there are no answers?

30:44.543 --> 30:46.314
What do you tell people then?

30:46.315 --> 30:49.117
Sometimes even the
answers don't help.

30:49.118 --> 30:52.550
Ultimately, it's about
giving comfort to the living...

30:52.551 --> 30:55.124
Any way we can.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.590
How'd the knife
fragment get in his thigh?

31:02.591 --> 31:04.462
It was carried

31:04.463 --> 31:05.964
down the aorta

31:05.965 --> 31:09.137
and then lodged right here

31:09.138 --> 31:11.369
in the femoral artery,

31:11.370 --> 31:13.972
and voila.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.574
The murder weapon.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.477
Even better...
It's got trace on it.

31:19.478 --> 31:20.979
Dr. Murphy,

31:20.980 --> 31:24.312
Kimberly had pneumonia
and septicemia.

31:24.313 --> 31:26.354
So did luisa. And
check this out.

31:26.355 --> 31:29.557
She also had red
hepatization of the lungs.

31:29.558 --> 31:31.490
It looks like a liver.

31:33.162 --> 31:34.662
Luisa has it, too.

31:34.663 --> 31:36.664
(People speaking indistinctly)

31:36.665 --> 31:39.027
Which means there's
an infection in the O.R.

31:39.028 --> 31:41.430
The whole hospital
could be at risk.

31:50.179 --> 31:52.280
(Kate) Two patients
under your care

31:52.281 --> 31:53.581
died with identical symptoms.

31:53.582 --> 31:55.113
Somewhere, someone screwed up.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.444
(Sighs) Do you think
we overlook hygiene?

31:56.445 --> 31:58.146
Well, I think you
overlooked something.

31:58.147 --> 32:00.989
Let's go over the symptoms
of both cases, last to first.

32:00.990 --> 32:03.251
V-fib, before that... (Exhales)

32:03.252 --> 32:06.024
Tachy, pneumonia, fever...

32:06.025 --> 32:07.025
Nosebleeds.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.526
Ethan, now is not the time.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.528
No, they were both
nasally intubated in the field.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.030
They both had nosebleeds.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.501
My staff knows
how to reintubate.

32:13.502 --> 32:15.503
That's exactly
what makes it weird.

32:15.504 --> 32:17.035
They wouldn't
have bled normally.

32:17.036 --> 32:20.438
Maybe... maybe the infection
started in the nasal passages.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.510
(People speak indistinctly)

32:22.511 --> 32:23.941
Doctor, where are you taking us?

32:23.942 --> 32:25.443
If the nasal passages
were the first to be infected,

32:25.444 --> 32:26.944
we need to get to the E.R.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.276
I was right?

32:28.277 --> 32:29.478
(Man) Coming through. Look out!

32:31.020 --> 32:35.283
(Gurney wheels clatter)

32:35.284 --> 32:37.055
Boating accident.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.226
Hypothermic.

32:38.227 --> 32:40.388
Hypotensive. O-2
sats down to 83.

32:40.389 --> 32:43.131
Okay, let's ventilate.

32:43.132 --> 32:45.163
(Indistinct conversations)

32:45.164 --> 32:48.237
Take the bag on the far right.

32:49.498 --> 32:52.541
(Woman speaks
indistinctly over P.A.)

32:55.304 --> 32:57.545
That's contaminated.

32:57.546 --> 32:58.706
This filter needed
to be changed.

32:58.707 --> 33:00.708
The ventilation bags are
hanging right by a wall light,

33:00.709 --> 33:02.710
giving bacteria a
perfect place to thrive.

33:02.711 --> 33:04.512
Your nurses have
been infecting patients

33:04.513 --> 33:06.584
as they come through the door.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.087
Doctor, I had no idea...

33:09.088 --> 33:10.458
No.

33:10.459 --> 33:11.759
I take full responsibility.

33:11.760 --> 33:13.561
It's my patient. It's my watch.

33:13.562 --> 33:18.266
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

33:18.267 --> 33:19.597
That took guts.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.169
I've been there.

33:21.170 --> 33:22.470
Have you?

33:22.471 --> 33:25.103
Two people are dead.

33:25.104 --> 33:27.435
Who knows how many
lives you just saved?

33:27.436 --> 33:29.207
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

33:29.208 --> 33:31.279
In my field, the hardest thing

33:31.280 --> 33:34.112
is explaining to a family
why you were wrong

33:34.113 --> 33:36.484
after it's too late to
do anything about it.

33:36.485 --> 33:39.787
All you can do is
admit it and move on.

33:39.788 --> 33:42.520
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

33:42.521 --> 33:44.592
Thank you.

33:44.593 --> 33:46.555
It's my job.

33:49.798 --> 33:52.260
(Mouth full) You should be
using a cloth napkin, you know?

33:52.261 --> 33:53.631
Save the environment.

33:53.632 --> 33:56.664
Has Lacey been talking
to you instead of working?

33:56.665 --> 33:59.507
Lacey's a smart girl
with a good heart.

33:59.508 --> 34:01.239
Give her room, Megan.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.612
She'll get there, just not
on your timetab... ouch!

34:04.613 --> 34:06.744
I'm trying to figure out
how the knife thrust worked.

34:06.745 --> 34:10.047
The killer held it
with the knife edgeup.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.580
Ouch. Do I look like a
Thanksgiving Turkey to you?

34:12.581 --> 34:15.523
But it was also a
really hard upperthrust,

34:15.524 --> 34:18.626
hard enough to break
the tip off of the knife

34:18.627 --> 34:20.528
on the vertebrae.

34:20.529 --> 34:23.191
Girl, you about to
unleash the kraken.

34:23.192 --> 34:26.294
I just can't get over
the force of the blow.

34:26.295 --> 34:27.535
Oh! Ouch!

34:27.536 --> 34:28.766
(Laughs)

34:28.767 --> 34:30.268
(Chuckles) (Tablet beeps)

34:30.269 --> 34:32.600
There is no way justine
could've done this.

34:32.601 --> 34:33.601
Not even a man.

34:33.602 --> 34:34.602
Here we go.

34:34.603 --> 34:36.174
Epichlorohydrin.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.675
Before it wound up in Walt,

34:37.676 --> 34:40.548
that knife had contact
with epoxy glue.

34:40.549 --> 34:42.550
I think we should
ask Peter about...

34:42.551 --> 34:44.582
Where you go...

34:44.583 --> 34:47.586
Well, then give me
one of these peppers.

34:48.817 --> 34:50.689
Ooh, girl. That's good.

34:52.691 --> 34:54.192
(Morris) Is that the exact glue

34:54.193 --> 34:55.593
you found on the knife fragment?

34:55.594 --> 34:57.325
Identical.

34:57.326 --> 34:59.367
Dave didn't say
where he was going.

34:59.368 --> 35:00.768
I've seen this before,
Mrs. Stackhouse.

35:00.769 --> 35:02.130
You are stonewalling me.

35:02.131 --> 35:04.432
Look, I already told
you everything I know.

35:04.433 --> 35:07.535
Walt yelled at Cal a week ago.

35:07.536 --> 35:09.207
Dave insisted he was sick.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.238
Dave was right.

35:10.239 --> 35:11.239
Dr. Hunt.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.541
Look, Dave loved Walt.

35:13.542 --> 35:14.712
He'd never hurt him.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.345
Then I suggest
you help us find him.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.848
We've been short on cash.

35:20.849 --> 35:23.321
Dave's at work. He
took an extra shift.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.394
Thank you.

35:26.895 --> 35:29.227
This is Philly p.D.

35:29.228 --> 35:31.499
Dave Stackhouse, we
have a warrant for your arrest

35:31.500 --> 35:33.130
for the murder of Walter brown.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.232
What the hell is going on?

35:34.233 --> 35:35.563
You have the right
to remain silent.

35:35.564 --> 35:37.305
Anything you say can and will...
Put your hands behind your back.

35:37.306 --> 35:38.666
Be used against you in a
court of law. (Handcuffs click)

35:38.667 --> 35:39.907
(Colin) Dave? You
gotta be kidding me.

35:39.908 --> 35:41.138
You have the right to
an attorney. (Groans)

35:41.139 --> 35:42.270
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

35:42.271 --> 35:43.871
an attorney will
be provided for you.

35:43.872 --> 35:45.673
(Voice fades) Do you
understand these rights...

35:45.674 --> 35:49.717
You already admitted
you were angry with him

35:49.718 --> 35:51.649
and you fought
with him that night.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.252
And now we have
epoxy from your hands

35:54.253 --> 35:55.683
on a fragment

35:55.684 --> 35:57.186
of the knife.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.328
(Voice breaking)
Walt wasn't himself.

36:00.329 --> 36:01.629
Look...

36:01.630 --> 36:04.192
I called him out, and that
must have shaken him up.

36:04.193 --> 36:05.733
What happened afterwards?

36:05.734 --> 36:07.265
Walt phoned,

36:07.266 --> 36:09.467
told me to meet
him at his old place.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.168
When I got there,

36:11.169 --> 36:13.201
he was in a rage.

36:13.202 --> 36:14.702
He had a knife in his hand,

36:14.703 --> 36:16.173
and he was cutting
open stacks of money,

36:16.174 --> 36:17.445
throwing 'em out the window.

36:17.446 --> 36:19.447
He was saying, winning the money

36:19.448 --> 36:21.849
was the worst thing that
ever happened to him.

36:21.850 --> 36:23.611
So you decided to...

36:23.612 --> 36:25.783
Liberate him of it.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.915
No, he wasn't in his right mind.

36:27.916 --> 36:29.787
I tried to stop him,

36:29.788 --> 36:31.859
but he had the knife, and...

36:31.860 --> 36:33.262
(Whimpers)

36:36.865 --> 36:39.797
(Cries) And it was an accident.

36:39.798 --> 36:41.799
(Sam) Doesn't sound like one.

36:41.800 --> 36:45.873
You're under arrest for
the murder of Walter brown.

36:45.874 --> 36:47.675
Hold on. Hold on.

36:47.676 --> 36:50.738
In case you hadn't noticed,
we just got a confession.

36:50.739 --> 36:51.739
(Grunts)

36:53.812 --> 36:55.883
Dave had an accomplice.

36:55.884 --> 36:57.615
(Morris) Really?

36:57.616 --> 36:59.947
And who might that be?

36:59.948 --> 37:01.720
Walt.

37:10.359 --> 37:11.559
Push.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.831
(Groans) Try to lift
up your arm. Come on.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.463
(Grunts and groans)

37:15.464 --> 37:17.365
See?

37:17.366 --> 37:19.667
He doesn't have the
arm strength to inflict

37:19.668 --> 37:21.369
the kind of wound that Walt had.

37:21.370 --> 37:22.710
He's faking it.

37:22.711 --> 37:24.972
(Sighs)

37:24.973 --> 37:26.714
Lift up your arm.

37:26.715 --> 37:29.577
Put your hand right
there on his bicep.

37:29.578 --> 37:31.780
(Sighs)

37:32.851 --> 37:34.021
Feel anything?

37:34.022 --> 37:35.623
Other than you
hitting his elbow? No.

37:35.624 --> 37:36.784
Those muscles
should be twitching.

37:36.785 --> 37:38.856
It's called severe
bicep atrophy.

37:38.857 --> 37:41.689
It's caused by a pinched
nerve in the c-5 vertebra.

37:41.690 --> 37:42.890
(Grunts) Sorry.

37:42.891 --> 37:46.734
Which comes from hunching
over a welding torch for years.

37:46.735 --> 37:48.736
But you're right.

37:48.737 --> 37:50.568
Other than that,
he's totally faking.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.600
He could still stab a man. No.

37:52.601 --> 37:53.601
Not with the force required

37:53.602 --> 37:55.303
to break off a knife
on Walt's spine.

37:55.304 --> 37:56.774
Walt was a big guy.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.407
So you believe me?

37:59.648 --> 38:01.609
I didn't think anyone would.

38:01.610 --> 38:04.352
Well, if it's any
help, I still don't.

38:04.353 --> 38:06.455
Mm, and I'm with
bud on this one.

38:08.917 --> 38:11.690
Got a tough crowd here.

38:14.663 --> 38:16.425
Tell me exactly what happened.

38:18.967 --> 38:21.869
Walt lunged at me.

38:21.870 --> 38:23.631
We struggled over the knife.

38:23.632 --> 38:27.305
I feel backwards, and
he landed on top of me.

38:28.477 --> 38:30.738
He impaled himself on the knife

38:30.739 --> 38:32.309
with the weight of his own body.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.611
And then he went down,

38:33.612 --> 38:35.082
and there was... He
was bleeding everywhere,

38:35.083 --> 38:36.714
and I tried to save him.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.646
This was an accident.
It wasn't a murder.

38:38.647 --> 38:40.748
Where's the evidence?

38:40.749 --> 38:42.391
(Exhales deeply)

38:43.692 --> 38:45.494
Lift up your shirt.

38:49.558 --> 38:50.898
That bruise corresponds

38:50.899 --> 38:53.601
to the hilt of the knife that
pressed into Dave's body

38:53.602 --> 38:55.364
when the two of them fell.

38:56.705 --> 38:58.906
Then why take the knife?

38:58.907 --> 39:00.067
Because my prints were on it.

39:00.068 --> 39:02.069
I didn't think anyone
would believe me.

39:02.070 --> 39:05.043
I was just trying to get
the knife away from him.

39:06.815 --> 39:10.718
You were right to help Walt.

39:10.719 --> 39:12.650
He was very sick.

39:12.651 --> 39:15.653
And you're the only one
who cared about him enough

39:15.654 --> 39:17.655
to...

39:17.656 --> 39:20.358
Know that something
was very wrong.

39:22.691 --> 39:25.933
Acinetobacter calcoaceticus.

39:25.934 --> 39:28.796
Hard to say.

39:28.797 --> 39:31.669
Even harder to kill.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.040
This was a bit
tougher assignment

39:33.041 --> 39:34.802
than I'd hoped for you.

39:34.803 --> 39:36.504
No.

39:36.505 --> 39:37.705
Listen, I don't want
to put you through

39:37.706 --> 39:38.946
telling Kimberly's family.

39:38.947 --> 39:40.608
That time will come.

39:40.609 --> 39:43.481
(Indistinct conversations)

39:43.482 --> 39:44.783
Dr. Murphy.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.656
It's my job.

39:48.657 --> 39:52.590
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

39:52.591 --> 39:55.994

my stars" playing)

39:59.428 --> 40:00.768

40:04.733 --> 40:07.775
Your files, all scanned.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.815

40:17.816 --> 40:20.187
It might not seem like a lot,
but it will mean more to you

40:20.188 --> 40:23.891
because... (Chuckles)
You've earned it.

40:23.892 --> 40:26.754
No, it's perfect. We
have to go to the mall.
