00:02.336 --> 00:04.672
MAN:
Hi, there.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.507
CHRIS ROCK:
In professional sports,

00:06.540 --> 00:08.742
the best athletes
get a sneaker contract.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.411
Are those Air Jordans?

00:10.444 --> 00:12.380
Yeah. My dad got
them for me last year.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.481
Oh, that's so cool.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.083
He's like the best
guy in the NBA.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.485
As cool as it was having
Jordan sneakers,

00:17.518 --> 00:20.654
it was nowhere near as cool
as having a varsity letter.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.423
Man, I would set
these sneakers on fire

00:22.456 --> 00:24.325
and eat them
for a varsity letter.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.460
That's how David Blaine
got his.

00:26.494 --> 00:27.795
I'd get respect.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.796
Good morning, sir.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.398
Here are your books.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.266
What time would you like
to smack the crap out of me?

00:32.300 --> 00:34.268
2:30.
Thank you, sir.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.603
I'd get perks.

00:35.636 --> 00:36.770
Chris,

00:36.804 --> 00:38.772
you're excused from
all of your classes.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.508
Professor Lee will be
taking them for you.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.176
Is he smart?

00:42.210 --> 00:43.644
Chris, he's Asian.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.415
If you could turn
his smart into black,

00:47.448 --> 00:50.084
he'd be darker than Yaphet
Kotto in a pot of chocolate.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.252
Cool.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.520
If Yaphet Kotto fell

00:52.553 --> 00:54.822
into your pot of chocolate,
how would you know?

00:54.855 --> 01:00.261
And I'd get the only thing
I really cared about-- girls.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.729
GIRLS:
Good morning, Chris.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.164
Good morning, angels.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.373
Watch it, Jabbar.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.574
Oh, man, he
scuffed your shoe.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.708
I don't care
about this shoe.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.009
I want to get one
of them letters.

01:16.043 --> 01:19.513
And the letter's gonna get me
one of those girls.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.629
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.916
CHRIS ROCK:
Wanting a letter was one thing.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.152
Figuring out how to get it
was a whole other story.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.687
How am I supposed to
get a letter in a sport

01:59.720 --> 02:01.322
when I'm terrible
at sports?

02:01.355 --> 02:03.424
Maybe there's something
a guy like you would be good at.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.226
I need a sport
without water,

02:05.259 --> 02:08.496
balls, hoops, hurdles,
bats, cleats, clubs, gloves,

02:08.529 --> 02:11.265
tracks, fields,
weights or boards.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.433
Isn't that cheerleading?

02:12.466 --> 02:14.302
How about wrestling?

02:14.335 --> 02:15.369
I can't wrestle.
Anybody can wrestle.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.837
It's just two
guys on a mat

02:16.870 --> 02:18.005
trying to throw
each other down.

02:18.038 --> 02:20.874
Or as they call it
in Chelsea, "Wednesday."

02:20.908 --> 02:22.576
No way. I'll get killed.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.744
I only weigh 112 pounds.

02:23.777 --> 02:24.612
They got weight classes.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.447
You only have to fight
people your size.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.349
If you can't beat a guy
who weighs 112 pounds,

02:28.382 --> 02:30.484
you don't deserve
that letter.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.820
* The B to the R,
Double-O, K, Lyn *

02:32.853 --> 02:34.922
* Comin' straight from Brooklyn,
you know that I'm-a win *

02:34.955 --> 02:37.391
* The B to the R,
Double-O, K, Lyn *

02:37.425 --> 02:39.627
* The B to the R, Double-O,
K, Lyn... *

02:39.660 --> 02:40.594
I can do that.

02:40.628 --> 02:41.462
Do what?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.197
Make a video
for Video Turntable.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.232
You can't sing.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.566
I'm not gonna sing.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.800
I'm gonna be the producer,

02:46.834 --> 02:48.569
like Hurby Luv Bug
with Salt-N-Pepa.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.471
How you gonna do that?

02:50.504 --> 02:53.207
Yo, welcome back.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.476
Hey! Want to get your video
played on Video Turntable?

02:55.509 --> 02:56.977
Send it in and get paid.

02:57.010 --> 02:57.945
The more it gets played,

02:57.978 --> 03:00.981
The more you gets * paid.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.317
Yo. Section Eight. Hit me.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.718
* In-In-novator

03:04.752 --> 03:06.954
* In-novator,
in-in-ovator... *

03:06.987 --> 03:08.622
See? I told you.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.524
I'm gonna put together
a girl group,

03:10.558 --> 03:11.992
make a video
and get it on TV.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.761
It'll be cool.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.996
* I'm the Arabian Prince
and the crew is the Sheiks *

03:16.029 --> 03:19.333
* We are here
to move your feet *

03:19.367 --> 03:21.702
Can I be in it?
No.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.837
* To rock the population,
give you no compensation... *

03:23.871 --> 03:25.973
While Tonya tried to get
into Drew's group,

03:26.006 --> 03:28.576
my mother tried to get
into a pair of jeans.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.786
Dang it!

03:50.398 --> 03:52.600
She sweated less
during childbirth.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.801
That's it.

03:53.834 --> 03:54.968
I'm going on a diet.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.604
While my mother

03:56.637 --> 03:58.739
was struggling
to put on her jeans,

03:58.772 --> 04:01.309
I was struggling
to put on a brave face.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.617
Nice job.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.951
Next.

04:17.991 --> 04:18.992
What do you weigh?

04:19.026 --> 04:20.828
One-twelve.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.796
We got nobody
in your weight class.

04:22.830 --> 04:26.500
Guess I'll just leave, then.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.669
Don't be an idiot.

04:28.702 --> 04:29.903
You weighed in at 112.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.639
You'll wrestle 113.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.641
Got nobody in
your weight class?

04:33.674 --> 04:36.677
You're automatically
on the varsity.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.811
The first time in my life

04:37.845 --> 04:40.614
being a skinny nerd
worked in my favor.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.683
Meanwhile, Drew found
a place to rehearse

04:42.716 --> 04:44.352
with a man who drove a hearse.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.654
So I just need to rent
your place for rehearsals.

04:46.687 --> 04:50.524
Huh. So you won't be videotaping
anything untoward, will you?

04:50.558 --> 04:51.825
I don't know
what that means.

04:51.859 --> 04:55.896
It means-- lewd, nude, crude,

04:55.929 --> 04:57.598
lascivious, naked,

04:57.631 --> 04:59.066
nasty.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.634
In that case, no.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.703
Okay, then, pay me
half in advance.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.442
Oh. Nice doing business
with you, Drew.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.847
* Uh... Uh...

05:13.881 --> 05:14.915
* Uh...

05:14.948 --> 05:16.083
* Uh.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.451
Next!

05:17.485 --> 05:18.819
* Zzp, zzp, zzp, zzp

05:18.852 --> 05:21.355
* Hee-he-he-he-how,
hee-he-he-he-he-he-how *

05:21.389 --> 05:22.556
* Hee-he-he-he-how

05:22.590 --> 05:23.791
* Hee-he-he-he-he-he-how

05:23.824 --> 05:25.893
* Hee-he-he-he-how,
hee-he-he-he-he-he-how *

05:25.926 --> 05:26.927
* Hee-he-he-he-how
Next.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.961
* Hee-he-he-he-how.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.033
Aren't you gonna do something?

05:33.066 --> 05:34.635
Why don't you do something?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.537
'Cause I'm the one
auditioning you.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.906
No one talk to Princess Latifah
like that!

05:38.939 --> 05:40.073
Next!

05:58.125 --> 05:59.460
That was cool.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.828
So, what's the name
of your group?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.396
It's gonna be called
Fish and Chips.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.163
So, you guys in?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.598
Yeah!
Yeah!

06:04.632 --> 06:05.933
Cool.

06:05.966 --> 06:06.967
While Drew was taking

06:07.000 --> 06:08.836
his first steps
towards the charts,

06:08.869 --> 06:10.838
I was taking my first steps
on the mat.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.741
Chris, since this is
your first day on the mat,

06:13.774 --> 06:15.643
I'm gonna walk you
through some moves.

06:15.676 --> 06:16.910
You watch wrestling on TV?

06:16.944 --> 06:17.911
All the time.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.481
Hulk Hogan, Andre the
Giant, the Iron Sheik.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.782
I love all those guys.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.817
Well, that's too bad,
'cause all that crap is fake.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.787
Oh. Well, what's first?

06:29.490 --> 06:31.625
This is a cross-face.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.765
This is the neck scissors.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.770
This is a half nelson.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.642
This is the full nelson.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.979
This is a Ricky Nelson.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.814
That's a joke--
Ricky Nelson.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.517
See, I said half,
full, then Ricky.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.685
You like that?

06:57.718 --> 06:58.886
Hilarious.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.921
Back at home, I found out

07:00.954 --> 07:02.956
when the woman of the house
goes on a diet,

07:02.990 --> 07:06.193
everybody in the house
goes on a diet.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.828
Okay, everybody,

07:07.861 --> 07:09.730
dinner is served.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.932
No, it ain't.
What is this?

07:11.965 --> 07:14.502
It's the Nipsey Russell
Bermudian Diet.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.236
Why are we
on a diet?

07:16.269 --> 07:19.507
Because we put our jeans on,
and they won't button.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.843
How come we can't eat
because your jeans don't fit?

07:22.876 --> 07:24.578
Yeah, why don't you just buy
a bigger pair of jeans?

07:24.612 --> 07:26.747
Because, nobody asked you.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.981
Nipsey Russell ain't fat.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.883
What's he know about diets?
Oh, when he went

07:29.917 --> 07:31.685
to Bermuda to do a comedy show,

07:31.719 --> 07:34.054
he found that the women
were very attractive.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.056
Because they were the only
ones on the island.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.927
They stay slim by only
eating fish and fruits.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.129
So he decided to smash it up
and put it in a glass?

07:42.162 --> 07:43.263
Yes.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.065
I'd rather eat the glass.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.835
Well, I hope he took out
the seeds and the bones.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.538
Look, unless you guys want me
to end up being fat,

07:50.571 --> 07:51.839
can you at least try it?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.674
Well, I guess I
do need to keep

07:53.707 --> 07:56.076
my weight down--
I made the wrestling team.
My man.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.678
You gonna be
the next Iron sheik.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.079
See, Nipsey can help you.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.615
TONYA:
Well, me and Drew
are making a video.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.250
I guess I should
watch my weight, too.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.852
I heard the camera
adds ten pounds.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.520
Only if you eat them first.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.021
You're not in
the group.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.990
I will be.

08:12.025 --> 08:15.529
While my dad drank up,
I prepared to get beat up.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.101
COACH:
Look for it.
Look for it.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.803
Look, he's giving it to you.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.572
Work it, work it.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.873
Look for the leg.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.708
Don't lock up!

08:27.741 --> 08:30.010
REFEREE:
Point to red!

08:31.712 --> 08:34.948
(bones crunching,
wrestler shrieking)

08:34.982 --> 08:36.249
Yeah!

08:41.154 --> 08:43.290
Get him... Get him off.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.293
I joined the wrestling team so
I could get a varsity letter,

08:46.326 --> 08:48.929
but now I was afraid
I would get three of them--

08:48.962 --> 08:50.230
D.O.A.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.266
Smart bastard.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.035
He used a Manhattan
Neck Snap.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.303
They just
legalized it.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.238
You didn't mention
I could get my neck snapped.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.940
We had a lot to go over.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.009
That might be something
you want to mention.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.577
Look, you want to
get your letter?

09:03.611 --> 09:05.045
Get out on that mat-- now.

09:17.090 --> 09:20.193
The Tessio Tigers
do not have a wrestler

09:20.227 --> 09:22.129
to compete in this weight class,

09:22.162 --> 09:24.197
and therefore,
the Tattaglia Sleeping Fish

09:24.231 --> 09:26.266
win by default!

09:28.168 --> 09:30.771
Look at you, with your win
by forfeit, huh?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.873
You're one step closer
to that letter.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.943
I'm just glad
my neck still works.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.915
Back at school, the Black
Plague was killing them.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.064
While I was
on top of the world,

09:57.097 --> 09:59.132
Tonya was just trying
to get put on.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.034
Have you found a
third member yet?

10:01.068 --> 10:03.236
No, not yet, but I will soon.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.305
See ya tomorrow.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.273
See ya.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.975
See ya!

10:19.052 --> 10:21.789
* So all you fly mothers

10:21.822 --> 10:23.891
* Get on out there and dance

10:23.924 --> 10:26.359
* Dance, I said

10:26.393 --> 10:28.962
* Salt-N-Pepa's hit,
and we're in effect *

10:28.996 --> 10:30.764
* Want you to push it, babe

10:30.798 --> 10:34.301
* Coolin' by day, then at night
working up a sweat *

10:34.334 --> 10:36.770
* Come on, girls,
let's go show the guys *

10:36.804 --> 10:39.206
* That we know
how to become number one *

10:39.239 --> 10:40.874
* In a hot party show

10:40.908 --> 10:42.375
* Now push it

10:42.409 --> 10:43.777
* Push it *

10:43.811 --> 10:45.713
* Push it good

10:45.746 --> 10:47.848
* Push it *

10:47.881 --> 10:49.416
* Push it real good

10:49.449 --> 10:51.251
* Ah, push it *

10:51.284 --> 10:53.821
* Push it good.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.024
Whoa.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.759
When did you learn
how to do that?

10:58.792 --> 10:59.893
It doesn't matter.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.228
Now, am I in the group or not?

11:01.261 --> 11:03.396
Yeah.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.165
All right, then.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.134
While Tonya had made the group,

11:07.167 --> 11:09.302
my mother was making
more shakes.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.839
I made extra in case
anybody wants seconds.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.440
Nobody wanted firsts.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.943
Hey, Chris, how's it going
on the wrestling team?

11:15.976 --> 11:17.911
Oh, I'm undefeated.
They call me the Black Plague.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.147
Isn't that an insult?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.849
Well, I'm just glad
you're winning.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.216
You don't want to know
the things they called

11:23.250 --> 11:24.584
Jackie Robinson.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.154
If you really want to know, ask
Michael Richards or Don Imus.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.856
You know, these shakes
would be really good

11:28.889 --> 11:30.090
with a burger and some fries.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.892
Can we get some real food?

11:31.925 --> 11:33.460
Yeah. I'm hungry.
Me, too.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.895
Look, why don't

11:34.928 --> 11:36.429
we all just give this diet
a chance?

11:36.463 --> 11:38.365
I think it's pretty good,
actually.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.333
My father didn't
really like the shakes.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.003
He just found out
it was cheaper than groceries.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.772
And, you know,
since we've been on this diet,

11:44.805 --> 11:46.373
I've saved over $50
in groceries.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.175
Told you.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.877
While I was waiting
on my letter,

11:49.910 --> 11:51.411
Drew was handing his out.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.013
So these are your costumes.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.181
I don't like these.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.983
What's wrong with what I had on?

11:56.016 --> 11:58.018
It'll look better on TV.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.187
Tonya, just wear
what I gave you.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.390
Okay, we have rehearsals
every day at 3:00.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.325
I'm not rehearsing at 3:00.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.894
That's when
I watch my game shows.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.461
Let's do it at 4:00.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.429
Is that cool with y'all?

12:09.462 --> 12:10.764
Yeah.
Works for me.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.039
Later, it turned out
everybody in the house

12:19.072 --> 12:20.307
was on a diet
when they were together.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.777
When they were apart,
it was a different story.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.048
My mother ate fries...

12:32.986 --> 12:35.355
Tonya ate slices...

12:43.163 --> 12:45.332
Drew ate doughnuts...

12:50.137 --> 12:53.206
And I ate it all.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.942
What's all this for?

12:54.975 --> 12:56.343
Something to show
our appreciation

12:56.376 --> 12:58.045
for representing
our school so well.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.279
And, if you
get a letter,

12:59.312 --> 13:00.580
there's more where
that came from.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.549
A lot more.
A lot more.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.485
Unfortunately, they were
still talking about cookies.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.054
The only one who was drinking

13:07.087 --> 13:08.856
instead of eating
was my father.

13:08.889 --> 13:09.923
This stuff is pretty good!

13:09.957 --> 13:11.291
Y'all want some more?
No.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.226
No. That's all right.
I gotta go

13:13.260 --> 13:14.594
clip my toenails.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.229
More for me.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.298
While my father
was pounding shakes,

13:18.331 --> 13:20.000
I was pounding cake.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.302
Chris, get
on the scale.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.237
Hold this.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.943
One-fourteen.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.845
You're going to have to
wrestle a class up today.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.080
How did that happen?

13:33.113 --> 13:34.181
What did you expect?

13:34.214 --> 13:35.515
You ate a couple
pieces of pound cake,

13:35.548 --> 13:37.150
so you gained
a couple of pounds.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.551
Anyways, I gotta go
to drama club.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.087
Be careful
out there, man.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.022
I'm not worried about it.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.257
What difference
could a pound make?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.459
None, unless I had
to fight somebody.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.339
Ow.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.878
Not even Don King
could have fixed that match.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.150
Unfortunately for me,
they found a cure

14:10.183 --> 14:12.452
for the Black Plague:
a good ass whooping.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.486
Hey, Coach.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.957
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.558
I'm not your coach anymore.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.093
What?

14:20.127 --> 14:21.962
Yeah, look,
you had a good run,

14:21.995 --> 14:23.530
but you're off the team.

14:23.563 --> 14:24.998
How am I off the team?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.099
I was undefeated.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.268
Look, at 113,
you were 7-0,

14:28.301 --> 14:29.937
but you gained weight,
you went up a class.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.104
You're 0-1.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.940
I'm sorry there, Plague.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.042
Reign of terror is done.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.144
Do I still get my
varsity letter?

14:37.177 --> 14:39.512
Look, you showed up
for practice,

14:39.546 --> 14:42.082
you put in the time,
and you won by forfeit.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.516
I can't penalize you for that,

14:43.550 --> 14:45.485
but when you actually
had to compete

14:45.518 --> 14:47.087
against somebody, you lost.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.589
Now, I could
give you a letter,

14:49.622 --> 14:52.559
but it would be
an "L" for "loser."

14:52.592 --> 14:54.194
Maybe next time.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.063
Let's go.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.965
Hey.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.535
Oh, Chris.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.305
What were you thinking,
getting out on that mat?

15:05.338 --> 15:07.240
I was trying to get
a varsity letter.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.708
Well, you didn't need
to go out there

15:08.741 --> 15:11.044
and let those boys
go upside your head for that.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.645
There are other ways
to get a letter.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.247
Like what?

15:14.281 --> 15:16.049
You could audition
for the drama club.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.518
You can get a letter
for being an actor?
Sure.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.255
I bet you'd be a natural,
like Jim Kelly, Jim Brown,

15:22.289 --> 15:24.457
Blackula, O.J. Simpson.

15:24.491 --> 15:28.195
Your people have a natural
facility for deception.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.463
Why not use it
to your advantage?

15:30.497 --> 15:32.399
'Cause I'm too busy
robbing people,

15:32.432 --> 15:35.235
dealing drugs
and making babies.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.005
While I was thinking about
acting, Tonya was acting out.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.206
* Baby, baby

15:39.239 --> 15:41.274
* Ooh, baby, baby.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.976
All right,
that was pretty good.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.077
It was sloppy.

15:44.111 --> 15:47.047
Let's take it from the top.
No, Tonya, it was fine.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.681
Do you want fine
or spectacular?

15:50.050 --> 15:51.618
All right, let's take it
from the top.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.186
Thank you.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.487
("Push it" by Salt-N-Pepa
playing)

15:54.521 --> 15:55.722
* Push it...

15:55.755 --> 15:58.591
And five, six,
seven, eight.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.634
You're eating
a Slopper?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.602
You want a bite?

16:11.538 --> 16:13.540
So I've been spending money
on shakes

16:13.573 --> 16:15.408
while you've been
wasting money on food?

16:15.442 --> 16:18.378
Only my father would think food
was a waste of money.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.047
ALL:
Yes.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.583
I work two jobs, and you
let me leave the house

16:23.616 --> 16:25.285
with nothing on my stomach

16:25.318 --> 16:26.386
but a fish juice shake?

16:26.419 --> 16:29.089
Not cool,
unless your husband's a shark.

16:29.122 --> 16:32.592
If this is how you do when
you're trying to get skinny,

16:32.625 --> 16:34.427
I'd rather have you fat.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.364
That's what Kirstie Alley's man
said to her.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.400
Chris, I'm so glad
you decided to audition.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.701
I need a letter.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.637
So, what have you prepared
for us, Chris?

16:44.671 --> 16:46.673
I would like to do a selection
from Uncle Ben's Cabin.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.509
You mean Uncle Tom's Cabin?
No.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.411
Uncle Ben's-- it's
a lesser known work

16:51.444 --> 16:52.645
by Mark Twain's
cousin, Dwayne.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.680
Dwayne Twain?

16:53.713 --> 16:56.616
Yes.
Go ahead.

16:59.086 --> 17:03.256
Rice, rice, rice.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.359
You think all I
knows is rice?

17:06.393 --> 17:08.328
I was there when George
Washington Carver

17:08.361 --> 17:10.363
shucked that
first peanut.

17:10.397 --> 17:15.502
I make yams and corn and cotton,

17:15.535 --> 17:18.805
but all America wants is
them little grains of rice.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.773
I gives

17:20.807 --> 17:24.344
and I gives...

17:26.513 --> 17:30.517
...till I can't gives no more.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.756
Still I rise.

17:36.789 --> 17:41.661
Oh, Chris, I have just the part
for you in our next production.

17:43.696 --> 17:47.400
At the video shoot, Tonya
was ready for her close-up.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.502
Look, Tonya, for the sake
of art and commerce,

17:49.536 --> 17:51.371
let's just get along, okay?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.706
Honey, it's showtime.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.209
Roll the tape.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.744
Start the camera.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.884
* Ooh, baby, baby

18:04.917 --> 18:06.586
* Baby, baby

18:06.619 --> 18:08.488
* Ooh, baby, baby

18:08.521 --> 18:10.757
* B-baby, baby...

18:10.790 --> 18:13.260
I'm still mad.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.797
Does that make
it better?

18:17.830 --> 18:19.466
A little.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.305
How about that?

18:25.338 --> 18:27.774
Mmm... that's
pretty good.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.213
How about that?

18:33.246 --> 18:35.648
Why was I mad again?

18:36.983 --> 18:40.220
While my parents were
making up, I was acting out.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.322
Oh, Abe,

18:42.355 --> 18:43.723
this is a wonderful play.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.825
I think you're
going to like it.

18:58.771 --> 19:02.242
Yo, keep sending in
those videos, but remember,

19:02.275 --> 19:05.378
your song has to be original
to be aired.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.846
Keep watching Video Turntable.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.581
Well, thanks
for the rehearsal space.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.916
Yeah, too bad it
didn't pay off,

19:09.949 --> 19:11.418
but any idiot knows

19:11.451 --> 19:12.719
you're supposed to
sing your own songs.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.820
That's okay.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.922
You guys will figure out
something better next time.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.590
Yeah, well,
good luck.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.460
There won't be a
next time with me.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.661
I'm taking the
other girls

19:21.694 --> 19:23.196
and we're starting
our own group.

19:23.230 --> 19:26.433
Called TMA: Too Much Attitude.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.635
Ooh...

19:28.668 --> 19:29.869
Bam!

19:31.304 --> 19:32.539
Ma, why are you
wearing my jeans?

19:32.572 --> 19:33.740
These are my jeans.

19:33.773 --> 19:34.741
No, they're not.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.443
They're my ten dollar
lucky jeans.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.545
I always keep ten dollars
in the right front pocket.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.215
You mean I've been
killing myself

19:42.249 --> 19:44.251
to get into a boy's
pair of pants?

19:44.284 --> 19:45.418
You and Michael Jackson.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.486
That was...

19:46.519 --> 19:49.856
$98.45 worth of wasted shakes.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.591
It's not a
total waste.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.496
Baby, give me a biscuit.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.400
You're a terrible
producer.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.001
The next day at school,

20:02.034 --> 20:04.837
my quest for a varsity letter
finally came to an end.

20:04.871 --> 20:05.905
What's this?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.574
It's your letter.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.446
This is a letter.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.981
Exactly.

20:15.014 --> 20:18.418
It's a letter welcoming you
into the Varsity Drama Club.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.354
If only I could letter
in choking the principal out.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.290
* Everybody hates Chris.
