<b>Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...</b>

<b>Vast riches... Hidden treasures...</b>

00:14.670 --> 00:18.280
<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.140 --> 00:23.250
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.250 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.790 --> 00:29.590
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.160 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:55.990 --> 01:59.350
<b>I'll tear your body apart.</b>

02:11.400 --> 02:16.400
<b>Last x Test Of x Resolve</b>

02:17.650 --> 02:19.360
<b>During the exam's Third Phase,</b>

02:19.360 --> 02:22.180
<b>which requires applicants to 
reach Trick Tower's base</b>

02:22.180 --> 02:24.410
<b>within seventy-two hours,</b>

02:24.410 --> 02:29.740
<b>Gon and his friends have incurred 
a penalty of fifty hours.</b>

02:32.780 --> 02:33.920
<b>Meanwhile...</b>

02:45.710 --> 02:49.540
<b>Gerreta, applicant #384, 
is the fourth to pass.</b>

02:49.540 --> 02:53.430
<b>Total time, twelve hours 
and twenty-seven minutes.</b>

02:53.430 --> 02:54.340
<b>Eh...</b>

02:54.340 --> 02:56.690
<b>Not bad, I guess.</b>

03:00.910 --> 03:04.230
<b>If you hesitate on the first step, 
you'll hurt yourself.</b>

03:04.230 --> 03:05.330
<b>Got it.</b>

03:05.330 --> 03:07.300
<b>Hey, Kurapika.</b>

03:07.300 --> 03:10.040
<b>Once we've spent fifty hours here,</b>

03:10.040 --> 03:12.580
<b>we'll have fewer than ten hours, right?</b>

03:12.580 --> 03:14.800
<b>Yes, that's correct.</b>

03:14.800 --> 03:18.170
<b>That's way more than enough time!</b>

03:18.170 --> 03:19.410
<b>You're a fool.</b>

03:19.410 --> 03:20.220
<b>What's that?</b>

03:20.220 --> 03:24.470
<b>Phase Three lasts seventy-two hours.</b>

03:24.470 --> 03:27.280
<b>And each phase is designed to weed out</b>

03:27.280 --> 03:30.340
<b>half of the remaining candidates.</b>

03:30.340 --> 03:33.980
<b>So, on average, it's meant to 
take seventy-two hours.</b>

03:34.520 --> 03:37.590
<b>Just more proof that you're an idiot.</b>

03:38.800 --> 03:42.580
<b>Well, our chances of reaching 
the goal within ten hours</b>

03:42.580 --> 03:44.740
<b>will depend on the remaining trials.</b>

03:44.740 --> 03:47.170
<b>Yeah, that's true.</b>

03:48.100 --> 03:50.700
<b>But when we've got a guy 
who's so down on his luck,</b>

03:50.700 --> 03:53.050
<b>he can't even win a simple game 
of rock-paper-scissors...</b>

03:53.050 --> 03:54.000
<b>What was that?!</b>

03:54.520 --> 03:57.380
<b>You deliberately lost a bet, 
just to satiate your libido.</b>

03:57.380 --> 04:01.090
<b>Then you chose rock-paper-scissors, 
a contest you couldn't win.</b>

04:01.090 --> 04:02.550
<b>Shut up!</b>

04:02.550 --> 04:05.590
<b>You surrendered without even a fight!</b>

04:07.260 --> 04:08.140
<b><i>I...</i></b>

04:08.140 --> 04:10.270
<b><i>I give!</i></b>

04:10.270 --> 04:13.960
<b>Sure, I surrendered.</b>

04:13.960 --> 04:16.900
<b>But I only wasted a second of our time.</b>

04:17.790 --> 04:19.270
<b>You lost,</b>

04:19.270 --> 04:22.820
<b>squandering fifty of our remaining hours.</b>

04:23.350 --> 04:25.780
<b>Take some responsibility, huh?</b>

04:27.290 --> 04:29.500
<b>Besides, what kind of Hunter</b>

04:29.500 --> 04:31.910
<b>is so bad at gambling?</b>

04:31.910 --> 04:33.080
<b>Shut up!</b>

04:33.080 --> 04:35.620
<b>You don't even want to become a Hunter...</b>

04:35.620 --> 04:38.540
<b>You only care about ruining our chances.</b>

04:39.680 --> 04:42.300
<b><i>And now, you'll have 
the guilt eating at you</i></b>

04:42.300 --> 04:44.800
<b><i>for the rest of this exam phase.</i></b>

04:47.310 --> 04:49.330
<b>Hey! What are you doing?</b>

04:49.330 --> 04:50.650
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

04:50.650 --> 04:53.780
<b>Don't skateboard inside this tiny room!</b>

04:53.780 --> 04:55.440
<b>Aww...</b>

05:31.070 --> 05:32.610
<b>Can't sleep?</b>

05:34.120 --> 05:35.410
<b>That's not it.</b>

05:35.410 --> 05:37.740
<b>I can go two or three days</b>

05:37.740 --> 05:38.980
<b>without sleep.</b>

05:40.170 --> 05:42.270
<b>Ten hours have passed, huh...</b>

05:42.730 --> 05:44.990
<b>There aren't any windows, 
so it's hard to tell.</b>

05:44.990 --> 05:46.960
<b>But it's probably morning.</b>

05:46.960 --> 05:48.530
<b>Most likely.</b>

06:11.610 --> 06:13.670
<b>Hey, pipe down.</b>

06:16.020 --> 06:18.730
<b>Let me sleep some more...</b>

06:20.880 --> 06:21.650
<b>That stinks!</b>

06:26.150 --> 06:28.000
<b>What's wrong with you guys?</b>

06:28.000 --> 06:29.660
<b>That wasn't funny.</b>

06:30.120 --> 06:33.710
<b>Bastard, you'd better not 
be pretending to sleep.</b>

06:36.290 --> 06:39.230
<b>Damn, now I'm totally awake...</b>

06:39.230 --> 06:43.000
<b>And we still have forty hours left?</b>

07:02.460 --> 07:04.420
<b>Oh, I thought you just had</b>

07:04.420 --> 07:06.910
<b>to stick bait on a hook, 
and you could fish.</b>

07:06.910 --> 07:07.780
<b>Yeah.</b>

07:07.780 --> 07:09.970
<b>You have to think like a fish.</b>

07:09.970 --> 07:11.610
<b>Think like a fish?</b>

07:11.610 --> 07:12.590
<b>Yep!</b>

07:12.590 --> 07:16.010
<b>How would a fish feel if it saw 
bait dangling in front of it?</b>

07:16.010 --> 07:17.050
<b>Give me that.</b>

07:25.090 --> 07:26.690
<b>Wow!</b>

07:26.690 --> 07:28.050
<b>Let me try.</b>

07:32.000 --> 07:33.180
<b>Like this?</b>

07:35.300 --> 07:36.370
<b>You missed.</b>

07:36.370 --> 07:37.730
<b>Just watch.</b>

07:40.910 --> 07:41.770
<b>H-Hey...</b>

07:41.770 --> 07:43.010
<b>What are you doing?</b>

07:43.550 --> 07:44.150
<b>Hey...</b>

07:44.150 --> 07:45.460
<b>Just as planned!</b>

07:45.460 --> 07:46.150
<b>Nice.</b>

07:46.150 --> 07:48.140
<b>Hey, you'll tear my pants.</b>

07:48.140 --> 07:49.130
<b>Stop it...</b>

07:50.640 --> 07:52.510
<b>See? I caught him.</b>

07:52.510 --> 07:53.280
<b>Yep.</b>

07:53.750 --> 07:55.290
<b>What's that supposed to mean?</b>

07:55.290 --> 07:56.280
<b>I'm a fish now?!</b>

07:56.280 --> 07:58.530
<b>You don't have to get so mad.</b>

07:58.530 --> 08:00.370
<b>It's not like I'm gonna grill and eat you.</b>

08:00.370 --> 08:02.790
<b>Don't mess with me, fool!</b>

08:02.790 --> 08:05.290
<b>Man, I can't even take a nap.</b>

08:12.830 --> 08:14.370
<b>What are you smiling about?</b>

08:14.930 --> 08:16.880
<b>Nothing, really.</b>

08:16.880 --> 08:19.130
<b>You must be up to something again.</b>

08:19.130 --> 08:20.680
<b>Of course not.</b>

08:20.680 --> 08:22.850
<b>I just want to spend</b>

08:22.850 --> 08:25.020
<b>the rest of my time here peacefully.</b>

08:25.020 --> 08:26.270
<b>Liar!</b>

08:26.270 --> 08:28.820
<b>I don't trust you, got it?</b>

08:30.670 --> 08:32.700
<b><i>The feeling's mutual.</i></b>

08:48.820 --> 08:51.140
<b>Yes, the goal!</b>

08:54.180 --> 08:56.470
<b>Pokkle, applicant #53.</b>

08:56.470 --> 08:59.240
<b>Goz, applicant #371.</b>

08:59.240 --> 09:01.350
<b>Both arrived simultaneously.</b>

09:01.350 --> 09:04.480
<b>Total time, thirty hours 
and four minutes.</b>

09:04.480 --> 09:05.450
<b>Damn.</b>

09:05.450 --> 09:06.580
<b>Old timer...</b>

09:06.580 --> 09:10.080
<b>In a tie, the applicant with 
the lower number wins.</b>

09:12.880 --> 09:16.110
<b><i>These guys must be very skilled.</i></b>

09:17.370 --> 09:20.120
<b><i>I would love to fight them eventually.</i></b>

09:54.840 --> 09:56.690
<b><i>You lost,</i></b>

09:56.690 --> 10:00.220
<b><i>squandering fifty of our remaining hours.</i></b>

10:01.030 --> 10:04.070
<b><i>Take some responsibility, huh?</i></b>

11:15.100 --> 11:16.530
<b>Ow!</b>

11:25.780 --> 11:27.780
<b>One more hour...</b>

11:47.390 --> 11:51.060
<b>Sommy, applicant #118,

11:51.060 --> 11:55.560
<b>Total time, sixty-one hours

11:56.310 --> 11:59.220
<b>Man, still ten hours left?</b>

11:59.220 --> 12:01.200
<b>I finished too early.</b>

12:08.130 --> 12:09.080
<b>Okay...</b>

12:09.080 --> 12:10.700
<b>Ready to go!</b>

12:12.460 --> 12:13.950
<b>One more minute.</b>

12:15.830 --> 12:18.700
<b>This is one long minute.</b>

12:25.290 --> 12:25.990
<b>Ah...</b>

12:25.990 --> 12:27.310
<b>Wait up, Gon!</b>

12:31.100 --> 12:41.190
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

12:37.060 --> 12:41.190
<b>Bored</b>

12:54.300 --> 12:57.170
<b>Thirty minutes of running, 
just to end up where we started.</b>

12:57.170 --> 12:59.960
<b>We should have taken those stairs down.</b>

12:59.960 --> 13:01.140
<b>Shut up!</b>

13:01.140 --> 13:03.470
<b>We all agreed on this route!</b>

13:17.940 --> 13:20.590
<b>Man, I'm covered in dust.</b>

13:20.590 --> 13:22.520
<b>H-Hurry up.</b>

13:22.520 --> 13:25.360
<b>We only have an hour left...</b>

13:27.260 --> 13:29.870
<b>We're supposed to vote on 
whether to open the door?</b>

13:30.510 --> 13:33.940
<b>We need to move on. So obviously, 
we want to open the door.</b>

13:39.100 --> 13:40.830
<b>I've had enough of your crap.</b>

13:40.830 --> 13:43.380
<b>Wait, I pressed O.</b>

13:43.380 --> 13:44.800
<b>Don't lie...</b>

13:44.800 --> 13:48.010
<b>You specialize in ruining 
other people's chances!</b>

13:48.010 --> 13:49.710
<b>Sorry, Leorio.</b>

13:49.710 --> 13:50.650
<b>Eh?</b>

13:50.650 --> 13:52.950
<b>I accidentally pressed the wrong button.</b>

13:52.950 --> 13:54.020
<b>What?</b>

13:56.240 --> 13:57.720
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

13:57.720 --> 13:58.520
<b>Wait.</b>

13:58.950 --> 13:59.980
<b>Huh?</b>

13:59.980 --> 14:02.550
<b>You owe me an apology.</b>

14:02.550 --> 14:04.880
<b>I can't let that slide.</b>

14:06.150 --> 14:07.990
<b>It's your own fault,</b>

14:07.990 --> 14:10.530
<b>for doing things to make me distrust you.</b>

14:10.530 --> 14:13.310
<b>I don't owe you anything.</b>

14:13.310 --> 14:15.070
<b>You make it sound like I'm to blame</b>

14:15.070 --> 14:17.290
<b>for everything that's gone wrong.</b>

14:17.840 --> 14:18.790
<b>What?</b>

14:18.790 --> 14:20.920
<b>Have you forgotten</b>

14:20.920 --> 14:23.840
<b>who cost us those fifty hours?</b>

14:23.840 --> 14:26.800
<b>You're the one who made 
a critical mistake.</b>

14:28.610 --> 14:29.940
<b>Hey, Leorio...</b>

14:29.940 --> 14:31.220
<b>Shut up, Kurapika!</b>

14:35.300 --> 14:37.040
<b>Stop this, guys.</b>

14:37.040 --> 14:39.770
<b>It's my fault for pressing 
the wrong button.</b>

14:40.880 --> 14:42.370
<b>Stupid.</b>

14:42.370 --> 14:43.860
<b>I'm moving on.</b>

14:44.450 --> 14:45.730
<b>Wait, Killua!</b>

14:46.530 --> 14:47.690
<b>Hey, Gon...</b>

14:47.690 --> 14:49.610
<b>We're getting close to the goal.</b>

14:49.610 --> 14:51.870
<b>What? Really?</b>

14:55.610 --> 14:57.460
<b>Let's see...</b>

14:57.460 --> 15:01.010
<b>"This will be the last decision 
made by majority rule.</b>

15:01.010 --> 15:03.000
<b>Are you ready?</b>

15:03.000 --> 15:04.390
<b>Choose O or X."</b>

15:04.390 --> 15:05.380
<b>That's it.</b>

15:05.920 --> 15:07.850
<b>Am I ready?</b>

15:07.850 --> 15:09.380
<b>You bet.</b>

15:10.880 --> 15:11.930
<b>Bastard...</b>

15:11.930 --> 15:12.830
<b>Stop!</b>

15:12.830 --> 15:14.390
<b>We don't have time to argue about this!</b>

15:15.830 --> 15:18.780
<b>Please select a path.</b>

15:18.780 --> 15:20.020
<b>There are two choices.</b>

15:20.720 --> 15:22.110
<b>One path allows five to pass,</b>

15:22.110 --> 15:23.940
<b>but is long and difficult.</b>

15:23.940 --> 15:26.770
<b>The other path allows only three,</b>

15:26.770 --> 15:28.730
<b>but is short and easy.</b>

15:32.250 --> 15:34.930
<b>Incidentally, the long and difficult path</b>

15:34.930 --> 15:38.910
<b>requires a minimum of forty-five hours.</b>

15:39.990 --> 15:42.180
<b>The short and easy path leads</b>

15:42.180 --> 15:45.230
<b>to the goal in approximately three minutes.</b>

15:45.920 --> 15:48.550
<b>Press O for the long and difficult path,</b>

15:48.550 --> 15:51.800
<b>and X for the short and easy path.</b>

15:52.890 --> 15:54.150
<b>If X is selected,</b>

15:54.150 --> 15:57.940
<b>two people must be secured to 
the wall with handcuffs,</b>

15:57.940 --> 15:59.530
<b>before the door will open.</b>

16:00.200 --> 16:01.620
<b>The two chained members</b>

16:01.620 --> 16:04.440
<b>will be unable to move until 
the time limit expires.</b>

16:08.200 --> 16:09.940
<b>The examiners were very prepared.</b>

16:10.410 --> 16:11.810
<b>I think they have</b>

16:11.810 --> 16:14.700
<b>every weapon under the sun here.</b>

16:15.240 --> 16:17.100
<b>Two out of five...</b>

16:17.100 --> 16:20.830
<b>So we're supposed to fight, 
to decide the three who pass?</b>

16:21.200 --> 16:24.150
<b>Let me make this clear.</b>

16:25.220 --> 16:26.710
<b>I'm going to press X.</b>

16:27.200 --> 16:29.340
<b>But I have no intention of staying behind.</b>

16:29.340 --> 16:33.340
<b>I'll do whatever it takes to 
be one of the three...</b>

16:34.550 --> 16:36.350
<b>You're shameless.</b>

16:36.890 --> 16:38.670
<b>Had you not wasted fifty hours,</b>

16:38.670 --> 16:40.720
<b>we could have taken the long path.</b>

16:40.720 --> 16:44.480
<b>Shouldn't you take responsibility 
and stay behind?</b>

16:45.130 --> 16:45.770
<b>What?!</b>

16:45.770 --> 16:48.170
<b>I'm sure everyone else agrees!</b>

16:48.170 --> 16:50.830
<b>Have I said anything inaccurate?</b>

16:50.830 --> 16:52.360
<b>Hold on.</b>

16:53.150 --> 16:55.000
<b>I'm going to press O.</b>

16:55.640 --> 16:58.860
<b>We made it all the way here together.</b>

16:58.860 --> 17:00.160
<b>I want us all to pass together.</b>

17:00.870 --> 17:01.840
<b>Gon...</b>

17:01.840 --> 17:04.100
<b>Even if it's a big risk,</b>

17:04.100 --> 17:05.920
<b>I want to give it a shot!</b>

17:06.450 --> 17:07.660
<b>Come on...</b>

17:07.660 --> 17:09.800
<b>You can't really call this a risk.</b>

17:09.800 --> 17:11.670
<b>We have less than an hour.</b>

17:13.720 --> 17:16.480
<b>Gon, there's only one choice</b>

17:16.480 --> 17:18.510
<b>if you want to pass this exam.</b>

17:20.180 --> 17:22.680
<b>There you have it.</b>

17:23.150 --> 17:26.110
<b>Now we have to decide how to 
choose which three pass.</b>

17:26.750 --> 17:28.140
<b>Well, I'm planning on</b>

17:28.140 --> 17:30.440
<b>two of them being you and me.</b>

17:33.870 --> 17:36.950
<b><i>Heh, I've made it this far.</i></b>

17:36.950 --> 17:39.860
<b><i>I won't fail now.</i></b>

17:39.860 --> 17:41.990
<b><i>Whoever makes the first move wins.</i></b>

17:45.360 --> 17:50.460
<b><i>Must we really fight amongst ourselves?</i></b>

17:53.400 --> 17:54.840
<b>Tonpa, that was dirty!</b>

17:54.840 --> 17:56.510
<b>In a fight,</b>

17:56.510 --> 17:58.800
<b>there's no such thing as dirty!</b>

18:02.540 --> 18:04.060
<b>Bastard!</b>

18:04.060 --> 18:06.140
<b>Stop this, you two!</b>

18:06.140 --> 18:08.310
<b>Come on... Let's do it together.</b>

18:08.310 --> 18:10.520
<b>Before we start fighting,</b>

18:10.520 --> 18:12.190
<b>we have to choose O or X!</b>

18:13.640 --> 18:15.220
<b>It's too late for that!</b>

18:17.730 --> 18:19.990
<b>Time to put you in your place!</b>

18:20.460 --> 18:23.370
<b>Right back at you.</b>

18:23.750 --> 18:26.030
<b>Seems our only choice is to fight.</b>

18:29.050 --> 18:30.380
<b><i>What should I do?</i></b>

18:37.090 --> 18:38.880
<b>Three minutes remain.</b>

18:41.140 --> 18:43.250
<b>It's finally over...</b>

18:43.250 --> 18:45.970
<b>Yeah, that took forever.</b>

18:55.800 --> 18:59.870
<b>Made it in time...</b>

19:03.540 --> 19:04.910
<b>He's dead.</b>

19:04.910 --> 19:06.860
<b>The fool.</b>

19:06.860 --> 19:08.690
<b>Better to live and try again,</b>

19:08.690 --> 19:11.190
<b>than to pass and die.</b>

19:11.190 --> 19:13.290
<b>One minute remains.</b>

19:14.030 --> 19:18.220
<b>Looks like it'll just be 
the nineteen here.</b>

19:37.750 --> 19:41.650
<b>Kurapika, applicant #404, 
is the twentieth to pass.</b>

19:41.650 --> 19:45.410
<b>Killua, applicant #99, 
is the twenty-first to pass.</b>

19:45.840 --> 19:49.360
<b>Gon, applicant #405, 
is the twenty-second to pass.</b>

19:50.070 --> 19:54.170
<b>Total time, seventy-one hours 
and fifty-nine minutes.</b>

19:54.170 --> 19:56.650
<b>My butt hurts...</b>

19:56.650 --> 19:58.830
<b>I didn't expect a slide</b>

19:58.830 --> 20:01.590
<b>for the short and easy path.</b>

20:01.590 --> 20:03.940
<b>Three of them...</b>

20:04.670 --> 20:06.350
<b>Thirty seconds remain.</b>

20:06.350 --> 20:09.220
<b>That was really close.</b>

20:09.220 --> 20:11.320
<b>My hands are covered with blisters.</b>

20:11.320 --> 20:12.730
<b>Same here.</b>

20:13.850 --> 20:17.700
<b>Leorio, applicant #403, 
is the twenty-third to pass.</b>

20:18.160 --> 20:21.490
<b>Tonpa, applicant #16, 
is the twenty-fourth to pass.</b>

20:22.090 --> 20:26.240
<b>Total time, seventy-one hours 
and fifty-nine minutes.</b>

20:27.520 --> 20:29.350
<b>My hands are blistered,</b>

20:29.350 --> 20:32.120
<b>but all five of us cleared 
the tower together.</b>

20:32.120 --> 20:34.310
<b>All thanks to Gon!</b>

20:53.740 --> 20:56.290
<b>We entered the long and difficult path.</b>

20:56.290 --> 20:58.210
<b>Then cut a hole in the wall,</b>

20:58.210 --> 21:01.030
<b>to sneak into the short and easy path.</b>

21:01.030 --> 21:02.600
<b>Man, I can't believe</b>

21:02.600 --> 21:04.830
<b>you actually came up with 
that idea on the spot.</b>

21:05.920 --> 21:09.160
<b>I realized that we could break 
the walls, using the weapons.</b>

21:09.740 --> 21:12.160
<b>But it took over fifty minutes.</b>

21:12.700 --> 21:14.840
<b><i>In an extreme situation,</i></b>

21:14.840 --> 21:16.670
<b><i>you were able to calmly evaluate</i></b>

21:16.670 --> 21:18.920
<b><i>our two options and circumvent them.</i></b>

21:19.380 --> 21:22.420
<b><i>That's what makes you special.</i></b>

21:25.070 --> 21:27.450
<b>The Third Phase of the exam is over.</b>

21:27.450 --> 21:30.140
<b>Twenty-five applicants have passed.</b>

21:30.140 --> 21:32.390
<b>One has died.</b>

21:37.000 --> 21:39.580
<b>Though the team members 
had their differences,</b>

21:40.050 --> 21:42.940
<b>Gon was able to bring them together, 
to overcome the trial.</b>

21:44.620 --> 21:47.450
<b>However, a friend today may 
become a foe tomorrow.</b>

21:48.080 --> 21:50.900
<b>Gon doesn't know that before long,</b>

21:50.900 --> 21:52.990
<b>they'll be pitted</b>

21:52.990 --> 21:56.370
<b>against each other, 
in brutal, individual battles.</b>

23:28.910 --> 23:31.460
<b>Next time: Letter x From x Gon!</b>

23:31.460 --> 23:32.850
<b>Now I'm worried.</b>

23:32.850 --> 23:33.890
<b>Because of me?</b>
