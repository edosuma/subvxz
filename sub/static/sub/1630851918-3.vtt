WEBVTT

00:29.763 --> 00:31.798
[Mat] Are you suffering

00:50.250 --> 00:51.151
[Mat groans]

01:19.712 --> 01:21.514
[Monika] Neglect of

01:21.614 --> 01:24.117
lack of motivation,

01:24.184 --> 01:26.586
sleeplessness, lack of appetite,

01:26.686 --> 01:28.855
self-doubt, weight loss,

01:28.922 --> 01:31.191
absence of social contacts,

01:33.159 --> 01:34.561
Stage four is complete.

01:38.832 --> 01:39.766
[Mat sighs]

01:40.800 --> 01:42.635
[Monika] It's as I described

01:43.203 --> 01:45.438
The case is developing

01:45.505 --> 01:47.373
but the realization

01:47.440 --> 01:48.975
has not yet occurred to him.

01:49.042 --> 01:51.611
To be precise, the acceptance

01:51.678 --> 01:53.279
has also not yet taken place.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.919
He refuses to accept that he has

02:00.386 --> 02:03.523
How much longer do you need and why

02:03.590 --> 02:06.359
Probably a combination of the

02:06.426 --> 02:09.696
Are there any more symptoms you

02:09.762 --> 02:12.332
- I want to restrict social contacts.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.235
But, um, even more.

02:15.335 --> 02:18.571
I believe with MB24031987DEB,

02:18.638 --> 02:20.507
we should utilize

02:21.307 --> 02:23.276
But that's... I mean...

02:23.376 --> 02:26.613
Can she even get permission

02:26.679 --> 02:32.118
We're dealing here with a discrepancy

02:34.687 --> 02:35.922
It's taking too long.

02:38.558 --> 02:40.393
In the end, none of us wants

02:40.493 --> 02:42.162
to be passed on to

02:44.831 --> 02:45.832
[she sighs]

02:48.535 --> 02:49.702
[man] We're finished here.

02:52.705 --> 02:54.407
I get to go to

02:56.643 --> 02:57.644
Sorry, my case.

03:09.389 --> 03:10.323
[knock at door]

03:11.157 --> 03:12.192
[David] Mat?

03:13.393 --> 03:14.327
[knock at door]

03:14.894 --> 03:15.862
Are you awake, Mat?

03:17.864 --> 03:18.798
[Mat groans]

03:23.403 --> 03:24.804
Morning.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.272
[Mat groans loudly]

03:38.151 --> 03:40.653
[retches and coughs]

03:42.455 --> 03:43.489
Is he... is he dead?

03:44.157 --> 03:45.525
Maybe we should call a doctor.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.827
- [coughs]

03:47.927 --> 03:48.928
He's just pretending.

03:49.529 --> 03:52.932
And it stinks because he doesn't

03:52.999 --> 03:54.534
[David continues coughing]

03:56.035 --> 03:57.370
Fuck you too, Astrid.

03:59.439 --> 04:01.241
That's nothing but the truth, Mat.

04:01.307 --> 04:03.209
But you never have liked

04:03.276 --> 04:04.644
[Mat groans]

04:05.912 --> 04:06.846
Eugh!

04:08.815 --> 04:11.884
Hey, uh... maybe you need

04:11.951 --> 04:13.953
I can wait outside for you

04:14.520 --> 04:16.255
freshen up or wash or anything.

04:16.322 --> 04:17.223
No, I'm fine.

04:17.824 --> 04:20.893
[David] I've got excellent news

04:20.960 --> 04:22.195
You will explode with glee.

04:22.929 --> 04:23.930
Are you ready for it?

04:25.632 --> 04:27.400
I got you booked for a concert,

04:27.467 --> 04:28.568
[horn toots]

04:31.304 --> 04:32.505
Why?

04:32.605 --> 04:34.007
But... [chuckles]

04:34.073 --> 04:36.943
Why "why"? You're a performer,

04:37.043 --> 04:38.745
Man, you belong on the stage.

04:39.912 --> 04:41.614
Hey, it's a festival.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.717
Crazy, totally cool, a lot

04:44.784 --> 04:47.320
The place to be, fresh.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.623
You'll be performing for a whole month

04:50.723 --> 04:51.891
as their top act.

04:52.759 --> 04:56.362
Well, together with some others,

04:56.929 --> 04:58.164
There's even a green room.

04:59.165 --> 05:01.768
- You might have to share that maybe...

05:03.269 --> 05:06.639
...with one, but not more

05:06.706 --> 05:07.640
[groans]

05:09.909 --> 05:12.512
Drinks for free, food galore

05:12.612 --> 05:14.247
media, media, media.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.616
There'll be some serious

05:16.683 --> 05:19.485
Only one month and all your debts

05:19.552 --> 05:20.553
Isn't that genius?

05:21.888 --> 05:22.889
Debts? What do you mean?

05:24.190 --> 05:25.792
Uh... from Bangkok.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.531
The hotel room, the police,

05:32.265 --> 05:35.868
The 35,000 euros I borrowed from my

05:35.968 --> 05:38.971
Yeah. So, you owe your parents

05:41.841 --> 05:43.676
- Yeah.

05:44.410 --> 05:46.512
Enough is enough. The poor guy

05:46.612 --> 05:48.848
You should shut up

05:48.915 --> 05:50.850
'cause you won't leave me

05:50.917 --> 05:54.153
- Why are you yelling at me? I'm just...

05:57.023 --> 05:59.425
[distant horn blares]

05:59.525 --> 06:01.694
- Okay...

06:02.628 --> 06:03.730
I see.

06:03.796 --> 06:05.932
Mat, are you feeling all right?

06:05.998 --> 06:09.035
So, it has nothing to do with you

06:09.135 --> 06:11.571
who blames the rest of the world

06:11.637 --> 06:12.839
- You're acting...

06:14.974 --> 06:16.743
Okay, I... I'm sorry.

06:17.510 --> 06:18.611
Sorry, I can't.

06:19.479 --> 06:20.413
[sighs]

06:22.315 --> 06:23.983
Look, I don't have the energy,

06:25.318 --> 06:26.252
Okay.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.789
I understand that, really.

06:34.293 --> 06:35.294
I'll be going.

06:36.963 --> 06:37.864
Yeah.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.039
[door opens]

06:50.076 --> 06:51.811
[door closes]

06:51.878 --> 06:52.812
[Mat] Why?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.950
- What, "why?"

06:59.152 --> 07:00.286
What do you mean?

07:01.854 --> 07:03.322
You're... you're destroying me.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.201
Uh...

07:20.873 --> 07:21.974
Are you okay?

07:43.429 --> 07:44.363
[beep]

07:44.997 --> 07:46.966
Archive of Feelings.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.171
Down there, it's not that often

07:52.238 --> 07:53.906
that they have someone

08:17.563 --> 08:18.564
[woman clears throat]

08:30.643 --> 08:31.544
Yeah, well...

08:32.144 --> 08:34.347
Whoo! It's my first visit.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.049
- It seems to be...

08:37.116 --> 08:38.684
Yeah, of course. I'm sorry.

08:43.789 --> 08:44.724
[bell rings]

09:18.224 --> 09:19.792
[woman clears throat loudly]

09:38.044 --> 09:39.745
[Monika] Case file: Marie Schmidt.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.771
Case file: Mathew Benvenuti.

10:05.838 --> 10:08.007
Pre-existing conditions: none.

11:13.973 --> 11:17.410
[woman 1] I find it unfortunate that

11:17.476 --> 11:19.111
Why is that so? Is my...

11:19.712 --> 11:20.646
Ah!

11:22.214 --> 11:23.482
New arrival?

11:24.950 --> 11:26.052
I knew it.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.354
- What do you mean, you knew?

11:28.454 --> 11:30.723
Excusez- moi. I was speaking.

11:30.790 --> 11:31.791
I'm sorry, Ophelia.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.827
I believe we have enough time...

11:35.961 --> 11:38.264
to greet a newcomer

11:48.607 --> 11:50.076
[door creaks]

11:53.546 --> 11:54.480
Please, sit down.

12:03.856 --> 12:04.757
[coughs] May I?

12:06.792 --> 12:07.727
Hello.

12:08.494 --> 12:09.762
My name is Ophelia.

12:10.830 --> 12:15.167
I am a melancholia and I am

12:15.234 --> 12:16.902
[all] Hello, Ophelia.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.406
I am Jona.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.608
I'm a personality disorder.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.744
Narcissism, to be precise.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.848
And I'm fur... I am furious.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.550
I am quite furious and I hate...

12:33.185 --> 12:34.520
And I hate my case.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.055
[all] Hello, Jona.

12:38.090 --> 12:38.991
I am Fiona.

12:40.793 --> 12:41.994
Panic disorder.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.930
I haven't kept enough distance

12:46.432 --> 12:51.971
And I'm glad that F32.1-2011/01

12:52.671 --> 12:54.073
[all] Hello, Fiona.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.009
I am Bruno.

12:58.344 --> 13:02.148
I am a post-traumatic...

13:02.248 --> 13:03.349
Um...

13:04.350 --> 13:07.319
And I admit to having felt empathy

13:08.187 --> 13:09.522
[all] Hello, Bruno.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.531
[Monika sighs]

13:18.597 --> 13:19.598
I am...

13:20.366 --> 13:21.634
wrong here.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.068
And, um, I have to...

14:01.974 --> 14:02.875
Ah...

14:07.279 --> 14:08.247
I miss her.

14:09.114 --> 14:10.049
Hmm?

14:11.750 --> 14:12.685
I miss Susa.

14:15.487 --> 14:16.388
Is that so?

14:19.024 --> 14:20.359
I miss talking to her.

14:20.426 --> 14:21.427
[he chuckles softly]

14:23.362 --> 14:24.363
The way she smells.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.435
Yeah, that I can believe.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.077
Things were better with Susa.

14:40.012 --> 14:41.080
They were, right?

14:43.883 --> 14:44.783
Totally.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.653
I mean, she really loved me.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.923
She inspired me to write songs.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.592
- You were much more successful then.

14:54.493 --> 14:57.563
And I was strong. I... I...

14:58.063 --> 15:00.766
Didn't have to live with your

15:00.833 --> 15:02.134
Abso-fucking-lutely!

15:02.968 --> 15:05.004
Yeah, I mean, sex was great.

15:05.604 --> 15:08.641
I did a lot of sports, I even went

15:09.208 --> 15:10.509
Except in the end when...

15:11.510 --> 15:13.012
Everything was better with Susa.

15:13.646 --> 15:14.546
[Monika] Hmm...

15:16.015 --> 15:16.916
Give her a call.

15:20.886 --> 15:21.887
That's what I'll do.

15:22.554 --> 15:25.758
I have to talk to her and there's

15:25.824 --> 15:26.926
Don't worry.

15:26.992 --> 15:29.361
Yeah, 'cause love is so much

15:30.396 --> 15:32.464
I mean... love...

15:33.132 --> 15:34.333
love is like a force.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.603
No, no, no, love is...

15:37.670 --> 15:40.072
love is like spreading wings.

15:40.172 --> 15:42.875
No, no, no, love is like

15:42.975 --> 15:44.076
It makes you free like...

15:44.843 --> 15:47.413
And she, Susa, she's the wind

15:48.080 --> 15:49.615
Fuck, I need to write

15:50.215 --> 15:52.284
- Um, oh...

15:54.887 --> 15:56.922
Um... so what did I say?

15:56.989 --> 15:57.923
"Love mounts eagles."

16:00.092 --> 16:01.393
No, that doesn't sound right.

16:04.096 --> 16:06.131
Love is like a falcon. Love is...

16:06.198 --> 16:07.232
Love is like a falcon.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.969
Love is power.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.241
Susa is love.

16:17.076 --> 16:18.510
[breathes deeply]

16:19.511 --> 16:20.512
I got goosebumps.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.716
Susa is...

16:23.782 --> 16:25.651
So, now what is your plan?

16:33.025 --> 16:34.326
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

16:35.627 --> 16:36.628
Wow!

16:37.329 --> 16:39.264
- Oh!

16:41.600 --> 16:43.469
I'm going to ask her to marry me.

16:45.104 --> 16:46.605
And everything will be good.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.440
[panting]

16:48.507 --> 16:49.441
And don't...

16:50.209 --> 16:51.643
- Don't try to stop me.

17:01.053 --> 17:02.654
[Monika sighs]

17:12.798 --> 17:14.199
[music playing in background]

17:17.803 --> 17:18.704
You're looking good.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.107
Thanks.

17:24.009 --> 17:25.310
Why parsley?

17:25.411 --> 17:28.647
She told me, if I ever want to bring

17:29.615 --> 17:31.950
- So... [chuckles]

17:34.953 --> 17:36.722
[sighs] Okay...

17:36.789 --> 17:38.390
I see what you're trying to do.

17:38.490 --> 17:41.026
You want me to doubt myself,

17:41.126 --> 17:43.729
- No.

17:43.796 --> 17:47.132
That's not what I want. I think it's

17:47.199 --> 17:49.034
Getting married is also wonderful.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.270
Intimacy, sex with only

17:51.370 --> 17:54.006
- I think it's wonderful.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.308
No. Stop talking to me.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.944
- You know what it is? I'm just...

17:59.044 --> 18:01.213
Remember last time, that didn't

18:02.114 --> 18:03.849
I'm having a conversation,

18:04.783 --> 18:05.951
Ugh!

18:06.552 --> 18:08.454
Aagh! Fuck!

18:12.624 --> 18:13.559
Yeah.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.762
Thank you.

18:20.199 --> 18:21.266
I think I'll miss you.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.170
No, you won't.

18:27.206 --> 18:28.307
[Mat chuckles softly]

18:43.522 --> 18:44.623
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.127
You're looking great.

18:48.727 --> 18:49.628
Fantastic,

18:50.429 --> 18:51.363
like always.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.767
[chuckles]

18:57.870 --> 18:58.804
Thank you.

19:14.853 --> 19:16.355
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.792
And I realized, um, how much

19:22.294 --> 19:25.164
[sighs] I was a real dickhead.

19:26.732 --> 19:29.234
And I know that I don't want to

19:30.569 --> 19:32.404
- Mat, I...

19:32.905 --> 19:34.840
I know I don't deserve

19:35.641 --> 19:38.010
And you never deserved anything

19:38.076 --> 19:39.545
but I am... I'm a new man.

19:39.645 --> 19:40.879
- I've changed.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.550
What?

19:45.984 --> 19:47.085
[chuckles softly]

19:47.786 --> 19:49.188
[chuckles softly]

19:49.288 --> 19:50.189
Hey!

19:52.624 --> 19:54.960
I wanted to tell you about it

19:56.528 --> 19:57.729
didn't work out.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.034
Uh, um...

20:05.671 --> 20:07.172
I've been thinking a lot too...

20:09.074 --> 20:10.008
about you

20:10.809 --> 20:12.945
and about us and...

20:13.645 --> 20:14.913
Also a lot about me.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.884
About why I closed my eyes

20:19.718 --> 20:21.887
why I went along with it

20:23.255 --> 20:26.725
Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying

20:28.560 --> 20:30.229
I should have thrown you out

20:31.029 --> 20:35.000
[chuckles] No idea. I think I just

20:35.567 --> 20:37.603
everything could go back

20:38.704 --> 20:41.673
- when you were really in love with me.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.041
Back when we were happy.

20:46.845 --> 20:49.448
Of course, you can come to

20:53.318 --> 20:55.687
- Susa, I...

20:56.555 --> 20:57.489
I've met someone.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.224
What the fuck!

20:59.324 --> 21:00.492
It's still pretty new.

21:01.293 --> 21:03.028
Uh... I like him.

21:03.128 --> 21:04.263
He's good for me.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.567
I wanted you to hear it from me.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.037
Right.

21:22.547 --> 21:23.849
[sighs]

21:23.915 --> 21:24.850
[horn toots]

21:29.388 --> 21:30.489
She didn't gain weight,

21:30.555 --> 21:33.191
- she's pregnant.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.192
- Huh?

21:35.327 --> 21:37.129
Look, I'm done listening to you.

21:37.195 --> 21:39.164
I'm done letting you put me down

21:41.466 --> 21:43.268
I may be an asshole for cheating

21:43.368 --> 21:45.003
but I'm not the scum you make me

21:45.871 --> 21:47.873
- Okay, I agree, but...

21:49.041 --> 21:51.943
- [woman] Psychotherapeutic practice...

21:52.044 --> 21:54.746
My name is Mat Benvenuti. I need

21:54.846 --> 21:57.115
- You mean with Mr. Sellinger?

21:57.215 --> 21:59.151
- What was your name?

21:59.251 --> 22:02.387
Mr. Benvenuti, how about tomorrow

22:03.088 --> 22:04.556
- That's awesome.

22:04.656 --> 22:05.824
I'll be there. Thanks.

22:07.926 --> 22:08.827
You're done.

22:20.405 --> 22:23.308
She insults me. She won't

22:23.408 --> 22:24.810
I... can't have sex.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.413
I can't even get hard anymore.

22:29.614 --> 22:31.049
Oh, God, she's fucking up my life.

22:31.717 --> 22:34.519
Honestly, the pregnancy thing

22:34.586 --> 22:36.355
When was the first time

22:41.026 --> 22:42.194
In the bed.

22:42.794 --> 22:46.665
Interesting. Any special events

22:46.765 --> 22:49.167
Relationship? Career?

22:49.234 --> 22:51.403
- No. No, nothing.

22:53.638 --> 22:55.574
I had moved in with my girlfriend.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.542
- Ex- girlfriend.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.412
[clears throat] Would you say

23:00.479 --> 23:01.880
moving in with your girlfriend?

23:01.947 --> 23:04.349
I don't know. I just know

23:04.449 --> 23:07.185
- So, could we please talk about her?

23:07.285 --> 23:08.754
[sighs] No, no, no. No, no.

23:08.854 --> 23:10.789
- Susa is my girlfriend.

23:13.325 --> 23:16.027
Uh, my ex... girlfriend.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.397
So, uh, who is Monika?

23:20.866 --> 23:21.800
Her.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.470
Yeah, well...

23:26.805 --> 23:28.807
my niece was the one who gave her

23:29.608 --> 23:33.211
I'm living with them 'cause of

23:33.278 --> 23:35.947
Ah, yes, the video. I remember it.

23:36.047 --> 23:37.215
That was quite successful.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.486
So, you're saying you know me?

23:41.553 --> 23:43.989
Yeah, yeah. I'm a real fan

23:44.089 --> 23:45.424
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

23:45.524 --> 23:47.192
Oh, no, no, no, no...

23:47.292 --> 23:49.127
- Pity you left the group.

23:49.194 --> 23:50.796
[Sellinger] Since then,

23:50.896 --> 23:52.831
- You know, the others...

23:52.931 --> 23:54.433
- I'm not going.

23:54.966 --> 23:56.234
I'm not leaving.

23:56.334 --> 23:59.438
No legitimate therapist gets close

23:59.504 --> 24:01.173
I believe the voice matters.

24:01.239 --> 24:03.508
- I don't care!

24:05.210 --> 24:07.078
[chuckles softly] Nothing. Sorry.

24:07.145 --> 24:08.280
- [Monika] Nothing?

24:08.346 --> 24:11.650
Why nothing? How is that nothing?

24:11.716 --> 24:13.051
- No.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.186
- Go on, ask him.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.487
What is happening?

24:18.023 --> 24:19.558
- Hmm?

24:19.624 --> 24:21.026
Your hallucination?

24:21.126 --> 24:23.295
I am not a hallucination.

24:23.361 --> 24:25.530
She says she's not a hallucination,

24:26.798 --> 24:28.333
- [Sellinger] Yeah.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.169
And what is it she wants,

24:31.870 --> 24:33.705
What's with the quotation marks?

24:33.805 --> 24:36.041
She says to ask if

24:36.908 --> 24:39.878
- Alcohol? Sex? What do you mean?

24:40.645 --> 24:43.114
- Come!

24:43.715 --> 24:44.649
I like him.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.185
Look, he's cool.

24:48.386 --> 24:50.489
- Hmm, he's cool?

24:50.555 --> 24:53.692
Cool? Because that's just what

24:53.758 --> 24:55.227
I definitely don't need you.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.430
Maybe you should go to someone who can

24:58.530 --> 25:01.600
Your depression is telling you to

25:01.666 --> 25:02.767
- Yeah.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.370
- [Sellinger] Is that right?

25:05.437 --> 25:07.772
- Ask about his education.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.241
Hmm, just ask him.

25:09.307 --> 25:12.077
So, what does your, uh, depression

25:12.711 --> 25:15.247
She wants to know where you got

25:15.313 --> 25:16.448
- My degree?

25:18.016 --> 25:19.851
[Sellinger chuckles softly]

25:19.918 --> 25:20.852
[sighs]

25:21.853 --> 25:22.854
After I got divorced,

25:23.722 --> 25:25.557
I sold all my belongings and...

25:26.324 --> 25:27.792
went on a pilgrimage in Spain.

25:28.827 --> 25:32.197
There, I decided to dedicate myself

25:32.764 --> 25:34.966
[together] as I myself was back then.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.735
I've read all the books

25:36.801 --> 25:37.936
Two books.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.639
[Sellinger] Then I took my exam

25:40.705 --> 25:42.707
Yeah, and I've been practicing

25:42.807 --> 25:44.809
Yeah, and I've been practicing

25:45.443 --> 25:46.878
But that has absolutely nothing

25:46.945 --> 25:49.047
to do with becoming a psychotherapist,

25:49.114 --> 25:51.750
- Listen, I have this feeling.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.752
[Sellinger] Your desire

25:53.852 --> 25:55.720
He didn't even go to

25:55.787 --> 25:58.590
Anyone can become a therapist

25:58.690 --> 26:01.092
[Sellinger] Your inner world

26:01.159 --> 26:03.528
- Free yourself from this trap.

26:03.595 --> 26:05.463
[Sellinger] Free yourself

26:05.564 --> 26:06.631
Mat, Mat!

26:06.731 --> 26:09.434
This woman who tells you what

26:09.534 --> 26:12.170
- [Monika sighs]

26:12.237 --> 26:15.707
- [Monika] Of course. Here we go.

26:15.807 --> 26:17.876
And thus some mood swings...

26:19.044 --> 26:23.281
and a touch of melancholia

26:23.348 --> 26:24.783
[scoffs] No reason to worry!

26:25.383 --> 26:27.719
No reason to worry.

26:27.786 --> 26:28.987
Hmm?

26:29.087 --> 26:30.922
Do me a favor and stand up.

26:30.989 --> 26:33.592
- Don't stand. Please don't stand.

26:33.692 --> 26:34.826
Don't breathe with him. Mat!

26:35.794 --> 26:37.095
Oh, God!

26:37.162 --> 26:40.198
Close your eyes. If you simply

26:40.265 --> 26:42.067
- Seriously?

26:42.167 --> 26:43.768
- And out again with a sound.

26:43.835 --> 26:45.103
[breathes deeply]

26:45.203 --> 26:48.673
[both] Uhhhhhhhhh!

26:48.773 --> 26:51.009
[men make babbling sounds]

26:52.544 --> 26:55.814
[Mat] Uh, uh, ah, ah, ah, ah!

26:55.880 --> 26:57.248
- Guys?

26:57.315 --> 26:59.150
- Both of you, stop it.

26:59.250 --> 27:02.120
- I am my own man.

27:02.187 --> 27:04.322
I won't be pushed around

27:04.389 --> 27:06.424
[they make rolling tongue sound]

27:08.393 --> 27:09.327
[Mat sighs]

27:20.305 --> 27:21.239
[chuckles softly]

27:22.273 --> 27:23.608
She's gone.

27:23.675 --> 27:24.609
Of course.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.344
[both] Aaagh!
