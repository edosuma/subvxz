00:01.333 --> 00:03.334
Guys, here she comes.
Get ready.

00:05.270 --> 00:08.206
Mom, my mouth hurts.

00:18.818 --> 00:21.519
You see what happens
when you don't floss?

00:22.655 --> 00:27.325
Hey, all right.
Blood capsules. Cool.

00:27.326 --> 00:29.360
You know what goes
really good with those?

00:29.361 --> 00:30.428
<i>(brad)</i> what?

00:30.429 --> 00:32.195
Hi, baby.
Hi, sweetie.

00:32.197 --> 00:34.833
Pus pellets.
<i>(jill)</i> ew!

00:34.834 --> 00:37.168
I got yellow and green ones,
enough for all you guys,

00:37.169 --> 00:39.370
But don't squeeze 'em
until Halloween.

00:39.371 --> 00:41.305
All right.

00:41.306 --> 00:45.110
Oh, dad. Now we have
all this Halloween junk.

00:45.111 --> 00:49.313
Skeletons, brains
and mummy-wrapping tape.

00:49.314 --> 00:51.916
Gotta have wrapping tape.
You don't want to see
your mummy naked.

00:51.917 --> 00:54.385
Ha-ha-ha-ha. Very funny.

00:54.386 --> 00:57.421
Dad, I don't see
any rubber guts.

00:57.422 --> 01:00.391
How can we have
a Halloween party
without rubber guts?

01:00.392 --> 01:03.394
Let me tell you something,
little mister.

01:03.395 --> 01:06.865
When I was your age,
we didn't have rubber guts.

01:06.866 --> 01:09.600
We had to use real guts.

01:09.601 --> 01:12.671
This is why you're lucky
to have two parents.

01:12.672 --> 01:15.473
I got these from
the rubber-guts catalog.

01:15.474 --> 01:17.308
<i>(boys)</i> all right.

01:17.309 --> 01:21.345
Here's your stomach,
your large intestine,
a spleen, some colon.

01:21.346 --> 01:23.648
Mom, you are too cool.
Thank you, sweetie.

01:23.649 --> 01:25.717
Oh, good! You got
the carrot cake.

01:25.718 --> 01:27.886
They did a great job.
They got those candy corns

01:27.887 --> 01:30.155
In the shape of
jack-o'-lanterns.
Look at this thing.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.422
Aah!

02:44.196 --> 02:46.397
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:52.104 --> 02:55.974
As you can see, with
the binford light oak stain,

02:55.975 --> 02:58.509
You get a nice...

02:58.510 --> 02:59.811
Honey-colored...

02:59.812 --> 03:02.147
<i>(mouths)</i>

03:03.715 --> 03:04.916
...Finish.

03:07.319 --> 03:08.887
That's right, al.

03:08.888 --> 03:11.322
When you're all finished
with this,

03:11.323 --> 03:13.691
You wanna put a thin coat
of binford polyurethane
on there.

03:13.692 --> 03:16.594
Now binford provides this
in an economical
two-gallon size.

03:16.595 --> 03:19.497
Al, you want to pop the top?
Be glad to, tim.

03:19.498 --> 03:21.299
Aah!

03:25.070 --> 03:27.705
Al... Al... Al...

03:27.706 --> 03:31.442
Al... Al.

03:31.443 --> 03:33.444
I can't believe
you fell for

03:33.445 --> 03:35.914
The old "head in
the polyurethane" gag.

03:35.915 --> 03:39.383
I guess
this must mean Halloween
is just around the corner.

03:39.384 --> 03:41.853
Or else you've found
a sick new way

03:41.854 --> 03:44.689
To celebrate
columbus day.

03:44.690 --> 03:47.391
Nope, Halloween.

03:47.392 --> 03:49.360
No, no, no, no, no!

03:52.031 --> 03:55.200
I can see
by the clock on the wall
that we have...

03:55.201 --> 03:56.835
Way too many minutes left.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.537
So we can do a quick
pose-off, al and I.

03:59.538 --> 04:02.040
<i>(imitates schwarzenegger)</i>
come on, maria,
show me your biceps.

04:04.109 --> 04:05.977
Or we could get to
some viewer mail.

04:05.978 --> 04:07.511
Heidi, the mail, please.

04:09.982 --> 04:12.116
Here you go, tim.
This one came with cookies.

04:12.117 --> 04:15.286
Hey. And a rose!

04:15.287 --> 04:17.755
All right.

04:17.755 --> 04:20.892
"dear tim,
I'm your biggest fan.

04:20.892 --> 04:25.596
"I watch you every day
and dream about you
every night.

04:25.597 --> 04:28.299
I hope you like
these cookies I baked."
you bet I will.

04:28.300 --> 04:32.370
"your admirer, rose."
this is the second letter
I've gotten from rose this week.

04:32.371 --> 04:35.240
Did you hear that, al?
She dreams about me every night.

04:35.241 --> 04:37.942
It sounds like
she has a sleeping disorder.

04:47.253 --> 04:50.521
Al, don't be jealous,
don't be jealous.

04:50.522 --> 04:52.857
You'll get some letters one day.
Change your name to "occupant."

04:57.329 --> 04:59.563
That wouldn't
be necessary, tim.

04:59.564 --> 05:01.565
Heidi, my mail, please.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.404
Here you go, al.

05:06.405 --> 05:09.173
Thank you, heidi.
You're welcome.

05:09.174 --> 05:11.742
If tim's face appears green,
don't adjust your tv.

05:11.743 --> 05:14.045
It's just envy.

05:14.046 --> 05:17.382
Yeah, but anybody
can get letters like that.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.183
I got cookies.

05:19.184 --> 05:20.985
Boys!

05:29.828 --> 05:32.630
I really am grateful to you
for helping me with this party.

05:32.631 --> 05:35.533
What else have I got to do?
Joe's out of town.

05:35.534 --> 05:38.602
I can think of a few things
I'd like to do when tim's
out of town.

05:38.603 --> 05:41.306
Like what?
<i>(door closes)</i>

05:41.307 --> 05:42.740
Change the locks.

05:44.143 --> 05:45.776
Hi, honey.

05:47.246 --> 05:49.013
<i>(jill)</i> whoa!

05:51.583 --> 05:54.785
You should start scrubbing
with a stronger soap.

05:57.622 --> 06:00.391
Oh, no. What's gonna
pop out of that?

06:00.392 --> 06:02.493
Nothing. That's
some cookies
a fan made me.

06:02.494 --> 06:05.496
Yeah, right.
You have a fan.

06:07.066 --> 06:10.634
Her name is rose,
and she sent me
two letters this week.

06:10.635 --> 06:12.670
Let's see.
No! Don't touch that.

06:12.671 --> 06:15.974
It's probably full of
slimy eyeballs or something.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.776
Ooh! Cookies! Give me one.
No. You made fun of me.

06:18.777 --> 06:21.012
How about me?
No. You're her friend.

06:22.481 --> 06:23.514
Hey, dad. Hi, mom.

06:23.515 --> 06:25.783
Hey, guys.
Hi, sweetie.

06:25.784 --> 06:27.785
Ooh, nice warts.

06:27.786 --> 06:31.722
Yeah? Wait till you see
what I got your mom.

06:31.723 --> 06:34.592
I got her the biggest,
hairiest mole
they make.

06:34.593 --> 06:36.427
Ooh.

06:36.428 --> 06:39.663
This is gonna go well
with that armpit hair
you gave me last Halloween.

06:39.664 --> 06:40.965
Is that good?

06:40.966 --> 06:43.601
Hey, guys, what are you
gonna be for Halloween?

06:43.602 --> 06:45.470
We're gonna be
the three stooges.

06:45.471 --> 06:48.606
Yes! That's great!

06:48.607 --> 06:51.142
I grew up with those guys.
I love those guys. The stooges.

06:51.143 --> 06:54.278
Moe for his
leadership qualities.

06:54.279 --> 06:56.647
Larry for his quick wit.

06:56.648 --> 06:58.916
Curly for his ability
to go, "whoo-whoo-whoo!"

06:58.917 --> 07:00.318
<i>(both)</i> whoo-whoo-whoo.

07:00.319 --> 07:02.720
Of all the people in the world,
why do you wanna be the stooges?

07:02.721 --> 07:04.722
They're obnoxious,
they're constantly
hitting each other...

07:04.723 --> 07:07.458
It just became clear.

07:07.459 --> 07:12.696
What is it with the stooges?
All men seem to adore them,
even the smart ones.

07:12.697 --> 07:14.832
I don't think
that einstein did.

07:14.833 --> 07:18.202
Are you kidding? Einstein
was a big stooge fan.

07:18.203 --> 07:20.838
Why do you think
he wore his hair
like larry's?

07:25.577 --> 07:28.779
Yeah, that'll work.
That'll scare everybody.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.515
<i>(phone rings)</i>

07:30.516 --> 07:32.150
Oh. Hang in there.

07:36.788 --> 07:38.589
Y-ello. Happy Halloween. Boo.

07:41.326 --> 07:43.428
Rose?

07:43.429 --> 07:46.330
Rose - cookie rose?
Sure, I got the cookies.
Thank you very much.

07:46.331 --> 07:47.432
What?

07:47.433 --> 07:50.034
You're in love with me?

07:50.035 --> 07:52.170
You want me?

07:52.171 --> 07:55.573
It's a gag, jill.
It's not that funny.

07:55.574 --> 07:59.677
Of course you're not jill.
Oh, no. How silly of me.
No, no.

07:59.678 --> 08:01.845
In that case,
I love you, too.

08:01.846 --> 08:05.083
Yes. We should go some...
Alone, alone.

08:06.851 --> 08:09.454
Jill won't know.
Yeah, my wife,
she's real slow.

08:10.789 --> 08:13.224
Excuse me?
Yeah, jill, yeah.

08:13.225 --> 08:15.626
Hi, ji - jill,
you're not on the phone?

08:15.627 --> 08:18.396
And you call me slow?

08:18.397 --> 08:21.099
That means this is rose,
the woman that sent me
the cookies.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.766
She says she wants me.

08:22.767 --> 08:25.636
Tell her she can have you.

08:25.637 --> 08:28.506
You tell her.
You can have him.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.208
Hello? Hello?

08:30.209 --> 08:33.010
There is no one here, tim.
You are so full of it!

08:33.010 --> 08:35.212
Is a little head
gonna pop out of here now?

08:35.214 --> 08:38.316
No. She was
on the phone.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.451
How could she get our number?
It's unlisted.

08:40.452 --> 08:43.020
How the heck do I know?
But rose was on the phone.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.823
Yeah, right. Look, tim,
I know how badly you want a fan.

08:45.824 --> 08:48.659
Just hang in there.
One of these days,
you'll get one.

08:56.435 --> 08:57.502
Hey, wilson.

08:57.503 --> 09:00.037
Hi-dee-ho and boo,
good neighbor.

09:01.706 --> 09:04.675
Hey, let me
ask you a question.

09:04.676 --> 09:07.612
Let's say you wanted
my phone number.
How would you get it?

09:07.613 --> 09:09.680
I already have
your phone number.

09:09.681 --> 09:12.116
I know. What if
you didn't have it?

09:12.117 --> 09:14.252
I suppose I'd just
ask you for it.
What if you didn't know me?

09:14.253 --> 09:16.387
Then why would I
want to call you?

09:18.357 --> 09:21.058
Boy, I wish I was friendly
with some of the other
neighbors around here.

09:21.059 --> 09:22.893
<i>(laughs)</i>

09:24.829 --> 09:27.231
What is troubling you,
my little fence friend?

09:27.232 --> 09:29.267
All right.

09:29.268 --> 09:32.637
I got kind of an odd call
by this woman who sent me
a fan letter at work.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.639
My phone number's
unlisted.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.807
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

09:36.808 --> 09:40.645
That is a concern.
I hope you're not dealing
with an obsessed fan.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.746
No, no, no, no, tim.

09:42.747 --> 09:45.916
Sometimes they see
somebody on tv, they start
idolizing that person.

09:45.917 --> 09:48.419
Sometimes they even
send them gifts.

09:51.356 --> 09:53.357
Like chocolate
macadamia nut cookies?

09:53.358 --> 09:55.660
That's a good and tasty
possibility.

09:55.661 --> 09:59.263
Though I'd be very cautious
about eating anything
that they send.

10:08.807 --> 10:12.310
Oh, marie,
it is going so well.

10:12.311 --> 10:16.247
This is gonna get tim back
for every Halloween prank
he ever pulled on me.

10:16.248 --> 10:18.849
The severed thumb
in my jell-o.

10:18.850 --> 10:21.619
Yeah, the tarantula
in my underwear drawer.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.688
Well, wilson
is in on it, too.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.591
Yeah, yeah.
He's freaking him out
even more.

10:35.934 --> 10:38.135
Tim, I wouldn't
worry about it.

10:38.136 --> 10:41.905
If the cookies were poisoned,
you'd feel the effects by now.

10:41.906 --> 10:47.345
I don't know. I got this
burning-bile feeling
in there now.

10:47.346 --> 10:49.113
You're gonna be fine.

10:49.114 --> 10:52.250
Listen, I'll talk to you
later, marie.

10:52.251 --> 10:53.484
I mean, I should say...

10:53.485 --> 10:55.486
<i>(soft and seductive)</i> rose.

10:55.487 --> 10:58.689
<i>(evil laugh)</i>

10:58.690 --> 10:59.923
Yeah. Bye.

11:10.769 --> 11:12.136
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

11:30.221 --> 11:31.922
Is that you, rose?

11:31.923 --> 11:35.159
Hello.
Nice to see you, too.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.295
Sorry. I thought you were
some crazed wacko.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.930
Oh, I'm just your
run-of-the-mill wacko.

11:39.931 --> 11:43.267
Tim, put the bat down.
I'm so sorry, marie.

11:43.268 --> 11:45.536
Remember that woman
that sent him the cookies?

11:45.537 --> 11:48.339
He's convinced that
she's obsessed with him.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.642
You want some coffee?
Yeah, I'd love some.

11:51.643 --> 11:55.846
Wilson
said sometimes obsessed fans
will send you poisoned food.

11:55.847 --> 11:57.848
Ooh! That's true.

11:57.849 --> 11:59.983
Those cookies
had a lot of butter
in them.

11:59.984 --> 12:02.019
Butter's very high
in cholesterol.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.955
She could be trying
to kill you slowly.

12:04.956 --> 12:08.559
Tim, I got some
jack-o'-lanterns in the car.
Will you get 'em for me?

12:08.560 --> 12:10.060
You bet. Sure.

12:10.061 --> 12:13.964
Unless you are afraid that rose
is hiding in the backseat.

12:13.965 --> 12:16.534
<i>(hisses)</i>

12:16.535 --> 12:19.503
You want some cream
or sugar?
No, thanks.

12:19.504 --> 12:21.772
<i>(door closes)</i>
he really looks nervous.

12:21.773 --> 12:24.375
Yeah, he's a total wreck.
Isn't it great?

12:24.376 --> 12:26.610
It's the very best prank
I've seen

12:26.611 --> 12:29.279
Since we superglued
grandma to the toilet seat.

12:31.216 --> 12:32.282
You what?

12:32.283 --> 12:34.452
Hey, she wasn't
my grandma.

12:34.453 --> 12:35.720
<i>(laughs)</i>

12:35.721 --> 12:38.389
Here he comes.

12:38.390 --> 12:41.091
Jill, I think you should take
this rose thing seriously.

12:41.092 --> 12:43.126
I'm in therapy,
so I know for a fact

12:43.127 --> 12:45.162
There are a lot of nuts
out there.

12:45.163 --> 12:48.766
But why would anyone
be obsessed with tim?

12:48.767 --> 12:51.502
Because I'm very obsessable.

12:51.503 --> 12:55.740
Oh, tim. I'm married to you,
and I barely think about you.

12:57.175 --> 12:59.610
You think this is
real funny, don't you?

12:59.611 --> 13:02.346
There could be a woman out there
fantasizing about me right now.

13:02.347 --> 13:05.916
What is she fantasizing,
that you come over to her house
late at night,

13:05.917 --> 13:08.819
Bring some wine and blow up
her garbage disposal?

13:12.090 --> 13:14.091
Jill, I don't think
you should joke about this.

13:14.092 --> 13:16.126
These people
can be dangerous.

13:16.127 --> 13:18.128
Do you really think so?

13:18.129 --> 13:20.264
I think tim
should watch his step.

13:20.265 --> 13:23.300
Yeah. Thanks.
You're welcome.

13:23.301 --> 13:27.304
Well, maybe you're right.
Tim, I think you should
phone in sick today.

13:27.305 --> 13:32.142
No way. I will not
live my life in fear.

13:32.143 --> 13:33.878
D-oh!

13:38.383 --> 13:40.384
That unkinked my colon.

13:40.385 --> 13:42.019
Get out of the way!

13:46.958 --> 13:48.893
Hey, al.
Tim?

13:48.894 --> 13:51.829
Did you notice whether
there were any women
in the audience today?

13:51.830 --> 13:54.598
I didn't notice,
but there's always a few. Why?

13:54.599 --> 13:57.468
No reason.
Hey, do me a favor.

13:57.469 --> 14:00.504
Would you go out there
and see if any of them
look... Obsessed?

14:01.640 --> 14:03.941
Obsessed?

14:03.942 --> 14:09.146
Yeah. The same look you get
when you're sitting in front
of a plate of pancakes.

14:09.147 --> 14:12.450
And here they are, those
two guys who are no fools
when it comes to tools -

14:12.451 --> 14:14.618
Tim taylor and al borland!

14:14.619 --> 14:16.487
Whoo!

14:16.488 --> 14:18.656
<i>(applause and cheering)</i>

14:20.492 --> 14:24.394
Thank you.
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

14:33.104 --> 14:35.372
Golly, there's a lot of women
in the audience today, heidi.

14:35.373 --> 14:38.208
That's right, tim.
This afternoon, we're
honored to have with us

14:38.209 --> 14:40.744
The women's
sharpshooters club
of detroit!

14:44.082 --> 14:47.184
Well, welcome,
sharpshooters.

14:49.087 --> 14:51.088
I am tim taylor.
This is <i>tool time.</i>

14:51.089 --> 14:53.924
You all know my assistant -
al "bull's-eye" borland.

14:55.660 --> 14:58.028
You know, a lot of people
don't know

14:58.029 --> 15:01.264
That <i>tool time</i> isn't
just about home improvement.

15:02.601 --> 15:05.836
It's also about
frisking people.

15:07.506 --> 15:10.073
Would you take the honors
today, al?

15:10.074 --> 15:12.910
I don't think so, tim.

15:12.911 --> 15:16.580
Today, we're going
to be talking about
insulating windows.

15:16.581 --> 15:18.148
Yes, we are.

15:21.419 --> 15:23.821
Caulking,
window insulation...

15:23.822 --> 15:27.658
And that's all the time we have.
Have a safe drive home.

15:27.659 --> 15:30.628
Tim. Tim! Tim!

15:30.629 --> 15:32.563
Come in to the crowd.
Get the crowd.

15:32.564 --> 15:36.033
I wanna see the whole audience.
Focus. I gotta see the girls
out here.

15:36.034 --> 15:40.604
Tim! We're not gonna
talk about windows,
are we?

15:40.605 --> 15:43.106
Why do we have projects?
Why do we even have a show?

15:43.107 --> 15:45.108
I'm having
a little difficulty...

15:45.109 --> 15:47.645
Tim, I found this.
It was addressed to you.

15:47.646 --> 15:50.147
It's a rose.
Get this outta here.

15:50.148 --> 15:52.917
Men and women
sure react differently
to getting flowers.

15:52.918 --> 15:56.186
You should
at least read it.
I don't wanna read it.

15:56.187 --> 16:00.390
"my dearest tim,
I'm in the front row today.

16:00.391 --> 16:04.662
Tonight, I'll
be even closer when I'm
at your Halloween party."

16:04.663 --> 16:06.931
Great.

16:06.932 --> 16:10.034
"don't reject my affections,
or you'll be sorry. Rose."

16:16.441 --> 16:21.912
Al, don't you think it's mean,
what were doing to tim?

16:21.913 --> 16:23.614
Yes, I do.

16:38.063 --> 16:39.129
Hi, shirl.

16:39.130 --> 16:41.298
It's me - al.

16:41.299 --> 16:43.033
Oh.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.404
Aah!

16:49.741 --> 16:52.943
<i>(♪ spooky)</i>

17:01.586 --> 17:04.421
<i>(screaming)</i>

17:17.268 --> 17:18.736
Excuse me.

17:23.074 --> 17:26.777
Hey, good to see you.
Who is that?

17:26.778 --> 17:28.512
Nice party, tim.
Heidi.

17:28.512 --> 17:32.683
Spooky.
Nice hair. Spooky. Uhh.

17:32.684 --> 17:35.919
Honey, what were you
thinking about when you
picked out these costumes?

17:35.920 --> 17:37.587
A widow and a corpse?

17:37.588 --> 17:39.790
By the time I got there,
there wasn't much left.

17:39.791 --> 17:42.425
It was either a corpse
or bob vila.

17:45.429 --> 17:48.098
What's the difference?

17:48.099 --> 17:51.835
Is it my imagination,
or are we surrounded
by death tonight?

17:51.836 --> 17:54.038
Death was a very hot
costume this year.

17:54.039 --> 17:57.240
Black is very slimming.

17:57.241 --> 18:00.410
Why don't these people
just get dressed up
as licorice?

18:00.411 --> 18:02.079
Honey, will you relax?

18:02.080 --> 18:04.247
Nobody's gonna get by al unless
they're on the guest list.

18:04.248 --> 18:06.349
Oh, yeah,
our crack security ape.

18:06.350 --> 18:09.053
<i>(tim)</i> al? Al.

18:14.425 --> 18:17.027
Hey! Hey!
Banana breath!

18:17.028 --> 18:19.930
You let another fiend
slip by.

18:19.931 --> 18:22.933
Oh, no, that's ok.
That's just reverend mcdonald.

18:22.934 --> 18:24.101
Hi, reverend.

18:25.603 --> 18:26.704
Boy, it's...

18:27.739 --> 18:29.740
...It's hot in there.

18:29.741 --> 18:33.643
Put your mask back on.
You're scaring all the kids.

18:33.644 --> 18:36.847
Just watch the door. Please?
All right, I will.

18:36.848 --> 18:40.918
I'm gonna change that music.
It's too spooky for Halloween.

18:40.919 --> 18:42.052
Aah!

18:43.654 --> 18:45.789
Hello.
Hello.

18:45.790 --> 18:46.857
Hello.

18:46.858 --> 18:49.059
<i>(all)</i> hello!

18:51.562 --> 18:54.364
Wait a minute.
Why did your father
dress you all alike?

18:54.365 --> 18:56.333
We all wanted to be moe.

18:57.936 --> 18:59.903
Spread out, knuckleheads.

19:01.206 --> 19:03.107
Ow!

19:03.108 --> 19:06.744
Oh. Wise guys, eh?

19:06.745 --> 19:08.145
Ohh!
Ohh!

19:08.146 --> 19:10.313
Ow! Ow!

19:10.314 --> 19:12.582
Ow!
Ow!

19:12.583 --> 19:13.784
Ow!

19:13.785 --> 19:16.253
<i>(all)</i> ow!

19:21.893 --> 19:24.694
Hey!
Don't do that, wilson.

19:24.695 --> 19:26.630
I'm sorry, tim.

19:26.631 --> 19:29.332
I didn't mean to frighten you,
but a lady asked me
to give this to you.

19:32.103 --> 19:33.370
It's a rose.

19:33.371 --> 19:35.806
That was
my first reaction.

19:39.177 --> 19:40.244
Where is she?

19:40.245 --> 19:42.612
She seems to have
disappeared.

19:42.613 --> 19:46.516
A lady dressed all in red.
Had an air of menace about her.

19:46.517 --> 19:47.751
Did she?

20:06.004 --> 20:07.004
Uhh.

20:14.212 --> 20:15.279
Oh, boy.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.382
<i>(all)</i> ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

20:22.187 --> 20:24.188
Excuse us
for a minute.

20:24.189 --> 20:25.588
Rose is here.

20:25.589 --> 20:27.291
Rose, the obsessed fan?

20:27.292 --> 20:29.026
No, rose kennedy.

20:30.594 --> 20:32.696
Yes, rose, the obsessed fan!
Where is she?

20:32.697 --> 20:33.797
Right over there.

20:36.100 --> 20:39.569
This is so creepy.

20:39.570 --> 20:42.405
Maybe you should
call the police.
Maybe you're right.

20:42.406 --> 20:44.407
Wait, no!
Don't do it down here.

20:44.408 --> 20:46.476
You'll scare the guests.
Go upstairs.

20:46.477 --> 20:50.180
Promise me one thing.
If anything happens to me,
shoot the ape.

20:53.084 --> 20:54.184
Oww!

21:06.464 --> 21:10.200
Operator?
What's the number for 911?

21:10.201 --> 21:11.268
Slow down.

21:11.269 --> 21:13.370
<i>(knock on door)</i>
jill?

21:13.371 --> 21:16.073
Guess again.
It's rose.

21:17.541 --> 21:19.977
I'll... Be right there.

21:19.978 --> 21:22.612
I'm just going
to fix my face.

21:22.613 --> 21:23.847
Eww.

21:29.653 --> 21:31.654
Come on in. Come on.

21:35.493 --> 21:37.394
Aah!
Trick or treat!

21:37.395 --> 21:40.563
<i>(whooping and laughter)</i>

21:43.968 --> 21:46.069
You look beautiful!

21:46.070 --> 21:48.805
<i>(al)</i> that was a great trick!

21:48.806 --> 21:53.643
The king of Halloween is dead.
Long live the queen.

22:00.184 --> 22:02.552
<i>(♪ romantic)</i>

22:07.125 --> 22:08.858
What's all this stuff?

22:08.859 --> 22:11.561
I thought I'd put
a little romance
back in Halloween.

22:13.431 --> 22:17.935
I've always been attracted
to dead, pasty-faced guys.

22:17.936 --> 22:20.037
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

22:20.038 --> 22:22.372
You better kiss me
before rigor mortis sets in.

22:27.645 --> 22:30.047
Care to dance,
my widow woman?

22:30.048 --> 22:32.950
I'd love to, dead astaire.

22:40.858 --> 22:42.625
Ah.

22:42.626 --> 22:44.894
Nice party.

22:44.895 --> 22:47.130
Spin me, mr. Taylor.
Spin me.

22:47.131 --> 22:48.832
You got it.

22:48.833 --> 22:51.168
Aah!

22:51.169 --> 22:53.636
The king is back!

22:53.637 --> 22:56.106
He's got one arm,
but the king is back.

22:56.107 --> 22:57.140
Thank you.

23:01.812 --> 23:05.349
As you can see, with
the binford light oak stain,

23:05.350 --> 23:07.250
You will get a nice...

23:07.251 --> 23:09.286
Honey-colored...

23:09.287 --> 23:10.320
Finish.

23:11.655 --> 23:14.358
<i>(laughter)</i>

23:14.359 --> 23:16.226
With the binford
light oak stain,

23:16.227 --> 23:19.629
You'll get a nice
honey-colored finish.

23:19.630 --> 23:22.432
That's right. When you're
through with that,

23:22.433 --> 23:24.834
You'll want to put a light,
little <i>(gibberish)</i> on top.

23:24.835 --> 23:26.503
<i>(man)</i> oh...

23:26.504 --> 23:27.570
Oh, what?
