17:10.310 --> 17:12.758
- How much longer do we
have to wait for this dude?

17:13.965 --> 17:15.172
- It's already been
an hour and a half,

17:15.172 --> 17:16.862
but I can wait all
night if I have too.

17:16.862 --> 17:18.379
- You would.

17:18.379 --> 17:19.448
[woman giggles]

17:19.448 --> 17:21.310
- What's that supposed to mean?

17:21.310 --> 17:23.689
- He's saying you're soft.

17:23.689 --> 17:24.896
- Oh I'm soft?

17:29.137 --> 17:31.413
Don't let these looks
fool you sweetheart.

17:32.724 --> 17:34.655
- I've had it with this
waiting around crap?

17:34.655 --> 17:36.655
- Boy, someone is impatient.

17:36.655 --> 17:39.103
- Nah, I just don't like
my time being wasted.

17:39.103 --> 17:40.655
You three can sit
here all night waiting

17:40.655 --> 17:42.172
for the mystery man, I'm done.

17:43.551 --> 17:44.793
- If your time's so
precious then why the hell

17:44.793 --> 17:46.827
did you even bother coming?

17:46.827 --> 17:48.103
- Because he's curious.

17:49.103 --> 17:51.172
- Curious about what?

17:51.172 --> 17:54.448
- Who he is?

17:54.448 --> 17:56.896
None of you know what I know.

17:58.586 --> 17:59.758
- What does that mean?

17:59.758 --> 18:01.482
What do you know, tell me?

18:01.482 --> 18:02.724
- Yes, tell us.

18:10.724 --> 18:12.896
- Where's the fun in that?

18:15.413 --> 18:18.068
[door slamming]

18:24.379 --> 18:26.310
- The hell's this?

18:26.310 --> 18:28.827
- We don't know, we were
hoping that you were Stills.

18:28.827 --> 18:30.034
Who are you?

18:30.034 --> 18:32.241
- None of your damn
business who I am.

18:32.241 --> 18:33.517
- There's no need
for the attitude.

18:33.517 --> 18:36.310
The man asked you
a simple question.

18:36.310 --> 18:37.689
- Don't tell me how to act.

18:49.551 --> 18:51.000
- All right that's enough.

18:52.068 --> 18:54.517
Look none of us
knows why we're here,

18:54.517 --> 18:57.448
but we do know we were all
asked here by the same person.

18:57.448 --> 18:59.206
- Stills?
- Yes.

18:59.206 --> 19:02.758
And I'm not leaving here
until he explains all of this.

19:02.758 --> 19:07.758
- He's not coming.
[giggles]

19:08.724 --> 19:10.172
- What are you talking about?

19:11.034 --> 19:13.310
- How do you know that?

19:13.310 --> 19:15.068
- Because I know him.

19:19.862 --> 19:22.068
And he likes to play games.

19:23.310 --> 19:26.206
[lighter flicking]

19:28.482 --> 19:30.034
- Is she for real?

19:30.034 --> 19:31.862
- I don't know, she
seems off to me.

19:34.137 --> 19:37.862
- Seems like he's not the only
one who likes to play games.

19:37.862 --> 19:40.793
[lighter flicking]

19:54.103 --> 19:55.413
- What do you know?

20:00.758 --> 20:01.862
- You already know.

20:04.344 --> 20:05.620
You've met him too.

20:08.965 --> 20:10.034
You all have.

20:13.689 --> 20:14.517
- You're crazy.

20:19.310 --> 20:20.862
Sure did a number on your baby.

20:23.413 --> 20:25.793
- Wait, have you met him?

20:25.793 --> 20:27.206
- No, I haven't met him.

20:27.206 --> 20:28.758
- What is she talking about?

20:28.758 --> 20:31.034
- I don't have the first damn
clue what she's talking about.

20:31.034 --> 20:32.689
- I told yah she's off, she--

20:32.689 --> 20:35.000
- You can pretend
like you don't know,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.310
but you've all met him.

20:38.379 --> 20:40.586
You can't forget that voice.

20:44.103 --> 20:45.379
I must have been,

20:46.448 --> 20:47.931
15 when I met him.

20:50.206 --> 20:51.068
He was so kind.

20:53.275 --> 20:54.275
He understood,

20:56.172 --> 20:58.310
what I had to do to save them.

20:59.862 --> 21:00.827
- To save who?

21:05.827 --> 21:07.551
- My father was a monster.

21:09.413 --> 21:12.724
He couldn't see
that, he was evil.

21:14.344 --> 21:19.137
I had to stop him, to save them.

21:25.241 --> 21:26.068
So I did.

21:32.413 --> 21:33.827
- You burned him.

21:34.896 --> 21:36.103
- I saved them.

21:40.482 --> 21:41.310
- Jesus.

21:43.034 --> 21:44.275
[loud banging]

21:44.275 --> 21:45.517
- What the fuck was that?

21:54.482 --> 21:57.103
[door creaking]

22:31.655 --> 22:35.034
I'm not crazy, y'all
did hear that right?

22:38.413 --> 22:39.241
You a cop?

22:40.448 --> 22:41.275
- Used to be.

22:42.206 --> 22:43.034
- Hold it.

22:44.448 --> 22:45.551
Where's psycho girl?

23:00.758 --> 23:02.827
- [Stills] Jodie is that you?

23:07.068 --> 23:08.000
- Where are you?

23:23.413 --> 23:24.241
- Maybe she left.

23:26.000 --> 23:26.862
- Yeah.

23:28.793 --> 23:31.413
Her lighter's still here.

23:31.413 --> 23:33.758
- I bet it's Stills,
messing with our heads,

23:33.758 --> 23:35.310
she's in on it.

23:35.310 --> 23:36.896
You heard her earlier,
talking about,

23:36.896 --> 23:37.896
he's not coming.

23:39.448 --> 23:40.448
She knows something.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.310
- You know there were
two more rooms upstairs

23:43.310 --> 23:44.620
we didn't even search.

23:44.620 --> 23:47.103
I say we split up
and look for her.

23:47.103 --> 23:48.931
- Don't forget that
room behind you.

23:52.724 --> 23:54.413
- All right, I'll check in here,

23:54.413 --> 23:55.827
you three search upstairs.

24:07.724 --> 24:10.379
[door creaking]

[tapping on leg]

24:48.931 --> 24:51.586
[woman humming]

25:14.034 --> 25:14.896
- What?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.758
- Check out this
room on the right.

25:21.827 --> 25:23.103
- I got it.

25:23.103 --> 25:24.482
- Okay Ariel, have at it.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.068
[giggling]

25:32.241 --> 25:34.551
Okay, you guys check in there,

25:34.551 --> 25:36.896
I'll handle this other room.

25:59.275 --> 26:00.586
- What?

26:00.586 --> 26:01.965
- How do you know him?

26:01.965 --> 26:03.103
- Who, Stills?

26:04.724 --> 26:06.827
I have therapy
sessions with him.

26:06.827 --> 26:11.241
- So do I, and yet I
can't recall his face.

26:12.310 --> 26:13.103
- Me neither.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.310
- So why were you doing
sessions with him?

26:17.275 --> 26:18.827
- It was a part of my sentence.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.068
- Sentence, you were in jail?

26:22.000 --> 26:22.827
- Surprised?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.827
- A little, but mainly
because that's the exact

26:25.827 --> 26:28.448
same reason I was seeing him.

26:28.448 --> 26:30.137
What were you in for?

26:30.137 --> 26:31.344
- Guess.

26:31.344 --> 26:32.172
- Murder.

26:34.620 --> 26:38.827
- No, frickin' way,
how did you know that?

26:40.068 --> 26:41.275
- Guilty as charged.

26:42.689 --> 26:44.896
But I can't imagine you
killing anyone sweet thing.

26:46.586 --> 26:49.068
- Don't let these
looks fool you.

26:51.206 --> 26:52.586
She's obviously not
in this bathroom,

26:52.586 --> 26:54.827
I'm gonna check back downstairs.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.655
[woman screaming]

27:50.172 --> 27:51.000
- Hey.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.827
Where's your girlfriend?

27:53.827 --> 27:56.172
- Don't look at me man.

27:56.172 --> 27:58.517
Left to come back down here.

28:02.827 --> 28:05.931
- None of this makes any sense.

28:05.931 --> 28:07.068
- To continue on
with that theme,

28:07.068 --> 28:09.758
there's a notepad
upstairs you should see.

28:19.655 --> 28:22.310
[door slamming]

28:25.000 --> 28:29.103
- [Stills] Who are
you, can you see me?

28:29.103 --> 28:29.965
- Stills?

28:32.310 --> 28:35.034
[dramatic music]

28:48.103 --> 28:49.965
- What'd he do,
jump out the window?

28:49.965 --> 28:51.379
What the hell was that light?

28:53.241 --> 28:54.931
- They're all in on it.

28:54.931 --> 28:56.379
- In on what?

28:56.379 --> 28:58.827
Forget this man,
I'm out of here.

28:58.827 --> 28:59.724
- No, wait!

29:01.241 --> 29:03.586
[man yells]

29:05.448 --> 29:08.344
[fingers clicking]

29:12.931 --> 29:13.931
Who's there?

29:24.275 --> 29:26.862
- [Stills] Frank, Frank it's me.

29:26.862 --> 29:29.172
- What the fuck is going on?

29:30.241 --> 29:32.655
- [Stills] Focus on my voice.

29:35.034 --> 29:37.827
[dramatic music]

30:06.965 --> 30:08.758
- Dr Stills.

30:08.758 --> 30:12.758
- Frank, welcome back, I was
worried there for a second.

30:13.724 --> 30:14.620
- What's going on?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.103
Why am I handcuffed?

30:18.172 --> 30:19.689
- It's for my protection.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.137
You've missed a few of
your last appointments.

30:24.310 --> 30:28.068
- No, wait I'm not
a patient of yours.

30:32.827 --> 30:34.448
What'd you do with them?

30:36.344 --> 30:38.689
- I didn't do anything.

30:38.689 --> 30:41.620
The question is, what
did you do with them?

30:41.620 --> 30:42.413
- Me, no.

30:44.034 --> 30:44.965
It was you.

30:46.448 --> 30:47.379
I'm onto you.

30:49.344 --> 30:50.827
You're not gonna
get away with it.

30:52.241 --> 30:55.689
- With all due respect,
I'm not the one handcuffed.

30:57.862 --> 31:00.448
[pen clicking]

31:07.103 --> 31:10.000

[woman humming]

31:17.034 --> 31:19.137
[laughs]

31:24.689 --> 31:26.862
- You sure about that doc.

31:34.862 --> 31:39.310
- [Elizabeth] Stills, who
am I talking too, Frank?

31:40.482 --> 31:42.068
- What the hell
is going on here?

31:42.068 --> 31:44.793
- Dr Stills, I thought
we'd never meet.

31:47.137 --> 31:47.965
- Who are you?

31:49.172 --> 31:51.068
Why am I handcuffed?

31:51.068 --> 31:54.000
- My name is Dr Elizabeth Lacey,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
and those are just for protocol.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.931
For your protection,
as well as my own.

31:58.965 --> 32:01.586
- Protection, I'm not dangerous.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.448
I'm a well respected
doctor, I, I demand to know

32:04.448 --> 32:06.000
what's going on.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.310
- [Elizabeth] Do the names
Evan Sanders, Amber Stone,

32:09.310 --> 32:11.724
or Troy Bateman mean
anything to you.

32:12.862 --> 32:15.000
How about Detective Frank Hobbs?

32:16.344 --> 32:18.413
- Where am I?

32:18.413 --> 32:19.482
Answer me.

32:19.482 --> 32:21.517
- What about Jodie Thompson?

32:21.517 --> 32:23.068
Tell me a little bit about her.

32:36.620 --> 32:38.310
Yeah, you remember
that don't you.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.689
She came to you for help,
she was being abused

32:43.689 --> 32:45.000
and she trusted you.

32:46.241 --> 32:47.758
What did you do?

32:50.241 --> 32:51.586
Where is she?

32:51.586 --> 32:53.034
Where is her body Stills?

32:54.586 --> 32:59.103
Stills, tell me
where you buried her.

32:59.103 --> 33:00.241
Stills.

33:01.655 --> 33:03.137
- He's not coming.

33:12.344 --> 33:13.172
- Shit.

33:15.137 --> 33:16.000
Jodie.

33:19.068 --> 33:20.068
We're starting over.

33:23.620 --> 33:25.172
Listen to my voice Jodie.

33:26.655 --> 33:30.827
Five, four, three,

33:31.689 --> 33:34.517
two, one.

33:36.000 --> 33:36.827
Who are you?

36:15.896 --> 36:16.931
- Mr and Mrs Slack?

36:42.827 --> 36:43.655
Kids?

36:44.793 --> 36:46.103
Mr and Mrs Slack?

36:48.482 --> 36:49.827
Well hello guys.

36:56.896 --> 36:58.379
Okay.

36:58.379 --> 37:00.241
Where are your parents?

37:00.241 --> 37:01.551
- They're gone.

37:01.551 --> 37:02.827
- When did they leave?

37:03.862 --> 37:05.103
- Are you gonna hurt us?

37:05.103 --> 37:07.137
- No, why would you ask that?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.896
- 'Cause the last one did.

37:09.896 --> 37:12.965
- I'm sorry, I would
never hurt you guys.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.310
- I kinda doubt it.

37:23.137 --> 37:25.724
- Why don't you come down here.

37:26.862 --> 37:29.241
I have some treats for y'all.

37:35.103 --> 37:35.965
Hmm, kids.

Another gruesome killing

1:13:12.758 --> 1:13:14.068
was discovered late last night.
