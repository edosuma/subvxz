Both: Letting go!

20:03.803 --> 20:04.835
[both sobbing]

20:04.837 --> 20:08.439
- Hey snot faces, get cleaning!

20:08.874 --> 20:11.375
- Guess I better wash up
before heading back.

20:11.377 --> 20:15.012
Grandpa will get mad if the
bodega truck smells like cheese

20:15.014 --> 20:17.882
or whatever this is.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.456
- It's been 10 minutes,
is he not coming back?

20:25.458 --> 20:26.791
Does he never want
to see me again?

20:26.793 --> 20:27.925
[ringtone playing]
Bobby?

20:27.927 --> 20:30.795
- Um, hey,
so the bathroom door is broken

20:30.797 --> 20:31.862
and I can't get out of here.

20:31.864 --> 20:35.533
- Oh, hang on!
I'll get Flip!

20:35.535 --> 20:37.101
- It's a little temperamental.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.037
You just gotta
sweet talk it a bit!

20:40.039 --> 20:41.739
[straining]

20:41.741 --> 20:45.910
Dang it!
One of yous owes me a doorknob!

20:45.912 --> 20:49.447
- Okay, Boo Boo Bear, the
fire department's on their way.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.549
- Oh, I hope
they get here soon.

20:51.551 --> 20:54.051
You know how terrified
I am of confined spaces.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.020
- Don't worry,
I'm not going anywhere.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.489
I'll stay on the phone
with you until they get here.

20:58.491 --> 21:01.459
- Ah, thanks Babe!
So what should we talk about?

21:01.461 --> 21:04.462
- Um, well, I could tell you
about that funny thing

21:04.464 --> 21:07.031
that happened in math?
- Oh, yeah, I totally

21:07.033 --> 21:08.466
want to hear about that!

21:08.468 --> 21:10.801
- Oh, and last week
for dinner, my dad tried

21:10.803 --> 21:12.470
this new thing with cod.
- Cool!

21:12.472 --> 21:15.106
Like fish sticks
or more of a fillet situation?

21:15.108 --> 21:20.578
Okay, so would you rather give
up all cheeses or all desserts?

21:20.580 --> 21:22.747
- OMG, hmm, tough one...

21:22.749 --> 21:25.116
- I know right?
Because what about--

21:25.118 --> 21:26.484
Both: Cheesecake!

21:26.486 --> 21:29.620
[both laugh]
[both sigh]

21:29.622 --> 21:31.989
- This is so nice.
- And so easy.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.659
- What did
we think was so hard again?

21:34.661 --> 21:36.460
- I have no idea!
I guess I let that

21:36.462 --> 21:38.696
one awkward phone call
get me all freaked out.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.598
- Same!
Maybe we've been trying

21:40.600 --> 21:42.566
to fix something
that isn't broken.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.236
I mean, we know
we love each other, right?

21:45.238 --> 21:46.804
- Of course!
You're the best thing

21:46.806 --> 21:50.041
that ever happened to me.
- Oh, Boo Boo Bear--

21:50.043 --> 21:52.109
[fire truck sirens wail]

21:52.111 --> 21:54.545
- Great idea asking
for a ride, Babe!

21:54.547 --> 21:59.050
- I know!
Isn't it literally so romantic?

21:59.052 --> 22:00.951
- Yeah.
Hey, maybe we could try

22:00.953 --> 22:02.820
to finish that movie
when we get back?

22:02.822 --> 22:04.055
Even though I know Nina dies--

22:04.057 --> 22:08.592
- Aw, come on, man!
