00:06.925 --> 00:10.011
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:16.828 --> 01:19.956
REBECCA: <i>My name is Rebecca Halliday.</i>
<i>I'm a litigator at Lowell Tiller.</i>

01:20.039 --> 01:24.169
<i>This is my deputy, Ross Kessler,</i>
<i>along with Ken Weinraub and Mark Gage.</i>

01:24.252 --> 01:27.213
Our firm has been hired by your employer,
Atlantis World Media,

01:27.297 --> 01:30.467
to represent them in a multimillion dollar
wrongful termination suit.

01:30.550 --> 01:33.928
This is not a formal proceeding.
You are not under oath.

01:34.012 --> 01:36.347
Your statements, however, will be recorded

01:36.431 --> 01:39.267
and a full report,
along with part or all of your statements,

01:39.350 --> 01:42.103
may be turned over to
the plaintiff as discovery.

01:42.187 --> 01:44.189
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.191
REBECCA: This is gonna be simple.

01:46.274 --> 01:49.319
Your testimony revolves around two words.

01:49.402 --> 01:51.029
- It happened.
- It happened.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.781
- The general didn't say that.
- Okay.

01:52.864 --> 01:54.783
And even if he had,
he never said it on the tape.

01:54.866 --> 01:56.785
Whoa, there, little onion.

01:57.368 --> 01:58.620
Okay.

01:58.703 --> 02:00.246
Let me start with a really tough question

02:00.330 --> 02:02.749
and I want you
to take your time and think about it.

02:02.832 --> 02:04.459
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.294
- What's your name?
- I'm sorry?

02:06.377 --> 02:09.464
These guys need your full name, address,
and occupation for the records.

02:09.547 --> 02:10.632
Margaret Claire Jordan.

02:10.715 --> 02:13.301
344 East 75th Street, New York, New York.

02:13.384 --> 02:16.471
I'm an associate producer
with ACN, Atlantis Cable News.

02:16.554 --> 02:19.182
- Do you like the East Side?
- Yeah.

02:19.265 --> 02:21.142
I don't know.
I always thought the best thing about it

02:21.226 --> 02:22.644
was you got to look at the West Side.

02:22.727 --> 02:26.439
I'm on the third floor.
My window faces another window.

02:26.523 --> 02:30.735
I just got shown a place on 5th Avenue.
High floor, wraparound terrace.

02:30.819 --> 02:32.195
It was listed at 17 million,

02:32.278 --> 02:34.239
but the broker thinks it's gonna go
as low as 14.5.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.365
They're very motivated.

02:35.448 --> 02:37.700
I looked at the same place,
but I need a bigger ballroom.

02:37.784 --> 02:40.078
On March 22 of this year,

02:40.161 --> 02:41.996
you and Jerry Dantana
conducted an interview

02:42.080 --> 02:43.498
with General Stanislaus Stomtonovich.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.667
- Am I pronouncing the name correctly?
- Yes.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.294
- Those Dutch don't make it easy, do they?
- It's Polish.

02:48.378 --> 02:49.838
I know, but I just have
a thing about the Dutch.

02:49.921 --> 02:52.048
The interview was conducted at his home

02:52.131 --> 02:54.259
- in Silver Spring, Maryland?
- Yes.

02:54.342 --> 02:57.512
Every four years, we give
these guys a gold medal in "flukentot"

02:57.595 --> 02:59.639
when they grew up having
to "flukentot" to school.

02:59.722 --> 03:01.140
- Who?
- The Dutch.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.476
- I'm Dutch.
- Well, then fuck you.

03:04.853 --> 03:07.647
Look, it's not like I don't know
what this is gonna be about

03:07.730 --> 03:10.108
and I also understand the strategy

03:10.191 --> 03:11.860
of trying to rattle someone
before an interview.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.486
That's not what I'm doing.

03:13.570 --> 03:15.154
I'm trying to see if you laugh anymore.

03:17.365 --> 03:20.118
I make these guys laugh all the time. Don't I?

03:21.035 --> 03:23.580
I crack these guys up.

03:23.663 --> 03:26.541
I am known as a funny lawyer.
You should check me out.

03:26.624 --> 03:28.042
I have checked you out, Rebecca,

03:28.126 --> 03:29.878
and you don't handle
wrongful termination suits.

03:29.961 --> 03:31.713
- You're a First Amendment lawyer.
- I am.

03:31.796 --> 03:33.840
And I haven't read the other ones yet,
but they're on the list.

03:33.923 --> 03:38.678
Well, I'd like to once and for all
abudiate the notion that I am messed up.

03:38.761 --> 03:40.889
- Once and for all.
- I understand.

03:40.972 --> 03:42.932
- Thank you.
- But I'm gonna challenge you on "abudiate."

03:43.016 --> 03:45.226
- Yeah, there's no such word.
- Then why'd you use it?

03:45.310 --> 03:46.644
Because I am funny, too.

03:47.979 --> 03:52.108
We are going to expel or dismiss or expunge

03:52.191 --> 03:54.152
the notion that I am damaged.

03:54.235 --> 03:57.071
I'm hardly the only person in my newsroom
who's ever seen a dead guy.

03:57.155 --> 03:59.449
And that part of this case
would be hanging on my...

03:59.532 --> 04:01.534
- I don't know what to call it.
- State of mind.

04:01.618 --> 04:05.580
Seriously, that part of this case
would be hanging on my state of mind

04:05.663 --> 04:08.416
six months later, by the way,
when we interviewed Stomtonovich...

04:08.499 --> 04:10.543
- Dutch son of a bitch.
- ...is insane.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.337
- I'm not kidding.
- I know.

04:12.462 --> 04:14.005
I'm here to help you abudiate.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.924
- That's what we're doing this morning.
- Okay.

04:16.007 --> 04:18.092
So you're gonna have to tell me about Africa.

04:18.176 --> 04:20.094
The fact that you're even asking
implies that it's relevant.

04:20.178 --> 04:23.431
The fact that it's in Jerry Dantana's affidavit
implies it is relevant.

04:23.514 --> 04:27.060
He says that you were on prescription
medications when you came back from Africa,

04:27.143 --> 04:29.103
probably a series of SSRIs,

04:29.187 --> 04:31.105
- serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
- I wasn't.

04:31.189 --> 04:33.107
And that you're in no position

04:33.191 --> 04:35.944
- to say whether Stomtonovich said...
- It happened.

04:36.027 --> 04:37.695
- ...it happened.
- He didn't say it.

04:37.779 --> 04:40.615
What I would do if I were them
is I would put you in front of a jury

04:40.698 --> 04:42.241
and I would make you tell the Africa story

04:42.325 --> 04:45.119
and I would be good and sure
that you broke down while you were telling it.

04:45.203 --> 04:46.788
They're free to try.

04:46.871 --> 04:49.207
Well, I'd like to get
a first look at how it's gonna go.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.126
Gary Cooper and I flew to Uganda.

04:52.210 --> 04:54.629
Is his name really Gary Cooper?

04:54.712 --> 04:56.005
Yes.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.256
(REBECCA LAUGHS)

04:58.549 --> 05:02.053
I laugh every time I read that.
I can't wait to meet him.

05:02.887 --> 05:04.347
Why did you fly to Uganda?

05:04.430 --> 05:07.141
I pitched a story about
the 100 US combat troops

05:07.225 --> 05:08.893
that were sent to hunt for Joseph Kony,

05:08.977 --> 05:10.728
who's the leader of
the Lord's Resistance Army.

05:10.812 --> 05:12.522
In exchange for access to Camp Kasenyi,

05:12.605 --> 05:14.857
which is our forward
operating base out of Kampala,

05:14.941 --> 05:17.819
the Pentagon's Public Affairs people
wanted us to shoot some film

05:17.902 --> 05:19.946
of soldiers building
an addition onto an orphanage.

05:20.029 --> 05:22.281
That's a sad project when you think about it.

05:22.448 --> 05:24.367
Yeah, I could fall apart any second.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.494
I wasn't baiting you.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.997
When did you and Gary leave?

05:29.080 --> 05:31.374
A year ago September.
The night of September 30.

05:31.457 --> 05:33.459
How do you get to Uganda?

05:33.543 --> 05:34.836
Practice.

05:34.919 --> 05:38.214
You fly to Dubai
and get a connecting flight to Entebbe.

05:38.297 --> 05:41.050
We left straight
from the newsroom right before...

05:41.175 --> 05:42.176
(STIFLES LAUGH)

05:43.094 --> 05:45.471
Right before... God,

05:45.555 --> 05:47.849
right before Will

05:47.932 --> 05:51.352
just murderlized this woman from OWS.

05:51.436 --> 05:53.354
Gary and I watched it in the cab.

05:53.438 --> 05:55.523
<i>The new Fox News poll</i>
<i>has the former Massachusetts governor</i>

05:55.606 --> 05:58.568
<i>back in the lead with 23% of Republicans,</i>

05:58.651 --> 06:03.031
<i>followed by Rick Perry with 19%</i>
<i>and 17% for Herman Cain,</i>

06:03.114 --> 06:07.035
<i>reflecting a big boost</i>
<i>for the former Godfather's Pizza CEO.</i>

06:07.118 --> 06:10.288
<i>On the other side of the break,</i>
<i>I'll have one of the early organizers</i>

06:10.371 --> 06:11.914
<i>of the Occupy Wall Street movement.</i>

06:11.998 --> 06:13.708
<i>- We'll be right back.</i>
- Three minutes back.

06:13.791 --> 06:16.294
- We're leaving.
- Souvenirs, let's go. Shout them out.

06:16.377 --> 06:20.214
I would like any traditional tribal weapon,
short spears, hooks, sticks, bows.

06:20.298 --> 06:22.425
They're not gonna let them
pass security with short spears.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.510
And I'll have an intern get you local sticks.

06:24.594 --> 06:26.137
- Who's next?
- A silk kanzu.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.514
- That's a colorful wrap dress.
- Yeah.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.058
Got about two and a half minutes.

06:30.141 --> 06:32.351
I got a lot of friends
who think this is a bad idea.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.936
- How many?
- I don't know, a lot.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.354
It's just that it's a unit of measurement

06:35.438 --> 06:37.273
I hear invoked more and more.
"A lot of my friends."

06:37.356 --> 06:40.276
Mainstream media's been making us
look like idiots since this thing started.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.028
Don't refer to the mainstream media out there.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.405
It always sounds
like a losing team complaining about the ref.

06:44.489 --> 06:46.074
'Cause that's what
you always make it sound like.

06:48.326 --> 06:50.328
Excuse me. One second.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.082
MAN OVER PA: <i>Two minutes.</i>

06:54.832 --> 06:58.086
We've spidered every social networking site
and public board looking for Hamni8.

06:58.169 --> 07:01.172
We've sent an e-mail
to Hamni8 at every public domain,

07:01.255 --> 07:03.341
including the ISPs
most likely to service that region.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.760
We've got some bounce backs,
but no responses.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.386
We're out of here.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.263
What's going on?

07:09.347 --> 07:12.934
Late Wednesday night, they found a tweet
from a user in the area, Hamni8.

07:13.017 --> 07:14.811
A fast series of tweets
where he describes Genoa.

07:14.894 --> 07:17.063
- We think he's describing Genoa.
- JERRY: He is describing it.

07:17.146 --> 07:18.356
- Jesus.
- He's dead.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.733
- NEAL: We don't know that.
- What's the other option?

07:20.817 --> 07:23.486
- That he can't afford his cell plan anymore.
- Come on...

07:23.569 --> 07:26.114
In most of the developing world,
phones and plans are extremely expensive

07:26.197 --> 07:29.200
relative to income, and almost all are prepaid.
This was two years ago.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.661
He's standing there
describing gas being dropped on a village.

07:31.828 --> 07:34.247
Then the tweets stop and you think
it's because his cell plan ran out?

07:34.330 --> 07:36.624
Maybe they stopped then
because we were jamming their frequency.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.584
- I'm saying it's years later now...
- Fuck!

07:40.044 --> 07:42.380
- It's just gone.
- I need to get Shelly.

07:44.257 --> 07:45.800
It's time.

07:45.883 --> 07:47.468
What do we do now?

07:47.552 --> 07:50.012
Something's got to fall into our lap.

07:50.096 --> 07:53.141
Something's got to fall out of the sky
and right into our lap.

07:53.224 --> 07:55.476
A preposterous stroke of luck has to occur.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.894
Neal, I meant to tell you.

07:56.978 --> 07:59.313
A guy down at OWS
was telling a campfire story

07:59.397 --> 08:02.108
about working for an NGO
and getting the NGO shut down

08:02.191 --> 08:04.152
by the Pakistani government
because he wrote a report

08:04.235 --> 08:06.821
saying US troops
used chemical weapons on civilians.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.072
You should talk to him.

08:08.156 --> 08:09.615
You can just follow me, okay?

08:11.284 --> 08:13.578
- Wait, what?
- Did that just...

08:14.453 --> 08:16.747
Shelly, wait! Stop!

08:16.831 --> 08:20.168
- What did you say?
- The Pakistanis shut down the NGO.

08:20.251 --> 08:22.336
- She needs to be in the studio.
- No. What was the reason?

08:22.420 --> 08:25.590
He wrote a report that said US troops
were using chemical weapons.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.008
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

08:27.091 --> 08:28.509
Does he tend to hang out in the same place

08:28.593 --> 08:30.678
- in Zucotti Park every night?
- We are not hanging out.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.096
- Neal.
- I understand.

08:32.180 --> 08:33.306
Yes, he's in the same place every night.

08:33.389 --> 08:36.058
- Yes, I can take you there.
- Take her to the studio.

08:36.142 --> 08:37.810
This way.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.481
Okay. Okay.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.984
Thirty seconds back.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.195
And here comes dinner.

08:47.278 --> 08:49.322
- How you doing?
- Good, thank you.

08:49.405 --> 08:51.699
- Yeah, I got it.
- I'm sorry?

08:51.782 --> 08:53.534
I was talking to my producer.

08:53.618 --> 08:55.203
- How do I look?
- Good.

08:55.286 --> 08:57.246
No, producer again.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.123
Is he just screwing with her?

08:59.207 --> 09:02.627
- Come on.
- In three, two...

09:02.710 --> 09:05.546
<i>It's been two weeks</i>
<i>since a group of protesters</i>

09:05.630 --> 09:08.591
<i>began camping out</i>
<i>in Zucotti Park here in New York City.</i>

09:08.674 --> 09:11.510
<i>The Occupy Wall Street movement</i>
<i>has turned to social media</i>

09:11.594 --> 09:14.597
<i>and held marches</i>
<i>through the streets of the financial district.</i>

09:14.680 --> 09:16.974
<i>Here in the studio today is one of the leaders</i>

09:17.058 --> 09:19.143
<i>of Occupy Wall Street, Shelly Wexler.</i>

09:19.227 --> 09:20.770
- Don't take the bait.
<i>- Shelly, thanks for being with us.</i>

09:20.853 --> 09:23.397
<i>It's good to be here,</i>
<i>but I am not one of the leaders of OWS.</i>

09:23.481 --> 09:25.608
<i>- We don't have leaders.</i>
<i>- Is that a good idea?</i>

09:25.691 --> 09:28.194
- Not having leaders?
- Yeah.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.571
Yes, because this way,
everyone's sure to have a voice.

09:30.655 --> 09:32.573
Sounds like a lot of people talking at once.

09:32.657 --> 09:35.451
But tell us in a few words
what OWS is protesting.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.703
We are protesting a variety of issues,

09:37.787 --> 09:39.455
the co-opting of the government by the rich,

09:39.538 --> 09:43.626
the lack of any prosecution for the crimes
that led to the collapse of 2008,

09:43.709 --> 09:45.753
Citizens United, social inequality.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.129
So not any particular thing?

09:48.673 --> 09:50.299
Not one particular thing.

09:50.383 --> 09:51.926
You're protesting against lots of things?

09:52.009 --> 09:55.972
<i>The list of things we're protesting against</i>
<i>is as varied as the protesters themselves.</i>

09:56.055 --> 09:59.517
<i>I've seen protesters holding signs that say,</i>
<i>"We are the 99%."</i>

10:01.477 --> 10:04.063
Some people would say
I'm overpaid, but I'm not.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.148
I'm paid exactly what the market will bear,

10:06.232 --> 10:07.650
which means I'm paid what I'm worth.

10:07.733 --> 10:10.486
So which system would you
replace capitalism with?

10:12.488 --> 10:15.700
We wouldn't...
I wouldn't replace it with any system.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.368
I would make the system fairer.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.953
- By passing new laws?
- Yes.

10:19.036 --> 10:22.123
- It's Congress who does that.
- Yes.

10:22.206 --> 10:25.459
It's legislation like Dodd-Frank
that the banks really fear, right?

10:25.543 --> 10:26.585
Yes.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.129
If your congressman or your senator

10:28.212 --> 10:30.589
or the Chairman of the House
Financial Services Committee

10:30.673 --> 10:33.134
or the Speaker of the House
wanted to hear the demands

10:33.217 --> 10:35.803
of OWS, who would they meet with?

10:35.886 --> 10:37.805
We're not looking for a meeting.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.515
They wouldn't be able to
meet with anyone, right?

10:39.598 --> 10:40.599

10:40.683 --> 10:43.644
I'm trying to find the virtue
of a leaderless movement

10:43.728 --> 10:45.313
where everyone's voices are heard.

10:45.396 --> 10:46.856
<i>That isn't the point.</i>

10:46.939 --> 10:48.983
We want everyone to look
at Occupy Wall Street

10:49.066 --> 10:51.652
and ask themselves the question,
"Why is this happening?"

10:51.736 --> 10:53.487
I think that's been taken care of.

10:53.571 --> 10:56.407
But what happens after
people ask themselves that?

10:56.490 --> 10:57.992
<i>- Change, we hope.</i>
<i>- How?</i>

10:58.075 --> 11:00.036
<i>The same way change has always happened.</i>

11:00.119 --> 11:03.372
<i>What is your best-case scenario</i>
<i>for how this ends?</i>

11:04.206 --> 11:06.834
- That it doesn't end.
- Oh, God.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.544
<i>- That it doesn't end?</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

11:17.970 --> 11:21.140
Like most of the media,
I don't think you're taking this seriously.

11:21.223 --> 11:24.226
Is there any chance
that's because you're not?

11:25.853 --> 11:27.855
- Hey, it didn't go that badly.
- Fuck off!

11:27.938 --> 11:30.441
- Come on.
- I am humiliated and in shock.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.611
This whole thing is messed up
and he's a fucking asshole, by the way.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.779
He's not.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.156
Trying to be funny
at the expense of the guest.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.532
I don't think it was as bad as you think it was.

11:38.616 --> 11:39.867
Which way do I go to get out of here?

11:39.950 --> 11:41.619
- No. You need to take me to the guy.
- What?

11:41.702 --> 11:44.497
- The guy in the park.
- You think I'm disposed to doing you a favor?

11:44.580 --> 11:46.540
No, Shelly. Shelly, we need to meet this guy.

11:46.624 --> 11:48.250
- We need to read the report he wrote.
- No.

11:48.334 --> 11:49.460
- Shelly.
- Forget it.

11:49.543 --> 11:50.795
No, I can't tell you what this is about,

11:50.878 --> 11:52.630
but it's way too important
to use as a payback...

11:52.713 --> 11:54.882
I could have gone anywhere.
I did this as a favor to you.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.759
I need you to take me to this guy.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.219

12:56.360 --> 12:58.446
Good evening.
We're with the Romney Press Corps.

12:58.529 --> 13:02.575
Three rooms under James Harper,
Hallie Shea and...

13:02.658 --> 13:04.910
You know what? I don't know your first name.

13:04.994 --> 13:06.579
- I'm sorry.
- Stillman's my first name.

13:06.704 --> 13:08.414
- Stillman's your first name?
- Yeah.

13:08.497 --> 13:09.874
- What's your last name?
- Frank.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.125
You sure it's not the other way around?

13:11.208 --> 13:13.002
It's three rooms. Harper, Frank, and Shea.

13:13.085 --> 13:15.129
I'm sorry, I'm not seeing anything.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.630
You said you were with the Romney bus?

13:16.714 --> 13:17.965
Yeah.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.050
The Romney Press Corps is all checked in.

13:20.885 --> 13:22.887
I understand what's happened.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.973
- We got off the Romney bus.
- 'Cause you said you were...

13:26.056 --> 13:28.309
Yeah, we're still covering
the campaign, we're just...

13:28.392 --> 13:31.437
It's not... We're staging a protest.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.731
I don't want to bore you with the details.

13:33.814 --> 13:36.734
It has to do with accountability
and access and just...

13:36.817 --> 13:40.029
So we got off the bus,

13:40.112 --> 13:42.531
and now I understand that the campaign

13:42.615 --> 13:44.867
isn't going to be arranging our hotel.
Does that make sense?

13:44.950 --> 13:47.161
- No, you should explain it some more.
- So we'll need three rooms.

13:47.244 --> 13:51.957
I'm sorry. We're very full
with the campaign staff and the press.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.168

13:54.251 --> 13:56.545

don't you think?

Hey, guys. What do you say, Slim Jim?

13:59.590 --> 14:02.218
- Checking in.
- I thought you said the press was checked in.

14:02.301 --> 14:05.054
The press that's on the bus,
the press we're responsible for.

14:05.137 --> 14:07.848
- Not the freedom riders.
- We have a room.

14:07.932 --> 14:10.351
- I have seven rooms.
- Of course.

Six of which I'm willing to rent out
to anyone who says, "Romney rocks."

14:13.437 --> 14:16.273
I'll say "Romney rocks"
if you give me 30 minutes with the candidate.

14:16.357 --> 14:18.651
Why do you keep asking
when you know the answer is going to be no?

14:18.734 --> 14:20.069
So I can say I kept asking.

14:20.152 --> 14:23.072
I hate the press in ways
you can't even comprehend.

14:23.155 --> 14:25.115

- I call the cot.
- Got it.

Around 8:00 a.m. local time.

We were picked up by a fixer named Ronald.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.461
He works for ACN?

15:19.670 --> 15:21.839
We don't have a bureau in Africa.
He's freelance.

15:21.964 --> 15:25.843
He works for National Geographic Channel,

we had to go to the orphanage,

15:36.186 --> 15:37.521

15:37.813 --> 15:40.899
It's a four to nine-hour drive
depending on the condition of the roads.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.443
What condition could the roads possibly be

15:42.526 --> 15:44.486
that the drive time
fluctuates four to nine hours?

15:44.570 --> 15:47.364
Sometimes there's mud.
Sometimes there's a genocide.

he was gonna see drug lords.

- Yeah.

want the apology from me.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.194
(GRUNTS)

21:26.203 --> 21:28.246
- I shouldn't have turned around to look.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.539
Everybody all right?

21:29.623 --> 21:31.041
I'm good.

21:33.418 --> 21:34.419
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

21:34.628 --> 21:35.921
That's me.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.297
You paired your phone to the car?

21:37.381 --> 21:38.882
I got here first.

21:49.393 --> 21:52.145
- Hello?
- MAN: <i>Hallie, what the hell is going on?</i>

21:52.229 --> 21:54.189
<i>Why is everybody but us</i>
<i>writing about the job speech</i>

21:54.272 --> 21:55.732
<i>Romney's gonna give in Las Vegas?</i>

21:55.816 --> 21:57.693
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Evan.

21:57.776 --> 21:59.861
The rest of the press corps
got an advance copy.

21:59.945 --> 22:02.030
<i>- Why didn't you?</i>
- I wasn't on the bus.

22:02.114 --> 22:03.740
<i>You said this stunt wasn't</i>
<i>gonna fuck anything up.</i>

22:03.824 --> 22:05.492
- It won't.
<i>- It just did.</i>

22:05.575 --> 22:08.120
I'm at all the campaign stops
and I'll be in Vegas for the speech.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.956
<i>But everybody else got an advance copy</i>
<i>and they're writing about it.</i>

22:11.039 --> 22:12.499
<i>We look like we're doing this from home.</i>

22:12.582 --> 22:13.792
We've got something they don't.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.752
<i>- What?</i>
- Guts.

22:16.253 --> 22:18.547
<i>I couldn't be less</i>
<i>in the mood for you to be a wiseass, Hallie.</i>

22:18.630 --> 22:20.882
<i>I'm giving you $500 a week plus expenses.</i>

22:20.966 --> 22:23.510
To be fair, you're not giving it to me.
You're paying it to me.

22:23.593 --> 22:26.179
<i>No, if I don't get something back,</i>
<i>I'm giving it to you.</i>

22:26.263 --> 22:28.724
<i>So unless you want to put on heels</i>
<i>and fuck me for an hour,</i>

22:28.807 --> 22:31.351
<i>you need to stop being a little bitch.</i>

22:33.270 --> 22:35.313
- Yeah.
<i>- Tell me if you can't do this</i>

22:35.397 --> 22:37.691
<i>- so I can find someone who can.</i>
- No.

22:39.109 --> 22:41.028
No, I can do this.

22:44.281 --> 22:45.866
You left <i>The Denver Post</i> for that?

22:45.949 --> 22:47.909
Feel free to be superior.

22:47.993 --> 22:50.370
He doesn't set the bar very high.

22:53.290 --> 22:55.792
The world's first fat tax
was announced in Denmark.

22:55.876 --> 22:57.169
- That's mean.
- How?

22:57.252 --> 22:58.670
Taxing people who are overweight?

22:58.754 --> 23:02.799
No, imbecile. It's not a tax on people.
It's a tax on saturated fat.

23:02.883 --> 23:04.801
But you're right, that would have been mean.

23:04.885 --> 23:06.553
NINA: About an hour ago on <i>Fox & Friends,</i>

23:06.636 --> 23:09.181
Hank Williams Jr. compared
Boehner and Obama playing golf

23:09.264 --> 23:11.224
to Hitler and Netanyahu playing golf.

23:11.308 --> 23:13.226
Tell me something and tell it to me straight.

23:13.310 --> 23:15.103
Who is Hank Williams Jr.?

23:15.187 --> 23:17.355
He was a country music star
until about an hour ago.

23:17.439 --> 23:20.734
"Pentagon has decided
military chaplains may now perform oral sex."

23:20.817 --> 23:21.985
What?

23:22.944 --> 23:24.321
Give me my real rundown.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.739
(ALL CHUCKLING)

23:25.822 --> 23:27.157
Idiots.

23:27.866 --> 23:32.079
"The Pentagon has decided military chaplains
may now perform same-sex marriages."

23:32.162 --> 23:35.165
And, Kendra, I apologize,
but the <i>Washington Post</i>

23:35.248 --> 23:39.461
reported last night that Rick Perry
leases a hunting ranch called Niggerhead.

23:39.544 --> 23:42.130
I accept your apology on behalf
of all the black people in the room.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.591
- I get that that was a thinly veiled...
- It wasn't veiled.

23:44.674 --> 23:47.969
Okay. "Obama defends loan to Solyndra,
calling it a good..."

23:48.053 --> 23:49.930
(SCREAMS) Stop doing that!

23:50.555 --> 23:52.140
Good morning.

23:56.186 --> 23:58.313
What happened with the tweet from Hamni8?

23:58.396 --> 24:01.108
They can't find Hamni8.
But something else happened.

24:01.191 --> 24:03.652
The woman from OWS
who was on Friday night...

24:03.735 --> 24:05.487
- Has murdered Will?
- She's not happy.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.906
And that's relevant
because she says that a guy

24:07.989 --> 24:10.408
who hangs out in her area at Zucotti Park

24:10.492 --> 24:13.203
has mentioned a report he wrote
for an NGO in Pakistan

24:13.286 --> 24:15.372
about us using chemical weapons.

24:15.455 --> 24:18.500
She was gonna lead
Neal and Jerry there after the show, but then...

24:18.583 --> 24:20.127
- She met Will.
- Yeah.

24:20.210 --> 24:23.004
- Well, fix that.
- How?

24:23.088 --> 24:24.840
You put a help wanted ad in the paper

24:24.923 --> 24:28.093
- for someone who can do your job.
- Good. Anything else?

24:28.176 --> 24:31.263
- I just want to know that it didn't happen.
- That's not easy to do.

24:31.346 --> 24:34.808
You should include in the ad that applicants
need to be able to do hard things.

24:34.933 --> 24:35.976
Got it.

24:36.059 --> 24:37.686
When's Jim coming back
from New Hampshire?

24:37.769 --> 24:40.647
- Soon.
- He gets paid way too much for an embed.

24:40.730 --> 24:43.441
Do you know what we pay embeds?
Some weeks it's in coupons.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.527
I'll see you later.

24:49.197 --> 24:51.700
Kendra, run the meeting.
I'll be back in a minute.

24:51.783 --> 24:53.201
Okay.

24:53.285 --> 24:54.828
Good morning.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.330
- Hi.
- So, great news.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.374
Let me tell you something about liberals.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.251
He didn't paint the word on the rock.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.336
His father didn't paint the word on the rock.

25:03.420 --> 25:06.464
And the word was painted
over after his family leased the ranch.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.466
You're absolutely right
and that's a good point.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.344
But I wanted to talk to you about...
What does that have to do with liberals?

25:11.428 --> 25:13.638
You all should be
asking yourselves if you're condemning him

25:13.722 --> 25:15.557
because he's from the South
and this is a good way

25:15.640 --> 25:17.934
to distance yourselves
from our shared heritage.

25:19.686 --> 25:23.064
Let's talk for a second
about unintended consequences.

25:23.148 --> 25:25.567
- Sure.
- The woman we had on Friday night,

25:25.650 --> 25:28.153
- from OWS, Shelly Wexler...
- Yeah.

25:28.236 --> 25:29.988
Would you be willing to apologize to her?

25:30.071 --> 25:31.072
- Sure.
- On air?

25:31.156 --> 25:32.699
- Absolutely.
- So no?

25:32.782 --> 25:34.201
What were the consequences?

25:34.284 --> 25:36.286
Jerry's been chasing a story for a few weeks

25:36.411 --> 25:38.121
- and I'm not gonna tell you what it is.
- Why?

25:38.205 --> 25:40.874
If I tell you the reason,
you'll be more curious about the story.

25:40.957 --> 25:43.126
But now I'm more curious about the reason.

25:44.461 --> 25:47.214
There's some evidence to suggest

25:47.297 --> 25:49.883
that the Army
is thinking about having different uniforms

25:49.966 --> 25:51.468
for home and away games.

25:52.469 --> 25:54.179
I don't believe that's really the story.

25:54.262 --> 25:56.640
At some point, I might
need you for the red team.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.683
You could have just said that.
I understand that.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.143
- I'm not a child.
- Okay.

26:00.227 --> 26:01.645
- You have to tell me what the story is.
- No!

26:01.728 --> 26:04.481
At least tell me
how it relates to the woman from OWS.

26:04.564 --> 26:06.942
She can lead us to someone
who might be able to help,

26:07.025 --> 26:09.486
but she won't unless you apologize.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.321
Her movement is idiotic
and she's unprepared.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.907
So as a courtesy, I was dismissive.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.408
What does she want an apology for?

26:15.492 --> 26:18.745
- Being smug.
- That... Really?

26:18.828 --> 26:21.498
I know. I've never heard anybody
say that about you before

26:21.581 --> 26:23.667
and I certainly can't identify personally.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.502
You're just chock-full
of beans today, aren't you?

26:25.585 --> 26:27.504
So that's a hard no on apologizing?

26:30.423 --> 26:32.425
I was asked to ask.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.722
Come in.

26:37.806 --> 26:40.892
- Hey, how was your weekend?
- It was good.

26:40.976 --> 26:43.478
It was good and then I saw
<i>Titanic</i> for the first time.

26:43.561 --> 26:44.980
You'd never seen it before?

26:45.063 --> 26:46.481
You know how I am about sad movies

26:46.564 --> 26:48.525
and the title suggested
it wasn't gonna end well.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.568
But I still didn't see it coming.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.154
Mac, what is more important
than the people you...

26:53.238 --> 26:55.407
Kodak is dropping like a sack of flour.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.575
I'll never let go, Kodak. I'll never let go.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.287
But people should really sell their Kodak
stock because by this afternoon...

27:00.370 --> 27:02.831
- I need you.
- That's all you ever have to say.

27:02.914 --> 27:04.457
- Get it together.
- Yeah, all right.

27:04.541 --> 27:06.459
The woman we had on from OWS Friday night

27:06.543 --> 27:08.586
- thought she was mistreated.
- She was.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.630
And it's possible
that she can lead us to information

27:10.714 --> 27:12.757
that can help with a story
I can't tell you about yet.

27:12.841 --> 27:14.634
But to do that, we have to make her happy.

27:14.718 --> 27:16.803
- How can I help?
- Neal's gonna set up a meeting.

27:16.886 --> 27:19.848
And you're gonna...
You're just gonna make her feel

27:19.931 --> 27:22.350
like she's being heard by a financial expert.

27:22.434 --> 27:25.312
You're Sloan Sabbith
and you went to meet her.

27:25.395 --> 27:27.355
- Just lather it on.
- Got it.

27:27.439 --> 27:29.482
Whatever she says,
you couldn't agree with more.

27:29.566 --> 27:31.568
I'm gonna lather up
just to honor the memory of Jack Dawson.

27:31.651 --> 27:32.819
- From the boat?
- Yeah.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.946
Okay, but it's not "lather up," it's...

27:35.030 --> 27:37.240
Don't worry about it. Talk to Neal.

27:40.744 --> 27:42.245
SHELLY: Will McAvoy is an asshole.

27:42.329 --> 27:45.790
SLOAN: I know how you feel.
But the thing is, he's not.

27:45.874 --> 27:47.959
You had a rough time. That's okay.

27:48.043 --> 27:50.337
You've got information that you don't realize

27:50.420 --> 27:52.839
could help Neal and his team
with a story I'm certain,

27:52.922 --> 27:55.508
certain you'd want told.

27:56.968 --> 27:59.387
- What's the story?
- I shouldn't have said that,

27:59.471 --> 28:01.348
because I don't have
the first idea what the story is.

28:01.431 --> 28:02.932
What the fuck is with you people?

28:03.016 --> 28:04.642
She doesn't know what the story is by design.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.728
On a big story,
you want to bring in some people at the end

28:06.811 --> 28:09.814
and run everything by fresh eyes
and let them try to punch holes in it.

28:09.898 --> 28:11.399
They're called the red team.

28:11.483 --> 28:13.026
When's your story supposed to air?

28:13.109 --> 28:16.196
This? Probably never.

28:16.279 --> 28:18.782
You know, I teach three classes on Mondays.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.909
I came up here.
I'm supposed to be impressed?

28:20.992 --> 28:23.078
- No one's trying to impress you.
- Yes, you are.

28:23.161 --> 28:24.329
Because here's what happened.

28:24.412 --> 28:25.872
This woman's here at Shake Shack

28:25.955 --> 28:29.125
because someone asked Will to apologize
and Will said no.

28:29.209 --> 28:32.712
Do you see how
things are worse than they were before?

28:32.796 --> 28:36.800
'Cause before you could assume
that no one ever asked Will,

28:36.883 --> 28:40.804
and now it's pretty clear
that because of the story, he was asked.

28:40.887 --> 28:43.223
- You guys didn't think this through.
- No.

28:43.306 --> 28:44.891
This is exactly why we need a red team.

28:44.974 --> 28:48.395
Shelly, can we just say
that we're honestly very sorry

28:48.478 --> 28:49.771
that appearing on ACN
was an unpleasant experience?

28:49.854 --> 28:50.980
Please, no.

28:51.064 --> 28:53.149
Your apology,
which was meaningless in the first place,

28:53.233 --> 28:55.110
is now just a symbol
of the other guy's refusal to apologize.

28:55.193 --> 28:56.403
This is getting a little nutty.

28:56.486 --> 28:58.405
Shelly, can you just tell Neal
what he needs to know?

28:58.488 --> 29:00.323
And I am supposed to be impressed

29:00.407 --> 29:02.534
'cause here comes your
money honey all solicitous.

29:02.617 --> 29:04.327
- Hey! I can hear you.
- Like I'm a fucking rube

29:04.411 --> 29:06.579
who's never seen a TV star before
or who would even care.

29:06.663 --> 29:08.581
- Listen. Wait.
- I teach college.

29:08.665 --> 29:12.252
Hang on. Let me ask you something
and I'd like an honest answer.

29:12.335 --> 29:13.545
Sure.

29:14.504 --> 29:16.756
- Do you really think I'm a TV star?
- You know...

29:16.840 --> 29:19.426
You called me a money honey
and I made a self-deprecating joke.

29:19.509 --> 29:22.679
I didn't do it in front of a million and a half
people and this isn't a joke to me.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.931
I've got to leave.
You guys are condescending.

29:25.014 --> 29:26.933
Really?
'Cause I'm pretty sure I wasn't just the one

29:27.016 --> 29:30.103
who distinguished myself
from rubes by saying, "I teach college."

29:31.312 --> 29:32.897
Did Will say no when someone said,

29:32.981 --> 29:35.108
"We need you to apologize to Shelly Wexler.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.193
"We badly need you to apologize"?

29:37.277 --> 29:40.280
I wasn't in the room, but I'm sure he said,

29:40.363 --> 29:43.324
"Hell, no, and who the fuck is Shelly Wexler?"

29:44.200 --> 29:47.454
Well, now you know
how much of a prick he is.

29:52.375 --> 29:53.543
NEAL: Yeah.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.838
No. Sloan was smug.

29:57.130 --> 29:58.882
(SLURPING LOUDLY)

29:59.424 --> 30:03.761
So there was this kid named Daniel
who was by himself the whole time.

30:10.351 --> 30:11.603
Who's he?

30:12.854 --> 30:13.938
That's Daniel.

30:15.190 --> 30:17.400
His parents are both alive.

30:17.484 --> 30:19.319
I'm a family friend.

30:19.569 --> 30:21.988
His father has a lot of cattle

30:22.071 --> 30:25.783
and there have been
some clashes with Pokot raiders from Kenya.

30:27.035 --> 30:29.913
So Daniel's here to be safe for a few days.

30:30.914 --> 30:32.916
I started talking to him.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.376
Do you want me to read that book to you?

30:36.753 --> 30:38.922
I'm not gonna take it.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.799
You can hold it
and be the page-turner and I'll just read it.

30:46.304 --> 30:48.139
Come on. Scoot over.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.905
"This is the house.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.949
"The house on East 88th Street.

31:06.032 --> 31:10.703
"Mr. and Mrs. Primm and their son Joshua
live in the house on East 88th Street."

31:10.787 --> 31:14.123
I read it to him maybe three times.

31:15.208 --> 31:16.459
Again.

31:17.001 --> 31:18.002
Okay.

31:22.757 --> 31:24.842
- Three times.
- DANIEL: <i>Again.</i>

31:25.260 --> 31:27.637
We've read it seven times now.

31:28.429 --> 31:30.139
Please, just one more.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.726
That's a lot of trust, Daniel.

31:34.811 --> 31:36.688
All right, one more.

31:36.771 --> 31:40.316
"But if Lyle was happy,
he was making someone else unhappy.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.193
"Perfectly miserable, in fact.

31:42.277 --> 31:44.279
"That someone else was Loretta."

31:44.362 --> 31:46.155
"The house on East 88th Street."

31:46.239 --> 31:48.074
"...the voice called out.
Lyle recognized the voice."

31:48.157 --> 31:50.159
"Have you seen a crocodile going past?

31:50.243 --> 31:51.703
"He was wearing a red scarf."

31:51.828 --> 31:54.247
"If Lyle was happy,
he was making someone else unhappy."

31:54.330 --> 31:57.125
"I have no information
about a crocodile wearing a red..."

31:57.417 --> 31:58.751
Scarf.

31:59.127 --> 32:01.629
"There was little they could do,
at least for the moment,

32:01.713 --> 32:05.008
"to prevent Mr. Grumps
from putting Lyle in the zoo."

32:05.091 --> 32:06.759
He's never seen hair like yours.

32:06.843 --> 32:09.804
That color's called blonde, Daniel,

32:09.887 --> 32:12.223
and it's nothing but trouble.

32:13.224 --> 32:14.517
Maggie.

32:16.728 --> 32:17.854
Ronald.

32:19.063 --> 32:20.898
- Yeah?
- Time to go.

32:20.982 --> 32:23.109
No, we can't drive these roads at night.

32:23.192 --> 32:25.653
- It's not night.
- It will be.

32:27.530 --> 32:29.699
When were you gonna tell us
we couldn't drive back?

32:29.782 --> 32:31.451
I just did.

32:34.245 --> 32:37.081
- Lt. Casey.
- Yes, ma'am?

32:37.624 --> 32:40.668
Could we possibly get
a ride back with you guys?

32:40.752 --> 32:42.879
- We're flying out.
- Even better.

32:42.962 --> 32:44.297
We're going to Djibouti.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.633
Is that near where we're going?

32:46.716 --> 32:48.176
No.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.721
You're not a great fixer, you know that?

32:51.804 --> 32:55.391
I don't know how <i>The Amazing Race</i>
is as amazing as it is.

33:00.897 --> 33:01.939
Again.

33:02.523 --> 33:04.067
(DANIEL LAUGHS)

33:18.665 --> 33:20.500
MACKENZIE: <i>I don't really understand</i>
<i>your reasons</i>

33:20.583 --> 33:22.460
<i>for not being on the campaign,</i>
<i>but I'm going to have to insist</i>

33:22.543 --> 33:24.003
<i>that you at least be near the campaign.</i>

33:24.087 --> 33:26.506
I am. Everybody's here.
I'm making all the stops,

33:26.589 --> 33:28.216
or at least the ones I can MapQuest.

33:28.299 --> 33:29.467
<i>You can’t just follow the bus?</i>

33:29.550 --> 33:31.427
They're making really fast buses now.

33:31.969 --> 33:33.471
<i>Do me a favor.</i>

33:33.554 --> 33:35.306
<i>- Romney gave a statement.</i>
- Yeah?

33:35.390 --> 33:37.016
<i>He called the name of the ranch offensive.</i>

33:37.100 --> 33:39.727
<i>He should be asked about the church.</i>
<i>Can you get a comment from someone?</i>

33:39.811 --> 33:41.229
On that? I doubt it.

33:41.312 --> 33:44.941
<i>Try hard.</i>
<i>Charlie doesn't know what you're doing there.</i>

33:45.024 --> 33:46.567
All right.

33:55.326 --> 33:57.203
- Taylor.
- Jim.

33:57.286 --> 33:58.705
- I need to ask...
- How was your day?

33:58.788 --> 34:00.206
Fine, thanks. I need to ask

34:00.289 --> 34:02.375
about the Governor's response
to Rick Perry's ranch.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.168
There was a statement
in this morning's e-mail,

34:04.252 --> 34:06.546
which you don't get,
so you're free to watch TV.

34:06.629 --> 34:08.214
I know he said he thought it was offensive.

34:08.297 --> 34:11.134
He does and that is the official comment of
the Romney campaign.

34:11.217 --> 34:14.971
And now we are going back to business,
which for me is a glass of red wine right now.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.724
He was a leader in his church in 1977, right?

34:17.807 --> 34:19.726
Do you think I'm gonna talk
about the Mormon Church?

34:19.809 --> 34:21.602
By commenting on the Perry ranch
you already have

34:21.686 --> 34:24.856
because it wasn't until 1978 that Mormons
allowed Mormons to be black.

34:24.939 --> 34:27.400
People of faith are also people of free will

34:27.483 --> 34:30.194
and they are able to disagree
with their church on a number of issues.

34:30.278 --> 34:31.904
The governor was one
of the leaders of his church.

34:31.988 --> 34:33.948
- Did he ever object...
- And Joe Biden is Catholic.

34:34.031 --> 34:37.910
Catholics don't allow women to be priests.
Is Joe fighting a war on women?

34:37.994 --> 34:39.912
Is that the official comment
of the Romney campaign?

34:39.996 --> 34:41.247
You know, go fuck yourself, Jim.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.458
That is the official comment
of the Romney campaign.

34:51.174 --> 34:52.258
All right.

34:54.051 --> 34:58.848
All right, just tell me what you need
to forget I said that.

35:09.192 --> 35:14.113
You're gonna have a 30 minute one-on-one
with the Governor tonight at 10:00.

35:20.203 --> 35:21.621
Thanks.

35:31.047 --> 35:33.508
I, too, believe Will
and Sloan can be a little smug

35:33.591 --> 35:35.134
and I think you guys
are showing a lot of wisdom

35:35.218 --> 35:36.969
by having me be the one to fix it.

35:37.053 --> 35:38.763
You were really the only one left.

35:38.846 --> 35:41.224
- The only guy for the job.
- The only one left.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.976
- The only one who can get it done.
- There was nobody else.

35:44.060 --> 35:46.354
- Nobody but me.
- Left in the office.

35:46.437 --> 35:48.356
- One man...
- There she is. Hey, Shell.

35:48.439 --> 35:50.817
I have another class from 8:00 to 10:00
and this is my only break

35:50.900 --> 35:52.485
and I don't want to spend
that much of it with you,

35:52.568 --> 35:54.195
so let's get this over with.

35:54.278 --> 35:55.613
This is Don Keefer.

35:55.696 --> 35:57.657
I'm the executive producer of our 10:00 hour

35:57.740 --> 35:59.992
<i>Right Now with Elliot Hirsch</i>
and I'll give you a segment.

36:00.076 --> 36:01.661
It'll be a much gentler interview.

36:01.744 --> 36:04.789
And if I came on Elliot Hirsch's show,
would I be able to talk about my treatment?

36:04.872 --> 36:07.083
The treatment OWS got
during the first interview?

36:07.166 --> 36:09.544
You'd be able to talk about OWS,

36:09.627 --> 36:12.338
but I can't produce your revenge fantasy,
if that's what you're asking.

36:12.421 --> 36:15.258
- Please stop arranging meetings.
- Just listen to what...

36:15.341 --> 36:18.177
- It's a very important story.
- Do you know what the story is?

36:18.261 --> 36:20.096
- I don't, but I know it's important.
- How?

36:20.179 --> 36:22.348
- Because Neal says it is.
- And when you say it's important,

36:22.431 --> 36:24.183
what you really mean is that
it's more important than OWS.

36:24.267 --> 36:27.270
- We apologize for anything...
- "We" don't apologize.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.938
- Many of us do.
- Bye.

36:29.021 --> 36:32.149
Oh, Shelly, please take Neal
to see the guy in Zucotti Park.

36:32.233 --> 36:34.944
Let this serve as electroshock therapy.

36:35.278 --> 36:37.363
Every time you want
to look down your nose at someone...

36:37.446 --> 36:39.031
Maybe we're not the ones who need therapy.

36:39.115 --> 36:41.367
Maybe your debilitating
persecution complex could be,

36:41.450 --> 36:44.954
if not cured, then put in remission by
a team of Viennese specialists.

36:45.538 --> 36:46.706
Anything else?

36:46.789 --> 36:48.291
- Nope.
- Wait.

36:50.751 --> 36:53.462
I shouldn't have said that last thing.

36:55.798 --> 36:56.799
Psst.

36:59.218 --> 37:01.345
- Me?
- I'm killing it.

37:01.429 --> 37:02.805
You know why?

37:03.639 --> 37:04.974
Vassar.

37:05.308 --> 37:06.434
Ka-boom.

37:07.310 --> 37:08.311
(INCOMING VIDEO CALL TONE)

37:08.394 --> 37:09.478
Sorry.

37:09.896 --> 37:12.940
Can you make it fast?
'Cause I'm a little on fire.

37:13.024 --> 37:15.359
There's no signal in the hallway.

37:16.485 --> 37:18.779
Hey, Mac.
Just one second. They're stepping out.

37:18.863 --> 37:21.949
<i>Taylor just called me.</i>
<i>Did you give away an interview with Romney?</i>

37:24.660 --> 37:27.204
If you could give me just a second?
I don't have the room yet.

37:27.288 --> 37:30.207
<i>You know exactly how fucked up it is</i>
<i>that you gave it away.</i>

37:30.291 --> 37:32.418
<i>And that you gave it to a girl you like.</i>

37:32.501 --> 37:35.171
It's not exactly like that,
but it was definitely wrong

37:35.254 --> 37:36.923
and I apologize and I'll call Will.

37:37.006 --> 37:38.633
<i>- Don't call Will.</i>
- If he finds out another way...

37:38.716 --> 37:41.552
<i>I'll take that chance. I don't know</i>
<i>how to predict his behavior anymore.</i>

37:41.636 --> 37:42.762
<i>Or yours.</i>

37:42.845 --> 37:45.014
<i>And now I've got to pull you off.</i>

37:45.848 --> 37:48.893
- I understand.
<i>- Well, you know, I don't.</i>

37:48.976 --> 37:50.311
Her boss...

38:06.202 --> 38:08.663
Here are my notes. You write it.

38:10.247 --> 38:12.625
I caught Taylor in
an on-the-record moment I could trade

38:12.708 --> 38:14.293
and you were in trouble with your boss.

38:14.377 --> 38:15.795
And, frankly, I didn't like him.

38:15.878 --> 38:17.296
It must save you a lot of time to be able

38:17.380 --> 38:19.382
- to reach that conclusion in 15 seconds.
- It does.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.300
- But he happens to be a genius.
- Okay.

38:21.384 --> 38:24.679
And either you don't know or don't care
how insulting your favor was to me,

38:24.762 --> 38:26.389
but it's either one or the other.

38:26.472 --> 38:29.475
I'm experienced at this, Jim.
More experienced than you.

38:29.558 --> 38:30.977
I got you on the bus.

38:31.060 --> 38:33.020
And then, unbelievably,

38:33.104 --> 38:34.772
- you got us off the bus.
- Yeah.

38:34.855 --> 38:37.483
Yeah, and since you don't know
what the hell you're talking about anyway,

38:37.566 --> 38:40.069
you shouldn't make
a giant assumption that is totally wrong

38:40.152 --> 38:42.446
about my personal life or my professional life.

38:42.530 --> 38:44.073
Every... Both of them.

38:44.156 --> 38:45.825
It was the second one.
It was that I didn't care.

38:45.908 --> 38:47.201
- How insulting it was?
- Yeah.

38:47.284 --> 38:48.953
'Cause but for a couple things
that I didn't foresee,

38:49.036 --> 38:50.788
you wouldn't have found out.

38:50.871 --> 38:51.872
What the hell?

38:51.956 --> 38:56.377
Am I suddenly a fucking receptacle
for every woman who's pissed at a guy?

38:56.460 --> 38:58.713
I did a fast calculation and it was unlikely

38:58.796 --> 39:01.173
he was gonna break news
or be interviewed on camera,

39:01.257 --> 39:02.967
so I didn't think I was
robbing my network of much.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.385
You didn't need it and I did?

39:04.468 --> 39:06.303
In that call from your boss, your...

39:06.387 --> 39:08.014
- I don't know what to call him.
- Evan.

39:08.097 --> 39:11.851
I've always... I hate that name.
I did it because I wanted to.

39:11.934 --> 39:13.853
Everything about it felt right.

39:13.936 --> 39:15.771
But if it was insulting, I still don't care.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.732
I'm going downstairs.

39:25.239 --> 39:28.117
Yeah, I always hated the name Evan, too.

39:35.916 --> 39:37.460
SHELLY: <i>I'm talking about a plan.</i>

39:37.543 --> 39:41.464
This plan has come to symbolize
the struggle for justice in India.

39:41.547 --> 39:45.217
Proponents claim
that it is urgently needed development.

39:45.301 --> 39:47.678
And opponents claim that it will disrupt

39:47.762 --> 39:50.723
underprivileged communities
and service the wealthy few.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.933
What plan am I talking about?

39:54.518 --> 39:56.312
MAN: Narmada Dams!

39:57.563 --> 39:58.606
Excuse me.

40:01.609 --> 40:03.569
I'm right. It's the Narmada Dams.

40:03.652 --> 40:06.739
I can't believe
what it takes to get you to apologize.

40:06.822 --> 40:09.200
I have absolutely no intention of apologizing.

40:09.283 --> 40:10.868
But you should enjoy me while I'm here,

40:10.951 --> 40:13.079
'cause as soon as I leave,
so does the attention.

40:13.162 --> 40:14.872
Your movement sucks, Shelly.

40:14.955 --> 40:16.749
I'm sure it looks that way from the outside.

40:16.832 --> 40:18.709
And right there is your problem,
'cause who the fuck cares

40:18.793 --> 40:20.211
what it looks like from the inside?

40:20.294 --> 40:22.880
Slavery, suffrage, civil rights, Vietnam,

40:22.963 --> 40:25.424
what all those things
have in common is there were leaders.

40:25.508 --> 40:28.010
And the only thing
the leaders cared about was getting it done.

40:28.094 --> 40:30.763
And if you guys had leaders
who could find a map with a fuckin' map,

40:30.846 --> 40:33.724
they'd tell you the thing about capitalism
is it's politically accountable.

40:33.808 --> 40:35.226
Did you watch my show tonight?

40:35.309 --> 40:37.645
Did you see anybody courting the OWS vote?

40:37.728 --> 40:40.022
'Cause all eight candidates
for the Republican nomination

40:40.106 --> 40:43.442
said the words "Tea Party" today
in a bite they knew would get picked up.

40:43.526 --> 40:45.319
We're not trying to get anyone elected.

40:45.402 --> 40:48.447
We're just trying to point
so that people will look.

40:48.531 --> 40:51.033
And you're looking
at us and not what we're pointing at.

40:53.702 --> 40:56.413
I was terrible on the show.

40:56.497 --> 40:59.083
I was embarrassed in front of my friends

40:59.166 --> 41:01.293
and my students

41:01.377 --> 41:03.546
and the people in my area at Zucotti Park.

41:03.629 --> 41:06.841
If you had to slap me around, couldn't we
at least have talked about corruption,

41:06.924 --> 41:08.968
financial crimes,

41:09.051 --> 41:11.095
predatory lending,
unlimited campaign donations?

41:11.178 --> 41:13.389
You're not qualified
to talk about those things on our show.

41:13.472 --> 41:17.143
But, yes, I could talk
about those things more on our show.

41:18.811 --> 41:22.481
I slapped you around
to burnish my reputation as a moderate.

41:22.565 --> 41:25.484
You were a handy prop
and I'm sorry I embarrassed you.

41:27.570 --> 41:28.988
I'm not smug.

41:29.071 --> 41:31.532
I'm having a crisis of confidence.

41:33.242 --> 41:35.828
That's a pretty startling admission.

41:35.911 --> 41:37.663
I don't have that many people to talk to.

41:37.746 --> 41:39.331
- That's ironic.
- I know.

41:39.415 --> 41:40.958
- You're not married?
- No.

41:41.041 --> 41:43.043
- Girlfriend?
- Well...

41:43.586 --> 41:44.628
No.

41:44.712 --> 41:46.213
What was the "well"?

41:48.340 --> 41:50.843
I'll take Neal to where the guy usually is.

41:50.926 --> 41:53.345
- We found him already. We tracked him down.
- Are you for real?

41:53.429 --> 41:57.308
The interview was fun for me
and it shouldn't have been.

42:00.769 --> 42:02.354
Well, you know what my mother would say?

42:02.438 --> 42:04.190
I absolutely do not.

42:04.607 --> 42:06.400
Who are you really mad at?

42:06.483 --> 42:08.194
You really want to tug at that thread?

42:08.277 --> 42:11.572
I wouldn't be surprised
if it has something to do with the "well."

42:14.074 --> 42:16.076
Can I audit the rest of your class?

42:16.160 --> 42:18.454
- It's almost over.
- Perfect.

42:19.747 --> 42:22.875
...as she sought exoneration
in the murder of her college roommate in Italy.

42:22.958 --> 42:26.587
And tomorrow morning,
nearly four years after her initial detainment,

42:26.670 --> 42:29.423
Amanda Knox will fly back
to her hometown of Seattle.

42:29.506 --> 42:31.217
- Go.
- 77 up.

42:31.300 --> 42:33.219
- Got that locked.
- Ready 77.

42:33.302 --> 42:35.387
<i>...as the</i> Washington Post

42:35.471 --> 42:38.015
<i>that Perry's family ranch,</i>
<i>where the presidential hopeful</i>

42:38.098 --> 42:39.516

42:39.600 --> 42:42.394

42:42.478 --> 42:44.813

42:44.897 --> 42:46.065
What the hell, fellas?

42:46.148 --> 42:47.566
- You want to take it?
- No.

42:47.650 --> 42:50.361
- All right, well, Elliot wrote the copy.
- Oh, fuck you.

42:50.444 --> 42:52.029
- You approved the copy.
- And I approved.

42:52.112 --> 42:53.864
I don't know how
to tell the story without saying the name.

42:53.948 --> 42:55.366
Bullshit. You say the N-word.

42:55.449 --> 42:57.076
N-wordhead Ranch?

42:57.159 --> 42:58.911
Something like that.
What did everybody else do?

42:58.994 --> 43:00.621
- They bit around it.
- Don Lemon said it.

43:00.704 --> 43:02.915
- Don Lemon's black.
- Yeah, I don't know these rules.

43:02.998 --> 43:05.084
The story is about the word
and we decided not to play

43:05.167 --> 43:06.710
a game of Hangman with the audience.

43:06.794 --> 43:08.087
N-head Ranch? Is there a "g"?

43:08.170 --> 43:09.255
- (SNICKERS)
- Shut up.

43:09.338 --> 43:10.923
What if it said "motherfucker" on the rock?

43:11.006 --> 43:14.301
It would be a much different story
and one a lot harder to get to the bottom of.

43:14.385 --> 43:16.762
Would you wait for me a minute?
Because that's how long it's gonna take

43:16.845 --> 43:19.932
before Reese calls saying
that the Family Foundation

43:20.015 --> 43:23.435
for the Foundation of Families
is threatening to boycott our advertisers

43:23.519 --> 43:26.105
unless Elliot stops
being Jewish or something.

43:26.188 --> 43:27.690
- Can I ask?
- What?

43:27.773 --> 43:29.191
Other than that, was it a good show?

43:29.275 --> 43:31.110
- Get out.
- All right.

43:31.193 --> 43:33.779
"Upon which was painted
a derogatory epithet for an African-American."

43:33.862 --> 43:35.197
I'm sorry, I nodded off
while you were saying that.

43:35.281 --> 43:36.573
Get out!

43:39.994 --> 43:42.413
- His name is Leon Deit.
- "Deit"?

43:42.496 --> 43:43.956
Rhymes with "beet."

43:44.039 --> 43:46.458
We've been interviewing him
for about an hour and 20 minutes

43:46.542 --> 43:48.127
and we're the first ones
who've spoken to him,

43:48.210 --> 43:49.795
though he doesn't know why we are.

43:49.878 --> 43:52.464
He was working for the Commission for
Human Rights in Conflict Zones

43:52.548 --> 43:55.092
out of Islamabad
and they sent him to interview

43:55.175 --> 43:57.469
some people in Waziristan
who said they'd survived a raid

43:57.553 --> 44:00.806
of what they say were US military forces.

44:00.889 --> 44:02.349
He wrote this report.

44:02.433 --> 44:05.185
He believes that as a result of this report,

44:05.269 --> 44:07.146
his NGO was shut down.

44:07.229 --> 44:08.397
Have you read it?

44:10.399 --> 44:13.986
Name some signs a person would exhibit
if they'd been exposed to sarin gas.

44:14.111 --> 44:16.780
Vomiting, severe muscle twitches,

44:16.864 --> 44:19.325
and then death by choking
on their own vomit.

44:19.408 --> 44:22.119
Read what I've highlighted on the third page.

44:24.330 --> 44:26.498
"Villagers report that many of the dead

44:26.582 --> 44:29.460
"seem to have aspirated into their mouths

44:32.087 --> 44:35.257
"and had been asphyxiated
by their own vomit."

45:00.324 --> 45:03.702
Was it absolutely necessary
for you to tell my boss?

45:04.870 --> 45:07.623
I wouldn't say it was necessary,

45:08.290 --> 45:10.834
but it was what anyone would do in my job.

45:11.126 --> 45:15.506
And the reason you don't know that
is because you've never done this before.

45:16.590 --> 45:19.510
You know, we're doing this thing, Jim.

45:19.593 --> 45:21.387
We're running for president.

45:21.470 --> 45:22.638
It's on.

45:23.931 --> 45:26.141
And it's a big, hard thing

45:26.975 --> 45:30.646
and we understand
that we're gonna have to do it

45:30.729 --> 45:33.565
during a relentless onslaught

45:33.649 --> 45:37.069
of absurd bullshit from you and your friends.

45:37.152 --> 45:39.488
It was just my way of saying that

45:39.571 --> 45:41.949
we're gonna be around for a while.

45:42.032 --> 45:43.659
Perry's done.

45:44.618 --> 45:46.912
It's not the ranch that's gonna get him.

45:46.995 --> 45:48.789
It's his intellect.

45:50.332 --> 45:53.919
Not the world's worst reason
for a Republican candidate to lose.

45:54.002 --> 45:56.422
I wonder if anyone's gonna notice that.

45:58.632 --> 46:01.844
I know I'm gonna
see you somewhere again before November.

46:02.970 --> 46:04.513
Take it easy.

46:06.181 --> 46:07.724
Take it easy, Taylor.

46:12.938 --> 46:14.773
You were lying before.

46:17.526 --> 46:19.570
About the fast calculation you did.

46:21.363 --> 46:23.157
It was a big deal.

46:25.909 --> 46:27.953
I think you got in trouble.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.335
You have to go back to New York.

46:38.672 --> 46:39.882
Yeah.

46:43.218 --> 46:44.386
Well,

46:46.763 --> 46:48.557
I don't like that.

46:53.353 --> 46:55.397
It's all right 'cause I...

47:02.321 --> 47:03.697
I'm the rebound.

47:05.407 --> 47:07.284
And I went to Vassar.

47:09.369 --> 47:12.164
I think that Vassar
has a really strong hold on you

47:12.247 --> 47:15.959

have a lot of anxiety about living up...

47:28.764 --> 47:31.934

What do I... Here's what I'm asking.

47:35.896 --> 47:38.690

General Stomtonovich to not be discounted?

Sometime... I didn't look at my watch,

47:52.829 --> 47:55.749
but the police report
said it was sometime after midnight,

47:55.832 --> 47:58.627
- we heard some...
- I heard. Don't say we.

48:00.379 --> 48:02.881
I heard a popping sound in the distance.

49:37.768 --> 49:39.645
