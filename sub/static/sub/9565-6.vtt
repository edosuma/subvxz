WEBVTT

00:00.097 --> 00:01.320
{\a3}You want it. Yeah.

00:04.082 --> 00:06.040
{\a3}Why can't you get better for me?

00:06.286 --> 00:09.480
{\a3}We had so much and
it's all fucked up forever.

00:09.686 --> 00:11.160
{\a3}I'm so lonely.

00:11.366 --> 00:12.640
{\a3}I know.

00:14.809 --> 00:16.520
{\a3}Do you remember when you
rode with me

00:16.680 --> 00:18.806
{\a3}in the ambulance
after I tried to kill myself?

00:18.926 --> 00:19.926
{\a3}Of course.

00:20.846 --> 00:23.000
{\a3}That's what love feels like.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.360
{\a3}What are you doing?

00:28.995 --> 00:31.520
{\a3}Lovely Sid
and lovely Michelle are fucking.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.119
{\a3}We're not... Not in the
way you're thinking.

01:25.566 --> 01:26.566
Effy?

01:32.692 --> 01:33.846
What's wrong?

01:34.240 --> 01:35.526
It keeps happening.

01:35.646 --> 01:37.459
OK. Lie down.

01:40.678 --> 01:42.566
- Do you mind?
- No.

01:43.466 --> 01:45.292
I like this story, anyway.

01:45.636 --> 01:46.640
Thanks.

01:50.718 --> 01:53.476
"Orpheus was the greatest
poet who ever lived.

01:53.596 --> 01:55.252
"His music was so beautiful

01:55.372 --> 01:57.846
that when he played
rivers would stop flowing,

01:57.966 --> 02:00.014
"winds would stop blowing,

02:00.406 --> 02:01.926
"and the skies would open up

02:02.046 --> 02:05.696
"so his wondrous melodies could
be heard by the Gods in heaven.

02:07.069 --> 02:11.641
"One day, his wife Eurydice
was bitten to death by vipers.

02:14.436 --> 02:16.126
"Overcome with grief,

02:16.246 --> 02:19.196
"Orpheus played
heartbreaking songs on his lyre.

02:20.646 --> 02:22.196
<i>"The Gods were moved,</i>

02:22.526 --> 02:25.876
<i>"and so advised Orpheus
to travel to the land of the dead</i>

02:26.166 --> 02:29.808
<i>"and sing his songs to Hades
to bargain for his wife.</i>

02:31.926 --> 02:35.120
<i>"So it was
that Hades' heart was softened.</i>

02:35.776 --> 02:38.366
<i>"And he allowed Eurydices
to leave on one condition -</i>

02:39.293 --> 02:41.479
<i>"that Orpheus would walk in front</i>

02:41.720 --> 02:43.406
<i>"and never look back."</i>

02:45.837 --> 02:48.529
- Hey! Here he is!
- Looking good, mate.

02:48.649 --> 02:49.959
Cheers. I feel quite good.

02:52.511 --> 02:54.688
Eh. What's going on here, then?

02:55.485 --> 02:58.040
Ah you know, man...
The winds of change.

02:58.315 --> 02:59.725
Rivers of blood and all that.

02:59.845 --> 03:02.000
Shit getting wild, man.
Him and her,

03:02.160 --> 03:03.480
Sid and Michelle...

03:03.640 --> 03:05.919
- Ow! Easy, man.
- Yeah. Where is Sid?

03:06.080 --> 03:07.428
He came early...

03:07.548 --> 03:08.574
with Michelle.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.720
- All right?
- It's loud.

03:31.369 --> 03:32.702
You all right?

03:32.822 --> 03:34.040
What do you mean?

03:35.389 --> 03:37.120
You look a bit...

03:37.766 --> 03:38.766
I'm fine.

03:39.688 --> 03:42.086
Loudest club in the west, mate.
You gonna be all right?

03:42.206 --> 03:43.656
Yeah. I'll be fine.

03:47.465 --> 03:48.580
Hey, Tony...

03:49.120 --> 03:50.640
Hey, Cass. Are we going somewhere?

03:50.886 --> 03:51.886
Oh, yes...

03:57.316 --> 04:00.103
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'm totally ready.

04:13.809 --> 04:15.783
Isn't that sweet?

04:15.903 --> 04:17.680
I'm sad about them.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.240
Aren't you?

04:21.308 --> 04:22.690
I'm fine and dandy.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.980
Good. We're just fine and dandy...

04:29.262 --> 04:31.320
Come on.
You can buy me a drink.

04:37.847 --> 04:40.765
I think that since Sid and Michelle
are together,

04:41.239 --> 04:42.885
we should do the same.

04:43.206 --> 04:44.527
What, go out?

04:44.647 --> 04:46.086
Yeah!

04:46.206 --> 04:48.406
Get dressed up?
Go on a date?

04:48.526 --> 04:49.526
Yeah!

04:49.880 --> 04:51.526
And we'd talk and eat dim sum,

04:51.646 --> 04:54.258
- and I'd take you home...
- And I'd walk you upstairs...

04:54.378 --> 04:56.893
But I'd knock my head on the door
frame and fall down.

04:57.013 --> 04:58.446
I'd get the witch hazel.

04:58.787 --> 05:00.208
And I'd say, "Witch hazel?

05:00.328 --> 05:02.676
"What are you, 90?
Get some fucking painkillers."

05:02.796 --> 05:05.766
And I'd say, "Hey, it's
an excellent astringent,

05:05.886 --> 05:07.239
"and we're out of aspirin."

05:07.425 --> 05:10.286
I'd turn the argument
into a good, hard, angry fuck.

05:10.406 --> 05:12.726
Well, that's where we might
have a problem.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.196
What do you mean?

05:14.368 --> 05:15.368
I've got...

05:15.722 --> 05:18.141
a bit of a problem in
the downstairs department.

05:18.326 --> 05:19.239
What?

05:19.686 --> 05:21.606
You know, downstairs.

05:21.726 --> 05:23.086
What?! Where?!

05:23.206 --> 05:24.656
Oh, for fuck's sake!

05:24.926 --> 05:26.959
- My cock doesn't work!
- What?

05:27.120 --> 05:28.670
My cock doesn't work!

05:40.926 --> 05:41.967
Hi...

05:42.826 --> 05:44.552
He's watching us.

05:49.826 --> 05:51.587
We can't help it, Sid.

05:52.714 --> 05:53.655
No.

05:59.477 --> 06:01.200
It's OK, isn't it?

06:01.982 --> 06:03.227
Isn't it?

06:04.470 --> 06:06.840
It's fine. We're fine.

06:07.926 --> 06:08.926
Fine.

06:09.206 --> 06:10.126
OK?

06:10.246 --> 06:12.640
- I'm fine...
- And dandy...

06:17.846 --> 06:20.163
Whoa! Here it comes...

06:21.380 --> 06:24.760
Oh, I've missed this.
Fucking hell, I've missed this...

06:27.806 --> 06:29.000
I feel good!

06:29.576 --> 06:32.206
Yes, but take it easy, Tony.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.456
I feel so...

06:34.867 --> 06:36.360
fucking good!

06:36.822 --> 06:38.080
What about our date?

06:40.646 --> 06:41.796
You all right?

06:42.360 --> 06:46.000
I'm balalaika, feathered up,
and ready to rock da party!

06:46.246 --> 06:47.360
Yeah, boy!

07:31.086 --> 07:34.568
Dude. I can't believe you're going
out with Michelle.

07:35.056 --> 07:36.806
It just kind of happened.

07:36.926 --> 07:38.286
But you're... you know.

07:39.046 --> 07:39.850
What?

07:39.970 --> 07:41.767
Well, you're not exactly...

07:42.326 --> 07:44.076
Not exactly what, exactly?

07:44.770 --> 07:46.646
Not exactly, you know.

07:46.846 --> 07:49.596
A player, a don,
an R Kelly, a baby daddy...

07:49.966 --> 07:51.086
All right. I get it.

07:51.206 --> 07:53.402
A smooth criminal,
a president of the USA,

07:53.522 --> 07:55.347
a buddha buddha buddha
cheese buddha.

07:56.086 --> 07:57.086
Hey, Sid.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.600
- Er... You having a good evening?
- I'm just marvellous, Sidney.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.759
Like hell on Earth in here.
Glorious.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.121
Yourself?

08:08.446 --> 08:10.086
Er, yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

08:10.206 --> 08:12.676
Excellent!
Vibrant! Superb!

08:12.949 --> 08:14.399
So glad to hear it!

08:15.629 --> 08:18.000
- Tony, are you OK?
- I'm top-notch, buddy.

08:18.794 --> 08:20.320
Enjoying your night out?

08:21.966 --> 08:22.839
Me too.

08:40.909 --> 08:42.341
Hey, Nips.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.199
- Don't call her Nips, Tony.
- Why, what you gonna do?

08:46.134 --> 08:48.200
I'm, uh, objecting.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.239
Strongly.

08:50.726 --> 08:52.839
- Come on...
- Tony, what are you doing?

08:53.049 --> 08:55.599
Isn't she pretty, hey man?

08:59.120 --> 09:00.115
Tony.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.359
You two make such a sweet couple!

09:02.545 --> 09:06.039
Out of all the world's famous
lovers - Anthony and Cleopatra...

09:06.880 --> 09:08.791
Taylor and Burton,
Jordan and Peter...

09:08.911 --> 09:09.986
Stop it.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.360
Bert and Ernie...

09:11.924 --> 09:13.560
I would say that you two are

09:13.720 --> 09:16.526
quite possibly the greatest snog
history has so far encountered.

09:16.646 --> 09:19.086
What is wrong with you, Tony?
Are you OK?

09:19.305 --> 09:21.999
What is it with you people
and the concept of OK?

09:22.161 --> 09:25.839
I mean, we're a fucking threesome,
aren't we? You know... peas in a pod.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.999
A fucking family, that's what we are.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.319
D'you need to sit down?

09:29.559 --> 09:30.559
Just calm down.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.270
No... I need to...
I don't... I've got...

09:35.620 --> 09:36.937
I need to go...

09:39.319 --> 09:40.319
Out of my way!

10:03.863 --> 10:05.890
It's a panic attack. That's all.

10:06.486 --> 10:07.641
What?

10:08.606 --> 10:11.356
It sounds like you're
having a panic attack.

10:11.566 --> 10:14.141
I can't breathe, I can't...

10:14.261 --> 10:17.636
Maybe it's because you
wanna fuck your sister.

10:17.766 --> 10:18.566
What?

10:18.686 --> 10:20.836
Do you want to fuck your sister?

10:21.006 --> 10:23.028
No! Jesus!

10:23.486 --> 10:26.006
It's just people say panic
attacks come from some deeply

10:26.126 --> 10:28.276
repressed sexual urges. You know?

10:29.718 --> 10:30.520
What?

10:30.806 --> 10:33.056
I was just testing a theory, see.

10:36.486 --> 10:40.036
Actually, I'm talking shit,
cos it turns out a panic attack's

10:40.185 --> 10:43.326
just a fuckload of adrenaline
mainlining into your heart.

10:43.446 --> 10:45.596
It's just how we deal with danger.

10:46.486 --> 10:48.882
Fight or flight, they call it.
Right?

10:49.488 --> 10:50.680
I don't know you.

10:50.840 --> 10:53.119
Are you a fighter or a
flighter, Tony Stonem?

10:54.646 --> 10:56.696
Cos depending on your answer...

10:57.086 --> 10:58.086
well...

10:58.366 --> 11:00.316
A lot depends on your answer.

11:02.549 --> 11:03.999
I'll see you around.

12:38.368 --> 12:40.320
Hi, Effy. How are you?

12:40.916 --> 12:43.160
I'm fine.
How are you?

12:45.086 --> 12:46.086
Good.

12:46.486 --> 12:48.936
Is Tony here?
We need to speak to him.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.755
Tea? Coffee, anyone?

13:06.875 --> 13:08.766
- Er... no, thanks.
- Er, no, I'm fine.

13:08.886 --> 13:09.806
Tony?

13:09.926 --> 13:11.076
No, thank you.

13:15.610 --> 13:18.274
You OK, Tony?
You seem a little under...

13:18.726 --> 13:20.176
well, under the bed.

13:20.726 --> 13:21.726
I'm fine.

13:23.166 --> 13:24.416
Tony, come out.

13:24.646 --> 13:25.996
I'd prefer not to.

13:26.966 --> 13:29.616
Listen.
I think we need to talk about this.

13:30.225 --> 13:32.286
I really don't know what you mean.

13:32.406 --> 13:34.239
Well, me and Sid are together now.

13:34.902 --> 13:36.523
Yeah.
I know.

13:37.006 --> 13:39.256
And you're obviously not OK with it.

13:39.966 --> 13:41.316
Who says I'm not?

13:41.846 --> 13:44.548
Well, er, you did, pretty much.
Last night.

13:44.668 --> 13:47.286
Oh, come on.
I was only taking the piss.

13:47.406 --> 13:49.256
You know...
cos it's funny?

13:51.606 --> 13:53.679
Listen, do you mind?
I've got an interview.

13:54.485 --> 13:55.726
Got to get ready.

13:55.846 --> 13:59.204
All right.
Oh, OK. See you later, Tone.

14:05.406 --> 14:06.406
Bye, Tony.

14:10.966 --> 14:11.966
Bye.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.033
Fuck!

14:33.065 --> 14:36.220
Take this.
It's stuff. Maps and shit.

14:36.566 --> 14:37.566
OK.

14:39.240 --> 14:42.119
You look really good, Tony.
Like you're ready for anything.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.235
Thanks. See you later.

15:39.871 --> 15:41.608
I'm gonna tell you a story.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.335
A bloke,

15:47.606 --> 15:49.256
he wakes up one morning.

15:49.665 --> 15:52.126
He gets dressed.
He goes down the stairs.

15:52.246 --> 15:54.896
He makes himself a
little bit of breakfast.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.446
He walks to the garage,
he gets in his car.

15:57.917 --> 16:00.846
He starts his car. Drives off,
I don't know, a couple of miles.

16:00.966 --> 16:02.616
Stops. Gets out his car.

16:03.172 --> 16:06.536
Has a couple of blokes pour
petrol over his head and...

16:07.398 --> 16:09.122
Sets fire to himself.

16:10.625 --> 16:11.809
He... What?

16:11.929 --> 16:14.200
He sets fire to himself.
Fucking boom!

16:21.086 --> 16:22.436
What's in the bag?

16:24.446 --> 16:25.596
My sandwiches.

16:26.246 --> 16:27.496
So what we got?

16:31.760 --> 16:33.719
Ham and cheese, chicken,
or egg and cress.

16:33.966 --> 16:35.216
Egg and cress...

16:36.793 --> 16:38.716
Isn't life wonderful?

16:53.606 --> 16:54.880
You looking?

16:55.731 --> 16:57.472
I don't... what?

16:58.046 --> 16:59.696
Few scars, few marks...

17:03.806 --> 17:05.556
What do you think of them?

17:06.297 --> 17:07.759
I think they're horrible.

17:07.919 --> 17:09.960
At least I got 'em, mate.
Cos I fucking wear 'em.

17:11.348 --> 17:12.406
Right...

17:12.526 --> 17:13.776
How about you?

17:14.326 --> 17:16.175
Do you... have any marks?

17:16.345 --> 17:18.920
- No. I'm fine.
- Oh, yeah, course you are...

17:20.089 --> 17:21.638
You're fine and dandy.

17:24.486 --> 17:25.599
Right?

17:33.039 --> 17:34.496
Egg and cress...

17:37.646 --> 17:39.596
It's a little fucking miracle.

18:30.446 --> 18:33.973
18 years old. The age of opportunity.

18:34.926 --> 18:37.076
I bet you can't wait to come here!

18:37.443 --> 18:40.566
Imagine it... being able to
live away from your parents and

18:40.686 --> 18:45.120
you can do anything you like, like
stay up all night and eat ice cream!

18:46.286 --> 18:47.286
Derek.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.371
Thanks, Polly.
So.

18:50.806 --> 18:54.689
New home, new friends, new horizons.

18:55.321 --> 18:57.286
The good times, the bad times...

18:57.406 --> 18:59.319
The parties...
oh, my God, the parties!

18:59.606 --> 19:03.280
The loves that will never be,
even though they seem so right.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.320
Just remember though,
that if you will drink -

19:07.480 --> 19:09.558
and personally
I have a bitter lemon...

19:12.719 --> 19:16.899
But if you do, just don't over-do it,
or you won't be able to get up

19:17.019 --> 19:19.120
in the morning for your lectures!

19:21.358 --> 19:25.190
So, any more questions
before group sessions?

19:25.566 --> 19:27.616
Are you two shagging or what?

19:33.058 --> 19:34.867
No, we're not.

19:35.808 --> 19:39.991
I adore Derek to bits.
But he's more like a brother.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.879
But you'll make friends
like that here too.

19:43.428 --> 19:45.479
Friends who appreciate
that you never,

19:45.726 --> 19:47.876
never, never want that to happen.

19:49.046 --> 19:51.172
So... No.

19:51.966 --> 19:54.016
We're certainly not doing that.

19:56.246 --> 19:57.996
No. We're not... We're...

19:59.446 --> 20:00.446
truly not.

20:02.806 --> 20:05.637
Any more questions before...
Thank you.

21:04.366 --> 21:07.516
You know, if you don't
work together, then you'll...

21:11.165 --> 21:12.280
You're late.

21:12.686 --> 21:14.520
Sorry... I couldn't find the room.

21:15.506 --> 21:17.879
And yet everybody else
seems to have managed,

21:18.166 --> 21:20.000
which I find kind of spooky,
really.

21:21.726 --> 21:22.726
Sorry.

21:24.486 --> 21:25.486
Please...

21:29.145 --> 21:32.486
So. Whilst you were
meandering around the corridors,

21:32.606 --> 21:34.355
we were introducing ourselves.

21:34.475 --> 21:37.772
Martin, you were telling us
what you did on your gap year?

21:38.046 --> 21:41.719
Yeah... As I was saying, I spent
most of my time in Central America.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.399
You know, building bridges

21:43.561 --> 21:47.085
of the real,
and the symbolic variety.

21:47.205 --> 21:48.720
You know, just really teaching

21:48.880 --> 21:51.280
the people out there
out there the value of teamwork.

21:51.566 --> 21:54.145
So 6,000 years of tribal society,

21:54.265 --> 21:57.396
they still hadn't managed to grasp
the rudiments of teamwork.

21:57.606 --> 22:01.123
Sloppy. They must have been
delighted that you showed up.

22:08.478 --> 22:10.486
- You next.
- Me?

22:10.606 --> 22:12.816
Yes, yes, you. Enlighten us. Do.

22:14.646 --> 22:15.646
Um, OK.

22:17.486 --> 22:18.736
I'm Tony Stonem.

22:19.181 --> 22:21.154
I go to college...
I live in...

22:21.274 --> 22:24.356
I actually said enlighten us,
don't bore us, Mr Stonem.

22:24.598 --> 22:27.879
Speak about yourself, about your
motives, your drive, your animus.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.177
Don't know what
animus means, do you?

22:34.559 --> 22:37.470
- Yes. I know what it means.
- Well, I'm relieved.

22:37.665 --> 22:39.587
You see because at this university,

22:39.707 --> 22:41.600
we don't have room
for the inarticulate.

22:44.046 --> 22:45.399
I think I'd better go, then.

22:46.276 --> 22:47.240
Bye.

22:53.206 --> 22:55.000
Good.
So Tony, you were about to tell us

22:55.120 --> 22:56.996
just how extremely clever you are.

22:58.286 --> 23:01.546
- I'm not that clever.
- Oh, he's clever all right.

23:02.591 --> 23:03.867
Really?

23:05.006 --> 23:07.736
Touching.
Sadly lacking in substance.

23:08.607 --> 23:12.635
At our university you have to have
verve, a sense of charisma -

23:13.286 --> 23:14.736
intellectual thrust.

23:14.856 --> 23:18.055
And that's what we're here to do
this afternoon, is find out whether

23:18.175 --> 23:19.563
you're a giver.

23:19.683 --> 23:22.816
- Whether you're...
- Willing to sleep with the lecturers?

23:24.760 --> 23:27.359
- I'm sorry?
- I was just making the point, sir,

23:27.479 --> 23:31.074
that you've been screwing every girl
in here with your eyes since we arrived,

23:31.194 --> 23:34.731
which suggests that
sex ranks higher than substance.

23:34.979 --> 23:36.716
And I'll pass, thanks.

23:37.329 --> 23:40.879
You see, I don't really find
intellectual thrust that sexy...

23:41.971 --> 23:43.799
Or fake tan, for that matter.

23:44.982 --> 23:47.066
Oh, you think that's funny, do you?

23:48.006 --> 23:50.345
- It's possibly funny...
- Possibly funny.

23:50.465 --> 23:52.763
The thing is,
I don't actually have to put up...

23:52.883 --> 23:55.320
OK. Cool.
See you!

24:00.077 --> 24:02.965
I think you should join her.
Don't you, Tony?

24:09.566 --> 24:10.566
Toodle-oo.

24:16.566 --> 24:17.566
You.

24:30.066 --> 24:32.256
You really fucked up in there.

24:32.376 --> 24:36.026
I really fucked up? Wait,
what are you even doing here, anyway?

24:36.146 --> 24:37.596
Same thing you are.

24:49.991 --> 24:52.101
Wow! Check it out.

24:53.801 --> 24:56.249
Ah... Shall we?

24:57.226 --> 24:59.826
No. No way. First of all,

24:59.946 --> 25:02.506
I can't really swim very well
any more and secondly...

25:02.626 --> 25:03.776
Ahh, boo-hoo.

25:08.696 --> 25:09.946
What the fuck?!

25:10.627 --> 25:11.960
I told you, I can't...

25:14.072 --> 25:15.506
I can't... Can't swim...

25:15.626 --> 25:17.430
Oh, you're such a pussy.

25:21.636 --> 25:22.666
I can't.

25:22.786 --> 25:25.626
You just don't want to. Lie back.

25:26.674 --> 25:28.014
That's it.

25:28.986 --> 25:29.986
You're OK.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.240
It's easy.

25:34.736 --> 25:36.119
Just float.

26:00.946 --> 26:01.996
Excuse me.

26:04.356 --> 26:06.141
Come here, please.

26:13.983 --> 26:16.186
Come on... Bit naughty.

26:16.306 --> 26:17.677
Never mind.

26:17.935 --> 26:19.356
Up you come.

26:30.307 --> 26:32.646
- Tony - is that right?
- Yes.

26:33.266 --> 26:36.645
Now, Tony, the thing is, we're not
really supposed to go in the pool.

26:36.765 --> 26:38.946
It's really only
for sporting events.

26:39.066 --> 26:40.959
And the Super Irony Fun Splash Club.

26:41.121 --> 26:43.896
And the Super Irony
Fun Splash Club, too.

26:44.321 --> 26:45.919
You're supposed to be on the tour.

26:46.637 --> 26:48.466
There was this girl, but she's gone.

26:48.586 --> 26:50.599
Don't go with her, Tony.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.520
- What?
- You should join us.

26:54.075 --> 26:55.160
What?

26:55.321 --> 26:58.171
Yes. We'll find you
somewhere you can dry off.

26:58.841 --> 27:01.594
You should get out of
those wet clothes, too.

27:02.005 --> 27:04.839
I'd really like to see
you out of those clothes.

27:06.812 --> 27:08.160
I'll lend you my cagoule.

27:10.026 --> 27:11.976
I'm all right, thanks. Just...

27:12.529 --> 27:13.617
I'm all right.

27:17.525 --> 27:19.719
Built in 1972, then
demolished the following year

27:19.881 --> 27:21.928
before being rebuilt in 85,

27:22.363 --> 27:24.776
the Bulwer-Lytton building
is a classic example

27:24.896 --> 27:27.746
of the late modernist,
post-Bauhaus development

27:27.866 --> 27:30.816
from humanist rationalist
impulses from utility.

27:31.481 --> 27:35.057
Inspired by Alvar Aalto's signature
style, the building is built...

27:35.177 --> 27:36.056
Psst!

27:38.281 --> 27:39.479
In here. Come in here.

27:39.641 --> 27:43.491
... Social interaction and the hyper
relevance of volume as, er...

27:49.955 --> 27:51.119
I wanna talk to you.

27:52.230 --> 27:53.612
Come here, then.

27:56.955 --> 27:58.391
What are you doing?

27:59.664 --> 28:02.099
The idea is to walk across the room.

28:03.275 --> 28:05.149
The room's full of shit.

28:05.386 --> 28:06.906
This is a lab.

28:07.026 --> 28:08.476
It's an experiment.

28:10.066 --> 28:11.066
Come here.

28:14.485 --> 28:15.661
For fuck's sake.

28:20.346 --> 28:21.255
Fuck.

28:23.626 --> 28:24.626
Oh, shit!

28:32.198 --> 28:33.648
Bollocks.

28:37.379 --> 28:38.700
Well done.

28:40.451 --> 28:41.520
Well done?

28:43.106 --> 28:44.656
You got here, though.

28:46.106 --> 28:47.856
What do you want from me?

28:48.746 --> 28:51.469
Hey! Who's in there? Over here!

28:51.589 --> 28:52.639
Better run.

28:53.571 --> 28:56.520
Hey! Stop! Come back here, you!

28:57.447 --> 28:59.759
Oi! They're going down
the science block.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.725
Come back!

29:18.050 --> 29:19.466
Halls of residence.

29:19.586 --> 29:20.586
Shall we?

29:39.964 --> 29:41.205
Good afternoon.

29:41.586 --> 29:42.746
How may I help you?

29:43.136 --> 29:46.091
We're seeking shelter
from the fascist oppressors.

29:46.906 --> 29:48.056
And we're wet.

29:53.011 --> 29:55.146
Can I interest you in some hashish?

29:55.266 --> 29:56.826
I'm not really supposed to.

29:56.946 --> 29:59.146
Drugs do odd things
to me at the moment.

29:59.266 --> 30:00.916
Aren't they supposed to?

30:02.355 --> 30:03.466
This is Matt.

30:03.586 --> 30:05.079
You want a hit from the bong?

30:05.241 --> 30:07.900
He is an artist. Truly, an artist.

30:08.512 --> 30:11.128
I'm Toby. His roommate.

30:12.791 --> 30:16.746
And this is of the purest,
highest possible grade.

30:16.866 --> 30:18.016
I assure you.

30:18.423 --> 30:19.528
Cool!

30:23.657 --> 30:24.800
Bravo!

30:24.961 --> 30:26.800
All splendid fun.

30:30.901 --> 30:33.386
Polly! My little chaffinch.
How the devil are you?

30:33.506 --> 30:37.625
I'm going to pretend that
I don't smell that, Toby.

30:38.501 --> 30:40.320
Smell what, mon petit chou?

30:40.481 --> 30:42.639
It's very, very naughty
what you're doing, Toby.

30:43.876 --> 30:44.996
Quite possibly.

30:45.116 --> 30:46.719
Anyway. Have you seen a...

30:47.958 --> 30:49.466
wet boy running around here?

30:49.586 --> 30:52.066
He's lost.
And he's truly in a lot of trouble.

30:52.920 --> 30:56.369
We have witnessed no moist children

30:56.489 --> 31:00.039
of the masculine variety
gallivanting within these halls, no.

31:01.656 --> 31:03.229
Oh, hey, Poll. How's it going?

31:03.349 --> 31:04.599
Oh... Hi, Matt.

31:04.761 --> 31:06.839
You, er,
you thought about what I asked you?

31:07.229 --> 31:09.004
Yes, actually, I have...

31:09.281 --> 31:10.200
And?

31:10.897 --> 31:13.625
All right, you can shag me.
But only once.

31:14.441 --> 31:16.547
You're lucky Bruce is in Guatemala.

31:16.865 --> 31:18.917
Fine. I'll be around later.

31:32.621 --> 31:34.906
Can't allow our friends
to be naked alone, Matthew.

31:35.026 --> 31:36.576
It's just not cricket.

31:37.041 --> 31:38.091
Got ya...

31:59.853 --> 32:00.986
They're beautiful.

32:01.877 --> 32:03.369
Oh, thanks.

32:03.626 --> 32:05.314
I do them myself.

32:05.434 --> 32:06.395
Do you?

32:06.515 --> 32:07.560
Yeah.

32:08.309 --> 32:10.799
So you could do me... now?

32:11.351 --> 32:12.667
Sure...

32:14.724 --> 32:16.465
if you're up for it.

32:31.581 --> 32:33.222
Does it hurt?

32:33.826 --> 32:35.155
Beautifully.

32:39.089 --> 32:40.624
What are you getting?

32:40.744 --> 32:42.479
A mark...

32:42.641 --> 32:44.694
Passion...

32:47.385 --> 32:48.849
Want...

32:50.715 --> 32:51.878
Need...

32:59.902 --> 33:01.520
My, my.

33:03.792 --> 33:05.007
Thank you.

33:05.127 --> 33:06.476
My...

33:10.266 --> 33:11.773
My pleasure.

33:16.001 --> 33:17.551
Come and look at it.

33:21.986 --> 33:22.999
What's it like?

33:23.874 --> 33:24.946
Good.

33:25.066 --> 33:26.066
Touch it.

33:26.826 --> 33:27.626
What?

33:27.921 --> 33:29.070
Touch it.

33:37.821 --> 33:38.988
I can't do this.

33:39.108 --> 33:41.489
So many things you can't do.

33:42.768 --> 33:45.465
You can't swim, you can't run...

33:46.251 --> 33:47.839
You can't fuck.

33:49.419 --> 33:50.440
Oh, dear.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.106
How d'you know that?

33:53.226 --> 33:55.534
But you can, Tony Stonem.

33:56.004 --> 33:58.540
You can fuck me right now.

33:58.906 --> 34:01.079
- No, I couldn't.
- You want to.

34:01.241 --> 34:02.391
Hey, fuck you!

34:03.106 --> 34:05.333
I got hit by a fucking bus.
That fucks you up.

34:05.453 --> 34:06.840
Well, fuck you right back.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.706
You're just not trying hard enough.

34:08.826 --> 34:11.176
You must be so happy
the way you are.

34:11.306 --> 34:13.540
Why do you care if my dick
can get hard or not?

34:13.659 --> 34:16.000
This is fucked up beyond words.

34:16.161 --> 34:18.000
Coward. Fucking coward.

34:18.161 --> 34:18.985
Coward.

34:19.237 --> 34:20.239
Wanker.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.460
Why don't you just stop being
such a fucking pussy

34:23.672 --> 34:26.275
and let the fuck go?

34:28.667 --> 34:30.475
Fucking leave me alone!

34:49.161 --> 34:50.946
There you are.

34:51.429 --> 34:53.158
Are you OK?

34:53.386 --> 34:55.335
Look at you, you poor thing.

34:56.360 --> 35:00.106
Come with us. We'll get you some
warm clothes and a nice hot tea.

35:00.226 --> 35:03.946
The Musical Society are going to
do a performance for all of you.

35:04.204 --> 35:05.628
HMS Pinafore.

35:06.001 --> 35:08.319
# I've treacle and toffee,
I've tea and I've coffee

35:08.481 --> 35:11.115
# Soft tommy and succulent chops

35:11.666 --> 35:15.186
# So buy of your Buttercup,
Poor Little Buttercup

35:15.306 --> 35:17.456
# Come of your Buttercup, buy! #

35:18.236 --> 35:20.786
Come back!
There'll be cheese and wine.

35:20.906 --> 35:21.946
It'll be fun!

35:22.066 --> 35:24.216
There's always cheese and wine!

35:35.666 --> 35:36.980
Take a seat.

35:43.423 --> 35:45.031
Eventful day.

35:45.906 --> 35:49.079
Pissing around in pools, smashing
up labs, avoiding activities,

35:50.826 --> 35:52.746
getting up to no good in the dorms.

35:53.075 --> 35:55.466
- How'd you know what I...?
- And now you turn up

35:55.586 --> 35:57.755
for an interview like,

35:59.749 --> 36:00.955
well...

36:01.916 --> 36:04.773
You know, I'm amazed you
actually even bothered, really.

36:06.161 --> 36:07.611
But I'm a fair man,

36:08.186 --> 36:10.036
so bearing all that in mind,

36:10.626 --> 36:12.052
why don't you

36:12.866 --> 36:17.162
try to convince me into offering
you a place at this university?

36:23.226 --> 36:25.976
Oh, you think you're
so original, don't you?

36:26.786 --> 36:29.284
I have met a million kids like you.

36:29.404 --> 36:32.200
Yeah, vaguely intelligent.
Agonisingly middle-class.

36:32.361 --> 36:35.031
Read a book by Camus,
a book by Kafka.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.792
No real substance, though.

36:36.912 --> 36:39.546
Just a little
fucked-up jumble of misdirected,

36:39.666 --> 36:41.838
immature, poly-sexuality
and pure,

36:41.958 --> 36:44.200
arrogant, impotent rage.

36:49.045 --> 36:49.949
So...

36:51.306 --> 36:52.856
What you got, big boy?

36:57.040 --> 36:58.040
Get off me.

36:58.160 --> 37:01.199
You don't know a fucking thing
about me, you sanctimonious cunt.

37:01.675 --> 37:04.639
But since we're playing the guessing
game, let's make a few assumptions.

37:05.136 --> 37:08.382
A divorced, lonely, middle-aged
lecturer, who lives alone

37:08.502 --> 37:10.800
- and gets his rocks off...
- You're really fucking...

37:10.961 --> 37:14.759
Gets his fucking rocks off trying
to sleep with fucking first years.

37:14.921 --> 37:18.426
Other hobbies include intimidation
and furtive masturbation.

37:18.546 --> 37:21.537
I bet you thought you'd died
and gone to heaven when you got here.

37:21.657 --> 37:24.146
Your own office
and all the students you could eat.

37:24.266 --> 37:25.920
- Let go of me.
- Animus.

37:28.161 --> 37:30.670
It means spirit, courage,

37:31.386 --> 37:32.636
passion,

37:34.280 --> 37:35.399
wrath.

37:36.598 --> 37:37.774
This is mine.

37:43.106 --> 37:45.756
Who the fucking hell
do you think you are?

37:45.946 --> 37:47.496
I'm a bad dream, mate.

37:47.986 --> 37:50.040
I'm you before you shrivelled
and died.

37:51.564 --> 37:54.016
And I don't wanna go
where you've been.

37:56.039 --> 37:58.596
So in answer
to your earlier question,

37:59.546 --> 38:01.796
you should've given me a place here.

38:02.184 --> 38:04.519
I'd have been the best
student you'd ever had.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.057
Here he comes. Welcome back, Tony.

38:30.619 --> 38:33.069
Congratulations, Tony.
Good work, sir.

38:34.266 --> 38:35.266
Enjoy.

38:35.386 --> 38:37.386
The pleasure is all yours, sir.

38:37.506 --> 38:39.256
The pleasure is all yours.

40:43.226 --> 40:44.576
You're not coming?

40:46.930 --> 40:48.956
I think I'll stay
here for a while.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.970
It's peaceful.

40:55.666 --> 40:56.666
Go home.

41:01.466 --> 41:03.116
It was good to meet you.

41:10.986 --> 41:11.986
Thank you.

41:19.546 --> 41:21.196
Don't look back, Tony.

42:23.726 --> 42:24.770
Hey, Tone.

42:24.890 --> 42:26.556
Where are Sid and Michelle?

42:26.946 --> 42:27.946
No idea.

42:29.306 --> 42:30.746
You're a terrible liar, Jal.

42:31.053 --> 42:33.302
Anybody can see you've
got something going on.

42:42.386 --> 42:43.866
- Shit!
- Christ!

42:43.986 --> 42:45.236
What the fuck?!

42:45.356 --> 42:46.466
Tony!

42:46.719 --> 42:48.719
- What the fuck are you...?
- Shut up!

42:48.839 --> 42:51.246
- Sid, are you gonna let him?
- Tony, I'm objecting to...

42:51.366 --> 42:54.121
You're always fucking objecting!
Can't you do something?

42:54.241 --> 42:55.890
OK. OK, Jesus.

43:01.186 --> 43:02.186
Tony, what?

43:02.641 --> 43:05.519
Are you trying to scare me,
because it's not working?

43:07.506 --> 43:08.556
I love you.

43:09.519 --> 43:11.356
I'm saying it again. OK?

43:15.146 --> 43:16.146
And you.

43:16.786 --> 43:18.936
I love you too, you little fucker.

43:24.960 --> 43:27.279
This is wrong.
Can't you see it's all wrong?

43:28.946 --> 43:30.496
You're my girlfriend!

43:31.866 --> 43:33.376
And you're my best friend.

43:33.496 --> 43:35.266
- Tony, I love her.
- No, you don't.

43:35.386 --> 43:36.736
OK, maybe I don't.

43:37.360 --> 43:38.695
He loves Cassie.

43:39.306 --> 43:40.714
And you love me.

43:40.834 --> 43:42.134
That works.

43:43.204 --> 43:45.260
- We work.
- Why now?

43:45.380 --> 43:46.640
It's too late.

43:47.353 --> 43:50.160
It's always been there, Michelle.
It just took a while.

43:50.841 --> 43:52.226
I need you.

43:55.866 --> 43:57.316
You can't have her.

43:59.306 --> 44:00.538
It's wrong.

44:02.946 --> 44:03.996
It's wrong.

44:05.222 --> 44:07.246
That's all I'm trying to say.

44:46.069 --> 44:48.000
Everything's gonna be
all right, Cass.

46:44.400 --> 46:46.959
{\a3}Effy, 100% success.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.822
{\a3}My art coursework.
It's on the subject of emotion

46:49.942 --> 46:52.359
{\a3}and you seem quite emotional.
So you can do it for me.

46:52.520 --> 46:53.799
{\a3}<i>I'm Pandora. I'm new.</i>

46:54.134 --> 46:56.159
{\a3}Tell him I've discovered
the power of the pussy.

46:58.400 --> 46:59.426
{\a3}And?

46:59.960 --> 47:01.769
{\a3}I'll sort out your
fucking soap opera.

47:01.889 --> 47:04.239
{\a3}And that, ladies, is why
Monet was shit.
