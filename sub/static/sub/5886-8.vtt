00:00.073 --> 00:01.615
<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

00:01.795 --> 00:05.229
This is over,
and not just this.

00:06.152 --> 00:07.557
You should get some sleep.

00:07.729 --> 00:10.145
How can I?
My wife's a big TV star.

00:10.798 --> 00:12.849
Why didn't you tell us
Frank Gleason was dying?

00:12.960 --> 00:14.634
Frank's going to be fine.

00:14.741 --> 00:15.971
I wanted to make it clear.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.533
Unless this works,
I'm against it.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.249
Just saying the same thing.

00:23.226 --> 00:24.833
So, how'd it go?

00:24.963 --> 00:26.292
We went in together.

00:26.418 --> 00:28.149
We won Chevy.

01:07.503 --> 01:09.504
Feel that torque?

01:09.539 --> 01:11.605
It's like riding
a hard-on.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.207
Come on, floor it.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.342
My little girl's got
a heavier foot.

01:15.377 --> 01:16.977
I'm going back.

01:17.011 --> 01:18.379
Knock it off, Mikey.

01:18.413 --> 01:20.347
Go on the shoulder.
I want to shoot this sign.

01:20.382 --> 01:22.449
Put the gun away, Jack.

01:23.885 --> 01:25.586
Jesus, what the hell
are you doing?

01:38.131 --> 01:40.166
<i>Arnie, you
should eat something.</i>

01:40.201 --> 01:42.902
How about some leftover veal
and some cold pasta?

01:42.936 --> 01:45.804
<i>Want a beer, honey?</i>

01:56.583 --> 01:58.717
Chicken salad or tuna?

01:58.751 --> 02:00.484
Here come the judge.

02:00.519 --> 02:02.620
What's the difference?
Eat it.

02:05.190 --> 02:07.325
Who says we can't
hire more people?

02:07.359 --> 02:10.695
Why don't you take a nap? Your
face looks like a bag of walnuts.

02:12.163 --> 02:13.797
Everyone should take a rest.

02:13.832 --> 02:15.432
It's an easy thing
to say, isn't it?

02:15.466 --> 02:17.100
You're not thinking.
You're not writing.

02:17.134 --> 02:19.035
Ted, calm down.
You need a nap, too.

02:19.069 --> 02:20.337
Can you believe this crap?

02:20.371 --> 02:21.871
Yes, I can.

02:24.742 --> 02:25.908
Sorry I'm late.

02:25.943 --> 02:27.844
You're sorry you're late?

02:27.878 --> 02:29.879
You couldn't call?

02:29.913 --> 02:31.913
He called.
I told you there's no news.

02:31.948 --> 02:33.349
You did not make that clear.

02:33.383 --> 02:36.285
You really didn't.
You just said "no news."

02:36.319 --> 02:38.220
You didn't say Kenny called in.

02:38.255 --> 02:40.356
- Pow.
- Damn it.

02:40.390 --> 02:42.358
No one cares
that I almost got killed?

02:42.392 --> 02:43.659
What did they say?

02:43.693 --> 02:47.262
It's just like last time, no.

02:47.296 --> 02:49.830
- What does that mean?
- It means they didn't like it.

02:49.865 --> 02:53.668
Then they got drunk, they took
me for a joyride in the Impala.

02:53.702 --> 02:55.903
Why can't we have the Impala?

02:55.937 --> 02:57.472
What did they say?

02:57.506 --> 03:00.341
They said they didn't like 'em.

03:01.744 --> 03:03.610
It's your job to make
them like them.

03:03.645 --> 03:05.579
- Are you not up to the task?
- Don.

03:05.613 --> 03:08.848
What? We've given them seven
ways to go in six weeks.

03:08.883 --> 03:10.550
We don't even get
to talk to them?

03:10.585 --> 03:13.052
We have to depend
on this cripple?

03:13.087 --> 03:14.488
You don't know
what he's up against.

03:14.522 --> 03:16.823
I've got to sit down,
but I'm not gonna

03:16.857 --> 03:18.692
if you're just gonna
continue to insult me.

03:19.693 --> 03:21.494
Just sit down.

03:21.528 --> 03:23.228
They gave me this

03:23.263 --> 03:24.863
and I can't even
show it to you.

03:24.898 --> 03:26.932
What is it?
They typed up their rejection?

03:26.966 --> 03:28.867
It's worse.

03:28.902 --> 03:30.235
They finally gave me
a calendar.

03:30.270 --> 03:32.371
Three years
of monthly deadlines.

03:32.406 --> 03:34.640
That's the rest
of '68, '69, and '70.

03:34.675 --> 03:37.875
Best case scenario, six months
of strategy statements,

03:37.910 --> 03:39.811
every one of them
backed up with copy tests.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.646
<i>And then, if and when</i>
<i>they land on something,</i>

03:41.681 --> 03:43.648
it's got to kick its way up
the ladder through all of GM

03:43.683 --> 03:45.216
until it gets to God.

03:45.250 --> 03:47.118
And then He's got to
run it past His wife.

03:47.152 --> 03:48.687
So what happens now?

03:48.721 --> 03:50.822
You take a swing at it
and they take a swing at me.

03:50.856 --> 03:53.089
They want another packet
Tuesday morning.

03:53.124 --> 03:55.959
- But they want me back on Sunday.
- For what?

03:55.993 --> 03:57.661
I guarantee you
they're not going to church.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.930
We cannot go on like this.

03:59.964 --> 04:01.932
This is what Chevy
is paying us for.

04:01.966 --> 04:03.767
It's not our clock,
it's theirs.

04:03.802 --> 04:05.436
So what's another weekend?

04:05.470 --> 04:07.403
Because they're
really paying us.

04:07.438 --> 04:10.206
Mr. Chaough,
you have a phone call.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.574
Take a message.

04:11.608 --> 04:14.210
It's Nan.
It's about that matter.

04:21.618 --> 04:23.285
Excuse me, Mr. Draper.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.920
Get all the Chevy materials
back in my office.

04:25.955 --> 04:28.590
- We're working the weekend.
- Yes, of course.

04:28.624 --> 04:30.759
But I wanted to tell you
Dr. Rosen is on the phone.

04:32.261 --> 04:34.996
- Do you want me to take a message?
- Yes.

04:35.030 --> 04:38.199
- I'll find out what it's regarding.
- No.

04:38.234 --> 04:40.701
I'll take it.

04:40.736 --> 04:42.936
You know what, Don?
That's a great idea.

04:42.971 --> 04:46.240
I'm gonna call my doctor.
I'm gonna get Kenny here fixed up.

04:46.274 --> 04:48.909
I'm gonna get
everybody fixed up.

04:57.618 --> 04:58.951
Arnold, how are you?

04:58.986 --> 05:00.520
It's me.

05:00.554 --> 05:02.188
Um...

05:03.991 --> 05:05.792
I'm glad to hear that.

05:05.826 --> 05:07.960
Oh, I bet you are,

05:07.995 --> 05:10.397
because I wanted to let you know
that's what that would feel like.

05:10.431 --> 05:12.230
I thought I misunderstood.

05:12.265 --> 05:13.699
Oh, bullshit.

05:13.733 --> 05:16.067
You have got to stop
loitering in my hallway.

05:16.102 --> 05:17.969
Sylvia, I'm glad you called.

05:18.004 --> 05:20.406
He saw all the cigarette
butts out there

05:20.440 --> 05:21.940
and he thinks
I'm smoking again.

05:21.974 --> 05:23.509
I want to see you.

05:23.543 --> 05:25.377
I was in the kitchen
biting my nails

05:25.412 --> 05:27.312
thinking,
"I just cleaned it up."

05:27.346 --> 05:29.280
How many nights
are you out there?

05:29.314 --> 05:31.215
I know you want to see me, too.

05:31.249 --> 05:33.050
All I kept thinking
is he's gonna come in

05:33.084 --> 05:34.886
and ask my why
there's no lipstick on them

05:34.920 --> 05:37.688
and I'm gonna burst into tears
and tell him everything.

05:37.723 --> 05:40.090
Then he's gonna murder me
and murder you.

05:40.125 --> 05:42.760
- Are you afraid of him?
- No.

05:42.795 --> 05:44.594
I'm afraid of you.

05:44.629 --> 05:47.130
I don't think you understand.

05:49.600 --> 05:54.070
Look, I'm too old
to say this was a mistake,

05:54.104 --> 05:56.372
but I want you to try
and be happy.

05:56.407 --> 05:58.341
About what?

05:58.375 --> 06:00.309
<i>That you got away with it.</i>

06:00.343 --> 06:02.711
When you start
something like this,

06:02.746 --> 06:05.047
it takes a lot of convincing.

06:05.081 --> 06:07.850
It's all about whether
or not the other person

06:07.884 --> 06:09.752
has as much to lose as you do,

06:09.786 --> 06:12.688
because you want to be able
to trust them when it's over.

06:12.722 --> 06:16.425
And right now I'm wondering
how I ever trusted you.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.961
<i>I don't really have</i>
<i>a choice, do I,</i>

06:18.995 --> 06:20.795
<i>because you've got me.</i>

06:20.830 --> 06:24.532
So if you ever really cared
about me at all, knock it off.

06:24.567 --> 06:27.202
Don't cry.
Just listen to me.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.940
I'm feeling a lot
of emotions, too.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.475
I'm hanging up.

06:34.509 --> 06:36.710
Please, just listen.

06:38.313 --> 06:41.082
I just want to talk
to you about a few things.

06:41.116 --> 06:43.317
You loved Megan once.

06:43.352 --> 06:46.420
- Stop it.
- Nothing else gets through to you.

06:48.356 --> 06:50.156
I'm going.

06:52.860 --> 06:55.295
Don't make me hang up on you.

06:58.699 --> 07:00.733
I'm hanging up.

07:18.551 --> 07:20.584
<i>Mr. Draper?</i>

07:24.556 --> 07:26.957
<i>Mr. Draper?</i>

07:28.260 --> 07:30.094
<i>I'm gonna go in there.</i>

07:30.129 --> 07:32.796
- Yes?
- <i>Is everything okay?</i>

07:34.199 --> 07:36.333
Yes, I'm fine.

07:36.367 --> 07:38.868
I'm gonna...

07:40.638 --> 07:42.739
I'm tired.
I'm just gonna take a nap.

07:42.773 --> 07:44.908
<i>You do that.</i>

08:04.894 --> 08:06.328
You girls should back away.

08:09.565 --> 08:11.132
Does he have a fever?

08:16.439 --> 08:17.972
You get your bedroll.

08:18.006 --> 08:20.007
You stay in here,
you'll get everybody sick.

08:20.042 --> 08:23.744
- You sleep in the cellar.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:23.779 --> 08:26.213
If the fever doesn't break,
we'll call a doctor.

08:26.247 --> 08:27.981
Better for you
than for everyone.

08:32.220 --> 08:36.623
AimÃ©e, did you leave
that plate in the lounge?

08:36.657 --> 08:39.626
<i>Mr. Draper?</i>

08:41.462 --> 08:44.263
Yes, what is it?

08:44.298 --> 08:46.599
<i>Do you need some water?</i>

08:47.801 --> 08:50.269
No, I'm fine.

08:56.909 --> 08:58.643
Bobby, go get your suitcase.

08:58.677 --> 09:01.580
- That's mine.
- What about Gene's?

09:01.614 --> 09:03.482
I'm not going
to pack his suitcase.

09:03.516 --> 09:04.983
I already did it.
You just have to get it.

09:05.017 --> 09:06.551
Go get it, Geenie.

09:06.586 --> 09:08.987
Go up there and get
Pinocchio and bring it down.

09:09.021 --> 09:11.289
I have to do everything.

09:16.027 --> 09:18.895
- Where's Daddy? We're ready to go.
- I'm taking you.

09:18.930 --> 09:21.565
Were you sitting under the hair
dryer and just remembered that?

09:21.600 --> 09:24.034
Where did you get that skirt?

09:24.068 --> 09:25.469
I bought it.

09:25.504 --> 09:27.238
You mean Megan
bought it for you.

09:27.272 --> 09:29.639
- I earned it.
- On what street corner?

09:29.673 --> 09:31.574
She pays me to babysit.

09:31.609 --> 09:34.076
You're not a hired hand,
you're their sister.

09:34.111 --> 09:36.078
Boys, let's go.

09:43.820 --> 09:45.487
I'm sorry to bother you,

09:45.522 --> 09:47.222
but Mr. Cutler
wants to see you.

09:48.891 --> 09:50.925
It's been two and a half hours.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.093
Do you want to rest some more?

09:52.128 --> 09:53.962
No.

09:53.996 --> 09:56.064
May I clean that up?

09:56.098 --> 09:58.299
Please.

09:59.769 --> 10:02.037
Put the Chevy materials
on the coffee table.

10:04.173 --> 10:06.240
The funeral will be tomorrow.

10:06.275 --> 10:08.609
Frank's family has asked
that in lieu of flowers

10:08.644 --> 10:12.412
a donation be made to the
American Cancer Society.

10:14.382 --> 10:17.151
Frank Gleason
was a great artist

10:17.185 --> 10:18.786
and a great friend.

10:20.155 --> 10:22.556
And he made our company whole.

10:24.325 --> 10:26.325
I'm not gonna be able to work
with you through the weekend.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.729
I apologize, but I'm afraid
this takes precedence.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.498
I'll attend the funeral
if that's all right.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.801
But I can still make myself
available for Chevy.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.368
That's helpful.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.171
I'm sorry for your loss.

10:38.205 --> 10:41.007
He's a piece
that cannot be replaced.

10:49.515 --> 10:51.850
The doctor's here
and I want you to see him.

10:51.884 --> 10:54.986
- I don't know.
- No, he's gonna fix you up.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.922
That's an order.

10:56.956 --> 11:00.091
Can I see him, too?
I did it last time.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.026
We're a team.
If he does it, I do it.

11:02.060 --> 11:03.427
Age before beauty.

11:07.232 --> 11:09.100
How old was he?

11:09.134 --> 11:10.801
Older than you,
younger than me.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.237
You either get used to it
or stop thinking about it.

11:14.271 --> 11:16.039
Sorry about your friend.

11:16.073 --> 11:17.841
Yeah, it's tragic.

11:17.875 --> 11:20.110
I hope we don't lose
Ted for too long.

11:20.144 --> 11:22.311
He doesn't know how
to deal with these things.

11:24.148 --> 11:25.615
Do you feel anything?
'Cause I don't.

11:25.649 --> 11:27.283
He said it takes a minute.

11:27.317 --> 11:29.385
- Well, maybe I need another.
- I'm next.

11:29.419 --> 11:33.388
Actually, Roger, I think
Don should go next. Don.

11:38.061 --> 11:40.028
Pleasure to meet you.
Dr. Hecht.

11:40.063 --> 11:41.997
Don Draper.
Where do you want me?

11:42.031 --> 11:44.833
Anything in your medical history
you want to alert me to?

11:44.868 --> 11:47.802
No, I'm just--

11:47.836 --> 11:49.837
hell, I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

11:49.872 --> 11:51.973
You're exhausted.

11:52.007 --> 11:53.741
I'll need you to turn
around and drop your pants.

11:53.776 --> 11:55.709
- This goes in the gluteus.
- What is it?

11:55.744 --> 11:58.012
It's an energy serum.

11:58.046 --> 12:00.314
<i>Oh? What's in it?</i>

12:00.348 --> 12:02.482
It's proprietary.
But all you need to know

12:02.516 --> 12:05.185
is it's a complex
vitamin superdose.

12:05.219 --> 12:08.789
It's basically my own combination
of B vitamins and a mild stimulant.

12:08.823 --> 12:10.323
You have a heart condition?

12:10.357 --> 12:12.659
No. I thought you said it was mild.
What does it do?

12:12.693 --> 12:15.361
Well, a lot of things.
But I think it'll give you

12:15.396 --> 12:16.830
what Jim Cutler says you need.

12:16.864 --> 12:18.998
24 to 72 hours

12:19.032 --> 12:21.834
of uninterrupted creative
focus, energy, and confidence.

12:21.868 --> 12:24.136
- Really?
- Really.

12:24.171 --> 12:25.771
No one told you about this?

12:28.975 --> 12:30.843
I've visited
some agencies lately.

12:30.877 --> 12:34.445
- You've got a great outfit here.
- Thank you.

12:34.479 --> 12:37.081
All anybody wants to know is what
are you gonna call this place?

12:37.116 --> 12:39.784
Can you tug your drawers
down a little?

12:41.954 --> 12:46.557
"SCDPCGC"?
That's a mouthful.

12:58.602 --> 13:01.504
Stan again.

13:02.974 --> 13:05.108
What do you say, Don?
You think you can beat me?

13:05.143 --> 13:08.644
I want another chance.
You changed course.

13:08.678 --> 13:11.180
- Who's next?
- That'd be me.

13:11.215 --> 13:13.549
- And I have a heart condition.
- Don't worry about it.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.591
Come on, let's go.
Best two out of three.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.361
You can beat me any day.
Let me see the doctor first.

13:26.395 --> 13:27.762
<i>We'll do before and after.</i>

13:46.948 --> 13:49.283
Hey, kid.
Where you going?

13:51.486 --> 13:53.487
Come in here.

14:02.162 --> 14:03.963
Sit down.

14:07.467 --> 14:09.668
Breathe deep.

14:14.874 --> 14:17.175
Is that you?

14:19.112 --> 14:21.146
No.

14:21.180 --> 14:24.149
It's a chest cold. I've
seen plenty of consumption.

14:24.183 --> 14:25.417
You don't have it.

14:25.451 --> 14:27.684
Lay down here.

14:31.656 --> 14:34.491
Your mama don't know
how to take care of nobody.

14:34.526 --> 14:36.360
She ain't my mother.

14:46.538 --> 14:48.705
Can I help you?

14:48.740 --> 14:50.607
Do we know each other?

14:50.642 --> 14:52.676
I'd like to think so.

14:54.646 --> 14:56.513
Can I help you?

14:56.548 --> 15:01.150
I meant from somewhere
other than from this moment.

15:01.184 --> 15:03.820
I don't think so.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.308
- Where's Ed?
- He said his heart stopped.

15:33.343 --> 15:34.476
Roger took him to the hospital.

15:34.510 --> 15:36.277
But they were both laughing.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.247
The strategy is about some
kind of love transaction

15:39.281 --> 15:40.814
between a parent and a child

15:40.849 --> 15:43.317
involving the greatest
gift of all, a Chevy.

15:43.352 --> 15:46.587
I was a child and she was a child
in this kingdom by the sea.

15:46.621 --> 15:48.555
Four score and seven years ago,

15:48.590 --> 15:51.391
this country had some
memorable happenings.

15:52.626 --> 15:55.028
What I don't understand is

15:55.062 --> 15:56.763
is it "Dad, I want this car"

15:56.797 --> 15:59.866
or "Son, I bought
you this car"?

15:59.901 --> 16:03.169
Great, that's two. We need 15
more and we can try another.

16:03.204 --> 16:05.171
In what family is it "Son,
I bought you this car"?

16:05.206 --> 16:08.207
- Good night, all.
- That guy's family.

16:08.241 --> 16:10.609
Did you hear about
Frank Gleason?

16:10.643 --> 16:12.744
Yeah, I guess
dreams do come true.

16:12.779 --> 16:14.679
I think that's in poor taste.

16:14.714 --> 16:17.082
Tell him, Peggy. Tell him
what a son of a bitch he was.

16:17.117 --> 16:18.784
I liked him.

16:18.818 --> 16:20.286
Before he was sick?

16:20.320 --> 16:22.554
I hate how dying makes
saints out of people.

16:22.588 --> 16:25.656
Well, he's obviously
in a better place.

16:25.690 --> 16:28.393
<i>Have a good weekend.</i>

16:28.427 --> 16:30.327
"Dad, I need the car.
I've got a date."

16:30.361 --> 16:33.130
"Dad, everybody at school
has a car but me."

16:33.164 --> 16:35.799
"Dad, I can only go
to college if I have a car."

16:35.833 --> 16:38.101
- "Dad, I--"
- "Dad, I could be dying in Vietnam.

16:38.136 --> 16:39.602
Don't you want me
to have a car?"

16:39.637 --> 16:41.471
Damn it, Ginsberg.
I had another 80 of them.

16:41.505 --> 16:43.840
I got nothing interesting to
say 'cause I'm not on drugs?

16:43.874 --> 16:45.874
No, you just flushed
a toilet in my head.

16:45.909 --> 16:48.877
"Son, I got a car
when I was your age."

16:48.912 --> 16:51.113
"Son, they didn't have
cars when I was your age."

16:51.148 --> 16:54.683
"Son, you can fly till you're
high as an elephant's eye."

16:54.717 --> 16:56.052
That's great.

16:56.086 --> 16:57.886
What are you, class secretary?

16:57.921 --> 17:00.022
I want to write stuff down
so it looks like I'm working.

17:00.057 --> 17:01.990
Fine.

17:02.024 --> 17:04.492
The child is the father
of the man.

17:04.526 --> 17:06.227
Spectacular.

17:19.174 --> 17:21.208
<i>Mr. Draper.</i>

17:21.242 --> 17:23.710
<i>Mr. Cosgrove is here</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

17:25.813 --> 17:27.580
Hello, Kenny.
How you feeling?

17:27.615 --> 17:29.649
My foot's like new.

17:29.684 --> 17:31.718
You think you'll have
new work on Monday?

17:31.752 --> 17:33.686
I'll have 15 campaigns
for you by then,

17:33.720 --> 17:35.855
but you have to get me in a room
so I can look them in the eye.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.858
The timbre of my voice
is as important as the content.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.194
I don't know whether
I'll be forceful or submissive,

17:41.228 --> 17:42.962
but I <i>must</i> be there
in the flesh.

17:42.997 --> 17:45.231
You understand that I have
no power whatsoever?

17:45.265 --> 17:47.500
That's not true.
Not if they like you.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.868
Oh, they like me all right.

17:51.004 --> 17:53.338
- I'm their favorite toy.
- That's your job.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.241
It's my job to take them to
dinner at 80 miles an hour.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.910
It's my job to stop
a mile from the restaurant

17:58.944 --> 18:00.879
so they can have
five pounds of crab legs

18:00.913 --> 18:03.248
and three bottles of beer apiece
and then go get prime rib.

18:03.282 --> 18:06.150
It's my job to go hunting so
they can fire off their guns

18:06.184 --> 18:07.751
an inch from my ear and laugh

18:07.785 --> 18:10.687
when I get startled
because <i>it's my job.</i>

18:10.722 --> 18:12.289
Where'd you learn that?

18:12.324 --> 18:16.093
My mother.
No, my first girlfriend.

18:24.601 --> 18:26.769
One doesn't like changing
so often, you know?

18:26.803 --> 18:30.073
- I don't know.
- I'm not myself, you see?

18:30.107 --> 18:31.607
I don't see.

18:31.642 --> 18:33.476
And she comes
to the fork in the road

18:33.511 --> 18:36.513
then she says to the Cheshire
Cat, "Which road do I take?"

18:36.547 --> 18:38.547
I know this.
Where do you want to go?

18:38.581 --> 18:41.483
- I don't know.
- Then it doesn't matter, does it?

18:49.825 --> 18:52.394
- How's it going?
- What's going on?

18:52.429 --> 18:54.929
I know you're all feeling
the darkness here today.

18:54.963 --> 18:57.131
But there's no reason
to give in.

18:57.166 --> 19:00.601
No matter what you've heard, this
process will not take years.

19:00.635 --> 19:03.804
In my heart I know
we cannot be defeated

19:03.838 --> 19:06.474
because there is an answer
that will open the door.

19:07.909 --> 19:10.077
There is a way
around this system.

19:10.111 --> 19:12.312
This is a test of our patience

19:12.346 --> 19:14.347
and commitment.

19:14.382 --> 19:17.850
One great idea
can win someone over.

19:17.885 --> 19:20.353
Dear Lord, you're as
good as they say.

19:21.789 --> 19:23.190
That was very inspiring.

19:23.224 --> 19:25.024
Do you have any idea
what the idea is?

19:25.059 --> 19:28.060
No.

19:28.095 --> 19:29.895
But I'm not gonna stop looking.

19:29.929 --> 19:32.298
I think we should order dinner.

19:32.332 --> 19:34.233
I don't think
I'll ever eat again.

19:34.267 --> 19:36.168
Do what you have to.

19:46.612 --> 19:49.647
You're burning up.

19:49.681 --> 19:51.949
You have to eat something.
Sit up.

19:51.984 --> 19:54.385
I can't, Miss Swenson.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.754
Call me AimÃ©e,
and yes, you can.

20:29.952 --> 20:32.254
I've got it.

20:34.657 --> 20:36.491
I've got it.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.760
How many times do you do it?

20:38.794 --> 20:41.095
I need six throws
for a reading.

20:41.130 --> 20:42.930
What are you doing?

20:42.965 --> 20:44.366
The I Ching.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.534
Have you slept?

20:46.568 --> 20:49.637
Crap, I missed
the funeral, didn't I?

20:49.671 --> 20:52.506
- How was it?
- It was rough.

20:52.541 --> 20:54.175
It was beautiful.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.877
Who are you?

20:56.911 --> 20:59.246
Her name is Wendy.
Wendy, this is Don.

20:59.281 --> 21:02.215
Don. Ask a question.

21:02.216 --> 21:04.468
- I'm supposed to be next.
- Are you done with mine?

21:04.503 --> 21:07.753
You can just think of it.
You don't have to say it out loud.

21:10.224 --> 21:12.358
Perfect.

21:15.376 --> 21:17.413
Peggy, do you remember
when we had soup?

21:17.448 --> 21:18.697
Maybe.

21:18.731 --> 21:20.499
Could you be more specific?

21:20.533 --> 21:22.767
Carnegie Deli has great soup.

21:22.802 --> 21:24.769
No, he's talking
about some account.

21:24.804 --> 21:26.971
He asked me yesterday.
I don't think it exists.

21:27.006 --> 21:29.274
- No, I didn't.
- I don't understand what you're asking.

21:29.309 --> 21:31.510
We had an account at Sterling Cooper.
A soup account.

21:31.544 --> 21:33.344
That must have been
before my time.

21:33.378 --> 21:35.012
Can you go to the
archives and look for it?

21:35.046 --> 21:37.315
I already looked.
Why are you asking her?

21:37.349 --> 21:39.317
- 'Cause you think I'm incompetent?
- I did it!

21:39.351 --> 21:42.086
I've got 666 ideas.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.455
I'm wasting my Saturday
with lunatics.

21:44.489 --> 21:46.790
- It's Saturday?
- Yes, it is.

21:46.825 --> 21:48.693
Why don't you lay down
for a little while?

21:48.727 --> 21:51.328
Because I've got it. I want
you to go to the archives.

21:51.362 --> 21:55.632
Look in 1958 or '59 for soup.

21:56.934 --> 21:58.468
You'll know it when you see it

21:58.502 --> 22:00.470
and it's gonna crack
this thing wide open.

22:03.107 --> 22:04.907
You see the mess you made?

22:19.889 --> 22:22.056
<i>That was fast.</i>

22:23.425 --> 22:25.059
What are you doing in here?

22:25.093 --> 22:28.329
You said you were
going to get some ice

22:28.364 --> 22:31.065
and we were going to have a
drink and watch the sun set.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.167
I have some things to do.

22:34.670 --> 22:36.371
Stop doing that.

22:36.405 --> 22:40.674
You are really
uptight, aren't you?

22:40.708 --> 22:42.709
No, I'm just on a deadline.

22:45.647 --> 22:46.980
Where'd you get that?

22:47.014 --> 22:49.916
It was upstairs
in one of the offices.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.721
You want to get it on?

22:55.756 --> 22:57.189
Wendy, what are you doing here?

22:57.223 --> 22:59.558
I'm here to make you
feel better.

22:59.593 --> 23:03.095
I feel great,
but I'm on a deadline.

23:03.129 --> 23:05.964
"Does someone love me?"

23:05.999 --> 23:07.767
What?

23:07.801 --> 23:09.801
That's what your question was.

23:09.835 --> 23:12.370
Why would you say that?

23:12.405 --> 23:14.572
That's everyone's question.

23:16.776 --> 23:19.277
I want to hear your heart.

23:24.917 --> 23:26.684
Oh.

23:26.718 --> 23:28.786
I think it's broken.

23:28.820 --> 23:30.487
You can hear that?

23:30.522 --> 23:32.189
I can't hear anything.

23:32.223 --> 23:34.792
I think it's broken.

23:38.596 --> 23:40.397
You should go.

23:40.432 --> 23:42.799
I'm in the middle of something.

23:54.978 --> 23:56.646
<i>Can you get that?</i>

23:56.680 --> 23:58.714
<i>If it's Jeff Hunter,</i>
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

23:59.816 --> 24:01.683
- Draper's.
- Sally?

24:01.718 --> 24:04.986
- When are you coming home?
- Is Megan there?

24:05.020 --> 24:07.856
- I want to talk to him.
- It's my dad.

24:11.327 --> 24:13.094
Where are you?

24:13.128 --> 24:14.762
I'm still at work.

24:14.796 --> 24:17.431
I have to leave.
I'm leaving right now.

24:17.466 --> 24:20.701
I'm really sorry.
I'm not finished yet.

24:20.736 --> 24:23.036
It-- I'm really close.

24:23.071 --> 24:24.605
It's just the research
hasn't come in.

24:24.639 --> 24:27.575
Don, I don't care.
What am I supposed to do?

24:27.609 --> 24:30.009
I watched them last night
so you could work and now--

24:30.043 --> 24:31.878
I'll be home in a little bit.

24:31.912 --> 24:34.647
Well, I don't like
you working so hard.

24:34.682 --> 24:35.982
You must be exhausted.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.317
Actually, I've got
a second wind.

24:42.089 --> 24:44.190
When's he coming home?

24:44.224 --> 24:47.158
Sally, how would you like to earn
some boots to go with that skirt?

24:47.193 --> 24:49.862
You're going to leave us
with her <i>again?</i>

24:49.896 --> 24:52.330
I'm really sorry, sweetie,
but you know you'll have fun.

24:52.365 --> 24:54.065
Don't make her feel bad.

24:54.100 --> 24:55.434
Where are you going?

24:55.468 --> 24:57.436
I'm going to see a play.

24:57.470 --> 24:59.671
And Jeff my agent is going to
introduce me to some producers

24:59.706 --> 25:01.072
so that maybe I can
be in their play.

25:01.107 --> 25:02.973
Why do you want to do a play?

25:03.008 --> 25:05.510
You're on TV every day.
Don't they know that?

25:06.745 --> 25:08.279
Shit, you must be hungry.

25:08.313 --> 25:10.247
Sally, would you put
a pot of water on the stove?

25:10.282 --> 25:11.616
I'm gonna make
spaghetti in a minute.

25:11.650 --> 25:13.083
I'm gonna wait for Dad.

25:13.118 --> 25:14.685
We're not hungry.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.954
<i>Okay, but go make Gene</i>
<i>a peanut butter and jelly.</i>

25:17.988 --> 25:20.824
Come on, that thing's
twice the size of a real apple.

25:20.858 --> 25:22.091
Step right up.

25:22.126 --> 25:23.960
How about everybody takes one?

25:23.994 --> 25:25.529
Do a real firing squad.

25:25.563 --> 25:27.431
He's gonna look
just like Saint Sebastian.

25:27.465 --> 25:29.065
Hold on a second.
One at a time.

25:29.099 --> 25:30.600
Everybody'll get a chance.

25:30.635 --> 25:31.868
You're pretentious,
you know that?

25:31.903 --> 25:33.202
I love that.

25:33.237 --> 25:34.269
I'm gonna do it.

25:34.304 --> 25:35.404
Fine, but I'm gonna go first

25:35.439 --> 25:36.705
because you're drunk.

25:36.740 --> 25:38.707
In fact, I believe
I'm the only person

25:38.742 --> 25:40.709
in the Time-Life Building
who's not out of his mind.

25:40.744 --> 25:42.711
But you hate him.

25:42.746 --> 25:44.346
I hate apples more.

25:45.782 --> 25:47.082
Don't hit his eye.

25:47.116 --> 25:48.617
Don't hit anything.

25:52.521 --> 25:54.856
Ah!

25:54.890 --> 25:57.191
- Aw, crap.
- Who's next?

25:57.225 --> 25:58.793
It's fine. It's fine.
I've done that before.

26:00.996 --> 26:03.331
- Doesn't hurt at all.
- Let me see. Let me see.

26:03.365 --> 26:04.732
<i>You've gotta keep</i>
<i>pressure on it.</i>

26:04.767 --> 26:06.433
Honestly, Peggy,
I don't even feel it.

26:06.468 --> 26:08.602
Come on, you've got
to wash this.

26:26.187 --> 26:27.954
<i>âª ...each morning âª</i>

26:27.988 --> 26:29.923
<i>âª You just walk past me âª</i>

26:29.957 --> 26:34.294
<i>âª You don't even know</i>
<i>that I exist âª</i>

26:34.329 --> 26:38.698
<i>âª Going out of my head</i>
<i>over you âª</i>

26:38.732 --> 26:42.635
<i>âª Out of my head over you âª</i>

26:42.669 --> 26:45.604
<i>âª Out of my head</i>
<i>day and night âª</i>

26:45.639 --> 26:49.508
<i>âª Night and day and night,</i>
<i>wrong or right âª</i>

26:49.543 --> 26:54.278
<i>âª I must think of a way âª</i>

26:54.313 --> 26:57.749
<i>âª Into your heart âª</i>

26:57.783 --> 27:00.618
<i>âª Oh, there's no reason why âª</i>

27:00.653 --> 27:02.787
<i>âª My being shy âª</i>

27:02.822 --> 27:05.824
<i>âª Should keep us apart... âª</i>

27:06.925 --> 27:09.326
Hold still.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.762
You got a great bedside manner.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.831
What are you doing?

27:16.768 --> 27:18.435
You're lucky
I don't like beards.

27:18.470 --> 27:22.105
Women say that, but
they don't act like it.

27:22.139 --> 27:23.873
You're like my brother.

27:23.907 --> 27:26.275
You don't have a brother.

27:27.644 --> 27:29.612
I want you to stop.

27:31.181 --> 27:32.815
No, you don't.

27:34.618 --> 27:36.919
I have a boyfriend.

27:53.269 --> 27:54.736
No.

27:54.771 --> 27:58.906
Come on.

27:58.940 --> 28:00.408
I need this.

28:00.442 --> 28:02.276
I know, I know.
You're in pain.

28:04.078 --> 28:06.346
My cousin Robbie
was killed in action.

28:08.016 --> 28:10.183
20 years old.

28:13.186 --> 28:15.622
Had to join the fucking Navy.

28:15.656 --> 28:17.924
That's awful.

28:26.734 --> 28:28.400
What happened?

28:29.836 --> 28:32.671
They don't tell you.

28:32.705 --> 28:34.907
They just tell you
when it happened.

28:34.941 --> 28:38.043
March 4th.
Three months ago.

28:42.081 --> 28:45.683
That means my aunt sent
16 letters that he never saw.

28:47.920 --> 28:51.055
You know they get mail
right up to the front lines?

28:52.658 --> 28:55.560
That'd be a bad job, right?

28:55.594 --> 28:57.795
Delivering mail into combat?

28:59.431 --> 29:02.732
I'm so, so sorry to hear that.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.781
I've had loss in my life.

29:20.484 --> 29:23.619
You have to let
yourself feel it.

29:23.653 --> 29:27.055
You can't dampen it
with drugs and sex.

29:28.959 --> 29:30.593
It won't get you through.

29:30.627 --> 29:33.027
Maybe we're different.

29:35.865 --> 29:37.699
Why don't you go home?

29:37.733 --> 29:40.902
'Cause I can't
stand up right now.

29:41.971 --> 29:43.972
That's from the shot.

29:46.174 --> 29:48.008
You've got a great ass.

29:50.645 --> 29:52.546
Thank you.

30:15.836 --> 30:17.937
- Hello?
- Oh!

30:17.971 --> 30:19.739
You startled me.

30:19.773 --> 30:22.107
I didn't know anybody was home.

30:22.142 --> 30:23.509
What are you doing?

30:23.543 --> 30:25.244
Go back to sleep.

30:25.278 --> 30:27.012
What are you doing here?

30:27.047 --> 30:30.149
I'm visiting.
Didn't nobody tell you?

30:30.183 --> 30:32.984
No.
Who are you?

30:33.019 --> 30:35.454
I'm your grandma.

30:35.488 --> 30:37.321
That's impossible.

30:37.356 --> 30:39.390
Now, why is that impossible?

30:40.625 --> 30:43.294
Okay, I know.

30:43.328 --> 30:45.463
But I raised your daddy.

30:46.698 --> 30:48.232
What are you doing here?

30:48.267 --> 30:51.235
I was just looking
for a serving plate.

30:51.270 --> 30:53.437
I was gonna make
your daddy's favorite.

30:53.471 --> 30:55.038
You know, he loves
fried chicken.

30:55.073 --> 30:56.973
I bet you do, too.

30:57.007 --> 30:59.476
Ooh, you sure look like him.

30:59.510 --> 31:01.344
No one said you were coming.

31:01.379 --> 31:04.381
Well, I think I was supposed
to be a surprise for you.

31:04.415 --> 31:06.916
And your daddy
said I could visit

31:06.951 --> 31:08.551
and he gave me a key.

31:08.585 --> 31:10.953
I thought nobody was home.

31:12.122 --> 31:13.889
Come over here and give a hug

31:13.923 --> 31:15.558
to your Grandma Ida.

31:18.495 --> 31:21.530
Now don't you be rude to me.

31:21.565 --> 31:24.433
Is that how you was raised
to speak to your betters?

31:26.469 --> 31:27.970
No.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.439
I'm gonna fix you some eggs.

31:31.474 --> 31:34.209
And you're gonna sit down
and you're gonna eat 'em.

31:34.243 --> 31:38.046
But first, you're gonna tell
me who else in the house.

31:38.081 --> 31:40.181
How come you don't know?

31:40.216 --> 31:43.117
I haven't talked to your daddy
in a long time.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.519
And he want
to surprise me, too.

31:45.553 --> 31:47.321
I've never heard of you.

31:47.355 --> 31:51.592
Your daddy Mr. Donald
Draper or not?

31:54.630 --> 31:57.563
You come over here
and give me some sugar.

32:08.475 --> 32:10.810
Now I know you ain't
here all by yourself.

32:10.845 --> 32:13.178
My little brothers are here.

32:13.212 --> 32:15.580
Well, there's no need
to wake them.

32:15.615 --> 32:17.215
Just be us.

32:17.250 --> 32:19.817
Okay, let's go
and make you some eggs.

32:19.852 --> 32:22.053
I bet you like them scrambled.

32:22.087 --> 32:23.554
I can make them.

32:23.588 --> 32:25.957
And burn yourself on the stove?

32:27.626 --> 32:29.160
When you think
they're gonna be home?

32:29.194 --> 32:30.628
I don't know.

32:32.564 --> 32:35.066
When's the last time
you saw my dad?

32:35.100 --> 32:37.367
Years ago.

32:37.401 --> 32:39.836
I doubt he's changed.
He still handsome?

32:39.871 --> 32:41.437
Yes.

32:41.472 --> 32:43.173
Your mama still
a piece of work?

32:43.207 --> 32:44.908
Yes.

32:44.942 --> 32:47.377
Now what do they call you?

32:47.411 --> 32:49.379
Sally.

33:04.722 --> 33:07.941
_

33:16.831 --> 33:20.400
<i>âª Stars fading,</i>
<i>but I linger on, dear âª</i>

33:20.435 --> 33:24.570
<i>âª Still craving your kiss âª</i>

33:24.605 --> 33:26.272
<i>âª I'm longing</i>
<i>to linger... âª</i>

33:26.306 --> 33:29.041
- Your fever broke.
- Ahem.

33:29.075 --> 33:32.278
- Yes, Miss Swenson.
- Call me Amy.

33:32.312 --> 33:35.314
It's not really AimÃ©e. I just
liked the way it was spelled.

33:35.349 --> 33:37.617
It's got two Es and an accent.

33:37.651 --> 33:39.552
It's a nice name.

33:39.586 --> 33:41.453
You <i>are</i> better.

33:41.487 --> 33:45.690
<i>âª But in your dreams,</i>
<i>whatever they be... âª</i>

33:45.725 --> 33:47.058
Do you like this?

33:47.092 --> 33:48.693
I do.

33:53.633 --> 33:55.567
Do you like girls?

34:00.872 --> 34:03.840
You don't even know what
to do right now, do you?

34:06.411 --> 34:07.544
But you like it.

34:07.579 --> 34:08.978
Stop it.

34:14.818 --> 34:16.786
You like my bosom.

34:16.820 --> 34:18.388
I don't know.

34:20.291 --> 34:22.925
Don't you want to know
what all the fuss is about?

34:22.958 --> 34:24.427
No.

34:25.896 --> 34:29.531
It's okay.
I'll do everything.

34:29.565 --> 34:33.068
<i>âª But in your dreams,</i>
<i>whatever they be âª</i>

34:33.103 --> 34:39.341
<i>âª Dream a little dream</i>
<i>of me. âª</i>

34:44.822 --> 34:47.650
_

34:53.289 --> 34:54.688
What are you looking for?

34:54.723 --> 34:56.891
Now you stop asking questions

34:56.926 --> 34:59.828
or I'm not gonna let you eat
in your nice living room.

34:59.862 --> 35:01.494
Maybe I know where it is.

35:01.529 --> 35:03.864
I'm just looking for some place

35:03.898 --> 35:07.000
to hide my presents
I bought y'all.

35:08.136 --> 35:10.737
My, that TV's in here good!

35:10.771 --> 35:12.306
Who's she?

35:12.340 --> 35:14.374
Is that little Bobby?

35:14.408 --> 35:16.909
My, you have grown up big!

35:16.944 --> 35:19.445
- Who are you?
- That's Grandma Ida.

35:19.479 --> 35:21.047
We don't have a grandma.

35:21.081 --> 35:22.882
You do now.

35:22.916 --> 35:25.684
And you're gonna get
all the candy and toys

35:25.719 --> 35:27.820
and good stuff
your grandma bought you

35:27.855 --> 35:29.322
when you wake up
in the morning.

35:29.356 --> 35:32.091
But right now,
you go back to sleep.

35:32.125 --> 35:33.758
I'm not tired.

35:33.792 --> 35:36.127
Now, Sally don't remember,

35:36.162 --> 35:39.064
but I gave your daddy a watch,

35:39.098 --> 35:41.166
gold watch.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.934
And I got a new band for it

35:42.969 --> 35:45.370
and I wanna fix it up
before he come back.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.105
You seen it?

35:47.139 --> 35:48.873
He has four watches.

35:48.907 --> 35:51.275
I'll know it when I see it.

35:51.309 --> 35:52.877
They're in the drawer
by his bed.

36:00.218 --> 36:01.818
Are we allowed to watch TV?

36:01.853 --> 36:03.487
I think she's lying.

36:03.521 --> 36:05.355
Are we Negroes?

36:05.389 --> 36:06.990
Will you put me through
to the police?

36:07.024 --> 36:08.892
It's an emergency.

36:08.926 --> 36:10.960
I'm at 783 Park Avenue

36:10.995 --> 36:13.496
and there's a stranger
in our apartment.

36:13.530 --> 36:14.998
What?

36:15.032 --> 36:16.966
No, I'm 14.

36:17.001 --> 36:19.035
My name is Sally Draper.

36:19.069 --> 36:20.469
Hello?

36:21.570 --> 36:23.338
Yes, sir.

36:23.373 --> 36:25.340
These children
ought to be in bed

36:25.375 --> 36:27.209
and they ain't
too well behaved.

36:29.678 --> 36:32.981
Yes, sir. They played
a joke on both of us.

36:34.050 --> 36:36.285
Uh-huh.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.252
Good night.

36:40.255 --> 36:43.090
Now why'd you do
something like that?

36:46.461 --> 36:49.297
You hurt my feelings.

36:49.331 --> 36:51.966
I'm gonna go out
and get some air.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.102
When I come back,
you best be sleeping.

37:33.105 --> 37:34.605
"This may be hard to believe,

37:34.639 --> 37:36.407
but the history
can't be ignored.

37:36.442 --> 37:39.310
The history should <i>not</i>
be ignored.

37:39.345 --> 37:41.979
Look, I don't want to waste
your time, with..."

37:43.647 --> 37:45.449
Peggy!

37:52.423 --> 37:54.591
"I don't want you
to shut this door.

37:55.926 --> 37:57.693
Just let me say a few things.

37:57.727 --> 37:59.061
You and I both know--"

37:59.096 --> 38:00.262
Did you want us?

38:00.297 --> 38:02.031
Yes.
Get everyone.

38:02.065 --> 38:03.899
No, wait.

38:03.933 --> 38:05.401
Just listen.
I've got it.

38:05.435 --> 38:07.503
Great.

38:12.842 --> 38:14.476
Remember this work?

38:14.510 --> 38:16.211
I've never seen it before.

38:16.245 --> 38:19.047
Well, it says it all.
It really does.

38:19.081 --> 38:23.317
Okay, I've got
this great message

38:23.351 --> 38:26.453
and it has to do with what
holds people together.

38:26.488 --> 38:28.522
What is that thing
that draws them?

38:28.556 --> 38:30.590
It's a history.

38:30.625 --> 38:33.527
And it may not even be
with that person, but it's...

38:34.729 --> 38:37.163
it's like a...

38:37.197 --> 38:38.698
well, it's bigger than that.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.767
And that makes them buy a car?

38:40.801 --> 38:44.604
If this strategy is successful,
it's way bigger than a car.

38:44.639 --> 38:47.507
It's everything.

38:47.542 --> 38:50.777
I keep thinking about the basic
principle of advertising.

38:50.811 --> 38:52.445
There's entertainment
and you stick the ad

38:52.479 --> 38:54.379
in the middle of the entertainment
like a little respite.

38:54.414 --> 38:55.848
It's a bargain.

38:55.882 --> 38:57.349
They're getting
the entertainment for free.

38:57.383 --> 38:58.851
All they have to do
is listen to the message.

38:58.885 --> 39:01.520
But what if they don't
take the bargain at all?

39:01.555 --> 39:03.388
What if they're suddenly
bored of the entertainment?

39:03.423 --> 39:05.457
What if they don't--
what if they turn off the TV?

39:05.491 --> 39:07.726
- You gotta get your foot in the door.
- Exactly!

39:07.761 --> 39:10.361
So, how do I do that?

39:10.395 --> 39:11.896
Let's say I get her
face to face.

39:11.931 --> 39:13.798
How do I capture
her imagination?

39:13.832 --> 39:15.800
I have a sentence, maybe two.

39:15.834 --> 39:17.735
Who's "her"?

39:17.770 --> 39:21.138
Promise them everything. You know,
you're gonna change their life.

39:21.173 --> 39:23.374
- <i>You're gonna take away their pain.</i>
- That's good.

39:23.408 --> 39:25.175
Then you hit 'em
with the one-two punch.

39:25.209 --> 39:27.010
What's the answer
to all of life's problems?

39:27.045 --> 39:28.078
A Chevy.

39:28.112 --> 39:29.980
No, it's not.

39:30.014 --> 39:31.481
Then it's oatmeal?

39:31.515 --> 39:33.483
No.

39:33.517 --> 39:36.653
What have you been doing
the last three days?

39:36.688 --> 39:39.122
Have you been working
on Chevy at all?

39:39.156 --> 39:40.991
I gotta go.

39:41.025 --> 39:43.493
You wanna get someone
in here who can draw?

39:43.527 --> 39:45.128
No, I don't have time for art.

39:51.368 --> 39:53.269
He's happy.
Now we can relax.

39:54.871 --> 39:57.039
You think he'll care
if I nap in here?

39:57.074 --> 39:59.141
Don? Wait.

40:24.899 --> 40:26.700
I'm going home!

40:32.713 --> 40:34.380
Okay, I'm gonna
change my shirt,

40:34.414 --> 40:36.515
tell Megan I'm going out
for cigarettes,

40:36.550 --> 40:39.351
then I'm gonna knock
on her door.

40:39.386 --> 40:41.854
Sylvia, don't close
the door on me.

40:44.224 --> 40:46.592
"When in the course
of human events--" no.

40:46.626 --> 40:49.628
"You haven't heard
everything I have to say."

40:49.662 --> 40:51.630
Don't shut the door on me.

40:53.933 --> 40:56.367
All right, all right,
he's home.

40:56.402 --> 40:58.436
Oh, thank God you're here.

40:59.739 --> 41:01.506
What's going on?

41:01.540 --> 41:03.273
I'll tell you what's going on.

41:03.308 --> 41:05.643
Some elderly Negro woman
held your children hostage

41:05.677 --> 41:06.877
and robbed you blind.

41:06.912 --> 41:09.379
- What?
- Betty.

41:09.414 --> 41:11.048
She robbed a bunch
of places in the building

41:11.083 --> 41:12.149
and she came in here.

41:12.183 --> 41:13.584
Our back door was open.

41:14.987 --> 41:16.954
She said she was your mother.

41:18.489 --> 41:20.323
We think we caught her
boarding the IRT.

41:20.357 --> 41:22.291
You'll need to come down
in the next 24 hours

41:22.326 --> 41:23.392
and ID your things.

41:23.427 --> 41:25.328
Because no one was here.

41:25.362 --> 41:27.831
Because she's off on the
casting couch and you're--

41:27.865 --> 41:29.766
what does he tell everybody,
that he's at work?

41:29.800 --> 41:32.568
This is not the time or the
place for this conversation.

41:32.603 --> 41:34.569
Ma'am, this could have
happened to anyone.

41:34.604 --> 41:36.639
Anyone who lives
in this disgusting city

41:36.673 --> 41:38.473
and leaves their
three children alone.

41:38.508 --> 41:40.709
Do you know Henry's
running for office?

41:42.211 --> 41:43.912
Sally, I'm really sorry.

41:43.947 --> 41:44.980
I should have been
home earlier.

41:45.015 --> 41:46.815
I want to go home.

41:50.786 --> 41:53.521
You get your hands off me!
I don't need to be manhandled!

41:53.555 --> 41:55.089
<i>I know you've
been holding out on me.</i>

41:55.124 --> 41:57.091
You don't know anything.
I defy your accusations.

41:57.126 --> 41:58.993
You peddle that ass
on the street.

41:59.028 --> 42:01.029
<i>You don't deserve a home.</i>
<i>You don't deserve me.</i>

42:01.063 --> 42:03.131
Yeah? I do fine
without you.

42:03.165 --> 42:04.866
- And you owe me money, not the
other way around. - Get out.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.166
'Cause I took
that boy's cherry.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.035
<i>$5, we'll call it even.</i>

42:10.304 --> 42:11.437
Is that true?

42:11.472 --> 42:13.473
No.

42:13.507 --> 42:15.308
You filthy, shameful,

42:15.342 --> 42:19.179
disgusting, shameful,
horrible...

42:19.213 --> 42:20.947
You're trash!

42:20.982 --> 42:22.614
You are filth!

42:22.649 --> 42:24.150
You know that you are!

42:24.184 --> 42:26.786
After I gave you a home,

42:26.820 --> 42:29.722
you go and do something
this disgraceful!

42:52.712 --> 42:56.246
I know you're exhausted, but I could
feel the floor swimming, too,

42:56.280 --> 42:57.981
when I came home to that.

42:58.016 --> 43:00.350
I'm surprised
we didn't all faint.

43:04.455 --> 43:07.257
I'm really sorry.

43:07.291 --> 43:11.094
Sally seems so grown up,
but she's really still a kid.

43:43.491 --> 43:45.860
- How are you?
- Busy.

44:25.630 --> 44:27.265
You should talk to him.

44:31.503 --> 44:33.171
Hello?

44:33.205 --> 44:35.439
I just wanted to call
and tell you I'm okay.

44:35.473 --> 44:37.407
I didn't have a heart attack.

44:37.441 --> 44:39.009
I've just been working
too much.

44:43.114 --> 44:44.647
I'm-- I'm so embarrassed.

44:44.682 --> 44:46.883
I acted like
a stupid little kid.

44:46.918 --> 44:48.919
No, you didn't.

44:48.953 --> 44:51.087
And I'm sure she's fooled
plenty of adults, too.

44:51.122 --> 44:53.023
She said she knew you.

44:53.057 --> 44:54.657
I asked her everything I know

44:54.692 --> 44:57.927
and she had an answer
for everything.

44:57.961 --> 45:00.830
Then I realized I don't know
anything about you.

45:03.300 --> 45:06.469
<i>Mr. Chaough wants to see you.</i>

45:08.905 --> 45:11.306
You did everything right.

45:11.341 --> 45:12.808
Try and forget about it.

45:12.842 --> 45:14.509
Okay.

45:14.544 --> 45:16.578
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Sally.

45:19.148 --> 45:21.350
I left the door open.

45:21.384 --> 45:23.284
It was my fault.

45:26.054 --> 45:28.656
Okay. Bye.

45:38.066 --> 45:40.167
I need to talk to you.

45:40.201 --> 45:42.168
Morning, fellas.

45:43.771 --> 45:45.972
I'm fine.
Thank you for asking.

45:46.006 --> 45:47.874
How could you bring
Frank's little girl here?

45:47.908 --> 45:49.709
I let her tag along.

45:49.744 --> 45:51.043
I kept an eye on her,
didn't I, Don?

45:51.078 --> 45:52.311
Who?

45:52.346 --> 45:54.213
Wendy.

45:54.248 --> 45:56.148
Believe me, it's a lot better
than what could have happened

45:56.183 --> 45:58.149
if I had let her loose in the
Village like she wanted.

45:58.184 --> 46:00.352
Well, that's not
what her mother thinks.

46:00.387 --> 46:02.053
What the hell went on
here this weekend?

46:02.088 --> 46:03.555
Half of this work is gibberish.

46:03.590 --> 46:05.190
"Chevy" is spelled wrong.

46:05.224 --> 46:07.259
Look, I am going
to continue on Chevy

46:07.293 --> 46:09.094
in my function
as creative director.

46:09.128 --> 46:11.263
That is, evaluating
other people's work.

46:11.297 --> 46:13.098
That's all I can do right now.

46:14.366 --> 46:15.867
Call me around 1970

46:15.901 --> 46:17.668
when they're ready
to make an ad.

46:17.703 --> 46:20.237
What are you talking about?
I can't do this by myself.

46:20.272 --> 46:21.539
I'm sorry, Ted.

46:21.573 --> 46:22.740
But every time we get a car,

46:22.775 --> 46:24.409
this place turns
into a whorehouse.
