36:56.540 --> 36:58.007
"Your own darknet"?

36:58.080 --> 36:59.274
I already did.

37:00.850 --> 37:01.839
Come here.

37:03.720 --> 37:04.744
Come here.

37:05.690 --> 37:06.679
So...

37:07.750 --> 37:09.889
This is us,
on the network...

37:09.960 --> 37:11.951
I'm the only person
on the network right now,

37:12.030 --> 37:16.194
but I created software that
you can download or copy
on to any other device.

37:16.260 --> 37:17.727
It's just like Tor.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.495
It gives you access
to the darknet.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.663
But, it's my darknet.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.968
I call it ArakNet.

37:25.670 --> 37:27.638
So, you know,
what a network is,

37:27.710 --> 37:30.508
is it's just a bunch Of
computers talking to each other
at the same time.

37:30.580 --> 37:32.309
That's basically
what the Internet is.

37:32.380 --> 37:35.349
It could be two computers.
I_t_could be two
million computers.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.980
All _that matters is that
it has a platform.

37:38.050 --> 37:40.109
I created that platform.

37:40.190 --> 37:41.919
ArakNet.
ArakNet.

37:41.990 --> 37:45.153
Even if the NSA
had our software...
(RON CLEARING THROAT)

37:45.230 --> 37:48.358
...they couldn't identify
your IP address
or your identity.

37:55.640 --> 37:56.629
Damn.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.200
So, I can just
use this right now?

38:01.270 --> 38:04.398
Well, you can use it
right now, I'm the only
person in the network.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.641
You gotta get more
people on the network.

38:06.710 --> 38:07.745
Oh, shit.
