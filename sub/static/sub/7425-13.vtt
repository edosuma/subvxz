WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:03.356
They did the same thing to me.

00:03.357 --> 00:05.669
Five years ago.
Or was it six?

00:05.891 --> 00:07.664
Who the hell are you?

00:07.665 --> 00:08.514
I'm you.

00:08.539 --> 00:10.897
Couldn't mix the right serum the way
they wanted, so they caged me.

00:10.898 --> 00:12.198
What do you know about
this Barnes guy?

00:12.267 --> 00:13.500
He wants to make...
A beast?

00:13.568 --> 00:14.601
SAM:
<i>That's why they want</i>

00:14.669 --> 00:15.669
<i>to make the serum; they want</i>

00:15.737 --> 00:17.203
<i>to combine it with beast blood.</i>

00:17.272 --> 00:19.773
<i>They want to make</i>
<i>a better mousetrap.</i>

00:19.840 --> 00:21.875
Vincent! They have Tori.

00:21.942 --> 00:22.942
She came to rescue me.

00:23.010 --> 00:24.344
Tori.

00:24.412 --> 00:26.146
Vincent?
I should've protected you.

00:26.213 --> 00:29.015
I should have known.
No, you belong with Catherine.

00:30.785 --> 00:32.946
Apparently the I.D. on that
kidnapper is Frank Darnell.

00:32.953 --> 00:34.453
TESS:
This guy was just a front man

00:34.521 --> 00:36.222
for whoever
Tony Barnes really is.

00:36.290 --> 00:37.657
Where's the guy in the cell?
Dana.

00:37.724 --> 00:39.025
Oh, my God, Sam,

00:39.093 --> 00:41.994

NYPD. Put your hands up.

01:23.936 --> 01:25.503
Turn around.

01:29.642 --> 01:31.843
Gabe! What are
you doing here?

01:31.910 --> 01:33.444
I'm bringing you coffee.
Yeah, well, I could have shot you.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.880
Well, I didn't think
that part through.

01:35.948 --> 01:37.748
It's just, last night
on the phone,

01:37.816 --> 01:39.717
you said you might
come by on your way in,

01:39.784 --> 01:41.518
and we've both
been so busy...

01:41.586 --> 01:42.907
You wanted to spend
time together.

01:42.921 --> 01:44.521
Thought I'd get
creative about it.

01:48.493 --> 01:50.093
You know...

01:50.161 --> 01:52.363
I actually have
investigating to do here.

01:52.430 --> 01:55.298
Right. Got to find
that Tony Barnes guy.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.300
CATHERINE: You hadn't left
the precinct,

01:57.369 --> 02:00.070
I could actually follow up on these leads
on normal people hours.

02:00.137 --> 02:02.806
Well, you know I only left
because we thought we had him.

02:02.874 --> 02:06.042
I know, but now I have a boss
who can't know about the investigation

02:06.110 --> 02:08.377
and who insists
on a hard start, 8:00 a.m.

02:08.445 --> 02:10.613
Well, does this hard start
apply to Saturdays?

02:10.681 --> 02:12.582
'Cause I was thinking
it might be nice for us

02:12.649 --> 02:14.584
to go on a real date--
you know, <i>above</i> ground.

02:14.651 --> 02:17.053
Yeah, without beast
scratches on the walls.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:27.130 --> 02:28.831
You okay?

02:28.899 --> 02:31.000
Uh, yeah, yeah,

02:31.067 --> 02:32.107
I'm fine.
Saturday's great.

02:32.168 --> 02:34.003
I'm all yours.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.170
Clearly you're excited.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.639
(laughs)

02:36.707 --> 02:38.573
(drips echoing)

02:38.641 --> 02:40.842
Okay, doesn't it sound
like my Americano's

02:40.911 --> 02:42.177
dripping into a cave?

02:43.746 --> 02:45.480
CATHERINE:
<i>Are you sure?</i>

02:45.548 --> 02:47.283
'Cause it was
right under your cell.

02:47.350 --> 02:49.919
What do you mean, there's
a storage space under there?

02:49.986 --> 02:51.420
Or a tunnel or something.

02:51.487 --> 02:52.788
Sam, I know we've been
over everything already

02:52.855 --> 02:54.423
and you just want
to get back to normalcy,

02:54.490 --> 02:55.791
but this is a new finding, so...

02:55.858 --> 02:58.026
Yeah, it's probably
just a sewer line

02:58.093 --> 02:59.327
or something.

02:59.395 --> 03:00.796
What about the guy
that was down there

03:00.863 --> 03:02.764
posing as Barnes?
Frank Darnell? We don't

03:02.832 --> 03:04.599
have any more information on him.
But he was using

03:04.667 --> 03:06.034
Barnes's name and his property--
I mean, there has

03:06.101 --> 03:07.201
to be a link to him somewhere.

03:07.269 --> 03:09.203
His name has just
been nagging

03:09.271 --> 03:10.939
at me-- I swear
I've heard it before.

03:11.006 --> 03:12.873
You've heard
the name Frank before?

03:12.942 --> 03:14.342
Keep teasing, and I
might not marry you.

03:14.410 --> 03:16.177
We're renewing our vows
this weekend.

03:16.245 --> 03:17.378
Yeah, we found
this beautiful inn

03:17.446 --> 03:18.879
in upstate New York.
His idea.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.214
Ah, that is so sweet.

03:20.282 --> 03:21.849
Well, she didn't
replace me, so she

03:21.917 --> 03:23.851
deserves a second wedding.
And it also happens

03:23.919 --> 03:26.220
to be our anniversary on Saturday.
CATHERINE: Sorry, guys.

03:26.288 --> 03:28.155
New boss, so I've got to go.

03:28.222 --> 03:30.390
But I will not stop
until I find this guy.

03:30.459 --> 03:32.636
You know, Catherine, you
should come to the vow renewal.

03:32.637 --> 03:35.139
Sam, it's Valentine's Day--
she probably has plans.

03:36.698 --> 03:38.499
Saturday's Valentine's?

03:38.567 --> 03:40.468
Mm-hmm.
Oh, so you do have plans.

03:40.535 --> 03:44.171
Y-You know, I don't think he realized.
Oh, no,

03:44.238 --> 03:45.638
if it's Gabe,
he realized.

03:45.706 --> 03:47.374
Gabe is the ADA that
was working on our case.

03:47.442 --> 03:49.409
He's got a thing for her.
So you two now...?

03:49.477 --> 03:51.511
We're just seeing
where things take us.

03:51.579 --> 03:52.846
And now I am

03:52.913 --> 03:55.415
really, really late.
Um, thank you.

03:55.483 --> 03:57.584
Bottom line, you're late.

03:57.651 --> 04:00.019
And that's what I'm all about--
bottom line.

04:00.087 --> 04:01.721
Yeah, we are, too.
Yeah, we are, too.

04:01.789 --> 04:03.155
It's like our motto. Yeah, absolutely.
Good.

04:03.223 --> 04:04.223
Then you won't be surprised

04:04.291 --> 04:05.859
by this grid I've drawn up.

04:05.926 --> 04:08.895
Now, here's every team
in the precinct with the number

04:08.963 --> 04:10.930
of cases they've closed
over the last six months.

04:10.998 --> 04:13.065
And speaking of
bottom line,

04:13.133 --> 04:14.333
notice where <i>your</i> names fall.

04:16.269 --> 04:18.837
We should be above Willansky,
'cause that says we got 14.

04:18.904 --> 04:20.539
Yeah. That's
a smudge.

04:20.607 --> 04:22.541
You've got a four.

04:22.609 --> 04:24.410
Captain Ward,
we may be below

04:24.478 --> 04:25.577
everyone else,
but we've been working

04:25.645 --> 04:26.712
on these FBI...
I heard.

04:26.779 --> 04:28.114
Some fancy FBI case.

04:28.181 --> 04:30.016
FBI doesn't
pay your salary.

04:30.083 --> 04:31.183
NYPD does.

04:31.251 --> 04:33.051
Right. Bottom line.

04:33.119 --> 04:34.720
Now...
(clears throat)

04:34.787 --> 04:36.722
I don't know what your
deal with Lowan was--

04:36.789 --> 04:38.957
maybe he was afraid
to criticize the chick team,

04:39.025 --> 04:40.291
'cause it's not "PC,"

04:40.359 --> 04:42.528
but you two are
the weak link here.

04:42.595 --> 04:43.762
So this is your warning.

04:43.830 --> 04:45.597
Get your number
of closed cases up,

04:45.665 --> 04:46.765
or you're both out.

04:46.833 --> 04:48.233
TESS:
<i>I cannot be fired.</i>

04:48.300 --> 04:50.235
I'll be disowned
by my entire family.

04:50.302 --> 04:51.636
Who are you calling?
Vincent.

04:51.703 --> 04:53.264
No... Did you not just
hear that tirade?

04:53.305 --> 04:55.025
Yes, I did hear.
That's why I'm calling him.

04:55.041 --> 04:57.442
Vincent can work on the Barnes
case while I'm here with you

04:57.510 --> 04:59.210
trying to solve
NYPD cases.

04:59.278 --> 05:01.146
He's not picking up.
You know,

05:01.213 --> 05:03.048
he's probably in mourning;
his girlfriend just died.

05:03.115 --> 05:04.249
Because of Barnes.

05:04.316 --> 05:05.550
Tess, Vincent will
help when he

05:05.617 --> 05:07.484
finds out we
didn't catch the guy.

05:07.553 --> 05:09.286
Maybe he needs
to be distracted.

05:09.354 --> 05:11.923
Yeah, but you won't be
distracted by him, right?

05:11.990 --> 05:13.624
By Vincent?

05:13.692 --> 05:15.726
Tess, no. I'm with Gabe.

05:15.794 --> 05:16.961
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
"With Gabe"?

05:17.029 --> 05:18.328
You haven't even
had sex yet.

05:18.396 --> 05:19.396
We haven't had time.

05:19.464 --> 05:21.899
Time? To have sex? Please.

05:21.967 --> 05:24.000
Okay, this morning,
I had a flash of him.

05:24.069 --> 05:26.770
Naked?
As a beast.

05:26.837 --> 05:27.922
Oh.

05:27.947 --> 05:29.339
Look, maybe it was
just the setting, you know?

05:29.340 --> 05:30.740
We were in a dungeon.

05:30.808 --> 05:31.942
But Valentine's
will be different.

05:32.009 --> 05:32.909
We'll be in a restaurant...

05:32.977 --> 05:34.578
Wow. That's great.

05:34.645 --> 05:36.447
You realize I've had
zero action since Thanksgiving?

05:36.514 --> 05:39.616
Wait. Who were you with
on Thanksgiving?

05:39.684 --> 05:41.985
Uh... no one. Nothing.

05:42.053 --> 05:44.187
Doesn't even count.

05:44.254 --> 05:45.855
We could see a movie.

05:45.923 --> 05:47.443
There's that new 3D...
JT, I appreciate

05:47.491 --> 05:49.793
what you're doing,
but I'm fine, okay?

05:49.860 --> 05:53.630
Fine? You haven't moved
from this couch in days.

05:53.698 --> 05:55.864
We got to shake you
out of this guilt wallow.

05:55.932 --> 05:58.667
You are not responsible
for Tori's death.

05:58.735 --> 06:01.504
Aw, come on, man,
it's not just that.

06:03.107 --> 06:06.275
So what is it?
You're buying flowers?

06:06.343 --> 06:08.223
I almost died last week,
so I'm seizing the day,

06:08.245 --> 06:10.679
and you're deflecting.
What else do you feel guilty about?

06:10.747 --> 06:12.214
For whom?

06:12.281 --> 06:14.717
The flowers? Tess.

06:14.784 --> 06:17.185
Tess? Really?

06:17.253 --> 06:21.023
From "Your Secret
Admirer." Whoa.

06:21.091 --> 06:22.858
Way to seize, buddy,
way to seize.

06:22.926 --> 06:24.392
Vincent,
talk to me.

06:24.460 --> 06:26.461
Studies show it helps,
and I have a PhD.

06:26.529 --> 06:29.864
12 units of psych under my belt.
Whatever it is,

06:29.932 --> 06:32.567
I've known you forever.
Nothing could shock me.

06:32.635 --> 06:35.703
Okay, you want to know what
Tori's last words to me were?

06:36.705 --> 06:39.174
"You belong with Catherine."

06:39.242 --> 06:41.543
That's what she said

06:41.611 --> 06:42.977
as she lay dying?

06:43.045 --> 06:44.979
"You belong with Catherine"?

06:45.047 --> 06:46.648
Tori's words, not mine.

06:46.715 --> 06:48.650
Okay, and the only reason
I'm thinking of them

06:48.717 --> 06:52.520
is because they remind me of all
the misery that I have caused.

06:52.587 --> 06:55.823
Or are you thinking about
them because they resonate?

06:55.891 --> 06:59.827
We shouldn't see a 3D movie,
we should see <i>Les Mis.</i>

06:59.895 --> 07:01.895
I'm serious.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.898
Tori was just like Éponine,
who died for the man she loves,

07:04.966 --> 07:07.568
knowing he was gonna go off
and be with somebody else.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.070
Well, I'm not gonna go off
and be with Catherine.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.098
Because you feel guilty
about Tori? You shouldn't.

07:12.106 --> 07:13.407
Éponine died in peace,

07:13.475 --> 07:15.342
knowing Marius
was gonna be happy.

07:15.410 --> 07:16.943
And she has
the best solos

07:17.011 --> 07:19.379
in the whole show.
No, because Catherine

07:19.446 --> 07:20.881
is my friend.

07:20.948 --> 07:22.916
And she is with Gabe,
which is a good thing,

07:22.984 --> 07:24.851
because when I'm with her,
bad things happen,

07:24.919 --> 07:26.920
which is why
I'm gonna stay far away,

07:26.988 --> 07:29.089
right there on that couch.

07:33.127 --> 07:34.927
(footsteps approaching)
What,

07:34.995 --> 07:36.929
your "friend" is here?

07:36.997 --> 07:38.198
Vincent?
By the way,

07:38.265 --> 07:40.099
she's with Tess.

07:40.167 --> 07:42.068
Hey, I tried calling,
but I think

07:42.135 --> 07:43.936
your ringer's off.
She wants your help

07:44.004 --> 07:44.937
finding Tony Barnes.

07:45.005 --> 07:47.139
W... Wasn't he...

07:47.208 --> 07:48.474
The guy in
the dungeon?

07:48.542 --> 07:50.276
That was Frank Darnell
posing as him.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.711
I would've told
you earlier,

07:51.778 --> 07:53.139
but I knew you'd
be dealing with...

07:53.146 --> 07:55.480
JT: He has, but he's good now.
JT.

07:55.548 --> 07:57.883
Good. I think I found a space
under the dungeon.

07:57.951 --> 07:59.284
It could have some more
clues. I was hoping

07:59.352 --> 08:00.586
you could check it out.

08:00.653 --> 08:01.954
And you two will be...?

08:02.022 --> 08:03.756
TESS: Doing
our day jobs

08:03.824 --> 08:06.291
for a change.
We'd be out of your way.

08:07.793 --> 08:09.428
Okay.
Okay.

08:09.495 --> 08:10.429
Great. Thank you.

08:10.496 --> 08:12.598
(phone ringing)

08:12.665 --> 08:13.832
It's Dana.
She wanted

08:13.899 --> 08:15.767
some information. Hi.

08:16.902 --> 08:18.303
What?

08:18.371 --> 08:19.638
Sam was just attacked

08:19.706 --> 08:21.607
in their apartment.
Okay. Yeah.

08:21.674 --> 08:23.842
We'll be right there.
I'm gonna bring Vincent with me.

08:23.909 --> 08:27.345
Great. So much
for being on my own.

08:28.748 --> 08:30.514
SAM (groans):
There were two men,

08:30.582 --> 08:32.751
and they wore masks,
and they said that I

08:32.818 --> 08:34.852
really screwed up
by talking to the police.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.687
They probably work
for Barnes.

08:36.756 --> 08:38.256
Well, everything seems fine.
You're lucky.

08:38.323 --> 08:40.524
It's a good thing I
came home when I did.

08:40.592 --> 08:42.960
I'm gonna look for prints.
Sounds like they might come back.

08:43.027 --> 08:44.928
We got to get full security on this place.
Yeah,

08:44.996 --> 08:46.029
and for our vows this weekend.

08:46.097 --> 08:47.030
You want full
security

08:47.098 --> 08:48.031
at the Harrison Inn?

08:48.099 --> 08:49.133
How romantic.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.400
Well, what if it's these guys?

08:50.435 --> 08:52.370
It'll be very
meaningful, too.

08:52.437 --> 08:54.077
I mean, you rescued me,
and you brought us

08:54.105 --> 08:55.339
back together.
She has

08:55.407 --> 08:56.641
Valentine's plans.

08:56.708 --> 08:59.143
Wait, this is
on Valentine's Day?

08:59.210 --> 09:01.945
SAM: You can bring
the ADA. Invite JT.

09:02.013 --> 09:04.148
All you guys.
Well, uh, actually,

09:04.215 --> 09:07.151
I'm not an official.
Yeah, but you could sense any threat.

09:07.218 --> 09:08.952
We'd feel very safe.

09:09.020 --> 09:10.954
Catherine, you said you
didn't have any leads.

09:11.022 --> 09:12.956
If something were to happen...

09:13.024 --> 09:14.824
That could bring us
closer to Barnes.

09:14.892 --> 09:16.559
TESS: Uh,
what's happening?

09:16.627 --> 09:18.995
We're all going
to upstate New York

09:19.062 --> 09:20.897
for Valentine's Day.

09:22.659 --> 09:26.659

09:33.598 --> 09:34.898
(line ringing)

09:34.966 --> 09:35.933
GABE:
Hello?

09:36.001 --> 09:37.467
Hey. Where are you?

09:37.535 --> 09:38.636
I am at home.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.237
Great. Could you buzz me up?

09:40.304 --> 09:41.238
I'm here.

09:41.305 --> 09:42.740
Uh, actually, I am

09:42.807 --> 09:45.875
on my way home. Why?
Uh, wh-what's going on?

09:45.943 --> 09:48.578
Oh, I wanted to see you.

09:48.646 --> 09:51.214
And, um, I know that
we have plans this weekend,

09:51.282 --> 09:53.116
but Sam Landon was just
assaulted in his apartment,

09:53.184 --> 09:54.717
and we think it was Tony Barnes.

09:54.785 --> 09:56.886
So you're cancelling?
No.

09:56.954 --> 09:59.656
But he and Dana, they want
to renew their vows, and they

09:59.723 --> 10:02.291
want us there as security.
(laughs)

10:02.359 --> 10:03.793
Still sounds like
you're canceling.

10:03.861 --> 10:05.928
No. I-I can bring date.

10:05.996 --> 10:08.131
And it's in upstate New York.

10:08.198 --> 10:09.999
It could be fun.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.168
Uh... uh, yeah,

10:12.235 --> 10:13.469
you know, that's fine.
But, um,

10:13.537 --> 10:15.237
I got to go.
The D.A.'s office

10:15.305 --> 10:17.106
is calling.
Okay, wait, that reminds me.

10:17.174 --> 10:19.175
Since I can't go
through standard procedure,

10:19.242 --> 10:21.610
could you get a warrant for me?
I want to look

10:21.678 --> 10:22.918
at the surveillance
from Dana's apartment.

10:22.919 --> 10:25.019
Yeah.
Um...

10:25.815 --> 10:29.117
Or if that's too much to ask...

10:29.186 --> 10:30.519
Uh, no. It just
may take a while.

10:30.587 --> 10:31.953
But, listen, I'm gonna have

10:32.021 --> 10:33.355
to call you back, okay?

10:34.657 --> 10:36.992
Okay.

10:39.328 --> 10:41.797
(siren blaring)

10:43.666 --> 10:45.967
Vincent?
Yeah.

10:46.035 --> 10:47.936
Hey, I was just about
to head out, so...

10:48.004 --> 10:49.504
So, there's nothing
down thee?

10:49.572 --> 10:52.273
Uh, no, no. I was gonna take off
to Dana's place,

10:52.341 --> 10:54.542
try and track down
Sam's attackers.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.530
You're mad because I roped
you into this weekend.

10:56.579 --> 10:58.713
Come on, I'm not mad.
No, I just think

10:58.780 --> 11:00.181
that it could potentially
be good for the case.

11:00.249 --> 11:01.816
Us all going away together?

11:01.883 --> 11:03.551
Yes. I just... I think
Sam blocked things

11:03.619 --> 11:05.486
to try and cope, and this
weekend, he'll be relaxed,

11:05.554 --> 11:07.487
he might remember something.
You know what? I'm sorry.

11:07.555 --> 11:08.488
I don't know how I can
help with all that.

11:08.556 --> 11:09.489
No, because he wants you there.

11:09.557 --> 11:10.858
That'll help him to relax.

11:10.926 --> 11:12.193
(scoffs)
Okay, look,

11:12.260 --> 11:13.794
we're both here right now.

11:13.862 --> 11:15.423
Can we at least figure out
how to access

11:15.430 --> 11:16.897
whatever's underneath here?

11:16.965 --> 11:19.800
I spilled my coffee around here,
and there was an echo.

11:19.868 --> 11:22.703
Will you come
to the vow renewal?

11:22.771 --> 11:25.839
Uh, what about
your boyfriend?

11:27.642 --> 11:29.843
Here?
Yeah.

11:29.910 --> 11:32.346
I mean, it's Valentine's
Day and all, so...

11:32.413 --> 11:34.648
Well, you and I are friends,
and we're both

11:34.716 --> 11:36.350
invested in this case, you know.

11:36.417 --> 11:37.584
I think he'll accept that.

11:37.652 --> 11:38.852
(heart beating loudly)

11:38.919 --> 11:42.155
Okay, fine, I will go.

11:42.223 --> 11:44.390
Thank you.

11:44.458 --> 11:48.027
Okay, why is your
heart still racing?

11:48.095 --> 11:50.263
'Cause I'm trying to
hear this damn echo,

11:50.330 --> 11:51.697
and all I can hear is...

11:51.766 --> 11:53.566
Okay, it's Gabe.

11:53.634 --> 11:55.534
I still have this
nagging feeling about him.

11:55.602 --> 11:59.071
You know, just now, when I
told him about the weekend,

11:59.139 --> 12:01.540
he just... he seemed annoyed,
and then he was reluctant

12:01.608 --> 12:03.242
to get a warrant
for Dana's apartment, and...

12:03.310 --> 12:04.744
Catherine, maybe he's busy,
right?

12:04.811 --> 12:06.245
He just started a new job.

12:06.313 --> 12:08.514
Yeah, but he also lied.

12:08.582 --> 12:09.915
He said he was home, and he wasn't.
I don't know.

12:09.983 --> 12:11.350
Maybe he's off buying you

12:11.418 --> 12:13.118
a Valentine's Day
gift or something.

12:13.186 --> 12:14.586
You're right. You're right.
I'm probably just nervous,

12:14.654 --> 12:15.854
starting a relationship, which

12:15.922 --> 12:17.455
actually makes sense,

12:17.523 --> 12:20.025
considering how badly
the last one ended, no offense.

12:20.093 --> 12:22.694
None taken.

12:25.932 --> 12:27.299
(yells)

12:27.366 --> 12:28.867
(grunts)

12:28.935 --> 12:31.369
Oh.

12:31.437 --> 12:33.438
Think I found
how they got down there.

12:33.506 --> 12:34.639
(stone scraping)

12:34.707 --> 12:37.074
(water dripping)

12:39.645 --> 12:41.145
Come on.

12:44.650 --> 12:46.951
A furnace?

12:49.387 --> 12:52.389
(creaking)

12:52.457 --> 12:55.126
What do you think they
were burning in there?

12:55.194 --> 12:57.561
Bones.

13:07.539 --> 13:09.840
They're human.

13:09.907 --> 13:11.308
Although the cells
are corrupted.

13:11.376 --> 13:12.976
CATHERINE:
Which means

13:13.044 --> 13:14.945
Barnes had Frank
Darnell experimenting

13:15.012 --> 13:17.448
on whoever this is, and
then had them incinerated?

13:17.515 --> 13:19.582
Actually, the DNA points that
there's more than one victim.

13:19.650 --> 13:21.784
TESS:
So, the good news is

13:21.853 --> 13:23.519
I saved our jobs.

13:23.587 --> 13:25.322
And the bad news?
Okay.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.024
Uh, what happened is that
some idiot sent me the most

13:28.092 --> 13:31.661
hideous, over-the-top bouquet
I have ever seen, which Ward

13:31.729 --> 13:33.090
somehow interpreted
as another sign

13:33.097 --> 13:34.865
that you and I are
not doing our jobs.

13:34.932 --> 13:37.367
That's ridiculous.
No. What is

13:37.434 --> 13:39.802
ridiculous are the balloons
coming out of this thing.

13:39.870 --> 13:41.303
I like balloons.

13:41.372 --> 13:42.839
CATHERINE:
Okay, Tess, the bad news?

13:42.906 --> 13:44.507
TESS: Okay, so to convince
him that, you know,

13:44.575 --> 13:46.442
we're not using the
precinct like our very own

13:46.510 --> 13:49.445
Mustang Ranch, I had to tell him
that we have a case,

13:49.513 --> 13:51.947
so Sam Landon's attack is now
official. Please don't be mad.

13:52.015 --> 13:54.816
Actually, that might
not be a bad thing.

13:54.885 --> 13:57.819
Uh, did you not hear
the part about corrupted cells?

13:57.888 --> 14:00.789
NYPD gets onto this,
they could get onto beasts.

14:00.857 --> 14:02.724
We're not gonna tell them
that part, but now that this is

14:02.792 --> 14:04.960
official, we can actually drag
Sam into an interrogation room,

14:05.028 --> 14:06.728
pressure him into talking.

14:06.796 --> 14:08.236
What happened
to keeping him relaxed?

14:08.265 --> 14:10.832
We found bone chips.
Darnell has been

14:10.900 --> 14:12.868
burning bodies
underneath Sam's cell.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.804
Someone burns toast two floors
below me, I can smell it.

14:15.872 --> 14:18.907
And when I asked him about it,
he denied knowing anything,

14:18.974 --> 14:21.877
said it was a sewer line.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.646
SAM: <i>I can't believe</i>
<i>you brought me in here.</i>

14:24.714 --> 14:26.480
They just threatened to kill me
for talking to you.

14:26.548 --> 14:28.416
We know, you're terrified.

14:28.483 --> 14:30.385
That's why we think you're
not telling us everything.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.752
I have.

14:31.820 --> 14:33.521
No, you haven't.

14:33.588 --> 14:35.756
Sam, you know
what I am, okay?

14:35.824 --> 14:37.758
Obviously, I've done things
that I feel guilty about.

14:37.826 --> 14:39.394
Doesn't help to keep it in.

14:39.461 --> 14:41.329
You can tell us.
We'll protect you.

14:44.733 --> 14:46.700
He said he'd kill me--

14:46.768 --> 14:48.702
Frank, whoever he was--

14:48.770 --> 14:50.938
if I didn't help
with his experiments.

14:51.005 --> 14:52.706
And when they didn't work,

14:52.774 --> 14:54.374
he'd take them down to the...

14:54.443 --> 14:55.843
Who?

14:55.911 --> 14:58.912
I didn't know any
of their names,

14:58.980 --> 15:02.882
um, except one. Uh, Clara.

15:02.951 --> 15:04.784
(sighs)

15:04.852 --> 15:06.286
I didn't want to die.

15:06.354 --> 15:08.521
I-I just wanted
to see Dana again.

15:08.589 --> 15:10.390
Did you see anyone else
with Frank?

15:10.458 --> 15:12.525
Someone who might have been
working with Barnes?

15:12.593 --> 15:14.227
Or maybe <i>is</i> Barnes?

15:14.295 --> 15:15.962
Uh, there was one man

15:16.029 --> 15:17.564
who'd come down periodically.

15:17.631 --> 15:18.932
Can you describe him?

15:18.999 --> 15:20.299
Um, tall,

15:20.367 --> 15:22.034
dark hair, uh,

15:22.102 --> 15:23.703
couldn't see much down there.

15:23.771 --> 15:26.238
I-I just thought
he was one of Barnes's men.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.108
What?

15:33.213 --> 15:34.813
SAM:
That's him.

15:34.881 --> 15:36.615
Captain Ward?

15:36.683 --> 15:38.717
SAM:
No, the man in the photo.

15:38.785 --> 15:42.288
That's the guy.

15:42.356 --> 15:45.591
Sam, that's the ADA.
Oh.

15:45.658 --> 15:49.495
Oh, God, oh, that's...
that's your Valentine, right?

15:49.562 --> 15:50.829
I'm telling you,
it was really dark down there.

15:50.897 --> 15:52.263
I'm sure I'm wrong.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.123
That didn't mean anything,
right?

15:58.190 --> 15:59.724
Maybe he thought
Gabe was familiar

15:59.757 --> 16:01.092
'cause he's
seen him on TV.

16:01.972 --> 16:03.907
I would know. Ever
since I was on TV,

16:03.974 --> 16:05.308
people recognize
me all the time.

16:05.376 --> 16:06.910
All the time?
Yeah.

16:06.977 --> 16:08.778
All right, he mentioned
a Clara, right?

16:08.845 --> 16:11.414
CATHERINE:
Right, let's focus on that.

16:11.481 --> 16:13.449
Besides, you haven't sensed
anything suspicious, right?

16:13.517 --> 16:16.585
About Gabe? No, not
since last year, okay?

16:16.653 --> 16:19.422
And compared to me,
the guy is a choir boy.

16:19.489 --> 16:20.923
Okay, so three Claras
have gone missing

16:20.990 --> 16:22.758
in the tri-state area
in the last six years.

16:22.826 --> 16:25.694
Clara Freudenstein, 87.

16:25.762 --> 16:28.798
87? I don't think
Barnes is trying to make

16:28.865 --> 16:30.766
an octogenarian beast.

16:33.536 --> 16:37.105
No, but if someone was a beast
in the past,

16:37.173 --> 16:39.474
they'd know how
to evade your ability

16:39.542 --> 16:41.209
to detect.
Okay.

16:41.277 --> 16:43.178
Are we still
talking about Gabe?

16:43.246 --> 16:44.712
Yeah, he has a history.

16:44.780 --> 16:46.815
I mean, that lab
in the dungeon

16:46.882 --> 16:48.883
was just like the one that
he had in his mansion last year.

16:48.951 --> 16:51.653
Which he doesn't need anymore,
because he's no longer a beast.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.455
Right. Right,
but it's just...

16:53.522 --> 16:55.457
it's like being
in a relationship

16:55.524 --> 16:57.058
with someone
who's cheated on you.

16:57.125 --> 16:59.461
Every time they're late,
you can't help but wonder.

16:59.528 --> 17:01.963
Catherine, there is no
need to wonder, okay?

17:02.030 --> 17:05.566
Okay?
Okay.

17:05.633 --> 17:08.301
CATHERINE:
What about Clara Bledsoe, 32?

17:08.369 --> 17:10.003
She was last seen
about a year ago

17:10.071 --> 17:12.806
in the Short Hills Mall
parking lot.

17:12.874 --> 17:15.242
CATHERINE:
Okay, that's weird.

17:15.310 --> 17:16.742
What?

17:16.810 --> 17:18.179
CATHERINE:
<i>So,</i>

17:18.246 --> 17:19.579
Clara Bledsoe and Gabe were

17:19.646 --> 17:21.048
at the same orphanage
at the same time.

17:21.116 --> 17:22.883
Which might not
mean anything.

17:22.951 --> 17:24.852
Yeah, but they might have
known each other,

17:24.919 --> 17:26.587
and that might just be
a coincidence,

17:26.654 --> 17:28.320
but Sam did point out
his picture.

17:28.388 --> 17:29.990
And don't most perps

17:30.057 --> 17:32.025
and victims know each other?

17:32.093 --> 17:34.728
What? I watch a lot of <i>CSI.</i>
Okay, I'm not

17:34.796 --> 17:36.316
saying that Gabe is a perp.
Okay, look,

17:36.330 --> 17:38.264
we don't even know
if Clara is a victim.

17:38.332 --> 17:40.533
We haven't even got the results
from the bones yet.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.402
Right, but the whole reason
we brought Sam into the precinct

17:42.470 --> 17:44.437
was to get him
to give us a lead, and he did.

17:44.505 --> 17:47.207
Gabe. And I think that we
should at least look into it.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.775
TESS: So, checking phone records,
financials.

17:49.843 --> 17:51.777
This is a terrible way
to start a relationship.

17:52.980 --> 17:54.347
I'll get right on it.

17:54.415 --> 17:57.783
You know what?
Can I talk to you for a sec?

17:59.686 --> 18:01.787
(sighs)
Look, as your friend,

18:01.855 --> 18:04.189
we can be completely honest
with each other, right?

18:04.257 --> 18:05.791
I don't think that
he's guilty...

18:05.859 --> 18:07.459
Okay, I think you're just trying
to make an excuse.

18:07.528 --> 18:09.128
You're starting
something with him,

18:09.195 --> 18:11.230
it's freaking you out,
and you're pushing him away.

18:11.297 --> 18:12.864
That's what you think
this is about?

18:12.932 --> 18:14.799
Me projecting
some relationship issue?

18:14.867 --> 18:16.068
VINCENT:
I'm just saying,

18:16.136 --> 18:17.636
he is a good guy.

18:17.703 --> 18:19.405
Why do you keep defending him?

18:19.472 --> 18:21.373
Are you afraid of
seeming jealous?

18:21.441 --> 18:23.808
Because I get it. You are
over our relationship, and

18:23.876 --> 18:26.245
you don't have to prove that
to me by being pro-Gabe.

18:26.312 --> 18:27.946
I am not proving anything.

18:28.014 --> 18:29.581
You said

18:29.649 --> 18:32.483
that your former relationship
screwed you up a little.

18:32.552 --> 18:36.220
Maybe you're buying
into all this, okay, because--

18:36.288 --> 18:38.456
I don't know--
yes, I did betray you a lot,

18:38.524 --> 18:40.959
and if I didn't, then maybe
you would be able to...

18:41.027 --> 18:43.828
What, trust Gabe?

18:43.896 --> 18:46.330
If you were
truly my friend,

18:46.398 --> 18:48.099
you wouldn't ignore
anything suspicious

18:48.167 --> 18:49.567
about the person I was dating.

18:49.634 --> 18:52.770
You would be concerned enough
to look into it.

18:52.837 --> 18:55.906
JT: Got a big airline charge
to Mexico. Could be

18:55.974 --> 18:58.014
fleeing the country.
Okay, I'm gonna go talk to him.

18:59.644 --> 19:01.244
Okay, wait. Uh,

19:01.312 --> 19:03.146
just talk to him
at your place, okay?

19:03.214 --> 19:06.650
I will search his loft,
see if I can find anything.

19:06.718 --> 19:08.485
Thank you.

19:15.827 --> 19:17.594
GABE: <i>I'm really sorry</i>
<i>I had to kick you</i>

19:17.661 --> 19:18.861
off the phone earlier.

19:18.929 --> 19:20.663
I was in the middle
of something.

19:20.731 --> 19:22.466
Sam I.D.'d you.

19:22.533 --> 19:24.534
How do you mean?

19:24.602 --> 19:28.371
Well, he recognized you,
which is weird, but what's even

19:28.439 --> 19:31.040
weirder is that he mentioned the
name of one of Barnes's victims.

19:31.109 --> 19:32.642
She happened
to be at the

19:32.710 --> 19:34.877
same orphanage as you
at the same time.

19:34.945 --> 19:36.713
Clara Bledsoe?

19:36.780 --> 19:39.782
I don't remember her,
but you want me to see

19:39.850 --> 19:42.184
if I can find something out
about her?

19:42.252 --> 19:43.720
That's what I wish you'd said

19:43.787 --> 19:45.154
when I'd asked
for help on that warrant.

19:45.222 --> 19:46.656
Cat, I told you,
I was in the middle...

19:46.724 --> 19:48.224
You were in the middle
of something, I know.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.159
And I... I don't know

19:50.227 --> 19:51.893
if it's just
that you're irritated

19:51.961 --> 19:54.696
about this weekend, or if
something bigger is going on.

19:54.764 --> 19:56.298
Something bigger?

19:56.366 --> 19:58.000
Where is all this coming from?

19:58.067 --> 20:01.036
Gabe, you've been acting
really weird lately.

20:01.104 --> 20:04.140
The only reason
I've been acting weird is...

20:04.207 --> 20:08.744
I planned a trip to Mexico
for Valentine's Day.

20:08.811 --> 20:11.513
(laughs)

20:11.580 --> 20:13.915
Mexico?

20:13.983 --> 20:15.550
Mexico, you and me?

20:15.618 --> 20:17.218
No, me and my doorman.
(laughs)

20:17.286 --> 20:18.754
Yeah, me and you.

20:18.821 --> 20:20.155
We haven't had
any time together,

20:20.222 --> 20:21.823
and I thought
I'd whisk you away.

20:21.891 --> 20:23.724
That's why
I sounded weird on the phone.

20:23.792 --> 20:25.260
I was in the middle
of renewing my passport.

20:25.327 --> 20:28.763
Gabe, I've never been to Mexico.

20:28.830 --> 20:30.931
(distant siren blaring)

20:32.268 --> 20:34.602
(door creaks open)

20:36.405 --> 20:38.072
(beep)

20:38.140 --> 20:40.374
I'm inside.

20:40.441 --> 20:42.209
Okay, Tess just left.

20:42.277 --> 20:44.045
You don't think she knows I sent
the hideous flowers, do you?

20:44.112 --> 20:45.512
No.

20:45.580 --> 20:47.247
She probably was just
in a bad head space.

20:47.315 --> 20:49.050
You know, between you and me,

20:49.117 --> 20:50.685
she's a little worried
that she's gonna get fired

20:50.752 --> 20:53.187
'cause she hasn't closed
any cases yet.

20:53.254 --> 20:55.389
Right. She mentioned that.

20:55.956 --> 20:57.791
Forget flowers.

20:57.858 --> 20:59.625
I know what
I'm getting her next.

20:59.694 --> 21:02.062
See? Good things do happen
around you.

21:02.129 --> 21:03.863
JT, wait.

21:10.304 --> 21:13.939
You know that serum that
Barnes's people had you mix?

21:14.007 --> 21:17.643
Did Catherine or anyone find it?

21:17.711 --> 21:20.246
No, they didn't. Why?

21:20.314 --> 21:21.780
(beep)

21:27.452 --> 21:29.905
All this time, you had us
believe that you had changed.

21:29.906 --> 21:30.670
Get your hands off of me.

21:30.671 --> 21:32.190
It's okay. He just... he was
just planning a trip to Mexico.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.785
Explain this.
What is that?

21:33.786 --> 21:35.286
You have been talking to
him about me?

21:35.355 --> 21:37.055
It's the serum that JT
was forced to make.

21:37.122 --> 21:39.023
So what was it doing
in your apartment?

21:39.091 --> 21:40.191
What were you doing
in my apartment?

21:40.259 --> 21:42.026
Answer the question.
I have no idea

21:42.094 --> 21:44.295
what it was doing there.
For all I know, you planted it.

21:44.330 --> 21:46.697
(gasping)

21:49.335 --> 21:51.569
Gabe,
Vincent would never do that.

21:54.173 --> 21:57.141
Wait, is that
why you called me over here?

21:57.209 --> 21:59.077
To distract me,
so your ex could go

21:59.144 --> 22:01.545
search through my...
No, I-I wanted to talk to you.

22:01.613 --> 22:03.981
But you knew he was going there?
It's just that Sam,

22:04.048 --> 22:05.616
he thought he saw you
in the dungeon and then,

22:05.684 --> 22:07.444
with the orphanage connection...
So, a little

22:07.451 --> 22:09.253
circumstantial evidence,
and you jumped to me

22:09.320 --> 22:11.388
being involved in all this?
I am sorry, but y...

22:11.455 --> 22:13.723
your history isn't
exactly spotless.

22:13.791 --> 22:14.758
What?

22:14.825 --> 22:15.926
Gabe, she's a detective, okay?

22:15.994 --> 22:16.927
She has to follow...

22:16.995 --> 22:17.995
Can you stay out of this?

22:18.029 --> 22:19.629
Sorry.
What I meant

22:19.697 --> 22:21.731
was that you have done things
in the past,

22:21.799 --> 22:24.333
you have done experiments...
What I have done

22:24.402 --> 22:28.170
is everything I can think of
to show you that I have changed.

22:28.238 --> 22:30.239
The whole reason
I stayed at the precinct

22:30.307 --> 22:32.742
was to protect
the two of you.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.677
I spent half the day
researching Frank Darnell

22:34.745 --> 22:36.513
because I knew you didn't have
any leads on your case,

22:36.580 --> 22:38.615
and you still think I'm capable
of doing something like this?

22:38.682 --> 22:40.182
I don't want to.

22:40.250 --> 22:43.519
It's not that long ago you tried
to kill Vincent

22:43.586 --> 22:45.454
and you locked me up.

22:45.522 --> 22:47.589
It's kind of hard
to forget that.

22:59.268 --> 23:01.637
You know I'm telling
the truth when I say

23:01.704 --> 23:04.105
I've never seen that
vial before in my life.

23:05.207 --> 23:07.208
Yes.

23:07.276 --> 23:09.210
Then tell her that,
'cause I'm tired

23:09.278 --> 23:11.212
of trying to get
her to trust me.

23:17.253 --> 23:19.487
(sighs)

23:21.438 --> 23:23.403
Hey, it's Detective Vargas.
I'm checking on the results

23:23.404 --> 23:25.567
from the Sam Landon case.
Yeah, I'll hold.

23:25.568 --> 23:26.769
(clears throat)
Vargas.

23:26.837 --> 23:28.604
Oh, hey.

23:28.671 --> 23:30.672
I'm just closing in,
getting us to five.

23:30.740 --> 23:33.108
You mean... six.

23:33.175 --> 23:36.478
Wow, you girls
really aren't good at math.

23:36.546 --> 23:38.113
But nice job.

23:38.180 --> 23:39.948
The dean from the university's
biochem department

23:40.015 --> 23:41.149
just called personally.

23:41.217 --> 23:42.917
Biochem?
Mm-hmm.

23:42.985 --> 23:45.254
Mentioned you by name,
said you were fast, efficient.

23:45.321 --> 23:48.422
Apparently that stolen particle
analyzer or whatever it was

23:48.490 --> 23:49.657
was worth a couple mil.

23:55.665 --> 23:57.906
(sighs) That was bad. That was really bad.
Okay. Come on.

23:58.024 --> 23:59.759
It could've been worse,
all right? He could've been involved.

23:59.826 --> 24:02.462
At least we would've been
somewhere on the case. Kidding.

24:02.529 --> 24:04.964
All right, so this thing was
in his apartment,

24:05.031 --> 24:07.099
so obviously
someone has set him up.

24:07.167 --> 24:09.301
It was probably Barnes,
but why would he frame Gabe?

24:09.369 --> 24:11.449
Well, he's the perfect person,
right, given his past?

24:11.504 --> 24:12.838
Which Barnes
probably knows about.

24:12.906 --> 24:14.840
He's obviously well-educated

24:14.908 --> 24:17.109
on the subject
of cross-species DNA.

24:17.177 --> 24:20.111
Look, I'm supposed to be running
with this, so why don't you

24:20.179 --> 24:21.780
go talk to Gabe.
And say what?

24:21.847 --> 24:23.615
You heard him.
I don't know. Explain to him again.

24:23.683 --> 24:25.524
You know, especially
while I'm not right there.

24:27.420 --> 24:28.987
Catherine, he'll get over it.

24:29.054 --> 24:31.290
I don't know if I will.

24:31.357 --> 24:34.293
I keep saying that I haven't
had time to be with him

24:34.360 --> 24:35.727
because of this case,

24:35.795 --> 24:39.164
but I think I have been using it
as an excuse.

24:39.231 --> 24:41.565
I've been hiding
in my work and...

24:41.633 --> 24:43.334
maybe even in our friendship.

24:44.436 --> 24:46.537
And, yes,

24:46.605 --> 24:49.040
yes, you called it.
I got to go.

24:49.108 --> 24:50.171
Vincent.

24:50.196 --> 24:52.110
No, I never should've broken
into his apartment.

24:52.111 --> 24:55.479
I know that you're in this mode
of taking everything on,

24:55.547 --> 24:56.980
that everything's your fault,
but it isn't.

24:57.048 --> 24:59.750
I'm gonna go and figure
this case out, okay?

25:01.152 --> 25:04.221
(phone rings)

25:04.289 --> 25:05.656
Hey.

25:05.724 --> 25:08.025
Hey. Prints came back
from Dana's apartment.

25:08.092 --> 25:11.428
One of Sam's attackers was
Michael Donaldson, ex-Navy Seal.

25:11.495 --> 25:13.596
I had I.T. access his e-mails.

25:13.664 --> 25:16.099
Well, at least one of us
has been productive.

25:16.167 --> 25:18.535
This guy Donaldson got an e-mail
from some guy calling himself

25:18.602 --> 25:20.871
"Blind Chemist"
right before Sam's attack,

25:20.939 --> 25:22.873
and it says, "Just scare him."

25:22.941 --> 25:25.775
Well, he did that. You think
Blind Chemist is Barnes?

25:25.843 --> 25:27.803
Well, if it is, he just got
another one that said,

25:27.845 --> 25:29.379
"Put him in the ground."

25:32.616 --> 25:35.184
SAM: <i>We're not cancelling</i>
<i>this weekend. We have you</i>

25:35.252 --> 25:37.019
as security, we'll have Vincent.
Sam.

25:37.087 --> 25:38.921
We spent all day
working on our vows.

25:38.989 --> 25:40.423
It's what Adam would've wanted.
Let's leave

25:40.491 --> 25:42.124
Adam out of this.
First of all, he was

25:42.192 --> 25:43.559
nine years old. Second of all,

25:43.626 --> 25:45.194
he would've been
grossed out by vows.

25:45.262 --> 25:46.562
Adam?

25:46.629 --> 25:48.097
Our son.
Died of leukemia.

25:48.165 --> 25:49.798
That's why Sam
got so involved

25:49.867 --> 25:51.533
in genetics research.
Until I found

25:51.601 --> 25:53.402
a clinical trial
that killed him.

25:53.470 --> 25:54.904
Catherine's gonna need
an antidepressant

25:54.972 --> 25:56.138
when she leaves here.

25:56.206 --> 25:58.074
No, it's okay. I am so sorry.

25:58.141 --> 25:59.975
Our vows are
all about him

26:00.042 --> 26:03.211
and what we went through
as a couple with... after.

26:03.279 --> 26:05.146
But they're gonna
be uplifting

26:05.214 --> 26:07.115
and under five minutes.
Seven,

26:07.183 --> 26:09.485
but, yes, uplifting.

26:09.552 --> 26:11.720
You're right.

26:11.788 --> 26:13.555
You're not cancelling.
(chuckles)

26:13.623 --> 26:15.323
VINCENT:
<i>I need prints,</i>

26:15.391 --> 26:17.893
particles, anything to try
and prove that he's been set up,

26:17.960 --> 26:20.328
okay? I have to fix this.
No, you don't.

26:20.396 --> 26:21.676
Vincent, this wasn't your fault.

26:21.730 --> 26:23.664
We all thought he was the guy.
Yeah,

26:23.732 --> 26:24.766
and I should've known better.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.935
And yet it was my idea to search

26:27.003 --> 26:28.569
his loft.
(sighs)

26:28.637 --> 26:30.071
I sabotaged this.

26:30.139 --> 26:32.507
You know, I think I wanted him
to be the guy.

26:32.574 --> 26:35.175
Not consciously, but when Catherine
told me that she didn't know

26:35.243 --> 26:38.446
if she could move forward
with Gabe, I was so happy.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.848
Which is so messed up because
I'm probably the reason

26:40.916 --> 26:42.750
why she can't move forward
in the first place.

26:42.818 --> 26:46.587
Oh, my God, you do still have
feelings for her.

26:46.655 --> 26:47.789
(sighs)
Yes.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.656
Okay, yes. Fine, I do.

26:49.724 --> 26:52.526
(chuckles)
Where are we with these bones?

26:52.593 --> 26:55.129
Assays are still running.
But this is your window.

26:55.196 --> 26:58.098
They're broken up.
Yeah, because of me.

26:58.166 --> 27:00.167
No, no, no, no, no.
You just said

27:00.235 --> 27:02.202
she can't move
forward with him.

27:02.270 --> 27:04.138
That can't be
because you busted in on them.

27:04.205 --> 27:07.040
There's something inherently
broken in their relationship.

27:07.107 --> 27:08.442
No, I am broken.

27:08.509 --> 27:10.276
I've made it
completely impossible

27:10.344 --> 27:11.978
for her to trust anyone.

27:12.046 --> 27:13.112
Or she can't be with him
because...

27:13.180 --> 27:14.981
she's still in love with you.

27:15.049 --> 27:16.950
And now you've realized
you're still in love with her,

27:17.017 --> 27:19.453
so what are you waiting
for? It's V. Day.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.987
Start wooing!

27:21.055 --> 27:22.855
(beeping)

27:22.923 --> 27:24.790
Although I guess solving
her case would be

27:24.858 --> 27:26.025
a great way to start.

27:29.196 --> 27:31.464
(knocking)
Hey, it's Catherine.

27:31.531 --> 27:35.234
I brought Mexico.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.476
I didn't know
what your go-to was, so...

27:43.543 --> 27:46.979
I brought everything:
burritos, enchiladas...

27:47.046 --> 27:48.046
I already ate.

27:48.114 --> 27:50.148
Gabe, I'm sorry.

27:50.216 --> 27:52.184
Most of this was just
my baggage,

27:52.251 --> 27:53.986
and I'm checking it at the door.

27:54.053 --> 27:55.387
Are you really checking it
or are you just saying that

27:55.455 --> 27:57.255
'cause you got caught?
No, I am...

27:57.323 --> 28:00.092
checking it. I am letting it go.

28:00.159 --> 28:03.695
(sighs) Look, I just got back
from Sam and Dana's.

28:03.762 --> 28:05.830
They've been through so much,

28:05.898 --> 28:07.665
even before Sam was taken.

28:07.733 --> 28:10.235
They lost a son,

28:10.303 --> 28:13.404
some complication
in a clinical trial,

28:13.472 --> 28:15.773
and they blamed each other,

28:15.841 --> 28:18.576
their marriage broke up, and if
they can get past all of that,

28:18.644 --> 28:21.278
who am I to hang on to anything?

28:21.346 --> 28:24.281
The thing is, you're right. It
is hard to forget some things.

28:24.349 --> 28:26.918
Like you conspiring against me
with your ex, like...

28:26.986 --> 28:29.253
(phone ringing)
It's Vincent.

28:29.321 --> 28:31.389
He's trying to figure out
who framed you.

28:31.456 --> 28:34.025
Look, why don't we table this
for now and just focus

28:34.092 --> 28:35.359
on solving the case. Go ahead

28:35.427 --> 28:36.760
and answer it.
Okay.

28:36.828 --> 28:38.295
Hey, did you find anything?

28:38.363 --> 28:39.730
Yeah. We I.D.'d those bones.

28:39.797 --> 28:41.399
Okay, I'm gonna put you
on speaker.

28:41.466 --> 28:43.267
I'm here with Gabe, groveling.

28:43.335 --> 28:44.902
Great.

28:44.969 --> 28:46.637
Vincent.
Hey.

28:46.704 --> 28:49.640
The bones?
Yeah, the, uh,

28:49.707 --> 28:53.209
the victims were all
from your orphanage, Gabe.

28:53.277 --> 28:56.079
Okay, so whoever framed you
must've known about that connection.

28:56.147 --> 28:57.748
All of us orphans were subject

28:57.815 --> 28:59.449
to Muirfield's
medical experiments.

28:59.517 --> 29:01.117
Do you think this was someone
from Muirfield again?

29:01.185 --> 29:02.818
I don't know. You said
Sam and Dana's son

29:02.886 --> 29:04.921
was part of a
clinical trial.

29:04.988 --> 29:07.156
You know, that research I
did on Frank Darnell,

29:07.223 --> 29:10.492
he filed a case against
a medical company

29:10.560 --> 29:12.594
over a gene therapy protocol
they ran.

29:12.662 --> 29:14.930
Never went to court,
but I pulled the motion.

29:14.997 --> 29:18.667
Sam Landon's one
of the co-petitioners.

29:18.734 --> 29:21.197
Dana did say she recognized
Darnell's name.

29:21.222 --> 29:21.970
They were deposed

29:21.971 --> 29:24.105
on the same day. They had
to have met each other.

29:24.173 --> 29:26.407
But Sam keeps insisting
he thought Darnell was Barnes.

29:26.475 --> 29:27.508
He's lying.

29:27.577 --> 29:29.611
Probably was the one who I.D.'d

29:29.679 --> 29:31.846
your photo.
And he is the one

29:31.914 --> 29:34.248
that invited us
to the vow renewal as security.

29:34.316 --> 29:35.483
Sounds like we got to figure out
what that's about.

29:35.551 --> 29:37.686
Okay, we'll go to JT's?

29:37.753 --> 29:39.520
We can bring Mexico with us.

29:39.588 --> 29:41.589
Sure.

29:41.656 --> 29:42.623
Okay.

29:43.725 --> 29:45.093
Well...

29:45.160 --> 29:48.096
it looks like that window
just closed.

29:55.860 --> 29:57.594
CATHERINE: <i>Okay, so all this started</i>
<i>when I questioned Sam</i>

29:57.661 --> 29:59.428
about the space
below his dungeon.

29:59.497 --> 30:01.330
That's when he invited me
to the vow renewal as a guest

30:01.398 --> 30:03.967
and I told him that I had plans.
Which you did.

30:04.034 --> 30:06.602
Next call I got,
Sam had been attacked.

30:06.669 --> 30:08.304
That's when he got all of us
to change our plans.

30:08.372 --> 30:09.838
So you think
he orchestrated that?

30:09.906 --> 30:11.507
VINCENT: Well, he didn't
have many injuries.

30:11.574 --> 30:13.876
He knew that I'd find the bones
and that ultimately

30:13.943 --> 30:15.878
we'd be able to link it to him.
That's why he needed

30:15.945 --> 30:17.380
to throw suspicion
on somebody else.

30:17.447 --> 30:18.847
I think he was
trying to buy time.

30:18.915 --> 30:20.649
Until what?
Until...

30:20.717 --> 30:22.518
whatever he has planned
for the vow renewal. (phone beeps)

30:22.585 --> 30:23.819
Harrison's near the border.

30:23.887 --> 30:25.353
Maybe he was planning
to flee the country.

30:25.421 --> 30:26.688
Whoa, whoa. I
just got a hit

30:26.756 --> 30:29.024
on our APB.
Donaldson's in Harrison.

30:29.091 --> 30:30.792
He's one of the guys
who assaulted Sam.

30:30.860 --> 30:33.996
Okay, so maybe Sam ordered
another attack on himself.

30:34.063 --> 30:36.364
Maybe that's how he's planning
to escape, fake his own abduction.

30:36.432 --> 30:38.634
I mean, he's played the victim
for the last six years--

30:38.701 --> 30:39.867
it's been his M.O.

30:39.935 --> 30:41.016
We can't let him disappear.

30:41.070 --> 30:42.237
He's our only lead to Barnes.

30:42.304 --> 30:43.671
Gabe, do we have enough
to charge him?

30:43.739 --> 30:45.373
No, we got to catch him
in the act of something.

30:45.441 --> 30:47.575
And the best way to do that is
to let him think that his plan

30:47.643 --> 30:50.078
is working, con the con man.

30:50.146 --> 30:51.913
Well, his con is to make us
think you're the bad guy.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.814
Then you better
find yourself a new date.

31:02.457 --> 31:05.492
(birds chirping)

31:05.561 --> 31:07.028
(indistinct chatter)

31:07.095 --> 31:09.030
(horse neighs)

31:12.833 --> 31:14.401
They're here.

31:14.469 --> 31:15.835
Any sign of Donaldson?

31:15.903 --> 31:17.171
No.
So, what,

31:17.238 --> 31:18.572
you're just calling me
to give me

31:18.639 --> 31:20.274
a heads-up
before they walk in the door?

31:20.341 --> 31:23.444
You do realize I'm sitting alone
in a parking lot

31:23.511 --> 31:25.112
watching her
with her ex-boyfriend.

31:25.180 --> 31:26.180
Oh, my God,

31:26.247 --> 31:28.348
they look like Brangelina.

31:28.416 --> 31:31.217
Uh, he means Sam and Dana,
but I got to go.

31:31.285 --> 31:32.452
Hi.

31:34.689 --> 31:36.355
You look beautiful.
Thank you.

31:36.423 --> 31:38.592
Dana, this place is really, uh...
Kitschy, right?

31:38.659 --> 31:41.628
No, I was going to say romantic.
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry that I ruined things

31:41.696 --> 31:44.197
for you and the ADA.
No, that's okay. It's better I know now

31:44.264 --> 31:46.566
than, you know, be married
and eight months pregnant.

31:46.633 --> 31:49.202
SAM: Honey, I think
we should check in.

31:49.269 --> 31:52.238
I'm gonna go talk to Gabe,
find out if he's seen anything.

31:52.306 --> 31:54.574
He hasn't.
I'm gonna go check the perimeter.

31:54.641 --> 31:55.409
You okay?

31:55.434 --> 31:57.561
Yeah, yeah, just can't really
sense anything in here,

31:57.811 --> 31:59.378
you know, with
all the flowers.

31:59.446 --> 32:02.447
Weird, how people
like flowers.

32:10.156 --> 32:12.091
(rhythmic beeping)

32:20.633 --> 32:22.567
(beeping continues)

32:33.579 --> 32:35.947
GABE:
Vincent?

32:36.015 --> 32:39.416
Vincent, what's going on?
I saw you go outside...

32:40.819 --> 32:42.020
What?

32:48.360 --> 32:50.261
This is right below the chapel.

32:52.597 --> 32:55.199
I don't think Sam's plan
is to fake his own death.

32:57.536 --> 32:59.836
So, this is what
love looks like.

32:59.904 --> 33:01.639
You're supposed to be
looking for Donaldson.

33:01.706 --> 33:03.707
And this is what needing
a green card looks like,

33:03.775 --> 33:06.977
or having a shotgun wedding.
Right, so love is bogus,

33:07.045 --> 33:08.611
flowers are hideous,
and let me guess,

33:08.680 --> 33:10.380
you hated the chocolates, too.

33:10.447 --> 33:13.550
Good news, our vow renewal
package includes bouquets

33:13.617 --> 33:15.552
and boutonnieres
for our wedding party.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.954
Wow.

33:18.022 --> 33:19.106
Where's Vincent?

33:19.131 --> 33:20.557
Oh, he just went out
to check the perimeter,

33:20.558 --> 33:22.125
make sure you're safe.

33:22.193 --> 33:24.627
But we're, uh... (laughs)
We're up next.

33:24.695 --> 33:27.197
(beeping) This thing must be
set by remote,

33:27.264 --> 33:30.567
which means Sam
can detonate it at any moment.

33:30.634 --> 33:31.901
Look, he invited you here;

33:31.968 --> 33:33.869
he obviously wants
to kill you, too.

33:33.937 --> 33:35.538
Hopefully, he waits until
you return before he...

33:35.606 --> 33:36.839
you know,

33:36.907 --> 33:40.743
blows you all up
to get you off his trail.

33:40.811 --> 33:42.878
I'm gonna need some tools.

33:42.946 --> 33:44.980
We don't have any. And we don't
have any time, either.

33:45.048 --> 33:47.049
I think we need to
let this thing go off.

33:47.117 --> 33:48.250
Excuse me?

33:50.286 --> 33:52.354
Right now, Sam thinks
that you all think

33:52.422 --> 33:53.856
that I'm the bad
guy. So, if I die,

33:53.924 --> 33:55.357
then the bad guy's gone.

33:55.425 --> 33:57.693
Case closed. He'll think
that you guys will stop

33:57.760 --> 33:59.361
investigating, and he
won't have to kill you.

33:59.429 --> 34:02.197
I'm still back on you die?
Obviously, not really,

34:02.265 --> 34:04.165
because you're gonna
save me from the bomb.

34:06.143 --> 34:09.411
You will save me, right?

34:09.478 --> 34:11.815
Yes, Gabe, I will save you.

34:14.818 --> 34:15.984
JT:
Congrats.

34:16.052 --> 34:18.587
Hey.
Oh, hey, is everything okay?

34:18.655 --> 34:19.489
Yeah, all good.

34:19.514 --> 34:21.309
Great, let's get this show
on the road. Okay?

34:21.491 --> 34:24.627
Yeah, Sam wants us to take our seats
so he and Dana can walk in together.

34:24.695 --> 34:28.264
Sam Landon? ADA Lowan, although
apparently you already know that.

34:28.331 --> 34:29.179
I need to talk to you.

34:29.204 --> 34:31.065
VINCENT: Gabe, come on, not now,
they're about to get married.

34:31.067 --> 34:33.302
GABE: I just need to clear up
a misunderstanding that I don't think

34:33.370 --> 34:34.837
Sam wants his
bride to hear.

34:34.904 --> 34:36.839
Excuse me a minute,
sweetheart.

34:36.906 --> 34:38.808
Sam, what is it?
It'll be okay.

34:38.875 --> 34:40.309
This better be quick.

34:43.580 --> 34:46.047
Vincent, what's going on?
Okay, there's a bomb.

34:46.114 --> 34:46.625
What?

34:46.650 --> 34:48.951
Yes. You need to get her out
the back entrance right now.

34:48.952 --> 34:49.829
But Sam just went with Gabe.

34:49.853 --> 34:51.853
It's okay. Tess, JT,
clear the building, okay?

34:52.088 --> 34:53.414
What do you mean?
What is this about?

34:53.438 --> 34:54.989
Don't worry, all right?
We got your husband.

34:54.989 --> 34:57.059
Everything is gonna be fine.
You need to come with me.

34:57.060 --> 34:59.328
No, I'm not leaving until you tell...
Come on.

35:01.797 --> 35:04.466
Framed you?
I just pointed out the facts.

35:04.533 --> 35:07.235
The fact is you planted
that vial of serum.

35:07.302 --> 35:09.170
Now they all think
you're the innocent victim

35:09.238 --> 35:10.905
and I'm the one
working for Barnes.

35:10.973 --> 35:13.207
You ruined my relationship,
my reputation.

35:13.275 --> 35:15.810
So you better confess,

35:15.878 --> 35:18.246
or I am gonna tell everyone
the truth about you.

35:18.313 --> 35:20.814
Starting with Dana.

35:23.151 --> 35:25.319
Okay.

35:25.387 --> 35:27.320
That's the way
you want to play it.

35:41.769 --> 35:43.736
(sighs)

35:43.804 --> 35:44.771
(beep)

35:44.838 --> 35:46.372
(fast beeping)

35:50.477 --> 35:52.879
Catherine, what are you doing here?
I wasn't gonna leave you here.

35:52.946 --> 35:54.447
<i>Yeah, but where's Vincent?</i>
<i>Sam's about to blow...</i>

35:54.515 --> 35:56.248
(beeping)

36:04.457 --> 36:06.392
You okay?
Yeah.

36:16.228 --> 36:18.195
(sirens chirp,
indistinct chatter)

36:24.436 --> 36:25.757
OFFICER:
Nobody's allowed in here.

36:25.804 --> 36:29.440
Please turn around
and go back.

36:29.507 --> 36:31.629
We need two
EMS guys inside.

36:31.630 --> 36:32.963
(Dana sobs)

36:33.712 --> 36:35.309
I know this might not
mean very much,

36:35.310 --> 36:37.711
but Sam didn't intend for you...
For what?

36:37.778 --> 36:39.379
For me to die
at our vow renewal?

36:39.447 --> 36:41.915
He wanted you to walk in
together, right?

36:41.983 --> 36:43.250
He was gonna spare you.

36:43.318 --> 36:44.784
So, what's the plan now?

36:44.852 --> 36:46.420
He needs to think
Gabe didn't make it.

36:46.488 --> 36:48.188
That he's off our radar,
so that he'll continue

36:48.256 --> 36:50.724
with whatever his plan is,
and maybe lead us to Barnes.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.092
So, no arrests?

36:52.159 --> 36:54.293
We just have to act like
life is normal?

36:54.361 --> 36:55.795
For now.

36:55.863 --> 36:57.130
Well, I can't do that.
I can't pretend

36:57.197 --> 36:58.598
that I don't know anything,

36:58.666 --> 37:00.967
that the man that I love
isn't a sociopath.

37:01.035 --> 37:03.402
We haven't told him yet
whether or not you made it.

37:07.508 --> 37:11.144
I get to decide whether I go
into Witness Protection or not?

37:12.979 --> 37:15.248
Someplace sunny.

37:17.050 --> 37:18.584
You know, the vows
that I wrote,

37:18.652 --> 37:21.120
they were for the man
that I lost six years ago.

37:21.188 --> 37:23.822
All that time
with Barnes changed him.

37:23.890 --> 37:25.590
But I'm a profiler.

37:25.659 --> 37:28.226
I was so focused
on who he had been

37:28.294 --> 37:30.562
that I couldn't see
what he had become.

37:30.630 --> 37:33.265
I know what that's like.

37:35.669 --> 37:37.502
(sighs)

37:37.570 --> 37:39.271
Okay, you got to go.

37:39.338 --> 37:40.639
Yeah, I do.

37:40.706 --> 37:42.006
Before he sees you.

37:49.048 --> 37:50.148
♪ Running through the heat

37:50.216 --> 37:51.816
♪ Heartbeat

37:51.884 --> 37:55.019
♪ You shine like silver
in the sunlight ♪

37:55.087 --> 37:58.122

37:58.190 --> 37:59.623
♪ It feels right...

37:59.692 --> 38:00.792
VINCENT:
You hiding out

38:00.859 --> 38:01.926
until Sam's gone?

38:01.994 --> 38:03.527
Yeah.

38:03.595 --> 38:06.030
Looks like this time
I have to be the dead guy.

38:06.098 --> 38:07.098
Well,

38:07.166 --> 38:08.632
I recommend a home gym.

38:08.701 --> 38:10.668
And collect some
decent takeout menus.

38:10.736 --> 38:13.170
Catherine doesn't mind
eating in.

38:13.238 --> 38:15.172
This 'cause
you're feeling guilty

38:15.240 --> 38:16.940
about breaking into my loft?

38:17.008 --> 38:18.642
You're giving me pointers
on dating your ex?

38:18.710 --> 38:20.977
Dating my friend.

38:21.045 --> 38:23.614
It's gonna take me a bit
to get used to this...

38:23.682 --> 38:24.948
friendship of yours.

38:25.016 --> 38:28.118
Yeah, me, too, believe me.

38:28.186 --> 38:30.520
But as her friend, I'm gonna be
a little protective.

38:30.588 --> 38:32.522
Especially since
I'm the reason

38:32.590 --> 38:34.524
that she doesn't
really trust anyone.

38:36.094 --> 38:38.461
Look, just give her
a second chance, huh?

38:38.529 --> 38:40.296
And yes,

38:40.364 --> 38:42.665
I'm sorry about breaking
into your loft.

38:42.734 --> 38:46.236
Actually, I think I'm the one
who owes you an apology.

38:46.303 --> 38:48.638
All this time,
I've been trying to make amends.

38:48.706 --> 38:51.708
I don't think
I ever told you that I'm sorry.

38:51.775 --> 38:53.695
(phone vibrates)
For what, for trying to kill me?

38:53.744 --> 38:56.479
You had to say it.

38:56.547 --> 38:57.847
(phone beeps)

38:57.914 --> 38:59.048
Sam's gone.

39:00.284 --> 39:01.683
I'm gonna go look for your,

39:01.752 --> 39:03.853
uh, friend.

39:09.893 --> 39:12.494
VINCENT:
<i>I can't be with her, JT.</i>

39:12.562 --> 39:14.096
Ugh, what is wrong
with people?

39:14.164 --> 39:15.865
You should just wear black
on Valentine's Day.

39:15.932 --> 39:17.566
(chuckles)
I don't deserve her, man.

39:17.634 --> 39:18.933
Yes, you do.

39:19.001 --> 39:22.003
I mean,
you just saved your rival.

39:22.071 --> 39:23.372
You could've let him die,

39:23.439 --> 39:25.407
blown to smithereens,
but you didn't.

39:25.475 --> 39:27.442
That is very deserving.
Yes, okay,

39:27.510 --> 39:29.510
I'll admit that I did
the right thing for a change,

39:29.512 --> 39:30.746
but I haven't,

39:30.813 --> 39:33.114
not to her especially,
for a long time.

39:34.917 --> 39:37.718
And yes, I love her,

39:37.787 --> 39:39.120
enough to let her
be with someone

39:39.188 --> 39:41.222
who is worthy.

39:41.290 --> 39:43.224
So, that's it?

39:43.292 --> 39:45.626
You're just gonna let her go?

39:47.830 --> 39:50.064
Okay, but at some point,

39:50.132 --> 39:51.932
you'll feel worthier, right?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.467
And then you'll win her back,

39:53.535 --> 39:54.868
because this isn't
how the musical ends.

39:54.936 --> 39:56.470
(laughs)

39:56.538 --> 39:57.705
TESS:
Hey.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.107
Oh, hey.

40:00.175 --> 40:02.610
Um, well,

40:02.678 --> 40:05.112
I'll go and figure out
our transportation situation.

40:05.180 --> 40:07.080
I think there's
a horse and sleigh

40:07.148 --> 40:08.816
around here somewhere.

40:08.883 --> 40:10.250
(sighs)

40:12.287 --> 40:14.487
Look, I didn't hate
the chocolates.

40:14.555 --> 40:16.290
(chuckles) Yeah, well,

40:16.357 --> 40:18.225
I got carried away

40:18.293 --> 40:19.927
with this whole
"seize the day" thing,

40:19.994 --> 40:21.295
and apparently,

40:21.362 --> 40:22.562
I found a bad florist.

40:22.630 --> 40:24.331
Look, you calling in
that fake case

40:24.398 --> 40:27.066
is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

40:27.134 --> 40:28.468
So I got

40:28.536 --> 40:30.837
carried away, too.

40:32.807 --> 40:35.074
(laughs)

40:35.142 --> 40:36.943
GABE: <i>I should've told you</i>
<i>about Mexico.</i>

40:37.010 --> 40:38.745
You wanted it to
be a surprise.

40:38.813 --> 40:41.247
Yeah, but I should have realized
after you pulled your gun on me

40:41.315 --> 40:44.583
in the dungeon that the lady
doesn't like surprises.

40:44.651 --> 40:46.785
The truth is, I've been making

40:46.854 --> 40:49.621
all these grand gestures--
Mexico, coffee...

40:49.689 --> 40:50.923
I like coffee.

40:50.991 --> 40:52.458
Because I've been
overcompensating

40:52.525 --> 40:54.994
for all the horrible things
I've done.

40:55.062 --> 40:57.529
You don't have to.

40:57.597 --> 40:59.037
You're not the person
you used to be.

40:59.098 --> 41:00.666
And I have to trust that.

41:00.734 --> 41:02.668
I do trust that.

41:02.736 --> 41:04.436
It's just...

41:04.504 --> 41:06.137
I got confused.

41:06.205 --> 41:08.474
I've been hurt
so much in the past.

41:08.541 --> 41:10.208
I'm not gonna hurt you.

41:12.512 --> 41:14.445
I know.
