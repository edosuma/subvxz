00:01.160 --> 00:02.764
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars

00:02.800 --> 00:04.119
We all saw _
where he was standing,

00:04.170 --> 00:05.364
by the coolers
where they keep the blood.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.492
Our blood.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.167
We still d_oh:t know _ _
why he was VISItIng All In Jail

00:08.200 --> 00:09.462
or why he fought
with Mona.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.307
My dad doesn't think
that I'm college material.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.228
He thinks Kate is.
Who is Kate?

00:13.280 --> 00:14.508
My stupid,
perfect step-sister.

00:14.540 --> 00:15.632
Kate.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.045
You know, training a horse,
it's an art.

00:17.080 --> 00:20.208
Taking all the fight out of it
until it truly is broken.

00:20.250 --> 00:22.138
That's how you're gonna feel
when I'm through with you.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.384
Welcome to the family.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.479
The winner
gets $20,000 scholarship.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.283
We're gonna have to pay
for my tuition somehow.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.287
What's wrong?

00:28.320 --> 00:29.480
You're married, Talia.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.782
Cyrus?
Back away from them!

00:31.830 --> 00:34.253
Now!

00:34.300 --> 00:36.393
You told me that you were hired
to paint a mural for Hollis.

00:36.430 --> 00:38.091
I did not say "hired."
I was careful about that.

00:38.130 --> 00:39.131
Well, do you know
what else you didn't say?

00:39.170 --> 00:40.262
Vandalism.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.234
HOLBROOK: Although
we did not find a body,

00:42.270 --> 00:43.498
the amount of blood
in the house

00:43.540 --> 00:45.508
would indicate that the
victim's wounds are fatal.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.405
Mona Vanderwaal
was murdered.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.476
"Thanks for donating
to my get-into—jail fund.

00:49.510 --> 00:50.704
_ All

01:03.460 --> 01:04.654
What?
Did you find something?

01:04.690 --> 01:06.328
Yeah.
My brother's got jock itch.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.520
Ew.
Wish I didn't know that.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.168
What's with all this
new gym eqUIpment?

01:11.200 --> 01:12.292
I don't know.
He's obsessed.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.295
It's nice.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.659
How much
did he pay for this?

01:14.700 --> 01:16.338
Hanna?_
We're not shopping here.

01:16.370 --> 01:17.701
Okay, it's just a question.

01:17.740 --> 01:19.173
I mean, I want to know

01:19.210 --> 01:20.734
why Mike's
all of a sudden training

01:20.780 --> 01:21.872
to become a ninja.

01:21.910 --> 01:23.446
Maybe because
he's running errands

01:23.480 --> 01:25.243
for a blonde spider
in cellblock H.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.578
Okay, guys, just stop.

01:27.620 --> 01:28.575
This feels wrong.

01:28.620 --> 01:30.884
No, what's wrong is Mike
stealing our stem cells

01:30.920 --> 01:32.319
and handing them over
to Ali's "A"-team.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.816
Hanna, we don't know
what was in that

01:33.860 --> 01:35.179
envelope he gave Cyrus.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.448
It could've been cash.
Right.

01:36.490 --> 01:38.253
So maybe he's hiding
our DNA in here

01:38.290 --> 01:39.188
until hegets further
instructions.

01:39.230 --> 01:41.653
Has anybody checked
that mini-fridge yet?

01:43.470 --> 01:45.358
What about the gym bag?
No, I got it.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.564
If your brother did send
that bloody "A" text,

01:50.610 --> 01:51.736
then we should be
doing more than

01:51.770 --> 01:53.328
turning his room inside out.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.335
We should be
setting fire to--

01:54.380 --> 01:55.699
Guys.

01:57.880 --> 01:58.778
Did you find
that in here?

01:58.810 --> 02:00.869
It was under
a really disgusting gym sock.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.342
Wait.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.711
He just bought this
last Friday.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.411
Who is it for?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.587
And when did your
brother acquire taste?

02:08.620 --> 02:09.655
Why does Mike
have that?

02:09.690 --> 02:12.227
Maybe he ordered it for Mona
and it just got in.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.553
Maybe
it's a Mother's Day gift.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.897
I don't think
he's telling his mom

02:16.930 --> 02:18.568
"I'm with you."

02:18.600 --> 02:20.488
These aren't just beads.
It's a message, in Morse code.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.269
I've seen these
advertised onllne.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.902
The beads,
they spell out words.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.635
"I'm with you?"
With who?

02:25.670 --> 02:26.876
That necklace is
probably for Alison.

02:26.910 --> 02:28.275
That's who Mike's with.

02:34.350 --> 02:36.580
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

02:36.620 --> 02:39.350
* Swear this one
you'll save *

02:39.390 --> 02:41.654
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:41.690 --> 02:44.420
* Taking this one
to the grave *

02:44.460 --> 02:46.428
* If I show you,
then I know *

02:46.460 --> 02:49.429
* You won't tell
what I saId *

02:49.470 --> 02:51.825
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

02:51.870 --> 02:54.236
* If one of them
is dead *

02:55.770 --> 02:57.362
Oh, please.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.809
If my customers
knew it was lard,

02:58.840 --> 03:00.398
they'd shove me
in the oven.

03:02.380 --> 03:03.677
It's your mom.

03:03.710 --> 03:05.678
I'll email it.
Okay.

03:05.710 --> 03:06.847
Bye.

03:08.020 --> 03:09.339
Didn't she want
to talk to me?

03:09.390 --> 03:10.345
No.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.585
She just called about
that leftover cobbler

03:12.620 --> 03:13.712
you brought home
last week.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.819
What?

03:15.860 --> 03:17.919
Isn't it nice that we have
something In common

03:17.960 --> 03:19.188
besides you?

03:21.360 --> 03:22.827
Do you think
she knows about...

03:22.870 --> 03:25.498
Us?
Not from me.

03:25.530 --> 03:26.997
We are moving slowly, Emily.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.531
And I am perfectly fine
with you

03:29.570 --> 03:31.663
and me staying
just between you and me.

03:31.710 --> 03:33.871
And your husband.

03:33.910 --> 03:35.377
That's right.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.212
Do you just wake up
this beautiful?

03:54.760 --> 03:56.591
Oh. Hey, Mike.

03:56.630 --> 03:59.633
We're not actually open yet.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.732
Well, the door is open.

04:04.810 --> 04:06.778
Can I get
some coffee to go?

04:06.810 --> 04:08.402
Yeah.

04:15.650 --> 04:16.844
I'm gonna need two.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.539
Okay.

04:29.400 --> 04:33.063
Do you want to bring
a pastry or something?

04:33.100 --> 04:34.397
No, they're both for me.

04:35.540 --> 04:36.700
It was a long night.

04:36.740 --> 04:37.764
Oh, really?

04:37.810 --> 04:40.370
What were you up to?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.344
I've already got
one big sister.

04:43.750 --> 04:44.808
Not looking for another.

04:57.890 --> 05:00.097
I know your mom loves
the idea of shipping you off

05:00.130 --> 05:02.018
to Hogwarts,
but what about you?

05:02.060 --> 05:04.824
Are you freaked out
about living overseas?

05:04.870 --> 05:06.394
No.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.395
Why?
Should I be?

05:07.440 --> 05:08.589
No, you'll be fine.

05:08.640 --> 05:09.800
I, on the other hand,
needed a horse pill

05:09.840 --> 05:11.535
just to get across the ocean.

05:11.570 --> 05:12.605
My advice is, don't take it

05:12.640 --> 05:13.800
'til the wheels are off
the runway.

05:13.840 --> 05:14.807
Why?
What happened?

05:14.840 --> 05:15.807
Faulty equipment.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.341
We had to get off
the plane.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.847
I was fast asleep,
I got wheeled around

05:18.880 --> 05:21.678
on a luggage cart by
a bank teller from Parma, Ohio.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.688
You slept the whole time?

05:23.720 --> 05:24.789
I have no memory.

05:24.820 --> 05:27.482
Zip. I mean I'm told I ate
a fish taco in my sleep.

05:31.730 --> 05:32.697
Hey.

05:32.730 --> 05:33.822
Hey.

05:35.430 --> 05:36.727
How's it going?
Um.

05:38.070 --> 05:40.561
Good.
You remember Jonny?

05:40.600 --> 05:41.589
Yeah.
Hey.

05:44.140 --> 05:45.607
What are you doing here
at Hollis?

05:45.640 --> 05:48.871
My dad just asked me
to pick up some class

05:48.910 --> 05:51.003
schedules for Jenna.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.574
What are you doing here?

05:52.620 --> 05:54.838
Uh, Jonny has an old friend

05:54.880 --> 05:57.019
who has an Oxford connection
and he just--

05:57.050 --> 05:59.518
It doesn't matter.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.857
But how've you been?

06:00.890 --> 06:02.778
Is Tanner
still making you work 24/7?

06:02.830 --> 06:04.582
Pretty much.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.467
Well,
if you're free tonight--

06:09.500 --> 06:12.992
I'm not.
But I'll call you later.

06:14.170 --> 06:15.592
Sure.
Okay.

06:18.770 --> 06:19.976
Uh, it was
to nice see you again.

06:20.010 --> 06:20.999
Same here.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.678
( speaking in Italian )

06:25.180 --> 06:26.613
What was that?

06:26.650 --> 06:29.517
It's an expression.
In Italian.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.650
And completely
pretentious.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.718
The necklace said
"I am with you."

06:38.760 --> 06:40.125
Why are you
so sure it's for Ali?

06:40.160 --> 06:41.559
Who else?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.727
Mike has been to her jail cell
more than once.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.965
And he's meeting up
with her sketchy friends,

06:46.000 --> 06:47.729
leaving candy grams
in the woods.

06:47.770 --> 06:49.931
And he just took out
a huge withdrawal

06:49.970 --> 06:51.506
from "A's" bank account
last week.

06:51.540 --> 06:56.102
So he's using Alison's money
to buy gifts for Alison?

06:56.140 --> 06:57.107
Classy.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.640
( cell phone beeps )

07:07.990 --> 07:09.787
Do you want me to say
something to Aria's brother?

07:09.830 --> 07:11.980
No!
No, God, no.

07:13.230 --> 07:14.549
( cell phone beeps )

07:16.830 --> 07:19.060
Why aren't you answering it?
Is that Aria?

07:19.100 --> 07:20.499
No.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.428
I'll just call her later.

07:28.140 --> 07:30.074
"Her?"

07:30.110 --> 07:32.044
What's going on?

07:32.080 --> 07:33.115
Nothing.

07:35.980 --> 07:37.641
I don't even know if I'm gonna
go through with this.

07:37.690 --> 07:38.816
This coach is pricey

07:38.850 --> 07:39.817
and if it's going
to cost me money

07:39.860 --> 07:41.111
just to be
in this thing--

07:41.160 --> 07:42.115
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.082
Speak English.

07:45.990 --> 07:48.550
_ I enrolled
In a beauty pageant.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.465
Miss Teen, county-wide.

07:53.070 --> 07:55.891
The winner
gets $20,000 prize.

07:55.940 --> 07:57.828
I could use
that towards my tuition.

07:57.870 --> 07:59.508
Okay, stop.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.735
There has to be a better way
to bankroll college

08:01.780 --> 08:03.600
than parading around
in a bikini

08:03.650 --> 08:06.869
and being judged like a heifer
at a 4-H fair.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.549
Caleb, this is not about
big hair and twirling a baton.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.854
I have to have this money
so I can get out of this town.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.710
Okay, let me help you.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.888
You know, we'll call my mom
in Santa Barbara.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.727
The guy that she's married to,
he's loaded.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.591
We'll ask them
for a loan.

08:21.630 --> 08:23.666
Yeah.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.998
After my dad basically
slammed the door in my face?

08:26.030 --> 08:29.158
No way. I am not asking
anyone for anymore help.

08:30.340 --> 08:31.830
Fine.

08:31.870 --> 08:33.735
But have you really thought
this through?

08:33.780 --> 08:36.237
That pageant
world is squeaky-clean,

08:36.280 --> 08:38.748
and last week you were
modeling a hazmat suit

08:41.920 --> 08:43.808
I already
talked myself into this.

08:43.850 --> 08:46.580
I don't need any other reason
to back out.

08:46.620 --> 08:49.180
I'm going to do this.
I have to.

08:50.190 --> 08:51.088
Listen,
if that was awkward,

08:51.130 --> 08:52.893
you could've just
introduced me as the guy

08:52.930 --> 08:54.659
who lives in the barn.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.622
I wasn't introducing you.
Toby knows you.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.820
Yeah, well, I think
he'd rather know me as the guy

08:58.870 --> 09:00.167
who lives in the barn.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.737
Okay, well, this has
nothing to do with you, Jonny.

09:02.770 --> 09:05.204
I mean a lot of stuff's been
gomg on and Toby's

09:05.240 --> 09:08.038
just removed himself,
not just from me,

09:08.080 --> 09:10.640
but from everybody.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.772
Jonny?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.949
What's going on?
What's wrong?

09:19.690 --> 09:20.850
Isn't that...

09:21.960 --> 09:23.552
our vandalism?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.824
Why did they call it
"The Trial of the Century"?

09:30.870 --> 09:32.667
Um...

09:32.700 --> 09:35.168
Because
Clarence Darrow was--

09:35.200 --> 09:35.962
No, there's
no Clarence Darrow.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.605
That was Scopes.
Different decade.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.629
Oh.

09:49.950 --> 09:53.215
Trial of the Century:
Stanford White case.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.717
First time a psychiatric defense
was ever successful.

09:57.190 --> 09:58.987
Harry Thaw shot
Stanford White because he...

09:59.030 --> 10:03.319
Oh, um, because
he was jealous

10:03.370 --> 10:05.930
of his relationship
with Evelyn Biscuit.

10:05.970 --> 10:07.938
Nesbit.

10:07.970 --> 10:10.336
Nesbit.
Yeah, that's what I said.

10:14.880 --> 10:15.869
Um...

10:18.010 --> 10:19.147
Oh, thanks.

10:19.180 --> 10:20.716
Do you want
to take a break?

10:20.750 --> 10:22.308
I know your head's not
in this game right now.

10:22.350 --> 10:23.715
And if you're worried about
your brother...

10:23.750 --> 10:26.241
I'm worried about
a lot actually.

10:26.290 --> 10:28.155
You know what?

10:28.190 --> 10:29.885
There is something that
you can help me with.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.399
So, my brother goes down
to this gym on East Elm.

10:34.430 --> 10:35.829
Could you follow him there?

10:35.860 --> 10:37.122
Just go in and see
if he's meeting someone?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.991
I mean I'd go myself,
but if he saw me there--

10:40.040 --> 10:41.894
Got it.
I'm on It.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.405
Were you in my room?

10:44.440 --> 10:45.407
What?

10:45.440 --> 10:46.202
You were in my room.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.879
Why the hell were
you in my room?

10:48.910 --> 10:50.138
Mike!

10:50.180 --> 10:51.306
Calm down.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.977
1-1 was just
doing laundry.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.079
I don't keep underwear
in my desk, Aria.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.839
I'm gonna go outside
and make a call.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.017
You have no right to be
going through my things.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.016
What are you worried
about me finding, Mike?

11:02.060 --> 11:03.755
None of your damn business!

11:03.790 --> 11:06.156
And, I swear, if you
touch any of my things again,

11:06.190 --> 11:07.657
you will live to regret it!

11:26.280 --> 11:27.417
Compelling, aren't they?

11:28.520 --> 11:31.444
Is this a joke?
This is my work.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.253
Your work?

11:33.290 --> 11:34.257
Really?

11:34.290 --> 11:35.109
_Yeah.
MIne, too.

11:35.160 --> 11:38.926
I helped-- I--
This was all one piece.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.029
Not when I received them.

11:40.060 --> 11:41.823
Received them?
From who?

11:43.030 --> 11:44.497
You can't just stick these
in fancy frames

11:44.530 --> 11:46.498
_and then sell them
Without my permISSIon.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.088
I'm sorry,
who brought these here?

11:49.240 --> 11:51.333
Somebody from Hollis
saved them from being

11:51.370 --> 11:53.179
hauled off
in a garbage truck.

11:53.210 --> 11:55.428
So technically,
they're mine.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.879
Until someone buys them.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.011
I have a list of questions here
from last year's pageant.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.813
Let's try a few.

12:06.960 --> 12:07.915
How would you reverse

12:07.960 --> 12:11.384
the extinction of today's
endangered species?

12:17.870 --> 12:18.620
What is your opinion of our

12:18.670 --> 12:21.138
country's
current foreign policy?

12:27.440 --> 12:31.171
Hanna, these pageants
aren't just about being

12:31.210 --> 12:32.245
pretty anymore.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.315
Pretty isn't the point.

12:33.350 --> 12:37.389
Judges don't give out
crowns to living lollipops.

12:37.420 --> 12:40.184
You need to have an opinion
about the world we live in.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.154
I do.

12:42.190 --> 12:43.487
Good.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.521
Let's talk about
the talent portion.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.152
Have you given that
any thought?

12:50.900 --> 12:52.424
What do you do well?

12:54.240 --> 12:55.332
Lots of things.

12:55.370 --> 12:56.769
As in?

13:00.180 --> 13:04.503
Hanna, look,
if you really want this,

13:04.550 --> 13:07.110
you've got to feel it
on a cellular level.

13:07.150 --> 13:09.414
There are girls that have been
training for this

13:09.450 --> 13:12.544
since they could
flush the toilet themselves.

13:12.590 --> 13:14.285
I dance.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.251
That's your talent?

13:17.290 --> 13:19.827
Yeah, I dance.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.324
( cell phone ringing )

13:30.070 --> 13:31.037
Excuse me?

13:31.070 --> 13:33.607
I'm looking for Talia.

13:33.640 --> 13:34.902
Is she in the kitchen?

13:34.940 --> 13:36.498
No.
You just missed her.

13:36.540 --> 13:38.508
She had to leave early
for a catering gig in Philly.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.438
Oh, right.
Immw.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.589
I'll call the landlord.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.588
Can I tell her
who stopped by?

13:45.620 --> 13:47.349
Sorry.
Of course.

13:47.390 --> 13:49.358
I'm Eric,
Talia's husband.

13:52.330 --> 13:53.524
You must be Emily.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.391
Of course.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.128
Right. Um, Talia
talks about you all the time.

14:00.170 --> 14:01.330
She does?

14:01.370 --> 14:02.359
Yeah.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.300
You must be_
something speCIal

14:04.340 --> 14:05.307
if you can get her
to take a bike ride.

14:05.340 --> 14:07.308
I can't get her
to stop working long enough

14:07.340 --> 14:08.637
to walk to the mailbox.

14:08.680 --> 14:13.447
Yeah, well,
it was just an easy ride.

14:13.480 --> 14:17.018
Single lane.
We hardly got off the bikes.

14:21.460 --> 14:22.609
Emily?

14:22.660 --> 14:26.187
I know what's going on
with you and Talia.

14:26.230 --> 14:27.629
You don't have
to feel weird.

14:27.660 --> 14:32.893
Sorry,
I-I-I do.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.430
I didn't know
about you until--

14:34.470 --> 14:36.665
It's okay.
I understand.

14:36.700 --> 14:40.079
Really?
'Cause I'm still--

14:40.110 --> 14:43.045
Look, Talia and I have been
together a long time.

14:43.080 --> 14:48.108
And if she needs to experiment,
have a one-time thing,

14:48.150 --> 14:52.314
I can live with that,
'cause I love her.

14:52.350 --> 14:56.252
And I expect to be doing that
way longer than anyone else.

15:34.230 --> 15:35.049
Egg

15:35.100 --> 15:36.590
Come on in.
Hanna's still in the shower.

15:36.630 --> 15:38.393
Can I get you
some breakfast?

15:38.430 --> 15:39.692
No, I'm okay, thanks.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.698
I can't dance
on a full stomach.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.469
Well, I didn't know
you could dance at all.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.967
Hanna says you've been taking
lessons since you were four.

15:46.010 --> 15:48.638
Three, I stopped when
I was in seventh grade.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.604
My mother was hoping for
a ballerina instead of a jock.

15:51.650 --> 15:55.472
Emily, do you think she knows
what she's getting herself into?

15:55.520 --> 15:57.681
I'm having
disturbing flashbacks

15:57.720 --> 15:59.688
to that campaign
for Homecoming Queen.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.415
That was different.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.020
This pageant isn't about
proving something to herself,

16:04.060 --> 16:05.357
it's only about
winning tuition money.

16:07.460 --> 16:10.293
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean--

16:10.330 --> 16:13.595
It's okay.
It is what it is.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.438
I didn't expect
to be in this position.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.604
Miss Marin,
can I ask you something?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.403
Sure.

16:26.450 --> 16:29.510
Do you think it's okay
to date a person

16:29.550 --> 16:32.383
if some part of you knows
it's not gonna last forever?

16:34.190 --> 16:36.658
I mean, if it's amazing
in the moment,

16:36.690 --> 16:40.091
but ultimately, you think
it's probably doomed?

16:40.130 --> 16:46.262
Are you asking me about me
or are you asking me about you?

16:48.270 --> 16:49.237
Neither.

16:49.270 --> 16:51.409
I'm just curious.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.170
Emily, people get hurt

16:54.210 --> 16:57.475
and disappointed
in relationships every day.

16:57.510 --> 17:00.047
But no one should jump
into one with that intention.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.181
So wait.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.619
And he put it inside the tree?
What was it?

17:10.660 --> 17:11.649
I don't know.

17:11.690 --> 17:12.725
I started to climb up,
but then I heard something

17:12.760 --> 17:15.297
and I thought he was
coming back, so I took off.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.261
I could go back.

17:19.300 --> 17:20.289
No.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.433
It's okay.
You did the right thing.

17:22.470 --> 17:24.267
Your instincts were right.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.402
He's definitely
up to something.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.237
It's in the woods
behind Mona's house.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.679
I know which tree it is,
I could show you.

17:28.710 --> 17:30.803
If you could just describe it,
I've got it from here.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.647
You shouldn't go alone.
Seriously.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.147
I don't think
you should be

17:34.180 --> 17:35.442
alone in the house
with him either.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.380
I won't be.
My dad gets back later.

17:39.290 --> 17:40.780
I'm fine, really.

17:40.820 --> 17:42.549
Are you sure?

17:44.290 --> 17:46.326
'Cause you know I'm here
if you need me.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.197
( banging on door)

17:57.210 --> 17:58.438
Hi.
Hey.

17:58.470 --> 18:00.108
Where's your toolbox?

18:00.140 --> 18:01.175
Why?
Did something break?

18:01.210 --> 18:03.075
No.
I just need your toolbox.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.312
Really,
there's nothing in there

18:08.350 --> 18:10.386
that's gonna help you pick
a lock on a gallery door.

18:10.420 --> 18:13.856
No, but I can
take it off its hinges.

18:13.890 --> 18:15.812
Look, before you plan on
stealing back your own work,

18:15.860 --> 18:17.384
why don't you
let me talk to my mom?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.681
You must have
legal recourse.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.891
Is she into
representing vandals?

18:20.930 --> 18:22.295
Besides,
judges don't like me.

18:22.330 --> 18:23.319
What do you mean?

18:23.370 --> 18:24.223
I mean,
I've been screwed over

18:24.270 --> 18:25.589
by enough authority figures
in my life

18:25.630 --> 18:27.461
to know not to start
trusting them now.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.263
Well, amen to that.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.460
Don't get that look
in your eye.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.704
You're not driving
my getaway car.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.468
not Badlands.

18:36.510 --> 18:38.341
Okay, look,
I know that I said

18:38.380 --> 18:39.369
I needed to be
on the straight and narrow,

18:39.410 --> 18:40.377
but this is different.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.318
You're being exploited.

18:41.350 --> 18:43.238
If he even sells
one of those paintings--

18:43.290 --> 18:44.848
He already has.

18:44.890 --> 18:45.845
What?
I checked online.

18:45.890 --> 18:47.255
Which one?
Corner rabbit.

18:47.290 --> 18:48.359
I painted that!

18:48.390 --> 18:49.516
Where is your toolbox?

19:04.410 --> 19:07.174
* She got a body
like an hourglass *

19:07.210 --> 19:10.373
* But I can give it to you
all the time *

19:10.410 --> 19:12.776
* She got a booty
like a Cadillac *

19:12.810 --> 19:15.916
* But I can send you
into overdrive *

19:17.620 --> 19:19.247
*_You've been
waiting for that *

19:19.290 --> 19:23.829
* Stop, hold up,
swing your bat *

19:23.860 --> 19:25.851
* See anybody
could be bad to you *

19:25.890 --> 19:27.949
* You need a good girl
to blow your mind *

19:28.000 --> 19:29.695
* Yeah

19:34.300 --> 19:35.790
That's where you applaud.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.263
I'm holding
two cheese steaks.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.663
I don't have enough hands.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.678
Well, seriously,
what did you think?

19:41.710 --> 19:43.302
It was good.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.942
"Good?"

19:44.980 --> 19:46.345
Good is not good enough.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.472
Hanna, relax.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.509
We still have time
to make it great.

19:48.550 --> 19:49.642
Yeah, 2 hours.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.319
My coach is coming over here
to check on my progress.

19:52.350 --> 19:53.385
She's your coach.

19:53.420 --> 19:54.956
She's coming by
to support you.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.810
Have you met
Nan Zabriskie?

19:56.860 --> 19:58.725
She makes you feel like
the girl in fat camp

19:58.760 --> 20:00.455
who got caught eating
her toothpaste.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.968
What?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.399
It was minty.

20:05.430 --> 20:07.534
Um, did you forget
the mustard?

20:07.570 --> 20:08.969
No.
It's on there.

20:11.470 --> 20:13.404
Caleb, what's going on?

20:15.510 --> 20:16.829
Somebody else signed up
to be in this pageant.

20:16.880 --> 20:17.904
What do you mean?

20:17.950 --> 20:20.874
VVho?

20:25.490 --> 20:26.445
( exhales )
No freaking way.

20:26.490 --> 20:27.582
What?
Who is it?

20:27.620 --> 20:30.282
Kate Randall has this room
reserved tomorrow at 7 pm.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.456
Kate Randall?

20:31.490 --> 20:34.357
As in your stepsister
Kate Randall?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.389
No, this has to be
someone else.

20:35.430 --> 20:36.749
Really?

20:36.800 --> 20:38.722
That goes to the same
high school as her?

20:38.770 --> 20:41.295
You know, it wasn't enough
that she stole my father

20:41.340 --> 20:42.238
and my college money,

20:42.270 --> 20:43.760
now she wants to go
after my crown, too.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.473
Hanna, wait.
Where are you going?

20:47.510 --> 20:48.738
You cannot just go
and punch her out.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.907
I am going
to the bathroom to pee.

20:50.950 --> 20:51.871
And when I get back,

20:51.910 --> 20:54.378
we are going to rehearse
until it's perfect.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.741
I am not gonna let her
take this away from me.

21:33.890 --> 21:35.016
Can I help?

21:36.090 --> 21:37.455
more than
what I brought.

21:37.490 --> 21:38.821
I got it.

21:50.470 --> 21:52.938
How many times have you been
in the barn when I'm not there?

22:38.190 --> 22:39.487
( scraping )

22:57.000 --> 22:59.036
You're new at this,
aren't you?

22:59.070 --> 23:01.868
* Wait a minute 'till ya

23:01.910 --> 23:04.470
* Bang, bang,
bang, bang *

23:04.510 --> 23:07.479
* Ooh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

23:07.520 --> 23:10.842
* Ooh, bang,
bang, bang, bang *

23:10.890 --> 23:13.916
* Ooh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

23:14.860 --> 23:16.612
*BtotheA
totheN*

23:18.790 --> 23:19.757
Hey.

23:19.790 --> 23:21.621
Hi.
How is she doing?

23:21.660 --> 23:23.469
She's doing good.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.524
I'm not convinced.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.788
Is she having a hard time
keeping up with Emily?

23:26.830 --> 23:28.764
No, no, no,
she's keeping up.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.167
It's who she's competing
against, that's the problem.

23:34.940 --> 23:38.046
* Bang, bang into the room
I know you want it *

23:38.080 --> 23:41.117
* Bang, bang all over you
I'll let you have it *

23:41.150 --> 23:44.540
* Wait a minute,
let me take you there *

23:44.590 --> 23:47.718
* Wait a minute 'til ya

23:47.760 --> 23:49.216
* Bang, bang,
there goes your heart *

23:49.260 --> 23:50.454
* I know you want it

23:50.490 --> 23:51.787
( burglar alarm blaring )

23:51.830 --> 23:54.196
* Back, back seat of my car
I'll let you have it *

23:54.230 --> 23:57.495
* Wait a minute,
let me take you there *

23:57.530 --> 24:00.590
* Wait a minute 'til ya

24:00.640 --> 24:03.507
* Bang, bang,
bang, bang, ooh *

24:03.540 --> 24:07.135
* Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, ooh *

24:07.170 --> 24:08.728
* Bang, bang, bang...

24:08.780 --> 24:10.099
That's it.

24:10.140 --> 24:13.610
Last one.
Come on, come on.

24:13.650 --> 24:16.813
* BtotheAtotheN
to the G to the uh *

24:16.850 --> 24:21.082
* BtotheAtotheN
to the G to the uh *

24:21.120 --> 24:24.556
* Baby, baby,
baby, baby... *

24:39.740 --> 24:42.971
Toby, what are you doing?

24:46.010 --> 24:47.238
Is this your van?

24:47.280 --> 24:48.645
Yep, that's my painting
in the seat.

24:48.680 --> 24:49.749
Jonny!

24:49.780 --> 24:50.644
I've got the rest
in the back.

24:50.690 --> 24:54.786
He was just
taking back what was his.

25:03.630 --> 25:05.120
Would you step back,
please?

25:05.170 --> 25:07.126
What are you doing?

25:07.170 --> 25:08.728
He didn't do
anything wrong.

25:08.770 --> 25:09.930
If you want
to question somebody

25:09.970 --> 25:12.063
you should be questioning
the creep who runs the gallery.

25:14.780 --> 25:15.701
Open this up for me.

25:15.740 --> 25:17.207
Toby--
No.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.549
Leave it alone, okay?
What are you even doing here?

25:19.580 --> 25:21.616
I'm doing my job.
Responding to a call.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.584
The question is,
what are you doing here?

25:23.620 --> 25:25.019
She didn't have anything
to do with this.

25:25.050 --> 25:26.540
You can let her go.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.854
That's not your call
to make.

25:28.890 --> 25:30.016
You need to come down
to the station with me.

25:30.060 --> 25:31.925
Please turn around and put
your hands behind your back.

25:31.960 --> 25:32.984
Toby, stop it!

25:33.030 --> 25:34.122
Spencer, it's okay.
I got this.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.559
No, it's not okay.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.919
He's only doing this
because he's mad at me.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.758
No, I'm doing this because
a business was burglarized

25:39.800 --> 25:41.859
and there are stolen goods
in the vehicle.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.709
Wait.
You cannot arrest him!

25:43.740 --> 25:45.298
What are you doing?

25:45.340 --> 25:48.002
Have you even heard a word
that I've been saying?

25:48.040 --> 25:51.168
Will you please just stop
being a cop for a minute?

25:51.210 --> 25:52.199
Toby!

25:54.320 --> 25:55.844
Just walk away, Spencer.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.916
No, I won't.
Will you please just talk to me?

25:57.950 --> 25:59.315
I can't do this here.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.250
Okay, when do you want
to talk about this?

26:01.290 --> 26:04.123
You're still
on Tanner's radar.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.788
She wants to take advantage
of my relationship to you.

26:06.830 --> 26:07.797
This isn't about Tanner.

26:07.830 --> 26:08.819
It is.

26:10.030 --> 26:12.794
Don't give her ammunition.
Just walk away.

26:14.870 --> 26:17.088
Walk away!

26:39.690 --> 26:43.251
( engine rewing )

27:32.050 --> 27:33.779
( panting )

27:41.320 --> 27:44.426
* I can give it to you
all the time *

27:44.460 --> 27:47.020
* She got a booty
like a Cadillac *

27:47.060 --> 27:49.722
* But I can send you
into overdrive *

27:51.030 --> 27:53.931
* You've been waiting
for that *

27:53.970 --> 27:57.189
* Stop, hold up,
swing your bat *

27:57.240 --> 27:59.800
* Just see anybody
could be bad to you *

27:59.840 --> 28:02.274
* You need a good girl
to blow your mind *

28:02.310 --> 28:03.208
* Yeah

28:03.240 --> 28:05.879
* Bang, bang
into the room *

28:05.910 --> 28:06.842
* I know you want it

28:06.880 --> 28:09.178
* Bang, bang
all over you *

28:09.220 --> 28:10.278
* I'll let you have it

28:10.320 --> 28:13.710
* Wait a minute,
let me take you there *

28:13.760 --> 28:16.354
* Wait a minute 'til ya

28:16.390 --> 28:18.779
* Bang, bang,
there goes your heart *

28:18.830 --> 28:19.728
* I know you want it

28:19.760 --> 28:21.352
* Back,
back seat of my car *

28:21.400 --> 28:22.890
* I'll let you have it

28:22.930 --> 28:26.127
* Wait a minute,
let me take you there *

28:26.170 --> 28:29.059
_ * Wait a
minute 'til ya *

28:29.100 --> 28:32.365
* Bang, bang,
bang, bang, ooh *

28:32.410 --> 28:35.504
* Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, ooh *

28:35.540 --> 28:38.941
* Bang, bang,
bang, bang, ooh *

28:38.980 --> 28:42.108
* Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, ooh *

28:42.150 --> 28:45.415
* B to the A to the
N to the G to the uh *

28:45.450 --> 28:48.419
* B to the A to the
N to the G to the uh *

28:48.460 --> 28:50.257
* B to the A to the
N to the G to the uh *

28:50.290 --> 28:52.053
* Baby, baby,
baby, baby *

28:52.090 --> 28:55.253
* B to the A to the
N to the G to the uh *

28:55.300 --> 28:57.427
* See anybody could be
good to you *

28:57.460 --> 29:00.258
* You need a bad girl
to blow your mind *

29:00.300 --> 29:01.767
* Your mind

29:02.870 --> 29:04.906
* Bang, bang
into the room *

29:04.940 --> 29:05.861
* I know you want it

29:05.910 --> 29:08.105
* Bang, bang
all over you *

29:08.140 --> 29:09.732
* I'll let you have it

29:15.850 --> 29:17.886
* Bang, bang,
there goes your heart *

29:17.920 --> 29:19.114
* I know you want it

29:19.150 --> 29:20.981
* Back,
back seat of my car *

29:21.020 --> 29:22.089
* I'll let you have it

29:22.120 --> 29:25.283
* Wait a minute,
let me take you there *

29:25.330 --> 29:27.252
* Wait a minute 'til ya

29:30.330 --> 29:32.161
( both panting )

29:34.570 --> 29:35.832
Well.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.935
That was revealing.

29:44.410 --> 29:45.479
Hanna”.

29:47.310 --> 29:48.948
The girls who take
this crown home

29:48.980 --> 29:51.016
all have one thing
in common.

29:52.020 --> 29:54.159
They have allure.

29:54.190 --> 29:55.214
Mystery.

29:56.420 --> 29:57.352
You, however,
need to learn

29:57.390 --> 30:00.029
to keep a secret
in this age of over-sharing.

30:00.060 --> 30:01.891
I have lots of secrets.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.454
Well, anger
isn't one of them.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.037
Look, I know that I messed up
on that one move, but--

30:08.070 --> 30:10.095
It's not about
the one move.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.028
It's. ..
the whole package,

30:13.140 --> 30:14.869
everything you're putting
out there.

30:14.910 --> 30:18.869
You're not _
pageant material.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.451
It was, um--
It's my fault.

30:28.490 --> 30:29.388
I picked the song.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.285
It doesn't show
what Hanna can really do.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.321
Oh, I think I've
seen more than enough

30:33.360 --> 30:35.191
of what Hanna
can really do.

30:35.230 --> 30:39.098
I'm sorry, this isn't
going to work for me.

30:53.650 --> 30:56.278
You know, that was a really
lousy thing for you to say.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.379
I'm doing her a favor,
dear.

30:58.420 --> 31:00.479
Taking her money
would be criminal.

31:00.520 --> 31:04.957
She'd only crash and burn
in a much more humiliating

31:04.990 --> 31:06.127
and public setting.

31:08.660 --> 31:11.493
She doesn't have what it takes
to go the distance.

31:11.530 --> 31:15.534
You, however, do.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.349
I only came here
to help a friend.

31:25.380 --> 31:27.439
That's very
generous of you.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.345
You know,
Hanna needs to win this.

31:29.380 --> 31:32.281
She might need it,
but she doesn't want it.

31:33.290 --> 31:34.882
There's a big difference.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.389
Hanna!

31:45.630 --> 31:46.995
Hanna, wait!

31:48.370 --> 31:50.065
Emily?

31:51.440 --> 31:53.431
What are you doing here?

31:53.470 --> 31:55.609
How did you know that I was--
Your mom told me.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.278
I got your message
from earlier

31:57.310 --> 31:59.278
and you sounded weird.

31:59.310 --> 32:01.540
What happened at the Brew
yesterday?

32:04.190 --> 32:05.543
Did Ezra find out
about us?

32:05.590 --> 32:07.148
No.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.482
But I met Eric.

32:10.520 --> 32:13.182
You told him
I was an experiment,

32:13.230 --> 32:14.424
a one-time thing.

32:14.460 --> 32:15.950
I didn't know
where this was going.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.251
It's going nowhere.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.427
I'm not into girls
because it's trendy.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.734
I don't think of you
that way.

32:21.770 --> 32:24.568
This relationship now
has three people in it, Talia.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.566
And you've been lying to
every one of them.

32:28.440 --> 32:31.409
Look, I need to go,
okay?

32:31.450 --> 32:33.202
I have a friend
who needs me right now.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.563
( rustling )

33:02.780 --> 33:05.146
( rustling )

33:14.660 --> 33:15.615
What're you doing here?

33:15.660 --> 33:17.685
Never mind
what I'm doing here.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.529
Why is this here?

33:19.560 --> 33:22.256
Mike, why are you stashing
my blood in the woods?

33:22.300 --> 33:23.289
It's not yours.

33:23.330 --> 33:24.297
Really?

33:24.330 --> 33:26.059
Whose is it?
Is it Spencer's?

33:26.100 --> 33:27.089
Is it Hanna's?

33:27.130 --> 33:28.131
Mona's.

33:29.370 --> 33:30.462
Now give it to me.

33:30.500 --> 33:31.467
( glass breaks )

33:31.510 --> 33:32.499
( panting )

34:00.730 --> 34:02.698
Didn't you hear me calling you
in front of the school?

34:02.740 --> 34:05.664
Hanna, that woman
is not a coach.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.132
She's a gorgon.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.172
I don't care how many
beauty pageants she's won,

34:09.210 --> 34:10.472
she's an ugly person.

34:11.810 --> 34:14.415
Hey, girls.
I didn't hear you come in.

34:14.450 --> 34:16.816
Hanna,
I spoke to your father.

34:16.850 --> 34:19.148
He doesn't know anything
about the pageant

34:19.190 --> 34:22.284
or how Kate could have
Signed up for that room.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.481
She's not even in Pennsylvania
this weekend.

34:24.530 --> 34:25.554
What?

34:25.590 --> 34:27.421
Doesn't matter anyway.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.519
Thinking I could do
this was asinine.

34:29.560 --> 34:30.527
Says who?

34:30.560 --> 34:31.561
My coach.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.262
Who would rather be
your coach.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.671
I'm gonna go
take my shower.

34:43.740 --> 34:45.446
Did you stick
around long enough

34:45.480 --> 34:48.210
to hear what happened
after she said that?

34:48.250 --> 34:50.377
I told her off, Hanna.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.183
She had no right--
( cell phone beeps )

34:54.360 --> 34:55.418
Who's that from?

35:01.260 --> 35:02.249
Oh, my God.

35:02.300 --> 35:05.224
Did "A" put Kate's name
on the sign-up sheet?

35:05.270 --> 35:07.329
"A" is sitting in jail,
Emily.

35:07.370 --> 35:09.565
Mike did this.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.329
And Alison's gonna use
whoever she can

35:11.370 --> 35:12.860
to keep us here
forever.

35:12.910 --> 35:14.468
And guess what?

35:14.510 --> 35:15.670
It worked.

35:15.710 --> 35:17.530
I'm not doing
that pageant.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.275
Well, I am.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.116
For you.

35:22.150 --> 35:24.880
I know how much
you need that money,

35:24.920 --> 35:27.184
and I swear, I will win
that prize for you.

35:27.220 --> 35:28.756
Emily, stop.

35:28.790 --> 35:30.417
"A" is just gonna
come after you, too.

35:30.460 --> 35:35.397
"A" can come after me
any day of the week, anywhere.

35:36.660 --> 35:39.128
That's not going to stop me
from helping someone I love.

35:46.940 --> 35:48.578
( knock on door)

35:50.240 --> 35:51.241
Hey.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.076
Why didn't you call me?

35:52.110 --> 35:53.475
Did my mom come down
to the station?

35:53.510 --> 35:54.477
She did.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.647
And posted my bail.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.489
Okay.
Okay, you'll pay her back.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.612
I already have.

35:59.650 --> 36:01.481
She took it out of the security
deposit for the lease

36:01.520 --> 36:04.557
which expired about
20 minutes ago.

36:05.660 --> 36:07.719
She's not
kicking you out.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.524
I believe the words she used
were "effective now."

36:11.670 --> 36:13.524
Is there room
for interpretation?

36:15.670 --> 36:16.932
Do you guys have
any packing tape?

36:20.710 --> 36:22.439
It's that scumbag
from the gallery

36:22.480 --> 36:24.345
who should be punished,
not you.

36:26.980 --> 36:29.847
I don't think Officer Toby
was in a calling mood.

36:31.750 --> 36:33.786
I'm really sorry.

36:33.820 --> 36:35.458
I...

36:35.490 --> 36:37.378
_I can't believe that
he just acted like such a--

36:37.420 --> 36:38.626
Such a what?

36:38.660 --> 36:40.423
An over zealous cop?

36:41.430 --> 36:42.829
Over zealous boyfriend?

36:49.470 --> 36:50.732
Where are you gonna go?

36:52.610 --> 36:53.668
Who knows?

36:55.280 --> 36:56.838
Maybe I'll live in my car
for a while.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.475
I've got some cool art
to hang on the walls.

37:06.290 --> 37:07.609
Wait.

37:10.060 --> 37:11.459
Take this, too.

37:35.980 --> 37:37.311
Dad!

37:37.350 --> 37:39.409
Dad, are you here?

37:39.450 --> 37:40.519
Dad!

37:41.520 --> 37:42.316
Stay away from me!

37:42.360 --> 37:43.782
Do you hear me?
Aria, listen to me.

37:43.820 --> 37:45.048
No, I swear to God
I'll call the police.

37:45.090 --> 37:46.557
Just listen, okay!

37:46.590 --> 37:47.625
I can explain.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.920
Do you want to know
what happened to Mona or not?

37:52.670 --> 37:55.468
I know what you're thinking,
but I didn't hurt her.

37:56.800 --> 37:57.960
A few nights before
Thanksgiving,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.036
I went to Mona's house
and I...

38:00.070 --> 38:02.538
I surprised her.

38:02.580 --> 38:03.933
When did he get the axe?

38:04.980 --> 38:06.572
I can't keep up
with you, Lesli.

38:06.610 --> 38:08.043
I swear we're gonna need
the entire weekend

38:08.080 --> 38:09.513
just to catch up.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.547
Oh, come on, Lesli,
just try.

38:12.590 --> 38:13.841
Please.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.788
( door closing )
Mona?

38:20.830 --> 38:22.457
Lesli, I have to
call you back.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.029
What is all that?

38:30.570 --> 38:31.764
What is this?

38:31.810 --> 38:33.607
What_the hell
is gomg on?

38:33.640 --> 38:34.902
Don't touch that, okay?

38:34.940 --> 38:36.703
Just leave it alone
and I'll explain.

38:40.710 --> 38:41.677
What are you doing?

38:41.720 --> 38:44.348
I've been offered a chance
to make things right

38:44.390 --> 38:45.539
for your sister
and her friends.

38:45.590 --> 38:46.989
Mona, what are you
talking about?

38:47.020 --> 38:48.715
I'm talking about
exposing "A"

38:48.760 --> 38:50.955
and finally bringing
that person down.

38:53.960 --> 38:55.359
Is that your blood?

38:55.400 --> 38:56.526
Yes.

38:56.560 --> 38:59.961
And soon it's going to be
smeared all over this house.

39:01.470 --> 39:03.597
And Alison DiLaurent_is is
gonna look respon5ible

39:03.640 --> 39:04.834
for killing me.

39:04.870 --> 39:07.031
Because "A" wants to
see her locked up.

39:07.070 --> 39:09.834
Why would you want to be
involved in all this?

39:09.880 --> 39:11.643
Because "A" came up
with this plan, Mike,

39:11.680 --> 39:12.669
and it's brilliant.

39:12.710 --> 39:13.677
Wait, wait, wait.

39:13.710 --> 39:14.711
Stop.

39:14.750 --> 39:15.978
You've been
talking to "A"?

39:16.020 --> 39:17.669
Not directly.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.779
But I will
eventually.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.583
I have to earn it.

39:21.620 --> 39:25.454
And to do that, I have to
commit to this 100%.

39:25.490 --> 39:26.422
That means I go away.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.997
And when I find out
who "A" is, I come back.

39:29.030 --> 39:30.054
Alison gets out of jail

39:30.100 --> 39:33.092
and your sister and her friends
are finally safe.

39:33.130 --> 39:34.461
And I'm everyone's hero.

39:36.170 --> 39:37.569
What do you mean
"go away"?

39:38.810 --> 39:40.004
For how long?

39:40.040 --> 39:42.406
You have to look
at the big picture, Mike.

39:42.440 --> 39:43.805
It's only temporary.

39:44.950 --> 39:48.738
Mike, if what
you're telling me is true--

39:48.780 --> 39:50.111
It is.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.784
I swear.

39:54.660 --> 39:57.982
We fought about this for days
and she convinced me

39:58.020 --> 40:00.386
that she had it
all under control,

40:01.900 --> 40:03.026
that she would be safe.

40:06.670 --> 40:08.092
I don't believe that
anymore.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.998
Is this why you've been
visiting Alison in jail?

40:14.040 --> 40:16.031
You told her
Mona's plan?

40:16.080 --> 40:18.503
Mona and I were supposed
to meet a bunch of times.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.869
But she's never
shown up.

40:21.620 --> 40:22.609
I only went there
to find out

40:22.650 --> 40:24.174
if she knew
anything about "A".

40:24.220 --> 40:27.439
Because you think that
"A" double-crossed Mona

40:27.490 --> 40:28.650
and killed her.

40:32.690 --> 40:35.022
But why are you so sure
that Alison isn't "A"?

40:35.060 --> 40:35.924
She can't be.

40:37.860 --> 40:39.964
Alison wasn't even here
when it happened.

40:41.500 --> 40:42.933
Cyrus told me
that "A" had him

40:42.970 --> 40:44.961
get Alison out of town
that day.

40:46.570 --> 40:48.731
Mike, why do you have
Mona's blood?

40:50.980 --> 40:52.208
She gave it to me...

40:54.180 --> 40:56.614
as a promise that
she would be coming back.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.584
I wasn't hiding it in that tree
because I hurt her.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.588
I was hiding it because
I didn't want you to find it

41:03.620 --> 41:04.985
and ask questions.

41:08.060 --> 41:10.119
That was all
I had left of her.

41:25.750 --> 41:27.809
EMILY: So that necklace
was for Mona?

41:27.850 --> 41:29.715
Mike was holding onto
any grain of hope,

41:29.750 --> 41:31.115
but not anymore.

41:31.150 --> 41:32.708
He realizes
she's really dead.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.752
I guess your brother
didn't realize

41:34.790 --> 41:36.109
how vicious
"A" can be.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.185
I can't believe your brother
knows about "A" at all.

41:38.220 --> 41:41.724
If Mona told Mike,
she must've really trusted him.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.058
More than I did.

41:50.140 --> 41:51.869
So what now?

41:51.910 --> 41:53.104
Do we tell Alison?

41:53.140 --> 41:54.300
How can we?

41:54.340 --> 41:56.274
We've destroyed
a lot of evidence

41:56.310 --> 41:58.130
that could've proved that
she was innocent.

41:58.180 --> 41:59.545
And basically
made a barricade

41:59.580 --> 42:01.207
so the police had to
throw her behind bars.

42:01.250 --> 42:03.218
Well, are we gonna say
anything before her trial?

42:03.250 --> 42:04.581
We have to.

42:04.620 --> 42:06.611
We accused her
of being "A".

42:06.650 --> 42:07.810
To her face.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.187
How do we
take that back?
