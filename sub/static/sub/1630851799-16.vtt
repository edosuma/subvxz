08:20.167 --> 08:22.626
- So funny, right?
Our little drive-by.

08:22.626 --> 08:24.501
- A little drive-by
with spaghetti sauce.

08:24.501 --> 08:27.501
- Garcelle expressed how much
she loved Harry's sauce.

08:27.501 --> 08:30.417
- This was so yummy.
- You want another bowl of it?

08:30.417 --> 08:32.209
- I want to take it home.
- Okay.

08:32.209 --> 08:33.959
- So I can eat when
no one's really looking at me.

08:33.959 --> 08:35.918
- I know.
- And so, the next day,

08:35.918 --> 08:38.209
we drove up
to Garcelle's house.

08:38.209 --> 08:39.375
- It was so good.
- It's so good.

08:39.375 --> 08:40.584
He's such a great cook,
isn't he?

08:40.584 --> 08:41.501
- Yeah, he really is.

08:41.501 --> 08:43.250
Thank you for this.
- You're so welcome.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.417
And we dropped off
his sauce for her.

08:45.417 --> 08:46.834
- I'm actually
gonna make some coffee

08:46.834 --> 08:48.334
because I haven't had any.
- Okay. Good.

08:48.334 --> 08:49.334
- Do you want coffee too?
- Yeah.

08:49.334 --> 08:51.250
I didn't get a whole lot
of sleep last night.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.501
That was a late night.
- So what's your takeaway?

08:53.501 --> 08:55.083
- Well, I need you
to fill me in

08:55.083 --> 08:57.667
because drunk Rinna
was in full swing.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.417
- Were you?
- Oh, yeah.

08:59.417 --> 09:01.083
- Champagne, or white wine?

09:01.083 --> 09:04.417
- Ooh, I'd like
some white wine.

09:04.417 --> 09:06.375
This is now my second drink.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.584
- [chanting]
We love drunk Rinna.

09:08.584 --> 09:10.042
We love drunk Rinna.

09:10.042 --> 09:11.918
- [cackles]
I've never had a bell.

09:11.918 --> 09:15.459
- I'm not sure drunk Rinna
should have a bell, though.

09:15.459 --> 09:17.417
[laughter]

09:17.417 --> 09:19.042
- You were ringing the bell,
going, "Own it.

09:19.042 --> 09:21.042
Everybody own it.
Everybody be truthful,"

09:21.042 --> 09:23.292
and I was like,
"Oh, here we go."

09:23.292 --> 09:26.000
- Oh, my God.
That's actually really funny.

09:26.000 --> 09:26.959
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

09:26.959 --> 09:30.501
I remember Erika and Sutton
having words,

09:30.501 --> 09:32.584
but I was full-on drunk
at that party.

09:32.584 --> 09:35.751
With a bell.
[laughs]

09:35.751 --> 09:38.125
- Erika lost her sh--.

09:38.125 --> 09:39.542
She threatened her.
- Oh, sh--.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.125
- And when Sutton goes,
"Is that a threat?"

09:41.125 --> 09:43.125
And she was like,
"No. It's a promise."

09:43.125 --> 09:45.417
- [gasps]
- Like, full-on.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.501
- Oh, my gosh.
So it was bad.

09:47.501 --> 09:49.542
- It was bad. We can go
sit over there, if you want.

09:49.542 --> 09:50.918
- Oh.
- It was bad.

09:50.918 --> 09:54.417
And Sutton got up.
She started crying.

09:54.417 --> 09:57.042
- Oh, I didn't see that either.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

09:57.042 --> 09:59.375
Kathy kept on saying,
"Can we do this after coffee?

09:59.375 --> 10:00.834
Can we do this after dinner?"

10:00.834 --> 10:04.167
Which I'm going to heed
the warning next week.

10:04.167 --> 10:06.834
I'm having a Haitian dinner
that I'm inviting you guys to,

10:06.834 --> 10:08.751
and, um--

10:08.751 --> 10:11.459
But I think
the more we're together,

10:11.459 --> 10:13.167
we just have to figure it out,
you know?

10:13.167 --> 10:15.083
- It's not easy.
- No, it's not easy.

10:15.083 --> 10:16.334
- It's not easy.

10:16.334 --> 10:17.709
- I checked on Sutton
this morning,

10:17.709 --> 10:19.542
and I just sent her a text
saying, "Are you okay?"

10:19.542 --> 10:20.834
And she said,
"No, I'm not okay."

10:20.834 --> 10:22.000
- Aw.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.042
- I don't know if she wants
to be alone with Erika.

10:24.042 --> 10:26.709
She feels like
Erika threatened her.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.792
- It's up to them now
to figure that out.

10:28.792 --> 10:29.792
- Yeah.

10:29.792 --> 10:32.792
- It sounds like
it was horrible.

10:32.792 --> 10:34.125
- I feel like,
and I'm gonna say this,

10:34.125 --> 10:36.626
I feel like the four of you
were together,

10:36.626 --> 10:39.209
and then me and Crystal
and Sutton are

10:39.209 --> 10:40.417
on the other side
of everything.

10:40.417 --> 10:41.709
- Why? Do you really?
- I do.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.250
I do, and I've said it
a couple of times.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.375
I just feel like you guys
look out for each other,

10:45.375 --> 10:48.959
but I don't feel like--I don't
feel like you look out for me.

10:48.959 --> 10:50.918
- Really?
- Yes.

10:50.918 --> 10:53.542
- Oh, gosh.
I'm sorry you feel that.

10:53.542 --> 10:57.250
I really don't feel that way.
- Really?

10:57.250 --> 10:58.334
- I really don't.
I think I've made--

10:58.334 --> 11:01.083
- When we were in La Quinta
and I asked Erika

11:01.083 --> 11:08.751
that question that set her off,
you totally took Erika's side.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.250
- I'm leaving.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.751
- You're leaving?
- I'm going.

11:11.751 --> 11:15.375
At your launch party,
Dorit was saying things at me.

(BLEEP) you. (BLEEP) you.
- Oh, are you going?

11:18.125 --> 11:22.125
Is that the easy way,
or do you want to talk it out?

11:22.125 --> 11:23.959
- You didn't say anything.

11:23.959 --> 11:26.125
- Well, it wasn't my place
to say anything in that moment.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.834
- Rinna, come on.
You're--

11:27.834 --> 11:29.709
Then it's never your place
to say anything,

11:29.709 --> 11:31.375
but you always say stuff.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.042
- My loyalty is to the truth,

11:34.042 --> 11:35.667
how I see the truth.

11:35.667 --> 11:39.250
And what Dorit was saying,
I didn't disagree with it.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.751
I--I heard the jabs.

11:40.751 --> 11:42.083
And yet, you expect me
to, like,

11:42.083 --> 11:45.083
step in and fight your battles?

11:45.083 --> 11:46.834
Bitch, please.

11:46.834 --> 11:49.042
I choose not to nitpick
with you.

And maybe you're choosing
to nitpick with me a bit,

11:51.042 --> 11:53.918

So if we're gonna go there,

11:53.918 --> 11:55.167
then I'm gonna go here
with you.

11:55.167 --> 11:56.250

to hear this story.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.375
- Just wondering if it's
gonna go through dessert.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.667
[laughter]

33:31.667 --> 33:33.334
- Anyways,

33:33.334 --> 33:36.000
Garcelle, I love the flowers.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.375
And forgive my ignorance,

33:37.375 --> 33:39.584
but are they, like, a flower
that's typical in Haiti?

33:39.584 --> 33:41.292
- No. I wanted to do something

33:41.292 --> 33:43.375
to sort of bring us
to a tropical vibe.

33:43.375 --> 33:44.626
- Those are orchids.

33:44.626 --> 33:46.459
[dramatic musical sting]

33:46.459 --> 33:49.667
- I'm not talking about
the orchids, you (BLEEP).

33:49.667 --> 33:53.459
[tense music]

33:53.459 --> 33:55.501
- Oh, wow.
- Come on.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.292
[clinks glass]
- Sispann pale.

33:57.292 --> 33:58.709
Sispann pale.
Sispann pale.
Okay.

33:58.709 --> 34:00.125
- "Sispann pale"?

34:00.125 --> 34:01.667
- Sispann pale.
"Stop talking."

34:01.667 --> 34:04.375
Why am I looking at you, Dorit?
- Yeah, well--

34:04.375 --> 34:06.042
How many languages
you want to tell me

34:06.042 --> 34:07.083
to shut up in?

34:07.083 --> 34:09.250
[laughter]

34:09.250 --> 34:12.334
- Have Dorit and I
buried things? No.

34:12.334 --> 34:16.667
I think we just hit pause
for a moment, but we'll see.

34:16.667 --> 34:19.250
- Our next dish is
bolas de morue,

34:19.250 --> 34:22.459
which is codfish balls.

34:22.459 --> 34:25.083
When we didn't have
refrigeration,

34:25.083 --> 34:28.125
we really relied
on salting fish

34:28.125 --> 34:30.250
so it can last and sustain us,

34:30.250 --> 34:32.918
so this is a dish that really
means a lot to us as well.

34:32.918 --> 34:34.959
Enjoy.
- Yummy!

34:34.959 --> 34:37.167
- Don't even act like that
doesn't look like a wiener.

34:37.167 --> 34:39.125
It does.
- Weiner?

34:39.125 --> 34:43.042
- Oh, yes!
That is phallic-y.

34:43.042 --> 34:44.959
- Is this like
the tartar sauce?

34:44.959 --> 34:47.918
- This?

34:47.918 --> 34:50.000
- The food is not
what I'm used to.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.751
But because it's Garcelle
and her heritage,

34:52.751 --> 34:55.209
I'm making a real,
like, effort,

34:55.209 --> 34:57.125
and I'm gonna just eat it.

34:57.125 --> 35:00.959
I'm gonna eat it.

35:00.959 --> 35:02.626
I did it.
I ate fish.

35:02.626 --> 35:04.584
I did it.

35:04.584 --> 35:09.667
[crunch]
I did it.

35:09.667 --> 35:11.751
- This is lambi,

35:11.751 --> 35:15.042
which is conch with djon-djon,

35:15.042 --> 35:17.167
which is a mushroom black rice.

35:17.167 --> 35:18.959
- All right.
- Oh.

35:18.959 --> 35:21.626
- So bon appétit.
- What is conch?

35:21.626 --> 35:23.167
- It's kind of like--
- A snail.

35:23.167 --> 35:26.000
A sea snail.
- Yeah.

35:26.000 --> 35:26.834
It's the Haitian way.

35:26.834 --> 35:30.626
You don't know what you're
gonna see in the kitchen.

35:30.626 --> 35:31.959
- [quietly]
I'm not gonna eat snail.

35:31.959 --> 35:33.876
- Growing up
as a Haitian child,

35:33.876 --> 35:36.042
the only Black kid
in the whole school,

35:36.042 --> 35:39.167
I invite a friend over
who I'm excited about,

35:39.167 --> 35:40.876
my first American friend.

35:40.876 --> 35:41.834
- Ooh, I love it.

35:41.834 --> 35:43.626
- And I walk into our kitchen,

35:43.626 --> 35:47.334
and there's a dead goat's head
in the sink.

35:47.334 --> 35:49.042
- It's good.

35:49.042 --> 35:55.626
- My little white friend
was out the door.

35:55.626 --> 35:57.083
- What's that noi--
Oh, wow.

35:57.083 --> 35:58.959
Something exciting is
going on over there.

35:58.959 --> 36:01.667
- It sounds like crème brûlée.
- Lavender crème brûlée.

36:01.667 --> 36:03.125
- Yum.
- Oh, gorgeous.

36:03.125 --> 36:05.000
- It's not a Haitian dessert.
- Oh, it's not?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
- No.
- Okay.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.042
- But it's pretty.

36:07.042 --> 36:09.083
- Everything has been
so delicious. Thank you.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.542
- Yeah, it really has.
Thank you so much.

36:10.542 --> 36:12.959
- Really. Really.
- Yeah, lovely.

36:12.959 --> 36:15.042
- I ate everything of this.
- Yeah, you did.

36:15.042 --> 36:17.292
- I did. I ate everything.
- I love that.

36:17.292 --> 36:18.667
That means a lot.
- Delicious.

36:18.667 --> 36:19.959
- Are you feeling this?

36:19.959 --> 36:21.501
- I was just--
it's so interesting.

36:21.501 --> 36:23.292
There's, like--
it's, like, jewels.

36:23.292 --> 36:24.959
Like, mine is like
fake sparkles.

36:24.959 --> 36:26.959
Yours is like real jewels.

36:26.959 --> 36:29.959
- Lisa, we've had
this conversation many times.

36:29.959 --> 36:31.334
- Are we going down
the couture route?

36:31.334 --> 36:32.834
- Do you want to go down
the couture route?

36:32.834 --> 36:33.918
- No, I don't.

36:33.918 --> 36:36.334
- This one gets
very competitive when shopping.

36:36.334 --> 36:37.918
- I think you're the same.

36:37.918 --> 36:38.834
- Yeah, I am.
- Oh, okay.

36:38.834 --> 36:41.459
- She was a little nasty
to me at Bonhams.

36:41.459 --> 36:43.876
She said I was talking
to "my friend," about me,

36:43.876 --> 36:45.334
and used these marks about me.

36:45.334 --> 36:47.792
- She did not do air italics.

36:47.792 --> 36:49.918
- I talk about it
with a "friend."

36:49.918 --> 36:51.292
- She said, "My friend."

36:51.292 --> 36:53.918
- I called her "my friend."
- Kyle?

36:53.918 --> 36:56.167
- Yeah, I did,
and I'm sorry for that.

36:56.167 --> 36:57.083
You're my real friend,

36:57.083 --> 37:01.167
and I believe that 100%
and totally. I do.

37:01.167 --> 37:03.083
- Well, I'm here for Garcelle,

37:03.083 --> 37:06.375
so I really don't care
about anybody's "friendship."

37:06.375 --> 37:08.584
I'm scrolling
"The New York Times,"

37:08.584 --> 37:10.000
and it's more interesting.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.292
- I apologize for that,

37:11.292 --> 37:13.834
because it was offensive
and it was hurtful,

37:13.834 --> 37:15.751
and then we bought jewelry,
so it was all fine.

37:15.751 --> 37:17.459
But really, I'm sorry.

37:17.459 --> 37:19.834
- I appreciate that.
Thank you.

37:19.834 --> 37:21.876
- I'm glad you're "here."

37:21.876 --> 37:23.042
[laughter]

37:23.042 --> 37:25.918
- You were a little bit
of an asshole,

37:25.918 --> 37:27.417
and--but, you know.

37:27.417 --> 37:30.209
I forgot to do this.
[laughter]

37:30.209 --> 37:32.209
- God.

37:32.209 --> 37:33.334
- Coming up...

37:33.334 --> 37:35.834
- You guys aren't friends.
[dramatic musical sting]

37:35.834 --> 37:35.834
You hurt her, she hurt you,
and it's, like, over.

37:35.834 --> 37:41.042
[lively music]

37:41.042 --> 37:43.667
[upbeat music]

37:43.667 --> 37:45.083
- Should we move
to the living room?

37:45.083 --> 37:46.876
- Sure.
- This was so nice.

37:46.876 --> 37:48.167
This was a great dinner,
Garcelle.

37:48.167 --> 37:50.751
- I loved it.
- Loved it. Loved it.

37:50.751 --> 37:52.292
- It's cold.
Oh, my God.

37:52.292 --> 37:54.876
It is cold, guys.
Jiminy Cricket.

37:54.876 --> 37:56.292
- Why don't you just
pop the heater on?

37:56.292 --> 37:57.959
- The heat is on.
- Oh, it is. [laughs]

37:57.959 --> 37:59.751
- Should I pass out blankets?

37:59.751 --> 38:01.501
- Is Erika here?

38:01.501 --> 38:03.542
- There's no assigned seats.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.292
- Everybody here is
aware of the fact

38:05.292 --> 38:08.375
that Sutton and Erika
are not speaking.

38:08.375 --> 38:12.000
It is just as awkward for them
as everyone around them.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.334
- So who wants coats?
I'm passing out coats.

38:14.334 --> 38:15.751
- Coats?

38:15.751 --> 38:17.834
- That is so cute.
Here. We'll go like this.

38:17.834 --> 38:20.167
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.
Perfect.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.584
Oh, look at that cute coat.

38:21.584 --> 38:23.375
That matches you.
- I love it.

38:23.375 --> 38:25.501
- I love our party favors.
[laughter]

38:25.501 --> 38:27.250
- Isn't that cute?
- I'm always cold.

38:27.250 --> 38:29.167
- Well, you always wear
beautiful, bright colors.

38:29.167 --> 38:31.334
- Yeah, we were talking
about bright colors. Yeah.

38:31.334 --> 38:33.209
- Me too.
- I try to also.

38:33.209 --> 38:35.501
- I love the yellow Gucci pants
you wore.

38:35.501 --> 38:36.959
I've been trying to find them.
- Yeah.

38:36.959 --> 38:38.083
- Oh, I love those.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.834
- Those were good pants.

38:39.834 --> 38:42.000
- Oh, you weren't there.
You weren't invited.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.918
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, you look so pretty.

38:45.918 --> 38:47.626
I love your pants.

38:47.626 --> 38:51.000
- Oh, damn. We shouldn't
have brought that up.

38:51.000 --> 38:51.959
- You weren't invited
that night.

38:51.959 --> 38:54.209
Sorry. You weren't.
- What night was that?

38:54.209 --> 38:56.751
- She--we just--
- Well...

38:56.751 --> 38:58.209
- I don't remember
when I wore that.

38:58.209 --> 39:02.042
- So do you feel like
you've been told the truth?

39:02.042 --> 39:03.042
- No.

39:03.042 --> 39:04.209
- That's okay.

39:04.209 --> 39:06.834
- I didn't bring it up.
- Well, that makes it more--

39:06.834 --> 39:08.709
It's just the night that
we went to Dorit's house.

39:08.709 --> 39:10.417
- Yes, it's the night
we went to Dorit's house

39:10.417 --> 39:14.042
and you weren't there.

39:14.042 --> 39:15.709
- I am gonna dip out because--
- As you should.

39:15.709 --> 39:16.709
- Yeah, I know.

39:16.709 --> 39:17.959
- Me too.
I'm gonna go with you.

39:17.959 --> 39:19.501
- Yeah, you know what?
I think I might too.

39:19.501 --> 39:20.959
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.334
- Thank you so much
for everything.

39:22.334 --> 39:23.834
- Oh, my pleasure.
Thank you for coming.

39:23.834 --> 39:25.125
You're so welcome.
- Oh, thank you.

39:25.125 --> 39:26.501
- Thank you
for a beautiful evening.

39:26.501 --> 39:27.918
- Aw, thank you.
- I really had a nice--

39:27.918 --> 39:29.584
Yeah, it was gorgeous,
and the food was great.

39:29.584 --> 39:30.876
- Aw, thank you.
- I had a lot of fun.

39:30.876 --> 39:32.125
- Get home safely, you guys.

39:32.125 --> 39:34.834
- Whoo! Boy, it's chilly.
Nippy-nippy.

39:34.834 --> 39:38.083
- That was lovely.
I had a great time.

39:38.083 --> 39:40.501
- Was that the first time
that you saw Erika?

39:40.501 --> 39:43.000
- Well, yeah. You think I've
seen her in the past five days?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.667
I don't have anything to say,
so I'm good.

39:45.667 --> 39:47.667
- You don't expect an apology?

39:47.667 --> 39:49.542
- I don't care
if I get an apology or not.

39:49.542 --> 39:51.250
- Okay.
- Here's the problem.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.918
She's expecting one.

39:52.918 --> 39:54.542
- She's expecting--
[laughs haughtily]

39:54.542 --> 39:57.209
If anybody deserves an apology,

39:57.209 --> 39:59.000
it's the victims!

39:59.000 --> 40:00.834
- Erika?
- For being called a liar.

40:00.834 --> 40:03.792
- Oh.
- And then, maybe me.

40:03.792 --> 40:05.542
She threatened me,

40:05.542 --> 40:07.292
with fangs out!

40:07.292 --> 40:09.751
I got pushed
into a conversation

40:09.751 --> 40:11.626
that I didn't want to have
at a dinner table--

40:11.626 --> 40:13.751
- I agree.
- With everybody involved.

40:13.751 --> 40:15.083
- The point is,
is we're trying to say,

40:15.083 --> 40:17.375
if you say something
and you put it out there,

40:17.375 --> 40:19.083
you've got to just be honest
in the moment.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.375
If you guys have a conversation
about me that is something

40:21.375 --> 40:24.334
like calling me a liar
or that questions my integrity,

40:24.334 --> 40:26.709
please say it to me.
I want to know that.

40:26.709 --> 40:28.667
You know what I mean?
Is that making sense?

40:28.667 --> 40:31.125
- It's making sense,
but it's triggering me, though.

40:31.125 --> 40:33.334
- About what?
- About you and I.

40:33.334 --> 40:35.459
Because you're saying, "If
you're gonna call me a liar,

40:35.459 --> 40:37.417
call it to my face.
Don't wait six months,"

40:37.417 --> 40:38.918
and that's what happened
between us.

40:38.918 --> 40:41.042
- You came to my charity event,

40:41.042 --> 40:43.876
raised your paddle
to donate $5,000

40:43.876 --> 40:45.667
to Children's Hospital
Los Angeles,

40:45.667 --> 40:47.375
and never paid.
- What?

40:47.375 --> 40:50.542
I would've rather you'd say,
"Um, hello, we still haven't

40:50.542 --> 40:52.292
gotten the check,"
but we don't have to go back.

40:52.292 --> 40:54.167
- I didn't do that.
That was Children's Hospital.

40:54.167 --> 40:55.167
- I know!
- I don't handle that.

40:55.167 --> 40:57.167
- You keep saying that,
but that's not okay.

40:57.167 --> 40:59.167
- I mean, you talk
about picking a lane?

40:59.167 --> 41:00.876
I thought we were okay,
Garcelle,

41:00.876 --> 41:03.292
but now you're
switching lanes again.

41:03.292 --> 41:05.334
I don't handle that.
I'm not the money collector.

41:05.334 --> 41:07.083
- I got it.
- So--and we're past that.

41:07.083 --> 41:08.834
- No, we're past that.
- And I appreciate that.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.042
And you handled that.
- You know what I am sick of?

41:11.042 --> 41:14.334
I am sick of being
in the hot seat.

41:14.334 --> 41:16.584
- Well, what do we do about
you guys moving forward now?

41:16.584 --> 41:19.125
Because you can't just not talk
at all ever again in the group.

41:19.125 --> 41:20.417
- Well--

41:20.417 --> 41:22.792
- What do you think, guys?
- I was with her.

41:22.792 --> 41:24.167
There's no moving forward
for her.

41:24.167 --> 41:25.125
- Erika?
- Yeah.

41:25.125 --> 41:28.000
- Calling me a liar is like,
"Oh, hell no."

41:28.000 --> 41:29.042
- What if
she approaches you again?

41:29.042 --> 41:31.542
- There's nothing new to say.
- Right. Right.

41:31.542 --> 41:33.792
- And there's no apology
coming out of my mouth ever

41:33.792 --> 41:35.626
about anything that I said
at that table.

41:35.626 --> 41:37.000
- She said that?
- To me.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.542
- About Sutton?
- Yes. About Sutton.

41:38.542 --> 41:41.250
There's no path
to resolution with them.

41:41.250 --> 41:42.417
- Since Kathy's dinner?

41:42.417 --> 41:44.584
- Since Kathy's dinner,
when you called her a liar.

41:44.584 --> 41:47.083
There's no path.
- So you think just pretend?

41:47.083 --> 41:49.000
Like, the two of them, like,
just ignore each other

41:49.000 --> 41:50.751
in the group?
- There's no one pretending.

41:50.751 --> 41:51.876
They're not pretending
to be friends.

41:51.876 --> 41:54.751
They're just acting cordial.
That's what people do.

41:54.751 --> 41:57.375
- That was not
two people being cordial.

41:57.375 --> 42:01.000
That was being rude
and icing each other out,

42:01.000 --> 42:05.042
and that is uncomfortable
for everybody around them.

42:05.042 --> 42:06.709
But, like, if two people
aren't even talking,

42:06.709 --> 42:07.876
I'm just curious
if they have a plan.

42:07.876 --> 42:10.083
- That's fine. You sit at
the other ends of the table,

42:10.083 --> 42:12.083
and they don't have to talk,
and that's how people act.

42:12.083 --> 42:16.042
No one has to hang out and be,
like, phony and whatever.

42:16.042 --> 42:18.292
That's such BS. I hate that.

42:18.292 --> 42:19.667
- Well, I hate that too.

42:19.667 --> 42:21.417
But I can tell you that,
for me, personally,

42:21.417 --> 42:24.083
if I'm at a small, intimate
dinner with seven women

42:24.083 --> 42:25.626
and I know that two of us
aren't speaking,

42:25.626 --> 42:28.167
I'd feel like, "How do I
fix this moving forward,

42:28.167 --> 42:30.250
even if it's just
putting a Band-Aid?"

42:30.250 --> 42:31.542
Like, I don't know.

42:31.542 --> 42:35.834
- They don't need a and-Aid.
- No, I don't need a Band-Aid.

42:35.834 --> 42:38.209
- I think she's said plenty.

42:38.209 --> 42:40.000
I think Erika has heard plenty.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.542
And no one needs to push people
just to cause more pain.

42:43.542 --> 42:45.709
It's just
absolutely unnecessary.

42:45.709 --> 42:49.334
- So let it be.
- You guys aren't friends.

42:49.334 --> 42:51.626
You hurt her, she hurt you,
and it's, like, over.

42:51.626 --> 42:53.501
- If you're good with that
and she's okay with that,

42:53.501 --> 42:59.501
then let it go.
And it is what it is.

42:59.501 --> 43:01.083
Anyway, this was
a really beautiful night.

43:01.083 --> 43:04.000
[laughter]
It really was.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.083
- Next time

43:05.083 --> 43:07.083
on "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"...

43:07.083 --> 43:09.125
[all howling]

43:09.125 --> 43:11.209
- Sue and I communicate
with each other.

43:11.209 --> 43:12.959
[howls]

43:12.959 --> 43:15.209
- So I'm not the only crazy one
in this group.

43:15.209 --> 43:17.584
- There's actually a guy
that I'm going to show to you.

43:17.584 --> 43:18.834
- (BLEEP)!
[laughter]

43:18.834 --> 43:19.834
I see abs,

43:19.834 --> 43:23.000
and then I hear my bed springs
making noise.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.209
He's hot.

43:24.209 --> 43:25.417
- Tom's house was broken in to,

43:25.417 --> 43:26.792
and he confronted the burglar,

43:26.792 --> 43:28.584
and then had to go
have eye surgery.

43:28.584 --> 43:30.459
And then, my son had
to go over and help.

43:30.459 --> 43:32.209
- Recently?
- And then he rolled his car

43:32.209 --> 43:33.375
five times on the way home.

43:33.375 --> 43:34.626
Yeah, I'm under
a lot of stress.

43:34.626 --> 43:35.626
- Wait, what?

43:35.626 --> 43:37.000
- What you're suggesting then

43:37.000 --> 43:38.584
is that Erika's
not telling the truth.

43:38.584 --> 43:41.209
- No, I'm suggesting she's
been in a controlling marriage

43:41.209 --> 43:42.292
for 20 years,

43:42.292 --> 43:44.000
and she's still
being controlled.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.125
- There's lies
all over the place.

43:47.125 --> 43:49.167
- You had everyone up
in arms today.

43:49.167 --> 43:50.167
- About what?
What'd I do?

43:50.167 --> 43:53.042
- You said that
we're all coming after you.

43:53.042 --> 43:54.876
- I speak four languages.
- Good for you.

43:54.876 --> 43:57.167
- And that doesn't make sense
in any one of them.

43:57.167 --> 44:01.167
- My God, will you shut up?
