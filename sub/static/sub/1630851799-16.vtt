- Previously on

00:02.125 --> 00:03.751
"The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"...

00:03.751 --> 00:05.375
- Va-voom. Va-voom. Va-voom.

00:05.375 --> 00:06.501
Hi.

00:06.501 --> 00:07.792
- Oh, honey,
that's off the chain.

00:07.792 --> 00:09.542
- The last couple of months,

00:09.542 --> 00:11.542
you've been making
a lot of jabs at me.

00:11.542 --> 00:13.042
I want to know,
what is going on?

00:13.042 --> 00:15.792
- I don't know where I sit
honestly with this group.

00:15.792 --> 00:18.709
In a way, I feel like
an outsider a little bit.

00:18.709 --> 00:19.792
- Do you not believe Erika?

00:19.792 --> 00:21.834
- I think she has lied to us.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.167
- You do?
- I do.

00:23.167 --> 00:28.292
I definitely am ready for a
hardcore conversation with her.

00:28.292 --> 00:30.292
I'm not buying it.

00:30.292 --> 00:32.959
- I'm sorry, Sutton,
but you're not being honest,

00:32.959 --> 00:35.417
and you're putting us
in a bad position.

00:35.417 --> 00:38.083
- You trying to accuse me
of lying.

00:38.083 --> 00:40.125
Look at me. I'll go head-on
with you all ----ing day.

00:40.125 --> 00:41.501
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Or what?

00:41.501 --> 00:45.250
- Seriously.
- Or what?

00:45.250 --> 00:47.334
Shut the (BLEEP) up.

00:47.334 --> 00:50.375
You have no idea what
you're talking about. Nothing!

00:50.375 --> 00:53.292
- Everybody wants me
to be very honest with you

00:53.292 --> 00:55.334
and transparent,
so I'm trying to do that.

00:55.334 --> 00:56.876
- Would you like to get sued?

00:56.876 --> 00:59.375
[dramatic musical sting]

00:59.375 --> 01:00.209
- No.

01:00.209 --> 01:02.584
- Would you like to?
- Of course not.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.584
- Can I just say something?

01:04.584 --> 01:06.751
When you say things like,
"Do you want to get sued?"

01:06.751 --> 01:09.876
that actually gives credence
to what she was worried about.

01:09.876 --> 01:11.751
- Not by me.

01:11.751 --> 01:15.042
If you want to talk about
someone else's health issues

01:15.042 --> 01:18.501
and you think that that person
isn't gonna come after you,

01:18.501 --> 01:19.542
think again.

01:19.542 --> 01:21.501
Sutton's in way over her head.

01:21.501 --> 01:23.042
It's not about me suing her.

01:23.042 --> 01:25.709
It's more about, "Careful
what you say about other people

01:25.709 --> 01:26.751
that aren't here."

01:26.751 --> 01:29.959
He ain't dead and gone, honey.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.375
- Well, we didn't ask to be
in this situation, Erika.

01:32.375 --> 01:33.667
We just are.

01:33.667 --> 01:36.209
So if that's the situation,
then we should all be scared.

01:36.209 --> 01:37.792
- In all fairness, though,
when she said--

01:37.792 --> 01:39.459
- Kyle. Kyle.
- "I'm concerned,"

01:39.459 --> 01:42.000
that gives credence to what
she was worried about, though.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.667
- Kyle.
She should be quiet.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.375
- You know what?
That's a little bit of a threat

01:45.375 --> 01:47.167
and that's really uncomfortable
for all of us.

01:47.167 --> 01:48.125
- No it isn't.
It's not a threat.

01:48.125 --> 01:50.000
No, it's not, Dorit.
Because you know what?

01:50.000 --> 01:51.125
She took it to another level.

01:51.125 --> 01:53.334
It's one thing to ask
and to talk and say things.

01:53.334 --> 01:54.834
It's another thing
to call someone a liar

01:54.834 --> 01:58.626
and talk about their health.

01:58.626 --> 02:01.292
- I don't think it's fair that
Erika's threatening Sutton.

02:01.292 --> 02:03.083
It sounds like she's saying
that those of us

02:03.083 --> 02:05.083
that have had doubt
or questions

02:05.083 --> 02:07.417
have the danger of being sued.

02:07.417 --> 02:10.209
Is that something that we all
have to be worried about?

02:10.209 --> 02:12.501
- I'm about to really
lose my sh-- on all of you.

02:12.501 --> 02:17.083
- Don't do it. Nope.

02:17.083 --> 02:22.542
- I'm good.

02:22.542 --> 02:36.751
- Take a breath.

02:36.751 --> 02:39.959
- You ever
call me a liar again,

02:39.959 --> 02:41.209
I'm coming for you.

02:41.209 --> 02:44.209
[tense music]

02:44.209 --> 02:49.459
â™ª

02:49.459 --> 02:52.000
Trust me.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.501
- So you're suing me?

02:53.501 --> 02:55.167
You're coming after me?

02:55.167 --> 02:56.667
Am I gonna wake up
in the morning

02:56.667 --> 02:58.584
with a horse's head in my bed?

02:58.584 --> 03:01.959
What exactly
are you saying here?

03:01.959 --> 03:04.709
I'm not doing it.
I swear to God, Erika.

03:04.709 --> 03:06.334
'Cause you--
I can't say anything

03:06.334 --> 03:07.876
that's gonna make you--
- No, you're not.

03:07.876 --> 03:09.501
Because you know what?
You called me a liar.

03:09.501 --> 03:12.459
- You've threatened me--
- No, I promise you.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.417
- I've entertained a lot,

03:14.417 --> 03:17.459
and I do not ever recall

03:17.459 --> 03:19.584
anything going off the rails
like this.

03:19.584 --> 03:21.167
- I haven't threatened you.
I promised you.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.459
- Okay, you promised.
- I made a promise to you.

03:23.459 --> 03:26.792
- The soufflÃ© is probably
falling in the kitchen.

03:26.792 --> 03:28.125
- Oh, it's no threat, honey.
- Okay.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.167
- It's a ----ing promise.
- Okay.

03:30.167 --> 03:31.918
- But on the brighter side,

03:31.918 --> 03:34.417
there's more leftovers for me.

03:34.417 --> 03:36.876
- Don't push unless you're
ready to get pushed back on.

03:36.876 --> 03:38.667
- Erika, Erika, Erika.
- And it may not be today,

03:38.667 --> 03:39.709
and it may not be next year.

03:39.709 --> 03:41.626
I will push back.
- Erika, you don't mean that.

03:41.626 --> 03:43.751
- Yes, I do. Yes, I ----ing do.
- Can I--hold on. No, no, no.

03:43.751 --> 03:45.417
That's a problem.
We can't threaten people,

03:45.417 --> 03:46.542
because then--
- No, no, no.

03:46.542 --> 03:47.751
- I'm not threatening.
I'm promising.

03:47.751 --> 03:50.083
- She's feeling like that,
and that was her original--

03:50.083 --> 03:52.042
- No, don't call me
a liar, Kyle.

03:52.042 --> 03:53.959
- No, she asked the questions.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.626
And just answer calmly.
- Where are you going?

03:55.626 --> 03:58.417
- Oh, if I'm gonna be
threatened and all of that,

03:58.417 --> 03:59.876
I am not doing it.
- Okay, bye.

03:59.876 --> 04:01.417
- Oh, yeah.
Bye is right.

04:01.417 --> 04:03.042
I'm not gonna be threatened.
No way.

04:03.042 --> 04:05.667
- Sutton.
- No way. Uh-uh.

04:05.667 --> 04:07.834
No. I am not used
to people like that--

04:07.834 --> 04:10.083
- Hold on.
- And that will make me leave.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.918
- Hold on.
- Bye. There's the door.

04:12.918 --> 04:14.501
- Come on, you guys.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

04:14.501 --> 04:17.334
We're not gonna get anywhere.
- Nope. I'm out.

04:17.334 --> 04:19.083
- Whatever.
- Oh, my God.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.292
- Sorry, Erika.

04:20.292 --> 04:22.167
- Never mind.
It's okay.

04:22.167 --> 04:24.959
[softly] Oh, my goodness.
You're really a sweetie.

04:24.959 --> 04:27.167
- Sutton.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.167
- No, no.

04:30.167 --> 04:34.918
That's zero okay.
Mm-mm.

04:34.918 --> 04:35.834
- Why can't I?

04:35.834 --> 04:38.125
What, I'm gonna sit there
and be threatened?

04:38.125 --> 04:39.209
No way.

04:39.209 --> 04:41.876
- If you've got the balls
to sit here and say it,

04:41.876 --> 04:43.751
then you've got the balls
for me to push back.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.125
- Agreed.
- And if you want to get up

04:45.125 --> 04:47.834
and walk out and have a ----ing
tantrum, then you go do that.

04:47.834 --> 04:51.042
- Y'all, she's threatened me?
- That's ----ed up.

04:51.042 --> 04:52.000
- I--I am not used
to that at all.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.209
- I get it. I know.
- What the (BLEEP)?

04:55.209 --> 04:57.334
- I know. I know.
- No, no, no, no, no.

04:57.334 --> 05:00.167
- What I saw with Erika was the
nastiest thing I've ever seen.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.918
- Everyone pushed Sutton,
to be honest.

05:02.918 --> 05:06.334
Your response was exactly
how I would've responded.

05:06.334 --> 05:08.501
Be like, "You called me a
liar," and that's what happens.

05:08.501 --> 05:10.834
- That's right.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.626
- She's gonna ruin my life,
and then say--

05:12.626 --> 05:14.626
- That's not gonna happen.
- That's not gonna happen.

05:14.626 --> 05:16.584
- That's not gonna happen.
That's not gonna happen.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.083
Listen to me.
- That's not gonna happen.

05:18.083 --> 05:19.292
- You don't get sued
for saying,

05:19.292 --> 05:21.626
"I think you're not being
honest about this situation."

05:21.626 --> 05:22.876
Okay? You don't get sued
for that.

05:22.876 --> 05:25.000
- But you guys are
riling her up, though!

05:25.000 --> 05:26.667
- Can you stop--
- You guys are riling her up.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.083
If she--
- What are you talking about?

05:28.083 --> 05:29.834
- Well, you're saying
that she said something

05:29.834 --> 05:31.209
that she hasn't said
in that room.

05:31.209 --> 05:32.918
- Yeah. I'm not gonna speak
for my friend.

05:32.918 --> 05:34.209
- So then, say it!

05:34.209 --> 05:36.417
- I was trying to help her
get it out because

05:36.417 --> 05:38.667
she said she wanted to come in
and be honest in the group.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.375
- I was!

05:40.375 --> 05:42.501
- [scoffs]
My God.

05:42.501 --> 05:45.042
The person in the room that
doesn't want to do the talking

05:45.042 --> 05:46.250
is Erika.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.459
Sutton said everything
she needed to say.

05:48.459 --> 05:49.751
Come on.
Just come in the library.

05:49.751 --> 05:50.918
We're gonna talk.
Come on.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.292
- Could you just go
in the library?

05:53.292 --> 05:54.417
- It's up to you.

05:54.417 --> 05:57.626
[engine starts]

05:57.626 --> 06:07.584
- Mwah. Bye-bye.

06:07.584 --> 06:11.292
- You freaked her out.
- Why?

06:11.292 --> 06:12.709
- She shouldn't have
called me a liar.

06:12.709 --> 06:14.292
- What do you mean, "Why?"

06:14.292 --> 06:16.459
- You guys, you're not gonna
guilt me into thinking

06:16.459 --> 06:20.250
that I beat up on somebody.
The truth is, the word "liar--"

06:20.250 --> 06:21.459
- That's not a good word.

06:21.459 --> 06:22.667
- Nobody likes
to be called a liar,

06:22.667 --> 06:24.209
but she feels really,
really threatened.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.334
- That's like saying--
a thief or a liar.

06:26.334 --> 06:28.417
- Which is what I am
continuously called

06:28.417 --> 06:31.209
every ----ing day of my life
right now.

06:31.209 --> 06:32.792
Do you think
I'm going to accept that

06:32.792 --> 06:34.626
on top of everything else
that I'm accepting?

06:34.626 --> 06:37.000
You're a ----ing idiot.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.334
- I've seen Erika lose
her temper with Eileen--

06:40.334 --> 06:44.959
- Shut the (BLEEP) up.

06:44.959 --> 06:46.209
- And with Teddy.

06:46.209 --> 06:48.626
- Don't ever say I'm pretending
'cause I'm not pretending.

06:48.626 --> 06:50.751
I'm telling you the truth.
I don't remember saying that.

06:50.751 --> 06:52.125
Don't ever say that
to me again.

06:52.125 --> 06:53.209
Don't.
- Okay.

06:53.209 --> 06:54.209
- Don't ever,
ever do that to me.

06:54.209 --> 06:56.250
- But it bothers me,
as Sutton's friend,

06:56.250 --> 06:59.417
to see her intimidated
by Erika and backing down

06:59.417 --> 07:00.918
instead of speaking up

07:00.918 --> 07:03.250
and telling her truth
about what she's been feeling.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.792
- She's a punk-ass.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.876
- Because I really think
that Erika's bark

07:06.876 --> 07:08.459
is worse than her bite.

07:08.459 --> 07:10.834
- Are we left?
Are we just the six?

07:10.834 --> 07:12.292
- It's the six of us.

07:12.292 --> 07:15.250
- Kathy, cheers to you
for having us. Thank you.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.083
- Thank you so much.
I love you so much. Thank you.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.584
- Thank you. I love you.
all: Aw.

07:18.584 --> 07:20.250
- And thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.

07:20.250 --> 07:23.209
- Thank you, everyone.
- Thank you.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.000
- Patrick was saying,
"In 50 years,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.584
I have never seen people yell
like this."

07:27.584 --> 07:30.751
- Poor Patrick.
That's all I can say.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.167
- Tell him "welcome."

07:32.167 --> 07:33.834
- Welcome to the club.
- Yes.

07:33.834 --> 07:37.083
[laughter]

07:37.083 --> 07:38.834
- Coming up...

07:38.834 --> 07:39.876
- You're pissing me off
right now.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.751
- I'm sorry that I am.
- You're pissing me off.

07:41.751 --> 07:43.334
- I wanted you to be honest.
- Because I--

07:43.334 --> 07:43.334
You talk too much,
like Dorit sometimes.

07:43.334 --> 07:48.584
- Previously on

07:48.584 --> 07:51.667
[upbeat music]

07:51.667 --> 07:55.667
â™ª

07:55.667 --> 08:01.542
[knocks on door]
- Coming.

08:01.542 --> 08:02.626
- Hello.

08:02.626 --> 08:04.083
- Long time no see.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.334
- Yes, hi.
- Hi. Come on in.

08:06.334 --> 08:08.584
- A little something.
- Aw, thank you.

08:08.584 --> 08:11.250
So sweet. Hi.
- Hi.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.542
So pretty out here.
- Thank you.

08:13.542 --> 08:15.334
- Beautiful, new home.

08:15.334 --> 08:17.626
- The first time
you did a drive-by,

08:17.626 --> 08:18.459
you and Harry Hamlin,

08:18.459 --> 08:20.167
I was talking
about this yesterday.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.626
- So funny, right?
Our little drive-by.

08:22.626 --> 08:24.501
- A little drive-by
with spaghetti sauce.

08:24.501 --> 08:27.501
- Garcelle expressed how much
she loved Harry's sauce.

08:27.501 --> 08:30.417
- This was so yummy.
- You want another bowl of it?

08:30.417 --> 08:32.209
- I want to take it home.
- Okay.

08:32.209 --> 08:33.959
- So I can eat when
no one's really looking at me.

08:33.959 --> 08:35.918
- I know.
- And so, the next day,

08:35.918 --> 08:38.209
we drove up
to Garcelle's house.

08:38.209 --> 08:39.375
- It was so good.
- It's so good.

08:39.375 --> 08:40.584
He's such a great cook,
isn't he?

08:40.584 --> 08:41.501
- Yeah, he really is.

08:41.501 --> 08:43.250
Thank you for this.
- You're so welcome.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.417
And we dropped off
his sauce for her.

08:45.417 --> 08:46.834
- I'm actually
gonna make some coffee

08:46.834 --> 08:48.334
because I haven't had any.
- Okay. Good.

08:48.334 --> 08:49.334
- Do you want coffee too?
- Yeah.

08:49.334 --> 08:51.250
I didn't get a whole lot
of sleep last night.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.501
That was a late night.
- So what's your takeaway?

08:53.501 --> 08:55.083
- Well, I need you
to fill me in

08:55.083 --> 08:57.667
because drunk Rinna
was in full swing.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.417
- Were you?
- Oh, yeah.

08:59.417 --> 09:01.083
- Champagne, or white wine?

09:01.083 --> 09:04.417
- Ooh, I'd like
some white wine.

09:04.417 --> 09:06.375
This is now my second drink.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.584
- [chanting]
We love drunk Rinna.

09:08.584 --> 09:10.042
We love drunk Rinna.

09:10.042 --> 09:11.918
- [cackles]
I've never had a bell.

09:11.918 --> 09:15.459
- I'm not sure drunk Rinna
should have a bell, though.

09:15.459 --> 09:17.417
[laughter]

09:17.417 --> 09:19.042
- You were ringing the bell,
going, "Own it.

09:19.042 --> 09:21.042
Everybody own it.
Everybody be truthful,"

09:21.042 --> 09:23.292
and I was like,
"Oh, here we go."

09:23.292 --> 09:26.000
- Oh, my God.
That's actually really funny.

09:26.000 --> 09:26.959
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

09:26.959 --> 09:30.501
I remember Erika and Sutton
having words,

09:30.501 --> 09:32.584
but I was full-on drunk
at that party.

09:32.584 --> 09:35.751
With a bell.
[laughs]

09:35.751 --> 09:38.125
- Erika lost her sh--.

09:38.125 --> 09:39.542
She threatened her.
- Oh, sh--.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.125
- And when Sutton goes,
"Is that a threat?"

09:41.125 --> 09:43.125
And she was like,
"No. It's a promise."

09:43.125 --> 09:45.417
- [gasps]
- Like, full-on.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.501
- Oh, my gosh.
So it was bad.

09:47.501 --> 09:49.542
- It was bad. We can go
sit over there, if you want.

09:49.542 --> 09:50.918
- Oh.
- It was bad.

09:50.918 --> 09:54.417
And Sutton got up.
She started crying.

09:54.417 --> 09:57.042
- Oh, I didn't see that either.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

09:57.042 --> 09:59.375
Kathy kept on saying,
"Can we do this after coffee?

09:59.375 --> 10:00.834
Can we do this after dinner?"

10:00.834 --> 10:04.167
Which I'm going to heed
the warning next week.

10:04.167 --> 10:06.834
I'm having a Haitian dinner
that I'm inviting you guys to,

10:06.834 --> 10:08.751
and, um--

10:08.751 --> 10:11.459
But I think
the more we're together,

10:11.459 --> 10:13.167
we just have to figure it out,
you know?

10:13.167 --> 10:15.083
- It's not easy.
- No, it's not easy.

10:15.083 --> 10:16.334
- It's not easy.

10:16.334 --> 10:17.709
- I checked on Sutton
this morning,

10:17.709 --> 10:19.542
and I just sent her a text
saying, "Are you okay?"

10:19.542 --> 10:20.834
And she said,
"No, I'm not okay."

10:20.834 --> 10:22.000
- Aw.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.042
- I don't know if she wants
to be alone with Erika.

10:24.042 --> 10:26.709
She feels like
Erika threatened her.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.792
- It's up to them now
to figure that out.

10:28.792 --> 10:29.792
- Yeah.

10:29.792 --> 10:32.792
- It sounds like
it was horrible.

10:32.792 --> 10:34.125
- I feel like,
and I'm gonna say this,

10:34.125 --> 10:36.626
I feel like the four of you
were together,

10:36.626 --> 10:39.209
and then me and Crystal
and Sutton are

10:39.209 --> 10:40.417
on the other side
of everything.

10:40.417 --> 10:41.709
- Why? Do you really?
- I do.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.250
I do, and I've said it
a couple of times.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.375
I just feel like you guys
look out for each other,

10:45.375 --> 10:48.959
but I don't feel like--I don't
feel like you look out for me.

10:48.959 --> 10:50.918
- Really?
- Yes.

10:50.918 --> 10:53.542
- Oh, gosh.
I'm sorry you feel that.

10:53.542 --> 10:57.250
I really don't feel that way.
- Really?

10:57.250 --> 10:58.334
- I really don't.
I think I've made--

10:58.334 --> 11:01.083
- When we were in La Quinta
and I asked Erika

11:01.083 --> 11:08.751
that question that set her off,
you totally took Erika's side.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.250
- I'm leaving.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.751
- You're leaving?
- I'm going.

11:11.751 --> 11:15.375
At your launch party,
Dorit was saying things at me.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.125
(BLEEP) you. (BLEEP) you.
- Oh, are you going?

11:18.125 --> 11:22.125
Is that the easy way,
or do you want to talk it out?

11:22.125 --> 11:23.959
- You didn't say anything.

11:23.959 --> 11:26.125
- Well, it wasn't my place
to say anything in that moment.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.834
- Rinna, come on.
You're--

11:27.834 --> 11:29.709
Then it's never your place
to say anything,

11:29.709 --> 11:31.375
but you always say stuff.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.042
- My loyalty is to the truth,

11:34.042 --> 11:35.667
how I see the truth.

11:35.667 --> 11:39.250
And what Dorit was saying,
I didn't disagree with it.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.751
I--I heard the jabs.

11:40.751 --> 11:42.083
And yet, you expect me
to, like,

11:42.083 --> 11:45.083
step in and fight your battles?

11:45.083 --> 11:46.834
Bitch, please.

11:46.834 --> 11:49.042
I choose not to nitpick
with you.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.042
And maybe you're choosing
to nitpick with me a bit,

11:51.042 --> 11:53.918
and that's okay.
So if we're gonna go there,

11:53.918 --> 11:55.167
then I'm gonna go here
with you.

11:55.167 --> 11:56.250
- Of course.
- So,

11:56.250 --> 11:59.083
you know, after the party,
with the cake and stuff,

11:59.083 --> 12:02.751
you said "thank you"
in the moment, but not after.

12:02.751 --> 12:05.792
all: â™ª Happy birthday

12:05.792 --> 12:08.626
â™ª To you

12:08.626 --> 12:10.209
- Thank you so much.

12:10.209 --> 12:12.000
- And then,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.876
I didn't get a text from you
after we brought the sauce.

12:14.876 --> 12:15.959
[quirky tense music]

12:15.959 --> 12:18.125
I would've loved to have
been able to say to Harry,

12:18.125 --> 12:20.417
"She loved the sauce.
She's thanking you for it."

12:20.417 --> 12:21.959
- I mean, I said it
when you guys were here.

12:21.959 --> 12:23.918
- You absolutely did.
But you know what I'm saying.

12:23.918 --> 12:26.876
We both can do better.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.292
But I hear how you feel.
I really do.

12:29.292 --> 12:30.209
- Yeah.
- I hear you.

12:30.209 --> 12:32.042
- Awesome.
- Great.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.709
- Good.
- Okay, good.

12:34.709 --> 12:37.709
[exciting music]

12:37.709 --> 12:48.459
â™ª

12:48.459 --> 12:50.000
- Oh!
- Oh! I'm sorry.

12:50.000 --> 12:50.792
Hi.
- Hi.

12:50.792 --> 12:53.751
- Welcome to Bonhams.
- Thank you.

12:53.751 --> 12:56.751
I'm Sutton. Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you, Sutton.

12:56.751 --> 12:58.959
So this is our home
and interior sale,

12:58.959 --> 13:01.959
which is on
the 26th of January,

13:01.959 --> 13:04.000
and we also have some jewelry
and some watches here.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.751
- Okay, this is
a scary section.

13:05.751 --> 13:07.250
- It's actually kind of
a nice section.

13:07.250 --> 13:13.501
- I know.
Oh, no.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.375
- Hi. Sorry about that. Here.
- Oh, hi. How are you?

13:15.375 --> 13:16.918
- Hi. How are you?
Welcome to Bonhams.

13:16.918 --> 13:18.709
- You're gonna die.
- Thank you--what?

13:18.709 --> 13:20.125
- We are here by ourselves.

13:20.125 --> 13:22.250
- Wow. Look at those lips.
- Well, you know.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.626
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

13:23.626 --> 13:25.834
I was feeling boss-lady today.

13:25.834 --> 13:26.834
I have a lot of things to do.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.959
I'm working a lot
for the store.

13:28.959 --> 13:31.292
This stuff goes on auction
on Tuesday.

13:31.292 --> 13:32.626
So this is like--
- Right.

13:32.626 --> 13:34.209
- Really we're getting
kind of a preview.

13:34.209 --> 13:35.209
- Okay.
- We're gonna start

13:35.209 --> 13:37.000
with the jewelry because--

13:37.000 --> 13:38.334
- Because we need that
for the store.

13:38.334 --> 13:42.125
- That's what we do.
[laughter]

13:42.125 --> 13:44.626
- Wait, look at that necklace.
This is like "The Crown."

13:44.626 --> 13:47.167
- The center necklace
is 128 carats

13:47.167 --> 13:49.167
with 30 carats of diamonds.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.250
All of this jewelry
was brought in for you

13:51.250 --> 13:53.209
for a private viewing.

13:53.209 --> 13:55.876
This is not for auction.
This is for today for you all.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.083
- Oh, okay.
That's so nice.

13:58.083 --> 13:59.292
Tell me about these earrings.

13:59.292 --> 14:01.083
- Those are seven carats each,

14:01.083 --> 14:03.250
and those are 215,000.

14:03.250 --> 14:09.083
- That's a good price
for those.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.459
Lookit. Lookit. Lookit.
They got my twin.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.292
Mine has emeralds.

14:13.292 --> 14:15.125
- Can I try that on actually?
- Yeah, of course.

14:15.125 --> 14:17.918
- I mean,
who doesn't love Cartier?

14:17.918 --> 14:20.584
Oh, my goodness.
I'm gonna take this. 4,800?

14:20.584 --> 14:22.876
- Okay. Yep.
- Yeah, I'll take this.

14:22.876 --> 14:24.125
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:24.125 --> 14:25.334
- This is cute.

14:25.334 --> 14:27.083
And what's the price
on this person?

14:27.083 --> 14:29.334
- 3,500.
- Sold.

14:29.334 --> 14:31.125
Look, we both got rings.
Pinky rings.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.501
- Yes.
- Pinky power.

14:33.501 --> 14:36.167
- Nice.
[laughter]

14:36.167 --> 14:37.959
- Don't let my earrings
walk away.

14:37.959 --> 14:41.167
- What is all this stuff?
- Oh, no. This is my--I have--

14:41.167 --> 14:42.751
- This is what--
I'll take this!

14:42.751 --> 14:44.751
- No. I have this pattern.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.209
- What is this whole set
starting at?

14:46.209 --> 14:48.083
- $2,500 to $3,500,

14:48.083 --> 14:50.083
and it's called
the "Rothschild Bird Pattern."

14:50.083 --> 14:51.542
- Why "Rothschild"?

14:51.542 --> 14:54.083
- It was a special commission
that the Rothschild family had,

14:54.083 --> 14:55.709
and then
they made more later on.

14:55.709 --> 14:57.125
- It's meant to be.
It's my niece.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.125
- Please don't outbid me
on that. You won't.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.000
- I hope you're up
bright and early Tuesday.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.834
- We all know
I kind of love an auction,

15:02.834 --> 15:04.083
which is where I find

15:04.083 --> 15:06.167
a lot of really special items
for my store.

15:06.167 --> 15:07.626
I'm about to die right now.

15:07.626 --> 15:09.584
- Oh, my God, Sutton.

15:09.584 --> 15:11.959
- [gasps]
This is very exclusive.

15:11.959 --> 15:14.292
I can preview everything
that's going to be

15:14.292 --> 15:16.083
in the auction
and kind of write things down

15:16.083 --> 15:18.000
'cause the auctions go
very fast.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I've already looked over here
at these glasses too.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.876
- I know.
I'm getting the feeling

15:21.876 --> 15:24.083
you're gonna get stuff
that I'm not gonna get.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.501
- [sighs]
It's all about the win.

15:26.501 --> 15:27.918
This is the kind of piece

15:27.918 --> 15:29.501
that I want to see
the bottom of, though.

15:29.501 --> 15:31.459
- How are you feeling today
after last night?

15:31.459 --> 15:33.209
- I'm feeling really tired.

15:33.209 --> 15:35.083
I did not sleep well
last night at all.

15:35.083 --> 15:38.375
But, you know, honestly
the hardest part for me

15:38.375 --> 15:41.334
is when you guys kept saying,
"Say more. Say more."

15:41.334 --> 15:42.459
I'm like, "What?"

15:42.459 --> 15:44.042
- I was just saying,
"Be honest,"

15:44.042 --> 15:45.876
because otherwise--
- I was being honest.

15:45.876 --> 15:47.167
- It's gonna come across,
you know,

15:47.167 --> 15:48.709
two-faced, or whatever.

15:48.709 --> 15:50.667
- I don't know what two-faced
you're talking about.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.125
I cannot listen to someone say,

15:53.125 --> 15:55.209
"You're gonna get sued,"
and then be like,

15:55.209 --> 15:58.042
"Oh, well, Polly Sunshine.
Let's go have dessert."

15:58.042 --> 15:59.000
I'm not doing that.
- No offense,

15:59.000 --> 16:00.709
but that's kind of
what you were doing.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.000
- No, it was not.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.042
- Well, when I talked to you
at your house, you were like,

16:04.042 --> 16:05.834
"I have these feelings.
I think this."

16:05.834 --> 16:08.334
- I'm gonna have to tell her.
I'm gonna say,

16:08.334 --> 16:12.167
"I said, I'm not buying it."

16:12.167 --> 16:14.042
- And then, you were like,
"You don't want to talk? Okay."

16:14.042 --> 16:15.959
- So do you want
to talk to me or not?

16:15.959 --> 16:17.542
- I don't.
I don't.

16:17.542 --> 16:19.876
I have enough problems.
- Okay.

16:19.876 --> 16:20.918
You're pissing me off
right now.

16:20.918 --> 16:23.834
- I'm sorry that I am.
- You're pissing me off.

16:23.834 --> 16:25.334
- I wanted you to be honest.
- Because I--

16:25.334 --> 16:27.918
You talk too much,
like Dorit sometimes.

16:27.918 --> 16:32.667
[dramatic musical sting]

16:32.667 --> 16:34.042
- Do you--
do you know why--

16:34.042 --> 16:36.083
Where are you going?

16:36.083 --> 16:42.417
Where are you going?
- I'm walking away from that.

16:42.417 --> 16:44.417
- Coming up...

16:44.417 --> 16:47.334
- This is dollars
not going to these victims,

16:47.334 --> 16:50.250
and she's there
with her legs in the air.

16:50.250 --> 16:50.250
It's not a good look, babe.

16:50.250 --> 16:56.083
[upbeat music]

16:56.083 --> 17:04.167
- You talk too much,
like Dorit sometimes.

17:04.167 --> 17:06.834
- Do you--
do you know why--

17:06.834 --> 17:09.167
Where are you going?
- I'm walking away from that.

17:09.167 --> 17:11.083
- Don't talk to her anymore
then if you don't want to.

17:11.083 --> 17:12.375
- I'm not going to.
- Okay?

17:12.375 --> 17:14.000
- I've given her my truth.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
She didn't like it.
She threatened me.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.167
- I understand,
and it was upsetting.

17:17.167 --> 17:19.125
- I have done nothing wrong
at all.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.751
- I'm not saying
you did anything wrong.

17:20.751 --> 17:23.501
I'm saying, I think you just
need to be honest because--

17:23.501 --> 17:25.626
- I am being honest, and I
am tired of talking about it.

17:25.626 --> 17:26.834
- I already got it.

17:26.834 --> 17:29.209
- With my ex-husband,
I have been told what to do

17:29.209 --> 17:31.042
for a very long time.

17:31.042 --> 17:33.626
And I've changed my life
so much,

17:33.626 --> 17:37.125
so now, I want people
to talk to me like an equal,

17:37.125 --> 17:39.125
talk to me like a friend,

17:39.125 --> 17:41.042
but don't tell me what to do.

17:41.042 --> 17:43.125
I'm the boss now.

17:43.125 --> 17:47.000
- Listen, all I know is, is
that you were really upset.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.459
- I can be upset, calm down,

17:49.459 --> 17:53.125
and then talk about it
in an adult way.

17:53.125 --> 17:56.125
And then, I talk about it
with a "friend," and so, I--

17:56.125 --> 17:58.250
- Is this "friend" me?
- Yeah.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.292
- So what you're saying is,
your words--what you said,

18:00.292 --> 18:02.167
you didn't mean any
of that stuff, so that's fine.

18:02.167 --> 18:03.584
- That's not
what I'm saying, Kyle.

18:03.584 --> 18:04.918
- But don't say a "friend."
- Hang on.

18:04.918 --> 18:05.959
- Because I've been
a good friend to you,

18:05.959 --> 18:08.083
and any advice I've given you
is because I care about you.

18:08.083 --> 18:10.709
Your "friend," Sutton?

18:10.709 --> 18:12.083
"(BLEEP)" off.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.584
- I don't know
how I can be more straight.

18:14.584 --> 18:16.000
I was honest with her.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.918
I did say that
I called her a liar.

18:17.918 --> 18:20.542
I did say that
I didn't believe the story.

18:20.542 --> 18:22.959
I did say I had a problem
with the timeline.

18:22.959 --> 18:27.209
I have said more things to her
than anyone in that group

18:27.209 --> 18:29.626
would ever say because
you're all scared of her.

18:29.626 --> 18:31.626
I think everyone
wanted to know

18:31.626 --> 18:34.584
the answers to the questions
that I've been asking.

18:34.584 --> 18:35.626
They just won't step up

18:35.626 --> 18:38.667
and actually ask the questions
directly to Erika.

18:38.667 --> 18:39.834
They want me to do it.

18:39.834 --> 18:40.709
- I am not afraid of Erika.

18:40.709 --> 18:42.167
She's given me nothing
to be afraid of.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.042
You looked very afraid
of her last night.

18:44.042 --> 18:47.834
- Well, when you get this
and told, "You're gonna get--"

18:47.834 --> 18:49.417
- By the way,
that's understandable.

18:49.417 --> 18:50.834
Do I think
she handled that right? No.

18:50.834 --> 18:52.751
But do I think you
handled it right? No, I don't.

18:52.751 --> 18:55.542
As your friend,
it bothered me to see you

18:55.542 --> 18:57.626
back down and be weak.
- Okay.

18:57.626 --> 18:59.834
- And as Erika's friend,
it bothered me to see her

18:59.834 --> 19:02.000
come after you like that
and be aggressive.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.083
- Okay.
- See,

19:03.083 --> 19:04.918
I think that
the stronger you are,

19:04.918 --> 19:07.709
the less that
she would've reacted like that.

19:07.709 --> 19:10.959
And now, you guys have
to figure out how you move on.

19:10.959 --> 19:17.667
But I don't want this anger
misdirected at me.

19:23.709 --> 19:25.042
- Looks gorgeous.
- It's fresh.

19:25.042 --> 19:27.834
I brought
a few little treats, honey.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.042
I hope you're hungry.
- Well, I had a late breakfast.

19:30.042 --> 19:32.042
- I know.
You had late breakfast.

19:32.042 --> 19:34.959
That's when most people
actually have lunch.

- Hmm?

19:35.834 --> 19:38.501
- Can you wait until
I actually put everything out?

19:38.501 --> 19:40.792
- Okay.
- This is date night, Bubba.

19:40.792 --> 19:43.751
Let me at least do it,
like, romantically.

19:43.751 --> 19:44.792
- Bring the champagne.

19:44.792 --> 19:48.000
One thing I'm good at is
opening bottles of champagne.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.417
- Let me do it.
Let me do it, baby.

19:50.417 --> 19:53.792
- Baby, honey.
- Are you sure?

19:53.792 --> 19:55.751
'Cause I don't like you
to shoot it across the room--

19:55.751 --> 19:57.626

19:57.626 --> 19:59.626

to a really rough start.

20:06.417 --> 20:08.959
Don't be silly, baby.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.834
First and foremost,

20:10.834 --> 20:13.667
I'm so excited to finally
have a little alone time.

20:13.667 --> 20:14.918
Wait, Bubba.

20:14.918 --> 20:19.417
Secondly, you know, the dresses
are starting to come in.

20:19.417 --> 20:20.417

- Yep?

20:20.417 --> 20:21.876
- Hello.
- Go on.

20:21.876 --> 20:23.459
- The dresses are starting
to come in.

20:23.459 --> 20:24.334
I'm very excited,

20:24.334 --> 20:26.459
so I feel like
we should kick this off

20:26.459 --> 20:29.834
to a toast for the Dorit
for Nektaria Collection.

20:29.834 --> 20:31.834
- I'll drink to that.
- Cheers.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.834
- I wish you the best of luck.
- Thank you, my love.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.626
- You're gonna be
a great success on that.

20:35.626 --> 20:36.626
- Yes.

20:36.626 --> 20:37.876
- What we putting
the caviar on?

20:37.876 --> 20:39.334
- Deviled eggs.

20:39.334 --> 20:41.918
Next week, a launch party.
- So who are you asking?

20:41.918 --> 20:44.834
- Well, I'm just gonna ask
the girls and their husbands.

20:44.834 --> 20:47.584
- How's Erika doing, honey?
What'd she say about Tom?

20:47.584 --> 20:49.501
- She doesn't really
say much about Tom.

20:49.501 --> 20:50.584
What she does say is, you know,

20:50.584 --> 20:51.876
"I've asked you guys
to be patient.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.834
"I will be able to say certain
things at a certain time,

20:54.834 --> 20:56.834
but right now,
it's not that time."

20:56.834 --> 20:59.751
- But she can say that she's
very sorry for the victims.

20:59.751 --> 21:02.834
There's a lot she can say
that is not a legal issue.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.542
I mean, you can just
turn around and say,

21:04.542 --> 21:06.667
"Look, it's devastating."

21:06.667 --> 21:08.918
- She has said that, PK.
- Has she?

21:08.918 --> 21:10.876
- The victims are
the most important thing.

21:10.876 --> 21:13.626
- Yeah. The victims, um,

21:13.626 --> 21:15.542
need to be taken care of.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.959
- Well, I don't think
she helps herself

21:16.959 --> 21:20.584
with the whole social media
posting and everything else.

21:20.584 --> 21:21.501
I think, ultimately--

21:21.501 --> 21:24.250
- You know, Kyle
brought it up, too, to me.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.626
She put a caption
the other day.

21:26.626 --> 21:29.667
She said something like,
"Eating my," you know.

21:29.667 --> 21:30.626
It was a very--

21:30.626 --> 21:33.209
I know. I know. I know.
I can't even say it.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.459
But I think was,
like, probably--

21:34.459 --> 21:35.751
I'm sure--
- I know the caption.

21:35.751 --> 21:36.918
- Do you know
what I'm talking about?

21:36.918 --> 21:40.876
- Yeah. She is an ambassador
for this lingerie brand,

21:40.876 --> 21:43.542
so she's working.
That's understandable.

21:43.542 --> 21:46.626
But some of the other things
are just provoking people

21:46.626 --> 21:48.792
to come after her even more.

21:48.792 --> 21:51.709
Personally, I think
she's going about it wrong.

21:51.709 --> 21:54.584
- It's just inappropriate at
a time that this is going on.

21:54.584 --> 21:55.876
It sends a message
that you don't care.

21:55.876 --> 21:57.834
- But she keeps
saying "alleged."

21:57.834 --> 21:59.751
- It's not alleged,
what Tom did.

21:59.751 --> 22:01.751
What's alleged is
that he's lost his mind

22:01.751 --> 22:02.709
and he don't know
what day it is

22:02.709 --> 22:04.667
and he can't remember
ten minutes ago.

22:04.667 --> 22:07.459
That's alleged.
And that's highly unlikely.

22:07.459 --> 22:09.292
I mean, that guy's been active,
borrowing money,

22:09.292 --> 22:11.792
and doing what he's been doing
for the last few years.

22:11.792 --> 22:13.709
He's suddenly caught the devil.
- Well, honey.

22:13.709 --> 22:15.167
- He suddenly
can't remember anything

22:15.167 --> 22:16.876
and don't know who he is.
- Let me tell you something.

22:16.876 --> 22:19.292
So this man that
I believed was, like,

22:19.292 --> 22:21.209
sweet, charming, kind,

22:21.209 --> 22:22.709
he also cheated on her
left, right, and center.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.501
- Yeah.

22:24.501 --> 22:26.292
- Erika does have
an outrageous life.

22:26.292 --> 22:27.876
She's spent 22 years
with a man,

22:27.876 --> 22:31.125
and, really, she discovered at
the tail-end of their marriage

22:31.125 --> 22:34.167
that he was someone
other than who he is.

22:34.167 --> 22:36.584
Is it possible that he's lied
to her for many years?

22:36.584 --> 22:37.709
Of course.

22:37.709 --> 22:42.209
I know Erika could
come out of this,

22:42.209 --> 22:43.709
create a whole new life
for herself.

22:43.709 --> 22:46.501
- Not if
she's not careful about

22:46.501 --> 22:47.751
how she conducts herself now.

22:47.751 --> 22:49.584
You need to send out
the right message,

22:49.584 --> 22:51.667
and that isn't with
your legs open in stockings.

22:51.667 --> 22:53.501
I mean, that's just
not the right message.

22:53.501 --> 22:57.584
When you portray
that you don't care

22:57.584 --> 22:58.918
and you're uninterested

22:58.918 --> 23:01.334
and you're just
living your best life,

23:01.334 --> 23:04.751
Erika's scratching the nose
of the creditors.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.292
She's scratching it.
She's saying,

23:06.292 --> 23:08.292
"I don't give a (BLEEP)
about this, this, and this."

23:08.292 --> 23:09.584
They're gonna come.
They'll come for her.

23:09.584 --> 23:11.792
I've never seen a worse
response to what's going on.

23:11.792 --> 23:13.542
- Yeah, but she's also working.
Just--I know.

23:13.542 --> 23:16.167
Okay, so let me--let me--
'cause her response might be,

23:16.167 --> 23:19.751
"I am promoting this lingerie
brand to actually earn money."

23:19.751 --> 23:21.167
- Yeah, but she also needs

23:21.167 --> 23:23.417
to protect
her long-term reputation.

23:23.417 --> 23:25.626
If I was brought in
as crisis management,

23:25.626 --> 23:27.709
I would say to her,
"It's a rechange of brand."

23:27.709 --> 23:29.292
The greatest artists
in the world do that.

23:29.292 --> 23:31.584
Nobody stays
in a certain space.

23:31.584 --> 23:35.125
And when circumstances change,
you really have to change.

23:35.125 --> 23:36.626
- Totally.
- Do you know what I mean?

23:36.626 --> 23:39.626
- Erika invented
this character, Erika Jayne,

23:39.626 --> 23:42.584
and I think that's where
she feels the most strength.

23:42.584 --> 23:44.584
That alter ego needs
to go away for a minute

23:44.584 --> 23:47.709
because I don't think
this is a good move for Erika.

23:47.709 --> 23:49.709
- I've been
through a bankruptcy,

23:49.709 --> 23:53.292
a Â£550 million-bankruptcy.

23:53.292 --> 23:54.709
It was
a billion-dollar bankruptcy.

23:54.709 --> 23:57.250
If I had behaved a certain way,

23:57.250 --> 23:59.375
they would've pushed it
and pushed it and pushed it.

23:59.375 --> 24:01.292
Do you understand?
You just can't

24:01.292 --> 24:03.125
stick your fingers up,
particularly in--

24:03.125 --> 24:05.209
Mine was a corporate situation.

24:05.209 --> 24:07.584
This is dollars
not going to these victims,

24:07.584 --> 24:10.709
which was something like
50 grand or 100 grand each,

24:10.709 --> 24:13.667
life-changing money
for these guys,

24:13.667 --> 24:16.459
and she's there
with her legs in the air.

24:16.459 --> 24:19.125
It's not a good look, babe.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.709

Guys, we're all good?
- Yes, ma'am.

24:52.584 --> 24:54.626
- Is this for the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e?
- Yes.

24:54.626 --> 24:55.709
- Those are beautiful.

24:55.709 --> 24:57.709
I love that you're wearing
your Haitian flag.

24:57.709 --> 24:59.375
Sak pasÃ©.
- N'ap boule.

24:59.375 --> 25:00.584
[laughter]
Love it.

25:00.584 --> 25:03.501
- I am very excited
to have the women over.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.918
You guys, I'm having a dinner
next week at my house,

25:05.918 --> 25:08.626
and it's going to be
a Haitian meal.

25:08.626 --> 25:09.709
- Yay.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.709
- Party.
What's happening?

25:11.709 --> 25:13.792
- I just need
to finish speaking

25:13.792 --> 25:16.667
with catering
and the bartender.

25:16.667 --> 25:18.501
- Awesome. Thank you so much.
- Yes.

25:18.501 --> 25:19.792
- I couldn't do all of this
without you.

25:19.792 --> 25:23.501
This is me opening up
my world, my culture,

25:23.501 --> 25:26.000
showing them that I want them
to get to know me more,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.667
and I'd like to get
to know them more as well.

25:28.667 --> 25:31.000
Oh, what's on the menu?
Please, do tell. Do tell.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.834
- We're gonna start
with a pÃ¢tÃ©,

25:32.834 --> 25:35.667
and then I have
a mini soup joumou.

25:35.667 --> 25:38.417
- If you don't have soup joumou
as a Haitian,

25:38.417 --> 25:39.709
we're taking your card
and your flag away.

25:39.709 --> 25:41.792
- Exactly.
- You're not really Haitian.

25:41.792 --> 25:44.542
I brought a chef because
I love cooking Haitian food,

25:44.542 --> 25:46.250
but it's definitely a process.

25:46.250 --> 25:47.459
It takes time
to cook Haitian food.

25:47.459 --> 25:49.334
I only cook it on the weekends.

25:49.334 --> 25:50.876
- Doesn't this look delicious?

25:50.876 --> 25:53.042
- It's all good.
I made some griot,

25:53.042 --> 25:54.709
which is our Haitian pork.

25:54.709 --> 25:57.584
Ham, mac and cheese.

25:57.584 --> 26:06.334
All right, guys.
I'm gonna go get dressed.

26:06.334 --> 26:09.459
- All right?
- Okay. Lay her down.

26:09.459 --> 26:11.292
This is fun.

26:11.292 --> 26:16.959
We have to amuse ourselves.

26:16.959 --> 26:19.375
[line trilling]

26:19.375 --> 26:20.292
- Yes?

26:20.292 --> 26:22.709
- Do you have an angled
eye shadow brush

26:22.709 --> 26:25.501
that I can borrow?

26:25.501 --> 26:28.501
- Can you bring it
to me, please?

26:28.501 --> 26:30.375
- Love you. Bye.

26:30.375 --> 26:32.459
She's so put out.
She doesn't have time for me.

26:32.459 --> 26:34.584
Hi, angel.
- I brought you three options,

26:34.584 --> 26:36.209
so whichever one
works best for you.

26:36.209 --> 26:37.626
- I'll bring 'em right back
to you. I promise.

26:37.626 --> 26:38.834
- Okay.
- And by the way,

26:38.834 --> 26:43.167
tomorrow we have a meeting
with your rabbi and the cantor,

26:43.167 --> 26:44.792
so be brushing up
on your Hebrew.

26:44.792 --> 26:51.334
- In person?
- Don't panic.

26:51.334 --> 26:53.042
- Well, you need to practice.
[door slams]

26:53.042 --> 26:55.542
Did you just leave?

26:55.542 --> 26:57.000
Portia?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.542
That kid of mine.

26:59.542 --> 27:02.542
[gentle music]

27:02.542 --> 27:06.417
â™ª

27:06.417 --> 27:08.417
- Pretty.

27:08.417 --> 27:12.250
Gorgeous.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.459
Hello? Oh, wow.

27:14.459 --> 27:16.459
Holy moly.
Look at this.

27:16.459 --> 27:20.792
- I'm upstairs!
- Okay.

27:20.792 --> 27:23.459
Hello.
- Hi.

27:23.459 --> 27:24.792
- Smells good.

27:24.792 --> 27:26.542
- Have you ever had
Haitian food before?

27:26.542 --> 27:27.584
- Never.
- You've never?

27:27.584 --> 27:29.542
- No. Never.
This is my first time.

27:29.542 --> 27:32.459
- You've never been to Haiti?
- I've been to the Bahamas.

27:32.459 --> 27:34.751
- Oh, okay.
So you've had conch before.

27:34.751 --> 27:36.667
- Maybe in a taco,
'cause I don't normally eat

27:36.667 --> 27:38.792
a lot of fish,
but maybe in a taco.

27:38.792 --> 27:41.334
I didn't grow up
in a fish family,

27:41.334 --> 27:43.417
so I don't like fish.

27:43.417 --> 27:44.751
I'm excited.

27:44.751 --> 27:47.083
But tonight, because
of Garcelle's evening,

27:47.083 --> 27:48.292
I'm gonna give it a go.

27:48.292 --> 27:51.876
I'm gonna try my best.

27:51.876 --> 27:53.834
- Did you make yourself
comfortable?

27:53.834 --> 27:55.709
- Entrance.
[gasps]

27:55.709 --> 27:57.834
- What, this old thing?

27:57.834 --> 28:00.292
- Queen. How gorgeous.

28:00.292 --> 28:02.751
Hon, this looks beautiful.
- Thank you.

28:02.751 --> 28:04.417
- It's gorgeous!
- Thank you.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.751
You look amazing.
- This is stunning.

28:06.751 --> 28:08.375
- Make yourself
comfortable, Rinna.

28:08.375 --> 28:10.375
- I do. You know,
now I am the first

28:10.375 --> 28:12.292
everywhere we go,
so I'm just like--

28:12.292 --> 28:14.292
- We were upstairs, and I said,

28:14.292 --> 28:17.417
"It's usually me and Rinna
that are tied

28:17.417 --> 28:18.375
to be first."
- Yeah.

28:18.375 --> 28:19.334
- I said,
"Rinna will be first."

28:19.334 --> 28:21.334
And then, I said
to my glam team,

28:21.334 --> 28:23.626
I said, "Who will be last?"
And we went, "On three."

28:23.626 --> 28:26.250
And we went,
"One, two, three. Dorit."

28:26.250 --> 28:28.334
[laughter]

28:28.334 --> 28:30.542
- I said, "I try to be late."
- 20 bucks. 20 bucks.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.125
- Okay.
- Who do you think?

28:32.125 --> 28:33.417
- You know what?
I'm gonna say Kathy.

28:33.417 --> 28:35.292
- Hello.
- Hello.

28:35.292 --> 28:37.417
- Yay!
- Oh, my God.

28:37.417 --> 28:39.417
This is stunning.
- Aw. You're stunning.

28:39.417 --> 28:41.250
- How are you?
Oh, my God.

28:41.250 --> 28:42.459
- What, what?
- I was gonna say.

28:42.459 --> 28:45.667
I wanna burrow
right down in there.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.667
- Hello.
- Hi!

28:47.667 --> 28:50.417
- Hello.
- Hi! How are you?

28:50.417 --> 28:53.292
- Oh, who is it?
Oh, it's Dorit. Oh.

28:53.292 --> 28:54.250
- We were just
talking about you.

28:54.250 --> 28:56.250
I lost a bet.
- Oh.

28:56.250 --> 28:57.792
- I said you'd be last.
- Oh, well--

28:57.792 --> 28:59.751
- For the presentation.
- Sorry to disappoint you.

28:59.751 --> 29:01.417
- No, no, no.
Not disappointed at all.

29:01.417 --> 29:03.292
But I owe her 20 bucks now.

29:03.292 --> 29:06.375
- Really? Am I always the one
that shows up last?

29:06.375 --> 29:08.292
Or is that another opportunity

29:08.292 --> 29:11.125
for you to throw a little
passive-aggressive dig,

29:11.125 --> 29:12.626
because, of course,
there's a smile.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.417
[forced laughter]

29:14.417 --> 29:15.834
- Uh, hi.
- I know!

29:15.834 --> 29:17.209
- Pay up, girl.
- I know.

29:17.209 --> 29:18.709
- Who's got 20 bucks?
Who's got 20 bucks?

29:18.709 --> 29:21.876
- I wouldn't do it.
I was like, "Nope."

29:21.876 --> 29:27.250
- Love that you just won that.

29:27.250 --> 29:31.292
[doorbell rings]

29:31.292 --> 29:32.375
- Hey!
- Ooh.

29:32.375 --> 29:33.459
- You look beautiful.
How are you?

29:33.459 --> 29:34.792
- You look sexy.
- Thank you.

29:34.792 --> 29:36.334
I'm trying, girl.
I'm trying.

29:36.334 --> 29:39.542
- Erika Jayne, everybody.
- Hello, Erika Jayne.

29:39.542 --> 29:42.292
[cheers and applause]

29:42.292 --> 29:44.626
- Um, what is the words
in the--

29:44.626 --> 29:47.042
-
Sak pasÃ©.
"How's it going?
How you doing?"

29:47.042 --> 29:48.250
And then, you say,
"N'ap boule."

29:48.250 --> 29:50.209
So sak pasÃ©?
all:
Sak pasÃ©?

29:50.209 --> 29:51.375
-
N'ap boule.
all:
N'ap boule.

29:51.375 --> 29:53.375
- Yeah!
- N'ap boule.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.501
- There will be a test
at the end of the night.

29:55.501 --> 29:57.375
- I love it.
Hi, ladies!

29:57.375 --> 29:58.459
- What would you like
to drink, baby?

29:58.459 --> 30:00.375
- Vodka.
- Vodka on the rocks?

30:00.375 --> 30:02.542
- No, with something in it.
- Okay.

30:02.542 --> 30:06.042
A vodka soda and another
martini, but let's go light,

30:06.042 --> 30:09.167
'cause the night is young
and I'm not.

30:09.167 --> 30:11.250
- Hey.
- Hi, Kyle.

30:11.250 --> 30:13.334
- This looks beautiful.

30:13.334 --> 30:14.667
- Hi, baby.
You look gorge.

30:14.667 --> 30:18.459
Your hair is amazing.
- Thank you.

30:18.459 --> 30:21.292
- This is so pretty.

30:21.292 --> 30:25.626
[knocks on door]

30:25.626 --> 30:27.542
- Thanks for showing up.

30:27.542 --> 30:30.959
I'll take your coat.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.209
- It's so awkward.

30:32.209 --> 30:35.250
But everyone is trying to be
on their best behavior

30:35.250 --> 30:37.375
because Garcelle
is making an effort,

30:37.375 --> 30:39.250
having us to her new home.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.250
- Hi, guys.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.417
- And then,
if we burn the house down,

30:42.417 --> 30:43.584
oh, God.

30:43.584 --> 30:46.459
- So who are we waiting for?
We're waiting for Kathy?

30:46.459 --> 30:48.292
- She's not coming.
- Oh.

30:48.292 --> 30:49.959
- She's not? Oh!
- I'm sorry.

30:49.959 --> 30:52.334
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, she can't come.

30:52.334 --> 30:53.417
Something came up
with one of her--

30:53.417 --> 30:54.542
- Why didn't she text me?
- Oh.

30:54.542 --> 30:56.125
- That bitch.

30:56.125 --> 30:58.292
- There we go.
- I never liked her.

30:58.292 --> 31:01.292
[laughter]

31:01.292 --> 31:03.125
Lisa Rinna?
- Yeah.

31:03.125 --> 31:06.334
- I do not want to not pay up

31:06.334 --> 31:10.292
when I say I'm gonna pay up,
Kyle Richards.

31:10.292 --> 31:13.125
- Okay. Well, there we go.
Here's my request:

31:13.125 --> 31:16.542
that this goes to a charity
of some kind of your choice.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.959
- I was just gonna say, since--

31:18.959 --> 31:21.542
I was gonna say,
since you bitches--

31:21.542 --> 31:24.250
Since you were actually
betting against me,

31:24.250 --> 31:26.042
you lost this, sweetheart.

31:26.042 --> 31:27.083
Charity, done.

31:27.083 --> 31:29.000
[laughter]

31:29.000 --> 31:30.083
- Coming up...

31:30.083 --> 31:36.292
- Stop talking.
Why am I looking at you, Dorit?

31:36.292 --> 31:36.292
- Oh, wow.

31:36.292 --> 31:39.417
[dramatic music]

31:39.417 --> 31:42.250
[lively music]

31:42.250 --> 31:45.792
â™ª

31:45.792 --> 31:48.250
- Manouschka, we're ready.

31:48.250 --> 31:53.792
Ladies, we are rea-dy.

31:53.792 --> 31:55.626
So, ladies,

31:55.626 --> 31:57.751
I just want to say,
welcome to my home.

31:57.751 --> 31:58.792
It was really important for me

31:58.792 --> 32:01.667
for you guys to get a glimpse
of my heritage,

32:01.667 --> 32:04.167
and I just wanted you guys
to sort of just get a taste

32:04.167 --> 32:06.709
of my culture and my foods.

32:06.709 --> 32:08.292
And this is Chef Manouschka.

32:08.292 --> 32:10.250
- Hello, Chef Manouschka.
- Hi, Chef.

32:10.250 --> 32:13.584
- The first dish is a pÃ¢tÃ©.
- PÃ¢tÃ© is like a fried pork.

32:13.584 --> 32:15.501
- And then the next
is soup joumou.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.209
This is our freedom soup.

32:17.209 --> 32:21.042
Basically, we were told we
weren't allowed to eat pumpkin.

32:21.042 --> 32:22.834
- And this is like
a pumpkin soup.

32:22.834 --> 32:25.042
So enjoy, and then
we'll go on to the next.

32:25.042 --> 32:27.042
- Yes.
- So explain the pumpkin.

32:27.042 --> 32:29.250
- Yeah, why not--Why
not allowed to eat pumpkins?

32:29.250 --> 32:32.167
- Yeah, why is it pumpkin?
- Only the upper class--

32:32.167 --> 32:34.667
- The white folks.
- Yeah. You know.

32:34.667 --> 32:37.000
- It took a little longer
to grow.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.334
So like, caviar, like, gold--
- Right. So it was a specialty.

32:39.334 --> 32:42.000
- Yeah.
- So it was a specialty.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.375
- And then, over here,
if you're into spicy,

32:44.375 --> 32:45.375
this is called pikliz.

32:45.375 --> 32:48.167
- If you're not brave,
don't go with the pikliz.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.584
- Okay.
- Because it's very spicy.

32:49.584 --> 32:52.083
- Honey, we like spicy,
so let me see.

32:52.083 --> 32:54.042
- Oh, okay.
Okay, Dorit.

32:54.042 --> 32:55.542
- Oh, yeah.
- Her mom's from Morocco.

32:55.542 --> 32:57.083
- Yeah. She was born
in Tangiers.

32:57.083 --> 32:58.501
She grew up in Argentina.

32:58.501 --> 33:00.083
- And your dad's Israeli?
- Yes.

33:00.083 --> 33:02.709
So there's, you know, a lot
of flavor, needless to say.

33:02.709 --> 33:04.083
That's the way I was raised.

33:04.083 --> 33:07.000
Whereas a lot of American food
is, like, very bland, you know?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.292
- Right.
- Yeah.

33:08.292 --> 33:10.209
- That's--we didn't have that.
- Yeah.

33:10.209 --> 33:11.501
- So I tend to cook that way.

33:11.501 --> 33:14.042
And to be honest with you, I
think that's one of the things

33:14.042 --> 33:17.042
that PK fell in love
with me about.

33:17.042 --> 33:19.417
When I first met PK,
we didn't have our first date

33:19.417 --> 33:23.626
until probably a month or two
after we met,

33:23.626 --> 33:25.292
and he called me up--

33:25.292 --> 33:27.125
I mean, you guys don't want
to hear this story.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.375
- Just wondering if it's
gonna go through dessert.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.667
[laughter]

33:31.667 --> 33:33.334
- Anyways,

33:33.334 --> 33:36.000
Garcelle, I love the flowers.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.375
And forgive my ignorance,

33:37.375 --> 33:39.584
but are they, like, a flower
that's typical in Haiti?

33:39.584 --> 33:41.292
- No. I wanted to do something

33:41.292 --> 33:43.375
to sort of bring us
to a tropical vibe.

33:43.375 --> 33:44.626
- Those are orchids.

33:44.626 --> 33:46.459
[dramatic musical sting]

33:46.459 --> 33:49.667
- I'm not talking about
the orchids, you (BLEEP).

33:49.667 --> 33:53.459
[tense music]

33:53.459 --> 33:55.501
- Oh, wow.
- Come on.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.292
[clinks glass]
- Sispann pale.

33:57.292 --> 33:58.709
Sispann pale.
Sispann pale.
Okay.

33:58.709 --> 34:00.125
- "Sispann pale"?

34:00.125 --> 34:01.667
- Sispann pale.
"Stop talking."

34:01.667 --> 34:04.375
Why am I looking at you, Dorit?
- Yeah, well--

34:04.375 --> 34:06.042
How many languages
you want to tell me

34:06.042 --> 34:07.083
to shut up in?

34:07.083 --> 34:09.250
[laughter]

34:09.250 --> 34:12.334
- Have Dorit and I
buried things? No.

34:12.334 --> 34:16.667
I think we just hit pause
for a moment, but we'll see.

34:16.667 --> 34:19.250
- Our next dish is
bolas de morue,

34:19.250 --> 34:22.459
which is codfish balls.

34:22.459 --> 34:25.083
When we didn't have
refrigeration,

34:25.083 --> 34:28.125
we really relied
on salting fish

34:28.125 --> 34:30.250
so it can last and sustain us,

34:30.250 --> 34:32.918
so this is a dish that really
means a lot to us as well.

34:32.918 --> 34:34.959
Enjoy.
- Yummy!

34:34.959 --> 34:37.167
- Don't even act like that
doesn't look like a wiener.

34:37.167 --> 34:39.125
It does.
- Weiner?

34:39.125 --> 34:43.042
- Oh, yes!
That is phallic-y.

34:43.042 --> 34:44.959
- Is this like
the tartar sauce?

34:44.959 --> 34:47.918
- This?

34:47.918 --> 34:50.000
- The food is not
what I'm used to.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.751
But because it's Garcelle
and her heritage,

34:52.751 --> 34:55.209
I'm making a real,
like, effort,

34:55.209 --> 34:57.125
and I'm gonna just eat it.

34:57.125 --> 35:00.959
I'm gonna eat it.

35:00.959 --> 35:02.626
I did it.
I ate fish.

35:02.626 --> 35:04.584
I did it.

35:04.584 --> 35:09.667
[crunch]
I did it.

35:09.667 --> 35:11.751
- This is lambi,

35:11.751 --> 35:15.042
which is conch with djon-djon,

35:15.042 --> 35:17.167
which is a mushroom black rice.

35:17.167 --> 35:18.959
- All right.
- Oh.

35:18.959 --> 35:21.626
- So bon appÃ©tit.
- What is conch?

35:21.626 --> 35:23.167
- It's kind of like--
- A snail.

35:23.167 --> 35:26.000
A sea snail.
- Yeah.

35:26.000 --> 35:26.834
It's the Haitian way.

35:26.834 --> 35:30.626
You don't know what you're
gonna see in the kitchen.

35:30.626 --> 35:31.959
- [quietly]
I'm not gonna eat snail.

35:31.959 --> 35:33.876
- Growing up
as a Haitian child,

35:33.876 --> 35:36.042
the only Black kid
in the whole school,

35:36.042 --> 35:39.167
I invite a friend over
who I'm excited about,

35:39.167 --> 35:40.876
my first American friend.

35:40.876 --> 35:41.834
- Ooh, I love it.

35:41.834 --> 35:43.626
- And I walk into our kitchen,

35:43.626 --> 35:47.334
and there's a dead goat's head
in the sink.

35:47.334 --> 35:49.042
- It's good.

35:49.042 --> 35:55.626
- My little white friend
was out the door.

35:55.626 --> 35:57.083
- What's that noi--
Oh, wow.

35:57.083 --> 35:58.959
Something exciting is
going on over there.

35:58.959 --> 36:01.667
- It sounds like crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.
- Lavender crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.

36:01.667 --> 36:03.125
- Yum.
- Oh, gorgeous.

36:03.125 --> 36:05.000
- It's not a Haitian dessert.
- Oh, it's not?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
- No.
- Okay.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.042
- But it's pretty.

36:07.042 --> 36:09.083
- Everything has been
so delicious. Thank you.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.542
- Yeah, it really has.
Thank you so much.

36:10.542 --> 36:12.959
- Really. Really.
- Yeah, lovely.

36:12.959 --> 36:15.042
- I ate everything of this.
- Yeah, you did.

36:15.042 --> 36:17.292
- I did. I ate everything.
- I love that.

36:17.292 --> 36:18.667
That means a lot.
- Delicious.

36:18.667 --> 36:19.959
- Are you feeling this?

36:19.959 --> 36:21.501
- I was just--
it's so interesting.

36:21.501 --> 36:23.292
There's, like--
it's, like, jewels.

36:23.292 --> 36:24.959
Like, mine is like
fake sparkles.

36:24.959 --> 36:26.959
Yours is like real jewels.

36:26.959 --> 36:29.959
- Lisa, we've had
this conversation many times.

36:29.959 --> 36:31.334
- Are we going down
the couture route?

36:31.334 --> 36:32.834
- Do you want to go down
the couture route?

36:32.834 --> 36:33.918
- No, I don't.

36:33.918 --> 36:36.334
- This one gets
very competitive when shopping.

36:36.334 --> 36:37.918
- I think you're the same.

36:37.918 --> 36:38.834
- Yeah, I am.
- Oh, okay.

36:38.834 --> 36:41.459
- She was a little nasty
to me at Bonhams.

36:41.459 --> 36:43.876
She said I was talking
to "my friend," about me,

36:43.876 --> 36:45.334
and used these marks about me.

36:45.334 --> 36:47.792
- She did not do air italics.

36:47.792 --> 36:49.918
- I talk about it
with a "friend."

36:49.918 --> 36:51.292
- She said, "My friend."

36:51.292 --> 36:53.918
- I called her "my friend."
- Kyle?

36:53.918 --> 36:56.167
- Yeah, I did,
and I'm sorry for that.

36:56.167 --> 36:57.083
You're my real friend,

36:57.083 --> 37:01.167
and I believe that 100%
and totally. I do.

37:01.167 --> 37:03.083
- Well, I'm here for Garcelle,

37:03.083 --> 37:06.375
so I really don't care
about anybody's "friendship."

37:06.375 --> 37:08.584
I'm scrolling
"The New York Times,"

37:08.584 --> 37:10.000
and it's more interesting.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.292
- I apologize for that,

37:11.292 --> 37:13.834
because it was offensive
and it was hurtful,

37:13.834 --> 37:15.751
and then we bought jewelry,
so it was all fine.

37:15.751 --> 37:17.459
But really, I'm sorry.

37:17.459 --> 37:19.834
- I appreciate that.
Thank you.

37:19.834 --> 37:21.876
- I'm glad you're "here."

37:21.876 --> 37:23.042
[laughter]

37:23.042 --> 37:25.918
- You were a little bit
of an asshole,

37:25.918 --> 37:27.417
and--but, you know.

37:27.417 --> 37:30.209
I forgot to do this.
[laughter]

37:30.209 --> 37:32.209
- God.

37:32.209 --> 37:33.334
- Coming up...

37:33.334 --> 37:35.834
- You guys aren't friends.
[dramatic musical sting]

37:35.834 --> 37:35.834
You hurt her, she hurt you,
and it's, like, over.

37:35.834 --> 37:41.042
[lively music]

37:41.042 --> 37:43.667
[upbeat music]

37:43.667 --> 37:45.083
- Should we move
to the living room?

37:45.083 --> 37:46.876
- Sure.
- This was so nice.

37:46.876 --> 37:48.167
This was a great dinner,
Garcelle.

37:48.167 --> 37:50.751
- I loved it.
- Loved it. Loved it.

37:50.751 --> 37:52.292
- It's cold.
Oh, my God.

37:52.292 --> 37:54.876
It is cold, guys.
Jiminy Cricket.

37:54.876 --> 37:56.292
- Why don't you just
pop the heater on?

37:56.292 --> 37:57.959
- The heat is on.
- Oh, it is. [laughs]

37:57.959 --> 37:59.751
- Should I pass out blankets?

37:59.751 --> 38:01.501
- Is Erika here?

38:01.501 --> 38:03.542
- There's no assigned seats.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.292
- Everybody here is
aware of the fact

38:05.292 --> 38:08.375
that Sutton and Erika
are not speaking.

38:08.375 --> 38:12.000
It is just as awkward for them
as everyone around them.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.334
- So who wants coats?
I'm passing out coats.

38:14.334 --> 38:15.751
- Coats?

38:15.751 --> 38:17.834
- That is so cute.
Here. We'll go like this.

38:17.834 --> 38:20.167
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.
Perfect.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.584
Oh, look at that cute coat.

38:21.584 --> 38:23.375
That matches you.
- I love it.

38:23.375 --> 38:25.501
- I love our party favors.
[laughter]

38:25.501 --> 38:27.250
- Isn't that cute?
- I'm always cold.

38:27.250 --> 38:29.167
- Well, you always wear
beautiful, bright colors.

38:29.167 --> 38:31.334
- Yeah, we were talking
about bright colors. Yeah.

38:31.334 --> 38:33.209
- Me too.
- I try to also.

38:33.209 --> 38:35.501
- I love the yellow Gucci pants
you wore.

38:35.501 --> 38:36.959
I've been trying to find them.
- Yeah.

38:36.959 --> 38:38.083
- Oh, I love those.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.834
- Those were good pants.

38:39.834 --> 38:42.000
- Oh, you weren't there.
You weren't invited.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.918
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, you look so pretty.

38:45.918 --> 38:47.626
I love your pants.

38:47.626 --> 38:51.000
- Oh, damn. We shouldn't
have brought that up.

38:51.000 --> 38:51.959
- You weren't invited
that night.

38:51.959 --> 38:54.209
Sorry. You weren't.
- What night was that?

38:54.209 --> 38:56.751
- She--we just--
- Well...

38:56.751 --> 38:58.209
- I don't remember
when I wore that.

38:58.209 --> 39:02.042
- So do you feel like
you've been told the truth?

39:02.042 --> 39:03.042
- No.

39:03.042 --> 39:04.209
- That's okay.

39:04.209 --> 39:06.834
- I didn't bring it up.
- Well, that makes it more--

39:06.834 --> 39:08.709
It's just the night that
we went to Dorit's house.

39:08.709 --> 39:10.417
- Yes, it's the night
we went to Dorit's house

39:10.417 --> 39:14.042
and you weren't there.

39:14.042 --> 39:15.709
- I am gonna dip out because--
- As you should.

39:15.709 --> 39:16.709
- Yeah, I know.

39:16.709 --> 39:17.959
- Me too.
I'm gonna go with you.

39:17.959 --> 39:19.501
- Yeah, you know what?
I think I might too.

39:19.501 --> 39:20.959
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.334
- Thank you so much
for everything.

39:22.334 --> 39:23.834
- Oh, my pleasure.
Thank you for coming.

39:23.834 --> 39:25.125
You're so welcome.
- Oh, thank you.

39:25.125 --> 39:26.501
- Thank you
for a beautiful evening.

39:26.501 --> 39:27.918
- Aw, thank you.
- I really had a nice--

39:27.918 --> 39:29.584
Yeah, it was gorgeous,
and the food was great.

39:29.584 --> 39:30.876
- Aw, thank you.
- I had a lot of fun.

39:30.876 --> 39:32.125
- Get home safely, you guys.

39:32.125 --> 39:34.834
- Whoo! Boy, it's chilly.
Nippy-nippy.

39:34.834 --> 39:38.083
- That was lovely.
I had a great time.

39:38.083 --> 39:40.501
- Was that the first time
that you saw Erika?

39:40.501 --> 39:43.000
- Well, yeah. You think I've
seen her in the past five days?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.667
I don't have anything to say,
so I'm good.

39:45.667 --> 39:47.667
- You don't expect an apology?

39:47.667 --> 39:49.542
- I don't care
if I get an apology or not.

39:49.542 --> 39:51.250
- Okay.
- Here's the problem.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.918
She's expecting one.

39:52.918 --> 39:54.542
- She's expecting--
[laughs haughtily]

39:54.542 --> 39:57.209
If anybody deserves an apology,

39:57.209 --> 39:59.000
it's the victims!

39:59.000 --> 40:00.834
- Erika?
- For being called a liar.

40:00.834 --> 40:03.792
- Oh.
- And then, maybe me.

40:03.792 --> 40:05.542
She threatened me,

40:05.542 --> 40:07.292
with fangs out!

40:07.292 --> 40:09.751
I got pushed
into a conversation

40:09.751 --> 40:11.626
that I didn't want to have
at a dinner table--

40:11.626 --> 40:13.751
- I agree.
- With everybody involved.

40:13.751 --> 40:15.083
- The point is,
is we're trying to say,

40:15.083 --> 40:17.375
if you say something
and you put it out there,

40:17.375 --> 40:19.083
you've got to just be honest
in the moment.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.375
If you guys have a conversation
about me that is something

40:21.375 --> 40:24.334
like calling me a liar
or that questions my integrity,

40:24.334 --> 40:26.709
please say it to me.
I want to know that.

40:26.709 --> 40:28.667
You know what I mean?
Is that making sense?

40:28.667 --> 40:31.125
- It's making sense,
but it's triggering me, though.

40:31.125 --> 40:33.334
- About what?
- About you and I.

40:33.334 --> 40:35.459
Because you're saying, "If
you're gonna call me a liar,

40:35.459 --> 40:37.417
call it to my face.
Don't wait six months,"

40:37.417 --> 40:38.918
and that's what happened
between us.

40:38.918 --> 40:41.042
- You came to my charity event,

40:41.042 --> 40:43.876
raised your paddle
to donate $5,000

40:43.876 --> 40:45.667
to Children's Hospital
Los Angeles,

40:45.667 --> 40:47.375
and never paid.
- What?

40:47.375 --> 40:50.542
I would've rather you'd say,
"Um, hello, we still haven't

40:50.542 --> 40:52.292
gotten the check,"
but we don't have to go back.

40:52.292 --> 40:54.167
- I didn't do that.
That was Children's Hospital.

40:54.167 --> 40:55.167
- I know!
- I don't handle that.

40:55.167 --> 40:57.167
- You keep saying that,
but that's not okay.

40:57.167 --> 40:59.167
- I mean, you talk
about picking a lane?

40:59.167 --> 41:00.876
I thought we were okay,
Garcelle,

41:00.876 --> 41:03.292
but now you're
switching lanes again.

41:03.292 --> 41:05.334
I don't handle that.
I'm not the money collector.

41:05.334 --> 41:07.083
- I got it.
- So--and we're past that.

41:07.083 --> 41:08.834
- No, we're past that.
- And I appreciate that.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.042
And you handled that.
- You know what I am sick of?

41:11.042 --> 41:14.334
I am sick of being
in the hot seat.

41:14.334 --> 41:16.584
- Well, what do we do about
you guys moving forward now?

41:16.584 --> 41:19.125
Because you can't just not talk
at all ever again in the group.

41:19.125 --> 41:20.417
- Well--

41:20.417 --> 41:22.792
- What do you think, guys?
- I was with her.

41:22.792 --> 41:24.167
There's no moving forward
for her.

41:24.167 --> 41:25.125
- Erika?
- Yeah.

41:25.125 --> 41:28.000
- Calling me a liar is like,
"Oh, hell no."

41:28.000 --> 41:29.042
- What if
she approaches you again?

41:29.042 --> 41:31.542
- There's nothing new to say.
- Right. Right.

41:31.542 --> 41:33.792
- And there's no apology
coming out of my mouth ever

41:33.792 --> 41:35.626
about anything that I said
at that table.

41:35.626 --> 41:37.000
- She said that?
- To me.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.542
- About Sutton?
- Yes. About Sutton.

41:38.542 --> 41:41.250
There's no path
to resolution with them.

41:41.250 --> 41:42.417
- Since Kathy's dinner?

41:42.417 --> 41:44.584
- Since Kathy's dinner,
when you called her a liar.

41:44.584 --> 41:47.083
There's no path.
- So you think just pretend?

41:47.083 --> 41:49.000
Like, the two of them, like,
just ignore each other

41:49.000 --> 41:50.751
in the group?
- There's no one pretending.

41:50.751 --> 41:51.876
They're not pretending
to be friends.

41:51.876 --> 41:54.751
They're just acting cordial.
That's what people do.

41:54.751 --> 41:57.375
- That was not
two people being cordial.

41:57.375 --> 42:01.000
That was being rude
and icing each other out,

42:01.000 --> 42:05.042
and that is uncomfortable
for everybody around them.

42:05.042 --> 42:06.709
But, like, if two people
aren't even talking,

42:06.709 --> 42:07.876
I'm just curious
if they have a plan.

42:07.876 --> 42:10.083
- That's fine. You sit at
the other ends of the table,

42:10.083 --> 42:12.083
and they don't have to talk,
and that's how people act.

42:12.083 --> 42:16.042
No one has to hang out and be,
like, phony and whatever.

42:16.042 --> 42:18.292
That's such BS. I hate that.

42:18.292 --> 42:19.667
- Well, I hate that too.

42:19.667 --> 42:21.417
But I can tell you that,
for me, personally,

42:21.417 --> 42:24.083
if I'm at a small, intimate
dinner with seven women

42:24.083 --> 42:25.626
and I know that two of us
aren't speaking,

42:25.626 --> 42:28.167
I'd feel like, "How do I
fix this moving forward,

42:28.167 --> 42:30.250
even if it's just
putting a Band-Aid?"

42:30.250 --> 42:31.542
Like, I don't know.

42:31.542 --> 42:35.834
- They don't need a and-Aid.
- No, I don't need a Band-Aid.

42:35.834 --> 42:38.209
- I think she's said plenty.

42:38.209 --> 42:40.000
I think Erika has heard plenty.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.542
And no one needs to push people
just to cause more pain.

42:43.542 --> 42:45.709
It's just
absolutely unnecessary.

42:45.709 --> 42:49.334
- So let it be.
- You guys aren't friends.

42:49.334 --> 42:51.626
You hurt her, she hurt you,
and it's, like, over.

42:51.626 --> 42:53.501
- If you're good with that
and she's okay with that,

42:53.501 --> 42:59.501
then let it go.
And it is what it is.

42:59.501 --> 43:01.083
Anyway, this was
a really beautiful night.

43:01.083 --> 43:04.000
[laughter]
It really was.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.083
- Next time

43:05.083 --> 43:07.083
on "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"...

43:07.083 --> 43:09.125
[all howling]

43:09.125 --> 43:11.209
- Sue and I communicate
with each other.

43:11.209 --> 43:12.959
[howls]

43:12.959 --> 43:15.209
- So I'm not the only crazy one
in this group.

43:15.209 --> 43:17.584
- There's actually a guy
that I'm going to show to you.

43:17.584 --> 43:18.834
- (BLEEP)!
[laughter]

43:18.834 --> 43:19.834
I see abs,

43:19.834 --> 43:23.000
and then I hear my bed springs
making noise.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.209
He's hot.

43:24.209 --> 43:25.417
- Tom's house was broken in to,

43:25.417 --> 43:26.792
and he confronted the burglar,

43:26.792 --> 43:28.584
and then had to go
have eye surgery.

43:28.584 --> 43:30.459
And then, my son had
to go over and help.

43:30.459 --> 43:32.209
- Recently?
- And then he rolled his car

43:32.209 --> 43:33.375
five times on the way home.

43:33.375 --> 43:34.626
Yeah, I'm under
a lot of stress.

43:34.626 --> 43:35.626
- Wait, what?

43:35.626 --> 43:37.000
- What you're suggesting then

43:37.000 --> 43:38.584
is that Erika's
not telling the truth.

43:38.584 --> 43:41.209
- No, I'm suggesting she's
been in a controlling marriage

43:41.209 --> 43:42.292
for 20 years,

43:42.292 --> 43:44.000
and she's still
being controlled.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.125
- There's lies
all over the place.

43:47.125 --> 43:49.167
- You had everyone up
in arms today.

43:49.167 --> 43:50.167
- About what?
What'd I do?

43:50.167 --> 43:53.042
- You said that
we're all coming after you.

43:53.042 --> 43:54.876
- I speak four languages.
- Good for you.

43:54.876 --> 43:57.167
- And that doesn't make sense
in any one of them.

43:57.167 --> 44:01.167
- My God, will you shut up?
