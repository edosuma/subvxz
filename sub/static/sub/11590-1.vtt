02:23.743 --> 02:26.109
You're makin' a big mistake!

03:31.444 --> 03:34.242
This is lke Pappas speaking
from the Schloss Treptow...

03:34.314 --> 03:37.715
in the American zone of this
still-divided city of West Berlin...

03:37.784 --> 03:41.550
the scene of what will surely be
one of the monumental moments...

03:41.621 --> 03:43.714
in the history of mankind.

03:43.790 --> 03:48.523
American and Soviet negotiators are said
to be quite close now to an agreement...

03:48.595 --> 03:52.087
pulling the world back from the brink
of nuclear annihilation...

03:52.165 --> 03:54.224
and ending the long Cold War.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.427
But a major problem remains.

03:56.502 --> 03:59.528
Several top Soviet and US
military leaders...

03:59.606 --> 04:02.575
refuse to end their bitter
opposition to the treaty...

04:02.642 --> 04:06.772
warning that it would mean
the removal of the nuclear shield...

04:06.846 --> 04:09.280
leaving both sides
vulnerable to attack.

04:09.349 --> 04:12.614
Nevertheless, the treaty
is expected to be finalized today.

04:14.721 --> 04:17.154
What is this, a Zil?

04:26.566 --> 04:29.433
- Come on, Johnny!
- Let's go, Gallagher!

04:29.502 --> 04:32.027
- Sergeant, what do you know?
- Hey, Top.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.874
- Hi, John.
- How you doin'?

04:39.045 --> 04:42.208
- Troops, troops, troops.
- Hey, Top!

04:42.282 --> 04:46.378
- We gonna knock off?
- What the fuck is that, Michaels?

04:47.820 --> 04:50.152
It's a candy bar, Top.

04:51.524 --> 04:55.290
You get hungry,
you eat some weeds, some tree bark.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.397
Some deer shit.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.064
Knock it off.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.869
- What kind of outfit you think this is?
- It's a good one, Top.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.963
We're supposed to be tough, Michaels.
Ain't Top taught you that?

05:08.041 --> 05:09.975
Was that a Baby Ruth?

05:10.043 --> 05:12.534
All right, knock it off.
Get rid of that shit.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.842
- All right, Sarge.
- Cheese dick.

05:14.914 --> 05:17.849
What do you got
in your pocket, huh?

05:21.988 --> 05:24.923
- How you doin', Gallagher?
- Good, sir.

05:24.991 --> 05:29.690
You go half a klick from the chateau
down to the road, then you double back.

05:29.762 --> 05:32.526
- Who's on the other side of the lake?
- Red team.

05:32.598 --> 05:34.156
Remember, we're watchdogs.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.133
This is the Berlin Police's
ball game.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.103
Anything goes down,
you secure and hold for them.

05:48.247 --> 05:49.339
Morning, sir.

05:52.885 --> 05:56.184
- Look, do you realize...
- Did you give me an affirmative on this?

05:56.255 --> 05:59.190
Goddamn it, Bob,
we've exhausted the option.

05:59.258 --> 06:00.691
Tom, this is insane.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.820
- Listen, we have total support...
- I'm out of it, Tom.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.598
Talk to me, Bob.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.233
- Let's move out.
- You gonna move, Michaels?

06:16.309 --> 06:18.834
I'm cleanin' up your shit
right now, dickwad.

06:23.816 --> 06:25.545
Look at that guy.

06:25.618 --> 06:29.076
Walkin' around in the cold when he could
be inside with a cup of hot coffee.

06:29.155 --> 06:33.285
- He looks pissed off.
- 'Cause he's freezing his cojones off.

06:33.359 --> 06:37.295
That's a general, guys.
Generals do a lot of thinking.

06:37.363 --> 06:40.799
That's why every time
I'm asked to be one I always say no.

06:42.268 --> 06:44.566
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.229
How are you?

06:46.305 --> 06:48.739
- Thank you.
- Good morning.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.080
Lieutenant.

07:05.892 --> 07:09.828
- I will not sanction this.
- You don't have to do anything.

07:09.896 --> 07:13.832
In fact, I want your word
that you won't do anything.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.313
Correct me if I'm wrong, Senator...

07:28.381 --> 07:30.440
but I believe we can get
immediate senate approval.

07:30.516 --> 07:33.451
- I hope so.
- We have the votes.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.612
And we'll coordinate
with the networks.

07:35.688 --> 07:37.622
- No need.
- Hello, General.

07:37.690 --> 07:40.682
We have our own relationship
with the networks.

07:40.760 --> 07:45.254
Yuri, the key word is doverie:
trust.

07:48.034 --> 07:51.162
- I seen a black German girl yesterday.
- A what?

07:51.237 --> 07:53.967
- A black German girl.
- Yeah, right.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.874
I did, man. She offered
to buy Kitner a drink.

07:57.944 --> 08:01.311
- Called me a schwarze, man.
- Hold it down.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.344
Captain.
Moving through the woods.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.320
- How many?
- Two.

08:09.388 --> 08:11.413
- Who's closest?
- Tiger Papa, sir.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.959
Get 'em.
Get me the chateau.

08:14.026 --> 08:18.656
What better way to conclude in this
holiday season, this season of peace...

08:18.731 --> 08:20.892
than to wish you merry Rozhdestvo.

08:22.401 --> 08:24.869
- Friendship and peace.
- Thank you.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.475
- Tiger Papa Three, sir.
- Got it.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.775
Papa One, we got unauthorized people
about 60 yards from you.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.645
Chateau reports
the meeting's over, sir.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.378
Jesus Christ.

08:39.452 --> 08:40.885
Button 'em up.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.650
Keep those people inside until we find
out what the heck we got going here.

09:39.478 --> 09:41.571
CP wants to know
what we got here.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.617
They're holding the conference up.

09:45.685 --> 09:48.552
All right, all right.
Tiger Papa here.

09:48.621 --> 09:52.682
What's going on? I got both negotiating
teams buttoned up, waiting on you.

09:52.758 --> 09:56.717
- We've got a situation here.
- Hand it over to the Berlin police.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.629
- We have no jurisdiction.
- Yes, sir.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.645
Look in their rucksacks, will you?

10:13.713 --> 10:15.738
Papa One, are we secure?

10:19.118 --> 10:21.552
We're secure here, sir.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.562
All right, let's go.

10:43.175 --> 10:47.339
I am pleased to announce
we have reached an agreement.

10:49.548 --> 10:51.482
Mr. Foreign Minister.

10:52.885 --> 10:55.353
From all indications,
we have an agreement.

10:55.421 --> 10:59.118
And if we stay on track,
it can be signed...

10:59.191 --> 11:02.752
at the United Nations
in ten days.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.092
What was the compromise
on verification?

11:05.164 --> 11:09.191
There'll be a formal briefing tomorrow.
Thank you very much.

11:10.269 --> 11:12.464
No more questions.

11:12.538 --> 11:14.301
How about a statement?

11:15.374 --> 11:17.001
So we have a treaty...

11:17.076 --> 11:21.172
and as we heard it will be signed by the
general secretary and the president...

11:21.247 --> 11:23.841
at the United Nations
ten days from now.

11:23.916 --> 11:27.716
But first the two leaders will take
what amounts to a symbolic journey...

11:27.787 --> 11:30.722
to herald the end of the era
of the nuclear threat.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.623
Although the itinerary
has not been released...

11:33.693 --> 11:39.029
sources tell us the general secretary
will meet the president in Washington.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.498
From there they will go
to the University of Chicago...

11:41.567 --> 11:43.501
where the atom
was first cracked.

11:43.569 --> 11:47.596
And fittingly, just before Christmas,
the season of peace...

11:47.673 --> 11:51.632
they will go to the United Nations
for this historic signing.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.010
This is lke Pappas
reporting from West Berlin.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.816
Well, Yuri?

12:13.933 --> 12:16.595
It's in all our interests, Yuri.

12:16.669 --> 12:19.399
I don't need to hear any more.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.242
Sergeant!

14:10.449 --> 14:12.383
Don't rub your eyes!

14:20.559 --> 14:22.720
Michaels! Get down!

14:53.359 --> 14:54.951
Michaels!

14:57.029 --> 14:59.497
Here! Kitner!

14:59.565 --> 15:01.192
Yeah, Top.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.326
Call a medic!

15:03.402 --> 15:05.666
Tiger Base, we need a medic.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.730
We're two klicks from the chateau
on the main access road.

15:08.807 --> 15:11.367
We need a medic now!

15:11.443 --> 15:13.707
Oh, fuck.

15:17.316 --> 15:19.250
Aw, shit.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.252
Goddamn it!

15:44.209 --> 15:46.143
Backpacker's not here, sir.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.371
Who are they?

15:48.447 --> 15:52.406
Members of a terrorist group who've
claimed responsibility for the attack.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.419
Terrorists, sir?

15:55.487 --> 15:58.456
They were pretty well organized, sir.
It was like a military operation.

16:00.526 --> 16:03.393
- All right, Sergeant, you can go.
- Thank you.

16:03.462 --> 16:07.899
I don't need to remind you that anything
about this incident is classified.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.628
Yes, sir.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.728
I'm curious, Sergeant,
why you didn't search their backpacks.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.903
We tried to, sir.
The Berlin Police, they took over.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.913
My standing orders were to hand over
the command to them in their territory.

16:23.549 --> 16:26.609
So these terrorists dressed
as Berlin Police convinced you?

16:26.685 --> 16:29.279
Excuse me, sir.
They were real cops.

16:29.355 --> 16:32.290
Berlin Police has no record
of any detachment in that area...

16:32.358 --> 16:34.986
during the time of the shooting.

16:35.060 --> 16:39.087
If they weren't cops, sir, they had
a lot of help. They had the uniforms...

16:39.164 --> 16:41.189
You're expert on Berlin police?

16:45.738 --> 16:48.969
- Is that all, sir?
- For now, yes. Thank you, Sergeant.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.278
You were with the Iran Delta
operation, correct?

16:53.946 --> 16:55.709
The aborted rescue attempt.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.125
Yes, sir.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.127
Well, Sergeant, I find it interesting
that you are twice now involved...

17:11.195 --> 17:14.222
in a situation where a degree of
negligence has resulted in a loss of...

17:14.299 --> 17:17.132
I don't recall seeing you on that
Iranian desert that night, Colonel.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.363
We were there, Sergeant.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.372
We were in the city.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.964
We were waiting.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.338
Tehran.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.812
Sundown Unit.

17:33.752 --> 17:35.185
What's funny, Sergeant?

17:35.254 --> 17:38.189
I've been doing this for 25 years, and
every time I meet one of you people...

17:38.257 --> 17:40.350
covert ops, infiltrators...

17:42.828 --> 17:45.092
I get this real bad feeling
in my guts.

17:48.267 --> 17:51.202
I guess that's what you bring
to the party, though, right, sir?

17:52.037 --> 17:54.733
What I bring to the party,
Sergeant...

17:54.807 --> 17:57.207
is competence.

17:57.276 --> 18:00.712
There was no negligence
in those woods today, sir.

18:00.779 --> 18:02.974
If you'll come out of the shadows long
enough to press charges against me...

18:03.048 --> 18:04.982
I'd be glad to defend myself.

18:05.050 --> 18:08.542
That won't be necessary, Sergeant.
That'll be all.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.350
Yes, sir.

18:18.697 --> 18:22.633
He's a good soldier, Colonel, and he
lost a fine boy up on that road today.

18:22.701 --> 18:25.636
I don't quite understand
your attitude on this.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.437
I think he fucked up, Colonel.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.480
I think he fucked up.

18:35.547 --> 18:37.481
That's my attitude.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.121
On your feet!

18:52.998 --> 18:56.297
Sorry to have to reach out
like that for you, Sergeant.

18:58.270 --> 19:02.138
You're gonna be a hero in your hometown.
You're going to Chicago.

19:02.207 --> 19:03.970
I am, sir? Doing what?

19:04.810 --> 19:08.906
We believe Soviet Intelligence is
operating within a neo-Nazi group there.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.678
We want you in that group to find out
what the Soviets are up to.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.082
Yes, sir.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.645
We believe that they plan to assassinate
the president of the United States.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.315
Jesus.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.529
I can handle it, sir.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.766
We know you can, Sergeant.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.170
We know you can.

19:57.729 --> 19:58.821
Attention!

20:14.379 --> 20:16.609
- Hey, Gallagher!
- What do you want?

20:16.682 --> 20:20.482
I been looking all over for you.
You got orders sending you stateside.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.010
- What are you talking about?
- You're taking back a package.

20:24.089 --> 20:27.855
Some sergeant keeps sluggin' officers.
They want him tomorrow.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.562
What the hell's goin' on?

20:34.099 --> 20:36.533
Somebody's yankin' your chain,
Top.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.923
I've had enough of you.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.323
You're doing good, though, Horvath.
You're tough.

21:01.393 --> 21:03.327
Cold, ugly, tough.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.329
You're pushin' it.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.899
Button it up, asshole.

21:15.574 --> 21:18.634
- What'd you do, hit an officer?
- Flyboy major in a bar.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.177
Over a woman?

21:20.245 --> 21:23.180
No, he kept bustin' off about
our advisor policy in Central America.

21:23.248 --> 21:26.376
I told him I didn't wanna hear any more,
he kept talkin', I dropped him.

21:26.451 --> 21:30.319
- Why didn't you just walk away?
- You get them stripes from walking away?

21:30.389 --> 21:33.051
There you go, Sergeant.
His name is Henke.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.424
Here's his papers. You got orders,
per diem and tickets in there.

21:36.495 --> 21:39.692
You got a MAC flight out of here,
commercial out of Frankfurt.

21:39.765 --> 21:43.997
Turn him over to the provost marshal
at Belvoir. He is all yours.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.805
Give me the keys.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.604
If I were you, I'd keep
the cuffs on that prick, Sarge.

21:53.679 --> 21:56.648
- You ain't him, shithead.
- Timmons, leave it alone.

21:56.715 --> 21:58.080
- Forget it.
- Any time.

22:02.521 --> 22:05.149
- Hold it, hold it!
- Goddamn!

22:05.223 --> 22:07.157
Get the fuck outta here.

22:07.225 --> 22:10.524
Yeah, that's right, get outta here.
Your mother's callin' you.

22:10.595 --> 22:12.961
Asshole.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.031
Damn.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.206
You're quick, Top.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.707
Well, enough.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.744
Is this your wallet?

22:27.813 --> 22:29.747
Give me that.

22:29.815 --> 22:31.976
Get in there.
Jesus Christ.

22:33.285 --> 22:35.219
Man, you're somethin', pal.

23:03.749 --> 23:05.876
You ought to be
a master sergeant by now.

23:08.086 --> 23:11.351
- How many times you been busted?
- I don't know.

23:11.423 --> 23:13.516
"I don't know." Shit.

23:17.095 --> 23:18.528
Shit.

23:21.032 --> 23:23.432
Oh, man.

23:23.502 --> 23:26.437
How long you figure before you're
back in the shit someplace, Johnny?

23:26.505 --> 23:29.406
Iran, maybe. Libya.
Nicaragua.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.942
Philippines.
Mexico, maybe.

23:34.946 --> 23:39.508
- That's what I signed up to do.
- Right. You're a patriotic individual.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.518
I don't have a problem with that.

23:42.854 --> 23:44.549
You're a mercenary, John.

23:44.623 --> 23:47.751
You're a merc for the country
you were born in. You know it.

23:48.493 --> 23:50.427
You remind me of my dad.

23:51.830 --> 23:54.162
He had this little
body and fender business...

23:54.232 --> 23:56.166
he ran out a shack...

23:56.234 --> 23:59.499
and he had this little American flag
he'd run up on a pole on that shack.

23:59.571 --> 24:01.630
Every day he runs up
the American flag...

24:01.706 --> 24:05.403
and when he died
we had to borrow the money to bury him.

24:05.477 --> 24:07.411
- What's the point?
- The point, John, is...

24:07.479 --> 24:10.471
that the Soviet and American
military-industrial complex...

24:10.549 --> 24:14.280
has the entire flag-waving,
patriotic world right by the balls.

24:14.352 --> 24:15.785
You know that.

24:18.523 --> 24:21.287
What'd you do,
read a book, Walter?

24:24.563 --> 24:26.497
You think I'm full of shit,
don't you, John?

24:27.532 --> 24:29.466
I think you're going to prison,
Walter.

24:29.534 --> 24:32.230
- You don't know where I'm goin'.
- What's that supposed to mean?

24:32.304 --> 24:35.273
It's a joke, Sarge.
It's just a joke.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.909
I'll tell you what's not a joke.

24:38.977 --> 24:43.471
For that court-martial, you better wear
those ribbons, cut your hair, shape up...

24:43.548 --> 24:45.573
- Be somebody.
- That's right.

24:46.885 --> 24:48.819
Be all you can be.

24:50.455 --> 24:51.922
Oh, Jesus.

25:03.702 --> 25:07.069
Be okay with you if I call my wife?
She lives in Arlington.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.175
Does she know
you're coming home a prisoner?

25:11.243 --> 25:13.177
Wouldn't surprise her any.

25:14.279 --> 25:16.213
Yeah, it's okay.

25:16.281 --> 25:19.216
- Got a quarter?
- Oh, Jesus.

25:19.284 --> 25:20.717
Yeah.

25:23.889 --> 25:25.322
Shit.

25:25.390 --> 25:26.982
Bitch.

25:27.058 --> 25:30.323
Says she thought I was dead,
prefers to keep thinkin' I'm dead.

25:30.395 --> 25:31.726
- Fuck her.
- Sorry.

25:31.796 --> 25:34.731
- We got time to go by the latrine?
- Yeah.

25:43.174 --> 25:45.108
- There you go, sir.
- Thanks.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.735
On guard duty, Sarge,
or just lookin' for a new roommate?

26:14.739 --> 26:17.867
You'd better step away from that mirror.
You're gonna scare yourself to death.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.503
- Go fuck yourself.
- Let's go, Henke.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.774
- You piece of squid shit.
- Let's go.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.288
Hey, buddy, you okay?

26:43.401 --> 26:44.800
Yeah, I'm okay.

26:44.869 --> 26:46.632
You sure?

26:46.705 --> 26:49.037
Where is he?
Where is his papers?

26:49.107 --> 26:52.076
- What?
- It's a big envelope.

26:52.143 --> 26:54.077
What's he talking about?

26:54.145 --> 26:56.079
- You mean this?
- Oh.

26:57.415 --> 27:00.475
Yeah.
Give me a hand, will ya?

27:00.552 --> 27:02.782
- Damn.
- You sure you're okay?

27:02.854 --> 27:04.788
Yeah, I'm okay.

27:04.856 --> 27:08.155
- How far is Arlington?
- About a 40-minute cab ride from here.

27:08.226 --> 27:10.888
- Thanks a lot.
- Hey! Your envelope.

27:10.962 --> 27:14.125
- Thanks a lot.
- You oughta get that head looked after.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.246
Be right back.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.553
- Are you Mrs. Walter Henke?
- Yes.

28:10.755 --> 28:13.724
I'm John Gallagher. I was with your
husband this morning at the airport.

28:13.792 --> 28:16.386
- Walter?
- Yes.

28:17.128 --> 28:18.356
Walter's in Germany.

28:20.865 --> 28:24.301
Could I come in for a moment, please?
It's rather important.

28:27.305 --> 28:28.738
Sure.

28:33.778 --> 28:36.713
Oh, I have to apologize
for the house.

28:36.781 --> 28:41.844
I just began working nights this month,
and I never find the time to clean up.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.981
What about Walter?

28:46.057 --> 28:47.991
He was my prisoner...

28:49.394 --> 28:50.827
and he escaped.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.830
I'd like to get ahold of him
before he makes it worse for himself.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.593
Walter, a prisoner?

28:55.667 --> 29:01.299
Look, Walter and I haven't had a lot
to say to each other in quite some time.

29:01.372 --> 29:04.933
We might as well be divorced, but
he's in Germany or some damn place...

29:05.009 --> 29:06.943
and we haven't got around to it.

29:07.011 --> 29:08.706
You know how that is.

29:10.515 --> 29:11.914
Who is that, please?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.241
That's Walter.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.389
- Colonel Gallagher?
- Yes, Nancy?

29:52.457 --> 29:56.120
There's a Sergeant Gallagher
requesting permission to see you.

29:56.861 --> 30:00.024
He said something about
being your ex-husband.

30:01.566 --> 30:02.828
Ma'am?

30:03.935 --> 30:05.527
Send him in.

30:11.376 --> 30:12.843
Hi there.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.003
Come in.

30:15.613 --> 30:17.581
Well, I'll be damned.

30:20.118 --> 30:22.086
I thought you were in Germany.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.314
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

30:25.390 --> 30:26.823
Lost some weight.

30:26.891 --> 30:28.825
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

30:29.894 --> 30:31.828
Notice anything different?

30:33.431 --> 30:35.023
Dyed your hair.

30:36.467 --> 30:38.628
You made light colonel.
Congratulations.

30:38.703 --> 30:41.433
- How do you like this room?
- It's great.

30:41.506 --> 30:45.602
I need your help. I want you to
pull this guy's service record for me.

30:47.545 --> 30:51.504
- You want me to pull a record.
- I need your help, Eileen.

30:51.583 --> 30:54.609
Yeah? What'd you do this time?
Punch out a cop?

30:54.686 --> 30:56.620
Tell a general to fuck off?

30:56.688 --> 30:59.486
I know. They caught you climbing out
the window of some lady's boudoir.

30:59.557 --> 31:03.960
No. I lost my package, a prisoner
I was bringing back from Germany.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.962
I need your help, Eileen.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.860
Welcome to Chicago.

31:09.934 --> 31:12.630
Transit Authority shuttle bus service
is available...

31:12.704 --> 31:15.969
at the Illinois Street exit,
south side of the station.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.617
Johnny, I'd like you to meet
Lieutenant Ruth Butler.

32:02.687 --> 32:06.020
- How do you do, ma'am?
- I've heard a lot about you.

32:06.090 --> 32:09.287
Fort Dix, basic. Jump school.
Currently 82nd Airborne.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.294
Temporarily attached,
Berlin Brigade.

32:11.362 --> 32:13.796
You didn't know him there?

32:14.966 --> 32:16.934
This your prisoner?

32:17.001 --> 32:19.936
No, this is the guy
the nurse says is her husband.

32:20.004 --> 32:21.437
Picture on the wall.

32:21.506 --> 32:23.667
Court-martial. Escaped.
Arrested East Berlin.

32:23.741 --> 32:26.141
- In transit as of yesterday.
- Yeah.

32:26.210 --> 32:29.202
- Anything about Vietnam?
- No. This man was not in Vietnam.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.544
My package was in 'Nam,
I'm sure of that.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.983
- Let me call the wife.
- You wanna use this phone?

32:35.053 --> 32:37.385
- I gotta go.
- Nice to have met you.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.390
- Sergeant, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

32:45.430 --> 32:47.364
What the hell is goin' on here?

32:47.432 --> 32:49.866
Let the provost marshal
figure it out.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.732
She's not home.
You gotta report in.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.242
I'm off.
I'll give you a ride.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.517
- You got the number of his cab?
- I got it.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.187
- We clean here?
- We're clean.

33:52.263 --> 33:53.696
Make the call.

33:58.069 --> 34:00.037
Where's your next assignment?
Bragg?

34:00.104 --> 34:01.799
Yeah.

34:03.307 --> 34:05.366
You still living
with that swab jockey?

34:06.244 --> 34:08.007
"Swab jockey."

34:08.079 --> 34:09.512
Yeah, the sailor.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.741
I know what "swab jockey" means.

34:12.949 --> 34:16.043
No, I'm no longer living
with Lieutenant Commander Wycross.

34:18.121 --> 34:20.090
Good, because he was a real jerk.

34:22.493 --> 34:24.324
So you're living alone?

34:24.395 --> 34:25.589
Yeah, sometimes.

34:27.098 --> 34:28.360
What does that mean?

34:28.433 --> 34:32.164
It means that sometimes I live alone
and sometimes I don't live alone.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.998
- For how long?
- A while.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.438
What's a while?

34:38.275 --> 34:41.302
- A big mammal that swims in the ocean.
- Oh, come on.

34:41.379 --> 34:43.870
- So you're alone, right?
- I said so!

34:43.947 --> 34:47.782
No, you said sometimes you live alone
and sometimes you don't live alone.

34:47.851 --> 34:50.786
It's like you're jumping
in and out of bed on a regular basis.

34:50.855 --> 34:53.449
I don't wanna talk about
my personal life with you.

34:53.524 --> 34:56.925
- I was just trying to be friendly.
- No, you weren't.

34:56.994 --> 35:00.054
Do me a favor and keep your nose
out of my P's and Q's.

35:00.131 --> 35:01.792
That's funny!

35:01.866 --> 35:06.235
And some kind of friend you are. You
don't ask about my health or my career.

35:06.304 --> 35:09.705
- How's your health?
- You just wanna talk about my sex life.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.264
How's your career?

35:19.317 --> 35:22.753
Madison Wabash,
transfer to Ravenswood.

35:29.026 --> 35:32.962
Please keep away from the edge
of the platform. Watch your step.

36:13.404 --> 36:15.497
I'll call you. Okay?

36:15.573 --> 36:18.041
You're still a pain in the ass,
Johnny Gallagher.

36:18.109 --> 36:19.508
Really?

36:22.480 --> 36:23.913
Sergeant.

36:31.255 --> 36:33.189
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Johnny!

36:33.257 --> 36:35.350
- Tom Marth.
- How you doin', buddy?

36:35.426 --> 36:37.917
- What are you doing here?
- I'm stationed at headquarters company.

36:37.995 --> 36:39.929
- How about yourself?
- In transit.

36:39.997 --> 36:43.933
I'll be a son of a gun. I still owe you
for saving my ass that time in Fort Dix.

36:44.001 --> 36:46.936
- You can buy.
- I'm gonna buy you a gallon!

36:47.004 --> 36:49.438
John Gallagher.
I need to see the provost marshal.

36:49.507 --> 36:50.906
Good to see you.

36:50.975 --> 36:53.102
- Sergeant Gallagher.
- Yes, sir?

36:53.177 --> 36:54.667
You're under house arrest.

36:54.745 --> 36:56.679
We have an apprehension order
on you...

36:56.747 --> 37:00.683
for questioning regarding the murder
of a woman this morning in Arlington.

37:50.268 --> 37:54.102
Ruth, I owe you one for this.
Be with you shortly.

37:56.807 --> 37:59.970
Why would someone want to take the place
of a guy going to prison?

38:00.044 --> 38:02.444
He gets into the country
without a passport.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.606
He's here,
no one knows he's here.

38:04.682 --> 38:07.617
Yeah, that explains
the fight at the airport.

38:07.685 --> 38:10.210
It was like a setup.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.916
Must be a very important guy.

38:12.990 --> 38:14.617
What'd he talk about?

38:14.692 --> 38:17.627
Must have been something about him
that rang true.

38:20.264 --> 38:21.754
I don't know.

38:21.832 --> 38:25.461
Who the hell knows
what's the truth and what's a lie?

38:25.536 --> 38:27.834
Why does he want
to smuggle himself in?

38:29.340 --> 38:31.501
If he isn't Walter Henke...

38:32.910 --> 38:34.844
where's the real Henke?

38:46.123 --> 38:49.456
- Hey, Walter.
- Karl?

38:49.527 --> 38:51.961
- Karl Richards. How are you?
- Let's go.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.766
Yeah, well, it ain't gonna
happen here in Chicago!

38:59.937 --> 39:03.373
You think they're not gonna hold out
a couple hundred ICBMs...

39:03.441 --> 39:05.375
somewhere up in Siberia?

39:07.611 --> 39:09.374
Martin, meet Walter Henke.

39:09.447 --> 39:11.915
Wants to be part of our effort.

39:11.982 --> 39:14.416
Nice to meet you.
Have a seat.

39:14.485 --> 39:16.919
Proud to be here.

39:16.987 --> 39:18.921
And if you don't...

39:18.989 --> 39:23.926
we got a whole lot of nuclear hell
we're gonna bring down and rain on you!

39:25.963 --> 39:28.898
And what do you think
this governors conference is about?

39:28.966 --> 39:32.333
I think it's about
jumpin' on the peace wagon...

39:32.403 --> 39:36.965
which, incidentally, is the same wagon
my daddy used to haul fertilizer in...

39:37.041 --> 39:39.475
and it's got
the same ingredients in it!

39:43.914 --> 39:46.849
We show only one court-martial
on a Special Forces advisor...

39:46.917 --> 39:49.010
who served in Salvador.

39:49.086 --> 39:51.020
Let's go in here.
Come on.

39:54.425 --> 39:58.862
Thomas Boyette. Assault, AWOL. He
got a dishonorable about ten years ago.

39:58.929 --> 40:02.194
Look at this...
"Vietnam, Guatemala...

40:02.266 --> 40:06.498
Thailand, Philippines, Salvador,
Silver Star, Bronze Star..."

40:06.570 --> 40:08.936
Who is this guy, Sgt. Rock?

40:09.006 --> 40:11.167
Operation Sundown.
What was that?

40:11.242 --> 40:15.645
- It's too secret for our file.
- What about these reference numbers?

40:15.713 --> 40:18.238
It means further information,
higher clearance.

40:18.315 --> 40:19.782
Oh, damn it.

40:19.850 --> 40:23.877
Wait, let me call in some markers
at the Pentagon...

40:23.954 --> 40:25.888
and run this stuff through.

40:25.956 --> 40:29.983
Are you sure? You've stuck your neck out
so far on this already.

40:30.060 --> 40:33.427
- If you get into "need-to-know" areas...
- Don't worry about it.

40:33.497 --> 40:36.432
Once I get something, I'll call you.
Now get out of here.

40:37.501 --> 40:38.934
Thanks, Ruth.

40:45.276 --> 40:49.713
So, did you sit on Santa's lap?
Did you tell him I was a good boy?

40:52.316 --> 40:54.750
I gotta go.
I'll call you back.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.952
Garrett here.

41:02.026 --> 41:04.460
We got something
you ought to know about.

41:06.530 --> 41:09.465
Yes, sir, I understand.

41:09.533 --> 41:11.160
But it's unauthorized.

41:11.235 --> 41:14.329
Someone's accessing
a Thomas Boyette.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.184
Lieutenant Colonel Gallagher.

41:38.262 --> 41:41.663
Eileen, something weird has come up
on this Boyette guy.

41:41.732 --> 41:45.293
- We could be in over our heads on this.
- Ruthie, what's going on?

41:45.369 --> 41:50.898
I'll meet you at your car in 10 minutes.
And don't speak to cops, MPs, anybody.

43:23.033 --> 43:25.968
- Did you get a good look at her?
- Sure. She stuck out.

43:26.036 --> 43:28.971
She was this stunning,
black military officer.

43:29.039 --> 43:33.942
Then she crossed the street, they made
a U-turn and just plowed into her.

43:34.011 --> 43:36.445
Did you get a look
at the men?

43:42.419 --> 43:44.614
Gallagher?

43:44.688 --> 43:47.623
Get up, Sergeant.
You got a phone call.

43:57.635 --> 43:58.897
Ruth's dead.

43:58.969 --> 44:00.129
What?

44:00.871 --> 44:02.168
She found something.

44:02.239 --> 44:05.299
She was scared,
and she told me to meet her by my car.

44:06.010 --> 44:10.310
When I got there, she was in the street.
They're calling it a hit-and-run.

44:10.381 --> 44:12.781
- Where are you?
- At a phone booth.

44:13.884 --> 44:16.182
You go home.
I'll meet you there.

44:16.253 --> 44:19.313
- But you're restricted to the base.
- Just go home.

44:28.132 --> 44:31.329
Marth, it's John.
I got a problem.

44:31.402 --> 44:34.428
I gotta get out of here.
Listen... No, listen to me.

44:34.505 --> 44:38.441
Get some wheels, meet me on the road
by the gate, five minutes.

45:15.646 --> 45:16.738
Hey, Top.

45:21.418 --> 45:26.515
We got a release and transfer for a man
restricted here... Sgt. John Gallagher.

46:12.236 --> 46:15.433
- I'm getting out of here.
- You're restricted!

46:15.506 --> 46:17.872
- Eileen is in trouble.
- And you're not?

46:17.941 --> 46:20.808
- I need to use your car.
- It's a truck.

46:20.878 --> 46:22.903
All right, a truck!
What do you say?

46:22.980 --> 46:25.414
In the back, under that tarp!

46:53.343 --> 46:54.605
Colonel Gallagher?

46:54.678 --> 46:56.475
Yes?

46:56.547 --> 46:58.981
Ralph Burns, Arlington Police.

46:59.049 --> 47:00.778
My partner, Tom Garcia.

47:03.420 --> 47:04.853
What's this all about?

47:04.922 --> 47:06.787
Sgt. John Gallagher, ma'am.

47:06.857 --> 47:10.156
He says he was with you
for a period of time this afternoon.

47:10.227 --> 47:11.159
Yeah?

47:12.296 --> 47:16.494
We'd appreciate it if you'd accompany us
to the station and sign a statement.

47:16.567 --> 47:19.263
He needs all the help
he can get.

47:19.336 --> 47:20.667
Okay, sure.

47:25.876 --> 47:28.310
Help! Help!

48:00.777 --> 48:03.075
Get in there! Come on!

48:03.146 --> 48:05.011
Get down!

48:06.717 --> 48:08.344
Go!

48:08.418 --> 48:10.045
Stay down!

48:11.455 --> 48:13.480
Terez!

48:26.136 --> 48:29.071
What in the devil
is that all about?

48:30.340 --> 48:32.604
- One of the clowns from the airport.
- He's dead.

48:32.676 --> 48:34.906
- I'm parked over here.
- Okay.

48:34.978 --> 48:37.606
- Get out of here.
- What? I'm not leaving now.

48:42.486 --> 48:46.013
- We're okay.
- Okay? There's a dead body here!

49:17.788 --> 49:22.157
Look at this. Arlington, Virginia
Police Department ID.

49:22.926 --> 49:26.453
Illinois driver's license
under the name Ralph Terez.

49:27.998 --> 49:31.593
A return ticket to Chicago
under the same name.

49:31.668 --> 49:34.637
- Our boy Ralphie gets around.
- Sure does.

49:34.705 --> 49:38.163
Business card.
Real estate broker, Chicago.

49:38.241 --> 49:41.642
- Henke was from Chicago.
- That's where we're gonna go.

49:43.547 --> 49:46.778
- Johnny, we have to get some help.
- Like who?

49:47.484 --> 49:50.180
I don't know.
Some real cops.

49:50.253 --> 49:53.450
Yeah. I know a guy in Chicago
I can trust.

49:53.523 --> 49:55.923
Oh, great. Chicago.

49:55.993 --> 49:57.984
There's your rental car there.

49:58.061 --> 49:59.995
I'll get those license plates.

50:12.609 --> 50:15.544
How can I leave Washington?
What about Ruth?

50:15.612 --> 50:18.376
- You're not gonna do her any good here.
- How do we know...

50:18.448 --> 50:21.246
Goddamn it, I don't know!

50:21.318 --> 50:22.910
I don't know anything...

50:22.986 --> 50:27.116
except if we're gonna get out of this
alive, we'll have to do it on our own.

50:27.190 --> 50:30.125
These people can be
anybody they want to be.

50:30.193 --> 50:33.060
That scares the piss out of me.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.967
All right, I'll drive.
I know the way to the interstate.

50:49.446 --> 50:50.708
Got something for you.

50:52.616 --> 50:54.709
- What's this?
- Records.

50:54.785 --> 50:57.185
The reason I'm in this mess.
Remember?

50:57.254 --> 51:00.746
Now, you know Henke.
The other is a guy named Boyette.

51:00.824 --> 51:02.849
It could be your package.

51:04.327 --> 51:06.591
"Thomas Boyette.

51:06.663 --> 51:07.994
Vietnam, Salvador, Silver Star..."

51:09.166 --> 51:10.428
Look at this.

51:10.500 --> 51:13.025
"Court-martial
for striking an officer."

51:13.103 --> 51:15.697
That was ten years ago.

51:15.772 --> 51:18.332
Jesus Christ.
"Operation Sundown."

51:20.277 --> 51:23.940
I just had a run-in with a colonel
from Operation Sundown.

51:24.014 --> 51:25.208
Yeah? So?

51:25.282 --> 51:26.544
Mean anything?

51:27.651 --> 51:29.585
I don't know.

52:02.185 --> 52:06.053
The final itinerary has been approved
by the staffs of both leaders...

52:06.123 --> 52:10.025
which puts the arrival of the president
and the general secretary...

52:10.093 --> 52:12.220
at 0915 hours.

52:12.295 --> 52:14.763
Who will get out of the car first?

52:14.831 --> 52:18.130
Protocol has the president
getting out of the car first.

52:18.201 --> 52:19.930
Fine.

52:20.003 --> 52:23.029
The general secretary
will take the arm of the president...

52:23.106 --> 52:25.097
and proceed
to the wreath site.

52:25.175 --> 52:28.110
We want the press and the cameras
to have as much access as possible.

52:28.178 --> 52:30.806
We're asking for 60-foot throws
in all three locations.

52:30.881 --> 52:32.143
Come on, Bob.

52:32.215 --> 52:35.981
Billions will see these two peacemakers
give their Christmas gift to the world.

52:36.052 --> 52:37.485
They can't be that close.

52:37.554 --> 52:41.490
I know you want your man reelected,
but we can wait for four years for that.

52:43.693 --> 52:46.628
We know that there are gonna be
demonstrations at the Hilton...

52:46.696 --> 52:51.429
so we're gonna keep tight control on all
security perimeters around press areas.

53:14.824 --> 53:17.759
Crowder, you're not such a bad guy.
I think I kinda like you.

53:17.827 --> 53:19.761
You're patronizing me again,
Rogers.

53:19.829 --> 53:21.990
Come on, Jack.
Come on.

53:23.400 --> 53:25.095
- General Hopkins.
- Gentlemen.

53:25.168 --> 53:26.601
How are you?

53:29.940 --> 53:33.774
- Do we stand down?
- Negative, sir.

53:33.843 --> 53:35.777
Gallagher and the woman?

53:35.845 --> 53:37.779
They're on the police network
nationwide.

53:37.847 --> 53:40.509
When they pick 'em up,
we'll take care of 'em.

53:40.584 --> 53:42.176
Go to Chicago.

53:52.028 --> 53:55.225
I assume we are entering
the third quarter.

53:56.866 --> 53:58.333
As we speak.

54:29.799 --> 54:32.290
You're gonna love this.

54:32.369 --> 54:35.395
Karl, you're right.
I love it. It's me.

54:36.606 --> 54:38.198
This way.

54:46.983 --> 54:49.918
This is Laurie.
She'll help you get set up here.

54:49.986 --> 54:52.921
- Get you anything you need.
- My own secretary.

54:53.990 --> 54:58.393
Great cover. Travel agency.
People coming in and out all the time.

54:58.461 --> 55:01.089
All your contact
will be through here.

55:01.164 --> 55:04.759
Anything you report about our friends
at the bingo hall, do it out of here.

55:04.834 --> 55:06.267
That's a secure phone.

55:06.336 --> 55:07.997
Good.

55:08.071 --> 55:09.504
Coffee.

55:10.807 --> 55:13.833
Hey, maybe I can get one
of those name plaques?

55:14.778 --> 55:16.336
Sure, we'll get you one.

55:20.674 --> 55:23.370
This setup is perfect.
Really.

55:26.580 --> 55:27.672
Yeah, it is.

56:17.395 --> 56:19.920
Hi. Is this the Henke residence?

56:19.998 --> 56:21.932
- Yeah.
- Is Walter home?

56:22.000 --> 56:23.695
He's dead.

56:25.604 --> 56:28.767
Yeah, he's been dead
for some 12 years now.

56:28.840 --> 56:31.001
Do you have a son named Walter?

56:31.910 --> 56:33.400
You mean Sonny?

56:33.478 --> 56:35.241
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is Sonny home?

56:35.313 --> 56:37.042
You a friend of Sonny's?

56:37.115 --> 56:39.675
We keep missing each other, yeah.

56:39.751 --> 56:42.549
Oh, well, the leaflets
are right inside here.

56:42.621 --> 56:46.523
They are? Leaflets.
That's wonderful. Thank you.

56:46.591 --> 56:49.583
Do you know where we can find Sonny?

56:49.661 --> 56:51.788
I don't even know
where he sleeps at night.

56:51.863 --> 56:54.593
I don't understand
this new job he's got.

56:54.666 --> 56:56.600
Do you know where he is right now?

56:56.668 --> 56:59.136
Probably at the same place
you're taking those leaflets.

56:59.204 --> 57:01.229
Oh, yeah, over at the...

57:01.306 --> 57:03.035
- The hall.
- Yeah, the hall.

57:03.108 --> 57:05.167
- The one on...
- Noble.

57:05.243 --> 57:07.404
- On Noble Street, right.
- Avenue.

57:07.479 --> 57:10.448
You know, where Noble Avenue crosses...

57:10.515 --> 57:12.380
Milwaukee.

57:12.450 --> 57:15.942
Saint Stefanski's Bingo Hall
at Milwaukee.

57:28.033 --> 57:32.902
Hi. I'm trying to locate
a Detective Milan Delich.

57:41.112 --> 57:43.046
How are you doing, fella?

57:45.483 --> 57:47.849
Great day to be an American, isn't it?

57:47.919 --> 57:50.444
- Is Sonny around?
- Sonny who?

57:54.859 --> 57:58.158
- Walter Henke.
- Are you a friend of his?

57:59.331 --> 58:02.562
What do you think I'm doing
carrying these fuckin' things around?

58:02.634 --> 58:04.659
You tell me.

58:10.275 --> 58:13.039
- Where is old Walter?
- You're his friend.

58:13.111 --> 58:16.046
His mother just asked me
to drop these off.

58:16.114 --> 58:18.048
So drop 'em.

58:44.476 --> 58:47.070
Yeah, I'll send someone
down to talk to you.

58:47.145 --> 58:49.204
Bye-bye. Thanks.

58:57.956 --> 59:00.322
So, talk to me.
What happened up there?

59:00.392 --> 59:03.020
There's just a bunch of Nazi goons.

59:04.162 --> 59:06.096
What's going on with Milan?

59:06.164 --> 59:08.564
Your buddy's a lieutenant in Vice.
He gets off at 7:00.

59:08.633 --> 59:10.533
How about that other phone number?

59:10.602 --> 59:13.765
Real estate broker.
Handles office buildings downtown.

59:35.160 --> 59:38.129
Here you go, sir. Big rally downtown
to stop the Communists.

59:38.196 --> 59:41.688
They're living right here in
our neighborhood. You aware of that?

59:41.766 --> 59:45.702
Communists here in the neighborhood.

59:45.770 --> 59:49.103
Sign up and join us.
You look like a good American.

59:49.174 --> 59:50.698
Here you go, guys.

59:50.775 --> 59:53.369
We're having a big rally downtown
to stop the Communists.

59:53.445 --> 59:56.778
They're all over the place...
TV, radio.

59:56.848 --> 59:59.146
Hey, you dropped...
Are you a Communist, pal?

01:00:02.854 --> 01:00:04.788
Call my lawyer, man.

01:00:04.856 --> 01:00:06.824
You got plenty of time
to call your lawyer.

01:00:17.101 --> 01:00:20.195
Oh, yeah. Fuckin' nice weather, huh?

01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:22.296
- Throw it right in the toilet.
- See you, Lieutenant.

01:00:22.373 --> 01:00:25.831
- Take it easy.
- Hey, Joe.

01:00:30.014 --> 01:00:31.413
- Milan?
- Yeah.

01:00:31.483 --> 01:00:33.610
Johnny Gallagher. Follow me.

01:00:47.499 --> 01:00:49.967
Yeah. Uh-huh, good.

01:00:51.102 --> 01:00:55.334
Yeah, thanks. You get anything else,
give me a call at the house.

01:00:55.406 --> 01:00:56.998
Thanks. Bye.

01:00:59.043 --> 01:01:00.635
See you.

01:01:05.016 --> 01:01:07.780
Eddie, give this guy
a glass of milk on me.

01:01:07.852 --> 01:01:09.479
What a joker.

01:01:14.592 --> 01:01:17.026
You're wanted for questioning
about a killing in Arlington...

01:01:17.095 --> 01:01:19.029
and there's
a national security tag on you.

01:01:21.132 --> 01:01:23.293
Somebody wants you real bad, Johnny.

01:01:24.602 --> 01:01:26.536
Nothing about a Lieutenant Ruth Butler?

01:01:27.272 --> 01:01:30.708
Not yet, but I got somebody
checking on that.

01:01:30.775 --> 01:01:33.175
And there was nothing about
the shoot-out in the garage last night.

01:01:33.244 --> 01:01:35.576
That seems to be going down
as between drug gangs.

01:01:37.615 --> 01:01:39.845
I don't know what you
got yourself into, pal...

01:01:39.918 --> 01:01:42.887
but their team's playing
with bigger hitters.

01:01:42.954 --> 01:01:46.219
- I know it's asking a hell of a lot.
- It sure is.

01:01:47.759 --> 01:01:49.693
I understand if you
don't want to help out.

01:01:49.761 --> 01:01:51.991
I didn't say I don't.

01:01:52.063 --> 01:01:54.327
I'm just thinking this...

01:01:54.399 --> 01:01:58.859
I got 18 years invested here,
and you come walking out of my past...

01:01:58.937 --> 01:02:02.270
saying the one year we spent in country
is all that counts.

01:02:03.975 --> 01:02:06.739
And I agree with you.

01:02:06.811 --> 01:02:10.269
And that's, like,
some kind of weird shit.

01:02:16.421 --> 01:02:17.615
Thanks.

01:02:19.424 --> 01:02:22.518
Come on.
Let's find you a place to sleep.

01:02:25.496 --> 01:02:29.626
It'd look good with this sweater too.
Just put it on the couch, honey.

01:02:32.103 --> 01:02:35.436
- I could sleep anywhere, Milan.
- Yeah, you probably could.

01:02:35.506 --> 01:02:38.805
In fact, you both look like
you could fall asleep standing up.

01:02:38.876 --> 01:02:41.868
Don't worry, he's used to it.
There we go.

01:02:43.247 --> 01:02:46.239
I gotta stop feeding that kid.

01:02:46.317 --> 01:02:49.445
- How do you like this?
- Listen, you want a beer?

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.886
Yeah.

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.950
Move back. Move back.

01:03:30.595 --> 01:03:33.120
I want this corridor emptied...

01:03:33.197 --> 01:03:37.463
sealed and posted one hour
before TSD arrives with the dogs.

01:03:40.104 --> 01:03:43.562
Keep the kitchen staff to a minimum.
Everyone here's been cleared, right?

01:03:43.641 --> 01:03:44.665
Yes, sir.

01:03:44.742 --> 01:03:48.803
Rogers will want to take some pictures.
Keep the happy ones up front.

01:04:07.498 --> 01:04:10.956
Gallagher knows too much already.
He has to be eliminated.

01:04:11.035 --> 01:04:16.371
How much can he know? His pal,
Lieutenant Delich, would be humming.

01:04:16.441 --> 01:04:18.671
Maybe you ought to
scrap this thing, Colonel.

01:04:18.743 --> 01:04:22.008
Maybe we ought to scrub the whole
goddamn country. That suit you?

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.640
Suit yourself. I do.

01:04:24.716 --> 01:04:28.379
You have thus far, otherwise
this wouldn't be necessary, would it?

01:04:30.388 --> 01:04:32.322
- We'll follow them tomorrow.
- No.

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:36.053
You want somebody, don't follow them.
Wait until they come to you.

01:04:36.127 --> 01:04:38.322
This detective friend of Gallagher's...

01:04:38.396 --> 01:04:40.557
has been looking for information
on Terez, right?

01:04:41.733 --> 01:04:43.667
- Yeah.
- So give him some.

01:04:43.735 --> 01:04:46.932
Set something up. And when they
reach for it, kill 'em both.

01:04:49.173 --> 01:04:51.607
- Where are you going?
- The opera.

01:04:51.676 --> 01:04:54.338
- It's a toddling town.
- Season's over. Where are you going?

01:04:55.346 --> 01:04:58.543
You want Gallagher killed, kill him.
You don't need me, sir.

01:04:58.616 --> 01:05:00.550
You're a professional.

01:05:13.397 --> 01:05:16.059
There's no criminal activity
going on in here, is there?

01:05:16.134 --> 01:05:17.601
I don't know.

01:05:18.603 --> 01:05:23.233
Mr. Henke's application seemed
to indicate he was a solid citizen.

01:05:23.307 --> 01:05:25.935
Yeah, listen.
Did he look like this?

01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:27.944
I wouldn't know.
I never met him.

01:05:28.012 --> 01:05:31.778
- His secretary runs the suite.
- That makes sense.

01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:42.025
- Look at these.
- Yeah.

01:05:42.093 --> 01:05:43.822
Some kind of connection here.

01:05:43.895 --> 01:05:47.661
Commies go home! Commies go home!

01:06:03.047 --> 01:06:05.515
Stop the war machine!

01:06:05.583 --> 01:06:07.551
Peace is patriotic!

01:06:23.501 --> 01:06:26.129
- Excuse me, Governor Thompson.
- Governor Thompson.

01:06:34.946 --> 01:06:38.677
The guy in the black jacket,
in the stocking cap.

01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:40.774
Right there.
I think that's Walter Henke.

01:06:40.852 --> 01:06:43.844
If we get separated, meet at my house.

01:06:51.095 --> 01:06:53.655
I'll rip your heads off,
you motherfuckers.

01:06:53.731 --> 01:06:55.198
You want more?

01:07:00.404 --> 01:07:03.498
Hey, Sonny! Sonny!

01:07:07.011 --> 01:07:08.945
Come on, Henke, we're out of here.

01:07:37.408 --> 01:07:41.071
Move it back! Move!
Break it up!

01:07:45.483 --> 01:07:47.417
Get out of here.

01:08:10.007 --> 01:08:12.339
It's all clear down here.

01:08:20.885 --> 01:08:23.216
- All the exits are covered?
- Right over here, sir.

01:08:23.287 --> 01:08:25.220
It's over here to the left.

01:08:33.497 --> 01:08:35.761
I'll take that here, sir.

01:08:41.939 --> 01:08:44.407
Pardon, miss.
Press credentials only.

01:08:44.475 --> 01:08:47.103
My husband's waiting inside for me.

01:08:47.178 --> 01:08:49.908
I'm sorry, miss.
I'm just doing my job.

01:08:58.723 --> 01:09:00.657
They put Henke in a squad car.

01:09:00.725 --> 01:09:03.716
They probably took him to 11th Street.
Let's get over there.

01:09:03.794 --> 01:09:05.988
- Where's Eileen?
- She went into the hotel.

01:09:06.063 --> 01:09:09.328
If you wanna get this guy Henke alone,
I gotta pull him quick.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:12.801
Eileen can take care of herself.
She'll get in touch through Betty.

01:09:17.475 --> 01:09:21.104
Good to see you, Lieutenant.
You don't need a partner, do you?

01:09:21.178 --> 01:09:24.545
Lucky to be in here. There's a bunch
of fuckin' wackos out there.

01:09:24.615 --> 01:09:27.448
Albert, come on, man.

01:09:27.518 --> 01:09:29.452
We ain't got all day.

01:09:37.862 --> 01:09:39.796
Come on, Albert.

01:09:47.505 --> 01:09:51.372
All right, everybody up.
I need to see everybody here.

01:10:01.419 --> 01:10:04.616
- Is this everybody you brought in?
- They were all brought here.

01:10:04.688 --> 01:10:06.918
The guy you're lookin' for
must have got away.

01:10:06.991 --> 01:10:08.583
Shit.

01:10:11.028 --> 01:10:13.553
He should've been here.
Maybe they took him somewhere else.

01:10:13.631 --> 01:10:15.997
- You'll get him, Lieutenant.
- Listen, thanks.

01:10:16.067 --> 01:10:17.967
No problem. Adiós.

01:10:18.035 --> 01:10:19.662
- Lieutenant Delich?
- Yeah.

01:10:19.737 --> 01:10:21.534
I'm Richards from Intelligence.

01:10:21.605 --> 01:10:24.904
One of our undercover guys,
Tony Maruss, says you know him.

01:10:24.975 --> 01:10:28.536
He asked me to tell you he's got
something for you on a guy named Terez.

01:10:28.612 --> 01:10:31.410
He wants to meet you tonight, 11:00,
some joint called...

01:10:31.482 --> 01:10:33.541
the New Yankee Grill
over on Wilson Avenue.

01:10:33.617 --> 01:10:37.951
- You know where it's at?
- No, but I'll find it. Thanks.

01:10:55.606 --> 01:10:57.198
Hello, Tony.

01:10:59.743 --> 01:11:01.233
Who's this?

01:11:01.312 --> 01:11:03.246
He's with the state's attorney.
Let's get a booth.

01:11:03.314 --> 01:11:05.305
Hey, I don't know the man.

01:11:06.317 --> 01:11:11.277
You know me, don't you?
The fuckin' guy's with me. Come on.

01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:15.425
You think I'm bringin'
fuckin' Al Capone in here?

01:11:23.968 --> 01:11:26.801
I wanna see some identification.

01:11:26.871 --> 01:11:29.840
- Coffee, gentlemen?
- Yeah.

01:11:29.907 --> 01:11:32.501
He's undercover.
He's not carrying identification.

01:11:34.578 --> 01:11:36.409
- Drugs?
- Rackets.

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.947
Don't he talk?

01:11:42.386 --> 01:11:44.445
Okay. What do you got for me?

01:11:45.756 --> 01:11:48.350
- You were told I got something for you?
- Yeah.

01:11:49.593 --> 01:11:52.187
- We've been set up.
- Let's get out of here.

01:12:24.028 --> 01:12:27.657
- How many were there?
- I counted three. What do you think?

01:12:27.731 --> 01:12:29.995
Yeah.

01:12:30.067 --> 01:12:33.161
All right, police.
It's all over with.

01:12:42.112 --> 01:12:44.171
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

01:12:53.357 --> 01:12:55.518
You crazy son of a bitch!

01:12:55.593 --> 01:12:58.653
- You all right?
- Get him, John.

01:13:27.157 --> 01:13:28.681
Up!

01:13:28.759 --> 01:13:32.251
- Back, back.
- Anything you want, buddy.

01:14:05.296 --> 01:14:07.787
Call an ambulance! Now!

01:14:07.865 --> 01:14:09.457
Go on!

01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:15.070
You okay, pal?

01:14:16.807 --> 01:14:20.971
Hey, Johnny, walk away, man.

01:14:21.045 --> 01:14:23.843
- I can't do that.
- Go on, get out of here.

01:14:23.914 --> 01:14:25.074
No, no.

01:14:25.149 --> 01:14:28.607
Just hold on. Hold on.

01:14:42.499 --> 01:14:44.433
- I'll come and see you.
- Be careful.

01:14:44.501 --> 01:14:46.492
I will.

01:14:50.541 --> 01:14:52.133
That's him.

01:14:53.477 --> 01:14:55.536
I'll see you at the hospital.

01:14:55.612 --> 01:14:58.342
- Come on, folks. Show's over.
- Okay, let's go!

01:15:01.385 --> 01:15:05.048
Don't move, you son of a bitch.

01:15:05.122 --> 01:15:08.023
Hey, wait a minute.
I want to talk to you.

01:15:08.092 --> 01:15:10.356
Yeah, sure.
You can talk to everybody.

01:15:10.427 --> 01:15:13.658
- Come on!
- The army wants to talk to you.

01:15:13.731 --> 01:15:15.995
Arlington, Virginia Police
want to talk to you.

01:15:16.066 --> 01:15:18.398
A lot of people looking for you, pal.

01:15:18.469 --> 01:15:20.733
Sergeant John Gallagher,
you're coming with us.

01:15:20.804 --> 01:15:23.364
- Wait a minute.
- You're coming with us!

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.374
- Who the hell are these guys?
- Let's go!

01:15:25.442 --> 01:15:27.433
- Get in the car!
- I wanna talk to you a second.

01:15:27.511 --> 01:15:29.103
In the car!

01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:52.662
We're gonna have two cars
on Michigan and Balbo...

01:15:52.736 --> 01:15:56.001
two on 8th and Michigan,
and five more outside the arrival car.

01:15:56.073 --> 01:15:58.007
The Secret Service is gonna have
sharpshooters on the roof.

01:15:58.075 --> 01:16:00.009
I want a man up there with a radio.

01:16:00.077 --> 01:16:02.841
All days off are cancelled,
and no time due.

01:16:02.913 --> 01:16:05.211
Tell Crededio to get healthy.
Merryweather.

01:16:05.282 --> 01:16:07.682
Take 'em around the corner
and show 'em the side.

01:16:16.693 --> 01:16:19.890
Hey, Chicago, are you ready
for treaty-lock?

01:16:19.963 --> 01:16:22.864
If you're traveling in the downtown area
tomorrow, traffic is gonna be murder...

01:16:22.933 --> 01:16:24.867
from O'Hare all the way into the Loop.

01:16:24.935 --> 01:16:28.666
The president and Soviet premier are
gonna make Christmas shopping harder.

01:16:28.739 --> 01:16:31.731
- The president.
- Blind him.

01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:35.743
So what do you think of the treaty?
All lines are open for your calls.

01:16:35.813 --> 01:16:38.077
Let's hear whether
you're for or against the treaty.

01:16:38.148 --> 01:16:43.085
- I've got a caller on line one.
- Hello, Ira? This is Nick from Cicero.

01:16:45.789 --> 01:16:48.485
- Did he talk to you?
- No, they've got him sedated.

01:16:48.559 --> 01:16:50.720
- But he's okay?
- So they say.

01:16:50.794 --> 01:16:53.627
- Do they know anything?
- Nobody knows anything.

01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:56.257
Milan was in a gunfight...
some narcotic thing.

01:16:56.333 --> 01:16:59.700
A lot of men were hurt.
Detectives are waiting to talk to Milan.

01:16:59.770 --> 01:17:02.500
- But Johnny?
- I don't know, Eileen.

01:17:02.573 --> 01:17:04.803
He'll call you here, won't he?

01:17:19.556 --> 01:17:21.581
The only question, I think,
remaining now...

01:17:21.658 --> 01:17:23.592
is what gamble he has made here with...

01:17:34.905 --> 01:17:38.500
...the strongest force in the Soviet
Union after the Communist Party.

01:17:57.027 --> 01:17:59.791
First-class accommodations, Sarge.

01:17:59.863 --> 01:18:01.455
Hug the post.

01:18:05.736 --> 01:18:07.328
Hit the ground.

01:18:09.273 --> 01:18:10.763
Right hand.

01:18:10.841 --> 01:18:13.674
Nothing but the best for you, Sarge.

01:18:13.744 --> 01:18:15.678
Have a good night.

01:18:24.421 --> 01:18:26.355
What you got to eat around here?

01:18:27.524 --> 01:18:29.082
Why'd you bring him here?

01:18:29.159 --> 01:18:31.093
Where the fuck else we gonna take him?

01:18:31.161 --> 01:18:33.095
We keep him here until
they tell us what they want done.

01:18:33.163 --> 01:18:35.495
Brilliant.

01:19:27.084 --> 01:19:28.676
Clear.

01:19:42.499 --> 01:19:45.900
- Is there plating behind the podium?
- Yes, sir. That came in last night.

01:19:47.237 --> 01:19:49.933
Put a man in the booth
behind that follow spot.

01:19:50.007 --> 01:19:52.271
The field office
will provide another agent.

01:19:56.546 --> 01:19:59.071
They're airborne.

01:19:59.149 --> 01:20:02.277
- Better get to O'Hare.
- Agent Clark.

01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:56.461
Target acquisition photos.

01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.474
Right, Tom?

01:21:07.384 --> 01:21:09.249
Who are you working for?

01:21:10.153 --> 01:21:13.145
Johnny, that information
is privileged and confidential.

01:21:15.058 --> 01:21:17.219
I can tell you it pays very well.

01:21:17.294 --> 01:21:19.524
Who? Who pays you?

01:21:19.596 --> 01:21:22.030
Everybody pays me.

01:21:23.567 --> 01:21:25.558
I'm a public servant.

01:21:27.738 --> 01:21:29.763
You're a walking zero.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.074
You're a walking fucking zero!

01:23:08.138 --> 01:23:11.039
The president and general secretary
have arrived here...

01:23:11.107 --> 01:23:13.371
at the University of Chicago
on the second leg...

01:23:13.443 --> 01:23:16.935
of their historic journey meant
to signal the end of the nuclear threat.

01:23:17.013 --> 01:23:21.950
The two leaders are placing a wreath
at the memorial here on the campus...

01:23:22.018 --> 01:23:26.182
near the spot where Enrico Fermi
and a team of dedicated scientists...

01:23:26.256 --> 01:23:28.190
first cracked the atom,
opening the way...

01:23:28.258 --> 01:23:31.785
not only for the use of nuclear energy
for peaceful purposes...

01:23:31.862 --> 01:23:36.026
but for the creation of the horrible
weapons of mass destruction...

01:23:36.099 --> 01:23:40.126
that the Soviet and American treaty
now aims to eliminate.

01:23:41.171 --> 01:23:44.402
Accompanying the president
and his Soviet counterpart...

01:23:44.474 --> 01:23:46.408
is the secretary of state
and members of...

01:23:46.476 --> 01:23:48.808
the Soviet and American
negotiating teams.

01:23:48.879 --> 01:23:52.576
From here, the leaders will ride
together to the Hilton Hotel...

01:23:52.649 --> 01:23:54.981
on the Chicago lakefront
to tell a meeting...

01:23:55.051 --> 01:23:58.509
of the National Governor's Conference
that the signing of the treaty...

01:23:58.588 --> 01:24:01.022
will launch a new era
of political, economic...

01:24:01.091 --> 01:24:03.992
and cultural cooperation
between the superpowers...

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:07.359
and a new era of peace
for the world.

01:24:12.669 --> 01:24:15.661
- Where the fuck are you going?
- His girlfriend.

01:24:15.739 --> 01:24:19.573
- Think you can handle old Sarge?
- No problem.

01:24:28.585 --> 01:24:31.383
You see, what this
is gonna look like, Sarge...

01:24:31.454 --> 01:24:34.287
is that you were one of
the so-called conspirators.

01:24:36.526 --> 01:24:41.691
And in trying to destroy evidence,
you messed up.

01:24:41.765 --> 01:24:43.960
Blew yourself up with it.

01:24:57.113 --> 01:24:59.047
Enjoy your milk and cookies?

01:25:03.553 --> 01:25:05.544
Personally...

01:25:05.622 --> 01:25:08.090
I think I should blow your fuckin'
brains out the back of your head.

01:25:08.158 --> 01:25:10.092
What do you think?

01:25:39.689 --> 01:25:41.486
Shit.

01:26:01.478 --> 01:26:04.879
Hope you guys like your eggs scrambled.
That's all I know how to do.

01:26:04.948 --> 01:26:07.644
- I'm not even hungry.
- Mom said you loved 'em.

01:26:07.717 --> 01:26:10.982
I do the best I can.
I know I can't cook like her.

01:26:15.759 --> 01:26:19.559
It's Johnny. You're in danger.
Get out of the house.

01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:21.153
Where are you?

01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:23.961
You get to Milan.
I'm going to the travel agency.

01:26:28.204 --> 01:26:30.934
Come on, guys.
Get your coats on. Hurry up.

01:26:31.007 --> 01:26:33.737
I'm taking you
over to the neighbors'.

01:27:33.970 --> 01:27:37.167
- I feel fine. Thank you.
- You're in no condition to leave.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.504
Steve, you got my stuff?

01:27:39.576 --> 01:27:42.875
I want you to take Scotty to my
next-door neighbor and stay with him.

01:27:42.946 --> 01:27:46.177
- His mother will meet him there.
- What's going on?

01:27:46.249 --> 01:27:49.218
Give me the car keys. I want you
to listen to what I'm saying.

01:27:49.285 --> 01:27:51.719
Don't go into the house.
I'll meet you there later.

01:27:51.788 --> 01:27:54.382
Come on. Let's go.

01:29:19.142 --> 01:29:22.077
Thanks. What's this?

01:29:22.145 --> 01:29:23.737
Open it.

01:29:31.054 --> 01:29:33.545
Well, it's not my birthday.

01:29:36.659 --> 01:29:39.685
What did you do,
get me a Christmas present?

01:29:44.467 --> 01:29:46.059
Oh, my.

01:29:48.371 --> 01:29:50.168
This is Austrian, right?

01:29:53.009 --> 01:29:54.340
What's this...

01:29:56.512 --> 01:30:00.539
- Who are you?
- I'm Walter Henke.

01:30:17.834 --> 01:30:21.531
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States...

01:30:21.604 --> 01:30:24.937
and the General Secretary
of the Soviet Union.

01:31:11.921 --> 01:31:15.015
Today we stand on the verge of history.

01:31:15.091 --> 01:31:19.027
Our bleak and desperate past
is behind us.

01:31:19.095 --> 01:31:22.963
What greater gift can we give
to the children of the world?

01:31:23.032 --> 01:31:27.093
They will no longer have to live
with the terrors of nuclear holocaust.

01:33:30.359 --> 01:33:32.919
They got a sniper up there
trying to get the president.

01:33:32.995 --> 01:33:36.021
Get to the hotel. Get the Secret
Service. Stop the president.

01:33:43.172 --> 01:33:45.402
What the hell are you doing?

01:33:45.475 --> 01:33:47.409
Stay out of this!

01:33:47.477 --> 01:33:51.243
Wait till I drop
before you send me flowers, okay?

01:34:07.797 --> 01:34:10.595
So we'll have a great time
in the Big Apple.

01:35:18.634 --> 01:35:20.534
This is a setup.

01:35:20.603 --> 01:35:22.901
They never intended
to shoot the president from here.

01:35:22.972 --> 01:35:24.872
So who's he?

01:35:26.809 --> 01:35:28.834
That's the real Walter Henke.

01:35:28.911 --> 01:35:31.038
He's the patsy.

01:35:31.113 --> 01:35:34.082
It's supposed to look like
he got shot afterwards.

01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:36.243
There's gotta be somebody else here.

01:36:02.178 --> 01:36:04.442
Boyette's on the "L" platform.

01:36:08.284 --> 01:36:11.720
We have a photo opportunity
outside the hotel.

01:36:11.787 --> 01:36:15.120
Russian-Americans.
Mothers, babies.

01:36:15.191 --> 01:36:21.187
The television networks love the idea.
We can use it worldwide.

01:36:41.484 --> 01:36:44.282
- Delich.
- What are you doin' here?

01:36:44.353 --> 01:36:48.312
- How do you feel? I heard about...
- I asked you, what are you doing here?

01:36:49.525 --> 01:36:51.459
They got me assigned
for that president thing.

01:36:51.527 --> 01:36:54.963
Hold it. Stop.
Freeze, asshole!

01:37:06.575 --> 01:37:08.634
What's the matter with you?

01:37:35.871 --> 01:37:37.805
Ladies, please, step back.

01:37:59.562 --> 01:38:03.396
Watch it! Get out of the way!

01:38:03.466 --> 01:38:04.660
I'm sorry!

01:38:30.326 --> 01:38:32.260
Get some more men down here!

01:38:33.496 --> 01:38:35.726
Surround the car!

01:40:38.621 --> 01:40:40.145
He's dead.

01:40:41.657 --> 01:40:43.591
He one of your shadow warriors?

01:40:43.659 --> 01:40:47.527
- Get your goddamn hands off me.
- I ought to take your fuckin' head off!

01:40:47.596 --> 01:40:49.962
This was your operation
from the beginning.

01:40:50.032 --> 01:40:52.660
You killed General Carlson,
the whole thing.

01:40:52.735 --> 01:40:54.726
What operation, Sergeant?

01:40:54.803 --> 01:40:56.930
I don't see that
anything's happened here.

01:40:58.407 --> 01:41:00.932
- There's a body in there.
- Yeah.

01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:05.242
The body of a man you smuggled into
the country. If I were you, I'd run.

01:41:05.314 --> 01:41:09.614
Who are you working for, the Russians?
They hire you to kill one of their own?

01:41:09.685 --> 01:41:12.347
Or do you miss war so much
you're trying to start one by yourself?

01:41:12.421 --> 01:41:15.584
Hasn't been a world war in 50 years.
You ever wonder why?

01:41:15.658 --> 01:41:17.922
It's nuclear weapons.

01:41:17.993 --> 01:41:19.927
We want 'em, the Soviets want 'em.

01:41:19.995 --> 01:41:22.429
We? Who's we? A bunch of nutcases?

01:41:23.666 --> 01:41:25.600
If it wasn't for nuclear weapons...

01:41:25.668 --> 01:41:27.659
you'd be fighting Russians
in the streets of Washington.

01:41:27.736 --> 01:41:30.398
- I'll take my chances.
- You're a fool!

01:41:32.041 --> 01:41:34.874
We're in separate armies.
You know that, pal?

01:41:34.944 --> 01:41:39.074
But you're out in the light now, and
you're gonna be scurrying for the dark.

01:41:39.148 --> 01:41:41.946
And I'm gonna see
you get stepped on!

01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:50.258
You're a dead man, Sergeant.

01:42:07.509 --> 01:42:11.411
Worldwide joy surrounding the
Soviet-American Disarmament Treaty...

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.813
continued today, but on Capitol Hill
a more somber mood...

01:42:14.883 --> 01:42:18.751
as Army Sergeant John Gallagher
went before a closed-door session...

01:42:18.821 --> 01:42:20.755
of the House Intelligence Committee...

01:42:20.823 --> 01:42:23.189
to tell what he knows
about the bizarre plot...

01:42:23.258 --> 01:42:25.453
to assassinate
the Soviet general secretary...

01:42:25.527 --> 01:42:27.461
and prevent the signing of the pact.

01:42:27.529 --> 01:42:29.463
- It's over.
- Evidence to the plot...

01:42:29.531 --> 01:42:32.557
hatched by renegade Soviet
and American military leaders...

01:42:32.634 --> 01:42:35.728
surfaced only hours after
the treaty was finalized.

01:42:35.804 --> 01:42:39.399
Gallagher's information has already led
to the discovery of the bodies...

01:42:39.475 --> 01:42:42.672
of one and possibly two
of the would-be assassins.

01:42:42.745 --> 01:42:47.580
Sergeant Gallagher has also identified
still-missing Colonel Glen Whitacre...

01:42:47.649 --> 01:42:50.447
as one of the leaders
of the conspiracy.

01:42:50.519 --> 01:42:54.683
Intelligence officials vowed to pursue
all possible angles in the case...

01:42:54.757 --> 01:42:56.384
no matter where they may lead.

01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.127
What now?

01:43:13.208 --> 01:43:15.199
Why are we stopping, Sergeant?

01:43:17.046 --> 01:43:19.708
Sorry, sir.
Just checking the map.
