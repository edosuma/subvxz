WEBVTT

01:03.130 --> 01:05.532
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Two hands!

01:05.565 --> 01:07.801
You try and get that
any other way.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.805
Come down if you're not gonna
use two hands.

01:10.873 --> 01:12.808
Don't look!

01:12.874 --> 01:13.874
Turn around.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.910
Don't look!

01:19.312 --> 01:20.215
Clear?

01:20.248 --> 01:21.448
Yes!

01:21.516 --> 01:24.285
Well, it's not clear, is it,
because you're in my drop zone!

01:24.317 --> 01:25.985
Oh shit.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.991
She's a mean climber, eh?

01:32.993 --> 01:35.129
Yeah. She's been invited to
national tree-climbing comps

01:35.162 --> 01:36.829
- this weekend.
- Whoo!

01:38.099 --> 01:40.468
Hey, I'm gonna take Bear home
before I start the chipper up.

01:40.502 --> 01:41.403
Is that all right?

01:41.436 --> 01:42.571
Clean that up.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.836
Bear, come on. Last rounds.

02:06.193 --> 02:08.694
Oh my God! Oh my God. Whoo.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.031
Whoa.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.198
- Come here.
- I'm so sorry.

02:11.266 --> 02:13.699
Oh, you gave the poor woman
a fright, eh?

02:13.701 --> 02:15.102
- Come sit down.
- Yeah.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.606
What were you doing over there?

02:18.974 --> 02:20.976
OK.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.345
Oh. What are you?

02:25.379 --> 02:27.681
- I'm an arborist.
- Ah!

02:27.714 --> 02:31.550
- Cut trees down?
- No, more like prune trees.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.120
Well, you must cut some down.

02:33.154 --> 02:36.457
We try not to,
cos that's not... the job.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.391
Sorry, don't look at that.
It's not ready yet.

02:39.393 --> 02:42.163
We will be waiting
the full minute.

02:43.898 --> 02:46.534
- Are you looking at it?
- I-I can't see... any... Yeah.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.570
Well. Sorry.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.402
- OK.
- Yep.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.236
- All righty.
- All right.

02:51.238 --> 02:53.405
OK.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.708
Is that you?

02:54.742 --> 02:56.710
- Yes.
- Yep.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.480
- That you?
- Yup.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.980
Yep.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.915
Is that you?

03:01.917 --> 03:05.754
I have to do this.
So is this you? Full name?

03:05.821 --> 03:07.920
- Yeah.
- Great.

03:07.922 --> 03:10.157
OK. Let's have a look at this.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.425
Ah. OK.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.560
That is a positive result.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.427
You are pregnant.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.431
Congratulations.

03:20.101 --> 03:22.904
Tapeworm can cause
false-positive pregnancy tests.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.673
All the time. All the time.
Happens...

03:25.707 --> 03:27.606
heaps. You can google it.
It's quite a common thing.

03:27.608 --> 03:28.677
It's not a thing.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.778
Do I have tapeworm?
Am I pregnant? You know, it's...

03:30.845 --> 03:33.448
- And it's usually tapeworm.
- It's not a tapeworm.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.517
It's a baby.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.917
I think it is-
I think it is tapeworm.

03:36.952 --> 03:39.921
Hands up - who's the nurse here?

03:39.954 --> 03:41.957
OK? So, no heavy lifting.

03:42.891 --> 03:45.093
None of this, and none of this.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.627
All right?
You know what I'm saying?

03:46.695 --> 03:48.363
- Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
- OK.

03:48.397 --> 03:49.130
Bye. Thanks.

03:49.197 --> 03:51.633
- You did really well.
- Uh-huh.

03:58.906 --> 04:02.476
Oh, you're kidding.

04:16.992 --> 04:19.060
You got blood on you.
You scratch yourself?

04:19.093 --> 04:20.492
What?

04:20.494 --> 04:21.994
Yeah, yeah.

04:21.996 --> 04:23.998
It's fine. I'm fine.

04:29.402 --> 04:30.971
You were supposed
to take Bear home.

04:31.005 --> 04:32.639
What?

04:32.673 --> 04:35.410
Didn't you go home
to drop Bear off?

04:35.442 --> 04:37.344
Oh, yeah, he wanted to stay.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.413
Huh.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.837
Oh my God. Oh my God.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.605
Wild.

05:07.375 --> 05:11.544
Everyone here has a baby...
or has a baby inside them

05:11.546 --> 05:14.615
- or just is a baby.
- I know.

05:14.649 --> 05:16.518
Hey, what's inside that?

05:17.385 --> 05:20.221
- Oh, here you go.
- What?

05:22.555 --> 05:24.558
Pink.

05:25.961 --> 05:29.061
- Oh, thank God you're here.
- Molly, what's up?

05:29.063 --> 05:32.397
The baby showers and hen nights
are blurring together.

05:32.399 --> 05:35.301
Married, house, baby, done.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.904
They're gone. They're parents.

05:37.906 --> 05:39.974
- Yeah.
- It's just us now.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.072
- Hey, how was Thailand?
- Yeah, it was good.

05:43.074 --> 05:44.744
I stayed in a halfway house
for orphaned elephants.

05:44.812 --> 05:45.747
What are you up to?

05:45.813 --> 05:47.881
Uh, world tree climbing masters.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.216
True?

05:49.250 --> 05:50.985
What is that?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.988
Uh, you just climb a tree
as fast as you can.

05:53.021 --> 05:53.888
Wow.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.089
- Hi!
- Hey!

05:55.156 --> 05:56.757
- Hey!
- Thanks for coming.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.327
- Yeah.
- Can't wait to meet her.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.729
Or him. What's it gonna be?!

06:01.762 --> 06:02.928
Ah, we really don't mind,

06:02.930 --> 06:05.333
as long as our tiny human
is healthy.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.168
Giant box says
you kinda do mind.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.504
I'm kidding, kidding.

06:10.538 --> 06:11.839
- Joking.
- Oh my God.

06:11.873 --> 06:14.341
Did I tell you your dad
is delivering my baby?

06:14.375 --> 06:16.111
No. That's...

06:16.176 --> 06:18.111
Wow. That's so weird!

06:18.113 --> 06:20.348
No, are you kidding me?
He's amazing.

06:21.514 --> 06:24.618
So, uh, when are you two
having kids?

06:24.685 --> 06:27.118
Cos, seriously, it is the
best thing I've ever done.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.423
You haven't even
had the baby yet.

06:28.457 --> 06:30.125
You should have a baby
at the same time as us.

06:30.192 --> 06:32.126
- That would be so good!
- Yeah.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.428
- Have a baby.
- Well, you know what?

06:34.462 --> 06:37.466
I think we will now.
What do you reckon?

06:39.200 --> 06:41.535
Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it.
Right now.

06:41.569 --> 06:42.637
- Right now!
- Right... Right...

06:42.704 --> 06:43.805
- Right now?
- No, no, right now.

06:43.870 --> 06:44.971
- Right now.
- Right now.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.440
Yeah. Really? Yeah?

06:46.474 --> 06:49.310
- OK. Here.
- Here? Yeah. Yeah. Mmm. Mmm.

06:49.377 --> 06:50.779
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

06:50.812 --> 06:52.812
Mmm.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.983
Mmm!

06:55.050 --> 06:56.718
- Will you marry me?
- Absolutely not.

06:57.819 --> 06:59.287
In Tanzania,

06:59.320 --> 07:01.990
one in 20 women
die in childbirth.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.226
OK, everybody! Welcome, welcome.

07:06.260 --> 07:10.397
We're gonna do games soon, but
first, the big gender reveal.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.332
Come on, Mummy and Daddy!

07:13.334 --> 07:16.304
Oh, I'm so nervous! I'm shaking.

07:16.337 --> 07:17.837
OK.

07:17.904 --> 07:21.243
It's a girl!
Oh my God! I'm so happy!

07:21.276 --> 07:23.311
Oh, it's a girl!

07:23.344 --> 07:26.344
I said I didn't care, but I'm
really happy! Oh my God!

07:26.346 --> 07:28.183
How did you keep that a secret?

07:28.248 --> 07:31.151
Oh! Oh my God!
It's a little girl.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.351
I hate this shit.

07:33.353 --> 07:34.852
I'm gonna win all the games.

08:16.731 --> 08:17.964
Yeah!

08:17.998 --> 08:20.399
Yes! Yes, I won again!

08:20.401 --> 08:21.702
Tim!

08:22.902 --> 08:25.072
Hello.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.244
Hello.

08:32.413 --> 08:34.416
Oh.

09:15.690 --> 09:18.758
Whoo! I love presents.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.694
Is this yours, Molly? Cool.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.731
The wrapping is so funky.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.267
Wow!

09:27.301 --> 09:29.936
It's like a... blanket thing.

09:29.969 --> 09:32.373
It's from the charity in
Calcutta where I volunteered.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.807
Oh, thank you.
That's so beautiful.

09:34.809 --> 09:36.778
It's not. The mums and daughters
are trying to

09:36.810 --> 09:40.313
escape prostitution
by sewing for foreigners.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.719
Ooh, Nature Baby!
Love it.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.387
- Everything OK?
- Can we go?

09:47.421 --> 09:49.989
I hate it here.

09:49.991 --> 09:51.960
We just lost another two
of our friends.

10:08.276 --> 10:10.678
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.011
Why are you fondling fruit and
touching your stomach like that?

10:13.013 --> 10:15.349
I wasn't doing that.

10:15.416 --> 10:17.151
Do you wish you were pregnant?

10:18.585 --> 10:20.921
No. What?

10:20.954 --> 10:24.689
Jesus. You can't just slip that
in at Fruit World. No, I...

10:24.691 --> 10:26.927
I think I've got a parasite,
actually. Yeah.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.762
What from?

10:28.796 --> 10:32.266
I dunno. Molly's got a tapeworm
from South America once, so I...

10:32.299 --> 10:36.367
probably got it from
the dog park. I dunno.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.476
Really?

10:43.710 --> 10:46.180
You're picking very racist
fruits, actually.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.216
Ha ha

10:50.050 --> 10:53.186
- It's not a lettuce!
- Whoa, whoa, OK! I'm sorry!

10:53.219 --> 10:54.720
What...?

10:54.722 --> 10:56.190
What's going on?

10:56.224 --> 10:57.722
I'm really hungry,
and you're freaking me out!

10:57.724 --> 11:00.795
Well, here. Hey!
Here, eat something.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.231
Ugh.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.134
Don't do that!
Don't give me that.

11:08.169 --> 11:11.873
You always cry when I cry.
You always do that!

11:11.906 --> 11:13.875
Hey, hey, hey. It's OK.
What's going on?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.911
OK. I've got so much to do.
I'm an adventurous person,

11:16.977 --> 11:18.744
and I've done nothing.
I've done nothing.

11:18.746 --> 11:19.981
What are you talking about?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.081
You've got a big tree-climbing
comp in Taupo.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.083
I should've practised way more
for that.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.920
That was just supposed to be,
like, a fun weekend away.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.921
And it still will be
a fun weekend.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.090
We can go to Rotorua while
we're there - do the luge,

11:30.157 --> 11:33.326
the gondola, all the big ones,
cos-cos we're adventurous.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.432
I do wanna do Worlds.

11:38.499 --> 11:40.167
OK. Really?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.836
Yeah, yeah, this year,
in Canada. I wanna go.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.238
I wanna fly overseas,
and I wanna win something.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.575
I just... I just feel like
I'm not...

11:48.608 --> 11:51.744
living. You know, I'm a wild
person. We're wild people.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.080
- Yes!
- We gotta... you know!

11:53.113 --> 11:55.115
- We should do something wild!
- Yeah!

11:55.182 --> 11:56.683
- Yeah!
- OK.

11:56.718 --> 11:59.921
Well, if you qualify.
Which you will! I...

11:59.954 --> 12:00.785
- I'm in!
- Yeah?

12:00.787 --> 12:03.123
- Whoo!
- Yes! OK.

12:03.190 --> 12:06.526
Mud pools! That's another one.
Bungee jumping!

12:06.560 --> 12:08.459
What are you standing there for?
Come on. Come on!

12:08.461 --> 12:09.794
Yes! We're being reckless. Whoo!

12:09.796 --> 12:11.931
No, don't, don't. Leave it,
leave it. Just leave it.

12:11.964 --> 12:13.200
Come on!

12:13.233 --> 12:15.035
Come on.

12:16.804 --> 12:17.803
Welcome to the NZARB

12:17.805 --> 12:19.306
National Tree Climbing
Championships.

12:19.373 --> 12:22.142
Could all female climbers
attending the Work Climb

12:22.209 --> 12:24.311
please make your way to
tree number three? Thank you.

12:24.378 --> 12:26.113
Do you need anything?

12:26.147 --> 12:28.449
- Have you warmed up your hands?
- Yes.

12:28.482 --> 12:30.284
It's this tree over there.
Come on, come on. Let's go.

12:30.318 --> 12:33.654
- I'm gonna win!
- Let's go. Come on.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.055
Come on! You got this, Zo!

12:36.089 --> 12:38.124
Zoe, Zoe, Zoe...

12:38.158 --> 12:40.727
Competitor, when you're ready.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.631
Phew.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.668
Come on! Yes, Zo!

12:48.670 --> 12:50.738
Come on! Nice!

12:50.771 --> 12:52.004
You got this, Zo!

12:52.006 --> 12:53.640
Clear.

12:53.674 --> 12:56.007
Points for accuracy. Come on!

12:58.845 --> 13:00.849
Clear.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.117
Clear.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.589
Come on!

13:12.759 --> 13:14.093
Clear.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.263
Come on! You're almost there!
You got it!

13:19.432 --> 13:21.699
4.55. That's the fastest today.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.872
Yes, Zoe! Yes!

13:24.938 --> 13:26.874
Pretty good, I guess.

13:28.876 --> 13:31.278
And now the winner of the
women's Work Climb -

13:31.311 --> 13:33.680
long-time climber,
first-time competitor -

13:33.714 --> 13:36.048
give it up for Zoe Manase!

13:36.050 --> 13:37.685
Yay! Whoo!

13:37.719 --> 13:39.286
- Qualified for Worlds.
- Yay!

13:39.320 --> 13:40.854
There you go.
That's for you there.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.690
- Oh, thank you.
- No worries.

13:42.723 --> 13:44.726
Take a picture!

13:45.658 --> 13:47.127
- I, um-I just wanna-
- Oh, we're not-

13:47.161 --> 13:49.061
we're not doing speeches
this year.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.731
But I could pass on
anything you have to say.

13:51.733 --> 13:53.401
Yeah, well, just thanks for
everyone showing up.

13:53.467 --> 13:54.802
Thanks to everyone
for showing up.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.735
And also to
my fellow competitors.

13:56.737 --> 13:59.974
And also to her fellow
competitors. That's it.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.240
Yeah, whoo!

14:01.242 --> 14:04.577
One more time for Zoe Manase!

14:04.579 --> 14:06.914
Whoa.

14:06.980 --> 14:10.751
All right. Now time for
some adventure sports!

14:16.489 --> 14:20.260
You don't have to do this.
You can change your mind.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.593
What's wrong with you?

14:22.595 --> 14:24.597
Aren't you scared?

14:24.599 --> 14:27.066
Just hold on to me. It'll be
fine. I'll do the jumping.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.434
I thought you wouldn't
go through with it.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.936
I thought that if
I brought you up here,

14:30.938 --> 14:33.874
y-you would tell me
what was going on.

14:33.906 --> 14:35.108
What?

14:35.175 --> 14:37.578
- I'm not gonna let you do it.
- I'll do what I like, actually.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.179
Yeah, no shit, Zoe.

14:39.213 --> 14:41.683
- Let me feel your stomach.
- Wow! Wow. No, don't!

14:41.715 --> 14:44.417
Stop it! Stop it! Don't!
It's nothing to touch yet!

14:44.450 --> 14:46.119
What?

14:46.185 --> 14:48.089
And what does that mean?

14:48.122 --> 14:50.622
Why didn't you...?
How could you...?

14:50.624 --> 14:52.092
What did you...?

14:52.126 --> 14:53.958
What the fuck, Zoe?!

14:53.960 --> 14:55.930
Why would you... bungee jump?!

14:55.963 --> 14:57.598
I don't know, OK?

14:57.631 --> 14:59.297
I thought there was, like,
a grace period or something!

14:59.299 --> 15:01.035
I don't know!
You know how you can, like,

15:01.068 --> 15:02.970
park for five extra minutes
in the city? I don't know!

15:03.036 --> 15:04.470
- I don't know!
- I'm tellin' the man.

15:04.472 --> 15:08.640
Do not tell the man.
Don't you dare tell the man.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.777
Are you pregnant?

15:10.810 --> 15:11.976
Wow.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.449
That is so rude.

15:14.482 --> 15:16.550
- This is my normal tummy.
- Yes.

15:16.584 --> 15:18.818
You're lying to me
and the man now.

15:18.820 --> 15:19.985
That's a lot.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.821
No, no, no. Please don't.
Don't, don't! No, no, no! Stop!

15:22.823 --> 15:24.826
OK.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.491
Wow. Thanks

15:26.493 --> 15:29.564
OK, let's do it.
All the way to the edge.

15:31.766 --> 15:33.567
Are you sure it's OK not to do
a double tie-in? I-

15:33.599 --> 15:36.236
Yeah, man. Here we go. Five,

15:36.270 --> 15:38.272
four, three...

15:39.906 --> 15:41.307
You OK, man?

15:44.344 --> 15:46.345
Stop crying. He...

15:46.412 --> 15:48.513
I'm sorry.
He cries when I cry.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.085
Stop crying.
That's so embarrassing.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.184
Just don't look at me.
Just don't look at me!

15:53.186 --> 15:55.522
Just get back!
It's really dangerous!

15:55.589 --> 15:57.825
J-Just sit down
and don't come any closer.

15:57.858 --> 15:59.493
Just hurry up and jump!
Just do it!

15:59.526 --> 16:01.929
OK, this time. Five, four,

16:01.961 --> 16:03.864
three, two, one.

16:04.665 --> 16:06.868
You have... ruined it for me!

16:09.203 --> 16:11.305
Oh my God!

16:12.772 --> 16:15.041
- What the fuck?!
- You're so stupid!

16:15.108 --> 16:17.344
- It's not OK!
- I'm sorry.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.544
You can't just push someone
off the edge!

16:20.546 --> 16:25.451
Oh, you're banned for life!

16:25.485 --> 16:27.119
Are you OK?

16:27.153 --> 16:29.456
I'm gonna be a dad!

16:39.666 --> 16:41.133
We don't even have backpacks.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.570
Now, hurry up. Give me the test.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.642
Fuck, I wish I had, like,
20 leather bracelets.

16:47.675 --> 16:49.577
Tim.

16:50.411 --> 16:51.978
I already know
what it's gonna say.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.245
Well, I need to see it.

16:53.247 --> 16:56.317
I want the experience.
You left me out.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.192
Oh my God. Give it here.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.828
We're probably gonna
have a baby.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.928
I can't become one of those
pregnant women, Tim.

17:08.996 --> 17:11.095
What if I'm not me any more?

17:11.097 --> 17:12.498
Well, do you wanna
have a baby, then?

17:12.532 --> 17:16.601
I wanna have a baby. I just
don't wanna turn into a mum.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.773
I don't want us to become dicks,
you know?

17:18.838 --> 17:22.844
We won't.
Me and you will stay the same.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.113
H-How...

17:26.180 --> 17:28.548
How do you know you want a baby?

17:31.183 --> 17:34.120
I don't wanna not have a baby.

17:34.188 --> 17:36.190
Huh.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.124
Well, I don't...

17:38.190 --> 17:40.360
not wanna have a baby...

17:40.393 --> 17:42.395
either.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.304
It's too weird. It's so...
Don't. Way too close.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.942
I don't wanna miss it.

17:55.976 --> 17:57.478
God.

17:57.544 --> 18:02.313
You know being a dad
doesn't start with the peeing.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.815
Just don't look.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.486
Don't.

18:07.488 --> 18:12.125
This is the weirdest thing
you've asked me to do, ever.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.161
OK.

18:16.997 --> 18:18.966
It's so happy for us.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.169
Oh God.

18:21.936 --> 18:23.304
Ohh!

18:23.336 --> 18:25.638
Oh man!

18:25.672 --> 18:27.672
I can imagine you pregnant.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.242
It'll suit you.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.176
Let's see.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.180
Oh.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.016
What are you-
Oh, what are you doing?

18:39.018 --> 18:41.018
Can you at least do my face?

18:42.523 --> 18:44.525
I just...

18:46.192 --> 18:48.261
I peed on that. Don't...

18:48.295 --> 18:50.930
- Go tell the receptionist.
- I'm gonna tell everyone.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.135
- I love you.
- Love you.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.938
Perv.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.772
It says here at four weeks,

18:59.805 --> 19:02.109
our baby's the size
of a poppy seed.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.208
OK, no, concentrate.
Let's make a list of everything

19:04.210 --> 19:05.945
we need to do before
the baby comes.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.681
What is the wildest thing
you can think of?

19:08.715 --> 19:11.052
- Wildest thing.
- Yip. Buy a boat.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.853
Nice. OK, go bigger,
even bigger.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.387
A house. Should we buy a house?

19:15.389 --> 19:18.024
No, shush, shush, shush.
OK, I mean, like, adventurous,

19:18.057 --> 19:20.557
like, crazy, like, you know...

19:20.559 --> 19:24.396
Get a tattoo or... stay out
for two days straight. You know?

19:24.398 --> 19:27.635
Go dancing, like we used to do.
Or, you know,

19:27.668 --> 19:30.237
be a world champion of
competitive tree-climbing.

19:30.304 --> 19:32.571
I just came up with that off the
top of my head. That's great.

19:32.573 --> 19:33.572
Perfect.

19:33.574 --> 19:35.375
- We didn't used to go dancing.
- Yes, we did.

19:35.409 --> 19:38.411
- We... We never did that.
- Yes, we did. We did...

19:38.478 --> 19:39.712
all the time.

19:39.779 --> 19:45.249
OK. What is something you think
you're gonna regret not doing?

19:45.251 --> 19:47.421
I regret not doing drugs.

19:47.488 --> 19:49.422
I didn't mean to skip drugs.
Just no one ever offered.

19:49.489 --> 19:53.093
Well, don't write that down!
I'm not gonna start now, am I?

19:53.160 --> 19:54.592
Well...

19:54.594 --> 19:56.430
Or maybe just
one pill of ecstasy,

19:56.496 --> 19:58.732
in a-in a controlled
environment.

19:58.765 --> 20:02.436
Yeah, it's fine. It's on the
list. Next. Go. Come on.

20:02.501 --> 20:05.271
I'd like to stop doing dishes.
Just eat off disposable plates.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.606
My God, boring! So boring! Tim!

20:07.673 --> 20:10.610
I'm embarrassed for you right
now. Just anything. Anything.

20:10.678 --> 20:12.276
First thing that pops into
your mind. Bah! Go.

20:12.278 --> 20:15.181
A threesome with
your friend Molly.

20:17.718 --> 20:20.619
- Now, you made me say that.
- Why would she, Tim?

20:20.621 --> 20:22.955
Why would she?
That's...

20:22.957 --> 20:25.293
'Threesome with... Molly.'

20:27.460 --> 20:30.795
She's not even
my hottest friend.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.202
Zoe! Are you awake?

20:42.308 --> 20:44.810
I like these bracelets.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.785
Tim.

20:51.817 --> 20:53.819
Uh,... hi.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.486
How come you're here without me?

20:55.488 --> 20:59.058
I was going to the bathroom, and
then when I was on my way back,

20:59.093 --> 21:02.161
I just heard this loud music,
and I couldn't sleep.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.162
Me neither.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.330
I also wanted to take my
trophy out to celebrate.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.668
Can we go celebrate at a hotel?

21:07.734 --> 21:09.737
Stop making me boring.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.146
You're drinking for two now!

21:19.179 --> 21:23.348
One more!
One more! One more! One more!

21:25.250 --> 21:27.253
Whoo!

21:43.703 --> 21:46.272
What? Are you too drunk?

21:46.305 --> 21:48.275
No.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.210
No, it's just... Sorry.

21:51.277 --> 21:53.210
It's...

21:53.212 --> 21:57.383
It's like the baby knows.
I can't stop thinking about it.

21:57.450 --> 22:00.054
It's just a little speck.
It's not even a baby yet.

22:00.120 --> 22:04.525
Yeah, I know. It's just...
It's right there, though.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.459
I'm sorry.

22:13.732 --> 22:16.002
You're gonna be such a good mum.

22:17.071 --> 22:20.073
As soon as Speck divides
enough cells to grow ears,

22:20.140 --> 22:22.142
I'm gonna tell it that.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.225
Hey, Zo.

22:39.258 --> 22:40.326
What?

22:40.361 --> 22:42.363
Will you marry me?

22:44.096 --> 22:46.098
Not in a million years.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.102
You're so sweet.

22:50.938 --> 22:52.506
But after that?

22:53.606 --> 22:56.910
Yeah, after a million years.
Yeah, fine. Fuck you.

23:03.717 --> 23:06.387
I can't wait to tell
your parents.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.758
Why did you put a bun
in my mum's oven?

23:12.793 --> 23:14.762
- What?
- You're not. Are you?

23:14.795 --> 23:16.962
- That's what that is.
- That's not a bun. It's a bap!

23:17.029 --> 23:18.531
- Oh my gosh!
- I told you they were baps.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.299
Congratulations, guys.

23:20.301 --> 23:21.967
Oh, thank you.

23:21.969 --> 23:24.438
- Awesome.
- You're having a baby.

23:24.470 --> 23:28.541
I know. Yep, I'm pregnant, and
apparently, Tim made you mugs.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.477
Ta-da!

23:30.544 --> 23:32.112
Wow.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.212
Oh.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.648
Cool.

23:34.715 --> 23:35.549
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

23:35.615 --> 23:38.318
Well, we really shuffled
along the line.

23:38.384 --> 23:39.985
I don't think I want to
be called Nana.

23:39.987 --> 23:42.154
I think I'd like my own
special name,

23:42.221 --> 23:44.322
one that doesn't make me sound
so much like a grandma.

23:44.324 --> 23:47.324
Yeah, same, same.
Uh, what's Samoan for coach?

23:47.326 --> 23:49.160
- Uh, Faiaoga.
- Absolutely not.

23:49.162 --> 23:52.966
- Faiaoga.
- No. That's not happening.

23:52.998 --> 23:53.834
Wow.

23:53.901 --> 23:55.301
Will you deliver the baby, Sefa?

23:55.334 --> 23:57.470
Oh my God, Tim, no! What?

23:57.504 --> 23:59.338
- Ew, Tim!
- No. You definitely cannot be

23:59.340 --> 24:00.807
your own daughter's
obstetrician, Tim.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.843
Gross!

24:04.444 --> 24:06.479
Did they do a transvaginal
ultrasound?

24:06.513 --> 24:10.083
Do not say 'vaginal' again,
ever again, please. It's gross.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.017
- Ooh.
- No.

24:11.084 --> 24:12.753
- Oh my God. Rude.
- You can't eat that. No.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.787
No cured meats.

24:16.189 --> 24:19.258
- So, how far along are you?
- Yeah, what's your LMP?

24:19.292 --> 24:22.996
- I don't know what that means.
- Last menstrual period.

24:23.028 --> 24:25.098
No. Don't say these words.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.504
Hmm. Just can't really
imagine you pregnant.

24:30.537 --> 24:33.672
You know? Sort of doesn't
suit you or something.

24:33.707 --> 24:36.443
Why? Cos I drive a truck
and climb trees?

24:36.476 --> 24:37.945
Kind of.

24:37.978 --> 24:40.279
Was... Was it an accident?

24:40.313 --> 24:42.449
You think all babies are
accidents because I was.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.215
You were not
an accident, Zoe.

24:44.217 --> 24:46.353
Mm

24:46.385 --> 24:48.386
Oh, you look like
you're gonna be sick.

24:48.388 --> 24:50.791
- Mm.
- No, you're not.

24:50.824 --> 24:52.556
- Mm.
- Yes, you are.

24:54.393 --> 24:57.363
Not on the good rug, darling.

24:57.396 --> 24:58.398
Pretty good at denial.

24:58.465 --> 25:00.398
That's why she's not
afraid of anything.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.968
She's not feeling
the right feelings.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.805
Well, she's not acting like
your regular pregnant woman.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.705
Well, how should
a pregnant woman be?

25:06.739 --> 25:08.909
I dunno. How should a dad be?

25:11.074 --> 25:12.546
Well, how should a dad be?
I haven't got one of them,

25:12.578 --> 25:14.912
so you just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.983
Look, you don't need a dad
to be a good dad, OK?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.918
Your main job is just to cope
and not go travelling,

25:19.920 --> 25:22.421
because that is ridiculous.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.089
Listen, Tim,
I'm basically your dad.

25:24.091 --> 25:26.559
I love you, and there's no need
to talk about it.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.927
Oh, look.

25:28.929 --> 25:32.432
Still works. It's cool.

25:32.498 --> 25:34.500
I don't want this stuff.

25:36.335 --> 25:38.403
I only want this.

25:45.612 --> 25:47.614
Ow!

25:55.055 --> 25:57.056
- Are you happy now?
- Yip.

26:00.692 --> 26:03.961
Oh wow.

26:05.198 --> 26:07.434
That's our baby.

26:07.467 --> 26:09.133
That's Speck.

26:09.135 --> 26:11.137
OK. All done.

26:12.139 --> 26:13.273
Do you wanna know the sex?

26:13.305 --> 26:15.042
- Yes.
- No.

26:15.075 --> 26:17.976
Oh, uh, I don't wanna know
if you don't wanna know.

26:17.978 --> 26:19.979
It's up to you.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.982
I'll write it down for you.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.319
Putting it in here.

26:28.321 --> 26:32.326
So, you're in at 27 weeks,
so well over halfway now.

26:33.660 --> 26:36.330
Uh, no, no, no, no.
That's a mistake,

26:36.395 --> 26:39.666
cos, uh, well,
we only just got pregnant.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.834
Oh.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.502
Well, this is pretty full-on
for you guys, eh?

26:44.504 --> 26:45.805
That's actually-
That's not possible.

26:45.838 --> 26:49.508
Cos that would mean that we were
having a baby in-in-in...

26:49.575 --> 26:51.243
- Really soon!
- Yep.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.246
Oh... shit!

26:53.279 --> 26:54.981
Can you check it again?
I think you might be wrong,

26:55.015 --> 26:57.084
so could you do some...?
I don't know what you...

26:57.116 --> 27:00.086
It's fine. It's actually fine,
because the tree-climbing Worlds

27:00.120 --> 27:02.155
- are before the due date.
- We only have one bedroom!

27:02.189 --> 27:03.854
We just have to find someone
to dog-sit Bear.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.325
Then we can make half our room a
nursery. We'll put up a curtain.

27:06.359 --> 27:07.861
And then-
And then that's two rooms.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.496
We're not doing any of that.

27:09.528 --> 27:11.964
Oh my God, blink. Please blink.

27:22.142 --> 27:24.177
Take the day off.

27:24.209 --> 27:25.946
What?

27:25.978 --> 27:27.514
You can't do that tree
without me.

27:27.546 --> 27:30.450
Well, Sonny's around.
Look, just-just go and nap.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.185
Eat for two. It's my job
to take care of you now.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.221
Ew. No, it isn't.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.125
I don't wanna just hang at home
by myself.

27:39.159 --> 27:42.896
You'll have a baby soon.
You'll never be alone again.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.697
That's such a messed up thing
to say.

27:44.730 --> 27:46.565
Come on, Bear.

27:46.632 --> 27:48.634
Seriously.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.642
Come on, Sonny.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.409
Far, that's pretty high, eh.

27:57.477 --> 27:59.076
We believe in you.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.546
You said trees can kill you
if you're not concentrating.

28:01.581 --> 28:04.017
Well, you better concentrate.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.418
I can't let you climb.

28:07.420 --> 28:09.421
OK. The rule is
if you were doing it

28:09.488 --> 28:11.723
before you were pregnant,
you keep doing it.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.160
Your harness isn't even fitting.

28:13.192 --> 28:17.396
- OK, well, then give me yours.
- No. You could easily fall.

28:17.430 --> 28:18.765
If you're grounding me,
you can go fu-

28:18.832 --> 28:20.834
You're grounded.

28:22.768 --> 28:25.070
I should never have told you
I was pregnant.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.438
You didn't.

28:32.944 --> 28:35.180
Hey! Get down, right now!

28:35.215 --> 28:38.252
You are in a delicate condition!

28:38.285 --> 28:40.753
Zoe, this is not OK!

28:40.786 --> 28:43.523
If you go any higher,...
you're fired.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.122
I don't care if you fire me.
I'm going away.

28:46.124 --> 28:48.458
You can't go to Worlds pregnant!

28:48.460 --> 28:50.294
I can do anything pregnant.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.031
Come down now.

28:52.065 --> 28:54.033
I do not wanna have to do
an aerial rescue today.

28:54.066 --> 28:57.302
Ooh, you'd love that,
wouldn't you?

28:59.639 --> 29:03.610
Even if I needed rescuing,
I wouldn't let you.

29:03.642 --> 29:05.645
Whoo!

29:13.052 --> 29:15.155
You can't get down, can ya?

29:18.725 --> 29:20.727
Bro, can I get down?

29:31.336 --> 29:33.673
Chur, my bro. Congratulations.

29:33.739 --> 29:35.674
That's solid
you're having a baby.

29:35.741 --> 29:39.011
Far. Wish youse were my parents.
My parents are arseholes.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.647
- Yeah, my dad's an arsehole.
- How come?

29:41.680 --> 29:44.151
Well, he didn't wanna be a dad.

29:44.183 --> 29:45.017
Do you remember him?

29:45.084 --> 29:46.486
I just remember him
not being there.

29:46.519 --> 29:48.854
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

29:48.921 --> 29:51.324
my mum didn't even turn up to
the meeting with the principal.

29:51.356 --> 29:52.524
Far.

29:52.624 --> 29:56.094
She was supposed to fight for me
to not get kicked out of school.

29:56.129 --> 29:57.863
Hey, um, I was wondering
maybe if you and Zoe

29:57.930 --> 30:00.800
can go talk to the
principal with me.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.935
I don't wanna go by myself.

30:03.969 --> 30:07.371
I don't know if that's a good
idea. It should be your mum.

30:07.373 --> 30:10.442
I'll take you, Sonny.
Tim's a fucking pussy!

30:10.477 --> 30:12.445
Nah, nah, all good.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.378
I don't even wanna go back
to school anyways.

30:16.650 --> 30:18.651
Uh, Tim,...

30:19.452 --> 30:21.387
what is that?

30:21.453 --> 30:25.459
I told 'em you were stuck.

30:34.334 --> 30:36.568
Can you just hurry up?
I need to go bathroom.

30:36.635 --> 30:39.873
Zoe, don't climb trees
while you're pregnant.

30:39.905 --> 30:41.405
Get in the bucket, eh? Come on.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.573
Your bucket's cheating, mate.
Get some muscles and some rope.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.744
Yeah, come on, tree rat.
Get out of there. Get in here.

30:45.746 --> 30:47.881
Yep, OK. I just can't.
No, don't.

30:47.913 --> 30:49.081
Don't. Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

30:49.149 --> 30:51.316
Oh my God! Oh my God,
you're weeing on me!

30:51.351 --> 30:53.085
- Why are you weeing on me?
- I told you not to touch me!

30:53.152 --> 30:54.755
God. Oh my God.
It's getting everywhere!

30:54.821 --> 30:57.323
Jesus! I've got your pee on me.
Get in the bucket.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.492
- Yep. I'm sorry.
- That is piss. This is piss.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.758
Hey, mate, can you get something

31:01.760 --> 31:03.663
to clean up your girlfriend's
piss, please?

31:03.697 --> 31:05.095
Thanks, Steve.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.099
Unbelievable.

31:39.199 --> 31:41.200
Tim, do you copy?

31:42.401 --> 31:44.468
Got my ears on.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.472
Copy.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.308
My location is...

31:50.642 --> 31:52.645
tree.

31:58.817 --> 32:01.052
Amazing signal.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.390
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.724
Aren't you a bit tired of
just being so responsible

32:05.757 --> 32:08.894
all the time? It's like you're
obsessed with being a dad.

32:08.929 --> 32:10.830
Well,
when the leaves start falling

32:10.896 --> 32:13.933
off that tree,
we're gonna have a baby.

32:18.403 --> 32:20.073
And what's gonna happen?

32:20.105 --> 32:22.174
Shall we get married?

32:22.241 --> 32:23.675
No.

32:23.742 --> 32:26.478
You nearly got me then.
That was good.

32:26.513 --> 32:28.012
I have a very important question
for you.

32:28.014 --> 32:31.584
Tim, would you do me the honour
of joining me this evening

32:31.617 --> 32:35.519
for the craziest night
of your life? Over.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.523
I'm OK, thanks.

32:38.691 --> 32:40.693
Over and out.

32:45.265 --> 32:47.267
It's on the list.

34:08.847 --> 34:12.184
Shall we look at the
yellow piece of paper?

34:31.303 --> 34:35.273
Why do you have that jacket on?
Aren't you hot?

34:35.306 --> 34:36.375
What?

34:36.408 --> 34:38.143
- Aren't you hot?
- No.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.814
No. I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.679
You're kidding.

35:35.868 --> 35:37.871
Ohh, gotta piss.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.623
Y-You OK?

36:05.897 --> 36:07.533
Sorry.

36:09.669 --> 36:11.203
What are you doing?

36:11.236 --> 36:13.872
- Whoo!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

36:13.906 --> 36:15.573
Stop it!

36:15.575 --> 36:17.741
Stop! Stop!

36:17.743 --> 36:18.878
Stop.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.997
Zoe! Come in!

36:44.837 --> 36:46.839
Zoe!

36:49.107 --> 36:51.276
Whoo!

36:53.346 --> 36:55.114
Gotta tell you something.

36:55.181 --> 36:57.183
What?

36:58.384 --> 37:00.386
I'm pregnant.

37:06.459 --> 37:08.125
Oh.

37:08.127 --> 37:10.130
Whoa. I thought...

37:11.462 --> 37:13.466
Really?

37:14.968 --> 37:16.969
No.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.469
I'm joking.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.805
Oh!

37:20.872 --> 37:23.141
Thank God.

37:23.209 --> 37:24.710
Yeah.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.476
I felt like I was gonna cry.

37:26.478 --> 37:29.815
No, me and Tim are going away
is what I was gonna tell you.

37:29.881 --> 37:32.982
I qualified for the World
Tree Climbing Comps, so...

37:32.984 --> 37:34.484
going overseas.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.487
Oh, that's so great.

37:37.890 --> 37:41.161
You always wanted to go away,
and you never did.

37:41.227 --> 37:43.495
Oh man. I really thought
you were pregnant.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.564
No. God.

37:46.332 --> 37:48.334
Imagine that.

37:51.671 --> 37:54.006
Can I have your jacket?
It's pretty cold, eh.

37:56.109 --> 37:58.078
No.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.682
No. No, no, no, Molly.
No, no, no! Oh!

38:17.797 --> 38:19.165
What are you doing?

38:19.198 --> 38:21.031
Nothing.

38:21.033 --> 38:23.699
Uh, uh, h-how was your night?

38:23.701 --> 38:25.270
- Um...
- What are you watching?

38:25.303 --> 38:26.870
Nothing.

38:26.872 --> 38:27.939
Give it here!

38:27.973 --> 38:29.976
Give me your computer.

38:32.645 --> 38:34.879
I am a vessel
for life.

38:34.881 --> 38:37.283
Oh my God.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.384
- Are you getting off on this?
- I'm preparing.

38:39.451 --> 38:43.388
Why can't you just watch porn
like a normal person?

38:43.455 --> 38:45.390
I almost wish
you were wanking to this.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.893
This is what
my body was designed for.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.629
- Ugh.
- Do not look at my history!

38:49.661 --> 38:52.228
- Hey!
- It's so weird. It's so weird!

38:52.230 --> 38:54.200
One of us has to get ready.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.803
When are you gonna stop taking
work so we can go away?

38:56.835 --> 38:59.904
I'm not. Dads are meant to
provide for their families,

38:59.906 --> 39:03.076
and we are having a baby,
in case you forgot.

39:03.142 --> 39:05.812
I can't forget. I-
It's literally in me.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.078
We are not going away, Zo.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.648
Uh, yes, we are, Tim.
We're going away,

39:08.681 --> 39:10.650
because we've got two months
to finish the list.

39:10.683 --> 39:11.885
Well, there was six months
at the start

39:11.917 --> 39:13.585
- that you didn't tell me about!
- That is not my fault!

39:13.652 --> 39:15.655
Speck was hiding.

39:25.263 --> 39:28.166
Did you clean the whole house?

39:28.200 --> 39:30.203
Yeah.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.739
Are you nesting?

39:33.772 --> 39:35.707
No.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.344
We're finishing that list, Tim.

39:38.377 --> 39:41.080
I've got so much stuff to do
before the baby comes,

39:41.114 --> 39:42.948
and you're really not helping.

39:43.015 --> 39:45.750
Are you in?
Because you said you were in.

39:45.783 --> 39:48.618
We can do yours first
if you want.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.622
You look so tired.

39:52.892 --> 39:54.458
I'm glowing.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.463
I am fucking radiant.

40:31.497 --> 40:34.600
ZOE, INSIDE: Just take half
if you want.

40:57.089 --> 40:59.424
Hi, Tim. How are you?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.460
Uh...

41:05.297 --> 41:07.196
I'm good.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.031
- Yeah?
- I'll get the watch.

41:39.064 --> 41:40.563
Hang on. Yeah.

41:40.565 --> 41:42.301
- Ow, ow.
- Sorry.

41:42.335 --> 41:44.237
Yeah. Yeah.

41:44.303 --> 41:45.738
OK.

41:45.805 --> 41:47.739
- Kiss. Yeah.
- OK.

41:50.174 --> 41:52.178
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

41:53.911 --> 41:55.915
Me too.

41:56.582 --> 41:58.585
Mmm.

42:04.422 --> 42:06.089
Mm.

42:07.926 --> 42:10.596
Yeah.

42:12.431 --> 42:14.834
- Mm. Yep.
- Yep.

42:16.167 --> 42:18.669
They're off.

42:18.703 --> 42:20.939
- Oh. Ow.
- Sorry.

42:21.006 --> 42:22.941
Yeah, let's go. Let's go.

42:27.846 --> 42:29.415
Mm!

42:29.448 --> 42:31.451
Oh my God.

42:32.618 --> 42:35.688
Oh my God. You are pregnant.

42:36.788 --> 42:39.124
I thought you were just
getting fat.

42:39.190 --> 42:41.026
Why are you guys trying to have
a threesome when you're about

42:41.058 --> 42:43.292
to be a mum and dad?
That is so twisted.

42:43.294 --> 42:45.263
The baby won't know. We were
just trying to do everything

42:45.297 --> 42:47.366
we wanted to before the baby
comes. It's not a big deal.

42:47.399 --> 42:48.632
You lied to me!

42:48.634 --> 42:50.369
- It's not her fault.
- OK, only because

42:50.402 --> 42:53.306
you stop being friends with our
friends when they have babies.

42:53.372 --> 42:54.971
- Now we can't be friends!
- That's because

42:54.973 --> 42:57.276
parents only wanna be friends
with other parents.

42:57.308 --> 42:58.209
I'm so sorry, Molly.

42:58.243 --> 42:59.478
Best of luck for the future,
guys.

42:59.544 --> 43:01.212
Why can't you just pretend
to be delighted for me?

43:01.245 --> 43:04.616
- You don't seem delighted.
- I'm-I'm really delighted!

43:04.649 --> 43:05.950
Were you just gonna
pop out a baby

43:05.984 --> 43:09.154
and then keep it from me
forever?

43:09.221 --> 43:10.656
You're a baby.

43:10.721 --> 43:12.656
You're a baby having a baby.

43:12.658 --> 43:14.393
- Don't you want kids one day?
- No!

43:14.426 --> 43:17.495
Cos it is the worst thing that
you could do for the planet.

43:17.562 --> 43:20.399
Yeah, well, what if your baby
solves climate change?

43:20.433 --> 43:22.635
Shut up, Zoe.

43:22.667 --> 43:25.404
You catch
so many planes.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.962
Hey.

43:55.968 --> 43:57.969
Mmm.

44:10.149 --> 44:11.951
Thought you would've still been
interested in having sex

44:11.984 --> 44:13.986
with just me.

44:18.890 --> 44:22.627
You know, some guys have
pregnancy fetishes...

44:22.660 --> 44:24.663
and actually like it.

44:25.897 --> 44:29.301
Stop being so respectful.
It's...

44:30.736 --> 44:32.203
I don't want you to look at me
like I'm the mother

44:32.236 --> 44:34.406
- of your child.
- Why-Why can't I?

44:34.473 --> 44:37.209
- You are.
- I'm trying to be myself still.

44:37.243 --> 44:38.578
Is that why you just tried
to have a threesome

44:38.643 --> 44:41.479
with your best friend
and you've got lipstick on?

44:41.513 --> 44:43.516
You've gone mental, Zoe.

44:46.018 --> 44:48.554
I only did that for you.
That's what you wanted.

44:48.587 --> 44:51.656
Just-Just go away.
Leave me alone.

44:51.690 --> 44:54.259
I have to wait
till this E wears off.

44:54.326 --> 44:56.763
Nobody calls it E any more, Tim.

45:37.469 --> 45:39.136
- Hi. Hi.
- Hey.

45:39.138 --> 45:40.973
Oh, you're pregnant too.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.475
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, thank you.

45:43.542 --> 45:46.476
You're not special.
Everybody's pregnant.

45:46.478 --> 45:48.312
So, I've got a neat little
checklist for you guys

45:48.379 --> 45:50.480
to check off
before baby arrives.

45:50.482 --> 45:53.315
The baby. And also,
we don't need that,

45:53.317 --> 45:58.556
because all we need from you
today is just the plane note.

45:58.589 --> 46:01.294
Uh, no, not in your
third trimester.

46:02.426 --> 46:05.663
OK, you two, why don't we
have a look at a birth plan?

46:05.730 --> 46:07.565
Already got one.

46:07.598 --> 46:10.835
I was thinking, uh, chocolate
fountain, fairy lights,

46:10.902 --> 46:14.640
you know, just, like,
fireworks... on standby outside.

46:14.674 --> 46:17.409
A glitter bomb, so as soon as
the baby comes out...

46:17.442 --> 46:20.145
Oh, Sonny has, like,
his hip-hop dance group

46:20.178 --> 46:21.980
he's part of, so we could
get them involved,

46:22.013 --> 46:23.346
get them to choreograph
something.

46:23.348 --> 46:25.183
And I was also thinking
it would be nice

46:25.250 --> 46:26.819
if you could dress up
a little bit,

46:26.852 --> 46:28.020
make a little bit of an effort.

46:28.087 --> 46:31.189
Zoe, there's, uh, something
called pregnancy negation.

46:31.256 --> 46:34.859
A lot of women suffer from, sort
of, severe adjustment issues.

46:34.926 --> 46:39.431
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. She-She's
got that. She has that thing.

46:39.464 --> 46:44.702
You cannot fly after 30 weeks
without a medical note.

46:44.770 --> 46:47.873
Yeah, we're gonna need
that note today.

46:52.877 --> 46:55.379
- Why don't I give you-
- My uncle is dying.

46:55.381 --> 46:57.350
Is he?

46:58.149 --> 47:00.619
- In Canada.
- In Canada, right.

47:04.723 --> 47:07.058
I thought that plan was good.

47:26.011 --> 47:27.478
Bear.

47:30.015 --> 47:32.484
Aw. Wanna come too, Bear?

47:37.355 --> 47:39.589
OK, everyone,
let's take a seat, please.

47:39.591 --> 47:41.660
We're about to begin
a magical journey

47:41.694 --> 47:46.098
into what is the rest of your
lives on what we call...

47:46.163 --> 47:48.399
the train to parenthood.

47:48.433 --> 47:50.835
Everyone at the station, please.

47:52.103 --> 47:56.105
Take a seat. Sit in a chair.
We're on a tight schedule here.

47:56.107 --> 47:57.743
It's nine months.

47:57.776 --> 48:01.279
As I said, there are
no dumb questions, all right?

48:01.346 --> 48:02.348
Chances are,

48:02.413 --> 48:06.685
if you're thinking it,
soe else here is as well.

48:06.718 --> 48:07.852
All right, birthing partners,

48:07.886 --> 48:10.355
you're gonna wanna take
this ball and roll it

48:10.388 --> 48:12.257
on their lower back.

48:12.290 --> 48:14.859
- Are you just here by yourself?
- No, no, she's meeting me here.

48:14.893 --> 48:17.796
She's, um... She's on her way.
Sorry.

48:17.863 --> 48:20.632
All right. That ball there,
the counterpressure

48:20.700 --> 48:24.134
will help alleviate your
birth partner's back pain

48:24.136 --> 48:25.770
during the labour.

48:25.803 --> 48:27.638
Do you have a support person?

48:27.640 --> 48:28.971
Oh, he's not coming.

48:28.973 --> 48:31.306
Right, OK. So there's
no one here with you.

48:31.308 --> 48:32.808
- No.
- OK, cool. Lean forward.

48:32.810 --> 48:36.312
I'll be your partner. Everyone
up, please. Bit of enthusiasm.

48:36.314 --> 48:39.617
You're about to bring a miracle
into this world.

48:39.651 --> 48:42.120
- So, sorry, you're all alone?
- Yeah, yeah.

48:42.154 --> 48:44.321
Just in this whole process
by yourself?

48:44.323 --> 48:45.991
- Yeah.
- Do you have some savings

48:46.058 --> 48:48.226
- or something?
- A little bit.

48:48.259 --> 48:50.429
Mm, K. That won't be enough.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.500
Thanks for helping me out
today, Zoe,

48:58.502 --> 49:00.405
especially since Mum
couldn't make it.

49:00.439 --> 49:04.343
Of course. This is important.
I've got your back.

49:06.011 --> 49:08.980
- What are you supposed to be?
- Your mum.

49:09.015 --> 49:12.015
You look nothing like my mum...
or anyone's mum.

49:12.017 --> 49:14.752
Shut up, dick.
These are my mum's clothes.

49:14.786 --> 49:16.754
Just be you.

49:16.788 --> 49:20.325
Just let me do
all the talking, OK?

49:28.799 --> 49:30.803
Hello.

49:34.705 --> 49:36.674
Hello.

49:36.709 --> 49:41.210
I'm sorry it's taken us so long
to... speak to each other,

49:41.212 --> 49:44.783
but as you can see,
I am... heavy with young.

49:44.817 --> 49:47.386
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

49:49.620 --> 49:50.855
Sonny,

49:50.890 --> 49:54.859
when you shove Mr Bennett
down H Block stairs...

49:54.893 --> 49:57.730
and give him a head injury,...

49:57.796 --> 50:01.533
you're telling me that you
don't wanna be at school.

50:01.567 --> 50:03.735
Nah, I do, Miss.

50:03.801 --> 50:05.734
- He was giving me shit.
- Don't say shit.

50:05.736 --> 50:08.072
Don't say shit.

50:08.140 --> 50:10.741
My understanding of the
situation is that Mr Bennett

50:10.808 --> 50:12.643
made fun of Sonny in class

50:12.678 --> 50:14.478
for not being able
to read something.

50:14.511 --> 50:17.080
And that could've been
an accident, yeah?

50:17.082 --> 50:20.219
I mean, many questions I have -
why was Mr Bennett

50:20.252 --> 50:23.754
standing at the top of
the stairs at lunchtime?

50:23.756 --> 50:27.757
You know, what kind of shoes
was he wearing?

50:27.759 --> 50:30.594
- I have an owl theory.
- You victim-blaming Mr Bennett?

50:30.661 --> 50:32.531
No. No.

50:33.665 --> 50:37.835
My point is that my son does not
deserve to be humiliated

50:37.868 --> 50:42.673
in a classroom by a teacher
whose job it is to nurture him.

50:42.707 --> 50:45.910
Well, he can come back.
We probably would've let him

50:45.944 --> 50:48.944
if his mum had come
to the board meeting.

50:48.946 --> 50:50.348
Me.

50:50.381 --> 50:53.518
No, his real mum.
You're not his mother.

50:55.453 --> 50:57.455
- Yes.
- No.

51:00.959 --> 51:03.361
- Yes.
- No.

51:03.395 --> 51:05.127
Sonny is my son,

51:05.129 --> 51:07.132
and this will be his...

51:08.466 --> 51:10.468
sibling, in here.

51:12.069 --> 51:14.304
- Nah.
- How can you be sure?

51:14.306 --> 51:18.141
Well, you see, you do a lot of
work experience for us,

51:18.143 --> 51:21.413
and you are known as
the tree woman, so...

51:25.884 --> 51:28.554
I am pregnant.
That-That is true.

51:28.587 --> 51:30.489
I can see that.

51:31.323 --> 51:32.623
Well, I'm glad
we cleared this up.

51:32.658 --> 51:34.393
Me too.

51:34.426 --> 51:36.428
Thank you.

51:37.328 --> 51:39.731
- See ya, Sonny.
- See ya, Miss.

51:48.239 --> 51:49.975
Here.

51:50.007 --> 51:52.011
Colour this in for me.

51:56.080 --> 51:58.849
- Can you pass the purple?
- Yeah.

51:58.917 --> 51:59.985
Thanks.

52:00.018 --> 52:01.319
Sorry, I'm Tim.

52:01.352 --> 52:02.853
Oh, Beth.

52:02.921 --> 52:04.924
- Nice to meet ya.
- You too.

52:06.857 --> 52:10.359
I think it's really cool that
you came by yourself.

52:10.361 --> 52:13.097
I just went through
a big break-up.

52:13.131 --> 52:15.364
Gotta do what's best
for baby, eh?

52:15.366 --> 52:17.369
The baby.

52:17.803 --> 52:19.805
Yeah.

52:31.549 --> 52:35.217
I needed you to be
at that antenatal class.

52:35.219 --> 52:38.122
I had to be partners with
someone who was...

52:38.156 --> 52:40.159
- What?
- ...not you.

52:41.292 --> 52:45.296
Why couldn't you just come,
for me? Where were you?

52:48.567 --> 52:50.732
What's this?

52:50.734 --> 52:52.738
Tickets.

52:57.808 --> 53:00.312
Why-? Why would you-?
Why do you always-?

53:00.346 --> 53:02.581
We're not settling down, OK?
We're going travelling.

53:02.647 --> 53:05.580
- I'm gonna go to Worlds!
- No, you're not!

53:05.582 --> 53:07.417
Can you get a refund
on these tickets?

53:07.419 --> 53:09.754
Well, I can get one
on your ticket.

53:37.549 --> 53:40.616
You can't keep acting
like nothing's changed.

53:40.618 --> 53:43.022
I'll do what I want, actually.

53:44.790 --> 53:46.925
This has to stop!

53:46.959 --> 53:49.761
Look, I get that you wish
you could still climb trees

53:49.794 --> 53:53.464
and go to Worlds, but you're
risking our baby's life!

53:53.531 --> 53:55.299
You have to stop.

53:55.301 --> 53:57.701
We're supposed to be living
our dreams together.

53:57.734 --> 54:00.439
- You said we would.
- No, my dream

54:00.471 --> 54:03.040
is to have a family - with you!

54:03.073 --> 54:06.477
And maybe just be a bit boring
and grown-up.

54:08.647 --> 54:11.950
I know you hate being pregnant.
I wish I could do it for you,

54:11.982 --> 54:14.819
because you are
fucking so bad at it.

54:16.654 --> 54:20.991
You think you're gonna be
such a good dad, but you're not.

54:21.058 --> 54:23.161
Dads turn into their dads.

54:25.163 --> 54:27.332
What-What are you doing?!

54:27.399 --> 54:29.401
Bear! No!

54:29.433 --> 54:30.500
No!

54:33.437 --> 54:35.006
Oh!

54:35.073 --> 54:37.674
Bear! Bear!

54:37.676 --> 54:39.674
Bear!

54:42.913 --> 54:44.917
Bear!

54:45.450 --> 54:47.453
Bear! Bear!

54:55.093 --> 54:58.161
Boy, what a big jump!
What a big jump!

54:58.196 --> 54:59.498
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

54:59.531 --> 55:02.267
- How-How is he OK?!
- I have no idea!

55:03.868 --> 55:06.504
What is wrong with you?

55:06.538 --> 55:08.373
Well, why did you have
to say that to me?!

55:08.439 --> 55:10.205
Why didn't you just
catch the ball?!

55:10.207 --> 55:13.544
Why didn't you just not
almost kill Bear?!

55:16.881 --> 55:19.049
Come on, Bear. Come on.

55:19.051 --> 55:21.687
Come on. Come on. Come on.

55:21.719 --> 55:23.555
Come on.

55:28.127 --> 55:30.129
What is that?

55:40.404 --> 55:42.408
I don't need your help.

55:43.408 --> 55:45.143
I don't think you need me
at all.

55:45.176 --> 55:46.477
I don't.

55:46.511 --> 55:50.482
Well, you have our baby
by yourself, then!

56:06.931 --> 56:11.933
I was so happy when you
talked us into getting a dog.

56:11.935 --> 56:14.539
It meant that we were permanent.

56:15.772 --> 56:17.774
You're supposed to love me
no matter what.

56:17.776 --> 56:19.275
Yeah, well,
you're making it impossible.

56:19.277 --> 56:21.779
You know, it's pretty hard
to love you sometimes, Tim,

56:21.846 --> 56:24.216
but at least I force myself to.

56:28.953 --> 56:30.955
So, is that it, then?

56:35.960 --> 56:37.963
Yeah.

56:39.230 --> 56:41.233
Me and you.

56:56.413 --> 56:58.417
Look at me.

57:03.154 --> 57:05.924
How are you not crying?

58:19.897 --> 58:22.897
Um, do you wanna just take
a moment and come back later?

58:22.899 --> 58:25.235
No, it's fine. Sorry.

58:25.303 --> 58:27.306
Whoo. OK. OK.

58:28.073 --> 58:30.073
Just one more.

58:33.810 --> 58:35.814
Is that good?

58:38.750 --> 58:42.250
No, it's not good.
It wasn't good.

58:42.252 --> 58:43.888
Tim's the love
of your life.

58:43.922 --> 58:45.590
Yeah, well, you can't know
who the love of your life is

58:45.656 --> 58:47.057
till you're pretty close
to being dead, Mum.

58:47.091 --> 58:48.593
Is the baby kicking lots?

58:48.660 --> 58:50.094
Have you had your
whooping cough vaccinations?

58:50.161 --> 58:52.330
I don't know. I had vaccinations
at the travel doctor.

58:52.364 --> 58:54.899
Travel-?
Zoe, you cannot go overseas.

58:54.933 --> 58:57.502
Dad, I am an internationally
competitive tree climber.

58:57.535 --> 59:00.904
You can't be selfish any more
when you're a mum, Zoe.

59:00.937 --> 59:03.340
When you have a baby, it's like
you forget about yourself

59:03.373 --> 59:05.176
for a bit, because your heart's

59:05.210 --> 59:07.078
running around
outside your body.

59:07.111 --> 59:09.444
I don't wanna just hate my baby
and become just another mum.

59:09.446 --> 59:11.446
You don't wanna be
like me is what you're saying.

59:11.448 --> 59:13.183
No. Why? Did you hate your baby?

59:13.218 --> 59:14.786
- You were not an accident, Zoe.
- You were not an accident.

59:14.852 --> 59:15.853
You weren't.

59:15.919 --> 59:19.624
Can you just stop being parents
for one second?

59:20.792 --> 59:21.692
Jeez.

59:59.163 --> 1:00:01.733
Think you might be expecting me.

1:00:03.100 --> 1:00:06.503
Wow.
You didn't lie on your profile.

1:00:06.571 --> 1:00:08.640
Mm. It's a little judgemental.

1:00:08.672 --> 1:00:10.408
No, I just-I meant...

1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:13.009
I thought your photo
was fake for sure.

1:00:13.011 --> 1:00:15.746
Oh, just because I have a
fetish, doesn't mean I'm a liar.

1:00:15.779 --> 1:00:18.582
I didn't mean that. I just...

1:00:18.616 --> 1:00:21.016
No, I'm just glad
you're not, like, a...

1:00:21.018 --> 1:00:22.587
like, a creep or anything.

1:00:22.620 --> 1:00:23.853
And I'm really glad
we found each other.

1:00:23.855 --> 1:00:27.826
It is very hard to find
a beautiful, single woman

1:00:27.859 --> 1:00:29.861
with a bonus in her belly.

1:00:32.263 --> 1:00:34.266
How pregnant are you?

1:00:36.466 --> 1:00:38.469
A lot.

1:00:39.370 --> 1:00:41.806
Why do you like pregnant women?

1:00:44.375 --> 1:00:48.446
Some people think it's the glow.
No, no, it's...

1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:51.682
it's just that it's really wrong
to think of a pregnant woman

1:00:51.716 --> 1:00:54.216
in a sexual way,
you know? It's...

1:00:54.218 --> 1:00:56.520
It's hot.

1:00:56.555 --> 1:00:58.054
It's dirty.

1:00:58.056 --> 1:01:00.221
Thank you.

1:01:01.959 --> 1:01:05.797
Plus, you know, you can't
get pregnant again.

1:01:05.830 --> 1:01:08.299
But, I mean,
we can take it slow.

1:01:13.803 --> 1:01:15.237
You can touch it if you like.

1:01:15.239 --> 1:01:16.406
OK.

1:01:16.408 --> 1:01:18.410
Ohh. Wow.

1:01:19.076 --> 1:01:21.076
You are so pregnant.

1:01:24.314 --> 1:01:25.983
Oh my goodness.

1:01:29.185 --> 1:01:30.553
- Oh, uh...
- Yeah?

1:01:30.587 --> 1:01:32.756
- Yeah.
- OK. Cool.

1:01:35.192 --> 1:01:37.259
Wait. What's wrong?

1:01:37.261 --> 1:01:39.264
You OK?

1:01:41.533 --> 1:01:43.535
What's going on?

1:01:54.111 --> 1:01:56.113
Uh...

1:02:04.522 --> 1:02:06.525
I'm not allowed in there.

1:02:23.140 --> 1:02:24.973
Can I get a flat white,
please?

1:02:24.975 --> 1:02:26.808
Decaf for you, though, right?

1:02:26.810 --> 1:02:28.778
- Excuse me?
- I don't-I don't know.

1:02:28.812 --> 1:02:30.812
- Cos I'm pregnant?
- No.

1:02:30.814 --> 1:02:33.049
- How dare you? OK? So...
- Sorry. I didn't-

1:02:33.084 --> 1:02:35.484
Oh! My sugar.

1:02:35.486 --> 1:02:38.923
She's actually allowed
up to two cups a day.

1:02:41.991 --> 1:02:44.062
Sorry about that.

1:02:45.263 --> 1:02:47.265
Have mine.

1:02:48.332 --> 1:02:51.736
Thanks for
being nice to me, Brian.

1:03:27.471 --> 1:03:29.871
Whoa!

1:03:42.453 --> 1:03:44.456
- Yeah.
- Yip.

1:03:45.989 --> 1:03:47.058
Thanks.

1:03:47.125 --> 1:03:49.127
Hold my hand.

1:03:53.397 --> 1:03:55.399
Have a seat.

1:04:13.683 --> 1:04:15.750
- What are you doing?
- Getting my one-second video.

1:04:15.752 --> 1:04:18.221
- Don't.
- Got it.

1:04:18.254 --> 1:04:20.490
All right, so, we've got
a lot to get through today.

1:04:20.524 --> 1:04:23.094
Can I have all the women up
lining across the room

1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:25.429
in order of your
due dates, please?

1:04:25.495 --> 1:04:28.232
That's right - up off your
seats. Yeah.

1:04:28.265 --> 1:04:32.269
And we've got a new one -
Zoe, is it? When are you due?

1:04:35.272 --> 1:04:37.075
I've forgotten.

1:04:37.107 --> 1:04:38.109
19th of June.

1:04:38.176 --> 1:04:40.011
- 19th of June.
- Oh, June 19th.

1:04:40.044 --> 1:04:42.745
Jump over here with
all our other June babies.

1:04:42.779 --> 1:04:46.115
You guys all know each other
from having sex in September.

1:04:46.183 --> 1:04:47.785
Do you know what you're having?

1:04:47.852 --> 1:04:49.252
No.

1:04:49.285 --> 1:04:51.921
Not really a details person,
are you?

1:04:51.955 --> 1:04:55.292
- Excuse me?
- Well, Mummy doesn't know much.

1:04:56.460 --> 1:04:58.460
OK, you need to leave.

1:04:58.462 --> 1:05:02.033
Thank you. Out of the classroom.
Yeah. Out the door.

1:05:02.065 --> 1:05:03.600
I'm sorry.

1:05:04.634 --> 1:05:06.970
Beth, you were
being a bitch, though.

1:05:08.806 --> 1:05:09.974
What is the matter with you?!

1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:12.809
Me? You just found someone else
to be a dad with.

1:05:12.877 --> 1:05:14.777
Who the fuck is Brian?!

1:05:14.812 --> 1:05:17.214
I'm a preggophile, Tim.

1:05:17.247 --> 1:05:18.982
You know what? You're
banned from the labour. OK?

1:05:19.049 --> 1:05:21.984
- I don't want you there.
- It's my baby as well.

1:05:21.986 --> 1:05:24.455
Pretty sure it's mine.
It's mine, actually.

1:05:24.489 --> 1:05:26.891
It's definitely more mine
than yours.

1:05:43.107 --> 1:05:44.841
Not too uncomfortable?

1:05:44.843 --> 1:05:46.841
No.

1:05:49.080 --> 1:05:52.083
Wow. You look...

1:05:52.116 --> 1:05:54.181
achingly beautiful.

1:05:54.183 --> 1:05:56.319
Cheers.

1:06:02.192 --> 1:06:05.696
Is that OK?
It doesn't feel too weird?

1:06:05.763 --> 1:06:07.766
No, no, no, no.

1:06:09.134 --> 1:06:10.535
Whoa.

1:06:10.602 --> 1:06:12.603
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

1:06:15.372 --> 1:06:17.374
- Oh.
- Mmm.

1:06:19.210 --> 1:06:20.845
Oh.

1:06:22.712 --> 1:06:25.015
- OK.
- Shall we?

1:06:25.049 --> 1:06:27.218
You're strong.

1:06:31.888 --> 1:06:33.892
Wow. Ooh.

1:06:37.562 --> 1:06:39.797
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I can't. I know-You know-

1:06:39.830 --> 1:06:41.562
- Yeah, no, I can't do it.
- What's wrong?

1:06:41.564 --> 1:06:43.230
- It's just a bit too much.
- I'm sorry.

1:06:43.232 --> 1:06:44.400
No. No, no, no, no. It's fine.

1:06:44.402 --> 1:06:46.403
But I don't know
what I was actually thinking.

1:06:46.469 --> 1:06:47.971
Zoe, wait, please.
Please don't go.

1:06:48.006 --> 1:06:51.739
Zoe! I think I felt
your baby kick before.

1:06:51.741 --> 1:06:53.408
Yeah.

1:06:53.410 --> 1:06:55.645
Oh my God.

1:07:04.154 --> 1:07:06.254
Hi.

1:07:06.256 --> 1:07:09.526
Um, I need you.
Can you please come get me?

1:07:18.669 --> 1:07:20.337
I'm sorry, Mol.

1:07:21.538 --> 1:07:24.941
I didn't want you to think of
me as, like, pregnant Zoe.

1:07:27.777 --> 1:07:29.613
When I'm a mum, I'm just gonna
have, like, no mum friends.

1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:32.951
I'm just gonna have
all the same friends.

1:07:40.625 --> 1:07:43.393
I just really want
my old life back.

1:07:45.228 --> 1:07:47.232
Everything's fucked.

1:08:03.147 --> 1:08:05.315
I'm sorry about you and Tim.

1:08:12.989 --> 1:08:14.993
Can I have that bracelet?

1:08:24.835 --> 1:08:26.837
Can I have all of them?

1:08:31.108 --> 1:08:33.111
Thanks.

1:08:35.345 --> 1:08:37.314
Ugh.

1:08:37.348 --> 1:08:41.182
You've got tiny wrists.

1:08:47.291 --> 1:08:50.361
Enjoying work? Yeah?

1:08:50.426 --> 1:08:52.526
Just watch out.

1:08:52.528 --> 1:08:56.030
You happy there?
Ooh, here we go.

1:08:56.032 --> 1:08:58.768
Oh, there's an ant on that.

1:08:58.801 --> 1:09:00.772
Yeah. Sorry, darling.

1:09:03.206 --> 1:09:05.209
My baby's gonna be...

1:09:06.644 --> 1:09:08.646
brown!

1:09:14.218 --> 1:09:15.886
Whoa.

1:09:15.952 --> 1:09:17.955
- Thank you.
- Hm.

1:09:20.157 --> 1:09:23.126
Hey, will you come overseas
with me tomorrow?

1:09:23.161 --> 1:09:25.196
You can use Tim's ticket.

1:09:25.229 --> 1:09:27.966
But you can't go overseas,
though.

1:09:29.666 --> 1:09:31.968
Sorry, sweetie.

1:09:36.506 --> 1:09:38.308
Cute.

1:09:38.908 --> 1:09:41.245
Cute.

1:09:41.310 --> 1:09:43.647
Cute, cute, cute.

1:09:50.354 --> 1:09:51.989
The tunes sound like
post-natal depression,

1:09:52.023 --> 1:09:54.923
but it's the only thing
that gets Frankie to sleep.

1:09:54.925 --> 1:09:57.495
Thank you, Alice.

1:09:57.528 --> 1:09:59.530
Lovely, isn't it?

1:10:19.950 --> 1:10:23.354
I invited Tim to come today,
but... he didn't want to.

1:10:23.386 --> 1:10:28.789
I didn't want him to come.
Can you stop talking to Tim?

1:10:28.791 --> 1:10:32.129
You sure you wanna do this
by yourself, Zo?

1:10:33.964 --> 1:10:36.300
I can do anything by myself.

1:10:42.238 --> 1:10:44.472
Can you move your arms
by yourself?

1:10:44.474 --> 1:10:45.473
No.

1:10:45.475 --> 1:10:47.611
No, I can't.

1:10:47.644 --> 1:10:48.611
You can stay here,

1:10:48.679 --> 1:10:52.815
but I'm not gonna
look after your baby for you.

1:10:52.817 --> 1:10:54.652
It's your baby.

1:10:55.486 --> 1:10:58.455
I'm not gonna be here.
I'm leaving.

1:11:14.337 --> 1:11:16.340
Aah! Ooh!

1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:25.849
- Ooh!
- Zoe!

1:11:25.916 --> 1:11:27.919
Dinner's ready!

1:11:42.032 --> 1:11:44.701
- You all right?
- Yeah. Thank you.

1:11:49.206 --> 1:11:51.542
Thanks so much. Won't be long.

1:11:55.144 --> 1:11:57.147
Any day now.

1:11:59.116 --> 1:12:02.383
- Congratulations.
- Oh, it's-it's not mine.

1:12:02.385 --> 1:12:03.853
Oh. OK.

1:12:03.886 --> 1:12:05.855
I- I'm actually having a baby,
though.

1:12:05.889 --> 1:12:08.459
Like, you're having a baby
with someone else?

1:12:08.492 --> 1:12:09.860
Yeah.

1:12:09.893 --> 1:12:11.529
Whoa.

1:12:11.562 --> 1:12:14.498
Sounds like you've got
quite a bit on.

1:12:18.736 --> 1:12:21.738
Yeah, it's... it's not like
that. It's just a coincidence,

1:12:21.804 --> 1:12:25.375
because I met her at our
antenatal class, and, uh...

1:12:25.408 --> 1:12:28.513
No, it sounds bad.
It sounds really bad.

1:12:30.413 --> 1:12:32.215
It-It is quite bad.

1:12:32.248 --> 1:12:33.983
Dude.

1:12:34.018 --> 1:12:36.421
You're running the wrong way.

1:13:16.126 --> 1:13:18.595
Are you pregnant?

1:13:18.629 --> 1:13:20.430
Sorry. I'm... so sorry.

1:13:21.364 --> 1:13:24.402
Forget I said that.
Have a good flight.

1:13:25.868 --> 1:13:29.137
You don't look it.

1:13:38.814 --> 1:13:40.817
Zoe! Zoe!

1:13:43.554 --> 1:13:45.556
Ooh.

1:13:51.162 --> 1:13:53.164
Ohh.

1:13:58.568 --> 1:14:00.670
Ma'am,...

1:14:00.737 --> 1:14:02.739
are you in labour?

1:14:05.242 --> 1:14:06.810
OK.

1:14:06.844 --> 1:14:07.978
I'm calling an ambulance.

1:14:08.010 --> 1:14:10.013
Zoe.

1:14:17.955 --> 1:14:19.488
- Penny.
- Tim, the hospital called.

1:14:19.523 --> 1:14:21.859
- Zoe's gone into labour.
- She's not supposed to be.

1:14:21.925 --> 1:14:23.193
- It's too early.
- I know.

1:14:23.260 --> 1:14:25.028
She doesn't want us there,
but I think you should go.

1:14:25.095 --> 1:14:26.361
OK.

1:14:30.099 --> 1:14:32.102
Ooh! Ooh.

1:14:36.105 --> 1:14:39.540
Oh. Uh, Zoe? I'm gonna need you
to get back on the bed, please,

1:14:39.542 --> 1:14:41.879
for the monitor.

1:14:48.152 --> 1:14:50.688
Do you want me to
call someone yet, or...?

1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:54.558
No! I'm fine. I'm actually fine,
cos I actually like being alone.

1:14:54.625 --> 1:14:56.057
It's quite good for me.

1:14:56.059 --> 1:14:57.561
- OK.
- Yeah.

1:14:57.627 --> 1:14:59.697
Thank you.

1:14:59.729 --> 1:15:01.364
Catch ya later.

1:15:01.398 --> 1:15:03.231
- I'm still here.
- Oh.

1:15:03.233 --> 1:15:05.734
- Yeah. Do you have any Frujus?
- Nope!

1:15:05.736 --> 1:15:07.371
- OK.
- No. None at all.

1:15:07.403 --> 1:15:09.406
It's fine. Whoo.

1:15:22.318 --> 1:15:25.922
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1:15:31.428 --> 1:15:32.761
Zoe?

1:15:32.763 --> 1:15:35.666
You can't keep
sneaking off the bed.

1:15:37.434 --> 1:15:40.435
How bad is the pain
from one to 10?

1:15:40.437 --> 1:15:41.837
- One.
- One?

1:15:41.871 --> 1:15:44.340
- Mm-hm.
- 10 is the most extreme,

1:15:44.373 --> 1:15:47.778
the most extreme pain.
So from one to 10...?

1:15:49.045 --> 1:15:50.846
Zero, then.

1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:53.116
- Yeah, you're tellin' porkies.
- I'm not.

1:15:53.183 --> 1:15:54.283
- Yep.
- Nah.

1:15:54.350 --> 1:15:57.586
- It's not impressing me.
- Like, a negative-one.

1:15:57.621 --> 1:15:59.623
Not impressing me.

1:16:16.305 --> 1:16:18.308
You got this, bro.

1:16:20.309 --> 1:16:22.580
Oi, dads wear seat belts too.

1:16:23.581 --> 1:16:25.583
Yip.

1:16:34.892 --> 1:16:36.894
Aah!

1:16:38.562 --> 1:16:40.328
Ooh.

1:16:40.330 --> 1:16:41.966
Get on the bed!

1:16:41.998 --> 1:16:45.336
Aren't you glad
I wasn't on the bed?!

1:16:45.402 --> 1:16:47.502
- Come on.
- Wait, I'm disgusting.

1:16:47.504 --> 1:16:48.738
- Come on.
- Block your nose.

1:16:48.772 --> 1:16:52.176
I don't care. There's nowhere
to hide when you're in labour.

1:16:52.242 --> 1:16:53.842
Man.

1:16:53.844 --> 1:16:56.980
If only there was someone
you knew, you know?

1:16:57.013 --> 1:16:59.815
Maybe someone I could call?

1:17:02.752 --> 1:17:04.587
Do you think pgnant women
just become mothers

1:17:04.621 --> 1:17:07.423
- as soon as they give birth?
- Um,...

1:17:07.456 --> 1:17:09.459
yes.

1:17:11.194 --> 1:17:13.531
- Yep.
- What if I become a dick?

1:17:15.264 --> 1:17:17.634
I think you're already a dick.

1:17:20.871 --> 1:17:22.873
I know.

1:17:23.541 --> 1:17:25.543
Quite a dick.

1:17:30.046 --> 1:17:33.317
You decide if you're
comin' or goin', OK?

1:19:17.554 --> 1:19:19.122
Hi.

1:19:19.154 --> 1:19:21.157
Hi.

1:19:26.764 --> 1:19:28.998
I'm probably gonna have
a baby today.

1:19:29.065 --> 1:19:31.836
That's great, Zo.

1:19:32.935 --> 1:19:35.072
That's so good.

1:19:37.607 --> 1:19:39.843
Um, so, I'm at the hospital,

1:19:39.908 --> 1:19:43.979
and I was just kind of hoping
you might be able to come,

1:19:44.014 --> 1:19:45.482
cos I, um...

1:19:45.515 --> 1:19:47.349
I'm really scared,

1:19:47.416 --> 1:19:50.353
and, um,
I think I need you,...

1:19:51.688 --> 1:19:56.826
cos I've kind of forgotten
how to be me, and, um,...

1:19:56.859 --> 1:19:59.328
I think I need you to remind me.

1:19:59.362 --> 1:20:00.529
Yeah.

1:20:00.531 --> 1:20:03.699
Yeah, definitely.
I'm coming, OK?

1:20:03.701 --> 1:20:06.002
I'm gonna be there
really, really soon.

1:20:06.036 --> 1:20:07.705
Yeah. OK.

1:20:07.770 --> 1:20:08.703
- Oh fuck, bro! The pigs!
- Oi!

1:20:08.705 --> 1:20:09.706
Just don't be scared.

1:20:09.773 --> 1:20:11.842
- Oh, you forgot your suit!
- It doesn't matter!

1:20:11.875 --> 1:20:13.542
Stay on the phone, Zoe, OK?

1:20:13.544 --> 1:20:15.345
- Bro, just go!
- Hey! Get back here!

1:20:17.045 --> 1:20:18.514
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hey!

1:20:18.549 --> 1:20:20.550
Where are you?
Are you running?

1:20:20.617 --> 1:20:22.620
OK, I'm comin' in.

1:20:27.290 --> 1:20:28.792
- Ohh!
- I'm here!

1:20:28.825 --> 1:20:31.226
What?

1:20:34.898 --> 1:20:36.967
How'd you get here so fast?

1:20:37.734 --> 1:20:38.969
I was outside.

1:20:39.001 --> 1:20:41.537
Oh God! Let me die!
Let me die, Tim.

1:20:41.571 --> 1:20:43.473
Do you think you could die,
or are you just saying that?

1:20:43.505 --> 1:20:45.307
You can get in if you want.

1:20:45.341 --> 1:20:47.411
Oh my God! I shouldn't be alive!

1:20:47.477 --> 1:20:48.877
Come here.
Can you please come here?

1:20:48.912 --> 1:20:52.549
Well, I mean, that's blood.
That's... That is your blood.

1:20:52.582 --> 1:20:56.185
Yeah. Come here.
Just come over here, please.

1:20:58.988 --> 1:21:02.224
- Oh my God!
- Oh, here we go, here we go.

1:21:02.257 --> 1:21:04.827
- Yeah. Come here!
- Wha... Wha...

1:21:04.861 --> 1:21:06.430
- What should I do?
- Just touch me.

1:21:06.496 --> 1:21:08.598
Just touch me somewhere.
Just touch me.

1:21:08.665 --> 1:21:11.000
Ooh. Oh my God.

1:21:14.203 --> 1:21:16.072
I thought I knew what motherhood
is, and I just don't.

1:21:16.105 --> 1:21:18.841
I don't know, actually.
I just want Speck to be OK.

1:21:18.876 --> 1:21:21.177
Speck will be.
He's a honeydew melon.

1:21:23.447 --> 1:21:25.015
Hey, let's do the next
contraction together, OK?

1:21:25.049 --> 1:21:27.917
OK. OK. I'm pretty sure
that's not how it works.

1:21:27.952 --> 1:21:30.621
It's just a one-person thing,
but just... OK.

1:21:30.687 --> 1:21:32.288
Let's do that.

1:21:32.355 --> 1:21:34.690
- You ready?
- Yes!

1:21:34.724 --> 1:21:37.861
You are not chilling out
in a spa pool!

1:21:37.894 --> 1:21:39.863
What are you doing in there?

1:21:39.895 --> 1:21:42.297
That's... blood. Oh my God.
Why didn't you tell me

1:21:42.364 --> 1:21:44.801
there was blood?
Get out. Both of you, get out.

1:21:46.635 --> 1:21:48.705
OK.

1:21:48.737 --> 1:21:50.706
- OK. OK.
- I think I am in labour now.

1:21:50.739 --> 1:21:52.809
Oh, OK. Terrific You're
gonna need a caesar as well.

1:21:52.876 --> 1:21:55.546
That baby is coming out
right now.

1:21:57.980 --> 1:21:59.315
Ohh.

1:21:59.382 --> 1:22:01.483
OK. We're ready.

1:22:01.550 --> 1:22:03.118
Almost there.

1:22:03.153 --> 1:22:07.320
And here's your baby.

1:22:13.162 --> 1:22:16.565
This is Zoe. She's your mum.

1:22:21.404 --> 1:22:23.407
Hi.

1:22:24.273 --> 1:22:26.276
Hey.

1:22:26.910 --> 1:22:28.912
Hi.

1:22:29.513 --> 1:22:30.913
Hi.

1:22:30.947 --> 1:22:32.015
Whoa!

1:22:32.114 --> 1:22:34.184
- What the hell are you doing?!
- What are you doing?!

1:22:34.250 --> 1:22:36.086
You just got glitter in her
abdomen! You got glitter

1:22:36.118 --> 1:22:37.517
- in the incision.
- Oh my God. Oh.

1:22:37.519 --> 1:22:39.755
- Get outta here!
- I'm so sorry. I...

1:22:39.788 --> 1:22:41.188
I really thought
that was gonna be magical.

1:22:41.190 --> 1:22:42.425
Come on. Come with me. Get out.

1:22:42.457 --> 1:22:44.193
I'm so sorry!
Please let me stay.

1:22:44.260 --> 1:22:46.861
Oh, what do you think this is -
a bloody 21st or something?

1:22:51.367 --> 1:22:53.368
Go with him.

1:22:54.537 --> 1:22:57.006
All right, Dad. Come with us.

1:22:57.040 --> 1:22:58.875
- Go.
- Unbelievable.

1:22:58.942 --> 1:23:01.877
I'm so sorry, guys. He's been
a pain in the arse all day.

1:23:14.224 --> 1:23:18.561
Look at him in his little warm
plastic house.

1:23:18.627 --> 1:23:20.630
So beautiful.

1:23:22.565 --> 1:23:24.565
I wonder when we can
take him home.

1:23:24.567 --> 1:23:27.837
I'm so embarrassed.
I was gonna run away.

1:23:30.139 --> 1:23:33.676
I didn't know it was you.
It was you all along.

1:23:35.478 --> 1:23:37.578
I love you.

1:23:37.580 --> 1:23:42.152
I would chainsaw my own arms off
if it meant you were OK.

1:23:42.185 --> 1:23:46.087
I don't know how I'd do
the other arm, though.

1:23:46.089 --> 1:23:48.091
Figure it out.

1:24:02.605 --> 1:24:04.907
Hey.

1:24:04.940 --> 1:24:07.277
That's your dad. Yeah.

1:24:07.343 --> 1:24:09.610
- That's your mum.
- Hi.

1:24:13.683 --> 1:24:16.252
Do you wanna stay the night?

1:24:16.285 --> 1:24:18.287
Yeah.

1:24:19.956 --> 1:24:21.959
You're not allowed.

1:24:22.626 --> 1:24:24.628
I don't care.

1:24:27.197 --> 1:24:29.933
I'm glad you're up, Speck.

1:24:29.965 --> 1:24:31.968
I've made you something.

1:24:41.711 --> 1:24:44.212
Oh gosh.

1:25:19.114 --> 1:25:21.317
- In here? Yeah? OK.
- OK.

1:25:21.349 --> 1:25:22.919
There we go.

1:25:22.952 --> 1:25:25.520
Yay!

1:25:25.522 --> 1:25:27.623
Uh, do you think we got one?

1:25:29.959 --> 1:25:31.961
Hand down.

1:25:34.930 --> 1:25:36.665
Can we just photoshop
the finger out?

1:25:36.698 --> 1:25:37.767
No.

1:25:37.834 --> 1:25:40.769
Look. Oh, look at them.
And one, two, three.

1:25:47.044 --> 1:25:48.845
Look at Mummy!

1:25:48.877 --> 1:25:51.214
Look, Speck. Way up there.

1:25:51.279 --> 1:25:53.282
Whoo!

1:25:55.218 --> 1:25:56.519
Hey!

1:25:56.553 --> 1:25:58.720
Look at Mummy!

1:26:04.227 --> 1:26:06.393
You're not even looking. Rude.

1:31:00.790 --> 1:31:01.924
Hey!
