I went back to
my old job to prove

41:37.720 --> 41:39.280
I could be trusted
not to fuck up again.

41:39.304 --> 41:41.280
I trust myself,
of course,

41:41.336 --> 41:43.896
but it's important that my colleagues
see me work my way back up.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.201
Even if that means putting up
with an asshole like chaput.

41:46.225 --> 41:47.120
Yup.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.320
Elise, everybody
fucks up all the time...

41:49.400 --> 41:51.040
Professionally, personally.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.800
The main thing
about being a boss is

41:52.880 --> 41:54.200
owning your mistakes.

41:54.280 --> 41:55.440
Isn't that part

41:55.520 --> 41:57.280
of making
a marriage work, too?

42:15.256 --> 42:16.256
Karl: What'd she say?

42:16.280 --> 42:18.320
We heard kids.
In here.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.440
[Knock on door]

42:25.520 --> 42:26.720
[Knock on door]

42:36.960 --> 42:38.160
Police!

43:12.560 --> 43:14.560
Whoa. Hello.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.120
Hey.

43:18.200 --> 43:21.720
All right. Stand. Um...

43:21.800 --> 43:23.800
[Speaking French]

43:33.600 --> 43:35.200
Elise?

43:38.000 --> 43:39.600
Charlie?

43:43.600 --> 43:45.520
[Dog barking]

43:45.600 --> 43:47.600
Heads up!

44:25.520 --> 44:27.960
His name
is Charlie Moreau.

44:28.040 --> 44:29.560
Eight years ago, Olivier
and I arrested

44:29.640 --> 44:32.560
his father Jacques for
his murder.

44:32.640 --> 44:36.240
It took a jury 14 minutes
to convict him.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.880
We all went out afterwards
to celebrate.

45:08.720 --> 45:10.280
[Sobbing]

45:19.800 --> 45:22.720
[Woman singing indistinctly,
hushed vocals]

45:37.920 --> 45:40.920
Theo, wake up.

45:41.305 --> 45:47.717
