08:42.308 --> 08:44.408
(crying): This is all my fault.

08:44.411 --> 08:46.810
Oh. No, no, no, no, come, come.

08:46.813 --> 08:47.945
Don't do that.

08:47.948 --> 08:49.580
Guilt is such a useless emotion.

08:49.583 --> 08:53.817
It's completely unflattering
on such a beautiful face.

08:53.820 --> 08:56.487
You...

08:56.490 --> 08:58.722
you think I'm beautiful?

08:58.725 --> 09:01.525
(chuckles) Oh!

09:01.528 --> 09:04.495
(moaning and squealing)

09:04.498 --> 09:06.530
Lucifer, what are you doing?

09:06.533 --> 09:08.499
Detective, I've found you a lead.

09:08.502 --> 09:09.700
Where... in her mouth?

09:09.703 --> 09:10.801
Yes, actually!

09:10.804 --> 09:12.336
Imagine what I can
find in other orifices.

09:12.339 --> 09:14.905
- Ooh!
- (chuckles)

09:14.908 --> 09:16.307
Okay.

09:16.310 --> 09:19.443
I apologize. I'm just being thorough.

09:19.446 --> 09:21.313
Call me. Easy!

09:24.418 --> 09:26.684
(indistinct chatter)

09:26.687 --> 09:28.018
CHLOE: What has gotten into you?

09:28.021 --> 09:29.553
I thought you were
getting the hang of this.

09:29.556 --> 09:30.854
LUCIFER: I got you a lead, didn't I?

09:30.857 --> 09:33.023
The ex-boyfriend, you looking into him?

09:33.026 --> 09:35.059
Yeah, Dan's on it, but
that's not the point.

09:35.062 --> 09:38.023
This whole new thing,
you making out with witnesses?

09:38.048 --> 09:39.399
Completely inappropriate.

09:39.424 --> 09:41.732
When are you going to get it?
Inappropriate is what I do.

09:41.735 --> 09:43.033
You've always been a
pain in the ass, Lucifer,

09:43.036 --> 09:45.469
but I've never seen you like this.

09:45.472 --> 09:47.220
What's going on? What happened?

09:47.245 --> 09:48.651
Just enough of the
questioning, Detective.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.074
Reprimand me or let's get on with it.

09:50.077 --> 09:51.075
(scoffs)

09:51.078 --> 09:52.376
DAN: Wow.

09:52.379 --> 09:54.745
Can I talk to you, please?

09:54.748 --> 09:56.180
(groans) Pull your pants up.

09:56.183 --> 09:57.214
Hi.

09:57.217 --> 09:58.349
Hey, what's up with him?

09:58.352 --> 09:59.550
Looks like he just rolled
out of bed or something.

09:59.553 --> 10:00.551
CHLOE: I don't know.

10:00.554 --> 10:01.418
There's just something

10:01.421 --> 10:02.519
completely off about him today.

10:02.522 --> 10:03.520
Yeah, well, there's something's

10:03.523 --> 10:04.688
really off about him every day.

10:04.691 --> 10:05.656
No, no, it's different.

10:05.659 --> 10:07.091
He's missing his usual...

10:07.094 --> 10:09.159
extreme glee.

10:09.162 --> 10:12.162
- He-he just seems really dark.
- Look, is he gonna be a problem?

10:12.165 --> 10:13.831
'Cause you know I wouldn't
mind if you send him home.

10:13.834 --> 10:14.765
- Nope, not a problem.
- You sure?

10:14.768 --> 10:16.233
Yep, got it. I can handle it.

10:16.236 --> 10:17.501
What'd you get from ballistics?

10:17.504 --> 10:18.902
I confirmed

10:18.905 --> 10:20.671
large caliber bullet from a rifle,
long-range.

10:20.674 --> 10:23.044
I have a team searching a wider
perimeter for more evidence.

10:23.069 --> 10:24.074
- (door swings open)
- And I finished

10:24.077 --> 10:25.976
the background check on
everyone at the wedding.

10:25.979 --> 10:27.644
All clean.

10:27.647 --> 10:29.146
But the ex-boyfriend,
Jason Myers, he's not.

10:29.149 --> 10:31.582
He's got one aggravated assault,
two weapons violations.

10:31.585 --> 10:33.305
I have him waiting in
interrogation for you.

10:44.231 --> 10:46.697
Well...

10:46.700 --> 10:49.337
hello, bad guy.

10:49.362 --> 10:55.223

10:59.244 --> 11:01.556
DAN: Lucifer, open the damn door!

11:01.559 --> 11:02.724
- (banging on door)
- CHLOE: Lucifer!

11:02.727 --> 11:05.594
Lucifer, open this door right now!

11:05.597 --> 11:07.797
(sobbing)

11:10.635 --> 11:12.033
Lucifer, what are you doing?

11:12.036 --> 11:13.168
(sighs)

11:13.171 --> 11:14.836
Just having a little chitchat

11:14.839 --> 11:16.071
with our friend here.

11:16.074 --> 11:17.806
Care to know what I've learned?

11:17.809 --> 11:20.041
You get out of there now.

11:20.044 --> 11:23.079
Oh, she's so demanding.

11:28.987 --> 11:31.152
Well... he's innocent.

11:31.155 --> 11:32.821
CHLOE: Oh, did you figure that out

11:32.824 --> 11:34.789
before or after you tortured him?

11:34.792 --> 11:36.024
You tortured a suspect?

11:36.027 --> 11:37.892
I didn't lay a finger
on the spineless cretin.

11:37.895 --> 11:39.361
Come on, the guy's sitting
on the floor crying.

11:39.364 --> 11:41.129
Crying because of a woman,

11:41.132 --> 11:43.431
not me... the bride, to be specific.

11:43.434 --> 11:45.166
However, he did not kill her.

11:45.169 --> 11:46.334
And you know that how?

11:46.337 --> 11:47.936
He said he couldn't take
seeing the bride so happy,

11:47.939 --> 11:50.772
so he ran off, crying...
Surprise, surprise...

11:50.775 --> 11:52.937
Well before the shooting started.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.376
And you believed that?

11:54.379 --> 11:56.144
- Of course not. He had an alibi.
- Really?

11:56.147 --> 11:58.480
Yes. Leaving the park
on the service road,

11:58.483 --> 12:00.448
he bumped into a wedding musician.

12:00.451 --> 12:03.151
Didn't get a name, but he had a
buzz cut and a guitar case.

12:03.154 --> 12:05.520
A guitar? No.

12:05.523 --> 12:07.355
They booked a DJ, not a live band.

12:07.358 --> 12:09.991
Trust me, crying guy isn't lying.

12:09.994 --> 12:12.894
Maybe, but maybe there
wasn't a guitar in that case.

12:12.897 --> 12:15.997
Oh, so you think our musician
might be the shooter.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.066
He's pretty shaken up,
but he's gonna be okay.

12:18.069 --> 12:19.134
You're lucky.

12:19.137 --> 12:21.136
Okay, I still have to question properly.

12:21.139 --> 12:23.638
But there's a possibility
that Jason saw our shooter,

12:23.641 --> 12:26.107
and he may have been carrying
his rifle in a guitar case.

12:26.110 --> 12:28.143
Last seen on the park service road.

12:28.146 --> 12:30.212
I'm on it.

12:32.817 --> 12:35.183
- You're welcome.
- Excuse me?

12:35.186 --> 12:38.156
What you just did in there
is incredibly inappropriate.

12:38.181 --> 12:39.154
Are you trying

12:39.157 --> 12:40.288
to get in trouble or are you trying

12:40.291 --> 12:41.456
to piss me off?

12:41.459 --> 12:42.791
I did what I had to do.

12:42.794 --> 12:43.962
Got results, didn't I?

12:43.987 --> 12:46.227
If you pull one more stunt like that,

12:46.230 --> 12:48.663
I don't care how effective you are,

12:48.666 --> 12:49.932
I will bench you.

13:07.685 --> 13:10.086
(single note resonates)

13:12.256 --> 13:14.657
I take it you heard about Uriel?

13:19.030 --> 13:21.029
Is Lucifer here?

13:21.032 --> 13:22.797
No, he's out.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.367
Probably in the middle
of some three-way,

13:25.370 --> 13:26.968
like nothing happened.

13:26.971 --> 13:29.704
Not everyone grieves the same way.

13:29.707 --> 13:33.508
Lucifer, he's never been one to...

13:33.511 --> 13:36.244
face his emotions.

13:36.247 --> 13:39.547
Instead of looking in, he acts out.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.850
You know, a rebellion here,

13:41.853 --> 13:44.487
an apple there?

13:45.957 --> 13:47.055
But you...

13:47.058 --> 13:48.858
How are you doing?

13:51.028 --> 13:53.328
Come on, tell your mom.

13:53.331 --> 13:56.131
When I first heard of Uriel's death,

13:56.134 --> 13:57.465
I wanted to blame Lucifer.

13:57.468 --> 14:00.869
But... then I realized I
was just as much to blame,

14:00.872 --> 14:04.105
if not more.

14:04.108 --> 14:05.273
None of this would have happened

14:05.276 --> 14:07.208
if I still had my...

14:07.211 --> 14:08.978
Your powers.

14:10.782 --> 14:12.046
How did you know?

14:12.049 --> 14:14.350
A mother knows.

14:17.889 --> 14:20.522
But I also know it's possible

14:20.525 --> 14:24.259
to regain your strength.

14:24.262 --> 14:25.460
That we both can.

14:25.463 --> 14:27.662
No, Mom, it's too late.

14:27.665 --> 14:30.632
Uriel would...

14:30.635 --> 14:33.502
He would still be alive
if it wasn't for me.

14:36.073 --> 14:39.575
Come, there's something you need to see.

14:47.785 --> 14:50.986
Okay, so we found something
near the service road.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.423
Look at this.

14:56.365 --> 14:58.326
It's a nice little hiding
spot behind some bushes.

14:58.329 --> 14:59.727
Disturbed ground.

14:59.730 --> 15:01.229
Clear view of the stage.

15:01.232 --> 15:03.398
Someone with a rifle
could've made this shot.

15:03.401 --> 15:05.133
What's that?

15:05.136 --> 15:06.301
That...

15:06.304 --> 15:08.036
is a pastry napkin from
a Dutch food truck.

15:08.039 --> 15:10.505
"Freddy's Dutch Oven"? (sniffs)

15:10.508 --> 15:12.414
Love this place. Unfortunate name,

15:12.439 --> 15:14.142
but best stroopwafel in Hollywood.

15:14.145 --> 15:16.110
The napkin is definitely from today.

15:16.113 --> 15:17.612
The syrup is still wet to the touch.

15:17.615 --> 15:19.380
And undoubtedly tasty.

15:19.383 --> 15:22.050
So if the shooter bought this stroop...
whatever you call it...

15:22.053 --> 15:24.152
With his credit card,
we can track his identity.

15:24.155 --> 15:25.453
So we need to get to the food truck

15:25.456 --> 15:26.688
and talk to the owner.

15:26.691 --> 15:27.689
I will put out a BOLO.

15:27.692 --> 15:28.890
What is it with you and BOLOs?

15:28.893 --> 15:31.059
Why don't you just use
Freddy's Dutch Oven app?

15:31.062 --> 15:32.694
Gives you their current locale.

15:32.697 --> 15:34.128
You never know when you're in the mood

15:34.131 --> 15:35.598
for a good strooping.

15:38.069 --> 15:41.803
♪ You better mount up ♪

15:41.806 --> 15:45.507
♪ You better ride on ♪

15:45.510 --> 15:48.743
♪ You better run ♪

15:48.746 --> 15:51.012
♪ Run away ♪

15:51.015 --> 15:53.114
♪ ♪

15:53.117 --> 15:54.349
You know what?

15:54.352 --> 15:55.650
You stay here.

15:55.653 --> 15:57.719
Don't move. I'll do the talking.

15:57.722 --> 16:00.722
Fine by me.

16:00.725 --> 16:02.957
Detective Decker, LAPD.
Are you the owner?

16:02.960 --> 16:05.360
Alfred Loomis, but you
can call me Freddy.

16:05.363 --> 16:07.295
And let me guess. You look like

16:07.298 --> 16:08.730
a "chocolade hagelslag" kind of girl.

16:08.733 --> 16:09.731
Am I right?

16:09.734 --> 16:11.232
Sir, earlier today you served a man

16:11.235 --> 16:13.114
with a buzz cut,
possibly carrying a guitar case.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.301
Does that ring a bell?

16:14.326 --> 16:16.905
If I may, one order
of "oliebollen," please.

16:16.908 --> 16:18.239
What?

16:18.242 --> 16:19.274
Oliebollen.

16:19.277 --> 16:20.975
Literally means "oily balls."

16:20.978 --> 16:22.844
Tastes better than it sounds, believe me.

16:22.847 --> 16:25.179
- Thank you.
- No, sorry, Detective,

16:25.182 --> 16:26.414
I don't remember anyone like that.

16:26.417 --> 16:28.516
But I wasn't here during
the morning shift.

16:28.519 --> 16:30.818
Um, Freddy, I forgot to tell you

16:30.821 --> 16:32.854
a guy like that was here when I opened.

16:32.857 --> 16:35.323
He was asking when you'd be around.

16:35.326 --> 16:36.925
Asking for me specifically?

16:36.928 --> 16:38.760
Actually, you know what?
Make the two orders, please.

16:38.763 --> 16:39.761
- I'm famished.
- (impatient groans, murmurs)

16:39.764 --> 16:42.597
- Lucifer...
- (gunshots)

16:42.600 --> 16:44.300
- Everybody down!
- (panicked screams)

16:46.515 --> 16:48.482
(sirens approaching)

16:49.273 --> 16:50.738
Shooter on the roof. Victim in the truck.

16:50.741 --> 16:51.874
Secure the scene!

16:53.416 --> 16:55.283
Bloody hell!

17:11.262 --> 17:13.561
(seagulls cawing)

17:34.218 --> 17:37.085
(distant siren wailing)

17:37.088 --> 17:39.153
Not very polite of Mr. Shooter to leave

17:39.156 --> 17:40.722
without saying good-bye.

17:40.725 --> 17:42.757
His bullets are saying plenty.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.258
Well, why shoot Food Truck Freddy,

17:44.261 --> 17:45.827
just 'cause you were questioning him?

17:45.830 --> 17:48.863
No, this was premeditated.

17:48.866 --> 17:50.565
The shooter came here to find him,

17:50.568 --> 17:51.933
then went to shoot the bride,

17:51.936 --> 17:54.136
then came back when he
knew Freddy would be here.

17:59.710 --> 18:01.643
This guy's got a list.

18:01.646 --> 18:03.144
God, who's next?

18:03.147 --> 18:05.981
(chuckles) <i>He's</i> not gonna tell you.

18:12.693 --> 18:16.052
Come bloody on!

18:16.055 --> 18:17.320
(sighs)

18:17.323 --> 18:18.890
(banging on machine)

18:20.226 --> 18:21.458
What are you doing?

18:21.461 --> 18:23.093
That's twice now today
I've been denied snacks.

18:23.096 --> 18:24.161
You got change for a hundie?

18:24.164 --> 18:25.562
Oh, God.

18:25.565 --> 18:28.165
All right, ballistics confirmed
the same rifle was used

18:28.168 --> 18:31.101
in both shootings, but no prints
were found on the rooftop.

18:31.104 --> 18:33.134
This guy paid cash at the food truck.

18:33.159 --> 18:35.339
He really covers his tracks.

18:36.476 --> 18:37.941
If I could just find a connection

18:37.944 --> 18:40.143
between our two victims.

18:40.146 --> 18:42.012
But Peggy Russo and Freddy Loomis

18:42.015 --> 18:43.613
seem to have nothing in common.

18:43.616 --> 18:45.115
LUCIFER: Apart from being dead.

18:45.118 --> 18:48.051
Uh, maybe they were just randomly chosen.

18:48.054 --> 18:49.252
Mm, my gut says no.

18:49.255 --> 18:50.887
This guy is too calculating.

18:50.890 --> 18:52.122
Deliberate.

18:52.125 --> 18:54.224
Until we find a link between these t...

18:54.227 --> 18:57.096
Teeny-tiny doughnuts,
or cool ranch puffs?

18:57.121 --> 18:59.283
Lucifer, you can't just steal food

18:59.308 --> 19:00.997
- in the middle of the precinct.
- Why?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.365
Are you gonna put me on the naughty step,

19:02.368 --> 19:04.234
so I can have a think
about what I've done?

19:04.237 --> 19:05.902
(cell phone rings)

19:05.905 --> 19:07.938
Hey, Monkey.

19:07.941 --> 19:09.539
Yes, yeah, I-I'm really sorry.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.741
Work got busy.

19:11.744 --> 19:14.311
Yes, I really, really want to
take you trick-or-treating.

19:14.314 --> 19:16.646
But if Mommy or Daddy
can't make it home in time,

19:16.649 --> 19:19.049
Babysitter Shelly might have
to take you, okay?

19:19.052 --> 19:20.617
Oh, she already left.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.852
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

19:22.855 --> 19:24.354
But when she went into Maze's room,

19:24.357 --> 19:26.356
she ran out screaming.

19:26.359 --> 19:27.857
It was hilarious.

19:27.860 --> 19:30.527
- Who's watching you now?
- Maze.

19:30.530 --> 19:32.762
Can she take me trick-or-treating?

19:32.765 --> 19:35.206
- No.
- Mommy, please?

19:35.231 --> 19:36.567
I promise I'll be good.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.481
Yeah, babe, it's not you
that I'm worried about.

19:38.506 --> 19:40.370
Please, please, please, please?

19:40.373 --> 19:42.539
(huffs)

19:42.542 --> 19:44.041
All right, put Maze on the phone.

19:47.180 --> 19:48.378
Yeah?

19:48.403 --> 19:50.000
What did you do to the babysitter?

19:50.025 --> 19:50.513
Me?

19:50.516 --> 19:51.615
She's the one who didn't knock.

19:51.618 --> 19:53.216
I had no time to hide my toys.

19:53.219 --> 19:56.119
Okay, Maze, look, I have
a favor to ask you.

19:56.122 --> 19:57.287
That's Lucifer's thing.

19:57.290 --> 19:59.723
I know, but I'll never
find a sitter this late.

19:59.726 --> 20:03.693
And trick-or-treating is really
important to Trixie, Maze.

20:03.696 --> 20:05.295
Will you please take her for me?

20:05.298 --> 20:09.065
Sure, I'll take your
offspring for a walk.

20:09.068 --> 20:11.034
Well, she's not a dog, but thank you.

20:11.037 --> 20:14.004
Okay, don't let her out of your sight,

20:14.007 --> 20:16.473
please check her candy,
and take her early,

20:16.476 --> 20:17.774
- like 3:00.
- Great.

20:17.777 --> 20:19.943
Best after-parties don't
start till 3:00 anyway.

20:19.946 --> 20:22.112
Not 3:00 a.m., 3:00 p.m.

20:22.115 --> 20:23.380
I want her home before dark.

20:23.383 --> 20:25.282
And do not take her to any parties.

20:25.285 --> 20:26.650
(scoffs) Lame.

20:26.653 --> 20:27.550
But whatever, your kid.

20:27.553 --> 20:29.452
Thank you. Thank you so much.

20:29.455 --> 20:31.689
Oh, oh, did you see the costume?
I laid it on the bed.

20:33.192 --> 20:34.525
Uh...

20:37.397 --> 20:39.763
What's wrong?

20:39.766 --> 20:42.732
I told Mommy I wanted to be
a princess when I was seven.

20:42.735 --> 20:43.967
Now I'm eight.

20:43.970 --> 20:45.435
And?

20:45.438 --> 20:47.404
Halloween's supposed to
be the one night you get

20:47.407 --> 20:49.340
to be whatever you want.

20:55.114 --> 20:56.847
What do you want to be?

21:04.123 --> 21:06.056
Where did he go?

21:06.059 --> 21:09.526
Hey. I've been talking to
the food truck owner's wife.

21:09.529 --> 21:10.994
She doesn't recognize the zombie bride,

21:10.997 --> 21:13.364
and doesn't think she has any
connection to her husband.

21:15.668 --> 21:18.202
Two victims, two devastated spouses.

21:19.739 --> 21:21.772
Maybe we're looking at
this the wrong way.

21:27.246 --> 21:28.945
Mrs. Loomis, I'm sorry.

21:28.948 --> 21:30.747
I know you're going through a lot.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.183
I have one more question for you, okay?

21:33.186 --> 21:34.784
Do you recognize this man?

21:34.787 --> 21:37.387
Yes, that's Edgar... Romero.

21:37.390 --> 21:38.521
How do you know him?

21:38.524 --> 21:39.723
We've worked together.

21:39.726 --> 21:40.757
I'm a doctor.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.991
He's a lawyer.

21:41.994 --> 21:43.693
He handles many

21:43.696 --> 21:45.528
of our hospital's malpractice suits.

21:45.531 --> 21:47.364
He's married

21:47.367 --> 21:48.665
- to the other victim?
- Yes, but

21:48.668 --> 21:49.866
the connection we've been looking for

21:49.869 --> 21:51.067
isn't between them,

21:51.070 --> 21:53.002
it's between you, the spouses.

21:53.005 --> 21:54.170
So, you think the shooter's upset

21:54.173 --> 21:55.538
because of one of
these malpractice suits?

21:55.541 --> 21:58.141
Maybe. Maybe he's taking it out

21:58.144 --> 21:59.643
on their loved ones.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.145
Can you give us a list of all the cases

22:02.148 --> 22:03.781
that Edgar litigated for you?

22:08.555 --> 22:11.020
CHLOE: When are you gonna tell
me what's going on with you?

22:11.023 --> 22:12.343
Do you want to talk about it?

22:12.368 --> 22:12.956
LUCIFER: Why would I want to do that?

22:12.959 --> 22:13.990
'Cause that's what partners do.

22:13.993 --> 22:14.958
They talk.

22:14.961 --> 22:16.493
I can tell you about my headaches

22:16.496 --> 22:18.261
living with Maze and you can tell me

22:18.264 --> 22:19.429
what's going on with you.

22:19.432 --> 22:21.364
Pass.

22:21.367 --> 22:22.599
Lucifer,

22:22.602 --> 22:24.067
seriously,

22:24.070 --> 22:25.769
whatever you're going through...

22:25.772 --> 22:27.337
I don't know, maybe I can help.

22:27.340 --> 22:28.772
(snorts) How?

22:28.775 --> 22:30.373
By giving me a warm, fuzzy hug?

22:30.376 --> 22:32.575
They won't release the damn case files.

22:32.578 --> 22:35.178
Some crap about new HIPAA
laws requiring extra warrants.

22:35.181 --> 22:37.747
It could be days before we get
a judge to sign off on that.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.716
Oh, well, it looks like
Detective Douche is the one

22:39.719 --> 22:41.418
who needs a hug. Mm, come here, Daniel.

22:41.421 --> 22:43.086
- Mm.
- Get off me, man.

22:43.089 --> 22:44.988
Uh, Daniel, if you want to
talk about your feelings,

22:44.991 --> 22:46.623
Detective Decker is offering.

22:46.626 --> 22:47.724
Why don't give you two a minute

22:47.727 --> 22:48.725
so you can talk about your

22:48.728 --> 22:51.551
earth-shattering problems.

22:51.576 --> 22:53.296
- What was that?
- I told you

22:53.299 --> 22:54.731
something's going on with him.

22:54.734 --> 22:56.132
- I'm getting worried.
- Yeah, well,

22:56.135 --> 22:57.434
honestly, Chloe, we have bigger things

22:57.437 --> 22:58.835
- to worry about right now.
- I know.

22:58.838 --> 23:00.570
I'll see if I can expedite the warrants,

23:00.573 --> 23:02.540
and, uh, call the lieutenant.

23:03.509 --> 23:04.741
Right. Here you go.

23:04.744 --> 23:06.009
Merry Christmas.

23:06.012 --> 23:07.944
Or should I say, Happy Halloween.

23:07.947 --> 23:08.945
Are these the files?

23:08.948 --> 23:10.413
Where did you get these?

23:10.416 --> 23:11.781
Well, if you ask permission,
people can say no,

23:11.784 --> 23:13.082
but flash a badge to the right sap

23:13.085 --> 23:14.718
and voilà.

23:15.922 --> 23:17.220
This is mine.

23:17.223 --> 23:18.721
All right, chill out, Daniel.

23:18.724 --> 23:20.523
What's a little badge
borrowing between friends?

23:20.526 --> 23:22.659
I mean, at least I didn't
have to use this.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.427
You stole my gun and my badge?

23:24.430 --> 23:25.829
What the hell is the matter with you?!

23:25.832 --> 23:26.996
Hey, guys...

23:26.999 --> 23:27.997
Are you gonna take his
side in this right now?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.265
- Is that what you're doing?
- Well, I got the files,

23:29.268 --> 23:31.034
didn't I? I did what I had to do.

23:31.037 --> 23:32.302
Oh, please, don't give me that crap.

23:32.305 --> 23:33.837
You never do what you have to do,

23:33.840 --> 23:35.038
Lucifer.

23:35.041 --> 23:36.473
You only ever do what you want to.

23:36.476 --> 23:38.041
That is not true.

23:38.044 --> 23:40.410
There's a lot of things
that I didn't want to do.

23:40.413 --> 23:41.578
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

23:41.581 --> 23:43.680
Because if I only ever
did what I wanted to do,

23:43.683 --> 23:45.281
then right now, I'd do this.

23:45.284 --> 23:47.418
(Daniel groaning)

23:49.055 --> 23:51.254
What the hell is wrong with you?!

23:51.257 --> 23:52.922
Why are you so surprised, Detective?!

23:52.925 --> 23:53.990
I'm the Devil, remember?

23:53.993 --> 23:55.024
I'm evil!

23:55.027 --> 23:56.674
No, what you are is off this case.

23:56.699 --> 23:58.966
You go home now. You're done.

24:01.123 --> 24:02.489
Go!

24:10.990 --> 24:12.312
CHLOE: Are you okay?

24:12.337 --> 24:14.478
- Not really.
- All right, well...

24:14.481 --> 24:17.581
let's get you checked
out and return the files.

24:17.584 --> 24:19.116
What if we hold off for a bit?

24:19.119 --> 24:20.818
I don't agree

24:20.821 --> 24:22.686
with what Lucifer did.

24:22.689 --> 24:25.089
But there's still a killer out there.

24:25.092 --> 24:27.324
And these files might be
the key to stopping him.

24:27.327 --> 24:29.259
Are you suggesting we keep them?

24:29.262 --> 24:30.895
More like borrow.

24:32.165 --> 24:33.564
AMENADIEL: Where are we going, Mom?

24:33.567 --> 24:34.998
You'll see soon enough.

24:35.001 --> 24:36.934
But first, we need to
get something straight.

24:36.937 --> 24:39.770
Uriel's death was not your fault.

24:39.773 --> 24:41.432
How can you say that, Mom?

24:43.310 --> 24:46.510
Do you remember when
you boys were young?

24:46.513 --> 24:49.012
Uriel always playing pranks on Lucifer

24:49.015 --> 24:50.681
to get your Father's attention?

24:50.684 --> 24:52.616
Annoying little runt.

24:52.619 --> 24:54.518
And he never got in trouble for it

24:54.521 --> 24:56.353
because you took the blame.

24:56.356 --> 24:58.856
Just looking out for
my little brother, Mom.

24:58.859 --> 25:00.758
No, it's more than that.

25:00.761 --> 25:03.827
You have welcomed
responsibility your entire life.

25:03.830 --> 25:06.063
Don't you think you deserve a break?

25:06.066 --> 25:08.632
Mom, you just don't understand.

25:08.635 --> 25:10.934
Don't you think I feel responsible, too?

25:10.937 --> 25:13.203
All of this fighting has been

25:13.206 --> 25:15.672
over me.

25:15.675 --> 25:17.875
Uriel is gone forever because of me,

25:17.878 --> 25:19.476
not you.

25:19.479 --> 25:21.378
How can you say that, Mom?

25:21.381 --> 25:22.780
You did everything

25:22.783 --> 25:23.847
that you could do.

25:23.850 --> 25:25.382
You volunteered to go back to Hell.

25:25.385 --> 25:27.400
You stepped up and did the right thing.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.819
Isn't that all you've been doing?

25:28.822 --> 25:30.721
Trying to please your Father

25:30.724 --> 25:32.623
by doing what you think is right?

25:32.626 --> 25:35.893
You shouldn't be punished.

25:35.896 --> 25:37.928
You should be rewarded.

the cases that involve

27:09.389 --> 27:13.390
both Dr. Loomis and
our zombie groom Edgar.

27:13.393 --> 27:15.158
Six settled, three pending
and that last one there

27:15.161 --> 27:16.560
was recently dismissed.

27:16.563 --> 27:19.329
Wrongful death suit thrown
out for lack of evidence.

27:19.332 --> 27:20.631
That's frustrating.

27:20.634 --> 27:22.332
- Could be motive.
- Yeah. I don't know.

27:22.335 --> 27:24.268
Maybe our plaintiff was
pissed about the dismissal,

27:24.271 --> 27:26.270
decided to settle his
grievances another way.

27:26.273 --> 27:29.239
Let's see... plaintiff, Wes Williams.

27:29.242 --> 27:31.275
He sued for his wife Cassandra's death

27:31.278 --> 27:33.410
after she lost a battle with...

41:01.899 --> 41:04.465
I'm a monster.

41:04.468 --> 41:07.235
A monster who... deserves to be punished.

41:07.238 --> 41:09.637
I believe you feel that way.

41:09.640 --> 41:10.838
(sighs)

41:10.841 --> 41:12.840
And I want to understand.

41:12.843 --> 41:14.609
I truly do!

41:14.612 --> 41:16.544
But, Lucifer, you have to help me.

41:16.547 --> 41:18.946
I need you to be honest with me.

41:18.949 --> 41:21.517
Completely honest...

41:22.693 --> 41:25.053
...about who you are.

41:25.056 --> 41:27.755
Completely honest?

41:27.758 --> 41:29.223
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

41:29.226 --> 41:31.559
Yes, I'm sure.

41:31.562 --> 41:33.995
That's what all of these sessions...

41:33.998 --> 41:37.065
Our entire relationship... Is all about.

41:37.068 --> 41:40.802
Getting to know the <i>real</i> Lucifer.

41:40.805 --> 41:42.737
(exhales)

41:42.740 --> 41:44.639
No more lies.

41:44.642 --> 41:46.808
No more metaphors.

41:46.811 --> 41:48.776
Very well.

41:48.779 --> 41:51.080
♪ ♪

41:56.420 --> 41:59.655
♪ ♪

42:11.235 --> 42:13.368

42:14.705 --> 42:16.805
Doctor?

42:22.513 --> 42:24.067
Uh...
