Yeah, man. Before you
show us anything,

20:05.160 --> 20:07.031
you better give us
some righteous intel.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.772
All right. You told me

20:08.816 --> 20:10.644
to be on the lookout
for any activity on the street

20:10.687 --> 20:12.080
that seemed strange, right?That's right.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.081
You know
who Lolo the Whale is?

20:13.124 --> 20:14.430
Lolo Matani?

20:14.474 --> 20:16.215
Head of the Carson Tribe
in South L.A.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.260
Boom. Word is,
the Whale just sold

20:18.304 --> 20:20.567
three of his booty bars
for a cut-rate price

20:20.610 --> 20:22.960
to the Los Profetas
for 300 large,

20:23.004 --> 20:24.571
then ghosted off the streets.

20:24.614 --> 20:27.182
Now, tell me that
doesn't sound strange to you.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.272
♪ For when they placed it
on his head... ♪

20:30.316 --> 20:32.056
All right, Red.
I guess the LAPD isgonna spring

20:32.100 --> 20:35.146
for your stocking stuffers.[chuckles]

20:35.190 --> 20:37.932
Man, I saw this beautiful
necklace for Westside Danger.

20:37.975 --> 20:40.500
And this perfect, perfect
bracelet for Trickster.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.589
And a pair of perfect earrings
for my girl Bethany.

20:42.632 --> 20:43.938
Oh, whoa, whoa. Bethany?

20:43.981 --> 20:45.461
Yeah. She's from Pasadena.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.898
Hey. Why not just get them
all the same thing?

20:47.942 --> 20:50.031
Man, I got to keep
my game tight.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.467
The same gift for every girl
is a rookie mistake,

20:51.511 --> 20:53.556
especially when
they all friends.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.906
You better be careful
out there, Little Red.Hey, when you dealing

20:55.950 --> 20:58.387
with Little Red,
it's Christmas 365.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.128
[chuckles]

21:03.262 --> 21:05.220
You think this is our guy?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.570
It's our latest
best guess.Lolo the Whale Matani.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.180
King of the Carson Tribe.

21:09.224 --> 21:11.661
He owns a half a dozen
strip joints in the South Bay.

21:11.705 --> 21:14.403
All used to launder money for
the Tribe's amphetamine trade.

21:14.447 --> 21:15.839
NIA:
One of the stolen DNA kits

21:15.883 --> 21:17.319
proved Matani
sexually assaulted

21:17.363 --> 21:18.842
several of the young boys

21:18.886 --> 21:20.714
who attended his
day care centers.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.585
We were a week out from
indicting him for sex crimes.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.587
Think Matani knew it was coming?His lawyer is connected.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.154
He could've found out
we were about to file

21:26.197 --> 21:27.590
charges against him.Yup. So the Whale

21:27.634 --> 21:28.896
liquidates three
of his strip clubs

21:28.939 --> 21:30.593
for cash, hires a crew
to hit the crime lab.

21:30.637 --> 21:33.248
Then destroys the evidence
that could ruin his rep.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.163
And he doesn't mind hurting
some innocents on the way.

21:35.206 --> 21:37.687
Well, he wouldn't last a day
in prison if that ever got out.

21:37.731 --> 21:39.646
Let's go whale hunting.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.430
All right.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.868
Yeah.

21:44.912 --> 21:47.131
HONDO:
Commander.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.742
Everything all right?

21:48.785 --> 21:51.484
Well, if that DNA evidence
isn't returned

21:51.527 --> 21:54.356
sealed and intact, it won't
be able to be used in court,

21:54.400 --> 21:57.533
which means no justice for a lot
of victims and their families.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.274
Well, I'll make
sure my team

21:59.318 --> 22:01.189
treats those evidence
kits with extra care.

22:01.232 --> 22:02.843
All right.How's Rebecca doing?

22:02.886 --> 22:04.192
I know you're close to her.

22:04.235 --> 22:06.847
Oh, well, it's...
[laughs]

22:06.890 --> 22:08.849
I'm not sure what
to do with myself.

22:08.892 --> 22:12.026
I mean, hold her hand
and be there for her

22:12.069 --> 22:15.159
in case she wakes up, or stay
here and help find the bastards

22:15.203 --> 22:18.075
who did this to her.No. No, sir.
Go be with her.

22:18.119 --> 22:20.382
We're gonna find the guys
who did this to her, and

22:20.426 --> 22:22.166
we'll get those evidence
kits back, intact.

22:22.210 --> 22:23.994
I promise you that.

22:24.038 --> 22:27.258
Oh. First rule
of law enforcement:

22:27.302 --> 22:29.086
never promise results
when you can't guarantee,

22:29.130 --> 22:32.394
100%, the outcome just
to make somebody feel better.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.135
I thought I taught you
better than that.

22:34.178 --> 22:37.138
You did. But we know how
important this is to you,

22:37.181 --> 22:38.748
so we're gonna get it done.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.316
Go be with Rebecca, sir.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.927
Uh, all right.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.973
Thanks, Hondo.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.202
STREET:
Man, these ladies
look like linebackers.

22:58.246 --> 22:59.900
Matanis are a very
close-knit family.

22:59.943 --> 23:00.944
The four sisters
act as bodyguards.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.206
TAN:
Yeah, too bad they're criminals.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.121
We could use 'em
in the LAPD football league.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.601
Okay, so what's the plan, Deac?

23:05.645 --> 23:07.342
We take out the four sisters
with non-lethal force, hard.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.822
And then we pray that Matani

23:08.865 --> 23:10.606
hasn't destroyed the rest
of the evidence kits.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.042
[indistinct conversations]

23:12.086 --> 23:14.001
All right, Street,
you're with me on the one side

23:14.044 --> 23:15.698
for better vantage. The three
of you stay on the 1-4 corner.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.483
You got it.Let's go.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.010
Let's move.Go. Go.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.060
[women groaning]

23:30.104 --> 23:32.889
[quietly]:
Nobody move. Hands down.

Matani, you're under arrest!

LAPD!STREET:
On your stomach!

23:44.684 --> 23:46.120
WOMAN:
Run, baby!

23:53.083 --> 23:55.042
Deac, the fire!

24:01.135 --> 24:03.050
Check every inch
of this house.

24:03.093 --> 24:04.617
Find every last DNA kit.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.357
On it, man. Let's go.

24:06.401 --> 24:08.229
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Dr. Kipper, you're needed

24:08.272 --> 24:09.883
in Labor and Delivery.

24:09.926 --> 24:11.580
Dr. Kipper
to Labor and Delivery.

24:11.624 --> 24:15.236
You good, Commander?

24:20.154 --> 24:22.417
Ah.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.986
Here you go.[sighs]

24:26.029 --> 24:28.031
Whatever happened
with you

24:28.075 --> 24:29.859
and that woman Janice
you were seeing?

24:29.903 --> 24:32.079
Hmm? She seemed nice.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.081
Well, Janice was okay.

24:34.124 --> 24:35.909
She was, um...

24:35.952 --> 24:37.388
Well, she-she wasn't...

24:37.432 --> 24:39.739
Mom?

24:41.262 --> 24:43.177
Exactly.

24:44.265 --> 24:47.181
None of them will
ever be Mom.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.184
But that doesn't mean that

24:50.227 --> 24:52.142
you can't find someone
to have a happy life with.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.493
Why are you so concerned
with my personal life?

24:54.536 --> 24:56.712
Shouldn't it be
the other way around?

24:56.756 --> 24:58.322
'Cause you have a
lot of years left,

24:58.366 --> 25:00.063
and it makes me sad

25:00.107 --> 25:02.326
thinking of you
spending them alone.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.025
Yeah.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.158
You know how guilty
I felt when I left

25:08.202 --> 25:09.595
to take the job
in Pittsburgh?

25:09.638 --> 25:12.075
I knew once I left,
you'd sit in the house,

25:12.119 --> 25:14.948
sipping coffee, listening to the
records you and Mom collected.

25:14.991 --> 25:17.559
Don't ever feel guilty
for living your life.

25:19.082 --> 25:22.172
Look, I... I'm not lonely.

25:22.216 --> 25:25.306
All right? With SWAT, I have
all the excitement I can handle.

25:25.349 --> 25:29.223
You know Mom would have
wanted you to find someone.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.791
You know, whenever
I'd have a hard shift,

25:31.834 --> 25:33.444
I'd come home,
I'd go straight to my den.

25:33.488 --> 25:35.316
I'd stay in there for hours,

25:35.359 --> 25:37.579
having a couple of drinks,
decompressing.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.321
Your mother understood
when to leave me alone.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.584
We got each other.

25:42.628 --> 25:45.239
I'm never gonna find that again.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.636
Rebecca-- she told me

25:50.679 --> 25:53.290
to never say anything to
you, but you need to know.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.902
Once you got used
to Mom being gone,

25:55.945 --> 25:58.208
Rebecca thought...
thought maybe

25:58.252 --> 26:00.646
your relationship could become
more than just friends.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.648
[chuckles]:
Rebecca?

26:02.691 --> 26:04.563
She never said anything
like that to me.

26:04.606 --> 26:07.870
Yeah, well, you never really
understood women, did you?

26:07.914 --> 26:09.742
She didn't want to risk
turning your friendship

26:09.785 --> 26:12.701
into something that she
could never live up to.

26:12.745 --> 26:15.748
I mean, have you ever
thought about Rebecca

26:15.791 --> 26:17.619
as someone you could love?

26:17.663 --> 26:18.968
I never thought
she'd get over Rick.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.535
That's why we got along so well,

26:20.579 --> 26:22.363
because we both lost
our soul mates, you know?Yeah.

26:22.406 --> 26:25.279
You survived by
leaning on each other.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.763
When she gets
through this,

26:30.806 --> 26:32.895
you two should talk.

26:44.472 --> 26:46.517
Come on.

26:48.476 --> 26:50.347
LUCA:
Got nothing.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.830
We tore the whole place apart.

26:54.874 --> 26:56.919
Where'd you dump the
rest of the evidence kits?

26:56.963 --> 26:58.225
There are no others.
Just mine.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.922
STREET:
Come on, Lolo.
We know you unloaded

26:59.966 --> 27:02.055
your strip clubs to hire
a hit crew to take down

27:02.098 --> 27:03.709
the crime lab.What? No.

27:03.752 --> 27:06.494
I sold the clubs 'cause
I got a call from this dude.

27:06.537 --> 27:07.669
Said he had my evidence kit.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.802
Said he wanted
300 large ASAP

27:09.845 --> 27:12.326
or he'd drop the kit on the
steps of L.A. Superior Court.

27:12.369 --> 27:13.806
So you're telling us
that you paid for your kit,

27:13.849 --> 27:15.503
you didn't steal it?300 large.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.157
Didn't have a choice.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.768
What's this dude's name?Called himself Kraft.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.554
You meet this Kraft in person?

27:23.598 --> 27:24.947
I don't know it was him
or one of his guys,

27:24.991 --> 27:26.557
but I met this dude
with a shaved head

27:26.601 --> 27:27.820
in the parking lot of LAX.

27:27.863 --> 27:31.562
I gave him the cash,
he gave me the kit.

27:31.606 --> 27:34.565
I didn't want to die in jail.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.700
Our real suspect
calls himself Kraft.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.746
Now, he robbed the lab
knowing what the kits are worth

27:40.789 --> 27:42.356
to the criminals
they belong to...So he reaches out

27:42.399 --> 27:44.184
to every criminal
with a major crimes case

27:44.227 --> 27:45.707
and offers to sell them
back their evidence?

27:45.751 --> 27:47.491
Or Kraft would send
'em back to the LAPD.

27:47.535 --> 27:48.971
Sir, this wasn't
about a suspect

27:49.015 --> 27:50.669
stealing evidence so
they could destroy it.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.888
This is the ultimate
underworld blackmail scheme.

27:52.932 --> 27:54.890
Damn, talk about next level.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.979
How is she?She's awake.

27:57.023 --> 27:59.025
Whenever you think
she's good to speak to us.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.330
I'm sure she'll want
to help right away.

28:08.425 --> 28:11.341
They were fast.
They knew the layout.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.909
How to use our key cards.They definitely
had it planned

28:13.953 --> 28:15.084
and knew how to
burn their tracks.

28:15.128 --> 28:16.607
When I hit the floor,

28:16.651 --> 28:20.699
one of their empty shells
rolled towards me.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.877
I hid it in the
temperature control panel,

28:24.920 --> 28:27.706
just in case
there was any evidence on it.

28:27.749 --> 28:28.968
You were bleeding
out from buckshot

28:29.011 --> 28:30.143
while they set
the lab on fire,

28:30.186 --> 28:31.274
and you thought
about saving evidence?

28:31.318 --> 28:34.582
The shell--
it should still be there.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.846
You're a brave woman, Rebecca.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.253
DEACON:
I'm working three jobs,

28:53.296 --> 28:56.038
my ceiling's about to cave in,
I got a baby girl on the way.

28:56.082 --> 28:58.780
H-How do I make these...
these union dues work for me?

28:58.824 --> 29:01.522
How-How do we get
these people to help me?Sergeant, I'm on your side.

29:01.565 --> 29:03.524
And this is not exactly
my area of expertise,

29:03.567 --> 29:05.091
but when I asked
on your behalf,

29:05.134 --> 29:07.484
they said you're already
carrying a sizable balance

29:07.528 --> 29:09.225
on your previous loan.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.532
They're not gonna approve you
for a new one right now.

29:11.575 --> 29:14.013
We've already
appealed it

29:14.056 --> 29:15.841
and there's nothing else
that we can do.

29:15.884 --> 29:19.105
Not through
the department.

29:19.148 --> 29:20.759
The holidays just
keep getting happier.

29:23.674 --> 29:26.721
Thanks for trying.I'm really sorry,
Sergeant.

29:33.902 --> 29:36.252
It's hard to think anything
could've survived in here.

29:36.296 --> 29:38.864
Let's not judge any piece of
evidence until we find it, okay?

29:38.907 --> 29:40.866
Yeah. Fair enough.

29:40.909 --> 29:43.390
Now, she said it was
inside a control panel.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.872
Yup.

29:50.136 --> 29:51.354
I don't see anything.

29:51.398 --> 29:52.921
How far in does it go?

30:04.367 --> 30:06.152
Just like Rebecca said.

30:06.195 --> 30:08.371
Thanks to Rebecca, we
recovered the only piece

30:08.415 --> 30:10.721
of physical evidence
from the lab robbery.TAN: Forensics lifted

30:10.765 --> 30:12.114
a partial thumbprint,
they completed it with

30:12.158 --> 30:13.594
digital imaging
and we got a match.

30:13.637 --> 30:14.987
HONDO:
John Seeley.

30:15.030 --> 30:18.468
41, in and out of prison
since he was 18 years old

30:18.512 --> 30:20.253
for various armed robberies.Now, Seeley was released

30:20.296 --> 30:22.081
from Folsom a month ago
after serving six years,

30:22.124 --> 30:24.257
didn't bother reporting
to his parole officer.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.128
NIA:
I got in touch
with his last cellmate,

30:26.172 --> 30:27.216
who said all Seeley
talked about

30:27.260 --> 30:28.870
was the LAPD crime lab.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.393
He'd read an article about it
in the Los Angeles Chronicle

30:30.437 --> 30:31.873
and became obsessed with it.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.135
I'll be damned.

30:33.179 --> 30:35.398
I ran his prison ID
computer activity log.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.139
He spent hours
on the Chronicle'swebsite

30:37.183 --> 30:38.837
taking virtual tours
of the crime lab.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.360
NIA:
Seeley had all the
information he needed

30:40.403 --> 30:42.841
online to cook up the
scheme of a lifetime.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.146
Where'd he get the name Kraft?

30:44.190 --> 30:45.365
Check out the byline.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.019
Justin D. Kraft.

30:47.062 --> 30:48.411
Seeley took the reporter's name.

30:48.455 --> 30:49.978
I want plainclothes
detectives shadowing

30:50.022 --> 30:51.719
every one of these suspects
on the evidence list.

30:51.762 --> 30:52.807
And if we don't find Seeley,

30:52.851 --> 30:53.895
we'll follow a buyer
going to him.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.766
All right.

30:59.118 --> 31:01.033
[chuckles]

31:01.076 --> 31:03.078
Wow.

31:03.122 --> 31:05.124
Hey, man, you got a sec?

31:05.167 --> 31:07.126
Yeah sure.
What's up?

31:07.169 --> 31:09.650
I can tell you going through
a hard time right now

31:09.693 --> 31:11.870
and I'd like to help
with some cash.

31:13.088 --> 31:14.742
Listen, I didn't tell you

31:14.785 --> 31:16.439
about my situation
looking for a handout.

31:16.483 --> 31:18.920
No, I know, but I
still want to help.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.531
I mean, you need 16 grand
to fix your pipes, right?

31:21.575 --> 31:23.272
I'll loan it to you,
interest-free.

31:23.316 --> 31:26.058
Just pay me back
at your own pace.

31:26.101 --> 31:28.321
How?However, man. I mean,
I know you're good for it.

31:28.364 --> 31:31.715
Just take your time,
man. I'm in no rush.

31:33.761 --> 31:36.155
[clears throat]
Look, uh...

31:36.198 --> 31:39.462
it m-means a lot, but friendship
and money-- th-they don't mix.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.290
Yeah. But it's me, Deac.That's exactly why

31:41.334 --> 31:43.292
I don't want to ruin
our friendship.

31:46.469 --> 31:48.428
But, believe me,

31:48.471 --> 31:50.169
it means a lot that you offered.

31:53.389 --> 31:55.174
What have we got?

31:55.217 --> 31:57.524
One of the suspects on
the list being surveilled--

31:57.567 --> 31:59.439
Nick Kerostena-- the detectives
sitting on him just called in,

31:59.482 --> 32:01.136
and said he's on the
move acting suspicious.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.529
Kerostena runs a crew
out of Montebello.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.226
He's done time
for counterfeiting,

32:04.270 --> 32:05.836
synthetic cocaine,
assault with a deadly weapon.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.186
Two months ago
we found DNA evidence

32:07.229 --> 32:08.839
linking him to the murder

32:08.883 --> 32:10.841
of his mistresses' boyfriend
with a hatchet.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.626
The indictment
was coming down next week.

32:12.669 --> 32:14.802
The detectives tailed Kerostena
to a bar he owns.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.586
He came out ten minutes later
with two bodyguards

32:16.630 --> 32:18.545
and a-a duffel bag they suspect
was filled with cash.

32:18.588 --> 32:20.460
He dumped his phone,
he's headed downtown.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.201
He's got to be meeting
with Seeley.All right, Street.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.203
you tell the detectives
sit tight, don't spook him.

32:24.246 --> 32:26.074
Tell Hondo we're rolling.

32:28.816 --> 32:30.687
SEELEY:
Sorry for the short notice,

32:30.731 --> 32:33.603
but you get this kind of deal's
got to happen fast, right?

32:33.647 --> 32:35.388
Got your end?

32:35.431 --> 32:39.435
Wasn't easy to cash out
a quarter mil in one day.

32:40.654 --> 32:43.004
[zips]

32:43.048 --> 32:44.658
SEELEY:
Everybody wins, amigo.

32:44.701 --> 32:46.921
No eyes, but we got ears
and the deal's going down.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.314
STREET:
Detectives, hold tight.

32:48.357 --> 32:51.099
Don't move in,
SWAT's on its way.

32:51.143 --> 32:52.361
Roger that.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.015
They better hurry.

32:54.059 --> 32:57.105
Great price.
Great product, amigo.

32:57.149 --> 32:58.367
Where is it?

33:11.641 --> 33:12.991
Look familiar?

33:17.082 --> 33:18.474
Then you have a good life,
my friend.

33:18.518 --> 33:19.823
I got other deals to get to.

33:19.867 --> 33:21.390
They made the deal,
we got to go.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.305
SWAT, we're moving in.

33:33.489 --> 33:35.535
LAPD!
Hands where we can see 'em!

33:35.578 --> 33:37.102
Let me see your hands!Let me see your hands!

33:37.145 --> 33:40.235
HONDO: Detectives, take a
perimeter position! Fall back.

33:40.279 --> 33:41.280
STREET:
Man down!

33:47.155 --> 33:48.461
HONDO:
This 20 David to Command.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.941
We are taking fire
from suspects!

33:50.985 --> 33:53.553
Officer down.
Send an ambo!

33:59.863 --> 34:01.952
On the ground!
Drop it right now.Drop the weapon!

34:01.996 --> 34:02.997
On the ground!On the ground!

34:05.913 --> 34:07.871
I got eyes on Seeley!

34:29.110 --> 34:31.112
This is 20-David to 22-David.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.158
I need you to intercept a van
fleeing west on Second.

34:43.037 --> 34:45.213
[siren wailing]

34:50.218 --> 34:52.177
22-David, do you read?

34:52.220 --> 34:54.744
I'm getting beat up by this van.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.224
LUCA:
Roger that. Headed your way!

34:57.965 --> 34:59.836
Aim for the cab, Luca.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.403
[honking]

35:09.542 --> 35:11.239
LUCA:
Hondo, I got him.

35:17.985 --> 35:21.162
Hands on the dash!
Hands on the dash![shouting]

35:21.206 --> 35:23.860
Do not move, bitch-ass.

35:23.904 --> 35:25.558
Don't even look at me.
Don't look at me.

35:35.263 --> 35:36.438
HICKS:
All right.

35:36.482 --> 35:39.267
Okay.

35:39.311 --> 35:41.313
Okay, good.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.407
Thanks to you,
Seeley's in custody.

35:48.450 --> 35:50.887
And they recovered
almost all the DNA kits.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.411
They're on their way
to the L.A. Sheriff's lab

35:52.454 --> 35:54.152
for proper storage.

35:54.195 --> 35:56.545
That's why they pay me
the big bucks.

35:56.589 --> 35:59.548
[chuckles]
Yeah, okay.

35:59.592 --> 36:02.334
[chuckles]

36:02.377 --> 36:04.640
Oh...

36:04.684 --> 36:06.642
You know, when you're
feeling a little better...

36:06.686 --> 36:08.296
Hmm?

36:11.560 --> 36:14.737
...I think you and I
should have a conversation.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.220
NIA:
They started testing

36:19.264 --> 36:20.656
the recovered DNA kits.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.702
Initial reports say only
nine of them were compromised

36:22.745 --> 36:24.094
and would be inadmissible
in court.

36:24.138 --> 36:25.313
What happens
to those nine cases?

36:25.357 --> 36:26.532
We start from scratch,

36:26.575 --> 36:28.664
work harder
to find new evidence.

36:28.708 --> 36:31.145
I'm sorry we couldn't
save 'em all.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.321
Don't be.
Could have been a lot worse.

36:33.365 --> 36:35.758
Yeah.

36:35.802 --> 36:37.369
Yeah, I'll always
have your back.

36:37.412 --> 36:40.894
You had mine when
I was in a rough place.

36:40.937 --> 36:43.026
That won't change.

36:43.070 --> 36:45.507
No, it won't.

36:48.162 --> 36:49.903
Merry Christmas.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.344
ANNIE:
Thank you

36:56.388 --> 36:57.476
for volunteering last-minute.

36:57.519 --> 36:59.086
Oh, of course.

36:59.129 --> 37:01.349
This is so much fun.[chuckles]

37:01.393 --> 37:04.396
So, are you all ready for her?

37:04.439 --> 37:06.049
[gasps]

37:06.093 --> 37:08.269
Yep, she's a kicker.[laughs]

37:08.313 --> 37:09.879
Oh, we're a little
stressed with bills,

37:09.923 --> 37:12.708
but I have never been so
excited to have a new child.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.797
Well, you and Deacon
are the best couple I know,

37:14.841 --> 37:16.582
and you two always find a way
to make things work.

37:16.625 --> 37:18.758
[both chuckle]

37:21.064 --> 37:23.806
I heard, uh, Chris took off
to New York with Ty and Kira

37:23.850 --> 37:25.286
to see some shoegaze band.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.114
That sounds bougie and awesome.

37:27.157 --> 37:29.464
Still getting used to her having
a girlfriend and a boyfriend.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.292
I know. You think
we'll get to meet them?

37:31.336 --> 37:32.902
[chuckles]
We'll see.

37:32.946 --> 37:35.383
What're you doing for your,
uh, crazy Christmas plans?

37:35.427 --> 37:37.037
I'm taking my mom to Hawaii.Really?

37:37.080 --> 37:38.908
It's been forever since
we spent real time together.

37:38.952 --> 37:40.301
Nice, man.
She's got to be excited.

37:40.345 --> 37:41.607
She's been packing
for two weeks.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.391
[chuckles]
What about you?

37:43.435 --> 37:46.046
You know I love how everybody
leaves L.A. for the holidays.

37:46.089 --> 37:48.440
Nothing better than empty
freeways, so I can open up

37:48.483 --> 37:50.398
my '68 Chevy on the 170.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.487
And spend some time
with my folks.Nice.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.402
Holiday treat, anyone?[chuckles]

37:54.446 --> 37:56.317
You bake these
yourself, Street?

37:56.361 --> 37:58.232
99 Cents Store.Nice.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.321
Hey, uh, who's that
with Annie?

38:00.365 --> 38:01.975
That's Molly.
And that is a woman

38:02.018 --> 38:03.324
you definitely
want to stay away from.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.760
She's Hicks' daughter.

38:04.804 --> 38:06.371
Oh, really?

38:06.414 --> 38:08.286
Dude. You finally worked
your way back onto SWAT.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.636
It's not a good idea to hump
and dump the boss' daughter.

38:10.679 --> 38:12.028
What?
I didn't even say anything.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.595
Yeah, Luca,
give Street some credit.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.423
It's not like
he's always thinking up new

38:15.467 --> 38:16.946
and fascinating ways
to lose his job.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.078
Ha, ha, ha.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.340
Hey, heads up, girls.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.559
Excuse me.Be good.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.561
Yeah.

38:22.604 --> 38:24.519
Something sweet, ladies?

38:24.563 --> 38:27.957
Ooh, how about an ice cream with
melted gummy bears and olives?

38:28.001 --> 38:30.482
Sorry, that's the most
popular item on the menu,

38:30.525 --> 38:32.179
and we just ran out.Mm.

38:32.222 --> 38:33.528
And for the young lady?

38:33.572 --> 38:35.443
Uh. Oh, thanks,
I'm okay.

38:35.487 --> 38:37.271
Oh, come on.
It's Christmas season.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.881
You got to sip hot chocolate
during Christmas.

38:38.925 --> 38:40.709
It's the law.

38:40.753 --> 38:43.408
Hmm. Well, my dad's a cop, and
I've never heard about that one.

38:43.451 --> 38:44.713
Well, it just
recently passed.

38:44.757 --> 38:46.324
Hmm.

38:46.367 --> 38:47.629
Don't make me
take out my cuffs.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.849
[chuckles]

38:49.892 --> 38:52.068
Oh, this is good.

38:52.112 --> 38:54.636
I'm Molly.Jim Street.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.377
[clears throat]

38:56.421 --> 38:59.119
Hey, Commander.
Hey, uh, I never got to say,

38:59.162 --> 39:01.121
but the way you handled
those gunmen,

39:01.164 --> 39:03.558
impressive shooting, sir.

39:03.602 --> 39:05.299
You'd be amazed
at what I'm capable of

39:05.343 --> 39:07.345
when it comes to protecting
the ones I love.

39:10.565 --> 39:12.524
What?

39:12.567 --> 39:14.656
Don't make me have to get
involved in your love life.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.442
Oh, give me a break.
How's Rebecca?

39:17.485 --> 39:19.922
Exhausted, but she's
in good spirits.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.360
Hmm. Oh, uh,
so you know, I decided

39:22.403 --> 39:24.231
to take the rest
of December off for work.

39:24.274 --> 39:25.537
Hope you don't mind
me sticking around

39:25.580 --> 39:27.539
through the holidays.

39:27.582 --> 39:30.498
It's okay. You're welcome
to stay as long as you want.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.935
[chuckles]
It's an amazing turnout, huh?

39:32.979 --> 39:34.502
Ah, it's incredible.

39:34.546 --> 39:37.157
It's almost double
the fundraising from last year.

39:37.200 --> 39:41.509
Job well done, Deac.
So, here. Merry Christmas.

39:41.553 --> 39:43.511
Hey, bubba.

39:43.555 --> 39:44.817
[babbling]

39:47.210 --> 39:48.603
Hey... Luca, come on,
I can't...

39:48.647 --> 39:50.257
I can't do this.
It's not me.

39:50.300 --> 39:51.824
Yeah, well,
then do it for me, okay?

39:51.867 --> 39:53.695
'Cause I want to be happy
for the holidays,

39:53.739 --> 39:56.568
and what makes me happy
is when my friends

39:56.611 --> 39:58.352
don't have to worry about money.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.833
All right?

40:00.876 --> 40:02.791
Okay.

40:02.835 --> 40:05.577
I'm gonna pay you back,
every cent.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.839
I know you will.

40:06.882 --> 40:08.318
Love you, bud.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.718
I could...Hey, hey, hey, little man.

40:16.762 --> 40:19.460
You're not supposed to be doing
that without adult supervision.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.157
Oh, I'm so sorry, Officer.

40:21.201 --> 40:23.072
I took my eyes off him
for one second.

40:23.116 --> 40:24.465
Get over here.

40:26.641 --> 40:28.208
Donnie, apologize to the officer

40:28.251 --> 40:29.731
for touching things
you're not supposed to.

40:29.775 --> 40:31.211
Sorry, Officer.

40:31.254 --> 40:32.778
Hey, it's all good.

40:32.821 --> 40:35.171
I just don't want you getting
hurt, that's all.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.870
Donnie wants to be a cop
when he gets older.

40:37.913 --> 40:40.176
I guess he thought he'd just
start his training early.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.700
Is that right?

40:41.743 --> 40:43.832
You want to be a police
officer one day, huh?

40:43.876 --> 40:47.314
Hell yeah.
Or, I mean, yes, Officer.

40:47.357 --> 40:48.881
What part of the city
are y'all from?

40:48.924 --> 40:50.491
Watts. We took the bus up.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.667
You know, you're one
lucky little dude

40:52.711 --> 40:54.539
to have a mama like that.

40:54.582 --> 40:56.497
I'm lucky to have one, too.

40:56.541 --> 40:57.672
I hope you take
good care of her.

40:57.716 --> 40:59.892
He does.
What's your two jobs?

40:59.935 --> 41:01.328
Uh, do good in school,

41:01.371 --> 41:02.938
and help Mom with chores
around the house.

41:02.982 --> 41:04.766
You got yourself one great
little son right here.

41:04.810 --> 41:06.289
[chuckles]

41:06.333 --> 41:07.682
You know what
this thing's called?

41:07.726 --> 41:09.554
No. What?

41:09.597 --> 41:11.904
It's called an
A-Star police chopper.

41:11.947 --> 41:13.688
We use it to save lives.

41:13.732 --> 41:15.211
Cool.

41:15.255 --> 41:17.866
You mind if I take him off your
hands for a few minutes?

41:17.910 --> 41:19.564
Go right ahead.Come on, Donnie.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.566
Hup!
[grunts]

41:21.609 --> 41:25.178
So, what's the best part
about being a police officer?

41:25.221 --> 41:28.660
Well, I'd have to say...

41:28.703 --> 41:31.010
seeing people
who are hurting,

41:31.053 --> 41:33.708
and doing something
to make them feel better.

41:37.016 --> 41:38.887
When I see people do bad things,

41:38.931 --> 41:41.063
I wish I could make them stop.

41:41.107 --> 41:42.978
You know what you're
gonna need for all that--

41:43.022 --> 41:44.632
whole bunch of training.

41:44.676 --> 41:46.721
You want to learn how
to fly this bad boy?

41:46.765 --> 41:47.809
Yeah.

41:47.853 --> 41:49.332
[chuckles]
All right.

41:49.376 --> 41:51.683
Let's see what you got.
Get up there.

41:51.726 --> 41:54.599
All right, get in there.
You're the pilot today.

41:54.642 --> 41:58.037
Let's get you a helmet,
so you can look official.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.343
There you go.

42:00.387 --> 42:02.432
Let's see what kind of
LAPD police officer

42:02.476 --> 42:03.695
little Donnie's
gonna be.

42:03.738 --> 42:06.436
Ah, there you go.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.395
Take us up, Donnie,
take us up.
