WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:02.679
MALE NARRATOR: Previously on Grimm.

00:02.735 --> 00:03.840
Aunt Marie?

00:03.903 --> 00:06.975
The misfortune of our family
is already passing to you.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.178
We have the ability to
see what no one else can.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.054
You are one of the last Grimms.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.018
What did you say you were?

00:14.247 --> 00:15.453
"Blutbad."

00:15.582 --> 00:18.495
Vulgarized by your ancestors
as the "Big Bad Wolf. "

00:18.818 --> 00:19.853
You.

00:24.657 --> 00:26.967
When they lose control
they can't hide

00:27.027 --> 00:29.633
and we see them for
what they really are.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.369
Is she dead? DR. ROSE: No.

00:31.431 --> 00:32.637
He was there.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.237
We'll just have to try again.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.460
Oh!

01:34.561 --> 01:36.234
Nirvana!

01:39.032 --> 01:40.067
Oh!

01:40.733 --> 01:42.610
Why weren't we born rich?

01:42.669 --> 01:45.411
'Cause our parents
didn't have any money.

01:46.306 --> 01:47.341
Hmm.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.089
Shall we go on our yacht, darling?

01:53.146 --> 01:54.489
Which one?

02:05.425 --> 02:07.336
Slow down. Oh, you wish.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.608
Gilda?

02:14.901 --> 02:18.314
Where do you think you're going?

02:33.219 --> 02:34.994
Catch me if you can.

02:36.856 --> 02:37.960
Oh, I can.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.036
Gilda? Come on.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.200
What was that? What?

03:17.263 --> 03:18.640
I think I heard a car.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.870
No, you didn't.

03:20.066 --> 03:22.910
Rocky! Stop!
Go look out the window.

03:23.102 --> 03:25.013
What, now? Yeah. Go!

03:29.075 --> 03:32.181
Somebody's here. You're right.
Come on. Let's go.

03:33.813 --> 03:36.259
Oh! No, no, not the door.
The window.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.556
Come on.

03:39.452 --> 03:40.829
Shh!

03:42.188 --> 03:44.168
em it.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.897
You okay? Yeah, I'm fine.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.605
Come on. Let's go. Hurry up!

03:58.371 --> 04:00.044
Rocky, what are you doing?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.475
Come on.

04:34.707 --> 04:36.482
Are you still dizzy?

04:36.743 --> 04:38.086
I'm all right.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.124
Well, your liver
enzymes are elevated.

04:40.179 --> 04:43.683
And we found traces of a
neurotoxin in your blood.

04:43.750 --> 04:47.288
PHTX3, which usually is
associated with a spider bite.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.226
Lucky you didn't get more of it

04:49.289 --> 04:51.895
or it would have
paralyzed your lungs.

04:52.492 --> 04:55.962
Well, if you feel lightheaded
or feverish, come on back.

04:57.730 --> 04:58.902
Right.

05:02.902 --> 05:04.245
They find anything wrong with you?

05:04.470 --> 05:05.972
Just a few toxins in the blood.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.144
Just a few toxins?
Like the kind that can kill you?

05:08.775 --> 05:10.083
Well, apparently not.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.816
You gonna be okay?

05:12.111 --> 05:13.146
How do I look?

05:13.212 --> 05:14.850
Like a cop who's been
working all night.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.518
Oh, that's funny, Hank.
That's how you look.

05:16.582 --> 05:18.562
Well, then you look good.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.159
Marie?

05:22.555 --> 05:24.091
She's not stable.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.761
We can't allow anyone
in the ICU yet.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.093
Well, when can I talk to her?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.605
After we're done running the tests.

05:30.296 --> 05:32.503
We can't risk letting her
slip back into a coma.

05:33.232 --> 05:36.076
I'll call you the minute
we know something.

05:41.607 --> 05:44.247
ID anyone who wants
access to the room.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.118
How is she?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.489
Well, she came out of the coma

05:49.549 --> 05:50.960
but they're still running tests.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.760
So when did the attack happen?

05:52.819 --> 05:54.628
About ten minutes after I got here.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.896
She came up behind me,
she had a syringe in her hand.

05:58.591 --> 05:59.797
How do you know she wasn't a nurse?

06:00.093 --> 06:02.073
Well, she stuck a needle
in me and she ran away.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.099
Well, you think you
can identify her?

06:05.164 --> 06:06.541
Yeah, she should be
on the security tapes.

06:06.599 --> 06:07.600
I grabbed them when I got here.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.010
They're on their way
to the precinct.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.843
Let's take a look at those tapes.

06:10.903 --> 06:13.907
If we got another killer on our hands,
we better get on this.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.417
WOMAN OVER P.A.
: Respiratory therapist to 342.

06:17.477 --> 06:20.117
Respiratory therapist
on call to 342.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.822
When's the last time you
saw your aunt before this?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.733
Not for a couple years.
I don't know what she's been up to.

06:37.029 --> 06:38.030
That's her.

06:39.766 --> 06:40.870
Was she alone?

06:41.200 --> 06:42.838
She's the only one I saw.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.143
It would be difficult to
make an ID from the back.

06:45.204 --> 06:46.842
Is this all you got? Yeah.

06:48.641 --> 06:52.111
Well, let me know if you get
something we can work with.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.288
Dude, what did your aunt do
to piss off so many people?

06:55.548 --> 06:56.959
Work for the government
or something?

06:57.016 --> 06:59.929
I had a DUI out on Highway
Two about an hour ago.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.698
Driver's got some crazy story

07:01.754 --> 07:04.667
about her boyfriend being attacked,
name's Gilda Darner.

07:10.229 --> 07:11.572
What do you think?

07:11.631 --> 07:13.201
Grown up way too fast,

07:13.266 --> 07:15.405
single parent if she has any,

07:15.468 --> 07:20.008
takes way too many chances and looks
for excitement in all the wrong places.

07:20.072 --> 07:21.574
Sounds like me.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.211
Yeah. Look how you turned out.

07:27.814 --> 07:28.884
Gilda Darner?

07:40.760 --> 07:43.172
This is the house.
This is where it happened.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.667
Somebody got here before us.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.872
Stay in the car.

07:54.874 --> 07:55.944
What are you doing here?

07:56.008 --> 07:57.578
I haven't even called it in yet.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.247
What do you got?

07:59.545 --> 08:00.853
Breaking and entering.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.789
Mr. and Mrs. Rabe got back from
Seattle a couple of hours ago,

08:03.850 --> 08:05.796
found their house broken into.

08:05.852 --> 08:06.990
Somebody raided the fridge,

08:07.053 --> 08:08.657
hit the liquor cabinet,
tried on some clothes

08:08.821 --> 08:10.357
and test-drove a couple of beds.

08:10.423 --> 08:11.902
Any sign of violence? No.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.562
No blood. No body parts.

08:13.626 --> 08:16.163
Only stains we've come up
with are wine and whoopee.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.367
Who's her missing boy toy?

08:17.430 --> 08:18.738
Says his name's Rocky.

08:18.798 --> 08:22.268
Still trying to figure out how
much of her story is true.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.906
Well, she's copping to the B and E,
so some of it is.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.479
Where are the owners? Upstairs.

08:29.308 --> 08:31.652
Somebody was sleeping in our bed.

08:31.878 --> 08:34.950
Sleep had nothing to do with
what they were doing in our bed.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.994
You have an alarm system?

08:37.049 --> 08:39.586
Well, we've been a little
lax in using it lately.

08:39.652 --> 08:40.892
We're pretty remote out here.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.159
I mean we've never
had a problem before.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.865
You should see the living room.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.935
Nothing was stolen?

08:50.997 --> 08:53.409
I don't know yet. Nothing obvious.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.308
You have quite a collection.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.472
Is that a Fijian war club?

09:00.039 --> 09:01.814
Yes, actually it is.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.649
And a New Guinea tribal fork.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.120
This is some valuable stuff.

09:05.177 --> 09:06.656
You know your aboriginal art.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.654
I've never seen one
like that before.

09:08.814 --> 09:11.988
It's Germanic, very rare,
from about 900 A.D.

09:12.718 --> 09:16.188
We belong to organizations that
protect native land from development.

09:16.455 --> 09:18.594
There's a lot of rich
cultural heritage disappearing

09:18.658 --> 09:21.332
and we're trying to protect what's left,
both locally and globally.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.806
Honey, I think you're
getting a little irrelevant.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.005
Well, you have to respect your
ancestors. Right, Detective?

09:27.199 --> 09:31.113
I had to respect mine, otherwise
I couldn't sit down for a week.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.183
Anyone else have access to
the house when you were away?

09:35.241 --> 09:36.652
Just our cleaning people.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.847
And our son, Barry,
who's staying with friends.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.451
And our neighbors, the Colberts,

09:40.513 --> 09:44.427
who check on our house from time
to time when we're out of town.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.360
"Fijian war club"?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.163
Second wife was an anthropologist.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.699
So there were two
people in that house?

09:54.193 --> 09:55.365
So where's Gilda's boyfriend?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.238
My guess, Rocky's home
right now sleeping it off.

10:36.535 --> 10:38.537
So you do this for kicks?

10:38.971 --> 10:40.848
Break into homes, party hard?

10:40.906 --> 10:42.146
We were just having fun!

10:42.208 --> 10:43.585
Illegal fun.

10:43.909 --> 10:47.755
Gilda, you said after you dropped out
of the window you heard Rocky scream,

10:47.813 --> 10:50.384
you started running away from the
house and something chased you?

10:50.449 --> 10:51.519
Yes.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.726
It's my fault.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.923
I shoulda gone back for him but

10:59.291 --> 11:01.168
I just left him there.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.369
I left him there.

11:04.630 --> 11:08.203
Please. Please,
you've gotta do something.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.624
Gilda, do you have any
idea who was chasing you?

11:25.117 --> 11:26.892
A man? A dog?

11:29.221 --> 11:30.427
Some kind of animal?

11:30.656 --> 11:32.329
I... I don't know.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.530
I don't know.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.598
I couldn't really get
a good look at it.

11:36.662 --> 11:39.836
I was so scared I just
wanted to get out of there.

11:43.803 --> 11:47.615
I know that something
terrible has happened to him.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.659
They went to Rocky's house.
Rocky wasn't there.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.789
We talked to his dad, truck driver,

12:00.853 --> 12:03.231
just got back night before last,
hasn't seen Rocky.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.200
What about his mother?
Died when he was a kid.

12:05.257 --> 12:07.168
Did he have a cell phone? Used to.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.537
Dad said they had to cut
back on expenses so...

12:09.595 --> 12:11.302
Did he have any idea
where his son might be?

12:11.363 --> 12:13.434
He said if you find his pick-up,
that's where he'll be.

12:13.499 --> 12:14.773
Well, his truck's
already been impounded.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.144
Gilda was driving it last night.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.541
That's all I got.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.344
What if their little
party got out of hand,

12:24.410 --> 12:26.412
Rocky got hurt,
maybe he fell down the stairs?

12:26.812 --> 12:29.053
Maybe Gilda pushed him,
broke his neck.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.219
Gilda got scared.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.319
Dumped his body in a
river or into the woods.

12:32.384 --> 12:33.761
Now she's trying to make it
look like she's innocent.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.790
I don't think she's trying
to cover anything up.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.665
It seems to me she's
pushing us to find him.

12:38.724 --> 12:41.500
I think we have to take another
look at that house they broke into.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.303
Hello?

12:46.665 --> 12:48.338
I need to see you.

12:49.001 --> 12:50.071
Now.

12:50.402 --> 12:54.578
She's very weak, but I realize
you may not have much time.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.185
I'll be right outside.

13:08.654 --> 13:10.258
I was afraid I'd lost you.

13:10.656 --> 13:11.828
Not yet.

13:12.424 --> 13:14.335
You're all I have left.

13:16.061 --> 13:17.165
I don't want this to happen.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.669
I know.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.367
But you'll be all right.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.071
I don't feel like I'm
gonna be all right.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.883
I'm still trying to make
sense of everything.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.612
If you hadn't been here,
I would have lost my mind.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.546
And I'm not sure I haven't.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.189
Don't doubt yourself.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.157
I've seen so much.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.558
And you'll see more.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.997
You have a responsibility
that you cannot ignore.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.199
I couldn't ignore it if I tried it.

13:44.623 --> 13:47.069
You have to hunt down the bad ones.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.534
Just like your ancestors did.

13:50.229 --> 13:52.175
There's a reason that you're a cop.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.541
You have an ability
and you must use it,

13:55.401 --> 13:57.005
no matter what happens to me.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.184
I'll go get a doctor. No.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.081
The Reapers followed me here.

14:04.610 --> 14:05.748
That means there could be more.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.452
How many are there?

14:07.513 --> 14:08.548
Nobody knows.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.161
They're a secret organization
dedicated to killing us.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.021
You mean Grimms?

14:14.086 --> 14:15.292
There are more like us?

14:15.354 --> 14:16.424
Yes.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.060
But I don't have contact with them.

14:18.557 --> 14:19.831
What about the things
that I've been seeing?

14:19.892 --> 14:21.337
How many more of those are there?

14:21.393 --> 14:23.270
There are more in the
books than I've ever seen.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.676
You must not let the trailer be found.
They don't know it exists.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.414
I hope I haven't done more harm
than good by coming to you.

14:36.976 --> 14:39.582
Let her rest.
You can come back later.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.197
How is she?

14:52.258 --> 14:53.396
Well, she's dying of cancer

14:53.459 --> 14:55.302
and she's had two
attempts made at her life.

14:55.361 --> 14:57.967
Other than that she's
doing all right.

15:00.866 --> 15:02.243
She's one tough lady.

15:02.301 --> 15:03.803
I had no idea.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.806
So you got anything on the Rabes?

15:05.871 --> 15:08.750
Yeah. Their house sits
on about 200 acres,

15:08.974 --> 15:10.851
backs up onto the national forest.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.787
Five hundred square miles
of trees behind them.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.518
Lots of places for
Rocky to get lost.

15:17.182 --> 15:19.355
These woods are too
big for the two of us.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.659
Let's get some people out here.

15:26.892 --> 15:28.098
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look out.

15:52.384 --> 15:53.454
Hey.

15:54.586 --> 15:55.997
Nice riding.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.564
Oh, I hope we didn't scare you.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.968
Oh, no. You guys are lucky
you didn't get thumped.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.498
Look, we knew what we were doing.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.271
That's a good thing 'cause I
hate cleaning blood off my car.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.776
You guys here for my parents?

16:07.066 --> 16:09.046
Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin.

16:09.201 --> 16:11.909
You're Barry Rabe.
You live here, right?

16:14.006 --> 16:15.417
You guys ever seen either of them?

16:17.443 --> 16:18.717
Oh, no, take your time.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.323
Make sure you don't know
them from school or anything.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.689
Look, we've never seen them before.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.956
Boys, dinner's ready. Wash up.

16:26.418 --> 16:27.590
What are you doing back here?

16:27.853 --> 16:29.560
Did you find out who
broke into our house?

16:29.621 --> 16:30.656
Yeah, I think so.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.499
Frank, you should come out here.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.205
Ma'am, can you take
a look at these?

16:35.260 --> 16:36.432
The girl's already in custody

16:36.495 --> 16:38.805
but we haven't seen the guy yet.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.604
Have you ever seen
either of these guys?

16:42.735 --> 16:43.770
No.

16:43.936 --> 16:44.937
Me either.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.610
Hey, Barry, you didn't happen to
come home last night, did you?

16:47.806 --> 16:51.219
He was staying at Jason and
T.B.'s house while we were gone.

16:51.276 --> 16:54.120
Sorry, Mrs. Rabe. We have to ask,
just in case he saw the boy leave.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.319
No, I didn't get home
until this morning,

16:56.749 --> 16:58.160
after my parents got back.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.257
No, I... I didn't see him.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.303
How far away do you guys live?

17:07.393 --> 17:08.394
What is this?

17:09.228 --> 17:11.606
Look, we're just trying to figure
out where everybody was last night.

17:11.663 --> 17:12.800
We know they broke into your house

17:12.865 --> 17:14.310
but no one's seen the
boy since last night.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.512
The girl said she heard a scream
inside the house after she left.

17:17.569 --> 17:21.415
And you believe someone who broke into
our house, drank our wine, ate our food,

17:21.473 --> 17:23.281
and took advantage of our bedroom?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.321
I think you'd be better off
looking under a few rocks.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.892
I wish you'd remember that
we're the victims here.

17:29.948 --> 17:32.053
Boys, let's go in the house.

17:34.586 --> 17:38.534
If you wanna talk to me you can
call me tomorrow at my law firm.

17:42.528 --> 17:45.031
Man, we really hit a nerve.

17:50.936 --> 17:53.212
Let's run some phone records,
pin down where everyone was last night.

18:10.656 --> 18:11.999
She came out of the coma.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.400
And I've had to put guards on her.

18:13.659 --> 18:14.729
What do you want me to do?

18:14.793 --> 18:16.466
We can't allow her to
tell him anything more.

18:16.528 --> 18:17.598
We need him with us.

18:17.663 --> 18:18.698
Then how do I get to her?

18:18.764 --> 18:20.368
Well, you don't.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.101
But you get somebody who can.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.373
With guards on her?

18:23.435 --> 18:24.470
Don't worry about that.

18:24.536 --> 18:27.710
Just find the right people,
and I do mean people.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.280
We can't afford someone
getting excited

18:29.341 --> 18:30.513
and blowing the whole thing.

18:32.244 --> 18:33.917
Don't you know this
is a bad neighborhood?

18:34.546 --> 18:36.651
How much is it worth for
you not to get hurt?

18:37.149 --> 18:39.652
Don't worry.
I'll take care of this,

18:53.432 --> 18:54.968
Nick?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.704
Yeah, in here.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.744
I picked up Chinese from Lotus, and

19:02.574 --> 19:03.609
got Voodoo donuts.

19:03.675 --> 19:04.813
Oh, you're the best.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.288
Don't be such a cop.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.450
The donuts are for dessert.

19:11.783 --> 19:13.126
Are we buying a totem pole?

19:14.186 --> 19:17.326
No. I saw one outside a house
of a case I'm working on.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.130
It's some kind of clan of the bear.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.637
"The bear is a messenger
to the supernatural world.

19:21.693 --> 19:24.936
"His position of dominance
in the totemic hierarchy

19:24.997 --> 19:26.943
"is the result of a
common ancestral belief

19:26.999 --> 19:29.275
"in the sanctity of
their territory."

19:29.334 --> 19:32.076
Hmm. ls the totem pole
some kind of clue?

19:32.738 --> 19:35.742
I don't know, but you
make it sound kinda sexy.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.779
It's just the word pole. Mmm-hmm.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.758
I stopped by to see Marie today.

19:43.415 --> 19:45.554
It scared me seeing all the
police in the hospital.

19:45.617 --> 19:48.120
I don't know why anybody
would want to hurt her.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.292
She can't even die in peace.

19:51.757 --> 19:52.963
How you doing with all that?

19:53.158 --> 19:57.072
Well, I'm not doing too good about it,
but, you know, there's nothing I can do.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.575
So I'm putting on my happy face.

19:59.898 --> 20:02.071
I'm not buying that grin.
Put it back.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.274
Okay. Do it.

20:44.109 --> 20:45.349
Ah! That'll work.

21:06.798 --> 21:09.244
Aunt Marie?
What are you doing here?

21:10.535 --> 21:12.515
Remember what I told you.

21:14.539 --> 21:15.643
Okay.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.350
There will be more red...

21:26.885 --> 21:28.455
...when the sun goes down.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.509
You okay?

21:46.905 --> 21:51.183
Yeah. Yeah, just a... A bad dream.

21:51.276 --> 21:52.584
I hope. What was it?

21:56.415 --> 21:59.828
My aunt just stabbed
me in the hand.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.230
What did you do to her?

22:03.689 --> 22:05.225
Nope, just a dream.

22:05.290 --> 22:08.203
But I don't even know where to
begin interpreting that one.

22:08.260 --> 22:11.639
I was trying to let you sleep.
A lot of good that did.

22:15.967 --> 22:18.573
Hey, hey. Where're
you going so early?

22:19.871 --> 22:23.341
I'm operating on a bulldog at 7:00.
I'll call you later.

23:10.655 --> 23:12.464
You have to hunt down the bad ones.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.460
We need to talk.

23:47.526 --> 23:50.029
Not at 6:30 in the
morning we don't.

23:50.962 --> 23:52.066
This is important.

23:52.130 --> 23:56.977
Oh, well, come on in, then.
Have a cup of coffee. Bagel? Cream cheese?

23:57.869 --> 24:01.078
First I wanna thank you for helping
me out with the kidnapping.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.586
A gift basket would've been nice.

24:03.642 --> 24:04.712
How long is this gonna take?

24:04.776 --> 24:07.620
I'm right in the middle
of my Pilates, man.

24:07.779 --> 24:08.883
You ever seen one of these?

24:16.188 --> 24:18.099
Not up close, thank God.

24:20.725 --> 24:23.399
I think Jagerbars use
these for disemboweling.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.498
Now I'm hungry.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.076
Sure you don't want a bagel?

24:28.133 --> 24:29.635
I'm gonna French press
some coffee, too.

24:29.701 --> 24:30.805
Guatemalan Highlands.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.906
Craft-Roasted. Very robust.

24:34.673 --> 24:35.674
What do you know about Jagerbars?

24:35.740 --> 24:37.686
What am I, your
personal Grimmopedia?

24:37.742 --> 24:38.948
No, you're a Blutbad,

24:39.010 --> 24:42.651
and I'm assuming that Blutbad
know about Jagerbaden.

24:42.981 --> 24:44.756
It's just Jagerbars.

24:45.550 --> 24:46.927
You see them like
I see them, right?

24:47.352 --> 24:48.353
Yes.

24:49.588 --> 24:51.363
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure
out what I'm up against here.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.664
Okay, right there.
Don't even compare the two.

24:53.725 --> 24:55.932
We don't rummage like they do.

24:56.728 --> 24:58.435
How'd you run across
a Jagerbar anyway?

24:58.763 --> 25:02.108
Look, I'm working on a case
and I saw a kid turn into one.

25:02.601 --> 25:03.875
That where you got the claw?

25:03.935 --> 25:04.970
No, my aunt had it.

25:05.103 --> 25:08.312
Oh, right, her again.
Aunt Marie, right?

25:08.540 --> 25:10.520
Yeah. I couldn't sleep
the last two nights

25:10.575 --> 25:12.612
thinking old Aunt Marie
was gonna cut off my head

25:12.677 --> 25:14.782
and stick it on a lamp post.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.918
That's how my great grandma
ended up, you know.

25:16.982 --> 25:18.586
Hey, she's still in the hospital.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.596
Oh. Sorry.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.901
They use those claws
in the Roh-Hat.

25:25.323 --> 25:26.393
Roh-Hat?

25:26.458 --> 25:28.165
It's like a Bar Mitzvah
for bears, you know.

25:28.226 --> 25:29.296
A Jager Bar Mitzvah.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.669
It's a very physical thing.

25:30.729 --> 25:34.142
A lot of pounding of
chests and like, wailing.

25:34.799 --> 25:35.869
But who wails anymore?

25:36.001 --> 25:39.574
Supposed to connect with the
primitive beast in all of us.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.979
And believe me.
I do mean all of us.

25:48.179 --> 25:49.283
So what do they do?

25:49.347 --> 25:50.758
It's all about the chase.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.251
What chase?

25:52.317 --> 25:54.820
The Roh-Hat, you know.
Cave man mumbo jumbo.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.662
Let's get some beers and
barbecue and be stupid.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.997
I mean I like to camp
as much as the next guy,

26:00.058 --> 26:02.163
you know, maybe once a year.

26:02.527 --> 26:04.006
You want plain or onion.
I gotta go.

26:04.829 --> 26:07.173
Oh, well. Thanks for stopping by.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.382
What are you drawing?

26:23.014 --> 26:24.288
Jagerbar.

26:26.051 --> 26:27.462
You saw one?

26:30.288 --> 26:32.894
It was a family,
but the boy's the only one I saw.

26:32.958 --> 26:34.596
How old? Eighteen.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.999
That could be a problem
if they're traditional.

26:40.031 --> 26:41.032
Anyone die?

26:41.700 --> 26:44.408
I don't know.
I've got a missing person.

26:45.804 --> 26:46.908
Do you know what the Roh-Hat is?

26:47.639 --> 26:50.210
You're learning. That's good.

26:53.078 --> 26:55.115
It's a rite of passage,
from boy to man.

26:55.981 --> 26:57.790
They do it at sunset.

26:59.884 --> 27:01.488
It isn't pretty.

27:03.521 --> 27:06.593
The red of the sun and
the blood on their hands.

27:15.066 --> 27:16.340
Just got the phone records.

27:16.401 --> 27:18.677
Several calls were made
between 9:00 and midnight.

27:18.737 --> 27:21.081
We triangulated a call made
from Barry Rabe's cell phone

27:21.139 --> 27:23.619
that puts him at his house
at 11:30 that night.

27:23.675 --> 27:24.983
When Gilda was there with Rocky.

27:25.043 --> 27:28.081
Yeah, so Barry's lying and lawyer
dad is running interference.

27:28.346 --> 27:29.825
A lawyer doing a bad thing?

27:29.881 --> 27:30.882
Never heard of that before?

27:30.949 --> 27:31.950
Hey, Nick, can I
talk to you a minute?

27:32.517 --> 27:33.552
Yes, sir.

27:33.618 --> 27:35.962
Listen, I had to pull the guys
guarding your aunt at the hospital.

27:36.087 --> 27:37.122
What?

27:37.188 --> 27:38.223
With no hard evidence
of a second attack

27:38.289 --> 27:39.734
I couldn't justify the
expense to the Chief

27:39.791 --> 27:42.601
without it looking like we're giving
preferential treatment to police families.

27:44.796 --> 27:47.106
I'm sorry but my hands are tied.

28:06.618 --> 28:07.824
Monroe.

28:08.586 --> 28:09.860
Now what?

28:10.455 --> 28:11.695
A Grimm?

28:12.090 --> 28:14.229
Are you out of your mind?
I can't do this.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.370
Look, I just need your help until
I can figure something else out.

28:17.595 --> 28:18.767
I'm not a cop.

28:19.164 --> 28:21.371
Yeah. You're the only one who
knows what I'm dealing with.

28:21.433 --> 28:24.346
No. I am the only one who is
stupid enough to talk to you.

28:24.636 --> 28:25.671
I'll owe you one.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.239
Dude, you already owe me three.

28:27.305 --> 28:28.579
Three? Yeah.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.051
The little girl who was kidnapped,

28:30.108 --> 28:32.782
the Jagerbar at 6:30 this morning

28:32.877 --> 28:34.515
in the middle of my Pilates,

28:34.579 --> 28:35.683
and now this!

28:36.815 --> 28:38.954
Okay. I'll owe you three.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.321
What the hell makes you think

28:40.385 --> 28:42.365
I am gonna stay here
and protect her?

28:43.455 --> 28:45.230
Because I trust you.

28:45.623 --> 28:46.863
Oh, man.

28:46.925 --> 28:49.428
Look, I'll be back
as soon as I can.

28:56.801 --> 28:58.405
Maybe you shouldn't trust me.

29:00.939 --> 29:02.646
What's up? Rocky's dad just called.

29:02.707 --> 29:03.742
Gilda made bail.

29:04.008 --> 29:06.352
She went over to his house and got a gun,
Rocky had in his room.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.481
He couldn't stop her.

29:07.545 --> 29:10.492
She said she was gonna get Rocky back
or kill the people that took him.

29:28.566 --> 29:29.772
Where is he?

29:29.834 --> 29:31.370
Oh, my God. Where is he?

29:31.436 --> 29:32.540
Are you the girl that
broke into my house?

29:32.871 --> 29:34.782
You tell me where
he is or I'll shoot!

29:34.839 --> 29:37.376
Please don't hurt me. I,
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:37.442 --> 29:38.443
You know where he...

29:44.682 --> 29:45.854
Are you okay, Mom?

29:47.252 --> 29:48.526
I am now.

29:48.953 --> 29:50.523
And well done, Son.

29:51.322 --> 29:53.563
Hunting two is better than one.

29:54.159 --> 29:55.832
You make your ancestors proud.

30:00.899 --> 30:01.934
Ah!

30:05.870 --> 30:07.679
Get rid of her truck.

30:23.588 --> 30:24.623
Hi.

30:25.557 --> 30:26.592
Barry home?

30:26.658 --> 30:28.160
No, he's out with friends.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.237
Doing what? I don't know.
Riding their bikes.

30:30.295 --> 30:31.740
God, I hope he doesn't
break his neck.

30:39.470 --> 30:40.540
What do you want?

30:40.605 --> 30:42.949
The woman who broke into your
house is on her way here.

30:43.141 --> 30:44.984
She's not happy She's got a gun.

30:45.143 --> 30:46.816
What? ls everything okay?

30:46.878 --> 30:47.948
Everything's fine.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.013
No, I don't really think so.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.582
Nick, doesn't look
like she's here yet.

30:50.648 --> 30:52.127
I'm going back down the road.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.686
I'll block it off
in case she shows.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.966
We need to talk. Right now.

30:58.256 --> 31:01.601
I know what you are. You know who I am.
So let's cut the crap.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.635
You want to cut the crap?

31:03.695 --> 31:07.837
Okay, you're a Grimm.
You're a danger to my family.

31:08.433 --> 31:10.208
And don't think wearing a
badge is gonna protect you.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.676
This isn't about me.

31:13.571 --> 31:14.879
I know about the hunt.

31:15.006 --> 31:16.076
What are you talking about?

31:16.274 --> 31:17.309
The Roh-Hat.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.445
Nobody does that anymore.

31:18.509 --> 31:19.579
Yes, they do.

31:19.644 --> 31:21.646
And when the sun goes down tonight,
it's gonna be too late.

31:22.146 --> 31:24.057
Look, Barry and those
two boys have got Rocky.

31:24.115 --> 31:25.355
And we don't have a lot of time.

31:27.652 --> 31:29.654
Come on, you're a lawyer.

31:29.754 --> 31:32.633
If they kill this innocent
kid over this stupid hunt

31:32.991 --> 31:34.902
their lives are over.

31:34.959 --> 31:36.836
Where are they? I told you.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.404
Where are they?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.707
Why don't you ask
to see his warrant?

31:44.535 --> 31:45.912
Oh, my God.

31:46.437 --> 31:48.075
I didn't realize.

31:48.539 --> 31:49.574
So what do you wanna do?

31:49.641 --> 31:53.111
You wanna go inside,
have a few drinks, forget about it?

31:53.678 --> 31:54.816
Or do you want to come with me?

31:56.414 --> 31:57.518
Okay.

31:58.316 --> 31:59.886
But we're gonna have to
take my four-wheeler.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.290
You know where they are?

32:01.653 --> 32:04.099
I think I know where they might be.

32:23.041 --> 32:25.783
Requesting backup
at 1534 Wilder Road.

32:41.426 --> 32:44.407
If we find them, promise me
you're not gonna hurt them.

32:44.462 --> 32:45.566
I won't if I don't have to.

32:46.698 --> 32:47.802
Okay.

32:54.939 --> 32:56.384
It's Nick. You got anything?

32:56.441 --> 32:58.079
I found the truck.
She's here somewhere.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.883
I'm with Frank Rabe.
I'm going after the boys.

32:59.944 --> 33:01.651
I'll call you if I get anything.

33:12.223 --> 33:15.261
We're sorry we broke into your house.
We'll never do it again.

33:27.638 --> 33:29.743
Just let her go.

33:29.807 --> 33:30.979
Yeah, we'll let her go.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.279
We're gonna let you go, too.

33:32.643 --> 33:34.645
Don't worry. We'll
give you a head start.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.452
No! Please! No!

33:38.149 --> 33:41.062
Oh, man. You're really scared.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.094
This is ridiculous.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.568
You people murdered my grandfather.

33:53.998 --> 33:56.103
The Grimms burned down his farm,

33:56.467 --> 33:59.209
cut off his head,
his hands and his feet.

33:59.303 --> 34:02.716
Okay, now he deserved it for
some of the things he did.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.253
But if my parents could see me now,

34:04.342 --> 34:07.255
standing this close to you
and not avenging the family,

34:07.979 --> 34:10.585
last Thanksgiving I'd be invited to.
I can tell you that.

34:16.187 --> 34:18.326
Take your best shot, Blutbad.

34:33.036 --> 34:34.710
We have to take the
trail from here.

34:34.772 --> 34:35.944
How do you know they'll be there?

34:36.239 --> 34:37.480
I don't.

35:38.903 --> 35:41.247
Okay, that went a little too far.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.964
There's a cave up ahead.

36:01.592 --> 36:03.469
Let me go first and try
and talk them out of it.

36:04.462 --> 36:05.497
No!

36:06.330 --> 36:08.401
I'm either coming with
you or I'm going alone.

36:29.720 --> 36:30.892
We're too late.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.767
It's started,

36:52.510 --> 36:53.887
Ah! Get up!

37:21.405 --> 37:22.645
Get out!

37:31.115 --> 37:33.186
This isn't gonna get any
better unless you stop.

37:33.584 --> 37:36.895
No! Barry! Son! This is over.

37:38.422 --> 37:39.423
Stay down.

37:40.725 --> 37:42.261
This stops now.

37:43.661 --> 37:44.799
No!

37:46.030 --> 37:47.634
Mom! Don't!

38:13.724 --> 38:15.897
Mom? Mom?

38:16.260 --> 38:18.262
Please, I am so sorry.

38:19.196 --> 38:20.504
You did nothing wrong.

38:21.132 --> 38:24.511
Yeah, he did, Diane. And now we're
all gonna have to pay for it.

38:25.536 --> 38:27.914
You have to respect your ancestors.

38:28.639 --> 38:29.947
Not like this.

38:44.488 --> 38:45.592
Okay. Let's see.

38:45.656 --> 38:49.069
We got kidnapping and attempted
murder for Barry, Jason, and T.B.

38:49.126 --> 38:50.400
Breaking and entering
for Rocky and Gilda.

38:51.362 --> 38:53.569
Well, at least they
weren't doing drugs.

38:53.631 --> 38:54.974
Detective?

38:58.436 --> 39:00.313
She wanted them to
know their heritage.

39:01.238 --> 39:03.184
She never understood
the danger of it.

39:04.442 --> 39:07.048
It isn't easy to
give up your history.

39:08.979 --> 39:10.549
You haven't had to give up yours.

39:11.082 --> 39:13.221
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.321
Hello?

39:17.388 --> 39:19.629
Look, you told me to
protect her and I did.

39:19.690 --> 39:24.139
But, I think I may have
gone a little overboard.

39:24.495 --> 39:27.203
WOMAN OVER P.A.:
Trauma surgeon to OR one, stat.

39:27.264 --> 39:28.971
Trauma surgeon to OR one, stat.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.343
Look, I can't stick around.
Things are getting a little dicey.

39:31.402 --> 39:34.110
You should get down here.
I'm not sure I got all of them.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.511
MALE NURSE: Get security up here!

40:31.762 --> 40:33.366
Remember who you are.

40:33.597 --> 40:36.601
Trust your instincts
and nothing else.

40:47.511 --> 40:48.683
Marie?

40:52.316 --> 40:53.556
Come on.

41:33.023 --> 41:34.263
Goodbye.

41:38.095 --> 41:39.438
Rest well.

41:41.031 --> 41:42.169
Are you all right?

41:44.068 --> 41:45.103
No.

41:54.278 --> 41:55.780
But I will be.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
