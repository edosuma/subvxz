WEBVTT

02:38.575 --> 02:39.409
Hector?

03:24.287 --> 03:27.373
A new night creature. Amazing.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.669
Hector, may we speak?

03:31.753 --> 03:34.255
Well, I can't stop you
from speaking to me.

03:34.339 --> 03:38.843
You're vampire aristocracy, after all.
I'm a simple human smith.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.346
Your skills are a legend.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.599
Our kind has never produced
a forge master.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.809
Well, you didn't have to.

03:46.893 --> 03:50.897
Before the war, night creatures
were simply a species in hiding.

03:52.232 --> 03:56.527
They either reproduced naturally
or were created by acts of wild magic.

03:57.403 --> 04:00.907
Now they are soldiers,
their numbers have to be replenished.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.910
You didn't need forge masters until now.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.956
But your intellect cannot be denied.

04:08.331 --> 04:13.795
-If you say so.
-I do. And Dracula himself clearly agrees.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.464
He listens to you.

04:16.965 --> 04:20.885
As much as he does to Isaac,
which is, frankly, not much.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.973
I believe you are actually worried
about Dracula.

04:28.393 --> 04:32.063
I am. It's not like him to be indecisive.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.316
The fire in him has gone out, somehow.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.445
It's as if we're looking
at the embers of the man.

04:42.156 --> 04:46.536
There are things we can do
that don't require his decisions.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.164
-Oh, I doubt that.
-There are.

04:50.957 --> 04:55.211
It means nothing to the war effort
if we sent a group to the Belmont home

04:55.295 --> 04:57.005
to begin a search for their hold.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.050
Why are you so fascinated by that?

05:01.718 --> 05:04.345
If anyone in all the world
has tools or magic

05:04.429 --> 05:08.182
who can harm our Lord Dracula,
it is in the Belmont trove.

05:08.933 --> 05:13.604
We need to ensure it does not fall
into the wrong hands. Simple.

05:14.772 --> 05:17.233
All right. That is logical.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.319
I agree to that.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.864
But Dracula must approve
the dispensation of troops.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.707
How did you come to be in his service?

05:35.293 --> 05:38.588
I met him over a year ago...
when he was traveling.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.551
-He sought me out, you know.
-Did he really?

05:45.136 --> 05:47.597
I was living in the east of Rhodes,
very quietly.

05:51.642 --> 05:55.772
He'd heard of me from scholars in town,
and looked for me specifically.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.817
We talked for hours.

06:00.985 --> 06:05.865
After his wife died, he came to me,
asking for my help.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.202
Can you imagine?

06:11.204 --> 06:12.288
A man like that...

06:14.624 --> 06:16.417
asking a human for help...

06:18.795 --> 06:20.421
in order to avenge a human?

06:32.183 --> 06:33.184
Master Dracula...

06:34.727 --> 06:35.561
is it you?

06:39.982 --> 06:44.028
Hector... I have need of your skills.

06:44.904 --> 06:49.450
-Tell me what you need.
-I need an army.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.663
The dead must rise
and creatures of the night

06:53.746 --> 06:56.082
must be called into their corpses.

06:57.291 --> 07:01.379
-These are your skills.
-What's happened? Why do you need an army?

07:05.341 --> 07:07.051
They killed my wife.

07:08.970 --> 07:09.804
They?

07:11.556 --> 07:12.723
The humans.

07:14.016 --> 07:18.896
The stupid, vicious, spiteful evil humans.

07:19.480 --> 07:24.527
The humans you renounced.
The humans you live apart from.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.822
They killed my wife.

07:30.408 --> 07:34.120
-I am so sorry.
-No more, Hector.

07:34.620 --> 07:38.499
They must be stopped, culled.

07:41.377 --> 07:44.714
Is this genocide, Dracula?

07:45.590 --> 07:46.966
Would that concern you?

07:48.468 --> 07:52.388
My fellow humans have never treated me
with love, and I've punished them for it.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.809
But I wouldn't have them suffer.

07:58.269 --> 08:03.107
And like any animal, I think the world
would be poorer with their extinction.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.403
I would just see to it
that they couldn't harm anyone else.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.364
Then that is how it shall be.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.535
Vampires feed on humans.
I understand this.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.457
If humans became livestock...

08:21.125 --> 08:24.504
I would have no concern over that
if conditions were...

08:24.587 --> 08:25.713
Humane?

08:27.298 --> 08:28.799
I was gonna say merciful.

08:29.675 --> 08:36.182
Oh, yes. I can promise a merciful end
to the human plague, Hector.

08:37.725 --> 08:38.893
Will you join me?

08:42.271 --> 08:43.105
A cull?

08:44.315 --> 08:45.733
Controlled population?

08:46.901 --> 08:49.278
Making sure they cannot harm
anyone else?

08:50.780 --> 08:51.614
Yes.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.035
He was a giant...

08:57.537 --> 08:58.788
only a year ago.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.083
But now...

09:05.461 --> 09:08.631
It was my understanding that
when a forge master re-animates a thing,

09:08.714 --> 09:12.677
it has total loyalty to the forge master
and his goals.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.719
It does.

09:14.762 --> 09:19.016
Make some troops that you can
trust completely with whatever they find.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.812
And then help me convince Dracula
to attack Braila.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.451
There.

09:39.036 --> 09:39.996
That's my tree.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.417
I used to play in that tree.
We're nearly at the house.

09:50.047 --> 09:52.425
It's hard to imagine you playing.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.929
Yeah. I suppose so.

09:58.264 --> 10:03.019
But it was everything, that tree.
It was my house and my boat and my fort.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.479
Anything I wanted it to be.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.359
Good night, tree.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.311
-This was your home?
-Yeah.

10:47.188 --> 10:50.107
-You grew up here?
-Yeah.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.362
I can't imagine what it was like
to grow up in a single place.

10:56.989 --> 10:57.823
It was...

11:00.159 --> 11:00.993
It was fine.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.121
Wasn't the worst way to grow up.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.583
How old were you
when your family home was taken?

11:09.960 --> 11:12.380
Thirteen, 14, something like that.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.674
You've been on your own since you were 13?

11:17.510 --> 11:20.805
Maybe 12.
Who remembers that sort of thing?

11:21.847 --> 11:22.723
Twelve.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.310
Is there a point to these questions?

11:27.603 --> 11:30.564
I'm disturbed to find that I had
more of a childhood than you did.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.150
And your dad's fucking Dracula.

11:36.112 --> 11:36.946
What?

12:02.638 --> 12:03.764
I think this is it.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.186
Your hidden entrance
looks like a hearthstone.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.398
Just help me clear it.

12:21.615 --> 12:25.453
Congratulations. You have just discovered
a big piece of stone.

12:27.079 --> 12:31.709
-It's the door.
-Do we lift it or...?

12:37.381 --> 12:41.260
That's odd. I don't seem to be able
to get any purchase on it.

12:46.974 --> 12:47.808
I see now.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.269
You won't be able to lift it.

12:51.187 --> 12:56.484
Well, my family got it up somehow.
I was taken down there as a child.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.903
Did you see them lift it?

12:59.862 --> 13:02.740
No, they brought me through it
once it was open.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.784
They told me they'd teach me
how to do it one day.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.661
I supposed there was a special trick.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.832
-Were your parents magicians?
-Not as such.

13:11.916 --> 13:16.253
I mean, they knew a lot, but this door
was put in by one of our ancestors.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.925
Well, I guess the special trick
was passed down the generations,

13:21.675 --> 13:25.262
the way we Speakers transmit knowledge.
Your parents knew the trick,

13:25.346 --> 13:28.682
but didn't know where it came from
or what it really was.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.309
Stand back.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.208
Open sesame.

13:54.750 --> 13:59.630
-Was that an Enochian word?
-Yes, I know that language.

14:00.256 --> 14:04.343
Well, well, naughty Belmonts
hunting the terrible things of the forest

14:04.426 --> 14:07.054
but sitting on a magic door
opened by occult language.

14:07.763 --> 14:11.600
I didn't know it was a fucking magic door.
Doesn't make us black magicians.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.853
But you know that the word  Teloch
means of death, right?

14:14.937 --> 14:18.065
-Shut up.
-It's the magical door of death, Belmont.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.525
Are you coming or what?

14:47.511 --> 14:52.099
Belmont isn't even a Wallachian name.
That just dawned on me.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.728
No. The family's originally
from the Kingdom of France,

14:56.228 --> 14:58.731
but we moved out of there
a few hundred years ago.

14:59.148 --> 15:03.402
-Moved or chased?
-Moved. Thank you very much.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.572
With people behind you
waving pitchforks and torches?

15:06.655 --> 15:11.577
No. No. We're professionals.
We move where the work is.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.996
What does that even mean?

15:15.247 --> 15:17.750
All the dark things moved into the east.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.879
I think it was a Leon Belmont
who entered the region first.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.052
And he built this house

15:29.053 --> 15:31.972
and dug the foundations
for everything under it.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.391
My God.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.065
The memory of my family.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.027
All that's left of us.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.240
Is it organized?
Is there a way to find things?

16:31.907 --> 16:35.369
I imagine one sacrifices a chicken
and divines the location

16:35.452 --> 16:37.830
of the book you want
from the intestines.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.916
Maybe Belmont has a crystal ball
in here you could ask.

16:41.834 --> 16:42.960
Shut up.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.672
It's an impressive tip, Belmont,
but it is, nonetheless, a tip.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.384
Your ancestors were apparently
mentally ill hoarders.

16:50.968 --> 16:54.513
I fully expect to find family cats
mummified under some of these shelves.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.684
Unless your family preferred to eat them?

16:59.643 --> 17:02.312
There's an index on the lectern
at the bottom.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.608
So, this really is a managed collection?

17:07.276 --> 17:10.029
It's the work of generations,

17:10.112 --> 17:12.448
an archive of everything
we've found and learned

17:12.531 --> 17:14.450
since the days of Leon Belmont.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.796
What was your Leon Belmont
doing in Wallachia?

17:32.426 --> 17:33.802
Hunting Dracula.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.684
Here it all is, then.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.228
The last of us.

18:06.627 --> 18:10.089
Bloody hell. Is that what I think it is?

18:10.631 --> 18:14.593
Careful, Trevor. You almost
sounded excited about something.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.975
It couldn't be. Could it?

19:11.066 --> 19:12.151
Beautiful.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.529
What on Earth is that ugly thing?

19:16.780 --> 19:18.824
I don't believe they hid it.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.869
It's the Morning Star.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.590
It's all here. You're right.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.092
This is quite amazing.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.304
Isn't it? It's amazing.

19:41.513 --> 19:45.475
-Charming.
-You're not even a little bit impressed?

19:45.559 --> 19:49.688
It's like a museum dedicated
to the extermination of my people, so, no.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.106
Not thrilled.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.664
May I speak to you?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.001
Approach, Godbrand.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.588
I have a question.

20:16.131 --> 20:16.965
Go on.

20:18.675 --> 20:22.304
If you kill all the humans,
what are we gonna eat?

20:23.513 --> 20:24.348
What?

20:25.224 --> 20:28.644
It's very simple, Dracula.
If you kill all the humans,

20:28.727 --> 20:32.481
where does the continuing supply
of human blood come from?

20:36.068 --> 20:39.696
I allow you to go on feeding raids
when we change location.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.408
I have blood stored in cold canisters.

20:43.492 --> 20:48.163
There are animals in the lower levels.
You won't go hungry, Godbrand.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.958
Not right now, no. But later?

20:51.041 --> 20:55.003
I don't want to be rationing myself
on fucking pig blood.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.882
-Careful.
-Pig blood gives me the shits.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.842
I'm sorry, but there it is.

21:01.551 --> 21:05.222
-You will be taken care of, Godbrand.
-Yes, of course. Right.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.891
Except, what if we're not?

21:07.975 --> 21:10.269
What if you just wanna kill
all the humans,

21:10.352 --> 21:13.855
and you don't leave us enough
to keep in camps to feed from?

21:13.939 --> 21:18.277
I will not be questioned by you.
I have told you how it will be.

21:18.777 --> 21:23.323
The humans will die.
You will be taken care of.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.245
Little Godbrand,

21:29.204 --> 21:33.667
little vampire, little parasite.

21:34.501 --> 21:38.505
Little boat weevil
who delights in making noise

21:38.588 --> 21:42.592
and pretending he is important
and dangerous.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.679
Are you going to continue questioning me?

21:45.762 --> 21:50.392
Are you going to fight me,
little Godbrand?

21:52.936 --> 21:53.770
No.

21:54.438 --> 21:59.109
Then why are you still here
making your little noises?

21:59.192 --> 22:05.032
Get out before I slit you up the middle
and bite out your heart.

22:26.344 --> 22:28.555
And how is our lord and master?

22:28.638 --> 22:31.266
The old man has lost his mind.

22:31.349 --> 22:35.353
He's going to kill all the humans
and leave us without any livestock.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.857
-We're all gonna starve to death.
-Surely not.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.734
I'll tell you another thing.

22:41.401 --> 22:44.362
I still wouldn't wanna try him
in a straight fight,

22:44.446 --> 22:48.825
but I have a strong suspicion
he hasn't fed in a while.

22:49.326 --> 22:52.579
Why would Dracula, of all people,
go without blood?

22:52.662 --> 22:57.417
Because this isn't a war, Carmilla.
It's a suicide.

22:57.501 --> 23:02.339
His wife's dead, and he wants to join her.
And he wants to take all of us with him.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.343
We'll all gonna die. All of us!

23:06.968 --> 23:10.180
-Godbrand, wait.
-I'm not gonna fuck you, Carmilla.

23:10.263 --> 23:13.850
-I'm too pissed off.
-You stupid bastard.

23:23.902 --> 23:28.406
-What the hell was that for?
-To focus your attention.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.033
On what, pain?

23:30.450 --> 23:34.079
On the fact that Dracula
needs to take this castle to Braila.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.415
Let me tell you something.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.545
I was turned, centuries ago,
by a vampire master

23:41.628 --> 23:44.131
who said he was giving me the world.

23:44.714 --> 23:49.219
But, in time, he grew old
and cruel and mad.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.097
And I was bound to him.

23:53.932 --> 23:57.894
Until I decided to take back my world.

23:59.229 --> 24:03.441
I wasn't going to be dictated to
by mad old men anymore.

24:05.318 --> 24:08.113
And then I come here,
to meet with the leader of our nation,

24:08.196 --> 24:09.406
and what do I find?

24:10.490 --> 24:13.034
A mad, cruel old man.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.787
Never again, Godbrand.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.249
Never again.
