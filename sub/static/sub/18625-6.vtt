00:46.713 --> 00:49.132
[man]
What kind of nerd breaks into a museum?

00:49.216 --> 00:51.760
-[camera whirring]
-Move to the middle. Pose.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.099
Okay, come on. No, stop! Next!

00:57.182 --> 00:58.100
[sighs]

00:59.434 --> 01:00.936
[camera whirring]

01:01.019 --> 01:02.104
[man groans]

01:03.188 --> 01:05.607
I can't thank you enough
for coming to the station.

01:05.691 --> 01:08.443
They are so lucky
she didn't press any charges.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.445
Ms. Nomura is a personal friend.

01:10.529 --> 01:14.741
She agrees with me that this was nothing
more than reckless youth run amok.

01:14.825 --> 01:18.662
I mean, who else do you think is hiding
an evil troll face? Coach Lawrence? Steve?

01:18.745 --> 01:21.331
[gasps]
What if Strickler's one of them?

01:21.415 --> 01:24.293
Strickler's been teaching history
at Arcadia Oaks High

01:24.376 --> 01:25.919
since the dawn of history.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.754
If he's one, I'm one.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.756
-[scoffs]
-[groans]

01:29.840 --> 01:31.591
I know where I've seen this bridge.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.261
It's the same one
that Blinky was talking about.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.347
What? The Killa-thingy Bridge?
That's, like, ancient history, right?

01:37.431 --> 01:39.516
They're trying to break Gunmar out.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.394
This is bad, Tobes.
Like, "Goodbye, Arcadia" bad.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.896
As soon as we get home,
we're going to Blinky.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.899
You really didn't have to go through
all this trouble, Mr. Strickler.

01:47.983 --> 01:52.529
Please, "Walter." I'm sorry we had to meet
under this unfortunate circumstance.

01:52.613 --> 01:57.200
There must be some way I can repay you.
Coffee? Dinner? Appendix removal?

01:57.284 --> 02:02.331
I... Coffee would be a delight.
And a rain check on the appendectomy.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.791
Looking forward to it, Walter.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.502
Watch yourself, Young Atlas.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.839
Next time, the consequences
could be more severe.

02:12.466 --> 02:16.178
Did you actually just ask
my teacher out on a date?

02:16.261 --> 02:19.973
Don't you make this about me.
You guys broke into a museum!

02:20.057 --> 02:24.394
And for this? You are grounded
until you apologize to that woman.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.355
-[engine turns over]
-[exhales deeply]

02:26.438 --> 02:27.439
You got me?

02:27.522 --> 02:29.066
-Yes, Mom.
-Yes, Dr. Lake.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.445
[woman]
Arthur! Here, boy!

02:35.656 --> 02:36.990
Sorry, Mom.

02:37.783 --> 02:41.119
Are you certain?
Are you unquestionably, unequivocally--

02:41.203 --> 02:42.204
I'm certain.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.456
-Could be anything.
-I concur.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.000
Tobias' photographic skills
are less than exemplary.

02:47.084 --> 02:51.296
Okay, it's a little blurry! You try taking
a picture while hauling butt, mister!

02:51.380 --> 02:55.634
Okay, well, what about the curator?
How could a person just change like that?

02:55.717 --> 02:58.136
[both speak foreign language]

02:58.220 --> 03:00.639
-What? What is it?
-Changeling.

03:01.723 --> 03:02.974
[all gasp]

03:03.725 --> 03:06.353
[chuckles nervously]

03:06.436 --> 03:07.938
-Not helping.
-Sorry.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.149
Changelings haven't been
talked about in quite some time.

03:11.233 --> 03:14.277
-Do you mind?
-Whatever.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.280
In the Old World, Gumm-Gumms...

03:18.824 --> 03:19.908
Fine.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.245
...stole our young and did something
unnatural to change them.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.123
Their sole purpose:
to spy on the world above.

03:26.206 --> 03:30.043
-What did they do to them?
-Nasty business. Very messy.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.672
These are the very reasons
I doubt your certainty.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.466
I don't question you saw a bridge,
but Killahead?

03:36.550 --> 03:39.511
It would take years to collect
all of the stones. Decades, even.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.514
-You would need an army of changelings.
-I know what I saw.

03:42.597 --> 03:48.520
These are serious accusations, Master Jim.
Without proof, absolute bedlam will ensue.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.147
Well, we have to tell someone.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.775
-This is our city, too.
-Who? Our court-appointed psychiatrist?

03:53.859 --> 03:55.652
They're never going to believe us.

03:55.736 --> 04:00.949
Well, if it isn't the piece of flesh
I'll pound into pancakes tomorrow.

04:01.032 --> 04:04.995
I look forward to your pain
and I'll drink to your death.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.999
Death? What is he talking about?
I thought this was only a rematch.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.710
To challenge a troll's honor
can only end in ruin.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.504
It's all right there in chapter three
of <i>A Brief Recap--</i>

04:14.588 --> 04:16.798
-You still haven't read the book.
-Now, hold on.

04:16.882 --> 04:20.093
This fight, I don't know,
maybe we can, um... postpone it?

04:20.177 --> 04:24.347
Postpone, you say? What a trainer!

04:24.431 --> 04:28.477
Does everyone in your company
forget how to fight?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.646
There are things that have
been brought to our attention.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.648
Things that have serious implications.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.525
No, no, no, Master Jim! Shh!

04:35.609 --> 04:40.071
By Kanjigar's honor, I would have made
your death swift and painless,

04:40.155 --> 04:42.073
but, for that act of cowardice,

04:42.157 --> 04:46.870
I will show you no mercy
when I take back what's rightfully mine.

04:47.537 --> 04:52.375
Bid farewell to your loved ones,
Jim "the Dead Meat." [grunts]

04:52.918 --> 04:56.630
-I'm going to die tomorrow.
-[both sigh]

04:57.255 --> 05:00.592
What was I to do?
The boy turned them on me.

05:00.675 --> 05:04.012
The goblins were supposed to hide
our tracks, not lead them to us!

05:04.095 --> 05:07.516
I will see to it
that your mess is cleaned up.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.610
I'm sorry. You've been compromised.

05:18.693 --> 05:22.030
[growls]
Please, Bular, spare me.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.449
-Groveling, Impure?
-You need me.

05:24.533 --> 05:28.495
If you dispose of me, who will replace me?
The boy already knows I'm a changeling.

05:28.578 --> 05:32.666
How long do you think it will take for him
to find out Strickler is one, too?

05:32.749 --> 05:36.503
We'll cross that bridge
when we get there... without you.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.296
[roars]

05:38.380 --> 05:39.881
[screams]

05:39.965 --> 05:41.049
[groans]

05:45.345 --> 05:50.100
-Wait! I've acquired the Fetch!
-The Fetch? More changelings?

05:50.183 --> 05:53.937
But we are nearly finished.
What good would it be to bring another--

05:54.020 --> 05:55.772
Be quiet, Impure.

05:56.856 --> 05:57.816
Go on.

05:57.899 --> 06:02.320
Think how proud your father will be
to see his legion grow.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.655
Prepare the exchange.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.701
In case we're ever one changeling short.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.748
"Dear Claire, you're receiving this letter

06:13.832 --> 06:18.128
because I've most likely
been slaughtered by a troll."

06:19.087 --> 06:20.130
[sighs]

06:21.506 --> 06:25.427
"Claire, I don't know
how to tell you this, but let me try."

06:25.510 --> 06:29.306
[Steve] "What lady is that, which doth
enrich the hand of yonder knight?

06:29.389 --> 06:32.684
She doth teach the torches to burn bright!

06:32.767 --> 06:38.106
It seems she hangs upon
the cheek of night like a rich jewel."

06:38.189 --> 06:40.400
[Jim]
"Beauty too rich for use.

06:40.483 --> 06:46.156
For earth too dear, so shows
a snowy dove trooping with crows.

06:46.239 --> 06:50.410
Did my heart love till now?
Forswear it, sight.

06:50.493 --> 06:54.414
For I never saw true beauty
till this night."

06:54.497 --> 06:58.376
"My bounty is as boundless
as the sea. My love as deep.

06:58.460 --> 07:03.006
The more I give to thee,
the more I have, for both are infinite."

07:03.089 --> 07:04.883
She's good, isn't she?

07:06.134 --> 07:09.846
-Yeah, she's great.
-[Claire] I hear... I hear some...

07:09.930 --> 07:14.059
-Goodbye, Claire.
-...something. Ah, fudgeknuckle!

07:14.142 --> 07:16.394
[woman]
Juliet, find your mark.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.395
[bell dings]

07:17.479 --> 07:18.897
[opens oven door]

07:18.980 --> 07:24.194
Blueberry waffles? Bacon mac and cheese?
Shrimp cakes? What is this, a last meal?

07:24.277 --> 07:27.280
Well, I wanted to bake cookies,
I decided to make your favorite,

07:27.364 --> 07:29.032
and then... eh, all your favorites.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.744
If you think this is going to get you
out of apologizing to Ms. Nomura--

07:32.827 --> 07:36.206
Hey, can't we just have dinner?
We've both been so busy.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.708
When's the last time
we've really sat down and talked?

07:39.501 --> 07:41.044
I'll set the table.

07:41.544 --> 07:45.924
Oh! That was delicious. I don't know
what I'd do without you, kiddo.

07:46.007 --> 07:49.177
-I'd be ten pounds lighter, but...
-Well, you deserve it.

07:49.260 --> 07:53.682
Shrimp cakes?
Gosh, I haven't had those since...

07:53.765 --> 07:55.809
-Since...
-Dad made them for us?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.979
[chuckles] I didn't think
you were old enough to remember.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.689
Oh, I remember enough.

08:00.772 --> 08:04.150
I remember how his beard would
scratch my face when he hugged me.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.361
How he used to make you laugh.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.739
But, most of all,
how much he hurt you when he left.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.450
Jim, where is this coming from?

08:12.534 --> 08:17.956
No matter what happens to me,
I would never leave you like that.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.710
At least, well...
[chuckles] not by choice.

08:21.793 --> 08:27.007
You're an amazing person, and I just
want you to know I'll always love you.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.426
Don't you start that talk with me.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.846
I'm still hoping you'll end up close
at an in-state college.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.806
Now, help me clear the dishes.

08:35.597 --> 08:38.018
We are going to wrap
these up for tomorrow.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.227
You have to give me that waffle recipe.

08:40.311 --> 08:43.023
If there's anything
I could eat forever, it's waffles.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.233
It's here when you need it.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.703
Whoa.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.829
[gasps]

08:59.164 --> 08:59.998
Huh.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.182
Whoa. What?

09:19.851 --> 09:24.856
"Weak points. Rule three:
Kick him in the gronk-nuks.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.650
Identifying your opponent's weakness."

09:27.734 --> 09:29.444
[Toby over walkie-talkie]
<i>Hey, Jimbo. You up?</i>

09:30.111 --> 09:31.654
Yeah. How can I sleep?

09:31.738 --> 09:33.865
-<i>What are you doing?</i>
-Reading.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.159
<i>Tomorrow's a pretty big day.</i>
<i>You ready?</i>

09:36.242 --> 09:39.829
-Mmm... nope.
-<i>Yeah, me neither. Night, Jimbo.</i>

09:39.913 --> 09:42.165
Good pep talk, Tobes.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.125
Huh.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.837
-[students speaking indistinctly]
-[school bell rings]

09:47.962 --> 09:52.092
[creatures speaking indistinctly]

09:52.175 --> 09:55.929
Then, Hector turned
to the masses of Troy and said...

09:56.012 --> 09:59.432
Gathered trollkind!

09:59.516 --> 10:04.646
The Trollhunter has laid a challenge
before the son of his predecessor,

10:04.729 --> 10:08.983
and you shall all bear witness
to the ensuing battle,

10:09.067 --> 10:11.861
which will be one for the ages...

10:11.945 --> 10:15.073
[quietly]
if not remarkably painful and short.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.329
Hey, I... I want you to have this.

10:21.412 --> 10:24.249
-What's this?
-It says everything I want to say.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.167
You promised me tacos.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.045
[scoffs]
Now is not the time for lunch, Tobes.

10:29.129 --> 10:33.341
Last week, we went for tacos.
I paid. You said, "Next time on me."

10:33.424 --> 10:36.427
You're going to get this letter back
unopened after the fight,

10:36.511 --> 10:38.763
and when you get back, we'll get tacos.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.598
[chuckles]
Tacos sounds good.

10:40.682 --> 10:44.602
Draal, son of Kanjigar, son of Tarigar,

10:44.686 --> 10:49.274
Draal "the Destroyer," come forth.

10:53.736 --> 10:57.365
-[roars, laughs]
-[crowd cheering]

10:58.658 --> 11:01.828
It's time to put everything
I've ever said to you to practice.

11:01.911 --> 11:05.039
With a little luck, he'll trip and fall.
Now, tell me: rule one.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.499
-Always be afraid.
-Rule two.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.251
-Always finish a fight.
-Rule three?

11:08.334 --> 11:09.836
About that. I was reading,

11:09.919 --> 11:12.714
when the Venerable Bedehilde
fought the Hydrabeast,

11:12.797 --> 11:16.718
there were no gronk-nuks,
but there was a weakness under its scales.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.262
-You read the book?
-So, it got me thinking.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.515
-Does Draal have a weakness?
-He read the book. He read the book!

11:22.599 --> 11:24.058
Books tasty.

11:24.142 --> 11:30.356
And now, Draal's combatant,
James Lake Jr.,

11:30.440 --> 11:31.774
son of...

11:31.858 --> 11:32.901
[whispering]

11:32.984 --> 11:34.402
"Ba-bu-rah."

11:34.485 --> 11:38.448
Come forth, human Trollhunter.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.116
[crowd booing]

11:40.992 --> 11:42.577
[takes deep breath]

11:43.953 --> 11:49.542
Fight from your heart, Master Jim.
It's strong, stronger than any rock.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.711
[quietly]
And certainly, stronger than mine.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.297
Prepare for battle.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.465
[roars]

12:00.970 --> 12:04.641
Here we go. I am doing this.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.852
-Begin!
-[crowd cheers]

12:18.488 --> 12:19.697
[growls]

12:24.327 --> 12:25.578
Whoa!

12:30.959 --> 12:32.210
[Draal yells]

12:35.880 --> 12:37.757
[screams]

12:39.008 --> 12:40.677
-[crowd cheers]
-[screams]

12:44.722 --> 12:46.182
[laughs]

12:50.478 --> 12:51.312
[grunts]

12:54.357 --> 12:56.150
-[crowd exclaims]
-[gasps]

12:59.529 --> 13:01.906
-I never taught him that. Did you?
-He's a natural!

13:02.657 --> 13:03.783
[Draal roars]

13:06.369 --> 13:08.037
And there goes that move.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.206
[roars]

13:11.165 --> 13:13.584
Ten whole seconds! He's not dead!
That's a fortuitous sign.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.753
-[Jim screaming]
-Don't jinx.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.182
[crowd cheers]

13:28.266 --> 13:29.809
-Jim!
-Look away!

13:29.892 --> 13:31.602
We will not remember him like this.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.981
[grunts, laughs]

13:40.028 --> 13:42.196
[roars]

13:47.368 --> 13:48.828
[screaming]

13:51.122 --> 13:53.249
-[roars]
-[crowd cheering]

13:58.588 --> 14:02.383
-[Draal laughs]
-[screams, grunts]

14:02.467 --> 14:05.178
He's getting killed! Do something!

14:05.261 --> 14:09.057
-Forget being a pacifist! Save Jim!
-He cannot. This is Jim's fight.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.725
[laughing]

14:12.685 --> 14:14.145
Rule number three.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.480
[screams]

14:15.563 --> 14:16.481
[all groan]

14:16.564 --> 14:18.483
[groans]
Huh?

14:19.734 --> 14:22.403
[grunts]
What? Huh?

14:22.487 --> 14:24.864
[growls, grunts]

14:24.947 --> 14:27.742
By Deya's grace, he found it!

14:27.867 --> 14:30.953
-Found what?
-His weakness! Draal's blind spot!

14:31.037 --> 14:33.831
[Draal yelling]

14:36.959 --> 14:39.712
You cannot be the Trollhunter!
You're a boy!

14:39.796 --> 14:45.176
-I am the son of Kanjigar!
-And I am Jim, son of Barbara.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.680
And the amulet chose me!

14:49.764 --> 14:50.723
[roars]

14:54.894 --> 14:57.438
[grunts, screams]

14:57.522 --> 14:59.565
[all gasp]

15:07.031 --> 15:08.074
Yes! He did it!

15:08.157 --> 15:11.035
It's not over yet.
He has to finish the fight.

15:11.119 --> 15:14.872
[crowd chanting]
Finish the fight! Finish the fight!

15:18.501 --> 15:19.544
[grunts]

15:24.340 --> 15:25.883
[grunts]

15:25.967 --> 15:28.344
[chanting continues]

15:33.057 --> 15:33.933
[yells]

15:36.310 --> 15:37.770
[exhales]

15:39.063 --> 15:42.233
The fight is to the death.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.694
House rules, not mine.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.906
Come on, man. Don't make it weird.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.244
[crowd booing]

15:56.956 --> 15:58.749
You should have killed me.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.797
Look, I may not have followed your rules,

16:04.881 --> 16:07.633
but neither did the amulet
when it chose me.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.552
[booing continues]

16:09.635 --> 16:15.183
Right now, over our heads,
changelings are in Arcadia.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.727
-[all gasp]
-What is he talking about?

16:17.810 --> 16:21.439
You'll need a Trollhunter
who doesn't have to live in the shadows.

16:21.522 --> 16:26.777
This is a time to work together.
They're building the Killahead--

16:26.861 --> 16:29.113
Stop! Say no more!
We must leave this instant!

16:29.197 --> 16:31.532
-[crowd booing]
-They have a right to know.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.494
And you have a right to listen!
Ours is an ancient race.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.913
It will take time to win hearts and minds.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.125
[Jim]
Why are they treating him that way?

16:41.209 --> 16:43.961
You spared his life,
but destroyed his honor.

16:44.045 --> 16:47.632
He will never be able to show his face
in Trollmarket again.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.511
Hmm...

16:52.428 --> 16:53.387
Oh, praise!

16:53.471 --> 16:55.640
[laughs]
You're alive!

16:55.723 --> 16:59.435
-[chuckles] And sore. Ease up.
-Just one more minute.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.313
Aaarrrgghh, Blinky... a word.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.523
Good fight.

17:04.607 --> 17:09.444
Yes! Very good fight, Master Jim.
I'll handle Vendel. You get home and rest.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.907
Tomorrow, we shall join you for these...
What do you call them? Ah, yes, "tacos."

17:13.991 --> 17:16.827
-[Aaarrrgghh] Mmm, tacos.
-You opened the letter.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.913
When I read I was your best friend,

17:18.996 --> 17:21.707
it took our relationship
to just a whole new level.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.625
[sighs]

17:24.126 --> 17:25.627
[crickets chirping]

17:25.711 --> 17:29.257
Just an average teenager
after an average teenage day.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.633
Hey, Mom, I'm home.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.594
I'm just going to head upstairs
to get a jump on homework.

17:33.678 --> 17:38.182
-In here. Guess who brought tea?
-Oh, not Strickler again.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.185
[gasps]

17:41.269 --> 17:44.188
Don't you have something to say
to Ms. Nomura?

17:47.525 --> 17:52.363
I'm sorry, Ms. Nomura. I should have never
gone into the museum in the first place.

17:52.446 --> 17:56.826
It's an unforgivable offense
and I deeply apologize.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.369
That's more like it.

17:58.452 --> 18:04.667
But not as sorry as you're going to be
for coming into my home, with my mother.

18:04.750 --> 18:08.921
So, you'd better leave now,
or else we'll both be sorry.

18:09.005 --> 18:13.968
Jim! She's our guest.
What's gotten into you?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.303
-Mom!
-[clicks tongue]

18:16.345 --> 18:19.015
That speech was very moving.

18:19.640 --> 18:23.352
Too bad she won't remember it
when she wakes up and finds your body!

18:23.436 --> 18:24.604
[amulet dings]

18:25.980 --> 18:29.567
-[Nomura grunts]
-[screams]

18:31.360 --> 18:32.862
Looking for these?

18:34.280 --> 18:35.948
[Nomura yells]

18:39.285 --> 18:40.411
[grunts]

18:41.329 --> 18:42.163
[hisses]

18:43.831 --> 18:45.249
[yells, laughs]

18:58.721 --> 19:00.097
[yells]

19:05.061 --> 19:10.691
[whistling haunting melody]

19:17.073 --> 19:19.283
Yes! Thank you!

19:19.367 --> 19:21.911
[whistling continues]

19:27.375 --> 19:33.673
[Nomura] You can't hide forever.
Trust me... I would know.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.559
[fighting, grunting]

19:46.394 --> 19:48.062
[fighting continues]

19:51.524 --> 19:53.025
[Nomura yells]

19:53.150 --> 19:54.360
[gasps]

20:06.831 --> 20:11.460
-What are you doing here?
-Delivering you pain again, Nomura.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.046
Do not touch the Trollhunter.

20:14.130 --> 20:18.634
Suddenly you're honorable?
Sorry to hear about daddy.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.804
Bular always liked the way he screamed.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.013
[yells]

20:26.350 --> 20:28.853
[grunts]

20:30.312 --> 20:32.857
-[yells]
-[screams]

20:33.858 --> 20:35.943
[grunting]

20:38.487 --> 20:39.989
[roars]

20:42.074 --> 20:43.617
[screaming]

20:44.535 --> 20:45.661
Impure.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.748
You were right.

20:48.831 --> 20:52.835
-So, you're not here to kill me?
-Not kill. Protect.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.131
[woman]
Be quiet or I'm calling the police!

21:00.050 --> 21:02.928
Take it. Don't make it weird.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.602
You going to be okay?

21:09.685 --> 21:10.811
I am.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.396
[sniffs]

21:12.480 --> 21:17.026
But, are you? Your battles won't
always be waged in arenas.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.111
You won't have time to prepare,

21:19.195 --> 21:23.365
to study your opponent
for weaknesses as you did me.

21:23.449 --> 21:29.079
You are the Trollhunter.
It is time to start being afraid.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.498
[sighs]

21:30.581 --> 21:35.044
Since I cannot go back to Trollmarket,
I will guard your home.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.422
I... I don't think my mother
would be down with that.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.382
[snoring]

21:44.512 --> 21:50.726
This is nice. Here I shall protect you
and your fleshbag mother, Bar-bu-rah.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.186
Mmm... close enough.

21:52.269 --> 21:56.482
Your mother will awaken soon.
I protect. I do not clean.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.902
Right. Yep. I'll get right on that.

22:00.194 --> 22:01.362
Fleshbag...

22:01.445 --> 22:02.947
[snorts]

22:03.030 --> 22:06.408
Maybe you'll make
a good Trollhunter, after all.

22:06.492 --> 22:11.956
When that time comes,
I will be proud to fight by your side.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.125
Thanks, Draal.
