Tomorrow morning, the sun rises
at 6:17 a.m., at which time

00:09.777 --> 00:11.510
we will leave the house
so we are first in line

00:11.512 --> 00:13.479
for the most important day
of our lives.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.813
Maya, they're just tacos.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.783
What?

00:19.353 --> 00:21.453
Is it necessary
that we are first in line?

00:21.455 --> 00:23.288
I would regard
not being first in line

00:23.290 --> 00:24.656
as my greatest personal failure

00:24.658 --> 00:26.892
since not
understanding fractions.

00:26.894 --> 00:29.328
They're just parts
of a number.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.464
Well, parts? When would I ever
need numbered parts?

00:32.466 --> 00:34.233
How many tacos
are you having?

00:34.235 --> 00:37.002
Eight isn't enough,
but nine is too many.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.338
There's no solution.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.205
Yeah.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.307
Okay, we took our showers

00:42.309 --> 00:43.342
and put on our clothes
for tomorrow,

00:43.344 --> 00:45.677
so we're all ready to go
when the sun comes up.

excited too.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.382
I love you, Barry.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.051
Okay, we are
all set to go,

00:52.053 --> 00:53.252
so nothing can go wrong.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.354
Will there be any stops
in Rileytown?

00:55.356 --> 00:56.555
Sir, no, sir!

00:56.557 --> 00:57.890

00:57.892 --> 00:59.491

-Eight-and-a-half.

-(door slams shut)
-Okay, tell me the rules. One.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.345
I will not fall
and break something

01:20.347 --> 01:22.047
and have to go
to the hospital.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.716
-Two.
-I will spend as little time
in the hospital as possible.

01:24.718 --> 01:25.951
Three.

01:25.953 --> 01:28.454
I will not check my phone
or read a story about

01:28.456 --> 01:31.023
a three-legged puppy
and become inconsolable.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.022

Riley, why can't you
just look for Barry-the-Bear
when you get back?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.593
Oh, sure. He's just missing.

-I'm sure I'm not okay.

was, "I wish you were a Slinky."

04:31.272 --> 04:32.304
Riley, he'll show up.

04:32.306 --> 04:33.639
It's not really a big deal.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.008
Attaboy. Let's see
what happens now.

04:37.378 --> 04:41.647
"Not a big deal"?

04:41.649 --> 04:43.782
I messed up.
I messed up.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.256

05:02.136 --> 05:04.469

there would be tacos.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.606
Three tacos please.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.741
Uh, may I have pancakes?

05:11.278 --> 05:13.512
-You called them here?
-I invited them here.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.682
I wanted them to know
what it's like to want a taco

05:16.684 --> 05:18.850
and not get a taco.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.120

pay attention to you

when we can
pay attention to him?

06:17.244 --> 06:19.745
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.346
I was just a little kid.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.081
I ate anything
that got in my way.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.550
Auggie, it wasn't very nice
to eat Riley's bear.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.586
And in fact,
you would think in doing that,

06:27.588 --> 06:30.055
-that would teach Riley
not to eat someone's cookie.
-Mm.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.691
Get off that.

06:32.693 --> 06:33.959
I do not wish to.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.363
That bear's been
nothing but trouble
for me my whole life.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.198
I just wanted
you to play with me.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.266
I didn't do this.

06:41.268 --> 06:42.567
Oh, yeah?

06:42.569 --> 06:44.770
Then where were you
the evening of the 15th?

06:44.772 --> 06:46.671
I was out of town
on business.

06:46.673 --> 06:49.107
He didn't do it, guys.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.943
You know what?
If this means this much
to my daughter,

06:51.945 --> 06:53.612
let's respect her feelings.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.848
Let's find that stupid,
faceless bear.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.750
Y-- you know,
I-- I would,

06:58.752 --> 07:03.722
but I-- I got that big game
with, uh, s-- s-- sports. Yeah.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.224
Yeah, yeah,
and I would too,

07:06.226 --> 07:08.260
but I got the, you know,
the big-- big science fair

07:08.262 --> 07:10.529
with, uh...

07:10.531 --> 07:12.697
I don't know.

07:12.699 --> 07:15.634
Why did you two
switch characters?

07:15.636 --> 07:18.437
-We panicked!
-We're gonna be trapped in here
looking for a stuffed animal!

07:18.439 --> 07:19.871
We'll do anything
to get out of it.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.607
I know.
Who's up for a taco?

07:25.813 --> 07:28.013
You lost!
Now get off of me.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.650
Well, I'll stick around here
as long as it takes

07:31.652 --> 07:33.151
because I am
a supportive friend.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.921
Hey, Riley, what about
just this once,

07:35.923 --> 07:38.723
I can be
the unsupportive friend?

07:38.725 --> 07:40.225
Absolutely.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.793
-Live your lives.
-(door opens)

07:41.795 --> 07:44.629
Oh, but before you go,

07:44.631 --> 07:46.431
one quick story.

07:46.433 --> 07:50.168
Hey, a story.

07:51.638 --> 07:55.507
Once upon a time,
there was a little, tiny Riley,

07:55.509 --> 07:57.976
and she was given a bear.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.245
Sweetie, I know
you don't feel good,

08:00.247 --> 08:01.913
but Mom and Dad
have to go to work.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.282
-Please don't go.
-(Cory chuckles)

08:04.284 --> 08:06.084
Mrs. Svorski's
in the other room,

08:06.086 --> 08:08.954
and we have someone else
to keep you company too.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.789
Look. It's a teddy bear.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.591
But I want you.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.292
We know, honey.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.594
But when you look
at this bear,

08:15.596 --> 08:17.529
it's like we're looking
right back at you.

08:17.531 --> 08:18.930
So, it's like
we're with you all day.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.265
And when you hug Barry,

08:20.267 --> 08:22.501
it's just like
you're hugging us.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.436
-No.
-Oh.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.776
Bye.

08:31.778 --> 08:32.677
(door opens)

08:34.948 --> 08:36.615
Bye, honey.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.815
(squeaks)

09:11.885 --> 09:14.419
And the little girl
loved the little bear

09:14.421 --> 09:16.922
for the rest
of her little life.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.057
Whoa! Great story!

09:19.059 --> 09:21.593
That was so good.
Guys, let's go.

to do this for Riley

10:24.558 --> 10:27.225

for biting his face off.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.663
What's this?

10:32.933 --> 10:34.833
Ooh, what are
these silver mittens?

These are my dad's

10:49.116 --> 10:50.515
Again?

10:50.517 --> 10:52.851
Well, he won them
in the Navy.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.755
He gave them to me, and...

10:56.757 --> 10:58.189
the first thing I did
was lose 'em.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.125
Shouldn't they be
important to you?

11:00.127 --> 11:01.660
They were.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.795
But you know what?
Kids lose stuff.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.764
But he wanted
me to have something

11:05.766 --> 11:07.265
that meant so much to him.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.833
That's what was important.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.303
Not the thing itself,
but that he gave them to me.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.040
Time to pass them on
to your son now?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.042
Believe me, Auggie,

11:17.044 --> 11:19.577
you do not want
this kind of responsibility.

11:20.981 --> 11:24.949
True. The crushing weight
of the bear has already
messed me up for life.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.518
(chuckles)

11:26.520 --> 11:27.786
Good.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.088
Come here.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.501
Hey.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.869
Hey.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.838
Do you remember
when I first got here

11:46.840 --> 11:49.340
and everybody was
washing the car?

11:49.342 --> 11:51.409
You sat next to me
on that bucket,

11:51.411 --> 11:53.812
you talked to me,
I talked back to you?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.246
Yeah.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.482
Yeah.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.551
Do you remember
how you were very nice to me

11:59.553 --> 12:02.320
but you didn't really know me,
but you sat next to me

12:02.322 --> 12:03.555
and talked to me anyway?

12:04.725 --> 12:08.059
Yeah. Did-- did I say
anything important?

12:08.061 --> 12:09.094
Didn't matter what you said.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.829
It was that you sat there
next to me.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.732
That time where I was
feeling like an outsider,

12:13.734 --> 12:15.667
I remember that.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.903
I appreciated that.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.975
Okay.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.088
Can I ask you a question?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.524
Sure.
(chuckles) Oh, yeah.

12:41.027 --> 12:42.527
I heard you used to
be quite the wacko.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.395
Oh. I had my moments.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.031
I heard you were
a hippie-dippie child
of the universe.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.234
I like to think
I was my own person.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.035
How come you're not
like that anymore?

12:51.037 --> 12:54.405
Well, she's definitely
still a part of me,

12:54.407 --> 12:57.408
but I just think
that as we grow,

12:57.410 --> 12:58.910
whoever it is
we used to be

12:58.912 --> 13:02.080
just become a part
of our... scrapbook.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.482
How can you be sure
you're growing in the right way?

13:04.484 --> 13:09.387
Well, I don't know,
Mr. Turtleneck, Mop-Top,
Farkle Time, Donnie Barnes.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.422
Do you miss
any of those people?

13:11.424 --> 13:12.991
They all got me
to where I am now. I...

13:12.993 --> 13:15.126
I guess they're part
of my scrapbook too.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.096
Like Riley's teddy bear.
That's why we're looking
for it so hard?

13:18.098 --> 13:20.064
I don't know, Farkle.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.668
Why are we all looking so hard
for the last ripped up,

13:23.670 --> 13:26.838
raggedy piece
of Riley's childhood?

13:26.840 --> 13:30.308
Maybe I'm not quite ready
for it to be gone.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.932
Lucas?

13:55.001 --> 13:57.101
Do you have anything
from when you were a kid

13:57.103 --> 13:58.369
that you still hold on to?

13:59.306 --> 14:01.840
One thing.
It's kind of dumb though.

14:01.842 --> 14:02.874
What is it?

14:02.876 --> 14:05.944
When I was like four years old,

14:05.946 --> 14:08.980
my Pappy Joe gave me something
called a sack of gold.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.782
It was a little canvas bag

14:10.784 --> 14:13.017
and it had drawstrings
to open it.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.552
Lucas, are we rich?

14:14.554 --> 14:16.187
(chuckles)

14:16.189 --> 14:17.722
-I thought so.
-(chuckles)

14:17.724 --> 14:19.657
I kept it for years.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.492
Then one day,
I saw that Zay had

14:21.494 --> 14:23.027
his own little sack
of gold too.

14:23.029 --> 14:26.397
And I said, "Hey, Zay,
you got a sack of gold?"

14:26.399 --> 14:28.399
And he said, "Yeah."

14:29.903 --> 14:32.837
And he opened it up,
poured the whole thing
in his mouth,

14:32.839 --> 14:35.473
chewed it,
and blew a bubble.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.041
It was bubblegum?

14:37.043 --> 14:38.343
Yes. His was.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.544
Yours was real gold?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.913
Yes. I believed it was.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.882
And I still believe it is.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.416
'Cause I am never
gonna open it up

14:45.418 --> 14:47.085
to find out any different.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.222
It's funny about
these things we hold on to.

14:51.224 --> 14:55.059
And how life lets us know
when it's time to let it go.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.694
Yeah.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.264
Sometimes it's just
a little bag of bubblegum.

14:59.266 --> 15:03.268
But if the right person
gives it to you, then it's gold.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.941
Life, we need to talk.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.076
Here I am
on taco day,

15:12.078 --> 15:14.112
no taco whatsoever.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.713
Would you care
to explain yourself

15:15.715 --> 15:17.148
in your mysterious ways?

15:18.518 --> 15:20.551
Hey, family!
Don't try to pressure me
into staying for dinner.

15:20.553 --> 15:21.953
I'm just here
to do my laundry.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.221
That's right.
That's a thing now.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.089
I do my laundry here.
Did you know?

15:25.091 --> 15:27.292
'Cause now you know.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.060
-My brother!
-My laundry!

15:29.062 --> 15:30.762
His laundry!

15:32.065 --> 15:33.298
(screams)

15:34.634 --> 15:36.601
I'm sorry.
I lost my mind.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.238
I will just take these
to the creek

15:40.240 --> 15:42.273
and I will wash them myself.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.110
What's everybody doing?
Who's here?

15:46.112 --> 15:48.146
Maya:
Who do you most want
to be here?

15:52.585 --> 15:53.618
Maya.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.453
Josh.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.721
Long game?

15:56.723 --> 15:58.723
Long game.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.894
We're looking
for Riley's lost teddy.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.462
Barry-the-Bear Bear?

16:04.464 --> 16:05.663
She's had that thing forever.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.998
You lost it?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.499
Yeah, but I think I'm ready

16:08.501 --> 16:11.336
to call Barry officially lost
and head out for tacos.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.271
No. Really? No.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.405
No, no giving up.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.341
Yes, give up. Yes.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.143
No, it's important we find it.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.578
-Why?
-(footsteps)

16:20.580 --> 16:21.813
Uncle Josh!

16:21.815 --> 16:23.214
Mr. Auggie.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.484
-How's college?
-Oh, dude, you kidding?

16:26.486 --> 16:27.685
Dude, you kidding?

16:27.687 --> 16:29.354
Dude, the people,
the parties,

16:29.356 --> 16:30.655
you kidding, dude?

16:31.858 --> 16:33.157
You want to stay here tonight?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.759
Just a night?
How about forever?

16:35.862 --> 16:37.161
Has it been
a rough adjustment?

16:37.163 --> 16:39.163
It was a rough adjustment
for us in high school.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.766
-What about college?
-You think you're ready.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.267
You think you're ready.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.302
What's the matter, honey?

16:44.304 --> 16:45.536
I wasn't ready!

16:45.538 --> 16:47.205
It's hard.
I wasn't ready.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.273
My roommate and I,
we don't get along at all,

16:49.275 --> 16:51.376
And I don't think it's my fault.
I think it's his fault.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.544
He says "schnoop-aloop"
at the end of everything.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.313
Who does that?
Now ask me a question.

16:55.315 --> 16:58.282
-What time is it?
-11:15. Schnoop-aloop.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.018
-Ask me who I am.
-Who are you?

17:00.020 --> 17:01.352
I'm Schnoop-aloop's roommate.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.620
You know what people say
when they see me?

17:02.622 --> 17:04.555
They say, "Hey, that's
Schnoop-aloop's roommate."

17:04.557 --> 17:07.025
My name is Josh.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.327
How did this happen to me?
I'll tell you how it happened.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.396
I grew up.
You know what I know?

17:11.398 --> 17:13.865
High school is you last stop
before you grow up.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.233
So, you don't give up
on that teddy bear.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.268
You hang on tight.
You find that bear.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.338
You understand
what's important, Riley?

17:20.340 --> 17:22.740
Yeah, I think I do.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.042
Lucas?

17:24.044 --> 17:25.276
After you.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.717
(calliope music playing)

17:55.041 --> 17:57.241
(festive Mexican horns play)

17:58.511 --> 18:02.080
Atención!<i> Tacopalooza</i>
<i>is officially over!</i>

18:02.082 --> 18:04.449
<i>Somebody just came</i>
<i>and cleaned us out good!</i>

18:04.451 --> 18:06.684
<i>We'll do it again</i>
<i>in 25 years.</i>

18:08.388 --> 18:10.054
We looked everywhere.
We can't find it.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.289
I didn't think you would.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.557
Why not?

18:12.559 --> 18:14.792
Because I have
a really strong feeling

18:14.794 --> 18:16.094
that it's supposed to be gone.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.195
Where?

18:17.197 --> 18:19.030
Wherever these things go.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.299
How are we gonna tell Riley?

18:21.301 --> 18:22.467
Hey, where is Riley?

18:22.469 --> 18:23.868
She and Lucas
were looking together.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.036
Riley!

18:26.439 --> 18:27.939
-Yes?
-Where have you guys been?

18:27.941 --> 18:29.474
We haven't seen you
in a half an hour.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.775
-An hour.
-A half an hour.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.143
I don't get it!

18:33.246 --> 18:35.046
Riley found
what we needed to find.

18:35.048 --> 18:36.647
Yeah. Lucas and I found out

18:36.649 --> 18:38.316
that we were looking
in the wrong place,

18:38.318 --> 18:40.151
so then we looked
in the right place.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.986
-You found the bear?
-No.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.454
You find the bear?

18:43.456 --> 18:45.623
No. Sorry.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.893
Remember when
Auggie wanted to give up
Mr. Googly and grow up?

18:48.895 --> 18:50.228
But then I didn't.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.429
I wasn't ready.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.464
Yeah. Good for you.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.501
But at some point,
I think we are ready.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.737
How do we know
when that is, Maya?

18:59.739 --> 19:02.907
I think something
inside us tells us.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.176
I think it actually comes
to tell us.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.515
Riles...

19:10.517 --> 19:13.351
I don't want
to let you down, but I...

19:13.353 --> 19:15.486
think your bear is gone.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.056
Yeah. I don't want to let
you down either.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.794
So, we got you this!

19:23.796 --> 19:27.532
(vocalizes festive
Mexican horns)

19:27.534 --> 19:29.433
Cory and Maya:
Tacos!

19:32.772 --> 19:34.438
Riles!

19:34.440 --> 19:36.974
Sorry I didn't realize sooner
what was important, Maya.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.543
So, I cried real hard.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.678
You didn't have to cry.
It's not that important.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.647
Yeah, I did or else
he wouldn't have given me one.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.215
What?

19:44.217 --> 19:45.383
Bobblehead!

19:45.385 --> 19:50.488
Oh! Bobby, I will hold you tight
and never let you go.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.224
Yes, you will,
and that'll be okay.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.358
Thanks, Riles.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.128
This is what's important.

20:10.143 --> 20:12.243
Really? Are you sure?

20:12.245 --> 20:13.644
Yeah, I'm sure.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.347
I'm completely sure
what's gonna happen,

20:16.349 --> 20:18.649
but I'm gonna give 'em
to you anyway.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.552
I'll take care of this
forever, Dad.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.754
I know you'll try.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.991
So, Riley, we're not gonna
keep looking for the bear?

20:28.428 --> 20:30.061
He knew it was time to go.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.530
He knew that
you didn't need him anymore.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.765
So, he waited
till you were asleep

20:34.767 --> 20:36.801
and kissed
your eyelashes goodbye.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.272
Grabbed his tiny travel hat
and his little suitcase

20:41.274 --> 20:43.358
and he thanked you
for your years together.

20:43.359 --> 20:45.443
And he told me to tell you
he forgave you for eating
one of his cookies.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.578
Then he hopped
out the bay window

20:47.580 --> 20:49.347
and got on the G train
to Beartown.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.949
I think that's
exactly what happened.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.451
Thank you, everybody.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.119
That's what we're here for.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.889
-Hey, Auggie?
-Yeah?

20:58.891 --> 21:00.891
It's a great story
that you chewed his face off

21:00.893 --> 21:02.760
because you wanted to
hang out with me and Maya.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.328
Never lose that, okay?

21:04.330 --> 21:05.596
Okay.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.832
-Can we hang out?
-No. Get out of here.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.535
You know what?
I think it's time
I got out of here.

21:11.537 --> 21:13.571
What happened to forever?

21:13.573 --> 21:15.273
I'll get your laundry.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.241
Josh, you can stay here
as long as you'd like.

21:17.243 --> 21:18.576
Yeah, you can.

21:18.578 --> 21:19.777
I know.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.380
Thank you, but looking
at you guys, I just get

21:22.382 --> 21:24.982
this feeling that
there's some good friends
to be made back at my dorm.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.884
With Schnoop-aloop?

21:28.588 --> 21:31.055
Maybe Josh just needs
to get to know him better.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.791
Maybe I just need
to let them get to
know me a little bit better.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.927
Yeah. You know,
you're not a bad guy at all.

21:36.929 --> 21:37.628
Oh, yeah?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.600
Thank you, Zay.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.669
Zay:
You're welcome.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.772
And I'm glad that you
and Maya decided that you might
be right for each other someday

21:47.774 --> 21:49.807
and you'll fly
to the moon and all that.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.475
Josh:
Oh, yeah?

21:51.477 --> 21:53.010
Yeah. Very sophisticated.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.579
Now here's what I was thinking
back here on Earth.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.481
Hey, Maya, uh...

21:57.483 --> 21:59.950
Lucas and Riley are gonna
be going out on dates

21:59.952 --> 22:02.887
and holding hands
and all scared to death...

22:04.590 --> 22:06.757
and Lucas isn't gonna
think anything at all

22:06.759 --> 22:08.659
about ditching
one of his best friends--

22:08.661 --> 22:12.363
-I'm not ditching--
-You abandoned me for her.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.532
-Okay.
-(chuckles)

22:14.534 --> 22:17.335
And if you really care
about her like you say,

22:17.337 --> 22:21.706
then you don't want to see her
thinking so much about later
that she misses now. Do you?

22:21.708 --> 22:23.541
No.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.909
What do you have in mind?

22:27.513 --> 22:29.480
Yeah, what do you
have in mind?

22:29.482 --> 22:31.982
You helped me not feel
like an outsider.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.185
There's a lot that's probably
gonna happen to us,

22:34.187 --> 22:36.120
and I'll probably be stupid.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.888
But...

22:37.890 --> 22:40.024
what's not stupid
is you and her.

22:41.194 --> 22:43.227
And I never want you to feel
like a third wheel when...

22:43.229 --> 22:44.962
Lucas and Riley are gazing

22:44.964 --> 22:48.065
into each other's
stupid, stupid eyes.

22:50.336 --> 22:53.637
So, I want you to know that
I'd be happy to sit next to you,

22:53.639 --> 22:56.307
next to Riley and Lucas,
at the movies,

22:56.309 --> 22:58.442
so we could all be together.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.579
That all right with you?
I don't care.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.180
Is that all right with you?

23:03.182 --> 23:05.583
Well, I think
that's up to Maya.

23:06.719 --> 23:07.952
Till next time?

23:09.021 --> 23:10.554
Till next time.

23:16.763 --> 23:17.995
-You want to go
to the movies?
-No.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.764
-Yes.
-Uck!

23:21.000 --> 23:22.266
Want to go to the movies?

23:22.268 --> 23:24.668
I just like
sitting next to you.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.370
Yeah.

23:26.372 --> 23:27.671
Yeah, okay.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.673
Thank you for asking.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.244
You want to go to the movies?

23:34.447 --> 23:35.746
What?

23:39.786 --> 23:41.419
(end music plays)
