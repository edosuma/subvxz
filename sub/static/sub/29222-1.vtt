02:42.677 --> 02:44.844
It's too quiet.

02:44.846 --> 02:46.612
There are six patrols out.

02:46.614 --> 02:47.948
Not a peek.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.949
I don't get it.

02:49.951 --> 02:51.418
- I don't like it.
- Yeah.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.353
It doesn't make any sense.

03:03.866 --> 03:06.800
I gotta go make a phone call.

03:12.874 --> 03:14.741
<i>Hey, gorgeous.</i>

Are you serious?

03:30.525 --> 03:33.460
- Six weeks.
- Yes?

03:33.462 --> 03:34.828
Six weeks.

03:34.830 --> 03:36.396
- We're having a baby!
- Ha-ha-ha.

03:36.398 --> 03:37.798
I take it you're happy.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.598
Baby, happy
doesn't even come close

03:39.600 --> 03:41.501

03:41.503 --> 03:43.069
I miss you so much.

05:03.951 --> 05:05.886
It's his brother.
Guy's a captain in the marines.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.120
You need to get out of here.
Please, Jake.

05:07.122 --> 05:08.954
<i>Dr. Singer?</i>

05:11.126 --> 05:13.026
<i>Get the cart. Defib to 300.</i>

<i>Is there a
reading on the oxygen?</i>

05:38.586 --> 05:42.189
Dr. Singer? Everything okay?

05:42.191 --> 05:44.089
Thought we lost you there
for a minute.

05:46.994 --> 05:49.499
Just, uh, keeping you
on your toes.

05:55.871 --> 06:00.507
Somebody has been sitting
in my chair.

06:00.509 --> 06:05.478
Somebody has been lying
in my bed.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.247
You see the way
he just craves knowledge,

06:07.249 --> 06:10.483
like, he, he's-he's so well read
and he's just, he...

06:10.485 --> 06:12.853
Obviously, he got that from me,
you know?

06:12.855 --> 06:15.187
Yeah, let's hope he gets
my sense of humor.

06:15.189 --> 06:17.156
Yeah, well... Yeah.
Oh, look at that.

06:17.158 --> 06:18.624
- Look at that.
- Look at that.

06:18.626 --> 06:19.759
You laughing.

06:19.761 --> 06:21.827
Look at this,
eatin' the book and...

06:21.829 --> 06:23.665
W-we miss daddy.

06:24.566 --> 06:26.702
Do we miss daddy?

06:29.804 --> 06:30.971
<i>Aw...</i>

06:32.139 --> 06:33.807
Mmm.

06:33.809 --> 06:35.841

06:35.843 --> 06:39.778
Just... work stuff, but...

06:39.780 --> 06:40.947
much better now.

06:43.285 --> 06:44.884
Right?

06:44.886 --> 06:46.552
<i>Ab-ab-ab.</i>

06:46.554 --> 06:48.187
I'm gonna put him down.

06:48.189 --> 06:49.990
Okay.

06:54.228 --> 06:55.964
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.865
Babe.

06:59.867 --> 07:01.703
<i>They are lucky to have you.</i>

07:02.670 --> 07:04.005
And so are we.

07:14.883 --> 07:15.918
Hey.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.139
<i>Honey.</i>

08:17.980 --> 08:19.678
Hey.

08:22.283 --> 08:24.317
You okay?

08:26.088 --> 08:28.691
Well, I think you're having
some rough dreams.

08:29.992 --> 08:31.259
I'm okay.

08:33.361 --> 08:36.363
Okay, well, hurry up.
He-he-he.

08:36.365 --> 08:38.568
I got that client meeting
this morning.

08:41.068 --> 08:42.869
Thank you.

08:44.740 --> 08:47.773
Yeah. Okey-do... Okay, okay.

08:47.775 --> 08:49.274
Okey-dokey.

08:49.276 --> 08:50.946
Okey-dokey.

09:23.277 --> 09:27.113
Uh, I'm-I'm not doing so great.
I'm-I'm still... You know...

09:27.115 --> 09:29.751
Murph, look at me. Hey.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.153
You're okay.

09:34.155 --> 09:35.355
<i>Like, come see me later</i>

09:35.357 --> 09:38.191
and we'll try and figure
something out.

09:38.193 --> 09:40.460
Okay, man. Alright, buddy.

09:42.863 --> 09:44.699
You. Mmm.

09:46.233 --> 09:50.003
Ah, sorry, man. Wa... Shit.

09:50.005 --> 09:52.105
We're overextended here.
You know how it is.

09:52.107 --> 09:54.307
You go to war with the army
you have, right?

09:54.309 --> 09:57.009
Yeah, except in this case,
the war is everywhere

09:57.011 --> 09:59.245
and we're almost out of ammo.

10:00.815 --> 10:04.017
We're holding this place
together with duct tape.

10:04.019 --> 10:05.421
<i>Bingo! Alright.</i>

10:08.189 --> 10:09.355
You good?

10:11.892 --> 10:13.362
I'm sleepin' like a baby.

10:14.896 --> 10:16.232
Then I am too.

10:18.266 --> 10:20.466
Oh, listen, if you, uh...

10:20.468 --> 10:23.870
You find any more
"Wounded Warriors,"

10:23.872 --> 10:25.138
you know,
psychologically speaking

10:25.140 --> 10:26.806
you know, people that need help,

10:26.808 --> 10:29.341
then I might have some more ammo
for the fight.

10:29.343 --> 10:32.144
As a trauma surgeon
I have no official opinion,

10:32.146 --> 10:34.980
but I will pass
that message along.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.883
Well, as your pharmacist,

10:36.885 --> 10:38.784
I have no clue
what you're talking about.

10:39.820 --> 10:40.919
But thank you.

10:40.921 --> 10:42.355
Take care of yourself.

10:42.357 --> 10:44.059
You keep up the good work.

11:02.343 --> 11:05.010
- Nurse!
- Get a doctor in here now!

11:07.482 --> 11:09.349
<i>Relax, hold on, hold on.</i>

11:10.785 --> 11:13.153
I-I-I need some help!

11:13.155 --> 11:16.089
Come on, come on.
Alright, relax, relax.

11:16.091 --> 11:17.856
Give me two milligrams of Ativan
right now. Go.

11:17.858 --> 11:20.360
I need you to back up.
Clear this area. Now!

11:20.362 --> 11:22.162
Take it off.

11:22.164 --> 11:23.962
Easy, easy.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.432
Good, good. Let's get a gurney.
Let's get ready. Go.

11:27.434 --> 11:29.405
- I got it.
- Let's get him up.

11:30.939 --> 11:33.373
Good? Let's go.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.274
<i>Okay, hold it.</i>

11:40.448 --> 11:41.983
Jacob...

12:05.339 --> 12:06.841
Jacob Singer.

12:09.511 --> 12:13.078
- Do I know you?
- Paul Rutiger.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.048
I was an operator
in your brother's team.

12:15.050 --> 12:17.149
<i>We did all three tours
together.</i>

12:17.151 --> 12:18.420
No shit.

12:20.255 --> 12:21.921
Well, nice to meet you.

12:21.923 --> 12:23.125
Yeah.

12:25.492 --> 12:28.227
Is... Is there something
you wanna talk to me about?

12:31.131 --> 12:32.498
About my brother?

12:32.500 --> 12:34.333
He's here in Atlanta.

12:34.335 --> 12:36.269
- Excuse me?
- Isaac is...

12:41.008 --> 12:43.142
P-people listening.

12:43.144 --> 12:44.943
<i>I have to be careful.</i>

12:44.945 --> 12:46.348
Look, whatever it is...

12:48.482 --> 12:50.352
Hey! Hey!

13:10.338 --> 13:11.904
Who was this guy?

13:11.906 --> 13:13.972
I don't know,
he just seemed kinda lost.

13:13.974 --> 13:15.975
He's probably out of his mind.

13:15.977 --> 13:18.076
Isaac's been dead
for over a year.

13:18.078 --> 13:21.280
You think this guy
was on anything?

13:21.282 --> 13:24.450
I think all these guys
are taking something.

13:24.452 --> 13:27.056
How else do you escape
these fucking nightmares?

13:28.223 --> 13:30.255
Alright.

13:30.257 --> 13:32.624
Well, let me know
if you see him again.

13:32.626 --> 13:34.530
I'd be interested
to talk to him.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.630
How about you?

13:38.632 --> 13:40.935
- How are you doing?
- Good.

13:42.636 --> 13:44.403
Good.

13:44.405 --> 13:46.605
No episodes?

13:46.607 --> 13:50.109
No. Not for years.
He's just, he...

13:50.111 --> 13:52.481
Listen, he's got me thinking
about Isaac and...

13:54.949 --> 13:58.283
<i>We know you've
had issues with your brother...</i>

13:58.285 --> 14:00.086
<i>Not issues.</i>

14:02.056 --> 14:03.655
Hey...

14:03.657 --> 14:05.960
<i>It's Just that
our relationship was...</i>

14:09.264 --> 14:10.466
<i>complicated.</i>

14:28.583 --> 14:32.118
What would you say to Isaac
if he were here... right now?

14:34.488 --> 14:36.090
I would tell him that I'm...

14:38.293 --> 14:39.628
that I'm sorry.

14:48.770 --> 14:51.540
Hey, hey, hey, Jake. Jake.

14:53.107 --> 14:54.639
We were just talking about you.

14:54.641 --> 14:56.609
You, you-you wanna come out
with us?

14:56.611 --> 15:00.113
- Yeah. Come out with us.
- Yeah.

15:00.115 --> 15:02.048
Uh, some other time. Yeah.

15:02.050 --> 15:05.518
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
hold up, hold on.

15:05.520 --> 15:09.187
I, I feel like we never get
to hang out anymore, man.

15:09.189 --> 15:10.655
You alright?

15:10.657 --> 15:12.291
You seem like
you're somewhere else.

15:12.293 --> 15:14.726
Yeah. No, I'm good.

15:14.728 --> 15:18.498
I'm good. I just, I just came
from... seeing the shrink.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.433
Himmelman.
You still seeing that guy?

15:21.435 --> 15:23.101
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

15:23.103 --> 15:25.171
Don't let him mess
with your head too much.

15:25.173 --> 15:27.139
<i>These psych guys,
they-they can cause</i>

15:27.141 --> 15:28.640
more harm than good.

15:28.642 --> 15:30.576
Sometimes, I don't know.
My layman's opinion.

15:32.679 --> 15:34.746
Well...

15:34.748 --> 15:36.349
I'll keep my eye on him.

15:36.351 --> 15:37.549
Good, man.

15:37.551 --> 15:39.384
- Alright?
- Alright.

16:13.154 --> 16:15.120
Isaac? Isaac?

16:15.122 --> 16:16.322
Isaac.

19:21.776 --> 19:23.312
What do you want?

19:27.682 --> 19:29.483
Better keep your mouth shut.

20:05.686 --> 20:07.920
<i>Mr. Singer?</i>

20:07.922 --> 20:10.489
- Mr. Singer?
- What are you doing here?

20:10.491 --> 20:11.957
No, no, no,
I-I gotta get home.

20:11.959 --> 20:14.727
- I gotta get home. Uh...
- They're after you.

20:14.729 --> 20:18.330
You need to be careful.

20:18.332 --> 20:21.599
Just go to the VA,
ask for Dr. Louis Himmelman.

20:21.601 --> 20:24.369
Alright, he's helps out
a lot of veterans.

20:24.371 --> 20:25.973
Better keep your mouth shut.

20:28.342 --> 20:30.343
What'd you say?

20:30.345 --> 20:32.780
Ain't that what he said?
"Better keep your mouth shut."

20:37.018 --> 20:38.917
How do you know about that?

20:38.919 --> 20:41.386
- Your brother's in trouble.
- No.

20:41.388 --> 20:43.324
He's here. Right now.

20:45.460 --> 20:46.728
I can show you.

20:52.567 --> 20:54.900
After that third tour,
I was fuckin' broken, man.

20:54.902 --> 20:58.636
The shit we did over there,
the shit we saw.

20:58.638 --> 21:02.644
Played in my head
like some movie.

21:05.413 --> 21:06.848
All I could see was...

21:10.717 --> 21:11.719
bodies.

21:19.126 --> 21:22.827
Hey, hey. Okay, take it easy.

21:22.829 --> 21:24.732
<i>I hooked up
with some other vets...</i>

21:25.966 --> 21:27.601
that's when I found the ladder.

21:30.137 --> 21:32.605
And that was it, man.

21:32.607 --> 21:34.408
That was the only thing
that helped.

21:37.412 --> 21:38.911
There's abandoned tunnels
runnin'

21:38.913 --> 21:40.848
underneath the entire system.

21:45.453 --> 21:46.988
We had our own world
down there...

21:48.955 --> 21:51.022
for a while.

21:51.024 --> 21:52.426
Not anymore.

21:55.663 --> 21:57.766
- What happened?
- Guys are getting killed.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.903
Did you call the cops?

22:03.905 --> 22:07.807
You...
No, no, no. No way. No.

22:07.809 --> 22:09.974
No cops.

22:09.976 --> 22:12.076
They-they're in on it.

22:12.078 --> 22:15.647
You gotta get Ike out of there,
he's right in the middle of it.

22:15.649 --> 22:18.884
- My brother is dead, Paul.
- No, he's not.

22:18.886 --> 22:20.752
He's not.

22:20.754 --> 22:22.520
He's down there
in those tunnels

22:22.522 --> 22:24.757
and it's not safe.

22:24.759 --> 22:27.026
The government has been giving

22:27.028 --> 22:31.230
a very dangerous
drug... to the vets.

22:31.232 --> 22:35.468
It's called H-D-A.

22:35.470 --> 22:37.635
It was supposed to help with
post-traumatic stress disorder

22:37.637 --> 22:39.907
but all it does
is makes them crazy.

22:42.643 --> 22:47.078
Paul, just calm down.
Calm down.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.716
Jacob, you gotta believe me.

22:50.251 --> 22:51.650
Your brother needs your help...

23:07.068 --> 23:08.834
It's your ID.

23:08.836 --> 23:11.269
Did you hear what I said?

23:11.271 --> 23:14.073
A man was thrown
in front of a train.

23:14.075 --> 23:16.241
Someone threw a garbage bag
onto the tracks.

23:16.243 --> 23:18.009
<i>The conductor nearly
had a stroke.</i>

23:18.011 --> 23:19.744
- <i>But no sign of anything else.</i>
- It's impossible.

23:19.746 --> 23:22.213
It's just not possible.
I know what I saw.

23:22.215 --> 23:24.016
You're a surgeon,
is that right?

23:24.018 --> 23:26.018
Yes, I'm a trauma surgeon.

23:26.020 --> 23:28.721
- I work at the VA.
- <i>Okay.</i>

23:28.723 --> 23:31.757
So, you'd agree with me that
if there were a collision

23:31.759 --> 23:34.259
between a human body
and a moving train,

23:34.261 --> 23:35.661
there might be some
physical evidence, right?

23:35.663 --> 23:38.096
You think I'm making this up?

23:38.098 --> 23:39.467
Is that what you think?

23:41.001 --> 23:44.138
Ask someone, ask around,
someone must have seen them.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.776
Alright. Alright.
We'll make some calls.

23:50.778 --> 23:52.213
While we do...

23:54.682 --> 23:56.117
you should just wait here.

24:00.721 --> 24:01.923
Just forget it.

24:03.089 --> 24:05.827
And thanks for your time.

27:04.805 --> 27:08.173
I know you got something
on you, brother.

27:08.175 --> 27:10.811
- What?
- You holding?

27:13.079 --> 27:14.946
No, no, I'm not holding.

27:14.948 --> 27:17.281
Don't be like that, brother.

27:17.283 --> 27:18.386
Please.

27:21.055 --> 27:23.391
Ahh!

28:06.332 --> 28:07.468
Isaac?

28:08.536 --> 28:10.335
Isaac?

28:10.337 --> 28:13.571
Isaac. Hey. Okay.

28:13.573 --> 28:16.208
Hey, can you hear me?

28:16.210 --> 28:18.042
It's Jacob.

28:18.044 --> 28:19.179
Jake?

28:20.880 --> 28:23.817
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's just me.

28:26.020 --> 28:28.189
I wanna go home, Jake.

28:30.925 --> 28:32.527
I wanna go home.

28:36.896 --> 28:40.432
Okay. Okay, let's get you home.

28:40.434 --> 28:42.366
Come on. Come on.

28:42.368 --> 28:44.838
I, I got you. Come on.

28:51.278 --> 28:54.980
Yeah, that's, that's good.
That's good. Alright.

28:54.982 --> 28:57.551
They're gonna kill me.
They're gonna kill me.

28:59.854 --> 29:02.421
Come on. Let's go.
Let's get you out of here.

29:02.423 --> 29:03.521
They're gonna kill me.

29:09.230 --> 29:11.096
Go. Go.

29:42.396 --> 29:43.530
Isaac?

29:51.371 --> 29:53.271
Oh, my...

29:57.278 --> 29:59.380
Oh, my God.

30:01.447 --> 30:02.550
Oh.

30:08.355 --> 30:09.991
I'll get you some more eggs.

30:29.542 --> 30:30.911
What?

30:33.614 --> 30:35.917
I just can't believe
you're here.

30:41.454 --> 30:43.191
We thought you were dead.

30:48.361 --> 30:49.630
Maybe I was.

31:02.509 --> 31:04.442
I'm gonna go check
on the little guy,

31:04.444 --> 31:06.079
and let you two talk.

31:09.249 --> 31:12.185
Gabriel, what's wrong, baby?

31:22.363 --> 31:26.167
So, uh, who were those guys?

31:27.100 --> 31:28.400
What?

31:28.402 --> 31:30.338
The guys in the tunnel.
Who were they?

31:31.504 --> 31:33.105
I don't know, Jake.

31:33.107 --> 31:35.106
You don't know?

31:35.108 --> 31:36.674
You don't know Paul?

31:36.676 --> 31:39.044
He said he was in your unit.

31:39.046 --> 31:41.712
<i>Yeah,
Paul is the one that lead me to you</i>

31:41.714 --> 31:44.018
and then I saw him murdered.

31:45.049 --> 31:45.784
Someone pushed him
in front of a fucking train.

31:45.786 --> 31:47.451
I just wanna know
what's going on?

31:47.453 --> 31:50.489
I don't know, I-I don't know.

31:50.491 --> 31:53.962
What are you taking?
Just tell me.

31:56.163 --> 31:57.461
You really got
the perfect life here,

31:57.463 --> 31:58.630
don't you, big bro?

31:58.632 --> 32:00.265
I'm just a fucking stain
on it.

32:00.267 --> 32:03.567
- I know.
- Don't do that.

32:03.569 --> 32:05.703
I worked really fucking hard
when I got over there.

32:05.705 --> 32:07.806
And I was good.
You don't know, I was good.

32:07.808 --> 32:10.374
I-I had my own men,
I had my own team.

32:10.376 --> 32:13.045
For the first time in my life,
I was where I was

32:13.047 --> 32:16.114
supposed to be,
doing something.

32:16.116 --> 32:19.050
Yeah, it felt good.

32:19.052 --> 32:21.488
Yeah. I feel good
and then, um...

32:24.558 --> 32:25.626
What?

32:33.634 --> 32:36.434
Isaac. Isaac, you're bleeding.

32:36.436 --> 32:37.405
Isaac!

32:39.705 --> 32:42.042
- I, I got you. I got you.
- What's happening? Jacob!

32:43.476 --> 32:45.443
- What?
- Grab his legs.

32:45.445 --> 32:46.845
- <i>Okay.</i>
- He's burning up.

32:46.847 --> 32:50.615
- <i>Oh!</i>
- Look at me.

32:50.617 --> 32:52.317
- Grab a thermometer.
- Okay.

32:57.124 --> 32:58.355
Come on. Come on, Isaac.
Hold on.

32:58.357 --> 33:00.060
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

33:01.728 --> 33:03.194
We gotta get him in the water.

33:03.196 --> 33:04.429
We gotta get some ice.
Go get ice.

33:04.431 --> 33:06.701
Get me as much ice as possible.
Go.

33:08.801 --> 33:11.271
Okay, I got you.
I got you. I got you.

33:17.344 --> 33:18.876
Pour that ice on him.

33:18.878 --> 33:23.214
Isaac, Isaac, it's me.
It's me. It's me. It's me.

33:23.216 --> 33:25.217
I need you to hold your breath.
I need you to hold your breath.

33:25.219 --> 33:26.250
Come on.

33:34.328 --> 33:36.560
You trying to kill me?
Don't do it.

33:36.562 --> 33:38.596
- Look at me. Look at me.
- <i>Don't kill me.</i>

33:38.598 --> 33:40.434
Look at me. One more time.
Hold your breath. Come on.

33:41.801 --> 33:43.404
More ice. More ice.

35:10.856 --> 35:12.726
I'm sorry, man.

35:24.470 --> 35:27.742
I had a dream
about granddad's farm.

35:29.843 --> 35:32.776
I love that place.

35:32.778 --> 35:35.846
I saw that old fishin' hole
barely any fish in it.

35:35.848 --> 35:38.185
He taught us in.

35:40.419 --> 35:42.222
<i>You remember all that stuff?</i>

35:44.357 --> 35:47.524
All I remember is we didn't
catch a fuckin' thing.

35:47.526 --> 35:49.326
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- You know?

35:49.328 --> 35:52.863
Dad was pouring beer on
all the, all the worms.

35:52.865 --> 35:55.600
- "One for them, one for me."
- Yeah. Right.

35:55.602 --> 35:56.771
Right.

36:00.573 --> 36:02.842
Yeah, I think about that place
a lot.

36:05.444 --> 36:07.479
Me too.

36:07.481 --> 36:09.417
<i>You're gonna die.</i>

36:11.685 --> 36:13.487
Do you think I'm going to hell?

36:19.292 --> 36:21.759
What? No, of course not.

36:21.761 --> 36:23.595
I think maybe hell
are these memories

36:23.597 --> 36:25.562
that I can't get rid of.

36:25.564 --> 36:29.834
The faces, all the faces
I can't stop seeing.

36:29.836 --> 36:33.071
No. Hey. Look, you're home.

36:33.073 --> 36:35.807
Okay? You're home.

36:35.809 --> 36:37.278
Look at me.

36:38.511 --> 36:40.879
- You're safe.
- Yeah.

36:40.881 --> 36:42.980
Alright?

36:42.982 --> 36:44.649
Okay.

36:44.651 --> 36:46.584
Okay.

36:46.586 --> 36:48.522
When you wake up,
you'll feel better.

37:36.970 --> 37:39.002
How is he?

37:39.004 --> 37:42.406
It's worse than before.
He seems different.

37:42.408 --> 37:44.377
Like it's not even Isaac.

37:45.544 --> 37:47.511
He's gonna be okay.

37:47.513 --> 37:49.580
I-I don't know what he got
himself mixed up in

37:49.582 --> 37:52.352
but I-I'm gonna take care of it.
You don't have to worry.

37:57.656 --> 37:59.022
<i>Doctor?</i>

37:59.024 --> 38:00.394
Doctor.

38:02.396 --> 38:03.995
I've been trying to reach you.

38:03.997 --> 38:06.997
Yeah, I've been in sessions
all morning.

38:06.999 --> 38:09.600
I, um,
I need to talk to you.

38:09.602 --> 38:12.837
No, Jacob. You need to
schedule an appointment.

38:12.839 --> 38:14.439
I know, look, I'm sorry.

38:14.441 --> 38:16.707
It's just that I was already
at the hospital, okay?

38:16.709 --> 38:18.042
- And I've just been...
- <i>Jacob...</i>

38:18.044 --> 38:21.513
Um, can we catch up
with you in next session?

38:21.515 --> 38:23.814
I gotta get downtown
for a meeting.

38:23.816 --> 38:25.685
I'm-I'm running late, so...

38:27.153 --> 38:28.955
Isaac is alive.

38:36.196 --> 38:38.897
I know it sounds crazy.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.568
I do, but he is.

38:42.169 --> 38:44.935
Your brother, Isaac Singer,
is alive?

38:44.937 --> 38:47.474
Yes. He is alive.

38:49.109 --> 38:51.475
- Are you certain it's him?
- Yeah.

38:51.477 --> 38:52.810
How can that be?

38:52.812 --> 38:56.180
I thought he was air lifted
to Germany.

38:56.182 --> 38:59.984
And you told me
that he died en route.

38:59.986 --> 39:01.989
He's at my house right now
with Sam.

39:04.024 --> 39:05.990
It's incredible, Jacob.

39:05.992 --> 39:07.991
I, um...

39:07.993 --> 39:11.930
never saw his body.

39:11.932 --> 39:14.765
We just saw coffins,
so they must've just...

39:14.767 --> 39:16.968
Some dumb fucking clerical
mistake, I don't know.

39:16.970 --> 39:19.504
But I promise you he is here.

39:19.506 --> 39:20.774
It's him.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.178
He's not in a good way though.

39:26.780 --> 39:29.680
He's seeing things
and he's hearing things.

39:29.682 --> 39:31.182
What sort of things?

39:31.184 --> 39:33.551
I-I, I don't know.

39:33.553 --> 39:35.522
Faces. Demons.

39:36.789 --> 39:38.124
We all see things.

39:40.227 --> 39:43.160
But he needs professional help.
He should come in.

39:43.162 --> 39:46.531
He thinks he's going to hell.

39:46.533 --> 39:49.767
Jacob, the only thing
that burns in hell

39:49.769 --> 39:52.772
is the part of yourself
that refuses to let go.

39:54.707 --> 39:57.674
Remember <i>Meister</i> Eckhart?

39:57.676 --> 40:01.178
He said, "If you are
frightened to die

40:01.180 --> 40:03.848
"and you're holding on

40:03.850 --> 40:06.984
"then you will see battles
tearing your life apart

40:06.986 --> 40:11.622
"but once you made
your peace, then the devils...

40:11.624 --> 40:14.694
are angels freeing you
from this earth."

40:17.863 --> 40:19.566
<i>It's all on how you look at it.</i>

40:48.227 --> 40:52.796
- Can I help you?
- Yes, please.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.299
Yeah, let's get you a nurse.

40:54.301 --> 40:56.633
- Hey!
- I need it.

40:56.635 --> 40:58.937
Take it easy.

40:58.939 --> 41:00.872
Just come with me.

41:00.874 --> 41:02.642
Alright, come with me.

41:08.080 --> 41:10.184
Okay, let's go in here.
Okay?

41:16.156 --> 41:19.089
Okay. Just, you know what?
Just have a seat right here.

41:19.091 --> 41:20.625
There you go.

41:20.627 --> 41:22.859
Just relax,
I'm gonna go get a nurse.

41:22.861 --> 41:24.064
Alright?

41:37.676 --> 41:39.012
What?

41:42.915 --> 41:44.084
Hey, buddy.

41:45.385 --> 41:46.886
Hey.

42:16.415 --> 42:19.350
Hey! Hey, did you see a homeless
vet run out of here?

42:19.352 --> 42:21.352
No.

42:21.354 --> 42:24.689
He just, he just attacked me.

42:24.691 --> 42:26.290
You okay?

42:26.292 --> 42:28.692
Yeah, what's going on
with these guys?

42:28.694 --> 42:30.861
Had one last week that almost
chewed off his own finger.

42:49.249 --> 42:51.314
Hoffman!

42:51.316 --> 42:53.283
- <i>Hoffman!</i>
- Yeah.

42:53.285 --> 42:54.988
It's Jacob. Open up.

42:56.423 --> 42:58.288
Hey, man.

42:58.290 --> 42:59.693
Come in.

43:00.760 --> 43:01.962
You alright?

43:07.267 --> 43:08.669
You okay?

43:10.336 --> 43:12.770
<i>Sorry, I couldn't hear you.</i>

43:12.772 --> 43:14.040
You want a beer?

43:15.908 --> 43:18.910
I-I'm sorry to bust in on you
like this. I just...

43:18.912 --> 43:21.915
I kind of have a situation
at home.

43:23.716 --> 43:25.685
You want-you wanna take a seat?

43:29.888 --> 43:31.425
Okay, I'll, uh...

43:33.193 --> 43:34.395
What?

43:36.396 --> 43:38.231
I wanna know what this is?

43:41.868 --> 43:43.433
How do you mean?

43:43.435 --> 43:47.839
Hoffman, what I'm asking you,
is what this is?

43:47.841 --> 43:49.143
What's it called?

43:53.312 --> 43:56.113
I think it's HDA.

43:56.115 --> 43:59.350
Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor.

43:59.352 --> 44:01.017
It targets traumatic memories.

44:01.019 --> 44:03.754
The vets, they call it
"The Ladder."

44:03.756 --> 44:06.323
The VA had been prescribing it
for sometime for PTSD

44:06.325 --> 44:08.759
but it got shelved.

44:08.761 --> 44:10.194
Bad side effects or some shit.

44:10.196 --> 44:13.000
Th-the fucking FDA
are bunch of pussies.

44:15.535 --> 44:18.468
I-I think people maybe
getting killed because of this.

44:18.470 --> 44:20.303
Come on.

44:20.305 --> 44:22.506
Hoffman, I saw it.

44:22.508 --> 44:25.042
Did you report this?

44:25.044 --> 44:28.145
I-I, I told the cops.

44:28.147 --> 44:30.548
Look, um...

44:30.550 --> 44:33.216
My brother's using this shit,
so I-I...

44:33.218 --> 44:35.852
I gotta find out
where it's coming from.

44:35.854 --> 44:37.955
Your brother?

44:37.957 --> 44:39.991
Yeah.

44:39.993 --> 44:41.328
I don't know.

44:43.328 --> 44:45.428
I'll ask around, I'll see what
I can find out.

44:45.430 --> 44:48.499
I can't make any promises,
but...

44:48.501 --> 44:50.468
There's some people I know
that...

44:50.470 --> 44:52.236
I'll see what I can do.

44:52.238 --> 44:55.142
Okay. Okay.

44:56.542 --> 44:59.312
- Thanks.
- Let me take this.

45:02.816 --> 45:04.051
Of course.

45:09.421 --> 45:12.156
<i>Uh, Jake.
Be careful.</i>

45:12.158 --> 45:14.060
You gotta watch out
who you talk to.

45:30.943 --> 45:33.144
Hey, baby.

45:33.146 --> 45:35.379
- What are you doing?
- Where have you been?

45:35.381 --> 45:36.546
- Get off of me.
- Where you've been?

45:36.548 --> 45:37.816
Get off me.

45:40.486 --> 45:43.824
<i>Come back.
Where are you going?</i>

45:46.559 --> 45:48.060
Come back.

46:23.595 --> 46:26.296
Couldn't keep your mouth shut?

46:26.298 --> 46:27.631
Hey!

46:27.633 --> 46:29.202
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

46:34.240 --> 46:36.573
You alright, man?

46:36.575 --> 46:37.908
You want me to call the cops?

46:37.910 --> 46:40.076
No. No. No cops.

46:40.078 --> 46:42.446
- No cops.
- Alright.

46:44.017 --> 46:46.049
I'm okay. Thanks.

46:46.051 --> 46:47.053
I'm okay.

47:10.542 --> 47:12.979
Okay. Here we go.

47:18.584 --> 47:20.921
- You're bleeding.
- It's nothing.

47:23.289 --> 47:25.225
Can you get me some ice, please?

47:32.432 --> 47:35.334
You tell me right now
what fuck is going on?

47:37.135 --> 47:38.234
What are you...

47:38.236 --> 47:40.638
What are you talking about,
Jake?

47:40.640 --> 47:42.605
I found that HDA in your coat.

47:42.607 --> 47:44.341
You're going through my stuff?

47:44.343 --> 47:45.709
You bringing that shit
into my house

47:45.711 --> 47:48.479
where Gabe sleeps?
Really?

47:48.481 --> 47:51.082
What? I...
What are you talking about?

47:51.084 --> 47:52.519
Forget it. Forget it.

47:55.455 --> 47:57.754
Thank you.

47:57.756 --> 48:01.558
I need you to grab some clothes
and an, and an overnight bag.

48:01.560 --> 48:04.095
- Jake, what is going on?
- Sam, please.

48:04.097 --> 48:07.531
I just need you and Gabe
to be somewhere safe.

48:07.533 --> 48:10.401
- Alright?
- Yeah, let's, um, let's do it.

48:10.403 --> 48:11.705
Let's do what Jake says.

48:25.450 --> 48:28.218
I, um, I know you're upset.

48:28.220 --> 48:30.189
Sam, I need you to
listen to me, please.

48:32.624 --> 48:35.061
What the hell is going on
with you lately?

48:36.763 --> 48:39.696
There are these people
that are after me.

48:39.698 --> 48:42.633
- What?
- They broke into the house, Sam.

48:42.635 --> 48:44.634
- What house? This house?
- Yes.

48:44.636 --> 48:46.569
I know I, I should've-I
should've told you.

48:46.571 --> 48:48.605
Let me get this straight.

48:48.607 --> 48:50.241
Someone broke into my house

48:50.243 --> 48:53.243
and I'm just finding out
about it now?

48:53.245 --> 48:54.812
- Yeah.
- There's a family here.

48:54.814 --> 48:56.346
We have a family...

48:56.348 --> 48:57.814
I know, and I'm trying,

48:57.816 --> 49:00.151
I'm trying to protect
this family.

49:00.153 --> 49:03.520
I know, Sam,
but this is serious.

49:03.522 --> 49:05.024
Trust me.

49:07.160 --> 49:10.428
I think it has to do

49:10.430 --> 49:14.598
<i>with drugs and these two
fucked up guys</i>

49:14.600 --> 49:16.100
that are following my brother.

49:16.102 --> 49:18.201
You're scaring me.
Stop. Stop it.

49:18.203 --> 49:19.303
Whatever you're talking about,

49:19.305 --> 49:21.538
drugs and whoever's involved,

49:21.540 --> 49:24.443
I can't do this. So, yeah,
I'll go to the hotel with Gabe.

49:26.345 --> 49:28.678
But this is the last time
I'm leaving my house.

49:28.680 --> 49:30.180
Ever.

49:30.182 --> 49:31.617
Figure it out.

49:35.821 --> 49:37.490
<i>Come here. Yeah, baby.</i>

49:38.557 --> 49:39.626
Here we go.

49:44.097 --> 49:46.196
It's gonna be okay.

49:46.198 --> 49:47.566
I'll call you later.

49:58.743 --> 50:01.511
Isaac. Isaac!

50:01.513 --> 50:03.082
Isaac!

50:39.919 --> 50:42.321
No. No! No! No! No!

50:43.421 --> 50:45.555
Oh, no, no, no! Jake!

50:45.557 --> 50:48.258
- What is wrong with you?
- Jake.

50:48.260 --> 50:49.859
Oh, you fuckin' don't know
what you're doing?

50:49.861 --> 50:52.629
What? What don't I know? What?

50:52.631 --> 50:55.232
Now you wanna know about me?

50:55.234 --> 50:57.334
Yeah.

50:57.336 --> 51:01.939
Now you care about me, huh?
No, you don't.

51:01.941 --> 51:04.542
- <i>Just tell me.</i>
- Not a damn thing.

51:04.544 --> 51:07.278
<i>Just tell me. Hey. Hey.</i>

51:07.280 --> 51:09.749
- Oh!
- <i>Tell me what happened?</i>

51:19.926 --> 51:21.892
We shouldn't have gone in there.

51:21.894 --> 51:24.694
We're operating at altitude,

51:24.696 --> 51:26.432
together exhausted...

51:28.334 --> 51:29.899
<i>It should've been routine.</i>

51:29.901 --> 51:33.203
<i>Simple snatch and grab
of an enemy combatant.</i>

51:33.205 --> 51:35.908
<i>The minute we got in that
village it felt wrong and I...</i>

51:38.644 --> 51:40.611
I let 'em into it.

51:40.613 --> 51:41.979
Down. Now! Go!

51:41.981 --> 51:44.515
It's a fucking ambush!

51:48.254 --> 51:51.254
I can still see them though.

51:51.256 --> 51:52.555
Everyday.

51:52.557 --> 51:54.491
Smell them,
I fucking hear them,

51:54.493 --> 51:57.361
I can't sleep.

51:57.363 --> 52:00.296
All those bodies are in my head.

52:00.298 --> 52:02.566
They're right here.

52:02.568 --> 52:05.903
This shit, this drug...

52:05.905 --> 52:09.441
is the only thing that's
ever helped me, Jacob.

52:10.575 --> 52:13.444
No.

52:13.446 --> 52:15.645
Look at yourself.

52:15.647 --> 52:17.950
Look at what this shit is
doing to you, Isaac.

52:20.019 --> 52:22.519
Who's giving it to you?

52:22.521 --> 52:23.789
Hmm?

52:26.725 --> 52:27.961
Oh, she's here.

53:21.881 --> 53:23.516
Jacob.

53:26.618 --> 53:27.787
Hey.

53:29.455 --> 53:31.558
I had the strangest dream.

53:34.493 --> 53:35.761
<i>Jacob...</i>

53:38.330 --> 53:39.732
Jacob.

53:41.566 --> 53:43.334
<i>Jacob...</i>

53:43.336 --> 53:44.638
Jacob.

53:47.872 --> 53:50.741
<i>Jacob. Jacob.</i>

53:50.743 --> 53:52.746
It's okay. You're okay.

53:54.412 --> 53:55.914
<i>You hit your head pretty hard.</i>

53:58.050 --> 53:59.582
Where is Sam?

53:59.584 --> 54:02.019
She's here.

54:02.021 --> 54:05.756
Relax. Isaac's here, too.

54:05.758 --> 54:07.660
Jacob, easy.

54:12.798 --> 54:14.501
Where did you go?
We were scared.

54:16.435 --> 54:20.069
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't remember.

54:20.071 --> 54:22.673
Where were you?

54:22.675 --> 54:25.845
What do you mean?
Jake, you disappeared on me.

54:27.912 --> 54:29.779
<i>Take some time.</i>

54:29.781 --> 54:32.716
We can get everything
sorted out later, okay?

54:42.928 --> 54:45.595
<i>Hey, ah, I need to see you.</i>

54:45.597 --> 54:47.029
<i>This is some dark shit.</i>

54:47.031 --> 54:48.531
<i>I-I don't wanna do this
over the phone.</i>

54:48.533 --> 54:50.466
<i>Can you meet me?</i>

54:50.468 --> 54:52.002
I was right, wasn't I?

54:52.004 --> 54:53.940
<i>You'll see when you get here.</i>

55:20.432 --> 55:22.533
Where are we?

55:22.535 --> 55:24.667
- Does it do other things?
- What?

55:24.669 --> 55:26.602
The HDA.

55:26.604 --> 55:28.439
What do you mean, man?

55:28.441 --> 55:30.607
Does it make you see things
that aren't there?

55:30.609 --> 55:32.743
<i>What are you talking
about, Jake?</i>

55:32.745 --> 55:34.481
Why would you ask me that?

55:42.655 --> 55:45.721
Wh-what exactly is this guy
suppose to be telling us anyway?

55:45.723 --> 55:46.924
He knows.

55:46.926 --> 55:48.828
He knows who's making this shit.

55:50.963 --> 55:52.629
They're the ones
that are coming after us.

55:53.798 --> 55:55.466
Ah! Get in the car!

55:55.468 --> 55:56.836
Get in the car!

56:00.872 --> 56:02.839
- Ah!
- Get down! Get down!

56:08.247 --> 56:10.015
What the fuck, Jake?

56:23.194 --> 56:25.097
Truck, truck, truck!

56:33.772 --> 56:35.705
- <i>They set me up.</i>
- They're gone.

56:35.707 --> 56:37.040
Jake.

56:37.042 --> 56:39.075
Okay, they're gone.

56:39.077 --> 56:40.512
What?

56:42.113 --> 56:43.215
Hey...

56:49.588 --> 56:51.687
<i>Hoffman sent them.</i>

56:51.689 --> 56:54.124
<i>I never heard
you mention him before.</i>

56:54.126 --> 56:56.292
- Who is Hoffman?
- <i>He must be the one.</i>

56:56.294 --> 56:57.761
<i>He must be the one
that's making it.</i>

56:57.763 --> 56:59.165
<i>The HDA. He's...</i>

57:00.899 --> 57:02.202
Listen...

57:06.104 --> 57:07.740
I wanted to tell you sooner.

57:09.841 --> 57:11.575
But I didn't want to scare you.

57:11.577 --> 57:14.845
These guys,
these guys, they-they...

57:14.847 --> 57:17.714
threatened me.

57:17.716 --> 57:20.185
Hoffman must have
sent them again...

57:23.155 --> 57:24.787
to kill me.

57:24.789 --> 57:26.122
Okay, maybe we need to
call the police.

57:26.124 --> 57:28.191
No. No, no, no.
We can't. We can't.

57:28.193 --> 57:29.692
Jacob, someone is
threatening you.

57:29.694 --> 57:32.328
- No cops. No cops.
- Okay, Jake.

57:32.330 --> 57:33.765
No cops.

57:36.702 --> 57:38.571
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

57:42.975 --> 57:45.676
They're all fucking in on it.

57:45.678 --> 57:49.279
<i>You don't get it.
They're coming after us.</i>

57:49.281 --> 57:52.082
What is that...
What is that noise?

57:52.084 --> 57:54.216
- <i>What is that noise?</i>
- <i>What noise, Jake?</i>

57:54.218 --> 57:56.054
That fucking clicking noise.

57:58.057 --> 57:59.192
Ah!

58:04.897 --> 58:07.267
Jake, it's okay.

58:17.843 --> 58:19.546
Jake.

58:31.856 --> 58:33.292
Fuck!

58:39.765 --> 58:41.667
What is going on?

58:52.044 --> 58:54.044
Oh!

58:54.046 --> 58:57.180
Look, don't, okay?

58:58.651 --> 59:00.017
What are fuck are you doing?

59:00.019 --> 59:02.685
- Hey, hey, hey. Look.
- Jacob.

59:02.687 --> 59:04.687
- Jacob.
- We're okay.

59:04.689 --> 59:06.122
- Jacob, stop!
- Oh, oh, okay, man.

59:06.124 --> 59:07.390
- Don't fucking touch her!
- Hey!

59:07.392 --> 59:09.258
Jacob, stop! Jacob!

59:09.260 --> 59:12.197
You think you can just show up
and fuck up my life? Hm?

59:15.033 --> 59:17.299
What's happening? Huh?

59:17.301 --> 59:19.002
- Ah!
- Stop it!

59:20.772 --> 59:22.238
<i>You're scaring the baby. Go!</i>

59:22.240 --> 59:23.709
Just go!

59:28.113 --> 59:29.745
Go.

01:00:20.932 --> 01:00:22.899
Excuse me.

01:00:22.901 --> 01:00:25.836
You know the guy who
works in this lab?

01:00:25.838 --> 01:00:27.006
Excuse me.

01:00:28.906 --> 01:00:31.243
I'm looking for the guy
who works in this lab.

01:01:20.359 --> 01:01:21.857
<i>Jake.</i>

01:01:21.859 --> 01:01:23.328
<i>Everyone's looking for you.</i>

01:01:45.551 --> 01:01:48.221
You two seem like
you're having a good time.

01:01:50.888 --> 01:01:54.327
Why can't you just,
just be happy for her?

01:01:55.993 --> 01:01:57.363
For both of us.

01:02:01.566 --> 01:02:03.068
Sure thing, Jake.

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:06.205
It's your party.

01:02:10.042 --> 01:02:11.144
<i>Get you something?</i>

01:02:13.044 --> 01:02:15.247
Hate to see the groom
walking around empty handed.

01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:26.158
Uh, I'm sorry, everyone. I think
maybe we have one more speaker.

01:02:30.229 --> 01:02:32.194
<i>Brother of the
groom here just, ah...</i>

01:02:32.196 --> 01:02:34.064
<i>Just gotta say
a couple of words.</i>

01:02:34.066 --> 01:02:36.332
<i>Just wanna say
that I love my brother</i>

01:02:36.334 --> 01:02:40.569
and I have always
looked up to him.

01:02:40.571 --> 01:02:42.638
<i>Right? I mean, he's, he is
the good one, you know?</i>

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.609
He's-he's got the good grades,
and, uh, and, uh, and varsity.

01:02:46.611 --> 01:02:48.410
Everything, I know, I did.

01:02:48.412 --> 01:02:50.446
You know,
there was this one girl...

01:02:50.448 --> 01:02:54.149
And I was so crazy about her.

01:02:54.151 --> 01:02:57.220
So crazy about her.
It could really hurt.

01:02:57.222 --> 01:02:59.288
And that's how I felt.

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:03.627
And I-I couldn't imagine
losing her, you know?

01:03:03.629 --> 01:03:05.531
Especially not to my brother.

01:03:08.966 --> 01:03:11.368
What I came up her for?
I came up here to make a toast.

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:14.173
To true love.

01:03:15.573 --> 01:03:18.341
Can't forget family
all important.

01:03:18.343 --> 01:03:20.977
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

01:03:20.979 --> 01:03:23.381
I had her first.
Now you remember that.

01:03:25.617 --> 01:03:27.053
Oh!

01:03:28.953 --> 01:03:30.222
"Oh!"

01:03:35.193 --> 01:03:38.160
Hello? Young man?

01:03:38.162 --> 01:03:40.562
<i>Hello.</i>

01:03:40.564 --> 01:03:42.999
Anybody there?

01:03:43.001 --> 01:03:44.970
Young man? Are you okay?

01:03:48.339 --> 01:03:50.575
Young man?
Are you okay?

01:04:35.519 --> 01:04:37.988
Jesus, Jake...

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:39.191
Oh, you scared me.

01:04:41.526 --> 01:04:42.928
How did you get in?

01:04:45.129 --> 01:04:46.932
The window.

01:04:50.669 --> 01:04:52.471
I couldn't find my key.

01:04:56.408 --> 01:04:57.910
I'm glad you're okay.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.582
Where were you
this whole time?

01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:07.153
It doesn't matter.

01:05:09.588 --> 01:05:13.091
The important thing is,
now, I know...

01:05:14.526 --> 01:05:15.995
I see...

01:05:17.194 --> 01:05:19.395
It was all my fault.

01:05:19.397 --> 01:05:21.968
- What was your fault?
- Everything.

01:05:23.435 --> 01:05:25.267
I'm gonna go get Isaac, okay?

01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:28.206
Sam, wait, just hear me out.
Please, okay? I fucked up.

01:05:30.307 --> 01:05:34.076
I fucked up and,
and I know I need help.

01:05:34.078 --> 01:05:37.080
Yeah, you've been,
you've been trying to tell me...

01:05:37.082 --> 01:05:39.085
And I haven't been listening,
but I'm...

01:05:41.486 --> 01:05:43.189
I'm listening now.

01:05:49.127 --> 01:05:50.692
Oh, Jake...

01:05:50.694 --> 01:05:52.765
I need you to know that
I want things...

01:05:55.667 --> 01:05:58.734
I want to get us back
to the way we were.

01:05:58.736 --> 01:06:00.370
Okay?

01:06:00.372 --> 01:06:01.805
I want to get us back
to the way we were.

01:06:01.807 --> 01:06:03.238
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.573
- I'll do whatever it takes.
- Okay.

01:06:04.575 --> 01:06:06.709
I'll do whatever you want.

01:06:06.711 --> 01:06:09.745
I'll get more counseling,
I'll-I'll, I'll see Louis

01:06:09.747 --> 01:06:11.448
everyday if that's
what it takes.

01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:13.685
Okay? Just-just...
You just...

01:06:15.419 --> 01:06:17.756
Just-just tell me
it's-it's, uh...

01:06:20.325 --> 01:06:24.194
It's-it's not too late
for us.

01:06:24.196 --> 01:06:26.796
- Jacob. Jacob!
- Tell me.

01:06:26.798 --> 01:06:30.232
Hey, hey. Hey, when did you...

01:06:30.234 --> 01:06:32.604
Jesus, where the hell
have you been, Jacob?

01:06:37.142 --> 01:06:38.841
Isaac, just back off, alright?

01:06:38.843 --> 01:06:41.845
This is between me and Sam,
please.

01:06:41.847 --> 01:06:43.249
<i>What is?</i>

01:06:45.684 --> 01:06:47.883
I'm trying...

01:06:47.885 --> 01:06:50.319
I'm trying to just save
my marriage.

01:06:50.321 --> 01:06:53.189
Alright. How about-how about
you and I take a walk, huh?

01:06:53.191 --> 01:06:55.394
Sam, just talk to me, please.
Just...

01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:01.397
- She's my wife.
- Oh!

01:07:01.399 --> 01:07:02.665
- Look...
- What is it?

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:04.837
Jake, listen...

01:07:08.272 --> 01:07:10.542
You're not married to Sam.

01:07:11.642 --> 01:07:14.444
You were never married to Sam.

01:07:14.446 --> 01:07:16.446
- I'm married to Sam.
- No!

01:07:16.448 --> 01:07:18.580
- No! No! No!
- Jake...

01:07:18.582 --> 01:07:20.716
God!

01:07:20.718 --> 01:07:23.620
Sam, tell him. Tell him.
Tell him.

01:07:23.622 --> 01:07:26.225
- Jake, I'm telling you.
- No!

01:07:33.932 --> 01:07:36.399
Jake! Jacob!

01:08:04.196 --> 01:08:07.229
Give me! Give me back!
Give me back my watch.

01:08:07.231 --> 01:08:08.798
- Give me back my watch!
- <i>He's gonna make...</i>

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.236
Let him see it.
He needs to see it.

01:08:21.645 --> 01:08:23.381
<i>Jake, stop.</i>

01:08:36.493 --> 01:08:38.264
Oh, my God.

01:08:47.904 --> 01:08:49.341
What is happening?

01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:52.411
I know it's hard, Jake.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:55.747
It's okay.

01:08:59.251 --> 01:09:00.983
- Oh, God!
- <i>It's okay.</i>

01:09:00.984 --> 01:09:03.419
<i>Oh, God!</i>

01:09:37.354 --> 01:09:39.921
Hey, just hold on, okay?

01:09:39.923 --> 01:09:42.291
He's still breathing.

01:09:42.292 --> 01:09:45.529
Love and family.

01:10:05.883 --> 01:10:08.518
Take it easy.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.821
Okay? You're home now...

01:10:11.823 --> 01:10:13.355
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

01:10:13.357 --> 01:10:14.956
- Ooh!
- <i>Oh!</i>

01:10:14.958 --> 01:10:16.261
- <i>Jacob.</i>
- <i>Hey!</i>

01:10:18.829 --> 01:10:20.431
<i>We're right here, okay?</i>

01:10:32.543 --> 01:10:33.811
<i>Jacob.</i>

01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:37.283
Ga-Gabriel?

01:10:39.351 --> 01:10:41.687
He's not-he's not...

01:10:43.788 --> 01:10:45.290
Oh!

01:10:53.797 --> 01:10:55.831
Ooh!

01:10:59.037 --> 01:11:00.039
Alright.

01:11:10.481 --> 01:11:11.984
You and Gabriel...

01:11:14.452 --> 01:11:15.721
were everything.

01:11:19.857 --> 01:11:22.125
Jake. Jake.

01:11:22.127 --> 01:11:24.893
Here's to new family.

01:11:24.895 --> 01:11:27.665
Alright? We're still
your family, Jake.

01:11:33.738 --> 01:11:35.973
I know, bud.
You okay.

01:11:42.614 --> 01:11:44.179
Easy.

01:11:44.181 --> 01:11:45.581
Hey, hey!

01:11:45.583 --> 01:11:47.052
- Jake!
- Go!

01:12:29.627 --> 01:12:31.696
Stop. Stop! Hold here.

01:12:35.999 --> 01:12:37.899
Ward ten, ward ten.
This is Singer.

01:12:37.901 --> 01:12:40.001
<i>I got eyes on the target.
Permission to engage.</i>

01:12:40.003 --> 01:12:41.636
<i>Negative, Singer.
Do not engage.</i>

01:12:41.638 --> 01:12:43.840
What do you want to do, sarg?

01:12:43.842 --> 01:12:46.843
We're not losing him again.

01:12:46.845 --> 01:12:49.511
- Let's go, move out.
- <i>Move out! On me! On me!</i>

01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:53.585
- <i>You're with me though.</i>
- <i>On my six.</i>

01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:00.822
Watch up top.

01:13:00.824 --> 01:13:02.992
Skipper, I got a really
bad feeling about this one.

01:13:02.994 --> 01:13:04.463
Somethin' don't seem right.

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:22.745
Stop! Stop!
It's a fucking ambush!

01:13:27.217 --> 01:13:29.551
- Oh!
- <i>Mohammed!</i>

01:13:39.998 --> 01:13:41.863
Rutiger! Rutiger!

01:13:41.865 --> 01:13:43.965
<i>Come on, watch out!</i>

01:13:45.537 --> 01:13:46.704
Oh!

01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:20.939
Jacob?

01:14:22.239 --> 01:14:23.738
Hmm. Hmm.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:25.676
Hey, Jacob.

01:14:28.245 --> 01:14:29.714
Hey...

01:14:43.226 --> 01:14:46.531
I promised him.
I promised him.

01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:53.905
I got what you're looking for.

01:14:57.007 --> 01:14:58.010
Right here.

01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:11.152
You okay, Jacob?

01:15:11.154 --> 01:15:12.623
You know me?

01:15:14.958 --> 01:15:15.927
Yeah.

01:15:18.363 --> 01:15:20.832
You always say that
you won't be back...

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.336
but you always come back.

01:17:12.877 --> 01:17:15.847
Hey, it's Ike.
Hay, hey, you hear me?

01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:19.380
Hey, hey. It's me. Hey.

01:17:19.382 --> 01:17:20.750
- Isaac?
- Yeah.

01:17:20.752 --> 01:17:23.318
Isaac? How did you get here?

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.519
What do you mean?
She called me.

01:17:24.521 --> 01:17:28.424
- She what?
- She called me. Okay?

01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:29.925
I found his number
on your phone.

01:17:29.927 --> 01:17:31.460
I didn't know
what else to do.

01:17:31.462 --> 01:17:34.897
- Why'd you come here?
- What are you talking about?

01:17:34.899 --> 01:17:37.767
Jake, you're my brother
for fuck's sake. Come on. No!

01:17:37.769 --> 01:17:41.002
Jake, no! No!

01:17:41.004 --> 01:17:43.505
- I'm not gonna...
- You are.

01:17:43.507 --> 01:17:44.773
That's the thing, alright?

01:17:44.775 --> 01:17:46.142
I know all about the fucking
HDA.

01:17:46.144 --> 01:17:47.843
Alright? It's not you.

01:17:47.845 --> 01:17:49.411
It's the drug.

01:17:49.413 --> 01:17:51.212
It's not Jacob. Alright?

01:17:51.214 --> 01:17:55.050
Isaac, it was nice.

01:17:55.052 --> 01:17:56.417
It was nice.

01:17:56.419 --> 01:17:58.286
What was nice?

01:17:58.288 --> 01:18:00.322
What was it?

01:18:00.324 --> 01:18:01.793
Your life.

01:18:03.226 --> 01:18:06.497
Living it for a while,
it was nice.

01:18:08.365 --> 01:18:09.898
Good.

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:13.001
- Alright. Okay. Here we go.
- Okay. Okay.

01:18:13.003 --> 01:18:14.937
<i>Jacob...</i>

01:18:14.939 --> 01:18:18.374
Don't leave, Jake.
Jake, stay. Stay here!

01:18:18.376 --> 01:18:20.242
- <i>I can't make it stop.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:18:20.244 --> 01:18:22.577
I keep hearin' 'em. I...

01:18:22.579 --> 01:18:23.879
Okay.

01:18:23.881 --> 01:18:26.581
Tell me where he is. Tell me.

01:18:26.583 --> 01:18:28.584
Tell me. Hoffman!

01:18:28.586 --> 01:18:31.853
Did you tell him? Tell me.

01:18:31.855 --> 01:18:32.857
Tell me.

01:18:33.591 --> 01:18:35.090
Please.

01:18:35.092 --> 01:18:36.061
Okay.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.899
Fuck! Jake!

01:18:44.901 --> 01:18:45.870
Jake!

01:18:47.437 --> 01:18:48.571
Jake, hold on.

01:19:01.418 --> 01:19:02.419
<i>Jake!</i>

01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:10.227
<i>Jake!</i>

01:19:22.272 --> 01:19:24.939
Fuck! What the fuck?

01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:27.910
Hey, Jake! Stop.

01:19:27.912 --> 01:19:31.447
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

01:19:31.449 --> 01:19:34.049
<i>Hey, take it easy,
take it easy!</i>

01:19:34.051 --> 01:19:35.651
Why are you trying to kill me?

01:19:35.653 --> 01:19:37.118
- What? No.
- You're trying to kill me!

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.255
I'm not trying to kill anybody.
Stop, Jake.

01:19:39.257 --> 01:19:41.023
<i>Jake!</i>

01:19:41.025 --> 01:19:42.027
Jake!

01:19:43.628 --> 01:19:45.627
I got you.

01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:47.598
You got your brother involved?

01:19:50.133 --> 01:19:52.902
You need help, Jake.
He needs help.

01:19:52.904 --> 01:19:55.970
You're reconstructing HDA
in this shit hole?

01:19:55.972 --> 01:19:59.073
I'm improving it,
i-is actually what I'm doing.

01:19:59.075 --> 01:20:00.242
Your brother needs help.

01:20:00.244 --> 01:20:02.044
T-testing it on vets.

01:20:02.046 --> 01:20:03.946
I-it's destroying me.

01:20:03.948 --> 01:20:06.447
It's not perfect.
I'm still working on it.

01:20:06.449 --> 01:20:08.317
I-I'm, I'm close.

01:20:08.319 --> 01:20:11.452
Just s-stop, stop!

01:20:11.454 --> 01:20:14.456
What the fuck is this stuff?

01:20:14.458 --> 01:20:17.960
- D-don't do that!
- How many fucking...

01:20:17.962 --> 01:20:19.661
Jake? Jake? Hey, Jake.

01:20:19.663 --> 01:20:21.330
<i>I've been trying to help you.</i>

01:20:21.332 --> 01:20:23.365
No one was helping these guys.
No one!

01:20:23.367 --> 01:20:25.600
No one helping you.
No one cares.

01:20:25.602 --> 01:20:28.170
I-I-I'm the only one
who's trying to do something.

01:20:28.172 --> 01:20:29.505
I'm the only one
who's trying to help.

01:20:29.507 --> 01:20:31.340
I'm the one who's trying
to find a cure.

01:20:31.342 --> 01:20:33.142
By turnin' our fuckin' vets
into lab rats?

01:20:33.144 --> 01:20:34.276
No, I...

01:20:34.278 --> 01:20:36.210
He knew it wasn't safe.

01:20:36.212 --> 01:20:38.246
You knew
about the side effects.

01:20:38.248 --> 01:20:40.249
What are you talking about?
What are you...

01:20:40.251 --> 01:20:42.318
I made it work. Alright?
I made...

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.520
You, you begged me for it,
Jake!

01:20:45.522 --> 01:20:48.357
<i>You didn't wanna wait
for the FDA.</i>

01:20:48.359 --> 01:20:51.260
<i>Anything to forget.
Anything to forget.</i>

01:20:51.262 --> 01:20:53.565
<i>Everything will be different
once it's finished.</i>

01:20:55.165 --> 01:20:57.366
Hey, hey...

01:20:57.368 --> 01:20:59.702
I'm helping people.
T-this is important.

01:20:59.704 --> 01:21:01.536
Do you not see
how important this is?

01:21:01.538 --> 01:21:03.037
I'm shutting this down.

01:21:03.039 --> 01:21:04.673
Alright, Jake? You alright?

01:21:04.675 --> 01:21:06.041
Don't do that.

01:21:06.043 --> 01:21:07.608
I'm calling the cops. Fuck you.

01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:10.045
Put the phone down.

01:21:10.047 --> 01:21:11.145
We were wrong.

01:21:11.147 --> 01:21:12.715
What are you talking about?

01:21:12.717 --> 01:21:14.616
You knew about the side effects!

01:21:14.618 --> 01:21:16.484
Put the fucking
phone down, man!

01:21:16.486 --> 01:21:17.618
Fuck you, you're done.

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:19.721
It doesn't erase the memories.

01:21:19.723 --> 01:21:22.291
It replaces them
with something worse.

01:21:22.293 --> 01:21:23.358
You're not calling the cops.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.559
Put the fucking phone down.

01:21:24.561 --> 01:21:27.462
- Fuck you!
- It's killing people.

01:21:27.464 --> 01:21:31.269
We... we shouldn't have done it.

01:21:38.542 --> 01:21:40.142
We weren't helping anyone.

01:21:40.144 --> 01:21:42.111
Put the fucking phone down!

01:21:42.113 --> 01:21:43.746
Put the fucking phone down!

01:21:43.748 --> 01:21:45.714
<i>Put the phone down!
I'm gonna shoot you.</i>

01:21:45.716 --> 01:21:49.318
Put the...
Put the fucking phone down!

01:21:51.555 --> 01:21:53.654
No, Jake, no! No! No!

01:22:02.199 --> 01:22:03.168
Jake!

01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:29.291
You're okay. I'm sorry.
