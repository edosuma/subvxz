WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:04.737
And while they are serving up
slices at Enzo's,

00:04.872 --> 00:06.271
Captain Penisi and I

00:06.273 --> 00:09.141
will be serving up slices
on the court.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.143
- Cut. What are you doing?
- I'm improvising.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.611
- You're supposed
to miss the ball.

00:12.747 --> 00:14.347
- I don't wanna miss the ball.
You miss the ball.

00:14.481 --> 00:15.748
- No, the script says you're
supposed to miss the ball

00:15.883 --> 00:17.482
and then throw your racket.
- I'm the chief.

00:17.484 --> 00:18.751
I gotta wear the stupid hat.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.019
You wear the hat.
You throw your racket.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.820
- Penisi, time is money.
Come on.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.623
- Terry, you're the food guy.
I'm the spokes-guy.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.491
When you improvise,
it messes up the flow.

00:26.493 --> 00:29.428
We're going again.
Take eight, and action.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.097
Enzo, throw the ball.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.832
And while Enzo
is serving up slices,

00:33.834 --> 00:37.102
Chief McConky and I will be
serving up slices on the court.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.170
- Hey, that's my line.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.772
You stole my line.
- Cut.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.974
Yeah, it didn't sound right
coming out of your mouth.

00:42.109 --> 00:43.175
The good news is,
I think we got it.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.777

00:56.591 --> 01:00.459

I'm a firefighter.

01:01.462 --> 01:06.666
- [spits]
- Ah. [laughs]

01:08.603 --> 01:09.602
Cut.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.270
That was great.
Let's do another one.

01:11.406 --> 01:13.272
How about this time,
I give Gina the Heimlich?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.741
- Absolutely.
- All right, here we go.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.142

It's way too mild.

it's pickleball week,

the appeal of pickleball?

the fastest-growing sport

lateral movement?

backward when you're a punter.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.498

of course.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.115

07:46.934 --> 07:49.001

How's that even possible?

07:49.136 --> 07:51.536

in the Luzon rain forest.

07:51.538 --> 07:55.074
They're fed to jaguars,
who digest and defecate them.

07:55.209 --> 07:57.342

fed to elephants,

07:57.344 --> 07:58.877
who also defecate them.

07:58.879 --> 08:02.215
Then they clean off the beans,
brew it, and voila.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.616
- Sounds delicious.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.618
I mean, until you explain
the whole process.

Ooh, baby, it smells.

08:08.022 --> 08:09.688
