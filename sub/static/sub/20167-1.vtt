00:30.797 --> 00:34.833
- I had the pleasure
of knowing Dorothy Ann

00:35.602 --> 00:37.169
for 40 years.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.075
She was a classmate, my friend,

00:45.745 --> 00:48.280
a member of our congregation,

00:49.082 --> 00:51.717
and even my nurse a few times.

00:53.586 --> 00:58.123
She was always dedicated to
whatever it was she was doing.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.859
Always found the good in people.

01:03.129 --> 01:07.199
She had more substance
than anyone I ever knew.

01:11.638 --> 01:16.075
She was a proud mother,
and a good one, too.

01:16.077 --> 01:19.445
And she will be
greatly missed by many.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.789
- I told you not to come
around here, did I not?

03:43.791 --> 03:45.290
- Listen, just let me
see him a little bit

03:45.292 --> 03:46.525
before I go, okay?

03:46.527 --> 03:47.726
- You do not get to
see him real quick

03:47.728 --> 03:49.061
when it's convenient
for you, Dayne.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.862
Baby, go back inside, please.

03:50.864 --> 03:55.267
Did you get my message
about the child support?

03:55.269 --> 03:58.036
- Yeah, I got your message,
and like I told you,

03:58.038 --> 03:59.238
if I don't have any money,
I can't send you any money.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.139
- I'm so sick of
your excuses, Dayne.

04:01.141 --> 04:03.041
Look, all I ask of you is
that you just help us out

04:03.043 --> 04:04.710
around here just a
little bit, but no,

04:04.712 --> 04:06.178
you can't even do that
'cause you're too busy

04:06.180 --> 04:07.613
drinking and smoking and...

04:07.615 --> 04:09.248
- no, that's bullshit,
okay, because I'm sober now

04:09.250 --> 04:12.251
and I quit smoking, so you
have to let me see him.

04:12.253 --> 04:15.854
- Two for 100, good
for you, Dayne.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.724
- Okay, hey, buddy, come say
hi to your daddy real quick.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.192
- Please stop making a scene
and just get out of here.

04:21.195 --> 04:22.728
- Hey, buddy, hi,

04:22.730 --> 04:25.130
- go back inside, please.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.199
- He's my son, I have
a right to see him.

04:27.201 --> 04:29.601
- No, you don't, you don't
have any rights around here,

04:29.603 --> 04:31.436
okay, I have full custody
and you can't even pay

04:31.438 --> 04:34.006
your goddamn child support.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.707
- This is bullshit.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.644
I'll see you when I
get back, okay, bud?

04:38.646 --> 04:39.878
- Okay.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.561
- I just don't think it's a
good idea for you to leave

04:56.563 --> 04:58.930
when you're up for a promotion.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.832
Our family needs this.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.202
Why are you ignoring me?

05:04.204 --> 05:06.471
- Look, I'm not, I just
don't want to argue

05:06.473 --> 05:08.106
about it, alright?

05:09.876 --> 05:13.545
- Why can't we leave
together in two months

05:13.547 --> 05:15.881
when the summer comes?

05:15.883 --> 05:18.116
We could go all
together as a family.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.418
- Amy, we've been over this.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.119
- No, we haven't.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.322
You basically made this
decision on your own,

05:23.324 --> 05:26.558
and you expect me
to be okay with it.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.752
Babes, I know what it is
like to lose a mother.

05:53.754 --> 05:58.090
But running from it, it's
not gonna help anything.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.725
- Honey, come on.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.527
- Steve, talk to
me, I am your wife.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.463
What do you feel guilty about?

06:04.465 --> 06:07.766
You've always been
there for her.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.835
- Not enough, I wasn't.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.219
- What's up, you little pirate?

06:27.221 --> 06:30.756
Come here, oh, a
little indoor baseball?

06:30.758 --> 06:33.358
- So what, you're just
gonna make me feel like this?

06:33.360 --> 06:35.460
With Dayne of all people?
- You wanna go outside?

06:35.462 --> 06:36.661
- Yeah, come on, let's
go toss it around.

06:36.663 --> 06:40.165
- Amy, he was basically
raised by her, too.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.245
- You can't use
that money, Steve.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.246
- We have plenty coming from her

06:54.248 --> 06:57.048
life insurance money, all right?

06:58.050 --> 07:01.253
She saved this for a
trip she can never take.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.721
This is for her.

07:09.962 --> 07:13.064
- I know you feel lost
right now, and I support you

07:13.066 --> 07:16.201
honoring your mother, I do,
I just wish you would just

07:16.203 --> 07:17.669
settle your emotions
- Amy.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.338
- Before you go, I
don't want anything

07:20.340 --> 07:22.374
to happen to you, okay?

07:23.409 --> 07:25.277
- I'll be fine, alright?

07:25.279 --> 07:27.412
Please, just understand.

07:30.950 --> 07:31.950
What?

07:51.037 --> 07:52.037
Hey.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.706
- Hey, Amy.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.008
- Hey, will you
load these for me?

07:57.010 --> 07:59.578
- Uh, yeah, we have a minute.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.413
- Thanks.

08:06.219 --> 08:09.187
Come on, babe, you
understand, right?

08:09.189 --> 08:10.889
We have to do this.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.793
- You know this hurts
for me, too, right?

08:14.795 --> 08:15.994
- Yeah.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.396
- It won't stop you though.

08:22.635 --> 08:23.702
- Love you.

08:30.476 --> 08:32.376
I'll miss you, buddy.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.414
You're the man of the house now.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.784
- Will you be back
for my birthday party?

08:39.785 --> 08:43.822
- Yeah, I won't miss it
for the world, alright?

08:59.906 --> 09:02.908
- He's gonna be back soon, okay?

09:13.252 --> 09:16.054
- Everything cool, brother?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.422
- I don't know.

09:18.925 --> 09:21.893
- Amy didn't seem
happy to see me.

09:22.962 --> 09:25.997
- She's not happy
right now, period.

10:11.545 --> 10:14.512
- you know, I don't
know, I just...

10:15.548 --> 10:18.316
I'm telling you, man,
it scarred me for life.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.985
The first time I get a pair
of girl's underwear off

10:19.987 --> 10:22.020
and it's got fucking
skid marks on it.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.188
- You would be scarred by that.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.689
- No, it's terrifying.

10:24.691 --> 10:27.492
I believe that girls don't poop.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.328
- Life's just a bunch
of impressions of people

10:30.330 --> 10:32.197
along the way, man.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.532
I remember this time my
grandfather, he'd always show me

10:34.534 --> 10:37.535
his little dice, and he would
say, "Steve, this little

10:37.537 --> 10:40.105
"person lives inside there."

10:40.107 --> 10:41.940
Every time I see a dice, I
think about this little person

10:41.942 --> 10:44.142
that lives inside there,
even though I know

10:44.144 --> 10:46.111
it's not true, you
know what I mean?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.746
Still to this day.

10:48.948 --> 10:50.649
Impressions.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.117
- I think I know what
you're saying, man.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.551
It's like when I was a little
kid and I still believed

10:53.553 --> 10:56.187
in Santa Claus, I went
and saw him when we were

10:56.189 --> 10:58.156
at the mall, and I'm
sitting on this dude's lap,

10:58.158 --> 11:00.325
and he's fucking Chinese.

11:01.627 --> 11:03.561
So I'm like, this, I don't
understand what's happening.

11:03.563 --> 11:06.464
This doesn't look
like all the pictures

11:06.466 --> 11:07.932
I've ever seen of Santa Claus.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.167
And so in my mind, I'm
like, fuck, I saw the real

11:09.169 --> 11:11.536
Santa Claus, all these
other people were wrong.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.871
Is anybody coming?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.339
- You're good, bro.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.074
- And I'm like, man, I
met the real motherfucker.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.476
So for like the next four
years, I was the weirdo

11:18.478 --> 11:21.146
that would dress up as a
ninja and like give people

11:21.148 --> 11:23.682
fortune cookies and Chinese
stars 'cause I thought

11:23.684 --> 11:25.717
that's what the real
Santa would like.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.253
So now every time I see
Santa Claus in anything,

11:28.255 --> 11:30.889
I'm like, I just think
of that Asian dude.

11:30.891 --> 11:34.592
- That's funny.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.401
So how's chance, man?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.603
You get a chance to see
him before you left?

11:45.605 --> 11:48.339
- Yeah, he's all
right, doing good.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.276
Lisa just don't let me see him
much, you know what I mean?

11:51.278 --> 11:53.645
Thinks I drink too much around
him and doesn't want him

11:53.647 --> 11:56.748
to grow up to take
after me, I guess.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.149
- That's rough.

11:59.418 --> 12:01.686
Seems like you're doing
a lot better, though.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.488
Aa not helping or what?

12:03.490 --> 12:05.557
- No way, you
know, I wanna drink

12:05.559 --> 12:08.226
the second I leave
that fucking building.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.862
It's ridiculous, man, they
need to take us out somewhere

12:10.864 --> 12:12.997
and let us do
something fun together.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.232
- What?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.901
Like an aa field
trip or something?

12:16.903 --> 12:18.770
- Shit, yeah, you
know what I mean?

12:18.772 --> 12:20.772
Instead of us sitting around
miserable the entire time,

12:20.774 --> 12:24.409
wanna blow our brains
out from fucking boredom,

12:24.411 --> 12:25.910
get us out doing something,

12:25.912 --> 12:29.714
learning in a new
environment, I don't know.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.017
- Man, you just need just
like a full-time job.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.686
I'll try to get you on
my job, you just gotta

12:34.688 --> 12:37.422
get up for the schooling, man.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.257
- I don't know, man.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.660
6am, that's fucking early, dude.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.163
I don't do too well in the
mornings, you know that.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.066
- Not everyone
could be like mom.

12:53.405 --> 12:55.473
She gave me everything.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.769
- Hey, lis, it's me.

13:24.771 --> 13:28.006
Um, just wanna call and
say sorry for earlier.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.774
Trying to get my shit
straightened out,

13:29.776 --> 13:31.810
but you gotta let me see chance.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.312
It's been like a month,
and before that it was like

13:34.314 --> 13:38.516
two months, and I gotta
be able to see my boy, so

13:40.286 --> 13:42.220
I guess just give me a
call when you get a sec,

13:42.222 --> 13:44.322
and let's talk it out.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.658
Maybe we can sit down
when I get back, okay?

13:46.660 --> 13:48.126
Alright, thanks.

13:54.633 --> 13:55.800
- Here's your change, sir.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.936
- Thank you.
- And have a good day.

13:57.938 --> 13:58.970
- You, too.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.276
You want me to drive?

14:07.746 --> 14:08.746
You tired?

14:09.782 --> 14:10.782
- Yeah.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.084
- Alright.

14:13.086 --> 14:17.188
You want me to stop in a few
hours, get a room?

14:17.990 --> 14:19.157
- Alright.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.459
- What are you doing still up?

15:04.270 --> 15:05.270
I love you.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.838
- I love you too.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.708
- He is out like a light.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.544
- I'm sure pops put him to
sleep with his old war stories.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.914
- Yeah well I
think he likes 'em.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.917
He just wishes pops could
throw the ball around with him.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.019
- I know, it's a shame.

15:21.021 --> 15:24.222
You know that's not
possible anymore.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.825
What your son needs
is his own father.

15:27.827 --> 15:31.562
- Yeah well, his
father needs a father.

15:31.564 --> 15:32.764
- Oh come on, Lisa.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.532
There must be something to him.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.902
I mean, he had enough charm
to get you, didn't he?

15:37.904 --> 15:40.305
- Biggest mistake of my life.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.240
- Please don't say that, Lisa.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.710
If it wasn't for that mistake,
we wouldn't have chance.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.745
- Mom, I'm not
talking about chance,

15:47.747 --> 15:49.180
I'm obviously
talking about Dayne.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.381
You don't even like him.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.818
You say what a deadbeat
he is all the time.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.653
- That's not what I say.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.055
I say I don't like
the way the two of you

15:57.057 --> 15:58.756
treat each other.

15:58.758 --> 16:02.260
Your son adores his father
and he needs him around.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.228
You and Dayne need
to work things out.

16:04.230 --> 16:09.000
- So now I'm responsible
for Dayne being a deadbeat?

16:09.002 --> 16:10.002
- Okay.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.871
You know what, honey?

16:13.873 --> 16:17.408
I'm gonna go tuck
your father in.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.177
I love you hon, goodnight.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.311
- Goodnight.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.758
- Here we go, mom.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.464
Ready?

16:43.469 --> 16:44.802
There he is, huh?

16:44.804 --> 16:49.107
- Stand there,
I'll get you by it.

16:49.908 --> 16:51.676
Gutzon Borglum.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.180
- Despite the rumors,
he was a decent guy.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.182
Wow.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.350
Holy shit.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.654
Mama Dee would have loved this.

17:03.656 --> 17:07.625
- I finally understand
her obsession about it.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.137
Love you, mom.

17:24.843 --> 17:29.147
- Stevie, this was one of
your father's favorite sights.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.985
He'd always tell me what
an amazing accomplishment

17:33.987 --> 17:38.423
it was for mankind to sculpt
the faces on a mountain

17:38.425 --> 17:40.324
in such great detail.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.229
Did you know that these
faces are scaled to a man

17:45.231 --> 17:47.865
who would stand 465 feet tall?

17:51.403 --> 17:54.372
And each head is
six stories high.

17:55.641 --> 17:58.609
Why, that's as
tall as the sphinx.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.549
And the great sculptor
Gutzon Borglum.

18:06.218 --> 18:10.521
That's Gutzon Borglum, well,
he started drilling in 1926

18:11.590 --> 18:13.825
when he was 60 years old.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.828
Can you imagine that?

18:16.830 --> 18:17.830
60!

18:20.099 --> 18:22.967
Took him 14 years
to complete it.

18:24.036 --> 18:27.472
You know, goodness, it
just goes to show you

18:29.475 --> 18:33.778
it's never too late to do
something amazing with your life.

18:35.314 --> 18:39.350
I just hope I get to see
it in person some day.

18:50.329 --> 18:54.632
- I wonder what the four fathers
think of the country now.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.462
- Hope you like roadkill
'cause that looks like

19:24.464 --> 19:25.930
what we got in here.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.533
- This is the only
place around here.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.868
It's nothing but freaking trees.

19:39.378 --> 19:40.478
- How you guys doing?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.680
You guys need a menu?

19:42.682 --> 19:43.714
There you go.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.083
Couple drinks started for you?

19:46.085 --> 19:47.952
- I'll have a water.

19:47.954 --> 19:51.889
- Let me get started with
chicken wings and a soda water.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.025
- You got it, how 'bout you?

19:54.027 --> 19:55.760
- I'm not sure yet.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.629
- What are you gonna get?

19:58.631 --> 20:00.031
- I'm not sure.

20:00.033 --> 20:00.831
- Thought you were starving,
you're being pretty

20:00.833 --> 20:01.766
fucking indecisive.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.167
- He's insecure.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.368
- What's that?

20:04.370 --> 20:06.003
- Fuck insecurity.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.974
Always happened
to have security.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.576
- Don't worry about
him, he does this

20:11.578 --> 20:12.777
from time to time.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.946
I just humor him,
let him do his thing.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.847
But I'll get on this.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.317
Fuck owing someone because
they do something for you.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.552
- Fuck care providers
that don't provide

20:21.554 --> 20:23.754
nothing but carelessness.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.992
- Alright, how 'bout this?

20:27.994 --> 20:30.461
Fuck fake ass motherfuckers.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.435
Fuck something, get in
on this, man, come on.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.436
- Are you serious?

20:38.438 --> 20:40.304
- Yeah.

20:40.306 --> 20:44.909
- Fuck it, fuck people who
judge you on how you dress.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.210
- Wah wah wah.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.513
That was a good try.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.717
How about fuck
power trip people.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.920
- They oughta take a trip of
their own, never come back.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.154
- God damn right.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.624
Fuck gas prices,
we're all on strike.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.225
- Fuck terrorists.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.393
- Alright.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.795
- Fuck the war on peace.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.998
Ain't nothing peaceful about it.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.232
- Damn right.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.868
World doesn't revolve
around you, sick fucks!

21:10.870 --> 21:12.270
- You know what?

21:12.272 --> 21:14.205
Fuck taxes, just fuck 'em.

21:14.207 --> 21:15.306
- We're on strike again.

21:15.308 --> 21:16.307
- Yeah.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.942
- Fuck crooked cops!

21:17.944 --> 21:20.311
- Fucking pigs.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.512
- Serve and protect my ass!

21:23.416 --> 21:24.382
- Whoa.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.817
- American dream is dead.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.954
What we need is a revolution.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.989
Revolution brings evolution,
without revolution

21:31.991 --> 21:36.594
humans do not evolve, people
need chaotic shit to happen.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.729
Make 'em see the
world differently.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.766
Give 'em a different
perspective.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.702
Otherwise they just
sit there stagnant.

21:44.704 --> 21:47.271
'60s and '70s had revolution.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.807
War.

21:51.810 --> 21:52.943
Drugs.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.445
Protesters.

21:54.447 --> 21:57.515
Those people evolved,
those people revolted.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.517
Us?

21:59.551 --> 22:02.687
We're too lazy to
open our mouth.

22:02.689 --> 22:06.390
Too absorbed with our
high tech devices.

22:06.392 --> 22:08.259
It's embarrassing
how oblivious we are

22:08.261 --> 22:11.495
to the bullshit
that's all around us.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.805
We're all blessed.

22:22.507 --> 22:26.711
It's what you do with your
blessings that counts.

22:27.479 --> 22:29.180
- Welcome to the bar, gentleman.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.181
That's Earl.

22:30.183 --> 22:33.050
- I like him, can we keep him?

22:33.052 --> 22:34.919
- You would keep him.

22:43.628 --> 22:44.795
- Hey buddy, oh.

22:44.797 --> 22:45.763
- Dude, get out,
come, Jesus, get out.

22:45.765 --> 22:46.764
- Christ, what died inside you?

22:46.766 --> 22:49.233
Fuck me, did you eat a goat?

22:50.001 --> 22:51.736
- Fucking chicken wings, man.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.871
- I ate 'em and that shit
ain't happening to me.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.172
- I don't know.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.674
- Yous got a weak little
baby stomach, don't ya?

22:56.676 --> 22:58.376
- Just shut the
fuck up and get out of here.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.377
- You want some pedialyte?

22:59.379 --> 23:00.611
- Shut the door.

23:00.613 --> 23:01.412
- You want me
to get you anything?

23:01.414 --> 23:02.880
- No, and no drinks.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.281
If you're sneaking off
to go get a fucking drink

23:04.283 --> 23:06.183
without me, don't do it.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.618
- Aye aye, captain.

23:07.620 --> 23:08.786
But seriously, call a
doctor, you need to get that

23:08.788 --> 23:09.887
checked out.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.522
- Just fucking go.

23:40.719 --> 23:41.719
- Call me.

23:47.293 --> 23:48.293
The fuck?

24:25.530 --> 24:27.231
- Dear
asshole, I just saved your ass

24:27.233 --> 24:28.933
after you smashed my bumper.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.601
Not sure why I'm helping you,

24:30.603 --> 24:32.069
maybe because I've been
where you're at before

24:32.071 --> 24:33.437
and I've kept my own.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.573
This is your one get
out of jail free card.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.408
Hope I don't regret this.

24:37.410 --> 24:38.943
Take care of yourself,
if not for you,

24:38.945 --> 24:40.811
then for your kids.

24:40.813 --> 24:44.281
Sincerely, one troubled
soul to another.

25:27.659 --> 25:29.460
- So still out here.

25:30.762 --> 25:32.229
- Yeah, 'cause all seven
people that live out here

25:32.231 --> 25:34.198
are too bored to move.

25:35.066 --> 25:37.067
- I think it's nice.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.536
- Nice and terrible.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.437
I guarantee you nothing
interesting has happened here

25:40.439 --> 25:44.141
since they outlawed
cousin fucking in 1912.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.712
- Oh man, you're crazy.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.982
- Why would you
choose to live here?

25:51.984 --> 25:54.184
- Greg doesn't
have a say so, man.

25:54.186 --> 25:57.388
Until he sells a screenplay,
Stacy's calling all the shots.

25:57.390 --> 26:01.125
Plus it's like nice people
place to sleep tonight.

26:01.127 --> 26:06.030
- What kind of idiot tries to
make a living writing movies?

26:06.032 --> 26:09.266
What do you mean,
sleep here tonight?

26:10.969 --> 26:13.137
I gotta fucking stay
out here overnight?

26:13.139 --> 26:14.772
- Dude, what is your
problem with Greg?

26:17.276 --> 26:19.076
Was that a gunshot?

26:32.824 --> 26:34.091
What do you got a gun for?

26:34.093 --> 26:35.093
Whoa whoa whoa!

26:36.295 --> 26:37.661
Oh my god, he's tripping out.

26:37.663 --> 26:38.862
Greg, Greg!

26:38.864 --> 26:40.397
Put the gun down!

26:40.399 --> 26:42.700
- Go go go, drive,
drive, fast, drive fast,

26:42.702 --> 26:45.235
fucker's gonna get me, just
fucking drive, just go!

26:45.237 --> 26:46.236
- Who's after you?

26:46.238 --> 26:47.237
- Oh shit!

26:47.239 --> 26:48.238
- Who's after you?

26:48.240 --> 26:49.373
- Faster man, faster!

26:49.375 --> 26:50.240
They not fucking
playing around, faster!

26:50.242 --> 26:51.709
Oh fucking shit!

26:52.711 --> 26:57.047
- I don't even see a
scarecrow, Jesus Christ.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.282
Greg.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.850
- They gonna take
me alive, drive.

26:59.852 --> 27:00.918
- Give me that
fucking rifle, man.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.720
- Cock pissing motherfuckers!

27:02.722 --> 27:04.254
Go get you, go get
you motherfuckers!

27:04.256 --> 27:05.456
You want it?

27:05.458 --> 27:06.790
Come get some,
come and get some!

27:08.060 --> 27:09.259
- There's nothing out there.

27:09.261 --> 27:10.060
- He's got a gun, Dayne.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.629
Greg, no no no no!

27:13.965 --> 27:15.766
Greg, gimme the gun!

27:17.936 --> 27:20.437
There's nothing in there!

27:20.439 --> 27:22.439
- Ooh, they're fucking
sneaky little fuckers.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.008
- Give me the gun, Greg, man,

27:24.010 --> 27:25.275
who is it, who?

27:25.277 --> 27:27.645
Greg, where's Stacy?

27:27.647 --> 27:28.647
Greg!

27:29.514 --> 27:31.682
Greg, where's Stacy?

27:31.684 --> 27:32.683
- Who?

27:32.685 --> 27:35.019
- Your wife, Stacy your wife.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.387
- Oh shit, Stacy.

27:36.389 --> 27:37.655
- Yeah, where she at?

27:37.657 --> 27:40.691
- Oh god, what would the
dragons want with Stacy?

27:40.693 --> 27:43.293
Oh fuck, the dragons got Stacy!

27:43.295 --> 27:44.294
Stacy!

27:44.296 --> 27:47.031
Oh fuck Stacy, I'm sorry Stacy!

27:48.767 --> 27:50.567
- Are you fucking kidding me?

27:54.606 --> 27:56.006
- Greg.

28:02.947 --> 28:05.482
- You sure you killed them?

28:05.484 --> 28:07.951
- Yeah bud, we got them all.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.856
- All the who?

28:12.858 --> 28:16.727
- Yeah Greg, we slew the
dragons, all of them.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.862
Dragons are dead as shit.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.298
- Oh friend, I knew
you weren't a demon.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.601
I'm so happy right now.

28:28.006 --> 28:29.239
You see that?

28:29.974 --> 28:32.076
All the colors have come back.

28:33.879 --> 28:37.347
Oh, this is gonna be
an amazing evening.

28:42.053 --> 28:45.022
- Might wanna keep this on you.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.757
How long does this
stuff take to wear off?

28:46.759 --> 28:48.892
- How the fuck should I know?

28:48.894 --> 28:50.394
'Cause I done a couple
drugs in my day?

28:50.396 --> 28:51.695
I've obviously never done
what fucking Chiquita banana

28:51.697 --> 28:53.764
is on over there.

28:53.766 --> 28:56.266
- Oh, it's gonna be
an amazing evening.

29:00.338 --> 29:01.705
You miss me too?

29:13.885 --> 29:16.086
When is she coming back?

29:16.088 --> 29:17.721
I miss her, Steve.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.090
Oh my god, why?

29:23.161 --> 29:24.862
- I can't, I can't.

29:28.199 --> 29:29.399
- Look, Greg.

29:30.735 --> 29:32.870
- I miss her, Steve,
I miss her so much.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.738
- I'll be right back.

29:35.774 --> 29:36.940
- Steve.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.275
- It's okay, it's okay.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.276
- Don't leave me.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.345
- It's okay, it's okay.

31:04.662 --> 31:07.364
- Oh my god, that's
fucking right.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.766
New York pizza's the best, man.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.034
I would cut off your left arm

31:11.036 --> 31:12.469
to be able to eat
this every night.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.004
- Yeah, thanks buddy.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.306
It's really good but we
were starving so it's like

31:16.308 --> 31:19.543
being stoned, everything's
better when you're stoned.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.578
- Don't try to get
scientific with me.

31:21.580 --> 31:24.214
Hey hey hey like being stoned.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.918
Oh my god, I'm in
love, give me another.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.153
- Dude, you're a pig,
it's your fourth one.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.688
We're on a tight budget, man.

31:31.690 --> 31:32.823
- Like I said.

31:38.296 --> 31:39.863
I'll sing the entire fucking
song in this restaurant

31:39.865 --> 31:41.832
unless you get me more pizza.

31:41.834 --> 31:43.367
- Go ahead, make
an ass of yourself.

31:43.369 --> 31:44.568
- You know that's
what I'm best at.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.569
- I'm used to it.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.570
- Really?

31:46.572 --> 31:47.571
You ready for this?

31:47.573 --> 31:48.572
- Sorry.

31:48.574 --> 31:49.574
I'm warning you.

31:50.576 --> 31:51.575
- Ladies and gentlemen.

31:51.577 --> 31:52.876
- I'm serious.

31:52.878 --> 31:53.710
- No, well, you fucked
yourself on this one.

31:53.712 --> 31:54.712
- Just another day.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.718
Thank you New York City!

32:01.720 --> 32:03.353
- Woo, sing it!

32:05.324 --> 32:06.890
- Thank you, thank
you very much.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.358
- You're a madman.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.460
- Yeah, I am, luckily,
somebody here likes crazy.

32:10.462 --> 32:11.462
Wah wah.

32:12.597 --> 32:13.864
- Oh, here we go.

32:13.866 --> 32:15.332
- Yeah, it's on.

32:17.268 --> 32:18.268
- Clayne.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.336
- Nope, too late.

32:19.338 --> 32:20.938
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.139
How are we this evening?

32:22.141 --> 32:23.640
- Hello there.

32:23.642 --> 32:26.310
- Hello, how was
the show, did you enjoy it?

32:26.312 --> 32:27.844
- Never seen one
like that before.

32:27.846 --> 32:29.346
- Well, that's what
I was looking for,

32:29.348 --> 32:31.014
you know what I mean, and
I know this is awkward

32:31.016 --> 32:33.917
but tickets are $10, you
can either pay me directly,

32:33.919 --> 32:36.486
can buy me and my handsome
gentleman friend over there

32:36.488 --> 32:40.290
some drinks down the
street, or you can just

32:41.292 --> 32:42.225
stuff it right
down my waistband.

32:42.227 --> 32:43.160
- Dinner and a strip show.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.494
- I aim to please, ladies.

32:44.496 --> 32:45.862
You know what I mean?

32:45.864 --> 32:47.531
So, you guys decide
your method of payment

32:47.533 --> 32:50.667
and we can retire
to a bar or my RV.

32:53.004 --> 32:54.838
Oh god, I sound like a fucking
serial killer, don't I?

32:54.840 --> 32:55.973
- A little bit.

32:55.975 --> 32:56.940
- Little too strong?

32:56.942 --> 32:58.442
- Little bit, yeah.

32:58.444 --> 32:59.409
- I didn't mean RV, I meant
Ritz Carlton on wheels,

32:59.411 --> 33:00.911
which is more appropriate.

33:00.913 --> 33:02.713
- Oh wow, I never heard of
that before in New York.

33:02.715 --> 33:04.247
- Yeah well I mean
it's this new thing,

33:04.249 --> 33:05.849
I think Donald trump started
it, it's really high class.

33:05.851 --> 33:06.850
- Where you from?

33:06.852 --> 33:07.851
- Washington state.

33:07.853 --> 33:08.919
- Oh nice.

33:08.921 --> 33:10.287
- You know what I mean?

33:10.289 --> 33:12.723
Whoa!

33:12.725 --> 33:14.157
Baby hawk doesn't
like being touched,

33:14.159 --> 33:16.593
you gotta warm up
to baby hawk, okay?

33:16.595 --> 33:17.594
- You look crazy, you know?

33:17.596 --> 33:18.829
- Whoa.

33:18.831 --> 33:19.629
- A little crazy,
I'm a lot crazy.

33:19.631 --> 33:20.831
- I can't touch it?

33:20.833 --> 33:21.631
- Oh, you can touch
it all you want.

33:21.633 --> 33:22.833
- Oh there you go.

33:22.835 --> 33:24.195
- There you go,
you just gotta ask.

33:24.636 --> 33:25.635
- Feels good, feels good.

33:25.637 --> 33:26.770
- It does feel good.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.238
Lots of people should touch it.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.439
So, I guess that's all
we need to say, isn't it?

33:29.441 --> 33:31.508
Meet you girls out front
about five minutes?

33:31.510 --> 33:32.509
- How cocky.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.977
- Sounds good.

33:33.979 --> 33:35.278
Baby hawk doesn't
know any better,

33:35.280 --> 33:36.947
he just does what he does.

33:36.949 --> 33:38.482
- Baby hawk, hmm.

33:44.255 --> 33:47.958
- I don't know, sometimes
it's too easy, buddy.

33:47.960 --> 33:48.992
Got a gift.

33:48.994 --> 33:50.293
- What, what's happening?

33:50.295 --> 33:51.795
- Well I'm pretty sure
we're gonna hang out

33:51.797 --> 33:53.663
with those girls, have a few
drinks, maybe do a little

33:53.665 --> 33:55.232
dancing, I don't know.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.500
- Seriously man?

33:56.502 --> 33:57.502
It's late.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.437
- Alright dude, what's
the fucking problem?

34:00.439 --> 34:02.339
- First of all you're
supposed to stay sober.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.674
Second of all I'm married,
I know it's not a big deal

34:04.676 --> 34:08.078
to you but technically,
so are you man.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.983
- Technically we're separated
and I live in my fucking RV.

34:12.985 --> 34:15.485
And is that really how
you wanna come at me?

34:15.487 --> 34:17.020
Okay, Lisa doesn't
want to be with me,

34:17.022 --> 34:19.889
what the fuck am I supposed
to do, sit at home and cry?

34:19.891 --> 34:22.426
Why wouldn't I hang out
with these beautiful women?

34:22.428 --> 34:26.029
- Exactly why she doesn't
want to be with you, man.

34:26.031 --> 34:28.264
Look, I didn't mean
it that way, alright?

34:28.266 --> 34:31.268
I'm just looking out for
you, you need to chill out.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.070
Just call it a night, man.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.806
It's been a long ride already.

34:35.808 --> 34:38.175
- Look, I know where you're
coming from and I appreciate it.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.842
But I'm a grown ass man and
I don't need you lecturing me

34:39.844 --> 34:42.344
and I don't need someone
looking out for me.

34:42.347 --> 34:43.847
- I got it.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.181
- Yeah, so if I wanna go
have some drinks with some

34:45.184 --> 34:47.350
beautiful women and
enjoy New York City,

34:47.351 --> 34:49.052
I'm gonna do that.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.620
Okay?

34:50.621 --> 34:53.456
But I'm not doing it alone, I
need you there with me, man,

34:53.458 --> 34:55.592
that's the reason for this trip.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.260
Fucking let loose for one
night, man, do some harmless

34:57.262 --> 34:59.463
flirting, have one drink.

35:00.698 --> 35:03.733
Nothing shady, man, this
is all innocent stuff.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.969
Just come out with
me for one beer.

35:05.971 --> 35:06.971
Please.

35:10.641 --> 35:11.842
There he is.

35:11.844 --> 35:12.876
- One beer.

35:14.345 --> 35:16.680
Seriously, one beer.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.281
- One beer.

35:51.483 --> 35:55.619
- hey, I bought all
my shirts at baby gap.

35:59.690 --> 36:01.625
She doesn't believe I got
a live beaver in there.

36:01.627 --> 36:03.126
- Oh, live beaver.

36:13.237 --> 36:14.804
- We got a unfinished game
of Pokemon we gotta settle up

36:14.806 --> 36:16.239
so if y'all could give
us a little space.

36:16.241 --> 36:18.542
- Dude, it's cold out man.

36:18.544 --> 36:22.145
- Okay, well good luck
getting into the room.

36:22.147 --> 36:23.813
- Yeah, we got a room.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.715
It's right over here.

36:32.224 --> 36:33.056
- Sit your ass down
there, I wanna see those,

36:33.058 --> 36:34.057
get that shirt off.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.058
- You take that shirt off.

36:35.060 --> 36:37.427
- I'm not scared, come on!

36:37.429 --> 36:38.562
- Come on, you first, do it!

36:38.564 --> 36:40.363
- Go, alright, get it off!

36:40.365 --> 36:41.765
Oh, you're about to get it.

36:41.767 --> 36:42.766
- Oh yeah.

36:42.768 --> 36:43.767
- Yeah?

36:43.769 --> 36:44.769
- Come on daddy.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.109
- So.

36:53.111 --> 36:54.111
- So.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.681
That's funny.

36:59.617 --> 37:04.487
Sorry about Dayne, you
know, he can be a handful.

37:04.489 --> 37:07.057
- Oh, no, so can Jess.

37:07.059 --> 37:08.725
But it doesn't mean that
we can't have a little bit

37:08.727 --> 37:09.727
more fun.

37:13.497 --> 37:16.466
- What do you mean?

37:16.468 --> 37:19.236
- I was thinking maybe
we could be a little more

37:19.238 --> 37:20.370
adventurous.

37:23.207 --> 37:24.207
- Like what?

37:24.209 --> 37:26.443
What do you have in mind?

37:27.812 --> 37:29.179
You look happy.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.782
What is that, weed?

37:33.818 --> 37:36.052
Wow, already packed.

37:36.054 --> 37:39.856
Guess that's how you
do it in New York, huh?

37:43.561 --> 37:44.861
- Come on.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.831
You don't break
the rules, at all?

37:48.699 --> 37:50.200
Just this once?

37:50.202 --> 37:53.703
Come on, you are on a road trip.

37:53.705 --> 37:54.704
- Yeah.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.506
- Take the edge off.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.579
- For old time's sake.

38:02.581 --> 38:03.581
- Cheers.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.116
- Oh fuck!

38:06.884 --> 38:08.018
That's good.

38:09.153 --> 38:10.954
That's good.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.922
That's fucking good.

38:12.924 --> 38:17.227
Oh god yeah you could win
some fucking awards for that.

38:21.932 --> 38:25.635
- You should come
and sit over here.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.338
I like to smoke and cuddle.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.073
- I don't know, I'm
already breaking one rule,

38:30.075 --> 38:31.141
I don't wanna.

38:33.178 --> 38:35.045
- Come on, come sit over here.

38:35.047 --> 38:37.747
- That ain't happening.

38:37.749 --> 38:40.917
- Okay, I'm gonna
come over there then.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.052
- Okay, wow.

38:45.122 --> 38:47.257
That's one way to do it.

38:51.896 --> 38:52.896
Uh oh.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.033
Getting cozy?

38:57.035 --> 38:58.234
- Mm hmm.

38:58.236 --> 39:00.170
Why don't you take
this, is this flannel?

39:00.172 --> 39:01.905
Why don't you take
this flannel off?

39:01.907 --> 39:03.039
- What, you don't
like the flannel?

39:03.041 --> 39:04.841
- It's very nirvana.

39:07.511 --> 39:08.511
- Good.

39:10.114 --> 39:12.315
- Why are you so nervous?

39:14.151 --> 39:15.919
- I don't know.

39:15.921 --> 39:16.921
- Don't be.

39:18.055 --> 39:21.424
You know, we're two
adults, conversing.

39:21.426 --> 39:22.425
- Yeah.

39:22.427 --> 39:23.660
- And relaxing.

39:23.662 --> 39:26.463
- Stoned in a bed
in a hotel room.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.199
- Steve.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.668
You're a nice guy.

39:32.703 --> 39:36.473
Your mother is looking
down at you smiling.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.942
- I hope not at this moment.

39:41.178 --> 39:43.146
- What about your dad?

39:48.619 --> 39:52.255
You don't like to talk
about him much, do you?

39:52.257 --> 39:53.490
- Not really.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.528
Didn't really know him.

39:58.530 --> 39:59.729
Truck driver.

40:04.068 --> 40:07.704
He was gone 12 weeks
at a time, just gone.

40:09.907 --> 40:14.244
She used to work at the
hospital and come home

40:14.246 --> 40:18.548
and have to take care of me
and Dayne after a while.

40:19.550 --> 40:20.784
I don't know.

40:21.552 --> 40:22.786
She got sick.

40:26.657 --> 40:27.791
That was it.

40:29.160 --> 40:33.296
- That's really sweet
what you're doing for her.

40:34.598 --> 40:38.868
- It's the first thing I
ever did good for my mom.

40:42.973 --> 40:44.007
Look, look.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.048
Look, you're a beautiful girl.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.350
Seriously, you're
gorgeous, alright?

40:54.352 --> 40:56.219
Any man would be
lucky to have you.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.688
I just, I can't be that guy.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.693
- Nah, it's okay.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.328
Just got caught
up in the moment.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.397
- Yeah, me too.

41:08.799 --> 41:09.933
It was nice.

41:10.935 --> 41:13.570
- This isn't gonna
happen, is it?

41:13.572 --> 41:14.871
- Not without me
feeling any more guilty

41:14.873 --> 41:16.639
than I already do.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.008
Alright, I'm gonna
check on them.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.010
Here, it's getting late.

41:21.012 --> 41:22.712
- Thank you.

41:26.550 --> 41:27.951
- Take it easy.

41:29.587 --> 41:32.121
- Yeah, was very therapeutic.

41:34.892 --> 41:37.694
- You have a safe journey.

41:37.696 --> 41:39.496
- We will, I'll try.

41:40.564 --> 41:41.698
- Good talk.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.200
- Come on.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.375
- Let's go.

41:52.377 --> 41:54.043
- Anything you wanna tell me?

41:54.045 --> 41:55.111
- What do you mean?

41:55.113 --> 41:56.212
- Oh, what do you mean?

41:56.214 --> 41:57.213
- Dude, nothing happened.

41:57.215 --> 41:58.481
- Okay.

41:58.483 --> 42:00.250
What about that giant
bulge in your pants.

42:00.252 --> 42:01.718
- Shut up, fucker.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.919
- Yeah, it's not very big.

42:02.921 --> 42:06.256
No, no, you don't
know where I've been!

42:43.661 --> 42:45.595
- Dude said it's
not gonna happen.

42:45.597 --> 42:47.697
Island's closed
for another week.

42:47.699 --> 42:49.499
- You gotta be kidding me.

42:49.501 --> 42:51.167
- Why don't we just do it here?

42:51.169 --> 42:53.937
I mean, we're pretty close,
the water's nice and calm.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.505
It's a good spot.

42:55.507 --> 42:58.241
- I wanted to take her
inside the statue, man.

42:58.243 --> 43:01.377
Not right here, not
across the river.

43:03.147 --> 43:04.714
- This is great.

43:04.716 --> 43:07.617
Come on man, this
is really nice.

43:13.490 --> 43:17.260
- This statue took the
whole world to build.

43:17.262 --> 43:21.864
The sculptor Fredrick
Auguste Bartoli designed it

43:21.866 --> 43:24.867
along with the same man who
designed the Eiffel Tower,

43:24.869 --> 43:27.003
Alexandre Gustav Eiffel.

43:28.305 --> 43:30.440
It was a joint effort between
the French and the American

43:30.442 --> 43:33.576
people, the French were
gonna build the statue

43:33.578 --> 43:37.714
while the Americans were
gonna build the pedestal.

43:37.716 --> 43:42.185
Now at that time, money was
very rough for both countries,

43:42.187 --> 43:46.222
so the French collected
public fees for the work,

43:46.224 --> 43:51.060
and the Americans, well,
we held theatrical events,

43:51.062 --> 43:54.831
art shows, auctions,
even prize fighting,

43:54.833 --> 43:59.135
to make enough money to have
the statue made and delivered.

44:00.437 --> 44:04.107
And when people weren't
helping, well, Joseph Pulitzer

44:04.109 --> 44:07.844
of the Pulitzer prize fame,
well, he used his newspaper

44:07.846 --> 44:11.581
to call out the greedy
to raise more money.

44:12.716 --> 44:16.452
Your father, he always
used to say that the

44:18.789 --> 44:22.625
statue of Liberty was a
true symbol of the world

44:22.627 --> 44:24.093
coming together.

44:30.134 --> 44:31.267
- What's up?

44:35.606 --> 44:37.073
- I just remember a time
when she was talking

44:37.075 --> 44:40.576
so passionately about the
statue and I just blew her off.

44:44.381 --> 44:47.617
- Well, we're here
now, honoring her.

44:49.086 --> 44:51.988
- A little late to
show our appreciation.

44:51.990 --> 44:55.158
- Why are you so hard on
yourself about this, okay?

44:55.160 --> 44:58.294
You were just a little kid,
what the fuck did you know?

44:58.296 --> 45:02.532
- Is that supposed to make
me feel better about it?

45:04.201 --> 45:06.035
- Alright, think
about it this way.

45:06.037 --> 45:09.205
When you think about curt,
what do you think of?

45:09.207 --> 45:10.940
You think about all the
times he's fucked up,

45:10.942 --> 45:13.609
or gotten in trouble,
or talked back to you?

45:13.611 --> 45:16.312
No man, you think about how
fucking happy it makes you

45:16.314 --> 45:18.381
to see his face every
morning and every night.

45:18.383 --> 45:20.850
That's what sticks with you.

45:22.119 --> 45:24.587
I guarantee you it was
the same way for Dorothy.

45:24.589 --> 45:27.557
- Says the so-called
deadbeat dad.

45:28.992 --> 45:30.860
- Alright you wanna play
around, keep the gloves up,

45:30.862 --> 45:33.463
keep 'em high, keep 'em
high, keep 'em high.

45:33.465 --> 45:34.497
- Just playing, alright?

45:34.499 --> 45:35.498
Seriously, sorry.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.499
- Alright.

45:36.501 --> 45:37.501
- Alright.

45:38.669 --> 45:40.536
This will have to do.

45:41.405 --> 45:42.505
Good enough?

45:42.507 --> 45:43.506
- This is good.

45:43.508 --> 45:44.741
This is nice.

46:04.962 --> 46:06.696
- Here you go, mom.

46:18.609 --> 46:20.243
Alright, let's go.

47:03.921 --> 47:05.321
- Your call has been forwarded

47:05.323 --> 47:08.257
to an automatic voice
message system.

47:08.259 --> 47:09.659
- Really?

47:09.661 --> 47:10.893
All the way across the
country and you can't pick up

47:10.895 --> 47:13.696
and let me talk to my
own son, not even once?

47:13.698 --> 47:15.364
I don't care if you got some
fucking dude over there,

47:15.366 --> 47:17.300
just pick up the goddamn phone.

47:17.302 --> 47:18.302
Bitch.

47:42.460 --> 47:44.026
- First of all, I'm at work,
but I guess you didn't think

47:44.028 --> 47:45.828
about now that did you, dipshit?

47:45.830 --> 47:47.597
And second of all, I'm a bitch?

47:47.599 --> 47:50.266
I'm a bitch for falling in
love with a childish asshole

47:50.268 --> 47:52.335
who acts the exact same
way he did when he was

47:52.337 --> 47:53.436
18 years old.

47:53.438 --> 47:54.937
You know what Dayne?

47:54.939 --> 47:56.172
You can't even hold
down a fucking job.

47:56.174 --> 47:57.640
You fuck everything
that walks, okay?

47:57.642 --> 47:59.442
And you're drunk more
than half the time.

47:59.444 --> 48:01.277
So don't you dare call me
or try and see your son

48:01.279 --> 48:03.379
until you can prove
to be a real father.

48:03.381 --> 48:04.847
You know I'm not even
going to acknowledge

48:04.849 --> 48:06.649
that stupid fucking comment
about another dude being

48:06.651 --> 48:07.750
over here.

48:07.752 --> 48:09.318
Grow the fuck up.

48:10.988 --> 48:11.988
Asshole.

48:21.632 --> 48:25.768
- Grab me something, I'll
be out front, alright?

48:32.009 --> 48:33.910
- Nice Mohawk, bitch.

48:35.112 --> 48:36.612
- Why don't you suck
my dick, motherfucker?

48:36.614 --> 48:38.080
- Ooh.

48:38.082 --> 48:39.248
- Oh yeah you like
that, don't you?

48:39.250 --> 48:40.616
- Tough guy, huh?

48:40.618 --> 48:41.851
- Come find out.

48:41.853 --> 48:43.352
- With your big
tough guy haircut.

48:43.354 --> 48:44.921
What you compensating for
with that haircut, man?

48:44.923 --> 48:46.923
- It's gotta counterweight
my big dick, bitch.

48:46.925 --> 48:49.425
- All you say is dicks, man.

48:49.427 --> 48:51.193
- Man, put your bitch on a
leash before she gets hurt.

48:51.195 --> 48:52.628
- Man, don't even
worry about him,

48:52.630 --> 48:54.163
this is between me and
you, don't worry about him.

48:54.165 --> 48:55.164
- I'm not worried.

48:55.166 --> 48:56.165
- You look worried.

48:56.167 --> 48:58.901
Gonna come down off that porch?

49:00.737 --> 49:01.570
- Is that all for you?

49:01.572 --> 49:03.005
- Yeah.

49:03.007 --> 49:05.841
- Tough guy haircut,
torn jeans, muscle shirt.

49:05.843 --> 49:07.977
Ain't gonna save you
from a ass beating.

49:07.979 --> 49:09.045
- Oh yeah?
- Bitch!

49:13.784 --> 49:14.850
- Oh, shit.

49:18.288 --> 49:20.756
- Hey, what's going on?

49:20.758 --> 49:21.757
- Glad you showed up.

49:21.759 --> 49:23.392
We were just talking about you.

49:23.394 --> 49:24.827
- Really, 'cause I was
born during the day

49:24.829 --> 49:26.128
but it wasn't yesterday
so why don't you tell me

49:26.130 --> 49:27.496
what's really going on?

49:27.498 --> 49:28.464
- Just...

49:28.466 --> 49:29.665
- y'all got beef?

49:29.667 --> 49:30.666
- Nope.

49:30.668 --> 49:31.667
- No.

49:31.669 --> 49:32.935
- I don't even know this dude.

49:32.937 --> 49:33.669
- Alright, okay, all
y'all's ids please.

49:33.671 --> 49:34.671
Ids.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.606
ID, yeah, great.

49:37.608 --> 49:39.642
Let me get your ID.

49:39.644 --> 49:42.211
- Thank you, appreciate it.

49:42.213 --> 49:43.212
ID?

49:43.214 --> 49:45.014
Give me your ID sir.

49:46.316 --> 49:47.516
- If you wanted my phone
number you could just ask.

49:47.518 --> 49:49.251
- Oh man, I'm busted,
how did you know?

49:49.253 --> 49:50.252
- I can tell.

49:50.254 --> 49:51.320
- You're just my type.

49:51.322 --> 49:52.888
Hey, out of state?

49:52.890 --> 49:54.123
- Yep.

49:54.125 --> 49:55.191
- What are y'all
doing around here?

49:55.193 --> 49:56.392
- Long story.

49:56.394 --> 49:58.828
- Well why don't
you entertain me?

49:58.830 --> 50:02.965
- Well actually his mom
died and we're spreading

50:03.700 --> 50:05.167
her ashes.

50:05.169 --> 50:06.969
- Okay, alright, do me a favor?

50:06.971 --> 50:08.004
- Bitch.

50:08.006 --> 50:09.238
- Stop talking.

50:09.240 --> 50:10.740
Y'all step away from
each other please.

50:10.742 --> 50:12.908
Alright, for your safety
and mine I need all of you

50:12.910 --> 50:14.343
to remain where you are.

50:14.345 --> 50:17.313
I'll be right back
with you, okay?

50:18.382 --> 50:19.482
- You believe this
fucking guy, dude?

50:19.484 --> 50:20.316
- Clayne.
- What?

50:20.318 --> 50:21.784
- What the fuck?

50:24.621 --> 50:27.323
- Alright, tell me why
you're really here again?

50:27.325 --> 50:28.324
- Exactly what he said.

50:28.326 --> 50:29.325
- Exactly what he said?

50:29.327 --> 50:30.326
What was that you said?

50:30.328 --> 50:31.827
- Spreading his mother's ashes.

50:31.829 --> 50:33.062
- Alright, do me a favor, put
your hands behind your back.

50:33.064 --> 50:35.131
What's the deal with
failure to appear

50:35.133 --> 50:36.799
on a suspended license?

50:36.801 --> 50:37.867
- Slipped my mind.

50:37.869 --> 50:39.135
- Slipped your mind?

50:39.137 --> 50:39.935
So you knew you had
a warrant on file?

50:39.937 --> 50:41.537
- Somewhat.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.672
- Come on, do me a favor,
step away from the car, sir.

50:43.674 --> 50:45.107
- Sweet tits, let's just
get in the back of the car.

50:45.109 --> 50:46.609
- Excuse me?

50:46.611 --> 50:48.778
You wanna play like that,
we can play like that.

50:48.780 --> 50:49.912
- Clayne, please
don't make it worse.

50:49.914 --> 50:51.180
- That's cool.

50:51.182 --> 50:53.349
Yeah, come on, stand
up, hold up, hold up.

50:53.351 --> 50:54.650
Nothing sharp?

50:57.287 --> 50:59.321
Alright, come on.

50:59.323 --> 51:01.624
- Excuse me, officer,
is this really necessary?

51:01.626 --> 51:03.692
- Yes sir, do me a favor,
don't be walking up on me,

51:03.694 --> 51:07.396
step back, appreciate
it, thank you.

51:07.398 --> 51:09.398
Go ahead, get in the car.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.133
Watch your head.

51:11.135 --> 51:12.168
Scoot back.

51:13.070 --> 51:14.070
Alright.

51:15.072 --> 51:16.172
- Can you tell me why
he's being arrested?

51:16.174 --> 51:17.173
- Yep.

51:17.175 --> 51:18.174
He's got warrants.

51:18.176 --> 51:19.375
- For what?

51:19.377 --> 51:22.278
- Failure to appear for
a suspended license.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.245
- You have to
arrest him for that?

51:23.247 --> 51:24.280
We're on a road trip.

51:24.282 --> 51:25.247
- Yeah fuck you motherfucker!

51:25.249 --> 51:26.282
- Hey, be quiet please.

51:26.284 --> 51:27.983
I don't have a choice.

51:27.985 --> 51:29.919
The problem is it's Friday
night and that means

51:29.921 --> 51:31.887
there's no magistrate which
means he's gonna have to

51:31.889 --> 51:34.190
go in front of a judge
on Monday morning.

51:34.192 --> 51:35.224
Alright, good luck to you.

51:35.226 --> 51:36.225
Thank you, appreciate it.

51:36.227 --> 51:37.226
- Please, I can't.

51:37.228 --> 51:39.095
This is unbelievable.

51:49.673 --> 51:51.073
- Hello?

51:51.075 --> 51:52.241
- Hi babe.

51:52.243 --> 51:53.243
- Hi.

51:55.245 --> 51:56.879
Where you guys at now?

51:56.881 --> 52:00.416
- We're somewhere in
Philly, Dlayne's in jail.

52:00.418 --> 52:02.151
- What?

52:02.153 --> 52:03.285
Why?

52:03.287 --> 52:06.021
- Amy, please,
please, I don't know,

52:06.023 --> 52:09.492
he had some warrants out
or something and driving

52:09.494 --> 52:11.594
with a suspended license,
who the fuck knows with him?

52:11.596 --> 52:13.996
- I knew, I knew this
trip was a bad idea,

52:13.998 --> 52:15.865
especially with Dayne.

52:15.867 --> 52:18.000
- Amy, please don't
lecture me right now.

52:18.002 --> 52:19.835
I am just calling to
say hi, wanted to have

52:19.837 --> 52:22.271
a peaceful conversation,
just keep you updated.

52:22.273 --> 52:23.739
- Well thanks
for the daily update

52:23.741 --> 52:26.308
of how much of a fuck up
your best friend is, Steve.

52:26.310 --> 52:28.110
Real newsflash there!

52:28.112 --> 52:30.179
- Amy, please, alright?

52:31.548 --> 52:35.451
God, I'm tired, can I just have
a little support right now?

52:35.453 --> 52:36.685
Please?

52:36.687 --> 52:38.420
- Yeah, it would be
nice, wouldn't it?

52:38.422 --> 52:40.289
How do you think I feel, Steve?

52:40.291 --> 52:42.858
I loved your mom too.

52:42.860 --> 52:47.329
But you left me dealing
with this all on my own.

52:47.331 --> 52:49.899
Curt's just a child,
Steve, he doesn't even

52:49.901 --> 52:53.335
understand that his
grandmother just passed away.

52:53.337 --> 52:57.173
You need to be home
with your family.

52:57.175 --> 52:59.141
- You're acting like I
abandoned my family, Amy.

52:59.143 --> 53:00.609
I didn't.

53:00.611 --> 53:04.713
Look, I'm honoring my mother
the only way I know how.

53:04.715 --> 53:06.282
You don't get it.

53:07.517 --> 53:11.554
I didn't show her appreciation
at all her whole life.

53:18.562 --> 53:22.598
I can't see her again,
Amy, you understand that?

53:22.600 --> 53:25.334
I can't ever talk to her again.

53:27.571 --> 53:29.371
- I'm so sorry baby.

53:31.641 --> 53:34.610
I just want you
here home with us.

53:36.012 --> 53:38.180
Can you just please skip
the rest of the monuments

53:38.182 --> 53:39.481
and come home?

53:40.984 --> 53:45.020
- I love you and curt so
much, I miss you guys.

53:46.089 --> 53:49.491
I just have to do this,
please understand that.

53:49.493 --> 53:53.796
I can't explain it, it's
just something I have to do.

53:55.799 --> 53:57.433
I'll call you soon, alright?

53:57.435 --> 53:58.634
I love you.

53:58.636 --> 54:00.135
- I love you too.

54:39.809 --> 54:43.212
- Hey yo, what are
you in here for?

54:43.214 --> 54:45.514
Hey dipshit, you deaf?

54:45.516 --> 54:47.650
Said what are you in here for?

54:47.652 --> 54:49.885
- Being an idiot.

54:49.887 --> 54:52.755
- Well,
con-fucking-gratulations.

54:53.757 --> 54:55.457
Aren't you a peach?

54:56.293 --> 54:58.027
- What did you say?

54:59.629 --> 55:02.364
- What are you a fucking retard?

55:04.234 --> 55:06.568
You one of these
slow di di dits?

55:10.807 --> 55:14.443
You know, you remind me a
lot of my little boy, man.

55:14.445 --> 55:16.245
He's a little bitch.

55:17.180 --> 55:19.381
Soft, just like his mama.

55:22.819 --> 55:26.155
See that's the problem
with kids nowadays.

55:26.157 --> 55:29.892
They're soft, they
got no backbones.

55:29.894 --> 55:31.794
You slap them up a little
bit to show them what's what

55:31.796 --> 55:33.429
and what they do?

55:33.431 --> 55:36.398
They run and call
the cops on you.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.400
What?

55:38.668 --> 55:43.272
You think my old man didn't
smack me up from time to time?

55:43.274 --> 55:44.274
Shit.

55:45.909 --> 55:48.177
That old bastard used
to have this belt,

55:48.179 --> 55:51.347
he used to wrap it around
his hand real, real tight

55:51.349 --> 55:53.482
and then that motherfucker
used to go to town on me.

55:57.120 --> 55:58.887
Used to wake up the next
morning with welts this big

55:58.889 --> 56:00.522
on my back.

56:00.524 --> 56:01.824
But did I cry?

56:02.892 --> 56:04.360
Did I run to school
and tell my teachers

56:04.362 --> 56:06.962
my daddy hit me, my daddy
hit me, like a little

56:06.964 --> 56:08.263
fucking bitch?

56:09.899 --> 56:11.100
Fuck no.

56:11.102 --> 56:12.401
You know why?

56:12.403 --> 56:15.504
'Cause that's the shit
that makes you a man.

56:15.506 --> 56:18.574
But not my boy, no he
can't comprehend that shit.

56:18.576 --> 56:20.876
So fuck it, you know what?

56:22.645 --> 56:24.780
He's got a problem with
me laying my hands on him

56:24.782 --> 56:27.716
and trying to make him man up?

56:27.718 --> 56:29.218
Fuck it.

56:29.220 --> 56:30.853
That little bastard
can raise himself,

56:30.855 --> 56:31.855
you know what I'm saying?

58:07.250 --> 58:09.384
- I'm really sorry, man.

58:12.322 --> 58:13.622
But thank you.

58:16.793 --> 58:18.794
Where'd you get the
money to bail me out?

58:18.796 --> 58:21.363
- Don't worry about it.

58:21.365 --> 58:22.831
- Steve, I know you don't
have that kind of money

58:22.833 --> 58:24.533
just laying around.

58:26.269 --> 58:30.572
Did they give you the life
insurance money already?

58:30.574 --> 58:31.773
Dude, just tell me where
you got the money...

58:31.775 --> 58:34.209
- I got it from curt's
savings, alright?

58:34.211 --> 58:36.512
Child had to bail you out.

58:37.747 --> 58:39.781
I can't believe you, man.

58:39.783 --> 58:42.017
Take a fucking road trip
on a suspended license?

58:42.019 --> 58:44.520
Warrants out your fucking
arrest you don't even tell me?

58:44.522 --> 58:46.255
- I told you, you wouldn't
have let me come, would you?

58:46.257 --> 58:48.357
And I wanna honor mom as well.

58:48.359 --> 58:50.592
- She wasn't your mother.

58:50.594 --> 58:52.794
- Don't fucking say that.

58:54.163 --> 58:55.864
Alright, we have our
differences, I might be a fuckup

58:55.866 --> 58:58.200
and you can be mad at me,
but don't fucking go there.

58:58.202 --> 59:00.402
- Everything you fucking
do affects somebody else,

59:00.404 --> 59:02.137
you know that you
fucking selfish prick?

59:02.139 --> 59:03.906
- Oh, maybe I should be
more responsible like you,

59:03.908 --> 59:05.407
huh?

59:05.409 --> 59:06.775
- Are you being
sarcastic right now?

59:06.777 --> 59:07.843
Huh?

59:07.845 --> 59:09.611
Fucking hope not, man.

59:09.613 --> 59:11.480
You're lucky I'm
fucking here right now.

59:11.482 --> 59:15.050
Always bailing you out of
fucking jail and anything else.

59:15.052 --> 59:16.451
I'm sitting here wondering
when the next fucking time

59:16.453 --> 59:18.754
I have to bail you out is.

59:20.156 --> 59:22.324
Lisa's doing the right thing
keeping chance from you.

59:23.327 --> 59:24.393
- Fuck you!

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:50.112
Need to ask you a favor.

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:51.947
- What?

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:56.385
- Can we stop in St. Louis?

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.187
- Are you serious?

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:00.189
- Yeah.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.559
- That's like 300 miles in
the wrong direction, man.

01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:08.664
I lost three fucking days
'cause of your shenanigans.

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:11.233
- Look, I know we've had
our differences this trip.

01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:14.936
But this is really
important to me, okay?

01:01:14.938 --> 01:01:18.073
Please, I need to
stop in St. Louis.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:23.545
I have to see my dad.

01:01:24.547 --> 01:01:27.082
- Are you sure
he's even ticking?

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:28.784
- Yeah, he's there.

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:46.968
- I'll wait here for you, man.

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:53.308
- Why don't you come in with me?

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.677
- You really want me to?

01:01:55.679 --> 01:01:56.679
- Yeah.

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:00.849
- Let's go.

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:27.275
- Whatever you two are
selling, I ain't buying.

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:33.515
- You really don't
recognize me, do you?

01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:34.583
- Should I?

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:37.185
- Guess not.

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:38.887
It's been 27 years.

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:49.998
- Holy shit.

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:53.735
Clayne?

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.171
- I'm surprised you
even remember my name.

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:57.906
- Jesus Christ boy!

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:01.843
Who's your friend here?

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:04.012
- That's my buddy Steve.

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:05.547
- I remember you.

01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:07.949
Yeah.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.885
These two little bastards
ran all over the neighborhood

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:12.854
causing all kinds of hell.

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:13.856
Yeah.

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:18.093
So how's your mother
doing these days?

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:21.296
- She's great.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.865
She's been dead for 20 years.

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:32.007
- Jeez, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:33.575
- Yeah, so was I.

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:38.079
- Hey look, I'm gonna give
you guys some privacy.

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:40.448
Nice to see you again, sir.

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:43.518
- Well hell.

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:48.356
Say, you boys, you
wanna grab some beers?

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.793
I got a nice little spot
around the corner over here,

01:03:51.795 --> 01:03:53.061
we can...

01:03:53.063 --> 01:03:55.664
- I'm not here to drink
beers with you, bishop.

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:56.666
- No?

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:00.702
What do you want from me?

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:03.972
- What do I want from you?

01:04:03.974 --> 01:04:05.207
Okay for starters
how 'bout you tell me

01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:08.043
why I haven't heard
from you in 27 years?

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:10.312
- You gotta understand
something, son.

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:14.449
Me and your mother, we
didn't get along so well.

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:20.255
I didn't want to make
things worse for you.

01:04:20.257 --> 01:04:25.026
I figured calling and writing
would just make things

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:27.529
harder for you, that's all.

01:04:27.531 --> 01:04:28.997
- Harder for me?

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:31.633
You're my dad.

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:35.270
All I wanted from
you was a kind word.

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:36.538
I miss you.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:37.772
I love you.

01:04:37.774 --> 01:04:39.641
A fucking happy birthday, champ.

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:40.643
Anything!

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:46.381
What kind of piece of shit
just disappears like that?

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:49.050
- So you drove all
the way out here

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.653
to show me that you're
a better man than me?

01:04:51.655 --> 01:04:52.721
Is that it?

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:56.691
Does it make you feel happy?

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.962
See your old man's nothing
but a worthless drunk?

01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:01.964
Yeah.

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:06.968
Is this gonna make
you feel better, boy?

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:09.671
- Not a day has gone by
since you left that I haven't

01:05:09.673 --> 01:05:11.306
thought about you.

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:15.644
Where you were,
what you were doing.

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:19.381
I didn't understand how
someone could not want

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:20.682
their own son.

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:26.087
I used to wish
that you were dead.

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.222
'Cause at least then
there was a reason

01:05:27.224 --> 01:05:29.691
that you weren't calling me.

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.995
Then I found out you were alive.

01:05:33.997 --> 01:05:35.230
So I had to come
up with new reasons

01:05:35.232 --> 01:05:37.299
that you wouldn't call.

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:41.536
I used to think about it,
I'd sit there and imagine

01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:44.039
you'd met this new woman.

01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:48.476
You got married and you
had a family, new kids.

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:51.613
And there's this beautiful
house on a sunny day,

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:54.649
and it's your new
son's birthday.

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:56.785
And it made you think of me.

01:05:56.787 --> 01:06:00.822
So you'd sneak inside
and you'd try to call me.

01:06:00.824 --> 01:06:02.324
And right before I could
pick up your new wife

01:06:02.326 --> 01:06:04.526
would come in and she'd
stop you and you'd have to

01:06:04.528 --> 01:06:05.528
hang up.

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:10.398
Fuck, every time someone
called and hung up

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.767
I thought maybe it was you.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.704
It never was, was it?

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:19.541
- I wanted to call you, son.

01:06:19.543 --> 01:06:20.575
- You wanted to call me?

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:22.944
Well what a fucking relief.

01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:27.415
You know what I do when
I want to talk to my son?

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:31.219
I pick up the goddamn
phone or I go see him.

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:33.555
- You have a son?

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:35.690
- Yeah, I do.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:39.995
And he's the most important
thing in the world to me.

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:43.798
- What's his name?

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.800
- You don't get to know that.

01:06:45.802 --> 01:06:47.035
You know why?

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:48.370
Because you'll never
fucking see him,

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:50.605
and you will never
fucking talk to him.

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:52.173
But what you need to know
is that I will be there

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:53.942
every single day for
him until they put me in

01:06:53.944 --> 01:06:58.046
the ground 'cause that's what
a real fucking father does.

01:06:58.048 --> 01:07:00.081
- Well congratu-fucking-lations.

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:01.083
Huh?

01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:04.853
Ain't you a peach?

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:11.326
What do you want
me to do boy, huh?

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:15.463
Throw you a goddamn parade?

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:16.865
- I want you to sit
there and finish drinking

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.500
yourself to death.

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:21.436
- Clayne!

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.190
- I was just a
little fucking kid!

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:44.559
Why the fuck would
he not want me?

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:45.994
What the fuck did I do?

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:56.404
Why the fuck didn't he want me?

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:59.841
Why the fuck did he not want me?

01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:03.144
Why, I didn't
fucking do anything?

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:04.879
Just a fucking kid!

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:08.483
Fucking little.

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:27.769
- I'm sorry.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.341
I'm here for you, alright?

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:40.782
Come here.

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:44.319
Love you, man.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:49.924
You're a better man than
that, you know that?

01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:50.926
Alright?

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.462
Love you, man.

01:09:15.218 --> 01:09:16.218
- Dayne.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.557
- Are you sure?

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.160
- Absolutely, man.

01:09:25.162 --> 01:09:26.694
That shit I said about
her not being your mother,

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:28.162
that's bullshit.

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:32.133
She raised you like
you were her own.

01:09:32.135 --> 01:09:33.935
We're brothers, man.

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:25.513
- What the fuck was that?

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:27.015
- Oh shit.

01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:28.017
Oh, fuck.

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:30.752
Think I blew a tire.

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:31.754
- Fuck.

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:16.197
This is unbelievable,
GPS is coming in and out,

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:18.099
I can't get no
reception right now.

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:19.233
- Dude, nothing
would work out here.

01:12:19.235 --> 01:12:21.436
I think this is a bad idea.

01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:22.704
- Well what else do
you want from me?

01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:24.405
I don't, you know, seriously?

01:12:24.407 --> 01:12:25.573
- If we stayed on the
highway we might see somebody

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:27.041
coming by.

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:29.077
This way, there's nobody that
way and I remember it was

01:12:29.079 --> 01:12:31.679
like 100 miles to.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.815
- Seriously, like five miles
or so there was a little

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:35.516
gas station rest stop.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:37.952
I don't wanna sit
there and wait.

01:12:37.954 --> 01:12:40.288
- I don't feel like getting
murdered and raped today, man.

01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:42.724
- Nobody wants to get home more
than me right now, alright?

01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:43.925
Please.

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:45.526
This is the fastest
way, I promise.

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:48.229
Come on, GPS, it keeps
coming in and out, man.

01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:50.031
Said like five miles
or something last time

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:52.333
and we've walked at least
a half mile from there.

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:53.334
Check your phone.

01:12:53.336 --> 01:12:54.802
- Are you joking?

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:55.870
Okay, yeah.

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:57.939
Spock?

01:12:57.941 --> 01:12:58.973
Okay yeah, you got us?

01:12:58.975 --> 01:12:59.941
Okay, yeah.

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:01.175
- That's a good one.

01:13:01.177 --> 01:13:02.110
I've no time to joke,
I need to get home.

01:13:02.112 --> 01:13:03.511
- Change mine to a bean burrito.

01:13:03.513 --> 01:13:05.346
Tell Sulu to quit
humping my plant.

01:13:05.348 --> 01:13:08.483
- That's really gonna help
us, that's really good.

01:13:08.485 --> 01:13:09.484
Here comes a Van.

01:13:09.486 --> 01:13:10.485
- What?

01:13:10.487 --> 01:13:11.486
- Van.

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:12.488
Hey!

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:15.123
- Man, that's not a good idea.

01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:16.858
- Not a good, man, seriously,
you wanna stand out

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.559
here and you're sitting
here whining about this,

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.828
let's go, wave him on.

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:21.830
Yo!

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:29.003
Come on, what are you afraid of?

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:35.343
Thanks for stopping, guys.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:39.147
- Looks like you two
are in big trouble.

01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:42.216
- Uh yeah actually our RV
broke down a couple miles back

01:13:42.218 --> 01:13:43.584
on the highway.

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:46.587
- How?

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:48.623
- Oh, good evening sir.

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:53.127
- No, how did it happen?

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:57.098
- Oh, I thought you
guys didn't, you know.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.433
- We just, we blew a tire.

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:00.034
Back on the highway.

01:14:00.036 --> 01:14:02.970
- Very unlucky for
you, white man.

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:07.241
- Yes, your people have
raped and murdered our people

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:08.776
for far too long.

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:12.947
Now we are going to
return the favor.

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.148
- What?

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:14.949
- Oh, okay, take it
easy man, we don't even

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.451
have any money.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:19.787
- Money, money cannot buy
back what the white man

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.489
has stolen from us.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:26.661
The only payment we
want now is blood.

01:14:26.663 --> 01:14:28.229
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- What the fuck is that man?

01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:29.330
Come on.

01:14:29.332 --> 01:14:30.798
- Come on, guys.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.700
- Holy shit, the only
payment we want is blood?

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:34.435
Oh man that's so fucking good!

01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:37.071
- Are they serious?

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:38.073
- Awesome.

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:44.078
- We're just kidding,
we're just kidding.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.079
- My heart is like
pumping right now.

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:48.382
- So can you guys help us, or?

01:14:48.384 --> 01:14:49.951
- I'm just messing
with you, I'm Jack.

01:14:49.953 --> 01:14:50.952
- Steve.

01:14:50.954 --> 01:14:52.587
- This is bill.

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:53.988
- Little nervous with
that but nice to meet you,

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.691
that's good, that's good.

01:14:56.693 --> 01:14:57.925
- Get in the shaggin' wagon,
we'll take you to town,

01:14:57.927 --> 01:14:59.026
alright?

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:00.028
- Woo.

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:05.600
- Guys, it's cool, we're
not gonna rape you.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.168
- Awesome.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:08.236
Comforting.

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:11.272
- They seem pretty good,
they seem pretty harmless.

01:15:11.274 --> 01:15:12.473
- Yeah, it's your
idea, get in the Van.

01:15:12.475 --> 01:15:13.975
- Well come on if you're
gonna come with us,

01:15:13.977 --> 01:15:18.212
I gotta catch the new south
park anyways so let's go.

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:25.386
- Got it?

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:28.556
- Gotta fix that door.

01:15:28.558 --> 01:15:31.692
- Yeah, well it's on our
to-do list, we'll get to it.

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.928
- Thanks boys, appreciate it.

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:35.663
- Hey, make sure to Facebook me.

01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:36.898
- Absolutely.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.767
- Thanks again, both
of you guys, seriously.

01:15:39.769 --> 01:15:40.868
- Yeah, no problem.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.236
- Us white folk owe you one.

01:15:43.473 --> 01:15:44.438
- Think you owe
us more than one.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.840
- Hey ho!

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:48.010
- Shit.

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:52.780
- Nah but in all
seriousness it's nice to see

01:15:52.782 --> 01:15:54.615
that not everyone's forgotten
about honoring those

01:15:54.617 --> 01:15:56.717
that came before us.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.019
Dorothy'd be proud.

01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:02.089
Take care of yourselves,
have a blessed journey.

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.236
- Dude, why didn't
you wake me up?

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:17.371
- You were sleeping like a baby.

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:19.173
I gotta check on the RV anyway.

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:20.808
- What'd they say?

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:24.312
- It's not good.

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.315
Expensive ass tow, tire
repair, we're not gonna

01:16:27.317 --> 01:16:29.884
have enough to get home, man.

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.054
I dunno, sucks.

01:16:33.056 --> 01:16:34.056
- Fuck!

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:36.824
- Yeah, we are fucked.

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:39.393
- Fuck, I'm sorry.

01:16:41.196 --> 01:16:43.998
I know this is on me, I know
I cost you a lot this trip.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.132
- It's fine.

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:48.703
- No, I swear to god I'm
gonna pay you back, and curt.

01:16:48.705 --> 01:16:50.204
- I'm not worried
about that right now.

01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:52.273
I just wanna find a way to
get fucking home right now.

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:53.507
- We'll get you home.

01:16:53.509 --> 01:16:54.442
And I know you're not
worried about this,

01:16:54.444 --> 01:16:56.510
but I need you to hear me.

01:16:56.512 --> 01:16:58.212
All the shit we gone
through on this trip,

01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:00.081
all I've been able to
think about is my boy,

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:02.783
and he deserves better
than I had and he's gonna

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:04.185
fucking get it.

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:07.588
All this other shit, it's done.

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:10.758
It's him and Lisa,
that's it for me.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.293
I'm gonna go home, I'm
gonna finish that training,

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:13.661
I'm gonna get one of those
jobs you keep hounding me

01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:14.795
about, okay?

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:17.431
I swear to god, man.

01:17:19.134 --> 01:17:21.168
- Alright, that's good.

01:17:23.438 --> 01:17:26.907
Let's just reroute ourselves
and find a fucking way home.

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:30.878
The motel guy told me that
hoover dam's 40 miles from here.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.614
We head there, head to la,
shoot straight up the coast,

01:17:33.616 --> 01:17:35.816
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:36.884
- Well when's curt's birthday?

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:38.285
- Tomorrow.

01:17:38.287 --> 01:17:39.487
Fuck.

01:17:39.489 --> 01:17:42.890
That's why I'm so
fucking stressed out.

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:44.392
- La's done.

01:17:44.394 --> 01:17:46.427
If the hoover dam's right
there like he's saying,

01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:48.129
we scoot over, we
spread some ashes,

01:17:48.131 --> 01:17:50.698
and then we fucking burn
it all the way home.

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:51.899
I'll get you there.

01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:53.467
- Let's do it, let's do it.

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:54.469
Let's go.

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:25.032
- yo!

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.667
Steve, let's go.

01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:27.768
Get off the phone.

01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:28.769
- What?

01:18:28.771 --> 01:18:30.004
- Come on.

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:30.805
- Babe, alright, let
me call you back.

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:31.772
I know, I love you too.

01:18:31.774 --> 01:18:32.840
Alright, bye.

01:18:32.842 --> 01:18:34.108
- I love her too.

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:34.942
Okay, we're getting on
the chopper, let's go.

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:35.943
- No no no.

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:36.944
- Yeah yeah yeah.

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:38.145
This is fucking perfect.

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:39.080
- Dude I don't have
that much money.

01:18:39.082 --> 01:18:39.947
- I got it taken care of.

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:40.948
- Clayne.

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:41.950
- Yeah.

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:44.652
- We're not getting on
a fucking helicopter.

01:18:44.654 --> 01:18:45.853
- Dude, I already
got our tickets.

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:47.555
- We have to go.

01:18:47.557 --> 01:18:49.056
- Listen, the guys an old fucking
army fucking pilot, okay?

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:51.792
I told him my dad flew in the
war, big fucking sob story,

01:18:51.794 --> 01:18:53.060
I told him what we were doing.

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:54.562
- Your dad was never
in the fucking army.

01:18:54.564 --> 01:18:55.863
- Don't worry about it, he
doesn't know that, let's go.

01:18:55.865 --> 01:18:56.897
- Are you serious?

01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:58.032
- Yes!

01:18:58.034 --> 01:18:59.034
Come on!

01:19:34.836 --> 01:19:37.171
- the hoover dam is
one of America's great

01:19:37.173 --> 01:19:39.473
engineering feats.

01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:42.476
It has enough concrete
in it to pave a road

01:19:42.478 --> 01:19:46.614
all the way from San
Francisco to New York City.

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:50.217
It was built during the
great depression, and your

01:19:50.219 --> 01:19:52.486
father always told me
that it was a testimony

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:55.356
to the great American spirit.

01:19:55.358 --> 01:19:59.493
To make things go right
when things were tough.

01:20:24.187 --> 01:20:25.419
- Who could pull
a plan together?

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:26.887
Tell me, look at me,
look at me right now!

01:20:26.889 --> 01:20:28.088
Was that fucking amazing?

01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:29.056
- Yeah.

01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:31.625
- Oh god, it was beautiful!

01:20:31.627 --> 01:20:33.694
Mama Dee would have
loved that shit.

01:20:33.696 --> 01:20:34.695
- Yeah she would have.

01:20:34.697 --> 01:20:35.830
- She did love it.

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:36.832
Woo!

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:49.643
- Mommy, when is
daddy gonna be home?

01:20:49.645 --> 01:20:52.680
- Daddy's gonna be
home soon, okay?

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:55.416
Now get back to bed.

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:02.022
- Lay off the throttle a little.

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:03.224
- Dude, I don't know
what she's doing,

01:21:03.226 --> 01:21:04.906
making all kinds of
funky noises right now.

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:07.394
- Oh my god.

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:08.395
- Oh no no no, she's smoking.

01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:09.396
- Yeah, this is not good.

01:21:09.398 --> 01:21:10.564
- Oh my god.

01:21:10.566 --> 01:21:11.599
- Look at the
fucking Gauge, man!

01:21:11.601 --> 01:21:13.033
Come on!

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:13.968
- These don't work, they
haven't moved in like a week!

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:15.536
- Fucking pull over.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:16.904
- Jesus Christ.

01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:22.042
What do you think it is?

01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:23.611
- I don't know til
I get the hood up.

01:21:23.613 --> 01:21:24.845
- Is she hot?

01:21:26.348 --> 01:21:27.514
- Yeah.

01:21:27.516 --> 01:21:28.949
- Ooh!

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:29.951
God damn.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:31.752
Hook that?

01:21:31.754 --> 01:21:32.987
- I got it.

01:21:32.989 --> 01:21:35.823
- Watch your hand,
watch your hand.

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:39.026
Oh, fuck.

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:44.932
Alright, it's smoking like this
and leaking that much, man.

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:47.368
Could be anything.

01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:49.904
Water pump, thermostat,
I don't know man.

01:21:49.906 --> 01:21:51.372
- Just needs some water.

01:21:51.374 --> 01:21:53.507
- Yeah, even if we do
that, that's just gonna

01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:54.842
buy us time.

01:21:54.844 --> 01:21:57.044
We'll have to pull over
like every 15 miles.

01:21:57.046 --> 01:21:58.846
- Dude, it's better
than nothing.

01:21:58.848 --> 01:22:00.381
We need to keep going.

01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:02.016
Let's put some water in
her and see what she needs.

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:04.385
Let her cool and get some water.

01:22:04.387 --> 01:22:05.686
- Alright, I'm
gonna take a piss.

01:22:05.688 --> 01:22:06.688
- Alright.

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:14.662
- Boom.

01:22:14.664 --> 01:22:15.664
- What?

01:22:17.532 --> 01:22:18.532
Demolition derby?

01:22:18.534 --> 01:22:19.533
- Yeah.

01:22:19.535 --> 01:22:20.535
$500.

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:24.238
- Are you serious?

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.806
You wanna enter
this into the derby?

01:22:25.808 --> 01:22:27.141
- Fuck yeah, why not?

01:22:27.143 --> 01:22:29.176
- Fucking die trying, dude.

01:22:29.178 --> 01:22:30.344
This thing can't even run.

01:22:30.346 --> 01:22:31.578
- Who gives a shit?

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:32.780
- I put water in it
to keep it breathing.

01:22:32.782 --> 01:22:34.081
- All it needs to do
is get fucking smashed,

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:36.116
and it's my RV so
I'm gonna do it.

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:37.851
We need that money.

01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:44.024
- You really wanna do this?

01:22:44.026 --> 01:22:46.160
- What else are we
gonna fucking do?

01:22:46.162 --> 01:22:51.098
We need the money, we gotta
get you home, come on.

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.100
- Fuck it.

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:53.801
Derby it is.

01:22:53.803 --> 01:22:54.902
- Woo!

01:22:54.904 --> 01:22:56.203
- Let's do it.

01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:08.816
- It's a fucking demolition
derby, what possible

01:23:08.818 --> 01:23:10.818
requirements could you have?

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.053
- Like I told you before,
fuck nut, there's specific

01:23:13.055 --> 01:23:14.855
modifications you have
to have to your vehicle

01:23:14.857 --> 01:23:17.224
in order to enter the derby
and you don't have 'em.

01:23:17.226 --> 01:23:19.326
There's specific
regulations for safety.

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:21.128
- Well do you have a
specific regulations for what

01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:22.730
I can shove right up your ass?

01:23:22.732 --> 01:23:24.732
- Whoa whoa Dayne, Dayne,
what the fuck are you doing?

01:23:24.734 --> 01:23:25.933
Chill out.

01:23:25.935 --> 01:23:27.167
- I tell you what I'm
gonna do, hip hop.

01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:28.669
I'm gonna let you
enter the derby.

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:30.404
I'm even gonna give you
two the vehicle to drive.

01:23:30.406 --> 01:23:34.742
But when you lose, and you
will lose, it's gonna be

01:23:34.744 --> 01:23:37.044
$5,000 out of your pocket.

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:40.881
But if by some miracle
you do win, I'll pay you

01:23:40.883 --> 01:23:45.185
and sweet cheeks $500 to
get the fuck out of here.

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.287
- It's what we came to do.

01:23:47.289 --> 01:23:49.056
- Alright tiny, let's do it.

01:23:49.058 --> 01:23:50.657
- Daisy, hand me the book.

01:23:50.659 --> 01:23:53.594
So which one of you two pretty
little boys are gonna drive?

01:23:53.596 --> 01:23:54.862
- Me.

01:23:54.864 --> 01:23:56.730
- You gonna drive?

01:23:56.732 --> 01:23:57.865
- I'm gonna get us home.

01:23:57.867 --> 01:23:58.966
- Sign here.

01:23:58.968 --> 01:24:00.868
Initial here and here.

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:05.239
Your car'll be out front.

01:24:05.241 --> 01:24:06.673
- Do me a favor, charge
yourself a sleeve

01:24:06.675 --> 01:24:09.810
to cover that stupid
fucking tattoo.

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:13.914
Yo man, you sure
you wanna do this?

01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:15.549
- Yeah, I have to.

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.220
- Man, honestly I think
we got a lot better chance

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:23.257
of winning that money
if I'm behind the wheel.

01:24:23.259 --> 01:24:26.393
- I got this man,
trust me, alright?

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:32.953
- You fucking did it man!

01:26:32.955 --> 01:26:34.454
Right, you okay?

01:26:34.456 --> 01:26:38.792
Fucking amazing, listen to
them, they fucking love you.

01:26:38.794 --> 01:26:39.794
Woo!

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.414
Alright, whichever way
this turns out we need

01:27:00.416 --> 01:27:01.949
to get the fuck
out of here, okay?

01:27:01.951 --> 01:27:03.417
So we're gonna stash the
bags behind the shed,

01:27:03.419 --> 01:27:05.319
if we get separated, meet
there and we're gonna

01:27:05.321 --> 01:27:07.287
get the hell out, alright?

01:27:07.289 --> 01:27:08.288
- Yeah, let's do it.

01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:09.290
- Alright.

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:11.858
Hey.

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:14.394
What are we doing here?

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.396
- What do you mean?

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:18.332
- Why'd you push for
this trip so soon after

01:27:18.334 --> 01:27:19.800
your mom passed?

01:27:24.139 --> 01:27:28.442
- Stevie, I want
you to know I'm proud of you.

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:34.982
You're a good man.

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:41.188
You gave me a wonderful
grandchild who lights up my world

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:49.763
and someday he's gonna
be a great person.

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:59.106
He may even build a monument
that stands for something

01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:03.744
greater than all of us.

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:05.646
- Mom.

01:28:09.617 --> 01:28:12.152
There're just rock and metal.

01:28:12.154 --> 01:28:16.189
You spent your whole life
obsessing about them.

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.762
- They, they always...

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:25.132
- always what, mom?

01:28:25.134 --> 01:28:27.367
- Gave me hope.

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:39.379
- Mom?

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.707
- Fuck, I'm sorry.

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:08.842
- Yeah.

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:11.845
Let's do this.

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:48.508
- That was awesome, man.

01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:49.976
- That was pretty crazy.

01:30:53.715 --> 01:30:56.883
So you sure you're gonna be
able to find a ride home?

01:30:56.885 --> 01:30:59.219
- Come on, who you talking to?

01:30:59.221 --> 01:31:02.088
Alright, take that
money, get your flight.

01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:03.757
You earned it, wild man.

01:31:03.759 --> 01:31:05.192
- I did.

01:31:05.194 --> 01:31:06.193
I did.

01:31:06.195 --> 01:31:07.994
- Plus, you know me.

01:31:07.996 --> 01:31:10.497
I turn problems into solutions.

01:31:10.499 --> 01:31:12.332
- Is that right, John Lennon?

01:31:12.334 --> 01:31:13.334
- Yeah.

01:31:16.938 --> 01:31:18.738
What a fucking trip.

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:22.409
- Yeah, I'm never gonna
be able to look at

01:31:22.411 --> 01:31:24.711
a United States
map the same way.

01:31:24.713 --> 01:31:28.114
Every little no name
town, street sign,

01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:34.654
it all means so much more
now, you know what I mean?

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:38.658
- Gonna try to kiss
me, aren't you?

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:39.659
- You'd like that.

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:40.660
- You poet.

01:31:40.662 --> 01:31:41.662
- You'd like that.

01:31:42.798 --> 01:31:45.065
- Weird question.

01:31:45.067 --> 01:31:47.033
- Have no doubts, man.

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:50.904
- Is there any of mom left?

01:31:50.906 --> 01:31:53.707
- Saved a little
bit for Aberdeen.

01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:54.709
- Okay.

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:03.650
What's up boss?

01:32:03.652 --> 01:32:04.951
Get home safe.

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:09.623
- How's it going?

01:32:15.496 --> 01:32:16.963
Hold on one sec.

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:20.166
I believe you, man.

01:32:20.168 --> 01:32:21.401
- About what?

01:32:22.436 --> 01:32:25.839
- You say you want
to change your life.

01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:28.642
- I'm just ready to make
people's lives better instead

01:32:28.644 --> 01:32:29.644
of worse.

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:33.513
- You already have, man.
