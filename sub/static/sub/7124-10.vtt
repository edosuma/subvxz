00:25.998 --> 00:29.364
Princess, he did it!
Root Beer Guy set up the force field!

00:29.429 --> 00:33.104
- But he sacrificed himself to do it.
- It's an ugly scene, man.

00:33.169 --> 00:34.614
Let me see!

00:43.944 --> 00:48.850
- Rest in peace, Root Beer Guy.
- Give up now, Princess, and I,

00:48.915 --> 00:54.475
Maja the Sky Witch, promise not to
completely donk up your kingdom.

00:54.540 --> 00:59.662
I make no such promise.
Darren must feed.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.076
Oh, glob! Oh, oh, oh!

01:02.141 --> 01:06.841
- Oh, well. What can you do?
- Crunchy, chill. Chill.

01:12.336 --> 01:19.251
Keepers of the clock, masters
of dimension, bear witness!

01:19.316 --> 01:24.308
By my power,
I compel you to converge!

01:25.584 --> 01:29.953
Past and present, be one!

01:30.130 --> 01:33.950
Awaken the terror
of a forgotten age

01:34.023 --> 01:40.052
in this moment that is all
moments in the blink of an eye.

01:40.409 --> 01:45.820
Darren, the ancient sleeper, arise!

01:49.861 --> 01:54.441
I had a dream I was fighting
an army that could birth new

01:54.506 --> 01:57.939
soldiers from their own blood.

01:58.004 --> 02:00.162
I was endless.

02:00.227 --> 02:02.391
Does
that make sense?

02:02.456 --> 02:06.027
Yes. You want to go
conquer the Candy Kingdom?

02:06.092 --> 02:07.138
What's that?

02:07.203 --> 02:09.870
It's a place that
contains the highest

02:09.935 --> 02:14.160
levels of caring and sentimental
affection in all of ooo.

02:14.225 --> 02:18.578
What is caring?
What kind of world is this?

02:18.643 --> 02:22.598
It's a feeling I use in
my magic to give me power.

02:22.663 --> 02:27.750
Like this shirt that was once the prized
possession of Princess Bubblegum.

02:27.815 --> 02:32.004
With the feelings in this shirt,
I was able to summon you.

02:32.069 --> 02:36.249
I don't... walk me through this.

02:36.314 --> 02:40.021
- All right.
- This kingdom of candy...

02:40.086 --> 02:42.904
- Yes?
- I will lay it to waste,

02:42.969 --> 02:45.047
turn their people to salt.

02:45.112 --> 02:46.202
Yeah...

02:46.386 --> 02:49.259
And garnish a million
meals with the salt,

02:49.324 --> 02:52.343
which we will eat for eternity.

02:52.408 --> 02:54.160
That's not my plan exactly,

02:54.225 --> 02:56.497
but you'll be fine.
I promise.

02:56.562 --> 03:01.168
I promise, as well, to deliver
destruction so thorough

03:01.233 --> 03:03.964
that all realities are affected.

03:04.046 --> 03:06.515
Okay. We'll talk about that.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.955
All realities.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.916
Hey! We'll talk about it!

03:12.063 --> 03:15.229
Break this witch out, Darren.

03:17.904 --> 03:20.974
How long will your force
field hold, Gridface Princess?

03:21.039 --> 03:23.295
The sleeper's magic
is older then legend.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.425
I don't know how he disabled both
gumball guardians,

03:26.490 --> 03:29.048
but at least
I know my tech is tight.

03:29.113 --> 03:33.090
The field will hold long
enough for you to think of a weak plan.

03:35.095 --> 03:38.421
- Colonel Candy Corn?
- Hrr, uh, yes, Princess.

03:38.486 --> 03:41.694
Ready the cannons, you got me?
If they get through that barrier,

03:41.759 --> 03:43.916
I don't want to have
to use our ground troops.

03:43.981 --> 03:45.600
Will do, Princess.

03:45.665 --> 03:47.282
And let me just say...

03:47.347 --> 03:50.153
Thank you for
putting this old crease back in the field.

03:50.218 --> 03:54.229
I haven't been the same since
my lovely Linda passed away.

03:54.294 --> 03:55.929
Yeah. Good luck.

03:55.994 --> 03:58.383
Oh, I tried dating
again, you know?

03:58.448 --> 04:01.968
But these young girls think
I'm too serious or something.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.235
Why don't you date
someone your own age?

04:04.300 --> 04:06.408
Peppermint Butler, come on!

04:06.473 --> 04:09.946
Oh, women my age don't hang out.
Where are they hiding?

04:10.011 --> 04:16.459
I need a young girl with an
old soul to heal my heart.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.764
This is taking too long.

04:19.829 --> 04:21.805
Then do the thing!

04:21.962 --> 04:26.881
I call forth the legion of
Cadmus, the Dragon's Teeth!

04:27.067 --> 04:31.732
What am I supposed to... Oh!
Party's starting. Load 'em up, soldiers!

04:31.797 --> 04:34.347
Yeah, just put it in there.
I don't know.

04:34.412 --> 04:36.440
Oh, dang!

04:38.077 --> 04:41.499
- Blah, gah, lah, glah!
- Fire!

04:53.794 --> 04:59.999
- Whoo! Blah!
- Finn and Jake, are you ready... What the?

05:00.064 --> 05:03.296
- Finn? Where the jam is Finn?!
- I don't know.

05:03.361 --> 05:06.364
- Weren't they just here?
- What the jam?!

05:11.895 --> 05:17.774
All right. Finn or no Finn,
PB's got to get in that biz. Hyah!

05:17.980 --> 05:21.245
- Why have you stopped firing?
- We ran out of ammo, Colonel.

05:21.310 --> 05:25.808
- That's nonsense, soldier.
- Rah! Ah!

05:27.384 --> 05:34.369
This is how you defend your kingdom!
Fire, you wimps! Ya-ha!

05:34.434 --> 05:40.138
- Ah!
- For the kingdom!

05:40.203 --> 05:45.368
- For the king... dom!
- Oh, zang!

06:02.362 --> 06:06.885
- Eat it, tranch!
- Oh!

06:06.950 --> 06:11.683
Aah!
Oh!

06:11.841 --> 06:17.948
It's over, Princess. Prepare to be
annihilated across all dimensions.

06:18.013 --> 06:22.517
- Princess! No!
- Wait, Darren! Dial it back.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.885
I need her residual feelings.

06:24.950 --> 06:27.379
What the flip is feelings?

06:27.444 --> 06:31.311
Darren only understands
life and death!

06:32.139 --> 06:35.498
- Wah!
- What the slizz?

06:35.563 --> 06:39.359
- Yeah, boy!
- Hi, Darren.

06:39.424 --> 06:42.380
The Ancient Psychic
Tandem War Elephant?!

06:42.445 --> 06:45.398
Eli, were you
asleep forever, too?

06:45.463 --> 06:50.179
All this stuff is different now.
What are we even doing here?

06:50.244 --> 06:53.349
Yes, it's been
a difficult adjustment.

06:53.414 --> 06:56.543
- Blaze his face, Eli!
- Yes, master.

07:00.569 --> 07:02.664
Yo! Leave me out of it!

07:06.480 --> 07:08.379
No!

07:17.485 --> 07:19.755
Yeah, right.

07:26.021 --> 07:30.686
- Finn, his weakness is his brain-seed.
- Okay!

07:30.751 --> 07:37.137
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo! Oh, uh!

07:38.165 --> 07:42.716
- Aah!
- Thank you.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.678
Whoa!

07:55.502 --> 07:59.715
- Well, I guess my kids still have a daddy.
- Bam, you dope!

07:59.780 --> 08:03.803
Party tonight in the Candy Kingdom!

08:05.838 --> 08:08.291
- Hey, where's Finn?
- Hi!

08:08.452 --> 08:13.017
Okay. Y'all bring food and bevs.
Finn, you make the guac, all right?

08:13.082 --> 08:19.678
- I'll the guaaaaaaaac.
- Finn! Finn!

08:20.080 --> 08:24.388
- Yo! What's up, A.P.T. Dubs-y?
- What do I do now?

08:24.453 --> 08:28.034
Dude, I don't know.
Probably not go back in the basement.

08:28.099 --> 08:30.997
You're so big'uns.
You should be free, boy.

08:31.062 --> 08:36.071
Free to do what?
I need psychic commands.

08:36.195 --> 08:38.005
Can you help me dice
tomatoes for this guac?

08:38.070 --> 08:42.073
No. - You see, man,
I feel weird giving you orders.

08:42.138 --> 08:45.196
You should just do your own
thing. Realize your potential.

08:45.261 --> 08:50.844
But this is what I am... A war
machine who serves its master.

08:50.909 --> 08:53.692
No, man.
You're more than that. Whoops!

08:53.757 --> 08:57.713
I see into your brain, remember?
You'll do great. Just go for it.

08:57.781 --> 09:02.702
- I believe in you, man. Oh, word. Thanks.
- Maybe Darren was right.

09:02.767 --> 09:07.472
- There's no place for my ancient ways.
- Don't think like that, dude!

09:07.537 --> 09:09.550
Come back and see us whenevs!

09:16.864 --> 09:20.913
I'm doing this for a reason.
What choice is there?

09:20.978 --> 09:25.928
- Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!
- Must feed babies.

09:26.523 --> 09:33.790
Hey! Elephant. I'm more ancient than you.
Someday, I will engulf the solar system.

09:33.855 --> 09:39.279
What was and what will be is meaningless.
Meanwhile, you should wonder...

09:39.344 --> 09:43.855
Are you just a two-headed pile of meat
on a crash course with the cosmic dump?

09:43.920 --> 09:48.829
Or do you contain the soul memory
of a million dead stars?

09:48.960 --> 09:52.761
How do you light a
candle without a match?

09:57.271 --> 10:02.201
Hello? Who's that?
Why can't I see jack?

10:02.266 --> 10:05.951
You bonked your head.
You're in a coma.

10:06.016 --> 10:10.655
- But I can help.
- Um, all right. Are you, like, powerful?

10:10.720 --> 10:15.179
Yes. I can fly and do
lasers from my nose.

10:15.255 --> 10:18.936
Okay. I can run with this.
Take me to the Candy Kingdom

10:19.001 --> 10:23.745
- and shoot your laser nose at it.
- No. I must decide, in this moment,

10:23.810 --> 10:28.256
what is best. For now,
I am the match and the candle.

10:28.321 --> 10:32.467
- What?
- I will be your friend and keep you alive,

10:32.532 --> 10:37.677
- until you regain consciousness, maybe.
- Ugh, that plan sounds like dirt!

10:37.806 --> 10:44.582
- See through my eyes, Maja.
- Ah! It's bright! Wait!

10:44.647 --> 10:49.080
You're the flippin' elephant!
You laser-nosed me! Somebody help!

10:49.145 --> 10:51.702
Oh, my glob! Somebody!

10:55.364 --> 10:57.922
Well, this wasn't
part of my plan.

10:57.987 --> 11:00.511
Hey, man.
I'm gonna eat you.
