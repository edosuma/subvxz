WEBVTT

00:00.007 --> 00:01.304
Last time y'all saw Star...

00:01.306 --> 00:02.832
There's a big music festival coming here

00:02.834 --> 00:04.866
to Atlanta, and the
deadline is in two days.

00:04.868 --> 00:05.788
Turn it off.

00:05.790 --> 00:07.013
Didn't you used to
sing with Mixed Harmony?

00:07.015 --> 00:07.982
That's none of your business.

00:07.984 --> 00:09.818
This has to do with you and me.

00:09.853 --> 00:12.148
I look my mother. I
sound like my mother.

00:12.150 --> 00:13.517
And I have more talent
than you ever did.

00:13.519 --> 00:15.123
Bitch, you ain't your mother.

00:15.125 --> 00:16.891
I just don't want those
girls to go through

00:16.893 --> 00:17.856
what I went through.

00:17.858 --> 00:20.261
I bet everything I had
on you dumb bitches,

00:20.263 --> 00:21.930
and you blew it. Mary with the drugs,

00:21.932 --> 00:23.464
and you, gaining all that weight,

00:23.466 --> 00:25.033
never showing up on time.

00:25.035 --> 00:27.402
- This is Eva. She's my niece.
- Hola.

00:27.404 --> 00:29.184
Simone's
foster father is here.

00:29.186 --> 00:30.538
He'd been raping
that girl for years.

00:30.540 --> 00:31.706
That's why they ran away.

00:31.708 --> 00:32.740
Let's go handle business.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.908
I didn't kill Otis.

00:33.910 --> 00:35.043
Well, if Simone

00:35.045 --> 00:36.027
didn't kill him,

00:36.029 --> 00:37.695
then who did?

00:39.683 --> 00:42.250
God.

00:42.252 --> 00:44.853
Sometimes I get
all up in my head.

00:44.855 --> 00:48.022
I start thinking bad things,

00:48.024 --> 00:50.859
and then bad things happen.

00:50.861 --> 00:54.529
I think all secrets
are best buried.

00:54.531 --> 00:57.365
Help me get these girls
through this murder,

00:57.367 --> 01:00.802
and forgive me for the sins
I commit along the way.

01:02.706 --> 01:04.539
I know you looking after them,

01:04.541 --> 01:06.474
'cause it's clear I can't
stop this girl group thing

01:06.476 --> 01:09.043
from happening.

01:12.749 --> 01:15.450
Good.

01:15.452 --> 01:16.784
All right.

01:16.786 --> 01:18.052
You ladies can take a break.

01:18.054 --> 01:20.855
I just got to adjust
the lights for a sec.

01:22.938 --> 01:24.893
You guys look great.

01:24.895 --> 01:26.527
Great.

01:26.529 --> 01:28.963
But, listen, we got to
stick around and rehearse.

01:28.965 --> 01:30.198
"Rehearse"? After this?

01:30.200 --> 01:31.332
Yeah.

01:31.334 --> 01:33.067
Oh, no, I'm good. I'm going home.

01:33.069 --> 01:35.280
We know that number.

01:35.305 --> 01:38.072
You girls got no idea what
you're up against, do you?

01:38.074 --> 01:40.233
The talent pool in Atlanta is a beast.

01:40.258 --> 01:42.510
Y'all got four days
till the live auditions.

01:42.512 --> 01:44.178
You better be the
baddest chicks out there.

01:44.180 --> 01:45.914
All right,
ladies, I'm all set. Let's go.

01:45.938 --> 01:48.049
Hey, listen, can we wrap this
up soon, I mean, if you can?

01:48.051 --> 01:50.652
Yeah, don't
worry about it, just a few more.

01:50.654 --> 01:52.887
All right.

01:53.990 --> 01:56.057
- Good.
- Yeah, that looks good.

01:56.059 --> 01:58.259
Yeah, it looks better. It looks better.

01:58.261 --> 01:59.794
All right. Can you switch for me?

02:00.970 --> 02:03.298
- I got this. - No,
the-the other way.

02:03.323 --> 02:04.499
Switch?

02:04.501 --> 02:06.234
Yeah, there you go.

02:08.170 --> 02:10.939
Yeah.

02:10.941 --> 02:13.107
Can we get some more powder
on this one over here?

02:15.412 --> 02:18.279
Yeah, that's like the third
time you've put makeup on me.

02:19.482 --> 02:20.982
It's just a lighting issue, sweetheart.

02:20.984 --> 02:23.284
No, more like a color issue, sweetheart.

02:23.286 --> 02:26.654
I don't see you powdering
their faces every 15 minutes.

02:27.857 --> 02:29.724
You know what? It's all good.

02:29.726 --> 02:31.259
We got what we needed.

02:32.562 --> 02:35.196
- What is your problem?
- I'm really sorry.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.597
You don't see this?

02:36.599 --> 02:37.999
This hack that calls
himself a photographer

02:38.001 --> 02:40.268
is trying to lighten me
up to blend with you two.

02:40.270 --> 02:41.669
Oh my God, dude, you're being sensitive.

02:41.671 --> 02:43.237
I'm being sensitive.

02:43.239 --> 02:45.373
He was practically salivating
taking photos of you.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.208
Yeah, I have that affect on people.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.121
It's not new.

02:48.146 --> 02:49.544
It's not cute.

02:51.348 --> 02:53.448
I'm going back to the salon.

02:58.328 --> 03:00.228
You know she's right.

03:05.362 --> 03:07.328
I really don't get why you won't

03:07.330 --> 03:08.663
at least let me try.

03:08.665 --> 03:10.398
Girl, you... you crazy.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.633
I am not letting you dye my hair.

03:12.635 --> 03:15.737
I'm guinea pig enough
just letting you wash it.

03:21.111 --> 03:23.478
What y'all fighting about now?

03:23.480 --> 03:26.881
Joan Smalls is mad because
she didn't get pampered enough

03:26.883 --> 03:29.217
yesterday at the photo shoot.

03:29.219 --> 03:30.918
What happened?

03:30.920 --> 03:33.688
A photographer was too
focused on the two Lite-Brites

03:33.690 --> 03:35.757
instead of taking the actual photo.

03:35.759 --> 03:39.460
Some things never change.

03:39.462 --> 03:43.664
Look, now is not the time to
get into a catfight, ladies.

03:47.537 --> 03:50.171
A man was murdered last week,

03:50.173 --> 03:51.806
and somebody did it.

03:51.808 --> 03:53.074
It was probably her.

03:53.076 --> 03:54.509
You walk around here like you're

03:54.511 --> 03:55.710
some out of place
victim. You've probably

03:55.712 --> 03:57.145
got a shank in that
Chanel lipstick case.

03:57.147 --> 03:59.247
You stabbed
a man once already

03:59.249 --> 04:00.548
- and left him for dead.
- Yeah, I did.

04:00.550 --> 04:02.116
I said, knock it off.

04:02.118 --> 04:03.751
Of course you're proud of it.

04:08.854 --> 04:10.821
Damn. Jahil won't let up.

04:10.823 --> 04:12.489
He keeps calling about the song.

04:12.491 --> 04:14.958
Somebody needs to get you in line.

04:15.793 --> 04:17.594
He got rid of that body for us.

04:17.596 --> 04:20.497
Yeah, so after what he just did,

04:20.499 --> 04:21.793
if he tells you to jump,

04:21.817 --> 04:24.318
you need to be asking how high.

04:24.343 --> 04:27.037
Simone, go get me some
conditioner out of the garage.

04:27.039 --> 04:29.473
It's in that box next
to the old water heater.

Simone, hurry up!

05:23.765 --> 05:25.598
We'll be late.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.984
I'm coming.

06:33.900 --> 06:36.868
Simone, come on. We
can't be late on your first day.

06:39.074 --> 06:41.341
I ain't got time for
your activating, boy.

06:41.343 --> 06:44.043
Come on, Miss C. Can I
get in my good morning?

06:44.045 --> 06:45.244
- Hey, Simone.
- Hey.

06:45.246 --> 06:46.846
Good morning, now keep walking.

06:46.848 --> 06:49.082
I got enough of them damn
fliers in the salon already.

06:49.084 --> 06:51.351
People got to stay woke.

06:51.353 --> 06:53.886
No disrespect, Miss C,
but don't turn a blind eye.

06:53.888 --> 06:57.790
You see they killing us
out here, and it's real.

06:57.792 --> 07:01.027
My mother got her teeth knocked
out so that you could vote.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.162
Don't tell me about
turning no blind eye.

07:03.164 --> 07:04.430
I'm woke.

07:04.432 --> 07:07.734
But I got to live life, too.

07:07.736 --> 07:09.402
I'll put some up at school.

07:09.404 --> 07:10.703
Really?

07:10.705 --> 07:12.739
Well, you can take these.

07:12.741 --> 07:14.240
Yeah.

07:14.242 --> 07:17.377
Got to stay woke.

07:19.614 --> 07:23.149
Simone, walk.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.023
You don't have to be
nervous about what happened.

07:31.025 --> 07:32.592
He's dead.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.065
I saw a video.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.566
"A video"?

07:40.568 --> 07:42.201
Of my mother singing.

07:42.203 --> 07:44.704
What was you doing
digging through my stuff?

07:44.706 --> 07:47.507
I-I saw it next to the conditioner.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.110
Well...

07:51.112 --> 07:54.380
that was a long time ago.

07:54.382 --> 07:56.481
Carlotta, if we do this right,

07:56.506 --> 07:58.718
I think this song could
get us back on track.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.421
It better. We don't got
a lot of options left.

08:01.423 --> 08:03.122
Hey.

08:04.726 --> 08:06.726
I waited up for you last night, Jahil.

08:06.728 --> 08:08.094
Oh, I'm sorry, babe.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.840
I had some business
I had to take care of.

08:10.865 --> 08:14.434
Wait till you see what
I got planned for y'all.

08:14.436 --> 08:15.902
Hey, you know what?

08:15.904 --> 08:18.638
On this take, let's
try it with just Mary.

08:18.640 --> 08:19.939
What do you mean,

08:19.941 --> 08:22.341
- try it with just Mary?
- Just this take.

08:22.343 --> 08:24.844
You know, the producer thinks
she has an interesting vibe.

08:24.846 --> 08:26.788
Is this coming from the producers

08:26.813 --> 08:28.681
or is this coming from you?

08:28.683 --> 08:31.651
Really, babe?

08:31.653 --> 08:34.086
You and I started this thing.

08:34.087 --> 08:35.344
Come here.

08:38.193 --> 08:40.626
I swear, it's all good.

08:42.464 --> 08:43.796
- Hey, Cotton.
- Hey.

08:43.798 --> 08:44.937
How you doing, beautiful?

08:44.962 --> 08:47.600
- Where the girls at?
- They in the back.

08:47.602 --> 08:49.035
Hey, but you know you
can't go back there.

08:49.037 --> 08:50.085
What?

08:50.110 --> 08:51.871
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh.
You need to turn around

08:51.873 --> 08:53.272
and walk right back out that door.

08:53.274 --> 08:55.641
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

08:55.643 --> 08:56.943
Who is she?

08:57.599 --> 08:59.011
This is my niece.

08:59.013 --> 09:01.347
You know Carlotta don't want you here

09:01.349 --> 09:02.682
when she not around.

09:02.684 --> 09:04.784
What's up?

09:04.809 --> 09:07.624
I thought we weren't rehearsing
till Simone got out of school.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.374
- What's she saying?
- She likes our singing.

09:12.399 --> 09:13.898
Oh, this ain't about rehearsal.

09:13.923 --> 09:15.361
Look, I want to get you all to Sadie's,

09:15.363 --> 09:17.830
'cause there's a couple
of acts that are competing

09:17.832 --> 09:20.419
in the live auditions that
are gonna be there tonight.

09:21.192 --> 09:22.879
What's happening tonight?

09:22.904 --> 09:24.103
Who is she?

09:24.105 --> 09:26.572
- His niece.
- His niece.

09:26.574 --> 09:28.007
Jahil's taking us to a club tonight

09:28.009 --> 09:29.909
to check out the competition,

09:29.911 --> 09:31.350
so we're about to go get ready.

09:31.375 --> 09:33.880
Simone isn't going anywhere,
it's a school night.

09:33.882 --> 09:36.349
Bad day.

09:36.351 --> 09:38.251
Hey, Lottie, check this out.

09:38.253 --> 09:40.853
You know, since I been pulling
the girls away from the salon,

09:40.855 --> 09:43.356
I thought maybe I'd bring
someone in, help you out.

09:43.358 --> 09:44.557
- Your niece?
- Yeah.

09:44.559 --> 09:45.725
I mean, the girls told me

09:45.727 --> 09:47.326
that you need help around here,

09:47.328 --> 09:49.629
and Eva used to do hair
in the Dominican Republic,

09:49.631 --> 09:52.131
so maybe she could help
you out while we rehearse.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.467
I'm not running a school
for wayward girls here.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.035
Hey, look, those girls,
they need to put in the work

09:56.037 --> 09:59.338
to make it to the next round, so...

10:00.947 --> 10:03.013
She could sweep floors,

10:03.038 --> 10:05.706
but Simone stays.

You killed it up there. Beautiful.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.787
Thanks. Y'all up next?

11:54.789 --> 11:58.691
Uh, no, we're, uh, we're
just spectating tonight, so...

11:58.693 --> 12:00.359
Oh, I mean, I get it.

12:00.361 --> 12:02.962
I wouldn't want to have to
follow after us, either, so...

12:02.964 --> 12:05.164
Don't push it, sweetheart.

12:05.166 --> 12:07.667
We're just saving up
for Atlanta NextFest.

12:07.669 --> 12:09.835
Cute. But to win Atlanta NextFest,

12:09.837 --> 12:12.505
you got to get through us, so...

12:14.516 --> 12:16.475
Who sings the national anthem at a club?

12:16.477 --> 12:18.144
That's all I'm trying to figure out.

12:18.146 --> 12:19.345
Don't worry about it.

12:19.347 --> 12:20.904
They got faces for radio.

12:24.239 --> 12:27.942
- Ugh. And they got a blonde one!
- Okay.

12:27.944 --> 12:30.178
We need to change up our song.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.280
- You think?
- I'm just saying.

12:32.282 --> 12:35.650
These girls have 200,000
Instagram and Twitter followers.

12:35.652 --> 12:36.951
We don't even have a name.

12:36.953 --> 12:39.954
I could have Simone
set up some accounts.

12:39.956 --> 12:42.357
Well, you think she's up for it?

12:42.359 --> 12:44.592
Yeah. Now that we got
rid of her foster dad,

12:44.617 --> 12:46.817
she should be able to do something.

12:48.031 --> 12:50.932
Look, let's just figure
out a song, all right?

12:50.934 --> 12:54.102
Did you kill him?

12:54.104 --> 12:55.904
You could tell me.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.956
How could I kill that big-ass man?

12:58.981 --> 13:01.148
I don't know. I tried, too.

13:01.998 --> 13:05.246
Whatever song we do at these
auditions, we have to kill it.

13:05.248 --> 13:07.282
Well, we'll look good if
you let Cotton do her job

13:07.284 --> 13:08.883
and stop being mean.

13:08.885 --> 13:10.342
That bitch can do with $20

13:10.367 --> 13:12.095
what you can't do
with your credit cards.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.621
And what she can't buy, she'll steal.

13:13.623 --> 13:15.323
- She can give us a look.
- All right.

13:15.325 --> 13:17.992
Well, these live
auditions are in two days.

13:17.994 --> 13:19.961
That's cutting it close.

13:19.963 --> 13:23.031
Dude, we made our demo in a loony bin.

13:23.033 --> 13:24.866
We could do anything, girl.

13:26.670 --> 13:30.071
Well, you know, sister
Jenkins just had a stroke.

13:30.073 --> 13:31.806
Mm.

13:31.808 --> 13:34.542
I need you to step in
as the choir director.

13:38.615 --> 13:41.082
You're-you're here all time,

13:41.084 --> 13:43.351
and, you know, I'll get
to see you more often.

13:43.353 --> 13:45.086
I think it'll be beautiful.

13:45.088 --> 13:47.755
You trying to have everybody talking.

13:47.757 --> 13:49.757
They already talking, baby.

13:49.759 --> 13:52.293
It's what they do.

13:52.295 --> 13:55.163
No, I-I got so much going on right now

13:55.165 --> 13:58.833
with Simone and them
girls and the salon.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.469
What's going on?

14:08.842 --> 14:11.376
Nothing, Bobby.

14:13.183 --> 14:15.917
I'm fine just being part of the choir.

14:15.919 --> 14:19.153
I just got too much
on my plate right now.

14:19.155 --> 14:21.522
Well, I'm-a pray on it.

14:27.335 --> 14:28.730
Well?

14:28.732 --> 14:30.832
That's not it.

14:30.834 --> 14:33.268
We sang "Break Your Chest" once
and got booed off the stage.

14:33.270 --> 14:35.003
I'm not trying to do that again.

14:35.005 --> 14:37.282
All right, you think you
can do better, let's hear it.

14:37.307 --> 14:38.172
I've got a song.

14:38.174 --> 14:39.474
You don't have to get personal about it.

14:39.476 --> 14:40.775
We can work on it together.

14:40.777 --> 14:42.143
- I've got a song.
- I'm just saying

14:42.145 --> 14:44.412
all I've been hearing are
complaints and no suggestions.

14:44.414 --> 14:46.781
Maybe if you stopped texting
Hunter, we could focus on

14:46.783 --> 14:48.483
- what we need to do.
- Okay, maybe if y'all

14:48.485 --> 14:50.318
shut up for a little
bit and listen to me,

14:50.320 --> 14:52.520
you would've heard me
when I said I got a song.

14:54.391 --> 14:55.923
All right, let's hear it.

14:55.925 --> 14:57.892
I honestly didn't even
know you were there.

14:57.894 --> 14:59.460
Yeah, of course you didn't.

15:12.108 --> 15:14.242

we're not doing it.

17:04.528 --> 17:06.428
I loved it.

17:11.669 --> 17:13.535

17:13.537 --> 17:15.871
Eh, um...

17:15.873 --> 17:17.638
l-lots of salons

17:17.641 --> 17:18.973
where I'm from.

17:18.976 --> 17:20.509
Oh, so you understand us.

17:20.511 --> 17:22.644
You just don't speak it that well.

17:22.646 --> 17:26.214
Is that why you came here
to America, for a job?

17:26.215 --> 17:29.818
Um, mi mamá, um...

17:29.820 --> 17:31.586
she came here

17:31.588 --> 17:33.622
15 years ago.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.960
What is she talking about?

17:38.962 --> 17:40.662
That was the last time she ever saw her.

17:43.966 --> 17:45.632
Cool, looks great.

17:45.657 --> 17:47.891
- You done?
- Sí.

17:50.140 --> 17:51.707
Good luck finding your mama.

17:51.709 --> 17:53.742
Star, you're so damn rude.

17:53.744 --> 17:56.211
I gave her a tip. Please.

17:56.213 --> 17:58.413
Did I do some something wrong?

17:58.415 --> 18:01.483
No, that's just Star.

18:01.485 --> 18:04.486
We're not doing it.

18:04.488 --> 18:05.987
Stop, yo.

18:05.989 --> 18:09.224
You better be at rehearsal at 7:00.

18:11.314 --> 18:13.195
We got so much work to do

18:13.197 --> 18:14.596
for these live auditions still.

18:14.598 --> 18:17.899
Oh, yeah, some girl
group named Glamour's

18:17.901 --> 18:19.901
pretty good, right?

18:19.903 --> 18:22.437
Yeah. Glamour.

18:22.439 --> 18:23.872
How do you know that?

18:23.874 --> 18:28.210
Jahil. He's all psyched up about you.

18:28.212 --> 18:30.712
How do you feel about him?

18:30.714 --> 18:32.814
Got him on a leash.

18:32.816 --> 18:34.449
But if we have any chance at all,

18:34.451 --> 18:36.282
we can't be walking
in there looking like

18:36.307 --> 18:37.319
American Idol rejects.

18:37.321 --> 18:39.988
He has to get it right on
the money flow for real.

18:39.990 --> 18:41.356
We got to have enough for Cotton

18:41.358 --> 18:43.892
to work with to make us look good.

18:45.062 --> 18:46.561
It's not even all that.

18:46.563 --> 18:48.630
All that's extra.

18:48.632 --> 18:50.399
I just want to sing.

18:50.401 --> 18:53.735
That's how I feel about football.

18:53.737 --> 18:56.371
You know, I loved it 'cause
it got me out of the house.

18:57.474 --> 18:59.141
At least you had a house.

18:59.143 --> 19:01.376
And a family.

19:06.677 --> 19:08.577
My dad's in jail.

19:09.787 --> 19:13.255
Last time I saw him, I was 12.

19:13.257 --> 19:15.957
He used me as a shield in a shootout.

19:20.145 --> 19:21.511
Damn.

19:25.002 --> 19:28.637
Nah, wasn't that bad.

19:30.707 --> 19:33.375
Must be why you're so
tight with your mom.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.979
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

19:37.981 --> 19:40.215
What, you think you're
gonna pay for this?

19:41.685 --> 19:44.453
Hey...

19:44.455 --> 19:45.954
Take this.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.724
You sure you want to
give me your credit card?

19:50.694 --> 19:51.827
Can I trust you?

19:51.829 --> 19:54.396
Absolutely.

19:55.466 --> 19:57.165
And tell Cotton to buy you something

19:57.167 --> 20:00.101
so that you can murder
in those auditions.

20:09.213 --> 20:10.612
Hey, man, it's me.

20:10.614 --> 20:11.813
Just checking in to
see if you had a minute

20:11.815 --> 20:13.315
to check out that demo.

20:13.317 --> 20:15.116
Hit me back.

20:16.353 --> 20:17.719
Where's Star?

20:17.721 --> 20:19.421
Out with Hunter.

20:19.423 --> 20:21.590
She knows we only got this
place for a couple hours, right?

20:21.592 --> 20:23.343
Yeah, we can do it without her, though.

20:23.368 --> 20:24.526
Just fill her in later.

20:24.528 --> 20:25.560
We can't do it without her.

20:25.562 --> 20:26.928
She's the lead.

20:27.761 --> 20:29.761
Since when?

20:29.786 --> 20:31.967
Since we need to bring
something fresh, all right?

20:31.969 --> 20:33.702
To get over on these other girls.

20:33.704 --> 20:35.570
Someone like Star singing R&B

20:35.572 --> 20:36.905
gives us an edge.

20:36.907 --> 20:38.340
You mean because she's white.

20:38.342 --> 20:40.242
What, you think I'm stupid?

20:40.244 --> 20:41.910
I didn't choose her
because she was white.

20:41.912 --> 20:43.278
I chose her because of her voice.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.579
Yeah, and that was a smart decision.

20:44.581 --> 20:45.881
Now make another one.

20:45.883 --> 20:47.349
Let Star sing the lead on this,

20:47.351 --> 20:48.884
and you're guaranteed to win.

20:48.886 --> 20:50.485
Why isn't she picking up her phone?

20:50.487 --> 20:52.487
Did you guys do something
to piss her off or something?

20:52.489 --> 20:54.990
You're ridiculous.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.859
She got bent out of shape
over a tape Simone found.

20:57.861 --> 20:59.528
What tape?

20:59.530 --> 21:01.029
It was a video of my mother singing.

21:01.031 --> 21:02.914
- What was the song?
- Something about

21:02.939 --> 21:04.632
unloving... I don't know.

21:04.657 --> 21:06.768
It sounded personal, but it was fire.

21:06.770 --> 21:09.137
I think we should sing
it for live auditions.

21:11.041 --> 21:14.042
Why did my mom and Miss
Carlotta stop singing?

21:14.044 --> 21:16.778
It was a lot of things.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.283
Ask Carlotta.

21:18.308 --> 21:19.714
Well, I'm asking you.

21:19.716 --> 21:20.782
You were their manager.

21:20.784 --> 21:22.350
Now you're managing us.

21:22.352 --> 21:24.112
What did you do to make
the group fall apart?

21:25.155 --> 21:26.655
I didn't do a damn thing, all right?

21:26.657 --> 21:28.323
I handled my business.

21:28.325 --> 21:29.958
I had them all lined
up for a European tour.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.393
Everything was cool, and then...

21:31.395 --> 21:32.894
And then what?

21:32.896 --> 21:35.630
Carlotta got jealous of Mary.

21:35.632 --> 21:37.599
All right? Jealous of your mom.

21:37.601 --> 21:39.783
She screwed it up, not me.

21:43.106 --> 21:46.308
Let's get that process on the fly, okay?

21:46.310 --> 21:48.476
I'm gonna try this number.

21:49.880 --> 21:51.432
Hello?

21:51.457 --> 21:52.379
Mrs. Leecan?

21:52.404 --> 21:54.950
This is Detective Belkin from
the Atlanta Police Department.

21:54.952 --> 21:56.918
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

21:56.920 --> 22:00.021
We found his rental car here.

22:01.624 --> 22:07.073

22:18.120 --> 22:20.587
Who wants to go shoppin'?

22:20.589 --> 22:22.522
What the hell happened
to you last night?

22:22.524 --> 22:23.990
I got us a credit card.

22:23.992 --> 22:25.116
Wow.

22:25.141 --> 22:27.661
I'm sure you went through
multiple orgasms pimping us

22:27.663 --> 22:29.262
before he gave it to you.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.598
Unless you stole it.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.166
You stole it, didn't you?

22:33.168 --> 22:35.150
You stole his credit card?

22:35.175 --> 22:37.237
No, actually, I didn't.

22:37.239 --> 22:39.272
Why do you always think the worst of me?

22:39.274 --> 22:41.374
Wow.

22:41.376 --> 22:44.210
You make Madonna look
like Cinderella, don't you?

22:44.938 --> 22:48.090
He said we could get whatever
we needed for the live auditions.

22:48.115 --> 22:51.284
I'm gonna go tell Cotton.

22:56.174 --> 22:58.107
Who them flowers for?

22:59.511 --> 23:01.178
Oh, they for you, C.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.733
Special delivery.

23:12.374 --> 23:13.607
That's nice.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.803
Who are they from?

23:15.828 --> 23:17.761
Pastor Harris.

23:18.947 --> 23:20.480
So?

23:20.482 --> 23:22.282
He can't...? Why he can get me flowers?

23:22.284 --> 23:23.850
We ain't no secret.

23:23.852 --> 23:26.820
Hate to break the news to
you, but you sort of are.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.555
I mean, just 'cause we know...

23:28.557 --> 23:29.956
Chatter don't
mean them old biddies

23:29.958 --> 23:31.257
down there at that church don't know.

23:31.259 --> 23:32.597
I can't stand them. They so nosy.

23:32.622 --> 23:34.389
That's why I don't fool with that place.

23:34.414 --> 23:37.998
You know Pastor Harris
asked me to direct the choir.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.200
I told him I'll think about it,

23:40.202 --> 23:42.035
but he ain't gonna
take no for an answer.

23:42.037 --> 23:43.637
Look, all I'm saying is

23:43.639 --> 23:46.039
we need to pay homage to
the girl groups of the '90s

23:46.041 --> 23:47.407
and give it that fresh flavor.

23:47.409 --> 23:48.975
That's hot, that's different,

23:48.977 --> 23:50.644
that's our signature piece.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.712
I know you ain't boosting again.

23:52.714 --> 23:54.714
Like you even care.

23:54.716 --> 23:57.450
This is Hunter's card.

23:57.452 --> 24:00.687
He said we could pick up some
stuff for the live auditions.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.690
I might've gone a little crazy.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.959
That conversation we were
having ain't hardly done.

24:05.961 --> 24:07.460
Right.

24:07.462 --> 24:10.630
We need to agree on a song
that we can compete with.

24:11.778 --> 24:13.578
I'm not singing my mother's song.

24:14.306 --> 24:16.536
It's the one.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.339
It's dope in all the right places.

24:19.341 --> 24:22.742
Get over the issues with your mother.

24:22.744 --> 24:26.713
I know it's easier said
than done, but just do it.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.988
I hate her, Alex.

24:29.013 --> 24:31.317
I hate how she left us,

24:31.319 --> 24:34.554
and I'm not trying to
sing one of her songs.

24:34.556 --> 24:37.524
Quit pushing me.

24:50.205 --> 24:51.738
You okay?

24:51.740 --> 24:54.674
Why does everything have
to be a fight with her?

24:54.676 --> 24:56.094
'Cause that's all she's ever known.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.752
She don't know how to do nothing else.

24:58.870 --> 25:00.814
Well, if we're ever
gonna make it as a group,

25:00.816 --> 25:02.048
she needs to get it together.

25:02.050 --> 25:04.217
That's why there ain't no girl groups.

25:04.219 --> 25:06.920
It's always one.

25:12.027 --> 25:14.994
So, who came up with the
group name, Mixed Harmony?

25:14.996 --> 25:17.097
You or Mary?

25:17.099 --> 25:18.264
Jahil.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.936
At rehearsal other
day, he was telling us

25:22.938 --> 25:26.506
how you got jealous of Mary
and that's why the group ended.

25:26.508 --> 25:29.976
I don't believe a word
he says ever, but...

25:29.978 --> 25:31.811
is it true?

25:32.948 --> 25:35.949
Jahil is a lying, coke-snorting pig.

25:35.951 --> 25:39.552
His obsession with
Mary is what ended us.

25:39.554 --> 25:41.488
Next time, ask him
to tell you the truth.

26:10.285 --> 26:11.580
- Yeah.

26:11.605 --> 26:13.620
- Yeah.
- What is that, Cotton?

26:13.645 --> 26:16.122
Girl, never mind that.

26:16.124 --> 26:17.857
Go and apologize.

26:19.751 --> 26:22.595
Why am I always the one
who has to apologize?

26:22.597 --> 26:25.031

always startin' mess.

26:25.033 --> 26:26.533

26:26.535 --> 26:28.568
if there's nothing you can agree on?

26:28.570 --> 26:30.036
Go ask her.

26:30.038 --> 26:32.017
She's the one being
precious about a song.

26:32.042 --> 26:33.541
Then work with her.

26:33.566 --> 26:35.842
There's gonna be plenty
of other things out there

26:35.844 --> 26:37.410

26:37.412 --> 26:39.512

26:39.514 --> 26:41.347
What you give up?

26:47.410 --> 26:48.855
Where you going?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.690
I was just gonna check out the outfits.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.358
You finish your homework?

26:52.360 --> 26:54.027
Half of it.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.261
Okay, well, march yourself back

26:55.263 --> 26:57.363
down there and finish the other half.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.499

26:59.501 --> 27:01.801
Look, if this music
thing don't work out,

27:01.803 --> 27:03.870
you need something to fall back on.

27:06.341 --> 27:09.776

were gonna do that song?

32:41.863 --> 32:42.962
No. I didn't.

32:42.964 --> 32:44.096
I mean, what they did with it

32:44.098 --> 32:45.965
was amazing, and Star,

32:45.967 --> 32:48.734
I mean, she got that same
"it" quality that Mary had.

32:48.736 --> 32:51.357
Alexandra arranged that song, not Star.

32:51.382 --> 32:53.706
Oh, yeah, no. Of course.
But-but Star's vocal?

32:53.708 --> 32:55.141
And those lyrics.

32:55.143 --> 32:56.842
It totally reminds me
of why I fell so hard

32:56.844 --> 32:58.778
for Mary. I mean...

32:58.780 --> 33:01.714
After all these years,

33:01.716 --> 33:03.015
you still don't get it.

33:03.017 --> 33:04.317
What you mean?

33:04.319 --> 33:07.286
I wrote that song, not Mary.

33:09.123 --> 33:10.990
Don't worry. It wasn't about you.

33:12.757 --> 33:15.394
Okay, don't be mad at Simone.

33:15.396 --> 33:17.296
It was my idea.

33:17.321 --> 33:19.465
Mama did have a great voice.

33:19.467 --> 33:21.500
The song was beautiful.

33:21.502 --> 33:23.202
She'd be very proud of you.

33:25.707 --> 33:27.974
Don't keep her out too late.

33:27.976 --> 33:30.710
Ooh! Girl...

33:30.712 --> 33:32.278
You all killed it!

33:32.280 --> 33:33.746
Mwah. I told you

33:33.748 --> 33:35.781
all that hard work was
gonna pay off, right?

33:35.783 --> 33:37.016
Yeah. Sure.

33:37.018 --> 33:38.751
Yeah, we did it as a group.

33:38.753 --> 33:41.594
Okay. Okay, now listen. I
saw a music contact of mine

33:41.619 --> 33:43.611
in the crowd. I'm-a be
right back, real quick.

33:43.636 --> 33:44.902
All right.

33:48.463 --> 33:49.996
Hey. Yo, Frank.

33:49.998 --> 33:52.665
Yo, Frank!

34:01.175 --> 34:03.275
Get off!

34:03.277 --> 34:05.111
Get off me!

34:15.487 --> 34:18.155
Y'all were fire last night.

34:18.179 --> 34:21.648
Yeah, but Alex did a great
job of updating the song.

34:22.632 --> 34:24.686
And thank you, Cott,
for making us look hot.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.721
Thank you. You got style.

34:26.723 --> 34:28.489
You do.

34:28.492 --> 34:31.793
Mm-hmm. You do.

34:31.795 --> 34:33.828
Oh, my God. You guys...

34:33.830 --> 34:35.230
- What?
- Guess what?

34:35.232 --> 34:36.931
We made it to the top 20.

34:36.934 --> 34:38.065
- We're finalists!
- Are you serious?

34:38.068 --> 34:39.701
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God!

34:39.703 --> 34:41.603
- I'm so excited...
- We did it!

34:41.605 --> 34:42.904
What?

34:42.906 --> 34:45.072
Wait. Hold up.

34:46.376 --> 34:49.277
God's Blessings. Can
you call back tomorrow?

34:49.279 --> 34:51.179
Simone. Have you seen your father?

34:51.181 --> 34:54.181
He left a couple weeks ago to
come get you and bring you back,

34:54.184 --> 34:56.284
and I-I've... no one's seen him since,

34:56.286 --> 35:00.188
and I'm really worried. I-It...

35:12.602 --> 35:14.269
We could see
something, right here.

35:14.271 --> 35:15.904
Don't answer it.

35:15.906 --> 35:19.040
Just let it go to voice
mail. It's the bill collector.

35:19.042 --> 35:20.475
Okay.

35:20.477 --> 35:22.978
We did it!

35:39.796 --> 35:41.563
Oh...

35:54.077 --> 35:56.211
That was so worth the wait.

35:56.213 --> 35:57.912
Yeah, I told you it would be.

36:01.885 --> 36:04.819
We did it.

36:04.821 --> 36:06.921
We made it through to the next round.

36:06.923 --> 36:08.857
That's great. Congrats.

36:08.859 --> 36:10.558
Thanks, babe.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.360
You ready for the next round?

36:12.362 --> 36:14.462
Am I ready for the next round?

36:21.338 --> 36:24.339
You want to join?

36:24.341 --> 36:26.039
Mom!

36:26.064 --> 36:28.043
So I'm working on your finances,

36:28.045 --> 36:30.111
and I see $20,000 spent

36:30.113 --> 36:33.681
on a high-end fashion boutique.

36:33.683 --> 36:37.052
Yeah. It was pretty cute stuff.

36:37.054 --> 36:39.387
I told you to get a few things.

36:39.389 --> 36:42.390
- Oh.
- Not buy out the whole place.

36:42.392 --> 36:46.694
You lent your card to this...

36:46.696 --> 36:48.196
dirty thong?

36:48.198 --> 36:49.798
- Let me tell you something...
- Mom!

36:49.800 --> 36:51.199
- Get out. Mom!
- Listen to me.

36:51.201 --> 36:52.921
Get out.

36:52.946 --> 36:54.712
Please.

37:06.316 --> 37:08.683
We may have bought a few more things

37:08.685 --> 37:12.187
than you expected, but it's
three girls, and it's 20K.

37:12.189 --> 37:14.289
That's a drop in the bucket for
you. You're not gonna miss it.

37:14.291 --> 37:15.623
That's not the point.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.125
I asked if I could trust you.

37:17.127 --> 37:19.027
And I asked if you were sure you wanted

37:19.029 --> 37:21.696
to give me your credit card.

37:55.799 --> 37:58.066
Amen. Good morning.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.601
Good morning.

37:59.603 --> 38:02.504
We are lifting the
family of Sister Jenkins

38:02.506 --> 38:04.272
up in prayer. Amen.

38:04.274 --> 38:05.607
Amen.

38:05.609 --> 38:07.709
In her absence,

38:07.711 --> 38:12.080
Sister Carlotta will be
stepping in to lead the choir.

38:18.288 --> 38:20.121
Anything for Sister Jenkins,

38:20.123 --> 38:23.377
and Pastor, of course, and all of us.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.826
Amen.
