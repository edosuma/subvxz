<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of four orphans brought together by fate.</i>

00:19.352 --> 00:21.252
<i>They didn't know it yet...</i>

00:21.354 --> 00:24.255
<i>but there was something greater</i>
<i>in store for them-</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:26.325
<i>something epic.</i>

00:44.744 --> 00:47.076
<i>Meet our first orphan- Lucy.</i>

00:47.180 --> 00:50.911
<i>She had been raised by</i>
<i>a kindly old museum curator.</i>

00:51.017 --> 00:52.917
- <i>But alas...</i>
- Ohh!

00:53.019 --> 00:55.385
<i>he was murdered.</i>

01:00.226 --> 01:02.057
Ow.

01:02.162 --> 01:03.891
Oh, please don't die.

01:03.997 --> 01:07.398
Please don't die. You're all I have.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.128
You're on my hand.

01:12.205 --> 01:14.139
Oh, sorry.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.767
It's a code.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.010
But what is it?

01:25.051 --> 01:29.647
Oh, my God! Oh, God!
The code! Please! Give me another clue!

01:31.091 --> 01:33.082
I didn't read the book on tape.

01:38.398 --> 01:41.128
Habeas corpus.
<i>E pluribus unum.</i>

01:42.435 --> 01:44.096
God.
Um, the code, please.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.203
<i>Your body is in the shape</i>
<i>of a letter. Is it the letter "D"?</i>

01:52.312 --> 01:54.542
<i>Please! Please!</i>

01:54.647 --> 01:56.171
Um, that's an "A"!

01:58.618 --> 02:03.988
<i>It's "V"! "V"! Uh, "I"! "I"!</i>

02:07.894 --> 02:09.622
Um, "N"!

02:09.729 --> 02:12.095
Uh- Um-

02:13.733 --> 02:16.998
Um, "I"-

02:17.103 --> 02:20.402
Oh! "C"! "C"!
"I-C"!

02:22.475 --> 02:26.468
"I"! "I."
Da-Da-Da- Da Vinci!

02:27.780 --> 02:30.044
Right!

02:30.150 --> 02:32.710
<i>Oh, God. Oh.</i>

02:32.819 --> 02:35.344
Oh.

02:36.456 --> 02:39.823
"So lame the hair of Tom."

02:44.364 --> 02:46.264
Wait. "Lame."

02:46.366 --> 02:48.266
"Lame" is a-

02:48.368 --> 02:51.201
"Lame" is a seven-letter word.

02:54.874 --> 02:57.570
The code is seven!
Right!

03:17.463 --> 03:19.522
Oh, thank-

03:24.938 --> 03:27.304
Right.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.905
<i>Then there was</i>
<i>our next orphan, Edward.</i>

03:37.016 --> 03:41.646
<i>He was living in a Mexican monastery</i>
<i>with all the other children.</i>

03:48.895 --> 03:51.591
I'm not eating that.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.066
Be grateful, Eduardo.

03:55.168 --> 03:58.001
Today I made something
especially scrumptious.

04:09.215 --> 04:13.413
Nacho!

04:13.519 --> 04:19.355
Nacho!

04:19.459 --> 04:24.487
Nacho!

04:26.966 --> 04:33.769
Nacho...

04:33.873 --> 04:39.277
Nacho...

04:39.379 --> 04:42.678
cheese flavored Doritos are delicious!

04:48.054 --> 04:50.022
Ah-choo!

04:56.429 --> 04:58.727
I'm sick of this!

04:58.831 --> 05:02.028
I'm going to be
a <i>lucha libre</i> wrestler.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.836
You think you are better
than the other orphans?

05:06.939 --> 05:09.635
- Yes.
- Chanchito!

05:09.742 --> 05:13.735
<i>Come. Teach him a lesson</i>
<i>in humility.</i>

05:25.158 --> 05:27.558
You gotta be kidding me.

05:32.799 --> 05:35.495
You like the flavor
of the beans going up your nose?

05:38.838 --> 05:41.398
Just take his arm
and spin it around!

05:41.507 --> 05:45.375
Chanchito, throw him off the table.

05:53.886 --> 05:56.684
Sweet!

05:56.789 --> 05:59.280
And stay out, <i>cabr√≥n</i>!

06:10.069 --> 06:11.969
<i>Our next orphan, Susan...</i>

06:12.071 --> 06:16.269
<i>was on her way to Namibia to</i>
<i>meet her new adoptive parents.</i>

06:21.748 --> 06:24.581
- Can I get you a cocktail?
- Just some water.

06:24.684 --> 06:27.278
Okay.
What can I get you to drink?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.412
<i>More juice, please.</i>

07:10.296 --> 07:13.265
I chose the wrong day to fly!

07:15.735 --> 07:17.703
Enough is enough!

07:17.804 --> 07:21.672
I've had it with these motherfuckin'
snakes on this motherfuckin' plane!

07:21.774 --> 07:24.174
- So have I!
- <i>Enough is enough!</i>

07:24.277 --> 07:28.179
I've had it with these motherfuckin'
snakes on this motherfuckin' plane!

07:28.281 --> 07:30.943
- Right!
- I've had it...

07:31.050 --> 07:33.951
<i>with these motherfuckin' snakes</i>
<i>on this motherfuckin' plane!</i>

07:34.053 --> 07:36.021
Why do you keep saying that?

07:36.122 --> 07:39.023
Because Internet bloggers
love it when I say...

07:39.125 --> 07:42.617
I've had it with these motherfuckin'
snakes on this motherfuckin' plane!

07:42.728 --> 07:45.526
All right.
We get it already. Okay?

07:45.631 --> 07:48.566
No, I don't think you do!

07:48.668 --> 07:52.570
<i>I've had it with these motherfuckin'</i>
<i>snakes on this motherfuckin' plane!</i>

07:52.672 --> 07:56.130
- Why are you yelling?
- Shit, bitch, I'm <i>always</i> yellin'!

07:56.242 --> 07:58.540
I'm Samuel motherfuckin' Jackson!

07:58.644 --> 08:00.544
Bitch?

08:05.985 --> 08:09.045
- The designer understands these things.
- Darling, you look great.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.392
I'm so hot.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.842
Yes!

08:42.020 --> 08:43.921
<i>And finally...</i>

08:44.023 --> 08:45.923
<i>our last orphan, Peter.</i>

08:46.025 --> 08:50.394
<i>He made his home among</i>
<i>the undesirables of society- the mutants.</i>

08:50.496 --> 08:53.932
<i>But even there he was an outcast.</i>

09:36.409 --> 09:39.276
Hi, Mystique.
Hi, L.C.

09:41.914 --> 09:45.475
Right, um, so, anyway,
I was wondering...

09:45.585 --> 09:48.986
would you like to come
to the homecoming dance with me?

09:51.457 --> 09:53.425
As if.

10:09.575 --> 10:11.304
Nice hair, Rogue.

10:15.815 --> 10:18.716
You talkin' to my girl...

10:18.818 --> 10:20.786
numbnuts?

10:28.894 --> 10:31.055
Asshole.

10:50.116 --> 10:54.246
- <i>Fight. Fight. Fight.</i>
- Fight! Fight!

10:54.353 --> 10:56.184
What are you gonna do about it?

11:00.326 --> 11:02.920
He's unleashing his powers!

11:05.798 --> 11:07.766
He's gonna spread angel wings!

11:19.612 --> 11:21.705
More like chicken wings!

11:26.986 --> 11:30.183
<i>Break it up.</i>
<i>Break it up.</i>

11:30.289 --> 11:35.522
You all know Peter is too much
of a pussy to stand up for himself.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.376
Aah!

12:09.028 --> 12:10.996
<i>And for these four orphans...</i>

12:11.097 --> 12:14.157
<i>life would never be the same.</i>

12:34.053 --> 12:36.385
Gross.

12:52.638 --> 12:55.869
<i>Welcome.</i>

12:55.975 --> 12:59.775
<i>You</i> must be Susan.

12:59.879 --> 13:03.542
And you... are Peter.

13:05.084 --> 13:08.144
And you're Edward.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.812
And you-

13:13.225 --> 13:15.386
You're Lucy.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.629
I've been expecting you.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.529
So, come on!

13:21.634 --> 13:23.932
Ooh!

13:49.962 --> 13:52.760
I love your legendary candy.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.824
A chocolate river!

14:01.307 --> 14:03.571
Mmm!

14:06.145 --> 14:08.079
It's delicious!

14:11.383 --> 14:13.681
It's so delicious!

14:18.157 --> 14:20.022
Yea!

14:25.331 --> 14:28.960
Chocolate!

14:29.068 --> 14:30.968
That's, uh-

14:31.070 --> 14:33.732
- That's actually the sewer line. Yeah.
- <i>It's delic-</i>

14:43.082 --> 14:45.642
<i>Children, do you want to know...</i>

14:45.751 --> 14:49.312
what makes all my candy
taste so special?

14:49.421 --> 14:51.753
Uh-huh.

14:51.857 --> 14:54.553
It's a special, secret ingredient.

14:54.660 --> 14:59.063
It's real human parts.

14:59.164 --> 15:02.827
There's gonna be a little itty-bitty piece
of each and every one of you...

15:02.935 --> 15:06.063
inside of the Yummy Yum candy-
literally.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.605
I'm gettin' out of here.

15:10.442 --> 15:13.240
Let us out, freak!

15:13.345 --> 15:15.279
Let us out, freak!

15:15.381 --> 15:18.077
No, no.
I can't do that.

15:18.183 --> 15:20.117
- Yes, you can.
- Yes, you can.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.948
You're... mine now.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.276
Aah!

16:07.399 --> 16:09.458
Aah!

16:31.156 --> 16:33.386
Stop! Let me go!

16:56.348 --> 16:58.244
Ow!

16:58.350 --> 17:01.251
Aah!

17:03.655 --> 17:05.885
What are you doing?

17:05.991 --> 17:09.757
- Willy told me he wanted his knob polished.
- Dumb-ass.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.729
We've gotta get out of here.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.560
- We gotta get out of here.
- I just said that.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.568
You just said that.

17:18.670 --> 17:22.299
Where are we gonna go?
I don't have a home to go back to.

17:22.407 --> 17:24.933
I thought this golden ticket
was my lucky break.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.569
The curator was all I had.

17:27.679 --> 17:31.080
I never had anyone.
I raised myself.

17:31.183 --> 17:34.641
And that's why you have
such a tough exterior?

17:34.753 --> 17:36.812
Yeah.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.947
And you're kinda bitchy.

17:40.492 --> 17:43.825
- Why us?
- Because we're four kids nobody would ever miss.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.829
We'll be stuck here till we die.

17:45.931 --> 17:48.092
Shut up, Edward.
You're scaring her.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.658
Don't tell me what to do!
You're not my father!

17:51.770 --> 17:54.432
- Two for flinching.
- Oww! Aah!

17:54.540 --> 17:57.270
Leave Peter alone.
He was just sticking up for her.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.179
I can take care of myself.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.908
Like it or not,
we're all in this.

18:07.019 --> 18:09.920
<i>It's obvious we don't like each other,</i>
<i>but if we're going to survive...</i>

18:10.022 --> 18:11.922
we have to stick together.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.753
Aah!

18:17.563 --> 18:21.021
- Ow.
- Was the fight over?

18:22.367 --> 18:24.426
I didn't know.

18:24.536 --> 18:26.436
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Shh! Someone's coming.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.369
<i>Who wants to chew my gum balls?</i>

18:28.474 --> 18:31.204
It's Willy. Hide!

18:48.327 --> 18:50.454
<i>Where are you?</i>

19:05.677 --> 19:08.043
<i>I'm gonna find you.</i>

19:56.094 --> 19:58.062
Wow.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.505
Wow.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.042
Ooh! Oh.

20:22.921 --> 20:25.082
Ooh.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.733
Ooh.

21:27.719 --> 21:31.553
It's stuck.
It's- It's stuck.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.625
It's- It's stuck.

22:01.787 --> 22:03.755
You can do it!

22:09.661 --> 22:11.891
My tongue!

22:13.799 --> 22:15.767
My ba-a-a-a-ad.

22:24.309 --> 22:26.209
Where am I?

22:26.311 --> 22:29.075
The world of Gnarnia.

22:40.158 --> 22:42.058
<i>Oh!</i>

22:42.160 --> 22:45.220
A silent "G," as in "gnome."

22:45.330 --> 22:47.764
Or "gnarly."

22:47.866 --> 22:49.766
- For legal purposes.
- Mm-hmm.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.928
- I'm Mr. Tumnus.
- Oh, my name is Lucy.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.730
What are you?

22:57.042 --> 23:00.205
I'm a faun.
Half man, half goat.

23:02.013 --> 23:05.710
- Oh, so you mean-
- Yeah. Dad screwed a goat.

23:05.817 --> 23:07.808
These are my folks.

23:07.919 --> 23:10.114
<i>Oh!</i>

23:11.390 --> 23:14.086
- You have her goatee.
- Thanks.

23:16.328 --> 23:19.024
- And you?
- Oh. No.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.099
Both of my parents are human.

23:21.199 --> 23:23.827
Eew. Gro-o-o-ss!

23:24.870 --> 23:27.100
Aah- No. Yeah.

23:28.673 --> 23:32.074
So, you are
a daughter of Eve, huh?

23:32.177 --> 23:34.145
Uh-huh.

23:41.386 --> 23:44.480
How rude of me.
Let me show you around.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.921
Oh. Oh! Oh!

23:47.025 --> 23:50.961
<i>I- I-</i>

23:57.102 --> 23:59.502
Welcome to my faun crib.

24:17.155 --> 24:19.521
Come on. Let's go.

24:27.933 --> 24:30.424
Let's see what's in the fridge.

24:32.237 --> 24:34.205
Ooh!
Always gotta have Cristal.

24:36.608 --> 24:39.202
For when Diddy's in the house.
Yo, Diddy!

24:50.489 --> 24:52.389
Say "What's up?" to the honeys.

25:10.909 --> 25:12.877
Check out my plasma.

25:12.978 --> 25:15.378
Say hello to my little friend!

25:16.681 --> 25:19.673
Wanna play us?
Okay. Let's play.

25:20.986 --> 25:23.614
<i>Scarface</i> is the shit!

25:24.656 --> 25:26.453
I'm Tony Fauntana!

25:26.558 --> 25:30.187
You mess with me,
you're messing with the best!

25:33.231 --> 25:38.100
You ain't a true player unless
you got flat screens everywhere.

25:38.203 --> 25:41.104
In the toilet,
when I'm taking a leak.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.231
Say hello to my little friend!

25:44.543 --> 25:47.376
Wanna play us?
Okay, let's play!

25:47.479 --> 25:49.140
This is my favorite part.

25:53.084 --> 25:55.211
Whew!

25:55.320 --> 25:59.450
Under the couch for when
I'm looking for change.

26:02.827 --> 26:05.057
Boo-yah!
Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Ching!

26:05.163 --> 26:08.655
On the top of her head
for when she, you know...

26:09.834 --> 26:11.927
shines my hooves.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.337
So now you all seen my crib.

26:21.446 --> 26:23.812
So get the hell out!

26:25.016 --> 26:27.610
Well, I really should
be getting back.

26:27.719 --> 26:32.349
No, but you, um, must stay.

26:32.457 --> 26:35.358
Oh, Mr. Tumnus,
I'll never forget you.

26:36.561 --> 26:39.155
Please take this
to remember me by.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.467
And I you.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.431
I'm sorry.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.509
Lucy...

26:54.613 --> 26:56.547
you are in danger.

26:56.648 --> 26:59.811
- What are you-
- You must go now.

26:59.918 --> 27:02.318
Oh! What's wrong?

27:02.420 --> 27:04.547
Take this.
It will explain everything.

27:20.338 --> 27:22.863
<i>Confirm identification.</i>

27:22.974 --> 27:24.942
My eyes! My-

27:26.978 --> 27:28.878
Oh.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.971
Well, that's better than LASIK.

27:34.419 --> 27:37.684
The evil White Bitch who rules Gnarnia...

27:37.789 --> 27:42.192
has ordered anyone
who finds a human to turn them in.

27:42.293 --> 27:46.059
I brought you ba-a-a-ack
to my lair to betray you...

27:46.164 --> 27:48.064
but I couldn't do it.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.361
You are a true friend.

27:51.936 --> 27:54.564
She has plunged our
once-peaceful land into eternal winter.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.233
Under her two terms,
we now have...

27:57.342 --> 28:00.573
wiretaps, no gay marriage...

28:00.679 --> 28:04.877
not to mention her bumbling
of the hurricane relief effort.

28:04.983 --> 28:10.444
And-And the White Bitch
doesn't care about black people.

28:12.824 --> 28:15.725
There is a small
resistance movement.

28:15.827 --> 28:19.786
They learned she's developing
a weapon of mass destruction...

28:19.898 --> 28:21.957
that can kill all of us.

28:24.069 --> 28:27.038
Wait, a real W.M.D.,
or, like, a fake Saddam one?

28:27.138 --> 28:29.231
No, a <i>real</i> one.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.274
That sounds bad.

28:32.310 --> 28:33.709
Go now, before she finds you.

28:33.812 --> 28:35.803
- But-
- <i>There's no time to argue.</i>

28:35.914 --> 28:37.313
Go no-o-o-o-ow!

28:37.415 --> 28:40.077
<i>This message</i>
<i>will self-destruct in one second.</i>

28:40.185 --> 28:41.652
Wait-What?

28:50.662 --> 28:53.495
<i>Come out, come out,</i>
<i>wherever you are.</i>

28:58.002 --> 29:00.493
- Lucy?
- <i>Who wants to play with Willy?</i>

29:00.605 --> 29:03.438
Lucy, move over.
I need someplace to hide.

29:04.876 --> 29:07.606
Lucy. Lu-

29:07.712 --> 29:09.942
Who lives here?
Liberace?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.722
Aah!

29:28.600 --> 29:30.625
This is a really big wardrobe.

30:24.622 --> 30:27.022
What a MI LF.

30:33.031 --> 30:35.499
Kneel before the queen!

30:38.369 --> 30:40.337
You're a son of Adam.

30:40.438 --> 30:43.771
A what?
No, I'm Edward.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.775
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
I-

30:45.877 --> 30:48.345
- I was following Lucy into the wardrobe and-
- Lucy?

30:48.446 --> 30:50.914
- How many are in your family?
- No.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.575
Lucy, Peter and Susan
are <i>not</i> my family.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.676
We're all just a bunch of orphans.

30:55.787 --> 30:58.085
The prophecy!

30:58.189 --> 31:01.352
Please.

31:01.459 --> 31:03.893
Let me help you up.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.291
Wow.

31:09.400 --> 31:12.961
- Oh, you must be parched.
- Yes.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.637
<i>Whoa.</i>

31:25.149 --> 31:26.912
Wow. A 40?

31:37.295 --> 31:39.923
- Ah.
- Drink.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.996
Fresh dog piss.
Go ahead.

31:47.105 --> 31:49.437
Yeah!

31:49.540 --> 31:51.940
I love this place.

31:52.043 --> 31:54.443
And this can all be your new home.

31:54.545 --> 31:57.571
With my help, you can be king.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.977
Wha-What? King?

32:03.755 --> 32:06.189
He can't be king-
Oww!

32:06.291 --> 32:08.088
And you would be my queen?

32:12.597 --> 32:14.827
I've never had a girlfriend before.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.367
Oh!

32:24.542 --> 32:26.510
Ah!

32:32.784 --> 32:34.945
How about that?

32:37.088 --> 32:40.182
Oh, but first
I must meet the others.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.351
<i>Why? You're not gonna make</i>
<i>Peter king too, are you?</i>

32:43.461 --> 32:45.895
Oh! No.

32:45.997 --> 32:50.525
But every king
needs subjects to boss around.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.337
But, Your Majesty-

33:00.478 --> 33:03.311
Behold, my white castle.

33:04.582 --> 33:06.482
<i>White Castle?</i>

33:06.584 --> 33:09.485
I feel like I've been there before.

33:09.587 --> 33:13.079
Bring me the others,
and I'll crown you king.

33:14.192 --> 33:16.660
Yes!

33:35.847 --> 33:38.247
Lucy?

33:38.349 --> 33:40.613
Edward!

33:40.718 --> 33:43.209
You went through
the wardrobe too.

33:43.321 --> 33:45.516
- <i>Lucy!</i>
- <i>Lucy!</i>

33:45.623 --> 33:47.682
- <i>Edward!</i>
- Edward?

33:49.627 --> 33:51.618
This is quite a hiding place.

33:51.729 --> 33:54.061
We have to go now.
We're in grave danger.

33:54.165 --> 33:57.225
Oh, no, no. We should stay right here.
What's the hurry, Lucy?

33:57.335 --> 33:59.235
I mean, they just got here.

33:59.337 --> 34:01.032
Hey, look!
I'm spelling my name!

34:03.708 --> 34:06.472
- Mm-mmm.
- Please!

34:06.577 --> 34:09.045
We have to go.
Mr. Tumnus told me.

34:09.147 --> 34:11.581
Mr. Tumnus?
Who the bloody hell's that?

34:11.681 --> 34:14.549
I love Sudoku!

34:17.388 --> 34:19.253
He's a goat-man...

34:19.357 --> 34:21.222
and he warned of great peril!

34:21.324 --> 34:23.225
- Oh, Lucy.
- Fine!

34:23.327 --> 34:26.728
If you think I'm lying,
just go ask him yourself!

34:26.831 --> 34:28.422
Hmph.

34:31.735 --> 34:34.261
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

34:36.641 --> 34:39.007
Hey, look!
Nicole Richie!

34:39.110 --> 34:41.408
<i>Mm-mmm.</i>

34:55.793 --> 34:57.454
Mr. Tumnus?

35:01.032 --> 35:03.125
Shit.
I know what happened.

35:03.234 --> 35:05.634
- What the hell is that thing?
- It's a talking beaver!

35:05.736 --> 35:07.533
- Holy shit!
- Get it outta here!

35:07.638 --> 35:10.368
No!
Motherf-

35:16.881 --> 35:20.339
<i>Something in my groin tells me</i>
<i>you're not used to a talking beaver.</i>

35:20.451 --> 35:22.851
My name is Harry Beaver.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.383
Mr. Tumnus is my life partner.

35:27.492 --> 35:29.289
<i>Mmm. Sweet man.</i>

35:31.629 --> 35:34.154
Mr. Tumnus was taken
by the White Bitch.

35:34.265 --> 35:36.699
She's hot-
I mean, never heard of her.

35:36.801 --> 35:40.794
The evil ruler. She arrested
Mr. Tumnus for hiding a human.

35:40.905 --> 35:43.169
Is there anything
we can do to help?

35:43.274 --> 35:45.174
Uh, yes.
You must go to Aslo.

35:45.276 --> 35:48.040
He's waiting for you
at the Ancient Table.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.877
- Who's Aslo?
- Who's Aslo?

35:51.983 --> 35:53.644
He's the true king of Gnarnia.

35:53.751 --> 35:56.379
- Not for long.
- <i>Hello? The prophecy?</i>

35:56.487 --> 36:01.151
The four of you will join Aslo and lead
the resistance to destroy the White Bitch.

36:01.259 --> 36:03.386
- Us?
- <i>Yes. You're all heroes.</i>

36:03.494 --> 36:05.519
Especially you, Peter.

36:05.630 --> 36:10.192
<i>My son,</i>
<i>I have sent you to Earth for a reason.</i>

36:10.301 --> 36:12.496
<i>You will be the savior</i>
<i>of all mankind.</i>

36:17.141 --> 36:19.609
<i>You are truly invincible.</i>

36:31.889 --> 36:35.791
Oh, my God! You shot me
in the fucking eye! That really hurts!

36:35.893 --> 36:40.091
Why would you do that?
That was so unnecessary! You bastard!

36:46.704 --> 36:49.696
- But I can't be.
"But I can't be." Why him?

36:49.807 --> 36:53.243
Well, maybe not Superman,
but a hero all the same.

36:53.344 --> 36:55.312
It's your destiny.

36:59.150 --> 37:01.983
<i>Do you think you were</i>
<i>all brought together by chance?</i>

37:02.086 --> 37:05.249
Look at the clues.
They're all around you.

37:13.331 --> 37:15.993
Oh, that's nice.

37:30.114 --> 37:32.082
We're all in the painting.

37:36.354 --> 37:38.083
But what does it mean?

37:49.433 --> 37:51.401
Right.

37:55.239 --> 37:57.400
It's a "cryptix."

37:57.508 --> 37:59.976
The curator taught me
how to decipher these.

38:05.916 --> 38:07.975
Upsy-daisy.

38:19.897 --> 38:21.865
Be careful.

38:32.109 --> 38:34.839
Well, what is it?

38:34.945 --> 38:36.708
It's our birth certificates.

38:39.550 --> 38:43.680
We all have the same last name
and the same parents.

38:47.091 --> 38:49.491
- I don't get it.
- You're all related!

38:50.695 --> 38:52.595
Brothers and sisters.

38:52.697 --> 38:54.995
You're a family, for Christ sakes!

38:56.600 --> 38:59.660
- Sorry.
- Is it really true?

38:59.770 --> 39:02.762
None of us ever had
a real family before.

39:02.873 --> 39:05.706
None of us ever had a real family before.

39:05.810 --> 39:09.007
<i>It's true.</i>
<i>You're quadruplets.</i>

39:09.113 --> 39:12.605
- But our parents-
- Killed by the White Bitch.

39:12.717 --> 39:17.882
<i>Then she separated the four of you</i>
<i>so the prophecy would never be fulfilled.</i>

39:20.124 --> 39:22.092
Where's Edward?

39:25.296 --> 39:27.127
Hey, honey, I'm home.

39:27.231 --> 39:29.256
Hey, buddy.
Did you miss me?

39:29.367 --> 39:31.767
Ohh!

39:33.871 --> 39:36.101
- Why?
- <i>'Cause I ain't your buddy!</i>

39:37.308 --> 39:39.708
Where are the others?

39:39.810 --> 39:42.711
I thought we had something special.

39:42.813 --> 39:45.714
I even got a tattoo
with your name on it.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.657
<i>That looks more like</i>
<i>50 Cent's tattoo, you idiot.</i>

39:53.758 --> 39:56.886
Shit!
They did the wrong one.

39:59.363 --> 40:03.595
I won't ask again.
Where is the rest of your family?

40:03.701 --> 40:07.068
I told you,
they're not my family.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.507
<i>Tell me where they are.</i>

40:11.609 --> 40:14.009
Never.

40:20.518 --> 40:23.919
Yeah, they went to Mr. Tumnus's house.

40:25.122 --> 40:29.058
Yes! Yes!
You just got punk'd! Yes!

40:30.094 --> 40:31.994
He did it!
He did it!

40:32.096 --> 40:34.929
Say it to the camera.
Come on, say it right there.

40:35.032 --> 40:36.932
- Say it!
- I just got punk'd.

40:37.034 --> 40:39.628
Schwow! Yeah!

40:39.737 --> 40:44.003
We just punk'd Edward!
Schwow! Schwow! Yeah!

40:44.108 --> 40:47.874
That was awesome!
Yeah! Yes!

40:47.978 --> 40:50.606
This thing up here is all me, baby!

40:50.714 --> 40:52.614
The trucker hat-
That's awesome!

40:52.716 --> 40:55.981
I did it. You love it.
You'll take it. Punk'd 'im!

40:56.086 --> 41:00.045
- That was really funny! Oh, my gosh! Too funny!
- You are so annoying!

41:02.760 --> 41:04.853
No, that was really funny though!

41:04.962 --> 41:07.396
Schwow! Schwow! Schwow!
Schwow! Schwow!

41:07.498 --> 41:10.058
Candy-ass trucker hat!

41:10.167 --> 41:13.295
Schwow. Schwow.

41:13.404 --> 41:15.372
Silas!

41:23.013 --> 41:25.880
The kids are with Mr. Tumnus.

41:25.983 --> 41:29.043
I want you to find them
and kill them.

41:29.153 --> 41:33.249
Persona non grata.
Magna cum laude.

41:43.601 --> 41:49.335
Urts-hay oh-say ood-gay!
Ooh!

41:49.440 --> 41:51.908
Ood-gay.

41:52.009 --> 41:55.001
<i>Ooh.</i>

41:55.112 --> 41:57.103
No. No!

41:57.214 --> 41:59.182
- Here. You goin' to prison.
- Ow! Dude!

42:01.018 --> 42:03.350
- Edward!
- Edward!
- Edward!

42:03.454 --> 42:06.423
- <i>Edward!</i>
- Mr. Tumnus!

42:18.636 --> 42:21.070
I miss the smell of you, Harry Beaver.

42:25.342 --> 42:27.310
Eew.

42:29.580 --> 42:32.310
Oh, yeah.

42:35.019 --> 42:38.580
The White Bitch did this to you?
Shit!

42:38.689 --> 42:41.658
And now she has Edward.

42:41.759 --> 42:44.159
- We must rescue hi-
- Get ahold of yourself, Lucy!

42:44.261 --> 42:46.320
- Holy-
- <i>It's too dangerous.</i>

42:46.430 --> 42:49.160
If she catch you,
you are as good as dead.

42:49.266 --> 42:52.429
Um, that's me.

42:55.506 --> 42:57.406
"The resistance has found out...

42:57.508 --> 43:00.534
"that the White Bitch has completed
her weapon of mass destruction...

43:00.644 --> 43:02.475
and is going to launch it
in 24 hours."

43:02.580 --> 43:05.777
Let's get the hell out of here!

43:05.883 --> 43:08.477
Aslo is the only one
that can help now.

43:08.586 --> 43:11.282
Then take us to him.

43:13.390 --> 43:15.358
What'd you do that for?

43:17.695 --> 43:19.595
I forgot.

43:19.697 --> 43:23.599
Before you meet Aslo,
you must train.

43:23.701 --> 43:26.534
Only then you can defeat
the White Bitch...

43:26.637 --> 43:28.537
and save your brother.

43:28.639 --> 43:31.506
I'll meet you at Aslo's.
May the Force be with you.

43:44.054 --> 43:48.616
Someone's coming.
The bitch is on to you. You must go now.

43:48.726 --> 43:51.388
There you will train.

43:51.495 --> 43:53.395
Go!

43:56.266 --> 43:58.166
Mr. Tumnus?

43:58.268 --> 44:01.635
I will stay behind
and fight him off.

44:03.741 --> 44:07.734
No matter what,
you must not come back for me.

44:07.845 --> 44:10.405
- Yep.
- <i>Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!</i>

44:10.514 --> 44:13.108
Run!

44:27.364 --> 44:28.991
Stop!

44:29.099 --> 44:33.160
If you want them,
you'll have to go through me first.

44:34.371 --> 44:38.603
Please! Help!

44:38.709 --> 44:41.007
He needs our help!

44:41.111 --> 44:43.443
- <i>Help!</i>
- No, Susan, Lucy.

44:43.547 --> 44:45.640
He... wants us to go on.

44:45.749 --> 44:48.217
He sacrificed himself for us.

44:48.318 --> 44:51.253
<i>Peter, if you can hear me...</i>

44:51.355 --> 44:53.289
<i>come back now!</i>

44:55.392 --> 44:58.520
<i>I definitely underestimated</i>
<i>the situation.</i>

45:00.731 --> 45:02.562
<i>I'm in a lot of pain!</i>

45:02.666 --> 45:04.566
What should we do?

45:04.668 --> 45:07.569
Uh, we can't go back.
We have to-

45:07.671 --> 45:11.698
- We have to do what's best
for Edward and for Gnarnia.
- <i>Screw Gnarnia!</i>

45:13.811 --> 45:15.870
He's testing us.

45:15.979 --> 45:19.244
<i>This is not a test!</i>
<i>I can see my brains!</i>

45:35.933 --> 45:38.424
<i>Et tu, Brute?</i>

46:12.970 --> 46:16.201
Welcome!
My name is Harry Potter!

46:16.306 --> 46:19.707
Aren't you a little old
to still be a student here?

46:19.810 --> 46:22.210
Nonsense.
I am but 14.

46:22.312 --> 46:25.611
As are my two best friends,
Ron and Hermione.

46:26.917 --> 46:28.885
Greetings.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.754
Hope you chicks are on the pill.

46:32.856 --> 46:34.756
Harry likes to get wasted...

46:34.858 --> 46:37.053
then show off
his sorcerer's stones.

46:39.229 --> 46:43.131
They are definitely too old
to still be doing this shit.

46:43.233 --> 46:46.134
We shall train you
so you can defeat the White Bitch...

46:46.236 --> 46:48.136
and restore peace to Gnarnia.

46:48.238 --> 46:51.503
We'll show you everything we know,
like how to use...

46:51.608 --> 46:54.168
the invisibility cloak.

47:01.118 --> 47:03.643
Oh, no!
I'm completely invisible!

47:03.754 --> 47:06.518
Where am I?
Who's that?

47:06.623 --> 47:09.592
- Where am I? I could be anywhere.
- Harry. Harry!

47:09.693 --> 47:11.661
Where am I?

47:18.435 --> 47:20.665
Step off, Potter!

47:20.771 --> 47:23.365
Right.
Wrong cloak.

47:23.473 --> 47:25.703
Let the training montage begin!

47:25.809 --> 47:27.709
Cue inspirational music.

47:27.811 --> 47:29.779
Blame the cloak.

47:30.981 --> 47:34.417
- Get your hips nice and square.
- Okay, uh-

47:34.518 --> 47:37.043
- All right. I'll set it up for you.
- Okay.

47:37.154 --> 47:39.122
- <i>You ready?</i>
- Yeah, I'm ready.

47:50.667 --> 47:53.431
Ipso facto "patrolo!"

47:53.537 --> 47:56.472
Oh! Yeah!

48:00.577 --> 48:03.273
Confront your fear!

48:03.380 --> 48:06.281
Do not cower
in the face of danger!

48:06.383 --> 48:10.479
Let nothing stand in the way of defeating
your enemy! Come on, Peter!

48:10.587 --> 48:12.953
Stop being such a little nancy boy!

48:13.056 --> 48:16.617
<i>Schoolgirl! Pussy!</i>
<i>Chicken!</i>

48:32.976 --> 48:36.434
Congratulations, Peter.
Your training is now complete.

48:36.546 --> 48:39.947
- You are now ready to meet Aslo.
- Yes!

48:40.050 --> 48:45.616
This crystal will finally
put an end to the resistance.

48:45.722 --> 48:49.249
I will start a series of earthquakes...

48:49.359 --> 48:52.260
that will collapse all of Gnarnia...

48:52.362 --> 48:54.694
and grow a new continent...

48:54.798 --> 48:58.131
where only I
and my followers will live.

49:00.170 --> 49:03.936
<i>Yo, Bitch, that's pretty much</i>
<i>the plot of</i> Superman Returns.

49:04.041 --> 49:06.168
Pretty much, yeah.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.825
It's an I.M. from Silas.

49:25.329 --> 49:27.559
<i>"The... keeds...</i>

49:27.664 --> 49:30.098
"have...

49:30.200 --> 49:33.226
esca-puh-duh."

49:33.337 --> 49:35.897
<i>"Escap-puh-duh."</i>

49:36.006 --> 49:38.998
"The keeds have esca-puh-duh."

49:40.610 --> 49:42.703
The kids have escaped!

49:44.314 --> 49:45.804
<i>Duh!</i>

49:47.784 --> 49:53.017
I've got to catch and kill those children
before they ruin everything.

49:53.123 --> 49:55.387
See what else Edward knows.

49:55.492 --> 49:57.323
Let me out!

49:57.427 --> 49:59.827
Oh, I gotta get outta here.

49:59.930 --> 50:02.330
I'm never gonna see
my family again.

50:03.533 --> 50:05.524
I'll get you out of here, mate.

50:09.139 --> 50:12.040
Captain Morgan!
I love your rum!

50:13.310 --> 50:17.371
No!
Captain Jack Swallows.

50:19.716 --> 50:22.276
At your service.

50:22.386 --> 50:25.287
Jack Swallows?

50:25.389 --> 50:27.687
That's kinda gay, dude.

50:27.791 --> 50:29.691
Mmm.

50:29.793 --> 50:34.355
I believe in your quest, son,
and I'll reunite you with your family.

50:34.464 --> 50:38.298
I've got a ship waiting for us.

50:38.402 --> 50:41.394
Shh.

50:41.505 --> 50:44.303
How are we gonna
get out of here?

50:44.408 --> 50:46.399
Ah!

50:51.415 --> 50:53.576
Man down! Man down!

50:53.683 --> 50:55.651
I could have faked it!

50:59.423 --> 51:01.755
Quick!
He needs your help!

51:17.507 --> 51:19.532
Come, come!
We haven't got all day!

51:49.739 --> 51:52.105
Mmm!

51:52.209 --> 51:54.541
Wow!
A real pirate ship!

51:54.644 --> 51:57.670
<i>Peter, Lucy and Susan</i>
<i>won't believe this.</i>

51:59.049 --> 52:01.779
Hey, this is awesome.
What's it like being a pirate?

52:01.885 --> 52:06.015
Yo-ho, Ed, let me
break it down for you.

53:37.314 --> 53:39.179
Word to the Kraken!

53:42.419 --> 53:44.910
Time is winding, old boy.

53:45.021 --> 53:47.080
So where's your family, eh?

53:47.190 --> 53:50.125
They're on their way to
the Ancient Tables to meet Aslo...

53:50.227 --> 53:52.127
where he's assembled
the resistance.

53:52.229 --> 53:55.096
Interesting.

53:55.198 --> 53:57.223
God, you're easy.

54:04.674 --> 54:07.336
Thanks, love.
Oh, my.

54:09.179 --> 54:12.273
Wait. So this whole thing was a setup
just to get information out of me?

54:12.382 --> 54:16.512
Sorry, mate.
This isn't even a working pirate ship. Savvy?

54:22.392 --> 54:25.919
- Oh, shit!
- It was nice doin' business with you, love.

54:28.098 --> 54:29.759
Bugger!

54:32.869 --> 54:36.498
I'll get you for this...

54:36.606 --> 54:39.302
you-you-

54:39.409 --> 54:42.640
you... bitch.

54:47.717 --> 54:51.619
I always hated you,
Captain Jack Swallows.

54:55.292 --> 54:59.194
You think I like wearin' this
funny-lookin' hat? I'll roast your nuts!

54:59.296 --> 55:01.696
So...

55:01.798 --> 55:04.562
your family's going to Aslo.

55:04.668 --> 55:07.728
Summon the troops.

55:07.837 --> 55:10.635
<i>If it's a war they want...</i>

55:10.740 --> 55:12.799
it's a war they will get.

55:16.079 --> 55:18.547
Let's start things off
with a bang, shall we?

55:18.648 --> 55:21.708
- But you'll kill millions.
- Billions.

55:23.253 --> 55:25.813
Come on.
Let me hear you say it.

55:25.922 --> 55:28.914
- My family will stop you!
- Wrong!

55:29.025 --> 55:31.892
Ooh!

55:45.875 --> 55:48.366
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

55:50.113 --> 55:52.741
Oh! Ooh!

55:52.849 --> 55:55.249
Oh! Ooh!

55:55.352 --> 55:58.253
Damn that <i>Superman</i> plot!

56:39.929 --> 56:42.261
My name Borat.

56:42.365 --> 56:46.131
This my country of Gnarnia.
Is nice!

56:55.812 --> 56:57.837
She is my sister.

56:57.947 --> 57:01.974
She is number four faun prostitute
in all of Gnarnia.

57:02.085 --> 57:03.985
Nice!

57:15.098 --> 57:17.464
Aslo?

57:17.567 --> 57:19.762
Mmm!

57:19.869 --> 57:23.361
Where you goin', doll face?
I just took my Cialis.

57:23.473 --> 57:25.441
Screw you, Aslo!

57:26.810 --> 57:30.007
Ah, thanks a lot.

57:30.113 --> 57:31.603
You're Aslo the Lion?

57:31.714 --> 57:35.275
Li-man-
half lion, half man.

57:35.385 --> 57:39.788
- So you mean you're-
- My father Siegfried boinked a lion.

57:39.889 --> 57:44.292
But, you know,
what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

57:44.394 --> 57:49.195
Let me guess. The prophecy family.

57:49.299 --> 57:51.563
Uh-huh.
We've come a long way.

57:51.668 --> 57:54.728
Whatever.
You're missing one.

57:54.838 --> 57:57.739
- Yes, our brother Edward.
- Yes, our brother Edward.

57:59.142 --> 58:02.168
He betrayed you,
went to the White Bitch.

58:02.278 --> 58:05.042
- Well, it wasn't his fault.
- Yada yada yada.

58:05.148 --> 58:10.484
- But the prophecy says-
- "But the prophecy, the prophecy."

58:10.587 --> 58:12.919
Fine.
I'll help you get Edward back.

58:13.022 --> 58:14.353
- Oh!
- Mmm!

58:14.457 --> 58:18.553
But there's something
you've got to do for me.

58:23.633 --> 58:25.794
What are you in here for, Mel?

58:28.938 --> 58:30.769
You know.

58:30.874 --> 58:33.206
Glug, glug.
Vroom, vroom.

58:33.309 --> 58:35.539
Whoo!

58:39.883 --> 58:42.443
Listen, sugar tits.
F.Y.I.

58:42.552 --> 58:45.350
I like to sleep in the buff.

58:55.031 --> 58:57.329
Wow.

58:57.433 --> 58:59.628
Yeah.

58:59.736 --> 59:03.433
- That was spectacular.
- My butt's sore.

59:03.540 --> 59:05.440
Uh-oh!

59:05.542 --> 59:07.942
Dutch oven!

59:08.044 --> 59:10.706
<i>Ooh!</i>

59:19.722 --> 59:21.986
It's Aslo!

59:29.866 --> 59:35.429
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii,</i>
<i>et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:19.443
Huh?

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:56.083
Come on, kids.

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:06.193
Peter? Lucy! Susan!

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:10.698
Oh, you guys, I've been such a prick.
Won't you ever forgive me?

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.734
We already have.

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:16.703
- We're a family now.
- We're a family now.

01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:19.366
I like the sound of that.

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:27.245
- I love you guys.
- Oh, have your Dr. Phil moment later.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:30.080
- Now get out of here!
- Go, go, go.

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:41.195
Good-bye, Aslo.

01:01:57.037 --> 01:01:58.971
What?
What's wrong?

01:01:59.072 --> 01:02:01.597
He didn't make it.

01:02:01.708 --> 01:02:03.573
Oh, shit! A talking beaver!

01:02:03.677 --> 01:02:05.304
Wait!

01:02:08.215 --> 01:02:11.150
<i>Oh, it's hard out here</i>
<i>for a beaver.</i>

01:02:11.251 --> 01:02:14.414
You forgetful bitch!
I already met you.

01:02:14.521 --> 01:02:17.046
I know. Yeah.

01:02:17.157 --> 01:02:22.789
Aslo never came back.
The White Bitch killed him.

01:02:22.896 --> 01:02:26.161
And it gets worse.

01:02:30.737 --> 01:02:33.171
It's over.

01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:37.168
The White Bitch
will surely rule forever.

01:02:37.277 --> 01:02:39.575
But we have you.
You will lead us.

01:02:39.679 --> 01:02:42.170
You're the future
kings and queens of Gnarnia.

01:02:42.282 --> 01:02:44.978
It will be an honor
to fight for you, my lords.

01:02:45.085 --> 01:02:47.178
We'll fight for you.

01:02:49.256 --> 01:02:51.156
And so will we.

01:02:51.258 --> 01:02:54.659
We'll stand behind you, Peter.

01:02:54.761 --> 01:02:59.494
That bitch has threatened
our mutant way of life for too long.

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:01.931
We believe in you.

01:03:07.607 --> 01:03:09.541
Tomorrow, we fight.

01:03:09.643 --> 01:03:12.009
So tonight, we party!

01:03:14.114 --> 01:03:18.210
Hello, Gnarnia!
Are you ready for rock and roll?

01:03:45.979 --> 01:03:48.607
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:03:48.715 --> 01:03:51.707
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:03:51.818 --> 01:03:53.979
Yeah!

01:03:54.087 --> 01:03:55.850
Yeah!

01:03:55.956 --> 01:03:57.856
You're up, Sis.

01:03:57.958 --> 01:04:01.018
Uh-uh.
I like to keep a clear head.

01:04:01.127 --> 01:04:03.823
Come on. Loosen up for once.
You wanna-

01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:07.730
You wanna, you know,
get your swerve on, like this.

01:04:07.834 --> 01:04:11.361
Like that. And then-

01:04:11.471 --> 01:04:15.430
No. Why?
What's the worst that could happen?

01:04:19.279 --> 01:04:21.543
- Maybe just one.
- All right.

01:04:25.385 --> 01:04:27.910
- Whoo-hoo!
- Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:04:28.021 --> 01:04:30.353
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:04:30.457 --> 01:04:32.687
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:51.071
Hi.

01:04:51.177 --> 01:04:53.771
Hi.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.611
So, you're gonna be
the king of Gnarnia?

01:04:59.185 --> 01:05:01.483
- That's what they say.
- <i>Mmm.</i>

01:05:01.588 --> 01:05:04.921
I think that's so hot.

01:05:05.025 --> 01:05:09.223
Why don't we get out of here.

01:05:12.899 --> 01:05:15.163
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:05:15.268 --> 01:05:19.170
Chug it!

01:05:19.272 --> 01:05:23.800
Whoo! Yeah!

01:05:54.107 --> 01:05:56.268
I'm okay.

01:05:56.376 --> 01:05:58.139
You're good?

01:05:59.813 --> 01:06:02.304
- Hmm?
- I'm okay.

01:06:05.719 --> 01:06:08.051
Oh!

01:06:30.176 --> 01:06:34.704
Oh.

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:46.550
- You know, I've got special powers.
- Uh-huh.

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:49.424
I'm a shape-changer.

01:06:49.529 --> 01:06:52.521
I can change my form into anything.

01:06:52.632 --> 01:06:54.190
What do you like?

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.291
Uh-

01:06:58.638 --> 01:07:02.096
Big hooters
with silver dollar nipples?

01:07:02.208 --> 01:07:04.176
All right.

01:07:10.884 --> 01:07:13.910
And a ghetto booty.

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:17.046
Like- Like a lot of junk
in the trunk, say.

01:07:17.157 --> 01:07:21.218
Kinky. Mmm.

01:07:25.198 --> 01:07:27.632
Badonkadonk.

01:07:27.734 --> 01:07:30.965
- And a mono-brow!
- Come again?

01:07:31.071 --> 01:07:33.665
Mono-brow! Mono-brow!
King wants a mono-brow!

01:07:33.773 --> 01:07:35.741
Okay, okay.

01:07:41.514 --> 01:07:43.948
And big, flabby grandma arms.

01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:46.644
Oh!

01:07:46.753 --> 01:07:51.053
Bingo wings,
like a fat, blue Britney Spears.

01:07:51.157 --> 01:07:53.921
Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

01:07:55.729 --> 01:07:58.493
Come here!

01:08:24.224 --> 01:08:26.124
Where is everybody?

01:08:29.729 --> 01:08:33.460
I don't know. Maybe it had something to do
with Susan puking on everyone last night.

01:08:34.567 --> 01:08:36.466
We seem to be outnumbered.

01:09:08.167 --> 01:09:10.363
No.

01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:12.870
I'm not running anymore.

01:09:18.278 --> 01:09:20.678
Ow!

01:09:25.484 --> 01:09:27.715
Oh!

01:09:27.821 --> 01:09:31.348
We may not have the numbers on our side
or the weapons she possesses...

01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:33.584
but we have something
far more powerful.

01:09:33.693 --> 01:09:35.558
Perky breasts?

01:09:38.096 --> 01:09:39.997
The strength of our family.

01:09:40.099 --> 01:09:42.897
I'd follow you anywhere, brother.

01:09:52.912 --> 01:09:54.937
<i>Oh, my-</i>

01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:02.183
Revenge is... mine!

01:10:02.288 --> 01:10:04.256
Jack Swallows!

01:10:09.863 --> 01:10:13.959
Payback is a bitch, White Bitch!

01:10:14.067 --> 01:10:18.731
You owe me your soul,
Jack Swallows, and it's time to pay up!

01:10:54.507 --> 01:10:57.635
Oh!
She's blinded me, matey!

01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.188
Oh, bugger!

01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:12.953
What a tool.

01:11:16.596 --> 01:11:18.496
Show them no mercy.

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:11.181
Take that, Kumar!
Huh!

01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:27.927
No!

01:12:37.443 --> 01:12:39.604
Oh, yes.

01:12:42.215 --> 01:12:45.048
Yes, that's right.
Grovel.

01:12:47.153 --> 01:12:51.453
Just like your parents did
before I killed them.

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.274
<i>Wow. Let's slow things down</i>
<i>for a better look.</i>

01:13:21.821 --> 01:13:23.482
Ah.

01:13:23.589 --> 01:13:24.988
<i>Oh! Oh, dear.</i>

01:13:28.661 --> 01:13:33.064
Oh, that's-
That-That is dis-

01:13:41.541 --> 01:13:43.441
Oh.

01:14:10.770 --> 01:14:13.500
Ooh!

01:14:23.883 --> 01:14:26.784
Let's get 'em!

01:15:15.768 --> 01:15:18.066
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.390
It's the crystal!

01:15:43.496 --> 01:15:46.260
- We're all gonna die!
- We're all gonna die!

01:15:47.567 --> 01:15:50.400
Give me the remote control.

01:15:56.375 --> 01:15:59.469
Yes!

01:16:05.651 --> 01:16:10.054
No, stop.
We will not stoop to her level.

01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:13.715
I hate those fuckin' kids.

01:16:13.826 --> 01:16:16.693
The new Gnarnia
will be a democracy...

01:16:16.796 --> 01:16:19.356
complete with due process.

01:16:19.465 --> 01:16:23.629
She shall be given a fair trial,
judged by a jury of her peers.

01:16:23.736 --> 01:16:27.331
<i>Sorry, Bitch.</i>

01:16:29.709 --> 01:16:32.610
Right.

01:16:32.712 --> 01:16:34.976
Oh, screw her anyway.

01:16:36.849 --> 01:16:39.511
Make a beaver a hole.
Get your butt out of my face.

01:16:39.619 --> 01:16:41.951
<i>Hot, moist beaver comin' through.</i>

01:16:42.054 --> 01:16:45.148
May I present
the kings and queens of Gnarnia!

01:16:45.258 --> 01:16:48.694
Peter the Heroic.

01:16:48.794 --> 01:16:51.422
<i>Susan the Just.</i>

01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:54.090
<i>Edward the Loyal.</i>

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:58.432
<i>And Lucy the Dumb Shit.</i>

01:16:58.537 --> 01:17:00.505
All hail!

01:17:30.736 --> 01:17:34.866
<i>And so it was</i>
<i>that Peter, Susan, Edward and Lucy...</i>

01:17:34.974 --> 01:17:37.841
<i>restored peace to Gnarnia.</i>

01:17:37.943 --> 01:17:42.937
<i>They were orphans no more.</i>
<i>They were now a family.</i>

01:17:44.216 --> 01:17:48.152
<i>They ruled Gnarnia</i>
<i>for many years to come.</i>

01:17:48.254 --> 01:17:51.746
<i>That is, until they found</i>
<i>the wardrobe once again.</i>

01:17:51.857 --> 01:17:53.757
Let's cross streams.

01:18:02.601 --> 01:18:04.501
There we go.

01:18:04.603 --> 01:18:06.867
Oops!
A little bit of blood.

01:18:19.285 --> 01:18:21.185
It's-

01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:28.626
- It's the wardrobe.
- It's been so long.

01:18:28.728 --> 01:18:30.889
It's been so long.

01:18:32.131 --> 01:18:35.100
Chuck Norris rules.

01:19:15.508 --> 01:19:17.976
We're young again!

01:19:19.745 --> 01:19:22.179
Jagshemash!

01:19:22.281 --> 01:19:26.741
You did it!
You make movie film have happy ending.

01:19:29.355 --> 01:19:30.982
Not!

01:21:02.848 --> 01:21:04.782
Oh, my-

01:21:09.154 --> 01:21:12.555
- <i>Let us out, freak!</i>
- No can do.

01:21:12.658 --> 01:21:14.717
I-

01:21:17.897 --> 01:21:23.733
No.
Captain Jack <i>Swallows</i>!

01:21:23.836 --> 01:21:27.795
Captain Jack <i>Swallows</i>!

01:21:27.907 --> 01:21:30.705
- Shit. Swallowing!
- <i>Cut.</i>

01:21:30.809 --> 01:21:34.768
No!
Captain Jack <i>Swallows</i>!

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.644
Sorry.

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:41.550
Wait. Can I ask you
something about the sucking?

01:21:41.654 --> 01:21:43.884
Am I-

01:21:43.989 --> 01:21:46.514
Am I, like, sucking the chrome off,
or is it-

01:21:46.625 --> 01:21:48.525
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- I mean- Okay.

01:21:48.627 --> 01:21:50.788
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:21:53.465 --> 01:21:56.457
Oh! Hey!

01:21:56.569 --> 01:21:59.538
Mmm. Mmm!

01:21:59.638 --> 01:22:02.664
Well, guess what.

01:22:02.775 --> 01:22:05.141
- <i>What?</i>
- Guess what.

01:22:05.244 --> 01:22:08.509
First-

01:22:08.614 --> 01:22:10.980
Mi, mi, mi, mi,
mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi!

01:22:11.083 --> 01:22:14.450
When I'm makin' you stuff,
quit cryin' and eat it!

01:22:14.553 --> 01:22:17.647
Your mother ate it!
She liked it. It was <i>fine</i>.

01:22:30.669 --> 01:22:33.001
- Where did I hit him? I hit him on the head.
- <i>Cut!</i>

01:22:39.578 --> 01:22:41.546
Shit.

01:22:46.452 --> 01:22:49.080
We'll stand behind you, Peter.

01:22:49.188 --> 01:22:51.884
That bitch has threatened
our way of life-

01:22:51.991 --> 01:22:55.017
Our mutant-
Shit. Sorry. Bollocks.

01:22:55.127 --> 01:22:57.459
She shall be given a fair trial...

01:22:57.563 --> 01:23:00.794
judged by a jury of her peers.

01:23:00.899 --> 01:23:03.333
We shall build a courthouse...

01:23:03.435 --> 01:23:06.802
with crushed velvet drapes
and ample parking.

01:23:08.407 --> 01:23:10.375
I'm so hot.

01:23:13.679 --> 01:23:16.807
Oh, my gosh. I passed the yellow line.
I just don't see it.

01:23:16.915 --> 01:23:21.682
Li-man-
half lion, half man.

01:23:21.787 --> 01:23:23.687
<i>So you mean you're-</i>

01:23:23.789 --> 01:23:25.814
My mom went to a party
at Siegfried and Roy's.

01:23:25.924 --> 01:23:29.485
She got drunk, and then
it was her turn in the barrel.

01:23:29.595 --> 01:23:31.495
It's a brutal game.

01:23:31.597 --> 01:23:34.566
Justice shall reign supreme...

01:23:34.667 --> 01:23:38.433
even for elves and fauns...

01:23:38.537 --> 01:23:41.995
albinos and the Irish.

01:23:49.948 --> 01:23:53.543
- I saw stripes!
- No! Man!

01:23:53.652 --> 01:23:57.110
We shall revolutionize
the health system.

01:23:57.222 --> 01:23:59.588
There will be no more
teenage pregnancies...

01:23:59.692 --> 01:24:02.058
without my consent...

01:24:02.161 --> 01:24:04.095
and without their consent.

01:24:04.196 --> 01:24:07.256
I shouldn't have had sex with Shrek!

01:24:07.366 --> 01:24:11.826
Like it or not, we're all in-

01:24:11.937 --> 01:24:15.100
- You okay?
- No. But go ahead.

01:24:15.207 --> 01:24:18.108
- Like it or not, we're all in this.
- Like it or not-

01:24:18.210 --> 01:24:20.110
- Oh, I can't even do it now.
- Let's do it.

01:24:20.212 --> 01:24:24.239
Damn that Shrek!
He said he wasn't a carrier.

01:24:24.349 --> 01:24:28.547
Because, sweet tits,
we're four kids nobody would ever miss.

01:24:28.654 --> 01:24:30.952
We'll be stuck here
till we dizz-i rizz-i.

01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:36.994
Don't t-zelle me what to d-zoo!

01:24:37.096 --> 01:24:39.621
The White Bitch is no more.

01:24:39.732 --> 01:24:41.666
Now, we shall be queens.

01:24:41.767 --> 01:24:47.637
Last night, I had sex
with a unicorn. Nice!

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:52.507
Hey, look.
It's Lindsay Lohan.

01:24:52.611 --> 01:24:54.670
I haven't got
enough left for Roseanne.

01:25:02.888 --> 01:25:05.152
- Oh. So I was supposed to- I supposed to fall?
- <i>Cut it.</i>

01:25:05.257 --> 01:25:07.157
- It's supposed to hit me, right?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:25:08.594 --> 01:25:11.654
- Ooh!
- <i>Cut!</i>

01:25:11.764 --> 01:25:15.996
Oh. But I need something
about the others first.

01:25:16.101 --> 01:25:18.626
But first- Sorry.
Give me your hand.

01:25:20.205 --> 01:25:22.639
Oh, no!

01:25:22.741 --> 01:25:26.973
But kings need to boss
their subject's ship-What's the line?

01:25:27.079 --> 01:25:29.445
Yes.

01:25:29.548 --> 01:25:35.487
Bring me the others, and I'll crown you
the throne. Shit. Crown you what?

01:25:43.428 --> 01:25:46.226
I'm big.
I got big balls.

01:25:46.331 --> 01:25:48.595
See <i>Epic Movie</i>...

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:52.796
or drunk Mel Gibson will hurt me.

01:25:52.905 --> 01:25:54.873
Not!

01:25:56.608 --> 01:25:58.803
You.

01:26:02.314 --> 01:26:04.714
So now you all seen my crib.

01:26:04.817 --> 01:26:07.047
So get the hell out Oh...!
