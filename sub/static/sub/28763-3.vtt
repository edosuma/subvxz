02:46.751 --> 02:47.752
Ed?

02:55.969 --> 02:57.011
I fucked up.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.349
There's no other way to say it.

03:03.017 --> 03:07.021
And I don't think that I'm gonna wrap it
in a bow and make it better,

03:07.105 --> 03:10.358
but I'm desperate to fix it.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.362
Have you considered why you strayed?

03:16.114 --> 03:18.283
How's your husband
to trust it won't happen again?

03:18.366 --> 03:20.910
- Because it won't.
- How can he trust that?

03:22.287 --> 03:24.414
- Why should he?
- Thank you.

03:25.540 --> 03:28.668
We'll turn to your betrayal in a minute.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.003
My betrayal?

03:30.086 --> 03:34.424
Adultery is one form of infidelity.
Indifference is another.

03:34.507 --> 03:38.761
You describe yourself as a go-along,
get-along, don't-make-waves kind of guy.

03:38.845 --> 03:43.308
That makes you either wonderfully
accommodating or profoundly disengaged.

03:44.559 --> 03:47.896
Could it be Madeline was just trying
to get your attention?

03:47.979 --> 03:51.149
She has always had my attention.

03:52.901 --> 03:57.322
Devotion on my end
has not been a problem.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.078
Why were you unfaithful?

04:04.162 --> 04:06.331
- I don't know.
- If you were to guess?

04:07.916 --> 04:09.292
Should I guess?

04:11.085 --> 04:12.503
You don't believe in you.

04:12.587 --> 04:14.505
How can you trust the relational equation

04:14.589 --> 04:16.632
when you have no faith
in the sum part of you?

04:16.716 --> 04:20.011
- Math's not my strong suit, so...
- Because you didn't go to college?

04:20.094 --> 04:21.012
I'm sorry?

04:21.095 --> 04:24.766
You spoke earlier of your daughter
not wanting to go to college.

04:24.849 --> 04:27.060
Does that have something to do
with her perception...?

04:27.143 --> 04:29.562
I don't see where
that is relevant.

04:29.646 --> 04:30.897
Did you go to college?

04:32.774 --> 04:36.361
Again, I don't see the connection
between what's going on...

04:36.444 --> 04:40.323
Abigail will be nothing without college
perhaps because you are?

04:45.078 --> 04:46.996
Have you been feeding her this?

04:47.080 --> 04:49.457
Why did your first husband leave you?

04:50.416 --> 04:51.918
Because he's an asshole.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.799
Tell me about your parents.
What was their marriage like?

04:59.008 --> 05:00.008
- Fine.
- Fine?

05:00.051 --> 05:03.638
- Married for 40 years.
- Forty years. You talk to them much?

05:15.066 --> 05:17.402
<i>You have to be able
to hold your breath, baby.</i>

05:17.485 --> 05:19.278
<i>But I don't like it.</i>

05:21.114 --> 05:22.699
<i>You know what?</i>

05:22.782 --> 05:25.076
<i>I hate getting my head wet too,</i>

05:25.159 --> 05:27.245
we have to be able to hold our breath
underwater

05:27.328 --> 05:29.956
so if something ever happens,
we don't drown, baby.

05:33.543 --> 05:35.420
I don't want to.

05:41.592 --> 05:45.221
Maybe when I was 3, 4,
I walked into my parent's bedroom,

05:45.304 --> 05:50.351
and my dad was having sex with a woman
that wasn't my mom.

05:50.435 --> 05:54.856
And they were making all kinds of noises,
and then I got scared.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.315
And what happened?

05:57.692 --> 05:59.110
He pulled me out.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.570
- Oh.
- Um...

06:01.571 --> 06:04.282
And closed the door, and he said:

06:04.365 --> 06:07.910
"There are things
your mother doesn't ever need to know."

06:07.994 --> 06:10.580
- And you've never talked about it?
- No.

06:13.624 --> 06:18.755
I guess that maybe that's why
I was so devastated when Nathan left me.

06:20.048 --> 06:23.176
Because it confirmed
my biggest fear about marriage.

06:25.261 --> 06:26.971
It's not to be trusted.

06:28.181 --> 06:29.891
I wouldn't give up on Ed.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.478
All right?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.521
I really fucked up.

06:35.605 --> 06:38.149
He's not gonna leave you. Not Ed.

06:41.778 --> 06:43.029
How are you doing?

06:44.238 --> 06:47.075
Have you had
any more early morning joyrides?

06:49.285 --> 06:50.161
Funny.

06:50.244 --> 06:54.248
No, I'm not being funny.
It actually really scared me.

06:54.332 --> 06:56.459
What did Madam Shrink have to say
about that?

06:56.542 --> 06:59.253
She thinks it's somehow tied to me...

07:01.881 --> 07:04.050
not being sufficiently over Perry.

07:06.094 --> 07:07.970
Life just feels colorless now.

07:08.054 --> 07:10.473
It just feels flat and dull.

07:13.142 --> 07:17.688
As dead as he is,
sometimes I think maybe I'm deader.

07:19.065 --> 07:20.441
I was a better mother.

07:20.525 --> 07:23.194
- No. Honey...
- I was a better mother with him. I was.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.655
- No. Don't say that.
- Yes. I was.

07:28.074 --> 07:30.034
I need to find joy for them.

07:31.953 --> 07:33.830
And he helps me with that.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.552
Jane.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.554
- Yeah?
- I'm Mary Louise Wright.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.930
Uh, we may have met.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.641
- I'm Max and Josh's grandmother.
- Yeah, hi.

07:53.724 --> 07:57.478
I'm sorry to trouble you
here at work, but, um...

07:57.562 --> 08:02.650
Celeste has shared with me
some interesting news.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.862
How would you feel
about submitting to a paternity test?

08:06.946 --> 08:09.740
I mean, submitting Ziggy
to a paternity test.

08:12.368 --> 08:14.912
Uh, yeah,
I don't need to take a paternity test.

08:14.996 --> 08:16.998
I know exactly who my son's father is.

08:17.081 --> 08:19.834
- Hmm. Even so...
- I'm not asking you for anything.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.711
No, I realize that.

08:21.794 --> 08:23.462
I suppose I'm asking.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.548
For what?

08:25.631 --> 08:30.428
Well, I'm presented with the idea
that my son was both an adulterer and a...

08:30.511 --> 08:31.596
And a rapist.

08:31.679 --> 08:35.015
And I am desperate to squash that idea.

08:35.099 --> 08:39.937
Mm. Well, I can tell you
that he's the only man I'd been with.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.272
That you recall.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.732
Excuse me?

08:42.815 --> 08:44.483
Things happen these days.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.778
Men put drugs in pretty girls' drinks,
things happen.

08:47.862 --> 08:49.906
People don't remember sometimes.

08:49.989 --> 08:50.989
I remember.

08:51.949 --> 08:52.992
Perfectly.

08:54.202 --> 08:56.370
Far more vividly than I care to.

08:58.039 --> 08:59.999
- Just a simple blood test.
- No.

09:05.922 --> 09:11.969
<i>What a tangled web we weave
when first we practice to deceive.</i>

09:12.053 --> 09:14.931
But Charlotte didn't say that.
She said, "Some Pig."

09:15.014 --> 09:16.974
She didn't say anything
about a tangled web.

09:17.058 --> 09:18.893
She certainly spun one.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.270
I mean, she made Wilbur out
to be an outlier

09:21.354 --> 09:24.357
when in truth, he was kind of ordinary.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.608
So, Ziggy...

09:27.151 --> 09:28.778
does that make Charlotte a liar?

09:32.281 --> 09:33.950
It makes her a grownup.

09:34.033 --> 09:37.078
Lying to protect someone she loves,
that's what grownups do.

09:37.161 --> 09:40.164
I think
she was probably just rebranding Wilbur.

09:40.248 --> 09:41.749
Rebranding?

09:41.832 --> 09:42.917
I see.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.837
- Well, you all wanna know what I think?
- Uh-huh.

09:46.921 --> 09:51.175
I think Charlotte didn't want Wilbur
to get eaten.

09:51.259 --> 09:55.763
I don't think she wanted any pigs
to be eaten, and we all know why, don't we?

09:55.846 --> 09:58.266
Sustainability.

09:58.349 --> 10:00.309
Exactly. Exactly.

10:00.393 --> 10:04.188
How many gallons of water does it take
to make a single pound of sausage?

10:04.272 --> 10:06.274
A thousand.

10:06.357 --> 10:09.151
A thousand gallons. And how many
showers does that add up to?

10:09.235 --> 10:10.778
Over 50.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.155
Over 50 showers.

10:13.239 --> 10:16.867
So imagine, you would have
to take a shower every single day

10:16.951 --> 10:19.328
for almost two months to...

10:23.708 --> 10:24.917
ETA about 10 minutes.

10:25.001 --> 10:28.170
Amabella, your mother's gonna meet
you at the hospital, okay, sweetie?

10:28.254 --> 10:29.463
I wanna go with her.

10:29.547 --> 10:31.924
We've got you covered.
Let me get her backpack.

10:32.008 --> 10:34.093
What the fu... What happened?

10:34.176 --> 10:39.140
- Mrs. Klein.
- What... I'm Amabella's mom. Renata Klein.

10:39.223 --> 10:42.435
- What did she do? What's...?
- Mrs. Klein. I'm Dr. Feldman.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.770
Your daughter was brought in
with an anxiety attack.

10:44.854 --> 10:45.854
Anxiety attack?

10:45.896 --> 10:49.275
We've given her a mild sedative,
she's resting, she's not in any danger.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.944
She was in a little bit of a shock
when she first came in.

10:52.028 --> 10:53.654
- What?
- She's fine. She's resting.

10:53.738 --> 10:55.489
- Okay.
- Yeah. Right this way.

10:55.573 --> 10:56.699
What did you do?

11:00.745 --> 11:05.541
Did somebody hurt you
or say something or...?

11:05.624 --> 11:08.002
No. I'm okay, Mom.

11:08.085 --> 11:09.420
Sweetheart.

11:09.503 --> 11:13.007
You were discovered in a closet
practically unconscious.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.052
- Was she checked for bite marks?
- Honey, come on.

11:16.135 --> 11:18.763
She was bitten last year, right?
So...

11:18.846 --> 11:21.265
Maybe somebody's bullying you again or...

11:21.349 --> 11:23.059
- No.
- Hey, baby,

11:23.142 --> 11:24.310
you okay there, my girl?

11:24.393 --> 11:28.564
Don't talk to her. I got this, okay?
I think you've done enough, don't you?

11:28.647 --> 11:31.609
You...
What the hell are you talking about?

11:31.692 --> 11:35.029
Gordon, she's obviously
under immense stress.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.281
You think, Renata?

11:37.365 --> 11:39.533
- Team. Team.
- Yes.

11:39.617 --> 11:43.037
Hello, doctor. I would like my daughter
transferred to Stanford, please.

11:44.163 --> 11:48.167
- Because?
- Because it's Stanford. I mean, please.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.836
Well, she's being released.
She's cleared for discharge.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.713
- Oh, well, look at that.
- There we go.

11:52.797 --> 11:55.383
- Hey.
- Counseling is certainly indicated.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.095
Perhaps for the entire family.

11:59.178 --> 12:02.306
You don't know anything about my family.
Okay?

12:02.390 --> 12:05.726
I know your own stress,
not helping the situation.

12:05.810 --> 12:08.312
"Your own stress..."

12:08.396 --> 12:09.396
Please.

12:09.438 --> 12:12.733
Honey, isn't that great?
We're gonna go home.

12:12.817 --> 12:14.318
- You're going home.
- Don't talk.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.407
Will you ever forgive me?

12:19.490 --> 12:22.159
Yes, of course, honey. It's not your fault.

12:22.243 --> 12:23.953
I blurted it out.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.080
The blurting is not the problem.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.040
My doing it is the problem.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.670
- You're in therapy, so that's good. Right?
- Yeah.

12:33.838 --> 12:38.217
I mean, the doctor's pretty much a crock.
She...

12:38.300 --> 12:41.887
She thinks I feel like an empty sack
because I didn't graduate from college,

12:41.971 --> 12:44.473
and that's why I'm obsessed
with your going.

12:44.557 --> 12:47.977
But that is not entirely true.

12:48.060 --> 12:51.605
Mom... I mean,
when we would watch <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i>

12:51.689 --> 12:55.943
you would turn into a puddle
every time The Scarecrow got his diploma.

12:58.821 --> 13:03.617
Well, I'm glad you're back home.
Otherwise, I might be totally alone.

13:05.119 --> 13:06.662
He's not gonna leave you.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.210
Hello.

13:13.294 --> 13:14.336
Oh.

13:14.420 --> 13:18.174
We had such wonderful fun together.

13:18.257 --> 13:20.384
- Did you, honey?
- Yeah.

13:20.468 --> 13:23.095
- Can Dr. Peep have a sleepover?
- Oh.

13:23.179 --> 13:28.642
Oh, sweetheart, I would love that,
but I need to get back to my sheep.

13:28.726 --> 13:31.187
I'm afraid they'd miss me.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.689
Could I talk to your parents
for a second in private?

13:33.772 --> 13:35.357
Maybe you wanna go play outside?

13:35.441 --> 13:37.818
- Look at the sunset.
- I promise to come see you again.

13:37.902 --> 13:40.112
I'll bring tea and crumpets.

13:40.196 --> 13:41.196
Cool.

13:42.156 --> 13:43.574
I'll be right out.

13:43.657 --> 13:47.745
We arranged all her stuffies
into a petting zoo. It was wonderful.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.294
Nobody's bullying her.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.713
- She's worried about the end of the planet.
- What?

13:57.796 --> 14:00.049
Her class is evidently talking
about climate change,

14:00.132 --> 14:02.510
she's gotten the message
that we're doomed.

14:02.593 --> 14:03.886
- For fuck's sake.
- Oh, my God.

14:03.969 --> 14:07.473
- You gotta be kidding me.
- She's also worried about you going to jail.

14:07.556 --> 14:08.766
Well, hello.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.976
And she's worried about you.

14:11.060 --> 14:12.228
Me?

14:12.311 --> 14:15.606
She thinks something is going on with you
and has been for a long time.

14:16.690 --> 14:21.570
So there's you, you,
mostly the end of the world.

14:22.988 --> 14:26.534
- Do you know if it's wild or farmed?
- I believe it's farmed.

14:26.617 --> 14:29.036
- Land-based or net-pen?
- Sorry?

14:29.119 --> 14:32.456
Were they raised on land-based facilities
or in net-pens in the ocean?

14:32.540 --> 14:36.710
Well, um, it's a fish,
so I'm guessing the ocean.

14:36.794 --> 14:38.087
Could you check?

14:38.963 --> 14:40.923
- Sure.
- Thanks.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.301
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

14:44.385 --> 14:46.554
You have to be careful
with some of the farm shit.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.556
So you just eat wild?

14:48.639 --> 14:51.225
Yeah, yeah, mostly.
There's problems there too.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.936
Some wild fish have tested positive
for microplastics.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.522
Some wild salmon have tested positive
for antidepressants.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.942
People have to ask
where the fish come from,

15:00.025 --> 15:02.736
what they ate, how they lived,
even how they died.

15:02.820 --> 15:07.533
If they're processed post-rigor,
the bacteria can leech right into the flesh.

15:10.619 --> 15:13.956
- Sorry.
- No, you don't have to apologize.

15:14.039 --> 15:17.793
I used to work at Santa Monica Seafood,
so I was really into all this shit.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.421
It's great. And you're teaching me a lot.

15:20.504 --> 15:23.090
- I'm trying to come off intelligent.
- It's working.

15:29.013 --> 15:32.725
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry to be such a nuisance.

15:32.808 --> 15:34.310
But I was just...

15:34.393 --> 15:38.147
I was just wondering if there are any
new developments in the case.

15:39.523 --> 15:43.277
We told you we would call if there were.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.445
Yes.

15:44.528 --> 15:46.155
Mm-hm.

15:46.238 --> 15:50.743
I have personally worked very hard
to be mindful of your unspeakable pain.

15:50.826 --> 15:52.453
I know you care.

15:52.536 --> 15:55.414
I, perhaps, do seek out those who do.

15:55.497 --> 15:59.460
I know you are not allowed
to say anything about the case,

15:59.543 --> 16:02.755
or what you believe, but...

16:06.759 --> 16:07.801
A mother need...

16:09.928 --> 16:11.680
A mother needs to know.

16:14.850 --> 16:18.187
You don't believe my son just slipped.

16:21.774 --> 16:22.774
Do you?

16:25.194 --> 16:29.281
You don't think it's healthy
to cling to the good memories?

16:29.365 --> 16:31.784
It can be. I don't think so here.

16:31.867 --> 16:34.745
But there are so many positives.

16:34.828 --> 16:38.082
So many. The way he loved me,
the way he loved the boys.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.833
The boys loved him. I...

16:41.251 --> 16:45.255
I shouldn't erase all of that
simply because you feel that...

16:45.339 --> 16:47.675
He almost killed you.

16:47.758 --> 16:49.176
He didn't almost kill me.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.762
He nearly smothered you with a cushion.

16:51.845 --> 16:56.266
If one of his kicks had landed on your head,
you might very well be dead.

17:00.270 --> 17:04.273
I work with,
and treat, quite a few veterans.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.109
Many wanna return to combat.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.779
They can't handle the mundane.
Normal life is dull.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.617
You miss the war, Celeste.

17:15.577 --> 17:19.039
I miss what was good.
I don't miss what was bad.

17:19.123 --> 17:23.752
And keeping him in my heart, the good...
The good part of him, that works for me.

17:23.836 --> 17:27.589
It works for the boys.
It works for my family. That works.

17:29.508 --> 17:32.678
How did you get that bruise
on your arm?

17:32.761 --> 17:35.556
- I broke up a fight between the boys.
- Mm-hm.

17:35.639 --> 17:38.100
Last week.
I probably got whacked or something.

17:39.727 --> 17:41.895
Do you self-inflict your bruises?

17:41.979 --> 17:43.939
- What?
- It's not uncommon.

17:44.022 --> 17:49.903
Victims of abuse, sometimes they feel
some attachment to their wounds.

17:51.739 --> 17:53.741
Perhaps they remind you of him.

17:53.824 --> 17:57.327
I do not self-inflict any wounds.

17:58.579 --> 18:02.040
And your other patients
do not inform on me. I'm not a statistic.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.544
Are you an addict, Celeste?

18:05.627 --> 18:07.087
Is Perry your drug?

18:11.091 --> 18:15.345
I think it's really neat
how passionate you are about things.

18:15.429 --> 18:18.390
Thank you.
Are you passionate about things?

18:19.224 --> 18:22.019
Um, yeah, of course, I am. You know, I...

18:22.102 --> 18:25.189
I used to paint a lot.
I was really into art.

18:26.523 --> 18:31.695
Now I'm mostly passionate
about my son.

18:31.779 --> 18:32.654
I have a kid.

18:32.738 --> 18:38.035
I probably should've told you that earlier,
but it's kind of a weird thing to bring up.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.623
He's great. His name is Ziggy.
He's in second grade.

18:42.706 --> 18:43.832
I would love to meet him.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.585
Yeah, maybe one day.

18:47.628 --> 18:52.466
I'm sure you guys would get along great.
He knows a lot of random shit too.

18:52.549 --> 18:56.386
You guys could talk
about a lot of weird facts.

18:59.056 --> 19:00.265
Um...

19:00.349 --> 19:02.434
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:04.019 --> 19:07.439
No, no, it's fine. It's, uh... not you.

19:10.818 --> 19:15.781
I just gotta idle in neutral for a little bit.
That's kind of my MO right now.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.324
- Neutral.
- Yeah.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.202
Okay. I can do that.

19:29.920 --> 19:36.176
I am the greatest

19:37.219 --> 19:38.512
<i>monster.</i>

19:38.595 --> 19:45.310
<i>And I come to devour
two young chickadees!</i>

19:45.978 --> 19:47.813
My heavens.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.276
He was the best monster.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.821
- Show her the angry beaver.
- Yeah, let me see that one.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.948
Did your mom make this for you?

19:58.031 --> 19:59.241
We all did.

20:01.326 --> 20:03.078
He sounds like a bear.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.539
- He liked to combine animals.
- Yeah.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.166
Oh, here's the teacup one.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.877
How we doing here?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.712
We're showing Grandma
the memory book.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.088
It's wonderful.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.425
Here's <i>Guess How Much I Love You.</i>

20:16.508 --> 20:20.178
- That one's kind of boring.
- No, no, no. Let me. I wanna see that one.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.097
We loved that book.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.724
Okay.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.935
<i>"He was almost too sleepy
to think anymore.</i>

20:27.019 --> 20:31.732
<i>Then he looked beyond the thorn bushes,
out into the big dark night.</i>

20:33.066 --> 20:35.986
<i>Nothing could be farther than the sky.</i>

20:36.069 --> 20:41.283
<i>'I love you right up to the moon, ' he said,
and closed his eyes.</i>

20:41.366 --> 20:46.038
<i>'Oh, that's far. That is very, very far.'</i>

20:46.121 --> 20:50.709
<i>Big Nutbrown Hare settled
Little Nutbrown Hare into his bed of leaves.</i>

20:50.792 --> 20:54.046
<i>He leaned over and kissed him good night.
Right on the forehead."</i>

21:09.895 --> 21:11.647
Chloe said Amabella had a stroke.

21:11.730 --> 21:14.691
She didn't have a stroke.
She had a panic attack. They're different.

21:14.775 --> 21:16.902
She's totally okay.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.738
And Max thinks
she got possessed by Satan.

21:19.821 --> 21:24.534
You can tell Max that he's wrong because
Satan can only be so many places at once.

21:25.786 --> 21:27.746
Come on, get in the car.

21:27.829 --> 21:30.165
Let's go. Please get in the car.

21:30.248 --> 21:31.248
Ziggy.

21:39.716 --> 21:45.847
<i>♪ Gotta find a way to get home strong
Gotta find a way back home ♪</i>

21:51.311 --> 21:54.523
<i>♪ Gotta find a light to guide me along ♪</i>

21:54.606 --> 21:57.818
<i>♪ Gotta find a way back home ♪</i>

22:02.906 --> 22:06.159
<i>♪ Running for your life
won't get you so far ♪</i>

22:06.243 --> 22:09.287
<i>♪ Running for your life so far ♪</i>

22:12.874 --> 22:15.877
<i>- That's Perry's brother, Raymond?
- Yes.</i>

22:15.961 --> 22:19.464
- Oh, my God, he looks like Ziggy.
- It's uncanny, isn't it?

22:22.009 --> 22:22.884
Oh, my God.

22:22.968 --> 22:24.302
Wait, look.

22:25.804 --> 22:27.973
They have the same cheeks.
That's crazy.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.641
Wow.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.268
It's...

22:32.144 --> 22:34.771
a bit unsettling.

22:34.855 --> 22:37.399
I should like to be in Ziggy's life. I...

22:38.984 --> 22:42.529
I mean, I'm... I'm his grandmother.

22:42.612 --> 22:43.864
Yeah.

22:43.947 --> 22:47.576
I just needed a... Some time
to wrestle with that idea, but...

22:47.659 --> 22:48.702
Is he sweet?

22:51.705 --> 22:52.998
Yeah.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.458
He's the best.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.501
My boys were so sweet.

22:57.586 --> 23:04.551
I don't think there was a gentler
or more tender little boy than Perry.

23:06.553 --> 23:10.390
He was so sweet and gentle.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.603
Grew up to be neither.

23:17.439 --> 23:20.650
This is perhaps an unfair question.

23:20.734 --> 23:26.782
On the night of your rendezvous
with my son, who initiated the encounter?

23:28.950 --> 23:32.454
Uh... Does that make a difference?

23:32.537 --> 23:36.750
I know how devoted he was to Celeste,

23:36.833 --> 23:41.296
and I... I just can't conceive how he...

23:41.379 --> 23:43.799
Unless he was tempted.

23:43.882 --> 23:47.302
As men can be in a moment of weakness.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.721
Did you initiate, Jane?

23:50.972 --> 23:51.972
No.

23:55.644 --> 23:58.063
You trying to apologize on his behalf?

23:58.146 --> 24:00.565
To just justify what he did?

24:00.649 --> 24:02.692
Celeste has shared with me

24:02.776 --> 24:08.031
that she and Perry had a...
A complicated sex life,

24:08.115 --> 24:11.076
- one that included violence.
- She shared that with you?

24:12.285 --> 24:13.787
Yes.

24:13.870 --> 24:14.996
And I'm...

24:15.080 --> 24:18.166
It makes me wonder
if, perhaps, he misinterpreted

24:18.250 --> 24:20.919
or misread a signal from you.

24:22.212 --> 24:28.218
Your son raped me, and as he was doing so,
I was screaming for him to get off.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.849
I don't think that you misread that.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.770
I don't mean to offend you, I just...

24:38.854 --> 24:43.233
It... I can't surrender to this notion
that he was...

24:46.570 --> 24:48.655
evil. I can't...

24:50.991 --> 24:54.828
I just do so wanna believe
there was good in him.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.538
I can't.

24:56.621 --> 24:58.415
Did you see good in him?

24:59.457 --> 25:04.337
Before the bad...
Did you see good in him?

25:43.585 --> 25:46.880
It's literally like it couldn't be dumber.

25:46.963 --> 25:48.798
I know. I know.

25:48.882 --> 25:50.800
- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

25:52.177 --> 25:53.595
Yeah, I'm good. Good.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.430
What are you doing?

25:55.513 --> 25:57.307
Just, um, chatting.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.476
Having some coffee.
What's up with you?

26:01.144 --> 26:04.105
- You look better. Brighter.
- Thanks.

26:10.654 --> 26:13.073
Um, I should get going to the studio.

26:13.156 --> 26:15.367
Yeah, I'll let you guys...

26:15.450 --> 26:16.910
All right.

26:16.993 --> 26:19.412
Thanks for the chat and the laugh.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.081
- Totally.
- I needed that, so...

26:21.790 --> 26:23.208
- Good to see you.
- You too.

26:23.291 --> 26:24.376
Bye.

26:24.459 --> 26:25.961
- Bye, Maddie.
- Okay, bye.

26:28.255 --> 26:30.257
I should probably get going too, here.

26:30.340 --> 26:33.051
So, what were you talking about?

26:33.134 --> 26:34.719
Her, uh, mother.

26:36.096 --> 26:38.682
It seems everyone has mother issues.

26:42.018 --> 26:43.770
How long are you gonna punish me?

26:44.980 --> 26:49.859
Well, for as long as I need
or want, I guess.

26:49.943 --> 26:52.237
Wow, that was just cold and mean

26:52.320 --> 26:56.199
when just a few seconds ago,
you were so warm and friendly with Bonnie.

26:56.283 --> 26:58.702
Yeah, I guess that would be a twofer,
wouldn't it?

26:58.785 --> 27:01.538
Could piss off both you and Nathan
at the same time.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.248
That's a good idea.

27:04.874 --> 27:07.419
Well, that's just cruel, Ed.

27:07.502 --> 27:09.546
And you're not cruel.

27:09.629 --> 27:16.629
Well, whatever I am or have been
hasn't netted the desired results,

27:16.720 --> 27:18.596
so why not mix it up?

27:22.809 --> 27:24.769
<i>I don't even know who he is right now.</i>

27:24.853 --> 27:26.771
He'll play through it. He will.

27:26.855 --> 27:28.189
He just...

27:29.316 --> 27:31.401
He's just being so hateful.

27:31.484 --> 27:33.653
How could I think
anything about my life is real?

27:33.737 --> 27:36.072
My first marriage was not real.

27:37.157 --> 27:39.075
My second marriage,
turns out I'm the fraud.

27:39.159 --> 27:44.039
I can't even believe in myself anymore,
and, like, look at my friendships and...

27:45.373 --> 27:49.794
- What about your friendships?
- I had no clue, Celeste.

27:49.878 --> 27:53.089
I didn't even have the slightest idea
that you were living through that,

27:53.173 --> 27:55.425
and it makes me feel
like you couldn't even tell me.

27:55.508 --> 27:58.261
- I'm sorry for keeping this secret. But I am.
- Don't say sorry.

27:58.345 --> 28:01.931
- It's...
- If I was in your situation, I probably...

28:02.015 --> 28:05.518
Probably what? Would have done
the same thing as me? Hmm?

28:05.602 --> 28:08.438
- No, Madeline, you wouldn't.
- I don't know.

28:08.521 --> 28:12.233
You would have been out of that marriage
so fast.

28:12.317 --> 28:13.360
I wish.

28:13.443 --> 28:16.029
I wish I had told you. I do.

28:19.074 --> 28:21.534
You would have jumped into that pool,
pulled me out.

28:26.414 --> 28:29.000
What possesses two idiots
like yourselves

28:29.084 --> 28:31.669
to teach 8-year-olds
that the planet is doomed?

28:31.753 --> 28:35.507
The children are constantly bombarded
with climate change. It is all over the news.

28:35.590 --> 28:39.094
It's our job to deconstruct it
so that they can process it.

28:39.177 --> 28:42.597
Good for you. You deconstructed
my little girl into a coma.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.141
Renata, look,
we scheduled an assembly for this evening.

28:45.225 --> 28:47.685
Okay?
You are not the only parent complaining.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.604
Just, by far, the loudest.

28:50.647 --> 28:51.523
You're pitiful.

28:51.606 --> 28:54.692
Okay, this is gonna come
as a shock to you.

28:54.776 --> 29:01.199
This school is actually here to serve
all the children, not just Amabella.

29:01.282 --> 29:04.327
You think
because of this whole bankruptcy thing

29:04.411 --> 29:06.746
that the school thinks I don't matter?

29:06.830 --> 29:08.081
Please.

29:08.164 --> 29:09.624
I will be rich again.

29:09.707 --> 29:10.875
I will rise up.

29:10.959 --> 29:14.504
I will buy a fucking polar bear
for every kid in this school.

29:14.587 --> 29:18.216
And then I will squish you
like the bug that you are.

29:18.299 --> 29:21.719
Pretends like he's not a smoker.
Hasn't been laid in 15 fucking years.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.221
Don't you talk to me like that.

29:23.304 --> 29:26.015
And you,
I can't be bothered to squish you.

29:26.099 --> 29:28.268
You're a model citizen, Renata.

29:28.351 --> 29:31.104
I told you, these second-grade mothers,
they are Shakespearean.

29:32.147 --> 29:35.608
That woman,
she's the fucking Medusa of Monterey.

29:35.692 --> 29:38.653
- And, yes, I smoke. Do you want one of these?
- Yes, please.

29:38.736 --> 29:41.573
Yeah, I got a spot outside
where the kids can't fucking see us.

29:41.656 --> 29:44.117
- Fuck them. Oh, my God, I am so livid.
- Okay, let's...

29:44.200 --> 29:46.828
- I am so livid.
- Let's go get a coffee or something.

29:46.911 --> 29:50.331
- Please. The teacher was in on it.
- He really said, "Go to hell"?

29:50.415 --> 29:51.791
- Yeah, he's a shit.
- Oh, my God.

29:51.875 --> 29:55.712
They practically kill my daughter,
and then he's just dismissing me like that?

29:55.795 --> 29:58.715
- What a puss-fuck. And then...
- Okay.

29:58.798 --> 30:01.217
Mary Louise. Did you find a place?

30:01.301 --> 30:03.720
- Maybe. Just saw one.
- Good, good, good.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.346
You know Renata Klein?

30:05.430 --> 30:06.681
- We do...
- Don't believe I do.

30:06.764 --> 30:09.100
We... We did meet. At the funeral.

30:09.184 --> 30:12.645
I'm so sorry. I was a friend of Perry's.

30:12.729 --> 30:15.106
You were there. When he fell.

30:16.191 --> 30:19.277
I was. That was, uh, devastating.

30:20.737 --> 30:22.238
Mm-hm.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.823
So sorry to interrupt.

30:25.074 --> 30:26.618
Come on. Let's get out of here.

30:26.701 --> 30:29.537
- What the fuck is that?
- I don't know. She's very strange.

30:29.913 --> 30:31.247
Whoo!

30:32.373 --> 30:33.791
Jane.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.210
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:35.293 --> 30:37.045
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

30:37.128 --> 30:38.505
- Going for a run.
- How are you?

30:38.588 --> 30:41.716
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm good. Oh, my gosh, that's so funny.

30:41.799 --> 30:44.052
Ziggy's learning to surf.
Corey's teaching him.

30:44.135 --> 30:46.095
- This is getting kind of serious.
- No.

30:46.179 --> 30:49.390
Told Ziggy about him and told him
that he was teaching me to surf,

30:49.474 --> 30:52.101
- so, of course, he wanted to learn.
- Yeah.

30:52.185 --> 30:54.938
Yeah. He did try to kiss me
the other night, though.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.649
- And?
- It was extremely awkward.

30:57.732 --> 31:00.777
I don't know. My body just shut down.

31:00.860 --> 31:03.947
- Does he know about your history?
- Mm-mm. Not yet.

31:04.030 --> 31:07.033
- You should talk to him.
- I don't know if I'm ready for that.

31:08.159 --> 31:12.205
Look, any real relationship
you're gonna have, if you wanna have one,

31:12.288 --> 31:16.251
- he's gotta know who you are, right?
- Yeah. I guess that's true.

31:19.087 --> 31:20.255
What?

31:21.464 --> 31:25.093
I'm such a hypocrite.
Nathan has no idea who I am.

31:27.262 --> 31:30.139
Oh, my God! Go, Ziggy!
Go, baby, yes! Stand up!

31:30.223 --> 31:33.142
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
You're doing it!

31:38.481 --> 31:39.941
Turn that shit off.

31:46.531 --> 31:50.368
Three things. One, we're throwing Amabella
a birthday party, and I'm sparing no cost.

31:50.451 --> 31:51.786
She's unhappy.

31:51.869 --> 31:54.872
Two, I had it out with Nippal.
I've gotta go back to the school.

31:54.956 --> 31:58.042
They wanna talk about climate change
and the end of the world, which,

31:58.126 --> 32:00.753
- if it comes, it might be a sweet relief.
- Damn right.

32:00.837 --> 32:04.299
- And three, sell your fucking toys.
- It's not just me, you know.

32:04.382 --> 32:06.801
- Excuse me?
- Putting stress on Amabella.

32:06.884 --> 32:09.387
- What I did didn't help, of course, but...
- What did I do?

32:09.470 --> 32:10.470
You tell me.

32:12.140 --> 32:16.185
I mean, when I first met you, you had
your guardrails up to your earlobes.

32:16.269 --> 32:18.438
- Please.
- Penetrating you was like...

32:18.521 --> 32:20.523
It was like piercing a cement wall.

32:20.607 --> 32:23.818
It took some time,
but I eventually chipped through, you know.

32:23.901 --> 32:27.947
Well, guess what? The last, I don't know,
12 months or so, the guardrails are back up.

32:28.031 --> 32:30.074
You are here, you're there,
you're everywhere,

32:30.158 --> 32:34.162
but you are never present, and I feel it.

32:34.245 --> 32:36.080
And Amabella feels it.

32:37.248 --> 32:39.500
- Did she say that?
- I'm saying it.

32:39.584 --> 32:41.419
Your husband is saying it.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.716
There is something going on with you.

32:48.051 --> 32:49.344
Correct.

32:49.427 --> 32:52.472
My husband put us in the poorhouse.

32:52.555 --> 32:53.806
Sell your shit.

32:55.433 --> 32:59.354
First off, thank you all
for coming to a special evening assembly

32:59.437 --> 33:02.440
at our wonderful, wonderful Otter Bay.

33:02.523 --> 33:07.445
And a special thanks to those parents who
took special time out of their busy lives

33:07.528 --> 33:10.823
to reach out to me directly
about this important issue, so thank you.

33:10.907 --> 33:12.700
You're welcome. Yeah.

33:12.784 --> 33:17.080
Now, as we all know,
anxiety is an epidemic in our schools.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.624
Really? It wouldn't be
if you weren't teaching them...

33:19.707 --> 33:23.044
Let's take a breath, and let's try
and keep this constructive, shall we?

33:23.127 --> 33:27.423
Climate change
and the toll that it takes on our students,

33:27.507 --> 33:29.384
it is a complicated matter, okay?

33:29.467 --> 33:33.054
That is why we called this ad hoc
Golden Bell Award-winning assembly

33:33.137 --> 33:36.933
because not only will you hear from me,
we would love to hear from you,

33:37.016 --> 33:39.268
the parents. Okay, hold up.

33:39.352 --> 33:42.063
We've already told you
how we feel about it.

33:42.146 --> 33:45.817
This is not how I want this to go.
Everyone, please sit down.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.026
Shut up!

33:47.110 --> 33:50.446
Really?
Are you seriously telling us to shut up?

33:50.530 --> 33:51.531
Madeline Mackenzie.

33:51.614 --> 33:55.618
Okay, since you've taken this opportunity
to speak up, let us first hear from you.

33:55.702 --> 33:58.538
- Would you like to come up here, please?
- Why me?

33:58.621 --> 34:00.998
Because you're a beacon among us,
Madeline.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.251
- Please, come up here. Thank you.
- Fine. I'm fine.

34:03.334 --> 34:05.503
Make sure they know
my daughter was in a coma.

34:05.586 --> 34:06.671
Okay. Okay, yeah.

34:06.754 --> 34:09.132
Madeline Mackenzie, everyone.
Please.

34:14.011 --> 34:15.722
Just share your thoughts.

34:18.558 --> 34:21.351
I mean, where do we even begin? Honestly?

34:21.436 --> 34:23.771
About everything?

34:24.938 --> 34:27.692
I mean, Principal Nippal,
you have a very good point.

34:27.775 --> 34:30.445
Climate change is important.
It's important.

34:30.527 --> 34:34.031
But it's also a lot to load up
on a lot of second graders. I'm sorry.

34:34.114 --> 34:37.201
- Yes.
- That the whole world might go kapooey.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.911
They need to know that?

34:38.995 --> 34:42.915
You know, I think part of the problem is,
we lie to our kids.

34:42.998 --> 34:47.003
We fill their heads full of Santa Claus
and stories with happy endings,

34:47.085 --> 34:51.174
when most of us know
most endings to most stories fucking suck.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.176
Right? Let's just get real.

34:54.427 --> 34:57.388
There aren't a lot of happy endings
for a lot of people, you know?

34:57.472 --> 35:00.975
Be it climate change,
be it guns in schools.

35:01.851 --> 35:04.645
And our kids are afraid.
They're afraid to go to school.

35:04.729 --> 35:06.647
They're afraid they're gonna get shot.

35:06.731 --> 35:08.107
We don't prepare them.

35:08.191 --> 35:12.779
We fill their heads full of happy endings
and happy stories and lies.

35:13.988 --> 35:19.202
And we tell them things like, "You're fine.
You're gonna be fine," we tell ourselves...

35:19.285 --> 35:22.663
We tell ourselves we're gonna be fine.
But we're not.

35:24.207 --> 35:27.835
You know that song we used to sing when
we were little, "The Rainbow Connection"?

35:27.919 --> 35:30.922
There's a line in it,
they talk about rainbows are illusions.

35:31.005 --> 35:35.301
And then there's another line,
and it goes on, and it says that,

35:35.384 --> 35:42.384
"Who said every wish would be granted
would be if you wish on a morning star."

35:42.475 --> 35:44.477
Do you remember that?

35:44.560 --> 35:46.896
Because this is the part that I thought...

35:48.898 --> 35:51.067
is that somebody thought of that.

35:52.652 --> 35:55.071
That someone believed them.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.448
And look what it's done.

35:57.532 --> 36:00.451
We have to tell the children
that life is an illusion

36:00.535 --> 36:02.745
and things don't work out sometimes,

36:02.829 --> 36:05.706
and that you can't tell them
part of the truth.

36:05.790 --> 36:08.125
You have to tell them the whole truth.

36:18.678 --> 36:20.888
She's not picking up.

36:20.972 --> 36:24.767
Is this a full-blown breakdown
or something? I mean...

36:24.851 --> 36:27.520
Too much to get up there
and help her, Ed?

36:28.271 --> 36:33.150
- Hmm? She's your fucking wife.
- Well, thanks for the tip, Celeste.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.278
Maybe we could get coffee, you and me,

36:35.361 --> 36:38.614
and you could fill me in
on whatever else I've missed.

36:41.909 --> 36:44.620
You don't think he knows about...?

36:44.704 --> 36:45.704
No.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.722
Where is he?

37:02.805 --> 37:03.805
I don't know.

37:05.516 --> 37:06.726
Is he moving out?

37:08.895 --> 37:11.230
Well, he hasn't packed his things yet.

37:21.574 --> 37:23.034
Well, I heard...

37:24.368 --> 37:26.787
about your speech tonight.

37:26.871 --> 37:28.623
Can you get me some wine?

37:31.375 --> 37:32.375
He'll be back.

37:37.673 --> 37:39.133
Thank you, honey.

37:49.060 --> 37:51.646
- What are you doing?
- Oh, sweet Jesus.

37:51.729 --> 37:54.023
You gave me such a fright.

37:54.106 --> 37:55.106
Well...

37:56.192 --> 37:57.735
Okay, I won't lie.

37:57.818 --> 37:59.737
I have been having trouble
sleeping of late,

37:59.820 --> 38:03.866
and so I thought
you might have a little helper or two.

38:03.950 --> 38:04.951
You're snooping.

38:05.034 --> 38:07.912
You have quite an impressive array.

38:11.415 --> 38:13.876
I think it's probably best
if you find another place.

38:13.960 --> 38:16.754
Celeste, I am on your side.

38:16.837 --> 38:19.340
So you keep saying.

38:19.423 --> 38:21.342
Vicodin?

38:21.425 --> 38:24.804
You have to be so careful
of these opioids, dear.

38:24.887 --> 38:26.305
Sometimes I needed it.

38:27.682 --> 38:28.891
For the pain.

38:35.815 --> 38:37.733
Like when after he kicked me.

38:47.451 --> 38:49.453
I had a really good time again.

38:59.714 --> 39:01.632
I'm not gonna try and kiss you.

39:04.135 --> 39:07.096
But I would like to give you
a good-night hug.

39:08.264 --> 39:09.932
How does that sound?

39:10.016 --> 39:11.142
That sounds great.

39:15.438 --> 39:18.190
- Okay.
- This is a weird hug.

39:22.319 --> 39:24.113
We're touching.

39:24.196 --> 39:25.322
I'm blushing.

39:25.406 --> 39:26.406
How's it going?

39:29.660 --> 39:30.661
Are we dancing?

39:30.745 --> 39:35.207
Is that what this is? Is that your secret
scheme? To get me to dance with you?

39:35.291 --> 39:36.667
It's a really good idea, yeah.

39:36.751 --> 39:40.755
I'm not that smooth, but, yeah, I guess
we could dance if you want to dance, sure.

39:59.857 --> 40:01.067
<i>Hey, Sparkles.</i>

40:02.943 --> 40:05.488

40:20.377 --> 40:22.338

40:24.632 --> 40:26.967

40:27.051 --> 40:29.053
