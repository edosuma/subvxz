00:10.544 --> 00:12.646
Excuse me, does
Dan Conner work here?

00:12.680 --> 00:16.150
No, he's the boss.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.685
Uh-- I'm Phyllis Zimmer.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.853
I'm an old friend of
Danny's from high school.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.355
Do you think he'd be
OK if I went in there?

00:21.389 --> 00:23.324
OK, but don't
make too much noise.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.492
I just put him down for his nap.

00:32.366 --> 00:37.771
Oh, my god, it's Dan
Connor, the big football star.

00:37.805 --> 00:41.909
I think he looked at me.

00:41.942 --> 00:42.743
Phyllis Zimmer.

00:46.180 --> 00:49.983
My god, what in the
world are you doing here?

00:50.017 --> 00:52.086
Well, I'm in town
for a couple of days.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.522
And I was driving by the school.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.291
And I got to thinking
about old times.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.193
You look terrific.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.694
Thanks.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.530
You look exactly the same.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.364
No, I don't.

01:10.138 --> 01:12.306
So, uh-- you in
charge of this place?

01:12.340 --> 01:14.908
Oh, yeah, this is my
office, desk, chair.

01:14.942 --> 01:18.379
I usually wear a tie,
but today it was dirty.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.314
Very impressive.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.582
Who's that.

01:21.615 --> 01:25.453
Nobody-- but my family.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.421
Very nice.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.357
I see you're still
married to Roseanne.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.824
Oh, yeah.

01:30.858 --> 01:31.659
She's great.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.233
Am Am I making
you uncomfortable?

01:39.267 --> 01:42.736
I mean, you know,
because of our thing?

01:42.770 --> 01:45.606
Oh, come on, hey, hey,
that was 25 years ago.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.475
We were in high school.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.109
Me and Roseanne were
broke up at the time.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.914
Roseanne ever
find out about us?

01:53.947 --> 01:57.117
Yeah, false,
false, crown, bridge.

02:03.791 --> 02:07.395
I guess she probably wouldn't
want us to go to lunch then?

02:07.428 --> 02:08.596
No, she wouldn't care.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.367
She'd be OK.

02:17.705 --> 02:18.506
She wouldn't mind.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.976
- She could come with us.
- Yes, she could.

02:23.010 --> 02:23.877
She could.

02:23.911 --> 02:24.945
I could her and she could come.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.148
But she's working.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.183
Then it's just you and me.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.984
I guess so.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.886
Hey, we could go to
that place we used to go.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.023
Well, under the bleachers
is an unusual spot for lunch,

02:36.056 --> 02:38.492
but, hey, what the hell.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.994
[nervous laughter]

02:41.028 --> 02:44.932
[theme music playing]

03:31.812 --> 03:33.281
Hey, Jackie.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.181
Hi, Fred.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.015
Think fast.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.552
Earrings.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.622
No, I can't take these from you.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.523
Come on.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.857
I saw them in a store.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.726
And they just, I don't know,
made me think of your ears.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.299
What?

03:51.332 --> 03:53.967
What about them?

03:54.001 --> 03:55.068
They're just petite, you know.

03:55.102 --> 03:55.969
Delicate.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.705
Oh, oh, well, thanks.

04:02.009 --> 04:05.012
Can't really take
credit for that.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.947
Although I have always tried
to sleep on them evenly.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.920
Well, I guess,
I'll see you around.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.155
You know, Fred,
maybe if we went

04:15.188 --> 04:18.158
out to dinner again sometime,
it wouldn't be that bad

04:18.191 --> 04:19.560
Really?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.962
So if I asked you to go out with
me tonight at 8:00 for dinner,

04:21.995 --> 04:23.564
you'd say yes?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.032
Yeah, I would.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.100
It's good to know.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.737
Fred.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.638
8 o'clock.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.073
Yeah, deal.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.309
So what's Dan doing today.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.311
Oh, he's having lunch with
an old friend from high school.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.211
Oh, yeah?

04:38.245 --> 04:39.112
Who?

04:39.146 --> 04:40.013
Maybe I know him.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.615
I think it was Phyllis Zimmer.

04:41.649 --> 04:46.454
Oh, my god, really?

04:46.487 --> 04:50.591
No, maybe not if it's
going to get Dan in trouble.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.292
Well, it could.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.894
They slept together
in high school.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.128
If Roseanne finds
out about this,

04:55.162 --> 04:56.096
she is going to freak out.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.399
Well, she doesn't
have to find out.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.267
Well, I can't
lie to my sister.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.869
I don't think
it would be wrong.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.004
No, I mean I can't
lie to my sister.

05:04.037 --> 05:04.905
I always try.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.106
She can always tell.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.775
ROSEANNE: Jackie,
come here a minute.

05:07.808 --> 05:08.642
I'm busy.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.077
ROSEANNE: No you're not.

05:10.110 --> 05:10.911
See.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.049
Hi, Fred.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.150
Where's Dan?

05:17.184 --> 05:20.020
Well, hey, look
what Fred gave me.

05:20.053 --> 05:23.290
Says he stop thinking
about my ears.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.692
That's sweet, isn't it?

05:24.725 --> 05:27.361
Just what you want to hear from
somebody who's seen you naked.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.472
So Fred, how come Dan
didn't come down with you?

05:38.506 --> 05:40.374
Well, Dan couldn't
come because he

05:40.408 --> 05:45.245
had to have lunch at a seminar.

05:45.278 --> 05:48.716
Had go to a motor
seminar in DeKalb,

05:48.749 --> 05:55.222
a seminar on all the motors
that they'll be using.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.157
Well, Fred, how come
you didn't go with him?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.225
Who?
Fred?

05:58.258 --> 06:02.295
Well, Fred-- Fred
was going to go and--

06:02.329 --> 06:03.130
Fred.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.034
It's only for bosses.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.506
Well, I guess Dan
finally gets to lead

06:12.540 --> 06:16.544
that glamorous powerful life
that he's always dreamed of.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.646
I feel just like Jackie Kennedy.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.482
[music playing]

06:26.854 --> 06:28.789
Hey, Jackie.

06:28.822 --> 06:29.623
Dan.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.896
Roseanne's in the kitchen.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.098
Chicken's in the fridge.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.199
No, no, that's OK.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.067
I already had lunch.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.038
Usual place.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.575
I always eat at the same place.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.844
I'm very loyal that way.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.680
I'm a very loyal luncher.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.452
What exactly are we
saying about lunch, Jackie?

06:58.486 --> 07:00.921
I know, Dan.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.155
Ah, jeez.

07:04.825 --> 07:05.726
What happened?

07:05.759 --> 07:06.860
What do you mean
what happened?

07:06.894 --> 07:09.096
Nothing happened.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.130
All right, I believe you.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.065
But it was still
really, really bad.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.334
You took out the one woman in
the world Roseanne never wanted

07:14.367 --> 07:15.769
you to see you again to lunch.

07:15.803 --> 07:16.970
How could you that?
- I don't know.

07:17.004 --> 07:17.871
It was noon.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.340
I was hungry.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.075
Remember how nuts she
went when she found out what

07:22.109 --> 07:23.010
you guys did in high school?

07:23.043 --> 07:24.377
Yeah, I do.

07:24.411 --> 07:25.846
And we're not going to put her
through that again, are we?

07:25.879 --> 07:27.014
No, of course not.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.282
Dan, Roseanne is very
sensitive about this.

07:29.316 --> 07:32.285
And we know how dangerous she
is when she gets sensitive.

07:32.319 --> 07:35.923
So if you don't tell her,
then there's no problem.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.992
Yeah, there is because you
made me lie to my sister.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.328
Ah, man, you lied to here.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.696
She always knows
when you lie to her.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.598
It's OK.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.500
Told her a really
good one this time.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.935
ROSEANNE: Jackie, is that you?

07:47.968 --> 07:50.738
What are you doing?

07:50.771 --> 07:53.607
I'm watching
the game with Dan.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.441
Go team.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.648
[tv in background]

08:00.681 --> 08:03.651
You are the worst.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.318
ROSEANNE: Jackie, get in here.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.754
What did you tell her

08:06.787 --> 08:09.990
I told her that you went
to Elgin to a motor seminar.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.124
What the hell
is a motor seminar

08:11.158 --> 08:12.025
I don't know.

08:12.059 --> 08:12.926
Ask Roseanne.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.094
She's the one that bought it.

08:18.365 --> 08:21.702
Oh Milky Way bars
in the pudding.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.804
What's the occasion?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.706
Oh, Dan did the
coolest thing, you know.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.275
Right after he finished
with that motor seminar,

08:28.308 --> 08:29.577
he came right home.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.844
He called in sick.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.980
And we spent the whole
afternoon, you know, doing it.

08:37.217 --> 08:40.087
He had sex with
you after that?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.589
Oh, yeah, but it
wasn't just sex.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.758
It was the best sex we
have ever had since--

08:44.792 --> 08:47.761
uh-- since we
started having sex.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.735
God.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.604
Oh, chill out, Jackie.

08:56.637 --> 09:00.007
It's not like I told you that
we did it in here or nothing.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.376
We did it in here.

09:03.410 --> 09:04.812
Hey, girls.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.580
What are you talking about?

09:06.614 --> 09:08.081
Well, we're talking about you.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.016
Really?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.417
Yeah, I was just
telling Jackie

09:10.450 --> 09:12.485
how you were showing
me all that stuff

09:12.519 --> 09:15.222
that you learned about motors.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.557
Vroom, vroom.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.860
Oh, yeah, that trip to
Elgin really paid off.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.598
I thought you said
it was in DeKalb.

09:30.537 --> 09:31.605
Jackie said it was DeKalb?

09:31.639 --> 09:34.141
No, no, motor seminars
are always in Elgin.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.142
What were you thinking?

09:35.175 --> 09:37.077
I don't know.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.045
Elgin?

09:38.078 --> 09:39.512
DeKalb?

09:39.546 --> 09:41.749
See, it was originally
scheduled for DeKalb

09:41.782 --> 09:42.750
And they moved it.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.351
Oh, they moved to
Elgin from DeKalb.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.418
That's-- that explains it.

09:49.990 --> 09:53.627
I totally believe everything
that you guys are saying.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.996
See, that makes liars
of all three of us.

09:58.799 --> 09:59.599
OK.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.540
Dan and I were planning
a big surprise party

10:07.574 --> 10:09.509
for your birthday last month.

10:09.542 --> 10:13.113
I'm so bad at this.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.715
Look, Rosie.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.650
Jackie thought she
could help me by lying.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.586
But the whole thing
is no big deal.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.889
I had lunch with an old friend
who was passing through town.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.123
We talked about
you the whole time.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.024
You remember Phyllis Zimmer.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.793
God, she really likes you.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.869
DAN: Honey, it was only lunch.

10:35.903 --> 10:36.770
Honey?

10:36.804 --> 10:40.373
Oh, god, this is really bad.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.408
Yeah, I know.

10:41.441 --> 10:42.309
[door slams]

10:42.342 --> 10:44.812
Oh, no, this is really bad.

10:44.845 --> 10:45.713
I'm parked behind her.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.821
Oh, man, Rosie's
never left before.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.588
Well, never would
have happened if he

10:55.622 --> 10:58.391
hadn't been with another woman.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.760
Been with?

10:59.793 --> 11:01.862
I had lunch with Phyllis.
- And?

11:01.895 --> 11:03.964
And you lied about it badly.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.034
And you came home and
had sex with Roseanne.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.569
How do you think
that made her feel?

11:09.602 --> 11:11.839
Pretty damn happy
judging from this pudding.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.474
No, it was humiliating.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.109
Dan, you were thinking
about Phyllis while you

11:16.143 --> 11:17.477
were having sex with Roseanne.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.088
Oh, that is just
completely totally not true.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.623
So there's no
connection at all

11:30.657 --> 11:32.760
between you having
lunch with Phyllis today

11:32.793 --> 11:34.094
and having sex with Roseanne.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.528
For your
information, Jackie, I

11:35.562 --> 11:37.831
have had sex with Roseanne
many times without having lunch

11:37.865 --> 11:39.032
with Phyllis.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.467
So your whole theory goes
right out the window.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.970
OK, I just got one question.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.171
If you're completely
innocent, you

11:44.204 --> 11:45.873
did nothing wrong, why do
you think your wife just

11:45.906 --> 11:48.475
stormed out that door.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.544
Why are you here?

11:51.578 --> 11:52.679
You don't live here.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.247
You're not married to
anyone in this house.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.648
Why don't you go out that door.

11:55.682 --> 11:56.984
Get a life of your own.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.952
Then you can screw that up
instead of messing with mine.

12:12.599 --> 12:15.535
You want to know
how innocent I am?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.670
I coulda.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.039
Coulda what?

12:19.072 --> 12:20.407
She wanted me, Jackie.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.945
How do you know that?

12:24.978 --> 12:27.480
Men know.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.615
She did the eyelash thing.

12:28.648 --> 12:29.549
She did the hip thing.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.452
She did all the things.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.187
I could have had her
right then and there,

12:34.221 --> 12:36.123
but I never even
thought about it.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.158
You could have had her.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.260
The Ramada was
right next door.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.796
The vacancy sign was on.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.564
If I was a different
kind of guy,

12:44.597 --> 12:47.134
I could have had lunch,
Phyllis, a quick shower,

12:47.167 --> 12:48.368
and been back at work by 2:00.

12:52.572 --> 12:55.809
Well, it's a good thing
you never thought about it.

Where is Mom.

13:10.690 --> 13:11.791
I need breakfast.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.965
She's not in the bedroom?

13:17.998 --> 13:19.632
No I don't think
she slept here.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.235
The bed's not messed up.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.571
Oh, don't be silly DJ.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.940
You know how sometimes your
mom sleeps on the floor

13:26.974 --> 13:28.208
because she didn't
want to make the bed.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.080
Come on, I'll cook
you breakfast.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.181
You don't know how to cook.

I'll barbecue your breakfast.

the movie "Rocky"?

13:46.326 --> 13:49.062
Mom didn't come home, did she?

13:49.096 --> 13:51.598
DJ, you need to eat
some healthy food.

13:51.631 --> 13:55.668
Hey, how about some
cream style corn.

13:55.702 --> 13:57.104
I'm not hungry.

13:57.137 --> 14:00.640
I know we can have mommy's
pudding for breakfast.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.743
It's fortified with Milky Ways.

14:03.776 --> 14:07.180
Why won't you tell
me where mom is?

14:07.214 --> 14:13.053
DJ, your mom and I had
a little fight last night.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.621
You guys always fight.

I messed up pretty good.

I don't know how I could

Well, Dan you couldn't
know that Roseanne

15:06.706 --> 15:08.008
would react so badly.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.109
We've been
married long enough.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.910
I should know exactly
how she'd react.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.612
Then why did you go
to lunch with Phyllis?

15:16.316 --> 15:17.650
Because she walked
in and it was like I

15:17.684 --> 15:18.685
was 20 years younger.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.158
It just felt good.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.027
Not many people make me
feel that way anymore.

The last few years, I've just
felt so damned resistible.

Dan, that's crazy.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.401
Yeah, well, whatever.

Dan, there's a lot of women

Yeah, right.

tail was used quite often.

now you got cable.

16:30.557 --> 16:35.395
Dan-- he's worried
sick about where you are.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.763
He just feels horrible.

16:36.796 --> 16:37.730
Cool.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.300
No, he feels
really, really bad.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.036
I-- it's kind of
a midlife thing.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.971
Guys get to this
point in their life

16:45.004 --> 16:47.474
where they have to
bolster their ego.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.242
It's just not unhealthy.

16:49.276 --> 16:52.345
It can be a natural phase
in a loving relationship.

What are you doing?

Oh, wait a minute,
that's not Oprah.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.322
That's you.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.125
He just wanted somebody
to think he was attractive.

Oh, poor boy, Dan doesn't
think he's attractive.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.366

Dan's attractive either.

may, Jackie, not all

or two of them that would be

punished Dan enough?

Phyllis all afternoon--

17:42.795 --> 17:45.198
He didn't have
sex with Phyllis.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.099
Yes he did, Jackie.

He just used my body.

She's been getting it a whole
lot better than I have lately.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.975
You don't know what was
going on in Dan's mind.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.278
Maybe Phyllis just made him
feel good about himself.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.780
And the important thing
is he came home to you.

sex with Phyllis, OK?

he did? haven't you

19:58.565 --> 20:00.066
Yeah, I guess.

to go to school first and make
