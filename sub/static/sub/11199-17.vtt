00:01.648 --> 00:05.209
<i>- Previously on Stargate SG-1.
- The Replicators.</i>

00:05.285 --> 00:07.685
They've launched an
all-out attack on the Goa'uld.

00:07.754 --> 00:10.018
<i>If the Goa'uld can't find
a way to stop them...</i>

00:10.090 --> 00:13.958
<i>the Replicators will easily
overrun our galaxy in a matter of weeks.</i>

00:15.362 --> 00:17.193
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

00:17.264 --> 00:20.324
<i>to get what I need, we're going
to have to dig a little deeper.</i>

00:20.400 --> 00:24.632
<i>We must once and for all
destroy the Goa'uld image as gods forever.</i>

00:24.705 --> 00:27.674
- How?
- By capturing the temple at Dakara.

00:27.741 --> 00:29.231
<i>There's a way to defeat the Replicators...</i>

00:29.309 --> 00:31.072
hidden somewhere
within my memories, isn't there?

00:31.144 --> 00:33.237
You need only
to open your mind to it.

00:33.313 --> 00:37.147
<i>A force of rebel Jaffa have managed
to take control of the temple at Dakara.</i>

00:37.217 --> 00:40.345
Have the fleet disengage their
battle with the Replicators.

00:40.420 --> 00:42.911
Take it back at all costs.

00:42.989 --> 00:47.187
The ruins of an Ancient monument
on a planet now called Dakara.

00:47.260 --> 00:51.424
Within it is the one weapon in this galaxy
capable of destroying me.

00:56.002 --> 00:58.903
<i>A device capable of destroying
all life in the galaxy?</i>

00:58.972 --> 01:01.167
That's what he said.

01:02.409 --> 01:04.434
Ba'al said he was serving Anubis?

01:04.511 --> 01:06.376
Not exactly.

01:06.446 --> 01:08.744
You know those Goa'uld
and their egos.

01:08.815 --> 01:11.079
He would never admit
to being subservient.

01:11.151 --> 01:15.417
No. He said he was biding his time,
learning what he could from Anubis.

01:15.489 --> 01:17.616
Probably looking for a way
to kill him.

01:17.691 --> 01:20.057
Well, we have no idea how
this Ancient device works...

01:20.127 --> 01:22.061
or what the effects will be.

01:22.129 --> 01:26.361
But since Anubis has no real corporeal
form, it's likely he would survive it.

01:26.433 --> 01:28.867
- He'd have no one left to rule.
- For now.

01:28.935 --> 01:31.699
I mean, time may not even be
an issue for someone like him.

01:31.772 --> 01:35.640
He could start over, repopulate
the galaxy to his own specifications.

01:35.709 --> 01:38.075
That's a little ambitious.

01:38.145 --> 01:40.705
He has at least some knowledge of
the Ancients. I wouldn't put it past him.

01:41.948 --> 01:46.385
Yeah. Well, let me sit here
and state the obvious.

01:46.453 --> 01:48.819
We can't let something like this
get into his hands.

01:48.889 --> 01:51.119
Or the Replicators' hands,
for that matter.

01:51.191 --> 01:54.649
How much time do we have before
Ba'al's fleet reaches Dakara?

01:54.728 --> 01:56.491
Why?

01:56.563 --> 01:59.430
Ba'al didn't say exactly
where the device was, did he?

01:59.499 --> 02:01.399
No. He said it was hidden.

02:01.468 --> 02:04.733
Well, chances are it's in the ruins,
but we can't be sure.

02:04.805 --> 02:06.739
I mean, short of blowing up
the entire planet...

02:06.807 --> 02:09.037
we can't be 100% positive
we've destroyed it.

02:09.109 --> 02:10.736
And if it's protected
by a shield...

02:10.811 --> 02:14.406
even our biggest naquadah-enhanced nuke
might not do it.

02:14.481 --> 02:18.474
To be sure we've destroyed the weapon,
we have to find it first.

02:19.986 --> 02:20.953
Go.

03:39.032 --> 03:41.330
We've found no evidence
of a weapon.

03:45.005 --> 03:48.168
Thanks, guys.
We'll take it from here.

03:48.241 --> 03:51.904
But this structure was
definitely built by the Ancients.

03:51.978 --> 03:53.912
As evidenced by the script
on this wall.

03:53.980 --> 03:56.813
Until I saw this monument
with my own eyes...

03:56.883 --> 03:59.579
I did not know that Dakara
was a home of the Ancients.

03:59.653 --> 04:01.245
The Ancient
repository of knowledge...

04:01.321 --> 04:05.257
we found on P3X-439 was hidden
in a large monument like this.

04:05.325 --> 04:08.419
Maybe this writing will help us uncover
the location of the weapon.

04:08.495 --> 04:11.225
I was able
to recognize the language.

04:11.298 --> 04:13.289
Deciphering it, however,
is another matter.

04:13.366 --> 04:15.596
I brought Daniel's notebooks.

04:18.872 --> 04:21.432
This dialect looks very old.

04:22.742 --> 04:25.575
- It may take some time.
- I will leave you to it.

04:37.824 --> 04:40.588
We will be vastly outnumbered
by Ba'al's forces.

04:40.660 --> 04:43.493
I refuse to consider
a strategy...

04:43.563 --> 04:47.294
that demands the deliberate
sacrifice of Jaffa lives.

04:47.367 --> 04:49.961
What then do you advocate?
Prayer, perhaps?

04:50.036 --> 04:52.061
Jaffa.

04:52.138 --> 04:54.629
We are here to consider
the battle with our enemy.

04:54.708 --> 04:56.676
Not battle each other.

04:59.813 --> 05:03.340
Ba'al's forces approach at a rate of speed
far slower than they are capable.

05:03.416 --> 05:07.409
Indeed, it seems he does wish to give us
time to find and destroy the weapon.

05:07.487 --> 05:10.081
Why not just destroy it himself?

05:10.156 --> 05:12.351
Ba'al is in a difficult position.

05:12.425 --> 05:15.189
With so many witnesses,
it is far easier to tell Anubis...

05:15.261 --> 05:18.958
that the weapon was destroyed
before he was able to reclaim Dakara.

05:19.032 --> 05:21.091
How then will he explain
his languid pace?

05:21.167 --> 05:24.694
Regardless, he will only
hesitate so long.

05:24.771 --> 05:28.434
Five Ha'tak.
Eight Al'kesh.

05:28.508 --> 05:32.467
Ten squadrons of gliders.
That is all we have.

05:32.545 --> 05:34.513
Empty the bays.

05:34.581 --> 05:38.517
Deploy the gliders to
the far side of the planet.

05:38.585 --> 05:40.052
Take two Ha'tak and all the Al'kesh...

05:40.120 --> 05:42.213
and position them
on the other side of the moon.

05:42.288 --> 05:45.689
- Divide our forces?
- Precisely.

05:47.027 --> 05:50.360
All of our hardship,
the suffering...

05:50.430 --> 05:54.730
the sacrifices we have made
for our cause will end today...

05:54.801 --> 05:57.497
one way or another.

05:57.570 --> 06:01.301
This battle will decide
the fate of all Jaffa.

06:10.283 --> 06:11.875
This is madness.

06:11.951 --> 06:14.647
So too at one time...

06:14.721 --> 06:17.554
was the very thought
of our freedom.

06:25.198 --> 06:27.393
So now what?
We done?

06:27.467 --> 06:29.367
You got what you wanted.

06:29.436 --> 06:32.337
I don't suppose you wanna just
drop me off at the nearest Stargate?

06:34.140 --> 06:37.200
It is true.
I learned the location of the weapon...

06:37.277 --> 06:40.474
that could be a threat
to me and my brethren.

06:40.547 --> 06:44.415
But I also saw the extent of knowledge
your subconscious mind contains.

06:50.190 --> 06:52.249
You have no idea, do you?

06:52.325 --> 06:56.193
No. No, I don't.

06:56.262 --> 07:01.029
You've tried accessing it, but
it's always just out of reach, isn't it?

07:01.835 --> 07:03.894
I could help you.

07:03.970 --> 07:05.961
We could unlock the
knowledge of the Ancients...

07:06.039 --> 07:09.133
the secrets of the universe together.

07:11.311 --> 07:14.109
I have to admit,
it does sound interesting.

07:17.851 --> 07:20.979
On the other hand,
you're an evil killing machine.

07:21.054 --> 07:23.147
So, no. Pass.

07:29.896 --> 07:32.797
No! Don't do this!

07:35.869 --> 07:39.965
You had the power. You were
about to strike, but she stopped you.

07:41.941 --> 07:45.274
No, I don't believe you.
You can make me see whatever you want.

07:45.345 --> 07:48.473
- That's just a trick.
- You know it's true.

07:50.884 --> 07:53.352
Destroying the weapon
that can destroy me is one thing.

07:53.419 --> 07:57.753
A good thing for me,
but there is more.

07:58.825 --> 08:02.591
There is a way to kill Anubis
in your mind...

08:02.662 --> 08:05.153
and so much more.

08:06.232 --> 08:09.395
I am not done, Daniel Jackson.

08:09.469 --> 08:11.801
Far from it.

08:11.871 --> 08:15.466
In fact, we have only just begun.

08:21.714 --> 08:24.808
"Midday, the darkness is high in the sky"?

08:24.884 --> 08:28.718
- You sure about that?
- That is what it says.

08:28.788 --> 08:31.052
It doesn't make much sense.

08:31.124 --> 08:35.891
Yeah, well, neither does,
"The wind blows on the pillow."

08:35.962 --> 08:40.456
Or, "Three days to the chicken."

08:40.533 --> 08:43.195
But that's what these phrases
apparently translate into.

08:44.571 --> 08:47.199
Are you saying this whole wall
of writing is nonsense?

08:47.273 --> 08:49.036
I don't know what I'm saying.

08:49.108 --> 08:51.235
Is it possible you made a mistake?

08:51.311 --> 08:52.972
Would you care to try?

08:57.217 --> 08:59.151
The text is quite difficult...

08:59.219 --> 09:01.483
and if there is an organizing principle
to Dr. Jackson's notes...

09:01.554 --> 09:04.045
I have yet to discover it.

09:04.123 --> 09:07.217
Yeah. He certainly has his own system.

09:07.293 --> 09:10.319
<i>- Colonel Carter.
- Go ahead, Teal'c.</i>

09:10.396 --> 09:12.728
Have you had any success
with the translation?

09:14.400 --> 09:17.858
We're making some progress.

09:17.937 --> 09:21.395
I am afraid you do not have
much more time.

09:21.474 --> 09:24.841
Our long-range scanners
have detected Ba'al's fleet.

09:24.911 --> 09:27.038
He will be here within the hour.

09:28.414 --> 09:29.438
Understood.

09:35.889 --> 09:38.915
It would be much easier
on both of us if you did not resist.

09:39.792 --> 09:41.851
Why, why, why?

09:41.928 --> 09:45.694
Why in the whole wide world of all things
rational and sane would I help you?

09:45.765 --> 09:48.962
Because deep down,
you also want the knowledge I seek.

09:49.035 --> 09:52.129
But the problem is, anything I learn
I won't be able to put to much use...

09:52.205 --> 09:54.605
because right after I'm done,
you're going to kill me.

09:54.674 --> 09:56.608
What if I promised not to?

09:56.676 --> 09:58.337
Yeah.

09:59.445 --> 10:02.141
Do you really think I am that different
from Samantha Carter?

10:02.215 --> 10:05.742
In that you're a Replicator
bent on galactic domination...

10:05.818 --> 10:08.912
at the expense of
all other living things-

10:08.988 --> 10:12.287
Her thoughts, her memories,
even her emotions-

10:12.358 --> 10:14.155
they are not meaningless to me.

10:16.329 --> 10:20.095
I do not wish to harm you
or destroy Earth for that matter.

10:20.166 --> 10:23.465
I could have done that
already if I so desired.

10:24.470 --> 10:26.768
You're saying
you'll leave Earth untouched?

10:27.640 --> 10:31.406
I promise you that, and your life.

10:35.882 --> 10:38.350
Nope.
Nope, not gonna help you.

10:38.418 --> 10:41.410
But obviously,
I can't do anything to stop you.

10:41.487 --> 10:44.513
So give it your best shot.

10:49.696 --> 10:51.687
What if it's a code?

10:53.366 --> 10:55.459
Something that can
only be deciphered...

10:55.535 --> 10:57.799
by someone who understands
the language.

11:01.107 --> 11:03.507
Can I see that?

11:05.178 --> 11:08.204
- You're holding it upside down.
- I know. I just noticed.

11:08.281 --> 11:12.513
Upside down, these symbols
look like another word I've seen before.

11:14.921 --> 11:17.355
Right-side up, it's "darkness."

11:17.423 --> 11:20.517
Turn it around and...

11:20.593 --> 11:22.891
it translates into "sun."

11:23.730 --> 11:26.961
"Midday, the sun is high in the sky."
That makes a lot more sense.

11:27.033 --> 11:30.127
Yeah. But so what?

11:30.203 --> 11:33.070
That's not what the wall says.

12:09.442 --> 12:10.909
Now it does.

12:10.977 --> 12:13.741
It can't be that simple.

12:13.813 --> 12:15.940
Just turn all five circles
upside down?

12:16.015 --> 12:20.816
No, I agree. It has to be
some sort of combination lock.

12:20.887 --> 12:23.515
We just need to figure out
which circles to turn.

12:27.193 --> 12:30.890
<i>Your pathetic trickery
will only delay your inevitable defeat.</i>

12:30.963 --> 12:33.898
There is no trickery at hand.

12:33.966 --> 12:38.494
We know that, inevitably,
your goal is to eradicate all free Jaffa.

12:38.571 --> 12:42.200
We have sent the bulk of our fleet
to safety to survive to fight another day.

12:42.275 --> 12:45.301
<i>Surrender now, or be destroyed.</i>

12:45.378 --> 12:47.539
Defeat those who remain,
and you'll be forced...

12:47.613 --> 12:50.639
to destroy the weapon
on Dakara yourself.

12:50.716 --> 12:52.411
Then you must face Anubis.

12:55.521 --> 12:58.513
His fleet appears
to be holding position.

12:59.892 --> 13:02.224
For the moment.

13:12.505 --> 13:14.769
Let's hope that's not a bad sign.

13:14.841 --> 13:16.502
Let's go!

13:39.765 --> 13:41.790
Nice goin', Sam.

14:03.322 --> 14:04.812
We're in business.

14:10.062 --> 14:12.553
<i>It's definitely of Ancient design, sir.</i>

14:12.632 --> 14:14.566
Think our bomb will do the trick?

14:14.634 --> 14:16.829
<i>We'll soon see.
Give us 10 minutes.</i>

14:16.903 --> 14:19.337
<i>- Carter out.
- Right.</i>

14:45.164 --> 14:47.689
You might wanna
hold off on that for a minute.

14:51.237 --> 14:53.205
If I'm reading this screen right...

14:55.041 --> 14:56.599
the weapon uses an energy wave...

14:56.676 --> 15:00.874
to reduce all matter
to its basic molecular elements.

15:00.947 --> 15:05.543
It's not strong enough to
disintegrate an entire planet...

15:05.618 --> 15:08.018
but it will wash away everything
on a planet's surface...

15:08.087 --> 15:10.180
and anything in
the surrounding space.

15:10.256 --> 15:12.247
That sounds bad.

15:12.325 --> 15:15.852
I know, but it also sounds like
it does it much the same way...

15:15.928 --> 15:18.897
your disrupter technology
works on the Replicators-

15:18.965 --> 15:22.526
by separating
the individual components.

15:22.602 --> 15:24.570
They are both Ancient design.

15:24.637 --> 15:27.731
And General O'Neill did use
Ancient knowledge to build the disrupter.

15:27.807 --> 15:29.138
I know.

15:30.209 --> 15:33.576
Do you think this weapon can be
modified to work only on the Replicators?

15:33.646 --> 15:36.410
I don't know.
But I'd hate to blow it up...

15:36.482 --> 15:39.246
before I was 100% sure it couldn't.

15:41.687 --> 15:45.214
<i>- Teal'c, do you read?
- Proceed, Colonel Carter.</i>

15:45.291 --> 15:50.126
Look, my dad and Selmak
think this weapon may hold the key...

15:50.196 --> 15:52.596
to defeating the Replicators,
and we'll need some time to find out.

15:52.665 --> 15:55.964
Just let us know when things get bad,
and we'll blow it and get out.

15:56.035 --> 15:59.766
<i>- Understood.
- Carter out.</i>

16:02.675 --> 16:05.803
Ba'al's fleet just began
moving into attack position.

16:07.246 --> 16:10.079
It appears things
are about to get...

16:10.149 --> 16:11.810
bad.

16:16.722 --> 16:18.849
I'm not getting anything.

16:21.661 --> 16:23.686
This may not be possible, you know.

16:23.763 --> 16:27.699
Come on, Sam. It can't be any harder
than blowing up a sun.

16:27.767 --> 16:31.760
You blow up one sun, and suddenly
everyone expects you to walk on water.

16:36.509 --> 16:39.000
There you go.

16:39.078 --> 16:42.479
Well, next up:
Parting the Red Sea.

16:53.959 --> 16:55.950
Shields are down 50%.

16:57.730 --> 16:59.789
We cannot take much more.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.127
Signal the other Ha'tak.

17:03.202 --> 17:07.366
Begin retreating,
sub-light engines only, full power.

17:13.813 --> 17:17.749
The rebels are fleeing, my lord.
The planet is ours.

17:17.817 --> 17:22.686
They expect us to follow so that they may
draw the fleet into battle on two fronts.

17:23.556 --> 17:26.821
<i>- Signal the fleet to pursue the shol'va.
- My lord?</i>

17:26.892 --> 17:29.087
Dakara can wait.

17:29.161 --> 17:31.095
No battle strategy
can save them now.

17:31.163 --> 17:35.224
We will crush them
and then take the temple.

17:35.301 --> 17:37.895
Yes, my lord.

17:37.970 --> 17:41.030
I'm pretty sure this output
is giving us the frequency spectrum...

17:41.107 --> 17:44.076
of the wave the weapon uses
to disintegrate matter.

17:44.143 --> 17:47.203
It's nothing like the spectrum analysis
of the Replicator disrupter wave.

17:47.279 --> 17:49.839
- Here, look.
- Yeah, I know.

17:49.915 --> 17:52.713
But all we have to do is alter
the settings on the weapon console...

17:52.785 --> 17:55.618
so that the output wave matches that
of the disrupter technology.

17:57.423 --> 17:59.050
All we have to do?

17:59.125 --> 18:02.891
The device can be set by varying
the height of these panels.

18:12.304 --> 18:15.603
I can run a program to compare
the difference between the two waves.

18:15.674 --> 18:17.608
It should let us know if we're
going in the right direction.

18:17.676 --> 18:19.974
That's good.

18:20.045 --> 18:21.876
You know, even if
we can make this work...

18:21.947 --> 18:24.939
the Replicators were quickly able to adapt
themselves to the frequency modulation...

18:25.017 --> 18:26.951
Thor made to
the original disrupter wave.

18:27.019 --> 18:29.146
What are you saying?

18:29.221 --> 18:31.416
We realized the only way
to eliminate the Replicators...

18:31.490 --> 18:33.424
and not allow them time
to develop an immunity...

18:33.492 --> 18:35.790
was to somehow hit them all
at the same time.

18:35.861 --> 18:39.627
Everywhere in the galaxy?
How are we supposed to do that?

18:39.698 --> 18:42.098
The weapon translates
through the Stargate.

18:42.168 --> 18:45.729
Do you think Anubis was planning to use
the weapon to attack one planet at a time?

18:45.805 --> 18:48.467
So dial multiple gates simultaneously?

18:48.541 --> 18:51.101
Not multiple gates.
All of them.

18:52.244 --> 18:55.304
Every Stargate in the galaxy
at one time?

18:55.381 --> 18:59.408
Do you know how many gates
there are in the whole galaxy?

18:59.485 --> 19:00.816
A lot.

19:04.957 --> 19:07.790
I have no idea
how to alter a Stargate...

19:07.860 --> 19:10.454
to perform such a function.

19:10.529 --> 19:13.555
I don't know
of anyone who can.

19:13.632 --> 19:15.793
I think I know someone.

19:17.236 --> 19:21.002
<i>- Are you certain, Colonel Carter?
- I don't think we have a choice, Teal'c.</i>

19:21.073 --> 19:23.007
<i>I mean, this could be
the best chance we'll ever get.</i>

19:27.980 --> 19:29.641
Understood.

19:31.550 --> 19:33.484
Opening a channel.

19:36.055 --> 19:38.387
<i>No doubt you have decided
to surrender.</i>

19:38.457 --> 19:40.948
<i>A wise decision, given that
you face imminent defeat.</i>

19:41.026 --> 19:43.119
We have no intention
of surrendering.

19:43.195 --> 19:47.689
I merely wish to inform you that we
have found the Ancient weapon on Dakara.

19:48.767 --> 19:50.735
<i>Do you intend to destroy it?</i>

19:50.803 --> 19:53.499
That would be foolish.

19:53.572 --> 19:55.506
We have learned that
the Ancient weapon...

19:55.574 --> 19:59.010
may be the means to destroy
the Replicators once and for all.

20:09.121 --> 20:12.852
It's incredible.
Yet you still resist me.

20:12.925 --> 20:16.053
Do you not care?
Are you not amazed by what you are seeing?

20:16.128 --> 20:18.358
I don't understand it.

20:18.430 --> 20:21.092
It's more than any human
can begin to comprehend.

20:21.166 --> 20:24.499
- I am not human.
- Believe me, I know.

20:24.570 --> 20:27.061
There must be a limit to
how much your mind can process...

20:27.139 --> 20:29.073
how much information
you can store.

20:29.141 --> 20:31.609
I am sharing what I learn
with my brethren.

20:32.578 --> 20:37.174
The extent of knowledge we can absorb
is only limited by our numbers.

20:37.249 --> 20:41.709
As we speak, those numbers
are growing faster than you can imagine.

20:52.898 --> 20:55.867
This chamber
must be well-shielded.

20:55.935 --> 20:57.903
I could not find it
using my ship's sensors.

20:57.970 --> 21:00.734
Look, I assume
Teal'c told you the plan.

21:01.807 --> 21:05.800
What makes you think you can modify
this weapon to defeat Replicators?

21:05.878 --> 21:08.779
We're already on our way
to doing that.

21:08.847 --> 21:11.839
We need to get
this weapon's wave output...

21:11.917 --> 21:17.014
to match our modified Replicator
disrupter wave to within a margin of.76%.

21:17.089 --> 21:20.889
How did you develop this Replicator
disrupter technology in the first place?

21:20.960 --> 21:25.556
General O'Neill built it using
Ancient knowledge and an Asgard computer.

21:25.631 --> 21:29.795
O'Neill? The mere thought of that
makes me sick.

21:32.171 --> 21:34.503
Look, if we can do this...

21:34.573 --> 21:37.542
and somehow hit the Replicators
all at the same time...

21:37.610 --> 21:39.942
we think it will work,
but we need your help.

21:40.779 --> 21:43.304
You want me to reprogram
a Stargate...

21:43.382 --> 21:45.942
to dial every gate
in the galaxy simultaneously?

21:46.018 --> 21:48.282
I know you used the gate's
automatic update program...

21:48.354 --> 21:51.653
to disseminate a dialing program virus
to the entire gate network.

21:51.724 --> 21:54.818
With a virus you initially
planted in my Stargate.

21:56.629 --> 22:01.259
No one's trying to deny that we're mortal
enemies here. Can you do it or not?

22:02.368 --> 22:05.667
I cannot believe
I am even considering cooperating...

22:05.738 --> 22:09.367
with a female of the Tauri
and a Tok'ra.

22:09.441 --> 22:13.036
This was not my idea,
believe me.

22:14.813 --> 22:17.543
- I'll instruct my troops to land.
- No way.

22:17.616 --> 22:20.312
You send one Jaffa down here,
and the deal's off.

22:20.386 --> 22:23.355
I cannot do what you ask
by means of a hologram transmission.

22:23.422 --> 22:26.391
Sure you can.
Just tell me what to do.

22:29.261 --> 22:32.230
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

22:32.297 --> 22:35.323
- Is that Carter?
- No. We are picking up a radio signal.

22:35.401 --> 22:37.460
Put it on speaker.

22:41.273 --> 22:43.605
- Sergeant?
- I don't know, sir.

22:47.246 --> 22:50.613
- What the hell is that?
- I'm not sure, sir.

22:50.683 --> 22:55.586
I can't access the system. Somebody's
hacked into the computer remotely.

22:55.654 --> 22:57.815
- Shut it down.
- I can't, sir. I'm locked out.

22:59.725 --> 23:01.317
Damn!

23:02.795 --> 23:04.387
This is General O'Neill.

23:06.331 --> 23:08.856
Sir!

23:20.312 --> 23:23.543
Evacuate the gate room!
Get out of there!

23:30.489 --> 23:32.184
Close the blast doors.

23:39.298 --> 23:42.028
Initiate base lockdown.

23:42.101 --> 23:45.468
Emergency evacuation of all personnel
through alternate routes.

23:45.537 --> 23:48.995
Self-destruct protocol on my order.

23:49.074 --> 23:51.201
Let's go, Walter.
Get out of here.

24:05.324 --> 24:08.088
- Oh, man.
- Sir.

24:09.027 --> 24:11.655
We're cut off from the self-destruct.
They were too fast.

24:11.730 --> 24:14.221
Even if we can fight through them now,
there's a good chance...

24:14.299 --> 24:16.426
they've already disabled
the activation mechanism.

24:16.502 --> 24:19.665
Those bugs cannot
get out of this mountain.

24:19.738 --> 24:22.138
It's only a matter of time before
they gain control of the base systems...

24:22.207 --> 24:24.141
and override the security doors.

24:24.209 --> 24:28.168
Let's make sure everybody's out of here.
Then we'll toss a nuke down the silo.

24:28.247 --> 24:31.774
- You think that'll stop 'em?
- It should slow 'em down.

24:38.991 --> 24:41.983
You can't handle it, can you?

24:42.060 --> 24:45.257
I can.
I just need time to process...

24:45.330 --> 24:47.628
share it with the others.

24:47.699 --> 24:50.327
Like the universe, it's infinite.

24:50.402 --> 24:52.336
It's not just
knowledge and information.

24:52.404 --> 24:54.463
It's understanding on a level
that you will never reach.

24:54.540 --> 24:56.667
Why do you think that?

24:56.742 --> 24:58.710
Because you're a machine.

24:58.777 --> 25:02.144
So are you,
just of weaker construction.

25:02.214 --> 25:04.307
And that's where you're wrong.

25:05.784 --> 25:07.046
We'll see.

25:10.122 --> 25:12.647
<i>General Hammond says
the president has authorized deployment...</i>

25:12.724 --> 25:15.625
<i>of a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb
on your command, sir.</i>

25:15.694 --> 25:18.959
<i>An emergency state of alert has been
issued, and a 200-square-mile radius...</i>

25:19.031 --> 25:21.898
<i>around Cheyenne Mountain
is currently being evacuated.</i>

25:21.967 --> 25:23.867
<i>A transport helicopter
is waiting on the surface...</i>

25:23.936 --> 25:26.427
<i>for you and the remaining personnel.</i>

25:27.606 --> 25:29.198
Thank you, Walter.

25:31.310 --> 25:33.642
- Colonel.
- We have a problem, sir.

25:33.712 --> 25:36.146
Six SGC personnel
are trapped on Level 8.

25:36.215 --> 25:38.376
They're cut off from
the emergency escape hatch.

25:45.257 --> 25:47.555
Let's go.

25:53.665 --> 25:55.656
You lied to me.

25:55.734 --> 25:58.532
- What?
- You promised you'd leave Earth alone.

25:58.604 --> 26:01.038
There's Replicators
infiltrating the SGC right now.

26:01.106 --> 26:03.267
How can you know that?

26:06.879 --> 26:09.370
While I was in your mind,
you were inside mine.

26:09.448 --> 26:12.849
Took a while to figure out. Fortunately,
you were too distracted to notice.

26:12.918 --> 26:14.852
Some of the Ancient knowledge
really helped too.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.683
- Thank you.
- You tricked me.

26:16.755 --> 26:19.019
You tricked me first.

26:19.091 --> 26:21.389
- You should never have told me.
- Too late.

26:21.460 --> 26:23.394
For you, that is.

26:26.465 --> 26:30.367
Trying to leave? Sorry.
A little more time in Danny's world.

26:30.435 --> 26:33.029
My brethren will not stop.

26:33.105 --> 26:35.039
You cannot control them.

26:35.107 --> 26:38.270
Not yet, but I'm learning.

26:50.322 --> 26:53.917
We rigged the DHD to dial automatically
on signal when the weapon's ready.

26:53.992 --> 26:57.621
- I think it should work.
- Of course it will work.

26:57.696 --> 26:59.391
How dare you doubt me?

27:01.066 --> 27:04.729
- What's he still doing here?
- I can't exactly ask him to leave.

27:04.803 --> 27:08.432
- How's it going on your end?
- I'm getting closer.

27:08.507 --> 27:10.737
This one.

27:12.811 --> 27:14.972
How do you know?

27:15.047 --> 27:17.914
I'm a god.
Gods are all-knowing.

27:20.652 --> 27:22.916
Selmak can't work like this.

27:22.988 --> 27:24.979
Neither can I.

27:25.057 --> 27:27.855
Just try it.

27:44.643 --> 27:45.940
Lucky guess.

28:06.431 --> 28:10.026
<i>- Siler, are you in there?
- Yes, sir.</i>

28:10.102 --> 28:12.332
We're gonna get you out.
Step away from the blast door.

28:12.404 --> 28:16.363
Yes, sir!
Let's get this table over!

28:21.546 --> 28:23.571
Use two of those things.

28:23.648 --> 28:25.138
Sir?

28:25.217 --> 28:28.152
It's a "blast door."

28:38.397 --> 28:40.058
Hang on, Siler.

28:45.771 --> 28:47.329
Fire in the hole.

28:47.406 --> 28:48.668
Down!

29:05.023 --> 29:06.615
Thank you, sir.

29:06.691 --> 29:10.354
- I expect to be put in your will.
- Already in it, sir.

29:10.429 --> 29:12.727
Okay, that's weird.

29:24.009 --> 29:26.239
Crap.

29:41.927 --> 29:45.226
Sensors are picking up
multiple ships exiting hyperspace.

29:54.906 --> 29:56.931
They are firing on Ba'al's forces.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.148
It is the Replicators.

30:05.450 --> 30:06.815
Now this one.

30:15.427 --> 30:17.861
That one took us
in the wrong direction.

30:17.929 --> 30:19.294
All-knowing, huh?

30:22.167 --> 30:25.466
- What's the matter?
- My ships are under attack.

30:25.537 --> 30:28.597
A massive Replicator-controlled fleet
is encroaching on the planet.

30:40.252 --> 30:43.585
- We're running low on ammo, sir!
- Fall back!

30:51.396 --> 30:55.332
Instruct all of our vessels
to target the Replicator ships.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.459
Are we not better off
letting them destroy each other?

30:57.536 --> 31:01.632
If the Replicators should prevail and
gain control of the weapon on Dakara...

31:01.706 --> 31:03.833
all that we have fought for is lost.

31:08.313 --> 31:12.113
<i>General, 15 minutes
to safe detonation conditions.</i>

31:12.184 --> 31:14.584
Yeah, you know, Walter?
Right now...

31:14.653 --> 31:18.248
we're having a slightly difficult time
getting out of here.

31:18.323 --> 31:21.224
Relay this to General Hammond.

31:21.293 --> 31:24.592
The second he can pull the trigger
on that nuke, do it.

31:24.663 --> 31:27.393
<i>- Do you read?
- Yes, sir.</i>

31:27.465 --> 31:30.593
And have that chopper
that's waiting for us leave now.

31:30.669 --> 31:33.331
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Sir?</i>

31:35.340 --> 31:38.468
You see those bugs
go into that hatch?

31:38.543 --> 31:41.910
Yes, sir. Think getting out of the base
is their primary goal?

31:41.980 --> 31:45.507
It's a fairly safe bet.
They're going to the surface.

31:45.584 --> 31:48.451
Leaving the only other way
out of here accessible.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.385
And here.

31:57.162 --> 31:58.720
<i>1.3 2.
We're almost there.</i>

32:01.800 --> 32:04.826
My ship has lost life support
on several levels.

32:04.903 --> 32:07.098
Our shield strength is failing.
I cannot maintain my transmission.

32:07.172 --> 32:11.074
We've almost got it.
Thanks for the help.

32:11.142 --> 32:12.541
Good luck.

32:14.379 --> 32:18.042
- That was just creepy.
- Keep working.

32:53.885 --> 32:55.944
Go!

33:13.104 --> 33:16.801
- Siler, can we dial out?
- I'm working on it, sir.

33:18.276 --> 33:20.039
Ten minutes to detonation.

33:29.487 --> 33:32.650
Shields down!
Weapons systems off-line!

33:32.724 --> 33:34.954
Reroute power to sub-light engines.

33:35.026 --> 33:37.324
Evasive maneuvers.

33:42.434 --> 33:45.961
They are too fast.
We cannot evade them.

33:59.317 --> 34:01.581
- How's it going in there?
- Not well.

34:01.653 --> 34:02.984
Same here.

34:05.457 --> 34:07.982
Grenade!

34:29.414 --> 34:30.938
Variable off by.98.

34:33.585 --> 34:36.418
- What's that?
- Hurry.

34:36.488 --> 34:38.353
I've almost got it.
Just a little more time.

34:38.423 --> 34:41.017
I don't think we have it.

35:02.480 --> 35:05.415
Sorry, sir, I'm trying.

35:13.158 --> 35:15.092
Got you now.

35:26.070 --> 35:27.799
That's odd.

35:31.075 --> 35:34.602
The Replicator ship
just stopped.

35:35.613 --> 35:37.672
Sensors are indicating that
all of the Replicator ships...

35:37.749 --> 35:40.582
have ceased activity.

35:44.889 --> 35:48.950
Colonel Carter, have you successfully
activated the weapon?

35:52.797 --> 35:55.459
Not yet,
but the Replicators down here just froze.

35:57.268 --> 36:00.135
- Dad?
- Almost there!

36:05.477 --> 36:07.445
There are so many, aren't there?

36:07.512 --> 36:10.481
Too many
for your mind to handle.

36:10.548 --> 36:14.484
It's taking all of your concentration
just to control them.

36:49.053 --> 36:52.489
Well, that was
too good to last.

36:58.763 --> 37:00.663
Dad, they're on the move again!

37:03.101 --> 37:05.729
- .76!
- Do it!

37:44.676 --> 37:46.644
Incoming wormhole?

38:04.762 --> 38:08.391
Enemy ship is in range.
It is powering weapons.

38:08.466 --> 38:10.730
We cannot survive another hit.

39:30.948 --> 39:34.679
- Dad.
- I'm all right.

39:34.752 --> 39:37.516
- What happened?
- I don't know.

39:38.790 --> 39:40.087
You did it.

39:40.158 --> 39:43.025
Well, Selmak deserves
a little credit.

39:44.262 --> 39:47.754
Okay, most of it.

39:52.470 --> 39:55.769
All Replicator-controlled ships
are dormant.

39:55.840 --> 40:00.140
Prepare enough squads to board them
and reclaim them in the name of their god.

40:00.211 --> 40:01.838
Yes, my lord.

40:01.913 --> 40:04.074
We are being hailed.

40:04.148 --> 40:06.116
On screen.

40:06.184 --> 40:09.278
<i>Surrender now,
and you will be granted mercy.</i>

40:10.888 --> 40:15.222
You are hardly in any position
to be making such ridiculous demands.

40:15.293 --> 40:18.353
<i>- You are surrounded.
- You are incorrect.</i>

40:18.429 --> 40:21.865
<i>It is, in fact, you
that is surrounded by free Jaffa.</i>

40:32.376 --> 40:35.209
Behold your false god.

41:01.105 --> 41:03.630
- Any more word from Teal'c?
- Yes, sir.

41:03.708 --> 41:06.108
Although Ba'al got away,
the fact that he turned tail and ran...

41:06.177 --> 41:08.407
made the rebel victory
every bit the turning point...

41:08.479 --> 41:10.413
Teal'c and Bra'tac were hoping for.

41:10.481 --> 41:13.109
Jaffa from all over the galaxy
are joining with them.

41:13.184 --> 41:16.153
<i>Well, viva la revolution.</i>

41:16.220 --> 41:18.916
They've got a significant-sized fleet
securing Dakara.

41:18.990 --> 41:20.924
Hopefully, with the weapons
we've provided...

41:20.992 --> 41:24.257
they'll be able to turn the tide
against Anubis's Super Soldiers.

41:24.328 --> 41:29.129
It looks like the Jaffa
might finally win their freedom.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.498
- It's about time.
- Yes, sir.

41:31.569 --> 41:34.037
- I heard from Thor.
- How's he doing?

41:34.105 --> 41:36.596
Great. He sends us all
his congratulations...

41:36.674 --> 41:38.835
and says that
he will drop by for a visit...

41:38.910 --> 41:40.878
as soon as his consciousness
has been downloaded...

41:40.945 --> 41:44.108
from the ship's computer
into a new body.

41:44.182 --> 41:47.709
- That just never gets old, does it?
- Apparently not.

41:51.022 --> 41:53.388
Carter, did you notice...

41:53.457 --> 41:57.018
if the Replicators where you were
happened to...

41:57.094 --> 41:59.324
stop in the middle of everything?

41:59.397 --> 42:01.228
Yeah, it was really strange.
They just...

42:01.299 --> 42:02.732
froze.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.826
It actually bought us the time
we needed to calibrate the weapon.

42:05.903 --> 42:08.064
Any idea why that happened?

42:09.907 --> 42:11.841
You think Daniel
had something to do with it?

42:11.909 --> 42:13.843
I don't know.

42:13.911 --> 42:17.312
Sir, if he was on board
that Replicator ship when-

42:17.381 --> 42:19.372
We don't know anything.

42:21.252 --> 42:22.913
No, sir.

42:24.088 --> 42:26.249
Anything else?

42:27.558 --> 42:28.820
No, sir.
