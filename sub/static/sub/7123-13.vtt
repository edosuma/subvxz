00:37.070 --> 00:38.059
Finn to Prubs.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.833
Come in, Prubs.

00:39.906 --> 00:40.736
Hey, Finn!

00:40.807 --> 00:41.899
How's the mission going?

00:41.975 --> 00:44.375
So far, no sign of the Birdman.

00:44.444 --> 00:46.002
Why's this guy
so dangerous?

00:46.079 --> 00:48.912
Some say he's a half
man/half bird that poops

00:48.982 --> 00:50.745
fire while he flies.

00:50.817 --> 00:52.648
It's all rumors so far.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.187
That's why I need you and Jake
to find out everything you can

00:55.255 --> 00:57.314
about him and
report back to me.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.482
Where are you?

00:58.558 --> 00:59.650
Under the sea.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.694
The mermaids are
trying to beach themselves.

01:01.761 --> 01:03.353
I came to see why.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.159
Turns out,
they're just lonely.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.493
Ha ha!

01:06.566 --> 01:08.363
Maybe I'll go hang out
with them after this biz.

01:08.435 --> 01:09.868
Sounds great, Finn.

01:09.936 --> 01:11.699
Okay. Bye, PB!

01:11.771 --> 01:13.466
By-y-y-y-y-e!

01:13.540 --> 01:15.974
Come on, let's go
look for that creep.

01:32.725 --> 01:34.022
Whoa.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.067
Huh? Where am I?

01:46.139 --> 01:50.235
This is the Rookery, where I
and my bird friends dwell.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.868
So are you, like,
the great birdman?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.913
That's what they
call me nowadays.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.470
But when I first met you, Finn,

01:55.548 --> 01:59.848
and you, Jake, you knew me as
Xergiok, the Goblin King!

01:59.919 --> 02:01.318
Wha-a-a?!

02:01.387 --> 02:05.153
When we first met, I was crazy
for smacking goblin hams.

02:05.225 --> 02:08.058
I was cruel,
selfish, brutal.

02:08.127 --> 02:12.087
But everything changed after I
was defeated by the two of you!

02:12.165 --> 02:14.224
So, you got some
slick new shades,

02:14.300 --> 02:15.961
and now everything's
different?

02:16.035 --> 02:18.003
Oh, no.
My change has been deep.

02:18.071 --> 02:21.336
And these whatsits are only
curtains for empty windows.

02:23.276 --> 02:24.106
Whoa.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.303
What happened there?

02:25.378 --> 02:27.778
I miffed off a wizard,
and he took my eyes.

02:28.781 --> 02:30.681
I wonder what he
wanted them for...

02:30.750 --> 02:34.413
some kind of lotion or potion
or time-traveling spell.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.681
I'll never know.

02:35.755 --> 02:38.883
Never. Ever. Never.

02:38.958 --> 02:40.448
But losing my
eyesight was only

02:40.527 --> 02:42.757
the beginning of
my wonderful change.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.024
I started meditating
and doing yoga.

02:45.098 --> 02:49.091
Now I can "see" with my
heart and smell with my soul.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.727
You smell
with your beard?

02:50.803 --> 02:52.532
I smell with my nose!

02:52.605 --> 02:53.936
Lame!

02:55.508 --> 02:58.136
Ohmmmmmmmm...

02:58.211 --> 02:59.769
What are you doing?

02:59.846 --> 03:01.939
...mmmmmmm...

03:09.856 --> 03:11.118
Oh, Taffy!

03:11.191 --> 03:12.556
You heard my call!

03:12.625 --> 03:14.092
Climb aboard, boys.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.821
Taffy will take us
to the lower level,

03:15.895 --> 03:17.055
and you can have
a bite to eat.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.253
Oh.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.493
Uh... me and Jake
will follow you.

03:21.568 --> 03:24.036
Jake needs to
stretch out and stuff.

03:24.103 --> 03:25.297
Okay, great!

03:25.371 --> 03:26.463
Well, follow me!

03:32.212 --> 03:33.440
It's crazy, right?

03:33.513 --> 03:35.105
The way dude's eyeballs
are just hanging there?

03:35.181 --> 03:36.478
I know.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.449
I almost told him
'cause it was driving me nuts.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.110
Yeah! Me too!

03:40.186 --> 03:42.780
You think he's got evil
intentions behind his reborn

03:42.855 --> 03:44.186
star-child act?

03:44.257 --> 03:45.417
I don't know.

03:45.491 --> 03:47.652
But if he does,
I'm gonna find out.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.490
Yeah. Me too.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.697
Nice and cool down here,
isn't it?

03:56.836 --> 03:59.066
Aha! Listen to the babies.

03:59.138 --> 04:00.400
Num-num time.

04:02.675 --> 04:04.643
Aw. Hey, that's cute.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.611
There you go, little ones.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.340
Suckle, suckle!

04:09.816 --> 04:12.751
They're small, but they sure
can take a lot out of you.

04:12.819 --> 04:14.753
Whoo! Dizzy.

04:14.821 --> 04:17.084
Sometimes feeding
really wipes me out.

04:17.156 --> 04:20.182
I hope you'll excuse me
while I refocus my Chi.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.321
See you in a while.

04:23.396 --> 04:25.921
Now's our chance to
do some snooping.

04:29.836 --> 04:30.996
Jake!

04:33.406 --> 04:34.873
I found his weapon stash.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.135
Hmm.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.540
What is it?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.237
A fighting stick?
A dagger?

04:40.613 --> 04:42.410
This one's a letter
from the hospital.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.450
You can read those
bumps with your fingers?

04:44.517 --> 04:46.485
Yeah, I learned
braille from my ex.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.110
Your ex was blind?

04:48.187 --> 04:49.381
Nah, just cool.

04:50.590 --> 04:53.923
"Dear Xergiok, thank you
so much for your donation.

04:53.993 --> 04:56.223
The kidneys fit great."

04:56.296 --> 04:59.060
Well, geez, maybe he
<i>has</i> changed his ways.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.121
Maybe.

05:00.199 --> 05:02.099
Let's keep looking.

05:06.773 --> 05:07.671
Doi!

05:11.978 --> 05:13.468
Oh!

05:15.548 --> 05:16.776
Oh, crease!

05:16.849 --> 05:18.248
Psychic links!

05:18.318 --> 05:20.081
Cardamon, my friend,
I'm coming!

05:21.621 --> 05:22.815
Ooh! Aah!

05:22.889 --> 05:23.856
Mother of gob!

05:23.923 --> 05:25.481
Hold on, Cardi!

05:25.558 --> 05:27.549
Okay, here I am, buddy.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.094
OI' Xergi's here.

05:30.563 --> 05:31.825
Let's see, now.

05:31.898 --> 05:32.887
Aw, dang!

05:33.933 --> 05:36.493
Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ng!

05:36.569 --> 05:38.833
Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ng!

05:38.905 --> 05:41.237
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wong!

05:41.307 --> 05:43.036
Wha-a-a-a-t?!

05:43.109 --> 05:44.201
Shush, Chile!

05:44.277 --> 05:46.404
Ah, Finn and Jake,
you are here.

05:46.479 --> 05:48.106
Where'd you learn
that heal spell?

05:48.181 --> 05:50.012
I use no magic.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.677
I manipulated space
with a vibrational chant.

05:52.752 --> 05:55.949
You see, now the injury
has transferred to me.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.751
Ooh, yeah!
That hurts, baby!

05:57.824 --> 05:59.291
Whooooo!

05:59.359 --> 06:00.792
Can't you see,
Jake?

06:00.860 --> 06:03.590
I love these birds
more than I love myself.

06:03.663 --> 06:07.064
What am I to the deafening
roar of the macrocosmos?

06:07.133 --> 06:08.691
Nothing much.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.793
Just a vessel to carry the
message of friendship

06:10.870 --> 06:12.929
to y'all
beasts and dirt.

06:13.005 --> 06:13.972
Dirt?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.132
Yeah. Look.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.676
Hello, friends. Go for a ride.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.507
Listen, man,
about your eyes...

06:19.579 --> 06:21.945
Yes...
a wizard stole them.

06:22.014 --> 06:23.675
All right.
But not...

06:24.984 --> 06:26.474
Finn, what are
you doing, man?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.019
Dude, he's changed.

06:28.087 --> 06:29.418
Are you sure?

06:29.489 --> 06:30.683
Uh, yeah, man.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.224
Isn't it kind of obvi?

06:32.291 --> 06:34.020
All right. Tell him.

06:34.093 --> 06:35.219
Tell me what?

06:35.294 --> 06:36.955
Your eyes weren't
stolen by a wizard.

06:37.029 --> 06:38.223
They're in your beard.

06:38.297 --> 06:39.559
All right.

06:39.632 --> 06:40.997
Ooh! Where are they?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.898
Ohhh! Ohhhhh!

06:42.969 --> 06:45.130
Dude, your eyes
are in your beard.

06:45.204 --> 06:46.364
What?

06:46.439 --> 06:47.565
Good job, guys.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.505
Goofing on the blind guy...
real nice!

06:49.575 --> 06:51.634
No, man, they're right here.

06:51.711 --> 06:54.976
What in my li-i-i-fe?!

06:55.047 --> 06:56.878
We didn't tell you 'cause we
thought you might still

06:56.949 --> 06:58.211
be a Wong Lord.

06:58.284 --> 06:59.945
And these aren't
grapes, right?

07:00.019 --> 07:00.917
No, man.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.284
Hmm.

07:02.355 --> 07:05.654
Finn and Jake, could you
help me onto Cardamon's back?

07:05.725 --> 07:08.922
I would like to be high in the
clouds, bathed in the pinks

07:08.995 --> 07:10.986
and blues of the
desert twilight,

07:11.063 --> 07:13.258
when I restore my sight.

07:13.332 --> 07:14.663
Sure. Okay.

07:16.302 --> 07:17.530
Climb aboard!

07:17.603 --> 07:20.538
Vanilla! Chocolat!
Cinnamon! Agave!

Oh. Yeah, it's overwhelming.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.269
This view takes me back.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.465
I always loved the sunset...

08:27.540 --> 08:31.340
and the silhouettes of my
little goblins lined up to

08:31.410 --> 08:32.933
receive their spankings!

08:34.647 --> 08:36.808
Well, the past is the past.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.378
I want to thank you
guys for finding my eyes.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.149
I don't know where I got
that idea about the wizard.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.884
You were in the desert
a long time, man.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.687
Yes... 20 years.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.490
Nah, it was more like
one year and change, dude.

08:50.563 --> 08:54.727
Yes, things certainly have
changed for me in that time.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.863
Say, who's ruling the, uh,
Goblin Kingdom since I left?

08:59.939 --> 09:01.566
Whisper Dan.

09:01.641 --> 09:04.166
Oh. Whisper Dan.

09:04.243 --> 09:05.505
That's cool.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.512
Cool. Cool.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.208
Hey, you guys want a
ride back to your crib?

09:10.283 --> 09:11.910
Yeah. Sure, man.

09:15.354 --> 09:16.616
Yup.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.589
Uh, wait.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.649
Xergiok, this is
the Goblin Kingdom.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.717
I know, but I was thinking...

09:22.795 --> 09:26.128
now that I'm wiser,
I could rule as King again.

09:26.198 --> 09:28.530
That idea is terrible.

09:28.601 --> 09:30.762
Well, you know,
I disagree.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.997
And I have my army of bird
friends,

09:33.072 --> 09:35.768
so anyone who disagrees
with me should get a

09:35.841 --> 09:38.901
spanki-i-i-i-i-i-ng!

09:41.781 --> 09:43.510
Hey, Jeff,
is that your <i>real</i> laugh?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.211
No! It's Xergiok!

09:46.285 --> 09:47.115
Oh, Glob!

09:48.521 --> 09:50.716
Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ng!

09:50.790 --> 09:51.722
Ah, dang!

09:51.791 --> 09:53.019
Aaaaah!

09:53.092 --> 09:55.390
Yeah, baby!

09:55.461 --> 09:56.291
Come on, man.

09:56.362 --> 09:57.192
Are you for real?

09:57.263 --> 09:58.821
Attack, birds! Attack!!

09:58.898 --> 10:00.729
Where's the butt
on this thing?

10:00.800 --> 10:02.392
That's sort of
like a butt.

10:02.468 --> 10:03.298
Yeah!

10:05.171 --> 10:06.433
You like that? Huh?

10:07.873 --> 10:09.340
Whoa!

10:09.408 --> 10:10.432
Wait!

10:10.509 --> 10:13.478
Cardamon! Nougat!
Stevia! Dang!

10:13.546 --> 10:15.537
You lost your
friends, dude.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.879
Yeah, I feel myself
hitting bottom again.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.417
Yep. Okay.

10:19.485 --> 10:20.474
Here we go.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.260
Wo-o-o-wo-wong!

10:28.327 --> 10:32.559
Here, Finn... take my eyes
and bury them forever.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.623
I will not
need them again.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.792
Okay, man.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.330
Thanks.

10:38.404 --> 10:39.632
Are you gonna be
all right, man?

10:39.705 --> 10:40.797
It's cool.

10:41.774 --> 10:43.366
Bye!

10:43.442 --> 10:45.603
Dude, that sucks.

10:45.678 --> 10:48.010
I hope he finds peace...
or something.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.181
He's going to the reservoir.

10:51.250 --> 10:54.014
Um... why is he doing that?

10:54.086 --> 10:55.576
Maybe he's thirsty.

10:56.722 --> 10:57.689
Oops.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.418
I guess he was just sad.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.516
Should we save him?

11:00.593 --> 11:01.890
Nah, man, he's fine.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.759
Whoooooooooooooo!

11:04.830 --> 11:05.956
What the?

11:06.032 --> 11:07.659
I found a girlfriend!

11:07.733 --> 11:09.223
I'm in love!

11:09.301 --> 11:10.290
