01:47.553 --> 01:49.020
Oopsie.

01:50.689 --> 01:54.489
Decaf double tall
nonfat capp for Bruce.

01:55.528 --> 01:57.052
You got it, buddy.

01:57.096 --> 01:59.894
That's a wonderful choice,
Bruce.

01:59.932 --> 02:02.958
-Thank you, Sam. Take care.
-It certainly is.

02:03.002 --> 02:07.530
One Caramel Macchiato.
It's very hot.

02:07.573 --> 02:09.473
Good morning.

02:09.508 --> 02:11.408
Vanilla grande no-foam latte.

02:11.444 --> 02:13.105
That's a wonderful choice.

02:13.145 --> 02:15.306
-Thanks, Sam.
-Yeah.

02:16.715 --> 02:18.910
Hey, Sam. They called.
It's time for you to go.

02:18.951 --> 02:21.545
Oh, yeah, it's time.

02:21.587 --> 02:22.554
It's time, buddy.

02:22.588 --> 02:26.615
It's time for me to go now.

02:26.659 --> 02:29.526
It's time for me to go now,
George!

02:29.562 --> 02:30.722
Good luck.

02:30.763 --> 02:33.061
It's time.

02:36.769 --> 02:37.963
It's time now.

02:48.380 --> 02:52.009
Hurry up. The first floor
is two more floors.

02:52.051 --> 02:54.417
Hurry up.

02:54.453 --> 02:57.854
The second floor--
one more floor.

02:57.890 --> 03:01.485
I have to go to Room 324
on the third floor.

03:03.729 --> 03:08.189
Rebecca!

03:08.234 --> 03:09.997
You the one responsible
for this?

03:10.035 --> 03:11.502
I'm sorry.

03:11.537 --> 03:13.903
Too late for sorries.
Get over here and hold her hand.

03:13.939 --> 03:16.100
Are you OK?

03:17.643 --> 03:19.110
Got a live one, Gert.

03:20.579 --> 03:23.343
Good. Come on.
Focus and breathe.

03:23.382 --> 03:25.407
This is it.

03:25.451 --> 03:28.909
This is it.

03:28.954 --> 03:32.913
This is it.

03:32.958 --> 03:34.289
And it's a girl!

03:47.873 --> 03:49.238
It's OK.

04:01.987 --> 04:03.545
What's her name?

04:08.994 --> 04:12.430
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

04:12.464 --> 04:16.992
Lucy Diamond Dawson.

04:23.909 --> 04:29.370
You're my daughter.
I'm your father.

04:36.255 --> 04:39.986
Get them to make the bus stay.
They're leaving.

04:40.025 --> 04:42.016
-I'll get them.
-They're leaving.

04:42.061 --> 04:45.326
Excuse me.
Hang on one second, please.

04:49.468 --> 04:52.164
Becca!

04:52.204 --> 04:54.468
Becca! The bus is going!

04:59.244 --> 05:01.041
Uh-oh.

05:43.122 --> 05:46.387
Didn't you just go to sleep?

05:51.330 --> 05:53.025
Let me see.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.492
OK.

05:57.536 --> 06:02.030
Lucy, you look beautiful
this morning.

06:03.042 --> 06:05.602
You look very beautiful.

06:15.754 --> 06:18.723
Look at that, Lucy. Nose.

06:18.757 --> 06:22.090
OK. Yeah, l--

06:22.127 --> 06:24.095
Oopsie.

07:10.175 --> 07:12.473
What the hell are you
doing to that baby?

07:16.181 --> 07:17.876
What's the matter
with the baby, Sam?

07:17.916 --> 07:22.580
Everything
is just so tiny, tiny.

07:22.621 --> 07:25.249
Will you come over here
and help me?

07:25.290 --> 07:28.748
You know I can't do that.
What does her mother say?

07:28.794 --> 07:31.695
Her mother said,
"This isn't my life...

07:31.730 --> 07:34.096
"and I didn't want
a baby with you.

07:34.133 --> 07:36.499
"I just needed
a place to sleep."

07:36.535 --> 07:39.504
What if the baby's sick?

07:39.538 --> 07:42.336
Bring her over here.

07:42.374 --> 07:46.674
Sam, babies need food
every two hours.

07:51.150 --> 07:56.019
Sorry.
I'm sorry, Lucy in the sky.

07:56.054 --> 07:58.215
You know...

07:58.257 --> 08:00.851
critics and fools said that
that song...

08:00.893 --> 08:04.420
had some mysterious meaning,
but John always said...

08:04.463 --> 08:07.728
it came from a picture
his son Julian drew...

08:07.766 --> 08:10.826
of his friend Lucy O'Connell.

08:12.037 --> 08:15.131
So I made a good choice?

08:15.174 --> 08:20.908
You made
an excellent choice, Sam.

08:20.946 --> 08:24.507
Now, what time does
this little diamond wake up?

08:28.353 --> 08:30.150
What time does
this little diamond wake up?

08:30.189 --> 08:32.419
She wakes up all the time.

08:33.525 --> 08:39.486
Let's just assume
she wakes up at 6:00.

08:39.530 --> 08:44.628
Keep your TV on Nickelodeon.

08:44.670 --> 08:46.297
I want you to feed her first...

08:46.338 --> 08:50.274
when "Hogan's Heroes"
comes on.

08:50.309 --> 08:57.215
And then again.
Wait until "I Dream of Jeannie."

08:57.249 --> 09:03.245
And then, feed her
when "I Love Lucy" comes on.

09:03.288 --> 09:05.381
We have to be quiet.

09:05.424 --> 09:08.120
I've seen nothing.
I know nothing!

09:10.562 --> 09:13.588
Such a nice man for an officer.

09:23.408 --> 09:25.205
What are you doing?

09:25.244 --> 09:27.269
I'm just getting Lucy asleep...

09:27.312 --> 09:29.041
and you're making noise
and everything.

09:29.081 --> 09:31.276
-Oh, sorry.
-We're here for video night.

09:33.185 --> 09:37.747
Eight years every Thursday
video night, and you forgot?

09:37.789 --> 09:38.949
I'm sorry.

09:38.991 --> 09:43.951
It's always every first Thursday
of every month...

09:43.996 --> 09:49.400
video night at Sam's house.
And I forgot.

09:49.434 --> 09:51.061
Yeah, and I forgot.

09:51.103 --> 09:54.072
Becca's gone.
"Gone with the Wind."

09:54.106 --> 09:56.131
1939,
directed by Victor Fleming.

09:56.174 --> 09:57.801
That was a very sad movie.

09:57.843 --> 10:02.576
Here we go.
Everything changes now.

10:02.614 --> 10:05.344
Soon you'll forget about
Wednesday night at IHOP...

10:05.384 --> 10:07.852
and then Friday night
at karaoke...

10:07.886 --> 10:11.322
and I got hit by a car today.

10:11.356 --> 10:13.449
You did?

10:13.492 --> 10:16.655
It was probably that guy
from the V.A.

10:16.695 --> 10:20.096
Did you bring
"Kramer vs. Kramer"?

10:20.132 --> 10:25.126
I see what's happening here.
I see.

10:25.170 --> 10:26.660
So this is all my fault now.

10:26.705 --> 10:28.366
Don't tell me you forgot again.

10:30.309 --> 10:33.335
I broke a date with
a daydream to come here.

10:33.378 --> 10:35.346
It's your mother.

10:35.380 --> 10:39.373
Hi, Robert. Hello, boys.
It's me, Estelle.

10:39.418 --> 10:43.081
Ma, I told you.
Video night's over at 9:00.

10:43.121 --> 10:45.112
It's only 6:30.

10:45.157 --> 10:51.926
Well, I guess
I'll just wait downstairs.

10:51.964 --> 10:53.625
Sure there isn't anything
I can get you?

10:53.665 --> 10:56.657
No, Ma. You can wait downstairs.
That's fine.

10:56.702 --> 10:59.227
OK. See you later, Rob.

10:59.271 --> 11:00.966
Bye, Estelle.

11:02.274 --> 11:05.971
What a pretty baby.
Hi, little baby.

11:06.011 --> 11:08.571
-Doesn't she look smart?
-She does.

11:08.613 --> 11:10.376
She looks smart.

11:10.415 --> 11:12.679
That baby looks so darn smart.

11:12.718 --> 11:16.085
It's amazing how smart she is.

11:16.121 --> 11:17.679
She's very smart.

11:17.723 --> 11:21.022
She really does.
I think she's really beautiful.

11:21.059 --> 11:22.924
Of course she looks smart.

11:22.961 --> 11:25.122
She's already reading the paper.

11:41.913 --> 11:44.677
Double Macchiato,
low fat, low foam.

11:44.716 --> 11:46.445
That's a wonderful choice.

11:50.188 --> 11:53.749
Oh, my God!

11:53.792 --> 11:55.191
An ice cube went down--

11:55.227 --> 11:57.058
Thank you. Oh, my God.

11:57.095 --> 11:58.221
Can I get another drink, please?

11:58.263 --> 12:01.892
Iced cappuccino.
That's a wonderful choice.

12:01.933 --> 12:02.957
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

12:03.001 --> 12:05.561
Annie, I can't take her
to work anymore...

12:05.604 --> 12:07.697
because she's too big now.

12:07.739 --> 12:10.230
-Annie.
-That was her first word.

12:10.275 --> 12:12.800
-Annie.
-See?

12:12.844 --> 12:15.972
People worry you're not smart.

12:17.115 --> 12:18.412
Papa.

12:20.619 --> 12:24.055
Yes. Oh, you smell so good.

12:24.089 --> 12:27.650
You can tell a lot about people
by the way they smell.

12:42.974 --> 12:45.670
Daddy, why does the snow flake?

12:45.710 --> 12:48.804
Because snow--
because snow flakes.

12:48.847 --> 12:51.281
Daddy, what is mustard made of?

12:51.316 --> 12:54.479
Because it's yellow ketchup.

12:54.519 --> 12:56.749
Daddy, why are men bald?

12:56.788 --> 12:59.689
Sometimes they're bald
because their head is shiny...

12:59.724 --> 13:01.555
and they don't have hair on it.

13:01.593 --> 13:04.790
So their head
is just more of their face.

13:04.830 --> 13:06.695
Daddy,
are ladybugs only girls...

13:06.731 --> 13:08.358
or are there boys, too?

13:08.400 --> 13:11.028
And if there are,
what are they called?

13:11.069 --> 13:12.832
Yeah, the Beatles.

13:12.871 --> 13:15.965
Daddy, where does the sky end?

13:16.007 --> 13:17.872
Why does the moon
follow me home?

13:17.909 --> 13:19.206
Why is the sun orange?

13:19.244 --> 13:21.644
Where does the hour go
in Daylight Savings?

13:21.680 --> 13:25.207
Daddy, do I look more
like you or Mommy?

13:28.353 --> 13:30.344
Daddy...

13:31.590 --> 13:34.218
Do you think
she'll ever come back?

13:39.965 --> 13:44.925
Paul McCartney lost
his mother when he was little.

13:44.970 --> 13:49.669
And John Lennon lost his mother
when he was little.

13:49.708 --> 13:54.839
Annie says that sometimes
God picks the special people.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.905
That's what Annie says.

13:59.117 --> 14:02.553
Daddy, did God mean for you
to be like this...

14:02.587 --> 14:04.555
or was it an accident?

14:07.125 --> 14:09.821
What do you mean?

14:09.861 --> 14:11.351
I mean you're different.

14:17.068 --> 14:18.865
But what do you mean?

14:18.904 --> 14:21.532
You're not like other daddies.

14:25.143 --> 14:29.045
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.277
Yeah, I'm sorry.

14:32.317 --> 14:35.252
It's OK, Daddy.

14:36.755 --> 14:40.088
Don't be sorry. I'm lucky.

14:40.125 --> 14:43.253
Nobody else's daddy
ever comes to the park.

14:51.303 --> 14:56.263
Yeah, we are lucky.
Aren't we lucky?

14:56.308 --> 14:57.707
Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity.

14:57.742 --> 15:01.371
Sunnyside up, not too runny.
two sausage links.

15:01.413 --> 15:03.938
French pancakes
instead of buttermilk.

15:03.982 --> 15:06.075
Fruit topping on the side.

15:06.117 --> 15:07.607
The Funny Face special.

15:07.652 --> 15:10.815
I think it's funny when
you say "Funny Face special."

15:10.855 --> 15:13.983
French, not buttermilk.
Fruit topping on the side.

15:14.025 --> 15:15.287
Not on top.

15:15.327 --> 15:17.887
You're getting a funny face.

15:20.665 --> 15:25.693
That's a wonderful choice.
Thank you, Grace.

15:25.737 --> 15:27.898
Thank you
very, very, very, very much.

15:27.939 --> 15:29.065
You got it, Sam.

15:29.107 --> 15:30.597
Is that too big?

15:30.642 --> 15:32.337
I think that's a little too big.

15:32.377 --> 15:35.107
You need a pair of
good, sturdy school shoes.

15:35.146 --> 15:36.272
These are sturdy.

15:36.314 --> 15:38.578
The arches
are very important.

15:38.617 --> 15:40.949
No. Sturdy is boring, Sam.

15:40.986 --> 15:45.616
These shoes light up, OK?

15:45.657 --> 15:50.219
These are really good shoes
for school.

15:50.262 --> 15:51.456
I know. I love them.

15:51.496 --> 15:53.930
I found the most perfect shoes.

15:53.965 --> 15:57.128
They look like the shoes
that Dorothy wore...

15:57.168 --> 15:59.602
played by Judy Garland
in "The Wizard of Oz"...

15:59.638 --> 16:02.698
1939,
directed by Victor Fleming.

16:02.741 --> 16:06.677
These are pink.
These are also Velcro.

16:06.711 --> 16:10.647
They might have
a little arch in there, too.

16:10.682 --> 16:13.378
Sam, these are
probably too big...

16:13.418 --> 16:16.615
but I thought maybe
Lucy would like those.

16:16.655 --> 16:21.319
When we were at the zoo,
she liked the animal prints.

16:21.359 --> 16:23.589
But these are for adults.

16:23.628 --> 16:26.722
But when we went--
I don't know you.

16:26.765 --> 16:27.891
I don't know who you are.

16:27.932 --> 16:29.729
I like these, Daddy.

16:29.768 --> 16:33.534
She knows what she likes.
That's why she likes these.

16:33.571 --> 16:36.131
-Black goes with everything.
-How much are these?

16:36.174 --> 16:38.472
$16.19 with tax.

16:40.445 --> 16:44.006
Because I have $6.25.

16:44.049 --> 16:45.516
That's all you have?

16:45.550 --> 16:48.849
I didn't get my whole check
because I had to go...

16:48.887 --> 16:52.220
to the parent and teacher
meeting this week.

16:52.257 --> 16:55.920
I'm sorry. It's $16.19.

16:55.960 --> 16:59.396
I couldn't go to work
all day that day.

16:59.431 --> 17:02.594
It's OK, Sam, because
I have $3.00 to contribute.

17:02.634 --> 17:06.502
Sam, I've only got
two plus two...

17:06.538 --> 17:12.032
but I need one for stamps,
so 1...2...3.

17:12.077 --> 17:13.907
Joe's got $1.50.

17:13.944 --> 17:18.848
Yeah. So, is that enough?

17:18.883 --> 17:21.407
If there's a God.
I'll count it.

17:22.454 --> 17:24.444
Do we get a balloon with these?

17:26.624 --> 17:30.219
All of us, or just her?

18:07.165 --> 18:09.133
"And I will eat them
here and there.

18:09.167 --> 18:11.567
"I will eat them anywhere."

18:13.071 --> 18:16.666
"I do so like
green eggs and ham.

18:16.708 --> 18:19.074
"Thank you, thank you,
Sam I am."

18:21.179 --> 18:22.874
One more time?

18:22.914 --> 18:24.973
-Yeah.
-OK.

18:25.016 --> 18:28.417
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

18:28.453 --> 18:30.478
"I will eat them with a mouse.

18:30.522 --> 18:32.490
"And I will eat them
here and there.

18:32.524 --> 18:34.355
"Say, I will
eat them anywhere.

18:34.392 --> 18:37.361
"I do so like
green eggs and ham.

18:37.395 --> 18:39.989
"Thank you, thank you,
Sam I am."

18:41.332 --> 18:43.357
One more time?

18:43.401 --> 18:46.234
Daddy, it's my first day
of school tomorrow.

18:46.271 --> 18:49.729
I don't want to be too sleepy.

18:52.877 --> 18:57.075
Everybody says Bob's Big Boy
has the best hamburgers.

18:57.115 --> 19:00.312
Can we go there Wednesday
instead of IHOP?

19:00.351 --> 19:02.842
But Wednesday is IHOP.

19:02.887 --> 19:05.321
Just one time?

19:05.356 --> 19:08.154
Yeah, but Wednesday is IHOP.

19:12.330 --> 19:15.527
Can I read just the beginning?

19:15.567 --> 19:18.536
Just the beginning.

19:18.570 --> 19:21.562
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.843
There are four stages
of a butterfly's life.

19:26.878 --> 19:32.282
The first three stages are
from egg to larva to cocoon.

19:32.317 --> 19:36.686
Last...

19:36.721 --> 19:40.316
They're hard to remember
because there's so many stages.

19:40.358 --> 19:42.826
It's hard to remember.

19:42.861 --> 19:45.921
33 days. It lasts 33 days.

19:45.964 --> 19:50.401
Spiders and insects
are members of the ants--

19:50.435 --> 19:52.699
ants--anthro--

19:52.737 --> 19:56.104
Conner. Anthropod class.

19:56.140 --> 19:58.233
Anthropod class.

19:58.276 --> 20:02.440
However, spiders and insects
are very different.

20:02.480 --> 20:05.643
-Spiders have six legs--
-Eight legs.

20:05.683 --> 20:09.744
Eight legs and two body parts,
and they're called...

20:09.787 --> 20:12.449
Conner. What are you doing?
You know this stuff.

20:12.490 --> 20:13.787
-No, I don't.
-You do know it.

20:13.825 --> 20:16.259
You wrote that part,
remember?

20:16.294 --> 20:19.388
I wanted to do potato bugs
anyway. Oh, forget it.

20:19.430 --> 20:22.558
I think he can make
that boy feel better.

20:23.968 --> 20:25.959
Sorry, Mr. Egg.

20:26.004 --> 20:27.699
What's wrong with your father?

20:27.739 --> 20:29.730
Why's he acts like a retard?

20:29.774 --> 20:31.435
He is.

20:31.476 --> 20:34.070
-Are you?
-No.

20:34.112 --> 20:36.171
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

20:36.214 --> 20:37.203
How do you know?

20:37.248 --> 20:38.545
He told me.

20:38.583 --> 20:39.948
He's a retard.

20:39.984 --> 20:42.214
Well, it takes one to know one.

20:42.253 --> 20:46.417
It's wonderful to have you
for company tonight.

20:46.457 --> 20:49.756
Isn't it wonderful to have
Conner for company, Lucy?

20:51.062 --> 20:54.520
Yeah. "Sorry, Mr. Egg."

20:57.368 --> 21:01.031
"They per..."

21:03.074 --> 21:06.703
"They perched in...

21:06.744 --> 21:08.905
"Si--

21:08.947 --> 21:10.380
silen--"

21:12.584 --> 21:14.609
Silence.

21:14.652 --> 21:17.450
Yeah. Silence.

21:17.488 --> 21:22.425
"They perched in silence
for a long time."

21:22.460 --> 21:26.556
Your teacher gave you
a really hard book this time.

21:26.598 --> 21:29.192
That's really
a hard book to read.

21:29.233 --> 21:34.899
"How can we be so..."

21:37.041 --> 21:39.805
Differ--

21:39.844 --> 21:41.004
Different.

21:41.045 --> 21:43.980
Oh, yeah. OK.

21:44.015 --> 21:50.944
"How can we be so different
and feel so much alike?"

21:50.989 --> 21:52.479
I don't like that book.

21:52.523 --> 21:55.014
Let's read
"Green Eggs and Ham."

21:55.059 --> 21:58.688
Yeah! OK.

21:58.730 --> 22:02.097
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

22:04.369 --> 22:09.068
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

22:09.107 --> 22:11.302
"I am Sam."

22:17.682 --> 22:20.207
Hey, you.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.719
Hey, handsome.

22:26.391 --> 22:29.952
"Premature baby
claims he's Cupid.

22:29.994 --> 22:33.657
"Has arrow to prove it."
You believe that?

22:33.698 --> 22:38.158
But if he has the arrow,
that's the only thing.

22:38.202 --> 22:40.602
You got a good point.

22:40.638 --> 22:44.904
This is the lnternational
House of Pancakes quiz.

22:44.942 --> 22:47.877
And Lucy found the word "beet."

22:47.912 --> 22:51.814
I want to surprise her
and find the word "carrot"...

22:51.849 --> 22:53.248
but it's hiding.

22:53.284 --> 22:55.184
Carrot!

22:55.219 --> 22:58.211
-Where?
-C-a-r-r--carrot.

22:58.256 --> 23:01.020
Carrot. It's right there.

23:02.260 --> 23:06.253
And you're smart.
You would be a good mother.

23:07.999 --> 23:10.433
Do you tell good stories?

23:10.468 --> 23:13.460
-I got stories up the wazoo.
-Really?

23:13.504 --> 23:14.630
You come with me and relax...

23:14.672 --> 23:17.072
and I'll tell you
some nice stories.

23:17.108 --> 23:20.407
Lily, what did I tell you
about selling on my beat?

23:20.445 --> 23:23.608
Put it down on the table.

23:23.648 --> 23:26.446
It's the lnternational
House of Pancakes quiz.

23:26.484 --> 23:27.815
Put your hands behind your head.

23:27.852 --> 23:28.944
What did l--

23:28.986 --> 23:30.544
Do you have any weapons on you?

23:33.357 --> 23:36.451
He touched me
on my private place.

23:38.362 --> 23:42.992
At such a time as this,
Annie's the boss.

23:43.034 --> 23:45.867
First time in 19 years
I actually believe a guy...

23:45.903 --> 23:47.632
when he says he didn't know
she was a hooker.

23:47.672 --> 23:49.503
You say that like
it's a good thing.

23:49.540 --> 23:51.667
Did you brush your teeth?

23:51.709 --> 23:54.701
They don't sound
like they were brushed.

23:56.180 --> 23:59.411
She forgot to brush her teeth.

23:59.450 --> 24:01.475
Let him go.

24:01.519 --> 24:03.646
Says he never spent
the night away from his kid.

24:06.557 --> 24:11.051
Trouble. Oh, boy,
I'm really in trouble.

24:14.332 --> 24:16.994
Are you in trouble, too?

24:20.071 --> 24:22.232
Are you in trouble, too?

24:22.273 --> 24:25.003
Yeah, I'm in trouble, too.

24:27.278 --> 24:32.113
It gives us great insight
into what she must be feeling.

24:32.150 --> 24:34.482
Mr. Dawson,
it's becoming clear...

24:34.519 --> 24:37.977
that she's holding herself
back in the classroom.

24:38.022 --> 24:41.549
It's as if she's literally
afraid to learn.

24:41.592 --> 24:44.720
No one doubts
that you love your daughter.

24:46.564 --> 24:49.590
But the Department
of Child and Family Services...

24:49.634 --> 24:51.158
contacted us.

24:51.202 --> 24:53.329
They shared with us
that your records show...

24:53.371 --> 24:56.306
that your
intellectual capacity...

24:56.340 --> 24:58.740
is around that of a 7-year-old.

25:01.846 --> 25:06.215
Our concern is what happens
when Lucy turns 8.

25:08.019 --> 25:11.011
Mr. Dawson,
do you understand...

25:11.055 --> 25:13.319
what Ms. Wright is trying
to tell you about Lucy?

25:26.204 --> 25:29.605
John wanted to try new things.

25:31.342 --> 25:35.438
And it wasn't Yoko's fault.

25:35.479 --> 25:38.243
No, it wasn't Yoko's fault.

25:39.350 --> 25:44.117
Annie says you can hear it
on The White Album.

25:49.360 --> 25:52.227
Because John wanted
to try new things.

25:58.569 --> 26:05.475
"They perched in silence.
How can we be so diff--"

26:05.509 --> 26:10.845
Diff...diff--
I don't know that word.

26:15.086 --> 26:19.284
Yes, you do. That's the word
that starts with a "D."

26:19.323 --> 26:21.883
I'm tired.

26:21.926 --> 26:24.224
I don't believe you.

26:24.262 --> 26:27.493
Are you calling me a liar?

26:27.531 --> 26:31.228
Yes. I think
you have to read the word.

26:31.269 --> 26:32.930
No.

26:32.970 --> 26:34.369
Yeah, you have to read
that word.

26:34.405 --> 26:35.565
No.

26:35.606 --> 26:37.233
Yeah. Here it is.

26:37.275 --> 26:40.073
There's the picture
where they're all perched.

26:40.111 --> 26:42.238
-Now read the word.
-No!

26:45.616 --> 26:47.777
I won't read the word!

26:47.818 --> 26:50.412
I'm your father...

26:50.454 --> 26:53.753
and I'm telling you
to read the word.

26:53.791 --> 26:57.955
I can tell you to
because I'm your father.

26:57.995 --> 27:00.589
I'm stupid.

27:00.631 --> 27:03.828
-You are not stupid.
-Yes, I am.

27:03.868 --> 27:08.066
You are not stupid,
because you can read that word.

27:09.740 --> 27:12.368
I don't want to read it
if you can't.

27:16.881 --> 27:19.975
No, because it makes me happy.

27:20.017 --> 27:22.884
It makes me happy
hearing you read.

27:27.091 --> 27:33.758
Yeah. It makes me happy
when you're reading.

27:36.200 --> 27:41.502
"They perched in silence
for a long time.

27:41.539 --> 27:44.030
'How can we be so different...

27:44.075 --> 27:46.703
and feel so much alike?'
mused Flitter.

27:46.744 --> 27:48.735
'How can we feel
so different...

27:48.779 --> 27:51.373
and be so much alike?'
wondered Pip.

27:51.415 --> 27:53.781
'l think
this is quite a mystery."'

27:55.553 --> 27:57.350
Keep going.

27:57.388 --> 27:59.913
They have Oreo
ice cream mud pie.

27:59.957 --> 28:01.424
This is so great.

28:01.459 --> 28:03.950
Yeah, this is so great.

28:05.830 --> 28:07.798
And the menu says...

28:07.832 --> 28:11.199
you can have your
favorite breakfast all day.

28:11.235 --> 28:13.669
That's so great, too, you know.

28:13.704 --> 28:16.969
Because you wanted
to come to a new place...

28:17.008 --> 28:20.739
so we came
to a different place.

28:24.315 --> 28:26.943
Hey, guys.
Can I get you coffee?

28:29.153 --> 28:31.519
No, I don't drink coffee.

28:31.555 --> 28:34.922
OK. What can I get you guys?

28:34.959 --> 28:37.757
I'd like the Super Big Boy
with a root beer float, please.

28:37.795 --> 28:40.263
OK. What about you?

28:40.297 --> 28:49.535
I would like to have
two eggs, sunnyside up.

28:49.573 --> 28:51.973
But not runny, OK?

28:52.009 --> 28:53.203
Not runny.

28:53.244 --> 28:56.179
And then I would like
to have French pancakes...

28:56.213 --> 28:58.909
with the fruit topping
on the side.

28:58.949 --> 29:02.385
We don't have French pancakes.

29:02.420 --> 29:03.409
We have French toast.

29:03.454 --> 29:04.819
No, I don't want French toast.

29:04.855 --> 29:07.483
I want French pancakes,
like at IHOP.

29:07.525 --> 29:11.552
Just the same kind
like they have at IHOP.

29:11.595 --> 29:13.927
That's what my favorite
breakfast is, OK?

29:13.964 --> 29:15.431
They're those thin pancakes.

29:15.466 --> 29:18.196
The crepe pancakes?

29:18.235 --> 29:19.532
I don't even want crepes.

29:19.570 --> 29:21.629
I want to have
French pancakes...

29:21.672 --> 29:23.299
with the fruit topping
on the side.

29:23.340 --> 29:26.605
That's what
I want to have, please.

29:26.644 --> 29:27.702
Thank you.

29:27.745 --> 29:30.339
We don't have that, though, sir.

29:30.381 --> 29:32.611
Do you want
regular pancakes and jam--

29:32.650 --> 29:35.813
I don't want something else!
Why did you ask me that?

29:35.853 --> 29:38.413
I'll see.
Maybe they have something--

29:38.456 --> 29:41.448
-Yeah, ask Bob!
-OK.

29:41.492 --> 29:43.483
Ask Bob's Big Boy.

29:43.527 --> 29:45.825
Because the customer's
always right.

29:45.863 --> 29:47.558
I understand that--

29:47.598 --> 29:50.032
The customer's always right.

30:43.120 --> 30:46.351
Because when Lucy comes
through the door...

30:46.390 --> 30:48.881
everybody says, "surprise!"

30:48.926 --> 30:51.486
You gotta stop bouncing
for a second.

30:51.529 --> 30:53.759
You'll say, "surprise!"

30:53.797 --> 30:55.094
Can we keep bouncing?

30:55.132 --> 30:57.623
You'll have to come down.

30:57.668 --> 31:01.297
After Lucy gets here
and we say, "surprise."

31:01.338 --> 31:03.932
So you have to assume
surprise position.

31:03.974 --> 31:06.772
Should we rehearse it
one more time?

31:08.679 --> 31:11.409
Assume the surprise position.

31:11.448 --> 31:13.939
Annie was supposed to warn us.

31:13.984 --> 31:16.009
Brad, hit the light.

31:18.455 --> 31:20.946
Surprise!

31:20.991 --> 31:22.652
It's not her.

31:22.693 --> 31:24.684
Hi. I don't know
if you remember me.

31:24.728 --> 31:26.753
I'm Margaret Calgrove...

31:26.797 --> 31:29.129
Department of
Child and Family Services.

31:29.166 --> 31:31.100
We met at the police station.

31:31.135 --> 31:32.602
Put the present there.

31:32.636 --> 31:34.729
You have to hurry,
because Lucy's coming.

31:34.772 --> 31:36.239
Come on, hide with us.

31:36.273 --> 31:37.900
Come on, over here.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.810
Annie said Lucy's coming up
the stairs right now.

31:45.849 --> 31:48.750
So you have to assume
the surprise position.

31:48.786 --> 31:50.117
I bet she already knows.

31:50.154 --> 31:52.952
Why are you being
a party pooper?

31:52.990 --> 31:54.457
She's coming now.

31:54.491 --> 31:56.482
You have to assume
the surprise position.

31:56.527 --> 31:59.257
Don't touch me.
I've got cooties!

31:59.296 --> 32:00.627
It's contagious!

32:00.664 --> 32:03.497
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your hands off him.

32:03.534 --> 32:04.501
What are you doing
touching my kid?

32:04.535 --> 32:07.265
-Surprise!
-Leave him alone!

32:07.304 --> 32:10.068
Happy birthday.

32:10.107 --> 32:11.472
Daddy?

32:11.508 --> 32:12.736
You don't
have to call him Daddy.

32:12.776 --> 32:15.176
She said you're not
her real father anyway.

32:15.212 --> 32:17.772
She said she was adopted.

32:25.389 --> 32:27.414
Lucy!

32:27.458 --> 32:29.085
Given the fact
that the father...

32:29.126 --> 32:31.356
was arrested
for solicitation...

32:31.395 --> 32:33.158
couldn't control
his emotions...

32:33.197 --> 32:35.324
endangering other children.

32:35.366 --> 32:39.962
No, you can't!
It's her birthday!

32:40.004 --> 32:42.234
Ms. Calgrove also cites...

32:42.273 --> 32:45.265
Mr. Dawson's mental delays
which raise serious questions...

32:45.309 --> 32:47.675
about his ability
to properly parent.

32:47.711 --> 32:49.440
Run!

32:49.480 --> 32:51.175
I find at this time...

32:51.215 --> 32:53.877
it's not in the best interest of
the child to remain in the home.

32:53.917 --> 32:55.578
And I order her detained...

32:55.619 --> 32:59.077
until a formal
jurisdictional hearing.

32:59.123 --> 33:01.614
Mr. Dawson.

33:01.659 --> 33:04.423
Is there anything
you'd like to add?

33:04.461 --> 33:11.162
I wanted to make it
a really special surprise party.

33:11.201 --> 33:15.035
So I went, and I got plates
at the Pic 'n' Save...

33:15.072 --> 33:20.203
in yellow and in pink--
Like a princess.

33:20.244 --> 33:22.735
And then I went
to the toy store...

33:22.780 --> 33:26.045
and I got balloons
with the helium in them.

33:26.083 --> 33:27.311
-Mr. Dawson?
-Yeah.

33:27.351 --> 33:31.754
It sounds like you gave her
such a lovely party.

33:31.789 --> 33:33.552
Yes, I'm sure it was.

33:33.590 --> 33:37.993
Right now, I want to talk to you
about your legal rights.

33:38.028 --> 33:39.859
OK. There's room
at this table...

33:39.897 --> 33:43.264
if anybody wants
to sit next to me.

33:43.300 --> 33:45.165
I just want to talk to you
about your legal rights...

33:45.202 --> 33:49.298
so if you have not already
retained legal counsel...

33:49.340 --> 33:51.638
the court will appoint
someone for you...

33:51.675 --> 33:55.907
to present your case
on January 5. OK?

33:58.882 --> 34:00.679
That's a month from now...

34:00.718 --> 34:04.279
so I come back here
in one month with Lucy.

34:04.321 --> 34:08.849
No, Mr. Dawson. You will have
monitored visits...

34:08.891 --> 34:13.556
two times a week
for two hours.

34:13.597 --> 34:17.054
And now we're moving on
to 4-D, Parker--

34:17.101 --> 34:19.728
What do you mean?

34:19.770 --> 34:25.231
You will see Lucy
two times a week for two hours.

34:25.275 --> 34:28.608
Why isn't Lucy
going home with me?

34:28.645 --> 34:32.911
I want her to go home with me.

34:32.949 --> 34:35.817
Not today.
Thank you, Mr. Dawson.

34:35.853 --> 34:39.812
4-D. Parker vs. Van Wert.
Thank you.

34:39.857 --> 34:42.724
Of course the judge
picked the lawyer.

34:42.760 --> 34:46.252
For God's sake,
put it together.

34:46.295 --> 34:48.025
She's the one who took
Lucy away from you...

34:48.065 --> 34:50.397
so it's time that
you get your own lawyer now.

34:50.434 --> 34:52.333
You guys think I'm guilty?

34:52.369 --> 34:54.837
-No, Sam.
-You didn't kill anybody.

34:54.871 --> 34:56.601
I miss Lucy, Sam.

34:56.639 --> 34:58.335
Me, too.

34:58.375 --> 35:00.002
You need
a personal injury lawyer...

35:00.043 --> 35:02.807
because you have been
personally injured.

35:02.846 --> 35:06.646
When Dustin Hoffman
was trying to keep Billy...

35:06.683 --> 35:08.651
from going back
to Meryl Streep...

35:08.685 --> 35:11.119
his lawyer told him that
it would cost him $15,000...

35:11.155 --> 35:12.554
and that's if we win.

35:12.589 --> 35:15.649
-$15,000!
-And that's if we win.

35:15.692 --> 35:18.354
Don't worry about money, Sam.

35:18.395 --> 35:23.230
Get the best. Century City.
Here. Look at that.

35:23.267 --> 35:24.894
Let me show you
what it looks like.

35:24.935 --> 35:27.768
Rothman, Glenn,
Harrison, and Williams.

35:29.973 --> 35:32.999
This is one of the best ads
I've seen in the Yellow Pages.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.271
So maybe we're going to win.

35:34.311 --> 35:38.441
-We're gonna win.
-One of the best ads I've seen.

35:38.482 --> 35:40.609
With Rothman and Glenn
and Harrison and Williams...

35:40.651 --> 35:42.448
we're gonna win.

35:46.156 --> 35:48.750
Did Fred Kimble call?
I'm already 20 minutes late.

35:48.792 --> 35:51.522
What did Michelle Kresge say?
Was she defensive?

35:51.562 --> 35:52.961
That's ridiculous.

35:52.996 --> 35:54.691
What happened with my car?
Because it wasn't my fault.

35:54.731 --> 35:56.995
Oh, I know.

35:58.869 --> 36:00.962
This is Mr. Dawson.

36:01.004 --> 36:03.837
There was some confusion
with the temp last week--

36:03.874 --> 36:05.273
How do you do? I'm Sam.

36:05.309 --> 36:07.277
Mr. Dawson. It's a pleasure.

36:07.311 --> 36:09.779
Since somebody made a mistake...

36:09.813 --> 36:11.576
unfortunately
we only have a little time.

36:11.615 --> 36:14.015
Hold my calls
unless it's my kid.

36:15.219 --> 36:17.187
That's a wonderful choice.

36:18.388 --> 36:21.186
Can we get you something
to drink?

36:21.225 --> 36:22.852
Is it for free?

36:26.763 --> 36:30.164
-My treat.
-OK. Thank you.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.668
Yeah, I would like
a glass of milk.

36:32.703 --> 36:35.399
Did you get that, Patricia?

36:35.439 --> 36:37.430
Yes.

36:38.742 --> 36:41.677
And Lucy
had an ice cream cake...

36:41.712 --> 36:45.307
with pink flowers--
not white--

36:45.349 --> 36:48.750
and she likes
cherry vanilla because--

36:48.785 --> 36:50.946
If that's Jake Hiller,
put him through.

36:50.988 --> 36:54.515
Jake, no.

36:54.558 --> 36:56.082
So I got cherry--

36:56.126 --> 36:58.594
-Your son's on line two.
-Did you get that?

36:58.629 --> 37:00.119
Tell him to hold
for just one second.

37:00.163 --> 37:01.721
I have to go. The what?

37:01.765 --> 37:04.233
...melted together as orange.

37:04.268 --> 37:06.793
No. Have a nice weekend.

37:06.837 --> 37:09.738
And Brad wanted
a princess on top...

37:09.773 --> 37:12.606
with little pink shoes.

37:12.643 --> 37:14.042
I think there's a--

37:14.077 --> 37:15.738
I think your son's on line two.

37:15.779 --> 37:19.078
Oh, my God. Willy?

37:19.116 --> 37:21.107
Patricia, get Willy back.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.415
Well, keep trying.

37:23.453 --> 37:27.913
Mr. Dawson, quite bluntly,
you can't afford to hire me.

37:27.958 --> 37:32.986
Yeah, because I make
$8.00 an hour at Starbucks.

37:33.030 --> 37:35.726
Per hour. It's an hourly rate.

37:35.766 --> 37:37.495
I could pay you per hour.

37:37.534 --> 37:39.229
Mr. Dawson, I'm sorry,
but I have--

37:39.269 --> 37:43.831
I have to be in court in
eight minutes with the Kresges.

37:43.874 --> 37:47.901
But good luck to you.
Don't give up.

37:47.945 --> 37:50.880
I'm not giving up.
Where am I going?

37:50.914 --> 37:52.313
I can show you out.

37:55.218 --> 37:57.118
Patricia, where are my keys?

37:57.154 --> 38:00.021
This is her
on her first birthday.

38:00.057 --> 38:03.390
December 6.
That's her birthday.

38:03.427 --> 38:05.793
And this is Lucy two years old.

38:05.829 --> 38:09.959
This is Lucy seven years old
on her birthday...

38:10.000 --> 38:12.332
the day they took her away.

38:12.369 --> 38:13.336
Your son's on line two.

38:13.370 --> 38:16.032
Willy, hi.

38:16.073 --> 38:18.974
Jackson told Wyatt he wasn't
my best friend anymore.

38:19.009 --> 38:21.307
Could we possibly talk
about this when I get home?

38:21.345 --> 38:26.373
Willy? Come on, you're
not gonna talk to me now?

38:26.416 --> 38:30.716
I bought a bag of your favorite
lemonade jellybeans.

38:47.471 --> 38:48.870
God!

38:48.905 --> 38:51.499
I hate that stupid coffee table.

38:51.541 --> 38:53.975
How many times, Patricia,
have I told you...

38:54.011 --> 38:56.241
to get rid of
that crappy coffee table?

39:03.053 --> 39:05.351
It's OK.

39:15.532 --> 39:20.560
You have a son, Rita Rothman
Glenn Harrison Williams.

39:20.604 --> 39:24.472
If they took him
away from you...

39:24.508 --> 39:26.442
would you do what
Robert said and got...

39:26.476 --> 39:30.708
the fastest-talking,
four-name lawyer you could?

39:33.350 --> 39:36.717
I may know someone who handles
these kinds of cases.

39:36.753 --> 39:40.621
I'll see if she can help you.
Leave your number with Patricia.

39:40.657 --> 39:42.591
Your therapist
is on line one.

39:42.626 --> 39:44.856
Tell him you can't find me.

39:47.964 --> 39:51.593
I'm gonna leave my number
with you, OK?

39:55.772 --> 40:01.733
I'm ready to make coffee.
Decaf nonfat latte.

40:01.778 --> 40:06.806
It's coffee up to here,
nonfat milk up to here...

40:06.850 --> 40:11.787
and chocolate
or cinnamon sprinkles.

40:11.822 --> 40:13.380
That's pretty good, Sam.
I'll think about it.

40:13.423 --> 40:15.914
We'll come up with a promotion
that's good for you.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.890
But I know what that means.

40:22.933 --> 40:28.166
When I worked as a janitor
at the La Reina Theater...

40:28.205 --> 40:32.073
I asked Mr. Jenkins
if I could be a ticket-taker...

40:32.109 --> 40:34.942
and he said
he would think about it.

40:34.978 --> 40:39.108
And Jimmy Peters got the job.

40:39.149 --> 40:42.118
And he let his friends
in for free.

40:42.152 --> 40:43.949
I promise you, Sam.

40:43.987 --> 40:45.147
We'll come up
with something for you.

40:45.188 --> 40:46.985
You have my word.

40:47.023 --> 40:49.287
Word, words, words.
I need more than that.

40:49.326 --> 40:52.318
I need to make coffee.

40:52.362 --> 40:55.229
I need to pay my lawyer.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.598
I am celebrating
congratulations to us.

40:59.636 --> 41:02.833
These are the moments.
Good night.

41:10.380 --> 41:14.146
By any chance,
did you call your friend?

41:14.184 --> 41:17.278
The one
that does this kind of work?

41:19.322 --> 41:22.450
I don't have her number anymore.

41:22.492 --> 41:25.017
We lost touch.

41:25.061 --> 41:27.723
Yeah, that happens.

41:27.764 --> 41:29.755
If you get
back in touch with her...

41:29.800 --> 41:33.292
and you find her number,
will you call me?

41:33.336 --> 41:35.270
I'm just in the middle of--

41:35.305 --> 41:37.205
It's a special--

41:37.240 --> 41:38.332
Yeah, I'll call you.

41:38.375 --> 41:41.469
OK. Yeah.

41:41.511 --> 41:42.637
Is that the new janitor?

41:42.679 --> 41:46.479
Oh, it's a...

41:46.516 --> 41:48.313
a case I'm helping out with...

41:48.351 --> 41:50.285
sort of a pro bono thing.

41:52.389 --> 41:53.686
What's that supposed to mean?

41:53.723 --> 41:57.853
Cracker went down
the wrong pipe.

41:57.894 --> 42:00.021
You think I don't do pro bono?

42:00.063 --> 42:02.793
Have another glass, please.
On me.

42:02.833 --> 42:06.132
No, on you. It's pro bono.

42:06.169 --> 42:08.103
I do pro bono.

42:08.138 --> 42:10.504
I know. You go, girl.

42:10.540 --> 42:13.168
You just spread that love.
Spread it all around.

42:23.787 --> 42:27.780
Stop. Driver, stop the bus.

42:27.824 --> 42:29.951
Stop the bus.

42:39.236 --> 42:42.797
Wait for me. I got it.

42:42.839 --> 42:45.808
Lucy, he's an hour
and 45 minutes late.

42:45.842 --> 42:48.333
You'll only have
a few minutes left.

42:48.378 --> 42:51.973
You can leave if you want.

42:52.015 --> 42:54.210
-Lucy!
-Daddy?

42:54.251 --> 42:56.344
I'm here. I'm here.

42:56.386 --> 42:58.513
It's Daddy. I told you!

42:58.555 --> 42:59.647
Oh, shoot!

42:59.689 --> 43:02.283
I spilled it all. Hi.

43:04.661 --> 43:06.891
And guess her name is.

43:06.930 --> 43:09.626
Her name is Rita Harrison.

43:09.666 --> 43:11.998
Lovely Rita Meter Maid?

43:12.035 --> 43:15.766
Yeah, and Harrison like George.

43:23.613 --> 43:25.274
Is she going to help us?

43:25.315 --> 43:29.376
She can't help us...

43:29.419 --> 43:31.979
but if she ever finds
her friend's number...

43:32.022 --> 43:37.483
who does this kind of cases,
she's gonna call me.

43:40.797 --> 43:43.493
You've grown.

43:43.533 --> 43:44.966
Have l?

43:45.001 --> 43:47.469
Yeah. Because your ears
are bigger...

43:47.504 --> 43:49.495
and your eyes are older.

43:55.879 --> 44:00.339
Guess what I'm gonna get
when I get my next paycheck?

44:00.383 --> 44:02.681
I'm gonna get
an answering machine...

44:02.719 --> 44:05.552
because then you can call
and leave a message.

44:05.588 --> 44:09.388
You can say,
"Hi. This is Lucy."

44:09.426 --> 44:11.360
We can't afford
an answering machine.

44:11.394 --> 44:14.522
Yeah, because
I'm gonna get a big promotion...

44:14.564 --> 44:17.294
a promotion that's big.

44:17.334 --> 44:19.461
They'll let you make coffee?

44:19.502 --> 44:24.303
Always set
your dreams high, Lucy.

44:26.776 --> 44:29.040
I'm sorry, Daddy.

44:29.079 --> 44:30.842
It was all my fault.

44:30.880 --> 44:34.611
Don't say that.

44:34.651 --> 44:37.347
It was not all your fault,
so don't say that.

44:38.355 --> 44:41.153
I wouldn't want
any daddy but you.

44:47.497 --> 44:49.624
Did you hear that?

44:49.666 --> 44:52.100
I said I was sorry!

44:52.135 --> 44:54.729
I said I didn't want
any daddy but him.

44:54.771 --> 44:57.433
Why don't you write that down?

44:59.576 --> 45:03.706
Let me make sure
that I'm clear here.

45:03.747 --> 45:05.874
Are you telling me
neither of you...

45:05.915 --> 45:07.405
wants custody of your child?

45:07.450 --> 45:09.884
He has created a monster.

45:09.919 --> 45:11.580
He is exactly like him.

45:11.621 --> 45:14.419
Here we go again.
It's the same old story.

45:14.457 --> 45:16.618
The tears and the tears.

45:16.659 --> 45:19.093
Oh, my God.
Are you really--

45:19.129 --> 45:20.596
You cannot stand emotion.

45:20.630 --> 45:23.292
I'm right here with you.
Excuse me.

45:24.501 --> 45:26.059
I'm sorry.

45:26.102 --> 45:30.300
Hi! Did you get in touch
with your friend?

45:30.340 --> 45:32.900
Because I need legal advice now.

45:33.977 --> 45:35.706
You said
I couldn't afford you...

45:35.745 --> 45:38.077
so I have to talk to somebody.

45:43.987 --> 45:48.822
That's why I told you
I would be your lawyer pro bono.

45:48.858 --> 45:53.557
I don't understand
exactly what you mean.

45:53.596 --> 45:56.156
You told me
that you would be my lawyer?

45:56.199 --> 45:57.325
Sam, I'm your--

45:57.367 --> 46:00.302
Golly, because
I must have misunderstood.

46:00.336 --> 46:02.429
I told you that
when we first met.

46:02.472 --> 46:05.236
You said
you would be my lawyer?

46:05.275 --> 46:06.902
Yes. Sam--

46:06.943 --> 46:10.674
You're my lawyer!

46:10.713 --> 46:12.578
That's right. I'm your lawyer.

46:12.615 --> 46:14.583
And I can pay you per hour.

46:14.617 --> 46:16.642
-No, no, no.
-On the hour.

46:16.686 --> 46:18.517
Pro bono. It's free.

46:20.223 --> 46:22.316
My lawyer for free.

46:22.358 --> 46:24.622
Now, you--God.

46:24.661 --> 46:28.688
Thank you.
Because I have to get this.

46:28.731 --> 46:31.427
It's "Urgent, open immediately"

46:31.468 --> 46:33.527
For my lawyer for free!

46:35.405 --> 46:38.169
They want to have you
evaluated by a shrink...

46:38.208 --> 46:42.110
and your appointment is today!
At 3:00.

46:42.145 --> 46:43.669
It's today! It's now.

46:43.713 --> 46:45.647
I don't actually
want to go to a shrink.

46:45.682 --> 46:47.240
Sam, you don't actually
have a choice.

46:47.283 --> 46:48.341
It's court-ordered.

46:48.384 --> 46:51.842
The lady in your office
is crying.

46:54.691 --> 46:56.318
Patricia,
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

46:56.359 --> 46:57.690
Can you get him out of here?

46:57.727 --> 47:00.025
Don't feel bad.

47:00.063 --> 47:01.997
Sam, come with me.

47:02.031 --> 47:03.430
Don't feel bad.

47:03.466 --> 47:05.058
We'll get through this.
Will you excuse us?

47:05.101 --> 47:09.595
It's their turn now, not yours.
Theirs.

47:09.639 --> 47:12.039
If you leave now,
you can make this...

47:12.075 --> 47:13.599
and you have to make it.

47:13.643 --> 47:17.272
But I have to take
the number 13...

47:17.313 --> 47:21.977
downtown Wilshire express
to Grand Street...

47:22.018 --> 47:27.456
then I transfer to the number 34
at Cesar Chavez Avenue...

47:27.490 --> 47:30.152
because that used
to be Brooklyn Avenue...

47:30.193 --> 47:33.026
and my grandfather
had a bakery on it...

47:33.062 --> 47:34.962
when it was Brooklyn Avenue.

47:34.998 --> 47:38.331
I don't think I can get there
at the time I'm supposed to.

47:38.368 --> 47:42.361
Go, for Christ sakes!
Green means "Go."

47:42.405 --> 47:44.771
I don't like to go to shrinks.

47:44.807 --> 47:47.002
You and me both.

47:47.043 --> 47:49.136
Right or left?

47:49.179 --> 47:52.012
Which is it gonna be,
bonehead?

47:52.048 --> 47:53.538
Right turn ahead.

47:53.583 --> 47:54.607
Right on Vermont?

47:54.651 --> 47:56.915
That'll be another 20 minutes,
you idiot!

47:59.055 --> 48:02.786
Did your mommy make you
go to a shrink, too?

48:02.825 --> 48:06.317
No. Well, sort of.

48:06.362 --> 48:08.262
I spent the whole time
talking about her.

48:08.298 --> 48:10.960
Well, that's nice.

48:12.435 --> 48:15.029
-Office.
-Dialing home.

48:15.071 --> 48:17.539
Office! God damn it!

48:19.442 --> 48:22.104
You're going much faster
than everybody else.

48:22.145 --> 48:25.410
I wonder if you noticed that,
because I noticed that.

48:25.448 --> 48:27.245
Go!

48:37.493 --> 48:39.120
No more shrinks.

48:40.129 --> 48:42.529
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dawson...

48:42.565 --> 48:46.126
but if I were you, I wouldn't
waste any more of my time.

48:46.169 --> 48:51.903
Sorry, Mrs. Dawson, but I think
you should put Sam in a home.

48:51.941 --> 48:55.240
Sam in a home.

48:55.278 --> 48:57.371
Mr. Dawson,
you do understand...

48:57.413 --> 48:59.779
that since I'm a
court-appointed psychologist...

48:59.816 --> 49:02.842
the traditional client-therapist
confidentiality...

49:02.885 --> 49:05.183
will be waived.

49:05.221 --> 49:06.916
Do you understand that?

49:06.956 --> 49:09.254
That the confidentiality
will be waived.

49:13.997 --> 49:16.625
Good. Let's begin.

49:16.666 --> 49:21.228
I went to a doctor one time
who had an orange office.

49:21.271 --> 49:26.402
All the walls
were painted orange.

49:26.442 --> 49:30.003
Do you know her?
She has an orange office...

49:30.046 --> 49:32.446
and she's in Van Nuys.

49:32.482 --> 49:34.382
I wanted to ask you about Lucy.

49:34.417 --> 49:35.714
How old is she now?

49:35.752 --> 49:38.983
She's six. She's seven.

49:39.022 --> 49:41.456
She just had a birthday,
I think.

49:43.993 --> 49:45.688
How was that party?

49:49.165 --> 49:50.962
"Before you read
your message...

49:51.000 --> 49:53.969
"press the red button
for record."

49:54.003 --> 49:57.905
Let's start with the O.G.M.

50:00.710 --> 50:04.373
What? I don't know.
I don't think it's working.

50:04.414 --> 50:07.212
I think it's because
it's a used machine.

50:07.250 --> 50:10.913
It's not used. It's pre-owned.

50:10.953 --> 50:14.047
A guy bought it
for his auto shop...

50:14.090 --> 50:15.751
and then he got a secretary.

50:15.792 --> 50:17.350
Testing, 1, 2, 3.

50:17.393 --> 50:19.918
That's a good code.

50:19.962 --> 50:23.693
I can remember that--1, 2, 3.

50:23.733 --> 50:24.995
4, 5, 6.

50:25.034 --> 50:27.002
7, 8, 9.

50:27.036 --> 50:29.266
9, 10, 1 1, 12.

50:29.305 --> 50:30.738
Quick. You're recording.

50:32.642 --> 50:34.576
Hi. This is--

50:34.610 --> 50:37.511
Hi. This is Sam.
I'm not home.

50:37.547 --> 50:40.015
No, you really
don't want to say that...

50:40.049 --> 50:43.985
because you don't want
to tell them you're not home.

50:44.020 --> 50:46.682
-Then I'm lying.
-Everybody's lying.

50:46.723 --> 50:48.782
Sam, you are on the air.

50:48.825 --> 50:51.123
Hi. How are you?

50:51.160 --> 50:54.857
Maybe you sound
a little bit too excited.

50:54.897 --> 50:58.890
And maybe you might think
about lowering your voice...

50:58.935 --> 51:00.698
so maybe Lucy can hear you.

51:00.737 --> 51:02.261
Go, Sam.

51:02.305 --> 51:08.039
Hi, Lucy.
Thank you for calling me.

51:08.077 --> 51:10.568
That was good.

51:10.613 --> 51:13.548
But did I sound like
a good father?

51:16.018 --> 51:18.646
But it's an outgoing message...

51:18.688 --> 51:22.283
so I think you need to sound
a little more outgoing.

51:22.325 --> 51:25.419
Hi. This is Sam.
I'm not ho--Shoot.

51:25.461 --> 51:27.759
Hi. This is Sam !

51:27.797 --> 51:33.235
I think you should
sound like a normal person.

51:33.269 --> 51:36.432
From the heart.

51:36.472 --> 51:38.064
From the heart.

51:38.107 --> 51:41.133
This is--Hello.
Thank you for calling.

51:41.177 --> 51:43.042
This is Sam.

51:43.079 --> 51:44.410
Wow.

51:44.447 --> 51:48.781
I feel that was a very touching
moment right there.

51:48.818 --> 51:50.911
I felt that one.

51:50.953 --> 51:53.922
High-five.

51:55.124 --> 51:58.890
We have a lot to go over,
and I have five minutes.

51:58.928 --> 52:01.522
Rothman, Glenn,
Harrison, Williams...

52:01.564 --> 52:03.259
is on the 29th floor.

52:03.299 --> 52:04.823
That's 29 floors up...

52:04.867 --> 52:07.631
and the elevators
are actually over there.

52:07.670 --> 52:11.162
Keep up.
Got to do my cardio. 120.

52:11.207 --> 52:13.266
Got to get to 125
to make it count.

52:13.309 --> 52:16.506
I need that list of names
from you...

52:16.546 --> 52:18.537
people who can testify
that you're a good father...

52:18.581 --> 52:19.878
despite your handicap.

52:19.916 --> 52:23.374
Just my husband.
I didn't mean your handicap.

52:23.419 --> 52:25.444
I meant your disability.

52:25.488 --> 52:28.150
The fact that you're retarded--
that's not the right word.

52:28.191 --> 52:29.715
I don't know what to call you.

52:31.727 --> 52:34.127
Sam. You can call me Sam.

52:34.163 --> 52:38.725
All right! Hello. Hi, Todd.

52:38.768 --> 52:41.328
I was out of range.
How you doing?

52:42.772 --> 52:45.570
What do you mean,
what's that supposed to mean?

52:47.376 --> 52:50.209
You're supposed
to be taking him to karate.

52:50.246 --> 52:53.409
Are you eating?
No, I will not hold on.

52:53.449 --> 52:54.575
Go pick him up.

52:54.617 --> 52:57.518
I can't hear you.
I'm in the car.

52:57.553 --> 52:59.953
They put you through to me.

52:59.989 --> 53:02.253
I'm losing you.

53:03.726 --> 53:07.059
What makes Sam a good father?

53:07.096 --> 53:11.556
The important thing is for
Sam to be a very good father...

53:11.601 --> 53:14.161
is to be there for her...

53:14.203 --> 53:20.540
because the smarter Lucy is,
the smarter she will get.

53:23.045 --> 53:25.377
So what makes Sam a good father?

53:25.414 --> 53:28.178
Lucy's first word was "Annie..."

53:28.217 --> 53:32.210
and her fifth word was "Joe."

53:32.255 --> 53:33.620
And I'm Joe.

53:37.059 --> 53:40.495
Sam is a very good father...

53:40.530 --> 53:44.022
because he likes green things...

53:44.066 --> 53:45.795
Like I like green things
very much.

53:45.835 --> 53:48.167
I like green peas.

53:48.204 --> 53:50.604
My cousin Luke works for
the organization--

53:50.640 --> 53:52.904
environmental organization
Greenpeace...

53:52.942 --> 53:55.001
and they like
to save the whales.

53:55.044 --> 53:56.534
I like whales.

53:56.579 --> 53:59.013
"Moby Dick" was one of my
all-time favorite classics...

53:59.048 --> 54:00.276
by Herman Melville.

54:00.316 --> 54:02.784
Wait.
Why are you recording this?

54:02.818 --> 54:04.877
It's often necessary--

54:04.921 --> 54:06.479
You didn't say anything
about a tape recorder.

54:06.522 --> 54:09.491
-Who's listening?
-Me.

54:09.525 --> 54:11.686
What is that supposed to mean?

54:11.727 --> 54:12.887
Nothing.

54:12.929 --> 54:15.454
Who are you really?

54:17.767 --> 54:19.394
I need to speak
to my lawyer now.

54:40.690 --> 54:42.954
I don't think you realize
what you're up against.

54:42.992 --> 54:45.256
We have to be in court
in three days...

54:45.294 --> 54:46.989
and we don't have
a decent witness.

54:47.029 --> 54:49.429
Now, you've got to know
someone who can testify...

54:49.465 --> 54:50.796
who's been to college...

54:50.833 --> 54:53.267
or has a degree of some kind...

54:53.302 --> 54:56.294
or has some way
of expressing themselves...

54:56.339 --> 54:59.172
that will make the court
believe you deserve...

54:59.208 --> 55:00.175
to get your daughter back.

55:00.209 --> 55:03.770
I need coffee. Big, tall.

55:03.813 --> 55:05.804
Tall is the smallest.

55:05.848 --> 55:07.372
Yeah, of course.

55:07.416 --> 55:09.316
Once you think of this person...

55:09.352 --> 55:14.483
and there has to be one person,
call me at work.

55:14.523 --> 55:17.424
Because
I'm going back there now...

55:17.460 --> 55:21.988
to my seven other cases. What?

55:22.031 --> 55:25.489
Mrs. Robeck. I'm on the 405.

55:25.534 --> 55:27.001
The traffic is horrible.

55:27.036 --> 55:29.630
You want this
for here or to go?

55:29.672 --> 55:31.435
Dorothy?

55:32.441 --> 55:33.965
Oh, no. No.

55:34.010 --> 55:37.138
Tow truck is towing your car.

55:37.179 --> 55:39.010
Son of a bitch.

55:39.048 --> 55:40.845
It's towing your car.

55:40.883 --> 55:45.013
No, wait! Stop!
It's my car. Stop.

55:45.054 --> 55:47.386
But, Annie, it's just one day.

55:47.423 --> 55:51.154
And Lucy needs you
because you went to college...

55:51.193 --> 55:55.562
and you can
give the right answers.

56:04.040 --> 56:07.441
And we can't lose her.

56:09.845 --> 56:12.746
I'd make it worse for you.

56:12.782 --> 56:15.250
I can't do it.

56:15.284 --> 56:18.117
Don't you think I would
if I could?

56:21.857 --> 56:25.122
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Phillip McNeilly.

56:31.567 --> 56:32.864
Hi, guys.

56:32.902 --> 56:34.631
Hi, Sam.

56:34.670 --> 56:36.763
Boy, you did a wonderful job
making those signs.

56:36.806 --> 56:39.604
You're welcome, Sam.
Good luck, buddy.

56:39.642 --> 56:41.200
Go get 'em.

56:43.112 --> 56:45.376
Although,
at her birthday party...

56:45.414 --> 56:49.475
I believe her true feelings
about her father were revealed.

56:49.518 --> 56:51.884
Objection.
"True feelings revealed"?

56:51.921 --> 56:53.980
Your Honor,
Ms. Davis is an expert...

56:54.023 --> 56:56.218
appointed by the court
for her opinion.

56:56.258 --> 56:57.350
I'll allow it.

56:57.393 --> 56:59.327
Then every child who rages...

56:59.361 --> 57:01.352
because they
didn't get to stay up...

57:01.397 --> 57:03.422
that extra hour to watch TV--

57:03.466 --> 57:04.956
Any child who said
they hated their parents...

57:05.000 --> 57:06.262
because
they didn't want a bath...

57:06.302 --> 57:08.270
would be a prime candidate
for foster care?

57:08.304 --> 57:10.932
-Objection, Your Honor.
-Sustained.

57:10.973 --> 57:13.066
I think they want you to stop.

57:13.109 --> 57:15.304
Really?

57:15.344 --> 57:17.403
Thank you, Sam.

57:17.446 --> 57:19.846
Yeah, OK.
Brad's wearing a tie today...

57:19.882 --> 57:22.908
and I think the tie
looks wonderful on you, Brad.

57:22.952 --> 57:24.817
You look great, too.

57:28.124 --> 57:30.649
There's a lady--
she's writing everything down.

57:30.693 --> 57:33.753
Watch what you say.

57:33.796 --> 57:36.663
I have the best friends
in the whole world.

57:36.699 --> 57:40.328
Continue with your witness,
Mr. Turner.

57:40.369 --> 57:43.805
Ms. Davis, I assume
in your therapy session...

57:43.839 --> 57:47.502
that Mr. Dawson extolled
his parenting ability.

57:47.543 --> 57:49.101
On the contrary.

57:49.145 --> 57:55.209
Mr. Dawson admitted
he felt very confused at times.

57:55.251 --> 57:57.310
Actually,
that he felt terrified...

57:57.353 --> 58:00.789
that he'd made and would
continue to make--

58:00.823 --> 58:04.691
and I can quote here--

58:04.727 --> 58:07.059
"Huge mistakes,
huge mistakes...

58:07.096 --> 58:08.563
"mistakes that are huge."

58:08.597 --> 58:12.795
Thank you.
No further questions.

58:12.835 --> 58:14.393
You're a mother,
aren't you, Ms. Davis?

58:14.436 --> 58:16.336
Yes, I am.

58:16.372 --> 58:20.433
Would it be fair to say that...

58:20.476 --> 58:23.843
as a parent, you've been
confused from time to time...

58:23.879 --> 58:26.177
possibly overwhelmed
on occasion...

58:26.215 --> 58:27.648
even though
you're a wonderful mother?

58:27.683 --> 58:30.174
If Ms. Davis
has never had a moment...

58:30.219 --> 58:31.481
where she's been confused
as a mother...

58:31.520 --> 58:34.353
it would bias
her expert opinion.

58:34.390 --> 58:37.223
I know that I have
many moments as a parent...

58:37.259 --> 58:39.784
where I felt
I've made huge mistakes.

58:39.829 --> 58:41.524
Objection.

58:41.564 --> 58:43.589
Get to the relevant point,
Ms. Harrison.

58:43.632 --> 58:45.691
The point is, you've never
had those moments...

58:45.734 --> 58:47.258
have you, Ms. Davis?

58:47.303 --> 58:50.431
Moments that every parent
I've ever spoken to has.

58:50.472 --> 58:53.930
Moments where the task is
so unbelievably challenging...

58:53.976 --> 58:55.841
that you feel retarded...

58:55.878 --> 58:57.743
disabled in some way.

58:57.780 --> 59:01.238
Moments where everyone seems
to have the key but you.

59:01.283 --> 59:02.807
Really, to be honest--

59:02.852 --> 59:04.717
Yes or no?
Please answer the question.

59:04.753 --> 59:06.778
I didn't really
feel right now--

59:06.822 --> 59:08.255
Let me rephrase the question.

59:08.290 --> 59:10.554
-When your son O.D.'d--
-Objection.

59:10.593 --> 59:12.959
If Ms. Davis didn't feel
she had made mistakes...

59:12.995 --> 59:14.223
mistakes that were huge...

59:14.263 --> 59:16.458
it might bias her opinion
toward Mr. Dawson.

59:16.498 --> 59:18.227
I'll allow it.

59:18.267 --> 59:21.395
Ms. Davis,
when your son O.D.'d...

59:21.437 --> 59:25.874
did you feel that you
might have made mistakes...

59:25.908 --> 59:27.842
mistakes that were huge?

59:31.180 --> 59:33.171
Yes.

59:35.084 --> 59:36.210
Yes.

59:36.252 --> 59:38.152
No further questions.

59:42.491 --> 59:44.425
You made her cry.

59:44.460 --> 59:45.518
I got lucky.

59:45.561 --> 59:47.995
Oh, no.
That's not nice to make her cry.

59:48.030 --> 59:49.156
Only in there.

59:49.198 --> 59:52.998
And your secretary
when you hated your desk.

59:54.370 --> 59:57.669
Green and yellow
on the same plate.

59:57.706 --> 01:00:00.470
Could you separate
the lima beans...

01:00:00.509 --> 01:00:02.443
from the corn, please?

01:00:02.478 --> 01:00:05.242
Sam, don't be impossible.

01:00:05.281 --> 01:00:07.841
Can I have
the spinach omelette--

01:00:07.883 --> 01:00:10.010
only egg whites,
no fat, no oil, no butter.

01:00:10.052 --> 01:00:12.077
-And extra mushrooms?
-Absolutely.

01:00:14.757 --> 01:00:16.122
My treat.

01:00:16.158 --> 01:00:17.819
-No, no, no--
-My treat.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.350
My pro bono.

01:00:19.395 --> 01:00:23.456
That means she doesn't
have to pay. I pay.

01:00:27.403 --> 01:00:29.371
Sam, do you really
want to get this...

01:00:29.405 --> 01:00:32.431
or are you just trying to...

01:00:32.474 --> 01:00:35.932
trying to act like a...

01:00:36.946 --> 01:00:39.471
What do you mean?

01:00:41.817 --> 01:00:44.684
You know, like--Never mind.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.711
I'm a grownup.

01:00:46.755 --> 01:00:49.019
I didn't say that.

01:00:49.058 --> 01:00:50.389
You think what they think.

01:00:50.426 --> 01:00:53.827
You're my lawyer,
and you think what they think?

01:00:53.862 --> 01:00:55.329
I don't have a chance.

01:00:55.364 --> 01:00:58.231
I think...

01:00:58.267 --> 01:00:59.962
you deserve a fair trial.

01:01:00.002 --> 01:01:01.993
Do you think what they think?

01:01:02.037 --> 01:01:05.370
Sam can't order food
or Sam can't pay a check.

01:01:05.407 --> 01:01:07.307
Sam can't take care of Lucy?

01:01:07.343 --> 01:01:10.005
It doesn't matter what I think.
It matters that we win.

01:01:10.045 --> 01:01:11.740
It matters what you think.

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.874
It doesn't matter to them
what I think.

01:01:14.917 --> 01:01:17.351
It matters to me!

01:01:18.354 --> 01:01:21.255
It matters to me!

01:01:27.963 --> 01:01:33.128
$14.33.
That's five ones...

01:01:36.472 --> 01:01:39.498
Two quarters. 14.33.

01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:42.032
Five ones and two quarters.

01:01:47.516 --> 01:01:52.112
And 17 cents less than 20.

01:01:56.291 --> 01:01:59.283
Dr. Blake, what would you say
kept you going...

01:01:59.328 --> 01:02:02.855
the 12 years
you were in medical school?

01:02:02.898 --> 01:02:05.560
Caffeine and doughnuts...

01:02:05.601 --> 01:02:09.401
and my mother's belief in me.

01:02:09.438 --> 01:02:11.269
I wish I had a mother like that.

01:02:11.306 --> 01:02:12.500
She must have been smart.

01:02:12.541 --> 01:02:14.441
She had great instincts.

01:02:14.476 --> 01:02:17.968
Do you happen to know
what her l.Q. was?

01:02:18.981 --> 01:02:22.917
In the lower ranges.
About 70.

01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:26.387
So your mother...

01:02:26.422 --> 01:02:28.890
this woman who had
the mind of a 9-year-old...

01:02:28.924 --> 01:02:31.722
had the wisdom to recognize
you would be a great doctor.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.992
Yes. I can't say
it was always easy...

01:02:36.031 --> 01:02:40.400
but she taught me the things
they can't teach.

01:02:40.436 --> 01:02:43.405
Patience and compassion.

01:02:43.439 --> 01:02:45.805
Traits most doctors
have in spades.

01:02:45.841 --> 01:02:47.706
Mr. Dawson.

01:02:47.743 --> 01:02:51.144
You've become
a wonderful girl...

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.909
and we're proud of you.

01:02:52.948 --> 01:02:57.317
Lucy will be, too.
She'll be wonderful.

01:02:57.352 --> 01:02:59.445
He's very enthusiastic.
Thank you, Doctor.

01:02:59.488 --> 01:03:01.581
No further questions.
Come on, come on.

01:03:01.623 --> 01:03:04.353
How'd you get through medical
school? Where'd you live?

01:03:04.393 --> 01:03:06.020
We lived with
my mother's parents.

01:03:06.061 --> 01:03:10.020
-Grandma and Grandpa.
-Yes.

01:03:10.065 --> 01:03:11.760
Would it be fair to say
that Grandma and Grandpa...

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.462
were of normal intelligence?

01:03:14.503 --> 01:03:15.868
And so,
would it be fair to say...

01:03:15.904 --> 01:03:18.065
that Grandma and Grandpa
of normal intelligence...

01:03:18.107 --> 01:03:19.335
had the real responsibilities?

01:03:19.374 --> 01:03:23.868
Objection. Mr. Turner's
mother-in-law lives with him.

01:03:23.912 --> 01:03:26.676
Motion to strike. Irrelevant,
immaterial, and immature.

01:03:26.715 --> 01:03:28.205
I warn you, Ms. Harrison...

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:31.185
stick to the relevant
issues of the case.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:32.619
Your Honor, the relevancy
is that every parent...

01:03:32.654 --> 01:03:34.121
has a right
to a support system.

01:03:34.156 --> 01:03:35.487
I'm not talking about
the rights of the parents.

01:03:35.524 --> 01:03:37.321
I'm talking about
the rights of the child.

01:03:38.594 --> 01:03:39.788
Please let the record show--

01:03:39.828 --> 01:03:41.090
Excuse me. Your Honor...

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:42.791
I'm talking about entrusting
an 8-year-old's welfare...

01:03:42.831 --> 01:03:45.231
in the hands of someone
whose record shows...

01:03:45.267 --> 01:03:47.633
has been diagnosed
with autistic tendencies...

01:03:47.669 --> 01:03:48.795
mental retardation--

01:03:48.837 --> 01:03:51.397
Objection. Move to
strike that from the record.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.567
It is clear that
one's intellectual capacity...

01:03:53.609 --> 01:03:56.169
has no bearing
on their ability to love.

01:03:56.211 --> 01:03:58.771
Your Honor, would you
please instruct counsel...

01:03:58.814 --> 01:04:01.612
to proceed with
a modicum of sensitivity?

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:03.083
I'm very sensitive...

01:04:03.118 --> 01:04:04.676
especially when
I see someone like you...

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.813
walk in here and try
to give meaning to your life...

01:04:06.855 --> 01:04:08.083
by screwing up somebody else's.

01:04:08.123 --> 01:04:10.057
That's enough. Ms. Harrison,
approach the bench.

01:04:10.092 --> 01:04:11.525
My mother raised me--

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.687
Tearing apart a family
is truly noble work, Mr. Turner.

01:04:13.729 --> 01:04:15.663
That's enough.

01:04:15.697 --> 01:04:17.187
This is an award for you
at some luncheon...

01:04:17.232 --> 01:04:18.859
but I'm here every day.

01:04:18.901 --> 01:04:20.664
You win, you're out the door.

01:04:20.702 --> 01:04:25.105
You know who I see come back?
The child.

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.574
Only this time, it's too late.

01:04:27.609 --> 01:04:31.306
So am I sensitive?
Yeah, I'm a little sensitive.

01:04:31.346 --> 01:04:33.337
You can't even touch that area.

01:04:33.382 --> 01:04:37.318
Your Honor,
please let the record show...

01:04:37.352 --> 01:04:39.411
my mother raised me.

01:04:46.662 --> 01:04:50.029
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt

01:04:50.065 --> 01:04:53.159
His name is my name, too

01:04:53.202 --> 01:04:56.535
Whenever we go out,
the people always shout

01:04:56.572 --> 01:04:59.234
They say, "John Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt"

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.605
Excuse me. Time is up.

01:05:07.649 --> 01:05:10.049
Please, just a little more.

01:05:10.085 --> 01:05:12.383
No. I have another case at 2:30.

01:05:12.421 --> 01:05:14.753
I need to go to the bathroom.

01:05:19.995 --> 01:05:21.428
Daddy!

01:05:21.463 --> 01:05:23.192
Daddy!

01:05:23.232 --> 01:05:24.460
She said we could
go to the park.

01:05:24.499 --> 01:05:27.935
What happened?
What made her change her mind?

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:29.130
I started
crying in the bathroom...

01:05:29.171 --> 01:05:31.298
so she thought
we needed more time.

01:05:32.774 --> 01:05:34.503
There's the park.

01:05:34.543 --> 01:05:37.808
Let's not get off.
Let's keep going.

01:05:37.846 --> 01:05:41.282
No, Lucy, that would be wrong.

01:05:41.316 --> 01:05:43.250
Tamara's mommy lost her case...

01:05:43.285 --> 01:05:45.583
and she hasn't seen her
in six years.

01:05:45.621 --> 01:05:49.216
She had five different mommies,
and one of them hit her.

01:05:49.258 --> 01:05:52.125
I would never
let that happen to you.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.094
That's what
her real mommy said...

01:05:54.129 --> 01:05:57.360
and now they won't even
let her talk to her.

01:05:57.399 --> 01:05:58.866
Daddy.

01:06:00.936 --> 01:06:03.496
It's the only way
to be together.

01:06:03.538 --> 01:06:05.369
We'll start a new life...

01:06:05.407 --> 01:06:08.968
get new names,
live in a new apartment...

01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:11.172
and they'll never find us.

01:07:06.935 --> 01:07:08.664
That's Rita. Hi!

01:07:09.971 --> 01:07:12.997
It's 3:00 in the morning. Hi!

01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:15.168
What were you thinking?

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:17.007
What were you possibly thinking?

01:07:17.045 --> 01:07:18.376
I wanted to be with Lucy.

01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:19.880
That's ridiculous!

01:07:19.915 --> 01:07:21.678
Willy, stay here with me.

01:07:21.717 --> 01:07:24.515
What could you possibly gain
by kidnapping your kid...

01:07:24.553 --> 01:07:25.850
in the middle
of a custody hearing?

01:07:25.887 --> 01:07:27.912
-Lucy told me--
-I don't want to hear it!

01:07:27.956 --> 01:07:29.753
Can you possibly
explain this to me?

01:07:29.791 --> 01:07:33.454
-Who is the goddamn parent?
-Me.

01:07:33.495 --> 01:07:35.622
Willy, stay in the hallway.

01:07:35.664 --> 01:07:37.564
I am deeply disturbed by this.

01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:40.898
Lucy, I would have
expected more from you.

01:07:40.936 --> 01:07:43.734
I can imagine
what you're thinking...

01:07:43.772 --> 01:07:45.137
but I ask you this--

01:07:45.173 --> 01:07:46.697
What parent
in their right mind...

01:07:46.742 --> 01:07:50.007
seeing their child's pain,
their yearning for contact...

01:07:50.045 --> 01:07:51.945
wouldn't take them
in an effort to comfort them?

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:53.277
You need to understand...

01:07:53.315 --> 01:07:55.283
something very important
about the father--

01:07:55.317 --> 01:07:56.750
Yes, and if I were you...

01:07:56.785 --> 01:07:59.447
I'd look at my conscience
long and hard...

01:07:59.488 --> 01:08:01.319
before I tried
to use this in court.

01:08:01.356 --> 01:08:03.415
Is that a threat?

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:08.828
No! It's...a plea.

01:08:08.864 --> 01:08:10.525
Give him a break.

01:08:13.568 --> 01:08:15.798
Just give him one goddamn break.

01:08:17.305 --> 01:08:21.571
Lucy, say your good-byes.
It's time to go.

01:08:24.112 --> 01:08:25.841
Willy, it's time to go home.

01:08:28.984 --> 01:08:31.384
Goddamn it, Willy!

01:08:33.587 --> 01:08:36.386
Please don't fire us.

01:08:36.425 --> 01:08:38.551
It was all my idea.

01:08:38.593 --> 01:08:41.823
Please don't.

01:08:41.863 --> 01:08:43.125
Please.

01:08:50.305 --> 01:08:53.138
Raise your right hand.

01:08:53.175 --> 01:08:55.904
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

01:08:55.944 --> 01:08:58.377
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:08:58.412 --> 01:09:00.176
So help me God.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:07.120
I heard you turned seven
this year.

01:09:07.154 --> 01:09:08.622
That's pretty exciting.

01:09:08.657 --> 01:09:11.490
Everybody gets older.
It's not that big a deal.

01:09:11.526 --> 01:09:14.290
What'd you get
for your birthday?

01:09:14.328 --> 01:09:16.627
I haven't opened
my presents yet.

01:09:16.665 --> 01:09:19.497
Really? That's odd. Why?

01:09:23.904 --> 01:09:25.805
Actually, I opened my presents.

01:09:25.841 --> 01:09:29.332
I got the "Help" album,
limited edition.

01:09:32.514 --> 01:09:36.644
I'm sorry. I'm very confused.

01:09:36.685 --> 01:09:39.620
I thought you didn't
open your presents...

01:09:39.654 --> 01:09:41.622
because you ran away
from your own party...

01:09:41.656 --> 01:09:44.523
because your best friend
told everyone...

01:09:44.559 --> 01:09:45.719
that you said you were adopted.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.091
I never said that.
Why would I say that?

01:09:48.129 --> 01:09:50.029
Why would your friend say that?

01:09:50.064 --> 01:09:52.033
Kids lie all the time.

01:09:53.667 --> 01:09:57.627
-Remember you're under oath.
-I know.

01:09:57.672 --> 01:10:01.335
-And you know what that means?
-I do.

01:10:02.944 --> 01:10:05.538
Now that we have all agreed
to tell the truth...

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:08.140
where were you sleeping
last night?

01:10:10.619 --> 01:10:12.109
In my bed at the foster home.

01:10:14.523 --> 01:10:16.388
If you're not going to
tell the truth, I am.

01:10:16.424 --> 01:10:17.789
Your dad kidnapped you
last night.

01:10:17.826 --> 01:10:19.919
-Objection. Kidnapped?
-Sustained.

01:10:19.961 --> 01:10:24.625
Young lady,
you have to tell the truth.

01:10:24.666 --> 01:10:25.928
You're lying
because you're afraid.

01:10:25.967 --> 01:10:27.798
Objection.
He's putting words in her mouth.

01:10:27.836 --> 01:10:29.360
Sustained.

01:10:29.404 --> 01:10:31.565
Please limit yourself
to questions, Mr. Turner.

01:10:31.606 --> 01:10:33.699
You have to tell the truth.

01:10:33.742 --> 01:10:35.710
Lucy, are you
afraid to tell the truth...

01:10:35.744 --> 01:10:37.575
because you'll hurt
your Daddy's feelings?

01:10:37.612 --> 01:10:41.309
Daddy's right here.
You can tell the truth.

01:10:41.349 --> 01:10:44.978
Isn't it true
that very deep down inside...

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:48.285
you know you need much more
than your daddy can give you?

01:10:59.768 --> 01:11:01.963
All you need is love.

01:11:07.242 --> 01:11:09.301
Where did she go?

01:11:13.848 --> 01:11:15.907
Please, God.

01:11:15.951 --> 01:11:19.352
Please, God.

01:11:19.387 --> 01:11:22.982
Please, God.

01:11:23.024 --> 01:11:24.582
These responsibilities
include...

01:11:24.626 --> 01:11:26.958
busing tables, replenishing
the Sweet 'n Lows...

01:11:26.995 --> 01:11:29.395
sweeping up the place?

01:11:29.431 --> 01:11:30.523
Yes.

01:11:30.565 --> 01:11:32.430
Aren't these Mr. Dawson's
only responsibilities?

01:11:32.467 --> 01:11:34.901
Because he doesn't have
the mental capacity...

01:11:34.936 --> 01:11:39.771
to run a cash register
or even make a cup of coffee.

01:11:39.808 --> 01:11:41.105
As a matter of fact...

01:11:41.142 --> 01:11:42.541
Sam and I were
discussing a promotion...

01:11:42.577 --> 01:11:44.272
we were going to put
into effect next week.

01:11:44.312 --> 01:11:47.770
Hooray for me!
Thank you, George.

01:11:47.816 --> 01:11:49.283
Thank you, George.
That's very nice.

01:11:49.317 --> 01:11:52.115
After eight years,
Sam can make a cup of coffee...

01:11:52.153 --> 01:11:54.553
and he can certainly
help Lucy with her geometry.

01:11:54.589 --> 01:11:55.556
Objection.

01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:58.320
And when I ask
another question...

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.590
-I answer in one sentence.
-Short and sweet.

01:12:00.629 --> 01:12:03.894
Yes. One sentence.
Short and sweet.

01:12:03.932 --> 01:12:05.866
Tim Curry was
a sweet transvestite...

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.868
in
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show."

01:12:07.902 --> 01:12:10.166
Let's try one word.

01:12:10.205 --> 01:12:12.139
Annie!

01:12:12.173 --> 01:12:17.076
You're here! You're here!

01:12:17.112 --> 01:12:18.909
Susan Sarandon is also
one of my favorite actresses.

01:12:18.947 --> 01:12:21.006
Besides being
Lucy's godmother...

01:12:21.049 --> 01:12:22.846
aren't you also
her piano teacher?

01:12:22.884 --> 01:12:24.476
Yes.

01:12:24.519 --> 01:12:26.680
Annie plays the piano
beautifully.

01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:28.689
You really do, Annie.

01:12:28.723 --> 01:12:31.556
Sam, it's Annie's turn now.

01:12:31.593 --> 01:12:34.027
And didn't you graduate
magna cum laude...

01:12:34.062 --> 01:12:35.893
from the
Juillard School of Music?

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:37.363
Summa cum laude.

01:12:37.399 --> 01:12:40.562
Excuse me.

01:12:40.602 --> 01:12:43.264
Ms. Cassell, in all the time
you've known them...

01:12:43.304 --> 01:12:47.604
have you ever questioned
Sam's ability as a father?

01:12:47.642 --> 01:12:50.907
-Never.
-Never?

01:12:50.945 --> 01:12:53.573
Look at Lucy. She's strong.

01:12:53.615 --> 01:12:56.982
She displays true empathy
for people...

01:12:57.018 --> 01:12:59.179
all kinds of people.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.778
I know that you all think...

01:13:00.822 --> 01:13:04.121
she's as smart as she is
despite him...

01:13:04.159 --> 01:13:06.593
but it's because of him.

01:13:06.628 --> 01:13:08.186
So, what you're saying is...

01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:10.424
you don't worry
about Lucy's future.

01:13:10.465 --> 01:13:12.126
No. I do.

01:13:14.736 --> 01:13:17.705
I...

01:13:17.739 --> 01:13:20.902
I worry all the time.

01:13:23.378 --> 01:13:27.644
If they take Lucy
away from her father...

01:13:27.682 --> 01:13:31.948
they will take away
an enormous piece of her...

01:13:31.986 --> 01:13:37.549
and I worry that she will spend
the rest of her life...

01:13:37.592 --> 01:13:41.653
trying to fill that hole.

01:13:43.031 --> 01:13:45.397
Thank you, Ms. Cassell.

01:13:45.433 --> 01:13:47.128
No further questions.

01:13:49.003 --> 01:13:52.097
Thank you for coming here
today, Annie.

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:56.600
You're welcome, Sam.

01:13:56.644 --> 01:13:58.305
Can Sam add?

01:13:58.346 --> 01:14:00.814
Yes.

01:14:00.849 --> 01:14:03.044
What about multiplication?

01:14:03.084 --> 01:14:04.483
He's learning.

01:14:04.519 --> 01:14:07.852
What does that mean?
He can't multiply two times two?

01:14:07.889 --> 01:14:11.518
I don't know about you,
Mr. Turner...

01:14:11.559 --> 01:14:13.959
but my memories of my parents...

01:14:13.995 --> 01:14:17.123
have nothing to do with
the times table...

01:14:17.165 --> 01:14:19.633
or with state capitals.

01:14:19.667 --> 01:14:22.397
A truck ran into
the state capital building...

01:14:22.437 --> 01:14:25.463
and it went on fire
on television.

01:14:25.507 --> 01:14:28.305
I saw that on the news with
the reporter with the toupee...

01:14:28.343 --> 01:14:30.538
and Mr. Turner lost his toupee.

01:14:30.578 --> 01:14:33.274
Thank you, Mr. Wali.

01:14:36.017 --> 01:14:39.817
I bet
he's knocking on your door...

01:14:39.854 --> 01:14:41.185
asking questions all the time.

01:14:41.222 --> 01:14:43.986
Yes. All the time.

01:14:44.025 --> 01:14:47.290
Let's see.
The last question...

01:14:47.328 --> 01:14:50.661
was whether to use
Biz or Clorox...

01:14:50.698 --> 01:14:53.826
to get the grass stains
out of Lucy's soccer uniform.

01:14:56.905 --> 01:15:00.204
Eventually,
Lucy will go through puberty.

01:15:00.241 --> 01:15:02.539
How much insight or know-how...

01:15:02.577 --> 01:15:06.035
will he bring to
those sensitive subjects...

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.775
of a young girl's development?

01:15:07.816 --> 01:15:09.181
I can only imagine how much...

01:15:09.217 --> 01:15:11.651
insight and sensitivity
you yourself would bring...

01:15:11.686 --> 01:15:13.881
to that delicate area,
Mr. Turner...

01:15:13.922 --> 01:15:15.856
or any father, for that matter.

01:15:18.326 --> 01:15:20.089
And you've had plenty
of opportunity...

01:15:20.128 --> 01:15:21.152
to observe fathers,
haven't you?

01:15:21.196 --> 01:15:22.595
Objection.

01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:25.531
The fact that Ms. Cassell
hasn't left her room in...

01:15:25.567 --> 01:15:27.694
I don't know
how many years...

01:15:27.735 --> 01:15:29.532
must have some effect
on her perception.

01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:33.564
I'll allow it.
Please answer the question.

01:15:35.343 --> 01:15:38.437
I have had 28 years
in the real world...

01:15:38.479 --> 01:15:41.073
and...

01:15:41.115 --> 01:15:44.881
I have been able to observe
all kinds of fathers.

01:15:44.919 --> 01:15:47.615
What about your father?

01:15:50.892 --> 01:15:52.917
Ms. Cassell...

01:15:52.961 --> 01:15:54.724
since you seem to be
such an expert...

01:15:54.762 --> 01:15:56.559
on father-daughter
relationships.

01:16:08.943 --> 01:16:12.936
I'm sorry, Ms. Cassell.
I need to hear your response.

01:16:14.415 --> 01:16:16.246
What about your father?

01:16:21.589 --> 01:16:23.489
What about your father?

01:16:23.524 --> 01:16:25.014
Objection to that.

01:16:25.059 --> 01:16:26.617
Excuse me, Mr. Dawson. Please.

01:16:26.661 --> 01:16:30.324
-Overruled.
-That's overruled.

01:16:30.365 --> 01:16:33.493
Mr. Dawson, please sit down.

01:16:33.534 --> 01:16:35.900
Overruled.

01:16:35.937 --> 01:16:38.405
Mr. Dawson, sit down!

01:16:38.439 --> 01:16:41.408
Annie's father was a meanie.

01:16:41.442 --> 01:16:45.742
Sam has his big day
on the stand tomorrow...

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.714
and we need to do
a little bit of work...

01:16:47.749 --> 01:16:49.649
so he's as effective
as you were.

01:16:49.684 --> 01:16:54.178
I want to be as effective
as you were, Annie.

01:16:54.222 --> 01:16:57.089
On the Porsche,
the door handle...

01:16:57.125 --> 01:16:59.958
is a little hidden
by that thingamajig.

01:16:59.994 --> 01:17:01.655
So, if you're having
trouble finding it--

01:17:01.696 --> 01:17:03.254
No!

01:17:03.298 --> 01:17:08.565
I think maybe Annie's
not exactly ready to go yet.

01:17:08.603 --> 01:17:10.366
We'll just take our time.

01:17:12.573 --> 01:17:15.201
-Home.
-Dialing office.

01:17:15.243 --> 01:17:18.906
-Home.
-Dialing office.

01:17:18.947 --> 01:17:21.347
Home, god damn it!

01:17:21.382 --> 01:17:23.612
I'm ready now.

01:17:23.651 --> 01:17:25.551
Good. Fine.

01:17:25.586 --> 01:17:28.054
Sam, Annie's ready.

01:17:48.876 --> 01:17:50.707
Wow!

01:17:51.879 --> 01:17:53.813
Let's work in the den.
It's down here.

01:18:13.067 --> 01:18:15.763
Hey, Willy. Where's your dad?

01:18:15.803 --> 01:18:17.566
Guess.

01:18:17.605 --> 01:18:19.129
I don't want to guess.
Where is he?

01:18:19.173 --> 01:18:21.607
Where was he last night?

01:18:21.642 --> 01:18:23.303
Working. Late.

01:18:23.344 --> 01:18:24.709
There. You guessed it.

01:18:24.746 --> 01:18:26.839
Did he say who was
supposed to take care of you?

01:18:26.881 --> 01:18:29.611
You. But you said
you were working late, too.

01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:31.675
I am working late.

01:18:34.689 --> 01:18:35.781
How was your day?

01:18:35.823 --> 01:18:37.814
You have to work. Go work.

01:18:37.859 --> 01:18:39.554
How was your--

01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:43.220
Hello? Where are you?

01:18:43.264 --> 01:18:45.323
I've been waiting here an hour.

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:55.407
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

01:18:55.443 --> 01:18:58.037
You were on line two.

01:18:58.079 --> 01:18:59.671
You don't sound
like you're on the freeway.

01:19:04.819 --> 01:19:09.188
Danger, Will Robinson. Danger.

01:19:14.195 --> 01:19:16.629
There you are.

01:19:16.664 --> 01:19:19.929
You gonna come see the movie?
It's the best part.

01:19:19.967 --> 01:19:22.800
It's getting late.
We better get to work.

01:19:27.308 --> 01:19:28.935
It's time to get ready for bed.

01:19:33.281 --> 01:19:34.908
Willy, it's time for bed.

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.151
Our strategy is...

01:19:40.188 --> 01:19:42.247
we're aggressively pursuing
a support system.

01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:43.621
I'm going to ask you...

01:19:43.658 --> 01:19:46.422
"How are you prepared
to help Lucy at school?"

01:19:46.461 --> 01:19:49.362
Let me see. Let me see.

01:19:49.397 --> 01:19:51.763
Sam, I told you,
you have to stop saying that.

01:19:51.799 --> 01:19:54.461
It makes you look stupid.

01:19:54.502 --> 01:19:57.903
OK, try again.

01:19:59.507 --> 01:20:01.475
You say
you will find her a tutor.

01:20:01.509 --> 01:20:02.976
Then I say,
"How will you pay for it?"

01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:06.343
Could you slow down?

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:09.349
Why do you eat so fast?

01:20:09.383 --> 01:20:11.351
We have been over this
a million times.

01:20:11.385 --> 01:20:13.615
Yeah.

01:20:13.654 --> 01:20:16.953
You found her a free
tutoring service at the YWCA.

01:20:16.991 --> 01:20:19.585
But I didn't. You did.

01:20:23.898 --> 01:20:29.131
Can you grasp the concept of...

01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:30.933
manipulating the truth?

01:20:30.972 --> 01:20:32.439
Not lying.

01:20:32.473 --> 01:20:35.909
Just a little tweak
here and there.

01:20:38.346 --> 01:20:39.813
No.

01:20:44.585 --> 01:20:45.916
You're so lucky.

01:20:45.953 --> 01:20:49.354
You get to play with Willy
any time you want.

01:20:51.926 --> 01:20:54.053
He doesn't
want to play with me.

01:20:55.963 --> 01:20:58.761
Yes, he does.

01:20:58.799 --> 01:21:01.063
Yes, he does. He does.

01:21:01.102 --> 01:21:03.798
He thinks
you don't want to play, maybe.

01:21:03.838 --> 01:21:05.863
That's ridiculous.
Of course I do.

01:21:07.475 --> 01:21:08.669
Tweak.

01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:12.145
I drove around after work
yesterday till 9:30...

01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:16.276
Iooking for
that frigging Raptor scooter!

01:21:28.095 --> 01:21:31.462
So, what made you harass
that young boy at your house?

01:21:31.499 --> 01:21:36.527
I didn't harass that boy,
and you know it, Rita.

01:21:36.571 --> 01:21:40.098
I'm pretending to be Mr. Turner.
Remember?

01:21:46.147 --> 01:21:50.243
If I look at you,
I'm gonna laugh again.

01:21:54.989 --> 01:21:57.355
OK, Mr. Turner.

01:21:57.391 --> 01:21:59.825
I'm Mr. Turner. All right?

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:03.159
Isn't Lucy already
smarter than you?

01:22:03.197 --> 01:22:05.597
You buried yourself.
You've got to do better.

01:22:05.633 --> 01:22:09.626
I kind of think
we're the same smart.

01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:10.728
What does that mean?

01:22:10.771 --> 01:22:13.467
I know the bus routes
better than she does.

01:22:13.507 --> 01:22:16.203
How does that make you
the same smart?

01:22:18.446 --> 01:22:20.971
Doesn't every parent
want their kid to be smart?

01:22:21.015 --> 01:22:23.882
That's true,
but the issue here is that...

01:22:23.918 --> 01:22:27.479
at the age of seven,
Lucy is smarter than you.

01:22:27.521 --> 01:22:32.458
But in some ways,
I'm smarter than she is.

01:22:32.493 --> 01:22:34.825
You got to be firm on this.

01:22:40.568 --> 01:22:44.402
In some ways, she's--

01:22:44.438 --> 01:22:47.305
In some ways,
I'm smarter than her.

01:22:47.341 --> 01:22:50.538
In some ways, I'm smarter
than you, Mr. Turner.

01:22:50.578 --> 01:22:54.309
In some ways, I'm smarter
than you, Judge McNeilly.

01:22:54.348 --> 01:22:58.045
Whoa. Take it down.

01:23:05.693 --> 01:23:07.160
Want some marshmallows?

01:23:07.194 --> 01:23:09.822
This is my husband's.
He'll never notice.

01:23:09.864 --> 01:23:11.832
He has ten more just like it.

01:23:14.402 --> 01:23:15.630
Try it on.

01:23:17.805 --> 01:23:19.432
Will you look that way?

01:23:19.473 --> 01:23:20.963
In there.

01:23:25.046 --> 01:23:30.040
I wasn't exactly sure
how to tie this.

01:23:30.084 --> 01:23:32.018
Does it look bad?

01:23:36.757 --> 01:23:39.590
No. Very, very good.

01:23:45.333 --> 01:23:48.791
Cross over once.

01:23:48.836 --> 01:23:52.795
And loop this around...

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:57.868
and up inside of the neck.

01:23:57.912 --> 01:24:03.077
And then pull up
on the skinny part.

01:24:04.518 --> 01:24:07.214
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:24:20.401 --> 01:24:22.767
Today's your big day, buddy.
Making coffee.

01:24:27.942 --> 01:24:31.002
-You ready?
-Thank you, George.

01:24:31.045 --> 01:24:32.205
What time
you got to be in court?

01:24:32.246 --> 01:24:36.148
I have to be
on the stand at 2:00.

01:24:36.183 --> 01:24:40.916
Two venti Caramel Macchiatos.
That's a wonderful choice.

01:24:40.955 --> 01:24:45.153
Two cappuccinos
and a Hazelnut Frappuccino.

01:24:45.192 --> 01:24:47.752
Two Orange Mocha Chip
Frappucinos.

01:24:47.795 --> 01:24:51.162
Two Caramel Frappucinos and a--

01:24:51.198 --> 01:24:54.292
I'm sorry. Can you
tell me that one more time?

01:24:54.335 --> 01:24:57.099
Everybody's very thirsty today.

01:24:57.138 --> 01:24:59.663
Oh, boy.

01:24:59.707 --> 01:25:02.801
I'm going as fast as I can.
That's the only thing.

01:25:02.843 --> 01:25:04.674
But I don't have all day.

01:25:04.712 --> 01:25:07.510
No, just another
couple of minutes.

01:25:07.548 --> 01:25:08.572
Not all day.

01:25:08.616 --> 01:25:11.084
You know what? Fine.
Forget it. Thank you.

01:25:13.387 --> 01:25:16.618
Sam, I need that tall decaf
vanilla drip right away.

01:25:18.125 --> 01:25:20.787
A vanilla drip. Sorry.

01:25:22.329 --> 01:25:23.523
Sorry.

01:25:25.232 --> 01:25:28.395
I really have to hurry, though.

01:25:28.436 --> 01:25:30.495
Is that enough? Oh, shoot.

01:25:30.538 --> 01:25:32.472
Maybe you want something else.

01:25:32.506 --> 01:25:35.634
Sam, I need
a grande soy latte...

01:25:35.676 --> 01:25:37.507
but don't put any whipped cream
or foam on it.

01:25:37.545 --> 01:25:40.139
I'm just trying to go
really fast.

01:25:43.417 --> 01:25:46.250
-Oh, no!
-Sam, you'll be late.

01:25:49.757 --> 01:25:52.419
Your Honor, I'm sure
he'll be here any moment.

01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:55.486
This is an extremely
important day to Mr. Dawson.

01:25:55.529 --> 01:25:57.997
I'm here!

01:25:58.032 --> 01:25:59.499
Sorry.

01:25:59.533 --> 01:26:02.001
Your Honor, may I have a moment
to confer with my client?

01:26:02.036 --> 01:26:03.333
Make it brief, Ms. Harrison.

01:26:03.370 --> 01:26:05.895
What the hell happened to you?

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.965
-I'm late.
-What's that smell? Mint?

01:26:08.008 --> 01:26:11.205
No, no. The blender exploded.

01:26:11.245 --> 01:26:12.212
Look at me.

01:26:12.246 --> 01:26:14.544
Slow down,
because Lucy needs you.

01:26:14.582 --> 01:26:16.209
Yeah, Lucy needs me.

01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:17.740
We need you, Ms. Harrison.

01:26:17.785 --> 01:26:20.811
I go in there now,
because it's my turn.

01:26:20.855 --> 01:26:22.482
Go sit.

01:26:25.826 --> 01:26:29.159
How will you be able
to pay for private tutoring?

01:26:29.196 --> 01:26:34.657
There's a free program
at the YWCA...

01:26:34.702 --> 01:26:38.661
and Lucy can go to that program.

01:26:38.706 --> 01:26:40.901
Don't you ever think
it would be better for Lucy...

01:26:40.941 --> 01:26:44.342
if she lived with
a permanent foster family...

01:26:44.378 --> 01:26:45.675
and you could visit
whenever you wanted?

01:26:45.713 --> 01:26:50.650
No, I don't think
that's a very good idea, see.

01:26:50.684 --> 01:26:55.678
Because the Fosters,
they don't know Lucy.

01:26:55.723 --> 01:26:58.783
And I know Lucy
because I'm her father.

01:26:58.826 --> 01:27:03.024
So, I think
if they want to see her...

01:27:03.063 --> 01:27:08.091
then the Fosters can come over
to our house to visit her.

01:27:08.135 --> 01:27:11.070
And I'm very firm on this.

01:27:11.105 --> 01:27:18.637
I'm very firm on this idea,
because Lucy belongs with me.

01:27:19.647 --> 01:27:20.841
Why?

01:27:30.457 --> 01:27:34.553
Remember when Paul McCartney
wrote the song "Michelle"...

01:27:34.595 --> 01:27:38.429
and then he only wrote
the first part, Annie said.

01:27:38.465 --> 01:27:41.298
And then he gave
that part to John Lennon...

01:27:41.335 --> 01:27:43.098
and he wrote the part
that said...

01:27:43.137 --> 01:27:45.901
"I love you,
I love you, I love you."

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:48.374
Annie said
that it wouldn't have been...

01:27:48.409 --> 01:27:50.502
the same song without that...

01:27:50.544 --> 01:27:53.274
and that's why
the whole world cried...

01:27:53.314 --> 01:27:57.910
when the Beatles broke up
on April 10, 1970.

01:28:03.457 --> 01:28:06.017
No further questions.

01:28:07.628 --> 01:28:09.960
So, your parents put you
in an institution.

01:28:12.266 --> 01:28:15.758
My mother got sick, see...

01:28:15.803 --> 01:28:17.862
so I had to go in
an institution...

01:28:17.905 --> 01:28:19.930
when my mother got sick.

01:28:19.974 --> 01:28:22.340
What about your father?
Where was he?

01:28:22.376 --> 01:28:25.868
He was gone when I was born.

01:28:25.913 --> 01:28:29.872
He went away when I was born.

01:28:29.917 --> 01:28:33.375
So the people at the institution
were your parents.

01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:34.910
Were they nice to you?

01:28:34.955 --> 01:28:38.220
Some, yes. Some, no.

01:28:38.258 --> 01:28:39.691
Did they hit you?

01:28:39.727 --> 01:28:42.628
Sometimes they did hit me.
Yeah.

01:28:42.663 --> 01:28:45.325
Like you hit Lucy's friend
at her birthday party?

01:28:45.366 --> 01:28:47.027
Objection. Mistakes
the facts and evidence.

01:28:47.067 --> 01:28:48.329
Nobody hit anybody.

01:28:48.369 --> 01:28:50.337
I'll rephrase that.
Strong-armed.

01:28:51.905 --> 01:28:55.432
So, who do you look up to?

01:28:55.476 --> 01:28:56.841
Who do you want to be like...

01:28:56.877 --> 01:29:00.210
as a father
when parenting Lucy?

01:29:00.247 --> 01:29:02.477
The head of the institution?
The principal? The warden?

01:29:02.516 --> 01:29:06.748
Not Mr. Whitehead. Not him.

01:29:06.787 --> 01:29:08.550
Then who?

01:29:11.759 --> 01:29:13.021
Who?

01:29:15.529 --> 01:29:18.987
Myself.

01:29:19.033 --> 01:29:23.766
I look up to myself as a father.

01:29:23.804 --> 01:29:29.037
Mr. Dawson, you have
the capacity of a 7-year-old.

01:29:29.076 --> 01:29:31.806
What makes you think you have
the ability to be a father?

01:29:31.845 --> 01:29:33.403
Your background, your IQ...

01:29:33.447 --> 01:29:35.210
your friends
who can't even testify--

01:29:35.249 --> 01:29:37.717
Objection.
Compound questions.

01:29:37.751 --> 01:29:39.446
-Objection!
-Sustained.

01:29:39.486 --> 01:29:41.477
They love Lucy, see.

01:29:41.522 --> 01:29:44.980
Even if Rita didn't think
they were smart enough...

01:29:45.025 --> 01:29:47.858
to testify, they love Lucy.

01:29:47.895 --> 01:29:50.455
Yeah. I love Lucy.

01:29:50.497 --> 01:29:53.295
Even if Rita thought
you'd wipe the floor with them.

01:29:53.333 --> 01:29:55.961
Mr. Dawson,
your lawyer just objected.

01:29:56.003 --> 01:29:58.403
You didn't have to answer
that question.

01:29:58.439 --> 01:29:59.599
You can't even follow
simple rules...

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.403
you've been observing
day after day.

01:30:01.442 --> 01:30:03.603
-Objection. Your Honor--
-Overruled.

01:30:03.644 --> 01:30:07.136
What makes you think
you can raise a 7-year-old?

01:30:07.181 --> 01:30:08.944
A 10-year-old? A 13-year-old?

01:30:08.982 --> 01:30:10.540
You know what that means?

01:30:10.584 --> 01:30:14.418
She'll be six years
more advanced than you.

01:30:15.622 --> 01:30:17.419
What makes you think
you can do that?

01:30:17.458 --> 01:30:21.918
What makes you think
you can do that?

01:30:21.962 --> 01:30:23.452
What makes you think
you can do that?

01:30:26.366 --> 01:30:29.631
I...

01:30:29.670 --> 01:30:33.902
have had a lot
of time, see, to...

01:30:33.941 --> 01:30:36.307
think about what it is...

01:30:36.343 --> 01:30:40.336
that makes somebody
a good parent...

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:44.578
and it's about constancy...

01:30:44.618 --> 01:30:46.745
and it's about...

01:30:51.325 --> 01:30:55.887
patience,
and it's about listening...

01:30:55.929 --> 01:30:59.490
and it's about
pretending to listen...

01:30:59.533 --> 01:31:03.629
even when
you can't listen anymore.

01:31:03.670 --> 01:31:07.197
And it's about love,
like she said.

01:31:07.241 --> 01:31:10.369
See, Billy has a home with me...

01:31:10.410 --> 01:31:13.641
and I made it the best I could.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.341
And it's not perfect...

01:31:15.382 --> 01:31:18.579
and I'm not a perfect parent...

01:31:18.619 --> 01:31:21.850
and sometimes I don't have
enough patience...

01:31:21.889 --> 01:31:25.825
and I forget
he's just a little kid...

01:31:25.859 --> 01:31:30.023
but we built a life
together...

01:31:30.063 --> 01:31:32.861
and we love each other.

01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:35.596
And if you destroy that...

01:31:35.636 --> 01:31:40.938
it'll be irre--irrep--

01:31:40.974 --> 01:31:42.498
Let me see. Let me see.

01:31:48.649 --> 01:31:50.708
-Irreparable.
-Yep!

01:31:50.751 --> 01:31:51.911
Yes. Yes.

01:31:51.952 --> 01:31:54.318
Joanne, don't do that, please.

01:31:54.354 --> 01:31:56.879
Don't do it twice.
Not to him.

01:31:56.924 --> 01:32:00.826
Meryl Streep can't even look
at Dustin Hoffman after that.

01:32:03.864 --> 01:32:05.491
"Kramer vs. Kramer."

01:32:07.601 --> 01:32:09.899
Thank you, Mr. Wali,
for that commentary.

01:32:09.937 --> 01:32:13.566
Your Honor, my client
is understandably upset.

01:32:13.607 --> 01:32:14.665
Motion to recess.

01:32:14.708 --> 01:32:17.836
I don't exactly
like recess very much.

01:32:17.878 --> 01:32:20.108
Motion denied.

01:32:20.147 --> 01:32:22.047
Continue with your witness,
Mr. Turner.

01:32:22.082 --> 01:32:24.482
Mr. Dawson...it's hard.

01:32:24.518 --> 01:32:28.420
I know it's hard to know what
to say to Lucy half the time.

01:32:28.455 --> 01:32:30.889
Right? ls it?

01:32:30.924 --> 01:32:32.186
No.

01:32:32.226 --> 01:32:34.524
No? Was that a no?

01:32:34.561 --> 01:32:36.461
No what?

01:32:36.496 --> 01:32:38.555
Let me see.

01:32:40.934 --> 01:32:43.402
I don't know exactly.

01:32:43.437 --> 01:32:45.132
I'm sorry, Mr. Dawson.
You don't know what?

01:32:45.172 --> 01:32:47.470
I don't...yeah.

01:32:47.507 --> 01:32:48.804
OK. Yeah.

01:32:48.842 --> 01:32:50.139
Yes? Yes, you don't know.

01:32:50.177 --> 01:32:52.372
Right? You don't know...

01:32:52.412 --> 01:32:55.040
what it takes
to raise your daughter.

01:32:55.082 --> 01:32:56.106
Objection.

01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:58.117
These are not questions.
This is an attack.

01:32:58.151 --> 01:32:59.118
Overruled.

01:32:59.152 --> 01:33:01.950
I'm Lucy's father.

01:33:01.989 --> 01:33:04.253
-I'm her father.
-Are you really?

01:33:04.291 --> 01:33:05.588
I'm not talking
about the fact...

01:33:05.626 --> 01:33:07.924
that you got
some homeless woman pregnant.

01:33:07.961 --> 01:33:09.326
Objection, Your Honor!

01:33:09.363 --> 01:33:12.230
Get to the question, Mr. Turner.

01:33:12.266 --> 01:33:17.329
The question is,
if you love your daughter...

01:33:17.371 --> 01:33:19.464
as much as you say you do--

01:33:19.506 --> 01:33:21.770
and I know that you do--

01:33:21.808 --> 01:33:24.174
don't you think
she deserves more?

01:33:25.512 --> 01:33:26.570
Don't you
in your heart of hearts...

01:33:26.613 --> 01:33:29.514
secretly question yourself
every day?

01:33:29.549 --> 01:33:31.176
Objection. Compound questions.

01:33:31.218 --> 01:33:33.152
OK, yeah!

01:33:33.186 --> 01:33:34.585
I'm sorry. Was that a yes?

01:33:34.621 --> 01:33:37.454
I think
Lucy deserves everything.

01:33:37.491 --> 01:33:41.450
In my heart of hearts,
I think she deserves everything.

01:33:41.495 --> 01:33:42.587
Yes, she does.

01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:45.462
-Yeah, OK.
-Yes, she does.

01:33:45.499 --> 01:33:47.524
And you agree
with everyone here...

01:33:47.567 --> 01:33:50.934
that you can't give her that.

01:33:50.971 --> 01:33:54.099
Maybe everybody's right, see.

01:33:54.141 --> 01:33:57.269
Maybe everybody's right
about that, see.

01:33:57.311 --> 01:33:59.802
So no more now, OK?

01:33:59.846 --> 01:34:04.010
No more now. No more.

01:34:04.051 --> 01:34:09.887
I want to stop right now!

01:34:09.923 --> 01:34:13.324
This is the end of this for me.

01:36:49.316 --> 01:36:52.444
Your teacher told me
you're a wonderful artist.

01:36:52.486 --> 01:36:55.319
So I was thinking maybe--

01:36:55.355 --> 01:36:57.220
Daddy's coming today.

01:36:58.792 --> 01:37:00.885
We're going to open
my birthday presents.

01:37:00.927 --> 01:37:03.327
You must be so excited.

01:37:03.363 --> 01:37:05.524
Why don't you just go
and do something?

01:38:31.051 --> 01:38:34.578
Sam, it's me. Open up.

01:38:34.621 --> 01:38:37.283
I don't have time for this.

01:38:37.324 --> 01:38:40.725
You were supposed to show up
to your first evaluation...

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:42.694
and I leave work early
to be there...

01:38:42.729 --> 01:38:45.562
and where the hell are you?
Open the door!

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:48.995
Sam, open the goddamn door.

01:38:50.837 --> 01:38:53.465
If you don't care enough to
open the door, I'm out of here.

01:38:53.506 --> 01:38:57.306
I've ruined my practice.
I've alienated my colleagues.

01:38:57.344 --> 01:38:59.539
I sent my kid off on a fishing
trip with his father...

01:38:59.579 --> 01:39:01.069
so that I could work with you...

01:39:01.114 --> 01:39:04.049
and you won't open
the goddamn door for me!

01:39:04.084 --> 01:39:05.881
Fine! That's it! I've had it!

01:39:29.042 --> 01:39:31.636
Sam, can I come in?

01:39:36.583 --> 01:39:38.448
Not really room here.

01:39:38.485 --> 01:39:41.113
There's no room here.

01:39:41.154 --> 01:39:45.215
Yeah, well, I lived
in the East Village.

01:39:45.258 --> 01:39:46.657
I don't need a lot of room.

01:39:46.693 --> 01:39:47.853
Because I make things--

01:39:47.894 --> 01:39:50.454
everything is too hard
on everybody.

01:39:50.497 --> 01:39:54.331
I make everything hard
on everybody.

01:39:54.367 --> 01:39:56.267
I can go...

01:39:58.271 --> 01:40:01.001
at least another nine rounds.

01:40:01.041 --> 01:40:02.531
But you gotta let me in.

01:40:05.111 --> 01:40:07.875
Please. Sam.

01:40:14.254 --> 01:40:15.482
There you are.

01:40:18.658 --> 01:40:21.718
Now I can see those kind eyes.

01:40:23.897 --> 01:40:29.028
So, George says that
you needed a break from work.

01:40:29.069 --> 01:40:32.470
I don't really want
to work there anymore...

01:40:32.505 --> 01:40:34.132
because there's too many people.

01:40:34.174 --> 01:40:41.410
Then maybe we can find you
a quieter job, because--

01:40:41.448 --> 01:40:44.042
Remember that was one of
the judge's conditions...

01:40:44.084 --> 01:40:45.415
that you earn more money.

01:40:45.452 --> 01:40:48.080
You have to keep
earning more money...

01:40:48.121 --> 01:40:49.918
so that you can
get a new apartment...

01:40:49.956 --> 01:40:51.924
and Lucy can have
her own room...

01:40:51.958 --> 01:40:53.550
for when you get her back.

01:40:53.593 --> 01:40:57.791
Yeah, except that
Lucy doesn't need me anymore.

01:40:57.831 --> 01:41:01.927
She has a new family now...

01:41:01.968 --> 01:41:04.266
and she doesn't need me anymore.

01:41:04.304 --> 01:41:05.464
Is that what she said?

01:41:05.505 --> 01:41:08.030
It's because I know that.

01:41:08.074 --> 01:41:10.406
Because I just know that.

01:41:10.443 --> 01:41:12.843
Well.

01:41:12.879 --> 01:41:15.541
That's the first stupid thing
I've ever heard you say.

01:41:18.284 --> 01:41:21.378
Sam, you can get Lucy back.

01:41:21.421 --> 01:41:24.822
The court favors reunification.

01:41:24.858 --> 01:41:28.885
But, Sam,
you have to fight for her.

01:41:28.928 --> 01:41:31.795
Yeah, but I tried!
I tried hard!

01:41:31.831 --> 01:41:35.597
-Try harder!
-Yeah, but you don't know!

01:41:35.635 --> 01:41:36.966
I don't know what?

01:41:37.003 --> 01:41:39.301
You don't know
what it's like when you try...

01:41:39.339 --> 01:41:43.776
and you try and you try
and you don't ever get there!

01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:48.770
Because you were born perfect,
and I was born like this!

01:41:48.815 --> 01:41:50.339
And you're perfect!

01:41:50.383 --> 01:41:51.611
Is that right?

01:41:51.651 --> 01:41:54.279
-People like you don't know.
-People like me?

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:57.153
You don't know what it's like
to get hurted...

01:41:57.190 --> 01:42:00.216
because you don't have feelings.

01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:04.060
People like you
don't feel anything.

01:42:09.369 --> 01:42:13.863
You think you got the market
cornered on human suffering?

01:42:13.907 --> 01:42:16.205
Let me tell you something
about people like me.

01:42:16.242 --> 01:42:23.307
People like me feel lost
and little and ugly...

01:42:23.349 --> 01:42:25.840
and dispensable.

01:42:25.885 --> 01:42:28.752
People like me have husbands...

01:42:28.788 --> 01:42:33.782
screwing someone else
far more perfect than me.

01:42:33.827 --> 01:42:38.526
People like me
have sons who hate them.

01:42:41.935 --> 01:42:46.770
And I've screamed
horrible things to him...

01:42:46.806 --> 01:42:48.740
a seven-year-old,
because he doesn't want...

01:42:48.775 --> 01:42:52.006
to get in the car
at the end of the day.

01:42:52.045 --> 01:42:57.950
And then he looks at me
with such anger...

01:42:57.984 --> 01:43:02.216
and I hate him then.

01:43:02.255 --> 01:43:05.850
I know I'm failing you.
I know I'm disappointing you.

01:43:05.892 --> 01:43:09.419
I know you deserve better,
but get in the fucking car!

01:43:14.534 --> 01:43:20.234
Every morning,
I wake up and I fail.

01:43:20.273 --> 01:43:24.437
And I look around, and everybody
seems to be pulling it off...

01:43:24.477 --> 01:43:28.573
but somehow I can't...

01:43:28.615 --> 01:43:30.674
no matter how hard I try.

01:43:32.986 --> 01:43:37.252
Somehow...l'll never be enough.

01:43:37.290 --> 01:43:38.780
You're enough.

01:43:38.825 --> 01:43:43.660
Yeah, you're much more
than enough.

01:43:43.696 --> 01:43:45.664
Lovely Rita.

01:44:19.065 --> 01:44:20.862
Get off the grass, Dino.

01:44:26.139 --> 01:44:27.834
OK, come on.

01:44:27.874 --> 01:44:31.332
Be careful,
because you're gonna get hurt.

01:44:31.377 --> 01:44:33.811
Guys, be careful
of the pictures.

01:44:33.846 --> 01:44:35.370
Be careful
of the pretty pictures.

01:44:35.415 --> 01:44:36.382
Sam, you're early.

01:44:36.416 --> 01:44:38.646
All the lights were green.

01:44:38.685 --> 01:44:41.620
When I was walking here,
all the lights were green.

01:44:41.654 --> 01:44:43.679
There's a reason
for the court schedule.

01:44:43.723 --> 01:44:45.486
You stopped showing up.

01:44:46.826 --> 01:44:49.522
Lucy's had to rebuild
her whole life, Sam.

01:44:49.562 --> 01:44:52.622
I want her back.
I know I can get her back.

01:44:52.665 --> 01:44:54.929
That's not up to me.

01:44:54.968 --> 01:44:57.436
But I'm just gonna tell you...

01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:59.267
I'm gonna do everything
in my power...

01:44:59.305 --> 01:45:01.899
to protect that little girl
from getting hurt again.

01:45:05.445 --> 01:45:07.879
Whose dogs are these?

01:45:07.914 --> 01:45:10.109
These are supplemental income.

01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:14.950
Because I wash and I walk
and I feed the dogs.

01:45:14.988 --> 01:45:18.583
Sam Dawson has everything
for your canine needs.

01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:22.052
Let me go get your daughter.

01:45:23.229 --> 01:45:25.629
Everybody behave
like a gentleman...

01:45:25.665 --> 01:45:28.361
because Lucy's
gonna come out here...

01:45:28.401 --> 01:45:32.030
and first impressions
are very important.

01:45:35.942 --> 01:45:37.773
You never even came!

01:45:37.810 --> 01:45:40.278
You never called!

01:45:40.313 --> 01:45:43.544
You forgot about me!
How could you forget me?

01:45:43.583 --> 01:45:46.814
No, I didn't forget you!
I would never forget you!

01:45:46.853 --> 01:45:49.083
I hate you!

01:45:49.122 --> 01:45:52.057
Will you not be mad at me
for one second?

01:45:52.091 --> 01:45:55.185
Because I want to
tell you one thing, OK?

01:45:55.228 --> 01:45:59.062
Because last night,
I was writing you a letter...

01:45:59.098 --> 01:46:03.694
and then the words,
they got too big.

01:46:03.736 --> 01:46:06.534
Gesundheit, Floppy.
Floppy has a cold.

01:46:06.572 --> 01:46:08.733
And then I said...

01:46:08.775 --> 01:46:13.371
"Dear Lucy, I'm sorry
I maybe hurt your feelings...

01:46:13.413 --> 01:46:18.146
"and I was thinking
about you all the time.

01:46:18.184 --> 01:46:21.585
"Lucy on a hammock...

01:46:21.621 --> 01:46:23.213
"and Lucy at school...

01:46:23.256 --> 01:46:26.987
"and Lucy in the sky
and kisses and hugs, Daddy.

01:46:27.026 --> 01:46:30.325
"And P.S. I love you,
like the song.

01:46:30.363 --> 01:46:33.730
"P.S. I love you,
like in the song."

01:46:53.252 --> 01:46:55.083
Hello, Mr. Dawson.

01:46:55.121 --> 01:46:58.750
Yeah. Hello, lawyer.

01:47:02.462 --> 01:47:03.429
Shall we?

01:47:03.463 --> 01:47:05.294
And in these next months...

01:47:05.331 --> 01:47:08.494
Mr. Dawson will be expanding
his support system...

01:47:08.534 --> 01:47:12.436
to include regional service
programs, tutors, and--

01:47:12.472 --> 01:47:14.702
I think it's very important
that you know...

01:47:14.741 --> 01:47:19.201
that the foster family is
pushing forward toward adoption.

01:47:19.245 --> 01:47:22.112
The Department of Child
and Family Services and l...

01:47:22.148 --> 01:47:24.378
fully support their request.

01:47:29.989 --> 01:47:32.514
Darn it.

01:47:32.558 --> 01:47:40.294
Sam, there's one option
we've never talked about.

01:47:40.333 --> 01:47:43.393
I know what you went through...

01:47:43.436 --> 01:47:45.927
the last time
you took the stand.

01:47:45.972 --> 01:47:48.532
I didn't like that at all.

01:47:48.574 --> 01:47:53.238
We could give the foster parents
guardianship...

01:47:53.279 --> 01:47:54.906
and then we could try...

01:47:54.947 --> 01:47:57.745
for the most incredible
visitation rights...

01:47:57.784 --> 01:48:01.720
and it would almost seem
like joint custody.

01:48:04.557 --> 01:48:07.185
You're saying
I don't have a chance.

01:48:07.226 --> 01:48:08.488
That's what you're saying.

01:48:08.528 --> 01:48:10.621
No. I'm not saying
you don't have a chance.

01:48:10.663 --> 01:48:15.066
That's what you said last time
and now look where he is.

01:48:15.101 --> 01:48:17.968
But she's not saying
that I don't have a chance.

01:48:18.004 --> 01:48:20.905
So tell me that I have a chance.

01:48:23.676 --> 01:48:25.200
Oh, my God. Sam, you guys...

01:48:25.244 --> 01:48:28.008
it's video night at my house,
and I'm not even there.

01:48:28.047 --> 01:48:31.107
-Check.
-Sam, get your dessert to go.

01:48:31.150 --> 01:48:35.314
Because, OK.

01:48:35.354 --> 01:48:38.152
Wait.
This is really hard to say.

01:48:38.191 --> 01:48:41.183
For me, this is
a very hard thing to say...

01:48:41.227 --> 01:48:44.890
but I'm gonna stay and have
my dessert here with Rita...

01:48:44.931 --> 01:48:48.992
and I'm not gonna go
to video night tonight.

01:48:50.102 --> 01:48:51.262
What?

01:48:51.304 --> 01:48:53.329
Gee, that figures.
I knew that was coming.

01:48:53.372 --> 01:48:55.203
Sam, you can go if you--

01:48:55.241 --> 01:48:57.801
-I said no, Rita.
-But if you want to go--

01:48:57.844 --> 01:48:59.141
Do you want me to go?

01:48:59.178 --> 01:49:02.773
No, I don't want you to go,
but you can go if you want.

01:49:09.155 --> 01:49:11.123
-Fine.
-Fine.

01:49:12.258 --> 01:49:13.850
Good-bye, Rita.

01:49:13.893 --> 01:49:17.886
If you want to come to
video night, you're welcome to.

01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:20.626
Thank you, Joe.

01:49:20.666 --> 01:49:22.293
Bye, Joe.

01:49:29.775 --> 01:49:33.711
Because you're eating slower.
That's good.

01:49:33.746 --> 01:49:37.079
Because it's good to chew.

01:49:37.116 --> 01:49:39.744
Buttermilk pancakes.

01:49:39.785 --> 01:49:43.915
OK. Let me see.

01:49:43.956 --> 01:49:46.982
OK, sidebar.

01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:56.163
Because you--
you need to leave your husband.

01:50:02.108 --> 01:50:05.669
And I need to get Lucy back.

01:50:11.951 --> 01:50:13.441
We need--

01:50:13.486 --> 01:50:18.651
When dealing with the customer,
always be friendly...

01:50:22.161 --> 01:50:24.493
and not familiar.

01:50:28.534 --> 01:50:30.399
Because I can be your friend.

01:50:36.309 --> 01:50:38.174
Thank you.

01:50:40.646 --> 01:50:42.807
But you still need
to leave your husband.

01:50:46.319 --> 01:50:49.413
My marriage isn't so bad.

01:50:53.659 --> 01:50:56.423
It's just that...

01:50:56.462 --> 01:50:57.861
it's just...

01:51:02.134 --> 01:51:04.796
I've never lost at anything.

01:52:04.096 --> 01:52:06.690
-Daddy?
-Hi.

01:52:06.732 --> 01:52:07.699
What are you doing here?

01:52:07.733 --> 01:52:09.701
I live here.

01:52:09.735 --> 01:52:10.759
What do you mean you live here?

01:52:10.803 --> 01:52:12.202
Actually, I live here.

01:52:12.238 --> 01:52:14.433
This is where you live?

01:52:14.473 --> 01:52:16.100
So close to me?

01:52:16.142 --> 01:52:18.736
Yeah, because I wanted
to be close.

01:52:18.778 --> 01:52:21.303
I wanted to be closer to you...

01:52:21.347 --> 01:52:25.408
so I live here
in that apartment.

01:52:25.451 --> 01:52:26.850
It's number nine.

01:52:26.886 --> 01:52:29.150
And number nine
is like October 9...

01:52:29.188 --> 01:52:30.280
when John Lennon was born...

01:52:30.322 --> 01:52:32.847
and his son was born
on October 9, too.

01:52:32.892 --> 01:52:34.757
John met Yoko on November 9.

01:52:34.794 --> 01:52:36.591
Yeah, and his mother lived...

01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:40.725
at number nine Newcastle
in Liverpool.

01:52:40.766 --> 01:52:43.166
Newcastle, nine letters.
Liverpool, nine letters.

01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:48.070
Maybe I can talk to Daddy
for a minute?

01:52:48.107 --> 01:52:49.734
Come over here, Dino.

01:52:49.775 --> 01:52:52.869
You're a Girl Scout now!

01:52:52.912 --> 01:52:54.277
Is that OK?

01:52:54.313 --> 01:52:56.645
Yeah, that's really good.

01:52:56.682 --> 01:52:57.944
Look at my pins.

01:52:57.983 --> 01:53:01.578
-It looks very good on you.
-Thank you.

01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:03.952
You'll be
a very good Girl Scout.

01:53:03.989 --> 01:53:05.752
Sam, we need to talk.

01:53:05.791 --> 01:53:07.315
What are you doing?

01:53:07.359 --> 01:53:09.554
Trying to get closer to her
by moving closer?

01:53:09.595 --> 01:53:11.893
We're supposed
to give her consistency.

01:53:11.931 --> 01:53:13.694
We've got a week
till we go to court.

01:53:17.303 --> 01:53:23.902
Because every time I came down
to see her on a bus...

01:53:23.943 --> 01:53:26.810
I was always every time
wasting time on a bus.

01:53:26.846 --> 01:53:29.178
I really do understand.

01:53:29.215 --> 01:53:32.343
But we have to make it about her
and what's best for her.

01:53:32.384 --> 01:53:34.818
Yeah, what's best for her
is what's most important.

01:53:34.854 --> 01:53:37.288
-Right.
-Yeah.

01:53:37.323 --> 01:53:38.915
Does Floppy still have his cold?

01:53:38.958 --> 01:53:41.984
Yeah, but Floppy's
getting much better.

01:53:42.027 --> 01:53:43.119
That's good.

01:53:43.162 --> 01:53:45.960
Can I buy some cookies from you?

01:53:45.998 --> 01:53:49.490
That'll be 3.25.

01:53:49.535 --> 01:53:50.832
We can get it
from you later.

01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:53.065
We really should get going.

01:53:53.105 --> 01:53:55.335
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

01:53:55.374 --> 01:53:57.740
Can I hug her bye-bye?

01:53:57.776 --> 01:53:59.767
Of course you can hug her.

01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:06.177
Good-bye.

01:54:06.218 --> 01:54:09.585
Really very good to see you.

01:55:11.283 --> 01:55:13.649
Daddy!

01:55:13.686 --> 01:55:15.381
Did you know
that Warren G. Harding...

01:55:15.421 --> 01:55:19.255
was the 29th president
of the United States?

01:55:19.291 --> 01:55:22.158
Remember, the 29th president...

01:55:22.194 --> 01:55:24.685
in case the judge asks.

01:55:24.730 --> 01:55:26.197
What are you doing out here?

01:55:26.232 --> 01:55:27.563
I missed you.

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:30.364
You could get really hurted.

01:55:30.402 --> 01:55:31.699
And it's really cold...

01:55:31.737 --> 01:55:34.706
and you don't have enough on
to keep you warm.

01:55:35.908 --> 01:55:37.398
What--?

01:55:37.443 --> 01:55:41.607
She couldn't sleep,
so she came to my house.

01:55:41.647 --> 01:55:44.844
Give me my daughter.
Give us Lucy. Come here.

01:55:44.883 --> 01:55:48.011
Easy, Sam.
Thank you.

01:55:48.053 --> 01:55:50.521
Sometimes
if you rub her belly...

01:55:50.556 --> 01:55:53.184
and then if you
tell her two stories...

01:55:53.225 --> 01:55:56.922
and give her half
an IHOP corn muffin...

01:55:56.962 --> 01:55:58.896
then sometimes she sleeps.

01:55:58.931 --> 01:56:00.592
When she can't sleep.

01:56:00.633 --> 01:56:04.194
We'll be fine, Sam.
Good night.

01:56:04.236 --> 01:56:06.295
Good night.

01:56:06.338 --> 01:56:08.806
You can go home now.

01:56:29.261 --> 01:56:32.094
Yeah, a personal
pepperoni pan pizza.

01:56:32.131 --> 01:56:33.894
That's a wonderful choice.

01:56:48.714 --> 01:56:50.375
Daddy?

01:56:53.152 --> 01:56:54.380
Daddy?

01:57:21.347 --> 01:57:23.076
Lucy, come here.

01:57:26.652 --> 01:57:28.517
Hi, sweetie.

01:57:28.554 --> 01:57:30.954
I made us a midnight snack.

01:57:30.989 --> 01:57:32.980
Half an IHOP corn cake.

01:57:35.527 --> 01:57:37.995
I understand that
you want to see your daddy.

01:57:40.399 --> 01:57:43.163
And I really don't want
to keep you from him.

01:57:43.202 --> 01:57:45.466
I really honestly don't.

01:57:45.504 --> 01:57:48.132
I want you to know that.

01:57:48.173 --> 01:57:50.232
So whenever you want
to see him, you just tell me.

01:57:50.275 --> 01:57:54.177
Any time you want
to see him is fine...

01:57:54.213 --> 01:57:57.808
but we kind of need
to work it out first.

01:57:57.850 --> 01:57:59.215
So how about a snack?

01:58:06.892 --> 01:58:08.257
Thank you.

01:58:08.293 --> 01:58:09.658
Good night.

01:58:09.695 --> 01:58:11.287
Good night.

01:58:22.307 --> 01:58:25.174
Everybody behave yourself.

01:58:28.347 --> 01:58:30.212
Oh, how wonderful.
You brought Willy.

01:58:30.249 --> 01:58:32.911
-Hi, Willy.
-Hi, Sam.

01:58:32.951 --> 01:58:34.418
It's good to see you.

01:58:35.654 --> 01:58:38.953
We have to close the door
because the dogs go out.

01:58:46.064 --> 01:58:48.931
My husband left this
when he moved out.

01:58:51.069 --> 01:58:53.594
Lovely Rita.

01:58:53.639 --> 01:58:57.769
OK, let me see.

01:58:57.810 --> 01:59:02.440
They're going to put Randy
on the stand tomorrow first...

01:59:02.481 --> 01:59:04.449
and then you.

01:59:06.552 --> 01:59:09.146
They're a very nice couple.

01:59:09.188 --> 01:59:12.123
And she's pretty,
and they have a nice house...

01:59:12.157 --> 01:59:14.148
and she's smart, too.

01:59:14.193 --> 01:59:18.391
Sam, I worry.
I worry sometimes.

01:59:20.833 --> 01:59:24.234
Do you worry
that you did something wrong?

01:59:31.777 --> 01:59:33.074
I worry that I've gotten...

01:59:33.111 --> 01:59:35.602
more out of this relationship
than you.

01:59:49.228 --> 01:59:54.996
I have the lawyer
that never loses.

01:59:55.033 --> 01:59:57.661
That's me.

02:00:00.272 --> 02:00:04.231
And the manager at
the Pizza Hut's gonna testify...

02:00:04.276 --> 02:00:05.607
and that's good.

02:00:05.644 --> 02:00:07.111
Absolutely.

02:00:10.249 --> 02:00:16.711
And Annie said
that George thinks--

02:00:16.755 --> 02:00:18.382
that George Harrison
couldn't--

02:00:18.423 --> 02:00:22.325
maybe, he couldn't
write a song...

02:00:22.361 --> 02:00:26.263
but then he wrote
"Here Comes the Sun"...

02:00:26.298 --> 02:00:34.103
and she said that it was one of
the best songs on "Abbey Road."

02:00:36.942 --> 02:00:39.843
George was always
my favorite Beatle.

02:01:02.334 --> 02:01:05.633
She's OK. Sorry.

02:01:05.671 --> 02:01:07.263
She fell asleep in the car.

02:01:08.874 --> 02:01:17.111
I was gonna turn back
and tuck her in...in her room.

02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:21.313
You know, that l--
in her room that I made for her.

02:01:23.455 --> 02:01:26.686
Because I tried to make
a really nice room for her.

02:01:26.725 --> 02:01:29.023
But I was afraid
she'd wake up at our house...

02:01:31.063 --> 02:01:33.588
and want to come home.

02:01:36.568 --> 02:01:38.001
That's a girl.

02:01:47.412 --> 02:01:51.280
I have to apologize to you...

02:01:51.316 --> 02:01:55.275
because I was gonna
tell that judge...

02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:59.780
that I could give Lucy
the kind of love she never had.

02:01:59.825 --> 02:02:03.989
But I can't say that,
because I'd be lying.

02:02:05.497 --> 02:02:07.795
I hope...

02:02:07.833 --> 02:02:12.930
I hope you're saying
what I think you're saying.

02:02:12.971 --> 02:02:16.065
I hope you're saying
what I think you're saying.

02:02:17.476 --> 02:02:18.773
I am.

02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:24.011
Bye.

02:02:26.118 --> 02:02:27.915
I'll see you in court tomorrow.

02:02:29.855 --> 02:02:31.880
Save me a seat, Sam.

02:02:31.923 --> 02:02:34.824
On your side. OK?

02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:39.763
Yeah. I'll save you a seat
on my side.

02:02:39.798 --> 02:02:41.993
-Bye.
-Bye.

02:02:43.802 --> 02:02:46.430
Randy?

02:02:46.471 --> 02:02:49.065
If I tell you a secret...

02:02:49.107 --> 02:02:52.907
that I can't do it by myself...

02:02:52.944 --> 02:02:54.673
will you tell the judge on me?

02:02:56.415 --> 02:02:57.609
No, Sam.

02:02:59.151 --> 02:03:00.846
Promise?

02:03:00.886 --> 02:03:02.444
I promise.

02:03:04.923 --> 02:03:10.452
Because I always wanted
Lucy to have a mother.

02:03:10.495 --> 02:03:12.793
I always wanted her
to have a mother.

02:03:12.831 --> 02:03:16.323
Help. I need somebody.

02:03:16.368 --> 02:03:20.668
Help. Not just anyone.

02:03:23.909 --> 02:03:27.845
And you're the red
in her painting.

02:03:27.879 --> 02:03:31.178
Because I think
you're the red in her painting.

02:03:40.092 --> 02:03:41.650
Thank you, Sam.

02:04:07.986 --> 02:04:09.510
Play ball!

02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:13.621
Get it, Lucy!

02:04:19.131 --> 02:04:20.462
Go, Lucy!

02:04:32.811 --> 02:04:34.574
Lucy got a goal!

02:04:39.117 --> 02:04:41.585
Lucy got a goal, Rita!
