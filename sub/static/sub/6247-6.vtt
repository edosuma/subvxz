WEBVTT

00:03.560 --> 00:06.791
Come on, honey. If we don't
leave, we won't get into the club.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.519
- I'm just finishing up a few emails.
- Oh, what?

00:09.600 --> 00:14.310
- My publisher wants to schedule a book tour.
- That can wait, sweetie.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.632
A student needs help with the cause
of a fracture on a lateraI epicondyle.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.156
- TGIF. You heard of that?
- Yeah. It's some kind of acronym.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.470
- But my inbox is full.
- That's not true.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.870
There's a TV show that needs
research. Not that they listen.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.520
- We're going.
- I should catalogue that skull.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.273
It's in the exhibit on
the French Revolution.

00:33.360 --> 00:37.592
Yeah. Pepé Le Pew is more
important than booze... and boys.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.591
I don't think that's his name.

00:43.520 --> 00:46.876
<i>All right, everybody.
Keep it crunking here.</i>

00:46.960 --> 00:51.795
<i>Tonight the Basement Club brings to you
the number one DJ around town: DJ Rulz!</i>

00:51.880 --> 00:54.440
<i>Give it up!</i>

00:54.520 --> 00:57.592
Feels good, doesn't it? Being
with people who are alive?

00:57.680 --> 01:01.468
- It's stimulating, I have to admit.
- We are so gonna tear it up tonight.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.357
- That's slang, right?
- Right.

01:03.440 --> 01:08.309
- Is my costume all right?
- It's not a costume, it's an outfit. Yes, perfect.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.595
I know, it's very warm in here.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.875
No, because it looks great.

01:13.520 --> 01:16.830
- We are so getting checked out.
- I love this music.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.832
<i>DJ Rulz
- he is so hot.</i>

01:24.120 --> 01:26.554
- It's so tribaI.
- Don't say tribaI, sweetie.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.473
Why? Oh, because of
all the black people?

01:29.560 --> 01:32.154
Sweetie, have fun. Stop
dissecting, take part.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.710
African-Americans aren't the
only ones with tribaI heritage.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.998
- You saying we're natives of some tribe?
- Anthropologically speaking, we all are.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.672
You better shut your mouth.

01:41.760 --> 01:46.709
I just meant hip-hop mirrors the visceraI
connection you see in tribaI communication.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.028
- Oh, man!
- What?!

01:48.120 --> 01:52.477
After the Cartesian split, we
separated our minds from our bodies.

01:52.560 --> 01:57.156
- The numinous from the animalistic.
- Are you calling me an animaI, fooI?

01:57.240 --> 02:00.994
No, fooI. She's using Descartes'
philosophy to say she's down with the music.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.230
Who you calling a fooI, fooI?

02:03.320 --> 02:04.992
Get out my way.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.628
- We're going. We're going.
- You shouldn't have done that, bitch!

<i>- That's what I'm
talking about. - Uh-oh.</i>

02:24.000 --> 02:27.549
<i>- Yo, check this out.
- Look in the wall. What is that?</i>

02:27.640 --> 02:30.154
<i>Look at that fooI, man.</i>

02:33.080 --> 02:36.755
- Can she handle this?
- No one in our lab can deaI with a mummy.

02:36.840 --> 02:40.628
- I'd have to call her in anyway.
- She assaulted two agents.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.676
They were compromising the remains.

02:42.760 --> 02:46.753
A cloud of meth covered the dance floor.
I think they've inhaled quite a lot.

02:46.840 --> 02:49.354
- You two high?
- By accident. It doesn't count.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.829
Why bring Tessa? This
isn't a great date.

02:51.920 --> 02:56.277
We were out to dinner when he got your
call. Your pupils are the size of saucers.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.238
- Get away from the remains!
- Bones, simmer down.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.880
- How long is this gonna take?
- Who wants to know?

03:01.960 --> 03:04.713
He works for me. I'm Randall
Hall. I run this place.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.395
You run this place? Interesting,
cos we found some drugs on this...

03:08.480 --> 03:11.677
- Found them. We found them.
- We found drugs on the dead guy.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.194
- We wanna know where they're from...
- Why...

03:14.280 --> 03:18.273
- .. why he had them. Any idea who he is?
- Why he had them.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.920
- Any idea?
- Guy barely looks human.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.389
What makes you think I'd recognise him?

03:23.480 --> 03:26.153
Bones? Bones, how does
something like this happen?

03:26.240 --> 03:30.438
The Egyptians would give the body a
cedar-oiI enema and cover it with salt.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.988
- That didn't happen here.
- You are wasted.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.469
Zack! Zack! Zack!

03:35.560 --> 03:40.315
Come here! Come here! Isn't this a
beautifuI specimen of mummification?

03:40.400 --> 03:42.709
- What's going on?
- Your boss inhaled.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.793
See how preserved the skin is? You
don't find something like this every day.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.075
Hey, Tessa, have you seen it?

03:49.160 --> 03:52.835
It's hard to believe you two'd be a couple
- cop and lawyer. Touching.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.117
- I'm gonna grab a cab.
- Oh, no. OK, hold up.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.953
Sorry. Sorry. I apologise.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.113
Here. I'm gonna make it up to you.
I promise. OK? Ice cream later?

04:03.200 --> 04:06.192
- Take care.
- I'll talk to you later.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.839
<i>Awwwww...</i>

04:08.920 --> 04:10.911
Can we just stick to business?

04:11.000 --> 04:16.358
I'm gonna need a list of your employees. We'll
run it and see if any have a drug conviction.

04:16.440 --> 04:21.639
- How long before you can ID him?
- I'm not tired. I'll stay up all night and work.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.076
We have to be carefuI removing
him. He's very dry and brittle.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.153
My first modern mummy.

05:06.040 --> 05:10.033
CrystaI meth is made from cold medicine,
Iye and strike pads from matchbooks.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.430
- The body was not designed to deaI with it.
- So I'm finding out.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.398
- Camomile tea?
- No. I just need your results.

05:16.480 --> 05:20.712
- A stick to pry the monkey off your back?
- Are you sure you need me here?

05:20.800 --> 05:22.836
Payback for showing me the good life.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.799
- OK. So how is my man, the Tut?
- In better shape than I am.

05:26.880 --> 05:31.795
The meth in his lungs and nose matches the
meth thatjuiced Angela and the good doctor.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.871
Can you please keep it clinicaI?

05:33.960 --> 05:36.679
So, uh, he died of an overdose.

05:38.280 --> 05:43.593
Asphyxiation. Meth coated the alveoli in
his lungs, making breathing impossible.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.877
So he overdosed with
his meth behind the wall.

05:46.960 --> 05:50.635
The space was too narrow to squeeze
through. He got stuck, bag broke.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.314
When he gasped for air
he died instantaneously.

05:53.400 --> 05:57.791
The dry-air convection behind the wall
removed most of the moisture from his body.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.472
How long was he in there?

05:59.560 --> 06:02.791
Judging from the acrid mites
in his ears, I'd say six weeks.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.235
Hey, didn't he have hands?

06:06.480 --> 06:12.669
They're easier to work with dismembered. I've
rehydrated them so we can get fingerprints.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.795
- Off that?
- Sure.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.828
- You ever been to Costa Rica?
- I was flown down once.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.913
They found a human
skull, 12,000 years old.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.234
- Why?
- I get some vacation time.

06:31.320 --> 06:34.596
I was gonna head off on Thursday.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.791
- I heard Costa Rica was beautifuI.
- Mm.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.997
Fascinating wildIife. Lots of parrots.

06:42.080 --> 06:47.598
Oh, I don't like parrots. No. People
should really... really do all talking.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.272
You know, maybe I should...

06:49.360 --> 06:51.191
Oh, God! What are you doing?

06:51.280 --> 06:56.798
The Aztecs would flay people and
then... wear their skin as a bodysuit.

06:57.800 --> 07:02.874
I guess you won't be needing
mittens for Christmas, huh?

07:06.640 --> 07:09.916
- Did the FBI find a match?
- Yep. His name was Roy Taylor.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.232
Roy Taylor? You're
kidding? That's DJ Mount.

07:14.320 --> 07:18.074
- I don't know who that is.
- Mount is one of the best DJs in DC.

07:18.160 --> 07:22.915
He used to play at the club. Everyone
was wondering what happened to him.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.991
His album'll take off after this.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.717
- I never knew this side of you, Bones.
- It's DJ Mount.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.791
Doesn't this make your head explode?

07:35.880 --> 07:41.238
I got a couple hours of sleep on my couch
and showered in the decontamination room.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.719
Really know how to live.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.475
Angela said rap artists sometimes
kill each other over the music.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.870
Jam Master J, Tupac, Biggie.

07:49.960 --> 07:54.750
- D'you even know who you're talking about?
- Yeah. I've done my Googling.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.115
Listen.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.112
You can hear the alpha
male asserting himself.

08:01.560 --> 08:05.792
<i>"Fill your ass up... .. with
lead. " Always a nice Iyric.</i>

08:05.880 --> 08:11.034
I'm heading back to the club
to meet the FBI forensics team.

08:11.120 --> 08:14.032
<i>I'm getting facts.</i>

08:14.120 --> 08:17.396
<i>DJ Mount. He was starting to break,</i>

08:18.120 --> 08:20.554
finally making some money.

08:20.640 --> 08:24.155
Someone who's never had
anything, it can go to your head.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.435
So he gets involved with drugs.

08:26.520 --> 08:31.150
You didn't know who he was hanging
with or who might've been chasing him?

08:31.680 --> 08:36.629
Dude like Mount, he had a lot of enemies
- other artists, rivalries.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.711
Everyone wants to be number one.

08:38.799 --> 08:43.078
I mean, you have to know
who the rivals are, Mr Hall.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.196
Affects your bottom line.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.874
Wait for me by the elevator.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.790
- Rulz.
- What rules?

08:58.880 --> 09:02.759
That's his name. He
performs at the club.

09:04.840 --> 09:11.439
I try to keep my crew together, but I always
had to run interference between those two.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.830
- Why?
- Ask Rulz.

09:21.240 --> 09:25.711
<i>- Was it fun coming to the club?
- Yeah. Before the drugs and the dead body.</i>

09:25.800 --> 09:27.597
Tilt... tilt down.

09:28.560 --> 09:33.315
Seems so primitive
- being in a crowd of strangers, gyrating to music.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.154
- You've never danced?
- I'm told I look like a marionette in a storm.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.277
- You would've fit right in last night.
- Really?

09:41.240 --> 09:44.755
<i>Footprints... in the dirt
and the termite shavings.</i>

09:44.840 --> 09:49.675
- Someone was on the other side of him.
- Light. This leads to the outside.

09:49.760 --> 09:53.594
- We need to get inside that wall.
- Or take it down.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.671
One last look?

09:57.800 --> 09:59.791
Take 'em in, show 'em around.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.955
- Agent Booth?
- Yeah?

10:07.640 --> 10:11.394
I'm Roy Taylor's father.
Maybe you know him as DJ Mount.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.790
- Mr Taylor, please come in.
- Thank you for seeing me.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.757
Please sit.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.274
You the one looking
into my son's murder?

10:21.360 --> 10:26.354
Investigating his death, yes,
sir. I'm... sorry for your loss.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.591
- I have some information you need.
- About your son's death?

10:30.680 --> 10:32.671
No, sir.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.189
About his life.

10:36.280 --> 10:39.750
I've read in the newspaper how
my son was part of the meth scene,

10:39.840 --> 10:44.152
how he was killed by drugs
behind a wall like that.

10:48.520 --> 10:54.595
What my son did was graduate third
in his class from high schooI.

10:55.080 --> 11:00.393
He would've graduated first, except
he... he worked a full-time job.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.192
Track-and-field
medals,

11:05.280 --> 11:07.635
baseball.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.349
Roy never drank and he never did drugs.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.670
- Do you understand me, sir?
- Mr Taylor...

11:13.760 --> 11:17.594
How they are portraying my
boy in the newspapers is wrong.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.353
If his mother was
alive, it would kill her.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.549
I taught him a relationship with Jesus.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.154
Do you understand, sir?

11:28.240 --> 11:31.118
A personaI relationship with Jesus.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.829
With all due respect, sir, sometimes
when kids grow up they change,

11:34.920 --> 11:38.390
they move away from
what they were taught.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.074
Five years old, he made this.

11:47.920 --> 11:52.038
And a lady who reads palms,

11:52.120 --> 11:54.714
she looked at it and she said...

11:55.840 --> 11:59.435
She said my boy was
going to be a great man...

12:01.440 --> 12:03.635
a good man.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.509
She read no eviI in that boy's hand.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.517
I can see that now, sir.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.554
Some iniquity killed my boy.

12:34.360 --> 12:38.717
Do you know that word, Agent
Booth? It's from the Bible.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.793
"Deliver me from the
workers of iniquity...

12:46.280 --> 12:48.953
and save me from bloody men. "

12:54.200 --> 12:56.589
You know your Psalms, sir.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.229
I can trust that you will find
out what happened to my boy?

13:08.320 --> 13:10.151
Yes, sir.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.597
Good.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.389
Then I'm glad I came by.

13:25.320 --> 13:28.198
<i>Can we conform to as
much protocoI as possible?</i>

13:28.280 --> 13:31.909
<i>We're better at this than you think.</i>

13:33.520 --> 13:35.715
<i>- You know what those are?
- Rats.</i>

13:35.800 --> 13:40.157
Scaring us with rats? We've been to places
where rats eat the laces out of our boots.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.595
Take it easy there, Willard.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.955
<i>There are the footprints.</i>

13:47.040 --> 13:49.873
There are marks on
the wall. It's scraped.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.520
<i>Blood smear. Dried.</i>

14:04.240 --> 14:06.071
I see something.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.991
Can I retrieve?

14:08.080 --> 14:09.877
Yes.

14:21.440 --> 14:25.797
Apparently there's a
rivalry between Mount

14:25.880 --> 14:28.952
and this guy... Rulz.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.713
We saw him perform last
night. Did you talk to him?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.995
Oh, no. I don't have enough yet.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.116
I go in too soon, he could run.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.237
Wow, that's a beautifuI
piece. Zirconium or diamond?

14:39.320 --> 14:42.790
I'm more focused on the dried
blood and flesh at the moment.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.873
- Do you buy Tessajewellery?
- I don't wanna talk about that right now.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.873
Too much of a commitment. I just thought
because you two were going away...

14:50.960 --> 14:54.714
- Do you have anything yet?
- Given the rate of air convection

14:54.800 --> 14:59.510
and the degree of dehydration of the flesh,
I'd say they were there at the same time.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.956
Must hurt to get that thing
ripped out of your bellybutton.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.077
- I thought it was an earring.
- Look at the size of the stud.

15:06.160 --> 15:10.870
I had one of these before they
became totally Miami divorcée.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.396
Good news. I was able to
pull some particulates.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.392
- Are... are those...?
- Eyeballs? Yeah.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.671
Two foreign materials -

15:19.760 --> 15:23.309
low density polyethylene residue
and methamphetamine crystals.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.278
- Polyethylene?
- From the plastic bag holding the meth.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.954
This can be cleaned now.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.836
Yeah, that's a reaI diamond.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.913
Hey, why not get her a bellybutton ring?
That's not too much of a commitment.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.437
The inside of the lips was damaged by the
teeth. It was not an accidentaI inhalation.

15:41.520 --> 15:46.389
The meth was pushed against his face with
force. Someone was trying to smother him.

15:46.480 --> 15:51.235
- That's how the particulates got into the eye.
- So he didn't OD. He was murdered.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.949
So we just have to find out
who owns this bellybutton ring.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.998
<i>Look at this. "Luv Rulz. "</i>

16:00.440 --> 16:03.238
At least we know who to ask.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.519
Hello.

16:11.600 --> 16:15.070
- Yeah. It's open.
- Yeah, it's open. FBI SpeciaI Agent Booth.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.596
<i>What? Is the FBI recruiting
from America's Top Model now?</i>

16:18.680 --> 16:20.910
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.753
- She works for the FBI.
- I could live with that.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.832
Dr Brennan also discovered
that Roy Taylor was murdered.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.309
- So?
- So, murder is wack, see?

16:29.400 --> 16:32.039
Cos those are the rules, Rulz.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.076
Maybe he had it coming to him.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.550
Oh, so you and Roy
Taylor don't get along.

16:37.640 --> 16:42.156
That sucker ran me down, man. Tried to slam
me in one of his tracks. Ain't nobody do that.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.437
And, uh, what happens when they do?

16:45.520 --> 16:48.080
I take a piece of 'em.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.833
I saw him at the Basement,
told him to disappear

16:50.920 --> 16:55.198
<i>and I ain't seen him since
cos he knew to follow the Rulz.</i>

16:56.760 --> 17:03.233
And maybe your girlfriend made sure
that your "problem" just went away.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.637
She ain't my woman. I kicked
her sorry ass out months ago.

17:06.720 --> 17:10.109
- What is her sorry-ass
name? - Eve Warren.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.954
- What was she doing with Mount?
- Take a guess. I guess it was his turn.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.396
- She kept your ring?
- It's a diamond. Why'd she get rid of that?

17:17.480 --> 17:21.678
- Any idea where she is now?
- Probably ripping somebody else off.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.275
That girI don't care about
nobody but herself. She got a kid.

17:25.359 --> 17:29.433
Don't care about her neither. Let
her brother shoulder that. Bitch.

17:29.520 --> 17:33.672
- What happened to your hand?
- I got shot through the wrist a few years ago.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.955
Shattered the lower radius.

17:36.040 --> 17:40.477
- Yeah. I got some nerve damage, too.
- It's impressive.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.757
I got shot in the back and
leg, too. Wanna see the scars?

17:43.840 --> 17:47.435
Thanks anyway. Let us
know if you hear from Eve.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.349
That's all I got for y'all. I
wanna get back to work. That's it.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.318
You let us know if you hear from her.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.069
<i>Bones?</i>

18:01.800 --> 18:03.791
I like this music.

18:06.160 --> 18:10.199
<i>OK. DJ Mount trusted Eve because
they were sleeping together.</i>

18:10.280 --> 18:13.113
She meets him in the
wall, takes the drugs,

18:13.200 --> 18:15.839
kills him for Rulz, then he takes off.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.753
- Hey, you should write fiction.
- It's reasonable.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.956
It's not based on evidence.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.838
I'm positing a scenario.
We've been through this.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.833
And it always seems to be a waste of
time. Now, finding a marker on a bone...

18:27.920 --> 18:31.037
No. I think I need a
vacation. I think you do, too.

18:31.120 --> 18:35.716
- Well, I'm not the one who's snippy.
- "Snippy"? What are you? Like, 70?

18:35.800 --> 18:40.669
See what I mean? I think you should find a
nice, relaxing place to go on that vacation.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.558
Somewhere where you can
get a massage, do some yoga.

18:43.640 --> 18:48.794
- I don't do yoga. I do push-ups, sit-ups.
- That's cardiovascular. Yoga deals more...

18:48.880 --> 18:52.270
- Why exactly are we talking about this?
- Because you're tense.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.829
You switched my music?

19:06.520 --> 19:09.114
- Roy Taylor?
- Yes.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.714
Anything pop out now
the bones are clean?

19:11.800 --> 19:15.952
Some damage to the facetjoint and foramen
on C4 on the right side of the neck.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.429
That suggests his head
was forced that way.

19:18.520 --> 19:21.671
One other thing. I looked at
the skull through the microscope.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.639
Came across a slight
depression, barely discernable.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.950
A slight indentation.

19:28.040 --> 19:33.114
- Could it be congenitaI? Or a bone anomaly?
- Yeah, probably.

19:35.640 --> 19:40.191
- Do you ever go on vacation?
- I take my vacation when you take yours.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.910
- What do you do?
- Go back home to Michigan, see the family.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.309
I have three brothers and four sisters.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.228
- Do you enjoy that?
- God, no.

19:50.320 --> 19:54.393
I made the mistake of telling them
I work with corpses and skeletons.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.358
- They think I'm a freak.
- Then why do you go?

19:57.440 --> 19:59.431
It's my family.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.239
They love me.

20:02.320 --> 20:08.316
Take a closer look at the anomaly under
the microscope. See what made that mark.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.754
Yeah, let's work. Let's work!

20:19.360 --> 20:21.954
- What do you want?
- SpeciaI Agent Booth, FBI.

20:22.040 --> 20:25.271
- This is my associate, Dr Brennan.
- What do you call this?

20:25.360 --> 20:27.476
Krump.

20:27.560 --> 20:31.758
The kids, they come here, they
dance, they don't gangbang.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.957
So what do you want? You didn't
come here for a dance lesson.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.790
Hey, Maya. How you doin', baby?

20:39.760 --> 20:44.914
Come on now. We're gonna go outside and you
gonna play with the rest of the kids, OK?

20:45.000 --> 20:49.039
- There you go.
- I'd like to ask you about your sister Eve.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.474
- What's she done now?
- When was the last time you saw her?

20:54.560 --> 20:57.472
About six weeks ago when
she dropped off Maya.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.313
- OK. That's fine.
- Just dropped her off and left?

21:00.400 --> 21:03.392
She needed me to watch her for
a while. Left me some money.

21:03.480 --> 21:09.669
Do you happen to have a, I don't
know, recent photo that we could take?

21:10.760 --> 21:16.312
Evie said she had cleaned herself
up. She was turning her life around.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.960
And I believed her.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.918
She never came back.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.711
That little girI out
there, that's her daughter.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.233
She's like a daughter to me, too.

21:30.240 --> 21:35.109
Didn't it bother you that Eve never came
back? I mean, didn't you go look for her?

21:35.200 --> 21:36.997
I learned to let her go.

21:37.560 --> 21:41.633
Eve, she's had a lot of problems
- drugs, hanging out with the wrong people.

21:41.720 --> 21:45.759
If I track her down and she
takes Maya before she's ready...

21:45.840 --> 21:49.116
I'm not letting nothing
happen to that little girI.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.913
- Did you know Roy Taylor?
- Met him.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.958
DJ Mount. I like his
stuff. Play it for the kids.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.395
We think she was there
when he was murdered.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.710
Murdered?

22:01.200 --> 22:03.760
- You can't find Evie?
- No.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.439
Oh, man.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.114
She told me she loved him...

22:12.080 --> 22:16.437
and that she and Mount were
gonna take Maya away, out of DC,

22:16.520 --> 22:18.909
give her a better
life, one we never had.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.039
- You said she left you some cash.
- Yeah. For Maya.

22:23.120 --> 22:26.590
I'll buy what you have,
two dollars to one.

22:26.680 --> 22:29.877
<i>Sure. Whatever, man.</i>

22:34.880 --> 22:39.749
You may want the stooges at the FBI, who
are experts due to your so-called "drug war",

22:39.840 --> 22:45.551
to run a comparison, but I'd say the meth on
these bills matches that found with DJ Mount.

22:45.640 --> 22:50.953
Yeah. My guess is that Eve was with
Mount at the time that he was murdered.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.508
How about this, huh?

22:53.600 --> 22:57.513
DJ Mount rejects Eve because
of a questionable past.

22:57.600 --> 23:01.957
So, hey, she gets mad, she wants
to leave with some money, so...

23:03.960 --> 23:06.838
- What?
- Yeah, I don't really think about that stuff.

23:06.920 --> 23:11.198
- I'm more about bugs and minerals. Sorry.
- Come on, Hodgins. You're a smart guy.

23:11.280 --> 23:16.638
Look up from your microscope. These are
reaI people we're trying to figure out here.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.594
- OK.
- Maybe she was just using Mount.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.353
- Setting him up to get his drugs and money.
- Nice.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.715
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:25.800 --> 23:29.395
- ReaI question is where does she go next?
- You're on fire, man.

23:29.480 --> 23:33.473
After she left her brother's place.
That is where she met her untimely end.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.199
I'm gonna turn you into
an investigator yet.

23:36.280 --> 23:40.114
No, no, no. Bugs and slime,
dude. That is where I'm happy.

23:50.160 --> 23:54.631
The damage to his C4 vertebra was the result
of his head being twisted so far right.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.518
He was moving this way, toward Eve.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.319
<i>My bet is he was chasing her.</i>

24:00.400 --> 24:03.995
- And that's based on?
- Money and meth.

24:04.080 --> 24:07.993
She left carrying money saturated
in the same meth that killed Mount.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.629
- She was moving fast.
- She didn't stop when her ring got ripped out.

24:11.720 --> 24:17.636
Money's a good reason to get chased, hm?
Only question is why wasn't he facing her?

24:17.720 --> 24:21.679
It got tight back there. 15 centimetres.

24:21.760 --> 24:25.514
Eve ripped out her bellybutton ring
here and then left a smear of blood

24:25.600 --> 24:28.034
untiI the corridor widened, here.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.951
Oh, God!

24:32.560 --> 24:36.678
- What?
- Thatjust... makes me a little sick.

24:36.760 --> 24:40.833
You pick bodies out of graves. Yanking
out a bellybutton ring makes you sick?

24:40.920 --> 24:42.512
OK. Move along.

24:42.600 --> 24:47.037
I've shot a lot of people, and I admit that
bellybutton thing makes me nauseous, too.

24:47.120 --> 24:51.511
- Thank you.
- Mount must've looked back, but kept going.

24:51.600 --> 24:56.435
Then the passageway narrowed, so he
couldn't turn his head back toward Eve.

24:56.520 --> 25:01.230
Then there's no way she could've shoved
the meth into his face. Eve didn't kill him.

25:01.320 --> 25:03.595
A third person surprised him. He turned.

25:03.680 --> 25:07.355
Mount prevented this third person
getting to Eve, so she escaped.

25:07.440 --> 25:11.069
But he got to Mount, shoved the
meth in his face and killed him.

25:11.520 --> 25:16.878
But the reaI question is who
the hell is this third person?

25:24.000 --> 25:28.915
<i>- Why the hell you pick me up, man?
- You know why I brought you in.</i>

25:29.000 --> 25:33.312
I waited for you to contact me, explain
your situation, but you didn't do that.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.436
That's not polite.

25:35.520 --> 25:39.559
What are you? DEA? Metro cop?

25:40.400 --> 25:43.153
I'm SpeciaI Agent Ronald Oakes.

25:43.240 --> 25:47.279
- One of us?
- My orders were not to break deep cover.

25:47.360 --> 25:51.069
Out of deep regard for my FBI
brother, I gave you the nod.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.911
That's bull.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.670
I made you. Now you're making excuses.

26:00.240 --> 26:02.231
You got any keys for these cuffs?

26:02.320 --> 26:04.595
Fine. Your way.

26:05.600 --> 26:10.151
I need more than a nod, man. You know,
I'm conducting a murder investigation.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.834
Now I need to know what you know.

26:13.760 --> 26:19.835
15 months investigating the links between
the urban music business and gang activity.

26:19.920 --> 26:23.515
- That's why you got next to Hall.
- That's a clean alias. You ran him?

26:23.600 --> 26:25.716
- Yeah.
- Came back clean?

26:25.800 --> 26:28.997
His reaI name is Terrance Baskin.

26:29.480 --> 26:34.713
We know he's pushing meth through that
club, but we can't get enough to touch him.

26:34.800 --> 26:38.634
Our informants disappear. They
either get bought off or killed.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.837
- What about this murder?
- The night Mount disappeared,

26:41.920 --> 26:44.434
Hall got ripped off for
meth and a ton of cash.

26:44.520 --> 26:49.355
- DJ Mount ripped off Hall?
- No. It doesn't scan. Mount was into Jesus.

26:49.440 --> 26:54.833
- Hall killed DJ Mount?
- Nah. Hall's people do that stuff for him.

26:55.760 --> 26:59.639
So if anybody asked, why
did you have me arrested?

26:59.720 --> 27:01.472
Weapons beef.

27:03.120 --> 27:06.874
<i>- So I don't get my gun back?
- No. No.</i>

27:07.920 --> 27:12.596
We meet up again, if you
get an excuse, hit me.

27:12.680 --> 27:15.478
Oh. That, uh...

27:15.560 --> 27:17.915
Count on it.

27:20.560 --> 27:25.315
I've been investigated for years. Why do
you think they never got me on anything?

27:25.400 --> 27:27.789
Because you're so smart?

27:28.640 --> 27:31.791
Because Terrance Baskin is my past.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.394
I am 100% clean now.

27:35.480 --> 27:39.439
This is my life now.
This and my record labeI.

27:39.520 --> 27:42.751
Not crystaI meth, not gangbanging.

27:42.840 --> 27:48.233
Yet much of the iconic quality of urban
music lies in the perceived or actuaI rivalry

27:48.320 --> 27:50.834
between the principaI artists.

27:52.160 --> 27:55.118
- Where did you find her?
- Museum.

27:56.440 --> 28:01.753
Was the rivalry between Mount and Mr
Rulz strong enough to lead to murder?

28:01.840 --> 28:03.432
Sure. They were both capable.

28:03.520 --> 28:07.513
Add in the fact that Mount was
sleeping with Rulz's girlfriend, Eve.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.955
- Yeah, in fact...
- Yeah?

28:10.040 --> 28:13.350
.. Rulz built himself a
studio around that time.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.318
Poured cement for the pad a
day after they disappeared.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.391
- So?
- I'm saying...

28:18.480 --> 28:22.075
Mount's dead, Eve's gone missing.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.154
You might want to consider that.

28:27.120 --> 28:31.079
- Let's go.
- What do you think?

28:31.160 --> 28:34.675
What do I think? I think
we need to find a way

28:34.760 --> 28:38.719
- to find a body buried under a slab of cement.
- Can't you get a warrant?

28:38.800 --> 28:43.078
A look around the premises
maybe, but no way to tear it up.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.151
Let me make a phone call.

28:47.720 --> 28:53.158
- Tootie travels the world finding dead bodies.
- Does Tootie always drooI like that?

28:53.240 --> 28:56.835
<i>What? I'm gonna hurt
her... his feelings?</i>

28:56.920 --> 29:00.230
Tootie is the best cadaver
dog in the world, Agent Booth.

29:00.320 --> 29:05.075
It's true. If you were a dead body,
you'd want Tootie looking for you.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.477
- How can it smell anything under a building?
- He can.

29:09.560 --> 29:15.635
Once I saw Tootie find a dead body wrapped
in plastic, under concrete, after four years.

29:15.720 --> 29:19.156
Tootie can smell decaying blood
on a tooth six feet underground.

29:19.240 --> 29:22.277
So what he drools a
little? What's up with that?

29:22.360 --> 29:26.751
You know, your eyes are kinda
close together, but I don't comment.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.149
I apologise.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.754
- Is he sincere?
- Yeah.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.400
All right, then. We accept.

29:37.960 --> 29:41.157
- Good boy. Tootie found something.
- Or he's just lazy.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.959
Lying down is his indicator.

29:44.040 --> 29:47.316
Tootie found it. There's
a body under here.

29:47.400 --> 29:52.599
You should get a warrant to bring
in ajackhammer for the floor.

29:52.680 --> 29:55.240
I'd start digging here.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.435
DentaI records confirm
this is Eve Warren.

30:00.520 --> 30:03.398
Insect activity confirms she
died the same time as Mount.

30:03.480 --> 30:06.472
- Where did Booth go?
- His girlfriend brought him a shirt.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.313
- They're up in the lounge.
- Zack, clean the bones.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.119
We've already got cause
of death and identity.

30:12.200 --> 30:15.670
It might be grasping, but
that odd mark on Mount's skull,

30:15.760 --> 30:18.558
see if you can find anything
like it on Eve's remains.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.518
Jamaica? God, that's incredible.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.398
It's a bed and breakfast.
There are coraI cliffs.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.278
Snorkelling, kayaking.

30:27.360 --> 30:32.593
Oh, you two are so ready for the
pre-shacking-up test vacation.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.831
- What do you mean?
- You have keys to each other's places.

30:35.920 --> 30:40.471
You've done the weekend away a couple
times. It's time for the ten-day vacation.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.438
Jamaica's like a dry run for living
together, only with rum punch and steeI drums.

30:46.520 --> 30:49.034
Yeah. See you later.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.270
Living together? Silly.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.351
Thanks for bringing me a shirt.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.431
Yeah, OK. I'll talk to you later.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.715
Yeah.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.598
- Hi, Tessa.
- Yeah, OK. Bye.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.470
- It's Eve Warren.
- Eve Warren. OK. Cause of death?

31:05.560 --> 31:07.357
- Same as Mount.
- Meth overdose.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.671
Pushed in the face, but I
don't think Rulz killed her.

31:10.760 --> 31:14.469
- She was buried under his studio.
- But her wrist was broken.

31:14.560 --> 31:20.556
Bone damage indicates that Eve was taken
from behind and smashed into a wall.

31:23.600 --> 31:28.515
Her skull shows damage to the infra
- and supraorbitaI margins and zygomatic process.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.672
Zygo-zu...? You said she
was killed by crystaI meth.

31:31.760 --> 31:36.038
She was. She would've been stunned by
the blow, but not killed. Not immediately.

31:36.120 --> 31:42.036
A bag of crystaI meth was placed over her
face, ground into her wounds, into the airway.

31:42.120 --> 31:45.032
Wait. Rulz couldn't have
smashed her into a wall?

31:45.120 --> 31:48.874
Her radius was separated from
the scaphoid and trapezium.

31:48.960 --> 31:51.315
Her right wrist was
twisted behind her back.

31:51.400 --> 31:54.437
There's damage to both
the elbow and shoulder.

31:54.520 --> 31:59.116
For that to happen, Eve's attacker would've
had to twist her arm up with his right hand

31:59.200 --> 32:01.998
while jamming the meth into
her face with the other.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.116
Both with a great deaI of force.

32:04.200 --> 32:08.830
Rulz had been shot twice in the right
hand. I got it. He had nerve damage.

32:08.920 --> 32:12.993
There is no way he had the
strength to kill Eve Warren.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.915
You did not murder Eve Warren.

32:23.360 --> 32:27.990
This is a weird kind of interrogation,
huh? Cops telling me what I didn't do.

32:28.080 --> 32:32.153
Then do me a favour. Tell me Bones is
wrong and confess to a murder, huh, paI?

32:32.240 --> 32:37.155
- Hell, no. You think I'm some type of idiot?
- Well, do me a favour. Deny it.

32:37.240 --> 32:40.630
See, you got tricks. You're
gonna twist all my words around.

32:40.720 --> 32:44.235
- So I better not say anything.
- But you didn't kill Eve Warren.

32:44.320 --> 32:47.392
So you say. The Rulz
says, "Say nothing. "

32:47.480 --> 32:49.516
- He wants us to hold him.
- Why?

32:49.600 --> 32:54.230
Because every time a rapper gets murdered,
his business goes through the roof.

32:54.320 --> 32:58.154
Why should DJ Mount get the
bump, huh? Maybe it's my turn.

32:58.240 --> 33:01.118
I tell you what. I'll
make you a better deaI.

33:01.200 --> 33:05.079
Tell us what we need to know and I'll
have those charges laid against you.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.594
- Put you in the remand centre?
- For how long?

33:07.680 --> 33:11.559
- Depends on what you tell us.
- You're negotiating to put him in jaiI?

33:11.640 --> 33:14.712
I'll sweeten the pot, charge
you with Mount's death, too.

33:14.800 --> 33:21.353
But you hire one of those moron lawyers and
you'll be thrown in lockup for maybe a month.

33:21.440 --> 33:24.750
- Sweet. All right.
- Where am I? In backwards world?

33:24.840 --> 33:28.389
- What have you got?
- I can tell y'all why Mount got killed.

33:28.480 --> 33:32.951
- Figure out the rest on your own.
- We have to figure it outjust from motive?

33:33.040 --> 33:37.875
OK, look, Bones, this is,
you know, sort of my thing.

33:37.960 --> 33:42.078
- Mount was gonnajump.
- You mean commit suicide?

33:42.160 --> 33:44.799
- Where did you find her?
- Museum.

33:44.880 --> 33:47.553
I mean labels. Jump labels.

33:47.640 --> 33:53.317
<i>Wait. You're saying that DJ Mount
was gonna leave Basement Records?</i>

33:53.400 --> 33:57.552
All he needed was the money to buy
himself back. That's why he got killed.

33:57.640 --> 34:02.668
If Hall even finds out I told y'all that
much, I'm gonna end up some mummy in a wall.

34:02.760 --> 34:06.548
- And what about Eve?
- Man, Eve couldn't kill nobody.

34:06.640 --> 34:10.838
You know, sex 'em to death
maybe, but that's about it.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.150
Oh, there was one more thing.

34:13.239 --> 34:17.233
The next day Hall built me a new studio.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.958
He took it out of my money, too.

34:23.480 --> 34:28.918
- So you gonna put me in jaiI?
- Well, you know, hey, it's the least we can do.

34:30.840 --> 34:34.150
Hall's got motive to kill Mount
because he's jumping labels

34:34.239 --> 34:39.917
and he's running away with some girI
who's stealing Hall's meth and money.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.992
I'm starting to see how this
whole motive thing works.

34:43.080 --> 34:46.629
- Thank you.
- It's still murky psychologicaI guesswork.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.559
Dr Brennan, I found
a mark on Eve Warren.

34:50.639 --> 34:54.393
Here, on the manubrium.

34:54.480 --> 34:57.153
- Compare it to the mark on Mount.
- OK.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.549
Eve tells Mount she wants a new life,

34:59.640 --> 35:04.191
so she rips off the dope and the cash,
thinking she can build a new future with him.

35:04.280 --> 35:06.077
That's a story, Booth.

35:06.160 --> 35:09.391
- You need to find something reaI.
- Why? It feels reaI to me.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.835
I mean, Eve is a woman in love

35:11.920 --> 35:16.357
who is trying to escape a world
that's just crushing her. Hm?

35:19.920 --> 35:25.119
All right, Mount finds out how much
trouble the woman he's in love with is in,

35:25.200 --> 35:28.192
so he gives up his own
life to protect her.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.555
That's not enough.

35:32.840 --> 35:37.630
They were hoping for a better
life, and they wound up dead.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.315
Looks like a match.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.868
Thanks. Good job.

35:51.960 --> 35:55.669
- What the hell's that?
- I'm not sure. It's a bone dimple.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.990
They both have it so
it can't be genetic.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.117
Something externaI caused
it, but I'm not sure what.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.156
Randall Hall.

36:03.240 --> 36:07.153
He's behind this. Randall Hall,
OK? He killed these two people.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.595
We know it. He did it.
We just can't touch him.

36:09.680 --> 36:13.878
And there's no evidence linking him
to the drugs, the cash, or either body,

36:13.960 --> 36:16.349
except for a couple
of damn bone dimples.

36:16.440 --> 36:20.752
I'll keep looking at the remains,
maybe find the evidence we need.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.512
- I can't let it stand.
- What?

36:22.600 --> 36:26.388
I'm gonna spread the pain,
OK? That's my new motto.

36:26.480 --> 36:29.790
Wait! I can help spread pain! Wait!

36:32.840 --> 36:34.592
- We know you did it.
- What?

36:34.680 --> 36:37.148
Killed Mount so he
wouldn't leave your labeI.

36:37.240 --> 36:41.438
- You killed Eve Warren.
- And buried her under Rulz's studio.

36:42.280 --> 36:46.034
Meantime, this is gonna have
to remain an active crime scene.

36:46.120 --> 36:49.271
It's harassment. I'll sue.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.989
And I'm gonna harass
you every chance I get.

36:54.760 --> 36:58.355
I'm not somebody you wanna mess with.

37:00.560 --> 37:03.199
Did you just poke me?

37:06.040 --> 37:09.157
Did he just poke me
with his little stick?

37:09.240 --> 37:13.711
This is my place. I wanna poke
someone, I do it. Come on...

37:18.640 --> 37:21.916
All right. How easily
do you think I scare?

37:22.000 --> 37:24.309
Hey, Booth! Don't break the cane.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.914
Arrest him and confiscate
the cane as evidence.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.549
<i>- I need the cane.
- Arrest him for what? He pointed the gun.</i>

37:30.640 --> 37:35.111
Harbouring threats, smelling bad,
or anything. It's the cane we want.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.760
Well, then here. Randall Hall,

37:37.840 --> 37:42.516
I'm placing you under arrest for
the assault of a federaI agent.

37:43.600 --> 37:47.354
- This'll never go to court.
- Oh, let's go find out, huh?

37:48.120 --> 37:50.918
Next time I take your gun,
I'll shoot you with it.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.879
Well, then I better not
let you get my gun again.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.428
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

38:05.240 --> 38:10.473
Get this. I called Tessa to tell her a
couple places she should check out in Jamaica.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.596
- She's not going.
- What happened?

38:12.680 --> 38:16.229
She said something came up
at work, but I know the truth.

38:16.320 --> 38:20.632
- How many times you want me to poke Zack?
- Just once, but as hard as you can.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.439
As hard as he can? Why don't
I hit him as hard as I can?

38:23.520 --> 38:26.193
Because you have arms
like noodles. I am burly.

38:26.280 --> 38:30.478
- What truth?
- Argh! Is that all you got, burly boy?

38:30.560 --> 38:34.712
- They got freaked out by stage six.
- What's stage six?

38:34.800 --> 38:38.076
One: spend the night.
Two: spend the weekend.

38:38.160 --> 38:41.869
Three: exchange keys.
Four: sexy weekend getaway.

38:41.960 --> 38:46.351
Five: extended vacation inevitably
followed by six: move in together.

38:46.840 --> 38:50.594
I'm an anthropologist. I know the
stages of everything. You made those up.

38:50.680 --> 38:55.800
- I did not! They got to stage five and balked.
- Not Booth. Booth did not balk.

38:55.880 --> 38:58.269
- It's always the guy.
- Booth is not a balker.

38:58.360 --> 39:01.670
Hey. The mark on Mount and
the mark on Eve are the same.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.832
He can't resist hitting
them with that stupid cane.

39:04.920 --> 39:09.357
The end of the cane
- it's a fit for both marks. Hall is the killer.

39:09.440 --> 39:13.797
Send the cane, the photos and the medium
to the FBI. Let them confirm the match.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.952
- What? Let them have all the glory?
- My chest hurts.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.429
Yeah. All the glory.

39:21.680 --> 39:25.309
<i>Here's what we know. Evidence
linking rap producer Randall Hall</i>

39:25.400 --> 39:28.676
<i>with the death of rising
hip-hop star DJ Mount</i>

39:28.760 --> 39:31.638
<i>led to charges being filed
by the district attorney.</i>

39:31.720 --> 39:35.759
<i>Information coming to us
slowly, but as soon as details...</i>

39:40.000 --> 39:42.673
Getting yourself in the mood?

39:42.760 --> 39:44.671
Trying.

39:45.680 --> 39:49.719
You know, this really isn't gonna be
the type of vacation I was hoping for.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.631
Oh?

39:51.720 --> 39:55.429
Tessa's not going.
Something came up at work.

39:55.920 --> 39:59.310
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

40:01.040 --> 40:04.271
Hey, I like going on
vacations by myself.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.955
- Really?
- Sure. Nothing wrong with being alone.

40:08.040 --> 40:13.797
- No. I mean, you like to go on vacation?
- Yeah. I go places all the time.

40:16.840 --> 40:21.630
Do you everjust, you know, sit on the beach,
pretend there's no such thing as skeletons?

40:21.720 --> 40:23.790
Is that in any way fun?

40:24.360 --> 40:27.670
- When was the last time you got away?
- Got away from what?

40:30.080 --> 40:35.359
Oh, Bones, you know, because
what usually happens to me...

40:37.040 --> 40:40.396
- I think about not coming back.
- Seriously?

40:40.480 --> 40:43.552
Yeah. You know, you go with someone,

40:43.640 --> 40:47.872
you joke about not going
back to your reaI life,

40:47.960 --> 40:50.235
the two of you laugh.

40:50.320 --> 40:55.235
But, when you're alone, the
world is full of possibilities.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.759
See you next week.
