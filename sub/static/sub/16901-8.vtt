PEOPLE OF PACIFIC RIM,
HOW YOU FEEL?

08:07.904 --> 08:09.280
ALL RIGHT!

08:09.572 --> 08:10.740
I'D LIKE TO THANK MY WIFE,

08:11.032 --> 08:14.285
MY TWO SONS,
TRACY JR., AND GEORGE FOREMAN,

08:14.577 --> 08:16.621
THIS JOSH DUDE,

08:16.913 --> 08:18.289
LIZ LEMON,

08:18.581 --> 08:21.418
<i>UH...BALDHEADED PETE
FOR SETTING UP THE SATELLITE,</i>

08:21.710 --> 08:26.464
AND OF COURSE,
A VERY SPECIAL BLONDE LADY.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.341
SHELLY LONG, YOU'RE TRULY
AN INSPIRATION TO ME!

08:28.633 --> 08:29.551
I KNOW THAT!

08:29.843 --> 08:31.261
<i>AND FINALLY,
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU,</i>

08:31.553 --> 08:34.097
PACIFIC RIMMERS,
FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.057
KARAOKE, KARATE,

08:36.349 --> 08:38.518
AND MOST OF ALL...

08:38.809 --> 08:40.812
<i>WANIZAME ATAKKU!</i>

08:41.104 --> 08:42.313
SHARK ATTACK!

08:42.605 --> 08:43.313
[gasps]

08:44.774 --> 08:46.484
OKAY, SO YOU GOT
SHARKED.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.694
THAT'S NOT GREAT.

08:47.986 --> 08:48.987
I'M SO HUMILIATED.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.614
HOVV COULD TRACY NOT THANK ME?
VVHAT?

08:51.906 --> 08:53.825
I DRAG MYSELF OUT OF BED
AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING,

08:54.117 --> 08:55.452
GO HOME, GET DRESSED,
COME IN HERE,

08:55.744 --> 08:57.412
AND HE DOESN'T
EVEN MENTION MY NAME?

08:57.704 --> 08:59.289
JENNA, THE WHOLE THING
IS FAKE.

08:59.581 --> 09:00.999
YEAH, BUT HE THOUGHT
IT WAS REAL.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.251
LISTEN, I'M SORRY.
TONIGHT WAS CRAZY.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.462
BUT I DID HEAR
THE JANITOR SAYING

09:05.754 --> 09:06.796
THAT YOUR BOOBS
LOOKED GOOD.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.090
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT, LIZ.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.426
APPARENTLY, THE ONLY WAY
TO GET RESPECT AROUND HERE

09:11.718 --> 09:12.761
IS TO ACT LIKE TRACY.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.263
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.390
NOW, PLEASE, GET OUT
OF MY DRESSING ROOM

09:17.682 --> 09:18.600
SO I CAN LOCK MYSELF
IN IT.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.393
[sighing]
OH...

09:23.021 --> 09:24.522
<i>AAH!
THE SQUIRREL!</i>

09:24.814 --> 09:26.941
<i>IT'S NOT AFRAID
OF PEOPLE!</i>

09:31.029 --> 09:33.531
OH, HI, C.C.
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR JACK?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.575
NO, ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING
TO TALK TO YOU.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.160
<i>I HOPE YOU HAD FUN
LAST NIGHT.</i>

09:37.452 --> 09:38.119
I DID.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.331
BOY, YOU AND JACK
MAKE A HELL OF A CELEBRITY TEAM.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.458
THIS IS THAT CHICK WHO--
VENUS WILLIAMS.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.126
REMEMBER THAT TIME
YOU FELL ASLEEP?

09:45.418 --> 09:46.377
CAPTAIN BEEFHEART.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.421
IT'S LIKE WE SHARE A BRAIN.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.048
I'M SORRY YOU GOT
STUCK WITH KENNETH.

09:50.340 --> 09:53.301
OKAY. THIS IS NOT A CHARACTER
FROM A TELEVISION PROGRAM.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.095
<i>OKAY, THIS IS NOT</i>

09:55.386 --> 09:56.346
A CHARACTER FROM THE BIBLE.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.306
<i>UH...PASS.</i>

09:58.598 --> 10:00.225
YOU CAN'T PASS,
YOU HILLBILLY.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.643
NO, I'M SORRY.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.187
I DON'T NORMALLY
SLAP PEOPLE.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.147
LIZ, I HATE TO PUT YOU
ON THE SPOT,

10:06.439 --> 10:08.316
BUT YOU KNOW THAT I CAN'T TALK
TO ANY OF MY FRIENDS ABOUT JACK.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.110
WE CAN'T KEEP
SNEAKING AROUND.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.486
THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.115
I'M-A...THE PLUMBER.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.200
I'M HERE-A TO FIX-A
THE WASHING MACHINE.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.160
COME RIGHT IN,
MR. SPUNATELLI.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.037
IF JACK AND I
ARE GONNA STAY TOGETHER,

10:21.329 --> 10:23.289
ONE OF US HAS GOT
TO GIVE SOMETHING UP.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.958
I JUST--I MEAN,
IS JACK WORTH IT?

10:25.250 --> 10:26.459
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

10:26.751 --> 10:27.335
OH, I DON'T THINK YOU WANT

10:27.627 --> 10:29.129
TO TAKE ADVICE FROM ME
ON THIS.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.880
I MEAN, I ATE
A THREE MUSKETEERS BAR

10:31.172 --> 10:32.298
FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING,

10:32.590 --> 10:34.175
AND THIS BRA IS HELD
TOGETHER WITH TAPE, BUT--

10:34.467 --> 10:35.635
OH, LIZ, PLEASE.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.179
OH...WELL, JACK IS GREAT.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.014
AND HE'S CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.392
BUT HAVE YOU EVER COMPROMISED
FOR A MAN BEFORE?

10:42.684 --> 10:43.768
NO.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.979
ME EITHER.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.148
OH, GOD, IT WAS
MY BIRTHDAY YESTERDAY.

10:48.439 --> 10:49.816
AW...

10:51.693 --> 10:52.944
I'M GONNA TALK TO JACK.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.155
YEAH, I THINK YOU SHOULD.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.614
[softly]
OW.

11:01.035 --> 11:04.122
HEY, GUYS, IT'S ME, FRANK.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.623
OH, NO!
ESCALATION!

11:05.915 --> 11:06.916
<i>OKAY, THAT HAT'S
NOT COOL, JACKASS.</i>

11:07.208 --> 11:09.210
MY MOM'S A GREAT LADY.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.796
OH, WAS IT HER GREATNESS
THAT MADE YOUR DAD LEAVE?

11:12.088 --> 11:12.964
HO HO!
OH!

11:13.256 --> 11:14.132
HE DIDN'T LEAVE.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.426
HE'S A SUBMARINE COMMANDER
RUNNING SILENT.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.052
LET'S WATCH THIS
INSTEAD OF WORKING.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.220
TAKE OFF THAT COSTUME.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.556
TAKE OFF YOURS!
NEVER.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.314
C.C., WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

11:29.606 --> 11:33.067
JACK, I CONVINCED THE SHEINHARDT
WIG PLAINTIFFS TO SETTLE.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.944
THAT'S FANTASTIC NEWS.
WHAT DID THEY END UP GETTING?

11:35.236 --> 11:36.196
5 MILLION EACH.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.323
5 MILLION...EACH.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.159
THAT'S...
NBA SEXUAL ASSAULT MONEY.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.076
THEY DESERVED MORE.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.871
THE POINT IS,
NOW YOU AND I CAN GO PUBLIC.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.831
WE DON'T HAVE TO SNEAK
AROUND ANYMORE.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.209
SLOW DOWN, C.C.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.794
WELL, WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?

11:52.086 --> 11:53.296
I'M STILL UP
FOR A BIG PROMOTION.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.340
MY COLLEAGUES
STILL REVILE YOU.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.508
BUT MAYBE IN A YEAR OR SO,
WE COULD REASSESS.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.136
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I HAVE GIVEN UP FOR YOU?

12:00.428 --> 12:03.139
THOSE LITTLE ORANGE CHILDREN
DESERVED THEIR DAY IN COURT.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.807
THEY GOT 5 MILLION.
EACH.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.517
BUT THEY DESERVED
TO BE HEARD, JACK.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.936
AND I WAS READY
TO SPEAK FOR THEM.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.896
WE WERE GOING TO GO
ON <i>OPRAH.</i>

12:10.188 --> 12:11.481
OH, SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT
THOSE KIDS.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.316
IT'S ABOUT YOU GETTING
SOME PUBLICITY

12:13.608 --> 12:14.776
TO GET A LEG UP
ON YOUR POLITICAL CAREER.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.237
I'M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE
FOR BEING AMBITIOUS, JACK.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.446
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.739
I LIKE WHEN A WOMAN
HAS AMBITION.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.449
IT'S LIKE SEEING A DOG
WEARING CLOTHES.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.284
I WAS WILLING TO GIVE
ALL THAT UP FOR YOU.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.328
BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
NOT WILLING TO DO THE SAME.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.454
I JUST NEED MORE TIME.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.164
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
LISTENED TO A WOMAN

12:28.456 --> 12:29.624
WHO TAPES HER BRA
TOGETHER.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.334
LEMON.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.254
DON'T WORRY, JACK.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.798
I WILL SNEAK OUT
THROUGH THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

12:37.090 --> 12:37.924
<i>LIKE IALWAYS DO.</i>

12:38.216 --> 12:39.008
<i>I WON'T EMBARRASS YOU.</i>

12:44.138 --> 12:46.349
EVERYBODY LOOKS GOOD
IN A SHEINHARDT.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.312
<i>(Pete) SOMETHING'S
GOING DOWN WITH JENNA.</i>

12:51.604 --> 12:52.272
SHE TOLD AN NBC TOUR

12:52.563 --> 12:53.982
THAT SHE WAS GONNA
GET THEM ALL PREGNANT.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.109
SO NOW I HAVE
TWO TRACYS--PERFECT.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.486
WILL YOU TRADE JOBS
WITH ME?

12:58.778 --> 13:01.197
OKAY. BUT JENNA WANTS THIS
DONE A SPECIFIC WAY.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.533
SHE'S IN
HER DRESSING ROOM.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.035
GODSPEED, LIZ LEMON.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.038
(Frank) LIZ, \/VE HAVE
A SERIOUS CRISIS.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.790
WE'RE MAD
AT EACH OTHER--

13:11.082 --> 13:13.209
WHAT? NO. I HAVE LEGITIMATE
PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.753
BUT THE TOOFER/FRANK RIVALRY
HAS FINALLY EXPLODED.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.714
NO ONE CARES.
MOVE, YOU'RE BLOCKING ME.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.882
I'M TRYING TO GET
SOMEWHERE REAL.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.592
[knocking]

13:21.884 --> 13:23.720
UM, HI.
IS JENNA IN THERE?

13:24.012 --> 13:25.680
BITCH, ARE YOU IN HERE?

13:25.972 --> 13:26.848
<i>(Jenna)
MM-HMM.</i>

13:29.058 --> 13:31.352
<i>JENNA, WHY ARE YOU
NOT AT REHEARSAL?</i>

13:31.644 --> 13:33.730
MY ENTOURAGE
SAYS I LOOK TIRED.

13:34.022 --> 13:34.856
I'M SASHA.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.817
THIS IS PATRICE
AND MASTER ALEXEI.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.569
<i>AND YOUR NAME</i>

13:39.861 --> 13:41.571
I PROBABLY SOMETHING
LIKE...

13:41.863 --> 13:42.947
MELISSA.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.657
OKAY. I GET IT. FINE.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.409
WHAT DO I NEED TO DO
TO MAKE YOU FEEL APPRECIATED

13:46.701 --> 13:47.702
AND GET THEM OUT OF HERE?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.079
TOO LATE.
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.914
OOH, MELISSA!
PICK UP YOUR FACE, GIRL.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.416
(Jenna)
I'M GOING TO GET

13:53.708 --> 13:54.959
MY EYEBALLS WHITENED.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.961
I'LL BE BACK
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.339
IF I FEEL LIKE IT.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.507
WHAT? NO!
WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

14:01.799 --> 14:02.717
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET

14:03.009 --> 14:04.135
FOR TAKING ME FOR GRANTED
ALL THIS TIME.

14:04.427 --> 14:05.219
<i>DEAL WITH THA T.</i>

14:05.511 --> 14:06.637
OH, MELISSA!

14:06.929 --> 14:08.014
YOUR FACE
IS ON THE PHONE.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.390
<i>SOCCER PRACTICE IS OVER,</i>

14:09.682 --> 14:11.559
AND YOU NEED...
TO PICK IT UP!

14:11.851 --> 14:13.936
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
A PRETTY GOOD BURN, PATRICE.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.398
WELL, LEMON,
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.608
I'M NOT. WHY?

14:18.900 --> 14:20.985
C.C. IS DEMANDING THAT WE
GO PUBLIC WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP,

14:21.277 --> 14:21.986
WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE,

14:22.278 --> 14:23.654
AND YOUPUT THE IDEA
IN HER HEAD.

14:23.946 --> 14:24.739
I'M SORRY, JACK.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.949
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST SAYING
WHAT EVERYBODY'S THINKING.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.576
YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.412
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.956
I'LL TAKE THE NEXT ONE,
CARVILLE.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.542
UH, ACTUALLY--

14:36.834 --> 14:39.003
HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE?

14:40.922 --> 14:42.757
HOW DO YOU AND MARY MATALIN
MAKE IT WORK?

14:43.049 --> 14:46.386
I MEAN, SHE'S A BRILLIANT
PATRIOTIC REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST,

14:46.677 --> 14:47.720
AND YOU--LET'S FACE lT--

14:48.012 --> 14:49.806
ARE A PINKO NUT JOB.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.057
YOU KNOW, MARY AND I PROVED

14:51.349 --> 14:52.642
THAT TRUE LOVE
CAN WEATHER ANY STORM.

14:52.934 --> 14:53.768
<i>EVEN DESERT STORM.</i>

14:54.060 --> 14:55.853
BUT IF IT'S THE OPINION
OF YOUR PEERS

14:56.145 --> 14:56.938
THAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT,

14:57.230 --> 14:58.606
YOU NEED TO GET OUT
IN FRONT OF THE STORY--

14:58.898 --> 15:00.441
"CAJUN STYLE."

15:00.733 --> 15:02.276
BREAK THE NEWS
ON YOUR OWN TERMS,

15:02.568 --> 15:03.986
BEFORE YOUR ENEMIES
FIND OUT.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.738
CAJUN STYLE.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.323
DATING A DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSWOMAN?

15:07.615 --> 15:09.742
THESE GUYS
WILL DESTROY ME FOR THIS.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.328
JACK, IS IT REALLY THE OPINION
OF OTHERS THAT YOU WORRY ABOUT,

15:12.620 --> 15:15.039
OR ARE YOU LEARNING SOMETHING
NEW ABOUT YOURSELF,

15:15.331 --> 15:16.666
AND YOU FIND THAT
A LITTLE SCARY?

15:19.168 --> 15:21.045
CAJUN STYLE.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.215
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

15:24.507 --> 15:26.676
IF WE GIVE UP OUR FEUD NOW,
WE'LL BE RIDICULED.

15:26.968 --> 15:29.053
REMEMBER WHEN LUTZ CRIED
DURING THAT DIAMOND COMMERCIAL?

15:29.345 --> 15:30.471
IT'LL BE WORSE
THAN THAT.

15:30.763 --> 15:31.848
OH, BUT I CAN'T KEEP
DRESSING LIKE YOU.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.808
THE <i>NEW</i> YORKER FESTIVAL
IS NEXT WEEK.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.685
WE'RE TRAPPED
IN A POLITICAL MINEFIELD.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.645
HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET OUT OF IT?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.480
<i>(Carville) YOU BOYS NEED
TO CHANGE YOUR STORY.</i>

15:39.772 --> 15:42.150
LIKE KARL ROVE DID
IN THE LAST ELECTION

15:42.442 --> 15:44.694
WHEN HE MADE IT ABOUT
GAY FOLKS AND SWIFT BOATS.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.988
WHAT'S YOUR SWIFT BOAT?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.698
<i>YOU DIDN'T HEAR THIS
FROM ME,</i>

15:48.990 --> 15:51.200
BUT JOSH IS STARTING TO DO
SOMETHING NEW WITH HIS HAIR.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.702
ARE YOU
JAMES CARVILLE?

15:52.994 --> 15:55.872
DROP ME AN EMAIL AND LET ME KNOW
HOW IT GOES.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.044
<i>TRYING TO STEAL CANDY

HOW IT'S DONE.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.259
CAJUN STYLE.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.844
EXCUSE ME.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.180
