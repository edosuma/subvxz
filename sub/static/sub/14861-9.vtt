WEBVTT

00:01.272 --> 00:02.273
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA SNEAK UP
ON THIS CASTLE,

00:02.273 --> 00:03.304
SO DON'T ATTACK THIS OGRE.

00:03.304 --> 00:05.136
OH, MAN, I ACCIDENTALLY
SHRUNK MYSELF

00:05.136 --> 00:07.078
WITH THE ORB OF SHRINKING.

00:07.078 --> 00:09.310
UGH. I WISH WE COULD STOP
PLAYING THIS GAME. I'M SUCKING!

00:09.310 --> 00:12.012
WELL, "BADASS 2" COMES OUT
IN 36 HOURS,

00:12.012 --> 00:13.344
AND THAT IS GONNA BE...

00:13.344 --> 00:14.345
(all) BADASS!

00:14.345 --> 00:16.187
2!

00:16.187 --> 00:18.018
I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT
WE WERE DOING THE WHOLE NAME.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.090
YOU GUYS GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED
TO CAMP OUT

00:19.090 --> 00:20.151
IN LINE TOMORROW NIGHT?

00:20.151 --> 00:22.193
BEER, ME... YEP, I'M GOOD.

00:22.193 --> 00:23.354
DIBS ON THE HEALTH PACK.

00:23.354 --> 00:25.296
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, GO!
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, GO!

00:25.296 --> 00:27.228
Paper. You?
PAPER. GO AGAIN.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.360
YOU GUYS CAN'T SEE EACH OTHER.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LIE?

00:29.360 --> 00:32.032
UH, BECAUSE THAT
WOULD BE WRONG, WILL.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.033
(video game
playing indistinctly)

00:33.033 --> 00:34.165
BUT ACTUALLY,

00:34.165 --> 00:36.267
LOOKING AT MY HAND AGAIN,
I REALIZE THAT I HAVE SCISSORS.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.209
OH, YEAH, AND I REALIZE
I HAVE ROCK.

00:38.209 --> 00:40.071
AH, MY MISTAKE.
I HAVE PAPER.

00:40.071 --> 00:41.342
HA. THAT'S SO WEIRD.
I HAVE SCISSORS.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.244
AND I HAVE ROCK.
PAPER.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.375
SCISSORS.
All right!

00:44.375 --> 00:49.350
NOW I SEE WHY LYING
DOESN'T WORK.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.123
ALL RIGHT, STOVE--CHECK,
SLEEPING BAG--CHECK,

00:52.123 --> 00:55.256
WHITE NOISE MACHINE--CHECK.
WHAT AM I MISSING?

00:55.256 --> 00:57.128
THE IRONY THAT YOU'RE AN ADULT
CAMPING OUT IN A PARKING LOT

00:57.128 --> 00:58.359
TO BUY A CHILDREN'S GAME?

00:58.359 --> 01:01.362
HMM. IT SEEMS I HAVE
TWO WHITE NOISE MACHINES.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.195
HMM.
WHICH ONE
SHALL I LEAVE BEHIND?

01:04.195 --> 01:05.336
I'LL BE BACK IN 20 MINUTES.
I'M JUST GONNA RUN TO PRICE BEST

01:05.336 --> 01:07.138
TO GET THE APPLE JUICE
FOR THE SOCCER TEAM TOMORROW.

01:07.138 --> 01:09.100
I TOLD YOU,
I'LL GET THE APPLE JUICE.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.302
I'M GONNA BE AT PRICE BEST
FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS.

01:11.302 --> 01:12.343
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
IT'S THE RIGHT KIND.

01:12.343 --> 01:13.404
THE SOCCER MOMS
ARE STILL MAD AT ME

01:13.404 --> 01:15.346
ABOUT THE TRAIL MIX INCIDENT.

01:15.346 --> 01:17.148
EACH KID WAS ALLERGIC
TO A DIFFERENT THING

01:17.148 --> 01:19.250
IN THAT GIANT BAG OF DEATH
YOU BROUGHT HOME.

01:19.250 --> 01:20.251
(horn honks)

01:20.251 --> 01:21.382
OH.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.314
NATHAN, SCOTT'S MOM IS HERE!

01:23.314 --> 01:25.456
THERESA, I KNOW WHAT
APPLE JUICE TO GET.

01:25.456 --> 01:28.119
6-OUNCE, GLASS BOTTLES,
NO SUGAR.

01:28.119 --> 01:29.220
AND ORGANIC.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.392
WELL, OF COURSE ORGANIC.
WHAT AM I, A MONSTER?

01:31.392 --> 01:33.294
I'M NOT SURE I DESERVE
THIS SLEEPOVER

01:33.294 --> 01:36.197
SINCE I ONLY GOT A "B"
ON THE HISTORY TEST.

01:36.197 --> 01:39.130
SO YOU GOT YOUR FIRST "B."
IT'S OKAY.

01:39.130 --> 01:41.272
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.
GO HAVE FUN.

01:41.272 --> 01:43.474
I HOPE NOBODY ASKS
ABOUT THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE,

01:43.474 --> 01:46.277
OR I'LL JUST MAKE A JACKASS
OUT OF MYSELF AGAIN.

01:46.277 --> 01:48.209
HEY, NATHAN, HOW'S IT GOING?
HEY, BUDDY.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.380
I GOT A "B" ON MY HISTORY TEST.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.242
OH, GOOD FOR YOU.
SHOWBOAT.

01:51.242 --> 01:52.483
HE TAKES EVERYTHING
SO SERIOUSLY.

01:52.483 --> 01:54.315
HE JUST WANTS
TO DO A GOOD JOB,

01:54.315 --> 01:56.217
UNLIKE THESE TWO,

01:56.217 --> 01:58.219
ONE OF WHOM FORGOT
TO WEAR SHOES.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.321
WHEN?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.452
OH. NOW.

02:01.452 --> 02:04.355
RIGHT. WE GOTTA STOP
AND GET MY SHOES.

02:05.396 --> 02:06.457
(slap)

02:06.457 --> 02:09.129
GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU
FOR THIS INVITATION.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.201
I CAN ALREADY FEEL
THE TRIVIALITIES OF MODERN LIFE

02:10.201 --> 02:12.463
FADING QUIETLY AWAY.

02:12.463 --> 02:15.206
(cell phone alert chimes)
SON OF A...!

02:15.206 --> 02:18.339
SOME BUTT-COZY JUST OUTBID ME
ON A 12-INCH C-3PO.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.470
FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS,

02:19.470 --> 02:21.272
THE SAME PERSON
HAS BEEN OUTBIDDING ME

02:21.272 --> 02:24.144
ON EVERY ACTION FIGURE
I'VE TRIED TO GET.

02:25.216 --> 02:26.217
(cell phone alert chimes)

02:26.217 --> 02:28.148
OH, COME ON! THEY DID IT AGAIN!

02:28.148 --> 02:30.481
JUST KEEPS GETTING HARDER
AND HARDER TO BE A NERD.

02:30.481 --> 02:34.355
I THINK I KNOW THE PERSON
WHO'S DOING THIS,

02:34.355 --> 02:37.228
AND I THINK YOU KNOW
WHO IT IS, TOO.

02:37.228 --> 02:39.430
IT'S... YOO.

02:39.430 --> 02:42.193
YOO CHANG.

02:42.193 --> 02:44.495
THE WAITER
FROM THE CHINESE RESTAURANT,

02:44.495 --> 02:46.166
WHO I WRONGLY ACCUSED

02:46.166 --> 02:47.368
OF PICKING ALL THE CHICKEN
OUT OF MY CHOW MEIN.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.499
(whispers)
IT'S GOTTA BE HIM.

02:48.499 --> 02:50.241
I'LL BET YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:50.241 --> 02:51.372
IT'S THE ONLY LOGICAL
EXPLANATION.

02:51.372 --> 02:54.174
COME ON, KENNY. LET IT GO.
WE SHOULD HEAD OUT.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.246
AND?

02:55.246 --> 02:58.449
AND ORGANIC APPLE JUICE.
I WILL NOT FORGET.

02:58.449 --> 02:59.480
(lowered voice) YOU GUYS,

02:59.480 --> 03:01.212
ICANNOTFORGET
THAT APPLE JUICE.

03:01.212 --> 03:02.553
THIS WILL BE A SPECIAL NIGHT,
MY FRIENDS.

03:02.553 --> 03:06.257
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE BEING
OUT IN THE CLEAN FRESH AIR OF...

03:06.257 --> 03:08.389
THE PRICE BEST PARKING LOT?

03:08.389 --> 03:11.322
YOU SAID WE WERE GOING
AFTER BIG GAME.

03:11.322 --> 03:13.193
NO, I SAID A BIG GAME
IS BEING RELEASED.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.466
I BOUGHT A CROSSBOW.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.328
LISTEN UP, NERDS.

03:17.328 --> 03:19.370
YOU WILL HAVE YOUR HAND STAMPED.

03:19.370 --> 03:21.332
YOU WILL NEED A HAND STAMP

03:21.332 --> 03:24.305
TO GET THIS SAD, PATHETIC
VIDEO GAME.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.377
ONCE YOUR HAND IS STAMPED,

03:26.377 --> 03:27.478
YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED
IN THE STORE

03:27.478 --> 03:29.440
UNTIL THIS
COLOSSAL WASTE OF TIME

03:29.440 --> 03:31.582
GOES ON SALE TOMORROW MORNING.

03:31.582 --> 03:34.285
THIS IS TO PREVENT YOU FROM
HIDING IN THE STORE ALL NIGHT

03:34.285 --> 03:36.347
AND CUTTING IN LINE.

03:36.347 --> 03:38.289
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.

03:38.289 --> 03:39.350
(wheels scrape)

03:39.350 --> 03:43.254
ON A PERSONAL NOTE,
YOU ALL SICKEN ME.

03:43.254 --> 03:45.296
(whirring)

03:45.296 --> 03:47.328
HE SEEMS STERN BUT FAIR.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.229
I BET HE'S GOOD WITH HORSES.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.461
OKAY, FIRST THINGS FIRST.

03:50.461 --> 03:52.263
I'M GONNA RUN INSIDE
AND GET THE APPLE JUICE

03:52.263 --> 03:54.465
BEFORE THEY START
STAMPING HANDS.

03:54.465 --> 03:57.468
I'M GONNA FIND
A PRIMO SPOT IN LINE.

03:57.468 --> 04:00.541
CRAIG, ADVENTURE CALLS.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.273
I SHALL BID YOU FAREWELL
AND SPEND THE NIGHT

04:02.273 --> 04:05.245
WALKING TOWARDS
THAT DISTANT STAR...

04:05.245 --> 04:08.248
WHICH MIGHT BE A PLANE...

04:08.248 --> 04:09.620
IN WHICH CASE
I'LL PICK A NEW THING.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.523
(chuckles) BUT THIS IS
GONNA BE SO AWESOME.

04:12.523 --> 04:14.385
I MEAN, LOOK HOW INTO THIS
EVERYBODY IS.

04:14.385 --> 04:16.587
I JUST DON'T GET WHY SOMEONE
WOULD WANT TO LOSE THEMSELVES

04:16.587 --> 04:18.459
IN A FANTASY WORLD WHEN
EVERY MOMENT OF REAL LIFE

04:18.459 --> 04:19.630
IS SO WONDERFUL.

04:19.630 --> 04:22.393
WELL, SOMETIMES IT'S FUN TO
JUST TRY ON BEING SOMEONE ELSE.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.398
I TOLD YOU! IT'S BADASS.

04:35.606 --> 04:37.608
HE WAS TOO SCARED
TO COME OVER HERE.

04:37.608 --> 04:41.582
SOME THINGS IN LIFE ARE SCARY,
BUT REMEMBER,

04:41.582 --> 04:43.514
COURAGE IS NOT THE LACK OF FEAR.

04:43.514 --> 04:46.387
IT'S TAKING ACTION
DESPITE THAT FEAR.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.619
(both) WHOA.

04:48.619 --> 04:50.621
I READ THAT
ON A SNAPPLE CAP.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.367
HELP ME MOVE THAT PLANT
INTO THIS CERAMIC POT.

04:56.367 --> 04:58.399
WE'RE HAVING A PARTY
FOR LUCY'S SOCCER TEAM TOMORROW,

04:58.399 --> 05:00.431
AND THERE'S GONNA BE
15 JUDGMENTAL BITCHES HERE

05:00.431 --> 05:02.533
CRITICIZING EVERY INCH
OF MY HOME.

05:02.533 --> 05:04.375
EASY. THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN.

05:04.375 --> 05:08.509
OOH, WATCH THIS. SOMEWHERE,
KENNY IS ABOUT TO SCREAM. HA HA!

05:08.509 --> 05:10.441
OH, COME ON, BRENDA.
GIVE MY BROTHER A BREAK.

05:10.441 --> 05:12.583
I AM TEACHING HIM
RESPONSIBILITY.

05:12.583 --> 05:15.686
A FULL-GROWN MAN
SHOULD NOT BE SPENDING $280

05:15.686 --> 05:18.349
FOR A DOLL OF A ROBOT.

05:18.349 --> 05:19.690
WHEN YOU CALL HIM
A "CAVE TROLL" TO HIS FACE

05:19.690 --> 05:21.592
AND HE CALLS YOU
A "SWAMP DONKEY,"

05:21.592 --> 05:23.323
IT SEEMS FAIR.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.655
BUT ANONYMOUSLY ATTACKING HIM
THROUGH THE INTERNET

05:24.655 --> 05:26.326
JUST SEEMS CRUEL.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.500
OH, THERESA,
I'M NOT CRUEL.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.601
(grunting)
(straining voice) MAN!

05:30.601 --> 05:32.503
THIS THING'S HEAVIER
THAN KENNY.

05:32.503 --> 05:34.435
THANK GOD IT'S NOT
ON TOP OF ME, SWEATING.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.407
SEE? WHAT IS THAT?
HE'S NOT EVEN HERE.

05:36.407 --> 05:37.608
WELL, THEN TELL HIM
I SAID IT.

05:37.608 --> 05:39.510
YOU REALLY SHOULD EASE UP,
BRENDA.

05:39.510 --> 05:40.541
AND YOU REALLY SHOULD STOP

05:40.541 --> 05:42.443
TELLING PEOPLE WHAT TO DO,
THERESA.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.475
WELL, SOME PEOPLE NEED TO BE
TOLD WHAT TO DO.

05:44.475 --> 05:46.417
OHH! JEEZ, IF I WANTED
TO BE TIPSY AND YELLED AT,

05:46.417 --> 05:48.379
I'D GO TO MY PARENTS' HOUSE.

05:48.379 --> 05:50.451
WELL, FINE. THEN GO.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.452
(both grunt)

05:51.452 --> 05:54.385
FINE. I WILL...

05:54.385 --> 05:56.387
SOON AS I GET MY HANDS
OUT OF THIS POT.

05:56.387 --> 05:58.559
TAKE YOUR HANDS OUT
SO I CAN GET MINE OUT.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.464
I CAN'T. I'M STUCK, TOO.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.368
HI. MY NAME IS KELLY.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.369
(both) DIBS.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.601
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS. GO!

06:10.601 --> 06:11.702
(whispers) DAMN.

06:11.702 --> 06:13.474
(both, lowered voices)
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, GO.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.705
(normal voice) I HAVE SCISSORS.
(normal voice) I HAVE ROCK.

06:14.705 --> 06:16.547
AND I HAVE PAPER.
I HAVE SCISSORS.

06:16.547 --> 06:18.749
AND I HAVE ROCK.
DON'T I GET A SAY
IN WHO WINS ME?

06:18.749 --> 06:21.582
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
YOU CHOOSE.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.613
(exhales deeply)

06:22.613 --> 06:23.614
(high-pitched voice) HMM?

06:23.614 --> 06:25.616
THUMP EACH OTHER'S JUNK.

06:25.616 --> 06:27.688
I'M SORRY. THUMP--
OHH!

06:27.688 --> 06:31.492
HE WINS.
YES! HA! IN YOURFACE!

06:31.492 --> 06:32.723
I WIN!

06:32.723 --> 06:36.467
NO, TOTALLY UNFAIR. THAT WAS
A VERY CONFUSING REQUEST!

06:36.467 --> 06:38.569
THE RULES WERE NOT MADE CLEAR.
IF SHE HAD SAID,

06:38.569 --> 06:40.631
"WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RACE,"
AND HERE'S THE GOAL,

06:40.631 --> 06:42.573
I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN READY
TO THUMP YOUR JUNK.

06:42.573 --> 06:44.705
I WOULD HAVE BEEN LASER-FOCUSED
ON YOUR JUNK.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.537
(high-pitched voice)
HA HA!

06:46.537 --> 06:47.738
(normal voice) WHATEVER, DUDE.
THE HOT GIRL IS MINE.

06:47.738 --> 06:49.640
SO YOU THINK I'M SUPPOSED
TO GO WITH HER, OR...

06:49.640 --> 06:52.743
WHO KNOWS? APPARENTLY WE'RE
JUST EMBRACING ANARCHY NOW.

06:52.743 --> 06:55.586
FREAK SHOWS AND OUTCASTS,

06:55.586 --> 06:58.649
YOU WILL NOW RECEIVE A STAMP.
DO NOT LICK IT.

06:58.649 --> 07:01.752
IT IS PURPLE, BUT IT IS NOT
FLAVORED LIKE GRAPE.
(mouths words)

07:01.752 --> 07:04.424
(bottles clink)

07:04.424 --> 07:05.425
(ringtone plays on cell phone)
(gasps)

07:05.425 --> 07:06.727
OH, THAT'S WILL! AAH!

07:06.727 --> 07:10.430
WILL! WE ARE TRAPPED
IN A POT!

07:10.430 --> 07:13.464
OH, YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S
DEFINITELY HOW PHONES WORK.

07:14.665 --> 07:18.469
HEY, I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU
KNOW THAT I GOT THE APPLE JUICE,

07:18.469 --> 07:21.441
AND, YES, IT'S ORGANIC.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.514
NO PESTICIDE HAS SOILED
THE PRECIOUS FRUIT

07:23.514 --> 07:26.517
FROM WHICH THIS NECTAR
HAS BEEN EXTRACTED.

07:26.517 --> 07:30.581
SO NEXT TIME, I HOPE YOU WON'T
QUESTION MY ABILITY TO--CRAP!

07:30.581 --> 07:32.653
NO, HEY!
THAT'S MY APPLE JUICE.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.724
OH, DUDE, THIS PLACE
IS LIKE WOODSTOCK.

07:33.724 --> 07:36.657
EVERYONE SHARES. WOULD YOU
LIKE SOME COTTON CANDY?

07:36.657 --> 07:40.491
VIRGINS
AND BASEMENT DWELLERS,

07:40.491 --> 07:42.493
ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED
YOUR HAND STAMP,

07:42.493 --> 07:44.595
YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED
INTO THE STORE

07:44.595 --> 07:46.737
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

07:46.737 --> 07:48.669
(whirring)

07:48.669 --> 07:51.672
OH, CRAP.

07:58.008 --> 07:59.880
SO AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER,

07:59.880 --> 08:02.012
BADASS DEDICATED HIMSELF
TO RIDDING THE JUNGLES

08:02.012 --> 08:03.053
OF DRUG CARTELS?

08:03.053 --> 08:04.985
AND FINDING OUT
WHO KILLED HIS DOG.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.818
OH, RIGHT. HOMER.

08:07.818 --> 08:09.760
HE LOVED THAT TRUSTY MUTT.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.723
ATTENTION,
UNLOVED BOG CREATURES,

08:12.723 --> 08:14.725
YOU WILL NOW RECEIVE
A STAMP.

08:14.725 --> 08:17.027
HEY! I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
YOU TALK TO THESE PEOPLE.

08:17.027 --> 08:19.900
EACH ONE OF THESE FAT,
LITTLE NERDS IS A HUMAN BEING.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.031
WELL,
YOU COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.

08:21.031 --> 08:23.874
(gasps) WOW.

08:23.874 --> 08:26.777
Y-YOU DEFENDED US,
JUST LIKE BADASS WOULD HAVE.

08:27.838 --> 08:29.039
HERE.

08:32.743 --> 08:33.884
YES.

08:33.884 --> 08:35.786
THIS FEELS RIGHT.

08:35.786 --> 08:38.819
(men) WHOA.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.090
HEY, WILL.

08:40.090 --> 08:42.923
IF YOU AND KENNY WERE
INTERVIEWING FOR THE SAME JOB,

08:42.923 --> 08:44.024
AND OUT OF THE BLUE,
THE INTERVIEWER SAID,

08:44.024 --> 08:46.857
"THUMP HIS JUNK," WOULD YOU
THINK THAT WAS A RACE?

08:46.857 --> 08:47.958
NO, I'D THINK I DON'T
WANT TO WORK FOR A COMPANY

08:47.958 --> 08:49.930
THAT INTERVIEWS PEOPLE
LIKE THAT.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.932
(scoffs)
HEY, DID YOU GET
YOUR HAND STAMPED YET?

08:51.932 --> 08:54.064
YES, I DID.
DAMN IT!

08:54.064 --> 08:55.866
I TOLD THERESA I WAS
GONNA GET THAT JUICE,

08:55.866 --> 08:58.008
AND NOW THAT JACKASS WON'T
LET ME BACK IN THE STORE.

08:58.008 --> 09:00.070
IT'S 11:00.
NOTHING ELSE IS OPEN,

09:00.070 --> 09:01.972
AND SHE'S GONNA KILL ME.

09:01.972 --> 09:03.043
WELL, AT LEAST YOU KNEW
THE RULES

09:03.043 --> 09:04.815
WITH WHATYOUWERE DOING.

09:04.815 --> 09:06.046
MY NIGHT HAS BEEN
ABSOLUTE CHAOS.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.818
I'VE HAD MY GENITALS THUMPED,

09:07.818 --> 09:08.949
I DID NOT CARE
FOR THAT ORGANIC APPLE JUICE,

09:08.949 --> 09:12.082
AND SOME GUY IN A GARBAGE BAG
THREW A HOT DOG AT ME.

09:12.082 --> 09:14.885
THAT'S NATHAN.
NO, THIS GUY WAS IN HIS 70s.

09:14.885 --> 09:16.757
NO, OVER THERE.
THAT'S NATHAN.

09:17.988 --> 09:21.762
(gasps)
HE SAID HE WAS SPENDING
THE NIGHT AT A FRIEND'S.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.764
HE'S NEVER LIED TO ME
BEFORE.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.937
HEY, REMEMBER THAT TIME
MY DAD SAW US AT THE QUARRY,

09:26.937 --> 09:28.769
AND HE HAD HIS BUDDIES
DRESSED UP AS COPS

09:28.769 --> 09:30.140
AND SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF US?

09:30.140 --> 09:32.042
WE SHOULD DO THAT.

09:32.042 --> 09:33.804
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THE PART
WHERE THEY MADE US

09:33.804 --> 09:34.845
DIG OUR OWN GRAVES.

09:34.845 --> 09:35.976
GOOD IDEA.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.779
SCARE 'EM STRAIGHT.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.050
BY THE WAY, I STILL FEEL BAD
THAT I BEGGED THEM

09:40.050 --> 09:41.111
TO KILL YOU FIRST.

09:41.111 --> 09:43.854
WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE,
BUDDY.

09:43.854 --> 09:45.055
HERE.

09:47.788 --> 09:48.859
HELLO.

09:48.859 --> 09:50.861
(metal rattles)
I'M THE GENTLEMAN

09:50.861 --> 09:52.993
WHO THUMPED
ANOTHER GENTLEMAN'S JUNK

09:52.993 --> 09:54.925
WITH LIGHTNING SPEED,
I MIGHT ADD. (pops lips)

09:54.925 --> 09:57.097
AND I'D LIKE TO CLAIM
MY PRIZE.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.069
THEREISNO PRIZE.

09:59.069 --> 10:01.802
BUT I WENT KNUCKLES-DEEP
IN MY FRIEND'S SQUISHY BITS.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.935
OH. I'M SORRY.
DID THAT FEEL DEGRADING?

10:04.935 --> 10:06.977
LIKE WHEN TWO PEOPLE PLAY
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS

10:06.977 --> 10:08.078
FOR ANOTHER HUMAN BEING?

10:08.078 --> 10:10.010
OHH.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.111
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.843
I'VE GOTTA GET ENOUGH
OF YOUR GEEK BRETHREN

10:12.843 --> 10:14.815
TO BUY THIS ENERGY DRINK
SO I CAN MAKE RENT.

10:14.815 --> 10:18.018
WAIT. WAIT. I'M SORRY.
LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.951
I'M A SALESMAN.
I CAN HELP YOU SELL THIS STUFF.

10:20.951 --> 10:22.122
OH, I DOUBT IT.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.154
IT TASTES LIKE SOMETHING THAT
LEAKED OUT OF AN ELEPHANT.

10:24.154 --> 10:25.996
DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PRODUCT.

10:25.996 --> 10:28.128
IT'S ABOUT MAKING THE CUSTOMER
THINK THEY NEED THE PRODUCT.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.100
LIKE RIGHT NOW I'M MAKING YOU
THINK YOU NEED ME.

10:30.100 --> 10:33.103
IT'S A BAD EXAMPLE,
BECAUSE YOUDONEED ME.

10:33.103 --> 10:34.935
OR DO YOU?

10:34.935 --> 10:37.167
THE ANSWER IS...
YOU DO.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.140
OR DO YOU?

10:40.140 --> 10:42.843
(high-pitched, singsong voice)
HELLO!

10:42.843 --> 10:43.944
(normal voice)
TALK ABOUT A BRAIN BLAST.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.046
(high-pitched voice) WHAT?
(imitates explosion)

10:46.046 --> 10:47.978
(imitates splat)

10:47.978 --> 10:49.049
UGH!

10:50.921 --> 10:52.983
OHH.

10:52.983 --> 10:56.987
WILL YOU STOP SIGHING
EVERY 15 SECONDS,PLEASE?

10:56.987 --> 10:58.929
(mocking voice) PLEASE STOP
SIGHING EVERY 15 SECONDS.

10:58.929 --> 11:00.030
YOU ARE A THIRD GRADER.

11:00.030 --> 11:01.191
I AM NOT A THIRD GRADER.

11:01.191 --> 11:02.893
WELL, YOU TEASE MY BROTHER
LIKE ONE.

11:02.893 --> 11:04.194
YOU ALSO SOMETIMES SAY
"LIBERRY"

11:04.194 --> 11:06.096
AND "GLOVE DEPARTMENT."

11:06.096 --> 11:08.098
IT IS THE DEPARTMENT WHERE
YOUR GLOVES WOULD BE FOUND.

11:08.098 --> 11:11.071
OH, MY GOD! I HAVE GOTTA
GET AWAY FROM YOU.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.103
WAIT. WHAT ABOUT LUCY?

11:13.103 --> 11:15.205
SHE'S AT A SLEEPOVER.
(sighs)

11:15.205 --> 11:19.209
OKAY, TRY AND GET MY CELL PHONE
OUT OF MY POCKET.

11:19.209 --> 11:22.012
UHH!
OW! EASY WITH THE TEETH!

11:22.012 --> 11:23.954
WOW, YOU AND KENNY
REALLYARERELATED.

11:23.954 --> 11:25.185
UGH.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.217
SO I WANT ALL OF YOU
TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELVES,

11:27.217 --> 11:30.891
EVEN IF YOUR PARENTS HAVE
PRETTY MUCH GIVEN UP ON YOU.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.896
HERE, SIR. I MADE THIS SHOTGUN
OUT OF A MOP.

11:38.128 --> 11:39.269
(click)

11:39.269 --> 11:43.904
(cheering)

11:43.904 --> 11:46.036
HEY, GRANT.

11:46.036 --> 11:48.138
NATHAN'S HERE,
AND I WANNA TEACH HIM A LESSON.

11:48.138 --> 11:50.110
WE NEED DISGUISES.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.042
MUCH LIKE
MY VIDEO GAME PERSONA,

11:52.042 --> 11:53.243
I BELIEVE IN TEACHING
MORAL LESSONS

11:53.243 --> 11:55.085
TO THE YOUTH OF AMERICA.

11:56.146 --> 11:59.249
YOU TWO...
GIVE THEM YOUR CLOTHES.

12:05.155 --> 12:07.297
SO WE DRAW NATHAN
INTO A CONVERSATION.

12:07.297 --> 12:10.200
WE GET HIM TO ADMIT
THAT HE LIED TO HIS PARENTS,

12:10.200 --> 12:11.261
AND THEN WE SCARE
THE PANTS OFF HIM

12:11.261 --> 12:13.003
TO MAKE SURE
HE NEVER DOES IT AGAIN.

12:13.003 --> 12:15.205
YEAH, AND THEN WE TELL 'EM
TO DIG THEIR OWN GRAVES.

12:15.205 --> 12:16.967
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT,

12:16.967 --> 12:18.939
ALL RIGHT, BUT THATIS
THE PART WE STILL TALK ABOUT.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.040
(speaking inaudibly)

12:20.040 --> 12:22.943
(Irish brogue)
AH, WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

12:22.943 --> 12:25.045
COUPLE OF LADDIES
UP TO NO GOOD, EH?

12:25.045 --> 12:26.146
(under breath)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:26.146 --> 12:27.317
(normal voice, under breath)
I'M SORRY.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.320
(deep voice) SO, BOYS,

12:30.320 --> 12:32.052
YOUR PARENTS
KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

12:34.084 --> 12:37.127
NO! NO, THEY DON'T.
IT WAS SCOTT'S IDEA.

12:37.127 --> 12:39.329
WELL, LOOK HOW QUICKLY
THE KEENS GIVE UP THEIR FRIENDS.

12:39.329 --> 12:42.993
I'M A LIAR.
I-I-I LIED TO MY PARENTS.

12:42.993 --> 12:45.295
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON. I...
I DON'T KNOW. (hyperventilating)

12:45.295 --> 12:47.297
EASY KID. CALM DOWN.

12:47.297 --> 12:50.040
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CRASHED
THE REAL ESTATE MARKET.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.241
I'M CALLING MY DAD.
I GOTTA COME CLEAN.

12:51.241 --> 12:54.975
UH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T CALL YOUR DAD.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.176
UH, I-I THINK YOU LEARNED
YOUR LESSON.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.247
(cell phone ringing)
UH... OH, WELL,

12:57.247 --> 12:59.209
I'M GETTING
A COINCIDENTAL CALL,

12:59.209 --> 13:01.251
SO, UH, I GOTTA...

13:01.251 --> 13:02.252
DAD?

13:02.252 --> 13:04.254
UH...

13:07.117 --> 13:08.288
(bang)
ALL OF YOU!

13:08.288 --> 13:11.261
GET ON YOUR KNEES! YOU'RE GONNA
DIG YOUR OWN GRAVES.

13:11.261 --> 13:14.264
CRAIG!
I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE IT MEMORABLE.

13:20.170 --> 13:22.002
FIRST I GET A "B" ON MY TEST,
THEN I SNEAK OUT AT NIGHT.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.103
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

13:23.103 --> 13:24.975
NATHAN, WHAT YOU DID
WAS WRONG,

13:24.975 --> 13:27.307
BUT YOU'RE A GOOD KID,
AND YOUR MOM'S RIGHT.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.980
YOU'VE GOTTA LIGHTEN UP
A LITTLE,

13:29.980 --> 13:31.281
NOT TAKE EVERYTHING
SO SERIOUSLY.

13:31.281 --> 13:33.113
YOU TAKE THINGS SERIOUSLY.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.185
OH. (scoffs) ME? ME?

13:36.216 --> 13:39.019
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. I DO.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.291
I TAKE THINGS
VERY SERIOUSLY.

13:41.291 --> 13:43.123
LIKE TONIGHT,

13:43.123 --> 13:45.055
INSTEAD OF HAVING FUN,
I'VE BEEN DRIVING MYSELF CRAZY

13:45.055 --> 13:47.357
TRYING TO GET APPLE JUICE
FOR YOUR MOM'S SOCCER PARTY.

13:47.357 --> 13:50.300
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOT ANYMORE.

13:50.300 --> 13:53.133
TONIGHT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
WORRY ABOUT GRADES OR LYING,

13:53.133 --> 13:56.136
AND I'M NOT GONNA WORRY
ABOUT THAT APPLE JUICE.

13:57.367 --> 14:01.171
ACTUALLY, NO. I HAVE GOT
TO GET THAT APPLE JUICE.

14:01.171 --> 14:03.243
IS--IS YOUR HAND STAMPED?

14:03.243 --> 14:04.344
YEAH, BUT THERE'S A WAY
THAT YOU CAN SNEAK IN

14:04.344 --> 14:06.076
THROUGH THE GARDEN CENTER.

14:06.076 --> 14:07.277
I DID THAT TO USE
THE BATHROOMS.

14:07.277 --> 14:10.280
THOSE PORTA-POTTIES
ARE EGREGIOUS.
SHOW ME.

14:11.321 --> 14:14.254
THE GARDEN CENTER,
NOT THE PORTA-POTTIES.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.356
(coughs)

14:16.356 --> 14:19.159
WHAT IS THIS STUFF?

14:19.159 --> 14:21.231
IT'S GAMER FUEL, SPECIFICALLY
FORMULATED TO HELP GAMERS

14:21.231 --> 14:23.233
SHARPEN THEIR SENSES
AND HEIGHTEN THEIR MOTOR SKILLS.

14:23.233 --> 14:25.295
IT TASTES LIKE
A FISH BARFED.

14:25.295 --> 14:29.299
NO, IT DOESN'T.

14:29.299 --> 14:34.044
(exhales deeply)
WHAT IS THAT FRESHNESS?

14:34.044 --> 14:35.375
WONDERFUL JUICE!

14:35.375 --> 14:39.179
YOU KNOW WHAT? NEVER MIND.
YOU CLEARLY CAN'T HANDLE THIS.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.151
LET'S GO FIND SOME GAMERS
WHO ARE SERIOUS

14:41.151 --> 14:43.113
ABOUT TAKING THIS
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

14:43.113 --> 14:44.184
SEE YA, POSEURS.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.285
WAIT!

14:47.257 --> 14:49.389
WE'RE SERIOUS GAMERS.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.162
DON'T YOU WASTE MY TIME.

14:52.162 --> 14:54.224
SO WHEN WE GET
TO THE BASEMENT DOOR,

14:54.224 --> 14:56.296
WE'LL JUST HANG IT
OVER THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

14:56.296 --> 14:58.168
AND LET IT SLIP OFF.

14:58.168 --> 15:00.070
OH.
OH, LET ME GUESS.

15:00.070 --> 15:02.232
YOU HAVE A LIST OF REASONS
WHY MY IDEA IS BAD.

15:02.232 --> 15:04.204
NOPE. NOT ALLOWED
TO MAKE ANY SUGGESTIONS

15:04.204 --> 15:07.277
THAT COULD POSSIBLY
HELP IMPROVE YOUR LIFE.

15:07.277 --> 15:11.211
SO LET'S JUST TRY YOUR STUPID,
DANGEROUS, ILL-CONCEIVED IDEA.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.214
HEY, THERESA, GUESS WHICH FINGER
I'M HOLDING UP IN THIS POT.

15:16.286 --> 15:18.088
AHH!

15:18.088 --> 15:22.152
(both grunting)

15:22.152 --> 15:23.253
OH, YEAH,
THIS IS GONNA WORK.

15:23.253 --> 15:24.354
TRUST ME. I'M A NURSE.

15:24.354 --> 15:25.425
YOU NEED TO LEARN THAT

15:25.425 --> 15:28.328
THAT'S NOT RELEVANT
TO EVERY SITUATION, BRENDA.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.400
READY?

15:30.400 --> 15:31.401
ONE, TWO...

15:31.401 --> 15:33.163
(both scream)

15:33.163 --> 15:35.105
(thud, crashing)

15:35.105 --> 15:40.110
(panting) OKAY. NOW IT'S
RELEVANT THAT YOU'RE A NURSE.

15:40.110 --> 15:41.111
UHH!

15:45.275 --> 15:48.448
WE GOTTA STAY LOW HERE AND MAKE
A LEFT AT THE SUCCULENTS.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.250
GO.

16:01.391 --> 16:02.462
AAH!

16:02.462 --> 16:05.135
(spits)

16:05.135 --> 16:06.296
(lowered voice)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:06.296 --> 16:08.338
THINK I'D LET YOU
DO THIS ALONE?

16:08.338 --> 16:10.270
YOU'RE IN MY WORLD NOW.

16:12.142 --> 16:14.404
NO.
I WAS HERE LAST SATURDAY.

16:14.404 --> 16:17.147
I NEEDED A FERN
FOR MY BATHROOM.

16:21.451 --> 16:26.186
(whirring)

16:30.160 --> 16:31.291
(thud)
OHH!

16:31.291 --> 16:33.493
(grunts)
JEEZ!

16:33.493 --> 16:37.497
OH! THE EYE PATCH
KILLS YOUR DEPTH PERCEPTION.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.229
(whirring)

16:39.229 --> 16:40.370
THERE'S THAT SECURITY GUARD.

16:40.370 --> 16:43.533
(whirring continues)

16:43.533 --> 16:45.235
I THINK HE SAW US!
WE SHOULD GO,

16:45.235 --> 16:47.177
WE SHOULD GO, WE SHOULD GO,
WE SHOULD GO, WE SHOULD GO.

16:47.177 --> 16:48.508
DAD, IF YOU GUYS CREATE
A DIVERSION,

16:48.508 --> 16:51.181
I THINK I CAN SNEAK
THROUGH THERE

16:51.181 --> 16:54.184
AND GET TO THE APPLE JUICE.
NATHAN, THAT'S SUICIDE,

16:54.184 --> 16:55.315
OR AT LEAST VERY DIFFICULT.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.417
I KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE.
YOU ARE SURROUNDED

16:57.417 --> 16:59.419
BY SECURITY CAMERAS
WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE ON

16:59.419 --> 17:01.291
DUE TO COST-CUTTING MEASURES.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.293
DAD, IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

17:03.293 --> 17:04.524
TELL MOM I LOVE HER.

17:04.524 --> 17:09.199
(inhales deeply)
JUST GET THAT APPLE JUICE.

17:09.199 --> 17:10.200
WAIT.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.201
(click)

17:11.201 --> 17:13.203
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SLIP.

17:21.411 --> 17:22.512
MAKE SURE IT'S ORGANIC,

17:22.512 --> 17:25.215
IN 6-OUNCE BOTTLES.

17:25.215 --> 17:27.447
THE FUTURE OF OUR FAMILY
DEPENDS ON IT!

17:27.447 --> 17:30.220
(high-pitched voice) CAW-CAW!
CAW-CAW! CAW-CAW! CAW-CAW!

17:30.220 --> 17:31.281
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
A DIVERSION.

17:41.531 --> 17:44.234
(roars in slow-motion voice)

17:44.234 --> 17:45.395
(thud)

17:45.395 --> 17:47.537
(Muzak playing)

17:47.537 --> 17:49.399
(coughing)

17:49.399 --> 17:51.341
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

17:51.341 --> 17:53.303
WHY WOULD YOU TACKLE US?

17:53.303 --> 17:55.405
NO, NO, I AGREE.
I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

17:55.405 --> 17:57.507
I RIPPED MY PANTS.

17:57.507 --> 17:59.449
THESE WERE
MY MOTHER'S PANTS.

17:59.449 --> 18:01.411
OH, THEY WERE A GIFT
FROM MY MOTHER,

18:01.411 --> 18:02.452
BUT STILL,
IT'S UPSETTING.

18:02.452 --> 18:04.314
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

18:04.314 --> 18:05.585
YOU DO KNOW THIS IS A COSTUME,
RIGHT?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.287
I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED
IN MYSELF.

18:08.518 --> 18:10.520
I THINK I GOTTA LIE DOWN
SOMEWHERE.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.362
I THINK--I DON'T--

18:12.362 --> 18:14.364
I THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

18:16.626 --> 18:18.498
OOH! OOH, OOH!

18:18.498 --> 18:20.470
I THINK ENOUGH FEELING
HAS COME BACK TO MY HANDS

18:20.470 --> 18:23.273
THAT I CAN PICK UP
MY GLASS OF WINE!

18:23.273 --> 18:25.335
LOOK AT THAT. OH!

18:25.335 --> 18:26.536
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST KNOCK
MINE ONTO THE TABLE

18:26.536 --> 18:28.308
AND LAP IT UP.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.280
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVEN'T
DONE THAT BEFORE.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.482
(laughs) OKAY, I ADMIT,

18:32.482 --> 18:36.346
MAYBE I AM GUILTY SOMETIMES
OF TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO.

18:39.649 --> 18:41.591
THAT PAUSE WAS SO THAT
YOU COULD COP TO SOMETHING

18:41.591 --> 18:42.652
YOU'RE GUILTY OF.

18:42.652 --> 18:44.494
OKAY.

18:44.494 --> 18:47.497
I'M JUST WORRIED THAT
IF THINGS WITH YOU AND KENNY

18:47.497 --> 18:49.329
GOT REALLY BAD, HE'S FAMILY,

18:49.329 --> 18:51.431
SO IF I EVER HAD
TO CHOOSE SIDES...

18:51.431 --> 18:53.563
I GET IT.

18:53.563 --> 18:55.435
IT'S JUST
HE'S SO DARN TORTUREABLE.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.536
(sighs)

18:56.536 --> 18:58.638
I MEAN, HE IS A 36-YEAR-OLD MAN
AFRAID OF GHOSTS.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.442
BUT I'LL LAY OFF HIM...

19:02.442 --> 19:03.513
A LITTLE.

19:03.513 --> 19:04.674
THANK YOU.

19:04.674 --> 19:07.677
AND I'LL STOP TELLING YOU
WHAT TO DO.
(chuckles)

19:07.677 --> 19:10.620
IF YOU STOP PRETENDING
TO SEE GHOSTS AROUND KENNY.

19:12.382 --> 19:13.383
(clink)

19:15.325 --> 19:17.427
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LET HIM
GO ALONE.

19:17.427 --> 19:18.458
(sighs)

19:19.629 --> 19:21.331
HEY!
COME ON!

19:21.331 --> 19:22.532
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH!
YES!

19:22.532 --> 19:24.434
HEY!

19:24.434 --> 19:25.665
(all)
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

19:25.665 --> 19:28.438
YOU FORGOT YOUR CHANGE,
SWEETIE.

19:28.438 --> 19:29.469
THANKS.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.601
(laughs)

19:31.601 --> 19:33.343
(laughs)

19:33.343 --> 19:35.345
THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN.

19:35.345 --> 19:38.348
OH, I'M PROUD OF YOU, NATE.

19:43.483 --> 19:46.386
I NEED MORE BRAIN BLAST.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.518
ACTUALLY, THAT'S IT.
YOU SOLD IT ALL.

19:48.518 --> 19:51.491
OH. UH...

19:51.491 --> 19:54.424
SO I GUESS I'LL JUST...
TAKE OFF THEN?

19:54.424 --> 19:58.428
I... REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR HELP. THANKS.

20:00.370 --> 20:01.631
BYE.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.435
OKAY.

20:05.435 --> 20:06.576
HI! I'M KIM.

20:06.576 --> 20:08.538
ARE TO TRY A SAMPLE
OF THE HOT, NEW ENERGY DRINK?

20:08.538 --> 20:09.709
HEY, KIM.

20:11.441 --> 20:13.383
I GOT DIBS ON THAT GUY.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.650
OKAY.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.392
YOU CAN CALL ME.

20:22.392 --> 20:25.625
REALLY?
OH, MY HEART IS RACING.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.528
BUT IT MIGHT JUST BE
FROM THAT POISON-IN-A-CAN

20:28.528 --> 20:30.430
WE'VE BEEN SELLING.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.432
NO, IT'S YOU.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.464
(beep)

20:40.670 --> 20:43.473
ATTENTION,
MORONS AND HUMAN COMPOST.

20:43.473 --> 20:45.645
THESE THREE GENTLEMEN
ARE GUILTY

20:45.645 --> 20:46.746
OF SNEAKING
INTO THE GARDEN CENTER.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.549
THEY WILL NOW COME WITH ME
AND BE RETAINED

20:49.549 --> 20:51.621
FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE EVENING.

20:51.621 --> 20:53.483
WHAT IF WE DON'T WANNA
COME WITH YOU?

20:53.483 --> 20:58.728
THEN I SHALL INSIST AGAIN
IN A HARSHER TONE.

20:58.728 --> 21:00.530
YOU HAVE NO POWER, DO YOU?

21:00.530 --> 21:01.661
NO, NO, NO.
BUP, BUP, BUP, BUP, BUP.

21:01.661 --> 21:04.434
(under breath) DON'T DO THAT.
SERIOUSLY. PLEASE?

21:04.434 --> 21:05.565
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.667
WE'RE COOL, RIGHT?

21:07.667 --> 21:10.700
NO, WE'RE NOT COOL! ALL NIGHT,
YOU HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE--

21:10.700 --> 21:14.544
(loudly) IT IS SETTLED, THEN!
WE HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT.

21:14.544 --> 21:15.645
I WILL BESTOW MERCY
UPON THEM

21:15.645 --> 21:18.508
AND LET THEM OFF
WITH A WRITTEN WARNING.

21:20.750 --> 21:22.652
THIS IS
A BLANK "MAD LIBS" SHEET.
