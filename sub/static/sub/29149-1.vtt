saw the busted fence

32:22.587 --> 32:24.255

32:24.256 --> 32:25.757

32:25.758 --> 32:27.992
an entry keycard was
found and passed to me.

32:27.993 --> 32:30.628
So, that's one individual
outside of our loop,

32:30.629 --> 32:32.987

32:32.988 --> 32:34.044

divers in that morning.

32:36.983 --> 32:39.837
And the kid, uh, Andrew Dodds,
well, he was dead obviously.

32:39.838 --> 32:42.339
He'd unclipped his seatbelt,
so he had survived the impact

32:42.340 --> 32:43.641
to do that.

32:43.642 --> 32:44.727
Oh, okay.

32:44.728 --> 32:47.778
So, the initial determination
was that he was travelling solo

32:47.779 --> 32:49.279
and that hasn't been challenged.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.548
And the riverbank was
also heavily compromised

32:51.549 --> 32:53.984
by rain and our guys and
the salvage operation,

32:53.985 --> 32:57.053
so there were no indicators
of another individual.

What? I have to dance for the Daddy too?

36:55.120 --> 36:58.054
I've had strong advice
to accept the offer.

What if I didn't know what I think?

37:03.295 --> 37:04.360
Uh-huh.

37:05.163 --> 37:06.931
Maybe you should sell.

You're old. You've not been well.

TOM WAMSGANS: So, what's
the game do you reckon, Shiv?

37:59.316 --> 38:02.586
I dunno. Say he's selling
and see who squeals loudest?

38:02.587 --> 38:06.122
Kind of loyalty test? Or
productivity brainstorm?

We need to discuss this bear hug.

Obviously, I have obligations
to the shareholders

to seriously consider it. Ha-ha.

Now Kendall's row-back may
have hurt them, we'll see.

38:45.228 --> 38:47.329
It may kill the bid, it may not.

38:47.330 --> 38:51.066
But I guess the question
that that's been put to me is

38:51.067 --> 38:53.669
do we really want this fight?

38:53.670 --> 38:59.173
Or is now the moment to cash in
and fuck off out of the casino?

38:59.843 --> 39:02.744

39:04.080 --> 39:09.450
I need to tell the board

Sandy and Stewy want?

shutter the businesses that burn cash,

step down in a year?

I'll sell my shares. Yeah,
I'll join Sandy and Stewy.

having this conversation.

What is that? Is that real?

48:35.206 --> 48:37.407

having this conversation anyway,

49:02.465 --> 49:04.232
then yeah, fine, sell.

49:04.868 --> 49:07.002
Fine, I'll do it.

49:08.038 --> 49:09.170
Right now.

49:13.209 --> 49:17.845
I'll tweet, the markets will
move, and that'll be that.

49:18.548 --> 49:19.714
Bullshit.

49:19.715 --> 49:21.849

49:25.087 --> 49:27.221

49:36.466 --> 49:37.565
Yes.

49:39.769 --> 49:43.238

interested. If it's real.

49:43.239 --> 49:44.439
This is real.

49:44.440 --> 49:47.440
Yes, of course. Dad, I can do it.

49:49.712 --> 49:51.812
I could... I would...

Why did you never ask me, huh?

49:56.185 --> 49:58.485
I would kill this.
I'd fucking destroy it!

Well, we're gonna need to talk about it.

50:37.226 --> 50:39.927
For now, we need to
keep this between us.

50:39.928 --> 50:41.696
I gotta think about Tom, Gil...

50:41.697 --> 50:44.832
Of course. We have to think
about the choreography anyway.

50:44.833 --> 50:47.735

you know, fast track you.

have the experience...

- Uh, Napoleonica.

51:18.966 --> 51:20.300

51:20.301 --> 51:22.435

pickled in a jar, or... ?

It's dried. Yeah, really
not much to see now-a-days.

51:49.173 --> 51:51.798
Yeah, it's kinda like, what,
like a strip of beef jerky?

51:51.799 --> 51:54.400
Yeah, it's a mere trifle,
historically speaking.

51:54.401 --> 51:57.536

Get that and Hitler's nutsack?

take-over-Europe smoothie?

52:01.574 --> 52:04.143
Yeah, cool. He offered me the company.

52:04.144 --> 52:05.444
I told him to, uh,

52:05.445 --> 52:08.046
send you to look at pineapple
production in Honduras.

52:08.047 --> 52:10.272

- Where am I going?

when I set a 200K ceiling

bag of live raccoons

And maybe you'll kill him,

01:00:30.976 --> 01:00:32.543
but if you don't, he aims to kill you.

01:00:32.544 --> 01:00:34.512
He will go bankrupt or go to jail

01:00:34.513 --> 01:00:35.880
before he lets you beat him.

01:00:35.881 --> 01:00:38.315
He will kill you on the business
and if that doesn't work,

01:00:38.316 --> 01:00:40.050
he will send people around.

01:00:40.051 --> 01:00:42.786
He will send men to kill
your pets and fuck your wives,

01:00:42.787 --> 01:00:45.555
and it will never be over,
so that's the message.

01:00:48.001 --> 01:00:49.335
Good.

01:00:49.336 --> 01:00:53.038
Well, let's move ahead
with that process, shall we?

Dad, this isn't the time to retreat.

It makes us look weak.

01:02:24.894 --> 01:02:26.994
No. It makes us look ruthless.

Dad announces tomorrow, he announces me.

01:02:30.236 --> 01:02:32.160
Unless there is one other.

The compass points to
Pennsylvania Avenue.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:47.853
wouldn't proceed with
their bid without you,

public with a bear hug.

01:02:50.871 --> 01:02:53.538
- You could stop it.
- KENDALL ROY: Okay, yeah.

01:02:53.539 --> 01:02:55.062
My dad wants me to do it.

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:56.680

JESSE ARMSTRONG: The first
episode of this second season,

01:02:59.205 --> 01:03:02.804
it follows on like 36, 48 hours

01:03:02.805 --> 01:03:05.417
after the events of the first season.

01:03:05.418 --> 01:03:08.168
And we were interested,
how does it feel to wake up

01:03:08.169 --> 01:03:10.060
after what Kendall's gone through?

01:03:10.061 --> 01:03:12.301
What does his face look like,
what's his body look like?

01:03:12.302 --> 01:03:13.618
What's he gonna say to people?

01:03:13.619 --> 01:03:15.543
REPORTER: Now, Kendall,
tell us what happened.

01:03:15.544 --> 01:03:17.680
Why did you get involved?
Why did you back out?

01:03:17.681 --> 01:03:21.705
The long and the short of
it is, I... saw their plan.

01:03:21.706 --> 01:03:23.292
And my dad's plan was better.

01:03:23.293 --> 01:03:25.151
ARMSTRONG: The interest of the show

01:03:25.152 --> 01:03:27.760
is seeing these people
go through their stuff.

01:03:27.761 --> 01:03:29.702
And they go through
quite a bit of stuff.

01:03:29.703 --> 01:03:31.245
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:03:31.903 --> 01:03:35.653
the first fucking thing my son's
ever done right in his life.

01:03:35.993 --> 01:03:37.392
In the scene where...

01:03:37.393 --> 01:03:39.543
Logan talks about the
future of the company...

01:03:39.544 --> 01:03:42.192
LOGAN ROY: We need to
discuss this bear hug.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:44.318
Stick, or sell?

01:03:45.794 --> 01:03:47.876
ARMSTRONG: People will have
to decide whether they think

01:03:47.877 --> 01:03:50.068
he is setting the table

01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:51.885
for the discussion he has with his kids

01:03:51.886 --> 01:03:52.994
in a frank way.

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.663
Or if he's loading the dice.

01:03:55.418 --> 01:03:57.377

Come on, we're all pals here.

01:04:02.418 --> 01:04:04.126
- SHIV ROY: Oh, yeah.
- Let's fucking have it out.

01:04:04.127 --> 01:04:08.110
I fucking love money, but
I'm really scared of you.

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:09.719
So... (WHIMPERS)

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.417
ARMSTRONG: Logan wants a family legacy.

01:04:12.418 --> 01:04:14.876
When he looks at Roman, I don't
think he sees it there tomorrow.

01:04:14.877 --> 01:04:17.568
And his son has both betrayed him

01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:21.259
and also been in circumstances
which make him seem

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:23.209
like not a good candidate right now.

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:25.144
And Connor, I think
he would laugh about.

01:04:25.145 --> 01:04:28.668
So Shiv feels like, "Well that's
what he's gonna do, right?"

01:04:28.669 --> 01:04:30.026
It seemed obvious to us.

01:04:30.027 --> 01:04:32.009
What I've decided I'd like to do,

01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:33.927
is to formally ask you

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:35.750
to come in...

01:04:36.245 --> 01:04:39.079
and be the next chief
executive of this company.

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:43.985
It nearly made my cry seeing
Shiv sort of finally say

01:04:43.986 --> 01:04:45.376
what she has always wanted.

01:04:45.377 --> 01:04:47.693
I think there's some things
in life that you don't

01:04:47.694 --> 01:04:51.126
almost even know you
want until you say it.

01:04:51.127 --> 01:04:53.442
And then it can be quite
powerful and overwhelming,

01:04:53.443 --> 01:04:55.051
the acceptance of it.

01:04:55.052 --> 01:04:56.219
