A Chinese plane got shot down
over the mountains

21:29.808 --> 21:31.684
near a hell-hole called Gasak.

21:31.769 --> 21:33.269
Yeah? Who shot it down?

21:33.354 --> 21:34.938
Take a guess.

21:37.816 --> 21:40.860
Onboard that plane is a safe carrying
something you don't need to know about.

21:40.945 --> 21:44.322
All you need to know is
you can't let it fall into the wrong hands.

21:44.406 --> 21:45.406
Now, you're gonna go in there,

21:45.491 --> 21:47.867
and you're gonna get the contents
of that safe before anyone else.

21:47.952 --> 21:49.035
You're gonna bring it to me.

21:49.119 --> 21:51.412
It should be a walk in the park for you.

21:51.497 --> 21:52.956
And then we're even.

21:53.457 --> 21:54.958
We'll get to that.

Her name is Maggie Chang.

22:18.232 --> 22:19.273

22:19.358 --> 22:21.567

with the name Maggie, yeah.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.238
She can handle herself.

22:25.322 --> 22:27.156

If anything happens to her,
she gets a hangnail,

23:56.371 --> 23:57.830

We don't know what to expect.

24:06.590 --> 24:08.216
Is it custom?

24:10.761 --> 24:13.012
I think it's a mistake, you coming along.

24:13.931 --> 24:15.306
Build it yourself?

24:16.767 --> 24:19.685
Yeah, I built it myself.
Are you playing games with me, Maggie?

24:20.104 --> 24:23.981
No. Are you playing games with me?

24:24.608 --> 24:26.234
Church told me what you said.

24:26.318 --> 24:29.654

I don't need a babysitter.

- All right.

26:56.510 --> 26:59.887
I was trained as a sniper,
and an instructor, too,

26:59.972 --> 27:03.641
but I actually wanted to mix it up,
get in on the action.

27:04.893 --> 27:07.770
Uh, this one time, we're stuck out
in this hell-hole valley.

27:08.397 --> 27:12.525
About 30 Taliban opened up
from these houses in the hills above us.

27:12.609 --> 27:14.694
And they got about eight of us
pinned down bad.

27:14.778 --> 27:18.656
So I called in for artillery support.
But, "No way," says the captain.

27:19.032 --> 27:21.033
Didn't wanna endanger the locals.

27:21.118 --> 27:26.706

some to the dry riverbed and the rest bailed.

41:04.271 --> 41:08.482
The Russians stored nearly 5 tons
of weapons-grade plutonium.

The mine was abandoned after the Cold War.
No one knows it's there.
