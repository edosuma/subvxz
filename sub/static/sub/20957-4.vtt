<i>Previously on "Wynonna Earp"...</i>

00:02.102 --> 00:03.695
- Wynonna!
- The girl everyone's scared of.

00:03.719 --> 00:07.488
I just can't stop seeing it. Gory ritual,
broken seal, Black Badge owns us.

00:07.490 --> 00:11.174
- Hey, how's the demotion going?
- Kill me a demon already.

00:11.213 --> 00:12.846
You've been cooking drugs for Dolls?

00:12.848 --> 00:14.169
Suffice it to say,
there is an effort afoot

00:14.193 --> 00:17.723
which requires a demon's blood
in its purest form.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.005
Not in uniform! OK? Not in public!

00:20.067 --> 00:22.601
<i>Have you noticed any changes
in Waverly lately?</i>

00:22.603 --> 00:24.603
<i>She's become cruel.</i>

00:24.605 --> 00:27.371
- You sure you're OK?
- Better put that somewhere safe.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.809
Waves!

01:40.046 --> 01:42.228
You can't sleep in winter
without three duvets,

01:42.274 --> 01:44.603
now you're out here in your nightgown?

01:45.404 --> 01:47.504
Hey. What are... what are we doing...?

01:47.696 --> 01:49.527
Looking for breakfast?

01:50.777 --> 01:52.964
Right. You never know when might find

01:52.997 --> 01:55.932
a rabid case of waffles
in the wild?

01:58.508 --> 02:01.023
I must've been... sleep walking?

02:01.148 --> 02:03.779
You couldn't have developed
this fun new habit in July?

02:08.935 --> 02:11.060
Hey. It's OK.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.709
We'll start doublelocking
the front door.

02:16.530 --> 02:19.161
Can we just go inside?
I'm freezing my butt off.

02:21.671 --> 02:24.124
Well, come on! Now you're
the one without a coat.

02:48.901 --> 02:50.525
Wynonna...

03:01.537 --> 03:03.115
Bathroom?

03:08.500 --> 03:10.031
You totally have to pay for that.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.570
You know what I want.

03:44.356 --> 03:47.239
- That was rude.
- I wasn't expecting company.

03:47.256 --> 03:48.630
We'll be taking that briefcase.

03:48.685 --> 03:50.764
Yeah, I lose this case, I lose my job.

03:50.796 --> 03:52.647
And there's a foosball table
in my office.

03:52.803 --> 03:56.057
- Black Badge does like to play games.
- This isn't a game.

03:56.082 --> 03:57.330
Give it.

03:57.409 --> 03:58.870
They make sure I can't do that.

03:58.932 --> 04:02.034
And no, I don't have the combination.

04:19.149 --> 04:21.095
I would say hand it over,

04:21.283 --> 04:23.885
but you might not like what that means.

04:29.191 --> 04:33.081
Cujo, pay the lady for her troubles.
And the pastry.

04:33.769 --> 04:35.563
We're not savages.

05:01.258 --> 05:03.791
- Aramaic?
- Syriac?

05:03.877 --> 05:06.252
- Assyrian?
- Assholery?

05:06.396 --> 05:07.979
That is totally not a thing.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.002
YuhAssholery.

05:10.042 --> 05:13.145
That seal is an asshole,
broken by an asshole

05:13.200 --> 05:15.676
who let an asshole
crawl out of it. Assholery.

05:15.746 --> 05:17.950
Speaking of assholes...

05:18.274 --> 05:19.474
I got something.

05:19.476 --> 05:21.336
There's a cream for that.

05:21.415 --> 05:25.032
A briefcase was stolen, from a
Field Marshall, in the Triangle.

05:25.180 --> 05:26.836
And you're happy about that?

05:26.884 --> 05:29.127
Dude. Course she is.
She retrieves the briefcase

05:29.152 --> 05:31.334
and snuggles so far back up
Moody's puckerbutt...

05:31.388 --> 05:34.422
That he has to reassign me.
Sayonara, Hellhole.

05:34.424 --> 05:36.287
I really wish you'd give
Purgatory a chance.

05:36.312 --> 05:37.758
It really is a very nice place.

05:37.835 --> 05:40.163
And we're this close to getting
a vegetarian restaurant.

05:42.879 --> 05:44.855
I... I could use your help.

05:44.942 --> 05:47.223
We get in, we get out, with backup.

05:47.344 --> 05:49.496
Hard pass. Whatever broke that
seal is about to rear

05:49.521 --> 05:51.747
its fugly head and I'm going to
be there to punch the mother...

05:51.749 --> 05:53.207
- I'll go.
- What?

05:53.503 --> 05:55.484
I need someone who can work recon.

05:55.486 --> 05:57.374
OK, I haven't told anyone this,

05:57.742 --> 05:59.688
but I've been looking into spy schools.

05:59.765 --> 06:02.240
- There are no...
- Such thing as spy schools,

06:02.265 --> 06:05.249
I know. But I'd be good! I know it.

06:05.382 --> 06:07.629
I'm super bendy, so small spaces
aren't a thing.

06:07.691 --> 06:11.300
I can speak four languages
fluently, and I was once

06:11.354 --> 06:13.809
hit by a tranquilizer dart
and still went to band practice.

06:15.957 --> 06:17.983
It would be a good case
for her to cut her teeth on.

06:18.007 --> 06:20.624
- No way!
- It's a big one, Earp.

06:20.778 --> 06:23.145
We'll have backup. Real backup.

06:28.487 --> 06:30.222
Alright, you're in.

06:30.706 --> 06:32.354
- Come on in and I'll brief you.
- OK!

06:32.378 --> 06:34.956
- Yay! I'm getting briefed!
- Careful. It might just mean

06:35.011 --> 06:36.886
- she's taking your underpants.
- Well, actually...

06:36.910 --> 06:38.581
Yeah, I know she's not
taking her underpants,

06:38.605 --> 06:40.605
close your mouth, Jeremy.

06:40.738 --> 06:42.136
Focus on the seal.

06:42.137 --> 06:43.576
I have to go break one of my own.

06:43.855 --> 06:46.355
Way too much coffee.

06:49.406 --> 06:51.707
The heat is breaching two-
twelve. You're burning it.

06:51.709 --> 06:54.350
This isn't moonshine.
We're mixing volatile elements

06:54.413 --> 06:56.378
with genie blood.
It needs to be hotter than Hell.

06:56.380 --> 06:58.180
Yeah, well just don't
go blowing up my bar,

06:58.241 --> 06:59.569
because I extorted good money for it.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.968
Is there anybody around here
you haven't blackmailed?

07:02.052 --> 07:04.519
All for a noble cause...

07:05.190 --> 07:06.722
Doc, no!

07:10.739 --> 07:13.007
Thunderation!

07:15.265 --> 07:17.173
You are a woman of unexpected talents.

07:17.696 --> 07:19.902
I nearly burn my skin off and you think

07:19.904 --> 07:22.064
- that is this funny?
- It's just...

07:22.407 --> 07:24.167
"Thunderation."

07:25.441 --> 07:26.825
Let me see.

07:27.775 --> 07:30.667
Nothing a little aloe can't cure.

07:33.082 --> 07:35.042
That's one hell of a life line.

07:39.573 --> 07:42.088
Yeah, well, I may have time
but Dolls does not.

07:42.159 --> 07:44.660
Yeah. The drugs will get done.
Whether he's strong enough...

07:44.662 --> 07:48.012
You never mind about that. He
will survive this. He must.

07:50.311 --> 07:53.006
Dude. That supposed to resemble a pizza?

07:53.103 --> 07:55.654
Yeah, it gets worse: It's glutenfree.

07:56.140 --> 07:57.686
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

07:57.975 --> 07:59.544
It almost tastes like real cheese.

08:00.068 --> 08:02.875
No, I'm sorry.

08:03.544 --> 08:07.037
That... weirdness in Waverly

08:07.039 --> 08:08.405
you were trying to... yeah,

08:08.407 --> 08:11.016
I'm kind of finally noticing now.

08:11.143 --> 08:13.227
I can't betray her trust.

08:13.539 --> 08:15.586
I... I would never ask you to.

08:16.008 --> 08:18.188
But... yeah.

08:18.528 --> 08:20.140
Waverly's...

08:20.381 --> 08:22.796
struggling a little with who she is.

08:22.889 --> 08:24.722
That struggle is going to get her hurt.

08:24.820 --> 08:27.892
- I mean, going undercover for Lucado?
- What?

08:27.953 --> 08:29.801
Mhm. Not to mention

08:29.896 --> 08:32.043
the shortdecisions, rash tempers,

08:32.105 --> 08:34.784
- sleepwalking...
- Sleepwalking? In the winter?

08:34.863 --> 08:37.769
From Ms. Four blankets
plus a bonus blanket?

08:37.837 --> 08:39.481
This morning, there she was,

08:39.662 --> 08:41.880
traipsing through the snow
in nothing but a nightgown.

08:44.644 --> 08:46.610
Look, I'd maim a duck
for a spoon right now.

08:46.612 --> 08:47.814
Yeah. Good luck.

08:47.868 --> 08:49.415
All of the cutlery has gone missing,

08:49.455 --> 08:51.939
including the fork with only one tine.

08:54.837 --> 08:56.384
You?!

08:56.781 --> 08:58.784
Waverly.

09:07.434 --> 09:09.442
My God!

09:15.278 --> 09:17.262
Dolls?

09:17.371 --> 09:18.542
Dolls, are you here?

09:28.435 --> 09:31.153
OK, we've really got to come up
with a secret handshake.

09:32.231 --> 09:34.296
Cause this greeting sucks.

09:39.163 --> 09:40.334
Dolls.

09:53.110 --> 09:55.219
Look at me. Look.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.155
Dolls, it's me.

09:59.630 --> 10:01.091
Dolls...

10:01.833 --> 10:03.987
Wynonna.

10:04.076 --> 10:05.834
No!

10:05.991 --> 10:07.929
No.

10:11.943 --> 10:13.763
No! Wynonna!

10:13.825 --> 10:15.426
I don't want you seeing me like this.

10:16.153 --> 10:18.912
Why? It's not like you...
you have a tail or something.

10:18.937 --> 10:22.034
I can't control it.

10:22.753 --> 10:25.603
I'm not leaving you.
Can you... can you get to the truck?

10:25.681 --> 10:27.477
It's just outside the door.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.823
You owe me so many massages.

11:00.573 --> 11:02.586
The lockpicking worked!

11:02.666 --> 11:04.173
Thank you, YouTube!

11:04.216 --> 11:05.806
Should... should we have a safe word?

11:05.873 --> 11:08.548
Like if I say "tacos are tasty"
send in the backup?

11:08.573 --> 11:09.620
<i>Sure.</i>

11:09.689 --> 11:11.710
Whatever. Hey, remember, you're there

11:11.757 --> 11:14.492
to drop off your bartender
application, but you got lost.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.923
<i>Anyone finds you, just smile
and play dumb, got it?</i>

11:18.017 --> 11:19.229
Wait, got what?

11:19.282 --> 11:20.493
<i>- I said...
- Sure.</i>

11:20.540 --> 11:21.884
Got it.

11:22.026 --> 11:25.112
<i>The briefcase is silver, heavy.
It's here. I know it is.</i>

11:25.159 --> 11:27.047
Check every office, every closet.

11:27.229 --> 11:29.237
Hey! Cupcake!

11:29.341 --> 11:31.461
- More like crap cakes.
- Crap what?

11:31.555 --> 11:32.976
Hi!

11:33.336 --> 11:35.712
- I'm...
- Late. VIPs are here.

11:35.789 --> 11:38.383
- Awesome!
- OK. Two Mobmobiles pulled up.

11:38.438 --> 11:40.878
<i>This could be our guy.
What's going on in there?</i>

11:42.018 --> 11:43.268
Hello, Earp?

11:43.323 --> 11:45.321
What's the matter?
You are entertainment...

11:45.448 --> 11:47.813
- Who the hell else would I be?
- Good.

11:47.906 --> 11:51.040
- Be onstage in five minutes.
- What?

11:53.785 --> 11:56.118
<i>- What should I do?
- Sing.</i>

11:59.436 --> 12:00.989
Doc?

12:01.050 --> 12:02.386
- The heck is he doing with you?
- A little help?

12:02.410 --> 12:03.374
This is not the plan.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.598
It's too dangerous.

12:04.622 --> 12:06.879
He needs his drugs. Now.

12:09.805 --> 12:11.377
The medicine isn't ready.

12:11.432 --> 12:13.611
Stay with me, Deputy Marshall.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.262
You never said he was law.

12:15.576 --> 12:17.921
- Is that going to be a problem?
- No. No, it's just...

12:17.923 --> 12:19.589
- She needs more time.
- I need to adjust

12:19.591 --> 12:21.624
the balance of acids
to alkaline for whatever he is.

12:21.647 --> 12:23.336
And I could use someone on the inside.

12:23.361 --> 12:25.734
OK, well, let me just call
Black Badge and tell them

12:25.759 --> 12:27.414
we have their number one
fugitive and that we'd like

12:27.438 --> 12:30.296
to borrow their recipe
for demon dope, OK?

12:30.486 --> 12:32.234
Unless Jeremy?

12:32.429 --> 12:34.827
We can't trust him. He's so...

12:34.867 --> 12:36.902
Willing to help?

12:37.960 --> 12:41.626
I'll be here. I'll be here.

12:41.704 --> 12:45.056
Even if you turn into a lizard
or a salamander

12:45.142 --> 12:48.318
or whatever you are.
We'll buy you a terrarium.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.054
Little sun lamp, couple of plants...

12:51.108 --> 12:52.922
Shh. Waverly!

12:53.132 --> 12:55.897
Hey. Hey. OK.

12:56.179 --> 12:58.019
- You're gonna come through this.
- Last night,

12:58.718 --> 13:01.813
in the barn... her eyes...

13:01.891 --> 13:04.813
She got a look in her eyes, Wynonna.

13:22.406 --> 13:23.992
Moment on the lips...

13:24.867 --> 13:26.593
I see you're still a bitch.

13:27.078 --> 13:28.476
You have to try this.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.679
Bacon. They should
put this on everything.

13:30.734 --> 13:32.867
They do. What are you, new?

13:33.640 --> 13:35.236
Where's Beth?

13:35.944 --> 13:38.670
She's just putting on her face.

13:40.147 --> 13:42.373
I was up half the night, by the way.

13:42.459 --> 13:43.545
That's funny. Why?

13:43.639 --> 13:45.947
Why you didn't stick up for me
with that ginger cop?

13:46.139 --> 13:48.446
- Don't you remember?
- Of course I remember.

13:48.555 --> 13:49.917
Why wouldn't I remember?

13:49.919 --> 13:51.919
I remember, and I don't like your tone.

13:52.336 --> 13:53.921
I just wanted to teach her a lesson.

13:53.961 --> 13:55.789
Well, maybe you should.

13:56.383 --> 13:58.793
Have you been mainlining
Beth's happy pills?

13:59.500 --> 14:01.789
- I don't know. Should I?
- Stop it.

14:02.488 --> 14:05.654
All you do is play games.
I don't like your games.

14:05.732 --> 14:07.982
Well then go play with someone else.

14:28.590 --> 14:31.592
This emblem here is an osprey,
symbolizing solar worship.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.195
Which doesn't make sense.

14:34.264 --> 14:37.162
You know, maybe it's an eagle.
Or Hawkman?

14:37.248 --> 14:39.400
- Jeremy, where's Waverly?
- With Lucado.

14:39.428 --> 14:41.366
- What's that smell?
- I know with Lucado,

14:41.397 --> 14:42.843
but where did Lucado go?

14:42.868 --> 14:44.936
Why? Did our illustrious boss
sit in it again?

14:45.151 --> 14:46.901
Again? What "again"?

14:47.050 --> 14:50.221
Lucado's so obsessed about
getting in good with BBD

14:50.284 --> 14:53.481
that she's, screwing up.
Messy reports,

14:53.600 --> 14:55.383
inappropriate phone calls to...

14:55.385 --> 14:58.475
- Ammonia! Mixed with clementines.
- Speaking of inappropriate...

14:58.555 --> 14:59.854
- Take off your coat.
- What?!

14:59.856 --> 15:02.765
- Coat!
- Get off me, Agent Chetri!

15:06.738 --> 15:08.896
You can start fires with your mind?

15:08.898 --> 15:13.910
No! Polyester and CH3M5 do not mix!

15:14.019 --> 15:16.003
How did you even
come in contact with it?

15:16.005 --> 15:17.598
I've only ever seen it used on...

15:19.663 --> 15:21.022
No...

15:21.110 --> 15:23.960
You tell anyone
and I'll rip your balls off.

15:24.022 --> 15:26.013
Dolls is alive! I knew it!

15:26.077 --> 15:28.872
- What do you care?
- It would really stick it to BBD.

15:28.958 --> 15:30.536
And?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.420
He's the only Marshall who understood

15:32.422 --> 15:34.902
what happened to my Mom plus one
time he helped me do a chinup.

15:34.973 --> 15:37.225
OK, that doesn't like him,

15:37.847 --> 15:39.909
but we're the ones who are
screwed, because we're

15:39.948 --> 15:42.730
this close to engineering
his antidemon juice.

15:48.343 --> 15:50.137
Yeah, you're just using too much ammonia.

15:50.593 --> 15:52.106
Classic Wynonna.

15:52.398 --> 15:55.726
- We could use your help.
- Bading bading.

15:56.986 --> 16:00.658
- You shortcircuiting, Bb8?
- No. That's where Waverly is.

16:00.697 --> 16:02.525
Thank you. All right.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.996
You go to Shorty's, save Dolls.
I'll get the girl.

16:05.286 --> 16:06.934
Yes. Awesome.

16:07.023 --> 16:09.559
Now I feel like Hawkman.

16:21.062 --> 16:23.640
Sorry, can we start that again? Thank you.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.144
Thank you.

18:20.257 --> 18:23.052
I had hoped you'd
be good at this, but wow!

18:23.077 --> 18:25.523
Listen, this guy may not have stolen
the briefcase for himself.

18:25.547 --> 18:27.028
I think he's going to sell it.

18:27.030 --> 18:29.875
- A buyer? Who?
- I don't know.

18:30.199 --> 18:32.199
<i>You mean, you don't know yet.</i>

18:37.119 --> 18:40.111
The Black Badge Agent
put up quite a fight.

18:40.176 --> 18:41.889
Makes me think stealing this briefcase

18:41.935 --> 18:43.647
is worth more than you're paying.

18:43.709 --> 18:45.967
- Then we'll double your fee.
- Triple.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.275
My colleagues and I reached
out to you in good faith.

18:48.363 --> 18:51.241
- What's in the briefcase?
- That's none of your business.

18:51.420 --> 18:54.808
See, it really is.
I've been hearing things.

18:55.371 --> 18:57.625
Nasty stuff this way comes.

18:57.699 --> 19:00.261
I need to pad the coffers.
I need to arm up.

19:01.812 --> 19:03.164
Is it a weapon?

19:04.117 --> 19:06.320
I can pay you four times your fee.

19:08.101 --> 19:10.079
It's a big weapon.

19:13.658 --> 19:16.971
Tacos are tasty! Tacos! Tacos are tasty!

19:17.013 --> 19:19.885
Waverly? Waverly!

19:20.573 --> 19:23.205
- Where is she?
- The mission was just recon!

19:23.268 --> 19:25.255
- Everything was fine.
- Was?

19:25.357 --> 19:27.263
There was a gunshot.

19:27.643 --> 19:29.560
I'm going in. Call backup or tactical

19:29.607 --> 19:31.340
or whoever's hiding in the bushes.

19:33.483 --> 19:35.296
There's no one in the bushes.

19:35.749 --> 19:37.733
I have been blackballed by HQ.

19:37.796 --> 19:39.743
They ignore my reports and my messages.

19:40.186 --> 19:41.751
This is my one shot to get back in...

19:42.798 --> 19:44.638
My sister's in there, you bitch.

19:45.263 --> 19:48.935
Anything happens to her, I'll give you
one shot. Right between the eyes.

19:52.927 --> 19:54.434
Waves!

19:54.474 --> 19:56.517
Thank God. Are you hurt?

19:56.607 --> 19:59.271
- Tacos are tasty.
- Did you do that?

20:00.715 --> 20:02.515
No.

20:02.655 --> 20:03.958
Let's go. Come on.

20:04.272 --> 20:06.394
Hello! I'm rescuing you. Let's go.

20:06.462 --> 20:08.253
I can't.

20:08.364 --> 20:10.151
And neither can you.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.939
Super.

20:24.470 --> 20:26.089
We have to talk.

20:26.206 --> 20:27.878
Next time, book a spa day.

20:28.057 --> 20:29.596
You blew my cover.

20:29.636 --> 20:31.893
There were gunshots.
Like I was gonna hang in the van.

20:31.949 --> 20:33.348
Lucado called you in?!

20:33.390 --> 20:35.343
Doesn't anybody have any faith in me?

20:35.421 --> 20:37.937
- You, BBD...
- Waves!

20:38.074 --> 20:39.808
Don't worry, ladies.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.730
The pussy's well out of the bag.

20:41.863 --> 20:44.616
Although, you may be the best looking.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.550
Black Badge agents I've ever seen.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.092
Might be? Please.

20:49.279 --> 20:51.173
Untie me and I'll rock your world.

20:51.301 --> 20:53.207
You've got about 90 seconds

20:53.254 --> 20:55.418
before a BBD recovery team comes in

20:55.473 --> 20:57.241
and goes all John Wick on your ass.

20:57.266 --> 20:59.475
If you mean the ice queen in the van,

20:59.682 --> 21:02.698
she's alreadyflown south.
But enough blather.

21:02.909 --> 21:04.963
What's in the case?

21:06.122 --> 21:08.192
Seriously, Waverly. Poker face.

21:11.372 --> 21:12.864
Sing, little birdy.

21:15.570 --> 21:19.055
If you don't even know what's
in it, why steal it?

21:20.032 --> 21:22.612
I'm a bit like Robin Hood.

21:22.696 --> 21:26.116
I steal from the rich, and
I sell to the highest bidder.

21:26.644 --> 21:28.949
Dude, you gotta watch that movie again.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.594
I did say "a bit."

21:31.258 --> 21:32.579
Now...

21:33.274 --> 21:34.791
Black Badge wants it.

21:34.852 --> 21:37.579
My client was willing to pay
through the nose for it.

21:37.641 --> 21:39.258
But why?

21:40.718 --> 21:43.929
What does EE stand for?

21:44.430 --> 21:46.080
Don't.

21:47.187 --> 21:48.786
Alright then.

21:51.692 --> 21:53.200
Close the club,

21:53.692 --> 21:55.302
and bring me my tools.

21:55.513 --> 21:58.027
We're going to have a nice long chat.

22:01.699 --> 22:03.988
Chats aren't good.

22:05.856 --> 22:07.607
Alright, that looks
about the right color. Come on.

22:07.631 --> 22:09.435
I'm not sure about the dosage though.

22:09.498 --> 22:10.897
Well, he's worse
than we've ever seen him,

22:10.921 --> 22:12.273
so we're gonna have to risk it.

22:12.460 --> 22:13.624
Then hold him down.

22:13.695 --> 22:16.510
No! No! No! No! No!
Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't!

22:16.570 --> 22:18.669
Talk, or the last sound you'll ever hear

22:18.716 --> 22:20.216
is the crushing of your larynx.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.205
You give him that much

22:21.206 --> 22:23.072
after he's been off this long
and his veins will burst,

22:23.096 --> 22:26.187
his heart will stop and he'll
definitely, probably die.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.101
Why should we believe you?

22:29.601 --> 22:32.570
Firepower. Buxom biochemist. Hello.

22:32.662 --> 22:34.935
BBD Science.

22:36.708 --> 22:39.279
Wynonna's decided to trust me.

22:39.482 --> 22:41.091
And we all know that's a big deal.

22:42.099 --> 22:43.927
If our friend here is going to live,

22:44.146 --> 22:45.962
he's going to need all of us.

22:54.050 --> 22:56.652
So, this isn't the best birthday.

22:56.777 --> 22:58.035
Shit.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.871
No, I'm kidding. It's not my birthday.

23:01.161 --> 23:02.325
Wait...

23:02.450 --> 23:04.098
You know when my birthday is, right?

23:04.348 --> 23:07.044
Don't yell at me.
I'm already getting wicked rope burn.

23:08.359 --> 23:10.162
I shouldn't have trusted Lucado.

23:11.537 --> 23:13.890
- There's no backup.
- Well, listen.

23:14.013 --> 23:15.892
We've been in worse spots.
This is just another

23:15.894 --> 23:17.678
bad fake birthday.

23:19.788 --> 23:21.470
This is all my fault.

23:23.006 --> 23:25.541
I just wanted
to go all Wynonna for once.

23:27.384 --> 23:30.124
Stick to being Waverly.
She's pretty great.

23:31.429 --> 23:33.577
There's something wrong with her...

23:35.601 --> 23:38.085
- Me.
- No. Come on.

23:38.179 --> 23:39.904
We just lost a sister.

23:40.310 --> 23:43.412
- Our home's infested with demons.
- No.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.529
You think so too.

23:46.279 --> 23:49.568
I know it was just for like,
a second, but...

23:50.999 --> 23:52.844
you thought I killed that guy.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.000
The sleepwalking,

23:56.112 --> 23:58.524
the gaps in my memories...

23:59.067 --> 24:01.434
it... it all started at that arch.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.663
Where Willa crossed the boundary.

24:04.030 --> 24:06.554
- The tentacle thing...
- Yeah. I sliced it. Hard.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.846
No, there was something left, OK?

24:09.381 --> 24:10.694
This...

24:11.316 --> 24:14.233
perfect pool of shiny goo.

24:15.201 --> 24:16.858
It... it was calling to me.

24:17.514 --> 24:19.905
It's like I can almost remember

24:19.993 --> 24:22.125
and then my head gets hot
and I'm like...

24:22.127 --> 24:23.977
OK. Stop. Listen.

24:24.231 --> 24:26.064
I'm going
to Cirque du Soleil this phone

24:26.098 --> 24:27.864
into position, call Doc for back up,

24:27.899 --> 24:30.299
and then ol' Robin Hood's gonna
oodalally right to Hell,

24:30.325 --> 24:33.142
and then we'll figure out
what's up with you.

24:33.299 --> 24:34.439
Together.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.729
Right. So, you're going to call Doc.

24:41.549 --> 24:42.992
OK.

24:47.713 --> 24:49.674
Siri, call Doc Holliday!

24:49.748 --> 24:51.148
<i>Calling Holiday Inn.</i>

24:51.241 --> 24:53.913
- No! Damn it!
- Stupid bitch.

24:56.296 --> 24:58.348
I want you to tie it tighter,
alright, just don't

24:58.390 --> 25:01.226
- cut off my circulation.
- Not that I ain't glad

25:01.288 --> 25:03.312
to see you, but you cocked up the plan.

25:03.452 --> 25:05.366
How do you know you weren't followed?

25:05.440 --> 25:08.346
'Cause the only guys that followed
me got their asses handed to 'em.

25:08.604 --> 25:11.831
- Exmilitary.
- Courtesy of one vengeful Lucado.

25:11.964 --> 25:14.171
Yeah. You know, I think

25:14.173 --> 25:16.685
you're kind of afraid
that the ladies will cool down.

25:16.763 --> 25:19.013
Now that the competition's back.

25:19.662 --> 25:23.670
Well, I think one lady in particular
doesn't know what she wants,

25:23.928 --> 25:26.928
though I suspect
she will prefer it to be human.

25:27.131 --> 25:29.486
Well, you look really small
without your hat.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.916
How'd you make it back here?

25:35.791 --> 25:39.057
Some guy found me
holed up in a hunter's cabin.

25:39.164 --> 25:40.814
Drove me back to the Earp Homestead

25:40.864 --> 25:43.494
and said that my job wasn't done.

25:43.636 --> 25:44.892
This fella,

25:44.962 --> 25:47.377
he happen to go
by the name of Juan Carlo?

25:47.628 --> 25:49.284
Yeah.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.995
Yeah, he gets around.

25:52.448 --> 25:55.792
Likes to speak in riddles,
more sass than sense.

25:56.507 --> 25:58.421
Yeah, he had a nice truck though.

26:07.492 --> 26:09.559
He also said that
something's been broken?

26:10.225 --> 26:12.102
Does that mean anything to you?

26:13.953 --> 26:16.094
Your phone's blowing up.

26:27.706 --> 26:29.963
And I thought that pizza sucked.

26:30.085 --> 26:32.704
Tucker Gardner, how can I help you?

26:33.635 --> 26:36.048
My sisters. Acting weird.

26:37.345 --> 26:38.562
Well...

26:38.672 --> 26:40.406
I mean, I'd take the weird

26:40.456 --> 26:43.156
because they saved you
from being charged.

26:45.668 --> 26:46.930
I'm sorry.

26:48.136 --> 26:51.138
Did you apologize to the girls
you were photographing?

26:51.238 --> 26:52.737
You're Waverly's...

26:53.893 --> 26:56.707
- friend.
- That's not super relevant.

26:56.802 --> 26:58.608
She's been acting weird too, hasn't she?

26:59.333 --> 27:01.489
One minute, dear sweet Waverly.

27:02.247 --> 27:03.914
The next?

27:04.591 --> 27:06.283
She nearly choked me to death.

27:06.661 --> 27:08.653
Nice try.

27:09.088 --> 27:11.067
I figure that's why you're so angry.

27:11.786 --> 27:14.129
Because she's been
acting strange around you too.

27:15.839 --> 27:17.318
I think you should get out of here.

27:17.347 --> 27:18.942
I don't want to cause trouble!

27:19.019 --> 27:22.232
But if our Waverly is dangerous
then it's a town issue, don't you think?

27:23.784 --> 27:26.706
I could... always talk to her for you.

27:26.808 --> 27:28.772
- I said get out.
- I'm trying to help.

27:28.917 --> 27:30.816
I'm not a bad person.

27:31.058 --> 27:34.311
And if you know what's good for you,
you'll stop treating me like one.

27:57.683 --> 28:00.904
Boo, I was two weeks
from getting a free upgrade.

28:01.004 --> 28:04.746
Cujo... check for guns and phones.

28:06.271 --> 28:08.527
Post guards. You know where.

28:09.863 --> 28:11.246
If we have guests coming,

28:11.363 --> 28:13.832
we wanna be sure to give them
a warm welcome.

28:14.071 --> 28:17.586
You know, I have never encountered

28:17.985 --> 28:20.438
this particular type of metal before.

28:20.692 --> 28:23.026
What? You mean your tools didn't work?

28:23.133 --> 28:25.796
Well, good thing
I have the Earp sisters. Up!

28:25.863 --> 28:28.183
Don't! Don't! Don't touch her!

28:28.464 --> 28:31.925
Hey! I'm only Black Badge
under duress, OK?

28:31.970 --> 28:34.438
Clearance Level 0 doesn't even
get you a free sub card.

28:34.531 --> 28:37.941
Well, let's start with the initials. EE.

28:38.523 --> 28:42.422
EazyE. Eeyore. Eee EArthur.

28:44.349 --> 28:46.016
Let her go!

28:47.382 --> 28:49.390
- No!
- Listen asscapade,

28:49.452 --> 28:51.460
I know nothing
about this goddamn briefcase!

29:08.372 --> 29:11.268
- Edwin Earp! Edwin Earp!
- Of course it's an Earp.

29:11.666 --> 29:14.924
So you know the combination. Unlock it.

29:14.977 --> 29:17.767
Edwin Earp, the oneyear wonder...

29:17.850 --> 29:21.051
- when did Grandpa become the heir?
- 1967!

29:21.244 --> 29:23.150
Combination's five digits!

29:23.977 --> 29:26.156
- I don't know!
- I think you're stalling.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.860
No! No! No!

29:29.743 --> 29:32.196
Let her go, and I will
get you the combination.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.571
I will literally hunt down my superior

29:34.625 --> 29:37.460
and drag her Pilatessculpted
ass back here myself!

29:37.484 --> 29:39.218
Wynonna.

29:43.642 --> 29:46.157
That was dumb.

29:46.231 --> 29:48.764
Waverly!

29:52.416 --> 29:54.417
No!

29:58.835 --> 30:02.093
Waverly! Waverly!

30:02.671 --> 30:04.097
Now...

30:04.574 --> 30:07.800
you can unlock it, or she can bleed out.

30:07.877 --> 30:10.976
We are going to kill the shit
out of your stupid face!

30:11.062 --> 30:12.219
We who?

30:12.305 --> 30:14.875
There's no backup, remember?

30:33.980 --> 30:37.014
Woo! This must be the place.

30:47.147 --> 30:48.561
Waverly.

30:48.585 --> 30:51.465
- This isn't happening.
- This isn't happening. OK?

30:51.520 --> 30:53.216
Waves, your hand.

30:53.256 --> 30:56.012
OK. We gotta get out of here.

30:56.059 --> 30:58.654
Yeah. Yeah, we gotta get out of here!

30:59.286 --> 31:01.623
God! OK.

31:03.999 --> 31:05.718
I'm sorry! Come on!

31:05.773 --> 31:08.812
Come on! I know! I know! I know!

31:09.743 --> 31:11.448
Keep that thing wrapped tight.

31:11.587 --> 31:14.088
- That's what she said.
- God I love you.

31:17.177 --> 31:18.482
Sorry about your friends.

31:18.507 --> 31:19.942
Stay!

31:22.060 --> 31:24.984
Damn. I liked her.

31:25.096 --> 31:26.741
You're gonna pay for that.

31:26.882 --> 31:29.734
But you're not leaving
'til you open this thing.

31:29.965 --> 31:31.617
Look, Ginsu,

31:32.000 --> 31:33.421
that's Earp property.

31:33.445 --> 31:35.773
Thanks for getting it back
from Black Badge and everything,

31:36.257 --> 31:37.882
but we got it from here.

31:37.973 --> 31:40.440
Ooh! Savage!

31:40.829 --> 31:42.608
- Come on!
- Wait! What about the briefcase?

31:42.677 --> 31:44.242
Eff it!

31:45.695 --> 31:47.585
One milliliter an hour

31:47.655 --> 31:50.734
for the next 12 hours.
Slow but steady, OK?

31:50.808 --> 31:53.023
You are a genius with this stuff!

31:53.167 --> 31:55.105
Why am I just meeting you now?

31:55.277 --> 31:59.292
Geniuses are often unappreciated
until they're dead.

31:59.423 --> 32:01.160
Which I am not.

32:01.250 --> 32:04.783
Which you can see, 'cause dead
would be the worst.

32:04.854 --> 32:05.963
Torture, maybe, actually...

32:05.995 --> 32:08.276
I sure could have used your
help reformulating this serum.

32:08.326 --> 32:09.823
They never showed us the formula.

32:09.901 --> 32:12.526
We just studied the dosage, and
its effects on the specimens.

32:12.581 --> 32:15.261
- Specimens?
- Stupid idiot.

32:15.346 --> 32:19.011
Not... Not you. Me. I shouldn't
be talking to a civilian like this.

32:19.167 --> 32:21.784
No wonder BBD doesn't trust me.

32:22.285 --> 32:26.353
- I trust you.
- Wow. OK. No. Um...

32:26.916 --> 32:29.090
Not in front of Dolls.

32:29.192 --> 32:31.521
I just don't want him
to get the wrong impression.

32:31.871 --> 32:34.485
You are gorgeous

32:34.719 --> 32:36.352
for a girl,

32:37.633 --> 32:39.362
but you are a girl.

32:41.677 --> 32:43.597
Honey, I was just trying to coerce you

32:43.668 --> 32:45.588
into getting lattes
from a place down the street.

32:46.074 --> 32:47.441
I'm...

32:47.539 --> 32:49.926
I'm getting razzed
'cause I'm part of the team?

32:49.974 --> 32:51.691
Alright, cool.

32:54.245 --> 32:55.614
- OK.
- Yeah.

32:55.670 --> 32:58.199
Alright, got the lattes!

33:01.058 --> 33:02.941
OK, watch your step.

33:06.077 --> 33:08.707
Sorry. Sorry!
That's my fault. I'm sorry.

33:15.667 --> 33:17.400
I hope that really hurt.

33:21.279 --> 33:23.834
- I'm just all ran out of bullets.
- He took her hand.

33:23.998 --> 33:25.309
Waverly!

33:35.689 --> 33:37.251
You want this?

33:38.555 --> 33:40.328
Doc says I have to wait.

33:40.930 --> 33:42.227
Who are you?

33:42.383 --> 33:45.617
This wasn't easy to replicate.
It might cure you,

33:46.275 --> 33:47.689
it might kill you.

33:47.782 --> 33:50.662
Though it sounds like this isn't the
first time you've been a guinea pig.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.880
Shit! Don't!

33:56.990 --> 33:59.146
Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't!
Don't! Don't! Don't Don't!

34:09.072 --> 34:11.110
Run. Run!

34:22.355 --> 34:24.833
Hold on, little darlin'.
This'll staunch the flow

34:24.835 --> 34:26.996
until we get you to a hospital.

34:27.138 --> 34:29.635
I'll go find... her hand.

34:29.761 --> 34:31.659
What for? You gonna bury the thing?

34:31.706 --> 34:34.746
It's called modern medicine, Doc!
They can reattach anything,

34:34.771 --> 34:37.565
- we just gotta work fast!
- Wynonna, where are you going?

34:37.591 --> 34:39.231
It's OK, sweetie.
You'll play piano again.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.639
Wynonna? Wynonna!

34:42.703 --> 34:43.773
What, Doc?!

34:43.859 --> 34:46.132
My God, wait, who got hurt?

34:46.812 --> 34:48.226
You.

34:52.702 --> 34:54.703
How the hell is that possible?
He chopped it off!

34:54.795 --> 34:57.318
- Did he?
- Yeah! I saw the blood.

34:57.373 --> 34:59.495
I heard you scream. You saw it.

34:59.571 --> 35:01.602
Well, I... I kind of turned away.

35:01.837 --> 35:05.227
The power of suggestion
is a formidable thing.

35:05.295 --> 35:06.734
Doc, I know what I saw.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.758
And yet Waverly still seems to be intact.

35:08.914 --> 35:10.534
Do you have another explanation?

35:12.953 --> 35:15.177
Well then, if everyone has
all their limbs,

35:15.244 --> 35:16.916
we have more work to attend to.

35:16.981 --> 35:21.118
- We'll drop you off at home.
- Now, is this ours?

35:28.001 --> 35:29.032
Hey.

35:29.134 --> 35:31.197
I didn't realize
you'd be bringing company.

35:31.438 --> 35:33.014
Somebody having a bad trip?

35:33.632 --> 35:35.952
- I told you to wait.
- He didn't give me much of a choice.

35:35.999 --> 35:38.741
- Well, how much did he take?
- All of it.

35:40.412 --> 35:42.538
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to help him.

35:42.647 --> 35:44.451
<i>EstÃºpida. He's not himself.</i>

35:44.514 --> 35:46.742
<i>Hey, estÃºpida!
How the hell would you know?</i>

35:46.744 --> 35:49.078
I've talked him down before,
I can do it again.

35:49.534 --> 35:52.003
It might be our only shot,
before he hurts himself.

35:54.551 --> 35:56.419
They ran out of pumpkin spice.

35:56.444 --> 35:58.433
Friar Cuck.

35:58.512 --> 36:00.558
My guys have the place surrounded.

36:00.870 --> 36:02.238
The briefcase,

36:02.536 --> 36:04.336
or he dies first.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.762
He's the new guy.
Last one in, first one out.

36:06.764 --> 36:08.730
- What?!
- Jeremy, loosen up.

36:08.808 --> 36:10.833
I'm about to poop my pants.

36:11.074 --> 36:13.202
- Not that loose.
- The briefcase!

36:13.308 --> 36:14.972
It belongs to the Earps.

36:15.042 --> 36:17.925
Well, I guess we're about to have
a whole lot of killing.

36:18.098 --> 36:20.196
Put it on the table.

36:20.294 --> 36:22.031
- Peacemaker too.
- OK.

36:22.450 --> 36:24.653
OK?!

36:28.323 --> 36:30.136
It's yours.

36:30.878 --> 36:32.557
Take it.

36:34.894 --> 36:37.960
Anyone tries anything,
the whole place goes up in flames.

37:01.226 --> 37:02.300
What...

37:02.410 --> 37:04.245
- Was...
- That?!

37:04.337 --> 37:07.667
Way cool, with a side of habanero.

37:13.679 --> 37:15.160
Dolls?

37:17.168 --> 37:18.587
Firebreather?

37:18.871 --> 37:20.223
Dragon Face? Just...

37:20.325 --> 37:23.301
just give me some indication
as to who I'm talking to.

37:30.781 --> 37:32.516
Wow!

37:34.061 --> 37:37.436
- Did you see that?!
- I thought tying a cherry stem

37:37.506 --> 37:39.889
into a knot with my tongue
was a cool party trick.

37:39.977 --> 37:42.645
Could I get some water?
Please? It's hot.

37:42.702 --> 37:44.148
Doc, water.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.624
Hey!

37:49.506 --> 37:51.416
How's work?

38:02.743 --> 38:03.899
Thanks, man.

38:09.025 --> 38:10.848
Something is coming.

38:10.942 --> 38:13.375
Winter? Yeah, we got the memo.

38:14.847 --> 38:16.918
You're not ready.

38:20.461 --> 38:22.708
You'll never be ready.

38:22.879 --> 38:24.461
I'm ready now.

38:40.155 --> 38:41.703
You're here!

38:43.337 --> 38:45.805
Just for my things, then I'm gone.

38:46.207 --> 38:48.184
We've been waiting for you. All of us.

38:48.246 --> 38:49.809
Who's all of us?

38:50.004 --> 38:51.848
We have something we want you to see.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.297
If you think you're going to
lock me in there...

38:54.500 --> 38:55.711
Why would we do that?

38:56.024 --> 38:58.156
You're too angry and too dark
to be locked up.

38:58.507 --> 39:00.836
You need space to let your darkness grow.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.516
We intend to nurture your prowess.

39:03.790 --> 39:05.158
My prowess?

39:15.262 --> 39:16.957
Beth!

39:19.019 --> 39:20.343
Who are you?

39:20.387 --> 39:22.120
What did you do to my sisters?

39:22.330 --> 39:23.713
We're your sisters now.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.433
You're the reason we chose them.

39:25.573 --> 39:27.503
You'll never be locked up again.

39:27.892 --> 39:29.884
A new world is coming.

39:29.956 --> 39:31.676
We need your help.
In return, we'll give you

39:31.750 --> 39:33.617
- anything you want.
- Anything?

39:33.713 --> 39:35.393
Anything.

39:40.234 --> 39:41.781
I want a girl.

39:48.104 --> 39:49.971
Edwin Earp, the One Year Wonder.

39:50.057 --> 39:53.320
Grandpappy put down 70 revenants
in 300 days.

39:53.437 --> 39:55.109
With the help of BBD of course.

39:55.203 --> 39:57.086
Yeah, well...
Whatever's in his briefcase

39:57.134 --> 39:59.601
has Lucado creaming her granny panties.

39:59.682 --> 40:02.853
Only thing between us and it
are five numbers.

40:03.010 --> 40:04.841
June 18, 1940.

40:05.877 --> 40:07.416
Edwin's birthday.

40:08.127 --> 40:09.688
I googled it.

40:10.187 --> 40:11.719
OK.

40:15.844 --> 40:17.787
Here we go.

40:23.263 --> 40:25.169
- Yeah.
- It's... a plate.

40:25.275 --> 40:27.108
Are we going to give it to Lucado?

40:27.152 --> 40:28.676
Hell no! You lost...

40:29.124 --> 40:30.855
nearly lost a hand over it.

40:33.676 --> 40:36.592
We should talk about the...

40:37.170 --> 40:39.387
demon goo...

40:39.475 --> 40:41.662
At the arch.

40:42.139 --> 40:43.560
Babe...

40:44.404 --> 40:46.607
whatever you did, I want to help.

40:46.822 --> 40:48.185
Good...

40:48.310 --> 40:51.084
because I am so sick of fighting her.

40:51.232 --> 40:52.928
She's so strong.

40:53.623 --> 40:56.131
- The thing inside of you?
- No, stupid.

40:57.123 --> 40:59.030
The thing outside of me.

41:00.342 --> 41:01.748
Waverly.

41:09.252 --> 41:11.516
Like you're gonna kill another sister.

41:11.610 --> 41:13.368
I won't let you kill her either.

41:13.623 --> 41:15.071
If only.

41:15.625 --> 41:17.266
She's been resisting me so hard.

41:18.305 --> 41:19.428
I'm exhausted.

41:19.798 --> 41:21.340
Do you know how much energy it takes

41:21.368 --> 41:23.004
to regrow a human hand?

41:23.375 --> 41:26.991
Waverly, baby girl,
if you're still in there...

41:27.037 --> 41:28.866
I'm not having any fun.

41:31.295 --> 41:33.198
But today...

41:35.125 --> 41:36.869
You. You...

41:38.034 --> 41:40.244
you like to have fun.

41:40.390 --> 41:42.376
Yeah, I'm a real hoot.

41:45.594 --> 41:49.090
And you'd be so easy.

41:50.437 --> 41:51.934
What?

42:16.023 --> 42:19.296
Yeah. This is so much better.

42:22.116 --> 42:23.421
Now...

42:25.648 --> 42:29.125
what are we going to do with you?
