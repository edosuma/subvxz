01:13.680 --> 01:15.799
l truly don't even know
why I'm here doctor.

01:16.360 --> 01:19.759
Well of course it's difficult
running a large household by one self...

01:19.920 --> 01:23.759
and raising four children is exhausting.
But they're wonderful, wonderful children.

01:23.920 --> 01:24.999
And my husband...

01:25.520 --> 01:27.679
he's a good man. A very hard worker.

01:28.518 --> 01:29.782
And huuu...

01:30.769 --> 01:31.265
[clears throat]

01:31.266 --> 01:33.441
There were...there is just...one thing...

01:36.640 --> 01:38.039
Sometimes at night...

01:39.680 --> 01:40.959
and it comes to me.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.959
l imagine myself...

01:44.360 --> 01:46.959
splitting his fat, bold head

01:47.120 --> 01:48.919
with a great large axe.

01:52.080 --> 01:56.279
lt's just a feeling that comes over me
many...many times a day...

01:56.560 --> 01:57.839
a feeling of humm...

01:58.680 --> 02:00.399
expectation, aah...

02:01.600 --> 02:02.679
hungering.

02:03.060 --> 02:07.216
[Crying]

02:07.440 --> 02:10.359
How do you bear it, this English weather?

02:10.919 --> 02:13.999
l cannot sing from the sadness.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.799
I open my mouth...

02:16.493 --> 02:17.774
[Sing terribly]

02:18.200 --> 02:19.799
You see?
Nothing.

02:20.773 --> 02:21.808
[Sobbing]

02:22.510 --> 02:24.670
[Continues crying]

02:24.680 --> 02:27.877
Well and with my dear Allister's gone
it's two years now l...

02:30.281 --> 02:33.638
l should thought l'm far,
far too old for this kinds of feelings...

02:33.639 --> 02:35.519
but well, there they are...

03:58.080 --> 03:58.959
Nurse!

03:59.332 --> 04:01.730
l ask you to clean this wound
and put on fresh bandages.

04:01.958 --> 04:02.200
Umm...

04:02.600 --> 04:03.999
Dr. Richardson told me

04:04.160 --> 04:05.639
not to waste supplies.

04:05.800 --> 04:06.999
ls he mad? No...

04:07.160 --> 04:10.159
We must keep the wound
clean to prevent sepsis.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.439
- What 'sis'?
- Sepsis.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.479
lnfection. lt's caused by germs

04:14.640 --> 04:16.039
entering the wound.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.119
Germs. They're tiny creatures

04:20.279 --> 04:21.639
that invade the body.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.559
Causing pain, fever,

04:23.760 --> 04:24.679
infections.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.759
l don't think l have those.

04:26.920 --> 04:27.959
-You can't see them.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.439
They're invisible.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.855
Please, just fetch me a beaker of carbolic acid solution and fresh bandage.

04:37.000 --> 04:37.959
Yes, doctor.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.839
Honestly...

04:42.133 --> 04:45.957
ugh...That oaf Richardson had this way
with perform surgery in the sewer

04:45.958 --> 04:47.170
using rusty saws

04:47.171 --> 04:49.559
and it would be Beekman's pills for everybody.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.119
no matter the ailment...

04:51.380 --> 04:52.082
-Granville.

04:52.550 --> 04:56.863
l'm aware l specifically told the nurse
not to change these bandages.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.679
Soiled bandages are a heaven for germs.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.279
Germ's theory is poppycock, Granville.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.879
Now stop speaking of it.
You're frightening the patients.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.159
Poppycock? But Lister has proved it.
All the latest journals...

05:08.320 --> 05:09.559
-Tight, Granville.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.519
No, we won't be needing those.
Thanks very much.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.519
A study there of calm reassurance

05:15.680 --> 05:17.439
and regular bleeding.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.319
These are the keys to modern medicine.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.942
Will you remain calm, when the
leg putrefies  and become gangrenous?

05:24.760 --> 05:25.999
When you amputate...

05:26.160 --> 05:28.799
when the rots spread to her blood and kills her?

05:28.960 --> 05:30.479
l've had quite enough
of your impotence.

05:30.640 --> 05:35.049
Put back that bandage and bleed a pint.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.959
Look...look at her, man.
You...you get more blood out of a turnip.

05:38.120 --> 05:38.759
Do as you're told.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.559
And give her Beekman's pills for insurance.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.860
Beekman's pills are rubbish.

05:43.861 --> 05:45.538
They will do nothing but
bring on stomach cramps.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.839
l won't stand here and watch you murder your patients

05:48.000 --> 05:50.839
just because you can't be bothered
to read the latest science.

05:52.659 --> 05:54.304
Hahahahaha...

05:54.720 --> 05:55.799
At long last

05:55.960 --> 05:57.319
we agree, Granville.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.199
Bloody dinosaur.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.108
Oh...

06:04.810 --> 06:05.570
Huh...

06:34.840 --> 06:37.039
Good day Mrs. Copeland.
ls Edmund in?

06:37.200 --> 06:38.199
l wouldn't know, sir.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.599
Guess it all knows my part is
delivery stay at night.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.901
If I didn't love his parents so, I'd never stay.

06:43.902 --> 06:44.832
I'd pack my bags,

06:45.160 --> 06:47.214
and all this electrical equipment.

06:47.581 --> 06:48.581
lt's a fire hazard, that's what it is.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.039
I'll try his study.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.519
You. Why have you stopped?

06:53.327 --> 07:01.124
[lndistinct chatter]

07:07.317 --> 07:08.225
Ow!

07:10.160 --> 07:13.400
Now, that is not what you're supposed to do.

07:13.401 --> 07:14.110
[Door opens]

07:15.600 --> 07:16.359
Hello.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.732
[Humming]

07:18.800 --> 07:20.200
Ahhh...

07:20.320 --> 07:21.039
Oh no.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.759
You haven't been sacked again, have you?

07:23.160 --> 07:26.959
l've tell you, Edmund.
The healing arts in England are positively lethal.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.519
lt's no coincident that the morgues
are placed adjacent to the hospitals.

07:30.520 --> 07:31.130
-Ahh...

07:31.360 --> 07:32.327
Well, this is 1880's.

07:32.330 --> 07:35.340
We're meant to be in the midst of a medical revolution.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.919
ls it asking too much to use just
a bit of what science has provided.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.399
Rather than...go about indiscriminately killing people?

07:42.420 --> 07:44.519
Yeah, well it's little bit like that.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.759
What's all the fuss outside?

07:49.280 --> 07:50.679
My new generator.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.479
You purchase a generator
just last year.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.559
Obsolete. This is half the size
and leavess double the power.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.479
l never thought I'd say this. But...

08:03.880 --> 08:04.959
l've lost hope.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.959
Since l was a boy, all l wanted was
to practice medicine.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.199
And to help...

08:11.160 --> 08:13.079
people that actually needed it.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.479
But l'm beginning to fear
that the world is set against me.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.559
Well, what you gonna do?

08:21.600 --> 08:22.999
Private practice, l suppose.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.759
I shall harness myself
to some greedy pill pusher.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.759
Shut my mouth.
And pray that it nets me a steady income.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.479
Or, I could give you ten thousand pounds,
so you could whatever you wish.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.839
uhh...I've told you a thousand times, Edmund.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.179
You and your family done
quite enough for me already.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.318
Oh, come on, Mortimer.
l'd hardly miss it.

08:41.799 --> 08:42.999
That's not the point.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.239
I simply must make my own way in the world.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.359
You're so wonderfully middle class.

08:48.365 --> 08:49.199
Haha..

08:49.200 --> 08:50.079
Thank you.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.799
Oh, by the way.
There seems to be a young man

08:56.960 --> 08:58.439
sleeping on your stairs.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.399
Really?

09:02.200 --> 09:02.650
Huh...

10:01.643 --> 10:03.439
[Clear throat]
Good Morning.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.999
Mortimer Granville to see Dr. Dalrymple.
l have an appointment.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.159
He's with someone now.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.559
l see. Very well.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.079
l shall wait, then.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.199
Ladies.

10:17.637 --> 10:18.700
Ladies.

10:22.416 --> 10:23.611
Umm...

10:35.542 --> 10:36.240
Ahh...

10:38.973 --> 10:39.873
It's lovely.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.039
Japanese, I think.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.639
You're a charlatan...

11:12.640 --> 11:14.039
with no more idea

11:14.480 --> 11:16.804
of a woman's wants or needs than

11:16.525 --> 11:19.519
of...of the Moon's atmosphere.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.055
Charlotte, I simply want you to behave...

11:21.056 --> 11:25.323
You may be unaware, but there is a social revolution of foods.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.761
Women, will no longer be denied our rightful place.

11:28.440 --> 11:32.046
Try, as you might.
To keep us in a kitchen and in a drawing room.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.750
We will not rest.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.679
Until we are welcome in the universities,

11:36.840 --> 11:39.679
in the professions and in the voting booth.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.679
What are you staring at?

11:48.480 --> 11:52.319
Yes, l can see the wheels turning.
Pity l can't stay for the pronouncement.

11:54.285 --> 11:56.285
Charlotte!

11:58.160 --> 11:59.119
That woman was...

11:59.920 --> 12:00.919
Hysterical.

12:01.080 --> 12:01.879
Yes, quite.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.639
lt's a very difficult case, that one.

12:05.702 --> 12:06.474
Huh...

12:07.520 --> 12:10.359
I have worked at a number
of hospitals in the past...

12:10.800 --> 12:11.759
year.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.776
Guy's of course, Charing Cross.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.199
The Westminster Hospital, most recently...

12:16.360 --> 12:17.479
Excellent.

12:17.382 --> 12:17.759
-St Thomas's

12:17.760 --> 12:18.559
Old St Thomas's

12:19.120 --> 12:21.079
The popular Stepney sick asylum...

12:21.200 --> 12:22.799
Good. Impressive.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.759
...the diseases of the chest. Royal Sea Bathing Infirmary...

12:25.944 --> 12:27.119
Fine...fine.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.949
lt's...lt's a variety of experiences.

12:30.329 --> 12:32.319
But, tell me doctor...

12:32.880 --> 12:34.900
what do you know of hysteria?

12:34.959 --> 12:35.823
Huh...

12:39.000 --> 12:39.799
Nothing.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.199
Nothing?

12:42.280 --> 12:44.225
But it's a plague of our time.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.719
I would venture to say,
that half the women in London are affected.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.999
lt stands from an overactive uterus.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.439
In its most severe forms,
it demands drastic measures.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.839
institutionalization, surgery even.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.199
But in it's mildermanifestations:

13:00.360 --> 13:03.519
Nymphomania, frigidity,
melancholia, anxiety,

13:03.680 --> 13:04.999
it's eminently treatable.

13:05.160 --> 13:05.959
Interesting.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.119
Look. l'll come straight to the point, doctor.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.879
I'm keen for help.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.159
Oh, you saw my waiting room.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.719
Not enough hands to do the work, so to speak.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.279
Sir, I would be enormously grateful

13:18.440 --> 13:21.576
for any position that allowed me
to offer relieve to my patients

13:21.680 --> 13:23.639
with little chance of killing them.

13:23.800 --> 13:27.199
I've treated thousands of cases,
and l've not lost a single patient.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.599
But I won't lie to you, Granville.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.200
lt's tedious, tiring work.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.159
Are you fit?

13:37.320 --> 13:41.999
I have never shook from hard work in the
pursuit of helping the most needy among us.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.679
Jolly good.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.679
Shall we say, umm...three pounds a week?

13:47.600 --> 13:48.938
Three pounds?

13:49.160 --> 13:51.639
Four.
Plus food and lodging.

13:52.120 --> 13:52.959
I accept.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.479
We're going to do great things together, Granville.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.919
Good God, what a grip.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.119
So, breakfast at eight, dinner at six.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.099
Your room is up...ahh...

14:07.560 --> 14:08.239
Emily.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.919
I want you to meet my new assistant.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.119
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.559
My daughter, Emily Dalrymple.

14:15.880 --> 14:16.959
Your servant, ma'am.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.039
So pleased to meet you, Dr. Granville.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.559
Emily is the angel of the house.

14:21.720 --> 14:25.999
Since the day that my wife, Melodia, passed away,
Emily has run things in proper order.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.879
Oh, and she's also quite a scientist in her own right.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.359
You boast, Father.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.359
Let me guess.

14:32.520 --> 14:33.159
Jollyty?

14:33.288 --> 14:34.584
[Both chuckles]

14:35.160 --> 14:35.999
Botany?

14:39.960 --> 14:41.039
Lepidopterology?

14:42.640 --> 14:43.800
Phrenology.

14:44.300 --> 14:48.253
-Phrenology...hahahaha...Yes.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.439
l can assure you Phrenology
is an accurate science, doctor.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.919
Yes. Besides emulation of the bump

14:54.080 --> 14:56.719
someone's head's a varied road map to the personality,

14:56.880 --> 14:58.159
if one is properly trained to read them.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.439
l don't mean to imply...

14:59.800 --> 15:02.039
l think a demonstration is in order

15:02.200 --> 15:03.599
for our young sceptic.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.039
it could be the most convivial.

15:05.680 --> 15:06.639
Please.

15:25.245 --> 15:26.245
What...

15:26.600 --> 15:29.959
Dr. Granville, you had the most
perfectly formed nimbus l've ever felt.

15:30.120 --> 15:30.759
nimbus?

15:31.040 --> 15:32.399
He is a man of great wisdom.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.319
l knew it. l knew it

15:33.480 --> 15:36.439
And your mastoid is...is very well pronounced.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.479
Doctor, you're quite sympathetic, aren't you?

15:38.640 --> 15:39.719
Umm...well...

15:39.880 --> 15:41.079
What else...what else?

15:41.543 --> 15:42.600
Oh...

15:42.920 --> 15:44.100
Oh, I'm so sorry.
-What?

15:44.120 --> 15:45.000
lt's just...

15:45.440 --> 15:47.999
Well your...your thrombus is so...rigid,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.600
so jotting and prominent, it startled me.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.222
Rigid thrombus?

15:52.519 --> 15:54.678
Sorry. Rigid thrombus?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.599
it augurs fame.

15:41.669 --> 15:57.696
No, no, no...

15:57.720 --> 16:00.759
While l have the utmost respect for your method, Miss Dalrymple

16:00.760 --> 16:02.999
l must complaint that you misread me.
l'm but a simple doctor.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.239
l have no ambition for notoriety.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.879
And l can assure you, your thrombus is the key to you future.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.039
Whether you seek it or not, Dr. Granville.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.159
You're destined for fame.

16:15.847 --> 16:16.847
Ahoy!

16:18.095 --> 16:19.095
Ahoy!

16:20.200 --> 16:21.239
Who is this?

16:22.360 --> 16:23.319
Who is this, please?

16:25.040 --> 16:27.000
Mr. Stanton...Huh.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.159
Can you hear me?

16:29.200 --> 16:30.799
Can you hear me now?

16:31.718 --> 16:32.718
Yes.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.201
This is Edmund St. John Smythe.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.079
No, I don't work at
the telephone exchange. You see...

16:39.240 --> 16:42.141
l've installed this telephone and l wanted to test it

16:42.240 --> 16:45.212
you're the only person
they could connect me to. Haha...

16:45.160 --> 16:47.533
How're things going over there?

16:47.880 --> 16:51.536
Sound's thrilling. Very well.
Carry on then. Goodbye.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.719
Do you realize?
l have been speaking to a barrister

16:54.720 --> 16:56.439
on the other side of London.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.399
What about it?

16:57.560 --> 16:58.719
Nothing. l don't even know the job.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.479
Nothing to value if you
have nothing to speak about.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.639
Here l am in Grosvenor Square,
and he's miles away

17:03.640 --> 17:06.319
yet, we're able to speak
to each other instantaneously.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.556
Do you think they'll catch on?

17:07.599 --> 17:09.959
l have no idea.
But imagine if everyone had one.

17:09.786 --> 17:10.786
Right.

17:11.599 --> 17:12.358
Well...

17:12.880 --> 17:17.992
l have just been offeedr a position
by London'0s leading specialist in women's medicine.

17:17.993 --> 17:18.992
Oh, God...

17:18.359 --> 17:20.039
How ghastly for you.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.199
When do you start?

17:22.720 --> 17:23.559
Tomorrow.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.031
Quite looking forward to it, actually.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.079
Who is she?

17:29.360 --> 17:30.079
What?

17:31.337 --> 17:32.337
Hmm?

17:33.440 --> 17:34.562
She's his daughter.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.839
Emily Dalrymple.
l've only met her briefly, but...

17:38.000 --> 17:38.759
But what?

17:39.240 --> 17:41.239
Oh, Edmund. She is magnificent.

17:41.880 --> 17:45.159
The epitome of English virtue and...

17:45.920 --> 17:47.319
Womanliness.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.239
I haven't the hope.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.079
Huh. Handsome, young doctor.
What more could a woman ask?

17:52.240 --> 17:53.639
Huh, better income. Social equal.

17:53.880 --> 17:54.679
Overrated.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.439
A few laughs, stiff pricks. That's all a woman wants.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.999
And you know this because?

18:00.080 --> 18:01.199
Oh, l've read it in a magazine.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.319
Oh, l see.

18:02.840 --> 18:06.279
A toast then. To the end of
Dr. Mortimer Granville, once a brilliant student,

18:06.760 --> 18:09.719
most recently, a visionary doctor to the poor,

18:09.880 --> 18:13.359
and now, handmade to anxious middle-aged women.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.119
Edmund St. John Smythe.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.359
Bachelor.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.439
Benefactor. Miserable student.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.479
Sometimes drunkard.
Full time sexual deviant and

18:21.640 --> 18:23.159
supreme waster of time and money,

18:23.320 --> 18:25.879
especially if it has anything to do with the science of electricity.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.079
- To the telephone.
- To the Queen.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.159
To calling the Queen on the telephone.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.399
Morning, Mrs. Parsons.

18:49.560 --> 18:50.679
Oh, good morning, Doctor.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.959
This is Dr. Granville.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.599
He'll be assisting me this morning.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.358
Very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Parsons.

18:56.359 --> 18:57.012
Doctor...

18:57.280 --> 18:59.079
Notice the general pallor.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.439
And how are we
this morning, Ms. Parsons?

19:01.600 --> 19:02.759
Still feeling anxious?

19:02.920 --> 19:04.639
yes, quite anxious, doctor.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.999
I've been having those distracting thoughts we discussed all week.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.079
Yes.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.159
Throughout history,

19:12.320 --> 19:15.519
the medical establishment just
offered hysterical women

19:15.680 --> 19:18.079
a veritable small respond order of treatments.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.879
Warm baths, ice baths, water jets,

19:21.040 --> 19:22.439
mesmerisation,

19:22.600 --> 19:23.719
horseback riding even.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.319
But, l favour

19:26.000 --> 19:27.879
a more direct approach.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.045
Now, l like to begin

19:30.920 --> 19:32.839
with a drop of musk oil...

19:34.440 --> 19:36.519
followed by oil of lilies.

19:36.841 --> 19:37.841
good dollop.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.679
Are you ready, Mrs. Parsons?

19:44.840 --> 19:47.658
Yes...yes, doctor. Quite ready.

19:48.117 --> 19:49.117
Ooh...

19:49.480 --> 19:52.079
Now, you begin with the index finger.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.999
Applying gentle pressure.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.679
And slowly...

19:56.320 --> 19:58.479
slowly in a circular motion,

20:00.360 --> 20:01.839
still pressing gently.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.239
lt's a bit like tapping your head
and rubbing your tummy at the same time.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.719
But you certainly get the hang of it.

20:11.960 --> 20:16.399
Vulva massage was popularized by Pieter Van Forest in the 16th century.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.959
Who prescribed it
most especially for widows

20:19.480 --> 20:21.159
and women of religious orders.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.199
- No offense, Mrs. Parsons.
- None taken, Doctor.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.479
But today, in a clinical
environment with a trained professional

20:26.640 --> 20:29.719
this is the most direct,
most effective treatment we can offer.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.559
Good steady pressure.
That's the key.

20:33.480 --> 20:36.199
Oh...Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.839
Of course,
reapply oil as needed.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.239
Notice the effect, Doctor?

20:49.880 --> 20:51.239
Shortness of breath.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.039
Blushing of the skin.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.719
Fluttering of the eyelids,

20:56.160 --> 20:56.799
twitching.

20:56.960 --> 20:57.919
Mourn crimson.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.279
Vocalization. All perfectly normal.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.719
Merely, involuntary
physiological reaction to the treatment.

21:04.840 --> 21:05.759
Oh...Oh, come on!

21:06.000 --> 21:06.959
Come on, boy!

21:07.120 --> 21:07.999
Up and over!

21:08.160 --> 21:09.879
Steady on, Mrs. Parsons. Steady on.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.919
Put steady pressure.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.239
That's the key of it all.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.679
Tally-ho!

21:19.138 --> 21:20.138
Tally-ho!

21:20.480 --> 21:22.207
Steady she goes, Mrs. Parsons.

21:22.559 --> 21:23.559
Steady she goes

21:23.700 --> 21:29.180
ls she's by fierce external stimulation,
we're able to elicit the pain pleasure reaction,

21:29.040 --> 21:31.519
there by inducing the hysterical paroxysm,

21:31.680 --> 21:34.079
and causing the uterus back to its normal position.

21:34.760 --> 21:35.519
Amazing.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.719
The female organ is as you know

21:37.880 --> 21:41.799
incapable of experiencing
any pleasurable sensation what so ever

21:42.000 --> 21:44.759
without actual penetration,
of the male organ.

21:45.018 --> 21:46.018
Arghhh...

21:51.080 --> 21:52.679
As you can see, Granville.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.239
A very satisfactory paroxysm.

21:58.040 --> 22:02.639
Well, l think we can judge this treatment a great success,
What do you say, Mrs. Parsons?

22:03.400 --> 22:04.999
Startling, Dr. Dalrymple.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.959
How a full demonstration.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.679
And those nagging thoughts?

22:13.240 --> 22:14.799
Gone, Doctor.

22:15.200 --> 22:15.959
Wonderful.

22:16.642 --> 22:17.642
Wonderful.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.919
So, same time next week.

22:19.778 --> 22:20.778
Umm...

22:20.880 --> 22:23.279
Same time tomorrow, l should say.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.290
Moderation in all things, Mrs. Parsons.

22:27.324 --> 22:29.200
Moderation in all things.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.439
ls that you, Sarah?

22:35.000 --> 22:35.959
Hello.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.119
Ow...missed me, Charlie!

22:46.120 --> 22:47.319
Sauce, sir?

22:47.480 --> 22:49.079
It's lovely with the fish.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.119
Thank you.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.519
My father was the Anglican minister
of Mortlake.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.359
Unfortunately, he and mother
perished in the last cholera outbreak.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.919
when l was a boy.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.959
After coming to London to volunteer,
they contracted the disease themselves.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.519
Oh, how dreadful.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.679
Oh, terrible.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.999
No doubt that's where you came your interest in medicine.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.999
Lord St. John Smythe,
knew of my fate and without thought of the cost,

23:16.160 --> 23:18.599
brought me into his own home
and provided for my welfare and education.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.319
Just what you'd expect from a man of his standing.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.919
There is no greater charity
than the gift of education.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.559
You read the book of Samuel Smiles?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.519
ls there anyone more sensible,
more supremely British.

23:32.120 --> 23:32.759
Quite.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.279
Music, philosophy,

23:36.440 --> 23:37.319
phrenology,

23:37.480 --> 23:39.359
you're woman of many talents MissDalrymple.

24:00.240 --> 24:03.133
lt's through generosity, through compassion,

24:03.134 --> 24:05.159
through simple Christian kindness,

24:05.160 --> 24:07.559
and England gospel is spread
through all those who hunger...

24:07.920 --> 24:09.279
Hello, Father.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.239
l'm so sorry l'm late.

24:11.240 --> 24:12.237
Charlotte...

24:12.680 --> 24:14.239
Emily, hello. Love you.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.439
Good evening, Charlotte.

24:15.600 --> 24:16.959
Molly, hello?

24:17.120 --> 24:18.319
Staying out of trouble, l heard?

24:18.480 --> 24:19.959
Most days, miss. Wine?

24:20.120 --> 24:21.159
Yes, please.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.959
You remember my daughter, Charlotte Dalrymple...

24:23.882 --> 24:26.177
Daughter?
-My new assistant, Dr. Mortimer Granville.

24:26.178 --> 24:28.239
Oh, hello. Lovely to meet you properly.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.029
Careful not to prick yourself, Doctor.

24:32.030 --> 24:33.030
What...oh!

24:35.520 --> 24:37.679
You are aware that the dinner begin at six.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.159
l'm so sorry.

24:39.520 --> 24:43.519
Lizzie Burke had her eighth baby today. A little girl.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.359
She was turn the wrong way
around, it took forever to get her out.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.799
It was unbelievable.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.559
Must we speak of such things at table?

24:51.040 --> 24:51.919
Emily.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.759
Dr. Granville.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.239
How is your fish?

24:57.960 --> 24:59.879
Very fresh and very flaky, thank you.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.479
And Emily, are the parsnips to your liking?

25:02.640 --> 25:03.799
Oh...that's enough, Charlotte.

25:03.840 --> 25:06.719
Only trying to make the conversation sufficiently benign.

25:07.920 --> 25:08.799
Dr. Granville

25:08.960 --> 25:09.959
What say you?

25:10.880 --> 25:14.039
Childbirth. Nasty, uncomfortable
topic best avoided at supper

25:14.200 --> 25:16.279
or a miracle of life suited for any setting?

25:16.440 --> 25:19.839
l believe that serious medical matters,
are best left to those who're trained in them.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.679
The lane Doctor remind me,
but can only study his scalpel with a quart of gin.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.639
What say you, then?

25:26.880 --> 25:30.199
Charlotte is the mistress at the
Eastern Settlement, House of Heaven for the less fortunate.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.399
yes, unfortunately,
the experience's left her without a sense of

25:33.560 --> 25:34.999
punctuality or decorum.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.759
Oh, that's probably true.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.079
l suppose l should've said to Lizzie,
"Hold tight darling,

25:39.240 --> 25:41.679
won't be a minute. Just got to pop home.
Mustn't be late for supper"

25:41.960 --> 25:43.599
l don't know why you bother coming here at all

25:43.880 --> 25:45.919
if your sole intention is to be disruptive.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.679
lt isn't my sole intention.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.839
We're out of coal again
and l need ten pounds.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.279
No, no, no, no.

25:52.440 --> 25:56.908
I already told you yesterday,
l'm not giving you any further support in that regard.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.079
l know you did but
l didn't think you mean it.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.559
Well if that what it takes to
bring to your senses, so be it.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.519
l've been dodge you too long.

26:04.200 --> 26:06.559
l've allowed you to roam the
street of London late at night.

26:06.720 --> 26:09.719
Streets that l would be frighten
to go into in broad daylight.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.239
l've taken into my own home the employer...

26:13.400 --> 26:16.397
inexperience maid at your request. But no more.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.439
Then father please give me my dowry.

26:19.318 --> 26:20.318
Haha...

26:20.600 --> 26:24.131
What...To be wasted on
prostitutes and factory workers? l don't think so.

26:24.132 --> 26:25.119
No, no. Not until you marry.

26:25.280 --> 26:28.439
I would rather offer
myself to a band of ravenous Cossacks.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.439
-The parsnips are delicious. Are they not?

26:30.680 --> 26:33.079
l do find they work wonderfully
with the fish. Don't you think?

26:33.520 --> 26:37.559
it's not the Middle Ages.
She will able to marry whoever she pleases.

26:37.788 --> 26:39.639
No! lt's not proper.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.319
Now you give up this settlement house
and step up to your responsibility.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.199
And until you do so,
l will not give you another penny.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.559
And l won't come here anymore.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.639
Not the charity or the company.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.359
And you may threaten me with privation, with bankruptcy,

26:54.520 --> 26:56.799
with a life that knows only hunger and squalor.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.919
But l shall never veer, from what l know

27:00.080 --> 27:01.279
to be my own true path.

27:03.560 --> 27:04.439
And don't slam...

27:09.520 --> 27:11.159
Does she slam every door?

27:12.360 --> 27:14.159
Very difficult case, that one.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.839
Good night, Doctor.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.839
How is it, Miss Dalrymple that...

27:23.000 --> 27:25.079
you are so much the ideal one.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.719
And your sister is so...

27:29.440 --> 27:30.599
so volatile?

27:31.080 --> 27:33.399
well, l'm hardly ideal, Doctor. And...

27:34.520 --> 27:35.879
Charlotte, she just...

27:36.480 --> 27:37.959
feels everything so strongly.

27:39.440 --> 27:43.999
lf you truly knew her, you would see she's
terribly clever and wonderfully charitable

27:44.640 --> 27:49.319
If she's earn such love and admiration
from one so kind and gentle as yourself,

27:50.000 --> 27:51.679
l should never speak faultily of her.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.159
Good night, Doctor.

27:56.720 --> 27:57.999
Good night, Miss Dalrymple.

28:23.640 --> 28:24.599
Don't, Frank.

28:26.600 --> 28:27.679
How are you, this morning?

28:28.080 --> 28:30.599
We doing fine.
He just misses his mother.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.856
You know what...l was thinking about you this morning.

28:33.857 --> 28:35.374
Do you know what we going to start with?

28:35.840 --> 28:36.799
Drawing.

28:54.840 --> 28:55.679
Pardon me.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.799
lt's quite alright, handsome.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.119
Molly, is it?

28:59.857 --> 29:00.857
That's right, sir.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.199
But my friends call me Molly the Lolly.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.359
And l think that we can be friends.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.199
Molly the Lolly.
That's an unusual nickname.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.679
Fancy a lick?

29:12.600 --> 29:13.759
No, no. Thank you.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.519
Only six buck for the gentlemen like yourself.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.279
lt will only take me a minute.

29:17.520 --> 29:21.039
Well, lt's a generous offer, l'm sure.
But l have a very busy day ahead of me.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.104
So, so, so...perhaps another time, okay?

29:24.120 --> 29:27.371
No, no, no. What l mean to say is...

29:27.600 --> 29:28.479
Will if you excuse me.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.079
Suit yourself.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.239
You alright, Fannie?

29:44.257 --> 29:45.257
Yeah...

29:45.160 --> 29:45.999
lt's nothing.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.359
Fannie, what is it? What?

29:50.440 --> 29:51.399
lt's George.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.039
Again.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.359
l think he's gonna land us on the street.
This time

29:58.960 --> 30:01.519
- Oh, no, no, miss. l can't
- No, take it. Take it.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.559
Straight to the landlord.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.399
No stopping.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.359
l'll see you tonight.

30:14.640 --> 30:15.639
Mrs. Bellamy, is it?

30:16.560 --> 30:19.719
I'm Dr. Granville, Dr. Dalrymple new associate.
Good morning.

30:20.040 --> 30:21.199
Very pleased to meet you, Doctor.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.706
You've been here before?
- Yes.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.879
So you are aware of the procedure?

30:25.040 --> 30:25.839
lndeed.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.658
Going well?

30:29.920 --> 30:31.039
Yes, quite. Thank you.

30:31.560 --> 30:35.820
As l said before, l'm leaving you
in very good hands, Mrs. Bellamy.

30:36.127 --> 30:37.127
Oh..hahaha...

30:37.128 --> 30:38.399
Thank you, doctor.

30:38.471 --> 30:39.471
Good day.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.359
Shall we begin?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.079
Sorry about that.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.799
- You alright, Doctor?
- Yes, quite. Thank you.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.039
Here we go, then.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.252
Please let me know if
anything is uncomfortable.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.439
That's very nice, Doctor. Thank you.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.719
Very nice, indeed.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.439
Don't you understand? lt's an emergency.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.759
The situation is desperate.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.439
lt's completely impossible, madam.

32:33.680 --> 32:34.759
l'll do anything.

32:40.353 --> 32:41.353
Mille grazie.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.799
You are very welcome, Signora.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.239
Next.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.159
You knew they turning patients away.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.839
Really? l hadn't notice.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.199
l think because of you.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.399
This may be broken.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.519
Something wrong with your hand?

33:13.720 --> 33:14.839
Just a twinge.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.119
Allow me.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.639
You seem to have settled in nicely, Dr. Granville.

33:44.920 --> 33:48.159
Now, you may have noticed that l'm
not getting any younger.

33:48.720 --> 33:49.919
And with only two daughters,

33:50.080 --> 33:52.239
l have no one to carry on the practice.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.199
l was wondering whether you might like to consider

33:57.920 --> 33:59.279
becoming a partner.

33:59.300 --> 34:02.079
Papa, that's a wonderful idea.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.239
l...l'm speechless.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.639
And who knows if things go well,
this practice may end up yours.

34:11.840 --> 34:14.799
Since my dear wife Melodia, passed away...

34:15.500 --> 34:16.678
God rest her soul.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.918
Emily has diligently and professionally managed the household.

34:22.920 --> 34:26.559
l've no doubt that one day
she would make a fine Doctor's wife,

34:27.679 --> 34:29.199
with that experience.

34:50.120 --> 34:50.958
Lovely.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.879
l do hope l'm not expected
to stay here until after supper, everyday.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.679
l'm very sorry, Ms. Smalley,
l'll be on schedule tomorrow. l promise.

35:32.840 --> 35:33.879
l do hope so.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.519
Right. Just in here.

35:36.720 --> 35:37.639
We'll sit you down.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.839
Miss Dalrymple, what a surprise?
l'm afraid that your father isn't here.

35:41.000 --> 35:41.599
Good.

35:41.880 --> 35:44.479
Well in that case l must tell you
that we work only to appointment.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.479
Fannie has broken her ankle.
l was hoping to persuade you to treat it?

35:47.640 --> 35:48.879
l'll have the fish n chips.

35:49.360 --> 35:52.319
That's the rum talking.
lt's all l had to ease the pain.

35:52.480 --> 35:56.039
Normally l don't recommend extreme drunkenness,
but it's probably a very good choice.

35:56.079 --> 35:57.079
Let have a look at it.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.079
l should tell you, we've no money.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.039
Good night, Mrs. Smalley.

36:02.720 --> 36:03.519
Oh..Good night.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.786
Let's take her inside.
- Thank you.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.279
l'm not wearing any knickers.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.439
Well, l'm sure it's an honest mistake.

36:15.760 --> 36:16.799
You want to look?

36:18.120 --> 36:20.079
- What are these for?
- I'll explain later.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.773
There we go.
- Lie back.

36:22.960 --> 36:23.719
Very good.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.000
Now, Fannie...
- Yes.

36:26.040 --> 36:28.639
l want you to count to three for me.
Can you do that?

36:28.800 --> 36:29.759
Yes, l think so.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.279
One,

36:32.040 --> 36:32.719
two...

36:32.800 --> 36:34.079
Owww!!

36:34.080 --> 36:36.559
You said three, bloody hell!

36:39.040 --> 36:40.199
She's out, l think.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.599
Forgive me. l wanted her thoughts elsewhere.

36:42.760 --> 36:44.519
l need some plaster, for her ankle.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.759
I didn't know my father had any
proper medical supplies in here anymore.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.159
Crimean War's supplies l imagine.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.039
Is your hand alright?

37:04.520 --> 37:05.679
A bit stiff actually.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.559
Why are you so opposed to your father?

37:10.320 --> 37:11.479
My father...

37:12.280 --> 37:14.639
You know he's never been
to the settlement house.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.559
l simply wish he helped people
like Fannie who really need it

37:18.720 --> 37:20.479
lnstead of the trivial work he does here.

37:20.640 --> 37:21.799
lt's hardly trivial.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.639
That one is a little bit sloppy, thank you nurse.

37:23.800 --> 37:24.919
I apologize.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.239
Hysteria is a disabling condition
suffered by half the women in this city.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.719
Keeps you busy, l see.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.159
Does wonders for disagreeable personalities.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.599
You find me disagreeable?

37:33.760 --> 37:36.559
l've only ever seen you shout at people and slam doors.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.759
At least l've got the courage of my convictions.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.639
And few friends, l would imagine?

37:45.640 --> 37:46.319
Good.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.279
Well, l'need to see you again

37:48.440 --> 37:50.239
in six weeks, Fanny, to remove the cast.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.479
Thank you, Doctor.

37:51.880 --> 37:53.079
Yes, you've been a great help.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.439
You're both very welcome.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.759
lf you ever get bored, of nervous housewives

37:57.920 --> 37:59.959
feel free to pay us a visit.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.959
Hello, Mortimer.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.039
Please, sit down.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.100
Emily...

38:19.120 --> 38:20.286
l've been...Oh, Emily...

38:21.360 --> 38:22.559
l've been thinking...

38:24.840 --> 38:27.879
should things progress
as your father suggested

38:28.040 --> 38:29.959
and l one day l inherit the practice,

38:30.120 --> 38:32.799
what would your feelings be, about...

38:34.680 --> 38:36.199
well, an arrangement?

38:39.880 --> 38:40.679
Mortimer...

38:43.160 --> 38:44.409
l should be honoured.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.719
Most especially as it will make father so happy.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.599
Right...right.

38:53.726 --> 38:55.727
Umm...

38:55.760 --> 38:56.959
Oh, that's settled.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.302
Duty first, as always, Emily.

39:03.520 --> 39:06.719
Life is of little value unless it be consecrated by duty.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.159
Oh...Quite, yes.

39:25.000 --> 39:25.719
Granville.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.199
A word?

39:36.640 --> 39:40.639
l must insist that you give Charlotte
no further assistance of any sort.

39:41.160 --> 39:45.479
lt merely prolongs her relationship
with those people and that place.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.199
The woman had a broken ankle.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.679
l admire your dedication, Doctor.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.679
But we can't have day labours
trade things through the office.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.279
This is a very exclusive

39:55.280 --> 39:59.296
and l might add, lucrative practice.
Appearances matter.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.789
l have taken a solemn oath, Sir.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.060
l thought we had an understanding, you and l...

40:05.120 --> 40:07.212
about your future here.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.239
That's last of it, Miss.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.159
Oh, Jack. Thank you.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.500
Well, then. lt's a two hundred late today

40:20.600 --> 40:22.319
plus what's on account...

40:23.000 --> 40:24.489
three carry to one...

40:24.880 --> 40:25.919
seven and six, l think.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.800
Yes...yes, that's right.
May l pay you Friday next?

40:28.880 --> 40:30.879
l'm sorry, miss. But the gov is very clear.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.208
Cash only, he said. And, get the balance.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.759
Would you tell your employer,

40:38.520 --> 40:40.599
that my father, Dr. Dalrymple,

40:40.960 --> 40:45.279
has absolutely promised a very large donation
to the settlement house this coming Friday

40:45.440 --> 40:47.119
and l'll will bring him the money myself.

40:47.800 --> 40:48.959
l'll make it state, miss.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.799
Nobody appreciates more
than me what you've done here.

40:51.960 --> 40:53.439
My boy, Frank says you're the
strawberries and the cream.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.297
Shush...Friday, then.
- Ta!

40:58.844 --> 41:00.844
Mortimer...must you wear that ghastly hand brace?

41:01.600 --> 41:04.519
l must find some way to attend
to these women properly.

41:04.680 --> 41:08.119
l believe the French have
quite a bit of luck using their tongues.

41:08.560 --> 41:11.359
Please be serious.
We're speaking of my patients.

41:11.800 --> 41:12.799
They need me.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.359
Perhaps for the first time, l feel...

41:16.040 --> 41:17.199
truly useful.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.119
Aren't you a rainy day?

41:20.280 --> 41:22.479
Oh, don't worry, something will come along, simply...
- Oww!!

41:23.840 --> 41:25.359
l wish l could share your optimism.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.439
Oh...Excuse me.

41:30.973 --> 41:31.973
Just...just...

41:33.120 --> 41:34.831
Dr. Granville.
- Oh...

41:36.400 --> 41:38.399
- Are you all right?
- Yes, l think so.

41:40.517 --> 41:41.517
Thank you.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.180
Have you quite finished, Doctor?

41:47.240 --> 41:48.919
Edmund, this is Emily's sister Charlotte.

41:49.080 --> 41:50.359
Charlotte Dalrymple,

41:51.000 --> 41:52.519
Edmund St. John Smythe.

41:52.920 --> 41:55.400
Oh, Edmund Smythe from the papers.

41:55.520 --> 41:56.919
Overblown...l assure you

41:57.080 --> 42:02.955
l attended that party as a favour to a dear friend and l can swear l never met that horse before in my life.

42:03.160 --> 42:05.239
Sounds as if you had a jolly good time.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.359
What brings you to the west-end, Miss Dalrymple?

42:08.520 --> 42:10.159
Begging for money, unsuccessfully till now.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.199
Ah, yes. Miss Dalrymple runs a settlement house in the east end .

42:13.360 --> 42:14.039
How fascinating.

42:14.720 --> 42:15.959
l must be going.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.399
Oh, that seems as your hand's no better.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.679
lt must be difficult pleasuring
half the women in the city.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.319
Madam, pleasure has nothing to do with it.
l can assure you

42:24.480 --> 42:27.399
Well l suppose that depends on whether
your rave at the table or on it.

42:30.560 --> 42:31.439
Goodbye.

42:39.240 --> 42:41.759
You know how much we admire your spirit, Charlotte.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.159
And we're lifelong friends of your father.

42:44.320 --> 42:47.279
But these element you work with
are nothing more than

42:47.440 --> 42:50.679
the draught horses of society.
l don't see how charity will help...

42:50.840 --> 42:53.560
lt's not charity, perhaps a loan.

42:53.720 --> 42:55.279
A loan? How much?

42:55.440 --> 42:56.239
Two hundred pounds.

42:57.880 --> 43:01.099
Generally, a loan has some security, dear.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.999
They were my mother's.
They should cover the balance and more.

43:06.720 --> 43:09.719
We will give you two hundred pounds at eight percent interest.
- Thank you.

43:10.320 --> 43:13.679
Now l want you to be sure you
understand this is strictly business, Charlotte.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes

43:13.840 --> 43:15.159
We won't hesitate to collect...

43:15.320 --> 43:16.519
l understand.

43:16.960 --> 43:17.919
Thank you.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.319
Mr. Huddleston.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.599
Thank you. Thank you for your time and your generous...

43:21.760 --> 43:23.919
Mrs. Huddleston, thank you.

43:24.080 --> 43:26.919
lt means a great deal to so many people.

43:28.019 --> 43:29.350
Thank you, thank you.

43:30.840 --> 43:32.319
Scandalous...

44:11.040 --> 44:11.999
Hello?

44:13.880 --> 44:15.199
Dr. Granville...

44:16.720 --> 44:18.319
Trolling for patients?

44:18.480 --> 44:21.039
Afraid you finding cases of hysteria here.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.279
Women are all too busy trying to find enough to eat.

44:23.960 --> 44:26.479
Miss Dalrymple. Always speaking out of turn.

44:26.640 --> 44:29.412
No. l come to enquire about
Miss Fanny broken ankle.

44:30.520 --> 44:31.919
A house call?

44:33.000 --> 44:35.239
Surely, there's no harm following up with the patient?

44:36.680 --> 44:37.799
None at all.

44:46.880 --> 44:47.879
No pain?

44:48.080 --> 44:49.039
No. Nothing.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.279
l was going to take her to see you on Friday.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.039
There's no bother.
l was in the neighbourhood.

44:53.880 --> 44:55.801
l was...l was near the neighbourhood.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.706
- How's that feel?
- Fine, thank you Doctor.

44:58.800 --> 45:00.239
Would you like a cup of tea, Doctor?

45:00.400 --> 45:01.079
Oh, no, thank you.

45:01.240 --> 45:02.959
Dr. Granville. lt's the least we can offer.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.959
Yes. Alright then.
Cup of tea would be lovely.

45:07.360 --> 45:09.459
Take it easy on that for a few days.
- Yes, Doctor.

45:09.520 --> 45:12.079
Very good. Now wait for me in a moment.
You can wait just through there.

45:51.358 --> 45:52.358
Hello...

45:52.360 --> 45:53.079
Hang on.

45:53.920 --> 45:55.639
Just getting to the good bit.

46:04.320 --> 46:07.279
Thank you. l wouldn't be able to sleep
without knowing how that turn out.

46:07.720 --> 46:10.067
Milk, Doctor?
- Please.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.599
We use this room mostly as a nursery.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.879
l do fit in a little bit of teaching now and then.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.599
Promoting some aggressive political agenda, no doubt.

46:17.760 --> 46:18.959
Sums and letters mostly.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.199
Occasionally we sneak in something slightly progressive.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.519
Oh...you might like this.
Actually look. For example...

46:27.040 --> 46:29.279
this is where the children wash their hand.

46:29.440 --> 46:30.479
We use soap

46:30.640 --> 46:33.759
and boiled water. We do our best
to keep the settlement sanitary, but...

46:33.960 --> 46:36.759
you can't imagine the filth and the germs.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.159
You know about germs?

46:38.600 --> 46:40.319
l do read, Doctor.

46:40.800 --> 46:44.559
l spend years trying to convinced the medical
establishment that the hand washing prevent disease

46:44.720 --> 46:46.039
and unsuccessfully.

46:46.200 --> 46:47.679
and then here you are teaching it to the children.

46:47.840 --> 46:48.959
And with great success.

46:49.280 --> 46:53.879
l know. With the parents is another story.
But, eventually the children will teach them themselves.

46:54.222 --> 46:55.222
Bravo.

46:56.160 --> 47:00.559
For the women, we're trying to provide
services that will offer the most direct result.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.719
Good hot meal, safe place for
their children and communal laundry.

47:03.880 --> 47:07.039
l think that if we can ease their work load a bit We could get on to the important

47:07.200 --> 47:09.439
work, of changing their minds.

47:10.120 --> 47:11.959
You Madam, are a socialist.

47:12.280 --> 47:13.319
A socialist?

47:14.200 --> 47:15.439
What if l am?

47:19.560 --> 47:21.559
Socialism, it isn't hard.

47:21.720 --> 47:24.679
lt's nothing more than a group pulling together.

47:24.840 --> 47:28.759
lf women pull together,
if they weren't so frightened,

47:29.000 --> 47:30.599
There's no telling what we could accomplish.

47:30.760 --> 47:33.999
ln this revolution that you're planning,
will you achieved it all from here?

47:34.400 --> 47:36.839
Drop a stone in a pond, then it will main rippled.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.439
lt's a bit like pond. lt is true. l know this.
- Yes.

47:40.880 --> 47:42.239
The building adjacent,

47:43.160 --> 47:46.385
and the one behind,
are both for sale for two thousand pounds.

47:46.400 --> 47:50.100
Bought them together,
and we're not just a classroom and a kitchen

47:50.120 --> 47:51.999
we're centre for the neighbourhood with a garden,

47:52.520 --> 47:54.999
a proper school,
maybe even a medical clinic.

47:55.160 --> 47:57.679
And two thousand pounds,
is aiming quite high, don't you think?

47:57.680 --> 47:59.039
No, I don't think so.

47:59.800 --> 48:02.879
l know, by the time l'm gone,
women will have the vote

48:03.040 --> 48:06.159
they have equal education
and rights over their own bodies.

48:06.840 --> 48:09.359
and l'd like to play some small
part in making that happen.

48:09.360 --> 48:12.257
Absolutely. And then,
you should teach them how to fly.

48:12.480 --> 48:13.399
l would.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.679
You just wait and see, Doctor.

48:16.840 --> 48:19.479
l'd like to see your face.

48:20.480 --> 48:23.559
Your passion, your devotion to this work is admirable.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.159
Honestly,

48:25.600 --> 48:27.719
l get much more out of it than they do.

48:27.880 --> 48:30.519
They only get food and laundry
and l'm giving a useful life.

48:32.880 --> 48:34.079
And l set my own hours.

48:37.640 --> 48:38.479
You know...

48:39.720 --> 48:43.079
l could really use the help of
an able Doctor on a more regular basis.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.519
bread and apple for the least of it

48:46.680 --> 48:49.879
All the children suffer from malnutrition, scurvy,

48:50.040 --> 48:51.879
even cholera and typhus.

48:52.040 --> 48:53.599
All preventable as you know

48:53.760 --> 48:55.639
with the knowledge and resources.

48:56.480 --> 48:58.279
l'm afraid my patients keep me very busy.

48:58.680 --> 49:01.639
l only mean...
l only mean a weekend a month.

49:01.800 --> 49:03.759
l don't believe l would have the time.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.800
Or even a few hours on a Sunday. Anything would help.

49:06.960 --> 49:07.879
I'm sorry.

49:08.100 --> 49:10.685
Please. Please.
- Miss Dalrymple.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.679
l'm afraid l can't help.

49:13.760 --> 49:15.119
You can't...

49:16.120 --> 49:17.399
or you won't?

49:20.440 --> 49:22.119
lt's a bit more complex than that.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.679
l know, l know. lt's...

49:24.920 --> 49:27.319
lt's my father.
He wouldn't allow it, would he?

49:28.720 --> 49:30.319
ls that why you came here?

49:31.360 --> 49:34.319
To keep me from bringing Fannie
back to his posh little practice?

49:34.480 --> 49:35.519
Thank you for the tea.

49:39.480 --> 49:41.359
Run along Doctor. Back to your...

49:42.160 --> 49:43.799
silly comfortable life.

49:59.120 --> 50:00.639
Mrs. Castellari, Doctor.

50:01.040 --> 50:03.661
Send her in, Nurse.
- Mrs. Castellari.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.239
Mrs. Castellari, how are you?

50:06.400 --> 50:07.719
Sad, Doctore.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.519
Very sad today.

50:09.760 --> 50:11.679
Good, good.
Lie back, please.

50:26.471 --> 50:27.471
Aii!!!

50:27.680 --> 50:30.614
Your hand is so cold, Doctore.

50:31.120 --> 50:33.319
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Castellari.
I forgot.

50:38.749 --> 50:39.749
Yes.

50:43.160 --> 50:44.519
ls  that better?

51:01.400 --> 51:04.439
I think that's enough for today, Doctore.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.359
Feeling better, than?

51:10.783 --> 51:11.783
Mrs. Castellari!

51:12.649 --> 51:13.649
Mrs. Castellari!

51:14.160 --> 51:17.309
I assure you Mrs. Castellari,
this has never happened to me before.

51:21.240 --> 51:23.159
You have discredited my entire practice.

51:23.320 --> 51:24.199
l'm very sorry.

51:24.480 --> 51:26.599
Sorry will hardly suffice.

51:28.240 --> 51:32.119
Your disability is clearly far more serious
than you let me to believe.

51:32.320 --> 51:36.079
Ms. Castellari tells me you fail
to complete the treatment.

51:36.520 --> 51:37.799
And now,

51:37.960 --> 51:40.799
l discovered that Mrs. Parsons has stopped coming altogether.

51:41.200 --> 51:44.439
lf you could only see or wait while giving
me one more chance, l can assure you...

51:44.920 --> 51:45.599
No.

51:45.880 --> 51:47.839
l thought you were someone l could trust,

51:48.280 --> 51:50.039
with my business, my family,

51:50.880 --> 51:52.159
my reputation.

51:52.960 --> 51:55.134
But, clearly l was mistaken.

51:55.600 --> 51:56.679
You're dismissed.

51:57.760 --> 51:58.879
Doctor.
- Dismissed!

52:13.120 --> 52:14.359
l'm terribly sorry.

52:48.960 --> 52:50.319
l'm finished, Edmund.

52:51.040 --> 52:52.399
Completely buggered.

52:55.640 --> 52:59.319
l had a perfect life within reach and, l lost it.

53:00.360 --> 53:02.159
All due to hand cramps.

53:02.495 --> 53:04.447
[phone rings]

53:04.840 --> 53:05.599
God!

53:05.760 --> 53:07.039
Someone's telephoned.

53:07.880 --> 53:08.999
Ahoy!

53:11.920 --> 53:13.919
I didn't know you had a telephone.

53:15.040 --> 53:16.679
l'm very, very flattered. Yeah.

53:19.680 --> 53:20.959
Oh, yes, indeed.

53:34.480 --> 53:35.199
My God!

53:35.800 --> 53:38.239
Now l'm inventing a cleaning tool.

53:39.560 --> 53:40.919
Yeah, very good.

53:42.138 --> 53:43.138
Yes.

53:43.400 --> 53:44.359
Yeah, do that...

53:47.160 --> 53:49.622
Got to rush, actually now.
Goodbye.

53:56.840 --> 53:57.559
Oh...Don't stop.

53:58.440 --> 54:00.159
l think you're enjoying yourself too much.

54:00.880 --> 54:03.519
lt makes your hand feel all...all warm and tingling.

54:04.360 --> 54:05.999
l feel it right down to the bone.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.039
Oh, really?

54:07.800 --> 54:08.759
Turn it back on.

54:09.840 --> 54:10.959
Please...

54:21.480 --> 54:23.559
Well, that's what l call good steady pressure.

54:25.920 --> 54:26.759
Does it go any higher?

54:35.160 --> 54:35.919
Go on.

54:45.640 --> 54:47.479
That's it. That's the spot.

54:48.080 --> 54:48.999
My feathers!

54:53.800 --> 54:55.839
This is the spot, indeed.

55:01.800 --> 55:02.839
Bugger...

55:04.200 --> 55:05.519
You smell burning?

55:05.760 --> 55:09.319
But you said yourself that you
could feel the vibration deep inside...

55:09.480 --> 55:10.959
l know what l said.

55:11.120 --> 55:13.719
But this is crude and rough and inexact

55:13.880 --> 55:16.919
and nothing at all like
the motion and pressure that l use.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.839
Didn't seem to have much this time.

55:19.800 --> 55:20.439
l grant you.

55:20.600 --> 55:21.959
lf this works,

55:22.120 --> 55:25.359
it could put you back in good standing with Dr. Dalrymple and Emily.

55:25.520 --> 55:27.479
Edmund, let me be perfectly clear about this.

55:27.640 --> 55:28.759
We are not going to take

55:28.920 --> 55:32.599
a dangerous explosive and untried electrical device

55:32.760 --> 55:35.839
and press it against the ladies most gentle areas.

55:39.880 --> 55:40.919
That's it, then.

55:41.720 --> 55:44.639
l believe l shall regret this
to the very end of my days.

55:44.800 --> 55:46.879
Now, who should we try it on?

55:51.520 --> 55:53.919
Ordinarily for five pounds, l
wouldn't ask questions.

55:54.080 --> 55:56.679
That's with the men. This is a different kettle of fish.

55:56.840 --> 55:59.079
I don't believe it will involve any pain.
But if it does,

55:59.240 --> 56:00.359
we will stop immediately.

56:00.520 --> 56:01.519
Think of it this way, Molly.

56:01.680 --> 56:05.239
for one brief moment, you could be a
pioneer of technology.

56:05.960 --> 56:07.639
A voyage of the British Empire,

56:07.800 --> 56:11.982
and quite possibly, the
vanguard of modern medical science.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.479
And we pay up front.

56:14.280 --> 56:15.319
Why not?

56:36.520 --> 56:37.679
Do your worst.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.248
Ooh...
- Are you hurt?

56:49.249 --> 56:50.249
No.

56:50.120 --> 56:51.919
No. lt just scared me. That's all.

56:52.120 --> 56:53.279
I've never felt one like that before.

56:53.520 --> 56:54.759
Shall l stop?

56:54.920 --> 56:57.359
No, no. Try again.
l'll be ready this time.

57:11.920 --> 57:12.919
Oh, right there.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.279
Yes, like that.

57:50.360 --> 57:51.599
How do you feel, Molly?

57:52.840 --> 57:54.639
Bloody marvellous, what do you think?

57:55.280 --> 57:57.628
Would you say you had a paroxysm?

57:58.160 --> 58:00.039
l'd say three from conunting.

58:00.200 --> 58:01.959
lt got a little muddled in the middle.

58:05.520 --> 58:06.719
lt's astonishing.

58:08.240 --> 58:09.479
What you call that little thing?

58:10.480 --> 58:12.519
Well, l was calling it a feather duster.

58:13.920 --> 58:15.359
Well, let's think of something quick.

58:15.520 --> 58:17.319
So the girls know what to ask for.

58:18.640 --> 58:19.919
Whore's feathers?

58:20.080 --> 58:22.279
l give you my word as a gentleman, sir.

58:22.440 --> 58:25.519
Three paroxysms in five minutes.

58:25.920 --> 58:27.319
No harm came to the girl?

58:27.480 --> 58:30.079
She was completely satisfied with the result.

58:30.320 --> 58:32.879
Yes. Well, l can hardly take the word of a trollop.

58:33.240 --> 58:34.919
That's why we must try it here.

58:35.240 --> 58:37.679
Medical science demands a thorough investigation.

58:38.160 --> 58:42.079
What better place to start than with these women
whom we know suffer so from hysteria?

58:42.240 --> 58:45.359
Yes. Well, in my opinion, change is rarely beneficial.

58:46.040 --> 58:48.639
l believe we're on the verge
of something revolutionary, sir.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.079
lf we achieve half as much of your patients,

58:51.240 --> 58:52.959
all credit goes to you.

58:53.600 --> 58:55.679
Not just money, fame.

58:57.520 --> 59:00.039
Three paroxysms in five minutes, you say?

59:05.320 --> 59:07.279
Very well .
One test case.

59:07.600 --> 59:10.119
But if she comes to harm, on your head be it.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.399
The rubby-nubby.

59:12.560 --> 59:14.119
The vibratorium.

59:14.600 --> 59:15.799
Jigly-wigly?

59:16.720 --> 59:17.999
paroxysmator.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.839
Oh, the sorcerer's apprentice.

59:21.760 --> 59:24.119
- Excitetator?
- Mr. Wobleck.

59:25.160 --> 59:26.919
What about, the squealer?

59:35.760 --> 59:37.759
You gonna need a bigger appointment book.

59:41.600 --> 59:43.519
Electric massage?

59:44.080 --> 59:45.119
l don't know.

59:45.440 --> 59:48.999
l have full confidence that the
machine will equal if not better,

59:49.160 --> 59:50.719
any treatment you've had before.

59:50.880 --> 59:54.039
And, since you're so unsatisfied last time,

59:54.200 --> 59:56.359
l'm prepared to offer you this, gratis.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.919
l'll trust you, Doctore.

59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.519
This is Mr. Edmund St...

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.399
That is my electrical assistant.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.399
He'll be attending as well, if that's alright?

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.559
lt's a little surprising at first, Mrs. Castellari.
But don't be alarmed,

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.439
you'll soon get used to it.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.679
Everything all right, Mrs. Castellari?

01:01:52.851 --> 01:01:53.851
Bravo!

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.399
Well done.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.239
So, don't forget to chain the gate,

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.159
And, oh...l left the candle lit in the kitchen.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.039
Go, and have a lovely evening.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.919
You know, l think l will.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.359
Bye.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.119
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.039
Oh, l'm sorry. We're closing.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.159
- Get her out of there.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.759
Two hundred pounds plus interest,
or we lock the gate.

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.119
But l don't have it.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.639
Right. l'm locking the gate.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.359
Get of me!

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.625
No doubt, you're the luckiest man in all of London.
- Miss Dalrymple.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.159
Miss Charlotte Dalrymple.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.319
Will you excuse me, ladies?

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.119
Miss Dalrymple.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.359
Dr. Granville, good evening.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.119
Congratulations.
l'm sure you'll make my sister very happy.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.199
Something wrong?

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.359
No, no.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.999
l just never seen you so...

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.999
Formally attired?

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.319
l was going to say...

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:57.839
clean.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.559
Dr. Granville, l can assure you

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.644
that women enjoy physical pleasure just
as much as men,

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:12.319
even if it can be harsh to come by.
- Physical pleasure has nothing to do with it.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.159
lt is strictly a medical treatment that stimulates the nervous system.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.319
lndeed it does, doesn't it.
Bargain it to guinea.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.879
But my point is,

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.279
according to your diagnosis,
hysteria seems to cover everything,

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.439
from insomnia to toothache.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.420
lt's not my...
- lt's nothing more than a catch-all

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.420
for dissatisfied women.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.839
women, forced to spend
their lives on domestic chores

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.639
and their prudish and
selfish husbands who are unwilling

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.679
or unable to make love to them properly, or often enough.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.359
You seem to have strong opinions
on husbands for a woman who doesn't have one.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.399
Look, if you don't believe me,

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.319
ask your patients.

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.879
Faintly ironic, don't you think.
Use my engagement party

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.719
as an opportunity to deliver your opinion matters?
- Yes, yes.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:55.359
and l apologize for that, but you must admit,
you men really did get the best side to the bargain.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.199
Bargain?

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.639
For l said, lt's mindless housework and dating some halfwit

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.542
you can make some halfwit very happy.

01:05:00.542 --> 01:05:02.959
lt simply not enough for me, or for most women.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.279
Would it be enough for you?

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.119
l'm not most women.
Wouldn't you be lonely?

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.279
l will take a partner.
An equal.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.039
But, not for me a life of darning socks, doing chores

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.759
until my mental faculties become Sunday pudding.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.159
Does someone say Sunday pudding?

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.839
Lord and Lady St. John Smythe may l present

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.839
Miss Dalrymple.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.899
Miss Dalrymple, my guardians.
Lord and Lady St. John Smythe.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.719
Charlotte  "Sunday pudding" Dalrymple.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.880
So please to meet you, my dear.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.319
l love a good Sunday pudding.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.319
Cannot be happier for you, Mortimer.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.280
You make us proud, each and every day.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:36.999
Thank you.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.319
Lovely earrings.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.520
Oh, thank you. They were my mother's.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.558
Will your mother be joining us this evening?

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.239
No, my mother is in fact dead,
my Lord.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.858
l trust we didn't waste an invitation on her.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.600
What about your father?

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.800
Will he be here or is he dead as well?

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.679
No. My father is quite well. Thank you.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.582
l've not seen him but l'm sure he'll be here soon.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.279
Oh, hurry up. Damn you.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.399
Give a move on!

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.759
They only keep the love of your life waiting, my dear.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.119
A toast to the happy couple.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.840
You'll soon find that the key to a happy marriage

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:25.480
is the ability to enjoy a good argument.
- Yes.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.608
Do remember to let him win once in a while, my dear.

01:06:27.892 --> 01:06:29.599
Oh...Oh...no, no.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.239
There's a misunderstanding.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.373
l'd rather marry Edmund than Dr. Granville.

01:06:33.373 --> 01:06:34.639
Marry Edmund?

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.519
Sure, she's a live one.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.360
Who is this man?

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.359
That's my father.

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:51.740
l thought he was dead.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.879
May l present, Dr. Robert Dalrymple.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:54.679
My Lord.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.025
And this is my fiancée, Emily Dalrymple.

01:06:58.025 --> 01:06:59.199
Fiancée? But l thought...

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.126
Never mind, dear.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.399
How very nice to meet you, Doctor.
- My Lady

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:03.998
Miss Dalrymple.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.319
l do apologize for being so late.

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.239
That's quite alright.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.244
Your hair is the most adventurous, Emily.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.159
Oh, do you think so?

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.279
It took it so long to get it up there.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.639
Shall we do the once around.

01:07:19.351 --> 01:07:21.351
Well, yes.
- Excuse us.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.399
Port, Doctor?

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.199
Delightful.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.359
Tell me how you met our young
Mortimer?

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.869
Lovely party.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.999
Yes...yes, it is.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.199
What are your interests?

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.719
Music, l enjoy reading.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.759
Phrenology.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.239
Mortimer stay modest.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.479
Tell us how widen your accomplished, you are.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.679
Phrenology is a treasure map to
the personality if one is properly trained.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.919
We are licensing this machine
to doctors all over London.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.439
For a very generous royalty, of course.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.159
l despise business.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.325
So do l.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.671
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Huddleston. Come, let me introduce you.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:23.599
Good evening, Mr. Huddleston.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.999
Mrs. Huddleston, do you know Dr. Granville?

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.118
Not personally.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.040
Very nice to meet you.
- Charmed.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.359
Looks though You going to be getting
these earrings after all.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.719
You'll have to excuse us.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:35.959
l'm sorry.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.238
That was a little odd.

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:41.319
These earrings are the security against the loan for the settlement house for this due tomorrow.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.198
So this is my last night with them.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.198
They were your mother's.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.158
Yes, they were.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.759
You do what you must.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.559
l'm sure she would have approved.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.038
Bugger.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.545
Throughout history,

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.662
great English families
have gathered in halls such as this,

01:09:34.662 --> 01:09:36.639
to celebrate the impending nuptial...

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.078
Lord, save us.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.078
Tell me. What happened?

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.799
They came for the money,
I told them that l didn't have it...

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.279
Mr. Huddleston, what's the meaning of this?
you gave us until Monday.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:54.679
l no longer hold the note, Charlotte.
Your father does.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.720
Father?

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.359
Charlotte, calm down.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.159
l'm simply doing what's best for you.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.359
What are you doing?

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.199
l purchased the note from Mr. Huddleston,

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.319
and l'm closing down the settlement house.
You no longer have any debt...

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.168
These are the actions of a villain.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.599
Charlotte.
- Of a villain

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.480
This is your sister's engagement party.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.679
Party? She's bruised and bleeding.
You want me to consider a party?

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.159
Make way, please.

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.239
Leave her.
- This is a private party.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.879
You're not manhandling her.

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:25.919
Let me handle this.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:26.919
We've got this under control.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.079
l'm a doctor. l believe
this woman needs medical attention.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.399
l don't know that, sir, but l do know she's not staying.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.519
l haven't done anything wrong.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.799
Please stop. She's hurt.

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.999
Just please, Charlotte.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.479
lf we can discuss this like civilized men.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.759
Let me by.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:42.579
l said let me by.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.679
Damn.
Did l miss something?

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.119
l would never have imagine it will come to this.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.439
But we'll have to help her.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.519
There's nothing 'but', Emily.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.719
l tried indulging her, l tried a firm hand

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.680
l've met my worst end.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.479
Mortimer.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.839
Please, she's my sister.

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.407
What would you have me do?

01:11:42.407 --> 01:11:44.704
You must testify on her behalf.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.759
- And say what?
- The truth.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.319
That she's hysterical.

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.959
Sir, they will send her to a sanatorium.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.159
That's the only thing that will keep her out of prison.

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.800
Order!
Order!

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:25.039
This court will come to order.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.959
The facts are these, Your Honour.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.599
One fortnight ago,
the defendant, Charlotte Dalrymple,

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.425
in full view of witnesses,

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.479
assaulted a police Constable caring out his duty.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.255
If this were a first offense,

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.439
then a short prison sentence might suffice, but...

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.681
this isn't the first offence, is it Miss Dalrymple?

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.959
You're arrested last April

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.679
on public nuisance

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.134
and resisting arrest.

01:13:19.134 --> 01:13:22.879
Your honour, l was handing out
suffragette leaflets in Trafalgar Square

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.639
when two officers arrested me.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.679
The officers sworn statements read:

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.559
"Miss Dalrymple was asked
to leave the square,

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.239
where upon she started

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.959
to shout and jump about".

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:40.159
"When finally we did try to place her in handcuffs,

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.679
she resisted

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.479
most violently".

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.879
No. That is not true.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.359
You will speak only when questionrd, Miss Dalrymple.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.679
Well, how am l to defend myself against
his accusation if you won't let me speak?

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.279
ls there more?

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:53.799
l'm afraid there is, Your Honour.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.719
October 1879, solicitation.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.399
No, that was not me.

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.519
My friend, Molly...

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.511
she is a prostitute. She was a prostitute.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.119
She has since found gainful employment,

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.239
as a maid, in my father's house.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.359
Anything else, Mr. Squyers?

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:15.319
No, Your honour.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:18.159
No? Nothing else?
What's of the crime

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.079
of charity and compassion?

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:22.159
Very admirable l'm sure.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.919
Seems that the help included prostitution,
resisting arrest and

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.839
assaulting police officers.

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:32.719
One could only imagine that the cost to England,
should be sending university education to all her women .

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.200
Yes, it's very easy, isn't it?

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.239
to make fun of women's lives.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.079
I would like to see you,

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.639
walk for one mile in our shoes,

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.880
l imagine that your mirth would turn, first

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.219
to sympathy and then to despair.

01:14:48.219 --> 01:14:50.519
Be careful, Miss Dalrymple.
Your symptoms are showing.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.639
Until England fully recognizes

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.159
the worth and contributions of women,

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.919
will she'll be anything other than a second class country

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.279
despite all her wealth.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.679
That's enough, Miss Dalrymple.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.760
Your Honour,
Charlotte Dalrymple clearly suffers from

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.799
erratic, aggressive and violent emotions.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.239
That are best described, as incurable hysteria.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.279
To back truce my opinion, l would like to call

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.199
an expert witness, Your Honour.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.039
Proceed, Mr. Squyers.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.878
l would like to call Dr. Mortimer Granville,

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.359
lf it pleases the court.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.359
Mortimer Granville, please.

01:15:42.259 --> 01:15:44.259
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.319
Your Honour.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.120
The evidence you shall give shall be the truth,

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.960
the whole truth nothing but
the truth so help you God!

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.719
lt will.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.479
State your name.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:06.839
Mortimer Granville.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.911
Now, l'm sure we all, are well aware
of your celebrity, Doctor.

01:16:12.911 --> 01:16:16.788
But, if you wouldn't mind just telling us
a little of your professional experience.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.439
l'm a medical doctor whose practice consists
of treating women diagnosed with hysteria.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.919
And in this capacity,
how many women have you treated?

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:26.719
Hundreds, certainly.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.239
And always good results, l trust?

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.119
we've had few complaints of late.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.399
ls it true Dr. Granville that,

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.599
incurable cases of hysteria

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.157
demand institutionalization and surgical hysterectomy?

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.669
Please answer the question, Dr. Granville.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.599
Well, yes.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.879
Traditionally, yes.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.840
But only in the most severe,
most persistence cases...

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.279
Thank you, doctor.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.239
We have already address the...

01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:00.011
the persistence of Miss Dalrymple problem.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:05.639
ln your professional opinion, Doctor,
as an expert in the field of hysteria,

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.999
how would you describe Miss Dalrymple behaviour?

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.839
Without a doubt,

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.679
Charlotte Dalrymple is...

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.159
erratic,

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.559
and volatile,

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.319
and at times physically aggressive.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.639
She is also the most vexing woman l've ever met.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.079
Thank you, doctor.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.400
Your Honour, based on this evidence,

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.679
l find that, l must recommend

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:40.119
that Charlotte Dalrymple be remanded to the
chumps for the institute for the criminally insane.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.799
With a further recommendation

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.189
for immediate surgical hysterectomy.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.639
l wasn't quite finished.

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.647
Miss Dalrymple
is also the most generous, compassionate,

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:00.039
selfless and truly Christian

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.039
woman that l have ever met.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.759
Doctor, you just sworn that she is erratic,

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:06.959
volatile,

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.359
and even physically aggressive.

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.319
Would you not characterize that as hysterical?

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.679
Well, you see...

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.639
after consulting with my patients

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.319
and considerable reflection,

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.159
lt is my professional opinion

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.091
that hysteria is a fiction.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:27.639
lt's nothing but a...

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.359
a catch-all diagnosis for women without opportunity

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.719
forced to spend their life tending to domestic chores

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.959
and selfish, prudish husband who are

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.279
unwilling or unable

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.879
to make love to them properly.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.519
Or often enough.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.399
l beg your pardon, Doctor...

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:54.399
Your Honour,

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.199
the Constable suffered no grave injury.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.840
but great harm must still be done if
Miss Dalrymple is locked away and butchered.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:04.159
England will lose a devoted and singular woman

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.963
she can ill afford to spare.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.040
I grant you, there may not be room in the world

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:12.239
for more than one
Charlotte Dalrymple.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:14.879
Fortunately for all of us,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.319
l think they must've broken the mould.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.719
ln the case of Charlotte Dalrymple,

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:43.538
there are no easy answers.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.837
Mr. Squyers,

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.839
l find your case for hysteria

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.559
wanting.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.039
By your reasoning,
we should lock up every female in

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.120
whom whimsy and logic collide which

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.439
suggests me most of the women in England.

01:20:03.327 --> 01:20:04.327
My wife included.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.119
On behalf of that matter, however

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.879
l am loath to offer precedent
where

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.199
a policeman safety is being served.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:13.879
Miss Dalrymple,

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.319
for striking a police officer in the course of his duty,

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.227
l sentenced you to

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.997
thirty days in prison.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.239
and l want you

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.119
to think most carefully and act most cautiously in the future.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.679
Take her.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.519
Miss Dalrymple.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.239
Dr. Granville.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.718
suppose l know that you might be interestrd.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.119
That's an interesting offer,
something to meditate on while l consider a new career.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.839
Mortimer Granville, you're a good doctor, and you should remain one

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.200
lnstead of leaching and bleeding
people in cutting them up to no purpose

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.519
you, have invented a machine that does harm to no one

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:00.399
and makes anyone had comes into contact with to feel better.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:05.679
l should think there a very few doctors in history
that could have a glimpse of such accomplishment.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.239
You are a confounding woman.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.839
You're all fier and brimstone in one minute,
compliments and common sense the next.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.772
I am a woman like any other.

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.408
No, no. You're quite unlike any women l've ever met.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.423
Will you be alright?

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.165
l'm fine. l've got lots of friends in prison.

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:33.388
Mortimer

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.639
Thought l might find you here.

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.439
l've been thinking a lot about my future.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.120
And...well, actually

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.279
l was wondering if you might give me a reading.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.279
l'm sorry. l've giving up phrenology.

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.879
Oh, Emily, l'm...

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.479
l'm so sorry.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.759
Don't be.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:04.520
Charlotte's trial was a revelation for me as well.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.938
l realized... l haven't been living my life at all.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.720
l've been living my father's idea what my life should be

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.639
Phrenology, Chopin.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.439
Even you, Mortimer.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.479
You seem happy.

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.879
l am.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.640
After all, life will always
be to large extent to what we ourselves make it.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:29.679
The inimitable Mr. Smiles.
l shall miss him.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.498
And l shall miss you.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.959
God, you're naughty

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.519
l should never send yourself of it .

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.607
No, no. Not even for Christmas.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:49.399
You just go out and purchase one for yourself.

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.759
God bless you, Mom.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.559
lt is a clever old woman
who can keep up with today's technology.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:56.680
Alright then.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.120
Lovely chatting to you.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.239
Ring me anytime.
Goodbye.

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.840
Any prospects?

01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:09.000
My name is mud.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.479
Open this.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.440
l told you before l don't want your money.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.399
lt's not my money, it's yours.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.799
lt's your share of the royalties

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.799
of my manufacturers.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:30.519
The portable electric massager.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.880
The portable electric massager?

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.959
Yes, l told you l was working on something rather exciting .

01:23:35.959 --> 01:23:38.720
You see, l made a very small motor.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.560
lt seems to go really well, so l shared it to few firms,

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.479
and they simply adored it.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:44.519
And apparently,

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:47.679
They're selling it directly to women for home use.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.519
l really have to admit, l know for it go so high

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:55.479
but, it is rather ingenious that l signifies saying it

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.839
myself.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:02.815
Don't you understand, Mortimer?
You have your fortune now.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.719
You can have anything you want.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.399
Miss Dalrymple.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.999
Dr. Granville.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.039
Hello.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.079
Merry Christmas.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.839
I realize it's a day early but l thought you might need it.

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:16.639
I don't know what to say.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:19.239
Apparently, there is a first time for everything.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.719
Right.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.559
May I?

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.479
That's lovely.

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.239
Oh, that's very kind.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.679
Oh, there's something more.

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.839
Think of it as a getting out of prison present.

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.920
You once said that with two thousand pounds,
you can change the world.

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.240
You're not serious?

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:07.679
Apparently, l'm rich.

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.959
And the buildings are yet for sale.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.039
Well, l'm not too late, am l? You're still interested?

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.599
Yes, of course.
More than ever.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.279
Although l should think by the time l finished,
few thousand pounds not be nearly enough...

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.520
Are you never satisfied, woman?

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.959
might be enough for a clinic.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.759
Clinic?

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.559
Would it pay well?

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:35.719
l'm afraid not.

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.519
Would the cases be interesting?

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.039
Routine, l should think.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.639
Broken bones,

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.119
sick children,

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.879
needy women.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.239
Sounds revolting.

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.109
Perhaps something else.

01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:50.119
Perhaps something there.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.640
l wondered if you might have an opening

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:02.839
for a partner, for an equal?

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:04.999
Mortimer, if you think...

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:05.959
Oh damn it!

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.639
Charlotte Dalrymple,

01:27:09.478 --> 01:27:10.630
l love you.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.900
Will you marry me?

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:24.079
Please don't make me beg. Not in the street.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.319
I need to kiss you first.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.719
Charlotte, l hardly think that in the circumstance...

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.759
- Did you like it?
- Yes, it was rather nice actually.

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:43.706
You so?

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.839
Not bad.
You'll get better.

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.519
Who would've thought?

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.399
Charlotte and Mortimer, together.

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:13.119
Life often brings together strange bedfellows.

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:14.945
Yes, quite...quite.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.679
Well, all's well that ends well.

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.159
Fresh air and perambulation.

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.319
The key to mental equity and long life.

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.279
lf you say so, Doctor.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.759
Oh, look. Ducks.

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.240
You alright down there, Colonel?

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.080
Patience, Eugenia. Patience.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:25.239
The empire was not built in a day.

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.817
That's very casual of you.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.599
What are you wearing?

01:29:42.305 --> 01:29:48.462
