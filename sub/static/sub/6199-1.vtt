08:59.664 --> 09:01.206
In Bram Stoker's Dracula,

about female power,

09:04.585 --> 09:07.712

Now, with Carmilla,

16:37.788 --> 16:39.414
we are looking at
one of the originators

16:39.415 --> 16:40.957
of the Gothic tale,

16:40.958 --> 16:43.376
20 years before Bram Stoker
wrote Dracula,

16:43.377 --> 16:45.294
and I think it's fair to say,

16:45.295 --> 16:46.963
it influenced him greatly.

16:46.964 --> 16:49.632
All right, let's talk about
the character of Carmilla.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.926
A mysterious stranger
comes from the West

16:51.927 --> 16:54.595
and begins to take over
the narrator, Laura.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.389
- "Sometimes
with gloating eyes,

16:56.390 --> 16:57.640
"she drew me to her,

16:57.641 --> 16:58.975
"and her hot lips

16:58.976 --> 17:00.810
"traveled along
my cheeks in kisses,

17:00.811 --> 17:04.605
"and she would whisper,
almost in sobs,

17:04.606 --> 17:07.608
"'You are mine.
You shall be mine.

17:07.608 --> 17:09.609
You and I are one forever.'"

I can smell it from here.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.032
- What are you reading?
- CarmiIIa.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.451
It's for Mr. Davies' class.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.452
- What's it about?

17:19.454 --> 17:21.539
- Hey.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.791
- You know,
it's Gothic fiction.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.127
- You're burning red.

17:26.127 --> 17:28.296
How do you stand such hot water
on your skin?

17:28.297 --> 17:30.339
- We always take hot baths
before bedtime.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.050
It's relaxing.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.595
- So I've brought us
a list of verbs to conjugate.

17:35.596 --> 17:39.432
Let's start with baden,
to bathe.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.475
- Baden.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.476
- Mm-hmm.

17:41.477 --> 17:45.480
Beginnen.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.739
- Beginnen.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.658
I'll show you how far I got.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.914
- "The vampire is prone
to be fascinated

18:02.915 --> 18:05.333
"by particular persons.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.544
"With an engrossing vehemence
resembling the passion of love,

18:08.545 --> 18:13.966
"it will never desist until
it has satiated its passion

18:13.967 --> 18:17.678
and drained the very life
of its coveted victim."

18:29.024 --> 18:30.066
- Hello.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.943
- Do you have a minute?
- Of course.

18:34.822 --> 18:35.863
Here you go.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.032
Please.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.411
- Um, it's about Carmilla.
- Okay.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.205
- If she's in love with Laura,

18:44.206 --> 18:45.915
then why does she want
to destroy her?

18:45.916 --> 18:47.583
- Well, I don't know
that she wants to destroy her.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.001
She wants to control her.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.295
The vampire's
a very lonely figure.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.464
Carmilla wants a companion
in her existence.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.967
She wants someone
to be all hers, forever.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.637
- But why does Laura want
to be friends with someone

18:59.638 --> 19:01.931
who's so obviously evil?

19:01.932 --> 19:04.058
- I suppose she's been
hypnotized in some way.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.727
Remember, the vampire needs
the consent of the victim.

19:06.728 --> 19:09.397
- The vampire needs
the victim's consent?

19:09.398 --> 19:11.149
- Yes-
well, in a way.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.859
Remember, in Dracula,
he can only enter

19:12.860 --> 19:14.694
if the victim
leaves the window open.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.321
- It's Lucy's fault
for being such a weak person.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.657
- Lucy?
- No, I mean Laura.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.033
It's Laura's fault.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.286
- Mm, in a way.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.328
- Thank you.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.413
It's been a big help.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.837
Hey, Lu, do you have
the shoe polish?

19:32.838 --> 19:34.088
Did you get new shoes?

19:34.089 --> 19:36.924
I don't think those are allowed,
are they?

19:36.925 --> 19:38.259
- These are Ernessa's.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.969
- And why are you cleaning them?

19:39.970 --> 19:41.721
- She doesn't know how.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.514
She's never had to polish
her own shoes.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.808
- It's really not that hard.

19:45.809 --> 19:48.019
I'm sure she could do it
if she tried.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.032
She never eats.
Have you noticed?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.200
- What?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.160
- Ernessa, she never eats
anything, ever.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.453
- Maybe she's anorexic.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.163
- Remember Annie Patterson
last year?

20:07.164 --> 20:09.665
Her face looked like a skull,
and she still wouldn't eat.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.834
- I just don't think
that'll ever be my problem.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.294
- When you lose
that much weight,

20:13.295 --> 20:14.879
your body can't even
keep itself warm,

20:14.880 --> 20:16.672
and you begin to grow fuzz
all over your arms.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.841
You can see it when they stand
against the light.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.843
They call it "the glow."
Does Ernessa glow?

20:20.844 --> 20:23.137
- No, and I don't think
she's starving herself.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.306
Look at her.
She has a perfect body.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.724
But if you think
she has anorexia,

20:26.725 --> 20:28.768
you could just go up to her
and feel her arms.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.187
- This is really fucking stupid.

20:33.857 --> 20:36.150
- Sorry.
- Whoa.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.443
- She's too sensitive.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.945
- What a way to start a morning.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.788
Do you think Ernessa's
hooking up with someone

20:48.789 --> 20:49.872
at Langley College?

20:49.873 --> 20:51.040
- A boy?
No way.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.500
- She's slipping out at night.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.542
- What do you mean?

20:53.543 --> 20:55.002
- I heard her door open
last night.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.170
And she didn't come back in,

20:56.171 --> 20:58.005
at least not until after
I fell asleep.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.006
- Really?

20:59.007 --> 21:00.091
- It's happened before too.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.259
- Weirdo.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.677
Maybe she goes out to score.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.428
- In the middle of the night,
go into town?

21:04.429 --> 21:05.805
- Let's follow her.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.890
See where she goes,
what she gets up to.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.935
- Can you see anything?

21:10.936 --> 21:12.311
- I don't know.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.354
- It's fucking freezing.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.190
What does Ernessa do out here?

21:16.191 --> 21:17.817
- She watches us sleep.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.413
Hey, you know when you see
the school from here,

21:30.414 --> 21:32.164
you can totally imagine
what it looked like

21:32.165 --> 21:33.624
back when it was a hotel.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.335
Guests drinking tea
on the lawn.

21:36.336 --> 21:37.670
- When I see the school
from here,

21:37.671 --> 21:39.171
I think about how easy
it would be

21:39.172 --> 21:42.008
to just walk out.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.677
- Well, I don't see Ernessa,
and it's cold.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.012
Come on, let's go,

21:46.013 --> 21:49.223
before the caretaker
creeps on us.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.558
- Dora, wait up.

22:00.277 --> 22:04.113
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.413
- Deanndra,
comment for short skirt.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.207
Charlotte, third comment
for messy hair.

22:15.208 --> 22:19.253
Detention.

22:19.254 --> 22:22.006
Rebecca,
comment for dirty shoes.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.800
And Mrs. Rood needs to see you
in her study now.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.053
- How can she give
wardrobe advice?

22:27.054 --> 22:28.387
It's like we're in,
like, duty.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.360
- When I was a little girl,

22:42.361 --> 22:43.736
the farmers said that
a nosebleed

22:43.737 --> 22:46.530
was a sign of good luck.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.618
You really shouldn't be sad

22:50.619 --> 22:52.953
about these
cheap, sentimental things.

22:52.954 --> 22:55.831
I feel like sweeping them all
into a pile on the floor.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.041
- That's cruel.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.667
Mrs. Rood lost her husband.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.795
She needs these things
to go on living.

23:00.796 --> 23:05.049
- I don't need things
to remember my father.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.509
- Neither do l.

23:33.620 --> 23:37.289
Before Ernessa came here,
I was getting better.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.707
I was happy.

23:41.169 --> 23:46.006
Now all the darkness
has come flooding back.

23:46.007 --> 23:50.719
It's like she's invading
my mind.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.264
Even when I'm alone,
I can't escape her.

23:57.352 --> 24:01.605
There's this disgusting smell
that comes from her room:

24:01.606 --> 24:04.442
sickly sweet but rotten.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.194
Why doesn't anyone else
notice it?

24:11.825 --> 24:12.992
Lucy?

24:16.204 --> 24:18.038
I haven't seen you all day.
Where have you been?

24:18.039 --> 24:21.500
- I was busy.

24:21.501 --> 24:22.960
Why did you complain
to Mrs. Rood

24:22.961 --> 24:24.211
about Ernessa's room?

24:24.212 --> 24:25.713
- Lucy, it's right across
the hall from me,

24:25.714 --> 24:27.047
and it smells really bad.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.175
- I thought you would be more
sensitive, considering.

24:29.176 --> 24:30.384
- Considering what?

24:30.385 --> 24:32.720
- Her dad killed himself.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.516
- I didn't know.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.727
- I thought you, of all people,
would understand.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.450
- November 9th.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.619
His last day on Earth.

25:01.124 --> 25:02.458
Lucy didn't remember.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.959
She never said anything.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.129
We spent it together
last year.

25:12.928 --> 25:16.555
- What's your favorite memory
of your father?

25:16.556 --> 25:17.890
Let's think about that.

25:19.935 --> 25:24.271
- If I had to pick one moment,

25:24.272 --> 25:27.608
it would be the night we saw
the Luna moth.

25:32.781 --> 25:33.948
- Look.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.950
There.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.201
You see it?

25:38.787 --> 25:41.372
I've never seen a moth
like that before.

25:52.133 --> 25:55.177
- The Luna moth was the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.934
Why weren't those things
enough for him?

26:05.146 --> 26:09.817
"A person may become a vampyre
if he dies unseen."

26:09.818 --> 26:13.696
My father
wanted to die unseen,

26:13.697 --> 26:16.824
like an animal who wants
to curl up and die alone.

26:21.496 --> 26:23.497
- Don't feel bad
about your father.

26:23.498 --> 26:27.668
Some of the greatest artists
went mad or committed suicide.

26:27.669 --> 26:33.007
Some people find great joy
in the prospect of death.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.925
Just thinking about it
can be a comfort,

26:34.926 --> 26:40.097
like lying in your bed
and pulling up the covers.

26:40.098 --> 26:45.060
The moment of death
is ecstatic.

26:45.061 --> 26:48.939
It's the most joyful sensation.

26:48.940 --> 26:52.109
You're being born into
a new existence.

27:18.553 --> 27:21.597
- Is my father's illness
in my blood too?

27:25.435 --> 27:28.729
I wonder when he did it.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.398
How much did it hurt?

27:32.859 --> 27:36.070
And did it really
take the pain away?

28:06.101 --> 28:08.102
- Party in my room tonight,
FYI.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.645
- Okay.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.532
- Hello, she.
What'd you bring me today?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.492
- Hey, so tell me,
are you nervous?

28:23.493 --> 28:25.244
- Of doing it?
- Yeah.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.246
- Well, Kiki said
it wouldn't hurt that much.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.664
- I know.
It's just the whole thing.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.082
I mean,
what if it feels weird?

28:30.083 --> 28:33.419
Or what if you change your mind
right in the middle of it?

28:33.420 --> 28:34.753
- I don't know.

28:34.754 --> 28:37.214
Part of me just wants
to get it over with, you know?

28:37.215 --> 28:38.257
- Don't do that.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.508
- We have to.
It hides the smell.

28:39.509 --> 28:40.926
- I mean it.
I'll have to leave.

28:40.927 --> 28:43.429
It'll suffocate me.
It's so sweet.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.472
- All right.
You guys move to the window.

28:45.473 --> 28:47.850
We'll just
freeze our butts off.

28:50.687 --> 28:52.312
- Right.

28:54.441 --> 28:55.983
- How does it feel?

28:55.984 --> 28:58.152
- It's fine.
I don't even feel anything.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.863
- Are you serious, Becca?

29:00.864 --> 29:03.073
- Are you okay?

29:03.074 --> 29:06.076
Just lie down, okay?

29:06.077 --> 29:08.078
- Don't cry about it.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.677
- Speaking of yesterday,
of life.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.678
Eccentric.

29:24.679 --> 29:27.723
- What's going on?

29:39.944 --> 29:41.445
- I need to tell you.

29:41.446 --> 29:44.740
Listen to me.

29:44.741 --> 29:47.201
I need to tell you,

29:47.202 --> 29:50.204
tell you what it's like.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.455
When I first came here,

29:51.456 --> 29:54.041
we took the boat over.

29:54.042 --> 29:57.252
I kept looking
at the gray waves,

29:57.253 --> 30:01.381
and I kept saying to myself,
"Jump, jump."

30:01.382 --> 30:06.345
But it was too cold.

30:06.346 --> 30:09.807
The Brangwyn Hotel.

30:09.808 --> 30:13.685
I arrived with the same secret
that you did:

30:13.686 --> 30:16.396
a father's suicide.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.235
My mother brought me here
because she wanted to put

30:21.236 --> 30:24.279
an ocean between his death
and me.

30:24.280 --> 30:28.075
But to me,
an ocean was nothing.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.576
Everywhere I went,

30:29.577 --> 30:34.665
I heard my father's voice
calling to me.

- Yes!

Ernessa's room.

Okay.

34:28.524 --> 34:30.358

34:30.359 --> 34:31.485
- That's impossible.

34:31.485 --> 34:32.819

42:26.710 --> 42:28.795
It's a first edition
of your father's book.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.755
You know, I have to tell you,
I so admire

42:30.756 --> 42:33.174
the way your father kept writing
and working all those years.

42:33.175 --> 42:34.968
- The bank?

42:34.969 --> 42:36.302
- Yes, the bank.

42:36.303 --> 42:38.346
- I think he kind of liked
having a real job.

42:38.347 --> 42:39.931
- You know,
I try to write at night,

42:39.932 --> 42:45.103
but there's marking papers,
and there's preparation.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.980
I don't know.

42:46.981 --> 42:49.816
Sometimes I just feel my life
slipping away.

42:51.485 --> 42:53.987
- You know, with my dad,

42:53.988 --> 42:55.572
it feels like
all the bad stuff happened

42:55.573 --> 42:57.740
when he was able to stay home
all day and write.

42:57.741 --> 43:00.410
- I will take that
as my inspiration.

43:00.411 --> 43:03.329
He really is my hero,
you know.

43:03.330 --> 43:05.415
- Mr. Davies?
- Yes?

43:05.416 --> 43:06.749
- I need your supply list.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.418
- Of course, uh-
- Thank you.

43:08.419 --> 43:11.087
- I was just showing Rebecca
here this-this book.

43:11.088 --> 43:12.297
It's her father's.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.173
very rare.

43:14.174 --> 43:15.758
- Bye.

43:23.100 --> 43:26.060
- Hey, are you joining
basketball?

43:26.061 --> 43:27.854
- I'm not going to do sports
this term.

43:27.855 --> 43:28.938
It's too tiring.

43:28.939 --> 43:29.981
- Why are you so tired?

43:29.982 --> 43:31.274
You know,
you should eat more.

43:31.275 --> 43:33.276
- I do eat.
I eat all the time.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.861
- I don't see you
at breakfast anymore.

43:34.862 --> 43:36.362
- I'm not hungry
in the morning.

43:36.363 --> 43:38.906
- You don't seem very hungry
at dinner either.

43:38.907 --> 43:42.243
- It's okay, Mom.
I'm fine.

43:42.244 --> 43:45.121
- Okay, okay.
I'm sorry.

43:45.122 --> 43:46.956
I'll back off.

43:55.049 --> 43:56.716
Lucy?

43:58.761 --> 44:00.428
Where have you been?

44:00.429 --> 44:01.721
- I couldn't get up
this morning.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.014
I slept right through
the bell.

44:03.015 --> 44:05.642
- I see that Caroline Wallis
and Lucy Blake

44:05.643 --> 44:08.478
were late for assembly.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.314
You will report for detention
after classes.

44:11.315 --> 44:14.275
Ernessa Bloch
has missed gymnastics

44:14.276 --> 44:16.736
for the fourth week
in a row.

44:16.737 --> 44:20.156
She will report to Miss Bobbie
to make up these classes.

44:20.157 --> 44:21.616
- Miss Bobbie
makes Ernessa swim laps

44:21.617 --> 44:23.993
every day after school.

44:23.994 --> 44:25.036
It's so unfair.

44:25.037 --> 44:27.413
It's like torture for her.

44:30.751 --> 44:33.252
- Now, into the pool.
Into the water.

44:33.253 --> 44:35.421
We don't have all afternoon.

44:40.427 --> 44:41.427
- Head up.
Breathe.

44:41.428 --> 44:42.470
Head down.

44:42.471 --> 44:44.430
Bend your elbows.

44:44.431 --> 44:45.431
Point your toes.

44:45.432 --> 44:46.683
Breathe.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.247
- Becca.

45:09.248 --> 45:12.625
I'm meeting Chris tonight
in the upper field to, uh...

45:12.626 --> 45:14.794
well, you know.

45:14.795 --> 45:15.878
- Really?

45:15.879 --> 45:17.338
- Yeah.

45:17.339 --> 45:19.757
I want you and Kiki
to keep guard.

45:19.758 --> 45:21.426
Will you do it?

45:21.427 --> 45:23.136
- Yeah, of course,
if you want us to.

45:23.137 --> 45:24.887
- Thank you.

45:35.566 --> 45:38.067
- You know, if it rains tonight,
we're leaving.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.327
- Can you see
their hovering spirits

46:29.328 --> 46:31.662
entwined through eternity?

46:31.663 --> 46:33.372
Just like a poem.

46:59.399 --> 47:01.567
- Hey, Rebecca.

47:06.949 --> 47:09.075
- So how was it?

47:09.076 --> 47:11.244
- It was kind of nothing.

47:11.245 --> 47:14.789
I feel exactly the same way
I did before.

47:14.790 --> 47:17.041
And I'm sure
I'm not in love with him.

47:17.042 --> 47:19.210
- Well, did you
at least enjoy it?

47:19.211 --> 47:20.670
- Not really.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.255
Maybe I will
after I get used to it.

47:22.256 --> 47:24.048
- Okay.

47:24.049 --> 47:26.133
- I'm just glad
it's over with.

47:26.134 --> 47:28.970
I'm glad it was the first time
for both of us.

47:30.264 --> 47:31.806
- What is that?

47:35.853 --> 47:38.521
- Oh, my God.

47:38.522 --> 47:42.441
- I regret to say
that a terrible accident

47:42.442 --> 47:45.945
has befallen one of our
teachers, Miss Bobbie.

47:45.946 --> 47:48.406
She died some time
last night.

47:48.407 --> 47:51.450
Please, girls, be quiet.

47:51.451 --> 47:53.035
Assembly is not yet over.

47:53.036 --> 47:56.747
Let us turn to hymn 51.

48:01.587 --> 48:06.757
♪ O, God,
our help in ages past ♪

48:06.758 --> 48:11.053
♪ Our hope for years to come ♪

48:11.054 --> 48:15.892
♪ Our shelter
from the stormy blast ♪

48:15.893 --> 48:19.604
♪ And our eternal home ♪

48:19.605 --> 48:21.314
- Rebecca.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.732
My mom came in early.

48:22.733 --> 48:26.068
She won't let me come back
after spring break.

48:26.069 --> 48:28.279
I shouldn't have said anything
about Miss Bobbie,

48:28.280 --> 48:31.532
but I was so upset,
and I don't want to leave you.

48:34.077 --> 48:35.912
- All my friends are gone.

49:04.566 --> 49:08.444
Ernessa spends all her time
in Lucy's room.

49:08.445 --> 49:12.949
They always
keep the door shut.

49:12.950 --> 49:16.369
Lucy's just a few feet away,

49:16.370 --> 49:20.790
but she might as well be
on the other side of the world.

49:25.921 --> 49:27.129
- You look like death.

49:27.130 --> 49:28.172
- It's cramps.

49:28.173 --> 49:30.091
I feel like I'm hemorrhaging.

49:30.092 --> 49:32.343
- I haven't had my period
in months.

49:33.845 --> 49:35.513
No, thanks.

49:35.514 --> 49:37.056
- How can you resist this?

49:37.057 --> 49:38.599
- Lucy, it's your favorite.

49:47.067 --> 49:49.068
- I'm going back to my room.

49:50.946 --> 49:53.364
- Okay, I have to talk to you
about Ernessa.

49:53.365 --> 49:55.825
- I'm not gonna indulge you
in your ridiculous obsession.

49:55.826 --> 49:58.285
I'm sorry to say this,
but you're just jealous.

49:58.286 --> 49:59.954
- How can she survive
without eating?

49:59.955 --> 50:02.373
- I don't want to talk about
this anymore.

51:23.997 --> 51:25.831
- Wake up.
Wake up!

51:25.832 --> 51:27.666
Didn't you hear the sirens?

51:27.667 --> 51:29.543
- The what?

51:29.544 --> 51:31.587
- The ambulance.
They took Lucy.

51:31.588 --> 51:32.797
- What?

51:46.269 --> 51:47.770
I'll come back later.

51:56.905 --> 52:02.701
Something terrible
is happening to Lucy.

52:02.702 --> 52:04.870
I'm glad she's in hospital.

52:04.871 --> 52:07.748
At least she's away
from Ernessa.

52:14.256 --> 52:15.548
Hi.

52:17.092 --> 52:20.219
I brought you some chocolates
and a book.

52:20.220 --> 52:21.846
- Thank you.

52:29.479 --> 52:30.646
- What's this?

52:30.647 --> 52:34.233
- Ernessa was just here.

52:34.234 --> 52:36.443
She brought that for me.

52:36.444 --> 52:37.987
I'm too tired to read.

52:37.988 --> 52:39.572
The book is so heavy.

52:39.573 --> 52:41.615
- Are you feeling any better?

52:41.616 --> 52:44.493
- It's not bad
feeling so weak.

52:44.494 --> 52:47.788
I just lie here
and think about breathing.

52:47.789 --> 52:49.081
- What happened to your flowers?

52:49.082 --> 52:51.584
They're all faded.

52:53.795 --> 52:56.338
- I guess they're starting
to die.

52:56.339 --> 52:58.757
- I just brought them.

53:07.100 --> 53:15.107
♪ ♪

53:45.472 --> 53:47.806
What's Ernessa doing
in the basement?

53:49.392 --> 53:51.227
We're not allowed down there.

53:55.232 --> 53:59.068
There's that same
horrible smell,

53:59.069 --> 54:01.487
just like the one
from her room.

54:11.039 --> 54:12.164
- Oh!

54:14.417 --> 54:15.834
- Here, let me help you.

54:15.835 --> 54:17.670
- Thank you.

54:17.671 --> 54:19.004
Stupid of me.

54:25.553 --> 54:26.804
You saved me.

54:26.805 --> 54:30.015
- Can I tell you something
in confidence?

54:30.016 --> 54:31.058
- Uh, sure.

54:31.059 --> 54:35.187
- It's my friend,
Lucy Blake.

54:35.188 --> 54:37.564
She hasn't been eating,
and now she's in the hospital.

54:37.565 --> 54:38.732
- Why don't we talk
in the car?

54:38.733 --> 54:39.900
- Yeah.

54:43.113 --> 54:47.700
There's this other girl,
Ernessa Bloch.

54:47.701 --> 54:49.702
She's just a bad influence
on Lucy.

54:49.703 --> 54:52.037
- What do you mean,
bad influence?

54:52.038 --> 54:55.541
- She's controlling her,
and Lucy just accepts it.

54:55.542 --> 54:57.668
- You think she's
enabling Ernessa?

54:57.669 --> 54:59.169
- Lucy adores her,

54:59.170 --> 55:01.714
but Ernessa doesn't have
her best interests at heart.

55:01.715 --> 55:04.383
I mean, Lucy's just getting
sicker and weaker and thinner,

55:04.384 --> 55:06.343
and Ernessa acts like
this is all good.

55:06.344 --> 55:08.929
- You're worried that she's
encouraging her eating disorder.

55:08.930 --> 55:10.764
- Well, it's more than that.
She's dangerous.

55:10.765 --> 55:13.267
She has some power over Lucy.

55:16.104 --> 55:18.314
- You know, cooped up here,
you girls get so close.

55:18.315 --> 55:21.317
All that emotion
can turn toxic.

55:21.318 --> 55:23.193
I mean,
it's obvious Lucy needs help,

55:23.194 --> 55:26.071
but maybe you need to step away
for a little while.

55:26.072 --> 55:28.532
Put all this emotion
into your writing.

55:28.533 --> 55:30.659
Rebecca.

55:30.660 --> 55:33.912
You're a very intelligent girl.

55:33.913 --> 55:36.540
You're one of the brightest
I've ever taught.

55:36.541 --> 55:38.417
You'll figure this out.

55:38.418 --> 55:39.501
Things get worse,

55:39.502 --> 55:40.961
don't be afraid
to come talk to me.

55:40.962 --> 55:42.212
- Thanks.

55:42.213 --> 55:43.380
- Okay.

55:55.602 --> 55:57.353
- Is everything okay with you?

55:57.354 --> 55:58.354
- Not really.

55:58.355 --> 56:00.105
- You seem stressed.

56:00.106 --> 56:02.441
- I'm so worried about Lucy.

56:02.442 --> 56:03.609
It's been ten days,

56:03.610 --> 56:04.818
and they still
won't let me see her.

56:04.819 --> 56:05.819
- Oh, she's much better.

56:05.820 --> 56:07.446
- How do you know?

56:07.447 --> 56:08.489
- I don't know.

56:08.490 --> 56:09.615
- Come on.

56:09.616 --> 56:11.450
- Okay, Ernessa told me.

56:11.451 --> 56:12.493
She visited Lucy.

56:12.494 --> 56:13.994
- When?

56:13.995 --> 56:15.204
- Um, several times last week.

56:15.205 --> 56:16.872
- They let her see Lucy?

56:16.873 --> 56:18.290
- Well, Mrs. Rood
gave her permission,

56:18.291 --> 56:21.043
because she's Lucy's
very special friend.

56:23.546 --> 56:25.881
- You let Ernessa see her?

56:25.882 --> 56:27.674
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

56:27.675 --> 56:29.301
- You told me no visitors.

56:29.302 --> 56:31.136
Why would you let Ernessa
see her?

56:31.137 --> 56:34.098
- Lucy asked to see her.

56:34.099 --> 56:35.849
Now Ernessa can't visit her
either.

56:35.850 --> 56:37.267
- Well, she's my best friend.

56:37.268 --> 56:38.352
It's not fair.

56:38.353 --> 56:41.730
- Lucy has taken a turn
for the worse.

56:41.731 --> 56:44.483
The doctors don't think
she'll last the next few days.

56:44.484 --> 56:45.734
She's so weak.

56:45.735 --> 56:48.028
- No, l-

56:48.029 --> 56:49.655
I have to see her.

56:49.656 --> 56:51.698
I have to say good-bye.
I have to.

56:51.699 --> 56:53.617
- It's out of the question.

56:53.618 --> 56:56.328
Only family members
are allowed to visit.

56:57.497 --> 56:58.580
Oh!

56:58.581 --> 57:01.333
You disrespectful child!

57:06.423 --> 57:09.508
- You, me, Lucy?

57:09.509 --> 57:13.554
It would be better if we never
saw each other again.

57:13.555 --> 57:18.809
I'll give her up
if you just keep away from her.

57:18.810 --> 57:20.978
- Have you ever considered
how much we look alike?

57:47.380 --> 57:48.881
- Miss Johnson,
the nurse...

57:48.882 --> 57:50.174
- Lucy.

57:50.175 --> 57:52.217
- She would bring me
all this green Jell-O.

57:53.470 --> 57:55.053
- Lucy?

57:55.054 --> 57:56.054
- Look, she's back.

57:56.055 --> 57:57.306
And she's so much better.

57:57.307 --> 57:59.308
- Doctors think I'm a miracle.

58:11.738 --> 58:13.238
- Can I talk to you
about something?

58:13.239 --> 58:14.573
- Of course.

58:19.037 --> 58:21.705
- Look, I know what happened
with Dora and Miss Bobbie

58:21.706 --> 58:23.916
made everybody pretty crazy.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.792
- It'll calm down.

58:25.793 --> 58:27.711
Eventually, the school
will get back to normal.

58:27.712 --> 58:29.254
- No, it won't,

58:29.255 --> 58:30.756
because the person
who's doing this

58:30.757 --> 58:32.132
hasn't finished yet.

58:32.133 --> 58:33.884
She still has one more victim.

58:33.885 --> 58:34.968
It's the one she came for.

58:34.969 --> 58:36.470
The others,
they just got in her way.

58:36.471 --> 58:37.679
- I'm-I'm sorry?

Ernessa Bloch?

58:39.849 --> 58:42.309
- The next victim is who?

58:42.310 --> 58:43.435
- Lucy Blake.

58:50.109 --> 58:51.443
- Why are you saying this?

58:51.444 --> 58:52.945
- Because this time,

58:52.946 --> 58:54.613
Lucy won't make it
to the hospital.

58:54.614 --> 58:55.948
- Rebecca, you know
what you're saying

58:55.949 --> 58:57.282
can't possibly be true.

58:57.283 --> 59:00.744
- Lucy got better when
the doctors banned all visitors.

59:00.745 --> 59:03.121
She got better because Ernessa
couldn't get to her.

59:03.122 --> 59:04.915
Ernessa won't let that
happen again.

59:04.916 --> 59:08.460
- Listen, Rebecca.

59:08.461 --> 59:10.671
I understand.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.506
This has been a difficult year
for you.

59:12.507 --> 59:13.674
You're still coming to terms

59:13.675 --> 59:15.133
with what happened
to your father,

59:15.134 --> 59:17.469
but you can't blame it all
on Ernessa.

59:17.470 --> 59:18.929
- It is Ernessa.

59:18.930 --> 59:20.180
Why can't anyone else
see that?

59:20.181 --> 59:21.932
- Rebecca.

59:24.852 --> 59:27.563
You're too young for all these
morbid thoughts.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.106
- Lucy?

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:14.735
I know you're getting
sick again.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:16.695
I'm worried.
I need to call your mom.

01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:21.700
- I'm not sick.

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:24.036
Really, I'm not sick.

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:25.412
It's something else.

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:28.290
- Don't you want your mom
to come get you?

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:29.708
- No, you can't call her.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:32.127
She'd come right away,
in the middle of the night.

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:34.212
- Lucy, I just don't understand
why you won't let me help.

01:00:34.213 --> 01:00:35.547
- That's because
you just want to believe

01:00:35.548 --> 01:00:38.383
that I'm still the old Lucy.

01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:40.594
It's sad.

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:43.597
You don't care about the new me,
the real Lucy.

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:45.140
You don't even want
to know her.

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.559
- This is all Ernessa's fault.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.061
She's turned you against me.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:50.312
That's why you're saying this.

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:51.897
- Why do you want to blame her
for everything?

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:53.940
- Because she is to blame
for everything.

01:00:53.941 --> 01:00:55.025
- No, no.

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:56.234
- If she hadn't come here
this year,

01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:57.778
we would have had
a great year.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:00.489
Don't you see she's ruined
everything for me?

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.698
God, I hate her so much.

01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:02.991
I'd kill her
if I had the chance.

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:04.743

It's sick.
