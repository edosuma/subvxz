Jimmy Flaherty:
You're gonna meet my money manager.

00:08.808 --> 00:11.948
- Why you call him a money manager?
- Because he's offended by greedy Jew.

00:11.978 --> 00:13.616
And rightly so.

00:13.646 --> 00:16.855
I represent Cam Calloway,
and he may be a pro basketball player,

00:16.883 --> 00:18.954
but we want him to be more
than just a basketball player.

00:18.985 --> 00:20.896
We want his money to get off.

00:20.920 --> 00:24.458
There's four people who forced me
to believe that I and they were

00:24.491 --> 00:27.904
worthy of a big time dream,
like a good thing.

00:27.927 --> 00:30.908
Those four people that
believed in me are my family.

00:30.930 --> 00:33.410
My cousin, yo,
you my best friend, man.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.003
All I got is because of you.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.515
You got beat up by your sister,
and then you lied about it.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.744
Jeez, Gerry, I would've lied, too.
She can fucking punch.

00:39.773 --> 00:40.843
Can you drop me off at work?

00:40.874 --> 00:43.252
I gotta do highway trash pickup
for my community service.

00:43.276 --> 00:44.482
That's mobile jail.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.252
- You need a ride to jail?
- Yes.

00:46.279 --> 00:49.226
Attorney: I'd insist on therapy
and community service for Mary Charles

00:49.249 --> 00:51.456
since she's ineligible
for a diversion program.

Sister lrmalita's Children's Home
has rules for adults

01:40.533 --> 01:43.173
who partake in
the Big Siblings Saint Program.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.376
First rule--
care about being here.

01:45.405 --> 01:47.646
This is my number one priority.

01:47.674 --> 01:51.520
Second rule-- If you're gonna lie
to my face, at least sell it.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.718
- I really do care.
- Because a judge told you to.

01:56.749 --> 01:58.592
I'd prefer to find volunteers

01:58.618 --> 02:02.122
who are compelled by kindness,
not fear of jail time.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.965
I planned a ton of activities
for me and my new little sibling.

02:04.991 --> 02:07.835
Yes, people like you've been
coming here for years

02:07.861 --> 02:11.604
inspired by the notion that they're
going to make someone's life better.

02:11.631 --> 02:15.670
But then they bail and retreat
to trash detail on a highway off-ramp.

02:15.702 --> 02:18.046
- Know why?
- Because they love Mother Earth?

02:18.071 --> 02:21.052
Off-ramps don't talk back.
Off-ramps don't have feelings.

02:21.074 --> 02:24.886
Off-ramps weren't inappropriately
touched by their drug-addled parents.

02:24.911 --> 02:29.121
These kids don't need stuff to do,
they need kindness and attention.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.891
Brittany, can you come in here?

02:36.623 --> 02:40.571
Nice to meet you, Brittany.
lam Mary Charles, your new big sibling.

02:40.593 --> 02:43.665
- Hi.
- (softly) Hi.

02:43.696 --> 02:47.109
Congratulations.
You are glowing.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.636
Thanks.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.706
(music playing)

03:03.516 --> 03:05.291
- Oh.
- Oh, it's okay, no problem.

03:05.318 --> 03:07.127
- Hey, uh, Reggie Vaughn?
- Hey. Yes.

03:07.153 --> 03:10.327
Allow me to introduce myself,
DeShauwn May.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.892
How you doing, DeShauwn?
Nice to meet you.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.461
I manage athletes just like you.

03:13.493 --> 03:16.337
I've been watching
your moves real close.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.865
- And you killing it, bro.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

03:18.898 --> 03:20.969
Listen, you haven't seen
a rich, balding guy?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.411
Kinda looks like a black Grinch?

03:22.435 --> 03:26.042
See, the only man that DeShauwn sees
is his client, Jupiter Blackmon,

03:26.072 --> 03:27.517
and that's with an O,
not an A.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.020
Though, I told Under Armour last week,

03:30.043 --> 03:35.117
if they help me with this marketing
thing, he could be "Black-man" all day.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.424
- You know what I'm saying?
- Run with that.

03:37.450 --> 03:41.762
Look, Jupiter is gonna be a top-20 pick
in the National Football League.

03:41.788 --> 03:44.997
And the way you and Cam conduct
y'all business, y'all our inspiration.

03:45.024 --> 03:46.833
We ghetto-born, too.

03:46.859 --> 03:49.499
And what Cam said about you
at the press conference...

03:50.730 --> 03:53.108
I cried.
Thug tears, though.

03:53.132 --> 03:55.373
Not that weepy stuff,
you know what I'm saying?

03:55.401 --> 03:57.347
- I hear you. I hear you.
- You know what I'm saying.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.316
Nice to meet you, man,
but excuse me, all right?

03:59.339 --> 04:01.478
Wait-- whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, real talk for a second.

04:01.507 --> 04:03.851
Hey, you thriving, so if you got
any dabs of wisdom

04:03.876 --> 04:06.755
- to throw my way, let me know.
- Buy the Vanguard, wear condoms.

04:06.779 --> 04:09.020
Oh, damn, that's two things
I never thought about.

04:09.048 --> 04:11.824
- What? You a goddamn genius, boy.
- Tell me you found him.

04:11.851 --> 04:14.889
- Mall Mogul has left the building.
- You said 100%, Missy.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.528
- You swore to me, I swore to Cam.
- His wife says he got the bubble guts.

04:18.558 --> 04:21.004
Not my fault if the man mixed
crab legs and chili dogs.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.870
- (sighs)
- I love crabs.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.499
'Cause you got to work
to get in them guts.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.237
Just like a classy lady.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.439
- Miss Vaughn, DeShauwn.
- Oh.

04:29.902 --> 04:32.246
- Excuse us.
- (whispers) Who is he?

04:32.272 --> 04:35.253
- (whispers) I'll tell you later.
- (Cam laughing) Come here.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.553
- Yo, Reg. This here's Jupiter.
- Hi, it's a honor.

04:39.579 --> 04:42.423
Cam says you like the biggest shit...
in a good way.

04:42.448 --> 04:46.157
- Yo, we all hitting Onyx posthaste.
- Oh, yeah, it's been a long day.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.166
I need some titties in my face,
you know what I'm saying?

04:49.188 --> 04:51.498
- I'm with my wife.
- She can go.

04:51.524 --> 04:54.869
Look, the strip club is
an equal opportunity establishment.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.636
- Wasn't really my point.
- You know what? You go ahead.

04:57.664 --> 05:00.508
- I'll go home. I'll Uber.
- DeShauwn: Boom, she know.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.605
The titty bar is the golf course
for the modern-day businessman.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.549
- Baby, you don't want to Uber home.
- I do.

05:06.572 --> 05:09.519
- I very much want to Uber.
- Well, and, Cam, you're probably tired.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.078
You want to go home,
get some rest, right?

05:11.110 --> 05:12.953
Hell, no, man.
You done woke up the beast.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.118
Look, we already out anyways, man.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.594
And Jupiter's hilarious.
Yo, Jupe, do Shaq.

05:19.052 --> 05:22.192
Ahem. Hi, I'm Shaq.

05:22.221 --> 05:24.098
- (Cam laughs)
- It's uncanny.

05:24.123 --> 05:26.125
- "Kazaam"!
- (laughing)

05:26.159 --> 05:29.470
- Cam: "Kazaam"!
- You been practicing on that, right?

05:29.495 --> 05:32.135
Jupiter: Yeah, you taught me that.
That was you. That was you.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.940
Cam: Who else do you do?
You got Charles, too?

05:33.966 --> 05:36.003
(music playing)

05:44.077 --> 05:48.457
- So who do you thinks the daddy?
- One of three boys, I think.

05:48.481 --> 05:52.987
Though, it could be God's, Diane says.
That's happened before.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.831
- A long time ago in Bethlehem.
- Right.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.495
I think one of the three boys
is a good guess.

06:00.526 --> 06:04.668
They all live here in the home.
They're nice.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.938
I wasn't taken advantage of
or anything.

06:06.966 --> 06:10.311
One's my age, 12 and a half.
Other two are 12.

06:10.336 --> 06:14.682
- Are you all supervised?
- Not always.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.119
It's not bad or nothing.
I like the feeling.

06:17.143 --> 06:20.818
People say I won't like the feeling of
the baby coming out, but that's okay.

06:20.847 --> 06:24.294
I can do hard things.
I believe in myself, you know?

06:25.918 --> 06:28.159
I do.

06:28.187 --> 06:31.168
Some people want me to give it away,
but I kind of want to keep it.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.170
Not sure.

06:35.895 --> 06:40.105
- I think that's smart.
- You're the first one to say that.

06:43.202 --> 06:45.546
- You like crullers?
- What's that?

06:45.571 --> 06:48.177
- They're double-long donuts.
- Sure.

06:48.207 --> 06:51.416
Well, let's feast. You go find your
three buddies, I got a whole dozen.

06:51.444 --> 06:52.514
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:52.545 --> 06:55.287
They'll love that.
(grunts)

06:55.314 --> 06:57.521
Hey, Jamari, Lucas.

06:57.550 --> 07:01.396

I can't wait to go pro

07:31.451 --> 07:33.362
until we make some real money,
you know what I'm saying?

07:33.386 --> 07:35.730
You can't believe the piddly deals
they've been throwing at Jupiter.

07:35.755 --> 07:38.463
$100 for a barbershop appearance?

07:38.491 --> 07:41.404
What I'ma do with $100?
(scoffs)

07:41.427 --> 07:43.634
- Nothing now.
- (sighs)

07:43.663 --> 07:45.370
Look, see, they all think
they can take advantage

07:45.398 --> 07:48.379
'cause our moves got to be on
the down-low until after the bowl game.

07:48.401 --> 07:53.180
NCAA--
no cash for African-Americans.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.446
(laughs)
You know what I'm saying?

07:54.474 --> 07:57.546
Hey, in five months,
he'll be a multimillionaire.

07:57.577 --> 08:01.457
Whoo, and DeShauwn will be
rolling in 10% of that multi.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.018
Hey, get a lawyer for the long-form.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.963
DeShauwn ain't giving up no 5%
for no boilerplate bullshit.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.297
It's my job to save Jupiter money,
not spend it.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.566
Mm, that's real.
Compliments.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.364
Hey, I'm curious.
How did you and Jupiter hook up?

08:17.396 --> 08:19.103
Started as his mama drug dealer.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.133
See, J needed his own
illicit therapeutics.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.078
Football's about pain management,

08:23.102 --> 08:26.208
which makes DeShauwn indispensable
as his dispenser,

08:26.239 --> 08:28.412
- you know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I know what you're saying.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.921
Pretty sure you shouldn't be
saying it to a total stranger.

08:30.943 --> 08:33.616
Please, our spirits
are kindred as fuck.

08:33.645 --> 08:34.989
- Do you know what "kindred" is?
- Yes.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.961
Okay, then. All right, see, yeah,
I got some extra spending money

08:37.984 --> 08:40.760
'cause of my drug dealing business,
but I'm trying to get out that.

08:40.785 --> 08:43.460
Trying to go legit
like you, baby, yeah.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.833
Hey, quitting selling drugs
is a smart move, DeShauwn.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.428
We shall see.

08:47.460 --> 08:51.374
Look... you mind if I get
heavy with you for a second?

08:51.397 --> 08:54.776
When Cam hit and all the big agency
vultures started circling,

08:54.800 --> 08:57.474
- how'd you keep your boy?
- I did my job.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.642
- That's it?
- That's it.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.379
I feel like I should be
paying you or something

09:01.407 --> 09:03.353
for dropping all these gems, man.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.185
- You want some cocaine?
- You're too kind,

09:05.211 --> 09:07.782
- but I'm good, thank you.
- Okay.

09:07.813 --> 09:10.293
See, you spin the stacks
off the fingertips

09:10.316 --> 09:12.421
for maximum precipitation.

09:12.451 --> 09:15.022
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.695
Oh, the boys? They in the champagne
room getting their dicks sucked,

09:18.724 --> 09:21.227
- if you know what I'm saying.
- Yeah, I know what you're saying

09:21.260 --> 09:23.433
because you just said it,
and it better not be true.

09:23.462 --> 09:26.841
Look, DeShauwn, every phone in here
is one click away from "TMZ."

09:26.866 --> 09:29.210
What?
Ain't nobody worried about no trolls.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.715
I'm worried about it,
and you should be, too.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.774
Look, man, do what you will
with the Black-Man,

09:33.806 --> 09:36.377
but as my colleague,
don't put my client in harm's way.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.288
Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch it
with the flaming arrows, Cochise.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.555
Look, I'm simply driving
the wagon train through the prairie.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.028
Look, it'll be fine, all right?

09:45.051 --> 09:47.292
Ain't no snitching types
up in this piece.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.994
- Look, I get head here weekly.
- There's a line, DeShauwn.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.797
And while I'm happy to respect
what's on yours,

09:51.824 --> 09:53.826
you will respect what's on my side.

09:53.859 --> 09:56.135
- It won't happen again.
- Thank you.

09:58.531 --> 10:02.843
- Man, we have got to do this again.
- See? (laughing)

10:02.868 --> 10:05.405
- Reg.
- Where's Jupiter?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.974
Beats me, man.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.713
- It was pitch-black in there.
- Oh, no, he'll be through.

10:08.741 --> 10:11.347
See, my Jupiter like to get
his ass ate after brain.

10:11.377 --> 10:13.414
And they get the dingleberries
and everything.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.121
- What's a dingleberry?
- It's when hair, shit, and toilet paper

10:17.149 --> 10:19.755
roll up in a little berry
and dangles out the crack of your ass,

10:19.785 --> 10:21.355
- that's a dingleberry.
- You ever had one?

10:21.387 --> 10:24.425
- Yeah. (laughing)
- Treat yourself. Yes!

10:24.457 --> 10:27.336
Yes! Live, brother, live.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.931
Whoo!

10:31.030 --> 10:33.943
♪ Let's fuck up some comma, yeah,
let's fuck up some commas, yeah ♪

10:33.966 --> 10:36.503
I like being a big sibling.

10:36.535 --> 10:39.448
I'm gonna be right by her side
walking her through having her baby.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.008
Well, good for you,
Mary Charles.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.510
You're making lemons out of lemonade
and helping others in the process.

10:44.543 --> 10:46.216
You mean making
lemonade out of lemons.

10:46.245 --> 10:49.158
God damn it, you know what I meant.
You're making good shit out of bad shit.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.183
I agree that what you're doing
is admirable.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.060
But how could this Diane woman,

10:53.085 --> 10:55.122
who's charged with the welfare
of these orphan children,

10:55.154 --> 10:57.100
let this happen under her supervision?

10:57.123 --> 11:00.002
- She probably ran out of condoms.
- She's doing the best she can.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.165
The best she can
got a 12-year-old pregnant.

11:02.194 --> 11:04.299
The least she could have done
was taken her to a clinic.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.708
Or pushed her down the stairs.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.575
With the girl's consent, of course.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.205
Brittany has a right to have her baby.

11:10.236 --> 11:12.273
She also has a right
to not have the baby.

11:12.304 --> 11:14.147
True--
abortion is a child's right

11:14.173 --> 11:15.880
to choose whether or not
she wants to have a child.

11:15.908 --> 11:19.788
- You had me when you were a kid.
- 15, okay? That's ghetto mid-20s.

11:19.812 --> 11:23.624
She's 12. 12 doesn't even end in "teen."
She's still a child.

11:23.649 --> 11:26.960
I don't know, that's kind of tricky.
I mean, if she's able to have a child,

11:26.986 --> 11:29.125
you know, maybe that's
evolution's way of saying,

11:29.155 --> 11:31.066
"Speed shit up.
The world's about to end.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.593
Can't be waiting
till you're 15 anymore."

11:33.626 --> 11:35.105
Who's handling the adoption?

11:35.127 --> 11:37.164
Oh, the poor baby will probably
go to an orphanage,

11:37.196 --> 11:38.971
and that's if they have
a bed available.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.205
Adoption or abortion
are not her only two options.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.645
It should have been part of the debate
once conception occurred.

11:43.669 --> 11:45.876
It's a child, not a debate.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.248
I guess if it were left
up to you two,

11:47.273 --> 11:49.446
I'd be in pieces in
a medical waste bin somewhere

11:49.475 --> 11:51.716
or adopted by white people
who think Jesus loves all.

11:51.744 --> 11:55.317
Jesus does love all. He just doesn't
show it for sure until you're dead.

11:55.347 --> 11:58.988
Only then do you know
and really appreciate it.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.929
Damn, I got to jot that shit down.

12:00.953 --> 12:03.456
You know, me and Julius
are thinking about doing a podcast.

12:03.489 --> 12:07.665
It's called "Things We Think
You Should Think, Too."

12:09.829 --> 12:13.106
Brittany's a special kid, and I agree
that she should keep her baby.

12:13.132 --> 12:15.476
And she should be treated
just like any other mother-to-be.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.981
As her big sibling,
I'm going to throw her a baby shower.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.505
Where? Chuck E. Cheese?

12:19.538 --> 12:21.575
Mm, I already checked them out.

12:21.607 --> 12:23.348
They are booked solid
for the next several weekends.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.356
I'm gonna ask Cam if I can have it here.
Put his money to good use.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.187
(music playing)

12:28.214 --> 12:31.525
Hey, man, you're kind of small
for a basketball player, ain't you?

12:31.550 --> 12:34.326
You ain't got to be tall,
you just got to be good.

12:34.353 --> 12:37.197
- You'll find out on draft day.
- Oh, I'm getting drafted.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.430
- Getting drafted ain't making it.
- Okay.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.699
Look, hey, I propose
a sojourn at the afterhours.

12:41.727 --> 12:43.673
- Cam's got practice.
- At noon.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.835
- Man, it's 1:00 a.m.
- The president runs the country

12:45.865 --> 12:49.039
on five hours of sleep, I can run that
practice offense on half of that, man.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.639
- Where y'all thinking?
- A little no-name spot up the road.

12:51.670 --> 12:53.707
Me and Cam don't go to no-name spots.

12:53.739 --> 12:56.583
Look, embracing the unknown
is what makes life worth living.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.384
- Thank you.
- And plus there's titties.

12:58.410 --> 12:59.889
- Oh, yeah.
- And embracing them is good, too.

12:59.912 --> 13:03.826
Come on, man. Back when we had shit,
we never went to places with names.

13:03.849 --> 13:06.159
Well, now we got shit,
and we keep that shit

13:06.185 --> 13:08.096
by not going to shitholes
that ain't got no names.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.031
- Jupiter's going.
- Look, I'm not Jupiter's manager,

13:10.055 --> 13:12.296
so I can't advise him
against doing stupid-ass shit.

13:12.324 --> 13:15.498
Come on, Reg. It'll be fun, man.
And you know how I feel about titties.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.508
Cam, you just had
four hours of titties.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.066
How many more hours
of titties you need?

13:19.098 --> 13:20.907
Four more afterhours of titties.

13:20.933 --> 13:24.278
(laughs) Look, I have
supplied you with my advice.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.374
You don't need
my permission to flout it.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.942
(Cam sighs)

13:28.974 --> 13:32.285
Fellas, great night, man.
We gonna call it.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.587
- Aw, come on, man.
- And then there was two.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.422
Jupiter: Look, C-dog, we gonna
have to do this again next weekend.

13:36.448 --> 13:39.088
But we got to go twice as big, baby.
Let me give you my number.

13:39.118 --> 13:43.567
Shit, stripper bounced
so hard on my jock, man,

13:43.589 --> 13:45.034
she damn near
cracked my phone in half.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.866
Them bitches is toned.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.997
Here, I'm gonna give you
Reggie's number till I get mine fixed.

13:49.028 --> 13:52.134
- Thanks a lot.
- Well, look, hey, namaste, bitches.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.542
- I'm out... to the car.
- A'ight. Jupiter.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.671
- Here.
- All right, man.

13:55.701 --> 13:57.442
Hey, I'ma see you next weekend,
baby, be good.

13:57.469 --> 13:58.948
You, too, man.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.315
(music playing)

14:05.611 --> 14:07.591
You really think
you're getting in this bed

14:07.613 --> 14:09.388
without washing off
that stripper stink?

14:09.415 --> 14:11.452
Oh, come on, don't throw stones.

14:11.483 --> 14:14.487
Diamond and Candy are just
saving up money for business school.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.592
Yeah, well,
come back and spoon me

14:17.623 --> 14:21.002
when your spoon doesn't smell like
shattered dreams and daddy issues.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.063
- Okay.
- (groans)

14:25.097 --> 14:26.132
(cell phone vibrating)

14:30.135 --> 14:33.309
- This is Reggie.
- Reg, it's Jupiter, man. I need help.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.012
- Where you at, Jupiter?
- I'm not sure.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.486
It's like-- like trees and leaves
and twigs and dirt.

14:37.509 --> 14:40.683
- Like no roads.
- You're in the woods.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.785
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Jupiter, you high?

14:43.816 --> 14:47.025
- As they come.
- That sounds like a DeShauwn problem.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.656
Man, of course
it's a DeShauwn problem, man!

14:48.687 --> 14:50.428
DeShauwn's the reason
shit went sideways at the afterhours

14:50.456 --> 14:52.026
and I'm running through
the damn woods.

14:52.057 --> 14:56.528
(groans) Okay, drop a pin,
text it to me, and I'll pick you up.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.599
(music playing)

15:00.032 --> 15:02.808
(sighs)
I will be back.

15:12.278 --> 15:15.157
Jupiter, what kind of shit
you getting on my wife's leather?

15:15.180 --> 15:18.059
Ah, that's Shit Shit, I think.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.892
It ain't mine, though,
in case you was worried.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.059
Why would someone else's shit
worry me less than if it was yours?

15:23.088 --> 15:25.466
See, this is why I don't go places
ain't got no name,

15:25.491 --> 15:27.971
so mysterious shit
don't soil my wife's leather.

15:27.993 --> 15:30.974
- It's mostly on the towel.
- What the fuck happened back there?

15:30.996 --> 15:34.341
It was DeShauwn.
He went all DeShauwn.

15:34.366 --> 15:37.142
DeShauwn went all DeShauwn.
So that's DeShauwn's shit?

15:37.169 --> 15:40.150
- It's hazy in my memory.
- Yeah, you know what?

15:40.172 --> 15:41.981
That's probably for the best.
Look, DeShauwn's your boy.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.680
I got nothing but respect for that.

15:43.709 --> 15:46.246
So I'm gonna drop you off, I'm gonna
go on with the rest of my life.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.918
The first step of which
will most surely be in the direction

15:48.948 --> 15:53.055
of a 24-hour car detailer.
(sighs)

15:55.888 --> 15:58.892
You know, keep the towel.
It's my gift.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.607
- I want you to be my manager.
- You got a manager.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.172
I got a problem and you know it.

16:12.204 --> 16:14.115
You'd never let Cam
go to a place like that.

16:14.139 --> 16:18.781
Please. I can't get rid of
DeShauwn on my own.

16:21.246 --> 16:23.522
All right, listen,
I'm... I'm...

16:23.549 --> 16:26.189
Yo.

16:26.218 --> 16:28.528
- They told me you Ubered.
- No, bro, I looked around

16:28.554 --> 16:32.502
- and you was gone.
- That's fucked up, man.

16:32.524 --> 16:35.027
Hey, yo, hey, real talk?
Thank you, Reggie.

16:35.060 --> 16:38.906
Yeah, happy to help.
Stay safe.

16:45.104 --> 16:47.983
- Why didn't you call me?
- Man, I did call. You didn't pick up.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.453
I was getting laid.
How come you didn't call me back?

16:55.714 --> 16:59.992
- You actually smell like butt now.
- (sighs) Sorry.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.999
Jupiter Blackmon wants me
to be his manager.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.632
Top-ten pick in the NFL draft
and he wants me.

17:13.298 --> 17:14.971
DeShauwn's getting fired?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.445
DeShauwned himself
right out of a job.

17:17.469 --> 17:22.542
- Do you want to manage Jupiter?
- Kid needs somebody.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.020
I didn't ask what he needs,
I asked what you want.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.819
- I want to do right by Cam.
- Good night, then.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.628
You big PUSSY-

17:33.585 --> 17:35.826
Can you turn the light
back on, please?

17:35.854 --> 17:39.768
(groans)
I'm tired.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.669
Don't act like you haven't
thought this through.

17:41.693 --> 17:45.436
I want to do right by Cam, I do,
but I also want to build my business.

17:45.464 --> 17:49.037
If I sign Jupiter, I'm not always
gonna be there for Cam.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.571
He's my cousin, Missy.
He's the reason I have a life.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.549
- The reason I have you.
- That's not true.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.745
Well, you say that,
but it's not a theory

17:55.774 --> 17:58.220
I'd like to go back in
a time machine to test out.

17:58.243 --> 18:02.214
<i>'</i> (sighs)
<i>'</i> (sighs)

18:02.247 --> 18:04.284
I'm gonna take a shower.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.387
Reggie.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.989
I could start a management company
with Cam.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.627
We'd be partners, but he wouldn't
actually do anything, right?

18:11.657 --> 18:14.661
The business, me,
would essentially manage Cam, Jupiter,

18:14.693 --> 18:16.798
and whoever else we happen
to sign down the road.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.809
Cam likes money,
which he would have more of

18:18.831 --> 18:20.333
because he'd get half
his commission back

18:20.365 --> 18:22.402
and half of everyone else's
that we sign.

18:23.735 --> 18:25.408
You ready to take a shower now?

18:25.437 --> 18:29.078
- You coming with me?
- I'm so tired.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.145
I'll hold you up.

18:31.176 --> 18:32.746
- Come on.
- Oh.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.225
- You gonna take the bonnet off?
- Why?

18:37.249 --> 18:39.525
'Cause it looks like
black Jiffy Pop on your head.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.997
- I'm gonna pop you in the dick.
- That's all I'm looking for.

18:42.020 --> 18:45.092
(music playing)

18:45.791 --> 18:49.432
- Reggie: What up, fellas?
- Ha! (laughing)

18:49.461 --> 18:52.374
- Got him.
- Man! Damn!

18:53.866 --> 18:56.870
This is the weed of champions,
trust me.

18:56.902 --> 18:59.041
You know what?
No weed for Jupiter.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.312
He's got a piss test
for his upcoming pro day.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.819
Cam, I need to talk to you.
Business.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.912
You want to talk?
Grab that paddle. I'm on a roll.

19:04.943 --> 19:06.923
Jupiter, you know
how many refrigerators we got?

19:06.945 --> 19:09.186
- What, about three?
- Exactly.

19:09.214 --> 19:11.922
And if you knew what was in them,
it'd blow your mind.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.931
Come, follow me.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.990
Follow him.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.796
Let me see the ball.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.306
So, uh, did Jupiter have anything
to say about last night?

19:23.328 --> 19:25.808
He said the afterhours was dope.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.278
I was thinking you and me should start
a management company.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.474
Rep athletes the same way I rep you.

19:31.503 --> 19:34.643
I mean, you and me, we the example that
guys like you and me want to emulate,

19:34.673 --> 19:36.880
so we'll start a business.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.116
So how many additional dudes
would we be signing?

19:39.144 --> 19:41.215
Uh, you know, whatever number
you're comfortable with minus one.

19:41.246 --> 19:44.921
For cushion.
I'm already working Ira, Coke, Bao.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.260
This'll just be another thing
that I'm working. Shit.

19:47.286 --> 19:49.732
You know,
a lot of balls in the air

19:49.755 --> 19:53.828
makes it a lot easier to take our eye
off the ball we're in control of... us.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.897
And Jay 2's repping
baseball players, okay?

19:56.929 --> 19:58.738
The money's out there to be taken,

19:58.764 --> 20:00.641
we just got to say yes
to taking our part.

20:00.666 --> 20:02.646
So what I got to do
for all this money?

20:02.668 --> 20:04.773
You go to the mailbox,
open, smile, repeat.

20:04.803 --> 20:07.249
- Direct deposit's a lot easier.
- So you saying yes?

20:07.272 --> 20:09.309
- Sure, I guess.
- Ooh, yes!

20:09.341 --> 20:11.753
- (laughing)
- And thank you.

20:11.777 --> 20:14.348
- Now here's the really good news.
- Yeah?

20:14.379 --> 20:16.620
Jupiter wants to be our first client.

20:19.251 --> 20:20.992
He ain't say shit to me.

20:21.019 --> 20:23.590
He sprung it on me last night,
you know.

20:23.622 --> 20:24.726
That's opportunity.

20:24.756 --> 20:28.363
And when that comes along, you can
either kick it away or scoop it up.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.135
I mean, he's primed to go top ten.
That's a real money contract.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.700
Even if he flames out,
we will have announced our presence.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.872
We'll be viable.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.609
Serve the ball.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.416
So we gonna do it?
Because I got to tell Jupiter.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.512
And then tomorrow, me and him,
we got to fire DeShauwn.

20:44.543 --> 20:47.387
Isn't DeShauwn
like the you to Jupiter's me?

20:47.412 --> 20:49.915
No, Jupiter ain't you,
DeShauwn ain't me.

20:49.948 --> 20:53.521
Which is why Jupiter
want to be with us.

20:53.552 --> 20:57.159
- Serve.
- Ooh!

20:57.189 --> 20:59.669
I believe the phrase is "got him."

20:59.691 --> 21:01.637
(Reggie laughing)

21:01.660 --> 21:03.765
Nice point, man.
Look, let's finish this later, man.

21:03.795 --> 21:07.140
I'm 'bout to hit the bike.
All right?

21:07.165 --> 21:09.645

- So have you picked a name?
- If it's a boy, Canoe.

21:34.393 --> 21:36.395
If it's a girl, Sparkle.

21:36.428 --> 21:39.034
And if it's both, Larry after my aunt.

21:39.064 --> 21:41.670
Brittany...

21:41.700 --> 21:45.045
has anyone talked to you about the work
that's involved with being a mother?

21:45.070 --> 21:47.744
No, but I'm about to find out.

21:47.773 --> 21:50.276
Well, you do have options.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.720
What are you doing?

21:51.743 --> 21:55.281
I am just telling Brittany here that
she has her whole life ahead of her.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.193
Brittany, ask her
how many babies she has.

21:58.216 --> 22:00.560
- How many babies--
- Then ask her if she knows shit

22:00.585 --> 22:03.759
about what she's talking about or if
she's just doing what she does best...

22:03.789 --> 22:05.962
- judging.
- Do you know shit about what you're--

22:05.991 --> 22:08.972
She needs to hear from somebody
besides you, Mary Charles.

22:08.994 --> 22:13.033
Unless you think climbing out of poverty
is easier when you're holding a baby.

22:13.065 --> 22:17.707
Hey, Brittany, why don't you go over
there and check out the lady on stilts?

22:17.736 --> 22:20.307
- I think she's doing some tricks.
- Yeah, okay.

22:24.443 --> 22:26.081
You think I should've
been aborted, don't you?

22:26.111 --> 22:28.022
How do you get that?
I'm not saying that at all.

22:28.046 --> 22:30.458
- Or adopted.
- She is she, you are you.

22:30.482 --> 22:33.429
And I am who I am
because I am in this family

22:33.452 --> 22:35.762
with my ma, my real ma
who didn't give me away

22:35.787 --> 22:38.461
or vacuumed me out and had me
shipped off to an abortion furnace.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.562
I'm gonna tell you something
that you don't hear nearly enough.

22:41.593 --> 22:44.574
- It's not about you.
- Her story is my ma's story.

22:44.596 --> 22:47.372
- That baby is me. I understand...
- She is a 12-year-old child,

22:47.399 --> 22:50.380
Mary Charles,
that was never given any other options.

22:51.803 --> 22:53.749
Oh, gosh.

22:53.772 --> 22:56.582
- Brittany.
- Brittany.

22:57.642 --> 23:00.851
- Brittany, this is not safe.
- Then why is it here?

23:00.879 --> 23:02.859
It's not safe for pregnant women.

23:02.881 --> 23:06.192
I'm a kid. I don't see a sign that says
"Pregnant kids can't jump in here."

23:06.218 --> 23:09.062
That is because we did not need
a sign like that before today.

23:09.087 --> 23:10.760
Well, whatever happens
was meant to happen

23:10.789 --> 23:12.530
because the baby's
already on its way.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.470
- Okay, your water has to break first.
- Again?

23:15.494 --> 23:17.770
- That was this morning.
- What? Why didn't you tell me?

23:17.796 --> 23:20.538
- I didn't want you to cancel the party.
- No, okay, come on.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.306
Good--
Okay, come-come on out of there.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.644
- Let's go.
- Fine, fine.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.851

23:39.818 --> 23:42.458
Ling-Tsu, congratulations.

23:42.487 --> 23:45.991
(sighs)

23:46.024 --> 23:48.334
(music playing)

24:04.376 --> 24:07.653
Oh, is this some type of playdate?
This don't look good.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.488
All in how you choose to view it.

24:09.514 --> 24:12.085
Now, some people'd look at this
and say that you're about to get fired.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.530
While others would say you're about to
get 4% of Jupiter's first contract

24:15.554 --> 24:19.001
and 2% of his second for doing
absolutely nothing from this day forward

24:19.024 --> 24:21.163
all in consideration
of services rendered.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.070
And who the fuck
do you think you are?

24:23.094 --> 24:25.074
Now, some people
would be angered by this.

24:25.096 --> 24:27.269
Others would say
it is a generous offer

24:27.299 --> 24:29.404
because they'd understand
the obvious alternative.

24:29.434 --> 24:32.347
And some people would say that
you're risking getting a screwdriver

24:32.370 --> 24:34.441
shoved between
your fifth and sixth rib.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.352
And some people would make
amusing and empty threats.

24:37.375 --> 24:40.219
Well, how about I use a hammer
to drive my point home?

24:41.947 --> 24:43.984
Come here.

24:46.284 --> 24:47.695
What's wrong with you, man?

24:47.719 --> 24:50.427
Look, do you really think you can
step inside my Guccis, huh?

24:50.455 --> 24:52.594
I've known this boy
since before he had pubes.

24:52.624 --> 24:55.104
Look, I bought him
his first piece of ass.

24:55.126 --> 24:57.436
- And that ass was my sister's.
- Man, I paid you back for that.

24:57.462 --> 24:59.237
- Jupiter, shut up!
- Reggie: Hey, hey, hey, fellas.

24:59.264 --> 25:01.710
This can be good for everybody, okay?

25:01.733 --> 25:05.408
Jupiter can relax and thrive.
You can thrive and relax.

25:05.437 --> 25:08.748
See, you think you above everybody.

25:08.773 --> 25:12.220
Profiteering off a betrayal of love.

25:12.244 --> 25:16.750
See, the truth is,
you puppeteer Cam like a child.

25:16.781 --> 25:20.319
You got your hand all up his ass
and he kind of like it.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.332
Shit, you like it, too.

25:25.056 --> 25:27.297
Offer's on the table
for another 60 seconds.

25:27.325 --> 25:28.895
Look, don't tick-tock me,
motherfucker.

25:28.927 --> 25:31.237
Look, I will embarrass you
right here and right now.

25:31.263 --> 25:35.040
- 6% first contract, 5% second.
- Four and two.

25:35.066 --> 25:37.512
And the first sideways tweet,
leaked photo,

25:37.536 --> 25:40.415
or sour grapes we hear through
the grapevine, zero and zero.

25:40.438 --> 25:43.647
(sighs)

25:43.675 --> 25:47.248
You know what?
DeShauwn know how this works.

25:47.279 --> 25:50.954
See, one day, you're gonna
step into an office, Reggie,

25:50.982 --> 25:53.121
and Cam is gonna be
with a new Reggie.

25:53.151 --> 25:56.189
And the new Reggie's gonna do what
Reggie's doing to DeShauwn right now.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.963
Well, when that day comes,
Reggie will remind Reggie you said that.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.596
Draw up the paperwork.

26:01.626 --> 26:05.039
Gentlemen, go fuck yourselves.

26:07.165 --> 26:09.873
- (exhales sharply)
- You did the right thing.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.279
And doing the right thing
ain't always easy. Thank you.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.841
I paid him back for his sister.
I did.

26:14.873 --> 26:18.616
She was fine when she was 14.
22, mmm, not so good.

26:18.643 --> 26:20.953

26:24.149 --> 26:27.392
Reporter: 37 points,
six rebounds, nine assists.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.161
On fire and back in the saddle.
What do you have to say?

26:30.188 --> 26:32.498
- Going home to watch SportsCenter.
- (laughter)

26:32.524 --> 26:34.561
Do you feel like the fans
were behind you tonight?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.800
Atlanta's a great town.
Great fans.

26:36.828 --> 26:38.865
