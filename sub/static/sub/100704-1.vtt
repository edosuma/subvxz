Did he love Phil?

15:59.583 --> 16:01.543
Do you think Jerry Krause resents that?

17:35.637 --> 17:37.056
How much French do you know?

17:48.901 --> 17:51.528
Michael, what do you think
about the Eiffel Tower?

21:42.301 --> 21:46.888
This is your mom reading aloud
a letter home from you.

30:54.978 --> 30:58.773
One of the articles I read, they called it
"The Bulls' traveling cocaine circus."

31:11.452 --> 31:13.788
Accurate?

40:23.254 --> 40:26.173
Don't mess up. Don't mess up.

41:07.965 --> 41:10.468
You gotta set me up with a schedule
for when I get back.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.386
Get this shit taken care of.

42:58.784 --> 43:00.995
Your first championship.
Congratulations, dog.

43:01.078 --> 43:03.706
I'll get a bottle of champagne
with you tonight. How's that sound?

43:04.707 --> 43:05.958
Can I get a hug, too?

43:09.461 --> 43:12.298
-It don't count.
-I'm gonna hug Jeffrey and Marcus, then.

43:12.381 --> 43:15.134
-I won a championship, I'mma go tell them.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.265
Can I have your...

43:50.919 --> 43:52.630
Don't let Jerry get it.

46:15.439 --> 46:18.984
<i>This is the last night we celebrate</i>
<i>the championship of last year.</i>

46:19.067 --> 46:21.403
It's going to be a nice celebration,
and we'll enjoy it.

46:21.487 --> 46:24.948
What's important is winning this game.
We've got to start off with a win.

46:25.032 --> 46:26.742
So get yourself back in tune

46:26.825 --> 46:29.286
to what we have to do,
and take care of business tonight.

47:04.071 --> 47:06.198
Yeah, we just gonna warm up, right now.

47:07.241 --> 47:09.493
Look, Jerry, you wanna
do some layups with us?

47:09.576 --> 47:10.410
Yep.

47:11.119 --> 47:12.746
They gotta lower the rim.

49:03.565 --> 49:06.735
Let us get refocused back in this game,
get out of the blocks quickly,

49:06.818 --> 49:08.654
and let's do what we did last time.
