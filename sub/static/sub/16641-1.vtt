We welcome you
this evening

03:03.684 --> 03:05.186
to the greatest,

03:05.352 --> 03:06.687
the most authentic...

03:07.146 --> 03:09.982
Wild west show
in America!

03:10.482 --> 03:14.486
So hang on to
your hats and boots...

03:15.196 --> 03:17.573
Or your
loved one's hand.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.283
<i>I understand.</i>

03:20.034 --> 03:22.661
Let us take you
back to a time

03:22.912 --> 03:27.458
when the cowboys and Indians
roamed our great land.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.711
And now for our first act
this evening,

03:31.128 --> 03:35.299
Chief Big Eagle...
the great-great-grandson

03:35.466 --> 03:39.178
of the great
Apache Indian Chief Geronimo,

03:39.345 --> 03:43.891
will perform his legendary
rattlesnake dance

03:44.058 --> 03:47.686
that no white man
has ever seen before.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.355
And that's for sure.

03:49.772 --> 03:51.440
Chief Big Eagle!

03:59.073 --> 04:01.200
Tchi-tchi-wah!

04:26.558 --> 04:30.312
<i>Eeyeow-aiee!</i>

04:30.479 --> 04:32.856
I'm awful scared,
Bronco Billy.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.594
Well, everybody's
a little nervous

04:34.692 --> 04:36.277
their first night
in show business.

04:36.986 --> 04:38.153
You just do
what we rehearsed,

04:38.320 --> 04:39.905
and everything
will be fine.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.866
Yeah, but I'm awful
scared, Bronco Billy.

04:47.746 --> 04:48.831
Take a swig of this.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.249
It'll make you
feel great.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.002
The chief got bit again
by the rattlesnake.

04:53.669 --> 04:54.753
Damn.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.523
Running water took him
back to their truck

04:56.547 --> 04:58.507
and gave him a shot
of doc's snakebite.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.342
I don't know why
he can't just do

05:00.509 --> 05:02.803
the great Apache
flaming arrow act.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.014
I thought you told him
to use a gopher snake.

05:05.431 --> 05:07.725
I did, but he's
a proud Indian.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.560
The only good Indian's
a dead Indian.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.771
Let's go, girl.

05:57.066 --> 06:01.028
How about a big hand
for lasso Leonard James,

06:01.445 --> 06:04.490
the greatest rope artist
in the west?

06:05.074 --> 06:06.241
Yeah.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.536
And now, ladies
and gentlemen,

06:10.204 --> 06:12.706
it is my privilege
and honor

06:12.873 --> 06:14.792
to present
to you this evening

06:14.958 --> 06:17.419
the greatest
trick shooter...

06:19.671 --> 06:21.465
The fastest draw...

06:23.384 --> 06:25.177
<i>The toughest hombre...</i>

06:25.511 --> 06:31.850
The one and only
Bronco Billy McCoy!

06:50.994 --> 06:53.455
<i>Hey! Hey, hey,
how about it?</i>

06:54.665 --> 06:56.625
How about it?
Yeah!

07:09.388 --> 07:10.388
Yeah!

07:17.729 --> 07:20.399
<i>Yeah, Bronco,
climb a board!</i>

07:56.768 --> 07:58.228
Terrific!

08:02.691 --> 08:03.859
Thank you, folks.

08:04.026 --> 08:06.028
Thank you, my little
partners out there.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.280
<i>It's always great to be
back in Montana</i>

08:08.447 --> 08:09.865
<i>and see all of our friends.</i>

08:10.782 --> 08:11.902
Now I'd like
to introduce you

08:11.950 --> 08:13.535
to my new assistant.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.579
It's her first night
in the big tent,

08:15.746 --> 08:17.414
so how about
a big Montana welcome

08:17.581 --> 08:19.917
for Miss Mitzi Fritz?

08:28.342 --> 08:29.676
Throw up
the plates.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.524
Throw up
another plate.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Bronco Billy!</i>

09:02.709 --> 09:04.044
<i>Yeah!</i>

09:10.384 --> 09:13.554
And now, I want all
of you settlers

09:13.845 --> 09:16.890
and all of those little partners
to sit tight.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.643
<i>Beca use Bronco Billy
is getting ready</i>

09:19.810 --> 09:24.398
<i>to do his death-defying
wheel of fortune shootout.</i>

09:24.606 --> 09:26.191
Bronco Billy!

09:26.650 --> 09:28.652
Are those
real bullets?

09:28.819 --> 09:29.819
It's a special
buckshot.

09:29.903 --> 09:30.988
It doesn't go
too far.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.365
But don't worry.
I never miss.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.246
Miss Mitzi...

09:39.788 --> 09:42.124
Would you like
a blindfold?

09:42.291 --> 09:43.959
No, Bronco Billy.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.503
You're the best shot
in the old west.

09:46.670 --> 09:47.670
Very well,

09:47.754 --> 09:49.631
but I will wear one.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.471
Are you ready,
Miss Mitzi?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.849
Yes, Bronco Billy.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.057
All right.

10:00.684 --> 10:01.852
Spin the wheel.

10:18.619 --> 10:19.577
Aah!

10:19.578 --> 10:21.455
Aah!

10:51.151 --> 10:53.028
How much money we got
in the kitty, Billy?

10:53.278 --> 10:55.072
$19 and some change.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.866
Ain't nobody can ever
say we're getting rich.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.160
I'll just be glad when
we get to the next town.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.580
Yeah, that's good,
too, but, uh, I...

11:03.747 --> 11:05.183
If something's sticking
in your craw,

11:05.207 --> 11:06.667
why don't you just
spit it on out?

11:07.292 --> 11:09.836
You know, me and
the boys been with you

11:10.003 --> 11:12.047
down the road, through
hell and high water.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.383
If there's a fight,
we stick together, right?

11:14.716 --> 11:16.510
We know you've done
the same for us.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.804
Look, doc, if it's about
that little gal,

11:19.304 --> 11:20.221
you know how hard it is

11:20.222 --> 11:22.057
to find a good assistant
nowadays.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.767
You just tell the boys

11:23.934 --> 11:25.254
that I'm going
to find us an angel

11:25.394 --> 11:27.562
that will make us all proud
to have her in the show.

11:27.813 --> 11:31.441
They understand about
all that, Billy, but, uh...

11:31.608 --> 11:33.276
What the hell
are you talking about?

11:35.112 --> 11:38.240
You know the boys
love you, and so do I,

11:38.448 --> 11:39.658
but, Billy,
unless we get paid,

11:39.825 --> 11:40.741
we're going
to have to quit

11:40.742 --> 11:42.911
because it's been
6 months.

11:57.426 --> 11:58.593
What's going on?

11:58.760 --> 12:01.054
Get out of my truck,
you yellow-bellied sidewinder.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.054
It's raining.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.390
Get out!

12:06.101 --> 12:08.228
What in tarnation is he
all heated up about?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.230
I just told him
we all going to quit

12:10.397 --> 12:11.565
unless we got paid.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.612
Why'd you have to tell him
while it was raining?

12:14.609 --> 12:16.570
Get out of my truck,
you ingrates.

12:16.737 --> 12:17.863
Don't you swear
at my wife.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.990
Get out
of my truck!

12:22.409 --> 12:23.744
We never should've
elected you

12:23.910 --> 12:25.829
to tell him
in the first damn place.

12:26.455 --> 12:27.956
What you
talking about, man?

12:28.123 --> 12:30.834
We drew straws,
and I lost, remember?

12:31.168 --> 12:32.168
Yeah.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.837
So, it's money
you want, huh?

12:34.504 --> 12:36.190
Well, I'm not going
to have a pack of wolves

12:36.214 --> 12:38.091
snapping at my heels
for money.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.761
You think when I
look at the faces

12:40.927 --> 12:41.928
of those little partners

12:42.095 --> 12:43.156
out there smiling
in the audience,

12:43.180 --> 12:44.431
I'm thinking
about money?

12:45.807 --> 12:47.243
All the good times
we've been through...

12:47.267 --> 12:48.667
and there have been
a lot of them...

12:48.769 --> 12:49.769
and all the bad times,

12:49.895 --> 12:51.021
it breaks my heart
to think

12:51.188 --> 12:53.607
the only reason you all
came down the trail with me

12:53.774 --> 12:54.858
was for money.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.985
I thought I had
the best bunch,

12:57.152 --> 12:59.196
but I guess I've been
dealt a crooked hand.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.072
Look, boss, it ain't
what you're thinking.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.116
Nobody wants to quit
the outfit.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.702
It's just... Well,
I haven't had enough money

13:05.827 --> 13:06.827
to go into a bar

13:06.870 --> 13:08.670
and buy a pretty girl
a drink in over a month.

13:08.830 --> 13:09.956
You think I have?

13:10.123 --> 13:11.563
You promised me
I'd have enough money

13:11.708 --> 13:12.959
to buy a wooden hand
this year.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.520
You should've never
blown that hand off

13:14.544 --> 13:15.544
in the first place.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.380
I told you that shotgun
act wouldn't work.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.717
Running water and I
want to buy a new bed.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.677
We're sick and tired
of sleeping on straw.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.763
You two would still be
out on the reservation

13:24.930 --> 13:26.681
drinking bad whiskey
if it wasn't for me.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.064
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm sick
of being on the wagon,

13:29.100 --> 13:30.977
and I'm sick of
drinking plain water.

13:31.061 --> 13:33.104
We all know what you
used to do for a drink,

13:33.480 --> 13:34.606
and we forgive you
for it,

13:34.773 --> 13:36.453
but if you want to go
back to wool blankets

13:36.608 --> 13:38.777
and dirty sheets,
it's all right with me.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.487
I need new ropes.

13:40.612 --> 13:41.655
You young
cowpunchers today

13:41.780 --> 13:43.281
don't take care
of your gear.

13:43.406 --> 13:44.950
I have told you
a hundred times...

13:45.116 --> 13:47.035
wrap your ropes
after every show.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.411
I know my job.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.330
Then know it better,
you hear?

13:50.622 --> 13:52.624
Why don't we all
get back in the truck

13:52.791 --> 13:54.042
and get on down
the trail?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.502
We're getting hungry.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.379
I say we get it over
right now.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.047
Nobody wants it over.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.842
How about
the rest of you?

14:04.135 --> 14:05.303
You're right, boss.

14:05.637 --> 14:08.181
Running water and I
owe you our lives.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.142
Where would I go?

14:11.476 --> 14:12.894
As soon as we get
some money,

14:13.061 --> 14:14.312
then I'll get some ropes.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.982
You're all going
to get what you want,

14:17.107 --> 14:18.400
I promise you.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.985
I save every dime,
every nickel

14:20.151 --> 14:21.528
goes into
that little tin box,

14:21.820 --> 14:23.673
and one of these days,
we'll get that ranch we want,

14:23.697 --> 14:25.240
so city kids
can come out

14:25.991 --> 14:28.368
<i>and see what cowboys
and Indians are really like.</i>

14:29.202 --> 14:30.912
<i>Then we can all
settle down.</i>

14:31.746 --> 14:33.506
You're the best bunch
of wranglers in America

14:33.582 --> 14:34.958
and don't you ever
forget it.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.477
And you're riding
with Bronco Billy,

14:36.501 --> 14:37.752
the fastest draw
in the west.

14:38.753 --> 14:39.796
Now let's hit the trail.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.756
- Yay!
- All right!

15:01.234 --> 15:02.736
I'll go get the permit.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.488
You all go get
something to eat.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.204
All right,
Mr. Arlington,

15:13.371 --> 15:16.583
if you will both sign
right there and pay me $10.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.210
Then you can go upstairs
to judge carbon's office

15:19.544 --> 15:21.463
and... be married.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.594
Darling.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.024
Thank you.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.449
Darling!

15:52.035 --> 15:53.662
Don't walk so fast.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.831
I shall walk
as fast as I please.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.459
Light me.

16:00.418 --> 16:01.795
Antoinette,
darling...

16:02.671 --> 16:04.673
You know how much
I love you.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.925
Please,
let's not be maudlin.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.386
But I do love you,
my pet.

16:09.552 --> 16:10.679
We need each other.

16:11.179 --> 16:14.307
I need to marry someone,
anyone, before Saturday,

16:14.474 --> 16:16.518
when I reach
the disgusting age of 30,

16:16.810 --> 16:19.145
or I shall lose many, many
wonderful millions of dollars

16:19.312 --> 16:20.814
my darling daddy left me.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.066
And you need my money.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.694
I know you're as broke
as these vulgar Idaho farmers,

16:25.860 --> 16:28.363
so, uh... Let's not
talk about love, shall we?

16:28.613 --> 16:29.613
Let's get this thing
over with

16:29.614 --> 16:31.825
as painlessly
as possible, hmm?

17:09.237 --> 17:10.714
Might there be an auto
mechanic on duty?

17:10.739 --> 17:11.739
What's the problem?

17:11.781 --> 17:13.060
I believe my engine's
burning up.

17:13.491 --> 17:14.576
Pop the hood.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.294
Just exactly how long
is this going to take?

17:25.420 --> 17:26.628
There's a hole
in your radiator

17:26.796 --> 17:28.506
the size of a potato.

17:30.425 --> 17:31.801
Well, then,
repair it.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.471
It won't be ready
till tomorrow.

17:34.637 --> 17:35.638
What?

17:39.184 --> 17:40.226
Tomorrow?

17:40.602 --> 17:42.270
<i>Yep. Got to make
a trip into town</i>

17:42.437 --> 17:44.147
<i>to pick up
a new radiator.</i>

17:44.314 --> 17:46.524
I'll pay you double
what you normally get

17:46.691 --> 17:48.627
if you'll just have this
thing repaired by tonight.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.570
<i>I could sure use
the extra money,</i>

17:50.820 --> 17:53.281
but your car won't be ready
till tomorrow.

17:54.074 --> 17:57.285
Oh, marvelous. You and
your rented limousines.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.705
Why in hell did we
get married in Idaho?

18:01.498 --> 18:02.999
I thought sun valley

18:03.166 --> 18:05.418
would be a good place
for a honeymoon.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.296
<i>I just want to get back
to New York.</i>

18:09.214 --> 18:10.632
You want her fixed?

18:12.509 --> 18:15.011
Sometimes she
makes me so mad,

18:15.178 --> 18:16.513
I could kill her!

18:25.355 --> 18:27.357
Stick 'em up,
or I'll plug you.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.294
I ought to have
the whole bunch of you

18:30.318 --> 18:31.903
strung up
for cattle-rustling.

18:32.403 --> 18:34.823
We just wanted to talk
to Bronco Billy.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.158
All right. Turn around
nice and easy.

18:42.664 --> 18:43.664
You mean
you little pards

18:43.790 --> 18:45.875
played hooky from school
just to come see me?

18:46.167 --> 18:48.128
Wow! Look at
his guns!

18:48.461 --> 18:50.755
He really <i>is</i>
Bronco Billy!

18:50.964 --> 18:52.382
Put your hands down.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.969
Are you really
the fastest gun in the west?

18:59.931 --> 19:02.308
- Wow!
- Wow! - Wow!

19:02.475 --> 19:04.686
Ain't nobody faster
than Bronco Billy.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.107
Now, look,
I don't take kindly

19:09.274 --> 19:11.192
to kids playing hooky
from school.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.528
I think every kid in America
ought to go to school,

19:13.695 --> 19:15.363
at least up through
the eighth grade.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.907
We don't go to school
today, Bronco Billy.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.534
It's Saturday.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.914
Well, I been riding
late last night.

19:25.623 --> 19:26.916
A man's brain
gets kind of fuzzy

19:27.083 --> 19:28.501
when he's
been on the range.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.044
Well, I'll
tell you what...

19:30.211 --> 19:31.838
because you're all
such goodhearted

19:32.005 --> 19:34.132
little cowboys
and cowgirls,

19:34.299 --> 19:35.699
and you say your
prayers each night,

19:36.593 --> 19:38.233
I'm going to give you
one free ticket each

19:38.303 --> 19:40.388
to the greatest
wild west show on earth.

19:40.763 --> 19:41.890
And, uh...

19:42.056 --> 19:45.476
I want you to bring
your folks... Tonight.

19:46.477 --> 19:47.477
- Thanks!
- Thanks!

19:47.478 --> 19:48.563
You're welcome.

19:50.023 --> 19:50.898
Don't come late.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.025
You might
not get a seat.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.614
Billy, where are
you heading?

19:57.780 --> 19:59.324
I'm going into town.

20:00.617 --> 20:01.910
I got to find me a woman

20:02.535 --> 20:03.912
who can shoot
like Annie Oakley,

20:04.329 --> 20:05.413
ride like Belle Starr,

20:05.580 --> 20:06.820
and who ain't
afraid of nothing.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.500
I hope you find one.
Be careful.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.822
Are you Bronco Billy?

20:39.989 --> 20:41.449
I sure am, ma'am.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.660
You sure got
a neat car.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.662
Woman,
what's your name?

20:45.954 --> 20:48.039
Delores,
Delores Duke.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.667
Well, it's a pleasure
meeting you, Miss Delores.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.336
Tell me,
would you, uh...

20:53.503 --> 20:54.754
Like to go
for a little ride

20:54.921 --> 20:56.005
when you
get off work?

22:00.069 --> 22:01.195
Jesus.

22:04.782 --> 22:05.950
Oh.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.622
I'm certainly glad someone
is enjoying our honeymoon.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.794
You... you really
should have come

22:16.961 --> 22:20.089
to the wild west show,
darling.

22:21.424 --> 22:22.550
It was...

22:22.884 --> 22:24.677
Wonderfully corny.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.306
You would have gotten
a big laugh out of it.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.986
Turn out your light.
I want to go to bed.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.199
Yes, dear.

22:47.241 --> 22:48.409
Aren't you...

22:49.243 --> 22:52.455
Going to wash that
stuff off your face?

22:53.331 --> 22:54.624
I shall wash my face

22:54.749 --> 22:56.584
when I want
to wash my face.

23:03.049 --> 23:06.552
<i>Will you take your
wet tongue out of my ear?</i>

23:07.178 --> 23:08.178
<i>But I'm
your husband.</i>

23:08.262 --> 23:10.598
<i>That doesn't give you
license to maul me.</i>

23:11.682 --> 23:13.976
<i>You frigid spinster!</i>

23:14.143 --> 23:15.746
<i>If you had any blood
in your veins at all,</i>

23:15.770 --> 23:16.770
you'd know what to do.

23:16.938 --> 23:20.316
No wonder you've...
Never gotten married.

23:21.401 --> 23:24.445
Are you finished
with your little speech?

23:24.612 --> 23:27.323
Darling, I just want
to make you happy,

23:28.366 --> 23:32.412
but you...
Frustrate me no end.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.080
Finished?

23:34.997 --> 23:35.997
Yes.

23:36.624 --> 23:39.293
If you ever lay
a hand on me again

23:39.460 --> 23:41.087
without first
asking my permission,

23:41.295 --> 23:43.297
I shall cut you
out of my universe,

23:43.464 --> 23:45.383
starting at the bank.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.385
Yes, dear.

23:51.556 --> 23:52.849
<i>Darling?</i>

23:54.767 --> 23:57.186
<i>May I put my hand
on your breast?</i>

23:58.187 --> 23:59.188
<i>No.</i>

24:13.536 --> 24:16.456
Wait here. I'm going
to cash a $3.00 check.

24:16.622 --> 24:17.622
All right.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.129
Watch yourself.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.715
Be back in a minute.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.190
Thank you, sir.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.235
Cash a check here?

24:46.402 --> 24:47.403
OK.

24:48.905 --> 24:49.905
$3.00?

24:49.989 --> 24:52.992
Yeah. I'd like it in
2 singles and 4 quarters.

24:53.701 --> 24:56.871
No, wait a second. Make that
2 quarters and 5 dimes.

24:57.038 --> 24:58.206
What's it going
to be, fella?

24:58.372 --> 24:59.707
<i>It's a stickup!</i>

25:01.334 --> 25:02.934
All right, everybody
up against the wall.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.212
You, too, Tex.

25:04.712 --> 25:05.755
Come on, move!

25:28.027 --> 25:30.154
John... do hurry.

25:30.321 --> 25:32.114
I want to take my bath.

25:33.699 --> 25:37.119
I hope your rented
limousine's been repaired.

25:46.629 --> 25:47.713
John?

25:57.056 --> 25:58.056
Oh, my god.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.103
Hello! I've been robbed!

26:02.395 --> 26:03.729
Newsbeat 7,
Mr. Bronco.

26:03.896 --> 26:04.896
<i>Bronco Billy's the name.</i>

26:05.022 --> 26:07.149
Me and my wild west show
are camped off of I-80.

26:07.316 --> 26:08.316
Sure, uh, Bronco Billy,

26:08.401 --> 26:10.161
when did you feel it was
time to take action?

26:10.278 --> 26:12.446
It's always time to take
action when there's danger.

26:12.947 --> 26:14.883
I want to invite all you
little partners out there

26:14.907 --> 26:16.760
to come out and see
the Bronco Billy wild west show,

26:16.784 --> 26:17.785
right off of I-80.

26:17.994 --> 26:20.538
Here's the manager
of the bank.

26:20.705 --> 26:22.265
I want to shake
your hand, Bronco Billy,

26:22.331 --> 26:23.248
and I want
to thank you...

26:23.249 --> 26:24.792
the first show
is at 7:30,

26:25.001 --> 26:27.128
and I want you to come out
and see Bronco Billy...

26:27.295 --> 26:28.535
the quickest draw,
fastest shot,

26:28.629 --> 26:30.149
quickest hombre
this side of the Pecos.

26:30.298 --> 26:31.757
Right off I-80.

26:34.468 --> 26:35.636
Oh!

26:35.803 --> 26:36.929
Hello!

26:39.807 --> 26:40.808
Hello?

26:44.186 --> 26:45.186
Hello.

26:49.859 --> 26:50.859
Oh!

26:58.492 --> 27:00.036
Oh, charming.

27:02.496 --> 27:03.623
<i>Attendant!</i>

27:03.789 --> 27:04.874
Attendant!

27:05.249 --> 27:06.292
You there!

27:08.419 --> 27:09.920
Heard you
the first time.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.591
Did my husband,
the man in the limousine...

27:13.966 --> 27:15.426
Did he say
when he'd be back?

27:15.593 --> 27:16.593
No.

27:17.470 --> 27:18.804
Could I use
your telephone?

27:19.555 --> 27:20.848
It's right outside
there.

27:21.015 --> 27:22.475
It works on dimes.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.477
Well, you see,
my husband seems to be

27:24.644 --> 27:25.728
playing
a little joke on me.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.021
He's taken my purse.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.273
Run off, has he?

27:30.399 --> 27:31.609
Could you lend me a dime?

27:31.776 --> 27:33.653
I just want to dial
the operator.

27:33.903 --> 27:34.904
No.

27:35.821 --> 27:36.821
Well, why not?

27:37.239 --> 27:38.658
Because I ain't
got a dime.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.785
But you have
a telephone.

27:41.202 --> 27:42.745
It works on dimes.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.997
Well, then why don't you
take a dime

27:45.164 --> 27:46.684
out of your stupid little
cash register

27:46.791 --> 27:48.459
and let me use it
to call the operator?

27:48.709 --> 27:50.461
I'll give it
right back to you.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.172
Ain't mine to give.

28:05.559 --> 28:06.977
Nice looking,
ain't she?

28:07.895 --> 28:11.315
At my age, that's about
all I can do is look.

28:12.525 --> 28:13.901
She live
around here?

28:14.193 --> 28:16.987
Her husband ran off
and left her this morning.

28:19.490 --> 28:20.616
The man's
got to be a fool

28:20.783 --> 28:22.576
to run off and leave
something like that.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.122
Maybe... maybe not.

28:27.915 --> 28:30.042
Sir, you have
a good day.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.921
Same to you,
young feller.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.674
Good morning,
ma'am.

28:36.841 --> 28:38.551
Can I be
of service to you?

28:43.514 --> 28:44.515
Yes.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.435
Would you be kind enough
to lend me a dime?

28:48.018 --> 28:50.187
Why, sure. Come on
across the street.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.189
That's where I keep
my money... in my truck.

28:56.485 --> 28:57.485
Coming?

29:05.661 --> 29:07.621
My name's
Bronco Billy McCoy,

29:07.872 --> 29:08.872
and yours?

29:09.081 --> 29:11.751
Bronco. What
an amusing name.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.878
My friends
call me Billy.

29:14.670 --> 29:15.921
Come and get it.

29:18.424 --> 29:19.424
Oh!

29:23.596 --> 29:24.916
Where's that dime
you promised me?

29:25.014 --> 29:26.599
Shoot.
I wanted an orange soda.

29:26.766 --> 29:27.975
I wanted a
strawberry.

29:28.142 --> 29:29.477
Boys, this is, um...

29:29.643 --> 29:30.643
Antoinette Lily.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.354
Miss Antoinette Lily.

29:33.147 --> 29:34.249
You're the prettiest
assistant

29:34.273 --> 29:35.357
the boss ever hired.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.524
I sure hope you can ride
better than that last gal.

29:37.902 --> 29:40.029
Wait. Wait.

29:40.488 --> 29:43.032
Chief Big Eagle and his wife
Lorraine Running Water...

29:43.199 --> 29:44.450
Miss Antoinette Lily.

29:44.617 --> 29:45.492
Miss Lily.

29:45.493 --> 29:47.119
All right, boys,
we got to get moving.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.871
Let's get to work.

29:50.915 --> 29:51.957
What an honor.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.502
The dime!

29:54.794 --> 29:56.629
I wanted a
Dr. Pepper.

29:56.796 --> 29:59.131
Doc Lynch, this is
Miss Antoinette Lily.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.258
Ma'am, welcome
to Bronco Billy's

30:01.425 --> 30:02.718
wild west show.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.279
I hope you'll be
very happy with us here.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.739
All right, let's quit
chewing the fat.

30:05.763 --> 30:06.721
We got work to do.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.140
We'll talk
later, my dear.

30:08.516 --> 30:09.516
Yeah.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.394
You'll be paid
a good wage

30:12.561 --> 30:13.561
for an honest day's work.

30:13.687 --> 30:14.730
Room and board are free.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.774
Look, you
promised me a dime.

30:16.941 --> 30:17.857
Do you ride?

30:17.858 --> 30:19.985
Ride? You mean
a horse?

30:20.569 --> 30:21.737
This dime will be deducted

30:21.904 --> 30:23.155
from your
first week's salary.

30:23.614 --> 30:25.741
Now, go ahead
and make your call.

30:27.076 --> 30:28.536
We got to hit
the trail.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.668
You sure are pretty.

30:50.599 --> 30:51.599
<i>Operator.</i>

30:51.642 --> 30:52.935
Oh, thank god
you're there.

30:53.227 --> 30:54.454
I'd like to place
a collect call please

30:54.478 --> 30:55.311
to New York,

30:55.312 --> 30:58.399
area code
212-966-7058,

30:58.566 --> 30:59.692
to Mrs. Irene Lily.

30:59.859 --> 31:00.733
<i>Your name, please?</i>

31:00.734 --> 31:02.236
This is
Antoinette Lily.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.867
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am,
that line's busy.</i>

31:08.033 --> 31:09.326
<i>Would you like
to try later?</i>

31:09.493 --> 31:10.578
Yes!

31:15.624 --> 31:17.668
Give me back
my dime!

31:20.296 --> 31:21.755
This isn't happening.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.094
Would you drive me
to the next town?

31:27.261 --> 31:28.679
Why, certainly, ma'am.

32:04.798 --> 32:06.300
I tell you that
John Arlington

32:06.467 --> 32:08.636
has murdered my helpless
little stepdaughter.

32:08.928 --> 32:10.238
I never should have
let them marry.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.347
What could you
have done?

32:11.597 --> 32:13.223
Well, I am
the family attorney.

32:13.682 --> 32:14.682
All of his wives

32:14.683 --> 32:17.102
seem to disappear
so mysteriously.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.940
Now, don't go getting
yourself upset.

32:21.106 --> 32:24.860
What'll become of me
if she has met her end?

32:25.069 --> 32:26.862
If that is the case,

32:27.571 --> 32:28.989
you are next in line

32:29.156 --> 32:31.784
for her departed
father's fortune.

32:36.914 --> 32:38.415
I just want her back,

32:38.582 --> 32:40.125
safe in my arms.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.711
But we both know
Antoinette would want me

32:42.878 --> 32:44.004
to carry on.

32:44.380 --> 32:45.589
Chin up?

32:46.131 --> 32:48.092
I'll call the police
immediately.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.718
Oh, Edgar...

32:50.302 --> 32:52.262
You're such
a comfort.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.613
♪ ♪ We're barroom buddies ♪ ♪

33:09.780 --> 33:11.115

33:11.281 --> 33:13.617

33:18.872 --> 33:21.625
Must you sing
that disgusting music?

33:22.418 --> 33:23.292
Do you want to sing

33:23.293 --> 33:24.878
a duet of
<i>barroom buddies?</i>

33:25.045 --> 33:28.590
No, I don't want to sing
a duet of <i>barroom buddies,</i>

33:28.716 --> 33:30.796
and if I'd only known you
were going to the next town

33:30.926 --> 33:32.320
instead of the one
nearest the motel,

33:32.344 --> 33:34.596
I would never have
got into this vehicle.

33:35.889 --> 33:36.890
I know it must be tough

33:37.057 --> 33:39.101
having the man you love run
off with another woman,

33:39.476 --> 33:40.269
but things
will be better

33:40.436 --> 33:41.436
now that you're
with the show.

33:41.437 --> 33:43.522
My husband did not run off
with another woman,

33:43.689 --> 33:46.817
and I have no intention
of working in your show.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.512
Were you messing
with another man?

33:48.652 --> 33:50.612
No, I wasn't messing
with another man,

33:50.779 --> 33:53.282
and furthermore, my life
is not your concern!

33:53.449 --> 33:55.200
Shh! You're gonna
wake up doc.

33:55.409 --> 33:57.244
Don't tell me what to do.

33:58.245 --> 34:00.539
Look, I'm your boss,
and don't you forget it.

34:00.956 --> 34:04.126
You are nothing but
an illiterate cowboy.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.342
Nobody talks that way
to Bronco Billy.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.471
Take your
hands off me!

34:34.406 --> 34:35.525
You better get in,
Miss Lily.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.242
It's a long ways
to the next town.

34:42.706 --> 34:43.746
What happened
to Miss Lily?

34:44.166 --> 34:45.708
I threw her out
on the road.

34:46.335 --> 34:47.335
Oh.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.250
I'll have him thrown in jail
for the rest of his life

34:50.339 --> 34:51.547
for kidnapping.

34:51.799 --> 34:53.967
Who does he think he is,
treating me this way?

34:54.176 --> 34:55.761
Why, he's Bronco Billy,

34:55.969 --> 34:58.806
the best friend a man
ever had besides his wife.

34:59.306 --> 35:00.306
Best friend.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.810
He hasn't understood a word
I've said to him all day.

35:03.727 --> 35:05.604
The boss has a lot
of responsibilities

35:05.771 --> 35:06.771
running the show.

35:06.897 --> 35:10.651
Ohh. When do we get
to the next village?

35:11.235 --> 35:13.153
Just try to get some
shuteye, Miss Lily.

35:15.489 --> 35:16.489
We'll see.

35:17.032 --> 35:19.076
How dare he put
his hands on me.

35:20.702 --> 35:22.913
Nobody says that
about a cowboy.

35:54.236 --> 35:57.281
Miss Lily! I thought
you left us last night.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.324
That lunatic
tried to kill me.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.161
He's a very good man
once you know him.

36:02.452 --> 36:03.452
Where are we?

36:03.579 --> 36:05.164
You see, we put on
a lot of shows

36:05.330 --> 36:08.250
for orphanages and hospitals
throughout the country.

36:11.712 --> 36:13.213
<i>Children, children.</i>

36:13.839 --> 36:15.132
Let us all have our lunch,

36:15.299 --> 36:17.009
then we can
thank Bronco Billy

36:17.176 --> 36:18.677
for his
wild west show.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.431
Billy, I hope you and
your friends will join us

36:22.598 --> 36:23.807
for lunch and prayer.

36:24.266 --> 36:26.810
If you don't mind a few
sinners at the table,

36:27.936 --> 36:29.479
we'd love to,
thank you.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.773
All right, boys,
let's take a break

36:32.107 --> 36:33.400
and have some chow.

36:38.405 --> 36:39.740
I realize you ain't
with the show,

36:39.907 --> 36:42.951
but... you're welcome
to have lunch with us.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.639
Would Bronco Billy
give the prayer?

37:06.725 --> 37:07.726
Sure.

37:10.604 --> 37:12.189
Lord, we, uh, ask you

37:12.356 --> 37:13.523
to forgive us
for our sins,

37:13.690 --> 37:15.734
and we want to
thank you, lord,

37:15.901 --> 37:17.527
for the great chow...

37:17.945 --> 37:19.905
<i>food that we're
having here today.</i>

37:20.572 --> 37:21.489
And we ask you, lord,

37:21.490 --> 37:23.450
to look after these little
cowboys and cowgirls

37:23.617 --> 37:25.619
and show them the way
to a good life

37:25.786 --> 37:27.037
so they don't
get tangled up

37:27.204 --> 37:29.957
with hard liquor
and cigarettes.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.084
Amen.

37:39.508 --> 37:40.968
Sister, may I use
your telephone?

37:41.635 --> 37:43.470
Oh, I'm sorry. We don't
have a telephone.

37:43.637 --> 37:44.972
We can't afford one.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.602
Just exactly how much
do you pay Mr. Bronco

37:50.769 --> 37:52.271
for this performance?

37:52.437 --> 37:53.437
Pay?

37:53.480 --> 37:55.899
Why, Billy and his friends
come here every year.

37:56.066 --> 37:57.693
They make
the children happy,

37:58.110 --> 37:59.611
but they don't get paid.

38:05.158 --> 38:08.704
<i>So I said to one-eyed Charlie, the
famous desperado, "if you mess with me,</i>

38:08.870 --> 38:10.431
<i>"you better make
your peace with the lord</i>

38:10.455 --> 38:11.623
"'cause I'm faster
and tougher

38:11.790 --> 38:13.417
than you are,
you dirty varmint."

38:13.583 --> 38:16.003
What did he do to make you
so mad, Bronco Billy?

38:16.211 --> 38:17.671
He talked dirty
about my mother.

38:18.046 --> 38:19.423
So you killed
one-eyed Charlie?

38:19.589 --> 38:20.589
Well, I didn't kill him,

38:20.590 --> 38:22.301
but I shot his holsters
right off his hips.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.736
You see, you should
never kill a man

38:23.760 --> 38:25.512
unless it's absolutely
necessary.

38:26.013 --> 38:27.973
May I speak with you
for a moment?

38:28.765 --> 38:30.767
Sure. See you
in a little bit.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.394
Thanks for the show,
Bronco Billy.

38:32.561 --> 38:33.561
You're welcome.

38:34.229 --> 38:37.357
You promised to take me
to the next town.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.902
Yeah... tell you
what I'll do.

38:41.486 --> 38:42.946
I'll take you
to the next town,

38:43.113 --> 38:44.448
and you work
the first show for me

38:44.614 --> 38:46.158
till I can get
a replacement.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.285
Then you're
on your own. Deal?

38:49.161 --> 38:50.161
Deal.

38:50.537 --> 38:51.788
Buster and I
come riding in

38:51.955 --> 38:53.582
after doc announces me.

38:53.749 --> 38:56.335
Then I ride around the arena
here, doing my tricks.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.546
When I announce you,
you'll come out over here,

38:59.921 --> 39:01.423
and you'll walk up
to this table.

39:01.965 --> 39:04.301
Then I'll nod my head,
and you pick up 2 plates.

39:04.718 --> 39:06.887
When I ride by, you throw up
the first plate...

39:07.971 --> 39:10.223
Count to 3, then throw up
the second plate.

39:10.390 --> 39:11.475
Got that?

39:12.392 --> 39:13.632
I'll show you
what it looks like

39:13.685 --> 39:15.354
when the plates go off.

39:19.566 --> 39:20.692
No problem.

39:21.151 --> 39:23.528
It takes hours of practice
to learn to do that.

39:29.076 --> 39:31.203
Mighty fine shootin',
Miss Lily.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.080
Beginner's luck.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.874
Where on earth did you
learn how to shoot like that?

39:36.333 --> 39:37.166
I was the...

39:37.167 --> 39:38.710
haven't you got something
better to do

39:38.877 --> 39:40.962
than hang around here
like a prairie dog in heat?

39:41.588 --> 39:44.341
As a matter of fact,
I do. Excellent.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.304
You don't do the shooting
around here. I do that.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.014
All right.

39:51.181 --> 39:53.308
Now pretend I've done
all my tricks.

39:54.851 --> 39:55.936
I'll come back.

39:56.603 --> 39:57.979
I get on buster...

40:00.107 --> 40:02.192
And we ride
around the arena.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.113
I'll come ridin'
around here,

40:07.364 --> 40:08.865
then I'll swing down
and pick you up.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.575
You can slide right on
back of me.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.076
You what?

40:12.077 --> 40:13.453
You reach your arm out,

40:13.620 --> 40:15.247
and I lift you right up
in back of me.

40:15.831 --> 40:17.290
And that's all
I have to do?

40:17.541 --> 40:18.917
That's all
you have to do.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.169
What happens
if I fall?

40:22.337 --> 40:23.212
Trust me.

40:23.213 --> 40:24.381
Trust?

40:24.506 --> 40:25.924
Look, if you can't
get it right,

40:26.091 --> 40:27.491
we'll just go
over and over it again

40:27.551 --> 40:28.760
until you do
get it right.

40:29.511 --> 40:30.512
No problem.

40:32.139 --> 40:33.473
All right.
Here I come.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.150
Aahh! Oh!

40:43.442 --> 40:44.651
No problem?

40:47.279 --> 40:48.112
Mr. Lipton.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.031
Hello, Eloise.
Mrs. Lily in?

40:50.198 --> 40:51.491
I'll tell her
you're here.

40:52.868 --> 40:54.137
Mr. Lipton is here
to see you, ma'am.

40:54.161 --> 40:56.872
Uh, thank you, dear.
Edgar, darling.

40:57.038 --> 40:58.540
The f.B.I.
Has just arrested

40:58.707 --> 41:00.333
John Arlington
in Arizona.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.043
What on earth was he
doing in Arizona?

41:02.210 --> 41:03.378
I have a strong
suspicion

41:03.587 --> 41:04.754
he was getting
ready to flee

41:04.880 --> 41:06.423
across
the Mexican border.

41:06.923 --> 41:07.923
He was wearing

41:07.924 --> 41:09.885
several of Antoinette's
diamond bracelets.

41:10.302 --> 41:12.137
They are formally
charging him

41:12.304 --> 41:14.139
with the murder
of your stepdaughter.

41:15.515 --> 41:17.184
I'm going out there
to see him.

41:17.601 --> 41:19.186
Has he...
has he confessed?

41:19.811 --> 41:21.229
Well, at the time
of his arrest,

41:21.396 --> 41:23.482
he was suffering
from amoebic dysentery

41:23.648 --> 41:25.692
and... wasn't
able to talk.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.403
As soon as
he confesses,

41:28.778 --> 41:30.155
I want you
to file a petition

41:30.572 --> 41:31.781
requesting me
to be named

41:31.990 --> 41:33.450
benefactor
of the estate.

41:33.617 --> 41:34.575
Of course.

41:34.576 --> 41:35.577
Eloise.

41:36.912 --> 41:37.912
Irene...

41:38.872 --> 41:40.957
I want to extend to you
my deepest sympathy

41:41.124 --> 41:42.542
in this hour
of tragedy.

41:43.293 --> 41:46.379
Oh! Oh, that is
sweet of you, Edgar.

41:56.264 --> 41:57.516
Just do what
I told you.

41:57.766 --> 41:58.767
Simple.

42:00.894 --> 42:02.145
Miss Lily...

42:02.938 --> 42:04.606
Would you like
a blindfold?

42:04.814 --> 42:06.566
Oh, no, Bronco Billy,

42:06.775 --> 42:07.775
for you most certainly

42:07.859 --> 42:10.362
are the finest marksman
in all the west.

42:14.366 --> 42:15.659
Very well...

42:17.244 --> 42:18.328
But I will
wear one.

42:18.537 --> 42:20.455
Must you,
Bronco Billy?

42:29.130 --> 42:30.924
Are you ready,
Miss Lily?

42:31.091 --> 42:32.676
Yes, Bronco Billy.

42:34.219 --> 42:35.887
All right,
spin the wheel.

42:39.933 --> 42:40.933
Aaahh!

42:42.185 --> 42:43.185
Aaahh!

42:50.068 --> 42:51.695
Aaahh!

43:17.053 --> 43:18.638
Next time
you change the dialog

43:18.805 --> 43:21.141
on that piece of paper
I gave you, you're fired!

43:21.308 --> 43:22.726
How dare you
come in here!

43:22.892 --> 43:23.972
Where's that
piece of paper?

43:24.060 --> 43:26.021
I'm not accustomed
to being yelled at.

43:26.229 --> 43:27.939
Where is that
piece of paper?

43:29.941 --> 43:31.318
There! Ooh!

43:32.736 --> 43:35.905
I say, "would you like
a blindfold, Miss Lily?"

43:36.072 --> 43:37.272
And you say,
"no, Bronco Billy,

43:37.407 --> 43:38.700
because you're
the best shot."

43:38.867 --> 43:40.327
Not the best marksman!

43:40.660 --> 43:42.037
And when I say,
"I'll use one,"

43:42.203 --> 43:44.372
where does it say,
"must you, Bronco Billy"?

43:44.539 --> 43:45.999
It doesn't say that
here, does it?

43:46.166 --> 43:47.208
No.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.502
Every assistant I've had
for the last 10 years

43:49.669 --> 43:51.421
has said exactly
what's on this paper,

43:51.671 --> 43:53.065
and that's the way
I want it continued!

43:53.089 --> 43:54.382
Do you understand?

43:54.799 --> 43:56.843
And another thing...
I own this tent.

43:57.010 --> 43:59.346
Are you finished
with your little speech?

43:59.512 --> 44:00.847
Yeah, I'm finished!

44:01.389 --> 44:03.516
I do not work for you,

44:03.683 --> 44:06.269
and if you ever raise
your voice to me again,

44:06.436 --> 44:08.480
I will scratch
out your eyes!

44:09.898 --> 44:10.898
<i>Billy?</i>

44:11.066 --> 44:13.234
Are we camping here
tonight or moving on?

44:14.986 --> 44:16.237
We're hittin'
the trail...

44:16.404 --> 44:17.404
Now!

44:18.406 --> 44:21.201
Oh, he is
a madman!

44:21.493 --> 44:22.493
Is he?

44:22.577 --> 44:23.577
Oh!

44:26.164 --> 44:28.917
John Arlington,
I am going to murder you

44:29.084 --> 44:30.627
for doing this to me.

44:31.294 --> 44:32.420
Oh!

44:34.631 --> 44:35.965
How's buster feeling?

44:37.092 --> 44:39.260
Oh, kind of
poorly, doc.

44:39.761 --> 44:42.681
Oh, it's just his arthritis
acting up again.

44:42.972 --> 44:44.052
I'll give him
a couple swigs

44:44.140 --> 44:45.684
of my snake bite remedy

44:45.850 --> 44:48.311
to fix the old boy up
just like new.

44:49.312 --> 44:51.606
One of these days,
we'll get that ranch.

44:51.940 --> 44:53.525
Old buster can go
out to pasture.

44:54.067 --> 44:55.147
Running water
was telling me

44:55.193 --> 44:57.570
about the run-in you had
with Miss Lily.

44:58.571 --> 45:01.866
I say good riddance
to that woman.

45:02.117 --> 45:03.493
She just couldn't
cut the bacon.

45:03.660 --> 45:04.845
I'm glad she got out
of the frying pan

45:04.869 --> 45:06.705
before I wasted
that much time on her.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.525
That's kind of a shame,
because...

45:08.665 --> 45:10.875
I thought she did pretty good
for her first show.

45:11.042 --> 45:12.252
She couldn't
take orders, doc.

45:12.419 --> 45:13.579
I gave her
the piece of paper,

45:13.712 --> 45:15.171
and she couldn't
memorize her words.

45:15.463 --> 45:17.799
But she was
a damned good shot.

45:20.677 --> 45:22.846
I don't want to talk
about her ever again.

45:23.555 --> 45:24.973
OK. You're the boss.

45:26.307 --> 45:27.851
She got her ride
to the next town

45:28.017 --> 45:29.894
and her breakfast
on the house.

45:31.521 --> 45:32.981
Mighty kind of you.

45:35.191 --> 45:36.818
Her kind don't
want to work.

45:40.280 --> 45:42.449
No wonder her husband
ran off and left her.

46:00.925 --> 46:02.385
Excuse me, miss.

46:14.647 --> 46:16.024
"Heiress murdered."

46:16.524 --> 46:18.276
Can I see
the sports section?

46:20.737 --> 46:21.988
You may.

46:22.197 --> 46:23.197
Thank you.

46:23.782 --> 46:24.866
Bye, ma'am.

46:27.202 --> 46:28.495
Goodbye, Miss Lily.

46:31.247 --> 46:33.541
It's too bad you can't
come along with us.

46:34.793 --> 46:36.503
So long.
Happy trails.

46:46.971 --> 46:48.890
<i>You have a visitor
from New York.</i>

46:52.894 --> 46:53.894
My wife?

46:57.565 --> 46:58.900
Hello, Edgar.

47:01.736 --> 47:03.071
<i>You have 5 minutes.</i>

47:03.238 --> 47:04.614
You're looking well.

47:06.950 --> 47:08.409
That's easy
for you to say.

47:08.576 --> 47:11.496
You don't have
amoebic dysentery.

47:11.663 --> 47:14.541
John...
I've known Antoinette...

47:15.333 --> 47:16.613
Since she was
just a little girl,

47:16.709 --> 47:17.709
and believe me,

47:17.836 --> 47:20.588
I don't blame you
for murdering her.

47:21.798 --> 47:25.468
But I didn't murder
that cold-blooded viper.

47:25.718 --> 47:26.803
The sooner you confess,

47:26.970 --> 47:28.888
the sooner
we can all benefit.

47:29.472 --> 47:30.347
Benefit?

47:30.348 --> 47:31.391
John, I know how much

47:31.558 --> 47:34.018
you must have loved her
to have done such a thing,

47:34.978 --> 47:37.438
but the living
must go on living.

47:37.605 --> 47:39.858
What has happened,
has happened.

47:40.358 --> 47:44.362
Edgar, I'm facing
the electric chair

47:44.696 --> 47:46.114
or something,

47:46.364 --> 47:47.842
and you're standing
here talking about,

47:47.866 --> 47:49.659
"the living must
go on living."

47:49.826 --> 47:54.956
I guarantee... That if you
plead temporary insanity,

47:55.415 --> 47:57.166
you won't spend
more than 3 years

47:57.333 --> 47:58.668
in a mental
institution.

47:59.002 --> 48:00.712
What are you
getting at?

48:00.962 --> 48:03.506
If you confess to
Antoinette's murder,

48:04.340 --> 48:07.510
the day you're released
from the institution,

48:07.760 --> 48:11.848
you will receive
half a million dollars.

48:20.398 --> 48:21.649
But it's...

48:23.151 --> 48:25.653
What if they
don't buy that,

48:25.820 --> 48:27.572
and I go to the electric
chair anyway...

48:27.739 --> 48:28.739
Or something?

48:28.781 --> 48:29.781
They'll buy it.

48:30.450 --> 48:33.036
I can arrange anything.
You know that.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.581
But those mental
institutions,

48:36.748 --> 48:38.333
they're supposed
to be maddening.

48:38.499 --> 48:40.168
I know of some
out here

48:40.335 --> 48:42.712
that have tennis courts
and swimming pools,

48:42.921 --> 48:44.422
your own
private room,

48:44.589 --> 48:47.550
color TV,
maid service.

48:50.178 --> 48:51.846
$500,000?

48:52.013 --> 48:53.013
Mm-hmm.

48:57.101 --> 48:59.103
How much is that
after taxes?

49:00.855 --> 49:02.732
Well, if you
invest wisely,

49:03.608 --> 49:05.318
you won't have
to pay a dime.

49:06.569 --> 49:07.737
Ohh.

49:08.780 --> 49:10.073
I didn't mean
to kill her,

49:10.239 --> 49:12.700
but she was
driving me crazy.

49:21.084 --> 49:22.210
What are you
doing here?

49:23.378 --> 49:25.254
Well, you still need
an assistant, don't you?

49:26.798 --> 49:29.300
I'm the head ramrod.
I give the orders.

49:31.803 --> 49:33.304
Yes, Bronco Billy.

49:34.389 --> 49:35.669
All right,
get out of this truck.

49:37.016 --> 49:39.394
Why? Aren't we headin'
down the old trail?

49:39.560 --> 49:41.360
First, you got to prove
that you can work hard

49:41.437 --> 49:42.939
before you ride
with the head ramrod.

49:43.106 --> 49:44.857
Oh, I do, do I?

49:45.191 --> 49:47.235
Do you want the job,
or don't you?

50:06.337 --> 50:10.258
Lefty... is that
your real name, Lefty?

50:11.467 --> 50:12.760
What's it to you?

50:14.429 --> 50:17.682
Well, I was just trying to
make time pass more quickly.

50:18.099 --> 50:20.893
Why do you want to make
time pass quickly for?

50:22.812 --> 50:24.731
Because I find life
rather boring.

50:24.897 --> 50:25.897
Don't you?

50:26.441 --> 50:27.441
Nope.

50:29.318 --> 50:33.031
Well, I can see we have
very little to talk about.

50:34.365 --> 50:35.825
I reckon not.

50:42.540 --> 50:43.583
Light me.

50:54.761 --> 50:55.761
Leonard,

50:55.762 --> 50:58.056
how long have you been
with Bronco Billy?

50:59.098 --> 51:00.808
It must be
going on 9 years.

51:00.975 --> 51:02.060
Oh, please.

51:04.187 --> 51:07.315
Did your father teach you
your little lasso tricks?

51:08.941 --> 51:10.359
My father
taught me nothing.

51:11.235 --> 51:13.321
My father gave me
nothing but whippings.

51:14.280 --> 51:16.074
Billy taught me
everything I know.

51:16.324 --> 51:17.575
He give me a home.

51:18.659 --> 51:20.119
That's very touching.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.708
I don't know where
you come from, Miss Lily,

51:27.668 --> 51:29.605
but I think they must not
have given you much love

51:29.629 --> 51:31.255
when you was
a little girl.

52:12.839 --> 52:14.090
Well, it's good
to be back.

52:14.382 --> 52:15.424
I'm hungry.

52:15.675 --> 52:16.550
You're always hungry.

52:16.551 --> 52:17.677
Let's get
the big tent set up

52:17.844 --> 52:19.470
before we put on
the feedbag.

52:22.598 --> 52:24.475
Well, what would you
like for me to do?

52:24.642 --> 52:25.642
You go help the boys.

52:26.477 --> 52:27.597
And what are
you going to do?

52:28.146 --> 52:29.814
I do the thinking
around here.

52:29.981 --> 52:31.440
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

52:35.403 --> 52:36.612
Hey, chief, uh...

52:37.113 --> 52:38.114
Oh, excuse me.

52:38.573 --> 52:39.949
Is everything
all fixed up?

52:40.700 --> 52:42.743
We still have some
patchwork to do on the tent.

52:43.077 --> 52:44.245
All right. Good.

52:44.620 --> 52:47.415
Um... look, I... I don't
want you to get bit

52:47.582 --> 52:48.958
by those rattlesnakes
anymore.

52:49.125 --> 52:50.435
Why don't you use
those gopher snakes?

52:50.459 --> 52:52.020
That's what I bought
the damn things for.

52:52.044 --> 52:53.087
<i>OK, Billy.</i>

52:53.462 --> 52:54.502
Tell him.
He'll understand.

52:54.630 --> 52:55.630
I hope so.

52:57.300 --> 52:58.300
Tell me what?

52:58.801 --> 52:59.801
Well...

53:00.469 --> 53:01.469
Uh...

53:01.470 --> 53:02.555
Come on,
spit it out.

53:02.722 --> 53:04.640
I mean, that's what I'm
here for, is to help.

53:05.266 --> 53:06.934
Running water's
going to have a baby.

53:11.439 --> 53:13.566
You mean I'm going
to be an uncle?

53:13.733 --> 53:14.608
You ain't mad?

53:14.609 --> 53:16.611
Mad? That's the best
news I've ever heard.

53:17.945 --> 53:19.322
I know money's tight.

53:19.989 --> 53:21.407
We got to get
ourselves a trailer.

53:21.574 --> 53:23.367
And we got to get
some clothes

53:23.534 --> 53:24.534
for the little pard.

53:24.660 --> 53:26.037
What's all
the shooting about?

53:26.495 --> 53:28.515
Big Eagle and Running Water
are going to have a baby.

53:28.539 --> 53:30.416
Congratulations!

53:35.630 --> 53:36.881
Why don't we
get into our duds,

53:37.048 --> 53:38.507
go into town,
and raise some hell?

Billy? Well,
I am really honored.

54:52.415 --> 54:55.418
In fact, we'll have
to give you a raise

54:55.584 --> 54:57.211
when the critter's
born.

54:57.378 --> 54:58.462
Thanks, boss.

54:58.713 --> 54:59.546
Here's a toast

54:59.547 --> 55:02.049
to the fastest gun
in the west, Bronco Billy.

55:02.550 --> 55:03.551
Bottoms up.

55:08.097 --> 55:10.141
Why don't you put some
fire between your legs

55:10.266 --> 55:11.475
and join in, huh?

55:13.185 --> 55:16.105
I've matched you
beer for beer all night.

55:17.690 --> 55:20.109
You're the coldest
fish I have ever met.

55:20.651 --> 55:22.653
How dare you
call me a fish!

55:23.195 --> 55:26.365
"How dare you..."
Well, you are, you know.

55:26.532 --> 55:27.992
You don't know
how to have fun.

55:28.159 --> 55:31.120
Ha! You call
your life fun?

55:31.287 --> 55:32.288
Dance.

55:32.830 --> 55:33.974
Your daddy
should have probably

55:33.998 --> 55:35.374
taken a belt
to your backside

55:35.499 --> 55:37.877
so you'd have
some respect.

55:39.045 --> 55:41.380
My father
was a great man.

55:42.423 --> 55:44.759
He went to heaven
when I was 9 years old.

55:45.343 --> 55:47.094
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.

55:48.846 --> 55:51.432
There's a whole wide world
you don't know about,

55:51.599 --> 55:53.517
Mr. Bronco Billy.

55:54.435 --> 55:57.355
Mr. Bronco Billy, I'm going
to introduce myself

55:57.521 --> 56:00.232
to some fine lady
at the bar.

56:07.031 --> 56:08.824
People are such idiots.

56:11.369 --> 56:13.788
Go ahead. Let the tears
fall in that beer.

56:15.331 --> 56:16.749
I'm not crying.

56:16.916 --> 56:18.167
<i>Nothing wrong
with crying.</i>

56:18.334 --> 56:21.337
The smoke in here
is hurting my eyes.

56:22.838 --> 56:24.191
Did you ever think
what it would be like

56:24.215 --> 56:25.966
to be nice to folks?

56:27.760 --> 56:30.096
Folks just
want to take.

56:31.263 --> 56:33.516
Girl, you sure
are mixed up.

56:35.684 --> 56:37.144
No, I'm not.

56:41.982 --> 56:44.443
Miss Lily, get up.

56:45.444 --> 56:46.444
Why?

56:46.570 --> 56:48.614
Because I want to dance
with you, that's why.

56:50.282 --> 56:51.283
Dance?

56:51.575 --> 56:52.701
Come on.

56:53.119 --> 56:55.287
Once you take
the first step or two,

56:55.454 --> 56:56.454
it's easy.

56:58.124 --> 57:00.876
♪ ♪ That this
honky-tonk heaven ♪ ♪

57:01.127 --> 57:04.547

57:05.214 --> 57:07.550

57:18.185 --> 57:20.896

57:26.902 --> 57:28.863
Boy, if you could
only shoot straight.

57:29.196 --> 57:30.196
Ha!

57:30.322 --> 57:33.117
I can outshoot you
any day of the week.

57:33.742 --> 57:35.077
You sure are pretty.

57:36.203 --> 57:39.748
I'll bet you say that to
all the girls, Bronco Billy.

57:42.001 --> 57:43.294
How dare you!

57:43.794 --> 57:45.546
Jeez, I only
kissed you.

57:46.589 --> 57:47.589
Watch it, lady.

57:47.631 --> 57:48.631
Hey, don't shove...

57:50.593 --> 57:51.635
come back here.

57:51.802 --> 57:53.179
That's it.

58:44.021 --> 58:45.272
You stay out of this.

58:45.439 --> 58:46.440
We're family.

58:46.607 --> 58:48.651
We fight together,
we stick together.

58:49.902 --> 58:50.945
<i>Oww!</i>

58:52.571 --> 58:54.411
On second thought, I think
I'll stick with you.

58:54.573 --> 58:55.573
Good idea.

59:09.547 --> 59:11.465
We're going to take
a 5-minute break.

59:12.424 --> 59:13.717
Don't go away.

59:25.062 --> 59:26.522
Hey, pretty thing.

59:26.897 --> 59:28.482
How about
a little old drink?

59:29.358 --> 59:30.818
Get lost.

59:42.580 --> 59:44.415
My friend back there...

59:44.582 --> 59:46.292
He asked if you
wanted a drink.

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:06.228
Hey! No, no, no, no.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:11.108
How about that little
old drink, honey, huh?

01:00:13.569 --> 01:00:14.945
Now, come on.

01:00:15.154 --> 01:00:16.280
We just want to...

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:20.576
We got us
a wildcat!

01:00:20.743 --> 01:00:22.244
Oh, have we ever.

01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:26.164
No!

01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:28.125
No!

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.042
Wait a minute, cowboy,
I've had enough.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:53.567
Like hell you have.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:06.829
Don't kill me!

01:01:06.914 --> 01:01:08.123
Killing's
too good for you.

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.677
You all right, Miss Lily?

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.053
Course she ain't.

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.305
I'll take her back
in the truck.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.585
The night is young,
and I'm young...

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:32.231
full of more fight than any
hombre west of the Pecos.

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:34.274
Come on, let's go back,
have some more fun.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:36.652
She'll be all right.

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.613
Running water
and I are going back.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:42.865
Lefty?

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:45.285
Kid, go kick up
a storm.

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:46.532
I ain't going
back in there.

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:07.433
Here.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.935
Sorry. Is it too hot?

01:02:12.688 --> 01:02:14.022
Are you OK?

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.443
I'm still shaking.

01:02:18.444 --> 01:02:20.988
Everybody gets scared
once in a while.

01:02:26.285 --> 01:02:27.619
Have you ever
been married?

01:02:29.121 --> 01:02:30.121
Sure.

01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:32.291
A long time ago.

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:35.043
Did you love her?

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:38.380
With all my heart.

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.716
Sometimes that
just isn't enough.

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.384
What happened?

01:02:44.011 --> 01:02:46.263
I caught her in bed
with my best friend.

01:02:48.724 --> 01:02:50.267
What did you
do to him?

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:51.935
I shot her.

01:02:52.728 --> 01:02:53.728
What?

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:55.522
What about him?

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:57.065
He was my best friend.

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.234
My god!

01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:02.613
Don't worry.
I didn't kill her.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:04.323
She was all right,

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:08.285
but I spent 7 years in Folsom
for attempted murder.

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:11.789
But I ain't
complaining.

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:14.958
I met a lot of
nice people there

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:19.004
like Doc Lynch
and Lefty LeBow...

01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:22.216
Big Eagle, who was doing
5 to 10 for armed robbery.

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:24.426
Oh, my god.
Convicts.

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:27.679
What did doc
and Lefty do?

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:29.806
Well, doc was in

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:31.892
for practicing medicine
without a license.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:34.812
Lefty was
a former bank teller

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.897
whose wife had
expensive habits.

01:03:37.815 --> 01:03:39.733
Said he was going to
give the money back.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:41.442
I believe him.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:45.072
None of you look
like convicts.

01:03:46.615 --> 01:03:48.033
We did our time.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:54.581
Are you for real?

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:58.877
I'm who I want to be.

01:04:11.974 --> 01:04:15.435
I've never been this close
to a convict before.

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:18.605
Sorry. Didn't
mean to say that.

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:20.274
I paid my price.

01:04:25.654 --> 01:04:26.864
Don't.

01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:29.992
That's all right.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:33.579
You'll know
when the time comes.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:01.898
Morning, doc.

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:03.734
The sheriff called
the front gate and told me

01:05:03.942 --> 01:05:06.320
he's got Leonard
locked up in his jail!

01:05:24.171 --> 01:05:26.089
Sheriff, you got
one of my wranglers

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.425
a-housed up
in your calaboose here.

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:33.722
Uh, what was his name?

01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:35.098
Leonard James.

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:38.560
You two waiting
to see me?

01:05:38.727 --> 01:05:39.728
They're with me, sheriff.

01:05:39.895 --> 01:05:41.772
I run the Bronco Billy
wild west show.

01:05:41.939 --> 01:05:44.232
In fact, we're playing over at
the fairgrounds tonight.

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:47.277
Yeah...
Well, let's see.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.906
James, Leonard,
age 28.

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:53.784
Drunk and disorderly
in a public place,

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:56.578
resisting arrest...

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:58.956
We kicked up
our heels last night.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.541
Maybe Leonard kicked
his up too high.

01:06:04.586 --> 01:06:08.298
We run a routine check
on your boy.

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:10.717
Found that he's wanted
for desertion

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:12.803
from the United States
army.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:18.641
Hmm...

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:21.269
You must have
the wrong man, sheriff.

01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:26.191
Prints don't lie.

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:29.027
Your boy's a coward.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.614
He didn't want
to fight in Vietnam.

01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:37.159
Can we see him?

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.119
Yeah.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.120
Uh...

01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:40.372
Just you.

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:42.749
You two can
wait outside.

01:06:49.423 --> 01:06:50.423
Hi, boss.

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:52.426
What in the hell did you
become a deserter for?

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:53.592
I got a show to run.

01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:54.821
Where am I going
to find a wrangler

01:06:54.845 --> 01:06:56.763
who can rope like you can
by showtime?

01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:58.472
Sorry, boss.

01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:00.142
I was just
a little kid then.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:03.729
You're really in trouble
this time, Leonard.

01:07:05.022 --> 01:07:08.150
Billy, do they still
shoot deserters?

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:10.986
It would teach
you a lesson if they did.

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:13.780
Imagine a deserter
with my show.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:15.717
What about
those little partners

01:07:15.741 --> 01:07:16.825
that look up to you?

01:07:16.992 --> 01:07:18.872
What are they going to think
when they find out?

01:07:20.454 --> 01:07:21.494
Couldn't you just
tell them

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.165
I died with my boots on?

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:27.586
What happened
to your eye?

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:30.005
Couple of deputies.

01:07:30.172 --> 01:07:32.132
When they found out
I was a deserter,

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:34.259
they took me
in the back room.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:43.268
Why didn't you
tell me about it?

01:07:44.478 --> 01:07:46.605
I was on the run
9 years ago.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.357
You took me in.
You gave me a home.

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:52.736
I couldn't just let you
stand out in the rain.

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:54.905
I didn't want you to get
involved with it.

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:04.164
Looks like it's the end
of the trail now.

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:06.166
You take care.

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.633
You just can't
leave him here.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.094
If he's a deserter,
he deserves what he gets.

01:08:20.346 --> 01:08:21.221
I don't believe

01:08:21.223 --> 01:08:23.100
Billy's just going
to let him rot in jail.

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:24.850
What can he do?

01:08:25.102 --> 01:08:27.687
The army's too powerful,
even for Bronco Billy.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:31.191
It's not like him to leave
a friend in jail like that.

01:08:31.358 --> 01:08:34.361
Desertion is
a tough charge to beat.

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:38.615
What if you have an attorney
to defend Leonard?

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:42.327
Attorney? Miss Lily,
attorney costs money,

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:45.287
and that's one luxury
we ain't never had.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:10.397
Billy,
where you going?

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:11.814
Get ready
for the show.

01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:45.807
I appreciate you
coming out here

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:48.225
and meeting me
like this, sheriff.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.564
It was a rather
interesting phone call.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:01.156
I figure if my man's
sent up for desertion,

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:05.368
there ain't no profit
in that for any of us.

01:10:07.746 --> 01:10:10.790
What kind of profit
are we talking about?

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:14.836
$500?

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:19.257
Hey!

01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:23.511
Just how fast are you
with that pea-shooter?

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:26.847
Fast enough.

01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:29.100
I'm pretty fast myself.

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:35.148
You know, $500
isn't very much money

01:10:35.315 --> 01:10:37.400
for me to take
such a big risk.

01:10:40.195 --> 01:10:43.865
All right.
This is all I have.

01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:45.325
This comes to $1,100.

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:46.743
It's all I've got
in the world.

01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:48.203
Is that so?

01:10:49.788 --> 01:10:52.499
You think you're
faster than I am?

01:10:55.502 --> 01:10:57.671
I wouldn't want to
find that out, sheriff.

01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:00.882
Aren't you Bronco Billy,
the fastest in the west?

01:11:01.967 --> 01:11:05.929
The roughest, toughest hombre
this side of dodge city?

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:10.183
Look, I'm just making
a living like everyone else.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:11.393
Shit.

01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:15.397
I can outdraw you
any day in the week.

01:11:17.649 --> 01:11:18.858
Couldn't I?

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:22.736
I reckon.

01:11:22.737 --> 01:11:23.780
<i>Reckon?</i>

01:11:25.115 --> 01:11:26.866
Let me hear
you say it.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:29.953
Or do you want to find out
how fast I really am?

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:32.831
Wanna go at it?

01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:34.958
Hmm?

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:39.337
You want
to get with it, boy?

01:11:43.008 --> 01:11:44.301
Or are you a coward

01:11:44.426 --> 01:11:46.845
like that deserter
friend of yours?

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:54.227
You're faster
than I am.

01:11:54.352 --> 01:11:55.395
What'd you say?

01:11:55.562 --> 01:11:57.897
I said you're faster
than I am.

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:06.406
All right.

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.575
Just take out that gun
nice and easy

01:12:08.742 --> 01:12:11.202
and throw it right there
on the ground.

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:36.519
Yeah.

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:43.193
Bronco Billy...

01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:49.491
You're nothing but
a yellow-bellied egg-sucker.

01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:57.832
Peanuts!

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:00.001
Coca-Cola!

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:06.966
Here you go.

01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:09.010
2? All righty.

01:13:09.177 --> 01:13:10.178
Have you seen the boss?

01:13:10.345 --> 01:13:12.055
Nope. He hasn't
shown up yet.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.557
10 minutes
till showtime.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:17.185
It's the first full house
since dodge city.

01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:20.146
Step right in, folks.

01:13:20.814 --> 01:13:22.524
Someone will take
your ticket inside.

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:24.108
Any sign of Billy?

01:13:24.234 --> 01:13:25.192
Oh, he'll show up.

01:13:25.193 --> 01:13:26.319
What if he doesn't?

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.405
Then you'll do the longest
rattlesnake dance

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:29.488
of your life.

01:13:29.489 --> 01:13:30.489
He'll show up.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.076
I've sold everything
except the empty box.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:34.744
Any sign of Bronco Billy?

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.704
Never known Bronco Billy
to miss a show.

01:13:37.372 --> 01:13:38.748
He's not
on the midway.

01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:42.627
In that case, I suggest
we put on the show.

01:13:44.963 --> 01:13:47.340
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:13:47.507 --> 01:13:49.509
We welcome you
this evening

01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:52.512
to the greatest,
the most authentic

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:55.640
wild west show
in America!

01:13:56.266 --> 01:13:58.143
Guess I better
change my costume.

01:13:59.352 --> 01:14:00.645
She brought us
bad luck.

01:14:00.812 --> 01:14:01.770
Don't talk that way.

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:02.646
It's true.

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:03.480
It ain't.

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:06.860
Will perform his legendary
rattlesnake dance

01:14:07.026 --> 01:14:09.404
that no white man
has ever seen!

01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:11.823
And that's exactly
what I mean!

01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:14.242
Chief Big Eagle!

01:14:19.706 --> 01:14:22.250
Eeee-wah!

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.786
We want Billy!

01:14:58.953 --> 01:15:00.622
We want Billy!

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:02.624
We want Billy!

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:04.501
We want Billy!

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:06.085
We want Billy!

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.223
Bronco Billy.

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:20.058
Get inside, woman.
We got a show to do.

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:22.393
Leonard,
you're hurt.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.230
Those yahoos couldn't hurt
lasso Leonard James.

01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:27.190
Quit chewin' the cud.
Get goin'.

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:33.738
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.242
Please, folks!

01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:39.118
<i>Keep your seats!</i>

01:15:41.913 --> 01:15:43.498
<i>Bronco Billy
will be here!</i>

01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:45.667
<i>He'll be here!
The show's going on!</i>

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:48.711
All right, calm down. Slow
it down. Take it easy, now.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:49.878
Come on, kid.

01:15:49.963 --> 01:15:51.965
Don't worry about it.
It's no bother to you.

01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:01.182
<i>Don't panic, folks!</i>

01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:03.476
<i>The show's going
to go on!</i>

01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:06.229
How did he
get you out of jail?

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:08.523
He can do anything.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.900
The tent's on fire!

01:16:11.693 --> 01:16:12.693
The tent's
on fire!

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:14.821
The tent's
on fire!

01:16:23.663 --> 01:16:25.623
Take it easy,
little buckaroos!

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:28.126
<i>Walk out of here.
Don't run.</i>

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:32.672
You're all right.
Don't worry.

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:35.091
Take it easy.

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:37.802
<i>Walk those little
partners out.</i>

01:16:37.969 --> 01:16:39.470
Slow it down.
There's plenty of time.

01:17:00.408 --> 01:17:03.202
Chief, give me a hand
with these posters.

01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:09.708
Whoa!

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:20.720
- I got it.
- Get the other side.

01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:15.900
Thank the lord
nobody got hurt.

01:18:16.484 --> 01:18:17.484
Yeah.

01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:19.946
It's Miss Lily's
fault.

01:18:20.113 --> 01:18:21.364
She brought us
bad luck.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.199
<i>It is.</i>

01:18:59.277 --> 01:19:00.877
Boy, the sooner
the boss gets rid of her,

01:19:00.945 --> 01:19:02.488
the sooner our luck
is going to change.

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:04.282
Miss Lily did not
start that fire.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:05.783
She's bad luck,
I tell you.

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:08.453
Honey, Lefty's right.
She's bad luck.

01:19:11.456 --> 01:19:13.124
Hiya, king.
Get you some coffee?

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:14.667
Thank you,
Running Water.

01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:18.045
Well, lady luck
sure didn't shine

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:19.380
on you boys this time.

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:21.299
You can say
that again.

01:19:21.799 --> 01:19:22.842
Good morning,
king.

01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:25.887
Billy... what's your plans?

01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:27.430
I don't know.

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:30.600
The sun's always shining
over the next valley.

01:19:30.767 --> 01:19:33.019
Maybe that's where
we'll find our pot of gold.

01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:34.854
Well, um...

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:37.940
We took up a little
collection along the midway.

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:39.108
It ain't a lot,

01:19:39.901 --> 01:19:41.569
but it'll
help you start.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.863
Help you get back
on your feet.

01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:47.992
That's nice.

01:19:49.577 --> 01:19:50.577
Thanks.

01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:54.290
Appreciate it if you'd...

01:19:55.166 --> 01:19:56.918
Thank the rest of them
for us, too.

01:19:57.084 --> 01:19:58.503
We're pulling out
this morning.

01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:00.004
Sure thing.

01:20:02.924 --> 01:20:04.258
Let's get out of here.

01:20:13.768 --> 01:20:14.768
Howdy.

01:21:03.276 --> 01:21:05.987
Damn! It's all my fault
the tent burned down.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.489
If I hadn't got thrown
in the calaboose,

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:11.158
Billy would have
been there and stopped it.

01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:12.660
Boy, are you blind?

01:21:12.869 --> 01:21:15.288
Since she's been with us,
our luck's gone rotten.

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:17.456
You're mean.

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:20.334
You just a mean old
ornery cuss,

01:21:20.501 --> 01:21:21.711
and you don't like nobody.

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:40.938
Don't you just love
these wide open spaces

01:21:41.105 --> 01:21:42.815
where the deer
and the antelope roam?

01:21:43.733 --> 01:21:46.152
Boss, the boys want me
to talk to you.

01:21:46.319 --> 01:21:49.238
Doc, tell the boys nobody's
going to get laid off.

01:21:49.697 --> 01:21:50.757
We're going
to pull on our belts

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:51.866
and pull up our boots.

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:53.635
We'll see this thing
through together.

01:21:53.659 --> 01:21:55.161
We've been through
worse than this.

01:21:55.328 --> 01:21:56.996
I'm sure they'll be
glad to hear that.

01:21:57.163 --> 01:21:58.331
I know I am.

01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:00.750
But, well, uh...

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:02.668
You got a chicken bone
in your throat?

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:04.754
It's the boys.

01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:06.589
They want you
to get rid of Miss Lily.

01:22:06.881 --> 01:22:08.424
They think
she's bad luck.

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:10.777
Who the hell
do they think they are,

01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:11.760
telling me what to do?

01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:13.012
It's my show!

01:22:13.179 --> 01:22:14.699
I do the hiring
and firing around here.

01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:18.017
Anybody don't like it,
they can get out.

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:20.561
Well, things
ain't been so good

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:22.104
since she joined us.

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:25.650
I know, but that poor little
gal's been through hell.

01:22:27.193 --> 01:22:29.570
Aw, heck, I didn't like her
myself at the beginning,

01:22:29.737 --> 01:22:32.406
but she's coming around
to my way of thinking now.

01:22:33.199 --> 01:22:35.117
What we gonna do?

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.578
We can't put on no show
without a big tent.

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:39.871
I know that.

01:22:40.498 --> 01:22:42.458
What should I
tell the boys?

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:47.505
Tell them we're going
to Rob a train.

01:22:47.672 --> 01:22:49.006
OK, Billy.

01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:54.178
Rob a train?

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:02.269
How are we going
to stop a train?

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:04.063
Stopping a train is easy.

01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:06.691
Carting off all that money
is the hard part.

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:10.319
No outfit's robbed
a train in 90 years.

01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:12.321
They're smart,
that's why.

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:14.115
You people are crazy!

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:16.367
You could all go to jail
for the rest of your lives

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:17.952
for robbing a train.

01:23:18.119 --> 01:23:20.121
Appreciate your concern,
Miss Lily,

01:23:20.413 --> 01:23:22.540
and you may be right
about us being crazy.

01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:25.167
We're at the end
of our rope.

01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:27.795
This is not a game.

01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:29.213
People could get hurt.

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:31.382
We figure on nobody
getting hurt.

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:34.593
You don't even know
if it's the right train.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.387
You want out?
Just say so.

01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:38.347
You're all going
to get caught.

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:40.307
I say
Miss Lily's out.

01:23:40.808 --> 01:23:43.102
You're living
in a dream world.

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:46.188
There are no more
cowboys and Indians.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:47.773
That's in the past.

01:23:50.109 --> 01:23:54.071
Miss Lily, I was raised
in a one-room tenement

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:55.448
in New Jersey.

01:23:55.614 --> 01:23:57.408
As a kid, I never even
saw a cowboy,

01:23:57.575 --> 01:23:59.702
much less
the wide-open spaces,

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:03.497
except when I could scrounge up
a quarter for a picture show.

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:07.918
I was a shoe salesman
until I was 31 years old.

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:11.464
Deep down, I always
wanted to be a cowboy.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:14.842
One day, I laid
down my shoehorn

01:24:15.718 --> 01:24:18.054
and swore I'd never
live in the city again.

01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:20.473
You only live once.

01:24:21.432 --> 01:24:23.100
You got to give it
your best shot.

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:25.811
Don't do it,
Billy.

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.021
I'll give you
the money.

01:24:30.316 --> 01:24:31.356
That would be
a neat trick,

01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:32.602
considering
I haven't paid you

01:24:32.735 --> 01:24:34.153
since you started
working for me.

01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:37.031
I have money,
lots of it.

01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:40.117
If you say you do,
I believe you.

01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:43.120
But I'm head ramrod here,
and I've made my decision.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:02.640
All right, you all know what
you have to do. Get ready.

01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:04.350
Wait for me!

01:26:10.416 --> 01:26:11.876
Cowboys and Indians.

01:26:12.459 --> 01:26:13.711
Of course, dear.

01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:46.577
Billy, where are we?

01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:50.623
I've got an idea to
get us back in business.

01:26:50.998 --> 01:26:52.458
What is this place?

01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:54.543
A home for
the criminally insane.

01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:57.171
They should
love your act.

01:27:11.936 --> 01:27:13.771
Bronco Billy.

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:16.857
Dr. Canterbury,
you look spright.

01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:19.693
This is Miss Lily.
Remember doc?

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.195
My friend
and colleague.

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:25.449
Get back to work,
you nut.

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:27.409
I'm not nuts.

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:31.330
I'd like to see
Dr. Canterbury.

01:27:31.497 --> 01:27:33.582
How would you like a trip
to the yellow room?

01:27:40.005 --> 01:27:41.966
Can I talk with you
a moment?

01:27:42.132 --> 01:27:43.300
I need a favor
badly.

01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:46.387
Well, sure.
I'm a good listener.

01:27:46.553 --> 01:27:47.805
I'll be
right back.

01:27:51.684 --> 01:27:53.560
Billy, my considered
diagnosis is

01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:55.163
you have the worst
ailment known to man...

01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:56.187
no money.

01:27:56.397 --> 01:27:57.439
How can I help?

01:27:57.898 --> 01:28:01.527
How can my staff and
my patients best serve you?

01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:05.864
Well, doc, I know you have a giant sewing
room and your patients sew American flags

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:07.241
for the military.

01:28:07.408 --> 01:28:09.702
If it's a flag you want,
by all means, you've got one.

01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:11.745
It's a tent
that I need.

01:28:11.912 --> 01:28:13.272
Without it, I'm afraid
it's the end

01:28:13.372 --> 01:28:14.790
of the Bronco Billy
wild west show.

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:19.253
Billy, you all
have come here

01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:22.131
year in, year out,
always a free show.

01:28:22.923 --> 01:28:25.843
I don't know why,
but you do come.

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:28.762
After all
you've done for us,

01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:32.474
it would be a pleasure
to do this for you,

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.185
but I have a price.

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:36.854
You name it.

01:28:37.021 --> 01:28:39.648
I want you to teach me
how to twirl a six-shooter.

01:28:39.857 --> 01:28:41.191
You got that, old pard.

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:42.609
All right.

01:28:42.776 --> 01:28:45.279
You and your gang can
hole up in the guest wing.

01:28:45.446 --> 01:28:47.239
Come in. And you can
take your meals

01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:48.824
with the staff
or the patients,

01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:51.076
whichever you feel
most comfortable with.

01:28:52.953 --> 01:28:54.193
This place gives me
the creepers

01:28:54.330 --> 01:28:55.789
every time we come here.

01:28:55.998 --> 01:28:57.207
Some of these
people in there

01:28:57.374 --> 01:28:58.584
are just as sane
as you or I.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.211
That ain't
saying much.

01:29:01.545 --> 01:29:03.964
They just had
tough breaks.

01:29:04.131 --> 01:29:06.550
They were born sane
in a crazy world.

01:29:08.218 --> 01:29:10.346
Get your gear, buckaroos.
We're back in business.

01:29:10.471 --> 01:29:11.805
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:29:16.185 --> 01:29:17.978
Billy, how long
we got to stay here?

01:29:18.145 --> 01:29:19.813
As long as it takes
to get the tent made.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.180
How long is that
going to take?

01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:23.710
Look, Leonard, if you've got
something better to do, do it.

01:29:23.734 --> 01:29:25.069
Just asking, boss.
Just asking.

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:26.235
This is the Rose room...

01:29:26.362 --> 01:29:29.031
2 single beds and
a black and white TV.

01:29:29.198 --> 01:29:30.657
Lefty, Leonard.

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:33.660
Why is this called
the Rose room?

01:29:33.827 --> 01:29:35.788
It's always been
called the Rose room.

01:29:35.954 --> 01:29:37.915
<i>At least the rates
are reasonable.</i>

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:39.625
This is
the carnation room.

01:29:39.792 --> 01:29:41.293
It has a single bed
and a radio.

01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:43.212
I have
returned home.

01:29:44.463 --> 01:29:46.965
This is one of
our most requested rooms

01:29:47.132 --> 01:29:49.885
by guests who
frequently come here.

01:29:50.427 --> 01:29:52.596
By the way, you are
the first 2 Indians

01:29:52.763 --> 01:29:54.681
ever to be allowed to
stay in the guest wing.

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:55.950
What's the name
of this room?

01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:57.184
It doesn't have one.

01:29:58.310 --> 01:30:00.312
We call this our
honeymoon room.

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:02.314
You can't
be serious.

01:30:02.481 --> 01:30:04.274
Dr. Canterbury
specifically ordered me

01:30:04.441 --> 01:30:05.877
to put you and your wife
in this room.

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:06.818
Wife?

01:30:06.819 --> 01:30:08.362
Come, my dear.

01:30:11.198 --> 01:30:13.200
I forgot to tell them
about the view.

01:30:15.077 --> 01:30:16.078
Aah!

01:30:16.203 --> 01:30:17.203
Yahoo...

01:30:17.204 --> 01:30:18.872
Everything's
coming up roses.

01:30:19.039 --> 01:30:20.039
Come on over here

01:30:20.165 --> 01:30:22.459
and give Bronco Billy
a big kiss.

01:30:23.127 --> 01:30:26.088
Don't you find anything
about your life bizarre?

01:30:26.255 --> 01:30:28.006
The only thing
strange I find

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:29.692
is that you and I
haven't made love yet.

01:30:29.716 --> 01:30:31.176
Oh, let go of me!

01:30:31.343 --> 01:30:33.011
I'm crazy about you,
Miss Lily. Kiss me.

01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:36.390
You're as nutty as
the fruitcakes in this place.

01:30:36.557 --> 01:30:37.683
You love me,
don't you?

01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:40.477
I find your timing
less than appropriate.

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:42.646
Is it that time
of the month?

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:45.649
No, it is not
that time of the month!

01:30:45.816 --> 01:30:46.859
Well, kiss me, then.

01:30:47.025 --> 01:30:48.025
Oh!

01:30:48.444 --> 01:30:50.070
Leave me alone!

01:30:50.404 --> 01:30:52.030
All you
ever think about!

01:30:53.699 --> 01:30:55.409
You said I'd know
when the time is right,

01:30:55.576 --> 01:30:57.411
and, well,
I don't know it yet.

01:30:58.245 --> 01:31:00.873
There must be 13-year-olds
more woman than you are.

01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:04.001
At least I'm not
a phony cowboy

01:31:04.168 --> 01:31:05.836
from New Jersey.

01:31:17.306 --> 01:31:21.018
What's it take to melt
that heart of stone of yours?

01:31:32.613 --> 01:31:33.780
I'd like to see
the boss.

01:31:34.364 --> 01:31:35.449
He's not here.

01:31:35.616 --> 01:31:37.510
When you see him, tell him
I want to talk to him.

01:31:37.534 --> 01:31:38.534
Yes.

01:31:38.827 --> 01:31:41.580
Running water,
do you have a moment?

01:31:41.747 --> 01:31:42.747
Sure.

01:31:47.044 --> 01:31:48.587
So this is
the honeymoon room.

01:31:49.963 --> 01:31:51.048
Not much
of a honeymoon.

01:31:52.633 --> 01:31:54.927
Why does that man
make me so angry

01:31:55.093 --> 01:31:56.093
every time
we're together?

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:57.679
The boss is a funny guy.

01:31:58.263 --> 01:32:00.766
He's like all men...
a big kid in a man's body.

01:32:01.225 --> 01:32:02.851
Why do I hate him so?

01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:04.686
The Apaches have
a word for that.

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:05.896
It's called love.

01:32:08.315 --> 01:32:10.567
That's what the Apaches
call what I have?

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:12.945
When I first
met Big Eagle,

01:32:14.488 --> 01:32:16.198
I hated his guts.

01:32:16.365 --> 01:32:18.367
He was so dedicated
to preserving

01:32:18.534 --> 01:32:20.410
the heritage
of his ancestors.

01:32:20.577 --> 01:32:22.162
I felt rejected.

01:32:22.329 --> 01:32:24.206
At night when
everyone else is asleep,

01:32:24.373 --> 01:32:25.958
he's up working on
his book.

01:32:27.334 --> 01:32:28.752
Big Eagle
is a writer?

01:32:28.919 --> 01:32:30.359
He hasn't had anything
published yet,

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.421
but he's written 3 books.

01:32:31.588 --> 01:32:32.588
Oh, my god.

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:34.591
Big Eagle is a writer,

01:32:34.758 --> 01:32:36.969
Leonard
a Vietnam war deserter,

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:38.845
Lefty a bank teller,

01:32:39.012 --> 01:32:40.264
doc a doc,

01:32:41.557 --> 01:32:44.393
and Billy a shoe salesman
from New Jersey.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.311
- He told you that?
- Yes.

01:32:46.478 --> 01:32:48.564
You're the first assistant
he's ever told that.

01:32:49.565 --> 01:32:51.358
But we're so different.

01:32:51.692 --> 01:32:54.069
I hate to tell you
what I come from,

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.531
but I sure am not
an Indian by blood.

01:32:57.906 --> 01:32:59.324
I am Big Eagle's squaw,

01:32:59.491 --> 01:33:00.931
and that makes me
an Indian at heart.

01:33:02.035 --> 01:33:03.579
Don't you understand
what Bronco Billy

01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:05.289
and the wild west show
are all about?

01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:08.041
<i>You can be
anything you want.</i>

01:33:08.875 --> 01:33:10.919
All you have to do
is go out and become it.

01:33:16.008 --> 01:33:18.594
I didn't mean to bring
bad luck to the show.

01:33:19.595 --> 01:33:20.846
You didn't.

01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:23.307
What am I going to do?

01:33:23.557 --> 01:33:25.142
I can't tell you that,

01:33:25.392 --> 01:33:27.811
but I do know you're
running away from yourself,

01:33:28.186 --> 01:33:30.063
and until you know
who you want to be,

01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:32.441
<i>you're never
going to get very far.</i>

01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:28.750
Bronco Billy, I want you
to take me in your arms

01:34:28.914 --> 01:34:29.914
and make love to me.

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:34.503
Well, I would, Miss Lily,

01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:37.214
but unless you love me,
it wouldn't be any good.

01:34:39.049 --> 01:34:40.842
I love you,
Bronco Billy.

01:34:43.804 --> 01:34:45.764
Hey... take it easy.

01:34:46.598 --> 01:34:47.724
Take it easy.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:49.309
We got the rest
of the night...

01:34:49.851 --> 01:34:52.854
The rest of our lives
to enjoy each other.

01:36:12.017 --> 01:36:13.143
Antoinette?

01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:19.106
Antoinette?

In 2 days, you'll

01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:15.288
Could I say a few words
to your patients here?

01:37:16.623 --> 01:37:17.916
Certainly.

01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:22.504
Uh... uh... folks.

01:37:23.046 --> 01:37:26.466
I'd like to thank you
from the bottom of my heart

01:37:26.633 --> 01:37:28.051
for the great work
you're doing

01:37:28.218 --> 01:37:29.427
for me and my outfit.

01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:34.182
3 cheers for
Bronco Billy.

01:37:34.474 --> 01:37:35.851
Hip hip hooray!

01:37:36.101 --> 01:37:37.602
<i>Hip hip hooray!</i>

01:37:37.769 --> 01:37:40.021
Hip hip hooray.

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:50.031
Ah, good morning, Lefty.

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:51.324
What's so good about it?

01:37:51.658 --> 01:37:53.159
Mmm, smell that
fresh morning air.

01:37:53.326 --> 01:37:54.744
Look at
the blue sky above.

01:37:54.911 --> 01:37:56.830
You been drinking
doc's snakebite?

01:37:57.205 --> 01:37:59.833
I know you think
I've brought bad luck.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.043
I'll shoot straight,
Miss Lily. You have.

01:38:02.586 --> 01:38:03.920
Maybe I have,

01:38:04.087 --> 01:38:06.298
and I've been hard
to get along with,

01:38:06.548 --> 01:38:07.966
but I'd like
to change.

01:38:08.133 --> 01:38:09.885
I want to be part
of the outfit.

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:12.220
Won't you give me
a second chance?

01:38:12.387 --> 01:38:14.055
One rotten apple
can spoil the barrel.

01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:17.559
I've been like
a scared calf in a herd.

01:38:18.268 --> 01:38:20.353
A man's got to prove
himself on the range.

01:38:20.562 --> 01:38:21.938
That holds
for a woman.

01:38:22.689 --> 01:38:25.150
Could we have a cup
of coffee, Mr. LeBow?

01:38:26.318 --> 01:38:27.986
You got
a calling for it.

01:38:33.033 --> 01:38:34.451
Practice one hour
in the morning

01:38:34.618 --> 01:38:35.702
and one hour in
the evening,

01:38:35.869 --> 01:38:37.579
and you'll grow up
to be like Bronco Billy.

01:38:37.746 --> 01:38:38.746
I will.

01:38:39.623 --> 01:38:40.999
Howdy, old pard.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.627
Please come in,
Mr. Atherton.

01:38:45.921 --> 01:38:47.130
Arlington.

01:38:51.009 --> 01:38:52.093
Sit down, please.

01:38:54.304 --> 01:38:57.140
I like to hold
these informal sessions

01:38:57.307 --> 01:38:59.059
with all
the new patients

01:39:00.143 --> 01:39:02.270
so I can get to know
their problems.

01:39:04.230 --> 01:39:08.276
As you know, I have
been sent here for life

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:09.444
for murdering my wife,

01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:11.237
but I was framed.

01:39:12.197 --> 01:39:14.366
<i>My wife is the woman</i>

01:39:14.532 --> 01:39:17.202
in Bronco Billy's
wild west show.

01:39:17.369 --> 01:39:18.995
I know. I've seen her.

01:39:19.162 --> 01:39:21.081
You've got
to believe me.

01:39:24.793 --> 01:39:26.503
Why don't you start
at the beginning?

01:39:26.670 --> 01:39:28.129
Tell me all about it.

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:30.966
Well...

01:39:32.258 --> 01:39:33.885
Her stepmother's lawyer

01:39:34.052 --> 01:39:36.304
offered me $500,000

01:39:36.471 --> 01:39:39.015
if I would confess
to the murder.

01:39:39.516 --> 01:39:41.810
How was I last night,
Bronco Billy?

01:39:42.394 --> 01:39:44.396
Well,
we weren't performing.

01:39:44.562 --> 01:39:46.189
That's not what I meant.

01:39:46.773 --> 01:39:48.108
You did just great.

01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:49.650
I did?

01:39:49.818 --> 01:39:51.277
Yeah.
You know why?

01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:53.154
Because
you're a cowboy?

01:39:54.406 --> 01:39:56.408
I could've been a sailor
or a lumberjack

01:39:56.574 --> 01:39:58.368
or the president.

01:39:58.535 --> 01:40:00.704
We felt that good
because we love each other.

01:40:01.413 --> 01:40:03.164
The Apaches
have a word for it.

01:40:03.331 --> 01:40:04.164
They do?

01:40:04.165 --> 01:40:05.165
Yep.

01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:07.669
Oh, my god. I'm even
beginning to talk like you.

01:40:07.836 --> 01:40:09.254
You're becoming
a cowgirl?

01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:13.091
I'm a rootin' tootin' cowgirl
from the Rio Grande.

01:40:13.258 --> 01:40:14.509
You know, I've been thinking.

01:40:15.093 --> 01:40:17.679
With just a little time, I think
I could teach you to draw

01:40:17.846 --> 01:40:19.597
and twirl a gun,
shoot.

01:40:20.849 --> 01:40:23.101
Takes hours of practice
to learn that.

01:40:23.601 --> 01:40:24.602
No problem.

01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:27.772
Whatever you say,
Bronco Billy.

01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:31.443
Excuse me, Billy.

01:40:31.609 --> 01:40:33.111
Could I have
a moment of your time...

01:40:33.278 --> 01:40:34.571
also, the young lady's?

01:40:34.904 --> 01:40:35.904
Shoot, doc.

01:40:35.989 --> 01:40:36.990
<i>Antoinette!</i>

01:40:37.157 --> 01:40:38.700
It's me,
John Arlington!

01:40:38.867 --> 01:40:40.785
Tell them
you're alive!

01:40:40.952 --> 01:40:42.370
Back off, stranger.

01:40:42.537 --> 01:40:44.873
Control yourself,
Mr. Arlington.

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.875
Excuse me, ma'am,
but, uh,

01:40:47.167 --> 01:40:49.669
Mr. Arlington believes
you to be his wife.

01:40:49.836 --> 01:40:52.255
Whenever a patient
hallucinates,

01:40:52.422 --> 01:40:54.049
I confront them
with the facts of life.

01:40:54.215 --> 01:40:56.468
What on earth
are you doing here?

01:40:56.634 --> 01:40:58.136
I was framed!

01:40:58.303 --> 01:41:00.722
He really
is your husband?

01:41:00.889 --> 01:41:02.348
What'd you run off
and leave her for?

01:41:03.349 --> 01:41:06.144
If you knew her,
you'd run off, too.

01:41:06.311 --> 01:41:07.979
You really are
Antoinette Lily?

01:41:08.146 --> 01:41:09.439
Well, who else
would she be?

01:41:09.606 --> 01:41:11.941
Would somebody tell me
what's going on here?

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.402
I'm afraid I must call
the authorities.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.074
I'm so glad
you're alive

01:41:19.449 --> 01:41:21.034
because I'm
going to sue you

01:41:21.201 --> 01:41:22.285
and your stepmother

01:41:22.452 --> 01:41:25.288
and your crooked lawyer
for all you've got!

01:41:25.455 --> 01:41:27.582
What the hell's
going on here?

01:41:27.749 --> 01:41:29.167
She's my wife!

01:41:36.299 --> 01:41:38.259
I was just beginning
to like her.

01:41:38.968 --> 01:41:40.595
They look like
a buffalo herd.

01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:44.682
Are you people
patients here?

01:41:45.642 --> 01:41:47.227
How long have
you been here?

01:41:47.477 --> 01:41:49.938
Can you say anything
about John Arlington?

01:41:51.272 --> 01:41:53.233
Didn't you know
the entire country thought

01:41:53.399 --> 01:41:54.399
you had been murdered?

01:41:54.734 --> 01:41:56.653
I never read
newspapers.

01:41:57.570 --> 01:41:59.364
This man,
your husband,

01:41:59.656 --> 01:42:01.008
has been convicted
of murdering you.

01:42:01.032 --> 01:42:02.283
Now you
show up alive.

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:03.594
I mean, I just don't know
what to make of it.

01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:05.787
I find it a small
misunderstanding.

01:42:05.954 --> 01:42:08.456
Maybe you
and I do,

01:42:08.706 --> 01:42:11.167
but I doubt
the FBI will.

01:42:11.668 --> 01:42:12.710
The FBI?

01:42:14.129 --> 01:42:15.213
They'll be
here tonight

01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:19.300
to transport you and McCoy
back to New York City

01:42:19.551 --> 01:42:20.635
for an inquiry.

01:42:21.553 --> 01:42:23.471
What do I have to go
to New York for?

01:42:25.348 --> 01:42:26.808
For harboring
a fugitive.

01:42:27.392 --> 01:42:30.562
How can I be a fugitive
if I were dead?

01:42:32.564 --> 01:42:35.900
I don't know, but
the FBI will know.

01:42:37.026 --> 01:42:38.444
I hope they throw
the book at you.

01:42:38.611 --> 01:42:40.280
Oh, shut up,
you little termite.

01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:43.992
Lieutenant,
newspaper reporters

01:42:44.159 --> 01:42:45.493
are crawling
all over the place.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.164
Well, tell them...

01:42:49.831 --> 01:42:51.958
An official statement
will be forthcoming.

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.500
All right.

01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:02.177
I have nothing
more to say.

01:43:06.848 --> 01:43:08.349
Get ready
to leave tonight.

01:43:08.516 --> 01:43:09.642
Suits me fine.

01:43:09.809 --> 01:43:11.102
What did they ask you?

01:43:11.269 --> 01:43:12.937
I ain't going back
to New York.

01:43:13.104 --> 01:43:14.647
What about
Antoinette?

01:43:14.898 --> 01:43:16.316
She's bad luck.

01:43:29.996 --> 01:43:32.040
What was I supposed
to think?

01:43:32.457 --> 01:43:34.918
You, missing.
He was alive.

01:43:35.376 --> 01:43:36.961
I knew he was only
after your money.

01:43:37.253 --> 01:43:38.379
Good evening, ladies.

01:43:38.546 --> 01:43:41.925
I'm happy to report
everything's been taken care of.

01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:45.011
Wonderful! Isn't that
wonderful, darling?

01:43:49.265 --> 01:43:51.851
She hasn't spoken a word
since her return.

01:43:52.018 --> 01:43:53.728
She's been through
a terrible ordeal.

01:43:53.895 --> 01:43:56.397
Yes.
My poor little baby.

01:43:56.773 --> 01:43:57.689
John Arlington

01:43:57.690 --> 01:43:59.317
has been compensated
for his discomfort,

01:43:59.484 --> 01:44:02.987
if Antoinette would like the marriage
annulled, I'd be very happy to arrange it.

01:44:03.655 --> 01:44:05.698
What about the
inheritance money?

01:44:06.866 --> 01:44:08.117
I'm afraid, my dear,

01:44:08.576 --> 01:44:11.996
you're at the mercy
of your loving stepdaughter.

01:44:18.753 --> 01:44:21.589
Antoinette,
my poor, poor baby.

01:44:21.756 --> 01:44:22.924
What do you want?

01:44:23.299 --> 01:44:25.927
Darling,
now that you're home,

01:44:26.094 --> 01:44:28.346
I want us so much
to become friends.

01:44:28.763 --> 01:44:29.973
We've never
been friends,

01:44:30.139 --> 01:44:31.557
and we never
will be.

01:44:33.643 --> 01:44:34.727
But don't worry.

01:44:35.395 --> 01:44:36.795
I won't throw you
out on the streets

01:44:36.896 --> 01:44:38.106
where you belong.

01:45:20.231 --> 01:45:23.026
So long, Bronco Billy.

01:45:29.907 --> 01:45:32.076
<i>Boss, how soon
do you think</i>

01:45:32.243 --> 01:45:33.911
before we can
show our faces?

01:45:36.372 --> 01:45:37.832
I would say
that last round

01:45:37.999 --> 01:45:40.293
put us very close
to the poorhouse.

01:45:41.878 --> 01:45:43.629
We show our faces,

01:45:44.130 --> 01:45:46.507
and those feds will be
on us like flies.

01:45:48.926 --> 01:45:50.470
Nothing in
the paper about us.

01:45:50.636 --> 01:45:52.680
That's an old
FBI trick

01:45:52.847 --> 01:45:54.891
to make us think
the coast is clear.

01:45:55.516 --> 01:45:56.601
<i>You figuring on us</i>

01:45:56.768 --> 01:45:58.728
<i>shooting it out
with the FBI?</i>

01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:04.192
Bronco Billy ain't afraid
of no tinhorn sheriff.

01:46:04.359 --> 01:46:05.651
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

01:46:05.818 --> 01:46:07.904
What about hiding out
in the mountains?

01:46:09.572 --> 01:46:11.212
Have you ever hidden
out in the mountains?

01:46:11.366 --> 01:46:12.366
No.

01:46:12.617 --> 01:46:13.826
It snows
in the mountains.

01:46:13.993 --> 01:46:14.993
Get the picture?

01:46:15.745 --> 01:46:16.745
Yep.

01:46:17.622 --> 01:46:18.580
Maybe we could live

01:46:18.581 --> 01:46:20.750
happily ever after
in this bar.

01:46:22.210 --> 01:46:24.003
That ain't
too funny, doc.

01:46:24.754 --> 01:46:27.757
What do you say we show
the folks in this town

01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:32.845
a first-class
wild west show?

01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:36.057
Bronco Billy ain't
afraid of nothing.

01:46:36.641 --> 01:46:40.019
Doc, I ain't never seen
the boss drink so much.

01:46:41.145 --> 01:46:42.145
He's never been in love

01:46:42.271 --> 01:46:44.649
with a woman
like Miss Lily before.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.240
Keep the change,
buddy.

01:46:53.366 --> 01:46:55.368
Hey, you owe me
another buck here.

01:46:56.119 --> 01:46:57.662
I'll catch up
to you.

01:47:13.636 --> 01:47:14.636
Hello.

01:47:14.762 --> 01:47:17.491
<i>I have a collect call for
Miss Antoinette Lily from Running Water.</i>

01:47:17.515 --> 01:47:19.142
<i>Will you accept
the charges?</i>

01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:23.937
Yes!

01:47:23.938 --> 01:47:24.938
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:26.189
Antoinette?

01:47:26.524 --> 01:47:28.025
Running water,
where are you?

01:47:28.317 --> 01:47:29.485
<i>Boise, Idaho.</i>

01:47:31.112 --> 01:47:32.447
How's Bronco Billy?

01:47:32.822 --> 01:47:34.866
He needs you.
Badly.

01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:42.290
We'll cut the show
a little bit tonight.

01:47:42.457 --> 01:47:43.916
You can be
my assistant.

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.419
It's a shame
Miss Lily's not here.

01:47:47.628 --> 01:47:50.298
Miss Lily? I thought you
didn't like her.

01:47:50.465 --> 01:47:51.883
I never said
I didn't like her.

01:47:52.425 --> 01:47:54.135
I just said she
brought us bad luck.

01:47:54.594 --> 01:47:55.678
Well, she did.

01:47:56.012 --> 01:47:57.180
No, she didn't.

01:47:57.513 --> 01:47:59.640
She was the best assistant
we ever had.

01:47:59.807 --> 01:48:01.392
She could throw
a plate...

01:48:01.559 --> 01:48:03.036
haven't you got
something better to do

01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:05.313
besides hang around
like a coyote in heat?

01:48:06.981 --> 01:48:07.981
Yeah.

01:48:07.982 --> 01:48:09.066
Sure, boss.

01:48:19.994 --> 01:48:21.454
That's how they
built the tent?

01:48:21.621 --> 01:48:22.997
That's the best
they know how.

01:48:23.164 --> 01:48:24.540
Something must be
bringing us luck.

01:48:24.707 --> 01:48:26.209
We're almost
sold out for tonight.

01:48:32.423 --> 01:48:34.467
Bronco Billy McCoy

01:48:34.675 --> 01:48:37.178
and his horse, buster!

01:49:03.329 --> 01:49:04.705
Thank you, folks.

01:49:05.248 --> 01:49:06.832
Thank you, folks,

01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:10.002
and especially
my little partners out there.

01:49:10.378 --> 01:49:11.754
Now before we start
the show,

01:49:11.921 --> 01:49:12.921
I'd like to introduce you

01:49:13.005 --> 01:49:14.549
to my assistant
for the evening,

01:49:14.757 --> 01:49:18.427
Mr. Two-gun Lefty LeBow.

01:49:45.705 --> 01:49:49.000
Uh... Miss Antoinette Lily.

01:50:02.054 --> 01:50:03.054
A little late,
ain't you?

01:50:03.639 --> 01:50:05.239
I was waiting for you
to come and get me.

01:50:05.766 --> 01:50:08.728
I got you, and I'm never
letting you go.

01:50:11.731 --> 01:50:12.731
Come on.

01:50:13.232 --> 01:50:14.400
She's back!

01:51:11.248 --> 01:51:12.958
<i>Lasso Leonard James!</i>

01:51:13.292 --> 01:51:14.919
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:51:15.503 --> 01:51:17.338
<i>lasso Leonard James!</i>

01:51:17.630 --> 01:51:18.839

01:53:15.956 --> 01:53:18.459
We come to the end
of our show.

01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:20.920
Thank you very much
for being so kind to us.

01:53:35.476 --> 01:53:36.769
I've got
a special message

01:53:36.936 --> 01:53:38.562
for you little partners
out there.

01:53:38.896 --> 01:53:40.898
Finish your oatmeal
at breakfast

01:53:41.065 --> 01:53:42.608
<i>and do as
your ma and pa tell you,</i>

01:53:42.775 --> 01:53:43.984
<i>Beca use they know best.</i>

01:53:44.443 --> 01:53:45.986
Don't ever tell a lie,

01:53:46.487 --> 01:53:48.364
and say your prayers
before bed.

01:53:49.323 --> 01:53:52.535
As our friends
south of the border say,

01:53:53.244 --> 01:53:55.246
