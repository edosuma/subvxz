10:04.666 --> 10:06.792
You've desecrated my body.

10:06.793 --> 10:07.877
Buy me lunch?

10:07.878 --> 10:09.295
Nope.

10:09.296 --> 10:10.796
Got to go to the doctor's.

10:10.797 --> 10:13.090
Drive you home instead?

10:13.091 --> 10:16.177
Fine.

10:16.178 --> 10:19.597
It's just different is all I'm saying.

10:19.598 --> 10:22.641
Like different good?

10:22.642 --> 10:25.603
You seem adventurous.

10:25.604 --> 10:28.063
Thank you.

10:28.064 --> 10:30.191
You know...

10:30.192 --> 10:34.653
I really admire their use
of the tiny skillet.

10:34.654 --> 10:36.655
Skillet toffee fudge brownie,

10:36.656 --> 10:38.866
skillet chocolate chip cookie.

10:38.867 --> 10:39.909
What about me?

10:39.910 --> 10:42.494
You notice anything different?

10:42.495 --> 10:43.537
Nope.

10:43.538 --> 10:45.122
[inaudible dialogue]

10:45.123 --> 10:49.960
You're like the Chili's of sex.

10:49.961 --> 10:51.921
Wow.

10:51.922 --> 10:54.548
What I mean is,

10:54.549 --> 10:59.220
you're the best sex I've had since you.

10:59.221 --> 11:01.639
Attention, Chili's customers!

11:01.640 --> 11:07.144
We have a very special birthday!

11:11.816 --> 11:14.053
- Whoo!
- Happy birthday.

11:16.112 --> 11:19.615
Can we get this in a to-go box, please?

11:19.616 --> 11:21.590
- [exhales]
- Oh, absolutely.

11:26.456 --> 11:28.353
- Whew.
- Ooh.

11:29.962 --> 11:31.543
You know what?

11:31.544 --> 11:32.586
I lost my favorite red sunglasses

11:32.587 --> 11:34.755
with the little tiny frames.

11:34.756 --> 11:36.382
That's okay. It's not that bright.

11:36.383 --> 11:38.592
Plus, I only had one drink.

11:38.593 --> 11:40.386
Okay, I had two drinks,

11:40.387 --> 11:43.389
which either way, is still very mature

11:43.390 --> 11:47.393
for a woman who's 40 to do.

11:47.394 --> 11:49.270
And it's not like anybody

11:49.271 --> 11:50.896
gets pulled over during the day, right?

11:50.897 --> 11:52.022
Nobody does.

11:52.023 --> 11:53.732
I'll drive.

11:53.733 --> 11:56.735
Okay.

11:56.736 --> 11:59.071
JACK: I think you did the right thing.

11:59.072 --> 12:00.572
ALEX: Yeah.

12:00.573 --> 12:01.949
She didn't give me much of a choice.

12:01.950 --> 12:03.492
Still, you don't...

12:03.493 --> 12:05.244
you don't move in
without a conversation.

12:05.245 --> 12:06.829
Yeah.

12:06.830 --> 12:09.248
I wasn't good to her.

12:09.249 --> 12:11.792
I get so caught up in things, you know?

12:11.793 --> 12:15.129
There's this immediacy, this energy.

12:15.130 --> 12:17.214
And then you wake up one day,
and it's just gone.

12:17.215 --> 12:19.091
I don't think it's gone.
I think it's just in motion.

12:19.092 --> 12:21.010
That's what the universe does:
It cycles energy.

12:21.011 --> 12:25.222
When you get some, you just got
to appreciate it for what it is.

12:25.223 --> 12:27.349
Hmm. I like that.

12:27.350 --> 12:29.476
In the long run, it's probably
better for everybody.

12:29.477 --> 12:30.811
Sarah moves on. You move on.

12:30.812 --> 12:32.187
Mm.

12:32.188 --> 12:33.814
We weren't right for each other.

12:33.815 --> 12:35.607
A lot of people aren't.

12:35.608 --> 12:37.693
It's amazing how many people
don't know anything

12:37.694 --> 12:39.611
about the person that they're with.

12:39.612 --> 12:41.196
You know who really knows me?

12:41.197 --> 12:43.073
My Spotify Discover Weekly playlist.

12:43.074 --> 12:44.700
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

12:44.701 --> 12:46.160
- That shit is amazing.
- And totally non-judgmental.

12:46.161 --> 12:47.786
[laughs] Yeah.

12:47.787 --> 12:49.913
You want to find true compatibility:

12:49.914 --> 12:54.168
Cross reference Spotify, Amazon,
Postmates, and porn.

12:54.169 --> 12:56.879
And if you synch up on those,
that's your person.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.381
That's great. Good luck coding that.

12:59.382 --> 13:00.424
I could do it.

13:00.425 --> 13:01.675
Yeah?

13:01.676 --> 13:03.260
Sure, if I had access to the accounts.

13:03.261 --> 13:04.678
I have a tech guy I work with

13:04.679 --> 13:06.180
that loves this kind of stuff, actually.

13:06.181 --> 13:08.849
You should... you should
float that to him.

13:08.850 --> 13:12.519
Okay.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.021
How are we looking?

13:14.022 --> 13:16.648
It's like a medium rare Noah's ark.

13:16.649 --> 13:20.861
Knew it.

13:20.862 --> 13:24.156
This is so delicious.

13:24.157 --> 13:25.657
Oh, my god.

13:25.658 --> 13:28.160
I mean, I hate the word "moist,"

13:28.161 --> 13:31.038
but I gotta say that's exactly
what this is.

13:31.039 --> 13:32.414
This is very moist.

13:32.415 --> 13:35.292
It's... it's moist.

13:35.293 --> 13:37.503
Mm!

13:37.504 --> 13:39.244
What are we doing?

13:42.300 --> 13:44.093
Um...

13:44.094 --> 13:46.303
I'm...

13:46.304 --> 13:48.722
I'm sleeping with my ex-husband.

13:48.723 --> 13:51.308
And trying to regain
some semblance of control

13:51.309 --> 13:53.727
of a life that's increasingly
without definition.

13:53.728 --> 13:56.030
You, I have no fuckin' idea.

13:59.484 --> 14:00.859
I made a mistake.

14:00.860 --> 14:04.696

I want you back.

You don't get to do that.

14:37.522 --> 14:41.525
This was fun and terrible.

14:41.526 --> 14:43.527
And when it got too much, we stopped.

14:43.528 --> 14:45.070
That's what this was.

14:45.071 --> 14:47.029
I miss our life.

14:50.118 --> 14:51.994
So did I.

14:51.995 --> 14:54.329

15:32.535 --> 15:33.744
- You too.
- How about a drink?

Yes.

you're not reading
too much into all this.

Into what?

Well, Jack offered to come early
to help with the food prep.

15:59.771 --> 16:01.563
And I totally would have invited
you early too,

16:01.564 --> 16:03.857
but we got to talking
and the day got away from us,

16:03.858 --> 16:05.192
and you understand, right?

16:05.193 --> 16:07.486
It's nothing personal.

Don't let it trouble you.

Why is Jack here?

17:31.738 --> 17:33.322
Because I invited him.

17:33.323 --> 17:35.073
Yeah, that much I gathered.

17:35.074 --> 17:36.199
He's fantastic, by the way.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.701
I can tell why you like him.

17:37.702 --> 17:39.536
Did you give my number to the Democrats?

17:39.537 --> 17:40.704
- Alex.
- Look.

17:40.705 --> 17:43.081
I know I came between you guys

17:43.082 --> 17:44.625
and I can tell you were good together,

17:44.626 --> 17:49.129
so this is my way of saying I'm sorry;

17:49.130 --> 17:50.297
That I approve.

I don't need your approval.

would have done just fine.

louder than words.

could just talk to me about it.

- We could bury this.
- Totally.

There's a poem that I've
always wanted to share with you.

20:04.265 --> 20:07.726
And this seems as good a time as any.

20:07.727 --> 20:12.230
It's called "Love After Love."

20:12.231 --> 20:16.651
The time will come when, with elation

20:16.652 --> 20:21.448
you will greet yourself
arriving at your own door,

20:21.449 --> 20:23.867
in your own mirror

20:23.868 --> 20:27.996
and each will smile
at the other's welcome,

20:27.997 --> 20:30.707
and say, sit here.

20:30.708 --> 20:31.792
Eat.

20:31.793 --> 20:33.293
[quietly] Excuse me.

20:33.294 --> 20:35.170
You will love again the stranger

20:35.171 --> 20:39.925

Oh, my god, this party is tragic.

I went to the doctor's.

They ran some tests, and it's shrinking.

20:59.904 --> 21:02.286
I'll, uh, come to you.
