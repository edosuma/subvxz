00:34.140 --> 00:36.984
Graduation

02:33.860 --> 02:35.021
What happened?

02:35.220 --> 02:37.222
Someone threw a stone.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.549
- Did you see who?
- No.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.741
Weird.

02:41.940 --> 02:42.623
Indeed.

02:44.180 --> 02:45.341
<i>Hows Mum'?</i>

02:45.540 --> 02:46.746
She's got a headache.

02:47.060 --> 02:48.789
There's water boiling here.

02:49.060 --> 02:51.108
It's for her steam remedy.

02:51.460 --> 02:52.950
Hurry up, it's late.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.027
Yes.

02:54.660 --> 02:57.345
- We're nearly out of toothpaste.
- OK.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.671
- Bye, Mum.
- Bye, love.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.983
- I got your lunch.
- Thanks.

03:06.780 --> 03:08.703
Are you OK? Need anything?

03:08.940 --> 03:09.827
No.

03:10.220 --> 03:12.109
I brought the hot water in.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.631
On the table?

03:13.820 --> 03:15.310
I put a cloth under it.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.582
Any idea who broke our window?

03:17.780 --> 03:18.542
No.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.908
- I'll be outside.
- OK.

03:22.100 --> 03:25.741
- My God, who'd do...
- Magda, I'm off, it's late.

03:27.660 --> 03:28.582
Bye.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.423
- Did you make the bookings?
- Yes.

03:54.700 --> 03:55.906
For what date?

03:56.100 --> 03:56.942
The 24th.

03:57.140 --> 03:58.471
Isn't that too late?

03:58.940 --> 04:01.591
Classes start
on the 1st of October there.

04:01.780 --> 04:04.226
Could we get you settled in 6 days?

04:04.540 --> 04:05.189
Yes.

04:09.260 --> 04:10.102
What is it?

04:13.420 --> 04:15.821
Nothing.
Just thinking about leaving.

04:16.019 --> 04:18.591
Thinking?
You should be glad.

04:18.860 --> 04:21.226
If I were your age now...

04:24.260 --> 04:26.661
I'm thinking of my friends.

04:26.860 --> 04:29.511
Friends!
You'll make new ones there.

04:29.700 --> 04:30.508
Right.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.827
You can't stay here for friends!

04:34.180 --> 04:36.262
Do what's best for you!

04:36.460 --> 04:37.382
Yes.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.706
Today's just revision?

04:41.940 --> 04:43.465
But I'm getting nervous.

04:43.660 --> 04:45.025
About the Romanian test?

04:45.220 --> 04:47.029
No. Just in general.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.151
Relax. You've already done
the hard bit.

04:50.860 --> 04:51.907
Yeah.

04:57.820 --> 04:59.663
I'll meet you when you're done?

05:00.380 --> 05:02.542
No, I have my motorcycle lesson.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.744
Marius will pick you up?

05:04.940 --> 05:05.827
Yes.

05:08.620 --> 05:09.701
Be careful.

05:10.540 --> 05:11.462
I will.

05:12.420 --> 05:14.502
Drop me here if you're in a rush.

05:14.700 --> 05:15.906
Is it OK?

05:16.140 --> 05:17.062
Sure.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.351
All right then.

05:22.260 --> 05:23.102
Bye.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.142
Bye.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.546
This little one's almost
faded away.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.220
You're just saying that.

06:22.260 --> 06:24.103
Is this the standard treatment?

06:24.300 --> 06:26.621
Only for females.

06:38.660 --> 06:39.946
They're calling you.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.306
Answer it.

06:48.180 --> 06:49.670
Please, answer it.

07:02.420 --> 07:03.307
Yes.

07:26.300 --> 07:26.983
What?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.342
Somebody attacked Eliza.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.511
She's in hospital.

07:31.780 --> 07:32.986
Didn't you drive her?

07:33.180 --> 07:35.911
I dropped her off
across the street.

07:36.940 --> 07:39.989
What are you waiting for? Go!

07:40.540 --> 07:42.224
Go! Call me if I can help.

07:43.940 --> 07:45.021
Doctor!

07:51.420 --> 07:53.184
I'm here, doctor!

07:57.340 --> 07:58.910
I've talked to Pandele.

07:59.060 --> 08:02.030
She seems more scared than hurt.

08:02.260 --> 08:03.750
Why didn't you.

08:03.940 --> 08:06.671
Magda, please, don't start.

08:06.860 --> 08:08.225
Just tell me.

08:08.420 --> 08:10.388
It was faster on foot!

08:10.580 --> 08:13.629
- Where were you?
- The other wing.

08:13.820 --> 08:16.585
And please, don't start.

08:17.460 --> 08:18.905
I'm listening, doctor.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.031
I'm out here with my wife.

08:23.580 --> 08:25.105
We'll come in then.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.470
Her head is fine.
Her arm's a bit hurt.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.991
She's a bit dazed,
I gave her a Diazepam.

08:41.179 --> 08:44.627
We'll X-ray her arm.
She was hurt defending herself.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.504
It's all right now.

08:48.100 --> 08:53.186
File the complaint today.
There's a better chance he'll be caught.

08:53.580 --> 08:56.151
- Had she more than one bank card?
- No.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.468
- Only this.
- But her SIM card...

08:58.660 --> 08:59.991
Already locked.

09:00.180 --> 09:02.786
Thank you, Georgiana,
I owe you one.

09:04.260 --> 09:06.262
- Did you try her phone?
- It's off.

09:06.460 --> 09:07.700
Thanks, Csilla.

09:07.940 --> 09:10.546
Shall I call your friend
in the police?

09:10.740 --> 09:11.548
- Ivanov.
- Yes.

09:11.740 --> 09:14.630
- He could take her statement.
- Call him.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.391
No, she must see photos of suspects.

09:17.580 --> 09:20.424
And change the locks.
He took her keys too.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.463
Could you leave us alone?

09:22.660 --> 09:23.900
I'm sorry.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.228
Tell X-ray we're on our way.

09:51.380 --> 09:54.031
She sprained her wrist
defending herself.

09:55.540 --> 09:58.908
Gynecology confirmed there are
no traces of semen.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.387
The bastard
didn't get an erection.

10:01.580 --> 10:02.911
How do you know?

10:03.100 --> 10:04.590
Eliza told us.

10:05.100 --> 10:08.627
It didn't seem like
she lost her virginity recently,

10:08.820 --> 10:10.982
so we asked her
what happened.

10:14.460 --> 10:17.031
Sorry but I thought
you should know.

10:17.220 --> 10:18.460
Of course.

10:20.860 --> 10:23.022
It's OK,
given the circumstances.

10:23.260 --> 10:25.547
- It could have been worse.
- Sure.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.390
- I'll be off.
- Thank you.

10:34.060 --> 10:34.979
No.

10:34.980 --> 10:35.230
No.

10:37.660 --> 10:38.547
No.

10:39.860 --> 10:40.747
No.

10:41.980 --> 10:45.268
That's all the rapists we have.
What now, sir?

10:45.460 --> 10:46.985
<i>Gaâ€œ Gem fox (he sketch.</i>

10:47.180 --> 10:48.830
He's on his way.

10:49.860 --> 10:51.669
- Take her statement.
- Yes.

10:53.660 --> 10:56.948
- On his way here or to his girl?
- I didn't ask.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.747
Here.

10:59.540 --> 11:00.905
And a pen.

11:01.180 --> 11:02.909
Now write this...

11:03.300 --> 11:06.622
I, the undersigned,
residing at...

11:07.460 --> 11:08.621
Can I get you a coffee?

11:08.820 --> 11:10.629
I've had <i>3</i> already.

11:10.820 --> 11:13.471
- A bit much for a doctor?
- Right...

11:13.660 --> 11:17.107
Hereby declare that,
and write the date and time...

11:17.340 --> 11:20.230
It was 7:54. I had a call just then.

11:20.420 --> 11:24.141
At 1:54, in the area
between Republic Street and...

11:24.340 --> 11:25.626
Piscului.

11:27.260 --> 11:29.308
Crossing a construction site...

11:29.500 --> 11:30.786
To school.

11:30.980 --> 11:32.266
Let her do this.

11:33.140 --> 11:36.781
I was approached by a man,
and we'll describe him...

11:37.140 --> 11:39.381
They've been building there forever.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.469
A backroom deal?

11:41.660 --> 11:43.264
Isn't it always?

11:43.820 --> 11:45.948
So, I was approached by a man...

11:46.140 --> 11:50.190
Who put a knife to my throat...

11:51.020 --> 11:53.022
Did he say anything before?

11:53.220 --> 11:53.982
No.

11:54.660 --> 11:58.062
...and he threatened me, saying...

11:58.540 --> 12:01.510
...that he would kill me...

12:03.580 --> 12:05.742
if I refused to have

12:05.940 --> 12:08.420
sexual intercourse with him.

12:08.780 --> 12:11.260
Why did we abolish
the death sentence?

12:13.140 --> 12:15.268
He came up to you on the site?

12:15.460 --> 12:16.905
On the sidewalk.

12:17.540 --> 12:19.304
So he pulled you in there?

12:19.500 --> 12:20.467
Yes.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.590
Were there people around?

12:23.980 --> 12:25.220
I think so.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.225
Didn't they notice?

12:28.500 --> 12:29.911
I don't know.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.348
Did you scream or anything?

12:32.740 --> 12:36.381
No, he put his hand over my mouth
right away.

12:37.140 --> 12:39.586
So he pulled you behind a wall?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.228
There was a container.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.548
And he pulled his trousers down?

12:45.460 --> 12:48.703
He pulled his trousers down...

12:49.140 --> 12:50.585
and he pulled me to him.

12:50.780 --> 12:52.669
Let's get out for a bit.

12:53.020 --> 12:55.944
- It's fine, you can stay.
- No, we're going.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.187
Are you OK?

12:57.740 --> 13:00.425
Come on, she's a grown-up!

13:09.580 --> 13:11.264
Don't worry, we'll get him.

13:11.780 --> 13:14.101
You think that's what I care about?

13:14.580 --> 13:16.503
I know but it's all we can do.

13:17.420 --> 13:20.230
She starts university in the UK
in September.

13:20.420 --> 13:21.387
Great.

13:21.740 --> 13:24.220
Two universities offered her
scholarships.

13:24.420 --> 13:26.900
- Impressive! What field?
- Psychology.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.350
- She's a hard worker, my girl.
- I can imagine.

13:31.180 --> 13:33.103
But she needs to pass her finals.

13:33.340 --> 13:36.025
Finals!
It's good she's got a scholarship.

13:36.260 --> 13:37.989
It depends on her final grades.

13:38.220 --> 13:41.667
- Stuff like this happens.
- Around here, it does!

13:41.860 --> 13:44.306
- It happens there too...
- Not so much.

13:45.060 --> 13:47.461
They're more civilised, more...

13:47.700 --> 13:49.145
She was all set to leave...

13:49.340 --> 13:51.707
Sure. What would she stay here for?

13:52.220 --> 13:54.791
- Were the tests in English?
- All of them.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.740
Private tutoring since 5th grade...

13:57.980 --> 14:00.108
A great English teacher at school...

14:00.380 --> 14:04.180
You know her. She was in that accident
at the bridge...

14:04.500 --> 14:06.707
A year ago.

14:06.940 --> 14:08.066
The one with the child!

14:09.740 --> 14:11.424
Your girl has her finals, too...

14:11.620 --> 14:13.588
Yes. Top grades in chemistry.

14:13.780 --> 14:14.622
Congratulations!

14:14.820 --> 14:16.663
I'll get her a job with us.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.261
Do you see her often?

14:18.660 --> 14:21.425
She calls me
when I'm late with the alimony.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.147
How's Oana?

14:23.740 --> 14:25.424
She moved to Sebes.

14:25.780 --> 14:28.351
She met a guy with three children.

14:28.540 --> 14:30.030
She's got so fat-

14:30.220 --> 14:31.551
- No!
- Oh yes.

14:31.740 --> 14:34.425
- Sir?
- Quickly. Do the sketch.

14:34.620 --> 14:35.507
<i>On my 'NW-</i>

14:35.700 --> 14:39.341
Gelu's an artist,
Romeo's a doctor in our hospital.

14:39.540 --> 14:43.306
Really? Could he maybe
put in a word for my godfather?

14:43.540 --> 14:44.951
<i>Remember Bum'?</i>

14:45.140 --> 14:46.380
- I'll be going.
- Go.

14:46.980 --> 14:49.142
He got us out of military service.
At 18.

14:49.340 --> 14:52.230
- Ex-head of customs?
- He's deputy mayor now.

14:52.420 --> 14:53.626
What about him?

14:53.820 --> 14:57.620
He has cirrhosis or something.
He urgently needs a liver.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.071
I don't know...

15:00.260 --> 15:03.548
For transplants,
there's a national waiting list.

15:04.060 --> 15:06.347
But I talked to Tiberiu in Bucharest.

15:06.540 --> 15:09.271
He's working in
the Ministry of Health now.

15:09.460 --> 15:10.985
- Boghean?
- Precisely.

15:11.180 --> 15:11.988
I know him.

15:12.180 --> 15:16.265
He promised to help.
Bulai has always helped everybody.

15:16.460 --> 15:17.905
Always helpful and kind.

15:18.060 --> 15:19.903
So what am I supposed to do?

15:20.060 --> 15:22.904
Call Boghean to bump
his name up the list.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.145
I know, but...

15:26.340 --> 15:29.344
He'll die if we don't.
He helped everybody.

15:29.540 --> 15:30.905
Please.

15:31.380 --> 15:33.382
- I'll see what I can do.
- Sir?

15:34.100 --> 15:37.309
He looks like the convict
who escaped yesterday.

15:37.940 --> 15:40.386
Given how you've drawn him...

15:40.580 --> 15:42.070
She doesn't remember.

15:42.260 --> 15:43.944
Go and do it properly.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.342
What?

15:55.540 --> 15:57.827
I keep wondering
who broke our window.

15:58.780 --> 16:02.307
Who knows?
There are all kinds of people.

16:03.140 --> 16:04.301
Still, it's strange.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.740
Watch out!

16:08.500 --> 16:09.626
Are you all right?

16:10.020 --> 16:10.828
Yes.

16:35.860 --> 16:36.907
What was it?

16:37.820 --> 16:39.151
A dog, I guess.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.224
Here's the old lock.

16:51.460 --> 16:54.384
Call me when you decide
about the grille.

16:54.620 --> 16:55.951
I'll talk to my wife.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.666
Bars are safer
for the ground floor.

16:58.860 --> 16:59.907
Of course.

17:00.060 --> 17:00.902
Thank you.

17:01.140 --> 17:03.108
- Call me.
- Yes.

17:03.300 --> 17:04.983
I'm done, goodbye!

17:05.180 --> 17:06.386
Goodbye.

17:07.700 --> 17:10.067
- My best to your daughter.
- Thank you.

17:10.260 --> 17:13.150
I had a cousin who got raped
For years she-

17:13.339 --> 17:14.465
No...

17:15.220 --> 17:18.269
No, my girl wasn't raped,
Just assaulted.

17:19.380 --> 17:20.426
Goodbye then.

18:55.580 --> 18:56.706
How is she?

18:57.700 --> 18:59.190
How do you think?

19:02.180 --> 19:03.261
Magda...

19:05.100 --> 19:07.228
Did you know Eliza
isn't a virgin?

19:08.620 --> 19:10.224
I had an idea.

19:11.380 --> 19:12.905
Why didn't you tell me?

19:14.020 --> 19:17.502
It's personal,
you don't just talk about it.

19:17.780 --> 19:19.748
So how did you know?

19:20.740 --> 19:22.663
Because I'm her mother.

19:23.740 --> 19:28.382
Magda, we agreed that
when it comes to Eliza, we talk.

19:28.860 --> 19:30.385
I didn't hide anything.

19:30.580 --> 19:35.222
Maybe she doesn't want
to talk about this with you.

19:36.020 --> 19:38.261
She can discuss anything with me.

19:40.860 --> 19:42.783
Why didn't she then?

19:43.580 --> 19:44.581
I don't know.

19:45.980 --> 19:47.903
Maybe you told her not to?

19:48.100 --> 19:50.626
I thought we had a real talk.

19:52.820 --> 19:53.901
Do you like

19:54.740 --> 19:57.903
this motorcycle instructor
she hangs out with?

19:58.060 --> 20:00.984
Whether I do or not,
it's her business now.

20:01.180 --> 20:05.390
Encourage her to date a guy
who sells used cars from Germany!

20:05.580 --> 20:07.389
He doesn't sell them.

20:07.580 --> 20:10.504
He just brought over
a bike for himself.

20:10.700 --> 20:11.622
Yes, right.

20:12.140 --> 20:14.302
Want me to pick her boyfriends?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.025
Let her experience life.

20:16.220 --> 20:20.942
Nowadays you don't have to marry
the first guy you hold hands with.

20:21.140 --> 20:24.110
As if I was
the first you held hands with.

20:24.460 --> 20:27.111
Relax, I wasn't thinking of you.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.545
Not everything's about you,
you know.

20:33.020 --> 20:35.148
I'll pack her school lunch.

20:35.620 --> 20:38.021
Should she sit the exam tomorrow?

20:38.300 --> 20:39.711
Of course.

20:40.300 --> 20:43.622
You think this is something
you just shake oft?

20:43.820 --> 20:47.461
Magda! Her scholarship depends on it!
Be responsible!

20:47.980 --> 20:51.905
I am, but it's not like
today didn't happen. It happened.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.786
She can't throw away
all her work because of an accident.

20:55.980 --> 20:58.381
Accident?
So rape is an accident?

20:58.580 --> 21:01.902
He didn't rape her!
Stop saying that, all of you!

21:02.100 --> 21:03.545
He just forced his head...

21:03.740 --> 21:04.502
Stop it!

21:04.700 --> 21:07.306
She'll sit the exam,
and that's final!

21:17.300 --> 21:19.382
It's time to let her decide.

21:19.580 --> 21:23.062
I will. And she'll agree,
you'll see.

21:23.260 --> 21:24.830
Just don't meddle.

21:25.780 --> 21:27.623
Could you two keep it down?

21:28.540 --> 21:30.508
Where are your socks?

21:33.980 --> 21:35.141
Eliza.

21:36.060 --> 21:39.701
Tomorrow I'll see
if we can postpone the exam.

21:40.100 --> 21:43.468
But if we can't,
you have to do your best.

21:44.540 --> 21:46.463
I don't know if I can write.

21:46.820 --> 21:50.347
Everybody will be nice to you.
They'll understand.

21:55.820 --> 21:57.788
I'm going to bed now.

24:34.860 --> 24:35.986
Excuse me, madam!

24:36.340 --> 24:37.466
Madam!

24:39.260 --> 24:40.386
Good morning.

24:40.660 --> 24:43.709
I have to talk to an exam supervisor.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.749
But the guards here claim...

24:45.940 --> 24:49.103
- Parents are not allowed.
- It's fine, don't worry.

24:49.300 --> 24:51.507
There are rules-

24:51.700 --> 24:55.022
Don't worry, I'll handle it!

24:59.940 --> 25:03.023
Doctor,
I agree it's a prestigious university,

25:03.220 --> 25:05.427
but the regulations state that-

25:05.620 --> 25:08.703
Mr. President.
Do they state "no casts allowed"?

25:08.940 --> 25:11.625
We have to rule out
all possible fraud.

25:11.820 --> 25:14.551
Her final high school average was 9.5!

25:14.740 --> 25:19.541
Yes but last year we had a good student
with notes in his plaster.

25:19.740 --> 25:22.141
Isn't it a case-by-case decision?

25:22.340 --> 25:24.308
Yes, but the procedure-

25:24.500 --> 25:27.106
She was attacked
in front of the school!

25:27.300 --> 25:29.985
Not in the school
so it's not our fault!

25:30.180 --> 25:32.182
It's never the school's fault, is it?

25:32.380 --> 25:35.702
Doctor, we're deeply sorry,
but the rules-

25:35.940 --> 25:38.671
Please just allow her to sit the exam!

25:38.860 --> 25:41.909
Let the board decide
if she's to be disqualified.

25:42.180 --> 25:44.262
But please give her a chance!

25:45.540 --> 25:49.181
Send her in.
And let's hope we get no complaints.

25:49.380 --> 25:53.021
You won't.
Thank you, I'm in your debt.

25:54.700 --> 25:55.508
Let's go.

26:52.140 --> 26:54.950
- Did you bring my results?
- There.

26:55.620 --> 26:58.942
They changed your medication.
You're on Cavinton now.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.102
For a month, then we'll see.

27:04.100 --> 27:04.942
Wait...

27:06.300 --> 27:07.631
There's a page missing?

27:07.820 --> 27:11.711
Really, Mum, don't you trust me?

27:13.060 --> 27:15.381
Here. Take this when you go.

27:15.580 --> 27:16.627
What's this?

27:16.940 --> 27:20.149
The photo album.
I found it in the cabinet.

27:20.980 --> 27:22.630
Don't you want to keep it?

27:22.940 --> 27:24.942
Eliza may want it, when she leaves.

27:25.260 --> 27:26.910
There are photos of her.

27:28.500 --> 27:29.501
Fine.

27:30.740 --> 27:33.949
But calm down,
Pandele told you to rest.

27:34.140 --> 27:36.108
You turned the house upside down.

27:36.300 --> 27:39.224
Because I forgot where it was,
that's why.

27:40.580 --> 27:41.786
Fine, fine.

27:42.100 --> 27:44.671
Eliza said she'd stop by, yesterday,

27:44.860 --> 27:46.908
to take up her party dress.

27:47.340 --> 27:51.265
Mum, she's busy with the exams,
with going away...

27:53.860 --> 27:56.704
Don't open for anyone,
some convicts escaped.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.624
It was on the radio.

28:00.420 --> 28:04.391
I don't agree with her leaving,
not one bit.

28:04.620 --> 28:06.110
So what should we do?

28:07.020 --> 28:08.590
You say that now,

28:08.780 --> 28:12.421
but do you know the feeling,
when your child leaves?

28:12.940 --> 28:15.750
I understand, Mum,
but it's for her sake.

28:15.940 --> 28:18.261
What if she studied here in Cluj?

28:18.460 --> 28:20.906
What's there for her here, Mum?

28:21.100 --> 28:22.545
What's so terrible about here?

28:22.740 --> 28:24.583
She has her home,

28:24.780 --> 28:28.387
she has you.
She'd be nearby, you'd have each other.

28:28.940 --> 28:31.705
Everything is difficult here,
you need to-

28:31.940 --> 28:34.591
Do you think
it's any different elsewhere?

28:35.700 --> 28:39.830
She should stay and change things!
If they all leave...

28:40.020 --> 28:43.422
We stayed and what did we change,
in the end?

28:44.100 --> 28:46.467
You changed what could be changed.

28:46.660 --> 28:48.981
There, you don't need connections.

28:49.180 --> 28:51.421
She's not the type to tough it out.

28:51.620 --> 28:53.270
And after we're gone...

28:54.300 --> 28:58.624
It's because you babied her.
She's never had to face trouble.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.391
We had our own share of trouble
already.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.470
I should go now.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.025
Anything else you need?

29:05.220 --> 29:08.429
I told you before, but you forgot.

29:08.620 --> 29:09.542
What?

29:10.580 --> 29:13.231
Clear the grass from the grave.

29:13.660 --> 29:16.789
And pour some concrete,
it's cleaner.

29:16.980 --> 29:18.266
Really, Mum...

29:18.460 --> 29:20.462
Please, do it for me.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.229
I can't do it myself anymore.

29:23.580 --> 29:25.184
Fine, I'll see.

29:26.260 --> 29:27.705
You said that already.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.704
I won't forget. Bye.

29:29.940 --> 29:31.351
Take care.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.351
- Lock the door!
- I will.

29:59.180 --> 30:00.341
How is Eliza doing?

30:00.820 --> 30:01.901
So-so.

30:02.940 --> 30:04.510
Thanks for this morning.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.429
That guy's an idiot.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.944
Good thing it worked out.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.423
For her scholarship, she needs...

30:11.620 --> 30:13.668
At least a 9. On average.

30:17.380 --> 30:18.541
This is so stupid.

30:25.620 --> 30:26.462
What?

30:27.580 --> 30:28.502
Nothing.

30:29.500 --> 30:30.786
Tell me.

30:32.860 --> 30:35.670
It's nothing.
My period is 6 days late.

30:41.420 --> 30:42.751
Why that face?

30:43.500 --> 30:44.706
What face?

30:45.460 --> 30:46.382
That one.

30:47.300 --> 30:48.631
I wasn't expecting it.

30:52.860 --> 30:54.669
Why not?

30:55.700 --> 30:57.509
Shall we talk now?

30:58.140 --> 31:00.142
You seem a bit tense.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.149
Good thing you're so calm.

31:06.420 --> 31:07.581
Isn't that Matei?

31:09.420 --> 31:10.546
Yes.

31:11.140 --> 31:13.063
I couldn't leave him home alone.

31:13.260 --> 31:14.261
I'll be off.

31:36.380 --> 31:37.711
Yes, Magda.

31:38.260 --> 31:40.467
She's out, she's with me.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.229
She just got out.

31:44.700 --> 31:47.544
She did well
on what she could finish.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.947
She didn't do the last two questions.

31:50.820 --> 31:52.106
No, not at all.

31:53.180 --> 31:54.989
She just didn't have time.

31:56.460 --> 31:58.189
You can talk to her at home.

32:00.820 --> 32:02.151
Would you talk to Mum?

32:08.260 --> 32:10.308
Mum, I'll call you later, OK?

32:11.940 --> 32:13.465
No, nothing hurts.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.145
I knew the answers but...

32:17.780 --> 32:18.827
I don't know.

32:20.260 --> 32:21.910
No, that wasn't it.

32:25.740 --> 32:28.505
I call you a bit later, Mum,
OK?

32:31.180 --> 32:33.990
Calm down,
it's not the end of the world.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.949
We'll manage, don't worry.

32:40.180 --> 32:41.705
Shall I drive you home?

32:41.940 --> 32:43.510
No, I'm meeting Marius.

32:44.660 --> 32:46.185
Is that a good idea?

32:46.660 --> 32:48.264
I promised.

33:01.980 --> 33:02.947
Thanks.

33:09.420 --> 33:10.626
Sandu!

33:11.020 --> 33:12.021
<i>Yes, Iâ€œ?</i>

33:12.220 --> 33:14.461
- The doctor's here.
- I'm coming.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.105
What are these for?

33:18.980 --> 33:20.744
I had this breakdown...

33:20.940 --> 33:22.226
Because of the divorce?

33:23.380 --> 33:24.905
Maybe.
No idea.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.944
I panicked.
I'd made a mess of my life...

33:28.140 --> 33:29.551
I'd wasted it...

33:29.940 --> 33:34.150
So I went to a doctor
who told me to get these marbles.

33:34.700 --> 33:37.909
Here's one for each day I've lived

33:38.100 --> 33:39.465
and here, there's one

33:39.820 --> 33:43.029
for each day until I retire,

33:43.220 --> 33:45.985
at 65,
unless they change the law again.

33:46.380 --> 33:50.305
So every evening I move one marble
and think a bit.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.509
Was he a doctor or a priest?

33:52.820 --> 33:56.108
A doctor but you know,
that kind of doctor...

33:57.260 --> 33:59.024
The marking scheme for Romanian.

33:59.380 --> 34:01.189
Well done, Sandu!

34:01.540 --> 34:03.269
- One more task.
- Please.

34:03.460 --> 34:08.148
The good doctor here noticed
a surveillance camera at the comer.

34:08.340 --> 34:09.580
- By the school?
- Yes.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.942
Solved. The recording comes today.

34:12.139 --> 34:13.505
Bravo, Sandu.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.143
- Anything else?
- That's all.

34:16.340 --> 34:17.181
Thank you, sir.

34:21.739 --> 34:23.071
Let's see...

34:24.060 --> 34:27.587
3.2 for the character description.

34:27.780 --> 34:31.545
2.5 for the vocabulary section...
say 2, she didn't finish it...

34:31.860 --> 34:33.908
1.5 for the predicative clause...

34:34.100 --> 34:36.580
My daughter will get a 1,
and Eliza...

34:36.780 --> 34:39.465
- Minus the last 2 questions.
- 8...

34:41.460 --> 34:44.384
- It's the right breakdown?
- Certainly.

34:45.420 --> 34:46.501
Not good, then.

34:46.699 --> 34:49.351
She'd need straight tens
in the next tests.

34:49.540 --> 34:51.110
I believe she can do it.

34:53.139 --> 34:55.029
The September session, maybe?

34:55.500 --> 34:57.423
Too late, I checked.

34:58.740 --> 35:01.425
- You should talk to Bulai.
- About what?

35:01.780 --> 35:03.066
You called about his liver?

35:03.260 --> 35:05.228
Boghean called me yesterday.

35:05.420 --> 35:07.900
Even better. Ask Bulai.
He can help.

35:08.060 --> 35:10.222
What can he do about this?

35:10.620 --> 35:11.951
Want me to call him?

35:12.620 --> 35:13.781
I'll do it.

35:24.540 --> 35:27.191
Hello, sir! How are you doing?

35:28.820 --> 35:31.824
Also busy.
My daughter's doing her final exams.

35:32.180 --> 35:33.545
Yes, thank you.

35:33.940 --> 35:36.181
I have news.
Good news, hopefully.

35:36.460 --> 35:39.669
My friend put in a word
about the transplant.

35:39.860 --> 35:41.703
And we're hoping...

35:41.940 --> 35:43.590
for a positive answer.

35:44.980 --> 35:47.711
It might take a while.
They need a donor first...

35:48.340 --> 35:50.547
Of course we'll let you know,

35:50.740 --> 35:52.265
the good Lord willing.

35:52.500 --> 35:53.911
I have a question, sir.

35:54.100 --> 35:57.946
Could you help Dr. Aldea?
He has a problem.

35:59.140 --> 36:03.190
His daughter narrowly escaped
being raped right by the school.

36:03.460 --> 36:05.906
So she couldn't focus too well

36:06.100 --> 36:08.626
for the written Romanian test today.

36:09.020 --> 36:12.388
She's very good,
she got a scholarship to Cambridge...

36:12.620 --> 36:15.226
But it depends on her results.

36:16.740 --> 36:19.311
He's here with me,
he can tell you more.

36:20.260 --> 36:21.705
Have a good day.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.421
He'll wait for you at 6,
in his office.

36:27.820 --> 36:29.663
Romeo, it's for your child!

36:30.780 --> 36:32.111
Write down his number.

37:26.740 --> 37:26.819
- A bit more?
- I don't drink often.

37:26.820 --> 37:29.187
- A bit more?
- I don't drink often.

37:29.460 --> 37:31.462
Me, I haven't touched alcohol

37:31.660 --> 37:34.027
for exactly a year and 6 months!

37:34.620 --> 37:38.067
But it's too late.
My liver still won't regenerate.

37:38.380 --> 37:39.745
And your test results?

37:39.940 --> 37:42.750
Bad. I haven't done any recently.
Got scared.

37:42.940 --> 37:44.180
You should do them.

37:44.780 --> 37:47.511
Let's get you admitted
for tests tomorrow.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.190
If you say so.

37:49.540 --> 37:53.989
A liver could show up any day,
but if you're not ready...

37:54.180 --> 37:56.990
You've convinced me!
See how easy it was?

37:57.340 --> 37:58.830
Tell me straight:

37:59.140 --> 38:00.744
Is it a difficult operation?

38:01.060 --> 38:04.189
Yes. The body needs
to accept the foreign organ.

38:04.780 --> 38:05.781
In other words,

38:06.380 --> 38:08.826
the first 24 hours are crucial.

38:09.180 --> 38:10.625
Don't scare me.

38:10.980 --> 38:14.666
I won't, but you have responsibilities,
a family...

38:15.100 --> 38:18.070
You need to know the situation
before surgery.

38:18.260 --> 38:22.902
Oh, you're the kind of doctor
who tells his patient the truth.

38:23.180 --> 38:24.625
In your case, yes.

38:24.980 --> 38:27.824
In my mother's case, it's pointless.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.943
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.

38:30.620 --> 38:32.304
But at her age...

38:32.740 --> 38:34.424
So how long do you think

38:34.620 --> 38:36.987
we'll wait for the healthy organ?

38:37.340 --> 38:41.026
It can take years,
or it can happen very quickly.

38:41.300 --> 38:42.825
It depends on donors...

38:43.020 --> 38:45.990
I see.
In any case, I'm ready.

38:46.380 --> 38:48.428
I have my testament, the money...

38:48.620 --> 38:50.429
Money won't be an issue.

38:50.780 --> 38:54.671
Come on, doctor,
don't tell me you live off your salary!

38:54.860 --> 38:56.430
That's not it.

38:57.820 --> 39:01.620
I hope you don't think you owe me
for helping your daughter.

39:01.820 --> 39:05.461
You can't compare a man's life
with some exam. An exam...

39:05.940 --> 39:09.308
I've called Serban,
the exam board chief.

39:09.620 --> 39:12.590
He understood the situation.
He's a nice man, you know...

39:12.860 --> 39:15.101
He came to me once with a problem.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.821
His wife was fired
from the town hall.

39:18.020 --> 39:20.421
They cut jobs
while she was pregnant.

39:20.780 --> 39:22.305
I got her back in.

39:22.660 --> 39:25.664
He's been very grateful to me
ever since.

39:25.940 --> 39:29.308
Who'll take you on again at 43?

39:30.020 --> 39:31.784
People should help each other.

39:32.180 --> 39:35.707
My position won me many enemies,

39:35.940 --> 39:38.546
but also many friends!

39:39.500 --> 39:41.150
Could I have another drop?

39:42.620 --> 39:44.145
Good, isn't it?

39:55.500 --> 39:56.661
Is something wrong?

39:56.940 --> 39:58.066
No. Why?

39:58.260 --> 40:00.069
You're here? At this hour?

40:01.100 --> 40:03.546
I wanted to say sorry for earlier.

40:10.060 --> 40:11.471
The neighbors are watching.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.025
So what?

40:14.020 --> 40:15.351
How's Eliza?

40:16.060 --> 40:17.266
Not good.

40:17.660 --> 40:18.900
She didn't do well.

40:19.060 --> 40:20.630
- On her test?
- Yes.

40:22.540 --> 40:23.587
I'm sorry.

40:24.060 --> 40:24.902
Yes.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.189
I wanted to ask you.

40:28.620 --> 40:32.750
Could they let her write
a bit more once the 3 hours are up?

40:33.580 --> 40:34.911
Not really.

40:35.940 --> 40:36.702
I see.

40:38.220 --> 40:41.144
Well, then I don't know.
We'll see.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.191
<i>'Ms is Mam.</i>

40:47.540 --> 40:50.225
Dr. Aldea, who operated on Mum...

40:50.780 --> 40:52.111
Hello, Matei.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.981
Matei, will you take that mask off?

40:57.500 --> 40:58.581
Let him be.

40:59.140 --> 41:00.665
I'll be going.

41:00.860 --> 41:01.986
Bye, Matei.

41:08.420 --> 41:10.661
Do you mind that I introduced you?

41:10.860 --> 41:12.544
No, why should I?

41:13.100 --> 41:14.784
You didn't want to meet him.

41:15.300 --> 41:16.506
You didn't want it.

41:17.940 --> 41:20.591
But now I thought you should meet.

41:21.100 --> 41:22.181
So we've met.

41:23.340 --> 41:24.785
I have to go.

41:26.140 --> 41:27.141
Go, then.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.109
The light attracts the moths.

41:53.300 --> 41:54.631
Don't worry.

41:54.820 --> 41:57.221
- Do you want some cake?
- No, thanks.

41:57.500 --> 41:58.990
Homemade, by my wife.

41:59.180 --> 42:02.024
I've bothered you enough already.

42:02.340 --> 42:03.626
It happens.

42:04.700 --> 42:06.987
Happy birthday to your wife.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.187
I'll tell her.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.986
- Can I get you a chair?
- Don't bother.

42:12.940 --> 42:15.420
Forgive me for this morning.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.509
If I seemed a bit aggressive...

42:17.700 --> 42:19.031
Don't worry.

42:19.340 --> 42:21.229
Now, how may I help you?

42:21.860 --> 42:24.909
Mr. Bulai described the situation,
I believe.

42:25.340 --> 42:26.626
Yes, he did.

42:27.180 --> 42:29.103
What grade does the girl need?

42:29.540 --> 42:31.622
She needs a final average of 9

42:31.820 --> 42:33.310
to get the scholarship.

42:33.700 --> 42:35.270
And on the Romanian test?

42:35.460 --> 42:37.428
We estimate an 8 at most.

42:37.940 --> 42:39.305
Have you spoken to anybody?

42:39.500 --> 42:43.027
For the Romanian test? No.
Could we change anything?

42:43.580 --> 42:45.628
It might be a bit late now.

42:46.660 --> 42:49.504
There are teachers
from different schools.

42:49.780 --> 42:54.263
I'm very sorry to involve you.
It's very unpleasant.

42:54.460 --> 42:55.905
Such things happen.

42:56.180 --> 42:58.023
What are her grades in maths?

42:58.220 --> 43:02.145
Her final average
at the end of high school is 9.6.

43:02.340 --> 43:03.580
That's good.

43:04.700 --> 43:07.226
So she could get 10 in the exam.

43:07.700 --> 43:09.543
I think so, yes.

43:10.940 --> 43:13.671
I don't know one of the grading teachers.

43:13.860 --> 43:17.228
The other one was a colleague.
A decent man.

43:17.420 --> 43:18.910
But we need both of them.

43:19.060 --> 43:21.108
I don't know how such things work.

43:21.300 --> 43:25.749
They must give similar grades. If not,
the paper goes to another committee.

43:25.940 --> 43:28.511
- It's better not to.
- I see.

43:28.820 --> 43:30.151
So what's best?

43:31.380 --> 43:33.781
I'll see in the morning

43:34.100 --> 43:37.821
or I'll try taking the paper
to another teacher.

43:38.020 --> 43:40.148
But that's a bit more complicated.

43:40.540 --> 43:42.144
Is that the only way?

43:42.540 --> 43:44.349
Do you know of any other?

43:45.300 --> 43:47.906
Please tell me what I have to do.

43:48.300 --> 43:50.701
- How much I should pay.
- Nothing.

43:50.940 --> 43:53.625
Mr. Bulai helped me,
I help you, that's all.

43:53.820 --> 43:55.902
I'll be greatly in your debt.

43:56.380 --> 43:58.303
Could I compensate you somehow...

43:58.500 --> 44:01.231
Don't worry about it, it's fine.

44:01.580 --> 44:03.742
Just make sure the girl

44:03.940 --> 44:05.624
marks her paper clearly.

44:06.940 --> 44:08.544
I need to talk to her?

44:08.740 --> 44:10.742
Yes. She must mark the paper.

44:10.940 --> 44:13.181
If we miss it, it's over.

44:13.660 --> 44:14.741
I see.

44:15.580 --> 44:20.461
All she has to do is cross out
<i>3</i> words on the first page, bottom line.

44:20.700 --> 44:22.065
The last <i>3</i> words.

44:23.620 --> 44:24.701
Just like this.

44:25.460 --> 44:26.950
- Understood?
- Yes.

44:31.260 --> 44:33.149
OK. Well, thank you.

44:33.340 --> 44:36.787
I'll go. I've disturbed
your wife's birthday long enough.

44:37.020 --> 44:39.910
Doctor, if you have any doubts,
say so now.

44:40.060 --> 44:42.711
This can only work on trust.

44:42.940 --> 44:46.069
I don't want to end up in the news.
Neither do you.

44:46.260 --> 44:47.910
That won't happen.

44:48.060 --> 44:52.110
One more thing:
I'm doing this for the girl.

44:52.380 --> 44:56.066
She shouldn't pay
because we can't handle our criminals.

44:56.740 --> 44:58.549
But I don't do such things.

44:59.140 --> 45:02.349
This house and all you see here
was earned honestly.

45:02.620 --> 45:03.746
I'm sure.

45:04.580 --> 45:05.991
I don't do such things.

45:06.180 --> 45:07.261
I don't doubt it.

45:08.980 --> 45:11.062
I'll see you out.
Some cake?

45:11.260 --> 45:12.671
No, thank you.

47:43.100 --> 47:47.503
Once she starts on this path,
there's no going back.

47:47.820 --> 47:51.506
You can't just shake it off,
say it's OK and move on.

47:51.780 --> 47:55.182
You know in your heart of hearts
that it's not right.

47:55.860 --> 47:58.989
That's not the path
I want Eliza to take in life.

47:59.180 --> 48:00.830
I'm sure you don't either.

48:03.460 --> 48:07.624
If there was any other way,
I wouldn't even think about it.

48:08.780 --> 48:10.908
She shouldn't be doing this.

48:12.780 --> 48:13.941
Magda.

48:14.820 --> 48:18.029
We raised her knowing
she'd leave here.

48:18.260 --> 48:20.228
What if she misses this chance?

48:20.420 --> 48:23.230
She can't handle life here.

48:23.860 --> 48:25.350
She'll learn.

48:26.100 --> 48:30.105
We were just as unprepared
at her age. We handled it.

48:30.300 --> 48:31.381
Did we?

48:32.020 --> 48:33.909
How did we handle it?

48:34.220 --> 48:36.985
By doing things
we wanted her not to do?

48:37.820 --> 48:40.585
But how could she start off in life

48:40.780 --> 48:43.511
with this burden on her shoulders?

48:43.940 --> 48:45.590
What burden, Magda?

48:45.780 --> 48:47.782
This exam's just a formality.

48:47.980 --> 48:50.267
Everyone cheats in their final exam.

48:50.620 --> 48:52.031
I didn't cheat.

48:52.340 --> 48:54.229
Fine, Magda, you didn't.

48:54.780 --> 48:58.182
Anyway, this exam
makes no difference in the end.

48:58.420 --> 49:00.991
Even what they studied in school
is useless.

49:01.460 --> 49:04.703
All that counts is getting
to a normal world.

49:04.940 --> 49:08.023
How you get there matters too.

49:08.540 --> 49:10.144
It's not fair to-

49:10.340 --> 49:14.550
Being attacked in broad daylight
in a crowded place, is that fair?

49:14.940 --> 49:16.669
You want her to live here?

49:16.860 --> 49:19.261
- It was an accident.
- No, it wasn't!

49:19.700 --> 49:22.909
You ended up in some library
because you were fair!

49:23.260 --> 49:25.911
Sometimes the result
is all that matters.

49:26.260 --> 49:29.150
It's our decision,
she needn't feel guilty.

49:29.340 --> 49:32.822
This isn't something
you can decide for her.

49:33.060 --> 49:34.585
So what's your plan?

49:36.540 --> 49:37.701
I don't know.

49:38.180 --> 49:39.705
You know what annoys me?

49:40.820 --> 49:44.302
That you know
there's no other way.

49:44.500 --> 49:47.231
But you won't take any responsibility,

49:47.420 --> 49:49.070
knowing that I'll fix it.

49:49.260 --> 49:53.663
No, but I'm aware that being fair
comes with a price.

49:53.940 --> 49:55.749
And I was willing to pay it.

49:56.180 --> 50:00.549
You could afford to
because I took care of everything!

50:00.980 --> 50:04.302
I'd pay any price in this situation,
if it was about me.

50:04.700 --> 50:07.021
But I won't have my child pay it.

50:07.220 --> 50:08.745
She's my child, too.

50:09.060 --> 50:09.982
Is she?

50:10.940 --> 50:13.068
Fine, then you go talk to her.

50:23.740 --> 50:24.582
Come in.

50:27.940 --> 50:30.147
Are you all right?

50:30.540 --> 50:34.067
Yes, just reading this synopsis.

50:37.660 --> 50:39.344
How did it go with Marius?

50:41.380 --> 50:42.461
OK.

50:43.300 --> 50:45.064
It'll all pass, you'll see.

50:47.140 --> 50:48.141
Yeah.

50:50.140 --> 50:52.586
When you're in Kensington Gardens,

50:52.780 --> 50:56.341
with all those squirrels chasing you,

50:56.980 --> 51:00.063
the world here will seem so far away,

51:00.260 --> 51:02.911
you'll wonder if it was real.

51:04.220 --> 51:05.381
Don't say that.

51:07.940 --> 51:09.988
Do you think it's easy for us?

51:11.340 --> 51:12.751
But that's life.

51:13.620 --> 51:17.261
Children leave home
and learn to live on their own.

51:19.620 --> 51:23.102
Don't be angry
if I don't do well in the exam tomorrow.

51:23.780 --> 51:24.827
Eliza,

51:26.380 --> 51:30.783
you have to do your best.
It'd be a pity to miss this chance.

51:33.060 --> 51:36.587
Some important steps in life
depend on small things.

51:37.740 --> 51:40.186
And some chances shouldn't be wasted.

51:42.180 --> 51:46.902
You know, in '91,
your Mum and I decided to move back.

51:47.180 --> 51:48.466
It was a bad decision.

51:49.580 --> 51:54.063
We thought things would change,
we thought we'd move mountains.

51:55.180 --> 51:56.784
We didn't move anything.

51:57.380 --> 51:59.189
I have no regrets, though.

51:59.700 --> 52:01.225
At least we tried.

52:02.780 --> 52:05.909
But don't make a mistake now
just because we did.

52:06.100 --> 52:09.991
If you do, it means
we lived for nothing, understand?

52:18.460 --> 52:19.541
What's that?

52:21.940 --> 52:24.671
A precaution for tomorrow's exam.

52:25.860 --> 52:29.990
You need to do your best.
I'm sure this won't be necessary.

52:30.180 --> 52:31.944
But we can't risk

52:32.140 --> 52:35.269
you missing this train
for fractions of a point.

52:39.780 --> 52:41.225
I don't understand.

52:43.100 --> 52:47.071
You just have to cross out
<i>3</i> words from the first page.

52:47.580 --> 52:50.982
Just like here.
Regardless of the questions.

52:51.780 --> 52:53.305
Now do you understand?

52:57.940 --> 52:59.271
Eliza...

53:00.860 --> 53:04.182
Sometimes, in life,
it's the result that counts.

53:04.980 --> 53:06.903
Don't get me wrong.

53:08.700 --> 53:12.261
We raised you to always be honest.

53:13.140 --> 53:15.188
But this is the world we live in.

53:15.580 --> 53:19.221
And sometimes we need to fight
using their weapons.

53:20.820 --> 53:25.189
So this is a precaution
that gets you where you want to go,

53:25.420 --> 53:26.831
where you deserve to go.

53:28.140 --> 53:32.145
From there,
you can do what you think is best.

53:33.860 --> 53:36.147
- What I think is best?
- Yes.

53:37.220 --> 53:41.270
Trust me, if there was any way
of changing things here,

53:41.460 --> 53:44.145
I'd urge you to stay and fight.

53:44.940 --> 53:47.511
But it's enough that we stayed.

53:48.500 --> 53:51.470
Let others try too,
we've done our bit.

53:53.940 --> 53:55.351
What does Mum say?

53:56.940 --> 54:01.264
I think she understands
that life has its winners and losers.

54:02.220 --> 54:04.905
And we want you to be a winner.

54:06.220 --> 54:09.542
And have a good life,
since you won't get another.

54:23.300 --> 54:25.302
I'll let you rest now.

54:32.980 --> 54:35.824
Put on some socks.
Don't catch cold.

54:39.260 --> 54:40.546
Goodnight.

54:43.500 --> 54:46.470
You can smoke,
I know you have some there.

55:39.940 --> 55:40.827
Dad?

55:41.020 --> 55:41.942
Yes?

55:44.340 --> 55:46.581
Why do you always beep here?

55:48.300 --> 55:49.790
Just to make sure.

55:52.660 --> 55:54.981
Even when there are no cars?

56:09.300 --> 56:10.381
Want some water?

56:10.620 --> 56:11.348
No.

56:11.540 --> 56:13.030
Did you bring your snack?

56:13.340 --> 56:14.182
Yes.

56:14.940 --> 56:17.307
Eat. It helps the brain.

56:31.260 --> 56:33.501
Good luck. And take care.

56:36.220 --> 56:38.541
- Could you rewind?
- Of course.

56:43.700 --> 56:46.510
A mountain ranger
saw one of the convicts

56:46.700 --> 56:48.589
near the chairlift.

56:48.780 --> 56:50.828
Tomorrow we'll search for him.

56:52.740 --> 56:56.222
That cyclist says he didn't understand
what was going on.

56:58.100 --> 56:59.909
This other one didn't, either?

57:00.100 --> 57:01.511
Every man for himself.

57:02.300 --> 57:04.382
What's the world coming to?

57:05.540 --> 57:06.780
Pause it for a moment!

57:12.220 --> 57:14.587
Can you print me a screenshot?

57:15.060 --> 57:16.266
What for?

57:16.700 --> 57:18.031
Can you?

57:18.420 --> 57:21.503
Sandu, print that
for Lieutenant Bullitt here.

57:21.820 --> 57:23.549
Draw the blinds.

57:25.780 --> 57:26.747
Hello.

57:26.940 --> 57:28.749
- Got the convict?
- Tomorrow.

57:28.940 --> 57:30.669
- Heard about the accident?
- No.

57:30.860 --> 57:33.989
30 minutes ago, by the bridge.
Head-on collision.

57:34.180 --> 57:37.229
<i>3</i> men and one woman dead,
one man in a coma.

57:37.500 --> 57:38.786
- Were you there?
- No.

57:38.980 --> 57:43.588
My brother's a funeral director,
pays ambulance drivers to tip him off.

57:44.020 --> 57:45.101
It's come to that...

57:45.500 --> 57:46.626
Law of the jungle.

57:47.220 --> 57:49.791
There's a lot of competition, sir.

57:50.020 --> 57:51.181
Here it is.

57:52.740 --> 57:53.901
Thank you.

57:54.180 --> 57:55.784
Any news for my godfather?

57:55.980 --> 57:57.027
<i>Gem'.!</i>

57:57.220 --> 57:58.301
Not yet.

58:01.100 --> 58:03.307
- I'm off.
- We'll keep you informed.

58:03.540 --> 58:04.746
Goodbye.

58:27.100 --> 58:28.704
Hi, Csilla, what's up?

58:28.940 --> 58:31.261
Car crash. Came in an hour ago,

58:31.460 --> 58:32.461
in a coma.

58:33.260 --> 58:34.671
Mr. Bulai is waiting.

58:34.860 --> 58:35.986
How is he?

58:36.260 --> 58:37.910
Not too spry, you'll see.

58:38.260 --> 58:39.944
Get his colonoscopy.

58:40.140 --> 58:41.744
I have it ready for you.

58:43.100 --> 58:44.101
Thanks.

58:47.260 --> 58:50.946
The liver doesn't worry me so much,
I knew what to expect.

58:51.140 --> 58:53.620
- This, however, does.
- What?

58:53.980 --> 58:55.584
These polyps here.

58:56.020 --> 59:00.105
Possibly the cause of your condition.
We must remove them first.

59:00.340 --> 59:03.469
No, doctor...
This is terrible news!

59:03.660 --> 59:06.345
No need to panic.
Good thing we saw them.

59:06.540 --> 59:09.669
We'll run tests
and solve the problem.

59:10.940 --> 59:12.908
- Thank you so much-
- What's this?

59:13.100 --> 59:15.182
- Please accept it.
- We agreed...

59:15.380 --> 59:16.950
Don't you trust me?

59:17.140 --> 59:20.906
I do. But one can't have
an operation without paying.

59:21.100 --> 59:24.627
- You're embarrassing me-
- Not at all.

59:24.860 --> 59:28.262
Take it as a heartfelt gift.
It's for my peace of mind.

59:30.300 --> 59:33.110
Mr. Bulai,
I need my peace of mind too.

59:33.300 --> 59:35.746
So this stays here.
After the surgery,

59:35.940 --> 59:37.510
we talk and see. Deal?

59:38.660 --> 59:42.142
If only...
If I ever wake up from it!

59:42.340 --> 59:47.471
Mr. Bulai, please, it's essential
that you keep a positive outlook!

59:47.660 --> 59:50.186
My life is in your hands now.

59:50.380 --> 59:52.906
Everything will be fine, don't worry!

59:53.100 --> 59:54.625
I pray to God it will be!

59:54.940 --> 59:56.988
OK, enough of this!

59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.424
Have things worked out
with your daughter?

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.227
I spoke with him, yes.
Thank you.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.070
He's a kind man.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:10.548
Yes. He understood
it was difficult for me too.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.903
Misfortunes occur. Unpredictably.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.830
It could have been worse.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.420
Still, it's hard.

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:21.062
You don't know what's best.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.905
That's the hard part.

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.947
But if you do something earnestly,
with all your heart,

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.705
you needn't doubt yourself.

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:29.941
You think so?

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:32.268
I don't think so, I'm sure.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.349
Please, go, go!

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.342
Yes.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:47.902
Hello.

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:49.582
Hello.

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:51.430
I'm Eliza's father.

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.824
We met at the motorcycling school.

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:55.987
Oh, right.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.263
Excuse me, I'm...
I didn't sleep last night.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.343
- You were busy.
- Yes.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:05.381
I d] in a club
for some extra money, so...

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.225
Everything OK with Eliza?

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:10.151
It's OK.
She can steer one-handed now.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:13.226
We'll have to cancel the exam, right?

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.228
Yes.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:17.185
- Was it on Thursday?
- It won't be possible.

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:22.062
- Are you waiting for her?
- Yes, I promised I would.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.589
It's taking so long today...

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:29.228
Yes. Finals have got
so complicated lately.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.184
Me, I was out in 1 hour.

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.427
<i>'Rwy':
Ahâ€œ!</i>

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.989
Truth is, we were organized.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.546
What school was it?

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:39.108
The Sports School, if you know it.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.821
- Behind the-
- By the train station.

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:44.462
What do you mean "organized"?

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.147
Our specialty was sport,

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:51.902
so the teachers were flexible.
The reputation of the school counts.

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.586
I see.
So they let you cheat.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:58.780
We had access to some sources
of inspiration, Romanian's hard...

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:02.541
With so much training,
we had little time to study.

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.188
You want a degree in sports?

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:10.911
If Eliza went to Uni in Clui,
I could try something there.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.587
But given the new situation...
we'll see.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.149
She'll go to England.
The scholarship's a big chance.

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.751
Of course.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.586
Marius, I wanted to ask you something.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:23.702
Go ahead.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.343
The day Eliza was attacked,

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:30.147
she said you were going to meet.
Could you tell me

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.830
what happened?

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.305
I was supposed to be there at 1:50.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.344
But the bus didn't come.
I mean, it was late.

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:40.951
So when I arrived,

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.269
Eliza wasn't there,
where we usually meet.

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.066
I see. Did you call her?

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:49.786
Of course I did, only it didn't...

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:52.301
she didn't answer.
It wasn't ringing.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.748
- So, she didn't answer.
- No.

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.466
Probably...
Or it didn't get through at all?

01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:01.221
Yes. You can imagine how I fell
when I found out.

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:05.220
If I'd got there
5 minutes earlier, who knows?

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.543
You considered calling the police?

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.744
I didn't worry.
I thought she'd gone into school.

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.989
- Without waiting for you?
- Well, as I was late...

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:17.219
I ask because somebody
called the police.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:17.391
I ask because somebody
called the police.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:20.546
Could be.
Did you get the number?

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.663
A prepaid SIM.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.306
I see.

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:26.271
There's Eliza now.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.464
- How did it go?
- Fine.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.509
- Tired?
- A bit.

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:35.906
Shall Hake you home?

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:39.348
I'll hang around a bit in town,
get some air.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.790
Did it go well?

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:43.666
It did.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.949
I'll get back by myself, OK?

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.786
Be careful on that...

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.822
I will.

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:47.939
Mum, I asked you <i>2</i> things:

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:49.101
Mum, I asked you <i>2</i> things:

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.299
to let him buy bread by himself
and not to sleep with him.

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.950
To let him buy bread by himself
and not to sleep with him.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.104
Yes, I know it's not easy for him,
I know.

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.627
Neither is raising him alone.

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.107
No, Mum, you're helping me
if you follow my rules.

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:06.659
It does matter,
I don't want to raise a mummy's boy!

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:09.630
It does matter,
I don't want to raise a mummy's boy!

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.622
I'll call you later, OK?

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.551
Yes, bye.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.944
Listen to this.

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.348
I went today to Micii Campioni.

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:22.499
<i>â€œMicii Campioni?</i>

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:22.989
<i>â€œMicii Campioni?</i>

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:25.547
The English school.
Forgotten already?

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.629
You called it "Little Champions".

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.142
I say: I'm here to enroll my boy
for this autumn.

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:34.310
We're full up, she says.
I couldn't even finish!

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.584
I say: The enrollment period
hasn't even started!

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:38.339
So she tells me about
siblings having priority,

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:41.230
So she tells me about
siblings having priority,

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.627
children who live locally
and so on.

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:45.221
It's a private school?

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.900
State. But with extra English.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.501
Get him into your school. Simpler.

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.699
I want him to start being
more independent.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:54.110
I want him to start being
more independent.

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:57.384
- They knew about his speech problems?
- Yes.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:00.948
That's it. Or maybe they wanted
a little pay-off?

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.944
Why? It's a public school!

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:06.429
I spoke with the headmistress,
he'll take a test.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.539
But his speech problems
must be treated.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:10.541
But his speech problems
must be treated.

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.627
Yes.

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:13.910
So could you help me?

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:17.507
Yes, as soon as l finish
with Eliza's exams.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.584
It'll be too late.
The school will be full.

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.182
He needs a speech therapist,
it's not that easy.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.379
I know.
That's why I asked you.

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.506
I know.
That's why I asked you.

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:31.141
Sorry, but I can't really focus
on anything else.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.782
If Eliza fails to leave now...

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:35.141
You can imagine...

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.219
I know Eliza's always
your top priority.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.301
I know Eliza's always
your top priority.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.026
But it's never the right time
for me.

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.149
Something always comes up.

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.627
I can't go on like this, Romeo.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.269
I need to take some decisions
about my life.

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:56.579
I'm 35, I can't hang around
waiting for... what?

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:56.671
I'm 35, I can't hang around
waiting for... what?

01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:59.148
I need to be sure
of some things.

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:02.503
You always avoid
making plans or clear decisions.

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:05.261
What clear decisions have I avoided?

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:09.145
What decisions, Romeo?
Don't you know?

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.419
Meeting in secret for over a year
suits you?

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:12.750
Meeting in secret for over a year
suits you?

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:15.022
Or that I sleep alone here?

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:16.904
While you sleep at home?

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:19.149
I sleep in the living room!

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:22.624
And I've never hidden
my situation from you.

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:27.742
Yes, but we can't keep up
this uncertainty, this lie.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:28.259
I don't want to lie to my child.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.149
I don't want to lie to my child.

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:33.264
Who asked you to lie to him, Sandra?

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:37.023
Matei and I didn't meet
until you wanted us to,

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.507
and when you wanted us to, we did.

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:41.430
I don't see why,

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.619
given what happened to us,
you come up with all this.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.224
Given what happened to us,
you come up with all this.

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.224
Given what happened to whom?

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:50.424
To you and your family?

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.348
Does what happens to me matter?

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:56.265
Or does it matter less, or later?

01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:58.787
If you have time,
or when you feel like it?

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.587
Is he here?

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:12.821
He is.

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.749
Romeo, it's for you.

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.149
Grandma collapsed.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.062
Eliza!

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:26.145
Eliza, wait!

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:46.265
Park Street 62, yes.

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:46.499
Why is she there?

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.661
Why is she there?

01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:49.988
She fell going to the bathroom.

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:51.710
Why isn't she in bed?

01:08:51.979 --> 01:08:53.663
We were afraid to move her.

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:55.464
Help me get her into bed.

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.464
The stethoscope!
In the closet!

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.350
Got her? Up!

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.339
Take that jar away, please.

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:03.580
Take that jar away, please.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:08.060
- You called the ambulance?
- No.

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:09.671
I did, just now.

01:09:09.859 --> 01:09:11.305
Open that window!

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.901
- The bathroom window's open.
- It's OK.

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.629
Good Lord!
She was fine at noon and...

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:18.179
Quiet!

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.180
Quiet!

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.819
Pass me her medicine,

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.102
the Cavinton. It's over there.

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:26.301
Hurry "P!

01:09:31.779 --> 01:09:33.538
Good. Keep her head tilted.

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:33.904
Good. Keep her head tilted.

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.950
Turn on the light.

01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:40.504
Do you know what she ate?

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.943
I brought some beans.
And a pickled cucumber.

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:46.541
But she didn't even touch the cucumber.

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.379
I told you:
no more salty, bloating food.

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.029
I told you:
no more salty, bloating food.

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:52.786
There were hardly 3 spoonfuls there.

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.184
Put her feet up a bit.

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:01.666
What's wrong?

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:04.101
- The rubbing alcohol.
- It's there.

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:05.219
The bottom one!

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:05.630
The bottom one!

01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:08.071
Come on, Mum!

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.266
Is it serious?

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:14.227
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:15.626
It's not that bad.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.906
Keep pressing.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.579
It's the ambulance crew, sir.

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:20.944
It's the ambulance crew, sir.

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:23.461
Good evening.

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:25.821
I'm her son.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.227
Aldea.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:28.741
I'm a doctor.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.944
She has a heart condition
and fainting spells.

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.940
Her heart.
And intracranial hypertension.

01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:38.271
In her head, yes.

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:41.831
No, it's in a more difficult area.

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.740
We don't know yet.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:44.748
Dad!

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.427
I'll call from my phone in a moment.

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.464
No, she'll wake up.

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.424
I gave her a shot.

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:54.908
As you wish. Yes.

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.745
What's this, Mum?

01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:58.625
Do you want to scare us?

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.825
Let's go, it's late.

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:11.427
I'm staying.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.189
Eliza, Grandma's OK now.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.901
What's intracranial hypertension?

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:22.661
It's a sort of pressure on the brain.

01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:23.459
Depending on the area,
it can cause these episodes.

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.906
Depending on the area,
it can cause these episodes.

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:28.629
- Is it serious?
- Serious...

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.665
We'll see how it develops.

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:32.350
Why didn't you tell us?

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:33.780
Tell you what?

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:35.709
For now, she's fine.

01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:37.624
And I'll take care of it.

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.190
How was the exam, today?

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.468
Good. The questions were easy.

01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:46.341
Good.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.222
Let's go, you'll be tired tomorrow.

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.346
Why don't you answer?

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.139
I'll call back later.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:55.982
I'll call back later.

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.346
Your phone was on silent
when I called.

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.110
I was in surgery.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.267
Dad...

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:05.702
I want you to talk to Mum.

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:07.021
Eliza,

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:10.499
what Mum and I
have to discuss is our business.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:10.910
What Mum and I
have to discuss is our business.

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.101
No, Dad.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.907
Don't think I can go home
like nothing happened.

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.304
Please go and talk to her.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.548
Please, get your things.

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:21.662
- No, Dad.
- Eliza!

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:22.543
No!

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.910
Talk to her
or I won't sit the exam tomorrow.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:26.339
Excuse me?

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.421
Excuse me?

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.340
I'm sorry.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:32.350
I didn't mean it.

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:33.902
But...

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:38.266
please do it.
Go and talk to her tonight.

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.387
You think you can blackmail me?

01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:46.786
Eliza! You think you're doing
this exam for me?

01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:48.425
Or for your mother?

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:51.301
You think you're doing us a favour?

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.791
I jump through hoops for you
and you do this?

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:57.108
I never asked you to jump through-

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:57.539
No, you didn't.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.666
No, you didn't.

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:02.911
But did you ask for any of the things
I always did for you?

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.671
Or did I just do them?

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:08.146
Can you even imagine

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.469
what we had to do
so you can live like this?

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:17.068
You shouldn't have done it
if it wasn't right.

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:21.302
It's so easy to say
"you shouldn't have done it".

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.466
Would you be going to study in the UK

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.947
without all the private lessons

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.219
or the competitions you were in?

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:29.425
Or the competitions you were in?

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.827
I hope you didn't rig those, too.

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:34.910
What? How can you say that?

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:40.267
How could you do this to Mum?

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.668
That's really not your business.

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:48.911
You know,
we made this effort for you.

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.704
So you wouldn't suffer.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.306
I don't want to go to the UK anymore.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.423
I want to stay here with Marius.

01:13:58.820 --> 01:13:59.901
Really?

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:00.419
Very well then.

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.387
Very well then.

01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.589
Go get a job,
see how the real world is.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:09.183
But in 10 years
you might regret it.

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.030
It'll be too late.

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:14.427
- The lady needs the bathroom.
- OK.

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.584
Sleep here if you want.

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:20.709
I'll pick you up at 7.

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.385
Marius will take me.

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:26.667
Easy, Mum.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:31.586
There now, dear.
I'm not dead yet.

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.341
Can you manage?

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:38.826
<i>Yes, dear.</i>

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.027
Hi, Magda.

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.142
Hello.

01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:15.502
Come in.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:20.587
What's wrong?

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:24.668
Grandma collapsed
and Eliza got scared.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.590
She's staying over.

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:29.147
- Is she OK now?
- She's better, yes.

01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:32.664
How did she do in the exam?

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.588
I don't know, she didn't say.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.748
She came to find me at Sandra's.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.430
She was afraid Grandma would die
so she came.

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:53.711
You were at Sandra's?

01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:54.827
Yes.

01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.428
How did she know you were there?

01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.466
I don't know.

01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:04.910
And what did you tell her?

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:06.985
Nothing.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.901
I promised her I'd talk to you.

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:18.631
You shouldn't have influenced her grade.

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:21.066
After that,

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:24.705
what does all we've taught her
count for?

01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.584
The same as before.

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:29.264
But not here.

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.183
I'll follow her.

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:38.907
Where?

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.746
Anywhere.

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.029
Wherever she goes,

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:46.031
I'll go too.

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:49.788
Have you asked what she thinks?

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.060
I won't be in her way.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.102
I'll cook for her...

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.190
I'll wait for her at home...

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:58.626
In the student dorm?

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.710
We'll rent somewhere.

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.471
With what?

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.580
We'll rent out this place,

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:10.790
or sell it.

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.421
Even if Eliza hadn't found out,

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:22.226
it was time for you to move.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.183
Isn't this my home too?

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:29.264
Not for a long time.

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:34.988
Once Eliza leaves, you're free

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.667
to rebuild your life
with anyone you wish.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.063
Rebuild what?

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.784
That no longer concerns me.

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:48.981
Just know that, whether Eliza
goes to the UK or to Cluj,

01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:51.828
you can't stay here anymore.

01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:57.749
May I ask you something?

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:02.102
Talk to Eliza,
get her to do the exam tomorrow.

01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:04.226
Won't you drive her?

01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:06.624
She said Marius would.

01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:10.667
Fine.

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:17.025
But you stop sleeping here
from tonight.

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.668
I need to tell Eliza something.

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:26.907
OK.

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:17.706
They're doing the grille
tomorrow.

01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:19.946
I'll deal with it.

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:24.271
Goodnight.

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.666
Goodnight.

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.790
- Morning.
- Hello, Elena.

01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:14.301
Csilla wants
to see you urgently.

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.628
- She's here?
- She was called in.

01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:17.901
Why?

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:20.062
She'll explain.
Coffee's ready.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.466
Thank you.

01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:25.423
- Is today the last exam?
- Yes, the last one.

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.509
- How's Eliza?
- Better.

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.350
God bless her.

01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:30.587
Thank you.

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.581
What's going on?

01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:36.145
Some prosecutors are here.

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:37.182
Why?

01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:39.269
There's a warrant for Mr. Bulai.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:42.907
The intern forbade them to see him
before you came.

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:46.189
- Why didn't you call me?
- Do you ever answer?

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.264
How is Bulai feeling?

01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:51.350
Not so good, doctor.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.068
- You offered them coffee?
- Yes.

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.302
Check if Eliza got to the exam.

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.070
- OK.
- Thank you.

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:01.701
Your car keys.
I'm taking it to be fixed.

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.789
Best of luck, doctor.

01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:06.300
Thank you, Csilla.

01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:16.546
Good morning.

01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:17.827
Good morning.

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:21.340
Ivascu, Public Prosecutor's office.

01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.144
My colleague, Mr. Albu.

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:25.820
- How may I help?
- Do you have a minute?

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.465
I have my rounds.

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:29.822
Still, sit.
We need to clarify a few things.

01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:31.067
It won't take long.

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:38.666
I'm listening.

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.028
You know Mr. Alexandru Bulai?

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:42.665
He was admitted here.

01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:43.747
Of course I do.

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:46.341
- How well?
- Not that well.

01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:50.704
I don't mean you're friends
but you've met him before?

01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:54.626
Sorry, but could you tell me
what this is about?

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:58.751
Mr. Bulai is facing criminal charges

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:01.711
regarding his function
<i>as</i> customs chief,

01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:04.671
as well as other aspects
of his work.

01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:06.100
I see.

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.267
And?

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:10.066
We'd like to discuss
some issues with him,

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:13.389
but his lawyer claims he's unfit.

01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:14.741
Medically unfit.

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.351
He is very ill.

01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:20.063
He'll die if he doesn't get
a liver very quickly.

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:22.827
And even then, his situation is...

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:26.744
I see.
So what do you recommend?

01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.586
Do you think
he could stand detention?

01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:32.306
Right now, it's out of the question.

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:34.660
But a talk?

01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:36.350
Is that also too much?

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:38.590
Depends on how long it is.

01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:42.145
Tell me,

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.702
would a medical commission

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:47.147
reach the same conclusion?

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:51.305
I presume so,
but since we live in Romania...

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:55.744
Doctors sometimes protect patients
for bad reasons...

01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:57.823
Listen...

01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:02.106
You see a mote in your brother's eye
but not the beam in your own.

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:04.541
Could you be more specific?

01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:07.989
You have the reputation

01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.143
of being an honest doctor.

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.822
You don't ask patients for incentives,
as some others do.

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.182
You're free to search my office-

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:18.542
There's no need for that,

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.670
and anyway, we'd need a warrant.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:23.786
But you know...

01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:26.589
Everyone has his weak spot.

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:28.710
I'm not sure I follow.

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:32.307
In very complex investigations,

01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:35.783
certain procedures are followed,
do you understand?

01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:40.782
Depending on the findings,
the charges can be extended.

01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:44.903
Influence peddling,
incitement and so on.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.785
So the suspect's calls
are intercepted.

01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:49.141
Do you understand?

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:53.904
If any kind of fraud is suspected,
further investigations follow.

01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:57.269
We know you had some conversations
with Mr. Bulai.

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:01.984
I greatly admire you, professionally.

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.944
And, though I may be
out of line here,

01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:09.383
I'm sure my colleague here
and you above all

01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:12.265
will keep this conversation confidential.

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:14.586
In brief,

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:18.070
everything you discussed
with Mr. Bulai

01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:20.501
has been recorded and filed.

01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:24.827
I see.

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:29.709
Excuse me if I'm being too blunt,

01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:33.747
we're giving you the chance
to correct your mistakes.

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:36.944
"Errare humanum est",
as the Romans used to say.

01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:40.542
You have mitigating circumstances.
We have children too.

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:43.823
We don't know
what we'd have done in your place.

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:45.625
But the law's the law.

01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:47.709
He who persists in illegality

01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:50.591
will probably have to pay for it.

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:53.950
As for Mr. Bulai,
with your permission,

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:56.666
we'd still like to talk to him today,

01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:58.589
ask him a few questions.

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:04.904
That won't be possible.

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:06.027
Why?

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:12.027
Because I can't do that.
I hope you understand.

01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:17.501
I'm very sorry to hear that, doctor.

01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:19.785
I do understand.

01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:23.388
And I respect your decision.

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.827
But I think you should reconsider.

01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:30.465
These investigations
can be very unpleasant.

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:33.510
For your daughter too,
even if it's not her fault.

01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:36.264
You're here at 10 tomorrow?

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:38.662
Tomorrow and any other day.

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.144
Then we'll see you tomorrow.

01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:43.907
Goodbye.

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.909
Think about it.

01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:49.381
Sometimes it helps to sleep on it.

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.066
If I may ask,

01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:53.910
just out of curiosity...

01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:56.110
Are these real?

01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:57.821
Yes.

01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:59.670
Then my colleague was wrong.

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:02.066
Have a nice day.

01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:56.949
What did the morticians want?

01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:58.944
Don't worry, it's OK.

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:00.670
Were they prosecutors?

01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.829
Yes, but they're not after us.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:06.071
They're after
this patient of mine, Bulai.

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:08.902
They'll see, when they end up here.

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:10.785
They're doing their job.

01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:14.223
If they'd done it on time,
we wouldn't be here.

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:18.229
They're young.
Maybe they'll make things better.

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:19.581
How?

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.942
Besides, it's too late for us.

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.788
It is, but what can we do?

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:28.184
Let me know if I can help.

01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:34.348
Can you handle things here?
I have something to do.

01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.585
Sure, doctor, go.

01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:37.906
And be careful.

01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:39.266
I will.

01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:41.107
Thanks.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:48.987
Inspector!

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.942
There's someone here to see you.

01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:09.311
Hey. How are you?

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:11.506
How do you think?

01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:15.540
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:16.981
I know you didn't.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.980
The thing is, my child is involved.

01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:25.708
You really need to talk to her.

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.505
Talk about what?

01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:30.909
You need your stories to match.

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:32.989
How could I do such a thing?

01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.701
- Want me to talk to her?
- No.

01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:41.948
I won't involve Eliza anymore.

01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:47.670
I'll try to find out
something about these guys.

01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:49.590
Find out what?

01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:53.590
We need to know how to handle them.

01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:56.467
Let's not complicate things further.

01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:00.140
I'll speak to them,
figure something out.

01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.181
As you wish.

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:07.789
Come to the police station
at <i>9</i> for the line-up.

01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:10.224
You think you'll catch him?

01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:13.266
We'll catch that dirty motherfucker.

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:28.387
Listen...

01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:29.502
Yes?

01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:33.189
I have this feeling
someone's following me.

01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:34.507
How so?

01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:37.502
Someone broke my windscreen.

01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:39.824
You parked in someone's spot.

01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:43.391
Someone broke my living room window too.

01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:45.908
Install a surveillance camera.

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:47.067
I did.

01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:51.903
Then confess to a priest.

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:53.626
Thanks.

01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:57.901
I'll be on my way.

01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:00.908
Isn't this a great view?

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:02.342
Yes.

01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:08.502
When we were in school,
the other side looked better.

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:14.184
The trees have grown,
you can't see much.

01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:15.982
True.

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.105
Well then, I'm off.

01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:21.507
Bye.

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.508
Hello.

01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.907
- Thanks for coming.
- It's fine.

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.784
How did it go this morning?

01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:46.425
I didn't take her.

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:47.906
Wasn't that the plan?

01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:51.623
We argued last night
and she said she'd take a cab.

01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:53.151
Did she sit the exam?

01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:55.066
No idea.

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:56.906
I see.

01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:59.701
Marius, this is why I called you out.

01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:03.109
They found a suspect in Eliza's case.

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:06.383
Could you come and see the line-up
this evening?

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:08.349
Why would I do that?

01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:11.591
She can't remember his face well.

01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:13.908
She needs help or he'll go free.

01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.511
But I didn't see him.

01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:18.180
Maybe you glimpsed him from behind

01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:20.587
and you could recognize him.

01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.305
How, if I never saw him?

01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:26.023
Marius,
do you agree he should pay?

01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:28.945
- Of course, but-
- Let me explain.

01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:31.909
Can you go there, by the gate?

01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:36.911
A bit further.

01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:41.068
- Can you see me?
- Yes.

01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:44.904
- How about now?
- Yes.

01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:46.591
Good. Come back here.

01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:53.906
Marius, isn't this you?

01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:57.621
- I don't think so.
- Look closer.

01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:01.146
No, it's not me.

01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:04.628
Don't you have trousers
and a sweater like that?

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:08.783
Jeans.
Everyone looks the same in jeans!

01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:12.263
Why did you tell me
you didn't call the police?

01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:14.064
- I didn't.
- You're lying.

01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:16.183
There's a call from your number.

01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.109
I called them, but not then.

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:20.064
- When then?
- When l found her.

01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:22.467
- At 8:03!
- I don't know precisely-

01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:26.631
You saw the attack and called,
you got scared and hung up!

01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:29.107
- It's not true!
- Look at this photo!

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:32.904
- You watched and did nothing!
- It's not me!

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:36.502
Why didn't you call for help?
How could you pass by?

01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:38.225
It's not me!

01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:41.310
I'm sorry too, but I am not guilty,
no one is.

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:44.743
- No one is?
- Somebody but I don't know who.

01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:47.307
So just let him get away!

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.229
Let bygones be bygones, right?

01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:53.070
Don't you dare see Eliza again,
understood?

01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:55.467
- That's not up to you.
- It isn't?

01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:57.628
Are you telling me what to do now?

01:34:57.820 --> 01:34:59.310
Beat it or I'll kill you!

01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:04.462
Lucky you're an old man.

01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:17.347
- Hello, Magda.
- What happened?

01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:20.584
I need to talk to Eliza
but she won't answer.

01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:22.630
Have you talked to her today?

01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:24.751
Have you, Magda?

01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.591
- Last night.
- Did she do the exam?

01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:29.067
I don't know.

01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:31.305
I told her to go.

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.260
What happened?

01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:37.826
At 9 she has to see
the rape suspects at the station.

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:40.544
- What's that?
- I fell.

01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.222
I really need to talk to her.

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:48.429
Wouldn't it be best to wail

01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:52.422
until she calms down,
and wants to talk to you?

01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:54.704
It really can't wait.

01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:57.821
As you wish.

01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:03.509
Can I ask you something?

01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:07.665
Can you give me your keys

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:10.227
and call ahead when you plan to come?

01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:15.221
Magda...

01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:19.988
How did we become such enemies?
Can you remember?

01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:27.062
Forgive me, I didn't mean it.

01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:28.341
Let me go!

01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:29.905
Forgive me, please.

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:31.505
Why are you doing this?

01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.907
I'm very sorry. Magda...

01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:38.421
I'm sorry.

01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:46.421
Go away.

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:54.750
Please, go away.

01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:40.460
- Good evening.
- Is something wrong?

01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:41.582
Yes.

01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:46.345
Let's talk after the exam.
And don't come to my home again.

01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:48.349
I know, but it's important.

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:51.908
A prosecutor visited me.
I thought you should know.

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:55.342
I didn't find the girl's paper.

01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:57.383
- You didn't find it?
- No.

01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:58.906
So...

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.381
I'm sorry.

01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:02.423
Don't come to my home again.

01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:04.067
I apologize.

01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:05.671
Be careful. Goodbye.

01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:06.907
Goodbye.

01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:26.590
- Good evening.
- Good evening, doctor.

01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:31.381
Doctor?

01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:32.980
Wait a moment!

01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:42.182
Your father did this for you.

01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:44.543
I have no reason to protect him.

01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:46.226
Think carefully.

01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:51.550
My father never asked me
to do anything inappropriate.

01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:53.141
So I don't understand...

01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:55.510
what you're getting at.

01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:00.381
Hello, Eliza.

01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:01.388
Hi.

01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:02.906
What's going on?

01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:04.340
Nothing. Just talking.

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:05.947
Sandu!

01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:08.989
- Yes, boss.
- Bring them in.

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:12.062
Are you OK?

01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:13.386
Come on in, please.

01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:29.071
Take your time.
Have a good look.

01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:31.903
Don't worry, they can't see you.

01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:33.906
Ready?

01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:38.066
Look ahead.

01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:40.545
Now turn to me.

01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:43.301
Now back.

01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:52.147
Now, read.

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:56.626
Get over here.

01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:59.983
Shut it or I'll kill you!
Get your... here, now?

01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:01.381
Step back.

01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:04.101
Next.

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:06.181
Get over here!

01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:09.031
Shut the fuck up or I'll kill you!

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:11.145
Get your cunt over here!

01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.421
Get it?

01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:13.906
Step back.

01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:16.661
- Want them to say something else?
- No.

01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:18.829
This is what he said, right?

01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:19.902
Yes.

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:21.701
Shall we go on?

01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:26.021
Next.

01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:28.751
Get over here!

01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.430
Shut up! I'll kill you!

01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:32.509
Get your cunt here!
Get it?

01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:33.906
Step back.

01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:36.941
Next.

01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:41.948
Come here!
Shut up! I'll kill you!

01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:43.744
Get your cunt here!
Get it?

01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:45.021
Once again.

01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:52.101
Again.

01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:58.342
Again.

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:03.508
Again.

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:14.831
Enough! Enough!

01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:17.143
I'm sorry, Eliza.
I'm sorry.

01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:27.348
If you recognize him, tell us.

01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:34.065
It's none of them.

01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:37.781
Take your time.

01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:42.029
The guy we arrested today
is among them.

01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:46.631
That's not him.

01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:49.421
Are you sure?

01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:52.670
I think so.

01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:57.907
Eliza!

01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:06.950
Eliza, wait!

01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:12.508
Now you're running away from me?

01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:13.781
Let go of me!

01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:16.984
Please, calm down,
I want to talk to you!

01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:18.545
About what?

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:20.026
Please, Eliza!

01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:22.302
Please?
How could you do that?

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:24.821
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:29.469
Sorry? How could you even think
he wouldn't have defended me?

01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:31.469
There're things you don't know.

01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:33.230
I don't need to!

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:35.821
You can't set out
in life with anyone!

01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:37.903
It's no longer your business!

01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:39.830
And he's not just anyone!

01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:42.829
Fine, Eliza, fine.

01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:45.987
Do what you think is best.

01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:50.989
Can I go now?

01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:52.582
Yes.

01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:56.586
But what did you do
at your exam today?

01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:00.541
I don't even want to talk about it.

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:04.661
I see.

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:11.061
You don't have to worry.
I did what I thought was best.

01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:12.711
So it's fine.

01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:14.542
Really?

01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:17.466
Good, Eliza.

01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:19.461
Well done.

01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:23.225
I'm glad you used your own head
to decide.

01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:25.740
I'm glad.

01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:34.701
Are you OK?
Know where you're sleeping?

01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:36.387
I'm OK.

01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:40.630
- Can I give you a ride?
- No, don't worry.

01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:42.711
Just be careful.

01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:52.749
Tomorrow's Open Day at school.

01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:55.261
We're saying goodbye.
You can come...

01:44:57.380 --> 01:44:58.791
Thank you.

01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:03.070
Daddy loves you.

01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:10.380
Take care.

01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:11.986
Open up!

01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:44.746
Thank you.

01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:48.949
- Want some meatballs?
- No, thanks, this is plenty.

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:10.902
<i>Hound Natal a speech therapist.</i>

01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:12.625
I'll call again tomorrow.

01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:14.147
Thank you.

01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:17.511
You were right.

01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:21.466
I'll enrol him in my school.
It's easier for everyone.

01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:23.941
As you wish.

01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:32.231
- Can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:35.940
Can you look after Matei
in the morning?

01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:39.429
I'm seeing a doctor,
I don't want him with me.

01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:42.541
Of course.

01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:47.741
There's a park nearby.
He won't be any trouble.

01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:50.781
All right.

01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:01.549
May I take him to school?

01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:06.144
I'm going to Eliza's graduation.

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.501
Take him along.

01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:10.751
Did you two make up?

01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:12.821
I don't know.

01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:15.301
It's difficult.

01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:17.824
Children are like that.

01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:20.341
Yes, you can never know.

01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:24.502
I'll get the couch ready.

01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:26.544
I'm dead tired.

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:30.264
- Thanks.
- It's OK.

01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:00.989
You have to wait.

01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:03.308
Only one child at a time!

01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:06.900
Please tell your son he has to wait.

01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:08.590
It's fine, madam.

01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:10.270
The instructor said so.

01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:12.463
It's not his responsibility.

01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:14.065
Those are the rules.

01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:18.345
If we apply those rules to kids
they'll never get their turn.

01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:20.190
Maybe when they're older...

01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:23.509
- Tell your son to wait!
- They're kids, lady!

01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:25.702
- Matei!
- Don't throw stones!

01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:28.345
Come over here.

01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:31.747
- Really...
- I'm very sorry.

01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:34.062
- No throwing.
- I apologize.

01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:35.261
Did he hit you?

01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:38.265
Why did you do that?

01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:39.666
He should have waited.

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.585
That's true,

01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:43.470
but you can't act like that.

01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:44.741
Why?

01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:47.748
That's no way to behave.

01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:49.670
So how should I behave?

01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:54.464
It's complicated.
Your mother will explain.

01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:59.304
When you're with me,
never do that, all right?

01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:02.702
Good.

01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:09.709
Let's go, it's getting late.

01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:20.344
Wait here for a moment.

01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:23.825
Good morning, doctor.

01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:25.900
Good morning.

01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:31.666
Hello, Csilla.

01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:33.466
Who's the woman?

01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:35.105
Mr. Bulai's wife.

01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:37.541
He had a heart attack this morning.

01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:40.987
She's waiting to talk to you.

01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:44.825
And the prosecutors are waiting
in my office.

01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:48.188
I see.

01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:53.541
Wish me luck.

01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:55.151
Sok szerencsÃ©t.

01:53:55.420 --> 01:53:56.751
That means luck?

01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:58.021
It does.

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:04.222
I'm so sorry, madam.

01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:08.268
Last night, my husband asked me

01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:10.349
to give you this.

01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:11.991
Madam...

01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:14.907
Please.
It was his wish.

01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:21.230
Thank you. Sorry for your loss.

01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:24.307
Do you have your husband's ID?

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:25.308
Yes.

01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:26.706
Come along, please.

01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:29.747
Thank you.

01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:43.906
Good morning.

01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:47.064
Did you bring handcuffs?

01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:50.184
Come on, doctor,
we're human too!

01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:53.307
I got this now from Mr. Bulai.

01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:55.589
Will you need it?

01:54:56.740 --> 01:54:59.107
We're just doing our job, don't you see?

01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:01.746
Yes. And it has to be done.

01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:04.383
But you know what we say here:

01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:06.708
No use excising the tumour if...

01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:08.905
We do what we can.

01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:11.228
Will you be here next week?

01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:12.421
Where else?

01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:16.387
Till Monday, then.
The investigation must continue.

01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:17.661
I understand.

01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:20.746
You'll always find me here.

01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:24.626
But let's keep the kids out of it.

01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:29.027
Sure. We'll see...

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:31.460
Have a good day.

01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:43.662
Let's go.

01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:12.266
Are you OK?

01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:19.666
<i>Mafia.</i>

01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:00.906
Hello, Eliza.

01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:03.062
Hello.

01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:04.827
How are you?

01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:06.907
Fine.

01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:09.510
A bit nervous...

01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:12.665
<i>Hows Mum'?</i>

01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:14.501
She's fine.

01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:17.029
She won't bar the windows after all.

01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:18.267
That's better.

01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:19.782
Yes.

01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:22.303
You get the results on Thursday?

01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:23.542
Yes.

01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:27.467
But I'm not sure I'll leave.

01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:31.385
It would be a pity
but it's your decision.

01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:37.147
Dad, about the exam...

01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:38.461
Yes?

01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:45.184
They let me write a bit longer
after the <i>3</i> hours were up.

01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:47.981
<i>L</i> mean...

01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:51.107
I started crying and they let me.

01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:55.461
So I didn't need to do anything else.

01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:57.980
I see.

01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:04.589
Didn't I do well?

01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:12.668
Can you take a photo? A keepsake?

01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:13.782
Sure.

01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:26.630
Look at me.

01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:29.501
Smile!

01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:33.831
Again...

01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:36.991
Another smile...

01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:38.780
Happier!
