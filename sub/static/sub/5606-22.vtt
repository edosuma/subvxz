WEBVTT

00:03.270 --> 00:06.438
GIRL:<i> You're still going to</i>
<i> Justin's thing tonight, right?</i>

00:06.440 --> 00:08.474
Yeah.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.642
I'll probably get there
around 11:00.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.379
Depends on how much wine
Mr. and Mrs. Hiller drink

00:13.381 --> 00:15.314
at dinner tonight.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.383
Can't believe you get paid
15 bucks an hour

00:17.385 --> 00:20.152
to sit on your ass all night.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.720
Well, occasionally
the baby cries,

00:21.722 --> 00:24.390
and I have to go check on her.

00:24.392 --> 00:28.027
But, yeah, I, uh, pretty much
just watch Netflix.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.461
Whatever.
(chuckles)

00:29.463 --> 00:30.763
So let me ask you something,

00:30.765 --> 00:33.365
does this outfit look
too trashy for tonight?

00:35.436 --> 00:38.537
Well, on, like,
a scale of from

00:38.539 --> 00:40.239
Taylor to Miley,

00:40.241 --> 00:41.707
you're, um...

00:41.709 --> 00:43.542
you're at a Kardashian level
of trashiness right now.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.710
Which one?

00:44.712 --> 00:46.178
Does it matter?

00:46.180 --> 00:48.047
Ugh. I'm gonna change.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.515
(chuckles softly)

00:49.517 --> 00:51.350
Text me when you're done.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.584
Okay.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.086
Lates.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.572
(air conditioner clicks on)

01:29.757 --> 01:31.523
(baby crying over monitor)

01:45.372 --> 01:48.807
(baby continues crying)

02:00.488 --> 02:01.820
(sighs)

02:01.822 --> 02:02.888
(clears throat)

02:23.444 --> 02:26.578
(dialing)

02:36.423 --> 02:38.857
(muffled phone ringing)

02:49.770 --> 02:52.437
(ringing continues)

03:15.829 --> 03:19.398
<i> (Hawaii Five-O</i>
theme song plays)

03:46.860 --> 03:48.660
MAN: Thanks
(woman giggling)

03:48.662 --> 03:50.529
Thank you.
Keep the change.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.697
(giggles)

03:51.699 --> 03:52.698
Oh, that was fun.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.699
Oh, yeah.

03:53.701 --> 03:54.967
Night's not over.

03:54.969 --> 03:57.703
Ooh, save it
for the bedroom, cowboy.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.538
Or...

03:59.540 --> 04:00.872
Or what?

04:00.874 --> 04:03.342
Well, we still have
the sitter for a half hour.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.577
Thought we'd give the hammock
in the backyard a try.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.613
(laughing):
Oh, please.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.781
I am not taking you
to the emergency room

04:09.783 --> 04:11.650
for a sex-related injury.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.685
(scoffs)
All right.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.753
Open the door.

04:23.831 --> 04:24.896
Addison?

04:26.333 --> 04:27.633
MAN: Mr. and Mrs.
Hiller. (gasps)

04:27.635 --> 04:30.669
Don't be alarmed,
I'm with STS Security.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.004
(baby coos)

04:32.006 --> 04:33.338
I was dispatched to check on
an alarm incident.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.307
Why are you holding my baby?

04:35.309 --> 04:36.308
She was crying.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.177
No one else was home.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.045
I don't understand,
if the alarm went off,

04:40.047 --> 04:41.513
why didn't anybody call us?

04:41.515 --> 04:43.982
(groans)
Oh, my God!

04:45.319 --> 04:46.785
Please don't do this.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.453
Please.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.302
KAMEKONA:
<i> For thousands of years,</i>

05:03.304 --> 05:05.003
man has taken to the sea,

05:05.005 --> 05:07.773
building vessels to conquer
the mighty ocean.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.508
Now, after nearly a year

05:09.510 --> 05:11.743
of planning,

05:11.745 --> 05:13.312
months of robust pre-sale,

05:13.314 --> 05:16.014
finally time
for my inaugural voyage

05:16.016 --> 05:17.382
of my latest and greatest

05:17.384 --> 05:19.351
enterprise:

05:19.353 --> 05:22.854
Kamekona inter-island
booze cruise.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.457
Congratulations, big guy.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.725
We knew you could do it.

05:26.727 --> 05:27.959
Well, not to be a killjoy,

05:27.961 --> 05:29.494
but as ship medic,

05:29.496 --> 05:31.463
I do have to advise that

05:31.464 --> 05:33.431
consuming alcohol
could severely impair

05:33.434 --> 05:36.635
our ability to operate
this vessel safely.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.404
Well, as the first
mate-slash-DJ-slash bartender,

05:39.406 --> 05:41.807
I got one thing to say to that:

05:41.809 --> 05:42.874
Overruled.
Boom.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.380
I'd like to throw out
a special thank you

05:48.382 --> 05:51.350
to my bruddah
from another mudda,

05:51.352 --> 05:53.819
Steve McGarrett,

05:53.821 --> 05:55.387
for generously
offering his services

05:55.389 --> 05:58.724
as nautical consultant
for this test run.

05:58.726 --> 05:59.925
Pro bono, I might add.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.361
Yeah, we, uh,
we firmly established

06:02.363 --> 06:05.030
that I won't be getting paid, so
why don't we christen this lady,

06:05.032 --> 06:06.465
and get her out on the water?

06:06.467 --> 06:07.866
I'll drink to that.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.735
Although I do have to admit
I am perplexed

06:09.737 --> 06:11.670
by the name that Kamekona
has chosen for her.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.941
I didn't pick it, Doc.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.977
This boat is from a HPD
property forfeiture auction.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.879
Re-painting wasn't
in the budget.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.081
Not after he blew it all
on this.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.151
Oh!

06:26.153 --> 06:27.652
STEVE:
Wow.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.955
Yeah, that's impressive.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.089
Cuz is a straight-up wizard

06:31.091 --> 06:33.292
when it comes to branding.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.494
All right, all right,
let's make this official.

06:35.496 --> 06:38.830
McGarrett, want to
do the honors?

06:41.568 --> 06:42.868
Really?

06:42.869 --> 06:44.169
What, you couldn't spring
for a bigger bottle?

06:44.171 --> 06:46.071
It's a ceremonial gesture.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.506
Ceremonial, okay.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.144
(clears throat)

06:54.047 --> 06:55.714
To the sea,

06:55.716 --> 06:57.582
to the sailors of old,

06:57.584 --> 07:00.085
and to the SS<i> Thong Magnet.</i>

07:04.725 --> 07:06.458
(phone ringing)
MAX: Mazel tov.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.560
McGarrett.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.562
Oh, no.

07:10.564 --> 07:13.698
(sirens wailing)

07:13.700 --> 07:14.766
(tires screech)

07:18.505 --> 07:20.572
Chin, what do you got?

07:20.574 --> 07:21.673
Joel and Susan Hiller.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.442
Housekeeper arrived this morning

07:23.444 --> 07:25.610
and found them
tied up on the floor.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.579
Their infant daughter, however,
was left untouched in her crib.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.331
I thought this was a kidnapping.

07:29.332 --> 07:31.082
If the parents are accounted for
and so is the kid,

07:31.084 --> 07:32.801
who's the victim?

07:32.802 --> 07:34.519
KONO: Addison Wells.
22 years old,

07:34.521 --> 07:36.455
originally from Minnesota.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.007
She's currently a senior
at Oahu State.

07:38.008 --> 07:39.558
She started babysitting
for the Hillers six months ago.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.626
CHIN: Parents are getting
on a flight to Hawaii.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.895
Minneapolis PD is up
on the phones,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.664
but so far no ransom call.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.499
Well, I think if
they wanted a ransom,

07:47.501 --> 07:48.784
they would've taken the kid.

07:48.785 --> 07:50.068
I agree, the Hillers
have deep pockets.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.604
But the kidnapper was interested
in Addison, not a payday.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.105
Okay, putting motive aside
for a minute,

07:54.107 --> 07:55.740
why did he abduct her from here?

07:55.742 --> 07:57.292
That's a good point.

07:57.293 --> 07:58.843
Seems risky.
Well, Addison lived on campus

07:58.846 --> 08:01.012
and the access to the dorms
is tightly controlled.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.081
So grabbing her here may have
been his best opportunity.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.000
Right, it also means

08:05.001 --> 08:06.918
he was stalking her long enough
to know her schedule, right?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.887
KONO:
Yeah.

08:08.888 --> 08:10.855
CSU ran diagnostics
on the Hiller security system.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.859
The alarm was disabled
from a remote location

08:13.861 --> 08:15.527
just prior to the abduction.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.562
Kidnapper must have hacked it.
That takes considerable skill.

08:17.564 --> 08:18.797
Well, skills he's got.

08:18.799 --> 08:19.965
He hacked the entire house.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.933
Everything connected
with the home's network,

08:21.935 --> 08:23.952
from the thermostat,

08:23.953 --> 08:25.970
to the baby monitor,
the security cameras,

08:25.973 --> 08:27.806
even that laptop
that belongs to the vic.

08:31.278 --> 08:34.212
All right, get this
computer to Jerry.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.883
Let's sit the Hillers down
with an HPD sketch artist.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.951
If our perp went to this much
trouble to abduct Addison,

08:39.953 --> 08:42.120
I hate to think what
he's gonna do to her.

08:44.057 --> 08:44.990
KONO:
<i> Were you two close?</i>

08:44.992 --> 08:46.525
Yeah, I'd say so.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.926
Was she seeing anybody maybe?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.060
Does she have a boyfriend?

08:49.062 --> 08:51.663
No, there was this guy
she met online,

08:51.665 --> 08:52.964
but that didn't pan out.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.866
Why? What happened?
I don't know.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.568
They never actually met
face to face.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.236
They e-mailed back and forth
for, like, a month,

08:58.238 --> 08:59.738
and then it just suddenly ended.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.806
How come? Did she say?

09:01.808 --> 09:03.325
No, I asked.

09:03.326 --> 09:04.843
She clearly didn't want
to talk about it.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.711
But I think the guy
really creeped her out.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.647
KONO:
Hmm.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.582
Do you recall if she ever
mentioned this guy's name?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.119
Jeremy.

09:14.121 --> 09:17.089
JERRY:
Meet Jeremy F.

09:17.090 --> 09:20.058
His online dating profile showed
up on Addison's browser history.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.727
I also found a trove of deleted
e-mails between the two of them

09:22.729 --> 09:24.296
going back over a month.

09:24.298 --> 09:25.998
Just scanning through them,

09:25.999 --> 09:27.699
I'd say their correspondence
could best be described as,

09:27.701 --> 09:29.901
well, "intimate."

09:29.903 --> 09:31.620
Yeah, one problem.

09:31.621 --> 09:33.338
This photo doesn't look anything
like the composite sketch

09:33.340 --> 09:34.673
we got on our perp.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.107
There's a pretty good
reason for that.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.776
Knowing that many people often
misrepresent themselves

09:37.778 --> 09:38.777
on the Internet,

09:38.779 --> 09:40.612
I did a reverse image search,

09:40.614 --> 09:42.747
and the photos were stolen
from this guy.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.849
He is a collegiate rugby player

09:44.851 --> 09:46.318
from Melbourne, Australia.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.986
His favorite movie is
<i> The Shawshank Redemption,</i>

09:47.988 --> 09:49.955
and his social media profile

09:49.957 --> 09:52.023
is set to public, which means
that anyone in the world

09:52.025 --> 09:54.059
can download these images.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.061
Okay, so Jeremy F
took this guy's photos

09:56.063 --> 09:57.362
to catfish our victim.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.830
JERRY:
Exactly.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.031
And once Addison realized this,

10:00.033 --> 10:01.733
she sent him
a strongly worded e-mail,

10:01.735 --> 10:02.867
threatened to call the cops

10:02.869 --> 10:04.336
if he ever tried
to contact her again,

10:04.338 --> 10:06.104
and that's where
the correspondence ended.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.772
And I'll just bet this creeper

10:07.774 --> 10:09.774
couldn't take no for an answer.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.560
So he started stalking

10:11.561 --> 10:13.345
this poor woman until he could
find the perfect opportunity

10:13.347 --> 10:15.164
to grab her.

10:15.165 --> 10:16.982
Okay, Jerry, we're gonna need
to trace these e-mails.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.317
I hear you, but our kidnapper
is no amateur.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.152
He was smart enough
to send the e-mails

10:21.154 --> 10:23.188
through a secure
socket tunneling protocol.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.724
CSU's working to
break the encryption,

10:25.726 --> 10:26.858
but it's gonna take time.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.293
Jerry, that's time
we don't have.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.362
Come on, I mean,
this girl's life is at stake.

10:30.364 --> 10:32.364
Well, unless you know
of some computer genius

10:32.366 --> 10:34.799
who can do the work of an entire
crime lab in half the time,

10:34.801 --> 10:36.334
we're out of luck.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.736
Actually,

10:37.738 --> 10:40.005
I know just the guy.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.241
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:<i> Here's</i>
<i> your sunrise cocktail, sir.</i>

10:43.243 --> 10:44.309
Thank you.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.082
Ah.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.918
Oh, please, God,

10:53.920 --> 10:56.287
if you exist, prove it to me
right here and now.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.193
(quietly):
Thank you.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.970
(coughs)

11:11.972 --> 11:13.271
(clears throat)

11:15.075 --> 11:16.374
Hi, excuse me, um,

11:16.376 --> 11:18.877
is that you on the cover
of that magazine?

11:20.213 --> 11:22.814
Oh, boy, that's so embarrassing.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.749
My publicist insisted
that I do it.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.251
My name's Adam.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.153
My friends call me Toast.
Mia.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.255
I should probably know
who you are.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.990
Not unless you're a gamer.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.426
Yeah, I created one
of the fastest grossing

11:34.428 --> 11:36.428
mobile games of all time.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.963
We hit ten million downloads
in the first month.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.865
Oh, wow, that's incredible.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.167
That's what Tim Cook said.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.168
But enough about me,

11:43.170 --> 11:44.402
what is it that you do?

11:44.404 --> 11:45.904
Um, I'm a model.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.772
I was just in Lanai doing
a swimwear shoot.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.341
Ah. Swimwear, very cool.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.310
(chuckles)

11:52.312 --> 11:55.780
So, what brings you
to Los Angeles today, Toast?

11:55.782 --> 11:56.781
Waffles.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.817
What? (chuckles)

11:58.819 --> 12:01.186
Well, not just waffles,
fried chicken too.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.487
Have you ever been
to Roscoe's

12:02.489 --> 12:04.289
in Hollywood?

12:04.291 --> 12:06.357
Uh, yeah, sure.
It's great.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.827
I don't know if I'd travel
3,000 miles for it.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.512
Yeah, well,

12:10.513 --> 12:12.196
clearly you're not as dedicated
to excellent waffles as I am.

12:12.199 --> 12:16.201
But if you're free later, I'd
love to take you to breakfast.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.269
You do know we land
at 5:00, right?

12:18.271 --> 12:20.138
I don't do time zones.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.439
I do, however,

12:21.441 --> 12:24.242
very much enjoy
a good breakfast,

12:24.244 --> 12:25.877
hence the name.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.879
You're funny.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.247
And you're
mind-blowingly attractive.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.021
(coughs, clears throat)

12:39.226 --> 12:42.193
(clears throat)

12:42.195 --> 12:43.928
You're gonna just pretend

12:43.930 --> 12:45.930
like you didn't see us or what?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.098
Hey.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.168
Jersey. McGruff.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.169
What a coincidence.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.804
You guys going to LA?

12:52.806 --> 12:54.405
No.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.007
No, and neither are you.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.412
Impeccable timing
as always, fellas.

13:01.414 --> 13:05.049
Thanks to you, I am not
having chicken and waffles

13:05.051 --> 13:06.551
with a bona fide ten.

13:06.553 --> 13:07.385
DANNY:
Hold on, hold on.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.254
Stop. You?

13:09.256 --> 13:11.256
You created Poopie Penguin?

13:11.258 --> 13:12.357
Yeah.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.792
Unbelievable.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.226
What's Poopie Penguin?
That's right.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.828
What's Poopie Penguin?

13:16.829 --> 13:18.429
What's Poopie-- what are you--
you live under a rock?

13:18.431 --> 13:20.398
Poopie Penguin is a game that
you play on your cell phone

13:20.400 --> 13:22.534
where you're a penguin, and
you're flying around in the air,

13:22.536 --> 13:24.135
and you poop on people's
heads for points.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.137
Penguins don't fly.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.138
No.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.273
They do in my universe.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.108
Let me explain something to you,

13:30.110 --> 13:33.244
my kids, Charlie and Grace,
they play this game non-stop.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.113
Must have spent $100
on it just last month.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.215
Yeah, that's the beauty
of in-app purchases.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.284
Yeah, I don't think there is
anything beautiful about it.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.252
I think that it is a scam.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.887
You're ripping off children
is what you're doing.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.556
I mean, you give them
the app for free,

13:44.558 --> 13:46.224
and then they got to pay
if they want to keep playing

13:46.226 --> 13:48.126
for the power-ups and the boosts
or whatever you call it.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.562
You're like a drug dealer
pushing dope.

13:50.564 --> 13:52.363
First taste is free,
then they're hooked for life.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.232
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.534
I hate the game, I do very much.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.169
Would you please stop
and let him focus?

13:58.171 --> 14:00.438
He needs to focus.
This is important.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.140
(sighs)

14:02.142 --> 14:03.441
I'm just curious,

14:03.443 --> 14:05.476
how do you think
of something like that anyway?

14:05.478 --> 14:08.146
Ah, simple.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.114
A, poop is funny.
I'll give you that.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.250
B, it's relatable,
everybody poops.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.251
And C,

14:13.253 --> 14:14.703
it's easy to monetize.

14:14.704 --> 14:16.154
I mean, biology tells us that
in order to poop,

14:16.156 --> 14:18.323
you have to eat,
and I control the food supply.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.458
All right with
the biology, okay?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.460
You sell 99 cent

14:22.462 --> 14:24.896
virtual penguin food,
all right?

14:24.898 --> 14:26.197
Get over yourself.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.466
(computer beeps)
Winner, winner,

14:28.468 --> 14:30.235
chicken-waffle dinner.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.236
You got a location?

14:31.238 --> 14:32.470
I do.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.239
It looks like
those catfish e-mails were sent

14:34.241 --> 14:36.207
from an office building
downtown.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.976
(elevator bell dings)

14:43.316 --> 14:44.415
Toast, talk to me.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.885
Keep going about ten more yards,

14:46.887 --> 14:48.887
and then head right.
Signal's tracing

14:48.889 --> 14:51.422
to a terminal
in the far corner.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.235
Can I help you?

15:04.237 --> 15:08.339
You got a beautiful family,
Mr. Mintz.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.608
I imagine they're not
gonna be too pleased

15:10.610 --> 15:12.176
when they find out
that their old man

15:12.178 --> 15:13.278
is an online predator.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.047
Please,
you have to understand,

15:16.049 --> 15:17.482
I'm not a bad person.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.250
Okay.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.419
Look, Addison Wells found out
who you really were,

15:21.421 --> 15:23.488
and then all of a sudden
she-she ends up missing.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.056
H-How do you explain that?

15:25.058 --> 15:29.227
Now, look, I admit
that I misrepresented myself

15:29.229 --> 15:31.296
to Addison,

15:31.297 --> 15:33.364
but I had nothing to do
with her disappearance.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.634
It was all just a fantasy.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.436
I never planned on acting on it.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.073
Chin showed Mintz's photo
to the Hillers.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.341
They don't seem to think
he's our guy.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.575
I'm not surprised, look at this.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.544
Mintz was perving on at least

15:46.545 --> 15:48.512
a dozen other women, and he
was actually at this terminal

15:48.515 --> 15:51.282
chatting one of them
up last night.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.650
He logged off around 11:00 p.m.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.252
Okay. There's no way

15:54.254 --> 15:57.989
he could've been in Kahala
at the time of the abduction.

15:57.991 --> 16:01.359
ADDISON:
Please. Please.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.261
Please.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.197
Please let me go.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.733
I don't want to die here.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.535
Please.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.437
Please let me go.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.338
(Vivaldi's<i> Requiem, Dies irae</i>
plays over headphones)

16:23.149 --> 16:24.749
<i> JERRY: Toast just did a sweep</i>
<i> of Addison's laptop.</i>

16:24.751 --> 16:26.417
Found something
the crime lab missed.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.418
Spyware.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.520
And she had it bad.

16:29.521 --> 16:31.621
I'm not talking about the kind
that slows your computer down,

16:31.624 --> 16:33.358
and gives you pop-up
ads for boner pills.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.492
I'm talking about Cherry Bomb.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.228
What's "Cherry Bomb?"

16:37.230 --> 16:39.230
It's like Microsoft Office
for black hat hackers.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.332
It's a suite of malware
that includes key loggers,

16:41.334 --> 16:43.167
root kits, and
fingerprint evasions

16:43.169 --> 16:45.336
Real scary stuff.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.305
The thing is,
we found the executable file

16:47.307 --> 16:48.506
that infected Addison's system.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.175
It was installed
over five months ago.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.610
So the spyware landed
on her computer before

16:52.612 --> 16:54.412
she was catfished by Mintz,

16:54.413 --> 16:56.213
which means that it had to be
her kidnapper who infected her.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.616
We find out who's behind
the hack, we found our guy.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.721
Okay, guys,

17:03.723 --> 17:07.692
I don't know who attacked
Addison's computer,

17:07.694 --> 17:10.228
but I might know
someone who does.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.130
(hip-hop music playing loudly
through car speakers)

17:23.576 --> 17:25.176
Dude, what are you doing?

17:25.178 --> 17:26.544
Just keeping it real.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.780
I don't want the old crew
thinking I sold out.

17:28.782 --> 17:31.082
Why do you think we parked
two blocks away?

17:36.556 --> 17:38.823
DANNY:
<i> I can't believe this.</i>

17:38.825 --> 17:42.260
We're sending Scooby and Shaggy
in to work this lead.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.200
(intercom beeps)

17:49.202 --> 17:50.201
MAN:
Password.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.103
Joshua.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.788
Nice.

17:53.789 --> 17:55.472
Joshua was the backdoor password
that Matthew Broderick used

17:55.475 --> 17:57.408
to access the Cheyenne Mountain
Nuclear Complex

17:57.410 --> 17:59.444
in the 1983 sci-fi classic
<i> War Games.</i>

17:59.446 --> 18:01.312
That's right.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.381
Your nerd credentials
are in order, you may enter.

18:05.151 --> 18:07.418
(dubstep music
blares over speakers)

18:18.331 --> 18:22.733
So, which one of these
lovable rogues is our Han Solo?

18:22.735 --> 18:24.302
10 o'clock.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.237
In the bean bag chair.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.638
He goes by Null Legend.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.739
He authored Cherry Bomb.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.344
(laughs)
Well, look at this.

18:33.346 --> 18:37.148
Captain Bird Turd is slumming it
with the code jockeys again.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.217
What, did you blow through
your millions already?

18:39.219 --> 18:40.902
Nope.

18:40.903 --> 18:42.586
I was hoping you could
help my boy here.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.256
See, someone's been using Cherry
Bomb to creep on his sister.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.824
Sorry to hear,

18:46.826 --> 18:48.693
but I just give people
the tools to hack,

18:48.695 --> 18:50.895
it's up to them
to do so responsibly.

18:50.897 --> 18:55.399
Besides, my customers pay
top dollar to stay anon.

18:55.401 --> 18:56.901
Except they're not
so anonymous to you.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.237
We both know that you
keep records of all your buyers,

18:59.239 --> 19:00.905
so that way,
if the heat does come down,

19:00.907 --> 19:04.809
you've got someone to roll on.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.211
Let me be clear, okay?

19:07.213 --> 19:11.382
It's not that I can't help you,
it's that I don't want to.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.518
And I think you know why.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.619
This is going great.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.154
About as well as I expected.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.788
Okay, all right.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.423
Okay, it's obvious you two
have some history,

19:19.425 --> 19:22.293
but can we just take a step back
and focus on my problem?

19:22.295 --> 19:24.345
Hold that thought, Jerry.

19:24.346 --> 19:26.396
Patrick here was about to
tell us how I stole his idea.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.398
First of all,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.400
very uncool using my real name,

19:29.402 --> 19:30.835
and second,
you<i> did</i> steal my idea.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.637
Here we go.
Okay, remember?

19:32.639 --> 19:34.305
We were blasting a J
in the Zippie's parking lot

19:34.307 --> 19:36.707
and a bird dropped a deuce
right on my shoulder,

19:36.709 --> 19:38.776
and then we started talking
about how that would make

19:38.778 --> 19:40.645
a cool video game.

19:40.646 --> 19:42.513
Yeah, but in your version the
player was just an average dude

19:42.515 --> 19:43.915
who was trying to avoid
getting pooped on.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.816
It was my idea to make
the player the pooper,

19:45.818 --> 19:47.685
not the poopee.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.553
Plus, when I brought it up to
you a couple days later,

19:49.556 --> 19:50.821
you said, quote,

19:50.823 --> 19:52.690
"That's the dumbest idea ever,"
enquote.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.691
In my defense,

19:53.693 --> 19:55.593
I was sober when I said that.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.328
Okay, look, Null Legend,
or Patrick,

19:57.330 --> 19:58.329
whatever your name is...

19:58.331 --> 19:59.730
It's Patrick.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.399
Patrick.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.801
...the customer
you're protecting,

20:02.802 --> 20:04.202
the guy in this picture,
he kidnapped a girl.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.270
Dude, your sister was kidnapped?

20:06.272 --> 20:07.838
No that was just a clever ruse.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.407
I'm actually with Five-O.

20:09.408 --> 20:10.975
And all I got to do is
say the word,

20:10.977 --> 20:13.127
and the cavalry
will storm this place,

20:13.128 --> 20:15.278
seize every computer in here,
and arrest your entire crew.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.681
How many customers are gonna
want to do business

20:16.683 --> 20:19.317
with you then?

20:19.319 --> 20:21.319
I can't believe you
narc'd me out.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.720
I can't believe
you're still running Linux

20:22.722 --> 20:24.989
on a 32-bit Samurai stack.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.292
Get out of the dark ages, dude.

20:28.294 --> 20:29.694
Also, get us that name.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.263
(softly):
Yeah.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.298
(Steve grunts)

21:15.708 --> 21:17.642
Let's get HPD and CSU down here,

21:17.644 --> 21:19.910
tear this place apart.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.350
(siren chirps,
indistinct radio chatter)

21:28.988 --> 21:31.355
(siren wailing in the distance)

21:49.309 --> 21:51.075
DANNY:
Yo.

21:51.077 --> 21:54.312
Okay, so this place is leased
to a guy named Jacob Holm.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.380
Neighbors have not seen him
for at least a couple days.

21:56.382 --> 21:58.683
Well, it probably means
Addison was never here, right?

21:58.685 --> 22:01.686
Okay, so this is what
we know about Jacob Holm.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.754
He worked in I.T.
at a local law firm.

22:03.756 --> 22:07.425
That was, until he was fired for
downloading confidential files

22:07.427 --> 22:08.760
off the company's server.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.094
Yeah, Holm's bosses
agreed to drop the charges

22:10.096 --> 22:12.029
if he just returned
the stolen data,

22:12.031 --> 22:13.798
but instead
he turned around and leaked

22:13.800 --> 22:15.717
hundreds of e-mails to the press

22:15.718 --> 22:17.635
proving that the law firm was
wrapped up in all kinds of dirt.

22:17.637 --> 22:21.472
They were destroying evidence,
covering up fraud,

22:21.474 --> 22:23.541
even threatened witnesses.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.609
When the story broke, the press
branded Holm a "hacktivist."

22:25.611 --> 22:28.479
He ended up serving 18 months
of a five year sentence,

22:28.481 --> 22:30.414
and, uh, he was released
last July.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.016
Where'd you find all this stuff?

22:32.018 --> 22:33.484
Folder in his nightstand.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.486
Ah, so he's proud of it.
He thinks he's a hero?

22:35.488 --> 22:36.987
It doesn't make any sense.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.756
I mean, Holm's one prior arrest

22:38.757 --> 22:40.524
was for a crime that was
ideologically motivated.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.526
All right, how does a guy
go from hacking a law firm

22:42.528 --> 22:43.728
to kidnapping a college kid?

22:56.776 --> 22:58.843
Ahoy, Captain!

22:58.845 --> 23:00.544
Ahoy.

23:00.546 --> 23:04.648
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be a backseat sailor,

23:04.650 --> 23:06.050
but just want to make sure
everything's all right

23:06.052 --> 23:08.018
with the ship.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.654
All good, bruddah.
Why you asking?

23:10.656 --> 23:13.391
Well, it's just that,
according to my calculations,

23:13.393 --> 23:15.393
it appears that we've travelled
approximately ten feet

23:15.395 --> 23:17.495
in the last 40 minutes.

23:17.497 --> 23:20.631
What?
How is that possible?

23:20.633 --> 23:22.666
It appears that our vessel
is currently becalmed.

23:22.668 --> 23:26.504
I would put the wind speed
at a one on the Beaufort scale.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.671
English.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.473
There is no wind,

23:29.475 --> 23:31.142
hence the boat isn't moving.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.749
KAMEKONA:
Flippa!

23:39.685 --> 23:41.118
Flippa!

23:41.120 --> 23:42.853
(retching)

23:42.855 --> 23:44.155
What gives, brah?

23:44.157 --> 23:46.490
You're supposed to be my GPS.

23:46.492 --> 23:48.626
Sorry, cuz, I got seasick.

23:51.464 --> 23:54.532
I see why our navigation
system's on the fritz.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.833
Well, leaving your first mate
in charge of the liquor

23:55.835 --> 23:58.169
may not have been
the most prudent move.

23:58.171 --> 23:59.170
Don't sweat it, Doc.

23:59.172 --> 24:01.505
I got an auxiliary engine

24:01.507 --> 24:03.507
just for this situation.

24:03.509 --> 24:06.477
(engine whining)

24:08.114 --> 24:10.981
I assume you checked
that the battery was charged

24:10.983 --> 24:12.583
before we set sail.

24:12.585 --> 24:13.584
This thing has a battery?

24:18.224 --> 24:19.457
Mayday. Mayday.

24:19.459 --> 24:22.126
This is the SS<i> Thong Magnet</i>

24:22.128 --> 24:23.694
needing emergency assistance.

24:26.032 --> 24:29.200
And I'm afraid the radio is
powered by the battery as well.

24:29.202 --> 24:33.037
And we lost cell service
a few hours ago.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.772
Why are you so calm about this?

24:34.774 --> 24:36.240
Well, I project
outward confidence

24:36.242 --> 24:38.075
as a way of coping with stress.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.577
Inside, I'm terrified.

24:42.615 --> 24:43.814
We're gonna die out here.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.185
Nobody's dying on my watch.

24:50.756 --> 24:53.924
All we got to do is send
a distress signal up.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.259
Coast Guard will come

24:55.261 --> 24:56.560
and tow us to shore.

24:56.562 --> 24:58.662
(clicking)

25:02.935 --> 25:05.202
You got to be kidding me, brah.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.871
Must be a safety-- give it here.

25:06.873 --> 25:10.107
Sure, let the drunk guy
handle the firearm.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.509
Great idea.

25:11.511 --> 25:13.210
Everyone chill, I got this.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.551
Well, there's no missing that.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.524
I heard you got something.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.893
Yeah, Addison wasn't the only
person that Holm was spying on.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.028
Looks like he put spyware
onto over 1,000 machines.

25:32.164 --> 25:33.898
He was targeting other victims.

25:33.900 --> 25:37.568
Exactly, and it looks like
he may have selected one.

25:37.570 --> 25:40.571
He's got a folder with this
guy's name on it, Jason Putnam.

25:42.542 --> 25:43.908
Whoa, that's a lot of data.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.309
Over a terabyte.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.044
E-mails, financials,

25:47.046 --> 25:49.847
recorded phone calls, he even
has video and screen caps

25:49.849 --> 25:52.616
from a bunch
of hijacked camera feeds.

25:56.822 --> 25:58.923
Who is Jason Putnam?

25:58.925 --> 26:01.625
My name is Jason Putnam,

26:01.627 --> 26:04.795
and I have something to confess.

26:04.797 --> 26:07.732
Over the past year,

26:07.733 --> 26:10.668
while working
as a private financial advisor,

26:10.670 --> 26:14.672
I embezzled over $800,000.

26:14.674 --> 26:17.641
Mostly from elderly clients

26:17.643 --> 26:21.145
whom I believed were less likely
to detect the fraud.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.147
JERRY:
Jason Putnam posted

26:23.149 --> 26:24.949
this video to his profile
three days ago

26:24.951 --> 26:26.150
and it immediately
went viral.

26:26.152 --> 26:27.585
Uh-huh, so this guy's
robbing old folks

26:27.587 --> 26:28.886
for their live savings.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.721
I imagine the Internet
was not too kind.

26:30.723 --> 26:31.655
It was brutal.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.190
He was publically eviscerated.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.993
But since then, no one
has seen or heard from him.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.295
His family contacted HPD

26:37.296 --> 26:38.596
'cause they were concerned
about his mental state.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.030
He's currently classified

26:40.032 --> 26:41.765
as an "Endangered
Missing Adult."

26:41.767 --> 26:44.668
Okay, but clearly Putnam
didn't go missing on his own.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.303
I mean, Holm kidnapped him
and forced this confession.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.072
TOAST:
Guys, check this out.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.974
Found these on Holm's server.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.976
They're camera feeds
and they're live.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.088
All right, can we trace
where they're coming from?

26:55.089 --> 26:56.464
Yeah, sure,
but there's 17 of them,

26:56.465 --> 26:57.840
and they're coming
from all over the island.

26:57.841 --> 26:59.216
From what I can tell,
it's mostly abandoned buildings

26:59.218 --> 27:00.707
and vacant homes.

27:00.708 --> 27:02.197
Well, obviously he was
staking these places out.

27:02.198 --> 27:03.687
Maybe it's where he was
planning on taking his victims.

27:03.689 --> 27:05.723
That's what I was afraid of.
Check this out.

27:08.361 --> 27:09.960
That's a body.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.045
What is it?

27:28.046 --> 27:29.212
This is the fallout
to his confession.

27:29.215 --> 27:33.717
What do you think,
he was making Putnam watch it?

27:33.719 --> 27:35.719
STEVE:
That's exactly what I think.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.855
And then he left him
locked up in here

27:37.857 --> 27:39.156
with only one way out.

28:03.683 --> 28:05.282
Thought we had
lost you there, cuz.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.786
(groans) Get off me.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.320
What happened?

28:10.322 --> 28:12.256
You don't remember?

28:12.257 --> 28:14.191
We were just floating out there
on that life raft.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.560
And I spotted land.
That's right.

28:16.561 --> 28:18.928
You were so excited, you jumped
up and lost your balance.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.931
By the time we got you
back in the raft,

28:20.933 --> 28:23.000
you had swallowed so much water,
that you passed out.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.903
Doc had to do mouth to mouth
to get you breathing again.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.375
MAX:
Ah.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.243
Glad to see you back on
your feet, Captain.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.445
Where the hell are we?

28:34.447 --> 28:36.380
Now, that is a good question.

28:36.382 --> 28:39.249
My best bet is we're on one
of the uninhabited islands

28:39.251 --> 28:40.384
of the Hawaiian chain.

28:40.386 --> 28:43.320
Most likely Lehua.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.389
Lehua?

28:45.391 --> 28:50.194
Now, all we have to do is
survive until we get discovered.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.096
Fortunately, I had a have a
head start on building the fire.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.015
I did it
while you were unconscious.

28:54.016 --> 28:55.933
At least we'll be warm
while we starve to death.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.968
MAX:
Oh, nonsense.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.237
I also collected some crickets
and caterpillars

29:00.239 --> 29:02.005
for our dining pleasure.

29:02.007 --> 29:03.340
They're an excellent
source of protein.

29:05.511 --> 29:07.411
I grabbed what I could...

29:07.413 --> 29:09.012
before our ship burnt up.

29:09.014 --> 29:11.415
If we ration it,

29:11.417 --> 29:12.950
could last us a few days.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.352
Talk to me, what do we have?

29:17.456 --> 29:18.856
(sighs)

29:18.858 --> 29:20.057
Mochi balls.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.125
Love those.

29:21.127 --> 29:22.760
And a bottle of ouzo.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.967
Who's up for some sing-a-longs?

29:29.969 --> 29:31.535
MAX:
That sounds delightful.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.974
Sorry, cuz.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.176
If I die first,

29:39.178 --> 29:40.911
I want you to eat me.

29:41.847 --> 29:43.781
Nobody's gonna eat you.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.284
So what are you saying,
I'm not good enough for you?

29:47.286 --> 29:48.919
Why wouldn't you eat me?

29:56.162 --> 29:58.028
Guys, over here!

30:01.300 --> 30:02.332
Check it out,

30:02.334 --> 30:04.468
Doctor, regular MacGyver.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.236
Actually, it's basic physics.

30:06.238 --> 30:09.540
The lens focuses the light to
generate enough heat to burn.

30:09.542 --> 30:12.042
Now all we need to do
is stoke the flame.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.180
I'll do you one better, brah.

30:19.852 --> 30:22.352
Oh! Yeah! Whoa.

30:22.354 --> 30:26.089
It's always nice to have
flammable material.

30:26.091 --> 30:28.058
FLIPPA:
And alcohol.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.532
All right, thanks, dude.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.001
All right, so HPD checked
all the locations

30:38.003 --> 30:39.970
that Holm was surveilling,
no sign of Addison.

30:42.007 --> 30:45.008
Okay, so this guy, he abducts
Addison for a specific reason,

30:45.010 --> 30:46.610
but it's not 'cause
she's young and pretty.

30:46.612 --> 30:47.811
No.

30:47.812 --> 30:49.011
It's because she's got
something that she's hiding

30:49.014 --> 30:50.564
and this guy
wants to expose her.

30:50.565 --> 30:52.115
Exactly, that's what he does,
he prowls the Internet

30:52.117 --> 30:53.851
looking for victims
who have dark secrets

30:53.853 --> 30:55.953
and then he forces them
to confess 'cause...

30:55.955 --> 30:58.622
what, he's a vigilante
with a god complex.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.490
No, this guy's face
is all over the news.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.209
Okay, and that is why

31:02.210 --> 31:03.927
he didn't take her to
any of those spots, right?

31:03.929 --> 31:05.996
I mean, he's smart,
he knows we'd be on 'em.

31:05.998 --> 31:07.631
He's smart,
he's also a psychopath.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.900
I'm not looking forward to
seeing what this guy does

31:09.902 --> 31:11.902
now that his back's
against the wall.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.020
Please.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.155
I don't want to die.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.026
I'm not the one
who's a murderer.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.501
KONO:
This link was just posted

31:44.503 --> 31:46.036
to Addison's profile page.

31:46.037 --> 31:47.570
It's a Web stream.
It's about to go live.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.408
Toast?
I'm on it.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.978
My name is Addison Wells.

31:54.980 --> 31:59.449
As most of you know,
I was kidnapped last night.

31:59.451 --> 32:02.219
But what you don't know
is the reason why.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.588
For years now,
Toast, talk to me.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.956
I've been keeping a secret. He's got
the feed on a five-second relay.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.625
I thought I could put it It's being bounced
off proxy servers all over the world.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.093
run from it, put it behind me,
Well, can you trace it?

32:10.095 --> 32:12.062
but I wrong.
I could if I had a few hours.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.697
I moved to Hawaii...
Brah, we don't have a few hours.

32:13.698 --> 32:15.331
If we don't find this guy
by the end of this feed,

32:15.334 --> 32:16.878
...started a new life here,
this girl is as good as dead.

32:16.879 --> 32:18.423
and tried to be a good person. Yeah,
enough with the pressure, man.

32:18.424 --> 32:19.968
But it's all been a lie. And I haven't
even smoked my morning bowl yet.

32:19.972 --> 32:22.005
ADDISON:
The truth is

32:22.007 --> 32:24.441
I haven't been honest
about who I am

32:24.443 --> 32:28.345
and the mistakes
that I have made.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.113
And now I'm going to confess.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.315
We're running out of time.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.686
Five years ago in Pl...

32:35.688 --> 32:38.989
(playing upbeat song)

32:38.991 --> 32:40.290
What the hell just happened?

32:40.292 --> 32:42.159
She just got played off
by Fatso the Keyboard Cat.

32:42.161 --> 32:45.028
Somebody deliberately
knocked that feed offline.

32:45.030 --> 32:46.296
And that someone was me.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.065
Toast, what are you doing?

32:48.067 --> 32:49.266
I'm getting you your location

32:49.268 --> 32:51.702
the only way I know how.

32:51.704 --> 32:53.404
Holm can't reestablish
a connection

32:53.405 --> 32:55.105
without exposing his location.
It's genius.

32:55.107 --> 32:58.075
And what if he just decides
to kill this girl? What then?

32:58.077 --> 33:00.143
Then I guess
I'll look pretty dumb.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.215
This doesn't change anything.

33:05.217 --> 33:06.450
When that light goes back on,

33:06.452 --> 33:08.218
you say exactly
what I told you to.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.991
It worked.
He took the bait.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.092
Not so fast.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.626
I still have to zero in
on his location.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.228
How long?
17 seconds,

33:18.230 --> 33:20.297
give or take.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.399
ADDISON:
This is my confession.

33:22.401 --> 33:25.235
Five years ago
in Plymouth, Minnesota...

33:28.640 --> 33:30.507
...I was driving my car
late at night...

33:33.278 --> 33:34.745
when I struck a pedestrian,

33:34.747 --> 33:38.582
killing him instantly.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.517
In my statement,
I told the police

33:40.519 --> 33:43.086
that the victim stepped
into traffic

33:43.088 --> 33:46.323
and that I didn't have
enough time to brake,

33:46.325 --> 33:48.625
but that was a lie.

33:48.627 --> 33:52.496
The truth is...

33:52.498 --> 33:54.698
I wasn't even looking
at the road when it happened.

33:56.769 --> 34:00.037
(crying): I was on my phone,
reading a text.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.043
Because of my own carelessness,

34:06.045 --> 34:09.112
an innocent man died.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.150
There hasn't been a day
that's gone by

34:13.152 --> 34:14.785
that I haven't thought about it.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.122
I'm so sorry.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.098
Got him.

34:30.269 --> 34:34.771
(sobbing):
I wanted to tell his family.

34:34.773 --> 34:38.141
I even wrote the e-mail
that I was gonna send.

34:38.143 --> 34:40.610
But you never did, did you?

34:40.612 --> 34:42.112
Sorry.

34:42.114 --> 34:43.847
(crying continues)

34:43.849 --> 34:48.318
And now the world will see you
for what you really are:

34:48.320 --> 34:50.087
a coward and a liar.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.195
3236.

35:03.836 --> 35:05.168
You're letting me go?

35:05.170 --> 35:08.271
(soft chuckle)
No.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.739
Even if I did,

35:09.741 --> 35:12.109
there would be nothing left
to go back to, would there?

35:15.881 --> 35:18.315
But...

35:22.488 --> 35:24.354
...I will show you some mercy.

35:33.332 --> 35:36.299
(tires screeching,
sirens wailing)

35:36.301 --> 35:40.137
This is Officer Kalakua
requesting HPD and SWAT support.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.873
The address is
5625 Hoala Street in Waimalu.

35:45.544 --> 35:48.612
(gunshot in the distance)

36:02.427 --> 36:06.196
(groans, panting)

36:06.198 --> 36:08.198
(gun clicks)

36:30.722 --> 36:32.622
(Holm yelling in the distance)

36:32.624 --> 36:33.690
(panting)

36:43.802 --> 36:46.303
(screams)

36:46.305 --> 36:47.737
(groans)

36:47.739 --> 36:49.773
(whimpering)

36:49.775 --> 36:50.840
(Addison coughs, gasps)

36:50.842 --> 36:52.776
(grunting)

36:57.449 --> 36:59.482
(screams)

36:59.484 --> 37:01.351
(gasps, shouts)

37:01.353 --> 37:02.419
(screams)

37:07.526 --> 37:08.925
(yells)

37:08.927 --> 37:10.961
(groan, panting)

37:11.697 --> 37:12.696
(screams)

37:12.697 --> 37:13.696
(door slams in the distance)

37:13.699 --> 37:15.632
(panting)

37:17.903 --> 37:19.336
(grunting)

37:36.722 --> 37:37.787
We got blood.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.537
(gasps)

37:57.509 --> 37:58.775
You all right?
Are you hurt?

37:58.777 --> 38:00.844
(gasp)

38:00.846 --> 38:04.514
(distant gunshots)

38:15.560 --> 38:18.695
I've got you. It's all over now.

Dang, cuz.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.394
You got to perform a gig
at the shrimp truck.

39:24.396 --> 39:25.979
Pro bono?

39:25.980 --> 39:27.563
At least until you win
your first Grammy.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.432
(chuckles)

39:29.434 --> 39:30.767
Well, since we're
on the topic of regrets--

39:30.769 --> 39:33.937
you not pursuing your music--
I'll share mine.

39:33.939 --> 39:36.005
Years ago
I had the opportunity

39:36.007 --> 39:37.741
to participate
in Doctors Without Borders.

39:37.743 --> 39:40.910
It was a six month stint
in Mozambique,

39:40.912 --> 39:43.046
but I decided not to take it.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.515
Why not?

39:45.517 --> 39:49.052
Well, you know, dealing with
living, breathing patients

39:49.054 --> 39:51.888
isn't exactly my strong suit.

39:51.890 --> 39:55.024
That's why I took up a career
in forensic pathology.

39:55.026 --> 39:57.827
Apparently,
some people consider me

39:57.829 --> 39:59.562
awkward and off-putting.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.132
No, that's crazy.

40:02.134 --> 40:04.067
No way, Doc, not you.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.970
Thank you.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.638
And yourself, any regrets?

40:08.640 --> 40:10.707
Please.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.809
I'm a two-time felon.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.644
I own four businesses now.

40:14.646 --> 40:17.447
I got no regrets.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.048
FLIPPA:
Actually, cuz,

40:19.050 --> 40:21.718
business number four
is currently resting

40:21.720 --> 40:23.119
at the bottom of the Pacific.

40:23.121 --> 40:25.588
It's a small setback.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.624
When the insurance cash kick in,

40:27.626 --> 40:29.826
(chuckle)
we'll be back in action.

40:29.828 --> 40:31.494
<i> Thong Magnet Two?</i>

40:31.496 --> 40:34.097
Featuring the music stylings

40:34.099 --> 40:36.132
of Shawn "Flippa" Tupuola.

40:36.134 --> 40:37.467
(softly):
Yeah.

40:37.469 --> 40:38.968
(laughs)

40:38.970 --> 40:40.837
Well, I think we should
call it a night.

40:40.839 --> 40:43.173
Come 6:00 a.m. the sun
is gonna be blazing.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.647
Good night, Doc.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.048
Good night, Flippa.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.149
Good night, Kamekona.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.585
Good night, Doc.

40:55.587 --> 40:56.586
Good night, little cuz.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.888
Good night, big cuz.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.857
Good night, stars.

41:00.859 --> 41:04.127
Good night, moon.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.462
(fireworks popping)

41:07.732 --> 41:08.865
What was that?

41:08.867 --> 41:09.933
It's a signal.

41:09.935 --> 41:11.568
Somebody found us.

41:11.570 --> 41:12.502
We're saved.

41:18.243 --> 41:20.109
Actually, I believe
those are fireworks.

41:20.111 --> 41:22.178
KAMEKONA:
Fireworks?

41:27.619 --> 41:29.819
Look, Cheryl, natives.

41:30.789 --> 41:31.855
CHERYL:
Aloha.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.862
"Uninhabited" you said.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.196
There's a resort
on this island?

41:40.198 --> 41:42.665
Apparently so.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.834
And judging from where
those fireworks are coming from,

41:44.836 --> 41:46.536
I'd say it's less
than 100 yards away.

41:49.107 --> 41:51.708
Oops.

41:54.079 --> 41:55.778
(video game fart noises)

41:55.780 --> 41:57.547
WOMAN:
Gross.

41:57.549 --> 41:58.648
(fart noises continue)

41:58.650 --> 42:00.283
WOMAN:
Oh, no, not again.

42:00.285 --> 42:02.552
Okay, how am I supposed to poop
on the skateboard kids

42:02.554 --> 42:03.686
when they're moving so fast?

42:03.688 --> 42:06.222
This-- it's impossible.

42:06.224 --> 42:08.591
Well, you got to fill up
on the meatball sub.

42:08.593 --> 42:09.592
Larger bowel capacity,

42:09.594 --> 42:11.828
bigger blast radius.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.997
Oh.

42:13.999 --> 42:16.232
Awesome. Awesome.

42:16.234 --> 42:18.167
WOMAN:
Gross.

42:18.169 --> 42:19.969
Ew, penguin poop.

42:19.970 --> 42:21.770
Hey, again, I'm sorry
about this morning.

42:21.773 --> 42:24.140
I didn't mean to cramp
your style, but, uh, you know,

42:24.142 --> 42:25.608
it was worth it, right?

42:25.610 --> 42:27.444
Yeah, no problem.

42:27.445 --> 42:29.279
Now we all get to go
have chicken and waffles.

42:29.281 --> 42:30.179
(video game noises continue)

42:30.181 --> 42:32.882
I just feel bad that

42:32.884 --> 42:34.784
they didn't have room
for everyone

42:34.786 --> 42:36.185
in first class.

42:36.187 --> 42:38.288
Oh, don't worry about
those guys-- they're fine.

42:38.290 --> 42:39.656
(video game noises continue)

42:39.657 --> 42:41.023
WOMAN:
I got pooped on again.

42:41.026 --> 42:43.092
(baby crying)

42:54.739 --> 42:56.172
(sighs)

42:56.174 --> 42:57.807
(snoring softly)

42:57.809 --> 42:58.875
What the hell.

43:03.315 --> 43:05.081
(sighs)
