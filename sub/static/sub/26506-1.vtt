02:51.589 --> 02:53.234
Come with me, Miss Camille.

03:09.804 --> 03:12.859
Do you think there's more fire and depth
in the poetry?

03:15.586 --> 03:16.586
No...

03:17.782 --> 03:20.468
You're wrong, there's fire there.

03:20.994 --> 03:24.234
I took his 'Inferno' to do something
with small figures.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.734
I wanted them to swarm everywhere,
on either side of the gate.

03:31.421 --> 03:32.819
See these subjects...

03:35.008 --> 03:37.460
They illustrate the love
between Paolo and Francesca...

03:41.249 --> 03:43.929
I'm not sure about leaving the kiss
in the middle of all the damned.

03:46.311 --> 03:49.355
They are far too happy
and much too joyful for that!

03:50.440 --> 03:51.440
Yes.

03:52.859 --> 03:54.527
She's the betrayal...

03:55.028 --> 03:56.342
of trust.

03:57.822 --> 03:59.006
What about him?

03:59.532 --> 04:00.865
He's the lover...

04:02.452 --> 04:03.982
A determined lover.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.164
An impatient one!

04:21.021 --> 04:23.850
Seen in profile, your Dante
looks like a bird of prey.

04:31.527 --> 04:33.676
Could he be enjoying their suffering?

04:34.859 --> 04:35.988
I don't know...

04:36.945 --> 04:37.988
Ask him!

04:41.783 --> 04:44.011
You're more compassionate than Dante.

04:46.871 --> 04:48.418
What makes you say that?

04:49.457 --> 04:52.377
I say it because your door is closed...

04:53.378 --> 04:55.046
It's not open to The Inferno.

04:55.213 --> 04:57.332
Yes, but the door is part of The Inferno.

05:02.136 --> 05:05.590
It looks as if the gate has been
added as an afterthought.

05:06.224 --> 05:08.222
Yet I spent a year on the drawings.

05:13.690 --> 05:15.793
It's in the earth that I find my shapes...

05:18.653 --> 05:21.113
and I still have so many subjects to imagine.

05:22.535 --> 05:23.855
So many subjects.

05:28.579 --> 05:31.394
If I could be a modest presence by your side...

06:03.072 --> 06:05.616
I have little liking for modesty in my work...

06:06.993 --> 06:08.261
but...

06:09.043 --> 06:10.730
always tell me what you think.

06:10.926 --> 06:12.121
I'll never hold back!

06:13.124 --> 06:15.590
And you'll help me fight against prejudice.

06:15.828 --> 06:16.828
Yes.

06:18.402 --> 06:20.988
Your 'Gates of Hell' was not done
to edify young girls!

06:22.300 --> 06:25.303
Even though all these creatures
are destroyed by desire...

07:13.559 --> 07:15.885
Sir, the models are here.

07:17.355 --> 07:20.274
The other Abruzzesi, Adele's sister...
Is she here?

07:20.441 --> 07:22.193
- She was called.
- But is she here?

07:22.393 --> 07:23.393
She's coming.

07:24.695 --> 07:27.510
- And 'lovely feet, lovely thighs'?
- Therese Fontaine?

07:28.282 --> 07:31.503
- The beautiful redhead?
- Miss Octavie is here.

07:32.510 --> 07:34.330
The model for Pierre Louys?

07:34.550 --> 07:37.083
He's here.
But Mr Louys is going to be angry.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.293
No matter.

07:39.794 --> 07:41.796
- Shall I send them in?
- Yes, send them in.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.114
Yes, sir.

07:44.090 --> 07:46.551
Tell them it'll be a crawling day.

07:46.956 --> 07:49.762
I want clenched hands, twisted mouths,
heaving breasts...

07:49.929 --> 07:52.268
as if the demon was going to seize them.

08:04.902 --> 08:07.541
The top of your belly...
raise it a bit...

08:08.739 --> 08:09.949
That's it.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.432
Like this.

08:31.137 --> 08:33.589
Don't complain.
No 'yes, buts'!

08:33.768 --> 08:35.450
You're beautiful, but don't take advantage of it.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.143
You're the one who's taking advantage.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.014
<i>Leading the hierarchy of materials is gold...</i>

09:15.181 --> 09:18.184
<i>then bronze, stone, wood,</i>

09:18.799 --> 09:19.971
<i>and lastly, clay.</i>

09:21.020 --> 09:23.168
<i>But I'm reversing this hierarchy.</i>

09:24.315 --> 09:26.402
<i>Here, clay has taken first place.</i>

09:30.684 --> 09:32.114
These are my conditions...

09:33.532 --> 09:35.534
My house is open to you...

09:36.202 --> 09:37.870
Come and have lunch...

09:38.117 --> 09:41.266
and you'll make sketches as we take notes.

09:41.813 --> 09:43.914
It'll work out well.
That's enough.

09:44.242 --> 09:46.712
A few short sessions, Victor?

09:47.004 --> 09:49.203
No, I won't pose!

09:51.842 --> 09:53.946
I do not even want to see a pencil!

09:57.438 --> 09:58.461
I got it!

09:59.308 --> 10:00.664
Do you know how?

10:03.742 --> 10:06.242
Juliette Drouet managed to get
a short pose for you.

10:06.429 --> 10:08.227
She enticed him into the living room.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.687
And what did I do then?

10:12.029 --> 10:15.718
You measured his skull with callipers
without him even noticing.

10:17.576 --> 10:18.796
Better than that!

10:19.453 --> 10:22.748
I questioned the proportions
of his bust of David d'Angers.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.959
I thought he was going to kill me.

10:25.187 --> 10:26.877
He rushed up to the bust in question...

10:27.044 --> 10:29.281
...and stared at it as though
he were hypnotised.

10:29.964 --> 10:32.968
It was then I grabbed the chance
to measure his skull.

10:34.385 --> 10:36.117
That story doesn't make sense.

10:36.906 --> 10:39.867
He would never have allowed you
to attack David d'Angers!

10:41.475 --> 10:42.977
Well then...

10:43.269 --> 10:46.105
I paid the little maid that he fancied...

10:47.064 --> 10:49.132
...and so obtained my 45 minutes.

10:51.110 --> 10:52.778
I think it was Juliette

10:53.237 --> 10:55.489
who got you the short pose session.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.783
And after meals, when he was sleeping...

10:57.992 --> 11:00.036
you've carefully taken his measurements.

11:00.304 --> 11:01.620
During the meals

11:02.121 --> 11:05.617
Juliette did me the favour of never
having me sit in the same place.

11:05.695 --> 11:07.749
So I was able to get all the necessary angles.

11:09.211 --> 11:12.923
But how am I to treat the head

11:13.424 --> 11:14.884
of this giant of our age?

11:15.051 --> 11:16.051
How?

11:18.137 --> 11:19.820
Will this be our little conundrum?

11:21.015 --> 11:22.413
Would you like that?

11:59.762 --> 12:03.641
The programs, premises and staff,
are all indispensable.

12:04.266 --> 12:07.645
Let's separate school from church...
both have everything to gain.

12:07.812 --> 12:09.855
The church may need a lot of persuading.

12:11.190 --> 12:13.359
We're campaigning against ignorance.

12:15.945 --> 12:17.554
You're in such a rush all the time!

12:23.369 --> 12:25.820
So I don't have time
to forget what I've just seen.

12:29.959 --> 12:32.374
So I learn to work from memory.

12:39.093 --> 12:41.512
What could be nobler than educating the people?

12:42.221 --> 12:46.559
And to establish the French language
in every corner of France...

12:46.725 --> 12:48.602
...that's a truly beautiful thing.

12:59.238 --> 13:00.948
Don't think he looks down on you...

13:01.115 --> 13:04.618
if all you get from him
is 'good evening Mr Rodin'

13:04.827 --> 13:06.531
or 'Good morning Mr Rodin'.

13:11.417 --> 13:12.835
I don't think about it at all...

13:13.836 --> 13:15.648
and I wouldn't care, anyway.

13:18.424 --> 13:20.765
I just want to capture the real Hugo.

13:50.581 --> 13:52.031
You seem unhappy.

13:58.593 --> 14:00.546
Hugo's shown me the door.

14:02.570 --> 14:04.570
As far as he's concerned, it's finished.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.367
It's always been like that.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.016
With the Bronze Age,
I'd been accused of cheating...

14:13.145 --> 14:15.303
of moulding directly on the body of my model.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.850
I was able to circulate a photo
to show the differences...

14:21.195 --> 14:22.988
It was useless.

14:24.782 --> 14:26.408
The damage was done.

14:32.206 --> 14:33.707
It's my fault.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.713
There's too much life in my sculpture!

14:49.120 --> 14:50.627
Well don't blame Hugo.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.534
Miss Drouet is very ill.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.260
There's something of a tiger about him

15:04.113 --> 15:05.159
Or of a lion.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.987
So I didn't miss it then!

15:10.544 --> 15:13.104
Because Hugo has a great animal presence.

17:42.938 --> 17:44.356
What are you writing?

17:44.565 --> 17:47.445
This questionnaire that the English
call 'confession album'. Heard of it?

17:47.484 --> 17:48.609
Yes, I know...

17:49.486 --> 17:51.016
But I won't be filling in one.

17:51.947 --> 17:53.188
I'll do it though.

17:59.371 --> 18:01.086
My main occupation?

18:02.666 --> 18:04.793
I'd say... carving stone.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.178
'Doing nothing.'

18:08.547 --> 18:10.132
You don't do anything?

18:10.758 --> 18:13.010
If you start with lies...

18:14.484 --> 18:16.609
What would I want to be if I wasn't who I am?

18:18.390 --> 18:20.309
You'd want to be Joan of Arc.

18:20.813 --> 18:22.242
A cab horse.

18:24.031 --> 18:26.648
I don't like that drivers treat them so badly.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.734
My favourite artist?

18:33.906 --> 18:35.484
Auguste Rodin.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.034
'Myself'.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.204
If I'd stopped to think about it...

18:40.913 --> 18:42.372
I'd have realised that.

18:42.698 --> 18:46.249
For which personal defect
would you have the most tolerance?

18:46.398 --> 18:47.703
A kiss first.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.672
You rat!...
You only wanted to shut me up!

19:18.867 --> 19:20.369
Go on... answer!

19:21.870 --> 19:23.648
Your unbridled liking for women.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.609
My crazy love for Camille, you mean.

19:28.718 --> 19:30.523
My crazy love for Camille.

20:54.546 --> 20:55.749
Look...

20:56.548 --> 20:58.634
A snail has crawled along here.

21:01.470 --> 21:03.972
Look at the pattern of the track it left.

21:04.473 --> 21:05.567
How pretty it is.

21:07.794 --> 21:09.333
How it shines.

21:46.473 --> 21:50.044
I haven't told you...
I saw Dr Vivier about my heart.

21:51.895 --> 21:53.355
I didn't tell you about his horse...

21:53.522 --> 21:56.108
The one with its tongue hanging out all the time?

21:56.528 --> 21:59.048
On Tuesday, there was a crowd around it.
They were all laughing.

22:00.821 --> 22:02.505
It really got Dr Vivier angry.

22:03.532 --> 22:05.020
He wasn't able to move.

22:06.118 --> 22:08.036
So, he pulled out his scalpel...

22:08.203 --> 22:10.716
and sliced off the end of the tongue!

22:11.707 --> 22:12.927
You don't say!

22:16.586 --> 22:18.677
It won't affect your appetite, I hope!

22:19.247 --> 22:22.270
Not for a nice bacon omelet
with a big glass of white wine!

22:44.865 --> 22:46.731
Do you remember the Sonian Forest?

22:47.427 --> 22:50.620
One day, it was raining hard,
and you protected me with your umbrella.

22:50.787 --> 22:51.794
Oh yes!

22:52.656 --> 22:55.356
I opened your colour box.
You didn't start.

22:56.122 --> 22:57.669
You said you were too slow.

22:57.878 --> 23:00.518
Because I always told myself
that the sun painted faster than me!

23:02.382 --> 23:04.217
And then you went back to Paris...

23:05.385 --> 23:07.262
and one day when I was thinking of you...

23:07.804 --> 23:09.806
I started to hum this song...

23:10.182 --> 23:12.311
that we sang together.
Remember?

23:14.269 --> 23:17.314
<i>She had a wooden leg</i>

23:17.981 --> 23:21.318
<i>And so that it wasn't noticed</i>

23:22.402 --> 23:24.571
<i>She had put underneath</i>

23:24.738 --> 23:27.157
<i>discs of rubber</i>

23:27.324 --> 23:29.534
<i>She had a wooden leg</i>

23:29.701 --> 23:31.995
<i>And because she wore stockings</i>

23:32.329 --> 23:34.331
<i>Anyone who hadn't felt her</i>

23:34.498 --> 23:36.597
<i>Would never have suspected</i>

23:37.834 --> 23:42.214
<i>Wood, wood, she had a wooden leg</i>

23:44.966 --> 23:47.386
We lived our best years in Brussels...

23:47.820 --> 23:48.820
Rose.

23:49.488 --> 23:51.034
And the wet cloths...

23:51.723 --> 23:54.073
on your scale models, remember?

23:54.738 --> 23:56.042
I'd learned well, hadn't I?

23:58.313 --> 23:59.731
You know...

24:00.232 --> 24:01.733
I was thinking...

24:06.029 --> 24:07.745
if I'd continued to paint...

24:09.533 --> 24:12.495
my paintings at best would have
been like a minor Corot, no?

24:13.245 --> 24:14.261
What would you say?

24:14.830 --> 24:16.414
Why ask me?

24:16.581 --> 24:18.375
- Are you kidding again?
- No.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.167
You know, Rose...

24:25.636 --> 24:27.355
I'm not much better than you.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.066
I'm just a labourer who learned to read.

24:32.889 --> 24:34.105
Take Dante...

24:35.559 --> 24:36.878
He's like a sculptor...

24:37.597 --> 24:39.238
But he sculpts with words.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.003
Know what I mean?

24:43.775 --> 24:44.972
You don't.

24:54.703 --> 24:56.288
'Dear Mr Rodin...

24:56.913 --> 25:00.019
the feeling that emerges
is that of boundless despair.

25:00.964 --> 25:02.198
Burghers who are martyrs

25:02.284 --> 25:04.159
don't walk to their death
like criminals!'

25:08.550 --> 25:09.925
Yet they look great.

25:14.667 --> 25:18.159
It hasn't stopped the people of Calais
feeling otherwise.

25:22.606 --> 25:24.558
Whether it's the Chamber of Commerce...

25:25.025 --> 25:26.985
...lace manufacturers,
shipowners...

25:27.152 --> 25:29.946
Not to forget the municipal choir!
All have criticised me.

25:30.739 --> 25:32.240
Without exception.

25:34.326 --> 25:36.661
<i>It's not how we saw our glorious citizens...</i>

25:36.828 --> 25:38.580
<i>going to the camp of the King of England!</i>

25:38.817 --> 25:41.239
<i>Their sunken looks do not reflect our beliefs.</i>

25:42.459 --> 25:45.591
<i>To have Eustache so downcast, is distressing.</i>

25:47.130 --> 25:50.550
<i>He no longer has the strength to wear
the huge rope around his neck...</i>

25:51.551 --> 25:54.262
<i>which seems to be protecting him from laryngitis.</i>

25:55.764 --> 25:58.599
I'll have to ask Geffroy
to write to them, to defend me.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.763
My French isn't refined enough for that.

26:05.148 --> 26:07.646
He will write that they are racked with sadness.

26:08.235 --> 26:10.463
Which is the inescapable characteristic
that marks all great works.

26:10.487 --> 26:13.330
'Inescapable', that's good.
Make sure not to forget it.

26:15.492 --> 26:17.577
They've just left the city.

26:18.578 --> 26:21.378
Their proud posture before the king,
is something that will come later.

26:23.959 --> 26:26.711
That's what gives the group
this impression of starting to walk.

26:26.878 --> 26:28.129
Of motion.

26:29.297 --> 26:31.901
Geffroy should talk of motion as well.

26:36.388 --> 26:37.901
Go on... walk with them.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.017
Walk with them!

26:41.893 --> 26:42.893
Go on!

26:45.680 --> 26:47.139
Go on... walk with them!

26:47.315 --> 26:49.603
Their council doesn't care about motion.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.492
When they've been cast...

26:57.659 --> 26:59.536
...you'll see them at eye level.

26:59.703 --> 27:01.814
- Or higher.
- Higher?

27:14.718 --> 27:16.892
But I must be able to do it exactly how I want...

27:19.014 --> 27:21.174
...as all I'm interested in,
is creating a masterpiece.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.525
Those lovely people of Calais!

27:45.081 --> 27:46.396
Mr Rodin...

27:47.083 --> 27:48.668
Ah, it's Estager.

27:51.087 --> 27:53.552
Will your Balzac have a southern flavour?

27:53.757 --> 27:55.717
You won't laugh when you see the fellow I've got.

27:55.842 --> 27:59.054
- Is your fellow a writer, too?
- No, he's a teamster.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.896
I had to find someone with Balzac's physique.

28:02.057 --> 28:03.850
I couldn't work from illustrations.

28:04.559 --> 28:06.217
And he was born here in Touraine.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.114
So this would be the best place to find him.

28:10.006 --> 28:11.006
Hello.

28:18.279 --> 28:20.116
I want you bare to the waist.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.833
- You've already modelled all those?!
- Yes.

28:24.208 --> 28:26.380
Look, I did all these too.

28:31.252 --> 28:32.755
It's crazy how quick you are!

28:34.381 --> 28:36.021
All the same, I still haven't got Balzac.

28:38.927 --> 28:40.669
I can't pretend that I have.

28:41.137 --> 28:42.591
Are you setting up?

28:48.895 --> 28:51.606
- Where do you want the basin?
- Put it there.

29:02.117 --> 29:03.117
All right?

29:05.620 --> 29:07.163
Everything all right?

29:07.330 --> 29:08.486
Yes, fine thanks.

29:09.833 --> 29:10.861
All right?

29:24.931 --> 29:26.306
Turn sideways.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.006
Look at me.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.217
You're making fun of me.

30:15.899 --> 30:17.201
Turn around.

30:48.193 --> 30:49.432
Face me.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.779
My costume's cute, eh?

31:12.038 --> 31:13.038
Yes...

31:13.873 --> 31:15.458
But not as cute as you.

31:16.751 --> 31:18.514
It was so nice of you to buy...

31:18.878 --> 31:21.172
this bathing costume that I asked for.

31:21.673 --> 31:23.800
The sales girls were greatly amused.

31:25.468 --> 31:27.232
You can make me do incredible things.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.318
I would've loved to have seen that!

31:40.108 --> 31:42.110
Tonight, if you've had a good day's work...

31:44.779 --> 31:46.114
Come and kiss me.

31:49.576 --> 31:50.756
Kiss you again?!

31:51.202 --> 31:53.733
My mother never kissed me.
With you, it never stops.

31:54.122 --> 31:56.499
- If you touch me, I'll scream.
- Really?

31:57.208 --> 31:58.960
Come here and kiss me, right now!

31:59.919 --> 32:01.629
- Come and kiss me!
- No!

32:01.796 --> 32:03.631
Come here and kiss me, right now!

32:22.818 --> 32:24.092
<i>My dear obstinate girl...</i>

32:26.029 --> 32:28.364
<i>I don't even see you in the studio any more.</i>

32:50.136 --> 32:51.545
Where were you the other night?

32:56.434 --> 32:58.102
I looked for you everywhere.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.342
You keep walking away.

33:04.734 --> 33:05.734
Camille!

33:08.613 --> 33:10.592
When you run off, I can't work anymore.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.742
Do you know why I run off?

33:13.159 --> 33:16.037
Yes.
Because you're an evil deity.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.662
Or maybe you want a notarized contract...

33:20.272 --> 33:22.752
where I declare you'll be my only pupil.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.631
That's not enough, and you know it.

33:29.384 --> 33:31.344
I'll take you to Italy, I promise.

33:33.596 --> 33:34.795
And we'll live together..

33:35.765 --> 33:37.266
And after, I'll marry you.

33:37.725 --> 33:39.061
Would that be enough?

33:40.068 --> 33:41.771
I love you passionately, Camille.

33:44.273 --> 33:47.959
Write me the contract now, and sign it.

33:48.653 --> 33:49.653
Go on!

33:53.616 --> 33:54.725
We'll start again. Write.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.123
1. Sole or exclusive pupil,
whichever you like.

34:01.416 --> 34:05.002
Even though I know you won't find
another artist as talented as me...

34:07.422 --> 34:09.966
2. Introduction to all your family.

34:12.217 --> 34:15.596
3. Strict promise to take me to Italy.

34:18.099 --> 34:20.893
4. And 'after', as you put it,
you'll marry me.

34:21.060 --> 34:24.147
In other words, promise of marriage.
Write 'promise of marriage'.

34:24.731 --> 34:26.043
Promise of marriage.

34:27.483 --> 34:28.130
There.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.652
And 5, do not forget to swear to be faithful.

34:36.951 --> 34:39.370
There... it's signed.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.552
'Faithful' only has one 'L'.

34:45.871 --> 34:47.879
I can see where you have difficulties.

34:51.395 --> 34:52.434
I nearly forgot...

34:52.800 --> 34:54.427
You can offer me a marble figurine...

34:54.594 --> 34:56.371
...if Miss Camille deigns to accept it.

34:56.606 --> 34:58.005
I'll add to it myself.

35:25.208 --> 35:27.001
You just improved my 'Thought'.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.309
And you can visit me 4 times a month.

35:33.333 --> 35:35.216
Without a contract, that's worthless.

35:39.013 --> 35:40.932
I know you won't have respect for anything.

35:42.833 --> 35:44.872
Your servant Rose is far too amenable.

35:47.438 --> 35:49.598
As you've said... you'll never risk
being tyrranised.

35:51.859 --> 35:53.403
You're quite mistaken.

35:57.323 --> 36:01.215
And since you love me passionately,
you can put that into the contract.

36:16.843 --> 36:18.094
Thanks.

36:37.700 --> 36:38.997
Higher? Lower?

36:39.615 --> 36:40.676
Higher.

36:42.493 --> 36:43.578
There.

36:45.872 --> 36:47.153
Plaster.

36:57.008 --> 36:59.218
Put it there.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.429
There.

37:21.828 --> 37:22.922
Take it.

37:23.910 --> 37:24.994
Take it!

37:44.648 --> 37:45.812
He's coming alive...

37:49.769 --> 37:53.133
You'll soon know Balzac as if
you'd lived with him for years.

37:56.817 --> 37:58.437
And you...?
Will I soon know you?

38:04.367 --> 38:06.094
You've dented the forehead nicely...

38:06.369 --> 38:09.055
and pouted the lower lip slightly...
That works well.

38:15.670 --> 38:16.796
Like that?

38:29.976 --> 38:32.305
I'll leave his face alone for now...

38:33.729 --> 38:35.851
and start work on the body.

38:37.525 --> 38:38.937
With that gross belly of his!

38:48.411 --> 38:49.704
At last!

38:54.500 --> 38:56.605
- Monet!
- Rodin!

39:00.256 --> 39:01.549
Hello, Paul.

39:03.277 --> 39:06.303
You realise you both have refusals in common!

39:06.554 --> 39:08.973
You've been refused 3 times by the Academy.

39:09.238 --> 39:11.613
Paul has to settle for refusals.

39:12.449 --> 39:15.404
Those eunuchs at the Academy are jackasses.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.316
Gutless wonders.

39:17.441 --> 39:19.277
I don't know about jackasses...

39:19.358 --> 39:21.488
But you're right.
They don't teach you anything.

39:21.902 --> 39:24.488
Nothing at all about modelling or light.

39:54.185 --> 39:55.394
Thanks.

40:00.483 --> 40:02.401
Your bronze that's in my studio...

40:03.110 --> 40:04.980
...is truly alive.

40:06.371 --> 40:10.308
How do you explain to them
that there's no flesh in their ideas?!

40:22.004 --> 40:23.005
Cezanne!

40:25.341 --> 40:26.342
Cezanne!

40:37.654 --> 40:39.201
At 40, I was a nobody.

40:41.023 --> 40:43.025
They didn't want my 'Man with a Broken Nose'...

40:43.359 --> 40:44.944
...refused my 'Saint John'.

40:45.561 --> 40:48.318
And competitions for monuments...
refusals and regrets, every time!

40:48.447 --> 40:50.324
Take my advice, Cezanne...

40:50.658 --> 40:52.076
Don't listen to anyone!

40:52.451 --> 40:53.967
Get back to work.

40:55.037 --> 40:56.811
We only find beauty in work.

40:57.164 --> 40:58.749
Without it, we're buggered.

41:00.334 --> 41:02.503
Please get up!

41:15.057 --> 41:17.701
I'm sorry... I'm a bit shaken up.

41:17.977 --> 41:18.977
Gentlemen...

41:19.645 --> 41:22.303
Let's sit down to eat...
Clemenceau will join us later.

41:31.323 --> 41:34.108
When I say that I shook your hand...

41:46.505 --> 41:48.716
You've helped me to understand light...

41:48.883 --> 41:52.386
and clouds, and cathedrals too,
that I've always been so fond of.

41:53.095 --> 41:54.930
It's magnificent, Monet.

42:07.076 --> 42:08.611
It looks like real flesh.

42:11.264 --> 42:13.279
Look at all those little waves.

42:13.908 --> 42:15.147
Light...

42:16.035 --> 42:17.303
Unimaginable...

42:18.686 --> 42:19.818
Wonderful!

42:23.626 --> 42:24.919
Touch it.

42:29.048 --> 42:30.216
Feel that?

42:31.258 --> 42:34.282
Just tiny random bumps...

42:36.847 --> 42:38.876
That's what makes the marble come to life.

42:42.061 --> 42:44.521
All these wonderful little facets.

42:46.357 --> 42:48.954
You could believe they were petrified
under caresses and kisses.

42:53.948 --> 42:55.407
There's been no one like the Greeks...

42:55.431 --> 42:57.871
...to display this adoration
for the beauty of the human body.

43:27.212 --> 43:29.025
I'd like to make you a proposition...

43:29.692 --> 43:31.345
but I don't want you to take it amiss.

43:33.314 --> 43:35.556
- Your beautiful girl with the sheaf...
- Tell me.

43:37.616 --> 43:39.111
I'd like to use it for...

43:39.259 --> 43:40.494
Another version?

43:41.048 --> 43:42.118
No, not at all.

43:42.822 --> 43:45.220
I wouldn't want to change
the position of the arms...

43:45.708 --> 43:47.167
nor that of the legs, either.

43:47.334 --> 43:48.454
You're flattering me.

43:49.420 --> 43:52.150
Take her if you want,
but she's not leaving your studio.

43:55.634 --> 43:57.428
You remember our contract?

43:58.012 --> 44:00.973
'You can offer me a marble figurine...

44:01.140 --> 44:04.226
...if Miss Camille
deigns to accept it'.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.751
- Remember?
- Yes, that's right.

44:07.938 --> 44:10.065
So? Agree?

44:11.587 --> 44:13.068
Let's say that it'll be...

44:13.235 --> 44:14.650
...a kind of homage.

44:17.531 --> 44:19.366
The homage of a master to his pupil.

44:19.665 --> 44:21.744
You know very well that you're no longer a pupil.

44:25.759 --> 44:27.583
I have an idea that I'd like to try...

44:29.084 --> 44:31.072
Have your girl coming out of a rock.

44:33.380 --> 44:35.049
What happens after that?

44:35.466 --> 44:38.093
She offers her right hand to my girl.

44:38.594 --> 44:41.263
For that, your girl will have to like her.

44:42.181 --> 44:43.891
And if she doesn't like her?

44:47.198 --> 44:49.688
She'll smash her skull with her right hand!

44:59.782 --> 45:01.409
You'll be my best pupil.

45:02.701 --> 45:05.371
Feel free to ask my advice.

45:06.789 --> 45:09.573
Can you feel my desire to do that
as soon as possible?

45:17.683 --> 45:18.683
<i>Camille...</i>

45:19.987 --> 45:22.011
<i>It's months since you left for England.</i>

45:23.886 --> 45:25.015
<i>I weep.</i>

45:26.745 --> 45:28.519
<i>You've no idea how I suffer.</i>

45:29.847 --> 45:32.550
<i>Everything has become insipid
and indifferent to me.</i>

45:34.815 --> 45:35.943
<i>Have pity on me!</i>

45:37.027 --> 45:38.570
<i>Pity, my darling!</i>

45:55.495 --> 45:58.261
Fortunately, night prevents you from working.

45:59.495 --> 46:00.495
Yes...

46:02.144 --> 46:04.513
Except that even at night,
my 'Danaide' pursues me!

46:04.680 --> 46:06.974
She's like you...
she seems exhausted.

46:10.019 --> 46:11.675
I know, but how else would I do it?

46:14.058 --> 46:16.792
Her back should be shuddering, throbbing...

46:18.472 --> 46:19.945
I have to bring it to life.

46:20.792 --> 46:22.072
It's flesh...

46:22.347 --> 46:24.948
and you know that with flesh,
we're never finished.

46:27.792 --> 46:30.956
When I start again at dawn,
she'll be happy to see me.

46:39.590 --> 46:40.924
Forgive me, Jessie...

46:41.347 --> 46:44.136
...for burdening you
about my letters to England...

46:46.013 --> 46:47.431
But Camille didn't reply.

46:47.698 --> 46:50.476
At least you were getting news of her,
thanks to me.

46:50.815 --> 46:53.580
When she found out, she was furious.

46:56.940 --> 46:59.050
I wanted to join her, but she refused.

47:01.862 --> 47:03.363
I was desperate.

47:03.768 --> 47:06.026
Did you know she teaches sculpture?

47:06.366 --> 47:09.010
And how did she hijacked my students?

47:09.495 --> 47:11.705
She told them that she would give lessons...

47:12.049 --> 47:15.432
...just as well and cheaper
than Rodin himself!

47:17.541 --> 47:18.775
She told them that?!

47:27.262 --> 47:28.889
Fine. Thanks, Jessie.

47:29.496 --> 47:31.619
Come on, let's get back to work.

47:52.519 --> 47:53.713
You don't answer?

47:59.294 --> 48:01.421
Why all those months in England?

48:02.775 --> 48:04.275
Once I wrote to you...

48:04.807 --> 48:08.519
'You are a good and honest person
in the admirable work you do.'

48:08.721 --> 48:10.736
But otherwise, you're like your Paul...

48:12.416 --> 48:14.502
Always wanting to dominate your world.

48:15.189 --> 48:17.187
I know I can be cantankerous!

48:17.525 --> 48:21.299
Paul must have been fed up with you,
to have gone looking for clay for you...

48:21.942 --> 48:23.385
Like the whole family, by the way.

48:23.944 --> 48:25.737
'Go and find clay for her!'

48:25.946 --> 48:28.031
'Camille needs it for her work.'

48:28.198 --> 48:30.534
At sixteen, I was already a regular tyrant.

48:40.961 --> 48:43.111
Do you remember when we were at Islette?

48:46.091 --> 48:48.088
You fell asleep with your mouth on my teat.

48:52.385 --> 48:55.525
And we did all those tricks
with the Calais figures!

48:57.269 --> 48:59.187
No more tricks?

48:59.924 --> 49:01.330
I hope so.

49:03.191 --> 49:05.193
We were beautiful sculptors.

49:07.863 --> 49:10.291
You were my symbol of joy.

49:11.491 --> 49:12.783
So what now?

49:15.203 --> 49:16.830
Now, I'm a symbol of doubt...

49:16.997 --> 49:19.082
...drawn by a child.

49:20.083 --> 49:21.447
How will you handle that?

49:21.793 --> 49:23.712
I'm sure I still can!

49:28.800 --> 49:31.053
I'm moving back to Villa Payen.

49:32.512 --> 49:34.014
You'll come and see me?

50:11.691 --> 50:13.762
The Academy inspector wants me to clothe them!

50:13.929 --> 50:15.639
Whatever for?

50:17.182 --> 50:18.684
You only have to drape them.

50:18.934 --> 50:20.323
You're sure to do it nicely.

50:20.977 --> 50:23.021
He came to tell me that the combination of sexes

50:23.188 --> 50:26.191
exaggerated the exposure of every human detail.

50:27.067 --> 50:29.653
As a result, any public exhibition is prohibited.

50:35.575 --> 50:38.453
The sweat on the bare back of your woman...

50:38.870 --> 50:40.769
...will make it even more desirable.

50:41.998 --> 50:44.206
They left you alone about your 'Kiss'.

50:45.794 --> 50:48.964
They can't cope with
a nude figure sculpted by a woman.

51:04.104 --> 51:06.917
You'll never leave Rose.
So why go on seeing each other?

51:07.607 --> 51:09.234
I'm not married to Rose...

51:10.026 --> 51:12.144
and I don't acknowledge her child.

51:13.697 --> 51:15.269
But you still won't leave her.

51:16.116 --> 51:19.355
She sits there quietly,
waiting for you to come home at night.

51:22.914 --> 51:24.183
Well?!

51:28.754 --> 51:29.808
I don't know.

51:32.507 --> 51:34.050
Come and see my 'Waltz'.

51:56.281 --> 51:58.159
It's beautiful... this imbalance!

52:02.287 --> 52:03.872
The gay abandon of your woman...

52:07.751 --> 52:09.044
As for him...

52:10.295 --> 52:12.399
He seems to breathe her in!

52:18.178 --> 52:20.555
If only I could make them swirl!

52:22.098 --> 52:23.975
Again and again.

52:25.268 --> 52:27.285
You might say I danced with them.

52:30.190 --> 52:31.730
So where are my dancers going?

52:33.610 --> 52:35.012
To love...

52:35.821 --> 52:37.058
...or to death?

52:40.826 --> 52:42.832
What are the three beats of the waltz?

52:44.621 --> 52:45.997
The embrace...

52:47.707 --> 52:49.292
dizziness...

52:53.421 --> 52:54.652
and passion.

52:58.635 --> 53:00.095
The approach...

53:02.347 --> 53:03.723
the torment...

53:05.350 --> 53:06.726
and death

53:16.444 --> 53:18.207
These two are magnificent.

53:21.950 --> 53:24.286
They seem to want to make time stand still.

53:26.371 --> 53:28.340
To swirl their swirl!

53:32.335 --> 53:33.558
Camille.

53:54.566 --> 53:56.401
You don't even know how to dance.

54:01.698 --> 54:03.700
Do you want me to hum a waltz?

54:03.867 --> 54:04.867
Yes.

54:06.703 --> 54:07.823
Oh yes.

54:24.804 --> 54:26.723
I want to breathe you in!

55:30.996 --> 55:33.164
Your train was on time?

55:33.498 --> 55:36.866
I told the driver that you were waiting.
He broke all speed records.

55:37.127 --> 55:40.218
Get your horny hands off me!
Mrs La Chatelaine might be watching.

55:40.444 --> 55:41.741
She's welcome to!

55:42.590 --> 55:43.675
Come here!

55:44.676 --> 55:46.177
It will do her good...

55:47.178 --> 55:48.513
...to watch us.

55:48.694 --> 55:50.818
You maintain you were timid when you were young?

55:50.843 --> 55:53.184
With success, all discretion has flown away.

55:53.601 --> 55:57.480
You were born to shut up,
but you'd say that more nicely.

55:58.690 --> 55:59.819
Pardon?

56:01.776 --> 56:03.278
Start again by articulating...

56:04.112 --> 56:05.389
...correctly.

56:06.114 --> 56:07.824
Your mouth...

56:08.533 --> 56:10.035
...shut! Your mouth shut.

56:10.201 --> 56:12.272
You were born to have your mouth closed.

56:13.038 --> 56:14.831
Mouths weren't made to chatter.

56:15.040 --> 56:17.764
Do you only get your voice back
to tell me that I chatter?

56:17.889 --> 56:19.522
No, it's to tell you, quickly...

56:20.003 --> 56:21.838
...that I'd like to see
our new bedroom!

56:24.924 --> 56:26.483
Come on then!

56:34.059 --> 56:35.561
<i>'Dearest Rose,</i>

56:36.061 --> 56:38.646
<i>always write to me in Tours
care of the post office.</i>

56:39.355 --> 56:40.774
<i>Don't worry...</i>

56:40.940 --> 56:43.568
<i>and make sure you take care of yourself.</i>

56:43.943 --> 56:45.487
<i>You know that I'll be thinking of you</i>

56:45.653 --> 56:47.739
<i>who is so obedient when you want to be...</i>

56:47.947 --> 56:50.033
<i>and when you want to please me.</i>

56:50.658 --> 56:54.079
<i>I'm working and will be kept busy for some time.</i>

56:54.579 --> 56:57.082
<i>I send you a warm kiss of our strong friendship.</i>

56:57.874 --> 56:59.375
<i>Yours truly...'</i>

57:02.253 --> 57:04.047
'Yours truly!'

57:07.175 --> 57:10.470
Mr Rodin...
Mr. Rodin, are you married?

57:11.096 --> 57:14.682
Mr Rodin is married to his Claudel.

57:18.895 --> 57:20.605
And he'll tell met...

57:22.273 --> 57:24.275
in the next letter?

57:32.283 --> 57:34.125
I shan't reply.

57:37.580 --> 57:38.914
Care of the post office!

57:56.141 --> 57:58.101
So, have you decided?

58:00.019 --> 58:01.312
Yes, definitely.

58:02.313 --> 58:03.648
It's decided.

58:06.609 --> 58:07.819
It's alright?

58:08.236 --> 58:10.563
How can she work carrying a baby?

58:11.739 --> 58:13.149
And I already have a child.

58:13.829 --> 58:15.891
It's hard, his mother cares only for me.

58:17.036 --> 58:18.860
And Camille can't take him either.

58:20.915 --> 58:22.792
And then, what will become of him?

58:23.334 --> 58:26.946
We'll have to hide him or place him
so his family knows nothing about it.

58:28.423 --> 58:30.785
- Take me to her.
- She'll say she's punished.

58:31.342 --> 58:33.973
She will say that she wants more.

58:35.715 --> 58:37.801
She knows we both agree.

58:39.350 --> 58:40.852
Nothing must happen to her.

58:42.478 --> 58:43.980
Nothing must happen to her.

58:47.358 --> 58:49.152
Mrs Courcelles will go with you.

59:32.820 --> 59:34.269
I've got you this time!

59:35.902 --> 59:38.409
If only you'd accept your body...

59:45.208 --> 59:48.336
Just because Zola got me this commission...

59:48.753 --> 59:50.910
It doesn't gives him the right to harass me.

59:54.759 --> 59:56.464
I'll finish you when I can.

59:58.638 --> 01:00:00.974
And then, I'll put you on a base...

01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:05.144
to look at you when you dominate us...

01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:08.605
and all the little people who get in your way.

01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:43.975
Can I tell you what I really think?

01:00:44.767 --> 01:00:46.902
You have reduced Balzac to a shapeless mass.

01:00:48.105 --> 01:00:51.121
Artistically, it is simply unsatisfactory.

01:00:52.079 --> 01:00:53.644
It's beyond description.

01:00:54.902 --> 01:00:58.012
Sorry to tell you so, but it is most displeasing!

01:01:00.168 --> 01:01:01.826
My aim is not to please.

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:03.494
Pardon?

01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:05.621
I said that my aim is not to please.

01:01:06.331 --> 01:01:08.371
All I want to do is find the truth.

01:01:09.334 --> 01:01:11.941
You think you've found the truth with this ogre?

01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:18.009
We wanted a Balzac who's young and slim.

01:01:18.426 --> 01:01:21.721
Go and admire the beautiful bust
by David d'Angers, adorning his tomb.

01:01:21.929 --> 01:01:23.139
Then you'll understand.

01:01:23.514 --> 01:01:25.933
There's no need to inflate his testicles.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.530
Balzac is a great men,
known for his magnificent works...

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:31.343
...not for his genitalia.

01:01:32.085 --> 01:01:33.639
He needs to have a neck.

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:36.313
Dress the next model...
and as quickly as possible...

01:01:36.361 --> 01:01:38.858
and make sure it's in accordance with our wishes.

01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:41.866
Don't forget you're already late, Rodin...

01:01:43.034 --> 01:01:45.038
...and you seem to have
lost your way.

01:01:50.522 --> 01:01:53.874
You should've said you wanted him
with a pen and inkwell...

01:01:54.587 --> 01:01:56.547
because I know how to do inkwells!

01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:02.530
You know the committee were here.

01:03:03.959 --> 01:03:05.741
I was told they were indignant.

01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:10.455
The want a Balzac with less stomach.

01:03:19.412 --> 01:03:20.576
That slash that you left...

01:03:21.436 --> 01:03:23.123
It looks like a caesarean.

01:03:24.844 --> 01:03:27.482
Do not forget that he still has
2,500 characters in his stomach!

01:03:30.326 --> 01:03:31.584
They have to come out!

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:36.272
It's weird anyway.

01:03:38.654 --> 01:03:41.054
Especially since we won't see her anymore,
once he's dressed.

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:29.116
You're not the first and you won't be the last!

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:30.607
And you, the housewife!

01:04:32.495 --> 01:04:34.455
The man's never satisfied!

01:04:34.622 --> 01:04:36.415
He's fucking you.
What comes next?

01:04:36.715 --> 01:04:38.185
You come here, searching out house...

01:04:38.209 --> 01:04:39.585
So here's where it happens!?

01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:42.380
Get the hell out of here!

01:04:42.547 --> 01:04:44.340
Get back to your kitchen!

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.127
Get out of here!

01:04:46.425 --> 01:04:48.135
You get nothing more!
Nothing more!

01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:49.637
Nothing at all!
Understand?

01:04:49.804 --> 01:04:50.972
Get out!

01:04:51.931 --> 01:04:53.474
Get out of here!

01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:55.643
- You believe he'll marry you?
- Get out of here!

01:04:55.851 --> 01:04:57.645
That he'll recognize your kids?

01:04:57.853 --> 01:04:59.940
Nothing! You'll get nothing!

01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:02.942
Get out of here, you bitch!

01:05:03.943 --> 01:05:06.821
Nothing...
Nothing at all!

01:05:16.289 --> 01:05:18.332
Still mumbling about those kids?

01:05:18.499 --> 01:05:19.333
No.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.140
You start with one, next thing it's four.

01:05:21.294 --> 01:05:23.062
So there are two to go.
Where are you at?

01:05:23.504 --> 01:05:24.984
Because I'm getting lost.

01:05:25.464 --> 01:05:27.883
Where do these children live?
Who cares for them?

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:30.011
You know, it's nothing new.
Your Claudel.

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:32.513
You can say whatever you like about it.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.787
But don't mention it to me.

01:05:33.945 --> 01:05:35.867
Keep your mouth shut, alright?!

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:42.328
You have in fact recognised them!

01:05:42.648 --> 01:05:44.317
Not like our son!

01:05:44.553 --> 01:05:46.514
- Your Auguste Beuret...
- He's yours!

01:05:46.611 --> 01:05:50.687
Who makes mediocre drawings
and sells them with my name on them!

01:05:53.534 --> 01:05:55.036
You talk about a son?!

01:05:55.858 --> 01:05:57.204
Gossip!

01:06:03.919 --> 01:06:05.820
And if what you're saying was true...

01:06:08.841 --> 01:06:11.812
...so then I would have
married the mother...

01:06:14.205 --> 01:06:16.804
and I would have given my name
to this gaggle of children.

01:06:17.433 --> 01:06:18.726
And believe it or not...

01:06:22.438 --> 01:06:23.632
...gladly!

01:06:30.738 --> 01:06:32.030
Gladly!

01:06:45.378 --> 01:06:46.835
I wanted to see you.

01:07:00.601 --> 01:07:02.929
Your Rose was here,
trying to pick a quarrel with me.

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:09.093
If your bitch ever comes again,
it's over between you and me.

01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:16.075
Paul will take up his new duties in New York.

01:07:16.702 --> 01:07:19.788
My beloved brother is moving away
from the sister you've dishonoured.

01:07:21.622 --> 01:07:22.790
Here...

01:07:23.416 --> 01:07:25.209
I had fun drawing you.

01:07:25.501 --> 01:07:27.294
I think you're looking your best.

01:07:28.421 --> 01:07:29.633
The bonding!

01:07:30.715 --> 01:07:32.290
It's true that it holds.

01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:37.938
You wanted to hang on to the tree...

01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:40.433
She won't shake off!

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:58.172
You're always finding ways
to blacken our relationship.

01:08:44.788 --> 01:08:46.586
I'm going to take a walk for a while.

01:08:48.251 --> 01:08:51.243
Don't forget your drawing.
It will appeal to Her Ladyship!

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:19.865
Mr Rodin, you're the first sculptor

01:09:20.032 --> 01:09:23.290
to have given importance to woman
and her sexuality.

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:27.372
With you, she's no longer just a tamed
and domesticated animal.

01:09:28.343 --> 01:09:31.399
Such a pretty face.
You're not cutting her head off?!

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:36.756
You still think that the face
is the only mirror of our feelings?

01:09:40.081 --> 01:09:41.081
Here.

01:09:43.848 --> 01:09:45.563
But if a torso is done well...

01:09:46.267 --> 01:09:48.143
when it's really successful...

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.063
...it holds all the life
in itself alone!

01:09:53.524 --> 01:09:54.775
Come with me.

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:56.985
You see?

01:09:58.445 --> 01:10:00.205
As far as I'm concerned, nothing is missing.

01:10:02.074 --> 01:10:03.633
She represents meditation.

01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:06.453
That's why she has no arms or legs.

01:10:06.662 --> 01:10:09.874
But when your work lacks
all the limbs and fingers..

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.540
One could say that it's not finished!

01:10:13.043 --> 01:10:14.633
Do we try to add to a tree?

01:10:16.797 --> 01:10:18.799
Are the great cathedrals finished?

01:10:19.884 --> 01:10:22.094
The greatest works of Michelangelo...

01:10:23.095 --> 01:10:25.139
...are those that are unfinished.

01:10:25.306 --> 01:10:26.540
See?

01:10:30.477 --> 01:10:32.479
Sorry, but I must leave you now.

01:10:54.585 --> 01:10:56.065
You don't come to the studio anymore.

01:10:56.921 --> 01:10:57.921
No.

01:10:58.923 --> 01:11:00.923
You work for yourself
as far as you're concerned...

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:03.971
and I don't blame you for that.

01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:08.515
Do you remember our contract?

01:11:11.018 --> 01:11:12.393
What's left of it?

01:11:13.938 --> 01:11:16.315
Presentation to your relatives, was one point.

01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:18.859
But I've done that.

01:11:19.652 --> 01:11:21.362
I've presented you to my relatives...

01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:23.736
and I'll continue to do that.

01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:25.197
As your pupil.

01:11:25.532 --> 01:11:26.822
No, not as my pupil.

01:11:27.236 --> 01:11:30.674
Nothing's ever written about me
without you getting a mention.

01:11:30.746 --> 01:11:33.874
What a leech you are for me!

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.962
And the promised trip to Italy?

01:11:38.679 --> 01:11:41.303
We haven't been to Italy,
but we've been to Touraine.

01:11:41.882 --> 01:11:44.301
And the promise of marriage after Italy?

01:11:44.468 --> 01:11:45.761
Remember that?

01:11:48.681 --> 01:11:50.265
You're a pain in the neck, Camille.

01:11:51.183 --> 01:11:52.233
You know why?

01:11:53.477 --> 01:11:57.564
You're not fully appreciated
and you can't accept that.

01:11:58.691 --> 01:12:00.567
While I've been lucky enough to make it.

01:12:02.778 --> 01:12:04.405
It's unfair, I grant you,

01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:07.405
But it degrades our relationship.

01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:17.668
I work really hard...

01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:24.299
I hardly ever exhibit...

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:27.803
I hardly sell anything.

01:12:31.015 --> 01:12:33.100
So what am I to conclude?

01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:36.890
That it's me who's responsible
for all your bad luck.

01:12:38.939 --> 01:12:40.190
Do you agree with that?

01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:48.115
It's always the same with you.

01:12:49.116 --> 01:12:50.836
The roller coaster goes up, it goes down...

01:12:50.951 --> 01:12:53.120
and the going down gets faster and faster.

01:12:53.829 --> 01:12:56.248
If it's going down faster on my side...

01:12:56.415 --> 01:12:58.415
...it'll be going up more
and more slowly on yours.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:04.204
- Did you come for a very naughty siesta?
- That's enough, Camille.

01:13:51.303 --> 01:13:52.971
Bring me the tub of plaster.

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:58.334
<i>They're all wanting to see me finish.</i>

01:15:59.097 --> 01:16:01.016
<i>But I just couldn't stop with my Balzac.</i>

01:16:01.433 --> 01:16:03.733
<i>Seven years of thinking, seven years of work.</i>

01:16:10.651 --> 01:16:11.827
So, Pompon...

01:16:13.153 --> 01:16:14.947
How do you like it?

01:16:16.983 --> 01:16:18.742
You're getting there!

01:16:20.244 --> 01:16:22.037
Go and buy me five dressing gowns.

01:16:22.746 --> 01:16:24.331
We'll set them up...

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.436
and then pick the best style for the job.

01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:36.093
It's humiliating...

01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:38.834
It's the bust that I made of you
that I mostly get asked for!

01:16:47.783 --> 01:16:48.913
Is that my fault?

01:16:49.295 --> 01:16:50.694
What am I to do?

01:16:51.358 --> 01:16:53.038
If it's not the bust, it's something else.

01:16:53.193 --> 01:16:54.592
You enjoy making trouble!

01:16:54.975 --> 01:16:56.613
And the child with you was trouble?

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:57.803
Did you want it?

01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:00.951
No...

01:17:01.285 --> 01:17:03.459
No more than you.
We agreed.

01:17:05.289 --> 01:17:06.842
I know the speech...

01:17:07.457 --> 01:17:10.248
'I live for my sculpture, you do too.
There is our life.'

01:17:10.319 --> 01:17:11.420
Yes, our life is there.

01:17:11.608 --> 01:17:13.982
Our children come out of clay
and become our children of marble.

01:17:14.006 --> 01:17:15.772
Absolutely!
Our life is there!

01:17:17.301 --> 01:17:19.094
I shared everything with you.

01:17:29.616 --> 01:17:32.178
We've worked as close friends, worked as one.

01:17:36.403 --> 01:17:38.155
We may be master craftsmen...

01:17:38.322 --> 01:17:40.319
but as human beings, we're wretched!

01:17:44.244 --> 01:17:47.039
Whatever I do, or intend to do,
it'll no longer be part of Rodin.

01:17:48.623 --> 01:17:50.280
You do what you think best, Camille.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.423
You know, your arrogance and your outbursts...

01:17:58.133 --> 01:17:59.634
They totally disarm me.

01:18:00.886 --> 01:18:02.930
You need to fall on your arse...
it'd do you good.

01:18:04.723 --> 01:18:06.641
Do you remember the future St Paul...

01:18:07.768 --> 01:18:09.328
when he was knocked down for no reason?

01:18:10.145 --> 01:18:12.147
He heard the voice of Christ...

01:18:12.439 --> 01:18:13.523
'Paul,

01:18:14.066 --> 01:18:15.667
why are you persecuting me?'

01:18:16.777 --> 01:18:18.570
Am I persecuting you now?

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.277
I'll not be swallowed
or siphoned off by you anymore.

01:18:29.456 --> 01:18:30.582
Never again.

01:18:31.958 --> 01:18:34.461
I love you as Camille,
but as Claudel, I hate you.

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:37.120
- I don't care!
- You frighten me.

01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:56.441
You don't need me anymore.

01:18:58.610 --> 01:18:59.610
Finally!

01:19:01.279 --> 01:19:02.989
It's finally said!

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.494
Miss Claudel, you say goodbye to Mr Rodin.

01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:09.394
Goodbye Mr Rodin!

01:19:44.239 --> 01:19:45.866
<i>When we were together...</i>

01:19:46.366 --> 01:19:48.368
<i>you have served me as a model three times.</i>

01:19:48.869 --> 01:19:50.620
<i>After our breakup...</i>

01:19:51.538 --> 01:19:53.972
<i>your face will return five times in my work.</i>

01:19:54.875 --> 01:19:56.960
<i>And I don't accuse you of persecuting me...</i>

01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:58.962
<i>Quite the contrary.</i>

01:20:21.193 --> 01:20:23.417
Don't release the chin.
Leave a contact.

01:20:59.189 --> 01:21:01.370
<i>I have to leave this monstrous Paris.</i>

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:05.654
<i>I'll set myself up in the country...</i>

01:21:07.113 --> 01:21:08.823
<i>forget all my troubles...</i>

01:21:09.741 --> 01:21:11.451
<i>...and work in the open air</i>

01:21:11.952 --> 01:21:13.745
<i>with my family of statues.</i>

01:21:19.251 --> 01:21:20.544
Auguste!

01:21:27.968 --> 01:21:30.136
Yesterday, at lunch, you still called me 'Dad'.

01:21:30.428 --> 01:21:32.055
You're to call me 'Sir' or 'Mr Rodin'...

01:21:32.222 --> 01:21:34.140
...like everyone else,
including your mother.

01:21:34.432 --> 01:21:35.752
She also calls you 'my old lady'.

01:21:35.844 --> 01:21:37.269
That's just between her and me.

01:21:37.477 --> 01:21:39.195
You just do what I tell you!

01:22:01.293 --> 01:22:02.794
There's a button missing.

01:22:03.878 --> 01:22:05.250
I know, it fell off.

01:22:05.469 --> 01:22:07.090
Buttons can be tricky.

01:22:07.465 --> 01:22:09.092
Is that supposed to be funny?

01:22:13.805 --> 01:22:15.515
Why are you so grumpy, sweetie?

01:22:16.808 --> 01:22:18.476
You ought to have help.

01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:20.687
I ask nothing of anyone.

01:22:20.895 --> 01:22:23.125
Was that just because you want to hire a maid?

01:22:23.649 --> 01:22:26.274
- So you can get her in the bedroom?
- We won't be hiring anyone!

01:22:26.469 --> 01:22:28.135
So, are you happy now?!

01:22:46.546 --> 01:22:48.214
Our set-up here...

01:22:50.717 --> 01:22:52.427
You're happy with it aren't you?

01:22:54.012 --> 01:22:56.156
You know I like living in the country.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:58.725
So, how about a smile?!

01:23:00.644 --> 01:23:03.086
Let me sew the button on.

01:23:03.563 --> 01:23:04.758
Let me do it.

01:23:16.826 --> 01:23:18.274
Where's needle?

01:23:18.438 --> 01:23:19.603
There.

01:23:49.476 --> 01:23:51.235
I'll call you 'Farewell'.

01:24:03.206 --> 01:24:04.274
I do like you...

01:24:08.712 --> 01:24:11.688
That's what happens when Camille
serves as your model.

01:24:19.222 --> 01:24:21.307
With your fingers up to your mouth...

01:24:24.936 --> 01:24:26.493
Do you want to tell me something?

01:24:34.099 --> 01:24:36.313
Or are your lips sealed for all time?

01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:43.365
Or do you want to stop me from stroking them?

01:24:49.753 --> 01:24:51.171
Good night, Camille...

01:25:00.847 --> 01:25:02.265
...wherever you are.

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.040
Sir...!

01:25:29.417 --> 01:25:31.044
I was at the Salon, and...

01:25:31.336 --> 01:25:33.922
...everyone was gathered
around your Balzac.

01:25:36.466 --> 01:25:39.135
Yes, to criticise it non-stop.

01:25:39.677 --> 01:25:41.346
But they do come back to it.

01:25:56.486 --> 01:25:58.071
What would you hear?

01:25:58.279 --> 01:25:59.989
'A polar bear on its hind legs'

01:26:03.284 --> 01:26:05.453
'A vile plaster nightmare'

01:26:08.081 --> 01:26:10.208
That's what you hear all over the place.

01:26:15.588 --> 01:26:17.924
I've become the Michelangelo of goitre.

01:26:19.592 --> 01:26:20.592
Sir...

01:26:20.979 --> 01:26:23.409
At the Salon I heard that you should wait...

01:26:23.674 --> 01:26:26.229
...at least ten years
before showing your works.

01:26:29.561 --> 01:26:32.338
The time may come
when I won't be understood at all.

01:26:35.817 --> 01:26:37.819
Then I'll be making progress.

01:26:43.324 --> 01:26:46.089
Your Balzac deserves
the most beautiful position in Paris.

01:26:56.713 --> 01:26:58.815
I was expecting a triumph...

01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:03.857
...but when President Felix Faure
stopped in front of 'The Kiss'...

01:27:04.012 --> 01:27:06.139
...and then completely ignore
my Balzac...

01:27:06.556 --> 01:27:08.683
I knew it was a disaster.

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:14.480
And now, the literati...

01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:19.721
...protesting against Mr Rodin's
'rough draft' as they call it!

01:27:20.278 --> 01:27:23.518
Mr Monet said you've never gone this far.

01:27:31.289 --> 01:27:33.729
But it's still a terrible defeat.

01:27:37.045 --> 01:27:39.112
And yet, I know I'm right.

01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:42.753
- Aren't I?
- Yes.

01:27:47.805 --> 01:27:49.719
Notre-Dame hasn't flown away

01:27:49.807 --> 01:27:52.143
despite all the dogs that have pissed on it.

01:27:54.479 --> 01:27:57.687
Have you read the review in 'Catholic World'?

01:27:59.817 --> 01:28:01.027
Yes, I read it.

01:28:01.344 --> 01:28:03.404
Actually, I was quite happy about it.

01:28:03.922 --> 01:28:05.615
'Look at Zola, look at Rodin...'

01:28:05.823 --> 01:28:08.164
'Filthy literature, filthy sculpture.'

01:28:09.202 --> 01:28:10.555
And it's not over yet.

01:28:10.695 --> 01:28:13.665
'When we know that neither of them
are of French origin...'

01:28:13.831 --> 01:28:17.085
You realize they're treating you like a wog?

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:20.922
They're wrong.

01:28:21.523 --> 01:28:24.133
Rodin is a Christian name
that dates back to the Middle Ages.

01:28:24.342 --> 01:28:25.927
They're totally wrong.

01:28:26.094 --> 01:28:28.763
And even if you were Prussian!

01:28:30.723 --> 01:28:33.859
You're totally inflexible
about your creativity...

01:28:34.727 --> 01:28:37.772
but outside of your work,
when it comes to fighting...

01:28:37.939 --> 01:28:39.941
you lose your daring!

01:28:40.942 --> 01:28:43.027
It's easy for you, Mirbeau...

01:28:43.945 --> 01:28:46.746
...you're a crusading writer
that people dread.

01:28:47.115 --> 01:28:50.326
Yes, because there are battles to be won.

01:28:58.751 --> 01:29:01.963
You know that you and Monet are like gods to me.

01:29:02.839 --> 01:29:07.262
It's true that your Balzac has
most of the public against it...

01:29:07.635 --> 01:29:10.513
...together with
the conformist critics...

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.348
...and the accursed press.
So what?

01:29:12.974 --> 01:29:14.559
You should rejoice.

01:29:14.976 --> 01:29:19.105
It's the latest scandal of the century,
after Manet's and Courbet's.

01:29:19.981 --> 01:29:21.733
Don't you realise...?

01:29:21.899 --> 01:29:24.277
Your Balzac is a masterpiece!

01:29:24.777 --> 01:29:27.572
Next to your colossus, the other sculptures

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:29.652
look like hairdresser dolls!

01:29:30.283 --> 01:29:32.965
And your friends have organised a subscription...

01:29:33.286 --> 01:29:36.372
...for the statue to be erected
on a square in Paris.

01:29:36.998 --> 01:29:39.917
Bourdelle, Maillol, Toulouse-Lautrec,

01:29:40.084 --> 01:29:42.920
Gauguin, Renoir, Monet, Cezanne, Sisley...

01:29:43.087 --> 01:29:45.214
and even Debussy, Mallarme...

01:29:45.423 --> 01:29:47.696
Valery, Gide...
and others I've forgotten.

01:29:48.217 --> 01:29:50.298
You're backed by the cream of the crop.

01:29:52.305 --> 01:29:54.235
All this terrifies me, Mirbeau.

01:29:58.414 --> 01:29:59.854
Really terrifies me.

01:30:04.233 --> 01:30:05.233
Rodin...

01:30:06.611 --> 01:30:08.672
...stop disappointing your friends.

01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:20.422
I'll remove my statue and install it at home.

01:30:20.531 --> 01:30:22.335
The only place I can trust.

01:30:26.242 --> 01:30:29.367
Since my Balzac, I've become another man.

01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:34.265
He'll be my beloved child forever.

01:31:01.582 --> 01:31:02.937
Bourdelle was right.

01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:06.609
I did well to take you as a pupil.

01:31:09.008 --> 01:31:11.953
I didn't know that I'd be
learning something else here.

01:31:13.094 --> 01:31:15.734
I'd never shivered like that before.

01:31:19.308 --> 01:31:21.586
Today, I want to start your bust.

01:31:22.478 --> 01:31:23.664
No, Sir...

01:31:24.313 --> 01:31:26.524
I can't be nude in public.

01:31:27.850 --> 01:31:29.330
Everyone just walks into this studio.

01:31:29.402 --> 01:31:33.030
I'm not a model 'we draw
by day and cuddle by night'...

01:31:33.197 --> 01:31:34.623
like Zola wrote.

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.330
I'd like you to love me a little bit.

01:31:48.337 --> 01:31:51.048
I've been a slave to feelings
for such a long time...

01:31:51.592 --> 01:31:53.397
Today I want my freedom.

01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:02.143
Look...

01:32:03.936 --> 01:32:05.813
Do you see her balance and how she stays up?

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.024
If I were a great sculptor...

01:32:08.524 --> 01:32:12.737
...she would fly even further
and not even touch the ground.

01:32:13.654 --> 01:32:16.282
Bourdelle said that you embodied sculpture.

01:32:16.451 --> 01:32:19.342
- Really? Bourdelle said that?
- Yes!

01:32:26.857 --> 01:32:29.756
Go and fix yourself.
They'll be here soon.

01:32:30.006 --> 01:32:32.396
- You'll come and see me?
- Yes, Thursday.

01:32:34.467 --> 01:32:35.732
I'll come Thursday.

01:32:51.901 --> 01:32:53.611
Carry on, Hilda.

01:33:13.381 --> 01:33:15.577
I'm surprised you steal my model.

01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:24.100
Mary, you've been Whistler's pupil, haven't you?

01:33:24.642 --> 01:33:26.546
[English accent]
Yes, the same as my brother.

01:33:26.936 --> 01:33:30.694
I'm telling you this because London
want me for a monument to his memory

01:33:32.316 --> 01:33:35.264
and I have the idea of a muse for this statue.

01:33:36.028 --> 01:33:37.947
Would you like to be that muse?

01:33:38.656 --> 01:33:40.199
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:33:48.916 --> 01:33:51.187
Are you still coming to see me tonight?

01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:54.890
Why do you think I came?

01:33:55.214 --> 01:33:57.999
Last night, I thought you were on top of me...

01:33:58.426 --> 01:34:00.179
and that this thing was in me...

01:34:00.636 --> 01:34:03.264
and that it wasn't my finger...

01:34:03.681 --> 01:34:05.671
Then I had so much pleasure...

01:34:06.434 --> 01:34:09.421
The shivers went right down my legs.

01:34:12.690 --> 01:34:14.483
Kiss Me.

01:34:31.167 --> 01:34:33.874
Hilda, I know you know the Carpeaux group.

01:34:35.379 --> 01:34:37.515
Do you know it, Mary?

01:34:38.883 --> 01:34:43.093
Yes, it's this pretty dance scene
on the side of the Opera House.

01:34:44.597 --> 01:34:47.308
A sort of farandole of women.

01:34:47.475 --> 01:34:48.570
Of naked women.

01:34:48.734 --> 01:34:51.859
Yes, of naked women dancing around a young man.

01:35:03.797 --> 01:35:06.890
And if you accept that I am
this young man a little older...

01:35:07.912 --> 01:35:10.015
...we could pay homage to Carpeaux.

01:36:06.887 --> 01:36:09.726
It took me three years
to get out of that affair, Blot.

01:36:14.979 --> 01:36:16.689
I had no taste for anything...

01:36:17.064 --> 01:36:18.851
as if I had no brains anymore.

01:36:21.633 --> 01:36:24.242
Today, I can finally sleep and work.

01:36:26.953 --> 01:36:29.695
Tell me what else I can do for her,
and then leave me.

01:36:30.711 --> 01:36:33.265
Camille has convinced herself
that you were plagiarizing her.

01:36:33.765 --> 01:36:35.000
That's ridiculous.

01:36:36.208 --> 01:36:37.710
I don't see her anymore.

01:36:38.711 --> 01:36:40.351
Neither her nor her work.

01:36:44.842 --> 01:36:47.976
She just wrote to me
that she found my Balzac very beautiful.

01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:51.932
That's the only word I've had from her.

01:36:52.375 --> 01:36:55.936
She blames you for everything,
and she's full of hatred.

01:36:56.312 --> 01:36:58.022
'Rodin is outside my windows...'

01:36:58.230 --> 01:37:00.898
'He stands on a chair
and watches everything I do.'

01:37:06.155 --> 01:37:07.155
Like this?

01:37:09.325 --> 01:37:11.117
Mr Rodin... please!

01:37:12.453 --> 01:37:13.954
Come down.

01:37:14.955 --> 01:37:16.734
Well, let me spy on her...

01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:20.836
...since that's what she wants!

01:37:30.179 --> 01:37:32.264
I have no authority over her anymore.

01:37:38.479 --> 01:37:40.750
Pay Pompon the account she owes him.

01:37:43.067 --> 01:37:45.578
I'll continue to be her anonymous benefactor...

01:37:46.779 --> 01:37:48.781
...to pay her expenses.

01:37:53.577 --> 01:37:55.412
I'll write to the department...

01:37:56.179 --> 01:37:58.187
to give her the marble she needs...

01:38:00.501 --> 01:38:02.711
and I won't terminate her lease.

01:38:07.091 --> 01:38:08.509
And at the Salon...

01:38:09.593 --> 01:38:11.193
so that she can send one of her works...

01:38:12.429 --> 01:38:14.098
I'll pull out one of mine.

01:38:15.933 --> 01:38:19.281
And if a journalist wants to
interest himself in my work...

01:38:22.648 --> 01:38:24.476
I'd rather he switch it to hers.

01:38:26.652 --> 01:38:29.679
It was mainly to tell you
she's not going well at all.

01:38:31.883 --> 01:38:34.784
Her head is filled with
her obsessions about Rodin.

01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:43.308
She doesn't need me any more.

01:38:46.547 --> 01:38:48.573
That's what she always wanted, wasn't it?

01:38:52.344 --> 01:38:53.909
Leave me now...
and Blot...

01:38:54.597 --> 01:38:55.917
Don't come back.

01:39:19.413 --> 01:39:20.629
You know, Rilke...

01:39:22.541 --> 01:39:23.847
this is my last visit.

01:39:24.209 --> 01:39:25.210
Giants.

01:39:26.045 --> 01:39:29.673
Your Balzac will end up needing
flying buttresses like a cathedral.

01:39:35.447 --> 01:39:38.167
Look at the procession of the damned
who are thrown into the furnace.

01:39:39.058 --> 01:39:40.768
And the angels up there...

01:39:40.934 --> 01:39:42.556
doing crowd-control.

01:39:44.813 --> 01:39:46.148
And that one...

01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:48.620
who's poking his tongue out at an angel...

01:39:49.151 --> 01:39:51.445
and the other who's abusing it.

01:39:52.071 --> 01:39:53.250
Quite marvellous!

01:39:54.573 --> 01:39:57.125
Everyone is waiting to be thrown in there.

01:39:57.660 --> 01:39:59.870
But they're not jostling, and stumbling

01:40:00.037 --> 01:40:02.430
like the figures on your gate.

01:40:07.169 --> 01:40:08.680
And there's Joseph.

01:40:09.755 --> 01:40:11.055
On the pedestal.

01:40:12.091 --> 01:40:13.884
Madame Putiphar.

01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:18.764
Look how interested she is in hearing...

01:40:18.972 --> 01:40:20.571
...the demon of temptation.

01:40:23.063 --> 01:40:24.219
What about that dragon!

01:40:24.603 --> 01:40:26.355
Look at the way it moves!

01:40:26.855 --> 01:40:28.357
Those shapes.

01:40:32.069 --> 01:40:34.891
When Joseph refused her advances...

01:40:35.406 --> 01:40:37.164
...she had him thrown in prison.

01:40:39.076 --> 01:40:41.914
And Joseph didn't give in...
did he?

01:40:43.997 --> 01:40:44.998
Rilke...

01:40:45.165 --> 01:40:48.360
Can you comprehend all that has
come out of that solitude of stone?

01:40:50.295 --> 01:40:52.750
And it took hundreds and hundreds of years.

01:40:53.132 --> 01:40:55.509
Yet some consider it the work of barbarians.

01:40:55.926 --> 01:40:57.261
Not a Rousseau...

01:40:57.428 --> 01:40:59.304
not a Chateaubriand.

01:40:59.513 --> 01:41:01.140
No one to defend them!

01:41:01.724 --> 01:41:02.724
Never.

01:41:03.308 --> 01:41:05.547
Is this where you learned about sculpture?

01:41:05.644 --> 01:41:06.478
Yes.

01:41:06.645 --> 01:41:08.461
As well as from looking at trees...

01:41:10.023 --> 01:41:12.414
Observing the structure of clouds...

01:41:13.444 --> 01:41:15.992
The beautiful clouds that form in the sky.

01:41:55.006 --> 01:41:57.561
Peasant girls have firm flesh.

01:41:58.280 --> 01:41:59.865
That's what you used to say...

01:42:00.574 --> 01:42:02.284
...when I was posing for you.

01:42:03.994 --> 01:42:05.871
I was too slow at first!

01:42:06.705 --> 01:42:08.506
Yes, I was too slow at first.

01:42:09.291 --> 01:42:12.211
I wanted to do the right thing.
I didn't want to ruin you.

01:42:16.089 --> 01:42:17.800
I didn't want to ruin you.

01:42:18.383 --> 01:42:20.177
You were awfully pretty.

01:42:20.385 --> 01:42:22.054
- You were so sexy!
- Because of you!

01:42:22.221 --> 01:42:23.722
So sexy!

01:42:25.516 --> 01:42:27.017
A sexpot!

01:42:28.977 --> 01:42:31.021
- Do you know what Dionysos said?
- What?

01:42:31.230 --> 01:42:35.025
He said girls may be beautiful
but a grown woman is more so.

01:42:35.234 --> 01:42:36.318
Really?

01:42:46.203 --> 01:42:47.746
You want me to show you?

01:42:47.913 --> 01:42:49.498
- You want me to show you?
- Yes.

01:42:49.665 --> 01:42:52.584
- How sexy a woman can be?
- Yes!

01:43:06.056 --> 01:43:08.314
Last time we did a bust.

01:43:10.185 --> 01:43:12.314
I need to draw your body, Hanako.

01:43:12.855 --> 01:43:15.983
I need to see your muscularity.
Understand?

01:43:22.573 --> 01:43:24.575
You know I can't understand you.

01:43:26.577 --> 01:43:28.009
Look...

01:43:30.914 --> 01:43:31.914
Look.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.793
Come with me.

01:43:36.587 --> 01:43:37.713
Come.

01:43:38.922 --> 01:43:40.299
You see?

01:43:41.216 --> 01:43:43.947
She's hidden...
can't be seen.

01:43:47.931 --> 01:43:50.017
Come here.

01:43:50.225 --> 01:43:52.228
I need you to undress...

01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.501
This has to come off.

01:43:55.314 --> 01:43:56.595
Master...

01:43:57.316 --> 01:43:58.556
I'm sorry...

01:44:01.111 --> 01:44:03.196
I... I cannot...

01:44:03.746 --> 01:44:06.332
What's up with the Chink?
Won't she pose nude?

01:44:06.491 --> 01:44:07.284
No she won't.

01:44:07.443 --> 01:44:10.070
Those rice-eater manners
don't cut with us...

01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:11.814
Nude means naked!

01:44:12.039 --> 01:44:14.249
Naked... starkers!
Understand?

01:44:14.416 --> 01:44:16.126
Rose, get out!

01:44:16.627 --> 01:44:18.045
Naked!

01:44:21.131 --> 01:44:22.966
Where did she go?

01:44:37.272 --> 01:44:38.556
Hanako.

01:44:45.864 --> 01:44:47.491
Raise your leg a little bit.

01:44:48.575 --> 01:44:49.576
More.

01:44:50.994 --> 01:44:52.287
More.

01:44:54.957 --> 01:44:56.291
Little bit more.

01:44:57.793 --> 01:44:58.884
Your arm...

01:45:01.150 --> 01:45:02.587
There... lower.

01:45:03.090 --> 01:45:04.091
Lower.

01:45:04.508 --> 01:45:05.676
More.

01:45:06.259 --> 01:45:07.469
That's it!

01:45:19.314 --> 01:45:21.298
Hanako... your head...

01:45:22.317 --> 01:45:23.527
More.

01:45:36.039 --> 01:45:37.541
Could be a fox terrier.

01:45:40.212 --> 01:45:42.462
You have the twitching muscles
of a fox-terrier.

01:46:09.031 --> 01:46:10.157
Rose,

01:46:10.657 --> 01:46:12.951
Give that doll to Rilke's daughter.

01:46:15.954 --> 01:46:17.400
I'm not giving Yoyote away!

01:46:19.082 --> 01:46:22.169
I didn't bring that doll back for you
so you'd be playing with it all day.

01:46:22.961 --> 01:46:24.671
It's ridiculous at your age.

01:46:25.589 --> 01:46:26.965
Ridiculous!

01:46:31.361 --> 01:46:33.298
How long have you had it now?

01:46:34.181 --> 01:46:35.822
How long have you been hanging on to it?

01:46:36.391 --> 01:46:37.408
Five years.

01:46:39.061 --> 01:46:41.908
I would very much like
that you give it to Rilke's daughter.

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:47.819
- You test a person's patience.
- Do as I say... give it to her!

01:46:47.986 --> 01:46:50.906
You do what I tell you...
You send it or I smash it!

01:47:26.817 --> 01:47:30.028
All I think of is my work.
It's making me a bastard.

01:47:32.614 --> 01:47:34.314
I've been too hard on you.

01:47:51.633 --> 01:47:52.986
You know, Rose...

01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:00.962
God made me a very great gift
by putting you near me.

01:48:02.394 --> 01:48:03.979
Would you take those words...

01:48:07.065 --> 01:48:09.401
and be kind enough to hold them
close to your heart.

01:50:24.494 --> 01:50:25.620
It's freezing!

01:50:26.121 --> 01:50:27.722
Yes it's freezing.
Hi, Rodin.

01:50:28.206 --> 01:50:29.207
Hi.

01:50:37.507 --> 01:50:39.301
- Want me to help you?
- Yes.

01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:50.316
Let's try some new things...

01:50:50.729 --> 01:50:52.731
Poses you haven't made before.

01:51:00.113 --> 01:51:02.240
<i>For a long time, I indicated poses.</i>

01:51:03.241 --> 01:51:05.413
<i>Today I missed a mistake.</i>

01:51:10.457 --> 01:51:12.250
<i>If I lower my eyes for a moment...</i>

01:51:12.542 --> 01:51:14.169
<i>...the current is cut off.</i>

01:51:15.170 --> 01:51:17.905
<i>My hands must feel what my eyes see...</i>

01:51:18.882 --> 01:51:20.467
<i>...otherwise it's wrecked.</i>

01:52:46.636 --> 01:52:49.139
You know that Matisse
came to show me his drawings?

01:52:51.433 --> 01:52:53.999
- He's a nice guy.
- Yes, he's nice.

01:52:57.063 --> 01:52:59.941
I told him that I found them
a little too polished for my taste.

01:53:00.733 --> 01:53:02.152
After that...

01:53:03.570 --> 01:53:06.072
...he was told that he should
be wary of the old lion.

01:53:07.365 --> 01:53:09.210
It's true... you have big teeth!

01:53:11.161 --> 01:53:13.371
'If you get too close,
he'll devour you.'

01:53:13.788 --> 01:53:15.582
Better just to draw us!

01:53:55.497 --> 01:53:56.522
That's it.

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:25.235
It's evenings which give the best results.

01:54:25.527 --> 01:54:27.237
No, Steichen. The nights.

01:54:27.570 --> 01:54:29.239
Moonlit nights!

01:54:32.158 --> 01:54:34.358
The moonlight will please him.

01:54:37.372 --> 01:54:38.873
In this case, it will need

01:54:39.457 --> 01:54:41.444
a thirty-minute exposure at 2am.

01:54:42.335 --> 01:54:43.655
That's unheard of!

01:54:45.255 --> 01:54:47.966
So long as he's not locked up in a museum.

01:54:49.676 --> 01:54:51.678
Because he's going to need air air.

01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:55.265
Show him your camera.

01:54:56.099 --> 01:54:57.859
Let him understand that he'll be travelling.

01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:07.277
Get closer...

01:55:09.988 --> 01:55:11.614
Did you see...

01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:13.908
...his little quiver of joy?

01:55:14.305 --> 01:55:20.286
