02:15.160 --> 02:16.680
<i>Sartaj, where are you?</i>

02:19.720 --> 02:21.880
<i>Get out of there. Don't fuck around.</i>

02:23.880 --> 02:27.480
<i>Get ahold of yourself,</i>
<i>or you'll end up in the small arms unit.</i>

02:28.400 --> 02:30.680
<i>You can sit and clean revolvers</i>
<i>for a month.</i>

03:36.120 --> 03:38.120
Sir, this is the same guy. Malcolm Mourad.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.160
He was with the GIA in Algeria.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.000
Then he disappeared for 12 years.
He was seen in Peshawar five years ago.

03:50.080 --> 03:53.080
Germany detained him for two years
for making dirty bombs.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.880
First Gaitonde,
and now Malcolm Mourad is in India.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.560
Whose number do you need, sir?

05:09.840 --> 05:10.680
Zoya Mirza's.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.400
-Did you find anything?
-No.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.960
Check the calls she made this afternoon.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.720
She must have called Parulkar
at around 2:30 p.m.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.560
Is this the one?

05:33.080 --> 05:33.920
No.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.800
Show me Parulkar's call records.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.640
Parulkar's?

05:43.840 --> 05:45.120
Yes, Parulkar's.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.400
<i>The file that Jojo had is now with me.</i>

06:11.240 --> 06:14.120
<i>It contains everything,</i>
<i>from Gaitonde to Pakistan.</i>

06:16.000 --> 06:17.280
Tell me when you want to meet.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.400
What do you want, Inspector?

07:26.240 --> 07:28.320
How do you know Gaitonde?

07:34.920 --> 07:37.080
He produced my first movie.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.640
Did he pay for your surgery?

07:40.880 --> 07:43.240
Only my acting fees.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.720
When was the last time you saw him?

08:02.520 --> 08:04.320
You must have made copies of this file.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.160
Now you can blackmail me forever. Blackmailers don't talk face-to-face.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.920
When did you last see him?

08:17.520 --> 08:19.360
A week before he died.

08:19.920 --> 08:20.920
Where?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.720
I don't know. It was dark.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.320
He took me somewhere.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.920
What did you talk about?

08:27.000 --> 08:30.080
He asked if I had betrayed him too.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.560
Betrayed how?

08:32.600 --> 08:33.679
I don't know.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.880
He was acting strange.

08:38.159 --> 08:41.280
He seemed depressed,
or maybe he was scared.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.960
Who was Gaitonde scared of?

08:44.600 --> 08:47.760
-I don't know.
-Did he talk about an attack on Mumbai?

08:47.840 --> 08:49.840
Or about a consignment
that was on the way?

08:51.160 --> 08:53.000
He told me to leave Mumbai.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.640
-Why?
-I just told you!

08:55.280 --> 08:59.000
He was saying weird... strange things.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.040
"Everyone will die except Trivedi."

09:02.840 --> 09:04.120
Do you know Trivedi?

09:21.920 --> 09:24.240
Have some news for you.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.960
<i>Trivedi. Celibate since birth.</i>

09:59.120 --> 10:01.800
<i>A bureaucrat who drank</i>
<i>five glasses of milk every day.</i>

10:02.800 --> 10:05.280
<i>He dreamed of changing</i>
<i>the country's future.</i>

10:05.360 --> 10:06.920
<i>Nobody knew much about him.</i>

10:07.440 --> 10:09.840
<i>He was my third father's follower.</i>

10:10.600 --> 10:12.000
<i>He would touch his feet</i>
<i>and seek blessings.</i>

10:12.840 --> 10:13.920
Bless me, Guruji.

10:15.200 --> 10:19.760
It's time you stopped
with all this deference.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.680
What can be done? Old habits die hard.

10:24.680 --> 10:25.720
What time of year is it?

10:26.840 --> 10:29.760
-It's the monsoon season...
-No, no, the date.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.480
August 10th, 1992.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.400
The wheel is turning.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.520
Only 25 years are left.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.800
The times will change.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.080
Twenty five years?

10:41.840 --> 10:44.680
-But, Guruji, I thought...
-Mr. Trivedi...

10:45.240 --> 10:49.880
for the universe, 25 years go by
in the blink of an eye.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.120
That's it.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.520
Revolution will come
when we have our people

10:55.600 --> 10:57.920
-on foreign lands too.
-Yes, Guruji.

10:58.280 --> 10:59.760
Did you find anyone? That's why I am here.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.840
I have someone in mind.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.240
Sir, this is our staff.
We've reserved the hotel just for you.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.440
This way, sir. Eat.

12:17.880 --> 12:18.960
Are you fasting?

12:19.480 --> 12:20.960
-No.
-Then eat.

12:27.760 --> 12:31.600
Why are you picking at your food?
Come on, eat.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.240
Eat.

12:40.480 --> 12:44.560
This is kharvas. Try it.
It's made from a cow's colostrum.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.400
You can taste the sacrifice in it.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.680
-Have some.
-Okay.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.800
Try some for me.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.000
I won't eat either.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.640
Here is your bow and arrow!

13:17.400 --> 13:19.280
You're not on the battlefield.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.840
-Hey, Bhonsle.
-Mr. Ganesh.

13:22.520 --> 13:26.320
Welcome. Please take a seat, ma'am.
Hey, get some chairs.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.440
Please come.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.560
Mr. Trivedi?

13:29.880 --> 13:33.120
This is Ganesh... Ganesh Gaitonde.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.800
-Ganesh!
-Mr. Ganesh.

13:36.880 --> 13:37.840
Ganesh...

13:38.320 --> 13:41.760
the way you radiate...

13:43.120 --> 13:45.480
power and strength...

13:46.840 --> 13:51.200
it feels like Lord Shiva has been reborn. Only once in a lifetime
does God manifest himself like this.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.120
I'm sure he gives you a heads-up
before coming.

14:00.720 --> 14:04.000
Sir, he has a strong connection with God.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.240
He's a famed scholar.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.360
-No.
-A man of extraordinary devotion.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.160
He performs holy rituals.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.560
Very impressive.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.560
-No...
-Listen, Bhonsle.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.600
-I have a lot to do in very little time.
-Yes.

14:18.680 --> 14:22.480
Let's skip the small talk.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.680
That's not up to you.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.880
It's all predestined.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.040
What do you want?

14:29.440 --> 14:30.720
Your support.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.800
To help our people grow.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.440
To spread our wings.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.720
-"Our," as in...?
-Well, our community.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.800
We are just servants.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.000
Bhonsle, I don't get him.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.880
-You talk in riddles.
-Yes.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.280
I prefer to keep things simple.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.200
Okay.

15:00.320 --> 15:01.840
Let's get straight to business.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.400
Look, it's a big job.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.120
And it's a huge responsibility.

15:09.280 --> 15:12.400
It's time to go overseas.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.920
India is going to turn into a battlefield.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.480
And we need a general.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.680
-Two things, Mr. Trivedi.
-Yes?

15:25.240 --> 15:27.880
First, Bombay gave me all I have.
I'll never leave it.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.440
And second, imagine two ducks
in front of a duck,

15:33.520 --> 15:36.640
and two ducks behind a duck.
Tell me, how many are there in total?

15:36.720 --> 15:37.920
Well, how many?

15:38.480 --> 15:41.120
It's simple. There are three ducks.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.480
If you talk in riddles,

15:44.840 --> 15:46.840
I'll shove all three ducks up your ass.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.240
You'll be eating and shitting
from the same hole.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.680
-I'll be off now.
-Ganesh...

15:51.920 --> 15:53.840
-Such a waste of time.
-Ganesh...

15:53.920 --> 15:56.520
-He's an important man.
-So am I.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.440
-Sir... Let her eat.
-Come on!

15:58.520 --> 16:01.320
-Let her eat the jalebis.
-Just pack them up.

16:01.400 --> 16:05.200
-Hail Lord Rama!
-Hail Lord Rama!

16:07.240 --> 16:08.600
You ate so many jalebis.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.200
-What?
-How many did you eat?

16:12.240 --> 16:13.160
Tell me.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.000
Twelve.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.560
Gopalmath's mosquitoes
are going to get diabetes tonight.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.600
Tell me something.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.680
If you're so fond of sweets...

16:31.640 --> 16:33.720
why didn't you eat the kharvas?

16:37.120 --> 16:38.280
Well...

16:40.280 --> 16:41.800
when I was young,

16:41.880 --> 16:44.320
<i>we would get kharvas</i>
<i>for the Lord Ganesha festival.</i>

16:44.800 --> 16:47.000
<i>I could smell it the moment</i>
<i>it entered the house.</i>

16:47.080 --> 16:49.040
<i>We were not allowed to eat it.</i>

16:49.840 --> 16:51.720
<i>It was only for God.</i>

16:52.280 --> 16:57.600
But I would devour it in my dreams.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.520
I'd imagine its heavenly taste.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.160
It was perfect.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.480
That's why I didn't eat it.

17:09.960 --> 17:14.839
I thought it wouldn't live up

17:15.599 --> 17:19.480
to the kharvas of my dreams.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.560
<i>Trivedi asked me to leave India...</i>

17:23.599 --> 17:25.599
<i>but my heart was in Bombay.</i>

17:27.359 --> 17:29.200
<i>Yet my Bombay was about to change.</i>

17:29.840 --> 17:31.520
<i>"In 25 years, everything will change."</i>

17:31.600 --> 17:33.720
<i>That is what my third father said.</i>

17:33.800 --> 17:38.040
<i>And with the fall of the Babri Mosque,</i>
<i>the 25-year-cycle began.</i>

17:38.920 --> 17:40.960
<i>Lord Rama was born there.</i>

17:41.040 --> 17:43.040
<i>That's what the priests said.</i>

17:43.320 --> 17:46.800
<i>Babur built a mosque on it 465 years ago.</i>

17:47.280 --> 17:49.840
<i>The plan was to demolish it</i>
<i>and build a temple instead.</i>

17:50.680 --> 17:55.760
<i>The Hindu-Muslim riots began. To avenge</i>
<i>the demolition, Isa bombed Bombay.</i>

17:56.160 --> 17:59.000
<i>The whole city turned into a graveyard.</i>

17:59.960 --> 18:02.200
<i>The people of Gopalmath needed me.</i>

18:23.640 --> 18:26.760
I don't need your money!
Go buy your men some balls instead.

18:26.840 --> 18:30.080
Tell them to kill ten Muslims
for every Hindu killed!

18:32.560 --> 18:34.760
Look! My son's legs are broken!

18:34.840 --> 18:35.680
Look! Look!

18:41.920 --> 18:44.680
He lost his legs in the bomb blast.
What can I do?

18:44.760 --> 18:48.080
I'm not God.
I can't give him his limbs back.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.480
People are coming
from all over Bombay to meet you...

18:53.520 --> 18:55.440
and you're sitting here in Gopalmath.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.120
-There must be a reason...
-What reason?

18:59.920 --> 19:01.560
They are all shit-scared. Cowards.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.640
Only the weak need God.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.600
Being weak is not a crime.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.600
Religion is the biggest business
in the world.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.720
They use the fear of God
to rule over people.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.400
The poor don't fear God.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.680
They love him.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.440
He gives them strength.

19:26.760 --> 19:32.000
This business that you speak of,
it's only for the rich and powerful.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.440
All the poor do is struggle.

19:35.760 --> 19:39.920
They wash people's cars,
houses and toilets.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.960
They're only welcomed at the temples.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.840
They play loud music and dance
during the festivals,

19:48.360 --> 19:49.520
not to please God...

19:50.400 --> 19:53.200
but to enjoy their one day of freedom.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.800
They're not allowed inside dance clubs,

19:57.480 --> 20:00.680
so they make the city their dance floor.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.000
They feel like they belong here,

20:05.560 --> 20:08.000
like they're equals.

20:09.120 --> 20:13.600
They feel like they're not fuckwits,
they're humans.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.080
Where's Gaitonde?

21:01.680 --> 21:04.520
Wait, wait.
Which police station are you from?

21:04.600 --> 21:06.000
-Hey!
-Wait.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.520
Where's Gaitonde?

21:09.080 --> 21:10.000
Call him.

21:10.920 --> 21:11.880
He's not here.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.160
Cover him.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.240
Motherfucker!

23:08.080 --> 23:09.040
Bunty!

23:09.120 --> 23:10.200
Bunty!

23:15.320 --> 23:17.160
They weren't cops. Who were they?

23:17.240 --> 23:21.680
That motherfucker Isa's men, boss!

23:21.920 --> 23:22.760
Okay.

23:22.840 --> 23:25.480
Both of my legs are gone, boss.

23:30.320 --> 23:31.440
Subhadra.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.120
Subhadra.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.880
What did Lord Rama do...

23:49.240 --> 23:51.120
when Ravana abducted Sita?

23:53.160 --> 23:55.000
-He sent Hanuman.
-Yes.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.120
He sent Hanuman, right?

23:57.480 --> 23:59.680
And then Hanuman set Lanka on fire.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.000
<i>Then what did Lord Rama do?</i>

24:04.760 --> 24:06.000
<i>He killed Ravana.</i>

24:08.240 --> 24:09.200
<i>Yes.</i>

24:14.040 --> 24:17.520
<i>When Isa killed Subhadra,</i>
<i>he awoke the Hindu in me.</i>

24:18.360 --> 24:21.120
<i>Isa left for Dubai after the bombings.</i>

24:21.440 --> 24:23.800
<i>His business was done here,</i>

24:24.280 --> 24:26.760
<i>but he took his revenge before he left.</i>

24:27.160 --> 24:28.920
<i>It was my turn now.</i>

24:29.840 --> 24:31.320
<i>Subhadra was innocent.</i>

24:40.560 --> 24:43.000
<i>So I chose the innocent and killed them.</i>

24:49.760 --> 24:53.560
<i>Isa had nothing to do with them,</i>
<i>but I killed them anyway.</i>

25:08.640 --> 25:11.000
<i>The people of Gopalmath</i>
<i>had been demanding revenge</i>

25:11.080 --> 25:13.080
<i>on the Muslims for a long time,</i>

25:13.160 --> 25:15.640
<i>but my vengeance was only for Subhadra.</i>

25:19.720 --> 25:22.680
All of Isa's men have been killed.

25:23.080 --> 25:26.200
Abdul, Langur,
that motherfucker Ghaslet's brothers,

25:26.280 --> 25:28.400
Moinuddin, Bajil, Zia, all of them.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.480
Is that all, fucker?

25:31.920 --> 25:32.760
Boss?

25:34.080 --> 25:35.400
Burn down the entire slum.

25:36.480 --> 25:41.240
No one should be able to escape.

25:42.840 --> 25:48.320
Let those bastards burn in their own hell.
Motherfuckers.

25:49.000 --> 25:49.880
Okay, boss.

25:50.960 --> 25:51.800
Let's go.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.440
Motherfuckers.

25:58.280 --> 26:01.160
<i>But people thought</i>
<i>I had avenged all of them.</i>

26:01.400 --> 26:05.520
<i>By taking innocent lives,</i>
<i>I became their god.</i>

26:05.680 --> 26:08.000
<i>But Subhadra was gone forever.</i>

26:08.080 --> 26:12.240
<i>To avenge her murder,</i>
<i>I killed 80 Muslims in one night.</i>

26:14.120 --> 26:16.280
<i>But she wasn't coming back.</i>

26:16.520 --> 26:19.760
<i>No one had ever done this in Bombay.</i>

26:20.160 --> 26:23.440
<i>I knew the cops would come for me.</i>

26:30.320 --> 26:31.800
Please place the flowers here.

26:35.240 --> 26:38.400
We will complete the ritual now.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.320
Your hand...

27:02.840 --> 27:07.800
<i>Back then, I had no idea</i>
<i>that Trivedi was involved in this mess.</i>

27:08.800 --> 27:12.200
<i>But the very first time I saw his face,</i>

27:13.080 --> 27:14.680
<i>I knew this man was a dog.</i>

27:28.560 --> 27:32.280
Anything goes wrong this time
and I'm out. Did you understand?

27:36.720 --> 27:38.000
Would you like anything?

27:39.200 --> 27:40.560
One black tea, please.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.600
Why did you do this?

27:50.800 --> 27:53.040
Do you know the motto
of the Mumbai Police?

27:54.560 --> 27:57.160
<i>Sadrakshanay Khalnigranay.</i>

27:58.280 --> 28:01.080
Protect the law, destroy evil.

28:03.040 --> 28:03.880
Nayanika...

28:07.800 --> 28:09.360
She did not get justice.

28:12.200 --> 28:15.280
It was my fault. My stupidity.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.840
I should have told you.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.920
Do you know what our motto is?

28:30.560 --> 28:32.920
We protect those who protect the law.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.280
So our mottos are similar.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.120
What's the latest intel?

28:48.680 --> 28:51.760
Jojo Mascarenhas used to send
Zoya Mirza to Gaitonde.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.880
Gaitonde made her a movie star.

28:53.960 --> 28:57.720
She saw one guy
meeting Gaitonde frequently.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.520
Safari suit, bureaucratic type.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.840
He got Zoya's fake passport made
with just one call to the embassy.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.120
Some IFS type.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.080
Trivedi.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.240
Did she specifically say "IFS"?

29:11.960 --> 29:14.680
She said "IFS type." She wasn't sure.

29:15.240 --> 29:19.560
-What did he talk to Gaitonde about?
-They never spoke in front of her.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.960
They ran a company together.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.080
Blue Global. An NGO.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.480
It must be a shell company.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.360
It's been in the news lately.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.800
It sends water tankers
to drought-hit areas.

29:34.960 --> 29:38.360
Could those be the tankers
Malcolm was emptying at the warehouse?

29:38.920 --> 29:39.840
They have to be.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.880
This place is filled with trash.

30:30.960 --> 30:31.920
Why did you run?

30:34.520 --> 30:35.800
Why is this place shut?

30:36.440 --> 30:38.240
We were told that the work was done.

30:38.320 --> 30:42.040
We work on a project basis.
We're done for this year.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.400
What project?

30:45.320 --> 30:47.200
Are these your company balance sheets?

30:47.320 --> 30:49.080
-Yes.
-What?

30:49.440 --> 30:50.520
Yes.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.040
Where are the tankers?

30:52.640 --> 30:55.400
They've gone to the home minister's
drought-relief program.

30:55.600 --> 30:58.800
It's all official. You can't do this.

30:58.880 --> 30:59.960
What do the tankers carry?

31:00.680 --> 31:02.320
It's not watermelon juice, obviously.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.360
It's water.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.120
-Water?
-Why are you hitting me?

31:12.440 --> 31:13.840
Why don't you go check?

31:14.720 --> 31:16.080
Where would we do that?

31:20.280 --> 31:21.120
Where?

31:21.920 --> 31:23.040
Something's fishy.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.080
-What?
-The NGO is pretty old,

31:26.160 --> 31:28.800
but there's been no funding
for the last 10-12 years.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.280
Before that, the funds came
from the Czech Republic for three years,

31:31.360 --> 31:34.160
from Egypt for two years,
and from Uganda for three years.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.360
Hello? Yes, Sandeep, listen.

31:38.440 --> 31:43.400
Make a list of all the IFS postings
from 1996 to 2006,

31:43.480 --> 31:45.600
and see if there's a guy called Trivedi
in there.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.400
Hey, Parulkar,
what is your inspector doing?

31:56.480 --> 31:58.520
<i>-What is he up to?</i>
-What happened, sir?

31:58.600 --> 32:00.160
<i>I'll tell you what happened!</i>

32:00.240 --> 32:03.360
He came to my NGO and hit the manager.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.400
What was he doing there?

32:04.960 --> 32:07.000
-I'll look into it.
-Get looking!

32:07.280 --> 32:09.280
We'll parade you naked
around the city, bastard!

32:20.360 --> 32:22.720
Sartaj, where are you?

32:23.360 --> 32:25.120
I'm doing my job, sir.

32:25.720 --> 32:28.520
I suggest you do the same.
Earn some good karma.

33:22.120 --> 33:23.440
Look over there.

33:26.640 --> 33:28.880
Shit. Get up!

33:30.320 --> 33:31.480
-Let's go.
-Get them!

33:36.120 --> 33:37.240
Sartaj, give me the gun!

33:38.720 --> 33:40.920
-The gun! Give it to me!
-They'll kill you! Move back! Move back!

34:01.200 --> 34:02.320
I said, move back!

34:08.680 --> 34:10.880
<i>Life has taught me one thing.</i>

34:11.600 --> 34:14.120
<i>When you think you're headed to heaven...</i>

34:15.520 --> 34:17.000
<i>you often end up in hell.</i>

34:17.560 --> 34:19.159
Do you want to die, asshole?

34:19.880 --> 34:21.400
You're not scared?

34:22.520 --> 34:25.520
That name on your tag... Dwivedi.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.880
Oh, you're finally done jerking off.

34:28.960 --> 34:32.000
Keep your men in check. Bastard!

34:32.560 --> 34:33.400
Tie him up.

34:33.480 --> 34:36.040
Have you lost it? Think this over.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.159
-Hey!
-Come on!

34:39.639 --> 34:43.960
Mr. Parulkar,
have you been sleeping with Isa?

34:48.400 --> 34:49.800
Did he bathe you...

34:51.360 --> 34:53.120
spray you with perfume, and send you here?

35:24.480 --> 35:26.880
<i>I'd never felt so lonely in my life.</i>

35:27.320 --> 35:30.160
<i>But in that hell,</i>
<i>our fates were bound together</i>

35:30.240 --> 35:33.000
<i>like iron and a magnet, Sartaj.</i>

35:49.040 --> 35:54.080
<i>While all those bastards tortured me,</i>
<i>a kind man offered me water.</i>

35:54.880 --> 35:57.120
<i>A messenger of God</i>
<i>in the kingdom of Satan.</i>

35:57.680 --> 36:00.160
<i>Your father, Dilbagh Singh.</i>

36:01.960 --> 36:03.600
Get inside or I'll shoot you.

36:03.840 --> 36:04.800
Get inside!

36:05.720 --> 36:06.560
Get inside! No, ma'am...

36:14.600 --> 36:15.480
Tell me.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.120
<i>I found a guy who was in</i>
<i>the Czech Republic for three years,</i>

36:18.200 --> 36:19.640
<i>in Egypt for two, and...</i>

36:19.720 --> 36:21.640
-Trivedi?
-<i>No, Sharma.</i>

36:21.720 --> 36:23.560
It's the same guy.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.520
-Where is he?
-<i>In Mumbai.</i>

36:26.080 --> 36:27.200
-Mumbai?
-<i>Yes.</i>

36:27.280 --> 36:28.440
Send me the address!
