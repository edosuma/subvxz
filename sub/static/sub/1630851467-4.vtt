17:50.480 --> 17:53.360
No. I'm fine.

17:55.480 --> 17:56.680
But

17:57.480 --> 17:59.040
where did you get this?

18:03.480 --> 18:04.800
At a place near here.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.680
I didn't know your size,
so I took a guess.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.680
Why? Do you hate it?

18:12.480 --> 18:13.800
I love it.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.240
You love it?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.440
Yes. I like it.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.720
It reminded me of the Frog Festival.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.480
I know. It's cute.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.440
You wearing it is cuter.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.080
You're very good at sucking up.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.080
I'm not sucking up.
I told you I can't lie.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.720
I'm going to go pay the bill.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.680
Do you want to grab dinner together?

18:48.760 --> 18:50.920
You didn't have dinner yet, right?

18:55.960 --> 18:59.040
I'll treat you to something good
in return for this.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.640
In return for this?

19:04.720 --> 19:07.360
Yes. I'm grateful.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.160
There's no need to be grateful.
Anyone in that situation...

19:10.240 --> 19:13.200
To be honest,
I'm asking you out on a second date.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.440
Let's have dinner together.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.040
Are you rejecting me?

19:29.120 --> 19:30.400
No, it's not that.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.080
It's really late,
so every place is closed.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.760
They'll be open until nine.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.520
Nine? What time is it now?

19:40.280 --> 19:42.360
What time is it? It's...

19:43.880 --> 19:44.960
Seoul time.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.120
I'm a gentleman.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.440
You're good.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.520
[the Dream Theater begins playing
a late night film.]

20:35.960 --> 20:37.120
What's the movie tonight?

20:39.440 --> 20:41.160
[It reminded me of the Frog Festival.]

[I know. It's cute.]

20:44.360 --> 20:46.080

21:02.680 --> 21:04.800
Yes, I live on the fourth floor.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.080
Right, thank you for everything today.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.280
And thank you for walking me home.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.400
Get some rest.
Don't forget to take your medicine.

21:15.480 --> 21:16.560
Okay.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.600
I'll be off, then.

21:20.440 --> 21:21.920
When you get home,

21:22.480 --> 21:23.760
send me a text.

21:24.920 --> 21:25.960
A text?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.880
It's really late, you know.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.800
It'll take me over 30 minutes to get home.

21:30.880 --> 21:31.920
It's okay.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.080
But you don't have your phone now.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.560
Oh, right.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.560
Sweet dreams.

21:41.320 --> 21:42.680
I have my laptop.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.840

-Really?
-Yes.

21:48.120 --> 21:50.240
Are you sure I can wake you up?

21:51.720 --> 21:53.080
Yes, I said it's fine.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.560
I'm slow-witted, so
I'll actually do it if you say it's fine.

21:56.640 --> 21:57.680
Go for it.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.360
Go inside.

No. She asked me out on a second date.

-No way.
[-For real.]

You're here.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.240
Did he drink a lot?

27:35.600 --> 27:36.720
A little.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.360
-What?
-Because you've got a girlfriend now.

27:40.880 --> 27:41.920
Goodness.

Hey, Louis. Let's go home. Wake up.

27:45.880 --> 27:46.920
-No...
-Have a seat.

We should go home. It's past midnight.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.840

Cheers.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.760
Is it nice to be dating?

28:25.200 --> 28:26.800
I've only seen her twice.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.600
Right, so it must be nice.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.720
A second date. How exciting!

28:31.920 --> 28:34.160
It was worth shaving your beard
which took three years to grow.

28:38.360 --> 28:39.960
I'm suddenly reminded of that time.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.320
-When?
-The two of us

28:42.400 --> 28:45.160
having rice wine together
with Louis being fast asleep next to us.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.760
Doesn't it remind you of the old days?

28:47.520 --> 28:49.320
The rice wine place in Hapjeong-dong.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.960
The rice wine place
where we used to go often.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.040
You remember, right?

28:57.600 --> 28:59.880
[Danger detected.]

29:02.160 --> 29:04.920
Danger detected.
Sae-yi is talking about the old days.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.920
No. Whenever Sae-yi got tipsy
and brought up the old days in the past,

29:08.000 --> 29:09.640
she always had an ulterior motive.

29:09.720 --> 29:10.840
-That's right!
-That's right!

29:11.000 --> 29:13.120
This is dangerous. We must switch Woong

29:13.200 --> 29:14.960
into defense mode at once!

29:15.120 --> 29:16.240
-Got it.
-Got it.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.200
[Switching to defense mode.]

29:20.560 --> 29:21.920
[Bear mode on.]

29:30.840 --> 29:33.240
[Woong is now a bear.]

29:33.480 --> 29:36.240
[He cannot pick up clues or take hints.]

29:36.560 --> 29:38.520
[He's dull-witted,
and his memory is terrible now.]

29:39.520 --> 29:41.120
Okay, great!

29:42.280 --> 29:45.160
Remember the day when I got totally drunk
at the rice wine place?

29:45.240 --> 29:47.000
You came to pick me up.

29:47.400 --> 29:48.400
You remember, right?

29:48.760 --> 29:51.560
-I did?
-You know, it snowed a lot that day.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.560
It snowed?

29:53.800 --> 29:55.760
When you saw how drunk I was,

29:55.840 --> 29:57.320
you got all angry at me.

29:57.560 --> 30:00.600
Why were you so angry that day?

30:01.880 --> 30:03.000
When?

30:03.200 --> 30:05.000
When you still had that office job.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.760
Office job?

30:06.840 --> 30:08.400
When you lived in Hapjeong-dong.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.760
The rice wine place in your area.
Don't you remember?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.240
A rice wine place in Hapjeong-dong?

30:14.560 --> 30:15.600
Where was it?

30:18.280 --> 30:20.040
It's fine. Forget it.

30:21.400 --> 30:22.640
[Defense success.]

30:29.160 --> 30:31.400
[You liked me, didn't you?]

30:31.480 --> 30:32.720
That's it!

30:33.920 --> 30:35.960
I'm getting all the cold breeze
sitting here.

30:36.640 --> 30:37.720
Are you okay?

30:38.840 --> 30:40.600
[She has launched her second attack.]

30:42.040 --> 30:44.200
[Sae-yi's ulterior motive:
I want to sit next to you.]

30:44.880 --> 30:46.760
Can I sit next to you? I'm cold.

30:47.160 --> 30:48.240
Sure.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.440
You should've told me sooner.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.520
I was so hot. I'm glad.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.760
I didn't mean to change seats.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.880
What?

31:04.600 --> 31:05.680
Never mind.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.360
[Defense success.]

31:13.080 --> 31:15.280
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.160
Oh, that looks good.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.080
Aren't you eating?

31:23.840 --> 31:25.040
I'm full.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.320
It's a lot.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.640
Woong.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.760
[Her third attack begins.]

31:33.600 --> 31:36.600
[Sae-yi's ulterior motive: Drunk Speaking]

31:35.200 --> 31:36.760
Do you want to hear a secret?

31:37.480 --> 31:39.080
-No.
-Come on.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.080
It's a secret. You don't have to tell me.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.400
You know, back in university,

31:43.720 --> 31:45.800
I had a crush on someone.

31:47.760 --> 31:50.320
Do you know who that was?

31:50.920 --> 31:52.880
-Jin-soo?
-What?

31:52.960 --> 31:55.840
-It was Jin-soo.
-No. I hate him so much.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.640
-It was Jin-soo.
-No.

31:58.720 --> 32:02.040
Do you know how much I suffered
because people thought I liked him?

32:02.520 --> 32:03.880
Everyone knows that you liked him.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.960
No. Who spread that rumor?

32:07.040 --> 32:08.200
It was me.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.880
It was Jin-soo. Everyone knows.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.040
Yes.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.320
-Louis is up.
-Oh, it's a feast.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.400
-Let's go.
-It smells good.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.680
Hi, Woong.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.520
You haven't even touched the pajeon.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.720
-Excuse me. Can I get this to go?
-Yes.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.960
-I'll get it to go.
-I'm full. Let's go.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.280
-Let's go.
-Yes.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.120
Get the food.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.360
-It's fine.
-I'm sorry.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.760
[Defense success.]

32:45.680 --> 32:47.560
It's so hard to get a taxi.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.760
It's getting cold at night.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.600
[-Her fourth attack begins.]
-Again?

32:58.720 --> 32:59.960
[Sae-yi's ulterior motive:]

33:00.240 --> 33:02.440
[A physical touch]

33:03.080 --> 33:05.160
It's cold, isn't it?

33:07.080 --> 33:08.520
Is it that cold?

33:09.120 --> 33:10.120
Yes.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.360
Let's cross arms since it's cold.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.360
Try this. You'll feel less cold.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.920
[Defense success.]

33:42.800 --> 33:45.440
Don't stay up and go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.040
Aren't you going to the office?

33:47.120 --> 33:49.200
No. I'm tired. I'm going home.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.400
-Have a good night.
-Bye.

34:02.240 --> 34:05.280
[Mission clear. The bear mode is off.]

34:39.080 --> 34:41.639
[Everyone has a bulletin board
in their hearts.]

34:43.199 --> 34:44.760
[So does Sae-yi.]

34:46.480 --> 34:48.239
[To be the best art director.]

34:48.320 --> 34:50.719
[-Let's be the legend in the game field.
-I can do it.]

34:50.800 --> 34:53.320
[We are three eagle siblings.]

34:53.400 --> 34:55.480
[We are three eagle siblings.]

34:55.560 --> 34:57.560
[I'll never get married.]

34:57.640 --> 34:58.720
[I'll never get married.]

35:01.720 --> 35:03.560
[But one day,]

35:04.960 --> 35:06.640
[if I do get married...]

35:11.200 --> 35:13.640
[I'll never get married.]

35:13.720 --> 35:18.840
[It will be Woong.]

35:23.360 --> 35:29.440
[Episode 11: Lust versus Lustsaurus]

35:46.520 --> 35:47.760
It's 9 a.m.?

35:48.080 --> 35:49.880
That's crazy.
Why did the alarm go off at 9 a.m.?

35:49.960 --> 35:51.120
What do I do?

35:51.320 --> 35:54.120
[Yu-mi. It's Saturday.]

35:57.120 --> 35:59.240
That's right. It's Saturday.

35:59.320 --> 36:02.560
[Yu-mi. You're meeting Woong today.]

36:03.640 --> 36:05.760
Yes. That's today.

36:15.880 --> 36:17.240
Did she go back to sleep?

36:17.600 --> 36:18.880
Is everyone sleeping?

36:19.400 --> 36:22.480
Fashion. She's meeting him at noon.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.240
We can sleep for more.

36:24.840 --> 36:26.200
Aren't we going shopping?

36:26.280 --> 36:28.760
I don't even remember the last time
we went shopping.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.960
Are you going to wear the same clothes
and meet Woong?

36:31.040 --> 36:34.640
Woong finds everything Yu-mi wears cute.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.760
That won't last forever.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.320
How long do you think that will last?

36:38.400 --> 36:39.520
Whatever.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.160
We need new clothes!

36:45.800 --> 36:47.280
Yu-mi. Get up.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.680
We have to buy new clothes!

36:55.120 --> 36:57.920
Dear deity. I pray desperately.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.160
Please wake Yu-mi up.

37:00.400 --> 37:04.080
Please allow Yu-mi to go shopping.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.960
Your prayer woke me up,

37:12.040 --> 37:14.440
Fashion cell.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.960
Dear deity.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.240
You have come, Shopping Spree deity.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.560
As a return for your earnest,

37:21.640 --> 37:25.520
I shall sing a song.

37:25.600 --> 37:26.600
A song?

37:27.160 --> 37:28.680
♫ C, D, E... ♫

37:28.760 --> 37:30.560
♫ C, D, E, F ♫

37:30.640 --> 37:35.200
♫ What ends with onion is ♫

37:35.280 --> 37:38.240
♫ Onion, scallion, green onion ♫

37:38.320 --> 37:41.760
♫ I want to buy these all ♫

37:41.960 --> 37:43.560
Amazing.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.880
Repeat after me.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.400
The song

37:48.480 --> 37:52.040
will wake Yu-mi up.

37:53.560 --> 37:59.000
♫ What ends with onion is ♫

37:59.080 --> 38:01.880
-♫ Onion, scallion, green onion ♫

38:17.640 --> 38:18.880
That's right.

38:20.680 --> 38:22.280
Is it still on sale?

38:31.440 --> 38:33.160
It looks great on you.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.640
How did you find it at once?

38:35.720 --> 38:38.120
I've been eyeing it.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.280
I'll take this.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.960
Okay. You should get changed.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.840
I'll actually wear it now.
Can you take the tag off?

38:43.920 --> 38:46.520
Sure. It's perfect for the weather today.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.440
-Give me a sec.
-Yes.

38:53.480 --> 38:54.720
Thank you.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.360
Here are the clothes you wore.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.160
Is there a locker nearby?

38:59.240 --> 39:01.320
I can't carry it with me.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.200
We can keep it for you.

39:03.280 --> 39:04.840
Can you?

39:04.920 --> 39:06.120
Sure.

39:06.840 --> 39:09.320
-Can you give me your phone number?
-Sure.

39:15.160 --> 39:16.280
Thank you.

39:16.360 --> 39:17.560
[Goo Woong]

39:21.120 --> 39:22.280
Hello?

39:23.720 --> 39:25.440
Of course I'm up.

39:25.520 --> 39:27.080
I'm already out.

39:28.720 --> 39:32.000
Really? Did you stay up all night?

39:32.920 --> 39:35.720
Then I'll go to your house.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.560
I'm nearby.

39:39.520 --> 39:42.720
It's okay. I'll be having coffee.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.400
Okay.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.400
[I'm leaving now. Where are you?]

40:14.880 --> 40:17.760
[I'll see you there.
It won't even take five minutes.]

40:39.080 --> 40:41.520
[It's perfect.
It was a good idea to buy it.]

40:42.440 --> 40:45.600
[Yu-mi. Loosen up two buttons.]

40:46.720 --> 40:50.240
[So your collarbone shows.
Your collarbone is attractive.]

40:52.560 --> 40:53.760
Who's there?

40:59.040 --> 41:02.360
Yu-mi has a sexy collarbone.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.920
You... Lust!

41:06.160 --> 41:07.800
Let's loosen up.

41:17.400 --> 41:20.240
[Yes. That's it, Yu-mi.]

41:22.880 --> 41:25.880
Don't give unnecessary advice.
What do you know about fashion?

41:25.960 --> 41:27.920
You don't even wear pants.

41:28.560 --> 41:29.600
Don't do that!

41:31.960 --> 41:35.080
Does fashion matter?
When are they kissing?

41:37.560 --> 41:39.760
-Kiss?
-My goodness.

41:39.840 --> 41:41.160
-I'm getting nervous.
-My.

41:42.720 --> 41:45.160
Lust. What are you doing?
Don't provoke the other cells.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.040
It's time now.

41:47.120 --> 41:49.280
She should do it today. A kiss.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.080
Stop making a fuss.
They've only met a few times.

41:55.160 --> 41:57.960
A kiss isn't a coupon.
You don't have to fill up numbers.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.960
You do it when you feel like it.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.000
-That's true.
-That's true.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.160
What's true?

42:03.240 --> 42:05.160
Yu-mi's been starving for years.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.520
I've had it enough.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.040
-Yes.
-He's right.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.080
You can loosen up three buttons, Yu-mi.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.760
Unbutton everything.

42:14.880 --> 42:17.480
It's not time for you to step up yet.
Come here.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.400
Loosen up other things too.

42:48.320 --> 42:49.480
[What's this?]

42:50.200 --> 42:51.400
[What now?]

42:51.480 --> 42:54.560
[I was worried she'd spill coffee.]

42:54.640 --> 42:56.720
[This is expensive.]

42:57.640 --> 42:58.800
What's wrong?

43:00.680 --> 43:01.760
Did you fall?

43:02.280 --> 43:04.200
I spilled coffee.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.080
It's all over you.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.520
Why did you call Shopping Spree deity?
Do you want to die?

43:12.600 --> 43:14.240
-Cheapskate. Calm down.
-Seriously.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.600
It will be okay
if she washes it right away.

43:17.240 --> 43:20.200
She has to get changed for the date.

43:20.280 --> 43:23.560
What? She left her clothes
at the clothing store.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.280
-Yes. That's right.
-What?

43:28.280 --> 43:29.400
What should we do?

43:29.600 --> 43:31.200
It's okay. I actually left...

43:31.280 --> 43:32.400
Let's go to my house.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.320
Pardon?

43:35.080 --> 43:37.520
Go to your house? Let me go.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.760
-Lust. Stay calm.
-Let go.

43:41.960 --> 43:44.080
If we wash it right away...

43:44.160 --> 43:45.880
Your house?

43:46.280 --> 43:47.800
Yes. My house.

43:50.640 --> 43:52.120
Going to his house is too much.

43:52.680 --> 43:54.200
She can get changed
at the clothing store...

43:54.280 --> 43:56.000
and take her dress to a laundry.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.720
I'm glad we have spare clothes.

43:58.800 --> 43:59.840
What was that?

44:00.080 --> 44:01.480
Let's go.

44:01.640 --> 44:05.040
Let's go to Woong's house. It's a chance.

44:05.120 --> 44:06.440
What chance?

44:07.400 --> 44:08.680
A kiss.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.560
It's right there.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.400
But I left...

44:20.480 --> 44:24.040
[Yu-mi. Let's go to Woong's house.]

44:24.400 --> 44:25.480
Left?

44:26.720 --> 44:28.280
-Pardon?
-What?

44:29.400 --> 44:30.440
What did you say?

44:35.200 --> 44:36.280
Come in.

44:45.400 --> 44:47.480
-Wait here.
-Okay.

44:53.960 --> 44:56.480
It's clean.

44:59.200 --> 45:00.840
How can it be so clean?

45:13.320 --> 45:15.960
I don't have anything small.
These are the smallest.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.640
Go get changed. I'll wash your dress now.

45:23.440 --> 45:24.480
Okay.

45:50.200 --> 45:53.520
[Yes! This is where Woong takes a shower.]

45:56.240 --> 45:57.280
Do you want some coffee?

45:57.760 --> 45:59.440
Yes. Sounds good.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.280
[He must've showered just now.
I can smell it.]

46:07.360 --> 46:09.280
[It's a sexy musk scent.]

46:12.360 --> 46:13.520
[I like it.]

46:17.280 --> 46:21.400
I like how Woong is so sexy.

46:48.720 --> 46:50.760
[Yu-mi. What are you thinking?]

46:52.960 --> 46:54.040
My.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.080
It's big.

47:01.640 --> 47:04.720
Someone take him away.
Stop making Yu-mi weird.

47:05.520 --> 47:07.440
-Let me go.
-Sorry, guys.

47:07.520 --> 47:12.080
I meant the tree. The tree is big.

47:12.160 --> 47:15.160
Guys. Woong has nothing on his mind.

47:15.240 --> 47:18.320
He invited her with no other intention.
Let's not make a fuss.

47:18.880 --> 47:21.000
-Right. Let's not.
-Right.

47:24.200 --> 47:25.360
Aren't the clothes too big?

47:27.360 --> 47:28.600
Yes, a bit.

47:29.200 --> 47:30.760
They're the smallest.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.680
[No.]

47:45.040 --> 47:48.880
Lustsaurus. Calm down.

47:55.560 --> 47:58.800
Yu-mi is wearing my clothes.

48:02.960 --> 48:06.800
Her collarbone is so sexy.

48:07.680 --> 48:10.360
Everyone. Pull him. Stop him.

48:10.440 --> 48:11.560
-Okay.
-Okay.

48:12.080 --> 48:13.720
-Pull him.
-Pull him.

48:22.720 --> 48:25.120
They're a bit too big.

48:25.800 --> 48:26.800
Well...

48:27.440 --> 48:28.520
Yes.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.720
But they're the smallest.

48:33.720 --> 48:35.040
Still, you look cute.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.720
I look cute again?

48:40.640 --> 48:42.720
I must be a cute incarnate.

48:48.600 --> 48:49.800
Give it to me.

48:55.880 --> 48:58.040
Calm down.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.880
Act like a gentleman.

49:01.960 --> 49:04.720
You've been doing well so far. Good boy.

49:05.720 --> 49:07.640
Let's not ruin it.

49:07.720 --> 49:10.880
If Yu-mi finds out about you,
she'll hate...

49:11.320 --> 49:13.600
Be calm.

49:17.320 --> 49:20.320
Isn't that fabric softener?

49:21.280 --> 49:22.880
[Fabric Softener]

49:21.360 --> 49:22.360
Pardon?

49:27.960 --> 49:30.040
That's fabric softener.

49:52.600 --> 49:55.760
A kiss. Kiss now.

49:55.840 --> 49:57.440
Stay calm.

50:01.520 --> 50:02.800
Calm down.

50:04.280 --> 50:07.320
Woong.

50:19.040 --> 50:21.840
[Danger detected.]

50:22.160 --> 50:24.040
[Entering the CO2 zone.]

50:25.320 --> 50:28.880
[He can feel CO2 emitted by each other.]

50:29.480 --> 50:33.520
[When he enters this zone,
Lustsaurus goes out of control.]

50:33.600 --> 50:34.640
What?

50:36.120 --> 50:37.440
Woong.

50:37.520 --> 50:41.120
Get off her, Woong!

51:04.360 --> 51:05.400
A call.

51:06.120 --> 51:07.120
What?

51:07.360 --> 51:08.880
You're getting a call.

51:12.760 --> 51:14.520
I'll do it.

51:20.480 --> 51:23.080
[Leaving the CO2 zone.]

51:29.080 --> 51:30.160
Hello?

51:32.720 --> 51:33.800
Yes, I'm home. What's up?

51:34.400 --> 51:37.320
[Can you come over?
I can't open this file.]

51:38.240 --> 51:39.320
What?

51:39.600 --> 51:42.200
Something must've gone wrong
during the update.

51:42.480 --> 51:43.800
Louis can't seem to fix it either.

51:43.880 --> 51:45.680
Tell him to hurry over.

51:45.760 --> 51:46.960
No, let me talk to him.

51:47.640 --> 51:50.880
Hey, Woong. We've got a problem here.

51:51.520 --> 51:53.120
[Can you hurry over?]

51:53.520 --> 51:54.640
Okay.

51:58.040 --> 51:59.680
Is everything okay?

52:03.160 --> 52:04.160
I'm sorry.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.720
Looks like I have to go to the office.

52:07.080 --> 52:08.680
-Now?
-Yes.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.560
It sounds like there's a problem.
It's urgent.

52:13.720 --> 52:15.880
I just started the washing machine.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.440
Do you want to stay here? I'll be quick.

52:22.200 --> 52:23.560
How long will it take?

52:23.880 --> 52:25.040
I'm not sure.

52:25.520 --> 52:27.240
I think it'll take some time.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.760
If I'm here alone...

52:30.200 --> 52:31.560
Will you be uncomfortable?

52:31.720 --> 52:32.960
Yes, a little.

52:33.200 --> 52:35.560
But you can't go out
dressed like this anyway.

52:36.960 --> 52:38.480
You need a change of clothes.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.280
There is something

52:43.120 --> 52:44.560
I can wear instead of this.

52:53.640 --> 52:54.640
Excuse me.

52:54.720 --> 52:55.760
Hello.

52:55.840 --> 52:59.160
A young lady stopped by in the morning
and left her clothes.

52:59.240 --> 53:00.320
Right.

53:00.760 --> 53:02.640
-What's her name?
-Kim Yu-mi.

53:03.040 --> 53:04.960
Yes, here you go.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.080
-Thank you.
-No problem.

53:42.480 --> 53:43.640
The taxi is here.

53:45.640 --> 53:46.720
Get going, then.

53:48.040 --> 53:49.960
Come with me.
I'll drop you off on the way.

53:50.600 --> 53:52.520
It's okay. You're running late.

53:52.680 --> 53:54.960
You should hurry. I'll just take the bus.

53:59.120 --> 54:00.240
Go on, hurry.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.400
I'll call you.

54:22.160 --> 54:23.960
Hey, Lust. The date is over.

54:24.200 --> 54:25.360
Get some sleep now.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.240
They could've totally kissed.

54:34.560 --> 54:36.240
Gosh, it's finally calmed down.

54:37.240 --> 54:38.520
Home is a dangerous place.

54:38.840 --> 54:40.440
We almost let it run wild.

54:40.560 --> 54:42.200
Let's not invite her over again.

54:55.760 --> 54:56.880
You fixed it!

54:57.680 --> 54:58.800
Did he?

54:59.960 --> 55:01.720
I think so.

55:04.880 --> 55:05.880
There, it's fixed.

55:08.160 --> 55:10.360
My gosh. Thanks, Woong.

55:10.480 --> 55:12.480
If it weren't for you, Woong,

55:12.880 --> 55:14.240
everything would be gone now.

55:15.640 --> 55:16.720
What time is it now?

55:16.840 --> 55:18.400
You must be hungry. Let's go out.

55:18.480 --> 55:21.440
Let's go eat
something super delicious, okay?

55:21.520 --> 55:22.840
I have to go. Just eat without me.

55:22.920 --> 55:25.000
What? Aren't you hungry?

55:25.080 --> 55:26.960
-No, I'm fine.
-He left in the middle of his date.

55:27.040 --> 55:28.360
-Get going, sir.
-I'm off.

55:28.440 --> 55:29.440
See you on Monday.

55:29.520 --> 55:30.680
Thanks again.

55:34.760 --> 55:36.360
[What did I do so wrong?]

55:36.440 --> 55:38.400
[It's all out in the open anyway.]

55:38.480 --> 55:41.040
[Fine. Let me say something.]

55:41.160 --> 55:43.480
[Look. Jang Do-yeon's signature dance.]

55:43.960 --> 55:45.920
[-You see this in the show.
-Right.]

55:46.120 --> 55:48.120
[-So what about my dance?
-Come on.]

55:48.200 --> 55:49.400
[Why can't I do it?]

55:50.520 --> 55:51.640
[Goo Woong]

55:55.000 --> 55:56.160
Hello?

55:57.080 --> 55:59.240
Yes, I'm home. Are you done?

55:59.600 --> 56:01.120
I just got home.

56:01.600 --> 56:02.960
I'll drop off your dress now.

56:03.320 --> 56:05.080
It's okay. Just give it to me next time.

56:06.040 --> 56:07.120
I'll come by now.

56:07.640 --> 56:10.080
[Just give it to me next time I see you.
You must be tired.]

56:10.600 --> 56:11.960
I want to come by now.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.560
Can I come and see you now?

56:21.160 --> 56:23.200
Okay. You can come by now.

56:23.920 --> 56:25.360
I'll call you when I'm there.

56:40.480 --> 56:43.480
[There's something strange
about what Yu-mi did earlier.]

56:44.000 --> 56:47.560
She had left a change of clothes
at the clothing shop.

56:46.040 --> 56:49.480
[Clothing Shop]

56:47.920 --> 56:50.320
The shop is just a three-minute walk

56:50.400 --> 56:51.720
from where she spilled the coffee.

56:51.560 --> 56:54.840
[Woong's place]

56:51.960 --> 56:54.680
It was even closer than Woong's place,
which was a five-minute walk away.

56:57.720 --> 56:59.800
[But she came here]

56:59.880 --> 57:01.480
[and changed into Woong's clothes.]

57:01.680 --> 57:02.760
[Why did she do that?]

57:19.880 --> 57:22.920
[Goo Woong]

57:20.280 --> 57:21.600
[I'm in front of your place.]

57:50.160 --> 57:51.520
What took you so long?

57:51.880 --> 57:53.120
I wanted to iron it for you.

57:53.720 --> 57:56.040
You ironed it? You didn't have to.

57:59.480 --> 58:00.640
Did you have dinner?

58:00.720 --> 58:01.760
No, not yet.

58:01.840 --> 58:04.280
Really? Then let's go eat something.

58:04.360 --> 58:05.440
My treat.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.080
But I'm just curious.

58:08.760 --> 58:10.920
You had a change of clothes,
so why did you come to my place?

58:12.440 --> 58:13.440
Sorry?

58:13.520 --> 58:15.640
The clothing shop was closer
than my place.

58:19.880 --> 58:21.080
That was...

58:23.400 --> 58:25.400
I forgot.

58:26.600 --> 58:27.960
You did?

58:28.600 --> 58:30.200
Yes, I was too flustered.

58:31.640 --> 58:34.080
I only remembered it later.

58:34.480 --> 58:35.760
That I had bought clothes.

58:35.880 --> 58:37.920
Oh, really?

58:41.120 --> 58:42.400
Then what were you thinking?

58:43.320 --> 58:46.160
I'm only asking
because I didn't know what to think.

58:48.760 --> 58:51.240
Like I said, I forgot.

58:53.400 --> 58:54.400
Okay.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.400
What's with that smirk?

58:57.560 --> 58:58.640
I just think you're cute.

59:00.720 --> 59:01.960
You're weird.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.320
You say that all the time.

59:06.920 --> 59:08.120
What do you feel like eating?

59:08.480 --> 59:10.760
In this area, there is a restaurant

59:12.040 --> 59:13.600
that's famous for braised kimchi...

1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:16.560
[Yumi's Cells]

1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:19.520
[There's something
I really want to do with you.]

1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:21.760
[I don't know whether or not
you'll like it.]

1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:23.040
Then let's go to my place.

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:24.080
What?

1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:26.280
Lust, don't get too ahead of yourself.

1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:28.640
[This is so good.]

1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:30.080
[Who made this?]

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.400
A man and a woman can't be friends!

1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:35.720
[Why? It's just not possible.]

1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:37.800
[This girl is Sae-yi? She's pretty.]

1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:40.960
[I have to stop by the office.
Shall we go together after this?]

1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:43.800
By the way, you know my name.
