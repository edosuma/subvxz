<i>Previously on "Heartland..."<i/></i>

00:01.608 --> 00:03.075
So what's the problem?

00:03.142 --> 00:05.243
If you saw the way Ashley took
to those fancy hotels in Rome

00:05.311 --> 00:07.112
and hanging out
with this Marco guy

00:07.180 --> 00:09.114
and his rich family
in Tuscany...

00:09.182 --> 00:10.482
You ever hear of a bride
not coming back

00:10.550 --> 00:12.184
on her honeymoon
with her husband?

00:12.251 --> 00:13.719
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>I own race horses.</i>

00:13.787 --> 00:15.954
This isn't personal,
this is part of my business.

00:16.021 --> 00:18.522
Really?
Is that what Janice told you?

00:19.424 --> 00:21.059
Lou:
You have a solid case.

00:21.126 --> 00:22.293
You have to stand
in their kitchen

00:22.360 --> 00:23.895
and bang your fists
on their tables

00:23.963 --> 00:25.362
and demand justice.

00:25.430 --> 00:28.299
You know, I didn't expect
to be facing fatherhood

00:28.366 --> 00:30.501
and bankruptcy
at the same time.

00:30.569 --> 00:32.803
We're not there yet.

(Hooves thud)

01:11.974 --> 01:13.474
(Horses nicker)

01:13.542 --> 01:14.643
Ty: I can't believe Lou
didn't pull the plug

01:14.710 --> 01:16.645
when you told her
about these horses.

01:16.712 --> 01:18.046
Well, that's the thing.

01:18.114 --> 01:21.314
I haven't actually
told her yet.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.217
Well, Jack's gonna have
something to say about that,

01:24.285 --> 01:25.853
feeding an extra
half dozen horses.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.387
- Oh, come on.
- Probably not "more the merrier."

01:27.455 --> 01:29.623
What is one more
mouth to feed, huh?

01:29.691 --> 01:32.626
Especially if it's as cute
as this little guy.

01:32.694 --> 01:33.961
Where'd you pick up
the hitchhiker?

01:34.029 --> 01:37.063
I'd say more like
a stowaway.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.110
Janice: Okay, so we've got
<i>Santa Anita</i> on the 10th

01:52.178 --> 01:55.080
and <i>Golden Gate</i> on the 15th.

01:55.982 --> 01:57.649
Let's not jump the gun.

01:57.717 --> 01:59.117
Tim, come on.

01:59.185 --> 02:01.086
Everybody knows that
you gotta go where the money is.

02:01.154 --> 02:02.287
I'm sure Jack's
gonna understand.

02:02.354 --> 02:03.655
He's a reasonable man.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.157
(Laughs)

02:11.563 --> 02:13.064
(Horse whinnies)

02:13.865 --> 02:18.202
You planning to introduce me
to all these new fellas?

02:18.269 --> 02:20.004
Amy: Well, they're
from a rescue centre.

02:20.072 --> 02:21.872
I offered to board them
over the winter.

02:21.940 --> 02:24.373
Rescue horses, huh?
What are you charging?

02:25.275 --> 02:27.677
Uh, whatever they can afford.

02:27.745 --> 02:29.879
Jack: (Chuckles)
Which means nothing.

02:29.947 --> 02:31.681
Just like I figured.

02:35.619 --> 02:37.486
(Jack clucks his tongue)

02:38.422 --> 02:39.222
At least he didn't
say anything

02:39.289 --> 02:41.990
about your stowaway.

02:42.058 --> 02:44.426
Jack: It's too bad these horses
can't live off of barn mice

02:44.493 --> 02:46.895
like that cat
you got in your coat.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.333
(Kitten meows)

02:54.570 --> 02:56.003
(Low hum of chatter)

02:57.539 --> 02:58.940
I didn't order this.

02:59.007 --> 03:00.674
Mm.
Excuse me?

03:01.877 --> 03:02.944
I'm sorry,

03:03.011 --> 03:04.779
um, he ordered
the Saskatoon berry.

03:04.847 --> 03:07.014
Most of our customers
prefer apple.

03:07.082 --> 03:09.050
Uh, he ordered
Saskatoon berry pie.

03:09.118 --> 03:11.452
<i>He loves Saskatoon berries.</i>

03:12.353 --> 03:13.353
They're frozen.

03:13.420 --> 03:14.821
He doesn't care.

03:14.889 --> 03:16.623
Hi, we're gonna take care
of that for you

03:16.690 --> 03:18.391
right away.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.627
And I can I, uh,
warm that coffee up for you?

03:20.694 --> 03:22.829
No thanks.
Oh, but there is something.

03:22.897 --> 03:24.264
<i>I was wondering,</i>
<i>have you ever heard</i>

03:24.331 --> 03:26.299
of the
"Heartland Equestrian Connection"?

03:26.367 --> 03:28.768
Are you kidding?
Soraya's the manager.

03:28.835 --> 03:29.969
Miranda:
Really?

03:30.036 --> 03:31.137
Well, I checked out
their website

03:31.204 --> 03:32.437
and we were thinking
of booking it,

03:32.505 --> 03:35.074
but it's a little
on the expensive side.

03:35.142 --> 03:36.341
She could get you
a good deal.

03:36.409 --> 03:38.443
Mallory,
what happened to that pie?

03:38.511 --> 03:39.678
Do they have horses?

03:39.746 --> 03:41.480
Yeah, lots of horses.

03:41.547 --> 03:43.782
Come on, mom,
it sounds great!

03:45.584 --> 03:47.752
Saskatoon berries
and horses...

03:47.820 --> 03:50.088
it's your lucky day.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.323
Amy:
Come on, Lou,

03:52.391 --> 03:53.391
it's just a couple
of extra horses.

03:53.458 --> 03:55.359
And feed, and farriers,
and Vet bills.

03:55.427 --> 03:57.095
It adds up pretty quick,
Amy.

03:57.163 --> 03:58.429
Don't you remember
this time of year?

03:58.497 --> 04:00.397
Mom always brought
a trailer full of horses

04:00.464 --> 04:01.932
people couldn't afford
to feed for the winter.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.934
And mom had exactly
the same conversation

04:04.002 --> 04:06.837
we're having right now
except with grandpa.

04:06.905 --> 04:09.673
Yeah, but mom always
got her way.

04:09.740 --> 04:11.374
No. No-no, I just, uh...

04:11.442 --> 04:12.442
I heard you were
shuffling around

04:12.510 --> 04:13.743
some of your top guys there

04:13.812 --> 04:17.146
and thought it was worth a call,
you know?

04:17.214 --> 04:19.248
Oh, yeah, is that right?

04:20.284 --> 04:23.186
Uh-huh.
No, hey, I get it.

04:23.253 --> 04:24.353
I understand.

04:24.421 --> 04:26.255
Okay, good luck with that,
hey?

04:26.323 --> 04:28.590
Okay, sure.
Bye.

04:29.759 --> 04:31.027
(Phone beeps off)

04:31.094 --> 04:32.160
(Sighs deeply)

04:33.095 --> 04:34.462
Honey, I'm home.

04:39.535 --> 04:41.203
Peter, you made it.

04:41.270 --> 04:42.904
Look at you!

04:42.972 --> 04:45.740
There's so much of you
to look at!

04:45.808 --> 04:46.842
Both:
Mmm!

04:47.843 --> 04:48.843
How's my baby doing?

04:48.910 --> 04:49.877
Doing great.

04:49.945 --> 04:50.978
The doctor actually says

04:51.046 --> 04:52.880
it's the best baby
he's ever seen.

04:52.948 --> 04:54.148
Get out.

04:54.216 --> 04:57.284
But you are home
a week early...

04:57.352 --> 04:58.518
That can't be good.

04:58.586 --> 05:00.054
Yeah, you know.

05:00.121 --> 05:01.755
What happened with
the restructuring?

05:01.823 --> 05:03.690
Uh, didn't work.

05:03.758 --> 05:05.458
The appeals court?

05:05.525 --> 05:07.526
They're not gonna hear
the case.

05:07.594 --> 05:11.231
- So what, Bedford Oil is...?
- Bedford Oil is history.

05:11.298 --> 05:12.832
What?

05:12.900 --> 05:16.035
But it couldn't have happened
at a better time, right?

05:16.103 --> 05:18.371
Because now there's
nothing to stop me

05:18.438 --> 05:20.105
from being here with you,

05:20.173 --> 05:23.575
which is exactly
where I wanna be.

05:24.610 --> 05:25.677
Mmm.

05:28.647 --> 05:29.948
(Sighs)

05:30.016 --> 05:31.350
(Cattle moo)

05:33.452 --> 05:34.619
Jack:
Ho! Hold on now!

05:34.687 --> 05:36.120
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Keep the engine running.</i>

05:36.188 --> 05:38.089
I'm gonna have to make
a quick getaway.

05:39.457 --> 05:41.225
Hey, Jack?

05:41.293 --> 05:43.227
<i>Jack, there's something</i>
<i>i wanna talk to you about.</i>

05:43.295 --> 05:45.096
Yeah, well, make it quick.

05:45.163 --> 05:47.798
Janice and me, we're trying
to make our new schedule...

05:47.866 --> 05:48.832
Your schedule?

05:48.901 --> 05:50.401
Yeah.
Remember last year?

05:50.468 --> 05:53.103
Yeah, yeah, I remember
you were in California,

05:53.170 --> 05:54.871
while I was here,
freezing my butt off,

05:54.939 --> 05:56.206
looking after your cattle.

05:56.274 --> 05:57.507
Yeah, yeah, appreciate that.

05:57.574 --> 05:58.841
So, this year...

05:58.910 --> 06:01.444
this year, you're gonna be
a grandfather.

06:01.512 --> 06:03.246
What're you planning
on doing, Tim?

06:03.314 --> 06:05.048
<i>You gonna phone it in</i>
<i>from a racetrack</i>

06:05.116 --> 06:06.249
<i>in California?</i>

06:06.317 --> 06:07.517
Oh, Jack, come on!

06:07.584 --> 06:08.550
Come on, it's not like that!

06:08.618 --> 06:11.320

will want her old job back?

07:25.724 --> 07:27.058
Yes, I do.

07:27.126 --> 07:28.625
And we could really use
the extra paycheque.

07:28.693 --> 07:30.060
Yeah,
and I could use the help.

07:30.128 --> 07:32.729
(Utensils clatter loudly)

07:33.664 --> 07:37.334
It, it would be amazing
to have Ashley back.

07:37.402 --> 07:38.969
Tell me about it.

07:39.037 --> 07:42.339
That's why this homecoming,
it's just gotta be perfect.

07:42.407 --> 07:44.140
Yeah, well,
good luck with that.

This is lovely.

Um, can I see the horses?

08:16.971 --> 08:18.072
<i>Miranda:</i>
<i>And that's my son, Shane.</i>

08:18.140 --> 08:21.509
As you can tell,
he's big on horses.

08:21.576 --> 08:22.910
Oh, you're pregnant.

08:22.977 --> 08:24.145
How can you tell?

08:24.212 --> 08:25.479
How far along are you?

08:25.547 --> 08:27.481
Almost there, thank God.

08:27.549 --> 08:28.882
So where're you from?

08:28.950 --> 08:30.117
Fort St. John.

08:30.185 --> 08:32.019
Oh yeah, my dad lived there
a few years.

08:32.086 --> 08:33.686
Oh. Small world.

08:33.754 --> 08:36.121
It says in this brochure
you have trail rides

08:36.190 --> 08:37.756
<i>and overnight camping trips.</i>

08:37.823 --> 08:39.392
Yeah, you know,
it's kind of more seasonal.

08:41.595 --> 08:42.827
Oh.

08:43.796 --> 08:46.065
But I bet I could
wrangle you up a trail ride.

08:46.132 --> 08:47.232
Yes!

08:47.833 --> 08:49.268
(Laughs)

08:49.335 --> 08:50.735
A lava lamp.

08:51.671 --> 08:53.238
Yeah, you know those things
with the big blobs.

08:53.239 --> 08:54.573
I know what they are, Ty.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.142
Well, Caleb thinks he's found
the key to a happy reunion,

08:57.210 --> 08:59.310
but I hope
he has a backup plan.

08:59.378 --> 09:00.978
Well, as long as he doesn't
bring home another girl

09:01.046 --> 09:03.514
I'm sure it'll be fine.

09:05.084 --> 09:07.118
Just a question...

09:07.186 --> 09:10.888
How much longer are you gonna
keep bringing that up?

09:10.956 --> 09:13.357
'Til it stops hurting.

09:14.758 --> 09:15.825
(Engine rumbles)

09:23.534 --> 09:24.568

09:24.635 --> 09:25.868
Wow!

09:25.936 --> 09:27.870
I can't believe
how many horses you've got!

09:27.938 --> 09:29.506
Yeah. And if my sister
had her way,

09:29.574 --> 09:31.340
we would have a lot more.

09:31.408 --> 09:33.742
Be right back, Shane.

09:35.545 --> 09:36.945
Hey, girl.

09:37.013 --> 09:38.046
Hey.

09:40.049 --> 09:41.250
How you doing?

09:42.885 --> 09:45.254
Amy? Look, I know I should've
asked you first,

09:45.322 --> 09:47.822
but there is a kid, Shane,
staying at the Dude Ranch

09:47.889 --> 09:49.690
and he really wants
to go riding.

09:49.758 --> 09:51.259
Lou, maybe later.

09:51.327 --> 09:52.627
I've gotta de-worm
the new guys.

09:52.694 --> 09:54.662
I suppose you have
to help her, Ty?

09:54.730 --> 09:56.297
Uh, she hasn't asked me,

09:56.365 --> 09:57.798
<i>but I got a lot of school work</i>
<i>to do anyways, so.</i>

09:57.866 --> 10:00.168
Okay, I guess I'll just have
to break the kid's heart.

10:00.236 --> 10:01.269
(Hooves thud, horse nickers)

10:01.337 --> 10:02.902
Shane:
Whoa, whoa.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.904
Or he could just take himself
for a ride.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.473
Very funny.

10:06.541 --> 10:07.474
<i>Shane:</i> <i>Whoa! Ungh!
</i> <i>(Horse whinnies)</i>

10:07.542 --> 10:10.010
(Horse whinnies,
hooves thud)

10:12.079 --> 10:13.813
Shane:
(Dazed moans)

10:13.881 --> 10:15.182
What do you think
you're doing?

10:15.250 --> 10:17.784
You can't go riding
someone else's horse like that.

10:17.852 --> 10:19.852
You don't have to tell me
about riding.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.254
My dad's a rodeo cowboy.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.255
Oh.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.623
Well, if he was,

10:23.690 --> 10:25.658
he would've told you
not to ride random horses

10:25.725 --> 10:27.293
you don't know.

10:27.361 --> 10:30.496
He's away a lot,
you know, at rodeos.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.598
Well, we've got a lot
in common then.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.832
My dad was all around cowboy
four years in a row.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.269
What event does your dad do?

10:37.336 --> 10:38.503
You know...

10:38.571 --> 10:41.105
Bareback, broncs, bulls,

10:41.174 --> 10:43.141
calf roping...

10:43.209 --> 10:46.444
<i>Oh, and he drives</i>
<i>a Chuckwagon.</i>

10:47.647 --> 10:48.746
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Hmm.</i>

10:51.483 --> 10:53.984
Tim: So, Peter, another
welcome home dinner.

10:54.052 --> 10:56.987
Yeah, I think this is
actually number three,

10:57.055 --> 10:58.088
maybe four actually.
(Chuckles)

11:00.091 --> 11:01.058
So what are your plans?

11:01.125 --> 11:02.859
Dad, he just got back.

11:02.927 --> 11:07.363
Oh, as his father in-law
and your father...

11:07.431 --> 11:08.631
Just asking,
now that you're back,

11:08.699 --> 11:09.732
what are your plans?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.133
Well, um...

11:12.069 --> 11:13.203
I don't know
if you've noticed or not,

11:13.270 --> 11:14.170
or if Lou's actually
told you,

11:14.238 --> 11:15.771
but she is having a baby.

11:15.839 --> 11:17.173
Yeah, I noticed.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.774
Yeah, really?

11:18.842 --> 11:20.243
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Uh, so...</i>

11:20.311 --> 11:21.977
Long-term plan is the baby,
obviously.

11:22.045 --> 11:25.314
And short-term is
Bedford Oil's gone belly up,

11:25.381 --> 11:27.249
so I'm gonna clean out
my condo,

11:27.317 --> 11:29.618
<i>close down my office</i>
<i>and, uh...</i>

11:29.686 --> 11:31.587
<i>freeload off Jack</i>
<i>for a little while, I guess.</i>

11:31.654 --> 11:33.054
So is that long-term
or short-term?

11:33.122 --> 11:35.023
However long it takes.

11:36.226 --> 11:37.259
Appreciate that.

11:39.428 --> 11:41.262
Actually, Tim and I have
some news we'd like to share.

11:41.330 --> 11:43.063
Oh, probably not
a good time.

11:43.131 --> 11:45.065
Sweetie, if we wait till
you think it's a good time...

11:45.133 --> 11:46.500
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Just saying...</i>

11:46.568 --> 11:49.637
Janice:
Tim's selling Big River Ranch.

11:52.608 --> 11:53.541
Why?

11:53.609 --> 11:54.741
Thinking of selling it.

11:54.808 --> 11:57.944
And we're moving
to California.

11:59.347 --> 12:02.014
(Clears throat) Can we talk?

12:02.082 --> 12:03.116
Please?

12:04.918 --> 12:06.152
Be right back.

12:07.355 --> 12:08.921
Did you know about this?

12:08.989 --> 12:10.022
No.

12:15.662 --> 12:18.664
What were you thinking?
Huh?

12:18.732 --> 12:20.499
I mean, thanks,

12:20.567 --> 12:21.700
but I told you
I'd handle it.

12:21.768 --> 12:22.901
Yeah, I know, Tim,

12:22.969 --> 12:23.935
and I also know
that your family

12:24.003 --> 12:26.138
isn't the easiest thing
to deal with.

12:26.205 --> 12:27.872
We can't keep tiptoeing
around the truth,

12:27.939 --> 12:29.907
sometimes you just have
to run with it.

12:29.975 --> 12:31.075
Run with it?

12:31.143 --> 12:32.143
What do think this is,
a horse race?

12:32.210 --> 12:33.278
This is my life.

12:33.345 --> 12:35.045
Yeah, and it's my life too.

12:35.113 --> 12:37.448
We made the decision
to do this together.

12:37.516 --> 12:38.949
I guess I'm just not
used to waiting

12:39.017 --> 12:40.652
for somebody else
to make the first move.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.719
Yeah, I've noticed.

12:42.787 --> 12:44.655
(Screen door creaks)

12:44.722 --> 12:47.190
Hey, don't let me
interrupt you.

12:48.125 --> 12:50.327
<i>Tim:</i> <i>Oh, Jack, come on.
</i> <i>Don't be like that.</i>

12:50.395 --> 12:52.596
Just let him go, Tim.
He just needs time.

12:52.664 --> 12:55.365
Let him go?
He just needs time?

12:55.433 --> 12:56.600
Are you kidding me?

12:56.668 --> 12:57.768
A minute ago,

12:57.835 --> 13:00.269
you were ready
to drop a bomb on him.

13:00.337 --> 13:02.471
I'll be right back.

13:07.577 --> 13:09.079
Jack...?

13:10.146 --> 13:10.981
Hey...

13:11.118 --> 13:13.652
"Thinking of going to California".

13:13.760 --> 13:14.754
means <i> thinking</i> of going.

13:15.321 --> 13:17.822
Yeah, well, it sounds
like a done deal to me.

13:17.890 --> 13:19.191
But you know that

13:19.259 --> 13:20.091
if you're gonna be in
the horse racing business,

13:20.160 --> 13:21.293
California's the place
to be.

13:21.361 --> 13:22.594
(Exhales)

13:22.662 --> 13:25.264
Janice has her career,

13:25.331 --> 13:27.599
and to tell you the truth,

13:27.667 --> 13:29.467
I think the two of us
might have a life together.

13:29.535 --> 13:31.735
Last I heard,
you have a life here.

13:31.803 --> 13:33.437
Jack, that's why I wanted you
to know first,

13:33.505 --> 13:34.905
'cause I was hoping
we could work out

13:34.973 --> 13:36.674
a way of selling the ranch
that won't change anything.

13:36.741 --> 13:38.409
Who are you kidding?

13:38.477 --> 13:40.711
It won't change anything,
Jack...

13:41.647 --> 13:42.946
If you buy it.

13:43.882 --> 13:45.315
(Derisive chuckle)

13:45.383 --> 13:46.783
What, you think
I'm made of money?

13:46.850 --> 13:49.919
Well, I'll make you
a great deal.

13:49.987 --> 13:51.454
Come on, this place
is getting crowded.

13:51.522 --> 13:52.789
Yeah, that's right, it is.

13:52.856 --> 13:54.558
So get outta my way,
I got work to do.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.859
Okay, all right,
I'm getting outta your way.

13:56.927 --> 13:58.127
Just think about it.

13:58.196 --> 14:00.497
Remember, it's only in
the planning stages.

14:00.565 --> 14:02.798
Nothing is written in stone.

14:02.865 --> 14:03.932
Right.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.703
Next time you need help
with your cattle,

14:07.770 --> 14:09.438
hire someone!

14:16.580 --> 14:17.812
(Kitten meows)

14:19.215 --> 14:20.281
(Meows)

14:21.317 --> 14:23.218
Jack:
(Laughs softly)

14:23.285 --> 14:24.485
Well, hello there.

14:25.421 --> 14:27.455
(Kitten meows and purrs)

14:28.724 --> 14:30.425
(Affectionate coo)

14:31.793 --> 14:34.595
Lou: You know, dad was gone
for so much of our childhood,

14:34.662 --> 14:36.530
I was really hoping
he'd be around for my kid.

14:36.598 --> 14:38.498
I just don't know why
he decided to move away now.

14:38.566 --> 14:40.467
It's not dad, it's Janice.

14:40.535 --> 14:42.736
(Sighs)
I think you're right.

14:42.803 --> 14:44.304
But honestly,
dad and his girlfriend

14:44.372 --> 14:46.540
are the least of my worries
right now.

14:46.608 --> 14:48.007
What's going on?

14:49.876 --> 14:52.010
(Hushed speech) Peter.

14:52.078 --> 14:53.779
Peter?
He seemed fine at dinner.

14:53.847 --> 14:55.548
Yeah, well, he's broke,

14:55.616 --> 14:58.050
he doesn't have an office,
he doesn't have a job,

14:58.118 --> 14:59.651
and his dog was everything
to him, Amy.

14:59.719 --> 15:00.786
Without it...

15:02.122 --> 15:05.023
But you're right,
he seemed fine.

15:05.091 --> 15:07.359
But how could he be?
I mean, I wouldn't be.

15:07.426 --> 15:09.027
It is one thing
to expect the worse,

15:09.095 --> 15:12.764
and it's another
for it to actually happen.

15:23.508 --> 15:25.342
(Sighs heavily)

15:25.410 --> 15:27.779
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>Here we are, babe!</i>

15:27.846 --> 15:28.945
Home sweet home.

15:29.013 --> 15:30.147
Ashley:
(Laughs)

15:31.015 --> 15:32.382
Oh my God,
it's freezing in here!

15:32.449 --> 15:34.217
Yes it is.
Hey, hold on, hold on.

15:34.285 --> 15:37.788
You've gotta get
the full effect...

15:38.689 --> 15:40.957
(Switch clicks repeatedly)

15:42.393 --> 15:43.393
I don't get it.

15:43.460 --> 15:44.861
It was working fine
this morning.

15:44.929 --> 15:46.496
Have you been paying
the bills?

15:46.563 --> 15:47.664
Yes.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.033
Caleb...
(Annoyed sigh)

15:51.101 --> 15:52.868
Well, most of them.

15:52.936 --> 15:54.904
Okay, well, no worries.

15:54.971 --> 15:58.941
Because there's nothing
in the entire world

15:59.009 --> 16:00.910
more romantic...

16:02.178 --> 16:03.244
Than candles!

16:03.313 --> 16:05.213
(Light laughter)

16:26.167 --> 16:28.369
Hey, uh, I'm off to Calgary.

16:28.437 --> 16:29.603
I'll be back
for dinner though.

16:29.671 --> 16:31.039
Okay.

16:31.110 --> 16:33.539
What uhm...
something wrong with the crib?

16:33.541 --> 16:35.375
Lou:
No, it's just, um...

16:35.443 --> 16:37.176
It's the colour...
It's all wrong.

16:37.244 --> 16:38.511
It doesn't go with anything
in here.

16:38.579 --> 16:40.413
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what I was thinking.</i>

16:40.481 --> 16:43.049
So I'm gonna send it back.

16:43.116 --> 16:44.851
You know, Lou,
you don't have to go crazy

16:44.918 --> 16:46.519
with all the cutbacks.
We're...

16:46.587 --> 16:47.887
I know, I know.

16:47.955 --> 16:50.255
But, you know, given everything
that's happened,

16:50.323 --> 16:54.860
we don't need the world's
most expensive crib either.

16:55.795 --> 16:57.730
Thought you said
it was the colour.

17:03.403 --> 17:04.803
<i>Soraya:</i>
<i>So how was it?</i>

17:04.871 --> 17:06.971
Italy was awesome.

17:07.038 --> 17:08.939
It's the best place
I've ever been.

17:09.007 --> 17:10.273
That's why you stayed
so long?

17:10.342 --> 17:11.976
I was just having
so much fun,

17:12.042 --> 17:13.877
and we met this guy
in Tuscany... Marco.

17:13.944 --> 17:15.179
He was amazing.

17:15.247 --> 17:16.814
He speaks five languages

17:16.882 --> 17:18.715
and he knows
all these interesting places

17:18.784 --> 17:20.685
that most tourists
never go to.

17:20.752 --> 17:22.185
It really opened up my eyes.

17:22.252 --> 17:23.987
So, um,
now that you're home?

17:24.054 --> 17:25.888
I don't really have
any plans.

17:25.955 --> 17:28.090
Okay, well, if you want
your old job back...

17:28.157 --> 17:29.959
I mean, I'm really busy
with exams

17:30.027 --> 17:32.028
and Mallory sucks
as a waitress.

17:33.130 --> 17:34.765
<i>Ashley:</i> <i>I don't know, Soraya.
</i> <i>I've been thinking,</i>

17:34.832 --> 17:37.267
and I just kind of
can't really see myself

17:37.334 --> 17:38.701
as a waitress anymore.

17:38.769 --> 17:39.902
Um, I don't know

17:39.969 --> 17:41.003
if I should be
telling you this,

17:41.070 --> 17:42.004
but Caleb said you guys
could really use

17:42.071 --> 17:43.406
the extra paycheque.

17:43.473 --> 17:44.740
Guilt me out why don't you?

17:44.808 --> 17:47.410
I'm sorry,
I just really need your help.

17:47.477 --> 17:49.311
I don't know.

17:49.379 --> 17:51.980
Okay, how about until
I, I find someone else?

17:52.048 --> 17:53.148
Please, Ashley?

17:53.216 --> 17:55.784
Fine.
But book some interviews.

17:55.851 --> 17:57.118
I will, I promise.

17:57.185 --> 17:58.787
Okay. Well, when do you
want me to start?

17:58.854 --> 18:02.824
Um, table four needs
waters and menus.

18:02.892 --> 18:05.126
You're unbelievable!

18:06.995 --> 18:08.095
I may suck as a waitress,

18:08.163 --> 18:09.196
but I wouldn't count
on Ashley

18:09.264 --> 18:10.363
being employee of the month

18:10.432 --> 18:12.098
anytime soon.

18:15.737 --> 18:17.103
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>So, did it work?</i>

18:17.171 --> 18:18.505
The lava lamp?

18:18.573 --> 18:21.341
Well, I would recommend
the humble candle.

18:21.409 --> 18:22.543
It might be old school,

18:22.610 --> 18:25.378
but when it works,
it really works.

18:25.446 --> 18:27.012
So, everything's good then?

18:27.080 --> 18:29.081
There's a couple negatives.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.784
Like living in a trailer
in the middle of winter?

18:31.852 --> 18:33.118
Yeah.

18:33.186 --> 18:35.621
Or living in a trailer...
not a Villa...

18:35.689 --> 18:37.356
with me, not Marco.

18:38.258 --> 18:39.525
What?

18:39.593 --> 18:41.193
His parents owned the place
that we stayed at.

18:41.261 --> 18:42.994
You think Ashley has a thing
for another guy?

18:43.062 --> 18:44.596
I don't know.
I mean...

18:44.664 --> 18:46.297
We went on a couple of tours
with this guy

18:46.365 --> 18:48.032
and he just, he thinks
he's such a big deal.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.768
He's got degrees
up the wazoo

18:49.836 --> 18:52.471
<i>and just droned on and on</i>
<i>about all this boring stuff.</i>

18:52.538 --> 18:54.473
But the weird things is,

18:54.540 --> 18:56.541
is Ashley seemed
really into it,

18:56.609 --> 18:57.675
or him.

18:59.177 --> 19:00.945
Well, which one is it?

19:01.012 --> 19:04.281
That's the problem;
I don't know.

19:05.216 --> 19:06.517
(Vehicle rumbles)

19:07.586 --> 19:09.252
Peter:
<i>Okay, just... yeah.</i>

19:09.320 --> 19:10.554
Hold on,
just hold on a second.

19:10.622 --> 19:12.122
I'm losing you, all right?

19:16.961 --> 19:18.427
Hello?

19:18.496 --> 19:19.729
Hello?

19:19.797 --> 19:21.965
Hey, yeah, I got you.
That's better.

19:22.032 --> 19:23.500
Look, listen, man,

19:23.567 --> 19:24.901
I'm asking you
one simple favour.

19:24.969 --> 19:26.268
Can you do that for me?

19:26.336 --> 19:28.204
I mean, how long have
we known each other?

19:28.271 --> 19:29.671
No, I...

19:31.941 --> 19:33.709
Yeah.

19:33.776 --> 19:35.443
Okay, I understand.

19:36.579 --> 19:38.046
Yeah, you bet.

19:38.114 --> 19:39.414
Okay.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.049
Bye.

19:41.117 --> 19:42.618
(Phone beeps off)

19:45.654 --> 19:47.388
(Exhales in thought)

19:51.560 --> 19:53.293
(Grunts angrily)

19:53.361 --> 19:54.762
Come on!
Damn! Dammit! Dammit!

19:55.797 --> 19:57.131
Aaaggghh!

19:58.767 --> 20:00.134
(Door bangs shut)

20:05.406 --> 20:06.873
Okay,
so we've got the blanket,

20:06.941 --> 20:09.108
then the saddle,
then the cinch.

20:09.176 --> 20:10.443
Do you wanna give it a try?

20:10.511 --> 20:12.078
Sure.
Just grab here and pull up.

20:12.146 --> 20:13.513
Hey, Amy.

20:15.716 --> 20:16.750
Dad.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.753
Maybe you should
go to the house

20:20.820 --> 20:21.987
and grab a coffee

20:22.055 --> 20:23.221
and I'll take care
of this myself.

20:24.925 --> 20:26.592
Janice:
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:28.628 --> 20:30.629
So, honey, I wondered
if I could talk to you

20:30.697 --> 20:32.865
about California?

20:32.933 --> 20:35.232
I don't really wanna talk
about California, dad.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.834
I got things to do.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.502
<i>I gotta take these horses</i>
<i>up to the meadows...</i>

20:38.571 --> 20:41.573
Shane: <i>Nice belt!
</i> <i>So you're an all around cowboy?</i>

20:41.640 --> 20:43.107
Uh, once upon a time.

20:43.175 --> 20:47.278
Did you win that buckle
or buy it in a pawn shop?

20:47.345 --> 20:48.613
Shane, he won it.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.747
You know, my dad
was all-around cowboy.

20:50.815 --> 20:51.915
Really?

20:54.185 --> 20:55.919
Maybe I can help
take the horses out?

20:55.987 --> 20:58.221
No, you know what?
I'm good, but thank you.

20:58.289 --> 21:00.123
Well, you help me,
I help you.

21:00.191 --> 21:01.458
No, it's okay.

21:03.127 --> 21:05.728
Okay, maybe some other time.

21:06.663 --> 21:07.730
I'll talk to you later.

21:07.798 --> 21:08.898
Okay.

21:08.966 --> 21:11.366
Nice meeting you, kid.

21:14.204 --> 21:15.805
(Grunts of effort)

21:19.009 --> 21:20.776
Oh, please, Lou,
let me help you with that.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.010
Oh no, it's okay.

21:22.078 --> 21:23.478
I just have to get this out
onto the porch

21:23.545 --> 21:24.879
so the guy can pick it up.

21:24.947 --> 21:27.181
What do you got in here,
a crib?

21:27.249 --> 21:28.950
You're having a baby;
You might need a crib.

21:29.018 --> 21:31.653
Yeah, I know.
Just not this crib.

21:31.721 --> 21:32.988
All right.

21:33.055 --> 21:34.689
Oh God, this weighs a ton!

21:34.757 --> 21:35.991
Really, it's, it's okay.

21:36.058 --> 21:38.291
Lou, you shouldn't be
doing this by yourself.

21:38.359 --> 21:39.660
Where's your husband?

21:39.728 --> 21:40.995
Janice, I don't mean
to be rude,

21:41.062 --> 21:43.563
but what're you doing here?

21:43.632 --> 21:44.865
Uh... okay.

21:44.933 --> 21:48.869
Actually, I was hoping
that we could talk.

21:49.904 --> 21:52.439
Look,
selling your dad's ranch,

21:52.507 --> 21:53.806
moving to California,

21:53.874 --> 21:56.743
that wasn't just some
spur of the moment thing.

21:56.810 --> 21:58.144
Your dad thinks
it's important

21:58.211 --> 21:59.779
that you and Amy understand
where we're coming from,

21:59.847 --> 22:01.047
in terms of our future.

22:01.115 --> 22:02.515
And when he's ready
to talk to me,

22:02.582 --> 22:03.582
I'll listen.

22:03.651 --> 22:05.451
Lou, come on,
I'm trying here.

22:05.519 --> 22:06.986
Can you just listen to me?

22:07.054 --> 22:08.587
Okay, shoot.

22:09.789 --> 22:13.258
I know that this is...
new for everyone.

22:13.325 --> 22:15.260
Your dad and I, we haven't been
together for very long,

22:15.327 --> 22:17.696
so I know it's gonna take
some getting used to.

22:17.764 --> 22:19.631
But I'm telling you,
we have something special.

22:20.566 --> 22:21.767
What do you want me
to say, Janice?

22:21.834 --> 22:23.201
Do you want me
to congratulate you?

22:23.269 --> 22:25.103
Do you want me to thank you
for hooking up with my dad

22:25.171 --> 22:26.971
and convincing him
to move to California

22:27.039 --> 22:29.006
and completely forget
about his family?

22:29.074 --> 22:30.507
That's not fair.

22:30.575 --> 22:31.976
You know
that's not how it is.

22:32.044 --> 22:32.977
Whether you like it or not,

22:33.045 --> 22:34.611
I am part of your dad's life.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.081
Lou: <i>And guess what, Janice,</i>
<i>i don't like it,</i>

22:37.149 --> 22:38.382
okay?

22:38.449 --> 22:40.117
Wow.

22:40.185 --> 22:41.351
Well, I'm glad
that's out in the open.

22:41.419 --> 22:44.120
Tim:
Okay, whoa, whoa, you two.

22:44.188 --> 22:46.389
Don't go saying something
you're gonna regret.

22:46.456 --> 22:48.324
Yeah, I think that ship
has already sailed.

22:48.392 --> 22:50.660
Janice, wait.
Wait a second.

22:50.728 --> 22:52.261
Janice!

22:52.329 --> 22:54.263
(Door opens and closes)

22:55.199 --> 22:56.933
Lou...

22:57.001 --> 23:00.069
This thing that Janice
and me are talking about...

23:00.136 --> 23:01.536
sounds like more
than talking, dad.

23:01.604 --> 23:03.371
But you know what?
It's your life,

23:03.439 --> 23:04.707
so you can do
whatever you want.

23:04.774 --> 23:06.075
No, I can't.

23:06.142 --> 23:07.609
You and Amy are
the most important thing

23:07.677 --> 23:08.811
in my life.

23:08.878 --> 23:11.646
Really?
Then tell your girlfriend that.

23:14.783 --> 23:16.283
You know, since you like
that pony so much,

23:16.351 --> 23:17.685
you should give her a name.

23:17.753 --> 23:18.920
Oh, I already have.

23:18.987 --> 23:20.021
Her name's Pal.

23:20.089 --> 23:22.323
(Laughs)
Because he's a Palomino?

23:22.390 --> 23:24.892
No.
No, that's totally lame.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.761
No, you know, Pal...

23:26.829 --> 23:28.329
It's the name
of my dad's horse.

23:28.396 --> 23:29.330
Oh.

23:29.397 --> 23:30.797
(Car rumbles)

23:34.102 --> 23:36.469
Hey, guys.
You going for a ride?

23:36.537 --> 23:37.938
Yeah, it's gonna be great!

23:38.005 --> 23:39.005
Oh, mom, this is Amy.

23:39.073 --> 23:40.841
Hi. Nice to meet you.

23:40.908 --> 23:42.375
Watch this.

23:46.213 --> 23:48.914
Wow, it's like you were
born on the saddle!

23:48.982 --> 23:50.349
You know,
your boy's a natural.

23:50.416 --> 23:52.017
He picked out his own horse,
best in the herd,

23:52.085 --> 23:53.385
and gave her a name...

23:53.453 --> 23:55.487
Pal, like his dad's horse.

23:55.555 --> 23:58.023
Shane: Actually, it's
because she's Palomino.

23:58.091 --> 24:00.192
(Shane clucks his tongue)

24:03.929 --> 24:05.096
It's hard for a boy his age,
you know,

24:05.164 --> 24:07.632
when all he has is mom.

24:13.372 --> 24:14.572
Tim!

24:14.640 --> 24:15.673
Yeah.

24:18.476 --> 24:19.977
Sorry, do I know you?

24:20.912 --> 24:22.946
Yeah.
Fort St. John.

24:24.615 --> 24:27.350
Yeah.
Fort St. John, yeah.

24:28.286 --> 24:29.352
Yeah.

24:31.656 --> 24:33.556
Miranda: <i>Shane, get off the horse now.</i>
<i>We gotta go.</i>

24:33.624 --> 24:35.324
- But mom!
- We gotta go now.

24:46.003 --> 24:47.469
(Car door closes)

24:58.243 --> 24:59.944
<i>(Door creaks closed)</i>

25:03.481 --> 25:05.716
(Footsteps crunch in snow)

25:09.754 --> 25:10.788
Hey, ash.

25:14.793 --> 25:16.693
Is everything okay?

25:17.628 --> 25:19.629
I just noticed...

25:20.731 --> 25:23.399
It looks like Italy...

25:23.467 --> 25:25.468
<i>But with snow.</i>

25:25.536 --> 25:27.937
Come on, let's go eat.

25:28.004 --> 25:31.240
You'll freeze to death
out here.

25:33.776 --> 25:35.811
I made spaghetti.

25:44.887 --> 25:46.120
Shane:
<i>That's bull!</i>

25:46.188 --> 25:48.156
You know, you're always
wrecking stuff for me

25:48.223 --> 25:49.157
and you know it!

25:49.224 --> 25:50.257
Look, we really have to go.

25:50.325 --> 25:52.092
So, come on, please.
It's a long drive.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.661
But you promised!

25:53.728 --> 25:55.295
Now you're going back on it?

25:55.363 --> 25:56.630
It's not fair!

25:56.698 --> 25:59.433
Why do you always
do this to me?

25:59.501 --> 26:01.034
I like it here.

26:01.102 --> 26:02.803
And, you know,
what about Pal?

26:02.871 --> 26:05.105
I'll never see her again
and it's all your fault!

26:05.173 --> 26:06.639
Okay, okay...

26:06.707 --> 26:07.907
(Knock at the door)

26:08.843 --> 26:11.143
Let me just get this.

26:12.312 --> 26:13.746
- Tim!
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

26:13.814 --> 26:14.948
Yeah.

26:15.015 --> 26:18.718
Don't go anywhere.
Stick around, okay?

26:21.021 --> 26:22.521
What do you want?

26:22.589 --> 26:24.923
Tim: <i>What do I want?
</i> <i>What do you want?</i>

26:24.991 --> 26:26.925
I haven't seen you
for 10 or 12 years

26:26.993 --> 26:28.827
and you suddenly show up
unannounced?

26:28.895 --> 26:30.328
What're you doing here?

26:30.396 --> 26:31.597
There was an article
in the <i>Fort St. John Times</i>

26:31.664 --> 26:33.465
about a former rig worker

26:33.533 --> 26:36.768
being inducted into
the Cowboy Hall of Fame.

26:36.836 --> 26:38.435
An article?

26:38.504 --> 26:40.805
Yeah, it got me thinking,
you know...

26:40.873 --> 26:42.139
When we were together,

26:42.207 --> 26:43.273
the only thing you could've
been inducted into

26:43.341 --> 26:45.342
was the rye-whiskey
hall of shame.

26:45.410 --> 26:46.611
Nice. Nice.

26:46.678 --> 26:48.112
So you read an article,
you hop in your car,

26:48.179 --> 26:51.015
you drive 600 miles
to say hello?

26:51.082 --> 26:53.017
Yeah, that
and I'm glad to see

26:53.084 --> 26:54.250
you've turned a page.

26:54.318 --> 26:55.552
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Right.</i>

26:55.620 --> 26:56.953
If you're here
to relive the past,

26:57.021 --> 26:58.254
you picked the wrong time,

26:58.322 --> 27:00.123
because I've got
a totally different life.

27:00.190 --> 27:02.659
Miranda: I'm not here to
relive the past, Tim.

27:02.727 --> 27:04.060
<i>I'm just here because...</i>

27:04.128 --> 27:05.829
Because why?!

27:05.897 --> 27:07.397
Because I, um...

27:08.332 --> 27:09.698
You what?

27:09.766 --> 27:12.501
Because I want my son to,
uh...

27:13.436 --> 27:17.372
I want my son
to know who his father is.

27:21.711 --> 27:23.111
Excuse me?

27:25.381 --> 27:29.250
You're trying to tell me
that he is my son?

27:29.317 --> 27:31.218
Yeah. It's true.

27:36.692 --> 27:39.260
Why should I believe you
after all this time?

27:39.327 --> 27:40.895
<i>(Truck engine rumbles outside)</i>

27:40.963 --> 27:41.728
Oh my God! Shane!

27:41.796 --> 27:42.796
<i>(Engine rumbles)</i>

27:43.731 --> 27:45.498
<i>Miranda:</i>
<i>Shane!</i>

27:46.734 --> 27:48.702
Tim and Miranda:
Shane!

27:51.405 --> 27:52.906
Does he even drive?

27:52.974 --> 27:56.677
He's 11 years old.
What do you think?

27:57.878 --> 27:59.912
(Metallic clanking)

28:01.181 --> 28:05.084
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Yeah, used to have these
babies</i> <i>set up right in the office.</i>

28:05.151 --> 28:06.552
Nothing like
bench pressing 250

28:06.620 --> 28:09.388
to take the stress
of the day away.

28:09.456 --> 28:11.523
You can bench 250?

28:16.596 --> 28:17.662
(Sighs) Yeah.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.398
(Chuckles)

28:20.466 --> 28:22.200
No, it, uh, looks like
he found the break pedal

28:22.267 --> 28:23.935
just in time.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.403
Okay, I'll look.

28:27.339 --> 28:28.807
(Exhales heavily)

28:30.108 --> 28:32.810
I'll come back
and see you again someday.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.511
Promise.

28:34.579 --> 28:35.779
What do you think
you're doing?

28:35.847 --> 28:37.380
I just wanted
to say goodbye to Pal.

28:37.448 --> 28:40.117
Great way of doing it.
You steal my dad's truck?!

28:40.184 --> 28:41.518
What're you, like ten?

28:41.586 --> 28:43.253
- Eleven.  - Well, you're
in big trouble, okay?

28:43.321 --> 28:45.955
Your mom is worried sick.

28:46.023 --> 28:47.356
How sick?

28:47.424 --> 28:49.558
Fake sick? Real sick?

28:49.627 --> 28:51.661
Sick enough so she pukes
her guts out?

28:51.729 --> 28:54.731
Shane...
You don't mean that.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.401
She said we could stay
as long as we wanted.

28:59.469 --> 29:01.370
She just totally
changed her mind.

29:01.438 --> 29:03.605
I'm sure she has
good reason.

29:03.673 --> 29:06.008
I don't want to go.

29:06.075 --> 29:08.510
I wanna learn how to ride.

29:08.577 --> 29:10.912
I really like this horse.

29:11.814 --> 29:13.548
Well, maybe you can spend
the time you've got left

29:13.616 --> 29:16.151
doing something for Pal.

29:17.386 --> 29:18.719
Like what?

29:19.655 --> 29:22.189
She is pretty dirty,
you know.

29:23.125 --> 29:24.491
You could brush her off,

29:24.559 --> 29:25.960
clean out her feet...

29:26.028 --> 29:27.928
She'd like that.

29:39.239 --> 29:40.306
Like this?

29:41.508 --> 29:42.542
Yeah.

29:45.612 --> 29:47.947
Are you gonna tell
my mom I'm here?

29:48.015 --> 29:50.115
Well, at least
not until you finish

29:50.183 --> 29:53.052
brushing off this pony
for me.

29:53.987 --> 29:55.320
Well, like you said,

29:55.388 --> 29:57.389
you know,
she's really dirty.

29:57.456 --> 29:59.124
It might take a while.

30:02.428 --> 30:03.829
(Door opens)

30:03.897 --> 30:04.930
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Keep going, man.
</i> <i>Keep going.</i>

30:04.998 --> 30:07.665
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

30:07.733 --> 30:10.501
Hey, do you guys
need some help?

30:12.504 --> 30:14.005
Ty: One more.
Peter: (Strained grunt)

30:14.073 --> 30:15.006
You got it...

30:15.074 --> 30:16.340
Uh, honey?

30:16.408 --> 30:17.742
Peter: I got it, I
got it, I got it.

30:17.810 --> 30:18.876
(Drawn out exhale)

30:18.944 --> 30:20.644
Honey.

30:20.713 --> 30:22.545
What'd I tell ya?

30:22.613 --> 30:24.414
Where's all your office
furniture?

30:24.481 --> 30:26.449
Huh?

30:26.517 --> 30:27.984
Where's your office
furniture?

30:28.052 --> 30:30.320
I, uh... I sold it.

30:30.387 --> 30:31.722
Everything?
The aeron chairs?

30:31.789 --> 30:34.991
The flat screens?
The custom-made desks?

30:35.059 --> 30:37.760
Yeah, I divested my assets,
babe,

30:37.828 --> 30:39.461
down to the bare essentials.

30:39.529 --> 30:40.963
You're looking at the remnants
of Bedford Oil right here.

30:41.031 --> 30:42.231
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Huh.</i>

30:42.298 --> 30:44.299
Way to get back to basics.

30:44.367 --> 30:46.635
But, um,
what happens if you,

30:46.703 --> 30:49.404
I don't know,
wanna start up again?

30:49.472 --> 30:51.440
Ah... I don't know.

30:51.507 --> 30:53.175
But I'll tell you this,

30:53.243 --> 30:56.144
I'm gonna be in great shape
when it does happen.

30:56.212 --> 30:57.678
Great.

30:57.747 --> 31:00.849
Peter: All right, pally,
let's get you going here.

31:00.916 --> 31:02.049
Let's be conservative.

31:02.117 --> 31:03.917
We'll start you off
at like 160?

31:03.985 --> 31:06.419
Uh, yeah,
I can totally do that.

31:06.487 --> 31:07.888
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Yeah, you can.</i> <i>Hop on.</i>

31:07.956 --> 31:11.024
(Weights clank
and rasp against bar)

31:12.227 --> 31:14.128
So your kid steals my truck,

31:14.195 --> 31:16.630
gets off scott-free
without a slap on the wrist?

31:16.697 --> 31:17.631
That is my business.

31:17.698 --> 31:18.931
It doesn't concern you.

31:18.999 --> 31:19.966
Oh, really?
What's he gonna do next,

31:20.033 --> 31:22.268
burn the house down?

31:22.335 --> 31:23.335
You know, I've been
thinking about this.

31:23.403 --> 31:24.503
Oh, don't bother.
Okay?

31:24.571 --> 31:25.905
This trip was a big mistake.

31:25.973 --> 31:28.207
Just forget you ever
met Shane or me.

31:28.275 --> 31:30.877
It's a little late for that.

31:30.944 --> 31:33.112
You say he's my son?

31:33.180 --> 31:34.846
I say I don't believe you.

31:34.914 --> 31:36.714
Why don't you just
take my word for it?

31:36.783 --> 31:37.883
For all I know,

31:37.950 --> 31:38.716
there could've been
all kinds of men

31:38.785 --> 31:39.751
in your life back then.

31:39.819 --> 31:42.687
You dealt cards at a casino!

31:44.257 --> 31:46.925
You were always good
at the stone cold bluff.

31:46.993 --> 31:48.559
Do you really think
I'm bluffing now?

31:48.627 --> 31:51.796
Yup, and I'm gonna
call you on it.

31:51.863 --> 31:53.931
I want a DNA test.

32:00.956 --> 32:02.857
Ed: <i> So I ***</i>
<i>a couple of times.</i>

32:02.901 --> 32:04.400
My mom made this huge deal

32:04.468 --> 32:06.336
about taking like a swab
to the clinic

32:06.403 --> 32:08.438
and getting it checked out.

32:08.506 --> 32:10.406
She thinks I might be
allergic to horses.

32:10.474 --> 32:12.175
Geez, if I was allergic
to horses,

32:12.243 --> 32:13.877
I think I'd be out of a job.

32:13.945 --> 32:16.412
Well, at least I get to stay
a couple more days.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.815
And my riding's getting
way better, right?

32:18.883 --> 32:20.549
Not bouncing around
so much anymore.

32:20.617 --> 32:21.684
No, you just gotta learn

32:21.752 --> 32:23.085
how to keep
your hands quiet.

32:23.153 --> 32:24.754
Quiet hands.

32:24.821 --> 32:26.555
You know,
I gotta work on that.

32:26.623 --> 32:28.691
My dad's always telling me,
like, "watch your hands,

32:28.759 --> 32:30.459
"and don't kick the horse
too hard."

32:30.527 --> 32:32.227
Shane... enough, okay?

32:35.898 --> 32:38.232
I wanna show you something.

32:41.971 --> 32:44.205
Wow!
All these ribbons.

32:44.273 --> 32:45.540
You've even won buckles.

32:45.607 --> 32:47.241
It's like you've won
everything.

32:47.309 --> 32:50.578
Yeah, I won this one
at a team roping jackpot.

32:50.646 --> 32:52.612
You can have it.

32:52.681 --> 32:54.014
Are you kidding?

32:54.082 --> 32:56.349
No, I'm not kidding.
Here.

32:57.318 --> 32:58.552
But you gotta promise me

32:58.619 --> 32:59.419
that if someone asks
if you won that,

32:59.487 --> 33:01.521
you tell them the truth.

33:03.925 --> 33:08.294
Shane, I don't care
if you don't have a father.

33:09.229 --> 33:11.397
You don't have to lie
about that

33:11.464 --> 33:13.432
or anything else.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.501
Okay.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.338
(Music plays
and patrons chatter)

33:21.075 --> 33:22.474
(Dishes clatter)

33:28.047 --> 33:29.314
This is your table, Mallory.

33:29.381 --> 33:30.515
That means you're supposed
to clean it

33:30.583 --> 33:32.150
and I shouldn't have
to tell you that.

33:32.218 --> 33:34.285
Just getting to it.

33:39.225 --> 33:40.091
Ashley:
Ahhh!

33:40.158 --> 33:41.926
(Dishes crash)

33:41.993 --> 33:43.327
<i>Ashley:</i>
<i>Dammit, Mallory!</i>

33:43.394 --> 33:45.096
- Can't you look where you're going?!
- Sorry.

33:45.163 --> 33:46.563
Oh my God, Ashley.

33:46.631 --> 33:48.766
I'm fine, I'm fine.

33:50.235 --> 33:51.301
<i>Look, Soraya.</i>

33:51.369 --> 33:52.536
I realize that
you're stressed out

33:52.604 --> 33:53.971
and you have a lot going on

33:54.039 --> 33:55.872
and I have nothing going on,

33:55.940 --> 33:57.774
but...

33:57.842 --> 34:00.409
I can't do this anymore.

34:02.346 --> 34:04.513
Don't worry about the mess,
I'll take care of it.

34:10.987 --> 34:13.688
Grandpa,
I'm going into town.

34:13.757 --> 34:15.157
I have a doctors appointment.

34:15.225 --> 34:17.092
Oh, you're driving?
In your condition?

34:17.159 --> 34:18.293
You're sure
you don't want a lift?

34:18.360 --> 34:20.295
No, I'm good.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.429
Where's the father-to-be?

34:22.498 --> 34:23.565
Oh, I don't wanna bug him.

34:23.632 --> 34:25.266
It's just
a regular check-up.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.400
No big deal.

34:31.606 --> 34:33.340
He's working out.

34:33.408 --> 34:34.976
Hiding out, you mean.

34:35.043 --> 34:36.844
Cut him some slack,
grandpa, okay?

34:36.911 --> 34:38.579
He just lost his business.

34:38.647 --> 34:40.380
As far as I can see,

34:40.447 --> 34:43.751
he stands to lose
a lot more than that.

34:52.860 --> 34:53.760
(Door opens)

34:53.828 --> 34:56.196
(Slow steady breaths)

35:00.233 --> 35:02.134
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:02.202 --> 35:03.368
Do you have a minute?

35:03.436 --> 35:04.469
Sure.

35:14.747 --> 35:15.814
I don't get it.

35:15.881 --> 35:16.881
We moved to Dubai

35:16.949 --> 35:18.216
so that you could do
this deal.

35:18.284 --> 35:21.452
This was the biggest thing
in the world to you.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.922
And when it goes bust,
all you do is...

35:23.989 --> 35:25.156
I don't know,
put on a happy face

35:25.224 --> 35:26.624
and pump iron.

35:27.592 --> 35:30.094
What do you want me to do?

35:30.162 --> 35:31.462
Honestly, you want me
to go on a bender?

35:31.530 --> 35:32.629
What, take drugs?

35:32.697 --> 35:33.797
Lie on the couch all day

35:33.865 --> 35:35.032
and watch daytime
television?

35:35.099 --> 35:36.633
- I mean, I...
- I wanna know that you're okay.

35:36.701 --> 35:38.836
I'm not okay... Lou.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.905
I'm not.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.107
But this is me...

35:44.175 --> 35:47.477
Trying to be okay, you know?

35:48.378 --> 35:49.611
It's not just pumping iron,
honey.

35:49.679 --> 35:52.181
It's, it's...
This is my process.

35:52.249 --> 35:53.582
<i>This is how I think,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

35:53.650 --> 35:55.952
<i>And right now,</i>
<i>I'm thinking...</i>

35:56.019 --> 35:57.186
I don't have any money

35:57.254 --> 35:59.856
and I desperately
need a job.

35:59.923 --> 36:01.257
I have to figure out
some way

36:01.325 --> 36:04.425
of putting that ridiculously
expensive crib

36:04.493 --> 36:08.496
back in our nursery
before our child is born.

36:09.431 --> 36:10.465
(Sighs)

36:13.002 --> 36:14.802
Okay.

36:14.871 --> 36:16.271
Good then.

36:18.007 --> 36:20.474
Just let me know
when you're finished thinking.

36:35.190 --> 36:37.323
Hey. Hey, thought you
had the day off?

36:37.391 --> 36:41.995
I do. But I gotta put in
as many hours as I can.

36:43.063 --> 36:44.697
Got a call from Ashley.

36:44.765 --> 36:47.433
She decided to quit her job.

36:47.501 --> 36:50.370
I think it has something
to do with that guy.

36:50.437 --> 36:52.337
How? I thought
he was still in Italy.

36:52.405 --> 36:54.106
Yeah, he is, but...

36:54.173 --> 36:56.174
He's rich and smart.

36:56.242 --> 36:57.776
How's a guy like me
supposed to compete

36:57.843 --> 36:59.077
with someone like that?

36:59.145 --> 37:00.379
If you really think
this is about another guy,

37:00.446 --> 37:02.314
you should just ask her.

37:02.382 --> 37:05.384
No lava lamps,
just straight up.

37:05.451 --> 37:07.352
You're probably right.

37:08.586 --> 37:12.423
Hey, if you know
so much about women,

37:12.490 --> 37:15.626
how'd you manage to totally
screw things up with Amy?

37:21.465 --> 37:22.899
(Low hum of chatter)

37:32.909 --> 37:34.209
Hey, Lou.

37:34.277 --> 37:35.444
Dad. Hi.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.413
How are you doing?

37:37.480 --> 37:39.315
Great, dad.
Tons of energy.

37:39.382 --> 37:40.549
Thanks for asking.

37:40.616 --> 37:42.184
Good.

37:42.252 --> 37:44.553
What're you doing here?
Are you okay?

37:44.620 --> 37:47.189
Oh. Oh, I, uh,
you know...

37:47.257 --> 37:49.390
Shoulder, elbow...
(Awkward chuckle)

37:49.458 --> 37:50.925
Old rodeo injuries.

37:50.993 --> 37:52.693
They act up
when it gets cold.

37:52.761 --> 37:54.662
Hear the weather's
pretty good in California.

37:54.729 --> 37:56.797
Now, come on, Lou.

37:56.865 --> 37:58.199
You know,
I would love to chat,

37:58.267 --> 37:59.667
but I don't wanna be late
for my appointment.

37:59.734 --> 38:01.302
I'll see ya.

38:03.339 --> 38:05.005
(Clinic door opens)

38:11.579 --> 38:13.313
(Breathes nervously)

38:50.883 --> 38:51.949
Oh...

38:54.412 --> 38:57.980
Her name is Miranda Grenier.

38:58.402 --> 39:01.537
We hooked up for a while
back in Fort St. John

39:01.605 --> 39:02.805
and she's here

39:02.873 --> 39:07.043
because she claims
that her kid is my son.

39:11.014 --> 39:12.714
So is it true?

39:15.452 --> 39:16.518
Yeah.

39:17.087 --> 39:18.753
Wow.

39:18.821 --> 39:20.289
So you have a son.

39:20.357 --> 39:23.359
(Inhales sharply,
exhales heavily)

39:23.426 --> 39:26.094
I didn't know until now.

39:29.498 --> 39:31.366
So what're you gonna do?

39:31.433 --> 39:33.368
I'm not exactly sure.

39:34.336 --> 39:36.337
I think we're gonna have
to put some things on hold

39:36.405 --> 39:38.306
until we can figure out
what we're gonna do.

39:38.374 --> 39:39.773
We?

39:39.841 --> 39:42.509
Tim, I've already figured
my part out.

39:42.576 --> 39:45.178
I'm going to California...

39:46.947 --> 39:48.915
But not with you.

39:53.154 --> 39:54.221
(Door opens)

39:57.124 --> 39:58.757
(Door closes)

39:58.992 --> 40:00.893
<i>Caleb:</i> <i>Maybe I don't
speak</i> <i>six languages,</i>

40:00.960 --> 40:03.129
but I'm not an idiot,
Ashley.

40:03.196 --> 40:05.498
I know this place
doesn't look like Italy.

40:05.565 --> 40:08.600
Come on,
I deserve the truth.

40:08.668 --> 40:10.503
Are you sure
that's what you want?

40:10.570 --> 40:11.904
Of course.

40:12.538 --> 40:17.242
We've always been straight
with each other, right?

40:30.522 --> 40:33.190
Where did this come from?

40:36.594 --> 40:38.395
(Crib pieces clatter)

40:46.836 --> 40:48.904
Here, let me help.

41:03.386 --> 41:06.121
Okay, so I'm just gonna ask.

41:06.189 --> 41:07.255
Is it Marco?

41:08.224 --> 41:09.291
Marco?

41:10.393 --> 41:12.394
Yeah. Do you have a thing
for Marco?

41:12.462 --> 41:14.062
No, I don't.

41:17.065 --> 41:18.299
I don't.

41:19.867 --> 41:22.369
Well, that's good then.

41:23.805 --> 41:27.174
It's just that
he changed my life.

41:28.810 --> 41:31.412
He made me realize
how big the world is.

41:31.480 --> 41:32.745
And what, how small ours is?

41:32.813 --> 41:34.180
Caleb.

41:34.248 --> 41:36.149
He's only a couple years
older than me

41:36.217 --> 41:39.252
and he already has this
big job at a law firm.

41:39.320 --> 41:41.020
And what kind of work
experience do I have

41:41.088 --> 41:44.056
working at a diner
feed store?

41:44.992 --> 41:48.994
I just... am questioning
things now and...

41:50.930 --> 41:54.032
I don't think that I can
live like this anymore.

41:54.100 --> 41:56.335
So what are you saying?

41:56.402 --> 41:57.936
I'm saying that I...

41:58.004 --> 42:00.272
I think I wanna go back
to school.

42:00.340 --> 42:01.440
School?

42:03.075 --> 42:05.476
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, let's do it.

42:05.544 --> 42:07.077
My mom found this school

42:07.146 --> 42:08.846
where I can get credits
for my diploma

42:08.913 --> 42:11.315
and go right into
my first year of university

42:11.383 --> 42:12.550
without missing a beat.

42:12.618 --> 42:14.418
That sounds amazing, Ash.

42:14.486 --> 42:18.822
The only problem is
it's in British Columbia.

42:19.824 --> 42:21.491
So you'd move to B.C.?

42:21.559 --> 42:22.692
Well...

42:24.094 --> 42:26.563
We'd move together, right?

42:26.631 --> 42:29.132
I can't leave, Ash.

42:29.200 --> 42:33.136
I've got the whole circuit
planned out and I...

42:33.204 --> 42:34.871
We need the money.

42:34.938 --> 42:37.072
Okay, I understand,

42:39.676 --> 42:40.609
but I have to do this.

42:40.677 --> 42:42.311
