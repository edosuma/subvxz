<i>I believe in America.</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:31.990
<i>I believe in the American Dream.</i>

00:32.073 --> 00:34.243
<i>I believe in the American way of life,</i>

00:34.326 --> 00:39.122
<i>that every American should have an honest
job, a family, and a home to call their own.</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:42.834
<i>And two…
Two cars in every garage, you betcha.</i>

00:44.545 --> 00:46.380
ARCHIE: What does this car do
for 100 grand?

00:46.463 --> 00:47.965
Play with your nuts while you drive?

00:48.048 --> 00:50.634
KEATS: That would beat
the shit out of cruise control.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.887
ARCHIE: Anybody who'd drop
100 grand on a car deserves to get it stolen,

00:53.971 --> 00:55.639
then deserves
to get the shit kicked out of them.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.558
— I'm driving.
— Hell, no.

00:57.641 --> 00:58.767
What are you talking about, «No»?

00:58.850 --> 01:01.270
You drive like that
kid Corky from <i>Life Goes On.</i>

01:01.353 --> 01:03.772
Well, you drive like a goddamn maniac.

01:03.855 --> 01:06.650
Why don't you yell louder?
I don't think you woke anybody up yet.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.944
(CAR ALARM BLARING)

01:09.027 --> 01:10.487
— You're wrong.
— Uh-oh.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.670
— See the size of that guy's gun?
— That was a big gun.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.881
What's wrong with you?
You said the guy wasn't home.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.843
— We got company.
— Aw, shit!

01:43.020 --> 01:46.398
You're gonna fucking kill me, man!
I got shit to do tomorrow!

01:48.483 --> 01:50.027
No!

01:58.285 --> 01:59.828
Watch it!

02:02.080 --> 02:03.957
All right, all right, people.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.000
(HORN SOUNDING)

02:05.083 --> 02:06.376
Oh, shit!

02:07.586 --> 02:09.920
We didn't hit them.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.058
(WHINING)

02:34.905 --> 02:37.240
Okay? You happy? You messed with me.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.993
Why are we parked
in front of a police station?

02:40.077 --> 02:41.244
Yo, Officer.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.080
Excuse me.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.749
You smoke crack tonight or something?

02:45.832 --> 02:48.460
— Shh. It's gonna be fine.
— OFFICER: Yeah.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.963
Yo, could you help a brother out?
We trying to get to Disneyland.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.549
The two of you
are on your way to Disneyland?

02:54.633 --> 02:56.510
Yeah, this is my retarded friend.

02:56.593 --> 03:01.556
He's from Arkansas somewhere
and he wants to go to Disneyland.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.642
You want to go to Disneyland, man?

03:03.725 --> 03:05.227
(IMITATING SPEECH IMPEDIMENT)
Disneyland.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.229
See? It's Disneyland.

03:07.312 --> 03:10.023
Where? I love the way he says Disneyland.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.608
Say that again.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.110
Disneyland.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.946
He loves Disneyland.
So that's where we're trying to go.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.781
All right, go east on 10.

03:17.864 --> 03:18.865
KEATS: Right.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.368
When you get to the five,
you go south to Anaheim.
