Some of these have

00:50.117 --> 00:51.884
Oh, don't put
your hand in there.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.119
( straining )

00:56.122 --> 00:58.824
Are you sure
this is safe?

00:58.826 --> 01:01.060
I never said that.
Come on, Marco,
you try.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.063
Uh... no.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.697
Suit yourself.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.566
( screams )

01:07.568 --> 01:09.234
Huh? I gotcha,
I gotcha.

01:23.616 --> 01:26.118
( yawns )

01:31.724 --> 01:34.226
( screaming )

01:42.669 --> 01:44.770
Let me just...

02:01.721 --> 02:03.622
Star, we better
get out... Star!

02:03.624 --> 02:05.257
We gotta
get outta here.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.793
Star, pay attention.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.828
Just a little closer.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.278
I had it in
my hands, Marco.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.313
I have no idea
what you were thinking.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.249
I was thinking
of not dying.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.050
( screaming )

02:37.257 --> 02:39.424
We went through
all that trouble,

02:39.426 --> 02:43.162
and this sad little
scrap of sandwich is all
we have to show for it.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.997
That's because it's
not worth dying for

02:44.999 --> 02:46.832
a stupid
piece of food.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.402
I'm going
to my room.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.137
I hate when
you act like this.

02:52.139 --> 02:55.674
It makes me wonder
why we're even friends.

02:55.676 --> 02:59.678
Ugh! Where did
all these flies come from?

03:03.183 --> 03:04.917
( muffled scream )

03:04.919 --> 03:06.885
( snoring )

03:06.887 --> 03:09.087
Don't call me butterfly.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.294
So good.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.235
Marco. I'm sorry.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.903
I was a jerk.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.838
It's just I really
wanted you to try this sandwich.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.874
It's kinda smashed
and dirty,

03:28.876 --> 03:32.878
but it's still delicious.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.813
Marco?

03:34.815 --> 03:36.315
No Marco.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.884
Mr. and Mrs. Diaz.

03:38.886 --> 03:42.187
Uh, what are
you guys doing?

03:42.189 --> 03:45.157
Oh, Star, we were just
looking at Rafael's

03:45.159 --> 03:47.826
old book of
medical illustrations.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.729
Weird. Have you guys
seen Marco?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.998
I think he went
to walk the laser puppies.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.766
Try calling
his cellular phone.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.101
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

04:03.076 --> 04:07.746
( gasps ) The call is coming
from inside the house.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.382
Marco?

04:10.384 --> 04:12.251
There you are.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.453
What's up with everyone
hanging out in the dark

04:14.455 --> 04:16.822
like a bunch of
weird-y weirds?

04:19.792 --> 04:21.293
Uh, Marco,

04:21.295 --> 04:23.495
where'd you put
your legs?

04:24.764 --> 04:26.365
What have you done
with Marco?

04:26.367 --> 04:29.768
If you ever want to see
the boy alive again,

04:29.770 --> 04:34.806
bring the wand to
Ludo's castle tonight.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.009
And come alone.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.481
( laughing )

04:42.483 --> 04:44.449
You're never
going to believe.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.885
The telephone
punched me in the face.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.955
Did you find Marco?

04:49.957 --> 04:51.790
Uh...

04:51.792 --> 04:53.825
And the little fly man
was all, like,

04:53.827 --> 04:56.862
( strange accent ) If you ever
want to see Marco alive again--

04:56.864 --> 04:59.298
I just sounded Irish;
he wasn't Irish.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.966
Write that down.
The thing is,

05:00.968 --> 05:02.968
Ludo's been after my wand
ever since I got here.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.536
He's never gonna get it;
it's, like, my birthright,

05:04.538 --> 05:06.271
from a ba-jillion
generations ago,

05:06.273 --> 05:08.040
starting with my great-great
great-great-great-great...

05:08.042 --> 05:10.309
Do you like magic,
little girl?

05:10.311 --> 05:11.877
I guess.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.879
Me, too.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.181
Heck, I used to go
to Vegas every weekend

05:16.183 --> 05:18.350
for magic.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.118
The thing about
magic is,

05:20.120 --> 05:21.887
if you don't
use it wisely,

05:21.889 --> 05:25.324
you can lose
everything.

05:25.326 --> 05:28.593
Anywho, not much I can do
for you.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.028
If he's not back
tomorrow,

05:30.030 --> 05:32.831
we'll send the bloodhounds
for him.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.099
I told you
he wouldn't get it.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.600
Well, we don't
get it either.

05:35.602 --> 05:39.004
Look, this isn't
your fault, Star.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.039
If anything, we should've
been paying more attention

05:41.041 --> 05:42.607
to the two of you.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.609
I can get Marco
back from Ludo.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.345
Great. We'll take
the minivan.

05:46.347 --> 05:49.047
No, a little fly said to me
to come alone.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.016
- Hey...
- You're wrong,
by the way.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.351
This is my fault.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.853
I'll take care
of it myself.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.489
Oh, Star, come on,
don't be like... that.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.257
Forgot my scissors.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.952
Oh, why bother?

06:33.559 --> 06:35.060
What the...

06:35.062 --> 06:37.062
( clears throat )

06:38.264 --> 06:40.065
Why you bother knocking

06:40.067 --> 06:42.033
when you just walked
through my living room?

06:42.035 --> 06:43.268
I'm sorry!

06:43.270 --> 06:44.436
Go away.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.605
I just wanna talk,
Buff Frog.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.407
Buff Frog not even
my name.

06:48.409 --> 06:51.109
Really? Is it...

06:51.111 --> 06:53.011
Butt Frog?

06:53.013 --> 06:56.081
No, it's not Butt Frog.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.349
Is it Chad?

06:57.351 --> 06:59.951
My name is
Yvgeny Bulgoyaboff.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.554
Oh. So you're foreign.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.322
What do you want?

07:04.324 --> 07:06.258
Okay.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.460
At least let me
buy back your friendship.

07:08.462 --> 07:11.096
You're going to love it.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.998
Quiet.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.434
Fine.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.202
Door is open.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.445
You're not even
going to open it?

07:26.447 --> 07:28.113
BOTH: Huh?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.015
Wait. Was that...

07:30.017 --> 07:31.650
Huh? No.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.052
Marco!

07:36.222 --> 07:38.089
Tadpoles?

07:38.091 --> 07:39.391
Ugh.

07:39.393 --> 07:41.259
Tadpoles?

07:41.261 --> 07:43.428
Where are my flip-flops?

07:43.430 --> 07:45.997
Where's Marco?

07:45.999 --> 07:48.600
I don't even know
who that is.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.969
She's talking about
Karate Boy.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.971
Please, no more
laser beam.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.074
I swear, I have no idea
where your friend is.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.343
Then why did you summon me
to your castle?

07:58.345 --> 08:01.513
It is no longer
his castle.

08:01.515 --> 08:04.015
He's right.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.117
It's Toffee's castle now.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.085
Toffee?

08:07.087 --> 08:10.655
I have no idea
who that is...

08:10.657 --> 08:12.157
( babbling baby talk )

08:12.159 --> 08:13.492
Ludo gave me babies.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.126
Okay, I'm done.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.695
Wait, wait!

08:16.697 --> 08:18.063
Ludo.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.232
I wanted to say
thank you

08:20.234 --> 08:23.568
for giving me
the gift of fatherhood.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.470
That wasn't a gift,
you ding-a-ling.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.172
It was a bribe.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.074
You see, the plan was,
I'd buy your friendship

08:29.076 --> 08:30.742
with gifts because
we're friends,

08:30.744 --> 08:32.477
and in return,
you'd kick Toffee

08:32.479 --> 08:34.346
out of the castle for me
because we're friends.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.414
( laughing )

08:36.416 --> 08:38.583
But then, Star showed up,
and I don't need you anymore,

08:38.585 --> 08:40.452
you big old meatball.

08:49.362 --> 08:53.465
Well, looks like I've had
all the fun I can have in here.

08:53.467 --> 08:56.167
Oh, wait.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.303
Now I'm done.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.072
All right, you got me here.
What do you want with me?

09:01.074 --> 09:02.574
What?

09:02.576 --> 09:05.143
Tell him what you're
gonna do to him.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.646
Wait till
you hear this.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.147
Do you mind?

09:09.149 --> 09:11.049
( angry buzzing )

09:12.818 --> 09:14.386
Look, if you're
after the wand,

09:14.388 --> 09:16.187
it's harder to get
than you think.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.556
Lots of people have tried.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.591
Eat something.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.293
Could be
your last meal.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.161
Actually, I'm
totally full.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.429
But if you're hungry,
I'm a great cook,

09:24.431 --> 09:26.164
so why don't you let me
out of this chair

09:26.166 --> 09:27.265
and I'll give you a taste.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.800
Okay.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.439
There's two of you?

09:39.245 --> 09:40.378
You really should eat.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.249
I don't want
your stinking sandwich!

09:44.251 --> 09:46.084
You're a disappointment.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.586
Yeah? Well, you're boring.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.287
And you dress like
a lawyer.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.856
At least that idiot
came dressed for a good time.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.792
I feel your pain.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.729
Good luck
getting in there.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.265
Uh, there are keys
in the door.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.734
That's obviously part of
Toffee's plan.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.803
Looks like
these are yours.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.272
Those aren't mine.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.374
Wait, wait, wait!

10:09.376 --> 10:12.177
You have no idea
( panting )...

10:12.179 --> 10:14.312
how powerful Toffee is.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.415
What you need
is the element of surprise.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.417
Lucky for you,
I know this castle

10:19.419 --> 10:21.453
like the back of my hand.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.854
Oh.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.856
I sneak us into
the castle,

10:24.858 --> 10:27.225
and you blast
Toffee in the face.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.861
( malicious giggle )
It's the circle of life.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.697
- What are you talking about?
- So what do you say?
Do we have a deal?

10:32.699 --> 10:35.233
I'm not gonna touch
the hand with the mole on it.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.402
Fine.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.771
Actually, I don't wanna
touch any of your skin
with my skin.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.239
Don't trust him.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.308
I will guide you.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.609
I don't really
trust you either.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.178
I am father now.

10:48.581 --> 10:51.716
I would like my children
to grow up inside castle.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.418
You don't have
to trust me.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.553
But consider alternative.

11:07.199 --> 11:10.268
( muttering in
foreign language. )

11:10.270 --> 11:12.203
Let's go.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.505
( giggling )
Out of the way.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.440
Whoa, whoa.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.875
Before you go inside,

11:16.877 --> 11:19.844
I must tell you,
Toffee is not like Ludo.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.613
He knows about you,

11:21.615 --> 11:24.482
and he does not
like your magic.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.318
Oh, yeah? Well,
I don't like his...

11:27.320 --> 11:29.254
uh...

11:30.623 --> 11:33.191
Uh...

11:33.193 --> 11:34.893
You need to have plan.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.464
What did I say
about the pillows?

11:39.466 --> 11:41.866
I don't need pillows
on my chair.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.468
I'm an adult.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.503
Okay.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.743
No.

11:55.815 --> 11:57.882
Marco! Here's the plan.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.818
We're going in
on the count of one.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.453
That is not good plan.

12:01.455 --> 12:03.354
- One.
- No, wait. Stop.

12:03.356 --> 12:07.258
Chad, wait. Now is
our chance to get the wand.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.993
( scoffs )

12:16.302 --> 12:17.669
You made it.

12:25.377 --> 12:28.346
Supersonic...
supersonic leech bomb.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.287
What?

12:40.860 --> 12:42.660
Oh, hey, Buff Frog.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.476
( yelling )

13:17.429 --> 13:19.063
No.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.391
( gasps )
Marco!

13:46.393 --> 13:48.626
- Star!
- We did it!

13:48.628 --> 13:50.428
Ha, sorry.
I was just excited.

13:50.430 --> 13:56.367
Come on, come on,
let's get outta here.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.936
Oh, no.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.838
( struggling )

13:59.840 --> 14:01.573
Stop.

14:03.676 --> 14:08.346
That's no way to treat
our guest of honor.

14:14.486 --> 14:15.520
No, no, no, no!

14:15.522 --> 14:17.422
( straining )

14:17.424 --> 14:19.490
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

14:19.492 --> 14:21.860
That's not going
to work again.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.429
That crystal's
twice as strong now.

14:24.431 --> 14:27.031
( buzzing )

14:28.000 --> 14:29.868
Don't worry, Star.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.502
I think I got it.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.678
Fine. Take it.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.480
Now let Marco go.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.048
( laughing )

14:44.050 --> 14:46.851
Help, help, help, help!

14:46.853 --> 14:49.621
Do you think
I'm like Ludo?

14:49.623 --> 14:51.689
Just swallow it.

14:57.863 --> 15:00.632
I don't want
your wand.

15:00.634 --> 15:01.866
Destroy it.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.936
What?!

15:04.938 --> 15:07.438
Surprise!

15:07.440 --> 15:10.441
I can't.
I don't even know how.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.776
Yes, you do.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.412
It's the first spell
your mother taught you.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.115
The whispering spell.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.716
Exactly.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.919
Marco's waiting.

15:20.921 --> 15:23.054
Star.

15:28.527 --> 15:31.529
I'm sorry.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.532
( whispering )

15:42.741 --> 15:46.477
( whispering continues )

15:59.024 --> 16:01.659
( whispering )

16:08.600 --> 16:11.469
- Now let Marco go.
- ( snaps fingers )

16:19.945 --> 16:22.513
- Star.
- Run.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.650
Whoa. Oh.
My babies.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.986
Okay, you really gotta
stop shoving me.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.620
It's not over.

16:30.956 --> 16:33.758
Gentlemen.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.594
It's been a pleasure.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.255
- Lawyers.
- Look.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.990
Nature.

17:09.595 --> 17:10.828
BOTH: Eww!

17:10.830 --> 17:13.231
Where's my castle?

17:13.233 --> 17:15.700
It's gone.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.069
And where is
your wand?

17:18.071 --> 17:19.637
That's gone, too.

17:19.639 --> 17:20.905
Everything?

17:20.907 --> 17:23.574
We are no longer friends!

17:23.576 --> 17:24.876
We never were friends.

17:24.878 --> 17:28.279
You are now
my mortal enemy.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.915
This day I vow...

17:47.199 --> 17:50.168
( speaking Italian )

18:19.264 --> 18:21.799
( loud rumbling )

18:33.011 --> 18:34.846
Whoa!

18:34.848 --> 18:36.848
Upgrade.

18:43.155 --> 18:46.824
Oh, Marco, I am
so happy to see you!

18:46.826 --> 18:48.759
Uh, do I know you?

18:48.761 --> 18:51.262
Marco, it is me.
I am your dad.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.097
My dad!

18:53.099 --> 18:56.234
Ooh, ooh, my turn.
Come here... oh... ah!

18:56.236 --> 18:58.970
I'm goin' down.
Just come here
and hug your mother.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.972
This is so awkward,
Mom.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.807
It's not awkward.
Don't make it awkward.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.743
Wait. How did
you guys get here?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.745
They used your mirror.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.681
( whistling ) S-s-s-so,
basically,

19:10.683 --> 19:12.850
just to recap--

19:12.852 --> 19:15.386
- You're not going
to do that, are you?
- What, my dear?

19:15.388 --> 19:19.123
You know that thing when
you talk and every time you
get to a word with an "S,"

19:19.125 --> 19:21.025
you have that little whistle
in your front teeth.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.194
- ( whistles )
- I love you, honey.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.962
I just can't
deal with that today.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.797
Star,
you abused your magic,

19:26.799 --> 19:30.034
frightened Mr. and Mrs. Diaz,
and destroyed your wand.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.836
Did I leave
anything out?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.838
Uh, well, there's a bunch
of other stuff

19:33.840 --> 19:35.706
- you don't know about.
- Sh!

19:35.708 --> 19:36.841
No, I think
that's everything.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.409
But look,
new wand's fine.

19:38.411 --> 19:41.812
- Sort of.
- It's, uh...

19:41.814 --> 19:45.316
I'll take it and get it
cleaned for you.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.318
Please don't be mad.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.687
That looks like
a mad face.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.693
So you're not mad.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.828
Oh, I'm always mad.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.397
But I'm happy
that you're safe.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.732
( whinnying )

20:01.734 --> 20:03.201
Um, Mr. and Mrs. Diaz,

20:03.203 --> 20:05.703
I'm sorry
I made you worry.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.371
We're just glad
that...

20:07.373 --> 20:10.708
everyone's okay.
And I'm on a horse!

20:10.710 --> 20:13.411
- ( loud whinnying )
- ( screaming )

20:13.413 --> 20:15.346
MRS. DIAZ:
Where are you going?

20:15.348 --> 20:18.349
MR. DIAZ: Don't you
ride off with my wife!

20:18.351 --> 20:20.751
- ( shuddering )
- Go ahead.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.320
Mrs. Diaz,
wait up!

20:22.322 --> 20:24.889
I don't know if we're
doing the right thing, River.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.857
Darling.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.227
Glossarick. Hello!

20:29.229 --> 20:30.962
Stop yelling.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.830
I was in the tub...

20:32.832 --> 20:34.131
My lady.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.400
- We can call back.
- No, it's fine.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.903
I'm just doing
a little gardening.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.305
( gasps )
What happened there?

20:41.307 --> 20:44.909
We fear that the wand
has been cleaved.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.344
Cleaved?

20:46.346 --> 20:49.013
Now that's
a funny word.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.148
You can cleave
something apart,

20:51.150 --> 20:54.885
or you can cleave
something together.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.822
- Glossarick.
- If I go like this,

20:57.824 --> 21:01.492
with both my arms,
down goes my bath towel,

21:01.494 --> 21:03.394
cleaved from my body.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.763
( clearing throat )
Glossarick.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.131
Towel, please.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.400
No problem,
Your Highness.

21:09.402 --> 21:12.903
I hope you found
all the pieces

21:12.905 --> 21:14.272
of the wand.
