00:27.160 --> 00:29.116
Oh, God! Oh, sweetie!

00:38.640 --> 00:41.996
- Zero, zero, zero, enter.
- Stupid little thing...

00:42.200 --> 00:46.113
The simplest number possible. Even a fool
could remember it, but I overestimated you again.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.312
What's the point of it
if it's just going to make a bloody racket?

00:49.520 --> 00:52.751
- It's supposed to.
- I don't care if someone took all the furniture.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.635
I can get it back on the insurance.
I can't get a perforated eardrum back, can I?

00:56.840 --> 00:58.558
I've got to call the central station
and tell them

00:58.760 --> 01:02.753
that my mother has the memory span
of a fruit fly. Then I need to speak to you.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.918
Oh, darling! Yes, speak to me.
I'm shaking in my boots, darling.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.793
- What is it?
- Go back to bed, darling.

01:09.560 --> 01:13.314
- Have you just come in?
- Into my own house, would you believe it?

01:13.520 --> 01:15.750
After rather a gorgeous night out.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.198
- What time is it?
- 7:30.

01:18.960 --> 01:22.316
What, in the... 7:30, you say?

01:22.520 --> 01:25.478
- It means nothing to me.
- Go back to bed, darling.

01:25.680 --> 01:29.832
Don't stop there, sweetie. Keep going.
Come on, move your body.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.598
What are you smirking at?
Do you think this is funny?

01:39.800 --> 01:43.110
Oh... Funny what, darling?
Funny ha-ha-ha?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.595
You might have rung and told me
what you were doing.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.394
I was too busy doing it, darling.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.830
- What's the matter? Jealous?
- No, worried.

01:51.040 --> 01:54.589
Worried about me having fun?
Well, I was having bloody great fun.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.268
Ask her who with.
- Who with?

01:57.480 --> 02:01.189
- Jean-Pierre.
- That bastard! You didn't tell me he was around.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.517
I sort of ran into him
by accident, darling.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.508
He's over here directing a video
for a hip-rave-rap... band, darling.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.597
I thought we were going out.

02:10.800 --> 02:15.032
Thanks to you I had to spend the evening
here alone with Helena Bonham Carter here!

02:16.240 --> 02:19.357
I'm going back to bed. There's no point
in my being up at this hour.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.120
- Helps me to sleep.
- Back in your coffin.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.278
Darling!
Patsy is an insomniac, sweetie.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.948
- More like the walking dead...
- Ooohh!

02:28.160 --> 02:31.152
- How long is she here for?
- Don't know. How long are you here for?

02:31.360 --> 02:34.909
- How long?
- Until her flat has been fumigated.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.111
She can't live in it breathing fumes all day.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.550
I thought sniffing chemicals
was what she did best.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.469
I'm surprised she's not there already
with a straw stuck up her nose.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.468
She should try it. It could be the substance
that makes her socially acceptable.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.513
- Darling, it would kill her!
- Exactly.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.710
A few hormones
talking there, haven't we?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.958
- So, Jean-Pierre...
- Yeah, yeah!

02:58.160 --> 03:01.550
- Is he over long?
- It sort of depends on me, darling.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.673
He made it clear last night that he
was re-smitten. You know what I mean?

03:05.880 --> 03:07.950
- Did you...?
- Of course, darling.

03:08.160 --> 03:11.118
I know it's been a long time,
but it must be like riding a bicycle.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.788
It's just something you never forget.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.309
- I hope...
- Very careful, darling, yes! The whole packet!

03:16.520 --> 03:18.636
- Mum!
- Well...

03:18.840 --> 03:21.957
Once you've brushed off the cobwebs
there's no stopping me.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.754
- I don't want to know.
- You asked the question.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.394
No point getting all umphy
about it now, is there?

03:27.600 --> 03:29.670
- Anything else you'd like to know?
- No, thanks.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.231
If you had a few boyfriends
you wouldn't be so hung-up about it.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.192
I'm not hung-up!

03:37.400 --> 03:40.949
"I'm not hung-up! I'm not hung-up!"

03:41.160 --> 03:45.358
I know it's a sensitive issue
with someone your age, darling.

03:45.560 --> 03:49.678
A bit embarrassed
to talk about it, aren't you? Mm?

03:49.880 --> 03:54.431
My analyst says that I should let you
sort it out in your own time, and everything.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.755
But Jesus Christ, darling!

03:58.960 --> 04:02.270
Not one bloody boyfriend
in the whole time I've known you!

04:02.480 --> 04:06.951
You're not that bloody ugly.
What's the matter with you? Huh?

04:07.160 --> 04:10.038
Have you read
that Kama Sutra I gave you? No!

04:10.240 --> 04:12.800
That Dutch cap
has only ever seen the light of day.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.152
God! Here I am, your mother,
poised for your first sexual experience

04:17.360 --> 04:20.909
and night after night,
dry bloody sheets!

04:22.720 --> 04:26.315
I'm sorry, darling, but I don't want
a little moustached virgin for a daughter,

04:26.520 --> 04:28.829
so do something about it!

04:29.720 --> 04:31.278
- Unless of course...
- Mum, don't!

04:31.480 --> 04:34.438
- Mum, please!
- Unless of course...

04:34.640 --> 04:36.471
- Unless of course you're gay!
- Mum!

04:36.680 --> 04:41.037
Sweetie!
You can tell me, sweetie. Are you?

04:41.240 --> 04:44.038
- Yes, I'm gay.
- Hurrah!

04:45.640 --> 04:47.676
Well done, darling, well done!

04:47.880 --> 04:51.873
I'm glad it makes you so happy,
but actually I'm not.

04:52.080 --> 04:55.038
- What?
- I'm not gay!

04:55.240 --> 04:57.708
- I'm sorry.
- Oh?

04:57.920 --> 05:00.639
Break it to me like that,
why don't you?

05:00.840 --> 05:02.432
Yes...

05:03.760 --> 05:06.069
I suppose it's not your fault, really.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.430
Just your old mother
clutching at straws.

05:08.640 --> 05:13.191
Trying to find one exotic, interesting
feature about you, but there we are.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.156
- What time is it?
- 8:00.

05:16.360 --> 05:20.672
Wake me at 9:30. I'll let the world warm up
and have its first fag before I get up.

05:20.880 --> 05:25.032
It's usually smoked 12 packets and got
lung cancer by the time you hit the road.

05:25.240 --> 05:29.233
Get a haircut and a boiler suit so
I don't have to explain you to my friends.

05:39.920 --> 05:44.436
All night I've had to hear that!
Any more hacking and you'll bring up oil

05:45.160 --> 05:47.230
- Darling, has anyone called?
- No.

05:47.440 --> 05:51.194
- What are you wearing?
- Is it awful, darling?

05:51.400 --> 05:53.675
I'm seeing Jean-Pierre
and thought that this was him.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.836
It is him, darling, but it's not you.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.717
- Saff?
- Well, I like it.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.592
I'll change.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.030
- Are you seeing him for lunch?
- Yes. Pont de la Tour.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.959
- I thought we were having lunch.
- I always have lunch with you.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.390
- Can't I come?
- You don't like Jean-Pierre.

06:08.600 --> 06:12.195
Nobody likes Jean-Pierre.
I wouldn't talk to him, I'd talk to you.

06:12.400 --> 06:15.870
Look, I just don't want you
to make a horrible mistake again.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.911
- What do you mean?
- I'm your best friend.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.918
Let's be honest.
Your taste in men is famously bad.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.953
I've had to save you
from two disastrous marriages

06:24.160 --> 06:27.118
and some ghastly,
pathetic affairs you might have had.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.517
- What a great friend you are!
- Don't make me have lunch on my own.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.996
- You can get someone to have lunch with.
- Of course I could always get someone!

06:34.200 --> 06:38.034
It's just that I haven't got someone.
Go on...

06:39.120 --> 06:42.157
- Alright, you can come.
- Thanks, Eddy.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.591
- Are you going to the office?
- I have to sort out a few things about the shop.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.518
It's going very well, by the way.

06:47.720 --> 06:52.191
I've got gorgeous things coming in
from Kashmir, Afghanistan, Albania...

06:52.400 --> 06:56.154
I've got blankets and rugs
from Ethiopia. Dirt cheap, honestly.

06:56.360 --> 07:00.035
We'll sell lip plates from
dead Amazonian Indians as ashtrays.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.632
Don't look at me like that.
We do take the lip off!

07:06.920 --> 07:08.751
Honestly, sweetie...

07:08.960 --> 07:11.235
We've got some lovely
cooking pots from Somalia.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.557
They don't need them.
They've got no food to put in them.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.354
- And also, the best news of all time!
- Yes?

07:17.560 --> 07:19.630
- You know the villages deserted by the Kurds?
- Yes.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.398
- I bought the entire contents.
- Well done!

07:21.600 --> 07:23.352
I know, the trucks are moving in.

07:23.560 --> 07:27.189
Coups, revolutions and disasters
are all bargain basements to you!

07:27.400 --> 07:29.630
Oh, darling! They're happy camping.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.559
- What are you doing today, Pats?
- I hope she's not staying here.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.513
Will you shut up?
Will you just shut up?

07:35.720 --> 07:38.917
I'm not talking to you,
I'm talking to my friend. Is that alright?

07:39.120 --> 07:43.432
God, it's like living with a
chronically-depressed budgerigar.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.153
Shut up!

07:45.360 --> 07:49.399
- Pats?
- I'm going in to my office.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.029
- Your...
... office.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.278
The magazine? Is that still there?

07:59.480 --> 08:04.190
Of course it is. There's a little meeting
so I've got to go. About 10 minutes.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.790
- What do you do?
- Darling!

08:09.000 --> 08:12.072
Patsy is a top fashion editor
in a top magazine.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.510
Director. Executive Fashion Director.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.393
- But she's never at work.
- I am always at work.

08:17.600 --> 08:21.593
Thanks to our friend, Mr Mobile Phone.
Patsy's got that job for life.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.870
You don't mean that
she's good at something?

08:24.080 --> 08:27.072
No, darling.
She slept with the publisher.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.999
- I'm bloody good at it.
Bloody good.

08:31.080 --> 08:33.991
- So what does a fashion director do?
- Oh, darling!

08:34.200 --> 08:36.873
She gets a 50% discount
at Harvey Nichols.

08:37.080 --> 08:40.993
- It's not only that. There is skill involved.
- Of course there is.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.509
I decide what goes in the magazine.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.429
I snap my finger and raise hemlines
so high that the world is your gynaecologist.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.358
Exactly.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.236
- You get lots of free champagne.
Yes.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.510
- I direct...
The fashion.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.632
Yeah. You get
lots of little free goodies, little things.

08:57.840 --> 09:01.389
- You've never had to pay for anything!
- I paid for you, darling.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.192
A hundred times over!

09:04.720 --> 09:06.676
I'm going to go and change
and then we'll go.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.996
- Can I still come to lunch?
- Yes.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.594
To help you get to the car.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.035
I'm sure this is it.
They must have washed the outside.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.949
That's why I didn't recognise it.
I'll come with you, Patsy.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.038
We'll be about five minutes.
And then on to San Lorenzo.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.353
Are you sure this is the one, Pats?

09:30.560 --> 09:33.393
- Don't question me.
- No bells ringing...

09:35.480 --> 09:38.278
Now, floor.
Do you remember what floor?

09:38.480 --> 09:43.998
We'll just go to the reception and
ask for a map and a list. Can you do that?

09:45.760 --> 09:47.557
Yes, I recognise this.

09:47.760 --> 09:52.038
"Fifth floor. Editor, Deputy Editor,
Beauty Editor, Chief Sub-editor,

09:52.240 --> 09:55.437
"Food and Drink Editor,
Managing Editor, Friend of Editor,

09:55.640 --> 10:00.794
"Deputy Chief Sub-editor, Senior
Sub-editor, Social Editor... Excuse me.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.036
"Special Projects Editor". Now...

10:03.240 --> 10:05.674
- Are you looking at the list of editors?
- Yes.

10:05.880 --> 10:09.555
I'm not an editor, I'm a director.
I'm the Fashion Director.

10:09.760 --> 10:12.433
It's not even on this floor, Pats!

10:12.640 --> 10:15.712
Here we are. "Art Director, Style Director,
Circulation Director, Managing Director,

10:15.920 --> 10:17.592
"Ad Director, Promotions Director... "

10:18.640 --> 10:21.950
- This is it.
- As you left it, by the look of things.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.477
Nobody gets flowers
from that florist any more. Bloody cheek!

10:26.680 --> 10:29.672
- Look! Darling, Armani!
- Only "Emporio".

10:29.880 --> 10:32.440
I can just felt-pen that out.
No one will know.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.157
- Is my Chanel still in there?
This one?

10:35.360 --> 10:38.079
Yes, my little baby.
I'll wear it if there's a meeting.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.999
It frightens the editors
I'm the only one with Chanel couture.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.838
Let them kiss my buttons.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.113
- Patsy Stone.
- Hi, Mags.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.799
- You know Eddy.
- Hi.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.355
- Are you coming to the meeting?
- If I must.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.676
We need to drum up more
advertising revenue.

10:51.880 --> 10:55.316
We've lost Swiss watches, Lanson,
Nivea, two lingeries, one shower gel,

10:55.520 --> 10:57.715
- and all my tampons have dropped out.
- Oh, dear.

10:57.920 --> 11:01.708
If it wasn't for an Estée Lauder and a Rive
Gauche we'd be looking thin this month.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.480
- Is the meeting going to be long?
- Five minutes.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.274
I've got to do three lunches
and a tights launch by two.

11:07.480 --> 11:10.836
And all this with my working breakfast
with Marie Helvin floating about here.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.270
- I'll see you in two minutes.
- Right.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.916
Best editor this side of American Vogue.
Chuck me Chanel, Eds.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.918
Yes, I went.
Cheap wine and crap canapés.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.872
If I don't get
my discount card bloody quick

11:22.080 --> 11:25.436
she'll find herself plunged into obscurity
designing for British Home Stores.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.279
- Where's Magda?
- On the phone to Fergie.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.358
Just give her the bloody hat.
If she calls again I'm out.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.757
Right, I've got one minute.
Features. Catriona?

11:34.960 --> 11:36.951
- Well...
- Do something on a car.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.355
- What?
- Do something on a car. I need a new car.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.357
- A nice one, no rubbish.
- Right.

11:41.560 --> 11:45.997
- And something about how lovely champagne is.
- We could tie that in with some glasses.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.395
A friend of mine has got a shop
with lovely glasses.

11:48.600 --> 11:52.513
- Henrietta?
- Yes. Maybe we could do some lovely photos.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.075
What about people?
Who's in, who's out,

11:55.280 --> 11:57.714
who's sexy, who's not sexy,
who's clever, who's not clever.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.229
- Who's in, who's out.
- Here's my list.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.591
Cross her out, she screwed me.
Put him in, he screwed me.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.075
Do something on River Phoenix.
I really fancy him.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.874
- Right.
- River Phoenix, Mickey Rourke, Liam Neeson.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.548
Don't do anything on anyone called Freud.
I don't like them.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.797
- Bunch of no-talents with an ancestor.
- But they were in last month.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.230
So? I'm not running a bloody charity.

12:17.440 --> 12:20.989
I don't have to lick their boots because
some grandad invented penis envy.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.395
It's just that
they're pretty good friends of mine.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.512
- It doesn't matter, but...
- Beauty. Make it quick.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.314
She's fabulous.
- Puts you into perspective.

12:29.520 --> 12:35.789
Clarins, Shisheido, Paloma Picasso, Chanel
Make-up, generally...

12:36.000 --> 12:40.278
Faces-eyes, lips, nostrils...
This is all off the top of my head.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.316
Douching with mint is a thought.

12:43.520 --> 12:48.753
Ten tips on tropical toenails.
I'm thinking natural zing.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.871
"Moist" is my "word de jour".

12:51.080 --> 12:54.152
Lovely wet moist droplets.
Lusciousness.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.875
I see sun, sand, water, beach...

12:58.080 --> 13:01.390
Photo shoot-wise I'm looking at
two weeks in the Caribbean.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.194
Skin is in.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.710
And the usual-try to look more beautiful
if you want more sex.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.673
Very good.
Chuck us that wrinkle cream, will you?

13:10.880 --> 13:14.156
Get Hamish in here. I want to find out
about the restaurant I'm having lunch in.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.920
- Pats?
- It's only big names this month.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.590
Laurent, Armani, Lagerfeld,
Oscar de la Renta. No British tat.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.076
- In Moscow. Glamour in the Red Square.
- I'm not using Russians.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.271
- They're all too bloody ugly.
And fat.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.916
400 years of potato diet
won't squeeze into a Gautier cup.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.555
If I looked like that I wouldn't go out.

13:35.360 --> 13:36.634
- Magda?
- Hamish.

13:36.840 --> 13:40.196
Tell me about the restaurant
I'm having lunch at.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.675
Comfortable in the grand manner.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.077
Stuffed with plutocratic goodies
and a decent duck.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.590
The dining room is
boudoiresque, fin-de-siècle eclectic,

13:49.800 --> 13:52.394
and still fashionably uncomfortable.

13:52.600 --> 13:58.197
A melange, possibly a post-Orwellian
version of an Edwardian eatery.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.630
The food? Ecumenical in flavour,

14:00.840 --> 14:04.469
a cosmopolitan adventure
full of exuberant eclecticism,

14:04.680 --> 14:07.990
full of amuse-gueule
and gastro-credibility.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.873
No flash in the bain-marie this.

14:11.080 --> 14:15.915
A comforting air. Generally,
the tomatoes were rather pulpeuse.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.599
Ta.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.951
It's bollocks, but it uses up paper
and that's what the magazine is all about.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.596
One more thing. Patsy,
the television people have been on to us.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.314
They want us to do a make-over
on their morning programme.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.910
Their regular has dropped out. It's good for
the magazine, so I said that you'd do it.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.031
- Are you mad?
- My secretary has the details.

14:33.240 --> 14:37.677
Some miseries in shell suits are waiting
downstairs for you to perform a miracle on them.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.110
- Help me, Eddy.
- Darling, you'll be alright.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.437
- What do I do?
- Take them for a haircut,

14:43.640 --> 14:45.995
put them in a designer dress
and parade them on TV.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.555
Public humiliation, darling.
Nothing you can't handle.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.955
- Television? I go on television?
- Yes.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.469
Television? I always thought
I'd be good at that.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.352
- See you later, darling.
- Yes.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.915
- Are you going to be in later?
- Probably. Are you alright?

14:58.120 --> 15:01.032
Yes, yes. Piece of cake, sweetie.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.549
Television, eh?

15:03.760 --> 15:08.595
Oh. "Hello. Hello, I'm Patsy Stone. "

15:12.920 --> 15:14.672
Eddy.!

15:14.880 --> 15:17.713
Jesus Christ!

15:18.920 --> 15:20.876
She's not in.

15:21.720 --> 15:25.156
- So, how did the make-over go?
- How did you know about that?

15:25.360 --> 15:27.555
Mum phoned.
She's out on her own with Jean-Pierre,

15:27.760 --> 15:30.274
having a great time without you.

15:30.480 --> 15:34.439
Have you managed to turn some normal
people into fashion freaks this afternoon?

15:34.640 --> 15:38.076
Bitches! They had no taste.
We disagreed and the whole thing's off.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.157
- Oh...
- It was hideous.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.430
- What, the outfit?
- No, the fight.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.119
Her mother and I came to blows
over a geometric bob.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.596
I told her the only thing
she looked good in was a body bag.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.075
The daughter rebelled
in Yamahoto's shop. She's in hospital

15:52.280 --> 15:56.034
having a bit of modern furniture removed.
Miserable little slut!

15:56.240 --> 15:57.958
No thought for me and my reputation

15:58.160 --> 16:00.276
or the fact that I've got to be
on TV tomorrow.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.790
Two fantastic outfits and
no one to wear them. Selfish peasants!

16:04.000 --> 16:05.956
Oh, I'm weeping!

16:23.160 --> 16:26.630
- Don't bother.
Can I come in.?

16:26.840 --> 16:29.149
I know what you want
and the answer is no.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.193
- How can you know what I want?
- Well, maybe I'm wrong.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.756
I thought you had come up here to
persuade me to be a fashion victim for you.

16:35.960 --> 16:40.238
Perhaps you've come for a chat.
A nice, cosy, personal chat with me.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.715
- Don't shut that door.
- Don't you like my room?

16:42.920 --> 16:48.119
It's what I expected.
A little patterned cell Curtains...

16:48.320 --> 16:51.676
Would you mind dragging
your old carcass out of here?

16:52.560 --> 16:55.120
Look, I'm sorry.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.671
I know I pretend to hate you
and you pretend to hate me and...

17:01.880 --> 17:03.711
- I do hate you.
- Why?

17:03.920 --> 17:07.549
Because you're a despicable person
who's resented me since I was born.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.478
Before!

17:09.680 --> 17:13.309
- So why should I ever do a favour for you?
- I'll pay you.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.112
- No.
- I'm your mother's best friend.

17:15.319 --> 17:18.311
- Best friend? What kind of a friend are you?
- What kind of a daughter are you?

17:18.520 --> 17:20.875
- At least she's got fun with me.
- I care about her.

17:21.079 --> 17:25.118
Care about her? You may dress like
a Christian, but the similarity ends there.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.914
I think you do it on purpose.

17:28.119 --> 17:32.113
How long does it take to get the crease
so crisp on your jeans, you torturer?

17:32.320 --> 17:34.754
Get out!

17:36.040 --> 17:38.110
For you...

17:40.160 --> 17:43.311
- I picked those.
- They're lovely.

17:44.520 --> 17:48.308
- Look, I understand.
- You don't understand anything. Get out!

17:48.520 --> 17:50.750
At least your mother wanted you.

17:50.960 --> 17:54.316
If this is one of your terrible sob stories,
make it quick.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.795
I can hardly hold back the tears.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.596
Go on, tell me about your tragic childhood,
about your parents we never hear from,

18:01.800 --> 18:06.032
who you've probably had committed
to a home so they don't discover how old you are.

18:07.840 --> 18:12.197
They're dead.
Smirk your way out of that one, babe.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.834
I'm sorry.

18:15.520 --> 18:19.559
Yes, well... I never knew my father.

18:19.760 --> 18:23.355
My mother only knew him fairly briefly.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.551
She had me
when she was in her forties.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.751
I nursed her through her last years.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.635
It put a stopper on me finding someone
for myself and settling down,

18:31.840 --> 18:34.354
but there you are.
Anyway, it wasn't her fault.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.835
She didn't want a child.
She would've got rid of me,

18:37.040 --> 18:40.669
but she mistook
being pregnant for the menopause.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.314
When she found out it was too late.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.351
Patsy, that's awful

18:45.560 --> 18:51.112
It was having Eddy and your grandmother
that made it OK. It gave me somewhere to go.

18:51.320 --> 18:55.279
My mother didn't like having me
around the house. She said I cramped her style,

18:55.480 --> 18:57.869
made her feel old.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.116
I am Aphrodite.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.676
I live, I breathe.

19:06.880 --> 19:12.193
I am Diana.
I am Queen Dido.

19:13.200 --> 19:19.673
Oh, what a light
dances over the world!

19:19.880 --> 19:22.189
Get out of my way, child.

19:22.400 --> 19:27.474
Don't stand in my path
when I am trying to express!

19:28.960 --> 19:30.712
What are you doing here?

19:30.920 --> 19:36.313
They cut the cord when you were
born, when my body expelled you.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.193
Accept your liberty, my little void,

19:39.400 --> 19:44.155
and let this spirit be free!

19:46.520 --> 19:50.354
Anyway, I've got
Humphrey and Andre coming over.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.154
I'd rather not have you around.

19:53.360 --> 19:57.990
If you're planning to go out,
don't forget the key.

19:58.200 --> 20:03.069
I'm hoping for
a little imaginative synthesis tonight,

20:03.280 --> 20:05.748
and could frankly...

20:06.800 --> 20:11.112
...do without the competition.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.072
Beat it!

20:17.440 --> 20:21.228
- Is your mother not feeding you, dear?
You know what she's like.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.113
She's not burning her bra again, is she?

20:24.320 --> 20:27.915
We can't have you turn
into a great, gangly whatsit.

20:28.120 --> 20:31.635
Skinny, "balinky" long legs,
big banana feet.

20:33.680 --> 20:37.832
And a roly-poly pudding
that nobody wants to meet.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.116
Thanks, Mrs M.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.116
Look at you.

20:49.320 --> 20:54.155
All grief and resentful care.

20:54.360 --> 21:00.196
Here I am in this place of old age
and pallid diseases,

21:00.400 --> 21:04.518
looked after by so-called nurses.

21:04.720 --> 21:09.077
Just gropers of old bones.

21:09.280 --> 21:13.353
You come here
and hang breathless around me,

21:13.560 --> 21:16.791
hoping for me to die.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.593
Denied even my intellectual liberty.

21:22.800 --> 21:28.238
Allowed only two Barbara Cartlands a day.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.830
Forced to sit on my female eunuch

21:32.040 --> 21:35.157
to keep their dirty hands off it.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.752
The tyranny of children.

21:40.560 --> 21:44.235
Oh, for God's sake, just die!

21:47.840 --> 21:50.115
She died soon after that.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.880
The last thing she said to me was, "Why?"

21:53.080 --> 21:55.719
"Why have our swords
always been locked in battle?

21:55.920 --> 21:58.309
"Why have we always been fighting?"

21:58.840 --> 22:01.035
And what did you say?

22:01.240 --> 22:05.028
I said we had locked shields,
not swords.

22:09.240 --> 22:12.471
- Patsy, that's very sad.
- I know!

22:12.680 --> 22:14.750
- Look.
- Yes?

22:16.560 --> 22:18.039
- I...
Yes?

22:18.840 --> 22:21.752
- I'll make a deal with you.
- OK.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.030
I'll do your make-over thing
on two conditions.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.514
Name them.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.678
You move out of this house into a hotel

22:28.880 --> 22:31.713
and you allow Mum to have a boyfriend.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.512
Done.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.270
And call your grandmother.
I need an old woman, too.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.397
- What are you up for?
- I'm coming, darling, aren't I?

22:48.600 --> 22:52.115
- Aren't you with Jean-Pierre today?
- No, he's shooting his video today.

22:52.320 --> 22:56.871
- Aren't you needed in the shop?
- I'll be there later. I'm coming, OK?

22:57.840 --> 23:00.832
Wake up, Pats! Come on, darling!

23:01.040 --> 23:03.679
Sweetie.
- What time is it?

23:03.880 --> 23:08.351
Six o'clock in the morning.
Don't even think about it, babe.

23:08.560 --> 23:12.109
- What time did you get to sleep?
- I nodded off at about three a. m.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.198
I tried at midnight,
took some pills at one. Couldn't do it.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.631
It's so long since I actually remember
going to sleep instead of passing out.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.796
- How did we do it?
I don't know.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.594
How did you get on with
Saff and the old woman?

23:23.800 --> 23:26.792
Your mother wears anything I'll tell her to,
but that bitch daughter of yours!

23:27.000 --> 23:30.197
She just won't wear
the dress I want her to.

23:30.400 --> 23:33.551
This might sound rather odd,
but have you tried saying "please"?

23:33.760 --> 23:36.672
- What?
- Sometimes it works with Saffy.

23:37.560 --> 23:40.279
- I can't.
- Try. It's over quite quickly, darling.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.835
No, I mean I can't say it.

23:43.040 --> 23:46.715
- Don't make me say it. It's difficult for me.
- Just say "please" and smile.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.150
I can't smile like that.
I can't afford the wrinkles.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.112
- You do it, Ed.
No, sweetie...

23:51.320 --> 23:55.359
Saffy, darling. Pats has got something
she wants to ask you, darling.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.994
Do it now. Go on!

23:59.000 --> 24:00.877
Smile!

24:06.160 --> 24:08.674
- Come on. "Please".
- Please.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.110
Yeah, will you wear the dress?

24:11.320 --> 24:14.630
OK. Come on, we're going to be late.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.673
Come on, you two.
We're due in Make-up at seven.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.952
- I wonder if Auntie Clare Rayner will be on.
- No, I'm on.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.151
Yes, I know, but she may be on, too.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.954
I do hope so.
I'm always writing to Clare.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.435
What for? There's nothing
the matter with you.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.200
Well, I did think once
that I had that disease.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.709
You know the one
that makes you forget everything.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.434
- Alzheimer's.
- The one you get when you're old.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.153
- Alzheimer's.
- What's it called?

24:40.360 --> 24:43.238
- Alzheimer's!
- I can't remember.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.759
Come on, we'll be late!

24:45.480 --> 24:49.359
It seems strange
that the make-over should be on us.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.632
Come on, darling. Come on, sweetie!

24:54.400 --> 24:56.038
There's another one here...

24:56.240 --> 24:58.470
- You're alright? You're not nervous?
- No.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.716
- Have you got a catch-phrase to sum up with?
- What?

25:00.920 --> 25:03.753
Think about it. A little catch-phrase.
Sum up with something, say something.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.110
Yeah, I could do it in my sleep.

25:06.320 --> 25:11.997
- We'll talk to the Sports Personality of the Year...
Contradiction in terms...

25:12.200 --> 25:17.149
...but now it's on to my favourite spot
which is the fashion spot.

25:17.360 --> 25:22.036
We're lucky enough to be joined by
a top fashion editor spot person

25:22.240 --> 25:24.310
from Ella magazine: Patsy Stone.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.511
Patsy, hello.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.112
Yes, cheers. Thanks a lot.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.915
Am I right in thinking
that you've changed the fashion spot

25:34.120 --> 25:36.554
into a sort of make-over spot this week?

25:36.760 --> 25:39.274
How did you get on?

25:39.480 --> 25:42.153
Yes, really... well W-well

25:42.360 --> 25:47.036
I see... Am I right in thinking that you
took two ordinary members of the public

25:47.240 --> 25:49.037
and made their dreams come true?

25:49.240 --> 25:50.912
Y- yes, that's right.

25:51.120 --> 25:57.355
I see. Could we perhaps take a look at
a photo of our two "make-over spotters"?

25:57.560 --> 26:01.269
No, no, that's a photograph
of my new son. Isn't he sweet?

26:01.480 --> 26:03.277
Have we got a photo?

26:03.480 --> 26:08.156
Yes, we have. I'd say there's an awful lot
of work to be done there, wouldn't you?

26:08.360 --> 26:10.430
Yes, cheers, thanks a lot.

26:10.640 --> 26:15.430
Right... Perhaps now we're going to
bring in our make-over spotters

26:15.640 --> 26:17.517
and see what they look like now.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.837
There's something wonderful!
A lovely outfit, there.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.396
Sort of a mixture between a colander
and a chain-mail outfit, isn't it?

26:24.600 --> 26:27.956
And here comes a lady
in the more mature years.

26:28.160 --> 26:31.118
Not afraid to wear black
in the evening of her life, I notice.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.197
Do sit down. Marvellous!

26:33.400 --> 26:36.870
- Is Clare going to be on?
- No, we lost her with the franchise.

26:37.080 --> 26:38.798
Gone.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.118
They're not exactly workaday outfits,
are they, Patsy?

26:43.320 --> 26:48.269
You'd feel a bit of a fool going to
the supermarket wearing one of those!

26:50.120 --> 26:52.236
Yes, cheers, thanks a lot.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.351
Why don't we ask our guinea-pigs

26:54.560 --> 26:58.269
exactly how they feel about
the particular outfits they're wearing?

26:58.480 --> 27:00.755
How do you feel about them, dear?

27:00.960 --> 27:04.270
I'm more of an M & S person myself.

27:04.480 --> 27:07.313
You know? So am I.
You can't fail, can you?

27:07.520 --> 27:11.593
Anyway, moving on... Thank you
very much for coming along, everybody.

27:11.800 --> 27:15.156
Patsy. Marvellous work,
if not a bit way-out for me!

27:15.360 --> 27:18.477
- Can I just say something?
- Yes.

27:19.680 --> 27:24.549
Er... You can never have enough
hats, gloves and shoes.

27:24.760 --> 27:28.150
Right... Thank you very much, Patsy!

27:28.360 --> 27:31.989
Invaluable advice there from
our top professional fashion expert.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.474
- Thanks a lot.
- Now...

27:33.680 --> 27:38.231
Later on, we'll be taking
an in-depth look at acute schizophrenia

27:38.440 --> 27:40.510
from 9:20 to 9:23.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.518
And afterwards,
what else but euthanasia?

27:43.720 --> 27:47.269
We'll talk to some people who pulled
the plug on their elderly mothers,

27:47.480 --> 27:49.710
so you'd better watch out, dear!

27:49.920 --> 27:53.469
Anyway, now over to Ulrika
for the weather. No, sit, sit!

27:54.120 --> 27:55.997
Roll it.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.150
Never have I been so embarrassed
in all my life,

27:59.360 --> 28:02.591
and that is saying something
after living with my mother for 18 years.

28:02.800 --> 28:06.236
- I thought it went very well, dear.
- Did you? Eddy?

28:06.440 --> 28:09.910
Sweetie, you were marvellous.
Darling, you were.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.076
Don't humour her! She stank!

28:12.280 --> 28:14.510
Listen, they offered me a job!

28:14.720 --> 28:16.836
It's only doing the weather.

28:17.680 --> 28:21.116
Mum, have you spoken to Jean-Pierre?
He left a message on the machine.

28:21.320 --> 28:24.278
Sweetie, I don't think I'll be seeing
Jean-Pierre any more.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.438
Pats and I talked about it last night,
and she's right.

28:27.640 --> 28:31.269
With his job and my shop and everything,
it's not really practical, darling.

28:32.920 --> 28:36.230
Get out of this house!
You can at least keep one half of the deal

28:36.440 --> 28:39.637
Listen, sucker! You went on television,
I'm not going anywhere.

28:39.840 --> 28:44.072
- Have you no honour?
- She lost that at 14, dear.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.751
I knew the boy.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.439
Right!

28:48.640 --> 28:53.555
Oh, darling! Success at last,
a teenage temper tantrum.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.716
How did you persuade her to do it?

28:55.920 --> 28:59.799
I fed her some story about my mother
not loving me and her being a tyrant,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.390
me looking after her in old age,
blah, blah, blah...

29:04.440 --> 29:06.749
That's true, isn't it, darling?

29:08.680 --> 29:10.113
Oh, damn!

29:42.160 --> 29:46.039
You can never have enough
hats, gloves and shoes.

29:46.240 --> 29:50.756
- What are you doing tonight, Pats?
- Seeing the publisher, just to be sure.

29:50.960 --> 29:54.714
Darling, even Amanda de Cadenet
would remember the word "accessories".
