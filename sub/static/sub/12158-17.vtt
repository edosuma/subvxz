<i>In front of a live</i>
<i>studio audience.</i>

00:04.839 --> 00:05.971
Hey.

00:05.973 --> 00:07.473
Hey,
dinner's almost ready.

00:07.475 --> 00:08.607
Oh, great. What is it?

00:08.609 --> 00:10.976
My four bacon
and bean soup.

00:10.978 --> 00:14.346
I thought you made
a three-bacon-bean soup.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.716
I found another bacon --
jowl.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.351
Hope you didn't make
too much --

00:19.353 --> 00:22.054
Mandy's at school and Eve is
going out with her boyfriend.

00:22.056 --> 00:24.323
[ horn honks ]

00:24.325 --> 00:25.891
And that would be
the boyfriend.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.226
[ honking continues ]

00:27.228 --> 00:28.494
Better get used to
that noise.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.229
You're gonna be hearing
plenty of that later on.

00:33.166 --> 00:34.233
Hey, honey.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.401
Going out! Be back early!
Love you! Bye!

00:35.403 --> 00:36.668
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Hey, wa-- hey!

00:36.670 --> 00:39.705
[ sighs ] geez.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.708
You know, I have never seen her
move so fast.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.510
Well, maybe he doesn't
stop the car.

00:44.512 --> 00:45.644
She needs
a running start.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.149
-- Captions by vitac --

00:53.887 --> 00:56.355
Hey. What have you been doing
up there?

00:56.357 --> 00:59.558
Honey, only ask questions that
you really want the answers to.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.594
Is Eve home
from her date yet?

01:02.596 --> 01:07.399
Only ask questions you really
want the answers to.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.435
You know what, honey?

01:09.437 --> 01:11.603
I like that Eve
has a real boyfriend.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.505
How come he never
comes to the door?

01:13.507 --> 01:16.175
Just sits out there
in the street, honks his horn.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.610
All the neighbors are mad
at him, even larabee.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.112
Although...
That part I like.

01:21.514 --> 01:23.082
I just got to let this go.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.684
By next week, she'll be
onto something else.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.620
Mm, oh, I think she'll still be
interested in boys.

01:28.622 --> 01:31.523
Yeah, but she'll be doing that
junior rotc skills competition,

01:31.525 --> 01:33.258
Chasing around boys
with a bayonet.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.561
That's what I wish
she would focus less on,

01:35.563 --> 01:37.396
All this junior
rotc stuff.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.199
Yeah. It taught her
discipline, might get
a free ride to college.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.267
But you're right.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.571
She should concentrate more
on video games and weed.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.740
I -- I guess what I really like
about Eve dating

01:48.742 --> 01:51.810
Is it finally gives the two
of us something to bond over.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.046
Is this your way of
telling me that you're
seeing somebody else?

01:54.048 --> 01:57.616
Like I'd ever tell you
about roy.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.251
Ohh!

01:59.253 --> 02:01.987
Oh, just I'm talking about
boyfriends in general.

02:01.989 --> 02:05.257
Now Eve and I, we can have
heart-to-hearts about romance

02:05.259 --> 02:07.159
And what it means
to be a woman.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.660
Yeah, yeah.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.129
Those conversations have gone
well with the other girls,

02:10.131 --> 02:11.730
Haven't they?
Yeah.

02:11.732 --> 02:15.000
Mandy being Mandy and Kris had
a baby in high school.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.602
Oh, come on!

02:16.604 --> 02:18.604
Best-case scenario,
this thing fizzles out.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.772
Even better yet,
the boy breaks her heart

02:20.774 --> 02:22.141
And Eve never dates again.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.942
I'll be up
in a few minutes.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.511
Yeah,
I'm still full from dinner,

02:25.513 --> 02:27.012
So don't expect
too much.

02:27.014 --> 02:30.582
I ate the soup, too,
so you're off the hook.

02:32.418 --> 02:34.620
Oh, hey, Eve.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.188
Good night, mom!
Got a lot of homework to do!

02:36.190 --> 02:37.489
Wait!
H-how was the date?

02:37.491 --> 02:38.590
Don't you want
to talk about it?

02:38.592 --> 02:39.658
Uh, yeah, I do.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.126
I was just gonna
go call cammy.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.495
Oh, come on. Come on.
Get over here. Come on.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.597
We need to catch up.
Just us girls. Come here.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.799
So, I just --
I just want to check in.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.669
I want to know that everything's
going all right.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.437
Yeah. It's fine.
Yeah?

02:52.439 --> 02:53.939
Good. Good.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.675
Oh, you know, I remember
when I first started dating --

02:56.677 --> 02:59.311
Uh, what? Why?
Why are you making a face?

02:59.313 --> 03:02.648
Please don't tell me some story
that ends with you and a guy

03:02.650 --> 03:04.516
In the rumble seat
of his car.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.318
Rumble seat?

03:06.320 --> 03:08.487
Oh, you're very funny.
Yeah, because I'm 100?

03:08.489 --> 03:09.655
Right, okay.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.557
Wait, you know what?

03:11.559 --> 03:14.059
I actually did date a guy
with a rumble seat.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.194
[ laughs ]

03:15.196 --> 03:17.696
Well, on the plus side,
you look good for 100.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.031
No, wait.

03:19.033 --> 03:22.201
He was into antique cars.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.703
And porcelain dolls.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.872
And you let him get away.
Bummer.

03:26.874 --> 03:27.973
Good talk, mom.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.508
Wait, evie, honey.
Listen. I just --

03:29.510 --> 03:30.842
Honey, I just --

03:30.844 --> 03:32.578
I want you to know
that you can tell me anything.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.413
Okay? You're --
you're almost a woman now.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.581
The face. Again.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.916
The face.
Why are you making the face?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.251
Okay, listen.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.520
Mom, there is something
I've been wanting to talk about,

03:41.522 --> 03:43.722
But I just don't want
Mandy and Kristin to know

03:43.724 --> 03:45.691
'cause they'll just tease me
about it.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.659
Don't worry.
Don't you worry, honey.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.828
Consider this
the first of many secrets

03:49.830 --> 03:51.563
You and I will share
together.

04:02.442 --> 04:04.676
Eve just got home
from her date,

04:04.678 --> 04:07.379
And I have got the scoop
on justin.

04:07.381 --> 04:10.716
You know, a lot of people sing
the praises of shakespeare,

04:10.718 --> 04:13.585
But I don't think they ever read
a bob ludlum book.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.787
Don't you want to hear
about Eve?

04:15.789 --> 04:17.522
Not particularly.

04:17.524 --> 04:21.059
Well, she and I just had
a nice little chat,

04:21.061 --> 04:23.862
The kind that only mothers
and daughters have.

04:24.697 --> 04:30.269
I found out some very
interesting informaciÃ³n-e.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.904
Unless matt damon
is playing you or Eve

04:32.906 --> 04:35.807
In a movie about
that conversation, I pass.

04:35.809 --> 04:39.411
Yep, I think that you'll be
happy to know

04:39.413 --> 04:42.614
That their relationship
seems very innocent.

04:42.616 --> 04:46.285
And Eve told me that justin
is super religious.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.619
What do you mean,

04:47.621 --> 04:50.555
Like he goes to church
even on bronco Sunday?

04:50.557 --> 04:52.090
Not only that,

04:52.092 --> 04:55.260
But he signed a "purity pledge"
at his church,

04:55.262 --> 04:57.429
Which means that he won't fool
around until after he's married.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.231
I-I'm aware
of what that means.

04:59.233 --> 05:01.099
Come on, Mike.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.135
I mean, junior rotc,
purity pledge.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.604
This guy,
he's like the perfect boyfriend.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.738
He's no roy.

05:08.574 --> 05:11.510
I appreciate the fact the kid
goes to church on Sunday,

05:11.512 --> 05:12.644
But so did I.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.680
I'm worried about the other
six days of the week.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.747
Come on.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.683
Give him some credit
for the purity pledge.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.652
That's comforting to know
that if he fools around with Eve

05:20.654 --> 05:22.020
That god will smite him.

05:22.022 --> 05:27.526
Feels like a shame to get smited
for being smitten.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.760
[ laughs ]

05:28.762 --> 05:30.595
You know, we're talking about
our kid's virtue here.

05:30.597 --> 05:31.863
Maybe you should take this
more seriously.

05:33.132 --> 05:35.434
What still bugs me is the kid
doesn't come to the door.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.668
I mean,
what's his angle there?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.036
Oh, honey. Geez.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.838
Why do you always think that
everybody's working an angle?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.708
Because I live in the world
of reality,

05:42.710 --> 05:46.278
Not the cotton candy,
moonbeam world of geology.

05:46.280 --> 05:50.148
So, you admit that you were
wrong about captain kangaroo?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.616
Okay!

05:51.618 --> 05:53.018
So the guy
was in the military,

05:53.020 --> 05:54.486
But he never got the rank
of captain!

05:54.488 --> 05:55.821
Oh!

05:55.823 --> 05:58.824
What kind of a teenage boy
takes a purity pledge?

05:58.826 --> 06:00.058
A nice one?

06:00.060 --> 06:02.327
A nice teenage boy?
Yeah.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.663
I've heard of them.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.332
They live with the easter bunny
and sasquatch.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.034
That's who they are.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.535
I don't trust this kid.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.138
He's after our daughter, and I'm
just gonna keep an eye on this.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.807
Well, luckily,
Eve and I have a cool bond now

06:15.809 --> 06:18.176
Where we confide in each other,
so...

06:18.178 --> 06:19.544
We're a great team.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.514
You got that, and I've got
12 loaded shotguns.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.990
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for outdoor man,

06:31.992 --> 06:34.559
Where we say what we mean
and we mean what we say.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.362
That's not always the case
everywhere else, though, is it?

06:37.364 --> 06:38.663
[ chuckling ]
here's a good one.

06:38.665 --> 06:42.100
"if you're happy with your
insurance, you can keep it."

06:42.102 --> 06:43.668
And my old favorite --

06:43.670 --> 06:46.605
"I did not have sexual relations
with that woman."

06:46.607 --> 06:49.408
You hear a politician say,
"I'm not a crook,"

06:49.410 --> 06:51.543
You pretty much know
he's a crook.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.612
Funny thing
about human psychology --

06:53.614 --> 06:56.181
A guilty conscience
leads you to proclaim

06:56.183 --> 06:57.916
The exact opposite of the truth.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.251
Like vladimir putin.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.119
Goes on and on about gay people,

07:01.121 --> 07:03.255
But his hobbies
include wrestling

07:03.257 --> 07:06.691
And riding shirtless on a horse.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.627
Or when a teenage boy
says to a girl

07:08.629 --> 07:10.595
That he's willing
to "take things slow."

07:10.597 --> 07:12.564
What does he mean by "things"?

07:12.566 --> 07:14.199
He's pretty much telling her

07:14.201 --> 07:16.468
He's only got one thing
on his mind.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.303
Which is why we're having
our special, once-a-year,

07:18.305 --> 07:21.106
Fathers-with-teenage-daughters
sale.

07:21.108 --> 07:25.043
All gutting racks
are half-priced.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.947
Because dressing a deer
in front of a teenage boy...

07:28.949 --> 07:33.051
Might just take his mind off
undressing your daughter.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.489
I wish I was going
with you, Eve.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.924
Camping is fun.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.559
Only if it's
on the sidewalk

07:40.561 --> 07:42.627
The night before
the new iphone gets released.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.833
And Kyle's holding my place
while I sleep at home.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.502
Well, this is not about "fun,"
ladies.

07:50.504 --> 07:54.172
We're not twisting dandelions
into friendship bracelets here.

07:54.174 --> 07:57.809
This is the junior rotc
military skills competition.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.011
This is every girl's dream,
okay?

08:00.013 --> 08:02.147
A water-can relay,
log carrying race,

08:02.149 --> 08:04.483
And just when you're about
to cough up a lung,

08:04.485 --> 08:06.952
There's "the gauntlet."

08:06.954 --> 08:11.289
My dream is getting to sleep in
till 8:00 on a Saturday.

08:11.291 --> 08:14.926
Wow, both of your dreams
make me want to cry.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.928
Well, I'll be making
all the boys cry

08:16.930 --> 08:18.263
When I win "top shooter."

08:18.265 --> 08:19.631
Better make room in my duffel

08:19.633 --> 08:21.633
For the trophy
I'm bringing home.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.633
Hold up.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.936
So, there's guys going along
on this little sleepover?

08:24.938 --> 08:28.707
Well, I'm going with an elite
team selected from my squad.

08:28.709 --> 08:32.978
Hmm. Suddenly this is starting
to resemble my dreams.

08:32.980 --> 08:36.515
How does justin feel about you
being out there in the woods

08:36.517 --> 08:39.651
Running around
with all those muscular hotties

08:39.653 --> 08:41.286
In tight-fitting uniforms?

08:43.189 --> 08:45.390
Well, the uniforms
are regulation --

08:45.392 --> 08:48.493
Shh.
My dreams, my uniforms.

08:48.495 --> 08:51.730
Okay, well,
justin will be there, too.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.669
Ohhhhh.

08:57.671 --> 09:02.807
Now I get
what's going on here.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.644
That would be a first.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.646
Your boyfriend
is going with you?

09:07.648 --> 09:09.681
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Very nice.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.082
A little mood lighting.

09:12.685 --> 09:15.253
A little romantic dinner.

09:16.722 --> 09:22.260
A little sleeping bag for two
under the stars.

09:22.262 --> 09:27.933
And you'll just junior rot-see
what happens.

09:27.935 --> 09:31.036
Nothing
is going to happen!

09:31.038 --> 09:33.905
Okay, it better not,
but, uh, just in case,

09:33.907 --> 09:35.674
I -- I want to make sure

09:35.676 --> 09:38.610
This isn't the only raincoat
you're packing.

09:38.612 --> 09:41.680
Why would I need more than one
raincoat, guys?

09:43.849 --> 09:46.017
No.
Um, yeah.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.520
Do mom and dad know
about justin?

09:48.522 --> 09:50.589
Well, they know he's
in junior rotc with me.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.457
And they signed off
on this weekend?

09:52.459 --> 09:54.593
They signed my permission slip
months ago.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.094
Before you started
dating him.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.729
Okay, yeah,
but it's no big deal,

09:57.731 --> 09:59.631
Because we're just going
as teammates this weekend.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.733
And he better not drop
the water can in the relay,

10:01.735 --> 10:04.369
'cause he'll be taking
his sister to prom.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.369
Wait.

10:05.371 --> 10:08.239
You need to explain all this
to mom and dad before you go.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.474
Explain what to us?

10:09.476 --> 10:11.977
Nothing.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.979
Eve, what's, uh --
what's going on?

10:13.981 --> 10:15.280
Uh, honey, you know --

10:15.282 --> 10:17.582
Uh, you know you can tell me
anything, right?

10:17.584 --> 10:19.384
I know.
It's -- it's just drama.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.820
I mean, I hate living in a house
with a bunch of girls.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.822
Yeah,
I know the feeling.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.257
Take a break.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.626
Come on in the den.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.595
Do what I do -- bitch about the
democrats and clean shotguns.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.264
What is it?

10:33.266 --> 10:35.600
Eve, they're gonna find out
eventually.

10:35.602 --> 10:38.670
Boy, there's words
every parent loves to hear.

10:38.672 --> 10:39.904
What's going on?

10:39.906 --> 10:41.306
I-it's nothing.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.641
Justin made the team,

10:42.643 --> 10:45.977
And he's going on
the camping trip this weekend.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.646
Everybody happy now?

10:47.648 --> 10:49.614
Oh, I've been happier.

10:49.616 --> 10:53.818
Evie, honey, this, uh --
this changes things a lot.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.420
Why?
Well --

10:55.422 --> 10:56.488
Because we've never met
this kid.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.488
He won't even come
to the front door.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.923
No way I'm letting you go away
for the weekend with him!

10:58.925 --> 10:59.958
No. No. No.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.326
What?! T-that's insane!

11:01.328 --> 11:03.528
I've been training for a year.
I have to go.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.263
Yeah, but you're not.
I'm sorry.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.865
I can't believe you guys
don't trust me.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.467
Well, I can't believe you didn't
trust me enough to tell me.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.635
I thought we had
a cool bond.

11:10.637 --> 11:14.172
You're not old enough
to go on a sleepover

11:14.174 --> 11:16.074
With mr. Purity pledge.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.612
You told him?

11:20.614 --> 11:22.847
Yeah,
and I'm not buying it.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.685
A purity pledge is one step
below a pinky swear.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.654
I can't believe
I was stupid enough

11:29.656 --> 11:32.123
To tell you anything,
mom!

11:32.125 --> 11:33.525
[ sighs ]

11:33.527 --> 11:35.960
Wow, you really violated
her trust.

11:45.638 --> 11:46.671
[ knock on door ]

11:46.673 --> 11:48.573
Go away.

11:50.342 --> 11:52.577
Thanks a lot for telling
mom and dad about justin.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.046
It would have been much worse
if they found out after.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.882
How about my plan
where they never find out?

11:57.884 --> 11:59.984
How about
we give that a try?

11:59.986 --> 12:02.187
[ chuckling ] oh, wait.
It's too late.

12:02.189 --> 12:06.024
Look, I know you're really mad
at mom and dad right now --

12:06.026 --> 12:09.327
And you --
let's not forget you.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.830
You know we're all just looking
out for your best interests.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.998
So, it's in my best interest
to be punished

12:14.000 --> 12:16.167
Because you and Mandy
are both giant tramps

12:16.169 --> 12:17.435
Who slept around?

12:17.437 --> 12:18.536
[ scoffs ]

12:18.538 --> 12:20.672
I never slept around, okay?

12:20.674 --> 12:22.373
I -- I had a kid.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.609
And I haven't slept since.

12:24.611 --> 12:25.609
But you're right.

12:25.611 --> 12:29.681
I -- I made some mistakes, which
is why I want you to be safe.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.116
So justin will be
90 miles away

12:31.118 --> 12:33.184
While I'm locked up in my room
all weekend.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.185
Safe enough for you?

12:34.187 --> 12:36.354
You know [sighs]
if I were you --

12:36.356 --> 12:39.691
You're not me!
Okay?!

12:39.693 --> 12:41.259
If you were going
this weekend,

12:41.261 --> 12:42.527
It would be to hook up
with your boyfriend.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.230
But I was going
because I trained for a year

12:45.232 --> 12:47.599
And I wanted to kick
the other squads' ass!

12:47.601 --> 12:50.635
So, you don't even care
that justin is gonna be there?

12:50.637 --> 12:54.739
No, I'm actually kind of annoyed
that he's going.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.575
He's not that good.

12:57.577 --> 13:01.412
And he'll just embarrass me
in front of the guys.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.048
He made the team,
like, two days ago

13:04.050 --> 13:06.484
Because some other kid
got hurt...

13:06.486 --> 13:09.154
When he tripped...

13:09.156 --> 13:10.989
Over justin.

13:10.991 --> 13:14.392
Wait, so, all of this
wasn't just an excuse

13:14.394 --> 13:17.729
For you guys to have
some alone time together?

13:17.731 --> 13:18.997
Hello!

13:18.999 --> 13:20.598
Both of our parents work.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.667
I get out of school
at 3:00.

13:22.669 --> 13:25.537
If we wanted to, we could have
had two kids and a cat by now.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.073
Wow.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.909
I -- I'm sorry.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.510
I guess this really <i>is</i>
<i>my fault.</i>

13:32.512 --> 13:34.145
I just, you know,
I assumed

13:34.147 --> 13:36.314
That you were doing
what I would have done.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.817
Why would I ever do that?

13:38.819 --> 13:41.119
When I talk about you
to my friends,

13:41.121 --> 13:43.721
I always call you
"the cautionary tale."

13:48.494 --> 13:50.428
Eve worked so hard
for this.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.697
I hated having to
take it away from her.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.666
Well, you shouldn't have
let it happen.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.267
We both signed
that permission slip

13:56.269 --> 13:58.436
Before we knew that they were
seeing each other.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.504
But then you forgot it.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.972
You forgot about it, too.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.340
Because I have a job.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.775
So do I.

14:03.777 --> 14:06.511
Let's not split hairs
over whose job is more demanding

14:06.513 --> 14:07.645
And who's a geologist.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.113
Oh, okay.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.481
Mom. Dad.

14:10.483 --> 14:11.783
Uh, I just had a nice talk
with Eve.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.218
You did?
Is she still mad
at your mom?

14:13.220 --> 14:14.352
'cause that's
understandable.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.954
Shh!

14:15.956 --> 14:17.355
Listen, I don't think
you have to worry

14:17.357 --> 14:18.556
About letting her go
on this trip.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.524
Because she's not going.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.359
Keep up
with the current events!

14:21.361 --> 14:22.627
Okay, that's a mistake.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.728
Eve shouldn't have to pay

14:23.730 --> 14:26.397
For the stuff that I did
in high school, or Mandy.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.233
Eve's a better kid
than either of us were.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.801
We would have been
out that bedroom window

14:29.803 --> 14:30.902
A half an hour ago.

14:30.904 --> 14:34.405
Yeah. That was kind of
your go-to move.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.405
But it isn't Eve's,

14:35.407 --> 14:38.710
And -- and she's the best
climber of the three of us.

14:38.712 --> 14:42.013
That's because she's got those
weird little monkey hands.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.982
Eve said
that she wasn't ready

14:43.984 --> 14:46.351
To do anything physical
with justin,

14:46.353 --> 14:48.419
And I have to say
I believe her.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.687
She shared all that
with you?

14:49.689 --> 14:51.723
I mean, you were only up there
for like two minutes. How?

14:51.725 --> 14:54.192
Vanessa, consider it
a blessing --

14:54.194 --> 14:55.493
Less for you to blab.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.161
But wait.
She -- she misled us.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.230
All this time, she knew
her boyfriend was going,

14:59.232 --> 15:00.331
And she kept it from us?

15:00.333 --> 15:01.499
No, no, no.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.368
She just found out
justin was going.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.535
She --
she didn't mislead you.

15:04.537 --> 15:07.505
Really, I -- I think you guys
should reconsider.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.007
Love you.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.742
Oh. Honey,
are we making a mistake?

15:10.744 --> 15:12.877
I mean, all this time,
we've been focusing

15:12.879 --> 15:14.612
On whether we could trust
this boy,

15:14.614 --> 15:16.681
And we forgot
that we <i>can</i> trust Eve.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.950
This is your fault.
What?!

15:18.952 --> 15:20.585
You gave me bad intel.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.924
You don't have
the cool relationship with Eve

15:25.926 --> 15:28.693
That you think you do.

15:28.695 --> 15:29.693
Where are you going?

15:29.695 --> 15:31.062
To tell Eve
she can go to fort carson.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.031
No, honey. Wait. Wait.
No, wait. Listen. Listen.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.465
I think Eve's gonna be really
thrilled to hear this and...

15:34.467 --> 15:35.700
I know. I know.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.369
...I think it should come
from her mother.

15:43.242 --> 15:45.610
Eve, honey?

15:45.612 --> 15:47.078
Hey.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.980
What?

15:48.982 --> 15:50.214
Oh, she's gone!

15:50.216 --> 15:52.417
And she --
she took her bag!

15:52.419 --> 15:53.551
[ gasps ] oh, no!

15:53.553 --> 15:55.987
She followed her sisters
out the window.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.889
Damn monkey hands.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.334
Evie, honey, please call.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.768
We just want to know
that you're okay.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.971
We're not mad at you.
You're not in trouble.

16:12.973 --> 16:16.107
She's the smart one.
She's not gonna fall for that.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.576
Do you think we drove her
to this by not trusting her?

16:18.578 --> 16:21.012
Or -- or -- or was she playing
us the whole time?

16:21.014 --> 16:23.114
She's been two steps ahead of us
the whole time.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.516
It's like I'm treadstone,
and I want to be Jason bourne.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.318
Ohh.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.619
What's up, gloomy gusses?

16:28.621 --> 16:31.856
Did one of your political guys
get in trouble

16:31.858 --> 16:34.158
For, uh,
waterboarding again?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.927
Mandy, not now.

16:35.929 --> 16:38.129
I never understood
why that was such a big deal.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.498
'cause I went waterboarding
that one time in california.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.534
It was, like, so much fun!

16:43.536 --> 16:46.704
Listen, Eve snuck out to go
on her junior rotc weekend

16:46.706 --> 16:49.107
Even though we told her
that she couldn't go.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.342
Wow.
Totally pulling a Mandy.

16:51.344 --> 16:56.014
I got to say
I'm kind of proud.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.383
You're proud of setting
a bad example for your sister?

16:58.385 --> 16:59.951
I'm not, like,
"proud" proud.

16:59.953 --> 17:02.286
I mean, like, you know,
my gay pride proud,

17:02.288 --> 17:04.389
Like, where I'm walking
past the parade.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.357
And I'm like, "hey!
[ clicks tongue ]

17:06.359 --> 17:07.959
"good for you.
That's awesome.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.560
[ gasps ]
ooh, a pretzel cart."

17:09.562 --> 17:11.496
Are you gonna go get her?

17:11.498 --> 17:12.563
Yeah.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.798
You want me to come with you?
No, no.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.133
You know what you should do?

17:15.135 --> 17:17.001
Go cut down that tree
outside her window.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.736
Oh.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.676
[ shovel scrapes ]

17:25.678 --> 17:27.812

17:37.590 --> 17:38.588
Hey, there.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.658
I don't think that hole's
big enough for two.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.326
Where's your boyfriend?

17:42.328 --> 17:44.996
In the infirmary.
[ sighs ]

17:44.998 --> 17:47.565
He sprained his ankle...

17:47.567 --> 17:50.601
Putting up his tent.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.170
There's officer material.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.572
Why did you think
it was okay to leave

17:54.574 --> 17:56.207
When your mom and I said
you couldn't?

17:56.209 --> 17:57.375
I had to come.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.911
We have a real shot
at winning this weekend,

17:59.913 --> 18:01.512
And they won't without me.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.347
Right. So you snuck away
with your boyfriend?

18:03.349 --> 18:05.016
I didn't sneak away
with my boyfriend.

18:05.018 --> 18:06.084
How'd you get here?

18:06.086 --> 18:07.485
My boyfriend.

18:09.688 --> 18:12.056
But we've barely
seen each other since,

18:12.058 --> 18:14.792
And we've been doing
separate drills all day.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.761
And [sighs]
then he got hurt.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.062
And then I laughed.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.631
And then he got
the other kind of hurt.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.933
I don't need
to hear this stuff.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.202
I just want you to pack up
your gear and get in the truck.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.470
Let's go.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.305
I'm not leaving, dad.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.639
What do you mean,
you're not leaving?

18:28.641 --> 18:30.208
What the hell's the matter
with you?!

18:30.210 --> 18:31.275
What's the matter
with you?!

18:31.277 --> 18:32.643
Since when did you stop
trusting me?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.278
I gave you an order,
and you defied it.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.780
That's breaking
the chain of command.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.049
You above everybody should know
that means something.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.917
Yes, sir.

18:39.919 --> 18:43.488
You can't just obey orders
that you agree with.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.491
A soldier has to submit
to authority.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.627
Even when that authority might
have misjudged the situation

18:49.629 --> 18:51.095
And you think
they're wrong?

18:51.097 --> 18:54.499
Yes.

18:54.501 --> 18:58.436
So, you're admitting that you
misjudged the situation?

18:58.438 --> 19:01.472
A commander is only as good
as his intel.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.442
Now, are you gonna March
to this truck like a soldier,

19:04.444 --> 19:06.978
Or do I got to carry you
like a crying little girl?

19:06.980 --> 19:09.580
I'll go like a soldier.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.482
Go tell your commander
what's going on here.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.817
Okay. Yes, sir.
Hustle up!

19:12.819 --> 19:14.051
Yes, sir.

19:18.590 --> 19:22.994
That's a latrine right there.

19:22.996 --> 19:26.564
Kind of sorry I made
that pit stop before I got here.

19:29.434 --> 19:33.871
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.640
Perfect depth, nice edges.

19:35.642 --> 19:39.977
It's a shame what those kids are
gonna do to this after a while.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.713
Did you talk
to your commander?

19:42.715 --> 19:43.881
Yeah.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.384
He's real disappointed,
but I couldn't tell

19:46.386 --> 19:48.719
If it was because I'm
supposed to run anchor

19:48.721 --> 19:49.987
In the relay tomorrow

19:49.989 --> 19:53.891
Or his life didn't turn out
the way he'd hoped.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.227
Is that yours?

19:56.229 --> 19:58.563
Yeah.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.498
I won "top shooter."

20:00.500 --> 20:03.134
Wasn't even close.

20:03.136 --> 20:07.405
Dad, I'm really sorry
that I let you down.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.740
I just didn't want
to let down my squad,

20:09.742 --> 20:11.509
And it's important
that a soldier

20:11.511 --> 20:12.910
Can count on his brothers.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.979
And sisters.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.848
Yeah.

20:17.850 --> 20:21.886
And there's some more
bad news.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.187
I -- driving up here,

20:23.189 --> 20:25.489
I think I was basically
driving on fumes.

20:25.491 --> 20:28.059
I don't think I have
enough gas to get back.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.563
Seriously?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.232
Yeah.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.101
I -- I can just send someone
down in the morning.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.204
I'll stay here, and I'll sleep
in the truck tonight.

20:40.206 --> 20:43.541
So, we're stuck here
until tomorrow.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.076
Yes.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.245
As long as we're here
and staying,

20:47.247 --> 20:49.947
You might as well just hang out
with your squad

20:49.949 --> 20:51.882
And, you know,
do your drills.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.418
Yep, might as well.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.554
And since I'm
staying the night,

20:56.556 --> 20:58.856
I can watch you
do the relay tomorrow.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.759
All I'll be here tonight,
just hanging out.

21:01.761 --> 21:05.496
You never know where I'm gonna
be, watching everything.

21:12.537 --> 21:16.607
Thanks, dad.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.542
Is this justin
a good guy?

21:18.544 --> 21:19.577
He's okay.

21:19.579 --> 21:22.546
I'm pretty sure
I'm the best thing

21:22.548 --> 21:25.249
That's ever happened
to him.

21:25.251 --> 21:28.653
Something he and I
might have in common.
