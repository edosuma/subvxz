WEBVTT

00:08.353 --> 00:10.867
Go on! Kill him!

00:16.193 --> 00:18.263
Get him, Tommy!

00:20.793 --> 00:22.306
Go! Yes!

00:23.833 --> 00:25.824
No!

00:28.673 --> 00:30.106
No!

00:35.593 --> 00:37.709
You bum!

00:37.793 --> 00:40.102
You ball-of-lard bum!

00:45.553 --> 00:48.386
And now it's time
for the main event of the evening.

00:50.473 --> 00:53.067
Grand prize - 5,000 bucks!

00:57.313 --> 01:03.070
First, the champion.
With a record of 45 wins and no losses,

01:03.153 --> 01:08.750
standing six foot ten,
and weighing in at 260 pounds,

01:08.833 --> 01:11.552
Sam "The Mangler" Miller.

01:14.833 --> 01:16.949
And now, the challenger.

01:17.033 --> 01:21.788
Undefeated in his three times in the ring,
he hails from parts unknown.

01:22.233 --> 01:27.990
Standing six feet tall,
weighing in at a mean 178 pounds,

01:28.433 --> 01:30.424
Monty Cora!

01:32.633 --> 01:35.272
$300 on the good-Iookin' one.

01:37.673 --> 01:40.631
I'm gonna tear your head off
and stuff it up your ass.

01:40.953 --> 01:43.626
Shouldn't we shake hands first?

01:48.473 --> 01:52.352
- I'll take that as a no.
- He jumped the bell!

01:52.433 --> 01:54.742
Go get him, tiger. Come on!

02:28.033 --> 02:30.467
- What the hell are you?
- Better.

02:36.353 --> 02:38.344
That's the ticket!

02:39.793 --> 02:41.784
That's what I like to see.

02:43.353 --> 02:45.628
The champion!

02:51.433 --> 02:55.187
- What do you mean, this is your last fight?
- I'm done.

02:55.273 --> 02:57.787
- I'm gonna retire undefeated.
- Retire?

02:57.873 --> 03:01.468
They love you out there. We've done twice
the business since you showed up.

03:01.553 --> 03:06.752
Look, Annie, as much as I enjoy beating
people up, I've got bigger plans for my life.

03:06.833 --> 03:09.222
And this is gonna help me get started.

03:11.953 --> 03:15.229
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

03:23.193 --> 03:25.263
What do you guys want?

03:38.633 --> 03:40.828
Take him out the back.

03:42.073 --> 03:44.953
They designed her to be the perfect soldier.
A human weapon.

03:44.953 --> 03:46.784
They designed her to be the perfect soldier.
A human weapon.

03:46.873 --> 03:48.864
Then she escaped.

03:48.953 --> 03:53.231
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

03:53.313 --> 03:55.702
she is haunted by her past.

03:55.793 --> 04:00.662
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

04:38.673 --> 04:44.384
So, the mayor of our fair city tells the cops
somebody ripped off his town car last night.

04:44.473 --> 04:46.748
It wasn't me, I swear.

04:46.833 --> 04:50.064
They found it over in Sector Four
with 500 hits of X in the trunk.

04:50.153 --> 04:51.950
A drug dealer stole it?

04:52.033 --> 04:54.672
No. The drug dealer got it
from a hooker he pimps.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.426
The hooker got it from His Honour, as a gift.

04:57.513 --> 05:00.232
The mayor sobered up the next day,
forgot all about it.

05:00.313 --> 05:03.623
Except she had the signed pink slip.
Said she'd tell the press

05:03.713 --> 05:08.468
unless he dropped the charges against her
boyfriend, and she'd like to keep the car.

05:09.873 --> 05:14.230
- Where'd you hear this touching story?
- I have my sources.

05:14.313 --> 05:16.827
- Stir that for me, will you?
- All right.

05:16.913 --> 05:20.349
So this is what the Eyes Only informant net
has been reduced to, huh?

05:20.433 --> 05:24.312
Trading information about
crooked politicians' sex lives?

05:24.393 --> 05:28.671
Well, you can only fight corruption
and injustice so many hours in the day.

05:29.073 --> 05:34.227
- Every once in a while, you gotta kick back.
- This is great.

05:34.313 --> 05:36.304
Thanks. It's a family...

05:39.353 --> 05:41.708
I can't believe I just did that.

05:41.793 --> 05:45.229
It's OK. If you turn up the flame,
heat kills pretty much anything.

05:45.313 --> 05:46.193
Salmonella, maybe. But not a Frankenstein
virus targeted specifically to your DNA.

05:46.193 --> 05:49.822
Salmonella, maybe. But not a Frankenstein
virus targeted specifically to your DNA.

05:49.913 --> 05:53.986
It's bad enough they made it so we can't
touch. Now we can't even have dinner.

05:54.073 --> 05:57.588
- You can still have some.
- I'm gonna go.

05:57.673 --> 06:02.508
Wait. We have bread, we have salad.
I'm sure I can rustle something else up.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.903
Please?

06:05.993 --> 06:07.984
I can't do this.

06:09.193 --> 06:11.229
It's too hard.

06:12.713 --> 06:14.783
Max!

06:16.353 --> 06:18.344
My jacket.

07:03.073 --> 07:04.984
Good kitty!

07:05.073 --> 07:07.029
- Hot stuff!
- Beautiful!

07:08.033 --> 07:10.228
Baby, do me.

07:12.713 --> 07:14.704
Show Daddy what you've got.

07:16.793 --> 07:18.863
That's nice.

07:18.953 --> 07:21.865
Let's get some shots of you
vacuuming the sofa.

07:21.953 --> 07:23.022
OK.

07:29.993 --> 07:35.021
- What are you turning that on for?
- I might as well get it done.

07:38.393 --> 07:41.032
What was that?

07:42.073 --> 07:44.223
- There's something outside.
- Relax, baby.

07:44.313 --> 07:46.463
There's nobody here but me and you.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.948
Where is he?

07:51.553 --> 07:53.908
Oh, mother.

07:53.993 --> 07:56.029
- Who are you?
- Call the police.

08:02.433 --> 08:07.507
You've reached Seattle Emergency. No one's
available to take your call right now...

08:07.593 --> 08:09.390
Where is he?

08:09.473 --> 08:12.624
Please continue to hold.

08:19.873 --> 08:22.148
What the hell was that thing?

08:25.153 --> 08:26.825
Good question.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.669
- Hello?
- It's Lydecker.

08:37.313 --> 08:40.828
- I had a feeling I'd hear from you again.
- Don't sound so happy about it.

08:40.913 --> 08:43.347
If you're calling
to follow up our conversation,

08:43.433 --> 08:46.982
- Max made it back fine.
- She always does.

08:47.073 --> 08:50.702
High praise from a man who spent
the last ten years hunting her down.

08:50.793 --> 08:52.863
Those days are over now.

08:52.953 --> 08:55.626
Tell Max I'll be in touch soon.
I'm working on a lead.

08:55.713 --> 08:59.592
No. I'm done taking down
these cryptic messages for you.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.141
I wanna know what's going on.

09:03.753 --> 09:07.541
They did a DNA assay on Max
when she was back in Manticore.

09:07.873 --> 09:11.183
There's something unusual
about her genetic make-up.

09:11.273 --> 09:14.151
Something even I didn't know about.

09:14.233 --> 09:16.224
- What does it mean?
- I don't know yet.

09:16.993 --> 09:21.271
Renfro must have thought it important.
I found the test results in her briefcase.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.992
Along with an employee ID

09:24.073 --> 09:29.466
from a company that,
as far as I can tell, doesn't exist.

09:29.553 --> 09:32.272
- Tell Max I'm lookin' into it.
- I'll pass it on.

09:32.353 --> 09:34.708
- Thanks. I appreciate your help.
- Yeah?

09:34.793 --> 09:37.148
Then maybe you can
help me with something.

09:38.753 --> 09:40.027
I'm listening.

09:45.913 --> 09:49.383
Lydecker said you worked
as a lab tech at Manticore?

09:49.473 --> 09:52.033
I spliced your DNA into the virus substrate.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.673
Keep braggin' about it,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

09:54.753 --> 09:59.429
You want my help or not? Cos when I scrape
enough cash together, I'm leavin' town.

09:59.513 --> 10:03.222
They're tryin' to kill me
and anyone else who worked there.

10:03.313 --> 10:05.349
- How much?
- Ten grand.

10:06.193 --> 10:09.265
You've gotta be kidding me.

10:13.033 --> 10:15.593
- Where'd you get that?
- I sold some stuff.

10:15.673 --> 10:17.664
Half now, half when you deliver.

10:19.353 --> 10:21.548
Gonna need a blood sample.

10:28.393 --> 10:30.907
Give me two days
to figure out how to kill this virus

10:30.993 --> 10:34.065
and then you two lovebirds
can get back to suckin' face.

10:47.033 --> 10:48.022
What's up?

10:48.113 --> 10:52.026
Logan found an ex-Manticore tech
thinks he can cure the virus.

10:52.113 --> 10:54.547
When are you gonna
let your face in on the good news?

10:54.633 --> 11:00.981
I don't know. I'm startin' to think things
between me and Logan are never going...

11:01.073 --> 11:03.029
Hey, Max.

11:03.113 --> 11:05.104
I didn't know you kicked it here.

11:05.193 --> 11:07.787
Yeah. I'm practically a regular.

11:08.673 --> 11:11.141
- Original Cindy, Asha.
- Hi.

11:11.233 --> 11:14.384
Max, we're havin' a disagreement at the table.

11:14.473 --> 11:18.261
Maybe you and
your fine new friend here can referee?

11:18.633 --> 11:22.148
- Sure, Sketch. Break it down.
- The guys are dissin' on Eyes Only.

11:22.233 --> 11:27.512
Sayin' that Manticore place that burned down
and let out the freaks was a VA hospital.

11:27.593 --> 11:29.868
Come defend the great man's honour.

11:31.873 --> 11:35.912
- I try and stay out of that political stuff.
- Yeah, me too.

11:36.393 --> 11:39.305
It says right here
they're out there, lookin' to feed.

11:39.393 --> 11:42.032
One too many forties,
now he's seein' zombies.

11:42.113 --> 11:44.991
Not zombies. Creatures made in labs.

11:45.073 --> 11:47.826
Some look just like us. Some don't.

11:47.913 --> 11:50.552
They got bar-code transmitters
on their necks,

11:50.633 --> 11:53.943
so they can beam information about us
to the main headquarters.

11:54.273 --> 11:58.824
Wigga, you faded. News said it was
some terrorist group called SW1

11:58.913 --> 12:02.952
that burned the place down
and killed a bunch of vets, period point blank.

12:03.033 --> 12:06.946
It's the S1W and they would
never do anything like that.

12:07.793 --> 12:11.991
But, I mean, come on. You can't believe
anything in the government news, right?

12:12.073 --> 12:16.351
If I was making creatures in a lab,
I'd make 'em look just like you.

12:17.993 --> 12:20.427
Really? That's really sweet.

12:20.513 --> 12:22.231
Leave her alone, fool.

12:22.313 --> 12:27.546
And stop readin' this trash, before you ruin
what's left of your brain cells.

12:28.553 --> 12:30.589
I gotta go.

12:31.153 --> 12:33.144
Max!

12:33.993 --> 12:36.143
What's the matter?

12:39.073 --> 12:41.064
Somebody you know, sugar?

12:41.153 --> 12:44.589
His name's Joshua. He helped me
escape from Manticore. This is bad.

12:44.673 --> 12:48.143
- Nobody believes this stuff anyway.
- Not yet.

12:58.233 --> 13:01.430
That was a very impressive display last night.

13:02.793 --> 13:05.990
- It's so nice to have fans.
- Tell me, 494.

13:07.513 --> 13:10.311
Have you been in contact with this girl?

13:11.233 --> 13:14.145
We know that you were
breeding partners back at Manticore.

13:14.233 --> 13:16.508
It was just a summer fling.

13:17.553 --> 13:19.703
What about any other transgenics?

13:20.273 --> 13:23.583
I make it a point not
to fraternise with automatons.

13:23.673 --> 13:25.709
They slow me down.

13:25.793 --> 13:28.944
So what are you? FBI? NSA?

13:29.993 --> 13:34.430
Let's just say that I've been sent to wipe out
all evidence that Manticore ever existed

13:34.513 --> 13:37.027
and leave it at that.

13:38.753 --> 13:42.792
Make sure you take a DNA sample
before you dispose of the body.

13:43.673 --> 13:45.868
Wait! Killing me won't solve your problem.

13:45.953 --> 13:51.346
- You're right. I have to take out all of you.
- You gotta find 'em first. I can help.

13:52.713 --> 13:54.908
Is that a fact?

13:57.633 --> 14:01.990
Who better to hunt transgenics
than another transgenic?

14:03.193 --> 14:07.709
You expect me to believe
that you would turn against your own kind?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.703
Try me.

14:27.393 --> 14:29.384
What was that?

14:29.993 --> 14:33.190
Just a little something
to make sure that you don't run off on me,

14:33.273 --> 14:36.822
as you were undoubtedly planning to do.

14:37.473 --> 14:39.509
Micro-explosive.

14:41.833 --> 14:44.825
Not much punch to it really, but enough,

14:44.913 --> 14:47.825
considering it's lodged
against your brainstem.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.906
If it goes off
you will never know what hit you.

14:52.273 --> 14:55.549
Locate and kill three transgenics,
and I'll disarm it.

14:58.233 --> 15:02.226
- How long do I have?
- The explosive will detonate in 24 hours.

15:03.313 --> 15:08.387
- A day?
- Do it, I have three less freaks to worry about.

15:08.473 --> 15:10.513
You don't, your head explodes.

15:10.513 --> 15:11.070
You don't, your head explodes.

15:18.753 --> 15:20.709
Time's a-wastin'.

15:22.913 --> 15:25.666
I'd get started if I were you.

15:32.433 --> 15:34.583
One more thing.

15:34.673 --> 15:38.905
Bring back their bar codes. Proof of purchase.

15:40.793 --> 15:42.784
Happy hunting.

15:47.713 --> 15:51.262
This could prove to be
a very interesting little experiment.

15:51.353 --> 15:53.423
Think he's lying about not knowing her?

15:53.513 --> 15:56.346
Always assume they're lying.
You'll live longer.

15:56.433 --> 16:00.346
We could get lucky. He brings in
her bar code, we scrape it for DNA.

16:00.713 --> 16:02.704
Answer a lot of questions.

16:02.793 --> 16:05.227
Either way, I win.

16:11.793 --> 16:13.784
- Looks pretty dangerous.
- He's not.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.023
Don't judge him because of the way he looks.

16:16.113 --> 16:20.391
Well, fine. But apparently he is breaking
into people's houses. Any idea why?

16:20.793 --> 16:24.263
Maybe he's looking for a place
to sleep or something to eat.

16:24.353 --> 16:26.947
I have to get to him
before something bad happens.

16:27.033 --> 16:31.424
I'll see if I can get ahold of those police
reports, find the addresses on the break-ins.

16:31.513 --> 16:35.347
They're probably all in the same area,
near wherever he's hiding.

16:35.433 --> 16:39.187
- Should narrow things down, at least.
- I can boot up my police scanner.

16:39.273 --> 16:42.071
Monitor the calls.
If he shows up somewhere else,

16:42.153 --> 16:44.348
maybe you can get to him
before the cops do.

16:44.433 --> 16:46.424
Thanks.

16:47.953 --> 16:50.228
He's so not ready to be out there in the world.

16:50.313 --> 16:53.988
I put him there.
If something happens it'd be my fault.

16:54.353 --> 16:56.708
Don't be so hard on yourself, Max.

16:56.793 --> 16:59.944
You put me out in the world, and I'm lovin' it.

17:00.033 --> 17:02.911
- Don't you people ever knock?
- What are you doing here?

17:02.993 --> 17:05.382
Lookin' for you.

17:05.992 --> 17:10.942
Fact is, I need to be with my own kind. I was
wondering if you hooked up with any others.

17:11.032 --> 17:15.026
- You lookin' to start a support group?
- Just bored, really.

17:15.113 --> 17:18.469
- Ordinary people are so ordinary. No offence.
- I'll set up a play date.

17:18.553 --> 17:20.703
I'm in the middle of something.

17:21.272 --> 17:23.468
Isn't this your dog-boy pal?

17:24.713 --> 17:28.831
Looks like he's gotten into quite a jam.
Guess you'll swoop in and save the day?

17:28.913 --> 17:31.552
- I was thinkin' about it.
- You're gonna need a hand.

17:31.633 --> 17:35.467
- She's got two of her own. Thanks.
- This affects me too, you know.

17:35.553 --> 17:39.341
When people catch wind of stuff like this,
it's exposure for all of us.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.505
Today the tabloids,
tomorrow the nightly news.

17:45.993 --> 17:49.622
Logan's tracking down a few leads.
Thought I'd check out Terminal City.

17:49.713 --> 17:51.943
- Max.
- I'd head there if I wanted to lay low.

17:52.033 --> 17:55.309
- Why? What's Terminal City?
- Come on. I'll show you.

18:02.353 --> 18:05.789
- What's the deal with this place?
- Used to be a bunch of biotech labs,

18:05.873 --> 18:09.991
and then when the Pulse hit, the power
went down, a few of them lost containment.

18:10.073 --> 18:13.304
- Some pretty nasty stuff got out.
- Kinda like you and me, huh?

18:13.393 --> 18:17.181
City couldn't afford to clean up the mess,
so they just sealed off the area.

18:17.273 --> 18:21.391
Nobody goes out here unless they got
nowhere else to go and nothing to lose.

18:21.473 --> 18:25.671
Lucky thing they made us immune
to your common bio-warfare agents.

18:25.753 --> 18:29.951
Speaking of bio-agents,
how's that thingy with you and Logan?

18:30.873 --> 18:31.862
Just askin'.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.784
Got a light?

20:22.353 --> 20:24.992
- You two lost?
- We're looking for someone.

20:25.073 --> 20:28.383
- Maybe you've seen him around.
- What's he look like?

20:28.473 --> 20:32.148
Really tall, wears an army jacket, kind of...

20:32.233 --> 20:35.862
Hairy. Lots of growling, some barking...

20:35.953 --> 20:38.148
- Hush, Bongo.
- Like that.

20:38.513 --> 20:41.505
- Sorry.
- Saw a lizard guy the other day, though.

20:41.873 --> 20:44.228
- Remember, Bill? I told ya...
- You were drunk.

20:44.313 --> 20:49.307
- Maybe he's a friend of yours too.
- No, but we wouldn't mind talking to him.

20:49.393 --> 20:51.748
Check the sewer. That's where he went.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.301
Along with his panther lady friend.

20:54.393 --> 20:56.384
Thanks.

21:03.473 --> 21:07.307
This is hands down the most
disgusting sewer I've ever been in.

21:07.393 --> 21:09.953
What's that?

21:10.033 --> 21:12.228
It's a dog.

21:12.993 --> 21:15.268
- Something big took it out.
- Not Joshua.

21:15.353 --> 21:18.106
He wouldn't turn against his own kind?

21:20.473 --> 21:23.306
It's Logan. I have to get to a payphone.

21:23.393 --> 21:26.908
Wait, wait, wait.
Come into the 21st century, would you?

21:30.313 --> 21:33.703
- Logan, it's me.
- I just hung up with my police contact.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.261
He found the address
of Joshua's last break-in.

21:36.353 --> 21:38.628
- Where was it?
- Across town in Sector Six.

21:38.713 --> 21:42.183
542 McCallister. Name's Sandeman.

21:42.913 --> 21:43.902
Sandeman?

21:44.113 --> 21:46.343
Father - Sandeman.

21:46.553 --> 21:47.747
He made us all.

21:47.953 --> 21:50.672
Find Sandeman.

21:52.793 --> 21:55.023
Does that name mean something to you?

21:55.113 --> 21:59.265
Joshua called him "father". Got a feeling
he founded Manticore or something.

22:00.033 --> 22:04.072
Well, if that's true, why would he turn
Joshua away and report him to the cops?

22:04.153 --> 22:06.144
Think I'll ask him. Later.

22:07.353 --> 22:09.947
- Did you get a lead on dog boy?
- Sorta. Come on.

22:10.033 --> 22:12.991
You go ahead.
We'll cover more ground if we split up.

22:13.073 --> 22:15.712
- Right. Hit me up if you find him.
- You got it.

22:18.113 --> 22:21.867
There you go, honey. Safe and sound.
Nobody can get through there.

22:22.953 --> 22:27.663
You Sandeman?
You don't look like the father of my country.

22:27.753 --> 22:31.223
- Manticore mean anything to you?
- I don't know what you want.

22:31.313 --> 22:34.111
I asked you a question.
Got any little mutant kids?

22:34.193 --> 22:37.503
- I don't know what you mean.
- Know about genetic enhancement?

22:37.593 --> 22:39.948
- He got me these.
- Marlene...

22:49.513 --> 22:54.189
Bongo! Where are you, boy?
Come on, boy!

23:11.873 --> 23:14.512
You're not really going to eat that, are you?

23:14.833 --> 23:16.393
Come on, sister. Have a little dignity.

23:16.393 --> 23:16.984
Come on, sister. Have a little dignity.

23:19.993 --> 23:22.507
That's right. Dinner bell's a-chimin'.

23:22.833 --> 23:25.028
Come and get it.

23:34.193 --> 23:35.831
Bitch!

23:54.953 --> 23:57.990
- Bongo!
- Shut up!

24:01.593 --> 24:03.584
Come here.

24:09.193 --> 24:12.822
Bongo! There you are. Come on, fella.

24:26.553 --> 24:30.023
If this Sandeman founded Manticore,
how come you don't know his name?

24:30.113 --> 24:32.388
It's not like there was a statue in the quad.

24:32.473 --> 24:35.704
I never heard of the guy until
Joshua and then Renfro said something.

24:35.793 --> 24:38.387
Some crap about me being
the one they're looking for.

24:38.473 --> 24:41.067
I wonder if that's what
Lydecker was talking about.

24:41.153 --> 24:44.463
He called. Said something
about your DNA being unusual.

24:44.553 --> 24:47.909
- Whatever.
- Not whatever. There's something goin' on.

24:47.993 --> 24:52.271
Yeah. Joshua's out there and he needs
my help. Did you get the other addresses?

24:52.353 --> 24:56.028
Yeah. And they don't add up.
None of the others are named Sandeman.

24:56.353 --> 25:00.551
- It doesn't make any sense.
- Plus, they're all over town. No pattern.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.431
So we've got nothing.

25:07.113 --> 25:10.628
Don't tell me you sold your Hockney
to pay that lab-tech creep.

25:10.713 --> 25:11.862
Yeah.

25:11.953 --> 25:14.421
Your grandmother left that to you.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.027
Small price to pay.

25:17.873 --> 25:22.105
The creep called. Says that he analysed
the blood sample you gave him.

25:22.193 --> 25:25.185
- Thinks he's close to a cure.
- Are you serious?

25:29.113 --> 25:31.104
Wants you to come by tomorrow.

25:33.873 --> 25:38.867
Whether he comes through or not,
I'm kicking in for half of this.

25:39.433 --> 25:41.230
It's OK.

25:41.313 --> 25:43.952
I want this too, you know.

25:44.993 --> 25:48.952
- Get it to me when you can.
...a crazed dog cornered in his garage.

25:49.033 --> 25:51.672
Make that a guy. No, make that a dog.

25:51.753 --> 25:55.029
- Whatever. We'll check it out.
- 349 Whitney.

25:56.113 --> 25:58.707
Do you think that...

26:00.953 --> 26:03.387
One move and I'll blow your head off!

26:10.873 --> 26:12.864
- What is it?
- Don't ask me.

26:13.353 --> 26:16.902
- It was rummaging through my garbage.
- Should've called Animal Control.

26:16.993 --> 26:19.223
Stay back. I'm warning you.

26:39.553 --> 26:41.748
Joshua?

26:50.593 --> 26:53.107
One down, two to go.

27:14.913 --> 27:17.268
Sir? Are we remobilising?

27:22.793 --> 27:25.671
Follow me. Don't make a big deal out of it.

27:36.833 --> 27:40.064
- Where's your squad?
- We got separated when the fire broke out.

27:40.153 --> 27:42.508
Then I saw the signal
that told us to go to ground.

27:42.593 --> 27:44.982
- So you're alone?
- Yes, sir.

28:11.833 --> 28:15.223
- What are we looking at here?
- A Kiloma Indian burial site,

28:15.313 --> 28:17.781
probably from the early 1800s.

28:18.553 --> 28:22.182
These pictures, they're just like in the stories.

28:22.673 --> 28:24.664
- Stories?
- Legend has it

28:25.193 --> 28:28.390
that a group of white fur traders
kidnapped a girl from the tribe,

28:28.473 --> 28:30.464
forced her to have a child for them.

28:30.553 --> 28:32.544
- With who?
- A boy they had with them.

28:32.633 --> 28:35.830
He was only 14, but described
as being over six feet tall.

28:35.913 --> 28:39.792
The baby was stillborn. Terribly deformed.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.269
They forced her to have another.

28:43.993 --> 28:47.508
They weren't satisfied
until the third was born.

28:47.593 --> 28:50.061
- They took the child away.
- And killed the mother.

28:51.193 --> 28:53.263
Why was this child so important?

28:53.353 --> 28:56.470
I don't know.
I always assumed it was just a story.

28:56.553 --> 28:59.943
What about the last picture?
The one with the painting on the wall?

29:00.033 --> 29:03.742
It's not a Kiloma design.
I've never seen anything like it.

29:03.833 --> 29:05.824
I have.

29:06.673 --> 29:10.222
I might be able to tell you more
if I can see the original photos.

29:10.993 --> 29:13.188
I'll bring them to you.

29:15.393 --> 29:16.542
Tonight.

29:19.793 --> 29:23.547
So, I got two.
I just need more time to get the third.

29:23.633 --> 29:26.227
- We had an agreement.
- Just a few hours.

29:26.313 --> 29:30.022
That's not what I'm talking about.
I told you to kill them.

29:31.633 --> 29:33.908
Yeah.

29:38.913 --> 29:44.749
Someone left him outside an emergency
room with a bandage on the back of his neck.

29:44.833 --> 29:48.462
- He was just a kid.
- You disappoint me.

29:49.993 --> 29:54.703
Now, apparently, you had no trouble
with whatever this was.

29:54.793 --> 29:59.628
But him... Well, you know, you couldn't do it.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.586
So now you're a dead man.

30:03.953 --> 30:07.707
I can do it. Give me another chance.

30:11.033 --> 30:15.231
All right. I'll let him count
against your final total.

30:16.473 --> 30:18.589
But you still owe me one more.

30:19.953 --> 30:22.547
Say thank you.

30:22.633 --> 30:24.464
Thank you.

30:24.553 --> 30:27.784
- Can I have more time?
- No.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.388
But you can have this.

30:31.473 --> 30:36.422
Maybe if you don't have to listen
to them beg and scream,

30:37.033 --> 30:39.467
you can actually go through with it.

30:42.073 --> 30:44.303
Ticktock.

30:57.033 --> 31:00.582
I think I've figured it out.
Why the addresses don't add up.

31:00.673 --> 31:06.350
Joshua's been looking for Sandeman all right.
It's just his information's out of date.

31:06.433 --> 31:09.345
- What do you mean?
- Well...

31:09.433 --> 31:12.869
I ran the addresses I got against
the listings in a pre-Pulse directory.

31:12.953 --> 31:16.548
Ten years ago, people with the last name
Sandeman lived at all six addresses.

31:16.633 --> 31:20.387
Joshua must've gotten an old directory
and not realised it's no good.

31:20.473 --> 31:21.513
He's going through 'em one by one, in order.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.026
He's going through 'em one by one, in order.

31:23.113 --> 31:25.388
- Any left?
- Two more.

31:26.433 --> 31:28.742
Thanks, Logan. I'd hug you, but...

31:29.553 --> 31:31.544
Maybe in a couple of days.

31:40.073 --> 31:42.906
- Max.
- You scared me.

31:42.993 --> 31:45.871
- We need to talk.
- Wish I could, but I don't have time.

31:45.953 --> 31:49.992
I'm afraid you're gonna have to make time.
It's a matter of life and death.

31:50.073 --> 31:52.143
- Mine.
- Look...

31:52.233 --> 31:57.512
I don't know what your drama is, but I got
a lead on Joshua, and I'm outta here now.

31:57.593 --> 31:59.584
- Joshua?
- Yep.

32:04.993 --> 32:07.348
- I'll go with you.
- Fine. Ready?

32:08.833 --> 32:10.824
Yeah.

32:17.873 --> 32:21.946
This is the right address.
Guess they tore the place down.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.263
Joshua!

32:31.873 --> 32:33.864
Max.

32:35.673 --> 32:38.426
- Hey, big fella.
- Hey, little fella.

32:38.793 --> 32:41.227
How you doin'? I've been worried.

32:41.993 --> 32:44.587
Father not here. Not anywhere.

32:46.553 --> 32:49.989
- Where'd you get that?
- Took it from people upstairs.

32:51.473 --> 32:55.068
- After Father left.
- See, those addresses are old.

32:55.153 --> 32:58.429
That means that those people
may not live there any more.

32:59.713 --> 33:01.829
One more.

33:02.793 --> 33:05.148
OK. We'll check it out.

33:05.713 --> 33:08.591
I hate to be a kill joy,
but nobody's goin' anywhere.

33:27.313 --> 33:29.429
Where is it?

33:29.513 --> 33:31.708
Where the hell is your bar code?

33:31.793 --> 33:36.184
No bar code. I was first. Special.

33:49.473 --> 33:52.306
I'm sorry.

33:52.393 --> 33:54.907
There's no other way.

33:57.353 --> 34:00.151
- Alec...
- I don't wanna die.

34:29.112 --> 34:32.661
Yeah. Thought so.
Planted a few myself, back in the day.

34:36.152 --> 34:39.509
How did you end up with one of these
popguns attached to your brainstem?

34:39.592 --> 34:43.745
He's a cold-blooded show-off who thought
he could run his game on a major bad guy,

34:43.833 --> 34:47.348
who, it turns out,
is an even bigger scumbag than he is.

34:47.433 --> 34:50.550
- That about cover it?
- That's pretty much how it happened.

34:50.632 --> 34:53.943
Before I forget,
thanks so much for not killing me.

34:54.033 --> 34:56.308
Me too.

34:56.393 --> 34:58.748
I can disarm it. It'll cost you ten grand.

34:58.833 --> 35:01.142
That the only number you know?

35:03.393 --> 35:06.351
- I can get you the rest later.
- Need it upfront.

35:07.913 --> 35:11.701
How the hell am I gonna get that kind of cash
in the next five minutes, huh?

35:11.793 --> 35:13.943
Wait.

35:14.433 --> 35:16.822
You're paying me back.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.262
No problem.

35:24.993 --> 35:27.746
Great. I can leave town tonight.

35:27.833 --> 35:32.509
- What? You haven't finished my job.
- Have I mentioned that my life is in danger?

35:32.593 --> 35:35.665
- I'll make sure nothing happens to you.
- Not good enough.

35:35.753 --> 35:39.632
Look, you can have the work
that I've done so far. Take my analysis.

35:39.953 --> 35:42.547
Find some other Manticore geek
to help you finish it.

35:42.633 --> 35:43.273
- Where?
- Don't know.

35:43.273 --> 35:44.342
- Where?
- Don't know.

35:44.433 --> 35:48.904
If they're smart like me, they're probably
already on their way outta town.

35:48.993 --> 35:52.827
We got a deal?
This guy's got about two minutes to live.

35:57.113 --> 35:59.104
Do it.

36:06.233 --> 36:08.872
- Time's almost up, pal.
- Don't distract me.

36:14.353 --> 36:16.503
Congratulations. You're not dead.

36:21.073 --> 36:23.462
That's it. I'm outta here.

36:24.153 --> 36:26.144
Sayonara.

36:32.553 --> 36:34.862
I owe you, Max. I know I screwed things up...

36:34.953 --> 36:38.070
Shut up! And listen,
cos I'm only saying this once.

36:38.913 --> 36:43.145
That guy was the last chance for me
and Logan. He's gone and it's your fault.

36:43.513 --> 36:46.505
Don't think I'm ever getting over that.

36:46.593 --> 36:48.584
I know.

36:48.673 --> 36:51.904
Just do me a favour, all right?

36:53.273 --> 36:56.185
Go away.

36:56.273 --> 36:58.343
I can't even look at you right now.

37:18.873 --> 37:20.864
I'm sorry, Max.

37:21.753 --> 37:23.744
For everything.

37:28.273 --> 37:29.433
I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up anyway.

37:29.433 --> 37:31.151
I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up anyway.

37:34.313 --> 37:37.350
I just wish I knew
what I was gonna tell Logan.

38:19.793 --> 38:24.548
Body must have been thrown clear.
Guess we're gonna have to drag the river.

38:38.793 --> 38:41.182
This is the last address.

38:59.713 --> 39:02.511
- Father's house.
- You sure?

39:04.393 --> 39:06.384
His books.

39:08.593 --> 39:10.584
I remember.

39:32.153 --> 39:34.348
The Manticore symbol.

39:38.273 --> 39:39.547
See?

39:40.833 --> 39:44.030
No. Father's.

39:56.833 --> 40:00.872
There she is. My little one.

40:00.953 --> 40:02.944
My special little one.

40:08.993 --> 40:10.267
Max?

40:10.353 --> 40:12.025
Little fella. Max.

40:13.233 --> 40:15.747
- Father not here.
- No.

40:15.833 --> 40:21.305
Looks like he hasn't been here in a long time.
I'm sorry. I know that wasn't the plan.

40:21.393 --> 40:24.544
Joshua and Father. That's the plan.

40:24.833 --> 40:27.552
Max, Joshua and Father. That's the plan.

40:27.953 --> 40:32.026
You wanna find him, I'll help you.
I got some questions for this guy.

40:32.353 --> 40:36.392
He'll help you.
Just like the man helped your friend.

40:36.473 --> 40:38.782
You think he can cure this virus thing?

40:42.313 --> 40:44.702
He made us.

40:44.793 --> 40:48.388
He'll make you better.
And that's what you tell Logan.

40:49.873 --> 40:52.512
To have hopes up.

40:54.433 --> 40:56.424
OK.

41:48.513 --> 41:50.583
