01:14.060 --> 01:16.130
WOMAN:
There is darkness...

01:21.100 --> 01:23.091
.. and there is light.

01:39.540 --> 01:41.815
There are men and women.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.658
There 's food.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.130
There are restaurants.

02:01.180 --> 02:02.977
Disease.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.371
There 's work.

02:19.660 --> 02:22.128
Traffic.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.014
The days as we know them.

02:31.740 --> 02:34.015
The world as we imagine the world.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.571
Hey.

02:59.660 --> 03:01.139
Hey.

03:08.340 --> 03:10.695
How would you feel
about head i ng home?

03:13.300 --> 03:15.495
I 've only just fallen asleep.

03:15.540 --> 03:17.735
Well, you have, I haven't.

03:19.540 --> 03:22.771
I have a tough time sleeping
with someone else in the bed.

03:25.820 --> 03:27.572
Are you kicking me out?

03:27.620 --> 03:29.770
I have to go to work soon anyway.

03:31.740 --> 03:34.652
We dance and drink all night,
we go back to your place, you fuck me

03:34.740 --> 03:36.935
and now you wake me up
and kick me out?

03:36.980 --> 03:39.448
I can't sleep
with another person in the bed.

03:41.180 --> 03:44.217
- That's funny.
- That's just the way it is.

03:48.540 --> 03:50.531
[cry of seagulls]

03:52.460 --> 03:55.020
I didn't know
you'd started smoking again.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.016
What do you feel like doing?

04:10.180 --> 04:12.171
Throwing stones.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.094
At what?

04:18.860 --> 04:20.976
Seagulls.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.611
Sweetheart.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.660
- You'll find someone.
- Shut up and throw.

04:51.660 --> 04:53.651
I suppose I should go back to work.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.178
Come on.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.450
Poor baby.

05:54.180 --> 05:56.171
Lebanon?

05:57.580 --> 05:59.571
Morocco.

06:01.540 --> 06:03.610
Morocco.

06:08.940 --> 06:10.771
Now that's funny.

06:11.580 --> 06:15.255
- What's funny?
- Seeing you today.

06:15.340 --> 06:16.693
Hilarious.

06:16.740 --> 06:20.415
Come with me for a minute, will you?
They want us at the hospital.

06:21.940 --> 06:24.454
Aren't you going to ask
why I haven't been to work?

06:24.500 --> 06:28.334
- Well, you've been sick.
- Not sick, just unhappy.

06:29.940 --> 06:31.976
Well, it's the same thing.

06:32.060 --> 06:34.096
Unhappy on account of a man.

06:34.740 --> 06:36.731
No kidding?

06:37.460 --> 06:39.735
So what are we wanted for?

06:39.780 --> 06:42.135
Er, to see a patient.

06:42.180 --> 06:44.250
- Why?
- What's going on?

06:44.300 --> 06:45.892
Well, we're just going to find out.

06:45.980 --> 06:49.131
- You know he's really pissed off in there.
- Excuse me.

06:49.180 --> 06:50.659
When can I take him back home?

06:51.860 --> 06:54.852
Oh, well, we just need
to talk to him, so...

06:54.900 --> 06:57.289
- He needs to explain it all again?
- Well...

06:57.340 --> 06:58.853
Look. Look, listen.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.972
He called me up, right,
and he told me he was coming home...

07:02.020 --> 07:06.457
and then all of a sudden his voice breaks
and he bursts into tears.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.774
Mm-hm.

07:07.820 --> 07:11.779
And then he starts telling me
that he doesn't see any meaning to life.

07:11.820 --> 07:15.096
I mean, he's not usually like that.
He's a truck driver.

07:15.140 --> 07:16.175
OK.

07:16.220 --> 07:19.690
And then he pulls over at the side
and says he's fine again.

07:19.740 --> 07:23.938
- Except, he cannae smell any more.
- He can't smell any more?

07:24.020 --> 07:26.215
Well, I told him to find a hospital

07:26.260 --> 07:28.854
because, you know,
that isn't normal, is it?

07:39.020 --> 07:41.898
Hello, er... Donald.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.776
Stephen Montgomery here again.

07:49.620 --> 07:52.657
- Hi, I'm Susan.
- Hello, Stephen. Hello, Susan.

07:53.820 --> 07:56.573
- You can't smell any more?
- That's right, Susan.

07:56.620 --> 07:58.497
I can 't smell any more.

07:58.540 --> 08:00.974
But is your mood back to normal?

08:01.060 --> 08:04.052
I've been sitting here for nearly
11 hours. My mood is not great.

08:06.420 --> 08:09.332
But you don 't feel any discomfort
other than a lack of smell?

08:09.380 --> 08:10.859
No, Susan.

08:10.900 --> 08:14.939
And has anybody else in your family
or at work had similar experiences?

08:14.980 --> 08:17.972
I haven't got a clue
cos I'm sitting here, aren't l?

08:22.620 --> 08:26.249
- What do you want from me?
- I just want your opinion.

08:26.340 --> 08:30.299
I'm an epidemiologist, Stephen.
So why am I talking to this guy?

08:30.340 --> 08:33.251
Cos we've got seven more
just like him in Aberdeen.

08:33.299 --> 08:34.938
Five in Dundee.

08:34.980 --> 08:38.450
11 right here in Glasgow.
18 in Edinburgh.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.094
There's over 100 reported cases
in England.

08:41.140 --> 08:45.019
They've got them in France,
Belgium, ltaly, Spain.

08:46.540 --> 08:49.213
They've all appeared
in the last 24 hours.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.891
How were they infected?

08:55.820 --> 08:57.856
I'm not sure they are.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.652
Meaning?

09:00.500 --> 09:05.972
Well, all the early indications suggest
no connection between them at all.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.215
No contact. No pattern. Nothing.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.496
[glass mutes voice]

09:14.100 --> 09:17.251
Is my wife still out there?
Let me speak to my wife.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.575
Please, let me speak to my wife.

09:22.380 --> 09:24.371
[glass mutes voice]

09:27.580 --> 09:29.730
STEPH EN :
Maybe it'll just go away.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.534
- So we won't panic.
- Hm.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.171
[chatter and laughter]

09:46.660 --> 09:49.254
Michael, that's a table of 12
just sat down.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.132
- Where are they, at the bar?
- Yeah.

09:51.140 --> 09:54.416
Where's that lobster and haggis?
I need that right now.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.298
- That's table five, mains.
- You're an arsehole.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.972
- What's the matter with you?
- What?

09:59.020 --> 10:02.251
- Those starters for table seven...
- That girl was such a sweetheart.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.336
- What girl?
- "What girl?"

10:04.380 --> 10:06.769
You just fucked her and dumped her,
didn't you?

10:06.780 --> 10:09.499
- Poor little baby.
- Theresa, where's those salads?

10:09.540 --> 10:13.215
OK, one oysters, one soup, an antipasti,
two duck and a steak rare.

10:13.260 --> 10:14.898
Yes, Chef.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.617
I'd have made her breakfast.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.168
Strawberries,
heated the milk for her coffee.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.610
But they don't want to fuck the nice guy.
They want to fuck the arsehole.

10:24.660 --> 10:27.094
- Next two checks at the same time.
- Yes, Chef.

10:27.180 --> 10:29.489
How about those ravioli, boys?
How long on those?

10:29.500 --> 10:32.173
- Three minutes, Chef.
- Right, right, right.

10:32.820 --> 10:34.538
- Chef.
- OK, how do we know it's fresh?

10:34.580 --> 10:36.093
- We smell it?
- No, check the eyes.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.370
They should be clear.
The gills should be red.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.934
- It should be firm. And the smell?
- Fishy?

10:40.940 --> 10:43.408
It can smell fishy.
But, if it does, it's not fresh.

10:43.420 --> 10:46.014
It should smell like the sea.
Does it smell like the sea?

10:46.060 --> 10:49.575
- Mostly smells of fish.
- Get me another fucking sea bass.

10:51.260 --> 10:53.012
One day.

10:54.700 --> 10:57.373
One day, son, you'll be in love.

10:59.060 --> 11:01.779
And you'll be miserable.
Table seven. That's your karma.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.653
- Hot pot!
- Truly in love and miserable.

11:05.180 --> 11:06.932
Richard, I need that pot back!

11:06.980 --> 11:08.129
Richard!

11:33.020 --> 11:35.011
[phone buzzes]

11:40.420 --> 11:42.650
- Hi, Jen.
- Hi, sweetheart.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.931
- Listen... [inaudible]
- Really?

11:48.780 --> 11:50.736
- Do you want to come with me?
- Of course I do.

11:50.780 --> 11:51.769
Great.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.537
I can find someone
else if you're busy.

12:08.580 --> 12:11.014
Don't worry, it might not be that serious.

12:11.060 --> 12:13.096
I'll call you as soon as I know more.

12:13.140 --> 12:15.335
- OK?
[wolf whistle]

12:15.380 --> 12:17.530
You wouldn't happen to have
a spare cigarette?

12:17.620 --> 12:19.929
- I'm on the phone.
- Who's that you're talking to?

12:19.980 --> 12:23.495
Oh, nothing.
It's just a guy asking for a cigarette.

12:23.540 --> 12:25.053
- OK, I better go.
- Yeah.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.897
- Bye.
- Hmm.

12:26.940 --> 12:29.579
- OK, OK. Bye.
- Have you got a light?

12:32.420 --> 12:34.650
How about board and lodging,
while we're at it?

12:35.620 --> 12:37.690
Nah, I don't even know your name.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.012
Do you have one, though?

12:43.500 --> 12:45.377
Shit.

12:46.180 --> 12:47.898
Oh, dear.

12:48.820 --> 12:51.334
I'm Michael.
I work in the restaurant there.

12:54.020 --> 12:56.659
- All right, sailor.
- I'm a chef.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.691
Good for you.

13:01.340 --> 13:03.490
Come on, guys. What have we got?

13:03.540 --> 13:06.691
We've checked all the Scottish cases
but have no obvious matches.

13:06.740 --> 13:09.208
No proteins mutating, no prions, nothing.

13:09.260 --> 13:13.014
There's nothing to say it's a virus.
Nothing that matches anything we know.

13:13.060 --> 13:16.177
But it's fair to say
it isn't obviously contagious.

13:16.220 --> 13:17.972
It's fair to say it's spreading.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.019
OK.

13:20.060 --> 13:23.655
Could be environmental, it could be
a toxin we know nothing about.

13:23.740 --> 13:26.208
It could be terrorism.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.973
OK, so it's not a contagion.

13:29.060 --> 13:34.498
I'll tell them... probably disappear
in a short while and don't panic.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.298
Maybe they put something in the water.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.975
Overwhelmed with grief.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.174
People are hit with all
that they've lost.

14:13.980 --> 14:16.096
Lovers they never had.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.570
All the departed friends.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.618
They think of all the
people they've hurt.

14:44.860 --> 14:47.169
First, overwhelmed with grief.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.375
And then no sense of smell.

14:56.380 --> 14:58.371
That's the disease.

15:05.540 --> 15:08.259
They call it Severe
Olfactory Syndrome.

15:11.020 --> 15:12.772
SOS.

15:14.020 --> 15:18.775
TV: This is a cause for concern and
requires a heightened state of alert.

15:20.140 --> 15:22.176
But it's not a cause for alarm.

[news reports i n various languages]

We stand ready for the arrival

15:34.060 --> 15:36.699

that the human race...

15:58.260 --> 16:00.296
They say it isn 't contagious.

16:03.780 --> 16:06.010
But who dare believe that?

16:32.460 --> 16:34.451
Nothing.

16:40.860 --> 16:42.532
Well, shall we call it a night?

16:42.620 --> 16:44.656
I don't know what the fuck
we should call it.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.895
Let's go chase some pretty ladies, huh?

16:46.940 --> 16:49.659
- You chase, I'll pick up the pieces.
- I don't feel like it.

16:49.700 --> 16:52.897
Come on.
You want to watch that, Rich.

16:52.940 --> 16:55.852

too much high-class fanny.

He's been gorging himself
on Europe's finest.

- I'm going to get the Entonox quick!
- What's that?

17:00.620 --> 17:03.657
Entonox. Laughing gas. Saint Nitrous.

18:08.540 --> 18:11.691
He never went sailing anywhere
but he called everybody sailor.

19:54.980 --> 20:00.054
This is a mango jelly
and chocolate macaroons.

20:01.420 --> 20:02.694
And...

20:05.380 --> 20:06.654
I didn't make these.

20:06.700 --> 20:10.090
I can't remember what the fuck
that's called, but it's got coconut in it.

20:12.300 --> 20:13.892
God...

20:15.140 --> 20:17.529
All that sailor stuff,
it reminds me of him.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.497
My dad.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.250
I miss him so much.

20:24.340 --> 20:28.015
We had so much fun together.
He could always make me laugh.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.051
Hey... Hey.

20:32.620 --> 20:34.338
Let me get you...

20:36.420 --> 20:39.093
Here. This is... This is clean.

20:41.020 --> 20:43.773
Thank you. [blows nose]

20:48.700 --> 20:50.133
OK.

20:54.700 --> 20:56.213
[sobs]

20:59.380 --> 21:00.972
Here, here. You're all right.

21:01.940 --> 21:04.977
Do not stand so close. You never know.

21:05.100 --> 21:08.137
- Oh, no, they say it's not contagious.
- We don't know.

21:08.180 --> 21:10.455
It's just something we tell people.

21:13.620 --> 21:17.249
Look... Would you... Would you like me
to take you back to your home?

21:17.340 --> 21:18.932
Yeah? Come on.

21:18.940 --> 21:21.329
You take the cloth. I'll get the...

21:21.380 --> 21:23.177
Come on, come on.

21:23.260 --> 21:25.251
[rain falling]

21:30.540 --> 21:32.531
[she sobs]

22:20.300 --> 22:22.291
[stifled sobbing]

22:44.020 --> 22:46.011
[he sobs]

23:08.020 --> 23:09.578
Oh...

23:30.140 --> 23:33.257
- Hey.
- It's gone.

23:34.300 --> 23:36.894
The smell.

23:36.940 --> 23:39.215
All gone.

24:09.140 --> 24:11.176
Well, I think I'll...

24:11.900 --> 24:14.050
That was a crazy evening.

24:14.100 --> 24:15.772
Yeah.

24:44.620 --> 24:46.850
[clicks tongue]

24:46.900 --> 24:48.891
Good morning.

24:48.940 --> 24:50.293
[sniffs]

24:50.340 --> 24:53.252
Mmm. Well, it has its benefits.

24:54.420 --> 24:56.456
- Yep.
[he sniffs]

25:01.540 --> 25:03.610
We were in the Algarve once,
Maggie and me.

25:03.660 --> 25:07.096
Came home, had a freezer full of food,
there'd been a power cut.

25:07.140 --> 25:09.938
Never smelt anything so disgusting
in my life.

25:09.980 --> 25:12.016
I'll never forget it.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.851
Maybe you will.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.811
Hm.

25:23.380 --> 25:25.371
I've met someone.

25:25.460 --> 25:28.418
- Oh, OK.
- I'm pathetic.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.456
Mm-hm.

25:30.460 --> 25:32.610
I'm not even sure I like him.

25:33.460 --> 25:34.893
OK.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.533
I actually think he's a smooth arsehole.

25:45.220 --> 25:46.699
Now...

25:48.500 --> 25:50.775
It'll probably come back.

25:50.820 --> 25:54.210
But at the moment our customers
won't be able to smell, so...

25:54.260 --> 25:57.457
It'll be like cooking
for snotty-nosed people.

25:59.260 --> 26:01.376
Bring out the big guns, all right?

26:03.060 --> 26:05.335
Maybe a bit of saffron.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.328
Oregano.

26:17.700 --> 26:20.055
Richard, can you get me a clean apple?

26:23.060 --> 26:25.130
Life goes on.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.735
The food becomes spicier...

26:29.540 --> 26:31.371
..saltier...

26:31.420 --> 26:32.853
more sweet...

26:32.900 --> 26:34.538
more sour.

26:36.340 --> 26:37.853
You get used to it.

26:41.740 --> 26:46.097
The greater loss are all the memories
that are no longer triggered.

26:46.140 --> 26:47.129
Ooh-hoo!

26:47.180 --> 26:49.933
Smell and memory
were connected in the brain.

26:51.420 --> 26:55.015
Cinnamon might have reminded you
of your grandmother's apron.

26:55.060 --> 26:58.939
The scent of cut hay
could evoke a childhood fear of cows.

27:00.420 --> 27:04.254
Diesel oil might bring back memories
of your first ferry crossing.

27:06.500 --> 27:10.413
Without smell,
an ocean of past images disappears.

27:33.980 --> 27:35.493
Whoa!

27:43.540 --> 27:45.531
[he wh istles]

27:46.940 --> 27:49.454
[wh istles agai n]

27:53.620 --> 27:55.815
I 'm off work.

27:55.860 --> 27:58.010
Cong ratulations.

27:58.660 --> 28:01.174
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

28:01.980 --> 28:03.971
Any more news on death and misery?

28:04.740 --> 28:06.219
Not really.

28:07.260 --> 28:09.535
I was a really good smeller.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.616
- I bet you were.
- I was.

28:12.860 --> 28:14.851
Do you want a cigarette?

28:14.900 --> 28:17.494
- No, thanks.
- Something else, then?

28:18.620 --> 28:21.088
- Like what?
- Oh, er... are you hungry?

28:21.860 --> 28:22.849
Nah.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.850
I could cook you something special.

28:26.180 --> 28:28.455
Or buy you a lollipop.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.970
We could go for a coffee
and eat apple pie and er... Iiquorice.

28:33.060 --> 28:34.618
A glass of wine?

28:35.700 --> 28:37.179
Some fresh air?

28:39.300 --> 28:41.291
Come on.

28:43.740 --> 28:45.173
[violin music]

28:45.220 --> 28:47.814
My sister got married here
a few years ago

28:47.860 --> 28:50.055
and I came to stay for a month and...

28:51.060 --> 28:53.779
- Met a guy.
- And then a good job came up.

28:53.860 --> 28:55.578
And now, ladies and gentlemen.

28:55.620 --> 28:57.451
We'll call upon a new smell.

28:57.500 --> 29:00.173
The scent of the forest
after the spring rain.

29:00.900 --> 29:03.368
We imagine the path
underneath our feet.

29:04.140 --> 29:08.418
We see the green moist color
surrounding us.

29:09.100 --> 29:13.730
And we feel the wet branches
against our faces.

29:16.980 --> 29:18.971
And now imagine...

29:19.740 --> 29:21.696
- Oh...
- We pass between the trees.

29:21.740 --> 29:24.334
- I'm not going on my own. Come on.
- Oh, no.

29:24.420 --> 29:26.888
And we begin drawing in the air.

29:26.940 --> 29:29.010
Deep inside.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.255
And enjoy the moment.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.535
The humidity level is high.

29:37.580 --> 29:39.093
[plays dramatic tune]

29:44.340 --> 29:49.892
At the lower end there is the moss,
the fungi, the rotten leaves.

29:55.580 --> 29:59.175
The middle tone is the tall, fresh grass.

29:59.860 --> 30:02.579
A crisp and almost invigorating scent.

30:03.380 --> 30:05.371
[plucks high notes]

30:06.300 --> 30:10.009
And at the top we feel
not only the leaves and the rainwater,

30:10.060 --> 30:12.051
but also the sky.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.852
[high, ringing note]

30:13.980 --> 30:18.292
On a day like this...
we can smell the sky itself.

30:20.180 --> 30:22.171
[mellow tune]

30:32.580 --> 30:34.730
What shall we do now?

30:37.860 --> 30:40.579
Well, now you could invite me
back to your place.

30:42.100 --> 30:44.091
Don't know if I will.

30:46.100 --> 30:48.660
Well, you... you can just start
walking home...

30:49.340 --> 30:51.331
..and I'll follow you.

31:05.180 --> 31:07.171
[she laughs]

31:39.740 --> 31:41.731
- Oh.
[they laugh]

31:56.060 --> 31:58.051
[sniffs]

32:02.260 --> 32:04.137
Mm.

32:04.180 --> 32:06.569
I should have made a bigger effort
to sniff you

32:06.620 --> 32:08.611
the first time we were lying here.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.332
Mm.

32:13.180 --> 32:15.250
A pity.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.131
What do you want?

32:25.860 --> 32:28.010
What do I want?

32:29.260 --> 32:31.251
Yeah.

32:33.500 --> 32:37.413
Well, soon I'd like to close my eyes
and try and go to sleep.

32:38.820 --> 32:43.655
Which is a big deal for me cos usually
l... I can't sleep in bed with someone.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.970
I need to be by myself.

33:06.020 --> 33:07.419
OK?

33:08.180 --> 33:10.978
- Now?
- Now, yes.

33:11.820 --> 33:13.811
You want me to leave?

33:13.860 --> 33:15.896
I live here, so I guess you'll have to.

33:16.580 --> 33:18.650
- Now?
- Yes, please.

33:21.460 --> 33:23.655
Did I say something wrong?

33:45.860 --> 33:50.331
Ah... Let me give you my... card,

33:50.380 --> 33:54.931
in case you want to, you know...
call me or something.

33:55.020 --> 33:56.692
You have a card?

33:56.740 --> 34:00.096
I had a catering company
that didn't do very well.

34:00.140 --> 34:03.291
Not very many clients. Lots of cards.

34:10.179 --> 34:12.091
You can call me.

34:12.219 --> 34:14.255
My number's on there, and my address.

34:15.060 --> 34:17.290
And I guess you know
where I work, so...

34:26.139 --> 34:28.130
[door bangs]

34:39.780 --> 34:43.136
MAN: Repent, sinners!
The day of the Lord is upon you.

34:43.219 --> 34:45.813
Do you know that this is
the day of the Lord?

34:45.860 --> 34:48.010
The prophecy has been spoken.

34:48.100 --> 34:51.809
Do you pray?
Are you aware of your sins?

34:51.860 --> 34:55.250
Come back and be aware.
This is the day of the prophecy!

35:39.660 --> 35:41.139
Hello.

35:42.460 --> 35:44.018
No flowers?

35:51.860 --> 35:53.976
She loved flowers, Michael.

36:10.380 --> 36:12.371
Ian got married...

36:13.220 --> 36:15.256
in a church with the full monty.

36:15.380 --> 36:17.336
Eugh!

36:17.380 --> 36:20.531
Apparently, she's pregnant, his bride.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.131
And what about this Michael?

36:26.620 --> 36:28.611
What about him?

36:28.620 --> 36:30.372
He sounds nice.

36:31.140 --> 36:32.698
I don't know.

36:32.740 --> 36:34.731
I usually pick arseholes.

36:36.140 --> 36:39.052
Well, they can't all be arseholes.
They just can't.

36:40.100 --> 36:42.660
- I'm trying to take care of myself.
- Right.

36:44.140 --> 36:46.131
You do that a lot, don't you?

36:47.780 --> 36:49.771
- Fuck you, sailor!
[laughs]

36:49.820 --> 36:52.050
[children clamouring]

36:52.060 --> 36:54.528
Can I have sweets?

36:54.580 --> 36:56.571
Let me see.

36:56.620 --> 36:58.099
Hmm...

36:59.380 --> 37:01.416
- Ta-da!
- Whoo!

37:02.140 --> 37:04.449
- What do you say?
- One for you and one for you.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.491
Not soap.

37:08.900 --> 37:11.334
Big Soap. Big Soap.

37:11.940 --> 37:17.492
Apparently, Big Tobacco and
Big Fizzy Cola have formed this cartel

37:17.540 --> 37:20.771
to start selling wait for it
fruity flavoured oxygen.

37:21.300 --> 37:25.054
I n order to create a proper market for it,
they've enlisted Big Soap.

37:25.660 --> 37:29.938
Big Soap have flooded the environment
with enough organophosphates

37:29.980 --> 37:33.052
to temporarily disable
your central nervous system.

37:33.100 --> 37:35.091
That's why I've stopped washing...

37:35.140 --> 37:37.700
in case you were wondering
what the smell was.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.691
You don't half talk some shite.

37:42.940 --> 37:47.218
Environmental groups are sure it's
the start of an ecological apocalypse

37:47.260 --> 37:50.730
caused by pollution and genetically
modified plants and hormones.

37:51.300 --> 37:54.690
Intelligence claims
it's an attack on the free world.

37:55.380 --> 37:57.814
All indicators point
to fundamentalists.

37:57.820 --> 38:01.972
The fundamentalists talk of God's
punishment on a world of unbelievers...

38:02.700 --> 38:05.168
and promise that all pure people
of the right faith

38:05.220 --> 38:08.132
will regain their sense of smell
in the final days.

38:09.460 --> 38:12.213
Others talk of the degenerate
capitalist system

38:12.260 --> 38:16.094
that has released a military virus
to stimulate the economy.

38:18.220 --> 38:20.256
And there are other theories.

38:39.460 --> 38:41.496
[shouti ng]

38:49.740 --> 38:53.528
STEPH EN : Wake up.
There is so much hatred in the world!

38:53.540 --> 38:55.576
There's so much hatred!

38:56.060 --> 38:58.335
- Easy.
- So much hatred in the world!

38:58.420 --> 39:01.298
- They're fucking plotting against us.
- Stephen, calm down.

39:01.780 --> 39:04.340
They want to blow us up.
They want to destroy us.

39:05.340 --> 39:07.331
Fucking so much...

39:07.940 --> 39:10.613
- So much hatred.
- Ssh, ssh.

39:11.620 --> 39:13.178
There.

39:13.900 --> 39:17.939
So many sharp edges.
So many sharp edges.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.857
- That's OK.
- Sharp things.

39:19.900 --> 39:22.255
I've just given him
as much sedative as I dare.

39:22.260 --> 39:24.728
- So many sharp edges.
- lt'll kick in in a second.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.771
So many sharp edges.

39:26.820 --> 39:29.288
- Normally so soft. We are so soft.
- It's all right.

39:45.100 --> 39:47.091
[distant shouts]

40:20.780 --> 40:22.179
[panting]

40:22.180 --> 40:24.216
Hey, are you all right?

40:24.700 --> 40:26.691
I can't die alone.

40:26.740 --> 40:28.731
I'm here with you. I'm Barbara.

40:28.780 --> 40:30.418
I work in research.

40:30.500 --> 40:33.139
- I've seen you in the canteen.
- That's how it'll end.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.176
Without anybody loving me.

40:36.260 --> 40:38.251
Come on, now, just calm down.

40:38.300 --> 40:39.699
What's your name?

40:40.660 --> 40:42.651
Oh, no.

40:42.700 --> 40:44.850
See, the thing is, your body, OK?

40:44.900 --> 40:46.572
It betrays... It betrays itself.

40:46.620 --> 40:48.258
- Stop, Michael.
- No, no, listen.

40:48.260 --> 40:50.979
Your body,
it takes away the color of your skin.

40:51.020 --> 40:53.329
And... And betrays your... your spirit.

40:53.380 --> 40:54.859
Michael, stop.

40:54.900 --> 40:56.891
Can I get some water over here?

40:57.540 --> 40:59.132
That's OK, it's OK.

40:59.180 --> 41:02.809
Pissing and bleeding and fucking puss
is coming out of your ear!

41:02.820 --> 41:05.414
- There's no puss.
- I've seen it. I've seen it!

41:05.460 --> 41:07.337
At the end, you're all alone.

41:07.420 --> 41:08.739
Don't say that.

41:08.780 --> 41:10.896
You die on your own and it gets all dark.

41:10.940 --> 41:13.932
It's not true! Don't say that!
You're not on your own!

41:13.980 --> 41:15.971
You're not on your own!

41:16.060 --> 41:19.370
All your body, it turns...
it turns to fucking soup.

41:19.420 --> 41:20.614
First the terror.

41:20.660 --> 41:23.732
Don't leave me. Don't leave me, Michael.

41:23.780 --> 41:25.816
Don't leave me.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.896
And then a moment of hunger.

41:29.940 --> 41:31.931
Oh, my God. What's happened?

41:32.900 --> 41:35.619
Oh, my God, what's happened?
What's happening?

42:16.140 --> 42:18.131
[horn blares]

43:24.140 --> 43:26.176
[groans]

43:56.220 --> 43:59.451
This is how the sense of taste
disappears from our world.

44:05.460 --> 44:08.372
They don't even have time
to give the disease a name.

44:09.620 --> 44:11.611
[dog barks in distance]

44:35.700 --> 44:38.260
Do you think
we'll lose our other senses too?

44:41.940 --> 44:43.931
Smell and taste are related.

44:43.980 --> 44:46.016
They're the two chemical senses.

44:47.220 --> 44:49.609
So the other ones
might be all right, then?

44:50.540 --> 44:52.258
They might.

44:52.260 --> 44:54.296
Just have to wait and see.

44:55.300 --> 44:57.291
That's right, sailor.

45:03.660 --> 45:05.651
And what happens if you're wrong?

45:13.100 --> 45:15.136
[whispers]:
Then we're fucked.

47:00.380 --> 47:01.972
Hey.

47:02.020 --> 47:03.692
Hi.

47:05.180 --> 47:07.171
It's still out there.

47:08.260 --> 47:10.251
What is?

47:10.300 --> 47:12.291
The world.

47:13.820 --> 47:15.811
What can you see?

47:15.900 --> 47:17.777
People.

47:17.820 --> 47:19.811
What are they doing?

47:20.740 --> 47:22.731
They're heading off to work.

47:26.500 --> 47:28.491
What should we do?

47:31.820 --> 47:33.811
We go to work as well.

47:37.900 --> 47:39.891
Do we kiss each other first...

47:41.820 --> 47:43.378
Maybe.

47:45.620 --> 47:47.850
..Say we'd like to see each other again?

47:49.380 --> 47:51.371
We probably do.

47:51.420 --> 47:53.411
Maybe even this evening.

48:00.340 --> 48:01.409
Maybe.

48:03.860 --> 48:05.851
And are we looking forward to that?

48:07.340 --> 48:08.489
Yes!

48:17.180 --> 48:19.171
I may not even have a job any more.

48:24.300 --> 48:27.098
Forget it, Michael, we're closed.
We're closed.

48:27.140 --> 48:29.131
We'll open again.

48:29.180 --> 48:31.296
People can't smell, they can't taste.

48:32.980 --> 48:34.971
They're going to buy flour and fat.

48:35.660 --> 48:37.651
That's all you need to survive.

48:39.300 --> 48:41.291
Take a hit on that. Go on. Go on.

48:42.340 --> 48:43.773
Drink that.

48:43.820 --> 48:45.890
Now, that is damned expensive brandy.

48:45.980 --> 48:47.891
Damned, damned expensive.

48:47.980 --> 48:51.177
But you might as well
drink surgical spirit or sniff glue.

48:51.220 --> 48:53.211
It doesn't matter.

48:53.260 --> 48:54.773
Flour and fat.

48:54.820 --> 48:57.175
- And yet it does matter.
- There's no difference.

48:57.220 --> 48:58.858
No, I think you're wrong.

48:59.580 --> 49:01.252
Life goes on.

49:05.780 --> 49:07.179
[exhales heavily]

49:08.180 --> 49:09.932
They'll come back.

49:09.980 --> 49:12.130
People will ask each other
out to dinner again.

49:12.180 --> 49:14.899
They'll toast each other
while we take care of their needs.

49:14.940 --> 49:18.694
- Yeah, and serve them flour and fat.
- No, anything but flour and fat.

49:25.180 --> 49:26.818
We'll be all right.

49:49.180 --> 49:53.253
Slowly things return to normal
and life goes on.

49:58.260 --> 50:00.979
People do what they did before
as best they can.

50:12.100 --> 50:13.852
[crunches]

50:18.780 --> 50:20.771
[crunches]

50:22.140 --> 50:25.894
Within a few weeks,
taste becomes a distant memory.

50:26.260 --> 50:28.979
And different sensations
take its place.

50:29.020 --> 50:31.011
[bag pi pes Play]

50:44.100 --> 50:45.135
[sighs]

50:52.060 --> 50:55.689
In restaurants, it's all about offering
another person dinner,

Ietting yourself be waited on,

50:59.300 --> 51:02.849
Iistening to the trickle of wine
and the clink of glasses.

51:09.500 --> 51:12.060
" Not only has the food
received special attention,

51:12.140 --> 51:15.371
but also the temperature of the food
and its consistency.

51:15.420 --> 51:17.411
And we tried it all,

51:17.460 --> 51:20.372
from the freezing cold
to the scorching hot.

51:21.260 --> 51:23.933
It was dry, it was moist, it was crisp,

51:23.980 --> 51:29.179
it was spongy, it was crunchy
and it was all at the highest level,

51:29.260 --> 51:31.296
up to and including the dessert...

51:31.900 --> 51:36.337
a light pudding with caramelized knots
and a bright orange sorbet,

51:36.380 --> 51:40.453
and a dark blue... dark blue coulis
on blackberries and blackcurrant."

51:41.340 --> 51:43.092
Chew on that.

51:43.740 --> 51:45.093
Great.

51:45.180 --> 51:47.171
Life goes on.

51:54.860 --> 51:56.851
My dad let me shave him once.

51:58.380 --> 52:00.371
I was eight.

52:00.420 --> 52:02.980
I managed to do it
without a single scratch.

52:04.860 --> 52:06.851
I was very proud.

52:07.420 --> 52:09.411
And then...

52:09.460 --> 52:12.497
he went to the sink
and he shaved himself all over again

52:12.540 --> 52:14.531
as if I hadn't been there.

52:15.980 --> 52:17.971
I was devastated.

52:20.140 --> 52:22.131
Your turn.

52:26.180 --> 52:27.659
[laughs]

52:42.660 --> 52:44.890
Here, try. It's soft.

52:47.940 --> 52:49.931
- Mmm.
- Yeah?

52:49.980 --> 52:51.971
Mmm! Mmm.

52:56.500 --> 52:58.491
- Want to go dancing?
- Sure.

52:58.540 --> 52:59.893
- And get drunk?
- Sure.

52:59.940 --> 53:01.692
- And smoke cigarettes?
- Always.

53:01.740 --> 53:05.653
- There's still pleasures in the world, eh?
- Let's have them. All of them.

53:42.220 --> 53:44.211

Let's play a game, sailor.

53:47.260 --> 53:48.852
What game?

53:48.980 --> 53:50.971
It's called, "Make me special".

53:51.020 --> 53:53.011
What are the rules?

53:53.060 --> 53:54.539
Only one.

53:54.580 --> 53:56.571
Just tell me something.

53:56.620 --> 53:58.338
Something...?

53:58.380 --> 54:01.019
Something other people
don't know about you.

54:01.780 --> 54:04.169
- Something secret.
- Like what?

Unpoliced

My sister's got two kids
and sometimes I hate them.

54:14.860 --> 54:16.851
We drew uncertain breath

54:18.140 --> 54:20.495
The loss piled high unchecked

54:27.260 --> 54:29.251
I can't have children.

54:35.300 --> 54:37.256
My ovaries are crippled.

54:37.300 --> 54:39.291
My eggs are no good.

54:40.660 --> 54:42.696
Because of not eating.

54:46.140 --> 54:50.019
I pretend that I'm not that into them,
that I have an interesting job.

54:53.700 --> 54:55.258
Anyway...

54:57.500 --> 54:59.092
.. I can't have them.

55:05.260 --> 55:06.375
Your turn.

55:06.420 --> 55:08.411
No-one jailed us

55:11.660 --> 55:13.252
I had a girlfriend.

55:14.180 --> 55:15.932
You don't get this game, do you?

55:15.980 --> 55:18.938
No, we had erm... a wedding planned.

55:21.100 --> 55:22.977
And she got sick.

55:23.900 --> 55:25.891
She got really sick.

55:26.780 --> 55:30.932
You could smell there was something
wrong inside her, like something damp,

55:30.980 --> 55:32.971
something from a basement.

55:36.860 --> 55:38.851
I didn't stay with her.

55:39.700 --> 55:41.691
I didn't look after her, I ran away.

55:45.580 --> 55:47.571
I make myself go and visit her grave.

55:48.380 --> 55:51.577
At first it was once a week
and then maybe it was once a month

55:51.620 --> 55:53.019
and now less.

55:54.700 --> 55:56.691
I go there to feel guilty, you know?

55:58.300 --> 56:01.497
I thought I would feel guilty
for the rest of my life but...

56:03.500 --> 56:05.491
..actually it's starting to fade.

56:05.580 --> 56:07.571
And no song was sung

56:12.220 --> 56:14.609
- You're an arsehole?
- I am.

56:17.420 --> 56:20.218
No voice was raised

56:27.700 --> 56:29.691
It works.

56:31.020 --> 56:32.499
It works.

56:32.540 --> 56:34.496
You're making me yours.

56:34.540 --> 56:36.531
- I'm an arsehole.
- So am l.

No song was sung

57:06.700 --> 57:10.375
So this is the situation
here in Bangkok, Thailand.

57:10.420 --> 57:12.809
We call it Severe
Hearing Loss Syndrome,

57:12.900 --> 57:14.856
and we still do not
know much about it.

57:14.900 --> 57:16.891
Anger, rage, hate.

57:17.980 --> 57:19.698
And then they go deaf.

57:19.740 --> 57:21.890
And how does it spread?

57:26.260 --> 57:30.139
I can 't hear you very well but! do not
know what to do. Tell me what to do.

57:40.940 --> 57:42.931
You help us now!

57:42.980 --> 57:45.494
[sounds cuts in and out]

57:45.580 --> 57:47.377
.. help us now!

57:47.460 --> 57:49.769
.. send some help quick!

57:52.020 --> 57:54.011
Send some help now!

58:02.100 --> 58:04.091
I think it's OK to panic now.

58:05.700 --> 58:08.612
And that's basically
what the world does.

58:08.660 --> 58:10.696
Severe Hearing Loss Syndrome.

58:11.260 --> 58:13.251
Spreads from Thailand,

58:13.980 --> 58:16.130
across India to China,

58:16.180 --> 58:18.171
Russia and beyond.

58:54.500 --> 58:55.819
Rage.

58:55.860 --> 58:57.293
Anger.

58:58.340 --> 58:59.409
Hatred.

59:00.660 --> 59:02.651
And then the loss of another sense.

59:12.060 --> 59:14.779
All the unaffected can do is wait.

59:36.860 --> 59:38.452
Ta-da.

59:38.500 --> 59:42.129
- Can you still get film for those?
- Yeah, I got some from my uncle.

59:42.180 --> 59:44.171

59:44.220 --> 59:46.211
He was a collector.

59:46.260 --> 59:48.251
What did he collect?

59:49.060 --> 59:51.369
Polaroid cameras.

- Stephen.
- OK?

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:30.692
It's still valid.

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:33.459
Isolate the first ones,
get ready for loads more.

They're saying a child was born
in Berlin with all its senses.

- Somebody's infected on the third floor.

- They sealed it off.
- Who owns this restaurant?

- Me.
- You're shutting down.

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:56.612
- Give me a fucking break.
- Everywhere is shutting down.

01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:00.136
The council wants to hire you and
your staff to cook for the quarantined.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:02.774
Thousands are holed up in their homes,
sports arenas.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.856
They all need to be fed
three times a day.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.812
- Here's your menu and budget.
- Municipal food?

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.897
Other restaurants will do it.
If you don't want the job, just say no.

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.932
- That's all I need to hear, a no.
- Aye, all right. We'll do it.

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.858
Aye, very moving.
You'll have us in tears in a minute.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.377
- Fuck you.
- We're just trying to do our jobs.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.896
- We're trying to keep things working.
- Bouillon and fusilli?

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.773
- Make sure that pasta's al dente.
- Fat and flour.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.811
Fat and fucking flour.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.812
[both laugh]

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.339
MlCHAEL:
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.489
So all of a sudden, we're living together.

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.814
Yeah.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.532
Mr and Mrs Arsehole.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:27.729
Hmm.

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:32.695
We could play
"make me special" games.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.771
We could play at lovers.

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.571
And we could fuck.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.131
But you're just like all the others.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.459
Don't you think that you matter,
cos you don't.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.092
You're nothing.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.852
You are just passing time.

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.856
It's not difficult to understand.

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.652
It's just fucking.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:59.260
And eating. And fat and flour.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:05.300
You go out there, you lie down
on your back and spread your legs.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:09.819
Or take your profound conversations
and your emotions and fuck off.

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:14.010
You're just a pair of ears and a mouth,

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.692
an arsehole and a cunt.

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:18.812
It might surprise you to know this
but everyone else has that too.

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.900
A pair of ears and an arsehole.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.817
Fat and fucking flour.

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.851
Nothing special about this one,

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.891
except that she's infertile.

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.493
Fat and flour. Fat and flour!

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:33.531
Fat and fucking flour!

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.729
Fat and fucking flour!

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.010
[clattering and banging]

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.618
Fat and flour!

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.570
Fat, fat, fucking flour!

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.211
[yells]

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:04.370
Aargh! Oh, God!

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.411
[woman shouting]

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.531
[women screaming]

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.931
[screaming]

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.931
[man screams]

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:57.692
[yelling]

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:03.136
Let me in! Let me in!

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.171
Take me with you. Hey!

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:06.335
Hey!

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:08.371
Come on, let me in!

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:30.571
[soundless]

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.731
[soundless]

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:20.131
[tyres screech]

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.531
SUSAN:
Hello?

01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:49.377
Can you hear me?

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:52.339
Pardon?

01:08:55.859 --> 01:08:57.452
Seen anyone else?

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.731
[mobile phone buzzes]

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.171
MICHAEL:
I hope you can hear this

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.415
Whatever!
Said to you, I didn't mean.

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.291
It wasn't me.

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:31.371
It was the disease.

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:33.454
[clatter]

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.058
It was not you.

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.412
It was not you.

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.456
It's not me.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.536
It's nobody.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.979
Nothing.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.051
Nobody's here. Nobody.

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.294
No.

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.451
Disease. Which disease?

01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.493
Where is it?

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.491
Where are you hiding, you fucking cunt?

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.137
[soundless]

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:21.097
Where are you?

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.250
MICHAEL:
I need you to come back to me

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:26.252
- Take that... Nothing!
[clattering]

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.779
I need you to believe me

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.811
[Susan yells]

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.616
It's me.

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:35.656
Why? Why?

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.895
- Why?
- It's me asking you to come back.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.936
Why, Why, why, why, why?

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.976
Why, Why?

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.575
- I love you.
- You're all fucking liars!

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:49.652
[yells]

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.171
[soundless]

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.096
[soundless]

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.537
[soundless]

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.171
[soundless]

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.811
[soundless]

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.211
[soundless]

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.131
[soundless]

01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:32.174
There are two movements now.

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:36.412
There are the people who run through
the streets, grabbing all they can.

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:41.289
People who don 't believe in anything
but the end of the world.

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:47.020
Then there 's the other movement...

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:49.893
farmers going out to
milk their cows...

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:53.135
.. soldiers reporting for duty.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:04.212
Those who believe
that life will go on somehow...

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:08.815
.. or just don 't know
what else to do.

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:25.811
[fai nt vi brations]

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:56.129
[fai nt reverberations]

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:06.736
[fai nt th rum of vibrations]

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.935
People prepare for the worst...

01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:45.296
.. but hope for the best.

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:52.411
They concentrate on the things
that are important to them.

01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:54.451
[soundless]

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:08.771
All the things beyond fat and flour.

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:53.013
[soundless]

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:25.059
Once we thought of the ice age
as something that crept up...

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.614
glaciers slowly spreading...

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:30.049
temperatures gradually dropping.

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:38.249
But recently a number of intact
mammoths have been discovered

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.973
with stomachs full of
undigested grass.

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:46.697
The cold must have hit them
like a blow from a club.

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.496
[deep rumbling]

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:00.811
That's how the darkness
descends upon the world.

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.330
But first the shining moments.

01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:35.737
A shared flinching
of the brain 's temporal lobe.

01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:06.778
A profound appreciation
of what it means to be alive.

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:22.411
But most of all, a shared urge
to reach out to one another.

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:29.489
To offer warmth...

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:34.255
.. understanding...

01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:38.694
.. acceptance...

01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:43.095
.. forgiveness...

01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:49.091
.. Iove.

01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:15.011
[soundless]

01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:03.854
It's dark now...

01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:06.135
but they feel each other's breath...

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:08.330
and they know all they need to know.

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:11.689
They kiss...

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:14.573
and they feel each other's tears
on their cheeks.

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.890
And if there had been
anybody left to see them,

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:23.331
then they would look like normal lovers
caressing each other's faces...

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:26.136
.. bodies close together...

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.011
eyes closed...

01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:31.169
.. oblivious to the
world around them.

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.290
Because that is how life goes on.

01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:37.611
Like that.
