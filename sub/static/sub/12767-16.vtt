07:17.083 --> 07:18.959

07:19.000 --> 07:20.959
I HAD THIS LIST OF NAMES.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.959
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH ONE
SHE WOULD BE.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.709
I WANTED TO MEET HER FIRST.
I HAD SARAH AND LILY

07:25.750 --> 07:27.709
AND ELLORY,
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS SO PRETTY--

07:27.750 --> 07:30.250
I HAD NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE,
BUT I READ IT IN A BOOK--

07:30.291 --> 07:31.875
AND GRACE.

07:31.917 --> 07:33.875
AND IT WAS A DAY AND A HALF
OF LABOR AND PUSHING,

07:33.917 --> 07:35.917
AND I DID IT WITH NO DRUGS
OR ANYTHING.

07:35.959 --> 07:38.166
AND--AND I PUSHED AND I PUSHED,
BUT SHE WAS STUCK.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.166
SHE'S STUBBORN. SHE'S--
SHE'S SO... STUBBORN.

07:40.208 --> 07:42.166
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO COME OUT.

07:42.208 --> 07:45.041
THE DOCTOR EVEN GOT A VACUUM,
BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO COME.

07:45.083 --> 07:48.083
SHE WAS SUCH A GOOD BABY
WHEN SHE WAS ON THE INSIDE.

07:48.125 --> 07:51.083
SHE WAS SUCH A GOOD BABY, BUT I
COULDN'T USE ANY OF THE NAMES

07:51.125 --> 07:54.041
BECAUSE WHEN SHE CAME OUT,
THEY--THEY DIDN'T FIT.

07:54.083 --> 07:57.333
SO MY HUSBAND NAMED HER CYNTHIA.
HE NAMED HER, BUT I LOVE HER.

07:57.375 --> 08:00.083
OF COURSE YOU DO.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.959
I REALLY LOVE HER.
WHERE IS SHE?
SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.792
OH.
SHE'S--SHE'S RIGHT HERE,
BUT I-I THINK DR. FREEDMAN

08:05.834 --> 08:08.291
IS JUST GONNA, UH,
RUN A FEW MORE TESTS.

08:08.333 --> 08:11.083
WE JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW.
SHE--SHE'S NOT OKAY?
SHE--SHE'S NOT OKAY?

08:11.125 --> 08:14.500
SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S FINE.
WE'RE JUST GONNA MAKE SURE.

08:14.542 --> 08:16.625
WE'RE GONNA RUN
A FEW MORE TESTS.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.917
SO, UH, DR. FREEDMAN,
YOU CAN GO WITH CYNTHIA,

08:18.959 --> 08:21.291
AND I'LL STAY WITH RACHEL.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.959

08:24.959 --> 08:27.291
YOU'RE REALLY TIRED,
AREN'T YOU?

08:27.333 --> 08:30.917

AHH.

08:44.083 --> 08:46.458
HE OUGHT TO BE HAPPY.
HE'S ON MORPHINE.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.458
HE SAYS THAT HIS VISION
IS BLURRY...
MM-HMM.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.667
AND HE WOULD LIKE YOU TO RUN
ANOTHER C.T.

08:50.709 --> 08:52.375
NO.
NO?

08:52.417 --> 08:54.041
YOUR BROTHER'S AN ASS.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.875
HIS VISION
IS PROBABLY IMPAIRED

08:55.917 --> 08:57.875
BECAUSE HE CAN'T SEE PAST
HIS OWN EGO.

08:57.917 --> 09:00.959

FINE. HE DOESN'T NEED A C.T.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.333

09:08.417 --> 09:10.625
I'M GONNA SPEAK TO YOU
LIKE ONE.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.625
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?
WHAT'S WRONG?

09:12.667 --> 09:14.625
I OPERATED ON A PREGNANT WOMAN
EARLIER TONIGHT.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.792
NOW SHE CAN'T BREATHE.
DID SHE TOSS A P.E.?

09:16.834 --> 09:19.041
NOPE. THE SCAN'S NEGATIVE.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.417
I NICKED HER ANEURYSM
DURING SURGERY.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.792
I REPAIRED IT PERFECTLY.

09:23.834 --> 09:25.834
I'VE JUST NEVER SEEN A POST-OP
COMPLICATION LIKE THIS.

09:25.875 --> 09:29.041
I GOT A C.T.,
A CHEST X-RAY, ECHO.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.375
DID YOU CHECK THE BABY?
I CHECKED THE F.H.T.s.
THEY WERE FINE.

09:31.417 --> 09:32.875
YOU NEED TO RUN A DOPPLER.
IT'S THE MOTHER
WHO CAN'T BREATHE.

09:32.917 --> 09:35.041
NO, NO. TRUST ME ON THIS, DEREK.
YOU NEED TO RUN A DOPPLER.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.000
DO IT NOW.
THE BABY COULD BE THE PROBLEM.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.375
(clears throat)
EXCUSE ME.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.625
COULD SOMEONE TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON, PLEASE?

09:46.667 --> 09:48.917
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOUR WIFE
IS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING

09:48.959 --> 09:52.041
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE BABY.
THE-THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE BABY?

09:52.083 --> 09:55.041
SOMETIMES IT CAN HAPPEN IF--
NO. MY WIFE WAS FINE
WHEN WE WALKED IN HERE.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.542
NOW SHE CAN'T BREATHE
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME

09:57.583 --> 10:00.041
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE BABY?

10:00.083 --> 10:03.041
MY WIFE WAS FINE.
SHE WAS FINE.
SHE WASN'T FINE. SHE RAN OVER
YOU WITH HER CAR

10:03.083 --> 10:05.875
AND THEN SHE HAD A SEIZURE.
SHE WASN'T FINE.
SHE'S MIRRORING.

10:05.917 --> 10:08.041
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
MIRROR SYNDROME.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.083
IT'S RARE, BUT SOMETIMES
IF THE BABY IS SICK IN UTERO,

10:10.125 --> 10:12.542
THE MOTHER WILL MIRROR
ITS SYMPTOMS.
SO IT'S PSYCHOLOGICAL?

10:12.583 --> 10:15.041
MNH-MNH.
NO, NO. THE SYMPTOMS
ARE VERY REAL.

10:15.083 --> 10:17.917
AND IN THIS CASE, THE BABY
IS ANEMIC, AND THE ANEMIA

10:17.959 --> 10:20.542
IS CAUSING CONGESTIVE HEART
FAILURE IN BOTH OF THEM.
WHAT CAN WE DO?

10:20.583 --> 10:24.959
YOU NEED TO GET A BLOOD TYPE
AND DO AN ANTIBODY SCREEN.
WHAT IF ONE OF THEM
IS POSITIVE?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
LET'S JUST TAKE IT
A STEP AT A TIME.

10:29.917 --> 10:32.458
YOU WANT
TO PUT NEEDLES IN ME?
WELL, I'D PREFER

10:32.500 --> 10:35.583
YOU LET ME GIVE YOU
SOME PILLS TO CALM YOU DOWN,

10:35.625 --> 10:37.583
BUT YOU SAID--
YEAH, NO. I'M--
I'M STILL NURSING.

10:37.625 --> 10:40.291
SO I-I JUST--I DON'T WANT
TO HURT THE BABY.

10:40.333 --> 10:44.125
I DON'T WANT TO HURT MY BABY.
RIGHT. SO THAT'S WHY DR. WILDER
IS GONNA USE THE NEEDLES

10:44.166 --> 10:45.750
TO HELP YOU GET SOME REST.

10:45.792 --> 10:48.041
HE'S VERY GOOD.
WHAT ABOUT CINDY?

10:48.083 --> 10:49.875
SHE'S FINE. SHE'S FINE.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.959
WE'RE RUNNING THE TESTS.
THE NURSES ARE WITH HER.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.041
WE--WE HAVE BABIES HERE
ALL THE TIME. (chuckles)

10:54.083 --> 10:56.041
GOD, YOU... YOU'RE SO KIND.

10:56.083 --> 10:59.583
JUST THANK YOU
FOR BEING SO KIND.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.083
I'M--I'M SORRY.

11:01.125 --> 11:03.959
(chuckles) JUST...
UGH.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.500
(gasps) OOH.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.500
SORRY.
IT'S OKAY, RACHEL.
JUST LIE RIGHT DOWN.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.917
OKAY.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.291
YOU KNOW, POSTPARTUM HORMONES
ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.500
USUALLY THEY HAVE
A CALMING EFFECT.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.792
BUT SOMETIMES THE BODY CHEMISTRY
GOES A LITTLE HAYWIRE,

11:15.834 --> 11:18.000
AND THEY CAN REALLY AMP YOU UP,
KEEP YOU FROM SLEEPING.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.000
WHAT ACUPUNCTURE DOES
IS TARGET SPECIFIC POINTS

11:20.041 --> 11:21.792
TO PUT YOUR BODY
BACK IN BALANCE.

11:21.834 --> 11:23.792
IT RELEASES ENDORPHINS,
WHICH COUNTER THE HORMONES.

11:23.834 --> 11:26.709
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A NATURAL SEDATIVE.
THE BABY DOESN'T SLEEP,
NOT AT NIGHT.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.709
SHE DOESN'T SLEEP,
AND THE REFRIGERATOR'S BROKEN.

11:28.750 --> 11:31.208
IT SOUNDS LIKE A DYING PIGEON,
LIKE... (makes gurgling sound),

11:31.250 --> 11:35.041
(chuckles) LIKE A DYING PIGEON,
MY HUSBAND SAYS.

11:35.083 --> 11:37.542
AND THEN YOU GET SO TIRED
OF FEELING SO TIRED,

11:37.583 --> 11:40.250
SO YOU JUST DRINK MORE COFFEE,
AND THEN THE BABY FALLS ASLEEP,

11:40.291 --> 11:41.875
AND YOU CAN'T SLEEP ANYWAY.

11:41.917 --> 11:44.041
AND THEN LAST NIGHT I WAS UP--
I WAS, UH, HOLDING THE BABY.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.041
I WAS NURSING HER,
AND I LEFT THE TV ON,

11:46.083 --> 11:48.041
AND THERE WERE
ALL THESE INFOMERCIALS

11:48.083 --> 11:50.417
THAT YOU WOULD NEVER SEE IF YOU
ONLY WATCH TV DURING THE DAY--

11:50.458 --> 11:52.041
ALL THESE INFOMERCIALS

11:52.083 --> 11:54.208
ABOUT HOW TO BECOME
A REFRIGERATOR REPAIRMAN.

11:54.250 --> 11:57.041
AND THEN SHE FELL ASLEEP ON
MY BOOB, AND I WAS DOZING OFF,

11:57.083 --> 11:59.041
AND I WAS FINALLY,
FINALLY SLEEPING,

11:59.083 --> 12:01.041
AND THEN THE REFRIGERATOR DID
THAT... (makes gurgling sound),

12:01.083 --> 12:03.166
AND I THOUGHT, SOMEONE SHOULD
PUT THAT REFRIGERATOR

12:03.208 --> 12:06.041
OUT OF ITS GODFORSAKEN MISERY--
THAT SMELLS NICE.

12:06.083 --> 12:08.583
WHATEVER YOU'RE--YOU'RE BURNING,
IT--IT SMELLS NICE.

12:08.625 --> 12:11.041
(Archer)
WHERE THE HELL IS ADDISON?

12:11.083 --> 12:15.041
WHERE IS THAT HACK OF
A BROTHER-IN-LAW OF MINE?

12:15.083 --> 12:18.041
DOES HE NOT WANT TO DO
A POST-OP EXAM?

12:18.083 --> 12:20.792
I AM HIS HIGHEST-PROFILE CASE
IN YEARS.
DR. SHEPHERD HAS
ANOTHER COMPLICATED CASE,

12:20.834 --> 12:23.041
AND ADDISON IS CONSULTING.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.667
IT'S A WOMAN
WHO'S MIRRORING--

12:24.709 --> 12:27.041
OH, I'M DYING... ALONE.

12:27.083 --> 12:29.458
THE TRIALS OF
SEATTLE'S WRETCHED REFUSE

12:29.500 --> 12:32.166
DO NOT INTEREST ME.
ARCHER, YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

12:32.208 --> 12:35.000

12:35.041 --> 12:38.250

12:42.750 --> 12:44.208

12:44.250 --> 12:47.208

I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.208
WELL, IT'S NOT MY THEORY.
IT'S ADDISON'S.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.834

12:50.875 --> 12:53.834

IT'S NOT EMOTIONAL.

I ALWAYS LIKED ADDISON.

13:01.792 --> 13:04.959
I DON'T ALWAYS LIKE EVERYBODY,
BUT I ALWAYS LIKED HER.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.250
SHE SMELLS NICE, SHE'S POLITE
AND SHE SAVES BABIES.

13:08.291 --> 13:10.959
SO WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BROTHER?
(laughs)

13:11.000 --> 13:13.792
WAS HE LOST AT BIRTH,
RAISED BY WOLVES?
HE'S NOT ALWAYS SUCH AN ASS.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.917
YEAH, HE IS.

13:47.375 --> 13:50.291

17:43.208 --> 17:44.792
AND SHE NEEDS YOU,

17:44.834 --> 17:47.792
BUT, SWEETIE, YOU'RE NOT
ANY GOOD TO HER RIGHT NOW.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.875
YOU NEED TO SLEEP, OKAY?
(Rachel crying)

17:49.917 --> 17:52.166
SO WHY DON'T YOU LET US
TAKE CARE OF HER WHILE YOU'RE--

17:52.208 --> 17:54.625
SHE WAS IN THE TUB
AND SHE WAS CRYING.

17:54.667 --> 17:57.583
SHE'S ALWAYS CRYING,
AND I WAS ASKING HER TO STOP.
(Cindy continues crying)

17:57.625 --> 18:00.000
I JUST WANTED HER
TO STOP CRYING.

18:00.041 --> 18:02.041
AND SHE SLIPPED,
AND HER HEAD WENT UNDER,

18:02.083 --> 18:04.041
AND I-I REACHED FOR HER...
(sobs)

18:04.083 --> 18:05.792
AND THEN...

18:05.834 --> 18:09.041
I HELD HER DOWN.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.041
(Cindy continues crying)

18:11.083 --> 18:14.041
AND IT WAS QUIET,
AND I JUST KEPT THINKING,

18:14.083 --> 18:16.834
ANDREW WON'T BE HOME
UNTIL DINNER,

18:16.875 --> 18:19.083
AND NO ONE WOULD KNOW
UNTIL DINNER,

18:19.125 --> 18:20.709
AND I COULD...

18:20.750 --> 18:26.083
I-I COULD FINALLY GET
A COUPLE OF HOURS OF SLEEP.

18:26.125 --> 18:28.041
(Cindy continues crying)

18:28.083 --> 18:32.041
♪♪♪

18:32.083 --> 18:34.000
(sobbing)

18:38.125 --> 18:39.709
(footsteps approach)

18:39.750 --> 18:41.083
(door opens)

18:41.125 --> 18:42.417
HEY.

18:42.458 --> 18:46.000
SO ARCHER IS GONNA GET
ANOTHER C.T., JUST TO BE SURE.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.041
YEAH, I KNOW. THAT'S GOOD.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.041
YOU OKAY?

18:51.083 --> 18:54.166
AM I CRAZY, JUMPING IN
SO FAST WITH ARCHER?

18:56.041 --> 18:58.375
YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO CARE ABOUT.
HE HAS YOU.

18:58.417 --> 19:01.250
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

19:01.291 --> 19:02.792
(sighs)

19:02.834 --> 19:05.041
WHAT?

19:05.083 --> 19:09.250
ALEX, YOU, ARCHER,
MARK, SAM--

19:09.291 --> 19:11.709
YOU ALL HAVE NEW PEOPLE.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.458
I AM TREATING A PATIENT
WHO RAN OVER HER HUSBAND

19:14.500 --> 19:17.041
WITH A CAR,
AND HE STILL LOVES HER.
WH--

19:17.083 --> 19:20.041
DEREK IS PROPOSING--
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE RING?

19:20.083 --> 19:21.917
NO. WHAT RING?

19:21.959 --> 19:24.041
NO. FORGET IT.

19:24.083 --> 19:26.709
YOU HAVE TWO. I HAVE NONE.
NO FAIR.
NO. SAM? PLEASE.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.834
IT'S AN ADORABLE THEORY,
BUT IT DOES NOT HOLD WATER.

19:29.875 --> 19:32.333
YEAH, WELL, I'D LAP IT UP
IF I WERE YOU.

19:32.375 --> 19:35.083
I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY HAVING
ASTHMA ATTACKS OVER ME.
HEY! I'M OVER HER.

19:35.125 --> 19:38.125
THIS IS NOT A PANIC ATTACK.
THIS IS ASTHMA.

19:38.166 --> 19:39.959
IT'S PHYSIOLOGICAL
NOT EMOTIONAL.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.625
I'M OVER YOU.

19:41.667 --> 19:44.083
I'M HERE FOR FRIENDS.
YOU ARE A FRIEND.

19:44.125 --> 19:46.542
BUT I'M OVER YOU, OKAY?
I'M OVER YOU.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.041
(gasps)

19:48.083 --> 19:50.291
(wheezes)

19:50.333 --> 19:51.500
(mutters)

19:51.542 --> 19:52.750
HERE.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.959
SHUT UP.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.792
(inhales deeply)

19:56.834 --> 20:00.041
KAREV, WHY HAVEN'T I SEEN
JEN'S LAB RESULTS?

20:00.083 --> 20:04.041
DR. MONTGOMERY WANTED
TO RUN ANOTHER ROUND OF--
I NEVER SAW THE FIRST ROUND.

20:04.083 --> 20:07.041
HEY. SAM'S NOT RESPONDING
TO HIS MEDS. IS DR. BAILEY--
WHAT DID THE PRELIMINARY
LAB RESULTS SAY

20:07.083 --> 20:09.041
ABOUT JEN'S CONDITION?
THEY WERE INCONCLUSIVE.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.166
THAT'S WHY I ORDERED
A REPEAT.
LOOK,
IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.458
EITHER THE BABY'S GONNA DIE
OR HE'S NOT.

20:13.500 --> 20:17.041
EITHER THE MOTHER'S GONNA DIE
OR SHE'S NOT.
YEAH, WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT?

20:17.083 --> 20:20.041
LOOK, I HAVE BEEN UP
ALL NIGHT, TOO,

20:20.083 --> 20:22.458
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU
YELLING AT--
MY PATIENT! MY PATIENT.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.000
LET ME KNOW WHEN
THE DAMN TEST RESULTS GET IN.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.041
OH. HEY, CHARLOTTE.

20:29.083 --> 20:32.000
HELLO, VIOLET.

20:32.041 --> 20:33.709
(laughs)

20:33.750 --> 20:35.291
WHAT WAS THAT?

20:35.333 --> 20:38.041
THAT WAS WE'RE HAVING LUNCH,
THE THREE OF US.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.917
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR.

20:42.834 --> 20:46.041
OKAY.

20:46.083 --> 20:48.041
HOW'S RACHEL?

20:48.083 --> 20:50.792
SHE'S STABLE.
I SEDATED HER WITH BENZOS,

20:50.834 --> 20:53.000
GOT HER STARTED ON
AN ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC.

20:53.041 --> 20:55.000
SHE'LL HAVE TO
STOP BREAST-FEEDING,

20:55.041 --> 20:57.750
WHICH IS NOT IDEAL,
BUT...

21:00.250 --> 21:03.041
(whispering)
WHAT IF MINE DOESN'T SLEEP?

21:03.083 --> 21:05.291
(whispers) SHE'LL SLEEP.
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T?

21:05.333 --> 21:08.458
(normal voice)
THEN I WILL STAY UP WITH HER

21:08.500 --> 21:11.041
WHILE YOU SLEEP.
WHAT IF I GO CRAZY?

21:11.083 --> 21:14.041
WHAT IF I GET POSTPARTUM
PSYCHOSIS AND DEPRESSION?

21:14.083 --> 21:16.208
WHAT IF I TRY TO HURT
THE BABY?

21:16.250 --> 21:18.750
OR WHAT I IF I JUST HAVE
A TERRIBLE CHILD? SERIOUSLY.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.834
WHAT IF I'M THE ONE
THAT GIVES BIRTH

21:20.875 --> 21:24.041
TO THE SOCIOPATH WHO TRIES
TO BURN THE HIGH SCHOOL DOWN?

21:24.083 --> 21:26.041
OR WHAT IF I JUST SCREW UP
IN SO MANY WAYS

21:26.083 --> 21:28.667
THAT NO AMOUNT OF THERAPY
CAN EVER REPAIR THE DAMAGE

21:28.709 --> 21:31.041
THAT I DO TO THAT POOR CHILD?
VIOLET?

21:31.083 --> 21:32.458
YES.
STOP.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.000
OKAY.
POSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS
IS VERY RARE.

21:35.041 --> 21:36.709
THIS ISN'T NORMAL.

21:38.417 --> 21:41.083
WHAT IF MINE DOESN'T SLEEP?

21:43.917 --> 21:46.500
OH. I'M... SORRY.

21:46.542 --> 21:48.500
I'M AFRAID
YOU'LL HAVE TO STEP OUT.

21:48.542 --> 21:50.959
UH, NO, I'M A PHYSICIAN,
AND I'M HIS GIRLFRIEND.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.333
YOU'RE NOT HIS PHYSICIAN,
AND AS FOR GIRLFRIEND,

21:53.375 --> 21:55.041
WASHINGTON STATE MEDICAL CODE

21:55.083 --> 21:57.333
DOESN'T CONSIDER THAT
A LEGAL ROLE.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.959
UH, FINE.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.041
UH, CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME
SOME IDEA

22:01.083 --> 22:02.959
OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR SAM?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.041
HE'S NOT RESPONDING
TO THE MEDS.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.583
I'M HIS WIFE.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.709
EX. AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THIS ONE'S GIRLFRIEND.

22:08.750 --> 22:12.041
ARE YOU LIKE THIS WITH EVERYONE,
OR AM I JUST SPECIAL?

22:12.083 --> 22:14.500
FINE. STAY.
BUT NO QUESTIONS.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.041
POST-OP C.T.,
EVERYTHING OKAY?

22:17.083 --> 22:18.041
(groans)

22:18.083 --> 22:21.083
I DON'T KNOW.

22:21.125 --> 22:24.083
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD?

22:24.125 --> 22:27.083
YOU, WHO HAS NEVER WORN FLANNEL
A DAY IN YOUR LIFE,

22:27.125 --> 22:28.709
LIVING IN SEATTLE

22:28.750 --> 22:31.041
AND HAVING
A SEMI-INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP

22:31.083 --> 22:34.792
WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND'S
ALMOST SISTER.
(chuckles)
I WAS GONNA SAY IT'S WEIRD

22:34.834 --> 22:37.792
THAT I DISLIKE ARCHER
AS MUCH AS I DO,

22:37.834 --> 22:39.834
AND SOMEHOW THIS
YOU-AND-ARCHER THING

22:39.875 --> 22:41.667
GIVES ME HOPE.

22:41.709 --> 22:42.875
LEXIE.

22:42.917 --> 22:44.834
THAT THE SISTER?

22:44.875 --> 22:46.834
YEAH, SHE'S A GOOD GIRL.

22:46.875 --> 22:48.208
SHE'S A NICE GIRL--

22:48.250 --> 22:50.333
WELL-RAISED, KIND
AND UNDERSTANDING, SANE.

22:50.375 --> 22:51.959
SHE'S LIKE YOU.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.125
SO IF YOU CAN FIND
HAPPINESS WITH ARCHER,

22:54.166 --> 22:57.542
I'M THINKING,
MAYBE THERE'S HOPE.
YOU REALLY THINK
THIS THING IS REAL

22:57.583 --> 23:00.291
BETWEEN YOU
AND THIS LITTLE GIRL?

23:00.333 --> 23:03.041
I'M AFRAID TO HURT HER.

23:03.083 --> 23:05.375
YOU THINK ARCHER'S
GONNA HURT ME?

23:05.417 --> 23:06.917
I HOPE NOT.

23:06.959 --> 23:10.000
LIKE I SAID,
YOU TWO GIVE ME HOPE.

23:13.083 --> 23:15.041
OKAY, UH, GIVE HER
ANOTHER 40 OFF FUROSEMIDE

23:15.083 --> 23:17.041
AND GET A REPEAT CHEST.

23:17.083 --> 23:18.583
(Derek) WHAT DO YOU GOT?

23:18.625 --> 23:20.583
I'VE BEEN HOPING. I...
I RAN A THOUSAND TESTS,

23:20.625 --> 23:22.583
AND I DIDN'T TELL YOU
THE RESULTS

23:22.625 --> 23:24.583
'CAUSE I WAS HOPING
I WAS WRONG,

23:24.625 --> 23:26.583
BUT THE BABY
IS SEVERELY ANEMIC.

23:26.625 --> 23:28.041
HIS HEART'S FAILING.

23:28.083 --> 23:30.583
MOST LIKELY IT'S CAUSED BY
A KELL ANTIGEN INCOMPATIBILITY

23:30.625 --> 23:32.583
IN THE BLOOD YOU GAVE JEN
DURING SURGERY.

23:32.625 --> 23:34.041
IT'S CAUSING A REACTION

23:34.083 --> 23:35.583
THAT'S DESTROYING
THE BABY'S BLOOD.

23:35.625 --> 23:37.041
I'M... I'M SO SORRY.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.583
DON'T BE SORRY. JUST TELL ME
HOW WE CAN FIX IT.

23:39.625 --> 23:41.583
WELL, I MEAN,
IN AN IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCE,

23:41.625 --> 23:43.583
I'D DO AN IN UTERO
BLOOD TRANSFUSION,

23:43.625 --> 23:45.583
BUT THIS ISN'T
AN IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCE.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.625
JEN IS DETERIORATING RAPIDLY.
SHE COULD ARREST AT ANY MINUTE,

23:48.667 --> 23:51.291
AND THE PRIORITY
HAS GOTTA BE THE MOTHER.
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

23:51.333 --> 23:54.291
I'M SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO
GET THE BABY OUT.
THE BABY'S 24 WEEKS.
THE ODDS OF HIM SURVIVING--

23:54.333 --> 23:57.417
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT IF I
TAKE HIM OUT, SHE LIVES.

23:57.458 --> 23:59.750
IF WE DON'T,
WE RISK LOSING THEM BOTH.

24:04.458 --> 24:06.041
NO. HE'S NOT READY.

24:06.083 --> 24:08.041
HE'S TOO LITTLE.
HE'S NOT READY.

24:08.083 --> 24:10.041
JEN, I KNOW
THAT THIS IS SCARY,

24:10.083 --> 24:13.041
BUT I'M GONNA DO
EVERYTHING THAT--
LOOK, MY BOOK SAYS HE CAN LIVE
IF WE GET HIM TO 26 WEEKS.

24:13.083 --> 24:15.041
THAT'S IN TWO WEEKS.
SO LET ME JUST--

24:15.083 --> 24:18.041
I CAN STAY IN THE HOSPITAL
AND BE ON OXYGEN

24:18.083 --> 24:21.917
AND KEEP HIM IN
FOR TWO MORE WEEKS.
JEN, YOUR BABY IS IN
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.

24:21.959 --> 24:24.291
SO ARE YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE
TWO MORE WEEKS.

24:24.333 --> 24:26.291
NO. NO.
YOU'RE NOT TAKING HIM OUT.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.291
HE'S TOO LITTLE.
HE'S TOO LITTLE.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.166
WOULD HE SURVIVE?

24:30.208 --> 24:33.375
IF YOU TAKE HIM OUT,
WILL HE--
HE ABSOLUTELY COULD SURVIVE.

24:33.417 --> 24:36.250
I'VE DELIVERED BABIES THAT ARE
ONE TO TWO DAYS YOUNGER EVEN

24:36.291 --> 24:38.458
THAT HAVE SURVIVED.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.083
I'VE ALSO LOST BABIES
THAT ARE SEVERAL WEEKS OLDER.

24:41.125 --> 24:43.917
IT'S JUST A RISK.
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU.

24:43.959 --> 24:47.750
BUT I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
THAT I CAN TO SAVE HIM.
PLEASE TELL ME
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

24:47.792 --> 24:49.875
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE
YOU CAN DO, RIGHT?

24:49.917 --> 24:51.709
THERE'S NO OTHER OPTIONS?

24:51.750 --> 24:54.500
THERE IS
AN IN UTERO PROCEDURE.

24:54.542 --> 24:58.041
WAIT? WHAT IS THAT?
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION HERE.

24:58.083 --> 25:00.166
SHE'S STRONG--
DR. SHEPHERD...

25:00.208 --> 25:03.125
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION HERE.
THE RISK IS FAR TOO HIGH.

25:03.166 --> 25:06.125
I'M SORRY.
YOU HAVE TO DO IT.
YOU HAVE TO FIX HIM.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.542
IT'S YOUR JOB TO FIX HIM.
(sniffles)

25:08.583 --> 25:10.917
JEN, LET ME BE CLEAR--
IF WE DO THIS

25:10.959 --> 25:12.500
AND YOUR
HEART CONDITION WORSENS

25:12.542 --> 25:14.542
OR YOU GET
ANOTHER BRAIN BLEED,

25:14.583 --> 25:17.083
BOTH YOU AND THE BABY
COULD DIE.

25:17.125 --> 25:19.041
JEN--
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

25:19.083 --> 25:21.417
JEN--
NO, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

25:21.458 --> 25:23.834
PLEASE. JUST DO THE THING
WHERE YOU LEAVE HIM IN.

25:23.875 --> 25:26.417
THAT'S WHAT I CHOOSE.
LEAVE HIM IN.

25:26.458 --> 25:29.458
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:31.000 --> 25:32.542
YOU CORNERED ME.

25:32.583 --> 25:35.041
I COME IN AND SAY WE HAVE TO
DELIVER THAT BABY,

25:35.083 --> 25:37.041
AND THEN YOU RIDE IN
ON A WHITE HORSE

25:37.083 --> 25:39.542
OFFERING SOME IN UTERO PROCEDURE
THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

25:39.583 --> 25:42.041
IS IT GONNA KILL HER
OR IS THERE A CHANCE?
I DON'T KNOW, DEREK.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.041
THOSE ARE ODDS
I DON'T LIKE TO EVALUATE

25:44.083 --> 25:47.041
IN FRONT OF A WEEPING MOTHER
CLUTCHING HER BELLY.
EVALUATE IT NOW.

25:47.083 --> 25:49.041
RUN SOME TESTS.
FIGURE IT OUT.

25:49.083 --> 25:52.041
JUST KEEP THE BABY ALIVE,
AND I WILL KEEP HER ALIVE.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.583
(sighs)

25:55.667 --> 25:57.792
(man) HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?

25:57.834 --> 26:00.291
SHE'S--
(door closes)

26:00.333 --> 26:02.000
SHE LOVES THIS BABY.

26:02.041 --> 26:04.917
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
HOW DID I LET IT HAPPEN?

26:04.959 --> 26:06.917
HOW DID I MISS IT?

26:06.959 --> 26:08.917
POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
IS VERY INSIDIOUS.

26:08.959 --> 26:11.041
IT--IT SNEAKS UP ON YOU,
SO IT CAN BE TRIGGERED

26:11.083 --> 26:13.375
BY SLEEP DEPRIVATION,

26:13.417 --> 26:16.166
THEN THE DEPRESSION
MAKES IT HARDER TO SLEEP.

26:16.208 --> 26:19.917
IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE, AND THEN
WHEN THERE'S PSYCHOSIS--
I'M TIRED, TOO.
I AM SO TIRED.

26:19.959 --> 26:22.375
BUT I COULDN'T...
I COULDN'T...

26:22.417 --> 26:25.041
HOW COULD SHE DO THIS?

26:25.083 --> 26:27.250
WELL, YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT IN HER BODY.

26:27.291 --> 26:30.041
YOU CAN'T EXPERIENCE--
IT ISN'T ANYTHING
YOU MISSED, ANDREW.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.041
YOU'RE THE DAD.
YOU'RE ON THE OUTSIDE.

26:32.083 --> 26:35.417
YOU'RE AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN BE,
BUT YOU ARE ON THE OUTSIDE.

26:35.458 --> 26:39.041
AND IF SHE DOESN'T
LET YOU IN...

26:39.083 --> 26:42.417
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU
WHAT SHE WAS FEELING.

26:42.458 --> 26:45.041
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT.

26:45.083 --> 26:48.041
UM, RACHEL WANTS TO SEE CINDY.
