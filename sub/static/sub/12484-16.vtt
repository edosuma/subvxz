Keep squishing, guys!

00:10.670 --> 00:11.470
Remember, we are making grape juice

00:11.500 --> 00:14.910
purely as an educational exercise.

00:14.940 --> 00:17.720
Yeah, we're learning
that Principal Skidmore

00:17.750 --> 00:18.890
is too cheap to buy us juice.

00:20.990 --> 00:21.980
I gotta say,

00:22.020 --> 00:24.720
this is really soothing my athlete's foot.

00:27.950 --> 00:30.880
I wonder if it will work on my hemorrhoids.

00:30.920 --> 00:31.790
No! No!

00:34.530 --> 00:36.900
Hey, guys, big news!

00:36.930 --> 00:39.730
I am holding an open house Thursday

00:39.760 --> 00:41.770
for prospective Ants and their parents.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.970
I need somebody to give a speech
about the A.N.T. Program.

00:46.010 --> 00:48.810
You mean explain how
innocent 11-year-olds

00:48.840 --> 00:50.680
have been robbed of their
youth by their principal,

00:50.710 --> 00:53.920
a power-hungry tyrant?

00:53.950 --> 00:55.790
You take that back or I
will tear out your tongue

00:55.820 --> 00:57.050
and feed it to my raven!

00:59.020 --> 01:01.920
Chyna, you'll give the speech.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.990
So get to work.
I'm counting on you.

01:04.019 --> 01:05.620
I'll do whatever you want.

01:05.660 --> 01:06.890
Please don't take my tongue.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.930
Guys, stomp faster.
Like this!

01:12.960 --> 01:15.730
Ow! Ow!

01:15.770 --> 01:18.670
I can't...
Ow! Ow! Stop! Oh, stop!

01:26.810 --> 01:28.710
Wow. You can
really taste the foot.

02:25.730 --> 02:28.700
Cameron, did you download a boxing app

02:28.740 --> 02:30.000
and punch my A.N.T. Pad?

02:31.770 --> 02:35.640
How dare you something like that?

02:35.680 --> 02:38.040
You have no evidence.
None whatsoever.

02:38.950 --> 02:42.650
Your knuckles are bandaged.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.950
That's not from the screen.

02:43.980 --> 02:46.820
I got this

02:46.850 --> 02:50.990
breaking out of a giant snow globe,

02:51.020 --> 02:55.830
where I was being evil gift shop owner.

02:55.860 --> 02:57.800
If you were really trapped in a snow globe,

02:57.830 --> 03:00.030
you would be wet
fake sparkles. Little.

03:00.070 --> 03:02.000
And I know, because it happened to Gibson.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.670
Let me out of here!

03:08.010 --> 03:09.680
My speech was on here!

03:09.710 --> 03:11.980
You're going to pay for this!

03:12.010 --> 03:13.880
What are you going to do?

03:13.910 --> 03:15.720
No, I mean you're going to
pay for this to be repaired.

03:21.690 --> 03:22.960
Hey, Gibson,

03:22.990 --> 03:25.720
my dad's making me
fix Chyna's A.N.T Pad.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.630
I've got to find some way to get $250.

03:28.660 --> 03:30.630
Ooh. Well, I'd suggest
entering the dog show,

03:30.660 --> 03:31.360
but it won't work.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.900
The first prize isn't $250.

03:33.930 --> 03:35.900
It's $300.

03:38.770 --> 03:40.710
I've got an idea!

03:40.740 --> 03:43.680
I could find a dog, enter the dog show,

03:43.710 --> 03:45.950
win first prize,
fix the A.N.T. Pad,

03:45.980 --> 03:47.880
and throw the other $50 away.

03:49.850 --> 03:50.950
Problem solved!

04:01.960 --> 04:03.760
Hey, Angus.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.730
Check out this night-light
I made for my bedroom.

04:12.970 --> 04:15.870
Hey, Angus,

04:15.910 --> 04:17.839
remember when we were on
that field trip to the zoo

04:17.880 --> 04:19.839
and you said you'd do anything for me

04:19.880 --> 04:22.750
if I never told anyone I caught
you trying to eat a flamingo?

04:23.980 --> 04:26.650
I thought it was cotton candy.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.990
Whatever.
It's payback time.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.760
My A.N.T. Pad
is broken.

04:31.790 --> 04:33.660
Can you retrieve my speech?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.890
Sure. As long as you backed it up.
Ooh.

04:35.930 --> 04:38.730
I didn't back it up!
No one backs up!

04:42.800 --> 04:44.840
Don't worry, Chyna.
I proofread your speech

04:44.870 --> 04:47.810
and I remember every word of it,

04:47.840 --> 04:50.840
including that typo where instead
of "poor," you wrote "poop."

04:52.780 --> 04:55.850
Oh, Olive, thank goodness!

04:55.880 --> 04:57.980
Because Skidmore's had this thing
following me around all day.

04:58.020 --> 05:01.720
Shoo! Go! Go!

05:01.760 --> 05:04.630
I'll help you with that
little bird problem.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.860
Finally, a chance to use my USB rotisserie.

05:12.670 --> 05:14.000
Okay, Olive.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.610
Go into the sound booth, recite
my speech, and I'll record you.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.810
Okay.
All righty.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.640
No, Fletcher, don't plug
that in near my amplifier!

05:22.680 --> 05:23.910
Oh, please.
Nothing's going to happen.

05:23.950 --> 05:24.680
No!

05:37.930 --> 05:40.660
Well, nothing happened to us.

05:43.730 --> 05:45.900
Olive?

05:45.930 --> 05:47.770
Are you okay?
Can you hear anything?

05:49.870 --> 05:51.970
I can hear fine,

05:52.010 --> 05:53.770
but who are you?
And who's Olive?

05:57.750 --> 06:00.710
Oh, no!
This is terrible.

06:00.750 --> 06:02.720
Hello, Terrible.
Nice to meet you.

06:06.820 --> 06:08.690
The sound must have
affected Olive's memory.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.920
She doesn't remember who we are.

06:11.990 --> 06:14.590
You remember me, right?

06:14.630 --> 06:16.630
I'm Angus, your boyfriend.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.580
Perhaps this kiss will remind you.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.520
No!

06:29.940 --> 06:32.570
So, what did the door say?

06:32.610 --> 06:33.870
Oh, he didn't say much,

06:33.910 --> 06:36.610
but I could see in his eyes
he found me irresistible.

06:37.610 --> 06:38.780
Yeah, I meant about Olive.

06:38.810 --> 06:41.820
Oh, he said that the sound waves

06:41.850 --> 06:45.650
caused an inflammation in her hippocampus.

06:45.690 --> 06:47.960
After I yelled at him for making up words,

06:47.990 --> 06:51.760
he explained to me that
there's no physical damage,

06:51.790 --> 06:54.930
but he couldn't predict when,
or if, her memory will return.

06:55.930 --> 06:58.970
Grandma, can I have a candy?

07:01.970 --> 07:04.640
What if her memory doesn't come back?

07:04.670 --> 07:06.610
Well, then she'll no longer have a talent

07:06.640 --> 07:07.610
and she'll have to
leave the A.N.T. Program.

07:07.640 --> 07:11.710
What? No!
You can't do that!

07:11.750 --> 07:13.650
Olive may not have her memory,

07:13.680 --> 07:15.750
but she does have other talents.
Like...

07:17.720 --> 07:18.720
Tap dancing.

07:19.820 --> 07:22.590
I can tap dance?

07:22.630 --> 07:24.700
I guess I must've
forgotten about that, too.

07:33.700 --> 07:34.870
Wow, I am good!

07:36.770 --> 07:39.610
Guess I'll have to find a new memory freak

07:39.640 --> 07:41.880
at the prospective students night.

07:41.910 --> 07:45.580
Oh! Which reminds me, Chyna, are
you finished writing your speech?

07:45.620 --> 07:46.820
Oh, I'm finished.

07:49.650 --> 07:51.690
Bye, leathery lunch lady!

07:53.660 --> 07:58.600
So, Olive, did they do any
X-rays of your brain?

07:58.630 --> 08:00.930
And if so, did they see a
copy of my speech in there?

08:04.770 --> 08:05.540
Olive, hurry up!
They're coming!

08:05.570 --> 08:07.910
Who's Olive?
Who's coming?

08:10.680 --> 08:12.540
Hey! Ow! Hey!

08:12.580 --> 08:14.750
Cut it out! Stop!

08:17.620 --> 08:19.650
Olive?
Are you okay?

08:25.590 --> 08:28.830
Ow! Who wears
golf shoes to school?

08:28.860 --> 08:29.890
Seriously!

08:39.700 --> 08:41.909
I can't keep this
sign-up sign up,

08:41.940 --> 08:44.610
but this is where you sign up, so sign up.

08:45.810 --> 08:47.880
Okay, but this is merely a formality,

08:47.910 --> 08:51.880
since Princess is the
cutest wittle puppy ever.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.720
Come on, Snuggles, let's sign up.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.660
When did you get a dog?

08:59.690 --> 09:02.630
I got him from my dad.
He's a police dog.

09:02.660 --> 09:06.870
Snuggles is a sweetheart as long as
he doesn't hear the word A-T-T-A-C-K.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.770
A-T-T...

09:09.800 --> 09:10.770
Attack?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.840
No!

09:19.580 --> 09:20.840
Release, Snuggles! Release!

09:25.680 --> 09:29.790
Lexi, please don't say you know what again.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.890
This isn't working.
Do either of you have a tack?

09:31.920 --> 09:33.760
No!

09:40.970 --> 09:44.740
All right. Angus, put these
on to protect your ears.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.870
Why?

09:46.910 --> 09:49.610
Well, I figured if a loud sound
made Olive lose her memory,

09:49.640 --> 09:50.940
another loud sound can bring it back.

09:50.980 --> 09:51.680
What?

09:54.710 --> 09:55.750
Here comes Olive!

09:55.780 --> 09:56.710

<i>Hold me.</i>

10:17.800 --> 10:18.600
All right.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.810
Let's see if it worked.

10:20.840 --> 10:24.640
Olive, what is the capital of North Dakota?

10:25.710 --> 10:26.810
Rhinoceros?

10:27.980 --> 10:29.980
Yes, she's back!

10:30.020 --> 10:34.750
Whatever that noise was
made my raven go crazy.

10:34.790 --> 10:36.820
It's out in the hall attacking the janitor.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.930
The raven's all,
"Caw! Caw!"

10:40.960 --> 10:44.700
And the janitor's all,
"My eyes! My eyes!"

10:44.730 --> 10:46.800
Classic.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.670
Good news, Principal Skidmore.

10:53.710 --> 10:54.910
Olive got her memory back!

10:54.940 --> 10:58.740
Oh. Well, let me
check her out myself.

10:59.050 --> 10:59.810
Olive?

10:59.850 --> 11:02.050
No, thanks, I just ate.

11:05.690 --> 11:06.890
You're Olive.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.720
Oh, yeah!

11:09.760 --> 11:11.720
Nice try.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.730
I'm sorry, Olive, but you will
have to leave high school.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.690
Please, Principal Skidmore!

11:16.730 --> 11:18.900
Don't send Olive back to
regular elementary school!

11:18.930 --> 11:19.830
I won't.

11:19.860 --> 11:22.700
She's not ready for elementary school.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.740
Olive, welcome to kindergarten.

11:28.770 --> 11:31.200
Thanks, kindly bag lady!

11:37.170 --> 11:39.870

12:14.040 --> 12:15.840
Oh, Olive!

12:16.540 --> 12:18.880
I have missed you so much!

12:18.910 --> 12:22.010
Yeah. Chyna's missed
you so much!

12:23.530 --> 12:26.080
So, are you okay?

12:26.420 --> 12:27.540
How's it going?

12:28.020 --> 12:33.030
Sorry. Miss Angie said I'm not
supposed to talk to strangers.

12:33.650 --> 12:35.510
You really don't remember me?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.170
I'm your best friend.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.930
No, Isabelle's my best friend.

12:40.030 --> 12:41.900
She gave me a sticker.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.170
What is this supposed to be?

12:48.620 --> 12:50.750
Come on, Fletcher.
Let's go.

12:51.250 --> 12:54.510
The Ant Farm will never
be the same without her,

12:54.550 --> 12:56.420
but I guess this is where Olive belongs.

13:11.330 --> 13:12.230
Oh!

13:13.330 --> 13:15.370
Don't cry, Joshie.

13:15.400 --> 13:19.140
I remember exactly how it went.

13:19.170 --> 13:22.210
Interesting factoid about
the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.480
Prior to restoration completed in 2001,

13:24.510 --> 13:27.450
the tower leaned at
an angle of 5.5 degrees.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.520
But it now leans at
approximately 3.99 degrees.

13:38.230 --> 13:39.490
Seriously, Legan,

13:39.530 --> 13:44.230
my dad won't even let me in the
house till I get the $250.

13:44.260 --> 13:48.300
The dog show starts in 15
minutes and I don't have a dog!

13:48.330 --> 13:52.500
If that's not bad enough, my abdomen is
still sore from all those rabies shots!

13:56.410 --> 13:58.240
Shut up, stupid cat.
Can't you see I'm on the phone?

14:03.420 --> 14:06.480
That's it!
Legan, I've got to go get ready.

14:07.420 --> 14:14.190
Welcome to the dog show!
I love doing that.

14:14.230 --> 14:16.460
I am your host, Gibson,

14:16.500 --> 14:18.430
along with my co-host,

14:18.470 --> 14:23.170
the reigning Golden Collar
recipient, Gibdog.

14:23.470 --> 14:28.380
You're right, Gibdog.
They're not here to see us.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.480
They're here to see
our wonderful contestants.

14:49.530 --> 14:52.470
Excuse me.
I was here earlier.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.270
I think I forgot something.

14:58.210 --> 15:00.540
Actually, I meant my cell phone.

15:00.570 --> 15:03.240
This is exactly the way you had it.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.180
I remember because the pattern
was red, red, yellow,

15:06.210 --> 15:09.280
blue, red, green red, blue,
blue, yellow, green.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.320
And I know this one was on top

15:11.350 --> 15:12.280
because you wiped your nose with it.

15:15.420 --> 15:18.120
Olive, you have your memory back!

15:18.160 --> 15:21.230
Uh... Who's Olive?

15:22.260 --> 15:24.160
Who are you?
Stranger danger!

15:24.200 --> 15:25.230
Stranger danger!

15:26.500 --> 15:28.300
Wait a minute.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.400
You've been faking!

15:32.300 --> 15:34.310
You never lost your memory!

15:34.340 --> 15:38.380
No, I did. Just, when I got
trampled in the hallway,

15:38.410 --> 15:40.380
my memory came back.

15:42.350 --> 15:44.280
I just wanted to get out of high school.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.320
Kindergarten is the life!

15:46.350 --> 15:48.390
I'm the big kid here.
Watch.

15:48.420 --> 15:49.520
Joshie, raisins.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.430
See?
This place is awesome!

15:56.530 --> 15:59.270
So the whole time I was trying
to keep my best friend around,

15:59.300 --> 16:02.470
she was trying just as
hard to get away from me!

16:02.510 --> 16:05.170
No, I never wanted to get away from you,

16:05.210 --> 16:06.370
just the big kids.

16:08.180 --> 16:10.180
Wait, I have an idea!

16:10.210 --> 16:13.250
What if you lose your memory?

16:13.280 --> 16:15.450
We can be in the same kindergarten class!

16:15.480 --> 16:17.150
This might hurt a bit.

16:19.150 --> 16:19.290
Look, I'm out of here.

16:22.260 --> 16:24.190
Oh.

16:24.230 --> 16:26.390
And thanks for making me
rewrite my speech for nothing!

16:32.500 --> 16:35.200
Oh, grow up, Joshie!
You're almost five!

16:38.540 --> 16:41.370
Hmm.
A little overgrown,

16:41.410 --> 16:44.340
but I'm gonna give you some bonus points

16:44.380 --> 16:46.350
for being able to stand on your hind legs.

16:48.180 --> 16:51.490
Now, head up, tail out.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.450
Sassy walk. Like this.

16:57.230 --> 16:59.530
And who do we have here?

16:59.560 --> 17:02.400
This is my dog.
Snoop Dogg, the dog.

17:07.369 --> 17:11.170
Did your dog just meow?

17:11.210 --> 17:13.440
Yes. He does
all kinds of impressions.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.240
You should hear his Jack Nicholson.

17:17.210 --> 17:20.280
What? No, don't
be ridiculous, Gibdog.

17:20.319 --> 17:24.220
That's not a cat.
This is a dog show.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.290
Mmm. Nice ears.

17:28.190 --> 17:30.490
Soft, almost plush.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.310
Come on!

17:34.890 --> 17:37.430
It says dry-clean only!

17:37.470 --> 17:40.340
Ooh-la-la!
High-class dog.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.440
This isn't a dog!

17:43.470 --> 17:45.380
This is a cat!

17:55.490 --> 17:59.320
Well, Snoop Dogg, it looks like
you're the only contestant left.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.390
You win the prize!

18:01.430 --> 18:04.230
Yes! That's my dog!

18:04.530 --> 18:06.290
Good boy!

18:06.330 --> 18:09.230
He is so calm.

18:09.270 --> 18:13.100
So is yours. He's the only other
dog who didn't chase that cat.

18:13.140 --> 18:15.100
That's because Gibdog is blind.

18:15.140 --> 18:17.340
I'm his Seeing Eye man.

18:26.450 --> 18:28.180
Okay, we're clear, Gibdog.

18:34.290 --> 18:37.490
Chyna, I see you have your speech.

18:37.530 --> 18:41.160
Before you start, I'd like to
give you a last-minute pep talk.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.530
Mess this up and you're raven food!

18:46.470 --> 18:50.340
This juice we made
is actually pretty tasty.

18:50.370 --> 18:53.440
Oh, and good news.
I didn't have athlete's foot.

18:53.470 --> 18:55.240
Turns out, it's something
called Albanian toe worms.

19:00.210 --> 19:01.510
Oh, I'm gonna puke!

19:01.550 --> 19:04.480
My speech!

19:04.520 --> 19:08.320
Can I have your attention, everyone?

19:08.360 --> 19:12.090
I want to let one of the shining
stars of the A.N.T. Program

19:12.130 --> 19:13.360
come up and say a few words.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.300
Ladies and gentlemen, Chyna Parks.

19:19.330 --> 19:20.470
I can't go on!
My speech is out of order!

19:20.500 --> 19:23.400
No, you're out of order!

19:25.440 --> 19:29.110
Sorry, I've always wanted to do that.

19:29.140 --> 19:30.480
Chyna, now.

19:38.150 --> 19:39.350
Welcome, parents,

19:39.390 --> 19:43.220
prospective Ants,
faculty and low-flow toilets.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.190
Wait.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.460
And the A.N.T. Program
wouldn't be the same

19:51.500 --> 19:55.270
without the guidance of
Principal Skidmore, who is

19:55.300 --> 19:57.540
asbestos-free, despite
being over 100 years old.

20:00.340 --> 20:02.210
What are you doing?

20:02.240 --> 20:05.140
If I wanted a terrible speech, I
would have had Fletcher do it!

20:05.180 --> 20:08.140
Actually, Chyna wrote a great speech.

20:08.180 --> 20:08.510
And I remember every word of it.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.220
That's right!
I was faking!

20:13.250 --> 20:14.320
Look, Dad!
Look at what the raven's doing!

20:18.190 --> 20:21.260
Olive, if you remember the speech,
then come up here and deliver it.

20:25.300 --> 20:29.430
My old school's track record for dealing
with gifted students was very, very poop.

20:32.500 --> 20:36.310
And in conclusion, I just want to say
that before I started the A.N.T. Program,

20:36.340 --> 20:38.480
I wasn't sure I belonged in high school.

20:38.510 --> 20:42.310
But to my surprise,
the A.N.T. Program has been

20:42.350 --> 20:44.450
one of the best things
that ever happened to me.

20:44.480 --> 20:48.550
Not only has it given me the opportunity
to cultivate my musical talent,

20:48.590 --> 20:52.220
but, most importantly...

20:52.260 --> 20:53.390
It's where I've met my best friend.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.430
I feel the same way about you, Olive!

21:03.340 --> 21:06.370
I'm sorry, guys.
I never should have lied to you.

21:06.410 --> 21:08.240
I'm just glad you're back.

21:08.270 --> 21:10.170
Yeah, Chyna's just glad you're back.

21:15.450 --> 21:17.180
Well, thanks for bailing me out.

21:17.220 --> 21:20.520
And I want you to know I meant
every word that I wrote.

21:20.550 --> 21:23.520
And I meant every word
that you wrote that I said.

21:26.530 --> 21:29.490
So, do you want to hang out after school?

21:29.530 --> 21:32.430
I would, but I've got
a play date with Joshie.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.530
You can come, too, but I got to warn you,

21:34.570 --> 21:36.430
he's a sand thrower.

21:36.470 --> 21:38.370
Joshie.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.540
Yeah, you tell this Joshie
to stay away from my woman!

21:43.270 --> 21:46.210
He's not big, is he?

21:50.450 --> 21:56.250
I hope tonight has been informative to
all of you prospective Ants and parents.

21:56.280 --> 21:58.490
We really do take care of our kids,

21:58.520 --> 22:03.360
and make sure they're in a calm, safe
environment here at the Ant Farm.

22:12.370 --> 22:13.500
Princess!

22:13.540 --> 22:15.470
Heel, Snoop Dogg!

22:15.500 --> 22:16.440
What is going on?

22:16.470 --> 22:20.210
You almost gave me

22:20.240 --> 22:21.540
a heart attack.

22:22.380 --> 22:23.540
No!

22:27.340 --> 22:29.630
Release, Snuggles! Release!
