250 miles an hour! Fire it up!

00:31.335 --> 00:35.319
...Can really stand firm
in a force-five tornado.

00:35.320 --> 00:38.370
I think I'm just gonna take
my vehicle now and go home!

00:38.622 --> 00:41.159
Then the Mythbusters
get a second wind

00:41.160 --> 00:42.947
and turn to invention.

00:43.285 --> 00:44.684
That right there is a result.

00:44.685 --> 00:48.570
Can you really build a
personal tornado protector?

00:48.571 --> 00:49.608
Firing at Adam.

00:49.609 --> 00:51.889
Or will it be all hot air?

00:51.890 --> 00:54.552
That's 180 miles per hour!

01:01.761 --> 01:03.961
who are the mythbuuters?

Adam savage...

01:06.141 --> 01:08.340
How much damage could
I sustain from this?

01:08.341 --> 01:09.674
...And Jamie Hyneman.

01:09.675 --> 01:10.637
Bye-bye!

01:11.201 --> 01:15.588
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:15.926 --> 01:18.367
Joining them... Kari Byron...

01:18.368 --> 01:21.242
Crunching metal! It's awesome.

01:21.243 --> 01:22.479
...Tory belleci...

01:22.480 --> 01:24.187
Is this thing gonna burn?
Oh, yeah, it is.

01:24.188 --> 01:26.491
...And Grant Imahara. I'm free!

01:26.492 --> 01:28.248
They don't just tell the myths.

01:28.249 --> 01:30.804
They put them to the test.

01:31.841 --> 01:37.366
***

01:38.150 --> 01:41.750
get ready, because it's
time to do the twister.

01:43.746 --> 01:45.412
You know, I sense
more than just hot air

01:45.413 --> 01:46.618
coming out of this episode.

01:46.619 --> 01:47.693
And you would be right.

01:47.694 --> 01:48.980
We've got a whole hour coming up

01:48.981 --> 01:51.986
solely about the
power of tornadoes.

01:52.097 --> 01:54.908
And to do this episode, we're
bringing in two amazing experts,

01:54.909 --> 01:59.650
Sean Casey and Reed timmer,
a.K.A.He storm chasers, to help us.

01:59.651 --> 02:00.826
Oh, you mean those guys

02:00.827 --> 02:03.558
that have those cars they've
specially reinforced,

02:03.559 --> 02:05.402
and they drive them right
into the middle of tornadoes.

02:05.403 --> 02:06.811
Exactly.

02:09.222 --> 02:10.612
Take a look now at these clouds

02:10.613 --> 02:12.581
as they are forming
in the distance.

02:12.582 --> 02:14.462
When a tornado is forecast...

02:14.463 --> 02:17.214
Can you swing around
and get that, please?

02:17.215 --> 02:18.640
...The sane response

02:18.641 --> 02:23.376
is to either leave town or
at least duck into a ditch.

02:24.834 --> 02:27.934
Oh, my God! Whoa!

02:28.107 --> 02:30.469
But storm chasers Reed timmer...

02:30.470 --> 02:33.220
Tornado touching down!
There it is! Here it comes!

02:33.221 --> 02:34.795
...And Sean Casey...

02:35.308 --> 02:37.641
Here it comes, right at us!

02:37.642 --> 02:39.910
...Are anything but sane.

02:40.586 --> 02:41.586
Holy

02:41.955 --> 02:44.617
instead, these
Maverick meteorologists

02:44.618 --> 02:48.242
lay their lives on the
line for storm science.

02:48.492 --> 02:50.654
Oh, I wish we had the radar!

02:51.192 --> 02:54.316
All the while, they're
supposedly fully protected

02:54.317 --> 02:56.516
by their souped-up s.U.V.S.

02:57.268 --> 02:58.593
Come on. We got to get out of here.

02:58.944 --> 03:00.355
Or are they?

03:04.448 --> 03:05.523
I'm bleeding.

03:05.961 --> 03:07.273
Yeah, my eyes are bleeding.

03:08.648 --> 03:09.568
What's the plan?

03:09.569 --> 03:11.505
Well, the storm chasers
want us to test

03:11.506 --> 03:14.690
their tornado-proof vehicles
under tornado-like conditions.

03:14.691 --> 03:16.264
Don't they do that all the time?

03:16.265 --> 03:18.449
They drive near tornadoes
all the time, it's true.

03:18.450 --> 03:20.958
But this season specifically,
they're expecting to encounter

03:20.959 --> 03:23.313
higher winds than they've
ever found before,

03:23.314 --> 03:25.378
and they want us to
help them determine

03:25.379 --> 03:28.395
just how tornado-proof
their vehicles really are.

03:28.658 --> 03:30.245
Can we break them?

03:30.457 --> 03:33.407
No one has yet told
me that we can't.

03:37.919 --> 03:40.343
Well, if first impressions
are anything to go by,

03:40.344 --> 03:43.344
this one looks kind of unbreakable.

03:45.499 --> 03:49.024
This is a tornado-intercept
vehicle, or "tiv" for short.

03:49.025 --> 03:51.808
Specifically, this is the tiv2.

03:52.247 --> 03:54.087
It's built on a
modified truck chassis

03:54.088 --> 03:57.711
and it has 10,000 pounds
of composite armor.

03:58.086 --> 04:01.598
Its 2 1/4 inch-thick skin
is composed of layers

04:01.599 --> 04:04.101
of aluminum, kevlar,
aluminum, steel, rubber,

04:04.102 --> 04:07.244
polycarbonate,
rubber, and aluminum.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.218
Its windows are made

04:09.219 --> 04:12.532
of about an inch of
glass and polycarbonate.

04:12.568 --> 04:14.587
In addition to its regular armor,

04:14.588 --> 04:16.730
it's also got four hydraulic panels

04:16.731 --> 04:18.773
which can be lowered all
the way to the ground

04:18.774 --> 04:20.281
to prevent high-speed winds

04:20.283 --> 04:22.882
from getting underneath the
vehicle and creating lift.

04:24.214 --> 04:26.849
It has a couple of
40-inch-long spikes

04:26.850 --> 04:28.478
that anchor it to the ground.

04:28.897 --> 04:31.115
And it all adds up to
the state of the art

04:31.116 --> 04:34.145
in tornado preparedness
and research.

04:34.832 --> 04:36.302
And to top all that,

04:36.303 --> 04:41.040
today it comes complete with
two experts par excellence...

04:41.165 --> 04:43.828
the tiv2's owner, Sean Casey,

04:44.078 --> 04:47.003
and the dominator's Reed timmer.

04:47.004 --> 04:50.097
But believe it or not, the
storm chasers are worried

04:50.098 --> 04:54.387
that both their cars' tank-like
traits aren't enough.

04:55.175 --> 04:57.263
Nice ride. What can we do for you?

04:57.264 --> 04:59.372
Well, tornado season's
coming up really soon,

04:59.373 --> 05:01.279
and it's an el nino
year, so we expect

05:01.280 --> 05:03.126
some of the strongest
tornadoes on record.

05:03.127 --> 05:04.037
Well, where do we come in?

05:04.038 --> 05:06.150
Well, this vehicle
has withstood winds

05:06.151 --> 05:08.090
up to 145 miles per hour

05:08.091 --> 05:10.591
but we'd like to know
what the outer limits are.

05:10.592 --> 05:11.933
So can you guys make us a tornado

05:11.934 --> 05:13.314
to test both of our vehicles?

05:13.334 --> 05:15.334
Sure. Absolutely.

05:15.427 --> 05:18.459
Well, the Mythbusters sure
know how to brew up a storm.

05:18.460 --> 05:21.789
After all, they've built
a perilous pea shooter...

05:23.808 --> 05:25.407
That's pretty serious.

05:26.402 --> 05:30.077
...They've survived a round of "
man versus fan"...

05:30.198 --> 05:33.247
I'm still good, but my suit's
starting to come apart.

05:33.262 --> 05:36.624
...And they joked around
with Hollywood jets.

05:38.803 --> 05:40.165
That's a hot car.

05:40.763 --> 05:41.776
Holy

05:42.526 --> 05:45.212
but to best simulate
a full-on twister

05:45.213 --> 05:48.013
when it's not storm-chasing season,

05:49.186 --> 05:51.236
there's only one place to go.

05:51.987 --> 05:54.820
I can't believe they let us back
after tearing up their runway.

05:55.469 --> 05:56.737
We're the Mythbusters.

05:56.738 --> 05:57.979
You can't expect us to show up

05:57.980 --> 05:59.818
without something
getting destroyed.

06:00.685 --> 06:05.727
Kalitta air's 747, in
deepest snowy Michigan,

06:05.728 --> 06:07.617
is the perfect tool to test

06:07.618 --> 06:11.747
if the storm chaser chariots
are really tornado-proof.

06:12.134 --> 06:13.293
And here's how.

06:13.294 --> 06:15.302
When it comes to making tornadoes,

06:15.303 --> 06:17.217
there's really not a
whole lot out there

06:17.218 --> 06:19.218
that has enough
power to do the job.

06:19.431 --> 06:22.479
This is our tornado.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.735
Oh, it may look like a 747 to you.

06:24.736 --> 06:28.092
But to us, it's the perfect
experimental platform.

06:28.205 --> 06:30.808
All we got to do is
push on this lever...

06:30.905 --> 06:32.651
And this engine spins up,

06:32.652 --> 06:37.278
putting out 45,150
pounds of thrust.

06:37.279 --> 06:38.818
And out comes a tornado.

06:40.311 --> 06:42.455
Simple, really, and what's more,

06:42.456 --> 06:45.859
it comes with the storm
chasers' seal of approval.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.198
There are three parts to the
winds inside a tornado...

06:48.199 --> 06:49.549
the rotational...

06:50.563 --> 06:52.412
Those intense updrafts...

06:53.462 --> 06:55.900
And just the pure, raw wind speed.

06:56.301 --> 06:57.699
And for our vehicles,

06:57.700 --> 06:59.993
it's that raw wind speed that
we're most interested in,

06:59.994 --> 07:04.023
and that's why a 747 engine is
the perfect tornado simulator.

07:04.577 --> 07:07.232
The 747, with its massive thrust,

07:07.233 --> 07:09.659
is the perfect storm
for this experiment.

07:09.660 --> 07:12.309
It'll unleash its
tornado-like power

07:12.310 --> 07:15.228
directly onto the storm
chasers' chariots,

07:15.229 --> 07:18.551
to see if they can
hold firm or flip out.

07:20.225 --> 07:23.335
But the Mythbusters aren't
going to unleash the beast

07:23.336 --> 07:25.600
on the chasers' vehicles just yet.

07:25.601 --> 07:29.343
I'm standing 175 feet from
the engine of this airplane,

07:29.344 --> 07:31.091
which right here will give us

07:31.092 --> 07:35.671
160 miles per hour of
tornado-force winds.

07:36.711 --> 07:39.405
Instead, they're starting
with a regular car,

07:39.406 --> 07:42.385
to see how that can
weather the weather.

07:42.965 --> 07:44.602
So, Reed, right about here,

07:44.603 --> 07:46.886
it's gonna be going
160 miles an hour

07:46.887 --> 07:48.389
when they fire that jet up.

07:48.390 --> 07:50.576
Can you put that in
context what that means?

07:50.577 --> 07:53.865
Yeah, that's about a mid-range
ef-3 tornado for us,

07:53.866 --> 07:55.693
and that's the
enhanced fujita scale,

07:55.694 --> 07:57.213
and that's a strong tornado,

07:57.214 --> 07:59.010
and it would cause serious
damage to a house,

07:59.011 --> 08:00.529
likely lifting the roof off.

08:01.062 --> 08:02.724
Let's see what it does to the car.

08:04.449 --> 08:06.704
And with the team
relocated to the runway,

08:06.886 --> 08:08.536
it's all systems go.

08:09.137 --> 08:12.924
This is what we call a "co
ntrol," or a lack thereof.

08:13.361 --> 08:15.401
All right, let's fire
up those engines.

08:15.402 --> 08:17.139
Okay. Turning number three.

08:18.351 --> 08:21.858
The pilot flips the switch marked "
unleash hell."

08:21.859 --> 08:25.659
And a couple of seconds later,
that's exactly what happens.

08:30.223 --> 08:31.173
Whoa!

08:38.712 --> 08:41.852
The car is, quite
literally, a pushover.

08:43.260 --> 08:45.810
And that's got Sean a little torn.

08:46.060 --> 08:47.435
Oh!

08:47.584 --> 08:49.134
It'll be okay, Sean.

08:51.285 --> 08:54.523
I think I'm just gonna take
my vehicle now and go home!

08:54.710 --> 08:55.479
All right?

08:56.696 --> 08:58.883
Actually, Sean, sorry, buddy,

08:58.884 --> 09:01.396
but it's too late to back out now.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.846
Our fake tornado blew
the car about 50 feet,

09:04.847 --> 09:06.271
and it blew the hood off the car,

09:06.272 --> 09:09.121
which is now about a quarter
mile away from where it started.

09:09.533 --> 09:12.350
Now, if you'd been in that
car, you would have survived,

09:12.351 --> 09:15.395
but the brown-pants factor -
sky high.

09:15.849 --> 09:18.040
All right, so, 160 miles an hour

09:18.041 --> 09:21.249
blew that car's hood right
off and moved it 50 feet.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.735
You guys ready to put the tiv2

09:22.736 --> 09:23.885
and the dominator to the test?

09:23.886 --> 09:25.314
Definitely. Yeah, let's do it.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.998
All right. Let's do it.

09:29.223 --> 09:30.551
Undeterred by test one,

09:30.552 --> 09:32.085
it's full steam ahead.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.585
All right, Sean. Bring in the tiv2.

09:34.910 --> 09:37.327
Watching the tiv2
come towards here,

09:37.328 --> 09:39.384
I feel like I'm
living out my fantasy

09:39.385 --> 09:42.002
of being in a post-apocalyptic
thriller film.

09:42.153 --> 09:45.731
But the tiv2 is just part
of the storm chaser arsenal.

09:45.732 --> 09:46.577
Beautiful!

09:46.702 --> 09:50.089
Reed's weapon of choice
is the dominator.

09:51.801 --> 09:54.029
So, this is the dominator.
Tell me about it.

09:54.030 --> 09:56.829
It has bomb-proof coating
atop 16-gauge steel,

09:56.830 --> 09:59.544
polycarbonate windows,
and hydraulics

09:59.545 --> 10:01.138
that allow the vehicle
to drop to the ground

10:01.139 --> 10:02.425
so no wind can get underneath.

10:02.426 --> 10:04.214
So, what's the top wind
speed it's been in?

10:04.215 --> 10:06.852
We measured 155.2 miles per hour

10:06.853 --> 10:08.321
at a tornado in Wyoming last year.

10:08.322 --> 10:11.249
Well, we're gonna do it at 160.
What do you think?

10:11.250 --> 10:12.816
I think it could
definitely handle it.

10:13.863 --> 10:17.696
Both Reed and Sean are confident
there'll be no carnage.

10:17.697 --> 10:19.517
And when their awesome autos

10:19.518 --> 10:22.122
initiate their
storm-proof features...

10:23.334 --> 10:24.934
You can see why.

10:25.680 --> 10:29.803
One plane, two engines,
and two tornado-proof cars

10:29.804 --> 10:34.829
being exposed to 160 miles per
hour of tornado-force winds.

10:35.317 --> 10:36.791
Let's see how they're gonna do.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.019
Okay, well, let's do it.

10:40.020 --> 10:42.520
All right. Fire up those engines.

10:43.149 --> 10:46.720
Come on, baby. Oh, stick in there.

10:46.721 --> 10:50.171
Oh, dear. Here we go.
Okay, baby, hold in there.

10:50.389 --> 10:54.501
Be brave! Stiff upper lip!

10:59.340 --> 11:02.596
Remember, they've chosen
160 miles per hour

11:02.597 --> 11:05.569
because it's faster than
the fastest wind speed

11:05.570 --> 11:07.990
either car has ever endured.

11:10.552 --> 11:13.284
At first, it seems like
it's plain sailing,

11:13.285 --> 11:14.389
but then...

11:15.512 --> 11:18.346
Oh! My door! My door!

11:18.347 --> 11:20.996
...The tiv's door gets ripped open.

11:21.066 --> 11:25.314
But luckily for Sean,
nothing else moves a micron.

11:25.315 --> 11:26.628
That would have been a wild ride!

11:26.629 --> 11:28.503
Thank you! That was awesome!

11:30.453 --> 11:31.427
We made it.

11:32.094 --> 11:33.534
So it's job done.

11:33.535 --> 11:37.704
Other than a flawed door,
the vehicles held firm.

11:39.397 --> 11:42.625
I think the test went very
well, except for one thing...

11:42.626 --> 11:45.124
I forgot to lock the
driver's-side door.

11:45.125 --> 11:48.084
So, something to definitely
remember in the future.

11:49.096 --> 11:51.374
The dominator handled the
160-mile-per-hour wind

11:51.375 --> 11:53.362
like a champ, and
that's the strongest one

11:53.363 --> 11:55.281
we've ever experienced
with this vehicle,

11:55.282 --> 11:57.236
and it was totally fine,
didn't even budge.

11:57.237 --> 11:59.881
But remember -
you're watching Mythbusters.

11:59.882 --> 12:03.347
And the fat lady's not even close.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.508
Well, they survived 160.

12:05.509 --> 12:07.335
Yeah they did, but...

12:08.073 --> 12:09.924
...That's not all we're
gonna give 'em, are we?

12:09.925 --> 12:10.812
No.

12:11.699 --> 12:12.924
Let's ramp it up.

12:13.833 --> 12:14.882
Coming right up,

12:14.883 --> 12:19.128
the storm chasers feel the
force of a force-five tornado.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.098
All right! We're good!

12:27.997 --> 12:29.930
With tornado season approaching,

12:29.931 --> 12:33.081
the storm chasers have asked
the Mythbusters to find out

12:33.082 --> 12:37.931
if their souped-up s.U.V.
S are really tornado-proof.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.435
Fire up those engines!

12:41.922 --> 12:45.193
And because they survived
a snowy test one,

12:45.194 --> 12:47.605
it's time to ramp things up.

12:49.214 --> 12:51.037
These vehicles were purpose-built

12:51.038 --> 12:52.698
to be able to withstand tornadoes.

12:52.699 --> 12:56.315
But so far, they've only seen
about half what one can put out.

12:56.316 --> 12:59.435
This time we're gonna
dial it all the way up

12:59.436 --> 13:01.788
to 250-mile-an-hour winds,

13:01.789 --> 13:05.255
which is the equivalent
of an ef-5 tornado,

13:05.256 --> 13:06.523
the highest rating there is.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.842
That kind of wind will
strip a house clean off

13:08.843 --> 13:10.462
right down to its foundation,

13:10.601 --> 13:12.764
and we're gonna see what
it does to this car.

13:13.897 --> 13:16.262
It's such a fearsome wind speed

13:16.263 --> 13:20.418
that the guys are doing a trial
run with a regular car first.

13:20.419 --> 13:21.482
What's gonna happen?

13:21.483 --> 13:23.677
Well, this car's gonna
spin end-over-end.

13:23.678 --> 13:24.435
What's gonna happen

13:24.436 --> 13:26.501
is the last thing that's ever
gonna happen to this car.

13:26.502 --> 13:28.414
It's gonna blow
away down the field.

13:30.401 --> 13:31.489
All right. Let's do it.

13:31.964 --> 13:35.413
Okay. Regular car,
250 miles an hour.

13:36.026 --> 13:37.163
Fire it up!

13:38.798 --> 13:42.498
That's it! Whoa!

13:43.181 --> 13:45.131
From zero to hero,

13:45.206 --> 13:47.694
the jet soon reaches
full throttle...

13:48.543 --> 13:51.543
...Whereupon the car
tumbles like a toy.

13:58.099 --> 13:58.924
Stop!

14:03.298 --> 14:04.286
That was great.

14:05.538 --> 14:07.625
It's a case of "now you see it...

14:09.254 --> 14:10.381
Now you don't,"

14:11.367 --> 14:14.167
since just 2 seconds after takeoff,

14:14.168 --> 14:17.017
the car is 250 feet away.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.675
Oh, it picked that car right up

14:19.676 --> 14:20.779
and took it quite a ways.

14:20.780 --> 14:23.078
It did. You think your cars
will fare a little better?

14:23.079 --> 14:25.291
Definitely. You ready to
put them in the position?

14:25.292 --> 14:27.279
Certainly. Then let's do it.

14:27.704 --> 14:29.603
But as their cars are secured

14:29.604 --> 14:31.374
in the full-on firing line,

14:31.375 --> 14:34.958
the storm chasers' mojo goes awol.

14:34.959 --> 14:38.025
250 miles per hour
is insanely fast.

14:38.026 --> 14:41.070
I'm hoping the dominator will be
okay, because this is my baby.

14:41.071 --> 14:42.713
Yeah, the final test

14:42.714 --> 14:46.514
where this vehicle encounters
250-mile-per-hour winds...

14:46.515 --> 14:48.937
this has never happened
to this vehicle before.

14:48.938 --> 14:51.443
And of course something you've
spent your life working on,

14:51.444 --> 14:54.313
that being damaged, in front of
you and in front of everybody,

14:54.314 --> 14:55.900
it's horrifying.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.805
It's the moment of truth.
You ready?

14:58.005 --> 14:59.046
As I'll ever be.

14:59.047 --> 15:01.496
All right! Let's fire it up!

15:05.958 --> 15:07.923
Sean, did you lock
the door this time?

15:08.085 --> 15:08.898
Check.

15:09.171 --> 15:12.757
Once again, the source
of the force is fired up,

15:12.758 --> 15:14.048
and a moment later,

15:14.049 --> 15:18.594
a 250-mile-per-hour
wind storms through.

15:18.699 --> 15:21.274
At first, the vehicles hold firm.

15:23.024 --> 15:26.397
The tiv, with its anchor
points, barely moves.

15:26.398 --> 15:27.697
But then, suddenly,

15:27.698 --> 15:30.186
the dominator starts
to lose its footing.

15:30.704 --> 15:32.205
All right! We're good!

15:32.610 --> 15:35.197
It slides in the force five.

15:35.297 --> 15:36.666
Oh, my God!

15:37.303 --> 15:39.524
But thanks to its lower chassis,

15:39.525 --> 15:43.938
the wind can't get underneath it
to lift it up or topple it over.

15:43.939 --> 15:46.139
It, too, survives.

15:47.952 --> 15:49.193
Nicely done!

15:49.194 --> 15:52.121
Thank you for not destroying
my vehicle! It's okay!

15:53.808 --> 15:54.509
Beautiful!

15:54.510 --> 15:55.879
Hey, good job.

15:56.562 --> 15:57.168
Well that's great.

15:57.169 --> 16:00.520
Even though it went sideways,
it stayed firmly on the ground.

16:00.521 --> 16:01.916
It never got under it.

16:01.917 --> 16:02.848
Yeah, I think there was always

16:02.849 --> 16:05.313
some downward force
there, which was good.

16:05.342 --> 16:06.866
That was a great test.

16:07.190 --> 16:08.400
Sure was.

16:08.477 --> 16:12.199
The high-speed shows the strain
both vehicles were under.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.135
And although one did move,

16:14.136 --> 16:19.161
this 250-mile-per-hour test
was clearly survivable.

16:19.399 --> 16:21.161
And that's what counts.

16:21.373 --> 16:23.585
The tiv pretty much
sat there like a rock.

16:23.586 --> 16:25.768
It didn't slide, it didn't vibrate,

16:25.769 --> 16:27.136
it didn't budge an inch.

16:27.259 --> 16:29.267
The dominator, on the other hand,

16:29.268 --> 16:31.529
started to move around
from the very get-go,

16:31.530 --> 16:33.917
and eventually, it came
broadside to the wind

16:33.918 --> 16:35.680
and really started
to pick up speed.

16:35.755 --> 16:39.278
But it never lost its balance,
it never lost its stance.

16:39.279 --> 16:40.492
The bottom line is,

16:40.493 --> 16:42.916
with both of these vehicles
and that kind of wind,

16:42.917 --> 16:44.218
you would have been safe.

16:44.230 --> 16:45.968
Thank God it's okay!

16:47.318 --> 16:49.047
Despite its wild slide,

16:49.048 --> 16:51.256
Reed's once-over reveals

16:51.257 --> 16:55.355
the dominator only suffered
a bent license plate.

16:56.205 --> 17:00.842
But it's the tiv that really
testifies to the test's power.

17:01.494 --> 17:03.002
Oh, my gosh. Look at that.

17:03.003 --> 17:03.965
Yeah, they're bowing.

17:04.203 --> 17:05.964
The hydraulic piston,

17:05.965 --> 17:07.651
that anchor that
goes in the ground...

17:07.939 --> 17:08.839
it's bent.

17:09.102 --> 17:10.467
The force of that wind

17:10.468 --> 17:14.263
actually bent something that
was rated to 9,500 pounds.

17:15.244 --> 17:16.046
Wow.

17:17.907 --> 17:20.057
In the fury of the force five,

17:20.058 --> 17:23.156
the tiv's anchor points
bent under pressure.

17:23.156 --> 17:26.542
But even so, the occupants
would have survived.

17:26.544 --> 17:27.768
And that means

17:27.769 --> 17:30.288
it's "mission accomplished"
for the Mythbusters.

17:30.289 --> 17:34.814
The storm chaser chariots
are indeed tornado-proof.

17:37.001 --> 17:39.887
Later, Jamie puts
his life on the line

17:39.888 --> 17:41.372
for tornado protection.

17:41.373 --> 17:42.553
***

17:43.211 --> 17:44.623
this is what a man looks like!

17:52.560 --> 17:54.421
The storm chaser vehicles

17:54.422 --> 17:57.860
survived a 747's most
powerful tornado.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.955
Thank you for not destroying
my vehicle! It's okay!

18:01.784 --> 18:02.872
And that means

18:02.873 --> 18:06.996
that both cars can get the
Mythbusters seal of approval.

18:07.110 --> 18:11.160
But Adam and Jamie are the
gift that keeps on giving.

18:11.872 --> 18:14.487
Well, gentlemen, I officially
pronounce your vehicles

18:14.488 --> 18:18.413
both Mythbusters-tested
to 250 miles per hour.

18:18.414 --> 18:19.329
Nice.

18:19.443 --> 18:21.824
Well, we know that these
cars are safe in a tornado,

18:21.825 --> 18:24.024
but what if you're not in the car?

18:24.180 --> 18:26.316
Well, you're out of luck.
Big problems.

18:26.317 --> 18:28.435
You know, I think we may
be able to come up with

18:28.436 --> 18:30.089
a solution for you on that front.

18:30.090 --> 18:31.597
That'd be quite a challenge.

18:31.598 --> 18:34.485
Give us a few days, and we'll
see what we can come up with.

18:34.486 --> 18:36.038
When a tornado hits,

18:36.039 --> 18:39.548
being in a Mythbusters-approved
armored vehicle is one thing.

18:39.549 --> 18:43.860
But if you're outside with
nowhere to run or hide,

18:43.861 --> 18:46.222
then surely you're toast.

18:46.322 --> 18:49.040
Well, not if the Mythbusters
can somehow build

18:49.041 --> 18:52.384
a personal
tornado-protection device.

18:52.509 --> 18:54.190
If Adam and Jamie want
to build us something,

18:54.191 --> 18:55.283
this is what it's got to do...

18:55.284 --> 18:58.610
it has to be portable, it has
to protect us from flying debris

18:58.611 --> 19:01.163
and have winds of at
least ef-3 intensity,

19:01.164 --> 19:03.322
which is stronger than
135 miles per hour.

19:04.035 --> 19:07.666
Well, back at m5, it's
the calm before the storm

19:07.667 --> 19:11.395
as the guys nut out the
problem, starting with Adam.

19:11.396 --> 19:12.496
All right, let me
walk you through this.

19:12.497 --> 19:15.020
As far as I'm thinking it through,

19:15.021 --> 19:17.486
I think this personal-protection
device has to do three things...

19:17.487 --> 19:19.133
it has to keep you
from blowing away

19:19.134 --> 19:20.873
'cause that would hurt and suck,

19:20.874 --> 19:23.044
it has to protect you
from flying debris

19:23.045 --> 19:24.793
'cause that would hurt and suck,

19:24.794 --> 19:28.639
and it has to adapt very quickly
to changing wind directions,

19:28.640 --> 19:31.533
one of the most, I
think, nefarious things

19:31.534 --> 19:32.857
that happens in a tornado.

19:33.245 --> 19:34.348
And this is my solution.

19:34.349 --> 19:36.588
It's basically some
kind of armored bowl.

19:36.589 --> 19:38.896
I'm thinking that shape is ideal

19:38.897 --> 19:40.533
for allowing the wind
to slip over it...

19:40.534 --> 19:42.519
a low coefficient of
drag on the ground.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.862
But that's not enough.

19:43.863 --> 19:46.582
I'm also thinking a
wing shape on top,

19:46.583 --> 19:49.344
pushing the person and his
personal-protection device

19:49.345 --> 19:51.475
into the ground, keeping
him where he is.

19:51.476 --> 19:54.646
That's the theory, at least.
It's time to prototype.

19:55.573 --> 19:58.222
Adam's got two builds
to contend with.

19:58.223 --> 20:02.457
First, his prototype,
and then a wind tunnel,

20:02.458 --> 20:05.246
which, courtesy of
four leaf blowers...

20:06.190 --> 20:09.828
...Should provide a decent
draft to run the tests in.

20:10.803 --> 20:13.398
And, thanks to the
wonders of editing,

20:13.399 --> 20:16.738
both are ready just about now.

20:16.739 --> 20:18.458
So I put together
a whole collection

20:18.459 --> 20:20.087
of funnels, cones, and bowls,

20:20.088 --> 20:22.215
both with and without
downforce winds,

20:22.216 --> 20:23.693
and I'm gonna place
each one of these

20:23.694 --> 20:26.399
in my simulated tornado's path

20:26.400 --> 20:29.411
and see which one locks
itself best to the ground.

20:31.478 --> 20:33.995
That's the plan, but
it's not a good start,

20:33.996 --> 20:37.800
as none of the metal bowls
is what you'd call stable.

20:41.414 --> 20:45.096
The addition of a downforce
wing may be good in theory,

20:45.159 --> 20:47.358
but it's not so good in practice.

20:51.356 --> 20:52.930
A final pit stop

20:52.931 --> 20:56.856
sees Adam minimize the surface
area exposed to the wind.

20:56.868 --> 20:59.368
And that gives cause
for some hope...

21:01.102 --> 21:03.815
...Until that one,
too, bites the dust.

21:08.414 --> 21:10.901
Well, little dude, I've
tried every combination

21:10.902 --> 21:13.327
of bowl and cone and
wing that I can imagine,

21:13.328 --> 21:15.735
and as far as I can
see, every one I'm using

21:15.761 --> 21:17.091
makes such a high profile

21:17.092 --> 21:19.890
they all just blow away in the
wind even worse than nothing.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.217
I think we got to Chuck this one.

21:22.218 --> 21:24.955
If you agree with me,
don't do anything.

21:26.604 --> 21:28.129
I think he agrees with me.

21:28.660 --> 21:29.758
So, our question is,

21:29.759 --> 21:32.459
how are you gonna keep yourself
from getting blown away

21:32.460 --> 21:33.772
in a strong wind?

21:34.043 --> 21:36.081
Obviously, if you're
standing upright,

21:36.082 --> 21:37.897
it's easy to knock you over.

21:37.898 --> 21:39.532
You could start lying prone,

21:39.620 --> 21:43.538
and this way you would present
less surface area to the wind,

21:43.539 --> 21:44.331
and that's a good thing.

21:44.332 --> 21:47.441
But what if the ground
is smooth and hard?

21:47.442 --> 21:49.037
You don't really have any way

21:49.038 --> 21:52.481
of digging into the ground
or putting a statake on it,

21:52.844 --> 21:54.311
and that starts me thinking

21:54.312 --> 21:58.731
that maybe we can use the wind
itself to give you traction.

21:59.870 --> 22:02.857
Playing his cards
close to his chest...

22:03.370 --> 22:06.030
Jamie runs a series
of traction tests

22:06.031 --> 22:08.850
that don't mean much
to anyone but him.

22:10.483 --> 22:12.244
That, right there, was a result.

22:12.245 --> 22:14.607
But judging by the giggling...

22:15.694 --> 22:17.582
...It seems to be going well.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.487
Kind of like a wing shape.

22:21.216 --> 22:24.309
After a whole afternoon
of dialing in the testing,

22:24.310 --> 22:27.160
Jamie's finally
ready to reveal all.

22:29.510 --> 22:32.434
After a lot of fussing around,
this is what I've come up with.

22:32.435 --> 22:35.048
This thing is made
of several segments.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.348
It has a wind vane on the back,

22:37.423 --> 22:42.297
and it has a pivot point and
spike that grabs on the ground.

22:42.347 --> 22:44.230
Now, how this works is this...

22:44.279 --> 22:47.518
as the wind comes over it,
this wedge-shaped design

22:47.519 --> 22:51.778
allows the wind to press
this spike into the ground

22:51.779 --> 22:53.231
and gives us traction.

22:53.232 --> 22:56.485
It also allows that spike
to serve as a pivot point

22:56.486 --> 22:59.933
that he can shift with,
thanks to this wind vane.

22:59.934 --> 23:02.382
Also, because of this
wedge-shaped device,

23:02.383 --> 23:04.381
we have good debris deflection.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.176
And, last but not least,

23:06.177 --> 23:08.380
this whole thing is
extremely portable

23:08.414 --> 23:11.789
because it folds up like so...

23:13.825 --> 23:17.807
And can attach to his back,

23:17.919 --> 23:19.145
and he can walk around with it.

23:19.146 --> 23:20.832
The man's a miracle.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.011
Each of the three criteria

23:23.012 --> 23:26.495
addressed successfully
in half an afternoon,

23:26.533 --> 23:28.270
at least in small scale.

23:29.112 --> 23:31.387
Well, dude, I think we've
got a winner there.

23:31.749 --> 23:33.145
Time to go full-scale, huh?

23:33.146 --> 23:34.346
Absolutely.

23:35.740 --> 23:38.321
But, as the storm
chasers will testify,

23:38.322 --> 23:40.825
full-scale will be full-on.

23:40.826 --> 23:41.726
Stay down.

23:41.851 --> 23:44.364
It's gonna be intense,
you guys. Hang on.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

23:54.796 --> 23:57.348
Twisters can be
seriously dangerous.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.454
No, not those twisters.

23:59.926 --> 24:01.376
Those twisters.

24:04.363 --> 24:08.074
But to reduce that danger, at
the storm chasers' request,

24:08.075 --> 24:11.915
Jamie's prototyped a
personal tornado protector,

24:12.050 --> 24:14.350
and it's time to go full-scale,

24:15.162 --> 24:17.436
where their shopping
list includes...

24:17.437 --> 24:19.712
polyethylene, check...

24:20.075 --> 24:22.288
Duct tape, check...

24:22.500 --> 24:25.238
1/8-inch aluminum, check...

24:25.375 --> 24:27.950
Some ballistic nylon, check...

24:28.150 --> 24:30.897
And a Hyneman, check.

24:31.801 --> 24:32.823
The plan is this.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.083
I'm gonna be making what
amounts to a low-slung...

24:36.084 --> 24:37.534
That's my baby.

24:37.648 --> 24:41.196
...Streamlined, and very
heavily armored tent.

24:42.271 --> 24:43.427
Oh, yeah.

24:46.616 --> 24:48.926
Just like a tent that you
would go backpacking with,

24:48.927 --> 24:51.372
this will fold up
into a neat package,

24:51.373 --> 24:54.222
and then, when you're ready
to use it, you unfold it.

24:54.946 --> 24:56.908
Now it's starting to look serious.

24:57.353 --> 25:01.451
It's got armored panels, it's
got aluminum tent poles...

25:01.452 --> 25:04.702
Okay, everyone, be quiet.
It's Jamie's nap time now.

25:04.902 --> 25:06.945
...It's got heavy-duty fabric.

25:06.946 --> 25:09.814
You crawl inside, and you're safe.

25:10.753 --> 25:13.101
And with the addition
of a spiked base

25:13.102 --> 25:15.064
that will secure it
into the ground...

25:16.009 --> 25:19.820
That is what says I'm
not going anywhere

25:19.821 --> 25:21.983
in a few-hundred-
miles-an-hour wind.

25:22.034 --> 25:22.752
That works.

25:23.553 --> 25:24.926
...It's ready for some testing.

25:24.927 --> 25:25.590
It's all done.

25:25.728 --> 25:29.278
Let's pack it up and see how
debris-proof it actually is.

25:29.478 --> 25:30.177
Okay.

25:33.047 --> 25:36.325
And that's portability passed.

25:37.276 --> 25:38.327
Nice.

25:38.404 --> 25:39.342
Here we go.

25:39.384 --> 25:40.320
I love it.

25:41.646 --> 25:44.754
Our tornado-protection device
needs to do three things here.

25:44.755 --> 25:46.692
It needs to keep you
from blowing away,

25:46.693 --> 25:48.248
it needs to protect
you from debris,

25:48.249 --> 25:50.168
and it needs to be
able to face the wind

25:50.169 --> 25:51.305
and change its direction.

25:51.306 --> 25:53.879
Today, we're testing
protection from debris.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.073
Our debris will be

25:55.074 --> 25:57.544
this soda-can-sized piece
of wood right here,

25:57.545 --> 25:59.108
which will be fired at our device

25:59.109 --> 26:01.592
by this, Jamie's little pop gun.

26:01.779 --> 26:02.667
That's right.

26:02.818 --> 26:06.117
Jamie's pop gun last
popped out soda cans

26:06.118 --> 26:08.542
at 250 miles an hour...

26:11.280 --> 26:13.173
...With frightening results.

26:13.174 --> 26:13.980
You killed him.

26:13.981 --> 26:17.381
You tripped all the shock-watch
stickers in his chest.

26:17.805 --> 26:20.320
But this time, it's got wood.

26:21.005 --> 26:23.992
Why are we firing these wood
cylinders at our shield?

26:23.993 --> 26:26.924
Well, first off, we're
fresh out of cows,

26:26.925 --> 26:29.969
and, secondly, wood debris
is the most likely thing

26:29.970 --> 26:31.529
that you're gonna
find in a tornado,

26:31.530 --> 26:34.390
and so that's what
this is representing.

26:34.754 --> 26:37.353
And representing the
person in the prototype

26:37.354 --> 26:38.654
is Buster...

26:40.946 --> 26:44.346
...Who, for once, may
not need to be nervous.

26:44.601 --> 26:45.627
It's beautiful.

26:45.689 --> 26:47.039
He's ready to try 'em out?

26:47.040 --> 26:48.082
I think so.

26:48.531 --> 26:52.799
Well, as we prepare to fire
some not-insignificant debris

26:52.800 --> 26:53.705
at our tornado shield,

26:53.706 --> 26:55.365
I have to say I've got high hopes

26:55.366 --> 26:58.532
for its ability to withstand
what we're gonna throw at it.

26:59.048 --> 27:01.423
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

27:03.209 --> 27:04.498
Dr. Hyneman, are you ready?

27:04.499 --> 27:05.060
I'm ready.

27:05.061 --> 27:09.383
Okay, debris test
in three, two, one.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.445
Oh, yeah!

27:14.620 --> 27:16.220
Did it hit it? Oh, yeah.

27:17.121 --> 27:18.334
It hit it and glanced off,

27:18.335 --> 27:21.307
and it's about 600 feet that way.

27:22.746 --> 27:24.032
Geezum crow!

27:25.332 --> 27:26.293
The wood plug,

27:26.294 --> 27:29.843
travelling at an f-4
tornado's 200 miles per hour

27:29.844 --> 27:31.482
was a direct hit.

27:32.332 --> 27:34.607
And the shield hardly shifted.

27:37.373 --> 27:38.768
That handled it really well.

27:38.769 --> 27:40.343
I didn't even see it move.

27:40.344 --> 27:43.994
So, for test two, it's
out with Buster...

27:45.440 --> 27:49.152
...And in with an altogether
more valuable Guinea pig.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.431
Based on our test,
Adam should be okay.

27:51.432 --> 27:53.815
But just in case,
he's wearing a helmet

27:53.816 --> 27:56.442
and we also have EMT sanjay.

27:56.891 --> 27:58.603
Do I think this will work?

27:58.848 --> 28:00.707
I'd better be pretty
confident it'll work.

28:00.708 --> 28:02.214
I'm about to get inside of it.

28:02.215 --> 28:04.833
Am I a little scared? Yes, I am.

28:04.872 --> 28:06.832
Do I always answer
my own questions?

28:06.833 --> 28:07.882
No, I do not.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.932
With Adam in the tent,
it's time to vent.

28:13.570 --> 28:17.020
Okay, debris test firing at Adam

28:17.220 --> 28:21.144
in three, two, one.

28:24.032 --> 28:27.629
Once again, it's a direct hit
that's deflected with ease.

28:27.643 --> 28:29.554
I feel great. That was nothing.

28:29.676 --> 28:31.226
It was like a little tap.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.626
Cool. Awesome!

28:34.288 --> 28:37.825
Well, as we hoped, as we
expected, and as we saw,

28:37.826 --> 28:38.540
the tornado shield

28:38.541 --> 28:42.799
effectively protects its
user from flying debris,

28:42.800 --> 28:45.668
even debris flying at
tornado-like speeds.

28:46.981 --> 28:50.894
Now all we need is a big tornado
to test out the rest of it.

28:51.080 --> 28:54.653
It's pretty simple, really, but
sometimes the best ideas are.

28:55.697 --> 28:56.669
And the fact is, it worked.

28:57.420 --> 28:59.932
Now all we need to
do is find a tornado.

29:00.057 --> 29:01.382
That shouldn't be that hard.

29:02.323 --> 29:05.397
If more is what you want,
more is what we've got.

29:05.398 --> 29:08.810
Log on to discovery.
Com/mythbusters.

29:20.221 --> 29:22.370
Tornado touching down!
There it is! Here it comes!

29:22.371 --> 29:25.019
As Reed timmer and
Sean Casey will tell,

29:25.020 --> 29:29.020
with winds reaching speeds in
excess of 200 miles an hour,

29:29.023 --> 29:31.818
tornadoes are no laughing matter...

29:31.819 --> 29:36.592
Hold on! Seatbelts!
We're in the middle e of it!

29:36.606 --> 29:39.705
...Which is why the
Mythbusters are here to help.

29:41.074 --> 29:42.199
Let's recap.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.236
The storm chasers have
these amazing vehicles

29:44.237 --> 29:45.839
to protect them from tornadoes,

29:45.840 --> 29:48.484
but nothing if they get
caught outside the vehicles.

29:48.485 --> 29:49.584
Jamie and I have designed

29:49.585 --> 29:52.577
what we think is a
viable tornado shield

29:52.578 --> 29:55.002
to protect a human outside
of one of these vehicles,

29:55.003 --> 29:56.897
and we've come back to kalitta air

29:56.898 --> 30:00.123
to fire up their 747
and test it out.

30:00.562 --> 30:03.344
So, you ready to see
the tornado shield?

30:03.345 --> 30:04.175
For sure.

30:04.176 --> 30:06.054
You transport it
with a backpack, too.

30:06.055 --> 30:06.894
That's incredible.

30:08.055 --> 30:10.256
So, you're going on a
hike with your backpack.

30:10.257 --> 30:11.727
You see a tornado coming.

30:12.350 --> 30:14.739
You can't get out of the
way, so you deploy this.

30:14.740 --> 30:19.066
That's exactly right.
And that's pretty much it.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.715
Well, it sure looks cool.

30:21.095 --> 30:25.014
So far, storm chasers Reed
and Sean are impressed.

30:25.015 --> 30:28.419
And they should be, because
the rig's two for zero,

30:28.420 --> 30:31.282
but now comes the ultimate test.

30:32.621 --> 30:34.396
Well, not quite now.

30:34.809 --> 30:36.604
Before we test our tornado shield,

30:36.605 --> 30:38.135
we need something to compare it to.

30:38.136 --> 30:39.297
That's called a control,

30:39.298 --> 30:42.141
and that control is called...
Adam savage.

30:42.142 --> 30:45.275
I'm going to stand here,
directly in the wind stream,

30:45.276 --> 30:48.306
until I can't "stands"
no more, and that will be

30:48.307 --> 30:50.850
the point at which we
test the tornado shield.

30:50.887 --> 30:53.221
In other words, to
be a viable system,

30:53.222 --> 30:55.174
Jamie in the shield

30:55.175 --> 30:58.773
has to withstand more wind
than a person without a shield.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.299
I am ready!

31:00.511 --> 31:02.273
And to find that level,

31:02.274 --> 31:04.674
Adam's staring down the barrel.

31:05.105 --> 31:07.329
Ah, how am I feeling?

31:07.954 --> 31:10.054
I have to admit, I'm
a little nervous.

31:10.207 --> 31:12.741
I know the safety
system we have in place,

31:12.828 --> 31:15.578
but it's not every day
you stand behind...

31:15.579 --> 31:17.628
A freaking jet!

31:17.999 --> 31:20.967
However, I can step
out of the wind stream

31:20.968 --> 31:24.404
of the jet's engine at any
time, and they can cut it

31:24.405 --> 31:26.341
in a moment's notice -
or a second's notice...

31:26.342 --> 31:28.661
so I guess there's nothing
to do but proceed.

31:29.619 --> 31:32.467
Adam is clipped into
a safety harness,

31:32.468 --> 31:36.130
and he has established some
hand signals with Jamie.

31:36.192 --> 31:39.117
So, I put one hand up p ad that means "
increase the power."

31:39.118 --> 31:39.868
Exactly.

31:40.043 --> 31:42.300
Waving around means "
get me the hell out of here."

31:42.301 --> 31:44.014
Exactly. Awesome.

31:44.221 --> 31:48.171
But even so, this is
downright dangerous.

31:48.295 --> 31:50.832
It's time for Adam to
go into the tornado.

31:51.069 --> 31:52.207
He's a brave man.

31:53.069 --> 31:55.207
Okay. Fire that puppy up.

31:57.481 --> 31:58.381
For safety,

31:58.382 --> 32:01.148
the pilot starts the
thrust at just 20%,

32:01.149 --> 32:04.951
which allows Adam to heave
himself to his start point.

32:10.008 --> 32:13.020
Once there, the pilot
ramps up the thrust.

32:13.112 --> 32:17.287
30% is 100 miles per hour
for our fearless mythbuster.

32:17.537 --> 32:19.624
40%... 110.

32:19.774 --> 32:24.236
50%... 120, and he's still holding.

32:25.275 --> 32:27.686
But when the wind hits 130...

32:30.536 --> 32:32.196
...He gets a knockdown blow.

32:40.084 --> 32:44.484
Like a feather in front of a
fan, Adam stood no chance.

32:51.592 --> 32:53.607
How you doing? I'm good.

32:55.224 --> 32:56.762
That was awesome!

32:56.937 --> 32:58.775
There were a lot of things
to worry about in that one,

32:58.776 --> 33:01.624
chief among them, debris
flying towards me.

33:01.625 --> 33:04.035
But I found, being able to see
where the wind was coming from,

33:04.036 --> 33:07.129
that I could actually dodge things
that were heading towards me.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.989
That was crazy, crazy, crazy fun.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.801
I want to do it again. I really do.

33:12.802 --> 33:15.201
But I don't think we
need me to do it again.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.702
Afraid not, Adam, because
we've got the data.

33:18.703 --> 33:23.055
130 miles an hour, and
you're flying without wings.

33:23.573 --> 33:24.839
Without any protection,

33:24.840 --> 33:28.289
Adam lost control at
about 130 miles an hour.

33:28.390 --> 33:30.977
Now it's time to test
the tornado shield.

33:31.164 --> 33:33.976
I'm feeling pretty good about it.
I'm going for 180.

33:34.823 --> 33:36.607
I'm standing on the
spot where I withstood

33:36.608 --> 33:40.740
winds of 130 miles per hour
before I got blown away.

33:40.741 --> 33:42.757
The question is, will
the tornado shield

33:42.758 --> 33:45.381
allow Jamie to stay here
at a higher wind speed?

33:45.382 --> 33:46.940
We have the ability

33:46.941 --> 33:50.367
to make the wind speed here
up to 180 miles per hour.

33:50.368 --> 33:52.004
It's the perfect place to test.

33:52.285 --> 33:56.409
And Jamie, as usual, seems
somewhat nonchalant,

33:56.410 --> 33:58.672
despite the very real danger.

33:58.842 --> 34:01.003
The thing about going
behind airplanes,

34:01.004 --> 34:04.866
like this, in prototypes -
it's dangerous.

34:04.929 --> 34:06.675
We don't know what
this is gonna do.

34:06.763 --> 34:08.949
I believe I'm gonna be all right.

34:09.074 --> 34:10.079
Just the very fact

34:10.080 --> 34:13.420
that I'm down on the ground low
and I've got some protection,

34:13.732 --> 34:15.245
I think it'll be good.

34:15.371 --> 34:16.571
And remarkably,

34:16.572 --> 34:19.896
that's confidence that the
storm chasers agree with.

34:19.897 --> 34:21.431
I'm really impressed by this.

34:21.433 --> 34:23.393
It's low to the ground,
it's aerodynamic,

34:23.393 --> 34:24.710
no wind will go underneath.

34:24.712 --> 34:26.956
I give it a 100%-percent
chance of survival.

34:30.616 --> 34:32.976
I have two predictions as to
how this test is gonna go.

34:32.976 --> 34:35.312
I think, absolutely,
that the tornado shield

34:35.313 --> 34:38.277
will allow Jamie to stay here
at wind speeds higher than 130.

34:38.591 --> 34:40.684
I'm guessing maybe 150, actually,

34:40.685 --> 34:42.079
which is a pretty
significant difference.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.382
I'm also predicting

34:43.384 --> 34:45.815
that jamieakes the thing
home to take naps in.

34:45.878 --> 34:47.402
Look at how comfortable
he is in it.

34:47.791 --> 34:48.541
I'm in.

34:49.804 --> 34:52.804
Well, there's no time like
the present to find out.

34:53.141 --> 34:56.717
All right. Here's the first test
of the human tornado shield.

34:57.216 --> 34:58.917
Go ahead and start the engines.

34:59.784 --> 35:01.188
***

35:01.189 --> 35:02.989
******

35:03.046 --> 35:07.170
like last time, the pilot ups
the thrust in increments.

35:07.524 --> 35:08.836
***

35:08.837 --> 35:10.349
yeah, now he feels it.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.495
One design flaw of the shield

35:13.496 --> 35:16.032
is that Jamie cannot see out of it.

35:16.895 --> 35:20.483
You can only imagine how
terrifying it must be

35:20.569 --> 35:22.354
as the pilot ups the ante.

35:22.355 --> 35:24.413
***

35:24.414 --> 35:26.171
******

35:26.946 --> 35:28.071
***

35:30.283 --> 35:34.521
the shield holds up well as
the wind creeps beyond 130.

35:34.522 --> 35:38.009
But suddenly, things take
a turn for the worse.

35:41.430 --> 35:45.962
The suit tears away, and Jamie
is left vulnerably exposed.

35:48.375 --> 35:49.315
***

35:50.208 --> 35:53.022
the pilot cuts the engine
almost immediately,

35:53.023 --> 35:58.048
but like some sort of cyborg,
Jamie survived intact.

35:58.560 --> 35:59.524
How you doing?!

36:00.523 --> 36:04.548
I was fine!
The tornado shield wasn't!

36:05.906 --> 36:07.243
It just, like...

36:10.905 --> 36:14.855
As the wind hit 135,
the suit went awol,

36:15.136 --> 36:19.184
but the pilot cut the engines
before any real harm was done.

36:20.701 --> 36:23.800
The weird thing is that
you're in there in the dark.

36:24.690 --> 36:27.290
That, right there, is
enough to freak you out.

36:32.703 --> 36:35.652
Once the wind started
going, I was fine.

36:35.702 --> 36:39.776
The problem comes when
things start to flap a lot.

36:39.777 --> 36:43.263
And at that point, it started
to kind of move around

36:43.264 --> 36:45.277
to where it actually
moved away from me.

36:47.577 --> 36:49.989
But once Jamie collects the shield

36:49.990 --> 36:51.576
from the other end
of the airport...

36:51.577 --> 36:54.514
It's still all there.
Looks like a pin fell out.

36:54.813 --> 36:57.063
...It seems all is not lost.

36:57.701 --> 36:59.540
Moments ago, behind
me, what happened

36:59.541 --> 37:04.039
was the tornado shield's top
separated from its bottom,

37:04.040 --> 37:05.399
effectively delaminated,

37:05.400 --> 37:08.638
exposing the creamy center
that is James Hyneman.

37:08.912 --> 37:10.627
Jamie's gonna make
some modifications.

37:10.628 --> 37:13.174
He's gonna get right
back on that horse

37:13.175 --> 37:14.575
and get in front of that jet!

37:14.576 --> 37:15.937
That's the spirit!

37:22.033 --> 37:25.400
I'm standing in the main
deck of the 747 cargo plane,

37:25.401 --> 37:26.611
not for anything to
do with the story

37:26.612 --> 37:29.870
but just because...
It's so fricking cool!

37:30.020 --> 37:32.272
This is one of my favorite
parts about this job,

37:32.273 --> 37:33.650
is getting to look
around the corners

37:33.651 --> 37:36.082
and see some of this stuff while
we're working on other things.

37:36.108 --> 37:39.207
All right. Now back to your
regularly scheduled program.

37:40.708 --> 37:41.750
It's getting stronger!

37:41.751 --> 37:43.665
Being outside during a tornado

37:43.666 --> 37:46.162
is a potentially lethal idea,

37:46.325 --> 37:48.787
something Jamie's just confirmed.

37:51.433 --> 37:53.976
His tornado shield
was looking promising

37:53.977 --> 37:58.395
until, at just over 130
miles per hour, it blew it.

38:00.657 --> 38:01.532
Cut it. Cut it.

38:02.894 --> 38:05.977
But Jamie's not giving
up without a fight.

38:07.600 --> 38:09.101
This was the problem.

38:09.548 --> 38:12.263
These things right
here I made pivot

38:12.264 --> 38:14.684
so that the whole thing
could fold up neatly.

38:14.685 --> 38:17.447
They're what actually holds
the whole thing to the ground.

38:17.448 --> 38:20.452
Because they pivoted,
they were allowed to move

38:20.453 --> 38:23.398
and they let go of
the actual shield.

38:23.909 --> 38:26.321
So we're gonna actually
bolt them in place

38:26.322 --> 38:27.634
and bolt them to the shield.

38:27.635 --> 38:31.635
They won't let go this time,
and I think I'll stay in place.

38:31.910 --> 38:35.666
All right. There it is. Good luck.

38:39.578 --> 38:42.816
There he goes, one of
God's own prototypes.

38:43.358 --> 38:45.371
Once more, Jamie suits up

38:45.372 --> 38:49.233
directly behind the
warming-up engines of the 747.

38:50.899 --> 38:52.075
Are you all right?

38:52.823 --> 38:54.061
Okay, I'm good.

38:54.548 --> 38:55.437
Okay!

38:57.587 --> 38:58.812
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

38:58.813 --> 38:59.858
Back by popular demand,

38:59.859 --> 39:02.598
it's Jamie Hyneman in
"tornado shield 2...

39:02.599 --> 39:03.642
the back to the
drawing board" tour.

39:03.643 --> 39:05.465
Jamie, take it away.

39:05.754 --> 39:07.478
***

39:07.579 --> 39:09.378
all right. Start those engines.

39:09.379 --> 39:11.292
Jamie sounds really
impatient in there.

39:11.293 --> 39:13.577
He's like, "I'm still standing by,"

39:13.578 --> 39:15.290
as if we've, like,
forgotten about him.

39:15.765 --> 39:18.902
Okay! Here it is!

39:20.688 --> 39:23.163
***

39:23.338 --> 39:26.137
******

39:26.377 --> 39:30.376
at 110 miles an hour,
Jamie's finding it a breeze.

39:30.377 --> 39:31.715
***

39:32.654 --> 39:33.995
******

39:33.996 --> 39:37.366
so, the wind speed's
increased to 130.

39:37.367 --> 39:39.730
***

39:41.606 --> 39:43.094
******

39:44.506 --> 39:47.605
he's now experiencing 130!

39:48.460 --> 39:49.886
***

39:50.622 --> 39:51.696
******

39:51.697 --> 39:53.177
***

39:54.527 --> 39:56.704
with the suit holding up, the pilot

39:56.705 --> 40:01.138
puts the pedal to the metal,
increasing the speed to 180.

40:02.403 --> 40:04.503
***

40:05.388 --> 40:09.395
Jamie and the suit are
clinging on for dear life,

40:09.396 --> 40:11.468
but that seems to be working.

40:11.469 --> 40:12.856
***

40:12.857 --> 40:13.868
******

40:16.570 --> 40:18.507
***

40:18.701 --> 40:20.469
******

40:27.751 --> 40:29.364
***

40:30.326 --> 40:33.087
that's 180 miles per hour!

40:34.662 --> 40:36.062
I'm cutting it!

40:36.104 --> 40:37.540
All right, cut it.

40:38.585 --> 40:41.022
Incredibly, Jamie and his suit

40:41.023 --> 40:44.159
successfully survived
an f-4 tornado.

40:44.334 --> 40:47.508
It's absolutely "
mission accomplished."

40:48.058 --> 40:49.083
You did it!

40:51.535 --> 40:52.947
***

40:53.472 --> 40:56.241
he withstood 180 miles per hour!

40:56.579 --> 40:58.297
What was he saying?
Was it pretty loud in there?

40:58.298 --> 40:59.478
I could barely hear him.

40:59.479 --> 41:03.398
He's like, "oh, this is intense!
Oh, I'm feeling it now!"

41:03.399 --> 41:04.904
Let's go talk to him.

41:15.206 --> 41:17.920
That was 180 miles an hour!

41:17.921 --> 41:20.631
Yeah, baby! 180!

41:25.876 --> 41:27.439
It was like...

41:28.500 --> 41:30.374
That was just flat-out terrifying.

41:30.375 --> 41:32.592
There's absolutely
nothing you can do

41:32.593 --> 41:33.876
with that kind of power

41:34.226 --> 41:37.495
except hold on and hope
that the rig holds.

41:37.496 --> 41:38.983
And by golly, it hold.

41:38.984 --> 41:40.482
It held! It held:

41:40.483 --> 41:43.744
I was waiting for the claw -
"what's gonna let go?"

41:43.745 --> 41:45.406
But nothing did.

41:45.407 --> 41:48.832
I was getting beaten by
the surface of this thing.

41:48.833 --> 41:49.694
Wow!

41:49.819 --> 41:51.669
It's like being spanked.

41:52.769 --> 41:55.531
Okay. Nice work.

41:59.491 --> 42:03.125
The high-speed shows just
how intense that was.

42:03.126 --> 42:07.150
With ice chunks hitting and
a 180-mile-an-hour wind,

42:07.151 --> 42:09.088
the prototype rocked.

42:09.847 --> 42:10.418
I got to say,

42:10.419 --> 42:12.919
when we first started talking
about the tornado shield,

42:12.920 --> 42:15.297
we went through a
lot of design ideas,

42:15.298 --> 42:17.185
but I didn't think that any of them

42:17.186 --> 42:19.793
would have withstood
what I saw here.

42:19.856 --> 42:23.152
Nothing prepared me for how
devastating that wind was.

42:23.153 --> 42:26.154
And our tornado shield,
with only one modification,

42:26.155 --> 42:29.068
held its ground in
180-mile-per-hour winds

42:29.069 --> 42:30.262
with nothing holding it down

42:30.263 --> 42:33.131
except some spikes
keeping it from sliding.

42:35.707 --> 42:37.368
That is amazing.

42:37.643 --> 42:38.681
Jamie did great.

42:38.682 --> 42:42.480
The first test he did,
oh, he failed miserably.

42:44.430 --> 42:46.138
But he did alterations.

42:46.139 --> 42:48.631
And in the end, he came
through with flying colors.

42:48.632 --> 42:50.770
I don't know that everybody
in the tornado belt

42:50.771 --> 42:52.855
is gonna want to carry one
of these things around,

42:52.856 --> 42:55.493
but we saw what happened
to an unprotected person.

42:56.957 --> 42:59.986
We saw what happened to a
car, and the simple fact

42:59.987 --> 43:03.818
is that if you had one of these
and you got in it in a tornado,

43:03.819 --> 43:05.183
you'd be safe.

43:05.532 --> 43:09.519
Well, you guys wanted a tornado,
and we brought a tornado.

43:09.520 --> 43:12.030
And you've got a new piece
of hardware for your kit.

43:12.031 --> 43:13.409
Man, I can't believe you did that.

43:13.410 --> 43:16.082
It's gonna be a great
tornado season.
