in this house

02:08.169 --> 02:09.796
we use a little
word called "please."

02:09.879 --> 02:11.589
It's the coolest
video game ever.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.091
I'm sorry, honey

02:13.174 --> 02:16.302
but those games cost
up to and including $70.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.721
And they're violent and they
distract you from your schoolwork.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.348
Those are all good points,
but the problem is

02:20.431 --> 02:22.600
they don't result
in me getting the game.

02:22.684 --> 02:23.810
I know how you feel, Bart.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.186

02:25.270 --> 02:26.604
I wanted an electric
football game

02:26.688 --> 02:27.981
more than anything
in the world.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.108

04:31.396 --> 04:34.357
Maybe if I stand next
to the games looking sad

04:34.440 --> 04:37.068
someone will feel sorry for me
and buy me one.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.707

04:50.790 --> 04:52.083

10:50.941 --> 10:53.944
Cool! A book of carpet samples.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.988
Come on, new bike.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.868
Oh, a soiled wig.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.037
(garbled) <i>Merry Christmas</i>
<i>and a Happy New Year.</i>

11:04.705 --> 11:05.998
(gulping)

11:06.082 --> 11:07.625
MARGE: Bart, what's
taking so long?

11:07.708 --> 11:09.585
If you're having that problem
with your zipper

11:09.669 --> 11:11.003
I can send your father up.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.463
Oh, no, I'm not.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.758
What's the matter
with your face?

11:15.841 --> 11:18.177
Is that a fake nose?

11:18.260 --> 11:19.887
Are you wearing
chin putty?

11:19.970 --> 11:23.140
I don't have to listen
to these wild allegations.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.604
Please, Bart,
no more pranks.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.022
It would mean
so much to me

11:30.106 --> 11:31.857
if we could have

11:31.941 --> 11:33.776
just one nice
family photo.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.281
Hey!

11:39.365 --> 11:41.200
I don't remember
saying that!

11:42.785 --> 11:45.121
Uh-oh, almost forgot
to lock the doors.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.249
(moaning)

11:50.000 --> 11:51.252
I hope you're going

11:51.335 --> 11:52.920
to the Valley Vista
Try-N-Save, kid

11:53.003 --> 11:55.673
'cause you don't want
to come to my store.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.550
Cat-feesh?

12:04.682 --> 12:06.142
So we're just going to do this photo
and get out, right?

12:06.225 --> 12:07.309
Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.769
I want to look
at the pets

12:08.853 --> 12:10.146
and write things
on the typewriters

12:10.229 --> 12:11.272
and see if the new
dictionaries are in!

12:11.355 --> 12:12.314
Okay.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.899
I want to price some
flip-flops

12:13.983 --> 12:15.484
and smell the new tires

12:15.568 --> 12:17.278
and consult the pharmacist
for some free medical advice.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.613
Sure, we're going
to have a great day.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.031
Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.324
Right, Bart?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.576
Bart?

12:23.659 --> 12:24.577
What's wrong, honey?

12:24.660 --> 12:26.370
Uh-oh!

12:26.454 --> 12:29.206
Somebody's
got tired little legs.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.624
(grunts)

12:35.504 --> 12:38.174
Mmm, wonder where
the flip-flops are...

12:38.257 --> 12:39.258
Menswear?

12:39.341 --> 12:40.801
Maybe it's sporting goods?

12:40.885 --> 12:42.261
Wait, no, sleepwear.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.597
Oh, probably, better living.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.182
(loud sigh)

12:46.265 --> 12:48.184
-(alarms blaring)
-(scared shudder)

12:48.267 --> 12:50.394
Oh, Homie,
look at that watch.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.813
I've always wanted
a watch like that.

12:52.897 --> 12:57.485
Well, maybe someone
will give you one for Christmas.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.111
<i>Now she'll really be surprised</i>

12:59.195 --> 13:01.113
<i>when she opens</i>
<i>that ironing board cover.</i>

13:05.493 --> 13:08.662
HOMER: Pfft, must have been
a pretty slow century.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.334
(gasps)

13:13.417 --> 13:14.585
The store detective!

13:14.668 --> 13:16.378
Hey, Ansel Adams,
let's go!

13:16.462 --> 13:17.755
Take the photo!

13:17.838 --> 13:19.548
Wait, wait! I don't want
Maggie's face

13:19.632 --> 13:22.051
hidden behind
that pacifier!

13:22.134 --> 13:23.010
(whimpering)

13:24.136 --> 13:25.471
Don't worry, mama.

13:25.554 --> 13:26.806
I can put a smile
on baby's face.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.015
Okay, sugarplum

13:28.098 --> 13:31.602
it's time to meet
Mr. Funny-voice.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.103
(high-pitched voice)
Hello, aluh...

13:33.187 --> 13:34.688
(normal voice)
Oh, it's just air.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.317
Well, come on.
Hurry up.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.277
Okay, people.
One, two, three.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.073
I thought I told you:

13:44.156 --> 13:46.325
No returns for
busted merchandise.

13:46.408 --> 13:47.993
What are you doing to my son?

13:48.077 --> 13:51.080
I'm afraid your son
broke the 11th commandment.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.915
Thou shalt not steal.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.416
That's crazy.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.417
Bart's not
a shoplifter.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.961
He's just a little boy.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.421
Oh, sure, now he's
just a little boy

13:59.505 --> 14:01.090
stealing little toys.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.425
But someday he'll
be a grown man

14:03.509 --> 14:06.470
stealing stadiums
and... quarries.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.097
My son may not
be perfect

14:08.180 --> 14:10.724
but I know in my heart
he's not a shoplifter.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.311
Fine! Play the tape.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.814
Then everyone can see
you've got the wrong boy.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.525
Wait!

14:19.608 --> 14:21.235
Mom, I don't want
you to see this.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.113
I did it.

14:28.325 --> 14:31.537
LISA: Bart, I wouldn't have
expected this even from you!

14:31.620 --> 14:33.330
My son's a thief.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.207
Oh, Bart.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.882
Stealing?! How could you?!

14:42.965 --> 14:44.967
Haven't you learned
anything from that guy

14:45.050 --> 14:48.429
who gives those sermons at church--
captain what's-his-name?

14:48.512 --> 14:50.973
We live in a
society of laws!

14:51.056 --> 14:52.349
Why do you
think I took you

14:52.433 --> 14:54.101
to all those Police
Academy movies?

14:54.184 --> 14:55.561
For fun?!

14:55.644 --> 14:57.521
Well, I didn't hear
anybody laughing!

14:57.605 --> 14:58.981
Did you?!

14:59.064 --> 15:01.442
Except at that guy
who made sound effects.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.651
(blubbering Doppler effect)

15:02.735 --> 15:03.652
(muffled zooming)

15:03.736 --> 15:04.987
(blows raspberry)

15:05.070 --> 15:06.280
Honk, honk!

15:06.363 --> 15:08.365
(imitates explosion)

15:08.449 --> 15:09.867
(laughs)

15:09.950 --> 15:11.160
Where was I?

15:11.243 --> 15:13.329
Oh, yeah.
Stay out of my booze.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.124
Mom, I'm really sorry.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.500
I know you are.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.336
Is there anything
I can do?

15:20.419 --> 15:22.338
I don't know.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.548
Why don't you
go to bed?

15:24.632 --> 15:25.925
Okay.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.226
(sighs despondently)

15:36.310 --> 15:38.354
Man, I thought Mom was going
to scream me stupid.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.022
She didn't even
raise her voice.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.524
I admit I haven't known
Mom as long as you have

15:42.608 --> 15:44.360
but I know when
she's really upset.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.569
Her heart won't
just wipe clean

15:45.653 --> 15:47.488
like this bathroom
counter top.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.198
It absorbs everything
that touches it

15:49.281 --> 15:52.368
like this bathroom rug.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.370
Really? You think
this might be

15:54.453 --> 15:56.872
one of those
forever-type things?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.540
(muffled):
I don't know.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.293
(squishing)

16:01.377 --> 16:04.046
MARGE:
<i>♪ Lisa's on the sleepy train ♪</i>

16:04.129 --> 16:06.382
<i>♪ To rest her weary head ♪</i>

16:06.465 --> 16:08.884
<i>♪ Her ticket is a candy cane ♪</i>

16:08.968 --> 16:11.470
<i>♪ Made out of gingerbread ♪</i>

16:11.553 --> 16:12.471
(Lisa giggles)

16:12.554 --> 16:13.555
LISA:
Good night, Mom.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.391
Good night,
sweetheart.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.101
(footsteps approaching)

16:17.184 --> 16:18.477
Oh, great.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.397
The tuck-in express
is right on time.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.358
Good night.

16:29.571 --> 16:30.990
I figured out
the boy's punishment.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.574
First, he's grounded.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.035
No leaving the house,
not even for school.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.620
Second, no eggnog.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.956
In fact, no nog period.

16:39.039 --> 16:42.167
And third, absolutely
no stealing for three months.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.836
I always thought
I understood

16:43.919 --> 16:45.087
my special little guy

16:45.170 --> 16:46.463
but somewhere
along the road

16:46.547 --> 16:48.257
his hand slipped away

16:48.340 --> 16:49.425
from mine.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.427
Ah, what are you gonna do?

16:53.262 --> 16:54.763
(groans softly)

16:54.847 --> 16:57.516
He's not my little
baby anymore.

16:57.599 --> 17:00.269
Maybe I mother him too much.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.154
(yawns)

17:12.740 --> 17:15.492
Hey, Mom, you
didn't wake me up.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.828
Here's your
hot chocolate.

17:17.911 --> 17:20.122
You didn't put
my marshmallow in.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.624
I think you're old enough
to do it yourself now.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.419
Okay. I can handle that.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.136
Hey!

17:34.219 --> 17:35.763
Give me a slice.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.641
Milhouse, do you ever worry

17:39.725 --> 17:42.144
that your Mom
might stop loving you?

17:42.227 --> 17:44.271
What? I'm more worried
about piranhas.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.231
Did you see that movie

17:46.315 --> 17:48.525
where they sent a nuclear submarine
to fight the piranhas

17:48.609 --> 17:50.444
and one of them swims
right down the periscope

17:50.527 --> 17:52.488
and bites the guy in the eye,
and he goes:

17:52.571 --> 17:54.031
(screams)

17:54.114 --> 17:56.158
and that old lady
told him it would happen?!

17:56.241 --> 17:58.994
Yeah. That was pretty good.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.329
How come you're not
playing Bonestorm?

18:00.412 --> 18:02.122
Ah, it got boring.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.957
I'm really into
this cup and ball now.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.835
Whoa! Wow! Whoa-ho-ho!

18:06.919 --> 18:08.170
Man, you never know

18:08.253 --> 18:11.298
which way this crazy
ball's going to go.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.591
Yeah, right. You're just
trying to trick me

18:12.674 --> 18:13.592
because you don't
want me playing

18:13.675 --> 18:14.968
with your video game.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.429
Here. Go ahead.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.056
No. Let me try
the cup and ball.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.349
Get your own!

18:20.432 --> 18:22.017
Come on, don't be
a cup-and-ball hog.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.519
Hey, give it!
That's my --

18:23.602 --> 18:24.728
Milhouse, come on!
Give me the cup and ball.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.105
Cup and ball hog!
Oink, oink!

18:26.188 --> 18:28.982
Mom! Bart's smoking!

18:29.066 --> 18:30.192
All right. Out, out.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.401
Go, go, go, go.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.820
Miss Milhouse, what are
you...

18:32.903 --> 18:33.904
Okay, okay, okay.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.364
I won't bug Milhouse

18:35.447 --> 18:38.075
but, well...
Mrs. Van Houten

18:38.158 --> 18:40.577
this is going to
sound kind of dumb

18:40.661 --> 18:44.790
but can I hang out with you
while you do Mom stuff?

18:51.213 --> 18:53.298
Who are Dan
and Sherry Adler?

18:53.382 --> 18:54.466
Just friends of ours.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.802
Oh. And who is Warren Burke?

18:56.885 --> 18:58.846
Oh, he used to tune our piano

18:58.929 --> 19:00.806
before we got rid of it.

19:00.889 --> 19:02.683
He grew up
in Mechanicsburg.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.352
-Oh, really?
-Mm.

19:05.435 --> 19:07.104
Tell me I'm good.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.440
(Marge laughing)

19:10.524 --> 19:12.317
Oh, hey, that's Mom!

19:12.401 --> 19:14.069
She's happy again.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.949
You guys made a snowman family?

19:19.032 --> 19:20.492
Check it out, boy.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.829
It's like looking
into a living snow mirror.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.581
Why didn't you
wait for me?

19:25.664 --> 19:27.249
I didn't think
you'd mind.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.335
I figured you were getting
a little too old for this.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.336
But you can still make one.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.337
There's some snow left

19:32.421 --> 19:34.006
under the car.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.314
(moans)

19:50.397 --> 19:51.982
Stupid family.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.525
Hey, Simpson.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.986
Look what I swiped
from Try-N-Save.

19:56.069 --> 19:59.072
It's a replacement tire
for a wheelbarrow.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.157
Huh.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.575
I knew you'd like it.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.202
(laughs)

20:05.662 --> 20:08.081
Everybody thinks
I'm the black sheep.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.168
Well, I'll show them
what a black sheep can do.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.633
Mom...

20:17.716 --> 20:20.219
this fake snow
is making me dizzy.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.720
We're almost finished.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.473
There's just a
little bit of green left.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.183
(humming)

20:26.266 --> 20:27.601
There you are.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.978
You can help me
spray the cookies.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.563
Are you hiding something?

20:31.647 --> 20:33.523
What do you have
under your jacket?

20:33.607 --> 20:34.524
Nothing.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.776
Oh, Bart. Not again!

20:35.859 --> 20:36.985
Give it to me.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.528
I told you,
I don't have anything.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.530
You can't hide from me
in this house, Bart.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.992
I spend 23 hours
a day here.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.204
(laughing)

20:47.287 --> 20:48.580
Get him, Ma.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.166
There's no place
left to run, Bart.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.292
Hand it over.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.379
Oh, Bart.

20:55.462 --> 20:58.090
I can't believe you did this.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.635
I wanted to surprise you
for Christmas.

21:01.718 --> 21:06.265
Oh, sweetie, this is the best
present a mother could get!

21:06.348 --> 21:08.725
(loud smooching)

21:08.809 --> 21:11.478
I love you so much!

21:11.561 --> 21:13.313
My little bitty Barty!

21:14.564 --> 21:16.275
Mom!

21:20.654 --> 21:22.447
Since I got
my present early

21:22.531 --> 21:24.700
I think you should get
yours early too.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.285
Bart got a present early?!

21:26.368 --> 21:28.537
Then I should get a present early!
I want a present!

21:28.620 --> 21:29.746
Lisa, you have to wait.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.164
(groans)

21:31.248 --> 21:33.959
Okay. This is
the worst Christmas ever.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.836
Now I know you
love video games

21:35.919 --> 21:39.214
and I asked the clerk
which is the one every boy wants.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.173
You got me...

21:43.719 --> 21:44.761
(stifled groan)

21:44.845 --> 21:47.347
Oh... yeah!

21:48.890 --> 21:50.559
Thanks, Mom!
