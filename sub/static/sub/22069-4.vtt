WEBVTT

00:08.742 --> 00:10.978
When did you see Byrne last?

00:11.045 --> 00:13.047
Give me a time line, agent.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.450
In other words, you lost her?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.419
We'll discuss this
back at the office.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.678
Did anybody see you?

00:44.745 --> 00:46.914
It's him.
It's him, Nick.
I found proof.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.782
Slow down. Proof of what?

00:48.849 --> 00:50.418
At Radford's. He keeps
a journal. He drew what
I've been seeing.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.752
You broke in at Radford's?

00:51.819 --> 00:53.587
I had to. Just listen to me.
He keeps a journal.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.989
He has one from just
after I was captured.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.491
There is no way that
he could have known.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.959
I told you to stay at the hotel.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.394
It has the bleeding eye
drawing in it.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.463
Over and over again.
You're not making any...

01:02.530 --> 01:04.498
No! Nick, he drew
what's in my head!

01:04.565 --> 01:05.666
Emily. Emily!

01:06.900 --> 01:08.102
Listen to yourself!

01:09.803 --> 01:11.105
I know what I saw.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.608
Look, I get that he's corrupt,

01:14.675 --> 01:17.145
but we don't have
any evidence, none,

01:17.211 --> 01:18.779
that he had you in
that cabin. None.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.748
How do you explain
the bleeding eye?
I don't know!

01:20.814 --> 01:23.417
I will look into it.
But, right now,
I have to take you in.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.820
BPD has issued
a warrant for you.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.225
No. No. I need more time.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.161
Do you want Flynn to see
you get arrested?

01:34.895 --> 01:36.330
Is that what you want?

01:37.064 --> 01:38.999
You should see him.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.534
Then we have to go.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.522
Hey.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.457
Hi.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.465
I told Maura and Julian
you had a work emergency.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.234
We were supposed to have dinner.

02:14.202 --> 02:17.338
Sorry. I completely forgot.

02:17.405 --> 02:20.341
I was taking Emily back.
We were working the case.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.376
Figured she could...

02:22.443 --> 02:24.378
She could tuck Flynn in.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.180
I just wanted to
check in on him.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.649
After the concussion.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.618
I understand, Emily,
but he's asleep.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.154
You can look in on him.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.458
Thank you.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.605
ALICE: You still believe her?

02:53.006 --> 02:54.875
With everything that is
staring you in the face?

02:54.942 --> 02:59.347
It's now saying in the news
that she's a suspect
in Harlow's murder.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.349
She didn't kill Harlow, Alice.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.401
NICK: Hey.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.045
Nick, can we stop
by the hotel?

04:38.111 --> 04:40.548
I need to grab a few things
before we go to county.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.966
Just make sure Flynn doesn't
listen to what people will say.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.542
I'll have the rest
sent to your dad's.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.125
You okay?
Yeah.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.267
Emily?

09:02.209 --> 09:03.243
Emily!

09:06.179 --> 09:08.849
I trusted you, now I look
like a goddamn idiot.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.884
I should charge you with aiding
and abetting a fugitive.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.320
She was only out of my sight
for a few minutes.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.323
Oh, yeah? What was she wearing
when you saw her last?

09:22.796 --> 09:24.331
Let me know when you remember.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.833
A green jacket.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.935
Black hoodie, black pants.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.837
Can I add that to your APB?

09:29.903 --> 09:32.640
What's the point

09:32.706 --> 09:34.908
She probably changed clothes
twice by now.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.360
Where are you?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.729
I'm sorry, Nick.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.931
I just couldn't face
being a captive again.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.399
I couldn't do it.
Emily, where are you?

09:59.466 --> 10:01.034
I can't tell you. You'd...

10:01.101 --> 10:02.936
You'd have to bring me back in.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.706
Running makes you look
guilty as hell.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.642
If you come to me now,
we could probably...

10:08.709 --> 10:10.410
No!

10:10.477 --> 10:12.145
I'm gonna solve this.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.281
How, Emily?

10:14.347 --> 10:16.016
How do you plan to do that?

10:17.050 --> 10:18.051
You'll see.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.757
Just don't lose faith in me.

10:24.658 --> 10:25.859
Okay?

11:03.764 --> 11:05.833
I need some batteries for this.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.135
Where have you been?

11:43.103 --> 11:45.105
Huh?

11:45.172 --> 11:47.007
You know I don't like
being kept waiting.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.276
Yes.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.415
It was on purpose.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.565
I brought you a surprise.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.034
You did?
Yes.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.135
Yeah?

12:18.972 --> 12:21.308
Why don't you go upstairs now?

12:21.374 --> 12:22.442
I'll get us a drink.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.628
Go away!

12:41.694 --> 12:43.430
Mr. Byrne, it's Detective Gibbs.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.200
Mr. Byrne?

12:47.835 --> 12:49.069
What do you want?

12:49.702 --> 12:50.938
Can you open up?

12:51.872 --> 12:53.106
No.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.608
I'm looking for your sister.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.910
JACK: Yeah, well,
she's not here.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.311
Where is she?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.380
I don't know.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.049
At a motel, somewhere.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.416
GIBBS: Which one?

13:03.483 --> 13:05.518
She didn't give me
the details, all right?

13:05.585 --> 13:06.586
She just...

13:06.653 --> 13:08.121
I'm glad to be rid of her.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.428
Listen up.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.265
If she reaches out,
just call me.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.338
She's not gonna reach out.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.077
You should go to her dad.
He's the go-to. Good luck.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.019
ALICE: You did the right thing.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.293
She escaped.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.928
ALICE: What?

14:54.995 --> 14:56.629
I don't understand.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.268
I was stopped at a light...

15:02.902 --> 15:05.438
She jumped out.
Ran off.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.075
You couldn't catch her?

15:08.141 --> 15:10.310
Don't you think I tried?

15:10.377 --> 15:12.379
Why are you getting
angry with me?

15:14.281 --> 15:15.315
Sorry.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.557
I should have cuffed her.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.000
I don't know. I thought
I could trust her.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.041
It was stupid.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.278
It was really stupid.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.492
ADAM: The Emily Byrne we knew
is gone, people.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.162
It's tragic.

16:02.229 --> 16:06.166
But whatever happened to her
during those years,
it changed her.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.800
She's violent.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.236
Dangerous.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.838
The prime suspect in
two murders.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.574
So the best thing we can
do for her is to bring her in.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.509
Safely.

16:16.576 --> 16:20.580
Now I'm going to turn it over
to Detective Gibbs,
who is running point for BPD.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.087
Yeah.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.436
What's this?

16:44.804 --> 16:46.639
What did I tell you last night?

16:47.574 --> 16:48.708
The door.

16:56.416 --> 16:59.152
I gave you a chance to open
your eyes, Nick.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.221
And you didn't.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.325
I said she was playing you
and she did.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.362
Now you gotta pay the price.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.099
Badge and gun.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.666
You're suspended.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.684
You going to join
the hunt yourself?

17:34.521 --> 17:36.656
See if you can do her
like you did Harlow?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.595
She's still in your head,
isn't she?

17:47.134 --> 17:48.435
Jesus, Nick.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.322
EMILY: Hey.
FLYNN: Why you up here?

18:42.389 --> 18:44.591
Why don't you come down?
Um...

18:46.593 --> 18:48.428
Can we talk for a second?

18:48.495 --> 18:50.330
Sure.
EMILY: Come here.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.136
Oh, man.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.406
These hands, they're cold, huh?

19:05.478 --> 19:08.715
People are going to be
saying things about me

19:08.781 --> 19:10.183
and I don't care.

19:11.918 --> 19:15.355
I just care that you know
that they are not true.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.158
I need you to believe me, okay?

19:21.127 --> 19:24.197
I believe you.
EMILY: Good. Good.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.199
Mom, what's wrong?

19:26.266 --> 19:29.269
Baby, it's hard to explain
and I don't have enough time.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.239
So, if you ever hear anything
that makes you question things,

19:32.305 --> 19:34.641
you just ask your dad.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.677
I trust him and
you can too, all right?

19:37.744 --> 19:39.712
Okay.
Okay. I love you.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.113
Do you love me?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.350
You do, huh? Good, come here.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.056
Hey. Go sit downstairs
with your friends.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.524
Okay.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.436
Have you lost your mind?

20:03.503 --> 20:05.137
Showing up here?

20:05.204 --> 20:07.240
Putting Flynn in danger?
All these kids?

20:07.307 --> 20:08.841
I have a right to see him.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.611
I'm sick of trying to make this
nightmare livable for everyone.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.413
Leave.
Or, I'll call the police.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.715
Flynn is my son.
You don't deserve him.

20:17.817 --> 20:18.951
You're hurting him.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.721
You hurt everyone around you
and you don't care?

20:21.788 --> 20:23.222
Yes. Police.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.458
Mom, please, don't do it!

20:26.326 --> 20:27.860
Mom, what's happening?

20:34.334 --> 20:37.169
REPORTER: The police
do not want the public
to approach the fugitive.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.472
Call the hotline number
at the bottom of your screen.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.140
WARREN: Shut it off, dammit!

20:41.207 --> 20:42.809
You got it all wrong.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.378
Emily's innocent.
I bet my life on it.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.913
...earlier this morning...

20:48.180 --> 20:49.882
Help me find her.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.686
The sooner we bring her in,
the sooner we clear
her of the charges.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.821
Myself...

20:55.988 --> 20:57.223
I like Emily.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.691
I want to see her get
a fair shake.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.361
Cut the crap, I know
what you're up to.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.996
I was making collars
when you were in diapers.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.798
Then, you know.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.668
The longer she's out there,
the more the
situation escalates.

21:08.735 --> 21:11.270
The less chance we have
of bringing her in safe.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.874
You could help your daughter.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.911
She hasn't come by.
I called a few times,
didn't hear back.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.686
Any family outside of Boston?
Old friends?

21:26.753 --> 21:30.957
Who's gonna take her in?
You got the whole damn media
all worked up.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.825
Making her out to be
a crazed killer.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.762
Nobody is going to help
my little girl.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.230
I understand how you feel.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.966
You understand dick.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.435
Hello?

21:42.502 --> 21:45.638
Dad?
Josie, how you doing?

21:45.705 --> 21:47.807
You can't talk. I get it. Um...

21:48.575 --> 21:50.076
I'm hanging in there.

21:51.678 --> 21:54.080
You ready for
the polka dance contest?

21:54.146 --> 21:57.750
EMILY: I don't know what to do.
There are people that
are working against me.

21:57.817 --> 22:01.253
And I think I figured out a way
out of all of this,

22:01.320 --> 22:03.055
except it's dangerous.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.457
And, uh...

22:05.658 --> 22:07.360
It might make things worse.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.697
But, I think it's
my only chance.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.933
Do it. I've always
believed in you.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.604
You've already got the moves,
I trust you know how to use 'em.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.673
Thanks.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.109
I needed to hear that,
I just... I needed...

22:25.077 --> 22:26.979
To hear your voice.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.416
I gotta go. Take care.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.752
Who was that on the phone?

22:34.020 --> 22:35.087
Josie.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.057
You know,

22:38.124 --> 22:41.060
for a guy whose little girl
is on the run...

22:42.061 --> 22:43.730
You sound damn good.

22:45.665 --> 22:48.100
Anything else... Detective?

22:49.569 --> 22:50.903
Not today.

22:53.239 --> 22:54.507
Thank you.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.778
Asshole.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.088
Nick?
NICK: Just a minute.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.971
We need to talk.
Later, okay?

23:25.037 --> 23:26.405
I'm going for a run.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.175
Why later

23:29.241 --> 23:31.210
I just need to...

23:31.277 --> 23:33.079
Clear my head.

23:33.145 --> 23:36.048
You said you needed me
to get through this?

23:36.115 --> 23:37.817
You're not acting like it.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.020
Why are you shutting me out?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.694
Just ignoring me now?

23:48.628 --> 23:50.429
I have to go, Alice.

24:11.350 --> 24:12.719
Don't move.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.688
Emily, why don't you
put the knife down?

24:15.755 --> 24:18.625
You reach for it and I will
slit your throat.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.627
Hands up.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.029
Up.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.906
Drive.
Where to?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.207
Just drive.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.711
Where are you?

25:11.778 --> 25:13.613
With Radford.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.782
I'm taking him somewhere
we can talk.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.185
Did you say you're with Radford?

25:19.251 --> 25:20.787
I've got it under control.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.593
Listen. Listen to me, Emily.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.763
Very carefully,
listen to me.

25:30.830 --> 25:33.700
Because your life literally
depends on it.

25:33.766 --> 25:37.670
You've abducted the
Special Agent in charge
of the Boston Field Office.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.706
Just like he abducted me.

25:39.772 --> 25:42.975
No, no. No. He's the
dirty agent, no question.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.013
Do I think
he killed Harlow? Maybe.

25:47.647 --> 25:48.915
But, the cabin?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.051
It doesn't add up.

25:52.719 --> 25:53.920
Think about it.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.923
He's gonna confess, you'll see.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.458
After I do to him
a bit of what he did to me.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.160
How can I get through to you?

26:01.694 --> 26:03.195
Do you...

26:03.262 --> 26:06.899
Do you want Flynn
to see you shot dead
by SWAT on TV?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.302
Is that what you want?

26:10.369 --> 26:11.704
I just want this to end.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.940
So enough, enough!

26:14.006 --> 26:15.007
Emily...

26:16.676 --> 26:18.110
Turn around.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.813
Come back.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.315
Please, Em, I'm begging you.
This is not the way.

26:26.385 --> 26:27.620

27:55.574 --> 27:59.078
Do I think he killed Harlow?
Maybe. But, the cabin?

28:13.893 --> 28:16.996
CROWN: Adam missed
a dinner appointment
with the Deputy Director.

28:17.063 --> 28:20.199
No phone call, no email apology,
nothing. Very unlike him.

28:20.266 --> 28:23.302
So, I tried tracking him down,
came up empty,

28:23.369 --> 28:26.705
that's when I called on
Detective Gibbs.

28:26.773 --> 28:30.609
We determined Radford
went to the driving range
this evening,

28:30.676 --> 28:33.145
but his car wasn't in the lot.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.414
Here's why.

28:37.950 --> 28:40.152
That's Emily Byrne.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.488
She tampered with a couple
of the lights.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.324
She was picked up
by a traffic camera on I-93,

28:45.391 --> 28:49.195
driving the junker parked
next to Radford's car.

28:49.261 --> 28:52.464
By the time security realized
the lights were out,

28:52.531 --> 28:53.900
she was outta there.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.468
With Radford.

28:56.535 --> 28:59.138
Now we have zero leads
on where they might be headed.

28:59.205 --> 29:01.640
We need to generate
some and fast.

29:01.707 --> 29:03.876
Exhaust every avenue you have.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.447
I was in her corner, too.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.984
Until she screwed me over.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.274
Look familiar?

29:40.646 --> 29:42.248
This is where I was abducted.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.352
The night that I followed
a lead on Harlow,

29:46.418 --> 29:48.520
the night that you
didn't back me up.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.961
You tipped him off, didn't you?

29:58.397 --> 29:59.498
You set me up.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.135
You're going to admit to
what you did,

30:03.202 --> 30:05.204
it's the only way
you're getting out of here.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.512
What do you think I did to you?

30:13.579 --> 30:14.981
Why did you do it, Adam?

30:15.047 --> 30:18.184
Why did you take me?
I need to know.

30:19.785 --> 30:21.487
Emily, I wasn't there.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.022
Why did you let me go?

30:24.423 --> 30:27.927
Are you framing me?
Is this some kind
of a sick game?

30:27.994 --> 30:30.229
You're the sick one here.
You're delusional.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.466
You're not thinking straight.

30:40.106 --> 30:41.908
This is our new game.

32:26.578 --> 32:27.713
Yeah?

32:27.779 --> 32:29.215
Before you hang up...

32:31.117 --> 32:32.551
What number is this?

32:32.618 --> 32:34.253
I'm calling from a burner.
They're tapping my line.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.687
Why?

32:35.754 --> 32:39.091
Never mind.
Listen, I think I know
where Emily is.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.692
GIBBS: I'm supposed
to believe you?

32:40.759 --> 32:43.362
She called me.
She said she has Radford.

32:43.429 --> 32:45.998
Any reason you're not
sharing this
with your own people?

32:46.065 --> 32:47.699
Yeah, my work situation is...

32:47.766 --> 32:48.967
Yeah,

32:49.468 --> 32:50.602
I know.

32:50.669 --> 32:51.703
I need your help.

32:52.404 --> 32:53.405
Gibbs?

32:54.806 --> 32:56.242
I'm the only lead you have.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.178
Yeah.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.885
We can leave any time you want,
you just answer my questions.

33:06.952 --> 33:08.987
What did you do?
Nothing.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.165
You did something to me.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.533
I know.
It changed me!

33:21.600 --> 33:24.470
You're insane.
You kidnapped yourself.

33:29.441 --> 33:32.010
You and Harlow were partners.
Admit it!

33:32.078 --> 33:34.646
No. You were my partner.

33:48.927 --> 33:51.563
Okay. Okay.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.032
You cooked up
a witness against me.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.403
I got Regina to lie.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.938
I made her go to the cops.

34:00.005 --> 34:01.673
To say that you
were with Semerov.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.943
I didn't know what
you remembered
and what you didn't...

34:05.010 --> 34:06.678
You bastard.

34:08.914 --> 34:11.783
The whole time
when I was working
the Semerov case,

34:11.850 --> 34:13.819
you kept him one step ahead!

34:13.885 --> 34:15.354
He cut me in.

34:16.255 --> 34:17.823
Regina laundered the money.

34:19.658 --> 34:20.659
Why did you kill him?

34:20.726 --> 34:22.461
Was it because he was going
to cut you out?

34:23.262 --> 34:24.763
I didn't kill Semerov.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.833
You killed him
and then you put
my DNA on him!

34:27.899 --> 34:29.501
No. I swear.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.969
Then who?

34:31.036 --> 34:32.704
Who planted my DNA?

34:32.771 --> 34:34.973
I don't know!

34:35.040 --> 34:38.310
The lab found your
DNA on his body.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.646
I thought for sure it was you.

34:40.712 --> 34:43.149
I thought I was helping put
a murderer in jail.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.585
Ahhh!

34:47.219 --> 34:48.754
You're the murderer.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.500
I saw the journal!

35:01.567 --> 35:04.303
I saw the eye with blood on it.

35:04.370 --> 35:07.606
I have visions, Adam.
I wanna know why?

35:07.673 --> 35:11.109
Why do you have my visions
in your journal?

35:12.811 --> 35:16.215
You wanna know why
I draw the bleeding eye?

35:16.282 --> 35:18.617
What do you think I did
after you vanished?

35:18.684 --> 35:20.952
I looked for you.

35:21.019 --> 35:22.554
Bullshit.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.157
I was trouble and
you were glad
that I was gone.

35:25.224 --> 35:28.427
No. No. It wasn't like that.

35:30.095 --> 35:36.001
I knew Harlow was involved
somehow, but I stayed
on your case.

35:36.067 --> 35:41.407
The bleeding eye
was the only clue
I could never make sense of.

35:41.473 --> 35:45.377
It haunted me. It still
haunts me. That's why
it's in my journal.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.916
I don't understand.

35:52.017 --> 35:53.485
Before we arrested him,

35:54.520 --> 35:57.489
I was trailing him
and he made a call.

35:57.556 --> 36:00.392
I don't know who
he was talking to,

36:00.459 --> 36:03.262
but, he said something
and it stuck in my mind.

36:03.329 --> 36:06.765
He said, "I'll meet you
at the bleeding eye."

36:08.267 --> 36:10.936
It's not a person, Emily.
It's a place.

36:18.076 --> 36:19.545
EMILY: A place?

36:19.611 --> 36:21.179
What do you know about it?

36:24.049 --> 36:25.317
I don't know.

36:33.759 --> 36:36.027
I just keep seeing it
ever since I got back.

36:36.094 --> 36:40.332
If you're seeing
the bleeding eye,
it means you've been there.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.635
And maybe whoever had you
took you there?

36:45.837 --> 36:47.439
Or, maybe...

36:47.506 --> 36:50.376
Your mind made
it into a vision?

36:51.410 --> 36:52.678
Think about it.

37:00.286 --> 37:01.820
It wasn't you.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.759
And it wasn't me.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.299
Then, there's somebody
else out there.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.369
They know where
the bleeding eye is.

37:27.879 --> 37:28.980
GIBBS: Right.

37:57.242 --> 37:58.544

Give yourself up.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.795
I can't.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.968
In here!

38:24.770 --> 38:26.705
Come on!

38:26.772 --> 38:28.674

No, no.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.419
You okay, man?
Yeah, you?

38:54.733 --> 38:55.601

38:55.667 --> 38:58.236
Wait, man. Nick. Nick!

39:11.683 --> 39:13.385

39:25.196 --> 39:26.498
GIBBS: Shots fired.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.099
Agent down.

39:29.401 --> 39:30.602
Yeah.
