* One, two, three, four

00:17.067 --> 00:18.533
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

00:18.567 --> 00:22.333

* Yeah, yeah,

00:41.500 --> 00:44.000
* I left better behind

00:46.300 --> 00:48.467
-What's up?
-I think your dad's in my room.

00:50.100 --> 00:51.567
-Is he hiding?

00:51.600 --> 00:53.133
Is my dad hiding?

00:53.167 --> 00:54.533
-I think he's hiding.

00:54.567 --> 00:56.767
I think if I see
your dad cry,

00:56.800 --> 00:58.100
I will also cry.

00:58.133 --> 00:59.767
I can't see
an adult man cry.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.100
-Yeah.

01:02.133 --> 01:03.833
-He shouldn't
be in my room.

01:03.867 --> 01:05.700
He doesn't know which
bits are okay to touch.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.400
You have to get him out.

01:07.433 --> 01:11.067
-I mean, I do not want
to go into your bedroom
without you.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.567
-Go.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.033
-Dad?

01:16.067 --> 01:17.200
-Alan:
Yeah?

01:17.233 --> 01:18.467
-Which bits are
okay to touch?

01:18.500 --> 01:19.633
-Zero bits.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.100
-Josh:
You okay?

01:21.133 --> 01:22.300
-Yeah.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.233
-Why are you
in Tom's room?

01:24.267 --> 01:27.567
-Um, I was just curious
about his exercise bike.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.433
-He found it
on the street.

01:29.467 --> 01:32.300
-Good find.
-Yeah.

01:32.333 --> 01:34.167
You gonna
go talk to Mae?

01:35.600 --> 01:37.333
-Oh, yeah.
I'll go over there.

01:37.367 --> 01:40.267
I was thinking of doing
some chores around here, too.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.833
-Please do not
do any chores.

01:42.867 --> 01:46.067
-I'm worried
about the gutters.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.533
-Okay.
-Arnold's dad is probably
just trying his best, you know?

01:49.567 --> 01:51.633
Most people are just
trying their best.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.133
-Yep.

01:53.167 --> 01:54.700
-Try to remember that.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.667
-Everything's gonna
be okay, yeah?

01:57.700 --> 01:59.333
-Yeah.

02:00.633 --> 02:03.433
-Say it, Dad.
Say everything's gonna be okay.

02:03.467 --> 02:05.000
-Everything's gonna be okay.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.533
-Tom?

02:08.700 --> 02:09.700
-Yeah?

02:09.733 --> 02:12.633
-Can you say that
everything is gonna be okay?

02:12.667 --> 02:14.567
-Everything is gonna be okay.

02:16.167 --> 02:17.467
-All of us.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.533
-All:
Everything is gonna be okay.

02:20.567 --> 02:21.767
-Josh:
Yeah?

02:25.433 --> 02:28.467
-I'm not going.
-Why not?

02:28.500 --> 02:31.333
-'Cause I got a lot on.
-No, you don't.

02:31.367 --> 02:33.200
-No, I don't.
But I feel like I do,

02:33.233 --> 02:34.533
and I should honor
that instinct.

02:34.567 --> 02:35.733
-Oh, Hannah.

02:35.767 --> 02:37.400
It's Arnold's birthday.

02:37.433 --> 02:39.500
-Which he's gonna
ruin forever...

02:39.533 --> 02:41.400
coming out
to his homophobic parents.

02:41.433 --> 02:44.067
-Do you want to be
a sad, lazy dyke
your whole life?

02:44.100 --> 02:46.267
-I'm just so good at it.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.433
-(sighs)

02:47.467 --> 02:50.767
Please fuck off
out of the house.

02:59.467 --> 03:01.133
-Josh:
What the hell
am I going to talk

03:01.167 --> 03:02.567
about at this party?

03:02.600 --> 03:04.433
-Tom:
I don't know.
I don't know anything.

03:04.467 --> 03:06.100
-He's gonna tell them
that he's gay,

03:06.133 --> 03:07.767
and then he's gonna
point at me and go,

03:07.800 --> 03:10.433
"That's him!
That's the guy!
-Yeah.

03:10.467 --> 03:12.333
-That's the guy
that is not a girl."
-Yeah.

03:12.367 --> 03:13.533
You're gonna
have to be like...

03:13.567 --> 03:15.233
like, a really good guy.

03:15.267 --> 03:16.567
-You think this cake's too gay?

03:16.600 --> 03:18.300
It's too gay.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.333
-Are you meant
to not be gay?

03:20.367 --> 03:21.533
You have to pretend
to be straight

03:21.567 --> 03:22.733
until he comes out?

03:22.767 --> 03:26.033
-What do I tell them
to make them think
I'm a good guy?

03:26.067 --> 03:27.400
-You want me
to brainstorm things

03:27.433 --> 03:28.633
that are good about you?

03:28.667 --> 03:29.667
-Yes!
-Really?

03:29.700 --> 03:30.800
-Yes!

03:30.833 --> 03:33.367
-Um...

03:34.733 --> 03:36.167
You don't litter.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.767
Is that...
-(both laugh)

03:37.800 --> 03:38.833
-Yeah!

03:38.867 --> 03:40.533
Oh, hi. Hi.

03:40.567 --> 03:41.833
Now, I...

03:41.867 --> 03:44.333
So, sometimes,
I put my penis

03:44.367 --> 03:46.433
in your son's butt.
-(laughs)

03:46.467 --> 03:49.200
-But also, I mean,
I do not litter!

03:49.233 --> 03:50.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know,

03:50.533 --> 03:51.800
your son, you know,
when he was small,

03:51.833 --> 03:54.533
sometimes he'd get
shy at parties
and hide under your dress.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.800
Yeah, well, I put
my dick in his butt.

03:56.833 --> 03:58.333
-Yeah.

03:58.367 --> 04:01.467
You know that one who you played
little board games with,

04:01.500 --> 04:04.033
sometimes you
pretend to lose...

04:04.067 --> 04:05.800
-Arnold loves board games.

04:05.833 --> 04:08.467
-You know that son
who you adopted

04:08.500 --> 04:12.033
and then you kept safe,
and happy, and loved?

04:12.067 --> 04:15.200
-Well, that actually
worked out really well
for me, yeah.

04:15.233 --> 04:18.233
'Cause sometimes,
I get to put my dick
in his butt.

04:18.267 --> 04:19.533
-I do not!
-(phone chimes)

04:19.567 --> 04:21.633
-I do not litter though!
-I wouldn't.

04:21.667 --> 04:22.833
I just would not.

04:22.867 --> 04:24.800
I always put the condom
wrapper in the bin.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.200
Always, always.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.200
-What? What's going on?
-Wait.

04:30.233 --> 04:33.133
-What?
-Wait, wait.

04:33.167 --> 04:35.100
-Tom, why won't
you tell me what's ha--
-Wait, wait, wait.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.100
Okay.
-Yes?

04:39.133 --> 04:41.333
-Wow. All right.

04:41.367 --> 04:43.500
You remember Christine?

04:43.533 --> 04:45.233
-Christine? Of course
I remember Christine.

04:45.267 --> 04:46.733
The boss you
touched inappropriately.

04:46.767 --> 04:47.800
You two are my everything.

04:47.833 --> 04:49.333
I ship you so hard.

04:49.367 --> 04:52.233
-She is being charged
with sexual harassment.

04:52.267 --> 04:53.467
-Stop! Because of you?

04:53.500 --> 04:56.067
-No, because of Luke and Simon.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.267
-Who is Luke
and who is Simon?

04:57.300 --> 04:58.333
-Other guys in the office

04:58.367 --> 05:00.500
who apparently also
touched her inappropriately.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.667
-How many boys are there?

05:04.700 --> 05:06.400
-Man, I really thought
I was special.

05:06.433 --> 05:07.733
-You hearing this, Hannah?

05:07.767 --> 05:09.567
-No.
-No?

05:09.600 --> 05:10.900
There he is!
Look at him!

05:10.933 --> 05:13.067
There he is, just waiting
out at the front.
I just love him!

05:13.100 --> 05:14.133
-Tom:
He's adorable.

05:14.167 --> 05:15.667
-Oh... oh, no.
What is that?

05:15.700 --> 05:18.033
-Oh, it's...

05:18.067 --> 05:19.767
a special birthday cake
for the special birthday boy.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.200
-Happy birthday.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.367
-No, no, no, no.
You can't bring that in.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.200
-Why? Is it-- is it too--
is it too gay?

05:25.233 --> 05:26.433
-No.
-It's too gay.

05:26.467 --> 05:27.800
-No. Steve does the cake always.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.100
Steve organizes the cake.

05:29.133 --> 05:30.267
It's a big weird thing.

05:31.533 --> 05:32.833
-Okay...

05:32.867 --> 05:35.300
I guess we can hide it.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.300
It's a lemon meringue
pie cake that I made.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.200
I put Italian meringue
on the outside.

05:39.233 --> 05:41.800
It was hard.
And then I decorated it
with little, um...

05:41.833 --> 05:43.200
violet flowers.

05:43.233 --> 05:44.800
But yeah, no, I guess
we'll just hide it.

05:44.833 --> 05:47.133
-Josh wants to know
if he's allowed to be be gay.
-Yeah.

05:47.167 --> 05:48.700
-You can be gay.

05:48.733 --> 05:50.367
-Should I be straight?

05:50.400 --> 05:51.800
-You can be
whatever you like.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.600
-What about me?
Should I have worn a dress?

05:53.633 --> 05:54.833
-Okay, let's just
go in, okay?

05:54.867 --> 05:56.133
-If I get to be
whatever I like,

05:56.167 --> 05:58.533
I'm gonna be--
I'm gonna tell them
I'm an investment banker.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.200
Good afternoon!

06:00.233 --> 06:02.300
Would you like
a prime mortgage?

06:02.333 --> 06:04.333
How about some cocaine?

06:04.367 --> 06:07.500
-Alan:
John, you waste
so much time sleeping, eh?

06:07.533 --> 06:09.300
Don't you?

06:09.333 --> 06:11.267
Although, I guess
that's what I'd do too

06:11.300 --> 06:13.133
if I didn't know
I was gonna die.

06:13.167 --> 06:14.500
Hey, John?

06:14.533 --> 06:16.767
You're getting on a bit,
aren't you?

06:16.800 --> 06:18.700
Not long now, I reckon.

06:20.367 --> 06:22.400
Josh will be devastated.

06:22.433 --> 06:24.233
You've been good for him.

06:26.467 --> 06:27.567
Yep.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.533
You've really
slowed down, haven't you?

06:30.567 --> 06:32.700
Hm.

06:32.733 --> 06:34.467
You're getting on.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.200
-Ah-ha!

06:36.233 --> 06:37.567
Welcome, welcome.
-Donna: Oh, they're here!

06:37.600 --> 06:40.133
-Josh, Tom, and Hannah,
these are my parents.
-Hello!

06:40.167 --> 06:42.233
-That's Donna and Bruce,
and you remember Steve.

06:42.267 --> 06:44.133
-Hi. Hi. Bruce.
And what's your name, fella?

06:44.167 --> 06:47.033
-Tom.
-Tom. Brilliant.

06:47.067 --> 06:48.433
Um... Hannah. Yeah.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.800
Lovely to meet you.
And Josh.

06:51.833 --> 06:53.433
-Hello.
-Donna: We're meeting
Arnold's friends!

06:53.467 --> 06:55.700
I mean, we never get
to meet his friends...

06:55.733 --> 06:58.033
and now he's bringing
home three at once!

06:58.067 --> 06:59.367
-I have friends.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.567
-Yeah? Like the weird
kid who pissed himself.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.133
-Hey, come on.
Play nice.

07:03.167 --> 07:04.433
-That was when
I was ten, Steve.

07:04.467 --> 07:07.233
-Ten is still quite old
to wet your pants,
isn't it, darling?

07:07.267 --> 07:09.200
Anyway, come in! Come in!

07:10.767 --> 07:12.167
-Here you go, Joshy.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.700
-So, you've got
your coffee business

07:14.733 --> 07:17.700
turning a profit,
still at Uni, and under 30.

07:17.733 --> 07:19.133
(whistles)
Huh.

07:19.167 --> 07:20.600
-Yeah, people really
like coffee.

07:20.633 --> 07:21.767
I also make sweets.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.267
Rhubarb lollipops are popular.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.067
-Oh!
-Rhubarb? Yuck.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.733
-Steve.

07:26.767 --> 07:29.600
-All right. You know...
Good on rhubarb.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.800
-It's fine. You don't
have to like rhubarb.
-Bruce: Yeah...

07:31.833 --> 07:33.267
but you know,
it's not the lollipops

07:33.300 --> 07:34.800
people keep coming
back for though, is it?

07:34.833 --> 07:37.833
-It's just a very
busy path mostly.

07:37.867 --> 07:40.400
-Oh, now, now, now.

07:40.433 --> 07:42.100
I think it might have
something to do with you.

07:42.133 --> 07:43.467
It's you.
You got charisma.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.300
That's what keeps
people coming back.

07:45.333 --> 07:47.100
-Yeah, I... I don't know.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.600
No, you trust me on that.

07:51.567 --> 07:53.300
-Okay. Yeah, sure.

07:53.333 --> 07:54.633
-(chuckles)
-(laughs nervously)

07:58.100 --> 08:00.167
-Arnold:
Steve, tell Josh about Uni.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.467
-(sighs)

08:01.500 --> 08:04.100
-Steve:
If I tell, your dad's
gonna get very...

08:04.133 --> 08:05.767
-Taking a keen interest
in the plants?

08:05.800 --> 08:07.267
-Yeah.

08:11.833 --> 08:13.333
-Plants are good.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.133
-Vital.

08:15.167 --> 08:16.633
They make air.

08:30.533 --> 08:32.733
-(phone vibrates, rings)

08:40.467 --> 08:42.200
-Hello?

08:42.233 --> 08:43.633
-Stuart:
Rose?

08:43.667 --> 08:45.100
-Yes?

08:45.133 --> 08:46.533
-It's me, Stuart.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.367
-Oh! Okay.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.233
-So how are you?

08:51.267 --> 08:53.400
-Uh, I'm fine.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.567
-Yeah?

08:54.600 --> 08:57.167
It's been such a long time
and I was just sitting here

08:57.200 --> 09:00.333
looking at me lovely roses,
so it wasn't such a big leap

09:00.367 --> 09:01.800
before I started
thinking about you.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.400
-Oh, that's very nice of you.

09:04.433 --> 09:07.033
-(laughs)

09:07.067 --> 09:09.700
Oh, you always do
make me laugh, Rose.

09:09.733 --> 09:12.200
-Really?
-Never underestimate the power

09:12.233 --> 09:14.133
of your sharp tongue
and your quick wit.

09:14.167 --> 09:15.100
-(scoffs)

09:16.633 --> 09:19.233
So what's on today then?
-Oh...

09:19.267 --> 09:22.167
few chores,
bit of gardening.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.733
What about you?
-Oh...

09:23.767 --> 09:27.233
um... my house is a mess.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.167
I haven't been very well.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.500
-Well, there's no better time
than now to sort it out.

09:31.533 --> 09:33.367
-All right.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.067
Yep.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.333
Yep, that's a good idea.

09:38.367 --> 09:39.633
All right.

09:39.667 --> 09:41.167
(chuckles)

09:49.233 --> 09:51.200
-How long ago
do you think this was taken?

09:52.367 --> 09:53.733
-Two years max.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.667
-I mean, it just could not
have been more than two years.

09:55.700 --> 09:56.867
-No.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.700
-That's too old
for Arnold to be
in a family portrait.

09:58.733 --> 10:01.133
-It's--
-It's too old!

10:03.333 --> 10:06.567
-Christine offered me
$5,000 to keep quiet.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.067
-You're getting five grand?

10:08.100 --> 10:09.300
-I'm not taking it.

10:09.333 --> 10:10.333
-Yes, you are.

10:10.367 --> 10:11.567
-No, I'm not.
That's horrible.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.767
-Yes, you are. You are.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.500
-I'm a bit weirdly
upset about it.

10:15.533 --> 10:16.667
-Did you love Christine?

10:16.700 --> 10:18.100
-No.

10:18.133 --> 10:21.067
-Well, then take
the five grand and let's
go rent a water jet pack.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.500
-Well, I guess
I better head out
and reorganize the toolshed.

10:23.533 --> 10:25.033
-Oh...

10:25.067 --> 10:27.033
I can't get the corner
of the doona

10:27.067 --> 10:28.500
into the doona cover.

10:28.533 --> 10:30.433
-Paige and I got divorced.

10:30.467 --> 10:32.700
-Oh.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.700
-Yeah.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.433
To be expected, really.

10:35.467 --> 10:37.400
She knew I left a little
piece of my heart behind

10:37.433 --> 10:38.333
when I left you.

10:38.367 --> 10:40.033
-Did you?

10:40.067 --> 10:41.333
-Yeah.

10:41.367 --> 10:42.467
Also...

10:42.500 --> 10:43.767
you know, she wasn't...

10:43.800 --> 10:45.500
she wasn't handling
my disorder.

10:47.467 --> 10:49.100
Thing is, I was
handling it fine.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.533
-You're not much
of a catch, are you, Stuart?

10:51.567 --> 10:53.667
-Oh, I'd say
we're about equal.

10:53.700 --> 10:56.067
-(chuckles)

10:59.833 --> 11:01.600
-Is Hannah okay?
-Yeah, she's fine.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.800
She just doesn't
really like parties.

11:03.833 --> 11:06.467
-I'm not sure I'm ready
to officially call
this a party.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.767
I don't want Arnold
to think that his family

11:08.800 --> 11:10.533
and three friends
is as much party

11:10.567 --> 11:12.167
as he can aspire to.
-(chuckles)

11:12.200 --> 11:13.400
-Could have done
without Steve.

11:13.433 --> 11:14.767
-He's our burden.

11:33.267 --> 11:34.633
-Um...

11:34.667 --> 11:37.600
So... so I have
made a mistake.

11:37.633 --> 11:40.433
-What?
-Yeah, I put on
your mum's wedding ring.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.267
-Why?

11:43.300 --> 11:45.433
-I-- I don't know.
-Well, get it off.

11:45.467 --> 11:47.267
-Obviously it's not
gonna come off, Arnold.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.600
Obviously, obviously.

11:48.633 --> 11:50.633
-Yeah, well-- Is this pretend?
Please stop.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.700
-It's not pretend.

11:52.733 --> 11:54.033
Did you think
I was gonna make

11:54.067 --> 11:55.800
like, a joke
about us being married?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.167
Does that sound
like a funny thing?

11:57.200 --> 11:58.133
I don't know.

11:59.367 --> 12:01.500
-What are you worried
about now, Arnold?

12:01.533 --> 12:02.633
-Look-- Hi.

12:02.667 --> 12:05.033
I've-- I've made
a weird choice.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.067
Yeah.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.333
-He was trying to be funny.
-Yeah, I'm funny.

12:08.367 --> 12:10.667
-You sure are.
It's stuck, isn't it?
-Josh. Yeah.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.200
But of course it is.
-Come here.

12:12.233 --> 12:13.533
Come, come.
-Just of course it is.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.833
-Please. Try a bit of oil on it.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.367
-Easy.
-Oops.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.400
That'll...
(grunts)

12:27.300 --> 12:28.567
-I'll Google.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.133
-At least you didn't
wet your pants.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.133
-Not yet!

12:32.167 --> 12:34.033
-What? No, don't say that!

12:34.067 --> 12:35.633
-Why does everyone always
end up in the kitchen?

12:35.667 --> 12:36.833
-Josh is funny.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.700
He put my ring on
and now it won't come off.

12:38.733 --> 12:41.800
-Oh! Oh, here.
Let me have a try.

12:41.833 --> 12:43.100
-All right,
you have a try.

12:44.467 --> 12:46.300
-Oh.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.700
-Well, this is intimate.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.467
-Look, I always tell you
don't take it off!

12:49.500 --> 12:50.667
This is what happens!

12:50.700 --> 12:52.500
-Is it?
Is this what happens?

12:52.533 --> 12:54.033
Because I've never
seen this happen.

12:54.067 --> 12:56.300
-Okay, it says
putting cold water...

12:56.333 --> 12:59.167
-Oh, just--
It's the oil.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.733
It's just making it very hard
to get any leverage.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.200
-What's going on?

13:04.233 --> 13:07.233
-Oh, Josh here got
your mother's wedding ring
stuck on his finger.

13:07.267 --> 13:08.600
-(laughs)
-Why?

13:08.633 --> 13:09.600
Why would he do that?

13:09.633 --> 13:11.700
-Josh is funny.

13:11.733 --> 13:14.267
-And a considerate fellow.
Never litters.

13:14.300 --> 13:16.600
-Steve:
Dad, does this mean
you and Josh are married then?

13:16.633 --> 13:17.800
-No, of course it doesn't.
-(laughs)

13:17.833 --> 13:18.667
-Come on.
Make yourself useful.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.500
You've got dry hands.
Give it a go.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.167
-Oh, you've got
really soft hands.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.100
-(snickers)

13:27.133 --> 13:29.133
-Can you just put it
in the ice water?
-No, no.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.067
Cold will contract it.
-Arnold: Yeah, that's
what we want.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.267
-No, we don't.
We want it to expand.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.700
-Yeah, I Googled it.
-Settle, just settle.

13:33.733 --> 13:36.100
-Please just settle, buddy.
-Arnold: Put your hand
in the ice water.

13:36.133 --> 13:38.200
-Oh! That is... it's cold.

13:38.233 --> 13:39.433
-Bruce: Not gonna work.
-Yeah.

13:39.467 --> 13:41.567
-Yeah, it might not work,
but we have to try.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.700
-Bruce:
Fine.

13:44.567 --> 13:47.233
All right, let's have a look.
-No! We need more time.

13:51.433 --> 13:54.267
-Sorry, Arnold. I just--
That's-- that's all the time.
-Just pull on it!

13:54.300 --> 13:56.267
-(grunts)
-Oh!

13:56.300 --> 13:58.100
Good job, Arnold!
-(chuckles)

13:58.133 --> 13:59.500
Hey, can I try it on?

14:04.733 --> 14:05.733
-(clucking)

14:15.600 --> 14:17.000
-You a bloke?

14:19.533 --> 14:21.500
Adele, are you a rooster?

14:24.267 --> 14:25.400
Have you told Josh?

14:28.433 --> 14:29.533
Not good, mate.

14:29.567 --> 14:30.733
Not good.

14:30.767 --> 14:31.767
No, no, no.

14:33.233 --> 14:34.600
-(clucks)

14:42.833 --> 14:45.433
-I just thought
she actually liked me.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.733
-Hmm.
-I liked being liked.

14:48.767 --> 14:51.400
But she likes everyone.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.067
Even Simon.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.400
Simon.

14:54.433 --> 14:56.200
-Well, five grand
is not enough.

14:56.233 --> 14:57.833
I'll tell you
that right now.

14:57.867 --> 15:00.500
-I don't want any money.
-(scoffs)

15:01.733 --> 15:03.267
This...

15:03.300 --> 15:05.100
This is why things
like this happen to you.

15:05.133 --> 15:06.300
They don't happen
to me, all right?

15:06.333 --> 15:08.433
People look at you,
they know they can do

15:08.467 --> 15:10.033
whatever they want
with you.

15:10.067 --> 15:11.067
You're not gonna
create a fuss.

15:11.100 --> 15:13.667
You value being easygoing,
people can see that.

15:13.700 --> 15:15.333
They see it.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.667
They do whatever is easiest
to do with you,

15:17.700 --> 15:19.500
but not for you,
all right?

15:19.533 --> 15:21.133
Stand up for yourself.

15:21.167 --> 15:22.533
Ask for ten grand.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.100
I just feel
a bit shit about it.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.500
-Well, ask for 20 grand then.

15:27.533 --> 15:29.267
Would you feel a bit shit
about having a new car

15:29.300 --> 15:31.400
or your own
share portfolio?

15:31.433 --> 15:32.700
-Probably.

15:40.533 --> 15:43.033
-You should know
I'm fine now.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.433
Better off without her.

15:44.467 --> 15:46.233
-Well, that--
that's good, Stuart.

15:46.267 --> 15:47.400
That's good.

15:47.433 --> 15:48.533
-Yeah.

15:48.567 --> 15:50.367
Free as a bird now.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.467
Available for an adventure.

15:53.633 --> 15:55.067
You available, Rose?

15:56.733 --> 15:59.400
-Uh... yeah, I suppose
that's the word for it.

16:00.433 --> 16:02.433
-All right, look...

16:02.467 --> 16:06.167
when I reflect on
what my biggest achievement is,

16:06.200 --> 16:07.700
I reflect on people.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.833
Two people specifically

16:10.867 --> 16:13.233
because my biggest achievement

16:13.267 --> 16:16.533
isn't my job, my house,
or my wife.

16:16.567 --> 16:19.833
No, my biggest achievements...

16:19.867 --> 16:21.100
my two boys.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.100
And that's why today it's...

16:24.133 --> 16:25.667
it's important.

16:25.700 --> 16:28.333
Not just for Arnold
and his lovely...

16:28.367 --> 16:30.200
lovely friends...

16:30.233 --> 16:32.200
it's also very important
for me and my legacy.

16:33.433 --> 16:35.000
So thank you, Arnold.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.233
Happy birthday, buddy.

16:37.267 --> 16:38.533
-Happy birthday.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.533
All right, Arnold, your turn.
Up you get.

16:44.267 --> 16:46.033
-Um, I don't think so.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.700
-Should I do a speech?
I could do a speech.
-Both: No.

16:47.733 --> 16:49.333
-You will not
make a speech.

16:54.700 --> 16:55.700
-Um...

16:57.800 --> 17:00.233
Thanks, everyone,
for coming.

17:00.267 --> 17:01.300
Another year older.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.167
-Yes.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.833
-(breathes heavily)

17:03.867 --> 17:05.667
I don't...

17:05.700 --> 17:07.233
I don't think I have
anything else to say.

17:07.267 --> 17:09.233
-If that's what you want,
that's fine.

17:09.267 --> 17:10.367
-Come on...
-It's fine, it's fine.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.533
-Okay. Um...

17:11.567 --> 17:15.167
Also, Mum, Dad, Steve...

17:17.100 --> 17:18.000
I love you...

17:18.033 --> 17:19.433
-Love you too, kiddo.
-Hannah: (groans)

17:19.467 --> 17:21.500
Here we go, dog.

17:21.533 --> 17:23.500
-Arnold:
I'm pretty confident
you love me too,

17:23.533 --> 17:25.067
and I have
something to tell you.

17:25.100 --> 17:26.833
I'm not sure
how you'll react.

17:26.867 --> 17:28.633
-Oh, fuck.
He's coming out.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.500
-Oh, shut up, Steve.
He's not coming out.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.500
-I hope you understand
and react with compassion,

17:32.533 --> 17:34.600
and even if you don't,
I want you to know

17:34.633 --> 17:36.600
that I love you anyway.

17:36.633 --> 17:37.800
It's...

17:37.833 --> 17:41.300
it's taken me a long time
to come to terms with it, but...

17:41.333 --> 17:43.067
I'm not attracted to girls.

17:43.100 --> 17:43.967
Um...

17:44.000 --> 17:47.400
I have no romantic
feelings for girls.

17:47.433 --> 17:50.833
I have a boyfriend, Josh,
and he's helped me realize

17:50.867 --> 17:53.400
that my best chance
at happiness...

17:53.433 --> 17:55.067
is to be honest.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.200
-Yeah, bro. We know.

17:56.233 --> 17:58.367
I used to have to delete
your porn off the computer.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.733
-Tom:
You used to delete it?
Oh, that's sweet.

18:00.767 --> 18:02.733
-I knew.
I read your diary.

18:07.233 --> 18:08.767
-All right, well...

18:08.800 --> 18:10.367
good job.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.800
Got me backed
into a corner here.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.400
Very dramatic speech.

18:15.767 --> 18:17.600
Everyone looking at me
like I'm the bad guy.

18:17.633 --> 18:19.533
We'll talk
about this later.
-Shut up, Dad!

18:19.567 --> 18:20.600
Just tell him
he's done a good job

18:20.633 --> 18:22.400
and eat some cake!
-That's-- all right, shut up.

18:22.433 --> 18:24.200
Well, you know,
it's a shock.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.500
-It isn't though, is it?

18:29.333 --> 18:31.667
-You know that
honesty is very...

18:31.700 --> 18:34.733
important to me.
To us.

18:34.767 --> 18:36.267
And you know
it's number one.

18:36.300 --> 18:37.567
I've always said that. I...

18:38.567 --> 18:39.800
you know...

18:41.500 --> 18:43.300
I just can't believe
you lied to me.

18:43.333 --> 18:46.200
-I just--
-Oh, don't interrupt.

18:46.233 --> 18:47.467
You lied.
You did.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.533
Steve...

18:50.567 --> 18:52.300
he talked
about your porn.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.367
Why is it...

18:57.400 --> 18:58.467
(sighs)

18:58.500 --> 19:01.500
that you didn't feel
that you could be open with me?

19:01.533 --> 19:03.567
That is the biggest problem.

19:09.533 --> 19:11.200
-Dad, my croquembouche!

19:11.233 --> 19:12.833
-For fuck's sake, Bruce!

19:12.867 --> 19:15.767
Why would you slap
his croquembouche?
-Oh, croquembouche!

19:20.267 --> 19:21.567
All right,
I'm gonna go.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.667
Enjoy your cake.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.133
I think it would be best
if Arnold wasn't here
when I get back.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.433
You haven't had
much to say,
have you, Josh?

19:36.867 --> 19:38.400
-No.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.133
-Hmm.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.600
-Oh, Bruce...

19:49.333 --> 19:51.567
-Is... is he kicking me out?

19:51.600 --> 19:53.200
-Don't worry, darling.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.100
You did a good job.

19:55.133 --> 19:56.567
He still loves you.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.100
He just...
forgot for a minute.

19:59.133 --> 20:00.633
-I'm just not that sure.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.067
-Look, I'll give
you some money.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.633
Go stay at Josh's
for a while.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.333
Be as gay as you like!

20:06.367 --> 20:09.667
Shower yourself
in dick and glitter.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.567
I'll look after your father.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.600
-Thanks, Mum.
-Oh, for God's sake!

20:20.733 --> 20:22.133
-Josh:
Dad?

20:23.500 --> 20:24.600
-Hi, boys.

20:24.633 --> 20:27.200
-I've never been up on the roof!
-Alan: Well, it's good.

20:27.233 --> 20:28.733
I can see the tennis courts
from up here.

20:28.767 --> 20:30.167
-Josh:
Do you wanna
go up on the roof?

20:30.200 --> 20:31.833
We can go up
on the roof.

20:31.867 --> 20:33.467
-Arnold:
Um...

20:33.500 --> 20:35.600
I'll go and get
some cutlery for the cake.

20:35.633 --> 20:36.733
-Yeah.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.300
-Adele's a rooster.

20:44.533 --> 20:45.500
-I know.

20:45.533 --> 20:47.433
-What?
What do you mean?

20:47.467 --> 20:49.333
-Adele is a man.

20:49.367 --> 20:50.600
-You're gonna have
to get rid of her.

20:50.633 --> 20:52.000
-Get rid of her?

20:53.567 --> 20:55.100
-The zoo takes roosters.

20:55.133 --> 20:56.333
They feed them
to the lions.
-(gasps)

20:56.367 --> 20:58.800
-No. No, they don't.
That's not a thing.

20:58.833 --> 21:00.367
-Yeah, they do.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.367
-Absolutely not.

21:05.867 --> 21:07.800
-How did coming out go?

21:07.833 --> 21:09.567
-Not well.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.100
-Definitely not well.
-Nope.

21:11.133 --> 21:12.433
-Arnold's dad's a douche.

21:12.467 --> 21:14.633
-Um... so actually,
I love my dad.

21:14.667 --> 21:17.167
This isn't a time
to just gang up
on my dad.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.033
-He's probably just... just...

21:19.067 --> 21:20.400
just a bit startled.

21:20.433 --> 21:22.033
-I'm happy with it.

21:22.067 --> 21:23.567
I did it.
It's his burden now.

21:25.167 --> 21:27.367
-It's not easy
being a dad.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.767
I don't think I was
really very good at being a dad.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.567
-You're a great dad!

21:31.600 --> 21:34.200
Don't you think, Josh?
-Mm...

21:34.233 --> 21:36.200
Gosh, um, yeah.

21:36.233 --> 21:38.100
I...

21:38.133 --> 21:39.700
I never really
thought about it.

21:39.733 --> 21:42.500
I mean, you're the only
dad I've ever had. I...

21:42.533 --> 21:44.567
I've never considered
whether or not you could

21:44.600 --> 21:46.533
be a better dad
the same way I've never

21:46.567 --> 21:49.300
considered whether or not...
the moon could be better.

21:50.433 --> 21:52.267
It's sort of just there.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.733
Well, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I think...

21:54.767 --> 21:57.567
Yeah, I think probably
you are a good dad.

21:57.600 --> 21:58.567
Yeah.

22:01.833 --> 22:03.833
-Sometimes I just
think I'm hopeless.

22:03.867 --> 22:06.467
-Oh. I mean, you are,
but that's okay.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.033
Everyone's hopeless.
I'm hopeless,

22:08.067 --> 22:09.600
Arnold's hopeless, Tom...

22:09.633 --> 22:11.600
Tom's hopeless.

22:11.633 --> 22:14.500
-Arnold's dad says the reason
people don't value me

22:14.533 --> 22:16.367
is because
I don't value myself.

22:17.433 --> 22:19.100
-I'm sorry.

22:19.133 --> 22:21.833
-He's right though, yeah?

22:21.867 --> 22:24.400
Like, he's just right.

22:24.433 --> 22:26.800
-Do you have trouble
being interested in sex

22:26.833 --> 22:28.400
when you're
on anti-depressants?

22:28.433 --> 22:31.033
-Sex is a chore
I always try to avoid.

22:31.067 --> 22:32.633
-Oh. What about love then?

22:32.667 --> 22:34.600
Like... (sighs)

22:34.633 --> 22:36.367
My emotions are so flat.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.000
How can I tell if I have
feelings for someone?

22:40.400 --> 22:41.633
-I know.
It's not ideal.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.033
You take medication
to get yourself out

22:43.067 --> 22:44.733
of a dark hole,
but you end up

22:44.767 --> 22:47.167
just in a display home
on an empty street.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.400
-Oh, I want to get off
the medication, Hannah.

22:51.433 --> 22:54.233
Like, I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

22:54.267 --> 22:55.700
feeling the same way
at a friend's wedding

22:55.733 --> 22:57.400
as I do
at their funeral.

22:57.433 --> 22:59.267
-Yeah, but you know
you feel like you're ready

22:59.300 --> 23:01.367
to come off medication because
the medication is working?

23:01.400 --> 23:03.467
-Mm-hmm.
-You know it stops working
when you stop taking it?

23:03.500 --> 23:04.333
-Yeah, I know.

23:05.867 --> 23:08.833
The thing is, I just took
myself off my medication,

23:08.867 --> 23:10.467
and I'm fucked.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.700
Like, fucked.

23:11.733 --> 23:13.633
It's bad.

23:13.667 --> 23:16.567
I've started
hitting myself again.
-What?

23:17.667 --> 23:19.367
Hitting yourself?

23:19.400 --> 23:21.300
-Yeah, we've all got
our things.

23:21.333 --> 23:24.100
You try and kill yourself,
I tenderize.

23:24.133 --> 23:26.800
-Hannah, I'm so sorry.

23:26.833 --> 23:29.033
What can we do about that?
-It's fine.

23:29.067 --> 23:30.167
I'm taking my meds again.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.767
I'll be beige inside
soon enough.

23:34.167 --> 23:36.833
It just really hurts to know
that I need to take pills

23:36.867 --> 23:39.533
simply to function.

23:39.567 --> 23:41.233
Really painful.

23:41.267 --> 23:43.533
I can't wait
to be beige again.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.800
-Tom:
Alan, I do just want to say

23:55.833 --> 23:57.800
that wasn't very cool
what Mae did.

23:57.833 --> 23:58.833
-Alan:
Thanks, Tom.

23:58.867 --> 24:01.067
I'm okay.

24:01.100 --> 24:03.067
I'm pretty resilient.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.433
I'm not gonna
let it break me.

24:04.467 --> 24:05.767
-Tom: No.
-Arnold: Did you know that

24:05.800 --> 24:07.233
up until the age
of, like, nine or ten,

24:07.267 --> 24:09.100
boys cry the same
amount as girls,

24:09.133 --> 24:11.200
and then society teaches
them not to cry?

24:11.233 --> 24:12.667
We're taught not to cry.

24:14.167 --> 24:16.233
You don't have to be resilient.
It's okay to break.

24:18.633 --> 24:21.367
-Well, thanks, Arnold.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.200
I'm actually just
building up the courage

24:23.233 --> 24:25.133
to go and sort it out now.
