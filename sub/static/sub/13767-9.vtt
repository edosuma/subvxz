WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:02.878
I'm home.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.212
Hi, honey.

00:04.254 --> 00:05.339
We're on our own tonight.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.215
I thought maybe

00:05.380 --> 00:07.215
we'd go out to dinner.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.300
Where are the kids?

00:08.342 --> 00:09.802
Malcolm's over at Stevie's.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.637
Reese has got hockey practice.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.765
Dewey's at Billy's...

00:11.679 --> 00:14.765
or one of the neighbor kids.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.725
So, we're on our own.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.769
What are you in the mood for?

00:23.899 --> 00:26.360
That has got to be

00:23.899 --> 00:26.360
a new record.

00:26.401 --> 00:30.071
♪ Yes, no, maybe ♪

00:30.113 --> 00:32.449

01:03.689 --> 01:05.190
There you go.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.985
People are always asking our

01:05.232 --> 01:07.985
class to volunteer for stuff.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.778
They just assume

01:08.027 --> 01:09.778
we're social rejects

01:09.820 --> 01:11.112
with nothing better to do.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.197
It's true.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.115
I just don't like having it

01:12.239 --> 01:14.115
thrown in my face.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.994
So, our school needs a kid

01:14.157 --> 01:16.994
about your age

01:17.036 --> 01:18.495
to be in our school play.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.580
It'll be a lot of fun.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.123
The play is by

01:19.621 --> 01:22.123
a guy named William Shakespeare.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.710
He was a writer way back

01:22.165 --> 01:24.710
in the olden times.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.127
He was a syphilitic drunk

01:26.169 --> 01:28.923
fronting for

01:26.169 --> 01:28.923
the 14th Earl of Oxford.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.799
Why can't you leave

01:28.964 --> 01:30.799
the Bard alone?

01:30.841 --> 01:33.802
So he didn't have the benefit

01:30.841 --> 01:33.802
of higher education.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.179
How many PhDs

01:33.844 --> 01:36.179
have written  King Lear?

01:36.221 --> 01:38.139
(all arguing)

01:38.181 --> 01:39.016
Now, now, now.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.893
Try to remember

01:39.058 --> 01:40.893
we have a guest.

01:40.935 --> 01:44.438
Let's save our heated words

01:40.935 --> 01:44.438
for Open Forum Friday.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.814
Meghan, continue.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.149
Whoever he was,

01:45.856 --> 01:48.149
he had a pointy little beard

01:48.191 --> 01:50.069
and he wrote

01:48.191 --> 01:50.069
a really good play called

01:50.110 --> 01:51.612
A Midsummer Night's Dream.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.655
We need someone to play

01:51.653 --> 01:53.655
the Changeling Boy.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.824
Okay, before anyone

01:53.697 --> 01:55.824
gets too excited,

01:55.866 --> 01:57.158
there is a downside.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.619
You'll probably

01:57.200 --> 01:58.619
have to miss class.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.161
I'll do it!

01:58.660 --> 02:00.161
He can't.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.122
We're working

02:00.203 --> 02:02.122
on a secret project that...

02:03.331 --> 02:05.834
I've said too much.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.503
Okay, I thought

02:05.876 --> 02:08.503
we agreed no more

02:08.545 --> 02:10.171
secret projects.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.841
Some of you still don't have

02:10.213 --> 02:12.841
your eyebrows back

02:12.883 --> 02:14.551
from your last secret project.

02:14.593 --> 02:15.636
I can do both.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.887
All right, just as long

02:16.929 --> 02:19.180
as you know

02:16.929 --> 02:19.180
where your priorities are.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.849
I can go now.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.350
(overlapping chatter)

02:32.527 --> 02:34.863
GIRL:

02:32.527 --> 02:34.863
Did you see her necklace? I used

02:32.527 --> 02:34.863
to think she was so boring,

02:34.905 --> 02:36.657
but now that she's

02:34.905 --> 02:36.657
bi-curious, she's just

02:36.698 --> 02:37.532
so much, I don't

02:36.698 --> 02:37.532
know, cooler.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.993
Oh, my God,

02:37.574 --> 02:38.993
that is so true.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.201
She's, like, totally

02:39.034 --> 02:40.201
changed personalities

02:40.243 --> 02:41.453
since she's

02:40.243 --> 02:41.453
been wheat-free.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.746
GIRL 1:

02:41.495 --> 02:42.746
Oh, and have

02:41.495 --> 02:42.746
you heard?

02:42.788 --> 02:44.539
Mark is totally out

02:42.788 --> 02:44.539
of that swing thing,

02:44.581 --> 02:46.207
which is so over,

02:44.581 --> 02:46.207
and into goth...

02:46.249 --> 02:47.542
Oh,  On the Road.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.796
I read that.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.796
It's a really

02:47.584 --> 02:50.796
good book.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.256
That's Travis.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.256
He has angst.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.092
Look at all these people.

02:55.134 --> 02:57.344
They're pierced,

02:55.134 --> 02:57.344
they're brooding.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.596
They're wearing weird clothes.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.807
They don't care about anything.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.267
It's like a room full

03:01.849 --> 03:04.267
of Francises.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.727
GRIEB:

03:04.309 --> 03:05.727
Okay, people...

03:05.769 --> 03:08.814
We're doing act three,

03:05.769 --> 03:08.814
scene two.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.231
Oberon! Puck!

03:10.273 --> 03:11.190
Where's my Puck?

03:11.232 --> 03:13.318
I think he has

03:11.232 --> 03:13.318
a wrestling meet.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.403
Hey, you.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.738
Changeling Boy.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.490
Can you read?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.490
Yeah.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.908
You got half

03:18.532 --> 03:19.908
these kids beat.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.242
Read Puck for the day.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.244
Page 27.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.413
(clears throat)

03:25.455 --> 03:28.500
"This is thy negligence.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.045
"Still thou mistak'st

03:31.086 --> 03:35.799
"Or commit'st

03:31.086 --> 03:35.799
thy knaveries willfully.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.926
"Believe me, king of shadows,

03:35.841 --> 03:37.926
I mistook.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.012
"Did not you tell me

03:37.968 --> 03:40.012
I should know the man

03:40.054 --> 03:41.972
"by the Athenian garments

03:40.054 --> 03:41.972
he had on?

03:42.014 --> 03:44.307
"And so far blameless

03:42.014 --> 03:44.307
proves my enterprise.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.394
"That I have 'nointed

03:44.349 --> 03:47.394
an Athenian's eyes.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.436
And so far..."

03:48.478 --> 03:50.189
You went from a

03:48.478 --> 03:50.189
part with no lines

03:50.271 --> 03:52.273
to the lead in the

03:50.271 --> 03:52.273
high school play?

03:52.315 --> 03:53.067
Oh, that's great.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.442
It's not a musical,

03:53.108 --> 03:54.442
is it?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.319
No.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.319
That's great.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.863
Dude, you play a fairy?

03:57.905 --> 03:58.989
Not just any

03:57.905 --> 03:58.989
fairy, Reese.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.282
He's the biggest fairy

03:59.031 --> 04:01.282
in the whole play.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.283
I am so proud of you.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.535
Rehearsals are

04:02.325 --> 04:03.535
every night.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.453
You have to get me there

04:03.577 --> 04:05.453
by 5:00.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.580
Every night?

04:06.621 --> 04:08.289
Oh, yeah, we build sets

04:06.621 --> 04:08.289
on the weekends.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.542
Okay, we can do this.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.542
If I go into work early,

04:10.584 --> 04:13.545
I can get off in enough time

04:10.584 --> 04:13.545
to drop you off at rehearsal

04:13.587 --> 04:14.838
before I take Reese to hockey--

04:14.880 --> 04:16.590
except the days

04:14.880 --> 04:16.590
Reese has detention.

04:16.631 --> 04:17.883
And then Dewey's

04:16.631 --> 04:17.883
home alone.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.051
I'll take care of it.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.635
I can rearrange my schedule

04:19.093 --> 04:20.635
for a couple weeks.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.888
It'll be fun spending

04:20.677 --> 04:22.888
some time together.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.098
Can we run over things

04:22.930 --> 04:24.098
in the car

04:24.139 --> 04:26.225
like we did last time?

04:24.139 --> 04:26.225
Da-da-shh...

04:26.808 --> 04:29.978
It was already dead.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.773
Hmm, this is your best

04:30.020 --> 04:32.773
guacamole yet, Joe.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.026
Thanks. The secret

04:32.814 --> 04:36.026
is fresh lime juice.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.026
Yeah.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.904
Commandant on the floor.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.905
SPANGLER:

04:38.946 --> 04:39.905
No, no...

04:39.947 --> 04:41.990
Please don't let me disturb you.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.951
Make yourselves at home.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.080
Wait a minute.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.499
This is not your home.

04:51.541 --> 04:57.380
This is not your

04:51.541 --> 04:57.380
mama's house.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.673
There's no maid here

04:58.715 --> 05:00.300
to clean up your toys,

05:00.341 --> 05:04.304
and, yet, as I look around

05:00.341 --> 05:04.304
this institution of learning,

05:04.345 --> 05:07.515
I see video games,

05:04.345 --> 05:07.515
I see girlie magazines.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.310
And I see Garth...

05:10.351 --> 05:15.398
Garth Vader defiling our

05:10.351 --> 05:15.398
Wall of Remembrance.

05:15.440 --> 05:21.155
Well, clearly things

05:15.440 --> 05:21.155
have gotten a little lax

05:15.440 --> 05:21.155
around here.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.158
I blame myself,

05:21.196 --> 05:24.158
but it is you who will suffer.

05:24.199 --> 05:27.035
From now on, there will be

05:24.199 --> 05:27.035
weekly inspections.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.622
And you will relinquish

05:27.077 --> 05:30.622
all non-standard-issue

05:30.664 --> 05:32.958
personal effects and artwork.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.460
It is time for you to learn

05:33.000 --> 05:35.460
that true happiness

05:35.502 --> 05:37.879
comes from within.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.924
Is that why you're

05:37.921 --> 05:40.924
so happy, sir?

05:40.966 --> 05:44.761
I'm as giddy

05:40.966 --> 05:44.761
as a schoolgirl, Cadet.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.345
Okay, spaghetti,

05:46.387 --> 05:48.431
toilet cleaner,

05:46.387 --> 05:48.431
glitter for Malcolm's costume...

05:48.473 --> 05:49.516
I think that's it.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.392
Oh, my God, is that right?

05:51.434 --> 05:53.270
What time do you have?

05:53.312 --> 05:54.271
Uh, 5:45.

05:54.313 --> 05:55.396
5:45?

05:55.981 --> 05:57.983
That's not possible. I...

05:58.025 --> 05:59.567
dropped off Malcolm,

05:58.025 --> 05:59.567
picked up Reese.

05:59.609 --> 06:03.155
Dinner's in the oven.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.405
Huh.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.199
What is it?

06:05.240 --> 06:08.451
I have the next 25 minutes free.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.162
How did you

06:08.493 --> 06:10.162
manage that?

06:10.204 --> 06:12.413
Did you leave

06:10.204 --> 06:12.413
a kid somewhere?

06:12.455 --> 06:17.418
No, no, they're, they're

06:12.455 --> 06:17.418
all accounted for.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.420
What are you going to do?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.798
I don't know.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.718
Huh? Yeah, um...

06:24.759 --> 06:27.721
I don't know.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.681
So this goes here?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.725
Yeah, and that

06:29.723 --> 06:31.725
should do it.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.894
Hey, these were in English.

06:33.935 --> 06:34.895
This is nice.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.939
Never looks like the box

06:34.936 --> 06:37.939
when I do it alone.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.107
Me either.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.235
We make a good team.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.698
All right.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.908
You start on Main Street.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.117
I'll do University Place

06:49.159 --> 06:51.536
and we'll meet at the bistro,

06:49.159 --> 06:51.536
say... noon-ish?

07:00.628 --> 07:01.922
Would you like a massage?

07:01.963 --> 07:03.257
Oh, I don't know.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.759
I'm really not

07:03.298 --> 07:05.759
a massage person.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.595
It only takes 15 minutes.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.264
Well...

07:10.305 --> 07:12.599
I do have some time to kill.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.019
I am not taking

07:14.309 --> 07:16.019
off my shirt.

07:16.061 --> 07:19.231
And I'm warning you,

07:16.061 --> 07:19.231
I've never been hypnotized.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.441
And I've never been relaxed.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.987
Hmm.

07:26.029 --> 07:29.449
That actually feels...

07:32.035 --> 07:33.787
...feels...

07:33.828 --> 07:35.997
pretty good.

07:40.001 --> 07:43.213
(weeping)

07:46.425 --> 07:49.094
"Pleading for a lover's fee

07:49.136 --> 07:50.678
"Shall we their

07:49.136 --> 07:50.678
fond pageant see?

07:50.720 --> 07:53.390
"Lord, what fools

07:50.720 --> 07:53.390
these mortals be!"

07:53.432 --> 07:56.226
I am very upset

07:53.432 --> 07:56.226
with you, Malcolm.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.519
You've made me care again.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.687
(girls giggling)

07:59.729 --> 08:01.315
Malcolm, that was terrific.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.191
God, I'd give anything

08:01.356 --> 08:03.191
to be as good as you.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.110
I mean, if you're

08:03.233 --> 08:05.110
this good now,

08:05.152 --> 08:08.113
imagine how amazing you're

08:05.152 --> 08:08.113
going to be when you're 15.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.532
And think of how cute

08:08.155 --> 08:11.532
he's going to be

08:08.155 --> 08:11.532
when he's 15.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.867
(all giggle)

08:12.909 --> 08:14.786
Oh, my God.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.786
Did I just giggle?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.288
STEVIE:

08:14.828 --> 08:16.288
Did you just...

08:16.330 --> 08:17.622
giggle?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.791
Stevie, what are you

08:17.664 --> 08:19.791
doing here?

08:19.833 --> 08:20.792
You missed...

08:20.834 --> 08:23.670
(breathlessly):

08:20.834 --> 08:23.670
the meeting.

08:23.711 --> 08:27.007
You're jeopardi...

08:27.048 --> 08:29.550
zing...

08:29.592 --> 08:31.845
our project.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.555
Great. See you in class.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.100
I wonder if I could just

08:34.597 --> 08:37.100
go straight to high school?

08:37.142 --> 08:39.436
I've been told skipping grades

08:37.142 --> 08:39.436
stunts you socially,

08:39.478 --> 08:41.271
but I think I've been lied to.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.608
But, sir, that's a photo

08:43.315 --> 08:45.608
of my sister.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.444
To you she's your sister.

08:47.486 --> 08:50.571
To the other cadets

08:47.486 --> 08:50.571
she's a... distraction.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.616
Now, if you need me to go

08:50.613 --> 08:53.616
into more detail on that,

08:53.658 --> 08:55.160
I will.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.578
How long are those sideburns,

08:55.202 --> 08:57.578
Cadet?

08:58.913 --> 09:01.082
This is crazy.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.709
Even prisoners

09:01.124 --> 09:02.709
can have photographs.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.170
Spangler's trying to take away

09:02.750 --> 09:05.170
the things that remind us

09:05.212 --> 09:06.838
we're still human.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.589
Francis, don't

09:06.880 --> 09:08.589
rock the boat.

09:08.631 --> 09:09.549
I don't care anymore.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.843
It's time to take

09:09.590 --> 09:11.843
a last desperate stand

09:11.885 --> 09:13.678
for individuality

09:11.885 --> 09:13.678
and freedom!

09:20.810 --> 09:22.854
LOIS:

09:20.810 --> 09:22.854
Malcolm! Reese!

09:20.810 --> 09:22.854
Get a move on!

09:22.896 --> 09:24.147
Oh, good God, Hal,

09:24.189 --> 09:26.691
when are you going

09:24.189 --> 09:26.691
to clean this up?

09:26.733 --> 09:28.068
Malcolm! Reese!

09:26.733 --> 09:28.068
Let's go!

09:28.109 --> 09:30.987
Honey, I promised Dewey

09:28.109 --> 09:30.987
I'd spend time with him.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.864
This must have cost a fortune.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.991
Oh...

09:32.906 --> 09:34.991
we'll talk about this later.

09:35.033 --> 09:38.328
Some of us have

09:35.033 --> 09:38.328
places to be!

09:41.331 --> 09:43.917
So, Dewey, I'm thinking

09:41.331 --> 09:43.917
our little community

09:43.958 --> 09:44.876
can use a school.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.086
Don't need it.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.921
Everyone's born smart.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.173
Oh, that's beautiful, son.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.508
It's a utopia.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.677
And anyone stupid

09:51.550 --> 09:54.677
will be ground up for food.

09:54.719 --> 09:55.887
Ah...

09:55.929 --> 09:57.764
a cannibal utopia.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.599
Interesting.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.355
Oh, you're still here?

10:05.397 --> 10:07.815
I was just doing

10:05.397 --> 10:07.815
some shopping

10:07.857 --> 10:10.318
and I thought

10:07.857 --> 10:10.318
while I was here,

10:10.360 --> 10:13.613
you know, I'd,

10:10.360 --> 10:13.613
I'd stop over and say "hi."

10:16.950 --> 10:18.826
Oh, my God.

10:18.868 --> 10:22.038
How do you do that?

10:22.080 --> 10:24.332
Release points.

10:24.374 --> 10:27.710
This one

10:24.374 --> 10:27.710
releases the mind.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.548
This one

10:27.752 --> 10:31.548
releases the heart.

10:31.590 --> 10:37.678
And you know

10:31.590 --> 10:37.678
what this one does.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.141
Wow.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.685
(kids talking)

10:44.727 --> 10:47.147
We need... to talk.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.483
You've missed our

10:47.188 --> 10:49.483
last five secret meetings,

10:49.524 --> 10:51.943
and our test-run's

10:49.524 --> 10:51.943
in less than 20 minutes.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.694
Why do you hate us?

10:53.736 --> 10:55.363
Guys, I don't hate you.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.365
I've just been really busy.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.950
We're still friends.

10:58.992 --> 10:59.826
Really?

10:59.867 --> 11:00.952
Of course.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.496
So, you're not bailing

11:00.994 --> 11:02.496
on the project?

11:02.537 --> 11:04.498
No.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.498
Then you have

11:02.537 --> 11:04.498
the final figures?

11:04.539 --> 11:06.374
Yeah, I worked on them

11:04.539 --> 11:06.374
all night after rehearsal.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.667
They're in my desk.

11:10.795 --> 11:11.630
Here.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.506
(sniffing)

11:12.547 --> 11:15.091
It was the other kids

11:12.547 --> 11:15.091
who doubted you.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.717
Hey, Malcolm...

11:16.759 --> 11:18.052
You need a ride?

11:18.094 --> 11:19.887
I got to go.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.598
Come on, get in.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.600
Hi, Malcolm.

11:23.642 --> 11:24.683
Hey.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.482
She's distracted.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.275
We have to do it now.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.819
The program is running.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.241
Let's light this candle.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.536
Ignition...

11:42.577 --> 11:45.746
in...

11:45.788 --> 11:49.750
five...

11:49.792 --> 11:53.672
four...

11:53.712 --> 11:55.714
three...

11:59.802 --> 12:00.803
ALL:

11:59.802 --> 12:00.803
Yeah!

12:00.845 --> 12:02.681
Blast off.

12:02.721 --> 12:07.268
Its trajectory

12:02.721 --> 12:07.268
seems rather peculiar.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.857
(all laughing)

12:12.899 --> 12:16.735
(screaming)

12:17.736 --> 12:19.656
Okay, there are any number

12:17.736 --> 12:19.656
of reasons

12:19.698 --> 12:21.366
why that might have gone wrong.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.743
Where...

12:21.408 --> 12:24.743
is it?

12:26.871 --> 12:29.790
(all scream)

12:26.871 --> 12:29.790
Take cover!

12:31.167 --> 12:33.461
I work hard, too.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.963
But I manage to make

12:33.503 --> 12:35.963
it to the Lamaze class.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.759
(all screaming)

12:47.892 --> 12:50.353
We had a vote. We want you

12:47.892 --> 12:50.353
to get rid of the plant.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.063
You're going

12:50.395 --> 12:52.063
to get us all in trouble

12:52.105 --> 12:53.814
with this little stunt of yours.

12:53.856 --> 12:54.941
This isn't a stunt.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.859
It's an act of defiance.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.612
It's a plant.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.821
Can't you see

12:58.653 --> 13:00.821
this isn't about a plant?

13:00.863 --> 13:03.824
It's about fighting tyranny,

13:00.863 --> 13:03.824
fascism and oppression.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.826
When Spangler sees this,

13:03.866 --> 13:05.826
he'll know

13:05.868 --> 13:08.829
that he didn't crush our spirit

13:05.868 --> 13:08.829
and he never will.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.081
It's not worth the risk.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.750
Once again, it looks

13:11.790 --> 13:15.836
like I'm the only man

13:11.790 --> 13:15.836
around here.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.213
I can't believe

13:15.878 --> 13:17.213
Nicole's wearing

13:15.878 --> 13:17.213
a dress like that.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.715
You can totally

13:17.255 --> 13:18.715
see her navel.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.091
If she wants to be a slut,

13:18.757 --> 13:20.091
that's fine,

13:20.133 --> 13:21.301
but don't make me lose my lunch.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.301
I know.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.843
She's, like, totally trying

13:21.342 --> 13:22.843
to impress David,

13:22.885 --> 13:24.638
but the way he's all up

13:22.885 --> 13:24.638
in Brenda's business,

13:24.679 --> 13:26.013
she didn't have a chance.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.724
I can't believe how deep

13:26.055 --> 13:27.724
our conversations are getting.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.309
You're never gonna believe

13:29.350 --> 13:31.018
what I heard about Josh,

13:29.350 --> 13:31.018
but you can't tell anyone.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.979
I overheard his stepsister

13:31.060 --> 13:32.979
while I was in the bathroom.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.105
His half-sister

13:33.020 --> 13:34.105
or stepsister?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.398
No, his stepsister.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.941
That's why he can

13:35.440 --> 13:36.941
have a crush on her.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.610
Ew.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.321
They were just talking

13:39.569 --> 13:41.321
about me, weren't they?

13:41.362 --> 13:42.863
No. We were talking

13:41.362 --> 13:42.863
about Josh.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.741
Oh, my God. His father,

13:42.905 --> 13:44.741
like, totally went down

13:44.783 --> 13:46.117
after catching him

13:44.783 --> 13:46.117
in the hot tub

13:46.159 --> 13:47.868
with his stepsister,

13:46.159 --> 13:47.868
but you know what?

13:47.910 --> 13:49.870
I don't even think

13:47.910 --> 13:49.870
he knows the whole story.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.956
Whoops, that's my cue.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.833
I feel guilty having so much fun

13:51.998 --> 13:54.833
at ditching the Krelboynes,

13:54.875 --> 13:56.753
but I'm sure they're doing fine

13:54.875 --> 13:56.753
without me.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.172
You boys are just lucky

13:56.795 --> 13:59.172
no one called the police.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.132
You can't prove

13:59.213 --> 14:01.132
there's any correlation

14:01.174 --> 14:02.550
between our

14:01.174 --> 14:02.550
rocket exploding

14:02.592 --> 14:04.885
and Caroline giving birth

14:02.592 --> 14:04.885
in the parking lot.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.971
She and the baby are fine.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.807
Thanks for asking.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.643
And the... rocket?

14:16.439 --> 14:19.900
Oh, God,

14:16.439 --> 14:19.900
then it's true.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.068
(sobs)

14:29.202 --> 14:30.453
It's finished.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.373
A perfect society.

14:33.414 --> 14:37.794
We have done what

14:33.414 --> 14:37.794
5,000 years of so-called

14:33.414 --> 14:37.794
civilization couldn't do.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.921
We've created a

14:37.836 --> 14:40.921
world that works.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.923
"We"?

14:46.969 --> 14:50.807
You want to destroy

14:46.969 --> 14:50.807
it, don't you?

14:50.849 --> 14:51.808
Yeah.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.602
Well, I appreciate

14:51.850 --> 14:54.602
that you haven't.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.021
You've shown a lot

14:54.644 --> 14:57.021
of restraint.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.939
Here.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.775
Enjoy.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.321
Oh, honey, uh, look, I know

15:02.276 --> 15:05.321
we got a little carried away,

15:05.363 --> 15:06.740
but this is it,

15:05.363 --> 15:06.740
I promise.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.449
That's okay. I'm going

15:06.781 --> 15:08.449
grocery shopping.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.034
Didn't you just go

15:08.491 --> 15:10.034
grocery shopping?

15:10.076 --> 15:11.911
Yeah, sure.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.911
No problem.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.002
Thank you.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.002
Where's Mr. Li?

15:20.044 --> 15:21.003
Excuse me?

15:21.045 --> 15:22.630
The massage guy.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.630
Where is he?

15:22.672 --> 15:24.632
Oh. He's not working

15:22.672 --> 15:24.632
here anymore.

15:24.674 --> 15:25.508
What do you mean?

15:25.550 --> 15:26.634
That's impossible.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.469
He would never leave

15:26.676 --> 15:28.469
without telling me.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.971
Well, I could try to find out

15:28.511 --> 15:30.971
where he moved to.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.974
So he could leave me again?

15:34.016 --> 15:35.894
Forget it! It's over!

15:39.480 --> 15:40.690
I heard John

15:39.480 --> 15:40.690
has a new piercing.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.108
I'll give you

15:40.732 --> 15:42.108
three guesses where,

15:42.149 --> 15:43.860
and it's not the ear

15:42.149 --> 15:43.860
or belly button.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.111
Well, Julie would know.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.111
She went camping with him

15:45.152 --> 15:46.279
when her boyfriend

15:45.152 --> 15:46.279
was out of town.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.572
John takes all the girls camping

15:46.320 --> 15:47.572
and he tries

15:47.614 --> 15:49.156
to convince them

15:47.614 --> 15:49.156
to go skinny-dipping with him,

15:49.198 --> 15:51.492
but I think seeing John naked

15:49.198 --> 15:51.492
would turn me off guys forever.

15:51.534 --> 15:52.993
Oh, you know what

15:51.534 --> 15:52.993
we should totally do?

15:53.035 --> 15:54.662
We should totally have a pool

15:53.035 --> 15:54.662
party at my house on Saturday.

15:54.704 --> 15:55.872
Malcolm, want to come?

15:54.704 --> 15:55.872
Yeah. Wait.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.458
I have something

15:55.914 --> 15:58.458
to do on Saturday.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.751
Oh, yeah, the play.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.468
Live, live, die.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.385
Live, live,

16:09.427 --> 16:12.722
live, live, die.

16:12.764 --> 16:15.475
Hey, what happened

16:12.764 --> 16:15.475
to the judicial system

16:15.516 --> 16:18.311
presided over by a tribunal

16:15.516 --> 16:18.311
of wise elders?

16:18.352 --> 16:20.187
I had 'em lined up and shot.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.022
Ah.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.150
You know, son,

16:24.191 --> 16:26.026
maybe you've been

16:24.191 --> 16:26.026
spending too much...

16:26.068 --> 16:27.027
Silence!

16:27.069 --> 16:28.988
Seize him!

16:36.579 --> 16:39.290
All right, son,

16:36.579 --> 16:39.290
I think it's time

16:39.332 --> 16:41.709
you goose-stepped off

16:39.332 --> 16:41.709
to bed.

16:41.751 --> 16:46.046
Dad! You're embarrassing me

16:41.751 --> 16:46.046
in front of my men.

16:47.173 --> 16:51.427
Hal! Why is this still here?!

16:51.469 --> 16:53.095
(Lois screaming)

16:53.137 --> 16:54.681
(screaming)

17:02.438 --> 17:05.149
(sustained howling)

17:26.587 --> 17:28.047
Ow.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.885
No fair! You did it

17:28.882 --> 17:31.885
without me?

17:33.011 --> 17:35.763
Spangler's coming.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.763
Lose the plant.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.098
Time has come.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.098
We're drawing the line.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.600
This is our Alamo.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.352
Well, that's a bad example,

17:41.394 --> 17:42.478
but you know what I mean.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.063
Ten-hut!

17:47.149 --> 17:49.694
This is more like it.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.363
Everything shipshape.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.448
The commanding officer enters

17:54.490 --> 17:56.868
and is greeted

17:54.490 --> 17:56.868
by straightened backs

17:56.910 --> 17:59.078
and the crack of shoe leather.

18:01.664 --> 18:04.042
Now I know it's been

18:01.664 --> 18:04.042
a rough couple of days,

18:04.083 --> 18:06.627
but you will agree,

18:04.083 --> 18:06.627
we are the better for it.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.128
We are a lean, mean

18:08.170 --> 18:10.214
learning machine.

18:10.256 --> 18:14.010
Now, I know that some of you

18:10.256 --> 18:14.010
think that I'm a sadist,

18:14.052 --> 18:16.095
but someday you will thank me.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.723
Man, that's brutal.

18:18.765 --> 18:22.018
Is there anything we can do

18:18.765 --> 18:22.018
to cheer you up?

18:22.060 --> 18:25.021
Do you have any more pictures

18:22.060 --> 18:25.021
of your sister?

18:25.063 --> 18:28.148
I give him curses,

18:25.063 --> 18:28.148
yet he gives me love.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.235
O that my prayers

18:28.190 --> 18:31.235
could such affection move!

18:31.277 --> 18:32.445
Hal, please, stop.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.863
You're making it worse.

18:33.905 --> 18:36.407
The more I love,

18:33.905 --> 18:36.407
the more he hateth me.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.118
His folly, Helena,

18:36.449 --> 18:39.118
is no fault of mine.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.662
You okay, sport?

18:41.704 --> 18:42.914
You can play no part

18:41.704 --> 18:42.914
for Pyramus

18:42.956 --> 18:44.832
for Pyramus is a proper man

18:42.956 --> 18:44.832
as one shall see

18:44.874 --> 18:46.292
in a summer's day.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.418
Therefore you must...

18:47.460 --> 18:48.753
Why are we here?

18:48.795 --> 18:50.546
Malcolm betrayed us.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.173
If you love

18:50.588 --> 18:53.173
something,

18:50.588 --> 18:53.173
let it go.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.677
Save your cat poster philosophy

18:53.215 --> 18:56.677
for someone else.

18:56.719 --> 19:01.724
We're taking...

18:56.719 --> 19:01.724
the high road.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.851
We will meet

19:01.766 --> 19:03.851
and there we may...

19:03.893 --> 19:04.978
But you were totally

19:03.893 --> 19:04.978
scamming together?

19:05.019 --> 19:06.270
No. We were

19:05.019 --> 19:06.270
just smacking.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.522
She claims she was just

19:06.312 --> 19:08.522
"hanging out" with Andrew

19:08.564 --> 19:10.274
at the party, but they

19:08.564 --> 19:10.274
were really hooking up.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.776
I can't believe

19:10.316 --> 19:11.776
she would...

19:11.818 --> 19:13.861
Enough. Hold,

19:11.818 --> 19:13.861
or cut both strings.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.697
Was that my cue?

19:13.903 --> 19:16.697
Quick, lower me.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.749
GIRLS:

19:25.247 --> 19:26.749
Oh, my God, that is so true.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.375
Think of how cute

19:26.791 --> 19:28.375
he's going to be...

19:28.417 --> 19:29.669
You can totally see her navel.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.211
If she wants to be a slut,

19:29.710 --> 19:31.211
that's fine,

19:31.253 --> 19:32.212
but don't make me lose

19:31.253 --> 19:32.212
my lunch.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.923
(audience murmuring)

19:37.135 --> 19:39.095
I'm totally not calling her

19:37.135 --> 19:39.095
back until she apologizes.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.347
By being her friend,

19:39.137 --> 19:41.347
I enable her assy behavior.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.599
(audience murmuring)

19:43.641 --> 19:46.936
This must be one of those times

19:43.641 --> 19:46.936
where it feels like an eternity

19:46.978 --> 19:48.938
but only a few seconds

19:46.978 --> 19:48.938
have gone by.

19:48.980 --> 19:52.817
How come Malcolm

19:48.980 --> 19:52.817
hasn't said anything

19:48.980 --> 19:52.817
for five minutes?

19:57.279 --> 19:58.531
Line.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.784
Normally, I would enjoy

19:58.572 --> 20:01.784
the  schadenfreude,

20:01.826 --> 20:03.619
but this is just sad.

20:03.661 --> 20:04.704
Psst.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.247
How now, spirit?

20:04.745 --> 20:07.247
Wither wander you?

20:07.289 --> 20:08.499
How now, spirit?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.250
Wither wander you?

20:10.292 --> 20:13.379
(garbled voices echoing)

20:13.420 --> 20:14.922
GIRLS:

20:13.420 --> 20:14.922
Ew!

20:14.964 --> 20:16.215
MAN:

20:14.964 --> 20:16.215
Who is that kid?

20:18.300 --> 20:22.722
The King doth keep his revels

20:18.300 --> 20:22.722
here tonight.

20:22.763 --> 20:26.976
The King doth keep

20:22.763 --> 20:26.976
his revels here tonight.

20:30.188 --> 20:32.523
So, good night

20:30.188 --> 20:32.523
unto you all.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.984
Give me your hands

20:32.565 --> 20:34.984
if we be friends

20:35.026 --> 20:38.362
and Robin shall

20:35.026 --> 20:38.362
restore amends.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.410
It's over?

20:44.451 --> 20:46.746
But you promised me

20:44.451 --> 20:46.746
partial nudity.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.288
Yeah, that

20:46.787 --> 20:48.288
was a lie.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.540
And the ice cream after?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.125
That, too.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.090
(audience cheering)

20:57.798 --> 21:00.009
(applause stops)

21:09.852 --> 21:12.230
(grunting)

21:16.067 --> 21:18.069
(grunting harder)

21:18.111 --> 21:20.113
(sighs)

21:20.154 --> 21:22.281
(sighs)

21:23.365 --> 21:24.324
How now, spirit?

21:24.366 --> 21:25.325
Wither wonder you?

21:25.367 --> 21:28.579
The King doth keep his revels

21:25.367 --> 21:28.579
here tonight.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.997
I knew I knew it!

21:30.039 --> 21:32.583
Take heed the Queen come not

21:30.039 --> 21:32.583
within his sight

21:32.625 --> 21:34.334
for Oberon is passing fell

21:32.625 --> 21:34.334
and wrath

21:34.376 --> 21:37.130
because that she, as her

21:34.376 --> 21:37.130
attendant, hath a lovely boy

21:37.171 --> 21:38.589
stolen from the Indian king;

21:38.631 --> 21:40.299
She never had

21:38.631 --> 21:40.299
so sweet a changeling.
