00:00.000 --> 00:01.540
(dramatic music)

00:01.640 --> 00:04.500
- August is like the perfect sperm donor.

00:04.600 --> 00:05.660
I'll be the dad.

00:05.760 --> 00:06.620
This is our child.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.020
- I'm not gonna sugar coat the situation.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.100
At your age, chances of a
live birth are around 5%.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.200
- 5%.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.560
- [Rachel] Some women are not meant to
be mothers and you're one of 'em.

00:17.640 --> 00:21.060
- This is about my family
and that's not you.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.340
- [Roger] It's okay.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.580
- Get off of her!

00:23.680 --> 00:24.420
- I am!

00:24.520 --> 00:25.260
(blood gushing)

00:25.360 --> 00:26.100
(Roger screams)

00:26.200 --> 00:28.320
- The second that we heard the screams
we all ran in to the control room.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.180
- That's not even true.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.580
- [Rachel] I have the proof Jay.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.460
- You doctored the footage.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.540
- Maya was like full
on obsessed with Roger.

00:34.640 --> 00:35.660
- [All] Lock her up.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.300
Lock her up.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.260
- To hell with being a producer.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.340
You're the sue Triss.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.500
- This video's going
somewhere I didn't expect.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.060
This is our producer, Rachel Goldberg.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.820
She's just here for herself.

00:48.920 --> 00:49.660
- Marry me.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.240
(tense music)

00:53.440 --> 00:54.180
- I want out.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.760
(tense music)

01:00.920 --> 01:03.520

02:11.480 --> 02:12.220
- Okay.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.060
Now that Quinn's gone we can
finally get down to business.

02:15.160 --> 02:18.100
Set this place up for maximum efficiency.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.500
Move in a king sized bed right here.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.460
- Yeah I mean we can be America's you know

02:22.560 --> 02:24.900
first two person reality TV sweatshop.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.140
- No I'm serious.

02:26.240 --> 02:29.180
All this time wasted
commuting, eating, sleeping.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.260
I'm just saying we should be packing

02:31.360 --> 02:32.940
in as much development and production

02:33.040 --> 02:35.980
in the next couple years
before we have kids.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.620
- Kids?

02:37.720 --> 02:38.780
(Tommy laughs)

02:38.880 --> 02:40.700
- You're so easy.

02:40.800 --> 02:41.740
We can talk about kids later.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.340
It's not a deal breaker.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.700
Listen, I was um picking up rings from

02:45.800 --> 02:48.740
our diamond guy for the finale and uh,

02:48.840 --> 02:51.080
well, I uh, I got you this.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.500
- Tommy you shouldn't have.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.020
- I want to weight that finger now.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.800
(serious music)

03:16.000 --> 03:16.740
You okay?

03:16.840 --> 03:20.020
(serious music)

03:20.120 --> 03:24.300
- I just never thought
that I would be this girl.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.140
(laughs)

03:25.240 --> 03:27.880
(serious music)

03:29.840 --> 03:30.580
(door opens)

03:30.680 --> 03:32.260
- Uh, sorry to interrupt whatever is,

03:32.360 --> 03:34.360
uh,

03:34.680 --> 03:35.720
is that one of the rings for the finale?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.800
- Uh, yeah.
- No.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.220
- Yeah right.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.060
Okay.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.580
Uh, the network's here and,

03:41.680 --> 03:43.220
Fiona scares me.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.340
So...

03:44.440 --> 03:47.220
(door closes)

03:47.320 --> 03:48.820
- Alright listen, Quinn
might've treated you guys

03:48.920 --> 03:52.860
like children but a 20 share
is grown up people numbers.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.380
- Well I'm glad that we
could deliver for you.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.500
- You're halfway there.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.820
The board is happy about the 20

03:56.920 --> 03:58.700
but no one's really buying the spin off

03:58.800 --> 04:01.820
of the winning couple,
Happily Ever Lasting.

04:01.920 --> 04:02.660
- Really?

04:02.760 --> 04:04.660
I um, I thought that was a done deal.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.500
- Is is, ish.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.620
It's been a balls out season
but there's not exactly

04:08.720 --> 04:11.180
a great romance to root for.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.300
You see my problem?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.820
- Well uh, you know true love in a hurry

04:14.920 --> 04:16.540
on steroids is our specialty.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.380
(Tommy laughs)

04:17.480 --> 04:18.220
- Yeah sure.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.100
We can deliver you a real ass couple with

04:20.200 --> 04:23.260
our eyes closed but what's in it for us?

04:23.360 --> 04:25.020
(Fiona scoffs)

04:25.120 --> 04:26.900
- How 'bout a job next season?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.620
- Not a bad first offer.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.440
- What the hell do you want then?

04:34.280 --> 04:36.100
- A five year deal.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.700
Rachel can show run.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.500
I'll back her up. I don't
care what my title is

04:39.600 --> 04:41.660
as long as we can do it together.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.020
- Wait, so, you guys are a team now?

04:45.120 --> 04:45.820
Like officially?

04:45.920 --> 04:47.780
- No no, this is insane okay?

04:47.880 --> 04:49.980
Rachel's an actual
criminal and I've been here

04:50.080 --> 04:52.020
an aeon longer than butt chump Tommy.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.980
- Okay Jay.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.980
You owe me the love stories.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.260
But, if you can put a cherry on top,

04:58.360 --> 05:02.260
bust our ratings record
and give me a 21 share,

05:02.360 --> 05:03.620
I'll give you a three year deal.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.460
- Oh, god (inhales).

05:05.560 --> 05:06.340
(Tommy sighs)

05:06.440 --> 05:07.340
- That works.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.180
- [Fiona] Alright.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.060
Get on it then.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.020
(door opens)

05:11.120 --> 05:13.380
(gentle music)

05:13.480 --> 05:14.220
(door closes)

05:14.320 --> 05:15.100
- Wait.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.200
Madison wait.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.500
Let me explain. I didn't mean
for any of this to happen

05:19.600 --> 05:20.700
but Rachel and I are--

05:20.800 --> 05:22.540
- I am breaking up with
you Tommy Castelli,

05:22.640 --> 05:24.820
effective immediately.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.920
- Engaged.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.580
Rachel and I are engaged.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.540
(gentle music)

05:30.640 --> 05:31.380
Sorry.

05:31.480 --> 05:34.780
I really shoulda told you first.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.660
- You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.740
You pissed off the Junior Vice President

05:39.840 --> 05:41.580
of Curtain Unscripted at VCN.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.140
Good luck at this
network or anywhere else.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.220
I have a lot of friends in this town.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.580
Lot of friends in a lot of places.

05:48.680 --> 05:51.580
- Hey Fiona, you have a second?

05:51.680 --> 05:53.140
- What's up?

05:53.240 --> 05:54.220
- Bonnie and Clyde in there aren't

05:54.320 --> 05:56.060
the only ones you need to keep sweet.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.140
- Really (laughs)?

05:58.240 --> 06:00.020
Is that some kind of a threat?

06:00.120 --> 06:02.580
- Pick up Passport to
Dance for a second season,

06:02.680 --> 06:03.620
and we're all good.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.420
- And why in the hell would I do that?

06:05.520 --> 06:06.420
- Well because if you don't,

06:06.520 --> 06:09.000
I'm gonna go tell the press that I'm
the producer who filed that complaint,

06:09.080 --> 06:11.540
that I made it directly
to you and you swept

06:11.640 --> 06:14.180
the entire fatted ass thing under the rug.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.800
(tense music)

06:17.720 --> 06:18.820
- This makes me incredibly sad Jay.

06:18.920 --> 06:19.900
- No, no, no, no, no.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.260
You don't get to be sad.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.180
Okay?

06:22.280 --> 06:23.820
This is outrage.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.060
- It makes me sad that
you feel so invisible,

06:27.160 --> 06:29.020
you could have to stoop to

06:29.120 --> 06:30.780
these assholes level to get ahead.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.220
- These assholes are winning,

06:32.320 --> 06:33.540
on your watch.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.980
- These assholes are bringing me ratings.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.220
And I'm pretty sure you started

06:37.320 --> 06:38.940
erasing yourself a long time ago.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.820
(tense music)

06:40.920 --> 06:44.100
If season two of a
failing dance show really

06:44.200 --> 06:46.900
the best you think you can do?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.140
(tense music)

06:50.240 --> 06:52.660
- What else did you have
in mind? (car door opens)

06:52.760 --> 06:54.780
- Find some self respect.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.580
Start thinking bigger.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.980
No one else is gonna do that for you.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.660
(tense music)

07:01.760 --> 07:03.260
(car door slams)

07:03.360 --> 07:05.880
(tense music)

07:11.960 --> 07:13.380
(car door closes)

07:13.480 --> 07:15.960
(tense music)

07:20.560 --> 07:21.620
(car door opens)

07:21.720 --> 07:22.500
- You were right.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.900
(sighs)

07:24.000 --> 07:25.700
I am like so far gone.

07:25.800 --> 07:26.940
I just screwed up big time.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.860
Can, can I come in?

07:28.960 --> 07:30.380
- Really not a good time.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.620
- Can I just say something?

07:31.720 --> 07:33.580
Can I just say that like everything

07:33.680 --> 07:35.060
that I did with Noel and Maya I,

07:35.160 --> 07:37.620
I'm just having a really
hard time living with myself.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.900
(birds chirping)

07:39.000 --> 07:41.900
I mean my hair is falling out.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.260
I'm like,

07:43.360 --> 07:44.500
sick.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.860
And um, I'm really ready to change.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.540
- Really are you sure?

07:49.640 --> 07:50.460
- [Rachel] Yeah.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.820
- Because I mean as far as I can tell

07:51.920 --> 07:53.860
you're the still the
same lost self indulgent

07:53.960 --> 07:55.220
soiled brat you were the day I met you.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.180
- Oh come on Quinn, seriously?

07:56.280 --> 07:57.020
Come on.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.380
- I am serious.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.220
Okay?

07:59.320 --> 08:01.180
It never ends with you.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.140
You love feeling bad.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.640
You roll around in it like a pig in shit.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.660
You wanted that stupid cabin.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.300
I helped you get that cabin.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.900
Then you wanted to put a ring on it

08:13.000 --> 08:16.420
and as ballistically
mental as that was look.

08:16.520 --> 08:17.260
- I am.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.100
- Crazy Rachel got that too, so what now?

08:19.200 --> 08:20.340
You're having cold feet?

08:20.440 --> 08:21.860
- No I'm just trying to make things right.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.780
I mean come on isn't this what you wanted?

08:23.880 --> 08:26.880
- I am so sick and and deeply tired,

08:28.600 --> 08:32.620
of you pretending to be a
better person than you are.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.980
You are a bad person Rachel Goldberg.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.260
And you do bad things.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.180
And so do I.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.940
But at least I admit it.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.660
- Quinn, I am admitting it okay?

08:43.760 --> 08:44.900
That's why I'm here.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.500
- Yeah well it's too late.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.500
(keys jingle)

08:47.600 --> 08:49.620
I finally realised what everybody else

08:49.720 --> 08:52.380
has known about you for a very long time.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.220
- And what's that?

08:53.320 --> 08:55.500
- That you are a bad bet.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.080
I have an actual life to live.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.860
I am out of the Rachel
Goldberg business for good.

09:01.960 --> 09:02.700
- Come on!

09:02.800 --> 09:03.540
What do you want?

09:03.640 --> 09:05.620
You want me on my hands
and knees grovelling?

09:05.720 --> 09:07.060
- It wouldn't hurt because at least

09:07.160 --> 09:08.580
you'd be committing to something.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.420
- Come on Quinn how is this not enough?

09:10.520 --> 09:13.500
- You wanted to be the show runner.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.680
Now you are the stinking show runner.

09:17.520 --> 09:21.320
So why don't you grow
up and go run your show?

09:24.240 --> 09:25.660
(door slams)

09:25.760 --> 09:30.760
(tense music)
(birds chirping)

09:31.400 --> 09:34.120
(dramatic music)

09:35.240 --> 09:37.140
- Quinn!

09:37.240 --> 09:38.980
Please let me in!

09:39.080 --> 09:40.380
Quinn King!

09:40.480 --> 09:41.940
Come back here!

09:42.040 --> 09:44.420
I am not done talking to you!

09:44.520 --> 09:46.860
(dramatic music)

09:46.960 --> 09:48.940
(water falling)

09:49.040 --> 09:50.340
(door opens)

09:50.440 --> 09:51.260
Hey.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.420
- How are we supposed to make

09:52.520 --> 09:54.220
America care about these couples?

09:54.320 --> 09:55.220
I don't care about them.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.020
- Alright.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.300
Forget about the couples,

09:57.400 --> 09:59.520
and forget about romance.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.300
- Um, we sorta promised Fiona--

10:01.400 --> 10:03.020
- No we promised Fiona a 21 share

10:03.120 --> 10:05.940
and we are never gonna
get there with romance.

10:06.040 --> 10:09.420
I mean we have had a kick ass
season of shit shows all year.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.940
Why are we gonna give
up on that right now?

10:12.040 --> 10:12.780
- You okay?

10:12.880 --> 10:13.620
- Yeah I'm great.

10:13.720 --> 10:14.420
(laughs)

10:14.520 --> 10:15.260
I'm great.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.260
I figured it out.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.100
- Yeah?

10:17.200 --> 10:19.200
How do we trump rape?

10:21.920 --> 10:25.700
- Quinn is pregnant with August's baby.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.540
- Wait what?

10:26.640 --> 10:27.340
- [Rachel] Mm hm.

10:27.440 --> 10:28.660
- Are (exhales), are you serious?

10:28.760 --> 10:29.460
- Yep.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.300
The EP getting knocked up by a contestant,

10:31.400 --> 10:34.780
that's expectant mother of
all shit shows right there.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.580
(laughs)

10:36.680 --> 10:38.220
- And,

10:38.320 --> 10:40.320
you'd be willing to,

10:41.240 --> 10:44.660
you know there's no way back
from that for you and Quinn?

10:44.760 --> 10:47.360
(sombre music)

10:50.720 --> 10:53.640
- There is no me and Quinn anymore.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.180
- Tin coffee pots and iron coffee pots.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.660
They are no use to me.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.920
- Okay people we just need to shoot
a brief intro to the last challenge.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.180
- So hurry up and wait please?

11:02.280 --> 11:03.020
(Candy grunts)

11:03.120 --> 11:04.620
- I'm so over this place.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.660
- It should only take a few
minutes. We just need Rachel,

11:06.760 --> 11:08.580
our new show runner to give
us some guidance and to go--

11:08.680 --> 11:10.180
- Why can't I have a proper cup of coffee

11:10.280 --> 11:12.180
from a proper copper coffee pot?

11:12.280 --> 11:13.020
- Graham, Graham?

11:13.120 --> 11:13.860
Graham?
- Yes what?

11:13.960 --> 11:14.900
- Wow, really trying to work here.

11:15.000 --> 11:15.860
- Yeah as am I buddy.

11:15.960 --> 11:16.660
Respect my process.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.560
Well thank you for showing--
- what the hell is going on?

11:17.640 --> 11:19.220
- Thank you for showing up.
- What's going on?

11:19.320 --> 11:21.040
We have a finale to produce.
I mean why is everybody standing

11:21.120 --> 11:23.760
around with their dick in their hands?
- Ugh, wow nice all class.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.900
- Oh I'm sorry do you have
something you wanna say?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.540
- Think I said everything I need to.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.380
- Oh really? So then why don't you get on

11:29.480 --> 11:30.660
your mark you whiny little bitch?

11:30.760 --> 11:32.300
- Whoa Rachel, let's just
take a breather here alright?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.420
- Oh don't tell me what to do.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.580
Why aren't you starting your intro?

11:34.680 --> 11:35.980
Would you like a written invitation?

11:36.080 --> 11:36.980
- No I'm just waitin' for an action.

11:37.080 --> 11:37.820
- Action!

11:37.920 --> 11:38.660
- You!

11:38.760 --> 11:39.500
- Satisfied?

11:39.600 --> 11:40.340
Seriously.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.980
You guys think that you can
put on a finale without me?

11:42.080 --> 11:43.340
Go right ahead.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.060
I don't need this shit!

11:45.160 --> 11:45.980
(phone clattering)

11:46.080 --> 11:46.820
- [All] Whoa!

11:46.920 --> 11:47.620
- Whoa.
- Rachel.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.340
(chattering)

11:49.440 --> 11:51.020
- Okay. Well, uh it's five hours early,

11:51.120 --> 11:53.200
but that's lunch I guess.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.740
- You wanted to know what's
worse than playing golf?

11:56.840 --> 11:58.940
The three fat old white men.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.060
Losing to three fat old white men.

12:02.160 --> 12:05.140
That's it I am handing in my clubs.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.140
I quit.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.820
(sighs)

12:08.920 --> 12:10.540
You okay kiddo?

12:10.640 --> 12:12.820
- Um,

12:12.920 --> 12:16.680
I had my level two
anatomy scan this morning.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.380
- What?

12:18.480 --> 12:19.780
(chuckles)

12:19.880 --> 12:20.820
Why didn't you tell me?

12:20.920 --> 12:23.580
We could've gone in together.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.700
- Mm, you know how I have my weird things

12:25.800 --> 12:27.800
that I like to do alone?

12:28.960 --> 12:31.260
This was just one of them.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.360
- Oh.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.520
- There is something wrong with...

12:43.400 --> 12:45.960
(sombre music)

12:47.000 --> 12:49.380
- Okay well we'll just uh,

12:49.480 --> 12:51.900
we'll take it one step at a time.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.260
- No.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.960
There's something really wrong.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.260
It probably wouldn't make it to term,

12:59.360 --> 13:04.340
but if it does it wouldn't
live long and it would suffer.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.820
It is our decision if we wanna

13:05.920 --> 13:08.480
proceed with the pregnancy but,

13:09.480 --> 13:12.700
I think there's only one
thing we can do, right?

13:12.800 --> 13:15.360
(sombre music)

13:16.560 --> 13:17.340
Right?

13:17.440 --> 13:20.040
(sombre music)

13:26.720 --> 13:28.720
- I'm so sorry.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.380
(phone vibrates)

13:31.480 --> 13:33.180
Don't,

13:33.280 --> 13:35.280
answer that.

13:35.680 --> 13:39.480
Give us a few moments
together to grieve this.

13:41.440 --> 13:44.160
(phone vibrates)

13:45.040 --> 13:45.780
(phone beeps)

13:45.880 --> 13:46.620
- [Quinn] What?

13:46.720 --> 13:47.820
- Rachel's locked herself in the bathroom.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.340
She's refusing to come out.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.260
I tried everything.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.900
I told the grips to remove the door

13:52.000 --> 13:54.300
but when they unscrewed the
hinges she started to scream.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.740
She's having a total meltdown.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.580
- Well if Rachel can't do her job

13:57.680 --> 14:00.300
then maybe this is your
big shot boy scout.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.460
- No, (laughs) I can't call a live finale.

14:02.560 --> 14:03.500
I'm a games guy.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.980
I've never done anything
even close to this.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.860
- [Quinn] Well you know
what how is this my problem?

14:06.960 --> 14:09.780
- Listen Quinn, the contestants
have all turned on Rachel.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.300
After Noels video she's a pregnant pariah.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.660
I'm actually worried
she's gonna hurt herself.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.760
- Hang that up.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.420
- Fine.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.900
Okay just try and ring the piss

14:22.000 --> 14:23.780
out of your pants before I get there.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.500
I'm, I'm, I'm on my way.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.460
(phone beeps)

14:27.560 --> 14:30.660
- So I'm just supposed to stay here?

14:30.760 --> 14:32.900
Deal with this on my own?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.600
(sombre music)

14:37.920 --> 14:38.620
(sniffs)

14:38.720 --> 14:41.320
(sombre music)

14:43.520 --> 14:45.520
- I'm so sorry,

14:47.480 --> 14:49.580
that I let us get carried away.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.460
- Quinny.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.240
(sombre music)

14:54.240 --> 14:55.700
- I have to go to work.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.980
(sombre music)
(footsteps retreating)

15:00.080 --> 15:01.740
(door closes)

15:01.840 --> 15:04.440
(sombre music)

15:05.920 --> 15:07.900
What Rachel Goldberg locked
herself in a bathroom?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.180
That's a new one.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.540
- Well you were off the
rails when you left.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.700
Now the rails are completely gone.

15:12.800 --> 15:13.540
- Ugh.

15:13.640 --> 15:14.380
I'm here.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.220
Step aside.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.660
(footsteps approaching)

15:16.760 --> 15:18.020
(knocking)

15:18.120 --> 15:18.860
Hello!

15:18.960 --> 15:20.460
Are you done in there?

15:20.560 --> 15:22.220
I gotta drop a deuce.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.220
(laughs)

15:23.320 --> 15:24.060
Shut up.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.540
- Yep, sorry.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.100
(door unlocks)

15:27.200 --> 15:27.940
- Alright go.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.260
Get out of here.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.300
(rain falling)

15:31.400 --> 15:32.860
(Quinn clears throat)

15:32.960 --> 15:36.860
(footsteps descending)

15:36.960 --> 15:39.700
I heard you were having a meltdown?

15:39.800 --> 15:41.060
- I wouldn't call (laughs) it that but--

15:41.160 --> 15:42.460
- Well, you can call it whatever you want

15:42.560 --> 15:43.940
just snap out of it.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.820
(rain falling)

15:45.920 --> 15:47.900
I'm here to whip this
crippled crack horse across

15:48.000 --> 15:49.860
the finish line so I am gonna

15:49.960 --> 15:52.900
need your crazy ass off my set.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.260
Yeah, why don't you go see if uh,

15:55.360 --> 15:56.820
set deck needs some help finalising

15:56.920 --> 15:59.700
the location for the live finale.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.860
(rain falling)

16:01.960 --> 16:03.380
- But that's a PA's job.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.020
- Unless the PA is curled up in

16:05.120 --> 16:06.980
a foetal position on the shitter.

16:07.080 --> 16:11.180
(rain falling)
(bird chirping)

16:11.280 --> 16:12.780
- Fine.

16:12.880 --> 16:13.620
- Alright!

16:13.720 --> 16:14.580
Back to work!

16:14.680 --> 16:15.660
Here we go!

16:15.760 --> 16:19.540
Making up for Rachel's
crazy time once again!

16:19.640 --> 16:22.820
(birds chirping)

16:22.920 --> 16:25.060
(gentle music)

16:25.160 --> 16:29.060
- And the Oscar goes to (laughs).

16:29.160 --> 16:30.300
- My meltdown worked.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.140
Got her back here.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.820
We'll have her waiting in the wings.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.260
We'll drop the bomb.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.660
We'll push her out on live TV.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.060
- This is huge for us Rachel.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.020
It'll make our careers.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.380
(gentle music)

16:42.480 --> 16:43.420
- So you didn't really quit?

16:43.520 --> 16:45.900
It was just like more of
a 14 hour lunch break?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.300
- Oh you're being judgy.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.660
That's cute.

16:48.760 --> 16:49.900
- It's perfect timing for me actually

16:50.000 --> 16:51.340
because now I'm quitting.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.180
- What?

16:52.280 --> 16:53.020
(laughs)

16:53.120 --> 16:54.860
You better not be serious.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.180
- As a heart attack Quinn.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.020
(sighs)

16:57.120 --> 16:59.340
- Okay look, I know that
you think you hate it here,

16:59.440 --> 17:00.180
- Mm hm.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.700
- but step away for one
second into the real world

17:02.800 --> 17:04.820
and you will be bored brainless.

17:04.920 --> 17:05.660
- [Jay] No.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.540
- Trust me there is nothing out there.

17:07.640 --> 17:11.380
- Not that's not what this is about Quinn.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.460
- I know that this has been
a disgustingly awful season

17:14.560 --> 17:16.980
but I am back and I think you're gonna

17:17.080 --> 17:19.340
like me a lot more by the end of tonight.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.020
(tense music)

17:21.120 --> 17:22.820
- What are you planning?

17:22.920 --> 17:25.140
- I'm gonna make things right.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.860
So stick with me through
tonight and watch.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.260
And if you still wanna quit at

17:29.360 --> 17:31.060
the end of it then we'll talk.

17:31.160 --> 17:31.900
(door opens)

17:32.000 --> 17:32.820
- Contestants are ready.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.180
(door closes)

17:34.280 --> 17:35.140
You callin' it?

17:35.240 --> 17:35.980
- Yes yes.

17:36.080 --> 17:36.780
Alright here we go.

17:36.880 --> 17:37.620
Let's do this!

17:37.720 --> 17:38.660
- I'm so glad you're back Quinn.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.100
Don't know if you know this or not

17:40.200 --> 17:41.700
but I never think of the audience

17:41.800 --> 17:43.820
when I'm delivering my
(speaking foreign language).

17:43.920 --> 17:45.260
I'm only doin' it for you.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.420
- Aw that touches me.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.340
Right in my bile duct.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.540
(Graham laughs)

17:49.640 --> 17:50.900
- See we have a thing here?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.660
- Yeah, I guess we kinda do.

17:52.760 --> 17:53.740
- [Man] Alright move guys move.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.580
Clear the set.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.420
- Action!

17:55.520 --> 17:59.860
- This is the final
challenge of the season.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.380
And before America votes
for which everlasting couple

18:02.480 --> 18:04.020
will be able to build a life together,

18:04.120 --> 18:05.460
we'd like to see which couple,

18:05.560 --> 18:06.820
(paper rustling)

18:06.920 --> 18:08.540
can build a home together.

18:08.640 --> 18:12.700
America, welcome to Starter Home of Love.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.540
- And cut!

18:13.640 --> 18:14.380
Alright.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.220
It's magic time boys.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.900
Go see if you can fix an entire season

18:18.000 --> 18:21.580
of screw ups in three hours
and make me believe in love.

18:21.680 --> 18:22.420
Alright?

18:22.520 --> 18:23.940
(upbeat music)

18:24.040 --> 18:24.820
- [Man] And action.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.820
- Look I spent every
summer doing construction.

18:26.920 --> 18:27.940
I can handle this.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.420
- Well I spent the last
eight years doing single mom.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.580
I can handle anything (laughs).

18:32.680 --> 18:34.700
(saw whirring)

18:34.800 --> 18:36.820
- What the hell are you doing?

18:36.920 --> 18:38.020
You just sawed our front door in half.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.020
- No, Noel.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.340
Your grandmothers house
had a Dutch door right?

18:42.440 --> 18:43.940
So I make one for you.

18:44.040 --> 18:44.780
- You remembered that?

18:44.880 --> 18:48.020
- Oh, I've been paying more
attention than you think.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.340
- Nicely done smalls pimps.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.420
Giving Rodrigo a vagina.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.860
That's an interesting touch.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.300
And how long before I
can call construction

18:55.400 --> 18:57.740
in here to finish the job
so we can go back inside?

18:57.840 --> 18:59.140
'Cause I'm freezing my ass off!

18:59.240 --> 18:59.980
- Five more minutes.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.300
- I was gonna say one.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.460
- Perfect.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.400
(phone vibrating)

19:11.880 --> 19:12.620
- Hey.

19:12.720 --> 19:13.620
How's it going with Rodrigo?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.180
- He's killin' it.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.940
Ready to win future husband of the year.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.020
(chuckles)

19:18.120 --> 19:19.060
How's the ballroom?

19:19.160 --> 19:21.420
- Oh uh yeah the ballroom's looking great.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.100
Yeah it's uh, you know there's like a lot

19:23.200 --> 19:24.260
of chandeliers to shoot through

19:24.360 --> 19:25.820
and some balconies for camera angles.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.460
I think it's gonna be
perfect for the finale.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.380
(door opens up)
(buzzer buzzes)

19:29.480 --> 19:30.420
Um look I've got to go.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.620
- I love you.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.740
- Uh, I love you too.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.820
(door opens)

19:35.920 --> 19:37.300
(handcuffs clicking)

19:37.400 --> 19:39.020
(buzzer buzzing)

19:39.120 --> 19:41.220
- What the hell are you doin' here Rachel?

19:41.320 --> 19:44.980
- I came to get you out of the cell pit.

19:45.080 --> 19:45.900
You interested?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.480
(tense music)

19:50.400 --> 19:55.400
("Coming Like a Hurricane"
by Death Has No Dominion)

20:36.840 --> 20:37.580
(sighs)

20:37.680 --> 20:42.680
("Coming Like a Hurricane"
by Death Has No Dominion)

20:46.600 --> 20:47.340
- Okay.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.260
Yep.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.900
It's pouring but fine.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.620
It was the great Luther
Vandross who taught us

20:52.720 --> 20:54.260
that a house is not a home

20:54.360 --> 20:56.900
if there's no one there to hold you tight.

20:57.000 --> 20:57.740
- Come on.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.580
Graham.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.060
Stop already.
- Kiss goodnight.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.660
- Now he just ruined
Luther Vandross for me.

21:02.760 --> 21:03.760
- But tonight, each of
our couples will have

21:03.840 --> 21:05.420
a chance to warm there hearth

21:05.520 --> 21:08.540
with their very first home cooked meal.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.500
Will there be a proposal on the menu?

21:11.600 --> 21:12.700
Let's find out.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.700
Okay.

21:13.800 --> 21:14.740
Where's that umbrella?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.300
Just freezing my ass off.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.300
- I have many beautiful
things for my beautiful lady.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.660
Huh?

21:20.760 --> 21:21.980
Pork chops.

21:22.080 --> 21:22.820
Yes?

21:22.920 --> 21:26.360
What your grandmother cooked for us
on our hometown day, remember?

21:27.240 --> 21:28.500
(plates thud)

21:28.600 --> 21:29.700
- Yeah, Rodrigo just stop.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.260
- It's not okay?

21:31.360 --> 21:32.220
Rodrigo makes mistake?

21:32.320 --> 21:34.020
- Just this all feels produced.

21:34.120 --> 21:34.820
- Duh.

21:34.920 --> 21:35.660
(Quinn laughs)

21:35.760 --> 21:36.740
- I know I screwed up this season.

21:36.840 --> 21:39.240
I screwed up long before too.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.620
Look,

21:42.720 --> 21:44.720
I

21:45.080 --> 21:47.080
have a ring,

21:47.680 --> 21:50.340
for the right woman this time.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.940
It's not to marry me (laughs).

21:52.040 --> 21:53.300
If you want to it's perfect.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.340
I mean I say yes right away.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.380
- I'm not asking you to marry me.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.580
- I know, I know.

21:56.680 --> 21:57.820
I know.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.100
And I'm not asking you that either.

22:00.200 --> 22:00.940
Not yet.

22:01.040 --> 22:03.100
- [Quinn] Then what is he asking her?

22:03.200 --> 22:07.380
- All I can ask you
for is a second chance.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.620
Noel,

22:09.720 --> 22:13.300
let me prove you I might
deserve to ask you again.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.020
(gentle music)

22:16.120 --> 22:16.860
Yeah?

22:16.960 --> 22:17.700
- Yeah.

22:17.800 --> 22:18.540
(laughing)

22:18.640 --> 22:20.660
- And there's your Happily
Ever Lasting spin off.

22:20.760 --> 22:21.540
- [Noel] Oh my gosh.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.380
- We spend the whole year
jet setting around the world

22:23.480 --> 22:25.580
with Rodrigo trying to prove his worth.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.100
That is porn for the demo.

22:27.200 --> 22:27.900
- Yeah.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.260
So is the take no
prisoners feminist Barbie

22:29.360 --> 22:30.420
that is Candy Coco.

22:30.520 --> 22:33.700
- And at least August has an
accent that you can understand.

22:33.800 --> 22:34.500
- Right?

22:34.600 --> 22:36.260
- Ugh, I tried your Vegemite.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.380
That stuff is nasty.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.900
- It's an acquired taste.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.140
- That I do not plan to acquire.

22:41.240 --> 22:46.100
So, I cooked up a Miami
favourite (laughs).

22:46.200 --> 22:46.940
- [August] Ah.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.860
- Cuban style and um,

22:48.960 --> 22:52.500
six beers because you know, Australia.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.780
(laughs)

22:53.880 --> 22:54.820
- Thank you.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.740
- Yeah.
- [August] That looks so good.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.980
- But um, if we're gonna do this,

22:59.080 --> 23:03.080
you should know that my
son is everything to me.

23:04.680 --> 23:05.860
- Yeah I do know that.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.300
Candy,

23:07.400 --> 23:09.700
I love that about you.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.800
- No seriously.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.720
Having a kid, it changes you.

23:15.600 --> 23:18.260
The world it just, it means more.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.540
- You okay Quinn?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.460
Didn't peg you for the sentimental type.

23:21.560 --> 23:22.580
- No I'm fine.

23:22.680 --> 23:27.140
I'm just, I feel bad that
people have to watch this crap.

23:27.240 --> 23:27.980
- Uh huh.

23:28.080 --> 23:28.900
- That's the only reason that I'm

23:29.000 --> 23:31.060
going down this road with you August.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.880
I think that you would
be a really great dad.

23:37.760 --> 23:38.900
- Thank you.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.220
- [Jay] Oh we should FaceTime

23:40.320 --> 23:41.820
the kid during the live finale.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.660
- No alright.

23:42.760 --> 23:43.620
It's enough with the kid.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.720
Just leave it alone.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.220
Hey.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.060
(door closes)

23:48.160 --> 23:48.860
How's the location?

23:48.960 --> 23:50.700
You uh calm yourself
down there crazy pants?

23:50.800 --> 23:51.540
- Yeah.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.380
I'm all good.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.180
Thanks.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.060
Um, how's it goin' around here?

23:55.160 --> 23:57.380
- Shockingly well without you Goldberg.

23:57.480 --> 23:58.300
- Alright guys.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.340
Why don't you get out there

23:59.440 --> 24:03.040
and get everyone ready
for the live finale?

24:04.960 --> 24:07.040
(scoffs)

24:08.400 --> 24:09.140
(door slams)

24:09.240 --> 24:10.100
- You ready?

24:10.200 --> 24:11.260
- Yeah.

24:11.360 --> 24:12.700
You got Rodrigo.

24:12.800 --> 24:13.580
I'll prep August.

24:13.680 --> 24:14.660
Let's do this.

24:14.760 --> 24:15.700
(door slams)

24:15.800 --> 24:16.540
Hey.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.180
August. Can I talk to you for a second?

24:18.280 --> 24:19.020
- Definitely not.

24:19.120 --> 24:22.040
I have absolutely nothing to say
to you for the rest of my life.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.020
- Alright well this is different.

24:23.120 --> 24:23.860
- Oh yeah.

24:23.960 --> 24:27.180
- You're gonna want to hear
what I have to say. (sighs)

24:27.280 --> 24:28.220
- You were great out there buddy.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.060
- Oh.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.300
- You and Noel are a lock.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.260
- Mm hm.

24:31.360 --> 24:32.220
- Good thing too.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.460
I'd hate to see a scumbag
like August win this thing.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.460
- August?

24:35.560 --> 24:37.100
What do you mean?

24:37.200 --> 24:37.940
(laughs)

24:38.040 --> 24:39.020
He seems okay.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.140
- Oh I thought so too but,

24:41.240 --> 24:43.500
then I found out he slept with Quinn.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.500
She's pregnant.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.140
With his baby.

24:46.240 --> 24:46.980
- Wait,

24:47.080 --> 24:47.820
Quinn?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.020
- Candy doesn't even know.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.660
I mean you may not be her biggest fan

24:50.760 --> 24:52.580
but still she doesn't deserve this.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.220
She actually likes August.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.540
She wants to introduce him to her kid.

24:55.640 --> 24:56.380
- What?

24:56.480 --> 24:57.660
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.420
- That's why I'm pulling for you and Noel.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.260
What you guys have is real.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.960
(sombre music)

25:05.800 --> 25:06.540
- Ladies.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.380
Hello, how are you?

25:07.480 --> 25:08.180
You look beautiful.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.020
Let's go.

25:09.120 --> 25:09.860
Gentlemen.

25:09.960 --> 25:10.700
Lookin' fantastic.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.540
Let's do this finale,

25:11.640 --> 25:13.380
and all that (laughs).

25:13.480 --> 25:14.420
Million dollars.

25:14.520 --> 25:15.260
Excited?

25:15.360 --> 25:16.900
- [Graham] Hey guys, I'm so excited.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.860
- [Director] I'm so excited guys.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.020
Good luck.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.260
(laughs)

25:21.360 --> 25:23.880
(tense music)

25:25.720 --> 25:26.420
(Jay sighs)

25:26.520 --> 25:28.300
- Someone should burn
this place to the ground.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.880
(tense music)

25:31.720 --> 25:33.500
Good luck tonight Rachel.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.740
- Thanks.

25:34.840 --> 25:36.840
I might need it.

25:38.160 --> 25:38.900
- Guys,

25:39.000 --> 25:39.740
are we doing this?

25:39.840 --> 25:42.300
The vans are leaving.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.920
(tense music)

26:02.400 --> 26:04.960
(gentle music)

26:06.080 --> 26:09.940
- Welcome to Everlasting's All
Stars final four live finale.

26:10.040 --> 26:10.940
I've got to tell you folks,

26:11.040 --> 26:12.980
this is the most exciting finale yet.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.020
Because for the first time,

26:15.120 --> 26:17.540
we are taking away the decision
making from our contestants

26:17.640 --> 26:21.020
and entrusting it to the
wisdom of you America.

26:21.120 --> 26:21.860
Wow.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.380
A million dollars on the line.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.180
And millions of votes cast.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.780
Fan favourite Noel.

26:26.880 --> 26:31.380
And international soccer stud
Rodrigo versus Aussie August

26:31.480 --> 26:33.140
and sassy stripper Candy.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.980
- So, let me guess game boy,

26:35.080 --> 26:36.660
you're gonna tell me that I have

26:36.760 --> 26:38.140
to let America vote and then I have

26:38.240 --> 26:39.980
to do whatever the stupid computer says.

26:40.080 --> 26:40.820
- Oh no.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.420
That computer's not hooked
up to anything (laughs).

26:42.520 --> 26:43.300
- Really?

26:43.400 --> 26:45.820
With a million dollars on the line?

26:45.920 --> 26:48.460
- Well I learned a thing
or two since episode one.

26:48.560 --> 26:49.820
- I'll say.

26:49.920 --> 26:50.660
So don't tell me.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.620
Your girl Noel is gonna go all the way?

26:53.720 --> 26:55.500
- Well (laughs) that was the plan,

26:55.600 --> 26:58.060
but I think we can all agree
that Candy's the real star.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.180
(water sloshes)

26:59.280 --> 27:00.500
- Damn straight.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.740
- We gotta go guys.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.020
Rodrigo, Noel please

27:03.120 --> 27:03.860
- upstairs.
- Okay.

27:03.960 --> 27:04.660
- Thank you very much.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.540
Okay Candy, August we
really need you upstairs.

27:06.640 --> 27:07.420
We're live.
- Okay.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.500

27:26.720 --> 27:27.660

28:13.920 --> 28:15.580

28:40.760 --> 28:41.580
- Thank you America!

28:41.680 --> 28:43.020
I am so rich!

28:43.120 --> 28:43.860
Yes!

28:43.960 --> 28:45.020
- Rodrigo and Noel,

28:45.120 --> 28:46.940
they say that everything has its time.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.540
And now it is time for me to tell you

28:48.640 --> 28:50.860
that your cars are waiting.

28:50.960 --> 28:51.700
(Noel laughs)

28:51.800 --> 28:52.500
August--

28:52.600 --> 28:53.340
- No!

28:53.440 --> 28:54.380
No, no, no, no, no.

28:54.480 --> 28:55.540
August is a cheater.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.300
He's tricking Candy.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.620
And he, he tricks a married girl.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.260
This whole game is rigged.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.940
- [Graham] Rigged? This is
not rigged folks trust me.

29:03.040 --> 29:03.780
Give me the mic.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.180
- August only win because he slept

29:05.280 --> 29:08.380
with the show runner Quinn King.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.700
- [Graham] Okay, alright alright.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.940
- Ah, and now she has his baby!

29:13.040 --> 29:14.300
- Oh please.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.580
No one's gonna believe that.

29:16.680 --> 29:17.620
- So you're telling us,

29:17.720 --> 29:18.860
that our show runner Quinn King,

29:18.960 --> 29:20.420
slept with a contestant,
- Oh for God's sake.

29:20.520 --> 29:21.780
- and is pregnant
- what the hell is this?

29:21.880 --> 29:22.620
- [Graham] with his child?

29:22.720 --> 29:23.420
- I don't know.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.260
But I mean we're live.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.940
You've gotta get down there.
You have to shut it down.

29:26.040 --> 29:26.780
- No.

29:26.880 --> 29:27.620
Not gonna happen.

29:27.720 --> 29:28.620
Just cut to commercial Quinn.

29:28.720 --> 29:29.740
- No I got this Chad.

29:29.840 --> 29:30.540
I got it.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.260
- [Graham] Oh (laughs) hey Rodrigo

29:32.360 --> 29:33.300
come on this is a family show.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.140
- Wow.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.060
Killing mommy.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.900
Guess there was no one else left.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.780
- [Rodrigo] We're live baby!

29:38.880 --> 29:39.940
This is America!

29:40.040 --> 29:41.660
- This is it Rach.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.760
Here comes our 21.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.940
- I speak the truth.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.540
August and Quinn make a baby.

29:48.640 --> 29:49.380
- Hey give me that.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.340
Come on. Folks it's
live TV what can I say?

29:51.440 --> 29:52.660
This must be what it felt like

29:52.760 --> 29:54.060
when you're Walter Cronkite.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.340
You get that phone call to JFK you know?

29:55.440 --> 29:56.180
- [Quinn] Excuse me.

29:56.280 --> 29:56.980
- A head shot or,

29:57.080 --> 29:58.720
we pretended to land on the moon.
- Ah ha.

29:58.800 --> 29:59.540
Excuse me.

29:59.640 --> 30:00.380
- Oh, everybody.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.220
Quinn King.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.060
- Hi.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.660
Uh, good evening everyone.

30:03.760 --> 30:07.260
I am Quinn King the show
runner of Everlasting

30:07.360 --> 30:11.300
and I am sorry Rodrigo
but you have been conned

30:11.400 --> 30:14.560
into telling our audience a total lie.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.300
I mean I have never touched August

30:17.400 --> 30:20.140
and I am certainly not pregnant.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.660
- Camera on August now.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.140
- [Tommy] Here we go.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.760
(tense music)

30:28.400 --> 30:29.340
- Yeah Quinn's tellin' the truth.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.140
We never laid a hand on each other.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.740
- What?

30:32.840 --> 30:34.220
Why is he denying it?

30:34.320 --> 30:35.260
I thought you talked to him.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.220
- I did.

30:36.320 --> 30:37.660
I don't know why he's doing this.

30:37.760 --> 30:40.020
- And sadly I'm afraid Rodrigo

30:40.120 --> 30:41.980
that you were just the latest victim

30:42.080 --> 30:47.080
of a rogue producer who broke
a lot of rules this season.

30:47.640 --> 30:48.940
But now is the time
- No.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.460
- [Quinn] to hold this
producer accountable.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.100
- No no we gotta stop her.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.620
You see what she's doing?

30:54.720 --> 30:55.580
Rachel wake up.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.220
You're the rogue producer.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.300
She's taking you down.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.580
- [Quinn] Now is the time,

30:59.680 --> 31:00.380
- I know.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.140
- to set the record straight.

31:02.240 --> 31:05.980
Maya did not attack Roger because she

31:06.080 --> 31:08.600
is some jealous crazed psycho.

31:09.760 --> 31:12.940
He date raped her on their first season.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.460
And the night she attacked him,

31:15.560 --> 31:19.180
he was trying to do
the same thing to Noel.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.580
(audience gasps)

31:20.680 --> 31:24.020
But, you don't have to
to take my word for it.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.120
You ready?

31:26.720 --> 31:31.240
Can we show the unedited
footage of that night please?

31:32.400 --> 31:33.820
- Oh my God Rachel.

31:33.920 --> 31:34.740
We can't just sit here.

31:34.840 --> 31:36.020
I'm telling Dan to stop it.

31:36.120 --> 31:36.860
- Tommy no.

31:36.960 --> 31:37.700
Just let it play.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.540
- Rachel.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.380
- This is right.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.500
- The truth is our
producer set this all up

31:41.600 --> 31:45.260
and encouraged Maya to confront Roger

31:45.360 --> 31:50.020
knowing that she had PTSD
and might go over the edge.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.380
- Get off of her!

31:51.480 --> 31:53.740
(audience gasps)

31:53.840 --> 31:56.740
(Roger screaming)

31:56.840 --> 31:58.980
(audience whispering)

31:59.080 --> 31:59.820
- [Quinn] Noel.

31:59.920 --> 32:00.740
- Thank you.

32:00.840 --> 32:04.500
Uh Quinn, like many other
victims of sexual assault,

32:04.600 --> 32:06.180
I was ashamed.

32:06.280 --> 32:10.980
And I was persuaded by the
producer to stay quiet.

32:11.080 --> 32:14.380
But Maya is not the villain in this story.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.580
She's the hero.
- We need to get out of here.

32:16.680 --> 32:17.420
Now.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.780
This is the end of your career.

32:18.880 --> 32:19.620
Our worth.

32:19.720 --> 32:20.460
- Good.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.300
I deserve it.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.580
- [Quinn] Maya everyone.

32:22.680 --> 32:26.300
(audience applauding)

32:26.400 --> 32:27.620
- I am proud to say that I've

32:27.720 --> 32:29.980
reported everything to the police.

32:30.080 --> 32:33.180
Roger is being detained
and make no mistake,

32:33.280 --> 32:34.420
they will prosecute.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.260
- [All] Yeah!

32:35.360 --> 32:37.100
(audience applauding)
- We can figure it out.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.020
We can blame Quinn.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.180
- Tommy.

32:40.280 --> 32:41.420
I told her to do it.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.100
(tense music)

32:43.200 --> 32:45.220
(audience applauding)
- What are you talking about?

32:45.320 --> 32:47.420
- You don't want a future with me okay?

32:47.520 --> 32:50.740
I mean you love all of the
terrible things that I've done,

32:50.840 --> 32:52.180
but I don't.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.460
(gasps)

32:53.560 --> 32:56.260
I, I, I can't be this person anymore.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.180
- Rachel, you made those decisions.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.700
I backed you all the way.

32:59.800 --> 33:00.620
We were a great team.

33:00.720 --> 33:01.480
We still are.
- The show is making

33:01.560 --> 33:03.540
me physically ill!

33:03.640 --> 33:04.380
Okay?

33:04.480 --> 33:05.220
I'm a junkie.

33:05.320 --> 33:06.940
I have to cut my arm off.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.140
I mean Quinn's only doing it for me

33:08.240 --> 33:12.080
'cause I don't have the
balls to do it myself.

33:14.840 --> 33:17.780
You wouldn't have loved
the real me anyway.

33:17.880 --> 33:20.480
- You never gave me the chance.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.420
- Thank you Maya and Noel

33:23.520 --> 33:25.940
for sharing your truths but,

33:26.040 --> 33:29.480
now it is time for us to share our truth,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.180
with America.

33:33.280 --> 33:38.120
The name of the rogue producer
who put these women at risk

33:40.680 --> 33:43.540
and tried to publicly shame them

33:43.640 --> 33:46.760
for the sake of money and ratings is,

33:49.640 --> 33:50.780
Tommy Castelli.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.300
(dramatic music)

33:52.400 --> 33:53.140
- What?

33:53.240 --> 33:55.140
(dramatic music)

33:55.240 --> 33:59.980
- [Quinn] We have taken action
and Mr. Castelli will be,

34:00.080 --> 34:00.820
- You set me up?

34:00.920 --> 34:01.620
- No!

34:01.720 --> 34:02.700
- [Quinn] Terminated.

34:02.800 --> 34:03.540
- No no.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.720
That's not the way it was supposed to go!
It was supposed to be not you.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.860
- I was the one person you
weren't supposed to lie to.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.540
- It wasn't about you,
it was supposed to be.

34:12.640 --> 34:13.380
- Oh my God.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.020
- [Quinn] There will be consequences.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.260
- You really are a monster.

34:16.360 --> 34:19.580
(dramatic music)

34:19.680 --> 34:23.100
- What and incredible end
to an incredible journey.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.340
You know this is the first time

34:24.440 --> 34:26.220
in the stored history of Everlasting,

34:26.320 --> 34:28.740
not only do we have two winners,

34:28.840 --> 34:29.620
we have four.

34:29.720 --> 34:32.980
Maya and Noel have won back their dignity

won a million dollars,

34:41.560 --> 34:43.560
and a job on TV.

34:44.360 --> 34:46.740

I'm gonna put that on my Emmy reel.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.300
- How could you do that?

35:02.400 --> 35:04.020
That wasn't our plan.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.100
You were supposed to make things right.

35:06.200 --> 35:06.940
- And I did.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.940
- You were supposed to
put the gun to my head.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.140
(chattering)

35:12.240 --> 35:13.820

with any of that okay?

This was classic Quinn saving Rachel

36:08.640 --> 36:11.220
in the least surprising
move of the season.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.260

I'm not sure how much value I'd be.

push your ass outside the door with

36:32.200 --> 36:34.520

Let me run it for you.

'Cause girl like you said,

36:38.200 --> 36:40.540
I can do so much better
than this low brow crap

36:40.640 --> 36:42.640
and so can you.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.140
- Fiona?

36:44.240 --> 36:44.980
Fiona?

36:45.080 --> 36:47.540
I just, I wanted you to know
how much working for you

36:47.640 --> 36:50.420
has meant to me and with
everything in flux here,

36:50.520 --> 36:52.540
if I happen to find myself available

36:52.640 --> 36:54.780
in the near future I would love

36:54.880 --> 36:57.860
to go with you wherever you might go.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.960
- Hm.

37:00.920 --> 37:02.920
What do you think Jay?

37:05.760 --> 37:08.060

I mean you know I always said that

37:16.720 --> 37:17.740
you should be running this place.

I think we should go get a drink sometime.
