Driver's license and government I.D.

02:26.070 --> 02:28.470
- What's the nature of your visit?
- Pleasure.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.670
- You transporting any firearms?
- No,sir.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.450
- Fresh produce? Livestock?
- Nope.

02:33.730 --> 02:37.250
- Has anyone given you anything to bring across the border.
- No,sir.

02:37.260 --> 02:39.580
Welcome to Canada.

02:52.530 --> 02:54.760
Sir,you have to move your car.

02:54.770 --> 02:57.300
Sir,you have to go.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.220
Sir,you can't stop here. Go,keep moving!

03:04.700 --> 03:07.130
Stop the car now!

03:08.970 --> 03:12.590
Stop the car or we'll shoot!

03:20.570 --> 03:23.340
- Get out of the car!
- Get out of the vehicle!

03:23.350 --> 03:26.270
- Put your hands out in front of you.
- Let's see your hands!

03:26.280 --> 03:28.780
- Palms toward me!
- Get out of the car!

03:29.490 --> 03:32.240
- Get out of the car!
- Get out of the car!

03:33.000 --> 03:34.840
Keep your hands in the air!

03:37.020 --> 03:39.050
Keep 'em up!

03:39.870 --> 03:42.390
Move to the left. Keep your
hands high where I can see them.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.660
All right,stop. Stop. Put
your hands on your head.

03:47.420 --> 03:50.060
Get down on your knees.

03:52.840 --> 03:57.320
Slowly put your hands down on the
pavement and lie on your stomach.

03:58.790 --> 04:01.190
Don't move!

04:01.730 --> 04:04.190
You're gonna want to call the FBI.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.270
I've killed 10 people in the last month.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.550
- What are you talking about?
- Look in the car.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.970
Get him up. Get him
up. Get him on his feet.

04:37.830 --> 04:40.400
Are you telling me you
killed all these people?

04:44.040 --> 04:46.310
Make the call.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.230
His name's William Hightower.

04:53.260 --> 04:57.030
He claims over the past month,he's picked
10 people off the streets of Detroit,

04:57.040 --> 04:59.960
killed them,dumped their bodies
across the border in Canada.

04:59.980 --> 05:01.300
Has he given up the dumpsite?

05:01.320 --> 05:02.880
He said he'll only talk to the FBI.

05:02.910 --> 05:04.810
Do we have confirmation
these people are even missing?

05:04.830 --> 05:08.580
Two were reported missing by family months
ago,but they all appear to be transients.

05:08.610 --> 05:10.960
We're having a hard time
finding any information on them.

05:10.970 --> 05:13.520
- Garcia?
- Like a bloodhound,sir.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.370
So what do we know about this guy?

05:15.410 --> 05:17.670
Until 2 months ago,he was
a sergeant in the U.S. Army.

05:17.690 --> 05:21.400
He did 2 tours in iraq. Lost his
left leg in a roadside ambush.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.450
He was discharged with a purple
heart and a commendation for valor.

05:24.460 --> 05:27.200
And the royal Canadian mounted
police are requesting our help?

05:27.230 --> 05:28.540
They don't have a lot of choice.

05:28.570 --> 05:32.040
He manages to get away with 10
murders,why crash the guard post?

05:32.070 --> 05:33.690
Could be an attempted suicide.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.310
And maybe he was trying to take as
many people with him as he could.

05:36.330 --> 05:39.420
It may also be a case of
post-traumatic stress disorder.

05:39.430 --> 05:41.760
- I don't know.
- Do we think he's legit?

05:41.770 --> 05:44.170
I think it's too many
bodies to take chances.

06:21.140 --> 06:22.690
Flannery O'Connor said,

06:22.970 --> 06:28.330
"If there were no hell,we would be
like the animals. No hell, no dignity."

06:28.340 --> 06:30.590
He documented them all in detail.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.200
Names,photos,dates,and
locations where he took them.

06:34.230 --> 06:36.130
Military background. He's
bound to be organized.

06:36.140 --> 06:37.630
He definitely doesn't have a type.

06:37.650 --> 06:40.690
The only consistency is that they
were all abducted in the same area.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.810
- Yeah,what do we know about that?
- It's called the Cass corridor. It's right here.

06:43.820 --> 06:48.910
It has an extremely high concentration of drug
trafficking,prostitution,and homeless people.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.250
All high-risk behavior.

06:50.270 --> 06:53.380
So,for this guy,maybe it's more
about opportunity than victimology.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.890
Morgan and Prentiss,when we land,I
want you to head straight to Detroit.

06:55.910 --> 06:57.520
See if you hear anything
in the whisper stream.

06:57.550 --> 07:00.170
I want to make sure we have a crime
before we get too deeply into this.

07:00.190 --> 07:02.960
I hear Detroit is beautiful in the spring.

07:04.270 --> 07:07.820
The rest of us will meet with the legal attache
before whit the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

07:07.860 --> 07:11.820
Actually,sir,the officer in charge said that
his team was part of a fellowship the B.A.U. gave

07:11.830 --> 07:14.660
to train police forces in profiling.

07:15.070 --> 07:17.840
That was the first one we ever did.

07:18.310 --> 07:19.320
Jeff Bedwell.

07:19.350 --> 07:20.740
- You know him?
- Yeah.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.840
- Is he any good?
- He better be. I trained him.

07:23.850 --> 07:26.690
<i>******</i>

07:26.700 --> 07:28.790
- Dave.
- Jeff,how you been?

07:28.800 --> 07:32.530
You mean besides having serial killers
trying to take out our border agents?

07:32.550 --> 07:36.910
Jeff Bedwell, Agents Aaron Hotchner,
Spencer Reid, Jennifer Jareau.

07:36.930 --> 07:38.150
Thanks for being here.

07:38.170 --> 07:42.540
I've got a victim board and timelines
set up on monitors in the conference room.

07:42.570 --> 07:44.720
Anything you need,you've
got the run of the place.

07:44.750 --> 07:47.200
- We appreciate it.
- Don't thank me. Thank the unsub.

07:47.210 --> 07:49.350
He's the one that put you all in charge.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.460
I see you paid attention in class.

07:51.480 --> 07:54.730
I need to go talk to Garcia,see if she
had any luck locating the family members.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.610
And check records for
multiple border crosses,

07:56.640 --> 07:59.270
- see if we get any hits for the days the victims went missing.
- Got it.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.240
You believe that he
killed all these people?

08:01.270 --> 08:03.590
- Fits the profile.
- How so?

08:04.490 --> 08:09.230
He got a recent physical trauma. Could
be a stressor. Wide disparity of victims.

08:09.240 --> 08:13.060
No bodies. Possible border cross.
Two entirely different terrains.

08:13.070 --> 08:18.510
To pull that off,you'd have to be smart,you'd
have to be organized,mobile,physical.

08:18.530 --> 08:21.120
- Military background gives you all that.
- Exactly.

08:21.130 --> 08:27.160
It appears as though he clusters his victims
into men,then women,and then back to men again.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.060
What does that tell you?

08:29.070 --> 08:30.310
At the moment,nothing.

08:30.340 --> 08:32.380
Has he contacted family?

08:32.400 --> 08:33.860
Refuses a lawyer,too.

08:33.890 --> 08:36.710
- He's in interrogation?
- Waiting for us.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.470
This guy's U.S. Army. He
demanded to talk to the FBI.

08:43.480 --> 08:48.080
He's not gonna want to talk to anyone
but the person he thinks is in charge.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.670
Of course. I'll take you to him.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.920
Has he been agitated?

09:00.350 --> 09:02.860
Hasn't flinched.

09:03.330 --> 09:04.920
He knows we're here?

09:04.930 --> 09:07.090
- We told him.
- Good.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.980
You're not gonna interrogate him?

09:11.990 --> 09:14.330
If I go in now,he's in charge.

09:14.340 --> 09:18.670
If I wait and gather
information... It's mind interview.

09:20.730 --> 09:23.070
So you let him sweat.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.920
Let's see what we turn up in Detroit.

09:29.470 --> 09:32.430
I don't think the bailout's
gonna cover all of this.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.510
- Anything seem strange to you?
- Yeah,they've set up camps.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.510
I don't see a single person who's
isolated themselves from the others.

09:38.540 --> 09:40.940
People on the street don't usually
care about safety in numbers.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.570
Unless something scared them
into changing their behavior.

09:43.580 --> 09:45.750
Look at this. Drug deals
are out in the open.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.880
Prostitutes seem to be working in groups.
I mean,if this guy did kill 10 people,

09:48.890 --> 09:51.370
I don't see how he could have
done it without witnesses.

09:52.470 --> 09:54.690
So,how do you want to work this?

09:54.700 --> 09:58.460
I think we start with the most recent victim
first,see if we even have a crime here.

09:58.930 --> 10:01.870
Why don't you start with the junkies
and I'll take the working girls.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.770
Keep dreaming.

10:03.780 --> 10:06.620
Ladies,you seen these two
guys? Anybody look like that?

10:09.830 --> 10:12.840
What's up,my man? You seen
a brother look like that?

10:14.180 --> 10:15.940
No?

10:18.690 --> 10:21.450
My man,you mind if I
ask you a few questions?

10:21.460 --> 10:23.470
Depends what you're asking.

10:30.970 --> 10:33.480
- You know him?
- That's charles.

10:33.490 --> 10:34.860
Don't know his last name.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.430
You ever see him get into
any kind of beef with anyone?

10:37.440 --> 10:39.720
Charles was a junkie.

10:39.730 --> 10:41.680
Junkies want peace.

10:41.690 --> 10:44.060
You just said he was a
junkie. You know something I don't?

10:44.420 --> 10:48.590
Just that he's gone. 2 days now.

10:49.510 --> 10:52.940
Is that weird,for him to
disappear for 2 days like that?

10:52.960 --> 10:55.760
A lot of people have been
disappearing these days.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.960
And when they do,they don't come back.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.290
That's gotta happen out
here all the time,no?

11:00.460 --> 11:02.780
Not like this,man.

11:02.790 --> 11:05.530
One day a girl's on the
street,the next she's gone.

11:05.560 --> 11:09.140
We've been trying to stick together,but
once a john rolls up,you're on your own.

11:09.550 --> 11:12.230
What makes you think these
people aren't just leaving?

11:12.240 --> 11:16.250
It's not that easy to get
away from this life. Trust me.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.270
Do you recognize this man?

11:19.280 --> 11:20.610
He's out here all the time.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.370
Has anyone ever tried
to hassle with him?

11:22.400 --> 11:25.630
Brother's got a gun.
No one messes with him.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.020
But he messes with all of you,right?

11:28.030 --> 11:29.720
Not exactly.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.890
I need to know everything
this brother does.

11:31.910 --> 11:35.010
How he talks,how he moves.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.350
Every bit of his behavior.
Can you do that for me?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.890
Yeah,ok. Got it.

11:42.770 --> 11:45.040
- Morgan?
- We're ready.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.520
I'm Aaron Hotchner. I'm the Behavioral
Analysis Unit chief from the FBI.

11:56.530 --> 11:58.150
You're here to analyze me.

11:58.180 --> 12:01.400
No,I'm here to take your confession and
find out where you dumped your victims.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.090
Or are you wasting my time?

12:03.110 --> 12:05.510
I gave you names. I gave you dates.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.960
You didn't give me a dump site.

12:10.930 --> 12:15.350
You were a sergeant. You
led troops,probably lost men.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.520
A few.

12:16.550 --> 12:20.060
How would their parents feel if the didn't
know whether their sons were dead or alive?

12:20.080 --> 12:23.460
Don't lecture me on notifying families.

12:23.490 --> 12:25.240
I've been on those doorsteps.

12:25.280 --> 12:28.840
No one cares about those
people. Why should I?

12:28.850 --> 12:30.900
Here we go.

12:31.580 --> 12:35.850
- What do you mean?
- An interrogation doesn't really start until you get the first lie.

12:35.860 --> 12:38.620
See,that's just the thing,William.
We talked to the people on the street.

12:38.630 --> 12:40.670
You were out there every night.
You took their photographs.

12:40.680 --> 12:43.140
You checked off their
names in a notebook.

12:43.910 --> 12:44.690
So?

12:44.720 --> 12:48.770
Your behavior was more like a protector,like
someone in the army doing a bed check.

12:48.780 --> 12:52.150
You've gone to a lot of trouble to
confess to a crime you didn't commit.

12:52.160 --> 12:57.200
The folks on the street-- did
they tell you people were missing?

12:57.240 --> 13:00.410
If my team is here,then there
are cases we are not working on.

13:00.420 --> 13:03.540
- You are wasting our time.
- 10 people dead,huh?

13:03.990 --> 13:05.300
It's not enough for you.

13:05.330 --> 13:08.010
I've watched the tape of you at the
border cross over and over again.

13:08.040 --> 13:11.110
You wait until every guard is out of
the booth before you drive into it.

13:11.130 --> 13:13.150
If you wanted to kill
people,you had your chance.

13:13.170 --> 13:16.360
Are you investigating
these murders or not?

13:17.590 --> 13:20.410
So that's what this is all about?

13:20.730 --> 13:23.110
Making sure we investigate?

13:23.130 --> 13:27.000
If you thought people were being killed,you
should have gone to the police in Detroit.

13:27.710 --> 13:30.070
I did.

13:30.870 --> 13:32.460
3 times.

13:32.490 --> 13:36.190
They told me the kind of people
I was looking for disappeared.

13:36.210 --> 13:39.700
They said that's the way
life on the street works.

13:41.350 --> 13:45.400
Do you believe the people
I showed you are missing?

13:46.020 --> 13:47.090
I believe it's possible.

13:47.110 --> 13:50.140
Don't give me a political answer.

13:54.570 --> 13:57.610
Tell me what happened the
night before the border cross.

13:58.770 --> 14:00.980
I did a head count.

14:02.250 --> 14:05.280
Every night for the last
month like we do in baghdad.

14:06.540 --> 14:12.350
That night I saw a boy named charles wasn't where
he usually camped down,so I made another pass.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.710
He didn't turn up?

14:13.740 --> 14:16.680
By the morning,I knew he was gone.

14:16.980 --> 14:20.840
William... People don't do
what you did out of honor.

14:20.850 --> 14:23.220
They do it out of love.

14:24.660 --> 14:28.020
Who were you looking for
on the streets every night?

14:29.350 --> 14:31.440
I got home from iraq.

14:31.450 --> 14:36.400
First thing my mother told me was that
my baby sister Lee was on the streets.

14:39.220 --> 14:41.390
She asked me to find her.

14:41.420 --> 14:42.680
But you couldn't?

14:42.710 --> 14:46.620
I managed once. Brought her home.

14:47.210 --> 14:49.720
We got her fed.

14:53.300 --> 14:57.160
She even wore my dog
tags... For good luck.

14:57.650 --> 15:02.060
Two weeks later,she slipped
back onto the streets.

15:04.020 --> 15:06.270
That was it.

15:07.700 --> 15:12.810
William,you've got so much information about
the other potential victims. Why not Lee?

15:13.790 --> 15:17.400
I hide it in a spare tire...

15:17.730 --> 15:20.710
In my car.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.380
I needed to wait until I was sure...

15:30.320 --> 15:33.290
That you were on board.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.120
William,are you there?

15:36.150 --> 15:38.350
Something bad is happening. It's dark.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.570
I don't know where he's taking me.

15:40.590 --> 15:41.800
After that,the signal cuts out.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.540
This is the same night
she left her mom's house?

15:43.560 --> 15:45.080
Hightower called in an army favor.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.970
They triangulated the call to a cell tower
in Canada just over the border in Port Huron.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.020
It explains why he crossed
into your jurisdiction.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.440
It's also a surefire way
to get the FBI involved.

15:53.460 --> 15:56.820
He knew we'd investigate an American citizen
being held on multiple murder charges.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.950
- And you believe him?
- I do.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.700
- Go ahead,Garcia.
- Good news and bad news.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.540
I've got I.D. s on multiple border
crosses for the dates in question.

16:04.550 --> 16:06.880
Trouble is,I've got hundreds,and
as far as I can tell,

16:06.900 --> 16:09.340
if your license doesn't
ping for any prior felonies,

16:09.360 --> 16:12.220
you're pretty much gonna pass go
and collect 200 Canadian dollars.

16:12.230 --> 16:15.210
She's right. Busiest
cross in north America.

16:15.220 --> 16:17.590
Lot of commercial traffic,trucks mostly.

16:17.630 --> 16:19.770
Stop and searches would
cause too many delays.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.540
So he's got virtually free passage.

16:21.560 --> 16:25.190
And once he crosses,there's nothing
but woods to hide whatever he's doing.

16:28.140 --> 16:30.010
<i>Canada, Ontario</i>

19:48.890 --> 19:52.460
I don't understand why we
need to talk in private.

19:55.370 --> 19:58.410
We want you to release William
Hightower into our custody.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.190
I can't do that.

19:59.220 --> 20:01.320
He's documented a potential
victim pool in Detroit.

20:01.350 --> 20:02.830
He's our best eyes on the street.

20:02.850 --> 20:05.140
He tried to murder 5 border agents.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.870
You can't personalize this,Jeff.

20:06.890 --> 20:11.030
Isn't that what you're doing to me,trading on
our relationship to get me to release a prisoner?

20:11.490 --> 20:13.530
I respect what you've
taught me,but when you leave,

20:13.560 --> 20:15.380
I still have to be able
to look my men in the eye.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.650
Then do whatever you
can to catch the unsub.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.410
It's not that simple.

20:19.430 --> 20:21.140
You getting pressure from above?

20:21.160 --> 20:23.920
They're not gonna let me turn
William Hightower into a hero.

20:23.950 --> 20:27.070
This unsub kills in
2- and 3-day cycles.

20:27.080 --> 20:30.430
Which means he's about to
go back out there,hunting.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.090
Release him into FBI custody
while he's in Detroit.

20:33.120 --> 20:36.300
When the case is closed,he'll
be back under your jurisdiction.

20:36.850 --> 20:39.320
Your shop,your call.

20:40.490 --> 20:44.340
Well... They can fire me if they want.

20:56.670 --> 20:59.670
Hey,uh,they say you get used to it.

21:02.070 --> 21:05.230
Right now,it just hurts like hell.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.380
We'd like you with us
in the Cass corridor.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.380
- Doing what?
- The same thing you've been doing.

21:18.390 --> 21:21.710
We'll conduct nightly checks.
You have a rapport out there.

21:21.720 --> 21:25.460
If something is happening,we'll react
more quickly and we'll have more manpower.

21:25.850 --> 21:28.600
Is the Detroit police
department on board?

21:28.610 --> 21:31.180
We're talking to them now about it.

21:42.930 --> 21:45.920
William Hightower. Yeah,I remember him.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.740
He was sincere. I felt for him.

21:47.750 --> 21:49.110
But you didn't look into it.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.650
Families don't want to see what we do.

21:50.670 --> 21:54.740
They'd rather believe someone is dead than admit
she's off turning tricks in Chicago or Toronto.

21:54.770 --> 21:56.680
We believe William
Hightower might be right.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.500
You might have a serial killer.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.010
We'd like you to open up your records.

22:00.020 --> 22:02.860
Let our analysts take a look at
reports from the past few months

22:02.890 --> 22:07.360
and see if there's been a change in the crime pattern
disturbances or assaults that may be connected.

22:07.390 --> 22:08.170
I can do that.

22:08.190 --> 22:12.360
We'd also like to give your colleagues the working
profile once we have it to see if anything sparks.

22:12.810 --> 22:17.350
Fair enough. So,how did he
convince the FBI to look into this?

22:17.800 --> 22:20.810
He drove his car into the guard
post at the Port Huron border

22:20.830 --> 22:23.690
and then confessed to
murdering 10 people.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.680
- Seriously?
- Yes.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.620
How many victims did he say?

22:28.650 --> 22:31.090
Potentially 11,including his sister.

22:34.460 --> 22:36.460
Yes,ma'am,right now we
just consider them missing.

22:36.490 --> 22:40.530
The second I get more information,I'll
be in contact with you. Ok.

22:41.170 --> 22:42.850
How's it going?

22:42.860 --> 22:45.540
The majority of the people on the
street aren't even from Detroit.

22:45.550 --> 22:48.400
We don't have last names on
most of them. No hometowns.

22:48.410 --> 22:52.050
Unless there's a missing persons report
on file somewhere,it's almost impossible.

22:52.070 --> 22:55.160
Most of these people's families
probably gave up on seeing them long ago.

22:55.180 --> 22:57.270
A mother would never give up.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.660
Can you hand me William
Hightower's arrest report?

23:10.090 --> 23:12.290
- Yeah, Garcia.
- Sherlock, it's Watson.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.120
- I think I've got something.
- What do you have?

23:14.130 --> 23:17.090
I checked Detroit crime
reports over the last month

23:17.120 --> 23:21.180
because Derek and Emily astutely thought there
might be some sorts of assaults or disturbances

23:21.210 --> 23:23.010
- having to do with our unsub.
- And?

23:23.020 --> 23:25.840
Well,it's tres weird,but on
5 of the abduction nights,

23:25.850 --> 23:31.120
Detroit P.D. reports a break-in or a
robbery at some type of medical facility.

23:31.150 --> 23:32.830
What types of medical facility?

23:32.870 --> 23:36.680
We got a hospital,blood bank,medical
supply company,the red cross--

23:36.710 --> 23:38.150
what is he doing,stealing narcotics?

23:38.160 --> 23:40.130
That's just it. He isn't
some drugstore cowboy.

23:40.140 --> 23:46.030
The stuff he took is,like,anesthesia
and sterilizing equipment and syringes.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.450
Negative on the narcota.

23:47.470 --> 23:49.300
Garcia,where were these places located?

23:49.320 --> 23:53.090
Putnam Street, St. Antoine, east
Hancock, Martin Luther King Boulevard.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.400
Those are all in the Cass corridor.

23:54.420 --> 23:56.250
Do you have a list
of what else he stole?

23:56.270 --> 23:59.600
Uh,i.v.tubing,infusion
pump,units of o-negative blood,

23:59.610 --> 24:03.150
chest tubes,o-silk sutures,elastoplast.

24:03.170 --> 24:04.930
Garcia,thanks a lot.

24:04.970 --> 24:08.010
You don't just randomly know how
to took a line up to an infusion pump.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.990
Or that o-neg is the only
safe blood type for any victim.

24:11.020 --> 24:13.570
I'll tell Hotch we think we
know what he's doing with them.

24:16.250 --> 24:19.340
We believe the man we're
looking for is a sexual sadist.

24:19.370 --> 24:23.800
What this means is that for him,the torture
becomes a substitute for the sex act.

24:23.810 --> 24:27.700
The fact that he's stealing medical equipment
like sterilizing agents and anesthesia

24:27.720 --> 24:31.030
tells us he may be performing
experiments or surgeries on his victims.

24:31.060 --> 24:33.730
We believe this unsub gets
gratification from his ability

24:33.760 --> 24:36.890
to keep his victims alive in
order to endure more torture.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.830
The choice of items stolen
is extremely specific,

24:39.860 --> 24:42.120
which makes us believe he's
got a medical background.

24:42.160 --> 24:46.170
Check disciplinary files at hospitals,med
schools,and community health organizations.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.960
People would have noticed his behavior.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.290
This is someone who would volunteer
to perform painful procedures.

24:51.330 --> 24:56.460
And he would spend extra time probing,say,a
broken hand or a distended abdomen.

24:56.480 --> 24:59.720
And after a long day,when everyone else is
emotionally drained from multiple traumas

24:59.730 --> 25:01.010
and mangled bodies,

25:01.040 --> 25:04.500
he'd be the one pushing his coworkers to
go out for a drink and talk about their day.

25:04.520 --> 25:05.580
Now,we know what
you're thinking--

25:05.620 --> 25:10.760
a profile is fine,but,yes,our best shot at
stopping this guy is still to catch him in the act.

25:10.790 --> 25:14.010
This unsub is extremely
smart and obviously organized.

25:14.040 --> 25:17.250
He's managed to abduct very different
victims with very different abilities,

25:17.260 --> 25:19.190
all with no witnesses.

25:19.200 --> 25:22.610
Now,we're coordinating with the police
and our agents on the ground in Detroit.

25:22.620 --> 25:27.030
We've also asked sergeant Hightower to
act as a guide on the streets in Detroit

25:27.040 --> 25:29.470
- while he's in our custody.
- That's it.

25:29.480 --> 25:32.530
Any questions,you find
me or one of the agents.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.680
What's she doing here?

25:40.710 --> 25:43.330
Well,we've notified all the
family members we can locate.

25:43.340 --> 25:44.920
You have no right.

25:44.940 --> 25:47.370
- It's her daughter.
- No,it's one thing to...

25:47.850 --> 25:50.380
To believe Lee is lost on the streets.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.630
I don't want her to know that
there's a killer out there.

25:53.640 --> 25:56.130
- We know how this is gonna end.
- No,we don't.

25:56.140 --> 26:00.430
Look,everything I have done is to
find the truth so I can spare her.

26:00.750 --> 26:02.800
I don't want her living off hope.

26:02.830 --> 26:05.740
- There are worse things.
- You're wrong.

26:06.350 --> 26:10.030
Bad news stops us for a
while,but then you move on.

26:10.610 --> 26:13.830
Hope is paralyzing.

26:19.770 --> 26:22.290
You did a stupid thing.

26:24.390 --> 26:28.160
- Yes,ma'am.
- Come here.

26:37.590 --> 26:40.200
All these people are missing?

26:40.670 --> 26:43.920
- We believe so.
- You have any suspects?

26:43.930 --> 26:47.350
No. But we have a strategy
to try to catch him.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.670
And William is helping.

26:52.120 --> 26:56.930
My daughter-- there's a chance
she-- she might still be alive?

26:56.940 --> 26:58.710
It's possible.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.510
Do you know what he's doing to them?

27:02.530 --> 27:05.150
It's difficult to say.

27:37.730 --> 27:40.930
<i>Detroit Police Department
13Th Precinct</i>

27:45.190 --> 27:47.060
Thanks for believing me.

27:47.070 --> 27:49.990
William,I want you to understand
that even if we catch him,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.670
You're probably gonna end
up doing some time in Canada.

27:52.690 --> 27:54.920
I can live with that.

27:58.380 --> 28:01.210
- Detective Tay Benning,this is SSA Aaron Hotchner.
- How do you do?

28:01.220 --> 28:03.080
This is William Hightower. He's
gonna help us on the ground.

28:03.090 --> 28:05.820
These are Agents Prentiss
and Morgan,Detective Benning.

28:06.530 --> 28:08.400
We've met.

28:08.410 --> 28:11.870
I'm sorry I didn't look into
your sister's disappearance.

28:12.610 --> 28:15.070
We should split up and cover
male and female potential victims.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.400
- Ok.
- We'll take the men.

28:16.410 --> 28:18.280
I'll make the introductions for you.

28:18.290 --> 28:20.750
Stay close to your phones.
If anyone's out of place,

28:20.760 --> 28:24.560
Detective Benning can get a name and a description
to our patrol cars as quickly as possible.

28:51.060 --> 28:53.290
You really believe he's
about to abduct someone again?

28:53.300 --> 28:54.940
It's coming soon--
tonight,tomorrow.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.760
We know he sticks to a tight cycle.

28:56.770 --> 29:00.970
The question is,why alternate
victims in clusters of men and women?

29:00.990 --> 29:02.730
Why take the men at all?

29:02.850 --> 29:03.830
What do you mean?

29:03.860 --> 29:05.810
We said he sees these
people as disposable.

29:05.820 --> 29:07.380
It doesn't matter if
they're male or female.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.410
For a sexual sadist,male
or female isn't important.

29:10.430 --> 29:11.960
The torture itself is the sex.

29:11.990 --> 29:14.930
But wouldn't it be much easier
to approach a prostitute?

29:14.950 --> 29:17.070
She's right. A prostitute will
get into a car with an unsub.

29:17.080 --> 29:19.800
It's a victim he can isolate
easily with no witnesses.

29:19.830 --> 29:21.420
Is Hightower's mother still here?

29:21.440 --> 29:22.960
She's resting in my office.

29:22.980 --> 29:25.120
Jj,see if she's willing to talk to us.

29:25.140 --> 29:27.140
I want to know everything
I can about her daughter.

29:27.180 --> 29:30.220
In the meantime,we need to figure out how
he's separating his male victims from the pack.

29:30.250 --> 29:32.990
And hope that Hightower gives
us an edge on the street.

29:33.590 --> 29:36.720
This group gonna stay
close to Cass Avenue.

29:36.740 --> 29:39.480
They're usually on the
corners. They don't stray.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.070
It's like I said the
first time I was out here--

29:43.080 --> 29:44.930
It is not easy for
someone to be isolated.

29:44.970 --> 29:46.470
Everything is out in the open.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.850
Ok. That's Walter Patterson.

29:48.860 --> 29:51.070
He helped show me the lay of the land.

29:54.070 --> 29:56.190
Yo, Walter!

30:03.730 --> 30:07.500
This is Detective Benning and
Agent Morgan. They need your smarts.

30:07.510 --> 30:09.350
You know he lost his baby sister,right?

30:09.370 --> 30:10.820
Yes,we do.

30:10.830 --> 30:12.850
Spread the word.

30:12.890 --> 30:14.730
They're not here to hassle anyone.

30:15.410 --> 30:17.660
Be safe.

30:20.290 --> 30:22.740
So... What do you want to know?

30:23.240 --> 30:25.840
What would make you separate
from everyone else out here?

30:25.870 --> 30:27.590
There's nothin'.

30:27.620 --> 30:31.160
There's gotta be something. You
go to the bathroom? Grab some food?

30:31.170 --> 30:32.540
Drugs? Women?

30:32.550 --> 30:34.450
Everybody's extra careful right now.

30:34.470 --> 30:37.070
People gotta have secrets,even
on the street,walter.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.870
The only thing I keep
secret out here is money.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.230
Hey,we have 3 unaccounted for.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.230
These are their photos?

31:08.760 --> 31:11.360
Did you see any of these
girls leave with customers?

31:11.940 --> 31:15.140
I saw Monica and Sasha.
I don't know about Kelly.

31:15.150 --> 31:17.200
Do you know where they would go?

31:17.210 --> 31:20.030
There's a parking lot down at Cass park.

31:20.060 --> 31:22.090
The girls have their johns park there.

31:22.120 --> 31:25.160
Detective Benning,can you call any units
at Cass park. I'll hold on the line.

31:25.170 --> 31:28.260
What about Kelly? Is there a reason
why you wouldn't have seen her leave?

31:28.270 --> 31:30.540
I don't know. I could
have been distracted.

31:30.550 --> 31:32.730
- So she was here before.
- Yeah.

31:32.740 --> 31:34.340
Was there any reason
she would sneak off?

31:34.370 --> 31:37.440
I don't know what she does.
She's fresh meat out here.

31:37.450 --> 31:42.010
Ok. Detroit P.D. confirmed two prostitutes
with johns in the parking lot at Cass park.

31:42.020 --> 31:43.630
So we're short one girl.

31:43.660 --> 31:45.700
You knew William's sister Lee?

31:45.720 --> 31:47.100
You gonna hook me up?

31:47.130 --> 31:49.850
Tell them if you knew my sister.

31:49.860 --> 31:51.680
Yeah,I knew her.

31:51.700 --> 31:54.370
Is there anyplace that she
would have taken clients?

31:54.380 --> 31:56.300
Maybe somewhere the
other girls wouldn't go.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.910
She didn't do it regular.

31:57.940 --> 32:01.170
She'd try to get a real
job,but then she'd slip.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.950
Then about a month and a half
ago she said she was leaning.

32:03.970 --> 32:05.910
That's when I took her to my mom's.

32:05.930 --> 32:08.340
I ain't seen her since.

32:09.340 --> 32:14.010
Lee disappeared,I begged William to
find her,but it wasn't fair to him.

32:14.040 --> 32:16.280
I'm sure he wanted to find
her as much as you did.

32:16.310 --> 32:21.440
He'd just gotten home. He lost his
leg,and he was going to physical therapy.

32:21.450 --> 32:23.800
He hadn't even processed
what happened to him yet.

32:23.830 --> 32:25.730
- But he found her.
- First time.

32:25.740 --> 32:28.700
She came home for 2 weeks and
I had her going to meetings.

32:28.710 --> 32:30.650
I even got her onto welfare.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.880
So what happened?

32:31.910 --> 32:35.430
The day after the first
check came,she disappeared.

32:35.440 --> 32:38.120
- Wait,what was that date?
- The 2nd?

32:38.520 --> 32:40.640
- What if that's it?
- What?

32:40.650 --> 32:45.100
Lee Hightower was abducted on the 2nd,the
day after she cashed a welfare check.

32:45.110 --> 32:47.850
- So?
- Look at the dates of the other abductions.

32:47.860 --> 32:51.150
All the men are abducted around
the first and the 15th of the month.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.830
When welfare checks are issued.

32:52.860 --> 32:55.400
What if he's not intentionally
clustering the male/female?

32:55.430 --> 32:57.390
What if this is how he
best isolates his victims?

32:57.430 --> 33:00.540
You think he has a way to get them alone
based on how they cash their checks?

33:00.560 --> 33:02.810
And then the rest of the month he
resorts to picking up prostitutes.

33:02.840 --> 33:03.880
It would explain the pattern.

33:03.920 --> 33:06.170
We need to find out where
these men cash their checks.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.130
We don't have last names.
There's no way to find them.

33:08.140 --> 33:10.630
Morgan,figure out how people on the
streets are cashing their welfare checks.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.940
- Garcia.
- Sir.

33:11.950 --> 33:15.820
I need you to find out if Lee
Hightower ever cashed a welfare check.

33:15.830 --> 33:18.380
Ok. I'm typing my fastest.

33:20.510 --> 33:22.130
Walter!

33:26.890 --> 33:30.650
Listen,when someone out here's on welfare,
where do they go when they get their check?

33:31.650 --> 33:33.950
- It depends what they want.
- What do you mean?

33:33.960 --> 33:35.500
Those checks have strings.

33:35.530 --> 33:37.710
You gotta either spend
it on food or lodging.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.410
Ok.

33:39.420 --> 33:41.890
A lot of people out here
don't want food or lodging.

33:41.910 --> 33:44.600
This is one of those money
secrets you were talking about?

33:44.610 --> 33:46.620
There's a motel on third.

33:46.640 --> 33:50.360
Uh, Greyburn Lodge, 43608 Third Street.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.290
Lee Hightower cashed her
check there on the 2nd.

33:52.320 --> 33:55.740
They'll cash your check for 30 cents on the
dollar providing you don't take the room.

33:55.770 --> 33:58.360
So you walk away with drug
money,but you're still on the street.

33:58.380 --> 33:59.650
Dope fiends keep it quiet.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.800
They don't want anyone knowing	
they're holding that much cash.

34:03.180 --> 34:05.010
It explains why they're alone.

34:05.060 --> 34:06.760
And they'd be looking to score.

34:06.790 --> 34:09.520
If they thought somebody was a
dealer,they'd walk right up to them.

34:10.270 --> 34:12.850
- Walter,thank you.
- Thank you.

34:15.420 --> 34:18.030
Don't spend it all in one place, sweetie.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.320
- What's going on?
- Police.

34:55.330 --> 34:58.230
FBI. Have you seen any of these men?

35:00.190 --> 35:02.040
- Maybe.
- Not maybe. Yes or no.

35:02.050 --> 35:05.020
Have you been giving them cash	 in
exchange for their welfare checks?

35:05.040 --> 35:09.430
They need the cash and I need the
business,and nobody gets hurt,folks.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.850
Garcia,trace William's sister to this
location	 on the night that she disappeared.

35:12.870 --> 35:15.130
- The others were here,too.
- You seen this girl?

35:15.140 --> 35:17.570
Yeah,she was here maybe 15 minutes ago.

35:17.580 --> 35:19.250
Did anybody approach her when she left?

35:19.270 --> 35:23.160
There was a dealer across the street.
He just sits there and then they signal.

35:23.170 --> 35:24.620
Do you know his name?

35:24.640 --> 35:29.600
No,I never seen his face.
Just the car. They all use him.

35:31.190 --> 35:32.860
That's it.

35:33.650 --> 35:36.620
Get this photo to every
agent, every border cross.

35:36.630 --> 35:38.460
Car's a dark-colored American sedan.

35:38.480 --> 35:42.320
I want full searches of anything that
even remotely matches the description.

35:42.330 --> 35:45.030
Thanks for putting your ass
on the line over Hightower.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.160
Thanks for being right.

36:03.650 --> 36:05.950
- Anything?
- No,sir.

36:23.070 --> 36:26.250
No! No!

36:43.390 --> 36:45.510
They should have tried to make
the cross at least an hour ago.

36:45.540 --> 36:47.060
Any word from the off-road sites?

36:47.090 --> 36:50.190
I have agents at every known
drug smuggling entry. Nothing.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.880
This unsub's smart. Everything
about his plan is well researched.

36:52.890 --> 36:54.730
I think his border crossings
would be consistent.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.640
Are there former shipping lanes
somebody could have studied in advance?

36:57.670 --> 36:58.750
Nothing marked.

36:58.760 --> 37:02.640
Hunters might know the terrain,but
it's word of mouth. Nothing documented.

37:02.650 --> 37:05.220
- What about the underground railroad?
- How so?

37:05.230 --> 37:09.630
In the civil war,Detroit was the last stop for
a slave before they escaped to freedom in Canada.

37:09.890 --> 37:11.580
They made the crossing in this area.

37:11.600 --> 37:15.770
He's right. But there aren't any historical
landmarks that register the crossing points.

37:15.780 --> 37:16.550
Well,if I remember right,

37:16.560 --> 37:20.170
they built a series of victorian homes
along the river to signify safe passage.

37:20.180 --> 37:21.840
Some of those homes might still exist.

37:21.880 --> 37:25.820
We know your sister's cell phone
registered at a tower near Port Huron.

37:25.830 --> 37:27.990
He had to be close by
when he crossed the border.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.400
- Garcia.
- Present.

37:29.410 --> 37:33.990
Is it possible to cross-reference
civil war maps with victorian homes

37:34.020 --> 37:36.310
that still exist in the Port Huron area?

37:36.330 --> 37:39.870
Well,I'm gonna take that
question as rhetorical and...

37:40.170 --> 37:43.930
Got one. 3 miles south
of the blue water bridge.

37:43.940 --> 37:46.760
- Can you send me a GPS map?
- Coming now.

37:47.550 --> 37:49.970
Thanks. Prentiss,you and William come
with me. The rest of you stay here.

37:49.980 --> 37:52.630
We might need to be mobile in a hurry.

37:56.130 --> 37:58.270
Garcia's sure this is the spot?

37:58.290 --> 38:01.020
The house is inland. Access
from the water would be here.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.290
There's nothing here.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.970
Let's split up. The river's over here.

38:32.780 --> 38:35.140
Over here!

38:42.010 --> 38:45.780
Looks like he might have stashed
cars on either side of the river.

38:48.780 --> 38:50.970
The license plate is missing.

38:53.460 --> 38:55.250
Garcia,I need you to run a vin number.

38:55.270 --> 38:58.530
379-november-2-papa-44

38:58.540 --> 39:01.590
You got that?

39:03.400 --> 39:05.920
Vehicle belongs to one Mason Turner.

39:05.940 --> 39:07.040
What do you know about him?

39:07.070 --> 39:10.460
Age 39, went to undergrad in Toronto,

39:10.470 --> 39:13.740
graduated second in his class from
michigan medical institute 2000,

39:13.750 --> 39:16.380
went on to work for a public
health organization in Detroit.

39:16.410 --> 39:18.020
We got him. Do you have an address?

39:18.820 --> 39:22.040
Yes. Looks like a farm.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.150
Please... Don't do this.

39:50.160 --> 39:54.100
I won't tell anybody. Just let me go.

39:56.510 --> 39:58.770
I don't even know where we are.

39:58.790 --> 40:02.070
Please don't do this. Please!

40:04.590 --> 40:06.340
Who is that?

40:36.390 --> 40:38.960
You 4 take the exterior.
We'll take the house.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.090
Fought on other people's turf before.

40:43.130 --> 40:44.910
You don't walk into
this situation unarmed.

40:44.930 --> 40:46.920
I can't give you a gun,William.

40:46.930 --> 40:48.330
I got 10 years active duty.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.490
The man we find might
have killed your sister.

40:50.500 --> 40:53.280
I need answers. If I
shoot him,I get nothing.

40:53.290 --> 40:58.000
I'm sorry. Stay close. What
we find might not be easy.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.850
I just need to know.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.730
Prentiss. Check this out.

41:38.620 --> 41:41.050
We're in the right place.

41:57.490 --> 42:00.310
- Sir,are you all right?
- What the hell are you?

42:01.130 --> 42:02.950
Did someone do this to you?

42:02.960 --> 42:05.550
Get the hell out of my house.

42:05.560 --> 42:06.650
You're Mason Turner?

42:06.680 --> 42:08.650
That's not your business.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.360
He's our unsub?

42:26.340 --> 42:28.620
Stop! No!

42:33.040 --> 42:35.740
No! No!

42:39.790 --> 42:42.480
Who the hell are you people?

42:43.790 --> 42:45.190
You are Mason Turner?

42:45.220 --> 42:46.470
Dr. Turner.

42:46.500 --> 42:50.340
This is my sister,Lee
Hightower. Has she been here?

42:50.350 --> 42:53.560
Can someone please tell me
what the hell is going on.

42:53.570 --> 42:54.720
We're with the FBI.

42:54.750 --> 42:58.450
We've been invited by the RCMP to
assist in an ongoing investigation.

42:58.480 --> 43:01.280
You haven't been invited into my home.

43:01.300 --> 43:03.310
My Canadian home.

43:03.340 --> 43:06.150
Now get the hell out before
I call the proper authorities.

43:06.160 --> 43:10.680
- Sir,we've been invited by the proper authorities.
- Telephone,dial number 911.

43:10.690 --> 43:12.570
911. What's your emergency?

43:12.580 --> 43:16.680
This is Dr. Mason
Turner,11712 Scott Road.

43:16.700 --> 43:18.170
That won't be necessary.

43:18.200 --> 43:21.950
I want these people out of my home.
They don't have any right to be here.

43:21.960 --> 43:25.910
Agent Rossi,Agent Hotchner,may
I have a word with you,please?

44:14.570 --> 44:16.270
Help me!

44:24.440 --> 44:26.200
Help me!

44:26.860 --> 44:28.640
Did you hear that?

44:29.310 --> 44:31.460
What?

44:32.270 --> 44:34.560
Was that a scream?

44:37.970 --> 44:39.050
Anything?

44:39.090 --> 44:41.670
I don't even know what
direction in came from.

44:42.370 --> 44:44.580
That's another reason
I hate these damn woods.

44:44.600 --> 44:46.220
It messes with the sound.

44:46.250 --> 44:47.740
You said this would be the unsub.

44:47.770 --> 44:49.620
Everything points to him,inspector.

44:49.640 --> 44:50.770
The profile was right.

44:50.790 --> 44:53.170
Does that man look capable
of abducting anyone?

44:53.200 --> 44:54.000
Relax,Jeff.

44:54.020 --> 44:57.030
I let a suspect who tried to
kill my border agents out of jail,

44:57.060 --> 45:01.700
a man who actually confessed to the crimes
we're investigating,because I believed you.

45:01.710 --> 45:02.800
And you were wrong.

45:02.830 --> 45:05.260
- It doesn't always make sense initially.
- No.

45:05.270 --> 45:10.370
I'm taking my prisoner back to the
station,and you can all go home. Excuse me.

45:27.640 --> 45:29.740
Pretty.

45:35.430 --> 45:37.470
What's this thing?

45:37.480 --> 45:40.690
I don't know as much about
pig farms as you might think.

45:41.850 --> 45:46.810
Prentiss. That's a handprint.
That looks like blood.

45:53.080 --> 45:55.350
Oh,my god.

45:56.210 --> 46:00.060
Hotch! The box next to the pigs--
it's like a garbage bin or something.

46:00.070 --> 46:04.920
It's full of nothing but bloody
shoes,all different sizes,male and female.

46:04.930 --> 46:07.600
We said we were looking for 10 missings?

46:07.620 --> 46:10.710
There's gotta be over 100
pairs of shoes in that thing.

46:22.110 --> 46:25.720
These are... They belong to victims?

46:25.730 --> 46:27.610
Possibly.

46:27.970 --> 46:29.600
Why just the shoes?
Where are the bodies?

46:29.610 --> 46:32.380
I don't think there's
going to be any bodies,guys.

46:32.390 --> 46:35.410
Pigs are omnivores.
They'll eat anything.

46:35.420 --> 46:38.690
By anything,I mean... Anything.

46:48.410 --> 46:51.610
- What happened?
- I'm going to take these cuffs off you.

46:53.170 --> 46:55.080
What's going on?

46:56.120 --> 46:57.630
We're still not sure,William.

46:57.660 --> 47:00.870
- Did you find my sister?
- No.

47:01.190 --> 47:03.100
But...

47:04.240 --> 47:08.700
Would you happen to know what kind of
shoes she was wearing when she went missing?

47:09.310 --> 47:11.930
She was...

47:20.500 --> 47:23.990
- Is Bedwell alright? - He will be. He has every 
available cop in Ontario on the way here.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.350
You find anyone in the house?

47:25.380 --> 47:27.130
Mason Turner.

47:27.520 --> 47:28.880
Is he in custody?

47:28.900 --> 47:31.310
- Uh,not exactly.
- But he's not going anywhere.

47:31.320 --> 47:32.350
He's quadriplegic.

47:32.380 --> 47:35.460
Paralyzed from the neck down.
JJ's in there with him right now.

47:35.720 --> 47:37.990
Well,that's a pretty
good criminal defense.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.010
I'll go talk to him.

47:40.530 --> 47:43.780
- Morgan,do you have the contact number for the Detroit detective?
- Benning? Yeah.

47:43.790 --> 47:47.710
Yeah,we're gonna need their open missings so
we can make identifications on this property.

47:47.720 --> 47:49.690
Right.

47:50.640 --> 47:53.070
I think that laptop is his
sole communications device.

47:53.090 --> 47:56.090
Which means data files
on hard drives,records.

47:58.440 --> 48:02.540
B.A.U. tech center,where you should definitely
pay attention to the girl behind the curtain.

48:02.570 --> 48:08.110
Garcia,I need you in Ontario a.s.a.p. at the
farmhouse that the unsub's car was registered to.

48:08.850 --> 48:10.160
Yes,sir. What should I bring?

48:10.170 --> 48:12.270
We need forensic recovery from a laptop.

48:12.300 --> 48:14.360
I'll tell you more when you get here.
I don't want this over the phone.

48:14.370 --> 48:17.910
- And the next flight,Garcia.
- Ok. On my way.

48:19.830 --> 48:22.610
Oh,my. Not over the phone.

48:23.930 --> 48:26.940
I dot think we're gonna
be in Kansas anymore.

48:27.390 --> 48:29.760
Reid,will you let Bedwell know
that we're gonna need a warrant

48:29.770 --> 48:32.590
to examine the laptop
and the hard drives. Reid.

48:32.910 --> 48:34.970
- How long do you think it would take?
- To get a warrant?

48:34.980 --> 48:37.420
No. For the pigs to...

48:37.430 --> 48:41.260
Depending on the size and condition of
the body when it's placed in the pen,

48:41.490 --> 48:43.660
it wouldn't be quick. Why?

48:43.950 --> 48:46.460
That means Kelly wasn't put in there.

48:46.470 --> 48:48.560
She's still here somewhere.

49:11.880 --> 49:14.380
My parents are gonna be looking for me.

49:15.670 --> 49:18.120
They're important people.

49:20.350 --> 49:22.870
Do you hear me?

49:25.670 --> 49:28.140
You better let me go.

49:39.670 --> 49:41.940
I'm serious!

49:41.950 --> 49:44.840
You're gonna be in big
trouble in you don't.

49:45.270 --> 49:51.410
Are you listening to me?
I'm sorry! Oh,I'm sorry.

49:51.770 --> 49:53.890
I
think--

50:00.920 --> 50:02.940
they're gonna need some help outside.

50:02.950 --> 50:05.140
Yes,sir.

50:11.180 --> 50:14.180
Did something happen out there?

50:14.190 --> 50:16.100
You know what we found.

50:16.110 --> 50:19.040
How could I? You see I'm paralyzed.

50:21.020 --> 50:23.370
Don't touch that.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.440
You know exactly what's out there.

50:26.460 --> 50:28.300
You watched the whole thing.

50:28.310 --> 50:30.530
Put that back.

50:31.880 --> 50:33.640
You like watching,don't you?

50:33.670 --> 50:36.450
This is not your jurisdiction.

50:36.460 --> 50:39.110
Oh,I'm not gonna arrest you.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.800
Stop that!

50:40.810 --> 50:44.040
Phone. Dial
number-- no.

50:46.290 --> 50:48.250
You can't do this to me.

50:48.280 --> 50:50.000
I'm not doing anything to you.

50:50.030 --> 50:52.640
In fact,you don't even
have to talk to me.

50:52.660 --> 50:56.420
As you said,I have no
jurisdiction here.But...

50:56.430 --> 51:01.100
Almost every policeman in Ontario
is on their way to this farm,

51:01.110 --> 51:03.960
and they do have jurisdiction.

51:08.750 --> 51:14.560
Some very bad things have happened
here,and they're gonna discover all of them.

51:14.570 --> 51:17.740
Now,Mason...

51:19.100 --> 51:21.980
How many victims were there?

51:22.290 --> 51:25.650
100? More?

51:26.120 --> 51:28.120
Do you even know for sure?

51:28.130 --> 51:31.390
- I need my mirrors.
- No.

51:31.750 --> 51:37.190
What you need is something to
make you look less like the monster

51:37.200 --> 51:40.620
that we both know that you really are.

51:40.630 --> 51:42.330
How can you call me that?

51:42.360 --> 51:44.580
I've never laid a hand on anybody.

51:44.600 --> 51:50.930
You need to tell me where the other guy is
before he kills Kelly,your latest victim.

51:50.940 --> 51:54.940
So,how much time does she have,Mason?

51:54.970 --> 51:59.770
How much time do you have
before I'm unable to say

51:59.800 --> 52:02.150
that you helped me?

52:05.910 --> 52:09.530
- No,no,no,no.
- I think I have a concussion.

52:11.500 --> 52:14.200
- I need a hospital.
- No hospitals!

52:14.210 --> 52:17.090
I won't tell them about
you. Just drop me off.

52:17.100 --> 52:18.990
Hospitals are bad places!

52:19.030 --> 52:20.950
I really need to see a doctor.

52:21.320 --> 52:24.530
Mason says no hospitals!
Never no hospitals!

52:24.540 --> 52:28.020
Ok. Ok,no hospital.

52:31.260 --> 52:34.530
It was my brother... Lucas.

52:34.540 --> 52:39.040
He's crazy. He did all of it.

52:39.050 --> 52:41.670
He did this to me,too.

52:44.300 --> 52:48.920
I wanted to try to
stop him. How could I?

52:48.930 --> 52:50.740
Why didn't you call for help?

52:50.780 --> 52:54.620
I tried that once,but he found out.

52:54.840 --> 52:58.010
He beat me. He almost killed me.

52:59.200 --> 53:02.920
You don't understand what it's like
to be completely vulnerable to someone

53:02.930 --> 53:06.130
who's capable of the
things that he's done.

53:07.350 --> 53:09.260
Where is he right now?

53:09.280 --> 53:11.590
Oh,I wish I could help you.

53:11.610 --> 53:15.710
I don't know what he does
when he leaves me here.

53:15.720 --> 53:17.920
He has a girl with him.

53:17.950 --> 53:20.740
A young girl from Detroit.

53:20.750 --> 53:25.010
Then you... Should pray for her.

53:30.310 --> 53:33.590
There's a picture of
him in the other room.

53:34.410 --> 53:39.680
It was taken years ago,but
it still looks like him.

53:41.060 --> 53:43.670
I should warn you...

53:43.700 --> 53:46.410
He's crazy and very big.

53:46.420 --> 53:48.750
Inhumanely strong.

53:48.790 --> 53:52.080
When you find him,you
should warn everyone...

53:52.580 --> 53:56.850
If they don't kill him
first,he'll kill all of you.

54:19.170 --> 54:22.300
Good. Yep.

54:22.310 --> 54:25.240
Judge will sign the warrant for the
laptop first thing in the morning.

54:25.270 --> 54:26.840
Our tech should just
be getting there then.

54:26.860 --> 54:28.340
We got search-and-rescue
units coming.

54:28.360 --> 54:33.010
They're also our emergency response team,so
they'll be armed in case we come across something.

54:33.040 --> 54:36.040
When this hits the press,families of
missings are gonna come rushing out here.

54:36.070 --> 54:38.770
I'm gonna need some uniformed
officers to assist me.

54:38.780 --> 54:40.750
Come on,let's get you set up.

54:40.770 --> 54:42.470
Morgan,I want you to supervise
the evidence collection.

54:42.490 --> 54:44.540
I don't think the techs have
seen a scene like this before.

54:44.550 --> 54:47.190
- Has anyone?
- We have a picture.

54:47.690 --> 54:49.860
This is Lucas Turner, Mason's brother.

54:49.890 --> 54:51.510
According to Mason,he's the unsub.

54:51.540 --> 54:54.010
Mason claims he's a victim himself.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.920
Does Mason know where
Lucas would take the girl?

54:55.940 --> 54:57.150
Claims he has no idea.

54:57.170 --> 54:58.880
Reid, Lucas is your assignment.

54:58.910 --> 55:01.680
Find his room,his things,anything
that might tell us where he would go.

55:01.690 --> 55:03.170
- On it.
- One more thing.

55:03.180 --> 55:06.960
Mason warned me that his
brother is extremely psychotic.

55:06.990 --> 55:08.720
Says he won't go down without a fight.

55:08.750 --> 55:11.190
Prentiss,have JJ get the picture
and the description out to the press.

55:11.220 --> 55:12.720
When they get here,put
them to work for us.

55:12.740 --> 55:15.400
- Somebody's gonna notice a man that big.
- You got it.

55:15.410 --> 55:16.830
Dave.

55:18.970 --> 55:21.730
According to Mason,Mason claims to.
It sounds like you don't believe him.

55:21.740 --> 55:24.740
He also said we shouldn't even
try to talk to his brother.

55:24.770 --> 55:26.850
We should shoot first.

55:26.860 --> 55:28.470
Well,that's either helpful advice...

55:28.490 --> 55:31.100
Or a way for half a team
to clean up loose ends.

55:31.120 --> 55:34.290
Either way,this is some family.

55:43.430 --> 55:44.990
If you have photos,I can take them here.

55:45.020 --> 55:48.700
We have police officers that can
answer questions about your loved ones.

55:50.060 --> 55:52.610
Andre,these are the unsub's coveralls.

55:52.630 --> 55:54.310
It looks like they haven't
been washed in some metime,

55:54.340 --> 55:56.430
- so it should be a good scent source.
- Got it.

55:57.840 --> 55:59.690
Your warrant.

55:59.700 --> 56:02.140
- You can search all his files and hard drives.
- Great.

56:02.150 --> 56:03.260
Let's go serve it.

56:03.270 --> 56:05.530
- Garcia find me something.
- Yes,sir.

56:26.010 --> 56:27.710
Agent Morgan.

56:28.540 --> 56:31.560
- You got here fast.
- Detroit's not that far.

56:33.860 --> 56:35.460
Did you bring the case files?

56:35.480 --> 56:38.770
- I got 35 open missings.
- That's all?

56:39.420 --> 56:41.560
That's not enough?

56:41.910 --> 56:44.410
- 89 pairs.
- 89?

56:44.420 --> 56:47.110
So far.

56:47.460 --> 56:49.310
God.

56:49.740 --> 56:52.490
I don't think god's been
out here in a long time.

56:56.510 --> 56:59.500
- How is he?
- How would you be?

56:59.970 --> 57:02.470
He asked for help and nobody
ever looked for his sister.

57:02.760 --> 57:04.260
We did the best we could.

57:04.290 --> 57:05.760
Ignoring him was the best you could do?

57:05.780 --> 57:08.010
We were undermanned.

57:09.030 --> 57:11.780
Well,these are just all throwaway
people to you anyway,right?

57:11.790 --> 57:15.010
- That is not fair.
- Isn't it?

57:15.310 --> 57:18.010
Agent Morgan! Can you come here,please?

57:20.040 --> 57:22.340
Grab your case files.

57:23.750 --> 57:26.720
Mason says his brother sometimes
sleeps on the couch in the living room

57:26.730 --> 57:29.410
or disappears for days at a time.

57:29.730 --> 57:32.220
- He doesn't have a room?
- Not according to Mason.

57:32.230 --> 57:34.610
Keep looking around. They've
lived here their whole lives.

57:34.950 --> 57:37.880
There's got to be something here
that gives us an idea of who he is.

57:41.130 --> 57:44.780
- That is my personal property.
- Not anymore.

57:44.790 --> 57:49.240
- I showed you the warrant.
- I have research on there. Proprietary research.

57:49.250 --> 57:53.030
Intellectual property. I helped you.

57:53.040 --> 57:54.710
I told you everything I know.

57:54.750 --> 57:56.830
If what you've told me
is your total involvement,

57:56.840 --> 58:00.100
there shouldn't be anything on this
computer that you don't want us to see.

58:01.760 --> 58:03.580
Do you need anything, Dave?

58:03.860 --> 58:07.920
No. Me and Mason are having
a great time. Aren't we,Mason?

58:14.540 --> 58:19.390
Once I saw my brother
strangle a man so forcefully,

58:19.400 --> 58:22.620
blood dripped from his eye sockets.

58:24.580 --> 58:27.960
I'm not talking petechia.

58:28.860 --> 58:32.770
Actual dripping blood.

58:34.800 --> 58:38.000
He can be very volatile...

58:38.280 --> 58:40.590
When things don't go his way.

58:40.620 --> 58:42.960
Are you trying to scare me?

58:42.980 --> 58:45.080
I'm just saying.

58:45.100 --> 58:48.900
You better hurry up
and find that girl,or...

58:52.560 --> 58:55.720
He's gonna tear her to pieces.

58:59.700 --> 59:03.100
Is someone supposed to
call you on that phone?

59:05.480 --> 59:08.070
You don't have to hide
it. I'm trying to help.

59:08.500 --> 59:11.180
Maybe you don't get service in here.

59:12.630 --> 59:15.620
- Are we underground?
- What?

59:15.970 --> 59:17.630
The walls look like we're underground.

59:17.670 --> 59:20.290
If we are,your phone
probably won't work in here.

59:20.300 --> 59:23.540
- Won't work?
- Not if we're underground.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.110
William.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:29.230
Have you found something?

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.370
She asked me for them.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:01.910
Before I went back over
there,before I lost my...

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.860
William,I'm really sorry.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.020
She didn't want me to go back.

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.720
It was like she knew
something was gonna happen.

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:28.760
I should have listened to her.

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:04.470
Hotch. I gotta get out of here.

01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:06.100
Where?

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.660
I'm gonna hook up with
Prentiss on the search party.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.200
I--I can't stand
around here.

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:12.840
Ok. Keep in touch.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.680
If you're waiting for someone
to call you,they can't.

01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:26.780
He always calls.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.090
- I'm telling you,he can't.
- He always calls!

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.640
But if there's no service,he can't.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.070
Reid.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.320
Up here. Hey, I found out where he sleeps.

01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:37.460
So Mason was lying?

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:40.800
I find it hard to believe he didn't
know his brother was living in the barn.

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:42.490
Anything up there that's
gonna help us find him?

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:44.380
No,nothing yet. I will say this,thoug-

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:46.620
- I doubt that he's psychotic.
- Why is that?

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:50.880
There's a collection of drawings up here that
suggest autism or moderate mental retardation.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:55.210
Now,retardation and psychosis in the
exact same subject is exceedingly rare.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.820
It's more likely he doesn't fully
understand the acts that he's committed.

01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:00.540
Anything to suggest a violent nature?

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:04.330
Nothing in the drawings. They do
suggest someone's been watching him.

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:05.520
He's very childlike.

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:10.360
I think that when we find him,he's
gonna be scared and probably confused.

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.070
You think he'll fight?

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.560
Uh,yeah,I don't know,maybe.

01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:18.730
Hey,Hotch.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.580
Do you ever get the feeling that
a case isn't going to end well?

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:26.230
Reid,keep looking. This girl needs us.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:29.940
Maybe you should go outside.

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:34.790
- What?
- And walk around out there until you get your call.

01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:36.470
No.

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:39.180
- You really should go.
- He'll call me!

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.690
Don't you say he won't call me!

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:46.940
- Don't you say he won't call me!
- Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Please!

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.510
Help me.

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.480
Mommy?

01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:56.580
I want to go. I want to go home. Mommy!

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:01.750
You've been with this
team what,2 years,right?

01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:04.020
- Almost 3 already.
- It's 7 for me.

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:05.880
I mean,that's all I've been
thinking about all day...

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.640
Is the entire time I've been with
the B.A.U.,working almost nonstop,

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:11.640
Having no real life,these brothers
have been out here killing 89 people

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.230
and we didn't even know about it.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.000
Well,we know now. And
we'll make them pay.

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:19.880
But how many others are still out
there,Prentiss,hmm,hunting and killing?

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:23.850
I mean,the thing is,no matter what
we do,no matter how hard we work,

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.090
No matter how good we are at what
we do,this is never gonna end.

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.690
Got some markings up ahead there.

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:32.710
The tree line.

01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:40.590
He must have gone in the water.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.000
If the dogs lose that scent,it's gonna be
nothing but a needle in a big old haystack.

01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:46.000
Maybe we should split up,take
either side of the stream.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:48.310
He might have come back
out somewhere up there.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.140
As long as I don't have to hang
out at that damn pig farm,I'm good.

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:56.840
Ok,defense system,let's
see what you're made of.

01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:01.890
Bang--like berlin-- another
wall falls,the world opens up.

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:03.940
There you are,inner core.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:07.060
Change password--
let's go with oz.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.650
Oh,I'm feeling so dorothy gale today.

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:12.570
Auntie em would be so proud...

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:31.280
- No!
- I'm sorry,I'm sorry.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.570
What?

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:37.780
Mas... Mason says I
always get mad too hard.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.640
What's your name? My name is Kelly.

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:54.370
Mason says never,nev-never no names.

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:57.750
Doesn't Mason want us to be friends?

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.930
Friends?

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.370
Garcia?

01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:16.740
- They were doing experiments.
- Experiments?

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.760
Unsuccessful ones.

01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:21.880
He tried to fix himself.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.840
Would it be better if
it was all for nothing?

01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:26.340
They were human beings.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:30.140
They were transients and
drug users and prostitutes.

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:33.020
They were useless to society.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:36.890
I gave them the chance
to be part of a cure.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.120
To be of use.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:40.850
- But that's--
- that's science.

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:43.130
No,it isn't.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:46.580
So you got some information
off my laptop. So what?

01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:50.650
What jury's gonna believe I
had the power to kill anyone?

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:56.900
I haven't been able to move
from the neck down for 7 years.

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:02.270
Even if you could
convict me of something...

01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:07.920
What punishment could be worse
than the life I already lead?

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.370
Find my idiot brother.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:18.590
Exact your pound of flesh
and leave me the hell alone.

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:24.250
No.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.670
It's ok. You can tell me your name.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.040
Lu-Lucas.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.470
That's a nice name.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.920
A very nice name.

01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:42.130
Do you have any food,Lucas?

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.720
Food?

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:50.480
I'm hungry. I threw up all
my food when I was sick.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.920
I really need some food.

01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:00.070
- Ok.
- Oh,no. Wait.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.270
I thought we were friends.

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:05.140
You don't have to tie me up,Lucas.

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.630
M-Mason says always.

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:12.470
Mason doesn't want us
to be friends,remember?

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:17.370
You don't have to tie me
up,Lucas. That's how friends act.

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:23.319
I really need some food.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.350
Ok.

01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:50.090
They were doing experiments.

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.460
- Spinal regeneration?
- Probably.

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:54.470
He was definitely trying to fix himself.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:56.970
Stem cell harvesting? The
equipment's far too unsophisticated.

01:08:56.979 --> 01:08:59.380
There's no way it
would have ever worked.

01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:02.420
You were a prosecutor,Hotch.
Could you convict this guy?

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:06.510
A quadriplegic who clearly
never touched any of the victims?

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.729
I don't know. We need
to concentrate on Kelly.

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:12.310
We can't worry about the
other stuff right now.

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:17.250
He might get away with this.

01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:46.060
Prentiss,I got someone sneaking
around about 30 yards ahead of me.

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.250
Copy that.

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.880
FBI! Do not move!

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.550
Berries.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.090
What the hell was wrong with you?

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.180
- I'm sorry,Mr. Lang.
- Can I go?

01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:52.440
Uh,not yet,sir.

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:55.620
Have you seen... This man?

01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:58.740
- That's Lucas Turner.
- You know him.

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:01.750
Oh,everybody knows Lucas.
He's--he's a little soft in the head.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.590
You guys wait around long
enough,he'll wander back home.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.610
- Can I go?
- Yes,sir. Thank you.

01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:16.310
What do you think's in that bag?

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.710
I'm pretty sure I don't want to know.

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.580
These are delicious,Lucas.

01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:30.190
Could I have some water?

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.270
- I have water.
- Could I have some?

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:43.550
This is a nice house you have,Lucas.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.980
Th--uh... This
is not a house.

01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:50.150
The--the farm
is our house.

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.150
What is this,then?

01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:53.860
It's for where we do hunting.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.020
Me--me and my dad and
my brother built it.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.820
But then he died.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.620
- Your brother died?
- What?

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.150
- You said-- -
Mason didn't die.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.130
He fell from the barn,but he didn't die.

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:06.360
It's ok. I'm sorry,Lucas.

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:08.510
I take--I take
care of him.

01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:10.820
It's all right. I just made a mistake.

01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:16.900
I didn't--I didn't--
I didn't push him.

01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:22.310
I didn't push Mason off the barn.

01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:25.840
How did you get hurt?

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.070
What difference does it make?

01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:31.280
None,I guess.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.460
My brother pushed me out of the loft.

01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:38.360
I wanted to sell the farm.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.460
I had just finished medical school.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.170
It would have given me a nice down
payment on a practice in the city.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.320
But the farm was all he knew.

01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:51.420
Lucas doesn't handle angry well.

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:55.130
Is that why you hate him?

01:13:55.140 --> 01:14:00.210
Hate him? He's done nothing but
take care of me every day since then.

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.370
You said not to even try
talking to him,if we find him.

01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:10.400
That sounds like you
want us to kill him.

01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:15.020
But... That's not hate.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:18.180
That's a favor.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.120
My brother couldn't survive without me.

01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:54.740
Lucas? Lucas,I have
to go to the bathroom.

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.710
I have to,you know,pee.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.260
Oh,well...

01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:06.300
- There's a bucket.
- No,I can't. Not in a bucket.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.170
There's a bucket.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:14.250
Lucas,that's ok for all of you
boys,but I'm a girl. I need privacy.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.530
You have to let me go outside.

01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:18.200
But there's a bucket.

01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:21.230
- It's ok. We're friends.
- Friend?

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:29.030
- Ok.
- Ok.

01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:38.710
- Anything else?
- Nothing that'll help find his brother.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.900
There's that cell phone he calls dozens
of times a day,but that appears to be off.

01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:45.170
And I tried to activate the GPS locator
on it,but I think it's an old phone,

01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:47.540
- so that's not gonna work either.
- Will you know if it comes on?

01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:48.650
I hope so.

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.580
- Keep at it.
- Yes,sir.

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.740
Ok,i--I can
go from here.

01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:10.600
- Go?
- No,I'm not leaving,Lucas.

01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:14.130
I just need some privacy.

01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:21.130
You wait over
there,Lucas... By the door.

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.810
It'll be all right.

01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:33.490
It's ok. It's ok.

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.740
Further.

01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:45.840
Further.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.550
Further.

01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:04.890
- Hey,how's it going?
- Just waiting for--

01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:07.660
oh,my god. The phone just turned back on.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.870
What? No.

01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:29.550
Kelly!

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.620
Almost done. Stay there,Lucas.

01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:38.770
- Kelly!
- Oh,my god. Agent Rossi,the phone is calling in!

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:45.550
Hello? Hello? My name is Kelly.

01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:48.400
Kelly,this is Penelope
Garcia. I'm with the FBI.

01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:50.880
Oh,my god,you have to help me.

01:17:50.890 --> 01:17:56.630
I'm somewhere in the woods being
held by a man named Lucas...

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.040
Kel-Kelly?

01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:01.080
- And he's--oh,my
god! - That's mine!

01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:02.810
Help me!

01:18:04.170 --> 01:18:06.270
- The phone's disconnected.
- Garcia,can you find the signal?

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:09.320
No,i--wait. Yes. I'm
hooked into the system.

01:18:09.330 --> 01:18:11.660
I should be
able to-- got it.

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.700
It's just west of
here,less than half a mile.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.840
That's all you can tell?

01:18:14.850 --> 01:18:16.880
It's in the woods. There
aren't any reference points.

01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:19.310
T the coordinates to my GPS and let
Morgan and Prentiss know in the field.

01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:20.250
Dave,Reid,let's go.

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:25.740
Mommy,don't! The FBI is coming!

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:29.570
Mason says everyone always lies! Always!

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:34.310
- You lied! Always--
- Let me go,you freak!

01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:43.240
Almost there. A couple hundred yards.

01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:59.220
Should be right here.

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.840
Not a freak.

01:19:05.850 --> 01:19:09.250
Lucas. Lucas,I'm sorry.

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:19.280
Should be right here.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.870
This is where the signal came from.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.480
There's nothing here.

01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:26.490
Kelly!

01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:31.160
Kelly!

01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:33.720
I--I
pushed him.

01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:38.080
- I pushed him.
- Lucas.

01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:41.870
I--I pushed him off the
barn. It was me. I did it.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:45.260
Sometimes I get so mad I get bad mad.

01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:47.430
Lucas,you don't have to.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.990
Bad,bad mad.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.320
Kelly!

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.680
We're in exactly the right spot.

01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:58.150
- All right,everybody split up.
- Kelly!

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.080
Kelly!

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:06.970
Kelly!

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:09.130
- Guys.
- Kelly!

01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:13.580
I'm a freak.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.660
Lucas,you are not a freak.

01:20:16.670 --> 01:20:19.380
I'm a freak.

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:26.200
Go ahead. Kelly shane?

01:20:26.210 --> 01:20:28.240
Down here!

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:31.180
Don't make any sudden moves
when they come down,ok?

01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:33.500
I'm bad. I'm bad.

01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:35.240
Lucas Turner,this is the FBI.

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.220
Just put your hands up,ok?

01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:17.190
Sometimes there are no words,no clever quotes
to neatly sum up what's happened that day.

01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:25.190
Sometimes you do everything
right,everything exactly right,

01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:28.890
and still you feel like you've failed.

01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:33.560
Did it need to end that way?

01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:37.700
Could something have been done to
prevent the tragedy in the first place?

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:44.350
89 murders at the pig farm.

01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:48.500
The deaths of Mason and Lucas
Turner make 91 lives snuffed out.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.600
Kelly shane will go
home and try to recover,

01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:59.680
to reconnect with her family,but
she'll never be a child again.

01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:03.080
William Hightower,who gave
his leg for his country,

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:06.250
gave the rest of himself to
avenge his sister's murder.

01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:12.170
That makes 93 lives forever altered,

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:16.890
not counting family and friends
in a small town in Sarnia, Ontario,

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:21.280
who thought monsters didn't exist until they
learned that they spent their lives with one.

01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:25.360
And what about my team?

01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:29.510
How many more times will they
be able to look into the abyss?

01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:35.990
How many more times before they won't ever recover
the pieces of themselves that this job takes?

01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:21.030
Like I said,sometimes
there are no words,

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:25.050
no clever quotes to neatly sum
up what's happened that day.

01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:27.210
You should have made a deal.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:32.010
Sometimes the day just...

01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:35.870
Ends.

01:24:36.305 --> 01:24:42.915
