00:02.000 --> 00:10.160
This programme contains strong
language and adult humour

00:10.160 --> 00:11.600
Hahahahaha!

00:11.600 --> 00:13.000
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:13.000 --> 00:15.520
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.480
# She's Mrs Brown

00:18.480 --> 00:21.400
# That's Mrs Brown

00:21.400 --> 00:24.400
# Oh, Mrs Brown... #

00:24.400 --> 00:25.920
What's wrong with you, Granddad?

00:25.920 --> 00:28.120
I haven't slept for three days.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.520
Hello!

00:35.520 --> 00:37.320
I'm just doing a bit of cleaning.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.400
I'm just about to take a break.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.840
God, I say cleaning like
it was a hobby. It's not.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.280
DOG BARKS

00:44.280 --> 00:46.080
Shut up, you feckin' mutt!

00:46.080 --> 00:47.400
LAUGHTER

00:47.400 --> 00:49.920
I...I'd better feed him. Hold on.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.240
Here, Spartacus!

00:53.240 --> 00:55.240
LAUGHTER

00:55.240 --> 00:56.280
SPARTACUS WHINES

00:56.280 --> 00:58.640
When I... Jesus, I never
opened the feckin' thing!

00:58.640 --> 01:00.360
LAUGHTER

01:00.360 --> 01:01.800
Here, Spartacus!

01:01.800 --> 01:03.000
LAUGHTER

01:03.000 --> 01:05.520
SPARTACUS GROWLS

01:05.520 --> 01:09.680
I had six children I reared
on my own and they weren't
as much trouble as you!

01:09.680 --> 01:12.160
Where was I? Oh, yeah...

01:12.160 --> 01:14.280
cleaning!

01:14.280 --> 01:16.360
Well, it's not as
if it goes unnoticed.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.800
I had Father Quinn round
the other day...

01:18.800 --> 01:20.760
he took one look at the house
and said,

01:20.760 --> 01:23.680
"Mrs Brown,
yourself and God keep a lovely home".

01:23.680 --> 01:25.800
I said "Thank you, Father"
but I'm thinking,

01:25.800 --> 01:28.000
"You should see it when
God has it on his own!"

01:28.000 --> 01:29.400
LAUGHTER

01:31.200 --> 01:34.080
I feel like I've
always been cleaning.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.920
When I was 18, I married his son,
Redser Brown,

01:37.920 --> 01:39.640
because of a condition I had...

01:39.640 --> 01:41.040
called pregnancy.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.880
LAUGHTER

01:42.880 --> 01:45.440
The next day, I started cleaning.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.760
Hiya, Mammy! Hello, Cathy, love.

01:47.760 --> 01:49.840
Ah! Granddad looks peaceful.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.360
Doesn't he! Hahaha!

01:51.360 --> 01:53.400
LAUGHTER

01:54.600 --> 01:56.200
Heading out on the big date, love?

01:56.200 --> 01:58.840
It's not a big date, Mammy.
It's just a quiet drink.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.280
Quiet drink! That's what all men say.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.200
They think vodka's a lubricant
to get your knickers off easy.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.480
LAUGHTER

02:05.480 --> 02:09.520
You may laugh, but I tell you,
one minute you're sipping
Piney Coladies, next...

02:09.520 --> 02:13.560
your legs are up in stirrups
with the doctor shouting,
"Don't push till I tell you!".

02:13.560 --> 02:15.960
I'll keep that in mind, so!

02:15.960 --> 02:17.920
You do that. Ah, why do I bother?

02:17.920 --> 02:20.920
Right, I'm off! Do you want
a cup of tea before you go, love?

02:20.920 --> 02:22.720
No, Mammy. Sure, I'm running late.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.480
Don't be breaking your neck,
he'll be feckin' late as well.

02:25.480 --> 02:26.840
Did Daddy always come late?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.640
LAUGHTER

02:33.040 --> 02:34.920
That's none of your feckin' business!

02:34.920 --> 02:36.400
LAUGHTER

02:36.400 --> 02:37.880
See you later!

02:37.880 --> 02:41.080
Cathy, love!
Yes, Mammy? You look fantastic!

02:41.080 --> 02:42.680
Thanks, Mammy.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.720
Keep them on!

02:43.720 --> 02:46.000
LAUGHTER

02:48.120 --> 02:49.760
I...I'm not just a cleaner.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.240
I have a market stall as well.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.680
I sell fruit and vegetables.
I suppose I'm a business woman!
Ha ha ha.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.840
I don't like customers
who come and just poke.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.160
They come and maul your fruit without
any feckin' reason whatsoever.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.800
I say to them, "Missus,
that's a banana, not a willy..."

03:06.800 --> 03:08.240
LAUGHTER

03:08.240 --> 03:11.040
"..it won't get bigger
if you squeeze it!"

03:11.040 --> 03:12.520
LAUGHTER

03:12.520 --> 03:13.880
Hahaha! Hahaha!

03:21.600 --> 03:23.000
There goes Happy Feet!

03:23.000 --> 03:25.600
LAUGHTER

03:25.600 --> 03:28.920
I better go in and see what's
happening in the North Pole.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.280
Hello, Dermot, son.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.600
Hello, Mammy.
What are you promoting this week?

03:34.600 --> 03:36.720
Chocolate biscuits.
Oh, lovely...

03:36.720 --> 03:37.760
what kind?

03:37.760 --> 03:41.040
LAUGHTER

03:41.040 --> 03:42.120
Kit Kats!

03:42.120 --> 03:43.640
LAUGHTER

03:43.640 --> 03:45.240
Dermot, love...

03:45.240 --> 03:47.600
quack, quack, quack, quack!

03:47.600 --> 03:48.840
LAUGHTER

03:48.840 --> 03:52.000
What's wrong, love? Why are you
such a sad little penguin?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.560
You're not in trouble
with the law again, are you?

03:54.560 --> 03:56.680
No, Mammy, it's Maria.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.160
Ah, the lovely Maria.
We've broken up.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.280
Bitch! Never liked her!

04:00.280 --> 04:02.680
LAUGHTER

04:02.680 --> 04:05.600
What did she do?
She's not a bitch, Ma.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.120
And she didn't do
anything, it's just... Yes?

04:08.120 --> 04:11.040
..to be honest Mammy, I'd rather
not talk about it right now.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.880
I understand...

04:12.880 --> 04:14.560
so what happened?

04:14.560 --> 04:17.520
Mammy! I'm not talking about it!

04:18.520 --> 04:20.040
Fine...

04:20.040 --> 04:23.120
Do you want a cup of tea?
No, I'm only on a quick break.

04:23.120 --> 04:26.640
Well, if it's only a quick break,
you should slip into the fridge
and relax!

04:26.640 --> 04:29.880
Hahahahaha! Slip into the... Hahaha!

04:29.880 --> 04:31.400
LAUGHTER

04:37.920 --> 04:39.120
THUMP!

04:39.120 --> 04:41.520
LAUGHTER

04:41.520 --> 04:44.120
It's very late to be studying.
Hi, Mammy.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.760
I can't sleep,
worrying about Dermot and Maria.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.120
Cathy...

04:51.120 --> 04:55.480
you amaze me the amount of work
and persistence you put
into everything you feckin' do.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.640
And I know I'm biased...
you're my only daughter

05:01.680 --> 05:04.960
..but the man who gets you will be...
he'll be the luckiest man on earth.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.400
Not bad for a widow bringing
up a girl on her own, hey?

05:09.400 --> 05:10.440
Am I right?

05:11.640 --> 05:12.760
Sorry, Mammy?

05:12.760 --> 05:15.280
LAUGHTER

05:15.280 --> 05:16.640
Nothing, it doesn't matter.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.440
Cathy, what am I going to
do about Dermot and Maria?

05:20.440 --> 05:25.680
Mammy...it's best if we all
just butt out and let them
sort it out themselves.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.120
BANG! BANG! BANG!

05:27.120 --> 05:29.200
What do you want, Granddad?

05:29.200 --> 05:30.720
I don't feel well.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.200
You're 92, you're not
supposed to fuckin' feel well!

05:33.200 --> 05:36.120
LAUGHTER

05:36.120 --> 05:37.520
Mammy! What?

05:37.520 --> 05:39.400
Maybe he really is sick.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.920
Don't take any chances.
Call the doctor!

05:41.920 --> 05:43.680
A doctor? At 80 euro a visit?!

05:43.680 --> 05:47.040
He's no health insurance.
At least he's insured for a funeral.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.160
Mammy!

05:49.600 --> 05:51.280
Fine. I'll call the doctor.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.320
This is all because of his
feckin' budgie! His budgie?

05:55.320 --> 05:56.640
Found him dead today.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.760
Well, he must be upset.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.640
He's at that age, love.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.880
His budgie dies,
he's sure he's going to be next.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.040
LAUGHTER

06:04.040 --> 06:06.200
With a bit of buckin' luck!

06:06.200 --> 06:08.760
LAUGHTER

06:11.720 --> 06:15.000
It's a sharp pain across
the shoulders and down the spine.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.840
How long has he had it?
Not him... ME!

06:17.840 --> 06:20.760
LAUGHTER

06:20.760 --> 06:23.160
Mrs Brown,
I'm here to examine Granddad.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.640
You're wasting your time with him,
he's fucked.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.640
LAUGHTER

06:27.640 --> 06:29.720
Only a matter of time,
isn't it, Granddad?

06:29.720 --> 06:31.040
Am I dying?

06:31.040 --> 06:32.240
Yes...Friday!

06:32.240 --> 06:35.320
LAUGHTER

06:35.320 --> 06:36.960
What's wrong with him, anyway?

06:36.960 --> 06:38.560
I'll have to run some tests.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.680
Tests! More feckin' money!

06:40.680 --> 06:44.160
I'll need a sample of his urine,
and a sample of his stool.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.160
LAUGHTER

06:46.160 --> 06:48.800
What'd he say?

06:48.800 --> 06:50.480
He wants your underpants.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.840
LAUGHTER

06:52.840 --> 06:56.760
Granddad, I need you to close
your mouth when I put it in.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.920
Hahahahaha!

06:58.920 --> 07:00.960
He's never heard that before!

07:00.960 --> 07:02.720
LAUGHTER

07:02.720 --> 07:04.920
I'm afraid I'll have
to do a rectal reading.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.200
Ooh!

07:06.200 --> 07:07.280
Can you help me?

07:07.280 --> 07:08.960
With buckin' pleasure!

07:08.960 --> 07:11.200
LAUGHTER

07:11.200 --> 07:13.280
Come on, Granddad!

07:13.280 --> 07:14.880
The doctor has a surprise for you!

07:14.880 --> 07:17.320
LAUGHTER

07:18.280 --> 07:20.480
Oooooh! Ooh hoo hoo!

07:20.480 --> 07:22.680
# Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! #

07:22.680 --> 07:24.040
LAUGHTER

07:24.040 --> 07:26.200
Would you like a cup of tea, Doctor?

07:26.200 --> 07:29.040
I wouldn't mind another one
of these. It's in the kitchen.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.560
Hahahahaha!

07:30.560 --> 07:31.680
LAUGHTER

07:31.680 --> 07:34.000
I'll get you a cup of tea, Granddad.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.880
I wish you could see it
from this side!

07:37.880 --> 07:40.000
You look like a big buckin'
toffee apple.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.400
LAUGHTER

07:41.400 --> 07:44.000
Oooooooh!

07:44.000 --> 07:49.480
Granddad! What are you doing there
in that state? Come on... fix
yourself!

07:49.480 --> 07:51.640
Now, sit down.

07:51.640 --> 07:52.720
No!

07:52.720 --> 07:56.640
Granddad! Come on, sit down.
No! No! No!

07:56.640 --> 07:58.200
Arrrgh!

07:58.200 --> 08:01.840
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

08:03.360 --> 08:04.400
Now...

08:05.840 --> 08:09.040
..now, Granddad,
isn't that much better?

08:09.040 --> 08:13.280
LAUGHTER

08:14.880 --> 08:17.200
Granddad! Hahahahaha!

08:17.200 --> 08:18.360
What are you doing?

08:18.360 --> 08:21.240
Come on, Granddad. Now
we're going to play Treasure Hunt!

08:21.240 --> 08:26.760
LAUGHTER

08:26.760 --> 08:28.720
No, Mrs Brown. I'm afraid it's gone.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.960
Gone?! I'm not paying for that!

08:31.960 --> 08:35.760
Now, wait a minute...er, gone?

08:35.760 --> 08:37.520
Arrgh!

08:37.520 --> 08:39.360
Is that bad? Is that dangerous?

08:39.360 --> 08:40.840
Get him to hospital today.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.120
We'll explore the cavity then.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.280
Explore the cavity! What?

08:47.280 --> 08:49.440
He's going potholing!

08:49.440 --> 08:51.120
LAUGHTER

08:51.120 --> 08:53.560
Goodbye, Mrs Brown.
Goodbye, Doctor.

08:55.680 --> 08:58.320
Now you've heard of
"Doctor Dolittle"...

08:58.320 --> 09:00.200
there goes "Doctor Do-Fuck-All"!

09:00.200 --> 09:03.080
LAUGHTER

09:03.080 --> 09:06.080
You're going to hospital, Granddad...

09:06.080 --> 09:07.920
and you're not coming fuckin' back.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.880
LAUGHTER

09:09.880 --> 09:13.000
Mammy. Yes, love?
Did you see me Psychology magazine?

09:13.000 --> 09:16.080
I left it down here last night.
No and if you left it on that chair,

09:16.080 --> 09:17.520
it's probably up his arse!

09:17.520 --> 09:19.240
LAUGHTER

09:19.240 --> 09:21.280
Arse like a buckin' Dyson he has!

09:21.280 --> 09:23.760
LAUGHTER

09:23.760 --> 09:28.600
Cathy, there has to be something
I can do about Dermot and Maria.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.640
Mammy...

09:30.760 --> 09:34.600
..as I said,
we all need to just butt out.
I want to be involved...

09:34.600 --> 09:36.840
I want to be a leader!
Like your man in Iran,

09:36.840 --> 09:39.240
'Mock Mood Momamma Jibbidi
Get It Back Up Again'.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.200
LAUGHTER

09:40.200 --> 09:44.360
Mammy, of all people
you stay out of this. I mean it.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.920
Promise me you won't interfere.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.640
OK!

09:52.800 --> 09:55.080
Me? Interfere?

09:57.520 --> 09:59.760
LAUGHTER

10:04.120 --> 10:06.280
Biscuit, Maria? Thank you.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.840
Ah, I cut the edges off
so they fit in the mug.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.880
LAUGHTER

10:13.880 --> 10:16.720
Oh. I see.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.400
So, Maria, why are you torturing my
son?

10:21.760 --> 10:22.800
Excuse me?

10:22.800 --> 10:25.400
Well, you've obviously
done something to upset him.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.600
How can we make it right?

10:27.720 --> 10:29.280
Maybe if you apologise?

10:29.280 --> 10:31.120
Me? Apologise?

10:31.120 --> 10:33.920
That's the spirit, love!

10:33.920 --> 10:38.120
Mrs Brown,
I have no idea what Dermot has told
you about what's going on, but...

10:38.120 --> 10:41.160
maybe I should say I'm sorry
all right, sorry I ever met him,

10:41.160 --> 10:45.400
sorry I allowed myself to fall
in love with him and sorry I ever
got involved with his family.

10:45.400 --> 10:50.120
And sorry that he has to put up with
such a domineering matriarch as you!

10:50.120 --> 10:52.720
I was hoping for something shorter!

10:53.720 --> 10:57.840
Dermot, you're home, just in time.
Maria has something she
wants to tell you. You have?

10:57.840 --> 11:00.960
Yeah! I hope you and your mother
will be very happy together!

11:00.960 --> 11:03.440
Keep it short! Keep it short!
Now get stuffed!

11:03.440 --> 11:06.080
LAUGHTER

11:06.080 --> 11:08.320
DOOR SLAMS

11:08.320 --> 11:09.720
Do you want a cup of tea, love?

11:10.760 --> 11:12.600
What the hell happened here, Mammy?

11:12.600 --> 11:15.400
What the hell happened?
She came here, sat down,

11:15.400 --> 11:17.360
nibbled the biscuits and dunk...

11:17.360 --> 11:18.640
I don't know what to...

11:18.640 --> 11:20.680
She meant... What is this side...
So she...

11:20.680 --> 11:22.920
I'm here... Oh, yeah, wuzzah...
And she said...

11:22.920 --> 11:24.160
Don't you muck! Eh!

11:24.160 --> 11:28.200
Ohhh! Zem! Nice! You keep away!
Uzzah!

11:28.200 --> 11:30.200
It's no wonder you dumped her!

11:30.200 --> 11:32.200
LAUGHTER

11:32.200 --> 11:36.280
I didn't dump HER.
She broke up with me, because I
wouldn't move in with her.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.960
Leave home? Yes!
She wants us to move in together.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.440
It's far too early for that!

11:41.480 --> 11:42.520
I'm 33.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.360
Exactly!

11:45.360 --> 11:49.840
Mammy, I wish you'd stay
out of things and for once...

11:49.840 --> 11:51.480
mind your own business!

11:53.720 --> 11:56.360
You are my business!

11:57.640 --> 11:59.040
I'm...your mother...

11:59.040 --> 12:00.480
AUDIENCE: Awww. 

12:00.480 --> 12:03.000
It's a man in a fuckin' dress!

12:03.000 --> 12:06.240
LAUGHTER

12:08.240 --> 12:09.640
Here, Cathy...

12:09.640 --> 12:11.680
I believe your date was a disaster.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.160
I wouldn't say that, Winnie!

12:13.160 --> 12:15.440
You're better off, Cathy.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.240
Men, preverts!

12:17.240 --> 12:19.400
LAUGHTER

12:19.400 --> 12:22.560
They all look for one thing,
and don't need a com-pass!

12:22.560 --> 12:23.760
LAUGHTER

12:23.760 --> 12:26.680
Will you stop it, Mammy!
He wanted to go out and have a talk.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.320
Oh, a talk... yeah!
Talk about doin' it!

12:29.320 --> 12:31.320
LAUGHTER

12:32.920 --> 12:35.880
Mammy...
Hold on, where's me handbag?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.720
Feckin' hang on.

12:40.240 --> 12:47.480
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

12:53.480 --> 12:54.720
Me tablets are in it.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.040
LAUGHTER

12:57.040 --> 12:59.240
Mammy, my date was not a disaster!

12:59.240 --> 13:01.720
Well, when are you seeing him again?
I'm not.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.400
Disaster!

13:03.400 --> 13:06.000
LAUGHTER

13:06.000 --> 13:07.920
My Sharon's got herself a new...

13:07.920 --> 13:08.960
yoke.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.840
Boyfriend, Mrs McGoogan.
I've met him and he's very nice.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.840
One of the usual weirdos
Sharon picks?

13:13.840 --> 13:16.560
Actually he's a gentleman.
Gentleman, Betty?

13:16.560 --> 13:18.800
And what would you call a gentleman?
I dunno.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.920
Opens the door for you? Mmmm. Takes
your coat off when you go in?

13:21.920 --> 13:25.640
Mmmmm. Pulls the chair out
when you go to sit down. Aye!

13:25.640 --> 13:27.440
Dirty bastard!

13:27.440 --> 13:29.440
LAUGHTER

13:29.440 --> 13:31.840
That's all put on!

13:31.840 --> 13:33.640
He just wants to
play hide the sausage!

13:33.640 --> 13:36.640
LAUGHTER

13:36.640 --> 13:38.360
Will you stop it, Mammy.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.520
Not all men are sex maniacs!

13:40.520 --> 13:42.280
Yes, they are!

13:42.280 --> 13:43.800
They are! Aren't they, Winnie?

13:43.800 --> 13:47.360
Only last year, me and Winnie
went to that film festival,
The "Cock-a-Coh".

13:47.360 --> 13:48.920
Uh, what's the one with the...

13:48.920 --> 13:51.800
the motorbike and the swords and..

13:51.800 --> 13:55.080
Radiator! Gladiator! The Graduate!

13:55.080 --> 13:56.760
LAUGHTER

13:56.760 --> 13:59.440
We looked great with
our Liverpool hairdos.

13:59.440 --> 14:00.800
I had mine like Cilla Black,

14:00.800 --> 14:02.480
she had hers like fuckin' Ken Dodd.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.960
LAUGHTER

14:03.960 --> 14:07.080
We went to that picture house and
were only five minutes there...

14:07.080 --> 14:08.640
Five minutes. ..sitting down.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.520
I can't...I can't say it!
I'm too embarrassed. You tell them.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.040
Well, this... ..fella came over and
sat beside Winnie, right beside her.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.080
Right beside me! Right beside her!

14:20.600 --> 14:23.360
Five minutes later,
what's he do? What's he do?

14:23.360 --> 14:27.240
He takes his willy out... Out! Out!

14:27.240 --> 14:28.760
Oh, my God.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.360
The dirty bastard!...

14:31.480 --> 14:33.840
Winnie says to me,
"Look, look Agnes!"

14:33.840 --> 14:36.080
Well, I glanced...
I only feckin' glanced!

14:36.080 --> 14:37.640
LAUGHTER

14:37.640 --> 14:42.160
Oh, my God! What?
He was playing with it!

14:42.160 --> 14:45.840
Poor Winnie was disgusted.
I was disgusted. She was disgusted!

14:45.840 --> 14:48.800
Well, why didn't you move?
We couldn't move!

14:48.800 --> 14:50.760
He was using Winnie's hand.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.800
I'm only joking, Winnie!

15:02.240 --> 15:03.640
Oh, Jesus!

15:03.640 --> 15:04.720
Well, here...

15:05.760 --> 15:10.200
..it's because of weirdos like him
that I carry this.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.360
Jesus!

15:11.360 --> 15:13.560
Jesus Christ! What's that?

15:13.560 --> 15:20.240
It's a Tazer gun. If it was me
he sat beside, I'd give him one jab
of this and he'd be electrocuted.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.400
And she wonders why
she can't get a man.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.200
Vibrators!

15:29.240 --> 15:30.640
I beg your pardon, Winnie?

15:30.640 --> 15:34.920
Well, nowadays, that's what
the women do get, them vibrators!

15:34.920 --> 15:36.240
Shut the buck up, Winnie!

15:37.280 --> 15:39.080
Honest, Agnes, they do!

15:40.160 --> 15:41.680
I think I might get one meself!

15:44.040 --> 15:46.520
Well, make sure you get
one that takes diesel!

15:52.040 --> 15:54.320
Can you imagine her with a vibrator?

15:54.320 --> 15:56.480
"Winnie, are you coming
to Bingo on the bus?

15:56.480 --> 15:59.240
"No, I'm on a vibrator!"

15:59.240 --> 16:00.840
Hahahaha!

16:00.840 --> 16:04.800
Oh, Winnie,
stop that feckin' dirty talk!

16:07.840 --> 16:10.240
Hello? Yes? Is that Out Patients?

16:10.240 --> 16:12.160
I'm enquiring about Mr Brown.

16:13.480 --> 16:14.560
Brow-we-nuh.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.800
..Up his arse, that's him, yes.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.240
Very generous? Why, what did he do?

16:23.240 --> 16:26.800
Nurse, is he near you? Put him
on the phone will you, please?

16:26.800 --> 16:29.000
For God's sake, feckin' eejit.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.520
Hello Granddad. Yes, did you fill
out a form there this morning?

16:33.760 --> 16:35.360
Yeah. What did you tick off on it?

16:36.440 --> 16:38.280
Kidneys...

16:38.280 --> 16:40.040
heart...

16:40.040 --> 16:41.880
liver...

16:41.880 --> 16:43.520
that was a donor form!

16:45.040 --> 16:47.680
No, it wasn't
the feckin' breakfast menu!

16:49.880 --> 16:54.080
Well, you go back to her
and make sure you get all
the bits you went in with!

16:54.080 --> 16:57.440
I swear that man is getting
feckin' worse every day!

16:57.440 --> 16:59.600
Mammy? What?

16:59.600 --> 17:02.400
I really enjoyed those few
drinks we had last night!

17:02.400 --> 17:06.120
You had enough of them!
Yeah, one more vodka
and I'd have been under that table!

17:06.120 --> 17:09.080
One more pint of cider and I'd
have been under that buckin' barman!

17:11.320 --> 17:14.840
You wouldn't, would you, Mrs Brown?
Don't be ridiculous, Betty!

17:14.840 --> 17:19.720
It's so long since I had sex,
I can't even remember
who it is that gets tied up!

17:19.720 --> 17:21.440
Here, we'll miss the shops.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.040
You all right, Cathy? Yeah!

17:25.000 --> 17:26.440
Mammy...

17:26.440 --> 17:28.960
keep an eye on me Tazer
for me will you, it's charging.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.880
When the red light goes out,
plug it out.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.840
Red light out, plug out.
Cathy love...

17:35.120 --> 17:37.760
..what am I going to do about
Dermot and Maria?

17:37.760 --> 17:39.080
I think you've done enough.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.000
I have an idea. Cathy, you're
training to be a psychologist.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.520
Why not give them counselling?
Counselling?

17:45.520 --> 17:48.280
That's not a bad idea, Betty.
No, no, Cathy!

17:48.280 --> 17:50.800
I'll talk to Maria.
I'll see you later, Mrs Brown.

17:50.800 --> 17:54.240
See you later, Betty.
Cathy, Cathy love. Wait a second!

17:54.240 --> 17:56.400
We need to talk about this!
You can't just...

17:56.400 --> 17:57.720
PHONE RINGS

17:57.720 --> 17:59.200
Cathy! Cathy, love!

17:59.200 --> 18:02.680
You're not even qualified to feckin'
counsel for God's sake! Cathy!

18:02.680 --> 18:04.720
PHONE RINGS

18:04.720 --> 18:06.520
Cathy, for God's sake!

18:06.520 --> 18:08.040
Hello?

18:12.120 --> 18:16.320
PHONE RINGS

18:16.320 --> 18:19.680
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

18:28.200 --> 18:30.400
Hello? Hell, hell, hello?

18:30.400 --> 18:32.840
How do you do, do, do, do do?

18:34.120 --> 18:36.640
No, there, there's no O'Brien here...

18:36.640 --> 18:39.560
you have, have
the wr...wrong number.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.200
Are you fucking deaf?!

18:42.560 --> 18:44.200
Oh, hello, Father Quinn!

18:44.200 --> 18:46.680
LAUGHTER

18:56.120 --> 18:59.480
Hm! Counselling?
No counselling in my day.

18:59.480 --> 19:04.040
You must be joking.
If me and your father had problems,
we couldn't run to a counsellor!

19:04.040 --> 19:06.560
No way, Jose!

19:06.560 --> 19:10.240
We'd sort it out ourselves, like
adults! Into a room on our own...

19:10.240 --> 19:12.040
and I'd knock the shite out of him.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.360
We didn't need a counsellor...

19:17.360 --> 19:19.680
We needed a buckin' referee!

19:21.120 --> 19:23.040
Well, we're nearly
ready to get started.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
Oh, don't mind me.

19:26.400 --> 19:30.680
I'm just a fly on the wall,
a fly on the wall.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.040
Bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.240
Bzz, bzz, bzz.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.800
Tss, tss, tss.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.000
HE COUGHS

19:36.000 --> 19:39.040
LAUGHTER

19:39.040 --> 19:42.040
I think everybody would be more
comfortable if you weren't here.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.560
It's a pity everybody
doesn't pay the buckin' rent!

19:44.560 --> 19:49.320
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

19:49.320 --> 19:52.520
All right Mammy,
but please...don't interfere.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.960
Fly, wall, me.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.120
Bz.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.120
OK then, let's begin...

19:59.120 --> 20:00.200
Badges!

20:01.400 --> 20:03.960
You never gave us our badges!

20:03.960 --> 20:05.000
Badges?

20:05.000 --> 20:06.560
We're all meant to have badges.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.920
You know, "My name is Agnes
Brown. I'm a lunatic!"

20:08.920 --> 20:10.680
LAUGHTER

20:10.680 --> 20:13.040
No, Mammy. You don't get badges.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.720
You're meant to get badges.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.840
You don't, Mammy,
and that's the end of it!

20:16.840 --> 20:18.760
Fine... you forgot the badges.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.760
Maria, what do you...

20:22.760 --> 20:24.920
I have stickers upstairs!

20:24.920 --> 20:27.720
We could use stickers and a marker
and write the names on.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.760
Mammy, please!

20:28.760 --> 20:32.040
I'm only trying to
help you out of your badge situation.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.080
I DON'T HAVE A BADGE SITUATION!

20:34.080 --> 20:37.120
Well, obviously, because you
don't have fuckin' badges!

20:37.120 --> 20:40.160
I did not forget the badges,
we're just not having badges.

20:40.160 --> 20:44.120
Badges would be pointless
in this situation,
because we don't need them!

20:45.200 --> 20:47.960
LAUGHTER

20:47.960 --> 20:49.360
Cathy, calm down...

20:50.720 --> 20:52.760
..you're making something
out of nothing!

20:52.760 --> 20:55.360
Dermot, you don't need a badge.
Maria, need a badge?

20:55.360 --> 20:58.040
No, I don't need a badge.
Fuck the badges!

20:58.040 --> 20:59.480
LAUGHTER

21:00.480 --> 21:01.600
Maria...

21:02.920 --> 21:05.160
what do you think
started all of this? Well...

21:05.160 --> 21:07.960
Miss! Miss!
Mammy, is this you not interfering?

21:07.960 --> 21:11.280
No, it's Sooty in his nude!

21:12.440 --> 21:17.400
I just want to say this is Dermot's
home. Dermot should go first.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.880
Mammy, it doesn't matter who goes
first. Then start with Dermot.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.120
No, Mammy, I will not
start with Dermot.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.840
Now, if you don't mind,
there's a system for doing this.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.960
Is there? Yeah! Well, how come
it doesn't matter who goes first?

21:28.960 --> 21:33.440
I beg your pardon? You can't
have "system" and "doesn't matter"
in the same feckin' sentence.

21:33.440 --> 21:36.080
Imagine if that was the
system for landing airplanes?

21:36.080 --> 21:38.560
And the pilot coming in to land says,

21:38.560 --> 21:40.800
"Excuse me captain...captain...

21:40.800 --> 21:43.440
"whatever your name is,
cos we've no fuckin' badges."

21:43.440 --> 21:45.440
LAUGHTER

21:45.440 --> 21:47.360
"Are the wheels down?

21:47.360 --> 21:49.440
"Oh, it doesn't matter!"

21:50.760 --> 21:51.920
BOOF!

21:53.240 --> 21:57.560
That wouldn't that be a nice way
for the Hoolihans to start their
two weeks in Fuengerola!

21:57.560 --> 21:59.480
Do you know what, Mammy? What?

21:59.480 --> 22:02.040
You do this every time.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.480
Ah, don't exaggerate, I never
flew an airplane in me buckin' life.

22:06.920 --> 22:10.000
You mess everything up when
I try to do my own thing!

22:10.000 --> 22:12.640
You're getting paranoid. Am I? Yes!

22:12.640 --> 22:14.640
Well, what about Teddy Brannigan?

22:16.760 --> 22:18.360
Teddy Brannigan?

22:19.360 --> 22:23.080
That was a long time ago.
Yes, it was, but you still
remember it, don't you?

22:23.080 --> 22:24.800
Oh, I remember, all right.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.760
LAUGHTER

22:28.760 --> 22:30.560
You were sixteen years of age!

22:30.560 --> 22:32.720
Not a titty to your name.

22:32.720 --> 22:36.960
I was going to get you glasses so
people would know which way you were
facing!

22:41.880 --> 22:45.480
The neighbours used to say,
"Here comes Cathy Brown
with the two backs".

22:47.720 --> 22:51.680
Teddy Brannigan used to go up and
down our road at two o'clock in the
morning,

22:51.680 --> 22:53.760
"Neeeeow, neeeeeow, brrm."

22:53.760 --> 22:55.760
If he got a motorbike,
he'd be dangerous!

22:58.280 --> 23:02.680
And you, running behind
him with your helmet on you!

23:02.680 --> 23:04.640
I was in love!

23:04.640 --> 23:07.640
Love, my arse! What would you know
about love at sixteen?

23:07.640 --> 23:09.560
Especially to a thug like that.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.120
Oh, Mammy, if you had your way,
I'd never get a man!

23:12.120 --> 23:14.200
It'd help if you'd
stop electrocuting 'em!

23:16.640 --> 23:18.720
I saved you!

23:20.160 --> 23:22.960
You saved me?
Don't try and thank me now!

23:22.960 --> 23:25.880
I'm not thanking you. I don't know
what you're talking about!

23:25.880 --> 23:29.360
You wouldn't have been happy!
Well, I'm not happy now, so there!

23:29.360 --> 23:31.800
You should talk to yourself
and leave them alone!

23:31.800 --> 23:34.120
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ,
yourself!

23:34.120 --> 23:36.640
You won't even let me...

23:36.640 --> 23:38.720
THEY ARGUE

23:38.720 --> 23:40.560
LOOK!

23:40.560 --> 23:43.440
This is a waste of time! Is it?

23:43.440 --> 23:45.760
Mammy, it's not just
Teddy Brannigan, is it?

23:45.760 --> 23:48.400
No man I ever meet will be
good enough for you, will they?

23:48.400 --> 23:51.040
Where did I leave my violin?

23:51.040 --> 23:54.160
I'm going to me room.
Go to your room... Oh, Jesus!

23:54.160 --> 23:55.480
How could you do that?

23:56.800 --> 23:59.000
How could you beat your mother?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.320
I brushed off you!

24:01.320 --> 24:03.120
You beat me! Oh, my Jesus...

24:03.120 --> 24:04.640
It's gone dead!

24:07.160 --> 24:10.280
It's gone dead, look, it's
feckin' dead! Look it's feckin'...

24:10.280 --> 24:12.720
Oh, Cathy, I can't turn left!

24:12.720 --> 24:14.680
It's spreading... Oh!

24:16.200 --> 24:18.640
LAUGHTER

24:28.560 --> 24:31.400
Jesus Christ, I've gone blind!

24:36.080 --> 24:39.880
Cathy! I'm going! Is she still there?

24:39.880 --> 24:41.760
This is ridiculous!

24:43.160 --> 24:46.160
Cathy! Cathy, wait!
Cathy, please...

24:46.160 --> 24:47.440
Cathy, let me explain!

24:47.440 --> 24:48.480
Cathy...

24:49.840 --> 24:50.880
Cath...

24:51.960 --> 24:54.080
Don't bring me up
them feckin' stairs!

24:55.840 --> 24:58.880
You saw that, now. I was minding
my own business

24:58.880 --> 25:01.120
and she feckin' attacked me!

25:01.120 --> 25:03.360
This is because she
forgot the feckin' badges.

25:05.520 --> 25:09.560
I tell you now,
if Jesus Christ appears to me and
asks me to sacrifice a child...

25:09.560 --> 25:11.320
she's fuckin' gone!

25:16.880 --> 25:19.200
Well, I feel much better after that.

25:20.880 --> 25:21.920
So do I.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.400
I'm so sorry, Maria.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.840
No, Dermot, look I'm sorry.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.400
I shouldn't have made a big deal
about us moving in.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.200
Yes, you should!

25:31.200 --> 25:32.480
You were right, Maria.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.360
You mean you want us
to live together?

25:35.360 --> 25:37.520
On one condition. What?

25:42.080 --> 25:45.400
Will you marry me, Maria?
Oh, yeah I will.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.600
Right!

25:50.040 --> 25:53.000
Let's go down to Foley's
and tell everyone! Haha!

26:03.840 --> 26:08.360
I thought that went well.
Yeah, Mammy, it did,
it was a great idea. Thanks, love.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.440
I'll get you a cup of tea.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.600
BANGING

26:12.600 --> 26:15.640
I swear that man thinks
I'm on a feckin' bungee rope!

26:18.200 --> 26:19.560
What do you want now?

26:19.560 --> 26:21.280
'I think I'm dying!'

26:21.280 --> 26:23.800
Yeah? Well,
call me when you're sure.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.080
Go up and see what's wrong with
him will you, Cathy?

26:28.080 --> 26:31.400
Tell him if he doesn't behave, I'll
come and take his temperature!

26:31.400 --> 26:32.600
Cathy!

26:36.120 --> 26:38.320
Here, love, that's for you.

26:38.320 --> 26:39.920
What's this?

26:39.920 --> 26:41.880
Encyclopaedia Britannica.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.800
It's a phone number.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.600
Yes, it's Teddy Brannigan's
phone number.

26:51.120 --> 26:54.640
You know I don't like gossip, but
I was down at me yoga classes and...

26:57.160 --> 26:59.560
..I was levitating
beside Mary Matthews and...

26:59.560 --> 27:01.720
she was talking
about Teddy Brannigan.

27:01.720 --> 27:05.160
His wife shagged off on him,
left him with two young kids,
two years ago.

27:06.960 --> 27:10.680
It's not easy on your own with young
children, and I know that. And I...

27:10.680 --> 27:12.800
I thought a phone call
might cheer him up.

27:12.800 --> 27:15.120
You know you get a phone call
sometimes, "Hello?

27:15.120 --> 27:16.920
"Oh, Jesus I'm cheered up!"

27:18.840 --> 27:21.200
Anyway that's his number...

27:24.560 --> 27:26.840
Thank you, Mammy. You're welcome!

27:29.480 --> 27:30.960
I mean it, Mammy.

27:33.240 --> 27:34.280
Really.

27:35.640 --> 27:36.840
Thank you.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.320
I know you do.

27:41.240 --> 27:43.280
That...that's what we do, love...

27:43.280 --> 27:45.320
mothers...

27:45.320 --> 27:46.760
that's what we feckin' do.

27:55.320 --> 27:59.440
That's it, I suppose, you know. I'm
not a cleaner, or a businesswoman.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.240
I'm a mother.

28:03.680 --> 28:06.040
And, and that's what we do. That!

28:08.920 --> 28:11.280
He's still a buckin' thug!

28:13.960 --> 28:15.400
Who are you talking to, Mammy?

28:16.440 --> 28:19.920
Nobody. Just meself, you know.
Nobody important.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.000
Goodnight.

28:26.000 --> 28:33.040
# Say hello to
the Queen of Dublin Town

28:33.040 --> 28:35.840
# As the best mum of all

28:35.840 --> 28:38.600
# She wears a crown

28:38.600 --> 28:41.200
# Mother hen watching over chicks

28:41.200 --> 28:45.240
# A sassy old lady full of tricks

28:45.240 --> 28:50.760
# It's a safe bet she'd never let
life get her down

28:50.760 --> 28:53.960
# She's Mrs Brown

28:53.960 --> 28:57.480
# That's Mrs Brown... #
