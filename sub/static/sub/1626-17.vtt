Oh, my god, max!
I'm so happy for you!

20:12.845 --> 20:15.646
Even though I thought I'd be
the first one to get engaged.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.549
I think we all thought that.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.551
Deke, I don't know
what you're gonna

20:20.553 --> 20:22.587
Pull out of your pocket,
but it better be a gun.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.822
Actually, I know you don't
want a ring-ring.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.925
But how about a nuvaring?

20:27.927 --> 20:30.027
A nuvaring?

20:30.029 --> 20:32.597
How did you know my size?

20:32.599 --> 20:34.599
I can't wait to try it on.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.602
Well, I am not throwing you
a shower for that.

20:37.604 --> 20:42.607
After I saw how you maybe forgot
to take your pill on day one

20:42.609 --> 20:45.610
And then took pills all day
just to be safe,

20:45.612 --> 20:47.411
I thought you'd need
a little help.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.047
So there, max. Will you not
have children with me?

20:50.049 --> 20:52.950
You're damn right I won't.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.586
Oh, wait, I think these
take a couple days to work.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.622
Where are we gonna
get a condom for tonight?
