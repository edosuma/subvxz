00:56.141 --> 00:57.225
<i>At the end
of high school,</i>

00:57.308 --> 01:00.729
<i>I fell in love with
a substitute English teacher.</i>

01:00.812 --> 01:02.856
<i>It was quite a scandal.</i>

01:02.939 --> 01:06.109
Corin didn't start
out a bad guy, though.

01:06.192 --> 01:09.487
We were together about 10 years
and we had two kids.

01:09.612 --> 01:13.241
And then he fell in love
with someone in a Starbucks,

01:13.324 --> 01:16.995
and moved to Palo Alto,
California.

01:17.078 --> 01:21.541
Kind of severed relations
with the three of us.

01:21.624 --> 01:25.754
My parents, if I were defending them,
which I'm not,

01:25.837 --> 01:29.340
had said, back in the day,
that he had an "impatient eye."

01:29.466 --> 01:31.509
They didn't like him.

01:31.634 --> 01:35.805
Week I left,
things escalated.

01:35.889 --> 01:39.434
My parents cursed at me,
which was, like, crazy unusual.

01:41.186 --> 01:44.564
And it ended, one afternoon,
very badly.

01:44.647 --> 01:49.694
I left at 19, haven't spoken
to my parents in 15 years.

01:50.737 --> 01:52.405
Whatever.
That's just the history.

01:54.199 --> 01:58.077
<i>Recently, my parents
looked me up on the Internet.</i>

01:58.161 --> 01:59.788
<i>Asked to meet
their grandchildren.</i>

01:59.871 --> 02:01.748
<i>Spend a week with them.</i>

02:01.873 --> 02:04.834
<i>I looked my parents up,
they have a counseling website.</i>

02:06.294 --> 02:07.462
People love them.

02:07.629 --> 02:11.257
Ironically, they counsel people,
which is a hoot.

02:11.382 --> 02:14.761
Whatever. I told the kids.
They said they wanted to go.

02:14.886 --> 02:16.137
I told them I didn't
want them to go.

02:16.221 --> 02:18.431
They said they were gonna
go anyway.

02:18.556 --> 02:20.642
They're brats.
What can I tell you?

02:21.893 --> 02:25.647
<i>And my 15-year-old wants to
make a documentary about this.</i>

02:25.730 --> 02:27.607
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
Go back.</i>

02:27.690 --> 02:31.945
<i>Um, describe the events on the day
you left your parents' farm at 19.</i>

02:34.405 --> 02:36.282
I did something
I don't choose to tell you.

02:36.366 --> 02:40.954
If they choose to tell you,
that's their right. Okay?

02:41.037 --> 02:43.414
<i>I want to
do this for you.</i>

02:43.498 --> 02:46.042
<i>Listen,
they're good people.</i>

02:46.125 --> 02:47.252
<i>Ask them.</i>

02:48.962 --> 02:51.798
Can I be done with my part?
I still got to get you guys packed.

02:58.263 --> 03:01.641
I'm on the text
with two separate girls.

03:01.766 --> 03:03.434
It's important
you put the word "separate" in there,

03:03.518 --> 03:05.520
in case we thought
they were conjoined twins.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.188
Explain "on the text"?

03:07.272 --> 03:08.773
In communication,
nothing more.

03:08.857 --> 03:10.525
No, they're on deck.

03:10.608 --> 03:12.944
You are 13!
There's no deck to be on.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.196
I've seen him in the shower.
That's eerily accurate.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.656
You don't even
have boobs!

03:16.781 --> 03:19.200
Hey, stop, both of you!

03:19.284 --> 03:20.827
I need to text.

03:20.910 --> 03:22.453
It's one week.

03:22.537 --> 03:24.122
Your phones won't work
all the way out there.

03:24.205 --> 03:25.540
You'll be home Saturday.

03:25.623 --> 03:27.263
Are you holding
my camera properly?

03:27.333 --> 03:29.627
Swerve, girl. Okay?

03:32.171 --> 03:33.381
Oh.

04:16.466 --> 04:18.051
Our mother,
Loretta Jamison,

04:18.134 --> 04:20.928
is dating an eligible
and rather rakish-looking man

04:21.012 --> 04:23.514
named Miguel Diego Torres.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.099
He's in love with her.

04:25.183 --> 04:28.645
We've decided to promote
this union by giving them time.

04:28.770 --> 04:30.855
They're going on a trip.
Mmm-hmm.

04:30.939 --> 04:32.857
A Royal Caribbean cruise.

04:32.941 --> 04:34.943
Your basic beach cruise.

04:35.026 --> 04:38.279
We're visiting our grandparents,
whom we have never seen.

04:38.363 --> 04:41.199
We don't know their
temperament or their proclivities.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.575
Yeah.

04:42.659 --> 04:44.911
And, we don't even
know what they like.

04:45.036 --> 04:49.123
They, they could be
scrapbookers.

04:49.207 --> 04:51.459
They could think
boy bands are cute.

04:52.377 --> 04:53.378
Ticket?

04:53.878 --> 04:55.421
Two for Masonville, PA.

04:55.505 --> 04:57.423
Our grandparents are meeting us.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.759
You a film prodigy?

04:59.842 --> 05:01.803
You know, I used to be
a pretty good actor.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.366
Oh, my camera
light's blinking.

05:03.429 --> 05:06.015
"I am disgraced,
impeached and baffled here."

05:06.099 --> 05:07.179
Battery pack is low.

05:07.225 --> 05:08.977
"Pierced to the soul
with slander's venomed spear."

05:09.060 --> 05:12.563
Oh, oh, unfortunately,
I'm just going to have to shut the camera off.

05:20.279 --> 05:24.742
Since our father left, my brother's
had a preoccupation with germs.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.661
The psychologist
we saw for a month

05:26.744 --> 05:29.414
said it was his way
of controlling things.

05:33.418 --> 05:36.629
<i>Girl, I'm chilling again
I'm feeling again</i>

05:36.713 --> 05:39.507
<i>I'm like Iron Man and Batman
I'm a hero again</i>

05:39.590 --> 05:41.426
<i>Oh, you think I'm little
but last month</i>

05:41.509 --> 05:43.344
<i>I grew an inch
and a quarter again</i>

05:43.428 --> 05:46.139
<i>You think you're too good for me
But that's really a joke</i>

05:46.264 --> 05:47.515
<i>'Cause, see,
that doesn't bother me</i>

05:47.598 --> 05:49.183
<i>'Cause I'm not
a sensitive bloke</i>

05:49.267 --> 05:53.104
<i>Oh, now, in the end,
you'll be in my bed
We won't be just friends</i>

05:53.229 --> 05:56.024
<i>You'll write inappropriate texts
And hit "Send"</i>

05:56.107 --> 05:58.693
<i>We share
a Starbucks Frappuccino blend</i>

05:58.776 --> 06:02.363
<i>And see, this isn't just philosophy
It's based on science, you see</i>

06:02.447 --> 06:04.949
<i>Mr. Singh, my pediatrician
Just confirmed for me</i>

06:05.074 --> 06:08.453
<i>You tall skanks
I'm going through puberty</i>

06:08.619 --> 06:09.620
<i>Ho!</i>

06:09.704 --> 06:11.539
Ooh!
Whoo!

06:11.622 --> 06:13.166
Pound.

06:13.291 --> 06:15.168
Whoa.

06:15.293 --> 06:18.046
Maybe I can rap at the end of
your documentary.

06:18.129 --> 06:21.507
Right, because that's how all
Oscar-winning documentaries end.

06:21.632 --> 06:23.968
With songs of misogyny.

06:27.305 --> 06:29.557
This is where
our mom grew up.

06:29.724 --> 06:32.310
When she left, she thought she was
with the man of her dreams.

06:49.994 --> 06:51.788
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:51.871 --> 06:54.665
- Becca, right? Yeah?
- Oh!

06:54.832 --> 06:56.501
Becca Jamison.

06:58.169 --> 07:00.838
This is Marja Bella Jamison.

07:00.963 --> 07:02.965
Uh, my Nana.

07:03.091 --> 07:04.175
She's a good cook.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.844
And we have the same eyes.

07:08.304 --> 07:10.598
And this is
Fredrick Spencer Jamison.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.558
My Pop Pop.

07:12.642 --> 07:16.562
He's a farmer now,
but they also volunteer as counselors.

07:17.021 --> 07:20.108
How do you feel about
your new grandparents, Tyler?

07:20.191 --> 07:22.193
It's all good.

07:22.276 --> 07:25.238
They don't even know
who One Direction is, so...

07:25.321 --> 07:27.907
Nana, did you
make these pretzels?

07:28.032 --> 07:29.534
Yes, I did.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.204
Thank you so much.

07:47.385 --> 07:49.262
Here we are.

07:53.766 --> 07:56.018
Tyler, look!
It's Mom's tree swing.

07:56.811 --> 07:58.855
Okay, on camera,
tell us what Mom told you.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.022
She used to wait
out here on this

08:00.106 --> 08:02.275
when her friends
would come over.

08:02.358 --> 08:05.570
This is the perfect cinematic
image to open the documentary.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.030
Go near it.

08:10.575 --> 08:12.451
Wait! Wait, don't touch it.

08:12.535 --> 08:15.454
Just let it
organically swing.

08:27.592 --> 08:30.553
We're entering the home
that Mom grew up in.

08:34.765 --> 08:35.808
Look!

08:35.892 --> 08:38.519
Look, there's the clock
that she told us about.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.775
Do you play sports?

08:44.901 --> 08:46.527
I don't like sports.

08:46.611 --> 08:47.987
He used to.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.531
What do you do?

08:50.615 --> 08:52.825
Why are your pants
so low?

08:52.950 --> 08:54.243
I rap.

08:54.410 --> 08:56.662
It's a form of
modern poetry.

08:56.746 --> 08:58.164
If you give him
a topic,

08:58.247 --> 09:00.958
he'll extemporaneously rhyme
on the subject.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.211
His stage nom de plume
is "T-Diamond Stylus."

09:05.421 --> 09:08.216
Go ahead,
Nana, give him anything.

09:08.299 --> 09:10.885
Is food okay?
I like food.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.720
Yeah. Of course.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.223
How about...

09:15.306 --> 09:18.726
Pineapple upside-down cake?

09:18.893 --> 09:20.895
Yeah. Sure,
why not? Okay.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.313
Mmm-hmm.

09:25.316 --> 09:26.442
Okay.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.528
Got it. Okay.

09:32.073 --> 09:33.282
<i>The girls, they like me</i>

09:33.366 --> 09:34.566
<i>They think
I'm sweet like candy</i>

09:34.617 --> 09:37.078
<i>One girl looked at me
Like I was a Hershey bar</i>

09:37.161 --> 09:38.246
<i>Her name was Angie</i>

09:38.329 --> 09:40.873
<i>And a few tall girls
They just looked at me blankly</i>

09:40.957 --> 09:43.167
<i>So here's the thing
You got to understand about me</i>

09:43.292 --> 09:45.920
<i>I got more rhymes
Than a beehive has bees</i>

09:46.003 --> 09:48.923
<i>So it didn't surprise, confuse
Or make me say "For heaven's sake"</i>

09:49.006 --> 09:51.050
<i>When a Hawaiian girl
With a balance disorder said</i>

09:51.133 --> 09:54.136
<i>"You remind me of
a pineapple upside-down cake"</i>

09:54.220 --> 09:55.304
<i>Ho!</i>

09:55.888 --> 09:57.056
Whoa!

09:59.600 --> 10:00.810
Yes, sir!

10:00.893 --> 10:02.103
Yeah?

10:06.023 --> 10:07.108
Mom's room.

10:07.191 --> 10:08.818
It's not fancy.

10:10.486 --> 10:11.529
I call the main bed.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.613
No pre-calls!

10:12.697 --> 10:14.115
No, no,
I got here first!

10:14.198 --> 10:15.283
No, no, no!

10:15.366 --> 10:16.909
Rock-paper-scissors?

10:16.993 --> 10:18.286
Okay.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.164
Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot!

10:22.498 --> 10:24.292
Do it again.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.377
Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot!

10:27.962 --> 10:30.631
Have a nice rest all
the way over there.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.260
You guys are good kids.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.137
This is gonna be
a great week.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.820
By the way, there's mold
in the basement.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.890
We don't want you
guys to get sick.

10:39.974 --> 10:42.268
I got, like, no bars!

10:43.352 --> 10:44.687
None!

10:45.730 --> 10:46.810
Just keep unpacking.

10:46.856 --> 10:48.816
No, don't look at the camera.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.693
There we go.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.031
This is so beautiful.

10:55.114 --> 10:56.198
Stop looking at the cam...

10:56.282 --> 10:59.410
Just unpack like you normally would.
But I'm not here, okay?

10:59.535 --> 11:03.289
Just be... Be natural.

11:05.207 --> 11:06.876
Is this natural enough?

11:06.959 --> 11:08.627
You're such an idiot.

11:14.383 --> 11:18.137
These are the people
in Nana and Pop Pop's life.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.059
I have to
burn them a little.

11:24.268 --> 11:27.063
Not too much.
Just a skosh.

11:38.783 --> 11:40.618
<i>So, where are they now?</i>

11:40.701 --> 11:42.370
Outside,
by the chicken coops.

11:42.453 --> 11:43.496
<i>How are they?</i>

11:43.621 --> 11:45.206
<i>Don't answer that,
I don't care.</i>

11:45.289 --> 11:47.541
<i>Are they being nice? Have they said
anything nasty about me?</i>

11:47.625 --> 11:49.210
<i>Don't answer that.</i>

11:49.418 --> 11:51.504
<i>Ah! This is like
a divorce settlement.</i>

11:51.629 --> 11:54.882
<i>They get you for one week
every 15 years, and we try to be civil.</i>

11:54.965 --> 11:57.676
Mom, we talked about this.

11:57.802 --> 11:59.011
We made a decision.

11:59.095 --> 12:01.430
You go.
We're having a great time.

12:01.514 --> 12:03.224
Yeah. You should
go, okay?

12:03.307 --> 12:05.643
You won't be so grumpy
when you get back.

12:09.647 --> 12:12.691
<i>Jacques Cousteau over here
wants to go buy swimsuits.</i>

12:12.817 --> 12:14.485
We're headed for the dock in a few hours!
There you go!

12:14.568 --> 12:16.320
Hey, Miguel.
<i>Morning.</i>

12:18.155 --> 12:20.741
<i>I can't believe
I'm doing this!</i>

12:20.825 --> 12:22.785
<i>A Walmart sales
associate's gonna be</i>

12:22.868 --> 12:25.287
<i>on the world's
largest cruise ship!</i>

12:27.248 --> 12:29.708
<i>I hate you
spoiled brats.</i>

12:29.792 --> 12:32.002
We hate you, too.
We hate you, too.

12:33.129 --> 12:35.214
We're looking
for visual tension.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.590
Things that pull the frame,

12:36.674 --> 12:40.010
things that force us to imagine
what is beyond the frame.

12:40.845 --> 12:43.597
Record only what is happening
to you as a participant,

12:43.681 --> 12:45.474
and we'll discuss
what <i>"mise-en-scène"</i> is tomorrow.

12:45.558 --> 12:49.186
So, I'm, like,
co-director now?

12:49.311 --> 12:51.981
"B Camera Operator"
will be your official title.

12:53.691 --> 12:58.195
This is the first camera that Mom
found in the damaged goods bin.

13:00.322 --> 13:04.034
Just try to be formal, as in classicism.
Moments that are...

13:14.628 --> 13:16.213
Hi, Pop Pop!

13:31.896 --> 13:33.397
Hi, Pop Pop.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.697
Pop Pop!

13:44.992 --> 13:47.077
What's in the shed, Becca?

13:57.379 --> 13:59.006
Okay.

13:59.089 --> 14:01.342
I've decided to use
female pop singers' names

14:01.425 --> 14:03.469
instead of cursing,
from now on.

14:04.762 --> 14:06.096
Why?

14:06.180 --> 14:07.973
I think it would
sound better.

14:08.057 --> 14:11.727
Like, if I stubbed my toe,
I'd say "Ah, Shakira!"

14:13.103 --> 14:15.439
Ah, you're strange.

14:16.524 --> 14:18.400
Is everything okay?

14:18.484 --> 14:20.069
Yeah. We're great, Pop Pop.

14:20.152 --> 14:23.948
I have not seen your Nana
this happy in years.

14:24.073 --> 14:28.702
Becca, T-Diamond Stylus,
we're old people.

14:28.827 --> 14:32.706
Bedtime here
is 9:30. Yeah.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.125
See you in the morning.

14:38.087 --> 14:40.548
9:30?
9:30.

14:40.631 --> 14:43.133
Oh, God.
9:30.

14:43.217 --> 14:44.760
This is gonna be fun.

14:44.843 --> 14:47.221
No Wi-Fi at 9:30.

14:49.348 --> 14:53.686
I want more cookies.
She was right about the burnt walnuts.

14:54.395 --> 14:56.772
So, go get some.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.483
Well, it's past 9:30.
I don't want to wake them.

14:59.608 --> 15:03.112
Oh, just be quiet.
They're old, they won't hear anything.

15:03.988 --> 15:07.032
<i>I've wanted to spend time
with you for so long, Nana.</i>

15:10.077 --> 15:12.413
Seriously,
that makes me want to cry.

15:12.538 --> 15:14.331
<i>You can teach me
all of your cooking secrets.</i>

15:14.456 --> 15:17.293
Are you consciously aware
that that's my intention?

15:17.376 --> 15:19.461
I hate sappy movies.
I find them torturous.

15:19.545 --> 15:20.879
<i>That smells so good, Nana.</i>

15:20.963 --> 15:22.798
I think
it looks good.

15:27.011 --> 15:29.930
I've decided to use
Mom's favorite musical soundtrack.

15:30.014 --> 15:33.309
It's so over the top,
it'll be her presence in the documentary.

15:33.434 --> 15:35.477
Counter-point to
the quiet drama.

15:37.229 --> 15:39.648
This'll be ironic scoring.

15:39.732 --> 15:41.442
You're gonna be alone
your whole life, aren't you?

15:41.525 --> 15:45.404
Yeah, like Miss Porter,
the gym teacher.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.781
Oh, and, um...

15:47.906 --> 15:50.618
By the way,
how is this helpful?

15:50.701 --> 15:52.661
Oh, snap!

15:53.621 --> 15:56.749
That's a little
candy for the ladies.

16:07.635 --> 16:08.886
I can't sleep.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.512
I need Nana's cookies.

16:10.596 --> 16:11.956
I'm gonna turn
a personal addiction

16:12.014 --> 16:14.350
into a positive
cinematic moment.

16:34.662 --> 16:36.580
Mom, I'm retracing the steps

16:36.664 --> 16:37.790
of how you might
have snuck out

16:37.873 --> 16:39.667
of your room and
stolen Nana's cookies.

16:59.937 --> 17:01.188
Tyler?

17:02.439 --> 17:03.982
Tyler, wake up.

17:06.777 --> 17:09.445
T-Diamond, Nana's sick.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.830
<i>And that's the camera.</i>

17:21.916 --> 17:25.378
So, then you put
the videos on the Internet.

17:25.462 --> 17:28.298
So I have four
freestyle videos.

17:28.382 --> 17:31.343
One of them has 347 hits.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.763
You're both so talented.

17:34.847 --> 17:36.849
Do you know who Tyler,
The Creator is?

17:37.015 --> 17:38.142
No.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.894
Well, I got that
kind of sound.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.771
Mmm.
People say.

17:42.855 --> 17:45.524
Come, Becca, darling. Eat.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.571
Pop Pop.

17:56.285 --> 17:57.619
Pop Pop?

18:04.001 --> 18:05.419
You need me?

18:08.297 --> 18:10.716
Your grandmother's fine.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.886
She had a little bit of
a stomach flu last night.

18:16.930 --> 18:20.142
Must have been
a 24-hour thing.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.352
I knew it was
something like that.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.232
She's an old lady, Becca.

18:28.442 --> 18:30.569
She gets sick sometimes.

18:30.694 --> 18:32.362
Yeah, of course.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.199
Tyler!

18:37.868 --> 18:40.078
Pop Pop said he'd take us
into town this afternoon

18:40.204 --> 18:43.123
to shoot some of
Mom's old hangouts.

18:43.248 --> 18:44.792
Tyler?

18:49.880 --> 18:51.465
You can play
hide-and-seek down here.

18:51.632 --> 18:54.551
There's, um... There's
lots of visual tension.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.303
Mom's hide-and-seek place.

18:59.765 --> 19:03.352
You better hide,
my ethnically confused friend.

19:03.435 --> 19:05.020
One Mississippi.

19:05.813 --> 19:07.731
Two Mississippi.

19:07.898 --> 19:09.775
Three Mississippi.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.069
Four Mississippi.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.446
Five Mississippi!

19:14.530 --> 19:16.907
Ready or not,
here I come!

19:25.249 --> 19:27.584
I see you,
you little pudge.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.765
I'll have to
use strategy.

19:41.849 --> 19:45.477
He's faster, but I'm smarter by
at least two standard deviations.

19:47.437 --> 19:48.814
Here I come!

19:55.445 --> 19:57.906
Right past me.

20:14.673 --> 20:15.883
Becca?

20:19.803 --> 20:21.013
Becca?

20:24.641 --> 20:26.801
Here I come, Tyler!
Here I come!

20:33.650 --> 20:34.735
Tyler?

20:34.985 --> 20:35.986
Tyler!

20:49.124 --> 20:52.127
I'm gonna get you!

20:52.920 --> 20:55.255
I'm coming
to get you, Becca!

21:20.447 --> 21:22.366
I'm making chicken pot pie.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.377
What the hell was that?

21:45.430 --> 21:46.765
Can I help you?

21:46.890 --> 21:48.642
Hi, I'm Doctor Sam.

21:48.725 --> 21:51.103
I work at the hospital
where your grandparents counsel.

21:51.228 --> 21:53.730
You must be Becca.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.691
Are you making a movie?

21:55.774 --> 21:58.485
I used to be an actor
back in my day.

21:58.568 --> 22:00.028
"Life's but a walking shadow,

22:00.112 --> 22:02.447
"a poor player that struts
and frets his hour..."

22:02.531 --> 22:04.241
Did you want to talk
to Nana and Pop Pop?

22:04.366 --> 22:06.243
Yes. Are they around?

22:06.410 --> 22:09.830
No, they're taking a walk, I think.
You just missed them.

22:10.580 --> 22:15.335
Okay. Well, tell them
I stopped by.

22:15.419 --> 22:18.547
They were supposed to
volunteer a few days ago.

22:18.630 --> 22:19.715
I tried calling.

22:19.798 --> 22:22.843
I just wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

22:22.926 --> 22:26.388
I think the volunteer stuff
is getting too stressful for them,

22:26.471 --> 22:27.973
although they
won't admit it.

22:28.056 --> 22:30.225
Oh, they're fine.

22:30.308 --> 22:32.227
Well, glad to hear it.

22:33.228 --> 22:36.857
Tell them there's a lot of
excitement down at the hospital.

22:36.940 --> 22:39.359
I can't wait to tell them.
I know they love gossip.

22:39.443 --> 22:42.195
I'll tell them.
Nice to meet you.

22:44.656 --> 22:47.200
12:15 p.m. Tuesday.

22:47.284 --> 22:50.579
Tyler Jamison, known to most ladies
as T-Diamond Stylus,

22:50.662 --> 22:52.998
investigates
what is in the shed.

22:53.707 --> 22:57.586
This is an isolated farm.
People sneaking around.

23:00.130 --> 23:01.798
Is it dead bodies?

23:03.633 --> 23:05.469
Is it dead bodies?

23:07.971 --> 23:09.306
Is it dead bodies?

23:42.714 --> 23:44.341
I'm gonna go to the shed.

23:56.478 --> 23:57.813
Ugh!

23:58.688 --> 24:00.774
Smells like ass in here.

24:12.285 --> 24:13.370
Um...

24:14.746 --> 24:17.707
I'm moving closer
to the suspicious pile.

24:28.844 --> 24:30.679
Ugh, shit!

24:34.808 --> 24:36.601
Ah, God damn it!

24:39.563 --> 24:41.731
Ugh, Sarah McLachlan!

24:43.441 --> 24:45.360
Tyler.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.070
What the hell, Nana?

24:49.239 --> 24:52.784
Your Pop Pop
has incontinence.

24:52.868 --> 24:54.786
He hides his
accidents in the shed,

24:54.870 --> 24:58.748
and then I think
he burns them out in the field.

24:59.749 --> 25:03.253
He's such a physical man,
he gets ashamed.

25:05.255 --> 25:08.842
You must be disappointed
in your grandparents.

25:08.925 --> 25:11.845
I'm sorry
we ruined things.

25:11.928 --> 25:13.763
We're really trying.

25:15.932 --> 25:18.101
I'll make you
some bread pudding.

25:20.437 --> 25:22.063
Are we okay?

25:25.275 --> 25:27.569
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm good, Nana.

25:29.196 --> 25:30.280
Good.

25:31.406 --> 25:34.242
My mom's a classic
narrative character.

25:34.326 --> 25:36.870
She says things like,
"Things don't work out for me,"

25:36.953 --> 25:38.788
and then makes it happen.

25:38.955 --> 25:43.877
She needs the elixir, or all of
her relationships will fall apart.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.503
Becca.

25:46.379 --> 25:50.008
Pop Pop, we play this game
where you have to point to a building,

25:50.133 --> 25:53.720
and you have to say who lives there
and what they secretly do.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.305
Becca, do that
police station.

25:57.474 --> 26:00.560
A police officer
named Jerry works there,

26:00.644 --> 26:04.356
but he never comes in to work,
he never answers the phone,

26:04.481 --> 26:07.859
because all he really wants to do
is be a Latin dancer.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.321
Ooh, okay, I'll go.

26:11.446 --> 26:14.699
That huge brick building back there
is a sneaker factory,

26:14.783 --> 26:15.992
and a woman named
Sally works there.

26:16.076 --> 26:18.787
Oh, that's
Maple Shade, actually.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.830
Yeah, Mom said
you guys volunteer there.

26:20.914 --> 26:23.250
Yeah, every
Tuesday and Thursday.

26:23.333 --> 26:27.128
They're good people,
just nobody there to take care of them.

26:28.171 --> 26:31.049
I have to find my Maple Shade badge
and we'll visit.

26:35.595 --> 26:39.432
Join us on a journey
into young Loretta Jamison's past.

26:39.516 --> 26:42.102
This was young
Loretta's high school.

26:42.185 --> 26:45.981
Young Loretta and her friends
used to hang out at this sign.

26:47.274 --> 26:48.942
We will now go
around to the back,

26:49.025 --> 26:50.777
to catch
a glimpse of young,

26:50.860 --> 26:53.280
mischievous Loretta's locker
through a window.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.949
Pop Pop,
was Mom a good student?

26:56.032 --> 26:59.536
We have to go.
That fellow keeps staring at us.

27:00.537 --> 27:02.122
He's not, Pop Pop.

27:02.205 --> 27:04.249
Damn it,
he keeps stopping.

27:04.374 --> 27:06.209
Pop Pop?
Pretending like he's not watching.

27:06.334 --> 27:09.045
What are you doing?
Pop Pop, stop!
Hey.

27:09.212 --> 27:11.464
Hey! Stop following me.

27:11.548 --> 27:13.091
- He's following me!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:13.216 --> 27:14.634
I'm not following you, man!
I don't know you!

27:14.718 --> 27:17.387
Stop following me!
You cross-eyed bastard!

27:17.512 --> 27:19.389
Pop Pop!
You're hurting him!

27:19.472 --> 27:20.557
Get off me!

27:20.724 --> 27:22.142
Hey.

27:22.225 --> 27:23.310
What's your problem?

27:23.393 --> 27:25.395
Tyler...

27:25.520 --> 27:28.106
He doesn't
know you, Pop Pop.

27:28.231 --> 27:31.234
Oh, man.
Yeah, my mistake.

27:32.068 --> 27:33.486
I'm fine, I'm...

27:34.237 --> 27:35.822
I'm sorry.

27:37.574 --> 27:39.659
That was crazy!
He's as strong as a wrestler!

27:39.743 --> 27:42.245
He's old.
They get confused.

27:42.329 --> 27:45.332
Don't freak out.
Old people get paranoid.

27:45.415 --> 27:48.585
And he's a country guy.
All he does is chop wood.

27:54.966 --> 27:57.260
<i>Hey, you still
don't want to talk about it?</i>

28:38.885 --> 28:40.387
What is that?

28:42.097 --> 28:44.474
Okay, we think there's
someone outside the door.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.142
It's 10:47.

28:47.477 --> 28:49.104
Open the door, Becca.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.524
No way.

28:52.607 --> 28:55.235
Okay,
keep recording this.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.954
Come on,
let's see what's out there.

29:09.207 --> 29:10.834
No, something's wrong.

29:10.959 --> 29:13.294
I'm opening the door, Becca.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.589
I'm opening
the door now, Becca.

29:16.673 --> 29:18.675
I don't think you should.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.304
Here I go.
I'm gonna open the door.

29:23.388 --> 29:25.890
Open it, then!
Why do you keep talking about it?

29:35.650 --> 29:37.402
Close the door,
close the door!

29:38.236 --> 29:39.362
Ugh!

29:42.031 --> 29:44.075
Jesus, Becca, I'm blind!

29:48.621 --> 29:49.914
Pop Pop?

29:52.709 --> 29:54.335
Pop Pop?

29:54.878 --> 29:59.757
I gotta tell you the truth.
She has a diagnosed disorder.

29:59.841 --> 30:02.177
Apparently, many
elderly people have it.

30:03.261 --> 30:05.722
Why was she
throwing up like that?

30:08.099 --> 30:11.311
Well, sometimes she gets it in
her head that she ate something,

30:11.394 --> 30:13.813
and it's inside her.

30:15.565 --> 30:17.942
And trying to crawl out.

30:18.026 --> 30:21.404
It's called Sundowning.
It's a kind of dementia.

30:21.488 --> 30:23.615
It's triggered by nightfall.

30:23.740 --> 30:25.200
This is real?

30:25.283 --> 30:29.537
It's like somebody talking in their
sleep is how I was explained it.

30:29.621 --> 30:31.421
It's probably best that
we just call it a rule

30:31.498 --> 30:34.626
that you two shouldn't come
out of your room after 9:30 p.m.

30:34.709 --> 30:36.377
Deal?

30:37.253 --> 30:38.838
Is that a deal?

30:38.922 --> 30:40.673
Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.218
I'm sorry about this.

30:43.301 --> 30:45.261
You must not be
happy now.

30:45.386 --> 30:49.766
It's okay, Pop Pop.
I'm okay. We're just here till Saturday.

30:51.518 --> 30:52.769
Are you going somewhere?

30:52.894 --> 30:56.022
Yeah, I've got to catch the
train to go to the costume party.

31:00.818 --> 31:04.030
Pop Pop, I think you're
mixing up something.

31:04.113 --> 31:05.281
Huh?

31:08.535 --> 31:10.995
Oh, man.

31:11.079 --> 31:12.997
Oh, man. What a...

31:13.915 --> 31:15.625
What a bunch of
confused old fools

31:15.708 --> 31:17.293
your grandparents
turned out to be.

31:17.418 --> 31:19.379
That's all right.
It's okay.

31:20.588 --> 31:22.173
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.

31:22.257 --> 31:24.467
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

31:24.551 --> 31:25.552
It's okay.
Right. Yeah.

31:25.635 --> 31:27.303
<i>Good morning,
Cecil B. DeMille.</i>

31:28.137 --> 31:30.974
He was a great director.

31:31.057 --> 31:33.268
I made you
cheddar biscuits, dear.

31:35.728 --> 31:39.274
Was the old coot getting ready for
the costume party again?

31:39.357 --> 31:41.401
Yeah, he was.

31:41.484 --> 31:43.736
He's crazy.

31:43.820 --> 31:47.448
I'm just doing some chores in the barn.
I'll be in in a minute.

31:50.118 --> 31:52.328
Something happened
to your computer.

31:53.580 --> 31:56.291
I spilled some
biscuit batter on it.

31:56.374 --> 31:58.751
I tried to clean it
with cleaner.

31:58.876 --> 32:00.587
I'm sorry.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.008
<i>She's weird
during the day,</i>

32:05.133 --> 32:06.759
and then gets even
weirder at night?

32:06.843 --> 32:08.720
I'm telling you it's okay.

32:08.803 --> 32:10.888
I downloaded the definition
of "Sundowning."

32:11.014 --> 32:12.265
You wouldn't
understand half the words

32:12.348 --> 32:14.267
I'm reading.
The word "YOLO" isn't in it.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.269
It's got to do with
neurological reactions

32:16.352 --> 32:17.937
to sunshine and moonlight.

32:18.021 --> 32:20.523
It's literally
a chemical reaction.

32:20.648 --> 32:24.068
"Sundown Syndrome: a term
for disorientation, agitation,

32:24.152 --> 32:25.862
"a general worsening
of mental symptoms,

32:25.945 --> 32:28.948
"classically described
in the elderly at dusk or nightfall."

32:29.032 --> 32:32.118
It's normal
old-age problems.

32:32.201 --> 32:34.078
People are scared
of old people for no reason.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.622
What about the computer?

32:35.705 --> 32:37.707
The only thing messed up
is the computer camera.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.292
There's something else
going on.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.127
She used oven cleaner,

32:41.210 --> 32:44.672
and now the tiny camera
on the screen doesn't see anything.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.799
You don't find
that odd at all?

32:46.883 --> 32:48.217
She made a mistake.

32:48.301 --> 32:51.721
Just come to accept they're old people
and things won't be as weird.

32:53.306 --> 32:54.466
<i>We're on the upper deck.</i>

32:54.515 --> 32:57.143
<i>Miguel has entered
a hairy chest competition.</i>

32:57.226 --> 32:58.895
<i>He's getting oiled.</i>

33:01.230 --> 33:03.608
<i>It's so weird
I can't see you.</i>

33:04.025 --> 33:06.152
I think
I can clean it off.

33:06.235 --> 33:08.071
<i>Tyler, why are you quiet?</i>

33:10.865 --> 33:13.701
Nana and Pop Pop
are acting strange. Ow!

33:14.035 --> 33:17.455
<i>What kind of strange?
Becca, did you hit Tyler?</i>

33:17.580 --> 33:18.915
No.

33:19.916 --> 33:21.334
<i>Kids?</i>

33:24.087 --> 33:26.255
Pop Pop wears diapers
and he keeps them in an outhouse,

33:26.339 --> 33:27.840
and Nana walks around
at night without her clothes,

33:27.924 --> 33:30.927
and Pop Pop thinks
strangers are following him.

33:31.427 --> 33:35.348
<i>I knew we were gonna have this call.
They're old, Tyler.</i>

33:35.431 --> 33:36.974
I've discussed this with him.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.310
<i>Old people have trouble
with their bodies sometimes.</i>

33:39.394 --> 33:42.855
<i>They also aren't very self-aware.
They can get paranoid, too.</i>

33:42.939 --> 33:44.357
<i>Becca, how strange
are they acting?</i>

33:44.440 --> 33:46.526
They haven't been
mean one second.

33:46.609 --> 33:47.985
Nana crawled after us
under the house.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.195
Playing hide-and-seek.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.406
<i>You guys played hide-and-seek
under the house? I used to love that!</i>

33:51.489 --> 33:52.532
Carrie Underwood.

33:52.615 --> 33:54.325
<i>T, just bear with it
for a couple of days.</i>

33:54.409 --> 33:57.078
<i>My parents were strange back then.
Mom was a hippie.</i>

33:57.161 --> 33:59.288
<i>She used to sunbathe in the
back yard without warning back then.</i>

33:59.372 --> 34:00.873
I'm already partially blind.

34:00.957 --> 34:04.544
<i>I used to get so embarrassed.
They're just weird people, honey.</i>

34:04.627 --> 34:06.713
<i>What level of
problem is this?</i>

34:07.797 --> 34:08.965
One.

34:10.132 --> 34:11.342
One.

34:11.426 --> 34:12.427
See?

34:12.510 --> 34:14.344
<i>I miss you guys.</i>

34:14.762 --> 34:16.472
Oh!

34:16.556 --> 34:18.725
<i>The hairy chest competition
is about to begin.</i>

34:18.808 --> 34:21.393
<i>I can hear
the cougars clapping.</i>

34:21.476 --> 34:24.813
<i>I got to go.
I wish I could see your faces clearer.</i>

34:53.634 --> 34:55.178
Hi, honey.

35:01.809 --> 35:03.936
Nana, could I ask you
about Mom?

35:11.778 --> 35:15.782
Maybe you'd be okay
to talk for a minute in an interview?

35:32.423 --> 35:36.135
Would you mind getting
inside the oven to clean it?

35:38.137 --> 35:39.597
I'm sorry?

35:39.680 --> 35:43.100
I'm too big.
I can't reach back there.

35:44.018 --> 35:46.562
The kitchen's
got to be clean.

35:48.898 --> 35:50.566
The oven's off.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.904
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, sure.

36:05.623 --> 36:07.542
Get farther in there.

36:14.924 --> 36:16.843
All the way in.

36:31.232 --> 36:34.694
Okay, I'll star
in your movie.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.950
If you could be any animal,
what would you be?

36:41.617 --> 36:43.578
Is there a right answer?

36:43.661 --> 36:47.123
No, these questions are
intended to get you loosened up.

36:47.331 --> 36:48.666
Oh.

36:51.127 --> 36:53.170
A grizzly bear.

36:54.213 --> 36:56.465
I think we're warm.

36:56.591 --> 37:00.011
Mom told me that you and Pop Pop
were very much in love.

37:00.678 --> 37:02.638
Where did you
first meet Pop Pop?

37:03.848 --> 37:05.808
In a garden.

37:05.892 --> 37:07.935
And what did you
think of him?

37:08.019 --> 37:10.605
Oh, he was handsome.

37:10.688 --> 37:14.609
He has a very
strong personality.

37:14.692 --> 37:16.736
This is great.

37:16.819 --> 37:18.529
We'll come back to that.

37:18.613 --> 37:21.532
Right now,
I want to talk about something else.

37:21.657 --> 37:23.826
I know it happened
a long time ago,

37:23.910 --> 37:26.579
but what happened
on the day Mom left?

37:28.247 --> 37:29.999
She won't tell me.

37:33.794 --> 37:35.546
Did she do something?

37:37.298 --> 37:39.383
Nana? Nana?

37:42.595 --> 37:44.972
Nana, don't answer
that question.

37:51.562 --> 37:54.649
No more questions
about Loretta Jamison.

37:55.942 --> 37:57.151
Maybe I can ask about...

37:57.234 --> 37:59.445
I don't wanna
star in your movie.

38:00.404 --> 38:04.408
Okay. It's Wednesday night.
Three nights left.

38:05.743 --> 38:09.872
T-Diamond Stylus is gonna find out
what exactly is going on.

38:09.956 --> 38:11.707
What are you doing?

38:12.667 --> 38:14.377
I'm putting the camera
out tonight. Okay?

38:14.460 --> 38:16.087
It's like we're living
with a werewolf.

38:16.170 --> 38:17.421
You can't record her.

38:17.505 --> 38:18.589
Swerve.

38:18.673 --> 38:19.882
Look, I know you
won't understand this

38:19.966 --> 38:21.509
because your brain
isn't fully developed yet,

38:21.592 --> 38:23.219
but you can't do this.

38:23.302 --> 38:24.720
Why?

38:25.471 --> 38:27.515
It's exploitative.
I have cinematic standards.

38:27.598 --> 38:31.060
No. No one gives a crap about
cinematic standards, okay?

38:31.143 --> 38:32.853
It's not the 1800s.

38:32.979 --> 38:34.855
Have you seen reality TV?

38:34.939 --> 38:38.067
<i>Housekeepers of Houston</i>
has, like, a billion viewers.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.986
If one of us isn't
participating in the event,

38:40.069 --> 38:41.278
we can't record it.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.738
It's just what's ethical.

38:42.822 --> 38:44.532
No offense to Ryan
Seacrest or whoever

38:44.615 --> 38:45.825
came up with
the <i>Housekeepers of Houston.</i>

38:45.908 --> 38:49.078
You think you're
so great, don't you?

38:56.961 --> 38:59.171
I hope things
don't get weirder.

39:00.464 --> 39:02.299
'Cause I'm at my limit.

39:09.932 --> 39:11.684
Show the clock.
Show the clock.

39:14.562 --> 39:16.897
This is what Pop Pop
was talking about.

39:18.691 --> 39:19.859
The werewolf is real.

39:19.942 --> 39:21.193
Wait!

39:22.111 --> 39:24.280
She's Sundowning.

39:24.363 --> 39:28.868
We're participating in this.
You're not being <i>Housekeepers of Houston.</i>

39:30.828 --> 39:34.957
Wait. If you're gonna open the door,
just open it for a little bit.

40:31.931 --> 40:33.099
She's supposed to do that?

40:33.182 --> 40:35.643
It's just like
someone talking in their sleep.

40:35.726 --> 40:37.895
You used to talk in your sleep
till you were seven.

40:38.020 --> 40:40.856
Dad used to come in
and quiet you down.

41:05.756 --> 41:07.174
Hey, Becca.

41:08.926 --> 41:10.219
Who am I?

41:17.143 --> 41:19.728
T. T.

41:24.900 --> 41:28.988
There's a family of foxes.
You're going to miss it.

41:29.071 --> 41:30.739
- We're coming!
- We're coming!

41:34.577 --> 41:36.036
Just stop.

41:44.211 --> 41:45.963
Why is Nana
staring into the well?

41:46.046 --> 41:49.049
Come on, let's go.
Come on, enough of that.

41:49.133 --> 41:50.634
- I don't know.
- Come on.

41:59.101 --> 42:01.187
<i>Mise-en-scène.</i>

42:01.270 --> 42:04.773
You know,
you're not as dumb as your performance

42:04.857 --> 42:06.192
on standardized tests
would indicate.

42:06.275 --> 42:07.735
Oh. Oh!

42:08.402 --> 42:10.446
I forgot I had
something for you.

42:16.327 --> 42:21.332
When you think of Dad now,
in California, do you still like him?

42:22.499 --> 42:25.002
I don't know.
Stuff happens.

42:25.085 --> 42:27.713
No, but Dad is hilarious.
Dad's funny.

42:27.796 --> 42:31.091
He sent the funny card
of the fat lady on the boardwalk.

42:31.175 --> 42:32.927
Do you remember that?

42:33.010 --> 42:35.137
What do you mean
"stuff happens"?

42:37.640 --> 42:39.183
People leave.

42:40.142 --> 42:43.646
Because they find something
they like better.

42:43.729 --> 42:45.898
So you don't feel bad?

42:47.066 --> 42:48.442
No.

42:50.110 --> 42:52.321
You're not being truthful.

42:53.155 --> 42:56.992
Well, you can believe what you want,
but this is how I feel.

42:58.118 --> 42:59.912
Make me believe you.

43:05.209 --> 43:09.463
So, I'm on the Titans pee wee
football team and it was third down.

43:09.546 --> 43:12.299
It was at the end
and we were leading.

43:12.383 --> 43:14.343
So if we stop them,
we probably win the game.

43:14.510 --> 43:17.137
Give me context.
How old are you?

43:17.221 --> 43:18.973
I'm eight.

43:20.307 --> 43:22.643
So, I'm free safety.

43:22.810 --> 43:24.937
Which means that
I'm supposed to tackle the guy

43:25.020 --> 43:28.274
if he makes it past
the people on the line.

43:28.399 --> 43:29.942
So, their running
back punches the hole... Okay.

43:30.025 --> 43:32.069
Am I supposed to be
following these terms?

43:32.194 --> 43:34.405
Are these phrases supposed
to mean something to me?

43:34.530 --> 43:35.948
Just listen.

43:37.533 --> 43:40.869
So their running back,
who's big, makes it past the line,

43:40.995 --> 43:43.622
and I'm the only one
left to tackle him.

43:43.706 --> 43:44.748
All I got to do
is tackle him,

43:44.832 --> 43:47.251
put my hands around him
and tackle him, but...

43:49.878 --> 43:51.547
I just stand there.

43:52.881 --> 43:56.302
They call it "freezing"
and I could hear everyone yelling.

43:56.385 --> 44:00.347
Coach Daugherty, Dad.
All my teammates, and...

44:01.557 --> 44:03.517
He gets the first down
and runs and runs,

44:03.600 --> 44:07.563
and the other team is celebrating,
and I'm still standing there.

44:11.400 --> 44:12.735
Same place.

44:15.446 --> 44:18.282
Then the assistant coach
came and got me,

44:18.365 --> 44:20.492
and Dad patted me on the shoulder
and then went to the car,

44:20.576 --> 44:24.246
and he never told me
he was angry or anything.

44:26.582 --> 44:28.709
You think Dad didn't
say anything and left

44:28.792 --> 44:31.587
because you didn't tackle another
eight-year-old in a game

44:31.754 --> 44:33.380
five years ago?

44:38.052 --> 44:40.763
When you say it like that,
it sounds stupid.

44:46.727 --> 44:48.354
Why are we here?

44:48.437 --> 44:50.272
She was
staring at something.

44:59.448 --> 45:01.950
So, what did you find?

45:04.244 --> 45:05.412
It's only water.

45:10.918 --> 45:13.253
So, I just
read these in order?

45:16.590 --> 45:18.550
"If you could be any animal,
what would it be?"

45:18.634 --> 45:21.136
I feel like a douche, Becca.
Shut up.

45:21.970 --> 45:23.389
I would be a dolphin.

45:23.472 --> 45:25.516
It's an intuitive and highly
intelligent creature

45:25.599 --> 45:28.477
with great power
and poetry in its movements.

45:29.311 --> 45:30.911
How come you like
the pizza delivery guy,

45:30.979 --> 45:34.149
even though he has
all that ratchet acne?

45:38.320 --> 45:40.030
Please answer the question.

45:44.952 --> 45:46.328
He's kind.

45:47.704 --> 45:49.331
He has kind eyes.

45:52.835 --> 45:56.296
How come you don't look
at yourself in the mirror?

45:56.839 --> 46:00.259
Okay, fine.
What's this now?

46:00.342 --> 46:03.804
Besides when you're editing,
you don't like looking at yourself.

46:03.887 --> 46:05.180
You never look at
yourself in the mirror.

46:05.264 --> 46:07.975
You comb your hair
with your back to the mirror.

46:08.058 --> 46:10.477
And I see you
brush your teeth.

46:10.561 --> 46:12.938
You look down
the whole time.

46:16.650 --> 46:19.570
Your sweater's inside out.
Did you know that?

46:21.196 --> 46:23.574
Did you see that in
the mirror this morning?

46:24.867 --> 46:26.535
Is that correct?

46:31.540 --> 46:34.209
It doesn't feel
so good, does it?

46:36.211 --> 46:39.715
Are you changing
the focal length of the lens?

46:39.840 --> 46:41.717
No, I don't even
know what that is.

46:41.842 --> 46:43.677
Are you zooming?

46:44.511 --> 46:45.762
No.

46:49.892 --> 46:52.769
So do you admit that
you don't look at yourself,

46:52.853 --> 46:55.314
or are you gonna
keep lying?

46:55.397 --> 46:57.900
When do you think
I started doing that?

46:58.609 --> 47:00.152
You know when.

47:02.237 --> 47:05.282
That's not true, asshole.

47:05.407 --> 47:07.743
You think you're worthless.

47:08.202 --> 47:09.578
Admit it.

47:18.462 --> 47:20.923
He gave me
a card when he left.

47:24.051 --> 47:25.594
A card.

47:31.433 --> 47:33.602
Old footage of us as kids.

47:34.978 --> 47:37.314
I was thinking of
using it in the doc.

47:38.815 --> 47:41.735
I refuse to use anything
that has my dad in it.

47:43.445 --> 47:45.155
That would mean
I forgive him.

47:54.248 --> 47:55.457
Nana?

48:00.087 --> 48:01.296
Nana?

48:07.636 --> 48:09.179
Becca's blind.

48:11.265 --> 48:13.433
I know I'm right.

48:13.517 --> 48:15.894
That there is
something going on here.

48:19.147 --> 48:22.442
Maybe there's something
down in the basement.

48:22.526 --> 48:26.280
They don't want us to go down there.
They're throwing shade.

48:26.363 --> 48:27.948
Speak English.

48:28.031 --> 48:30.492
They could be hiding
something down there.

48:30.617 --> 48:33.579
There's mold down there.
That's why they don't want us to go down.

48:33.662 --> 48:35.747
Just stop, okay?

48:35.831 --> 48:38.500
Just let me put
the camera out.

48:42.879 --> 48:46.592
Hi, I'm Stacey. Is
Mr. and Mrs. Jamison around?

48:46.675 --> 48:49.928
No, they just stepped out.
It's just me and my brother here.

48:51.513 --> 48:54.474
Mr. and Mrs. Jamison
were counselors at Meadowbrook.

48:54.641 --> 48:57.227
I was in
the rehab program there.

48:57.311 --> 49:00.647
They used to sit by my bed
when I wasn't in good shape.

49:00.731 --> 49:03.233
All night sometimes.

49:03.317 --> 49:06.194
Anyway, this is
a blueberry cobbler for them.

49:06.320 --> 49:09.531
They were supposed to stop by on
Saturday but they never showed.

49:09.656 --> 49:11.950
I know Mrs. Jamison
hadn't been feeling herself,

49:12.034 --> 49:15.454
so I thought
I'd just stop by and check in on them.

49:15.537 --> 49:18.290
They hear all that
scuttlebutt down at Maple Shade?

49:18.373 --> 49:20.375
Uh, I don't think so.

49:22.169 --> 49:24.338
Stacey, it's okay.
Just be natural.

49:24.421 --> 49:26.715
I'm just getting
portraits of everybody.

49:27.924 --> 49:29.551
Just be natural.

49:30.594 --> 49:32.554
Uh, okay, never mind.

49:54.701 --> 49:55.911
Pop Pop?

50:13.720 --> 50:14.930
Pop Pop?

50:20.143 --> 50:21.645
We're even.

50:25.649 --> 50:27.442
I've been editing
montages with music,

50:27.526 --> 50:29.361
but I need some everyday footage
of our grandparents,

50:29.444 --> 50:32.322
so I've decided to spend
Thursday afternoon following them around.

50:33.949 --> 50:37.035
Hear that?
She's laughing as she's watching TV.

50:37.119 --> 50:39.746
Maybe Mom and her
watch the same shows.

51:01.768 --> 51:03.562
Nana?

51:03.645 --> 51:05.313
Nana, are you okay?

51:07.482 --> 51:09.317
Good afternoon.

51:10.152 --> 51:11.987
I heard you laughing.

51:13.113 --> 51:15.991
I have the deep darkies.

51:25.375 --> 51:26.918
Nana? Nana!

51:27.043 --> 51:29.963
Nana, Nana, Nana, stop!
Nana, stop!

51:36.136 --> 51:38.430
Nana, what's happening?

51:38.513 --> 51:43.852
You have to laugh to keep
the deep darkies in a cave.

51:52.736 --> 51:54.196
Pop Pop?

52:00.202 --> 52:01.411
Pop Pop, I think Nana's...

52:01.536 --> 52:02.871
I was just cleaning it.

52:02.954 --> 52:04.623
What is that?

52:04.706 --> 52:07.375
You want something?

52:07.542 --> 52:10.295
I was just
cleaning it, really.

52:10.378 --> 52:13.507
I think Nana's
not feeling well.

52:17.552 --> 52:20.055
Thank you, Becca.
I'll check on her.

52:26.019 --> 52:27.739
<i>We're putting
the camera out tonight.</i>

52:38.573 --> 52:40.242
What do you think?

52:53.922 --> 52:55.423
<i>Whoo-hoo! Ladies!</i>

52:55.507 --> 52:57.676
<i>That's right.
I'm bad, I'm bad.</i>

52:57.759 --> 53:00.762
She seems like
she's better off without us.

53:00.929 --> 53:03.098
We're doing this
so Mom can have a life, dummy.

53:04.850 --> 53:07.102
<i>- Give me some real
- Doug E. Fresh now, people.</i>

53:07.185 --> 53:08.854
<i>From the top. Here we go.</i>

53:11.106 --> 53:12.482
Good night!

53:12.607 --> 53:14.317
Is everything okay?

53:14.442 --> 53:15.694
We're fine.

53:15.777 --> 53:17.696
You sure?

53:17.779 --> 53:20.198
You both seem to
be acting funny.

53:20.282 --> 53:23.118
We're terrific, just terrific.
Thanks for asking.

53:23.243 --> 53:24.786
- Okay.
- Good night.

53:24.870 --> 53:27.289
Good night.
Good night.

53:37.966 --> 53:39.301
What am I gonna do?
What happened?

53:39.426 --> 53:41.553
There aren't any tissues
left in the bathroom

53:41.636 --> 53:42.846
and I had to touch
the toilet handle.

53:42.971 --> 53:45.098
There's something on my hand though.
Okay. Let me see.

53:45.223 --> 53:47.392
You can't see it
but I can feel it!

53:47.475 --> 53:50.061
Tyler, Tyler.
It's disgusting. Nothing's...

53:50.145 --> 53:51.813
Nothing's coming off!
Let me have a look.

53:51.897 --> 53:54.900
I can feel it. There's
no tissues left, Becca.

53:54.983 --> 53:57.068
Tyler, there are tissues
underneath the sink.

53:57.152 --> 53:58.653
Where? What?
It's okay.

53:58.737 --> 54:00.030
It's too late.

54:00.113 --> 54:02.032
No, it's not gonna come off.
I think it is.

54:02.157 --> 54:04.534
Rubbing it isn't
gonna make it come off!

54:04.659 --> 54:07.162
It's okay.
It's all right.

54:07.287 --> 54:08.455
I can feel it though.

54:08.538 --> 54:10.498
I'm definitely
getting at it. Look.

54:12.792 --> 54:14.836
It's definitely coming off.

54:15.795 --> 54:17.422
You sure?
There.

54:20.008 --> 54:21.051
See?

54:21.134 --> 54:22.344
Yeah.

54:22.427 --> 54:23.970
Just look next time,
all right?

54:24.095 --> 54:25.972
I didn't know they were there.
It's okay.

56:32.891 --> 56:34.100
Becca?

56:44.819 --> 56:46.738
Stay in bed.

57:29.531 --> 57:32.408
Mom will be home
late this afternoon.

57:32.492 --> 57:34.994
We're ending
this trip tonight.

57:35.078 --> 57:37.622
We stay away from
them unless I say.

57:39.374 --> 57:40.917
Pack your bags.

57:46.589 --> 57:50.385
I still need them to
give Mom the elixir.

57:50.510 --> 57:52.762
Becca,
what's the elixir?

57:56.891 --> 57:58.726
Just pretend
like you're playing.

57:59.811 --> 58:01.813
Is everything all right?

58:01.896 --> 58:03.648
We're just playing.

58:09.070 --> 58:10.697
Uh, do you wanna
do the interview?

58:10.780 --> 58:12.740
What?
What are you doing?

58:12.824 --> 58:14.704
I thought we were
staying away from them, Becca.

58:14.742 --> 58:17.245
You're gonna interview him?

58:24.752 --> 58:28.423
Mom told me you worked
in the coal industry for a long time.

58:29.632 --> 58:31.718
I did work in a factory.

58:31.801 --> 58:33.553
I know.

58:33.636 --> 58:35.430
Worked at night.

58:36.264 --> 58:38.766
Saw a white thing
running around.

58:40.143 --> 58:41.269
A white thing?

58:41.352 --> 58:43.771
Yeah, it used to run around
the factory at night.

58:45.607 --> 58:47.859
Only I saw it.

58:47.942 --> 58:52.113
I started to tell people about it
and they didn't believe me.

58:53.323 --> 58:55.116
Had yellow eyes.

58:57.785 --> 58:59.787
Then they fired me.

59:01.414 --> 59:03.499
And nobody talked to me.

59:07.670 --> 59:09.464
Mom didn't tell me that.

59:09.631 --> 59:13.134
Oh, she doesn't know.
Happened after she left.

59:17.680 --> 59:19.641
Pop Pop, you seem down.

59:21.309 --> 59:22.810
Well, it's just, uh...

59:24.771 --> 59:26.856
The end of your trip.

59:29.442 --> 59:31.861
I know it's all
coming to an end.

59:34.822 --> 59:37.742
Why don't you just ask
Mom if you can visit?

59:38.952 --> 59:41.079
Are you really still angry?

59:48.044 --> 59:51.506
She can't get over this.
She still thinks you're mad at her.

59:59.806 --> 01:00:02.850
That whole "white thing" story,
the hairs on my arm stood up.

01:00:02.976 --> 01:00:05.603
It's definitely some sort of
late onset schizophrenia.

01:00:05.687 --> 01:00:07.897
They're both
in bad shape.

01:00:08.022 --> 01:00:10.275
Great. Our Pop Pop
has schizophrenia,

01:00:10.358 --> 01:00:13.903
and our Nana becomes Michael Myers
when the sun goes down.

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:21.995
That's Stacey.

01:00:22.078 --> 01:00:24.414
...ride in my car.

01:00:24.539 --> 01:00:27.250
Okay, stop.
What did you do...

01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:29.335
What?
Why is she angry?

01:00:30.586 --> 01:00:34.090
She must be telling them
that they need to get help.

01:00:34.215 --> 01:00:35.591
I don't...

01:00:35.675 --> 01:00:37.010
Just come
to the back here.

01:00:37.093 --> 01:00:38.720
I don't want you
to touch me.

01:00:39.887 --> 01:00:41.389
Come to the back.

01:00:42.724 --> 01:00:43.933
Okay.

01:00:46.269 --> 01:00:47.979
I got it all off.

01:00:48.104 --> 01:00:50.606
I didn't see
Stacey leave.

01:00:50.732 --> 01:00:52.066
Did you?

01:00:55.903 --> 01:00:57.947
Nana said okay.

01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:04.912
Thanks for doing this.
We're leaving soon, Nana.

01:01:05.038 --> 01:01:07.290
I'm sad it's all over.

01:01:07.373 --> 01:01:10.168
This is the last time
I'll get to ask you questions.

01:01:10.251 --> 01:01:12.337
It's like
the big end to my film,

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.130
and like you said,
you're the star.

01:01:16.758 --> 01:01:19.761
Tell me anything.
Whatever you want to talk about.

01:01:19.844 --> 01:01:23.681
I know a story.
It's about water.

01:01:23.765 --> 01:01:24.891
Great.

01:01:26.392 --> 01:01:28.394
There is a pond

01:01:28.478 --> 01:01:31.481
that has little creatures in it.

01:01:31.606 --> 01:01:36.235
These creatures are from another
planet but no one realizes it.

01:01:37.236 --> 01:01:41.616
These creatures
spit into the water all day long.

01:01:42.575 --> 01:01:46.454
Their spit can make
you sleep, but not die.

01:01:47.622 --> 01:01:51.125
When people go
underwater in the pond,

01:01:51.209 --> 01:01:54.462
they go into
a deep sleep.

01:01:54.587 --> 01:01:57.131
A really beautiful sleep.

01:01:58.424 --> 01:02:00.134
The creatures from
another planet have

01:02:00.218 --> 01:02:03.262
many people at
the bottom of the pond,

01:02:03.888 --> 01:02:06.391
storing them up.

01:02:06.474 --> 01:02:08.226
They are going to
take them back

01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:11.562
to their planet of
Sinmorfitellia one day.

01:02:16.651 --> 01:02:18.403
That's just
a made-up story.

01:02:18.486 --> 01:02:20.321
It's not real.

01:02:20.405 --> 01:02:22.532
Wow, that's some story.

01:02:22.615 --> 01:02:24.575
And the creatures
have antennas,

01:02:24.659 --> 01:02:27.453
but they are
invisible antennas.

01:02:32.291 --> 01:02:33.960
Can we talk about Mom?

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.800
You don't ever
want to see her?

01:02:44.178 --> 01:02:46.139
No.

01:02:46.264 --> 01:02:48.099
Never.

01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:52.812
On the day she left,
she must have done something.

01:02:57.692 --> 01:02:59.026
Okay, okay.

01:02:59.152 --> 01:03:01.988
Let's pretend we're
telling another story.

01:03:02.697 --> 01:03:06.451
And the story
concerns a young girl

01:03:06.534 --> 01:03:09.245
who thinks she's in love
with an older man,

01:03:09.704 --> 01:03:12.165
and they decide to
run off together.

01:03:18.171 --> 01:03:21.549
Now, the parents of the girl
warn her that this won't work.

01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:23.885
And they refuse
to let her go.

01:03:25.344 --> 01:03:27.472
And then one day,
the girl gets into a horrible fight

01:03:27.555 --> 01:03:29.348
with them
and leaves forever.

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:33.686
Now, the parents in
this story don't know it,

01:03:34.729 --> 01:03:37.482
but she misses them a lot.

01:03:37.565 --> 01:03:40.443
And she suffers greatly.

01:03:42.487 --> 01:03:44.947
And then
the worst thing happens.

01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:51.204
The man, he breaks the girl's heart
and leaves forever.

01:03:53.039 --> 01:03:55.958
And leave their two
small children behind.

01:03:57.293 --> 01:03:59.378
So, Nana,

01:03:59.462 --> 01:04:03.591
Nana, in this story,
what do you hope will happen to the girl?

01:04:06.302 --> 01:04:10.097
In this story,
is she very sad?

01:04:10.181 --> 01:04:13.476
She's inconsolable at times.
She tries everything to be happy.

01:04:13.559 --> 01:04:16.687
Medications and goes
to therapy for four years

01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:18.189
but still remains
a little sad.

01:04:18.272 --> 01:04:20.191
I don't like this story.

01:04:20.274 --> 01:04:21.484
Nana, what do you think

01:04:21.567 --> 01:04:25.154
the parents in this story should do
if they saw the girl again?

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:30.368
Nana, pretend you
were in this story

01:04:30.451 --> 01:04:33.287
and she was your daughter,
and she left.

01:04:33.371 --> 01:04:34.580
What would you say

01:04:34.664 --> 01:04:36.749
when you finally
saw her again?

01:04:40.336 --> 01:04:42.296
I would tell her,

01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:48.135
"I forgive you,
little girl."

01:05:07.405 --> 01:05:10.408
<i>"I forgive you, little girl."</i>

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.495
That's the elixir.

01:05:24.422 --> 01:05:26.591
What are you doing?

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:29.135
This is how
children play, okay?

01:05:42.315 --> 01:05:44.191
Hey, Mom should be home.

01:05:44.275 --> 01:05:45.776
Let's go and Skype with her
while they're in the back.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.028
Right.

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:51.532
This will be the denouement.

01:05:59.332 --> 01:06:00.374
<i>Hey, kiddos!</i>

01:06:00.499 --> 01:06:03.669
<i>Did you get my videos?
I know, I look like an apple.</i>

01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:05.963
<i>Trip was great.</i>

01:06:06.047 --> 01:06:07.807
<i>Miguel and I had
a little fight this morning.</i>

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.383
<i>He wanted to get
short stack pancakes,</i>

01:06:09.467 --> 01:06:11.302
<i>I told him he was gaining
a little weight.</i>

01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:13.471
<i>Can you believe it?
Things don't work out for me.</i>

01:06:13.888 --> 01:06:15.139
Mom?
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:06:15.222 --> 01:06:17.224
Mom, you need to come
and get us right now.

01:06:18.893 --> 01:06:19.977
<i>What? What happened?</i>

01:06:20.061 --> 01:06:22.813
Mom, get in the car
and come right now.

01:06:22.897 --> 01:06:25.399
<i>Do you know how long
that would take by car, Rebecca?</i>

01:06:25.483 --> 01:06:28.486
Mom, trust me, there is something
wrong with Nana and Pop Pop.

01:06:28.569 --> 01:06:30.988
I'm telling you, you need to come
and pick us up tonight.

01:06:31.072 --> 01:06:34.492
<i>Becca, you're scaring me.
My heart is in my throat.</i>

01:06:34.575 --> 01:06:36.702
We're okay now.
Just come.

01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:39.830
<i>Where are they now?</i>

01:06:39.914 --> 01:06:43.209
Uh, they're outside
by the chicken coops.

01:06:43.292 --> 01:06:44.919
They won't see you.

01:06:56.222 --> 01:06:57.223
<i>Becca...</i>

01:06:57.306 --> 01:07:00.351
They've been acting so strange, Mom.
We've been recording them.

01:07:00.434 --> 01:07:01.519
<i>Becca...</i>

01:07:01.602 --> 01:07:05.314
Yeah, I kept telling Becca
something was wrong, didn't I?

01:07:05.648 --> 01:07:06.691
<i>Becca, Tyler...</i>

01:07:06.774 --> 01:07:09.485
And Nana walks around
at night with a knife.

01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:11.779
And Pop Pop had a gun in his mouth.
<i>Rebecca, Tyler...</i>

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:14.532
I think he was
trying to hurt himself.

01:07:14.907 --> 01:07:19.704
<i>Becca, Tyler, babies,
I need you to listen to me very carefully.</i>

01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:22.623
<i>Becca, Tyler,
just listen to me.</i>

01:07:23.624 --> 01:07:24.959
We are.

01:07:27.128 --> 01:07:29.463
<i>Those aren't your grandparents.</i>

01:07:32.341 --> 01:07:34.802
What are you
talking about, Mom?

01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:39.807
<i>Where are Nana and Pop Pop?</i>

01:07:41.976 --> 01:07:45.146
<i>You've been staying
with those people the whole time?</i>

01:07:53.821 --> 01:07:55.948
<i>Masonville Police Department.</i>

01:07:59.452 --> 01:08:00.995
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:09.628
What are you guys doing?

01:08:09.712 --> 01:08:11.505
We'll be right in,
sweethearts.

01:08:12.798 --> 01:08:14.759
<i>This is the Masonville
County Police Department.</i>

01:08:14.842 --> 01:08:17.511
<i>Our officer, Jerry,
is currently out on dispatch.</i>

01:08:17.595 --> 01:08:19.180
<i>Please leave a message...</i>

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:23.184
<i>Police aren't answering.
Damn it! Stupid hick town.</i>

01:08:23.309 --> 01:08:26.979
<i>Okay. I'm gonna keep calling
from the car, I promise.</i>

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:28.689
<i>Get you and your brother out.</i>
Okay.

01:08:28.773 --> 01:08:29.982
<i>Try to get
to a neighbor.</i>

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:31.942
Just stay calm, T.
<i>I'm coming.</i>

01:08:32.067 --> 01:08:33.947
We're in a house with...

01:08:37.198 --> 01:08:40.408
After we clear up,
I have a fantastic idea.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:44.330
We should play a board game!
Families play board games.

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:45.997
It's our
last night together.

01:08:46.081 --> 01:08:47.124
Becca?

01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:49.251
You'll help me
clean up, right?

01:08:49.335 --> 01:08:51.587
You can record it
with your camera.

01:08:56.759 --> 01:08:57.843
Okay.

01:08:57.926 --> 01:08:59.220
Yeah!

01:09:22.743 --> 01:09:24.286
Maybe we should
go outside and film

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:25.996
some evening
shots of the house.

01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:29.917
Okay, sounds good, sister.

01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:33.127
Could you clean
the oven for me, Becca?

01:09:49.144 --> 01:09:51.104
Get all the way inside.

01:09:51.397 --> 01:09:52.982
Mmm, Becca?

01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:54.441
She's done it before.

01:09:54.984 --> 01:09:57.695
We really should
film something outside.

01:09:58.487 --> 01:10:00.531
Do this first.

01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:02.449
I'll be quick.

01:10:06.704 --> 01:10:08.789
Oh, this will just
take a second.

01:10:09.123 --> 01:10:11.458
Nana? Nana?

01:10:12.793 --> 01:10:13.961
I can clean those.

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:15.462
Nana,
please open the door.

01:10:15.546 --> 01:10:16.881
Oh, that's okay.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.924
Please open it.

01:10:19.008 --> 01:10:20.509
There she is.

01:10:23.387 --> 01:10:25.431
So, what was
the big fuss?

01:10:31.186 --> 01:10:32.730
Let's make it...

01:10:33.939 --> 01:10:35.983
...a perfect family night.

01:10:38.611 --> 01:10:39.653
Oh!

01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:52.750
Your Pop Pop is very competitive
with board games.

01:10:52.875 --> 01:10:54.501
Be warned.

01:10:55.419 --> 01:10:57.299
If you want
to move that over here, that's fine.

01:10:57.338 --> 01:10:59.381
If we use this table,
there's not room for the cookies.

01:10:59.465 --> 01:11:00.925
T-Diamond Stylus
and I are gonna do

01:11:01.008 --> 01:11:03.052
one last interview
outside and be right back.

01:11:03.135 --> 01:11:04.345
You can
sit over there.

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:06.263
Figure out
what the teams are.

01:11:09.975 --> 01:11:12.645
- Go, go, go. Hurry.
- Brought a coat. I'm coming.

01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:15.689
Okay, open it.

01:11:16.482 --> 01:11:18.734
What is that?

01:11:19.985 --> 01:11:23.155
Picked teams.
It's young versus old.

01:11:37.169 --> 01:11:40.714
Stop rolling all
the dice on every roll!

01:11:40.881 --> 01:11:42.132
You're losing
the game for us!

01:11:42.216 --> 01:11:43.425
No, I'm not.

01:11:43.509 --> 01:11:44.843
We don't
have to keep score.

01:11:44.927 --> 01:11:46.845
I'm a <i>Yahtzee</i> master.

01:11:46.929 --> 01:11:50.140
Doesn't everyone in the cafeteria call me
the <i>Yahtzee</i> master?

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:53.310
What cafeteria?

01:11:53.727 --> 01:11:55.437
You wanna win at <i>Yahtzee,</i>
listen to me.

01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:58.649
You're not a <i>Yahtzee</i> master.
That takes 10 years.

01:12:04.154 --> 01:12:08.575
See? He's using strategy!
A Milton Bradley-approved strategy.

01:12:08.701 --> 01:12:09.994
I don't know
what I'm doing.

01:12:10.744 --> 01:12:13.330
This game is made
by Hasbro, Pop Pop.

01:12:13.414 --> 01:12:14.832
That's a lie.

01:12:14.957 --> 01:12:16.917
It used to be made
by Milton Bradley.

01:12:17.001 --> 01:12:19.128
Who cares, Becca?

01:12:19.211 --> 01:12:20.921
Finally!

01:12:21.046 --> 01:12:22.881
I'm having so much fun.

01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:31.348
Wow, my battery's running low.
I'll be right back.

01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:35.519
You keep playing
with them, T.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.147
Just keep playing.

01:12:38.439 --> 01:12:39.565
I'll be right back.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.142
Becca?

01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:22.983
Katy Perry.

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:28.197
What time is it, Nana?

01:13:28.864 --> 01:13:30.657
Isn't it getting late?

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:37.122
Yahtzee!

01:13:37.206 --> 01:13:38.248
Becca!

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:45.380
I'm going down
into the basement.

01:13:49.176 --> 01:13:51.845
I think they have
my grandparents here.

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.355
Pop Pop?

01:14:02.106 --> 01:14:04.858
Nana? Are you down here?

01:14:15.786 --> 01:14:18.038
Things are not
working out tonight.

01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:29.049
It's half past nine.

01:14:37.558 --> 01:14:40.269
I have to get your Nana to her room.
You wait here.

01:14:53.824 --> 01:14:55.075
Nana?

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.244
Pop Pop?

01:15:15.137 --> 01:15:17.598
"Maple Shade
Psychiatric Hospital"?

01:15:23.937 --> 01:15:27.191
Should the three of us
finish the game?

01:15:43.707 --> 01:15:46.710
My name is Becca Jamison.
If you find this footage...

01:15:46.835 --> 01:15:48.545
My name is Mitchel.

01:15:50.339 --> 01:15:53.008
They kept telling us
you were so great.

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:55.719
How you're gonna visit,
how you're gonna be a family.

01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:57.930
That was a bad thing
they did.

01:15:58.013 --> 01:16:00.557
They knew Claire
had put her two children

01:16:00.641 --> 01:16:02.684
in those suitcases
in the pond.

01:16:03.727 --> 01:16:07.147
She deserved this week
as a grandma.

01:16:07.231 --> 01:16:10.150
Claire's kids are
on Sinmorfitellia.

01:16:11.693 --> 01:16:13.320
You're gonna join them!

01:16:18.992 --> 01:16:19.993
Stop!

01:16:22.746 --> 01:16:27.501
The only way to Sinmorfitellia
from here is through the well.

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:28.794
Stop!

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:33.257
Wasn't it a perfect week?

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:35.550
I promised her
it would be.

01:16:37.928 --> 01:16:40.514
The white thing with
yellow eyes is real.

01:16:41.682 --> 01:16:44.685
It waits for us.
I saw it out in the field.

01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:48.021
It was laughing at us.

01:16:54.903 --> 01:16:56.363
They're murderers, Tyler!

01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:57.739
Becca!

01:16:57.864 --> 01:16:59.950
Get out of here, dummy! Run!

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:04.371
Becca!

01:17:09.042 --> 01:17:11.044
We're all
dying today, Becca.

01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:12.587
No...

01:17:46.663 --> 01:17:50.500
You have
a magic spell on you.

01:18:39.341 --> 01:18:40.675
Help!

01:18:40.801 --> 01:18:41.968
Help!

01:19:02.155 --> 01:19:04.199
I never liked you.

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:10.080
Claire?

01:19:11.998 --> 01:19:13.792
I'll tell you a story.

01:19:54.875 --> 01:19:58.170
I have to go to the train
to go to the costume party.

01:19:58.295 --> 01:20:00.088
It's a company party.

01:20:14.352 --> 01:20:16.062
That's not now.

01:20:17.856 --> 01:20:19.274
I know that!

01:20:53.183 --> 01:20:55.936
You have a problem
with germs, don't you?

01:21:42.983 --> 01:21:44.234
I don't like you.

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:23.398
You are blind.
You are blind.

01:22:24.399 --> 01:22:28.236
I am the exposer.
I am a seer.

01:22:28.361 --> 01:22:32.907
I see the veiny...

01:22:33.867 --> 01:22:35.577
...deformed...

01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:38.747
...face of the world.

01:23:02.187 --> 01:23:04.731
We can all be saved tonight.

01:23:05.857 --> 01:23:09.194
Your magic spell
will be lifted.

01:23:20.288 --> 01:23:21.956
Becca!

01:23:24.918 --> 01:23:27.253
Have you been
watching me?

01:23:27.379 --> 01:23:30.048
Run, Tyler, run!

01:23:33.718 --> 01:23:35.261
Eyes on the runner!

01:23:35.387 --> 01:23:38.473
Watch his hips!
Watch his hips!

01:23:42.769 --> 01:23:43.895
Stay low!

01:23:43.978 --> 01:23:46.481
Wrap the arms!
Wrap the arms!

01:23:46.648 --> 01:23:47.732
Tyler?

01:23:56.074 --> 01:23:57.826
Tyler!

01:23:58.368 --> 01:23:59.577
No!

01:23:59.703 --> 01:24:03.415
Any other crazy bitch-ass
fucking people here?

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.584
Come on out!
Come on out!

01:24:42.704 --> 01:24:44.914
Becca, Tyler!

01:24:45.123 --> 01:24:46.963
Stand by.
I've arrived on site.

01:24:47.292 --> 01:24:48.376
Babies!

01:24:53.673 --> 01:24:55.425
Oh, my God!

01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:58.178
I'm here. I'm here.

01:25:04.267 --> 01:25:05.310
I'm here.

01:25:06.394 --> 01:25:08.104
Is this everybody?
Come over here.

01:25:08.188 --> 01:25:09.314
Oh, my God!

01:25:12.275 --> 01:25:14.110
Let's go! Move, come on.

01:25:14.819 --> 01:25:18.406
We need an ambulance!
Hurry up! Over here.

01:25:19.699 --> 01:25:22.410
Yo, Jimmy, watch that front door.
Go around the back.

01:25:23.745 --> 01:25:26.414
Come here,
come here, come here.

01:25:48.353 --> 01:25:52.398
Mom, honestly,
you know you don't have to do this.

01:25:52.482 --> 01:25:54.150
I want to
do this for you.

01:25:59.489 --> 01:26:01.074
I used to sing.

01:26:02.534 --> 01:26:05.537
My mother used to say
that she wasn't listening,

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:08.414
but I know she was hiding behind this
big clock down the hall,

01:26:08.498 --> 01:26:11.835
the kitchen towel over
her mouth to hide her smile.

01:26:13.169 --> 01:26:15.839
She thought I had a better voice than
Olivia Newton-John.

01:26:15.922 --> 01:26:19.300
Olivia Newton-John
was like, her Elvis.

01:26:20.385 --> 01:26:23.263
My father was
a gentle man.

01:26:23.346 --> 01:26:26.808
We'd take these long walks together,
we'd never say a word.

01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:30.812
I used to wake up early when
I was a child. Work on some project.

01:26:32.272 --> 01:26:35.942
My father thought that meant
I was gonna do great things.

01:26:38.069 --> 01:26:41.155
Anyway, as I said before,
the day I...

01:26:44.075 --> 01:26:47.245
The day I left
turned really badly.

01:26:47.453 --> 01:26:49.414
My parents cursed at me.

01:26:51.624 --> 01:26:56.504
I moved to the door to leave and
my mom stepped in front of me.

01:26:56.588 --> 01:26:58.631
I hit my mother.

01:27:00.216 --> 01:27:02.760
And then my dad hit me,

01:27:02.844 --> 01:27:07.140
and then we kind of stood there in shock,
and then I left.

01:27:09.309 --> 01:27:12.145
They reached out
to me soon after.

01:27:12.228 --> 01:27:14.105
I refused to
take their calls.

01:27:19.193 --> 01:27:22.655
I know you were trying
to get me forgiveness, Becca.

01:27:24.574 --> 01:27:27.160
You didn't have
to do that, honey.

01:27:28.912 --> 01:27:31.539
It was there
whenever I wanted it.

01:27:59.901 --> 01:28:02.195
Please...

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.697
Don't hold
onto anger, Becca.

01:28:07.992 --> 01:28:09.577
Hear me?

01:28:37.814 --> 01:28:42.026
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:43.277
Blow them out!

01:28:43.403 --> 01:28:44.570
Okay, okay!

01:28:47.198 --> 01:28:48.700
Yay!

01:29:05.591 --> 01:29:07.760
<i>I may be 13,
may not live in the hood</i>

01:29:07.885 --> 01:29:11.055
<i>May not carry no chrome,
may not be allowed a cell phone at dinner</i>

01:29:11.139 --> 01:29:15.101
<i>But I'm young and can do
18 pushups and I speak the truth</i>

01:29:15.184 --> 01:29:18.354
<i>My sister tried to make a film about
old people feeling dismay</i>

01:29:18.479 --> 01:29:20.106
<i>But it didn't
turn out that way</i>

01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:22.942
<i>She had to scream and kill
and got vomit in her face</i>

01:29:23.067 --> 01:29:24.610
<i>Chunks in her hair
from a stew</i>

01:29:24.694 --> 01:29:27.947
<i>But she washed them out with
Herbal Essence Body Envy Shampoo</i>

01:29:28.031 --> 01:29:31.034
<i>So here's a few things T-Diamond
learned from visiting elders</i>

01:29:31.117 --> 01:29:32.952
<i>Adult diapers
come in many a name</i>

01:29:33.036 --> 01:29:35.538
<i>There's Attends and Depends
and Medline and Prevail</i>

01:29:35.663 --> 01:29:36.748
<i>But they all the same</i>

01:29:36.873 --> 01:29:39.250
<i>They keep your mess from spilling out
and they keep it contained</i>

01:29:39.333 --> 01:29:40.668
<i>So here's the truth</i>

01:29:40.752 --> 01:29:42.879
<i>I got messed up with a killer
who's truly insane</i>

01:29:42.962 --> 01:29:44.422
<i>I will try not to refrain</i>

01:29:44.505 --> 01:29:47.717
<i>Try to overcome my pain 'cause
one day it will get me my fame</i>

01:29:47.842 --> 01:29:50.094
<i>Like 50 Cent getting shot
and being lame, you see</i>

01:29:50.219 --> 01:29:52.764
<i>I got a diaper shoved in
my face for half an hour</i>

01:29:52.889 --> 01:29:53.973
<i>I thought it was over</i>

01:29:54.098 --> 01:29:56.434
<i>I thought I'd be under the ground
growing four-leaf clovers</i>

01:29:56.517 --> 01:29:57.977
<i>Some dude going
over me with a mower</i>

01:29:58.061 --> 01:30:00.501
<i>But that's not what happened
you see, 'cause I went all mental</i>

01:30:00.563 --> 01:30:03.107
<i>I was like Mel Gibson</i>
<i>at the end of a</i> Lethal Weapon <i>rental</i>

01:30:03.191 --> 01:30:05.068
<i>I'm straight now,
I'm not gonna lie</i>

01:30:05.151 --> 01:30:07.737
<i>For three weeks that diaper
left me like a basket case</i>

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.490
<i>I had to use two whole
Dove bars on my face</i>

01:30:10.615 --> 01:30:13.034
<i>And one last thing
and I don't mean to sicken</i>

01:30:13.117 --> 01:30:17.288
<i>But the truth is
shit doesn't taste like chicken</i>

01:30:17.413 --> 01:30:21.167
Oh, Shania Twain, bitches!

01:30:22.305 --> 01:30:28.392
