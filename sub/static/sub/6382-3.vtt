55:44.467 --> 55:47.083
I was just having a talk with Sookie...

55:47.762 --> 55:49.798
...and now I'm heading on home.

55:49.972 --> 55:53.385
Look, I don't agree with any
of this nonsense. It's just my job.

[SNIFFS]

56:02.777 --> 56:04.768
-Cute dog.
-Oh.

56:04.946 --> 56:08.484
Belongs to one of my daughters.
You probably haven't heard, I got kids now...

56:08.658 --> 56:10.774
...four of them. Super cute.

56:10.952 --> 56:13.284
I had not heard that. Congratulations.

56:13.454 --> 56:16.036
Children, what a blessing.

56:16.207 --> 56:19.495
-That's what I have to keep reminding myself.
-Yeah, you do.

56:20.002 --> 56:21.663
Got to enjoy them.

56:22.547 --> 56:25.710
Time goes so fast.
They'll be out of the house before you know it.

56:26.634 --> 56:28.966
Thanks for the advice, Vampire Bill.
I mean that.

56:29.136 --> 56:32.879
You're welcome, sheriff. I'll say good night...

56:33.516 --> 56:35.222
-...go straight home.
-Night.
