WEBVTT

00:04.250 --> 00:06.115
Previously on Siren...

00:06.120 --> 00:07.109
[Ben]
She's coming back.

00:07.120 --> 00:08.246
Why did you
come back, Ryn?

00:08.250 --> 00:09.740
We need food.

00:09.750 --> 00:11.411
_ You haven't seen
this girl around, have you?

00:11.420 --> 00:14.287
No. Why? Is this
part of that murder case?

00:14.290 --> 00:15.746
Somebody said
they saw you with her

00:15.750 --> 00:17.160
at Jerry's party last night.

00:17.170 --> 00:18.410
You really think
I wouldn't tell you?

00:18.420 --> 00:19.660
She's dangerous, Maddie.

00:19.670 --> 00:20.659
I'm gonna find her.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.285
[Xander] Hey, stop!

00:25.250 --> 00:26.285
I saw her.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.036
I was right.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.031
Ben, you need
to get down here.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.109
We're gonna go get her.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.417
I know what she did to you.

00:35.290 --> 00:37.167
If you want to see her again,

00:37.170 --> 00:39.411
tell me what's
gom' on out there.

00:39.420 --> 00:42.241
There's a government
tra_wler off the coast
of Bristol Cove right now.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.615
The lures will attract them,

00:43.620 --> 00:45.827
and the trawler
will start harvesting them.

00:45.830 --> 00:47.821
[Marissa]
Stop right there!

00:47.830 --> 00:49.240
[hisses]

00:50.750 --> 00:52.877
[Ryn grunting and hissing]

00:54.330 --> 00:55.991
[grunting]

00:56.000 --> 00:58.787
[hissing]

00:58.790 --> 00:59.779
[screams]

00:59.790 --> 01:02.281
[grunting]

01:06.210 --> 01:07.609
What the hell's happening?

01:07.620 --> 01:09.952
Busted her
down by the dock.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.417
She was about to have
herself a little skinny-dip
when I spotted her.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.240
I asked her
to come qUIet.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.320
[Ryn screaming]

01:16.330 --> 01:18.036
Clearly she didn't
take your advice.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.110
[screaming]

01:20.120 --> 01:22.327
Whatever she's on,
Sheriff, it's strong.

01:22.330 --> 01:25.208
Maybe she helps us
find the other one.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.872
[Ryn hissing]

01:27.880 --> 01:30.451
[screaming]

01:50.960 --> 01:53.417
Hey.
We need to haul ass.

01:53.420 --> 01:55.411
She could be right offshore
or a hundred miles out.

01:55.420 --> 01:57.285
You got a plan here, Xan?

01:57.290 --> 01:59.827
I mean, how you thinkin'
you're gonna catch one?

01:59.830 --> 02:01.377
We got a lure, remember?

02:01.380 --> 02:03.325
It won't be that easy.

02:03.330 --> 02:06.208
That guy, Decker, he
told me that the Navy's
tracking them, too.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.609
They got a boat
out there right now,

02:07.620 --> 02:09.167
and they know exactly
how to find 'em.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.616
Son of a bitch.

02:11.620 --> 02:13.281
Did he say where?

02:13.290 --> 02:15.076
Maddie's working on it.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.240
She's trying to figure out
where they're trawling.

02:16.250 --> 02:19.117
[noise overhead]

02:24.540 --> 02:26.576
About damn time.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.413
Please tell me Janine
did not just uncuff me
from her bedpost

02:29.420 --> 02:30.910
so that I
can go on another hunt

02:30.920 --> 02:32.456
for guppy girl.

02:32.460 --> 02:34.451
Damn right, horn dog.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.371
Ben says the government's
got another boat out there

02:36.380 --> 02:37.824
trying to steal
our catch... again.

02:37.830 --> 02:39.070
We gotta beat them to it.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.820
So now you want to
take on the Naw?

02:40.830 --> 02:43.378
There could be, like,
50 SEALs on board that boat.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.200
The Navy won't
even know we're there.

02:45.210 --> 02:47.030
We can shadow them.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.452
They'll be dragging
their nets for miles.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.530
We can hang back,
cut them free,

02:51.540 --> 02:54.452
get the mermaids
before they even
haul in their catch.

02:54.460 --> 02:57.327
Like the... Like the sea lions
off Thompson Seamount.

02:57.330 --> 02:59.571
They used to do
the same thing to us.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.241
Cruisin' in our wake,
scoopin' up our catch.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.741
And so we're the sea lions?

03:03.750 --> 03:05.957
Exactly.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.666
Now we just need
to convince your dad.

03:07.670 --> 03:10.241
No. No, there's no time
to wait for him.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.535
If your dad finds out--

03:11.540 --> 03:13.610
I'm callin'_ the shots
on this one.

03:13.620 --> 03:15.201
All right?

03:27.960 --> 03:31.953
In the night
I've seen the worst

03:31.960 --> 03:33.450
Of the world

03:33.460 --> 03:36.827
Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh

03:36.830 --> 03:38.115
Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh

03:38.120 --> 03:40.532
In the night

03:40.540 --> 03:42.781
I've seen the worst

03:42.790 --> 03:44.610
Of the world

03:44.620 --> 03:45.917
[rumbling]

03:49.960 --> 03:52.952
Whoa-oh-oh

03:52.960 --> 03:55.326
It started right
in the middle of the night

03:55.330 --> 03:58.242
Now we'll defend
my home

03:58.250 --> 04:01.162
It started right
in the middle of the night

04:01.170 --> 04:03.377
Whoo-ooh-hoo-ooh

04:05.040 --> 04:07.110
[placid high-pitched calls]

04:14.000 --> 04:15.319
[hisses]

04:15.330 --> 04:17.161
Quite the fighter.

04:20.790 --> 04:23.281
I hope we're done
with all that.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.451
You'r_e aware that
by agreeing to talk to me,

04:27.460 --> 04:29.667
you waive your right
to have an attorney present?

04:29.670 --> 04:33.379
I want to go home.

04:33.380 --> 04:36.372
Tell me
what I want to know,

04:36.380 --> 04:39.417
and we might be able
to make that happen.

04:42.250 --> 04:44.161
Why don't we start
from the beginning?

04:45.710 --> 04:48.326
You recognize him?

04:50.210 --> 04:51.666
Yes.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.074
How about this?

05:00.460 --> 05:02.371
Yes.

05:02.380 --> 05:05.031
What happened?

05:05.040 --> 05:06.746
I got in car.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.868
What happened after
you got in the car?

05:14.880 --> 05:17.110
Car moved.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.411
Is Donnie the one
who sold you the drugs?

05:31.620 --> 05:33.611
Look, I know
he assaulted you.

05:33.620 --> 05:35.451
And I'm sure
it's not the first time

05:35.460 --> 05:37.075
he ever tried
something like that,

05:37.080 --> 05:39.617
but if you want
out of this,

05:39.620 --> 05:42.874
I need to know
the full story.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.996
Now, who killed Donnie?

05:47.460 --> 05:48.870
Ryn.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.496
And who's Ryn?

05:51.500 --> 05:53.411
I am Ryn.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.451
He's
a
pretty
large
m
an
I

06:01.460 --> 06:04.497
and you are a small girl.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.708
Was someone else involved?

06:07.710 --> 06:09.496
[hisses]

06:09.500 --> 06:11.536
I understand wanting
to protect someone

06:11.540 --> 06:13.280
who's important to you,

06:13.290 --> 06:15.872
but sometimes you can't.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.576
Not at the expense
of others.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.457
Now, drugs are one thing,

06:20.460 --> 06:23.247
but murder...

06:23.250 --> 06:25.536
I'll ask you again.

06:25.540 --> 06:27.496
Who helped you?

06:30.460 --> 06:34.453
Ben and Maddie help Ryn.

06:34.460 --> 06:37.031
What--

06:37.040 --> 06:38.610
What did you say?

06:40.540 --> 06:44.704
Ben and Maddie help Ryn.

06:47.170 --> 06:49.240
My Maddie?

06:49.250 --> 06:51.241
Maddie Bishop?

06:56.540 --> 06:58.280
Thanks, Nick.

07:01.710 --> 07:06.204
[line ringing]

07:06.210 --> 07:08.326
[Maddie] I just spoke
to Nick on the Sea King.

07:08.330 --> 07:09.661
Gave him a description
of that trawler?

07:09.670 --> 07:11.069
He spotted her
on their way out.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.069
You got a pen?

07:12.080 --> 07:13.411
Yes. Yeah.

07:13.420 --> 07:15.069
Give it to me.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.071
[Maddie] The Naw ship
is called the Cortez.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.411
Course heading

07:18.420 --> 07:21.241
48 degrees, 49 point,

07:21.250 --> 07:23.036
268 minutes west.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.668
Maddie, you're amazing.
Thank you.

07:25.670 --> 07:27.570
You have no idea what
you're gonna find out there.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.241
[Ben]
Look, we got no choice.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.707
I need Xander and his boat
if I'm gonna stop them.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.575
Yeah, and what happens
if he catches one?

07:33.580 --> 07:36.413
At least I'll be here.

07:36.420 --> 07:37.739
Maybe I can try
and convince him

07:37.750 --> 07:39.706
that he shouldn't be
hunting them.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.200
[Maddie]
Ben, be careful.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.950
Always.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.916
[Marissa]
Midnight seal crisis?

07:44.920 --> 07:48.378
Marissa, what are you
doing here?

07:48.380 --> 07:49.608
Is my dad all right?

07:49.620 --> 07:51.531
Sheriff's ﬁne.

07:51.540 --> 07:54.703
He, uh, sent me
over to bring you back
to the station, actually.

07:54.710 --> 07:56.166
What? Why?

07:56.170 --> 07:58.161
I'll let him tell you that.

07:58.170 --> 08:00.320
Look, just please tell him
I can't right now.

08:00.330 --> 08:01.820
I'm helping Ben.

08:01.830 --> 08:04.617
He made it pretty clear
that it wasn't a request.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.741
[alarm sounding]

08:26.250 --> 08:27.990
[groans]

08:44.080 --> 08:46.742
[Siren song playing]

08:57.170 --> 09:04.076
[Siren song echoing]

09:12.250 --> 09:14.616
What's your angle
here, dude?

09:14.620 --> 09:16.531
What do you mean?

09:16.540 --> 09:17.700
Oh, I don't know.

09:17.710 --> 09:19.075
All of a sudden,
the marine biologist

09:19.080 --> 09:21.708
is on board
with hunting mermaids?

09:21.710 --> 09:23.826
Just 'cause Xander buys it

09:23.830 --> 09:26.071
doesn't mean that we are.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.071
Think whatever you want.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.036
Xander asked for my help,

09:30.040 --> 09:32.076
so I'm gonna
give it to him.

09:36.290 --> 09:37.826
Excuse me.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.911
Where we at?

09:49.920 --> 09:51.410
The sea's up.

09:51.420 --> 09:52.660
We're in for some chop.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.952
All right,
we got another hour
till we're in range.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.325
Copy that.

10:13.330 --> 10:15.878
Gotta say, man.
It suits you.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.035
What the hell is goin' on?!

10:19.040 --> 10:20.917
Why are we at sea?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.285
Huh?!

10:22.290 --> 10:24.918
It was my idea.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.785
I saw her, Pop.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.326
I mean, I saw her.

10:28.330 --> 10:29.786
She's back
out in the water.

10:29.790 --> 10:31.530
We know
where she might be.

10:31.540 --> 10:32.996
We know where there
might be more.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.820
Right?
There's more like her.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.616
Move.

10:36.620 --> 10:39.498
Dad, I got this, all right?

10:47.040 --> 10:48.871
I'm takin' us back.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.377
You two really thought
you were just gonna
steal my boat

10:53.380 --> 10:54.824
to catch your mermaid?

10:54.830 --> 10:57.788
Him comin' up with
somethin' like this, I get.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.076
But you, you're supposed
to be the levelheaded one.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.957
We're not the ones
stealing anything.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.325
The government is.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.321
Yeah, and they already
stole from us once.

11:05.330 --> 11:06.957
You think it's a coincidence

11:06.960 --> 11:09.372
that they haven't fined you
for overfishing these lanes?

11:09.380 --> 11:10.870
That's on your dad.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.950
Yeah, and they used him,

11:12.960 --> 11:14.780
just like they used you.

11:14.790 --> 11:15.950
Nobody used me.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.076
We raked in a lot of cash.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.616
Yeah!

11:19.620 --> 11:21.747
But meanwhile,
we been helping them

11:21.750 --> 11:23.160
get ready to catch
more of these things.

11:23.170 --> 11:24.785
Military's out there

11:24.790 --> 11:27.611
on a ship called
the Cortez right now,

11:27.620 --> 11:28.996
messing with your waters.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.742
Now, you can turn
a blind eye like everyone else,

11:31.750 --> 11:33.570
or you can do
something about it.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.570
Thank you.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.578
They say
these saltwater tanks
don't need a filter.

12:06.580 --> 12:09.993
I don't buy it.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.377
Damn thing gets
dirtier by the day.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.200
You had Marissa
bring me down here

12:14.210 --> 12:16.166
to help you
fix your fish tank?

12:16.170 --> 12:19.242
I wouldn't think of wasting
your time like that.

12:19.250 --> 12:22.572
Got something very important
I want to ask you.

12:22.580 --> 12:25.993
Remember that time
we made our pact?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.912
You were only ten.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.787
Your mom
had nearly overdosed.

12:31.790 --> 12:34.281
I didn't want you
to know what had happened,

12:34.290 --> 12:36.281
so... [chuckles]

12:36.290 --> 12:40.329
I took you to
your favorite restaurant
for a milkshake.

12:40.330 --> 12:43.993
But even then, you knew.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.787
You saw right through
my little distraction.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.369
So right then and there,
we made our deal.

12:53.380 --> 12:55.826
No matter what happened,

12:55.830 --> 12:58.162
we would never lie
to each other.

12:58.170 --> 13:02.413
And you have broken
that pact, Maddie.

13:02.420 --> 13:05.742
And you're gonna
tell me why.

13:10.170 --> 13:11.990
[thunder]

13:18.250 --> 13:20.115
I feel like a greenhorn
all over again.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.247
Yeah, at least for you,
it's just temporary.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.491
Hey, that'll change
soon enough.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.876
Ha! Right, man!

13:25.880 --> 13:28.075
I mean, this was
supposed to be my chance!

13:28.080 --> 13:30.071
I took the boat so I could--

13:30.080 --> 13:31.616
I don't know,
so I could prove myself.

13:31.620 --> 13:33.781
Do this on my own.

13:33.790 --> 13:34.996
Son of a bitch
casts a shadow

13:35.000 --> 13:36.160
almost as big
as his ego.

13:36.170 --> 13:38.286
Xan, you're not
the only son around here

13:38.290 --> 13:39.780
who's also an employee.

13:39.790 --> 13:42.076
Try livin' up
to the expectations

13:42.080 --> 13:44.036
of the guy
your whole town depends on.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.996
Thanks

13:48.000 --> 13:49.956
for backin' me up
in there.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.450
Sure.

13:51.460 --> 13:55.032
[beeping]

13:58.830 --> 13:59.910
[thunder]

14:06.960 --> 14:08.166
Here we go.

14:08.170 --> 14:09.706
Let's catch us
a mermaid.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.996
Okay, let's do this.

14:19.790 --> 14:22.111
Comin' up
on the coordinates now.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.497
Keep your eyes peeled.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.161
Once we're in her wake,

14:26.170 --> 14:28.912
you guys start
takin' their nets.

14:32.210 --> 14:33.700
[Ben]
Still nothin' on radar.

14:33.710 --> 14:35.701
[Sean]
Fog's messin' with it.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.285
We should be able
to see it by now.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.747
Where the hell is it?

14:52.880 --> 14:55.075
Dad, Dad, Dad!
Watch out!

14:55.080 --> 14:56.069
Fire it up!

14:58.000 --> 14:59.536
-[Xander] Reverse engines!
-[Ben] Go, go!

15:05.210 --> 15:06.029
[crash]

15:06.040 --> 15:07.075
[groaning]

15:17.210 --> 15:19.576
[Xander] So much
for sneakin' up on 'em.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.417
[Ben] Why the hell
is it dark?

15:25.420 --> 15:28.958
Well, you might as well
go say hello, boys.

15:30.170 --> 15:32.240
Eyes peeled.

15:34.790 --> 15:36.951
All right, stay sharp!

15:50.250 --> 15:52.571
Hey, hey, look.

15:52.580 --> 15:53.569
Look, there's blood.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.992
Where the hell is everyone?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.036
Uh, maybe it's chow time?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.496
Yeah, but for who?

16:01.330 --> 16:04.322
Hey, you guys check inside.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.747
Hello?

16:12.750 --> 16:14.877
Anyone home?

16:18.880 --> 16:20.916
I'm seein' a lot of blood.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.377
It's empty.

16:27.380 --> 16:30.497
Looks like they were gonna
use these to scoop 'em up?

16:34.290 --> 16:36.246
Coffee's still warm.

16:46.170 --> 16:48.411
What the hell happened here?

16:48.420 --> 16:50.536
Nothing good.

16:55.620 --> 16:58.282
[Siren song playing]

16:58.290 --> 17:01.111
[phone ringing]

17:07.290 --> 17:08.917
[sighs]

17:08.920 --> 17:11.115
[ringing]

17:12.170 --> 17:13.910
[Decker] Yeah?

17:13.920 --> 17:15.785
Decker, I need you
to report back immediately.

17:15.790 --> 17:18.702
Sir, what for? I'm--
I'm running down a lead.

17:18.710 --> 17:21.201
To hell with your lead.
We've lost contact
with the Cortez.

17:21.210 --> 17:22.495
What?

17:22.500 --> 17:25.321
How long since
the last communication?

17:25.330 --> 17:27.378
No response since 0100 hours.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.166
I'm sending in
a retrieval team,

17:29.170 --> 17:30.614
and I want you here
when they get back.

17:31.620 --> 17:33.167
[phone beeps]

17:37.380 --> 17:39.280
Did you find anything?

17:39.290 --> 17:42.111
Nothin'. It's like
they all vanished.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.371
[Xander] Yeah, but how?

17:43.380 --> 17:45.575
What the hell?

17:47.290 --> 17:49.076
Uh, guys?

17:54.330 --> 17:55.911
[metal rings]

18:04.330 --> 18:06.912
We gotta get
off the water now!

18:06.920 --> 18:09.036
We need to get
off this boat, now!

18:09.040 --> 18:10.826
Chris, drop it!

18:13.210 --> 18:14.871
[Sean]
I'm gettin' us outta here!

18:16.170 --> 18:18.456
[engine starts]

18:27.250 --> 18:29.662
You're trying to get me
to confess to something

18:29.670 --> 18:31.206
I don't have a clue about.

18:31.210 --> 18:34.919
I wanted to give you a chance
to come clean on your own.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.070
But it seems the truth
is a difficult thing

18:37.080 --> 18:39.207
for you to tell these days.

18:39.210 --> 18:40.916
I guess I have
to get it from Ryn.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.410
How do you--

18:44.290 --> 18:46.667
Oh, Marissa brought her in
a few hours ago.

18:46.670 --> 18:49.457
She already confessed
to killing Donnie Price,

18:49.460 --> 18:52.281
and it didn't take her long
to give up you and Ben.

18:52.290 --> 18:53.109
Oh, my God.

18:55.330 --> 18:57.571
How in the hell
did you get yourself

18:57.580 --> 18:59.571
wrapped up
into this madness?

19:02.380 --> 19:05.281
She showed up
about a month ago.

19:05.290 --> 19:06.530
Ben found her.

19:06.540 --> 19:07.950
Ben brought you into this?!

19:07.960 --> 19:09.370
It's not like that!
He, uh...

19:09.380 --> 19:10.950
Ryn was hurt.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.245
She came to us
for help,

19:12.250 --> 19:13.877
so we helped her.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.324
That's not a crime,
is it?

19:15.330 --> 19:17.742
As soon as you knew
what she did,

19:17.750 --> 19:20.287
you should have come to me.

19:21.750 --> 19:23.240
It's more complicated.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.286
I don't think it is.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.326
You see this girl,

19:27.330 --> 19:28.706
she's messed up,

19:28.710 --> 19:30.325
you feel a duty to help her.

19:30.330 --> 19:31.877
I get that.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.246
But there's a lot more
gom' on here, Maddie.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.241
She's protecting someone,

19:36.250 --> 19:38.457
someone very dangerous,

19:38.460 --> 19:40.280
and I need to know who.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.489
Donna.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.615
Donna?

19:44.620 --> 19:46.326
It's her sister.

19:46.330 --> 19:48.286
Where can I find her?

19:48.290 --> 19:49.871
-I don't know.
-Ohh!

19:49.880 --> 19:52.826
Look, if you let me talk
to Ryn, I can find out.

19:52.830 --> 19:54.377
So the two of you can
get your story straight?

19:55.540 --> 19:56.916
Not a chance.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.410
Dad, the only way
Ryn will talk

19:58.420 --> 20:00.490
is if it's to me.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.877
Why is that?

20:04.330 --> 20:07.242
Because she--
she trusts me.

20:12.330 --> 20:13.911
[door opens]

20:13.920 --> 20:17.458
-Maddie!
-I'm here. It's okay.

20:17.460 --> 20:18.449
Are you all right?

20:18.460 --> 20:20.109
[Dale]
Yeah, she's fine.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.076
You said that
she would talk to you,

20:22.080 --> 20:23.490
so let's have it.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.910
Where's the sister?

20:24.920 --> 20:28.287
It's okay.
He's my father, my family.

20:28.290 --> 20:29.416
You can trust him.

20:33.120 --> 20:36.704
Sister is going
to stop bad men

20:36.710 --> 20:38.109
on the water.

20:39.500 --> 20:40.876
Ben's out there.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.324
Ben in danger.

20:42.330 --> 20:43.877
[Dale] What is she
talkin' about?

20:43.880 --> 20:45.370
Bad men on the water?

20:45.380 --> 20:47.075
I have to get
to a radio to warn Ben.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.160
Warn him about what?

20:48.170 --> 20:49.455
No!

20:49.460 --> 20:51.109
-Ryn? Okay, okay.
-I'll stop sister

20:51.120 --> 20:52.371
before she hurts Ben.

20:52.380 --> 20:54.029
No one is going anywhere!

20:54.040 --> 20:55.496
-[grunting]
-Calm down!

20:55.500 --> 20:57.286
Till I know what the hell
is gom' on!

20:57.290 --> 20:58.951
[panﬁng]

20:58.960 --> 21:01.531
None of this will mean
anything unless he knows.

21:03.710 --> 21:05.280
Knows what?

21:13.460 --> 21:15.610
There's a reason
the blood found

21:15.620 --> 21:18.783
_ at Donnie Price's
crime scene wasn't human.

21:21.830 --> 21:24.321
Maddie, I swear to God,
if you're smokin'
the same stuff that she's--

21:24.330 --> 21:26.537
When I was little,

21:26.540 --> 21:29.031
you would tell me
Haida myths, remember?

21:29.040 --> 21:31.998
About the shape-shifters
who could transform

21:32.000 --> 21:33.490
into spirit animals.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.706
Those were just stories.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.201
No!

21:37.210 --> 21:38.325
They weren't.

21:48.540 --> 21:51.418
[whooshing]

22:01.580 --> 22:03.536
Dad, no, we--

22:03.540 --> 22:04.666
We can't go home
empty-handed.

22:04.670 --> 22:06.240
You saw that boat.

22:06.250 --> 22:07.956
I am not puttin'
my crew at risk.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.996
If we caught
even one of them,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.616
just one,
our troubles would be over.

22:12.620 --> 22:13.951
What kind of troubles
you got, boy?

22:13.960 --> 22:15.496
Same ones as you!

22:15.500 --> 22:16.956
Takin' orders
instead of givin' 'em.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.609
And for what?
Just to make enough

22:18.620 --> 22:20.497
so we can patch her up
and go fish some more?

22:20.500 --> 22:21.876
That's enough.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.166
You don't respect me,
this boat, or this crew.

22:24.170 --> 22:26.206
If you did, you'd know
when to shut up!

22:29.960 --> 22:31.370
-[thud]
-Whoa!

22:32.620 --> 22:33.416
[stopping]

22:37.620 --> 22:38.780
Damn, damn, damn.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.452
-[switches clicking]
-Aw, come on.

23:02.210 --> 23:04.917
[Sean] All right, me and Xander
will go check out the gennie.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.569
Yeah, we'll
keep watch out here.

23:06.580 --> 23:07.911
[Sean
Stay sharp,]guys!

23:15.500 --> 23:17.206
Damn thing's out of juice.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.877
Dad, how come
you were on the boat today?

23:24.250 --> 23:26.491
Your mother and I were...

23:26.500 --> 23:28.286
What?

23:30.080 --> 23:32.617
Your mother and I
have been havin'
some problems.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.532
That's why I was
sleepin' on the boat.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.610
I had no idea.

23:37.620 --> 23:39.952
Well, now you know.

23:39.960 --> 23:44.613
So if you think this boat
is the only thing I care about,

23:44.620 --> 23:46.668
_ it's 'cause
it's the only thing I've got.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.070
[splashes in water]

24:00.080 --> 24:01.456
Uh...

24:01.460 --> 24:03.576
you guys hear that?

24:05.120 --> 24:06.496
I don't hear anything.

24:09.710 --> 24:11.029
Damn it!

24:26.620 --> 24:28.702
-[hissin
-Oh! g]

24:28.710 --> 24:30.200
[Ben] Yeah, now
I definitely heard that.

24:35.710 --> 24:37.610
[whooshing]

24:43.580 --> 24:45.491
I don't see anything!

24:50.040 --> 24:51.610
There's nothing back here!

24:54.500 --> 24:55.706
VVhoa!

24:57.880 --> 24:59.666
-Aah!
-Get down! Get down!

24:59.670 --> 25:01.376
VVhoa!

25:01.380 --> 25:03.496
[Sean] Xander,
fire up the batteries.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.378
-Ho|y--
-What the hell
is that thing?

25:06.380 --> 25:08.530
Spear! There's a spear
in the side of the boat!

25:13.790 --> 25:14.779
[shouting]

25:16.380 --> 25:18.200
Unh!

25:23.080 --> 25:24.286
Aah!

25:27.460 --> 25:29.030
[roaring]

25:29.040 --> 25:30.371
You better get up there.

25:30.380 --> 25:31.449
Dad, I'm
not leaving you down here!

25:31.460 --> 25:33.701
I got this, son! Go!

25:36.830 --> 25:37.819
[hissing]

25:39.250 --> 25:40.569
Damn it!

25:40.580 --> 25:43.413
[growling]

25:49.790 --> 25:51.872
-[Chris] Get him!
-[Calvin] Keep him off!

25:53.170 --> 25:55.707
-[roarin
-Ooh!g]

25:55.710 --> 25:57.496
[Ben] Aah!

25:59.750 --> 26:01.615
[gunshot]

26:05.750 --> 26:06.739
[clicks]

26:06.750 --> 26:07.739
[hisses]

26:10.380 --> 26:11.824
[Chris]
What the hell was that?!

26:11.830 --> 26:13.115
We'll go after that one!

26:13.120 --> 26:14.781
You guys
keep watch up here!

26:14.790 --> 26:16.667
Ben, come on! We're gonna
trap him in the hold!

26:26.460 --> 26:27.575
[Ryn hisses]

26:27.580 --> 26:29.662
It's okay.

26:29.670 --> 26:32.537
What's goin' on, Maddie?

26:32.540 --> 26:35.077
What is this
supposed to prove?

26:35.080 --> 26:37.742
Just watch.

26:37.750 --> 26:40.822
Ryn, we have to show him.

26:49.830 --> 26:52.788
[screaming]

26:52.790 --> 26:54.496
[panﬁng]

27:01.540 --> 27:05.783
[panting and gasping]

27:05.790 --> 27:06.700
I'm sorry.

Look, we should just...

34:35.380 --> 34:37.325
We should just call
the Coast Guard

34:37.330 --> 34:39.537
and explain the situation.

This situation
can't be explained, man.

back in the hospital,

34:45.210 --> 34:46.916

in a padded room.

to tell someone.

that anyone is gonna believe

34:51.920 --> 34:54.491
that Aquaman hopped on board
and stabbed our captain?

one of us did it!

to his knife in time,

35:11.080 --> 35:13.787

35:17.790 --> 35:19.451

just dragged him away.

found anything strange
on the water.

you can't possibly
believe that she's--

38:36.670 --> 38:38.706

38:38.710 --> 38:41.668
Me and my dad,
we had a pact,

38:43.460 --> 38:46.827
and that's something
that shouldn't be broken.

39:03.620 --> 39:06.248
No souls _
were found alive?

39:06.250 --> 39:08.457
No souls
were found at all.

39:08.460 --> 39:10.951
We underestimated them.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.918
This was
a coordinated attack.

If we can't contain
the situation, and fast,

many other casualties
will be on our head?

39:20.420 --> 39:23.492
On your head.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.912
You knew this was
gonna happen, didn't you?

39:25.920 --> 39:28.707
That's why
you called to abort
the whole operation.

39:32.580 --> 39:35.538
We did not underestimate
them, Admiral.

39:35.540 --> 39:36.666
