12:31.917 --> 12:33.127
Thought you weren't coming.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.712
Well, I did.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.341
So, what kind of terrible night
brought you here?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.719
It's honestly not that interesting.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.721
I'm interested.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.725
-Hey, can I get that IPA that's on tap?
-Hey.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.728
-You okay?
-Yeah. No. It's fine.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.774
Nice watch.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.276
It's my grandpa's.

You want to talk about my grandpa?

13:02.907 --> 13:03.783
Why not?

13:06.494 --> 13:07.620
Well, he was great.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.121
He was an artist.

13:09.205 --> 13:12.291
Well, he was a carpenter,
but he always wanted to be an artist.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.669
When I was little, we used to go
to the park and sketch together.

13:18.923 --> 13:19.840

13:56.126 --> 13:57.211
Changed my mind.

13:57.419 --> 14:00.214
What's your excuse?
Glossier having a pop-up sale in the back?

14:01.549 --> 14:02.675
Nice jacket.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.427
You got a drink without a wristband?

14:05.511 --> 14:06.846
Swiped it from some guy.

-Why do you care?

14:24.363 --> 14:27.700
I saw you throwing yourself at Luca.
Albuquerque's obviously into him.

14:27.783 --> 14:28.909
Since when?

14:29.159 --> 14:32.413
Maybe if you paid attention to someone
other than yourself, you'd know.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.508
It's sick. I love it.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.221
So, how do you want to do this?
Cash or Venmo?

in the mirror real quick.

Um, I have a boyfriend.

-Leaving so soon?
-Not soon enough.

Yo! What just happened?

15:52.743 --> 15:54.453
Who was the girl? That was insane.

15:54.536 --> 15:57.998
I was trying to sell my jacket
and I let her try it on and she took off.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.124
I'm so stupid.

Okay, rookie move.
Never trust someone named Gwen.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.632
Wait, were you selling her the jacket
that I gave you?

16:06.715 --> 16:07.633
Rude.

She stole the jacket that you stole?

-Meta.
-Why were you selling that jacket anyway?

16:14.556 --> 16:16.684
I needed the money
for a plane ticket home.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.560
Why are you going home?

16:19.395 --> 16:20.479
For...

16:20.562 --> 16:21.480

It's not stupid.

16:52.886 --> 16:53.804
I just...

16:55.556 --> 16:57.725
I feel so alone here.

Who doesn't?
