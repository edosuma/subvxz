00:55.880 --> 00:57.234
What is this?

00:57.320 --> 01:01.155
My Lord, this man says
he has a message for you
from Ragnar Lothbrok.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.630
Let him go.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.996
What's the message?

01:09.760 --> 01:14.551
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you
to meet him in single combat.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.590
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very
high opinion of himself.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.514
Well, he is
a descendant of Odin.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.360
Ragnar said that
if you refuse his challenge,

01:36.680 --> 01:39.991
then shame would follow you
the rest of your life.

01:40.680 --> 01:44.640
There would be greater
shame in accepting
a challenge from a criminal.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.317
That would suggest
that I take him seriously,

01:47.400 --> 01:49.790
that I see him as an equal.

01:50.560 --> 01:53.029
The challenge is declined.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.316
When Ragnar Lothbrok
appears in Kattegat,

01:55.400 --> 01:57.471
he will be put in chains.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.360
<i>Stones and bones.</i>

02:01.120 --> 02:03.555
He searches for your death.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.635
Does he desire to be Earl?

02:08.360 --> 02:11.751
If he kills you,
would it not be so?

02:18.920 --> 02:21.879
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok
I accept his challenge.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.673
Take him away.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.276
Ragnar.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.395
What?

02:52.880 --> 02:55.190
Let's go away.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.596
Let's leave here.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.912
This is not
the only place for us.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.114
He is old.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.390
What are you
frightened of?

03:08.120 --> 03:10.112
You can't fight.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.111
You're still too weak.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.795
Perhaps that
makes us equal.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.553
Never fight unless you know
the odds are in your favor.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.512
That is our way.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.193
Who sets the odds?

03:40.600 --> 03:43.638
Our fates are
already decided.

03:49.760 --> 03:53.470
You don't believe that,
and neither do I.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.640
You are wrong.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.671
I do believe it.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.752
Come to bed.

04:24.520 --> 04:25.954
You need to rest,
to sleep.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.271
Yes, I will.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.152
There's always
time to sleep.

04:35.280 --> 04:40.150
I was thinking about our boys,
what they would look like now.

04:43.760 --> 04:48.357
Don't. Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.475
When I must kill a man
for whom I have

04:55.080 --> 04:57.231
the utmost respect.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.194
Respect?

05:02.760 --> 05:04.752
You respect
Ragnar Lothbrok?

05:04.840 --> 05:05.830
Why not?

05:06.440 --> 05:10.832
He is what I used to be,
restless, ambitious.

05:13.160 --> 05:16.517
And he was right
about the western lands.

05:16.800 --> 05:20.714
But I always knew
that in my heart.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.751
Then why didn't
you tell him?

05:26.400 --> 05:29.040
Because the moment
that I reached out
to Ragnar Lothbrok

05:29.120 --> 05:32.397
was the moment
that all my friends,
all my supporters

05:32.480 --> 05:35.359
would have deserted
me and joined him.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.795
It was impossible to do it.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.469
But it's true our fates
have brought us together.

05:46.480 --> 05:51.430
And maybe he's opened
the western lands for me.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.792
That is my hope
after I kill him.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.432
The Seer promised
you would kill him?

06:06.640 --> 06:08.074
Yes.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.115
Good.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.073
I'm sure that's
our first child.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.433
Now get up and fetch me
some pickled herrings.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.874
I'm starving.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.159
I don't like the smell
of them in the bed.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.233
Your clothes are
smelly enough as it is.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.277
Why can't you just wash
like everyone else?

06:39.480 --> 06:41.472
I thought a wife
wasn't supposed
to nag her husband

06:41.560 --> 06:44.029
until they'd had time
to grow tired of each other?

06:44.200 --> 06:46.920
If you don't get up
and fetch me some herrings,

06:47.000 --> 06:48.912
I will beat you.

06:49.080 --> 06:52.118
Perhaps that will make you
show a little life when we
have sex in any case.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.795
Very well. I'll go.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.000
I can't wait till tomorrow.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.278
Personal combat is
always thrilling.

07:00.360 --> 07:04.752
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many
people talk about him.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.354
I don't talk about him.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.511
He's my father's enemy.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.550
Ooh...

07:58.320 --> 07:59.754
Lord,

08:01.000 --> 08:02.229
High One,

08:03.600 --> 08:04.590
hear me.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.916
Listen to me.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.594
Give me your favor this day.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.071
Grant me your blessing
as you have done in the past,

08:17.840 --> 08:20.514
and I will make
a sacrifice of my enemy

08:20.600 --> 08:22.910
if his death pleases you.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.591
Give me a sign.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.274
I cannot feel your presence.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.310
Husband.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.870
Our sons' hair.

09:13.280 --> 09:17.479
Believe at least in
them and in yourself.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.309
Don't look so worried.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.712
This is
a personal combat.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.510
The combatants can
choose any weapon and
shield they desire.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.553
Each man has two shields.

10:43.400 --> 10:47.872
If both are broken,
there can be no
further replacement.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.475
Fight, Ragnar!

12:18.640 --> 12:20.757
Father, you can do it!

12:20.840 --> 12:22.957
You can do it, Earl!

12:23.520 --> 12:24.920
Finish him!

12:34.240 --> 12:35.310
He is weak!

14:22.440 --> 14:24.796
Lord Odin is here,

14:27.160 --> 14:32.280
waiting to see which one
of us he will take to
his great hall.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.636
So I shall dine after all

14:41.960 --> 14:44.839
at the high
table of the Aesir.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.472
No! No!

15:01.800 --> 15:02.790
No!

15:16.240 --> 15:20.359
Tonight I shall be
drinking with our boys.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.194
Kill him.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.316
Kill him!

16:33.960 --> 16:35.713
Hail, Earl Ragnar.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.510
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

16:45.600 --> 16:47.478
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

16:47.600 --> 16:49.671
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

16:50.000 --> 16:52.037
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

16:52.440 --> 16:54.318
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

16:54.840 --> 17:04.512
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

17:05.079 --> 17:07.390
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

17:33.760 --> 17:35.672
- Take it!
- Take it!

17:45.080 --> 17:46.116
Take it!

18:03.880 --> 18:05.792
Lord Ragnar,

18:06.880 --> 18:10.430
I have come to swear
to you my allegiance
and fealty

18:10.680 --> 18:13.912
to you and your
family from this day.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.356
Leif, you are my friend.

18:18.800 --> 18:23.477
And you, Torstein,
and you, Arne,
you are my friends.

18:35.800 --> 18:36.950
What is your name?

18:37.200 --> 18:39.237
Tostig, Lord Ragnar.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.789
Do you swear
allegiance and fealty

18:43.840 --> 18:46.719
to me and to my family
from this day forth?

18:47.200 --> 18:48.350
That won't be
so long then.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.036
By my sacred rings,
I swear.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.920
But I also have
a favor to ask, Lord.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.790
What is this favor?

18:59.880 --> 19:03.669
That the next
time you go raiding,
you take me with you.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.835
I do not wish to insult you,
but the truth is you...

19:15.920 --> 19:17.479
That I am too old?

19:19.360 --> 19:22.114
Yes, I am old.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.391
But I have been
a warrior all my life.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.072
Many years I sailed
with Lord Haraldson

19:29.840 --> 19:32.480
and fought battles
against the Eastlanders,

19:33.160 --> 19:37.439
and I watched
all the companions
of my youth die.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.679
And though I fought with
them in the shield-wall,

19:40.880 --> 19:43.475
never once was I
touched by a blade.

19:45.520 --> 19:49.150
All the friends
and companions of
my youth are dead

19:49.440 --> 19:54.276
and feasting and
drinking with the Aesir
in the halls of the gods!

19:55.000 --> 19:56.195
While I,

19:57.400 --> 19:59.437
I am forsaken,

20:01.440 --> 20:02.840
bereft.

20:03.840 --> 20:06.196
Which is why
I beg you, Lord,

20:06.280 --> 20:10.320
gift me the chance
to die with honor
in battle

20:11.120 --> 20:14.318
and join my
friends in Valhalla.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.517
This summer,
we shall have more
ships to go west,

20:34.120 --> 20:35.952
for that is our future.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.830
When we return to England,
let's take him with us.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.630
All in favor?

20:42.880 --> 20:44.200
Aye.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.435
There is no need
for you to swear.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.830
You have already
paid a heavy price
for your loyalty to me.

21:07.480 --> 21:10.598
Nevertheless,
I will swear, brother.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.435
I swear to be true to you,
your wife and your family

21:18.920 --> 21:21.719
as long as your
good fortune holds.

21:26.320 --> 21:29.950
How will we ever be
equal now, my brother?

22:04.520 --> 22:08.355
Why have you agreed
to grant Earl Haraldson
such a big funeral?

22:09.240 --> 22:10.913
Was he not your enemy?

22:12.320 --> 22:13.993
He was also a great man

22:16.760 --> 22:17.750
and warrior.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.560
He earned his
renown in this life,

22:20.640 --> 22:23.633
and now, in death,
he deserves such a funeral.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.437
I want to show
you something.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.356
<i>♪ I dreamt a dream last night</i>

22:45.440 --> 22:48.433
<i>♪ Of silk as fine fur</i>

22:49.520 --> 22:52.718
<i>♪ Now an Earl is
felled by spears</i>

22:52.800 --> 22:56.874
<i>♪ It is horrible
now to look around... ♪</i>

22:58.520 --> 23:00.352
Who is she?

23:01.200 --> 23:02.919
She's one of
the Earl's slaves.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.114
When he died,

23:05.800 --> 23:10.113
all of his slave
women were asked,
"Who wants to die with him?"

23:11.840 --> 23:13.559
This one agreed.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.153
She wants to die?

23:19.280 --> 23:22.990
These other servants
are preparing her.

23:26.360 --> 23:30.195
<i>♪ As the valkyries
sing their song ♪</i>

24:22.200 --> 24:23.714
Put the body on the bench.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.710
Let's make our offerings.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.237
You need
a drink, priest.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.070
Drink.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.593
Drink!

25:44.640 --> 25:48.111
There's that slave girl,
the one who has chosen to die.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.757
What are they doing?

25:56.120 --> 25:58.510
She is having sex with
the men who live in there.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.469
Each one of them
says to her,

26:00.560 --> 26:03.200
"Tell your master
I did this out
of love for him."

26:03.480 --> 26:06.518
Because she will
soon be reunited
with her master in death,

26:06.680 --> 26:08.672
and she will be
able to speak to him.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.840
Silence!

26:46.040 --> 26:48.191
Bjorn, who is that woman?

26:48.480 --> 26:50.517
We call her
the Angel of Death.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.871
I can see my master.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.630
He is in Valhalla.

27:53.760 --> 27:54.750
He calls me.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.597
Let me join him then.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.198
I cannot stay.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.591
What's the matter
with you, priest?

28:08.440 --> 28:09.760
I don't want to watch.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.274
It's only death.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.557
You will stay,
or my father will
hear of it.

28:39.640 --> 28:42.075
Yeah! Yeah!

29:03.320 --> 29:06.518
Hail! Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!

29:14.920 --> 29:16.479
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

29:17.000 --> 29:18.514
Ragnar!

29:21.440 --> 29:23.750
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

29:38.400 --> 29:40.960
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!

29:59.920 --> 30:01.400
Move!

30:12.200 --> 30:14.874
I ask permission
to light the pyre.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.680
I have something important
to tell you, husband.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.832
I am with child again.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.156
I know you're a boy.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.637
The Seer told me.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.397
By all the gods, my son,

32:51.560 --> 32:54.120
you have made me
a happy man.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.793
Have you come to kill us?

33:59.720 --> 34:01.439
Why would I do that?

34:01.680 --> 34:03.797
Because Ragnar
told you to.

34:04.720 --> 34:06.598
It is often
the way that the new Earl

34:06.680 --> 34:08.637
deals with
the family of the old.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.511
Ragnar won't kill you.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.713
How can you be sure?

34:17.679 --> 34:20.239
My brother
doesn't hold grudges.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.312
He's strange that way.

34:29.280 --> 34:33.592
Well, even if
we don't die,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.799
they will still shun
us like a bad smell.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.753
And they'll make it
so we have to leave here,

34:40.840 --> 34:42.433
even though they know
no one else will take us in.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.398
They won't.

34:46.239 --> 34:48.152
Not if I vouch for you.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.440
No one will force
you to go anywhere.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.076
They wouldn't dare.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.038
What do you want
in return?

35:10.640 --> 35:12.871
You were once
married to an Earl.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.838
Would you not
like to be married
to another one?

35:22.880 --> 35:23.870
Who?

35:27.360 --> 35:29.556
What do you mean who?

35:32.400 --> 35:33.720
Me.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.876
The pigs are
fattening nicely.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.232
Just like your mother.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.840
It's cold even in here.

36:34.840 --> 36:38.197
I can't wait for
the spring or the raids.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.237
I want to go to England.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.119
No.

36:46.840 --> 36:48.718
What?
I said no.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.317
But why?
Because I said so.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.038
Don't be too impatient
to put yourself in danger.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.432
But you cannot
alter my fate!

37:01.280 --> 37:03.351
You sound like
your uncle

37:04.200 --> 37:06.510
when he doesn't
know what to say.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.475
Come on.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.880
Ragnar, I have heard
many of your stories,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.834
but tell me,
what is Ragnarök?

37:31.880 --> 37:34.634
I have heard mention
of it several times,

37:35.160 --> 37:37.675
but so far no one
has explained
the meaning to me.

37:39.920 --> 37:44.870
Let's show this
ignorant Christian
what Ragnarök is.

37:48.840 --> 37:49.876
Get the leaves.

38:22.200 --> 38:26.479
The twilight of the gods
will happen like this.

38:26.560 --> 38:29.871
There will be three years
of terrible winters

38:31.680 --> 38:35.833
and summers
of black sunlight.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.600
People will lose all hope

38:42.200 --> 38:46.399
and surrender to greed,
incest and civil war.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.279
Midgardsormen,
the world's serpent,

38:51.400 --> 38:54.313
will come
lunging from the ocean,

38:54.960 --> 38:58.795
dragging the tides in
and flooding the world.

39:01.080 --> 39:04.073
The wolf, giant Fenrir,

39:05.400 --> 39:08.711
will break his
invisible chains.

39:11.480 --> 39:16.509
The skies will open,
and Surt, the fire-giant,

39:16.600 --> 39:20.640
will come flaming
across the bridge
to destroy the gods.

39:21.800 --> 39:25.316
Odin will ride out of
the gates of Valhalla

39:26.320 --> 39:29.597
to do battle for a last
time against the wolf.

39:31.400 --> 39:36.031
Thor will kill the serpent
but die from its venom.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.920
Surt will spread
fire across the earth.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.951
At last, Fenrir

39:46.640 --> 39:48.552
will swallow the sun.

39:48.640 --> 39:50.677
No!

40:32.240 --> 40:35.199
So where did these
Northmen come ashore?

40:35.840 --> 40:38.674
They didn't.
What do you mean,
they didn't?

40:38.880 --> 40:42.715
They came in three ships,
and those ships are now
sailing up the Tyne.

40:49.080 --> 40:54.200
They have ships
that can cross oceans
but also sail up rivers?

40:55.720 --> 40:57.154
What manner of men
are these?

40:57.400 --> 40:58.914
If they are
sailing up the Tyne,

40:59.000 --> 41:01.276
then, sire,
we shall soon find out.

41:02.560 --> 41:05.280
Ah, yes, My Lord Wigea,
of course you know
all about them.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.918
You accused them
of having supernatural powers,

41:10.200 --> 41:13.830
which is why a small force
of them defeated you.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.355
I merely said they
fought like demons,

41:16.440 --> 41:19.239
like men possessed,
with no fear of death.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.514
Unlike you, My Lord?

41:24.040 --> 41:26.714
I fear death as
much as the next man,

41:27.000 --> 41:32.394
but I have no fear
that afterwards God
will raise me up again.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.239
Well said.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.357
Come, all of you!

41:39.120 --> 41:41.874
I have something
new to show you.

41:49.880 --> 41:52.270
Let the serpents
bite these devils.

41:52.640 --> 41:55.712
Let them also bite
those too weak and afraid

41:55.800 --> 41:59.157
to fight to the death
for their king and master.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.835
My Lord! No! No!

42:02.120 --> 42:06.080
You look terrified,
My Lord Wigea.
Have you lost your faith?

42:06.680 --> 42:09.798
Are you not certain anymore
that God will raise
you up from the grave?

42:09.920 --> 42:11.400
Have mercy!

42:11.480 --> 42:13.233
Personally,
I hope he does not.

42:13.360 --> 42:15.113
I hope he leaves
you there to rot.

42:16.720 --> 42:18.393
No!

42:22.440 --> 42:23.874
Lord...

42:30.040 --> 42:32.430
God!

42:35.000 --> 42:38.437
Now, let us prepare
to defend ourselves

42:39.160 --> 42:42.119
against these
heathens and barbarians.
