00:01.200 --> 00:03.498
TERESA: Previously
on Queen of the South...

00:03.670 --> 00:05.626
-BOAZ: Hello?
-Boaz.

00:05.670 --> 00:08.059
-BOAZ: Emilia?
-(speaks Spanish)

00:08.100 --> 00:10.159
S, mi amor.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.359
Emilia?

00:11.410 --> 00:13.207
She missed her flight
from New Orleans.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.629
She called me two days ago.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.569
She told me _
she was coming to MeXIco.

00:18.610 --> 00:21.078
-Haven't heard from Ishmael.
-He's dead.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.485
Do you realize
what you've done?

00:22.520 --> 00:24.181
El Gordo says adios.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.984
It's gonna feel so good
taking her business.

00:29.020 --> 00:30.988
OKSANA: Raul.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.554
You're a liability.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.488
-(silenced gunfire)
-(grunts)

00:34.530 --> 00:35.519
TERESA: Let's get out of here.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.720
She wants to teach you
how to drive.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.692
TONY: Are you kidding?

00:38.730 --> 00:40.994
TERESA: You have to
learn sometime.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.064
-(engine turns over)
-Tony!

00:42.110 --> 00:43.338
(grunts)

00:43.370 --> 00:45.031
(explosion booms)

00:47.640 --> 00:49.676
(engine rewing)

00:49.710 --> 00:51.541
(panﬁng)

00:51.580 --> 00:53.241
Hold on.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.508
What the hell, Teresa?

00:54.550 --> 00:56.188
We're taking a shortcut.

00:56.220 --> 00:57.244
(yells)

00:57.290 --> 00:59.178
I'm getting a contraction.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.380
Ay-yi-yi, it hurts.

01:00.420 --> 01:01.409
You're gonna be okay.

01:01.460 --> 01:02.757
BRENDA: You don't know shit!

01:02.790 --> 01:04.018
You're not the one
With a pInche allen

01:04.060 --> 01:05.425
kicking her uterus!

01:05.460 --> 01:07.121
Breathe, okay?
In, out.

01:12.070 --> 01:13.139
Teresa.

01:13.170 --> 01:14.296
What?

01:14.340 --> 01:15.693
Blood.

01:15.740 --> 01:18.300
-(horn honking)
-(tires screech)

01:18.340 --> 01:20.069
(honking echoes)

01:20.110 --> 01:22.408
(medical device beeping)

01:25.110 --> 01:26.771
How is she, Doctor?

01:26.820 --> 01:28.242
She's stable.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.248
We'_|| know_more when
the brain swelling goes down.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.229
(solemn music)

01:36.260 --> 01:37.386
*

01:37.430 --> 01:38.385
(door clicks shut)

01:38.430 --> 01:40.796
*

01:40.830 --> 01:43.719
Sana, sana colita de rana.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.261
Si no sanas hoy.

01:46.300 --> 01:52.273
*

01:55.310 --> 01:56.470
-Tony!
-(explosion booms)

01:58.480 --> 02:01.449
(dramatic music)

02:01.480 --> 02:07.783
*

02:11.360 --> 02:12.827
(muttering Spanish)

02:12.860 --> 02:17.365
*

02:17.400 --> 02:18.492
What are you doing here?

02:18.530 --> 02:20.259
You're supposed to be
in Mexico.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.700
I heard about la jefa.

02:22.740 --> 02:23.707
Came to help.

02:23.740 --> 02:25.765
*

02:25.810 --> 02:27.277
We don't need your help.

02:27.310 --> 02:32.213
*

02:32.250 --> 02:33.512
Looks like you do.

02:33.550 --> 02:35.211
She's alive, cabrn.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.615
Yeah, but she can't
make decisions.

02:36.650 --> 02:39.448
I'm here.
I can make the decisions.

02:39.490 --> 02:40.787
(chuckles)

02:40.820 --> 02:44.824
Mira, cabrn,
you're a damn good soldier.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.158
But you're no boss.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.451
When you're at war,
a boss has to

02:48.500 --> 02:50.468
make decisions fast.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.639
What are you talking about?

02:52.670 --> 02:55.389
Talking about I'm stopping
all shipments as of today.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.135
Teresa wouldn't want that.

02:57.170 --> 02:58.501
You don't know what
Teresa would want.

02:58.540 --> 03:00.405
And unlike you,

03:00.440 --> 03:03.170
I have experience
running a cartel.

03:03.210 --> 03:04.677
I've been through wars,

03:04.710 --> 03:06.314
and I'm still here,

03:06.350 --> 03:07.419
doing zapateados

03:07.450 --> 03:10.146
on the graves
of my enemies, cabrn.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.715
*

03:12.760 --> 03:15.320
I'll be at Teresa's bar
if anything comes up.

03:15.360 --> 03:19.148
*

03:19.190 --> 03:20.396
Vamos.

03:20.430 --> 03:27.359
*

03:29.870 --> 03:31.360
Well, that didn't look good.

03:31.410 --> 03:33.776
Boaz is trying to take over.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.200
We better watch our backs.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.219
(uneasy music)

03:40.250 --> 03:44.619
*

03:47.220 --> 03:48.357
Hey.

03:48.390 --> 03:50.426
I brought you
a fresh salami sandwich.

03:50.460 --> 03:51.688
Extra salami.

03:51.730 --> 03:53.459
Extra mayonnaise.
Extra delicious.

03:53.500 --> 03:57.197
Could you just please maybe
take a little bite for me?

03:57.230 --> 03:58.299
Thank you.

03:58.330 --> 03:59.638
But I'm not hungry.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.537
You're thinking about Boaz.

04:05.570 --> 04:08.607
There's a reason why Teresa
has him in Sinaloa.

04:10.610 --> 04:12.419
'Cause it's far.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.811
But Teresa runs a tight ship.

04:17.420 --> 04:19.285
What's the worst
he could do here?

04:19.320 --> 04:20.651
(scoffs)

04:20.690 --> 04:23.386
Boaz es un pinche loco.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.887
He shot his own brother
in the head.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.295
What?

04:29.530 --> 04:31.395
Hey, nurse.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.398
I found this piece of glass
in her hair.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.498
That's not acceptable!

04:34.540 --> 04:36.701
-KELLY ANNE: Okay.
-I'm so sorry.

04:38.870 --> 04:39.802
Okay.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.570
Low blood sugar, no bueno.

04:42.610 --> 04:43.907
Please?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.804
-Gracias.
-KELLY ANNE: Mm-hmm.

04:47.550 --> 04:50.519
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

04:50.550 --> 04:51.778
Come in.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.025
I'll let you two catch up.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.857
-Ma'am.
-KELLY ANNE: Mm-hmm.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.596
Just wanted to offer up
any assistance.

05:04.630 --> 05:08.361
I got extra security downstairs
to help keep her safe.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.606
That's okay.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.902
We got it covered.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.439
We insist.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.936
Judge takes this personally.

05:15.980 --> 05:17.868
And we're gonna catch
whoever did this.

05:17.910 --> 05:20.674
Oh, I'm working on it.

05:22.420 --> 05:23.409
Any leads?

05:27.820 --> 05:30.857
No.
I'll let you know.

05:30.890 --> 05:31.959
Do that.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.958
Happy to help.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.367
After all, we're partners.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.332
Partners.

05:44.870 --> 05:45.859
(door opens)

05:54.550 --> 05:55.847
You lost?

05:58.750 --> 06:00.911
I'm an associate of Teresa.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.428
Never heard of you.

06:03.460 --> 06:04.950
And I'm important to Teresa.

06:08.730 --> 06:09.867
Marcel Dumas.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.100
Is she still in the hospital?

06:19.540 --> 06:20.529
Maybe.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.846
Everyone's a bit on edge
after what happened,

06:26.880 --> 06:29.075
and that's--
that's understandable,

06:29.120 --> 06:30.849
but I'm not the enemy here.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.484
Enemies come in all shapes
and sizes.

06:34.660 --> 06:37.629
They even come
claiming to be friends.

06:37.660 --> 06:42.393
*

06:42.430 --> 06:43.624
Look.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.969
I'm not in the mood
for a pissmg contest.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.605
I just came
to get an update on Teresa.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.528
And I already said
I'm not gonna tell you shit.

06:51.570 --> 06:53.538
For all I know, you tried

06:53.580 --> 06:55.377
to have Teresa killed

06:55.410 --> 06:57.549
and you're just here
trying to make sure she's dead.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.548
*

06:59.580 --> 07:00.717
You don't know me, son.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.377
BOAZ: (laughs)

07:02.420 --> 07:04.411
"Son"?

07:04.450 --> 07:06.384
Do I look like a boy, pendejo?

07:06.420 --> 07:07.751
I'm the one who gives orders.

07:07.790 --> 07:09.781
Not in my city.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.980
Not to me.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.657
Even

07:13.700 --> 07:15.395
That a threat?

07:15.430 --> 07:17.762
*

07:17.800 --> 07:19.597
Well, it's not
a dinner invitation.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.733
It's time for you
to leave, cabrn.

07:21.770 --> 07:28.630
*

07:36.050 --> 07:39.019
(blues music playing
over stereo)

07:39.050 --> 07:45.683
*

07:55.800 --> 07:57.961
I'll have what he's having.

07:58.010 --> 08:01.138
You must have balls of steel
to walk up in here like this.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.602
(chuckles softly)

08:02.650 --> 08:04.868
And I'll have balls of steel
when I walk out.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.979
We had a deal.

08:09.020 --> 08:11.443
Judge gets you out on parole,

08:11.490 --> 08:13.708
you kill the Mexican bitch.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.113
Thank you.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.628
*

08:17.660 --> 08:19.958
You didn't hold up your end.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.126
What are you
talking about, man?

08:21.160 --> 08:22.627
I blew her car up.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.820
She wasn't in the car, asshole.

08:26.230 --> 08:27.538
She's alive.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.676
Now, I'm happy
to haul your ass back to jail

08:32.710 --> 08:36.578
as soon as I finish
this shitty whiskey.

08:36.610 --> 08:37.599
Or...

08:39.580 --> 08:41.571
(guns cocking)

08:42.720 --> 08:45.848
You finish what you started.

08:45.890 --> 08:48.859
Kill Teresa Mendoza,
or I'll kill you.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.994
Thanks for stopping by,
Detective.

08:53.030 --> 08:55.521
*

08:55.560 --> 08:56.766
RANDALL: You've got
till end of day.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.960
Get it done.

09:04.210 --> 09:07.600
(device beeping)

09:07.640 --> 09:10.643
(phone vibrating)

09:15.620 --> 09:16.848
Diga.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.950
I heard there was a situation
in New Orleans.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.878
Teresa's in the hospital.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.126
OKSANA: How is she?

09:23.160 --> 09:26.152
POTE: Alive.
But her godson was killed.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.069
El Gordo's people
must be behind this.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.931
Do you know
where his nephew Elias is?

09:32.970 --> 09:34.096
OKSANA: N0.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.062
But I can have my people
look into it.

09:36.100 --> 09:39.263
If Elias came after Teresa,
I could be next.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.130
I need to take precaution.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.579
POTE: That's a good idea.

09:42.610 --> 09:44.202
But I will not let that
stop my busmess.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.945
I need my next shipment, Pote.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.641
Is that understood?

09:47.680 --> 09:49.079
I'll handle it.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.644
Good.

09:50.690 --> 09:51.679
Let's go.

09:55.660 --> 09:58.652
(Boaz speaking Spanish)

10:02.100 --> 10:03.727
-MAN: Jefe.
-MAN: Salud.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.761
(dance music playing
over stereo)

10:05.800 --> 10:07.062
(phone vibrating)

10:07.100 --> 10:08.089
(speaks Spanish)

10:09.870 --> 10:12.873
(speaking Spanish)

10:14.110 --> 10:15.134
POTE: Chicho.

10:15.180 --> 10:18.741
Can I trust you
to keep your mouth shut?

10:18.780 --> 10:19.815
What I'm gonna ask you to do,

10:19.850 --> 10:22.739
Boaz cannot know about it.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.916
Clara.

10:23.950 --> 10:27.249
I need you to take a shipment
to Atlanta today.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.110
I'm counting on you.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.149
I got it.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.019
I need y'all.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.769
(suspenseful music)

11:03.930 --> 11:04.385
The room is spinning.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.151
Why does it feel like
a pinche hot tub in here?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.861
Teresa, I-I need
a bucket of ice, please.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.197
I feel like the bruja

11:11.230 --> 11:12.663
from The Wizard of Oz,
like I'm melting--please.

11:12.700 --> 11:15.635
-Please just do it.
-I'll be right back.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.900
(panﬁng)

11:17.940 --> 11:20.329
Excuse me, Doctor?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.132
That's my friend over there.

11:22.180 --> 11:23.306
What's wrong with her?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.807
Well, your friend's
blood pressure is very high.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.375
She has something
called preeclampsia.

11:28.420 --> 11:31.412
(speaking Spanish)

11:33.420 --> 11:35.354
TERESA: What if you can't?

11:35.390 --> 11:37.028
DOCTOR LOZA:
If her condition worsens,

11:37.060 --> 11:38.721
then her life
will be in danger.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.159
We will have to deliver
the baby,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.691
but, uh, his lungs
are not mature enough.

11:46.770 --> 11:48.067
When will her husband arrive?

11:48.100 --> 11:50.000
He may have to make
some medical decisions.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.099

11:52.140 --> 11:53.334
He's working.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.733
*

12:02.720 --> 12:09.387
*

12:16.130 --> 12:18.166
I'm so sorry about Tony.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.263
Despite everything
that happened,

12:25.310 --> 12:27.437
I know he loved you so much.

12:32.410 --> 12:37.245
*

12:37.290 --> 12:38.939
I keep thinking
that he's going to walk

12:38.990 --> 12:42.380
through those doors
any minute now.

12:42.420 --> 12:45.389
KELLY AN_NE: I know.
(snIffles)

12:45.430 --> 12:47.227
(sobs quietly)

12:47.260 --> 12:51.264
I keep thinking we're gonna see
him sitting over there,

12:51.300 --> 12:56.738
so serious,
working on his sketchpad.

12:56.770 --> 13:01.400
*

13:01.440 --> 13:02.941
I think I need a minute.

13:04.980 --> 13:10.987
*

13:14.960 --> 13:16.450
The warehouse is secure.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.121
Did you know that Boaz
was coming to town?

13:24.230 --> 13:25.959
Are you two planning something?

13:26.000 --> 13:29.231
Man, if Boaz is here,
he didn't call me.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.300
He came on his own.
Now, que pasa?

13:32.340 --> 13:34.808
Well, your cousin thinks
that he's in charge now.

13:36.210 --> 13:39.202
Maybe he's just trying to help.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.979
"Help," that's what he said.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.271
But I don't trust him.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.947
He stopped all our shipments.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.481
He has men at the bar.
You know how that looks?

13:46.520 --> 13:48.488
Okay, okay, let me talk to him.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.854
Dumas.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.492
Pote.

13:54.530 --> 13:55.997
Javier.

14:03.340 --> 14:04.864
I haven't known Teresa
for a long time,

14:04.910 --> 14:07.037
but I know she's a fighter.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.502
She'll get through it.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.837
Thank you.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.041
Any word on who's responsible?

14:14.550 --> 14:17.018
We think it was El Gordo's men.

14:18.850 --> 14:20.283
I met a guy at your bar today.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.848
He left a bad taste
in my mouth.

14:23.890 --> 14:25.926
Let me guess.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.929
He was wearing a big
black cowboy hat?

14:28.960 --> 14:30.325
And running his mouth?

14:30.370 --> 14:33.533
DUMAS: He even accused me
of trying to kill Teresa.

14:33.570 --> 14:35.492
POTE: That's Boaz.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.462
He runs Sinaloa for us.

14:39.110 --> 14:40.577
Well, he seems like a guy
who's been waiting

14:40.610 --> 14:42.430
for his turn at the throne.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.848
Maybe he hit your boss.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.370
(dramatic music)

14:48.420 --> 14:50.513
Be careful who you accuse.

14:50.550 --> 14:52.882
(sighs)
He's my cousin.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.353
No offense.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.187
Family is family.

14:56.220 --> 14:57.881
But a guy like that?

14:57.930 --> 14:59.522
I know
what you're trying to do.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.289
(speaking Spanish)

15:01.330 --> 15:04.322
(speaking Spanish)

15:10.070 --> 15:13.403
*

15:13.440 --> 15:16.238
Sorry about that.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.908
It's a family full of hotheads.

15:18.950 --> 15:20.076
It's okay.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.212
I get it.

15:21.250 --> 15:24.913
Javier's just defending
his cousin.

15:24.950 --> 15:27.054
The guy I met today,

15:27.090 --> 15:29.308
he's hungry.

15:29.360 --> 15:33.091
You need to eliminate that
threat before he gets allies.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.893
A hit on Boaz?

15:34.930 --> 15:38.229
*

15:38.270 --> 15:39.498
Teresa wouldn't approve
of that.

15:39.530 --> 15:42.931
Well, I doubt she would want
him sitting in her place.

15:42.970 --> 15:45.109
A guy who doesn't play
by her rules.

15:46.510 --> 15:50.276
*

15:50.310 --> 15:52.301
I don't envy you.

15:52.350 --> 15:53.578
You want to make
the same deCISIons

15:53.620 --> 15:56.077
you think Teresa would.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.588
There's no way of knowing
what's in her head.

15:58.620 --> 16:02.158
You call the shots now, Pote.

16:02.190 --> 16:04.920
I can make a move, quick.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.120
You just give me
the green light.

16:06.160 --> 16:13.066
*

16:30.490 --> 16:32.446
-(gasps)
-Don't scream.

16:32.490 --> 16:38.486
*

16:43.370 --> 16:44.997
Boaz Jimenez!

16:48.340 --> 16:50.137
I was wondering
when you were going to show

16:50.170 --> 16:52.604
your putito face, mazapn.

16:57.110 --> 16:58.441
JAVIER: We need
to talk, primo.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.047
Yeah.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.377
Yeah, we need to talk.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.012
We need to talk about Emilia.

17:04.050 --> 17:05.642
-(grunts)
-Hmm?

17:05.690 --> 17:08.682
*

17:14.400 --> 17:17.267
Javier's not answering
his phone.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.167
Maybe he just needs
some time to cool off.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.998
I don't know who
to trust anymore.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.600
Dumas. Boaz.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.278
Javier.

17:27.310 --> 17:28.538
Trust Teresa.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.378
She works with those men
for a reason.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.376
Even Boaz?

17:37.050 --> 17:38.688
Even Boaz brings something
to the table

17:38.720 --> 17:41.052
or Teresa would have
nothing to do with him.

17:44.460 --> 17:47.452
(engine rewing)

17:57.070 --> 17:59.709
(dramatic music)

17:59.740 --> 18:01.332
(horn honks)

18:04.410 --> 18:05.741
(grunts)

18:05.780 --> 18:08.214
*

18:08.250 --> 18:09.239
Watch it!

18:12.420 --> 18:14.752
(gunfire)

18:18.130 --> 18:20.325
(tire hissing)

18:25.630 --> 18:27.268
(grunts)

18:35.780 --> 18:36.769
MAN: (screams)

18:55.130 --> 18:58.668

18:58.700 --> 19:00.691
This is for my to.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.799
(speaks Spanish)

19:18.350 --> 19:21.319
(woman speaking Spanish
over PA)

19:23.590 --> 19:25.421
I'm scared, Teresa.

19:26.890 --> 19:29.529
You and the baby will be fine.

19:29.560 --> 19:34.190
*

19:34.240 --> 19:37.232
I haven't prayed
since we got to the hospital.

19:37.270 --> 19:39.409
And I made a deal with God.

19:39.440 --> 19:43.809
*

19:43.850 --> 19:47.570
If by some miracle,
Tony and I make it...

19:47.620 --> 19:50.714
and Chino comes home safe,
I'm getting out.

19:50.750 --> 19:53.514
No more pinche narco life
for me.

19:53.560 --> 19:57.553
We'll take Tony somewhere
quiet and safe.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.524
(sighs)

19:59.560 --> 20:01.699
That sounds nice, doesn't it?

20:01.730 --> 20:04.369
*

20:04.400 --> 20:05.867
It does.

20:05.900 --> 20:09.392
*

20:09.440 --> 20:11.362
You think Chino
will listen to me?

20:13.210 --> 20:15.576
*

20:15.610 --> 20:16.599
He will.

20:17.810 --> 20:21.246
*

20:21.280 --> 20:23.248
I'm gonna make
a phone call, okay?

20:23.290 --> 20:24.279
I'll be right back.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.709
Guero, it's me.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.352
Things are bad at the hospital.

20:29.390 --> 20:30.584
Chino needs to be here.

20:30.630 --> 20:31.585
Call me.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.359
Teresa, hey.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.254
Oh, my God.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.358
Are you okay?

20:36.400 --> 20:37.367
Are you hurt?

20:37.400 --> 20:38.560
No. No, no, no, no.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.465
What happened?
Where's--where's Chino?

20:40.500 --> 20:43.230
What're you talking about?
You mean he's not here?

20:43.270 --> 20:45.306
No!
What happened to you guys?

20:45.340 --> 20:47.399
*

20:47.440 --> 20:50.204
We were on a run.
We got ambushed by federales.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.241
Oh, my God.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.249
It was--it was bad.
We lost some people.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.474
Me and Chino,
we had to split up.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.613
I haven't been able
to get ahold of him.

20:57.650 --> 20:59.288
I was hoping he was here.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.254
What's--what's--
what's going on with the baby?

21:01.290 --> 21:02.712
Brenda's having complications.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.320
Chino needs to be here.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.248
All right, just let me--
let me keep making some calls,

21:07.300 --> 21:08.551
see if I can track him down.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.761
What do I tell her?

21:11.770 --> 21:13.328
Don't tell her anything.
All right?

21:13.370 --> 21:14.837
Don't even tell her I'm here.
Just, she needs you right now.

21:14.870 --> 21:17.259
Go back in there and tell her
everything's okay.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.663
Okay.

21:18.710 --> 21:19.734
Just let a doctor see you.

21:19.770 --> 21:21.306
Okay. I'm fine.
I'm fine, all right?

21:21.340 --> 21:22.637
Just go.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.671
*

21:24.710 --> 21:25.677
(sighs)

21:25.710 --> 21:32.616
*

21:34.520 --> 21:37.523
(phone line ringing)

21:43.570 --> 21:44.923
POTE: Come on, cabrn.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.028
Pick up.

21:47.700 --> 21:48.689
(groans)

21:50.000 --> 21:52.730
-Javier didn't answer?
-No.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.270
I think he left the hospital.

21:56.310 --> 21:57.777
And Chicho's
not answering either.

21:57.810 --> 21:58.777
Try Boaz.

21:58.810 --> 22:00.346
Maybe him and Javier
are together

22:00.380 --> 22:02.610
working things out, you know,
like, cousin-to-cousin.

22:02.650 --> 22:03.844
That's not happening.

22:05.020 --> 22:07.955
(grunting)

22:07.990 --> 22:10.015
-Emilia called me.
-JAVIER: (grunts)

22:10.060 --> 22:12.278
She was coming back to Mexico.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.525
We were gonna
get back together.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.391
But she never showed up.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.019
And you lied to me!

22:20.570 --> 22:23.505
You were hiding Emilia here
this whole time!

22:23.540 --> 22:25.861
You found out she wanted
to get back together with me.

22:25.910 --> 22:28.879
You don't want me to have her,
so you killed her.

22:28.910 --> 22:31.299
(grunting)

22:31.350 --> 22:33.045
-Where is she?
-(groans)

22:33.080 --> 22:34.377
Where did you bury her body?

22:34.420 --> 22:36.479
(speaks Spanish)

22:36.520 --> 22:38.579
I don't know where she is.

22:38.620 --> 22:40.554
I didn't do anything to her.

22:40.590 --> 22:42.911
*

22:42.960 --> 22:44.382
If you lie to me once,

22:44.430 --> 22:46.318
it's your fault, pendejo.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.351
But nobody lies to me twice.

22:50.060 --> 22:51.061
(gun cocks)

22:52.530 --> 22:58.537
*

22:58.570 --> 23:00.003
She alone in there?

23:00.040 --> 23:01.337
No.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.335
There's two guys by the door

23:02.380 --> 23:04.871
of the ICU
and two at her bedside.

23:04.910 --> 23:06.707
Just stick to the plan.

23:06.750 --> 23:09.878
Nobody ever suspects the nurse.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.945
*

23:11.990 --> 23:13.048
What are you gonna do with her?

23:13.090 --> 23:14.512
Don't worry about her.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.357
Just worry about the woman
inside we gotta kill.

23:27.770 --> 23:28.668
Her last MRI showed
that her brain swelling

23:29.670 --> 23:31.103
has gone down considerably.

23:31.140 --> 23:32.562
That's good news, right?

23:32.610 --> 23:35.477
And I have decided
to take her off the sedation.

23:35.510 --> 23:37.978
Now, the next 24 hours
are going to be critical.

23:38.010 --> 23:39.375
What does that mean?

23:39.410 --> 23:40.809
She gonna wake up soon?

23:40.850 --> 23:42.374
Well, it's hard to predict.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.388
Some patients wake up
relatively quickly.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.717
It's really up to her

23:45.750 --> 23:47.809
and how fast she can recover
from the drugs.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.509
I need her to wake up now!

23:52.430 --> 23:54.398
I know this is upsetting.

23:54.430 --> 23:56.990
But as I said,
it's really up to her.

23:57.030 --> 23:59.396
We've done everything
that we can.

23:59.430 --> 24:00.738
Of course, thank you so much.

24:00.770 --> 24:03.136
I'm sorry, we're just--
this is hard.

24:03.170 --> 24:04.398
We're emotional.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.759
DOCTOR GALEN: Yeah.
No worrIes.

24:05.810 --> 24:07.573
I'll let you know
if there are any other updates.

24:07.610 --> 24:09.475
-KELLY ANNE: Thank you.
-DOCT OR GALEN: Mm-hmm.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.477
What is wrong with you?

24:13.520 --> 24:16.409
How could it be up to Teresa
to wake up, huh?

24:16.450 --> 24:17.644
She's the doctor.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.612
This isn't her fault
that this happened.

24:19.650 --> 24:21.618
No. It's mine.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.758
She trusted me with her life.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.449
And I failed her.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.562
KELLY ANNE: Hey.

24:37.640 --> 24:38.800
Hey.

24:39.810 --> 24:41.129
You didn't fail her.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.774
Okay, you didn't.

24:43.810 --> 24:46.643
But she needs you now
more than ever.

24:49.480 --> 24:56.181
*

25:09.070 --> 25:15.999
*

25:21.520 --> 25:24.512
(phone vibrating)

25:29.190 --> 25:31.681
Where is my shipment?

25:31.730 --> 25:34.699
*

25:34.730 --> 25:36.652
I sent someone to handle it.

25:36.700 --> 25:37.598
He didn't show?

25:37.630 --> 25:39.495
What is going on over there?

25:39.530 --> 25:41.066
Teresa would never
let this happen.

25:41.100 --> 25:44.501
Do I need to send my men down
there to run things?

25:44.540 --> 25:46.838
Because you obviously
can't do it.

25:46.870 --> 25:47.905
*

25:47.940 --> 25:49.828
No.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.199
I'll make some calls.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.070
You better.

25:53.110 --> 25:54.941
*

25:54.980 --> 25:57.517
(phone line ringing)

25:57.550 --> 25:58.517
(line beeps)

25:58.550 --> 25:59.517
Chicho.

25:59.550 --> 26:00.517
Where are you, cabrn?

26:00.550 --> 26:02.518
Give me a call.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.118
(mutters Spanish)

26:04.160 --> 26:05.582
Come on, pick up, Javier.

26:05.630 --> 26:06.858
JAVIER: (speaking Spanish)

26:06.890 --> 26:08.824
(groans)
Cabrn.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.518
You okay?

26:11.570 --> 26:15.688
I always thought that one day
I'll take a bullet for her.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.004
But I never thought
that I would take her place.

26:20.310 --> 26:23.131
I'm sorry, did something happen
while I was sleeping?

26:23.180 --> 26:25.569
Oksana did not get
her shipment.

26:27.250 --> 26:30.617
And Chicho's
not answering the phone.

26:30.650 --> 26:32.083
Neither is Javier.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.281
You mean
Boaz found out about it?

26:34.320 --> 26:35.252
Maybe.

26:35.290 --> 26:37.053
He's crazy enough
to kill Chicho

26:37.090 --> 26:39.627
and tank the shipment
just to make a point.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.894
I just don't know what to do.

26:47.940 --> 26:48.998
Okay.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.304
Okay, let's try this, just...

26:51.340 --> 26:55.629
try and quiet your mind
and just breathe for a second.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.917
I'm not a hippie.

27:04.950 --> 27:06.747
(laughs)
No.

27:06.790 --> 27:09.816
No, no, my AA sponsor
taught me all about this.

27:09.860 --> 27:14.820
So she said, inside of me
is an impenetrable refuge,

27:14.860 --> 27:17.158
and it's the safest place
in the whole world,

27:17.200 --> 27:19.691
so if I could just learn
to quiet my brain

27:19.730 --> 27:21.789
and my fears and my ego,

27:21.840 --> 27:24.764
then all the answers
will come to the surface.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.165
(speaks Spanish)

27:27.210 --> 27:29.337
I cannot keep sitting around
doing nothing.

27:35.650 --> 27:37.311
I need to make a decision.

27:39.990 --> 27:43.289
What I'm saying is,
tune the noise out

27:43.320 --> 27:45.026
and go with your gut.

27:45.060 --> 27:46.823
It's gotten you this far.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.829
Maybe I could try
reasoning with Boaz.

27:52.870 --> 27:54.963
Like Teresa would.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.331
KELLY ANNE: Yeah.

28:02.110 --> 28:03.634
No one can do that.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.840
Not even his family.

28:05.850 --> 28:11.789
*

28:16.220 --> 28:19.223
(phone line ringing)

28:21.200 --> 28:22.349
DUMAS: Pote.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.719
Hey.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.726
Is the offer
still on the table?

28:25.770 --> 28:27.362
Say the word.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.095
POTE: Put your men in place.

28:29.140 --> 28:32.837
*

28:40.980 --> 28:41.617

WOMAN: (speaking Spanish)

28:53.390 --> 28:54.857
Hey.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.869
I want you to choose Tony.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.697
What do you mean?

28:59.730 --> 29:01.732
If you have to choose
between me and Tony,

29:01.770 --> 29:03.260
let Tony live.

29:03.300 --> 29:06.963
You are both going to make it.

29:07.010 --> 29:10.434
I've made every bad choice
in the world.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.948
He deserves a shot at life.

29:12.980 --> 29:16.074
We are growing old
together, okay?

29:18.850 --> 29:20.283
Okay.

29:21.490 --> 29:23.754
You and me.

29:23.790 --> 29:25.087
(speaks Spanish)

29:25.130 --> 29:27.052

29:27.090 --> 29:28.398
Dentures.

29:28.430 --> 29:30.091
-(chuckles softly)
-BRENDA: Lots of naps.

29:30.130 --> 29:31.165
And tequila.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.760
All the reposado
in the world.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.234
(chuckles)

29:36.270 --> 29:37.168
Tequila...

29:41.010 --> 29:42.432
Brenda?

Doctor!

She's having a seizure.

29:47.450 --> 29:49.418
Push 4 grams magnesium sulfate.

29:49.450 --> 29:50.849
WOMAN: S, Doctor.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.084
What?
I'm coming with her.

29:56.120 --> 29:57.417
I'm coming with her!

29:57.460 --> 29:59.155

Excuse me.

30:15.010 --> 30:16.932
*

30:16.980 --> 30:18.447
Don't mean to bother you.

30:18.480 --> 30:21.119
Just made a hot cup of tea
for your friend in there.

30:21.150 --> 30:22.811
Thought he could use
something comforting.

30:22.850 --> 30:24.943
Thank you.
That was so sweet of you.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.014
You're welcome.

30:26.050 --> 30:27.859
(phone line ringing)

30:27.890 --> 30:30.313
You get ahold of anyone?

30:30.360 --> 30:32.385
No.

30:32.430 --> 30:35.888
Well, the cute nurse out there
just made you a cup of tea.

30:35.930 --> 30:37.329

30:37.360 --> 30:38.361
Go ahead, take a sip.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.526
Don't be rude.

30:39.570 --> 30:41.868
I think she has a crush on you.

Mmm.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.205
Chamomile.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.207
My favorite.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.174
Oh, is it?
Well, don't worry.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.474
I'll get my own
from the coffee machine.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.338
I don't believe anything
that comes out of your mouth.

31:14.370 --> 31:16.861
I sent Emilia away
for her own safety.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.828
Why would Emilia be in danger?

31:20.870 --> 31:22.929
-Hmm?
-(grunts)

31:25.280 --> 31:28.875

31:28.920 --> 31:31.218
I thought the police
were about to catch me...

31:32.990 --> 31:35.379
*

31:35.420 --> 31:38.389
After killing those two
cabrns we left in the swamp.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.921
*

31:40.960 --> 31:44.396
I explained to Emilia
the situation,

31:44.430 --> 31:46.364
and she left for good.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.891
I never heard from her again.

But if she
called you, primo...

31:54.410 --> 31:58.403

She ran away from both of us.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.218

She's better off
without us, primo.

This is no life for Emilia.

Never was.

-I'm calling it off.
-What?

39:39.870 --> 39:41.337
We're almost at the bar.

39:41.370 --> 39:43.076
Boaz will be blindsided.

39:43.110 --> 39:46.568
*

39:46.610 --> 39:48.669
Teresa's awake.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.574
I have to get back to her.

39:52.550 --> 39:54.950
(tender music)

39:54.990 --> 39:58.380
*

39:58.430 --> 39:59.454
Hey.

40:00.830 --> 40:01.797
How's she doing?

40:01.830 --> 40:02.899
She's gonna make it.

40:02.930 --> 40:05.524
Yeah? What about the baby?

40:05.570 --> 40:06.696
The doctor said he needs

40:06.730 --> 40:08.095
to keep an eye on him
for a few days,

40:08.130 --> 40:10.564
but he thinks
he's gonna be okay.

40:15.510 --> 40:16.534
Did you find Chino?

40:16.580 --> 40:17.877
No.

40:17.910 --> 40:19.844
He's--he's gonna be fine.

40:20.950 --> 40:22.577
We've been through worse.

40:23.750 --> 40:27.049
What happened today, to Brenda,

40:27.090 --> 40:30.116
I don't want to ever
be in that position.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.889
You asking me to walk away
from this life?

40:31.930 --> 40:34.751
I'm asking you to never
put me in that position.

40:34.800 --> 40:38.054
*

40:38.100 --> 40:40.921
I don't want to lose you.

40:40.970 --> 40:43.495
I won't ever do that to you.

40:43.540 --> 40:45.064
All right?

40:45.110 --> 40:46.634
I promise.

40:46.670 --> 40:53.599
*

40:58.120 --> 41:00.145
She's naming the baby Tony.

41:00.190 --> 41:02.408
Yeah, after her dad?

41:02.460 --> 41:03.654
Tony Montana.

41:03.690 --> 41:06.682
(both laugh)

41:06.730 --> 41:08.493
Oh, that's fitting.

41:10.730 --> 41:12.493
Maybe not.

41:12.530 --> 41:14.464
Maybe she'll keep her promise.

41:16.170 --> 41:23.076
*

41:26.480 --> 41:29.472
(singer vocalizing)

41:30.480 --> 41:37.181
*

41:44.000 --> 41:45.968
We're going to kill them all.

41:54.580 --> 41:54.932
(ethereal music)

41:57.540 --> 42:04.241
*

42:06.850 --> 42:07.817
(projector clicking)

42:07.850 --> 42:10.853
(keys clacking, bell dings)
