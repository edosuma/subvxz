<i>There's a magic that
happens when you dance.</i>

00:27.236 --> 00:30.347
<i>Everything lines up.
The world is in sync.</i>

00:30.447 --> 00:35.832
<i>And for one perfect moment,
you feel totally alive.</i>

00:36.954 --> 00:38.564
<i>But to make a living as a dancer</i>

00:38.664 --> 00:41.483
<i>you go through stuff that
doesn't feel so magical.</i>

00:41.583 --> 00:43.235
<i>The rejection.</i>

00:43.335 --> 00:44.695
<i>Crappy pay.</i>

00:44.795 --> 00:46.697
<i>Endless auditions.</i>

00:46.797 --> 00:48.198
<i>That's when it feels like your world</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:50.409
<i>shrinks down to the same cold room.</i>

00:50.509 --> 00:54.288
<i>The same fluorescent lights
and the same indifferent people</i>

00:57.516 --> 00:59.626
<i>That's where my
Hollywood story begins.</i>

00:59.726 --> 01:02.296
All right, thanks
for coming in today.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.547
Uh, you guys know everybody here.

01:03.647 --> 01:05.257
Can you take off, um...

01:05.357 --> 01:06.800
Take your shirts off.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.510
Yeah, just take your shirts off.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.157
Oh, yeah, no shirts.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.727
Good. That's good.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.499
That's good.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.357
That's great. Can you come forward?

02:03.457 --> 02:04.942
And go backwards.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.652
Can you just step
to your left, please?

02:06.752 --> 02:08.362
Just find the light to your left.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.839
But as you're going left,
you need to go right.

02:19.723 --> 02:24.148
I want you to feel the feeling
of feeling the product.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.023
Good. And use the product.

02:33.403 --> 02:37.683
I just want the feeling that
your hose is your family.

02:37.783 --> 02:41.103
And I want you to,
um, make love to it.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.205
- Oh.
- But not in a weird way.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.255
- That's good.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.101
Good. More, more!

03:05.811 --> 03:07.608
Less, less!

03:10.273 --> 03:12.009
Yeah, I wasn't expecting a beard.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.093
I like the beard.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.178
No, we need the beard to go.
Beard's gotta go.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.139
- Beard's not going.
- The beard should go now.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.348
Are you willing to shave your beard?

03:18.448 --> 03:19.766
Yeah, I'll shave it off. Absolutely.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.810
- You'll shave? He'll shave.
- Yeah.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.502
- Yeah.
- Come on, please?

03:31.294 --> 03:33.046
Thank you.

03:37.426 --> 03:40.145
This is not working.

03:48.812 --> 03:52.486
What are you doin?
What's wrong with you?

03:53.734 --> 03:56.703
- Mmm.
- Oh. That's nice.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.867
Hey!

03:59.740 --> 04:01.099
You gonna let her walk
past you like that?

04:01.199 --> 04:03.018
Yeah, exactly what was that?

04:03.118 --> 04:05.520
Dawg, you gotta move on.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.121
Huh?

04:07.622 --> 04:10.671
Emily's on tour.
All right? It's over.

04:11.209 --> 04:14.738
Hot girl looks at you like that,
man, you gotta handle it.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.322
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know better than that.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.075
I know how I'd handle it.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.202
Sorry, everyone, looks like we
found what we're looking for

04:21.303 --> 04:23.747
and we're out of time for
today, so thanks again.

04:23.847 --> 04:27.250
Are you serious? Come on.
We've been out here for three hours.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.752
That's how it goes.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.253
Thank you so much, Elizabeth.
Appreciate it.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.588
Always a pleasure, Jasper.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.423
Yes, it is.

04:34.123 --> 04:35.696
Nice hats.

04:37.486 --> 04:38.987
<i>Ole.</i>

04:40.155 --> 04:41.656
<i>Ole?</i>

04:42.532 --> 04:44.033
Shit.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.936
Bad. That was bad.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.521
I don't get it.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.564
I actually had a good
feeling about this one.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.650
Yeah. That one, and the one before,

04:51.750 --> 04:54.277
and all the other ones
that we didn't get.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.321
Yeah, I thought LA was supposed to be

04:56.421 --> 04:58.573
the place where dreams
actually happen.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.534
No, what actually happens is that

05:00.634 --> 05:03.036
we keep putting on this
stupid shit for nothing.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.747
Where did you find these anyway?
Actually, I don't wanna know.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.457
In the dumpster behind El Compadre.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.544
It's called vintage, boo.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.129
Y'all act like we can
afford new ones.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.296
No, that's called nasty.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.673
- That's gross.
- Honestly, I can't take this anymore.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.007
I really can't. You know?

05:16.107 --> 05:19.720
All right. Let's just chalk this
up as another crappy audition.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.389
Every audition is a crappy audition.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.099
I thought we were on our way.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.977
We move out here. We do the big
Nike ad. Everything's looking good.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.854
And then nothing.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.440
I hate to say it, but what
are we still doing here?

05:31.540 --> 05:33.525
I feel you, bro.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.819
Okay, it's been rough.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.966
We gotta blow off some steam.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.473
I know what we need.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.791
Yo, The Mob is in the house, y'all!

05:49.891 --> 05:50.834
What's up, Sean?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.711
Brother, how you doin', man?

05:52.811 --> 05:54.504
Oh, my man!

05:54.604 --> 05:57.591
That's my man. How you
feelin', man? All right?

05:57.691 --> 05:58.759
How many of y'all tonight?

05:58.859 --> 05:59.843
The whole Mob.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.178
Y'all always roam in packs, though.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.430
I don't know why you gotta
do that to a brother.

06:03.530 --> 06:06.124
Told you, this is what we needed.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.519
Let's have a good night, y'all.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.245
Oh. What the...

06:11.830 --> 06:15.025
Hey! It's the mariachi
band from earlier.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.943
You ladies play us something saucy?

06:17.043 --> 06:20.888
That's cute. That necklace is cute,
too. You get that at Claire's?

06:21.131 --> 06:22.991
Man, you spend all day
comin' up with that?

06:23.091 --> 06:25.660
You musta had a lotta free
time after not getting that gig.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.204
Whatever, man, just get outta here.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.330
We're just tryin' to
have a good time.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.581
Man, we ain't goin' nowhere.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.874
We came here to do a little dancin'.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.125
Unless that's a problem for you.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.127
It is. So go.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.546
Maybe we should settle it.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.715
You wanna battle on the floor?

06:38.815 --> 06:41.134
Please, let's not do it, all right?
Are we really doing this?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.219
Right. Listen, please.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.679
This guy's a douche, man. And I'm
not tryin' to get all sweaty in this.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.056
Battling him is not the move.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.516
Look, what's the problem?

06:47.616 --> 06:50.018
Did the three amigos
forget their sombreros?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.520
Mexican reference? Good job, man.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.021
This guy's a dick.
Come on. Let's just go.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.064
No, no.

06:54.164 --> 06:57.543
You picked the wrong night
to get in my face, little man.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.277
Are you having a tough day?

06:59.377 --> 07:01.071
It must suck to be
hot for five minutes,

07:01.171 --> 07:04.241
then realize that your flash
mob ain't nothin' but a joke.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.742
Whatever, man, you're a joke!

07:05.842 --> 07:08.245
Okay, yeah, we got that.
That's awesome. Thank you, man.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.621
Look, we've been there and done that.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.748
Let this go. Let's just go.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.543
No, we came here to dance, right?

07:14.643 --> 07:18.272
Why don't we line it up for
these clowns. Come on, let's go.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.048
Come on.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.880
Whoo!

08:56.953 --> 08:58.454
Oh!

10:35.468 --> 10:36.969
Yo!

10:39.264 --> 10:40.765
Aah!

11:33.109 --> 11:36.954
Grim Knights! Grim Knights!
Grim Knights!

11:38.531 --> 11:42.519
That's the last time I make a fool
out of myself for you. That's it.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.871
Way to look out for
the crew, bro. Thanks, man.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.082
I'm outta here.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.947
Hey, man, easy come, easy go, bro.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.471
If everybody could make it,
it wouldn't be Hollywood.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.090
- What time was lunch?
- Like 2:30.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.550
There you are, man.

12:55.650 --> 12:56.968
What is this?

12:57.068 --> 12:58.928
Look, we been talkin' about it, man,

12:59.028 --> 13:01.806
and it's time to go home, Sean.

13:01.906 --> 13:05.660
I mean, we've gone hard.
And it's nothing to be ashamed of.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.084
Then what? You're just gonna bail?

13:09.539 --> 13:10.940
All of you?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.442
Yo, man, wake up, man!

13:12.542 --> 13:15.570
When are you gonna stop acting
like everything is just okay?

13:15.670 --> 13:17.989
This crew's not ready for LA, man.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.741
I don't know how you don't see that.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.785
Because we made 50
grand off the Nike spot.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.287
Yeah. Six months ago.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.080
And split 12 ways.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.458
Dawg, I spend more money
on gas going to auditions

13:28.558 --> 13:29.709
than most people do on rent.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.279
I'm over it. I'm done, man.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.798
So what are you gonna do?

13:35.898 --> 13:37.399
Hmm?

13:38.067 --> 13:40.303
You gonna go back to Miami?

13:40.403 --> 13:42.722
We're just all tapped out, man.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.974
Dude, we're 40 days late on our rent.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.267
43.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.416
I've run out of stuff to sell on
eBay, man. I have nothing.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.983
Man, let's just call it what it is,
all right? We're ready to go back.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.611
So quit then. Go crawling
back to Miami. Go ahead.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.196
- Ain't gotta be like this.
- Yeah, it does.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.514
Sorry, I'm not leavin'.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.325
Really?

14:02.425 --> 14:04.268
Yeah. I'm stayin' here.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.940
All right, peace, man.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.353
Hold up.

16:27.195 --> 16:29.038
Lookin' good.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.101
Yo, man, you shoulda
called me sooner.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.310
I had no idea you needed a job.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.271
Yeah. Thank you.
Things have been a little rough.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.481
Well, this is perfect!

16:38.581 --> 16:40.274
My grandparents have been
looking for someone to help out.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.360
Come on, I'll introduce you.
Glad you came.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.862
How's Camille? You guys likin' LA?

16:44.962 --> 16:49.092
Yeah, she's great. LA's fun.
What's not to like about LA?

16:54.138 --> 16:57.375
Rumba's the dance of love,
Miss Nakamura.

16:57.475 --> 16:58.876
It's a courtship ritual.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.211
That's Chad.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.672
Copy me. Quick, slow, quick, slow.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.444
<i>Baba!</i>

17:05.148 --> 17:07.635
You must be Sean.

17:07.734 --> 17:12.285
Mooski, you didn't tell me
your friend was so cute.

17:12.615 --> 17:13.641
Thanks for letting me stay here.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.059
You're welcome.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.644
Oh. Finally, you are here.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.355
The women's toilet is leaking
like a broken faucet.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.648
And faucet is broken, too.
Please fix.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.694
Here. You are sleeping here
in the closets of storage.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.945
Please, drop bag and get to work.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.719
<i>Opa</i>, he just got in.
Let him settle in first.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.077
Come on, I'll buy you a smoothie
before you get your hands dirty.

17:33.177 --> 17:36.372
Go! Have smoothie. This can wait.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.349
Okay.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.028
Have you heard of <i>The Vortex</i> ?

17:44.146 --> 17:48.116
Uh. That's something on VH1, right?

17:49.652 --> 17:51.554
What? Camille loves VH1.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.556
Hey, nothin'.

17:53.656 --> 17:57.330
No, but you should totally
enter that. Call The Mob.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.730
No, come on, man. The Mob
is like the king of the streets.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.857
I mean, sure, you and Eddy
had a little fallout or whatever.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.209
But you can't enter alone.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.653
I mean, don't get me wrong.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.740
Back in the day, I woulda tore that
thing up. Y'know what I'm sayin'?

18:10.840 --> 18:14.744
I mean, that's not a bad idea.
You and I on a crew together.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.162
Come on.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.415
I would love to, but I have a
job now, man. I'm an engineer.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.919
Come on, man. You're the Moose.
There's only one Moose.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.253
My life's totally different now.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.255
I've got a lot of responsibility.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.840
Dance competitions are fun and all,

18:27.940 --> 18:29.300
but they're not really
gonna pay the bills.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.302
No, but that's the beauty of it, man.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.013
This competition does pay
the bills. For a while, too.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.160
I get it, man. I just...

18:40.119 --> 18:42.587
I can't, man, I'm sorry.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.674
But you should do it.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.026
Yeah.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.277
All right? See you around.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.969
Later, man.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.988
- Hello!
- Hi!

19:08.564 --> 19:10.566
Welcome back.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.199
- Good day?
- Yeah.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.282
So how's Sean doing?

19:18.824 --> 19:21.076
He's okay.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.646
He's got this really crazy idea.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.022
What?

19:25.122 --> 19:27.295
It's honestly really crazy.

19:28.626 --> 19:31.862
Remember that ad you saw
about <i>The Vortex </i> on VH1?

19:31.962 --> 19:33.573
Yeah. What about it?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.408
Yeah, well, he's thinking
about entering it.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.618
And he can kinda pull it off.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.663
But the only thing is he doesn't
have anyone to do it with.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.207
And, so, well...

19:43.307 --> 19:45.376
He kinda asked me to do it.

19:45.476 --> 19:46.544
He asked you?

19:46.644 --> 19:48.612
I know. Crazy, right?

19:49.313 --> 19:50.814
Uh...

19:51.857 --> 19:54.760
- And?
- No, no, no, I can't.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.637
It's completely impractical.

19:56.737 --> 20:00.933
So you have no interest
in dancing at all?

20:01.033 --> 20:04.645
Nope. Pretty sure that
part of my life is over.

20:04.745 --> 20:08.670
Yup. I don't really even think
about it anymore, really.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.776
Yeah. It was the right call.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.570
What would you tell Mr. McGowan?

20:12.670 --> 20:14.447
And how would you pull a
crew together that fast?

20:14.547 --> 20:15.823
Exactly.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.825
It's not like you've been keeping
up with training or anything.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.285
Hey, hey, hey. I'm in shape.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.078
But at that level?

20:21.178 --> 20:23.539
I doubt you'd be able to
pick up where you left off.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.208
Oh, come on! The Moose
does not lose these skills.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.926
Shout it!

20:29.562 --> 20:32.923
Wait a second. You just set me up.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.820
Maybe.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.494
So you really want me to do this?

20:42.032 --> 20:43.601
You wanna do this.

20:43.701 --> 20:47.396
And if you want something,
I want it for you.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.441
Really? 'Cause I thought you
would've thought it was crazy.

20:50.541 --> 20:53.840
Please! Since when did
I become that girl?

20:54.253 --> 20:57.573
So you think I could swing it?
With my job and everything?

20:57.673 --> 20:59.909
You're The Dancing Moose.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.012
The Dancing Moose figures it out.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.434
Mr. Alexander.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.602
Mr. McGowan.

21:26.702 --> 21:27.978
What are you doing?

21:28.078 --> 21:29.579
Um...

21:30.080 --> 21:34.318
Oh. It's actually a
focusing exercise, sir.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.445
It gets the blood flowing
faster to your brain,

21:36.545 --> 21:41.425
thus causing an increase
in productivity, sir.

21:41.675 --> 21:46.396
Um. You should try it sometime.
It's good for your health.

21:48.140 --> 21:52.144
Actually, I was hoping
that we could talk, sir.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.964
Look, my grandma's not
really doing too well,

21:55.064 --> 21:58.801
and I'm the only grandson
that she kinda has out here,

21:58.901 --> 22:02.138
and I promised my family
that I'd take care of her.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.975
You have a grandma that
used to bake you cookies

22:06.075 --> 22:07.643
and knit you sweaters.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.229
My grandmother was a prison warden.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.397
Oh, wow.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.690
I didn't know that.

22:12.790 --> 22:17.319
She must have been a
very strong, tough woman

22:17.419 --> 22:19.238
who probably did
have a soft side, too.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.824
She was a prison warden.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.659
I got that.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.162
So you do understand
that from time to time,

22:26.262 --> 22:30.958
if I need to leave work to, you
know, take her to the doctor.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.335
I can admire a man who
puts his family first.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.628
Thank you very much
for understanding.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.839
As long as he gets here two
hours early every morning

22:36.939 --> 22:38.883
to cover the time he's missing.

22:38.983 --> 22:39.967
Two hours?

22:40.067 --> 22:41.784
Two hours.

22:50.494 --> 22:54.294
Yes! Work those hips,
Miss Turnbuckle, work those hips.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.317
Twerk it, Miss Turnbuckle.

22:56.417 --> 22:59.236
Vegas, baby, Vegas. We got three
weeks to get ready for Vegas.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.863
You comin' down from there, or what?

23:00.963 --> 23:04.216
What? Oh, hell, yeah!
You better not be playin' me, man.

23:04.967 --> 23:05.993
What about your job?

23:06.093 --> 23:07.036
Figured it out.

23:07.136 --> 23:08.621
Come on.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.456
What about my job? Your grandparents?

23:10.556 --> 23:13.209
Oh, they'll be all right. Chad knows how
to change a light bulb. Right, Chad?

23:13.309 --> 23:15.586
- Yeah.
- I know just the place to start.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.047
Figure eights.
Work those figure eights.

23:26.155 --> 23:29.499
And we're at a fashion shoot?

23:30.159 --> 23:31.831
Okay.

23:35.289 --> 23:38.918
Oh, I get it. Costumes.
Good thinkin'.

23:40.044 --> 23:42.279
Oh, my God, that looks terrible!

23:42.379 --> 23:44.240
I told you she would screw this up.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.574
I look terrible?

23:45.674 --> 23:48.202
I'm not finished yet.
I just need some more pins.

23:48.302 --> 23:49.912
Pins won't work!
What is wrong with you?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.455
You are making her look fat.

23:51.555 --> 23:52.540
What did I tell you?

23:52.640 --> 23:53.707
You're making me look fat?

23:53.807 --> 23:54.750
You don't look fat.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.253
You need to solve this right now.
She looks like a whale.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.379
Get me out of this dress.

23:58.479 --> 23:59.755
Okay, I am gonna get some more pins.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.966
I'm calling the designer.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.092
Oh, my God, is this
making me look fat?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.595
Moose! What are you doing here?

24:06.695 --> 24:08.097
What do you mean?
You're in our new crew.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.266
We're gonna dance on live
television in Vegas... Blah blah blah!

24:10.366 --> 24:11.767
Come on, we'll fill
you in in the car.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.603
No. Are you talking about that
<i>Vortex</i> thing? I have work. Can't.

24:14.703 --> 24:17.547
Yo! Think this is a
good look for the crew.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.777
Who's the pretty boy?

24:21.877 --> 24:24.446
This is Sean. He's an
amazing choreographer.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.699
You've never heard of The Mob?

24:26.799 --> 24:27.867
No.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.660
How have you not heard of The Mob?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.557
I don't get out much.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.272
And, ah, who are you?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.292
Hey, guys, relax, okay?

24:36.392 --> 24:39.795
Andie, this is Sean.
The Mob is totally legit.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.882
And, Sean, Andie knows
what she's doing. All right?

24:42.982 --> 24:46.310
Cool. So she will help with
the costumes then, right?

24:46.410 --> 24:49.421
This costume girl could dance
circles around your ass.

24:49.621 --> 24:51.289
Okay, good to know.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.750
Anytime, anyplace.

24:55.077 --> 24:58.421
Okay, guys,
let's just chill, all right?

25:00.416 --> 25:02.918
Come on. Can we talk about this?

25:08.716 --> 25:12.202
Does it always have to end up
in a big, giant dance battle?

25:45.252 --> 25:47.279
What is going on here?

25:47.379 --> 25:48.739
Get me off this thing!

25:48.839 --> 25:51.742
All right, hang on, hang on.
Somebody get her a ladder.

25:51.842 --> 25:53.786
Hang on. We'll get you down.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.579
Oh, my God, the couture!

25:55.679 --> 25:57.476
What is this?

25:58.265 --> 26:01.143
Clean up this mess or you're fired.

26:02.436 --> 26:04.108
Fired!

26:04.938 --> 26:06.173
Eh.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.195
Clean it up yourselves.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.137
<i>Turns out, Moose was well-connected.</i>

26:12.237 --> 26:15.599
<i>First we found Vladd,
the Human Robot.</i>

26:15.699 --> 26:18.811
<i>And we all know he can
do some crazy stuff.</i>

26:18.911 --> 26:20.646
<i>Speaking of crazy,</i>

26:20.746 --> 26:23.774
<i>we hunted down these two
busted-up sign spinners</i>

26:23.874 --> 26:25.609
<i>who turned out to be...</i>

26:25.709 --> 26:26.735
Moose!

26:26.835 --> 26:27.820
What are you doing here?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.655
<i>The Santiago Twins.</i>

26:29.755 --> 26:32.724
<i>Two of the most amazing
dancers I've ever seen.</i>

26:35.427 --> 26:37.454
<i>Next, Andie took us to meet Violet.</i>

26:37.554 --> 26:40.916
This is Violet.
Trust me, we need her.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.752
<i>She makes a mean
banana split, but, hey...</i>

26:43.852 --> 26:44.795
Ooh! That was hot.

26:44.895 --> 26:48.194
<i>That's just her day job.
This girl can move.</i>

26:49.233 --> 26:50.884
<i>Then calls went out
to the East Coast.</i>

26:53.695 --> 26:54.680
Hello?

26:54.780 --> 26:55.764
<i>Jenny Kido.</i>

26:55.864 --> 26:57.599
Does your aunt still have that van?

26:57.699 --> 26:59.792
<i>Ditched her telemarketing job,</i>

27:00.119 --> 27:02.246
<i>grabbed her aunt's van,</i>

27:03.622 --> 27:05.749
<i>and hit the road.</i>

27:12.005 --> 27:15.054
<i>Before heading west,
she picked up Monster.</i>

27:15.551 --> 27:17.244
- Monster!
- Kido!

27:17.344 --> 27:19.079
Road trip! Are you in?

27:19.179 --> 27:22.332
<i>A sick B-boy from the Bronx.</i>

27:22.432 --> 27:25.731
<i>They swung through Baltimore
and grabbed our buddy, Hair,</i>

27:25.894 --> 27:29.006
<i>who refused to come
without his barber.</i>

27:29.106 --> 27:32.951
<i>But, that guy could
dance his ass off.</i>

27:35.445 --> 27:37.222
How are you?

27:37.322 --> 27:41.143
<i>Three days later, we all showed
up at the Cha Cha Palace.</i>

27:41.243 --> 27:42.811
Mr. Moose!

27:42.911 --> 27:45.022
Santiagos! Twin killers.

27:45.122 --> 27:46.623
Hey!

27:47.416 --> 27:48.609
Hi, Vladd.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.986
Hi! How are you?

27:51.086 --> 27:53.781
<i>Our crew was finally complete.</i>

27:53.881 --> 27:54.948
Hi!

27:55.048 --> 27:56.492
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

27:56.592 --> 27:58.077
Let's call it a day,
Miss Vanderblast.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.745
You go take a load off those bunions.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.830
Thank you.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.855
That's Chad, everybody.
He teaches here.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.510
What's up, what's up?

28:14.610 --> 28:17.513
Smooth. Are we still sayin' that?

28:17.613 --> 28:19.556
Yo. So we're gonna be training here.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.558
Ana and Boris already
gave us the "all clear."

28:21.658 --> 28:23.660
We'll try and stay
outta your way. Cool?

28:26.330 --> 28:27.564
Cool.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.108
Cool.

28:29.208 --> 28:33.633
Okay, junior cotillion.
Today, foxtrot promenade.

28:35.631 --> 28:36.907
Five minutes and we get started.

28:37.007 --> 28:38.492
All right, all right.

28:38.592 --> 28:40.244
Thank you all for coming out.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.496
Yeah. Everybody knows
why they're here.

28:42.596 --> 28:44.665
This isn't just another
dance competition.

28:44.765 --> 28:47.626
We win this thing and
we get our own show.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.337
For three years.

28:49.937 --> 28:54.091
That means quitting our day
jobs and dancing full-time.

28:54.191 --> 28:57.219
The first round of <i>The Vortex</i>
is a video submission.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.263
That's right. We got
some really cool ideas.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.182
I work at a lab. And my boss
is at a conference next week,

29:02.282 --> 29:05.205
and if we work fast, we can shoot
our video there while he's gone.

29:05.619 --> 29:07.396
Only the best of the best get in.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.773
So we need to give them a show.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.901
So let's get to work and put our
heads in the same place. Yeah?

29:13.001 --> 29:14.069
All right, let's do it.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.737
Yeah, if we rehearse
every single day,

29:15.837 --> 29:17.884
I don't think that'll be a problem.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.741
No, it wouldn't be.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.327
But we need to think
and breathe as a unit.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.122
Thinkin' and breathin'? No, we need
to dance. We're gonna dance.

29:25.222 --> 29:28.500
Well, obviously, we're gonna dance,
'cause that's why we're here.

29:28.600 --> 29:32.896
So just to be clear,
if we're gonna be a crew,

29:33.021 --> 29:34.506
who's gonna be in charge?

29:34.606 --> 29:36.278
- I am.
- I am.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.264
What? I'm not doin' that.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.432
What? Go over there!

29:43.532 --> 29:45.079
Where?

29:47.744 --> 29:49.021
Yeah, come on, we're doin' it.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.064
Okay, cotillion, ignore those guys.

29:51.164 --> 29:54.276
Eyes right here.
Keep your eyes on the Chad.

29:54.376 --> 29:57.279
Come on. Everybody up. Let's go.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.739
Okay, take your partners.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.591
Just follow what I'm doin'. Go.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.726
So cool.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.254
Guys! Seriously?

30:15.439 --> 30:17.441
Okay, let's move on.

30:18.859 --> 30:20.302
Hit this hard. Come back.

30:20.402 --> 30:21.720
There you go.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.270
I wanna be in your crew.

30:31.370 --> 30:32.814
Dude, no offense, man,

30:32.914 --> 30:34.316
but the cha-cha-cha doesn't really

30:34.416 --> 30:36.026
mesh with what we're doin' here.

30:36.126 --> 30:38.862
Yeah. So I cha-cha with cougars?

30:38.962 --> 30:41.281
Pays the bills. Chicks dig it.

30:41.381 --> 30:44.760
But I have been known
to get pretty crunk.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.621
This competition's gonna
be hard enough as it is.

30:47.721 --> 30:50.269
We don't need any help
from Rico Suave over here.

30:50.432 --> 30:54.607
Ooh. Ouch. Rico Suave, huh?

30:55.228 --> 30:56.945
You don't think I got it, do ya?

30:58.482 --> 30:59.967
Do you wanna see what I got?

31:00.067 --> 31:03.262
Nope. No, I don't wanna
see what you've got.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.429
Hit the music.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.448
Watch.

31:33.767 --> 31:35.210
That was great!

31:35.310 --> 31:37.107
Bravo!

31:37.270 --> 31:38.463
I can't believe it.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.189
Whatever.

31:42.442 --> 31:44.159
Fancy pants.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.502
Mooski, take another meatball.

32:58.602 --> 33:01.505
You need to be strong
tomorrow for your video.

33:01.605 --> 33:05.133
I also made veggie loaf in
case anyone wants some.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.718
Vegan, vaygan...

33:06.818 --> 33:09.412
Vegan, Baba, vegan.

33:09.571 --> 33:10.972
Foo to your vegan!

33:11.072 --> 33:14.017
You need meat. Not grass.
Good for the blood.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.394
Look at how she eats her balls.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.728
You like the balls?

33:16.828 --> 33:18.438
Yes, thank you. They're great.

33:18.538 --> 33:22.025
I give you recipe. You make for him.
See how many he eats?

33:22.125 --> 33:23.944
No, they're actually good.

33:24.044 --> 33:26.763
Texture's a little different than
regular meatballs, though.

33:27.088 --> 33:30.057
Kinda chewier.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.261
That means he was a tough goat.

33:37.682 --> 33:38.667
Goat?

33:38.767 --> 33:40.159
Goat. You know.

33:40.644 --> 33:41.795
Yeah, goat balls.

33:41.895 --> 33:44.614
Yeah, they're a total delicacy
back in the old country.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.717
Mmm.

33:47.817 --> 33:51.787
And once again, veggie loaf? Anyone?

33:53.365 --> 33:54.957
I like the meat.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.108
Are you sure you're
okay with the dishes?

34:03.208 --> 34:04.317
Yeah, we got this.

34:04.417 --> 34:05.944
Yeah, go. We're almost done.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.946
And next time, I'm cooking dinner.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.532
I do not hate that idea at all.

34:10.632 --> 34:11.699
Okay. Sounds good.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.534
- Bye.
<i>- Adios, muchachos.</i>

34:13.635 --> 34:15.306
Bye!

34:16.763 --> 34:20.167
Those goat balls? Oh, my God,
you shoulda seen the look on your face.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.960
Hey. I took it like a man.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.004
Like a man. Right.

34:24.103 --> 34:27.215
I didn't know if you
were gonna cry or puke.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.342
You don't seem like the crying type.

34:29.442 --> 34:30.802
So I seem like the puking type?

34:30.902 --> 34:32.745
Well...

34:33.862 --> 34:36.475
God, have you always
been such a perfectionist?

34:36.574 --> 34:38.748
I'm not a perfectionist.

34:41.705 --> 34:44.440
Must have driven your ex nuts, huh?

34:44.541 --> 34:46.884
She was a dancer, too, right?

34:48.085 --> 34:50.947
I'm sorry. Moose told me. I didn't
know if it was a secret or anything.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.074
No, it's not.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.016
It was a while ago.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.683
She was in my crew and...

34:58.513 --> 35:00.435
She left.

35:02.309 --> 35:04.561
I know all about that.

35:04.811 --> 35:09.157
Can be really hard.
Dancing together. Being together.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.985
Gets intense.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.573
Yeah.

35:18.158 --> 35:22.708
Look, look, look. Come here.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.227
It's amazing how long
they've been together.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.186
They still dance.

35:49.731 --> 35:53.176
Wow. Moose, this is
perfect for the video.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.744
Wait till you see what
I rigged up in here.

35:57.614 --> 36:00.475
Dude, this place is crazy.
I can't believe you work here.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.353
How long till your boss gets
back from his conference?

36:03.453 --> 36:06.189
Precisely four hours and nine minutes

36:06.289 --> 36:09.963
as long as he doesn't travel
faster than 67 miles per hour.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.405
But we gotta work fast. Ready?

36:13.505 --> 36:15.723
Who's on music? Let's roll.

36:17.425 --> 36:18.926
Hmm.

38:59.254 --> 39:01.552
Yo. It's so sick!

39:02.549 --> 39:05.326
All right, it's official.
We're LMNTRIX.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.724
LMNTRIX.

39:08.596 --> 39:14.169
LMNTRIX! LMNTRIX! LMNTRIX!

39:19.732 --> 39:21.984
Still nothin' from <i>The Vortex</i> ?

39:23.069 --> 39:27.073
Nope. Two weeks and not a thing.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.159
Dude, our video was great.

39:31.411 --> 39:32.520
I don't get it.

39:33.955 --> 39:37.174
Yeah. I thought we killed it.

39:38.334 --> 39:42.213
I wish things would just
work out just for once.

39:42.422 --> 39:44.515
How'd your grandparents do it?

39:45.049 --> 39:47.267
Must have been easier
back in the day.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.205
Was it easier back then?

39:50.305 --> 39:52.278
I had to shovel...

39:53.850 --> 39:54.834
Sheep poop.

39:54.934 --> 39:58.588
Yeah. That's how I paid for
our shoes so we could dance.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.465
Sounds terrible.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.509
Are you kidding? It was
greatest time of my life.

40:02.609 --> 40:04.844
We dance all night and
forget about everything.

40:04.944 --> 40:08.848
Oh, yeah. The light in
the bathroom, it needs fix.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.700
And one more thing...

40:10.825 --> 40:12.310
- Ana!
- What?

40:12.410 --> 40:13.728
Where is the package?
The lemon tricks.

40:13.828 --> 40:14.771
The what?

40:14.871 --> 40:16.356
The lemon tricks thing.

40:16.456 --> 40:17.957
Oh.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.754
Here.

40:26.466 --> 40:28.388
It's from <i>The Vortex.</i>

40:32.430 --> 40:37.527
<i>Welcome, Team LMNTRIX.
Your journey to</i> The Vortex <i>begins now.</i>

40:37.810 --> 40:39.212
Vegas, baby!

40:39.312 --> 40:41.189
Oh, yeah!

40:42.023 --> 40:43.633
Vegas!

41:38.246 --> 41:40.273
Caesars! You guys, it's Caesars!

41:40.373 --> 41:43.126
Stop, stop, stop!

41:45.169 --> 41:47.822
Welcome to Caesars Palace.
You guys here for <i>The Vortex</i> ?

41:47.922 --> 41:50.533
All right, step right this
way to meet Alexxa.

41:50.633 --> 41:53.494
So, Jasper, how did you feel
when you found out that

41:53.594 --> 41:56.164
The Grim Knights will
be competing here?

41:56.264 --> 41:58.291
At Caesars Palace?

41:58.391 --> 42:00.877
Oh, my God. So, so blessed.

42:00.977 --> 42:05.235
When you grow up like I did,
life puts a cage around your heart.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.051
All you hear is the can'ts,
the shouldn'ts, the don'ts.

42:08.151 --> 42:11.679
Being in this magical place and
having this beautiful opportunity?

42:11.779 --> 42:14.807
To me, that is the dream.

42:14.907 --> 42:15.892
Aw.

42:15.992 --> 42:17.393
Believe, yo.

42:17.493 --> 42:19.187
She's so beautiful.

42:19.287 --> 42:20.438
Yo.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.023
That is so inspiring.

42:22.123 --> 42:23.858
Thank you very much.

42:23.958 --> 42:25.068
We got it. Cut.

42:25.168 --> 42:27.028
Hey. Wait, wait, wait.
Can we do it again?

42:27.128 --> 42:29.072
I want us to do something
with a little bit more passion.

42:29.172 --> 42:31.908
Maybe talk about how I was
bullied as a kid. Powder!

42:32.008 --> 42:33.660
LMNTRIX? All right, you'll do.
Get up here.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.161
So cute! Come here, guys.

42:35.261 --> 42:37.434
Go, go, go!

42:42.226 --> 42:43.211
Oh, hey.

42:43.311 --> 42:46.234
It's The Lab Rats! Yeah!

42:46.397 --> 42:48.383
I see you got yourself a new crew.

42:48.483 --> 42:50.485
Y'all come to see some real dancin'?

42:51.444 --> 42:52.720
Man, let's get outta here.

42:52.820 --> 42:53.805
Ooh.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.723
So it begins.

42:55.823 --> 43:00.373
The drama! The passion! <i>The Vortex.</i>

43:00.620 --> 43:02.480
How intimidating is it

43:02.580 --> 43:06.317
to be going up against
all these tough crews?

43:06.417 --> 43:07.777
No, we're excited.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.947
We're a new crew. But don't
let that fool you. We're ready.

43:11.047 --> 43:13.157
We been training really
hard to get here.

43:13.257 --> 43:16.452
Now I hear The Grim Knights
are the crew to beat.

43:17.804 --> 43:20.056
How do you feel about that?

43:20.598 --> 43:22.125
It's news to me.

43:22.225 --> 43:24.523
We literally just arrived, so...

43:27.438 --> 43:29.757
Okay. Thank you, guys.

43:29.857 --> 43:32.451
Wait a minute, please!

43:32.860 --> 43:34.095
It is going to be fierce.

43:34.195 --> 43:36.931
I'm Alexxa Brava,
and I am signing off.

43:45.832 --> 43:47.108
Look at this place.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.925
Smells great.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.407
After that, you know what I mean?

43:54.507 --> 43:56.034
Is that Sean?

43:56.134 --> 43:57.952
Look who it is.

43:58.052 --> 43:59.996
What are you guys doin' here?

44:00.096 --> 44:02.957
What are we...
What are you doing here?

44:03.057 --> 44:04.558
Huh?

44:05.268 --> 44:06.335
Man, it was really
nice of you to call

44:06.435 --> 44:07.420
your crew before you
entered this thing.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.422
- I know everybody's really happy with you.
- Mmm-hmm.

44:09.522 --> 44:10.465
- Crew?
- Mmm.

44:10.565 --> 44:13.301
Oh, you mean my crew. The crew
that didn't leave me in LA.

44:13.401 --> 44:15.386
Look, man, let's just get one
thing straight, all right?

44:15.486 --> 44:18.222
We were done with LA, but we
were never done with The Mob.

44:18.322 --> 44:20.516
Yeah. So this is your new crew?

44:20.616 --> 44:22.789
Yeah, well, they ain't my book club.

44:22.952 --> 44:24.270
So you called them
before you called us?

44:24.370 --> 44:26.981
Yeah, man. Glad you made
some new friends, bro.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.483
They any good? They look pretty good.

44:28.583 --> 44:30.651
Yeah, they're the best of the best.

44:30.751 --> 44:34.447
The best of the best? Oh.
That's a statement right there. Yeah.

44:34.547 --> 44:36.157
- As long as you believe that.
- I believe it.

44:36.257 --> 44:38.534
Guys, we didn't get that last part.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.431
Could you guys just repeat it?

44:40.553 --> 44:41.537
What?

44:41.637 --> 44:44.165
And could you be a little bit more hurt?
A little more vulnerable.

44:44.265 --> 44:45.291
Who are you?

44:45.391 --> 44:47.126
Could you maybe step back?

44:47.226 --> 44:48.669
I'm with <i>The Vortex.</i>

44:48.769 --> 44:51.613
- Yo, who is this guy?
- New crew.

44:53.191 --> 44:55.364
- What's this about?
- Wow!

44:56.277 --> 44:58.825
That was Sean's best friend.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.495
Come on, let's go check out the room.

45:06.621 --> 45:08.714
Welcome to your suite.

45:09.582 --> 45:11.192
Care of <i>The Vortex.</i>

45:20.760 --> 45:22.933
Feel it.

45:23.221 --> 45:26.082
I love you, too,
my little munchkin puppy.

45:26.182 --> 45:29.151
Yeah, you're such a little
fluffy muffin. You're so cute.

45:29.685 --> 45:32.713
We'd have the best time ever.
I wish you were here. I swear.

45:34.065 --> 45:35.133
I love you, baby.

45:35.233 --> 45:36.884
Camille says, "Hi."

45:38.653 --> 45:40.325
Send it to her.

46:05.972 --> 46:08.249
There's a huge bed upstairs.

46:09.433 --> 46:11.411
Wanna check it out?

46:11.811 --> 46:13.858
Gross.

46:14.021 --> 46:16.007
Please go away.

46:19.652 --> 46:21.995
What is that smell?

46:22.321 --> 46:24.198
It's my scent.

46:25.992 --> 46:28.853
Real smooth, buddy. Real smooth.

46:41.757 --> 46:43.242
Hey, The Mob.

46:43.342 --> 46:45.264
Anytime, baby. Mob up.

47:12.288 --> 47:16.067
Good evening. Welcome to <i>The Vortex.</i>

47:20.629 --> 47:24.242
Tonight, you'll meet the
dancers of tomorrow.

47:24.342 --> 47:26.244
Finest in the world.

47:26.344 --> 47:29.956
Each vying to be the lords of Vegas.

47:30.056 --> 47:33.459
With a world-class show of their own

47:33.559 --> 47:36.733
at sensational Caesars Palace!

47:40.107 --> 47:42.325
Wish them luck.

47:42.818 --> 47:44.695
They're gonna need it.

49:32.887 --> 49:35.389
Was that hot enough for you?

49:37.933 --> 49:40.586
So talented.

49:40.686 --> 49:43.735
So full of hope and dreams.

49:44.023 --> 49:45.966
They wish they could all stay.

49:46.066 --> 49:49.160
But we only have room for four.

49:49.445 --> 49:54.325
The crews that will fight it
out in the battle ring are...

49:55.659 --> 49:57.686
Divine Intention.

50:06.754 --> 50:08.255
Shh.

50:08.422 --> 50:10.199
The Mob.

50:20.559 --> 50:22.732
The Grim Knights.

50:29.485 --> 50:32.454
And LMNTRIX!

50:42.456 --> 50:44.833
My God!

50:46.544 --> 50:47.903
Who ate all the muffins?

50:48.003 --> 50:49.280
Andie, you did.

50:49.380 --> 50:50.990
Is there more coffee?

50:51.090 --> 50:52.158
Coffee.

50:52.258 --> 50:55.453
All right, guys, we gotta
start rehearsal soon.

50:56.637 --> 50:58.873
I don't think I can face
those camera crews anymore.

51:00.891 --> 51:02.793
Good morning!

51:02.893 --> 51:04.690
Housekeeping?

51:06.814 --> 51:08.611
I got an idea.

51:10.150 --> 51:13.304
This way. This is
the place I told you.

51:13.404 --> 51:14.388
Sean.

51:16.532 --> 51:19.160
Good luck! Bye-bye!

51:19.827 --> 51:24.207
Man! This is what I call
a great rehearsal space.

51:26.208 --> 51:27.925
All right.

51:28.836 --> 51:32.823
All right, yo, yo, listen up.

51:32.923 --> 51:36.535
That circus up there,
the cameras, the people, the drama...

51:36.635 --> 51:37.912
That's nothin' but a distraction.

51:38.012 --> 51:39.455
Could keep us from
winnin' this thing.

51:39.555 --> 51:43.209
So let's stay focused,
and let's get to business.

51:43.309 --> 51:45.152
Yeah!

51:50.858 --> 51:52.359
Whoo!

51:53.027 --> 51:54.528
Go!

52:02.286 --> 52:04.834
And one, and two...

52:11.754 --> 52:14.256
Go like this. Follow me.

52:17.384 --> 52:20.387
Five, six, seven, eight.

52:24.350 --> 52:25.897
Okay.

52:27.311 --> 52:29.046
Okay. Ready? Let's go, come on.

52:29.146 --> 52:30.965
Five, six, seven, eight.

52:31.065 --> 52:34.552
One and two and three and four and
five and six and seven and eight.

52:34.652 --> 52:36.404
Make sure these are clean.

52:36.862 --> 52:42.243
One and two and three and four and
five and six and seven and eight.

52:42.368 --> 52:44.228
Again, right away, let's go.

52:44.328 --> 52:47.606
One and two and three and...
Stop! Stop! Stop!

52:47.706 --> 52:50.234
He needs to catch on. He's not
doin' it right. Let's do it again.

52:50.334 --> 52:52.903
Five, six, seven, eight.

52:53.003 --> 52:58.225
One and two and three and four
and five and six, seven, eight.

52:58.926 --> 52:59.910
No!

53:00.010 --> 53:01.787
Come on, that was good, man.

53:01.887 --> 53:04.665
Not good enough. You wanna win?

53:04.765 --> 53:06.208
I know you want this as bad as I do.

53:06.308 --> 53:07.543
We're tired, man.

53:07.643 --> 53:09.611
Please, help me help
you guys, all right?

53:09.728 --> 53:12.006
All right, I think we've
all had it for today.

53:12.106 --> 53:15.426
Why don't you guys just head out.
We'll meet you upstairs.

53:15.526 --> 53:17.869
- See you upstairs.
- Yeah.

53:29.248 --> 53:31.191
Look, I wanna try this thing with you

53:31.291 --> 53:32.943
that I've been imagining in my head.

53:34.128 --> 53:35.946
Better be the dancing
you're talking about.

53:36.046 --> 53:37.448
Easy.

53:40.300 --> 53:43.579
All right. You're gonna
put that leg right here,

53:43.679 --> 53:46.457
that leg in my hand,
and hold on to my neck, okay?

53:46.557 --> 53:48.042
And then what?

53:48.142 --> 53:50.360
Just trust me. Okay?

53:52.980 --> 53:54.882
You're so sweaty.

53:54.982 --> 53:57.718
Come on, be serious. Okay?

53:57.818 --> 53:59.970
So, I'm gonna jump
into your other hand?

54:00.070 --> 54:01.096
Yeah.

54:01.196 --> 54:02.222
Okay.

54:02.322 --> 54:05.559
Three, two... Go ahead.

54:05.659 --> 54:07.269
- There we go.
- Oh, my God.

54:07.369 --> 54:09.188
- Oh.
- We got it. We got it.

54:09.288 --> 54:10.397
All right. I'm gonna toss you up.

54:10.497 --> 54:11.482
Now what? No!

54:11.582 --> 54:12.775
And you're gonna go into a layout.

54:12.875 --> 54:14.652
No, put me down. Stop it.

54:14.752 --> 54:18.072
Stop it. Put me down.

54:18.172 --> 54:19.990
You gotta trust me. You gotta let go.

54:20.090 --> 54:21.867
Okay, I know that you want some big,

54:21.967 --> 54:24.161
cool move, but you can't force it.

54:24.261 --> 54:25.329
Sounds like an excuse.

54:25.429 --> 54:28.523
You saying I take the easy
way out, or something?

54:29.141 --> 54:31.564
You don't know anything about me.

54:32.102 --> 54:35.756
Do you know why I was primping
those models when we met?

54:35.856 --> 54:38.175
- You know why I was doing that?
- No.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.511
I was a part of this
amazing dance group.

54:40.611 --> 54:43.263
We pushed ourselves so hard
that I blew out my knee.

54:43.363 --> 54:45.015
Thought I'd never dance again.

54:45.115 --> 54:46.517
Yeah, really messed me up.

54:46.617 --> 54:49.436
So, now, every time I come down hard,

54:49.536 --> 54:52.459
I'm just waiting to
hear that pop again.

54:54.041 --> 54:58.466
Okay. Look, I get it.

54:59.963 --> 55:01.281
But if you push past it and
get outta your head...

55:02.716 --> 55:04.684
Oh, my gosh.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.912
I can get over an old
knee injury, okay?

55:07.012 --> 55:08.122
I'm not scared to dance again.

55:08.222 --> 55:10.749
What I don't want to risk is this.

55:10.849 --> 55:13.001
I love that I'm a part
of something again.

55:13.101 --> 55:15.820
It's the closest thing
I know to family.

55:16.730 --> 55:19.528
Sure, winning, it's cool, it's great.

55:19.650 --> 55:22.824
Hanging out with you guys,
though, being here.

55:23.403 --> 55:25.246
Doing what I love.

55:26.490 --> 55:28.742
It's all I care about.

55:32.412 --> 55:36.507
Yeah, well, it's not enough for me.

56:02.401 --> 56:05.279
Honey, I was looking for you.

56:08.907 --> 56:10.225
What's wrong?

56:10.325 --> 56:14.455
Sean. He's so frustrating.
He drives me crazy.

56:16.290 --> 56:18.192
Do you know that he was wearing
ladies' underwear on his head

56:18.292 --> 56:19.693
when I first met him?

56:19.793 --> 56:23.530
That's pretty funny. You like him.

56:23.630 --> 56:25.632
No, I don't.

56:25.883 --> 56:27.760
He drives me nuts.

56:27.968 --> 56:29.620
Yeah, that means you like him.

56:29.720 --> 56:31.663
Stop it.

56:31.763 --> 56:33.264
Oh.

56:33.807 --> 56:36.710
What I would like is
a night off. Okay?

56:36.810 --> 56:39.046
Come on, we're in Vegas,
let's do something.

56:39.146 --> 56:42.049
No, Sean will be mad if we go out.

56:42.149 --> 56:43.821
Whatever.

56:44.151 --> 56:46.119
Let's get the crew.

56:47.654 --> 56:48.847
Hmm?

56:48.947 --> 56:50.808
- Yeah? We go out?
- Yeah.

56:50.908 --> 56:53.143
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay. Let's go.

56:56.663 --> 56:59.336
We just gotta get there, okay?

57:01.668 --> 57:03.511
Vladd, what's up?

57:03.670 --> 57:06.719
I think they're in love.
Kinda like us.

57:07.382 --> 57:08.883
Oh.

57:18.018 --> 57:20.111
Poor robot bastard.

57:33.158 --> 57:35.001
Hey.

57:36.328 --> 57:38.171
We're going out.

57:38.538 --> 57:40.315
I know hanging out with
us isn't enough for you,

57:40.415 --> 57:43.964
but the rest of us wanna have
some fun while we're here.

57:52.844 --> 57:54.641
Wait up.

58:05.399 --> 58:06.900
Whoa!

58:12.197 --> 58:13.698
Ow!

58:37.973 --> 58:39.474
Ha!

59:02.456 --> 59:05.025
You wanna get out of here?
Take a walk?

59:05.125 --> 59:06.717
Yeah.

59:10.380 --> 59:13.258
Hey. You were right.
This was a great idea.

59:19.306 --> 59:21.103
Come on.

59:25.645 --> 59:27.281
Oh, yeah.

59:27.981 --> 59:29.091
Welcome to the Clark Inn.

59:29.191 --> 59:30.817
Well, thank you.

59:32.152 --> 59:34.513
What is this place?

59:34.613 --> 59:36.390
Vintage...

59:36.490 --> 59:38.558
Vintage Park? Vintage Vegas Park.

59:38.658 --> 59:40.159
Yeah.

59:41.912 --> 59:45.541
So, you nervous about going
up against The Mob tomorrow?

59:47.417 --> 59:50.295
Moose told me you
and Eddy go way back.

59:51.254 --> 59:55.759
We grew up together.
We were like brothers.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.470
What about you?

59:59.846 --> 01:00:02.249
What happened between
you and your ex?

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:05.335
Oh. Well, Moose must have
told you about Chase.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.545
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:10.490
I don't know. Long distance
thing was kinda hard.

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:12.843
We were on tour, so we were always

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:15.595
on different schedules,
different cities.

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:17.055
You know, it just
never seemed to work.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:20.204
But that was a really long time ago.

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:25.459
Dancing was the only
important thing to him.

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:29.584
He's an idiot.

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:37.317
- Oh, my God.
- You kidding me?

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:46.067
Thank you.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.464
Old school Bobby Brown.

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:52.190
Yeah.

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:55.906
All right, fancy pants.

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:18.778
How come pot stickers taste
so much better in Vegas?

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:21.239
Because they're eggrolls.

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:23.241
Right? Go with this guy.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:25.410
- Give me one.
- Try it.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.012
You like it? I liked it.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:29.847
Ew!

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:32.209
Don't want your stinky, goopy mess.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:34.628
Come on, bro. Let it go, man.

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:35.962
No. No.

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:37.631
This guy's the worst.

01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:40.967
- Ugh!
- Tries so hard, man. Just so hard.

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:43.762
- Yo. Mooski, this is your song.
- Yeah.

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:45.055
Come on, Moose, you gotta dance.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.223
- Nah.
- Come on, Moose.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:47.515
- Come on.
- Do it! Do it!

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:49.392
Give us a little sump'n.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.335
Go, go, go.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:57.859
Let's go, man.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.692
What?

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:27.947
Whoa!

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:25.842
Oh, no.

01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:45.283
Moose, I heard.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.093
You okay?

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:48.990
What happened to Camille?

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:51.097
I don't know, I can't find her.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:52.682
I've called her a million times.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:56.561
I'm sure she's somewhere, man.
People don't just disappear in Vegas.

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:58.938
Actually, it happens all the time.

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:01.232
I watched on TV. 20/20.

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:02.442
Scary.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:04.214
Kido.

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:07.781
Oh. My bad. Sorry, Mooski. Sorry.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.475
She's probably halfway to LA by now.

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:13.561
Come on, man. There's no way
she went all the way back.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.581
I had no idea that girl
was gonna kiss me.

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:20.060
Those moves? I guess you
were just too irresistible.

01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:24.214
Look, guys, I'm sorry. All right.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:25.799
I shouldn't be here.

01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:27.550
It was all innocent fun.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.302
I guess she didn't know that, but...

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:31.805
I just... I need to go home.

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:34.557
I mean, I love you guys. This has all
been great and fun and all, but...

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.329
I mean, I love Camille.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:40.313
Wait. Can't this wait?
We need you here.

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:42.148
We battle The Mob tomorrow.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.234
You can't just abandon us now.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:45.485
Yes, you can.

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:46.653
Are you kidding me?

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:48.800
No, I'm not kidding.

01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:50.281
Get outta here.

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:52.951
Go do what you gotta do.

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:55.053
Sorry to let you guys down.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.542
It's all good, bro.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:10.093
<i>And the winner is...</i>

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.845
<i>The Grim Knights.</i>

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.850
Yo. Divine Intention just got
destroyed by The Grim Knights.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.017
It was a massacre.

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:20.186
How we gonna do this without Moose?

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:23.523
Hey, guys, come on.
Just stay focused, okay?

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:25.608
We'll be just fine without Moose.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.986
<i>Stay tuned. Up after the break,</i>

01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:31.430
<i>The Mob and LMNTRIX
battle for their lives.</i>

01:07:34.759 --> 01:07:38.809
<i>Keep on watching.
And do not forget to text.</i>

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:41.499
<i>Every vote counts.</i>

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:44.318
<i>Are you ready for more?</i>

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.938
<i>I know I am.</i>

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:49.048
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah.

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:51.885
<i>Do we have any fans
of The Mob out there?</i>

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:57.490
<i>What about LMNTRIX?</i>

01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:02.920
This is crazy, man.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:06.632
I never thought that me and you
would end up against each other.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:12.071
Are you seriously ignoring me right now?
Because I swear to God, man...

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:15.140
Don't even worry about it.
It's not even worth it.

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.893
<i>Are we ready?</i>

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:26.586
<i>LMNTRIX versus The Mob.</i>

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:30.924
<i>In this corner, hailing from Miami...</i>

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:32.901
<i>The Mob!</i>

01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:38.890
<i>And in this corner, hailing
from Los Angeles, California...</i>

01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:41.537
<i>LMNTRIX!</i>

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:44.895
<i>Round 1. Dance.</i>

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:25.216
<i>Round 2.</i>

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:28.398
<i>Dance.</i>

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.303
<i>Round 3.</i>

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.701
<i>Dance.</i>

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:41.174
- Come on. Do it.
- No.

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:43.509
No. Stop it.

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:45.110
No.

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:11.996
<i>Your votes have been tallied,</i>

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:14.644
<i>and the results are in.</i>

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:18.377
<i>May I present to you the
winners of this battle</i>

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:23.357
<i>and the surprise sleeper
crew of this competition.</i>

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:33.267
<i>LMNTRIX.</i>

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:48.007
Enjoy that win, man.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:53.204
<i>In this fight to win a three-year
contract here at Caesars Palace,</i>

01:13:53.304 --> 01:13:55.898
<i>only one battle remains.</i>

01:13:57.141 --> 01:14:00.711
<i>A clash between LMNTRIX,</i>

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:02.755
<i>who barely made the
qualifying rounds,</i>

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:06.050
<i>but somehow eked their
way into the finals,</i>

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:09.971
<i>and the team to beat,
The Grim Knights.</i>

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:18.291
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:21.502
<i>There will be blood
on the dance floor.</i>

01:14:27.922 --> 01:14:29.740
Hey. Hey. Hey!

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.075
What happened out there?

01:14:31.175 --> 01:14:32.994
What happened out there?
Are you serious?

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:35.621
You tried to pull me into a dangerous
trick that I wasn't ready for.

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:36.914
We were not ready for it.

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:39.625
But we won. We made
it to the final round.

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.568
That's all that matters?

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.819
Ah. I should've known better.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:51.095
Alexxa Brava.

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:53.197
- You guys.
- Cheers.

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:56.058
<i>Next up on VH1,
celebrating</i> The Vortex

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.436
<i>with an Alexxa Brava video marathon.</i>

01:14:58.536 --> 01:15:00.354
<i>Sweat Sugar Dance Voodoo!</i>

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:03.691
<i>You want my sweat
sugar dancing voodoo</i>

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:05.443
<i>You want the magic that I do</i>

01:15:05.543 --> 01:15:08.671
<i>Sweat sugar dancing voodoo</i>

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.032
<i>You want my sweat
sugar dancing voodoo</i>

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:13.034
- That's the guy.
- That's The Grim Knights guy.

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:14.118
What guy?

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:16.621
That ass clown Jasper.

01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:18.956
I knew I'd seen that damn
face before. I knew it.

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:21.433
Oh, my God, is he wearing
a sparkle thong?

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:23.794
He looks like a dead baby.

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:26.172
Wait till Sean hears about this.

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:27.506
Oh. Where's Sean and Andie?

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:30.134
I don't know, but she was
super pissed after the battle.

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:31.677
I don't know. Her knee's
been bothering her.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:33.095
She might be icing it. I don't know.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:36.515
Wait, ice. We need ice. We gotta
keep these babies chilled.

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:37.850
Where's the bucket?

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:41.187
I think Monster use
it to soak his foot.

01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:42.313
Ew!

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:43.356
Come on, man.

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:44.607
That's nasty.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:45.983
- Blisters.
- You're nasty, bro.

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:47.360
Dancers, blisters.
I do a lotta footwork.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.444
Hey, Andie.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:51.046
- Hey. There she is.
- There she is.

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:53.366
Damn, gangster.

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:56.094
I think I go get ice, too.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:16:00.581
All right. Okay, fill it up.
I'll fill that back up.

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:01.749
What was up with Andie?

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:04.043
Something happened to her.
I don't know. She's really upset.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:05.711
You're being so paranoid.

01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:08.005
You said it was gonna be The Mob.

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:11.968
Relax. It was a last-minute
creative decision.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.886
LMNTRIX really brought it last night,

01:16:13.986 --> 01:16:15.972
so we changed up the plan a little.

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:19.141
Hmm.

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:20.935
You guys duking it out

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:23.229
is gonna make for a much
more compelling storyline.

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:25.064
Yo, just don't make a fool outta me.

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:28.192
Don't worry, baby, it's in the bag.

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:30.715
This is gonna be some killer TV.

01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:31.904
What?

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:33.030
You don't trust me?

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.824
- Shh.
- You know I do.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.409
Oh. You do?

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:37.535
Yeah.

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:41.038
Then shut that

01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:45.814
pouty little mouth of yours.

01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:58.639
Holy balls.

01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:02.226
We just saw Jasper and Alexxa
mackin' on each other in the hallway.

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:04.186
What? You sure?

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.771
Who else dress like a zebra?

01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:07.106
That's not even the worst part.

01:17:07.206 --> 01:17:10.234
We heard them talking, and this
whole <i>Vortex</i> thing is scripted.

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.777
It's been planned.

01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:14.613
She said it was gonna be killer
TV when we all went down.

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:16.449
So they had it rigged
from the beginning?

01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:18.096
We never had a chance?

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.202
The Grim Knights were
always gonna win.

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:22.413
No, but America vote for us.

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:24.749
Maybe they just thought
they were voting for us.

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:26.250
I don't believe this.

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:28.210
Connect the dots, sister.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.296
Jasper was her backup dancer.

01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:32.089
Now he's her private dancer.

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:34.216
Jasper was her backup dancer?

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:36.302
Yeah. We just saw him on TV

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:39.555
shaking his nasty ass in
Alexxa Brava's video.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:40.931
We gotta tell someone.

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:44.977
Who we gonna tell? The producers?
They're in on it, too.

01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:48.564
Of course it's rigged.
It's reality TV. Nothing's real.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:50.775
I can't go back to
the sucky phone job.

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:53.110
What about us? We spin
those stupid sign for living.

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.820
Man, this sucks.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.138
For a second,
I thought we had a shot.

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:01.452
Hard to go back to our
old lives now, huh?

01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:03.954
Okay, hang on. We're still
going out there, okay?

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:05.206
We've worked so hard.

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:06.290
This is gonna be an opportunity

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:08.042
for us to just go out there and...

01:18:08.142 --> 01:18:09.627
What's the point? Huh?

01:18:09.727 --> 01:18:11.420
We're not gonna win this thing.
And I'm not going out there

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.214
and humiliating myself in
front of the whole world.

01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:17.468
The point is that we're an awesome
crew and amazing dancers.

01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:19.512
So, we're gonna go out there and
still show them what we've got.

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:23.557
This isn't about winning some
contest or some silly little prize.

01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:25.309
This was about booking a job.

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:27.103
Everyone in this room is sick of

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:28.979
scraping around to pay their rent.

01:18:29.079 --> 01:18:32.316
I live in a freakin'
little storage closet.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:35.903
This was about all our hard
work finally paying off,

01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:39.131
so we can have some actual stability.

01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:45.972
It was far more than that for me.

01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:55.089
Camille?

01:19:58.002 --> 01:19:59.879
You home?

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:26.705
I knew I'd find you up here.

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:32.436
Look, I know that
you're probably, like,

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:35.585
super uber galactically
pissed at me right now,

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:38.883
but I'm really sorry. And I don't
know how I let that happen.

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:45.658
Seeing you and that girl,

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:48.010
I wasn't just jealous of her,

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:51.680
but also of you.

01:20:52.139 --> 01:20:57.169
You were just having the best time,

01:20:57.269 --> 01:21:00.272
and I didn't belong.

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:03.384
I couldn't get out of
there fast enough.

01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:05.719
It felt gross.

01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:08.180
I just wanted to come home.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:12.455
But home doesn't feel
like home without you.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:16.580
Does this feel like home to you?

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:20.342
Are you kidding me?

01:21:20.918 --> 01:21:22.111
I love my life with you,

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:24.822
and I wouldn't trade it for
anything else in the world.

01:21:24.922 --> 01:21:28.826
But being in the spotlight,
that's a big part of who you are,

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:31.662
and I feel like I'm holding you back.

01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:34.765
I found the person I wanna
dance with, all right?

01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:38.669
Yeah, we have jobs and, yeah,
we have a nice apartment,

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:41.630
but, I mean, we're more than that.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:44.091
Can't we have it both ways?

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:45.592
Yeah.

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:47.928
That's what you want?

01:21:48.028 --> 01:21:49.745
Yeah.

01:21:50.114 --> 01:21:52.287
Are you sure?

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:04.631
I'm sure.

01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:12.661
Sean!

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.355
Sean. Come. Eat and
drink with us. Yes?

01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:18.542
This is so good. I'm going to eat
the whole thing, I don't care.

01:22:18.642 --> 01:22:20.002
- No worries.
- So good.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:22.129
She love it here, Sean.

01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:24.527
- We're moving here.
- Mmm.

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:27.367
Oh. You have to try this. So good.

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:30.596
So, you guys didn't
take off with Moose.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:33.932
Mooski, he knows what's important.
He doesn't need us.

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:36.101
And we would never miss finale.

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:37.686
What time tomorrow you dance, huh?

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.412
We're not.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.799
Whole contest is rigged.

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:45.506
This whole thing was
just a waste of time.

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:49.760
The Mob hates me. Andie hates me.

01:22:50.007 --> 01:22:52.635
Viva Las Vegas, everybody.

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:57.597
So you give up?

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:00.892
Yeah.

01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:04.046
Better to quit now. That's okay.
We go back, you clean toilets.

01:23:04.146 --> 01:23:05.881
I think the one in the
back is clogged, no?

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:09.735
Take it easy on him.
Can't you see his heart is broken?

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:13.806
You remember how we feel,
European Championship?

01:23:14.506 --> 01:23:16.204
That one.

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:17.851
Sean...

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:21.330
European Championship Dance Final.

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.817
I step on her foot.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:26.669
I break her foot.

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:28.837
Boom. We lose.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:32.616
I feel terrible, but she forgive me.

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:34.559
I'm not perfect.

01:23:35.219 --> 01:23:37.141
Who is perfect?

01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:41.232
Where is perfect?

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.984
Sheep poop, remember?

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:50.988
Sean,

01:23:51.485 --> 01:23:56.786
sometime you just have to
shovel through it. That's all.

01:23:57.616 --> 01:23:59.584
Yes, you have problems.

01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:02.462
You think winning is
all there is to life?

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:06.400
Is this the only reason
you work so hard

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:11.130
and give up so much to be here?

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:45.922
You know what you need to do.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:49.129
You do it.

01:25:04.308 --> 01:25:05.934
Wait, wait, wait.

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:15.489
I'm sorry.

01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:19.660
I thought I could fix everything.

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:26.355
I thought I could figure
everything out, but...

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:29.925
Okay, stop, stop, stop, dude.

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.861
You look absolutely
ridiculous when you cry.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:35.697
Sorry. I just really
need a friend right now.

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:38.450
Look, man, you're my best friend.

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:40.619
You're family.
Families fight. It's cool.

01:25:40.719 --> 01:25:43.893
You've been there for me
when I was at my worst and,

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:48.564
from the looks of it, you could
probably use someone in your corner.

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:51.880
But first you gotta come and
apologize to the rest of the family

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.799
'cause they still hate your guts.

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:55.509
Come on. Get in here.

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:57.094
Don't you dare tell 'em I cried.

01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:58.512
You look crazy when you cry.

01:25:58.612 --> 01:26:00.864
I know. I didn't cry, all right?

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:09.706
Hey.

01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:12.317
Hold up.

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:15.716
Yo, please. I've got a plan, okay?

01:26:16.713 --> 01:26:18.782
We can't go down like this, guys.

01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:20.383
Look...

01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:21.952
Where's Andie?

01:26:22.052 --> 01:26:23.678
She took off already.

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:24.955
You said we were all going home,

01:26:25.055 --> 01:26:28.766
and she didn't wanna ride
in the van with everybody.

01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:30.560
Yeah.

01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:34.673
Listen, drop your bags, please,

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:37.776
and meet me in the basement
in 10 minutes, okay?

01:26:46.284 --> 01:26:49.021
<i>Hey. It's Andie. Leave a
message after the beep.</i>

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:52.316
Hey. It's me.

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:56.903
Me and the crew have a plan
and we really need you.

01:26:57.003 --> 01:27:00.198
So, if you get this message in time,

01:27:00.298 --> 01:27:01.890
we'll be in the basement.

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:13.566
Thanks for coming, guys.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:18.508
This all started out so simple.

01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:20.610
I love dancing.

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:24.514
But everyone here knows
that it's not that easy

01:27:24.614 --> 01:27:27.851
when you're trying to
make a living out of it.

01:27:27.951 --> 01:27:29.936
Every day is a battle,

01:27:30.036 --> 01:27:33.690
and we work so hard just to be
unappreciated by some pop artist

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:37.569
or win some little competition
that everyone's gonna forget about

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:39.762
in a couple months.

01:27:40.547 --> 01:27:43.700
The thing is,

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.578
I wanted to win so bad that

01:27:46.678 --> 01:27:51.103
I didn't realize what I was losing.

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:55.478
Our lifestyle isn't that easy.

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:58.027
But it's the one we chose.

01:27:58.607 --> 01:28:01.701
So I say we choose to
make the best of it.

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:04.241
Tonight.

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:09.414
Not for the show, for the
people watching, but for us.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:14.005
This is what matters.
And I see that now.

01:28:14.372 --> 01:28:15.919
Nice.

01:28:19.336 --> 01:28:21.258
I thought you were gone.

01:28:21.797 --> 01:28:23.674
Well, I'm back.

01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:25.867
LMNTRIX is dancing, so am I.

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.536
I'm not letting my crew down.

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:28.662
Thanks for coming in.

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:30.809
I'm not doing this for you.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:33.875
So, you guys wanna do this?

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:35.127
Somebody got the music?

01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:36.253
Yeah.

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:38.255
What, you thought
I'd let you guys down?

01:28:38.355 --> 01:28:40.966
Moose!

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:42.134
And we're back!

01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:43.969
We started this thing, right?
Let's finish it.

01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:47.013
Yo. Hold up. You're not
going anywhere without us.

01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:48.739
Yo.

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:51.059
Thanks for coming, man.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.352
Really?

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:56.297
Everybody, this is my family.

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:59.668
New family, meet the old family.

01:29:00.961 --> 01:29:02.963
Y'all get along, okay?

01:29:03.129 --> 01:29:04.239
Yo.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:05.991
Okay. Let's try.

01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:08.059
- What's up, man?
- Nice to meet you.

01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:12.063
All right, so, guys, what's the plan?

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:15.459
They rigged this thing?

01:29:15.559 --> 01:29:18.107
We'll give 'em a taste
of their own medicine.

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:20.839
We bring the fuckin' house down.

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:35.291
Good evening, children of <i>The Vortex</i>.

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:43.653
We are at Caesars Palace tonight,

01:29:43.753 --> 01:29:46.865
and we are ready to settle the score.

01:29:46.965 --> 01:29:51.828
One team will leave here the
champions of <i>The Vortex</i>,

01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:54.289
with a three-year Vegas contract.

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:57.187
And one team will just

01:29:58.059 --> 01:29:59.776
leave.

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:06.777
Remember to text your votes.
And be merciless.

01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:11.932
And now, the moment we've
all been waiting for.

01:30:12.032 --> 01:30:16.394
The Grim Knights versus LMNTRIX.

01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:39.892
Whoo!

01:30:47.692 --> 01:30:49.535
Come on.

01:33:01.326 --> 01:33:03.169
Come on. Come on.

01:33:05.663 --> 01:33:07.210
Let's go.

01:33:07.499 --> 01:33:11.094
You want some of me?
You want some? Let's go!

01:34:17.402 --> 01:34:21.873
Y'all know what it is!
Let's go! Grim Knights!

01:34:24.033 --> 01:34:26.478
Weren't The Grim Knights amazing?

01:34:28.538 --> 01:34:30.506
So hot.

01:34:31.875 --> 01:34:34.486
They're gonna be very hard to beat.

01:34:34.586 --> 01:34:37.030
Next up, LMNTRIX.

01:34:43.636 --> 01:34:46.122
Thank you. Thank you.

01:34:46.222 --> 01:34:50.443
I just wanna say how much we've
enjoyed being a part of this contest.

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:55.648
And, uh, it's been
a life-changing ride.

01:34:56.065 --> 01:35:00.303
And to be going up against
The Grim Knights. What an honor.

01:35:00.403 --> 01:35:03.156
And what a compelling storyline.

01:35:04.073 --> 01:35:06.667
It's gonna make for some killer TV.

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:12.857
You know, I came here to win,
but I'm okay if that doesn't happen.

01:35:12.957 --> 01:35:15.193
Tomorrow, we might be
back to our day jobs.

01:35:15.293 --> 01:35:19.364
But tonight, we're living
the dream together!

01:35:19.464 --> 01:35:24.160
Because I'm up here on this
stage with the best dancers...

01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:26.012
No.

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.806
The best of friends.

01:35:31.601 --> 01:35:34.587
And a phenomenal woman

01:35:34.687 --> 01:35:38.862
who's taught me what really matters.

01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:46.224
So what do you say we all just
forget about this winning or losing,

01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:47.725
and just enjoy the show?

01:38:02.627 --> 01:38:04.720
Yeah!

01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:09.409
Is that fire?

01:38:09.509 --> 01:38:11.602
No, no, no.

01:39:16.075 --> 01:39:17.226
What the hell's goin' on?

01:39:17.326 --> 01:39:19.896
Yo, I don't know.
This is some horseshit.

01:39:19.996 --> 01:39:21.731
The Mob can't dance.
This is cheating.

01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:23.457
I know.

01:40:09.086 --> 01:40:10.587
Ah-ha!

01:40:29.106 --> 01:40:30.842
Yo, this is crazy.

01:40:30.942 --> 01:40:32.659
I know!

01:42:48.954 --> 01:42:50.455
Hey.

01:42:51.499 --> 01:42:53.192
Let's do it.

01:42:53.292 --> 01:42:54.610
Let's do the move.

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:56.257
Yeah?

01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:57.780
You better catch me.

01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:59.472
Trust me.

01:43:11.936 --> 01:43:13.437
Oh!

01:44:03.404 --> 01:44:05.030
What?

01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:08.142
But I haven't even
tallied the votes yet.

01:44:08.242 --> 01:44:11.791
Did you see the stuff
on the chandeliers?

01:44:14.457 --> 01:44:16.174
I understand.

01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:18.569
Yes.

01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:21.697
This crew will make a
fabulous show at the hotel.

01:44:21.797 --> 01:44:23.298
Mmm-hmm.

01:44:24.175 --> 01:44:25.242
They got the show?

01:44:25.342 --> 01:44:26.577
Yes, they got the show.

01:44:26.677 --> 01:44:29.497
Go pack my bags.
I need a week in Cancun.

01:44:29.597 --> 01:44:32.441
What just happened? LMNTRIX just won?

01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:23.342
<i>Like I said, the life of
a dancer is not easy.</i>

01:45:23.442 --> 01:45:25.803
<i>But sometimes everything lines up.</i>

01:45:25.903 --> 01:45:27.555
<i>The world is in sync,</i>

01:45:27.655 --> 01:45:32.535
<i>and for one perfect moment
you feel totally alive.</i>

01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:17.917
B mark!

01:46:26.130 --> 01:46:27.531
One, and two, and...

01:46:27.631 --> 01:46:30.141
One, and two, and three,
and four, and five.

01:46:30.968 --> 01:46:33.266
- You have a tag here.
- Oops.

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:42.900
There it is!

01:46:43.606 --> 01:46:45.107
A mark!

01:46:45.482 --> 01:46:46.983
Pot sticker?

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:30.493
Just shut that pouty little mouth.

01:47:31.779 --> 01:47:33.180
Yeah.

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.306
Pot sticker?

01:47:34.406 --> 01:47:35.907
Spring roll!

01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:38.769
Egg roll! One more time. Here we go.

01:47:38.869 --> 01:47:41.042
Egg roll, right?

01:47:41.538 --> 01:47:43.732
I'm going to shove my
mane in your mouth.

01:47:43.832 --> 01:47:47.381
Bite it! Bite it! Bite it!

01:47:49.838 --> 01:47:52.807
One more time. Ready, and...

01:47:54.218 --> 01:47:56.720
Put me down. Put me down.
Put me down.

01:47:57.388 --> 01:47:58.581
You gotta trust me.

01:47:58.681 --> 01:48:00.457
I'm sorry, that was a bit
weird at the end for me.

01:48:02.977 --> 01:48:04.461
You gotta...

01:48:42.349 --> 01:48:43.334
Bye, guys.

01:49:02.619 --> 01:49:05.713
How long do you want me to hold this?
