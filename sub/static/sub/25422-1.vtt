01:49.087 --> 01:50.612
Russel?

02:22.890 --> 02:25.433
Russel, there's someone in here!

02:26.093 --> 02:27.378
Russel!

02:27.678 --> 02:30.130
Hey. Baby, what's wrong?

02:30.210 --> 02:32.933
- What's wrong? What is it?
- There was someone here.

02:33.013 --> 02:35.951
I got you. I got you.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.886
You're safe.

02:38.666 --> 02:40.795
There's no one in here, Lauren.

02:40.875 --> 02:42.687
I got you.

05:21.678 --> 05:23.195
Hey.

05:25.782 --> 05:27.647
We gotta get out of here.

05:31.688 --> 05:33.709
I just want you to feel safe.

05:39.913 --> 05:41.491
Okay?

05:42.655 --> 05:44.293
I love you.

05:44.373 --> 05:46.174
I love you too.

05:57.527 --> 05:59.609
Wow, look at this place.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.748
Lauren.

06:32.828 --> 06:34.213
Russel.

06:34.293 --> 06:38.208
I'm Lance, sales agent.
Welcome to twenty-first century living.

06:38.288 --> 06:40.079
I'll like you to meet
out head concierge, Dominique.

06:40.159 --> 06:43.451
- Hi.
- And our service engineer, Ryan.

06:43.531 --> 06:45.085
A pleasure.

06:45.165 --> 06:47.771
I hope you'll be joining us.

06:47.851 --> 06:50.511
Right, if you'd like to follow me this way.

06:53.583 --> 06:56.776
We have seven different scents
pumped into the lobby and elevator.

06:56.856 --> 07:00.172
We've recruited an acclaimed interior
designer, lighting specialist...

07:00.252 --> 07:03.364
...acoustical scientist,
even a feng shui expert...

07:03.444 --> 07:06.320
...to help us create the ultimate
comfort and tranquility.

07:06.400 --> 07:10.220
Now, our amenities include
a state-of-the-art fitness center...

07:10.300 --> 07:14.261
...outdoor pool, games room,
20 seat multimedia screening room.

07:15.617 --> 07:20.041
All suites have access to our 24-hour
surveillance of all key venues.

07:23.934 --> 07:26.817
Okay. Please follow me.

07:31.477 --> 07:36.039
Wireless lighting, QED window
shades with sun control fabric...

07:36.119 --> 07:40.553
...and a fully integrated
telecommunications cabling package.

07:43.741 --> 07:47.194
Why don't you take your time?
Feel free to have a look around.

07:48.825 --> 07:50.720
Go upstairs.

08:04.014 --> 08:06.079
What do you think?

08:06.759 --> 08:08.656
I think, uh...

08:10.036 --> 08:12.493
...no one deserves to live this well.

08:16.107 --> 08:19.805
70-hour work weeks,
three years without a vacation.

08:20.900 --> 08:24.717
We had two priorities...
security and serenity.

08:24.797 --> 08:28.607
And unless you wanna move into Fort Knox,
we're not gonna get more secure than this.

08:29.487 --> 08:32.327
And as for serenity...

08:40.777 --> 08:43.791
I think living outside of the city
would be great for us.

08:45.271 --> 08:47.132
You know?

08:53.554 --> 08:55.384
Whatever you decide.

10:26.182 --> 10:28.007
Let's do this.

10:31.274 --> 10:32.756
Baby.

10:34.555 --> 10:38.430
This is gonna be so good for both of us.

10:40.587 --> 10:44.532
It's, uh... it's, uh, big, gorgeous...

10:44.612 --> 10:46.813
...modern, safe.

10:47.977 --> 10:50.461
An embarrassment of riches, really.

10:50.541 --> 10:52.418
And yet?

10:56.242 --> 10:59.714
I don't know, I'm just...
I... I'm still so scared.

11:00.394 --> 11:04.658
Scared to, uh, you know,
to, uh, join the world again.

11:05.338 --> 11:07.553
Scared to pick up a paint brush.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.169
That blank canvas.

11:12.949 --> 11:14.751
But, um...

11:15.331 --> 11:18.763
...I think I'm mostly scared because
I know that if I don't stop being scared...

11:18.843 --> 11:21.330
...I'm just gonna lose everything.

11:23.186 --> 11:24.707
Right?

11:33.584 --> 11:35.483
Still working out the kinks.

11:37.283 --> 11:39.176
You look beautiful.

11:39.956 --> 11:43.304
If you get uncomfortable,
if this is a crushing bore...

11:43.384 --> 11:44.894
...we're an elevator ride away from home.

11:44.974 --> 11:48.070
- I know.
- Okay. I'll get my jacket.

11:48.150 --> 11:49.730
Okay.

12:05.268 --> 12:07.088
Hey, sweetheart.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.976
- I'm Margo.
- Hi, Margo. Russel.

12:11.056 --> 12:12.909
- Scott's wife.
- Nice to meet you.

12:12.989 --> 12:15.024
- Nice to meet you, too.
- I'm Lauren.

12:15.104 --> 12:17.156
Hi, Lauren.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.507
Come on, let's ditch the excess baggage.

12:25.653 --> 12:27.806
Phillip Starks, 120.

12:27.886 --> 12:32.694
Inherited his father's Fortune 500
marketing and advertising agency.

12:32.774 --> 12:34.365
Brilliant.

12:34.445 --> 12:38.248
And about as close to the ideal neighbor
as you can possibly ever find.

12:40.752 --> 12:45.374
Gwendolyn Serota-Talal.
Married to a Saudi kazillionaire...

12:45.454 --> 12:48.237
...who's never around,
leaving her with far too much time...

12:48.317 --> 12:50.755
...on her criminally unflawed hands.

12:51.879 --> 12:53.527
Tim Hoyle.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.126
Something to do with geoscience.

12:56.206 --> 12:59.833
Single, bit peculiar, but perfectly harmless.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.117
Oh.

13:02.197 --> 13:04.084
Don't you stray far.

13:52.305 --> 13:55.198
Well, I believe we have two things in common.

13:56.478 --> 13:58.669
- May I?
- Oh, please.

13:58.749 --> 14:01.932
So word around the building is...

14:02.012 --> 14:04.421
- ...you're a painter.
- I am.

14:04.501 --> 14:08.137
While I've never advanced beyond
the stick figure stage myself...

14:08.217 --> 14:10.280
...I do have an enthusiasm...

14:10.360 --> 14:13.709
...for impressionism, post-impressionism...

14:13.789 --> 14:15.929
...and expressionism.

14:16.009 --> 14:17.872
And the second thing?

14:17.952 --> 14:22.146
Well, we both harbor a keen
aversion to cocktail parties.

14:22.226 --> 14:23.857
- Oh.
- Not to fret...

14:23.937 --> 14:28.448
...the signs are undetectable
to your regulation "cocktalian."

14:28.528 --> 14:32.966
But as a charter member of the
save-me-from-idle-chatter alliance...

14:33.846 --> 14:35.939
...I've developed a nose.

14:36.419 --> 14:39.856
Well, to kindred neighbors.

14:41.636 --> 14:43.514
To kindred neighbors.

14:43.994 --> 14:46.469
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

15:01.065 --> 15:02.782
Someone's in here.

15:17.497 --> 15:19.783
I had a bad dream.

15:24.897 --> 15:27.672
Ali? What are you doing down here?

15:27.752 --> 15:31.629
- I had a bad dream.
- Oh, let's get you back upstairs.

15:31.709 --> 15:34.513
You can tell me and your mommy all about it.

15:43.216 --> 15:47.453
So you and Margo seemed
to get along like a house on fire.

15:47.533 --> 15:50.770
She's, um, refreshing.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.985
What, like a line of coke on a Tuesday?

15:55.715 --> 15:57.950
Did you know they have a daughter?

16:02.156 --> 16:03.653
Ali.

16:04.273 --> 16:06.728
Scott couldn't stop gushing about her.

16:12.192 --> 16:14.493
I'm just gonna go get some water.
Do you want some?

16:14.573 --> 16:16.167
Sure.

20:43.873 --> 20:45.924
So I got approval on the delisting...

20:46.004 --> 20:50.226
...so we should be able to file
notification for removal Thursday.

20:50.306 --> 20:53.463
I seem to remember you saying something
about scaling back on work...

20:53.543 --> 20:55.805
...once everything was settled.

20:56.685 --> 20:58.612
Gotcha. Phone down.

20:58.692 --> 21:02.111
<i>Initial reports claim Israeli jet fighters
bombed the guerilla base...</i>

21:02.191 --> 21:05.465
<i>...killing at least 49 soldiers
and 13 civilians.</i>

21:07.261 --> 21:09.685
A word just flashed across the screen.

21:11.865 --> 21:14.820
- What word?
- I don't know, it was too fast.

21:14.900 --> 21:18.998
But I swear, a word just flashed
across the television screen.

21:19.678 --> 21:23.290
I'm... I'm not disputing you.
It's just it's satellite TV.

21:26.455 --> 21:29.929
If it happens again I'll call Ryan.
He'll fix it. Okay?

21:44.734 --> 21:46.303
Mommy.

22:12.644 --> 22:14.183
Mommy!

23:26.361 --> 23:28.398
- Lauren? Hey!
- Jesus!

23:28.478 --> 23:29.938
- What?
- It's one of the residents.

23:30.018 --> 23:31.599
- What?
- Look. Look.

23:36.736 --> 23:40.604
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure. He was right here.

23:42.051 --> 23:45.184
Hey, hey. Remember what Beatrice said, okay?

23:45.264 --> 23:48.595
- Any change can be a trigger...
- This is not in my head, he was right here.

23:48.675 --> 23:51.103
Baby, it's just gonna take time.

23:56.976 --> 23:59.780
If it happens again, call me right away.

24:00.460 --> 24:03.103
We'll, uh, see if we can't pinpoint it.

24:03.189 --> 24:04.837
I appreciate it.

24:04.917 --> 24:07.736
Otherwise, you're settling in okay?

24:07.816 --> 24:10.247
Yeah. Yeah, we, uh...

24:10.843 --> 24:12.283
...we are.

24:13.691 --> 24:14.851
Good.

24:19.549 --> 24:21.050
Thanks.

24:25.397 --> 24:26.450
Hello.

24:26.530 --> 24:28.944
<i>Hey, just wondering if you had lunch plans.</i>

24:29.024 --> 24:30.511
I don't.

24:31.274 --> 24:35.651
Meditative was too slow.
Bikram's too hot. Kundalini too esoteric.

24:35.731 --> 24:39.111
Then I found this off-the-wall
Ashtanga studio down on Brookline.

24:39.191 --> 24:42.073
I've been attending faithfully every since.

24:42.476 --> 24:45.474
Well, looks like it agrees with you.

24:45.554 --> 24:48.514
Aw, this is truly the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

24:51.947 --> 24:53.689
Let me ask you.

24:53.769 --> 24:58.263
Have you noticed anything, uh,
unusual about your apartment?

24:59.998 --> 25:03.878
I just... I keep hearing
this strange hissing sound, like...

25:04.535 --> 25:06.339
...like something's been left on.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.780
Hm. Well...

25:09.860 --> 25:13.399
...we've had problems with the floor
heating in our en suite, and...

25:13.479 --> 25:16.330
...our terrace lights seem
to have a mind of their own...

25:16.410 --> 25:18.516
...but no hissing.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.216
I guess even Shangri-La
has its share of gremlins.

27:08.170 --> 27:10.409
Wasn't there music on in the party?

27:10.889 --> 27:12.168
Yeah.

27:12.248 --> 27:15.488
So, it's probably just on rotation
in the building's PA system.

27:15.568 --> 27:19.537
No, I checked. "Beautiful Dreamer"
is not on their playlist.

27:19.617 --> 27:23.034
And either way that wouldn't
explain the electronic hiss...

27:23.114 --> 27:25.315
...the voices, the images.

27:25.752 --> 27:27.677
So, what are you trying to say?

27:29.717 --> 27:32.533
I know how this is gonna sound, but...

27:33.513 --> 27:37.900
...what if someone is using
this building as, um...

27:38.200 --> 27:41.491
...kind of an experiment?

27:43.614 --> 27:47.042
The Pinnacle is owned by a man
named Henning Dallquist.

27:47.122 --> 27:49.638
He has extensive holdings in...

27:54.072 --> 27:56.302
I wish you wouldn't look at me like that.

28:14.123 --> 28:17.381
With respect to subliminal imagery,
Vicary was interesting.

28:17.461 --> 28:19.373
He had been using a high-speed projector...

28:19.453 --> 28:22.062
...to flash the slogans
"drink Coke" and "eat popcorn..."

28:22.142 --> 28:25.284
...at one three-thousandths of a second,
at five second intervals.

28:25.364 --> 28:28.819
Now, according to Mr. Vicary,
popcorn sales went up about 60%...

28:28.899 --> 28:32.370
- ...and Coke sales about 20%.
- So it's been proven effective?

28:32.450 --> 28:35.599
Well, that particular study
was never subjected to a, um...

28:35.679 --> 28:37.680
...proper scientific review...

28:37.960 --> 28:41.435
...and from what I gather the evidence
of success has been greatly exaggerated.

28:41.515 --> 28:43.317
Makes for good copy more than anything.

28:43.397 --> 28:48.003
Did your father ever use subliminal
advertising in any of his early campaigns?

28:48.083 --> 28:51.202
From what I understand, a few of his
competitors did test the waters...

28:51.282 --> 28:53.834
...but the FCC quickly stepped in.

28:53.914 --> 28:57.607
Ruling due process contrary to public
interest, effectively outlawing it.

28:57.687 --> 29:00.577
- And that law's enforced?
- As far as I understand.

29:00.657 --> 29:04.944
Although, as urban myth would have it,
you still have your odd department store...

29:05.024 --> 29:08.033
...slipping anti-theft warning
through their muzak systems, or...

29:08.113 --> 29:10.995
...or a heavy metal band
masking satanic messages.

29:11.075 --> 29:15.856
And of course, nowadays with your buzz
agents, product feeders, viral marketers...

29:15.936 --> 29:17.787
...everyone plugged in 24/7...

29:17.867 --> 29:21.210
...the Federal Communications
Commission need hardly have bothered.

29:21.290 --> 29:23.804
Now, may I ask,
what is your interest in all this?

29:23.884 --> 29:25.459
Oh.

29:26.243 --> 29:28.283
...I'm not really that interested. I just...

29:28.363 --> 29:31.648
...I met someone recently
who was talking about it, and...

29:31.728 --> 29:34.634
...I know your father was in advertising, so.

29:34.714 --> 29:36.211
Hm.

30:02.431 --> 30:04.092
Hey.

30:04.172 --> 30:05.816
What're you doing out here?

30:09.890 --> 30:11.896
I was just thinking about our third date.

30:13.376 --> 30:15.311
We were watching Cirque du Soleil.

30:16.623 --> 30:20.935
That trapeze artist was doing
some death defying stunt.

30:25.397 --> 30:28.598
You reached out for my hand
and you squeezed it.

30:30.433 --> 30:33.629
I just remember wishing
I could always be there...

30:34.289 --> 30:36.417
...holding your hand through the scary parts.

30:49.734 --> 30:51.922
If we don't get results
within four to six weeks...

30:52.002 --> 30:54.485
...I like to try upping the dosage.

30:54.565 --> 30:58.053
- In the interim...
- Plenty of rest, exercise...

30:58.133 --> 31:01.178
...no additional stress.

31:01.780 --> 31:03.662
I know.

31:06.525 --> 31:09.353
I checked out an adoption
agency the other day.

31:09.933 --> 31:12.334
Talk about jumping the gun, huh?

31:12.414 --> 31:16.053
Lauren, this is a minor setback.

31:18.855 --> 31:20.376
Okay.

35:00.455 --> 35:01.948
Sorry.

35:03.690 --> 35:06.834
I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you.

35:07.244 --> 35:09.748
The hallways are designed to reduce sound.

35:10.668 --> 35:12.060
Right.

35:13.313 --> 35:14.878
Tim Hoyle.

35:15.308 --> 35:17.142
I'm Lauren Curran.

35:20.923 --> 35:22.869
I'm not one of them.

35:23.865 --> 35:25.734
Excuse me?

36:20.226 --> 36:23.319
As I see you've fallen sway
to Phillip's irresistible charms.

36:25.440 --> 36:29.098
- Have you seen him the past couple days?
- I actually haven't.

36:36.451 --> 36:38.421
You can ask Lauren yourself, you know.

36:41.643 --> 36:45.088
Ali was wondering if you'd like
to come swimming with us.

36:46.761 --> 36:49.267
- Remember to kick your feet.
- I will.

36:51.796 --> 36:53.617
Good girl.

37:05.012 --> 37:06.609
Ali?

37:12.674 --> 37:14.686
Lauren, help her!

37:16.694 --> 37:19.517
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

37:31.183 --> 37:33.052
It's okay.

37:48.723 --> 37:50.815
Have you heard of, uh...

37:51.445 --> 37:56.291
...pulsed electromagnetic fields,
or, uh, covert hypnosis?

38:00.212 --> 38:01.794
Okay.

38:03.128 --> 38:05.423
Let me ask you this. Why... why you?

38:05.503 --> 38:09.668
Why can't I hear any of these sounds?
Why can't I see any of these images?

38:09.748 --> 38:12.305
I think it has something to do
with my medication.

38:12.385 --> 38:15.831
I think it acts as some sort of buffer.

38:15.911 --> 38:18.877
Or it could be the manic depression itself.

38:18.957 --> 38:21.250
I'm wired differently than you.

38:22.030 --> 38:24.102
Are you feeling all right?

38:24.510 --> 38:26.307
Yeah, I'm feeling fine.

38:27.587 --> 38:29.952
Maybe we should go see
Beatrice in the morning.

38:30.882 --> 38:34.066
I don't need to see Beatrice.
I need you to listen to me.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.814
I am listening to you, Lauren, I am.

38:37.316 --> 38:41.273
Conspiracy theories,
delusions of persecution...

38:41.353 --> 38:44.007
...messages being sent through the TV.

38:47.786 --> 38:50.656
Lauren, can't you see?
It's happening all over again.

40:14.507 --> 40:16.549
You're still grieving...

40:17.064 --> 40:19.130
...and you're still healing.

40:19.874 --> 40:22.726
It all takes time.

40:23.473 --> 40:25.747
Often a lot more time than we'd like.

40:57.171 --> 40:59.437
- Hello.
- <i>Why me?</i>

41:01.498 --> 41:05.265
Your posts are smart,
well referenced, and, uh...

41:06.145 --> 41:07.989
...I don't have anyone else.

41:10.954 --> 41:12.832
- Hello?
- <i>I'm sending you encrypted documents...</i>

41:12.912 --> 41:16.362
<i>...read them. Password
is your favorite coffee shop.</i>

42:11.554 --> 42:13.118
Phone.

42:14.979 --> 42:17.054
- Is it off?
- Yeah.

42:17.134 --> 42:18.981
Close the door.

42:22.997 --> 42:26.503
- I'll give you two minutes.
- Okay, uh...

42:27.383 --> 42:29.649
...the information you sent me, I get it.

42:29.729 --> 42:31.758
The CIA caught up...

42:31.838 --> 42:35.420
...in a mind control arms race
with the Russians and the Chinese.

42:35.500 --> 42:38.141
But, uh, what does that...

42:38.621 --> 42:40.986
...well, isn't that ancient history?

42:41.066 --> 42:43.881
Well, it's by definition
an idea ahead of its time.

42:43.961 --> 42:48.790
The digital technologies advance, so theory
and practice finally and tragically meet.

42:49.470 --> 42:51.535
What are you experiencing?

42:53.518 --> 42:56.971
Coercive flash images, I think, and, uh...

42:57.851 --> 42:59.992
...some kind of binaural sounds.

43:03.402 --> 43:06.455
- I'll send you more documents.
- Okay.

43:09.813 --> 43:11.349
You're not paranoid.

44:21.606 --> 44:23.884
Oh, God!

44:26.207 --> 44:28.463
- Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

44:34.276 --> 44:37.937
So apparently he had
a history of mental illness.

44:40.904 --> 44:43.134
We have to get out of here, Russel.

44:47.097 --> 44:48.923
He wasn't well.

44:50.740 --> 44:53.027
There's nothing more to it than that.

46:01.537 --> 46:03.593
I'd say earlier is better.

46:07.878 --> 46:10.482
Not very many people around that time of day.

46:16.652 --> 46:18.904
I just wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.

46:24.094 --> 46:26.102
Who are you talking to?

46:29.143 --> 46:31.413
I thought I heard you talking to someone.

46:31.493 --> 46:34.301
No, I wasn't talking to anyone, Lauren.

46:43.866 --> 46:46.085
I just couldn't sleep and, uh...

46:48.465 --> 46:50.361
...it beats warm milk.

47:10.980 --> 47:12.832
You sure you don't want me to stay home?

47:12.912 --> 47:15.576
No. I'll be fine.

47:19.441 --> 47:21.882
Just call me if you need to talk, okay?

47:22.948 --> 47:24.774
I love you.

48:41.239 --> 48:44.054
- Did you get the files I sent?
- Uh...

48:45.834 --> 48:47.482
...yeah.

48:50.753 --> 48:52.846
837 Audio Jammer.

48:54.394 --> 48:56.278
Who are you?

48:56.886 --> 48:59.648
Nobody. Hacker, journalist.

48:59.728 --> 49:02.986
I spend my time writing a book
about all this dark tech shit.

49:03.066 --> 49:05.484
I'd stop taking the Quintinal if I were you.

49:05.764 --> 49:09.997
I noticed you order your pharm online.
I generally advise against that.

49:11.840 --> 49:15.303
- What else do you know about me?
- My theory is...

49:15.383 --> 49:17.922
...your condition has you
operating on a frequency...

49:18.002 --> 49:20.147
...outside the range of their tech.

49:20.227 --> 49:22.793
You're like an outlier, a black swan.

49:23.173 --> 49:25.435
The catch-22...

49:25.834 --> 49:29.388
...too little meds your condition
takes over, too much...

49:29.468 --> 49:31.288
...they do.

49:32.568 --> 49:35.819
- I haven't been taking them.
- That's one for the win column.

49:36.699 --> 49:38.563
Disconnect your wifi.

49:44.263 --> 49:46.264
You watch procedurals?

49:46.644 --> 49:51.512
Common motif, everything is conjecture
or hearsay or straight-up paranoia...

49:51.592 --> 49:53.976
...until you get physical evidence.

49:55.797 --> 49:58.415
- This is The Pinnacle?
- Uh-huh.

49:58.495 --> 50:00.875
One of those files has all the lock codes.

50:03.822 --> 50:06.223
The new tech has revolutionized the world.

50:06.303 --> 50:08.231
Everything's moving at quantum speeds.

50:08.311 --> 50:11.950
Politics, commerce,
and coordinated criminal activity.

50:12.930 --> 50:16.576
You can walk into any coffee shop
in the civilized world and you can see...

50:16.656 --> 50:20.234
...our virtual consumption has us
ripe for a psychotronic takeover.

50:20.314 --> 50:22.735
So it's not that much of a stretch...

50:22.815 --> 50:26.804
...to think of competing multinationals
putting up smart buildings in Tokyo...

50:26.884 --> 50:31.022
...London, Chicago.
There's a whole world of wealthy...

50:31.102 --> 50:34.928
...cybernated marionettes just waiting
for their strings to get pulled.

50:36.751 --> 50:38.647
It's happening...

50:38.727 --> 50:41.292
...and I think you can help me prove it.

51:29.229 --> 51:30.499
Delivery.

51:31.936 --> 51:33.599
- Hi.
- How did you get through the gate?

51:33.679 --> 51:37.343
Just walked through, it was open.
720, Nancy Hiemer?

51:37.838 --> 51:40.042
I'm afraid we don't have
a resident by that name.

51:44.762 --> 51:48.156
- I'm sorry, you don't have a unit 720?
- There is a 720.

51:48.236 --> 51:50.777
- Does Nancy Hiemer live there?
- I'm not at liberty to...

51:50.857 --> 51:53.471
The point being, we don't have
a Nancy Hiemer living here.

51:53.551 --> 51:55.398
- You don't?
- I'm gonna ask you to leave.

51:55.478 --> 51:57.368
- This is The Pinnacle?
- Or I will call security.

51:57.448 --> 51:59.612
Relax, I'm just trying to deliver a package.

51:59.699 --> 52:02.743
You should get that gate checked.
I walked right in.

53:34.250 --> 53:35.627
Well...

53:36.107 --> 53:38.455
...it does look like military grade hardware.

53:38.535 --> 53:40.745
I forgot the brand name, but...

53:41.129 --> 53:43.026
...I'll look into it.

53:45.113 --> 53:49.316
I'll have a guy I know check into
this Henning Dallquist character...

53:49.396 --> 53:51.230
...see what I can dig up.

53:54.557 --> 53:56.111
You all right?

53:56.841 --> 53:58.354
Yeah.

54:06.890 --> 54:08.441
Russel?

55:07.108 --> 55:08.851
Hey.

55:08.931 --> 55:10.723
When did you get in?

55:14.115 --> 55:15.858
So who's in 410?

55:27.594 --> 55:29.471
Excuse me.

55:30.017 --> 55:31.699
That suite's vacant.

55:33.329 --> 55:34.723
Like I said.

55:34.803 --> 55:37.646
Our amenities include
a state-of-the-art fitness center...

55:37.726 --> 55:42.194
...outdoor pool, games room,
20 seat multimedia screening room.

56:00.172 --> 56:02.699
<i>It's a new generation
of single mode fibre optic.</i>

56:02.779 --> 56:04.320
What's it used for?

56:04.400 --> 56:07.262
<i>It's not our smoking gun,
if that's what you're asking.</i>

56:07.342 --> 56:09.611
What about Henning Dallquist?

56:10.419 --> 56:12.658
I gotta go, I'll call you back.

57:36.710 --> 57:39.570
- <i>I wanna meet somewhere else.</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

57:40.206 --> 57:42.051
<i>I'm being followed.</i>

58:28.718 --> 58:31.409
Henning Dallquist isn't calling the shots.

58:32.400 --> 58:34.201
Then who is?

58:36.281 --> 58:38.094
I don't know.

58:38.174 --> 58:41.099
- What is this?
- You should get out, Lauren.

58:41.179 --> 58:44.489
- What?
- Get out. Run.

58:44.569 --> 58:46.757
- Go.
- I can't.

58:46.837 --> 58:50.418
I understand how you feel.
I've been down this road myself, you know.

58:51.698 --> 58:53.679
I don't know you.

58:53.759 --> 58:57.065
I don't even know your name.
I'm supposed to listen to you?

58:57.145 --> 59:00.417
- You could be one of them.
- You found me.

59:00.897 --> 59:02.768
I didn't find you.

59:03.748 --> 59:05.636
At the end of the day...

59:06.716 --> 59:08.924
...there's a part of you
that can't be touched.

59:10.046 --> 59:13.337
You gotta listen to that part of yourself.
Who do you trust?

59:13.417 --> 59:15.489
- Wait.
- Get out.

59:15.569 --> 59:17.094
Wait!

59:37.726 --> 59:41.180
Lauren. I need to ask you to sit down.

59:42.160 --> 59:43.957
What's going on?

59:44.037 --> 59:47.227
Well, Russel thinks
you should be hospitalized again.

59:48.085 --> 59:49.615
What?

59:49.695 --> 59:52.056
This is about your son, Lauren.

59:52.915 --> 59:56.252
This is memories and emotions that have
been festering in some dark corner...

59:56.332 --> 59:59.366
...of your subconscious for so long...

59:59.446 --> 01:00:03.050
...that they've mutated
into something else altogether.

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:05.324
- Lauren.
- Stay away from me.

01:00:05.404 --> 01:00:08.811
I miss him too, Lauren.
You just gotta let him go.

01:00:11.847 --> 01:00:14.024
I don't know what to do anymore.

01:00:26.116 --> 01:00:27.651
Lauren.

01:00:28.713 --> 01:00:30.258
Lauren!

01:02:12.576 --> 01:02:14.593
That's the catch-22.

01:02:17.555 --> 01:02:20.187
Too little meds
and your condition takes over.

01:02:20.267 --> 01:02:22.088
Too much...

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.737
In the morning.

01:02:30.817 --> 01:02:33.862
I'll pack tonight and you can
take me back in the morning.

01:03:36.443 --> 01:03:38.486
Sure I can't get you anything?

01:03:39.627 --> 01:03:41.441
I'm fine.

01:03:41.657 --> 01:03:43.809
All right, I'll just be at the gym.

01:05:46.503 --> 01:05:48.996
June 2nd, 9 a.m.

01:05:53.063 --> 01:05:54.618
Initiate.

01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:17.514
Hello?

01:06:27.614 --> 01:06:29.836
Hey, can anyone hear me in here?

01:07:23.774 --> 01:07:26.599
- Come here!
- No! No!

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:00.584
Kill her. Kill her.

01:08:11.578 --> 01:08:13.281
Kill the child.

01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:29.786
Kill.

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:37.305
Murder the child. Kill the child.

01:08:45.094 --> 01:08:46.621
Breathe.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:50.011
I'll get you outta here.
You're gonna be all right.

01:08:50.999 --> 01:08:51.881
Come on.

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:56.258
They're trying to get me to kill Ali
at the playground. She's a 3-year-old.

01:08:56.337 --> 01:08:59.290
Then they'll prove that they
can get anyone to do anything.

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:04.131
My car's on the south side of the street.
The safety's off.

01:09:04.211 --> 01:09:05.379
I'm not leaving you.

01:09:05.459 --> 01:09:08.167
That's a 3-year-old girl
you're talking about, right?

01:09:08.861 --> 01:09:11.828
- Lauren!
- My name's Vernon, by the way.

01:09:11.908 --> 01:09:13.113
Go.

01:09:17.104 --> 01:09:19.130
Lauren!

01:09:37.243 --> 01:09:39.725
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:09:39.805 --> 01:09:41.658
He's in the stairwell.

01:09:41.938 --> 01:09:45.346
I told you my name already.
I don't... Listen.

01:09:45.426 --> 01:09:48.312
Listen... you're not listening to me! What...

01:09:50.077 --> 01:09:51.323
Damn it.

01:10:16.686 --> 01:10:18.900
You're Ephrina, right?

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.536
Ali's in danger.

01:10:26.548 --> 01:10:28.350
Stay back.

01:10:31.758 --> 01:10:34.414
Stop! This woman, she's crazy!

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:38.127
- Stop! Stop!
- Lauren, I'm here to help you.

01:10:38.207 --> 01:10:40.167
Stay away from me.

01:10:42.477 --> 01:10:44.922
Stay away. Get in the car, sweetie.

01:10:45.759 --> 01:10:48.546
Get down, get down so no one can see you.

01:10:48.626 --> 01:10:50.627
Lauren, I'm trying to help you.

01:10:50.708 --> 01:10:52.520
- Stay back.
- You were right.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.577
Everything you were trying to say this
whole time, every word of it is true.

01:10:57.923 --> 01:11:00.836
- No, I will shoot you, Russel.
- It's a spy cam.

01:11:00.916 --> 01:11:03.452
I was trying to prove to you that
it was all in your head so I hid it...

01:11:03.547 --> 01:11:05.507
...in the office, Lauren.

01:11:05.587 --> 01:11:07.770
I saw what they did to you.

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:10.057
I saw you strapped to that chair...

01:11:10.137 --> 01:11:13.749
...and all the images and the sounds
they were trying to pummel you with.

01:11:15.698 --> 01:11:18.055
Lauren. Lauren.

01:11:18.135 --> 01:11:20.430
They almost got to me, okay?

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:22.379
Now I'm here for you.

01:11:24.065 --> 01:11:25.678
Lauren!

01:11:27.261 --> 01:11:29.108
Stay away.

01:11:47.477 --> 01:11:50.179
Kill the child. Ali.

01:11:51.759 --> 01:11:53.228
Ali.

01:11:53.408 --> 01:11:55.409
- Ali.
- Kill the child.

01:12:15.272 --> 01:12:17.065
Kill her!

01:12:18.586 --> 01:12:20.468
Kill her!

01:13:20.317 --> 01:13:21.723
We're safe now.

01:13:44.241 --> 01:13:46.272
Wait right here for me.

01:14:01.807 --> 01:14:03.701
Are you frightened, honey?

01:14:07.961 --> 01:14:11.787
I know this must seem really scary...

01:14:11.867 --> 01:14:13.768
...and hard to understand.

01:14:14.546 --> 01:14:16.359
But I promise...

01:14:17.139 --> 01:14:19.153
...it's almost over now.

01:14:19.533 --> 01:14:21.857
Okay? Okay.

01:14:22.915 --> 01:14:25.171
Can you lay down here for me?

01:14:36.022 --> 01:14:38.429
Mommy. Mommy.

01:14:41.803 --> 01:14:44.214
Mommy, please kill her.

01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:19.672
Hello, Lauren.

01:17:20.622 --> 01:17:22.183
Phillip.

01:17:23.125 --> 01:17:25.199
Care to put down your bag?

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.731
- Any complications?
- None.

01:17:37.823 --> 01:17:40.493
Lauren, you are fully aware
of what you've done?

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.430
I am.

01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:44.893
How you feel about that?

01:17:44.973 --> 01:17:46.786
I feel contented.

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:50.701
Hm, why is that?

01:17:51.843 --> 01:17:54.519
I've done exactly what was asked of me.

01:17:55.499 --> 01:17:58.174
You do understand that,
when everything is brought to light...

01:17:58.254 --> 01:18:00.474
...you'll be charged
with first degree murder.

01:18:00.554 --> 01:18:02.448
Does this concern you?

01:18:03.694 --> 01:18:06.324
I've done exactly what was asked of me.

01:18:16.302 --> 01:18:18.809
You cannot begin to fathom the...

01:18:18.889 --> 01:18:22.180
...extraordinary contribution
you have made here today.

01:18:23.463 --> 01:18:25.362
Psychotechnology...

01:18:26.542 --> 01:18:28.495
...the battle for the mind.

01:18:28.575 --> 01:18:30.658
It's the new arms race.

01:18:30.738 --> 01:18:33.823
The holy grail of global sovereignty.

01:18:34.363 --> 01:18:36.208
And with your help...

01:18:36.988 --> 01:18:40.990
...we've just managed to leave our
competitors in the proverbial dust.

01:18:42.572 --> 01:18:44.537
As with any war...

01:18:45.127 --> 01:18:49.147
...victory can only be achieved
with certain sacrifices.

01:18:49.817 --> 01:18:52.332
And history will bear out
that none of this...

01:18:52.412 --> 01:18:54.504
...none of this has been done in vain.

01:19:19.599 --> 01:19:21.599
I had a bad dream.

01:19:21.679 --> 01:19:23.823
Everyone plugged in 24/7.

01:19:26.086 --> 01:19:27.803
Long psychotic episode.

01:19:28.773 --> 01:19:30.396
Who do you trust?

01:19:30.476 --> 01:19:33.926
- Lauren, I'm trying to help you.
- Who do you trust?

01:19:38.454 --> 01:19:39.613
Russel?

01:19:41.183 --> 01:19:43.459
Just let them know she's safe.

01:19:53.486 --> 01:19:56.609
Evidence of success
has been greatly exaggerated.

01:19:58.351 --> 01:20:00.214
What the fuck is this?

01:20:12.509 --> 01:20:14.352
It's okay.

01:21:44.828 --> 01:21:47.316
I can't get this damn thing to work.

01:21:51.145 --> 01:21:52.966
That might be a good thing.

01:22:01.018 --> 01:22:02.866
We're all safe now.
