13:25.861 --> 13:28.343
We have a demon that
apparates or disapparates.

13:28.346 --> 13:30.625
We're gonna need all
wands on deck, right?

13:30.627 --> 13:32.435
- You got my reference!
- Yeah.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.702
Boss of the year.

13:33.705 --> 13:38.483
Yeah, I'm feeling fine. Just
worry about the demon and his boss.

13:38.486 --> 13:40.001
Okay?

13:40.003 --> 13:41.203
Okay.

14:00.338 --> 14:02.205
- Why do you keep doing that?
- What?

14:02.208 --> 14:03.875
Looking behind you.

14:03.878 --> 14:07.028
You were doing that in prison, like
you're afraid somebody's following you.

14:07.030 --> 14:08.696
- Pfft!
- What?

14:08.698 --> 14:11.232
Like it's odd to be on edge in prison?

14:11.234 --> 14:13.166
Or in the middle of some creepy woods

14:13.169 --> 14:15.204
when a monster's
dragged your sister away?

14:16.439 --> 14:19.440
- It was my birthday.
- Sorry. What was?

14:19.442 --> 14:21.197
The last time you took me camping,

14:21.200 --> 14:24.044
it was the weekend of my birthday and...

14:24.047 --> 14:26.114
I wanted to go see The Pixies.

14:26.116 --> 14:29.549
- Huh! Hanson. You wanted to see Hanson.
- Yeah, right.

14:29.552 --> 14:32.386
And you thought taking me into the woods

14:32.389 --> 14:36.124
with a packet of dehydrated
chili was a much better idea.

14:36.127 --> 14:38.059
Yes, and then I forgot the bowls,

14:38.061 --> 14:41.262
so we had to eat the
damn thing with our hands.

14:41.264 --> 14:43.064
I was so pissed.

14:43.066 --> 14:45.633
I should've put down the
damn Gameboy, if I'd known...

14:45.635 --> 14:48.803
Yeah. If you'd known I'd be
gone a couple of days later.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.271
I might've actually listened.

14:50.273 --> 14:52.274
Yeah. Hey, you did listen.

14:53.056 --> 14:56.593
You... You taught yourself everything.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.747
You listened to the lessons and
you got yourself off of that cliff.

14:59.749 --> 15:03.151
You did, alone. [SIGHING]

15:03.153 --> 15:04.887
Why me, though? Why...?

15:05.922 --> 15:09.157
You never brought Willa or Waverly.
It was always just you and me.

15:09.159 --> 15:12.018
Well... Willa was Ward's
right from the get-go.

15:12.021 --> 15:13.388
And Waverly...

15:14.097 --> 15:16.097
...she was everyone else's. But you...

15:16.099 --> 15:18.433
ooh, you...

15:18.435 --> 15:22.140
you came into this world wailing
and kicking, just like I was.

15:22.143 --> 15:25.306
So I wanted to make sure you
could survive by yourself,

15:25.308 --> 15:27.308
but you know what? Being an heir,

15:27.310 --> 15:29.511
it has made you soft.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.949
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means...

15:34.775 --> 15:39.421
...you're leaning on your
team of outlaws and misfits.

15:39.424 --> 15:41.189
They're my people and I trust them.

15:41.191 --> 15:44.126
Yeah, well, where the hell
are they? It's been hours.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.663
I don't know.

15:48.665 --> 15:52.935
Yeah. The moment that
you rely on someone...

15:54.204 --> 15:58.799
to protect you, be there
for you, you're dead.

16:00.643 --> 16:04.345
I know it's all on me... Mama.

16:04.347 --> 16:07.782
You remember how it was all on
me when you had your episodes?

16:07.784 --> 16:10.452
People thought I was the crazy one.

16:11.479 --> 16:14.381
A bad seed from the time
I was eight years old!

16:18.228 --> 16:20.162
Waverly needed her mother.

16:23.166 --> 16:24.932
I needed my mother.

16:24.934 --> 16:26.368
And Alice doesn't?

16:31.574 --> 16:33.475
Don't you dare.

16:35.178 --> 16:37.178
We are the same, Wynonna.

16:37.180 --> 16:39.914
And that is what scares you,

16:39.916 --> 16:41.741
how similar we are.

16:41.744 --> 16:44.185
You left. You abandoned us.

16:44.187 --> 16:45.788
You abandoned me.

You were late to the party last night.

- You want to talk about it?

17:11.903 --> 17:14.047
- Nope.
- Okay...

17:14.050 --> 17:16.018
So it's not baby Alice?

17:18.821 --> 17:21.055
No. She is safe.

17:21.057 --> 17:23.425
Now that's all I can ask for.

17:26.429 --> 17:28.229
No, I am angry,

17:28.231 --> 17:30.431
because the fight has been fixed.

17:30.433 --> 17:31.502
What fight?

17:31.505 --> 17:34.634
<i>The</i> fight between
the living and the dying.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.071
When the Iron Witch made her wish

17:37.073 --> 17:39.308
and made Wynonna, poof, disappear...

17:40.743 --> 17:44.579
...you and me, we were enemies.

17:44.581 --> 17:47.648

18:04.100 --> 18:06.272
You know... Listen, you got time.

18:06.275 --> 18:09.538
Time for what?! Huh? To replace
my bad deeds with good ones?

18:09.541 --> 18:11.339
No, that is the rub, Dolls.

18:11.341 --> 18:14.743
That is what they do not tell
you about turning the hero.

18:15.778 --> 18:18.080
It turns you into a killer too.

28:35.860 --> 28:39.062
Okay. I can't fight him in here.

28:43.301 --> 28:45.468
But... but I can get a jump on him.

28:45.470 --> 28:47.670
I can get a jump on him out there.

28:47.672 --> 28:49.472
- [WAVERLY WHIMPERING]
- It's okay.

28:49.474 --> 28:52.108
I swear on my favourite boy band

28:52.110 --> 28:55.544
I'm gonna kill him and then
I'm gonna mmm-bop right back.

28:55.546 --> 28:56.779
Okay?

28:56.781 --> 28:58.981
- [WHIMPERING]
- Yeah, the booby-traps.

28:58.983 --> 29:01.685
I know. I was just testing you.

29:10.110 --> 29:12.378
What's going on? Haught's
not back with the Earps?

29:13.498 --> 29:14.864
Jeremy?

29:14.866 --> 29:17.233
- I was gonna call you.
- [PHONE CHIMING]

29:17.235 --> 29:18.402
Mm?

29:20.505 --> 29:22.306
How long have they been MIA?

29:23.173 --> 29:24.439
Okay. Alright.

29:24.442 --> 29:26.175
Hey, no, no.

29:26.177 --> 29:27.988
You are already so far outta line...

29:27.991 --> 29:30.803
Look, I knew you'd say hell with my
warnings and go blazing in after them.

29:30.805 --> 29:32.672
You do not get to make those decisions

29:32.675 --> 29:35.243
and you do not get to hesitate
because of what might happen.

29:36.853 --> 29:40.722
Okay. Fine. Don't think about yourself.

29:40.725 --> 29:43.927
But we haven't warned the
others. Maybe think of about them?

29:49.511 --> 29:51.167
Sneaky dickstick!

29:51.169 --> 29:52.369
Hello!

29:53.171 --> 29:55.739
Hey! I'm Wynonna Earp.

29:56.941 --> 29:58.542
Trespasser.

30:02.547 --> 30:06.549
Real cozy... cabin of horrors
you got there, revenant.

30:06.551 --> 30:08.680
Property Brothers know about you?

30:08.683 --> 30:11.654
Nobody knows about me.

30:11.656 --> 30:13.363
This land is my land.

30:13.366 --> 30:14.645
Please don't start singing.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.579
- [GUN COCKING]
- [GRUNTING]

30:17.762 --> 30:19.172
I'll eat you first.

30:19.175 --> 30:21.764
What's with demons and
eating people? Huh?

30:21.766 --> 30:25.302
Mama Olive, the Widows, Bulshar...

30:26.904 --> 30:28.905
- Bulshar.
- Big fan, are we?

30:32.175 --> 30:33.842
No. H-h-he's buried,

30:33.845 --> 30:36.412
gone, gone,

30:36.414 --> 30:38.215
never to find me again!

30:38.983 --> 30:42.986
I hate to break it to
ya... but he is risen.

30:46.190 --> 30:48.190
- [CRACKING]
- Ah!! Ah!

30:48.192 --> 30:50.360
- Ah.
- [WYNONNA GROANING]

30:51.095 --> 30:54.330
Ah! Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!

30:54.332 --> 30:56.261
Please get me out!

30:57.503 --> 31:00.369
Tricks, they're not just for kids. Ah!

31:00.371 --> 31:01.571
Oh!

31:03.674 --> 31:07.444
[WYNONNA]: <i>Please get me
out! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!</i>

31:13.032 --> 31:16.133
Wynonna? Ha! Oh. Hey,
I got my voice back.

31:16.136 --> 31:17.597
Wynonna?!

31:17.600 --> 31:19.255
What happened?!

31:19.257 --> 31:20.824
Oh, he's basically dead.

31:21.826 --> 31:23.960
- [WHIPPING SOUND]
- Oh. Ah!!

31:25.963 --> 31:28.098
Nicole. Nice boots.

31:29.033 --> 31:31.289
Oh, Doc, those are great
jeans. Are those new?

31:31.292 --> 31:35.037
- Where's Waverly?
- Waverly's good. She's good.

31:35.039 --> 31:37.706
I killed the bad guy,
as you do, and, uh...

31:37.708 --> 31:39.975
now I'm just, you know,

31:39.977 --> 31:43.563
doing some thinking
and having some me time.

31:43.566 --> 31:46.250
- Yeah, you about done?
- Yeah, please. God.

31:49.387 --> 31:51.487
Oh!! That... [GRUNTING]

31:51.489 --> 31:53.757
[GROANING, PANTING]

32:00.613 --> 32:02.024
Are you...?

32:02.027 --> 32:05.822
Oh, listen, I don't want to ask if
you're alright, but... are you alright?

32:05.824 --> 32:08.258
Nothing a hot bath in a
bottle of whiskey won't cure.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.260
Oh, don't you mean "and"
a bottle of whiskey?

32:10.262 --> 32:12.697
[CHUCKLING] Ask me in five minutes.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.733
Okay.

32:18.837 --> 32:20.471
I'll get you fixed.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.263
I get my voice back, then
suddenly you lost yours?

32:46.865 --> 32:48.065
Ahem.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.269
I really meant what I said.

32:52.476 --> 32:54.477
About being sorry. Um...

32:55.874 --> 32:57.855
How long have you known where she is?

33:00.879 --> 33:02.979
Uh... a while.

33:02.982 --> 33:04.616
How long, Wynonna?

33:08.887 --> 33:10.588
The whole time.

33:11.757 --> 33:15.092
They moved her to the new
facility before I went to Greece.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.130
But I only went to see her
again after Bulshar rose.

33:20.086 --> 33:21.953
She knows things about him.

33:23.940 --> 33:26.342
You kept me from my mother for years?

33:28.440 --> 33:30.908
She asked me not to
tell you where she was.

33:33.144 --> 33:34.312
Ever.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.320
- [WAVERLY]: Dolls?
- [DOLLS]: Yeah.

33:43.322 --> 33:46.857
Uh, can you... can you
take me to your truck?

33:47.459 --> 33:49.327
I can't be here right now.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.797
Alright, come on.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.066
It's alright.

34:01.473 --> 34:04.141
How could she keep that
kind of secret from me?

34:04.943 --> 34:08.245
It's hard to tell people the truth
if you know it'll devastate them.

34:08.947 --> 34:10.147
It's hard.

34:15.152 --> 34:19.155
- Anything I should know?
- Well, we screwed up.

34:19.157 --> 34:22.759
Ah, well, sounds like standard
Earp operating procedure.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.628
We can get through that.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.956
I should be doing this,
going to get Peacemaker.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.264
Yeah, or me.

34:28.266 --> 34:29.887
Oh, did one of you guys have

34:29.889 --> 34:32.699
a harness in your car for
impromptu weekend excursions?

34:33.972 --> 34:35.005
No.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.641
I have nine years of
climbing experience.

34:37.643 --> 34:40.911
You are the heir, and you
can't even look over the edge.

34:42.848 --> 34:45.614
Well, uh, heights, they
give me the weezzies.

34:45.617 --> 34:49.587
I will be down and back before you
can say, "redheads do it better."

34:55.292 --> 34:58.105
- [SOBBING] Argh!
- [GROANING]

34:58.108 --> 35:00.605
- Dolls, what's wrong?
- I'm good. I'm just running on fumes.

35:00.608 --> 35:02.551
- I'm good, I'm good, yeah.
- No.

35:02.554 --> 35:04.789
- Dolls, what's wrong?
- [DOLLS GROANING]

35:08.640 --> 35:09.707
Dolls.

35:13.011 --> 35:14.145
Dolls?

35:15.647 --> 35:17.548
- Dolls?
- Waverly...

35:20.988 --> 35:23.020
Wynonna's gonna need you...

35:25.223 --> 35:26.824
...more than ever.

35:27.893 --> 35:31.262
Okay, now you're really freaking
me out. Dolls, what's happening?

35:33.231 --> 35:34.765
[GRUNTING]

35:36.435 --> 35:38.467
Ah. Ah. Hey, guys?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.305
Something's happening with the rope.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.348
- [SCREAMING]
- Haught!

35:43.408 --> 35:44.809
Haught!

- [PANTING]
- Ah!

35:56.855 --> 35:58.589
[ROARING]

36:00.358 --> 36:02.066
You're a dead man!

36:04.429 --> 36:06.129
[GROANING] Dolls!

36:07.065 --> 36:08.199
[GUN COCKING]

36:18.944 --> 36:20.093
Come on.

36:20.094 --> 36:21.602
- Okay, Earp, you're good.
- What?!

36:21.605 --> 36:23.371
- Watch your legs.
- No, don't!

36:25.884 --> 36:27.485
[GRUNTING]

36:28.720 --> 36:30.386
[GRUNTING]

36:30.388 --> 36:32.623
Doc! Jesus, we're having a day.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.238
You cannot kill me with mortal weapons.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.832
You're gonna feel real
stupid in a second!

36:52.644 --> 36:55.146
[GRUNTING]

36:57.249 --> 37:00.718
[JEREMY]: <i>Hello? Check, check.
Doc? Can anyone hear me?</i>

37:02.320 --> 37:04.221
Jeremy? [PANTING]

37:05.590 --> 37:06.910
Okay.

37:06.913 --> 37:09.738
Everything was fine, but
then... there were screams.

37:10.829 --> 37:14.764
Dolls has gone to help, but my...
my stupid stupidest leg is...

37:14.766 --> 37:16.766
<i>Waverly, okay, listen to me.</i>

37:16.769 --> 37:20.446
Whatever Black Badge did to
Dolls... it's made him unstable.

37:20.449 --> 37:22.038
What?

37:22.040 --> 37:24.871
Here we go. [GROANING AND GRUNTING]

37:25.944 --> 37:27.844
Unstable? Un...

37:27.846 --> 37:29.280
Unstable how?

37:33.285 --> 37:35.152
- Oh, I'm running out of rope!
- [GRUNTING]

37:36.133 --> 37:37.734
Shit! Dolls!

37:39.207 --> 37:41.891
- Wynonna, you've gotta let go!
- Not happening!

37:43.098 --> 37:45.863
If you don't, we're both
going over this cliff!

37:47.566 --> 37:49.400
- Be smart, Wynonna.
- [EXCLAIMING]

37:51.236 --> 37:53.937
[GROWLING] The earth thirsts for blood.

37:53.939 --> 37:57.313
- Dolls!
- Someone must die here today.

37:57.316 --> 37:58.942
- [EXCLAIMING]
- I'm slipping!

37:58.944 --> 38:00.777
- Do it!!
- No.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.779
- Will it be one...
- [SCREAMING]

38:02.781 --> 38:04.614
- ...or two...
- [EXCLAIMING]

38:04.616 --> 38:06.098

- [EXCLAIMING]

38:15.393 --> 38:16.994
It's okay.

Here. Here. [PANTING]

38:40.418 --> 38:41.485
[GASPING]

38:41.486 --> 38:44.426
You brought your lapdog
to a dragon fight, asshole.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.225
[DOC]: Wynonna!!

38:55.767 --> 38:57.134
What? I don't...

38:57.905 --> 39:00.439
He was on his feet.
Hey, Bu-Bulshar was here.

39:00.442 --> 39:02.509
I was gonna shoot the
bastard. What happened?

39:02.512 --> 39:04.040
He just fell over.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.766
He collapsed. And he's not breathin'.

39:06.769 --> 39:10.047
- What do you mean, he's not breathing?
- [NICOLE]: I've got no pulse.

39:12.784 --> 39:15.385
Dispatch, this is Officer
Nicole Haught. Confirm.

39:15.387 --> 39:18.621
<i>- This is Dispatch.</i>
- I need paramedics off of Highway 12.

39:18.623 --> 39:21.337
I have an agent down.
Repeat: Agent down!

39:21.340 --> 39:23.893
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- Wynonna...

39:23.895 --> 39:26.062
[DOC]: Dammit, Dolls,
do not give up on us now!

39:26.064 --> 39:28.564
- Drugs. He needs his drugs.
- [WAVERLY]: No, no.

39:28.566 --> 39:30.090
He doesn't need his drugs.

39:30.093 --> 39:33.235
Xavier, goddammit! You
wake up! You wake up now!

39:33.238 --> 39:35.072
Waverly, why isn't he waking up?

39:37.676 --> 39:39.476
Because he's gone, Wynonna.

39:40.982 --> 39:42.349
He's gone.

39:55.086 --> 39:57.287
Nedley and the coroner
will be here soon.

39:58.689 --> 40:00.157
I'm not leaving him.

40:02.093 --> 40:03.393
Wynonna...

40:04.829 --> 40:07.930
Wynonna, it's freezing, you're
injured, okay? We have to...

40:07.932 --> 40:11.601
He hates the woods. I'm not
leaving him here alone, Waverly.

40:13.437 --> 40:14.504
Okay.

40:18.109 --> 40:20.710
Okay... no one's leaving him.

40:24.115 --> 40:25.515
That demon...

40:28.119 --> 40:30.619
...we cou... [SNIFFLING]

40:30.621 --> 40:34.141
...we couldn't stop him,
we couldn't... fight him.

40:34.144 --> 40:35.958
We were... we were about to die,

40:35.960 --> 40:37.127
and then...

40:40.531 --> 40:44.333
...Dolls... takes him on and...

40:44.335 --> 40:46.926
...flamethrows him like it's nothing.

40:48.256 --> 40:49.723
He saved us.

40:51.143 --> 40:52.543
He saved me.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.746
So how is this okay?

41:01.152 --> 41:03.620
- I don't know.
- How is he lying here?!!

41:05.990 --> 41:07.756
I don't know.

41:07.758 --> 41:09.359
I'm so sorry.

41:13.798 --> 41:14.998
Well...

41:16.567 --> 41:18.901
Maybe this is a mistake.

41:18.903 --> 41:20.569
Maybe he'll wake up.

41:20.571 --> 41:22.405
I mean, he's pa... he's...

41:23.307 --> 41:25.909
He's part dragon, he c-can...

41:30.915 --> 41:32.582
[MICHELLE]: Wynonna, honey...

41:34.819 --> 41:36.186
It's not fair.

41:38.389 --> 41:41.291
I can't... I can't do this without him.

41:42.526 --> 41:44.794
[WAVERLY AND MICHELLE]:
He's at peace now.

41:47.198 --> 41:48.798
There's no more pain.

41:50.268 --> 41:51.668
No more drugs.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.129
No more demons.

42:03.432 --> 42:06.868
You have to let him go now, Wynonna.
