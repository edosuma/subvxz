02:23.610 --> 02:26.875
And this display is all that's left
of CONTROL, a secret spy agency...

02:27.046 --> 02:30.743
...which once battled against
the criminal syndicate known as KAOS.

02:30.917 --> 02:33.647
CONTROL was disbanded
at the end of the Cold War.

02:34.087 --> 02:37.079
Okay, up next, an exhibit...

03:43.523 --> 03:47.789
Judy, the elevator is still doing that thing
where it drops really fast.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.622
Are you sure Maintenance fixed that?

03:49.796 --> 03:51.127
Let me check.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.060
Yep, they fixed it.

03:55.001 --> 03:56.298
See you later.

03:59.372 --> 04:01.135
- Hey, Max.
- Agent 50.

04:02.675 --> 04:04.768
16 floors down,
how'd a fly even get in here?

04:04.944 --> 04:06.309
- Hey, Max.
- Max!

04:06.479 --> 04:07.810
Hey, Larabee, 91.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.542
Yeah, big day. Could be
your last chance to push a pencil.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.549
Field-agent test results are due.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.815
Oh. Is that today?
I wasn't really thinking about it.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.425
Can you imagine Max as an agent?
Little suit, little shoes.

04:22.395 --> 04:23.384
Uh-oh. Two-nerd pile-up.

04:24.731 --> 04:26.860
- Move!
- Ow!

04:27.033 --> 04:29.797
Pretty boys. Nothing but empty suits.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.995
- Good morning, Bruce, Lloyd.
- Why would you wanna be an agent?

04:33.172 --> 04:36.938
I mean, lab guys like us, analysts like you,
we're the real soldiers.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.476
We're the true guardians
of freedom and democracy.

04:39.646 --> 04:42.114
And I hear we're getting
a new cappuccino machine.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.715
No, that's only for agents.

04:44.317 --> 04:45.443
Oh.

04:57.664 --> 05:00.258
Hey, Agent 23 is back.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.373
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.978
- Welcome back, 23.
- Maxie.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.012
So how was the assassination?

05:16.182 --> 05:18.980
Maxie, you know assassinations
are specifically prohibited...

05:19.152 --> 05:21.017
...by executive order 12333.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.155
23, you kill me.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.556
- I could if I wanted to.
- Yes, you... Oh. Oh!

05:28.728 --> 05:31.253
Did you see that face he made? Scary.

05:34.267 --> 05:37.600
Six months' work. 18 million dollars.

05:38.971 --> 05:40.905
Fricking agents, man.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.405
Come on, let's see it.

05:42.575 --> 05:47.376
A lot of chatter in this region
involves nuclear material.

05:47.547 --> 05:51.074
You may remember
from page 627 of my last report...

05:51.250 --> 05:54.048
...that there has been an uptick
in KAOS interest in nukes.

05:56.289 --> 05:59.122
To wit, I offer
the following conversation.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.453
What are you doing? Are you texting?

06:01.627 --> 06:04.858
Yeah, letting my fiancÃ©e know
we won't be able to get married in June.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.589
I'll still be in this meeting.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.125
Can I see that a second?
- Yeah.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.559
That's great.

06:11.904 --> 06:13.963
That's weird. You lost your signal.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.108
Sorry to interrupt, Maxie, go ahead.

06:16.642 --> 06:18.872
Next time use your own damn phone.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.306
Good morning, men. No, offense, Karen.

06:22.482 --> 06:23.744
Snappy tie.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.714
Sorry I'm late, but I just came out
of a budget meeting...

06:26.886 --> 06:30.879
...with our incredibly abrasive, dismissive
and sarcastic vice president.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.217
It's no problem.

06:32.392 --> 06:37.386
I have obtained a snippet,
at great risk to a busboy in Balahd.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.397
"Aftab, how is your coffee?"

06:44.370 --> 06:47.237
"Good, Dalip, it's decaf.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.371
How is yours?"

06:50.576 --> 06:52.669
"It is good also.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.377
How is your muffin?"

06:56.916 --> 06:58.281
Powerful stuff.

06:58.684 --> 07:01.118
So "muffin," then, is a code word?

07:01.287 --> 07:02.948
No, it is comfort food...

07:03.122 --> 07:05.989
...and quite frankly, more
fattening than most people realize.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.558
Which begs the question...

07:07.727 --> 07:11.891
...why would two
hardened KAOS agents...

07:12.064 --> 07:14.862
...risk the carbs?

07:15.868 --> 07:18.359
Because they are under
a great deal of stress.

07:18.538 --> 07:20.199
- Hence the decaf.
- For Aftab, yes.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.739
Dalip takes his full-strength. Why?

07:22.909 --> 07:25.707
Because he has been sleeping
on the couch for three days...

07:25.878 --> 07:29.170
...because he called his sister-in-law
a "leathery hag."

07:29.348 --> 07:32.174
People often say things
in anger they don't really mean.

07:32.351 --> 07:36.344
Leathery hag, fat cow, ungrateful whore.

07:36.522 --> 07:41.391
Just words, really, that shouldn't
be used against you in a custody hearing.

07:41.894 --> 07:45.125
Let it go, man. Those kids
don't even look like you.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.225
Can we put a pin in this, please...

07:47.400 --> 07:50.164
...and go back to Max's
extraordinarily detailed report?

07:50.336 --> 07:52.099
Thank you, Chief. All I'm saying is...

07:52.271 --> 07:55.138
...that until we understand
that our enemies are also human...

07:55.308 --> 07:56.969
...we will never defeat them.

07:57.143 --> 08:02.809
Yes, they are bad guys, but that
is what they do, not who they are.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.878
Let's continue listening...

08:05.051 --> 08:08.919
...and bear in mind that the next 100 pages
can get a little bit dry.

08:09.088 --> 08:10.885
Come on...

08:22.468 --> 08:25.460
Easy, Durat! This stuff is radioactive.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.606
One slip-up, and it's "ka-fricking-boom!"

08:27.773 --> 08:28.933
Shtarker.

08:30.276 --> 08:34.178
This is KAOS.
We don't "ka-fricking-boom" here.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.307
Sorry, Mr. Siegfried.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.918
Get it in the truck,
and let's burn this place to the ground.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.577
But if we have what we want,
why burn the building?

08:49.962 --> 08:52.226
Any more questions?

09:16.322 --> 09:17.448
Missed me!

09:19.792 --> 09:22.886
All right! All right! I'm out!

09:23.062 --> 09:25.053
He was lying, Max. It was a good shot.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.528
Thanks.

09:26.699 --> 09:29.395
I am so sick of training.
I wanna get out in the field.

09:29.569 --> 09:33.335
Give it up, 23! It's just you
and Maxi-pad against the six of us.

09:33.506 --> 09:36.737
Oh, gee, Maxi-pad,
I've never heard that one before!

09:37.176 --> 09:39.144
I never have actually heard that before.

09:46.185 --> 09:47.379
23, you're bleeding.

09:47.853 --> 09:51.448
It's a knife wound from the last mission.
My blood gets pumping, it seeps.

09:51.624 --> 09:52.989
Hey, Maxine!

09:53.159 --> 09:55.889
Come over here
and we'll play a game I like to call:

09:56.062 --> 09:57.927
"Let's Go to the Dog Show."

09:58.097 --> 10:00.224
I put a collar on you
and make you my bi...!

10:05.104 --> 10:07.273
I think I really got inside his head.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.104
I am not proud of what I just did.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.902
Game over, Chatty Cathy.

10:16.515 --> 10:18.915
Game over when I say it's over.

10:19.385 --> 10:20.875
- Okay.
- Wet willy.

10:22.688 --> 10:24.383
Okay. Who wants lunch?

10:24.557 --> 10:27.924
Well, excellent work, 23,
but I could've handled it my...

10:31.030 --> 10:34.466
- Max, the Chief wants to see you.
- It is nice to see you too!

10:41.907 --> 10:43.272
You wanted to see me, Chief?

10:43.442 --> 10:45.910
Yes, Max, yes, please, sit down.

10:46.078 --> 10:49.605
Your field-agent test results
just came in and...

10:51.017 --> 10:53.679
- Something wrong with your ear?
- Absolutely not.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.287
Would you like me
to wait while you answer that?

10:56.455 --> 10:57.547
Answer what?

10:57.723 --> 10:59.657
Nothing. You were saying?

10:59.825 --> 11:02.225
I was saying the results
are quite extraordinary.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.387
In fact, your essay on existentialism
was quite amazing.

11:05.564 --> 11:07.088
I left that section blank.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.063
Blank? Brilliant.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.725
Brilliant, Max.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.565
- You passed with flying colors.
- Yes!

11:13.739 --> 11:16.230
You know what, sir?
I can't say that I am shocked.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.139
I felt good about this year's test,
in light of the fact...

11:19.311 --> 11:22.007
...that in previous years,
my fitness has been an issue.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.546
Personal best.

11:30.723 --> 11:33.624
But not anymore. I'm ready for duty.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.920
I know how hard
you've prepared for this...

11:36.095 --> 11:37.892
...and how much this means to you...

11:38.064 --> 11:40.225
...but I'm afraid I can't promote you.

11:40.399 --> 11:43.926
- What?
- I can't afford to give up my best analyst.

11:44.103 --> 11:47.300
I mean, the amount of chatter
you get through, and the reports...

11:47.473 --> 11:49.600
...I mean, they go way beyond
the raw data.

11:50.309 --> 11:56.373
So to be clear, you're not promoting me,
because I do such a great job.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.652
Max, the way you and I work
is becoming a lost art form.

12:00.820 --> 12:03.618
I spend half my days
trying to convince the vice president...

12:03.789 --> 12:06.587
...that intelligence comes
from humans and not satellites.

12:06.759 --> 12:10.195
Men with hunches,
that's where the real work gets done.

12:10.362 --> 12:12.296
I'm very proud of you, Max...

12:12.832 --> 12:14.993
...very proud of you...

12:15.167 --> 12:17.032
...but I need you where you are.

12:41.026 --> 12:43.324
<i>I am sorry, but we can never be.</i>

12:43.496 --> 12:47.523
Despite today's setback,
I will at some point become a field agent...

12:47.700 --> 12:48.962
...and when that happens...

12:49.135 --> 12:52.400
...one phone call could take me
to the other side of the world.

12:53.005 --> 12:56.839
Who am I kidding? I'm a middle-aged
man who's missed the train.

12:57.510 --> 13:01.139
You don't deserve this.
I don't deserve you.

13:01.313 --> 13:03.781
You're so young and so full of life.

13:04.850 --> 13:05.976
Don't do it, Fang.

13:06.852 --> 13:08.149
Don't love me.

13:10.656 --> 13:11.953
Here.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.092
- Oh, great.
- Sorry.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.728
That was my last mile.
I have no idea how fast it was.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.228
You were moving.
It's not easy to knock me down.

13:19.398 --> 13:21.628
I have a low center of gravity.
Pretty solid.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.133
I'm just gonna call that one a 4:50.

13:24.303 --> 13:28.296
Impressive. I once ran a 5:16.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.341
Oh, really? That's, uh, slower.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.000
Not everything's a competition.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.008
Well, if it were, I'd win.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.376
Ah. Are you flirting with me?

13:38.450 --> 13:40.543
Not at all. Are you flirting with me?

13:40.719 --> 13:42.482
That depends. Is it working?

13:43.022 --> 13:44.853
Not at all.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.492
Well, nice meeting you!
I admire your focus!

13:51.096 --> 13:52.688
Am I invisible?

14:28.567 --> 14:31.365
Bruce, Lloyd, what happened?

14:31.537 --> 14:34.062
And what is that ungodly smell?

14:34.440 --> 14:35.737
Fear.

14:37.476 --> 14:38.773
I'll be back.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.009
Freeze.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.482
Freeze.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.644
- No, you freeze.
- You freeze.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.949
- I told you to freeze.
- Freeze times infinity.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.421
Oh, my God.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.625
- You.
- You.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.591
- Are you CONTROL?
- I'm Maxwell Smart.

14:57.763 --> 14:59.731
I am a CONTROL analyst. Who are you?

15:01.500 --> 15:03.058
I'm Agent 99.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.432
Oh, my word. You are Agent 99?

15:06.605 --> 15:09.335
- I am a huge fan!
- Thank you.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.614
What are you doing?

15:22.321 --> 15:23.811
I'm right here, just talk to me!

15:23.989 --> 15:26.423
I'm going to cause a diversion.
You run and get help.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.560
- I really don't think that that's a...
- Shh.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.661
- Did you just...?
- Shh!

15:48.847 --> 15:50.041
Go, go, go!

15:50.549 --> 15:51.573
Wait!

15:54.019 --> 15:55.384
Somebody shut it off!

16:03.362 --> 16:06.126
Good, 23, just in time.
I think I got one of them.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.759
Is that the Chief?

16:11.203 --> 16:12.830
Yes, it is.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.233
Sorry about that, Chief.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.831
Is that a dent in his head?

16:33.726 --> 16:35.421
Hi. Hi.

16:35.594 --> 16:38.427
Agent 13, you are in a tree.

16:38.597 --> 16:41.862
Yeah, communications got knocked down,
so they put me in a tree.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.025
- Old-school stuff.
- Glad to see you're okay.

16:44.203 --> 16:45.227
Yeah, yeah.

16:45.771 --> 16:49.104
Well, I have to get going.
Would you raise up the walkway, please?

16:49.274 --> 16:51.572
You don't have to get going.
You don't have to go.

16:51.744 --> 16:52.938
Yeah, I've got a meeting.

16:53.112 --> 16:54.704
- How you been?
- I've been well.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.610
- Everything good?
- It's great. Well, I gotta...

16:57.783 --> 16:59.375
Could you come back this way?

17:00.586 --> 17:02.247
Yeah, yeah, I think I will.

17:02.588 --> 17:03.919
What time?

17:04.390 --> 17:06.915
Well... Mm.

17:07.326 --> 17:09.055
I get it.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.153
Who wants to talk to a guy in a tree?

17:12.330 --> 17:13.627
I get it.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.531
Hang in there.
Don't cry, don't... Please don't cry.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.650
Okay. Let's get started.

17:40.826 --> 17:43.488
You'll have to bear with me,
I'm still a little fuzzy.

17:43.662 --> 17:46.130
I got a pretty good
hit in the head yesterday.

17:46.298 --> 17:50.291
Yes, it was dark in there.
You probably tripped.

17:50.469 --> 17:53.529
I hurt my knee. It was smoky too.

17:54.973 --> 17:57.032
All right, here's what we know.

17:57.209 --> 18:00.007
Wait. Chief, I request
the cone of silence.

18:00.179 --> 18:03.910
Max, not the cone of silence.
We're in a safe room, for God's sakes.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.675
We thought CONTROL was safe.

18:06.452 --> 18:07.783
Okay. Lloyd.

18:11.723 --> 18:15.557
Okay, we have reason to believe
that our security was breached by KAOS.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.991
- You have to speak up.
- Can you hear me?

18:18.163 --> 18:19.994
- I'm not hearing anyone.
- What?

18:20.165 --> 18:22.099
Can you hear me?
- What did you say?

18:22.267 --> 18:24.827
- Bruce, it's not working.
- It's not working!

18:26.105 --> 18:28.903
Chief! I hit you in the head
with a fire extinguisher!

18:29.074 --> 18:31.042
No, no, no, we're not ready yet.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.144
Okay. All right.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.576
- It doesn't work, get rid of it.
- Turn it off.

18:35.747 --> 18:38.341
This thing is no good.
It's a useless piece of garbage.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.678
- Turn it off!
- Larabee, you all right?

18:40.853 --> 18:42.787
Larabee wants out!

18:47.526 --> 18:50.324
Today's the day, and we're gonna
get rid of this damn thing.

18:50.496 --> 18:53.090
That is cold. That's cold.
- All right, easy.

18:53.265 --> 18:54.892
All right, are we done?

18:55.067 --> 18:56.432
Yep. I can hear now.

18:56.602 --> 18:59.696
Sorry, Chief, someone led me to believe
the cone was ready.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.568
For the record, I never actually
used the word "ready."

19:02.741 --> 19:05.301
"I'll show them the cone.
The cone's the shizzle."

19:05.477 --> 19:06.876
- You said that to me.
- All right, shut up.

19:07.579 --> 19:08.603
Listen up, people.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.112
There's been a rash of thefts
of nuclear material...

19:11.283 --> 19:13.717
...especially yellowcake,
over the last three months.

19:13.886 --> 19:18.516
Now, based on Max's intel, we were
able to get Agent 38 inside KAOS.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.885
We must've been close
to uncovering something...

19:21.059 --> 19:22.890
...so KAOS hit us and they hit us hard.

19:23.061 --> 19:24.852
They hacked our system...

19:25.030 --> 19:27.730
...and learned the identities
of all our field agents.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.959
Around the world
our people are under attack.

19:37.342 --> 19:41.039
Our only lead is the maker of the bomb
KAOS used against us.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.737
Vladimir Krs...

19:42.915 --> 19:44.849
- It's pronounced "Krstic," sir.
- Yes...

19:46.218 --> 19:47.583
Krstic.

19:49.087 --> 19:53.421
Yes. He is a Bosnian national, and one
of KAOS' favorite munitions suppliers.

19:53.592 --> 19:56.390
Unfortunately, we have no idea
where he is.

19:56.562 --> 19:58.689
Actually, sir, we do. He is in Russia.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.890
- How do you know that?
- It was on page 482 of my report.

20:04.236 --> 20:05.863
Doesn't anybody read my reports?

20:07.105 --> 20:10.563
All right, our mission is clear, people.
Find Krs...

20:10.742 --> 20:12.334
- Krstic.
- Yes. Find him!

20:12.511 --> 20:14.502
- Kris Kringle. Fish stick.
- Yes, Krs...

20:14.680 --> 20:16.272
- Okay, I got it, I got it.
- Krstic.

20:16.448 --> 20:20.043
Use him to get to KAOS,
then recover the stolen nuclear material...

20:20.219 --> 20:22.653
...before they can do something
less than friendly...

20:22.821 --> 20:26.780
...and maybe, if we're lucky,
we can apprehend the man behind it all...

20:26.959 --> 20:28.051
...Siegfried.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.128
Pictured here with his
number two man, Shtarker.

20:31.296 --> 20:34.129
How are we gonna do that
when our agents are compromised?

20:34.299 --> 20:37.166
Put me out there, Chief.
I'm not afraid to expose myself.

20:37.336 --> 20:39.395
Do you ever think before you speak?

20:39.571 --> 20:41.971
No, I just whip it out there.
It's what's best.

20:42.140 --> 20:43.801
Fortunately, we have other options.

20:43.976 --> 20:48.743
99 recently underwent massive plastic
surgery, so her new face is not known yet.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.849
We also have a new agent, Agent 86.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.279
Who's that, sir?

20:53.452 --> 20:55.079
It's you, Max.

20:56.888 --> 20:58.515
All right, Maxie.

20:59.791 --> 21:00.815
You did it.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.524
Lloyd, may I have the C.O.S. please?

21:09.334 --> 21:10.528
I'm so happy!

21:10.702 --> 21:14.798
I'm so happy!
This is the best day of my life!

21:17.042 --> 21:20.478
Max, you didn't push
the button hard enough.

21:20.646 --> 21:23.137
- So you could hear me?
- Yes.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.315
- Right.
- Excuse me, Chief, just a thought.

21:26.485 --> 21:30.421
- I'm not questioning your judgment...
- 99, I insist on complete honesty.

21:30.589 --> 21:33.615
If you have something to say to me,
I wish you would just say it.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.124
Max has no experience.
I don't want him as my partner.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.696
Well, that is a sucker punch
to the gonads.

21:42.200 --> 21:46.136
Hey, Max. We got you a lovely
parting gift for your first mission.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.569
Oh, a pocketknife.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.072
Not just a pocketknife, Swiss Army knife.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.734
Comes with tweezers, pliers,
a tiny magnifying glass.

21:53.912 --> 21:57.075
Fish scaler, a saw, a flamethrower,
chisel, a wire-crimping tool.

21:57.249 --> 21:59.114
- What was that thing you said?
- Chisel?

21:59.284 --> 22:01.047
Before that.
Did you say flamethrower?

22:01.219 --> 22:02.550
- Yeah.
- Check it.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.351
We also added a crossbow
that fires harpoons...

22:07.526 --> 22:11.257
...connected to spider-silk nano-thread.
Has the strength of steel cable.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.921
It's a time-consuming,
labor-intensive technology.

22:14.099 --> 22:16.226
The spiders
have to be individually milked.

22:16.401 --> 22:18.369
And they do not like it.

22:18.537 --> 22:19.868
No, they don't.

22:20.038 --> 22:22.006
Gentlemen, you're the best.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.531
Thanks.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.992
Ladies and gentlemen,
while you are in your seats...

22:43.161 --> 22:45.356
...please keep your seatbelts fastened.

22:46.264 --> 22:48.858
I feel really good about us as partners.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.729
23 says that's important.

22:51.470 --> 22:54.098
"Trust is a must." That's what 23 says.

22:54.272 --> 22:55.296
Does he?

22:55.474 --> 22:58.466
You and I share a bond, I think.

22:58.643 --> 23:02.807
We both know what it feels like to look
in the mirror and not like what we see.

23:02.981 --> 23:05.779
You with the surgery,
me with the weight loss.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.042
I wanna show you something.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.316
That was me.

23:13.492 --> 23:15.392
Wow, impressive.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.221
Congratulations.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.886
Thank you.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.435
This is me.

23:25.270 --> 23:26.999
Wow.

23:27.172 --> 23:29.072
Very impressive, 99.

23:29.775 --> 23:32.335
You were truly hideous back then.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.438
Since we are going
to be portraying husband and wife...

23:37.616 --> 23:39.982
...maybe we should get our story set.

23:40.318 --> 23:41.808
Okay, good idea.

23:43.688 --> 23:48.182
We met at a marketing convention in Vegas.
Married a year later. No kids.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.260
I like your parents, but you hate mine.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.794
Do we want kids?

23:51.963 --> 23:54.830
Well, you do,
but I'm concentrating on my career.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.764
I don't know if that's fair.
I mean, I'm older than you are.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.962
- Well, not by much.
- Really?

24:02.541 --> 24:05.874
When they gave me a new face,
I had them...

24:06.711 --> 24:08.804
...take a couple years off.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.470
You know, why not?

24:11.316 --> 24:16.015
Well, if that's the case, then you are
at an advanced age, and you should be...

24:16.188 --> 24:17.985
Well, no. I was never...

24:18.156 --> 24:22.354
I'm just saying that your eggs could dry up
and fall out of your uterus.

24:22.527 --> 24:24.893
So time is of the essence.

24:25.997 --> 24:28.966
- That's your opinion.
- No, that is a medical fact.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.830
There is a lot of time
for me to make this decision.

24:32.003 --> 24:34.403
I will not be rushed into it
by you or my mother.

24:34.573 --> 24:37.007
- You don't have much time.
- Where is the drink cart?

24:41.713 --> 24:42.702
Uh-oh.

24:42.881 --> 24:44.644
- What?
- Six o'clock.

24:45.517 --> 24:49.112
Don't turn around, don't turn around.
Use your peripherals.

24:53.558 --> 24:54.889
Do you see him?

24:55.160 --> 24:58.425
I'm just widening my eyes.
I'm not actually seeing anything more.

24:58.597 --> 25:01.031
The big guy that might as well
be holding up a sign:

25:01.199 --> 25:02.996
"I'm an assassin, here to kill you."

25:03.168 --> 25:05.568
Okay, 99, you know what?
That is profiling.

25:05.737 --> 25:10.367
Just because he is large doesn't
necessarily mean that he is a bad guy.

25:12.277 --> 25:14.837
Oh. Wow.

25:15.013 --> 25:18.107
That's a bad guy.
That's a really bad guy.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.046
- You don't say.
- Did you see his face?

25:20.218 --> 25:21.242
Yes.

25:21.419 --> 25:24.786
His head looks like
one of the Easter Island heads.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.016
You know what?
I'm doing the same thing.

25:29.194 --> 25:32.061
That's profiling,
and I will have none of it.

25:32.230 --> 25:36.064
Darn it, I have gum on my new shoes.

25:41.072 --> 25:43.404
- He's trying to light his shoe.
- It's a shoe bomb!

25:43.575 --> 25:44.837
- Get him!
- It's gum.

25:45.010 --> 25:48.502
- He's got a gun!
- Not... Gum! Not... No! Gum!

25:51.716 --> 25:53.274
Gum!

25:53.451 --> 25:55.476
Federal marshal, you're under arrest.

25:55.654 --> 25:59.055
Sir, I believe you just shattered
my coccyx.

26:00.358 --> 26:03.088
<i>Folks, we may</i>
<i>be experiencing a little turbulence.</i>

26:03.261 --> 26:05.821
<i>The "fasten seatbelt" sign</i>
<i>has been turned on.</i>

26:07.666 --> 26:10.430
Well, you were no help whatsoever.

26:10.602 --> 26:14.299
How could I help?
I'm just a woman with a dusty old uterus.

26:14.472 --> 26:16.770
I never said dusty.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.468
We're close to the drop site.
I'll go first.

26:19.644 --> 26:22.670
- Gonna be all right with your cuffs?
- No cuffs can contain me.

26:24.482 --> 26:26.473
Excuse me, violent sky marshal.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.647
What do you want?

26:28.820 --> 26:30.287
I have to squeeze the lemon.

26:30.455 --> 26:31.945
Ugh.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.823
You heard me.

26:33.992 --> 26:36.187
Squeeze the lemon.

26:49.307 --> 26:52.708
- Do you work out?
- Occasionally.

26:52.877 --> 26:55.038
Yeah, I'm big on protein. Protein's great.

27:08.159 --> 27:11.026
I gotta get it out. I gotta get that out!

27:12.998 --> 27:15.899
That's in there, that's in there.

27:24.676 --> 27:26.337
No time for pain.

27:26.511 --> 27:28.206
Over the drop zone.

27:34.419 --> 27:36.250
Ball sack!

27:45.730 --> 27:47.357
Son of a hamster.

27:47.532 --> 27:49.762
You all right in there?
- Yeah. Yes, I am.

27:50.035 --> 27:51.195
Everything's fine.

27:51.369 --> 27:53.428
Mother of pearl!

28:00.779 --> 28:02.337
That burns!

28:02.514 --> 28:03.845
Last chance.

28:07.419 --> 28:11.116
<i>Airlock activated. Three, two, one.</i>

28:15.694 --> 28:17.525
First package away.

28:25.103 --> 28:27.037
Absolutely, I love cats.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.229
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:34.412 --> 28:35.879
Damn.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.292
Second package away.

29:09.814 --> 29:11.748
Oh, good, you heard me.

29:14.619 --> 29:16.484
Third package away.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.613
Third package?

29:24.863 --> 29:26.990
99, Easter Island.

29:34.205 --> 29:39.040
- I'll be right back!
- Where could you possibly be going?

30:04.035 --> 30:07.266
Okay, never do that again!

30:07.438 --> 30:09.463
Stop hanging on me!
- Never! Stop it!

30:15.814 --> 30:19.477
Max, I can't reach my reserve!
Do something!

30:27.158 --> 30:29.524
That would have definitely
worked on me.

30:29.694 --> 30:34.063
Are you crazy?
If I can't pull my chute, you'll die too!

30:54.252 --> 30:55.913
Aim for the haystack.
- Stop talking.

30:56.087 --> 30:58.851
- Aim for the haystack, it's softer.
- Stop talking!

31:00.625 --> 31:02.024
You missed it.

31:30.288 --> 31:32.916
Okay, not to keep dwelling on this...

31:33.091 --> 31:35.423
...but that was some kiss.

31:35.593 --> 31:37.117
How did you know that would work?

31:37.295 --> 31:39.957
Have you kissed other men
who plummeted to their deaths?

31:40.131 --> 31:41.155
Okay, you know what?

31:41.332 --> 31:45.735
So far, our entire partnership has consisted
of me getting you out of trouble.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.168
Do you know why?
It is because you keep leading.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.801
So here's how we stop that. I lead now.

31:50.975 --> 31:53.102
I'm the one with experience.
You know nothing.

31:53.444 --> 31:54.968
I beg to differ.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.842
I looked up your field agent exam,
and I scored...

31:58.016 --> 32:00.007
- My what?
- Your field agent exam.

32:00.184 --> 32:01.947
I scored eight points higher than you.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.212
This is not a classroom.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.913
That's the difference between
an A plus and an A minus.

32:06.090 --> 32:09.821
- You'll get us killed if you don't listen!
- A minus!

32:10.595 --> 32:13.428
Okay, you're faced with an assassin.
What do you do?

32:13.598 --> 32:17.034
- I take out my gun, and I would shoot...
- You don't have a gun.

32:17.201 --> 32:18.964
- I did until you took it.
- Bang. You're dead.

32:19.137 --> 32:20.365
- No, I'm not.
- Bang. You're dead.

32:20.538 --> 32:21.800
- Stop shooting me.
- You are dead.

32:21.973 --> 32:23.941
- I don't like it when you shoot me.
- Bang. Bang. Bang.

32:24.108 --> 32:25.268
- Stop it.
- Bang. Bang.

32:25.443 --> 32:28.606
Stop shooting me more.
You already said I was... Hey.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.637
Throw out your manual.

32:30.815 --> 32:34.216
Out here there are no grades,
there's only dead, and not dead.

32:35.320 --> 32:39.347
You know, I am not completely
incompetent without a gun.

32:39.524 --> 32:42.550
I am a master in the art of Hwa Rang Do.

32:45.897 --> 32:48.024
- I was not ready.
- That's my point.

32:48.199 --> 32:49.496
Yeah, you know what? That...

32:49.667 --> 32:51.828
Hey, what was that?

32:56.908 --> 33:00.639
Max is halfway to Moscow. Don't tell me
you're still translating that Russian.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.370
They talk fast, it's hard.

33:03.514 --> 33:06.039
It takes like eight of these morons
to do what Max did.

33:06.217 --> 33:08.412
I can't wait till we finish
the Hymie project.

33:08.586 --> 33:10.611
All these stupid agents will be obsolete.

33:10.788 --> 33:12.278
- Bye-bye.
- What's a Hymie?

33:12.457 --> 33:15.551
Hybrid Mechanical Intelligence Entity.
Basically a robot.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.661
It's a stolen KAOS technology.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.229
Being reprogrammed. Top-secret.
Need-to-know.

33:20.398 --> 33:22.093
And you don't need.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.765
I'm a trained killer.
I can kill you with anything in this office.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.906
You wanna die by Post-its?
Because I could make that happen.

33:29.073 --> 33:30.768
And that's a slow death.

33:32.276 --> 33:33.607
Larabee.
- Yeah.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.507
- Were you the last one to use the copier?
- Yeah.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.840
You left it jammed.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.347
So? Why don't you...

33:39.717 --> 33:41.014
...unjam it?

33:41.185 --> 33:44.177
- Just open the door, read the instructions.
- This your stapler?

33:44.355 --> 33:46.915
- Yeah, want me to show you how to use it?
- No.

33:48.659 --> 33:49.683
Unjam that.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.089
- 23.
- Yes.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.787
- Can I have a moment, please?
- Sure.

33:54.432 --> 33:55.626
Yes, Chief.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.963
Let me tell you about a pattern
that's beginning to emerge.

33:59.137 --> 34:01.332
As a former field agent,
I'm very much aware...

34:01.506 --> 34:04.600
...of how difficult it is
to make the transition to office life.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.300
He didn't unjam the copier.

34:06.477 --> 34:09.742
We have rules here. If you don't
follow the rules, then what are we?

34:09.914 --> 34:14.078
I'll tell you what we're not. We're not
people who jam staples into people's heads.

34:14.252 --> 34:15.879
That's CIA crap.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.248
All right, look, Chief, I'm your best guy.

34:18.422 --> 34:21.915
I don't belong in an office making copies.
I should be out there with Max.

34:22.092 --> 34:24.527
Look, 23, no more stapling today.

34:25.963 --> 34:27.260
Just hold on.

34:33.603 --> 34:35.663
So how do you know this place?

34:35.840 --> 34:38.138
Well, as an analyst,
I like to keep my ears open.

34:38.309 --> 34:39.708
It's amazing what you learn...

34:39.877 --> 34:43.677
...listening to chatter.
In fact, Ladislas Krstic loves this place.

34:43.848 --> 34:48.784
As do many KAOS agents.
CafÃ© Minsk-Pinsk in Smolensk.

34:48.953 --> 34:51.148
It doesn't get any better than "thinsk."

34:52.523 --> 34:54.491
You see what I just did?

34:54.659 --> 34:57.287
I added an "insk" at the end,
made it sound Russian.

34:57.462 --> 34:59.020
Should've smacked you harder.

34:59.197 --> 35:00.528
Is that your default setting?

35:00.698 --> 35:03.166
Do you just punch people
in the face willy-nilly?

35:03.334 --> 35:05.302
"It's Tuesday,
I'll punch Max in the face."

35:05.470 --> 35:08.166
"A box of kittens,
time to punch Max in the face."

35:08.339 --> 35:10.671
"I'm having bread,
time to punch Max in the face."

35:10.842 --> 35:12.366
You know, I love bread...

35:12.543 --> 35:14.875
...and I know bread
has a few carbs, but...

35:15.046 --> 35:17.105
...l've never really been afraid of carbs...

35:17.281 --> 35:21.718
...because it seems like no matter
how many I eat, I stay "thinsk."

35:36.968 --> 35:39.163
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

35:39.337 --> 35:41.066
No <i>sprechen Sie</i> Russian.

36:25.149 --> 36:28.118
Boy, you know what? I will tell you,
I love your country.

36:28.286 --> 36:31.585
No more Communism.
No rules of any kind, really.

36:31.756 --> 36:35.419
I'm filling my suitcase with steroids
and art from ancient Mesopotamia.

36:35.593 --> 36:39.222
Ran over an old woman yesterday.
Best vacation I've ever had.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.925
Time to take my pill.

36:51.409 --> 36:53.741
There was a guy in the bathroom
who's really hot.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.903
Okay...

36:57.081 --> 36:59.208
No, no, no. Radioactive hot.

36:59.383 --> 37:02.648
Although he did have a certain
rugged quality that some find appealing.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.788
How did you know he was radioactive?

37:05.156 --> 37:08.648
My watch is a Geiger counter.
You don't have one of these? Huh.

37:09.093 --> 37:12.062
Listen, I think he was part
of the nuclear theft in Chechnya.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.424
We should follow him.

37:13.598 --> 37:15.225
I gotta say, Max...

37:15.967 --> 37:17.434
...you picked a good restaurant.

37:55.439 --> 37:56.531
Of course.

37:57.341 --> 37:58.774
Tripe soup.

37:58.943 --> 38:02.037
- This must be Ladislas Krstic's house.
- What?

38:02.213 --> 38:05.774
Tripe soup is his favorite dish.
It was in the mission dossier.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.043
Let's just see what we're
up against, okay?

38:16.627 --> 38:18.618
I didn't get to eat at the restaurant.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.993
And if you skip a meal,
the next meal you overindulge.

38:22.166 --> 38:24.225
- Well, let me. I've got nails.
- It's a recipe for...

38:26.170 --> 38:27.501
You owe me $3.

38:29.373 --> 38:32.536
More guards.
We'll have to figure out a way in.

38:38.449 --> 38:39.473
Miniature blowgun.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.845
You don't have one of these?

38:42.019 --> 38:46.080
These darts are tipped with a tranquilizer
derived from the skin of a lizard...

38:46.257 --> 38:48.384
...known as <i>los zapatos de la muerte.</i>

38:48.559 --> 38:49.651
"The shoes of death."

38:50.561 --> 38:51.858
Excuse me.

38:52.396 --> 38:55.593
They're 40 yards out,
that's definitely the edge of my range.

38:55.766 --> 38:59.429
I'm going to have to give this one
a little something extra.

39:15.152 --> 39:16.676
Wow.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.412
You look spectacular.

39:18.589 --> 39:19.715
Thanks.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.855
You don't look too bad yourself.

39:23.127 --> 39:24.389
Is that a wig?

39:24.562 --> 39:26.086
Yeah, it came with the dress.

39:26.764 --> 39:30.791
- How did I get into these clothes?
- That's not important. Let's go.

39:34.071 --> 39:35.368
Am I wearing boxers?

39:38.409 --> 39:41.640
For future reference,
I usually prefer briefs...

39:41.812 --> 39:44.246
...for their security and peace of mind.

39:44.415 --> 39:46.747
Going free-bird is not exactly ideal.

39:47.084 --> 39:48.745
I don't like it.

40:04.635 --> 40:06.569
There must be 200 people here.

40:06.737 --> 40:09.831
Finding Krstic will be like
finding a needle in a haystack.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.011
I'd love to dance.

40:20.184 --> 40:24.143
English? But you understand Russian?
Very impressive.

40:24.822 --> 40:26.414
Shall we?

40:27.258 --> 40:28.953
I hope your date doesn't mind.

40:29.126 --> 40:31.026
Oh, he's not my date.

40:31.195 --> 40:34.358
He's just a local horse groomer
I hired to drive me around.

40:34.532 --> 40:38.525
It's a tragic story. He's quite deaf.
Really not bright.

40:39.470 --> 40:43.031
I am going to dance now.

40:43.340 --> 40:47.276
You go get yourself some punch.

40:48.512 --> 40:49.945
Okay.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.650
I don't even know
how much gets through.

41:02.526 --> 41:04.016
Chief, I need your help.

41:04.195 --> 41:05.526
You're on. Go ahead.

41:05.696 --> 41:06.822
<i>We have found Krstic.</i>

41:06.997 --> 41:09.557
<i>I searched his house.</i>
<i>I can't find his computer network.</i>

41:09.733 --> 41:11.362
Get me an infrared satellite scan.

41:11.535 --> 41:14.629
I have to get back to 99,
she is in grave danger.

41:17.908 --> 41:19.808
Your house is so beautiful.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.544
It must be difficult to go to work.

41:23.547 --> 41:25.981
I don't have to go very far.

42:01.652 --> 42:03.381
I don't think so.

42:03.721 --> 42:05.279
I wasn't talking to you.

42:09.560 --> 42:10.584
Me?

42:12.363 --> 42:13.523
I don't know.

42:13.697 --> 42:15.255
It'll be fun.

42:15.666 --> 42:16.690
Trust me.

43:08.519 --> 43:10.316
You are so light on your feet.

43:10.487 --> 43:11.920
I recently lost 150 pounds.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.053
So did I.

43:14.224 --> 43:16.454
Isn't it great?
I have so much more energy now.

43:16.627 --> 43:18.094
Me too.

44:24.828 --> 44:27.023
- Thanks for jumping.
- No problem.

44:50.888 --> 44:52.913
Thank you for the lovely dance.

45:14.678 --> 45:16.543
Did you see anything
while I was dancing?

45:16.714 --> 45:20.081
Just once, but I don't think you expected
him to lift you so high.

45:21.452 --> 45:24.478
Anyway, I found out that the office
is in the guest house.

45:24.655 --> 45:26.247
Really? How'd you do that?

45:26.423 --> 45:29.085
Show him a little dÃ©colletage,
cleavage, bat your eyes?

45:29.259 --> 45:31.250
I'm not judging, just detecting a pattern.

45:31.428 --> 45:33.794
- Ready to work?
- I'm ready to work. You ready?

45:33.964 --> 45:35.898
- Oh, my God.
- You're just having fun showing your:

45:44.408 --> 45:46.672
Six guards.
We are going to need another way in.

45:46.844 --> 45:49.005
Stand by, Max. Larabee, let's go. Move it.

45:49.446 --> 45:51.573
- What'd you do?
- I can't find the right screen.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.944
It was here a second ago,
then it went away.

45:54.118 --> 45:56.780
- What did you hit?
- Don't yell at me. It's not helping!

45:56.954 --> 45:58.421
If you don't find that screen...

45:58.589 --> 46:01.524
...l'm gonna have you hunting
for land mines, with a hammer!

46:04.528 --> 46:06.519
<i>Got it, Max. There is one other entrance.</i>

46:06.697 --> 46:07.755
What kind of entrance?

46:07.931 --> 46:10.832
The kind where you'll wanna
throw your shoes out afterwards.

46:11.502 --> 46:15.495
Oh, great, rats.
It's not enough that there's poop.

46:15.672 --> 46:20.609
You know what, I never saw James Bond
in rats or poop, let alone rats and poop.

46:21.478 --> 46:24.379
Look, a rat riding on a piece of poop.

46:24.548 --> 46:27.278
Stop it. It's just a storm drain.

46:31.555 --> 46:32.988
Here it is.

46:44.368 --> 46:47.997
Exploding dental floss.
You don't have this? Hm.

46:57.581 --> 46:59.481
Three, two...

47:00.150 --> 47:01.174
...one.

47:24.074 --> 47:25.701
Right.

47:31.548 --> 47:32.708
Come on.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.232
Are you staring at my butt?

47:52.102 --> 47:53.899
No, I am not.

47:54.071 --> 47:56.403
I might have been before, but I am...

47:56.573 --> 47:59.303
Now I am again. All right, I'm stopping.

47:59.476 --> 48:02.536
Pay attention to what I'm doing,
so that you can follow me exactly.

48:02.946 --> 48:04.208
Yep.

48:24.635 --> 48:26.899
Okay, Max. Little heads-up.

48:27.070 --> 48:30.130
High-intensity lasers. Whatever
part of you does touch gets sliced.

48:30.307 --> 48:33.470
One more reason
why boxers were a bad idea.

48:45.756 --> 48:48.156
All right, so do I have to do it
exactly like that?

48:48.325 --> 48:49.519
Just come on.

49:03.240 --> 49:05.640
That's impressive. Wow.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.640
Careful, this one's tricky.

49:09.813 --> 49:11.280
Good.

49:11.448 --> 49:12.472
Very good.

49:14.685 --> 49:15.845
Okay, it's not that good.

49:35.539 --> 49:36.733
Max. Max.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.236
Stay calm.

49:40.143 --> 49:42.839
Max, keep it together. Keep it together.

49:43.880 --> 49:45.404
Max. Max.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.576
Careful! No, no.

49:48.752 --> 49:50.652
He's nibbling. That's not cheese!

49:52.456 --> 49:53.684
Max, be quiet!

50:01.999 --> 50:03.990
Okay, shall we?

50:42.439 --> 50:43.929
Did I hear something?

50:44.107 --> 50:47.377
Yes, there were some
tap dancers in the hallway.

50:49.713 --> 50:52.807
Damn it. I can't get into their system.
Biometric security.

50:52.983 --> 50:54.746
If you don't mind, 99...

50:59.956 --> 51:04.052
The old "steam sticks to everything
but the oil from the last thumb print" trick.

51:04.227 --> 51:05.251
Here we go.

51:05.495 --> 51:08.726
- Shipments of explosives.
- Your boyfriend is a very bad man.

51:08.899 --> 51:12.062
- And a really good kisser.
- Ignoring that.

51:15.172 --> 51:17.902
Look at that shipment of detonators.
It's a little odd.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.975
Well, he is a bomb-maker.

51:20.143 --> 51:23.340
No. What is odd is that it was shipped
to a bakery in Moscow.

51:23.513 --> 51:26.073
These detonators can also be used
for nuclear bombs.

51:26.249 --> 51:28.080
I think this is our connection to KAOS.

51:41.164 --> 51:42.688
I set that up.

51:53.510 --> 51:54.772
Let her go.

51:55.212 --> 51:56.611
No.

52:00.617 --> 52:04.109
I'm not totally incompetent
without a gun, you know.

52:28.845 --> 52:29.971
Thanks for the help.

52:31.014 --> 52:33.539
That's enough. Pity.

52:34.184 --> 52:38.382
I'm about to shoot beautiful woman
and her retard stable boy.

52:38.588 --> 52:39.612
And yet...

52:40.490 --> 52:42.685
...I will sleep like baby.

52:48.665 --> 52:51.190
- Not bad for a rookie.
- Not bad for an old lady.

53:01.878 --> 53:03.038
Siegfried here.

53:03.213 --> 53:05.340
<i>How could you possibly screw this up?</i>

53:05.515 --> 53:07.005
Krstic was a fool.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.913
- And they got lucky.
- <i>Who's that? Who's speaking?</i>

53:10.086 --> 53:11.212
That's no one, sir.

53:11.388 --> 53:14.186
<i>They're heading towards you.</i>
<i>Don't disappoint me again.</i>

53:14.357 --> 53:15.847
Don't worry, sir. They won't get pa...

53:17.594 --> 53:18.686
Why does he do that?

53:18.862 --> 53:20.727
Don't look at me. I'm no one.

53:20.897 --> 53:22.387
And don't you forget it.

53:22.699 --> 53:24.929
Everyone here can be replaced.

53:25.101 --> 53:26.762
I even have backup for you.

53:26.937 --> 53:28.928
It's called a rhinoceros.

53:54.764 --> 53:57.562
I think it's time to find new wheels.
Pull over.

54:03.607 --> 54:05.973
I feel good about the mission so far,
don't you?

54:06.142 --> 54:07.404
So far, sure.

54:07.577 --> 54:09.477
I think we work very well together.

54:09.646 --> 54:10.977
Like at the mansion.

54:11.147 --> 54:15.277
The way I held that guy's hair
while you punched him in the throat.

54:15.452 --> 54:17.317
That was nice.

54:17.988 --> 54:19.012
Nice?

54:19.189 --> 54:20.850
Yeah, well, good teamwork.

54:21.024 --> 54:22.491
What are you doing?

54:22.659 --> 54:25.184
I'm just saying that I think
we're very compatible.

54:25.362 --> 54:28.798
I think that you are confusing adrenaline
with, I don't know...

54:28.965 --> 54:30.523
...some other kind of hormone.

54:30.700 --> 54:33.100
- No. That's not...
- Know what, Max? Just stop it.

54:34.271 --> 54:37.001
Let me give you a lesson
that I had to learn the hard way.

54:37.173 --> 54:39.334
You can't trust anyone out here,
not even me.

54:39.509 --> 54:42.205
I mean, you know,
I could be a double agent.

54:42.779 --> 54:45.111
The break-in at CONTROL
was probably an inside job.

54:45.282 --> 54:48.342
It happened just as I got back.
How do you know that it wasn't me?

54:49.319 --> 54:51.879
- What are we talking about here?
- Let's just find a car.

54:52.055 --> 54:54.717
Which one's gonna attract
the least attention?

54:55.225 --> 54:58.820
All right, well, we have
a couple Soviet-era sedans here...

54:58.995 --> 55:02.396
...we have that tractor, that cart...

55:03.199 --> 55:05.394
...and... That'll work.

55:06.403 --> 55:09.270
- No.
- Yes.

55:09.439 --> 55:10.838
No.

55:11.174 --> 55:12.368
Yes.

55:16.012 --> 55:19.004
- Oh, yeah, we are really under the radar.
- Will you relax?

55:19.182 --> 55:22.049
Since the fall of Communism,
everybody has one of these here.

55:49.479 --> 55:51.242
There's our little KAOS bakery.

55:51.414 --> 55:54.542
I don't have to remind you,
but this isn't like the last place.

55:54.718 --> 55:58.245
There's no party, there's no dancing.
Everyone in there is a trained killer.

55:58.421 --> 56:00.286
Do you understand? Okay.

56:00.457 --> 56:02.925
Did they explain to you
how your belt buckle works?

56:03.093 --> 56:06.119
No, but the technology for holding
up pants hasn't changed much.

56:06.296 --> 56:08.264
- Max.
- Hey, what?

56:08.732 --> 56:11.530
This one has a compartment.
Inside there's a pill.

56:11.701 --> 56:14.761
If captured, it would cause death
in nine seconds.

56:14.938 --> 56:15.962
Great.

56:16.506 --> 56:19.475
But how exactly do I get them to take it?

56:21.611 --> 56:25.513
- Not much of a laugher, are you?
- Here. Put this on.

56:25.682 --> 56:27.081
- On what?
- On your molar.

56:27.250 --> 56:30.378
It's a tooth radio. It sends sound
up your jawbone, into your ear.

56:30.553 --> 56:34.717
I can't hear anything outside your mouth,
so if you get in trouble, you have to say so.

56:34.891 --> 56:35.880
Is it working?

56:39.362 --> 56:41.227
- Is it working?
- Yes.

56:41.398 --> 56:42.626
Good.

56:42.799 --> 56:43.823
Okay.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.696
Well, you know what to do.
Good luck in there.

56:46.870 --> 56:48.531
You too.

57:16.699 --> 57:18.530
Free <i>rugelach?</i>

57:18.701 --> 57:21.465
No, thank you.
I am here for something else.

57:21.805 --> 57:23.102
Bread?

57:23.273 --> 57:27.209
- Something hot.
- We have rolls that just came out.

57:27.377 --> 57:30.005
Even hotter. Much, much hotter.

57:30.346 --> 57:32.507
I already have boyfriend.

57:33.316 --> 57:35.910
- All right...
- Although, I could make exception.

57:36.085 --> 57:37.109
No, that's okay.

57:37.287 --> 57:40.484
Sure? Flour sacks in back,
very comfortable.

57:40.657 --> 57:44.149
I don't think we are on the same page.

57:44.494 --> 57:48.453
I'm here because Ladislas Krstic sent me.

57:48.631 --> 57:51.293
Ah. Take number.

57:52.602 --> 57:54.671
But I'm the only one here.

57:59.375 --> 58:01.002
Oh.

58:30.607 --> 58:31.904
Who are you?

58:32.075 --> 58:34.771
My name is Nudnik Shpilkes.
Who are you?

58:34.944 --> 58:37.538
- I am Siegfried.
- Did you say Siegfried?

58:38.882 --> 58:39.871
Max!

58:40.116 --> 58:41.140
Yes.

58:41.317 --> 58:43.217
I understand that you're
the man to see...

58:43.386 --> 58:46.446
...if someone is interested in acquiring
items of a nuclear nature.

58:46.623 --> 58:50.184
- How do I know you're not CONTROL?
- lf I were CONTROL, you'd already be dead.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.294
If you were CONTROL, you'd be dead.

58:52.462 --> 58:56.421
Well, neither of us is dead,
so I'm obviously not from CONTROL.

59:00.099 --> 59:02.090
That actually makes sense.

59:03.436 --> 59:06.496
Follow me, Mr. Shpilkes.

59:12.712 --> 59:14.737
Test. Test.

59:17.950 --> 59:20.748
Ah. The "Ode to Joy"
from Beethoven's Ninth.

59:20.920 --> 59:24.913
Stone deaf when he wrote it.
Syphilis. Fun stuff.

59:25.558 --> 59:30.086
Yes, a personal favorite.
A bit familiar, but it ends with a bang.

59:31.430 --> 59:32.920
You're doing great, Max.

59:33.132 --> 59:37.159
What I'm about to show you is
the inner sanctum of our entire operation.

59:37.336 --> 59:39.861
The inner sanctum
of the entire operation?

59:43.743 --> 59:44.801
Yes.

59:53.686 --> 59:55.153
This is it?

59:55.321 --> 59:56.754
Of course not. I lied.

59:56.923 --> 59:58.220
He does that.

59:58.391 --> 01:00:01.360
I'm going to kill you,
and then I'm going to kill your partner.

01:00:01.527 --> 01:00:03.290
I don't know who you're talking about.

01:00:08.501 --> 01:00:12.096
Ah. Mrs. Shpilkes must be lost.

01:00:12.271 --> 01:00:15.536
I think it's only fair to warn you,
this facility is surrounded...

01:00:15.708 --> 01:00:18.609
...by a highly trained team
of 130 Black Op snipers.

01:00:18.778 --> 01:00:20.746
- I don't believe you.
- Would you believe...

01:00:20.913 --> 01:00:22.904
...two dozen Delta Force commandos?

01:00:23.082 --> 01:00:25.607
- No.
- How about Chuck Norris with a BB gun?

01:00:26.185 --> 01:00:27.618
Goodbye, Mr. Smart.

01:00:30.289 --> 01:00:33.986
Well, Mr. Shtarker,
I think you've underestimated me...

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.151
...and the element of surpr...!

01:00:46.238 --> 01:00:48.968
99, we've been compromised. Get out.

01:01:08.861 --> 01:01:10.556
<i>Access denied.</i>

01:01:40.393 --> 01:01:42.918
<i>Access denied. Access denied.</i>

01:01:43.095 --> 01:01:45.563
<i>Access denied.</i>

01:01:58.611 --> 01:01:59.635
Max, where are you?

01:01:59.812 --> 01:02:02.042
99, I found the yellowcake.

01:02:02.214 --> 01:02:03.875
Of course you did, it's a bakery.

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:06.712
No, not yellow "cake" cake,
yellowcake uranium.

01:02:06.886 --> 01:02:11.380
Although there is yellow "cake" cake
here as well.

01:02:12.224 --> 01:02:13.486
Oh, Max.

01:02:40.301 --> 01:02:41.928
Max, do you read...?

01:02:42.103 --> 01:02:43.365
99!

01:02:43.538 --> 01:02:45.369
What happened to your radio?

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.532
I swallowed it. I can get it back,
but you may not want it.

01:02:48.709 --> 01:02:50.533
- Good Lord.
- Listen...

01:02:50.711 --> 01:02:53.242
...l've placed charges
at points all over the building.

01:02:54.635 --> 01:02:58.332
What? Max, you can't blow up a building
full of radioactive material!

01:02:58.506 --> 01:03:02.408
I know that, 99. I've placed only enough
charges to safely bury the weapons lab.

01:03:03.444 --> 01:03:04.638
Max, that's brilliant.

01:03:04.812 --> 01:03:08.612
Wow. That's maybe the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

01:03:37.011 --> 01:03:40.947
- I don't get it, I thought he was dead!
- I will say this, he is not a quitter.

01:03:57.431 --> 01:03:59.956
This is just ridiculous!

01:04:06.173 --> 01:04:07.197
99!

01:04:07.374 --> 01:04:08.500
Wake up, 99.

01:04:08.676 --> 01:04:10.837
Maybe you should kiss him again.

01:04:13.781 --> 01:04:17.080
Wait, I know that voice.
The chatter! Dalip.

01:04:24.859 --> 01:04:26.053
Ow! That was me!

01:04:29.964 --> 01:04:31.988
- Max?
- I'm... Yep, still fighting.

01:04:51.085 --> 01:04:55.545
Now, Dalip, I can prove that I know you.
Your favorite dish is chicken tikka!

01:04:56.323 --> 01:04:59.349
Like me, you enjoy
<i>American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest.</i>

01:05:13.574 --> 01:05:15.304
Ow.

01:05:25.052 --> 01:05:28.215
Wait, wait, Dalip,
there's something else that I know.

01:05:28.389 --> 01:05:29.549
Max. Max.

01:05:29.723 --> 01:05:33.454
Your marriage is in trouble.
Your darling wife, Zeenat, is leaving you.

01:05:34.061 --> 01:05:36.256
But there is still hope.

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:37.897
Do you love her?

01:05:43.137 --> 01:05:46.971
- Wha...?
- Then show her. Go home for lunch.

01:05:47.141 --> 01:05:49.701
Take her with you the next time
you go to kill someone.

01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:51.702
She just wants to be with you...

01:05:51.879 --> 01:05:54.143
...and that means
less time with her sister...

01:05:54.315 --> 01:05:57.011
...who we both know is undermining
your relationship.

01:05:57.851 --> 01:06:00.285
Kick the gun to me.

01:06:00.454 --> 01:06:02.012
99, please.

01:06:02.756 --> 01:06:04.314
Big people feel pain too.

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:17.801
What are you doing?

01:06:18.606 --> 01:06:21.006
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:06:21.175 --> 01:06:22.802
Max!

01:06:25.179 --> 01:06:29.809
Okay. Okay. That's all right. That's okay.

01:06:31.919 --> 01:06:35.082
Her sister's such a bitch.

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:44.928
- You all right?
- Yeah. That was amazing.

01:06:46.233 --> 01:06:47.598
Thank you.

01:06:49.703 --> 01:06:51.227
We gotta go.

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:00.804
99.

01:07:07.655 --> 01:07:10.351
- What was that?
- I cramped up.

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:14.350
Come on. Come here.

01:07:14.728 --> 01:07:16.389
Good idea.

01:07:16.563 --> 01:07:20.294
We will climb up with you,
and we'll all go... together.

01:07:30.277 --> 01:07:31.608
He left us here.

01:07:31.945 --> 01:07:33.572
What a douche.

01:07:51.298 --> 01:07:54.199
Missed it by that much.

01:07:58.005 --> 01:08:00.940
Well, that's convenient. Shoot them.

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:11.748
Whatever you do, 99, don't look down!

01:08:11.919 --> 01:08:15.548
I'm gonna try to get us over to that ledge!
We can do this, 99!

01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:17.948
Max.

01:08:18.591 --> 01:08:19.616
Right.

01:08:24.465 --> 01:08:25.693
Thanks, Chief.

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:27.823
Okay, no problem.

01:08:28.001 --> 01:08:30.834
The Chief is thrilled.
He sent 23 out to observe the cleanup.

01:08:31.004 --> 01:08:32.028
Great.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:37.506
Listen, is it possible that you could
answer a personal question?

01:08:37.678 --> 01:08:39.509
It's possible.

01:08:40.346 --> 01:08:42.439
Why did you change your looks?

01:08:43.584 --> 01:08:47.212
Oh. Um...
That's not really a personal question.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.013
Things from my non-work sphere
spilled into my work sphere.

01:08:51.191 --> 01:08:55.127
Facts became known, identities were
compromised, and I became a brunette.

01:08:55.295 --> 01:08:58.354
Wow. That is a great story...

01:08:58.532 --> 01:09:01.933
...in which you revealed
absolutely nothing about yourself.

01:09:07.374 --> 01:09:09.001
I blew a mission.

01:09:10.778 --> 01:09:15.442
I was involved with someone from work.
I lost focus. The mission blew up.

01:09:15.616 --> 01:09:20.076
I broke it off with that person,
but my identity had already been revealed.

01:09:20.254 --> 01:09:21.812
So I had two choices.

01:09:21.988 --> 01:09:24.685
I could either spend the rest of my life
behind a desk...

01:09:25.559 --> 01:09:27.527
...which would be like
eight hours a day...

01:09:27.694 --> 01:09:30.390
...of scraping a cheese grater
against my forehead.

01:09:30.564 --> 01:09:32.395
- Oh, you know.
- Yes.

01:09:32.566 --> 01:09:35.194
Or I could change my face,
so that's what I did.

01:09:38.037 --> 01:09:42.702
And it was painful,
but it needed to be done, and s...

01:09:47.147 --> 01:09:50.446
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
- Okay.

01:09:53.921 --> 01:09:56.185
I used to look like my mom.

01:10:01.562 --> 01:10:04.554
I used to look like
two of my moms put together.

01:10:42.803 --> 01:10:45.636
Sir, if I may ask...

01:10:45.806 --> 01:10:47.967
...how did you choose the target?

01:10:48.141 --> 01:10:50.507
- Why Los Angeles?
- Major city...

01:10:50.677 --> 01:10:52.542
...lots of media attention...

01:10:52.946 --> 01:10:54.607
...and the president will be there.

01:10:55.115 --> 01:10:58.380
Still, it's too bad
about all the dead movie stars.

01:10:58.552 --> 01:10:59.849
Yes.

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:04.389
What will we do without
their razor-sharp political advice?

01:11:08.896 --> 01:11:11.990
Oh, my God, have you eaten the crew?

01:11:12.499 --> 01:11:15.059
Oh, look, it understands.

01:11:15.235 --> 01:11:16.896
Get back to work.

01:11:33.153 --> 01:11:37.317
No, that's not possible.
No, no, no. Max said that...

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:40.920
No.

01:11:44.665 --> 01:11:46.599
That doesn't make any sense.

01:11:48.368 --> 01:11:51.303
Yellowcake uranium, warheads,
an entire production line.

01:11:51.471 --> 01:11:54.440
There's nothing here
but what used to be a bakery.

01:11:54.608 --> 01:11:57.168
There are no weapons?
No radioactivity of any kind?

01:11:57.344 --> 01:12:00.108
Nothing. I've swept the entire area,
and it's clean.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.477
- But Max said that he s...
- Did you see the evidence yourself?

01:12:03.984 --> 01:12:05.315
No.

01:12:05.719 --> 01:12:08.517
No, every time he found something,
he was alone.

01:12:14.728 --> 01:12:16.525
What do you want me to do with Max?

01:12:16.697 --> 01:12:18.187
- Do with Max?
- Max?

01:12:20.801 --> 01:12:23.292
You were right when you said
I shouldn't trust you.

01:12:25.138 --> 01:12:26.332
Give me the phone.

01:12:30.644 --> 01:12:33.112
And who might this be? Siegfried?

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.440
<i>Hello, Max.</i>

01:12:34.614 --> 01:12:35.638
Chief?

01:12:38.085 --> 01:12:39.848
Knockout gas, 99?

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:43.387
Please. I have trained my body
to be impervious to...

01:12:43.557 --> 01:12:44.888
That's new stuff.

01:12:47.828 --> 01:12:49.352
Oh, Max.

01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:58.795
I'm very disappointed, Max.

01:12:58.972 --> 01:13:01.873
I thought you and I were supposedly
cut from the same cloth.

01:13:02.042 --> 01:13:04.237
How can you think
that I am a double agent?

01:13:04.411 --> 01:13:06.879
You lied about finding evidence
of radioactivity.

01:13:07.047 --> 01:13:09.345
Killed Krstic before
anybody could question him.

01:13:09.516 --> 01:13:12.713
There's a matter of your
stoving my head in with a fire extinguisher.

01:13:12.886 --> 01:13:17.187
I said I was sorry. You just didn't hear me,
because you were in a mini coma.

01:13:17.357 --> 01:13:19.052
You've made CONTROL a laughingstock.

01:13:19.226 --> 01:13:22.024
The vice president wants to shut us down,
you know.

01:13:24.798 --> 01:13:25.822
99.

01:13:26.533 --> 01:13:28.125
This whole week...

01:13:28.769 --> 01:13:30.031
...last night...

01:13:30.971 --> 01:13:32.165
...you know me.

01:13:32.339 --> 01:13:33.772
Apparently not.

01:13:34.574 --> 01:13:35.768
Oh, my God!

01:13:35.942 --> 01:13:38.035
You two? You and Max?

01:13:38.211 --> 01:13:40.907
You said we had to break up
because we work together.

01:13:41.081 --> 01:13:42.275
Oh, my God! You and 23?

01:13:42.883 --> 01:13:45.351
I am so sexually threatened right now.

01:13:50.824 --> 01:13:52.314
<i>You have reached...</i>

01:13:52.492 --> 01:13:54.357
<i>... the United States</i>
<i>Department of Homeland Security.</i>

01:13:54.528 --> 01:13:56.996
<i>For threats against</i>
<i>the continental United States, press 1.</i>

01:13:57.164 --> 01:13:59.928
<i>For threats against Hawaii, press 2.</i>
<i>For threats against Puerto Rico...</i>

01:14:01.601 --> 01:14:05.037
You know, you're the only human being
I know who snores when he's awake?

01:14:05.205 --> 01:14:06.832
<i>If you're calling from a rotary...</i>

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:09.601
Okay, today's threat assessment.

01:14:09.776 --> 01:14:14.270
- There are 72 threats on the list. Mike?
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

01:14:14.448 --> 01:14:17.713
Okay, we have a deteriorating situation
in Venezuela.

01:14:17.884 --> 01:14:20.444
We have a deteriorating situation
in Afghanistan.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:23.316
What about the deteriorating situation
in North Korea?

01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:25.355
- I was getting to that.
- When? Next week?

01:14:25.525 --> 01:14:27.857
Yes, next Tuesday,
right after I kick your ass.

01:14:28.028 --> 01:14:32.260
Gentlemen, when we argue,
the terrorists win.

01:14:35.735 --> 01:14:38.499
Anyway, last night at a private dinner...

01:14:38.672 --> 01:14:42.369
...President Kim Jong-il
made a very odd threat to, and I quote:

01:14:42.542 --> 01:14:45.136
"Make a pudding from the bones
of Americans."

01:14:45.312 --> 01:14:47.143
That guy's insane.

01:14:47.314 --> 01:14:51.341
Doesn't he know bones are crunchy?
Who'd want a crunchy pudding?

01:14:53.386 --> 01:14:54.410
War room.

01:14:54.588 --> 01:14:58.581
Finally. My name is Siegfried,
and I represent KAOS.

01:14:58.758 --> 01:15:02.956
<i>Over the past few months, we have</i>
<i>assembled a stockpile of nuclear weapons...</i>

01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:08.033
<i>... which we have distributed</i>
<i>to 20 unfriendly, unstable dictators.</i>

01:15:08.802 --> 01:15:12.067
For the moment, KAOS retains
the bomb activation codes...

01:15:12.239 --> 01:15:16.141
...but we will release the codes
unless our demands are met.

01:15:16.309 --> 01:15:17.367
What are your demands?

01:15:17.544 --> 01:15:19.603
200 billion dollars by 3 p.m.

01:15:19.779 --> 01:15:22.304
200 billion dollars by 3 p. m?

01:15:22.482 --> 01:15:23.881
<i>You seem a bit slow.</i>

01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:27.247
- Is there someone else I can talk to?
- Good one.

01:15:27.821 --> 01:15:30.551
Look, Siegfried,
we don't negotiate with terrorists...

01:15:30.724 --> 01:15:33.056
...and you're obviously bluffing.
Take a hike.

01:15:33.226 --> 01:15:34.853
What? Are you kidding me?

01:15:35.028 --> 01:15:38.657
You spent the morning talking about
pudding, and you ignore a credible threat?

01:15:38.832 --> 01:15:41.300
Credible? Come on.
KAOS has been defunct for 20 years.

01:15:41.468 --> 01:15:43.993
With all due respect,
the CIA knows nothing about KAOS.

01:15:44.171 --> 01:15:46.605
CONTROL has to be in charge here.

01:15:46.773 --> 01:15:49.765
- Like when you bombed that bakery?
- Muffins of mass destruction.

01:15:51.645 --> 01:15:53.806
That's it!
I've been waiting for this since Nixon.

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:57.211
- Here we go.
- I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!

01:15:57.384 --> 01:15:59.443
- Okay!
- Okay! Come on!

01:16:02.756 --> 01:16:05.350
It seems like they don't believe you.

01:16:05.926 --> 01:16:10.260
Which is why we've arranged
for a little demonstration.

01:16:58.245 --> 01:17:00.042
Chief, you wanted to see me?

01:17:00.213 --> 01:17:03.614
Yes. You and 23 are coming with me
to see the president.

01:17:03.783 --> 01:17:06.513
- Can't you call him?
- Vice president won't let me through.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.753
I can't believe we have to go
all the way to Los Angeles.

01:17:09.923 --> 01:17:11.754
Why is the president never here?

01:17:11.925 --> 01:17:14.485
I'm sure whatever he's doing
is vital to the nation.

01:17:14.861 --> 01:17:16.726
"Good night, moon.

01:17:17.497 --> 01:17:20.432
Good night,
cow jumping over the moon."

01:17:21.434 --> 01:17:24.733
Actually, I think you would suck
as my teacher.

01:17:24.904 --> 01:17:27.395
Well, from wh...

01:17:28.341 --> 01:17:31.071
Hey, Smart. Happy birthday.

01:17:38.318 --> 01:17:40.081
I'm fat!

01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:51.463
Gentlemen.

01:17:53.733 --> 01:17:56.531
Oh. Good, the itchy kind.

01:17:56.703 --> 01:17:57.795
My favorite.

01:17:57.971 --> 01:17:59.768
Does this one also have smallpox?

01:18:02.942 --> 01:18:05.069
And that was a human tooth.

01:18:05.245 --> 01:18:08.942
<i>American Top 40.</i>
<i>- With Ryan Seacrest.</i>

01:18:09.115 --> 01:18:11.948
<i>Here's a sweet dedication</i>
<i>from a little lady named Dalip.</i>

01:18:12.118 --> 01:18:13.585
<i>It's to her boyfriend, Max.</i>

01:18:13.753 --> 01:18:18.281
<i>"Meet me in L.A.</i>
<i>Things will be very hot. Nuclear hot. "</i>

01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:21.825
<i>I don't know, if I were Max,</i>
<i>I would get myself to L.A.</i>

01:18:31.638 --> 01:18:34.004
Hey! Dumb guards!

01:18:34.174 --> 01:18:38.406
Why don't you come in here so I can
make you my pretty little girlfriends.

01:18:38.578 --> 01:18:40.045
You'll have to shower for weeks!

01:18:42.282 --> 01:18:44.045
But you will never get the smell off...

01:18:44.217 --> 01:18:46.447
You two seem very angry.

01:18:48.188 --> 01:18:50.315
Thank you, sir, may I have another?

01:18:52.625 --> 01:18:54.216
I was kidding.

01:19:02.335 --> 01:19:05.930
9-4-3-6-8.

01:19:09.542 --> 01:19:12.477
9-4-3-6-8.

01:19:29.529 --> 01:19:31.292
Turn around slowly.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.799
Guys, you have to believe me.
I am not a double agent.

01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:39.461
- We never thought you were.
- Yeah, we love you, man.

01:19:39.639 --> 01:19:42.403
Then what's with the firearm
and the freak-show expressions?

01:19:42.575 --> 01:19:43.974
For the security cameras.

01:19:44.144 --> 01:19:47.409
If it looks like we let you go,
we'd totally get fired.

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:48.638
Got it.

01:19:51.284 --> 01:19:52.751
So where are the Chief and 99?

01:19:52.919 --> 01:19:54.887
They flew to L.A.
to talk to the president.

01:19:55.054 --> 01:19:57.454
I need to get out of here
before someone stops me.

01:19:57.624 --> 01:19:59.216
- Overpower us.
- Good idea.

01:19:59.392 --> 01:20:01.053
Bruce, I will smash you in the face.

01:20:01.227 --> 01:20:03.821
- Thank you.
- Lloyd, I'll simulate your disembowelment.

01:20:03.997 --> 01:20:05.521
Ready? One...

01:20:05.698 --> 01:20:08.098
Not yet! I haven't punched yet.
React when I punch.

01:20:08.268 --> 01:20:09.633
- Oh, yeah.
- One...

01:20:09.803 --> 01:20:11.566
...two, three.

01:20:13.006 --> 01:20:14.633
- Wrong way.
- Okay, wait.

01:20:14.808 --> 01:20:17.276
- Sometimes I faint.
- I'm not going to hit you.

01:20:17.444 --> 01:20:21.039
No, but when I see blood, or when
I talk about blood, or think about blood...

01:20:21.214 --> 01:20:23.876
There will be no blood.
Hang in there. Hang in, buddy.

01:21:11.197 --> 01:21:12.858
What are you doing, dummkopf?

01:21:13.032 --> 01:21:16.798
Running out in the middle of the road!
You could get hit by a car!

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:19.795
Well, that was ironic.

01:21:34.087 --> 01:21:35.577
Chief, I'm not buying it.

01:21:35.755 --> 01:21:38.747
With all our satellites,
there's no way anybody could possibly...

01:21:38.925 --> 01:21:41.189
...have nuclear bombs
that we wouldn't know about.

01:21:41.361 --> 01:21:42.760
"Nuclear!"

01:21:43.162 --> 01:21:44.720
- What's that?
- Sorry.

01:21:44.898 --> 01:21:48.231
Mr. President, if I could just
please show you some data, you'd agree...

01:21:48.401 --> 01:21:49.925
Well, just back up here a second.

01:21:50.103 --> 01:21:52.094
First thing I'd like to know is...

01:21:52.272 --> 01:21:54.433
...what did the vice president
say about this?

01:21:54.607 --> 01:21:58.338
I'm afraid the vice president and I had
a less-than-cordial encounter yesterday.

01:21:58.511 --> 01:22:00.274
- Less-than-cordial, you say?
- Yes, sir.

01:22:00.446 --> 01:22:01.470
I'll say.

01:22:02.849 --> 01:22:05.545
The chairman of joint chiefs
sent me this little movie.

01:22:05.718 --> 01:22:07.379
Put it right here on my cell phone.

01:22:07.554 --> 01:22:09.545
Let me share this with you.
This is my favorite part.

01:22:09.722 --> 01:22:12.213
<i>I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!</i>

01:22:14.093 --> 01:22:15.287
Oh, Chief.

01:22:15.461 --> 01:22:16.621
Very sweet tackle.

01:22:16.796 --> 01:22:19.287
Look. Look at the surprise on his face.

01:22:19.465 --> 01:22:21.797
I probably owe you an apology
for that, sir.

01:22:21.968 --> 01:22:23.560
No. Please, just save your breath.

01:22:23.736 --> 01:22:26.000
But I have to agree
with that son of a bitch.

01:22:26.172 --> 01:22:28.504
We cannot respond to every threat.

01:22:29.876 --> 01:22:31.309
Case closed.

01:22:54.901 --> 01:22:55.925
Max?

01:22:56.102 --> 01:22:57.228
<i>Hello, 99.</i>

01:22:57.403 --> 01:22:59.234
Trace 99's call, now!

01:22:59.405 --> 01:23:01.270
- Where are you?
- <i>That's not important.</i>

01:23:01.441 --> 01:23:05.343
<i>What is important is that KAOS has planted</i>
<i>a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles.</i>

01:23:05.511 --> 01:23:07.479
We got him. He's still in Washington.

01:23:07.647 --> 01:23:10.912
<i>Listen, while I was in my cell,</i>
<i>I had some time to think.</i>

01:23:13.052 --> 01:23:18.115
<i>I realized that even though I was accused</i>
<i>of something I didn't do, I was happy.</i>

01:23:18.558 --> 01:23:23.427
<i>Because at least for a little while,</i>
<i>I got to live my dream of being an agent.</i>

01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:26.193
<i>And I got to be with you.</i>

01:23:26.366 --> 01:23:29.199
<i>I learned that you have</i>
<i>a mean right cross...</i>

01:23:29.369 --> 01:23:32.566
<i>... you are almost as good</i>
<i>a dancer as me...</i>

01:23:32.739 --> 01:23:35.970
- <i>... and you used to look like your mom.</i>
- Max.

01:23:36.142 --> 01:23:39.475
<i>Please, 99. All I'm asking is for you</i>
<i>to look me in the eyes...</i>

01:23:39.646 --> 01:23:42.240
<i>... and tell me that</i>
<i>you don't feel something too.</i>

01:23:43.016 --> 01:23:44.176
Freeze!

01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:48.116
Oh, Max. How could I look in your eyes?

01:23:49.489 --> 01:23:50.751
Just turn around.

01:23:58.164 --> 01:24:00.155
Why are you talking into your shoe?

01:24:00.333 --> 01:24:03.734
The old "call forwarding
from the shoe phone to the cell phone...

01:24:03.903 --> 01:24:07.236
...so you don't know where I am,
then I appear on the roof behind you...

01:24:07.407 --> 01:24:09.398
...and surprise everyone" trick.

01:24:09.575 --> 01:24:11.440
- Don't move.
- What are you doing?

01:24:11.611 --> 01:24:12.635
How did you get here?

01:24:15.815 --> 01:24:17.908
Do you have another one of these?

01:24:21.721 --> 01:24:22.745
It doesn't matter.

01:24:22.922 --> 01:24:25.891
What matters is that there is a bomb,
and I'm here to find it.

01:24:26.059 --> 01:24:28.220
- How do you know this?
- I'd rather not say.

01:24:28.394 --> 01:24:30.385
Max, there are millions of lives at stake.

01:24:30.563 --> 01:24:33.760
If you have credible information
from a reliable source...

01:24:33.933 --> 01:24:36.128
...I wanna know it,
and I wanna know it now.

01:24:37.203 --> 01:24:40.070
I heard it from America's sweetheart,
Ryan Seacrest.

01:24:40.239 --> 01:24:41.570
- Whoa.
- Come on.

01:24:41.741 --> 01:24:43.333
It was a coded message.

01:24:43.509 --> 01:24:46.876
Max, we're running out of time here.
What are you talking about?

01:24:47.046 --> 01:24:50.880
I received a tip from a KAOS agent
who I befriended at the bakery.

01:24:56.389 --> 01:24:58.152
I think we should trust him, Chief.

01:24:58.324 --> 01:25:00.292
Absolutely, Chief.
I'm with 99 on that one.

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:03.258
Every time I look at Max's puppy eyes,
I'm a goner.

01:25:03.429 --> 01:25:07.229
Oh, my God. You've really never
had anyone break up with you, have you?

01:25:08.801 --> 01:25:11.702
Chief, you said that you and I are alike.

01:25:11.871 --> 01:25:14.237
That we are both old-fashioned men.

01:25:14.907 --> 01:25:17.034
Well, I have an old-fashioned hunch.

01:25:17.210 --> 01:25:21.772
I have a hunch that you have a hunch
that I am telling the truth.

01:25:22.882 --> 01:25:23.974
Max...

01:25:25.418 --> 01:25:28.649
Any double agent who escapes
from a high-security holding situation...

01:25:28.821 --> 01:25:32.416
...only to fall into the arms of
the people that got him in the first place...

01:25:32.592 --> 01:25:36.392
...is either an idiot or not a double agent,
and I don't think you're an idiot.

01:25:37.163 --> 01:25:38.187
Thank you, Chief.

01:25:38.831 --> 01:25:42.164
Now, we know that the president
is in town.

01:25:42.335 --> 01:25:46.135
- But what exactly is he doing here today?
- Max.

01:25:46.305 --> 01:25:50.605
- Yes. We need to find out his itinerary.
- But, Max, the...

01:25:50.777 --> 01:25:53.507
I know, 99. I need to go get a paper.

01:26:02.889 --> 01:26:04.413
We're in position. More or less.

01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:07.525
Roger. I have the whole
security system online. Just remember...

01:26:07.693 --> 01:26:11.459
Yes, we know.
How about a little radio silence?

01:26:11.631 --> 01:26:15.630
I wanna quit, but what can I do?
He's married to my sister.

01:26:15.802 --> 01:26:20.262
By the way, I reviewed the security tapes
from the explosion at the bakery...

01:26:20.439 --> 01:26:24.466
...and I know that you let those
CONTROL agents get away.

01:26:24.644 --> 01:26:26.908
So unless you do your job today...

01:26:27.079 --> 01:26:33.211
...your lovely wife, Zeenat,
will have eaten her last kebab.

01:26:54.907 --> 01:26:58.809
<i>Blue team, check for access violation</i>
<i>at quadrant three, sector seven.</i>

01:26:58.978 --> 01:27:00.002
Copy that.

01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:02.540
Go.

01:27:20.032 --> 01:27:21.727
That's it. You're there.

01:27:53.499 --> 01:27:55.228
Door secure.

01:28:27.767 --> 01:28:30.031
We need to get everyone out
and shut this place.

01:28:30.202 --> 01:28:31.669
We've swept the building.

01:28:31.837 --> 01:28:35.603
The Secret Service doesn't make mistakes
like the fabulous bakery boys.

01:28:35.775 --> 01:28:37.709
Who told you about that? Who told you?

01:28:37.877 --> 01:28:40.141
Take it easy.
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

01:28:40.313 --> 01:28:42.941
And this day will not include
me blowing into your mouth.

01:28:43.115 --> 01:28:46.107
- You want a piece of me?
- Come on, Chief! he's not worth it.

01:28:46.285 --> 01:28:47.912
- Hey.
- I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

01:28:48.087 --> 01:28:49.111
You better watch it.

01:28:49.288 --> 01:28:50.778
Let me at him!

01:29:00.199 --> 01:29:02.099
<i>From Los Angeles, California...</i>

01:29:02.268 --> 01:29:04.125
<i>... we welcome you to a live broadcast...</i>

01:29:04.303 --> 01:29:06.294
<i>... of our concert for the president.</i>

01:29:06.472 --> 01:29:08.940
<i>Dignitaries from around the world</i>
<i>have gathered.</i>

01:29:09.108 --> 01:29:13.545
<i>We will be broadcasting from the Walt</i>
<i>Disney Concert Hall throughout the evening.</i>

01:29:13.713 --> 01:29:16.147
There has got to be another way in.

01:29:16.315 --> 01:29:19.216
Why are we even still here?
There are 50 other perfect targets.

01:29:19.385 --> 01:29:22.786
The Golden Gate Bridge, Space Needle.
There's no chatter to support this.

01:29:22.955 --> 01:29:25.753
And you know what,
I'm done with this. Stop!

01:29:25.925 --> 01:29:29.383
Wait a minute, 23.
You're radioactive hot.

01:29:29.562 --> 01:29:31.621
When were you exposed to radioactivity?

01:29:31.797 --> 01:29:35.096
I just got back from Russia.
Half the people there are radioactive.

01:29:35.267 --> 01:29:36.291
The bakery.

01:29:36.469 --> 01:29:39.097
You said you swept the area
and everything was clean.

01:29:39.271 --> 01:29:41.671
- I did, and it was.
- Really?

01:29:41.841 --> 01:29:44.435
Was there anyone else there,
or do we just trust you?

01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:45.934
23.

01:29:47.113 --> 01:29:48.808
Your knife wound is seeping.

01:29:49.415 --> 01:29:51.246
Sudden rise in blood pressure?

01:29:51.417 --> 01:29:54.750
Perhaps you're nervous because
there is a bomb here and you know it.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:58.378
And what is with the briefcase?
Could that actually be the football?

01:29:58.557 --> 01:30:01.549
You mean the computer
containing the bomb activation codes?

01:30:01.727 --> 01:30:05.595
Exactly. I have no interest in a real football
unless it is signed by Joe Montana...

01:30:05.765 --> 01:30:07.960
...and I don't believe that's the case.

01:30:09.702 --> 01:30:11.465
Well, 23?

01:30:12.271 --> 01:30:14.296
You know what? We're out of time.

01:30:15.808 --> 01:30:17.867
You follow us, she dies.

01:30:27.686 --> 01:30:29.381
Stop this car!

01:30:29.789 --> 01:30:33.190
Max! You idiot!
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:30:33.359 --> 01:30:36.692
You don't just slap your hands
on a government vehicle!

01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:42.599
All right, that's it! When we get back
to Washington, you morons are through!

01:30:45.738 --> 01:30:49.196
Damn it. How have you gotten
away with this for so long?

01:30:49.375 --> 01:30:51.741
I can't believe none of us saw it,
especially me.

01:30:51.911 --> 01:30:54.311
Don't beat yourself up.
You'll be dead soon anyway.

01:30:56.849 --> 01:30:58.908
Chief, he's heading
southbound on Grand.

01:30:59.085 --> 01:31:00.677
Thanks, Bruce. Keep us posted.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:04.949
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>CONTROL assholes who just stole my vehicle!</i>

01:31:05.124 --> 01:31:09.561
<i>I know you're listening! You two dickwads</i>
<i>put one scratch on that car...</i>

01:31:10.763 --> 01:31:12.128
<i>What was that?</i>

01:31:12.298 --> 01:31:14.061
Sorry, I'm losing you.

01:31:14.834 --> 01:31:15.858
What the?

01:31:17.336 --> 01:31:19.827
All right, fellas.
20 dollars if you hit the car.

01:31:21.841 --> 01:31:25.675
Chief, I have to say,
this whole thing really steams my clams.

01:31:25.845 --> 01:31:28.541
I cannot get over the fact
that 23 is a traitor.

01:31:28.714 --> 01:31:30.113
Sand trap!

01:31:30.282 --> 01:31:33.115
Now I know how you felt
when you thought I was a traitor.

01:31:33.285 --> 01:31:34.547
Tractor!

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.587
I don't know how I missed it.
I'm usually very observant.

01:31:37.756 --> 01:31:39.087
Swordfish!

01:31:46.265 --> 01:31:48.665
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I don't know.

01:31:48.834 --> 01:31:52.702
Were you thinking, "Holy shit, holy shit,
a swordfish almost went through my head?"

01:31:52.872 --> 01:31:54.396
If so, yes.

01:31:54.573 --> 01:31:55.870
Come on.

01:32:18.397 --> 01:32:21.958
On behalf of the United States Government,
I hereby commandeer this plane.

01:32:22.868 --> 01:32:24.768
The device is armed.
I hope you're moving.

01:32:24.937 --> 01:32:27.906
Don't worry, sir. I'll be well clear.

01:32:32.378 --> 01:32:34.312
<i>Chief, they're headed</i>
<i>southbound on l-47.</i>

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.311
Thanks, Bruce. I got them!

01:32:37.183 --> 01:32:38.912
I need to get down to that car!

01:32:39.084 --> 01:32:42.576
No, no good. If I get too low,
he'll hear me coming!

01:32:46.392 --> 01:32:48.360
I have another idea.

01:32:49.195 --> 01:32:50.856
What are you doing?

01:32:53.365 --> 01:32:56.061
Get back in the plane!
You're gonna kill yourself!

01:32:57.369 --> 01:32:58.666
Hang on!

01:33:15.187 --> 01:33:16.779
Hang on! We're going in!

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.686
Sorry, Max.

01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.962
Tuesday's not gonna work.
Cannot do Tuesday, I'm already...

01:33:31.136 --> 01:33:33.104
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Sean! Sean! Sean!

01:33:33.272 --> 01:33:35.297
See how annoying that is?

01:33:55.628 --> 01:33:59.519
See, this is your problem.
Some men like women more feminine!

01:33:59.698 --> 01:34:01.165
- I'm not feminine?
- No.

01:34:01.333 --> 01:34:02.459
I'm not feminine?

01:34:13.379 --> 01:34:14.937
Freeze!

01:34:15.214 --> 01:34:16.909
That was so cool.

01:34:17.816 --> 01:34:19.147
Max!

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:28.684
Damn it to hell.

01:34:38.504 --> 01:34:40.631
You know, I might be more help
if you untie me!

01:34:40.906 --> 01:34:43.272
There's a knife in my right front pocket!

01:34:49.748 --> 01:34:50.976
Stop it! Stop it!

01:34:51.450 --> 01:34:52.474
What?

01:34:53.719 --> 01:34:56.313
That's not my knife! That's not my...

01:34:56.855 --> 01:34:58.152
I got it!

01:35:04.863 --> 01:35:06.524
No, 99, don't touch that!

01:35:09.868 --> 01:35:11.358
Oh, my Lord.

01:35:33.058 --> 01:35:35.151
Yeah! The kid's still got it.

01:35:40.966 --> 01:35:41.990
Max, hurry!

01:35:44.069 --> 01:35:45.832
Hold on, 99!

01:35:51.877 --> 01:35:55.745
Chief, we can't stop the car! We have
the football, but we do not know the code!

01:35:55.914 --> 01:35:57.381
We need to figure out something!

01:35:57.549 --> 01:36:00.382
These tracks are taking us back downtown,
towards the bomb!

01:36:04.823 --> 01:36:07.690
We gotta get you out of there,
and you won't survive the jump!

01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:08.884
I'm coming to get you!

01:36:33.919 --> 01:36:35.978
- Oh, God!
- Hold on, 99!

01:36:37.456 --> 01:36:40.254
It's not over, Max!
I'll take that briefcase!

01:36:40.426 --> 01:36:42.485
If you want it, you'll have to take it!

01:36:42.928 --> 01:36:46.455
- That's what I just said!
- I know, I'm just trying to annoy you!

01:37:35.214 --> 01:37:37.114
Unusual but effective.

01:37:44.890 --> 01:37:46.790
- You all right?
- I'm fine!

01:37:53.098 --> 01:37:54.531
Max!

01:37:55.267 --> 01:37:56.291
Max, your foot!

01:38:02.241 --> 01:38:05.210
- I wish we had more time!
- What?

01:38:25.564 --> 01:38:28.727
- Max!
- No!

01:38:49.588 --> 01:38:51.055
Oh, Max.

01:38:57.129 --> 01:38:58.619
No. No!

01:39:04.269 --> 01:39:06.737
I wish we had more time too.

01:39:09.441 --> 01:39:11.238
So you did hear me?

01:39:14.046 --> 01:39:15.070
Max?

01:39:19.251 --> 01:39:21.082
But the train...

01:39:22.087 --> 01:39:24.282
Missed it by that much.

01:39:43.609 --> 01:39:45.509
"Operation Joy"?

01:39:47.012 --> 01:39:50.846
The "Ode to Joy" will end with a bang.

01:39:55.921 --> 01:39:59.084
- Chief!
- Yeah, Maxie! Are you okay?

01:39:59.257 --> 01:40:03.318
Listen, I think the final notes
of the "Ode to Joy" trigger the bomb!

01:40:03.495 --> 01:40:05.292
We have to stop the concert!

01:40:05.464 --> 01:40:06.761
I'm on it.

01:40:43.268 --> 01:40:46.829
My buttocks are really stinging
from being dragged.

01:40:56.081 --> 01:40:58.515
Hey, grandpa, I already told you...

01:40:59.251 --> 01:41:02.448
Speak up, son.
I'm an old man, you know.

01:41:13.699 --> 01:41:15.963
I like that tackling part.

01:41:20.272 --> 01:41:23.036
I am so, so sorry about that.

01:41:23.208 --> 01:41:25.005
Wait! No, no, let him go.

01:41:25.977 --> 01:41:28.070
- There is a bomb.
- Where?

01:41:28.246 --> 01:41:31.238
Would you believe in the piano?

01:41:36.555 --> 01:41:38.921
Whoa. How did we miss that?
That is huge.

01:41:39.391 --> 01:41:43.885
- Max. Was that...?
- A total guess, yes, it was.

01:41:52.671 --> 01:41:55.162
That old son of a gun
can take a hit, huh?

01:42:02.514 --> 01:42:06.917
- Do you think I should tell him?
- No. Let's just savor the moment.

01:42:15.594 --> 01:42:17.926
He's a funny son of a bitch, isn't he?

01:42:18.630 --> 01:42:21.098
This is the proudest moment of my life!

01:42:24.035 --> 01:42:25.593
Bomb not go off.

01:42:25.771 --> 01:42:28.331
Oh, really, bright-eyes?
What alerted you?

01:42:28.507 --> 01:42:31.635
Was it no "Boom, boom," or the lack
of a mushroom cloud?

01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:34.506
It was the mushroom cloud for me.

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:40.349
Well, you did your job,
so I suppose I can't kill your wife.

01:42:40.752 --> 01:42:44.347
Although to be honest,
I'd be doing the sighted world a favor.

01:42:52.798 --> 01:42:55.096
What good hang time, huh?

01:42:55.834 --> 01:42:59.065
Yes, Mr. President.
Thank you and goodbye, sir.

01:42:59.271 --> 01:43:02.798
86, the President wanted me
to convey his personal thanks...

01:43:02.974 --> 01:43:06.705
...and to tell you how impressed he was
with that dragged-by-a-train thing.

01:43:06.878 --> 01:43:10.974
Well, sir, as an agent, I have trained
myself to be impervious to pain.

01:43:12.384 --> 01:43:14.614
Ah! Hey, it's Fang.

01:43:14.786 --> 01:43:17.448
I wanted him to be a surprise.

01:43:17.622 --> 01:43:20.750
99, please, nobody here
knows that we're dating.

01:43:20.926 --> 01:43:22.484
Yes, they do.

01:43:23.762 --> 01:43:25.059
On the cheek.

01:43:26.164 --> 01:43:27.893
- Let's go.
- Maybe a little one?

01:43:28.867 --> 01:43:32.769
Hey, new guy. Hold up a second.
Welcome to CONTROL.

01:43:32.938 --> 01:43:36.169
We have a tradition called "pick on
the new guy." Here's how it works.

01:43:36.341 --> 01:43:39.333
- We pick on the new guy.
- And you can't do anything about it.

01:43:39.511 --> 01:43:40.876
Let's try one.

01:43:41.713 --> 01:43:44.705
- You dropped your pencil.
- Did you hear the man?

01:43:45.116 --> 01:43:48.381
I don't see a man, I see two little girls.

01:43:48.553 --> 01:43:52.580
I think I'll call you Maureen,
and you Brittany.

01:43:52.757 --> 01:43:56.090
- New guy did not.
- New guy did.

01:43:56.261 --> 01:43:58.252
Okay, new guy...
- I got this.

01:43:58.730 --> 01:44:00.220
And I'm going to enjoy it.

01:44:00.398 --> 01:44:02.389
That will make me happy, Maureen.

01:44:02.801 --> 01:44:03.825
Maureen.

01:44:05.303 --> 01:44:06.565
Ow! What's in there?

01:44:07.138 --> 01:44:08.969
- And just for the record.
- What's in there?

01:44:10.542 --> 01:44:12.032
My name is not "new guy."

01:44:13.278 --> 01:44:14.643
My name is Hymie.

01:44:14.813 --> 01:44:17.213
Now, if you ladies will excuse me.

01:44:19.618 --> 01:44:21.381
This is gonna be so fun.

01:44:21.553 --> 01:44:23.145
Make him high-five me.

01:44:57.522 --> 01:44:58.750
Max, we're gonna be late.

01:45:02.761 --> 01:45:05.423
Oh, Max. Let Maintenance
take care of it.

01:45:09.567 --> 01:45:10.659
Ah!

01:45:10.835 --> 01:45:14.007
<i>You've gotta
be kidding me!</i>
