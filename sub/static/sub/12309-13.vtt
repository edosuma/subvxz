WEBVTT

00:02.719 --> 00:05.720
As you may have already heard,
we've received an invitation.

00:06.520 --> 00:09.520
Or, more precisely,
your team has received an invitation

00:09.880 --> 00:12.121
to represent Atlantis
at a meeting of leaders

00:12.241 --> 00:15.160
from various human populations
throughout the Pegasus Galaxy.

00:16.239 --> 00:19.238
What's this, a Pegasus version
of the United Nations?

00:19.402 --> 00:21.161
Nothing quite so formal.

00:21.281 --> 00:23.161
At the moment,
it's more of a loose coalition.

00:23.281 --> 00:26.200
ls there any advanced technology
in this coalition?

00:26.480 --> 00:28.761
No.
But the IOA believes

00:28.881 --> 00:31.800
it could be an important first step
toward interplanetary government.

00:32.159 --> 00:36.478
A federation, if you will.
- The federation had ships.

00:36.641 --> 00:37.801
Look, what do we hope to gain from this?

00:37.921 --> 00:39.161
l mean, the only reason
these people even know

00:39.281 --> 00:40.841
about each other is because
they happened to inherit

00:40.961 --> 00:42.401
the gate system from the Ancients.

00:42.521 --> 00:44.761
Just because they lack advancement
does not mean

00:44.881 --> 00:47.718
they cannot benefit from cooperation.
- She's right.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.598
It's about time people in this galaxy
got together and stood up for themselves.

00:50.761 --> 00:52.961
Against the Wraith?
- Why not?

00:53.081 --> 00:55.121
The Wraith are at war with each other,

00:55.241 --> 00:58.160
which is why the people trying to form
this coalition feel the time is right,

00:58.720 --> 01:01.720
and they want us to be part of it.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:23.800 --> 01:26.800
The council liaison will be
with you in a moment.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.560
Wow, they're really rolling
the red carpet out for us, huh?

01:31.600 --> 01:34.600
I'm sure they're just trying
to keep the details of this meeting secret.

01:36.040 --> 01:39.040
Guys, not good!
- Ronon!

03:14.320 --> 03:17.238
Where are we?

03:17.401 --> 03:20.320
We're not in the same room.
We've been moved.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.640
What the hell happened?
- That's a good question.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.440
What is the meaning of this?
- It will all be explained shortly.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.280
The council wishes to speak
to Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.478
l am Kelore of Latira.

03:53.641 --> 03:56.560
This is Shiana of the Tribes of Santhal,
and Dimas of the Free Peoples of Riva.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.401
We speak on behalf of the coalition.

04:00.521 --> 04:02.321
You know, if you wanted
to keep this location secret,

04:02.441 --> 04:05.360
you could have just blindfolded me.
l wouldn't have peeked, l swear.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.878
Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard,
you stand before this council

04:09.041 --> 04:11.838
as a representative
of the Atlantis expedition.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.041
Okay.

04:13.161 --> 04:16.079
And as such, it falls to you
to answer the charges.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.081
Excuse me?
- You will be given ample opportunity

04:20.201 --> 04:21.641
to present your defense,

04:21.761 --> 04:24.680
and when all evidence is heard,
we will decide the outcome.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.078
What the hell are you talking about?
What is this?

04:29.241 --> 04:31.241
The Atlantis expedition has been accused

04:31.361 --> 04:34.280
of crimes against
the peoples of this galaxy.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.720
This is your trial.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.498
Major, what happened?
- We're still trying to figure that out, sir.

04:46.662 --> 04:49.618
One thing's for sure,
they're not in the village anymore.

04:49.782 --> 04:52.281
They wouldn't have gone anywhere else
without notifying us first.

04:52.401 --> 04:55.118
Not voluntarily, no.

04:55.281 --> 04:57.641
Take as many men as you need.
Search the entire area

04:57.761 --> 05:00.680
and keep questioning the villagers.
Somebody there knows something.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.161
This was supposed to be
a meet-and-greet.

05:06.281 --> 05:09.200
Just cocktails, hors d'oeuvres,
maybe a little dancing?

05:09.480 --> 05:11.401
Subterfuge was necessary.

05:11.521 --> 05:13.601
You possess technology
and military power

05:13.721 --> 05:16.640
beyond the scope of most
of the indigenous peoples of this galaxy.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.081
Which is why you have been brought
to a secure location.

05:19.201 --> 05:22.120
Only the members of this council
and key personnel know the gate address.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.118
So don't waste your time entertaining
any hopes of rescue.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.401
What is it exactly that you think we did?

05:27.521 --> 05:29.161
According to our calculations,

05:29.281 --> 05:32.200
the Atlantis expedition is responsible,
directly or indirectly,

05:32.680 --> 05:35.638
for the deaths
of over two million people in this galaxy.

05:35.802 --> 05:37.361
You've got to be kidding me.

05:37.481 --> 05:40.400
Tell us about your first encounter
with the Wraith.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.121
Okay, l see where this is going.

05:45.241 --> 05:46.721
When you arrived here,

05:46.841 --> 05:49.281
the Wraith were in hibernation,
were they not?

05:49.401 --> 05:51.998
Not all of them.
- What do you mean?

05:52.161 --> 05:55.080
l mean they attacked us.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.620
What is it?

06:11.761 --> 06:14.680
The Wraith.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.160
Take that thing down!

06:29.200 --> 06:32.200
That's one.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.200
Get down!

06:39.320 --> 06:41.041
Teyla?

06:41.161 --> 06:43.678
That was a scouting party, not a culling.

06:43.841 --> 06:46.478
Well, l didn't know that.
All l know is they took our people.

06:46.641 --> 06:48.281
And you went after them.
- That's right.

06:48.401 --> 06:49.681
You should have left them to their fate.

06:49.801 --> 06:52.720
I'm sure that's what you would've done,
but that's not how we operate.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.441
What happened?

06:54.561 --> 06:57.001
Well, we went in,
we rescued as many people as we could,

06:57.121 --> 07:00.040
then we got out.
- But not before encountering a queen.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.280
No.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.860
How did this come to you?

07:15.001 --> 07:17.920
l don't remember.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.880
Light it up.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.680
That has to kill you.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.641
Sir, let's go.

07:39.761 --> 07:42.680
You don't know what you have done.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.360
We are merely the caretakers
for those that sleep.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.480
When l die, the others will awaken.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
All of them.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.280
What's she talking about?
How many are left?

08:22.840 --> 08:25.840
So you admit it. You woke the Wraith.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.078
Look, sooner or later, they were going
to wake up on their own anyway.

08:29.241 --> 08:31.121
But not for generations.

08:31.241 --> 08:32.561
You see, Colonel,

08:32.681 --> 08:34.961
most of the human populations
of this galaxy

08:35.081 --> 08:37.878
have not yet fully recovered
from the last round of cullings.

08:38.041 --> 08:39.441
As a result of this early awakening,

08:39.561 --> 08:42.061
several worlds have been driven
to the point of extinction,

08:42.201 --> 08:45.120
their survivors scattered,
their civilizations lost forever.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.878
We're out there fighting the Wraith
day after day,

08:48.041 --> 08:49.241
putting our asses on the line.

08:49.361 --> 08:50.801
But the fact remains,

08:50.921 --> 08:53.201
many who have been killed
would be alive today

08:53.321 --> 08:55.041
if you had never come here,
isn't that true?

08:55.161 --> 08:57.401
That's it,
I'm not playing this game anymore.

08:57.521 --> 09:00.038
This is just the first of many charges.

09:00.201 --> 09:01.881
If you refuse to participate,

09:02.001 --> 09:04.241
it will be taken as an admission of guilt
on all counts,

09:04.361 --> 09:06.841
and we will have no choice
but to proceed to sentencing.

09:06.961 --> 09:09.880
What are you going to do,
put everybody in Atlantis in jail?

09:10.480 --> 09:13.480
Obviously that's not possible.
However, we can refuse cooperation.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.038
That means no more trade,
no more relations of any kind.

09:19.201 --> 09:21.758
Atlantis will be completely isolated.

09:21.921 --> 09:24.840
No relations with the likes of you?
l think we can handle that.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.280
The coalition grows in strength
and influence every day.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.920
Soon enough, all of your current
trading partners will have no choice

09:32.440 --> 09:35.440
but to join and therefore to abide
by the ruling of this council.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
As for you and your team,
an example must be made.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.480
Justice demands it.
- Justice, is that what you're calling this?

09:44.040 --> 09:46.918
A suitable uninhabited planet
has been chosen.

09:47.081 --> 09:49.201
If you're found guilty,
you will be sent there

09:49.321 --> 09:52.240
without any hope of return
for the rest of your natural lives.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.720
Apparently, the planet they picked for us
has just enough food for us to survive,

10:02.360 --> 10:05.298
so technically it's not an execution.

10:05.462 --> 10:07.601
Great.
- And they took the DHD,

10:07.721 --> 10:10.640
so whoever comes through the gate,
they're not coming back.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.081
The Daedalus can find us.

10:12.201 --> 10:14.001
If they had the address, but short of that,

10:14.121 --> 10:15.521
they'd need to search
every solar system in the galaxy

10:15.641 --> 10:18.398
for a habitable planet, which would take
all of what, a million years?

10:18.561 --> 10:20.201
All right, let's not panic.

10:20.321 --> 10:22.041
I've been to the chamber
a couple of times now

10:22.161 --> 10:24.521
and I'm beginning to get
a sense of the layout.

10:24.641 --> 10:26.961
Well, the architecture is
definitely different from that of the village.

10:27.081 --> 10:28.681
No, we're on another planet.

10:28.801 --> 10:31.658
Judging from the fact
there's no natural light or windows,

10:31.822 --> 10:33.641
I'm guessing an underground bunker.

10:33.761 --> 10:36.261
Guards?
- Yeah, half a dozen or so.

10:36.401 --> 10:38.081
We're going to have to see
if they change in shifts.

10:38.201 --> 10:39.241
l don't suppose there's any chance

10:39.361 --> 10:40.801
you could just convince them
that we're not guilty?

10:40.921 --> 10:43.838
'Cause we're not, right?

10:44.002 --> 10:46.678
Come on, there is no way
the Pegasus Galaxy would be better off

10:46.841 --> 10:48.641
if we'd never come here.
- No.

10:48.761 --> 10:50.441
But since your arrival,
there have been setbacks.

10:50.561 --> 10:52.041
Lives have been lost.

10:52.161 --> 10:55.080
But there is hope now
where once there was none.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.560
Look, as much as I'd like to tell these guys
where to put their little trial,

10:59.080 --> 11:00.441
we're just going to have
to play along for a while

11:00.561 --> 11:03.480
until we figure out how to get out of here.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.998
Mr. Woolsey, this is Myrus.

11:13.161 --> 11:16.080
He claims to be a representative
for the new coalition of planets.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.760
Does he?
- Are you the leader of Atlantis?

11:20.320 --> 11:23.320
That's right.
- Then we need to speak.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.281
Well, what's next on the agenda?

11:26.401 --> 11:29.320
Did we step on the rose bushes
on our last trip to Vedeena?

11:30.640 --> 11:31.921
Perhaps you've heard of a plague

11:32.041 --> 11:34.401
that's recently swept
through several worlds,

11:34.521 --> 11:37.440
a sickness that arrives suddenly,
runs its course in a matter of days,

11:38.440 --> 11:41.238
and typically kills one out of every
three men, women, and children

11:41.401 --> 11:43.401
wherever it strikes?

11:43.521 --> 11:46.001
There are those who believe
it is not a sickness at all

11:46.121 --> 11:49.040
but a deliberate poisoning,
the work of one individual.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.641
l know who you're talking about.
His name is Michael.

11:52.761 --> 11:55.201
It is said that he is
neither human nor Wraith,

11:55.321 --> 11:57.481
but some kind of half-breed.

11:57.601 --> 12:00.520
Can you explain to us
how such a thing is possible?

12:02.080 --> 12:04.441
One of our people
was conducting research.

12:04.561 --> 12:05.641
They were trying to come up with a way

12:05.761 --> 12:08.680
to solve the Wraith problem
once and for all.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.318
You found a way to convert
Wraith into humans?

12:31.481 --> 12:33.961
Don't ask me the medical questions.
I'm not a doctor.

12:34.081 --> 12:36.718
And this Michael was
one of your test subjects?

12:36.881 --> 12:39.800
As a matter of fact, he was the first.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.920
Blood pressure's fine. Pulse, normal.
You're bouncing back quite nicely.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.158
Bouncing back from what?
- Hello, Michael.

12:49.321 --> 12:52.240
Do you remember me?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.281
No.

12:54.401 --> 12:57.320
I'm Dr. Elizabeth Weir.
This is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.720
You serve under my command.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.040
Your name is
Lieutenant Michael Kenmore.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.520
You're in a private room
off the infirmary here in Atlantis.

13:09.320 --> 13:12.320
ls that familiar to you?

13:12.640 --> 13:15.478
Atlantis?

13:15.641 --> 13:18.560
Yeah, l think.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.738
<i>We tried to convince him
he was one of us.</i>

13:21.902 --> 13:24.840
<i>But he knew something was wrong,
and then he found proof.</i>

13:30.400 --> 13:33.400
<i>Quick, five milligrams!</i>

13:41.120 --> 13:44.120
<i>Release me!</i>

13:52.840 --> 13:55.518
<i>You will die for this!</i>

13:55.681 --> 13:57.921
<i>Others will come for me!
They will destroy you.</i>

13:58.041 --> 14:00.960
<i>Blah, blah, blah.
- They gotta find us first.</i>

14:01.880 --> 14:04.880
<i>You're gonna need a name.
How does Mike sound?</i>

14:14.320 --> 14:16.281
After that, he escaped.

14:16.401 --> 14:19.038
He went back and forth between Wraith
and human a couple more times

14:19.201 --> 14:22.120
until finally
he settled somewhere in between.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.238
So once again you admit your guilt.

14:25.401 --> 14:28.320
You unleashed this thing on the galaxy.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.681
We didn't just let him out the front door
and forget about him.

14:30.801 --> 14:33.301
We've been chasing him ever since.

14:33.441 --> 14:36.360
A couple of months ago,
we managed to catch up with him.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.760
Fire in the hole.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.638
What happened?
- The hyper-drive just exploded.

14:54.801 --> 14:56.241
No, that's impossible.

14:56.361 --> 14:58.081
Main power is out
across much of the ship.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.878
An accidental overload?
- It doesn't appear that way.

15:01.041 --> 15:02.561
How did they do that?

15:02.681 --> 15:05.600
l will look into it.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.761
Daedalus, please come in.

15:08.881 --> 15:10.841
Colonel Sheppard,
what the hell happened to your Jumper?

15:10.961 --> 15:13.880
l got turned around in the parking garage.
l was in a rush, so l borrowed this Dart.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.078
I've got the team
beamed into a storage device.

15:17.241 --> 15:19.641
Feel free to do whatever you want
to that cruiser.

15:19.761 --> 15:22.680
Major Marks,
please make that ship go away.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.560
Yes, sir.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.481
Are you sure he was killed?

15:37.601 --> 15:39.801
His ship was vaporized.
There was no body to recover.

15:39.921 --> 15:42.361
Well, then,
you cannot testify before this council,

15:42.481 --> 15:45.400
and under the eyes of the ancestors,
that you know for certain that he is dead.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.561
No.

15:52.681 --> 15:54.081
This is outrageous.

15:54.201 --> 15:56.081
You're telling me
that one of the first official acts

15:56.201 --> 15:58.878
of your new government was
to assault and kidnap my people?

15:59.041 --> 16:01.361
They weren't assaulted.
They were arrested.

16:01.481 --> 16:02.801
You've got to be kidding me.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.801
Believe me, not all of us agreed
with this decision,

16:04.921 --> 16:06.881
but it wasn't taken
entirely without reason.

16:07.001 --> 16:08.521
We've been trying to help you people.

16:08.641 --> 16:11.238
What you've been doing is making
unilateral decisions

16:11.401 --> 16:13.161
that affect the lives of millions,

16:13.281 --> 16:16.138
without consultation
and without accountability.

16:16.302 --> 16:17.601
This is no longer acceptable.

16:17.721 --> 16:19.721
I'm not going to get drawn
into a debate here.

16:19.841 --> 16:22.760
l only need to know one thing,
where are my people being held?

16:24.800 --> 16:26.481
Of course l can't tell you that.

16:26.601 --> 16:29.041
Fair trials don't take place
in secret locations.

16:29.161 --> 16:31.321
Nevertheless...
- l think Mr. Myrus needs a little time

16:31.441 --> 16:33.401
to reconsider his position here.

16:33.521 --> 16:36.440
Escort him to a cell.
- My pleasure.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.960
You're making a mistake.
- Am l?

16:42.880 --> 16:44.681
When l was chosen
to deliver this message,

16:44.801 --> 16:47.081
l knew there was a chance
l wouldn't be coming back,

16:47.201 --> 16:48.201
but if you detain me,

16:48.321 --> 16:50.838
you will only be confirming
what many already suspect,

16:51.001 --> 16:53.281
that you're a rogue element in this galaxy,

16:53.401 --> 16:56.320
operating without restraint
or due process.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.480
Lock him up.
- Let's go.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.718
All right, I'm not saying
we haven't made some mistakes,

17:14.881 --> 17:17.281
but that's 'cause
we're the only ones out there fighting.

17:17.401 --> 17:19.320
Nobody else is out there
taking on the Wraith.

17:19.441 --> 17:21.958
But isn't that your own fault as well?

17:22.121 --> 17:23.481
What are you talking about?

17:23.601 --> 17:26.040
The Genii had a plan to combat the Wraith,

17:26.161 --> 17:29.080
but they were thwarted
when you betrayed them.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.600
ls that what they told you?
Because that's not what l remember.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.320
Where's my father?

17:41.240 --> 17:43.481
He did not survive.

17:43.601 --> 17:46.520
How? What happened?
- l think we should find out.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.480
Take aim!

17:58.720 --> 18:01.720
Cowen, l thought we were just learning
how to get along.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.480
She killed Tyrus.
- No.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.761
By leaving him to die,

18:06.881 --> 18:09.800
you may just as well
have killed him yourself.

18:11.240 --> 18:14.240
We will keep this intelligence information
and your ship,

18:15.800 --> 18:18.598
and whatever quantities of C-4
you have in your possession.

18:18.761 --> 18:21.241
That is all you ever intended, to use us.

18:21.361 --> 18:24.280
Your weapons.
- No, l don't think so.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.441
This is what your father died for?

18:27.561 --> 18:29.201
In the name of people
who would lie and steal

18:29.321 --> 18:31.201
from those they would call friends?

18:31.321 --> 18:32.841
Well, l lied, too.

18:32.961 --> 18:35.880
Jumpers 2 and 3, execute.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.400
You didn't really think
we had one ship, did you?

18:43.320 --> 18:45.041
So you betrayed each other.

18:45.161 --> 18:48.080
We came prepared.
They made the first move.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.960
Look, the Genii plan was never going
to work anyways.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.921
They had bombs they couldn't finish
without our help,

18:56.041 --> 18:58.960
they had no methods of delivery.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.158
If you want a military victory
against the Wraith,

19:02.322 --> 19:04.761
we're your only chance.

19:04.881 --> 19:07.161
You've been in touch
with our off-world contacts?

19:07.281 --> 19:09.481
Yes, sir.
- And?

19:09.601 --> 19:12.520
Nobody knows anything,
at least that's what they're saying.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.001
You don't believe them?

19:14.121 --> 19:16.361
Well, frankly, right now,
l don't know what to believe, sir.

19:16.481 --> 19:17.761
l mean, these people are
supposed to be our friends,

19:17.881 --> 19:19.841
but if we can't just walk
into an ordinary village

19:19.961 --> 19:21.921
without worrying about an ambush,
what's the point?

19:22.041 --> 19:23.201
We're not there yet.

19:23.321 --> 19:25.878
l refuse to believe that
the whole galaxy has turned against us.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.960
Well, it might as well,
because right now we have nothing.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.520
Maybe not. Come with me.

19:36.120 --> 19:39.120
Open it.

19:40.200 --> 19:43.200
Mr. Myrus, l have a proposal for you.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.400
So you claim to have had military success
against the Wraith?

19:47.760 --> 19:48.881
We've done our share of damage,

19:49.001 --> 19:51.281
even managed to take
a few hive ships out here and there.

19:51.401 --> 19:52.361
Really?

19:52.481 --> 19:55.398
And how did you manage
to accomplish this remarkable feat?

19:55.562 --> 19:57.681
Well, l can tell you one thing,
it's never easy,

19:57.801 --> 20:00.720
but one good trick is to get them
to shoot at each other.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.081
Look. See that?

20:15.201 --> 20:18.120
It's a Dart firing on one of the hive ships.
- Why?

20:18.880 --> 20:21.880
Sheppard.

20:33.120 --> 20:36.120
Sheppard's actually getting them
to fire at each other.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.761
Now, if two hive ships are going at it,

20:48.881 --> 20:49.881
and you happen to be
on-board one of them,

20:50.001 --> 20:51.401
that can be a bit of a problem.

20:51.521 --> 20:52.921
That's when you have to improvise.

20:53.041 --> 20:54.241
Teyla, Lorne, come in.

20:54.361 --> 20:55.841
Colonel, where are you?
- We're on our way.

20:55.961 --> 20:58.161
You must hurry.
The other hive has found us.

20:58.281 --> 20:59.441
Can you hold 'em off?

20:59.561 --> 21:02.480
Not for long.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.601
Approaching Dart Bay.

21:05.721 --> 21:07.281
Acknowledged.

21:07.401 --> 21:08.441
They're inside.

21:08.561 --> 21:11.198
Colonel, request permission
to jump to hyperspace immediately.

21:11.361 --> 21:12.881
Negative. I have another idea.

21:13.001 --> 21:15.920
Teyla, l want you to set a new course.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.081
Commander.
- What is it?

21:23.201 --> 21:26.120
We just received
an urgent communication from the hive.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.880
The enemy, they're headed straight for us.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.841
Did also mention
that we have a fair amount

21:43.961 --> 21:45.441
of Ancient technology at our disposal?

21:45.561 --> 21:46.801
Because that can be pretty handy, too.

21:46.921 --> 21:48.681
There's a hive bearing down
on your position.

21:48.801 --> 21:50.081
Yes, sir, l see that.

21:50.201 --> 21:52.918
Stand by. Doc, you're killing us here.
- Okay. l have it. l have it. l have it.

21:53.081 --> 21:56.000
Firing drones!

22:16.440 --> 22:18.241
Let's see, what else did l leave out?

22:18.361 --> 22:20.521
There's been so many over the years,
it's hard to keep track.

22:20.641 --> 22:22.961
Enough.

22:23.081 --> 22:26.000
You spin a colorful tale, Colonel,
that much is obvious.

22:26.360 --> 22:29.360
Yet for all these fantastic claims,
we have no evidence but your word.

22:30.360 --> 22:33.318
This trial is evidence.
None of this would be happening,

22:33.482 --> 22:36.440
your precious little coalition
wouldn't even exist

22:36.720 --> 22:38.961
if we hadn't have pushed
the Wraith so far back

22:39.081 --> 22:41.998
that you got an opportunity
you haven't had in 10,000 years.

22:42.162 --> 22:45.138
Your responsibility in this
has already been determined.

22:45.302 --> 22:46.401
You woke the Wraith early

22:46.521 --> 22:49.418
before the population of this galaxy
had sufficient time to recover,

22:49.582 --> 22:50.761
which eventually led to the Wraith

22:50.881 --> 22:53.321
going to war with each other
over feeding grounds.

22:53.441 --> 22:55.941
That war is what has given us
this opportunity,

22:56.081 --> 22:59.000
not some imagined victory on your part.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.240
We will take a recess.
Please take the prisoner back to his cell.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.481
Woolsey, what the hell
are you doing here?

23:39.601 --> 23:41.881
I've made an arrangement
with your captors.

23:42.001 --> 23:44.920
I'm taking over your defense.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.441
l don't suppose
you managed to bring along

23:48.561 --> 23:51.061
a subspace locator beacon, did you?

23:51.201 --> 23:54.120
That's Wraith technology.
It's not like we have one just lying around.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.720
l even tried to contact Todd
to see if we could borrow one,

24:01.040 --> 24:02.641
but he never responded.

24:02.761 --> 24:04.241
What about the DHD on the planet
where we were ambushed?

24:04.361 --> 24:05.481
l mean, you could pull
the most recent addresses

24:05.601 --> 24:06.601
that were dialed from that.

24:06.721 --> 24:08.921
Already done, there were
over 50 addresses in the buffer.

24:09.041 --> 24:11.678
l almost cleaned out the entire city
sending people to investigate all of them,

24:11.841 --> 24:13.681
but they turned up nothing.

24:13.801 --> 24:16.720
They took us through more than one gate.
- So it would seem.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
This was obviously very well thought out.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.278
All right, well, they had a very clever plan,
but we're smarter and better armed.

24:23.441 --> 24:24.441
There's got to be a way around this.

24:24.561 --> 24:27.480
They took advantage
of one significant weakness.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.760
We trusted them.

24:34.760 --> 24:37.041
Look, l came here

24:37.161 --> 24:40.080
because l have a plan
to get you out of here.

24:42.280 --> 24:45.280
What is it?
- Win the trial.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.321
Look, we were just playing along

24:50.441 --> 24:52.881
to buy us enough time to figure out
a way out of here.

24:53.001 --> 24:55.920
And how's that coming along?
- Well, we're working on it.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.761
l was Harvard Law Review.

24:59.881 --> 25:02.800
l was chief counsel
of the US Army Corps of Engineers.

25:03.040 --> 25:06.040
Prior to that, l was an appellate advocate
for Hartshorne & Slaughter,

25:06.880 --> 25:09.880
one of the most prestigious
litigation boutiques in all New York City.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.560
Believe me, l can handle three tribal elders
with a stack of papyrus.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.401
Some time ago,

25:23.521 --> 25:26.440
a number of human worlds were attacked
and destroyed from space,

25:27.040 --> 25:29.758
not by the Wraith, but by someone else.

25:29.921 --> 25:31.961
Little is known of this mysterious race

25:32.081 --> 25:34.978
except that they possess
incredibly advanced technology,

25:35.142 --> 25:37.441
and are rumored to be allies of Atlantis.

25:37.561 --> 25:40.480
l think l know who you're referring to
and, believe me, they are not our allies.

25:43.040 --> 25:46.040
They're called Replicators.
They were created by the Ancients.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.600
If you wish to know the truth
of who we are, l will show you.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.081
The Ancients, as you call them,

26:01.201 --> 26:04.118
were desperate in their search
for a better way to fight the Wraith.

26:04.282 --> 26:05.361
Though greatly outnumbered,

26:05.481 --> 26:07.481
they relied on their
technological superiority

26:07.601 --> 26:09.601
to give them a needed advantage.

26:09.721 --> 26:11.521
Instead of building bigger,
more powerful weapons,

26:11.641 --> 26:13.281
they chose to build smaller ones.

26:13.401 --> 26:16.320
Nanites.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.961
In these tiny killing machines,

26:20.081 --> 26:23.000
the Ancients imbued an aggression
that surpassed even that of their enemy.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.960
The technology allowed for
organic assimilation and self-replication

26:27.280 --> 26:30.280
to increase their effectiveness,
and replicate they did.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.880
They grew in numbers, evolving at a rate
that took the Ancients by surprise.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.241
The molecular machines
began interlocking,

26:43.361 --> 26:46.280
assembling themselves to form
even more complex organisms,

26:46.960 --> 26:49.960
eventually evolving into the most effective
and efficient form they knew of.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.758
This is how we were born.

26:55.921 --> 26:56.961
When the Ancients concluded

26:57.081 --> 27:00.000
that we would never become the weapon
they desired to create,

27:00.360 --> 27:03.360
they decided to end it.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.560
So they chose to destroy us,
to leave no trace of us behind.

27:16.520 --> 27:19.238
Some of them managed to survive.
- That's right.

27:19.401 --> 27:21.361
And as the name suggests,

27:21.481 --> 27:24.400
they replicated and rebuilt themselves
into a powerful force.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.400
Oh, my...
- No kidding.

27:45.680 --> 27:48.161
But why would they attack human worlds?

27:48.281 --> 27:51.200
It was a strategy they developed
in their campaign against the Wraith.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.280
Eliminate the enemy's food supply.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.601
There's one thing l don't understand,
Mr. Woolsey.

28:02.721 --> 28:05.640
If, as you suggest, they were
originally designed to fight the Wraith,

28:06.600 --> 28:09.600
why did they wait until now?

28:10.920 --> 28:12.321
Hook up the ZPM. We're leaving.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.721
Wait a minute. We can't go.
- What are you talking about?

28:14.841 --> 28:16.881
You said you could get
the hyper-drive back on-line.

28:17.001 --> 28:18.041
l mean, we can, but not yet.

28:18.161 --> 28:19.681
Look, while Elizabeth's been connected,

28:19.801 --> 28:21.801
I've been going over
the Replicator's base code,

28:21.921 --> 28:24.598
and l found this.

28:24.761 --> 28:27.241
What is that?

28:27.361 --> 28:30.280
The Holy Grail.
It's their whole reason for being.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.961
It's a command code
that directs them to attack the Wraith.

28:33.081 --> 28:34.641
Yeah, but they don't attack the Wraith.

28:34.761 --> 28:37.598
They've been sitting on their nanite asses
for 10,000 years.

28:37.761 --> 28:39.841
Well, that's because it's been deactivated.

28:39.961 --> 28:41.201
Are you telling us

28:41.321 --> 28:43.521
that you are the ones
that activated the attack code?

28:43.641 --> 28:46.278
We didn't know they were going
to target human worlds.

28:46.441 --> 28:49.078
No, because you acted rashly
without considering the consequences.

28:49.241 --> 28:51.361
We had an opportunity,

28:51.481 --> 28:53.921
one that wasn't going
to present itself again.

28:54.041 --> 28:56.960
Believe me, councilors,
this decision was not taken lightly.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.560
In fact, it cost us one of our best people.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.481
Elizabeth.

29:08.601 --> 29:11.520
Get to the Jumper!
- You're coming with us.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.878
l can't keep them frozen much longer!

29:15.041 --> 29:16.921
We're not leaving you behind!

29:17.041 --> 29:18.841
If you don't leave right now,

29:18.961 --> 29:21.880
none of us will get out of here, so go!
That's an order!

29:23.320 --> 29:25.121
Come on!
- Elizabeth!

29:25.241 --> 29:28.160
Go!

29:30.080 --> 29:33.080
One of your people died,
and you consider this a grave sacrifice?

29:34.800 --> 29:35.921
As a matter of fact, l do.

29:36.041 --> 29:38.161
Then imagine how we feel,

29:38.281 --> 29:40.681
those of us who have witnessed
the deaths of thousands.

29:40.801 --> 29:43.678
We cannot be held responsible
for the actions of the Replicators.

29:43.842 --> 29:45.121
Colonel Sheppard
made the same argument

29:45.241 --> 29:46.641
in respect to the Wraith,

29:46.761 --> 29:49.518
and in that case,
l might be inclined to agree with him.

29:49.681 --> 29:52.600
But by your own admission,
these Replicators are machines.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.521
So if l were to set a detonator,

29:54.641 --> 29:57.560
can l then later deny responsibility
for the actions of the bomb?

29:59.360 --> 30:01.641
By that logic,
you might just as well blame the Ancients.

30:01.761 --> 30:02.721
They created them.

30:02.841 --> 30:05.760
The Ancients, as you call them,
are not here to answer for their actions.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.801
You are.

30:07.921 --> 30:10.840
We know for certain of six human worlds
that were destroyed by the Replicators,

30:11.280 --> 30:14.280
but we also know of at least
a dozen hive ships that were destroyed,

30:16.040 --> 30:19.040
hive ships that would almost certainly
have culled within a year.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.321
One could make the argument
that, on balance,

30:21.441 --> 30:24.360
more lives were saved than were lost.

30:24.560 --> 30:27.560
"On balance"? ls that what we are to you?
Figures on a ledger,

30:29.800 --> 30:32.478
pieces that can be moved about
in a game of strategy,

30:32.641 --> 30:35.398
some to be saved
while others are sacrificed?

30:35.561 --> 30:36.841
I'm sorry,
l certainly didn't mean to diminish...

30:36.961 --> 30:39.798
Real people are being killed, Mr. Woolsey,

30:39.961 --> 30:42.880
real villages destroyed,
my village, my people.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.960
My husband and children
murdered before my eyes.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.478
You're from one of the planets
destroyed by the Replicators.

30:52.641 --> 30:54.561
l barely escaped with my life,

30:54.681 --> 30:57.600
but not before l saw everything l hold dear

30:59.120 --> 31:02.120
get wiped out by a beam of light
from the sky.

31:05.960 --> 31:08.960
And l will not rest
until someone is made to pay for it.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.121
Well, l guess we can rule out
getting her vote.

31:21.241 --> 31:24.160
It's clearly inappropriate for someone
that biased to be on the council.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.761
So they stacked the deck against us.

31:27.881 --> 31:30.800
I'm not sure.
Dimas seems to be a reasonable man.

31:31.800 --> 31:34.638
l think he might even be persuaded
to vote our way.

31:34.801 --> 31:37.720
Kelore is a little harder to read.
- Yeah, he seemed pretty hostile to me.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.518
Didn't you say he was from Latira?
- Yeah, that's right.

31:42.681 --> 31:44.681
One of our last
intelligence reports suggests

31:44.801 --> 31:47.720
a growing relationship
between Latira and the Genii.

31:49.320 --> 31:50.841
Yeah, he did try to convince me

31:50.961 --> 31:53.361
that they should be the ones leading
the fight against the Wraith.

31:53.481 --> 31:56.400
You think the Genii are behind this?
- It makes sense.

31:57.640 --> 31:58.721
Apart from Atlantis,

31:58.841 --> 32:01.598
they're clearly the biggest military power
in the coalition.

32:01.761 --> 32:04.261
If they played their cards right,
they can wind up running the whole thing.

32:04.401 --> 32:06.241
But only with us out of the picture.

32:06.361 --> 32:08.481
So we were right all along.
This whole thing's fixed.

32:08.601 --> 32:11.318
l say we go to plan B,
wait for the guards to come in,

32:11.481 --> 32:13.761
l beat them up, take their guns,
we shoot our way out of here.

32:13.881 --> 32:15.001
Do we even know the way out?

32:15.121 --> 32:17.081
Well, we know we're at least
two levels underground,

32:17.201 --> 32:20.058
and there's no more than
a dozen or so guards at any one time.

32:20.222 --> 32:22.681
What about on the surface?
How many guards are up there?

32:22.801 --> 32:25.518
And which way is the gate? And how far?

32:25.681 --> 32:28.181
There's a few things
we'll have to figure out along the way.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.281
It's too risky.

32:29.401 --> 32:31.881
We could wind up being shot
before we even got out of the building.

32:32.001 --> 32:34.920
What other choice do we have?
l mean, we know we can't win this thing.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.640
Not fairly, no.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.041
What are you talking about?

32:42.161 --> 32:45.080
I'm saying, now that l know
what the game is, l can play it.

32:53.320 --> 32:56.320
Kelore, thank you for agreeing to meet me.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.400
Wait outside.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.680
It cost me rather a fine pocket watch
that used to belong to my father

33:08.240 --> 33:10.241
to get him to bring me here.

33:10.361 --> 33:13.158
You shouldn't have bothered.
There's nothing l can do for you.

33:13.321 --> 33:15.838
Well, maybe I'm just feeling
generous tonight.

33:16.001 --> 33:18.920
Speak plainly.
- You're backing the wrong horse.

33:20.040 --> 33:23.040
We know you're connected with the Genii.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.721
l don't know what you're talking about.

33:28.841 --> 33:31.760
We also know they're looking to become
the military muscle behind the coalition.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.758
We think we'd make a better choice.

33:37.921 --> 33:40.840
You? Atlantis?
- That's right.

33:42.280 --> 33:45.280
Well, l didn't realize you had
those kinds of ambitions.

33:46.480 --> 33:49.480
We've been content to keep
to ourselves up until now,

33:50.280 --> 33:53.158
but if it's a choice
between getting pushed out of the game

33:53.321 --> 33:56.240
and taking a more active part,
well, that's no choice at all, is it?

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Of course, for appearances' sake,
we can't be too aggressive,

34:01.720 --> 34:04.720
so we'll need someone on the inside
to help push our agenda,

34:08.560 --> 34:11.560
someone to whom
we'll be very, very grateful.

34:14.639 --> 34:17.358
And how do l know you haven't made
this offer to the others?

34:17.521 --> 34:20.440
l think we both know
Dimas will only be swayed by reason,

34:21.840 --> 34:24.840
and Shiana's going to vote against us,
no matter what.

34:30.120 --> 34:33.120
That leaves you.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.040
Mr. Woolsey, are you ready
to face the final charge?

34:48.280 --> 34:49.801
l am.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.840
The people of Atlantis stand accused
of conspiring with the Wraith.

34:53.679 --> 34:55.081
"Conspiring"?
- We have reports

34:55.201 --> 34:57.758
that Atlantis has negotiated
with the Wraith and performed

34:57.921 --> 35:00.121
military operations with them.

35:00.241 --> 35:03.160
It is said you have formed an alliance
with one Wraith in particular.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.478
Todd.

35:06.641 --> 35:09.560
That's what we call him.

35:09.880 --> 35:12.880
This Wraith was imprisoned
with Colonel Sheppard by the Genii.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.601
The Wraith was allowed to feed on him,

35:15.721 --> 35:17.601
but, despite this,
Colonel Sheppard realized

35:17.721 --> 35:20.640
that their best chance of escape
was to work together.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.761
Which way?

36:07.881 --> 36:10.800
This way.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.478
And you continue to have dealings
with this Wraith?

36:14.641 --> 36:17.238
We have occasional contact.

36:17.401 --> 36:19.601
You trust him?
- Of course not.

36:19.721 --> 36:22.640
But he has proven to be useful at times.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.721
He helped us hold off the Replicator fleet

36:24.841 --> 36:27.760
long enough for Dr. McKay
to enact a plan to destroy them.

36:35.080 --> 36:37.001
Heavy damage and interior suction.

36:37.121 --> 36:40.040
Transferring power from
non-critical systems to hull regeneration.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.721
Our shields can't take
much more of this, sir.

36:47.841 --> 36:49.601
Hopefully, they won't have to.

36:49.721 --> 36:52.640
Now get ready to transfer power
from the beam weapons to the...

37:04.480 --> 37:07.480
What the hell?
- Son of a bitch.

37:08.120 --> 37:11.120
He actually did it.

37:19.280 --> 37:22.280
We need to get out of here.
- All right, let's go. Come on!

37:32.080 --> 37:34.838
As much as I'd love to, we shouldn't
stick around and watch this go down.

37:35.001 --> 37:37.241
We should tell the fleet to jump to
the rendezvous point immediately.

37:37.361 --> 37:40.280
The planet's become unstable.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.681
The fact is

38:00.801 --> 38:03.678
we would never have defeated
the Replicators without his help.

38:03.842 --> 38:05.841
l think it's safe to say
they would have continued

38:05.961 --> 38:08.880
their policy of attacking human worlds
and by now,

38:09.680 --> 38:12.680
everyone in this galaxy would be dead.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.041
Very well.

38:20.161 --> 38:23.080
As that was the final charge,
we will recess to deliberate.

38:24.200 --> 38:27.200
I'd like to make
one final statement, if l may.

38:29.480 --> 38:30.881
Very well.

38:31.001 --> 38:33.920
The Wraith are in disarray,
but that won't last forever.

38:35.840 --> 38:38.840
Sooner or later,
one faction will win out over the others,

38:39.680 --> 38:41.161
and when that happens,

38:41.281 --> 38:44.200
they will turn their attention to
this coalition with a ruthless vengeance

38:44.840 --> 38:47.840
the likes of which you've never seen.

38:50.520 --> 38:53.398
If you don't want us there
when that day comes,

38:53.561 --> 38:56.358
fighting by your side,

38:56.521 --> 38:59.440
then, by all means, vote us guilty.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.800
l need no deliberation.
l say we get this over with now.

39:09.080 --> 39:12.080
Very well.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.920
l vote guilty on all charges.

39:18.040 --> 39:21.040
l vote not guilty on all charges.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.440
It falls to you, Kelore.
Yours is the deciding vote.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.041
Well? What's the word?

39:49.161 --> 39:51.121
Not guilty.
- Thank God.

39:51.241 --> 39:54.160
We're free to go.
- l never doubted you for a second.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.321
Nice suit.

40:09.441 --> 40:12.360
Being back in the courtroom
made me miss my old uniform.

40:12.720 --> 40:15.720
You're kidding.
- Not the job, just the uniform.

40:18.680 --> 40:21.680
That's nice.
- Well, it seemed appropriate.

40:25.480 --> 40:28.418
So, you going to tell me
how you managed to pull this one off?

40:28.582 --> 40:30.961
Well, I'd say
it was a combination of things,

40:31.081 --> 40:34.000
my legal skills, my eloquence,
the indisputable logic of my arguments,

40:36.560 --> 40:39.560
and the bribe l offered Kelore.
- Yeah.

40:42.760 --> 40:44.801
On top of that,

40:44.921 --> 40:47.840
l had to commit Atlantis
to a much larger day-to-day participation

40:49.760 --> 40:52.760
in the politics of the Pegasus Galaxy.
Can't wait to explain that in my report.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.761
Yeah, well,
what's the point of being out here

40:56.881 --> 40:58.761
if we are not going to try
to make a difference, right?

40:58.881 --> 41:01.678
Let's hope the IOA agrees with you.

41:01.841 --> 41:04.760
Let's worry about that later.
For now, congratulations.
