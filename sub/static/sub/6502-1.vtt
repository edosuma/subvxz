02:59.960 --> 03:02.758
- Easy.
- Mornin'.

03:02.840 --> 03:06.389
Mornin'. Y'all mind
steppin' aside?

03:06.480 --> 03:10.109
- You know what I think?
- No, sir, I don't.

03:10.200 --> 03:14.193
I think you got yourselves
a shipment of gold in that wagon...

03:14.280 --> 03:16.919
that you're bringin'
to General Lee.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.675
- Just who might you be?
- A friend of the Confederacy.

03:20.760 --> 03:24.639
Why don't y'all show us what a
good friend you are by steppin' aside?

03:24.720 --> 03:27.712
I'd be most happy to,
'cept first...

03:27.800 --> 03:30.473
I'd be much obliged
if you'd give me that gold.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.837
I don't think I heard you correct.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.992
I think you did.
I'd like that gold now.

03:39.080 --> 03:42.675
Listen, mister, it ain't
very nice out here, as you can see.

03:42.760 --> 03:45.115
There are five of us.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.670
If you don't step aside now,
I'd just as soon kill you as not.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.957
You wanna die out here in this
miserable weather, that's your choice.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.552
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.551
Would you please
give me the gold?

04:27.920 --> 04:29.751
Good afternoon, senators.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.752
The president is very
grateful for your time here.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.877
Believe me, this is a matter
of the utmost importance.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.871
I cannot stress too much
the utmost secrecy.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.520
Why don't you just
cut out the shit, George?

04:40.600 --> 04:44.354
You're here to ask the committee
for money, so come out and ask for it.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.238
Thanks for the advice.
I am gonna ask you for money.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.311
Guess what else?
You're gonna give it to me.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.278
You all remember
Dr. Hans Kleindast...

04:52.360 --> 04:55.511
the Nobel Laureate who helped us
during the space program?

04:55.600 --> 04:57.079
For 20 years...

04:57.160 --> 05:00.311
he's been keeping his face
off of Time magazine doing research.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.755
His field of research
has been time travel.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.990
- Time travel.
- Time travel.

05:05.080 --> 05:08.356
- Well, beam me up, Scotty.
- That's very funny, Senator.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.557
- Wanna know what's funnier than that?
- He's gonna tell us.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.552
The funny thing is...
the good doctor actually did it.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.598
I thought that'd
get your attention.

05:20.680 --> 05:24.355
He did it. The technology is
in the folders in front of you.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.271
You won't understand it
any better than I can.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.670
Now, you can't go forward,
because the future hasn't happened yet.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.513
However, you can go back,
and that's where things get tricky.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.991
If you go back and change something,
it's serious. It could be catastrophic.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.275
It's like throwing
a stone in a lake...

05:39.360 --> 05:41.635
only now there
are ripples in time.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.996
So you can't go back and kill Hitler,
much as we'd like to...

05:45.080 --> 05:47.958
because it could cause
a chain reaction of events...

05:48.040 --> 05:50.600
that could alter
or even destroy mankind.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.989
And that, my good senators,
is where you come in.

05:53.080 --> 05:58.598
We have to form a new agency to police
this technology and protect time.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.956
It will be called the Time Enforcement
Commission or the T.E.C.

06:02.040 --> 06:07.068
Eugene Matuzak of the Washington P.D.
Is our choice to run the commission.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.755
- How much is this gonna cost?
- A lot.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.037
- How much is a lot?
- More than a little
and less than too much.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.430
This is not a good time
to ask for money. The economy...

06:17.520 --> 06:21.433
Suppose one of our competitors goes
back in time and invents the computer?

06:21.520 --> 06:23.351
Or the airplane or the automobile?

06:23.440 --> 06:25.476
You wanna talk about
the American economy, Senator?

06:25.560 --> 06:28.836
How about this one?
Saddam Hussein finances a trip to 1944.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.433
He gets our technology...

06:30.520 --> 06:33.239
and Iraq becomes the first country
to have the atomic bomb.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.153
- Oh, you like that one.
- Not bad.

06:36.240 --> 06:39.038
Try this one.
We think there's already been a ripple.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.749
Ten days ago, the C.I.A. Broke up
an arms sale to terrorists...

06:42.840 --> 06:44.671
in Hamburg, Germany.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.399
Ordinarily, that sort of news
doesn't cross the president's desk.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.993
What made this different...

06:49.080 --> 06:51.071
was that the purchase
was made with gold bullion...

06:51.160 --> 06:53.674
and the bullion
was dated 1863...

06:53.760 --> 06:56.593
and stamped
"Confederate States of America."

06:56.680 --> 06:59.399
We had it carbon-tested
and authenticated. It's real.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.789
Now, just think
about what I'm saying.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.077
Going back in time
is a pretty easy way to make money.

07:05.160 --> 07:09.153
Our committee would have exclusive
jurisdiction over this program?

07:09.240 --> 07:13.313
Yours and yours alone. No one can know
about this. It's too dangerous.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.789
That's very good, George.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.075
Personally...

07:18.160 --> 07:21.755
I think this sounds like that
bullshit Star Wars program.

07:21.840 --> 07:26.675
You'll get your money. Anyone here want
to chair the oversight on this program?

07:26.760 --> 07:28.512
Yeah, I'll do it.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.637
Ah, young Senator McComb.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.518
Why not?
Oh, you'll like him, George.

07:34.600 --> 07:38.912
Very much like you,
except his dorsal fin's a bit bigger.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.555
There's never enough time.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.074
Never enough for what?

08:23.160 --> 08:25.754
To satisfy a woman.

08:25.840 --> 08:29.116
Then you never want
to miss an opportunity.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.958
Are you busy?

08:32.039 --> 08:34.030
I'm meeting my husband.

08:35.159 --> 08:38.197
If I were him,
I would not keep you waiting.

08:39.080 --> 08:43.039
If he's not here when I turn around,
I'll go home with you.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.599
You'll do.

08:51.520 --> 08:52.350
Mmm.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.351
I didn't hear you
leave this morning.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.193
It was early.
I was meeting with Matuzak.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.679
Are you gonna
take that job?

09:03.120 --> 09:05.076
- What?
- Be right back.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.190
Read it.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.358
- "Wolverine"?
- Between the lines.

09:19.440 --> 09:22.273
I should get
the fuck outta here.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.191
Good.

09:24.280 --> 09:27.431
You know that purse?
Doesn't look good on you.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.071
Thank you.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.516
- Glad you're not hurt.
- Thank you.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.553
Smart kid.
He read my mind.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.471
With your English,
he doesn't have much choice.

10:00.520 --> 10:03.637
Hey, I know all the good words.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.314
You didn't answer my question.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.109
- Are you gonna take this job?
- I think so.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.509
Is this T.E.C. Thing dangerous?

10:13.600 --> 10:15.670
I don't bake cookies for a living.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.391
Will you have to travel?

10:18.480 --> 10:21.278
Not the way you think.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.352
Pictures bring back your memories.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.716
Aw, you're gonna
be very happy you have this.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.791
Why?

10:29.880 --> 10:33.111
I can see into the future.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.998
- You can see the future, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.789
- What do you see?
- I see it's gonna rain.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.474
We both have
the afternoon off.

10:42.560 --> 10:47.873
Why don't we go and practice some of
those words you seem to like so much?

11:30.120 --> 11:32.111
Max?

11:32.200 --> 11:34.555
Hmm? What?

11:37.120 --> 11:40.590
I have something I want to tell you.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.511
Shit. I'm sorry.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.070
Don't answer it.
Just this once, don't answer it.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.720
I have to.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.116
Walker.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.071
Now?

12:03.160 --> 12:05.913
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Can you find somebody else?

12:22.160 --> 12:24.799
Look, uh, somebody
called in sick and...

12:24.880 --> 12:26.836
And there's nobody
but Max Walker...

12:26.920 --> 12:29.070
- to keep the streets safe.
- I said I was sorry.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.357
- It's not like I have a choice.
- Of course you have a choice.

12:32.440 --> 12:36.433
- This is what I do.
- I know that's what you do.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.318
It's just that things
are different now.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.550
What are you
talking about?

12:41.640 --> 12:44.996
This isn't the way
I wanted to do this.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.957
I have to go.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.235
There's something
you need to tell me?

12:49.320 --> 12:51.709
Yes.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.109
Can you wait
until I get back?

12:54.200 --> 12:55.952
Sure.

13:05.080 --> 13:08.595
Surprise.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.680
Max!

13:48.280 --> 13:50.191
Melissa!

13:50.280 --> 13:52.350
Max!

13:52.440 --> 13:56.035
- Finish him.
- Who are you?

13:56.120 --> 13:59.556
You're a smart boy.
Why don't you sleep on it a while?

15:15.640 --> 15:18.757
Nothing to see over there.
It's just another jumper.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.671
Hang on, there, buddy!

15:20.760 --> 15:23.228
All right, close enough! That's it!

15:23.320 --> 15:25.550
Thank you!
Stand back, folks!

15:25.640 --> 15:28.518
Come on! Break it up!
There's nothin' to see!

15:28.600 --> 15:32.991
Go back to work. Come on!
Come on, now! Come on, now.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.071
Break it up.
Go back to work.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.720
Come on. Come on,
get out of here.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.200
- Good morning, Mr. Atwood.
- Good morning, Charlie.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.874
- It's a terrible day, sir.
- Beat it.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.155
- What's goin' on?
- Mr. Floatbauer.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.351
He went off the roof.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.871
Ah, yeah.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.157
Well, shit happens.
Excuse me.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.708
Oh, that poor man!

16:10.720 --> 16:12.551
Good morning, Pete.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.517
Good morning, Mr. Atwood.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.593
Third jumper this week. They keep
this up, you're gonna be out of a job.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.591
Only going down, sir.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.998
There he is!

16:31.080 --> 16:35.198
- Mr. Atwood, isn't it terrible?
- Tragic.

17:03.960 --> 17:07.077
...little lovebirds

17:07.160 --> 17:09.070
We're not above birds

17:09.160 --> 17:11.276
Let's misbehave

17:23.240 --> 17:25.878
Slip and slide

17:25.960 --> 17:28.473
Slip inside

17:29.520 --> 17:31.875
Slip and slide

17:43.720 --> 17:47.838
I learn to love
I learn to live

17:51.880 --> 17:52.915
Get me Ross.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.037
Ross! Hi!
Yeah, listen.

17:56.120 --> 17:59.510
I want another 100,000 shares
of Middle States Oil.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.592
No, no. Just buy it.
It's an act of faith.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.353
I really think things
are gonna turn around.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.749
I got a feeling
about the future.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.195
Look, I gotta go.
I'm... I'm very busy.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.833
- Walker.
- How've you been, Lyle?

18:36.360 --> 18:37.395
How ya doin', partner?

18:37.480 --> 18:41.439
- Ex-partner.
- Max.

18:42.520 --> 18:46.069
I'm not gonna change a thing. The only
ripples'll be in my swimming pool.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.232
It's a nice place.
You couldn't do this by yourself.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.198
- Who are you working for?
- I'm not hurtin' anybody.

18:52.280 --> 18:56.831
It's America, man! I'm just
takin' an opportunity, that's all.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.718
I've got to take you back.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.517
I went ten rounds with
John L. Sullivan himself.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.511
Oh.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.235
I saw Tyson beat Spinks on TV.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.877
- Mr. Atwood... Oh, my god!
- Get down.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.709
Doesn't look too good, Lyle.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.631
Let me go, Max.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.676
I'll stay here.
I won't go back.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.876
Who sent you?
I want the name.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.791
Like it'll make any difference.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.678
In a few weeks,
this guy's gonna run the whole country.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.797
If he doesn't get the money here,
he's gonna get it somewhere else.

20:44.880 --> 20:48.634
I can't tell you. He'll send somebody
back to wipe out my grandparents.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.994
It'll be like I never existed:

20:50.040 --> 20:53.919
My mother, my father, my wife,
my kids, my fuckin' cat!

20:54.000 --> 20:58.915
You ever hear of the name Aaron McComb?
Senator McComb?

20:59.800 --> 21:00.835
Bullshit.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.912
You don't understand.
He's gonna be president.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.798
He's doin' this to get
money for his campaign.

21:06.880 --> 21:10.634
Shit, Max, he already
owns most of the guys we work with!

21:10.720 --> 21:13.598
When we get back,
you'll point them out.

21:13.680 --> 21:17.639
You're out of your mind.
This guy's gonna roll right over you.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.029
- We'll see. Let's go.
- Listen to me!

21:20.120 --> 21:23.669
If I go back and talk,
my family is dead.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.877
I'm talkin' about my f...
my family!

21:28.600 --> 21:32.593
If I die here, it's only me.
I can't go back!

21:34.680 --> 21:39.310
I have to bring you back.
I have no choice.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.591
Neither do I.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.233
Holy Mother of Mary!

22:07.720 --> 22:10.996
Lieutenant Clapton, 0316.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.957
Lieutenant Clapton.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.196
Testify and I'll do what I can.

22:16.280 --> 22:20.432
Communication relays
rerouted to Alpha 02.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.518
Captain Lyle Atwood,
you are charged with violations...

22:28.600 --> 22:31.956
of T.E.C. Code 40.8,
subsection nine...

22:32.040 --> 22:34.634
time travel with intent
to alter the future.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.429
Charges are compounded by your current
status as a time enforcement officer.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.590
Does the defendant
have any statement?

22:40.680 --> 22:44.150
- Tell her.
- Something to say on your own behalf?

22:44.240 --> 22:47.789
- Yes.
- No.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.599
Then I will pass sentence
as mandated by our charter.

22:50.680 --> 22:53.638
Say something.
Come on. Say something!

22:53.720 --> 22:55.950
The defendant has been
found guilty...

22:56.040 --> 22:57.439
Take care of yourself, Max.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.750
And is sentenced to death,
immediately.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.431
Poor bastard.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.273
Tomorrow might've been
a brighter day.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.592
We're pickin' up
some noise outside Camp David, '79.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.478
Intelligence thinks
it's a kill team out of Iran.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.391
It's their third
try this year.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.311
C.I.A.'s trying to locate
their launch facility.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.233
I want two teams on this date.
Let's smoke these guys.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.914
- Right.
- Number two: Los Angeles, 1902.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.630
Somebody's trying to get a jump on
real-estate, buying up Beverly Hills.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.551
- Burr and Swain got the deal.
- Yes, sir.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.392
You look like shit.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.311
- We have to talk.
- In a minute.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.550
- Now.
- I said in a minute.

23:47.640 --> 23:52.031
Temporary wave guide
shutdown in three minutes.

23:53.640 --> 23:57.394
Shit. Go over your dispatch notes
and check with me before you launch.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.630
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- George. Welcome.

23:59.720 --> 24:03.713
Gene. Senator Nelson, this is
T.E.C. Director Matuzak.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.837
Senator Nelson is the newest member
of the oversight committee.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.911
Since he's gonna be voting
on your budget...

24:09.000 --> 24:10.592
he'd like to see how it's spent.

24:10.680 --> 24:14.116
Senator McComb,
our long-standing committee chairman...

24:14.200 --> 24:18.034
agreed to take time out from his
presidential campaign to accompany us.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.951
Senator.

24:20.040 --> 24:22.349
Well. Be a pleasure
to show you around.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.749
Are these all of your agents?

24:24.840 --> 24:27.752
Most of 'em. Agent Monroe.
Agent Anderson.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.354
Agents Burr, Bartolo and Shepherd.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.398
- Agent Walker.
- Agent Walker.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.671
I've heard a great deal about you.

24:36.760 --> 24:40.673
- And I've heard a lot about you.
- Not all of it bad, I hope.

24:42.320 --> 24:45.278
Agent Walker just returned
from a successful mission.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.909
Well, congratulations,
Agent Walker.

24:50.800 --> 24:54.793
Senator, now Director Matuzak
will show you the launch room.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.235
Follow me.
I'll show you where we kick off.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.675
You wouldn't mind
if Agent Walker accompanied us?

24:59.760 --> 25:02.877
I'd love to hear about
his most recent mission.

25:02.960 --> 25:07.351
- I have a report to file.
- Agent Walker would be delighted.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.398
All units switch to TEC channel three.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.472
All units switch
to TEC channel three.

25:13.560 --> 25:15.710
As you can see,
we've spared every expense.

25:15.800 --> 25:19.554
No comfort, no convenience,
no necessities. Watch your head.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.835
So, Agent Walker,
who were you after?

25:21.920 --> 25:24.514
A man named Atwood.
Ring a bell?

25:24.600 --> 25:28.070
Atwood. No.
Should that name be familiar to me?

25:28.160 --> 25:32.199
- Unfortunately, Atwood was a TEC agent.
- Really?

25:32.280 --> 25:35.078
See, George, I don't
want to sound like a broken record...

25:35.160 --> 25:37.958
but that's one of the dangers
of having an agency like this.

25:38.040 --> 25:42.113
- Imagine the dangers of not having it.
- Did you know this Atwood?

25:42.200 --> 25:44.031
He was my partner.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.829
Oh, I'm sorry.
Nothing worse than a rogue cop.

25:47.920 --> 25:51.310
- Except the guy who paid him.
- If there is such a guy.

25:51.400 --> 25:55.154
- There always is.
- Do you know who the man is?

25:55.240 --> 25:58.391
- Oh, yeah.
- Why don't you arrest him?

25:58.480 --> 26:01.313
- I lost my witness.
- Oh.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.152
Well, I trust you'll
keep working on it.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.913
You can bet on it.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.475
Hydrogen specialists,
prepare for inspection.

26:15.600 --> 26:19.070
We've updated our entire operation
to Parker Datalink Systems...

26:19.160 --> 26:21.196
utilizing their
superconducting chip.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.475
Senator McComb
was Jack Parker's partner...

26:23.560 --> 26:27.314
and sold out before the company
got the patent on that chip.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.960
- Bet that cost you a few billion.
- Whoa, bad luck.

26:31.240 --> 26:34.630
My deal with Jack Parker
is not important, Mr. Spota.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.712
What is important is talking about
the dangers of this program.

26:37.800 --> 26:41.076
- You got my vote.
- Excuse me. What dangers?

26:41.160 --> 26:43.549
Well, dishonest agents
like this, uh, Atwood.

26:43.640 --> 26:48.031
Every time an agent goes back,
he risks making contact with
the past version of himself.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.759
- That could be a disaster.
- And why is that?

26:50.840 --> 26:54.515
The same matter can't occupy
the same space at the same time.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.830
It's never happened.

26:56.920 --> 26:58.672
Not yet, but what I propose...

26:58.760 --> 27:00.830
is far less costly
yet accomplishes the same thing.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.797
Why don't we just
prevent time travel...

27:02.880 --> 27:05.792
rather than spend money
trying to police it?

27:05.880 --> 27:07.836
I have to get back
to the Hill.

27:07.920 --> 27:12.630
Malcolm, this is a project
that we could do without.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.836
I hope you vote against
continued appropriations.

27:15.520 --> 27:17.636
I admire your dedication,
Agent Walker.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.038
I hope you keep trying
to get your man.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.678
I never quit.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.632
We've done a breakdown
of the latest poll results.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.354
While the trends
are not what we want...

27:36.440 --> 27:38.590
there are some good things
we can utilize.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.955
The numbers in the suburbs
are encouraging...

27:41.040 --> 27:43.156
but they are killing you
in the urban centers.

27:43.240 --> 27:47.279
But you're gaining with the pro-life,
pro-death-penalty coalition...

27:47.360 --> 27:50.511
and with the close-our-border,
anti-immigration faction.

27:50.600 --> 27:55.071
The bad news is the campaign chairman
put together a projected budget...

27:55.160 --> 27:58.277
from now to Election Day,
and it's a big number.

27:58.360 --> 28:02.990
Even going back again, I don't see how
you could get it all in time.

28:06.360 --> 28:09.432
Lawrence, I love you.
I really do.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.715
But don't tell me
what I can't do.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.394
Elections are won with television.

28:14.480 --> 28:17.631
You don't need the press, endorsements.
You don't even need the truth.

28:17.720 --> 28:18.436
You need money.

28:19.720 --> 28:21.676
So... tell me.

28:21.760 --> 28:26.117
How much is it gonna cost
to buy the network time I need?

28:26.200 --> 28:28.509
- $50 million.
- $50 million.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.591
Agent Walker has already
cost me that much.

28:30.680 --> 28:34.673
We're gonna chat with him, the kind
of chat a man remembers for a lifetime.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.799
Sure is a handsome devil, isn't he?

28:49.880 --> 28:53.270
- He's not my type.
- What did you want to talk about?

28:53.360 --> 28:55.635
What do you know
about him?

28:55.720 --> 28:57.950
Capable of eating
his young.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.508
He sure seemed interested
in you this afternoon.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.477
He interests me.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.437
Atwood named him.

29:04.520 --> 29:08.354
- You're shittin' me.
- He's the one who sent him back.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.876
- Why didn't he testify?
- McComb would go after his family.

29:11.960 --> 29:15.475
He also said McComb
has half of the agency. I believe him.

29:15.560 --> 29:18.358
He doesn't have me.

29:18.440 --> 29:21.318
I said, he doesn't have me.

29:21.400 --> 29:24.233
- Well, fuck you too.
- He's gonna close the agency.

29:24.320 --> 29:27.630
Then no one can stop him
from going back.

29:27.720 --> 29:30.280
- This one is mine.
- Not unless I say it is.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.999
The son of a bitch
is a presidential candidate.

29:33.080 --> 29:37.073
If you haul him in, you better have
enough evidence to plug up the Potomac.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.037
- You believe me.
- I always believe you...

29:39.120 --> 29:41.714
but you're not always right.

29:41.800 --> 29:44.917
Yeah.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.918
Come over to the house for dinner.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.956
Carol would love to see you.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.429
Thanks. Some other time.

29:53.520 --> 29:56.796
You're allowed to have a life.
I read it in a manual.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.156
I'll tell you this:
If I cannot go back to save her...

30:00.240 --> 30:03.516
this scumbag is not
going back to steal money.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.471
Go home, Max.

30:07.560 --> 30:11.678
If you won't come to mine,
go to yours.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.238
By the way, when I said
McComb hasn't bought me...

30:19.320 --> 30:22.357
you were supposed to say,
"I know that."

30:24.560 --> 30:26.391
I know that.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.155
System initialized.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.629
Destination, please.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.915
Home.

31:35.040 --> 31:38.316
There are no new messages.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.914
Television.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.314
Play tape.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.551
It's going to look like
this when I'm finished.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.029
See? Very nice.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.716
"Victorian Villa Deluxe Birdhouse."

32:05.720 --> 32:10.236
This thing is gonna be bigger
than our house by the time I'm done.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.196
Okay. Uh-huh.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.999
- Want some help?
- Want some help?

32:17.080 --> 32:18.911
Yeah. You can buy the birdseed.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.798
Okay. Divide all these parts...

32:21.880 --> 32:25.156
into groups to determine
their structural function.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.549
- I should buy more videotapes.
- I should buy more videotapes.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.471
Gotta be in the mood to do this.

32:29.560 --> 32:32.711
- You were a second ago.
- You were a second ago.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.677
I think that I should...

32:34.760 --> 32:37.752
start with something
easier to put together.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.115
Huh? Honey?

32:44.200 --> 32:47.988
Maybe you should lay out
all the parts first, then...

32:48.080 --> 32:51.231
- You know...
- I think I wanna try from memory.

32:51.320 --> 32:54.039
Just find part "A"
and work from there.

32:57.440 --> 32:58.998
The controversy...

32:59.080 --> 33:02.834
over government-provided campaign funds
is in the news again.

33:02.920 --> 33:06.196
The White Supremacist Party has
qualified for matching funds...

33:06.280 --> 33:10.114
sparking many groups to petition
for the abolition of the practice.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.998
Meanwhile, Senator McComb's
fading presidential bid...

33:13.080 --> 33:14.479
received another blow...

33:14.560 --> 33:17.358
when today it was denied
federal campaign matching funds.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.398
Sources indicate
the senator is out of money...

33:20.480 --> 33:23.472
and may be forced
to withdraw from the race.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.869
Though no official
statement has been made...

33:25.960 --> 33:29.714
independent party leaders claim that
the denial will bolster their play...

33:29.800 --> 33:31.631
for the upcoming
presidential election.

33:31.720 --> 33:34.757
With the polls showing
independent candidate Elgin Michaels...

33:34.840 --> 33:36.671
trailing the incumbent
by only six points...

33:36.760 --> 33:39.991
There are no new messages.

35:03.280 --> 35:07.831
Who are you?
Who sent you?

35:07.920 --> 35:10.195
Who sent you?

35:26.840 --> 35:29.229
Fifty thousand volts, motherfucker.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.151
Have a nice day.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.311
Walker?

35:52.440 --> 35:54.829
Walker!

35:56.120 --> 35:59.157
My name's Fielding.
I'm with Internal Affairs.

36:00.360 --> 36:03.955
He messed up my apartment.
You can kill him.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.552
You've got some more inside.

36:08.640 --> 36:12.315
- Everybody freeze!
- I'm a cop! I'm a cop!

36:12.400 --> 36:14.356
I.D.
I.D.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.317
Get in there.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.436
You, he's under arrest.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.351
They're all under arrest.

36:20.440 --> 36:24.991
Assault, attempted murder,
makin' a mess.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.196
Sector 17, Sector 19.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.350
Report for duty
in five minutes.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.151
If you'd like,
I'll have the door removed.

36:43.240 --> 36:45.071
I had company
this morning.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.720
- You look like they stayed awhile.
- McComb sent them.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.075
- Did they say that?
- I said that.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.833
- And what does I.A. Want?
- Atwood was your partner.

36:52.920 --> 36:56.435
Internal Affairs isn't convinced
you can be trusted anymore.

36:59.440 --> 37:03.513
- She's not going to follow me.
- We've got a phase four. You take it.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.034
Send somebody else.
I want to be where McComb is.

37:06.120 --> 37:10.432
A little refresher course in Agency
etiquette: I'm the director, I direct.

37:10.520 --> 37:14.513
I authorize the missions. I make
the assignments. This one's yours.

37:14.600 --> 37:18.752
This agency isn't dead yet, but if I
can't keep you from McComb, it will be!

37:18.840 --> 37:21.798
- Fielding, get in here!
- She'll get in my way.

37:21.880 --> 37:24.838
Ask her to stay behind you.
You've got an hour until launch.

37:24.920 --> 37:27.673
- You're not funny.
- I'm never funny.

37:28.960 --> 37:29.949
Yeah?

37:30.040 --> 37:32.349
Disturbance has jumped
from four to six, sir.

37:35.840 --> 37:39.799
Yes.

37:47.440 --> 37:49.749
Yes.

37:52.680 --> 37:55.956
I catch you fuckin' this machine again,
I'll break your neck.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.679
- Sorry, Chief.
- Looks like safe sex to me.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.796
- Show me.
- Okay.

38:00.880 --> 38:05.954
Here we go. The ripple was steady
at four, then spiked past five to six.

38:06.040 --> 38:08.600
On the board, it looks
like it set off Waimea.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.989
Somebody's really doing a number.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.435
We've located the point
of origin and...

38:13.520 --> 38:16.318
- it's right here in Washington.
- Shit.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.868
Come on.
You're out of here.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.030
You should have an exhibit.

38:21.120 --> 38:25.796
Oh, really? All my best stuff's
at home.

38:25.880 --> 38:29.190
I really could care less
whether you like me or not...

38:29.280 --> 38:31.111
but you don't know
a thing about me.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.714
T minus three minutes and counting.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.631
I've been with I.A. For two years.

38:35.720 --> 38:40.396
I'm field-rated in weapons and tactics
and speak three languages. Impressed?

38:40.480 --> 38:43.711
- I'm blown away.
- I read the Atwood file.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.711
You didn't mention you could read.

38:45.800 --> 38:49.076
He was your friend,
and you still asked to go after him.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.118
- He crossed the line.
- Or he crossed you.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.637
Launch sequence activated.

38:56.720 --> 39:00.269
Authorized personnel only in the area.

39:00.360 --> 39:03.352
She looks just like the Vollmers!

39:03.440 --> 39:05.556
T minus two minutes and counting.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.471
Why is everyone so nervous?

39:07.560 --> 39:11.519
When a launch goes wrong,
they're the guys who scrape the wall.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.637
And you do look like
the Vollmer twins.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.711
Who are the Vollmer twins?

39:19.600 --> 39:22.114
Launch personnel only in the bay.

39:32.120 --> 39:35.192
T minus one minute 30 seconds
and counting.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.954
Magnetic field polarity
initiation in ten seconds.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.070
Telemetry check is initiated.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.715
Are we gonna blast to the past!

39:59.800 --> 40:02.917
Yee-hah!

40:08.360 --> 40:10.316
Green for launch!

40:16.680 --> 40:18.671
I've run dozens
of simulated launches...

40:18.760 --> 40:20.830
but I-I never noticed
that wall before.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.559
- "Simulated"?
- This is my first real launch.

40:23.640 --> 40:26.757
Great. Don't stick
your head out of the window.

40:26.840 --> 40:30.116
- She's a little shaky.
- Blood pressure'll loosen her teeth.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.957
Her pulse is pushing 140.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.076
If she farts, she'll get
ahead of the pod.

40:34.160 --> 40:37.596
Fielding, listen to me.
It helps to concentrate...

40:37.680 --> 40:40.752
on something relaxing
during a launch.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.230
What do you think about?

40:48.280 --> 40:50.555
Not swallowing my tongue.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.758
- How's Walker?
- You'd have to shake him...

40:53.840 --> 40:55.193
to be sure he's awake.

40:55.280 --> 40:58.670
- He's awake.
- T minus 30 seconds.

40:58.760 --> 41:02.230
29... 28... 27... 26...

41:02.320 --> 41:07.235
25... 24... 23...
22... 21... 20...

41:07.320 --> 41:10.596
- Have they ever lost a pod?
- Ask the Vollmers.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.478
- Where are they?
- See those two red spots?

41:13.560 --> 41:16.120
12... 11... 10...

41:16.200 --> 41:18.589
- Oh, God.
- Nine... eight... seven...

41:18.680 --> 41:21.069
Six... five... four...

41:21.160 --> 41:24.311
Three... two... one...

41:24.400 --> 41:26.755
Zero.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.630
They're away.

41:58.720 --> 42:01.757
Is this the hottest thing or what?

42:11.960 --> 42:14.110
Goddamn Ricky.

42:16.840 --> 42:18.671
So much for a dry run.

42:18.760 --> 42:20.830
We're alive.

42:20.920 --> 42:24.959
- Are we where we're supposed to be?
- Give me a date.

42:25.040 --> 42:28.350
Sunday, October 9, 1994.

42:28.440 --> 42:32.035
Target.

42:32.120 --> 42:35.396
- We're close.
- October 9?

42:35.480 --> 42:37.311
- I'll be 16 tomorrow.
- Where?

42:37.400 --> 42:41.837
I was living in Colorado.
Man, this is weird. Whew.

42:41.920 --> 42:45.959
Yeah? Well, don't get sentimental
and try to visit yourself.

42:46.040 --> 42:49.828
I'd like to call myself, tell me not to
sleep with Bobby Morgan after my party.

42:49.920 --> 42:52.753
It's really disappointing.

42:52.840 --> 42:55.070
A smart woman
would call Bobby...

42:55.160 --> 42:57.469
and give him
some advice.

42:57.560 --> 42:59.949
Aw, yeah, right.

43:05.400 --> 43:09.075
- How long was Atwood your partner?
- Three years.

43:09.160 --> 43:13.790
- Was it difficult to bring him back?
- What do you think?

43:15.080 --> 43:17.799
You got a family?
Hmm?

43:17.880 --> 43:20.348
Mine's still in Colorado.

43:20.440 --> 43:22.635
When my dad started
reading about time travel...

43:22.720 --> 43:25.757
he said it was a bigger threat
to the world than the nuclear bomb.

43:25.840 --> 43:28.035
He's right.

43:28.120 --> 43:29.951
That's why I joined the agency.

43:30.040 --> 43:32.952
The world should be able to party
on Saturday night...

43:33.040 --> 43:35.838
and not worry whether the planet's
going to be here on Monday.

43:35.920 --> 43:39.674
- You sound like a woman I knew.
- Someone remarkable, I hope.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.591
- Yeah.

43:41.680 --> 43:44.956
Someone you knew, huh?
So, where is she?

43:45.040 --> 43:46.871
She was killed.

43:46.960 --> 43:48.791
Sorry.

43:48.880 --> 43:52.350
You must've thought
about going back and changing that.

43:54.920 --> 43:56.114
We're here.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.797
Huh.

44:12.440 --> 44:15.273
I thought it was
just Parker Datalink.

44:16.280 --> 44:19.636
Take the back
and wait for my call.

44:19.720 --> 44:22.518
Keep your head down.
Tomorrow's your birthday.

44:44.120 --> 44:46.680
- I have a problem.
- You do?

44:46.760 --> 44:49.558
Yes. Let me tell you
what my problem is.

44:49.640 --> 44:52.438
This isn't working.
I can't keep paying for this.

44:52.520 --> 44:56.513
- Hey, it doesn't matter to me.
- Oh, but it should, Jack.

44:56.600 --> 44:59.398
You're taking the goddamn company
into bankruptcy.

44:59.480 --> 45:01.311
We have a difference of opinion.

45:01.400 --> 45:03.960
The chip is the future of this company.

45:04.040 --> 45:08.192
- Since you don't agree, walk away.
- This isn't the first time
we've had this conversation.

45:08.280 --> 45:10.840
Come up with money
and I'm out of here.

45:10.920 --> 45:13.115
You know I can't afford it...

45:13.200 --> 45:17.955
but I've found an enterprising
banker with faith in the future.

45:18.040 --> 45:20.838
Take it.

45:20.920 --> 45:24.037
You're out.
You've got no faith in the company...

45:24.120 --> 45:26.429
and I've got none in politicians.

45:39.640 --> 45:43.952
If I were you,
I wouldn't cash that check.

45:44.040 --> 45:47.237
It's gonna cost you
more than you'll ever know.

45:49.240 --> 45:52.152
Hey, Jack, it's been a while.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.993
- What is this?
- It's me.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.878
Well, it's, it's him.

46:00.400 --> 46:02.277
No, it's us.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.351
W-W-Where did you come from?

46:04.440 --> 46:08.479
- Are you his father?
- Do I look that old?

46:08.560 --> 46:13.315
I'm a United States senator.
Hurting me is a federal offense.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.789
- I don't know about Jack's business.
- Will you stop it?

46:15.880 --> 46:19.395
J-Just stop it.
Get a grip.

46:19.480 --> 46:22.517
I remember having bigger balls.

46:25.720 --> 46:28.518
I'm gonna have to get
this fixed. Right...

46:28.600 --> 46:30.909
Don't touch me.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.515
Same matter can't occupy
the same space.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.909
Same matter?

46:37.000 --> 46:41.198
So, you got
a special N.S.A. Briefing coming up.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.396
Secret session.

46:43.480 --> 46:45.471
That's not for another week.

46:45.560 --> 46:50.998
Time travel, someone says,
gets a big laugh.

46:51.080 --> 46:54.117
Oh, Christ, you're me.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.919
How far back have you come?

47:07.000 --> 47:09.798
Never interrupt me
when I'm talking to myself.

47:09.880 --> 47:12.997
- We're gonna take them.
- What's the signal?

47:16.560 --> 47:19.552
You were a visionary.
The computer market was saturated.

47:19.640 --> 47:21.631
The software stocks
were in the toilet...

47:21.720 --> 47:25.110
and your fuckin' coldware
revolutionizes the industry.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.395
I made a mistake.

47:27.480 --> 47:30.552
- I came to tell you I changed my mind.
- Now.

47:34.200 --> 47:37.237
Freeze!

47:37.320 --> 47:41.916
Do you realize how inappropriate
that word is? Do I look frozen to you?

47:42.000 --> 47:44.434
You look like shit to me.
Get away from him!

47:45.880 --> 47:48.155
Move!

47:48.240 --> 47:50.993
Drop the guns, now.

47:53.720 --> 47:56.632
Under your jacket there's
a track-and-return module.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.233
Throw it to me.

48:01.880 --> 48:04.030
You, uh, gonna
leave me back here?

48:04.120 --> 48:07.749
Do it.

48:11.000 --> 48:15.471
Agent Walker, I wanna see how you get
down here and keep the gun on us.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.516
What are you gonna do?
You gonna jump?

48:17.600 --> 48:19.989
That's how the Vollmers
would do it.

48:32.440 --> 48:34.271
Move back.

48:34.360 --> 48:37.193
Give me the envelope.

48:37.280 --> 48:39.157
Thank you.

48:39.240 --> 48:42.516
The country's going down the drain
because of the special interests.

48:42.600 --> 48:46.354
We need someone rich in the White House
who doesn't have to listen to anybody.

48:46.440 --> 48:49.637
- What's that?
- The senator was having a fund-raiser.

48:49.720 --> 48:52.029
When I'm in office,
it's gonna be like the '80s.

48:52.120 --> 48:56.989
Top 10% will get richer, the rest can
emigrate to Mexico, live a better life.

48:57.080 --> 48:59.230
So, you goin' or stayin'?

48:59.320 --> 49:01.880
I think you plan too far ahead.

49:03.160 --> 49:05.071
Obviously, you don't.

49:08.760 --> 49:12.275
Anything else you want
to tell me about yourself?

49:14.320 --> 49:16.834
Don't tell anyone I killed ya.
I'm out on bail.

49:16.920 --> 49:20.435
Okay, let's finish up
and get out of here.

49:20.520 --> 49:22.909
He's running for president.
I'm voting early.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.117
Good seeing you again, Jack.

49:28.040 --> 49:31.396
Maybe he'll calm down
after the election.

49:31.480 --> 49:34.278
What's the big deal?

49:34.360 --> 49:36.669
Point it, pull the trigger...

49:36.760 --> 49:38.910
and, boom, somebody dies.

49:49.280 --> 49:51.191
Get up there!
Get the module!

50:12.880 --> 50:15.189
Fuckin' great!
Will you get him?

50:15.280 --> 50:16.395
Goddamn it.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.075
Oh!

51:46.520 --> 51:49.432
Aaron!

51:50.640 --> 51:52.471
Come here.

51:54.640 --> 51:56.551
You own the company,
do you understand?

51:56.640 --> 52:00.474
The chip is going to be worth billions,
my billions.

52:00.560 --> 52:03.393
Now, read this.

52:03.480 --> 52:06.278
You just read it
and do what it says.

52:06.360 --> 52:08.191
Now, you get out of here.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.509
Oh. And will you do me a favor?

52:12.600 --> 52:15.637
Will you lay off
the fuckin' candy bars?

53:24.760 --> 53:27.069
Have a nice day.

53:54.040 --> 53:57.794
- I should've said, "Freeze."
- I think he got the idea.

53:57.880 --> 54:01.077
Do me a favor.
Don't give up without a fight.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.878
Never crossed my mind.

54:05.160 --> 54:07.879
I don't want
to fight a woman.

54:07.960 --> 54:10.838
Then don't.

54:17.840 --> 54:19.671
Changed my mind.

54:22.520 --> 54:24.795
Tell me he's gonna
kill your family.

54:26.440 --> 54:30.194
- Don't you leave me, damn it!
- Who are you talking to?

54:40.000 --> 54:42.195
Stay here, Walker.

54:42.280 --> 54:44.794
In my future, you're dead.

55:08.560 --> 55:10.790
Look at this!

55:12.440 --> 55:14.954
Let's get a canine unit
up there.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.998
- What the hell's going on here?
- You're lucky you got back.

55:37.080 --> 55:39.878
They're gettin' ready
to tear up these tracks.

55:39.960 --> 55:42.269
- McComb?
- Who else?

55:42.360 --> 55:44.715
- He hasn't got the power.
- Are you kiddin'?

55:44.800 --> 55:48.918
He's ahead in the polls. He's probably
out buying running shoes for his team.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.835
Senate committee caved in. They want
to be on the good side of the new boss.

55:55.280 --> 55:58.795
What's the matter?
It's been headed this way for months.

55:58.880 --> 56:00.711
When I left,
nothing had happened.

56:00.800 --> 56:04.031
Hey, Walker, when they tear up the
launcher, you get the pod as a memento.

56:04.120 --> 56:05.951
He's changed the future.

56:06.040 --> 56:07.871
What are you talking about?

56:07.960 --> 56:11.748
McComb.
He's buying the presidency.

56:11.840 --> 56:14.673
What's new?
It's been done before.

56:14.760 --> 56:16.591
- The guy is a killer.
- Doesn't surprise me.

56:16.680 --> 56:18.750
- He killed my agency.
- He shot two people.

56:18.840 --> 56:23.152
- Who?
- Who? A guy named Parker and Fielding.

56:24.320 --> 56:26.470
- Do I know them?
- Fielding was with me.

56:26.560 --> 56:29.358
- You sent her.
- I don't like this guy one bit...

56:29.440 --> 56:34.798
but just who can I sell this story to
without 50 eyewitnesses?

56:35.800 --> 56:37.950
- How about one?
- You don't count.

56:38.040 --> 56:40.793
There's a chance she's still alive.

56:40.880 --> 56:43.519
- Who?
- Fielding. The cops were there.

56:43.600 --> 56:45.511
I'm gonna be looking
for a new government job.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.511
I don't think it will
help my chances...

56:47.600 --> 56:50.239
if I'm the guy that tried to put
our next president in jail.

56:50.320 --> 56:53.357
- You think I'm making this up?
- Forget it! You're not going back!

56:53.440 --> 56:55.590
If she's alive, we've got him.

56:55.680 --> 56:57.511
You understand that?
We've got the guy.

56:57.600 --> 57:00.068
We're shut down.
Take a look around. We're history.

57:00.160 --> 57:02.435
Wait, I'm gonna
show you something.

57:02.520 --> 57:05.830
You come with me.

57:05.920 --> 57:08.957
Those files are supposed to be sealed.
I don't know why I'm doing this.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.031
You say you were my best friend?

57:11.120 --> 57:14.157
- For a long time.
- I liked you?

57:14.240 --> 57:18.119
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you looking for?

57:18.200 --> 57:22.113
Fielding's friends or family;
anyone she would go to in 1994.

57:22.200 --> 57:25.590
- Who was she?
- I.A., but she had a deal with McComb.

57:25.680 --> 57:28.911
He's got to go back
to be sure she's dead.

57:30.520 --> 57:33.193
Since you say
we were close friends...

57:33.280 --> 57:36.477
I'm gonna ask you a question
the prison psychiatrist will ask you.

57:36.560 --> 57:38.551
How's our leading
presidential candidate...

57:38.640 --> 57:42.235
making these expeditions into the past
without our equipment, old pal?

57:42.320 --> 57:46.552
The prototype was never dismantled.

57:46.640 --> 57:50.633
Kleindast's.
It's in Calverton, Maryland.

57:51.800 --> 57:54.234
Short drive from Washington.

57:54.320 --> 57:57.756
We have no authority
to get in there.

57:57.840 --> 58:00.229
What about Ricky?

58:02.360 --> 58:05.750
If you were my best friend,
you wouldn't do this to me.

58:08.400 --> 58:10.516
I would have had him killed
right here, but if he's back...

58:10.600 --> 58:14.388
he's already told the story to Matuzak.
God knows who else.

58:14.480 --> 58:18.314
They won't get it, but they'll sure
give it thought if he comes up dead.

58:18.400 --> 58:21.198
- Right.
- He'll have to be erased.

58:21.280 --> 58:22.269
Erased.

58:22.360 --> 58:25.989
Have him killed
before he joined T.E.C.

58:26.080 --> 58:28.753
That way nobody in the Agency
ever talked to him or even knew him.

58:28.840 --> 58:33.356
- Perfect.
- It's not perfect. It's all we've got.

58:33.440 --> 58:35.271
Don't expect to be
my chief of staff...

58:35.360 --> 58:37.191
if slamming you
into the side of the car...

58:37.280 --> 58:39.316
turns you into a sniveling worm.

58:44.360 --> 58:46.191
Well, what do you know?

58:46.280 --> 58:50.034
At random intervals, Maryland Utilities
shows spikes in demand and duration...

58:50.120 --> 58:53.078
- that are almost identical to ours.
- Send me back.

58:53.160 --> 58:55.628
- No, they won't let us do that.
- Stay out of it, Ricky.

58:55.720 --> 58:57.711
Would it be too much trouble
to call me Richard?

58:57.800 --> 59:00.598
Richard, do I have
a best friend around here?

59:00.680 --> 59:03.592
It isn't me.
Maybe Gordon.

59:03.680 --> 59:05.636
Gordon is a putz. I can tell you
who my best friend was...

59:05.720 --> 59:07.551
in school, in the marines,
when I was a cop.

59:07.640 --> 59:09.471
Gordon doesn't fit.
I'm not saying you do...

59:09.560 --> 59:11.869
but since I'd like to see McComb take a
fall, you get the benefit of the doubt.

59:11.960 --> 59:14.758
- Whoa! Where you goin'?
- We've got to vent the fuel shunts.

59:14.840 --> 59:17.513
Oh, is that right? You'll have
to wait while I get authori...

59:22.320 --> 59:24.709
Was I your only friend?

59:28.280 --> 59:30.919
A launch is not
a one-man operation.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.831
Yeah, I know.

59:32.920 --> 59:35.878
If I'm off on velocity or trajectory,
you're gonna be an omelette.

59:35.960 --> 59:37.916
- You trying to scare me?
- Yeah.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.629
- Just hit the right year.
- I'll see ya.

59:41.720 --> 59:45.838
I've had your wife's goulash
a hundred times; always too much salt.

59:52.120 --> 59:53.997
Here goes the pension.

59:56.600 --> 59:58.875
Emergency launch system
on-line warning.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.475
Emergency launch system
on-line warning.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.749
Manual launch
initiation alert.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.071
Manual launch
initiation alert.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.274
Shut it down! Now!

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.797
Telemetry on-line.
Ignition firing on-line.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.678
- Launch now on hold for...
- Last chance!

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.637
Launch is now...

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.991
- Launch now on hold...

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.991
Damn it!

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.077
Get me the police mainframe computer.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.153
I want all Jane Does admitted
to local hospitals on October 9.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.870
Check if any of the Jane Does
are victims of multiple gunshot wounds.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.831
Gotcha.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:43.432
Dr. Lemon, call line one-five.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.318
Dr. Lemon, call line one-five.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.315
Police. Jane Doe.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.032
Happy birthday.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.637
Thanks.
Get me anything?

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.518
- Tell me what you want.
- I want to go home.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.036
I already know who's gonna
win the next ten World Series.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:27.033
- No problem.
- Why'd you come back?

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.759
I need you to testify
against McComb.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.072
Mmm.
That would be my pleasure.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.390
- It could be dangerous.
- I know that.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.869
It's not that simple.
McComb has made some changes.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.192
- You were never in the T.E.C.
- No, that can't be.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.510
I had the training for six years.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.670
- I have friends.
- I've got to move fast.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.355
If I can find you, so can he.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.431
What can I do?

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.910
I need proof
that you existed here.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.959
In case I don't
make the trip, huh?

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.315
They just took some blood.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.311
It would be in the lab.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.710
- I'll be right back.
- Hey.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.630
- I really screwed up.
- Yes, you did.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.790
I want to make things right.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.354
You may find you can make
things right for yourself.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.354
I'll be right back.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.956
Wheelchair to Admitting,
please. Wheelchair to Admitting.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.278
Dr. Ryan,
report to Obstetrics.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.318
Dr. Ryan,
report to Obstetrics.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:43.148
Nurse Remington,
report to main desk.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.198
Nurse Remington,
report to the main desk.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.197
Melissa.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.396
I'm gonna take you
to someplace safe.

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:52.399
What are you doing?

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.708
Help! Security!

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.435
Help! Security!
Somebody call security!

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.469
Help!

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.748
Security!
Call security!

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.593
Hey! Hold it!
Don't move!

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.716
Pictures bring back
your memories.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.159
- This is for what you're going to do.
- Hey, wha...

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.755
- What the...

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.078
- Melissa... don't turn around.
- Why? What's wrong?

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.151
It's okay.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.198
- Listen. Listen.
- Who are you?

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.397
It's me. Look.
It's Max.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.119
Max? Max, what happened?

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.317
I can't tell you right now.
We have to go.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.311
Trust me.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.436
Trust me.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.277
Come on.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.631
Let's go.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.640
Here! Here!

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:21.235
Please! Just tell me
what happened to you!

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.352
Just try to believe me.
I love you.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.510
Trust me.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.917
- You're not Max.
- It's me.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.877
Ten years from now,
it's me.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.916
- That's not possible.
- Remember:

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.596
- Matuzak, the new job, time travel.
- Time travel?

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:11.037
If one day I need a birdhouse built,
I know who to talk to.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.476
- Oh, my god.
- It's me. It's Max.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.951
- I can't believe this.
- Try.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.990
What am I like
ten years from now?

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.877
Just like now.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.917
Perfect.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.518
You time traveled,
and what? Why?

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.353
Let me show you.

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:54.948
Today you have something
very special to tell him.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.709
- How do you know that?
- I've just told you.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.154
What are you here to prevent?

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.037
Changes in the past.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.554
Why? What's gonna happen?

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.076
Later. Stay and meet with him.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.151
Don't tell him
anything, please.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.716
There's never enough time.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.629
Never enough for what?

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.518
To satisfy a woman.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.068
Then you never want
to miss an opportunity.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:18.197
- Are you busy?
- I'm meeting my husband.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.550
Senator McComb!
Sir!

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.349
That message came
from the senate operator, sir.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.876
- It's 3:30. You have a 4:00 with...
- Clear my schedule.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.918
- All of it.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.754
Kelly, have you ever been
inside the president's limo?

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.671
No, sir.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.910
You keep in touch.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.991
I'll send you a photograph of it.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.072
I have something I want to tell you.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.958
- Oh, shit.
- Don't answer it.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:17.431
I have to.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.829
- Did not tell him?
- He didn't give me a chance.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.674
You should have tried.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.710
Are we still together
in ten years?

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.360
Yes, we're together.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.513
- Do you have a picture?
- No, nothing recent.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.752
- Am I dead?
- No. You're not dead.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.751
What about tomorrow?

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.479
Everything is going
to be fine, okay?

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.792
Why can't we just get out? Why can't we
just run away from whatever it is?

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.838
It would come back
as many times as it takes.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.797
It has to end tonight.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.593
Hurry!
Keep him upstairs.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.638
Whatever you do,
keep him upstairs.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.871
Just do what I say.
Please! Go!

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.034
Max, I don't want you to go.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.554
I'll be back soon.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.950
I... I'm pregnant.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.669
- Great.
- I love you.

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.549
- Surprise.
- Who the fuck are you?

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.598
Friend of the family.

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.079
Don't go down!

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.518
Upstairs.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.397
- How did you miss him?
- He knew it was comin'.

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.072
It was a T.E.C. Cop.

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.196
Son of a bitch
doesn't know how to die.

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.679
He'll learn tonight.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.228
You don't kill him,
you don't go back.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.431
Upstairs.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.716
Max.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:23.040
Oh, my god, Max.
Look out!

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:03.437
You have nothing soft
to land on, do you?

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.109
Go! Go!

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.111
- I'll get help!
- Go!

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.431
Say, "Ah."

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.393
Oh, shit.

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.193
Boy, that's gotta hurt.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.837
Lousy night to be out.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.275
Don't hurt her.

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.750
You were at a disadvantage
in this from the beginning.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.070
I'm an ambitious
Harvard-educated visionary...

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.549
who deserves to be
the most powerful man in the world...

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.791
and you, you're a fuckin' idiot
who never figured out...

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:29.429
that the only way to make anything of
all that fancy kicking is on Broadway.

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.158
Thanks for clearing that up.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.117
The polls have me winning
by 28 points.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.839
That's the biggest landslide
since Nixon back in '72.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.879
I find it reassuring to know
what the future holds, don't you?

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.951
That's C-4.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:46.591
It'll turn this house into dust
and also separate every part of you...

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.672
- from every other part of you.
- Let her go. You've got me.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.150
I don't want you.
Agent Walker is too visible.

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:58.394
But Officer Walker, dead,
is just another D.C. Statistic.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:01.597
When he's gone,
you're gone.

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.511
Get the younger one.
I want him to see this.

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.591
- He's dead.
- No, he's not, you moron.

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:08.478
If he were dead,
he would not be here. Get him.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:11.597
Let her go!

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.237
- What do you want?
- You're a bright boy.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.470
Why don't you sleep on it?

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.471
I did that.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.989
It's different
than before, isn't it?

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.832
It's what happens
when you change time.

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:09.595
Lines of confluence,
probability scales, all that shit.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.118
Put your gun
on the floor.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:17.158
What were you gonna do? Shoot me?

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.237
A bomb is gonna go off any second now.
You know what happens then?

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:25.437
We're all gonna be dead.
I'm gonna win by default.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.636
My young self
is still gonna be president...

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.153
and you can't save your wife.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.674
Just like you couldn't
save her once before.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.228
She died because you came back
and made some changes.

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.629
Now you're gonna
fuck with time.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.713
- You're as bad as me.
- Wrong. I'm setting it right.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.470
Usually I hate doing things
more than once...

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.630
but in this case,
I don't see any other option.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.950
I do.

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.673
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.320
You called me. You left a message
with the senate operator.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.392
I didn't leave any message,
you fucking idiot!

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.596
Don't argue among yourself.
I left it.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:05.114
Now nobody's got a future.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:08.158
Okay.
This is a real mess now.

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:10.356
I hope you're happy.
This is a real mess.

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.079
You turned a simple, ordinary murder
into a bloodbath.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.119
You get out of here. Get out of here.
Go! Now! Go!

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:26.238
- You two should be closer.
- Keep him away from me.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.151
The same matter
can't occupy the same space.

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:31.676
I'm still kicking.
I must be on Broadway.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.716
No!

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:16.671
Coordinates downloaded
to G.P.S. Sequencer.

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.751
Re-entry sequence
is completed.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.799
Launch bay alert
is now terminated.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.360
Hey, where you goin'?

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:55.036
- What happened to you?
- What are you talkin' about?

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.111
You're walking around.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:02.069
I've been doing that since I was
about two. Does that seem abnormal?

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.914
I...

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:11.832
- What's going on with Senator McComb?
- Senator McComb?

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.037
If you want time off, ask. Don't act
like you're out of your head.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.556
- I've got a blank spot.
- You've got a hole in your head.

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:21.916
Ten years ago, McComb left his office,
canceled all his appointments...

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.036
disappeared,
nobody's ever seen him since.

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:27.112
That's so sad.
I-I-I remember.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.191
What are you hangin' around for?

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.997
Database 309, shut down.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:57.758
Secondary system team
to back storage.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.037
This time,
stay away from trouble.

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.076
Do I know you?

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:06.152
I guess not.

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.031
Hey! Bobby Morgan is still
waiting for a second chance.

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.596
- Destination, please.
- Home.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.151
Dad!

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.115
Dad, Mom said you'd
barbecue hot dogs.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.077
Yeah.

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.119
- What kind of day did you have?
- Busy.

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.237
You all right?

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:35.909
Great.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.911
Good.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.991
Come here.

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.071
I have something
to tell you.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.311
Take your time.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:24.351
I can't wait forever

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:31.590
Even though you want me to

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.990
I can't wait forever

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:44.355
To know if you'll be true

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:47.398
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:50.597
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.752
Time won't let me

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.115
Wait that long

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:15.877
Can't you see
I've waited too long

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:22.274
To love you and hold you
in my arms

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:28.515
I can't wait forever

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:34.596
Even though you want me to

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.797
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:40.952
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:44.237
Time won't let me

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:23.559
I can't wait forever

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.672
Even though you want me to

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:36.232
I can't wait forever

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:42.356
To know if you'll be true

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:46.957
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:50.157
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:53.437
Time won't let me

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.949
Wait that long

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.477
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.518
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.797
Time won't let me

01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:31.748
Time won't let me

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:37.118
Wait that long

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.317
Wait that long

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.836
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I hear you talkin' to you, baby

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:47.196
Gotta get you back inside of my arms

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:50.238
Oh pretty baby, won't you listen to me
Can't you tell how much I need you

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.596
Can't you tell my love is so strong

01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:56.990
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
