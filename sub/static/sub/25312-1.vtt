00:41.505 --> 00:44.865
So Mr Paul Michaels

00:45.365 --> 00:49.005
What was it that made you
decide to come round tonight?

00:49.425 --> 00:51.385
Well Miss.... Tiffany...

00:52.225 --> 00:54.565
...I've forgotten your last name

00:54.865 --> 00:56.445
Rose, Tiffany Rose

00:56.505 --> 00:58.065
Well Miss Tiffany Rose

00:58.205 --> 01:02.205
I uh... guess I had nothing better to do

01:02.325 --> 01:03.943
Oh, charming!

01:03.945 --> 01:06.785
Why not be completely honest and
just say there's nothing good on TV

01:08.205 --> 01:09.425
I didn't want to be rude

01:10.185 --> 01:12.485
But... Seriously

01:14.025 --> 01:16.865
We've been messaging each other for ages

01:17.065 --> 01:18.345
Why today?

01:20.105 --> 01:23.165
It took me a while 'cos it's
a bit awkward, you know...

01:23.265 --> 01:27.445
With you being Stacey's
friend, one of her best friends

01:27.585 --> 01:28.985
And, she's my ex

01:30.145 --> 01:35.585
Yeah, well, I wouldn't really consider her
to be my best friend, I mean we're more like

01:36.085 --> 01:37.825
Friends of a friend

01:38.205 --> 01:41.965
Laura is my best friend, Stacey
just happens to be one of hers

01:42.985 --> 01:44.725
Ah it's still awkward though

01:45.445 --> 01:49.425
But anyway, where were we?

01:50.225 --> 01:52.863
I think you were about to tell me

01:52.865 --> 01:55.883
how attractive you find
me and how much you like me

01:55.885 --> 01:59.185
Oh yeah? Well, we could do that

01:59.605 --> 02:02.305
or we could skip that bit

02:09.305 --> 02:12.085
Hold that thought, I'll be right back

03:01.765 --> 03:02.743
Oh!

03:02.745 --> 03:03.745
Um...

03:04.445 --> 03:06.165
What are you doing?

03:06.285 --> 03:07.325
I'm waiting for you

03:08.425 --> 03:09.385
Seriously!?

03:09.845 --> 03:11.645
Yesh, you know you want it

03:12.545 --> 03:13.945
I thought you wanted to...

03:14.005 --> 03:15.845
Fuck someone I hardly know?

03:16.665 --> 03:19.345
Seriously! What kind of
a girl do you take me for?

03:20.605 --> 03:23.445
You know, some girls do like
the chase and all you know!

03:23.925 --> 03:28.165
You think that one little kiss leads
to an instant leap to penetration?

03:29.625 --> 03:30.845
Um...

03:31.365 --> 03:32.825
um...

03:33.085 --> 03:34.405
Err, um...!

03:34.725 --> 03:37.345
You know what, just get
your stuff and just go!

03:37.925 --> 03:39.825
Alright, I got it wrong, I thought...

03:42.225 --> 03:44.585
I thought that, you know...

03:45.065 --> 03:46.365
I didn't mean to...

03:46.625 --> 03:48.085
Didn't mean to what exactly?

03:48.485 --> 03:50.465
You know what, Stacey said you were a prick

03:50.705 --> 03:53.285
I thought maybe she got it
wrong, but clearly, she didn't

03:54.145 --> 03:55.285
Just get out.

03:55.545 --> 03:56.945
Stacey would have been up for it

03:57.425 --> 04:00.223
Yeah well Stacey, is a slut

04:00.225 --> 04:01.225
I'm not.

04:33.085 --> 04:33.605
Hello?

04:34.225 --> 04:35.225
You ok?

04:40.685 --> 04:43.045
Get away from the house

04:44.165 --> 04:45.165
Hello?

04:45.385 --> 04:46.505
Are you alright?

07:48.445 --> 07:51.503
Jesus fucking christ Mark,
what the hell are you doing?

07:51.505 --> 07:55.045
Oh, come on, that was priceless!
You should have seen your face!

07:55.505 --> 07:56.823
You think that's funny?

07:56.825 --> 07:59.505
Oh yeah, really fucking
clever, well done Mark!

08:00.165 --> 08:01.625
Lighten up sis

08:01.745 --> 08:02.865
Go fuck yourself

08:03.765 --> 08:07.463
You know you really are the most immature
dickhead of a brother I could have asked for

08:07.465 --> 08:08.785
You really are.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.203
Where you going now

08:12.205 --> 08:14.345
This immature dickhead
brother is going for a smoke

09:32.905 --> 09:34.065
Mark?

09:35.525 --> 09:37.345
Mark is that weed?

09:38.985 --> 09:41.305
If you think I won't tell Dad, I will!

09:43.265 --> 09:45.625
It stinks Mark, it's really strong!

09:48.885 --> 09:52.805
Seriously, if you think I'm falling
for your pranks twice in one night

09:54.645 --> 09:55.645
Mark

09:58.605 --> 09:59.603
Mark!

09:59.605 --> 10:00.105
Mark?

10:17.865 --> 10:19.745
I'm not falling for your pranks again

10:20.265 --> 10:22.265
I'm calling your bluff Mark

10:24.125 --> 10:25.945
You can come out now

10:30.285 --> 10:31.105
Mark

10:33.805 --> 10:34.405
Mark!

10:43.185 --> 10:45.405
I know you're out here

10:51.045 --> 10:51.765
Boo!

11:21.485 --> 11:22.265
RUN!

13:21.845 --> 13:24.845
Wake up sleepy head! Today's the day!

13:53.665 --> 13:56.803
Jack! Wake up, it's camping day so get up

13:56.805 --> 13:58.545
get ready, and we'll go and get pissed!

14:48.025 --> 14:51.243
Hey, this is Tiffany,
I'm unavailable right now

14:51.245 --> 14:53.523
but if you leave me a message
then I'll get back to you

14:53.525 --> 14:54.963
as soon as possible.

14:54.965 --> 14:55.845
Bye!

14:57.825 --> 15:00.845
Where's Tiffany? I've called her
like 6 times, she said she'd be here!

15:25.185 --> 15:28.443
Ah she's blatantly with Stevie, he
said he'd meet us at the site later

15:28.445 --> 15:29.503
and you know she wants to

15:29.505 --> 15:30.443
...fuck him senseless?

15:30.445 --> 15:31.123
Oh yes!

15:31.125 --> 15:33.663
Yeah, I'm sure they'll come
together, that's if Stevie isn't

15:33.665 --> 15:35.205
too high to find us of course!

15:35.325 --> 15:36.823
Can we just go already?!

15:36.825 --> 15:38.943
I don't care about Tiffany, or Stevie.

15:38.945 --> 15:41.725
If we're actually going to do this
camping shit, then let's just go!

15:41.945 --> 15:43.883
Please, let's not fight

15:43.885 --> 15:45.405
we need this weekend

15:45.965 --> 15:47.623
It's been rubbish for everyone lately

15:47.625 --> 15:49.323
and I just want to have
everyone I love together

15:49.325 --> 15:50.205
having a good time.

15:53.505 --> 15:55.943
Yeah Richie Rich, don't be a prick!

15:55.945 --> 15:58.183
And let's not forget who
wasn't actually invited

15:58.185 --> 16:01.165
this weekend was about
friends spending time together

16:01.505 --> 16:02.505
friends?

16:02.885 --> 16:04.005
Do you get what I'm saying?

16:04.465 --> 16:08.103
Like I'm going to let my girl spend
the weekend with you delinquents,

16:08.105 --> 16:09.943
a slag, a bender,

16:09.945 --> 16:11.305
two blokes I haven't even met yet

16:11.805 --> 16:14.185
Well this is going to be a fun car journey

16:15.965 --> 16:18.545
Can you at least try to be nice to them?

16:18.885 --> 16:20.145
Why? They're not my friends

16:20.185 --> 16:22.285
They may not be your
friends, but they are mine

16:22.525 --> 16:23.523
Listen babe,

16:23.525 --> 16:25.103
you don't need them,

16:25.105 --> 16:25.945
you've got me now

16:26.445 --> 16:27.325
Please?

16:27.765 --> 16:30.185
If I play nice I expect
you to do me a favour

16:30.665 --> 16:31.285
What?

16:33.945 --> 16:34.745
Get in the car

16:35.165 --> 16:36.525
Not until you make a promise

16:36.805 --> 16:38.903
Fine! Just get in,

16:38.905 --> 16:40.103
be nice and

16:40.105 --> 16:41.345
try to have fun

18:15.525 --> 18:16.825
This is going to be fun

18:17.225 --> 18:19.223
Just so you know, I'm
planning on drinking about

18:19.225 --> 18:21.845
60 percent of all the
alcohol we brought with us

18:22.285 --> 18:23.183
Good for you!

18:23.185 --> 18:25.223
I doubt Richard will let me drink that much

18:25.225 --> 18:26.825
he doesn't like me drinking too much

18:26.965 --> 18:28.523
Seriously Laura?

18:28.525 --> 18:30.843
I love you and you're my
best friend, but seriously,

18:30.845 --> 18:31.865
why are you with him?

18:31.885 --> 18:33.185
He's not all bad.

18:33.485 --> 18:36.623
Well, I've met him at least
5 times now and I've yet to

18:36.625 --> 18:38.545
identify any redeeming qualities

18:39.005 --> 18:39.825
Well

18:40.945 --> 18:44.123
He's the only guy that's wanted to
stay around for more than just a shag

18:44.125 --> 18:46.483
And I know I'm not exactly
Britain's Next Top Model

18:46.485 --> 18:47.425
hey, babe

18:47.545 --> 18:48.745
You're beautiful alright?

18:49.245 --> 18:52.105
And, I'm telling you,
you can do so much better

18:53.565 --> 18:54.645
Yeah I...

18:55.065 --> 18:57.385
could get a nicer person but...

18:58.665 --> 18:59.665
look at that!

19:00.405 --> 19:01.725
Doubt I'll get better looking

19:02.965 --> 19:04.065
Yeah ok...

19:04.805 --> 19:05.845
he is fit

19:06.365 --> 19:07.365
in a...

19:07.605 --> 19:09.285
weird kind of way. I'll
give him that, but...

19:09.885 --> 19:11.705
Nah, I couldn't put up with that.

19:12.805 --> 19:14.265
What are you two talking about?

19:14.585 --> 19:15.485
Nothing much

19:15.685 --> 19:18.825
except how much I want to have sex
with you, you shirtless hunk you.

19:19.005 --> 19:19.765
Fuck you

19:20.625 --> 19:22.563
I'm sorry! You want to fuck me?

19:22.565 --> 19:24.003
Dude, your girlfriend's right here!

19:24.005 --> 19:24.825
Stop it!

19:26.625 --> 19:27.745
Oh, so I'll just...

19:28.445 --> 19:29.645
I'll just go shall I?

19:33.825 --> 19:37.223
I've put the tent up now, how
about you make good on that promise?

19:37.225 --> 19:38.663
Not now

19:38.665 --> 19:41.165
Stevie should be here soon, I'm
hoping he brings his friend Alex

19:41.225 --> 19:41.945
Who's Alex?

19:42.285 --> 19:43.525
Just one of Stevie's friends

19:44.025 --> 19:46.125
I don't like that you
hang out with that Stevie

19:46.165 --> 19:47.685
or Jack for that matter

19:47.845 --> 19:48.345
Why?

19:49.065 --> 19:52.163
Don't like the idea of you being
around all these men when I'm not around

19:52.165 --> 19:53.165
what if they try something?

19:53.325 --> 19:56.405
Look Richard, I know you care but...

19:57.745 --> 20:00.645
Jack's gay, he's my best
friend. I'm pretty sure

20:00.665 --> 20:03.645
trying something is the
last thing on his mind

20:04.085 --> 20:06.063
I've known Stevie since I was 4

20:06.065 --> 20:07.965
We were neighbours and

20:08.005 --> 20:11.683
he was like a brother growing up, doing something
with him would be like doing something with

20:11.685 --> 20:12.583
family

20:12.585 --> 20:15.563
I still don't like it, and this Alex

20:15.565 --> 20:16.943
I'm assuming that's another guy?

20:16.945 --> 20:18.965
Yeah but, also gay.

20:19.065 --> 20:20.723
Oh man, that's all I need!

20:20.725 --> 20:22.465
Please tell me it isn't Alex Winter

20:22.645 --> 20:23.365
Why?

20:23.565 --> 20:26.723
I fucking used to doss around with
him until he told me he was a bender

20:26.725 --> 20:28.085
I'm sure he wanted to fuck me

20:28.345 --> 20:30.605
Those two going at it in the
next tent all night, great!

20:30.805 --> 20:33.265
I'm sure they're not going to and...

20:33.705 --> 20:35.023
What's wrong with that anyway?

20:35.025 --> 20:36.623
I can't stand it, it
makes me feel a bit ill.

20:36.625 --> 20:38.583
Richard! Seriously.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.245
Look, I can't help how it makes me feel

20:40.465 --> 20:42.303
I don't like it, it's not natural

20:42.305 --> 20:43.585
It is natural

20:44.545 --> 20:45.305
Ey-up!

20:45.565 --> 20:47.005
Stevie!

20:47.625 --> 20:48.425
Hey Loz

20:49.005 --> 20:50.145
How's it going?

20:52.825 --> 20:54.025
Stace, how's it going?

20:54.485 --> 20:55.523
Good, you?

20:55.525 --> 20:56.385
Very well cheers

20:56.785 --> 20:57.443
How's it going bud?

20:57.445 --> 20:58.183
Good you?

20:58.185 --> 20:59.265
Very well cheers, very well.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.303
So, when's this party starting?

21:01.305 --> 21:03.305
I've been asking the same thing!

21:04.285 --> 21:05.323
Where's Tiffany?

21:05.325 --> 21:06.545
I have no idea

21:06.765 --> 21:08.383
Oh, I thought she was coming with you?

21:08.385 --> 21:09.585
I haven't heard from her

21:09.785 --> 21:10.345
Oh

21:10.725 --> 21:12.105
Wonder why she didn't show up then?

21:37.745 --> 21:40.123
The reason she's not here is
because she never wanted to come

21:40.125 --> 21:42.223
That girl is a flaky as they come

21:42.225 --> 21:45.265
And the only reason why
Laura is asking you Stevie

21:45.465 --> 21:47.683
is because she assumed
that you were making babies

21:47.685 --> 21:50.763
I have not seen her or
spoke to her in a long time.

21:50.765 --> 21:51.265
We haven't even hooked up since, February?

22:08.725 --> 22:11.285
Anyway, let's forget about
Tiffany and let's get a drink

22:11.465 --> 22:12.465
OK sure

22:12.805 --> 22:14.205
Were you not bringing a friend?

22:14.245 --> 22:14.785
Huh?

22:15.245 --> 22:17.405
You said you were bringin a friend, Alex?

22:17.545 --> 22:20.165
Oh yeah, he's coming
later, he had to work today.

22:20.705 --> 22:21.705
Who's Alex?

22:22.025 --> 22:23.425
He's a mate of mine

22:23.845 --> 22:25.405
Funny guy, you'll like him

22:26.005 --> 22:27.005
Yeah,

22:27.625 --> 22:28.645
think you will!

22:29.085 --> 22:30.883
Oh please tell me this isn't a set-up

22:30.885 --> 22:32.565
No! It's just

22:33.105 --> 22:34.465
Stevie's friend

22:35.265 --> 22:36.545
visiting us

22:37.325 --> 22:38.963
What was that look for?

22:38.965 --> 22:40.443
And how do you know him?

22:40.445 --> 22:42.805
Oh, when I hang out with
Stevie, Alex is always there

22:42.945 --> 22:45.125
He's fun, cheeky but
funny, you'll like him.

22:45.345 --> 22:45.905
What?

22:45.965 --> 22:48.325
Ah can we speed this along
so we can get to the drinking?

22:48.465 --> 22:50.945
OK, here is the short
bullet-pointed version

22:51.165 --> 22:53.083
Stevie here has a homo friend

22:53.085 --> 22:54.705
Laura, here

22:54.945 --> 22:57.043
being the sweet innocent angel that she is

22:57.045 --> 23:00.345
thought that getting you two
out into the wilderness together

23:00.485 --> 23:04.083
would mean that you would get to put your dick
near something other than your own right hand.

23:04.085 --> 23:06.423
Firstly, screw you Stacey!

23:06.425 --> 23:10.243
Secondly, seriously Laura? How
desperate do you think I am?

23:10.245 --> 23:12.325
I don't! I just thought
you two might get along

23:12.565 --> 23:15.283
I thought you said you
spoke to him? Awkward!

23:15.285 --> 23:16.583
Yeah, you're telling me!

23:16.585 --> 23:18.525
Look, he's just a nice guy

23:18.565 --> 23:20.043
I thought you'd like him,

23:20.045 --> 23:21.805
I thought we'd all like him.

23:22.305 --> 23:24.483
I'll vouch for Loz, he's a good guy

23:24.485 --> 23:27.585
lives at the end of my road and
throws the most awesome house parties

23:27.765 --> 23:29.023
known him for years

23:29.025 --> 23:30.985
and I so knew he was gay before he came out

23:31.125 --> 23:33.845
Well, he turned me down once, so I assumed

23:34.085 --> 23:35.605
Yeah, that was definitely it

23:35.705 --> 23:37.883
So am I the only one that doesn't know him?

23:37.885 --> 23:39.425
You've never even mentioned him before

23:40.125 --> 23:43.423
Yeah well we weren't friends
until I was doing that

23:43.425 --> 23:45.385
that stupid Paul Michaels

23:46.345 --> 23:47.045
remember?

23:50.245 --> 23:53.385
Anyway, he was best
friends with psycho Richard

23:53.625 --> 23:56.903
who now is Laura's every so
lovely and sweet boyfriend,

23:56.905 --> 23:58.165
and Alex

23:58.905 --> 24:02.003
Wait, I'm confused, I thought
you said he was your mate Stevie?

24:02.005 --> 24:03.005
He is

24:03.385 --> 24:07.423
No, they weren't friends
until after my ex, Paul and...

24:07.425 --> 24:08.523
Richard

24:08.525 --> 24:10.203
decided they didn't want
anything to do with him anymore

24:10.205 --> 24:12.165
because he came out loud and proud

24:12.825 --> 24:14.085
So how do you know him?

24:14.485 --> 24:16.525
I met him at a pub one
night when I was singing

24:17.145 --> 24:18.725
Good guy, we had a few beers

24:19.165 --> 24:20.725
Did you do some
man-on-man lovin'?

24:20.905 --> 24:22.725
No! No I'm not gay

24:22.905 --> 24:24.445
I don't care about all that shit though

24:25.185 --> 24:26.445
I take them as they come

24:27.005 --> 24:28.165
He's a good guy

24:28.585 --> 24:32.403
Wait a minute Laura, didn't you say
that he thought Jackie boy here was cute?

24:32.405 --> 24:33.743
What?

24:33.745 --> 24:36.365
Oh my God, this just gets more humiliating.

24:36.945 --> 24:40.205
He did, I'm sorry, I thought
I was doing a good thing

24:41.285 --> 24:43.063
So how does he know what I look like?

24:43.065 --> 24:45.085
I might have shown him your Facebook

24:45.765 --> 24:46.765
Great!

24:47.085 --> 24:49.485
So he knows what I look
like, what does he look like?

24:49.945 --> 24:50.945
Is he fit?

24:51.205 --> 24:52.405
I'm not gay,

24:53.025 --> 24:54.285
but he's a good looking lad.

24:54.805 --> 24:55.825
You got any photos?

24:56.025 --> 24:58.243
Yeah I think I've got some from
the festival we last went to

24:58.245 --> 24:59.165
Oh I have!

24:59.185 --> 25:02.285
We went to a party last weekend,
I was his hag for the night

25:04.105 --> 25:05.585
Hmmm OK

25:06.985 --> 25:07.985
Look!

25:08.185 --> 25:10.125
That's him wasted, so he's
got to look better sober

25:11.785 --> 25:13.383
Yeah, well, I'm still not happy.

25:13.385 --> 25:14.985
Oh shut up, he's hot!

25:17.505 --> 25:20.463
I suppose I should go and
say hello to, is it, Rich?

25:20.465 --> 25:21.625
Yeah, Rich

25:25.525 --> 25:27.823
Hi, Rich, is it?

25:27.825 --> 25:28.865
It's Richard.

25:29.265 --> 25:30.625
Richard, I've been...

25:31.665 --> 25:34.903
hearing good things about you, that you
were getting pretty close with my Loz?

25:34.905 --> 25:36.185
It's my Laura

25:37.125 --> 25:38.965
things are very serious, mate

25:39.965 --> 25:41.603
I didn't mean anything by it

25:41.605 --> 25:43.083
you know, she's a friend of mine.

25:43.085 --> 25:46.885
I just think it's a bit weird that my
girlfriend's two best friends are men

25:48.845 --> 25:49.623
Does it matter?

25:49.625 --> 25:51.203
It does to me.

25:51.205 --> 25:54.043
I didn't mean to upset you, we're
just here to have a good time

25:54.045 --> 25:55.363
Chill out alright?

25:55.365 --> 25:56.985
Don't fucking tell me to chill out!

25:57.185 --> 25:59.165
Woah, come on...

25:59.605 --> 26:01.763
I don't want us to fight or
for you to get all aggressive

26:01.765 --> 26:02.863
Well maybe I do!

26:02.865 --> 26:06.245
Fucking walking up to me, calling
me your mate, telling me to chill out

26:06.365 --> 26:09.005
I'll fucking beat you! I don't know you!

26:10.505 --> 26:11.563
What's going on?

26:11.565 --> 26:13.363
Dunno, your boyfriend just exploded

26:13.365 --> 26:14.463
I only came up to say hello.

26:14.465 --> 26:16.663
Fucking dick doesn't think I know his game!

26:16.665 --> 26:17.703
Game? What Game?

26:17.705 --> 26:20.685
You fucking know man, nobody wants
you here, why don't you just do one?

26:20.885 --> 26:23.145
Hey prick! Let's keep it real yeah?

26:23.445 --> 26:25.785
We're all mates here, not including you

26:25.965 --> 26:29.165
You're the one no one wants
here you arrogant fuckwit!

26:29.385 --> 26:30.765
Stop it please!

26:31.485 --> 26:33.163
Everyone calm down,

26:33.165 --> 26:34.565
we've barely been here an hour

26:37.105 --> 26:39.325
I just wanted this to be
a nice weekend together

26:39.725 --> 26:41.145
It's supposed to be fun

26:42.385 --> 26:45.985
Richard, I love you, I'm
not going to cheat on you

26:46.805 --> 26:48.725
Stacey, Stevie

26:49.425 --> 26:51.325
Please, can we just start this over again?

26:55.105 --> 26:56.105
Please?

26:56.745 --> 26:57.745
For me?

26:58.125 --> 26:59.483
I'm going for a walk

26:59.485 --> 27:00.563
Don't go!

27:00.565 --> 27:02.583
Oh no, please don't go.

27:02.585 --> 27:03.585
Stacey!

27:13.305 --> 27:15.143
Did you have to antagonise him?

27:15.145 --> 27:16.503
I didn't do shit!

27:16.505 --> 27:18.245
You know he's a hot-headed prick!

27:18.925 --> 27:20.885
Can we just chill now?

27:21.405 --> 27:23.185
I'm sure he'll be back with
his tail between his legs

27:24.045 --> 27:27.085
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do anything

27:27.105 --> 27:29.045
I know. You didn't do anything.

27:29.465 --> 27:31.165
I'm the one that's sorry, he's

27:31.485 --> 27:34.303
really insecure and super sensitive.

27:34.305 --> 27:37.683
Right, come on, let's have some
drinks, let's have a good time

27:37.685 --> 27:42.123
I'll say sorry for any
offence I may have caused.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.743
What, like words like hello?

27:43.745 --> 27:46.703
OK, let's just move on

27:46.705 --> 27:49.345
Come on Laura, let's get some
drinks, I'm sure he'll be back later.

27:52.965 --> 27:55.563
So Stevie, what do you like to do for fun?

27:55.565 --> 27:57.965
Err don't know, drink?

27:58.025 --> 27:59.905
I also write some songs

27:59.985 --> 28:02.543
Really! Can you sing me a little song?

28:02.545 --> 28:03.925
Maybe later yeah?

28:06.025 --> 28:06.865
It's about time!

28:07.505 --> 28:09.645
Ah come on, give us a song

28:09.885 --> 28:11.305
Come on Stevie, you're good!

28:11.905 --> 28:13.025
Maybe later

28:13.045 --> 28:16.963
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

28:16.965 --> 28:19.345
Alright! Alright!

28:19.465 --> 28:22.585
I wrote this one earlier
OK, see what you think

28:22.785 --> 28:26.623
It's summer time and the
start are out at night

28:26.625 --> 28:30.505
I know this moment, well
it couldn't be anymore right

28:30.865 --> 28:35.025
This feeling insides like a
million butterflies taking flight

28:35.265 --> 28:39.205
We hold each other
close, under the moonlight

28:39.945 --> 28:41.343
What do you think?

28:41.345 --> 28:42.325
Yeah, you're good!

28:43.205 --> 28:44.823
You've got a smoking voice

28:44.825 --> 28:45.545
Ah cheers cherub

28:46.625 --> 28:49.683
Right, I'm just going to wonder
off and see if I can get some signal

28:49.685 --> 28:50.483
Why?

28:50.485 --> 28:51.205
Because...

28:52.025 --> 28:55.385
Yeah this is lame. I told my
mum I'd call her when we arrived

28:55.505 --> 28:56.385
Ah mummies boy

28:56.405 --> 28:59.925
Yeah, shut up, she worries
alright? I'm her only child

28:59.965 --> 29:02.485
Well get going then so we
can get the party started!

29:03.085 --> 29:04.543
I want all the classics tonight,

29:04.545 --> 29:05.825
alcohol

29:06.445 --> 29:07.903
songs by the camp fire

29:07.905 --> 29:09.143
marshmallows

29:09.145 --> 29:10.405
truth or dare

29:10.485 --> 29:12.025
Truth or dare, are we five?

29:12.565 --> 29:13.763
Not when I'm playing

29:13.765 --> 29:15.443
I rise to every challenge

29:15.445 --> 29:16.965
I never back down

29:45.645 --> 29:46.705
Oh God!

29:46.725 --> 29:49.943
I'm so sorry, I thought you
could hear me coming so...

29:49.945 --> 29:51.745
No, sorry, I was in a world of my own

29:58.805 --> 29:59.725
Well I'm Alex

29:59.925 --> 30:01.445
Sorry, err, I'm Jack

30:03.685 --> 30:04.185
Yeah

30:05.465 --> 30:07.205
AS creepy as it sounds I...

30:07.725 --> 30:08.345
I know

30:08.885 --> 30:11.245
Oh, yeah I've

30:11.965 --> 30:13.465
only just learnt this.

30:13.625 --> 30:14.905
Yeah, that just sounds bad!

30:16.545 --> 30:18.685
You know what? Let's just start again

30:19.865 --> 30:20.865
Hi

30:21.005 --> 30:22.303
I'm Alex

30:22.305 --> 30:24.085
It's fine, don't worry

30:26.905 --> 30:28.063
So where's everybody else?

30:28.065 --> 30:32.005
Oh I just came out here to see if
I could get some signal to erm...

30:33.585 --> 30:36.765
Actually, never mind. I can take
you back to them if you want?

30:37.325 --> 30:37.925
Err...

30:38.345 --> 30:38.845
Nah

30:40.045 --> 30:40.545
No rush

30:41.765 --> 30:43.305
We can just chill here
for a bit if you want?

30:44.405 --> 30:45.565
I'm pretty sure that's what they

30:46.105 --> 30:47.325
intended

30:47.625 --> 30:49.445
for us to do anyways

30:50.405 --> 30:50.985
Sure

30:52.065 --> 30:54.125
So, what are the plans for tonight?

30:54.705 --> 30:58.305
Err, from what I just
heard, signing, drinking

30:58.325 --> 30:59.665
and truth or dare

31:00.485 --> 31:01.485
OK

31:02.705 --> 31:03.905
I'm always up for a good dare

31:23.325 --> 31:24.325
Jessica?

31:39.545 --> 31:40.305
Damn it!

31:40.765 --> 31:41.765
Who's there?!

31:45.945 --> 31:46.945
Cut it out!

31:47.345 --> 31:48.345
Stacey!

31:49.045 --> 31:50.545
Fucking show yourself you slut!

31:55.985 --> 31:57.505
RUN!

33:09.245 --> 33:11.865
So err... What do you do for fun?

33:12.825 --> 33:13.365
People

33:14.705 --> 33:17.685
Oh God sorry, that was lame!

33:18.745 --> 33:22.305
But, no, I... I was trying to be funny.

33:23.125 --> 33:24.525
Oh God I'm such a dick

33:24.885 --> 33:25.765
That's fine!

33:27.245 --> 33:28.863
Shame it isn't true

33:28.865 --> 33:30.745
It couldn't be further from the truth

33:31.785 --> 33:34.763
Wait! No, that sounds bad too. Shall
I just take you back to the camp

33:34.765 --> 33:37.465
before I put you off liking me for good?

33:38.325 --> 33:39.325
Big head!

33:39.625 --> 33:41.465
Thinking I liked you in the first place!

33:41.585 --> 33:42.883
Oh shit.

33:42.885 --> 33:45.283
I'm terrible at talking hot guys

33:45.285 --> 33:48.243
I should like, just be banned. Just

33:48.245 --> 33:49.803
Confined to my house

33:49.805 --> 33:50.625
I err...

33:51.585 --> 33:53.685
I didn't mean to imply that you liked me

33:56.065 --> 33:57.443
So you think I'm hot?

33:57.445 --> 33:58.303
Yeah?

33:58.305 --> 33:59.705
Shit

34:00.585 --> 34:03.745
This is the point where the ground
should just like, swallow me all up

34:04.865 --> 34:05.365
But

34:07.165 --> 34:08.385
you are a good looking guy

34:11.065 --> 34:13.303
Sorry,

34:13.304 --> 34:15.264
I was just checking you out and...

34:15.730 --> 34:16.864
all I heard was...

34:18.125 --> 34:19.125
swallow

34:20.364 --> 34:22.225
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

34:23.364 --> 34:24.545
Relax

34:26.005 --> 34:27.005
You're hot man

34:28.165 --> 34:29.165
Sweet

34:30.385 --> 34:31.985
and you've got a cute smile

34:32.005 --> 34:34.005
Nah I'm, I'm far from cute

34:35.065 --> 34:36.065
You calling me a liar?

34:36.085 --> 34:37.824
No, polite!

34:38.264 --> 34:39.645
I've no reason to be polite

34:41.025 --> 34:42.025
So um...

34:42.784 --> 34:43.925
What made you agree to come?

34:45.065 --> 34:46.065
Told you man

34:47.205 --> 34:50.445
It's not every day your best friend tells you
that he's got a good looking friend who's single

34:52.425 --> 34:53.025
Thank you

34:54.585 --> 34:57.005
Right! Take me to this camp

34:57.625 --> 35:00.065
We need to get you a drink
and calm you down a bit

35:45.265 --> 35:46.265
Hey guys!

35:46.465 --> 35:47.923
Where the hell have you been?

35:47.925 --> 35:51.345
Ah, a mysterious stranger
has appeared! Alright Alex?

35:52.005 --> 35:54.623
Alright Stace? Recovered from last week?

35:54.625 --> 35:56.425
You bet! Ready and raring to go again!

35:57.025 --> 35:59.005
Hell mate, nice to see you

35:59.425 --> 36:00.425
Take that

36:01.865 --> 36:02.865
Alright Laura

36:02.985 --> 36:03.985
nice to see you!

36:04.085 --> 36:05.085
Good to see you

36:06.285 --> 36:07.603
So what are we doing?!

36:07.605 --> 36:08.905
Partying!!!

36:09.665 --> 36:12.745
Wait, did you guys seen Richard
anywhere? He's been gone a while

36:13.245 --> 36:14.623
Nah, we didn't see him anywhere.

36:14.625 --> 36:16.063
Can't say I'm unhappy about that.

36:16.065 --> 36:19.105
Hopefully he's got the message he
wasn't wanted and he's gone home.

36:25.665 --> 36:27.025
What car was he driving?

36:27.325 --> 36:28.843
I parked next to a red Honda

36:28.845 --> 36:31.583
Nah that's mine. Was it the blue Picasso?

36:31.585 --> 36:32.645
Yeah, that's his.

36:32.945 --> 36:33.825
Nah

36:34.705 --> 36:35.905
there was only a red one

36:35.925 --> 36:37.865
See! He's done the sensible
thing and he's left.

36:38.165 --> 36:40.303
But, why would he leave?

36:40.305 --> 36:42.245
Half this stuff is his,
he was our ride home

36:42.745 --> 36:45.143
Ah it's alright, I can give
you a lift. It's no hassle.

36:45.145 --> 36:46.165
Yeah, same!

36:47.345 --> 36:49.265
Look, do you want that
prick to ruin the weekend?

36:50.045 --> 36:51.225
No! But...

36:52.405 --> 36:54.003
This weekend is supposed to be about fun!

36:54.005 --> 36:57.425
We came here for you, and to have
fun, so let's just do that already!

36:58.005 --> 36:59.485
So where am I sleeping?

36:59.825 --> 37:02.203
Well it just so happens that
you've got a couple of choices Alex.

37:02.205 --> 37:03.185
Choice number one,

37:03.345 --> 37:04.963
you can come and crash with me,

37:04.965 --> 37:06.045
choice number two,

37:06.205 --> 37:08.003
you can sleep with the lovely Laura,

37:08.005 --> 37:09.685
or, choice number three,

37:09.905 --> 37:12.063
which I think is going to
be your preferred choice,

37:12.065 --> 37:14.305
is bunking down with your hot blind date.

37:16.605 --> 37:17.925
So where's Stevie sleeping?

37:18.265 --> 37:20.685
Ah, I'm hard-core! I'll
sleep under the stars.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.943
Loz, did you bring that sleeping bag?

37:22.945 --> 37:24.045
Yeah, it's in the tent

37:25.105 --> 37:26.363
That's alright

37:26.365 --> 37:28.265
I think I know where I'm sleeping!

38:25.785 --> 38:28.085
Right, I need to pee!

38:28.385 --> 38:31.985
I want to go now before it gets dark, because
otherwise I'll trip over and wee all over myself!

38:32.025 --> 38:32.965
Lovely!

38:33.705 --> 38:35.003
Don't forget to wipe!

38:35.005 --> 38:35.985
Thanks!!

38:51.265 --> 38:53.325
Stevie, is that you?

38:53.765 --> 38:57.365
Ahh if you're trying to watch me pee, that's
creepy! I'm not into that sort of thing!

39:07.405 --> 39:08.405
Excuse me!

39:08.645 --> 39:10.863
Jesus fucking Christ! Who the hell are you?

39:10.865 --> 39:12.503
Um, hi, I'm Marcus

39:12.505 --> 39:14.203
Well I'm sure it's very
nice to meet you Marcus!

39:14.205 --> 39:16.903
Why are you watching me trying
to pee, and who the hell are you?

39:16.905 --> 39:19.805
I'm not, I'm not! Honestly, I'm
just glad to have found someone.

39:19.825 --> 39:21.263
Sounds very suspicious to me!

39:21.265 --> 39:22.943
Well, I was with a group,

39:22.945 --> 39:24.865
and they went off to look
at something and I lost them!

39:25.485 --> 39:26.323
A group?

39:26.325 --> 39:27.225
Yeah yeah!

39:27.325 --> 39:28.303
A dogging group?

39:28.305 --> 39:31.005
No No! It's a ghost hunting group!

39:31.485 --> 39:32.785
Ghost hunting...

39:33.245 --> 39:34.703
You have got to be shitting me!

39:34.705 --> 39:35.705
No seriously, look!

39:39.085 --> 39:40.185
Oh this is tragic!

39:40.605 --> 39:42.525
I don't know where your group
is, but can I borrow you?

39:45.345 --> 39:46.865
Look what I found!!

39:47.085 --> 39:48.043
Who's this?

39:48.045 --> 39:48.583
Hi I'm...

39:48.585 --> 39:49.883
This is Marcus,

39:49.885 --> 39:50.405
and no,

39:50.465 --> 39:51.745
he's not a stripper

39:52.125 --> 39:53.163
Well,

39:53.165 --> 39:54.643
unless you want him to be!

39:54.645 --> 39:58.665
But no, anyway, Marcus here
is a professional ghost hunter!

39:58.845 --> 39:59.383
Seriously?

39:59.385 --> 40:01.683
Yes Jack! Let's not judge.

40:01.685 --> 40:02.725
I think that's cool.

40:02.885 --> 40:03.625
You would!

40:03.985 --> 40:06.683
So come on the love, fill them in
on what you've been investigating!

40:06.685 --> 40:07.905
Um... OK

40:07.925 --> 40:10.123
Are we really doing ghost stories?

40:10.125 --> 40:12.003
Is this not a camp site tradition?

40:12.005 --> 40:13.905
Is this not what I promised you tonight?

40:14.065 --> 40:15.303
And,

40:15.305 --> 40:16.685
it's about a death

40:17.065 --> 40:20.145
that happened in these very woods!

40:20.225 --> 40:21.143
Really?

40:21.145 --> 40:22.365
Come on, fill them in!

40:22.685 --> 40:24.223
OK so, where to start?

40:24.225 --> 40:25.685
This is getting beyond corny

40:26.045 --> 40:28.703
I could just leave, I just want to
find my group before it gets dark

40:28.705 --> 40:29.885
No it's fine, come on.

40:31.005 --> 40:32.963
Yeah, I want to hear it!

40:32.965 --> 40:34.005
OK, OK...

40:34.505 --> 40:38.123
So, 25 years ago, there was a
young teenage girl called Jessica

40:38.125 --> 40:39.845
who got pregnant and had a baby

40:40.265 --> 40:43.145
she was bullied by the kids in
her school and in the neighbourhood

40:43.225 --> 40:44.103
and then one day...

40:44.105 --> 40:47.203
just a few days after giving
birth she snapped and ran away.

40:47.205 --> 40:50.585
She ran into the woods, these
woods to precise and hanged herself!

40:51.645 --> 40:53.945
The baby was left and died of hypothermia.

40:54.105 --> 40:57.185
She left a note behind, simply
saying "Just leave us in peace".

40:59.825 --> 41:00.685
Ever since

41:00.705 --> 41:05.483
These woods and the roads and streets where she lived
there's been reports and sightings of hearing a baby cry...

41:05.485 --> 41:08.485
and a small woman in grey walking
through the woods and streets

41:09.045 --> 41:10.085
Why grey?

41:10.245 --> 41:12.305
Apparently that's what she
was wearing when she died.

41:12.385 --> 41:13.125
So where did she live?

41:13.265 --> 41:14.245
In the Bracknell area.

41:14.425 --> 41:16.663
We did a ghost hunt in
the roads where she lived

41:16.665 --> 41:23.225
can't remember the name, but we didn't find anything. As we
were leaving someone found a grey scarf on a street sign...

41:23.645 --> 41:25.765
It wasn't there when we started.

41:25.925 --> 41:27.505
How do we not know about this?

41:27.685 --> 41:30.685
It's an old story, but as with a
lot of news reports they come and go.

41:31.345 --> 41:35.585
The sightings have become quite frequent and Jessica has
become a bit of legend in the ghost hunting community.

41:36.005 --> 41:37.285
That is beyond creepy!

41:37.385 --> 41:38.545
But that's not all either

41:38.725 --> 41:41.545
there's a farm shop at
the end of these woods.

41:41.565 --> 41:45.103
The two shop keepers one day saw
a small woman, dressed in grey

41:45.105 --> 41:47.825
walk in and pick up a pint of
milk and walk straight out again.

41:48.065 --> 41:49.805
The two shop keepers couldn't believe it...

41:49.925 --> 41:52.285
then two weeks later the same happened.

41:52.445 --> 41:55.885
The small woman in grey walked in, picked
up a pint of milk and walked straight out.

41:56.305 --> 41:59.245
This time they followed her, but
they couldn't see where she went.

41:59.345 --> 42:01.565
So when it happened the third
time, they followed her instantly.

42:02.105 --> 42:05.185
They followed her to these woods. But
they couldn't see again, where she went.

42:05.285 --> 42:06.785
But they could hear a baby crying.

42:06.945 --> 42:08.145
So they followed that noise.

42:08.285 --> 42:11.325
And eventually came upon a memorial
plot for Jessica and her baby.

42:11.665 --> 42:15.285
The crying immediately stopped and they noticed
on the ground three empty bottles of milk.

42:16.225 --> 42:18.025
Oooo... spooky!

42:19.225 --> 42:22.525
Thank you Marcus, that was brilliant!
You can go and find your gang now.

42:22.805 --> 42:23.805
Oh...

42:26.405 --> 42:29.905
You can stay if you want? Sorry
Stacey lacks people skills.

42:30.645 --> 42:31.645
Do you want a drink?

42:31.705 --> 42:34.465
No I should really find my friends
before, before it gets dark.

43:01.025 --> 43:02.025
Hello?

43:03.465 --> 43:04.625
Guys, is that you?

43:21.665 --> 43:22.325
Andrew?

43:23.825 --> 43:24.825
Shelley?

43:26.165 --> 43:26.665
David?

43:32.665 --> 43:35.025
Look... I came and told you
the story because you asked!

43:35.105 --> 43:36.225
Don't take the piss, yeah?

43:40.685 --> 43:42.325
Jessica?

43:43.285 --> 43:44.645
Jessica, is that you?

43:47.185 --> 43:48.285
Show yourself?

43:51.785 --> 43:53.225
Jessica, say something?

43:54.470 --> 43:55.470
I can help you...

43:57.465 --> 43:58.465
Jessica?

44:02.225 --> 44:03.845
Where are you?

44:13.325 --> 44:14.565
Stupid fucking thing!

44:23.425 --> 44:25.365
There coming for you!!

44:25.665 --> 44:26.305
Fuck!

44:57.865 --> 45:00.323
Go on Stevie, give us another song...

45:00.325 --> 45:02.105
No, I'm far to wasted...

45:04.125 --> 45:07.143
Honestly I'm knackered, I'm gone.

45:07.145 --> 45:08.505
I want to hear you singing.

45:08.765 --> 45:09.265
Yeah!

45:11.105 --> 45:12.943
Would it make you happy Stacey?

45:12.945 --> 45:14.045
It would make me very happy!

45:14.205 --> 45:14.705
And me!

45:14.805 --> 45:15.565
See...

45:16.625 --> 45:18.185
Do a different one from before.

45:18.505 --> 45:24.585
"Birds flying high, you know how I feel"

45:25.785 --> 45:28.985
"Sun in the sky"

45:29.425 --> 45:33.045
"You know how I feel"

45:33.745 --> 45:37.405
"Breeze driftin' on by"

45:37.685 --> 45:41.465
You know how I feel, that's drunk!

45:43.545 --> 45:45.483
I love your voice!

45:45.485 --> 45:46.425
Cheers Cherub!

45:48.645 --> 45:51.643
I officially have the smallest bladder...

45:51.645 --> 45:54.125
known to man.

45:57.665 --> 45:59.265
Remember to wipe again!

46:04.725 --> 46:07.325
That ghost hunting guy
freaked me out a bit.

46:07.585 --> 46:08.585
Why?

46:09.625 --> 46:13.105
I just don't like the idea
of someone feeling that alone.

46:13.925 --> 46:14.925
Like...

46:15.065 --> 46:18.085
can you imagine feeling
like everyone is against you,

46:18.145 --> 46:21.245
so much that kill
yourself and your own baby.

46:21.745 --> 46:24.005
I know...

46:24.145 --> 46:27.643
but it is just a story. I mean we
don't know the whole in's and outs.

46:27.645 --> 46:29.465
For all we know it might not even be real.

46:29.905 --> 46:31.545
It must be based on something.

46:32.785 --> 46:34.065
Don't let it bother you.

46:35.245 --> 46:37.005
I won't, don't worry.

46:38.025 --> 46:41.063
I am having a good time. It's
just it freaked me out a bit.

46:41.065 --> 46:43.805
And then with Richard disappearing on me.

46:44.085 --> 46:46.325
I just feel a bit...

46:48.365 --> 46:49.425
Ohh... I don't know.

46:49.785 --> 46:50.785
But...

46:52.285 --> 46:56.465
I am having a good time. And
you got to meet Richard. So...

46:57.385 --> 46:59.005
now you know what he's like.

46:59.885 --> 47:01.205
He wasn't what I pictured though.

47:01.545 --> 47:03.463
No, he's not all bad.

47:03.465 --> 47:04.045
It's just.

47:05.045 --> 47:06.863
He hates me having friends

47:06.865 --> 47:09.945
that take me away from
him. And he worries a lot.

47:10.785 --> 47:12.205
That's not good.

47:12.365 --> 47:14.525
I think that's classed as emotional abuse.

47:14.545 --> 47:18.665
No... No, I know he seems a bit...

47:19.065 --> 47:20.065
But.

47:21.605 --> 47:24.645
It's not all bad, he treats
me well when we're alone.

47:24.905 --> 47:26.545
And

47:26.645 --> 47:29.283
I thought about breaking
it off with him in the past.

47:29.285 --> 47:31.365
But then I just think...

47:32.105 --> 47:34.665
or feel that he needs me

47:35.625 --> 47:36.625
Well,

47:37.665 --> 47:40.305
You just got to ask
yourself one simple question.

47:40.845 --> 47:41.965
Which is?

47:43.445 --> 47:44.745
Does he make you happy?

47:45.065 --> 47:46.705
That simple huh?

47:47.885 --> 47:49.485
So you enjoying your time in the woods?

47:50.925 --> 47:52.505
More than I expected.

47:53.225 --> 47:55.145
Now that I'm sharing a tent with you.

47:55.925 --> 47:57.785
Gives me something to smile about.

47:58.645 --> 47:59.645
Really?

48:02.605 --> 48:03.725
I'm like

48:04.085 --> 48:05.865
way beyond my limit right now.

48:06.385 --> 48:08.125
All part of my master plan!

48:09.105 --> 48:10.765
That sounded rapey!

48:11.205 --> 48:12.005
You love it!

48:15.205 --> 48:16.205
So um...

48:16.985 --> 48:18.505
a kiss is out of the question then?

48:19.145 --> 48:20.465
Are you trying your luck?

48:21.625 --> 48:22.125
Nah.

48:22.905 --> 48:23.985
I'm not really a great kisser.

48:25.365 --> 48:27.285
Why you always putting yourself down?

48:28.065 --> 48:31.445
I don't mean too, I'm
just not very confident.

48:32.425 --> 48:34.863
We have only just met... I mean

48:34.865 --> 48:38.305
I'm a lady after all, I wouldn't
do such a thing on a first date.

48:38.685 --> 48:40.345
I can help you with that!

48:41.745 --> 48:43.085
And believe me

48:43.590 --> 48:45.180
you ain't no lady.

48:46.765 --> 48:47.765
Yeh well...

48:49.045 --> 48:50.245
I have enjoyed your company.

48:51.285 --> 48:54.025
To be honest, I have not
smiled this much in a while.

48:55.905 --> 48:56.905
How come?

48:58.225 --> 48:59.605
Really want to get deep?

49:03.105 --> 49:04.705
You tell me?

49:05.325 --> 49:06.285
No... I didn't...

49:06.345 --> 49:07.345
I'm kidding!

49:07.925 --> 49:09.485
You take everything to literal.

49:10.865 --> 49:12.045
But on a serious note.

49:13.665 --> 49:14.665
Why haven't you laughed?

49:15.325 --> 49:16.325
Nah, you don't want to know.

49:17.725 --> 49:19.585
I wouldn't ask if I didn't want to know.

49:20.545 --> 49:21.545
Tell me.

49:22.625 --> 49:24.085
It's been a rough year.

49:24.625 --> 49:27.925
My mum and dad got divorced.
And then my mum got sick, so...

49:28.785 --> 49:29.785
It's been a pretty tough time.

49:30.560 --> 49:31.760
Sounds shitty.

49:33.640 --> 49:34.640
Don't worry.

49:35.965 --> 49:38.845
I've got a few things to help you
keep your mind off it for a while.

49:39.125 --> 49:39.865
Oh yeah?

49:40.345 --> 49:40.845
Try me.

49:41.465 --> 49:44.705
I think I've got a pack of cards somewhere!

49:46.885 --> 49:48.025
Fuck the cards!

49:58.125 --> 49:59.125
Shit.

49:59.820 --> 50:00.820
Umm...

50:01.600 --> 50:02.600
Listen.

50:02.830 --> 50:03.840
I'm sorry.

50:04.825 --> 50:07.245
I thought you wanted me too, so I just?

50:07.925 --> 50:09.125
It's not that I didn't want to.

50:11.325 --> 50:12.145
We just met...

50:12.545 --> 50:13.345
No, I get it.

50:13.945 --> 50:14.945
I'm sorry.

50:15.565 --> 50:16.565
No...

50:17.425 --> 50:18.605
please don't be sorry.

50:19.665 --> 50:20.305
Ahh Man...

50:21.045 --> 50:23.605
It's just me jumping the gun as always.

50:24.645 --> 50:25.645
You know what?

50:26.625 --> 50:27.785
Just forget it.

50:28.905 --> 50:29.905
And...

50:30.445 --> 50:31.825
I'm going to get some sleep.

51:16.325 --> 51:18.085
Get out of the woods!

52:15.925 --> 52:19.325
Come on, in you get
girl. It's late. Come on.

52:19.405 --> 52:22.063
What about Stacey?

52:22.065 --> 52:24.563
It's fine. She's probably
passed out somewhere.

52:24.565 --> 52:27.605
I'll go and find her in a
sec. Get yourself in, come on.

52:27.625 --> 52:29.105
No... But

52:29.725 --> 52:30.725
Ahh, no buts.

52:31.265 --> 52:32.985
In. Go on!

52:34.745 --> 52:36.265
Nighty night.

52:36.525 --> 52:38.445
Thanks Stevie, you're the best!

52:38.505 --> 52:39.005
I know!

52:40.585 --> 52:42.325
I'm going to go and find Stacey.

52:44.805 --> 52:45.805
Stacey?

52:51.845 --> 52:53.985
Stace....Stacey!!

52:56.925 --> 52:58.365
Stacey!!

52:59.665 --> 53:01.545
Ready to share that tent with you!

53:03.765 --> 53:04.765
STACEY?

53:06.065 --> 53:07.065
Get out of the woods!

53:07.765 --> 53:08.765
Stace?

53:11.265 --> 53:12.985
I could be your big spoon.

53:13.985 --> 53:16.245
You know you want to!

53:17.145 --> 53:17.705
Stacey!

53:20.185 --> 53:21.265
STACEY!!

53:25.685 --> 53:26.185
Stace?

53:27.285 --> 53:28.285
Cherub!

53:29.325 --> 53:30.325
Where are you?

53:33.445 --> 53:35.285
Stace!

53:39.065 --> 53:40.065
Stace?

53:48.225 --> 53:50.065
Stace, come on this
ain't funny now. Come on!

53:50.505 --> 53:51.505
Where are ya?

53:55.325 --> 53:56.305
Stace...

53:57.525 --> 53:58.525
Come on...

53:58.905 --> 53:59.905
Stace?

54:03.385 --> 54:04.385
Fuck, shit!!!

54:06.685 --> 54:07.685
FUCK!

54:08.925 --> 54:10.465
Fucking hell.

54:15.485 --> 54:17.185
Fuck. Arghh!

54:36.765 --> 54:37.765
Stacey!

54:39.545 --> 54:40.545
Laura!

54:44.285 --> 54:45.285
Jack!

55:04.885 --> 55:05.885
Stace...

57:24.865 --> 57:25.865
Are you asleep?

57:33.865 --> 57:36.285
It wasn't that I didn't want to kiss you.

57:37.445 --> 57:38.985
It was just a shock.

57:41.285 --> 57:43.765
Nobody has ever really been
that interested in me before.

57:45.085 --> 57:47.205
So I just assumed that

57:47.845 --> 57:48.845
I don't know.

57:49.625 --> 57:51.405
Things like that wouldn't happen to me.

57:53.245 --> 57:56.423
And you're like way hot, and I'm just...

57:56.425 --> 57:57.585
You're hot man.

57:58.225 --> 57:59.505
No, I'm not.

58:08.365 --> 58:09.365
You are.

58:10.905 --> 58:13.565
Not long before my mum got ill,

58:14.565 --> 58:16.745
I saw my mum and dad break up.

58:18.025 --> 58:19.025
She was heartbroken and

58:20.665 --> 58:23.045
I guess her low self-esteem
just rubbed off on me.

58:25.005 --> 58:27.485
And next she needed someone
to look after her and...

58:27.785 --> 58:28.785
I had no choice.

58:30.045 --> 58:32.125
I never really had time
to take care of myself.

58:34.585 --> 58:36.145
That's heart-breaking man.

58:40.925 --> 58:41.945
This whole

58:43.525 --> 58:45.885
confidence thing you see.

58:49.605 --> 58:51.105
It's all just a cover up.

58:54.005 --> 58:55.585
I live with just my dad.

58:58.805 --> 58:59.805
Typical
Jack-the-lad.

59:03.105 --> 59:05.445
You know he wanted me to be like him.

59:05.925 --> 59:07.425
And all of that shit.

59:09.825 --> 59:11.945
He's the only one that
don't know that I'm gay.

59:17.405 --> 59:18.665
When I first saw you

59:20.905 --> 59:22.625
I knew I wanted you.

59:26.105 --> 59:27.405
You were different.

59:30.085 --> 59:32.045
I kissed you out of nerves, and

59:33.025 --> 59:34.045
to be honest I just

59:37.125 --> 59:39.005
kind of scares me a bit.

59:39.385 --> 59:41.685
Nerves over kissing me?

59:42.065 --> 59:43.065
That's a first.

59:43.765 --> 59:46.645
And this is why I don't
express my feelings.

59:47.845 --> 59:50.165
Is this some kind of fucking
joke to you or something?

59:50.665 --> 59:52.085
No
- I'm sorry.

59:53.665 --> 59:54.665
Can we just...

59:54.965 --> 59:56.025
start again?

59:57.445 --> 59:59.165
Hi, I'm Jack.

01:00:00.765 --> 01:00:03.005
Shut up you idiot.

01:00:11.365 --> 01:00:14.425
I think I'm ready to redo that kiss.

01:00:18.505 --> 01:00:19.505
You sure?

01:00:20.925 --> 01:00:22.225
Don't play games.

01:00:23.085 --> 01:00:24.285
I like you Alex.

01:00:25.385 --> 01:00:26.385
A lot.

01:00:27.505 --> 01:00:29.505
And it's not everyday

01:00:30.325 --> 01:00:32.685
a sexy superstar stud like
you goes for a guy like me.

01:00:32.705 --> 01:00:34.025
Fuck me!! Shh...

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:41.125
If we do this, don't hurt me yeah?

01:00:41.165 --> 01:00:42.165
and

01:00:42.645 --> 01:00:44.105
not speak to me again.

01:05:17.885 --> 01:05:19.383
Jack wake up!

01:05:19.385 --> 01:05:20.665
I'm not ready to go again.

01:05:20.785 --> 01:05:21.925
Jack wake the fuck up!

01:05:22.365 --> 01:05:22.865
What?

01:05:23.505 --> 01:05:24.505
We need to get out of here.

01:05:25.885 --> 01:05:27.785
Jack wake up, get dressed!

01:05:37.645 --> 01:05:39.085
Alex what's going on?

01:05:40.165 --> 01:05:41.165
Just get dressed.

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:42.805
We need to get to the car.

01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:45.125
Jack.

01:05:46.325 --> 01:05:48.803
We need to get the fuck
out of these fucking woods!

01:05:48.805 --> 01:05:49.565
Why? What's going on?

01:05:50.865 --> 01:05:52.065
Jack listen to me.

01:05:54.245 --> 01:05:55.245
It's Laura.

01:05:55.505 --> 01:05:56.285
What?

01:05:56.445 --> 01:05:57.565
She's gone Jack.

01:05:57.885 --> 01:06:00.345
What do you mean she's
gone? What are you on about?

01:06:00.385 --> 01:06:01.825
Listen to me, she's dead.

01:06:02.285 --> 01:06:03.285
What? Who?

01:06:04.445 --> 01:06:05.445
Listen to what I'm telling you.

01:06:06.085 --> 01:06:07.245
She's gone.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:09.325
She's fucking dead!

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:09.965
Laura?

01:06:10.125 --> 01:06:13.423
If we don't get the fuck out of
these woods, we are going to be next!

01:06:13.425 --> 01:06:14.263
Alex you're scaring me.

01:06:14.265 --> 01:06:16.185
Listen to what I am telling you.

01:06:16.765 --> 01:06:18.563
She is gone Jack.

01:06:18.565 --> 01:06:19.065
Where?

01:06:20.205 --> 01:06:21.463
What do you mean?

01:06:21.465 --> 01:06:21.965
Where is she?

01:06:32.305 --> 01:06:33.125
Jack what the fuck!

01:06:43.685 --> 01:06:44.685
Jack stop!

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:57.043
Jack, Jack look at me!

01:06:57.045 --> 01:06:57.965
She's fucking dead!

01:06:58.385 --> 01:07:00.145
Jack look at me, look at me.

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:02.885
If we don't get the fuck out now -

01:07:03.065 --> 01:07:04.705
we're going to be next.

01:07:06.225 --> 01:07:07.105
We need to go.

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:08.525
Leave now.

01:07:09.465 --> 01:07:11.565
Jack we need to get to the car, alright?

01:07:14.045 --> 01:07:14.605
Come on.

01:07:17.045 --> 01:07:18.405
Jack come on!

01:07:20.985 --> 01:07:22.625
Alex wait, what about the others?

01:07:25.445 --> 01:07:27.843
Listen the others will be fine.

01:07:27.845 --> 01:07:30.145
We need to get the fuck out of here now
or we're going to be next. Listen to me!

01:07:31.125 --> 01:07:32.103
They'll be fine, I promise.

01:07:32.105 --> 01:07:33.225
Do you think they're together?

01:07:36.885 --> 01:07:37.885
They'll be fine.

01:07:38.245 --> 01:07:39.765
I promise. Alright?

01:07:40.165 --> 01:07:41.165
Check your phone.

01:07:42.665 --> 01:07:44.505
There is no fucking signal.

01:07:45.425 --> 01:07:46.163
Stacey!!

01:07:46.165 --> 01:07:47.545
Shhh... Shut the fuck up.

01:07:49.805 --> 01:07:50.305
We need to be quiet.

01:07:52.865 --> 01:07:54.105
What the fuck was that?

01:07:58.905 --> 01:07:59.983
Jack we need to go...

01:08:26.024 --> 01:08:27.145
Jack come on!

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:30.165
I can't Alex, I can't...

01:08:30.524 --> 01:08:31.805
What are you doing?

01:08:32.685 --> 01:08:34.843
No listen to me, you need to move
- we need to...

01:08:42.625 --> 01:08:43.125
JACK!!

01:08:54.645 --> 01:08:55.505
Oh fuck!

01:08:56.024 --> 01:08:56.524
Fuck!

01:11:08.885 --> 01:11:09.885
Hello?

01:11:13.705 --> 01:11:15.865
Alex are you there? Hello?

01:11:17.185 --> 01:11:18.205
Dad?

01:11:20.605 --> 01:11:22.685
Alex are you okay?

01:11:24.365 --> 01:11:25.545
I'm alive, I'm just...

01:11:27.605 --> 01:11:29.285
I need help!

01:14:22.865 --> 01:14:23.785
Hello

01:14:29.425 --> 01:14:30.425
Can you help me?

01:14:31.345 --> 01:14:34.783
Oh my dear, oh my goodness!

01:14:34.785 --> 01:14:37.323
What has happened to you?

01:14:37.325 --> 01:14:39.165
Are you okay?

01:14:43.225 --> 01:14:45.465
What has happened?

01:14:46.665 --> 01:14:47.665
There is something out there.

01:14:48.605 --> 01:14:50.425
Out where?

01:14:50.885 --> 01:14:51.885
In the woods?

01:14:54.605 --> 01:14:56.405
My Friends...

01:14:57.585 --> 01:14:58.583
They're dead.

01:14:58.585 --> 01:15:00.085
There's a ghost out there!

01:15:02.845 --> 01:15:04.385
Oh my dear, just calm down.

01:15:06.505 --> 01:15:07.585
What's in the woods?

01:15:09.485 --> 01:15:11.165
Your friends?

01:15:11.825 --> 01:15:13.665
Have you lost your friends?

01:15:13.725 --> 01:15:14.625
No!

01:15:15.405 --> 01:15:19.065
There's something out there!

01:15:19.885 --> 01:15:20.845
They're dead!

01:15:24.925 --> 01:15:26.305
Oh my darling...

01:15:27.825 --> 01:15:29.265
That isn't possible.

01:15:29.645 --> 01:15:32.465
You must be mistaken.

01:15:33.425 --> 01:15:33.985
No...

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:37.765
Why don't I go and get my phone.

01:15:37.925 --> 01:15:39.925
And we'll call the police -

01:15:40.045 --> 01:15:42.285
and get this all cleared up.

01:15:43.645 --> 01:15:45.785
Look, you'll see.

01:15:46.465 --> 01:15:47.965
Nothing to worry about.

01:15:48.165 --> 01:15:49.145
You just wait here.

01:15:49.705 --> 01:15:51.445
And I'll be right back!

01:16:17.925 --> 01:16:19.923
We need to get out of here, now.

01:16:19.925 --> 01:16:20.543
Alright?

01:16:20.545 --> 01:16:21.805
It's coming back!

01:16:23.685 --> 01:16:24.185
No...

01:16:25.125 --> 01:16:28.165
It will be easier for the
police to find us right here.

01:16:28.645 --> 01:16:31.585
We are perfectly safe I promise.

01:16:38.485 --> 01:16:40.805
Don't tell me you didn't hear that?

01:16:42.805 --> 01:16:43.805
I didn't hear anything.

01:16:44.485 --> 01:16:45.485
My dear.

01:16:46.145 --> 01:16:51.545
You're just hearing the trees
that's all, and the dark woods.

01:16:52.245 --> 01:16:54.945
It's making you all upset.

01:16:56.865 --> 01:16:58.863
No, no
- we need to get out here now.

01:16:58.865 --> 01:16:59.745
It's coming!

01:17:01.885 --> 01:17:07.565
Why don't I lock the back
door, make you feel safer?

01:17:13.565 --> 01:17:14.925
Why do you have a key?

01:17:18.785 --> 01:17:22.985
I work here my dear, I help
run all the scout groups.

01:17:25.065 --> 01:17:27.165
The alarm went off a little while back -

01:17:28.025 --> 01:17:31.805
and I came over as fast
as I could to investigate.

01:18:12.965 --> 01:18:15.385
There, we're safe.

01:18:16.105 --> 01:18:20.705
The police will be here soon
- and I am sure that they can sort all this out.

01:18:22.625 --> 01:18:24.145
Can we please leave?

01:18:24.725 --> 01:18:25.805
Don't you have car?

01:18:26.905 --> 01:18:28.385
Are we not near a road?

01:18:28.665 --> 01:18:29.785
I have my own car.

01:18:30.485 --> 01:18:36.305
I do have a car, but I think
it's best if we remain right here.

01:18:38.525 --> 01:18:39.525
Can I get you a drink?

01:18:39.865 --> 01:18:41.565
Would you like to sit down?

01:18:42.925 --> 01:18:43.425
No!

01:18:44.645 --> 01:18:45.685
I want to leave.

01:18:46.985 --> 01:18:48.285
I don't want to stay here.

01:18:57.925 --> 01:18:59.125
That's my phone...

01:19:01.245 --> 01:19:02.245
My dad.

01:19:03.225 --> 01:19:04.505
I dropped my phone.

01:19:05.465 --> 01:19:06.505
I need to get it.

01:19:24.745 --> 01:19:26.665
Why is the other door locked?

01:19:27.385 --> 01:19:29.625
Can you just settle down.

01:19:30.145 --> 01:19:36.765
You'll make this whole process a
lot easier if you just calm down.

01:19:38.405 --> 01:19:39.485
We need to get out of here...

01:19:40.305 --> 01:19:41.405
We're all going to die!

01:19:42.625 --> 01:19:44.505
I don't think so...

01:19:45.245 --> 01:19:50.045
the only person who is going to
die here tonight little one....

01:19:50.945 --> 01:19:51.943
Is

01:19:51.945 --> 01:19:52.945
you

01:19:58.565 --> 01:19:59.565
What?

01:20:00.965 --> 01:20:04.143
You my little one

01:20:04.145 --> 01:20:05.605
will be my final victim.

01:20:06.325 --> 01:20:09.523
Then after all these years

01:20:09.525 --> 01:20:12.405
we can all finally be at peace.

01:20:15.585 --> 01:20:16.585
I don't understand?

01:20:17.325 --> 01:20:18.425
You wouldn't.

01:20:19.185 --> 01:20:20.945
It was a very long time ago.

01:20:21.485 --> 01:20:22.485
So long ago

01:20:22.605 --> 01:20:23.745
You weren't even born.

01:20:27.585 --> 01:20:29.505
My poor girl.

01:20:30.445 --> 01:20:33.445
My sweet, innocent girl

01:20:36.485 --> 01:20:37.485
What girl?

01:20:38.205 --> 01:20:39.645
My girl!

01:20:41.125 --> 01:20:44.685
The one you hear screaming
and bellowing in the woods.

01:20:45.225 --> 01:20:46.545
In pain.

01:20:46.825 --> 01:20:47.825
In purgatory.

01:20:48.825 --> 01:20:49.825
Because of what they did to her.

01:20:50.825 --> 01:20:53.105
Because of what they made her do.

01:20:54.605 --> 01:20:57.683
Please, I haven't done anything.

01:20:57.685 --> 01:20:58.185
No.

01:20:58.765 --> 01:21:00.745
You didn't do anything

01:21:00.765 --> 01:21:02.545
an innocent party I admit.

01:21:03.805 --> 01:21:05.645
But what your parents did.

01:21:06.665 --> 01:21:07.665
My parents?

01:21:09.765 --> 01:21:10.765
No please!

01:21:12.005 --> 01:21:12.985
I don't understand.

01:21:14.265 --> 01:21:16.505
Your parents made her do it.

01:21:19.225 --> 01:21:22.165
I had to watch as my daughter
cried herself to sleep.

01:21:22.945 --> 01:21:26.085
Afraid of the ridicule that
they would bestow upon her.

01:21:33.125 --> 01:21:34.125
I need the keys...

01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:35.265
Now!

01:21:36.145 --> 01:21:39.705
You're not going anywhere!

01:21:40.445 --> 01:21:43.545
Not until I can finally free my daughter

01:21:43.605 --> 01:21:46.265
and her child from their torment.

01:21:47.785 --> 01:21:48.785
Jessica?

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:52.825
The memorial in the woods?

01:21:53.925 --> 01:21:54.925
That's your daughter?

01:21:56.865 --> 01:21:57.865
Suicide.

01:21:59.765 --> 01:22:02.365
The baby in the woods...

01:22:03.545 --> 01:22:04.545
Perished out there

01:22:04.985 --> 01:22:08.425
because of the barbaric things
your parents made her do.

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:12.745
They bullied her, made her feel disgusting.

01:22:15.005 --> 01:22:16.005
One

01:22:16.605 --> 01:22:18.085
silly mistake.

01:22:19.705 --> 01:22:22.345
Just one silly mistake.

01:22:23.125 --> 01:22:26.465
And as the baby grew
inside her the worse it got!

01:22:29.625 --> 01:22:30.625
My parents?

01:22:31.985 --> 01:22:34.485
All of your groups parents.

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:40.043
I have had to live

01:22:40.045 --> 01:22:42.065
with the pain, anger

01:22:43.085 --> 01:22:45.225
devastation of that day

01:22:46.185 --> 01:22:47.185
ever since.

01:22:50.005 --> 01:22:52.345
Your parents got to grow up

01:22:52.745 --> 01:22:53.745
Have lives

01:22:55.405 --> 01:22:56.125
Families.

01:22:57.285 --> 01:22:58.285
Joy.

01:23:00.445 --> 01:23:03.585
All the things my Jessica
should have been doing.

01:23:07.145 --> 01:23:09.365
They moved on with their lives.

01:23:10.425 --> 01:23:11.425
Whilst

01:23:11.845 --> 01:23:12.845
I

01:23:14.045 --> 01:23:15.585
wallowed in darkness.

01:23:19.905 --> 01:23:21.525
I saw my Jessica you know?

01:23:23.325 --> 01:23:24.325
And I realised that

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:25.625
she was trapped here.

01:23:28.505 --> 01:23:31.905
And I realised what I had to do.

01:23:33.865 --> 01:23:35.505
The only thing I could do.

01:23:36.865 --> 01:23:38.145
Give that

01:23:38.725 --> 01:23:41.485
same pain and hurt

01:23:42.485 --> 01:23:44.705
to those who had wronged her.

01:23:49.005 --> 01:23:50.003
Killing them

01:23:50.005 --> 01:23:52.645
would have been too easy.

01:23:54.125 --> 01:23:56.225
But taking away their children.

01:23:57.565 --> 01:24:04.545
Making them feel the pain and hurt
that I have felt all these years.

01:24:07.165 --> 01:24:08.165
That

01:24:08.385 --> 01:24:11.463
would finally have allowed

01:24:11.465 --> 01:24:14.925
my daughter and her child to rest in peace.

01:24:15.585 --> 01:24:17.465
You let her kill all my friends?

01:24:18.045 --> 01:24:19.485
And now you want to try and kill me?

01:24:20.045 --> 01:24:21.325
That won't free her

01:24:21.885 --> 01:24:22.885
That won't change anything.

01:24:23.585 --> 01:24:24.585
You're fucking insane!

01:24:26.565 --> 01:24:27.965
Don't be ridiculous

01:24:29.025 --> 01:24:32.145
My daughter is but screams in the night.

01:24:34.605 --> 01:24:35.925
I killed your friends.

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:38.285
and now...

01:24:39.145 --> 01:24:41.465
I am going to kill you!

01:24:43.365 --> 01:24:44.365
I've seen her.

01:24:46.165 --> 01:24:47.165
Seen who?

01:24:48.225 --> 01:24:49.225
Your daughter.

01:24:49.845 --> 01:24:51.185
The girl dressed in grey.

01:24:52.005 --> 01:24:53.145
Impossible!

01:24:54.305 --> 01:24:56.205
She dragged Jack off into the darkness.

01:24:57.165 --> 01:24:58.165
I saw her do it!

01:25:01.065 --> 01:25:03.725
You saw my daughter?

01:25:05.625 --> 01:25:07.565
Then she's here

01:25:09.265 --> 01:25:10.065
fully here.

01:25:10.965 --> 01:25:16.065
Helping me, helping
herself to finally be free.

01:25:16.325 --> 01:25:17.983
You are killing people.

01:25:17.985 --> 01:25:20.865
How do you think that's going to
bring anything other than more pain?

01:25:21.585 --> 01:25:23.745
We'll soon find out!

01:25:26.225 --> 01:25:28.265
Then you'll have to catch me first.

01:25:43.925 --> 01:25:44.425
Fuck!

01:25:46.185 --> 01:25:47.965
Soon my little girl...

01:25:50.745 --> 01:25:51.745
soon.

01:25:55.665 --> 01:25:56.665
Come on.

01:25:57.645 --> 01:26:00.645
It's time to give it all up.

01:26:00.985 --> 01:26:02.645
Embrace your destiny.

01:26:03.805 --> 01:26:05.505
End this cycle.

01:26:06.485 --> 01:26:07.585
If you want to kill me -

01:26:08.905 --> 01:26:10.025
you're going to have to fight me.

01:26:12.545 --> 01:26:14.285
It won't take long!

01:26:25.745 --> 01:26:27.265
NO!

01:26:31.985 --> 01:26:36.005
Jessica, my baby.

01:26:36.905 --> 01:26:38.745
You've come.

01:26:41.965 --> 01:26:44.905
Let me finally end this boy.

01:26:45.825 --> 01:26:47.345
It's time!

01:27:13.585 --> 01:27:15.103
No!

01:27:15.105 --> 01:27:16.825
Stop the killing.

01:27:18.705 --> 01:27:19.705
Jessica?

01:27:20.925 --> 01:27:22.445
My darling.

01:27:24.925 --> 01:27:27.145
Stop this now!

01:27:29.485 --> 01:27:31.905
You blame others for my suicide.

01:27:32.105 --> 01:27:33.385
But it was my choice.

01:27:34.365 --> 01:27:35.945
They all wronged me.

01:27:35.985 --> 01:27:38.865
But you are no innocent mother.

01:27:39.805 --> 01:27:41.623
That night when you banished me.

01:27:41.625 --> 01:27:42.945
From my own home.

01:27:43.765 --> 01:27:46.025
You told me I wasn't your daughter.

01:27:46.885 --> 01:27:49.885
You looked at your grandchild with disgust.

01:27:51.645 --> 01:27:53.045
I needed you.

01:27:54.345 --> 01:27:56.985
You were just as much to blame.

01:27:58.325 --> 01:28:01.605
You turned your back on me
when I needed you the most.

01:28:02.485 --> 01:28:02.985
No...

01:28:04.105 --> 01:28:05.105
No Jessica.

01:28:06.005 --> 01:28:07.085
I was upset.

01:28:09.065 --> 01:28:09.965
You were so young.

01:28:11.205 --> 01:28:14.205
And I knew how hard it was to be a mother!

01:28:16.225 --> 01:28:16.725
And.

01:28:17.765 --> 01:28:23.585
All the things people were saying
about you, about our family.

01:28:24.085 --> 01:28:26.825
You banished me through fear of others.

01:28:28.005 --> 01:28:30.565
And then through your own
darkness trapped me here!

01:28:32.145 --> 01:28:33.625
My darkness?

01:28:35.045 --> 01:28:38.043
You plotted this for 25 years.

01:28:38.045 --> 01:28:42.245
How could I rest knowing
the pain you would cause?

01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:45.925
The darkness grew inside you every day.

01:28:47.285 --> 01:28:47.785
But...

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:51.485
You helped me?

01:28:52.145 --> 01:28:55.585
Your presence was always near, I felt it.

01:28:57.105 --> 01:29:00.765
With each of the ones I
killed I felt you there.

01:29:03.565 --> 01:29:08.163
This boy told me that you took one of his
friends and that you wanted me to do this!

01:29:08.165 --> 01:29:09.023
No!

01:29:09.025 --> 01:29:13.365
I tried to warn those
that you tried to harm.

01:29:13.645 --> 01:29:14.645
Hello?

01:29:14.925 --> 01:29:15.965
You okay?

01:29:16.505 --> 01:29:19.145
Get away from the house!

01:29:23.325 --> 01:29:26.005
They're coming for you!

01:29:27.105 --> 01:29:28.105
Stacey?

01:29:29.265 --> 01:29:29.785
Stace?

01:29:29.925 --> 01:29:31.445
Get out of the woods!

01:29:34.525 --> 01:29:36.765
I warned them!

01:29:37.885 --> 01:29:39.245
I don't believe you.

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:43.345
No, you were helping me make
them pay for what they did.

01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:45.545
What they did?

01:29:45.885 --> 01:29:46.885
You did!

01:29:47.465 --> 01:29:50.245
Easing your conscience.

01:29:50.665 --> 01:29:51.985
You are wrong!

01:29:53.225 --> 01:29:54.825
You are not my daughter.

01:29:55.345 --> 01:29:58.805
If you were, you would understand my pain.

01:30:00.285 --> 01:30:02.605
I will finish what I have started!!

01:30:16.485 --> 01:30:17.485
Alex!

01:30:30.305 --> 01:30:35.705
I'm taking you to hell mother!!

01:31:00.085 --> 01:31:00.905
Alex!

01:31:02.405 --> 01:31:03.605
Alex are you okay?

01:31:04.205 --> 01:31:05.085
My stomach...

01:31:05.405 --> 01:31:05.905
Fuck!

01:32:19.345 --> 01:32:24.505
Jack wake up, it's camping day, so get
up, get ready and we'll go and get pissed.

01:32:26.725 --> 01:32:33.323
This is going to be fun, just so you know I'm planning on
drinking about 60% of all the alcohol we brought with us.

01:32:33.325 --> 01:32:38.123
25 Years ago there was young teenage girl
called Jessica. Who got pregnant and had a baby.

01:32:38.125 --> 01:32:44.403
She was bullied by the kids at her school and in the
neighbourhood and one day, just a few days after giving birth

01:32:44.405 --> 01:32:48.765
she snapped and ran away. She ran into the woods,
these woods to be precise and hanged herself.

01:32:49.345 --> 01:32:51.365
Are you enjoying your time in the woods?
