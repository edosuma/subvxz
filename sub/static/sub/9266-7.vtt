00:00.065 --> 00:01.698
Kissing you was great.

00:01.733 --> 00:02.900
- Uh
-huh.

00:02.934 --> 00:04.435
There's this part of me

00:04.469 --> 00:07.838
That's still hung up on this other girl.

00:07.873 --> 00:09.607
Touchdown, east dillon!

00:09.641 --> 00:12.343
Looks like the lions may
have found a quarterback

00:12.377 --> 00:14.378
That is the real deal.

00:14.412 --> 00:15.779
Maybe I should have left already.

00:15.814 --> 00:17.014
Do you even want me to stay?

00:17.048 --> 00:19.016
Of course I want you to stay!

00:19.050 --> 00:21.685
He's leaving. He's really leaving.

[whispering] hey.

00:44.376 --> 00:46.677
I'm trying to hear if she's still crying.

00:46.711 --> 00:47.845
Take her.

00:47.879 --> 00:49.680
[whispering] he'll call eventually.

00:49.714 --> 00:52.983
He hasn't called yet.

00:53.018 --> 00:56.654
- You want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

00:56.688 --> 00:58.589
Hi, sweetie.

00:58.623 --> 01:01.525
- Hey.
- How you doing?

01:01.560 --> 01:03.194
Fine.

01:05.597 --> 01:06.697
Go, cattle, go, cattle!

01:06.731 --> 01:09.867
Sook, sook, whoop! Hup, hup!

01:09.901 --> 01:11.869
We'll be all right, maggie.
Yep! Get up, cow!

01:11.903 --> 01:14.371
They can't get out, they can't get stolen.

01:14.406 --> 01:16.373
What kind of an idiot
would steal these cows?

01:16.408 --> 01:18.442
- Cow rustlers.
- Cow rustlers?

01:18.476 --> 01:20.344
What is this, the wild west? This sucks.

01:20.378 --> 01:23.180
Luke, don't say sucks. Have a vocabulary.

01:23.215 --> 01:24.949
I'm sorry, mom.

01:24.983 --> 01:26.016
Luke and I'll get that fence fixed.

01:26.051 --> 01:27.384
We'll be fine. [whistles]

01:27.419 --> 01:29.687
Luke, you'd best plan on
missing some school this week.

01:29.721 --> 01:31.288
You want me to miss school for a week

01:31.323 --> 01:33.057
'cause some idiot's been
stealing our cows, dad?

01:33.091 --> 01:34.491
I got to go to school.

01:34.526 --> 01:36.293
If I don't go to school,
they won't let me practice.

01:36.328 --> 01:38.762
We got a huge game coming up.
I got to practice.

01:38.797 --> 01:40.197
We can win this game.

01:40.232 --> 01:42.066
I'd hire someone if I could, luke.

01:42.100 --> 01:45.569
We don't have any money.
What do you want me to say?

01:45.604 --> 01:47.104
Yah!

01:47.138 --> 01:49.306
Go. [whistles]

01:49.341 --> 01:50.975
You saw, yeah?

01:51.009 --> 01:53.344
[laughs] wait, shh, shh, shh.

01:53.378 --> 01:55.746
- What's going on?
- Nothing is going on...

01:55.780 --> 01:58.749
Except for the fact that you
won us a blue ribbon award

01:58.783 --> 02:00.618
For academic excellence!

02:00.652 --> 02:03.120
[cheers and applause]

02:03.154 --> 02:05.656
- Congratulations, tami.
- Take a look.

02:05.690 --> 02:06.890
Tami, one year as principal,

02:06.925 --> 02:08.826
And you got dillon the blue ribbon award.

02:08.860 --> 02:09.893
Incredible.

02:09.928 --> 02:12.162
Dillon high is a blue ribbon school.

02:12.197 --> 02:14.498
This is great news!

02:14.532 --> 02:16.033
How about that? - It's yours!

02:16.067 --> 02:17.434
[applause]

02:17.469 --> 02:20.604
He's here, he's here, he's here!

02:22.807 --> 02:25.643
Daddy!

02:25.677 --> 02:27.211
Ha ha!

02:27.245 --> 02:29.280
[laughs] oh, he's cute!

02:29.314 --> 02:31.115
Hey.

02:31.149 --> 02:32.950
- I missed you.
- Look at you!

02:32.984 --> 02:35.552
Look the hell at you! Stop growing up.

02:35.587 --> 02:37.321
Oh, well, there's not
much I can do about that.

02:37.355 --> 02:39.356
- Hey.
- Hey, cheryl.

02:39.391 --> 02:40.691
Put your stuff in the guest room.

02:40.725 --> 02:41.892
I rented out the airstream.

02:41.926 --> 02:43.260
You all set? You got to go to school.

02:43.295 --> 02:45.062
I've been driving all night.
I'll take her.

02:45.096 --> 02:46.664
Well, you know what?
We got all her stuff ready.

02:46.698 --> 02:48.832
Go settle in. You'll see her later.

02:48.867 --> 02:50.200
Come on, becky. - All right. [chuckles]

02:50.235 --> 02:52.403
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

02:53.905 --> 02:55.706

03:13.658 --> 03:16.160
Come on, let's go.

03:16.194 --> 03:18.362
Hey, listen now.

03:18.396 --> 03:21.465
Campo park--two weeks.

03:21.499 --> 03:24.034
This is a game we are gonna win.

03:24.069 --> 03:25.569
And I'll tell you something,

03:25.603 --> 03:29.340
We're gonna be going into this
game a little bit different.

03:32.310 --> 03:34.945
You've got about 30 seconds

03:34.979 --> 03:36.447
Before this gentleman puts on that uniform

03:36.481 --> 03:37.848
And get some licks on him,

03:37.882 --> 03:39.883
'cause you're looking
at our new quarterback.

03:39.918 --> 03:42.853
[all cheering]

03:44.723 --> 03:47.925
Let's go. We got work to do!

04:38.076 --> 04:39.443
Um, julie may I ask...

04:39.477 --> 04:41.078
Why you are signing up

04:41.112 --> 04:43.380
For every club that is available?

04:43.415 --> 04:45.048
'cause I can.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.383
You're really signing up

04:46.418 --> 04:48.118
For the school beautification committee?

04:48.153 --> 04:49.920
And you're signing up for the book club,

04:49.954 --> 04:51.422
Which would normally be fine,

04:51.456 --> 04:54.124
<i>Except for this week's
book is twilight.</i>

04:54.159 --> 04:56.293
Just leave me alone, okay?

04:56.327 --> 04:59.496
You do realize that he was
my best friend too, you know?

04:59.531 --> 05:01.632
Yep. And that's why I signed you up

05:01.666 --> 05:03.634
For the academic smackdown.

05:03.668 --> 05:06.403
- What is that?
- It's like quiz bowl.

05:06.438 --> 05:09.039
It's after school.
I'll see you in the cafeteria.

05:11.476 --> 05:12.943
Right. Well, I--

05:12.977 --> 05:15.412
Yeah. We got the invoice two days ago.

05:15.447 --> 05:17.347
Well, I can't pay the invoice a week ago

05:17.382 --> 05:19.349
If I just got it two days ago.

05:19.384 --> 05:20.884
Hang on one second, would you, please?

05:20.919 --> 05:22.686
Come here.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.955
You were absent today.
You can't go to practice.

05:24.989 --> 05:26.323
You got a good excuse? - Yes, sir.

05:26.357 --> 05:28.358
My dad's making me fix our fence at home.

05:28.393 --> 05:29.827
- You have to fix a fence?
- Yeah.

05:29.861 --> 05:32.162
- Are you kidding with me?
- We don't have any money.

05:32.197 --> 05:34.598
We can't hire nobody.
Can I tell you something?

05:34.632 --> 05:36.633
We need you. You understand that?

05:36.668 --> 05:38.335
You're absent, you can't come to practice.

05:38.369 --> 05:40.304
You can't come to practice,
you're not playing.

05:40.338 --> 05:42.606
So here's what you need to do.
You need to fix your fence.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.374
You can fix it in the middle
of the night--I don't care.

05:44.409 --> 05:46.210
You can fix it in the morning
before you come to school.

05:46.244 --> 05:48.111
But you make it to school on time.

05:48.146 --> 05:50.013
You get here on time. You go to practice.

05:50.048 --> 05:52.049
- Okay.
- Good. I'll see you tomorrow.

05:52.083 --> 05:53.684
Don't be absent again.

05:53.718 --> 05:55.819
Go.

05:55.854 --> 05:57.321
Hey, you there?

05:57.355 --> 05:59.990
Yeah, listen, we just
got the invoice, though.

[horns honking]

06:01.826 --> 06:03.694
Hey, move that piece already!

06:03.728 --> 06:05.395
- Calm down!
- Hey! Stop.

06:05.430 --> 06:07.564
- What?
- I got a buck.

06:07.599 --> 06:09.900
Sorry...Funding right now.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.869
Billy I need more. One sec.

06:11.903 --> 06:13.737
God, the baby's-- baby on board.

06:13.771 --> 06:15.506
$1.75.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.875
It's that simple. - I got it, 37 cents.

06:17.909 --> 06:18.876
- Oh, god!
- What?

06:18.910 --> 06:21.044
- No, please stop.
- Calm down!

06:21.079 --> 06:22.679
What is wrong with you? - Contraction.

06:22.714 --> 06:24.848
Oh, god! - Still not there? What?

06:24.883 --> 06:26.850
- Contraction.
- You're seven months pregnant.

06:26.885 --> 06:28.485
You're not contracting.
Please go to the hospital.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.720
- We got food right here--
- oh!

06:29.754 --> 06:31.522
Oh, god. Please go.

06:31.556 --> 06:33.156
- Get the food.
- Oh, god!

06:33.191 --> 06:34.691

06:34.726 --> 06:38.495
Go, go, go, go, go!

06:38.530 --> 06:39.830
Uh! Oh...

06:39.864 --> 06:41.865
- You okay?
- Oh, god!

06:41.900 --> 06:43.267
Do you have any idea

06:43.301 --> 06:46.837
What kind of losers are gonna
be at academic smackdown?

06:46.871 --> 06:50.007
You realize the irony behind
the term academic smackdown?

06:50.041 --> 06:53.076
Shut up, landry.

06:57.649 --> 06:58.615
Hey.

06:58.650 --> 07:00.083
[mutters] goody.

07:00.118 --> 07:02.419
Is this one taken here?

07:05.056 --> 07:06.957
Fancy seeing you here.

07:06.991 --> 07:10.360
This isn't gonna be awkward
or anything, is it?

07:10.395 --> 07:13.430
Well, if it's gonna be
awkward for you, you can leave.

07:13.464 --> 07:15.299
I do this smackdown every single year,

07:15.333 --> 07:18.569
So you being here is of
no consequence to me.

07:19.971 --> 07:21.638
Hey.

07:21.673 --> 07:25.909
Welcome to east dillon
academic smackdown team...

07:25.944 --> 07:27.744
Who have an event this weekend

07:27.779 --> 07:30.080
Against another school in our district

07:30.114 --> 07:33.417
At west dillon, our sister school,

07:33.451 --> 07:35.886
Our blue ribbon sister school.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.388
I need you to perform well at this.

07:38.423 --> 07:40.223
All right, study.

07:40.258 --> 07:42.726
This is exciting.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.095
Learning...

07:45.129 --> 07:47.464
[dogs barking, whining]

07:47.498 --> 07:50.467
Your mom is gonna kill me.

07:50.501 --> 07:52.803
Well, what's she gonna do, divorce you?

07:52.837 --> 07:55.472
Oh, wait. She already did that.

07:55.506 --> 07:57.608
A dog's a lot of work, beck.

07:57.642 --> 07:59.676
A lot of work. - I know.

07:59.711 --> 08:01.011
I can do it.

08:01.045 --> 08:04.681
Besides, I get really
lonely when mom's at work.

08:04.716 --> 08:08.151
Do you ever think you're gonna move home?

08:08.186 --> 08:11.154
I mean, I know you and mom
aren't gonna get back together,

08:11.189 --> 08:15.025
But if you lived in town,
we could see each other more.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.693
Give me a little time, all right?

08:16.728 --> 08:19.363
I'm working on it.

08:19.397 --> 08:20.831
Puppies!

08:20.865 --> 08:23.800
I like this one. [dog whining]

08:25.303 --> 08:27.571
- He's gonna do 50 sit-ups in 30 seconds.

08:27.605 --> 08:29.506
Hit the floor. Let's go.
You're challenging me.

08:29.540 --> 08:32.643
Yeah. Let's go. You ready?

08:32.677 --> 08:35.245
- You ready?
- Go.

08:47.825 --> 08:49.526
Coach.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.861
Hey, levi--

08:50.895 --> 08:52.996
Hey.

08:53.031 --> 08:56.033
- Gentlemen.
- We need to see vincent howard.

08:56.067 --> 08:57.701
What's going on?

08:57.735 --> 09:00.003
We got a report that he
had a gun on school grounds.

09:00.038 --> 09:01.938
These officers need to search his locker.

09:01.973 --> 09:03.507
Report from who?

09:03.541 --> 09:06.276
We need to check the locker.

09:06.310 --> 09:07.878
Well, look, maybe we should, uh...

09:07.912 --> 09:09.179
- Coach...
- Clear something--

09:09.213 --> 09:12.249
The police are here.

09:18.456 --> 09:21.892
Second one on the end.

09:23.461 --> 09:25.896
It's got a name on it.

09:55.093 --> 09:58.261
- It's clean.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

09:58.296 --> 10:01.798
I'll meet you in front.

10:16.247 --> 10:18.648
All right, dad, I'll be back later.

10:18.683 --> 10:20.484
- Where you going?
- School, dad.

10:20.518 --> 10:21.651
I'm going to school.

10:21.686 --> 10:23.286
Luke, get back here.

10:23.321 --> 10:26.256
Dad, I cannot miss practice.

10:26.290 --> 10:27.891
I cannot miss school.
I will build your fence.

10:27.925 --> 10:29.726
I'll stay up till midnight.
I will get up at dawn.

10:29.761 --> 10:31.995
But I'm going to school.

10:32.029 --> 10:34.931
Luke, you get your ass back here now.

10:34.966 --> 10:38.502
I'll be back later, dad.

10:38.536 --> 10:40.804
[softly] son of a bitch.

10:40.838 --> 10:43.006
I want to admit you to
the hospital overnight.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.775
She needs to be on the magnesium sulfate

10:44.809 --> 10:46.977
For at least 24 hours.

10:47.011 --> 10:48.678
Everything's gonna be okay, right?

10:48.713 --> 10:51.081
I mean, the baby and everything.
She's gonna be fine.

10:51.115 --> 10:54.351
It should be, but she's going
to need to go on bed rest.

10:54.385 --> 10:55.519
Okay, um...

10:55.553 --> 10:57.487
For how long? - For two months.

10:57.522 --> 10:58.855
Until the baby's full-term.

10:58.890 --> 11:02.259
I'll check back with you later.

11:02.293 --> 11:04.094
Oh, my god.

11:04.128 --> 11:06.530
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

11:06.564 --> 11:08.198
You aren't gonna have to do anything.

11:08.232 --> 11:10.033
Me and tim are gonna
take care of everything.

11:10.067 --> 11:13.503
You won't have to lift a finger, all right?

11:13.538 --> 11:15.639
Uh, doc? Doc.

11:15.673 --> 11:17.874
Uh, look...

11:17.909 --> 11:20.043
I don't exactly have insurance right now.

11:20.077 --> 11:23.346
I mean, I was--I was gonna pay
for the birth out of pocket,

11:23.381 --> 11:26.683
But, uh, I wasn't exactly
expecting it to cost this much.

11:26.717 --> 11:28.685
Is there anything...

11:28.719 --> 11:32.289
We might be able to work out
or some kind of deal or...?

11:32.323 --> 11:35.358
Uh, you know, it-- it costs what it costs.

11:35.393 --> 11:39.029
There are payment plans, but still...

11:39.063 --> 11:40.630
The contractions are waning.

11:40.665 --> 11:42.666
You can take her home
and keep her on her side

11:42.700 --> 11:44.167
And well-hydrated.

11:44.202 --> 11:46.269
It may be enough.

11:46.304 --> 11:50.340
Then, um...We'll keep her here overnight.

11:50.374 --> 11:52.075
Uh, you know, premature labor

11:52.109 --> 11:54.878
Is something that usually
happens more than once.

11:54.912 --> 11:56.813
Okay? - Yeah.

11:59.617 --> 12:01.251
What am I supposed to do? It's the police.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.286
It's not like I have
much of a choice anyway.

12:03.321 --> 12:05.355
No...I mean, I guess not.
I mean, I don't know.

12:05.389 --> 12:07.524
You know, if they'd come in saying...

12:07.558 --> 12:08.658
Open up landry's locker,

12:08.693 --> 12:10.427
Would you have just done that?

12:10.461 --> 12:12.762
I don't know what I would have done then.

12:12.797 --> 12:15.432
I think the real question is
do you think that he has a gun?

12:15.466 --> 12:17.467
Well, I sure as hell hope not.

12:17.501 --> 12:20.003
But do you think it's possible?

12:20.037 --> 12:23.373
I-I don't know, honey.
Anything's possible, isn't it?

12:23.407 --> 12:25.709
Seems like maybe you
ought to just ask him.

12:25.743 --> 12:27.944
I mean, he's never gonna trust
you unless you trust him.

12:27.979 --> 12:29.579
You know what I mean?

12:32.083 --> 12:33.950
Okay.

12:33.985 --> 12:36.019
What year was the battle of stalingrad?

12:36.053 --> 12:37.821
19...1941.

12:37.855 --> 12:39.990
- Wrong.
- 1942.

12:40.024 --> 12:42.158
- Thank you.
- Can you lighten up?

12:42.193 --> 12:43.960
Jeez, you're making me go blank.

12:43.995 --> 12:45.028
I'm making you go blank?

12:45.062 --> 12:46.496
How do you think you're gonna feel

12:46.530 --> 12:48.732
When you're having to answer these questions

12:48.766 --> 12:50.834
In front of all those people? - Shh!

12:50.868 --> 12:52.535
Hey, julie. Hey, come here.
Hey, come here.

12:52.570 --> 12:54.070
These are very basic
questions I'm asking right now.

12:54.105 --> 12:55.705
Julie, come here and let
me tell you something.

12:55.740 --> 12:57.407
What? He knows nothing about world war ii!

12:57.441 --> 12:59.309
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come here, come here.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.343
What?

13:00.378 --> 13:02.812
Take a deep breath, okay?

13:02.847 --> 13:04.781
I understand that you're
going through a lot,

13:04.815 --> 13:06.349
That you're in a lot of pain--

13:06.384 --> 13:07.751
This has nothing to do with matt.

13:07.785 --> 13:10.353
I want to do well on the smackdown, okay?

13:10.388 --> 13:11.888
- You know what? Just--
- you're lying, it's about matt.

13:11.923 --> 13:13.790
Just climb off my back,
okay? It's not about matt.

13:13.824 --> 13:16.092
Just deal with the fact that it's about--

13:20.231 --> 13:21.865
Vince.

13:21.899 --> 13:24.367
Come here.

13:26.137 --> 13:29.639
Close the door.

13:29.674 --> 13:32.809
Sit down. - What's up?

13:37.415 --> 13:39.582
How you doing?

13:39.617 --> 13:40.884
I'm good.

13:40.918 --> 13:44.187
A little sore, but I'm good.

13:44.221 --> 13:46.356
I got to ask you a question.

13:52.363 --> 13:54.764
You got a gun?

13:56.968 --> 14:00.704
I'm just asking you straight up.
Have you got a gun?

14:00.738 --> 14:02.539
Do you have gun, do you carry a gun,

14:02.573 --> 14:03.940
Do you have a gun in your locker,

14:03.975 --> 14:05.775
Do you have a gun on the
premises--I don't know.

14:05.810 --> 14:08.845
A gun. Give me an answer. Talk to me.

14:10.982 --> 14:12.282
No.

14:12.316 --> 14:15.185
No, I ain't got no gun.

14:19.256 --> 14:21.424
That's all I wanted to know.

14:24.662 --> 14:28.498
I don't know.
Do the swaddle-and-shush thing.

14:28.532 --> 14:31.601
Babe, I don't know.
I'm not a friggin' midwife.

14:31.635 --> 14:33.236
So I don't know.

14:33.270 --> 14:35.472
I'll be home in a few days, all right?

14:35.506 --> 14:38.108
Then I'm yours. Yeah, yours and the baby's.

14:38.142 --> 14:39.576
All right, yeah.

14:39.610 --> 14:42.779
Love--love you back.

14:42.813 --> 14:45.749
Trouble at home, huh?

14:45.783 --> 14:48.518
Uh... Becky says you were, uh,

14:48.552 --> 14:51.121
Some kind of big football deal around here.

14:51.155 --> 14:52.956
Is that it? - Something like that.

14:52.990 --> 14:55.158
Yeah. I bet that was
pretty good times, huh?

14:55.192 --> 14:56.993
Yeah, it had its moments.

14:57.028 --> 14:58.862
[laughs] you're young yet. It'll change.

14:58.896 --> 15:00.730
Believe me. You're not married, are you?

15:00.765 --> 15:03.466
- - Don't ever get married.

15:03.501 --> 15:05.068
Don't ever have kids.

15:05.102 --> 15:08.371
You don't like your kids?

15:08.406 --> 15:10.407
No, I love my kids.

15:10.441 --> 15:12.909
It's just that it-- it never ends.

15:12.943 --> 15:16.079
Right. I mean... A baby and all.

15:16.113 --> 15:18.281
I'm sure it's a lot.

15:20.117 --> 15:21.551
All right, look,

15:21.585 --> 15:24.154
I got a baby with this girl in seattle.

15:24.188 --> 15:26.623
You know how it goes, right? - Hmm.

15:26.657 --> 15:28.391
Now she wants to get married.

15:28.426 --> 15:30.126
There's just never enough to go around.

15:30.161 --> 15:33.096
Yeah. You're spreading
yourself pretty thin.

15:33.130 --> 15:35.498
Becky know about seattle? - Oh, no, no.

15:35.533 --> 15:38.768
No. No. And I don't want her to.

15:38.803 --> 15:40.336
It was a present!

15:40.371 --> 15:42.872
Forget it! I'm walking!

15:42.907 --> 15:44.841
I'm not going anywhere with you!

15:44.875 --> 15:46.643
Becky, you are being ridiculous.

15:46.677 --> 15:48.678
- Cheryl, what the hell--
- you've got one hell of a nerve

15:48.712 --> 15:50.346
Bringing that dog in here without asking.

15:50.381 --> 15:52.248
There's nothing wrong with
her having a little dog.

16:18.676 --> 16:20.443
Julie.

16:20.478 --> 16:23.279
Julie taylor. - Hey, mrs. Saracen.

16:23.314 --> 16:26.683
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Come in here, sweetie.

16:26.717 --> 16:28.585
Shelby, look who's here. It's julie.

16:28.619 --> 16:29.686
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.788
Oh, it's so good to see you.

16:31.822 --> 16:33.656
- How you doing?
- Good.

16:33.691 --> 16:35.959
Well, we're doing just fine, honey.

16:35.993 --> 16:39.062
Shelby here, she's taking
real good care of me.

16:39.096 --> 16:40.964
Well, I'm trying.

16:40.998 --> 16:42.432
That's good to hear.

16:42.466 --> 16:46.369
I'm sure this whole matt
thing must be so hard on you.

16:46.403 --> 16:48.671
Oh, lord, julie, at first...

16:48.706 --> 16:50.673
It was just awful.

16:50.708 --> 16:53.009
But, you know, now that I know he's fine,

16:53.043 --> 16:55.845
Then I'm fine.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.714
- You talked to matt?
- Oh, yeah.

16:57.748 --> 16:59.616
He even called again yesterday,
bless his heart,

16:59.650 --> 17:01.284
And let us know he got the place.

17:01.318 --> 17:03.319
He told you, I'm sure.

17:03.354 --> 17:06.489
Yeah, he did.

17:06.523 --> 17:08.157
Well, you know what?

17:08.192 --> 17:10.926
We were just about to have
an ice cream sandwich.

17:10.961 --> 17:12.162
Let me get you one.

17:12.195 --> 17:13.796
[whispering] hey.

17:13.830 --> 17:16.232
He's just going through a lot, you know?

17:16.267 --> 17:19.435
He'll call. He'll be in touch soon.

17:31.749 --> 17:33.716
[dance music plays]

17:33.751 --> 17:37.353
* *

17:37.388 --> 17:39.355
You're broke. I'm broke.

17:39.390 --> 17:41.491
We got to sell something.
What do we have to sell, tim?

17:41.525 --> 17:43.993
We don't have anything
to sell besides kit kat.

17:44.028 --> 17:46.529
No. We're not selling kit kat.
He's the face of riggins' rigs.

17:46.564 --> 17:47.764
You're right. You're right.

17:47.798 --> 17:49.365
I love that damn cow.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.467
Cheers, boys. Couple beers on me.

17:51.502 --> 17:53.603
- Thank you, thank you.
- How's my girl doing?

17:53.637 --> 17:55.138
She's doing good. She's doing better.

17:55.172 --> 17:57.273
I mean, her mom's taking
care of her right now,

17:57.308 --> 17:58.541
Give tim and I a little break

17:58.576 --> 18:00.810
From the ringing of the
bell every five seconds.

18:00.844 --> 18:02.145
That bell...

18:02.179 --> 18:04.013
What? I don't want her
to stress out about things.

18:04.048 --> 18:05.448
Hey, me and the girls been talking,

18:05.482 --> 18:07.951
And we want to throw mindy a baby shower.

18:07.985 --> 18:09.452
- Oh, that's really nice.
- Sweet.

18:09.486 --> 18:11.254
Okay, but we also want
to tie in a fundraiser.

18:11.288 --> 18:15.124
Make it a co-ed shower,
girls dance and whatnot,

18:15.159 --> 18:17.327
Guys pay admission and whatnot.

18:17.361 --> 18:20.430
All the proceeds go to help mindy, baby,

18:20.464 --> 18:22.765
And all the medical bills.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.934
- Yeah. No, I-I like this.

18:24.969 --> 18:27.237
I mean, mindy and I have been
friends since she was 17, okay?

18:27.271 --> 18:29.472
She's like a sister to me.
I want to do this.

18:29.506 --> 18:31.774
Where--where would we do it, though?

18:31.809 --> 18:34.277
- Your place isn't big enough?
- Not for something like thi

18:34.311 --> 18:35.845
- I can't host it.
- No, he can't host it.

18:35.879 --> 18:40.116
He lives in a trailer.
[chuckles] uh, yeah...

18:40.150 --> 18:42.252
What about...? - Riggins' rigs.

18:42.286 --> 18:44.087
That may be the smartest thing

18:44.121 --> 18:45.655
You've ever said in your whole entire life.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.957
- That could work.
- Riggins' rigs.

18:47.992 --> 18:49.158
- Sounds like a plan, okay?
- Yeah.

18:49.193 --> 18:50.460
- Enjoy the beers.
- Thank you.

18:50.494 --> 18:52.028
Thank you. Great call.

18:52.062 --> 18:53.763
- Thank you, hannah!
- Yeah.

18:53.797 --> 18:55.431
What about stephen crane?

18:55.466 --> 18:57.800
Does anybody need to read
stephen crane anymore?

18:57.835 --> 18:59.802
You know, I think we can
do without stephen crane,

18:59.837 --> 19:01.537
Go on to something a little fresher.

19:01.572 --> 19:03.206
- Okay.
- Did you, uh, get a chance

19:03.240 --> 19:05.308
To go out and celebrate last night?

19:05.342 --> 19:07.810
Um...Well, we kind of did.

19:07.845 --> 19:08.878
Kind of?

19:08.912 --> 19:10.913
We had a little dinner last night.

19:10.948 --> 19:13.850
There's a lot going on in
my house at the moment.

19:13.884 --> 19:15.051
There's a lot going on, so it was...

19:15.085 --> 19:16.486
Sort of a celebration.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.655
Well, you know, I mean,
this is kind of a big deal.

19:18.689 --> 19:20.790
You know, you ought to take a
night for yourself, go out,

19:20.824 --> 19:22.492
You know, cut it loose.

19:22.526 --> 19:23.960
How about this?

19:23.994 --> 19:25.295
What would you think

19:25.329 --> 19:27.630
If I got a group of the teachers together,

19:27.665 --> 19:30.333
Some of the staff, and all of us together--

19:30.367 --> 19:32.168
We went out, and we celebrated you

19:32.202 --> 19:33.736
And your accomplishment?

19:33.771 --> 19:35.338
I think that would be so much fun.

19:35.372 --> 19:36.873
It doesn't have to be about me.

19:36.907 --> 19:38.441
I think it's about celebrating everybody.

19:38.475 --> 19:40.343
- Definitely.
- I think that's a great idea.

19:40.377 --> 19:43.746
How about this-- you,
me, the staff...Karaoke?

19:43.781 --> 19:45.915
- [laughing]
- let's do it.

19:45.949 --> 19:47.350
Yeah.

19:47.384 --> 19:48.651
[both laughing]

19:48.686 --> 19:51.721
[background chatter]

20:02.966 --> 20:05.368
Hey, man. What's going on, man?

20:05.402 --> 20:06.869
You dead or something?

20:06.904 --> 20:09.405
Doing this whole drun
k-out wino thing in the cafeteria, man,

20:09.440 --> 20:11.507
That ain't gonna get you
nowhere with the ladies, dude.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.409
No, I was just-- I was up all night.

20:13.444 --> 20:15.611
Probably gonna be up all
night every night this week.

20:15.646 --> 20:17.180
So what the hell was you doing?

20:17.214 --> 20:19.182
Got to rebuild the entire
fence at the ranch, man.

20:19.216 --> 20:22.018
Some idiot's been stealing all the cows.

20:22.052 --> 20:23.453
Man, maybe I can ask the team.

20:23.487 --> 20:26.122
Maybe some of us come
out and give you a hand.

20:26.156 --> 20:27.690
Right. You think they'd do that?

20:27.725 --> 20:29.859
Man, I'll ask. It don't hurt to ask, dude.

20:29.893 --> 20:31.728
All right, you do that,

20:31.762 --> 20:34.430
And I'll just be here sleeping, all right?

20:34.465 --> 20:37.834
Okay, cool.

20:37.868 --> 20:39.435
Mmm. Damn.

20:39.470 --> 20:42.739
These are pretty good fries. Mmm, mmm!

20:46.777 --> 20:49.946
- Can I help you?
- I'm vincent's mother...

20:49.980 --> 20:51.314
Regina.

20:51.348 --> 20:54.817
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. How are you?

20:54.852 --> 20:56.252
I'm well.

20:56.286 --> 20:59.756
I'm afraid the last time
you saw me, I was, uh...

20:59.790 --> 21:01.491
In not such good shape.

21:01.525 --> 21:03.292
Well, I'm working on it.

21:03.327 --> 21:05.161
That's good.

21:05.195 --> 21:07.296
[laughs]

21:07.331 --> 21:11.834
I just wanted to come
by and say thank you...

21:11.869 --> 21:14.704
Thank you for making my son quarterback.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.776
You know, things like that
ain't supposed to happen to us.

21:19.810 --> 21:22.979
[laughs] we don't get a lot of good breaks.

21:23.013 --> 21:25.615
You should have seen the look on his face

21:25.649 --> 21:28.684
When he told me, um...

21:28.719 --> 21:32.021
It was like he was a kid again.

21:32.055 --> 21:35.425
I haven't seen that face
in a really long time.

21:35.459 --> 21:38.961
I didn't give it to him. He earned it.

21:38.996 --> 21:43.633
I thank you... For believing in my boy.

21:43.667 --> 21:47.203
He's a good kid.

21:49.339 --> 21:52.208
* working at the car wash *

21:52.242 --> 21:54.343
[whooping]

21:54.378 --> 21:55.978
* car wash *

21:56.013 --> 21:58.548
Whoo! Ooh, yeah!

21:58.582 --> 22:00.349
* work and work *

22:00.384 --> 22:01.884
* *

22:01.919 --> 22:04.053
* at the car wash *

22:04.087 --> 22:05.455
* oh, yeah *

22:05.489 --> 22:08.391
- Whoo!
- Nice.

22:08.425 --> 22:11.260
That was great! I can't believe that.

22:11.295 --> 22:13.429
Have some shots coming
to the table, folks.

22:13.464 --> 22:15.698
Pass them around, pass them around.

22:15.732 --> 22:17.500
- Who ordered shots?
- I ordered shots.

22:17.534 --> 22:19.669
Everybody's taking a taxi home.

22:19.703 --> 22:21.103
That's it. Thank you, glenn.

22:21.138 --> 22:23.339
- Thank you!
- So I, uh...

22:23.373 --> 22:25.141
I would like to propose a toast.

22:25.175 --> 22:27.376
We've all been at dillon for a while now,

22:27.411 --> 22:29.378
And I think most of us know what it was like

22:29.413 --> 22:30.847
Before tami got here.

22:30.881 --> 22:33.082
- Yeah, it sucked.
- It did suck.

22:33.116 --> 22:34.383
[laughter]

22:34.418 --> 22:36.219
But what matters most is that we all know

22:36.253 --> 22:37.620
What it's like now that you're here.

22:37.654 --> 22:38.955
To a job well done.

22:38.989 --> 22:41.224
Always smart, always professional.

22:41.258 --> 22:43.392
That's right, you get
the job done every time,

22:43.427 --> 22:46.295
In spite of all of that,
you know, that political crap

22:46.330 --> 22:49.198
And that football stuff and just
the district and everything.

22:49.233 --> 22:50.800
- Oh, lord help us.
- No, I mean, it's--

22:50.834 --> 22:52.702
It's really meant a lot to us and to me.

22:52.736 --> 22:54.203
To you, to our fearless leader.

22:54.238 --> 22:56.606
Well, to all of y'all. To everybody.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.241
Congratulations. - Cheers!

22:58.275 --> 23:00.910
Well done. Group: Cheers.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.645

23:02.679 --> 23:04.981
* hey, hey, hey, hey *

23:20.864 --> 23:22.932
* I'll be alone *

23:22.966 --> 23:25.801
* dancin', you know it, baby *

23:25.836 --> 23:29.739

23:29.773 --> 23:32.642

23:32.676 --> 23:33.643

23:33.677 --> 23:36.479
Ah...

23:36.513 --> 23:38.881
When do you think the cabs come?

23:38.916 --> 23:43.252
I don't know. They'll be here in a minute.

23:43.287 --> 23:45.555
That was, uh--that was
pretty awesome, wasn't it?

23:45.589 --> 23:47.089
That was really fun.

23:47.124 --> 23:49.158
We should do it more often, you know?

23:49.192 --> 23:50.793
We should do it all the time.

23:50.827 --> 23:52.795
Well, I don't know if you'll
feel that way tomorrow morning

23:52.829 --> 23:54.263
When you wake up and your head is banging...

23:54.298 --> 23:55.831
Be totally worth it.

23:55.866 --> 23:57.700
I wanted you to have a good night, you know?

23:57.734 --> 24:00.536
You're so sweet. Thank you.

24:00.571 --> 24:02.271
Well, there you go. The, uh...

24:02.306 --> 24:03.940
Oh, here's a cab. Great, great, great.

24:03.974 --> 24:06.709
You go ahead. I'll, um,
wait for the next one.

24:06.743 --> 24:08.077
All right, I'm gonna take you up on it,

24:08.111 --> 24:09.145
'cause you're a gentleman.

24:09.179 --> 24:10.846
All right, thank you, that was--oh.

24:10.881 --> 24:12.949
It was such a-- such a fun thing,

24:12.983 --> 24:14.884
And it was good for everybody, I thought.

24:14.918 --> 24:16.719
You're the best, tami. You are the best.

24:16.753 --> 24:19.388
Thank you.

24:19.423 --> 24:22.124
Oh--glenn!

24:22.159 --> 24:23.693
Oh...

24:23.727 --> 24:25.461
- I
-I'm so sorry.

24:25.495 --> 24:28.097
- No, it's okay, I--
- no, it's--

24:28.131 --> 24:30.333
You get yourself he safe, okay?

24:30.367 --> 24:32.735
I'll see--I'll see you at school, all right?

24:48.719 --> 24:51.554
Why are you here?

24:51.588 --> 24:55.224
How you doing?

24:58.762 --> 25:01.197
You like being quarterback?

25:01.231 --> 25:02.398
Yeah.

25:02.432 --> 25:03.966
Quarterback's a leader.

25:04.001 --> 25:06.535
Quarterback makes decisions, makes choices.

25:06.570 --> 25:11.073
Quarterback has got to be clear
on what has got to be done.

25:11.108 --> 25:14.543
You've got to make a decision.

25:14.578 --> 25:18.014
Why do you care about what I do so much?

25:18.048 --> 25:19.548
What you getting out of this?

25:19.583 --> 25:21.450
Ain't I just another player
that can throw the ball

25:21.485 --> 25:22.918
And run fast?

25:22.953 --> 25:25.087
Coach, if I break my ankle and
can't play for you no more,

25:25.122 --> 25:26.689
You still gonna come around here?

25:26.723 --> 25:29.992
You still gonna check up on me?

25:30.027 --> 25:32.028
This is my life.

25:32.062 --> 25:34.764
I been living here ten years

25:34.798 --> 25:36.432
And seen three of my best friends get killed

25:36.466 --> 25:38.734
Walking to school.

25:38.769 --> 25:40.736
When I leave your practice,

25:40.771 --> 25:42.538
I'm the one looking over my shoulder,

25:42.572 --> 25:44.373
Hoping I don't get jumped,

25:44.408 --> 25:47.043
Robbed, killed.

25:49.546 --> 25:52.048
You get in any more trouble with the law,

25:52.082 --> 25:53.683
You're going straight to juvie.

25:53.717 --> 25:56.252
Who puts the food up there on the table?

25:56.286 --> 25:59.288
Who makes sure the bills get paid?

26:02.793 --> 26:07.463
Who's gonna take care of
that if you're locked up?

26:07.497 --> 26:10.399
I'm offering you...

26:10.434 --> 26:12.735
Everything I got.

26:12.769 --> 26:17.406
This is not just about football.

26:17.441 --> 26:20.109
Think about that.

26:26.717 --> 26:31.053
I beg of you, think about what I just said.

26:41.798 --> 26:44.467
Welcome to the 2009 academic smackdown.

26:44.501 --> 26:45.634
Testing, testing.

26:45.669 --> 26:47.136
Hi, glenn.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.171
Hey.

26:51.007 --> 26:52.174
How you doing today?

26:52.209 --> 26:54.276
Good. Good, good, good.

26:54.311 --> 26:56.946
Almost set up.

26:56.980 --> 26:58.814
How you feeling today?

27:01.384 --> 27:03.152
[sighs]

27:03.186 --> 27:04.954
I feel like the, uh...

27:04.988 --> 27:06.789
Like the biggest idiot that ever lived.

27:06.823 --> 27:08.858
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

27:08.892 --> 27:11.660
I mean, I-I-I practically
raped you, you know?

27:11.695 --> 27:13.562
No, you didn't. [laughs]

27:13.597 --> 27:15.131
Well, no, I mean, not-- not literally,

27:15.165 --> 27:17.032
But with my mouth-
it's like I mouth-raped you.

27:17.067 --> 27:18.901
- No.
- I can't believe I did that.

27:18.935 --> 27:20.469
I mean, I'm mr. Liberal, you know?

27:20.504 --> 27:23.806
I-I grab a beautiful married woman,

27:23.840 --> 27:25.341
And I-I-I kiss her

27:25.375 --> 27:27.176
Like I'm some sort of, you know,

27:27.210 --> 27:30.946
Neanderthal, unevolved caveman or something,

27:30.981 --> 27:32.748
And I am not that type of person.

27:32.783 --> 27:34.450
I'm not somebody who
does something like that.

27:34.484 --> 27:35.684
I know. Glenn, I know.

27:35.719 --> 27:37.820
I don't want you to beat
yourself up about it.

27:37.854 --> 27:40.456
Listen, you did such a nice
thing for all those people

27:40.490 --> 27:42.191
Last night, for me and for everybody,

27:42.225 --> 27:45.795
And it was such a nice
party that you planned.

27:45.829 --> 27:47.563
And--and that last part...

27:47.597 --> 27:50.299
Can't ever happen again, that's all.

28:24.534 --> 28:27.503
[mellow piano music]

28:27.537 --> 28:35.544
* *

29:00.503 --> 29:03.305
Okay, this is for east dillon high.

29:03.340 --> 29:05.808
Name the first novel and the last novel

29:05.842 --> 29:10.679
By the mid-century american
novelist thomas wolfe,

29:10.714 --> 29:13.382
Both of which deal with the american theme

29:13.416 --> 29:16.552
Of the wanderer.

29:16.586 --> 29:19.722
- I
-I know this.

29:19.756 --> 29:21.724
- You do?
- Okay.

29:21.758 --> 29:24.894
Anyone want to take this?

29:27.631 --> 29:30.966
Here we go.

29:31.001 --> 29:34.103
- [whispering] hey...
- Shh.

29:34.137 --> 29:36.972
The first and last novel

29:37.007 --> 29:39.675
By mid-century american
novelist thomas wolfe,

29:39.709 --> 29:45.447
Both which deal with the
american theme of...

29:45.482 --> 29:49.551
Wanderer...

29:49.586 --> 29:51.387
[crying] the first is

29:51.421 --> 29:54.223
<i>Look homeward, angel...</i>

29:54.257 --> 29:56.425
And the second is

29:56.459 --> 29:59.662
<i>You can't go home again.</i>

30:04.034 --> 30:05.768
That is correct.

30:05.802 --> 30:10.072
East dillon takes the lead.

30:10.106 --> 30:12.741
And now for remington high.

30:12.776 --> 30:14.810
[whispering] hey...Take a break.

30:14.844 --> 30:16.912
We got you covered.

30:16.947 --> 30:19.815
<i>-...Who wrote the books galapagos...</i>

30:19.849 --> 30:22.818
[mellow music continues]

30:22.852 --> 30:25.254
* *

30:25.288 --> 30:27.456
[sobbing]

30:27.490 --> 30:29.792
Come here, sweetie.

30:29.826 --> 30:31.627
Come here.

30:31.661 --> 30:34.630
[sobbing]

30:36.366 --> 30:40.035
He called his grandmother...

30:40.070 --> 30:42.738
And his mom.

30:45.241 --> 30:47.509
I thought he was the one.

30:47.544 --> 30:50.112
I know.

30:50.146 --> 30:53.515
He can't even call after three years?

30:53.550 --> 30:56.819
I don't know what to do.

30:56.853 --> 30:59.388
I'm so tired of feeling like this.

30:59.422 --> 31:00.789
I know.

31:00.824 --> 31:03.292
And you're gonna survive,

31:03.326 --> 31:06.795
And good things are gonna
start to happen again.

31:06.830 --> 31:08.764
And one day, you may even look back,

31:08.798 --> 31:12.901
And even this will not be such a bad thing.

31:26.282 --> 31:28.350
Who the hell's that?

31:28.385 --> 31:30.819
Hey! I thought you were
bringing the whole team.

31:30.854 --> 31:32.988
They all had some party to go to.

31:33.023 --> 31:34.423
- [laughing]
- who is he?

31:34.457 --> 31:35.724
That's tinker. He's on my team.

31:35.759 --> 31:37.526
He came to help out.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.895
Hey, thanks for coming, tink.

31:39.929 --> 31:43.032
Hello, tyra.

31:43.066 --> 31:46.135
This is landry clarke calling.

31:46.169 --> 31:50.839
I am here at the designated rest stop

31:50.874 --> 31:54.076
That we agreed upon.

31:54.110 --> 31:57.212
It's kind of obvious that you are, uh...

31:57.247 --> 31:59.515
Not gonna show up, which is fine.

31:59.549 --> 32:03.018
I just kind of wanted to,
you know, see you face-to-face

32:03.053 --> 32:05.721
And kind of find out what the deal is,

32:05.755 --> 32:07.790
If I'm supposed to be waiting on you or not.

32:07.824 --> 32:09.458
Because if I'm supposed to
be waiting on you, tyra,

32:09.492 --> 32:10.993
I will wait.

32:11.027 --> 32:12.394
I will...

32:12.429 --> 32:14.863
Wait like one of those

32:14.898 --> 32:17.466
British foot guards outside
of buckingham palace.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.035
I will keep my eyes straight ahead.

32:20.070 --> 32:22.304
I won't look to the left or to the right.

32:22.338 --> 32:24.473
Uh...

32:24.507 --> 32:27.976
[sighs]

32:28.011 --> 32:32.114
I kind of have a feeling
that you're probably...

32:32.148 --> 32:35.217
Looking to the left or the right

32:35.251 --> 32:38.353
Or both...

32:38.388 --> 32:41.457
Which is fine.

32:41.491 --> 32:44.927
I guess I kind of...

32:44.961 --> 32:48.630
Just answered my own question.

32:48.665 --> 32:52.067
I guess I will...

32:52.102 --> 32:55.037
See you around, then.

33:00.710 --> 33:04.613
[overlapping shouting, loud dance music]

33:04.647 --> 33:06.115
[cheering]

33:06.149 --> 33:12.888
* *

33:12.922 --> 33:15.491
Everybody, thank you
very much for coming out.

33:15.525 --> 33:17.793
Remember that every raffle
ticket that you buy,

33:17.827 --> 33:19.995
Every dollar that you
stick between the thighs

33:20.029 --> 33:22.798
Of one of these luscious,
luscious, beautiful women

33:22.832 --> 33:24.833
Goes to help me, goes to help you,

33:24.868 --> 33:27.836
Goes to help my family and
my future kid, all right?

33:27.871 --> 33:30.172
Thank you for coming out.

33:30.206 --> 33:32.207
I can't--I can't open it.
You got to help me.

33:32.242 --> 33:35.744
Everybody rip it! [all whooping, applauding]

33:35.778 --> 33:37.346
[giggling]

33:37.380 --> 33:39.081
Oh, my god.

33:39.115 --> 33:40.582
All: Aw!

33:40.617 --> 33:48.023
* *

33:48.057 --> 33:49.525
Come here. Let me holler at you.

33:49.559 --> 33:50.993
- Uh
-huh.

33:51.027 --> 33:53.095
It's a nice place you got right here.

33:53.129 --> 33:55.063
Well, thank you.

33:55.098 --> 33:57.099
Ready to make some real money?

33:57.133 --> 34:00.435
Yeah, I... I need to make some money.

34:00.470 --> 34:02.037
I got a business opportunity

34:02.071 --> 34:04.339
That can really make you
a rich man, all right?

34:04.374 --> 34:06.542
What kind of business opportunity

34:06.576 --> 34:07.843
You talking about?

34:07.877 --> 34:10.045
I can't talk about that right now, man.

34:10.079 --> 34:12.414
- Okay.
- But, uh...

34:12.447 --> 34:14.382
Let me holler at my man.
I'll get back to you.

34:14.417 --> 34:15.918
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:15.952 --> 34:18.020
Hey, congratulations on the kid, man.

34:18.054 --> 34:19.154
Thanks.

34:19.188 --> 34:22.024
Yeah.

34:22.058 --> 34:26.360
[overlapping chatter, music]

34:26.396 --> 34:28.764
That is pretty good. Can I see 100?

34:28.797 --> 34:30.933
Hey, tim riggins.

34:30.967 --> 34:33.001
What are you doing here?

34:33.036 --> 34:34.670
Surprised to see me?

34:34.704 --> 34:36.538
Yes, I am surprised to see you.

34:36.572 --> 34:38.440
What are you doing here? - Mom's at work.

34:38.474 --> 34:40.509
Dad's at a bar.

34:40.543 --> 34:42.511
Mom gave the dog back.

34:42.545 --> 34:44.112
Right.

34:44.147 --> 34:47.449
You know, she always has
to have everything her way.

34:47.483 --> 34:50.619
Can't wait till my dad comes back.

34:50.652 --> 34:52.387
* *

34:52.422 --> 34:55.157
Come on, let's dance.

35:00.063 --> 35:01.763
Becks, come here for a second.

35:01.798 --> 35:05.067
Come here, listen to me for one second.

35:05.101 --> 35:08.270
Your dad's not coming back.

35:08.304 --> 35:10.339
How would you know what
my dad is or isn't doing?

35:10.373 --> 35:11.940
I know he's not coming back,

35:11.975 --> 35:13.642
Because I heard him on the phone.

35:13.676 --> 35:15.944
He's got a kid. He lives in seattle.

35:15.979 --> 35:18.146
He's got a whole family there.

35:18.181 --> 35:20.816
That's why he bought you a dog.

35:20.850 --> 35:22.451
Listen to me.

35:22.485 --> 35:23.752
This is what they do--

35:23.786 --> 35:26.255
Your dad, my dad.

35:26.289 --> 35:27.856
They leave, and they don't come back.

35:27.890 --> 35:31.426
They--they buy you these things
so it's not uncomfortable

35:31.461 --> 35:33.762
For the five minutes a
year they're in your face.

35:33.796 --> 35:36.298
You start to blame yourself,
the people around you,

35:36.332 --> 35:37.766
Because they've tried, and you pushed--

35:37.800 --> 35:38.967
No, listen...

35:39.002 --> 35:41.336
[sobs] could you not do it here, please?

35:41.371 --> 35:42.771
I want you to know it's not...

35:42.805 --> 35:44.172
Can we just talk about this at home?

35:44.207 --> 35:47.376
Can we just talk about this at home?

35:54.651 --> 35:57.519
Tink, where'd you learn
how to build like this?

35:57.553 --> 35:59.454
My granddad worked in construction.

35:59.489 --> 36:03.325
Well, you know what you're doing.

36:03.359 --> 36:05.694
Yes, sir.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.729
Hey. Thank you.

36:07.764 --> 36:11.133
No big deal. Luke's a good guy.

36:11.167 --> 36:12.801
He's one of those players

36:12.835 --> 36:14.303
That's holding this team together.

36:14.337 --> 36:17.205
He's pretty much a star.
Never acts like it, though.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.675
You know, I figure you know that.

36:19.709 --> 36:21.343
Anyways, I figure if I'm helping out luke,

36:21.377 --> 36:24.212
I'm helping out the team.

36:24.247 --> 36:27.749
Yeah. You're a good man.

36:33.256 --> 36:34.756
[pounding at door]

36:34.791 --> 36:35.957
I told you not to tell her!

36:35.992 --> 36:38.193
- What?
- I said I was gonna tell her.

36:38.227 --> 36:40.462
I told you not to tell her.
What the hell did you do?

36:40.496 --> 36:42.164
Look, you and I both know
you weren't gonna say a thing.

36:42.198 --> 36:43.765
You think you're hot stuff,
don't you, kid, huh?

36:43.800 --> 36:46.601
I find out you touched my daughter,
I'm gonna kick your--

36:46.636 --> 36:49.137
Funny thing is, you don't
give a damn about your daughter.

36:49.172 --> 36:53.442
You know what else is funny?
I had sex with your wife.

36:53.476 --> 36:56.078
[grunting]

37:23.873 --> 37:25.340
Hi.

37:25.375 --> 37:27.409
I know it's late. I'm sorry.

37:27.443 --> 37:28.677
But is coach home?

37:28.711 --> 37:30.746
Yeah. One sec.

37:30.780 --> 37:31.780
Hon?

37:34.384 --> 37:35.484
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:35.518 --> 37:37.185
What you doing here? You all right?

37:37.220 --> 37:39.855
Yeah. I'm getting there.

37:43.826 --> 37:45.560
There you go.

37:47.730 --> 37:48.997
All right.

37:49.031 --> 37:51.533
Sorry for coming by so late.
It's all right.

38:21.631 --> 38:24.666
[whispering] that kid trusts me.

38:27.837 --> 38:29.671
What do we do with it?

38:31.808 --> 38:34.776
It's gonna disappear.

38:38.181 --> 38:41.249
It's been a strange week.

39:07.944 --> 39:10.145
[sobbing]

39:13.483 --> 39:15.750
Hey. How you doing?

39:16.585 --> 39:20.388
Um, I'm here to get a dog about way big.

39:20.422 --> 39:23.124
A disgruntled redhead
dropped him off yesterday.

39:23.158 --> 39:26.060
And you're not gonna
bring him back tomorrow?

39:26.094 --> 39:27.328
No.

39:27.362 --> 39:29.630
Because people aren't
always very responsible

39:29.665 --> 39:31.098
About these dogs.

39:31.133 --> 39:34.902
Are you gonna be a responsible person?

39:34.936 --> 39:37.305
Yes, ma'am.

39:37.339 --> 39:38.506
[mooing]

39:38.540 --> 39:40.574
After this pen, you want to call it a day?

39:40.609 --> 39:41.876
If we don't finish up now,

39:41.910 --> 39:44.445
We're just gonna have
to do it again tomorrow.

39:44.479 --> 39:46.047
All right, then. Round them up.

39:46.081 --> 39:48.282
Nobody says that anymore.

39:48.317 --> 39:51.519
Just did. [cattle mooing]

39:51.553 --> 39:53.020
[whistles] ho!

39:53.055 --> 39:54.455
Get up, get up!

39:54.489 --> 39:57.758
Ahc

39:57.793 --> 40:00.461
Ah! Dad!

40:00.495 --> 40:02.196
Ah!

40:02.230 --> 40:05.299
Get out of there, luke. Get out!

40:05.334 --> 40:07.134
You all right?

40:07.169 --> 40:09.937
- Where'd he get you?
- Uhh...Ah...

40:09.971 --> 40:11.706
- Son, you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

40:11.740 --> 40:13.808
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

40:13.842 --> 40:15.509
Ah!

40:20.582 --> 40:24.118
Hey, jess.

40:26.555 --> 40:28.189
I actually-- I was looking for you,

40:28.223 --> 40:29.790
'cause I wanted to ask you something.

40:29.825 --> 40:31.625
Plus, I was hungry,

40:31.660 --> 40:34.362
And you make an unbelievable
pulled-pork sandwich,

40:34.396 --> 40:37.331
So...

40:37.366 --> 40:39.433
Will you go out with me?

40:39.468 --> 40:43.671
Things between me and tyra are 100% over.

40:43.705 --> 40:46.273
My life is no longer complicated,

40:46.308 --> 40:48.442
And I really would like to go out with you.

40:48.477 --> 40:52.380
I'm really happy for you. Congratulations.

40:52.414 --> 40:54.682
Just--just one date.

40:54.716 --> 40:56.884
[laughs] why would I do that?

40:56.918 --> 41:00.154
I don't--I'm-- I have a car.

41:00.188 --> 41:01.155
Play guitar.

41:01.189 --> 41:03.057
I might write you a song someday.

41:03.091 --> 41:05.126
Then you'd be the girl in the so-
-I don't know.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.361
Would you please go on a date with me?

41:07.396 --> 41:09.864
So, yes?

41:09.898 --> 41:11.399
[dog whining]

41:11.433 --> 41:13.367
All right, you tell me
what your name's gonna be,

41:13.402 --> 41:14.869
All right?

41:14.903 --> 41:16.704
'cause julien it's not. Yeah, I know.

41:16.738 --> 41:18.205
It is boring, isn't it?

41:18.240 --> 41:20.708
How about skeeter?

41:20.742 --> 41:22.376
Oh, look at that.

41:22.411 --> 41:25.679
Yeah, skeeter it is. Yes.

41:25.714 --> 41:29.350
It's skeeter. Your new name is skeet man.

41:29.384 --> 41:30.818
You're the skeeter. [skeeter whining]

41:30.852 --> 41:33.354
You're still whining, and I don't know why.

41:33.388 --> 41:35.556
Whatever you do, don't go in here, okay?

41:35.590 --> 41:38.826
That's lesson-- lesson number one.

41:38.860 --> 41:40.327
- [whining]
- here. Here, no.

41:40.362 --> 41:43.497
Here, don't go in here.
We're gonna pull in right now.

41:43.532 --> 41:44.732
Here we go.

41:44.766 --> 41:48.602
Just please don't go in my truck.

41:48.637 --> 41:50.471
- [whining]
- I'm gonna let you go.

41:50.505 --> 41:53.908
[barking]

41:53.942 --> 41:55.643
Okay. Do your thing.

41:55.677 --> 41:58.345
Do your thing, skeeter.

42:12.227 --> 42:15.596
It's pretty great.
