00:31.240 --> 00:32.120
Hello.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.720
Hello! How you doing?

00:36.880 --> 00:37.720
Great.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.800
Thank you.

00:38.880 --> 00:39.800
Wow.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.120
Calm down.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.040
Shut the fuck up.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.040
Thank you. What a lovely welcome.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.040
I'm gonna try my hardest tonight.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.840
You're thinking, "Relax, we've had 
our money's worth just seeing you."

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
What? You're a legend. Shut up! 
What is he?

00:59.040 --> 01:00.200
I'm not a god.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.080
I'm just an ordinary guy, you know,

01:04.160 --> 01:05.920
going round talking to people

01:06.000 --> 01:08.120
sort... sort of like Jesus...

01:09.840 --> 01:11.800
in a way... but better.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.240
Well, I've actually turned up. So...

01:21.360 --> 01:24.000
Thank you and welcome 
to my new show, Humanity.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.160
I don't know why I called it that.
I'm not a big fan.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.520
I prefer dogs... obviously.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.560
Dogs are better people than people, 
aren't they?

01:32.640 --> 01:34.320
They're amazing, dogs.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.000
They're our best friends.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.880
They guard us, they guide us.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.960
There's medical detection dogs

01:40.040 --> 01:41.840
that can smell if you've got...

01:42.440 --> 01:43.280
AIDS.

01:44.480 --> 01:48.200
I'm not a doctor...
but their noses are a thousand times

01:48.280 --> 01:50.120
more sensitive than ours, so they go,

01:50.200 --> 01:52.880
"Cor, you're well HIV! Fuck!" You know?

01:54.240 --> 01:56.880
And you go, 
"You can smell AIDS on someone?"

01:57.600 --> 01:58.480
Yeah.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.280
"Why didn't you smell it on the bloke

02:01.360 --> 02:03.560
I brought home last night, 
you fucking idiot?"

02:06.800 --> 02:10.040
They did the first three billion years 
by themselves,

02:10.160 --> 02:11.520
evolution and all that.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.560
Then we got involved
and did some selective breeding.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.200
Getting them how we wanted, 
to do jobs for us.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.640
Bit stronger, faster, whatever.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.560
They're great at the jobs
they're bred to do.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.640
They love the job they're bred to do.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.320
They're genetically hardwired 
to love that behavior.

02:27.800 --> 02:32.040
Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback
was bred to hunt lions.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.440
I can't help but think it was 
a shock to it when it found out.

02:37.560 --> 02:40.480
So we've got all the pedigrees
for miles around.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.120
A big passing-out parade.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.160
There's a bloke with a white coat
and a clipboard.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.400
He goes, "Right, dogs!"
They go, "What?"

02:47.480 --> 02:49.320
"Who wants to know what job they got?"

02:49.400 --> 02:50.720
"We all do. We all do."

02:51.480 --> 02:52.920
"Okay, Labradors."

02:53.000 --> 02:53.920
"Yeah?"

02:56.680 --> 02:59.680
"Do you like carefully bringing back 
dead ducks?"

03:00.480 --> 03:01.360
"Yeah?"

03:02.920 --> 03:04.080
"That's your job."

03:04.160 --> 03:05.560
"Amazing. That is amazing.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.200
That is my favorite job. 
That is my favorite job."

03:09.200 --> 03:10.160
"Jack Russells?"

03:10.240 --> 03:12.880
-"Yeah?"
-"You like shooting down rabbit holes?"

03:12.960 --> 03:14.760
-"Yeah!"
-"That's your job."

03:14.840 --> 03:17.640
"Fuckin' hell. 
Best day ever! Best day ever!"

03:19.560 --> 03:21.320
-"Miniature poodles?"
-"Yeah?"

03:21.400 --> 03:24.600
"Do you like being carried around
by elderly homosexuals?"

03:26.560 --> 03:28.040
-"Yeah."
-"That's your job."

03:28.200 --> 03:29.160
That's your job.

03:34.000 --> 03:34.880
"Ridgebacks?"

03:34.960 --> 03:35.880
"Yo!"

03:37.120 --> 03:38.280
"You're hunting lions."

03:38.480 --> 03:39.320
"What?"

03:41.640 --> 03:42.840
"You're hunting lions."

03:45.080 --> 03:46.120
"Fuck off!"

03:47.760 --> 03:49.720
-"Yeah, you are."
-"No, we're not.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.800
Look, lions?

03:50.880 --> 03:52.680
We'll get fucking mashed!

03:52.760 --> 03:55.320
Why can't the Rottweilers hunt lions?"

03:55.920 --> 03:57.440
"They're shaking babies."

04:00.000 --> 04:01.080
Good boy!

04:01.800 --> 04:04.040
Good boy! You shake that baby if you want.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.160
Good boy!

04:07.320 --> 04:08.160
Cheers.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.880
This is my first new stand-up 
for seven years,

04:14.960 --> 04:16.640
if you don't count the Golden Globes.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.600
Which you shouldn't.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.280
The Golden Globes. Very different.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.040
God, a different vibe.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.040
Two hundred million people watching.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.160
And it's live.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.400
Big thrill.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.240
But with that many people watching,

04:30.320 --> 04:31.600
there's a bit of stick.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.960
Everyone's different, 
everyone's a blogger.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.840
Everyone goes, "I was offended."

04:37.640 --> 04:39.800
-"Why?"
-"He said an horrible thing."

04:39.880 --> 04:41.600
"He said loads of horrible things."

04:41.680 --> 04:44.520
"Yeah, but that was a thing 
that I care about."

04:45.480 --> 04:46.920
That's the thing about offense,

04:47.000 --> 04:48.480
it's about personal feelings.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.480
I don't care about the backlash.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.160
"Comedian in hot water."

04:53.560 --> 04:54.480
You know?

04:54.560 --> 04:57.600
My girlfriend, Jane, she worries,
and she reads things.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.080
"What have you said?"

05:00.160 --> 05:01.000
"Don't worry.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.040
They won't come to the house. Fuck 'em."

05:06.000 --> 05:07.520
So I wind her up.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.920
I pretend I'm gonna say much worse things

05:10.000 --> 05:11.120
than I ever would.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.240
I have to make up worse jokes

05:13.320 --> 05:14.760
than I actually...

05:16.080 --> 05:18.080
Just to scare my girlfriend.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.120
When I do the Golden Globes,
we go out about a week before.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.840
It's in LA. We fly out.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.720
I'm writing jokes 
as the ceremony approaches.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.520
They release more presenters.
I take my pick.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.880
"I got a good intro for them. Yeah.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.240
Mel Gibson? I'll introduce him, yes."

05:37.520 --> 05:39.760
About three days before this last one,

05:40.200 --> 05:42.720
just to wind Jane up, I said, 
"I got a good intro."

05:42.800 --> 05:43.840
She went, "What?"

05:43.920 --> 05:47.560
I said, "Bill Cosby would make
our next presenter sleep on the couch.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.520
Please welcome Helen Mirren!"

05:52.320 --> 05:53.480
I didn't do it.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.840
She said, "You won't do that?"
I said, "No."

05:58.240 --> 05:59.440
Next day, I got her again.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.400
I said, "Is this too much?"

06:01.480 --> 06:04.840
I said, "Not even Bill Cosby
carries enough tranquilizer

06:04.920 --> 06:07.200
to bring down
this next magnificent beast.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.000
Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!"

06:12.320 --> 06:14.600
I didn't do it! I would never...

06:15.480 --> 06:18.600
I'd never... tell a joke like that. 
It's horrible.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.680
I was just doing it to annoy Jane.

06:20.760 --> 06:21.920
I'd never even...

06:22.840 --> 06:24.640
think... of that,

06:24.720 --> 06:25.600
so don't...

06:27.000 --> 06:30.680
Even on the day, on the way
to the red carpet, in the limo,

06:30.760 --> 06:33.560
I said, "I'll start with 
a funny one-liner.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.920
An old-fashioned joke."

06:35.000 --> 06:36.600
She went, "What?" I said,

06:36.680 --> 06:40.120
"What did the deaf, dumb and blind
orphan get for Christmas?"

06:40.200 --> 06:41.680
Jane went, "I don't know."

06:41.760 --> 06:42.960
I said, "Cancer."

06:48.240 --> 06:50.760
I didn't do it, so...

06:50.840 --> 06:52.960
you're getting offended at a joke

06:53.040 --> 06:54.800
that doesn't exist, so...

06:55.280 --> 06:58.320
I'd never say that in public, so...

06:59.200 --> 07:01.320
To anyone who mattered, anyway.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.240
So, don't...

07:04.480 --> 07:07.720
I didn't have to worry about 
offending anyone. It just happens.

07:10.160 --> 07:14.000
The big controversy last time I did it
was a Caitlyn Jenner joke.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.360
Outrage on Twitter the next day.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.600
I mean a couple of people going,

07:18.680 --> 07:20.160
"It was transphobic."

07:21.040 --> 07:22.840
It wasn't transphobic in the slightest.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.920
It was a joke about a trans person,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.120
but it had nothing to do
with that aspect of her existence.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.920
And that's the other thing 
about offense.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.600
People mistake the subject of a joke
with the actual target.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.160
They're not necessarily the same.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.520
I'll tell you the joke,
you make your minds up.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.960
It's live, so they go,

07:45.040 --> 07:48.400
"Your host for the 68th Annual
Golden Globes Awards,

07:48.480 --> 07:50.080
please welcome Ricky Gervais."

07:50.160 --> 07:52.960
They're all clapping, 
the actors are smiling at me.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.080
Nervously. It's brilliant, right?

07:56.720 --> 07:57.920
So, I just go,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.600
"Relax, I'm gonna be nice tonight.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.080
I've changed.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.840
Not as much as Bruce Jenner,
obviously."

08:11.160 --> 08:15.560
And I go, "Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course."
And what a year she's had.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.240
Became a role model 
for trans people everywhere,

08:18.320 --> 08:21.840
bravely breaking down barriers
and destroying stereotypes.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.560
She didn't do a lot for women drivers..."

08:28.160 --> 08:30.400
That's a clever joke. I'll tell you why.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.360
Right?

08:32.640 --> 08:35.160
It's layered. No, listen, right?

08:35.240 --> 08:38.360
The subject of that joke is stereotypes.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.120
I'm playing with the notion
of stereotypes.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.320
I start by saying she's a real woman,

08:43.400 --> 08:45.360
a liberal, progressive attitude.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.240
Then if she's a real woman,

08:47.320 --> 08:49.600
I hit them with 
the old-fashioned stereotype.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.120
She must be a bad driver, then. Right?

08:52.200 --> 08:56.240
The target of the joke is a celebrity
killing someone in their car.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.120
Let's not forget that, shall we?

09:00.680 --> 09:05.000
A celebrity killing someone in their car,
running home and popping on a dress.

09:05.080 --> 09:05.920
That's...

09:06.640 --> 09:09.760
the target of the joke,
just so we're clear.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.680
Okay?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.800
She was interviewed a week later

09:14.880 --> 09:17.280
at a press conference for a show of hers.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.520
Now cancelled.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.640
And...

09:21.120 --> 09:24.640
one of the press said, "What do you
think of the Ricky Gervais joke?"

09:24.720 --> 09:27.680
She went, "Maybe I should host
the Golden Globes."

09:27.760 --> 09:30.680
And they tweeted that and @-ed me in,

09:30.760 --> 09:32.880
because they want a celebrity feud.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.960
It was clickbait. I rose to the bait.

09:36.040 --> 09:36.880
Obviously...

09:40.400 --> 09:41.320
I just sent back,

09:41.400 --> 09:43.880
"Let her host. Just don't let her drive."

09:50.840 --> 09:54.320
Another website that was in the room,
Entertainment Weekly,

09:54.400 --> 09:57.920
they tweeted a different headline, 
and they @-ed me in.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.160
Their headline was "Caitlyn finally 
breaks silence over Ricky Gervais."

10:02.240 --> 10:05.600
I just sent back:
"At last. She always brakes too late."

10:08.760 --> 10:09.600
Bring it on.

10:09.880 --> 10:10.720
Bring it on.

10:14.760 --> 10:17.920
But I'm a considered comedian.
I like my jokes to be accurate

10:18.000 --> 10:19.600
and my targets to be fair.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.880
So I was engaging these people, saying,

10:22.400 --> 10:25.440
"Why is it transphobic?"
They said, "It's about a trans person."

10:25.520 --> 10:26.520
That's ridiculous.

10:26.600 --> 10:30.000
That's like saying a joke about Bill Cosby
is automatically racist.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.360
It depends on the joke.
But I'm willing to learn.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.920
I found out my crime was
that I dead-named her.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.160
I'd never heard that term

10:38.240 --> 10:40.360
before a day after the Golden Globes.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.000
And that was saying her old name,

10:43.080 --> 10:45.640
and even acknowledging she used 
to be a man.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.360
But she did!

10:53.720 --> 10:56.320
I saw him on the Olympic Games!

10:57.840 --> 11:00.040
He was a decathlete, he was in everything!

11:00.120 --> 11:03.440
All over the place!
Shot put and pole vault.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.160
He won a medal! He was famous!

11:06.240 --> 11:08.760
He was on telly all the time, you know?

11:08.840 --> 11:11.880
A big... famous... man.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.360
With a huge... I don't know. I'm guessing.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.760
Probably. He was big.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.520
But I've learnt my lesson.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.920
Now I know it's wrong.
I'd never dead-name her now.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.760
But, years ago,

11:22.840 --> 11:25.840
when she was a... man...

11:26.920 --> 11:28.400
Years ago, I'm saying.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.040
And she went to the... doctor...

11:30.120 --> 11:32.520
and... knocked on the door.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.280
The doctor went, "Come in!"

11:34.360 --> 11:35.560
This is years ago.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.480
I'd never dead-name her now,
but this is like...

11:38.560 --> 11:41.720
a flashback before anyone... 
You know what... so...

11:41.800 --> 11:43.240
so, like, "Come in!"

11:43.320 --> 11:47.000
And he went, "Hello, Bruce Jenner."
Because that...

11:47.080 --> 11:49.080
that was his name... then.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.120
The doctor-- This was years ago...

11:51.240 --> 11:54.920
The doctor went, "All right, Bruce Jenner,
how you doing, you fucker?

11:56.280 --> 11:57.360
You big old lunk.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.360
How you doing?

11:59.280 --> 12:00.960
Come here, you, you fucker.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.320
How you doing, Brucie boy?"

12:05.880 --> 12:09.000
And Bruce Jenner-- That was his name. 
This is years ago.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.360
Right? So...

12:11.280 --> 12:14.040
Bruce Jenner went, "Yeah.
Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah."

12:16.280 --> 12:19.960
"What can I do for you, Bruce, 
you fucker? How you doing, boy?"

12:20.040 --> 12:21.200
And Bruce Jenner went--

12:21.280 --> 12:23.480
That was his name.
Bruce Jenner went...

12:24.320 --> 12:25.360
"Look at that."

12:26.400 --> 12:29.160
The doctor went, "Come on,
Bruce Jenner, you know the rules."

12:29.240 --> 12:32.480
He uses his whole name every time,
for some reason...

12:33.840 --> 12:37.280
"Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. 
You know the rules.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.520
You can't bring your big old
pole vaulting pole in here, mate."

12:41.520 --> 12:43.520
Bruce Jenner went, "No, that's 
not my pole,

12:43.600 --> 12:45.120
that's my enormous penis."

12:45.920 --> 12:49.200
"Well, seeing as it's your penis,
you can bring it in here.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.840
But you should have left your shot puts
outside."

12:53.600 --> 12:55.440
And Bruce Jenner went...

12:55.520 --> 12:57.120
That was his name for...

12:57.960 --> 12:59.800
fifty-eight years, I think.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.200
He went, "No, they're not my shot puts,
Doctor,

13:08.280 --> 13:09.920
they're my enormous testicles."

13:10.000 --> 13:15.480
That's where I keep my testosterone, 
and my spunk, and shit, right?

13:15.560 --> 13:17.960
And the doctor went, "Oh yeah.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.200
That makes perfect--

13:19.280 --> 13:21.760
I'm a medical man. You're a big bloke.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.280
You fucker. How you doing, boy?
You're a big...

13:24.920 --> 13:27.440
You're big, 
and you would have a big old...

13:27.520 --> 13:29.600
cock and... balls.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.800
They're beautiful."

13:30.880 --> 13:32.320
Bit familiar, innit?

13:32.400 --> 13:35.120
"No, you must be very proud of them,
Bruce."

13:35.800 --> 13:38.480
Bruce went, 
"This is going to surprise you, Doctor.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.560
I wanna get rid of them."

13:40.640 --> 13:42.960
And the doctor went, "What? Why?"

13:43.040 --> 13:46.000
"Oh, they get in the way."
"In the way of what?"

13:46.080 --> 13:48.080
"Fucking driving, for one thing!"

13:55.640 --> 13:58.320
So, I'm engaging these people, 
and I'm saying,

13:58.400 --> 14:00.000
"But I had to say her old name.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.320
That's the joke. I say, "I've changed.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.800
Not as much as Bruce Jenner."

14:03.880 --> 14:05.760
Then I do the joke." But, no.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.600
This is my second crime.
I say, she hasn't changed.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.360
She's always identified as a woman.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.840
That means she's a woman.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.280
Fine, if that's the rules.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.360
If you feel you're a woman, you are.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.520
I'm not a bigot who thinks

14:18.600 --> 14:20.960
having all that done 
is science going too far.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.200
In fact, 
I don't think it's going far enough.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.880
Cause I've always identified as a chimp,
right?

14:27.960 --> 14:29.040
Well, I am a chimp.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.920
If I say I'm a chimp, I am a chimp.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.320
Pre-op.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.560
But...

14:34.960 --> 14:36.320
Don't ever dead-name me.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.320
Don't call me Ricky Gervais again.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.120
From now on, you call me Bobo.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.760
I'm gonna have species realignment.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.400
I'm halfway there.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.040
I'm short, with short legs and long arms.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.920
I stoop. 
My back's getting hairier by the day.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.760
I've got fangs, like that.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.000
I love nuts. I love nuts.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.000
Once, I was at the zoo, 
and people were looking at me,

14:58.080 --> 15:00.040
so I just started masturbating, like...

15:01.840 --> 15:02.840
So...

15:03.720 --> 15:05.440
I am a chimp, right?

15:06.600 --> 15:08.640
I am a chimp if I say I'm a chimp.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.400
I've got to live as a chimp for a year.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.360
Then have hormones, 
get me all nice and hairy.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.720
That'd be lovely.

15:14.800 --> 15:18.400
I'm gonna stay a male chimp...
so I can keep all that, right?

15:18.480 --> 15:19.920
Male, heterosexual chimp.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.680
Keep the same girlfriend.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.040
Jane would be happy. She loves me,

15:24.120 --> 15:26.520
she loves chimps, so... You know.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.720
I reckon that's got to be easier

15:29.800 --> 15:31.920
for a man to turn into a chimp,

15:32.000 --> 15:33.600
we're so close, than for a man

15:33.680 --> 15:35.760
to turn into a woman, in many ways.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.280
A bit of hair, and a top lip like that,

15:38.360 --> 15:41.200
as opposed to your cock and balls
ripped off...

15:41.280 --> 15:43.600
and a hole gouged out, into--

15:43.680 --> 15:44.800
I'm not a doctor!

15:44.880 --> 15:46.120
But that is...

15:47.600 --> 15:48.760
the gist of it.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.000
I know which one I'd rather have done.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.200
I'm not saying chimps are better
than women. No way.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.880
Right? Any ladies here?

15:57.960 --> 15:59.520
I can't see you, but, to me,

15:59.600 --> 16:02.120
every single one of you is equal...

16:02.200 --> 16:03.800
to a chimp. So...

16:07.160 --> 16:09.600
So, I'd have all that done, hair and that.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.320
I'd do all that, all the...

16:13.360 --> 16:16.000
I'll retain the ability to speak English.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.440
Like in emergencies. I'm talking to Jane,
she's going, "What is it?"

16:21.320 --> 16:22.600
"What is it, Bobo?"

16:22.680 --> 16:24.920
"You left the fucking oven on!
There's a fire!"

16:28.240 --> 16:32.000
Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner
was being chased by a wolf,

16:32.080 --> 16:34.720
and there was a big fence
but she had a long pole,

16:35.120 --> 16:37.240
she'd... revert.

16:37.320 --> 16:38.800
She'd be over that fucking...

16:39.480 --> 16:40.640
Easy.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.880
So I'd have all that done. Top lip.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.320
Doing all that. Right?

16:48.400 --> 16:49.920
I'll be legally a chimp.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.400
I'll be well... properly chimped-up.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.080
I'll be able to use chimp toilets!

16:54.920 --> 16:58.560
I'll be walking along,  
holding Jane's hand. "Come on, Bobo."

17:00.640 --> 17:03.000
Right? We don't hold hands now.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.600
I don't know why she's all over me 
now I'm a chimp.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.360
But we'll be all in love. 
Maybe matching jumpers.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.000
"Come on, Bobo." In love. Just two...
Like that.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.120
Then, if a bigot in a van slows down
and goes,

17:17.200 --> 17:18.640
"That's fucking disgusting."

17:19.040 --> 17:21.200
I'll fling shit at him and run up a tree.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.720
And that's why that joke
isn't transphobic. So...

17:27.800 --> 17:28.760
Cheers.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.640
So, humanity.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.240
What is humanity?

17:37.320 --> 17:38.520
What are we?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.640
Well, we've touched upon it there.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.040
We're great apes.

17:42.120 --> 17:45.280
Not metaphorically!
We're literally great apes.

17:45.360 --> 17:49.280
We are 98.6% genetically identical
to a chimpanzee.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.920
We're closer to chimps 
than chimps are to gorillas.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.720
We left our common ancestor 
about six million years ago.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.960
We have the same life cycle.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.360
Same as any other animal. Which is...

17:59.440 --> 18:01.280
our parents mate...

18:01.360 --> 18:02.640
we're born...

18:02.720 --> 18:03.840
we grow...

18:03.920 --> 18:05.160
we mate...

18:05.240 --> 18:06.440
our parents die...

18:07.040 --> 18:08.600
our friends die...

18:09.560 --> 18:10.880
and then we die.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.280
Now...

18:14.360 --> 18:17.200
my seven-year-old niece
didn't like hearing that.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.200
But I said, "You've gotta learn.
Stop crying."

18:21.280 --> 18:23.520
I said, "You're seven.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.280
You know... today.

18:25.920 --> 18:26.760
So...

18:32.800 --> 18:36.040
Any more grizzling
and this party's cancelled, so..."

18:37.200 --> 18:39.800
Let's take the first of those. Birth.

18:39.920 --> 18:43.120
It's odd, because a human is born
before the end

18:43.200 --> 18:44.680
of its natural gestation period.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.040
I mean, because of our evolution,

18:47.120 --> 18:48.560
our brain is so big,

18:48.640 --> 18:50.840
we have to get that huge head out early.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.680
That's why the skull 
is in parts and supple.

18:53.760 --> 18:57.880
Then we go on gestating outside the womb.
That's why we're so useless.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.240
Look at other mammals.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.080
A giraffe is walking along.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.960
It goes, "I'm proper pregnant."
Right?

19:05.240 --> 19:07.440
I'm gonna have a baby giraffe right here.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.040
Yeah, there it is.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.320
See you later.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.800
And the baby goes,

19:15.880 --> 19:18.200
"Mum!" It's got to be fucking ready.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.280
We're... we're helpless, right?

19:20.360 --> 19:24.360
Just think, nine months we're growing
in this perfect environment.

19:25.800 --> 19:26.680
Everything's...

19:29.320 --> 19:31.960
It's like being
in a little Kate Bush video, right?

19:33.040 --> 19:36.920
Then, suddenly, you're being squeezed
out of an hole near an ass.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.200
You're covered in shit, there's screaming.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.240
You go, "I can't breathe." Someone goes,
"Yes, you fucking can!"

19:44.920 --> 19:47.000
The first one second of life on Earth.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.560
You don't know where you are.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.240
You can't choose where you're born.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.160
I was born in Whitley Estate 
in Reading, right?

19:54.320 --> 19:55.720
I wouldn't have chosen that.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.440
I'd have chosen Hampstead. 
I did choose Hampstead.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.880
It just took 45 years to be able 
to afford it.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.320
Very different. Very different,

20:07.400 --> 20:09.760
my upbringing to how I live now.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.320
Now I live a privileged life.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.880
Hampstead is ridiculous. 
It's a rarefied place.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.760
It's like the grandchildren 
of poets and painters

20:17.840 --> 20:19.800
and me, new money, right?

20:19.880 --> 20:22.240
But, growing up, it was tough!

20:22.320 --> 20:26.120
I don't know about now, but in my day,
my estate was rough and scary.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.640
It felt like wildlife.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.520
I was weak and vulnerable.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.720
There was danger round every corner.

20:31.800 --> 20:35.040
My school was on my street
and I ran there every day,

20:35.120 --> 20:37.080
so I didn't get mugged or molested.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.920
There weren't many pedophiles in Reading,
the murderers had killed a lot.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.040
But there was still a couple.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.560
I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god!
There's no crime!

20:47.640 --> 20:49.560
I saw a knife once in Hampstead.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.000
It was a palette knife.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.960
Just a bloke, oil painting,
in the middle of the street.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.800
Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it
or calling him "bender". It was weird!

21:02.800 --> 21:05.440
I know my life has changed drastically,

21:05.520 --> 21:06.760
It wasn't always like that.

21:06.840 --> 21:10.200
As a famous person,
you read about yourself.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.960
Gossip and Twitter and everything.

21:13.040 --> 21:16.560
One thing kept cropping up,
even as I prepared for this tour.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.920
People kept saying, 
"He's out of touch.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.800
He's so famous. He's rich.
He's mega-rich."

21:21.880 --> 21:23.480
I am. Right?

21:25.880 --> 21:28.240
I could have this place burnt down
for a laugh.

21:33.440 --> 21:37.120
No, but they say things like,
"He's an observational comedian.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.280
How can he say things that relate
to ordinary...

21:40.360 --> 21:41.320
scum."

21:41.400 --> 21:42.480
And I say..

21:43.960 --> 21:46.280
I say, "Don't call them scum, right?"

21:47.040 --> 21:50.320
But even the papers, they try and...
get around to it.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.600
I do interviews and they'll always say,

21:53.480 --> 21:55.120
"Do you always fly first class?"

21:55.200 --> 21:58.400
I go, "No. Often private." Right?

21:59.720 --> 22:03.240
The number of times I've answered
this question. They say,

22:03.320 --> 22:04.960
"Do you know how much a pint of milk is?"

22:05.360 --> 22:07.240
To make you look out of touch.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.360
I don't know, but that's irrelevant.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.560
Next time a journalist asks me,
I'll say, "I don't know.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.640
But here's a grand. Run and get me one."

22:16.840 --> 22:19.600
Is that enough? That enough? Yeah.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.880
Another question I always get,

22:24.960 --> 22:28.400
particularly with the posh Sundays,
doing a profile piece.

22:28.480 --> 22:32.000
They're still trying to alienate you,
make you look different.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.440
They say things like,

22:34.320 --> 22:35.880
"You don't have children." I say, "No."

22:35.960 --> 22:37.640
"Why don't you have children?"

22:37.720 --> 22:39.320
Which is an odd question.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.880
Why don't you have children?

22:40.960 --> 22:43.960
As opposed to asking people, 
"Why do you have children?"

22:44.840 --> 22:48.600
Let's ask the fat lady in the leggings
why she's had eight, shall we?

22:50.680 --> 22:53.240
Nine! That one just fell out.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.600
That one didn't even touch the sides.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.600
Or... disturb her cigarette. 
That one just...

23:01.560 --> 23:02.920
Go and claim for that.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.680
People say it's selfish 
to not have children.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.640
How is it selfish to not bring a life 
into the world

23:13.720 --> 23:15.560
that doesn't exist on any level?

23:15.640 --> 23:19.280
There's not a cabinet full of potential
ghost fetuses going,

23:19.360 --> 23:21.240
"We want to be born!" Right?

23:23.760 --> 23:27.480
But I've thought about it and there's 
three reasons I don't have children.

23:27.560 --> 23:30.160
Three main reasons and I'll share them
with you.

23:30.720 --> 23:31.960
Three reasons.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.440
One. There's millions!

23:35.520 --> 23:39.160
The world's over-populated. 
No-one's going, "Rick's not having kids.

23:39.240 --> 23:40.920
We're gonna run out. Fuck."

23:43.040 --> 23:46.400
Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren't they?

23:46.480 --> 23:49.960
I mean, from day one, 
it's all "me, me, me", isn't it?

23:50.040 --> 23:51.440
"Feed me."

23:52.000 --> 23:53.160
"Clothe me."

23:53.880 --> 23:55.760
"Pay for my chemotherapy."

23:56.720 --> 23:57.760
No...

24:03.320 --> 24:04.280
No.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.360
Not my problem, son. Not mine.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.680
Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw.

24:15.640 --> 24:20.160
It costs the average household 
in the West $200,000 to bring up a child.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.120
And they don't want to pay you back.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.480
They're not grateful.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.400
They don't go, "Thanks for having me."
It's "I didn't wanna be born."

24:27.120 --> 24:29.360
Even if they get a top job,
which they won't,

24:31.680 --> 24:33.400
you'll never see that money back.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.600
They'll just put you in a home, okay?

24:35.680 --> 24:36.960
And my kid,

24:37.040 --> 24:40.680
he'd be born into ridiculous wealth, 
wouldn't he? So...

24:43.680 --> 24:45.320
He'd be a little cunt.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.240
A little Hampstead cunt...

24:56.120 --> 24:59.280
running around with all the other 
fucking little Hampstead cunts,

24:59.760 --> 25:01.280
being all Hampstead and cunty.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.800
"I'm a little Hampstead cunt." 
Yes, I know.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.520
"These are my cunty friends." 
I know, it's obvious.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.960
I can tell 
from your little fucking cunty hats

25:09.040 --> 25:12.760
that you're little Hampstead cunts,
you little posh Hampstead...

25:12.840 --> 25:15.400
First, he'd know 
he was a little Hampstead cunt.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.200
"I'm a little..." Yes, we know.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.720
Everyone knows, right?

25:18.800 --> 25:20.320
He'd know that, right?

25:20.400 --> 25:24.480
On the other hand, he'd know he'd never
live up to being as brilliant as his dad.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.960
I'd say, "I worked my way up from nothing,

25:28.040 --> 25:30.360
and you're just a useless Hampstead cunt."

25:30.440 --> 25:34.760
He'd go, "Yeah." And that would 
probably prey on his little mind a bit.

25:34.840 --> 25:38.520
Eleven, twelve, he'd be naughty, 
run with the wrong crowd,

25:38.600 --> 25:40.680
try and get out from under my shadow.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.720
Then he'd turn to drugs. 
About 30, he'd come home,

25:43.800 --> 25:45.400
and overdose on my Afghan rug.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.880
Twenty grand, that was, right?

25:48.840 --> 25:51.080
And as he was there, convulsing,

25:51.200 --> 25:53.840
and throwing up his fucking lungs, right,

25:53.920 --> 25:58.200
and with his little posh, high-pitched,
fucking death rattle...

25:59.520 --> 26:01.800
his little fucking dying words,

26:01.880 --> 26:04.200
he'd go, "Do you love me now, Daddy?"

26:04.280 --> 26:05.120
No!

26:05.680 --> 26:06.520
No.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.480
No, I never did. 
That's why you'll never be born,

26:10.560 --> 26:12.920
you useless, fucking junkie, 
Hampstead cunt.

26:24.680 --> 26:25.920
And, three...

26:29.000 --> 26:31.360
I'd worry sick about him. You know?

26:32.360 --> 26:35.720
No I would! I've only got a cat now
and I worry sick about her.

26:35.880 --> 26:39.760
I check the door three times
when I go out, so she doesn't escape.

26:39.840 --> 26:44.120
I put food and water in every room
in case the door shuts and she's peckish.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.160
A human baby? Oh my god,

26:47.240 --> 26:49.400
the responsibility of a human life?

26:49.480 --> 26:51.600
I'd watch it sleep. You know?

26:51.680 --> 26:54.760
We said how weak and vulnerable
they are.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.920
Oh, my god! You perfect little thing.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.200
Oh, you flesh of my flesh.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.600
Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot,
like that.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.280
Night, night. Sleep tight.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.280
Don't let the bedbugs...

27:09.200 --> 27:10.040
Dead.

27:17.000 --> 27:17.840
Yeah.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.640
Just...

27:21.520 --> 27:23.880
Why? Why is it dead?

27:24.320 --> 27:26.120
It's just fucking dead, look!

27:31.200 --> 27:32.280
Fuck's sake!

27:37.680 --> 27:38.680
Fucking hell.

27:38.760 --> 27:42.840
What the... 
What a fucking waste of time that was!

27:44.600 --> 27:45.960
Fuck's sake.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.760
Embarrassing. "Jane?"

27:52.360 --> 27:53.760
-"What?"
-"Come here."

27:53.840 --> 27:55.720
-"I'm in the shower."
-"Come here."

27:55.800 --> 27:56.680
"What?"

27:57.360 --> 27:58.600
"Fucking dead already.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.320
I didn't... Just fucking...

28:01.000 --> 28:02.440
Fucking hell, Jane.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.200
You call that a baby? That is..."

28:09.160 --> 28:11.960
If Jane was out, I'd have to text her,
wouldn't I?

28:13.240 --> 28:14.320
What could you...

28:15.120 --> 28:16.120
"Baby's dead."

28:17.720 --> 28:19.720
She'd come back. "What the fuck?"

28:20.480 --> 28:21.720
I'd go, "Yep...

28:22.800 --> 28:24.400
Forget the Pampers. LOL."

28:32.320 --> 28:35.480
But even if it made it through
the terrifying cot years,

28:35.880 --> 28:37.760
and it was a toddler running around

28:37.840 --> 28:41.240
head height to my antique tables,
with their sharp edges.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.960
I'd have to pad them so it didn't
run into it, cave its head in and die.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.240
Then Social Services come round and say,

28:47.320 --> 28:49.000
"Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?"

28:49.080 --> 28:50.640
-"Yeah."
-"What happened here, then?"

28:50.720 --> 28:52.440
I go, "It's a fucking idiot."

28:55.840 --> 28:57.640
I did think of adopting for a while.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.400
A little third world child.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.640
Because that would tick all three boxes.

29:02.800 --> 29:06.120
One, I wouldn't be
adding to the population problem.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.160
I'd be alleviating an existing problem.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.840
A young kid born, through no fault
of his own,

29:10.920 --> 29:13.200
into abject poverty, he would have died,

29:13.280 --> 29:15.240
I can literally save his life,

29:15.320 --> 29:17.280
and give him a great upbringing.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.560
Right? Two.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.600
He would be grateful, wouldn't he?

29:20.680 --> 29:22.960
He'd wanna pay me back, woudn't he?

29:23.040 --> 29:27.480
Particularly if I let him know the other
kids in the village weren't so lucky.

29:27.560 --> 29:31.040
They didn't... They didn't make it out.
Right?

29:32.160 --> 29:33.560
I'd tell him that early on,

29:33.640 --> 29:35.600
so he really bucked his ideas up.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.960
I'd go, "Tunde, come here.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.360
Come here.

29:41.440 --> 29:42.520
Yeah, yeah.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.600
Go and pop a shirt on, 
you're not in Africa now.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.720
That's better. Yeah.

29:51.800 --> 29:55.920
Tunde, look-- Yeah! 
Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes!

29:56.800 --> 29:57.640
Yeah.

29:57.720 --> 29:58.560
Yeah!

29:58.640 --> 30:01.760
No, it's not free.
It's Hampstead, you know, but...

30:01.840 --> 30:03.520
Yeah, course it's safe.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.680
Safe, fresh drinking water.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.520
Have as much as you want.
Have a bucket full.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.400
Fresh drinking water. There you go.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.360
Go and clean the car. Go on."

30:17.760 --> 30:19.000
No, I'd go, "Look.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.480
Remember all your friends
in the village back in Africa?

30:22.560 --> 30:23.480
They're all dead.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.880
A rich man didn't save them 
and bring them to Hampstead.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.520
-Do you wanna pay me back?" 
-"Yeah."

30:30.600 --> 30:32.120
"Yeah, I bet you do."

30:33.120 --> 30:34.720
The good thing about them is,

30:34.800 --> 30:37.800
they can start work
when they're about... six.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.560
I just call up Nike and I go...

30:43.120 --> 30:46.000
"Do you still make your stuff 
in sweatshops?

30:46.080 --> 30:48.520
Got a great little worker here, yeah.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.040
Pound a day's fine.
He's gotta start somewhere.

30:51.720 --> 30:53.080
And, three...

30:53.160 --> 30:56.640
if he ran round and caved his head in...
and died,

30:56.720 --> 31:00.760
and Social Services came round and said,
"Is this your child, Mr Gervais?"

31:00.840 --> 31:02.840
I'd go, "Does it look like mine?"

31:06.360 --> 31:07.240
I'd go...

31:08.200 --> 31:10.600
"This is Hampstead. 
It's obviously broken in."

31:17.560 --> 31:19.120
That's why I don't have kids.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.680
Even though I don't have children 
of my own,

31:24.400 --> 31:27.360
people still show me photos of theirs,
like I give a shit.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.760
I don't mean my own family.

31:29.840 --> 31:30.840
They've given up.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.800
I've got older brothers and sisters.
They've had loads of kids.

31:33.880 --> 31:36.880
And their kids have kids, 
and then their kids!

31:36.960 --> 31:38.000
There's about 50.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.600
I don't know all their names. 
I see them at Christmas.

31:41.680 --> 31:44.080
It's all "Uncle Ricky!" 
They know I've got a bit of cash.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.200
They go through my pockets,
and then fuck off.

31:47.320 --> 31:49.680
It's like being mugged by mice, right?

31:50.480 --> 31:52.560
I don't mean them, I mean strangers.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.880
I could be busy, I could be working,

31:54.960 --> 31:58.160
like on the set of a TV or film 
or something,

31:58.240 --> 32:00.520
stressed, producing or directing it.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.720
You get someone who's in for one day,

32:02.800 --> 32:04.600
with one line, or a stuntman,

32:04.680 --> 32:06.200
they introduce themselves.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.880
"Good. Be with you in a minute."
Then they hover.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.840
-"Busy?"
-I go, "Yeah! Yes. Yeah."

32:12.920 --> 32:14.960
They go, "Working the weekend?"

32:15.040 --> 32:17.880
I go, "Not filming, 
but I'll be in the edit."

32:17.960 --> 32:20.440
"I'm taking my youngest 
to ballet lessons."

32:20.520 --> 32:22.000
"Ah. Great.

32:22.080 --> 32:22.920
Great."

32:23.480 --> 32:24.920
"Yeah, she's eight."

32:28.600 --> 32:29.960
"I've got a photograph."

32:30.040 --> 32:33.040
I go, "You know what?
Show me it if she goes missing.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.640
I'll keep an eye open in the woods."

32:50.280 --> 32:53.640
You've gotta go through
the whole polite rigmarole, and go,

32:55.840 --> 32:57.040
"She's beautiful."

32:59.040 --> 33:02.040
It's gotta be long. Too short, 
it's awkward. They know.

33:02.120 --> 33:03.640
You go, "Yeah, right."

33:03.720 --> 33:05.720
Too long and it's like,

33:16.840 --> 33:17.800
"She's...

33:18.520 --> 33:20.120
She's fucking beautiful."

33:20.640 --> 33:22.960
It's a minefield, innit?

33:23.440 --> 33:24.280
So...

33:30.680 --> 33:33.080
I'm not out of touch. But I am spoiled.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.400
There's a difference.
I didn't have any money until I was 40.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.560
I've got the same family, friends
and values.

33:39.640 --> 33:40.880
But I am spoiled.

33:40.960 --> 33:44.120
Because opportunity and privilege 
spoils you.

33:44.200 --> 33:47.160
And it doesn't take much.
I'l give you an example.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.280
When I first made it in America,

33:49.360 --> 33:50.520
the next time we flew,

33:50.600 --> 33:52.840
we're met by a bloke in a suit
and a thing.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.000
And he just walked us past the queue

33:55.080 --> 33:57.080
and straight out the other side.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.120
The first time, you're horrified.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.680
"Everyone's looking." 
Pretending to be late, baseball cap.

34:02.760 --> 34:03.600
Oh, god.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.560
Next time we flew, I went, 
"Where's that bloke?

34:06.640 --> 34:07.840
I'm not queueing!"

34:08.320 --> 34:09.600
It's quick!

34:10.480 --> 34:13.000
When I fly to the States, I've got
a place there,

34:13.080 --> 34:14.360
but I'm always working.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.200
So, someone else is paying.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.200
So, I go first class. BA.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.760
It doesn't get any better.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.600
Even if I was paying,
I'd still go first class,

34:22.680 --> 34:25.240
but Jane would probably be in coach...

34:26.400 --> 34:28.040
It's ten grand a pop!

34:28.120 --> 34:31.520
That new Planet of the Apes movie's on. 
She'll love that.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.040
She'll be up for that.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.920
But when someone else is paying,

34:37.000 --> 34:38.960
I say, 
"Jane, get up here with me." Right?

34:39.480 --> 34:41.480
Front two seats...

34:41.560 --> 34:43.080
They board us early.

34:43.160 --> 34:46.480
We're on the plane
about 15 minutes before anyone else. God.

34:46.560 --> 34:51.000
They bring round these snacks, 
these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.880
Champagne. It's great.
It's like a day off.

34:53.960 --> 34:57.520
No phone or anything. It's like a holiday,
flying to the States.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.560
I could do without the safety video.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.080
That's always a bit of a downer.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.960
And totally pointless.

35:04.040 --> 35:07.160
If you hit the side of a mountain 
at 500 miles per hour,

35:07.920 --> 35:10.400
the brace position does fuck all.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.000
Imagine if that worked.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.360
You're going down, the plane smashes.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.520
You go, "I'll try it." You do that.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.320
Ball of flames, you wake up,
everyone's dead.

35:23.400 --> 35:26.360
You go, "Fucking hell, 
that's amazing, that is!"

35:32.600 --> 35:35.000
And they always use that voice, 
don't they?

35:36.800 --> 35:39.840
That calming, hypnotic voice, 
like, "Nothing bad will happen."

35:39.920 --> 35:43.040
They're saying horrendous things, 
but nothing bad will happen,

35:43.120 --> 35:45.520
because I'm using this voice, don't worry.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.840
Things like, "In the event 
of the plane landing on water--"

35:48.920 --> 35:51.480
It smashes the fuck to bits, right?

35:52.560 --> 35:55.360
They say, "In the event of the plane
landing on water,

35:55.440 --> 35:58.160
your life jacket is equipped 
with a whistle."

35:59.240 --> 36:01.400
A fucking whistle.

36:01.480 --> 36:04.760
So, the plane hits the water, 
smashes to bits,

36:04.840 --> 36:07.640
everyone's dead, except you, by a miracle.

36:07.720 --> 36:10.040
You're bobbing around 
in the Atlantic Ocean.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.000
Four degrees, that water is.

36:12.080 --> 36:16.280
You've got about 15 minutes
before hypothermia sets in.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.520
Or you're eaten by a shark, or you drown.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.920
You're hoping they've sent air-sea rescue.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.960
You're going, "God, I'm gonna die, 
I don't know what I'm doing!"

36:25.040 --> 36:25.880
Hold on!

36:36.080 --> 36:37.760
I mean, Air Sea Rescue...

36:37.840 --> 36:40.480
I don't know if you've ever been in 
a helicopter.

36:40.560 --> 36:41.960
O course you haven't. But...

36:43.440 --> 36:45.160
They're fucking loud.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.760
It's like having your head 
in a washing machine.

36:47.840 --> 36:52.040
You have to wear ear plugs and defenders.
Your teeth rattle. It's like...

36:54.480 --> 36:57.120
Like that. 
Over the Atlantic Ocean at night.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.800
Never gonna happen.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.960
If you crash, you die, right?

37:16.680 --> 37:19.040
But apart from that, it's brilliant. 
Right...

37:19.760 --> 37:23.600
I was flying Heathrow to JFK
just before Christmas, right?

37:23.680 --> 37:25.560
Boarded us early, on the plane.

37:25.640 --> 37:26.800
She comes round.

37:26.880 --> 37:30.040
"Champagne in a wine glass, 
like you like it, Mr. Gervais."

37:30.120 --> 37:31.000
She goes off.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.840
I go, "Have you got any 
of them warm nuts?"

37:33.920 --> 37:37.040
She went, "We're not handing out nuts 
on this flight.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.520
A lady's getting on who's so allergic,

37:39.600 --> 37:42.000
even someone eating nuts nearby

37:42.080 --> 37:44.360
would cause her to have a fatal reaction."

37:44.440 --> 37:46.600
I went, "Oh, my god, of course."

37:46.680 --> 37:48.960
I was fuming. I mean...

37:49.840 --> 37:51.440
What's that got to do with me?

37:51.520 --> 37:53.360
Why can't I eat nuts, just cause...

37:53.440 --> 37:55.640
fucking... this woman will... die, right?

37:56.800 --> 37:58.800
Nuts! How has she lived this long?

37:58.880 --> 38:03.000
If walking by a nut kills you...

38:03.080 --> 38:06.320
if being... just near a nut...

38:06.400 --> 38:08.800
How has she never been near a nut...

38:09.600 --> 38:10.440
before?

38:10.520 --> 38:12.840
And how has she lived long enough,

38:12.920 --> 38:15.000
having never been near a nut,

38:15.080 --> 38:18.160
how has she lived long enough
to earn enough money

38:18.240 --> 38:20.600
to be near me on a plane, right?

38:21.840 --> 38:23.200
Honestly. It's...

38:24.960 --> 38:27.640
And if being near a nut kills you,

38:27.720 --> 38:30.920
do we really want that in the gene pool? 
I mean...

38:31.760 --> 38:33.280
I never wanted nuts more.

38:33.360 --> 38:37.120
I felt she was infringing 
on my human right to eat nuts.

38:38.120 --> 38:40.720
And this is how spoiled I am, okay?

38:40.800 --> 38:42.280
I actually had this thought.

38:42.360 --> 38:45.600
I thought, "Oh, I wish 
I'd brought my own nuts on."

38:45.680 --> 38:46.520
Right?.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.600
I thought for a second,
but that wouldn't work.

38:50.680 --> 38:54.280
She'd get on and start blowing up 
like a frog, right?

38:54.360 --> 38:55.440
Like that...

38:56.640 --> 38:58.200
And... die.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.680
And someone would go, 
"Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on."

39:02.160 --> 39:03.360
You know, right?

39:03.440 --> 39:05.640
So I don't take my own nuts on.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.080
Now, before I fly,

39:07.160 --> 39:10.440
I have a shower, 
and then I rub myself all over...

39:10.520 --> 39:12.960
in nuts... just in case.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.280
Then I go, "Can I have any nuts?"

39:15.360 --> 39:17.520
They go, "No, sorry, this lady would die."

39:17.600 --> 39:19.000
"Yeah, not a problem."

39:19.080 --> 39:22.640
Lady gets on, sits down, 
starts blowing up like a frog...

39:24.160 --> 39:26.640
I go, "What's the matter?" 
I touch her all over.

39:31.800 --> 39:36.000
"What's the matter?"
She goes, "Nuts!" Right? And dies.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.440
And I go, "Who's been eating nuts?"

39:41.080 --> 39:42.600
I get off scot-free.

39:43.520 --> 39:46.160
So I got to America, 
I went on a chat show.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.440
Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.440
And I told that story, the whole thing.

39:51.520 --> 39:54.440
It went well, audience laughed. Great. 
Went out.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.400
Next day on Twitter, outrage.

39:56.480 --> 40:00.400
By "outrage", I mean one person going,
"How dare you?"

40:00.480 --> 40:05.840
This woman goes, "I saw you on Jimmy 
Fallon, making fun of nut allergies.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.440
My daughter's nut-intolerant. 
How dare you?"

40:08.680 --> 40:10.240
I go, "Who is this woman?"

40:10.320 --> 40:14.120
She's tweeted 15 times. 
She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.440
I go, "What's this? 
How many followers?

40:16.520 --> 40:17.840
Twenty-three. Ignore it."

40:19.240 --> 40:23.240
You know when you're being told off,
and they use your own words against you,

40:23.320 --> 40:26.200
like a teacher going, 
"So, you find so and so funny?"

40:26.280 --> 40:28.320
And cause the teacher's really angry,

40:28.400 --> 40:31.200
yes, you do find that thing funny,
whatever...

40:31.280 --> 40:32.640
She said...

40:32.720 --> 40:35.800
"Would you find it funny if my daughter
blew up like a frog?"

40:38.320 --> 40:39.200
Yeah.

40:39.720 --> 40:42.000
Yeah, you saying that... Yes.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.800
If you said that at the funeral, 
I would, yeah...

40:46.400 --> 40:49.000
So, someone else gets involved.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.600
Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right?

40:51.680 --> 40:55.280
And she does a blog, 
and they're talking to each other,

40:55.360 --> 40:59.000
and she puts me in her blog
about how disgusting I am.

40:59.080 --> 41:02.920
One filmed her little girl,
put it on YouTube, and sent me it.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.760
I opened it. 
Sweet little girl, seven years old.

41:05.840 --> 41:09.800
And she went, "Dear Mr. Gervais,
I have a fatal nut allergy."

41:09.880 --> 41:10.720
Delete.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.600
Not my problem, right?

41:16.960 --> 41:19.600
Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right?

41:19.680 --> 41:22.760
But then one of them said something
that reeled me in.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.400
Just cause I'm this 
self-confessed Twitter police.

41:26.040 --> 41:30.000
I try and explain to someone every day
what freedom of speech means,

41:30.080 --> 41:32.240
particularly in the context of comedy,

41:32.320 --> 41:34.040
and in the context of a joke.

41:34.120 --> 41:37.600
A joke about a bad thing
isn't as bad as the bad thing,

41:37.680 --> 41:39.640
or necessarily condoning the bad thing.

41:39.720 --> 41:41.320
It could be anti the bad thing.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.440
It depends on the actual joke.

41:43.520 --> 41:44.840
And this woman said...

41:45.400 --> 41:48.000
"You should never make jokes
about food allergies."

41:50.040 --> 41:52.080
I should have left it, right?

41:53.880 --> 41:57.240
I sent back, "I make jokes 
about AIDS, cancer,

41:57.320 --> 41:59.240
famine, and the Holocaust.

41:59.320 --> 42:03.000
And you're telling me I should never
joke about food allergies?"

42:04.280 --> 42:07.840
She sent back, "Yes, but the Holocaust 
didn't kill children."

42:07.920 --> 42:08.880
Well...

42:11.400 --> 42:12.680
it did, didn't it?

42:14.160 --> 42:16.120
It was horrible, the Holocaust.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.560
Some would say as bad as food allergies.

42:22.320 --> 42:24.560
"Didn't kill children..." Jesus.

42:26.880 --> 42:28.120
It did kill children.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.960
Hitler killed 12 million people,
many of them children.

42:31.640 --> 42:34.480
I have to say, Hitler,
you couldn't make him up.

42:34.560 --> 42:37.200
The worst human being
to walk the face of the Earth.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.600
He is a crazy...

42:38.920 --> 42:39.840
evil,

42:40.240 --> 42:41.240
racist,

42:41.320 --> 42:43.640
narcissistic serial killer.

42:43.720 --> 42:45.120
Just terrible.

42:45.920 --> 42:46.800
But...

42:49.920 --> 42:51.760
if I was throwing a dinner party,

42:52.760 --> 42:54.880
and I'd been slaving over a hot stove,

42:54.960 --> 42:56.960
and I was getting everything ready,

42:57.040 --> 42:58.880
and there was one place left,

42:58.960 --> 43:01.560
and I had to... either invite Hitler

43:01.640 --> 43:03.760
or that little girl with food allergies...

43:10.240 --> 43:12.440
I know who'd ruin that party more.

43:13.400 --> 43:16.400
Everyone's enjoying it. "Everything okay?"
"Ja, ist yummy!"

43:16.480 --> 43:18.080
Right? He's loving it.

43:18.160 --> 43:21.240
I go, "Cheers, you fucker! 
How you doing, boy?"

43:22.240 --> 43:24.720
She's going, "I can't eat that." 
Fucking hell.

43:26.320 --> 43:27.680
"Who wants Ferrero Rocher?"

43:27.760 --> 43:28.640
"Me!"

43:28.720 --> 43:30.080
"All right. Here!"

43:31.080 --> 43:33.280
"I can't eat them." Oh, fuck off home.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.240
Right?

43:35.680 --> 43:37.400
That's what the world's like.

43:37.480 --> 43:40.640
People see something they don't like,
they expect it to stop,

43:40.720 --> 43:42.920
as opposed to deal with their emotions.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.880
They want us to care about their thing
as much as they do.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.800
It's why the world is getting worse,

43:47.880 --> 43:49.880
and the world is getting worse.

43:50.600 --> 43:53.120
I think I've lived through
the best 50 years of humanity...

43:53.920 --> 43:57.720
1965 to 2015, the peak of civlization,
for everything.

43:57.800 --> 44:01.880
For tolerances, for freedoms,
for communication, for medicine.

44:01.960 --> 44:03.600
Now it's going the other way a bit.

44:03.680 --> 44:06.600
Last couple of years,
just a little blip, maybe.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.520
I'm not saying this because I'm old.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.240
Old people say things like,

44:11.000 --> 44:12.800
"Oh, everything was better
when I was a kid."

44:13.280 --> 44:14.440
Course it was. You were a kid.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.000
Everything's better when you're a kid.

44:17.200 --> 44:18.880
Being old is the shit bit.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.320
Whatever's happening, being old is...

44:21.480 --> 44:25.440
I wake up these days, and I go, 
"Oh fuck, I didn't die."

44:27.560 --> 44:29.040
Gotta do it all again.

44:29.120 --> 44:32.000
I'm usually hung over,
headache, liver pains.

44:32.080 --> 44:34.040
I can't walk for the first five minutes,

44:34.120 --> 44:36.160
'cause I've got no joints in my knees.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.880
I'm getting fat again now, right?

44:38.960 --> 44:42.840
I was thin till I was about 28, proper 
skinny, like nine and a half stone.

44:43.320 --> 44:44.960
Then I got a job, right?

44:45.040 --> 44:48.800
And the next, sort of, 20 years
were what I call my eating years...

44:49.960 --> 44:52.280
And I just got steadily fatter and fatter.

44:52.360 --> 44:55.440
Until I reached a peak of unwellness
and blobbiness,

44:55.640 --> 44:57.760
when I was about 48 years old.

44:57.840 --> 45:00.920
There was one Christmas, I was at home,
lying on the floor...

45:01.520 --> 45:02.400
And...

45:03.400 --> 45:04.680
I was saying to Jane,

45:04.760 --> 45:07.080
"I'm having a heart attack." Right?

45:07.800 --> 45:10.920
And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.520
I felt nauseous, I had palpitations,
I was sweating.

45:14.600 --> 45:16.840
Because I'd eaten eleven sausages.

45:21.280 --> 45:22.840
True story, right?

45:23.360 --> 45:25.080
I was like one of them snakes.

45:25.160 --> 45:27.280
Like when you see a big, like...

45:27.360 --> 45:30.320
python swallow a pig whole.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.960
And then it's just fucked.

45:32.040 --> 45:34.440
It's, like... it'll sit there for a week.

45:34.520 --> 45:36.920
It's like a duffel bag. 
Just there, like that.

45:37.400 --> 45:39.120
That was me, right?

45:39.200 --> 45:42.360
I wasn't having a heart attack,
but it worried Jane.

45:42.440 --> 45:46.120
She said, "You gotta look after yourself."
I thought, "You're right. 48."

45:46.520 --> 45:49.120
So I started working out, right, 
every day.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.600
I didn't give anything up.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.000
I don't eat meat anymore.

45:52.120 --> 45:54.800
But I was
having 2500, 3000 calories a day,

45:54.880 --> 45:56.720
including wine every night.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.600
But I burnt it off the next day.

45:58.680 --> 46:00.280
Just so I could do all that,

46:00.360 --> 46:03.320
I worked out every day, 
running, weight training...

46:03.400 --> 46:06.160
I had more time on my hands 
than the average person.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.760
I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse.

46:08.840 --> 46:10.840
I lost 20 pounds. It was great.

46:10.920 --> 46:13.280
But now, I still eat and drink too much,

46:13.360 --> 46:17.360
but I physically can't... burn off 
the calories. I can't do enough.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.800
Cause I'm so old and broken and tired.

46:19.880 --> 46:23.080
So, I'm going to get steadily
fatter and fatter again,

46:23.160 --> 46:25.280
and this time I am going to die.

46:27.840 --> 46:30.720
I'm losing my hair.
It's getting really thin.

46:30.800 --> 46:33.320
I know it looks great from there.
Cheers, but...

46:34.680 --> 46:36.680
No, honestly, in a lift,

46:36.760 --> 46:39.400
with that light directly overhead,

46:39.480 --> 46:42.560
and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, 
right?

46:45.040 --> 46:48.560
I'll have to buzz that off soon.
I'd never wear a wig, oh, my god.

46:48.640 --> 46:52.560
If you wear a wig or a toupee, 
and you think you've got away with it...

46:53.560 --> 46:54.720
you haven't.

46:54.800 --> 46:56.280
Everyone knows.

46:56.360 --> 46:58.280
Everyone knows immediately.

46:58.360 --> 47:02.640
My brain knows a wig has come 
into the room before I do, right?

47:03.680 --> 47:06.480
I could be at a party,
it'll go, "There's a wig in here."

47:06.560 --> 47:09.120
-I go. "Is there?"
-"Yes! There is, yeah!"

47:10.320 --> 47:12.480
Spidey senses for the wig.

47:12.560 --> 47:13.400
It's obvious.

47:14.120 --> 47:16.480
The way they smile, 
like nothing's wrong.

47:16.560 --> 47:17.400
Hiya.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.520
It's the telltale signs, isn't it?

47:22.520 --> 47:25.480
I was put off wigs for life
by my Uncle Reginald.

47:25.560 --> 47:29.640
Great bloke. He's dead now.
Died a few years ago. I was only little.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.520
He went bald in his twenties.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.800
Tragically bald. His hair fell out.

47:33.880 --> 47:36.600
It might have been something like alopecia

47:36.680 --> 47:40.160
But he was bald for ten years
into his thirties.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.080
Turns up one day at our house...

47:42.160 --> 47:44.000
"Elvis! What is--"

47:46.640 --> 47:47.800
I was about eight,

47:47.880 --> 47:50.680
I said to Auntie Edna, "What happened?"
She went,

47:50.760 --> 47:53.120
"It was a miracle."

47:53.200 --> 47:55.080
They were lying! They were just...

47:55.160 --> 47:57.280
Everyone knew he was bald!

47:57.520 --> 48:01.200
But he'd embroiled his family in the lie,
so they had to lie as well.

48:01.320 --> 48:03.640
They're going, "Yeah, it just grew back."

48:03.720 --> 48:07.880
There's so much he wouldn't do, cause
he was terrified of the wig coming off.

48:08.800 --> 48:11.680
We weren't allowed balloons at parties, 
right?

48:12.400 --> 48:16.200
Auntie Edna said, "Reg is allergic 
to balloons." He wasn't allergic.

48:16.280 --> 48:19.880
He was terrified one of us kids
would rub one on our sweater,

48:20.760 --> 48:22.760
and his wig would fly across the room.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.040
We've got photos in the family album.

48:27.120 --> 48:30.680
If he's at a wedding or a christening,
and he's holding a baby,

48:30.760 --> 48:32.400
it's always at arms' length.

48:32.480 --> 48:34.760
Like that. So it can't grab his wig.

48:34.840 --> 48:38.080
It must have been on his mind 
all the time, right?

48:38.160 --> 48:41.520
It was the only thing he feared,
the wig coming off in public,

48:41.600 --> 48:43.640
and this ridiculous lie being exposed.

48:43.720 --> 48:45.800
He was in the Army, hard as nails.

48:45.880 --> 48:48.960
He wasn't scared of anyone or anything.
Spiders, snakes...

48:49.040 --> 48:50.200
cancer...

48:50.280 --> 48:51.840
How's the chemo going, Uncle?

48:51.920 --> 48:53.240
"Not a problem."

48:56.000 --> 48:58.840
We've got a photo of him, 
the last year, I think.

48:58.920 --> 49:02.280
He was 75. It must have been
the last year he was alive.

49:02.360 --> 49:04.640
It was a hot day. He was in the garden.

49:04.720 --> 49:06.080
In his little trunks.

49:06.160 --> 49:08.280
He was a wizened little man by then.

49:08.360 --> 49:11.240
White chest hair. Jet black wig still!

49:12.720 --> 49:14.360
Died in it, buried in it.

49:14.440 --> 49:15.800
He's wearing it now.

49:16.720 --> 49:19.320
A little skeleton with jet black hair.

49:21.200 --> 49:23.280
Like Posh Spice for eternity.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.680
But I knew that was gonna happen.

49:28.160 --> 49:30.400
I knew I would get old and fat and...

49:30.480 --> 49:32.840
ill and blind and deaf and...

49:33.400 --> 49:36.720
shit myself and be pushed round
in a fucking bucket.

49:38.400 --> 49:42.120
You're ready, because you're warned.
You know about getting old.

49:42.200 --> 49:45.120
What they don't talk about,
so you're not prepared,

49:45.200 --> 49:47.000
and it was a shock to me...

49:47.080 --> 49:50.080
I only found out recently, 
I'll share it with you now.

49:50.960 --> 49:52.520
The distending testicles.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.400
See, you don't know about it.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.480
But it happens in your fifties.

49:57.560 --> 49:59.920
I wasn't checking them or anything...

50:00.000 --> 50:01.720
I didn't see 'em for 20 years.

50:03.400 --> 50:05.000
As a young man, they were pert,

50:05.080 --> 50:07.200
and now they're like two plums in a sock.

50:07.960 --> 50:09.720
I don't know when it happened,

50:09.800 --> 50:11.960
but it was recently. They just...

50:12.040 --> 50:14.000
And this is how I found out.

50:14.080 --> 50:16.080
So, as I've been getting older,

50:16.160 --> 50:18.600
and they've been secretly 
stretching away...

50:19.200 --> 50:21.440
as I've got older, I've got richer,

50:21.520 --> 50:24.240
so my baths have been getting
more luxurious.

50:25.720 --> 50:28.440
Last year, I moved into a new house
in Hampstead.

50:28.880 --> 50:30.480
Big bath. Big sunken bath.

50:31.120 --> 50:32.320
South-facing windows.

50:32.400 --> 50:35.120
I was in there the first night. 
Lovely bath.

50:35.200 --> 50:38.360
Sun streaming in, classical music,
this is the life.

50:38.440 --> 50:39.400
I looked down.

50:40.200 --> 50:41.480
And they're floating.

50:42.080 --> 50:42.920
Right?

50:44.440 --> 50:48.000
Now, I'd never dreamt 
that testicles would float.

50:48.320 --> 50:50.040
They seem like they'd be heavy.

50:50.600 --> 50:53.840
You could tie things down with them,
and they'd sink. You know?

50:54.520 --> 50:56.320
Most people never see their...

50:56.400 --> 50:59.480
In the sea, you're in trunks,
in the shower, they dangle,

50:59.560 --> 51:01.320
and baths aren't usually that deep!

51:02.000 --> 51:04.280
That was my first thought. "Oh, my god,

51:04.360 --> 51:06.680
I never thought testicles would float."

51:07.680 --> 51:09.760
Then my second thought kicked in.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.960
"Hold on, this bath's two feet deep!"

51:12.040 --> 51:12.880
Right?

51:14.000 --> 51:16.440
I'm sitting on the bottom, they're on top.

51:16.520 --> 51:17.560
What's going on?

51:18.120 --> 51:18.960
Right?

51:19.040 --> 51:19.880
And...

51:20.680 --> 51:21.520
I looked,

51:21.640 --> 51:24.800
and my testicles are now longer 
than my penis.

51:25.880 --> 51:29.200
Easily, by some way, right?

51:29.280 --> 51:31.040
In fact, they'd created,

51:31.120 --> 51:34.520
a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right?

51:35.360 --> 51:38.760
My penis was dry, just nestled, just...

51:38.840 --> 51:39.960
floating on top.

51:40.040 --> 51:41.520
Like that. Like that.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.320
Just bouncing around.

51:44.680 --> 51:47.120
I should have given it a little whistle.

51:51.400 --> 51:53.400
I'm just thinking, "This is bizarre."

51:53.480 --> 51:54.720
Fucking hell, right?

51:54.920 --> 51:56.040
And...

51:56.120 --> 51:57.760
I thought, "Maybe it's a fluke."

51:57.840 --> 52:01.040
So I held them under the water 
for a minute,

52:01.120 --> 52:03.120
I let them go and they bobbed up!

52:03.200 --> 52:06.600
They're really... 
They're really buoyant, right?

52:06.680 --> 52:09.680
Try it when you get home, 
if you're in your 50s.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.440
And a man, obviously.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.160
Or Caitlyn Jenner.

52:16.840 --> 52:17.680
But...

52:21.640 --> 52:23.560
But the world is getting worse.

52:24.160 --> 52:27.920
And I blame the beginning of its demise
on social media.

52:28.840 --> 52:33.520
Because Twitter and Facebook,
that's where this ridiculous notion bred,

52:33.600 --> 52:35.320
and became stable,

52:35.400 --> 52:38.720
that it was more important to be popular 
than right.

52:38.800 --> 52:42.680
Everything was "like me", "agree with me".
It falls into two tribes.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.160
"I don't agree with them, 
so I block them."

52:45.240 --> 52:47.080
And now, in this post-truth era,

52:47.160 --> 52:49.480
people don't care about the argument,

52:49.560 --> 52:52.080
they say, "Who's saying the argument?

52:52.160 --> 52:53.840
No, they're not on our side."

52:53.920 --> 52:55.520
It's ludicrous, okay?

52:55.880 --> 52:59.280
And it also bred this ridiculous notion
we've always had.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.880
My opinion is worth as much as yours.

53:01.960 --> 53:04.800
Now, it's my opinion is worth
as much as your fact,

53:04.880 --> 53:06.040
which is nonsense.

53:06.120 --> 53:07.800
I get tweets from people saying,

53:08.360 --> 53:10.560
"I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old."

53:10.960 --> 53:12.840
"I believe you're a fucking idiot."

53:13.640 --> 53:16.200
You can't have an opinion 
on the age of the Earth.

53:16.280 --> 53:18.840
You can have opinions, 
but not your own facts.

53:19.160 --> 53:22.040
But it was all about being popular, right?

53:22.120 --> 53:24.880
And even politicians 
picked up those symptoms.

53:24.960 --> 53:27.280
Politicians tweet now,
they want to be popular.

53:27.360 --> 53:30.080
We had a Brexit referendum
cause they passed the buck.

53:30.160 --> 53:32.280
They didn't want to make a mistake.

53:32.360 --> 53:34.160
And there's a ridiculous thing of,

53:34.240 --> 53:36.920
"Let's ask the average person 
what they think."

53:37.000 --> 53:40.240
Let's stop asking the average person 
what they...

53:40.320 --> 53:43.080
Do you know how fucking stupid
the average person is?

53:50.080 --> 53:52.600
We still sell bottles of bleach

53:52.680 --> 53:54.320
with big labels on

53:54.400 --> 53:56.520
that say "Do not drink".

53:56.600 --> 53:57.440
Right?

53:57.520 --> 54:00.080
Let's take those labels off, right?

54:00.680 --> 54:02.120
For two years.

54:02.800 --> 54:04.360
And then have a referendum.

54:13.040 --> 54:16.200
But it's not just politicians. 
Even real news.

54:16.280 --> 54:18.360
The news on TV says things like,

54:18.440 --> 54:19.720
"Tweet us your news."

54:19.800 --> 54:21.720
Don't let them tweet you the news!

54:21.800 --> 54:24.840
-"I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex." 
-You liar! Right?

54:26.680 --> 54:28.560
There was a big news story last year,

54:28.640 --> 54:32.000
about a train crash that happened 
a year before,

54:32.080 --> 54:33.480
and there was an inquiry.

54:33.560 --> 54:35.960
The results of the inquiry were published

54:36.040 --> 54:38.480
and there was an expert on the news.

54:38.560 --> 54:41.040
He said, "We've looked at everything,

54:41.120 --> 54:43.840
and we've decided that the speed 
of the trains

54:43.920 --> 54:45.480
was a contributing factor,

54:45.560 --> 54:47.960
so we're going to slow them down a bit.

54:48.040 --> 54:50.560
Statistically,
this shouldn't happen again."

54:50.640 --> 54:51.840
That would have been it.

54:51.920 --> 54:54.960
But the guy went, "We asked the public 
what they thought."

54:56.560 --> 54:58.720
Then there was three banal vox pops.

54:58.800 --> 55:02.080
First one said, 
"I already pay £960 a year,

55:02.160 --> 55:03.760
so I'm not happy."

55:03.840 --> 55:06.920
The next one said, "It takes me 45 minutes
each way,

55:07.000 --> 55:08.320
it's not good enough."

55:08.400 --> 55:09.880
The last one said,

55:09.960 --> 55:13.320
"I say it's better to arrive at work late 
than dead."

55:16.080 --> 55:18.000
Why is that on the news?

55:18.080 --> 55:20.840
And when is that applicable 
in any situation?

55:22.040 --> 55:23.960
All right, Ted? You're in early.

55:24.680 --> 55:25.520
Ted?

55:29.080 --> 55:30.680
Oh, Ted!

55:32.520 --> 55:33.960
We've been through this.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.720
Remember I said I'd rather you arrive late
than dead?

55:41.200 --> 55:42.760
But... the big enemy

55:43.360 --> 55:45.000
is stupidity... right?

55:45.440 --> 55:48.040
I wanna share with you 
the most stupid tweet I ever got.

55:48.920 --> 55:51.520
Now, admittedly, when I first got 
on Twitter,

55:51.600 --> 55:54.040
I pushed my agenda.
I was an outspoken atheist.

55:54.120 --> 55:56.960
Not to change anyone's opinions.

55:57.200 --> 55:59.920
I thought it was important
to tell the other side.

56:00.240 --> 56:02.560
There are still 13 countries where people

56:02.640 --> 56:04.960
are put to death for being an atheist.

56:05.200 --> 56:08.400
I just wanted to say,
"It's fine to be an atheist.

56:08.480 --> 56:11.280
It's fine to believe in God,
and it's fine not to."

56:11.360 --> 56:13.360
That's all I was saying.

56:13.440 --> 56:15.280
I realized I didn't have to tweet

56:15.360 --> 56:17.040
about religion or atheism.

56:17.120 --> 56:18.080
I could tweet a fact,

56:18.160 --> 56:20.360
and that annoyed
just the right people.

56:22.360 --> 56:24.680
I'd tweet things like "Happy birthday,
Earth.

56:24.760 --> 56:26.800
Four point six billion years old today."

56:26.920 --> 56:28.320
Someone would always go,

56:28.400 --> 56:30.400
"We know what you're fucking doing."

56:36.240 --> 56:38.640
This is a tweet I got after one of those.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.720
And... it was all in capitals,

56:41.800 --> 56:42.920
which excited me...

56:44.720 --> 56:46.800
That's the sign of Twitter madness.

56:46.880 --> 56:49.280
Mixed with anger. It's great, right?

56:49.360 --> 56:50.680
I looked at his profile.

56:50.760 --> 56:52.920
Sure enough, he's a gentleman from Texas.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.200
He's a fundamentalist, 
creationist Christian.

56:56.280 --> 56:57.200
Which is fine!

56:57.280 --> 56:59.640
He loves God. He loves God and...

56:59.720 --> 57:01.440
fetuses, mainly.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.280
He loves the fetus from conception

57:04.360 --> 57:06.840
to when it turns out gay, and then he's...

57:16.680 --> 57:19.240
Remember it's in capitals. 
He's shouting at me.

57:20.040 --> 57:21.160
Best tweet ever.

57:22.160 --> 57:23.480
"YOUR SCIENCE--"

57:23.560 --> 57:25.200
My science, right?

57:25.280 --> 57:29.800
Science, by the way, is spelled
S-C-I-E-N-T-S.

57:30.840 --> 57:32.720
Already good, isn't it? I mean...

57:33.440 --> 57:36.480
He's obviously heard the word,
he took a guess...

57:38.320 --> 57:42.640
Never seen it written down,
because it's not in the Bible. So he's...

57:46.760 --> 57:48.320
"YOUR SCIENTS WON'T HELP YOU...

57:48.400 --> 57:49.720
Well, it will.

57:51.240 --> 57:52.520
It's helping him...

57:52.600 --> 57:55.680
beam this little message 
up to a satellite and down to me.

58:00.200 --> 58:02.960
"YOUR SCIENTS WON'T HELP YOU
WHEN SATAN..."

58:03.440 --> 58:05.680
Of course he believes in Satan. Why not?

58:05.760 --> 58:08.760
He believes that God made the universe
in six days.

58:08.840 --> 58:11.600
You're not gonna say to him,
"Do you believe in Satan?"

58:11.680 --> 58:13.520
And have him say, "Bit far-fetched."

58:18.280 --> 58:20.360
Why doesn't God kill Satan?

58:21.920 --> 58:23.800
That's... what I'd ask him.

58:23.880 --> 58:25.360
If I was wrong and I met God,

58:25.440 --> 58:27.000
I'd go, "Oh, you do exist."

58:27.080 --> 58:28.000
He'd go, "Yeah."

58:28.080 --> 58:30.560
I'd go, "I've got 
a few fucking questions, mate.

58:33.120 --> 58:34.520
The first one would be,

58:34.600 --> 58:36.960
"Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?"

58:41.160 --> 58:42.600
Mental, right?

58:45.040 --> 58:48.560
Also, if you hate homosexuality so much,

58:48.640 --> 58:51.760
why did you put the male G-spot
up the arse?

58:51.840 --> 58:52.680
What...

58:56.000 --> 58:57.960
What is wrong with you?

58:59.240 --> 59:00.080
Then I'd say,

59:00.160 --> 59:02.240
"Why don't you kill Satan?"

59:02.320 --> 59:03.760
And he'd go, "What?"

59:03.840 --> 59:06.400
I'd go, "Why don't you kill Satan?

59:06.480 --> 59:07.960
If he does all the bad stuff

59:08.040 --> 59:10.920
and you do all the good stuff, 
which you want...

59:11.000 --> 59:12.320
I mean, you do want--"

59:12.400 --> 59:13.280
"Yes, yeah."

59:13.360 --> 59:16.800
"You could kill him if you wanted,
you can do anything, easy."

59:16.880 --> 59:17.720
"Yeah."

59:17.800 --> 59:19.640
"Why don't you kill him, then?"

59:20.200 --> 59:21.120
"Because...

59:22.040 --> 59:23.000
Shut up."

59:29.320 --> 59:31.040
"YOUR SCIENTS WON'T HELP YOU

59:31.120 --> 59:34.600
WHEN SATAN IS RAPING
YOUR BRITISH ASS."

59:43.640 --> 59:45.200
And he's got a point.

59:47.800 --> 59:49.480
Because if I die,

59:49.560 --> 59:51.520
and I find myself in Hell,

59:51.600 --> 59:53.400
being raped by Satan...

59:54.040 --> 59:56.520
Science has pretty much let me down.

1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:05.240
But it's this last line 
that he just throws away.

1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:06.760
The line he signs off with,

1:00:06.840 --> 1:00:09.160
makes this the best tweet 
I've ever received.

1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:13.600
"YOUR SCIENTS WON'T HELP YOU WHEN
SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.

1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:14.880
I'LL BE LAUGHING."

1:00:15.360 --> 1:00:18.640
So... he's there too! He's...

1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:26.120
So, he's a fundamentalist... Christian,

1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:28.840
who's lived his life 
by the Old and New Testaments.

1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:31.520
He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right?

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:34.080
Which must be off the charts

1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:37.680
on the scale of emotional trauma...

1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:39.160
"Oh, my God, I'm in Hell!

1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:41.360
Oh, my God,
why have you forsaken me?

1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:44.240
I'm gonna be tortured for eternity!"

1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:47.000
He sees me getting raped
and goes, "Ha, ha, ha!"

1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:52.160
He's suddenly over it, is he?

1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:55.320
His day's suddenly got 
a little bit brighter.

1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:59.040
And like he's not next, right?

1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:03.360
So I'm getting raped,
right, by the Devil, right?

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:07.200
He's just there. 
"You fucking atheist scum."

1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:09.560
And I'm like that. "Yeah, whatever."

1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:12.920
I assume it happens all eternity.
"Yeah, yeah, whatever."

1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:14.400
Like that.

1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:17.120
I might say, "Watch your hooves
on my testicles."

1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:23.560
And he'd go, "Why are they so distended?"

1:01:23.640 --> 1:01:26.640
And I go, "Oh, like you're Brad Pitt!"

1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:28.160
You know what I mean?

1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:30.280
Sorry, are we talking or raping?

1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:31.200
Can we...

1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:38.600
"You lying, fucking atheist."
He's probably bored.

1:01:38.680 --> 1:01:41.760
"Fucking atheists. Every fucking day."
Right?

1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:44.360
His little gargoyle comes up. "Satan?"

1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:46.400
He goes, "What?" And I go, "Yeah? What?"

1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:49.440
He goes, 
"There's a fundamentalist Christian."

1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:52.360
"Fuck this!" 
He'd be on him like a ton of bricks!

1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:56.680
So... I got that tweet.

1:01:56.760 --> 1:01:59.800
I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right?

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:05.960
And just watch the fun, people piling on,
going, "Ah, loser!"

1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:08.480
And he's fighting back, really witlessly,

1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:11.800
saying things like, "Go fuck your sister,
you English faggot!"

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:18.680
That makes no sense at all.

1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:23.600
I forgot about it. 
Went and did something else.

1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:25.760
Few hours later, on Twitter again.

1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:27.800
It's still all going off, right?

1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:31.000
It's really funny, 
I'm laughing at all the replies.

1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:34.080
People saying things to him. 
I'm scrolling down.

1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:37.760
There's one tweet, directly to me,
from this woman. She says,

1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:39.480
"You find rape funny?"

1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:41.280
No! No! What?

1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:42.200
No...

1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:44.000
"Your mates find rape funny?"

1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:45.000
No! Listen, right?

1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:46.400
"You find rape funny?"

1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:48.840
Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No...

1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:51.600
I said to her,
"I didn't tweet that."

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.800
-She went, "You retweeted it."
-To show he's an idiot.

1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:57.600
"But you must find it funny or amusing.

1:02:57.680 --> 1:02:59.360
It's not a frivolous thing."

1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:03.880
I said, "No, well, it's up to him, 
isn't it? He can do it."

1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:06.720
Now I'm arguing
with quite a nice, sane person,

1:03:06.800 --> 1:03:08.360
who thinks this is mental.

1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:10.640
But I'm fighting for his right...

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:16.360
to fantasize about me being
raped by the Devil.

1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:20.240
Because I'm so conscious 
of "freedom of speech"...

1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:22.880
What a topsy-turvy world, right?

1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:26.240
Although her opening gambit 
annoyed me a bit.

1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:28.680
Because she did that thing that people do.

1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:32.120
She didn't say, "What, you find jokes
about rape funny?"

1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:34.440
She said, "What, you find rape funny?"

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.840
The answer to that is, no, of course not.
No one finds rape funny.

1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:42.240
Not even rapists find rape funny,
know what I mean?

1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:46.320
Noone ever gives evidence saying,
"It was dark, he wore a ski mask,

1:03:46.400 --> 1:03:47.520
and he was giggling."

1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:48.560
That's never...

1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:56.520
So... I sent back,

1:03:56.920 --> 1:03:59.560
"You mean jokes about rape?"
She said, "Yes."

1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:03.240
-I went, "Depends on the joke."
"-It fucking doesn't!"

1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:06.280
I'm going, "No, it does! It does! 
It depends on the joke.

1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:09.480
It's about context, it's about content.

1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:11.640
What do you mean by a rape joke?"

1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:15.200
She said, "Even a joke with 
the word 'rape' in it is unacceptable."

1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:18.720
I said, "That's ridiculous,
it depends what the joke is."

1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:21.840
I tweeted that clip of me 
in The Office, going,

1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:24.840
"I think there's been a rape up there!"

1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:32.520
Everyone gets that because of the context.

1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:34.720
And the target is a middle-aged man,

1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:38.400
who's so narcissistic, 
he'll say anything to win a silly game.

1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:41.880
You have to understand the joke
and where it comes from.

1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:44.360
I said, "Some jokes don't
punch up or down.

1:04:44.440 --> 1:04:45.880
They don't punch anywhere.

1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:49.920
They can just be a pun, a play on words,
that don't really mean anything."

1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:53.840
A joke went round when I was a kid,
even adults told it.

1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:55.040
I'll tell you.

1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:57.760
A woman goes running 
into a police station.

1:04:57.840 --> 1:04:59.720
She says, "Help, I've been graped!"

1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:02.160
The policeman says, "Do you mean raped?"

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:04.040
She says, "No, there was a bunch of them."

1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:13.840
That is a rape joke, right?

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:15.400
So....

1:05:15.480 --> 1:05:18.960
And I even said to her, 
"No, I agree, in most cases, yeah.

1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:23.400
Real rape jokes, they are fucking horrible
when the victim is the target.

1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:25.480
Disgusting! I'd never tell those.

1:05:25.560 --> 1:05:29.160
But it depends on the joke,
not the word or the subject."

1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:32.800
I calmed it down, and they agreed
some jokes are worse than others.

1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:34.840
She ended it by saying,

1:05:34.920 --> 1:05:38.600
"Well, okay, I see your point, 
but... still...

1:05:38.680 --> 1:05:42.240
I will laugh at a joke 
with the word 'rape' in it,

1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:44.760
when no-one in the audience
has been raped."

1:05:45.760 --> 1:05:47.480
I should have left it.

1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:51.920
I just sent back,

1:05:59.680 --> 1:06:01.120
"What a weird door policy."

1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:05.160
You turn up to a comedy gig, 
pay your money,

1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:07.760
someone says, "Can I just
ask you a question?"

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:08.680
Yeah.

1:06:09.400 --> 1:06:10.760
Have you ever been raped?

1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:11.800
I have, yes.

1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:13.080
You can't come in.

1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:15.280
What? Why?

1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:17.640
A lady says she won't laugh
if you're in.

1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:18.560
Off you go.

1:06:20.320 --> 1:06:23.920
That's what the world is like.
People take everything personally.

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.600
They think the world revolves around them,
particularly on Twitter.

1:06:27.680 --> 1:06:30.080
I'm not tweeting anyone,
I'm just tweeting.

1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:34.160
I don't know who's following me.
I've got 12 million followers.

1:06:34.240 --> 1:06:36.440
They can be following me
without me knowing,

1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:40.560
choose to read my tweet,
and then take that personally.

1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:42.760
That's like going into a town square,

1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:44.680
seeing a big noticeboard saying

1:06:44.760 --> 1:06:46.680
"Guitar lessons", and you go,

1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:49.520
"But I don't fucking want guitar lessons!"

1:06:59.600 --> 1:07:00.520
What's this?

1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:04.200
There's a number here. Right, call that.

1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:07.080
Are you giving guitar lessons?

1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:08.720
I don't fucking want any!

1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:13.720
Fine! It's not for you, then. 
Just walk away.

1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:15.640
Don't worry about it.

1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:20.120
I should say one thing 
in Twitter's defense.

1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:24.440
I use it as a marketing tool and for fun,
like everyone else.

1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:28.360
But one great thing about Twitter,
for me, personally,

1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:30.640
I'm very into anti-animal cruelty.

1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:35.920
Years ago, it would take ages
to get 100,000 signatures on a petition.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.080
Standing outside Tesco's or something.

1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:41.960
That's the magic number,
because then it gets heard in Parliament.

1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:45.440
I've been part of many campaigns 
through Twitter

1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:49.440
when we've got 100,000 signatures in days,
and the law has been changed.

1:07:49.880 --> 1:07:52.760
Thank you to those who've retweeted
about animal cruelty.

1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:54.000
It makes a difference.

1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:55.280
Thank you.

1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:05.200
But even something as clear and distinct
as animal cruelty,

1:08:05.280 --> 1:08:07.360
You think no one's gonna argue with that.

1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:10.240
Yes, they will.

1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:12.120
They just wanna be heard.

1:08:12.200 --> 1:08:15.040
I'll tweet something about 
a bull being tortured

1:08:15.120 --> 1:08:17.040
in a bullring for entertainment.

1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:18.560
I say, "Ban bullfighting."

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:21.520
Someone always says,
"What about the kids in Syria?"

1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:22.520
What?

1:08:25.480 --> 1:08:27.480
Well, I'm not giving you a choice.

1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:32.080
You can do both. I'm not saying,

1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:34.920
"Throw that kid back in the hole,
there's a bull here!"

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:41.240
And there's one thing that I didn't want
in my head,

1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:45.400
but it exists, so we have to deal with it
now that I found out, through Twitter.

1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:48.280
There's a thing called 
the Yulin Dog Meat Festival,

1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:49.640
in China, every year.

1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:50.800
And it's horrendous.

1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:54.360
And we send people with money
to buy the dogs,

1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:56.200
to bring them back.

1:08:56.320 --> 1:08:59.320
It's a drop in the ocean.
They eat thousands over this weekend.

1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:02.320
I tweet the details,

1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:04.920
the petition, people don't really read it.

1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.880
It's a knee-jerk. People say, "Racist!"

1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:08.840
I go, "What?"

1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:11.760
They go, 
"We eat pigs and cows in the West."

1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:14.280
Yep, we do. I don't but, yeah, I used to.

1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:16.560
You're right, a pig or a cow

1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:18.320
is worth as much as a dog.

1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:21.560
It's not about the species.
It's what they do to these poor dogs.

1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:24.760
What they do is torture the dogs first.

1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:26.920
'Cause they think 
it makes the meat taste better.

1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:29.640
They beat them, they blowtorch them.

1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:31.400
They even skin them alive.

1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:33.120
And I saw this picture...

1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:35.760
on Twitter
of the opening of this ceremony.

1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:40.040
These two guys, in this Chinese square,
and they're skinning this dog alive.

1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:43.640
It's screaming, they're laughing.
It's the worst thing I've ever seen.

1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:46.120
I thought, "I've got to tweet that."

1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:49.560
I tweeted the picture, with a petition,
and I just said,

1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:53.800
"One beautiful creature,
and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive."

1:09:53.880 --> 1:09:55.480
Right? And it took off.

1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:57.400
Loads of retweets, it made the press.

1:09:57.840 --> 1:10:00.840
I got one tweet back,
from a woman, that said,

1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:02.480
"Is that language necessary?"

1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:11.040
I should have left it, right?

1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:15.120
But I was... I was incensed! I said,

1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:18.400
"You're more offended by a word

1:10:18.480 --> 1:10:20.840
than by an animal being 
tortured to death?"

1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:23.520
She said, "I just hate the C-word."

1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:26.280
I definitely should have left it.

1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:31.400
I sent back, "People who hate the C-word
would hear it a lot less,

1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:33.880
if they didn't go round
acting like such cunts."

1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:35.160
Thank you!

1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:37.440
You've been fantastic! Good night!

1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:01.600
Cheers! Thank you so much!

1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:05.600
Thank you so much.

1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:07.760
I hope you enjoyed the show.

1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:09.440
I hope no-one was offended.

1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:12.000
No, I really do! That's not the point.

1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:13.840
I've always wanted people to know

1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:15.600
they can laugh at bad things,

1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:16.920
without being bad people.

1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:18.600
I think it's my upbringing.

1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:21.440
I grew up... in poverty, with nothing.

1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:24.000
But the point was to pay your way

1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:25.240
then have a laugh.

1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:27.760
That was the men. 
The women carried on working.

1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:33.440
It was my older brother, Bob,

1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:37.040
it was him who I first saw
making these dark jokes,

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:40.280
right in the bad situation,
as things were happening.

1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:44.200
People were laughing.
I realized, "He's healing them."

1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:46.720
That's what comedy's for, 
what humor's for.

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:48.280
It gets us over bad stuff.

1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:50.720
Right? Typical Bob story.

1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:54.360
He once spent an hour in the pound shop

1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:57.080
in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier

1:11:57.160 --> 1:11:58.640
how much everything was.

1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:04.320
Just to see if he could break
this poor man's will.

1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:10.040
Bob was the first person I saw
answer back to authority.

1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:12.840
The first authority you come across are 
your parents.

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:15.600
And he'd get in trouble.
He got sent to bed.

1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:17.680
But I thought he'd won the argument.

1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:19.520
And he'd tease my mum.

1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:22.320
My mum was a typical working-class woman.

1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:25.480
As I say,
we lived in a shitty area, right?

1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:28.160
And most of the houses looked like

1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:32.080
a bit of mud, and a stolen bike,
and fence posts missing.

1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:36.280
She mended the fence, turfed the garden
herself, painted the step.

1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:39.760
She thought, "If it looked respectable,
we'd be respectable."

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:41.720
It was about reputation, I guess.

1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:44.760
Bob would send her postcards
that just read,

1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:47.760
"Is that pedophile postman
still reading your mail?"

1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:51.160
And she'd take it, she'd go in,

1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:53.640
and she'd be horrified. She'd call Bob.

1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:56.280
"He saw it this time,
you must stop doing that!"

1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:07.280
Even at her funeral... My mum died first,

1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:09.680
and my dad carried on for a year or so,

1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:11.880
just drinking beer, then he went.

1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:15.040
At Mum's funeral, we had different duties.

1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:16.760
I did catering and flowers.

1:13:16.840 --> 1:13:18.920
Bob went to see the local vicar.

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.040
That was a mistake, right?

1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:25.520
We'd never been to church,
he didn't know us, we didn't know him.

1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:26.960
So, he said to Bob,

1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:29.720
"Tell me about your mum,
so I can say a few words."

1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:32.080
Bob saw that as an opportunity, right?

1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:35.240
So, Bob, with a straight face, said,

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:37.520
"Well, she was a keen racist."

1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:43.120
The vicar went, "I can't say that."

1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:45.320
Bob said, "Okay, put she liked gardening."

1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:50.800
He was trying to get the vicar to say
something to make us laugh in church.

1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:52.400
He didn't warn us.

1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:54.720
And he did get something by the vicar.

1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:57.560
So we're called Ricky, Robert-- Bob--

1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:00.160
Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry.

1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:02.840
Now, Larry is the oldest, 
in his seventies.

1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:04.120
Born in the war.

1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:06.840
I always thought he was the sensible one.

1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:09.880
First born, weight of the world
on his shoulders.

1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:11.880
My mum said, when he was a teenager,

1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:14.920
he got a job and gave her 
the money to help out.

1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000
He's a stand-up guy, Larry.

1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:20.080
So, Bob... gives the vicar the wrong name.

1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:24.840
Didn't warn us. We're all in church.

1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:27.760
Start of the funeral, we're all there.

1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:28.760
Packed out.

1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:30.760
The coffin comes down.

1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:32.600
Guided by the vicar.

1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:34.840
The vicar goes to his pulpit.

1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:37.520
All confident,
with his little notes, right?

1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:39.840
And he goes...

1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:44.440
Eva leaves behind four loving children.

1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:45.840
Ricky.

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:47.040
Robert.

1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:48.000
Marsha.

1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:49.240
And Barry.

1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:53.840
And... we snort like that, right?

1:14:54.520 --> 1:14:55.360
Bob's going...

1:14:56.880 --> 1:14:58.960
Everyone realizes. We're all laughing.

1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:00.400
We see Larry go...

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:03.880
All right.

1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:07.120
And the church is like...

1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:10.640
Every time we thought of it,

1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:13.040
we'd see Larry go...

1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:14.320
Like that, right?

1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:19.080
Then we'd just start giggling,
just fits of fucking giggles, right?

1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:21.760
Larry eventually started doing this.

1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:26.520
And the vicar's thinking, 
"What have I said?" Right?

1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:30.000
He'd put in a few things the vicar 
didn't know

1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:31.760
that set us off again.

1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:34.760
Things that were just lies, 
or slightly wrong.

1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:37.800
My nieces and nephews started crying.

1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:40.480
I'd come prepared with a pack of tissues.

1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:43.760
They'd take one and hand it on.
Before the funeral,

1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:45.960
I'd taken the tissues out,

1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:48.920
written on them, folded them back
and put them in.

1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.720
And each tissue said,
"Snivelling fucking bitch."

1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:55.160
And they're sort of laughing.

1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:57.680
So it was like a madhouse, right?

1:15:57.760 --> 1:15:59.680
Everything the vicar said or did,

1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:02.120
we all started fucking laughing! Right?

1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:07.160
And you could see the vicar was
visibly shook a little bit.

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.280
He ended the funeral,
and he made a beeline for me and Bob.

1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:13.520
He said, "Sorry, was that okay?"

1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:16.160
Me and Bob went, "Fucking brilliant, mate.

1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:17.800
It was fucking brilliant."

1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:21.640
That's what I mean. We're all gonna die,
so we should have a laugh.

1:16:21.720 --> 1:16:25.600
If you can laugh in the face of adversity,
you're bullet-proof.

1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:29.040
Me and my brother, Bob,
had one simple rule, and that was

1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:31.840
if you think of something funny,
you've got to say it.

1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:34.600
Win, lose or draw.

1:16:38.400 --> 1:16:39.720
It might go well...

1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:49.040
it might go badly.

1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:50.800
But you've gotta say it.

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:53.720
And bear that in mind,
as I leave you with this.

1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:54.640
Right...

1:16:57.480 --> 1:16:59.800
So... we're all in the car one day.

1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:02.320
Bob's driving. Packed in this car.

1:17:02.400 --> 1:17:04.240
A little day trip to the beach.

1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:06.520
We get stopped for a security check.

1:17:07.400 --> 1:17:09.240
And there's a British bobby there.

1:17:09.320 --> 1:17:10.560
And he stops the car.

1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:13.040
Bob's at the window.
He said, "Where are we off to?"

1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:14.160
Bob went, "Bognor."

1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:17.360
He went, "Can you just pop the boot, 
please?"

1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:18.840
So he looks at that.

1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:20.680
Looks in the boot, like that.

1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:22.360
Back to Bob's window.

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:25.720
Gets that mirror on a stick thing.

1:17:25.800 --> 1:17:28.320
And he starts just looking under the car.

1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:31.680
And as he does that,
his helmet falls off, right?

1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:34.520
And out of the helmet falls a packet
of 20 cigarettes.

1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:36.120
And the copper went,

1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:39.120
"Bet you always wondered what we kept
under our helmets."

1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:42.320
And Bob went, 
"I knew it wasn't fucking brains."

1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:47.280
You've been amazing. Good night!
