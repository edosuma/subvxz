24:18.057 --> 24:18.724
SINCE THE FIRST TIME I HEARD OF

QUEEN.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.995
WHAT I LEARNED FROM FREDDIE

24:22.995 --> 24:24.163
ABOUT PERFORMING IS THE ABILITY

24:24.163 --> 24:26.098
TO CONNECT WITH THE CROWD.

24:26.098 --> 24:26.665
YOU CAN FEEL WHAT THEY WANT.

55:15.312 --> 55:16.180
OH, MY GOD.

55:16.180 --> 55:16.713
WHAT'S OUR SONG?

55:16.713 --> 55:20.884

55:20.884 --> 55:21.618
>> YEAH!

55:21.618 --> 55:22.853

55:28.192 --> 55:29.993
IT REMINDS ME OF WORKING ON "THE

55:30.928 --> 55:32.062

55:34.064 --> 55:35.098
"BOLD TYPE" IS ABOUT A MAGAZINE

55:35.098 --> 55:36.700
CALLED "SCARLET MAGAZINE."

55:36.700 --> 55:39.303
I PLAYED JACQUELINE CARLISLE.

55:39.303 --> 55:41.471
AND SHE'S REALLY AN AMAZING

55:41.471 --> 55:43.941
