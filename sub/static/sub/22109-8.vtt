WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:05.606
(sleigh bells jingling)

00:08.709 --> 00:10.678
D'oh!

00:10.711 --> 00:12.213
(grunts)

00:15.783 --> 00:17.017
(camera shutter clicks)

00:21.289 --> 00:23.524
-Here's your raise.
-D'oh!

00:23.557 --> 00:25.559
*

00:32.966 --> 00:35.869
Light! Light! Light...!

00:35.903 --> 00:36.904
-LISA: Light!
-(Marge groans)

00:36.937 --> 00:38.706
-It's your turn to get up.
-Light.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.175
Oh. I'll never understand
how something

00:41.209 --> 00:44.778
that came from inside of you
became my responsibility.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.046
(both grunting)

00:46.080 --> 00:48.616
-(grunts) Mm.
-Out!

00:48.649 --> 00:50.284
Light!

00:50.318 --> 00:52.620
Daddy. Breakfast.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.688
Geez, this kid's kind of smart.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.090
Tuesday.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.225
Au-Autumn.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.260
-(gasp) She's a genius.
-Foliage.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.929
Like the guy who invented
shoes with lights in them.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.731
LISA:
Cornucopia?

01:03.764 --> 01:04.965
(chuckles)

01:04.998 --> 01:08.269
Aw, sweetie, it's no surprise
you're awesome.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.539
We didn't have to pull you out
by the elbow, like the boy.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.040
Mwah.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.309
(humming)

01:15.343 --> 01:16.377
D'oh!

01:16.410 --> 01:17.411
(resumes humming)

01:17.445 --> 01:19.513
(keys clacking, bell dinging)

01:21.815 --> 01:23.951
Harvard College,
admissions essay.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.886
Lisa M. Simpson.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.322
I was born with one
great advantage in life...

01:28.356 --> 01:30.958
A voice that would make a rhino
stick its horn up its butt?

01:30.991 --> 01:33.161
Rhinos are extinct, nimrod.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.963
Not hippos. I just saw one
in smelly, blue pants.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.097
Why you little...

01:37.131 --> 01:39.967
I'm not little.
I'm 20, and I live at home.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.069
-(choking) Oh, man.
-Why you disappointing...

01:42.102 --> 01:44.305
You know you're choking
someone who can vote.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.174
-But did you vote?
-No.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.142
-Why you little...
-Oh, come on, man.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.511
...not voting
fascist-enabling...

01:50.544 --> 01:51.845
(Bart gagging)

01:51.879 --> 01:55.149
HOMER: Must stop
President Kid Rock.

01:55.183 --> 01:58.085
I was born with
one great advantage,

01:58.118 --> 02:01.155
a family that never made
anything easy.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.757
Never more than
on my seventh birthday.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.893
-(grunting)
-(choking)

02:07.661 --> 02:09.363
(gasps) It's my birthday!

02:09.397 --> 02:10.798
Seven years old!

02:10.831 --> 02:14.001
I'll wear
my favorite blue dress.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.170
I'll wear red, just for today.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.671
It's my birthday.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.773
I want bacon!

02:19.807 --> 02:21.008
(noisy munching sounds)

02:21.041 --> 02:22.976
-Shh!
-(slurping)

02:23.010 --> 02:24.978
I can't get Maggie to sleep.

02:25.012 --> 02:28.449
I guess I'll just have
to start using these.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.950
(frantic sucking)

02:29.983 --> 02:33.454
Whoa, okay, okay.
That's enough for now.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.724
(grunts) Geez, come on.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.059
(grumbling)

02:39.092 --> 02:41.595
Don't make me put you
under warm water.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.365
I give up.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.367
(groans)

02:46.400 --> 02:48.369
(camera shutter clicks)

02:48.402 --> 02:50.204
Anyone have anything
to say to me?

02:50.238 --> 02:53.040
-Well, of course, honey.
-(giggles)

02:53.073 --> 02:54.575
Get ready for school
or you'll be late.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.843
(Lisa groans)

02:55.876 --> 02:57.978
Oy, this baby.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.148
Lisa, sweetie, I know
why you're excited.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.183
This is a very big day.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.685
-Happy...
-(gasps)

03:04.718 --> 03:07.355
...hour at Moe's
was extended by an hour.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.089
-Wh-What?
-Mwah.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.492
* Happy hour at Moe's

03:11.525 --> 03:13.227
* Now he'll never close.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.263
(vacuum whirring)

03:18.031 --> 03:20.334
-(vacuum turns off)
-(Marge sighs)

03:20.368 --> 03:22.102
(moans sadly)

03:22.135 --> 03:23.103
(school bell ringing)

03:23.136 --> 03:27.040
Class, today is
a very special day.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.009
It's someone's birthday.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.579
Someone whose parents
pretended to forget.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.846
Yes.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.016
And that someone is...
Hubert Wong.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.018
Happy birthday, superstar.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.720
(Lisa sobs)

03:39.753 --> 03:43.424
Lisa, please don't ruin
Hubert's birthday.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.759
You wouldn't like it
if someone ruined yours.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.561
(gasping cries)

03:47.595 --> 03:51.432
I am sorry, but if you
can't control yourself,

03:51.465 --> 03:53.267
I'll have to send you
to the office.

03:53.301 --> 03:58.038
But you saying that makes me
wants to cry more.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.073
(crying)

04:03.076 --> 04:05.313
(moans)

04:05.346 --> 04:06.780
Mmm!

04:06.814 --> 04:09.850
No, Hubert.
No cupcake for her.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.591
Lisa, school is a place
for sitting quietly.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.992
What about learning?

04:19.026 --> 04:21.128
No longer part of our mandate.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.297
Did your mom ever
disappoint you?

04:23.331 --> 04:25.098
This isn't about mother,

04:25.132 --> 04:27.000
so don't say
a mother word about her.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.236
Don't you dare, Mother,
don't you dare.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.305
Ah. It's just me, a student.

04:31.339 --> 04:34.775
-I can't hear you, Mother.
-(whimpers)

04:37.311 --> 04:39.947
She's everywhere and everyone.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.351
I'm everywhere
because you're nothing.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.954
Thanks for getting me
out of work, sweetie.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.189
-Want the rest of my donut?
-No, sir.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.791
(stammers) What?

04:50.824 --> 04:52.793
Aw, please tell me what's wrong.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.796
I can't tell you.
You just have to know.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.165
-Would tickling help matters?
-No.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.200
Well, that's really
all I have in my toolbox.

05:00.233 --> 05:03.136
Okay, let me think.
What's today? Tuesday?

05:03.170 --> 05:04.204
Yes.

05:04.237 --> 05:09.309
That would make you six years
and 365 days old.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.310
Yes.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.179
It's your birthday!

05:12.212 --> 05:14.448
And you forgot it, Lisa.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.050
But because it's your birthday,
I forgive you.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.353
And you're gonna have
the best day ever.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.021
Optimism, you're back.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.959
-(horn honks)
-Attention, world.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.897
It's little Lisa's birthday,
and you all forgot.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.632
-Not me.
-(groans)

05:31.665 --> 05:34.134
Now I suppose I got to get
your kid something.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.969
Just remember them
in your prayers.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.071
Both of them? Fine.

05:38.105 --> 05:43.711
ALL:
* Happy birthday, dear Lisa

05:43.744 --> 05:48.382
* Happy birthday to you

05:48.416 --> 05:51.084
* We all forgot.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.154
(flames sizzling)

05:54.187 --> 05:57.057
And all was well,
until the next year,

05:57.090 --> 05:58.592
when they forgot again.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.060
I mean, really, two in a row?

06:00.093 --> 06:02.262
Even Luigi remembers it.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.432
Well, we have-a
the same-a birthday.

06:04.465 --> 06:08.101
Makes it easy.
You, me, and Hubert Wong.

06:08.135 --> 06:11.872
That's a-right, Hubert.
Cupcake for her.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.446
As I got older,

06:18.479 --> 06:21.449
I realized, as all must,

06:21.482 --> 06:24.284
that my parents
were not demigods.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.521
(robotic voice):
You are going to die soon.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.722
Shut up.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.190
(robotic voice):
You are going to die soon.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.391
Shut up.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.060
(robotic voice):
Blood pressure spiking.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.462
Shut up!

06:34.495 --> 06:37.130
-Calling your doctor.
-(phone dialing, line ringing)

06:37.164 --> 06:38.899
DR. HIBBERT:
Hello? (laughing)

06:38.932 --> 06:40.267
Shut up!

06:40.300 --> 06:41.935
No, they are a man and a woman

06:41.969 --> 06:44.237
trapped in a fragile marriage

06:44.271 --> 06:47.741
that nearly fell apart
when I turned 14.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.479
Happy birthday! Happy birthday!

06:51.512 --> 06:53.881
I remembered!
Don't tell your therapist.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.950
* Lisa, it's your birthday

06:56.984 --> 07:00.387
* Here's five brand-new verses

07:00.420 --> 07:03.957
* Soon you'll be a woman

07:03.991 --> 07:06.760
* Soon you'll be in love

07:06.794 --> 07:10.097
* Who'd be better
to take advice from *

07:10.130 --> 07:13.000
* Than a man who wears
one glove? *

07:13.033 --> 07:14.001
(imitating Michael Jackson)
Hee-hee!

07:14.034 --> 07:17.437
* Lisa, it's your birthday

07:17.471 --> 07:21.008
* Happy birthday, Lisa

07:21.041 --> 07:24.144
* Lisa, it's your birthday

07:24.177 --> 07:27.615
* Happy birthday, Lisa.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.349
-Yeah.
-HOMER: Mm-hmm.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.985
Thank you.
It's a wonderful cake, Dad,

07:32.019 --> 07:33.253
but I'm 14.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.287
D'oh!

07:36.624 --> 07:37.825
Happy birthday, Lisa.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.027
We miss you in second grade.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.996
Oh, someday you'll
get out of there, Ralph.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.165
I don't want to.
I'm bigger than teacher.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.768
I broke my desk.
Teacher cry.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.038
I'm growing a mustache
under my long nose.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.243
(grunts)
Better use Mom's closet.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.348
Oof. It's full?

08:05.185 --> 08:07.955
Read me. Read me.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.189
Come on, help a letter out.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.692
(moans)

08:11.725 --> 08:13.026
"Dear Homer,

08:13.060 --> 08:14.962
By the time you read this..."

08:14.995 --> 08:16.129
MARGE: I will be gone.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.331
Since we married,
you've changed.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.067
Not once for the better.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.135
What's it say? I can't read.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.638
MARGE: So I'm taking
the kids and opening

08:24.672 --> 08:26.206
a bed-and-breakfast.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.241
(speaking German)

08:30.678 --> 08:32.212
MARGE:
Bitterly, Marge.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.213
(gasps)

08:33.246 --> 08:35.883
Is Mom really leaving Dad?

08:38.886 --> 08:41.154
(gasps)

08:41.188 --> 08:43.691
So, you finally left him.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.493
Well, good for me
and good for you.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.997
I finally learned how
to unhook a bra with one hand.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.265
MARGE:
Lisa, I know what you're doing.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.300
(gasps)

08:55.468 --> 08:57.337
You're hiding when you're
supposed to help me

08:57.370 --> 08:58.706
give the dog a bath.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.341
Mom, Mom!
(whimpers)

09:01.374 --> 09:04.277
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm not going anywhere.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.113
Oh, God bless you, inertia.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.749
-Not until I wash this dog.
-(burps)

09:09.817 --> 09:11.952
(whispers):
Bart, Mom's leaving Dad.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.220
Oh, the poor guy.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.756
Please let me tell him, please.

09:15.789 --> 09:16.957
BART:
Pass the gravy.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.293
We used to call it "grave,"
but that was too scary.

09:20.327 --> 09:23.731
So we modified it to "gravy,"
unless it had meat chunks.

09:23.764 --> 09:28.368
In which case, it was "gravier,"
but the war changed everything.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.370
Ugh.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.707
I wish you wouldn't drink
so much in front of the kids.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.376
Marge, I tried to drink
in the pantry,

09:36.409 --> 09:38.712
but you claim
that's antisocial.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.048
Ugh. Why don't you
just go to Moe's?

09:41.081 --> 09:44.952
You want me to go to a bar
on my daughter's birthday?

09:44.985 --> 09:47.154
That is so messed up.

09:47.187 --> 09:50.223
I'm going, of course,
but it is so messed up.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.391
Happy birthday.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.392
(door slams)

09:52.425 --> 09:53.393
(Marge groans)

09:53.426 --> 09:55.428
(crying quietly)

09:58.098 --> 10:00.968
Harvard will save me.
Harvard will save me.

10:03.036 --> 10:07.007
Kiss me, Lisa, in front of
the hall my grandfather endowed.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.578
He made his money in opium,
but we said it was molasses.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.180
(Marge crying)

10:13.213 --> 10:15.282
First, I have to save
my parents' marriage.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.017
Wait here in this fantasy?

10:17.050 --> 10:20.120
Yeah, can we, um, you know,
see other people?

10:20.153 --> 10:21.154
Sure.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.096
(Marge crying)

10:29.129 --> 10:32.032
(crying continues)

10:32.065 --> 10:33.600
(electrical crackling)

10:33.633 --> 10:35.135
(bell jingles)

10:38.205 --> 10:40.373
Man, Moe, you sure are spry.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.876
(stammers)
The job keeps me young, eh.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.350
Dad! Mom is gonna leave you.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.186
Sweetie, marriages
are like water heaters--

10:53.220 --> 10:54.955
they sit peacefully for years

10:54.988 --> 10:59.026
until they explode in a fireball
ruining everything you own.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.527
Mom packed her bags.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.196
Which suitcase?
The one with the broken wheel?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.799
Because she won't get more than
a block away with that.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.134
She fixed the wheel.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.335
Oh, God!

11:08.368 --> 11:10.037
(crying)

11:10.070 --> 11:12.672
-Dad, you've got to shape up.
-Hmm?

11:12.706 --> 11:14.241
I'm 14-years-old.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.077
These next four years
are the last memories I'll have

11:17.110 --> 11:18.879
of all of us together.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.380
I'll do anything
you say, sweetie.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.415
I want you to stop drinking.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.683
Stop drinking?

11:23.717 --> 11:26.586
But that's like asking a golfer
to stop drinking.

11:26.619 --> 11:27.487
(moans)

11:27.520 --> 11:28.922
I never thought I'd say this,

11:28.956 --> 11:30.991
but I'd better text my sponsor.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.392
Homer's got a sponsor?

11:32.425 --> 11:35.262
Uh, what idiot would lean
into that buzz saw?

11:35.295 --> 11:38.031
Hey, hey!
I'm the man from A-diddly-A!

11:38.065 --> 11:40.433
Ned, I have
to quit drinking. Now!

11:40.467 --> 11:43.370
All right, soberino,
it's just 12 simple steps.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.938
Oh, 12?

11:44.972 --> 11:46.039
Fine. Nine.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.607
Oh!

11:47.640 --> 11:49.943
Okay, step one:
Admit you're powerless.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.079
I'm powerless.
Boom! Done.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.615
Step two: Admit there is a power
greater than yourself.

11:55.648 --> 11:59.019
Um, if I'm powerless, isn't
every power greater than myself?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.288
This is the 12 steps,
not 20 questions.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.291
Now, make a decision
to turn your life to God.

12:04.324 --> 12:08.028
(scoffs) God. He's in every
deal, like undercoating. Fine.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.197
Make a searching
moral inventory of yourself.

12:10.230 --> 12:14.034
If I have one tiny flaw, it's
that I have many enormous flaws.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.535
Admit the nature of your wrongs.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.205
Well, I'm not
the best parallel parker.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.708
Are you ready for God
to remove these defects?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.643
Dear Lord, the Satan of Heaven,

12:23.676 --> 12:25.545
I order you to fix me.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.247
Okay, I'm just gonna
fast-forward through this.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.715
-Make amends.
-Here's your wallet.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.617
-Engage in prayer.
-I pray you're not mad.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.685
And have a spiritual awakening.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.556
(gasps)
Things that cost $9.99

12:36.589 --> 12:39.092
are really ten dollars!

12:39.126 --> 12:42.095
The Lord has spoken,
and it is good!

12:42.129 --> 12:43.997
That's it.
No more drinking.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.233
(clicking tongue)
Look at those, guys.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.301
I used to be like them.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.237
(laughs):
Oh, I'm overjoyed for thee.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.073
Call me anytime you hear
the devil's seductive voice.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.507
MOE:
Homer?

12:54.541 --> 12:55.943
(singsongy):
Homer...

12:55.976 --> 12:58.445
(deeper):
Homer...

12:58.478 --> 13:02.082
(deep, distorted):
How's about a Flaming Moe?

13:02.115 --> 13:03.616
(chuckles evilly)

13:03.650 --> 13:05.352
Drink me!

13:05.385 --> 13:09.122
I'm the most overpriced thing
at Universal Studios!

13:09.156 --> 13:11.158
No! I won't do it!

13:15.162 --> 13:18.866
Lisa, sweetie,
let's celebrate your birthday!

13:18.899 --> 13:20.033
Yes!

13:20.067 --> 13:21.801
HOMER:
Ah, honey.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.036
-(moaning)
-I'm so sorry.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.637
I miss you so much.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.608
LISA:
He did quit, for good,

13:28.641 --> 13:32.312
and it was the best
birthday present I ever got.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.882
Well, the essay is pretty trite.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.717
But her grades are perfect,
her extracurricular's stellar,

13:37.750 --> 13:40.353
and she'll be the first
from her state, ever.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.689
Admit! And now
for our instantaneous letter

13:42.722 --> 13:44.291
of acceptance.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.127
(whirring)

13:47.160 --> 13:48.161
(fanfare plays)

13:48.195 --> 13:51.598
(gasps)
I'm in! And I accept!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.268
(gasps, groans)

14:07.948 --> 14:12.319
I'm here! And it's Ivy-er
than my Ivy-est dreams.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.587
-Lisa Simpson.
-Lisa Simpson?

14:14.621 --> 14:17.757
Hmm, I'm sorry,
but there must be some mistake.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.927
-Oh, no!
-Ha! Gotcha!

14:19.960 --> 14:21.929
My one moment of superiority

14:21.962 --> 14:24.597
before a lifetime
of begging you for money.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.099
(tires squeal)

14:28.701 --> 14:30.037
(tires screech)

14:31.138 --> 14:34.007
Come on, sweetie, let me
carry you over the threshold.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.410
(laughs)
Dad! That's for weddings.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.179
I think Dad's
turning into Grampa.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.413
Hey, I don't need

14:40.447 --> 14:42.182
(like Grampa):
to listen to that hooey!

14:42.215 --> 14:44.784
Because I make tie clips
out of maple syrup,

14:44.817 --> 14:47.554
but only for Flag Day!

14:47.587 --> 14:49.389
* By the sea, by the sea

14:49.422 --> 14:51.358
* By the beautiful sea...

14:51.391 --> 14:54.427
This is great-- we don't have
to visit Grampa anymore.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.763
(whirring, beeping)

15:02.502 --> 15:04.938
(robotic voice):
Chug, chug, chug.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.307
(slurring):
Really, man, I've had enough.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.810
(robotic voice): The hazing
ends when we say it ends.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.946
Do you need any help unpacking?

15:12.980 --> 15:16.316
Mom, I need to learn
to do these things for myself.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.352
(whirring, clicking)

15:22.489 --> 15:23.890
Sorry, friend,

15:23.923 --> 15:26.159
you can't pahk your cah
in Hahvahd Yahd.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.097
I can't what my what
in what what what?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.631
You can't pahk...

15:31.664 --> 15:33.733
-Yes...?
-in Hahvahd Yahd.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.469
-Are you on Novocain?
-Yes, but recreationally.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.638
Now, move your craptastic cah.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.640
(Homer and Marge grumble)

15:40.673 --> 15:42.242
-(door opens)
-Hi. I'm Caitlyn.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.144
(gasps) My roommate.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.113
So, you play an instrument?

15:46.146 --> 15:47.747
Bari sax.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.517
-Are you good?
-I played at Kenny G's funeral.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.685
Ooh, she's pretty impressive.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.788
Uh... any childhood heartbreak?

15:55.822 --> 15:58.191
My parents forgot my birthday
three times.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.959
She beats me at everything!

15:59.993 --> 16:01.661
I don't belong here.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.164
While you were feeling inferior,
I took the top bunk.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.266
(exasperated grunt)

16:06.299 --> 16:08.868
ROBOT:
Stroke, stroke,

16:08.901 --> 16:10.037
stroke...

16:10.070 --> 16:12.172
(sighs sadly)
I'm not even gonna make it

16:12.205 --> 16:13.673
through freshman week.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.708
-Hey, little sister.
-Well!

16:15.742 --> 16:18.045
At least you're having
a good time.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.013
Yeah, these girls want me
to piss off their parents

16:20.047 --> 16:21.614
before they head home.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.550
(moaning)

16:23.583 --> 16:25.218
Get away from him, Mandy!

16:25.252 --> 16:26.719
I'll pay! I'll pay!

16:26.753 --> 16:28.455
Tell him I have two kids.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.091
The beauty part is,
it's not a lie.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.994
You always know
what to say, Bart.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.230
Well, try this.
I've known you all your life,

16:37.264 --> 16:40.533
and if there's one thing I know,
it's that you belong here.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.968
You're gonna study harder,

16:42.001 --> 16:43.703
you're gonna ask
better questions,

16:43.736 --> 16:46.005
you're gonna get into
their brains like an earworm

16:46.039 --> 16:48.175
and chew, chew, chew!

16:48.208 --> 16:49.076
(disgusted groan)

16:49.109 --> 16:50.543
Now, make Mom and Dad proud.

16:50.577 --> 16:51.978
And then I'll make 'em proud.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.880
-But you first.
-Thank you.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.656
This is it.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.426
I'm on my own
for the rest of my life.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.027
(sobbing nearby)

17:08.061 --> 17:10.197
Huh? Are you my roommate, too?

17:10.230 --> 17:13.866
For now.
Till they kick me out.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.169
Everyone thinks
they're not gonna make it.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.171
I already got kicked out
of a psycho single

17:18.205 --> 17:21.174
'cause my roommate
didn't like me.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.277
(deeply):
She used all the "shampoo"!

17:24.311 --> 17:26.246
(chuckles)
I just think you're funny.

17:26.279 --> 17:30.083
(chuckles) So I suppose
you want to tell me your SATs.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.918
Very much. But I won't.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.220
Tell me about you.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.454
I'm already homesick.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.389
I was always the kid
that didn't fit in.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.624
Middle child.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.127
Artsy. And I play

17:40.160 --> 17:42.729
the most unpopular
instrument there is:

17:42.762 --> 17:44.764
the jazz clarinet.

17:44.797 --> 17:45.832
Hmm!

17:47.400 --> 17:50.237
(playing lively jazz)

17:55.475 --> 17:58.077
You know your way
around a licorice stick, kid.

17:58.111 --> 18:01.047
You blow a mean fish hook
yourself, sister!

18:01.080 --> 18:04.117
-Let's talk normal now.
-Thank you.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.386
You know, today
I was hoping I would meet...

18:06.419 --> 18:08.255
-A lifelong friend?
-Yes!

18:08.288 --> 18:10.290
Here I am.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.391
*

18:11.424 --> 18:13.393
730 verbal, 790 math,

18:13.426 --> 18:15.061
800 telekinesis.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.164
(high-pitched whirr)

18:17.197 --> 18:18.998
740 verbal, 780 math,

18:19.031 --> 18:21.100
and I speak fluent cat!

18:21.134 --> 18:23.102
(meows)

18:23.136 --> 18:24.671
I have a friend!

18:25.705 --> 18:28.107
Oh. Maybe more than a friend.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.109
After that day,
I never looked back--

18:30.143 --> 18:32.812
except for all the time
I just spent looking back.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.814
(chuckles)
But I never doubted

18:34.847 --> 18:37.250
that who I am was good enough.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.352
(upbeat smooth jazz playing)

18:45.992 --> 18:49.061

19:00.207 --> 19:02.008
Light! Light...!

19:02.041 --> 19:03.943
Sweetie, you're one year old,

19:03.976 --> 19:07.314
and you're already the most
amazing thing I ever did.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.048
Daddy happy.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.050
Daddy very happy.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.120
Daddy euphoric!

19:14.153 --> 19:16.022
Aw. She's making up words.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.462
(to All in the Family theme):
* Boy, the way Nirvana played

19:22.495 --> 19:25.565
* Steroids caused a hit parade

19:25.598 --> 19:29.202
* Beanie Babies had it made

19:29.236 --> 19:32.372
* Those were the days

19:32.405 --> 19:36.175
* And we had real heroes then

19:36.209 --> 19:40.179
* Like Jar Jar Binks
and Qui-Gon Jinn *

19:40.213 --> 19:42.982
* Mister, we could use a man

19:43.015 --> 19:47.019
* Like Richard Simmons again

19:47.053 --> 19:49.989
* Watching films
like Gilbert Grape *

19:50.022 --> 19:53.393
* Then rewinding all the tape

19:53.426 --> 19:58.164
* Gee, our modem
dialed up great *

19:58.197 --> 20:02.034
(imitating modem
dialing up loudly)

20:02.068 --> 20:07.106
* Those were the days...

20:07.139 --> 20:10.042
Very nice.
See you in court.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.679
LISA:
