00:09.551 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:13.930


00:14.014 --> 00:15.348


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:32.407 --> 00:34.284


00:34.367 --> 00:37.454


00:38.204 --> 00:40.957


00:43.293 --> 00:45.295
Okay. Now with model rockets,

00:45.378 --> 00:48.089
it's real important
that when you launch them

00:48.173 --> 00:52.010
to be super careful not to block my sun.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.011
Copy that?

00:55.346 --> 00:57.557
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:59.392 --> 01:00.769
W-W-Whoa!

01:00.852 --> 01:02.979
Whoa! Whoa!

01:03.063 --> 01:04.773
Watch this.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.650


01:11.112 --> 01:13.823
Okay, okay, check it out! Check it out.
Look, look, look!

01:21.998 --> 01:23.208
Where's your rocket?

01:23.291 --> 01:25.543
I'm just happy watching you dorks
crash and burn.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.837
Well, prepare to be disappointed!

01:31.466 --> 01:33.718
Repecka, Starling,

01:33.802 --> 01:37.180
isn't it, like, funny
how bad everyone's rocket is?

01:37.263 --> 01:38.973
Like, so funny it's sad.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.768
So funny, Robin!

01:41.851 --> 01:43.520
Totally. I'm, like, crying.

01:43.603 --> 01:44.896
Check this out.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.114
Oh! New camp record!

01:54.197 --> 01:57.283
Not that that's saying much
with this total lack of competish.

01:57.367 --> 02:01.371
-Robin's rocket rules!
-Robin's rocket rules!

02:01.454 --> 02:03.706
Whoo! Ha!

02:03.790 --> 02:08.044
Hey, Stella, like, not trying is the same
as losing. You know that, right?

02:08.128 --> 02:11.548
Hey! If she even thought about trying,
she'd totally kick your--

02:11.631 --> 02:14.342
Why do you always act like
you're better than everyone?

02:14.425 --> 02:16.719
Because I am better than everyone.

02:16.803 --> 02:20.056
Oh, sweetie!
It's okay to be jealous of me.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.432
Everyone else is!

02:21.516 --> 02:22.976
Literally everyone.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.602
So jealous.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.105
Chuck, gonna need to borrow your tools.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.398
I think it's time to--

02:28.481 --> 02:30.608
Chuck, you built your rocket
with a soda bottle.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.068
Yeah. Why?

02:33.278 --> 02:35.780
Red. I think it's time to build
my own rocket

02:35.864 --> 02:38.533
and show
Little Miss Better Than Everyone, here,

02:38.616 --> 02:42.412
that she's not…
better than everyone… here.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.999
Well, I hope your rocket lands better
than your comeback, sweetie!

02:46.082 --> 02:47.500
Ooh! Hard peck!

02:47.584 --> 02:49.836
Ooh, nice rocket burn, Robin.

02:49.919 --> 02:50.837
Bye!

02:51.629 --> 02:54.591
Oh! I'm gonna enjoy wiping that smug grin
off her beak!

02:55.341 --> 02:59.095
"Ew. I'm, like, Robin.
And I think I'm better than everyone."

03:00.138 --> 03:03.766
You call that a well-made bed?
Mine is, like, so much better.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.355
You call that a dessert?
Mine's way better.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.611
That cloud looks like a hat.

03:15.111 --> 03:17.238
Hardly. It's a flying saucer.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.198
Yes! I imagined it better.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.701
-Whoo-hoo!

03:22.368 --> 03:24.287
And I have way better flashbacks.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.291
Oh! Glad to see you've given up
the rocket thing

03:28.374 --> 03:30.710
and just decided to play with this trash.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.587
Ha. Hilarious. Watch this.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.008
Ahh!

03:41.262 --> 03:44.349
You were right. That was hilarious.

03:45.141 --> 03:49.479
You know, maybe challenging Robin
at rocket building isn't the best idea.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.231
She's, like, really good at it.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.566
That's exactly why I have to beat her.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.658
Ow! Ooh! Eee! Ow!

04:01.741 --> 04:03.034
Still hilarious!

04:07.956 --> 04:10.041
Okay. Now that's just sad.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.960
Psst. Penley.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.212
Can you hook me up
with some high-end pig tech?

04:26.516 --> 04:28.351
Ooh!

04:28.434 --> 04:30.520
Now that's what I'm talking about.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.485
What do you think of this?

04:39.487 --> 04:41.030
Wait, I just need a sec.

04:42.573 --> 04:46.119
That went way better in my head.
I'm gonna go get a glass of water.

04:46.786 --> 04:50.373
Wow, that's, like, impressive…
Sorry, Robin.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.875
Ugh! Why does she always get up
in my beak?

04:52.959 --> 04:55.003
I mean, like, what did I ever do to her?

04:55.086 --> 04:59.132
What if her rocket, like,
goes higher than yours?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.468
Oh, it's going higher all right.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.305
Like, way higher.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.445
Good luck, Stella. You're my hero.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.656
-We'll never forget you!
-I'll be back in two minutes.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.743
That's two minutes too long!

05:32.832 --> 05:35.126
<i>Ground control to Stella. Do you copy?</i>

05:35.209 --> 05:37.587
Copy! Start countdown, Ground Control.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.339
Ten, nine, eight--

05:39.422 --> 05:40.340
-Let me!
-No!

05:41.132 --> 05:45.970
Seven, four, 90, six and a half,
four, 877, four, touchdown!

05:53.269 --> 05:56.064
What did I say about blocking my sun?

05:59.233 --> 06:01.402
And Robin's record is toast!

06:04.405 --> 06:06.365
Uh-oh. It's not stopping!

06:13.247 --> 06:17.126
Entering low Earth orbit!
Which is amazing!

06:17.210 --> 06:19.629
I just blew Robin's record
out of the water!

06:19.712 --> 06:22.131
Um, I don't think so.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.426
If I hadn't snuck aboard
and sabotaged your rocket,

06:25.510 --> 06:28.262
you'd never have gotten so high.
This is my record.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.388
You wish!

06:29.472 --> 06:32.350
Wait, what? You did what to my rocket?

06:32.433 --> 06:34.435
Yeah, I wasn't gonna let you
beat my record,

06:34.519 --> 06:37.438
but then the stupid hatch slammed shut
behind me and I got stuck here.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.524
Well, then I guess you got
what you deserve.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.234
Yep. The record!

06:41.317 --> 06:43.444
Victory strut, y'all!

06:43.528 --> 06:46.280
-Ooh! Ooh!

06:46.364 --> 06:48.199
Nuh-uh! No way.

06:48.282 --> 06:50.409
I built the rocket.
The record is mine.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.370
So, kiss my butt feathers.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.915
And since I was at the front
of the rocket,

06:55.998 --> 06:58.626
I was the first Splinterwood
camper in space,

06:58.709 --> 07:01.796
which outdoes anything you ever did, ever.

07:01.879 --> 07:05.758
Oh, actually, the rocket was spinning
when it passed into low earth orbit,

07:05.842 --> 07:08.928
meaning the back of it entered first,
which is where I was.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.764
First in space and in your face!

07:20.648 --> 07:22.817
We're drifting toward outer space!

07:22.900 --> 07:25.820
If we don't get this rocket moving,
we'll be lost forever!

07:25.903 --> 07:27.572
Good thing I'm here to save us.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.198
Not if I save us first!

07:29.282 --> 07:30.116
If anyone…

07:30.199 --> 07:32.160
<i>-…will save… me.</i>

07:32.243 --> 07:34.620
It's Stella. She's saying, "Save me!"

07:34.704 --> 07:35.788
We've gotta rescue her!

07:35.872 --> 07:39.083
All right, guys, let's get to work.
This is it! Your boy Chuck's got a plan.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.630
Look at her, thinking she's better than me
at saving our lives.

07:44.714 --> 07:48.759
She thinks she's so cool. Like she'll be
the one to keep us from a horrible death.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.597
Ew. Do you hear something?

07:52.680 --> 07:55.766
Our brave heroes make their way
toward the stranded rocket

07:55.850 --> 07:57.143
to rescue their friend!

07:57.226 --> 07:58.060
Oh no.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.770
It's a spectacular rescue,

07:59.854 --> 08:02.773
but one of the heroes really hopes
there's a bathroom on the rocket

08:02.857 --> 08:05.693
because he's been drinking
soda the whole time!

08:07.945 --> 08:10.615
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

08:11.365 --> 08:12.909
We're here to rescue you!

08:12.992 --> 08:14.619
You're as good as saved!

08:15.119 --> 08:18.331
Except that we seem to be
floating away in the wrong direction!

08:19.457 --> 08:21.459
I really gotta go pee-pee bad now!

08:22.502 --> 08:24.045
Don't worry!

08:24.128 --> 08:25.338
I'm comin' to save ya!

08:25.421 --> 08:28.549
Nuh-uh! If anyone's gonna be the first
camper to do a space rescue,

08:28.633 --> 08:30.134
it's gonna be me!

08:30.218 --> 08:31.636
Eat my space dust!

08:50.404 --> 08:51.614
He's going too fast!

08:51.697 --> 08:53.115
What do we do?

08:53.199 --> 08:54.200
Oh!

08:55.117 --> 08:56.118
Ha ha!

09:00.665 --> 09:03.918


09:08.798 --> 09:09.924
Okay, we got him!

09:13.427 --> 09:15.763
Whoopsy! My bad!

09:18.849 --> 09:21.978
Uh, can you do us a favor and stop trying
to rescue us?

09:22.061 --> 09:23.813
Yeah, we got this.

09:23.896 --> 09:27.275
You reroute the whatsamathingy
and I'll reconnect the thingamabob.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.484
Got it.

09:47.044 --> 09:47.920
Mommy.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.966
Now that's what I call a rescue!

09:52.049 --> 09:53.551
Oh, yeah!

09:54.510 --> 09:55.428
Gross.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.892
Great work on your, uh… rocket thingies.

10:02.476 --> 10:05.271
I hope it was, like, educational
or whatever.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.440
You know, I still don't like you,

10:07.523 --> 10:10.735
but it was kind of cool to have someone
challenge me for a change.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.237
It made me reach new heights. Literally.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.741
Yeah! Wanting to beat you made me
do something I never would have done.

10:16.824 --> 10:17.992
Hey, Penley!

10:21.621 --> 10:24.957
You can mark the new record
Stella and Robin.

10:27.043 --> 10:30.463
Um, actually, I think it should
be Robin and Stella.

10:32.423 --> 10:35.217
Don't you dare! It was totally me!

10:35.301 --> 10:37.762
-I don't think so.
-What?! What are you talking about?

10:37.845 --> 10:39.597
-No, you pushed the thingamabob.
-No!

10:39.680 --> 10:41.557
-I saved the boys--
-That was me.
