05:38.821 --> 05:42.617
Hey, why don't you ask her how
to say 'jailbait'... in Vietnamese?

05:45.661 --> 05:48.539
Look at him man, who does he think
he's kidding over there?

05:49.332 --> 05:54.171
Hey Languilli, you'd better get your ass back in this truck.
Or her father's going to come out and cut your dick off.

05:55.005 --> 05:57.799
Ok, girl... wait, wait...

05:58.759 --> 06:01.929
Who are you kidding man? You wouldn't know
what to do with her if you do get her.

06:04.348 --> 06:06.183

06:18.530 --> 06:21.407
Your dick will fall off if you

They'll keep you in the Philippines

06:28.248 --> 06:30.041
Get your ass back on that truck!

06:45.349 --> 06:46.684
Sergeant, Frants?

06:46.725 --> 06:49.979
I thought you bought a waterbuffalo

06:50.062 --> 06:51.523
Where the hell have
you been, young stuff?

06:51.606 --> 06:52.566

Round-eye.

07:13.129 --> 07:14.172
You didn't?

07:14.255 --> 07:16.299
She had her own trailer on the beach.

07:16.382 --> 07:17.300
Oh, no.

07:17.925 --> 07:19.802
I figured what can they do to me?

07:19.844 --> 07:23.472
Send me to Vietnam? I moved in with her.

07:24.432 --> 07:25.725
A round-eye?

07:25.766 --> 07:26.601
There it is.

07:26.642 --> 07:28.728
The Mama's and Papa's
found me on the beach.

07:29.437 --> 07:30.146
Surfing?

07:39.364 --> 07:40.908
Sit down, Vinstak

07:47.956 --> 07:50.918
What the hell are you
wearing that shit for?

07:52.211 --> 07:54.923
It's gonna dehydrate your ass
and not do you any good.

07:54.964 --> 07:57.842
But, Sarge, they told us at
Division training we had to wear...

07:59.636 --> 08:03.056
We had a... we had
a short time at once.

08:03.139 --> 08:06.851
Johnny, I forget his name...
he wore a flack jacket

08:06.976 --> 08:09.312
two helmets... and armour underwear.

08:09.896 --> 08:13.943
Ashau Valley. If your
time's up, your time's up.

08:17.905 --> 08:19.865
What's the Anshaw Valley?

09:14.297 --> 09:15.632
Hey, ladies, are you free tonight?

09:34.651 --> 09:37.614
Let's go. Which way is it?

09:43.453 --> 09:46.039
Goddamn, look at this!

09:47.081 --> 09:49.709
I'm going to put the new guys in your squad.
/Oh shit!

09:49.792 --> 09:51.252
Hey, don't 'oh shit' me, troop.

09:51.294 --> 09:54.506
The old man has me breaking-in another new Lieutenant.
He looks like Palmolive-fucking-soap.

09:54.589 --> 09:56.467
Yeah, well I don't need
this f-n-g shit, Worcester.

09:56.550 --> 09:58.969
Yeah, well write you Congressman
and you can tell him. I need a steak...

09:59.094 --> 10:01.347
a bucket of cold beer and a round-eye
to wrap my leg around.

10:04.225 --> 10:05.726
Lieutenant Eaden.
/Sergeant?

10:05.768 --> 10:07.061
How are you?

10:12.107 --> 10:16.363
Watch your backs. Come on this
isn't a parking lot for Christ's sake.

10:16.446 --> 10:17.447
Come on, Gaigin.

10:20.909 --> 10:22.202
Here you go.

10:23.453 --> 10:24.579
That all you got?

10:25.622 --> 10:27.541
What did they say that signal
for incoming rounds was?

10:27.624 --> 10:30.210
Hey man, I can't tell the difference
between incoming and outgoing.

10:30.293 --> 10:32.921
I dove off the shitter up at Evans
and it was our stuff going out.

10:33.004 --> 10:34.673
I think it's two long sirens.

10:34.756 --> 10:35.966
Don't worry about it.

10:36.049 --> 10:40.096
Hey man, I'm not worrying about it. I just think that it's
important to know the signals for incoming rounds, all right?

10:40.263 --> 10:42.557
Don't worry nobody's
getting in here tonight.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.559
What's the signal for ground attack?

10:44.642 --> 10:45.601
Three short ones.

10:45.643 --> 10:46.936
Green star cluster.

10:46.978 --> 10:49.897
Oh yeah, that's great for a night time,
what are we gonna do during the day?

10:49.981 --> 10:52.233
Did you know that bird shit and paratroopers
are the only things that fall out of the sky?

10:55.653 --> 10:58.115
Sarge. Are there any women here?

11:01.869 --> 11:03.495
Hey, I'm not screwing any whore.

11:04.496 --> 11:05.455
Shit!

11:05.539 --> 11:07.332
What man, you'd eat her pussy.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.460
Hey man, if you can't try it,
I don't eat it.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.463
A year is a long time, tellows.

11:19.053 --> 11:19.971
That's Clare.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.351
If she's fucking for peace man,
I'm on the wrong side.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.482
Stop it, back off.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.820
Cool it!

11:35.904 --> 11:37.864

14:27.668 --> 14:36.385
Hey, you were, as you were.

14:36.885 --> 14:46.771
The question is, how many of us have to boom boom before
those mean little bastards from the North show up.

14:46.855 --> 14:49.649
Now that's the question.

Actually, I highly recommend this plan for you men.
It's a good plan for the future.

15:43.956 --> 15:46.584
The white card should be
filled out by married men.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.962
This allows for joint access to
your funds in case of an emergency.

15:50.463 --> 15:52.340

it will be delivered free of charge. Questions?

16:41.891 --> 16:42.725
Brother blood.

16:42.809 --> 16:43.726

16:54.989 --> 16:57.491
Bangkok is not unbelievable man.

16:57.658 --> 16:59.410
What happened after
I got Med Evacuated

16:59.535 --> 17:01.662

You hear me?

17:01.745 --> 17:02.872
Speedy.
/Who?

17:02.955 --> 17:06.835
The shit burner from second squad.
/Traumatic cranial contusion. I couldn't ventilate him.

17:06.877 --> 17:08.837
Brother Jones got blown to shit.

17:08.878 --> 17:10.755
Who's Jones?
/The FNG man.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.215
He knew everything
the Temptations ever did.

17:13.258 --> 17:15.343
Make sure we got some
brothers in the squad.

17:15.426 --> 17:20.723
I don't want to hear no more of that rebel.
I lost my car on the mother fucking road.

17:20.807 --> 17:25.228
And I'm crying over you.

17:25.311 --> 17:30.067
Hey Sarge, Sarge. Look a minute.
I've got a flash for you.

17:31.485 --> 17:34.238
Some brother I was hanging out
with over at Delta company.

17:34.322 --> 17:35.907
Drives iron raven.

17:36.741 --> 17:41.120
Don't shit me, Sarge. Rumor has it
we're going back into the Ashau.

17:43.414 --> 17:44.665
Shit.

17:44.749 --> 17:49.713
Come on Sarge, man you know. I'm too short for that shit.
The Doc ain't gonna give me a profile.

17:49.796 --> 17:52.174
Why don't you see if there's a job
for me over at headquarters.

17:52.257 --> 17:56.094
They don't take niggers
back at headquarters, brother.

17:56.136 --> 17:58.472
All the white mother
fuckers are back there.

18:03.435 --> 18:05.354
Remove the protective
wrapping from the tooth brush.

18:05.437 --> 18:07.273
Put the wrapping next
to your left foot.

18:07.315 --> 18:09.901
Open the tooth paste with
the cap on top of wrapping.

18:09.943 --> 18:13.363
Now put general amount of
paste on the sterile bristles.

18:13.947 --> 18:17.951
People you will brush your teeth
in rapid verital motion for one minute.

18:18.535 --> 18:20.954
That's up and down for

18:22.288 --> 18:25.041
When I say Start, you turn
to your right, you brush. Ready?

18:27.126 --> 18:28.170
Brush.

18:32.341 --> 18:35.261
You may notice a granular taste.
That's pumice.

18:35.302 --> 18:38.639
It's puopse is to seal the teeth
and allow the flouride to penetrate.

18:39.473 --> 18:43.811
Gentlemen, in Vietnam, you will be
confronted by many organisms.

18:43.852 --> 18:48.650
In food, water, air...
that are foreign to Amercan bodies.

18:49.276 --> 18:55.532
Ringworm and Pataygo and Malaria,
ameobic dysentary and crotch rot.

18:56.491 --> 19:03.290
It has been found that proper dental hygene is important
component in maintaining of a healthy fighting man.

19:06.084 --> 19:08.754
What are you doing?

19:09.964 --> 19:11.757
Come on lighten up Bro.

19:22.268 --> 19:23.895

19:24.854 --> 19:28.691
Now did I tell you to spit?
/No, sir.

19:31.862 --> 19:34.573
If you wanna walk outta

20:29.171 --> 20:33.301
I want you to keep on eye on these guys.
In case we gotta go back to Ashau.

20:35.220 --> 20:36.721
Don't mean nothing.

20:38.890 --> 20:41.268
Man, don't these people
play no Tammy Wynette.

20:46.898 --> 20:48.400
Did you sleep last night?

20:48.483 --> 20:49.859

20:49.943 --> 20:52.280
What do you mean

20:54.782 --> 20:55.992
Did you sleep?

20:58.619 --> 20:59.954

21:16.972 --> 21:19.892
You fucking, new guys will do

21:19.933 --> 21:22.769
You'll walk on trails, kickcans... sleep

on the block.

21:26.148 --> 21:30.277
On guard at night you'll write letters, play with your organ...
and think of your girl back home. Forget her.

21:30.319 --> 21:33.489
Some hair head has her on her right now...
and is telling her to fuck for peace.

21:33.573 --> 21:34.991
This is Han.

21:41.831 --> 21:45.335
Those of you who are foolish will think
of him as... gook, slope, slant or dink.

21:45.418 --> 21:46.544
He is your enemy.

21:46.628 --> 21:51.424
He came over on the Chieu Hoi programme.
And he will go back there after he fattens on C-rations.

21:51.507 --> 21:55.054
And he will be hunting your
young asss in the Ashau Valley.

21:55.137 --> 21:57.014
Now forget about this Viet Cong shit.

21:58.224 --> 22:01.810
What you'll encounter out there is...
hard core. NVA, north Vietnamese...

22:01.936 --> 22:04.188
motivated, highly trained
and well equipped.

22:05.231 --> 22:07.733
If you meet Hanor his cousins,
you will give him respect.

22:07.858 --> 22:10.945
And refer to those little bastards
as the Nathanial Victor.

22:11.528 --> 22:16.534
Meet'em twice and survive, you will
call him mister Nathanial Victor.

22:17.369 --> 22:22.624
People, I am tired... of filling
body bags with your dumb fucking mistakes.

22:24.501 --> 22:25.877
Do you think this funny?

22:29.673 --> 22:30.757
Alphabet.

22:30.799 --> 22:32.175
Languilli.

22:33.344 --> 22:36.847
Han is closing in on your position.
It's night, look at me.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.850
I'm gonna save your life
and your gonna save mine.

22:41.602 --> 22:43.396
It's night, it's raining.

22:43.437 --> 22:46.399
While you're thinking about peace,
love and whether or not we should be in Vietnam.

22:46.482 --> 22:50.111
Han is going to cut your fucking throat. And your sleeping.
/No, Sergeant.

22:50.194 --> 22:53.865
You've been humping the boonies for months.
Your turn to sleep, your allowed to sleep.

22:54.032 --> 22:57.160
What do you think Han is going to do?
Ls he going to wake up Alphabet and smile?

22:57.244 --> 22:58.662
And talk about women?

22:58.745 --> 23:02.040
Mister Nathanial Victor gets his
rocks off watching you die.

23:02.916 --> 23:05.294
Some of you think you have problems
because your're against the war.

23:05.377 --> 23:09.464
You demonstrated in school... you wear peace symbols on your steel.
And you have attitudes.

23:12.759 --> 23:16.055
I'm orphan, my brother's queer, the city of
Chicago got the clap from my sister.

23:16.097 --> 23:17.765
Mum drinks, Dad coughs blood.

23:17.849 --> 23:20.143
I have ring worm, emersion
foot... the incurable crud

23:20.226 --> 23:23.521
and the draught ruined my chances
of being a brain surge on people.

23:23.605 --> 23:25.231
You have no problem.

23:28.151 --> 23:29.611
Except me.

23:31.446 --> 23:32.780
And him.

24:39.142 --> 24:40.269
Hey, pal.

24:43.814 --> 24:46.650
You know where I can
find general Rufferman?

24:47.192 --> 24:51.238
Not friend of mine.
He is major genral, two stars.

24:51.321 --> 24:53.824
I am supposed to deliver
this to trailer to him.

24:53.865 --> 24:55.909
And I can't find anyone to sign for it.

24:56.034 --> 24:57.912
Hey l'll sign for it.

24:57.954 --> 24:59.831
I'm responsible for this.

25:00.456 --> 25:01.499
Well look at it.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.168
Keepin the army forever to pay it off.

25:04.210 --> 25:08.047
Everybody shoots at me.
Especially grunts.

25:10.633 --> 25:13.553
I'm just rolling highway
sinder hunt and seek.

25:14.178 --> 25:16.556
Listen, maybe you can
get a marine to sign for it.

25:16.639 --> 25:21.937
Yeah. Yeah, thanks a lot.
Those guys are dancing.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.333
This is one weird place.

25:43.209 --> 25:48.506
Seventeen fucking wake up
and l'll never eat this shit again.

25:48.590 --> 25:52.385
You hear what I'm saying sarge?
/We are in the army, man.

25:53.470 --> 25:55.180
What are you gonna do when
you are back in the world?

25:56.389 --> 26:00.186
I got places to go,
things to do, people to see.

26:00.228 --> 26:01.938
Yeah but how are you gonna act?

26:03.940 --> 26:08.819
Like a PFC, Private fucking civilian.

26:08.903 --> 26:11.948
You are talkinig, you don't know
what you're saying, brother.

26:12.031 --> 26:13.950
You ever heard of boony rap?

26:14.033 --> 26:16.869
Fuck this, shit on that, no fucking way.

26:16.953 --> 26:19.206
I love that mother fucking bastards.

26:19.289 --> 26:22.000
You back off Motown
cuz I got my fucking act.

26:27.130 --> 26:30.259
Look man, I got my act together. OK?

26:30.300 --> 26:32.219
My shit's straight man.

26:33.053 --> 26:36.598
You know a straighter and more intellegent brother
in first platoon then me?

26:37.724 --> 26:41.145
Hey listen up, he's got college.

26:42.897 --> 26:45.692
One time I went home
on special emergency leave,

26:45.775 --> 26:48.111
My mama made me a
special meal man with

26:48.152 --> 26:53.283
everything I love, I mean greens,
fresh vegetable, potatos, candies...

26:53.324 --> 26:55.034
I happened to like baked ham.

26:55.159 --> 27:00.624
So whole my family was there, and I said to myself, Motown
you got these people fooled.

27:00.708 --> 27:03.752
I mean the day before that,
we were humping in Ashau valley,

27:03.836 --> 27:06.255
and now I'm home with my family.

27:06.338 --> 27:09.341
And I'm skatin man.
No problems. Number one.

27:09.425 --> 27:13.679
I smile at my mama. Great meal, ma.

27:14.847 --> 27:17.766
Would you please pass the fucking potatoes.

27:20.103 --> 27:24.274
The ham is fucking A, ma.

27:25.567 --> 27:29.404
You don't know how... how
fucking great it is to be home.

27:33.992 --> 27:35.869
How you gonna act, huh?

27:36.578 --> 27:38.538
You really want to know, Motown?

27:41.709 --> 27:44.503
I'm gonna walk down Central Avenue.

27:45.212 --> 27:47.590
My jump boots, my medals.

27:49.717 --> 27:51.636
Shit, it's gonna be all right.

27:52.386 --> 27:54.096
You'd better not wear your uniform.

27:55.097 --> 27:56.891
Who's talking to you?

28:01.146 --> 28:07.778
This man... has been fighting for the
fucking United States of white America.

28:08.904 --> 28:14.534
And you going to try to advise him...
that he can't wear his jump boots.

28:14.576 --> 28:19.206
You guys... don't know shit.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.728
Commending General believes that
one of the most depressing problems

28:40.812 --> 28:44.358
we face in Vietnam today
is Vineraal disease.

28:44.441 --> 28:48.862
We have found the best way of contracting any one of
the nine known strands

28:48.946 --> 28:55.411
of Syphilis, and or Gohnorrea is
to avoid contact with the indigenous.

28:55.494 --> 28:57.830
Vietnamese female personnel.

29:00.874 --> 29:07.132
However, remember, lie da
homo chai bokoo eeon.

29:08.216 --> 29:11.136
Lie da homo chai bokoo eeon.

29:11.219 --> 29:15.181
It' the same anywhere Galvan.
You got to know the right words to score.

29:18.935 --> 29:20.395
L'll go get us some shampoo.

29:37.830 --> 29:38.789
Tafee.

29:38.831 --> 29:40.291
What are you doing?

29:41.959 --> 29:43.210
It's called meditation.

29:48.216 --> 29:49.760
How do you know
whether or not it's working?

29:51.011 --> 29:53.972
Incoming!

30:07.362 --> 30:10.823
Cold steel. Check point five... Two. Over.

30:11.824 --> 30:13.451
Fire Major. Over.

30:17.538 --> 30:19.499
Fire Major. Over.

30:21.960 --> 30:24.964
They must have a
spotter in that tree line.

30:47.237 --> 30:49.906
Fire! Standing by

30:52.576 --> 30:56.496
Rounds out. Rounds out. Rounds out.

31:34.453 --> 31:36.997
Cease fire. Cease fire!

31:46.174 --> 31:49.761
Red 16. This is 16.
What's the situation. Over.

31:51.304 --> 31:56.309
Red 16. This is 16.
What's the situation. Over.

32:17.498 --> 32:18.457
Who is it?

32:20.000 --> 32:25.172
How the hell do I know.
He's got no goddamn head.

32:27.801 --> 32:29.636
It's one of the new guys.

32:30.845 --> 32:35.225
You got to tell these men to put an extra set of I.D.
Tags on their boots one each.

32:35.308 --> 32:39.729
Then this kind of shit wouldn't happen.
How the hell am I supposed to identify these people.

32:42.899 --> 32:44.859
Now you take it easy, Doc.

32:54.912 --> 32:57.039
L'll take it any way I can.

33:05.464 --> 33:07.842
I've got to know who you are.

33:11.680 --> 33:13.056
How's this. How's this?

33:21.481 --> 33:23.358
Where's Gates?
He's in there all night.

33:23.984 --> 33:26.904
I know I'm going to be next.
I know that, Goddammit!

33:27.696 --> 33:31.159
I'm next, Doc.
/You ain't next!

33:31.242 --> 33:32.368
I'm next, Doc.

33:32.410 --> 33:36.956
I don't care what y'all say.
You got that life all you want.

33:37.040 --> 33:42.879
Now we'll see, Goddammit.
I'm tired of all your shit.

33:42.921 --> 33:46.090
Seven cards are squared.
Single titties are wild.

33:49.261 --> 33:50.179
You say it boss.

34:43.484 --> 34:47.071
Yeah, you could fart in a balloon and
paint it red and Marine would love it.

34:47.905 --> 34:48.822
It's true.

34:56.164 --> 34:57.749
Your too big for her.

35:00.794 --> 35:03.422
What's Elstavitz doing? Vinstock.

35:03.505 --> 35:06.383
I don't know Sarge.
/You should.

35:06.466 --> 35:07.968
Is he...

35:08.677 --> 35:11.097
You white boys are strange about that.

35:13.141 --> 35:16.185
Don't get lost Beanie. Wooahh.

35:17.061 --> 35:20.189
Watcha doin' in Vietnam. Boy.

35:23.401 --> 35:25.111
Volunteered, bro.

35:25.194 --> 35:29.157
You know, the brothers
are here, because we're black.

35:29.699 --> 35:31.326
They don't think we're educated.

35:31.869 --> 35:33.662
That's bullshit.

35:39.043 --> 35:43.672
Say what FNG? FNG?

36:00.023 --> 36:02.359
Hey Andy, lack off, lack off!

36:02.400 --> 36:08.240
My name isn't Alphabet. It's Languilly, Vinny.
My first name is Vincent.

36:09.991 --> 36:11.910
What's my name, Doc?

36:13.621 --> 36:15.248
You're name is Vincent.

36:18.292 --> 36:19.919
All right, get him outta here.

36:22.880 --> 36:27.885
You GI's are all...

36:31.264 --> 36:33.141
You people will not
die on me in combat.

36:33.225 --> 36:34.851
Galvin was good.
He always did everything right.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.521
What difference does it make. We've been up and down
this same terrain since I got here. For what?

36:37.604 --> 36:38.730
All right look.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.732
When you get home.
You can throw your boots away.

36:40.774 --> 36:42.985
Grow a beard, become
a Goddam hippie protestor.

36:43.068 --> 36:43.860
I don't want to hear this shit.

36:43.944 --> 36:46.321
Look, I know too many
Goddamm names, Wortchester.

36:46.905 --> 36:49.783
And I don't think one of them is
worth all of Vietnam Republic of...

36:49.908 --> 36:52.160
Look just don't fall apart on your people, Francz.
/Oh why not?

36:52.786 --> 36:55.540
So I can teach 'em how to fill sand bags and burn shit.
/Hey!

36:56.583 --> 36:58.876
They're gonna need you in
the Ashau. We're going back in.

36:59.377 --> 37:01.045
What the hell you think
I brought you here for.

40:55.666 --> 40:58.502
Red six, Red six.
Red one six Charlie. Over.

40:58.544 --> 40:59.838
Red six. Over.

40:59.921 --> 41:01.715
We got LG secure.

41:01.756 --> 41:03.008
Negative contact. Over.

41:03.174 --> 41:06.845
Yo Mire! Francz. Smitty!
Move these people out.

41:08.972 --> 41:11.016
You'll do fine LT. Just fine.

41:13.393 --> 41:14.936
These guys know
what they're doing.

41:14.978 --> 41:16.521
Oh yeah, most definitely.

41:29.910 --> 41:33.456
10-May-69

42:30.975 --> 42:35.020
Fuck you!
All of you mother fuckers!

42:40.067 --> 42:40.609
Fuck!

42:55.333 --> 42:55.959
Bitch!

42:59.296 --> 43:00.880
Movin up Mac, on line!

43:03.843 --> 43:06.262
Washburn, Beletsky,
Bienstock. Move out!

43:07.430 --> 43:09.724
Hey! Gimme some ammo!

43:11.559 --> 43:12.935
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

43:13.853 --> 43:15.313
Get down! Get down!

43:15.354 --> 43:17.315
Give it to me! Give it to me!

43:17.356 --> 43:20.151
You're giving it to me,
you fucking idiot! Give it!

43:22.403 --> 43:23.864
Tafee, Gaigin, Move up!

43:23.905 --> 43:28.327
Move! Keep going! Comon!
Move! Goddamnit! Mother fucker.

43:39.046 --> 43:42.674
Fuck! Got to move in...

44:09.036 --> 44:12.414
Doc! They got Mac! They got Mac!

44:15.751 --> 44:17.628
Did you see him?
/No.

44:19.046 --> 44:20.130
We got a blood trail.

44:20.172 --> 44:21.799
Find the little bastard.

44:38.191 --> 44:40.360
You're on point.
/Me?

44:40.402 --> 44:43.738
You've got no friendlies out there.
Got a full load.

46:20.298 --> 46:23.468
Nathanial Victor. FNG type.
Walking around the Ashau

46:23.510 --> 46:26.221
with a half a canteen,
that makes a lot of noise.

46:27.890 --> 46:28.724
Where's the body?

46:32.019 --> 46:35.940
Maggie Kung fleet foot, face full of
black soot talking at the heat put

46:36.023 --> 46:39.110
plants in the bed but don't stop them
anyway. Maggie says all right.

46:39.193 --> 46:43.072
Here it is, October 19th.
We have been here six months.

46:43.155 --> 46:46.075
Now that's half way. All right?
Now I'm going to mark myself in blue.

46:46.158 --> 46:49.579
But I got different color pens for everybody.
You can be red if you want to be. O.K.

46:49.621 --> 46:51.999
But what I gotta know is did Washburn
get here the same day as us?

46:52.082 --> 46:53.500
Yes.
/O.K.

46:54.251 --> 46:57.254
And that other guy and alphabet the day before.
/Thank you sir.

46:58.547 --> 46:59.840
Hey guys, check this out.

47:02.259 --> 47:03.719
Love this Camaro.

47:03.802 --> 47:05.762
It's you. It's a ride, man.

47:15.732 --> 47:17.650
We did good today, didn't we?

47:19.110 --> 47:21.821
We got our cherries busted
today, didn't we Sarge?

47:25.783 --> 47:27.410
One of my people got killed.

47:29.455 --> 47:30.831
That's all that happened today.

47:37.296 --> 47:40.424
You knew that man wasn't going to
slack off because he was short.

47:43.260 --> 47:45.429
You knew that brother
was going do his job.

47:45.596 --> 47:47.473
Then why didn't you put him on profile.

47:47.598 --> 47:50.727
Because... he is one healthy individual.

47:50.810 --> 47:54.981
I've got people in this fucking platoon
who are so sick they wouldn't be allowed in the hospital.

47:55.065 --> 47:57.776
But out here they have to
ruck up, move out and press on.

47:59.486 --> 48:00.987
It don't mean nothing, man.

48:01.071 --> 48:02.489
It don't mean nothing...

48:05.617 --> 48:06.618
Come on, man...

48:06.701 --> 48:10.498
You owe it to yourself... yourself.

48:19.298 --> 48:22.259
It don't mean nothing. Not a thing man.

48:22.343 --> 48:44.032
It don't mean nothing. Not a thing.

48:44.074 --> 48:48.161
Right. You don't mean
nothing brother, not a thing.

48:48.245 --> 48:54.794
It don't mean nothing man,
not a thing. Nothing.

49:11.020 --> 49:15.441
We got a... we got McDaniels
body on a trailor truck.

49:20.863 --> 49:23.324
All he wanted to do was go
home in his jump boots.

49:27.036 --> 49:29.038
Couldn't believe they called him a jerk.

49:30.706 --> 49:31.958
And worse.

49:35.837 --> 49:40.675
Ya know, people get hurt out here.

49:40.717 --> 49:45.096
C'mon. Don't tell me he died for God,
country and one-hundred
and first airborne...

49:45.180 --> 49:48.058
Hey man, I'd never
say that shit to anybody.

49:50.018 --> 49:51.227
Dan didn't die for anything.

49:51.311 --> 49:55.566
He didn't leave his goddamn
guts on a goddamn trail in
goddamn Ashaw Valley.

49:55.608 --> 49:58.736
For a home town medal
or any of that bullshit.

50:02.365 --> 50:05.534
Cranked his automatic weapon
and took it out. For you and for

50:05.576 --> 50:09.038
the third squad. Man, don't you
give him anything less.

50:11.791 --> 50:13.961
You get out of this valley, Worcester.

50:15.879 --> 50:17.506
I'm gonna kick your ass.

50:21.969 --> 50:24.930
Battalion wants us to go back to
where Frantz made contact today.

50:24.972 --> 50:28.809
They say there are some stragglers
left on this area Hill 937.

50:28.892 --> 50:31.812
Those KIA's were clean and well
equipped. They weren't stragglers.

50:31.853 --> 50:36.484
Military Intelligence says there is no organized...
Military Intelligence could fuck up a wet dream, sir.

50:36.567 --> 50:41.364
All right man, let's call it. All right? We're on the same side here, right?
Tomorrow morning we'll just get our people quietly off this hill.

50:41.531 --> 50:46.369
Tomorrow we'll recon 937,call in alog
bird for hot chow and clean socks.

50:47.578 --> 50:49.789
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?
/Roger that.

50:51.791 --> 50:56.338
Murphy's calling in. H and I delta line
tango detail november side

50:56.422 --> 50:59.341
Squad leaders make sure
your people have

50:59.425 --> 51:03.971
dry socks, clean water,
salt fill, ammo, just in case.

51:08.309 --> 51:10.686
Alright gather around.
C'mon. Listen up.

51:14.607 --> 51:17.277
8:00 hours we're go back in.

51:26.202 --> 51:28.204
Red Six 1-6 Charlie. Over.

51:30.206 --> 51:35.379
The 1-6 Charlie preparing to assault
the 3-0 north of the faze line. Over.

51:36.797 --> 51:38.382
All right, we're getting 2 T small arms.

51:38.466 --> 51:41.135
May 11
From up there Black Jack wants
up to mop up any stragglers.

51:41.218 --> 51:45.723
First and second squad and move out from here.
I want you to take your people and move them in a flanking position.

51:46.390 --> 51:48.559
Make believers out of
these sorry ass bastards.

51:52.480 --> 51:54.650
O.K. Let's move it.
Second squad. Move on.

51:55.817 --> 51:56.985
First squad. Move out.

51:58.153 --> 51:59.237
This isn't the plan we worked out man.

51:59.321 --> 52:00.822
We're supposed to be
going up that other hill.

52:00.906 --> 52:05.160
It's the same old shit man.
Man and bird wants to play war.

52:32.772 --> 52:36.110
Red six... out this is 1-6 out...
Brad!! Move your people!

52:47.204 --> 52:50.958
Red six... out this is 1-6 out mark
four coordinates for cold steel. Over.

52:51.041 --> 52:51.792
Duffy!

52:53.711 --> 52:56.381
Take your weapons forward until
your covering far into the friendlies.

52:57.048 --> 52:58.383
Move. Move. Move.

53:00.302 --> 53:02.721
Put you around
seventy five meters down.

53:12.897 --> 53:13.982
That's what I wanted.

53:24.910 --> 53:27.413
These proper radio procedure...

53:59.280 --> 54:00.531
Hear from your old lady?

54:02.617 --> 54:03.952
Ever happened.

54:27.393 --> 54:29.812
Languilli, remember the basic?

54:29.812 --> 54:32.982
They told us the way to cover an eye
in case the flareoes so that we lose our night vision?

54:33.065 --> 54:33.816
They said that.

54:33.899 --> 54:35.401
OK, so what they meant?

54:36.151 --> 54:38.989
Does it matter if which eye we cover?

54:39.072 --> 54:43.076
Good eye for the night vision
or the one for the flare.

54:43.827 --> 54:48.331
Beletsky do you stay awake at night thing of
the things you should worry about?

55:04.098 --> 55:05.433
What are you doing?

55:05.433 --> 55:07.018
We were just having
some hot chocolate.

55:08.102 --> 55:10.104
You here anything.
/Nothing.

55:10.187 --> 55:13.691
Camp on the Delta Post.
Same same. Negative sit rep.

55:13.858 --> 55:15.609
Looks like we're gettin' out
of here tomorrow.

55:15.776 --> 55:18.529
I'm going straight to the PX
and ordering that Firebird.

55:20.449 --> 55:21.783
What happened to the Camaro?

55:26.121 --> 55:28.123
My dad won't drive
anything but a Buick.

55:37.799 --> 55:39.384
Push in on the bullshit net.

55:40.303 --> 55:41.471
What's the bullshit net?

55:41.471 --> 55:42.722
Hanoi Hanna.

55:42.805 --> 55:46.142
Best sounds in the valley.
And boy does she have a rap.

55:46.809 --> 55:48.144
We love you too much...

55:48.227 --> 55:51.564
drop your weapons and Uncle Ho
will give youa water buffalo...

55:51.648 --> 55:53.816
your own rice paddy to shit in.

55:57.070 --> 56:01.659
Sometimes they get American assholes...
to tell us what assholes we are.

56:04.161 --> 56:06.163
No lie, man. It's a trip.

56:06.997 --> 56:09.416
American soldiers... and marines

56:09.583 --> 56:15.172
embrace the heroic people of Vietnam...
like many of your heroic countrymen...

56:16.173 --> 56:19.176
why fight the heroic
people's army... while your own

56:19.259 --> 56:23.515
Government betrays you... and the heroic
American friends of Vietnam...

56:23.515 --> 56:26.101
If you have to smoke it at nigh
put a poncho over your head.

56:26.184 --> 56:31.189
And I would like to send this special dedication...
to the Screaming Eagles in the Ashau Valley.

56:32.273 --> 56:35.694
You may be killed any
time day or night...

56:35.777 --> 56:39.280
like your shadow, death is following you...

56:39.364 --> 56:41.200
Everywhere.

56:49.542 --> 56:51.877
Bad dream.

56:56.465 --> 56:58.467
How much am I supposed to
remember all this shit.

56:58.551 --> 57:01.470
Panchos over your head,
no half canteens.

57:01.470 --> 57:05.726
Dog tags on your boots.
Carry the claimor detonator while your setting them up.

57:05.809 --> 57:08.729
Orange pills once a week,
whites daily, daily.

57:09.313 --> 57:13.400
Oh don't ever walk on trails.
Boot in the sock. Harrows on the water.

57:13.483 --> 57:16.903
Secure your frags.
And now, now this bullshit.

57:16.987 --> 57:19.906
And the whole time, I'm worried
I might forget something.

57:48.437 --> 57:50.105
All right, on your feet, wake up...

57:50.189 --> 57:51.440
it's time to earn your combat pay.

57:51.440 --> 57:53.192
Come on.
/Come on. Let's go.

57:54.860 --> 57:56.445
Hey Motown, fuck you!

57:56.528 --> 57:58.280
I need some goddamn boots, Sarge.

57:58.364 --> 58:00.366
My whole fucking body hurts.

58:00.449 --> 58:01.617
My dick hurts!

58:01.617 --> 58:03.119
Then drop ten and beat it.

58:04.037 --> 58:05.789
I don't want to hear
anymore of this shit.

58:06.456 --> 58:08.124
Now you get your
head out of your asses.

58:08.958 --> 58:10.961
Black Jack wants us to take this hill.

58:10.961 --> 58:12.462
What's he going to do with it?

58:15.215 --> 58:18.051
Pave it and turn it
into a goddamn parking lot.

58:18.635 --> 58:19.803
Now move out.

58:34.235 --> 58:37.154
Cold steel, cold steel
this is 1-6 alpha, over.

58:37.238 --> 58:39.407
Tell 6 that the little bastards
have got some Claimors in the trees

58:39.490 --> 58:40.658
And they're blowing the shit out of us.

58:40.658 --> 58:42.243
So get us some goddamn fire support.

58:42.326 --> 58:45.163
Cold steel, cold steel.
This is 1-6 alpha, over.

58:47.499 --> 58:48.917
Come in 2-0

58:49.001 --> 58:50.836
There wounded out could be
pressing fire from that bunk line.

58:50.919 --> 58:52.004
Pressing fire from that bunk line.

58:52.087 --> 58:52.587
No shit.

58:52.754 --> 58:54.840
Worcester, pull these men out.

58:56.758 --> 58:58.176
Move it out! Move it out!!

59:10.273 --> 59:12.275
My leg! Fuck!

01:00:11.671 --> 01:00:13.255
You're mine! Mother fucker!

01:00:31.942 --> 01:00:33.360
You fuckin' stink!

01:00:34.194 --> 01:00:34.945
Duffy!

01:00:41.785 --> 01:00:42.619
Watch out!

01:00:49.043 --> 01:00:51.629
Clear this area Motown!
Cover it point blank!

01:00:51.713 --> 01:00:53.297
Set up that gun!

01:00:56.301 --> 01:00:56.968
Where's Doc?

01:00:59.053 --> 01:01:02.140
Get him and the horn and tell him
we got his goddamn bunker!

01:01:03.057 --> 01:01:04.475
Run the horn.

01:01:04.559 --> 01:01:05.643
I can't hear you.

01:01:09.315 --> 01:01:11.233
It's 1-6 out there over!

01:01:15.988 --> 01:01:17.156
C'mon, help me down there.

01:01:17.239 --> 01:01:19.158
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:01:19.241 --> 01:01:20.409
Get down there.

01:01:22.328 --> 01:01:23.829
Talk to me! Talk to me!

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:30.503
Say Alphabet! Alphabet! Say it!

01:01:31.838 --> 01:01:35.342
Cmon Duffy! Duffy! Say Alphabet!

01:02:02.203 --> 01:02:03.120
Sarge,

01:02:04.288 --> 01:02:07.124
I asked everybody who they think.

01:02:08.459 --> 01:02:11.797
Nobody did it. Was it you?

01:02:11.963 --> 01:02:13.715
Maybe he died of natural causes.

01:02:17.135 --> 01:02:18.804
Half his head was blown away.

01:02:19.638 --> 01:02:21.390
Sounds like a natural cause to me.

01:02:21.556 --> 01:02:23.225
When can you get him out of here?

01:02:25.227 --> 01:02:28.730
In a boot coot fucked up dude from
the second squad ahead of Duffy.

01:02:29.482 --> 01:02:30.817
Hey, it don't mean nothing.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.488
Where's my weapon?

01:03:11.359 --> 01:03:13.278
We have taken the bunker

01:03:13.361 --> 01:03:14.946
And are preparing to move up the hill.

01:03:15.113 --> 01:03:16.364
All right. Worcester.

01:03:27.625 --> 01:03:30.128
Let's move people
and take this fuckin' hill.

01:03:31.964 --> 01:03:32.965
Let's go!

01:04:37.616 --> 01:04:40.536
Get me some ammo!

01:04:41.787 --> 01:04:45.207
Duffy! I'm coming.

01:05:22.413 --> 01:05:25.583
No. No cease fire.

01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:32.173
Hold it up there firing
at our people. Hold it up!

01:05:44.603 --> 01:05:50.776
Stop it! Man! God dammit!
Jesus Christ!

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.604
They said they are gonna
send some resupply today.

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:17.868
Get back on your horn and tell them we, our people,
need food and water now not later.

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:24.875
This is 16 alpha over.

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:33.467
Take a look at that map.

01:07:37.805 --> 01:07:38.723
Sergent.

01:07:44.896 --> 01:07:46.731
We are in Ashau valley.

01:07:47.648 --> 01:07:50.985
And we ain't going no where
except back up to that goddamn hill.

01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:59.328
L'll get you a map.

01:08:07.336 --> 01:08:10.506
You put the tape in there
and you press that button.

01:08:12.424 --> 01:08:13.926
It's from my girl Claire.

01:08:13.926 --> 01:08:15.177
Just don't use all my juice.

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:21.935
Now that's immoral, unjust and illegal.

01:08:22.018 --> 01:08:23.269
Get this Beenie.
/What?

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:28.441
Oh my God! They're huge.

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:34.948
She likes to lie naked on the beach.
And have her boyfriend read the profit to her.

01:08:35.031 --> 01:08:38.035
Oh yeah, he's probably
a long haired, foureyed faggot.

01:08:38.703 --> 01:08:41.706
I just don't know what to say. I-

01:08:41.706 --> 01:08:44.542
I don't know what time
it is where you are.

01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:48.462
I'd like to wrap his
long hair around my body...

01:08:48.462 --> 01:08:51.716
while he makes love
to me all night long.

01:08:51.799 --> 01:08:54.301
I had dinner with your Mom and Dad.

01:08:54.385 --> 01:08:58.473
We read all your letters and looked at
the pictures you sent.

01:08:58.473 --> 01:09:02.894
She became his love prisoner.
She would do anything for him.

01:09:02.978 --> 01:09:06.814
Jesus Christ, I'm never going to get another haircut
as long as I fucking live.

01:09:07.314 --> 01:09:08.984
If you can... Joe.

01:09:09.818 --> 01:09:12.321
Try to smile more in the pictures.

01:09:12.904 --> 01:09:14.238
It would help your Mother.

01:09:14.906 --> 01:09:16.742
Your dad didn't say much.

01:09:17.242 --> 01:09:19.078
We both know what he's like.

01:09:19.996 --> 01:09:24.584
Katherine says... he gets up
early every morning and...

01:09:24.667 --> 01:09:29.671
watches the news. And he eats his
dinner in front of the TV at night.

01:09:30.256 --> 01:09:32.008
I think he's looking for you.

01:09:33.009 --> 01:09:38.680
I'm glad you have such good friends
like... like Bienstock and Langarelli.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.100
Languilli.

01:09:40.184 --> 01:09:42.185
Galvan and Frantz.

01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:48.274
I, I want you to know one thing...

01:09:50.109 --> 01:09:53.863
l'll always be true to you.
L'll wait for you.

01:09:55.366 --> 01:09:58.619
I know it must be very difficult
for you over there and...

01:09:58.702 --> 01:10:01.790
If you can't be true...

01:10:02.707 --> 01:10:05.794
if you can't wait... l'll understand.

01:10:06.628 --> 01:10:08.380
I know you love me.

01:10:09.714 --> 01:10:13.051
I love this woman,
she's telling him to get laid.

01:10:16.721 --> 01:10:21.143
I wish you weren't there.
I wish none of you were there.

01:10:23.145 --> 01:10:28.317
But I'm proud of you Joe.
I, I, I just don't think it's fair...

01:10:28.401 --> 01:10:33.322
that everybody is back here... acting...
acting like nothing is going on.

01:10:33.322 --> 01:10:38.077
Their lives are the same.
It's just not fair.

01:10:39.328 --> 01:10:42.165
And I don't believe
what they say about you.

01:10:44.084 --> 01:10:45.168
Anyhow...

01:10:47.004 --> 01:10:50.590
I don't care because I love all of you.

01:10:51.925 --> 01:10:58.432
Especially you, my darling.
Especially you my...

01:11:01.936 --> 01:11:03.187
Take it easy with that.

01:11:04.439 --> 01:11:05.523
L'll take it anyway I can.

01:11:05.606 --> 01:11:07.608
I told you not to use all the batteries.

01:11:10.278 --> 01:11:12.280
It's the goddamn nigger
music you listen to.

01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:18.953
All right, come on. Break it up.

01:11:18.953 --> 01:11:20.955
Alphabet, put shovel down.

01:11:23.709 --> 01:11:24.960
Now what's happening here?

01:11:26.962 --> 01:11:28.130
War's happening.

01:11:47.609 --> 01:11:52.655

It's definatly the vet.

01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:54.053
You can't score on the vet.

01:12:54.137 --> 01:12:59.517
Oh man, stop fingure fucking dream

01:12:59.559 --> 01:13:01.644

I bombomed mama san and in the garbage dump under
deuce and a half while a girlsan reading a magazine

01:13:06.734 --> 01:13:10.654

You can score in the vet.

01:13:10.738 --> 01:13:13.240
You owe it to yourself.

01:13:13.323 --> 01:13:16.243
Hey sarge, do you think they
gotta send us foot powder?

01:13:16.243 --> 01:13:19.371
Stop worry about nothing for christ'sake.

01:13:19.496 --> 01:13:23.083
Go back to world with bad feet.
What can they do to you, send you to Vietnam?

01:13:23.751 --> 01:13:26.421
I'm a salesman. This feet are my life.

01:13:27.505 --> 01:13:29.924
My godamn skin's peeled off.

01:13:30.592 --> 01:13:34.512
My socks tend to shrink.

01:13:36.097 --> 01:13:37.515
It's from my girlfriend.

01:13:41.269 --> 01:13:45.358
She said she's not gonna write any more.

01:13:47.943 --> 01:13:50.863
Friends at college told her it's immoral.

01:13:51.864 --> 01:13:53.449
To write to me.

01:14:58.684 --> 01:15:01.186
Medic Doc! Get your
goddam medic up here.

01:15:04.523 --> 01:15:10.280

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:36.223
C'mon guys let's go

01:15:36.307 --> 01:15:38.059
and break this fucking hill!

01:15:48.904 --> 01:15:50.614
Okay, let's get ready,
let's take this squad.

01:15:50.655 --> 01:15:53.158
Teddy Ford. May 17.

01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:59.247
How long have you been
on this hill, soldier?

01:16:01.333 --> 01:16:02.334
What?

01:16:04.086 --> 01:16:07.214
Hey brother, how many times have you
been up and down this hill?

01:16:07.756 --> 01:16:08.883
What are you doing here?

01:16:08.925 --> 01:16:09.384
It's my job.

01:16:09.509 --> 01:16:10.677
Bullshit.

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:15.098
We've been up and down
this hill... nine fucking times.

01:16:15.098 --> 01:16:17.934
Hey, word down at Division is
you guys can't take this hill.

01:16:17.934 --> 01:16:22.271
What do you have to say about that?
In fact, Senator Kennedy says

01:16:22.397 --> 01:16:24.482
you guys don't have a chance at all.

01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:29.530
You really like this shit, don't you?

01:16:30.531 --> 01:16:32.950
It's your job. A story.

01:16:33.033 --> 01:16:37.371
You're waiting here like a fucking vulture.
Watching for somebody to die, so you can take a picture.

01:16:37.496 --> 01:16:38.080
It's my job.

01:16:38.205 --> 01:16:40.791
I've got more respect for those little bastards up there.
At least they take a side.

01:16:41.458 --> 01:16:44.712
You just take pictures. You probably
don't even do your own fucking.

01:16:45.546 --> 01:16:46.630
No one ask my AO.

01:16:46.714 --> 01:16:47.548
What?

01:16:47.631 --> 01:16:49.133
You listen to me.

01:16:50.885 --> 01:16:53.471
We're gonna take this
fucking hill, Newsman.

01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:57.809
I see you on the top taking
pictures of any of my people

01:16:57.851 --> 01:17:00.437
I will blow your fucking head off.

01:17:01.396 --> 01:17:04.107
Now you haven't earned
the right to be here.

01:17:05.567 --> 01:17:07.152
Do you understand that?

01:17:09.821 --> 01:17:11.490
Understand that.

01:17:27.339 --> 01:17:29.508
I should have gone to Canada.

01:17:29.592 --> 01:17:31.845
All they got is Eskimo's up there,
Beenie.

01:17:32.429 --> 01:17:34.514
The smart white people go to college.

01:17:34.681 --> 01:17:39.436
Not me. I'm going my two years, getting married.
And forgetting all about this shit.

01:17:39.561 --> 01:17:40.270
Never happened.

01:17:42.356 --> 01:17:44.191
You people must be aware...

01:17:44.232 --> 01:17:49.613
that the brothers... are here. Because
they cannot afford an education.

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:52.575
What am I doing?

01:17:52.575 --> 01:17:57.622
Sitting in some... fucking country club
sipping on seven and sevens...
and eating a steak.

01:17:58.873 --> 01:18:01.709
Take a look around I see
all kinds of white faces here.

01:18:02.794 --> 01:18:07.298
Okay. The war Started for you...

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:09.801
when you farted...

01:18:10.385 --> 01:18:13.639
and said good morning Vietnam.

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:17.309
See now I was born into this shit.

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:20.771
And they pulled the gold fucking spoon...
out of mouth so I could come here.

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:24.400
And see how you low Class
eleven boos live. Is that it?

01:18:53.597 --> 01:18:55.725
Brother Blood.

01:19:03.774 --> 01:19:05.276
Hey, how'd you get here, Sarge?

01:19:05.359 --> 01:19:08.696
Oh, the Sarge... the Sarge
volunteered for this shit.

01:19:10.322 --> 01:19:11.615
No, man.

01:19:11.615 --> 01:19:16.496
I was drafted, sworn in... and had
my haircut before I was sober.

01:19:17.456 --> 01:19:19.958
The only reason I went
airborne is Collins.

01:19:20.167 --> 01:19:21.376
Who the fuck is Collins?

01:19:24.463 --> 01:19:27.132
We volunteered for the reality of it.

01:19:31.887 --> 01:19:35.266
Don't you think I chased woman and good time... before
I got into the green machine.

01:19:41.022 --> 01:19:47.779
We got our orders from the big puddle.
Collins says... he's not going.

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:50.073
And this one strac.
/You got to respect that.

01:19:51.908 --> 01:19:53.409
No way.

01:19:53.493 --> 01:19:56.914
If you don't want to pull
on the little people. No sweat.

01:19:57.498 --> 01:20:04.254
Don't use your weapon. All I want from
anybody is... to get their ass in the
grass with the rest of us.

01:20:05.547 --> 01:20:09.176
You don't have to like it.
But you have to show up.

01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:16.851
No FNG's, no war.

01:20:23.233 --> 01:20:24.359
There it is.

01:20:46.882 --> 01:20:47.758
Medic!

01:20:47.883 --> 01:20:51.554
Doc... no! Doc!

01:21:06.069 --> 01:21:08.238
Hey you motherfuckers!

01:21:23.004 --> 01:21:25.089
Baletsky! Doc's hit!

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.341

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:29.343
Baletsky! Gettim he's hit!

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:34.432
Diggs! Diggs!

01:21:36.435 --> 01:21:39.938
Doc, he's dead! He's dead!

01:21:40.022 --> 01:21:40.773
O!

01:21:40.898 --> 01:21:46.612
Stay with me! Stay with me!
Stay with me!

01:21:47.446 --> 01:22:01.544
Gaigin, stay with me,

01:22:18.479 --> 01:22:19.647
C'mon on move!

01:22:26.153 --> 01:22:27.488
Keep going!

01:23:04.402 --> 01:23:06.195
Ain't get up!!!

01:24:32.035 --> 01:24:34.079
All right, let's you straight.

01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:37.124
You've got a good one man.

01:24:38.542 --> 01:24:40.127
You're going home.

01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:41.879
See...

01:24:42.922 --> 01:24:44.465
See you at home.

01:24:49.971 --> 01:24:56.227
He's all right blood. I don't feel
a thing. I am boo koo doped up.

01:25:00.231 --> 01:25:04.903
Now, come on now. You owe
this to yourself, all right?

01:25:05.571 --> 01:25:11.577
Black Jack... won't be happy... 'til
he gets all my people... killed.

01:25:11.618 --> 01:25:14.163
Hey, how are you going to actman, how are you going to act?
You're going back to the real world.

01:25:14.204 --> 01:25:15.914
Going back, Doc.

01:25:16.999 --> 01:25:22.255
I'm just what the world needs.
Another nigger with a limp.

01:25:22.338 --> 01:25:24.507
Now come on, you stop that shit.

01:25:25.675 --> 01:25:28.261
I'm not omitting you, blood.

01:25:29.304 --> 01:25:35.685
We're all no good...
dumb niggers on this hill.

01:25:35.769 --> 01:25:40.523
Blood. And soul. Types.

01:25:43.402 --> 01:25:46.113
But we are going to fool
them this time, aren't we?

01:25:46.197 --> 01:25:48.783
Fucking A man. Fucking A.

01:25:48.866 --> 01:25:53.704
We've been up that hill... ten times...

01:25:54.372 --> 01:25:57.208
and they still don't think we're serious.

01:25:59.710 --> 01:26:00.878
Who are we?

01:26:00.878 --> 01:26:02.171
Hey Doc, come on.

01:26:02.213 --> 01:26:03.757
Come on.

01:26:05.050 --> 01:26:06.385
Who are we?

01:26:06.468 --> 01:26:07.219
A hundred and first.

01:26:07.302 --> 01:26:08.887
Screaming Eagles, man.

01:26:11.890 --> 01:26:13.642
Fucking buzzards.

01:26:15.894 --> 01:26:18.146
Take the hill.

01:26:18.647 --> 01:26:23.152
And those bastards back in the world...
can never take that from me.

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.326
Hold on man.

01:26:32.412 --> 01:26:38.501
Hold on man. Now you hold on
there, Doc. Hold on now.

01:27:28.179 --> 01:27:29.764
Save some for the old man.

01:27:30.473 --> 01:27:33.809
Sir, want a cup of coffee?

01:27:49.993 --> 01:27:53.163
Black Jack wants us to
manuever aggressively.

01:27:56.875 --> 01:28:00.087
I told him most of first
platoon was still on the hill.

01:28:04.758 --> 01:28:06.803
We're not going anywhere, Sergeant.

01:28:06.928 --> 01:28:08.179
Drink your coffee.

01:28:13.351 --> 01:28:15.103
Why did you keep coming back?

01:28:18.106 --> 01:28:21.526
Ask me that when we're
back in the world

01:28:21.526 --> 01:28:24.028
Drinking cold beer and
chasing hot women.

01:28:30.702 --> 01:28:34.206
I think, when I get back,
I'm never leaving it again.

01:28:35.290 --> 01:28:39.461
Flushing toilets, hot showers, pizza.

01:28:41.964 --> 01:28:44.216
I want a corn dog with mustard.

01:28:47.429 --> 01:28:49.723
I want some of that free
love that I'm hearing about.

01:28:49.806 --> 01:28:51.474
I'm always hearing about that.

01:28:52.892 --> 01:28:54.144
It's overrated.

01:28:55.562 --> 01:28:58.398
But your right about them loving
everybody back there, sir.

01:28:59.149 --> 01:29:04.904

they wear love buttons, on their
flowered shirts, you know.

Yeah, they love everybody back there.

01:29:13.998 --> 01:29:24.341
Cats, dogs, niggers, spicks,

They love everybody but you.

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:47.950
I was medevaced after Dak To.

01:29:50.369 --> 01:29:52.121
That was a hill.

01:29:53.206 --> 01:29:59.212

And they had bags full of dump shits.

01:30:17.481 --> 01:30:18.899

Sorry about that I said.

01:30:40.588 --> 01:30:42.507

A go down to the polly's for beers,
old man was drinking shooters.

01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:53.185
