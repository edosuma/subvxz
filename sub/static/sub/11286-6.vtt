Oh, good.

Gah! Come on, Khadijah,
it's a beautiful day.

00:09.966 --> 00:12.533
Put that stuff aside,
let's go for a run!

00:12.600 --> 00:14.833
Please, look at
these bills. I can't.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.833
Thank God!

[shivers]

00:28.066 --> 00:30.166
These are yours.
They were in my box.

00:30.233 --> 00:33.666
Yes, right next to your
Coco's singles newsletter.

00:35.900 --> 00:38.000
Damn, another
30‐day notice!

00:38.066 --> 00:39.533
Just look
on the bright side.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.466
Means you have another 29 days
of free electricity.

00:42.533 --> 00:45.166
I thought you always paid
your bills on time.

00:45.233 --> 00:46.966
I do when I
have the money.

00:47.033 --> 00:48.766
But things have been
so tight lately

00:48.833 --> 00:50.566
I'm thinkin' about
auctionin' off a kidney.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.900
Trust me, there's
no money in organs.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.266
You know, Kyle, you work
with money everyday

00:57.333 --> 00:59.466
maybe you can help
straighten out my finances.

00:59.533 --> 01:02.473
No. No. Nope, sorry,
I do not work for friends.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.605
Well, don't think
of me as a friend.

01:04.673 --> 01:07.673
Think of me as someone who
fed you dinner every other day

01:07.740 --> 01:08.939
for the past three years.

01:09.006 --> 01:11.473
Okay, fine, I'll help.

01:11.540 --> 01:14.006
But be warned.
I'm tough.

01:14.073 --> 01:16.573
I'm gonna force you
to live on a strict budget.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.540
And you can start by cuttin' out
unnecessary household expenses.

01:19.606 --> 01:22.406
Ergo...stop feeding that.

I read the whole

the grease trap open

this'll have to do.

Synclaire, I thought
you were at the library.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.486
They kicked me out for
staying past closing time.

to get a life.

in the class.

‐ Hello.
‐ How you doin'?

05:26.400 --> 05:28.366
So, Overton, are you
an art buff, too?

05:28.433 --> 05:30.666
Oh, no, he is not
interested in this stuff.

05:30.733 --> 05:32.000
‐ 'Oh.'
‐ Not true.

as much as the next man.

Oh, you..

05:42.200 --> 05:43.800

that Franz Kline

05:43.866 --> 05:46.100
actually used house paint
in some of his work.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.700
'Cause he liked the texture.

05:47.766 --> 05:49.766
Well, if he was really
interested in texture

05:49.833 --> 05:52.766
I believe stucco would've
been the way to go.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.866

you're such a hoot!

05:56.933 --> 05:59.066

‐ Oh, yeah, yeah!

Synclaire?

06:01.106 --> 06:03.840

to spend time with my baby

06:03.906 --> 06:05.740
than to join the class?

06:05.806 --> 06:07.740
Yeah, what better way?

Congratulations, Khadijah!

06:13.406 --> 06:16.340
By using coupons and buyin'
generic brands, you saved

06:16.406 --> 06:18.540
forty‐five percent
of your last grocery bill.

06:18.606 --> 06:21.573
And also saved money
on grapes, by eatin' them

06:21.640 --> 06:24.106
before I got to the register.

06:24.173 --> 06:27.440
He doesn't even know how much
I saved her on the trail mix.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.906
That's not saving,
that's stealing.

06:32.106 --> 06:34.606
Well, you could save
a lot of money in jail.

06:34.673 --> 06:37.306
Hey, Khadijah,
guess what I‐I..

06:37.373 --> 06:39.306

06:39.373 --> 06:42.706
[scoffing]
Oh, no!

06:42.773 --> 06:44.306
Nothin' for me.
Uh‐uh.

06:44.373 --> 06:45.606
I know
what you're sayin'.

06:45.673 --> 06:48.940
This stuff is so bad, I was
almost tempted not to eat it.

you're tryin' to save money..

06:55.240 --> 06:57.473

paid for them, 30 bucks a piece!

07:16.480 --> 07:19.580
I can't.
It's not in my budget.

07:20.913 --> 07:22.680
I'm proud
of you, Khadijah.

07:22.746 --> 07:25.480
Now, you keep this up,
and next time you can buy

07:25.546 --> 07:27.480
the supermarket brand.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.146
Sad thing is I'm
lookin' forward to that.

07:36.313 --> 07:39.046
I'll give you
$25 a piece for 'em.

07:39.113 --> 07:40.380

that you are tryin'

07:43.080 --> 07:45.680
to buy these tickets
in front of Khadijah!

07:45.746 --> 07:47.680
And shunt me
in the process!

‐ Kyle!
‐ Hey, hey, hey.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.246
These tickets
are in my budget.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.980
I will not be taking
a limo to the concert

07:57.046 --> 07:58.946
because...it's
not in my budget.

07:59.013 --> 08:01.520
I will not be buying
new clothes for the concert

08:01.586 --> 08:03.120
because...it's
not in my budget.

08:03.186 --> 08:04.653
But I suppose you'd be taking

08:04.720 --> 08:07.253
taking some bimbo
to an expensive dinner.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.420
That is an investment.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.553
Don't I have some
luxuries in my budget?

08:16.620 --> 08:20.720
Yeah, but you blew that
on the gumball machine

08:20.786 --> 08:22.720
at the supermarket.

08:24.586 --> 08:25.520
Oh!

08:29.953 --> 08:31.920
Have to admit, Synclaire,
I am pretty nervous

08:31.986 --> 08:34.220
about bein' back in school.

08:34.285 --> 08:36.086
Almost faked a fever.

08:36.153 --> 08:38.753
Then I thought,
hell, who am I foolin'?

08:38.820 --> 08:40.385
You'll be fine.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.953
That's Professor Fletcher.
Come on.

08:46.186 --> 08:48.620
Now, hold up, slick,
I'm with her.

08:50.786 --> 08:52.753
Good evening, art lovers
and those of you

08:52.820 --> 08:54.753
who need the extra credit.

08:54.820 --> 08:57.620
Oh, I see we have a new student
in class tonight.

08:57.686 --> 08:59.286
Tell us a bit about yourself.

08:59.353 --> 09:02.893
Well...name is
Overton Wakefield Jones.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.626
Originally from Cleveland.

09:04.693 --> 09:07.526
I'm an Aquarius.
Synclaire's my girlfriend.

09:07.593 --> 09:09.326
Obie, he doesn't
need to know that.

09:09.393 --> 09:12.493
No, some of the fellas might
want to keep that in mind.

09:16.726 --> 09:19.526
Oh, and I, I believe
the art feeds the soul.

09:19.593 --> 09:22.960
Yeah, I used to
believe that, too.

09:23.026 --> 09:26.293
Last week I told you
to bring in reproductions

09:26.360 --> 09:28.693
of your favorite paintings
for interpretation.

09:28.760 --> 09:32.993
Uh, why don't we start
the class off on a high note.

09:33.060 --> 09:34.226
Synclaire.

09:38.060 --> 09:41.193
This is "The Scream",
by Edward Munch

09:41.260 --> 09:44.493
a German expressionist who
really captured the despair

09:44.560 --> 09:47.160
and isolation
of his generation.

09:47.226 --> 09:49.493
I really relate
to this piece.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.326
Normally,
I'm a chipper gal.

09:52.393 --> 09:54.893
But sometimes, I feel that
everything out in the world

09:54.960 --> 09:56.893
is a hostile force
to get me.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.960
They had to get
past me first, baby.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.866
Yes, ah, anyway

10:02.933 --> 10:05.500
the composition,
the rhythm of this piece

10:05.566 --> 10:07.200
really speak to me.

10:07.266 --> 10:08.666
Very good, Synclaire!

10:08.733 --> 10:11.166
Reminds me of "Home Alone".

10:13.100 --> 10:15.800
Since you've brought yourself
to our attention, Overton

10:15.866 --> 10:18.266
why don't you go next?

10:18.333 --> 10:22.033
Well...I just went
with my heart.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.033
"Dogs Playing Poker".

10:26.100 --> 10:28.133
See, if dogs could play poker

10:28.200 --> 10:30.366
this is exactly
what they'd look like.

10:30.433 --> 10:32.666
And I really loved the way
the artist captured

10:32.733 --> 10:35.033
the tight‐lipped expression
of the bulldog

10:35.100 --> 10:37.033
who's obviously bluffin'.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.966
Obie, Obie,
that's not real art.

10:41.033 --> 10:43.300
But it is based
on a fine work.

10:43.366 --> 10:46.166
‐ "The Card Players".
‐ By Paul Cezanne.

10:46.233 --> 10:49.766
‐ I looked it up.
‐ Oh, nice job, Overton!

10:49.833 --> 10:51.766
'Now, who'd like to go next?'

10:52.933 --> 10:56.600
‐ Aaron.
‐ Uh..

10:56.666 --> 10:58.033
[clears throat]

10:58.100 --> 11:00.973
I brought in
Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa".

11:01.040 --> 11:03.373
Which is, in my opinion,
the greatest painting

11:03.440 --> 11:04.573
in all the world.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.573
A masterpiece of portraiture.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.573
That's also the most
reproduced work in history.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.373
I know. I forgot
about the assignment.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.673
Went to a card shop
down on the corner.

11:15.740 --> 11:17.306
They had
a million of these!

11:17.373 --> 11:20.406
Also, I got
the "Mona Lisa" t‐shirt..

11:20.473 --> 11:23.473
...uh, the travel umbrella,
and a shower curtain.

11:23.540 --> 11:26.040
The man says when you walk
around in the bathroom

11:26.106 --> 11:28.040
the eyes follow you.

11:30.140 --> 11:32.440
Can anyone save
the drowning Aaron?

11:32.506 --> 11:35.240
Well, I believe that
the "Mona Lisa" is a great work

11:35.306 --> 11:37.973
because of da Vinci's dramatic
use of light and shadow.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.373
[grunts]

11:40.440 --> 11:43.506
Overton, you obviously
have some opinion on this.

11:43.573 --> 11:48.140
Well, personally,
I don't get the hype.

11:48.206 --> 11:51.640
I mean is it me,
or is this smile crooked?

11:51.706 --> 11:53.506
And the background,
I'm guessin'

11:53.573 --> 11:55.206
these are supposed
to be mountains

11:55.273 --> 11:56.673
but you can't really tell.

11:56.740 --> 11:58.673
It just doesn't
look finished to me.

12:00.913 --> 12:02.413
Overton is
absolutely right.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.746
In fact, da Vinci never
finished the "Mona Lisa".

12:04.813 --> 12:06.446
Wasn't even his
favorite painting.

12:06.513 --> 12:07.913
Well, what do you know?

12:07.980 --> 12:09.913
Take note, people,
Overton is not afraid

12:09.980 --> 12:11.513
to challenge
conventional wisdom.

12:11.580 --> 12:12.913
I say, bravo!

12:12.980 --> 12:15.646
And I encourage all of you
to twist your minds

12:15.713 --> 12:17.646
the way Overton
has twisted his.

12:29.859 --> 12:31.793
I'm mad as H!

12:34.026 --> 12:36.459
Ooh, she said the H letter!

12:37.626 --> 12:39.893
Did I hear Synclaire
almost cuss?

12:41.393 --> 12:44.359
Overton worked my last
nerve in class today.

12:44.426 --> 12:46.659
He had to sit next to me.

12:46.726 --> 12:48.959
Had to let everyone know
I was his girlfriend.

12:49.026 --> 12:52.326
And if that's not bad enough,
he had to be the teacher's pet.

12:52.393 --> 12:54.426
Suck up!

12:54.493 --> 12:56.993
Hey, I have never seen you
this mad at him.

12:57.059 --> 12:58.959
Truth is, I'm mad at myself

12:59.026 --> 13:02.033
I let him join that class,
knowing it wasn't a good idea.

13:02.099 --> 13:03.833
I know exactly what
you're goin' through.

13:03.899 --> 13:06.733
In college, my boyfriend and I
were in the same class.

13:06.799 --> 13:09.233
And it was a real drag.

13:09.299 --> 13:10.666
What did you do?

13:10.733 --> 13:14.166
He gave me a failing grade
on my midterm, so I dumped him.

13:17.366 --> 13:19.599
Synclaire, you need to
be straight up with Overton

13:19.666 --> 13:21.399
ask him to leave the class.

13:21.466 --> 13:24.766
I don't wanna be petty.
I just want him to go away.

13:24.833 --> 13:27.133
Synclaire, honey,
you've got to handle

13:27.199 --> 13:30.166
the fragile male ego
with kid gloves.

13:30.233 --> 13:33.833
Sweetie, I say throw a brick
through his window.

13:36.799 --> 13:39.299
Oh, no no!

13:39.366 --> 13:41.199
I'm probably making
too much of this.

13:41.266 --> 13:43.499
The smart thing to do
is just for me

13:43.566 --> 13:46.599
to ignore all
of my deepest feelings.

13:46.666 --> 13:47.966
Okay.

13:48.033 --> 13:50.266
But, um, you let me know
when you're ready

13:50.333 --> 13:52.266
to do that brick thing.

13:54.199 --> 13:56.666
Hey, Synclaire, study time.

13:56.733 --> 13:58.966
Now, I took the liberty
of highlighting your book.

13:59.033 --> 14:02.273
And dog‐earing all
the appropriate pictures.

14:02.339 --> 14:05.273
Give me my book,
you freakin' barnacle!

14:08.639 --> 14:10.573
Did I say that out loud?

14:11.906 --> 14:15.106
Um, something
wrong, Synclaire?

14:15.173 --> 14:17.073
Is it too late
to say no?

14:17.139 --> 14:19.673
Hell, yeah!

14:19.739 --> 14:22.839
Ooh, watch yourself.
He went for the whole H word.

14:24.206 --> 14:27.473
Would you two get out of here?
Overton and I need to talk.

14:27.539 --> 14:29.973
Sure, get
a back bone now.

14:32.073 --> 14:34.173
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, watch this.

14:35.606 --> 14:36.539
[Regine screams]

14:42.039 --> 14:44.006
I didn't mean
to snap like that.

14:44.073 --> 14:46.006
To be honest with you

14:46.073 --> 14:48.806
I was really enjoyin'
that class until you enrolled.

14:48.873 --> 14:50.939
Then why'd you tell me
I could join?

14:51.006 --> 14:52.606
I was just being polite.

14:52.673 --> 14:57.073
Well, maybe if you had to
have been ruder to me then

14:57.139 --> 14:59.073
you'd be nicer to me now.

15:00.846 --> 15:02.713
Talk about rude.

15:02.779 --> 15:04.279
You just waltzed
into that class

15:04.346 --> 15:06.579
and turned it into
the Overton Show.

15:06.646 --> 15:07.846
Staring Overton

15:07.913 --> 15:10.513
with his trusty sidekick,
Professor Fletcher.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.446
Oh, I see.

15:14.513 --> 15:17.013
So, you intimidated by
the fact that Overton is not

15:17.079 --> 15:19.713
just a simple handyman
any more, huh?

15:19.779 --> 15:23.546
That's right.
Just a big old wind bag!

15:25.313 --> 15:28.413
Well, um, I got a little
news flash for you, girlie.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.113
I like that class.

15:32.179 --> 15:34.213
And I'm good in that class.

15:34.279 --> 15:37.046
And I'm stayin'
in...that class.

15:52.213 --> 15:54.146
God, I miss him so!

16:00.286 --> 16:02.386
Hey, Overton.
Where's Synclaire?

16:03.686 --> 16:06.419
Don't know,
and don't care.

16:06.486 --> 16:08.819
Well, art mavens..

16:08.886 --> 16:10.253
...I finished grading
your quizzes

16:10.319 --> 16:13.319
and I'm pleased to report that
at least half of you understood

16:13.386 --> 16:15.219
what I've been talking about.

16:15.286 --> 16:17.853
As for the rest of you,
it's only night school.

16:17.919 --> 16:20.753
Who really cares?

16:20.819 --> 16:22.219
Once again, Synclaire James

16:22.286 --> 16:24.253
had one of the most
insightful essays

16:24.319 --> 16:27.086
and with her permission
I'd like to read a portion.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.286
Synclaire.

16:29.353 --> 16:30.786
Um, Miss James?

16:30.853 --> 16:32.786
Um, she'll be here.

16:35.186 --> 16:37.119
No she won't.

16:38.586 --> 16:40.519
I chased her away.

16:42.386 --> 16:44.686
I grieve that I asked.

16:44.753 --> 16:47.553
I grieve, too.

16:47.619 --> 16:51.786
See my, my beautiful Synclaire
was like this Venus here.

16:51.853 --> 16:54.819
And I'm like the clamp shell
she's standin' on.

16:54.886 --> 16:58.986
Only, instead of holdin' her up,
I just...slam shut on her.

17:00.859 --> 17:04.459
I just like to say, if we can
all learn to relate art

17:04.526 --> 17:07.358
to our personal lives,
the way Overton has

17:07.425 --> 17:09.326
I'm sure we'd be
just as embarrassed

17:09.393 --> 17:12.326
for ourselves,
as we are for him.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.526
Oh, freedom!

17:21.593 --> 17:24.526
Yeah, I'll see you.
I'll see you.

17:26.093 --> 17:28.026
New releases.

17:29.793 --> 17:31.726
Microwave popping corn!

17:35.193 --> 17:37.559
Oh, yes,
we're gonna pop you.

17:37.626 --> 17:39.859
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am gonna pop you.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.459
I'm gonna pop you.

17:42.526 --> 17:44.459
[humming]

17:56.126 --> 17:59.059
For shame!
For shame, Khadijah!

18:02.533 --> 18:04.566
It's not how it looks.

18:04.633 --> 18:07.833
Uh‐huh?
What's in the microwave?

18:07.899 --> 18:09.899
Generic budget dinner.

18:09.966 --> 18:11.899
[popping]

18:15.066 --> 18:17.033
You're pathetic,
you know that?

18:17.099 --> 18:19.699
Did you drop something
on the way to the market?

18:19.766 --> 18:20.699
My shopping list.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.733
‐ Excuse me?
‐ My shopping list.

18:22.799 --> 18:24.666
Replete with brand names
and extravagances.

18:24.733 --> 18:28.933
Look at this, mineral water,
air freshener, pre‐cut salad.

18:28.999 --> 18:30.966
Why don't you just
spit in my face?

18:31.033 --> 18:32.166
It'll never happen again.

18:32.233 --> 18:34.866
[scoffs]

18:34.933 --> 18:37.766
You know what your problem is?
You can't commit.

18:37.833 --> 18:39.733
Khadija, I'm afraid
I can no longer

18:39.799 --> 18:41.233
be your
financial advisor.

18:41.299 --> 18:43.233
No, I need you!

18:44.766 --> 18:46.966
You can't be trusted.
No. No, look..

18:47.033 --> 18:48.333
‐ Please.
‐ No.

18:48.399 --> 18:50.999
I say we end this now.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.773
Okay, Kyle,
maybe you're right.

19:02.539 --> 19:05.639
But if I need you, can I
call you for some advice?

19:08.606 --> 19:10.573
Just give me
some time, Khadija.

19:15.506 --> 19:16.439
[sighs]

19:19.006 --> 19:20.973
Aren't you supposed
to be in class?

19:21.039 --> 19:23.073
Yes, but I knew Overton
would be there

19:23.139 --> 19:24.439
so I wandered around

19:24.506 --> 19:27.139
I...had a conversation
with a woman on a bench.

19:27.206 --> 19:29.473
I...realized she was
talking to herself.

19:32.139 --> 19:33.706
Hey, everyone.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.106
‐ Synclaire.
‐ Overton.

19:36.173 --> 19:39.473
Uh, let's get outta here.

19:39.539 --> 19:42.339
I got some movies.
They're already paid for.

19:42.406 --> 19:43.839
Oh, you're a cheap date!

19:43.906 --> 19:46.339
You know, I mean that
as a compliment.

19:48.606 --> 19:51.939
So, um...
where were you tonight?

19:52.006 --> 19:53.973
I just thought
it'd be better for us

19:54.039 --> 19:55.773
if I stopped goin' to class.

19:55.839 --> 19:58.173
Come on, girl, you know
you love that class.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.013
Besides, the only reason
I signed up

20:00.079 --> 20:02.079
was so we could spend
more time together.

20:02.146 --> 20:04.079
That's sweet, Overton.

20:04.146 --> 20:07.813
But I realize that I also need
a place that's just for me.

20:07.879 --> 20:11.346
You see, at work,
it's always about Khadijah.

20:11.413 --> 20:15.079
And at home, it's always
about Khadijah and Regine

20:15.146 --> 20:17.479
and Maxine and Kyle
and you, then me.

20:17.546 --> 20:20.379
I'm like Eve Tange
in the surrealist movement.

20:20.446 --> 20:23.613
‐ Who?
‐ Exactly!

20:23.679 --> 20:26.413
I'm overshadowed the way
he was by Salvador Dali.

20:26.479 --> 20:30.313
‐ Who?
‐ Oh, it doesn't matter.

20:30.379 --> 20:34.313
Yeah, well, you do deserve
a place that is special to you.

20:34.379 --> 20:36.779
I mean, hey, I got
that in the basement.

20:36.846 --> 20:40.279
So...I'm gonna drop the class.

20:41.579 --> 20:44.613
‐ Are you sure?
‐ Positive.

20:44.679 --> 20:46.713
Oh, thank you, Obie!

20:46.779 --> 20:51.213
So is the academic career
of Overtone Wakefield Jones.

20:51.279 --> 20:52.813
I'm gonna miss it.

20:52.879 --> 20:55.113
Well, why don't you
just take another course?

20:55.179 --> 20:57.113
Hmm, it's a good idea.

20:57.179 --> 20:58.913
Maybe I could take
the architecture class

20:58.979 --> 21:00.019
across the hall.

21:00.086 --> 21:01.853
You know,
buildings speak to me

21:01.919 --> 21:04.753
the same way that
screamin' dude speaks to you.

21:04.819 --> 21:07.586
Obie, I'm so sorry
we had a fight over this.

21:07.653 --> 21:10.586
Yeah, me too. But you
know what fightin' means?

21:10.653 --> 21:12.586
Makin' up, baby.

21:16.819 --> 21:18.953
It was a really big fight.

21:24.586 --> 21:27.486
You know what?
It was bigger than that.

21:38.053 --> 21:40.986
[theme music]

21:44.753 --> 21:47.686
[theme music]

22:08.626 --> 22:10.926
‐ All finished.
‐ Thank you.

22:10.993 --> 22:12.926
(Khadijah)
Let's see here.

22:17.626 --> 22:21.659
Baby when you die, that's
gonna be worth something.
