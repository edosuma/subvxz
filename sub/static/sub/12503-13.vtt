Previously on <i>Life UneXpected...</i>

00:01.251 --> 00:03.752
<i>When you and I broke up,</i>

00:03.787 --> 00:06.555
Julia and I slept together.

00:06.589 --> 00:08.157
<i>Eric.</i>

00:08.191 --> 00:09.124
I told Math...

00:09.159 --> 00:10.726
about us... about...

00:10.760 --> 00:13.195
You kidding me?!
You're supposed to

00:13.229 --> 00:14.263
be her teacher!

00:14.297 --> 00:16.465
Not some sicko
who takes advantage

00:16.499 --> 00:18.867
of a kid who wouldn't know
a healthy relationship

00:18.902 --> 00:21.103
if she was sitting next to it in study hall!
You don't know anything

00:21.104 --> 00:23.105
about your own relationship,
either

00:23.139 --> 00:24.373
- Enlighten me.
- Emma?!

00:24.407 --> 00:26.642
She had an affair with your dad.

00:26.676 --> 00:28.510
<i>Here's what's going to happen.</i>

00:28.545 --> 00:30.546
You're going to pack your bags,
and you are going

00:30.580 --> 00:31.980
to leave town, immediately.

00:32.015 --> 00:34.016
And if you ever
make contact with

00:34.050 --> 00:36.351
our daughter again,
we go to the police.

00:36.386 --> 00:37.786
I understand.

00:37.821 --> 00:39.121
Were you going to tell me?

00:39.155 --> 00:41.356
I knew if I did,

00:41.391 --> 00:42.691
I would lose you.

00:42.726 --> 00:45.327
You just did.

00:56.206 --> 00:58.640
Hey, babe, we gotta go.
We're gonna be late for work.

00:58.675 --> 01:00.242
I know, I know, I... Wait.

01:00.276 --> 01:01.977
Where's my purse?
My purse. My purse is gone.

01:02.011 --> 01:03.145
Oh, hey. Don't forget,
we got that

01:03.179 --> 01:04.413
appointment with
Dr. Sheriden today.

01:04.447 --> 01:06.515
I swear, this
no-caffeine thing is

01:06.549 --> 01:08.317
the worst part
about being pregnant.

01:08.351 --> 01:09.485
I thought you said
the weight gain

01:09.519 --> 01:10.586
was the worst part.

01:10.620 --> 01:11.787
That was the lack
of caffeine talking.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.722
Hey, get out of here.
Did you remember to

01:13.757 --> 01:15.424
wake Lux?
Lux!

01:15.458 --> 01:16.492
Lux!

01:16.526 --> 01:17.760
Okay!

01:17.794 --> 01:18.861
Oh, good. You're up.

01:18.895 --> 01:20.395
Okay, Baze is coming
early for your

01:20.430 --> 01:21.864
last driving lesson.

01:21.898 --> 01:23.332
I'm not going driving,
and I'm not going to school.

01:23.366 --> 01:24.633
I think I have a fever.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.235
I got it.

01:26.269 --> 01:27.636
Okay.
You know what?

01:27.670 --> 01:29.271
Look, my hand!

01:29.305 --> 01:30.906
It's hotter than
your head. I think

01:30.940 --> 01:32.541
you're okay.
Because you just assume

01:32.575 --> 01:33.575
I'm lying.
Well, you spent

01:33.610 --> 01:34.610
months sneaking
around with a guy

01:34.644 --> 01:35.577
seven years
older than you,

01:35.612 --> 01:36.879
so I am not
exactly assuming.

01:36.913 --> 01:38.914
He's not just a guy.

01:38.948 --> 01:40.015
Eric loved me.
And you

01:40.049 --> 01:41.083
and Baze,
you ruined everything.

01:41.117 --> 01:42.551
Okay, that was
not love, Lux.

01:42.585 --> 01:43.919
That was wrong.

01:43.953 --> 01:45.454
Oh...
Wrong like

01:45.488 --> 01:46.555
having sex with

01:46.589 --> 01:47.489
your ex and not telling

01:47.524 --> 01:49.558
the guy you were
engaged to? Or...

01:49.592 --> 01:50.759
wrong like pretending
you were trying

01:50.794 --> 01:51.894
to get pregnant
and then taking the pill

01:51.928 --> 01:53.829
behind your husband's back?
Cate.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.299
You're going to love this.

01:58.935 --> 02:00.202
Kelly's been fired.

02:00.236 --> 02:02.538
Turns out,
our audience finds her

02:02.539 --> 02:04.381
uptight, cold and grating.

02:04.481 --> 02:05.087
You know, if only

02:05.159 --> 02:06.159
someone had predicted that.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.560
The good
news is,

02:07.595 --> 02:08.561
your numbers are

02:08.596 --> 02:09.729
as high as they've ever been.

02:09.764 --> 02:11.998
The audience
loves you...

02:12.033 --> 02:13.366
which is why

02:13.401 --> 02:15.168
we want to offer
you your own show.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.536
Wow.
What?

02:17.505 --> 02:18.972
Why can't we just,
you know,

02:19.006 --> 02:21.007
go back to...
You and Ryan?

02:21.942 --> 02:22.942
No.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.311
The reason I pulled

02:24.345 --> 02:25.712
Cate and Ryan
is because when

02:25.746 --> 02:27.447
boring married people
are driving to work,

02:27.481 --> 02:29.582
they don't want to listen to
other boring married people.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.319
Corporate's allowing us
two weeks to come up with

02:32.353 --> 02:34.821
a brand-new show,
featuring Ryan as a solo act.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.523
We-we have to come up
with a whole new show

02:36.557 --> 02:37.957
in-in two weeks?

02:37.992 --> 02:39.693
And then the real work begins.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.161
Especially for you.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.362
This isn't like last time,

02:42.396 --> 02:43.930
producing a show
that's just being re-branded.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.265
You're going to have to

02:45.299 --> 02:47.067
eat, sleep and breathe Ryan for

02:47.101 --> 02:48.435
the next year of your life.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.969
Consider this show...

02:50.004 --> 02:51.271
your baby.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.273
You don't have anything
that would get

02:53.307 --> 02:54.674
in the way of that, do you?

03:07.355 --> 03:08.988
You, um...

03:10.157 --> 03:11.224
I don't know,
you sure you don't want

03:11.258 --> 03:12.859
to practice a little
parallel parking action

03:12.893 --> 03:15.195
before your test tomorrow?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.668
You're mad at me.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.604
Suit yourself.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.772
So, you knew about

03:25.806 --> 03:27.273
Emma and my dad,

03:27.308 --> 03:29.843
and y-y-you didn't say a word.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.844
Well, you know what?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.045
At least you told me

03:32.079 --> 03:32.578
before I bought the house.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.746
And by told," I mean that you

03:34.780 --> 03:36.715
threw it in my face to hurt me.

03:55.801 --> 03:56.935
Meet me in the bar.

03:56.969 --> 03:59.771
We need to talk.

04:01.707 --> 04:04.442
Hey!

04:04.477 --> 04:06.878
What's so urgent
we couldn't talk at work?

04:08.314 --> 04:10.148
I know, Dad.

04:10.182 --> 04:11.383
Huh?

04:12.318 --> 04:14.753
About you and Emma.

04:18.423 --> 04:19.858
Who told you?

04:19.892 --> 04:21.326
"Who told you?"

04:21.360 --> 04:22.594
That's, that's the first thing
you're going to say?

04:22.628 --> 04:24.696
You know who
didn't tell me?

04:24.730 --> 04:26.331
You.

04:26.365 --> 04:28.366
Or Emma.

04:28.367 --> 04:31.002
Look, I-I told you not
to get involved with her

04:31.037 --> 04:32.537
Because it was office policy,

04:32.572 --> 04:33.905
not because I was
sleeping with someone

04:33.940 --> 04:35.574
that you had an affair with.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.579
Does Mom know?

04:45.718 --> 04:46.985
Did you love her?

04:47.019 --> 04:48.520
Emma?

04:48.554 --> 04:50.889
Yeah.

04:50.923 --> 04:52.624
And she loved me.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.170
You know what?

05:05.204 --> 05:06.538
If I could quit being your son,

05:06.572 --> 05:07.539
I would, but I can't.

05:07.573 --> 05:09.474
You consider this
my notice.

05:09.508 --> 05:11.710
I'm done with work;
I'm done with you.

05:23.289 --> 05:27.359
Let's see how the little
blueberry's doing.

05:27.393 --> 05:29.561
More like a grape.

05:41.907 --> 05:44.476
What's going on?

05:46.612 --> 05:47.879
Why don't you get dressed

05:47.913 --> 05:49.381
and both join me in my office?

05:49.415 --> 05:51.082
What... Wait... What's wrong?

05:51.117 --> 05:53.318
I-I mean, if something's wrong,
you can just tell us.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.353
There's no easy
way to say this.

05:55.388 --> 05:57.022
I wasn't able to
find a heartbeat.

05:57.056 --> 05:58.590
The pregnancy
isn't progressing.

05:58.624 --> 06:00.692
What does that mean?

06:01.661 --> 06:04.295
I'm so sorry.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.464
You've lost the baby.

06:36.886 --> 06:38.253
It's fine, Ryan,

06:38.287 --> 06:39.721
you know? It-it happens.

06:39.755 --> 06:41.356
Why, I know
it happens,

06:41.390 --> 06:42.390
but it...

06:42.425 --> 06:44.025
it just happened to us.

06:44.994 --> 06:46.728
You know, I can call Trina.

06:46.762 --> 06:48.396
I can tell her that you're not
coming in for a few days.

06:48.431 --> 06:49.831
Look, you need

06:49.865 --> 06:51.066
to relax! Okay?
Just take it

06:51.100 --> 06:52.233
easy on the couch.
You know what?

06:52.268 --> 06:53.368
Call Alice. She
just got back.

06:53.402 --> 06:54.369
Okay, listen.
You heard Trina.

06:54.403 --> 06:56.071
There's just
a ton to do

06:56.105 --> 06:58.773
to get a new show up and running.

06:58.808 --> 07:00.775
You know, but the doctor,

07:00.810 --> 07:01.810
she said that stress

07:01.844 --> 07:02.777
may have caused the...

07:02.812 --> 07:03.912
the miscarriage.
Right. "May have."

07:03.946 --> 07:05.380
And we are not going to
know anything yet

07:05.414 --> 07:07.015
until we get
the results back.

07:07.049 --> 07:08.149
Okay.

07:08.184 --> 07:10.885
But, you know, jumping
back into work and...

07:10.920 --> 07:12.721
and launching a new show...

07:13.956 --> 07:15.557
Trying to get pregnant again,

07:15.591 --> 07:16.725
it might be more
important than...

07:16.759 --> 07:18.393
killing yourself over a job

07:18.427 --> 07:20.328
that you didn't even really want
in the first place.

07:28.671 --> 07:30.705
Hey, Mom.

07:30.740 --> 07:31.706
Nate! Honey...

07:31.741 --> 07:33.575
Everything is a mess!

07:33.609 --> 07:34.909
Wha... What?

07:34.944 --> 07:37.011
Why? Why?

07:37.046 --> 07:38.413
Can I use your bar?

07:38.447 --> 07:39.748
'Cause I'm already here.

07:39.782 --> 07:40.815
Wait. Wh-What?

07:40.850 --> 07:43.318
Your father's birthday party.

07:45.488 --> 07:47.222
What... What happened

07:47.256 --> 07:48.256
to the restaurant, Mom?

07:48.290 --> 07:49.724
Well, the party mushroomed,

07:49.759 --> 07:51.960
and we won't all fit.
Okay,

07:51.994 --> 07:53.795
well, you know what? The bar,
I mean, it's not even ready yet.

07:53.829 --> 07:55.196
Like I haven't
painted it or anything.

07:55.231 --> 07:56.264
I mean, there's nothing that...

07:56.298 --> 07:58.366
a few hundred twinkle lights
won't fix.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.868
You know, and besides,

07:59.902 --> 08:01.970
this-this place has a
sentimental value

08:02.004 --> 08:03.338
for your father. You know,

08:03.372 --> 08:04.305
I think it was one the first

08:04.340 --> 08:05.673
commercial buildings
he ever bought.

08:05.708 --> 08:07.509
Yeah. I'm, I'm getting
all choked up,

08:07.543 --> 08:08.476
just thinking about it.

08:08.511 --> 08:09.878
Yeah... um,

08:09.912 --> 08:11.913
yeah, he told me
he had to let you go.

08:11.947 --> 08:13.748
Hold on. He said that?

08:13.783 --> 08:15.617
Because he didn't
let me go. I quit.

08:15.651 --> 08:16.951
Honey, I am not

08:16.986 --> 08:18.286
going to get in the middle
of all this.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.721
Whatever is going on

08:19.755 --> 08:20.789
between you and your father,

08:20.823 --> 08:22.023
please...

08:22.057 --> 08:24.092
let it go for today.

08:24.126 --> 08:25.894
It's his birthday...

08:25.928 --> 08:27.128
and you're his son.

08:27.163 --> 08:28.396
Whatever you want, Mom.

08:34.602 --> 08:35.570
No, I'm positive.

08:35.604 --> 08:36.671
Mr. Daniels is gone.

08:36.705 --> 08:37.972
This totally proves it.

08:38.006 --> 08:39.107
He slept with a student.

08:39.140 --> 08:40.808
Hey, Lux!

08:40.842 --> 08:43.111
Lux!

08:43.145 --> 08:44.479
Lux, wait up!

08:44.513 --> 08:45.780
Whoa, Lux!
I...

08:45.815 --> 08:46.848
I'm late for class.

08:46.882 --> 08:47.982
Are you okay?

08:49.819 --> 08:52.353
I'm fine
just, I'm...

08:52.388 --> 08:54.122
I hate being at school

08:54.156 --> 08:55.523
without Tasha.

08:55.558 --> 08:57.292
I guess there's no skyping

08:57.326 --> 08:58.626
in juvie, huh?

08:58.661 --> 08:59.961
Yeah, I haven't...

08:59.995 --> 09:02.730
even been able
to talk her.

09:03.666 --> 09:05.200
Hey.

09:05.234 --> 09:07.502
You want to ditch school
and go see her?

09:07.536 --> 09:09.504
Really?
Yeah.

09:09.538 --> 09:11.172
I miss her, too.

09:14.410 --> 09:15.543
All right.

09:17.713 --> 09:19.948
<i>Oh, my God, Alice!</i>

09:23.652 --> 09:25.353
Oh, Cate,
I'm so glad you called.

09:25.387 --> 09:27.155
I literally just
got back to town.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.392
Thank you so much for
bringing over lunch.

09:31.427 --> 09:33.161
Oh, it's the least
I can do.

09:33.195 --> 09:34.295
The past few months
have been crap,

09:34.330 --> 09:35.530
and I don't want
to feel bad about

09:35.564 --> 09:36.965
drinking all the
wine in your house.

09:36.999 --> 09:37.966
Okay, there's no way

09:38.000 --> 09:39.067
that your past couple of months

09:39.101 --> 09:40.101
have been any worse than mine.

09:40.102 --> 09:41.867
Oh, Cate, I was
living in Fresno

09:42.027 --> 09:43.394
taking care of my mom,

09:43.806 --> 09:45.406
who's evil.
All right...

09:45.441 --> 09:46.474
well, um...

09:46.508 --> 09:48.176
I lost my job.

09:48.210 --> 09:50.078
You replaced me.
Ryan and I,

09:50.112 --> 09:51.813
our marriage has been in shambles.
Jeff filed

09:51.847 --> 09:53.214
for divorce.

09:53.249 --> 09:54.993
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

09:55.506 --> 09:58.126
So, do I win?

10:00.593 --> 10:02.453
I was pregnant and I lost the baby,

10:02.481 --> 10:04.185
which... you know, was the one thing

10:04.285 --> 10:05.565
that holding I and Ryan together.

10:07.515 --> 10:09.255
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

10:10.265 --> 10:11.325
Are you okay?

10:11.325 --> 10:13.945
Not really, but I had two glasses
of wine before you came over,

10:14.285 --> 10:16.525
which is the one nice thing
about not being pregnant.

10:23.195 --> 10:24.275
Oh, and it's my...uh,

10:24.275 --> 10:25.705
it's my doctor with the test results.

10:25.705 --> 10:27.775
- Just one second.
- No, no, fine.

10:28.725 --> 10:29.745
Hello?

10:35.025 --> 10:36.145
Oh my God!

10:38.055 --> 10:41.085
Yes, but no...
that doesn't really make any sense.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.315
Yeah, no.

10:42.965 --> 10:45.295
Yeah, of course!
I have a million questions.

10:46.635 --> 10:48.285
Okay. I'll come in tomorrow.

10:49.015 --> 10:49.915
Thank you.

10:52.495 --> 10:54.635
What? What is it?
What did she say?

10:58.655 --> 11:01.055
She said I'm not gonna
be able to have more kids.

11:20.285 --> 11:23.875
Look, Lux... Tasha told me
about everything that happened.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.205
After homecoming, the shovel, the trial.

11:27.995 --> 11:29.495
And if you want to talk about anything...

11:29.495 --> 11:31.485
That's not what I am upset about.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.305
Okay.

11:42.115 --> 11:43.745
I was dating someone.

11:45.675 --> 11:47.397
Baze and Cate they were really against it

11:47.453 --> 11:49.165
and they made us break up
and...

11:51.691 --> 11:52.858
it just sucks.

11:52.893 --> 11:54.443
'Cause he was, like,
the nicest guy

11:54.477 --> 11:56.061
I've ever dated.

11:56.112 --> 11:58.180
Yeah.

11:58.198 --> 12:01.233
Well, Bug didn't really
set the bar too high.

12:03.019 --> 12:04.686
Sorry.

12:06.489 --> 12:09.408
Hey, tell them to look
on the bright side.

12:09.459 --> 12:12.194
I mean, at least you're not
dating your teacher.

12:13.079 --> 12:14.463
What?

12:14.497 --> 12:15.881
You heard about that, right?

12:15.916 --> 12:17.132
Some sophomore and Mr. Daniels.

12:17.167 --> 12:18.918
I mean,

12:18.969 --> 12:20.169
at least you're not that girl.

12:20.203 --> 12:21.921
How messed up is that?

12:21.972 --> 12:23.973
Pull over.

12:24.007 --> 12:25.040
What? We're not even to Tasha's.

12:25.058 --> 12:27.309
Oh, I want to get out, Jones.
Pull over.

12:29.596 --> 12:30.980
Wait, Lux!

12:36.154 --> 12:38.438
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
<i>Jimmy Drive, the carpet guy,</i>

12:38.473 --> 12:41.024
here wondering
what are you thinking, Portland,

12:41.059 --> 12:43.110
paying full price for carpeting?

12:43.144 --> 12:44.761
Come on down
to our showroom sale

12:44.779 --> 12:46.480
and save yourself
a big chunk of change.

12:46.531 --> 12:47.731
What are you doing here?

12:47.765 --> 12:50.534
Oh, um, you were
in a meeting.

12:50.568 --> 12:53.236
Wh-What happened to
taking a couple days off?

12:53.270 --> 12:56.490
I can't get pregnant.

12:56.574 --> 12:57.741
Cate, you heard Dr. Sheriden.

12:57.775 --> 12:59.209
This happens to tons of women.

12:59.243 --> 13:00.961
No, she called.

13:00.995 --> 13:04.447
She got my test results back,
and I guess I developed

13:04.465 --> 13:06.416
some sort of condition
after I had Lux.

13:06.450 --> 13:09.619
So Lux is just going
to be it for me.

13:09.637 --> 13:12.439
She is it for us.

13:13.457 --> 13:15.458
Ryan, Corporate wants

13:15.476 --> 13:17.561
to get on the
phone right away.

13:17.595 --> 13:19.462
Yeah, I'll, I'll,
I'll call them back.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.515
Go deal
with Corporate.

13:21.566 --> 13:23.150
Cate, I-I really want
to talk about this.

13:23.184 --> 13:26.069
I know, but talking about it
isn't going to change anything.

13:26.104 --> 13:28.488
Nothing will.

13:53.830 --> 13:55.030
So I assume

13:55.081 --> 13:56.447
you won't be giving a toast.

13:56.465 --> 13:58.616
No.

14:02.471 --> 14:03.955
What the hell
is she doing here?

14:03.973 --> 14:06.241
Your mom invited
everyone your dad knows.

14:06.275 --> 14:08.393
I mean, what the hell
am I doing here?

14:10.830 --> 14:14.099
You, uh, may want to
lay off the shots.

14:14.133 --> 14:17.319
You may want to lay off
telling me what to do.

14:19.405 --> 14:20.522
You know what?

14:20.573 --> 14:22.574
All this time

14:22.608 --> 14:24.576
you have been lecturing me

14:24.610 --> 14:26.111
about what a screwup I am,

14:26.145 --> 14:27.311
and you have been hiding this?

14:27.330 --> 14:29.831
Why didn't
you tell me?

14:29.865 --> 14:32.083
When you found out
that I was dating her,

14:32.118 --> 14:33.935
or before, why didn't
you tell me the truth?

14:33.969 --> 14:36.154
Because you wouldn't
have want to know.

14:37.656 --> 14:42.327
The truth is, the only reason
Emma ended up with you,

14:42.361 --> 14:45.347
is because
she couldn't be with me.

14:58.277 --> 15:00.145
What are you doing, Nate?

15:00.179 --> 15:03.064
I'm going to make a toast
after all.

15:08.907 --> 15:09.919
Hi, everybody.

15:09.940 --> 15:12.408
Um, most of you know me.

15:12.443 --> 15:14.861
If you don't,
I'm Nate.

15:14.895 --> 15:16.746
I'm Jack's son.

15:18.065 --> 15:19.449
Nate.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.451
And being Jack's son,

15:21.502 --> 15:24.253
I always wanted to follow
in my father's footsteps.

15:24.288 --> 15:27.573
You know?

15:27.591 --> 15:31.427
I always felt like I had
to live up to the man he was.

15:31.462 --> 15:34.079
To the man I thought he was.

15:34.098 --> 15:36.966
But I discovered
something about my father

15:37.017 --> 15:41.387
recently that...
made me rethink things.

15:41.422 --> 15:43.856
I discovered...

15:47.394 --> 15:48.861
...the truth.

15:51.865 --> 15:53.349
And the truth is...

15:56.537 --> 15:58.771
<i>The truth is...</i>

16:09.233 --> 16:12.135
And the truth is...

16:14.004 --> 16:16.389
...that ultimately it's
less important who he is

16:16.423 --> 16:17.640
than who I am.

16:17.674 --> 16:19.976
I mean, my father--

16:20.010 --> 16:21.677
he didn't follow
in his father's footsteps.

16:21.728 --> 16:23.996
He had to learn
to be his own man.

16:24.031 --> 16:27.600
And I think maybe the point

16:27.634 --> 16:32.104
of having kids is to raise them
up to be themselves, not you.

16:32.138 --> 16:36.809
If you're lucky, they learn
from your mistakes

16:36.827 --> 16:40.163
and turn out better.

16:42.599 --> 16:44.984
Happy birthday, Dad.

16:45.002 --> 16:46.652
Happy birthday, Jack.
Happy birthday, Jack.

16:46.670 --> 16:48.504
Happy birthday, Jack.
Happy birthday, Jack.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.356
Excuse me.

17:07.391 --> 17:09.442
I'm... I'm sorry, I just...

17:09.476 --> 17:10.476
I-I've been waiting, and...

17:10.510 --> 17:12.228
Who are you
here to see?

17:12.279 --> 17:13.311
Natasha Siviac.

17:13.346 --> 17:15.481
I-I really need
to talk to her.

17:18.351 --> 17:19.452
Miss Siviac

17:19.486 --> 17:20.685
had a disciplinary write-up,

17:20.704 --> 17:22.454
and her visiting privileges
have been suspended.

17:22.489 --> 17:24.189
No... no!

17:24.208 --> 17:26.125
Look, can I just have
like five minutes with her?

17:26.159 --> 17:27.742
Please, I just--
I-I really...

17:27.794 --> 17:30.630
She's the only person that I can talk to.
I'm sorry,

17:30.664 --> 17:32.131
but it's not going to happen.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.598
Where have you been, hmm?

17:48.649 --> 17:51.317
I called the school when you
didn't come home, and they said

17:51.351 --> 17:52.768
that you cut half
of your classes.

17:52.819 --> 17:55.469
You know, I-I had no idea
where you were--

17:55.569 --> 17:56.975
I thought maybe Eric came back.
Oh.

17:56.990 --> 18:00.243
No, Cate, don't worry,
you and Baze successfully

18:00.277 --> 18:01.244
drove him away forever.

18:01.278 --> 18:02.561
Okay, you know
what, Lux?

18:02.579 --> 18:04.247
A lot is going on,
and I do not need

18:04.281 --> 18:06.082
to add worrying about
where you are to my list.

18:06.116 --> 18:08.084
I am under so much stress.

18:08.118 --> 18:10.002
Oh, really? Let me...
let me guess.

18:10.037 --> 18:13.122
You, um, you ate some
pot banana bread?

18:13.173 --> 18:14.740
Or no, wait. I know.

18:14.758 --> 18:16.759
You ran out of things to
compulsively baby-proof?

18:16.793 --> 18:19.262
Right? Come on, Cate, what
is what is so stressful

18:19.296 --> 18:21.430
that's going on
in your life?

18:21.465 --> 18:23.349
Never mind.

18:23.383 --> 18:25.434
Oh, what, you're walking away now?
Yeah, because

18:25.469 --> 18:27.603
I don't want to fight with you.
You know what?

18:27.638 --> 18:30.255
All I want is for
you to talk to me,

18:30.274 --> 18:32.725
so I don't have to find out
what is going on with you

18:32.759 --> 18:34.277
from the police showing up
on my doorstep,

18:34.311 --> 18:35.278
or calling the school

18:35.312 --> 18:37.196
to know that you
weren't there all day!

18:37.230 --> 18:39.932
I just want to know the truth.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.100
No, you don't!

18:41.118 --> 18:44.103
Why do you think
that I have been lying?!

18:44.121 --> 18:45.955
I have tried to tell you,

18:45.989 --> 18:47.456
but you don't listen!

18:47.491 --> 18:48.541
I'm...

18:48.575 --> 18:50.910
not... normal.

18:50.944 --> 18:52.945
Yes... you are!
No, it is

18:52.963 --> 18:56.115
not normal that my first kiss
was with a middle-aged man.

18:56.133 --> 18:57.616
It is not normal that

18:57.634 --> 19:00.786
I am 16, and I have
already been proposed to.

19:00.804 --> 19:04.307
It is not normal that I snuck
around with my teacher because,

19:04.341 --> 19:08.811
weirdly enough, he made me feel
more normal than anyone else.

19:08.895 --> 19:10.179
And I tried to warn you

19:10.230 --> 19:12.098
before you adopted me,
and you wouldn't...

19:12.132 --> 19:14.684
you wouldn't listen, and
now you are stuck with me!

19:14.735 --> 19:17.019
No, Lux,
I am <i>not</i> stuck with you.

19:17.070 --> 19:19.021
No, I... and I get it...

19:19.072 --> 19:20.606
No! How can you get it?

19:20.640 --> 19:21.907
Cate, you don't...

19:21.942 --> 19:23.659
know what it's like
to feel so...

19:23.694 --> 19:26.696
broken inside that
no matter what you do,

19:26.747 --> 19:29.665
no matter what
anyone else does, it...

19:29.700 --> 19:32.284
it can't be fixed.

19:35.172 --> 19:37.206
Okay, um...

19:37.257 --> 19:40.426
I'm not... I'm not
gonna try and fix it.

19:40.460 --> 19:43.929
I know that you don't
want to talk to me,

19:43.964 --> 19:47.216
and you don't have to.

19:47.267 --> 19:52.471
But there are so many people in
your life, Lux, that love you.

19:52.505 --> 19:56.692
Okay? So please,
will you just talk to someone?

20:11.238 --> 20:12.989
Nate.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.974
What are you doing here, Emma?

20:17.828 --> 20:20.647
You quit.

20:20.681 --> 20:23.750
And I didn't know
how else to see you.

20:25.469 --> 20:28.972
So, why...
why do you want to see me?

20:29.006 --> 20:31.891
Because we both
know what I was--

20:31.926 --> 20:33.943
some consolation prize.

20:35.346 --> 20:37.497
Is that what he told you?

20:38.499 --> 20:40.466
Oh, I don't know
what's sadder...

20:41.819 --> 20:45.505
...that he said that or that
you actually believed him.

20:48.943 --> 20:52.579
Getting involved with you

20:52.613 --> 20:55.331
wasn't because
of your father...

20:55.719 --> 20:58.020
it was in spite of him.

20:58.939 --> 21:00.890
I wish...

21:00.941 --> 21:04.360
you could see yourself
the way that I see you.

21:04.394 --> 21:07.846
You are not half the man
your father is, Nate.

21:07.864 --> 21:10.032
You are so much more.

21:50.190 --> 21:53.859
I can't.

21:53.893 --> 21:55.194
No, come on.

21:55.228 --> 21:57.029
I can't do this, Emma.

21:57.063 --> 21:58.897
I want to, I do.

21:58.915 --> 22:00.082
I want this.

22:00.116 --> 22:03.085
You have no idea how much
I want this, but...

22:03.119 --> 22:07.339
I'm not mad at Lux
for not telling me.

22:07.374 --> 22:09.708
I'm mad because she did.

22:09.742 --> 22:12.294
I would give anything

22:12.345 --> 22:13.395
to unknow this.

22:13.430 --> 22:14.480
If I could go back

22:14.514 --> 22:16.582
and be like my mom,
happy and oblivious.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.916
Because I would...
I would love

22:17.934 --> 22:19.718
to have a life
with you, Emma.

22:19.752 --> 22:22.087
We can have that.

22:22.105 --> 22:24.790
We can.

22:25.976 --> 22:27.443
We can't.

22:27.477 --> 22:32.314
Because every time I look
at you, I see you with him.

22:35.535 --> 22:37.570
So you gotta go.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.468
Nate...

22:57.790 --> 22:59.174
I love you.

23:00.477 --> 23:04.980
If you love me, then you'll go.

23:25.485 --> 23:28.837
Thanks for meeting
me here.

23:34.160 --> 23:37.096
I'm glad you called.

23:37.130 --> 23:39.298
Even though
I'm the screwed-up girl

23:39.332 --> 23:40.883
that used to date her teacher?

23:40.934 --> 23:45.437
No. Lux, I don't think
you're screwed up.

23:45.472 --> 23:47.556
I always liked you,
remember?

23:47.607 --> 23:49.725
Since the minute
you got to Westmonte.

23:49.776 --> 23:52.511
Yeah...

23:52.529 --> 23:54.196
I liked you, too.

23:56.015 --> 23:59.068
Yeah, but you were with
Bug, and then...

23:59.119 --> 24:01.820
No, it wasn't just about Bug...

24:01.854 --> 24:03.072
or Eric.

24:03.123 --> 24:07.910
It was me.
I didn't think that...

24:07.961 --> 24:09.795
I could be that girl.

24:09.829 --> 24:12.531
The girl who could date...

24:12.549 --> 24:14.550
you.

24:14.584 --> 24:16.085
Why?

24:16.136 --> 24:18.253
I don't know.

24:19.539 --> 24:21.640
You're Abercrombie.

24:22.709 --> 24:24.259
You know,

24:24.311 --> 24:26.061
everything about you
screams normal.

24:27.314 --> 24:30.649
I bet your scream
even screams normal.

24:30.684 --> 24:33.102
That's not true, Lux.

24:33.153 --> 24:34.186
Oh, yeah?

24:34.220 --> 24:36.689
Tell me one
thing about you

24:36.723 --> 24:41.493
that... is not normal.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.700
My mom's bipolar.

24:47.734 --> 24:51.036
Like...

24:51.070 --> 24:55.574
like in-and-out-of-hospitals
bipolar.

24:55.592 --> 24:56.875
And, uh,

24:56.909 --> 25:01.880
sometimes I get afraid that I'll
turn out like her, too.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.217
I'm sorry.

25:05.251 --> 25:07.219
I'm not telling you
to be sorry.

25:07.253 --> 25:08.587
I'm...

25:08.605 --> 25:12.391
I'm just telling you
'cause everyone has stuff

25:12.425 --> 25:14.059
that no one can see.

25:15.979 --> 25:17.813
If you're in high school,

25:17.864 --> 25:23.435
I think the most normal thing
you can feel is not normal.

25:29.442 --> 25:33.712
You gotta know
you're not alone, Lux.

25:40.086 --> 25:42.671
Neither are you.

25:49.962 --> 25:51.063
What are you doing?

25:51.097 --> 25:53.899
A hook shot.
Oh, wow.

26:03.026 --> 26:04.743
Back on the horse, huh?

26:04.778 --> 26:08.747
Yeah, I'm, uh,
I'm self-soothing.

26:12.452 --> 26:17.106
I... I know that I can't
give you what you want.

26:17.739 --> 26:19.957
And I don't want
you to be with me

26:19.981 --> 26:21.199
because you
feel obligated.

26:21.860 --> 26:24.945
You know, like you feel
too guilty to leave.

26:24.979 --> 26:27.881
You know, I don't want you
to feel stuck with me.

26:27.916 --> 26:29.900
I'm not stuck with you, Cate.

26:29.934 --> 26:32.603
I'm here with you.

26:32.637 --> 26:35.289
You and I, we're partners.

26:36.875 --> 26:38.792
I know I've done some things

26:38.827 --> 26:40.894
where it didn't
really feel like it.

26:43.915 --> 26:46.600
I-I never should've
let the station fire you.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.170
And I never should've

26:50.221 --> 26:53.757
made you feel like having a kid
of my own was...

26:53.791 --> 26:56.093
was more important
than you and Lux.

26:56.127 --> 26:59.747
Because if I had
to choose,

26:59.781 --> 27:02.850
I would choose what keeps me
with you.

27:04.799 --> 27:06.550
I've been in meetings
with Corporate all afternoon

27:06.601 --> 27:10.354
to do what I should've done
right after we got married:

27:10.388 --> 27:13.807
to fight for us.

27:14.726 --> 27:17.677
I got the show back.

27:17.695 --> 27:18.746
You... you did?

27:18.780 --> 27:20.731
Yeah. Yeah, I told them

27:20.782 --> 27:22.666
I would never be a solo act.

27:22.700 --> 27:26.870
That you and I...

27:26.905 --> 27:28.655
we're a team.

27:37.215 --> 27:40.000
I really wanted that baby.

27:47.542 --> 27:49.593
I did, too.

28:01.272 --> 28:03.006
Jack!

28:03.041 --> 28:04.908
Oh, Nate, Nate, Nate!

28:04.943 --> 28:07.077
Wait.

28:07.111 --> 28:08.111
Come here.

28:08.163 --> 28:10.914
Thank you for such
a wonderful party.

28:10.949 --> 28:11.915
Oh,

28:11.950 --> 28:12.833
you're welcome, Mom.

28:12.867 --> 28:14.501
It was just great.
It was fun.

28:14.569 --> 28:15.953
Yeah.

28:18.506 --> 28:21.074
I'll be right with you.
Okay.

28:24.429 --> 28:26.663
Thank you...

28:26.698 --> 28:28.382
for not saying anything.

28:28.416 --> 28:32.803
I did it for Mom, not you.

28:34.022 --> 28:36.523
I don't want to try
to be you anymore, Dad.

28:36.558 --> 28:39.276
I want to be me.

28:39.310 --> 28:44.114
You, uh... you have
some sort of plan

28:44.148 --> 28:45.899
what you're gonna do?

28:45.933 --> 28:49.303
'Cause I'm not gonna
keep bailing you out.

28:49.337 --> 28:51.688
I don't need you to.

28:51.723 --> 28:55.108
In fact, I think I found
a buyer for the bar.

28:55.143 --> 28:56.510
What?

28:56.544 --> 28:57.694
Who?

28:57.729 --> 28:59.913
Me.

29:17.131 --> 29:20.517
I get why you like it up here.
It's cozy.

29:20.568 --> 29:22.586
Well...

29:22.620 --> 29:24.938
in a claustrophobic, attic-y
kind of way.

29:29.527 --> 29:33.330
Look, I, uh...

29:33.364 --> 29:36.116
I know you think that
I don't get how you feel.

29:38.319 --> 29:41.788
But I understand feeling broken
on the inside.

29:45.877 --> 29:47.494
I lost the baby.

29:49.764 --> 29:53.834
And I am not going to be able
to get pregnant again.

29:54.802 --> 29:56.803
Oh, my God, I'm ...

29:56.838 --> 29:59.506
I'm... I'm s... I'm so sorry.

29:59.524 --> 30:02.526
Me, too.

30:03.428 --> 30:05.762
I get it, Lux.

30:05.797 --> 30:08.682
You know,
I get feeling like a dud.

30:08.700 --> 30:12.352
Feeling not good enough.

30:12.370 --> 30:15.038
But you...

30:15.073 --> 30:17.791
you're good enough.

30:17.825 --> 30:19.710
And we all love you.

30:19.744 --> 30:21.328
You know, I know
that you think

30:21.362 --> 30:23.997
that you have to hide all
of these parts of you,

30:24.031 --> 30:26.249
that they're gonna
make us love you less.

30:26.284 --> 30:29.336
But they really only make us
love you more.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.838
I mean, if I
could only have

30:31.872 --> 30:33.757
one kid for the rest of my life,

30:33.808 --> 30:35.875
knowing everything
that I know about you

30:35.893 --> 30:38.428
and even the things
that I don't know...

30:42.767 --> 30:44.618
...I would choose you.

30:46.688 --> 30:48.605
Look, I know

30:48.656 --> 30:51.057
that I haven't been
a good listener,

30:51.075 --> 30:52.609
and I know you think

30:52.660 --> 30:54.894
that I don't understand
your side of things.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.064
But I want to.

30:58.082 --> 31:00.951
You know, I want to know
about you and Eric.

31:01.002 --> 31:04.187
I want to know why he meant
so much to you.

31:04.222 --> 31:06.606
I just... I want to listen,

31:06.641 --> 31:09.042
you know, if you
want to tell me.

31:18.052 --> 31:20.887
Do you remember
the day we, um,

31:20.921 --> 31:23.590
got back from the honeymoon?

31:23.624 --> 31:27.961
That was the day we met...
at the bar.

31:29.447 --> 31:31.531
He thought
I was a bartender.

31:33.004 --> 31:35.723
What up, Portland?!

31:35.757 --> 31:39.176
After a few days off, it is
great to be back on the air.

31:39.210 --> 31:41.729
But even greater to be back
with my old partner-in-crime,

31:41.763 --> 31:44.715
Cate Cassidy, who's come out
of semi-radio retirement

31:44.733 --> 31:48.102
to once again wreak havoc
on the airwaves.

31:48.153 --> 31:50.070
Yes, and for our first
day back together,

31:50.105 --> 31:53.407
we are reviving our favorite
game, "Sex, Marry, Kill."

31:53.441 --> 31:56.226
And I believe it is your turn to choose.
Oh, okay, all rightie,

31:56.244 --> 31:57.578
well, then lay it on me.
I got one.

31:57.612 --> 32:00.063
Here you go. You ready?
Yes. Uh, I'm ready. Go.

32:00.081 --> 32:02.616
I think, I think, we're gonna go
with the Louies:

32:02.667 --> 32:06.103
Anderson, Armstrong
or Farrakhan?

32:06.137 --> 32:08.923
No, no, the last time we played
this game, I gave you

32:08.957 --> 32:11.342
the Jessicas: I gave you, Biel,
I gave you Alba,

32:11.376 --> 32:12.543
I gave you Simpson.

32:12.577 --> 32:14.094
Tell you what,
I'll give you Louis XIV.

32:14.129 --> 32:17.164
Oh, right, because I am dying
to have sex with a guy

32:17.199 --> 32:18.682
from before
they invented bathing.

32:18.717 --> 32:19.767
Yeah.

32:19.801 --> 32:20.768
In all seriousness,

32:20.802 --> 32:22.252
the person I most want

32:22.270 --> 32:24.471
to have sex with is you.

32:26.090 --> 32:27.725
Me, too.

32:30.061 --> 32:32.062
Now what about kill?

32:32.096 --> 32:33.647
Yeah, that's pretty much you,
too.

32:33.698 --> 32:34.481
Yeah.

32:34.533 --> 32:35.733
I mean, you realize

32:35.767 --> 32:36.817
that you're basically incapable

32:36.868 --> 32:38.168
of putting the toilet seat down,
right?

32:38.203 --> 32:39.486
Oh, come on.

32:39.521 --> 32:41.038
Did you not hear Lux
scream this morning

32:41.072 --> 32:42.489
<i>'cause she fell in.</i>

32:50.832 --> 32:51.999
Don't want to ruin the new bar.
Yo, yo!

32:52.050 --> 32:53.116
Hey.

32:53.134 --> 32:54.752
Cate said
you were on the verge

32:54.786 --> 32:56.453
of becoming a bar owner, so we
thought we'd come down and help.

32:56.471 --> 32:58.722
Well, who... who is this "we"
we're talking about?

32:58.757 --> 33:01.725
Uh, well, Cate
is at the doctor,

33:01.760 --> 33:03.794
and, uh, well, Lux...

33:03.812 --> 33:06.129
We just got back from the DMV.

33:06.147 --> 33:07.514
You passed?

33:07.549 --> 33:09.099
No way.

33:10.602 --> 33:11.936
You did it? Come here.

33:11.970 --> 33:13.804
Come here, you.

33:16.658 --> 33:18.776
I'm proud of you, kiddo.

33:21.112 --> 33:23.581
Yeah, well, I...
I owe it to you.

33:23.615 --> 33:24.999
Want a beer, man?

33:25.033 --> 33:26.500
Oh, yeah.

33:31.673 --> 33:33.457
Uh...

33:33.491 --> 33:37.211
You know, it's...
it's not just the license.

33:38.880 --> 33:43.350
Everything that I have
in my life now...

33:43.385 --> 33:47.805
I owe so much to you.

33:47.839 --> 33:49.306
And I'm... I'm so sorry

33:49.340 --> 33:51.475
that I ruined everything
with you and Emma.

33:51.509 --> 33:52.726
Hey.

33:52.777 --> 33:54.028
You know what?

33:54.062 --> 33:55.980
Things were ruined
with Emma and me

33:56.014 --> 33:57.865
whether you said anything
or not.

33:59.150 --> 34:01.318
Look, I could deal
with losing

34:01.352 --> 34:03.186
anyone in this world--

34:03.204 --> 34:08.125
my dad, Emma, Cate--

34:08.159 --> 34:10.043
but not you.

34:12.246 --> 34:14.732
I never, ever want to lose you.

34:26.428 --> 34:28.728
Uh-oh, Shirley Temples!

34:28.763 --> 34:30.179
Shirley Temples.
All right.

34:30.214 --> 34:31.482
I want a beer, please.

34:31.516 --> 34:32.933
A beer?
Yes.

34:34.936 --> 34:37.987
Do you need to schedule
your next appointment?

34:38.889 --> 34:41.574
No, I don't.

34:41.609 --> 34:43.077
Julia?

34:43.110 --> 34:44.895
The doctor will see you now.

34:44.913 --> 34:47.563
Okay. Thank you.

34:53.288 --> 34:55.456
Oh, my God.

34:56.925 --> 34:58.959
Um...

35:04.215 --> 35:06.016
- <i>Huh?</i>
- <i>Wow.</i>

35:06.051 --> 35:08.085
How's it look? Huh? Pretty good?

35:08.103 --> 35:09.753
Wait a minute.
What? Hey!

35:09.771 --> 35:11.605
Hey. How's anybody going to
recognize you in this picture?

35:11.639 --> 35:12.973
You don't have your
little hat on.

35:13.024 --> 35:14.475
Let me see it.
Let me see it.

35:14.526 --> 35:16.593
Oh, wow.

35:16.611 --> 35:18.729
Geez. Wait a minute.
That's how much you weigh?

35:18.763 --> 35:21.949
Lux, I could do bicep curls
with you.

35:21.983 --> 35:23.150
Oh, yeah, like
you work out.

35:23.201 --> 35:24.535
Oh, you too short?
Too short?

35:24.569 --> 35:26.203
No, I work out.
Uh-huh.

35:26.237 --> 35:27.738
I run.
Oh, yeah?

35:27.772 --> 35:30.324
Running out of a burning
building doesn't count.

35:30.375 --> 35:32.459
You know what?
Hey! Hey!

35:32.494 --> 35:34.945
No! No!
Oh! Whoa!

35:36.915 --> 35:38.749
Guys, don't.

35:38.783 --> 35:41.251
No more. No more.
Seriously!

35:47.792 --> 35:49.459
Seriously, back away. Back off.

35:50.395 --> 35:51.812
I got the high ground.

35:51.846 --> 35:54.148
Oh, no, no!

35:54.182 --> 35:55.399
Cate!

35:55.433 --> 35:56.767
Yay.
Hey!

35:56.801 --> 35:58.836
Hi, Cate.

36:00.922 --> 36:02.656
What's wrong?

36:03.608 --> 36:05.359
What happened?

36:11.783 --> 36:14.118
We have to talk.

36:20.925 --> 36:22.993
<i>I stand here today,</i>

36:23.027 --> 36:25.896
<i>thinking about the future</i>

36:25.930 --> 36:28.132
and what unknowns
lie ahead.

36:29.834 --> 36:32.335
I never thought
I would be up here,

36:32.353 --> 36:33.854
wearing a cap and gown,

36:33.888 --> 36:36.607
looking out at so many people
that I love,

36:36.641 --> 36:40.360
about to graduate high school
with all of you.

36:40.395 --> 36:41.845
Oh, wow.

36:41.863 --> 36:43.947
Oh, did she kick?
Yeah.

36:45.150 --> 36:46.650
Okay.
Hey.

36:46.684 --> 36:48.235
Hi.
Is he okay?

36:48.286 --> 36:49.403
Yeah, he's great.

36:49.454 --> 36:51.288
I'm a wreck,
but, uh, he's great.

36:51.322 --> 36:52.289
Hi.

36:52.323 --> 36:53.874
Did I miss anything?
No, no, no.

36:53.908 --> 36:55.292
She just started. Hi.
Okay.

36:55.326 --> 36:58.412
Everyone told me to
just write what I know.

36:58.463 --> 37:00.747
Well, I know that two years ago,

37:00.799 --> 37:03.667
I never would have been able
to write this speech.

37:03.701 --> 37:07.554
And I never could have pictured
myself going to college, and...

37:07.589 --> 37:11.341
and now I'm going to college
with my best friend.

37:11.375 --> 37:12.375
Go, Ducks!

37:16.231 --> 37:19.366
Um, I-I know
that in my time here,

37:19.400 --> 37:23.520
I have learned more than I ever
thought that I could.

37:23.554 --> 37:25.889
I-I managed to pass subjects

37:25.907 --> 37:28.558
that I used to not even be able
to spell,

37:28.576 --> 37:30.511
like... like calculus.

37:30.545 --> 37:33.530
Like physics,

37:33.564 --> 37:35.532
which I loved,

37:35.566 --> 37:38.502
because the laws of physics
are basically the laws of life.

37:38.536 --> 37:42.089
With all the unpredictable chaos
around us,

37:42.123 --> 37:46.176
there are certain universal
constants-- gravity,

37:46.211 --> 37:47.761
the speed of light.

37:47.795 --> 37:50.097
These constants never change,

37:50.131 --> 37:53.100
even when everything
else around them does.

37:53.134 --> 37:57.337
Life is full of
unknowns, and when

37:57.372 --> 37:59.823
those unknowns
are too overwhelming,

37:59.858 --> 38:03.260
it's the constants
that we have to hold on to.

38:04.145 --> 38:06.213
Like our friends.

38:06.247 --> 38:10.951
The ones who are
not afraid to

38:10.985 --> 38:13.537
tell us that
there's no such thing as normal.

38:15.406 --> 38:17.524
The ones who have
been in our life,

38:17.559 --> 38:20.210
for every minute with you,

38:20.245 --> 38:23.213
even the hardest minutes.

38:24.132 --> 38:26.250
Like those who

38:26.284 --> 38:29.386
could have walked away,

38:29.420 --> 38:31.338
but chose to stick around,

38:31.389 --> 38:33.456
even though they had

38:33.474 --> 38:35.509
their own lives,

38:35.560 --> 38:38.795
families, their own children.

38:39.898 --> 38:41.965
Like our parents,

38:41.983 --> 38:45.385
because we wouldn't be here
without them...

38:48.022 --> 38:50.707
...who pick us up
when we fall...

38:50.742 --> 38:53.627
who come when we call them...

38:53.661 --> 38:57.147
;
who answer when we knock.

39:03.004 --> 39:05.589
We all learned
what a light-year is.

39:06.874 --> 39:08.842
And these years together...

39:08.876 --> 39:10.877
have been our light-years.

39:10.929 --> 39:14.464
The years where everything
became brighter,

39:14.498 --> 39:17.267
and we learned that

39:17.302 --> 39:19.102
the bright spots in our life

39:19.137 --> 39:23.824
aren't merely spots,

39:23.858 --> 39:25.976
but constants.

39:27.812 --> 39:29.980
And no matter where I go,

39:30.014 --> 39:32.115
or what I do...

39:33.051 --> 39:36.086
...you are my constant.

39:40.241 --> 39:42.359
May you never forget yours.

39:44.429 --> 39:49.216
And now, if the Class of 2012
will turn their tassels...

39:52.804 --> 39:56.857
We... are... graduated!

40:39.417 --> 40:44.087
She made it.

40:44.105 --> 40:46.556
So did we.

41:09.297 --> 41:12.549
Uh, do you guys
want to stop making out

41:12.583 --> 41:15.168
so we can take a picture?

41:17.088 --> 41:18.505
Mom, Dad.

41:18.556 --> 41:20.090
Come on.

41:20.124 --> 41:22.792
Let's go take
a picture.

41:22.810 --> 41:24.594
Come on,
who's taking the picture?

41:24.628 --> 41:26.296
I don't know,
I don't know, come on.

41:35.857 --> 41:38.808
One, two, three.
