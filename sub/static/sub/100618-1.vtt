WEBVTT

01:25.602 --> 01:27.132
- Hey, hey.

01:56.993 --> 01:58.127
- Whoo!

01:58.127 --> 01:59.009
And I'm going in.

02:04.478 --> 02:05.311
- Oh!

02:05.311 --> 02:06.497
- Don't worry about it.

02:06.497 --> 02:08.572
Pick it up where you left
it, where you dropped it off.

02:08.572 --> 02:10.697
- Bitch don't feel like tucking.

02:12.954 --> 02:14.664
- Cash rule everything around me.

02:14.664 --> 02:17.174
And I'd kill a fucking
nigga trying to down me.

02:17.174 --> 02:18.976
Kicking pimping, trying
to kill me on the top.

02:18.976 --> 02:20.216
All the nigga talk shit.

02:20.216 --> 02:21.658
I really want to talk.

02:21.658 --> 02:22.624
All they want is cash, right?

02:22.624 --> 02:23.872
Yeah, I want that ass too.

02:23.872 --> 02:24.934
All these niggas talk shit.

02:24.934 --> 02:26.224
Tell me what you're gonna do.

02:26.224 --> 02:27.347
I'm gonna go and pop shit.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.557
Niggas I'm the top shit.

02:28.557 --> 02:30.772
Everybody talk, God damn on the top.

02:30.772 --> 02:31.605
- Hey!

02:31.605 --> 02:33.222
- Stay on top, stay on guard.

02:33.222 --> 02:36.026
Free cool wop, Gs on me, Gucci I be.

02:36.026 --> 02:37.981
All of 'em, I don't need no rap-a lot

02:37.981 --> 02:38.852
to clap a lot.

02:38.852 --> 02:41.498
Niggas wanna tell 'em you in Camelot.

02:41.498 --> 02:43.659
- If you want to cap a
lot, I'll do a cap a lot.

02:43.659 --> 02:44.930
And all these niggas talk shit

02:44.930 --> 02:46.064
but I boom shit.

02:46.064 --> 02:48.321
Other niggas talk shit,
but I've been the shit.

02:48.321 --> 02:49.466
See, I just hop in the shit.

02:49.466 --> 02:50.822
And I might peel off in it.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.459
- Hey, we don't even know you.

02:52.459 --> 02:53.697
What you talking about?

02:53.697 --> 02:54.548
Keep on running your mouth,

02:54.548 --> 02:55.988
you'll be a bitch your mama helps.

02:55.988 --> 02:58.443
Matter fact, you're gonna
be pushing flowers up.

02:58.443 --> 03:00.890
Matter fact, who is you to fuck us up?

03:00.890 --> 03:02.055
- Oh!
- You gonna fuck us up.

03:02.055 --> 03:03.414
Sell 'em 100 dollar kits.

03:08.452 --> 03:10.499
Sipping that lean, yeah
you see I'm slow as shit.

03:10.499 --> 03:12.496
Slowed up or poled up.

03:19.302 --> 03:20.844
- That's my city.
- Man, fuck you.

03:20.844 --> 03:21.923
This my city, nigga.

03:21.923 --> 03:23.701
What the fuck you talking about, pussy?

03:23.701 --> 03:24.534
- Oh really, really?
- Yeah.

03:24.534 --> 03:25.627
- Straight up.

03:32.201 --> 03:35.992
- Moved to Atlanta
for this music shit

03:35.992 --> 03:36.825
- Labareis.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.905
- That's my little brother Kenny.

03:39.905 --> 03:40.903
- Labareis!

03:40.903 --> 03:44.403
- He's cool as hell with the flow.

03:45.492 --> 03:48.825
And just died in front of my bitch crib.

03:49.847 --> 03:53.010
Somebody about to die.

03:53.010 --> 03:53.859
- The dangerous trend

03:53.859 --> 03:56.566
of gaining street
credibility in the rap world

03:56.566 --> 03:59.056
is high in statistics
in black on black crime.

03:59.056 --> 04:00.904
We ask the question, are the streets

04:00.904 --> 04:02.393
and the industry one in the same

04:02.393 --> 04:04.031
when it relates to violence?

04:04.031 --> 04:05.873
Reporting live, Atlanta, Georgia.

04:05.873 --> 04:07.091
- It wasn't right!

04:07.091 --> 04:11.218
He didn't steal nothing or none of that.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.834
And this motherfucker shoots my brother

04:12.834 --> 04:16.167
in broad daylight, in front of everyone!

04:18.483 --> 04:20.919
Right in front of Labareis' house.

04:20.919 --> 04:25.349
This don't make no sense.

04:25.349 --> 04:29.659
Everybody knows Labareis
don't play no games.

04:29.659 --> 04:32.409
But then nobody sees shit, right?

05:13.881 --> 05:15.390
- Kenny was killed
in front of his brother

05:15.390 --> 05:17.304
Rilla's side chick's house.

05:17.304 --> 05:18.137
Blu.

05:19.234 --> 05:22.081
And this is Desiree, his sister.

05:22.081 --> 05:24.319
I'm her boyfriend, Cortney.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.427
- The bad part is,

05:27.427 --> 05:30.491
she just found a letter
that Kenny got last night.

05:30.491 --> 05:33.436
He got selected to be
on the TV show "Turnt."

05:33.436 --> 05:36.323
And a million dollar record deal.

05:36.323 --> 05:39.160
Now this fucked our whole family up.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.898
Pray for us.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.039
- We don't know
if Kenny knew this dude,

06:18.039 --> 06:19.168
or if the dude got mad

06:19.168 --> 06:21.384
'cause he lost in a rap battle.

06:21.384 --> 06:24.867
Or if somebody was trying
to take Rilla's spot.

06:24.867 --> 06:26.491
We started with his family.

06:26.491 --> 06:27.872
We don't know.

06:27.872 --> 06:30.101
But I'm sure Rilla gonna find out.

06:38.530 --> 06:41.300
- Yeah look, I'm okay, Cort.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.133
- You sure?
- Yeah.

06:42.133 --> 06:44.664
Just go ahead in mama house.

06:44.664 --> 06:46.517
I need to do this.

06:46.517 --> 06:47.986
- Okay, look.

06:47.986 --> 06:49.726
I'm gonna be right behind you.

06:49.726 --> 06:51.059
Alright?
- Okay.

06:51.972 --> 06:53.103
- Meet you there?
- Yeah.

06:53.103 --> 06:55.263
- Alright, love you.
- Love you.

07:55.089 --> 07:56.089
- Oh my God!

07:58.541 --> 08:02.109
Oh God.

08:02.109 --> 08:03.359
- First of all,

08:04.449 --> 08:07.866
I'd like to give honor and praise to God.

08:09.575 --> 08:13.200
And as you can see the pain of a mother.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.404
Losing a child is one of the most

08:15.404 --> 08:17.654
unnatural things in nature.

08:19.364 --> 08:24.277
I can't imagine the pain
that a mother go through.

08:24.277 --> 08:28.292
Though even when he finally
reach this destination,

08:28.292 --> 08:31.770
when you finally, finally
reach this destination, mama,

08:31.770 --> 08:34.329
you know what you can have?

08:34.329 --> 08:37.132
You can have joy on your face.

08:37.132 --> 08:39.465
Because we all will be here.

08:40.498 --> 08:42.614
But you can have joy on your face

08:42.614 --> 08:45.364
that Kenny is in a righteous way.

08:46.979 --> 08:48.932
That he will be able to give,

08:48.932 --> 08:51.015
and gave his life for us.

08:54.146 --> 08:54.979
Amen.

08:57.519 --> 08:59.602
- That's my wife.

09:00.951 --> 09:03.118
We ain't been cool lately.

09:04.995 --> 09:05.828
I think she's just here

09:05.828 --> 09:07.828
for the love of my mama.

09:18.243 --> 09:20.852
In my hood, everything goes.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.440
At least everything goes through me.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.357
I don't trust no nigga.

09:26.462 --> 09:27.379
Except Blu.

09:29.859 --> 09:31.859
She handles all my shit.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.072
But she loves a nigga for real.

10:06.205 --> 10:08.629
- I'm Kenny's uncle.

10:08.629 --> 10:11.600
Listen, let me tell you this.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.694
This is nobody's fault.

10:13.694 --> 10:15.777
And especially not yours.

10:16.880 --> 10:17.713
Okay?

10:18.974 --> 10:21.141
What was your name, again?

10:22.160 --> 10:24.074
- It's Tanya Clark.

10:24.074 --> 10:26.608
- Tanya Clark.
- Kenny's girlfriend.

10:26.608 --> 10:27.617
- Okay, Tanya.

10:27.617 --> 10:29.700
You just be strong, okay?

10:32.860 --> 10:35.693
You just, just be strong, alright?

10:37.367 --> 10:38.624
Now listen.

10:38.624 --> 10:41.444
Let's go join the rest of the family.

10:41.444 --> 10:46.244
- We thank God for every meal
that landed on the table.

10:46.244 --> 10:49.411
Before going to bed at night, we pray.

10:50.284 --> 10:51.473
And the next morning,

10:51.473 --> 10:55.287
we pray thanking God for
letting us see another day.

10:55.287 --> 10:58.802
And I continue that with my children.

10:58.802 --> 11:02.469
My youngest son, he
used to say this prayer.

11:04.659 --> 11:07.659
Now I lay me and mama down to sleep,

11:09.279 --> 11:12.446
I pray to the lord my soul he'll keep.

11:14.629 --> 11:17.129
If I should die before I wake,

11:18.272 --> 11:21.093
I pray the lord my soul he'll take.

11:21.093 --> 11:23.093
And Jesus took his soul.

11:25.976 --> 11:29.145
Now I see the faces of
my remaining children.

11:29.145 --> 11:31.059
I see the pain.

11:31.059 --> 11:32.309
I see the hurt.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.820
I see the revenge.

11:36.157 --> 11:38.930
And that's why I live in
Revelations 21 and four,

11:38.930 --> 11:42.512
that says you've got to put
God before your children.

11:42.512 --> 11:46.345
Says you have to put God
before your children.

11:47.342 --> 11:51.765
I will say that 100 times
until I can smile again.

11:51.765 --> 11:53.675
So please pray for me.

11:53.675 --> 11:54.508
Please.

11:57.441 --> 12:00.295
Now, Kenny wanted to be a rap star,

12:00.295 --> 12:03.298
but I wanted him to be a doctor,

12:03.298 --> 12:06.188
and I never listened to that music.

12:06.188 --> 12:07.526
But I want to hear Kenny's voice

12:07.526 --> 12:10.958
coming out of every speaker in this house.

12:10.958 --> 12:12.507
And we're gonna sit and have this meal

12:12.507 --> 12:16.090
the way Kenny would
sit and have this meal.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.206
- I have it in my phone.

12:39.485 --> 12:43.080
- Rilla didn't
make it to Kenny's re-pass.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.474
It's hard on him, I know.

12:45.474 --> 12:48.197
But he out there turning
every stone he can

12:48.197 --> 12:49.895
to find out who killed Kenny.

13:01.379 --> 13:02.964
- What's up, baby?

13:02.964 --> 13:03.914
- What's up?
- Then?

13:03.914 --> 13:05.898
What's the urgent meeting about?

13:05.898 --> 13:07.469
- I think I know who killed Kenny.

13:07.469 --> 13:09.264
- How sure are you about that?

13:09.264 --> 13:11.544
- I'm 100% sure.

13:11.544 --> 13:13.711
- So what do I need to do?

13:14.889 --> 13:17.697
- I need to talk to Rilla.

13:17.697 --> 13:20.288
- Now, you know that ain't gonna happen.

13:20.288 --> 13:22.383
- I need to talk to Rilla.

13:22.383 --> 13:24.592
- Baby, calm down.

13:24.592 --> 13:25.797
- Don't tell me to calm down

13:25.797 --> 13:28.142
when the motherfucker that killed Kenny

13:28.142 --> 13:30.994
is coming after his ass next.

13:30.994 --> 13:32.527
- Well I guess you right.

13:32.527 --> 13:34.527
Let me go holler at him.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.480
- What's up?

13:52.347 --> 13:53.799
- I need to talk to you.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.497
- You here, right?

13:55.497 --> 13:59.013
- I need to talk to
you about your brother.

13:59.013 --> 14:01.020
- What the fuck did you just say?

14:01.020 --> 14:03.862
- I need to talk to you
about your brother Kenny.

14:03.862 --> 14:05.195
- What you know?

14:07.027 --> 14:09.454
- I know about this much.

14:09.454 --> 14:13.036
I know that, well, I
won't say where I was...

14:13.036 --> 14:15.210
- I don't give a fuck about where you was.

14:15.210 --> 14:16.377
What you know?

14:17.427 --> 14:19.191
- Well, I know who killed Kenny,

14:19.191 --> 14:21.849
and the person that killed Kenny said

14:21.849 --> 14:22.850
that you were next.

14:22.850 --> 14:25.433
- Get the fuck up off my porch.

14:30.231 --> 14:31.335
- Man, if it was me,

14:31.335 --> 14:34.020
I'd add a whole block out.

14:34.020 --> 14:34.996
It is what it is.

14:34.996 --> 14:37.074
It's gonna be what it's gonna be.

14:37.074 --> 14:38.463
- You're right about that.

14:38.463 --> 14:41.253
- I ain't playing with these lames, nigga.

14:41.253 --> 14:44.386
I ain't playing with nobody.

14:44.386 --> 14:46.897
I fuck around to catch a body.

14:46.897 --> 14:48.523
- Yeah yeah, I mean,
this feeling is mutual.

14:48.523 --> 14:49.692
You know that.

14:49.692 --> 14:51.806
It's just that loyalty shit
I'm stuck on, you know?

14:51.806 --> 14:53.341
I don't want nobody getting out of line.

14:53.341 --> 14:54.182
- Man, don't even trip.

14:54.182 --> 14:56.474
These niggas is lame down here, man.

14:56.474 --> 14:57.860
I'm from Philly.

14:57.860 --> 14:59.479
You know how that Eagle do.

14:59.479 --> 15:00.386
- Right.

15:00.386 --> 15:02.234
It's just a nigga shooter came to the crib

15:02.234 --> 15:04.249
with some chick with that Escalade.

15:04.249 --> 15:06.180
She talking about little bro.

15:06.180 --> 15:08.473
- It's probably her niggas.

15:08.473 --> 15:10.303
It's her boyfriend, dog.

15:10.303 --> 15:11.456
What's her name?

15:11.456 --> 15:13.367
- I don't even know.

15:13.367 --> 15:15.649
We'll call Sugar though.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.132
- He gonna need a new bitch.

15:17.132 --> 15:17.965
I got him.

15:19.097 --> 15:21.275
What you doing with that?

15:21.275 --> 15:22.361
- That's for you, what you mean?

15:22.361 --> 15:24.046
- No, put that money up, man.

15:24.046 --> 15:27.440
This is loyalty in a physical form, yo.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.129
Put that shit up, man.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.660
- Ah, fuck it.

15:31.493 --> 15:32.981
- We out.

15:32.981 --> 15:34.829
- With all this pain

15:34.829 --> 15:36.910
my momma was going through.

15:36.910 --> 15:41.116
Now it was time to tear
this motherfucker up.

15:43.055 --> 15:44.670
- Nigga be shouting
me, blowing my phone up

15:44.670 --> 15:45.503
talking about money.

15:45.503 --> 15:47.327
I don't want to talk about money.

15:47.327 --> 15:48.160
You know what I mean?

15:48.160 --> 15:50.099
Shit, you know, your shit on point.

15:50.099 --> 15:51.454
God damn!

15:51.454 --> 15:53.716
- See the reason
why Rilla is so powerful,

15:53.716 --> 15:55.213
'cause he move different.
- Hey!

15:55.213 --> 15:56.815
- He ain't got
to touch you his self.

15:56.815 --> 15:57.648
- What's up?

15:57.648 --> 15:58.895
- He got killers on the payroll.

15:58.895 --> 15:59.867
No cap.

15:59.867 --> 16:01.570
This is Zina Holloway.

16:01.570 --> 16:03.004
Zina is his baby momma.
- What's up?

16:03.004 --> 16:05.332
- And she would
literally do anything

16:05.332 --> 16:06.334
that nigga asked.
- For what?

16:06.334 --> 16:07.444
- Ride or die.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.569
- Why do you keep putting
your hands in your pockets?

16:09.569 --> 16:12.341
- Plus, she's
sexier than a motherfucker.

16:12.341 --> 16:13.498
- You're not getting my fucking number.

16:16.748 --> 16:19.998
- And she don't take no shit.

16:26.448 --> 16:28.886
- Cortney wanted me to rap for Blu.

16:28.886 --> 16:30.592
I got a major connect in the music world

16:30.592 --> 16:32.506
out there in LA.

16:32.506 --> 16:34.354
Rita Robinson.

16:34.354 --> 16:36.251
Running everything.

16:36.251 --> 16:38.182
So I'll do it.

16:38.182 --> 16:39.766
I'm fucking with her.

16:47.397 --> 16:52.132
- I don't give a damn what
you singers care about.

16:52.132 --> 16:53.882
Sure, you love music.

16:54.755 --> 16:56.870
Music is your world.

16:56.870 --> 17:00.183
I know music, and I know business.

17:00.183 --> 17:01.600
But I love money.

17:03.682 --> 17:04.887
That's why Robinson Music Group

17:04.887 --> 17:06.916
has had over 80 top 100s.

17:06.916 --> 17:09.083
Something like 30 top 40s,

17:09.938 --> 17:12.021
and a handful of top 10s.

17:13.170 --> 17:14.697
But you want to know why we haven't had

17:14.697 --> 17:18.188
any number ones in over two years?

17:18.188 --> 17:19.521
Because of egos.

17:20.538 --> 17:22.754
For a lack of a better term,

17:22.754 --> 17:25.671
a bitch is quick to turn Hollywood.

17:28.251 --> 17:29.084
But you,

17:30.659 --> 17:34.059
Tamela, you have a
flawless stage presence.

17:34.059 --> 17:36.888
You write your own songs.

17:36.888 --> 17:40.971
And your voice is so
melodic, it's like an angel.

17:43.449 --> 17:45.446
But that ain't gonna get
your ass to number one.

17:52.954 --> 17:54.093
- The same thing.

17:54.093 --> 17:55.941
The same thing that all day we do.

17:55.941 --> 17:57.609
- And you're gonna be
the one that's buying it?

17:57.609 --> 17:58.442
- Of course.

17:58.442 --> 17:59.804
- You're gonna be the one that is buying?

17:59.804 --> 18:01.617
- Why are you playing me like that?

18:01.617 --> 18:03.368
- It's crazy that you're gonna
be the one that's buying.

18:03.368 --> 18:05.181
Ain't no way I was buying.

18:19.371 --> 18:22.371
- Where the fuck you going, playboy?

18:24.735 --> 18:26.083
- No, wait a minute.

18:26.083 --> 18:27.357
Wait a minute!
- Shut up nigga.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.227
Don't move nigga, I'll school you nigga.

18:29.227 --> 18:30.393
Pull out, bro, pull out, bro.

18:30.393 --> 18:32.239
Let's move, let's move, let's move.

18:41.912 --> 18:44.205
- So, you said you're
gonna chill out, huh?

18:44.205 --> 18:46.070
That means you're gonna
spend some time with me?

18:46.070 --> 18:48.182
- No, I got to make
some moves in a minute.

18:48.182 --> 18:50.534
Just want to take a little nap.

18:50.534 --> 18:53.029
Why is you drinking?

18:53.029 --> 18:54.696
Give me that bottle.

18:59.167 --> 19:00.139
- Maybe I wouldn't have had to drink

19:00.139 --> 19:02.467
if you was here at home.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.134
- So what, you got excuses now?

19:04.134 --> 19:06.541
- It's not an excuse.

19:06.541 --> 19:08.521
I'm just saying, I would appreciate it

19:08.521 --> 19:10.271
if you would hear me.

19:11.310 --> 19:13.977
- I ain't trying to do all that.

19:15.167 --> 19:16.938
- I be messing with you.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.668
- No, not right now, baby.

19:18.668 --> 19:20.238
You're tripping.
- I'm tripping?

19:20.238 --> 19:21.951
- Yeah man, you know my nigga's stressing.

19:21.951 --> 19:23.536
- Okay, this was to un-stress you.

19:23.536 --> 19:24.509
- Yeah, I understand.

19:24.509 --> 19:26.342
I get it all the time.

19:27.622 --> 19:29.142
- I'm trying to make love to you,

19:29.142 --> 19:31.559
you're pushing me off of you.

19:34.618 --> 19:35.785
It's bullshit.

19:39.143 --> 19:42.476
It's exactly why I'm drinking right now.

19:44.291 --> 19:47.177
You know, I don't have to
deal with this bullshit.

19:56.483 --> 19:58.733
It's supposed to be always.

20:12.024 --> 20:14.202
- I finally
caught up with Rilla.

20:14.202 --> 20:15.720
After he made his momma promise

20:15.720 --> 20:17.621
that he would keep Kenny's dream alive,

20:17.621 --> 20:20.243
and start rapping himself.

20:20.243 --> 20:23.272
And after all this filing and shit,

20:23.272 --> 20:24.610
we got a chance to kick it

20:24.610 --> 20:27.197
about publishing and all type of shit.

20:27.197 --> 20:29.692
But I really don't think he give a fuck.

20:29.692 --> 20:31.949
All he know is the streets.

20:31.949 --> 20:33.349
To tell you the truth,

20:33.349 --> 20:36.094
I think he feels guilty
about what happened to Kenny,

20:36.094 --> 20:38.831
'cause Kenny was trying
to tell him about "Turnt"

20:38.831 --> 20:41.224
the night before he got killed.

20:41.224 --> 20:43.185
But Rilla didn't listen,

20:43.185 --> 20:47.116
'cause he was just worried about the bag.

20:53.216 --> 20:54.049
- How do you turn

20:54.049 --> 20:56.516
a street nigga into a rapper?

20:56.516 --> 20:58.378
I don't know.

20:58.378 --> 21:00.723
But this is Turnt Studios,

21:00.723 --> 21:03.284
the biggest music TV show in the world.

21:03.284 --> 21:05.000
And Kenny was about to be on it.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.848
Now I'm about to get Rilla on it.

21:21.434 --> 21:22.701
- The only other person

21:22.701 --> 21:26.467
that the hood is worried about is Meko.

21:26.467 --> 21:29.351
And Meko don't like Rilla.

21:29.351 --> 21:32.254
He don't like to see
nobody get money but him.

21:32.254 --> 21:34.746
- See that's what the fuck
I'm talking about, man.

21:34.746 --> 21:37.284
What the fuck is up with you, man?

21:37.284 --> 21:38.292
Mom and sis been saying

21:38.292 --> 21:40.831
you ain't been dropping
down like you supposed to.

21:40.831 --> 21:42.727
What's the problem?

21:42.727 --> 21:45.060
- I didn't want to tell you.

21:45.948 --> 21:48.042
East Blake, it's over.

21:48.042 --> 21:50.137
- What the fuck you mean it's over?

21:50.137 --> 21:53.219
Man listen man, 12 ain't
gonna touch that hood, man.

21:53.219 --> 21:54.594
They know I've been
taking care of that block

21:54.594 --> 21:55.877
for years now.

21:55.877 --> 21:58.800
Man get the fuck out of my
face with that bullshit, man.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.250
- Rilla, Rilla sent
Holloway through that money.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.083
She dropped 250 racks.

22:05.286 --> 22:07.018
So she came back this morning,

22:07.018 --> 22:08.652
she ate everybody out.

22:08.652 --> 22:10.518
What you want me to do about it?

22:10.518 --> 22:12.300
- What I want you to do about it?

22:12.300 --> 22:14.244
Man, go get my block together.

22:14.244 --> 22:16.506
And if you ain't got it
in you to kill a nigga,

22:16.506 --> 22:18.006
think about momma.

22:19.758 --> 22:20.976
Man, get the fuck on, man.

22:20.976 --> 22:22.059
Come on, man.

22:24.189 --> 22:25.329
You ready?

22:25.329 --> 22:26.475
- That's your little brother?

22:26.475 --> 22:27.308
- Yeah, man.

22:27.308 --> 22:28.988
For some reason, he said
he needed street cred.

22:28.988 --> 22:30.274
For his rap career.

22:30.274 --> 22:32.256
So you know, I put him in trap.

22:32.256 --> 22:34.020
But he ain't built for this shit, bro.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.520
Come on, let's go.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.722
- This dumb ass promoter

22:40.722 --> 22:44.515
done fucked around and
crossed Rilla over some money.

22:44.515 --> 22:45.623
And as his manager,

22:45.623 --> 22:47.548
I'm forced to stick my head in the middle

22:47.548 --> 22:50.045
and make sure nobody get their ass killed.

22:50.045 --> 22:51.477
How are you gonna play
us for the 25 though?

22:51.477 --> 22:52.899
- Cool it, man.

22:52.899 --> 22:55.139
I ain't playing y'all, bro.

22:55.139 --> 22:56.463
I mean things as they go the way that they

22:56.463 --> 22:57.963
was supposed to go, man.

22:57.963 --> 23:00.735
I mean, you know, it's
like that sometimes, man,

23:00.735 --> 23:02.610
when you're in this business, man.

23:02.610 --> 23:05.205
I mean, I barely broke even.

23:05.205 --> 23:08.473
- Dog, don't insult my intelligence, man.

23:08.473 --> 23:10.154
You came to me for 25.

23:10.154 --> 23:12.003
I said I didn't want to
have nothing to do with it.

23:12.003 --> 23:14.199
You go to Rilla for the
10, plus another 15.

23:14.199 --> 23:15.748
Told him he was gonna headline.

23:15.748 --> 23:18.801
- Man, y'all must not communicate.

23:18.801 --> 23:20.697
Ain't you his manager?

23:20.697 --> 23:22.620
Man, he did headline the show, bro.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.873
I mean, he just chose not to go up, shit.

23:24.873 --> 23:26.295
That ain't on me.

23:27.641 --> 23:28.899
- Three o'clock?

23:28.899 --> 23:30.466
I ain't no rookie, my nigga.

23:30.466 --> 23:32.182
Who the fuck headline at three o'clock?

23:32.182 --> 23:34.765
- Man, bro, you not, but he is.

23:35.778 --> 23:36.819
I mean, he said he'd get his money

23:36.819 --> 23:38.069
in the streets, anyway.

23:38.069 --> 23:39.363
- Yeah.

23:39.363 --> 23:41.752
Tell you what, you better
hope he don't find out though.

23:41.752 --> 23:43.055
Because he'll blow your
motherfucking head off

23:43.055 --> 23:45.840
for shit like this, and you know that.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.509
- I mean, he ain't
throwing a thug out here

23:47.509 --> 23:49.631
with guns finally.

23:49.631 --> 23:50.479
You know what I'm saying?

23:50.479 --> 23:52.324
But, at the end of the day, man,

23:52.324 --> 23:55.110
I got a situation next week at Blu house.

23:55.110 --> 23:56.759
I put him on that show,

23:56.759 --> 23:57.962
I give him 10K.

23:57.962 --> 23:58.889
I mean, the rest of it,

23:58.889 --> 24:00.522
we're just gonna have to
work that shit out, man.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.766
- Wow, that nigga is not
finna go for that, man.

24:02.766 --> 24:04.235
I'll run it by him.

24:04.235 --> 24:05.750
For real though, I'll shoot your ass

24:05.750 --> 24:07.883
my motherfucking self, my nigga.

24:07.883 --> 24:09.234
I got you started, you
turn to a motherfucking

24:09.234 --> 24:10.948
janky promoter on me?

24:10.948 --> 24:13.889
- Y'all ain't messing
with no janky promoter.

24:13.889 --> 24:15.142
- Then I hear you, I tell you what.

24:15.142 --> 24:18.918
If you're lucky, I'll see you there.

24:18.918 --> 24:19.877
- Alright.

24:19.877 --> 24:22.086
- That don't mean you
come out of hiding though.

24:22.086 --> 24:23.556
- That mess don't hide, bro.

25:17.122 --> 25:19.515
- It's like he don't care
about anything anymore.

25:19.515 --> 25:21.932
Not me, not our relationship.

25:22.912 --> 25:25.732
- Girl, he is something else.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.748
But one thing I can say is that

25:27.748 --> 25:30.502
deep down inside, that
boy really does care.

25:30.502 --> 25:33.207
Maybe sometimes a little bit too much.

25:33.207 --> 25:34.264
- I don't know.
- But I mean,

25:34.264 --> 25:35.449
you a strong sister.

25:35.449 --> 25:37.498
One of the strongest girls I know.

25:37.498 --> 25:41.493
- Getting up to go to work
every morning, that's strong.

25:41.493 --> 25:45.106
Going shopping, buying
cars, that's not strong.

25:45.106 --> 25:46.228
When you love somebody so much

25:46.228 --> 25:49.030
that your whole being is just like

25:49.030 --> 25:51.706
attached to them and your
mind, your body, your soul...

25:51.706 --> 25:54.769
- Some feelings, some
feelings are like drugs.

25:54.769 --> 25:56.392
They can bring you to your highest high,

25:56.392 --> 25:59.359
but then have your whole world
come crashing down on you.

25:59.359 --> 26:01.491
- That's exactly how I feel.

26:01.491 --> 26:04.329
Like a fucking crack head.

26:04.329 --> 26:05.521
- Ever since Kenny died,

26:05.521 --> 26:08.293
Rilla has been a totally different person.

26:08.293 --> 26:09.200
You know how he used to be

26:09.200 --> 26:10.520
when Kenny used to perform?

26:10.520 --> 26:14.559
Flying the family out to
Cali, first class, and shit.

26:14.559 --> 26:17.978
- Yeah, we was like
celebrities or something.

26:17.978 --> 26:20.166
Back when things was good.
- Yeah.

26:20.166 --> 26:23.268
Well, Kenny had just got the confirmation

26:23.268 --> 26:25.429
that he was supposed
to perform on "Turnt."

26:25.429 --> 26:28.218
They set him up with
some distribution deal.

26:28.218 --> 26:31.386
The first person he wanted to
call and tell was Labareis.

26:31.386 --> 26:34.562
Called him all morning, but
he never even picked up.

26:34.562 --> 26:35.395
- Wait.

26:37.194 --> 26:38.795
I didn't know that.

26:38.795 --> 26:42.838
That's probably why Labareis
feels so responsible.

26:42.838 --> 26:43.671
God.

26:45.378 --> 26:48.810
- It's been really,
really hard since then.

26:48.810 --> 26:51.072
You know how close me and Rilla was.

26:51.072 --> 26:52.308
I know he could be a asshole.

26:52.308 --> 26:54.324
He ain't a rapper and gangster.

26:54.324 --> 26:55.890
He a gangster that really rap.

26:55.890 --> 26:57.426
- Well, he gonna make me stop listening

26:57.426 --> 26:59.027
to rap music, period.

26:59.027 --> 27:00.030
- What?

27:00.030 --> 27:01.254
- Especially his music.

27:01.254 --> 27:03.282
Like, his new song "Used To Be,"

27:03.282 --> 27:05.526
I think that's about us.

27:05.526 --> 27:07.541
- Like I said, that is my brother.

27:07.541 --> 27:09.587
But if you feel like you
want to deal with his shit

27:09.587 --> 27:11.184
in some type of love relapse,

27:11.184 --> 27:13.030
I mean, I'm just going to respect that,

27:13.030 --> 27:15.885
but just know, accepting
the residue of the drug,

27:15.885 --> 27:18.612
is gonna make you a desperate woman.

27:18.612 --> 27:20.376
- Girl, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

27:20.376 --> 27:22.258
I got so many different emotions.

27:22.258 --> 27:25.674
I just wish I could have
what you and Cortney have.

27:25.674 --> 27:27.156
- Girl, girl.

27:27.156 --> 27:29.739
I did six months in love rehab.

27:30.935 --> 27:33.180
- What, really?
- Yeah.

27:33.180 --> 27:35.723
Child, I was something
like a crack head, too.

27:35.723 --> 27:39.694
- Oh my god.

27:39.694 --> 27:41.247
- Hold on, I got something for you.

27:41.247 --> 27:42.532
Wait, let me see if you remember.

27:42.532 --> 27:44.248
- Let me see.
- You remember?

27:47.497 --> 27:49.345
You remember when Kenny performed this?

27:49.345 --> 27:50.815
- Girl, yes!
- I mean that guy.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.593
- Oh you better.

28:00.650 --> 28:02.220
We love you Kenny.
- We love you.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
- Cuz, what's going on, man?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.095
- What's up god daughter?

28:20.222 --> 28:21.346
- Oh my gosh, I'm in Atlanta

28:21.346 --> 28:23.375
looking for my favorite cousin.

28:23.375 --> 28:27.449
I'm actually just checking
into the hotel room.

28:27.449 --> 28:29.200
- Oh okay okay.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.419
Well shit, which one are you at?

28:30.419 --> 28:31.252
I'm gonna come too.

28:31.252 --> 28:32.170
- Oh alright that's what's up.

28:32.170 --> 28:34.463
I'm at the Franklin, I'm in room 1015.

28:34.463 --> 28:35.335
Hurry up because I got something

28:35.335 --> 28:37.728
I want to show you anyway.

28:37.728 --> 28:38.948
- Alright cool, just let me take this

28:38.948 --> 28:40.913
fool real quick.
- Oh my God.

28:40.913 --> 28:42.397
You gotta be the sweetest guy I know.

28:42.397 --> 28:44.587
Tell my cousin I said what's up.

28:44.587 --> 28:45.420
- Will do.

28:45.420 --> 28:46.253
I'll see you in a minute.

28:46.253 --> 28:48.339
- Alright okay, see you soon.

28:48.339 --> 28:49.672
- Bye.
- Bye cuz.

28:53.648 --> 28:56.305
- Get your bitch ass up.

28:56.305 --> 28:57.305
Fuck, nigga.

29:03.252 --> 29:04.752
Who did it, nigga?

29:06.900 --> 29:07.733
This bitch ass nigga.

29:07.733 --> 29:09.585
Man, he knows something.
- Wait a minute.

29:09.585 --> 29:11.106
Wait a minute!
- Answer, motherfucker.

29:11.106 --> 29:12.439
- Wait a minute.

29:14.735 --> 29:16.735
- Get your bitch ass up.

29:19.554 --> 29:20.692
- No!

29:20.692 --> 29:22.109
Wait, wait, wait.

29:25.142 --> 29:27.107
- Hold up hold up hold up, man.

29:27.107 --> 29:27.940
Rilla nigga, hold up.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.607
Put that shit nigga.

29:34.180 --> 29:37.180
Man this fucking nigga killed Kenny.

29:48.565 --> 29:50.148
- Why are you here?

29:52.699 --> 29:54.835
Why are you here man?

29:54.835 --> 29:55.668
- Okay.

29:57.691 --> 30:02.191
I know who did it.

30:05.030 --> 30:07.789
- I know this bum
ass nigga didn't kill Kenny.

30:07.789 --> 30:09.505
But fuck it.

30:09.505 --> 30:11.446
I'm about to send a message,

30:11.446 --> 30:14.761
'til I find out the nigga that did.

30:32.533 --> 30:35.343
- What's up, Cuz, what's up?

30:35.343 --> 30:36.361
- What's up?

30:36.361 --> 30:37.455
- How are you?

30:37.455 --> 30:40.046
Oh my gosh, I missed you.
- Yeah baby.

30:42.488 --> 30:45.138
- Oh, I smell something good for a change.

30:45.138 --> 30:46.365
What you got on?

30:46.365 --> 30:47.619
- That's some puffy shit,

30:47.619 --> 30:48.956
you know what I mean?
- Oh my gosh.

30:48.956 --> 30:49.789
There you go.

30:49.789 --> 30:50.919
It smells good though.

30:50.919 --> 30:52.965
- Yeah, it's straight, it's straight.

30:52.965 --> 30:55.257
So tell me, where the
hell have you been at?

30:55.257 --> 30:56.177
- I've been in Cali.

30:56.177 --> 30:57.335
I thought it was gonna be permanent,

30:57.335 --> 31:00.388
but looks like I'll be moving
to Miami in three weeks.

31:00.388 --> 31:01.560
- Damn, so you only here 'til then?

31:01.560 --> 31:02.403
- Yeah, just until then.

31:02.403 --> 31:04.597
You know, I'm gonna be doing some PR work.

31:04.597 --> 31:05.786
- Okay.
- And I got a big deal

31:05.786 --> 31:07.548
or whatever so they're gonna fly us out.

31:07.548 --> 31:09.576
Yeah we got a big first project coming up,

31:09.576 --> 31:10.802
so I'm so excited.

31:10.802 --> 31:12.518
- Oh okay okay that's cool.

31:12.518 --> 31:13.351
- Yeah.

31:14.611 --> 31:15.997
- Huh.
- What?

31:15.997 --> 31:16.830
Where are you going?

31:16.830 --> 31:18.093
What you thinking about?

31:18.093 --> 31:19.693
- No I don't, look, look, look look.

31:19.693 --> 31:20.535
It ain't nothing really,

31:20.535 --> 31:22.678
it's just bittersweet to me.
- Yeah.

31:22.678 --> 31:23.511
- You know what I'm saying?

31:23.511 --> 31:24.904
I'm happy for my Cuz, your success,

31:24.904 --> 31:26.607
but I get to thinking about this

31:26.607 --> 31:27.958
whole Kenny situation.
- I know.

31:27.958 --> 31:29.326
It makes me sad too, it really does,

31:29.326 --> 31:30.730
and I think about what happened to him.

31:30.730 --> 31:32.794
He was so hot.
- Yeah.

31:32.794 --> 31:33.697
- Man he was so hot.

31:33.697 --> 31:35.926
I'm not saying that my artist
isn't, I'm not saying that.

31:35.926 --> 31:37.113
- Look, listen.

31:37.113 --> 31:39.526
It's on top of that, he listened.

31:39.526 --> 31:41.536
- Yeah, he did.
- You know what I mean?

31:41.536 --> 31:43.948
He had all his ducks set in a row,

31:43.948 --> 31:46.390
plus, you know that show "Turnt?"

31:46.390 --> 31:48.238
- Yeah.
- He was about to be on it.

31:48.238 --> 31:49.456
- I know.
- Yeah but see,

31:49.456 --> 31:52.330
what fucked me up is we
live in a time right now

31:52.330 --> 31:54.987
that young black men, we get killed.

31:54.987 --> 31:56.849
You know what I mean?

31:56.849 --> 31:58.696
It's cool to kill us, no excuse.

31:58.696 --> 31:59.986
- Yeah, you ain't never lied.

31:59.986 --> 32:01.059
- You know what I'm saying?

32:01.059 --> 32:03.237
Then on top of all that,

32:03.237 --> 32:05.625
I had to deal with Rilla.

32:05.625 --> 32:07.899
- Labareis.
- Right, so you know.

32:07.899 --> 32:10.394
- Oh that's a mean
motherfucker right there.

32:10.394 --> 32:11.227
- Word.
- He takes care

32:11.227 --> 32:12.440
of his people, though.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.402
- Yeah, he do.

32:14.402 --> 32:15.619
He the realest, no doubt.

32:15.619 --> 32:17.717
But his problem is he
think that street shit

32:17.717 --> 32:19.568
gonna get us to the top.
- Yeah.

32:19.568 --> 32:20.522
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

32:20.522 --> 32:22.010
- He don't even want
no fucking publishing.

32:22.010 --> 32:23.330
- He don't want no publishing?
- Yeah, I told him.

32:23.330 --> 32:24.650
Ain't no doorways in the street,

32:24.650 --> 32:26.084
and ain't nobody gonna open no door

32:26.084 --> 32:27.816
for people on the street.
- No.

32:27.816 --> 32:29.115
- Right?
- Yeah, that's crazy.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.698
- Right.
- So you talked to him?

32:34.457 --> 32:36.166
I mean, I'm just saying, you know.

32:36.166 --> 32:39.070
- I talk to him every motherfucking day.

32:39.070 --> 32:41.443
I even got on the court,
bet him on the side.

32:41.443 --> 32:42.600
- No.
- Guess where at.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.073
- No, don't even say.
- Lavanderia.

32:44.073 --> 32:46.073
- Get out of here.
- Yep.

32:47.157 --> 32:48.967
- Dang, I wish we were kids again.

32:48.967 --> 32:49.800
- Yeah.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.486
- I used to whoop your ass on that court.

32:52.486 --> 32:54.319
- What?
- Oh, I didn't?

32:55.240 --> 32:57.172
Yeah, well you had a jumper, though.

32:57.172 --> 32:58.009
I will give you that.

32:58.009 --> 32:59.812
- Look, I still got the
motherfucking jumper.

32:59.812 --> 33:00.850
- No you don't, no you don't.
- Listen listen listen listen.

33:00.850 --> 33:02.352
Fuck all that.

33:02.352 --> 33:05.571
All I'm saying is Kenny is dope.

33:05.571 --> 33:06.711
- Yeah.
- But Rilla two times

33:06.711 --> 33:07.763
doper than him.
- I know.

33:07.763 --> 33:10.011
But it wasn't his dream.

33:10.011 --> 33:13.144
- Okay, well, I get that.
- Yeah.

33:13.144 --> 33:15.158
- So if he die, the dream die,

33:15.158 --> 33:17.430
and Kenny die with him, right?

33:17.430 --> 33:19.000
- I mean, I don't know.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.932
I'll talk to him.

33:20.932 --> 33:23.145
- I don't think he gonna listen.

33:23.145 --> 33:24.496
Listen, want to hear something funny?

33:24.496 --> 33:25.329
- What?

33:25.329 --> 33:26.934
- I told this nigga

33:26.934 --> 33:28.517
that we need a EPK.

33:29.380 --> 33:30.220
You know what that is right?

33:30.220 --> 33:31.426
Guess what he said.
- What?

33:31.426 --> 33:33.702
- Nigga, ain't no problem
with my motherfucking heart.

33:33.702 --> 33:34.955
- No he didn't.
- Yes he did.

33:34.955 --> 33:36.026
- No he didn't!

33:36.026 --> 33:37.713
He thought you were talking about a EKG.

33:37.713 --> 33:39.328
Get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:39.328 --> 33:40.666
No books, Google, nothing.

33:40.666 --> 33:42.628
He just tripping.

33:42.628 --> 33:44.595
- That nigga Labareis, that's crazy.

33:44.595 --> 33:45.633
Well, check it out.

33:45.633 --> 33:46.738
You taught me everything I know, though.

33:46.738 --> 33:48.291
- Right.
- So at the end of the day,

33:48.291 --> 33:50.826
we just need to make it his dream too.

33:50.826 --> 33:51.966
- Okay, I'll tell you what.

33:51.966 --> 33:53.650
We got a show at Blue Ivy.

33:53.650 --> 33:55.693
It takes a couple days,
might even be tomorrow.

33:55.693 --> 33:57.826
You could just talk to anyone.

33:57.826 --> 33:58.847
- Yeah.
- Cool?

33:58.847 --> 34:00.068
- That'll be good.
- Alright.

34:00.068 --> 34:01.322
- Is Desi gonna be there?

34:01.322 --> 34:02.924
- Oh man.

34:02.924 --> 34:05.328
Desi ain't been to no
shows since, you know.

34:05.328 --> 34:06.687
She's going through all that, whatnot.

34:06.687 --> 34:07.922
- Oh man.
- But look.

34:07.922 --> 34:10.216
She do got a new number though.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.752
You know what I'm saying.
- She has a new number?

34:11.752 --> 34:12.922
- Yeah.
- Why haven't given,

34:12.922 --> 34:14.788
why don't I have it?
- I'm about to give it to you.

34:14.788 --> 34:15.861
Listen.
- Why don't I have it?

34:15.861 --> 34:17.076
- Hold up hold up hold up.

34:17.076 --> 34:17.909
You getting a pen?
- Yeah.

34:17.909 --> 34:19.933
- Okay look, guess what
happened the last 10 years.

34:19.933 --> 34:20.766
- What?

34:20.766 --> 34:21.599
A pen.
- We text now.

34:21.599 --> 34:22.432
I'm gonna text you.

34:22.432 --> 34:23.403
- No, oh my god, you're funny, okay.

34:23.403 --> 34:24.622
- Yeah, I'll text you.
- Well text it to me

34:24.622 --> 34:25.458
before you forget.

34:25.458 --> 34:26.470
- No I'm gonna do it right now.

34:26.470 --> 34:28.432
- Oh listen, we need to go by the court.

34:28.432 --> 34:30.663
I could whoop that ass again.

34:30.663 --> 34:33.664
Or are you too scared, you chicken?

34:33.664 --> 34:34.900
- On that note.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.502
I will see your ass tomorrow.

34:36.502 --> 34:37.888
- Alright, whatever.
- You remember where it's at?

34:37.888 --> 34:38.726
- Well yeah I remember.

34:38.726 --> 34:39.996
How could I forget?

34:39.996 --> 34:42.213
- Alright, I love you.
- Love you.

34:55.213 --> 34:56.162
- You never get mad.

34:56.162 --> 34:57.452
I have a meeting this afternoon

34:57.452 --> 34:58.970
with a couple big wigs.
- Do you?

34:58.970 --> 35:00.273
- Yeah.
- Well that's exciting.

35:00.273 --> 35:02.385
Do you like it here?
- Yeah I love it.

35:02.385 --> 35:04.862
- Oh my gosh, I'm so
excited to see you guys.

35:04.862 --> 35:07.698
Always so busy, so I never
have down time, you know?

35:07.698 --> 35:08.919
- Yeah.
- I don't have any

35:08.919 --> 35:10.321
family in Cali, so.

35:10.321 --> 35:12.170
- Well, Cortney said
you was going to Miami.

35:12.170 --> 35:13.952
- He told you that I was going to Miami?

35:13.952 --> 35:16.818
Geeze, I still see he
tells you everything.

35:16.818 --> 35:17.942
Gosh, I am though.

35:17.942 --> 35:19.873
That's where I'm gonna lay my hat.

35:19.873 --> 35:21.080
- What you mean lay your hat?

35:21.080 --> 35:22.959
- Yeah I'm a realist, some don't like it.

35:22.959 --> 35:24.248
Yeah.

35:24.248 --> 35:25.881
That's the good thing about
the business though, you know.

35:25.881 --> 35:28.292
Like all the major states
with the most influence.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.021
I wouldn't mind living in those places.

35:30.021 --> 35:31.376
- You know what, you're right.

35:31.376 --> 35:32.547
I never really thought about it like that.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.905
New York, Cali, LA.

35:34.905 --> 35:37.743
It might be interesting.
- Yeah it should be fun.

35:37.743 --> 35:40.797
So look, I was so excited
to see Cort last night

35:40.797 --> 35:44.000
that I forgot to show him this.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.775
Okay, it's the last copy and
I think you should have it.

35:47.775 --> 35:49.953
- Oh my God.

35:49.953 --> 35:52.184
This is back when Cortney was in the game

35:52.184 --> 35:53.487
and he went to Kenny's school.

35:53.487 --> 35:54.639
- Yes!
- He autographed it for him.

35:54.639 --> 35:55.925
- Is that not crazy I saved it?

35:55.925 --> 35:58.256
- Oh my God, Tanya, he's
gonna be so excited.

35:58.256 --> 36:00.051
- Look.

36:00.051 --> 36:02.528
Oh man.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.508
- Miss Stanford,
your meeting's here.

36:04.508 --> 36:06.317
- Give me a second please.

36:06.317 --> 36:08.037
- Oh.
- I love you girl.

36:08.037 --> 36:08.948
- You've got to go already.

36:08.948 --> 36:10.181
I'm happy for you too though.

36:10.181 --> 36:11.980
But check it out, I'm
supposed to meet Cort later,

36:11.980 --> 36:13.779
but he'll probably chicken out, you know.

36:13.779 --> 36:15.020
I always cross him on the court.

36:15.020 --> 36:16.850
I'm pretty sure he don't
want to get showed out.

36:16.850 --> 36:21.651
So, if he doesn't show up,
will you give him this?

36:21.651 --> 36:22.821
- Yeah, I got you.
- Alright thank you.

36:22.821 --> 36:24.770
- Donyale was my first cousin.

36:24.770 --> 36:26.405
She handled all the publishing

36:26.405 --> 36:28.205
of some of the biggest names out there.

36:28.205 --> 36:31.175
So I thought it was a good
idea that she talked to Rilla.

36:31.175 --> 36:34.571
But unfortunately, my
backup plan didn't work.

36:34.571 --> 36:36.917
She just gave Des her acceptance letter

36:36.917 --> 36:39.293
from this big company out in London.

36:39.293 --> 36:40.758
She leaving tomorrow.

36:40.758 --> 36:43.120
And she didn't want to tell me to my face.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.527
Hope I see her again.

37:16.019 --> 37:18.431
- I never know
what Rilla gonna do,

37:18.431 --> 37:20.032
but I did get the call from Donyale

37:20.032 --> 37:21.797
we got his paperwork straight.

37:21.797 --> 37:23.165
So let's see what the night brings.

37:29.351 --> 37:30.866
- I ain't gonna lie.

37:30.866 --> 37:34.205
I was shocked that Rilla
accepted the offer from Kevin.

37:34.205 --> 37:38.807
You know that promoter that
I was telling you all about?

37:38.807 --> 37:40.871
Look like he having fun.

37:40.871 --> 37:44.021
Rocking the crowd, people know his song.

37:44.021 --> 37:46.774
Really remind me of Kenny.

37:46.774 --> 37:48.509
But still though.

37:48.509 --> 37:50.788
Something don't feel right.

38:01.049 --> 38:02.466
- See y'all soon!

38:44.328 --> 38:46.884
- See, I ain't
never been a street dude.

38:46.884 --> 38:48.221
But I understand her.

38:48.221 --> 38:51.091
I also understand to
be a real street dude,

38:51.091 --> 38:53.321
you got to be a killer.

38:53.321 --> 38:55.449
Even if you ain't one.

38:55.449 --> 38:59.543
See, last thing you need is the whole hood

38:59.543 --> 39:01.408
to think you soft.

39:01.408 --> 39:03.652
So even if you ain't a killer,

39:03.652 --> 39:05.399
you gotta be a killer.

39:05.399 --> 39:08.066
And forgiveness, in the streets?

39:09.077 --> 39:11.027
Man, that's for God.

39:11.027 --> 39:13.156
It's otherwise just an emotion

39:13.156 --> 39:15.823
that'll drive hate, anger, rage,

39:17.393 --> 39:19.439
and of course revenge.

39:19.439 --> 39:21.274
Step on a man's pride,

39:21.274 --> 39:23.087
that will get your ass killed.

39:23.087 --> 39:25.811
Especially when you're dealing
with a killer's killer.

39:25.811 --> 39:27.293
- Where's my motherfucking 25,000?

39:27.293 --> 39:28.763
- My Nigga, yeah, what's up?

39:28.763 --> 39:29.885
- My nigga.
- What's up, you got it?

39:29.885 --> 39:30.807
- My nigga.
- You ain't got it?

39:30.807 --> 39:34.355
- My nigga!

40:02.938 --> 40:04.287
- I was telling Zina to shoot up

40:04.287 --> 40:06.321
the motherfucking house.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.461
She done shot up the wrong house.

40:08.461 --> 40:10.752
She seen a white Escalade and went crazy.

40:12.789 --> 40:14.835
Then I hear this nigga Meko.

40:14.835 --> 40:16.085
Looking for me.

40:17.636 --> 40:20.063
- I'm not sure you want to
come at that man like that.

40:20.063 --> 40:21.550
- Whatever, listen.

40:21.550 --> 40:24.370
All I need you to do is
see how his clock ticking.

40:24.370 --> 40:26.253
And besides, you need to take your ass

40:26.253 --> 40:27.751
to the gym, anyway.

40:27.751 --> 40:30.112
Or better yet, why don't
you come over to my gym?

40:30.112 --> 40:32.457
- Fuck you, Meko.

40:48.099 --> 40:51.892
- Trying to keep
my mind off my brother.

40:51.892 --> 40:55.392
So I'm like my brother, I'm in the studio.

40:56.328 --> 40:57.161
Shit.

40:58.607 --> 41:01.744
Meko sent his sister around to be nosy.

41:01.744 --> 41:02.577
She know how it is.

41:02.577 --> 41:04.085
Killers don't talk.

41:04.085 --> 41:07.041
I'm gonna fuck this bitch.

41:07.041 --> 41:08.598
Then I'm gonna kill her myself.

41:11.485 --> 41:14.343
- That hoe ass nigga put his sister on me.

41:14.343 --> 41:16.843
Huh, he put her in harm's way.

41:18.796 --> 41:20.429
This my city.

41:20.429 --> 41:22.756
- I've been out all fucking day,

41:22.756 --> 41:24.142
trying to book Rilla for shows.

41:24.142 --> 41:27.178
But don't nobody want him
'cause he out here wildin'.

41:27.178 --> 41:29.981
I swear to god this rap
shit is hard as fuck.

41:29.981 --> 41:33.316
I'm about to find me a
pop star or something.

41:33.316 --> 41:35.657
That nigga don't listen to shit.

41:35.657 --> 41:36.490
But I tell you what,

41:36.490 --> 41:39.142
I love the shit out of his sister though.

41:39.142 --> 41:42.442
Damn, this nigga about
to throw everything away.

41:42.442 --> 41:43.275
Man.

41:45.183 --> 41:47.766
That nigga stupid as fuck, man.

41:54.027 --> 41:55.629
Dang.

41:55.629 --> 41:56.462
Oh well.

41:57.710 --> 42:01.207
I'm about to get it in.

42:01.207 --> 42:02.040
Okay.

42:14.838 --> 42:17.285
- The best thing about being with Desiree

42:17.285 --> 42:19.646
is she's like my best friend.

42:19.646 --> 42:22.057
We've been together since high school.

42:22.057 --> 42:24.499
A lot of people think we married.

42:24.499 --> 42:27.751
I mean, they call that common law.

42:27.751 --> 42:31.279
But I'm gonna go ahead and
make it official this year.

42:31.279 --> 42:33.886
'Cause she got everything I need.

42:59.791 --> 43:00.624
- Cort.

43:02.084 --> 43:03.251
Cortney, Cort.

43:04.196 --> 43:06.113
Somebody's at the door.

43:07.183 --> 43:08.305
- What?

43:08.305 --> 43:09.397
- Somebody's at the door.

43:09.397 --> 43:11.314
Who do you think it is?

43:12.446 --> 43:14.905
- It's probably your damn brother.

43:41.566 --> 43:42.559
Who the fuck is it?

43:42.559 --> 43:43.414
- It's the police.

43:43.414 --> 43:44.914
We have a warrant.

43:46.487 --> 43:48.627
- Babe, who do you think it is?

43:48.627 --> 43:49.460
- I'm here with you.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.738
How the fuck am I supposed to know?

43:51.738 --> 43:53.911
Oh shit, it is the police.

43:53.911 --> 43:57.313
- Mr. Thomas, if you don't
open this door in five seconds,

43:57.313 --> 43:59.583
we're gonna bust it down.

44:06.665 --> 44:08.034
- Cortney Thomas, you're under arrest

44:08.034 --> 44:10.166
for the murder of Kevin Banks.

44:10.166 --> 44:11.437
- I don't know a Kevin Banks.

44:11.437 --> 44:12.325
- Wait lover boy.

44:12.325 --> 44:13.993
Let me see a warrant.

44:13.993 --> 44:15.577
Where's the warrant?

44:15.577 --> 44:17.161
- This doesn't concern you, ma'am.

44:17.161 --> 44:18.613
- He is my only concern.

44:18.613 --> 44:20.707
- Great, he's going to need it.

44:20.707 --> 44:22.540
- Whatever.
- Let's go.

44:23.597 --> 44:25.081
- Hey, go back to bed.

44:25.081 --> 44:26.599
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

44:26.599 --> 44:29.851
- I love you.
- I love you too baby.

45:05.390 --> 45:06.267
- She there?

45:06.267 --> 45:07.471
- Of course she's here.

45:07.471 --> 45:09.520
It's her class.

45:09.520 --> 45:11.149
I'll call you later.
- Are you having fun?

45:11.149 --> 45:13.477
- You're the one that
said I needed to work out.

45:13.477 --> 45:14.490
Bye.

45:14.490 --> 45:16.067
- So Meko got his little sister

45:16.067 --> 45:18.727
to follow Ladonna around.

45:18.727 --> 45:20.964
To try to get at Rilla.

45:20.964 --> 45:22.979
But Rilla was already up on it.

45:24.726 --> 45:27.879
See, Rilla don't put up with nothing.

45:27.879 --> 45:30.380
But when it comes to Ladonna,

45:30.380 --> 45:32.830
man, that's the wrong move.

45:32.830 --> 45:35.497
And Meko should have known that.

45:36.453 --> 45:39.200
But it's hard for Ladonna to see that.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.931
'Cause all she see is hurt.

46:09.213 --> 46:10.587
- Dad!
- How are you?

46:10.587 --> 46:11.809
- Oh my god.
- What's going on?

46:11.809 --> 46:13.369
- How did you know where I was?

46:13.369 --> 46:16.887
- Listen, all I gotta do is
put in location, then I'm here.

46:16.887 --> 46:18.220
So.
- Well, okay.

46:19.337 --> 46:23.029
So Meko, this is my dad, and
this Tasha, my best friend.

46:23.029 --> 46:24.237
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, pleasure.

46:24.237 --> 46:25.460
So how you doing?

46:25.460 --> 46:27.387
How's my little superstar
in Hollywood doing?

46:27.387 --> 46:29.450
You know, I like this.
- I'm so excited.

46:29.450 --> 46:32.075
But I'm here for like another three hours,

46:32.075 --> 46:34.859
so I don't know if you want to
wait, grab dinner later, or.

46:34.859 --> 46:35.806
- No, dinner's cool.

46:38.569 --> 46:39.987
Alright, dinner's okay.

46:39.987 --> 46:41.159
Definitely I'm with it.

46:41.159 --> 46:43.086
And maybe after that,
you can show me around,

46:43.086 --> 46:45.669
but I don't think I could stay.

46:47.178 --> 46:48.734
I might get in trouble a bit.

46:48.734 --> 46:50.539
- Dad, you are too much.
- Hey.

46:50.539 --> 46:54.580
- But I could possibly leave
one of my shoots early,

46:54.580 --> 46:56.035
if I need to.
- No no no.

46:56.035 --> 46:58.430
I don't want you to lose no money over me.

46:58.430 --> 47:00.795
But look, I gotta get to the studio now,

47:00.795 --> 47:03.679
but I'm gonna be here four hours longer.

47:03.679 --> 47:05.519
- Let's get this party started.

47:05.519 --> 47:06.956
- Oh yeah yeah yeah, it's definitely time

47:06.956 --> 47:08.076
for me to get up out of here.

47:08.076 --> 47:09.193
Listen baby girl, I'll
see you later, alright?

47:23.600 --> 47:25.441
- Evelyn Chambers.

47:25.441 --> 47:26.772
There's only file on my table

47:26.772 --> 47:29.609
that would've brought you here.

47:29.609 --> 47:32.269
- Well, if I only take the easy cases,

47:32.269 --> 47:35.559
then it wouldn't be no fun now, would it?

47:35.559 --> 47:38.130
- This one's not gonna be easy.

47:38.130 --> 47:40.367
You've got three murders,

47:40.367 --> 47:41.647
two more attempted murders,

47:41.647 --> 47:46.231
and not to mention with
fully automatic weapons.

47:46.231 --> 47:47.669
- What we both need to do

47:47.669 --> 47:51.167
is get the person or persons
off the street that did this.

47:51.167 --> 47:52.161
The frame of mind that did this

47:52.161 --> 47:54.459
is not the frame of
mind of Cortney Thomas.

47:54.459 --> 47:56.626
My client is a family man.

47:57.800 --> 48:00.107
- Your family threatened the victim,

48:00.107 --> 48:02.241
to blow his brains out just days before.

48:02.241 --> 48:05.430
- Shoot your ass my
motherfucking self, my nigga.

48:08.702 --> 48:09.535
- Evelyn.

48:11.712 --> 48:15.462
Your client was brought
in on murder charges.

48:16.380 --> 48:18.343
You know the process.

48:18.343 --> 48:20.689
I'm gonna have to recommend for no bail

48:20.689 --> 48:21.843
first thing in the morning.

48:21.843 --> 48:24.102
- Cortney is married to Stanford's sister,

48:24.102 --> 48:25.730
and is also his manager.

48:25.730 --> 48:28.339
He is also the manager of
Stanford's little brother.

48:28.339 --> 48:29.839
His name is Kenny.

48:30.929 --> 48:33.813
- You mean the kid who was
murdered earlier this year?

48:33.813 --> 48:35.967
- Yes, and Detective Kruthers was also

48:35.967 --> 48:39.273
in the club that night
unofficially watching Stanford.

48:39.273 --> 48:40.777
- Unofficially?

48:40.777 --> 48:42.232
- He's seen my client leaving the club

48:42.232 --> 48:43.753
30 minutes before the murder.
- That's new, then.

48:43.753 --> 48:46.819
200 people in a club
and nobody came forward?

48:46.819 --> 48:50.388
- Dmitri, the man has the
whole town scared of him.

48:55.947 --> 48:57.949
- Luckily my girl is a lawyer,

48:57.949 --> 48:59.942
and she got friends that's lawyers.

48:59.942 --> 49:03.275
Hollered at the DA, dropped all charges.

49:10.229 --> 49:12.929
His mama asked him to
carry on Kenny's dream,

49:12.929 --> 49:15.430
but he'd rather going
around killing niggas.

49:15.430 --> 49:17.180
Man, he on his own.

49:17.180 --> 49:20.013
I'm about to find me a new artist.

49:21.590 --> 49:22.737
Then I'm gonna go see him.

49:27.126 --> 49:29.735
- Remember I told
y'all about Rita Robinson?

49:29.735 --> 49:31.402
Well she's the shit.

49:33.886 --> 49:36.219
But all she do is make hits.

49:37.138 --> 49:39.486
All her artists is popping.

49:39.486 --> 49:41.569
They got number one hits.

49:45.786 --> 49:48.968
- They living their best life.

49:48.968 --> 49:51.418
And the best part about it,

49:51.418 --> 49:53.001
is they all female.

49:59.244 --> 50:02.494
- Wow, so this is where it all started?

50:04.088 --> 50:07.434
Only female exec in the game,
known all over the world.

50:07.434 --> 50:09.968
- You know, sometimes
I get in my feelings,

50:09.968 --> 50:13.484
and I think about how we
used to have street teams,

50:13.484 --> 50:15.067
and now we're here.

50:16.408 --> 50:20.258
- Yeah, and God-willing, we'll stay here.

50:20.258 --> 50:21.714
Guess who I spoke to.

50:21.714 --> 50:22.657
- Jesus?

50:22.657 --> 50:25.546
- Really?
- Well you told me guess who.

50:25.546 --> 50:27.034
- Donyale.

50:27.034 --> 50:28.254
- What?

50:28.254 --> 50:29.134
You know that's my girl.

50:29.134 --> 50:30.007
How is she doing?

50:30.007 --> 50:31.075
- She's good.

50:31.075 --> 50:33.418
Just in Miami doing what she do.

50:33.418 --> 50:35.154
- Oh my God, that girl
don't know what she want.

50:35.154 --> 50:37.096
She's in Miami, she's in LA.

50:37.096 --> 50:39.336
I mean, she just all over the place.

50:39.336 --> 50:41.188
- I didn't know she was Cortney's cousin.

50:41.188 --> 50:43.498
She said something about gorilla

50:43.498 --> 50:45.581
is considered marketable?

50:48.321 --> 50:49.154
Really?

50:51.891 --> 50:54.112
- I mean, it's nothing.

50:54.112 --> 50:56.491
I mean, his name is Labareis.

50:56.491 --> 50:58.788
He's a street dude from back home,

50:58.788 --> 51:00.324
and I mean, he wasn't even a rapper

51:00.324 --> 51:03.212
until his brother got murdered.

51:03.212 --> 51:06.152
The streets named him Rilla.

51:06.152 --> 51:09.902
- I did not realize that
was Kenny's brother.

51:11.701 --> 51:14.501
- That's why the industry
is so scared of him.

51:14.501 --> 51:17.750
'Cause he's a killer.

51:21.527 --> 51:22.860
- How you doing?

51:24.226 --> 51:25.297
- I ain't scared of this nigga

51:25.297 --> 51:26.940
like everybody else.

51:26.940 --> 51:28.620
I ain't no snitch, neither.

51:28.620 --> 51:31.228
But he got the police coming
to my motherfucking house

51:31.228 --> 51:32.889
off shit he did?

51:32.889 --> 51:34.290
Fuck this nigga.

51:34.290 --> 51:36.788
He fucking over everybody in his life.

51:36.788 --> 51:39.731
Even his wife Ladonna.

51:41.673 --> 51:42.809
- Fuck you.

51:42.809 --> 51:47.300
- Get the fuck away!

51:47.300 --> 51:48.520
- Man, huh?

51:48.520 --> 51:50.045
Don't you ever do this again.

51:50.045 --> 51:51.201
- Fuck, Cort.

51:51.201 --> 51:52.512
What I look like when niggas

51:52.512 --> 51:54.095
run the ball on me.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.317
He lucky she my sister.

52:06.997 --> 52:07.830
- Fuck!

52:09.258 --> 52:11.340
- What's wrong?

52:11.340 --> 52:12.847
- Everything.

52:12.847 --> 52:14.347
Nothing works.

52:14.347 --> 52:15.400
Trying to get this verse down

52:15.400 --> 52:17.308
with my brother on this track.

52:17.308 --> 52:20.230
I be pushing all the
buttons, mashing everything.

52:20.230 --> 52:21.946
Nothing's working.
- Okay.

52:21.946 --> 52:23.571
Just to be clear, what happened?

52:23.571 --> 52:24.639
- I don't know.

52:24.639 --> 52:26.824
They was like, if this
happens, to push this.

52:26.824 --> 52:29.904
I'm trying to turn the
mids up one way, number 23.

52:29.904 --> 52:31.327
Nothing's coming on.

52:31.327 --> 52:32.994
And he got a hot 16.

52:34.634 --> 52:36.898
I'm trying to get just something.

52:36.898 --> 52:40.065
- Alright alright hold on, let me see.

52:45.930 --> 52:47.495
- Yo!

52:47.495 --> 52:49.860
Rita fucking Robinson.

52:49.860 --> 52:50.995
- What's my motherfucking name?

52:50.995 --> 52:53.080
- Hey, hey!

52:53.080 --> 52:54.657
- This is hot.

52:54.657 --> 52:56.337
What's this called?

52:56.337 --> 52:58.190
- This is my new song.

52:58.190 --> 53:00.940
"30 minutes," a little love jump.

53:02.056 --> 53:05.717
All you really need, all
you need is 30 minutes.

53:05.717 --> 53:06.550
Hey, hey.

53:07.587 --> 53:11.158
A little joint I'm gonna
put out for the streets.

53:11.158 --> 53:12.959
- Yeah, why did you call
it "30 Minutes" though?

53:12.959 --> 53:14.308
- For real?
- Yeah.

53:14.308 --> 53:15.816
- It took me 30 damn minutes

53:15.816 --> 53:17.496
to learn how to work all of this

53:17.496 --> 53:19.579
not working analog stuff.

53:20.926 --> 53:22.956
Who uses analog?

53:22.956 --> 53:24.720
Everything is digital!

53:24.720 --> 53:27.137
Rita, everything!
- That's bad, that's bad.

53:27.137 --> 53:28.990
- We did, little baby.

53:28.990 --> 53:30.319
Y'all got all this money.

53:30.319 --> 53:31.614
Y'all better level up.

53:31.614 --> 53:33.555
- It's classic.
- Better than classic.

53:33.555 --> 53:36.585
This has dinosaur bones.

53:36.585 --> 53:37.987
- It works though, it works.

53:37.987 --> 53:39.070
- Hey, badly.

53:42.972 --> 53:44.889
- It's your man's shit.

53:46.966 --> 53:48.309
But you don't need that nigga.

53:48.309 --> 53:49.677
Fuck Cortney.

53:49.677 --> 53:51.128
- Man fuck that nigga, dog.

53:51.128 --> 53:52.507
That nigga pissed me off, man.

53:52.507 --> 53:53.840
- We're throwing this shit away, man.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.798
We gotta do this shit for Kenny.

53:55.798 --> 53:59.146
Dude done spent like 100
fucking racks and shit, man.

53:59.146 --> 54:00.055
On the studio.

54:00.055 --> 54:02.907
- Unk, you know I don't play
no games in the streets, man.

54:02.907 --> 54:04.657
Alright look, I already got the club.

54:04.657 --> 54:06.787
All the DJ, street team, all that.

54:06.787 --> 54:08.190
I just gotta make the call.

54:08.190 --> 54:09.534
- Make the call, man.

54:09.534 --> 54:10.608
- I'll make the call.

54:10.608 --> 54:12.898
- I ain't changing the name though.

54:12.898 --> 54:13.996
- What's your name?

54:13.996 --> 54:17.565
- It's gonna be "My
Brother's Keeper," man.

54:17.565 --> 54:19.128
It's for Kenny.

54:19.128 --> 54:21.247
- What about that nigga motherfucker Meko?

54:21.247 --> 54:22.838
- Matter fact, you're right.

54:22.838 --> 54:26.317
I gotta fuck that nigga's sister.

54:26.317 --> 54:27.197
Alright, we cool.

54:27.197 --> 54:28.947
Now turn the beat up.

54:40.786 --> 54:43.798
- Like I said, fuck Cortney.

54:43.798 --> 54:45.688
I don't need no motherfucking manager.

54:45.688 --> 54:48.021
I'm gonna do this by myself.

54:49.856 --> 54:52.024
- I put the ink to the paper,

54:52.024 --> 54:55.441
and be the next artist undo Capo Records.

54:57.220 --> 54:58.757
- You Capo?

54:58.757 --> 55:00.126
- Yeah.

55:00.126 --> 55:02.260
All day every day.

55:02.260 --> 55:04.308
Look man, you ready to get to this paper?

55:04.308 --> 55:06.456
- Do me a favor with
all the small talk, man.

55:06.456 --> 55:09.176
How much money are we talking about, dog?

55:09.176 --> 55:11.117
All this shit's cute, but man,

55:11.117 --> 55:12.428
I already got the bags.

55:12.428 --> 55:13.740
- We gonna get straight to it.

55:13.740 --> 55:16.087
I'm gonna get your contract ready today.

55:16.087 --> 55:19.078
I just need to know
ready to ride with Capo.

55:19.078 --> 55:21.197
- Man listen, I got five man.

55:21.197 --> 55:25.676
Plus I got so much unreleased
music for the street.

55:25.676 --> 55:27.039
Come on, man.

55:27.039 --> 55:28.006
What can you do?

55:28.006 --> 55:29.490
- What, what can I do?

55:29.490 --> 55:32.206
Man, we gonna get you larger than life.

55:32.206 --> 55:34.497
And your music gonna
get to all the outlets

55:34.497 --> 55:36.140
out there nationwide.

55:36.140 --> 55:39.448
You'll have access to the
biggest studios in Atlanta,

55:39.448 --> 55:40.655
like real talk.

55:40.655 --> 55:44.120
All you gotta worry about is making hits.

55:44.120 --> 55:45.396
That's all I need you to worry about.

55:45.396 --> 55:46.677
Let me do the rest.

55:46.677 --> 55:48.246
See, I'm gonna need all the masters

55:48.246 --> 55:50.206
to you and your brother's music, though,

55:50.206 --> 55:52.436
'cause I'm gonna sign it
under my publishing company

55:52.436 --> 55:56.108
and I got this girl working
on this hook for you too.

55:56.108 --> 55:57.228
She fire.

55:57.228 --> 55:58.488
- Hey man.

55:58.488 --> 56:00.920
Nigga, what did you just
say about publishing?

56:00.920 --> 56:03.440
You think I'm gonna give
you my brother's music, man?

56:03.440 --> 56:04.966
Publishing and all that shit?

56:04.966 --> 56:06.646
You crazy, man.

56:06.646 --> 56:09.446
What the fuck I look like,
giving you my brother's music?

56:09.446 --> 56:12.295
- We pay for everything and anything.

56:12.295 --> 56:15.057
As long as the contract belongs to me,

56:15.057 --> 56:16.497
you're good my nigga.

56:16.497 --> 56:18.070
- Got me fucked up, man.

56:18.070 --> 56:19.787
- Oh that's how it is?
- We don't do no business

56:19.787 --> 56:20.660
like that man.

56:20.660 --> 56:21.658
I'll put you on contract, man.

56:21.658 --> 56:24.160
- I got 10,000 dollars for you

56:24.160 --> 56:26.437
once you finish the CD.

56:26.437 --> 56:28.484
- Keep that 10,000 man.
- But that's after,

56:28.484 --> 56:31.020
hey, that's after you finish
the full mix tapes too though.

56:31.020 --> 56:32.247
- Fuck about that, got my own.

56:32.247 --> 56:34.940
- So I ain't
seen Rilla since we fought,

56:34.940 --> 56:36.146
but now he get a chance to see

56:36.146 --> 56:38.983
how dirty and crooked
the industry really is.

56:38.983 --> 56:39.858
And me?

56:39.858 --> 56:41.608
I'm just out here doing what I do.

56:41.608 --> 56:43.536
- Hello Cortney.

56:43.536 --> 56:44.586
I've got to go.

56:44.586 --> 56:46.126
- Okay, so you know my name.

56:46.126 --> 56:46.998
What's yours?

56:46.998 --> 56:48.016
- I'm so sorry.

56:48.016 --> 56:49.327
My name's Jade.

56:49.327 --> 56:51.977
And I met you a few years ago.

56:51.977 --> 56:54.761
I was an intern with Donyale.

56:54.761 --> 56:58.210
And I helped with Kenny's publishing.

56:58.210 --> 57:01.360
- Oh, Jade, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

57:01.360 --> 57:02.498
- How you been doing?

57:02.498 --> 57:03.408
- I'm good.

57:03.408 --> 57:06.087
I just started two months
ago as Annette's PA.

57:06.087 --> 57:08.098
So I will be working on "Turnt."

57:08.098 --> 57:10.367
- Wow, that's dope.

57:10.367 --> 57:12.737
Well, coincidentally, I have a dope artist

57:12.737 --> 57:13.960
coming through tonight.

57:13.960 --> 57:15.397
I'm a guest.

57:15.397 --> 57:17.161
- Right this way.

57:26.298 --> 57:27.750
- See music is digital now.

57:27.750 --> 57:31.110
You could put your own music
on every platform out there.

57:31.110 --> 57:34.311
Some rappers believe that the
day of the manager is over.

57:34.311 --> 57:35.590
But then you have other artists

57:35.590 --> 57:39.340
that know exactly how
important managers are.

57:42.277 --> 57:44.270
If you would've asked me a few weeks ago,

57:44.270 --> 57:48.154
I would've told you I was
gonna be in rap my whole life.

57:48.154 --> 57:50.027
But after Kenny getting killed,

57:50.027 --> 57:53.370
and Rilla going around
acting like Suge Knight,

57:53.370 --> 57:54.280
I don't know.

58:01.177 --> 58:03.151
- One more thing.

58:03.151 --> 58:05.830
Remember how I told y'all about Rita?

58:05.830 --> 58:07.141
- Cheers.

58:07.141 --> 58:10.781
- We used to fuck
around back in the day.

58:10.781 --> 58:14.421
She known I'm married, but
she like a street nigga.

58:14.421 --> 58:16.278
And like I said,

58:16.278 --> 58:18.445
she got that golden touch.

58:21.141 --> 58:22.808
And this music shit,

58:24.520 --> 58:26.687
she got that shit on lock.

59:52.655 --> 59:53.832
- It might
sound like I'm hating,

59:53.832 --> 59:56.856
while Rilla out doing whatever he do,

59:56.856 --> 59:58.522
I'm dead serious.

59:58.522 --> 1:00:00.884
I'm about to find me the next pop star,

1:00:00.884 --> 1:00:02.884
rock star, country star.

1:00:03.842 --> 1:00:06.569
Fuck it, maybe even land
the perfect rap group.

1:00:06.569 --> 1:00:09.036
- Look, tell 'em to hurry up.

1:00:09.036 --> 1:00:11.502
It's important to make it here on time.

1:00:11.502 --> 1:00:12.746
Alright?

1:00:12.746 --> 1:00:13.746
I trust you.

1:00:14.776 --> 1:00:18.314
Alright, later.

1:00:18.314 --> 1:00:20.392
- I like to
come to the Oakdale Lounge

1:00:20.392 --> 1:00:22.754
whenever I'm trying to clear my mind.

1:00:22.754 --> 1:00:24.906
Or maybe just to get away.

1:00:24.906 --> 1:00:27.584
Music, it's all the same to me.

1:00:27.584 --> 1:00:29.501
Lyrics on top of beats.

1:00:30.402 --> 1:00:31.902
So I enjoy it all.

1:00:48.514 --> 1:00:50.441
I think everybody come here to relax.

1:00:50.441 --> 1:00:53.292
Or maybe just to have
a nice peaceful time.

1:00:53.292 --> 1:00:54.781
You definitely not
gonna see the club owner

1:00:54.781 --> 1:00:57.142
get shot in front of all of his customers.

1:00:57.142 --> 1:01:01.475
I'm just saying.

1:01:05.992 --> 1:01:06.825
Alright.

1:01:08.876 --> 1:01:09.709
Alright.

1:01:21.425 --> 1:01:22.652
- This is Hunter Watson.

1:01:22.652 --> 1:01:23.684
He's one of the contestants

1:01:23.684 --> 1:01:26.045
that was gonna compete against Kenny.

1:01:26.045 --> 1:01:27.706
But he ended up winning.

1:01:27.706 --> 1:01:29.475
So I came to check him out.

1:01:29.475 --> 1:01:32.308
He wanted me to see him, so I did.

1:01:33.782 --> 1:01:34.762
He's pretty dope.

1:01:45.114 --> 1:01:46.779
- Girl yes, mm-hmm.

1:01:46.779 --> 1:01:48.437
No, I got tired of those dreads.

1:01:48.437 --> 1:01:50.316
I actually cut 'em off the other day.

1:01:50.316 --> 1:01:53.289
I needed something fresh,
I needed something new.

1:01:53.289 --> 1:01:54.122
Mm-hmm.

1:01:55.986 --> 1:01:56.819
Yeah.

1:01:58.237 --> 1:01:59.320
Girl, I know.

1:02:00.938 --> 1:02:01.828
Man, listen.

1:02:01.828 --> 1:02:03.336
She ain't about getting this money.

1:02:03.336 --> 1:02:06.799
I'm over here opening checks right now.

1:02:06.799 --> 1:02:09.879
Oh I'm almost finishing and
the studio is all yours.

1:02:09.879 --> 1:02:12.189
- I'm here to see you.

1:02:12.189 --> 1:02:13.099
- Oh I'm not the engineer,

1:02:13.099 --> 1:02:14.448
but I'm sure somebody can help.

1:02:14.448 --> 1:02:17.108
- Rita Robinson, right?

1:02:17.108 --> 1:02:20.043
- You know what, let
me call you right back.

1:02:21.688 --> 1:02:24.938
Yes, but I'm not taking any more demos.

1:02:25.998 --> 1:02:27.888
- What is this, 1998?

1:02:27.888 --> 1:02:30.805
Motherfuckers ain't making demos no more.

1:02:30.805 --> 1:02:33.800
- Alright, that's great and
everything, but I'm busy,

1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:34.976
and I have to get out of here,

1:02:34.976 --> 1:02:37.599
so what you're gonna do is
have Larry help you, okay?

1:02:37.599 --> 1:02:40.599
- No no no no, you're gonna help me.

1:02:41.973 --> 1:02:44.146
You know that little hoe ass nigga Kenny?

1:02:44.146 --> 1:02:46.018
He got his head blowed off.

1:02:46.018 --> 1:02:48.983
And the same shit's getting
ready to happen to Rilla.

1:02:48.983 --> 1:02:50.566
- You killed Kenny?

1:02:51.949 --> 1:02:53.782
You a bitch ass nigga.

1:02:54.760 --> 1:02:55.916
- Yeah?

1:02:55.916 --> 1:02:59.488
You see, you better respect the shooter,

1:02:59.488 --> 1:03:01.760
or the shooter sure
enough is gonna disrespect

1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:03.427
the shit out of you.

1:03:04.767 --> 1:03:06.850
Besides, Rilla played me.

1:03:08.168 --> 1:03:11.210
He came to me for a record deal first.

1:03:11.210 --> 1:03:12.909
- A record deal?

1:03:12.909 --> 1:03:14.309
- Yeah.

1:03:14.309 --> 1:03:15.559
- That's funny.

1:03:17.610 --> 1:03:20.849
Man nobody don't even know you.

1:03:20.849 --> 1:03:23.841
- Let me tell you something, right?

1:03:23.841 --> 1:03:26.202
I know you're fucking this nigga.

1:03:26.202 --> 1:03:30.869
Don't make me blow your fucking
head off your shoulders.

1:03:31.994 --> 1:03:36.002
This motherfucker, first
he's trapping on my block,

1:03:36.002 --> 1:03:38.872
then he pushes my brother out.

1:03:38.872 --> 1:03:42.180
And then I give him work,
and he throws it away.

1:03:42.180 --> 1:03:43.212
Now you want to walk around here

1:03:43.212 --> 1:03:45.469
like everything's good, huh?

1:03:45.469 --> 1:03:47.709
Like fuck Meko, huh?

1:03:47.709 --> 1:03:49.209
No, he's finished.

1:03:50.282 --> 1:03:53.615
That Biggie Smalls looking motherfucker.

1:03:56.022 --> 1:03:58.647
- He gonna kill your bitch ass.

1:03:58.647 --> 1:04:00.569
- I told you.

1:04:00.569 --> 1:04:02.550
Don't ever call me a bitch.

1:04:02.550 --> 1:04:04.921
And if you ever do again,

1:04:04.921 --> 1:04:06.957
I'm gonna put a bullet in
your motherfucking head

1:04:06.957 --> 1:04:08.540
for real this time.

1:04:09.532 --> 1:04:11.365
Rita fucking Robinson.

1:04:32.492 --> 1:04:33.492
- Hey bitch!

1:04:48.018 --> 1:04:51.900
Rilla, I need you to
get to Atlanta tonight.

1:04:51.900 --> 1:04:53.688
Don't ask me no questions,
just do what I'm

1:04:53.688 --> 1:04:55.997
telling you to do.

1:04:55.997 --> 1:04:58.312
No don't fly commercial, alright?

1:04:58.312 --> 1:05:01.420
I need you to hit up
Bus, and take my check.

1:05:01.420 --> 1:05:02.909
Yeah.

1:05:02.909 --> 1:05:04.678
Just do what I'm telling you to do.

1:05:04.678 --> 1:05:07.179
I need you to listen to me, alright?

1:05:07.179 --> 1:05:09.846
Get home to your wife right now.

1:05:12.168 --> 1:05:13.001
Hello?

1:05:14.268 --> 1:05:15.668
Yeah my name is Rita Robinson,

1:05:15.668 --> 1:05:18.001
and I just shot an intruder.

1:05:19.785 --> 1:05:21.035
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:05:22.948 --> 1:05:24.615
No I don't know him.

1:05:25.888 --> 1:05:27.221
Yeah, he's dead.

1:05:29.038 --> 1:05:29.871
Okay.

1:05:47.952 --> 1:05:49.510
- Dog, tell me why you're on my car.

1:05:49.510 --> 1:05:51.677
- Cortney Cortney Cortney.

1:05:52.560 --> 1:05:54.560
Damn you got good taste.

1:05:55.740 --> 1:05:56.931
You know we need to talk, right?

1:05:56.931 --> 1:05:57.892
- About what?

1:05:57.892 --> 1:05:59.892
- You know me, I'm Tony.

1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:03.386
You might know me as my name,

1:06:03.386 --> 1:06:05.308
but you know me, I'm the detective that,

1:06:05.308 --> 1:06:08.518
the badass detective
that takes down killers.

1:06:08.518 --> 1:06:11.752
You know, hunt 'em down,
get 'em off the streets.

1:06:11.752 --> 1:06:13.417
Pop up here or there.

1:06:13.417 --> 1:06:14.750
- You funny too.

1:06:15.709 --> 1:06:16.542
Hey look.

1:06:17.769 --> 1:06:20.377
What you looking down for?

1:06:20.377 --> 1:06:21.544
I do know you.

1:06:23.074 --> 1:06:24.545
You that crooked ass officer.

1:06:24.545 --> 1:06:27.673
- Detective Kruthers, motherfucker.

1:06:27.673 --> 1:06:29.423
- To tell you the truth,

1:06:29.423 --> 1:06:31.125
I don't give a fuck about your name,

1:06:31.125 --> 1:06:33.763
no murders, no station, no nothing.

1:06:33.763 --> 1:06:35.759
Told the people down
there I don't kill nobody.

1:06:35.759 --> 1:06:37.426
So why are you here?

1:06:38.489 --> 1:06:41.272
- There's three type
of people in the world.

1:06:41.272 --> 1:06:43.006
One that got some to lose,

1:06:43.006 --> 1:06:45.615
one who don't have something to lose,

1:06:45.615 --> 1:06:47.855
and one who just don't give a fuck.

1:06:47.855 --> 1:06:50.037
And I know which one you are.

1:06:50.037 --> 1:06:53.954
I know which one that
the club owner is or was.

1:06:56.495 --> 1:07:00.245
See the word on the street is
that your brother-in-law Rilla

1:07:00.245 --> 1:07:02.676
just don't give a fuck.

1:07:02.676 --> 1:07:05.856
I just don't understand
why he's so concerned with

1:07:05.856 --> 1:07:08.527
keeping his hands clean.

1:07:08.527 --> 1:07:09.360
- Oh.

1:07:10.420 --> 1:07:12.087
You think you slick?

1:07:13.357 --> 1:07:15.740
You ain't that slick man.

1:07:15.740 --> 1:07:16.636
You ain't slick enough to get me

1:07:16.636 --> 1:07:19.137
to start talking like that.

1:07:19.137 --> 1:07:20.899
I just told you I ain't killed nobody.

1:07:20.899 --> 1:07:23.558
Went down to the station,
I told them that.

1:07:23.558 --> 1:07:26.130
Now if you'll excuse
me, you see I gotta go.

1:07:26.130 --> 1:07:27.024
- You know why his hands dirty?

1:07:27.024 --> 1:07:28.496
He whooped your ass, didn't he?

1:07:28.496 --> 1:07:30.316
Yeah, he whooped your ass.
- That's what you heard?

1:07:30.316 --> 1:07:32.847
- I mean, that's what
the streets are saying.

1:07:32.847 --> 1:07:33.989
- Well you heard wrong bro.

1:07:33.989 --> 1:07:35.599
- Okay okay okay.

1:07:35.599 --> 1:07:37.699
You know what I like about you Cortney?

1:07:37.699 --> 1:07:40.028
You know, when we had you in the precinct,

1:07:40.028 --> 1:07:42.249
you didn't run your mouth.

1:07:42.249 --> 1:07:44.749
Could you do just one whisper?

1:07:45.966 --> 1:07:49.116
Well sure that motherfucker will be dead.

1:07:49.116 --> 1:07:50.782
That means your wife
will have two brothers

1:07:50.782 --> 1:07:51.776
killed in one year.

1:07:51.776 --> 1:07:53.862
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah, real fucked up.

1:07:53.862 --> 1:07:56.784
- So, I guess this dumb ass detective

1:07:56.784 --> 1:07:58.254
figure he can come to me,

1:07:58.254 --> 1:07:59.916
and get me the snitch.

1:07:59.916 --> 1:08:02.646
Or be scared of him and
tell him where Rilla is at.

1:08:02.646 --> 1:08:05.412
Come on man, that's still my family.

1:08:05.412 --> 1:08:09.155
Besides, we don't trust no
police, white nor black.

1:08:09.155 --> 1:08:11.955
He just talking and talking
and talking and talking.

1:08:11.955 --> 1:08:14.314
I was trying to get the
fuck up out of there.

1:08:39.572 --> 1:08:40.739
- Pursue your.

1:08:59.674 --> 1:09:01.341
- Pursue your dream.

1:09:02.893 --> 1:09:06.393
Dare to be different and dare to be great.

1:09:11.413 --> 1:09:12.723
- Hi, I'm Lucy Clairmont,

1:09:12.723 --> 1:09:15.064
here live at Turnt Studios.

1:09:15.064 --> 1:09:17.225
Police have just taken into custody

1:09:17.225 --> 1:09:20.426
the once famed and loved rap star Faze.

1:09:20.426 --> 1:09:23.035
Faze, whose real name is Marcus Jackson,

1:09:23.035 --> 1:09:24.734
has been charged with the murder

1:09:24.734 --> 1:09:27.410
of up-and-coming rapper Kenny Stanford,

1:09:27.410 --> 1:09:29.055
who's known as That Deal.

1:09:29.055 --> 1:09:32.905
Kenny's death left the
community torn and angry

1:09:32.905 --> 1:09:34.581
after he received the news.
- Shit, the whole time

1:09:34.581 --> 1:09:37.868
I was thinking.
- On the hit TV show "Turnt."

1:09:37.868 --> 1:09:41.142
His life was cut short due
to senseless street violence,

1:09:41.142 --> 1:09:42.863
and remained unsolved until moments ago.

1:09:42.863 --> 1:09:44.917
- I need to go handle this.
- When Marcus Jackson

1:09:44.917 --> 1:09:46.314
was apprehended for a disturbance here.

1:09:46.314 --> 1:09:48.884
- I can't go back to jail.
- Police did find the murder

1:09:48.884 --> 1:09:50.882
weapon in his vehicle.
- Shit.

1:09:50.882 --> 1:09:53.206
- Apparently, Jackson has been on a spiral

1:09:53.206 --> 1:09:55.479
after the fast living and money blowing

1:09:55.479 --> 1:09:57.319
has caught up with him.

1:09:57.319 --> 1:09:59.632
Sources tell us that he is so unmanageable

1:09:59.632 --> 1:10:02.096
that even his family
and friends have stopped

1:10:02.096 --> 1:10:03.655
dealing with him.

1:10:03.655 --> 1:10:07.835
- The news described this
dude that killed my brother.

1:10:07.835 --> 1:10:11.002
And I realized that I'm just like him.

1:10:11.948 --> 1:10:15.240
And I realize I'm the
one who killed Kenny.

1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:17.985
I ain't no better than him.

1:10:17.985 --> 1:10:21.505
I probably did kill somebody's brother.

1:10:21.505 --> 1:10:24.922
I feel really bad with this kind of pain.

1:10:26.032 --> 1:10:27.782
Shit, all these hoes.

1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:33.214
Fuck that.

1:10:33.214 --> 1:10:35.797
Ladonna is beautiful and loyal.

1:10:36.905 --> 1:10:39.462
I'm gonna tighten up.

1:10:39.462 --> 1:10:41.462
Be with my wife forever.

1:10:46.616 --> 1:10:49.949
Always.

1:11:16.243 --> 1:11:19.147
Lord, before you call me home,

1:11:19.147 --> 1:11:21.409
let me make it right.

1:11:21.409 --> 1:11:24.713
I was supposed to keep
Kenny's dream alive.

1:11:24.713 --> 1:11:28.199
I was too busy trying to play God.

1:11:51.762 --> 1:11:56.679
- This about her, right?

1:11:57.903 --> 1:12:00.512
- You know, I feel sorry for Blu.

1:12:00.512 --> 1:12:01.845
She loves Rilla.

1:12:02.921 --> 1:12:05.011
And he loved her too.

1:12:05.011 --> 1:12:06.411
Rilla got a lot of women out there,

1:12:06.411 --> 1:12:08.945
but something about Blu.

1:12:08.945 --> 1:12:13.758
You know, but it is good to
see him get his shit together.

1:12:13.758 --> 1:12:16.341
- Why can't we just be friends?

1:12:23.067 --> 1:12:26.484
You don't love me enough to be my friend?

1:12:32.109 --> 1:12:32.942
- No.

1:12:35.310 --> 1:12:37.727
- You deserve better than me.

1:12:39.459 --> 1:12:43.047
- He was losing
friends and family.

1:12:43.047 --> 1:12:46.630
He stopped dealing with
Zina, Shooter, Unk.

1:12:47.979 --> 1:12:50.896
He was just going home to his wife.

1:12:53.493 --> 1:12:55.576
- What's better than you?

1:13:10.394 --> 1:13:12.227
What's wrong with you?

1:13:13.775 --> 1:13:16.108
'Cause I gave you all of me.

1:13:20.462 --> 1:13:21.712
Don't leave me.

1:14:33.182 --> 1:14:34.883
- I woke up the other morning,

1:14:34.883 --> 1:14:37.726
feeling like God was talking to me.

1:14:37.726 --> 1:14:39.758
When I found out my sister and Cortney

1:14:39.758 --> 1:14:41.425
was getting married,

1:14:42.606 --> 1:14:44.462
I dropped everything.

1:14:44.462 --> 1:14:47.464
- Who give this lovely
beautiful lady away?

1:14:47.464 --> 1:14:48.942
- I do.

1:14:48.942 --> 1:14:51.085
- I was so happy for them.

1:14:51.085 --> 1:14:53.281
Yeah, I'm happy too.

1:14:53.281 --> 1:14:55.821
It wouldn't have been
the same without 'em.

1:14:55.821 --> 1:14:58.242
Look at this sister.

1:14:58.242 --> 1:15:00.379
She happy as hell.

1:15:00.379 --> 1:15:04.129
It's all love.

1:15:08.219 --> 1:15:11.802
- Now you can go ahead
and kiss your bride.

1:15:13.061 --> 1:15:16.061
Ah come on, man, kiss the lady, man!

1:16:03.056 --> 1:16:03.889
- Yes?

1:16:05.397 --> 1:16:07.157
- Hello, ma'am.

1:16:07.157 --> 1:16:09.136
I'm Detective Kruthers.

1:16:09.136 --> 1:16:11.776
I'll be honest with you.

1:16:11.776 --> 1:16:13.109
I need your son.

1:16:13.978 --> 1:16:15.979
- No, Cortney know what he doing, man.

1:16:15.979 --> 1:16:18.136
Yeah I got to get a nigga his props, man.

1:16:18.136 --> 1:16:19.819
That nigga really know what he doing.

1:16:19.819 --> 1:16:22.080
He made a lot of things happen,
you know what I'm saying?

1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:24.640
Now he talking about we
supposed to head to LA.

1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:26.096
And after that, you know what I'm saying,

1:16:26.096 --> 1:16:27.397
nigga supposed to be on "Turnt."

1:16:27.397 --> 1:16:28.640
You know what I mean?
- Oh my God.

1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:30.459
- Yeah, that's hard, that's hard.

1:16:30.459 --> 1:16:33.253
That's real hard to be on "Turnt."

1:16:33.253 --> 1:16:34.893
- Excuse me?

1:16:34.893 --> 1:16:37.153
- Oh, I'm talking about the rap game.

1:16:37.153 --> 1:16:39.957
Your youngest song, he
was a rapper, right?

1:16:39.957 --> 1:16:41.971
See, back in the days, New York rappers

1:16:41.971 --> 1:16:43.856
used to say stuff like,

1:16:43.856 --> 1:16:47.136
my mind spray her, killing her verbally.

1:16:47.136 --> 1:16:49.994
You know, all metaphorically speaking.

1:16:49.994 --> 1:16:51.994
But these kids nowadays.

1:16:53.170 --> 1:16:55.087
They go and find a gun.

1:16:55.957 --> 1:16:59.595
But once one of them punk
asses get shot or killed,

1:16:59.595 --> 1:17:02.053
everybody want to cry, put
their face on T-shirts,

1:17:02.053 --> 1:17:04.053
and get revenge.

1:17:04.053 --> 1:17:05.696
- Look, sir.

1:17:05.696 --> 1:17:10.696
We share some of the same
views, but why are you here?

1:17:10.997 --> 1:17:13.435
Now the department called me,

1:17:13.435 --> 1:17:16.757
saying that my family and I
could finally get closure.

1:17:16.757 --> 1:17:19.216
Do you call this closure?

1:17:19.216 --> 1:17:21.456
'Cause if you found the
person who killed my baby,

1:17:21.456 --> 1:17:24.075
then why are you looking for Labareis?

1:17:24.075 --> 1:17:26.976
- You seem like such a nice lady.

1:17:26.976 --> 1:17:28.437
- Matter fact, in big
style, I go to the gym.

1:17:28.437 --> 1:17:29.270
- Yeah?

1:17:31.019 --> 1:17:32.917
- So you want to meet me by the studio?

1:17:32.917 --> 1:17:34.534
- Sure, babe.

1:17:34.534 --> 1:17:37.835
Let me get that address too
since your phone is dead.

1:17:37.835 --> 1:17:40.155
Put it in a GPS.
- 54,

1:17:40.155 --> 1:17:43.637
I think it's 5417 Halfway House.

1:17:43.637 --> 1:17:45.477
Halfway House Southwest.

1:17:45.477 --> 1:17:46.555
- Alright I got it.

1:17:46.555 --> 1:17:47.637
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1:17:47.637 --> 1:17:48.698
I'll see you later.
- You straight?

1:17:48.698 --> 1:17:50.974
I'm gonna see you later on.
- Alright.

1:17:50.974 --> 1:17:55.858
- See, Rilla is responsible
for 13 deaths this year alone.

1:17:55.858 --> 1:17:58.358
And all 13 has something to do

1:17:59.755 --> 1:18:03.160
with your youngest son's revenge.

1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:04.827
Even my sister.
- No.

1:18:07.157 --> 1:18:08.757
- That low life.

1:18:08.757 --> 1:18:13.007
He killed my niece and her
boyfriend in cold blood.

1:18:18.174 --> 1:18:20.514
Now you call that motherfucker

1:18:20.514 --> 1:18:22.877
and tell him his days are numbered.

1:18:22.877 --> 1:18:26.578
You fuck with my family,
I fuck with yours!

1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:33.570
You have a good day, ma'am.

1:18:56.319 --> 1:18:57.359
- How long has it been?

1:18:57.359 --> 1:19:01.635
- You have arrived
at your destination.

1:19:01.635 --> 1:19:03.518
- I had to cut the GPS off

1:19:03.518 --> 1:19:05.454
while we were driving.

1:19:05.454 --> 1:19:06.931
It's been 25 minutes, babe.

1:19:06.931 --> 1:19:09.014
- Alright cool cool cool.

1:19:10.718 --> 1:19:13.176
- I got two missed calls from your mother.

1:19:13.176 --> 1:19:14.398
Something might be wrong.

1:19:14.398 --> 1:19:15.758
I'm about to call her.

1:19:15.758 --> 1:19:16.755
- Oh alright.

1:19:16.755 --> 1:19:18.296
Yeah, my phone's dead, remember?

1:19:18.296 --> 1:19:19.694
- Oh yeah yeah yeah.

1:19:19.694 --> 1:19:21.395
- Matter fact, call to see what's up.

1:19:21.395 --> 1:19:23.290
- Alright.
- Got things to do.

1:19:23.290 --> 1:19:24.435
- Okay.

1:19:24.435 --> 1:19:26.035
This must be the spot right here?

1:19:26.035 --> 1:19:27.374
- Yeah, this is it.

1:19:27.374 --> 1:19:30.040
- Alright, find out what
they're gonna do about parking.

1:19:30.040 --> 1:19:31.779
- Don't worry, I got it.

1:19:31.779 --> 1:19:34.176
Take care of your business.
- There you go baby, alright.

1:19:34.176 --> 1:19:35.509

1:19:42.938 --> 1:19:44.105
Come on, baby.

1:19:46.960 --> 1:19:49.377
Alright, see you in a minute.

1:19:50.333 --> 1:19:52.218
- Babe.

1:19:52.218 --> 1:19:55.797
Thank you so much for the
man that you're becoming.

1:19:55.797 --> 1:19:57.477
Trying to come out the street life.

1:19:57.477 --> 1:19:59.259
That's all I wanted.

1:19:59.259 --> 1:20:00.817
I'm so glad.

1:20:00.817 --> 1:20:02.859
- Alright babe, I appreciate you.

1:20:02.859 --> 1:20:06.776
I love you too.

1:20:38.222 --> 1:20:42.862
- Oh my God.

1:21:08.518 --> 1:21:10.435
- This crooked ass cop.

1:21:11.477 --> 1:21:14.477
How the fuck he know where I was at?

1:21:17.535 --> 1:21:20.693
- I done put my wife through a lot.

1:21:20.693 --> 1:21:24.437
Now she gotta live the
rest of her life in pain.

1:21:24.437 --> 1:21:25.855
Damn.

1:21:36.853 --> 1:21:39.797
- I know the streets better than this.

1:21:48.015 --> 1:21:50.933
- Now I done really let her down.

1:21:50.933 --> 1:21:53.168
After all she done.

1:21:57.242 --> 1:22:00.741
- No, this ain't how
it's supposed to happen.

1:22:00.741 --> 1:22:03.679
Detective Kruthers got at Blu.

1:22:03.679 --> 1:22:06.534
Told her she was gonna go
to jail and lose her kids

1:22:06.534 --> 1:22:10.034
if she didn't tell him where Rilla was at.

1:22:15.119 --> 1:22:18.406
- Then his dirty ass tried
to fuck her afterwards.

1:22:21.100 --> 1:22:22.767
- And he ain't shit.

1:22:23.777 --> 1:22:26.119
Catch her when she down.

1:22:26.119 --> 1:22:27.894
They say she loved Rilla.

1:22:31.709 --> 1:22:33.768
- She loved him too much.

1:22:33.768 --> 1:22:37.851
She seen a picture of him
and his wife, his wife.

1:22:38.727 --> 1:22:41.310
Figured, if she can't have him,

1:22:42.631 --> 1:22:44.548
then neither could she.

1:22:54.210 --> 1:22:58.071
- Damn these motherfucking
streets is dirty.
