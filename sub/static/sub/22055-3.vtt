I wasn't against you.

You're mad.

02:23.902 --> 02:25.041
Do you know why
I'm getting mad?

Because I know you talkshit behind my back saying

I only had two fucking
things to cook.

Because I'm the
bounce back queen.

02:43.301 --> 02:44.923
Nothing but a team player sinceI stepped foot in these doors.

- OK.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.719
And all I do is
time wellingtons.

02:47.822 --> 02:49.652
Are you kidding me?

I did have all the
other proteins assigned

02:51.343 --> 02:52.482
to me besides wellingtons.

02:52.586 --> 02:53.828

03:02.492 --> 03:03.804
Ratchet girls.

03:03.907 --> 03:05.185
You have
wellingtons, and I had

03:05.288 --> 03:06.324
everything else assigned to me.

03:06.427 --> 03:07.221
- That's fine.
- OK.

03:07.325 --> 03:08.118
Go do you.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.361
I'm just saying.

03:09.465 --> 03:10.742
I can't.
- Go do you.

03:10.845 --> 03:12.606
Why you're so offended
about my statement?

03:12.709 --> 03:14.470
My motivation is
offensive to you.

03:14.573 --> 03:15.609
I was trying to
help you today.

03:15.712 --> 03:16.851
But you had an
attitude about it.

Where's the alcohol?

03:18.922 --> 03:20.579
DANA: They're going in
circles and circles.

03:20.683 --> 03:21.718

Like shut up.

03:23.617 --> 03:25.170
If you want to see afuckin' Brooklyn come out,

03:25.274 --> 03:26.482

that this time.

03:28.277 --> 03:29.278
Robyn.

03:29.381 --> 03:30.175
She snapped out.

03:30.279 --> 03:32.073
And said I wasn't a team player.

03:32.177 --> 03:33.489
- Because you disre-- fuck--- OK.

03:34.593 --> 03:35.387

04:45.388 --> 04:46.216
I don't know, chef.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.322
Maybe vitamins

04:48.426 --> 04:50.428
Vitamins and a chimichanga.

04:50.531 --> 04:51.325

Yes, chef.

04:57.227 --> 04:58.090
Sorry about that.

04:58.194 --> 04:59.437
Like Super Bowl

04:59.540 --> 05:01.093
throw up in the huddleright before the big game

05:01.197 --> 05:01.991

So I might have something here.

05:03.751 --> 05:05.201
[laughs]

05:05.305 --> 05:06.789
Josh, now that you've
tossed your cookies,

05:06.892 --> 05:09.550
what is the one quality
that every talented chef

05:09.654 --> 05:10.827
must possess?

05:10.931 --> 05:12.312
It's important to have agreat great palate, chef.

05:12.415 --> 05:13.243
Anybody else.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.244
Leadership.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.418
Imagination.

05:15.522 --> 05:17.075
All good answers.

05:17.178 --> 05:22.874
But at the core, a chef mustbe good with their hands.

05:22.977 --> 05:23.771
Agreed?

05:23.875 --> 05:24.945
Yes, chef.

05:25.048 --> 05:28.328
That is what today's
challenge is all about.

05:28.431 --> 05:31.296
Before we get started,
I'd like to provide

05:31.400 --> 05:32.815
a little inspiration.

05:57.978 --> 05:59.255
Trust me.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.946
I could go on about his speed,his skill, his dexterity.

06:01.050 --> 06:02.327
But Matthew why

06:14.650 --> 06:15.478
Brilliant.

06:19.102 --> 06:20.587
Were you watching closely?

06:20.690 --> 06:21.829
Not close enough.

06:21.933 --> 06:23.141
Jockey, Christina, please.

06:23.244 --> 06:24.245
Oh, god.

06:24.349 --> 06:25.868

GORDON RAMSAY: What I'd likeis one chef in the blue team,

06:27.904 --> 06:32.668
and one chef from the red teamto stack an amazing tower.

06:32.771 --> 06:35.464
The chef that
finishes first, wins

06:35.567 --> 06:39.157
a big advantage for theirteam in today's challenge.

06:39.260 --> 06:40.054

06:41.642 --> 06:42.988
Yeah, I'll do it.
I'll do it.

06:43.092 --> 06:43.920
I don't want to stack cups.

06:44.024 --> 06:45.266
And Michelle volunteers.

06:45.370 --> 06:47.890
I mean, she's the youngest,maybe she's into that.

06:47.993 --> 06:49.270

- All right.

06:49.374 --> 06:50.202
Let's do, Jared.

06:50.306 --> 06:51.514
If an 11-year-old
kid can do this,

06:51.618 --> 06:53.102
I definitely could do this.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.448
On your mark.

06:54.552 --> 06:56.001
Get set.
Go.

You better work on
your fingers, honey.

07:16.884 --> 07:18.265
JARED: I got it.

07:19.508 --> 07:20.301
Hold on.

07:23.512 --> 07:25.962

07:30.070 --> 07:31.105
Oh, fuck.

07:31.209 --> 07:32.866
Good thing that wasn't
the whole challenge.

07:32.969 --> 07:35.006
I would have been pretty upset.

07:35.109 --> 07:35.903
Fuck.

07:36.007 --> 07:36.904
That was terrible.

07:37.008 --> 07:38.630
[clapping]

07:38.734 --> 07:40.252
Oh, boy.

07:40.356 --> 07:41.978
Congratulations.

07:42.082 --> 07:45.499
Michelle, you've just won yourteam a 30 second advantage

07:45.603 --> 07:46.466
in the next challenge.

07:46.569 --> 07:47.743
Thank you.

07:47.846 --> 07:51.712
Now, you'll be building atower of a different kind.

07:51.816 --> 07:54.715
Something more up to your speed.

07:54.819 --> 08:00.031
This incredible seafood toweris made up of four tiers.

08:00.134 --> 08:03.379
In the first tier, we have six.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.829
Santa Barbara spot prawns.

08:04.932 --> 08:07.417
Then we have two
incredible lobsters.

08:07.521 --> 08:10.869
I have spent years in
kitchens doing nothing,

08:10.973 --> 08:14.045
but breaking downlobster for hours on end.

08:14.148 --> 08:15.529
I'm not worried about this.

08:15.633 --> 08:16.426
Bring it on.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.427
I got it.

08:17.531 --> 08:18.428
Tier number two.

08:18.532 --> 08:19.982
Oysters open beautifully.

08:20.085 --> 08:22.329
For the third tier, razor clam.

08:22.432 --> 08:24.780
Alongside that, the
Alaskan King crab.

08:24.883 --> 08:27.507
And then the fourth tier,Manila clams and sea

08:27.610 --> 08:29.750
urchin with caviar on top.

08:29.854 --> 08:30.820
Magic, right?
- Yes, chef.

08:30.924 --> 08:31.959
Yes, chef.

08:32.063 --> 08:34.652
GORDON RAMSAY: So the
first team to complete

08:34.755 --> 08:38.103
all four tiers of thisincredible seafood tier wins.

08:38.207 --> 08:39.588
Now, clearly an oddnumber for the blue team.

08:39.691 --> 08:42.107
That means one of you
guys will go twice.

08:42.211 --> 08:43.005
Are you ready?

08:43.108 --> 08:44.075
Yes, chef.

08:44.178 --> 08:45.179
Go.

08:45.283 --> 08:46.871
NARRATOR: In today's
seafood tower relay,

08:46.974 --> 08:50.357
the red team has a 30-secondhead start as they begin

08:50.460 --> 08:52.566
the first tier of their tower.

08:52.670 --> 08:53.947
Team one get ready.

08:54.050 --> 08:56.777
And it's up to Ashley and Mandato get out of the gate fast.

08:56.881 --> 08:57.675
Going in the water.

08:57.778 --> 08:58.883
Whoa.

08:58.986 --> 09:01.782
NARRATOR: Preparing
the prawns and lobster.

09:01.886 --> 09:03.612
This is a lot of
pressure going first.

09:03.715 --> 09:06.718
We have to maintain thatadvantage on the blue team

09:06.822 --> 09:08.409
because we have to
win this challenge.

09:08.513 --> 09:09.479
Right behind?

09:09.583 --> 09:11.240
CHEF: Let's go, ladies.

09:16.486 --> 09:19.248

Yeah, Van.
All right, Gio.

09:20.732 --> 09:21.595
Keep going.

09:21.699 --> 09:22.734
I feel pretty
good with shellfish.

09:22.838 --> 09:24.391
I work at a seafood restaurant.

09:24.494 --> 09:25.772
Maybe I could get my
team a jump start.

09:25.875 --> 09:27.428
All right.
I'm going to clean this.

09:27.532 --> 09:28.360
We're going to start plate.

09:29.430 --> 09:30.362

Two, four claws.

09:37.784 --> 09:38.854
Sauce.

09:38.957 --> 09:39.786
No seaweed.

Let's go, y'all.

09:40.787 --> 09:41.788
Take it back.

09:41.891 --> 09:42.685
[interposing voices]

09:42.789 --> 09:43.790
Take it back.

09:43.893 --> 09:45.377
This is our chance.
We need it right now.

09:47.345 --> 09:48.208
Come on.

09:48.311 --> 09:49.105
Go.

09:49.209 --> 09:50.037

NARRATOR: Van and
Giovanni have helped

10:01.877 --> 10:03.844
the men's team
claw their way back

10:03.948 --> 10:06.019
and cut the women's
lead in half.

10:06.122 --> 10:06.916
Team two's in.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.331

10:08.435 --> 10:10.610
NARRATOR: And both teams havemoved on to shucking a dozen

10:10.713 --> 10:12.301
oysters for the second tier.

10:12.404 --> 10:16.892
Pitting Michelle and Elise onthe red team against Benjamin

10:16.995 --> 10:18.065
and Jared for the blue.

10:18.169 --> 10:20.205

All right.

10:21.344 --> 10:22.587

behind this guys.

10:22.691 --> 10:24.451
Let's go.

10:24.554 --> 10:26.142
We need to get
these oysters shucked.

10:26.246 --> 10:29.249
And I look over at Elise,and she's working on ice.

10:29.352 --> 10:31.561
Why am I the only
person in our pair

10:31.665 --> 10:32.666
shucking all these oysters?

10:32.770 --> 10:33.563
No.

10:33.667 --> 10:34.772
They're not done.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.325
I need you to release themfrom the shell for me.

10:38.223 --> 10:39.535
Where did you
get that shucker?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.295
It's in the thing
right in front of you.

10:41.399 --> 10:42.365
Heard that.

10:42.469 --> 10:44.367
Benjamin and I start
shucking oysters.

10:44.471 --> 10:46.922
But with oysters,
you got to be gentle.

10:47.025 --> 10:50.442
You've got to caress themlike a beautiful woman.

10:50.546 --> 10:52.134
Oh, yeah.

10:52.237 --> 10:53.514
Just.

10:53.618 --> 10:55.033
There's no foreplay with this.

10:55.137 --> 10:57.657
You just slide it in there.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.761
Come on, baby.

10:58.865 --> 11:00.314
Flip it over.

11:00.418 --> 11:05.803
And so you get that beautifulplumpiness on the other side.

11:05.906 --> 11:07.045

11:12.568 --> 11:14.743
I swear I did enough,
but I guess not.

11:14.846 --> 11:15.985
They're arguing.

11:16.089 --> 11:16.986
Fuck, man.

11:17.090 --> 11:18.608
See if you can

11:55.024 --> 11:58.994
I happen to work at a oysterbar that has seafood towers.

11:59.097 --> 12:00.961

Thank you, Chef.

15:21.748 --> 15:23.163
Blue team two wins in a row.

15:23.267 --> 15:24.647
Two challenges in a row.

15:24.751 --> 15:25.959

15:26.063 --> 15:27.788
Mali-booyah.

15:27.892 --> 15:29.480
Oh, ladies.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.931
While the men are feastingon that incredible tower

15:32.034 --> 15:35.072

15:35.175 --> 15:38.972
There'll be a shellfishstation tableside for tonight's

15:39.076 --> 15:41.043
big service, and

15:46.186 --> 15:48.982
After you do that, you needto prep both kitchens ahead

15:49.086 --> 15:50.777

ELISE: The red team
is not cohesive

15:58.440 --> 16:00.373
as a unit at this point.

16:00.476 --> 16:01.650
We can't get on the same page.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.963
We can't get our rhythm.

16:04.066 --> 16:05.481
We need to fix that.

16:05.585 --> 16:06.758
CHEF: Oh, my god.
CHEF: Wow.

16:06.862 --> 16:08.139

16:08.243 --> 16:12.178
We're going to be
doing this for a while.

16:12.281 --> 16:13.351
I like the green.
It's very sleek.

16:13.455 --> 16:14.352
Very Malibu of you.

16:38.963 --> 16:40.896
Like who do you think you are?

16:41.000 --> 16:41.828
We don't need that.

16:41.931 --> 16:43.036
It feels very disorganized.

16:43.140 --> 16:45.694
[interposing voices] Thisis very disorganized.

16:45.797 --> 16:46.833
Just like dinner service.

Can we all get on one page?

16:48.973 --> 16:49.767
Hell yeah, baby.

We're going to go
and play some soccer.

18:11.883 --> 18:12.677
Soccer.

18:12.781 --> 18:14.162
That means all running.

18:14.265 --> 18:16.302
Nobody's looked at us right yet.

18:16.405 --> 18:19.028
But I don't think we looklike the running type.

18:20.927 --> 18:21.721
Let's go.

18:38.186 --> 18:39.670
My girls just idolize them.

18:39.773 --> 18:40.567
All right.

This thing has baby
fish and crunchy shells.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.619
And oh, no.

19:32.723 --> 19:34.173

Left over creme bruleebase with fish food in it.

19:36.796 --> 19:38.522

19:50.430 --> 19:52.087
Elise, you didn't try any.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.710

adventurous as you.

19:54.814 --> 19:56.436
Did you guys finish?

19:56.540 --> 19:57.334
Yes, chef.

20:03.685 --> 20:06.619
You took a bite.

20:06.722 --> 20:10.312
Elise, do not lie

Bullshit.

20:13.660 --> 20:14.765

20:14.868 --> 20:16.249
You guys are going
to line up and I'm

20:16.353 --> 20:18.217

20:18.320 --> 20:19.148
Are you serious?

20:19.252 --> 20:20.529
Yeah, I'm serious.

20:20.633 --> 20:22.600
Because if you're lying tome it's going to be an issue.

20:53.528 --> 20:54.218
I took a bite of the broth.

20:54.322 --> 20:56.324
I didn't chew up the fish.

20:56.427 --> 20:57.186
A bite of the broth.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.326
Yes.

20:58.429 --> 20:59.672
You need to take one
more bite while I watch?

20:59.775 --> 21:01.018
Fine.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.187
Some of these are angles,and it's going to fuck us.

22:07.291 --> 22:09.051

22:11.778 --> 22:14.954
I think everyone is reallygetting sick of Barbie's shit.

22:15.057 --> 22:16.783
She's not taking ownershipor responsibility

22:16.887 --> 22:18.267
for any of her mistakes.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.510
You older than all of us, girl.

22:19.614 --> 22:20.891
Grow up.

22:20.994 --> 22:24.343
So when it comes down to it,we throw her under the bus.

22:36.631 --> 22:39.288
After 16 seasons,
there were many choices

22:39.392 --> 22:40.807
running through my head.

22:40.911 --> 22:43.603
But there was one
quality that I had

22:43.707 --> 22:46.813
to have in every single
individual coming back.

22:46.917 --> 22:48.953
And that is passion.

Hey, who cooked the

NARRATOR: Although
they started strong,

33:25.934 --> 33:28.937
the red team has had astreak of careless mistakes.

Ice cold halibut

Again.

33:45.264 --> 33:46.438
What happened?

33:46.541 --> 33:48.681
The fact that we couldn'tfinish two dinner services

33:48.785 --> 33:50.545
in a row is just terrible.

33:50.649 --> 33:51.719
It seems like
we're almost taking

33:51.822 --> 33:53.824
a step back at this point.

33:53.928 --> 33:57.276
It is worse than last night.

33:57.380 --> 33:58.174
I ask you for passion.

I ask for dedication.

33:59.313 --> 34:00.935
I ask you to get in the game.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.317

Do me a favor, get upstairsand come back with two names.

34:08.184 --> 34:09.219

Disgusting.

34:10.979 --> 34:13.154
ROBYN: You and me, we're done.

34:13.258 --> 34:14.466
You don't knock down
your team members.

34:14.569 --> 34:15.398
You don't say--BARBIE: I didn't knock you down.

34:15.501 --> 34:16.640
ROBYN: Yes.

34:16.744 --> 34:17.262
You said, oh, maybe ifyou know how to cook fish.

34:17.365 --> 34:18.332
You don't do that.

34:18.435 --> 34:21.231
Barbie sandbagged
the whole team today,

34:21.335 --> 34:23.923
and that makes you a
pathetic individual.

34:24.027 --> 34:24.959
Barbie, this time I'm serious.

34:25.063 --> 34:25.925
We're done.

34:26.029 --> 34:27.479
I don't understand
what that means.

NARRATOR: While the women tryto understand each other--

34:30.654 --> 34:31.448
How long, Milly?

- Garnish walking.

On your right, chef.

34:39.007 --> 34:39.801
Garnish, duck.

Beautifully cook, Milly.

NARRATOR: And with the finalplates landing at the tables--

34:43.598 --> 34:44.565
I think you had the duck.

Did you have the duck?

34:45.773 --> 34:47.188
NARRATOR: --the men
have given Chef Ramsay

34:47.292 --> 34:49.639
their second all-star
dinner service in a row.

It's amazing.
It's like butter.

34:51.399 --> 34:52.193
So good.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.160
Thank you, gents.

34:54.161 --> 34:56.059
Thank you, chef.

34:56.163 --> 34:57.336
We're literally
giving it to them.

34:57.440 --> 34:58.613
Like giving it to them.

34:58.717 --> 35:03.066
We got out of the gates
so strong, and then bam.

35:03.170 --> 35:05.137
The bottom line iscommunication has to get better

35:05.241 --> 35:06.932
or we're going to go
home one by fucking one.

35:07.035 --> 35:08.140
Absolutely.

35:08.244 --> 35:09.969
Let's talk about serviceand let's start voting.

35:10.073 --> 35:14.871
I'm going to go
with Robyn and Amanda.

35:14.974 --> 35:16.183
Robyn, Amanda.

35:16.286 --> 35:17.632
OK, so garnish.

35:17.736 --> 35:20.048
I went over and
garnish was flustered.

35:20.152 --> 35:21.326
She don't know what to ask for.

35:21.429 --> 35:22.223
Garnish was dragging.

35:22.327 --> 35:23.638
[interposing voices]

35:23.742 --> 35:26.572
Garnish was not dragging untilall of those tickets came back.

35:26.676 --> 35:28.505
Not one of my things came back.

35:28.609 --> 35:30.473
MANDA: I think Barbie is toblame for dinner service.

35:30.576 --> 35:32.578
Every single protein
came back tonight.

35:32.682 --> 35:34.304
My vote is actually from meat.

35:34.408 --> 35:35.271
Ashley and Barbie?

35:35.374 --> 35:36.168
Yes.

35:36.272 --> 35:37.687
That set us off.

35:37.790 --> 35:38.688
I'm going with meat.

35:38.791 --> 35:39.827
I did look over.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.450
Barbie looked like she
was really, really busy.

35:42.554 --> 35:44.763
And no offense to
you Ashley, but you

35:44.866 --> 35:46.730
seem like you had idle time.

35:46.834 --> 35:48.525
No, I was running the
meats back and forth.

35:48.629 --> 35:49.595
We did everything together.

35:49.699 --> 35:51.563
If these bitches try
to put me up there,

35:51.666 --> 35:52.460
I'm going to be pissed.

35:52.564 --> 35:53.703
I did nothing wrong, man.

35:53.806 --> 35:55.532
What was the point
of no return, though?

35:55.636 --> 35:56.568
[interposing voices]

35:56.671 --> 35:58.328
The halibut was
not being sold.

35:58.432 --> 36:00.158
When was it like, we're
not recovering at all.

36:00.261 --> 36:01.780
That was meat and fish.

36:01.883 --> 36:03.471
Every protein came back.

36:03.575 --> 36:06.025
The problem was this, likethe arguing on the line--

36:06.129 --> 36:07.441
- Has to stop.
- It is disgusting.

36:07.544 --> 36:08.338
That is not the answer.

36:08.442 --> 36:09.546
What was the argument over?

36:09.650 --> 36:11.169
Because of the
salmon, she said,

36:11.272 --> 36:12.584
maybe you should learn
how to cook fish.

36:12.687 --> 36:13.792
Barbie?
BARBIE: Yes.

36:13.895 --> 36:15.000
Please try to be accuratewith your times, please.

36:15.103 --> 36:17.071
Please try to learn
how to cook fish.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.315
It was uncalled for for
you to have said that.

36:19.418 --> 36:22.663
There's no reason for me tobe going up for elimination.

36:22.766 --> 36:24.596
Robyn could not
handle her station.

36:24.699 --> 36:26.011
Learn to cook fish.

36:26.114 --> 36:27.530
I can't do it for you.

36:27.633 --> 36:29.670
Like why are you puttingdown your team like that?

36:29.773 --> 36:31.465
Barbie, can you agree
to stop taking jabs,

36:31.568 --> 36:32.673
and can you agree
to brush it off?

36:32.776 --> 36:33.881
I deserve an apology.

36:33.984 --> 36:38.851
I apologize that
you can't cook fish.

36:38.955 --> 36:40.715
Robyn, sit down.

36:40.819 --> 36:43.270
I'm going over here becauseyou're crazy with those eyes

36:43.373 --> 36:44.754

The red team's
first nominee tonight

37:33.630 --> 37:36.530
was Robyn because she
could not handle fish.

37:36.633 --> 37:37.945
Red team's second nominee?

37:38.048 --> 37:43.778
Red team's second
nominee is me, chef.

37:43.882 --> 37:44.883
Why?

37:44.986 --> 37:46.056
Dana?

37:46.160 --> 37:47.989
It's her and herfighting with other people

37:48.093 --> 37:50.406
in the kitchen, whichisn't helpful communication

37:50.509 --> 37:52.235
during dinner service.

37:52.339 --> 37:54.133
What's missing, ladies?

37:54.237 --> 37:55.963
There's no team effort, chef.

37:56.066 --> 37:57.930
Everybody's acting
as individuals.

37:58.034 --> 38:00.830
The home around the kitchenchef, if we're a team,

38:00.933 --> 38:02.590
we should, instead of
beating each other down,

38:02.694 --> 38:05.179
we should pick each otherup, and that wasn't the case.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.906
Anybody else receive votes?

38:08.009 --> 38:09.666
Ashley, chef.

38:09.770 --> 38:11.081
And why Ashley?

38:11.185 --> 38:14.878
The team felt Ashley
didn't do enough.

38:14.982 --> 38:16.708
Anybody else receive votes?

38:16.811 --> 38:18.261
I got one or two.

38:18.365 --> 38:19.400
Wow.

38:19.504 --> 38:25.026
Robyn, Barbie, Ashley,
Amanda, step forward.

38:25.130 --> 38:28.340
We are spoilt for choice.

38:28.444 --> 38:31.067
Barbie, why should you
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

38:31.170 --> 38:33.621
I should stay in Hell'sKitchen because I'm focused,

38:33.725 --> 38:35.485
I'm driven, and
I'm communicating.

38:35.589 --> 38:36.693
I want this.

38:36.797 --> 38:39.247
What is it that
they've got against you?

38:39.351 --> 38:40.490
What's happening?

38:40.594 --> 38:41.905
I think that there's awhole lot of mouths running

38:42.009 --> 38:44.252
and not enough ears listening.

38:44.356 --> 38:47.670
Robyn, you were responsible
for 90% of the problems

38:47.773 --> 38:48.705
on the fish station.

38:48.809 --> 38:50.431
Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

38:50.535 --> 38:52.157
Even though I was
messing up, I was still

38:52.260 --> 38:53.676
communicating with garnish.

38:53.779 --> 38:55.229
I was trying to
communicate with Barbie.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.335
But one team member who
knocks down the morale,

38:57.438 --> 38:58.405
it's kind of hard.

38:58.508 --> 39:00.165
I was trying tocommunicate about the food

39:00.268 --> 39:02.650
and about getting the foodout and serving the guests.

39:02.754 --> 39:05.377
This is your kitchen and Idon't want to disrespect you.

39:05.481 --> 39:08.242
Manda, why do you think youshould stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:08.346 --> 39:10.348
I started off the
night so organized

39:10.451 --> 39:13.765
and I had to refire
things six times.

39:13.868 --> 39:19.218
Everything that I sent
up was good, but died.

39:19.322 --> 39:23.568
Ashley, you left the servicethis evening to sit at the bar.

39:23.671 --> 39:24.500
How was it, by the way?

39:24.603 --> 39:26.191
It was horrible, chef.

39:26.294 --> 39:28.366
I've never seen anyone stareat their watch for as long

39:28.469 --> 39:29.712
as you did.

39:29.815 --> 39:31.783
I was just trying to makesure that everything was timed

39:31.886 --> 39:33.543
properly in my
head, and I was just

39:33.647 --> 39:35.752
trying to make sure that
the duck and the lamb

39:35.856 --> 39:37.098
was not going to overcook.

39:37.202 --> 39:40.067
You haven't even
broken a sweat.

39:40.170 --> 39:43.346
You seemed to finish servicebetter looking than you

39:43.450 --> 39:46.142
were before we started.

39:46.245 --> 39:47.799
It will never happen again.

39:47.902 --> 39:49.835
I am better than this andI'm stronger than this.

39:49.939 --> 39:51.250
This is not who I am.

39:51.354 --> 39:54.288
So why so many failures
in the red team tonight?

39:54.392 --> 39:55.772
It's communication.

39:55.876 --> 39:58.050
I feel like it was
just miscommunication

39:58.154 --> 39:58.948
all across the board.

40:03.159 --> 40:03.953
My decision is--

40:08.440 --> 40:09.199
Barbie.

40:13.169 --> 40:13.997
Get back in line.

40:14.101 --> 40:14.895
Yes, chef.

40:18.933 --> 40:19.727
Ashley.

40:24.732 --> 40:26.734
Take off your
jacket, young lady.

40:26.838 --> 40:29.047
Leave Hell's Kitchen,
and here's why.

40:29.150 --> 40:30.980
This evening, I saw no fight.

40:31.083 --> 40:33.016
You were disconnected.

40:33.120 --> 40:35.605
You look lost from the
beginning of the service

40:35.709 --> 40:37.780
to the end of the service.

40:37.883 --> 40:39.057
OK.

40:39.160 --> 40:39.989
Good night.

40:40.990 --> 40:41.784
Bye, Ashley.

40:41.887 --> 40:42.681
Bye, Ash.

40:45.373 --> 40:46.685
ASHLEY: I am not
happy with the fact

40:46.789 --> 40:48.169
that I'm leaving this early.

40:48.273 --> 40:49.792
Barbie's running on a thin line.

40:49.895 --> 40:52.484
Her and Robyn both, they needto check their egos at the door.

40:52.588 --> 40:55.073
But I can't help it that
they're shady bitches.

40:55.176 --> 40:56.108
This is Hell's Kitchen.

40:56.212 --> 40:59.146
It is literally
hell, hell on earth.

40:59.249 --> 41:02.045
Robyn, Manda, back in line.

41:02.149 --> 41:04.462
Thank you, chef.

41:04.565 --> 41:07.568
Ladies, when are you
going to win something?

41:07.672 --> 41:08.466
Tomorrow, chef.

41:08.569 --> 41:10.709
Sort it out.

41:10.813 --> 41:13.609
Now get out of there.

41:13.712 --> 41:16.543
I feel like it's fuckingdeja vu all over again.

41:16.646 --> 41:17.854
Squawk, squawk, squawk, Barbie.

41:17.958 --> 41:20.201
All you do is squawk
like a fucking hen.

41:20.305 --> 41:21.099
Squawk.

41:22.928 --> 41:25.586
What are you waiting for,a fucking hot chocolate?

41:25.690 --> 41:27.657
Fuck off.

41:27.761 --> 41:30.177
Ashley's a strong
fucking cook who's

41:30.280 --> 41:32.386
supposed to be like
season 15, me and Ash

41:32.490 --> 41:33.421
in the black jackets.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.665
If the red team
were better cooks,

41:35.769 --> 41:37.287
they would just
support each other

41:37.391 --> 41:38.875
and not throw each
other under the bus.

41:41.602 --> 41:42.707
It was inevitable.

41:42.810 --> 41:44.605
There is a target on my back.

41:44.709 --> 41:46.158
I've been here before.

41:46.262 --> 41:48.160
They've done this before.

41:48.264 --> 41:52.820
I've survived it before,and I'll survive it again.

41:52.924 --> 41:55.651
Ashley spent more timestaring at her watch than paying

41:55.754 --> 41:59.137
attention to a station, and soher time here in Hell's Kitchen

41:59.240 --> 42:00.034
is done.

42:06.247 --> 42:07.594
NARRATOR: Next time
on "Hell's Kitchen."

42:07.697 --> 42:10.700
How are my Nubian princessesdoing out here tonight?

42:10.804 --> 42:12.840
Barbie is sexy.

42:12.944 --> 42:14.186
NARRATOR: Will
innocent flirting--

42:14.290 --> 42:16.223
Don't make me go put
on my swimsuit, Van.

42:16.326 --> 42:18.950
You know you ain't going
to be able to handle it.

42:19.053 --> 42:21.228
NARRATOR: --cross theline into something more?

42:21.331 --> 42:22.125
He's always hot.

42:22.229 --> 42:23.955
Like he's hot-blooded.

42:24.058 --> 42:25.404
Chicks love cuddling with me.

42:25.508 --> 42:27.061
You know what's
going on in my head?

42:27.165 --> 42:28.476
Van.

42:28.580 --> 42:29.857
NARRATOR: And could
his southern charm--

42:29.961 --> 42:31.031
Whoo-wee.

42:31.134 --> 42:32.895
You know you like some
white chocolate, Barbie.

42:32.998 --> 42:35.035
NARRATOR: --be just
a ploy to get ahead?

42:35.138 --> 42:36.208
I got this in the bag.

42:36.312 --> 42:37.796
I could charm the fangs
off a rattle snake.

42:37.900 --> 42:39.177
[rattling]

42:39.280 --> 42:41.110
NARRATOR: --And maybe throwBarbie completely off her game?

42:41.213 --> 42:42.421
I asked you five
times, Barbie.

42:42.525 --> 42:43.319
Barbie.

42:43.422 --> 42:44.700
Uh--

42:44.803 --> 42:45.701
Walking two ducks.

42:45.804 --> 42:46.598
No, wait a minute.

42:46.702 --> 42:47.841
What do you mean wait?

42:47.944 --> 42:49.705
NARRATOR: And end up sinkingthe entire red kitchen?

42:49.808 --> 42:51.016
Are you slowed down
because of Barbie?

42:51.120 --> 42:52.431
Yes, chef.

42:52.535 --> 42:55.642
NARRATOR: Find out next timeon a scorchingly hot episode--

42:55.745 --> 42:56.815
Oh, shit.

42:56.919 --> 42:57.851
NARRATOR: --of "Hell's Kitchen."

43:00.992 --> 43:03.581
[music playing]
