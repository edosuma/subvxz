<i>They say it's a personality thing,</i>

00:02.977 --> 00:06.247

00:06.315 --> 00:08.350
<i>Some folks like chocolate.</i>

00:08.417 --> 00:10.452
<i>I'll take vanilla.</i>

00:10.519 --> 00:13.855

<i>Go get 'em, Cats!</i>

01:26.962 --> 01:28.396
Hmm.

01:28.397 --> 01:30.231
Buddy, hey?

01:30.282 --> 01:32.233
You still with me? Yeah. Yeah. No. I just...

01:32.284 --> 01:33.734
Your description of the CAT Squad

01:33.786 --> 01:35.286
has sent me into fantasy land.

01:35.371 --> 01:37.905
I don't even want to think
about what goes on there,

01:37.957 --> 01:39.441
but according to the CIA database,

01:39.508 --> 01:40.942
the CAT Squad was bad ass.

01:41.010 --> 01:43.344
I just still hope they're tight,
because I'm running dry

01:43.412 --> 01:44.879
trying to find Sarah's old friends

01:44.930 --> 01:46.381
for our engagement party.

01:46.449 --> 01:49.801
Really? Um... here's a crazy notion.

01:49.885 --> 01:51.486
Ask Sarah.

01:51.554 --> 01:54.522
Well, yeah, uh, not-not such a wild notion.

01:54.590 --> 01:56.424
It's just, she's being
very reluctant to help.

01:56.492 --> 01:58.092
You know, she-she's got a very complicated

01:58.160 --> 01:59.727
relationship with her family,
she's lost touch

01:59.795 --> 02:01.629
with her friends, but I know she'd want

02:01.697 --> 02:04.399
someone there, you know,
so I'm nudging, being a good fiancé.

02:04.467 --> 02:05.900
I'm trying to help fix things.

02:05.968 --> 02:07.402
Got it. Good.

02:07.403 --> 02:09.838
Good for you. Where do I come in?

02:09.905 --> 02:12.907
Well, uh, Carina was one of the Cats.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.477
Carina, Carina?

02:15.544 --> 02:16.578
So I need her info.

02:16.579 --> 02:18.797
Chuck. Carina? Really?

02:18.881 --> 02:20.648
I mean, Alex is gonna be there.

02:20.716 --> 02:22.951
Alex, Carina. Carina, Alex.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.886
Two of my lovers in the same place?

02:24.954 --> 02:27.639
The universe may just collapse on itself.

02:27.723 --> 02:29.007
Dude, give me the info.

02:29.008 --> 02:30.525
Oh, fine. I don't even know

02:30.593 --> 02:33.294
if I have it anymore. I mean...

02:33.362 --> 02:35.847
Here's her phone and
e-mail and Facebook alias.

02:35.931 --> 02:37.098
We're friends. Restricted.

02:37.099 --> 02:39.133
I can't post on her wall or view pictures.

02:39.185 --> 02:41.002
Go-Go easy on her. Break this whole

02:41.070 --> 02:43.505
Alex thing to her gently.

02:43.572 --> 02:45.607
Carina's a-a delicate girl.

03:00.506 --> 03:02.373
Walker in a white dress?

03:02.458 --> 03:04.726
Please. But the Cats...

03:04.793 --> 03:06.294
Interesting.

03:06.345 --> 03:07.679
What?

03:07.680 --> 03:09.163
My old spy partner's getting hitched.

03:09.215 --> 03:11.466
Her fiancé wants to get
the old team back together.

03:11.517 --> 03:12.884
Nice.

03:16.105 --> 03:17.305
Hello?

03:17.306 --> 03:19.006
Amy, Walker's getting married.

03:19.058 --> 03:21.008
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh,
my God! Oh, my God!

03:21.060 --> 03:23.394
Stop screaming. How do we find Zondra?

03:25.231 --> 03:26.514
Hi, Sarah.

03:26.515 --> 03:28.182
Hey. Heading out?

03:28.234 --> 03:29.868
Yes, to the in-laws.

03:29.952 --> 03:31.853
Devon's packing up the car.

03:31.921 --> 03:34.155
We're doing a little overnight
for the grandparents.

03:34.206 --> 03:37.025
But we'll be back with plenty
of time for your party.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.526
How's the invite list coming?

03:38.594 --> 03:41.579
Done... I thought.

03:41.664 --> 03:44.865
I told Chuck that I didn't
really have anyone to invite,

03:44.917 --> 03:47.034
but he has this big idea now that

03:47.086 --> 03:48.903
he wants to discuss with me. Oh, boy.

03:48.971 --> 03:51.205
Yeah. I'm really excited for the party,

03:51.257 --> 03:52.941
but digging into the past--

03:53.008 --> 03:55.176
old friends and family-- it's, um...

03:55.244 --> 03:57.345
It's a bit complicated for me.

03:57.413 --> 03:59.180
And Chuck just dives right in.

03:59.248 --> 04:00.348
Head first.

04:00.349 --> 04:01.616
Well, I could talk to him.

04:01.617 --> 04:05.019
No, I should probably try
and get over the terror

04:05.070 --> 04:06.854
that I'm feeling right now.

04:06.922 --> 04:08.356
Sarah, if you ever need

04:08.357 --> 04:10.358
to talk about complicated family situations,

04:10.426 --> 04:13.795
wedding stuff, anything, you can come to me.

04:13.862 --> 04:16.130
Thank you. I appreciate that.

04:16.197 --> 04:18.249
It does feel good to talk about it.

04:18.334 --> 04:19.901
Anyway, have fun.

04:19.969 --> 04:22.537
Well, not likely, but thank you.

04:30.045 --> 04:31.763
We having company?

04:31.847 --> 04:34.949
Oh, no, not we. You.

04:35.017 --> 04:37.969
Two words: CAT Squad.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.189
The CAT Squad.

04:41.256 --> 04:44.626
Wow. I, um... I didn't see that one coming.

04:44.693 --> 04:46.961
Well, you know, I thought it'd be fun.

04:47.029 --> 04:48.763
I mean, your old team.

04:48.831 --> 04:51.065
One could be a bridesmaid,
or-or even the maid of honor.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.333
I haven't seen them

04:52.334 --> 04:54.302
in a very long time, and I've changed a lot.

04:54.370 --> 04:55.637
Look, I-I just think

04:55.638 --> 04:56.838
that we should have talked
about this beforehand.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.740
This could open a Pandora's box.

04:58.807 --> 05:00.408
Really? How?

05:00.476 --> 05:02.543
Well, first of all-- Carina?

05:02.611 --> 05:04.112
She was the mellow one.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.048
Oh. So, you were a little
wild back in the day.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.301
Hey, hey, hey, Sarah.

05:10.386 --> 05:13.755
I get it. I do. I get it. You're nervous.

05:13.822 --> 05:15.757
I- I understand. I was
terrified when I went searching

05:15.808 --> 05:17.759
for my mom, but look how that paid off.

05:17.826 --> 05:22.647
It's just, you don't really know
what to expect with this team.

05:22.731 --> 05:24.849
WOMAN Sarah Walker!

05:24.933 --> 05:27.802
Oh, no. Oh, no, what?

05:35.327 --> 05:36.544
What's going on?

05:36.545 --> 05:38.646
Is it Close Encounters?

05:38.697 --> 05:40.682
Is this really happening?

05:40.749 --> 05:42.350
There's our girl!

06:02.438 --> 06:03.904
It's my ex!

06:04.807 --> 06:06.140
Heard you were getting married.

06:06.141 --> 06:07.558
You know what that means.

06:07.643 --> 06:09.410
Girls' night out.

06:11.847 --> 06:14.315
I'm Chuck, by the way. Buckle up, girl.
We're going for a ride.

06:14.366 --> 06:17.017
We'll have her back by 12:00.

06:17.069 --> 06:18.519
Midnight is very sensible!

06:18.587 --> 06:21.372
Try noon tomorrow, lover boy.

06:21.457 --> 06:22.923
Maybe.

06:24.760 --> 06:25.960
Hello, Carina.

06:25.961 --> 06:28.296
You look well.

06:29.748 --> 06:32.433
Morgan. Remember? Morgan?

06:34.386 --> 06:36.587
Something's different about you.

06:36.672 --> 06:38.539
I am trying a new cologne.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.808
That might be...

06:47.082 --> 06:48.549
Let's go.

06:50.586 --> 06:52.019
I think she remembered me.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.554
Sarah was right.

06:53.605 --> 06:55.573
I honestly wasn't expecting that.

07:45.310 --> 07:46.744
Sarah?

07:48.513 --> 07:51.081
Head... hurts.

07:51.149 --> 07:54.585
You're very dressed up... for bed.

07:54.652 --> 07:56.720
Oh, we went to a club in Hollywood,

07:56.788 --> 07:58.555
and then another one in Vegas,

07:58.623 --> 08:01.392
and then an after-hours spot in Miami.

08:01.459 --> 08:05.763
Who knew that Mikhail
Gorbachev could dance so well?

08:05.830 --> 08:07.865
I guess reconnecting wasn't such a bad idea

08:07.932 --> 08:09.633
after all, now, was it?

08:09.701 --> 08:11.201
It was okay. Okay?

08:11.269 --> 08:12.920
Well, okay is good. Okay is a start.

08:13.004 --> 08:14.421
Springboard. Oh, Chuck.

08:14.506 --> 08:16.874
Come on, you saw your friends,
and you had fun.

08:16.941 --> 08:18.375
The band's back together again!

08:18.426 --> 08:21.145
<i>No, the band is not back together again.</i>

08:21.212 --> 08:22.446
Why?

08:22.447 --> 08:24.465
Look, some of us don't trust each other.

08:24.549 --> 08:27.184
Well, maybe you should
just have a quiet coffee,

08:27.251 --> 08:28.919
you know, and some conversation.

08:28.987 --> 08:30.387
No, look.

08:30.388 --> 08:32.556
A while ago, we were on a long-term mission,

08:32.607 --> 08:34.775
and the target kept
anticipating our next move.

08:34.859 --> 08:36.610
Something wasn't right in the team,

08:36.693 --> 08:38.962
so I swept our equipment for bugs,

08:39.030 --> 08:42.466
and I found a hidden transmitter
in the heel of Zondra's boot.

08:42.534 --> 08:46.203
She denied it was hers,
and she passed a lie detector test.

08:46.270 --> 08:49.773
And we shook on it and, uh,
we decided to let it go,

08:49.841 --> 08:51.775
but it stirred some bad feelings.

08:51.826 --> 08:54.378
Well, honey, if the CIA cleared Zondra,

08:54.445 --> 08:56.747
then it's got to be some
kind of misunderstanding.

08:56.798 --> 08:58.015
Right?

08:58.016 --> 08:59.299
Time can heal those.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.884
Margaritas don't hurt, either.

09:00.952 --> 09:03.787
Speaking of which, I'm working
on a new recipe for the party.

09:03.855 --> 09:06.223
Engagement parties are not
this squad's cup of tea.

09:06.290 --> 09:08.308
They're leaving when
they wake up, by the way.

09:08.393 --> 09:10.994
The CAT Squad? They're here? Mm.

09:11.062 --> 09:13.764
Yeah.

09:13.815 --> 09:16.984
They were too tired to find a hotel room.

09:17.068 --> 09:19.336
Sarah, where is Carina?

09:24.192 --> 09:26.142
Hi.

09:26.194 --> 09:27.411
Good morning.

09:28.746 --> 09:30.380
What are you doing here?!

09:30.448 --> 09:33.283
Mm. There was nowhere else
to go except the floor.

09:33.351 --> 09:36.220
But the floor can be fun, too.

09:36.287 --> 09:38.288
Hmm? What? No! Get... Stop!

09:40.041 --> 09:41.258
That was sultry.

09:41.259 --> 09:42.376
You were just sultry right there.

09:42.377 --> 09:44.211
And are you na...?

09:44.295 --> 09:45.546
Are you na...?

09:45.547 --> 09:47.731
Are you hitting on me?

09:47.799 --> 09:49.716
Something is different about you.

09:49.801 --> 09:51.468
The confidence,

09:51.536 --> 09:53.169
straight spine.

09:53.221 --> 09:55.606
It can't be true, but you're behaving

09:55.673 --> 09:56.940
like you're having regular

09:56.941 --> 09:58.675
sexual intercourse.

09:58.743 --> 09:59.943
Huh.

09:59.944 --> 10:02.479
Martin, get back in this bed.

10:02.547 --> 10:04.347
No. No!

10:04.399 --> 10:06.183
All the times that I-I e-mailed you,

10:06.251 --> 10:07.551
snail mailed, texted,

10:07.552 --> 10:09.069
called out into the night-- nothing.

10:09.153 --> 10:10.454
You completely ignored me.

10:10.455 --> 10:13.540
And now, I'm off the market, okay?

10:13.625 --> 10:16.076
So I would like you to leave.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.995
I have a lot of work to-to...

10:24.335 --> 10:25.752
Chuck?! Chuck!

10:25.753 --> 10:27.387
That woman is an animal, okay?

10:27.472 --> 10:29.590
And I will be back when she's gone!

10:29.674 --> 10:31.425
This is ridiculous.

10:34.612 --> 10:38.181
Well, that is a snazzy outfit.

10:40.268 --> 10:42.853
Hey. Hi.

10:42.921 --> 10:44.354
What brings you by here?

10:44.355 --> 10:46.290
Breakfast.

10:48.076 --> 10:50.027
You forgot. Here's the thing.

10:50.094 --> 10:52.429
I was helping Chuck surprise Sarah.

10:52.497 --> 10:53.964
Okay? She has some old work friends

10:54.032 --> 10:55.465
in town for this engagement party--

10:55.533 --> 10:57.584
just old hens-- you know,
and I just got caught up

10:57.669 --> 10:59.970
trying to help and be the
good friend, and I'm sorry.

11:00.038 --> 11:02.639
Let's just reschedule. No. Two seconds,

11:02.707 --> 11:04.441
bam, I'm out of this whole fashion statement

11:04.509 --> 11:06.176
and I'm... and I'm gonna
be ready to go, okay?

11:06.243 --> 11:08.679
I'll meet you back here...
When are you starting the French toast?

11:08.746 --> 11:12.082
Chuck said you would-- you know,
none of us can cook.

11:12.150 --> 11:13.350
Oh. Hi.

11:13.351 --> 11:15.452
Um, I'm Carina. Okay.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.987
Carina, this is... this is Alex.

11:17.055 --> 11:18.488
This is my girlfriend.

11:18.556 --> 11:19.690
Beautiful girlfriend.

11:19.691 --> 11:20.791
And this is, um...

11:20.792 --> 11:22.225
one of Sarah's...

11:22.277 --> 11:23.810
Old hens.

11:23.895 --> 11:25.929
Right. Well...

11:25.997 --> 11:28.782
It looks like you have
been enlisted to cook.

11:28.866 --> 11:30.617
Yeah, as in now. We are starving.

11:30.702 --> 11:32.569
Oh, okay. Just...

11:32.620 --> 11:34.004
Easy, easy, back inside...

11:34.005 --> 11:35.305
you; off you go.

11:36.324 --> 11:37.824
Draft'll be the... the death of you.

11:37.909 --> 11:38.909
She's just...

11:38.910 --> 11:41.011
whoa.

11:41.079 --> 11:42.312
I'm sorry, okay?

11:42.313 --> 11:44.748
You look beautiful, and I feel like a jerk.

11:44.799 --> 11:46.166
Lunch tomorrow,

11:46.167 --> 11:47.684
okay?

11:49.387 --> 11:50.587
Sure.

11:51.889 --> 11:53.456
And don't worry...

11:53.508 --> 11:55.809
Morgan, I trust you.

11:55.893 --> 11:56.994
Thank you.

11:56.995 --> 11:58.762
Well, and... I know your dad.

11:58.813 --> 12:00.897
And I trust you.

12:00.965 --> 12:02.632
Right.

12:04.352 --> 12:06.737
Now, that seemed like a threat.

12:13.211 --> 12:17.481
So... I bet you Cats have some wild stories

12:17.548 --> 12:19.482
from your CAT Squad-ing days, huh?

12:19.534 --> 12:20.917
They're top secret.

12:20.918 --> 12:22.452
Are they? AMY: We could talk

12:22.520 --> 12:23.720
about our mission to Reykjavik.

12:23.721 --> 12:24.788
The sulfur baths?

12:24.789 --> 12:25.789
The floating massages.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.224
Don't you guys ever miss it?

12:27.291 --> 12:28.625
Running around together?

12:28.626 --> 12:29.960
I guess.

12:29.961 --> 12:31.044
Sometimes.

12:31.045 --> 12:34.364
But I also like working one on one.

12:34.432 --> 12:35.899
Hey, what's up?

12:35.967 --> 12:37.517
How are you? Anybody want some more bacon?

12:37.602 --> 12:38.935
Anything? Nothing?

12:38.936 --> 12:41.021
Hey, remember Pyongyang? That dissident

12:41.105 --> 12:42.505
we broke out of jail?

12:42.506 --> 12:44.574
We did all those shots of
snake's blood afterwards.

12:44.642 --> 12:45.809
That was you and Sarah.

12:45.810 --> 12:46.910
You guys made

12:46.911 --> 12:48.278
<i>an amazing team.</i>

12:48.279 --> 12:49.413
I learned so much

12:49.414 --> 12:51.732
from you, had fun.

12:51.816 --> 12:54.084
I think about it a lot.

12:56.754 --> 12:59.389
I've b... I've been on a
number of missions myself,

12:59.457 --> 13:00.957
actually, yeah.

13:01.025 --> 13:03.710
My first one, I had to
disarm this explosive device

13:03.795 --> 13:05.045
using Internet pornography.

13:05.046 --> 13:06.129
So...

13:06.130 --> 13:07.597
Wow.

13:07.665 --> 13:09.332
This Chuck,

13:09.400 --> 13:10.567
quite a catch.

13:10.568 --> 13:12.219
He's all right.

13:12.303 --> 13:14.104
He certainly is.

13:14.172 --> 13:15.422
Okay, well, girls,

13:15.423 --> 13:16.873
it was good to see you.

13:16.941 --> 13:18.075
Sarah. Got to catch a flight.

13:18.076 --> 13:19.876
Me, too. You got room on your bike?

13:19.944 --> 13:21.261
Yeah. Guess I'd better go, too.

13:21.262 --> 13:22.396
Take me?

13:22.397 --> 13:23.847
Sure. Good.

13:23.848 --> 13:26.516
<i>The Cats certainly pack an attitude</i>

13:26.567 --> 13:28.318
and Zondra is an acquired taste,

13:28.385 --> 13:30.654
but I do think it's good you reconnected.

13:31.722 --> 13:32.989
I'll miss you.

13:32.990 --> 13:34.274
Congratulations.

13:34.275 --> 13:36.193
I'm gonna miss all you guys. Text me.

13:36.244 --> 13:37.244
Yeah. Okay.

13:37.245 --> 13:38.945
Come on, girl, let's ride.

13:41.616 --> 13:43.950
It wasn't all bad, but I'm glad it's over.

13:44.035 --> 13:45.102
Walker.

13:45.103 --> 13:46.787
Good luck with, uh... that.

13:48.072 --> 13:49.089
Keys.

13:49.090 --> 13:50.457
Baby steps,

13:50.458 --> 13:51.742
right?

13:51.743 --> 13:53.460
And no more surprises.

13:58.716 --> 14:00.049
Carina!

14:04.639 --> 14:05.789
Carina?

14:05.790 --> 14:06.890
Carina!

14:06.891 --> 14:08.108
I'll call an ambulance.

14:08.109 --> 14:10.360
Please.

14:11.646 --> 14:14.030
Carina, your leg!

14:20.171 --> 14:22.272
It's part of the bomb.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.982
Ladies, who's Augusto Gaez?

14:35.837 --> 14:37.003
<i> Augusto Gaez</i>

14:37.004 --> 14:39.122
is the arch nemesis of the CAT Squad

14:39.190 --> 14:40.757
and leader of the Gentle Hand.

14:40.825 --> 14:43.627
The bomb fragments trace
to his factory in Rio.

14:43.694 --> 14:45.195
He tracked you down, Cats.

14:45.263 --> 14:46.963
Excuse me, General-- the Gentle Hand?

14:47.031 --> 14:49.266
Are these bad guys, or a massage parlor?

14:49.333 --> 14:50.567
They're brutal killers.

14:50.568 --> 14:51.768
Terrorists for hire.

14:51.769 --> 14:53.603
If you want your competition blown away,

14:53.671 --> 14:55.638
We hunted the Gentle Hand

14:55.690 --> 14:58.074
for years, but we could never pin down Gaez.

14:58.142 --> 15:00.193
Every time we got close, he slipped away.

15:00.278 --> 15:02.028
He must have thought we reunited

15:02.113 --> 15:03.580
to come after him again.

15:03.581 --> 15:06.149
And tried to kill you on American soil.

15:06.217 --> 15:08.485
Cats, the mission is in from Langley.

15:08.553 --> 15:12.222
Capture Gaez and extradite him
back to the States for trial.

15:12.290 --> 15:15.292
General, I'm happy to hunt Gaez
with Chuck and Casey, but...

15:15.359 --> 15:16.827
Langley said all available hands.

15:16.894 --> 15:18.328
Carina, due to your injury,

15:18.329 --> 15:21.131
you will monitor the mission and
provide support from Castle.

15:21.199 --> 15:23.550
Chuck and Casey, you're shadowing the Cats.

15:23.634 --> 15:24.835
It's Carnival in Rio.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.870
Gaez will throw a big party--
he does every year.

15:26.938 --> 15:28.738
It'll be heavily guarded,

15:28.806 --> 15:30.574
but I'm sure we can find our way in.

15:30.641 --> 15:31.775
I love it.

15:31.776 --> 15:33.143
General, we're not a team anymore.

15:33.144 --> 15:35.111
This comes from the top, Sarah.

15:35.179 --> 15:38.014
The Cats are back.

15:43.404 --> 15:45.021
So, hey, Rio!

15:45.072 --> 15:47.190
Sun, sand-- that's... that's good, right?

15:47.258 --> 15:50.126
Chuck, you know that tracking
device I found in Zondra's boot?

15:50.194 --> 15:53.396
We were on a mission to nail Augusto Gaez.

15:53.464 --> 15:56.299
Uh... come on, you think that
Zondra's working for Gaez,

15:56.367 --> 15:57.701
that she planted the bomb?

15:57.702 --> 15:59.052
The government cleared her name.

15:59.053 --> 16:00.687
Yeah, we'll see.

16:08.312 --> 16:09.579
Yes?

16:09.580 --> 16:12.883
The CAT Squad is on their way to Rio.

16:12.950 --> 16:14.317
Excellent.

16:14.318 --> 16:17.020
The plan is going perfectly.

16:25.883 --> 16:27.517
We're going on a mission again!

16:27.584 --> 16:28.985
CAT Squad high-five!

16:32.723 --> 16:34.190
You guys are zero fun.

16:34.191 --> 16:35.842
Hey, Sarah.

16:35.910 --> 16:37.360
I have an idea.

16:37.361 --> 16:39.312
Look, Chuck, I know that
you have good intentions,

16:39.396 --> 16:41.448
but can we please ease up on the ideas?

16:41.532 --> 16:43.450
This is a solid idea; hear me out.

16:43.534 --> 16:45.668
Look, I'm gonna be stuck
in a van with Casey,

16:45.736 --> 16:47.604
which gives me plenty of time to review

16:47.671 --> 16:50.106
all the CIA files on both
the CAT Squad and Gaez

16:50.174 --> 16:51.641
and run 'em through the old computer.

16:51.642 --> 16:52.909
If Zondra turns out to be

16:52.910 --> 16:54.544
a double agent,
we take her down with Augusto.

16:54.611 --> 16:57.130
But if she turns out to be innocent,
you guys can be friends again

16:57.214 --> 16:59.215
and-and reconnect in a real way--
maybe I can

16:59.283 --> 17:01.384
help you fix this.
Look, it doesn't really matter

17:01.452 --> 17:03.803
whether or not I have friends
at my engagement party.

17:03.888 --> 17:05.387
I'm talking the big picture here.

17:05.454 --> 17:07.339
I'm talking you engaging with your past.

17:07.424 --> 17:09.659
Okay.

17:09.727 --> 17:11.176
Okay.

17:13.897 --> 17:15.798
I can just see that little hamster wheel

17:15.849 --> 17:17.317
turning in your head, Walker.

17:17.401 --> 17:19.486
All I'm thinking about is nailing Gaez.

17:19.569 --> 17:21.488
Hm. Well, you just make sure

17:21.571 --> 17:24.073
you keep your paws out of my boot heels.

17:24.141 --> 17:25.575
Oh, you want to start that again?

17:25.643 --> 17:27.643
Yes, I do.

17:27.694 --> 17:29.362
Hey, hey. Cool it, Cats.

17:29.446 --> 17:30.746
Hm?

17:34.151 --> 17:36.319
You rang, Casey?

17:36.387 --> 17:38.171
Is it hot in here, or is it me?

17:38.255 --> 17:40.206
Carina's assigned to Castle.

17:40.291 --> 17:41.424
Make sure she has

17:41.425 --> 17:43.593
I.T. support, food, whatever she needs.

17:43.660 --> 17:45.728
No, no, listen to me,
I- I can't be alone here

17:45.796 --> 17:47.430
with that woman, okay? She...

17:47.497 --> 17:48.932
she wants me.

17:48.999 --> 17:50.516
Badly.

17:52.636 --> 17:55.371
John, she desires my physical person.

17:55.439 --> 17:57.707
And I'm hunting unicorns.

17:57.775 --> 17:59.342
You're baby-sitting. Get over it.

17:59.393 --> 18:01.060
I have intel on Gaez's Carnival party.

18:01.145 --> 18:03.029
He'll be at Cabaret Soco Na Garganta.

18:03.113 --> 18:04.447
Near the Sambadrome.

18:04.448 --> 18:07.567
The only question now is,
how do we breach security?

18:07.651 --> 18:10.036
Disguise or commando entry?

18:10.120 --> 18:11.454
Guys?

18:11.455 --> 18:14.357
Duh. It's a party.

18:24.701 --> 18:27.203
How do Brazilian spies
work with all this noise?

18:27.271 --> 18:29.038
Casey, we're in the club.

18:29.106 --> 18:31.057
Do you have the signal?

18:31.141 --> 18:33.109
Camera's up.

18:42.653 --> 18:44.737
No sign of Gaez.

18:44.822 --> 18:46.856
He won't show till later.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.409
I know his habits.

18:49.410 --> 18:51.728
I've been keeping tabs on The Hand,
just in case.

18:51.795 --> 18:53.562
Convenient.

18:53.614 --> 18:55.531
We can cover more ground if we split up.

18:55.583 --> 18:58.167
Well, I'm not sure if I'm
comfortable with you on your own.

18:58.235 --> 19:00.536
I'm not sure I care.

19:00.588 --> 19:02.288
Huh. Good.

19:02.373 --> 19:03.840
This is a hornets' nest.

19:03.907 --> 19:06.292
Let's just do our job.

19:24.895 --> 19:28.815
Uh... you know, the CIA's gone
over that a hundred times.

19:28.899 --> 19:31.034
The findings were inconclusive.

19:31.101 --> 19:32.935
Get over it. Look, eight years ago

19:33.003 --> 19:35.571
the Cats got yanked into a
Gentle Hand mission in Milan,

19:35.639 --> 19:37.073
but Gaez escaped before the girls

19:37.074 --> 19:38.341
ever made it to Italy.

19:38.342 --> 19:39.676
Uh-huh. So I figured out

19:39.677 --> 19:41.844
that Gaez was tipped off
from a CIA safe house

19:41.912 --> 19:43.446
inside Milan, so if I can prove

19:43.514 --> 19:45.448
that Zondra wasn't in said safe house,

19:45.516 --> 19:47.166
maybe Sarah will be able to trust her again.

19:47.251 --> 19:49.819
You know, I used to be like you.

19:49.887 --> 19:52.822
Wanted to fix everything.

19:52.890 --> 19:54.290
Not now.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.825
Grimes

19:55.893 --> 19:59.729
suggested I approach Alex's mom.

19:59.797 --> 20:02.799
I was tempted at first, but...

20:02.866 --> 20:04.801
she's moved on.

20:04.868 --> 20:06.703
So...

20:06.770 --> 20:10.073
Didn't need her life disrupted, and...

20:10.140 --> 20:11.541
I let it lie.

20:25.422 --> 20:26.556
I spotted Gaez.

20:26.557 --> 20:27.924
He's surrounded by muscle.

20:34.498 --> 20:36.766
He's heading into the VIP room.

20:36.834 --> 20:39.668
We can get the layout from Chuck and Casey.

20:39.720 --> 20:42.004
I'm not here to discuss anything
past your immediate needs,

20:42.056 --> 20:43.389
which have been met, so...

20:43.390 --> 20:44.807
I'm gone.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.442
My needs have not been met.

20:46.510 --> 20:48.561
You're upset I never called you back.

20:48.645 --> 20:50.613
Look, I'm sorry. Get over it.

20:50.681 --> 20:52.515
Oh, I'm over it, sweetheart.

20:52.566 --> 20:54.384
Yeah, yeah. And I'm with someone.

20:54.451 --> 20:56.285
Some...

20:56.353 --> 20:58.454
Oh. The girl at the door.

20:58.522 --> 21:01.023
So, uh, you've told her you love her?

21:01.091 --> 21:03.159
Yeah, of... hey...

21:03.210 --> 21:05.395
No. No. But I-I was going to,

21:05.462 --> 21:07.630
and then her father got
thrown from the roof.

21:07.697 --> 21:09.298
I plan to do it, very, very soon,

21:09.366 --> 21:11.667
and I just... What are you...
So it's not even serious.

21:11.719 --> 21:13.236
Huh? Look...

21:14.938 --> 21:16.472
Excuse me.

21:17.474 --> 21:18.641
It's Alex.

21:18.642 --> 21:20.676
Oh, she's at the Buy More.

21:20.728 --> 21:21.844
Listen to me, I have to go.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.646
Uh-uh, you're staying.

21:23.714 --> 21:25.982
You don't like it,
take it up with General Beckman.

21:26.049 --> 21:28.651
You got to be kidding me.

21:28.719 --> 21:32.739
S- So... you're at the Buy More and I'm not.

21:32.823 --> 21:34.490
N- No...

21:34.558 --> 21:36.292
you do not appear to be.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.295
Yeah, yeah, and I-I don't
think that's gonna...

21:39.363 --> 21:40.596
change anytime soon.

21:40.597 --> 21:41.864
'Cause I got shanghaied

21:41.865 --> 21:44.917
into... baby-sitting this injured agent.

21:45.002 --> 21:47.336
Oh.

21:47.404 --> 21:48.871
So you're, um...

21:48.872 --> 21:51.607
you're canceling on me again?

21:51.675 --> 21:53.259
You're needed. Ah!

21:53.343 --> 21:55.044
Now.

21:55.095 --> 21:56.412
Uh, one sec. One second.

21:56.413 --> 21:58.214
Would you please...

21:58.282 --> 21:59.348
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.384
But I am going to make it up to you.

22:01.452 --> 22:02.885
Whatever you want. Dinner, movie...?

22:02.953 --> 22:04.053
I owe you,

22:04.054 --> 22:05.054
so huge.

22:05.055 --> 22:08.124
Yes, you do owe me.

22:08.192 --> 22:10.193
I will be in touch.

22:10.260 --> 22:11.461
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

22:13.363 --> 22:15.565
If you're done slobbering,

22:15.632 --> 22:17.533
Grimes, there is a problem in Rio.

22:21.538 --> 22:24.490
Um, can I asks you a question?

22:26.844 --> 22:28.410
Is your insurance paid up?

22:33.750 --> 22:35.117
Ready? Yeah, I'm ready.

22:35.118 --> 22:36.685
I'm ready!

22:42.726 --> 22:44.360
Chuck, Casey.

22:44.428 --> 22:46.162
NSA monitored a call from Burbank

22:46.230 --> 22:47.263
to Augusto Gaez yesterday.

22:47.264 --> 22:48.564
Gaez knows the Cats are coming.

22:48.565 --> 22:51.484
It's a trap, guys. Abort now.

22:51.568 --> 22:53.235
Sarah, you have to get out of there.

23:00.661 --> 23:03.412
It's been a long time, Cats.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.948
Drop your weapons, or die.

23:10.943 --> 23:13.595
All these years.

23:13.679 --> 23:15.096
Enemies,

23:15.181 --> 23:18.216
fighting each other.

23:19.552 --> 23:20.969
Such a waste, no?

23:20.970 --> 23:23.138
You're the bad guy, Augusto.
That's how it works.

23:23.222 --> 23:24.755
Says who?

23:24.807 --> 23:26.524
Why can't we work together?

23:28.928 --> 23:30.728
That's why we're here?

23:30.779 --> 23:32.280
A sales pitch?

23:32.364 --> 23:34.482
The worldwide market for The Gentle Hand

23:34.567 --> 23:36.701
has blown wide open.

23:36.769 --> 23:39.103
I need skilled operatives

23:39.171 --> 23:41.906
who can open a door with a fist.

23:41.957 --> 23:43.908
Or a smile.

23:43.976 --> 23:45.710
Kitty, kitty, kitties.

23:45.777 --> 23:48.847
You have been lured here
to accept a career...

23:48.914 --> 23:50.748
with The Hand.

23:50.816 --> 23:53.852
Or I'll bury you on Mount Corcovado.

23:58.824 --> 24:00.124
Casey?

24:00.125 --> 24:01.926
They're tied up. Five guards, all armed.

24:01.994 --> 24:03.995
I'm going to use the Intersect
to drop down and capture Gaez.

24:04.063 --> 24:06.181
Just going to drop down
out of the sky, huh, hero?

24:06.265 --> 24:07.732
Don't you think you're overcompensating

24:07.799 --> 24:09.100
'cause you got your
girlfriend's car blown up?

24:09.101 --> 24:10.368
That is not true.

24:10.369 --> 24:12.604
You just sit tight,
till I give you the signal.

24:12.655 --> 24:14.338
Remember, you only have a tranq gun.

24:15.608 --> 24:17.442
A career in The Hand?

24:17.493 --> 24:18.910
With you and who else, Augusto?

24:18.911 --> 24:20.879
Because you've already
got one of us, don't you?

24:20.946 --> 24:23.014
Do I, Sarah?

24:23.082 --> 24:25.750
Why don't you let her
finish the sales pitch?

24:25.818 --> 24:27.085
Why don't you shut up?

24:27.086 --> 24:28.953
No, I would like the air cleared,
once and for all.

24:29.021 --> 24:31.589
Sarah, let's just get out of this alive. No.

24:31.657 --> 24:32.824
Let her say my name.

24:32.825 --> 24:35.059
Offer me up, Walker.

24:35.127 --> 24:36.494
Accuse me out loud, instead of

24:36.495 --> 24:38.596
under your breath like
you've been doing for years.

24:38.664 --> 24:40.632
That's exactly what you've been doing to me,

24:40.683 --> 24:42.300
telling people that I put
the tracker in your boot?

24:44.703 --> 24:47.272
The suspense is a killer, no?

24:47.339 --> 24:50.174
Maybe it's not tough Zondra.

24:51.176 --> 24:53.311
Maybe sweet Amy?

24:53.379 --> 24:54.779
Suspicious.

24:54.780 --> 24:58.049
But so is Sarah Walker,

24:58.117 --> 25:00.585
the kitty who doth protest too much.

25:00.653 --> 25:01.886
You know it's not me,

25:01.887 --> 25:03.221
and I've got no intention of joining up,

25:03.222 --> 25:04.555
So if you plan to kill us,

25:04.556 --> 25:06.024
you may as well tell me the truth.

25:07.393 --> 25:08.993
I think that's fair.

25:11.964 --> 25:13.631
I'd rather just kill you.

25:16.335 --> 25:18.002
Casey? Casey, this just got ugly.

25:23.175 --> 25:24.542
You're done, Gaez.

25:24.543 --> 25:25.843
Now, do you want to live,
or do you want to die?

25:25.844 --> 25:27.145
Keep cool.

25:27.146 --> 25:29.247
We are all... keeping cool.

25:29.315 --> 25:30.782
You're going to tell me
exactly what I want to know

25:30.849 --> 25:32.517
or you're the one getting
buried on Mount Corcovado.

25:32.584 --> 25:35.420
Okay.

25:35.487 --> 25:36.988
The name is... Yeah?

25:37.056 --> 25:38.589
Okay.

25:38.657 --> 25:41.609
I'll tell you. I think...
I think Sarah needs help.

25:58.127 --> 25:59.644
Ha, ha!

26:02.431 --> 26:05.183
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Damn it.

26:05.250 --> 26:06.718
I need immediate extraction.

26:06.769 --> 26:08.953
Any way you can. Plane, boat, car...

26:09.021 --> 26:11.189
How about fist?

26:11.256 --> 26:13.107
I've got Gaez. Let's get out of here.

26:13.192 --> 26:15.610
Wait. Wait.

26:15.694 --> 26:17.312
He was about to tell me
the name of the mole.

26:17.396 --> 26:20.148
Now that he's in custody, he'll never talk.

26:20.232 --> 26:23.034
I was... I was just... I was...
I was helping. I was helping.

26:23.101 --> 26:25.303
Look, look. Look, look,
look at all the bad guys I tranq'd.

26:25.371 --> 26:26.771
I don't need help with my job,

26:26.772 --> 26:28.106
and I don't need help with my past,

26:28.107 --> 26:29.273
so stop trying to help me, okay?

26:29.274 --> 26:30.641
I don't need help!

26:31.944 --> 26:32.943
No, no, no!

26:38.384 --> 26:40.501
I deserved that.

26:40.586 --> 26:44.188
Excellent work in Rio,
in spite of the hiccups.

26:44.256 --> 26:45.857
But, Sarah, you were right.

26:45.924 --> 26:47.492
There's a traitor in the Cats.

26:47.559 --> 26:49.143
Well, you know who my money's on.
Personally, I always thought

26:49.228 --> 26:51.162
that Carina had a shifty look in her eye.

26:51.230 --> 26:52.630
Honestly, how well do you know Amy?

26:52.631 --> 26:54.565
I mean, is anyone really that perky?

26:54.633 --> 26:55.933
Conjecture and ill will

26:55.934 --> 26:58.036
do not make a case for treason.
We need facts,

26:58.103 --> 26:59.237
and until we have them,

26:59.238 --> 27:00.738
I want the Cats to stay in Castle.

27:00.806 --> 27:02.874
Casey, interrogate Gaez for the mole.

27:02.941 --> 27:04.375
You're dismissed.

27:06.995 --> 27:08.780
I have a job for you.

27:12.051 --> 27:13.251
Attention, shoppers.

27:13.252 --> 27:15.953
The Buy More will be
closing in five minutes.

27:17.790 --> 27:19.624
Hello, beautiful.

27:19.691 --> 27:22.326
Do I have the night of
nights planned for you.

27:22.378 --> 27:24.762
First of all, we are...

27:24.830 --> 27:26.264
What? What?

27:26.265 --> 27:28.266
Lipstick on your collar?

27:30.836 --> 27:33.271
Oh, that dirty, little...

27:33.338 --> 27:34.605
Whose lipstick is it?

27:34.606 --> 27:36.374
The wounded agent?

27:36.442 --> 27:37.892
Miss French Toast?

27:37.893 --> 27:40.078
She obviously rubbed it
in to sabotage our date.

27:40.145 --> 27:41.312
She has the soul

27:41.313 --> 27:43.114
of a bridge troll.

27:43.182 --> 27:45.550
I really want to believe you, Morgan,

27:45.617 --> 27:48.419
but you have been acting so strange.

27:48.487 --> 27:50.521
And three times in a row?

27:50.589 --> 27:52.790
That is asking a little too much.

27:52.858 --> 27:54.876
Okay. Oh, yes. Oh, but Alex.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.061
Alex? But...

27:57.129 --> 27:58.729
you trust me, remember?

27:58.797 --> 28:00.798
Do I?

28:05.337 --> 28:07.204
The Cats left their
luggage at our apartment.

28:07.256 --> 28:09.040
There might be another tracking
device in their things,

28:09.108 --> 28:10.725
and I don't want anything leading home.

28:10.809 --> 28:13.210
Great. Sounds like you're
trying to get rid of me.

28:13.262 --> 28:16.047
Look, I know I screwed up, Sarah, but...

28:16.115 --> 28:17.598
Okay, fine. Fine, fine, fine.

28:17.683 --> 28:19.049
But look, I did some analysis

28:19.050 --> 28:20.651
on the Cats' failed mission to Milan,

28:20.719 --> 28:22.086
and it seems very suspect.

28:22.087 --> 28:23.271
It's not totally conclusive,

28:23.272 --> 28:24.655
but if we can figure out

28:24.656 --> 28:25.990
who actually was in Milan...

28:25.991 --> 28:27.458
You're still helping. Stop.

28:27.526 --> 28:28.626
Now.

28:28.627 --> 28:31.462
No. Sarah, but...

28:31.530 --> 28:32.864
Hey, Walker.

28:32.865 --> 28:34.665
I'm not running anywhere.

28:34.733 --> 28:37.001
You know what? In fact, I am sick and tired

28:37.068 --> 28:38.503
of pussying around.

28:38.570 --> 28:40.588
So why don't we settle this old-school?

28:40.672 --> 28:41.839
Toe-to-toe?

28:41.840 --> 28:44.709
Yeah, let's do it.

29:03.812 --> 29:06.063
Still got that jab, Walker.

29:06.114 --> 29:07.698
Yeah? Mm-hmm.

29:07.766 --> 29:09.300
You want some more?

29:11.703 --> 29:13.704
Got some questions for you, Gaez.

29:17.576 --> 29:20.111
What is she here for?

29:20.179 --> 29:21.646
Muscle.

29:21.713 --> 29:24.165
I thought it might be fun.

29:26.618 --> 29:28.052
Ouch.

29:29.054 --> 29:30.621
Shall we begin?

29:43.769 --> 29:45.369
I have never even heard
of an organization called

29:45.437 --> 29:47.605
"The Gentle Hand."

29:47.673 --> 29:50.041
I'm a businessman.

29:50.108 --> 29:52.210
Yeah. Business in terror.

29:52.277 --> 29:54.812
Built a fortune, killed a lot of men.

29:56.315 --> 29:57.615
But that all ends now.

30:03.655 --> 30:04.822
I'm not the traitor.

30:04.823 --> 30:06.224
I didn't plant that tracker.

30:08.093 --> 30:10.027
Neither did I. Then where did it come from?

30:10.095 --> 30:11.662
Huh? You were the only one in Milan.

30:11.730 --> 30:13.214
I was never in Milan on that mission.

30:13.298 --> 30:15.349
I was supposed to be,
but I got an anonymous call

30:15.434 --> 30:17.068
to stay put in Paris.

30:17.135 --> 30:18.603
We need to disc--

30:20.005 --> 30:22.557
You just gonna primp?

30:32.150 --> 30:33.284
One of us had to have been in Milan.

30:33.285 --> 30:34.735
Carina was in the U.S.

30:34.820 --> 30:36.370
I read it in Chuck's report.

30:39.658 --> 30:41.208
That leaves...

30:41.293 --> 30:42.126
Amy.

30:46.665 --> 30:47.698
Traitor. Yeah.

30:47.699 --> 30:49.634
So what? I paid for it.

30:49.701 --> 30:51.602
Acting like the world's biggest dope.

30:51.670 --> 30:53.638
Wearing stupid sexed-up costumes

30:53.705 --> 30:55.006
to fight world crime.

30:55.007 --> 30:58.075
Now I have everything I ever dreamed of,

30:58.143 --> 31:00.511
except it is a little lonely.

31:00.579 --> 31:01.846
Join me.

31:01.847 --> 31:03.264
Go to hell.

31:06.184 --> 31:07.985
I know where you live, Walker.

31:08.053 --> 31:09.153
You even think

31:09.154 --> 31:11.255
of trying to find us, remember,

31:11.323 --> 31:12.607
there's a target on your back.

31:12.608 --> 31:16.077
You, Chuck, the sister with the baby.

31:16.161 --> 31:18.268
Don't forget.

31:27.978 --> 31:29.879
Chuck?

31:34.685 --> 31:36.686
Can you think about making two trips?

31:39.223 --> 31:40.523
Not really my style.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.392
How's the reunion going?

31:44.862 --> 31:47.530
Doesn't everybody want their
friends and family around them?

31:47.598 --> 31:49.065
I mean, wouldn't you have been disappointed

31:49.066 --> 31:50.767
if there hadn't been one friend

31:50.835 --> 31:53.136
or family member at your wedding?

31:53.204 --> 31:54.571
Yeah.

31:54.572 --> 31:57.240
But maybe Sarah sees the world differently.

31:57.308 --> 32:00.844
I just want to make her happy,
and everything I did backfired.

32:00.911 --> 32:03.880
Chuck, you bend over
backwards to help people.

32:03.948 --> 32:06.349
It's one of the reasons
that you're so easy to love,

32:06.417 --> 32:09.185
but sometimes the best thing you can do

32:09.253 --> 32:10.420
is just take a step back.

32:10.421 --> 32:12.889
Be understanding.

32:12.957 --> 32:15.091
You don't have to fix everything.

32:15.159 --> 32:17.060
So I blew it?

32:17.128 --> 32:19.295
Big time.

32:20.698 --> 32:22.332
But I'm pretty sure she still loves you.

32:26.337 --> 32:27.871
Where is she? Okay, listen, I don't know

32:27.922 --> 32:29.906
what it's gonna take to
get it through that thick

32:29.957 --> 32:31.040
spy skull of yours,

32:31.041 --> 32:32.258
but you need to understand something.

32:32.259 --> 32:33.877
You are not the only game in town,

32:33.944 --> 32:35.512
and I am in love with somebody else.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.580
You really are angry. You're damn right

32:37.648 --> 32:39.081
I am, okay, and I'm through with you,

32:39.133 --> 32:40.300
and I'm through being your slave.

32:40.301 --> 32:42.352
Wow. You're so worked up.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.354
I guess you really do love her, huh?

32:44.421 --> 32:45.855
<i>You guess? You guess...</i>

32:45.923 --> 32:47.690
You're supposed to be
an intelligence officer,

32:47.758 --> 32:49.091
and you guess?

32:49.092 --> 32:51.628
Well, you haven't said it to her.
I just figured.

32:51.695 --> 32:53.263
You figured wrong, all right?

32:53.330 --> 32:56.499
Although... I really should tell her.

32:56.567 --> 32:58.501
I do love her.

32:58.569 --> 32:59.936
Oh.

32:59.937 --> 33:01.621
Oh, shut up. I'm gonna go get her back.

33:01.705 --> 33:04.657
If you need anything else,
you can go to hell.

33:04.742 --> 33:06.075
Marty, don't move!

33:06.076 --> 33:07.544
Marty. Here we... It's Morgan!

33:07.611 --> 33:09.329
How many times do I got...?

33:12.750 --> 33:14.751
Sorry, puss. Sleep time.

33:29.733 --> 33:31.684
Come on, Chuck, pick up.

33:39.643 --> 33:41.678
Sarah, I am the idiot of the century.

33:41.745 --> 33:43.713
Chuck, Amy just escaped with Gaez.

33:43.781 --> 33:45.331
She's the traitor. Where are you?

33:45.416 --> 33:47.333
I'm at the Buy More. The store is closed.

33:47.418 --> 33:48.518
Where are you?

33:48.519 --> 33:49.819
We're locked down in Castle,

33:49.820 --> 33:51.320
but trying to override the system.

33:51.372 --> 33:52.705
Gaez and Amy

33:52.706 --> 33:53.556
are headed your way.

33:53.557 --> 33:54.624
They're in the elevator.

33:54.625 --> 33:56.325
Okay, listen.

33:56.377 --> 33:57.427
Do not try and fight them.

33:57.428 --> 33:58.461
Just hold tight,

33:58.462 --> 33:59.796
and we'll be right there.

33:59.797 --> 34:01.631
Yeah, well, there's no real time for that.

34:01.682 --> 34:04.500
Okay? Just stay by the
monitors and spot them for me.

34:04.552 --> 34:06.836
Lockdown engaged.

34:10.391 --> 34:11.608
He's a dead man.

34:11.609 --> 34:12.859
Well, he's got a plan.

34:12.860 --> 34:14.310
At least, I think he does.

34:16.864 --> 34:18.281
God, is he shopping? What's he doing?

34:20.784 --> 34:23.018
Hey, they're following you.
You've got ten seconds.

34:23.087 --> 34:24.871
Well, can I just take these ten seconds

34:24.955 --> 34:26.656
to apologize for being such a fool?

34:26.724 --> 34:28.424
Chuck, now's not the time.

34:31.728 --> 34:33.913
Chuck?

34:35.416 --> 34:36.748
Give us the key to the store,

34:36.750 --> 34:38.668
and we're gone for good.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.202
You're no match for us, and you know it.

34:40.254 --> 34:41.588
We don't want to hurt you,

34:41.589 --> 34:45.041
but we will certainly enjoy
doing it if we have to.

34:51.431 --> 34:52.782
Talk to me, Sarah. Where are they?

34:52.783 --> 34:55.083
They're at the Nerd Herd desk.

34:55.152 --> 34:57.820
Okay, I just want to say
that I have no intention

34:57.888 --> 34:59.789
of opening up any more cans of worms,

34:59.857 --> 35:01.591
or Pandora's boxes or
anything else like that.

35:01.659 --> 35:03.109
I just want you to be happy.

35:03.193 --> 35:05.227
Okay, please just concentrate
on getting out of this alive.

35:05.279 --> 35:06.663
Well, that would a lot easier

35:06.664 --> 35:08.164
if I knew you'd consider forgiving me.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.865
No time for that. They're headed your way.

35:46.987 --> 35:49.272
Oh!

35:49.340 --> 35:51.307
Oh!

35:51.375 --> 35:53.209
I don't like fighting girls.

35:55.996 --> 35:57.046
I mean, women.

35:57.047 --> 35:58.881
I was taught to be a gentleman.

36:14.531 --> 36:17.400
Going somewhere...

36:17.468 --> 36:19.535
pussy?

36:33.241 --> 36:35.709
Small price to pay to find the real traitor.

36:35.794 --> 36:39.363
Yeah, took us long enough.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.798
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.535
I should have never jumped to conclusions.

36:44.603 --> 36:47.238
Me, neither. It cost us a lot of years.

36:47.305 --> 36:49.073
Yeah.

36:50.308 --> 36:52.343
We could try to make up for it.

36:52.410 --> 36:53.611
We were good friends.

36:53.612 --> 36:54.979
I miss that.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.614
Yeah.

36:56.681 --> 37:00.050
Well, there is, uh,
this... engagement party.

37:00.118 --> 37:01.952
I'll be there.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.787
Me, too. I have an apology to make.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.256
I would love to have you guys.

37:05.323 --> 37:07.208
At the wedding, too, if you can make it.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.494
Maybe you... you could be bridesmaids?

37:12.797 --> 37:15.049
I've never been a bridesmaid.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.635
Well, pretended to once for a mission.

37:17.702 --> 37:18.969
I did, too, once,

37:18.970 --> 37:21.105
but there was a machine gun
under the pink taffeta.

37:21.172 --> 37:22.506
Oh.

37:22.507 --> 37:24.975
Well, maybe we can try
it for real this time.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.710
Mm.

37:26.778 --> 37:28.111
No machine guns.

37:29.047 --> 37:32.483
Scary, but I'll give it a shot.

37:32.550 --> 37:34.051
All right.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.419
Okay.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.608
Hey.

37:41.610 --> 37:43.494
Can I just...?

37:43.561 --> 37:45.663
Chuck, no more apologies.

37:46.731 --> 37:48.582
I- I want to say thank you.

37:48.667 --> 37:51.769
I'm really glad that the
girls are here tonight,

37:51.836 --> 37:53.437
and that they'll be here for the wedding.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.472
I'm just not ready to

37:55.540 --> 37:57.408
dive into my past right now.

37:57.475 --> 37:59.677
Yeah. No way. Nuh-uh.

37:59.744 --> 38:02.179
And my family...

38:02.247 --> 38:04.748
Well, there's no misunderstanding

38:04.816 --> 38:06.750
to straighten out, really.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.152
I know that it's complicated.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.887
I totally hear you. I-I do.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.689
And I'm done helping out.

38:11.756 --> 38:14.692
No, Chuck, please don't
ever stop helping me.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.226
There are a thousand ways

38:16.278 --> 38:18.279
that I need your help every single day,

38:18.363 --> 38:19.997
and you're perfect.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.201
Well, then I'll stick to those.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.323
Mmm.

38:29.324 --> 38:31.992
Let's party.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.078
Let's do it.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.992
I want to start.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.677
Okay.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.679
We're, um...

39:08.747 --> 39:10.331
We're done.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.449
It's not that I think you were unfaithful.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.867
I just...

39:13.868 --> 39:16.837
I mean, leggy girls,

39:16.921 --> 39:18.856
getting half the truth...

39:18.923 --> 39:20.357
I don't fit into

39:20.425 --> 39:21.925
this world.

39:21.993 --> 39:25.512
I can count the amount of
special relationships I've had

39:25.597 --> 39:27.131
on half of one hand.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.565
Me, too.

39:28.566 --> 39:31.719
Then why don't I feel special, Morgan?

39:31.803 --> 39:34.304
I just feel lied to.

39:36.057 --> 39:39.610
I'm sorry.

39:41.646 --> 39:44.014
No, hold on. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

39:44.065 --> 39:46.033
Hear me out, okay?

39:46.117 --> 39:48.685
The reason I kept Carina a secret from you

39:48.753 --> 39:51.121
is because I didn't know

39:51.189 --> 39:52.906
how to handle you running into someone

39:52.991 --> 39:55.759
I'd had a... a relationship with.

39:55.827 --> 39:59.063
To be honest, there have been so few that

39:59.130 --> 40:00.831
it was damn near a
statistical impossibility.

40:05.503 --> 40:07.337
I want you to know something, though.

40:07.389 --> 40:09.506
Nothing happened between us,

40:09.557 --> 40:12.443
because nothing means more
to me than this relationship.

40:12.510 --> 40:15.479
I would never do anything to threaten that.

40:15.547 --> 40:16.713
Ever.

40:16.714 --> 40:19.149
I love you.

40:19.217 --> 40:20.934
I love you.

40:23.188 --> 40:24.788
I am in love with you.

40:24.856 --> 40:29.109
Like, for real, "I love you"?

40:29.194 --> 40:31.161
Oh, for real I love you, I love you.

40:31.229 --> 40:34.364
I love you, too.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.300
But you cannot do this.

40:36.367 --> 40:39.036
I won't. I promise.

40:45.427 --> 40:47.377
I think I owe you an apology.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.513
I acted like a real...

40:49.581 --> 40:51.348
It's okay.

40:51.416 --> 40:53.416
He loves me.

40:58.807 --> 41:01.191
Hi. This is lovely.

41:01.259 --> 41:03.527
Oh. I'm so glad that you think so.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.929
I'm just really happy being here in a dress

41:05.980 --> 41:07.481
and having a little wine.

41:07.565 --> 41:09.566
So...

41:11.603 --> 41:13.670
What's on your mind?

41:13.738 --> 41:16.707
Oh.

41:16.774 --> 41:21.044
Must be hard... being
here without your family.

41:21.112 --> 41:22.646
Yeah, well, I'm...

41:22.714 --> 41:24.648
I don't really know where my father is,

41:24.716 --> 41:27.217
and I have a very strained
relationship with my mother,

41:27.285 --> 41:28.785
so, it's...

41:28.837 --> 41:30.120
Complicated?

41:30.121 --> 41:31.455
Yeah.

41:31.456 --> 41:33.624
How about you and I talk about this?

41:33.691 --> 41:35.559
We can get Chuck involved later.

41:35.627 --> 41:37.361
That would be great. Thank you.

41:37.428 --> 41:38.962
We're practically family, right?

41:39.030 --> 41:40.264
Yeah.

41:40.265 --> 41:41.798
More importantly, though, we're friends.

41:41.866 --> 41:43.400
Yeah.

41:44.569 --> 41:46.937
Well, I-I have a question for you.

41:48.473 --> 41:51.742
I was wondering if you
would be my maid of honor.

41:51.809 --> 41:53.210
Seriously?

41:53.278 --> 41:54.644
Yeah.

41:54.645 --> 41:56.830
Oh, I would love to. Of course.
