09:48.970 --> 09:56.259
with me this weekend

09:50.379 --> 09:58.740
one suitcase or two

09:56.259 --> 10:01.080
why

09:58.740 --> 10:02.549
but we have to tell everyone that we're

10:01.080 --> 10:07.230
going to a conference on drowning

10:02.549 --> 10:09.359
worried about your reputation

10:07.230 --> 10:13.259
no I just don't want the team gossiping

10:09.360 --> 10:15.180
that song mhm you see I don't sneak

10:13.259 --> 10:16.740
around I'm gonna do something I do it

10:15.179 --> 10:18.750
let the chips fall where they may

10:16.740 --> 10:20.310
I'm not saying we sneak around i'm just

10:18.750 --> 10:22.379
saying we don't tell anyone that's all

10:20.309 --> 10:24.778
look it's like you're going to a

10:22.379 --> 10:29.570
conference on drowning just so happens

10:24.778 --> 10:31.720
so mine

10:29.570 --> 10:33.100
ok

10:31.720 --> 10:34.430
ok

10:33.100 --> 10:37.879
ok

10:34.429 --> 11:06.029
I'll play secrets this one time

10:37.879 --> 11:09.629
great

11:06.029 --> 11:14.039
hey Don you have a second I need to talk

11:09.629 --> 11:23.679
to you sure have a seat

11:14.039 --> 11:29.709
thank you

11:23.679 --> 11:33.219
yoga Tantra kamasutra that's quite an

11:29.710 --> 11:35.500
interesting collection about sex

11:33.220 --> 11:39.009
partly it's also all about energy

11:35.500 --> 11:43.208
physical psychic and how to channel it

11:39.009 --> 11:46.149
but it's about sex

11:43.208 --> 11:48.729
well sex is definitely the best example

11:46.149 --> 11:51.129
of the link between the brain and the

11:48.730 --> 11:54.370
body when the two are totally in sync

11:51.129 --> 12:01.509
potential for both mental and physical

11:54.370 --> 12:03.669
satisfaction is multiple so I get

12:01.509 --> 12:07.480
everybody here has a specialty and yours

12:03.669 --> 12:10.809
is about the body is that what you want

12:07.480 --> 12:12.129
to talk to me about no no it's not i

12:10.809 --> 12:13.509
want to talk to you about something that

12:12.129 --> 12:15.189
I'm sure you're gonna find out about

12:13.509 --> 12:16.870
anyway because that's just the way it is

12:15.190 --> 12:17.740
around here and I wanted to tell you

12:16.870 --> 12:21.399
straight out to see if you have a

12:17.740 --> 12:24.370
problem with it and that is about maui

12:21.399 --> 12:25.659
this weekend I'm going with Sean we all

12:24.370 --> 12:28.149
are to the conference

12:25.659 --> 12:30.579
yeah yeah to the conference and yes was

12:28.149 --> 12:34.610
Shawn but not the way that I'm going to

12:30.580 --> 12:37.400
be with Sean

12:34.610 --> 12:44.029
do you have a problem with that

12:37.399 --> 12:45.620
not at all but i'm curious to know why

12:44.029 --> 12:53.509
you think i would have a problem that

12:45.620 --> 12:58.328
nothing specific

12:53.509 --> 13:01.480
that was wrong

12:58.328 --> 13:05.378
oh one more thing Sean doesn't want

13:01.480 --> 13:06.850
anybody to know about this so we keep

13:05.379 --> 13:13.450
this from happening

13:06.850 --> 13:20.830
absolutely

13:13.450 --> 13:23.320
John's going to this conference and now

13:20.830 --> 13:26.530
about ground worldwide mostly

13:23.320 --> 13:28.210
statistical alex is a good idea if we go

13:26.529 --> 13:30.490
with you know to light them up because

13:28.210 --> 13:32.710
as jason says Jones getting really

13:30.490 --> 13:34.450
tightly concentrating so much on a team

13:32.710 --> 13:36.370
and getting ready for the new

13:34.450 --> 13:39.250
international lifeguards to arrive

13:36.370 --> 13:40.269
because when Ali said the centers in

13:39.250 --> 13:43.000
financial trouble

13:40.269 --> 13:45.309
so if you can think of a way to lighten

13:43.000 --> 13:48.970
them up as jason says get him to relax

13:45.309 --> 13:51.369
mind off things you can do that

13:48.970 --> 13:53.350
he just needs to get completely

13:51.370 --> 13:56.080
physically worn out

13:53.350 --> 13:58.450
don't want to work for me yep Jason

13:56.080 --> 14:00.129
things that will work for Shawn to just

13:58.450 --> 14:03.040
get them so involved that he completely

14:00.129 --> 14:04.840
forget about it stress and his problems

14:03.039 --> 14:06.759
well you know that little speech that

14:04.840 --> 14:10.300
Sean gave us how you can get involved

14:06.759 --> 14:12.490
because team i remember well what does

14:10.299 --> 14:15.699
involve really mean to me

14:12.490 --> 14:18.639
we already are about exactly

14:15.700 --> 14:20.710
I think of something I'll leave it with

14:18.639 --> 14:29.139
you

14:20.710 --> 14:30.759
the surface great today in the hand not

14:29.139 --> 14:31.299
i was gonna catch them later on you

14:30.759 --> 14:33.700

14:31.299 --> 14:35.500

14:33.700 --> 14:38.410
we don't get any last minute calls be

14:35.500 --> 14:39.759
there just as the sun sets at hey I had

14:38.409 --> 14:42.579

14:46.570 --> 14:48.610

14:48.610 --> 14:52.300

14:50.590 --> 14:54.340
water it's already sold out

14:52.299 --> 14:56.109
I'm not surprised one of the leading

14:54.340 --> 14:56.860
cause of accidental death in children is

14:56.110 --> 15:01.570
drowning

14:56.860 --> 15:03.610

15:21.360 --> 15:26.129
of Disease Control in Atlanta I remember

15:24.000 --> 15:27.899
it's interesting don't you think I mean

15:26.129 --> 15:31.019
I wouldn't classify drowning as a

15:27.899 --> 15:33.240
disease you know what I she also said

15:31.019 --> 15:35.279
that training is the number one cause of

15:33.240 --> 15:36.840
preventable deaths what-what-what

15:35.279 --> 15:38.370
preventable meeting if they knew how to

15:36.840 --> 15:40.139
swim they wouldn't drown quite

15:38.370 --> 15:41.700
simplistic well that's why I want to go

15:40.139 --> 15:42.539
to this meeting want to see how she ties

15:41.700 --> 15:45.960
it all together

talk to you about is I may have to speak

18:19.170 --> 18:26.999
convention

18:23.788 --> 18:29.999
then make it personal

18:26.999 --> 18:31.108
I mean you know what I mean I didn't

18:29.999 --> 18:32.788
take the International lifeguard

18:31.108 --> 18:33.749
training center seriously until I felt

18:32.788 --> 18:39.740
your passion

18:33.749 --> 18:42.620

18:39.740 --> 18:44.480

18:42.619 --> 18:46.279
them why you became a lifeguard let them

18:44.480 --> 18:47.720
know why you do this Shawn will give you

18:46.279 --> 18:51.200
all the support you need

18:47.720 --> 18:53.029

18:51.200 --> 18:58.789
nobody's gonna think any less of you

18:53.029 --> 19:00.558
because your sender I i know you said

18:58.789 --> 19:01.970
not to mention a shot if you want your

19:00.558 --> 19:02.960
dream to succeed you got to let people

in

19:02.960 --> 19:07.279
let them know your heart look I don't

19:04.609 --> 19:09.079

21:01.079 --> 21:07.710
hotel and which one with that someone

21:05.670 --> 21:09.720
who likes to keep a very low profile

21:07.710 --> 21:51.950
especially when it has to do with Sean's

21:09.720 --> 21:58.038
best interest

21:51.950 --> 21:59.179
I decided to take your advice I thought

36:02.588 --> 36:08.440
I know what you know I just got a

36:04.300 --> 36:14.450
message saying Sean want to see us here

36:08.440 --> 36:21.500
he comes

36:14.449 --> 36:22.639
i guess thanks for coming so in about an

36:21.500 --> 36:24.710
hour i'm going to be giving a

36:22.639 --> 36:25.578
presentation to the conference on

36:24.710 --> 36:27.108
drowning

36:25.579 --> 36:29.060
basically I'm just talking about the

36:27.108 --> 36:32.119
training center and why it's important

36:29.059 --> 36:37.369
and why we need their support

36:32.119 --> 36:40.280
it's been suggested to me that i make my

36:37.369 --> 36:42.170
presentation personal I let them know

36:40.280 --> 36:49.190
and everyone know what's in my heart

36:42.170 --> 36:52.159
that kind of indulgence doesn't it

36:49.190 --> 36:54.559
doesn't come easily for me and as I was

36:52.159 --> 36:56.118
struggling with what i would say some

36:54.559 --> 36:58.519
things occurred to me and I just wanted

36:56.119 --> 37:00.619
to run them by you for your advice and

36:58.519 --> 37:03.949
feedback arm

37:00.619 --> 37:22.039
some of you may know i think that most

37:03.949 --> 37:25.269
of you don't I have a son and he drowned

37:22.039 --> 37:29.349
I'm sorry

37:25.269 --> 37:37.869
he was too and his name was James

37:29.349 --> 37:43.509
Patrick Munro and he he he was my heart

37:37.869 --> 37:46.239
and his death changed every aspect of my

37:43.510 --> 37:51.310
life and as I prepared to tell the

37:46.239 --> 37:56.889
conference about him i was forced to do

37:51.309 --> 37:58.630
face many truths about myself I've only

37:56.889 --> 38:01.779
talked about his death a few times but

37:58.630 --> 38:03.910
each time i was real quick to point out

38:01.780 --> 38:06.700
that the reason i do my job is not just

38:03.909 --> 38:11.139
to save the victim but also to shield

38:06.699 --> 38:15.039
the victim's family from from the kind

38:11.139 --> 38:17.608
of grief that almost destroyed me

38:15.039 --> 38:22.690
sounds kind of

38:17.608 --> 38:26.348
noble doesn't

38:22.690 --> 38:29.318
yeah it's a lie

38:26.349 --> 38:33.550
uh-huh the truth is is that it's my

38:29.318 --> 38:37.329
guilt that drives me my shame and at

38:33.550 --> 38:39.369
times this unbearable sense of self

38:37.329 --> 38:40.210
loathing Sean wait a minute you're being

38:39.369 --> 38:43.930
way too harsh

38:40.210 --> 38:45.130
no no I'm not in the u.s. drowning is

38:43.929 --> 38:48.129
the second leading cause of injury

38:45.130 --> 38:52.150
and/or death to infants and children

38:48.130 --> 38:54.670
under 15 and as with james patrick

38:52.150 --> 38:57.338
almost all of them are preventable a

38:54.670 --> 38:58.780
child I get it can learn to swim before

38:57.338 --> 39:04.119
he walks

38:58.780 --> 39:04.960
Jason I knew my son should have swim

39:04.119 --> 39:06.369
lessons

39:04.960 --> 39:08.440
I'm a lifeguard I knew we should be

39:06.369 --> 39:12.460
water safe i put it off

39:08.440 --> 39:15.309
I'd say uh no he's he's too

39:12.460 --> 39:23.990
what's the rush what's the wash what's

39:15.309 --> 39:29.630
the rush

39:23.989 --> 39:32.389
gosh

39:29.630 --> 39:34.068
I thought there was time and if it could

39:32.389 --> 39:35.690
happen to me I'm a lifeguard it could

39:34.068 --> 39:43.818
happen to anyone

39:35.690 --> 39:45.559
Sean we would love to help but what

39:43.818 --> 39:48.619
could we do

39:45.559 --> 39:51.079
i'm not sure i just i want to start a

39:48.619 --> 39:55.130
dialogue so we can talk about some

39:51.079 --> 39:57.740
possible solutions i want making child

39:55.130 --> 39:59.298
water safety a priority at the center

39:57.739 --> 40:00.768
not to replace anything that we do but

39:59.298 --> 40:04.009
just in addition to it

40:00.768 --> 40:07.548
Sean let me play devil's advocate just

40:04.009 --> 40:11.809
for second say I'm a mother and I live

40:07.548 --> 40:15.710
in Iowa or Sydney or tokyo i have a

40:11.809 --> 40:17.960
child my friends have children how can

40:15.710 --> 40:20.720
they watch my training center help me

40:17.960 --> 40:23.659
are we gonna go door-to-door and teach

40:20.719 --> 40:25.219
kids how to swim but we could possibly

40:23.659 --> 40:26.868
set of the site on the internet I mean

40:25.219 --> 40:29.689
it would be kind of like going

40:26.869 --> 40:31.940
door-to-door we could raise awareness

40:29.690 --> 40:33.470
make it part of how we educate the

40:31.940 --> 40:36.289
lifeguard to come and train with us

40:33.469 --> 40:37.788
think about it's just a logical

40:36.289 --> 40:40.160
extension what we've already been doing

40:37.789 --> 40:43.720
it's just another way of making rescue

40:40.159 --> 40:48.429
on the same

40:43.719 --> 40:54.159
would you call it this management

40:48.429 --> 40:56.139
well i'm convinced and i'll tell you

40:54.159 --> 40:58.629
this if we could make a dent in those

40:56.139 --> 41:01.329
statistics would be one hell of a legacy

40:58.630 --> 41:04.300
for Baywatch why

41:01.329 --> 41:05.230
okay then that's what I'll tell the

41:04.300 --> 41:09.300
conference

41:05.230 --> 41:14.840
thank you

41:09.300 --> 41:14.840
thanks
