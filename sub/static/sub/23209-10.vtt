WEBVTT

00:00.947 --> 00:03.815
- Previously on The X-Files...
- It's all part of a conspiracy

00:03.840 --> 00:05.273
dating back to the UFO crash

00:05.308 --> 00:08.676
at Roswell in 1947.

00:08.711 --> 00:12.080
The aliens brought, not only technology.

00:12.115 --> 00:14.515
They brought the seeds
of our destruction.

00:14.551 --> 00:17.785
Civilization is in its final stages.

00:17.821 --> 00:19.120
I have seen it.

00:20.390 --> 00:21.789
- Scully?
- Aah.

00:21.825 --> 00:23.191
I know how it begins.

00:25.295 --> 00:26.761
Tell me what you saw.

00:26.796 --> 00:28.362
A plague will be released.

00:28.398 --> 00:31.766
And then it starts a pandemic.

00:31.801 --> 00:33.801
The Smoking Man is behind it.

00:35.572 --> 00:36.838
You can't stop what's already begun.

00:36.873 --> 00:38.106
You've always had your enemies.

00:38.141 --> 00:39.474
My enemies are legion.

00:39.509 --> 00:41.976
This is no ordinary contagion.

00:42.011 --> 00:43.878
This is an alien pathogen.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.813
He wants to exterminate humanity.

00:45.849 --> 00:46.848
What's your budding enterprise?

00:46.883 --> 00:48.649
The colonization of space.

00:50.587 --> 00:52.820
Transport all humanity off planet?

00:52.856 --> 00:55.323
- Only a chosen few.
- Kill him.

00:55.358 --> 00:56.891
You're his son.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.059
He won't be expecting you.

00:58.094 --> 00:59.560
Then why kill Mulder?

00:59.596 --> 01:01.195
Mulder would kill me.

01:01.231 --> 01:02.597
Scully will never take your offer.

01:03.766 --> 01:05.733
You have to stop the Smoking Man.

01:05.768 --> 01:09.904
He can't act without William.

01:09.939 --> 01:10.905
Who's the father?

01:10.940 --> 01:12.106
William is my son.

01:16.379 --> 01:18.246
Mulder, William is the key.

01:23.887 --> 01:26.521
My name is Jackson Van de Kamp.

01:29.526 --> 01:31.425
That's what my parents called me

01:31.461 --> 01:34.244
when they adopted me 17 years ago.

01:35.298 --> 01:38.866
My original name was William,
I've come to learn.

01:41.237 --> 01:43.037
That's what my birth mother called me.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.273
Dana Scully.

01:45.308 --> 01:47.375
I have never really met her properly,

01:47.410 --> 01:48.943
but I can feel her in these...

01:48.978 --> 01:51.078
Aah!

01:51.114 --> 01:53.614
Is this a message for me?

01:53.650 --> 01:55.550
...violent episodes
in which I can feel us

01:55.585 --> 01:57.552
connected to the future in ways

01:57.587 --> 01:59.954
that I'm just beginning to understand.

01:59.989 --> 02:03.257
Or am I sending a message to you?

02:03.293 --> 02:05.927
I don't know my role in the future,

02:05.962 --> 02:07.695
but I'm beginning
to understand that as well.

02:07.730 --> 02:10.097
I-I have visions of it.

02:10.133 --> 02:13.568
It's a world of confusion
and pain and loneliness

02:13.603 --> 02:16.237
that I can't escape, nor can I prevent,

02:16.272 --> 02:19.473
but I want no part in
the suffering that it brings.

02:21.277 --> 02:24.545
I've known happiness.

02:24.581 --> 02:27.481
I had a happy childhood.

02:27.517 --> 02:29.884
Until I grew older, I had
a life where I could dream

02:29.919 --> 02:31.552
of anything that I ever wanted to be,

02:31.588 --> 02:37.254
but even then I knew
that I had... powers.

02:38.214 --> 02:40.294
Special powers.

02:42.532 --> 02:45.299
When I turned 11, my powers grew.

02:47.770 --> 02:49.604
I got in a fight with Jerry Marriott.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.607
He was this bully who used
to pick on the smaller kids

02:52.642 --> 02:54.208
who couldn't defend themselves.

02:55.011 --> 02:57.411
Whoa.

02:57.447 --> 02:59.947
So I sent him to the hospital.

03:01.498 --> 03:03.474
I had to change schools many times.

03:03.509 --> 03:05.294
The kids...

03:06.222 --> 03:08.990
would catch on that I was different.

03:16.597 --> 03:21.469
And then I, uh, just kind of
became a criminal.

03:29.067 --> 03:31.646
So I was sent away
to a school for bad kids.

03:31.681 --> 03:33.347
It devastated my parents,

03:33.383 --> 03:35.116
but I just couldn't help myself.

03:35.151 --> 03:37.551
Yeah, I guess that's why
I've been lashing out.

03:37.587 --> 03:41.188
I talked to psychologists, and
I would just make up stories

03:41.224 --> 03:43.124
and tell them what they want to hear.

03:43.159 --> 03:45.960
I'm so scared that I'm gonna,
I'm gonna find out one day

03:45.995 --> 03:48.562
that I'm my father, all of a sudden.

03:48.598 --> 03:51.999
But then this man came from
the government to talk to me

03:52.035 --> 03:53.534
and I could tell something was up,

03:53.569 --> 03:56.170
so I decided to just cool it.

03:56.205 --> 04:00.007
Then I had to come home, but
every day there was this car

04:00.043 --> 04:04.378
on the street with these guys
in it, watching our house.

04:04.414 --> 04:05.913
And I was smart.

04:05.948 --> 04:07.815
I-I didn't make any mistakes

04:07.850 --> 04:11.786
until I decided to play a
stupid joke on these two girls.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.074

04:20.697 --> 04:23.564
My whole world came crashing down.

04:23.599 --> 04:27.335
My parents were killed
by those men on the street.

04:27.370 --> 04:28.502
Oh, no.

04:28.538 --> 04:29.837
And they're hunting me now.

04:29.872 --> 04:30.938
They found me.

04:30.973 --> 04:33.040
I'm afraid they'll kill me, too...

04:33.076 --> 04:35.209
if they catch me.

04:35.244 --> 04:37.845
- What I need most right now is answers.
- Jackson?

04:37.880 --> 04:40.047
About who I am, about
how I can get my life back.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.716
You seem like a nice person.

04:41.751 --> 04:44.085
I want to ask my real mother
these questions,

04:44.120 --> 04:46.754
but I know that the truth
can only come from my father,

04:46.789 --> 04:49.357
a man I've only seen in my visions...

04:49.392 --> 04:52.093
but who I know I already hate.

04:54.964 --> 04:59.300
But I need you to know, Fox,
when I gave you life,

04:59.335 --> 05:01.869
I never fathomed a moment

05:01.904 --> 05:03.404
when I would need to end it.

05:05.351 --> 05:07.174
I don't think you can do it.

06:09.012 --> 06:11.910
Hi. I'm an agent with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

06:11.911 --> 06:15.446
You have a guest here,
a young man in his late teens.

06:15.683 --> 06:17.983
Checked in this evening.
Paid me in hundreds.

06:18.823 --> 06:20.586
Is the boy a criminal?

06:20.621 --> 06:22.788
No. He's not.

06:22.823 --> 06:24.823
The boy is my son.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.010
Have you seen the Internet?

06:45.046 --> 06:47.404
Seen this load of B.S. Mulder's spewing?

06:47.429 --> 06:49.229
I haven't seen it. What is it?

06:49.265 --> 06:51.190
Well, he's gone off about a conspiracy

06:51.225 --> 06:53.233
on this Tad O'Malley show,

06:53.269 --> 06:56.337
about a conspiracy to wipe out humanity.

06:57.406 --> 06:59.113
"Death will hunt you down."

06:59.149 --> 07:00.581
That's a quote from Mulder.

07:00.617 --> 07:02.717
A quote from a federal agent,
Mr. Skinner.

07:02.752 --> 07:04.062
I can't speak for Agent Mulder.

07:04.098 --> 07:05.887
You're his superior, for God's sakes.

07:05.922 --> 07:07.221
You're supposed to be in charge.

07:07.257 --> 07:08.787
I am in charge.

07:10.660 --> 07:12.560
I'll see if I can find
Agent Scully and...

07:12.595 --> 07:15.563
You find her and you shut her down.

07:15.598 --> 07:17.465
I'm closing the X-Files.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.967
I want Mulder and Scully's badges.

07:20.003 --> 07:25.540
...a motel manager
reporting a military-style incursion.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.099
What if it's not just fake news?

07:27.135 --> 07:28.728
I don't care if it is true.

07:28.728 --> 07:30.061
That's someone else's problem.

07:30.096 --> 07:32.269
We're not gonna see panic in the streets.

07:39.573 --> 07:41.005
Skinner.

07:41.041 --> 07:43.508
I promised you
a global contagion, Mr. Skinner.

07:43.543 --> 07:45.710
I'm about to deliver on that promise.

07:45.745 --> 07:48.660
All I asked of you was to find the boy.

07:49.516 --> 07:51.516
So if I find him, will it stop?

07:54.020 --> 07:56.621
Just find me the boy, Mr. Skinner.

07:58.254 --> 08:01.059
Sir, I've left you three messages.

08:01.094 --> 08:02.827
Why aren't you answering?

08:02.862 --> 08:04.229
Because I've been getting my ass chewed.

08:04.264 --> 08:06.264
Well, it's Mulder.

08:06.299 --> 08:08.501
- He needs your help.
- Oh, he needs

08:08.536 --> 08:09.860
a hell of a lot more than that,
Agent Scully.

08:09.896 --> 08:11.536
Where is he?

08:12.684 --> 08:14.772
He's with our son.

08:14.808 --> 08:16.605
They're being pursued.

08:17.711 --> 08:19.844
He needs your help. I need your help.

08:19.879 --> 08:21.379
I've been told to shut you down.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.383
- What are you talking about?
- You're asking for my help

08:25.418 --> 08:27.051
when I've been asked to take your badges.

08:27.087 --> 08:28.200
Who said that? Kersh?

08:28.235 --> 08:29.454
- Is he in there?
- Dana...

08:29.489 --> 08:31.389
He doesn't understand
what's happening right now.

08:31.424 --> 08:33.791
Mulder has lit a fuse
that you can't put out.

08:33.827 --> 08:36.394
He's made outrageous public
statements on an Internet site.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.085
That wasn't him.

08:40.066 --> 08:41.504
That was me.

08:42.501 --> 08:44.269
And they're not outrageous.

08:49.335 --> 08:50.734
Where are they?

08:50.764 --> 08:53.411
I can't help you, Agent Scully,

08:53.446 --> 08:55.113
if I don't know what's going on.

08:59.486 --> 09:01.786
I'll put you on speaker phone.

09:01.821 --> 09:03.221
Who's on the phone?

09:03.256 --> 09:04.656
This is Monica Reyes.

09:04.691 --> 09:07.030
I think they've got your son, William.

09:08.094 --> 09:09.794
Just tell me where he is, Monica.

09:09.829 --> 09:12.430
Tennessee. Being transported
by a private jet.

09:12.465 --> 09:15.400
Tail number N-G-D-J-G,

09:15.435 --> 09:17.068
landing in Maryland in two hours.

09:17.103 --> 09:18.803
Which airport in Maryland?

09:18.838 --> 09:20.505
Braddock ATCA, southeast terminal.

09:20.540 --> 09:23.046
This may be your last good chance.

09:23.877 --> 09:26.778
When you say "last good chance,"
what exactly do you mean?

09:26.813 --> 09:28.346
The person who controls your son

09:28.381 --> 09:30.481
is the person who controls the future.

09:32.152 --> 09:33.818
He's not on that plane, Mulder.

09:33.853 --> 09:35.520
You have any reason to distrust her?

09:36.473 --> 09:37.789
Is there word on the boy?

09:37.824 --> 09:40.105
Nothing. Nothing to report.

09:41.161 --> 09:43.361
I don't know how I know, I just know

09:43.396 --> 09:44.696
that he's not on that plane.

09:44.731 --> 09:46.431
But what if he is on the plane?

09:46.466 --> 09:48.633
What-what if this is
our last good chance?

09:55.870 --> 09:57.975
Just come back alive.

10:28.639 --> 10:29.750
Come on.

10:29.785 --> 10:31.531
Come on.

10:33.376 --> 10:35.079
Damn it.

11:36.242 --> 11:37.275
Stop there!

11:38.320 --> 11:39.449
Face away.

11:40.413 --> 11:41.679
Hands behind your head.

11:43.228 --> 11:45.355
Behind your head!

12:05.500 --> 12:07.472
And here I thought you were a liar.

12:07.507 --> 12:09.173
Your secret space program.

12:09.209 --> 12:12.310
You should really do a better
job of protecting your ass.

12:12.345 --> 12:14.178
How the hell did you get in here?

12:14.214 --> 12:16.147
You can't keep this a secret for long.

12:16.182 --> 12:19.250
I'm unarmed, if you wouldn't mind.

12:19.285 --> 12:20.952
I'm only here about my boy.

12:20.987 --> 12:22.987
Well, we couldn't catch him.

12:23.022 --> 12:25.256
And I mean that quite literally,
Mr. Mulder.

12:25.291 --> 12:26.924
Why does everybody want my son?

12:26.960 --> 12:29.760
You still don't understand, do you?

12:29.796 --> 12:31.762
Your son has what everybody wants,

12:31.798 --> 12:33.965
what people would kill to have.

13:22.094 --> 13:23.761
Cut him off!

14:01.634 --> 14:03.901
Move! Move!

14:06.539 --> 14:07.971
Go, go, go!

14:21.854 --> 14:23.053
Hey, jumping over!

14:43.856 --> 14:45.809
Mulder, you haven't been
answering your phone.

14:46.450 --> 14:50.581
I had some payback to pay back.

14:50.850 --> 14:53.917
But you were right, Scully,
he wasn't on that plane.

14:53.953 --> 14:56.720
Look, I found something on the web.

14:56.756 --> 14:58.422
I think it's how they found him.

14:58.457 --> 15:01.558
There was a lotto cluster
in Northeastern Tennessee.

15:01.594 --> 15:03.909
Eight recent winners
in a ten-mile radius.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.929
Where was the last winner?

15:29.321 --> 15:33.590
Hi. You had a winning lottery
ticket sold here last week?

15:33.626 --> 15:35.025
Don't talk to me about that.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.427
I was about to take on the next register

15:36.462 --> 15:37.728
when the kid bought the ticket.

15:37.763 --> 15:38.962
So you saw the kid who bought it?

15:38.998 --> 15:41.265
He told Dierdre the winning numbers,

15:41.300 --> 15:42.733
like he's got inside information,

15:42.768 --> 15:44.902
hands her the ticket back and
says he'll split it with her.

15:44.937 --> 15:46.136
He did, too.

15:46.172 --> 15:47.938
So he came back. When was that?

15:47.973 --> 15:50.908
This morning. Dierdre took
the money and quit on the spot,

15:50.943 --> 15:52.609
which is why I'm cleaning
toilets right now.

15:52.645 --> 15:54.144
Right. You have,
you have security cameras?

15:54.180 --> 15:55.779
Oh, my God. You're not gonna take back

15:55.815 --> 15:57.114
all that money now, are you?

15:57.149 --> 15:58.315
I'm just looking for the boy.

16:09.261 --> 16:11.295
- William!
- You can't help me.

16:11.330 --> 16:12.729
The person who controls your son...

16:12.765 --> 16:13.931
Nobody can help me.

16:13.966 --> 16:15.299
I promise global contagion.

16:15.334 --> 16:16.733
...the person who controls the future.

16:16.769 --> 16:19.770
I need the boy.

16:26.879 --> 16:28.145
It was him, wasn't it?

16:29.181 --> 16:30.581
Yeah, I'm looking at him.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.115
He cashed in and hitched a ride
with a trucker.

16:32.151 --> 16:33.951
I'm about two hours behind him.

16:33.986 --> 16:35.719
I got a sense of the general
direction that he's headed.

16:51.704 --> 16:53.136
They're heading northeast.

16:53.172 --> 16:54.805
That's exactly what I'm thinking, Scully.

16:55.955 --> 16:57.043
We need to find

16:57.068 --> 16:58.809
him before they do.

16:58.844 --> 17:00.753
Everything depends on it.

17:01.514 --> 17:02.980
Every last thing in the world.

17:03.015 --> 17:04.348
Oh, I'm gonna find him.

17:04.383 --> 17:06.217
I am tired of looking at him on video.

17:37.950 --> 17:40.984
A young fellow like you needs
to be careful

17:41.020 --> 17:43.720
who to trust on the road.

17:43.756 --> 17:46.823
I can take care of myself okay.

17:46.859 --> 17:51.695
Been trucking for 40 years, seen it all.

17:51.730 --> 17:54.031
Driving can drive you mad.

18:03.442 --> 18:08.178
Filling the time thinking about trouble.

18:10.149 --> 18:12.783
What kind of trouble do you mean?

18:12.818 --> 18:16.053
What kind of trouble you looking for?

18:20.459 --> 18:22.092
- Hello?
- It's Dana Scully.

18:22.127 --> 18:24.962
Uh, I am just about to go on here, so...

18:24.997 --> 18:26.363
I want you to listen to me.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.065
- Can I call you right back?
- You're looking for

18:28.100 --> 18:30.267
a conspiracy, Mr. O'Malley? Here it is.

18:30.302 --> 18:32.474
You know why nobody's gonna mess with me?

18:32.499 --> 18:33.514
Hmm?

18:33.550 --> 18:35.013
'Cause I have superpowers.

18:35.048 --> 18:37.074
Right.

18:37.109 --> 18:40.844
Like one of them, uh, X-Men.

18:47.453 --> 18:49.086
There's going to be a contagion.

18:49.121 --> 18:51.254
A virus is going to be unleashed.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.790
People's immune systems
will be decimated.

18:53.826 --> 18:55.258
Did-did you say unleashed?

19:03.035 --> 19:04.635
Where are you getting this information?

19:04.670 --> 19:06.830
A man-made contagion...

19:06.865 --> 19:09.272
...from an alien pathogen.

19:12.277 --> 19:14.778
How the hell did you do that?

19:14.813 --> 19:16.146
Same way I do this.

19:28.127 --> 19:30.069
You realize how crazy this sounds?

19:30.104 --> 19:32.062
Death in the streets, Mr. O'Malley.

19:40.873 --> 19:42.623
Um, are you prepared to go on air?

19:44.584 --> 19:47.010
C-Can I say that you're my source?

19:48.004 --> 19:49.980
A federal agent is your source.

19:55.354 --> 19:56.753
Will Agent Mulder go on record?

19:58.824 --> 20:00.691
Agent Mulder's our only hope.

20:00.726 --> 20:02.025
Karen!

20:15.107 --> 20:17.074
You search for truth.

20:17.109 --> 20:18.642
I've seen the future.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.677
This is the truth that kills you.

20:20.713 --> 20:21.745
- William!
- William!

20:21.780 --> 20:22.779
Mulder.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.280
- Mulder?
- I lost him.

20:30.315 --> 20:31.414
He scared the truck driver.

20:31.450 --> 20:32.976
You don't want to know.

20:33.011 --> 20:34.684
- Mulder,
- He-he got out.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.627
I've seen it. You're in grave danger.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.685
No, I'm-I'm too close now.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.001
I'm... I-I think I know where he's going.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.804
- You're not listening to me.
- You're not listening to me.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.271
I've seen how it ends, Mulder.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.512
I think he probably hitched another ride.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.180
I-I'm not that far behind him.

21:13.097 --> 21:14.129
Mulder!

21:14.165 --> 21:15.597
I got to go.

21:30.614 --> 21:33.349
Hey. Thanks for stopping.

21:33.384 --> 21:36.308
No trouble at all. Long way from nowhere.

21:36.343 --> 21:37.574
Where you headed?

21:38.443 --> 21:40.055
Uh, Norfolk.

21:40.616 --> 21:43.192
I'm passing right by there. Get in.

22:06.817 --> 22:08.951
Yeah, I bet you went to see her first.

22:08.986 --> 22:10.919
Look, I just have to talk to you, Sarah.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.888
How come you didn't call her?

22:12.923 --> 22:14.790
Hi, Maddy.

22:14.825 --> 22:17.059
You're up past your bedtime.

22:17.094 --> 22:19.194
Look, I had to ditch my phone...

22:19.230 --> 22:20.629
Like we believe that.

22:20.664 --> 22:22.264
Look, I can explain everything.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.899
Please, it's cold, I...

22:23.934 --> 22:27.002
Hey, my parents
are coming home soon, so...

22:29.772 --> 22:31.807
You remember me, Brianna?

22:33.335 --> 22:35.778
Yeah. I think I know why you're here.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.713
Has he been here?

22:38.841 --> 22:40.215
Look, we broke up.

22:40.251 --> 22:42.117
- Has he called?
- We don't talk anymore.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.752
I need you to be honest with me.

22:43.788 --> 22:45.387
Who's at the door, Brianna?

22:46.443 --> 22:47.721
Um...

22:47.756 --> 22:49.224
I really have to go, sir.

22:49.260 --> 22:52.361
He's been here, hasn't he?

22:53.631 --> 22:55.798
He's in big trouble.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.100
I need to know where he is.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.303
Well, you're asking the wrong girl.

23:06.896 --> 23:08.343
I can't believe you, Sarah.

23:09.713 --> 23:11.580
I can't live like this.

23:11.615 --> 23:13.816
What are you talking about?

23:13.851 --> 23:15.484
If this is gonna be my life, I-I...

23:15.519 --> 23:17.119
I don't, I don't want to live.

23:17.154 --> 23:19.288
You can't talk like that, Jackson.

23:19.323 --> 23:20.789
What?

23:22.693 --> 23:25.093
Jacks... I haven't even heard
the name "Jackson" in months.

23:25.129 --> 23:27.863
You have no idea what I've been through.

23:27.898 --> 23:30.466
Maybe you, maybe you need to
go to the police.

23:30.501 --> 23:32.935
I can't go... the police
killed my parents.

23:32.970 --> 23:36.138
A-Are you sure they're the ones
who killed your parents?

23:36.173 --> 23:37.773
Yeah, 'cause I'm some kind of freak.

23:37.808 --> 23:38.874
Stop it.

23:38.909 --> 23:41.343
You are not...

23:41.378 --> 23:43.345
- a freak.
- Yes, I am.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.666
- No.
- Okay, yeah,

23:44.691 --> 23:46.381
you've seen what I can do, Sarah.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.376
And they want me for that, all right?

23:48.411 --> 23:50.178
They want to catch me,
they want to put me in a cage,

23:50.213 --> 23:51.612
they want to poke me and prod me

23:51.648 --> 23:53.714
and keep me in a laboratory
my entire life.

23:54.375 --> 23:56.384
What are you gonna do?

24:00.423 --> 24:02.049
I could die.

24:03.133 --> 24:04.659
I could jump off a bridge, or...

24:04.694 --> 24:07.562
What can I say to stop you?

24:07.597 --> 24:09.056
Say you'll come with me.

24:10.533 --> 24:11.833
I can't do this alone.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.801
Please, I'm so sick of being alone.

24:16.773 --> 24:18.372
That's my parents.

24:18.408 --> 24:20.007
Please, I-I can't...

24:20.043 --> 24:22.643
- I can't talk now.
- I-I have money.

24:22.679 --> 24:24.679
I have a... look, I have...
look, I have so much money.

24:24.714 --> 24:26.080
- Okay.
- We can go anywhere.

24:27.383 --> 24:28.649
I can meet you somewhere.

24:28.685 --> 24:29.750
Mm-hmm?

24:29.786 --> 24:31.586
Meet me at that-that motel.

24:31.621 --> 24:33.087
The Timberland?

24:33.706 --> 24:35.374
I will.

24:36.025 --> 24:37.325
Just go.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.526
Okay? Out the back.

24:38.561 --> 24:39.894
- You promise?
- I promise.

24:39.929 --> 24:42.230
Now... okay, don't do anything stupid

24:42.265 --> 24:43.865
before I get there, okay?

24:43.900 --> 24:45.833
Okay?

24:53.610 --> 24:55.728
Sarah, I need to know where he is.

24:57.021 --> 24:59.113
I-I don't, I don't know what you mean.

24:59.148 --> 25:01.115
He's on the run. I can help him.

25:01.859 --> 25:03.751
Why should I believe
you're telling the truth

25:03.786 --> 25:05.613
if he doesn't even believe it?

25:07.557 --> 25:08.923
Because I'm his father.

25:08.958 --> 25:10.242
That's why.

25:13.263 --> 25:15.129
I don't believe you're his father.

25:52.101 --> 25:55.120
U-Uh, I'm trying to sleep.
What do you want?

25:56.205 --> 25:58.248
My name is Mulder.

25:58.975 --> 26:00.876
I'm your father.

26:25.802 --> 26:28.002
I know it must seem strange to you,

26:28.037 --> 26:31.439
but I've been looking for you forever.

26:31.474 --> 26:33.007
Okay, so how'd you find me now?

26:33.042 --> 26:34.842
It doesn't matter.

26:34.877 --> 26:36.412
I'm here.

26:38.414 --> 26:39.814
Ah.

26:39.849 --> 26:42.283
You're taller than me.

26:42.318 --> 26:44.285
I held you when you were a baby.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.672
Okay, maybe you did,
but I don't remember that.

26:47.657 --> 26:49.490
You're angry.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.392
And I understand.

26:52.862 --> 26:54.295
I don't think you do understand.

26:54.330 --> 26:56.130
- There's a lot I have to explain.
- Look, it's not

26:56.165 --> 26:57.732
safe for you here, okay? You should go.

26:57.767 --> 26:59.734
If you trust me, I'll protect you.

27:32.574 --> 27:34.207
I know you know who I am.

27:34.242 --> 27:36.834
You hid from me. And from your mother.

27:37.677 --> 27:39.563
Yeah, 'cause I'm a danger to people.

27:39.588 --> 27:40.787
Well, I can help with that.

27:40.823 --> 27:42.022
You can't help me.

27:42.057 --> 27:43.857
All right? Nobody can help me.

27:43.892 --> 27:46.159
Okay? These people, they're
never gonna stop coming for me.

27:50.611 --> 27:52.997
I've seen the future, all right?

27:53.032 --> 27:54.968
I have visions.

27:55.004 --> 27:56.970
I-I know what happens if they catch me.

27:57.006 --> 27:58.705
All the people who are gonna die.

27:58.741 --> 28:01.441
Your mother has those same visions.

28:04.346 --> 28:06.246
Then why don't you see them?

28:08.751 --> 28:10.917
Look, I don't want to live in that world.

28:10.953 --> 28:12.819
And, I don't know, maybe I can stop it.

28:12.855 --> 28:15.389
- If I didn't exist...
- It's not your fault, William.

28:15.424 --> 28:17.491
- Yes, it is.
- Then let me help you stop it.

28:17.526 --> 28:20.827
You can't. All right?
'Cause you die, too.

28:22.264 --> 28:23.860
We still want the boy alive.

28:25.301 --> 28:26.900
No one has to die here, William.

28:26.935 --> 28:29.836
Especially not you. You have to live.

28:29.872 --> 28:31.738
Look, I know that you think that
you're helping me right now,

28:31.774 --> 28:33.740
but you're not helping me, okay?
You're just helping them.

28:33.776 --> 28:35.809
You're just helping them find me.

28:35.844 --> 28:37.744
And...

28:39.114 --> 28:41.281
Okay, it's too late.
Listen, you got to go.

28:41.317 --> 28:42.683
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- You got to...

28:42.718 --> 28:44.284
- You get back there, and you get down.
- Get out the back.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.019
- Get down.
- No... stay away from the door!

28:47.523 --> 28:48.989
- Move!
- Get down.

28:50.159 --> 28:51.558
Let me see your hands.

29:14.850 --> 29:16.850
William!

29:22.091 --> 29:23.787
William!

29:28.831 --> 29:30.831
The hell's going on here?

29:42.344 --> 29:43.877
I can't help you, Agent Scully,

29:43.912 --> 29:45.846
if I don't know what's going on.

29:50.386 --> 29:51.818
Mulder?

29:51.854 --> 29:53.653
You can't believe what just happened.

29:53.689 --> 29:55.856
- Pat, are you seeing this?
- I lost him, Scully.

29:55.891 --> 29:56.990
He's gone.

29:57.025 --> 29:58.091
Just tell me where you are.

29:58.127 --> 29:59.526
I'm still in Norfolk.

29:59.561 --> 30:01.895
Mulder, I'm coming down there.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.952
He won't listen to reason.

30:05.454 --> 30:07.534
He'll listen to me.

30:09.705 --> 30:11.204
I know he will.

30:13.542 --> 30:15.876
I got to go.

30:15.911 --> 30:17.911
I'm supposed to rein you in.

30:20.215 --> 30:22.482
This isn't about the FBI, sir.

30:25.377 --> 30:27.788
This is about our son.

30:27.823 --> 30:30.357
I'll drive.

30:30.392 --> 30:32.361
We have been working

30:32.396 --> 30:34.561
around the clock here
to bring you breaking news

30:34.596 --> 30:39.266
of a global contagion,
Death Will Hunt You Down.

30:39.301 --> 30:41.468
That's its name, says our FBI source,

30:41.503 --> 30:45.439
as his superiors
label it fake news. Shocker.

30:45.474 --> 30:47.774
Now, follow me here, folks.
We have eyewitnesses

30:47.810 --> 30:49.976
at a motel in Norfolk, Virginia,

30:50.012 --> 30:52.779
and a motel manager reporting

30:52.815 --> 30:55.081
a military-style incursion.

30:55.117 --> 30:57.284
Federal agent. I want to talk to you.

30:57.319 --> 31:00.387
Four individuals in
a military vehicle assaulting

31:00.422 --> 31:03.723
a motel room occupied by a teenager.

31:03.759 --> 31:06.326
Now, that is our FBI source on camera

31:06.361 --> 31:09.563
after he witnessed the execution

31:09.598 --> 31:13.600
of military personnel
in a bloodbath so insane,

31:13.635 --> 31:16.736
it can only point to
a conspiracy the likes of which

31:16.772 --> 31:18.505
the world has never seen.

31:22.845 --> 31:24.744
Just let me talk to Sarah.

31:24.780 --> 31:26.146
I said she can't talk now.

31:26.181 --> 31:27.914
He's not answering.

31:29.718 --> 31:31.184
Well, apparently, he's making news again.

31:31.220 --> 31:32.986
Kersh is blowing up my phone.

31:33.021 --> 31:35.489
Why are you violating
his direct orders, sir?

31:35.524 --> 31:37.858
Right now, we need to find your son.

31:38.576 --> 31:41.161
But why would you risk your whole career?

31:41.591 --> 31:43.463
I think I've been
pretty clear about that.

31:44.136 --> 31:47.033
Who were you on the phone with
outside of Kersh's office?

31:47.069 --> 31:48.535
Who was that?

31:50.405 --> 31:53.173
There's something you need to know.

31:54.977 --> 31:57.310
Something you may not want to hear.

31:57.346 --> 31:58.879
It's about your son.

31:58.914 --> 32:00.347
And who his father is.

32:00.382 --> 32:01.663
I need to know where William would go.

32:01.699 --> 32:04.017
Where-where he might go to feel safe.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.319
I'd probably say the harbor.

32:06.355 --> 32:07.954
Okay, where-where at the harbor?

32:07.990 --> 32:09.723
We'd all go down by the docks.

32:09.758 --> 32:13.026
Do you have a-an address
for a street, or a landmark?

32:13.061 --> 32:15.195
I-I don't know. Uh...

32:15.230 --> 32:17.163
Probably the old sugar factory.

32:19.434 --> 32:22.502
Hearing this about William
must come as a shock.

32:23.133 --> 32:25.305
I didn't want to tell you.

32:25.340 --> 32:26.928
I wanted you...

32:32.347 --> 32:33.747
That was Mulder.

32:33.782 --> 32:35.437
All right, hold on.

33:07.616 --> 33:08.782
Mulder?

33:19.328 --> 33:21.227
Don't run.

33:21.263 --> 33:22.896
William!

33:37.012 --> 33:39.479
William!

33:43.285 --> 33:44.651
It's me.

33:45.549 --> 33:47.153
I just saw him.

34:00.627 --> 34:01.960
No!

34:01.995 --> 34:03.361
Go!

34:10.530 --> 34:12.194
- That's Skinner.
- Wait.

34:25.485 --> 34:27.518
- He's here.
- I know. I just saw him.

34:27.554 --> 34:28.987
Yeah, he doesn't want to be found.

34:29.022 --> 34:32.157
- I just want to talk to him, Mulder.
- I talked to him.

34:32.192 --> 34:33.824
He told me everything...
what he's afraid of.

34:33.860 --> 34:37.562
- I know what he's afraid of.
- Stop. It's no use.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.630
What do you mean?

34:39.666 --> 34:41.498
I'm asking you to let him go.

34:41.534 --> 34:42.630
What are you talking about, Mulder?

34:42.665 --> 34:45.469
- There's nothing we can do.
- We can protect him.

34:45.505 --> 34:47.672
No, we can't protect him. No one can.

34:50.197 --> 34:52.239
He knows that you love him.

34:54.326 --> 34:59.039
How can he know that?
How can he possibly know that?

35:02.066 --> 35:03.732
Scully!

35:05.359 --> 35:07.092
Stop him!

35:10.797 --> 35:12.761
William.

35:15.535 --> 35:17.402
- William!
- William!

35:20.407 --> 35:21.573
William!

35:28.115 --> 35:29.247
William!

35:40.727 --> 35:42.427
William!

36:17.864 --> 36:21.032
- He's in the next building.
- Go!

37:13.386 --> 37:16.287
You really don't give up, do you?

37:16.323 --> 37:18.289
But then you have so much to lose.

37:18.325 --> 37:19.657
It's what we have in common.

37:20.680 --> 37:23.127
We have nothing in common.

37:23.163 --> 37:24.851
I need the boy.

37:25.532 --> 37:27.332
The boy is mine.

37:28.563 --> 37:31.135
The boy would rather die first,

37:31.171 --> 37:33.171
now that he knows the truth.

37:35.542 --> 37:37.509
That I'm the one who made him?

37:37.544 --> 37:39.783
That I'm William's creator?

37:50.123 --> 37:53.658
You'd shoot your own firstborn son?

37:53.693 --> 37:56.060
Shot my second-born son once.

38:00.901 --> 38:03.098
But I need you to know, Fox,

38:03.870 --> 38:05.670
when I gave you life,

38:05.705 --> 38:08.172
I never fathomed the moment would come

38:08.208 --> 38:10.188
when I would need to end it.

38:12.328 --> 38:14.445
I don't think you can do it.

38:14.481 --> 38:16.147
Then you don't know me very well.

38:39.806 --> 38:41.606
Hey!

39:29.489 --> 39:31.289
He's gone.

39:33.226 --> 39:35.059
He's gone, Scully.

39:38.965 --> 39:40.565
He shot him.

39:50.677 --> 39:52.710
And he shot me.

40:08.228 --> 40:09.594
Mulder...

40:12.712 --> 40:14.103
He...

40:15.702 --> 40:18.503
He wanted us to let him go.

40:19.192 --> 40:21.005
He wasn't meant to be.

40:21.041 --> 40:22.373
William was our son.

40:22.409 --> 40:23.780
No.

40:23.805 --> 40:26.678
Scully, he was our son!

40:26.713 --> 40:28.179
No.

40:33.286 --> 40:35.486
William was an experiment, Mulder.

40:35.522 --> 40:38.523
- What are you talking about?
- Mulder...

40:39.671 --> 40:41.993
He was an idea.

40:42.028 --> 40:44.829
Born in a laboratory.

40:44.864 --> 40:46.531
But you were his mother.

40:46.566 --> 40:48.137
No, I...

40:49.369 --> 40:50.932
I carried him.

40:51.805 --> 40:53.226
And I bore him.

40:55.075 --> 40:57.188
But I was never a mother to him.

40:57.896 --> 40:59.858
I wasn't.

41:01.614 --> 41:06.906
William... William was...

41:29.275 --> 41:31.242
For so long,

41:31.277 --> 41:32.891
I believed.

41:34.981 --> 41:37.520
What am I now if I'm not a father?

41:44.657 --> 41:46.257
You are a father.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.327
What are you talking about?

41:58.838 --> 42:01.906
- That's impossible.
- I know.

42:03.796 --> 42:05.710
I know it is.

42:08.347 --> 42:10.414
It's more than impossible.
