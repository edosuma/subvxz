02:26.640 --> 02:30.080
<b>Wow, all of them were split cleanly in half.</b>

02:30.080 --> 02:31.580
<b>Impressive.</b>

02:33.070 --> 02:38.090
<b>This one almost looks like he was smashed

05:03.120 --> 05:04.760

05:16.630 --> 05:17.290
<b>Eh?</b>

05:17.870 --> 05:20.460
<b>You ordered Flutter to chase the prey,</b>

05:20.460 --> 05:23.240
<b>while you hid in the grass to ambush them.</b>

05:23.240 --> 05:24.870
<b>That's pretty lame.</b>

05:24.870 --> 05:25.630
<b>Huh?</b>

05:26.370 --> 05:28.780
<b>Aren't you the king of the jungle?</b>

05:28.780 --> 05:33.340
<b>A king should face his prey, rather than hiding.</b>

05:33.340 --> 05:37.730
<b>Just jump out and go,

05:38.060 --> 05:40.750
<b>That's so much cooler.</b>

06:01.380 --> 06:02.590
<b>What's that?</b>

06:03.170 --> 06:05.460
<b>I'll explain the details later.</b>

06:05.460 --> 06:07.470
<b>Its number is 4-933.</b>

06:08.010 --> 06:10.990
<b>It was captured and brought

06:10.990 --> 06:13.370
<b>Number 4-933...</b>

06:13.370 --> 06:15.560
<b>Doesn't mean a thing to me.</b>

06:15.560 --> 06:17.850
<b>It was probably given to the Queen.</b>

06:18.330 --> 06:22.860
<b>Her appetite is even more insatiable these days.</b>

06:23.360 --> 06:26.530

06:26.530 --> 06:27.730
<b>Don't see 'em.</b>

06:27.730 --> 06:30.390
<b>It must already be inside the Queen's belly.</b>

<b>Are you certain?</b>

06:31.870 --> 06:33.830
<b>It isn't here...</b>

06:33.830 --> 06:36.560
<b>Where else would it be?</b>

06:36.560 --> 06:38.500
<b>Could it have escaped?</b>

06:39.290 --> 06:42.060
<b>Any creature poisoned by our nerve toxin</b>

06:42.060 --> 06:44.180
<b>will be paralyzed for at least a month.</b>

06:44.500 --> 06:47.380
<b>After a mere three days, it couldn't move around.</b>

06:47.670 --> 06:50.730
<b>You can't be sure when it

06:50.730 --> 06:53.190
<b>They aren't like normal humans.</b>

06:53.830 --> 06:57.390
<b>You should know that very well.</b>

07:03.070 --> 07:05.490
<b>The next time I see them,</b>

07:05.490 --> 07:10.850

<b><i>The antidote I hid in my

07:18.800 --> 07:21.920
<b><i>But I could barely drag myself across the ground.</i></b>

07:21.920 --> 07:24.810
<b><i>For the time being, I'll have to hide here...</i></b>

07:26.260 --> 07:29.400
<b><i>But what's going on?</i></b>

07:29.400 --> 07:31.300
<b><i>How can a Chimera Ant use</i> Nen?</b>

07:33.680 --> 07:36.040

07:36.040 --> 07:38.180
<b>Come on, give me a break...</b>

07:38.180 --> 07:40.430
<b>I'm busy enough as it is.</b>

07:40.750 --> 07:45.310
<b>Didn't you hear me say the Queen 
has a huge appetite now?</b>

07:45.790 --> 07:48.620
<b>I am well aware of that.</b>

07:48.620 --> 07:51.290
<b>I don't know anything about this "rare" stuff,</b>

07:51.290 --> 07:53.900
<b>but why are you so obsessed with this human?</b>

07:53.900 --> 07:55.740
<b>I'd like to ask it a few questions.</b>

07:56.870 --> 08:01.340
<b>Can't you see the light surrounding his body?</b>

08:02.310 --> 08:03.510
<b>Light?</b>

08:04.820 --> 08:06.460
<b>No, I don't see a thing.</b>

08:06.860 --> 08:07.840
<b>I see.</b>

08:07.840 --> 08:11.880
<b>Then it's true that only some 
can identify this power.</b>

08:11.880 --> 08:13.720
<b>Meaning it's a talent.</b>

08:16.550 --> 08:18.030
<b><i>Exactly.</i></b>

08:18.030 --> 08:21.780
<b><i>This talent is my destiny, bestowed

08:21.780 --> 08:24.230
<b><i>The power of a chosen few...</i></b>

08:24.880 --> 08:30.480
<b><i>If I master this power, I can become the king!</i></b>

08:31.060 --> 08:32.610
<b><i>I will be king!</i></b>

08:56.770 --> 08:58.980
<b>Retreat! Retreat!</b>

08:58.980 --> 09:01.190
<b>Hmm? What's wrong, Flutter?</b>

09:12.800 --> 09:15.210
<b>Wh-What's that?</b>

10:02.990 --> 10:04.090
<b>Huh?</b>

10:04.090 --> 10:05.330
<b>What about the feast?</b>

10:25.070 --> 10:27.960
<b>He was able to understand

10:27.960 --> 10:30.180
<b>and he calmly backed down at once.</b>

10:31.630 --> 10:34.140
<b>Most likely, he was a Squadron Leader.</b>

10:39.830 --> 10:42.290
<b><i>I always believed that the world</i></b>

10:44.780 --> 10:48.100
<b><i>revolved around my claws and fangs.</i></b>

10:48.770 --> 10:51.390
<b><i>That if I brandished them,</i></b>

10:51.390 --> 10:54.850
<b><i>I could take the life of any other creature,</i></b>

10:55.600 --> 10:58.620
<b><i>could always satisfy my own hunger...</i></b>

10:59.250 --> 11:01.940
<b><i>And that I was truly blessed.</i></b>

11:04.700 --> 11:07.520
<b><i>However, that wasn't the case.</i></b>

11:08.210 --> 11:12.650
<b><i>Others were stronger,

11:13.360 --> 11:16.210
<b><i>Death taught me that lesson.</i></b>

11:16.210 --> 11:18.490
<b><i>But I am stronger now.</i></b>

11:32.790 --> 11:36.320
<b>At the moment, we may not be

11:38.890 --> 11:43.350
<b>But now we are armed with the ability to learn.</b>

11:50.370 --> 11:51.920
<b>We're following them.</b>

11:52.780 --> 11:54.940
<b>Their nest must be nearby.</b>

11:56.140 --> 11:57.780
<b>If we follow them,</b>

<b>we will find the Queen.</b>

<b>What is that?</b>

12:20.230 --> 12:22.670
<b>Something is coming!</b>

12:37.950 --> 12:40.530
<b>That was a fascinating conversation...</b>

12:41.270 --> 12:43.560
<b>You mentioned something about talent.</b>

12:46.200 --> 12:49.460
<b>Allow me to take part.</b>

12:55.280 --> 12:59.010
<b>O-One of the Queen's Royal Guards!</b>

16:04.240 --> 16:07.020

16:12.260 --> 16:17.060
<b>"New memories are stored

<b><i>Hatsu</i> is a technique for

<b>Every <i>Nen</i> user belongs to one of these.</b>

17:30.820 --> 17:32.990
<b>You want to increase the amount of your aura,</b>

<b>as well as the speed of its flow.</b>

17:39.800 --> 17:45.570

<b>In addition to the basic <i>Nen</i>

<b>the <i>Nen</i> user's individuality.</b>

<b>Water divination?</b>

19:20.120 --> 19:22.380
<b>Give it a try, Rammot.</b>

19:22.780 --> 19:23.760
<b>Right.</b>

19:37.720 --> 19:40.590
<b>Since the water's overflowing,</b>

19:40.590 --> 19:42.000
<b>that makes you an Enhancer.</b>

19:42.000 --> 19:43.480
<b>An Enhancer?</b>

19:43.480 --> 19:48.620
<b>Which confirms that Rammot is a <i>Nen</i> user?</b>

19:49.050 --> 19:49.940
<b>Seems so.</b>

19:52.030 --> 19:53.000
<b>Oh, yeah...</b>

19:53.840 --> 19:57.400
<b>Didn't you say you fought a rare human?</b>

19:57.400 --> 19:58.500
<b>Y-Yes.</b>

19:59.080 --> 20:02.630
<b>The impact from its attack opened your pores...</b>

20:03.200 --> 20:05.390
<b>And released your aura.</b>

20:05.390 --> 20:06.260
<b>Pores?</b>

20:07.870 --> 20:11.270
<b>Apparently, they're small holes all over your body.</b>

20:15.720 --> 20:17.270
<b>I see...</b>

20:17.270 --> 20:20.700
<b>Colt also thought that Rammot's change</b>

<b>was triggered by his fight

20:24.990 --> 20:27.320
<b>It seems he was correct.</b>

20:28.490 --> 20:31.640
<b>So if Rammot is a <i>Nen</i> user now,</b>

<b>can we use him to open everyone's pores?</b>

20:35.260 --> 20:37.190
<b>Sure, sounds good.</b>

<b>I think I'll give this a try.</b>

20:53.580 --> 20:55.310
<b>The leaf wilted...</b>

20:56.260 --> 20:57.700
<b><i>Unbelievable.</i></b>

20:57.700 --> 21:00.290
<b><i>One of us was born possessing </i>Nen <i>ability</i>,</b>

21:01.420 --> 21:03.820
<b><i>without having to fight a rare human!</i></b>

<b>Then, Commander, that makes you a Specialist,</b>

21:09.100 --> 21:12.200
<b>not belonging to another category?</b>

21:13.300 --> 21:14.830
<b>Neferpitou.</b>

21:15.360 --> 21:16.380
<b>Huh?</b>

21:16.380 --> 21:19.340
<b>That is the name the Queen gave me.</b>

21:20.150 --> 21:23.590
<b>From now on, call me Neferpitou.</b>

21:24.000 --> 21:24.900
<b>Right!</b>

21:25.350 --> 21:26.770
<b>I don't need him anymore.</b>

21:27.220 --> 21:29.010
<b>Feed him to the Queen now.</b>

21:29.010 --> 21:29.940
<b>Right!</b>

21:44.360 --> 21:49.120
<b>From birth, Neferpitou already 
possessed incredible power.</b>

21:50.200 --> 21:55.020

<b>Wake up!</b>

23:29.760 --> 23:30.590
<b>C'mon, it's morning.</b>

23:30.590 --> 23:32.130
<b>It's 10:50.</b>

<b>I'll kill-you-a!</b>
