WEBVTT

00:05.472 --> 00:07.807
<i>- That's a -- </i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah..</i>

00:07.874 --> 00:10.710
That's kind of a hard pass
for me as much as --

00:10.810 --> 00:13.346
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- Troy didn't even entertain it.</i>

00:13.413 --> 00:14.481
<i>He just said no.</i>

00:14.547 --> 00:16.649
<i>Troy just hard passed.</i>

00:16.716 --> 00:17.650
<i>Hard pass.</i>

00:17.717 --> 00:19.686
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

00:19.753 --> 00:22.389
<i>We shouldn't have</i>
<i>done anything. Oh!</i>

00:22.489 --> 00:23.523
<i>I know.</i>

00:28.728 --> 00:30.497
<i>She just said</i>
<i>she wasn't going to.</i>

00:30.563 --> 00:32.031
<i>I hate this.</i>

00:32.098 --> 00:34.834
<i>Obviously, I would love</i>
<i>to end up in that romance room.</i>

00:34.901 --> 00:37.103
<i>That's what I'm here for,</i>
<i>but Troy is on a date,</i>

00:37.203 --> 00:39.439
<i>so it's a little conflicting.</i>

00:39.539 --> 00:41.174
<i>And I was not gonna have that.</i>

00:41.241 --> 00:42.675
<i>Go back over there.</i>

00:42.742 --> 00:46.446
Alright, well, I'm gonna go back
here and try not to be rude.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.448
<i>Made my mom</i>
<i>look like a fool.</i>

00:48.548 --> 00:50.450
<i>I will talk to you --</i>
<i>I don't know when.</i>

00:50.550 --> 00:52.285
<i>- Tomorrow.</i>
<i>- Maybe. Breakfast.</i>

00:52.385 --> 00:54.254
<i>- Yes. Okay.</i>
<i>- Okay. Alright.</i>

00:54.354 --> 00:55.889
<i>It was none</i>
<i>of their faults.</i>

00:55.955 --> 00:57.624
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- We did it.</i>

00:57.724 --> 00:59.059
<i>I don't feel good at all</i>
<i>right now.</i>

00:59.125 --> 01:00.260
<i>Neither do I.</i>

01:00.360 --> 01:02.862
<i>Not a great first day</i>
<i>for me or my mom.</i>

01:02.929 --> 01:05.131
<i>Watching it, I think it hurt me</i>
<i>more than it hurt her.</i>

01:05.231 --> 01:06.599
<i>I just want to guide her</i>
<i>in the wrong direction.</i>

01:06.699 --> 01:07.934
<i>I want my mom</i>
<i>to have a connection</i>

01:08.034 --> 01:09.135
<i>and a relationship after this.</i>

01:09.235 --> 01:11.037
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to see her get hurt.</i>

01:15.208 --> 01:16.543
<i>Mm.</i>

01:16.609 --> 01:19.379
<i>And so to top it all off,</i>
<i>after that shitty night,</i>

01:19.446 --> 01:21.714
<i>I had to go</i>
<i>and clean the bathrooms.</i>

01:21.781 --> 01:24.451
<i>But it's important</i>
<i>for my mom to be here.</i>

01:24.551 --> 01:25.919
<i>I absolutely want her</i>
<i>to find love.</i>

01:25.985 --> 01:27.620
<i>That's the whole reason</i>
<i>why we're here.</i>

01:27.720 --> 01:29.255
<i>That little sacrifice I make</i>

01:29.322 --> 01:32.392
<i>gets her a step closer towards</i>
<i>making a deeper connection,</i>

01:32.459 --> 01:33.760
<i>then, yeah,</i>
<i>I'll scrub some floors.</i>

01:33.827 --> 01:34.994
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

01:35.095 --> 01:36.996
<i>How's it going?</i>

01:37.097 --> 01:39.466
<i>It's going great.</i>

01:39.566 --> 01:41.101
<i>Good job.</i>
<i>Keep up the good work.</i>

01:41.167 --> 01:42.235
<i>Thank you so much</i>
<i>for the support.</i>

01:42.302 --> 01:43.303
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

01:43.403 --> 01:45.138
<i>Oh, Brennen,</i>
<i>you're cleaning.</i>

01:45.238 --> 01:46.806
Thank you for coming in
with the sympathies.

01:46.906 --> 01:49.809
<i>I'm here to commiserate.</i>
<i>I have to brush my teeth.</i>

01:49.909 --> 01:51.277
<i>Please. I mean,</i>
<i>feel free to make a mess.</i>

01:54.080 --> 01:56.015
<i>I got the water</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

01:56.116 --> 01:59.319
<i>All I have to say</i>
<i>is my mom owes me so much.</i>

01:59.419 --> 02:01.955
<i>- Oh, great work.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

02:15.468 --> 02:18.705
<i>- Hey, guys.</i>
<i>- Hi. What up, Bre?</i>

02:18.805 --> 02:19.939
<i>What you guys</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

02:20.006 --> 02:21.941
<i>We are talking about</i>
<i>last night.</i>

02:22.008 --> 02:23.443
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- And how that -- how it went.</i>

02:23.510 --> 02:27.714
No parents in this situation
should ever go through

02:27.814 --> 02:29.516
<i>what our parents went through</i>
<i>just last night.</i>

02:29.616 --> 02:31.551
<i>Yeah, I feel really bad</i>
<i>for your mom.</i>

02:31.651 --> 02:33.720
<i>That was her experience</i>
<i>for her first day.</i>

02:33.820 --> 02:35.455
<i>How are you feeling</i>
<i>about that?</i>

02:35.522 --> 02:38.291
<i>I didn't sleep well last night</i>
<i>because of it.</i>

02:38.358 --> 02:40.960
It's weird to be in
charge of this aspect
of your parents' lives.

02:41.027 --> 02:43.663
<i>Especially if you're here</i>
<i>for good reasons.</i>

02:43.730 --> 02:46.132
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:46.199 --> 02:49.469
<i>All of them.</i>
<i>It wasn't just my mom, you know.</i>

02:49.536 --> 02:52.539
<i>But your mom was put</i>
<i>in a very uncomfortable spot.</i>

02:52.639 --> 02:53.706
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:53.806 --> 02:56.209
<i>So...I don't know.</i>

02:56.309 --> 02:58.211
<i>It's not nice seeing that.</i>

02:58.311 --> 03:01.581
<i>We were super hasty</i>
<i>and didn't really...</i>

03:01.681 --> 03:03.516
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:03.583 --> 03:04.884
<i>We definitely</i>
<i>need to take our time</i>

03:04.984 --> 03:07.153
<i>next time we have</i>
<i>an opportunity to meddle.</i>

03:07.220 --> 03:08.755
<i>I think the opportunity</i>
<i>to meddle,</i>

03:08.855 --> 03:12.559
<i>it's something that I need</i>
<i>to absolutely take seriously</i>

03:12.659 --> 03:14.928
<i>and put some serious</i>
<i>thought into.</i>

03:15.028 --> 03:17.096
<i>I'm here because I want my mom</i>
<i>to have a connection</i>

03:17.197 --> 03:18.598
<i>and a relationship after this.</i>

03:18.698 --> 03:20.700
The goal is for every parent
to be happy at the end.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.268
<i>They'll all just get married,</i>

03:22.368 --> 03:23.937
<i>and we'll just all be, like,</i>
<i>stepbrothers and -sisters.</i>

03:24.037 --> 03:26.039
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>We'll be a weird...</i>

03:26.105 --> 03:29.842
<i>A weird-ass -- weird family.</i>

03:31.878 --> 03:34.447
<i>Deneia:</i>
<i>Hi. It's me again.</i>

03:34.547 --> 03:35.949
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Please come join me.</i>

03:36.049 --> 03:38.218
<i>How do you pronounce this bread?</i>
<i>Is it "challa"?</i>

03:38.284 --> 03:39.519
<i>- "Hala."</i>
<i>- "Hala."</i>

03:39.586 --> 03:41.554
<i>Scott: I actually got up early</i>
<i>this morning</i>

03:41.621 --> 03:44.457
<i>because I'm gonna make</i>
<i>some breakfast for Deneia.</i>

03:44.557 --> 03:47.126
<i>I'm hoping I can get</i>
<i>some alone time with her.</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:48.795
I happened to notice
you like French toast.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.196
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"You know what?</i>

03:50.263 --> 03:53.700
<i>Challah French toast</i>
<i>is the best."</i>

03:53.766 --> 03:57.303
<i>Deneia: Well, I'm making</i>
<i>a connection with Scott.</i>

03:57.403 --> 04:01.441
<i>He's making the process</i>
<i>a lot easier for me.</i>

04:01.541 --> 04:03.610
<i>I need your help.</i>

04:03.710 --> 04:05.411
<i>Can you, um --</i>

04:05.478 --> 04:07.547
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:10.550 --> 04:11.918
<i>- Is that good?</i>
<i>- Yep.</i>

04:11.985 --> 04:13.119
<i>Perfect.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:13.219 --> 04:14.821
<i>He complements</i>
<i>everything about me.</i>

04:14.921 --> 04:18.324
<i>It feels good because I haven't</i>
<i>had this feeling in so long.</i>

04:18.424 --> 04:20.260
<i>I like him like him.</i>

04:23.496 --> 04:25.798
<i>This is awful.</i>

04:26.599 --> 04:27.934
<i>It's good.</i>

04:29.969 --> 04:34.607
<i>So what do you think about the</i>
<i>new ladies that have joined us?</i>

04:34.674 --> 04:36.309
<i>You know,</i>
<i>they seem really nice.</i>

04:36.409 --> 04:38.845
<i>Nobody's turning my head.</i>
<i>That's for sure.</i>

04:38.945 --> 04:40.513
<i>Okay.</i>

04:40.613 --> 04:42.949
<i>I'm already focused.</i>

04:43.016 --> 04:45.418
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>I got my focus right now,</i>

04:45.485 --> 04:46.853
<i>a lovely young lady -- Deneia.</i>

04:46.953 --> 04:49.355
<i>And I'm gonna keep</i>
<i>my attention there.</i>

04:49.455 --> 04:51.791
<i>Thank you for joining me</i>
<i>for breakfast.</i>

04:51.858 --> 04:54.193
<i>I do really enjoy</i>
<i>your company a lot.</i>

04:54.294 --> 04:56.462
<i>I feel very comfortable</i>
<i>around you,</i>

04:56.529 --> 04:58.431
<i>and that's</i>
<i>really important.</i>

04:58.498 --> 05:00.700
<i>Yes.</i>

05:00.800 --> 05:02.502
<i>I feel the same way.</i>

05:07.774 --> 05:09.175
<i>5-10.</i>
<i>Comeback.</i>

05:09.275 --> 05:11.778
<i>Oh, wait.</i>

05:13.446 --> 05:15.348
<i>- There's another person here.</i>
<i>- No, you're --</i>

05:15.448 --> 05:16.649
<i>Dude,</i>
<i>I'm not playing, dude.</i>

05:16.716 --> 05:18.685
<i>- Oh, hello.</i>
<i>- Oh, hey. Oh.</i>

05:18.785 --> 05:20.153
<i>- What's up, bro?</i>
<i>- What's going on, boss?</i>

05:20.219 --> 05:22.689
<i>How you doing, bro?</i>
<i>I'm Miles.</i>

05:22.789 --> 05:23.823
<i>There's a boy.</i>

05:23.890 --> 05:25.058
<i>- What's up, dude?</i>
<i>- How you doing?</i>

05:25.158 --> 05:26.459
<i>- I'm Noah.</i>
<i>- Noah? I'm Brooks.</i>

05:26.526 --> 05:27.627
<i>- Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>- Nice to meet you.</i>

05:27.694 --> 05:28.895
<i>Come meet</i>
<i>all the people.</i>

05:28.995 --> 05:31.030
<i>My name is Brooks.</i>
<i>I'm 19 years old.</i>

05:31.130 --> 05:32.699
<i>And I've nominated</i>
<i>my dad, Joel.</i>

05:32.799 --> 05:34.734
<i>He's been out of the game</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

05:34.834 --> 05:36.135
<i>You know,</i>
<i>and I think definitely my mom</i>

05:36.202 --> 05:38.237
did quite a number on him,
so it's understandable

05:38.338 --> 05:39.906
<i>why he's been out of it</i>
<i>for as long as he has.</i>

05:40.006 --> 05:41.574
<i>He's right.</i>

05:41.674 --> 05:43.910
And I just think it's time.
I think he knows it's time, too.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.913
I want what's best for him.
I want to see him happy.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.582
Alright, everybody.
Want to introduce you to Brooks.

05:49.682 --> 05:50.750
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hello, Brooks.</i>

05:50.850 --> 05:51.984
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- What's up, everybody?</i>

05:52.051 --> 05:53.553
<i>Oh, Brooks,</i>
<i>I did forget to tell you</i>

05:53.653 --> 05:56.756
that while your father
is at the Second Chance Retreat,

05:56.856 --> 05:59.092
you'll have a chance to spy on
everything he does.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.194
<i>- No way!</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

06:01.260 --> 06:02.929
<i>But we'll</i>
<i>get to that later.</i>

06:03.029 --> 06:06.432
Brooks, your dad will be
joining the retreat today.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.101
<i>The parents have yet</i>
<i>to meet him,</i>

06:08.201 --> 06:09.869
<i>but before</i>
<i>they even meet him,</i>

06:09.936 --> 06:12.872
<i>he's gonna have a chance to go</i>
<i>on a date with somebody's mama.</i>

06:12.939 --> 06:14.774
<i>- Ooh!</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

06:14.874 --> 06:16.876
<i>But Brooks's dad is a lawyer.</i>
<i>Is that correct?</i>

06:16.943 --> 06:20.279
<i>That is true, yeah.</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:22.348
we love a good opening
statement, don't we?

06:22.415 --> 06:24.517
<i>- We do, indeed.</i>
<i>- Yeah, we do.</i>

06:24.584 --> 06:27.587
<i>So all the kids</i>
<i>with dope moms</i>

06:27.687 --> 06:30.123
are gonna have a chance
to describe your mom.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.393
And you get to pick who your dad
will go on a date with today.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.294
<i>- Spicy.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

06:35.395 --> 06:36.863
<i>I'll have you</i>
<i>have a seat.</i>

06:36.929 --> 06:38.464
<i>Brooks: This is something</i>
<i>I've always wanted to know --</i>

06:38.564 --> 06:40.366
<i>How does my dad act</i>
<i>on these dates?</i>

06:40.433 --> 06:43.302
<i>Part of me wants to do</i>
<i>what's best for my dad,</i>

06:43.403 --> 06:44.904
<i>but another part of me</i>

06:44.971 --> 06:48.207
<i>that's probably the larger part</i>
<i>of my ego</i>

06:48.274 --> 06:49.642
<i>wants to mess with him.</i>

06:49.742 --> 06:54.213
<i>Yvonne: Alright, so first up</i>
<i>in the hot seat is...</i>

06:54.280 --> 06:56.082
<i>Destiny.</i>

06:56.149 --> 06:58.751
<i>Yeah, come on up.</i>

06:58.818 --> 07:00.720
<i>Tell us a little bit</i>
<i>about Kiki.</i>

07:00.787 --> 07:04.157
<i>Alright. Kiki is fun.</i>

07:04.257 --> 07:06.726
<i>Brennen:</i>
<i>Stephanie is very outgoing.</i>

07:06.793 --> 07:09.762
<i>Breana: My mom, Karen,</i>
<i>is very strong-minded.</i>

07:09.829 --> 07:12.165
<i>Whitney:</i>
<i>My mother is very hilarious.</i>

07:12.265 --> 07:13.966
<i>MJ: I'm gonna say my mom</i>
<i>is delicious.</i>

07:14.066 --> 07:15.968
<i>Yvonne: Oh! </i>

07:16.068 --> 07:17.670
<i>Brooks, come on up.</i>

07:17.770 --> 07:19.806
<i>- Alright.</i>
<i>- Well, this is fun.</i>

07:19.906 --> 07:25.144
<i>So we have Kiki,</i>
<i>Stephanie, Deneia,</i>

07:25.244 --> 07:27.780
<i>Patricia, Karen.</i>

07:27.847 --> 07:29.649
<i>Who are you</i>
<i>thinking about?</i>

07:29.749 --> 07:32.618
<i>Um, my dad's kind of,</i>
<i>like, a pushover,</i>

07:32.685 --> 07:34.120
<i>I think, a little bit.</i>

07:34.187 --> 07:37.657
So I think a lot of these, like,
kind of confident adjectives.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.425
<i>I don't know how well</i>
<i>he'll do with that</i>

07:39.492 --> 07:40.793
<i>'cause my mom's like that.</i>

07:43.095 --> 07:46.933
I think he's a little scarred
from that kind of people, also.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.702
<i>I think I'm leaning</i>
<i>toward Patricia.</i>

07:49.802 --> 07:52.538
<i>- Patricia?</i>
<i>- Patricia.</i>

07:52.638 --> 07:54.941
<i>Alright, Brooks,</i>
<i>so, Patricia and your dad</i>

07:55.007 --> 07:57.343
<i>will be going</i>
<i>on an off-site date.</i>

07:57.443 --> 07:59.345
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

07:59.445 --> 08:03.149
Which means that you will be
going off-site undercover.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.351
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- And so will you.</i>

08:05.451 --> 08:07.053
<i>We're gonna have so much fun,</i>
<i>Brooks.</i>

08:07.153 --> 08:08.821
<i>Do we get, like,</i>
<i>disguises and stuff,</i>

08:08.888 --> 08:10.389
<i>like a big trench coat</i>
<i>or something?</i>

08:10.490 --> 08:12.458
<i>I feel like we can</i>
<i>work something out.</i>

08:12.525 --> 08:14.727
<i>Well, I'll let you</i>
<i>get acquainted</i>

08:14.827 --> 08:17.630
<i>with your new roomies,</i>
<i>and I'll be out.</i>

08:17.697 --> 08:18.731
<i>- Have fun.</i>
<i>- Awesome.</i>

08:18.831 --> 08:21.534
<i>Thank you, Yvonne.</i>
<i>Bye!</i>

08:24.237 --> 08:26.072
<i>I think we should go outside</i>
<i>and have a chat.</i>

08:26.172 --> 08:27.240
<i>A shot?</i>

08:27.340 --> 08:28.741
<i>Want to go outside</i>
<i>and have a chat?</i>

08:28.841 --> 08:30.743
<i>I thought you said a shot.</i>
<i>I'm like, "Okay."</i>

08:32.011 --> 08:34.080
<i>A shot?</i>
<i>Do we have a shot? Oh.</i>

08:34.180 --> 08:35.882
<i>Phill: It's nice to have</i>
<i>some new people in the mix.</i>

08:35.982 --> 08:37.750
<i>Today, I'm gonna get to know all</i>
<i>the ladies a little bit more,</i>

08:37.850 --> 08:40.753
<i>and hopefully maybe</i>
<i>as the day progresses,</i>

08:40.853 --> 08:44.657
<i>I'll have a better understanding</i>
<i>of who I'm attracted to.</i>

08:44.724 --> 08:47.760
<i>Tell me a little bit about</i>
<i>where you're from.</i>

08:47.860 --> 08:49.428
Just kind of tell me
a little bit more of that.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.730
<i>I felt like I had</i>
<i>this conversation,</i>

08:50.830 --> 08:53.032
<i>like, many times already.</i>

08:53.099 --> 08:54.667
<i>So how's things been</i>
<i>for you?</i>

08:54.734 --> 08:56.269
<i>Since I've been at the retreat,</i>
<i>pretty good.</i>

08:56.369 --> 08:58.504
So because you guys
had some time together

08:58.571 --> 09:00.940
<i>to get to share backgrounds</i>
<i>and all of that,</i>

09:01.040 --> 09:02.742
I didn't get a chance
to hear that, so...

09:02.842 --> 09:04.710
Well, I think each person will
tell you their little history --

09:04.777 --> 09:06.212
<i>No, I'm talking about you.</i>

09:06.279 --> 09:08.381
<i>Yes.</i>

09:08.447 --> 09:11.183
<i>Just start from there.</i>

09:11.250 --> 09:12.785
<i>I wouldn't say</i>
<i>I necessarily flirt.</i>

09:12.885 --> 09:15.621
<i>I mean, I'll to make eye</i>
<i>contact, and that's about it.</i>

09:15.721 --> 09:17.690
<i>Are you a go-with-the-flow type</i>
<i>of person?</i>

09:17.757 --> 09:19.525
<i>Are you a person</i>
<i>that sets the pace?</i>

09:19.592 --> 09:21.727
<i>Pretty much go-with-the-flow</i>
<i>type of person.</i>

09:21.794 --> 09:23.896
What are some of those areas
that you feel like,

09:23.963 --> 09:26.432
<i>"I'm leading the charge</i>
<i>on this"?</i>

09:26.532 --> 09:28.434
<i>I think has to do</i>
<i>anything with my work.</i>

09:28.534 --> 09:30.603
<i>That's pretty much it.</i>

09:30.703 --> 09:34.073
<i>It's been a few years since</i>
<i>I've seen my dad with a lady.</i>

09:34.140 --> 09:35.308
<i>Ugh.</i>

09:35.408 --> 09:38.644
<i>I'm very, how should I say,</i>
<i>straightforward?</i>

09:38.744 --> 09:40.880
I don't beat around the bush.
It's like -- I'm direct.

09:40.947 --> 09:44.417
<i>Okay, so be direct.</i>
<i>Am I your type?</i>

09:44.483 --> 09:47.720
<i>Um, now that I've opened up</i>
<i>to different opportunities,</i>

09:47.787 --> 09:51.757
I'm like -- because, A,
my type doesn't always work,

09:51.824 --> 09:55.127
<i>and we just look at someone</i>
<i>as far as physical.</i>

09:55.227 --> 09:58.497
But until you get to know the
person I'm realizing now, okay.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.232
<i>So the answer is yes.</i>

10:00.299 --> 10:01.968
<i>So the answer is yes?</i>

10:02.068 --> 10:04.904
'Cause you said you were direct
and then you taking me --

10:04.971 --> 10:06.505
<i>Am I your type?</i>

10:06.606 --> 10:08.007
<i>So I don't know.</i>

10:08.107 --> 10:11.911
<i>Kiki: Phill, he seems to have</i>
<i>a very calm demeanor.</i>

10:11.978 --> 10:17.016
<i>He seems to be a little bit</i>
<i>quiet and quite reserved.</i>

10:17.116 --> 10:20.252
<i>This is interesting,</i>
<i>but I'm gonna go along with it.</i>

10:20.319 --> 10:21.854
<i>Taking a chance.</i>

10:21.954 --> 10:23.155
<i>I'm very good</i>
<i>at taking a chance.</i>

10:23.255 --> 10:25.257
<i>I'm the same way.</i>
<i>I'm the same way.</i>

10:25.324 --> 10:28.861
<i>Who am I feeling right now?</i>
<i>I guess it would be Stephanie.</i>

10:28.961 --> 10:30.262
<i>We're good people.</i>

10:30.329 --> 10:32.798
You do the best you can
and you got to move forward.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.033
<i>It's called a life.</i>

10:34.133 --> 10:36.769
<i>I'm just not all there</i>
<i>with Phill.</i>

10:36.836 --> 10:38.971
<i>Total feeling there</i>
<i>as a friend vibe,</i>

10:39.038 --> 10:40.773
<i>but that's not why we're here.</i>

10:46.612 --> 10:49.348
I just want to chat with you
because I kind of felt

10:49.448 --> 10:51.050
like you were a little bit
distant last night,

10:51.150 --> 10:53.185
<i>and I just could feel</i>
<i>and sense it.</i>

10:53.285 --> 10:54.720
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Like, during our date?</i>

10:54.820 --> 10:56.822
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

10:56.889 --> 10:59.325
<i>So I just wanted to know,</i>
<i>like, are you --</i>

10:59.392 --> 11:01.060
<i>are you, like --</i>

11:01.160 --> 11:03.663
<i>You're pretty much</i>
<i>into Karen right now, right?</i>

11:03.729 --> 11:06.666
I just want to know just because
so I'm not spending more time

11:06.732 --> 11:08.834
and energy with you
that I don't need to.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.670
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- I respect that a lot,</i>

11:10.736 --> 11:11.904
<i>what your mom's saying.</i>

11:12.004 --> 11:13.305
<i>I actually, you know,</i>
<i>felt like</i>

11:13.372 --> 11:14.907
<i>we could have had</i>
<i>a much better conversation,</i>

11:15.007 --> 11:18.310
a much better time together,
and it was no fault of our own.

11:18.377 --> 11:19.745
<i>No, it was weird.</i>

11:19.845 --> 11:21.914
<i>I couldn't even, like,</i>
<i>remember what I was saying.</i>

11:22.014 --> 11:24.250
<i>Destiny: I think if that</i>
<i>incident didn't happen,</i>

11:24.350 --> 11:26.819
<i>I think they'd probably be</i>
<i>in a different place.</i>

11:26.886 --> 11:29.989
<i>I think this pushed Troy</i>
<i>more towards Karen.</i>

11:30.056 --> 11:33.325
What it's doing is solidifying
your like for Karen,

11:33.392 --> 11:35.928
<i>which is cool, because what is</i>
<i>happening is getting you closer</i>

11:36.028 --> 11:37.897
<i>to somebody</i>
<i>that you want to get to know.</i>

11:37.997 --> 11:40.666
<i>I definitely think that</i>
<i>we have had conversations,</i>

11:40.733 --> 11:42.601
<i>and, of course, you know,</i>
<i>every conversation is,</i>

11:42.702 --> 11:45.938
<i>wow, we kind of share</i>
<i>this value, we share that value.</i>

11:46.038 --> 11:47.606
But you guys have had
an opportunity to be together.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.776
<i>True.</i>

11:50.876 --> 11:53.579
<i>my point is, like,</i>
<i>you won't.</i>

11:53.679 --> 11:55.214
<i>Stephanie: He didn't say it,</i>
<i>but he said it,</i>

11:55.281 --> 11:57.750
<i>that he was probably</i>
<i>gonna be interested in Karen.</i>

11:57.850 --> 11:59.185
<i>They've had</i>
<i>longer time together.</i>

11:59.251 --> 12:00.853
<i>They've been able to connect</i>
<i>in a way</i>

12:00.920 --> 12:03.122
<i>that we weren't going to</i>
<i>be able to</i>

12:03.222 --> 12:05.758
<i>because, I mean,</i>
<i>his heart's somewhere else.</i>

12:05.858 --> 12:07.426
I don't feel like you're gonna
put your wall down.

12:07.526 --> 12:08.794
<i>I just don't.</i>

12:08.894 --> 12:10.596
<i>Maybe I have a wall there</i>
<i>a little bit. I don't know.</i>

12:10.696 --> 12:12.965
<i>You're a little cynical.</i>
<i>You're a little cynical.</i>

12:13.065 --> 12:14.800
<i>A little bit.</i>

12:14.900 --> 12:17.136
<i>Is that true?</i>

12:17.236 --> 12:18.471
<i>That's true.</i>

12:18.571 --> 12:20.873
<i>This is a great group</i>
<i>of people.</i>

12:20.940 --> 12:22.942
<i>Okay? So let's do this thing,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

12:23.042 --> 12:24.910
<i>Let's enjoy this.</i>

12:24.977 --> 12:29.582
<i>Let's just be us without</i>
<i>the wall and be vulnerable.</i>

12:29.648 --> 12:30.783
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- You know?</i>

12:30.883 --> 12:32.451
<i>You know, like,</i>
<i>she's entirely ready.</i>

12:32.551 --> 12:34.587
<i>She's ready</i>
<i>to find a husband.</i>

12:43.395 --> 12:45.164
<i>- Hey, Trish.</i>
<i>- Yeah, honey. Hi.</i>

12:45.264 --> 12:46.766
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>Good to see you.</i>

12:46.832 --> 12:49.235
<i>I always love seeing you,</i>
<i>Jimmy.</i>

12:49.301 --> 12:51.403
<i>It's good to see you, too.</i>
<i>Getting some sun?</i>

12:51.470 --> 12:53.172
<i>I am.</i>
<i>It's beautiful out.</i>

12:53.272 --> 12:54.940
<i>Yeah, it's a really nice day.</i>

12:55.007 --> 12:56.609
<i>Can I steal you</i>
<i>just for a second?</i>

12:56.675 --> 12:57.843
<i>Yeah, you sure can.</i>

12:57.943 --> 12:59.812
<i>Yeah, follow me.</i>
<i>We're gonna...</i>

12:59.912 --> 13:01.814
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- ...go through the house.</i>

13:01.914 --> 13:03.916
<i>Always fun</i>
<i>when Jimmy comes.</i>

13:03.983 --> 13:05.618
<i>Trish:</i>
<i>Here comes little Jimmy.</i>

13:05.684 --> 13:08.254
<i>We always know when he comes,</i>
<i>something's gonna happen, okay?</i>

13:08.320 --> 13:10.322
<i>- We have a car ready for you.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

13:10.422 --> 13:13.926
And we have a little journey
that we planned for you.

13:13.993 --> 13:17.029
<i>So you're gonna take this</i>
<i>carnation, go in the car,</i>

13:17.129 --> 13:20.933
and then when you leave,
all will be revealed.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.836
<i>Oh, Jimmy, opening the door.</i>
<i>Thank you, Jimmy.</i>

13:23.936 --> 13:26.205
<i>- You're welcome.</i>
<i>- I'm excited.</i>

13:30.209 --> 13:31.544
<i>- Alright, you ready?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

13:31.644 --> 13:33.646
<i>I'm so frickin' nervous.</i>
<i>Do you think they see us?</i>

13:33.712 --> 13:35.548
<i>No, there's no way.</i>
<i>We're too sneaky.</i>

13:35.648 --> 13:37.349
<i>Don't frickin' run.</i>
<i>Then they're gonna see us.</i>

13:37.449 --> 13:39.351
No, there's no way.
We got this, we got this.

13:39.451 --> 13:40.686
<i>There's no way.</i>

13:40.786 --> 13:42.321
<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>This looks so legit.</i>

13:42.388 --> 13:44.123
<i>It's like straight out</i>
<i>of a movie.</i>

13:44.190 --> 13:45.457
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

13:45.524 --> 13:48.027
<i>I'm very excited.</i>

13:48.127 --> 13:49.228
<i>They deserve this.</i>

13:49.328 --> 13:50.729
<i>Brooks:</i>
<i>This is important for my dad</i>

13:50.830 --> 13:53.165
<i>because he's changed a lot</i>
<i>these last few years.</i>

13:53.232 --> 13:55.734
<i>He's really found himself</i>
<i>being single.</i>

13:55.835 --> 13:58.838
<i>I want him to find love</i>
<i>and hopefully someone</i>

13:58.904 --> 14:02.241
<i>that he can enjoy</i>
<i>spending his life with.</i>

14:04.076 --> 14:06.178
<i>- Alright.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

14:06.245 --> 14:08.080
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Head over to that tree.</i>

14:08.180 --> 14:09.682
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

14:09.748 --> 14:13.085
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I'm about to shit myself.</i>

14:13.185 --> 14:15.421
<i>Aw, my mom's got a flower</i>
<i>for your dad.</i>

14:15.521 --> 14:17.923
Your mom kind of reminds me
of, like, a Muppet.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.093
<i>A Muppet?</i>

14:21.193 --> 14:22.261
<i>A freaking Muppet?</i>

14:22.361 --> 14:24.997
<i>Like, that is just</i>
<i>so disrespectful.</i>

14:25.064 --> 14:27.032
<i>Brooks has rubbed me</i>
<i>the wrong way,</i>

14:27.099 --> 14:28.500
<i>and we just now met.</i>

14:28.567 --> 14:31.070
<i>I literally don't know</i>
<i>how this date's about to go.</i>

14:31.170 --> 14:33.105
<i>Where's he at</i>
<i>right now?</i>

14:37.243 --> 14:38.544
<i>Is that your dad?</i>

14:38.611 --> 14:41.380
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>He's handsome.</i>

14:41.447 --> 14:42.414
<i>I know, right?</i>

14:42.514 --> 14:44.183
<i>Hi.</i>

14:44.250 --> 14:46.285
<i>How are you?</i>

14:46.385 --> 14:48.721
<i>Oh, thank you so much.</i>

14:48.787 --> 14:50.756
<i>Very nice to meet you.</i>

14:50.856 --> 14:52.057
<i>Nice meeting you.</i>

14:52.124 --> 14:53.792
<i>Yes.</i>

14:53.893 --> 14:55.427
<i>Yes. Are you excited?</i>

14:55.527 --> 14:57.630
<i>I am very excited.</i>

14:57.730 --> 14:58.964
<i>Hey, you know what?</i>

14:59.064 --> 15:00.799
<i>Everybody's got to be new</i>
<i>at some point.</i>

15:00.900 --> 15:03.969
<i>Trish: Joel, he has just</i>
<i>this cute little spirit.</i>

15:04.069 --> 15:05.237
<i>Just so sweet.</i>

15:05.304 --> 15:06.972
<i>So what are we doing?</i>
<i>What do we got?</i>

15:07.072 --> 15:10.376
<i>So today we have</i>
<i>a tandem bike.</i>

15:10.442 --> 15:12.978
<i>A tandem bike?</i>

15:13.078 --> 15:16.815
I've never even heard
what a tandem bike was. No.

15:18.651 --> 15:22.087
<i>Joel: My type of woman</i>
<i>is typically very active.</i>

15:22.154 --> 15:24.623
<i>I hardly sit still,</i>
<i>so I like a woman</i>

15:24.723 --> 15:25.991
<i>and I usually data a woman</i>

15:26.091 --> 15:27.726
<i>that's gonna be doing</i>
<i>a lot of activities.</i>

15:27.793 --> 15:29.461
<i>- Where are you from?</i>
<i>- I'm from Kentucky.</i>

15:29.561 --> 15:31.597
<i>- What about you?</i>
<i>- I'm from Miami.</i>

15:31.664 --> 15:33.165
<i>Miami?</i>

15:33.265 --> 15:35.000
<i>Brooks: Do you think your mom</i>
<i>would be willing</i>

15:35.100 --> 15:39.405
to uproot her life in Kentucky
and move to Florida?

15:39.471 --> 15:44.143
Oh, my God, my mom said
once my brother turned 18,

15:44.243 --> 15:45.778
<i>she wanted</i>
<i>to move to Florida.</i>

15:45.844 --> 15:47.513
<i>My brother's 19 now.</i>

15:47.613 --> 15:49.014
<i>- So I'd rather this hurt.</i>
<i>- Oop!</i>

15:49.114 --> 15:51.517
<i>I'm gonna rip your ear off now</i>
<i>or your earring.</i>

15:51.617 --> 15:53.786
<i>Alright.</i>

15:53.852 --> 15:56.188
<i>I am feeling so nervous.</i>

15:56.288 --> 15:58.324
<i>It's been a long time</i>
<i>since I rode a bike.</i>

15:58.424 --> 16:00.492
<i>And I probably flipped it.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

16:00.592 --> 16:02.094
<i>Like, I don't even remember.</i>

16:02.161 --> 16:05.531
<i>- Okay, I'm ready.</i>
<i>- We got it, Trish.</i>

16:05.631 --> 16:07.132
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>they're going fast.</i>

16:07.199 --> 16:09.501
<i>Alright.</i>
<i>How do you feel?</i>

16:09.601 --> 16:11.170
<i>You know, it's nervous.</i>

16:11.270 --> 16:12.705
<i>Joel:</i>
<i>Okay, now you can pedal.</i>

16:12.805 --> 16:14.606
I'm gonna be skinny,
time this thing's over.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.509
<i>Do you ever, like, ride a bike</i>
<i>or anything like that at home?</i>

16:17.609 --> 16:20.713
<i>Not tandem.</i>

16:20.813 --> 16:21.880
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

16:21.981 --> 16:23.482
<i>I don't bike</i>
<i>that often anymore.</i>

16:23.549 --> 16:27.720
<i>So this is definitely,</i>
<i>like, tiring.</i>

16:27.820 --> 16:29.488
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:29.555 --> 16:31.056
<i>Oh, yeah, I'm fine.</i>

16:31.156 --> 16:34.693
<i>Thank you for choosing my mom</i>
<i>to go on a date with your dad</i>

16:34.793 --> 16:36.562
'cause even though I know
she's so nervous right now,

16:36.662 --> 16:38.230
<i>she needed this</i>
<i>really, like, bad.</i>

16:38.330 --> 16:41.500
<i>I'm glad she's out here</i>
<i>having fun with my dad.</i>

16:41.567 --> 16:42.901
<i>Whoo!</i>

16:43.002 --> 16:44.903
<i>Shit.</i>

16:45.004 --> 16:46.238
<i>Oh.</i>

16:48.073 --> 16:50.909
<i>- Oh!</i>

16:52.511 --> 16:54.146
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

16:54.213 --> 16:55.814
<i>Oh!</i>

16:55.881 --> 16:56.915
<i>Is he okay?</i>

16:57.016 --> 16:59.151
<i>- You okay?</i>
<i>- Got me right in the rib.</i>

16:59.218 --> 17:01.020
<i>Trish:</i>
<i>The steering wheel?</i>

17:01.086 --> 17:02.421
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

17:02.521 --> 17:04.423
<i>He better not have</i>
<i>broken his fucking rib.</i>

17:04.523 --> 17:05.891
<i>I feel so bad</i>
<i>for both of them right now.</i>

17:05.991 --> 17:07.693
<i>Like, I literally want to cry</i>
<i>for both of them.</i>

17:07.760 --> 17:11.330
<i>Whew!</i>

17:11.397 --> 17:14.166
<i>We were starting</i>
<i>to go up an incline.</i>

17:14.233 --> 17:16.268
<i>We basically lost all momentum.</i>

17:18.537 --> 17:20.105
<i>I didn't want the bike</i>
<i>to fall on her.</i>

17:20.205 --> 17:23.075
<i>I tried to kind of, like,</i>
<i>jump down and break the fall,</i>

17:23.175 --> 17:24.943
<i>and the handlebar spun,</i>

17:25.044 --> 17:27.446
<i>and it basically went</i>
<i>right into my rib cage</i>

17:27.546 --> 17:31.617
<i>from here down to here</i>
<i>and just got me pretty good.</i>

17:32.918 --> 17:34.787
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I've never broken a rib.</i>

17:34.887 --> 17:36.755
<i>Trish: Don't know</i>
<i>what it feels like.</i>

17:36.855 --> 17:38.757
<i>I seriously don't know</i>
<i>what it feels like.</i>

17:38.857 --> 17:40.125
<i>I don't want to say it was funny</i>

17:40.225 --> 17:42.094
<i>because he did get</i>
<i>a little scratched up,</i>

17:42.194 --> 17:43.629
<i>but that's being with me.</i>

17:43.729 --> 17:46.799
<i>That's what happens</i>
<i>with Trish -- unexpected.</i>

17:48.100 --> 17:50.035
<i>You got to know</i>
<i>what you're in for.</i>

17:51.570 --> 17:54.640
I feel like a star going into
this nice black Suburban.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.643
<i>I know. You can't beat that.</i>

17:57.743 --> 17:59.211
<i>That's right.</i>

18:03.248 --> 18:04.950
<i>Brooks: That took</i>
<i>an unexpected turn.</i>

18:05.050 --> 18:07.653
<i>It did.</i>

18:07.753 --> 18:09.588
<i>That -- My heart dropped.</i>

18:09.655 --> 18:11.056
<i>Oh, my God, oh, my God.</i>

18:11.123 --> 18:12.758
<i>Meddle time.</i>

18:12.825 --> 18:15.227
<i>My first meddle time.</i>
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

18:15.294 --> 18:16.662
<i>"Whitney and Brooks,</i>
<i>hope you enjoyed</i>

18:16.762 --> 18:17.963
<i>watching your parents' date</i>
<i>today.</i>

18:18.063 --> 18:19.398
<i>Now they will get a chance</i>
<i>to enjoy</i>

18:19.465 --> 18:21.300
<i>a romantic</i>
<i>al fresco dinner.</i>

18:21.400 --> 18:24.470
However, in order to keep
this date lit in every way,

18:24.570 --> 18:27.339
you must continue to pedal
over 12 miles per hour

18:27.439 --> 18:28.941
<i>for the duration</i>
<i>of the date.</i>

18:29.007 --> 18:32.277
<i>Stop, and the lights go off</i>
<i>and the date is cut short."</i>

18:32.344 --> 18:34.346
<i>So we're powering</i>
<i>the light bulbs</i>

18:34.446 --> 18:36.515
<i>for wherever they're</i>
<i>having this thing at.</i>

18:36.615 --> 18:38.851
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I'm wanting to proceed.</i>

18:38.951 --> 18:41.086
I'm wanting to do it.
He almost broke his rib.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.822
They deserve it to be longer.
They deserve a longer date.

18:43.922 --> 18:46.692
<i>I agree. I agree.</i>
<i>I do.</i>

18:46.792 --> 18:49.161
So yes. Heck to the yes
for my mama and for your daddy.

18:49.261 --> 18:50.262
<i>Exactly.</i>

18:51.296 --> 18:52.498
<i>Troy: I don't know</i>
<i>what happened to Jimmy.</i>

18:52.598 --> 18:53.799
<i>I think Jimmy malfunctioned.</i>

18:53.866 --> 18:56.034
<i>Oh, shit! This is important.</i>
<i>This is vital.</i>

18:56.135 --> 18:57.269
<i>Maybe I slipped Jimmy</i>
<i>a $20.</i>

18:57.336 --> 18:59.671
<i>Troy: Yeah, maybe you did.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

18:59.771 --> 19:02.207
<i>But what happened last night</i>
<i>was, of course, not my idea.</i>

19:02.307 --> 19:04.843
<i>I had no idea. You and I both</i>
<i>were completely --</i>

19:04.943 --> 19:07.613
<i>More disrespectful</i>
<i>was you being pulled out,</i>

19:07.679 --> 19:10.616
being told for you and I
to go to the romance room.

19:10.682 --> 19:13.785
<i>She's gonna be</i>
<i>so pissed at me.</i>

19:13.852 --> 19:16.321
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>
<i>He's out with another woman.</i>

19:16.388 --> 19:17.789
<i>I tried</i>
<i>stopping it, Mom.</i>

19:17.856 --> 19:19.525
<i>I felt bad for the people</i>
<i>involved, actually.</i>

19:19.625 --> 19:21.894
And, yeah, and bad.
I felt very bad for her.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.395
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>Absolutely.</i>

19:23.495 --> 19:25.964
<i>- As did we, Dad. As did we.</i>
<i>- Yep, we really did.</i>

19:26.031 --> 19:29.067
<i>We came to this retreat</i>
<i>for a specific reason.</i>

19:29.168 --> 19:30.536
<i>And if they're seeing</i>
<i>a connection,</i>

19:30.636 --> 19:32.404
<i>they should be getting</i>
<i>that connection</i>

19:32.504 --> 19:35.040
<i>to see if it's truly</i>
<i>moving forward</i>

19:35.140 --> 19:36.675
<i>instead of trying</i>
<i>to put roadblocks up.</i>

19:36.742 --> 19:39.178
So what they're saying
is, instead of putting
roadblocks up,

19:39.244 --> 19:40.812
<i>we should just, like,</i>
<i>push them together.</i>

19:40.879 --> 19:42.014
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- I guess.</i>

19:42.080 --> 19:44.550
<i>The bigger</i>
<i>question here is,</i>

19:44.650 --> 19:46.652
<i>would you go on</i>
<i>a second date with her?</i>

19:46.718 --> 19:48.253
<i>I mean, in full disclosure,</i>
<i>I'd say sure,</i>

19:48.353 --> 19:50.255
I mean, because the date
was such a disaster.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.759
Okay, to me, see, then
I'm gonna take myself
out of the equation.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.060
<i>I don't fight for men.</i>

19:55.160 --> 19:57.029
<i>- Oh, did you hear that?</i>
<i>- Shit.</i>

19:57.095 --> 19:58.397
So I don't know. I guess
we have to kind of figure out

19:58.497 --> 19:59.698
<i>how to deal with that</i>
<i>and handle that.</i>

19:59.765 --> 20:01.200
<i>Clearly,</i>
<i>we like hanging out.</i>

20:01.266 --> 20:02.734
At some point we're gonna
probably get to do something.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.103
<i>They need a real date, though.</i>
<i>They really do.</i>

20:05.204 --> 20:06.705
<i>They need to lay in a bed</i>
<i>together, dude.</i>

20:06.772 --> 20:08.874
<i>- And no distractions.</i>
<i>- Straight up.</i>

20:08.941 --> 20:12.711
<i>I've tried sending my mom</i>
<i>out on dates with Scott,</i>

20:12.778 --> 20:15.447
<i>and I've tried sending her out</i>
<i>on a date with Philip.</i>

20:15.547 --> 20:17.115
<i>But after every date,</i>

20:17.216 --> 20:20.052
<i>she honestly</i>
<i>just ends up back with Troy.</i>

20:20.118 --> 20:24.189
<i>He makes my mom smile a lot.</i>
<i>They have a great time together.</i>

20:24.256 --> 20:27.793
<i>And I love seeing my mom</i>
<i>so happy with Troy.</i>

20:27.893 --> 20:31.263
<i>This could be the best thing</i>
<i>that we find here, you know?</i>

20:31.363 --> 20:33.198
<i>You know,</i>
<i>and I hope that's true,</i>

20:33.265 --> 20:34.800
<i>'cause that would be awesome.</i>

20:34.900 --> 20:37.970
<i>But when the next group</i>
<i>of people come through,</i>

20:38.070 --> 20:39.071
<i>you know, who knows?</i>

20:39.137 --> 20:40.639
<i>You might find that guy.</i>

20:40.739 --> 20:42.641
<i>Then I get friend-zoned.</i>

20:42.741 --> 20:45.277
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Really, Troy?</i>

20:45.377 --> 20:46.245
<i>I hope not.</i>

20:49.715 --> 20:51.250
<i>Dude, there's still</i>
<i>such strong --</i>

20:51.316 --> 20:52.417
<i>Are you serious?</i>

20:52.484 --> 20:54.152
Look how she's looking
at my dad right now.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.721
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

20:55.787 --> 20:58.056
<i>- There's something there.</i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

20:58.123 --> 20:59.658
<i>It's almost undeniable.</i>

20:59.758 --> 21:02.661
<i>I'm just thinking, I have your</i>
<i>back, and that's it, you know.</i>

21:02.761 --> 21:04.463
I think I'm picking up
what you're putting down.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.501
<i>They're so in love.</i>

21:09.601 --> 21:11.270
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

21:22.114 --> 21:24.182
<i>Stephanie: Our first party!</i>

21:24.283 --> 21:26.652
<i>Whoo! Let's go!</i>

21:26.752 --> 21:29.321
<i>I really want to come out of</i>
<i>this experience with somebody,</i>

21:29.421 --> 21:31.456
<i>and I've been here</i>
<i>a very little amount of time,</i>

21:31.523 --> 21:34.192
<i>so I'm hoping as time goes on,</i>
<i>that will happen.</i>

21:34.293 --> 21:36.194
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Come on, Steph.</i>

21:36.295 --> 21:38.597
<i>Just bring the alcohol,</i>
<i>you're good to go.</i>

21:40.198 --> 21:42.868
<i>Oh. Oh, look at my dad.</i>
<i>Wait. Oh, oh, oh!</i>

21:42.968 --> 21:44.970
<i>- What the --</i>
<i>- Come here, Pop. Oh.</i>

21:45.037 --> 21:47.439
<i>- Okay, Philip.</i>
<i>- Okay, he's really gettin' it.</i>

21:47.506 --> 21:48.607
<i>Go ahead, Pop.</i>

21:49.808 --> 21:51.677
<i>Philip:</i>
<i>Not even 90 degrees.</i>

21:51.777 --> 21:54.012
<i>My knees are good,</i>
<i>just so you know. I'm alright.</i>

21:54.112 --> 21:55.714
<i>Working on these legs this year</i>
<i>trying to get big.</i>

21:55.814 --> 21:57.049
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for letting me know</i>

21:57.149 --> 21:58.717
<i>When you're 52, you're like,</i>
<i>"So guess what.</i>

21:58.817 --> 22:00.819
<i>All of my joints are real,</i>
<i>and they all work."</i>

22:00.886 --> 22:02.321
<i>Yeah, 52.</i>

22:02.387 --> 22:03.789
<i>Breana:</i>
<i>Noah, look at our parents.</i>

22:03.855 --> 22:05.791
<i>- I know, I know.</i>
<i>- They're spinning each other.</i>

22:05.857 --> 22:06.958
<i>So adorable.</i>

22:08.727 --> 22:11.229
Oh, there's Phill.
Little Phil sandwich.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.331
<i>- I like that.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

22:12.397 --> 22:14.066
<i>I can't go any lower.</i>

22:14.166 --> 22:16.335
<i>Oh!</i>

22:17.469 --> 22:20.072
<i>Scott: Hey, baby.</i>
<i>Come here often?</i>

22:20.172 --> 22:22.574
<i>Man, you're looking so good.</i>

22:22.674 --> 22:25.711
<i>Woman: Oh, there goes Scott.</i>

22:25.811 --> 22:27.412
<i>- Whoa.</i>
<i>- Oh, whoa.</i>

22:27.512 --> 22:29.514
<i>- He's in his own world.</i>
<i>- Scott is a legend.</i>

22:29.581 --> 22:32.684
<i>What is...happening?</i>

22:34.686 --> 22:38.090
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>My condolences.</i>

22:44.529 --> 22:45.764
<i>Oh.</i>

22:50.268 --> 22:52.571
<i>I don't know. What do you guys</i>
<i>think as a team?</i>

22:54.106 --> 22:55.607
<i>Stephanie, Stephanie,</i>
<i>Stephanie, Stephanie.</i>

22:55.707 --> 22:57.042
<i>- Miles, who do you think?</i>
<i>- I think Stephanie.</i>

22:57.109 --> 22:58.677
<i>'Cause they were</i>
<i>talking earlier.</i>

22:58.744 --> 23:00.278
<i>That was very new.</i>

23:00.379 --> 23:01.847
<i>We'll go with Stephanie.</i>

23:08.053 --> 23:09.955
<i>No. Dude.</i>

23:10.055 --> 23:12.624
<i>- Miles!</i>
<i>- Bro, that's not even that bad.</i>

23:12.724 --> 23:13.792
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>that's not bad?</i>

23:13.892 --> 23:15.127
<i>The rest of the night!</i>

23:15.227 --> 23:17.562
My shoes were taken away
for the whole trip!

23:17.629 --> 23:19.798
<i>Do it for your dad.</i>

23:19.898 --> 23:21.933
<i>Nothing but support.</i>

23:23.101 --> 23:24.636
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

23:24.736 --> 23:26.037
<i>Yes, I wish to proceed.</i>

23:26.104 --> 23:29.574
<i>- I'm excited.</i>
<i>- Go, Miles!</i>

23:29.641 --> 23:31.810
<i>My dad definitely</i>
<i>deserves some help,</i>

23:31.910 --> 23:34.379
<i>but it's kind of confusing</i>
<i>to see which girl</i>

23:34.446 --> 23:35.947
<i>my dad is interested in.</i>

23:36.047 --> 23:39.251
<i>It seems like he's talking</i>
<i>and getting to know everyone.</i>

23:39.317 --> 23:42.053
<i>But I definitely feel like</i>
<i>this could help his situation,</i>

23:42.120 --> 23:45.757
<i>so I'm gonna for sure</i>
<i>proceed with this one.</i>

23:48.727 --> 23:50.762
<i>Man: Oh, shit.</i>

23:52.764 --> 23:54.332
<i>- Oh, my --</i>
<i>- Miles!</i>

23:54.433 --> 23:57.169
<i>- The shoes!</i>
<i>- Oh, my God, dude!</i>

23:57.269 --> 24:01.740
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>- Oh, the shoes, the shoes.</i>

24:03.642 --> 24:04.976
<i>- Dude!</i>
<i>- Bro, I swear.</i>

24:05.076 --> 24:07.512
<i>- You guys are crazy.</i>
<i>- Oh, my goodness.</i>

24:17.522 --> 24:19.424
<i>Whitney: Okay.</i>

24:19.491 --> 24:21.960
<i>Okay, so if we</i>
<i>get below 12,</i>

24:22.027 --> 24:24.863
<i>the lights are gonna go out,</i>
<i>so make sure --</i>

24:24.963 --> 24:28.433
<i>My mom had</i>
<i>not the greatest date today.</i>

24:28.500 --> 24:30.035
<i>We thought Joel broke his rib,</i>

24:30.135 --> 24:33.939
<i>but me and Brooks can have</i>
<i>our parents continue the date.</i>

24:34.005 --> 24:36.475
<i>We got to</i>
<i>keep the lights on.</i>

24:36.541 --> 24:38.043
<i>Okay.</i>

24:38.143 --> 24:40.145
<i>There it is.</i>

24:40.212 --> 24:43.849
<i>However, the sacrifice is,</i>
<i>we have to be on a bicycle</i>

24:43.949 --> 24:46.551
<i>going 12 miles per hour</i>

24:46.651 --> 24:48.186
<i>to keep the lights on</i>
<i>for their date,</i>

24:48.286 --> 24:50.455
<i>and if the lights go out,</i>
<i>the date is done.</i>

24:50.522 --> 24:54.059
This doesn't even feel that bad.
I feel like we can do this.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.961
<i>- Oh! Wow.</i>
<i>- Oh, wow.</i>

24:56.027 --> 24:58.730
<i>- Take a look at that.</i>
<i>- It's beautiful.</i>

24:58.830 --> 25:00.232
<i>- Man.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

25:00.332 --> 25:03.201
I don't know how they
get all this stuff done, huh?

25:03.301 --> 25:06.872
<i>We're right here</i>
<i>running for you guys.</i>

25:06.972 --> 25:08.206
<i>To second chances.</i>

25:08.306 --> 25:10.742
<i>To Second Chance Retreat</i>
<i>and second chances, yeah.</i>

25:14.312 --> 25:15.347
<i>Whitney: No.</i>

25:15.413 --> 25:16.648
<i>So have you ever</i>
<i>had a --</i>

25:16.715 --> 25:18.650
<i>Push it. Oh, shit.</i>

25:18.717 --> 25:20.519
<i>Oh.</i>

25:20.585 --> 25:23.355
<i>Holy freak, that burns.</i>
<i>That burns.</i>

25:23.421 --> 25:24.589
<i>I'm glad you're here.</i>

25:24.689 --> 25:26.658
<i>I flew from Miami.</i>
<i>You flew from Kentucky.</i>

25:26.725 --> 25:28.493
<i>We came to go on a date</i>

25:28.560 --> 25:31.196
<i>on a double-decker</i>
<i>Pee-wee Herman bike.</i>

25:31.263 --> 25:32.697
<i>I didn't know --</i>

25:32.764 --> 25:34.866
If I ever watch that movie
again, which I'm sure I will,

25:34.933 --> 25:37.202
<i>I will probably</i>
<i>run out of the room</i>

25:37.269 --> 25:38.570
<i>when I see him</i>
<i>on that bike.</i>

25:38.670 --> 25:40.105
<i>Don't let it hurt you.</i>

25:40.205 --> 25:41.373
<i>Trish: Joel, he's a good guy.</i>

25:41.439 --> 25:43.708
<i>He's fun and he just goes</i>
<i>with anything.</i>

25:43.775 --> 25:47.178
<i>He seems like just an amazing,</i>
<i>an amazing guy.</i>

25:47.245 --> 25:50.916
<i>Prior to this, like, have you</i>
<i>ever taken any type of risk,</i>

25:51.016 --> 25:54.019
not necessarily dating, but
in life, you know, really big?

25:54.085 --> 25:55.954
<i>No, I'm not really</i>
<i>a risk taker.</i>

25:56.054 --> 25:59.291
<i>Uh-huh. So this was</i>
<i>really out of your --</i>

25:59.391 --> 26:02.427
<i>This is just years of waiting</i>
<i>to open up</i>

26:02.527 --> 26:06.631
<i>and find myself</i>
<i>and find our love.</i>

26:06.731 --> 26:07.899
<i>It's like --</i>

26:07.966 --> 26:09.234
<i>Oh, I almost went under.</i>

26:09.301 --> 26:10.702
<i>It went to 12.1.</i>

26:10.769 --> 26:12.304
<i>I'm trying to see</i>
<i>how slow I can go,</i>

26:12.404 --> 26:13.805
<i>like, at the bare minimum.</i>

26:13.905 --> 26:15.774
<i>At the bare minimum.</i>

26:15.874 --> 26:17.976
When I meet that someone,
that means their family

26:18.076 --> 26:20.979
<i>coming into mine</i>
<i>and my family going into theirs.</i>

26:21.079 --> 26:23.214
<i>I mean, your kids</i>
<i>are the most important.</i>

26:23.281 --> 26:24.549
<i>It's love.</i>
<i>I mean, it's --</i>

26:24.616 --> 26:26.918
<i>Your kids want you</i>
<i>to have a relationship</i>

26:26.985 --> 26:28.286
<i>and find love, as well.</i>

26:28.386 --> 26:32.490
<i>Brooks: </i>
<i>It's not worth it.</i>

26:32.591 --> 26:34.392
<i>This conversation sucks.</i>

26:34.459 --> 26:36.628
<i>Brooks!</i>

26:37.929 --> 26:42.100
<i>The feeling in L.A.</i>
<i>kind of reminds me of Miami.</i>

26:42.167 --> 26:44.769
<i>Push it, Brooks.</i>
<i>Push it, Brooks.</i>

26:44.836 --> 26:47.772
<i>I'm dying.</i>
<i>I hate this.</i>

26:47.839 --> 26:49.274
<i>This is not fun at all.</i>

26:49.341 --> 26:52.277
<i>Patricia, I cannot tell</i>
<i>if she's flirting</i>

26:52.344 --> 26:53.945
<i>or if it's being friendly,</i>

26:54.012 --> 26:56.615
<i>but with my dad, I definitely</i>
<i>think he's just being friendly.</i>

26:56.681 --> 26:57.849
<i>I'm wanting to give up.</i>

26:57.949 --> 27:00.118
<i>Whitney, seriously,</i>
<i>I'm about to give up.</i>

27:02.153 --> 27:04.456
<i>Fuck this.</i>
<i>I'm not doing this anymore.</i>

27:06.791 --> 27:07.993
<i>You know, it takes effort,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

27:08.093 --> 27:10.762
<i>It takes one day a week</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

27:10.829 --> 27:12.030
<i>It's gone.</i>

27:12.130 --> 27:13.932
<i>It's gone, Whitney,</i>
<i>it's gone.</i>

27:13.999 --> 27:16.034
<i>Fuck, Brooks.</i>

27:16.134 --> 27:18.003
<i>Joel: I can tell</i>
<i>you're already --</i>

27:18.103 --> 27:20.205
<i>Like, there's</i>
<i>a fundamental change.</i>

27:24.843 --> 27:26.378
<i>Trish: Okay.</i>

27:26.478 --> 27:28.313
<i>- No worries.</i>
<i>- No problem, girl.</i>

27:28.380 --> 27:30.615
<i>Whitney:</i>
<i>I feel really fucking bad,</i>

27:30.682 --> 27:32.450
<i>'cause my mom</i>
<i>deserves the world.</i>

27:32.517 --> 27:34.819
You know, 'cause what if they
really do like each other?

27:34.886 --> 27:36.554
<i>It's just annoying.</i>

27:36.655 --> 27:39.557
<i>It's really admirable</i>
<i>how much love and respect</i>
<i>you have for your mom.</i>

27:39.658 --> 27:41.393
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>I love her to death.</i>

27:41.493 --> 27:43.061
<i>I just feel fucking bad.</i>

27:43.161 --> 27:45.397
<i>I truly wanted it</i>
<i>to be an amazing time</i>

27:45.497 --> 27:46.831
<i>for my mom and for Joel.</i>

27:46.898 --> 27:49.234
<i>And, you know, I wanted</i>
<i>this connection to spark,</i>

27:49.334 --> 27:52.037
<i>and I do feel like a failure</i>
<i>to my mom.</i>

27:52.137 --> 27:53.538
<i>It sucks.</i>

27:58.209 --> 27:59.544
<i>- You ready?</i>
<i>- I'm ready.</i>

27:59.644 --> 28:01.479
<i>Trish: You ready?</i>
<i>I'm ready to show you.</i>

28:01.546 --> 28:04.749
<i>- Alright, let's do it.</i>
<i>- Let's go meet everybody.</i>

28:06.851 --> 28:10.555
<i>- Tricia looks so gorgeous.</i>
<i>- Oh, my gosh.</i>

28:10.655 --> 28:13.191
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>
<i>Hello!</i>

28:18.530 --> 28:21.099
<i>Hi, Trish.</i>
<i>You've been missed!</i>

28:21.199 --> 28:23.735
<i>- Take a bow.</i>
<i>- I brought this boy, girls.</i>

28:23.835 --> 28:24.936
<i>That makes me happy.</i>

28:25.036 --> 28:26.671
<i>- Welcome. Stephanie.</i>
<i>- I'm Joel.</i>

28:26.738 --> 28:29.374
<i>- Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>- Nice to meet you, too.</i>

28:29.441 --> 28:31.109
<i>Kind of assessing the room for,</i>

28:31.209 --> 28:33.945
<i>do I see anybody that</i>
<i>I'm initially attracted to?</i>

28:34.045 --> 28:35.280
<i>- Karen. Hi.</i>
<i>- Karen?</i>

28:35.380 --> 28:36.781
<i>- Yes. Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>- Nice to meet you.</i>

28:36.881 --> 28:38.183
<i>Very nice to meet you.</i>

28:38.249 --> 28:41.419
<i>Both Karen and Stephanie,</i>
<i>I thought, "Okay, hey,</i>

28:41.519 --> 28:43.354
<i>those are two women</i>
<i>I'd like to meet."</i>

28:43.421 --> 28:46.391
<i>So Joel walks in,</i>
<i>and first thing I noticed</i>

28:46.458 --> 28:48.793
<i>was this very, very cool vibe.</i>

28:48.893 --> 28:50.929
<i>He's very good-looking.</i>

28:51.029 --> 28:52.764
<i>And so I want to engage</i>
<i>with him more</i>

28:52.864 --> 28:56.067
<i>and just kind of get to know him</i>
<i>a little bit better.</i>

29:14.919 --> 29:18.990
<i>Our little mud mask,</i>
<i>our caviar facials.</i>

29:19.090 --> 29:20.959
<i>So let's eat quick.</i>

29:21.059 --> 29:24.062
<i>Shower, pajamas.</i>

29:24.129 --> 29:26.064
<i>We're gonna meet</i>
<i>in a romance room.</i>

29:26.131 --> 29:28.733
<i>How do you take</i>
<i>this romantic moment</i>

29:28.800 --> 29:31.436
<i>and make it just perfect</i>
<i>at the end?</i>

29:31.503 --> 29:34.139
<i>Well, there are some other</i>
<i>nicer bedrooms in the house</i>

29:34.239 --> 29:38.009
<i>that if you should choose</i>
<i>to have some romantic time,</i>

29:38.109 --> 29:39.010
<i>you could go in there.</i>

29:39.110 --> 29:41.513
<i>So, I mean, this might be good.</i>

29:46.417 --> 29:48.253
<i>I hear you're amazing.</i>

29:50.855 --> 29:53.291
<i>I'm so excited to get a full --</i>
<i>a Phill --</i>

29:53.358 --> 29:55.860
<i>my Phill</i>
<i>and Phill massages.</i>

29:55.960 --> 29:57.262
<i>My foot Phill.</i>

29:58.630 --> 30:00.431
<i>I wouldn't say I'm</i>
<i>an expert foot rubber.</i>

30:00.498 --> 30:02.300
<i>But I do pretty good.</i>

30:02.367 --> 30:03.868
<i>It just comes natural.</i>

30:03.968 --> 30:05.703
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>

30:05.804 --> 30:08.873
<i>Oh, my God, your anticipation</i>
<i>is killing me.</i>

30:08.973 --> 30:10.975
<i>I'm so excited.</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

30:13.611 --> 30:14.646
<i>Ooh, it smells good.</i>

30:14.712 --> 30:16.781
<i>Does it?</i>
<i>What does it smell like?</i>

30:19.150 --> 30:20.218
<i>Ooh!</i>

30:20.318 --> 30:22.053
<i>As I'm giving Stephanie</i>
<i>a foot massage,</i>

30:22.153 --> 30:24.189
<i>I'm thinking, "Wow,</i>
<i>she got some rough feet."</i>

30:24.289 --> 30:27.492
Oh, you just have no idea how
much I appreciate and love this.

30:27.559 --> 30:30.728
<i>This feels so good.</i>
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

30:30.829 --> 30:33.798
<i>I'm a trouper, so I go ahead and</i>
<i>just make her feel comfortable</i>

30:33.865 --> 30:36.401
<i>and do the best I can.</i>

30:36.501 --> 30:39.137
<i>So when we were</i>
<i>talking earlier</i>

30:39.204 --> 30:42.707
<i>about, you know, like,</i>

30:42.807 --> 30:44.309
<i>hey, if, you know,</i>
<i>things work out</i>

30:44.375 --> 30:47.412
<i>and you go home</i>
<i>and tell your mom...</i>

30:47.512 --> 30:50.849
<i>Well, you never said anything</i>
<i>about your dad,</i>

30:50.915 --> 30:51.916
<i>how your dad would feel.</i>

30:52.016 --> 30:55.086
<i>He's awesome.</i>
<i>Oh, totally awesome.</i>

30:55.186 --> 30:57.755
<i>Super-great guy.</i>

30:57.856 --> 31:01.326
Like, you know, skin color, you
know, is not anything to him.

31:01.392 --> 31:05.597
He's been friends with people
of all different varieties,

31:05.697 --> 31:09.167
<i>and he would never, ever judge</i>
<i>somebody by the color of skin.</i>

31:09.234 --> 31:12.537
<i>He's a little deeper</i>
<i>than that.</i>

31:12.604 --> 31:14.572
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>the right word is.</i>

31:14.672 --> 31:19.277
There would be nothing weird
from anybody in my family.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.279
<i>My only concern would be</i>

31:21.379 --> 31:24.449
<i>that maybe you'll be</i>
<i>a little overwhelmed</i>

31:24.549 --> 31:25.917
<i>by the DeVoe family.</i>

31:26.017 --> 31:28.453
But I would certainly start
with just my parents.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.954
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:30.054 --> 31:32.891
And my daughters, you know,
who will absolutely adore you,

31:32.957 --> 31:35.627
<i>I'm sure --</i>
<i>Alexandra, you know.</i>

31:35.727 --> 31:40.298
My parents are fantastic.
They will adore you for sure.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.567
<i>- You think?</i>
<i>- For sure. I know.</i>

31:43.935 --> 31:45.970
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

31:46.070 --> 31:46.971
<i>Oh, my.</i>

31:47.071 --> 31:49.974
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>the grown-up room.</i>

31:50.074 --> 31:51.209
<i>Well, obviously I can't wait</i>

31:51.276 --> 31:53.244
<i>to get out of sleeping</i>
<i>on bunk beds</i>

31:53.311 --> 31:56.581
<i>with two other women,</i>
<i>who I adore, but still.</i>

31:56.648 --> 31:59.651
<i>I'm absolutely</i>
<i>looking forward to Troy,</i>

31:59.751 --> 32:03.588
<i>and I am so ready</i>
<i>for the experience.</i>

32:03.655 --> 32:05.456
<i>That feels so good.</i>

32:05.556 --> 32:06.824
<i>I like this.</i>

32:06.925 --> 32:10.094
<i>Just relax, right, be taken care</i>
<i>of for a little bit.</i>

32:10.161 --> 32:12.463
<i>- Pretend like you're at a spa.</i>
<i>- Alright.</i>

32:12.563 --> 32:14.499
<i>You have</i>
<i>really nice cheekbones.</i>

32:14.599 --> 32:16.834
<i>I already knew that,</i>
<i>though.</i>

32:16.935 --> 32:18.770
<i>You have a wonderful</i>
<i>bone structure,</i>

32:18.836 --> 32:21.739
<i>and I don't even know anything,</i>
<i>but I know that.</i>

32:21.806 --> 32:23.608
<i>You know what I mean?</i>
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

32:23.675 --> 32:24.809
<i>Mm.</i>

32:40.792 --> 32:42.260
<i>Normally you'd be first,</i>

32:42.327 --> 32:44.996
<i>but Trish is going</i>
<i>to be first today.</i>

32:45.096 --> 32:47.632
<i>I figured you would</i>
<i>see it that way.</i>

32:53.638 --> 32:55.540
<i>How was she when you</i>
<i>were doing her feet?</i>

32:55.640 --> 32:57.709
<i>Phill: She was relaxed,</i>
<i>laying down.</i>

32:57.809 --> 33:00.011
<i>She goes, "Wow, you are</i>
<i>really good."</i>

33:00.111 --> 33:02.146
<i>I said, "I told you."</i>

33:02.213 --> 33:04.649
<i>Well, hello,</i>
<i>little lady.</i>

33:04.716 --> 33:06.684
<i>- Good morning.</i>
<i>- Good morning.</i>

33:06.784 --> 33:08.286
<i>How was it?</i>

33:08.353 --> 33:10.488
<i>Oh, it was so sweet.</i>

33:10.555 --> 33:11.889
<i>And I had</i>
<i>the best sleep.</i>

33:11.990 --> 33:14.325
<i>Kiki: Oh, I'm sure.</i>

33:14.392 --> 33:15.727
<i>It's like, when he</i>
<i>got ready for bed,</i>

33:15.827 --> 33:17.362
<i>I was like, "Oh, I have</i>
<i>a husband tonight."</i>

33:17.462 --> 33:18.730
<i>Oh!</i>

33:23.634 --> 33:25.803
Yo, I'm truly
wondering what happened
last night, though.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.572
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>they did anything.</i>

33:27.672 --> 33:28.873
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I want to know.</i>

33:28.973 --> 33:30.408
<i>Maybe they kissed.</i>

33:30.508 --> 33:32.343
<i>Yeah, I felt like</i>
<i>that would be a possibility.</i>

33:32.410 --> 33:33.544
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

33:33.644 --> 33:34.979
<i>I thought it was coming.</i>

33:35.046 --> 33:36.247
<i>I mean, the dancing...</i>

33:36.347 --> 33:37.749
<i>...and then, like,</i>
<i>they were like</i>

33:37.849 --> 33:38.916
<i>in their own</i>
<i>little worlds.</i>

33:39.017 --> 33:40.351
<i>They're always</i>
<i>in their own little --</i>

33:40.418 --> 33:41.753
<i>You see, that is</i>
<i>what scares me about alcohol.</i>

33:41.853 --> 33:43.254
<i>I know, but they looked,</i>
<i>like, very...</i>

33:43.354 --> 33:45.390
<i>I thought they might</i>
<i>have kissed already.</i>

33:45.490 --> 33:47.091
<i>Right? Yeah.</i>

33:51.362 --> 33:53.197
<i>Do you like this shirt?</i>
<i>I think this shirt's cuter</i>

33:53.264 --> 33:54.899
<i>than what I got on.</i>

33:54.999 --> 33:57.235
<i>It's your birthday.</i>
<i>It's your birthday.</i>

33:57.335 --> 33:59.203
<i>Whoo!</i>
<i>And you're...48?</i>

33:59.270 --> 34:01.272
<i>46, yeah.</i>
<i>I was like, "How old am I?"</i>

34:01.372 --> 34:02.774
<i>I don't even know.</i>

34:02.874 --> 34:04.709
<i>I'mma set the tall glass</i>
<i>right here.</i>

34:04.776 --> 34:07.612
<i>How do you work with</i>
<i>that little knife?</i>

34:07.712 --> 34:09.614
<i>Carefully.</i>

34:09.714 --> 34:11.182
<i>Scott: Today is</i>
<i>Trish's birthday.</i>

34:11.249 --> 34:12.417
<i>Everybody's pumped today.</i>

34:12.517 --> 34:14.452
<i>I actually got up early</i>
<i>this morning</i>

34:14.552 --> 34:17.622
<i>because I'm gonna make</i>
<i>some breakfast for Trish.</i>

34:17.722 --> 34:18.790
<i>Gonna be a fun day.</i>

34:24.929 --> 34:26.798
<i>- Oh, surprise!</i>
<i>- Breakfast.</i>

34:26.898 --> 34:28.699
<i>All: Happy birthday!</i>

34:28.766 --> 34:31.135
<i>Ooh, yeah!</i>

34:38.409 --> 34:39.410
<i>Aww!</i>

34:39.477 --> 34:43.714
<i>All: Happy birthday!</i>

34:43.781 --> 34:45.316
<i>Deneia:</i>
<i>Happy birthday, girl!</i>

34:48.586 --> 34:51.456
<i>I love you guys!</i>
<i>Wh-Why now?</i>

34:51.556 --> 34:52.990
<i>It'll be all day!</i>

34:53.091 --> 34:56.127
<i>All of these amazing people</i>
<i>just giving all their love to me</i>

34:56.227 --> 34:58.129
<i>and focusing on just me...</i>

34:58.229 --> 35:00.164
<i>Thank you!</i>

35:00.264 --> 35:02.500
<i>Oh, I've had the best</i>
<i>birthday already.</i>

35:02.600 --> 35:04.402
<i>...I'm feeling like</i>
<i>one of those women</i>

35:04.469 --> 35:06.270
<i>that finally deserves something</i>

35:06.337 --> 35:08.606
<i>and have these amazing friends</i>
<i>coming at me.</i>

35:08.673 --> 35:10.074
<i>This is what love is.</i>

35:10.141 --> 35:13.744
One of the things that impresses
me so much about Trish --

35:13.811 --> 35:15.847
you know, when she talks about
her family and the love

35:15.947 --> 35:20.151
and all of the great things
that happen around her house.

35:20.251 --> 35:22.687
<i>And may</i>
<i>our relationship here</i>

35:22.787 --> 35:26.524
be some resemblance
of what you have at home.

35:26.624 --> 35:29.193
<i>You guys are my family</i>
<i>and just like my family,</i>

35:29.293 --> 35:32.763
<i>and will always be my family,</i>
<i>so I just...</i>

35:32.830 --> 35:36.467
<i>You guys are everything</i>
<i>I've ever wanted in friends.</i>

35:36.534 --> 35:38.503
<i>I didn't want to</i>
<i>get 'em all at one time</i>

35:38.603 --> 35:39.770
<i>that are so perfect, so...</i>

35:40.872 --> 35:42.840
<i>- It's a cry-off.</i>
<i>- Thank you, guys.</i>

35:48.379 --> 35:51.282
<i>So, guys, it is</i>
<i>Patricia's birthday today.</i>

35:51.349 --> 35:52.450
<i>- Whoo.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

35:52.517 --> 35:54.218
<i>I know.</i>

35:54.318 --> 35:55.353
<i>She's 46.</i>

35:55.453 --> 35:56.854
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

35:56.954 --> 35:58.456
<i>But, yes,</i>
<i>it's her birthday today.</i>

35:58.523 --> 36:01.659
<i>Do you think Brooks was</i>
<i>as determined as you were</i>

36:01.726 --> 36:03.561
<i>to, like,</i>
<i>keep the date going?</i>

36:03.661 --> 36:04.896
<i>He wasn't</i>
<i>determined at all.</i>

36:04.996 --> 36:07.965
<i>I feel absolutely terrible</i>
<i>because my mom</i>

36:08.032 --> 36:10.368
<i>had not the greatest date</i>
<i>with Joel.</i>

36:10.468 --> 36:11.636
<i>And, you know, with Brooks,</i>

36:11.702 --> 36:14.338
<i>I just could tell</i>
<i>he didn't want the date.</i>

36:14.405 --> 36:16.407
<i>Like, he wasn't really trying.</i>

36:16.507 --> 36:18.910
<i>Like, that just --</i>
<i>that really made me mad.</i>

36:19.010 --> 36:20.344
<i>Like, his dad's really,</i>
<i>really sweet.</i>

36:20.411 --> 36:23.347
But I'm more here for my mom
to find love than he is.

36:23.414 --> 36:27.151
Yeah, maybe he just
doesn't realize how
serious it actually is.

36:27.218 --> 36:28.853
<i>But, really,</i>
<i>it's -- it's serious.</i>

36:28.920 --> 36:30.655
<i>We care a lot.</i>

36:30.721 --> 36:32.423
<i>- Busted.</i>
<i>- Ah, Brooks.</i>

36:32.523 --> 36:34.158
<i>Uh, should I just</i>
<i>join this, or...?</i>

36:35.927 --> 36:37.862
<i>- Hopping in.</i>
<i>- And speaking of...</i>

36:37.929 --> 36:38.863
<i>Whitney: Hello!</i>

36:38.930 --> 36:40.364
<i>- Hi, Brooks.</i>
<i>- Hi, guys.</i>

36:40.431 --> 36:42.233
We're talking
about the date.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.268
<i>Aw. Oh, my God.</i>

36:44.368 --> 36:47.004
Do you want to explain, like,
your side of the date?

36:47.071 --> 36:49.774
It was a lot of fun.
You know, I felt very sneaky.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.242
<i>But, um, I don't know.</i>

36:51.342 --> 36:53.578
I couldn't tell how much
she was enjoying it.

36:53.678 --> 36:54.879
<i>In all honesty.</i>

36:54.946 --> 36:56.247
<i>PJ: Do you guys talk</i>
<i>about dating at all?</i>

36:56.347 --> 36:57.915
<i>Well, it's usually</i>
<i>more or less, like,</i>

36:58.015 --> 36:59.250
<i>he just shows me,</i>
<i>like, pictures of,</i>

36:59.350 --> 37:00.384
<i>like, who he's</i>
<i>going out with,</i>

37:00.451 --> 37:01.852
<i>and I, like,</i>
<i>give my approval,</i>

37:01.919 --> 37:03.521
and it's like, "Oh, good for
you, Dad. She's hot,"

37:03.588 --> 37:05.456
<i>and then send her</i>
<i>on his way.</i>

37:05.556 --> 37:07.725
<i>The date between</i>
<i>my dad and Patricia,</i>

37:07.792 --> 37:10.628
<i>I didn't think that my dad</i>
<i>was all that into it,</i>

37:10.728 --> 37:12.630
<i>and I'm not gonna force</i>
<i>something upon my dad</i>

37:12.730 --> 37:14.699
<i>that I know that he probably</i>
<i>doesn't want to do.</i>

37:14.765 --> 37:18.703
<i>I don't see my dad and Patricia</i>
<i>as a potential couple.</i>

37:18.769 --> 37:21.806
<i>We love Trish.</i>
<i>She's all our mama.</i>

37:23.574 --> 37:25.743
<i>Kiki: Did you have fun</i>
<i>last night?</i>

37:25.810 --> 37:29.647
You know, I keep diving into
the interracial thing.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.749
<i>I think it's important.</i>

37:31.816 --> 37:33.784
<i>'Cause, like,</i>
<i>what if this works out,</i>

37:33.884 --> 37:36.487
<i>and you, you know,</i>
<i>call your mom and say,</i>

37:36.587 --> 37:38.389
<i>"I met this wonderful</i>
<i>Black girl"?</i>

37:38.456 --> 37:40.057
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"What would she say?"</i>

37:40.124 --> 37:42.660
<i>And he was like,</i>
<i>"Oh, my mother is wonderful.</i>

37:42.760 --> 37:45.463
<i>She would love you,"</i>
<i>blah, blah, blah,</i>
<i>blah, blah, blah.</i>

37:45.563 --> 37:46.998
<i>"How do you think</i>
<i>your dad would feel?"</i>

37:47.098 --> 37:48.899
And he's like, "Oh, no,
my mom and dad are the same.

37:48.966 --> 37:50.668
<i>They would absolutely</i>
<i>love you."</i>

37:50.768 --> 37:53.004
<i>He was like,</i>
<i>"My family is crazy,</i>

37:53.104 --> 37:55.273
but they love -- you know,
love people," and so...

37:55.339 --> 37:59.176
<i>What about your children?</i>
<i>Do they have any views on</i>
<i>interracial dating at all?</i>

37:59.277 --> 38:02.146
<i>Well, my son, no,</i>
<i>'cause, oh, he dates, honey.</i>

38:02.246 --> 38:03.347
<i>Oh, you did say that.</i>

38:03.447 --> 38:05.349
<i>You know, everybody.</i>

38:05.449 --> 38:08.819
<i>My son dates outside of,</i>
<i>you know, his race all the time.</i>

38:08.919 --> 38:12.189
<i>And so, I think Myles</i>
<i>opened up my eyes to,</i>

38:12.290 --> 38:14.659
<i>that you can love anybody</i>
<i>and be with anybody.</i>

38:14.759 --> 38:18.963
<i>And then, just, Scott is just</i>
<i>so easy to be around</i>

38:19.030 --> 38:20.598
<i>and, you know, communicate with.</i>

38:20.665 --> 38:22.767
<i>But I'm concerned</i>
<i>about Scott's family.</i>

38:22.833 --> 38:25.536
<i>Is his family</i>
<i>going to accept me?</i>

38:25.636 --> 38:27.705
<i>My mother, she wouldn't care.</i>
<i>My brothers would be shocked.</i>

38:27.805 --> 38:28.706
<i>Like...</i>

38:30.441 --> 38:32.043
<i>But they wouldn't care, at all.</i>

38:32.143 --> 38:34.712
<i>So, this --</i>
<i>you're a singer, or...?</i>

38:34.812 --> 38:35.813
<i>Stephanie: Yes.</i>

38:35.880 --> 38:37.548
<i>I own a band.</i>

38:37.648 --> 38:39.317
<i>You own a band?</i>

38:39.383 --> 38:41.285
<i>So, I never heard it</i>
<i>quite said that way.</i>

38:41.352 --> 38:43.854
<i>So you actually own</i>
<i>a band?</i>

38:43.954 --> 38:45.222
<i>That's awesome.</i>

38:45.323 --> 38:46.691
<i>I am</i>
<i>a lead singer of it.</i>

38:46.791 --> 38:48.693
I have some other girls
that I'm working in.

38:48.793 --> 38:51.729
Eventually, I want to phase
myself out of the smaller gigs,

38:51.829 --> 38:52.897
<i>let the girls take over,</i>

38:52.997 --> 38:55.566
<i>and then I'll come out</i>
<i>for larger.</i>

38:55.666 --> 38:57.034
<i>How old are you?</i>

38:57.134 --> 38:59.170
<i>How old are you?</i>

38:59.236 --> 39:00.404
<i>You don't look 51.</i>

39:00.504 --> 39:02.907
<i>But what do you think</i>
<i>has been your secret</i>

39:03.007 --> 39:05.843
<i>to staying and looking young,</i>
<i>if you have one?</i>

39:05.910 --> 39:07.511
<i>Well, it's probably the same</i>
<i>as you, too.</i>

39:07.578 --> 39:10.014
<i>I mean, you got to keep</i>
<i>your body healthy.</i>

39:10.081 --> 39:12.717
<i>You're always active.</i>
<i>Like, you're always...</i>

39:12.817 --> 39:16.854
So, yeah, I've always been
extremely just active, maybe.

39:16.921 --> 39:20.591
<i>I love it that you're so,</i>
<i>like, healthy.</i>

39:20.691 --> 39:22.326
<i>It's good.</i>

39:22.393 --> 39:23.427
<i>I mean...</i>

39:23.527 --> 39:24.595
<i>When you look great</i>
<i>like you do,</i>

39:24.695 --> 39:26.230
<i>I mean...</i>

39:26.330 --> 39:29.200
<i>It's an inspiration</i>
<i>for people, I think, right?</i>

39:29.266 --> 39:32.403
<i>I finally get some time with</i>
<i>Stephanie to hang out and talk,</i>

39:32.503 --> 39:34.772
<i>and first of all, of course,</i>
<i>she looks gorgeous.</i>

39:34.872 --> 39:38.275
<i>She's a beautiful woman,</i>
<i>and I start to, you know,</i>

39:38.376 --> 39:40.444
<i>quickly see she is, I think,</i>

39:40.544 --> 39:42.380
<i>very young in spirit,</i>
<i>like myself,</i>

39:42.446 --> 39:45.282
<i>which is cool 'cause that's the</i>
<i>type of person I'm looking for.</i>

39:45.383 --> 39:46.851
<i>And I want to</i>
<i>take advantage of life.</i>

39:46.917 --> 39:49.620
Why not live life to its fullest
as healthy as possible

39:49.720 --> 39:52.423
<i>and do as many fun things</i>
<i>as possible?</i>

39:52.523 --> 39:54.125
<i>These are my best days.</i>

39:54.225 --> 39:56.627
<i>Stephanie: Joel is</i>
<i>a very nice guy.</i>

39:56.727 --> 39:58.362
<i>He has great confidence,</i>

39:58.429 --> 40:00.398
<i>zero problem</i>
<i>getting to know people.</i>

40:00.464 --> 40:03.734
<i>I'm gonna be open</i>
<i>and see where it goes.</i>

40:03.801 --> 40:06.470
<i>I'm more excited</i>
<i>about my future...</i>

40:06.570 --> 40:10.074
...than reminiscing about
the great times in the past.

40:10.141 --> 40:11.108
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

40:14.745 --> 40:15.813
<i>That's what I figured.</i>

40:15.913 --> 40:16.981
<i>It's like,</i>
<i>what are they gonna do?</i>

40:17.081 --> 40:18.282
<i>Yvonne:</i>
<i>Knock, knock, knock.</i>

40:18.382 --> 40:20.584
<i>- Oh, hello.</i>
<i>- Yvonne -- the return.</i>

40:20.651 --> 40:21.986
<i>Noah: Yvonne, it's great</i>
<i>to see you today.</i>

40:22.086 --> 40:24.488
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

40:24.588 --> 40:26.157
<i>- Come on!</i>
<i>- Guys!</i>

40:26.257 --> 40:28.325
<i>That's a nice blazer</i>
<i>you got on.</i>

40:28.426 --> 40:30.828
<i>Alright, so you guys know,</i>
<i>when I normally come in,</i>

40:30.928 --> 40:33.798
<i>it's usually to deliver</i>
<i>some kind of fun news,</i>

40:33.898 --> 40:35.599
<i>some plot twists.</i>

40:35.666 --> 40:39.503
<i>But, unfortunately, today, I am</i>
<i>coming with heartbreaking news.</i>

40:42.807 --> 40:45.176
<i>One of your parents</i>
<i>has to go home.</i>

40:45.276 --> 40:47.578
<i>Today?</i>

40:49.780 --> 40:52.817
<i>The aim of the Second Chance</i>
<i>Retreat is to help your parents</i>

40:52.917 --> 40:57.021
<i>find a second chance at love</i>
<i>and to make a real connection.</i>

40:57.121 --> 40:59.023
<i>Now, if one of your parents</i>
<i>is unable</i>

40:59.123 --> 41:02.693
<i>to make that real connection,</i>
<i>then I think you will agree</i>

41:02.793 --> 41:05.663
<i>that it's only fair</i>
<i>that we free up space</i>

41:05.763 --> 41:10.367
<i>to help the other parents find</i>
<i>that very real connection.</i>

41:10.468 --> 41:12.436
<i>So, our team deliberated</i>

41:12.503 --> 41:14.538
<i>on whether it would be</i>
<i>one of your moms</i>

41:14.638 --> 41:16.974
<i>or one of your dads</i>
<i>that would be leaving.</i>

41:19.276 --> 41:22.213
<i>And it was decided...</i>

41:22.313 --> 41:26.317
<i>that it will indeed be</i>
<i>one of the dads leaving today.</i>

41:26.383 --> 41:27.852
<i>Hmm.</i>

41:27.952 --> 41:30.554
<i>If your dad</i>
<i>is selected to leave,</i>

41:30.654 --> 41:34.191
<i>that means you also will be</i>
<i>leaving the bunker.</i>

41:34.291 --> 41:37.561
<i>Now, the question remains,</i>
<i>which dad will it be?</i>

41:37.661 --> 41:40.297
<i>That is actually gonna be</i>
<i>left up to you all.</i>

41:40.364 --> 41:42.666
<i>Breana: Ooh, man.</i>

41:42.733 --> 41:44.869
<i>I don't want to send</i>
<i>anyone home.</i>

41:44.969 --> 41:48.506
<i>This could negatively affect</i>
<i>the Parents' House.</i>

41:48.572 --> 41:52.076
<i>They've all also grown so close.</i>

41:52.176 --> 41:54.845
<i>Each one of you will</i>
<i>head up to the war room</i>

41:54.912 --> 41:59.049
<i>and anonymously vote</i>
<i>for which dad you feel</i>

41:59.149 --> 42:02.586
<i>is not making a good connection</i>
<i>to leave the retreat.</i>

42:02.686 --> 42:05.155
<i>And, Brooks, because your dad</i>
<i>has been at the retreat</i>

42:05.222 --> 42:08.726
<i>for less than 24 hours,</i>
<i>he will be exempt from removal,</i>

42:08.826 --> 42:12.229
<i>which also means that you will</i>
<i>be exempt from casting a ballot.</i>

42:12.329 --> 42:13.397
<i>It was</i>
<i>such a good day.</i>

42:13.497 --> 42:15.032
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:15.099 --> 42:16.767
<i>I don't like this</i>
<i>at all.</i>

42:16.867 --> 42:18.769
<i>The first person up</i>
<i>is Whitney.</i>

42:18.869 --> 42:19.904
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

42:21.238 --> 42:22.172
<i>You got this.</i>

42:34.552 --> 42:36.954
<i>I do not like this at all.</i>
<i>Like, this sucks.</i>

42:39.757 --> 42:46.463
<i>Miles' dad, Noah's dad,</i>
<i>PJ's dad, Alex's dad.</i>

42:46.564 --> 42:50.601
<i>It's also a person in our house</i>
<i>that we're having to nominate.</i>

42:50.701 --> 42:54.305
<i>And right now, like, we're all</i>
<i>family, so it's very hard.</i>

42:54.405 --> 42:55.940
<i>I don't want anybody to go home.</i>

42:56.040 --> 42:57.875
<i>I don't wanna put --</i>
<i>I don't wanna put Phill.</i>

42:57.942 --> 43:00.978
<i>Phill has got a real chance,</i>
<i>has really, like, tried,</i>

43:01.078 --> 43:03.213
<i>and, like, Stephanie</i>
<i>just got there.</i>

43:10.220 --> 43:11.822
<i>Breana:</i>
<i>This is so hard.</i>

43:11.922 --> 43:16.327
<i>Obviously, Troy has made</i>
<i>a connection with my mom,</i>

43:16.427 --> 43:18.996
<i>Scott with Deneia.</i>

43:19.096 --> 43:22.766
<i>Phill hasn't really had</i>
<i>a chance, kind of, yet.</i>

43:22.833 --> 43:26.236
<i>And then I feel like Philip has</i>
<i>been kind of bouncing around.</i>

43:26.303 --> 43:28.939
<i>I'm stuck between</i>
<i>the two Philips.</i>

43:30.441 --> 43:31.742
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

43:35.079 --> 43:36.513
<i>Can't be my own dad, obviously.</i>

43:36.614 --> 43:38.282
<i>Sadly, I have to go</i>
<i>with Philip Sr.</i>

43:38.349 --> 43:40.317
<i>This is horrible.</i>

43:48.425 --> 43:52.763
<i>I am not happy whatsoever,</i>
<i>because the house here</i>

43:52.830 --> 43:54.198
<i>and the people</i>
<i>I'm surrounded by,</i>

43:54.298 --> 43:57.668
<i>we have created such</i>
<i>a strong bond together.</i>

43:57.768 --> 43:59.703
<i>I can't picture</i>
<i>the rest of my stay here</i>

43:59.803 --> 44:01.038
<i>at the bunker without everyone,</i>

44:01.138 --> 44:02.873
<i>and I know everyone</i>
<i>probably feels the same.</i>

44:02.973 --> 44:03.874
<i>It just sucks.</i>

44:06.343 --> 44:07.811
<i>PJ, you are the last.</i>

44:07.878 --> 44:09.947
<i>And when you're done,</i>
<i>please bring down the ballot.</i>

44:10.014 --> 44:11.715
<i>Alright.</i>

44:15.052 --> 44:16.453
<i>PJ: As I'm coming</i>
<i>to this decision,</i>

44:16.520 --> 44:20.290
<i>I'm trying to decide between</i>
<i>my dad or Phill C.</i>

44:20.357 --> 44:22.559
<i>My dad, he has kind of been</i>

44:22.660 --> 44:24.828
<i>really relaxed</i>
<i>about the whole process.</i>

44:24.895 --> 44:26.730
<i>That can be detrimental</i>
<i>in a situation like this,</i>

44:26.830 --> 44:28.365
<i>where you have to be efficient.</i>

44:28.465 --> 44:31.201
<i>And I knew that it was either</i>
<i>gonna be my dad or Phill C</i>

44:31.301 --> 44:32.236
<i>that was gonna have to go.</i>

44:37.174 --> 44:39.810
<i>Thank you.</i>

44:39.877 --> 44:41.078
<i>Alright.</i>

44:41.178 --> 44:42.813
<i>I have all</i>
<i>the ballots here.</i>

44:42.880 --> 44:45.849
<i>It has been lovely getting to</i>
<i>know each and every one of you,</i>

44:45.916 --> 44:46.984
<i>and I'll see you soon.</i>

44:47.051 --> 44:48.018
<i>- Bye, Yvonne.</i>
<i>- Bye.</i>

44:48.085 --> 44:49.319
<i>- Bye, Yvonne.</i>
<i>- Later.</i>

44:54.591 --> 44:56.193
<i>Knock, knock, knock.</i>

44:56.260 --> 44:57.428
<i>Hey!</i>

44:57.528 --> 44:59.229
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>- Hey!</i>

44:59.329 --> 45:01.598
<i>They're in such</i>
<i>a good mood.</i>

45:01.699 --> 45:02.766
<i>Fuck.</i>

45:02.866 --> 45:04.401
<i>As you guys know,</i>
<i>normally, when I come,</i>

45:04.501 --> 45:08.372
<i>I bring sort of good news,</i>
<i>most of the time.</i>

45:08.439 --> 45:11.041
<i>Today,</i>
<i>I have not the greatest news.</i>

45:11.108 --> 45:12.443
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

45:12.543 --> 45:14.845
So, remember, we told you
when you first moved in

45:14.912 --> 45:18.115
<i>that even though we started out</i>
<i>with seven of you,</i>

45:18.215 --> 45:21.018
<i>it may not</i>
<i>stay that way?</i>

45:21.085 --> 45:23.387
<i>Well, now that we've</i>
<i>added a new dad,</i>

45:23.454 --> 45:24.722
<i>we need to make space</i>

45:24.788 --> 45:27.091
<i>so other dads have a chance</i>
<i>to find love.</i>

45:27.191 --> 45:30.694
Therefore, somebody has
to leave the retreat.

45:30.761 --> 45:32.529
<i>Oh.</i>

45:32.596 --> 45:36.200
<i>The person going home today</i>
<i>will be a dad.</i>

45:36.266 --> 45:38.602
<i>Troy: I'm terrified.</i>

45:38.702 --> 45:40.604
<i>I am worried about</i>
<i>whoever it's gonna be,</i>

45:40.704 --> 45:41.872
<i>how that's gonna impact them,</i>

45:41.939 --> 45:43.874
<i>and really impact</i>
<i>the rest of us, too.</i>

45:43.941 --> 45:45.242
<i>You know, I'm feeling</i>
<i>pretty safe.</i>

45:45.309 --> 45:46.810
<i>I'm thinking Philip or Phill,</i>

45:46.910 --> 45:50.481
<i>and bracing for the kick</i>
<i>to the balls which is to come.</i>

45:52.916 --> 45:54.218
<i>I am sad to say</i>

45:54.284 --> 45:58.555
that the dad leaving
the retreat today is...
