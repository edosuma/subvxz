Dads <i>is recorded in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:18.886 --> 00:23.889
Hey, uh, do you know any
good place to get Thai food?

00:25.859 --> 00:30.029
I said, "Can you recommend
a good Thai restaurant?"

00:30.031 --> 00:32.331
And you're asking me.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.233
Yeah. Obviously.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.335
Why me?

00:36.337 --> 00:40.372
Because you have a cousin
named Wai Mi.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.342
(whining):
Warner, Eli's being racist.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.978
Eli, stop being racist.

00:45.980 --> 00:49.915
(whining):
But Veronica won't give me
Thai restaurant recommendations.

00:49.917 --> 00:53.385
Veronica, give Eli
Thai restaurant recommendations.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.486
But I don't eat Thai.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.955
Everything tastes
like spicy pets.

01:05.865 --> 01:08.367
Now you're being racist.
(scoffs)

01:08.369 --> 01:11.203
You're not racist if you're
making fun of your own race.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.205
Hey, hey.
Let's just leave what's racist

01:13.207 --> 01:15.340
up to the white media, okay?

01:19.245 --> 01:22.181
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

01:22.183 --> 01:24.216
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:24.218 --> 01:28.220
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

01:28.222 --> 01:30.255
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

01:30.257 --> 01:34.526
¶ So many stars up in the sky

01:34.528 --> 01:39.098
¶ So many questions have I

01:39.100 --> 01:41.233
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:41.235 --> 01:43.836
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.808
Dad, I just bought
this conditioner yesterday.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.243
How did you already use it all?

01:51.245 --> 01:52.311
Don't ask questions
you don't want

01:52.313 --> 01:54.980
to hear the answer to.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.419
Did you eat the last
of the cereal?

02:00.421 --> 02:03.322
And the last of the eggs?

02:03.324 --> 02:07.226
I lost a lot of protein
in the shower.

02:10.763 --> 02:14.566
How you drink so much coffee
then snore all day?

02:14.568 --> 02:16.401
I don't snore.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.237
<i>Sí,</i> you snore.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.406
You tilt your big fat head back,

02:21.408 --> 02:23.909
open big fat mouth

02:23.911 --> 02:29.181
and make sound
like big fat Jewish donkey.

02:30.450 --> 02:33.519
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

02:33.521 --> 02:35.420
Hee-haw!

02:35.422 --> 02:38.524
You're on the phone all day,

02:38.526 --> 02:40.459
yakkata bappita, <i>cinco de cinco.</i>

02:40.461 --> 02:42.161
What do you even talk about?

02:43.363 --> 02:44.530
"I'm vacuuming.
What are you doing?"

02:44.532 --> 02:46.632
"Vacuuming."

02:46.634 --> 02:49.535
You make that up.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.204
This is the worst episode
of <i>Crossfire</i> ever.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.672
Listen, Dad,

02:53.674 --> 02:57.409
from now on, no more eating
my food without my permission.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.681
What are you doing?

03:02.683 --> 03:05.017
Oh, if you want something, you
can just come down to my office

03:05.019 --> 03:06.952
and ask for it.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.020
You can't lock the fridge.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.656
I need food to live.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.458
I know.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.061
(phone rings)

03:19.566 --> 03:21.633
This not a good time.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.606
Vacuuming.

03:29.642 --> 03:31.310
(snoring softly)

03:37.584 --> 03:39.751
Dad, wake up!
Ah!
(mutters)

03:39.753 --> 03:43.255
You almost set yourself
on fire, Crawford.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.090
Well, never mind that.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.559
I just dreamed
a million dollar idea.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.061
Really?
Yeah.

03:49.063 --> 03:51.029
You know how so many
of our parents are dead?

03:51.031 --> 03:53.498
Oh, cha-ching.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.068
Okay, what if there was
a service where you could call

03:56.070 --> 03:59.571
and have two people who look
vaguely like your dead parents

03:59.573 --> 04:01.506
come over and hang out?

04:01.508 --> 04:03.175
Huh?

04:03.177 --> 04:05.744
Just imagine, uh, the thrill
o-of playing catch

04:05.746 --> 04:09.081
with a-a stranger who,
if you take your glasses off,

04:09.083 --> 04:11.717
could be your dad.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.952
Would he come and fall asleep
on the couch with a lit cigar

04:13.954 --> 04:15.520
in his mouth like you just did?

04:15.522 --> 04:16.688
I'm sorry, Smokey the Bear.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.391
That's how I do
my best thinking.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.960
Okay, what if the cigar
caught the couch on fire

04:21.962 --> 04:23.528
and the flames
hit the scotch?

04:23.530 --> 04:25.797
What am I, a scientist?

04:25.799 --> 04:27.799
Okay. If you fall asleep
just one more time

04:27.801 --> 04:30.235
with a lit cigar in your
mouth, I will take bug spray

04:30.237 --> 04:33.405
and a lighter and I will
set you on fire myself. Okay?

04:33.407 --> 04:34.906
I'm gonna do it.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.576
Well, it sounds like you
might soon be in the market

04:37.578 --> 04:40.045
for a look-alike dad.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.714
Dad, this just says "Business."

04:42.716 --> 04:44.049
Yeah. It's from a board game.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.084
The others say
"Pleasure" and "Sex."

04:46.086 --> 04:48.220
(chuckles)

04:57.397 --> 04:59.898
Hey.

04:59.900 --> 05:04.469
Those are the carnitas that
Edna made special for me.

05:04.471 --> 05:08.073
You don't want something eaten,
don't leave it in the fridge.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.443
But... h...

05:11.445 --> 05:13.011
how did you...
They haven't made
the refrigerator

05:13.013 --> 05:16.281
I can't break food out of.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.183
By the way,

05:18.185 --> 05:19.618
I refilled the ice tray.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.753
You're welcome.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.325
Dad, there was a clean towel in
here when I left this morning.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.526
You mean this one?

05:27.528 --> 05:30.429
Sorry, I'm saving it
for my shower.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.964
No, no. I gave you towels.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.366
Whenever you use mine,
they wind up looking

05:34.368 --> 05:37.502
like they're from a
World War I hospital.

05:37.504 --> 05:41.440
I don't even know what
bodily fluids are those colors.

05:42.542 --> 05:46.345
It's the black blood
from my toes.

05:47.714 --> 05:51.049
You should be getting that
in about six years.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.551
Give me the towel, Dad.
It's mine.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.987
I'll only use one side.
The rest is all yours.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.557
Both sides are mine.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.459
Give me the towel.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.461
Edna! Stop him before he gets
to the bathroom!

06:02.463 --> 06:04.596
Copy that, boss!

06:11.738 --> 06:13.739
I don't want to kill you,
Edna, but I will.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.308
Edna laughs at death.

06:16.310 --> 06:19.044
(laughs)

06:19.046 --> 06:21.346
Nice work, Edna. Thank you.
Give me the towel, Dad.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.681
No. No. No.
You give me
that towel, Dad.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.349
Give me the towel.
(grunts)

06:24.351 --> 06:25.650
Fine!
(shouts)

06:25.652 --> 06:28.887
(thump)
Ooh, my head!

06:28.889 --> 06:30.389
Dad, are you okay?

06:30.391 --> 06:33.458
Ooh. He need towel.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.769
I can't believe
the emergency room

06:43.771 --> 06:45.871
took all those
other people before me.

06:45.873 --> 06:49.775
Dad, a cable car
tipped over.

06:49.777 --> 06:52.544
People lost limbs.
You got two stitches.

06:52.546 --> 06:55.680
Still, I signed in first.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.016
(knocking)

06:58.018 --> 06:59.684
Hey, I got your text.
Hey.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.253
David, how are you feeling?

07:01.255 --> 07:04.923
I feel like "shut up
and give me my painkillers."

07:04.925 --> 07:07.025
Here, here. My goodness.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.593
CRAWFORD:
Here, David,

07:08.595 --> 07:10.695
wash it down with this.
Uh, no.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.764
No, no, no. No, no, Dad.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.599
You're not supposed to
drink alcohol with... Okay.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.867
Oh.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.402
Now, I find if you do

07:17.404 --> 07:19.638
everything the prescription
label says not to,

07:19.640 --> 07:21.740
it works better.
(chuckles)

07:21.742 --> 07:25.076
Double the "don't"s,
triple the buzz.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.211
(doorbell rings)

07:31.317 --> 07:32.484
Eli Sachs?

07:32.486 --> 07:33.885
Yes.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.720
I'm Special Officer Silverton.

07:35.722 --> 07:36.688
Immigration!

07:55.341 --> 07:57.409
Won't you please come in?

07:58.611 --> 08:00.745
Um, I'm sorry,
Officer Silverton.

08:00.747 --> 08:01.947
It's just a little chaotic.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.249
My dad bumped his head; we
spent the night in the E.R.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.484
I know.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.752
When there's an injury involving
an elderly parent,

08:07.754 --> 08:09.020
we're automatically sent

08:09.022 --> 08:11.089
to investigate.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.760
Ma'am.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.971
You'd be surprised
how many children

08:25.973 --> 08:28.440
are driven
to commit acts of violence

08:28.442 --> 08:30.475
against their elderly parents.

08:30.477 --> 08:31.843
What? You think that I did this?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.612
Oh, my gosh, believe me,

08:33.614 --> 08:36.715
if I had wanted to hurt my dad,
he wouldn't even have a head.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.783
(laughter)
Right? Like... (grunting)

08:38.785 --> 08:41.686
(chuckles)

08:41.688 --> 08:43.121
Well, I'm glad I didn't mention

08:43.123 --> 08:45.724
that anything you say
can be used against you.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.827
Because now I'm going
to use that against you.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.696
Whoa, whoa, hey,

08:51.698 --> 08:54.566
you're not going to find
a more caring son than Eli.

08:54.568 --> 08:55.867
Thank you, buddy.
I appreciate that.
Yeah.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.869
Who chained
the refrigerator shut?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.304
Eli, but, uh,

08:59.306 --> 09:01.039
in his defense,

09:01.041 --> 09:03.675
his dad ate all
of his eggs and he was...

09:03.677 --> 09:04.910
Going to cut his head off?

09:04.912 --> 09:05.844
Yeah. No.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.512
No, no,
No.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.314
no, I would never do that.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.382
Dad, tell him.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.816
Man, that whisky pushed

09:11.818 --> 09:14.920
my painkillers into high gear.

09:14.922 --> 09:19.524
You allowed your father
to take narcotics with alcohol?

09:19.526 --> 09:21.426
Oh, come on,
what's the big deal?

09:21.428 --> 09:24.162
My son does that all the time.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.397
(chuckles)

09:25.399 --> 09:26.565
He says it's easier

09:26.567 --> 09:29.100
to have me unconscious
and out of his hair.

09:29.102 --> 09:33.271
(chuckles)

09:33.273 --> 09:34.239
That's crazy.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.674
I love you in my hair.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.677
(laughter)

09:38.679 --> 09:40.178
Yeah, I wish his wife did.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.447
She wants to make
a flamethrower

09:42.449 --> 09:45.784
out of bug spray
and set me on fire.

09:46.852 --> 09:49.087
Okay, that's a threat
of bodily harm.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.624
By law, I have to remove you
from the premises.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.759
What, like, we're
under arrest?

09:54.761 --> 09:57.295
No, I need to remove
your fathers

09:57.297 --> 09:59.464
and relocate them
to a safe place.

09:59.466 --> 10:02.934
Wait, so-so we-we get
to stay here?

10:02.936 --> 10:06.538
Uh, actually,
I don't care what you do.

10:06.540 --> 10:07.806
My job description

10:07.808 --> 10:10.875
is not "scumbag party planner".

10:12.745 --> 10:13.979
Will we get new identities?

10:13.981 --> 10:16.147
I've always wanted to be "Nick".

10:18.985 --> 10:20.919
(door closes)

10:20.921 --> 10:23.254
Well, if he says it's safe.
Well, if you have to.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.123
I mean, laws are laws.
Yeah.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.424
Take them away.
Yes.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.926
Did that just actually happen?
I mean...

10:27.928 --> 10:29.294
Oh, my God!

10:29.296 --> 10:31.463
(laughter)

10:36.102 --> 10:38.470
Let's hang out, man, yeah.
Watch a movie or something.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.472
Edna, why are you hiding?

10:40.474 --> 10:42.240
Eli,

10:42.242 --> 10:44.476
there is a chance
I may not be legal.

10:47.113 --> 10:49.648
Wh-What kind of chance?

10:49.650 --> 10:51.316
100%.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.589
This is crazy.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.357
You just let them
take your dads away?

10:59.359 --> 11:00.925
No, no, no,
we did everything we could.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.695
We said "Hey"...

11:05.131 --> 11:06.598
...and stuff like that.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.932
You don't even know
where they took them.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.001
Sure we do, away.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.471
Yeah, so don't tell us
we don't care.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.140
Warner, he's your father.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.042
Oh, don't get all
"he's your father" on me.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.677
You're the one who threatened
to set him on fire.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.445
You pushed this
into felony territory.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.213
Hey, hey.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.948
This isn't about
whose fault it is, okay?

11:23.950 --> 11:25.750
We all know
whose fault it is.

11:28.387 --> 11:31.022
It's about just once
not hearing my dad's theory

11:31.024 --> 11:33.091
that Sully Sullenberger
crashed his plane on purpose.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.162
Yeah, or my dad's theory
that John F. Kennedy

11:37.164 --> 11:39.230
actually committed suicide.

11:40.566 --> 11:42.167
I just...
I don't understand

11:42.169 --> 11:44.869
how you guys are not
out looking your dads.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.971
I mean, our cat was missing
for half an hour

11:46.973 --> 11:48.740
and you were all over town
looking for it.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.242
Honey, Bootsy was like family.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.644
Wait a minute.

11:52.646 --> 11:54.579
Bootsy ran away?

11:54.581 --> 11:55.747
Y...

11:57.083 --> 11:58.850
But you told me
that she went to live

11:58.852 --> 12:01.486
with a rich lady
in a castle.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.487
It's okay, Eli.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.589
Don't touch me.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.027
Oh...

12:09.029 --> 12:10.095
Oh, my gosh.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.931
What a beautiful
dad-free morning.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.499
Oh, it was
so nice

12:14.501 --> 12:16.668
not to wake up at 5:30 a.m.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.169
with a blast of <i>I Love Lucy,</i>

12:18.171 --> 12:19.704
followed by someone yelling,

12:19.706 --> 12:22.340
"Women aren't funny!"
(Warner laughs)

12:22.342 --> 12:25.877
It's so great not coming home
to a 68-year-old man

12:25.879 --> 12:28.113
stuck in your doggy door.
(laughs)

12:28.115 --> 12:31.416
Wait... so your dads are just
gone and you guys don't care?

12:31.418 --> 12:32.417
Oh, no, no, no, no.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.585
We'll clear all this up

12:33.587 --> 12:35.019
and get 'em back
in a couple of weeks,

12:35.021 --> 12:36.888
or however long it takes
to fill out the one-page form.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.123
Right, yeah.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.424
Well, don't wait too long.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.792
Elder foster care is crazy.

12:40.794 --> 12:41.960
I saw this thing on the news

12:41.962 --> 12:44.028
where they drugged them
and fed them dog food.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.698
Hey, some of that dog food
on TV looks pretty good.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.533
Like that one with
the real chunks of sirloin.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.901
Mmm...

12:49.903 --> 12:51.469
I mean, I know it costs more
than regular dog food,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.538
but I'm worth it.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.407
"Elderly foster
care abuse."

12:56.409 --> 12:58.109
Oh, my God...

12:58.111 --> 12:59.144
Wait, look at these pictures.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.212
Wow, she's right.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.947
Ew.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.150
Oh, gross.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.919
Ew...
Ew!

13:07.921 --> 13:09.988
Oh, no, this lady's got
a smile on her face.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.556
Wait, that's
not her face.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.159
<i>Ew!</i>

13:14.161 --> 13:15.927
Oh, my God.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.930
Hey, what if...
some sadistic monster

13:18.932 --> 13:21.065
is torturing
our dads right now?

13:21.067 --> 13:24.169
¶ So welcome to our happy home

13:24.171 --> 13:26.004
¶ I am Ben
¶ And I am Joan

13:26.006 --> 13:28.339
¶ Your children beat you
black and blue ¶

13:28.341 --> 13:31.176
¶ With a book
or with a shoe... ¶

13:31.178 --> 13:32.443
We get it!
Yeah.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.712
We get it,
you're nice people.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.448
Welcome home.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.184
Oh. (chuckles)

13:39.186 --> 13:40.185
This is great.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.953
The only time
I get hugged at home

13:41.955 --> 13:44.823
is when they're pushing
my hernia back in.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.291
Ah, ah!

13:46.293 --> 13:47.192
Just the woman.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.560
Oh!
Uh, yeah, right.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.631
Hey, Donny and Marie,
where's the bathroom?

13:53.633 --> 13:56.067
Oh! Tinkle Center
is right over here.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.774
Wow!

14:02.776 --> 14:04.709
That's the Royal
Flush 3000.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.611
Well, then,

14:06.613 --> 14:09.547
you've got quite
the fecal eye, mister.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.016
You could put a loaf
of French bread
down that thing

14:12.018 --> 14:14.519
and find it bobbing in
the ocean, not even bent.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.321
Mm-hmm.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.122
Mind if I take
her for a spin?

14:18.124 --> 14:20.525
Oh, sure.
Just-just don't flush it
while you're still on it.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.127
It'll suck
your heart out.

14:23.129 --> 14:24.729
It already has.

14:31.136 --> 14:33.037
You know,
I once made the mistake

14:33.039 --> 14:34.138
of telling a talking parrot

14:34.140 --> 14:37.075
my credit card number.

14:37.077 --> 14:40.144
$8,000 and
two court cases later,

14:40.146 --> 14:42.213
I have a newfound respect
for the animal kingdom.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.849
Yeah.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.985
You know, animals
instinctively want
to entertain us.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.087
That's why bears
love riding bicycles

14:49.089 --> 14:50.555
while being whipped.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.156
Hmm?

14:52.158 --> 14:53.424
Well, you're a hoot.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.927
Yeah...
you guys sure are,

14:55.929 --> 14:57.195
and I gotta tell you,

14:57.197 --> 14:58.229
"hoot" is the highest
compliment we give.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.564
It's true.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.432
I've only met three hoots
in my entire life,

15:01.434 --> 15:03.167
and I'm looking
at two of 'em.

15:04.503 --> 15:07.205
Well, uh, excuse me,
where are your, uh, coasters?

15:07.207 --> 15:08.406
Coasters?

15:08.408 --> 15:12.944
You are an enormous
silly goose, mister.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.179
You just put your drink
wherever you want.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.114
Really?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.582
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)

15:17.584 --> 15:19.083
(chuckling)

15:19.085 --> 15:20.418
Hah.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.720
See, we like having
rings on our furniture.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.956
It reminds us of all
the nice older people

15:24.958 --> 15:26.758
we've had the privilege
of sheltering.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.692
Huh.
Mm-hmm.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.093
This was Gus.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.128
His daughter hit him
over the head

15:30.130 --> 15:31.796
with a snow shovel.

15:31.798 --> 15:34.065
He sure hated Christmas.
(giggles)

15:34.067 --> 15:35.366
All right,
this is Earl.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.369
Earl's daughter
water-boarded him.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.804
That's horrible.

15:39.806 --> 15:43.174
Well, they actually got
some pretty useful information.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.612
All right, California
has so many weird town names.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.713
I know!

15:48.715 --> 15:50.448
"Vista del Negro."

15:50.450 --> 15:52.517
Can they even have that sign?

15:53.485 --> 15:54.786
How much further away is it?

15:54.788 --> 15:58.056
The, uh, the Find-a-Phone app
says five miles.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.925
I-I can't get some
of those abuse images
out of my head.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.327
Ugh, right?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.394
Especially that one
with the, uh...

16:03.396 --> 16:04.295
Yeah.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.830
Or-or the ones with, uh...

16:05.832 --> 16:07.098
Oh, God, don't remind me.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.266
How about that one with...

16:08.268 --> 16:09.167
No, I didn't
see that one.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.836
I didn't see that one.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.738
Nobody better be sewing
our dads together

16:13.740 --> 16:15.740
to make a human centipede.

16:15.742 --> 16:19.110
Actually, you need three
to make a human centipede.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.146
Oh, you're right.
I'm so embarrassed.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.248
Well, I am never gonna fight
with my dad again.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.750
He can even walk in
on me having sex

16:25.752 --> 16:27.418
and I'm not gonna
yell at him to leave.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.187
Really?

16:29.189 --> 16:32.323
You're going to let
your dad watch
you having sex?

16:32.325 --> 16:34.292
Well, he never came to
my Little League games.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.828
It's kind of the same thing.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.663
Not really.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.833
Well, the point is,

16:41.835 --> 16:44.769
we are going to be the most
loving and tolerant sons ever.

16:44.771 --> 16:45.837
Hear, hear.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.307
We're never gonna
be like that.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.208
No, no.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.176
But even us just
talking about it

16:52.178 --> 16:54.278
makes us the most
awesome sons ever.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.546
Hear, hear.
Yeah.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.615
No, no, no, no.
Turn off here, here.
Oh.

17:00.285 --> 17:01.486
<i>Rocky.</i>
<i>Black Swan.</i>

17:01.488 --> 17:03.154
<i>Rocky 2.</i>
<i>All That Jazz.</i>

17:03.156 --> 17:04.555
<i>Rocky 3.</i>
<i>Footloose!</i>

17:04.557 --> 17:06.290
CRAWFORD:
Uh, <i>The Last</i>
<i>Temptation of Christ.</i>

17:06.292 --> 17:07.658
<i>Ice Castles!</i>

17:07.660 --> 17:09.327
Yes, <i>Ice Castles! </i>
<i>Yes!</i>

17:09.329 --> 17:10.328
Yes, yes!
Oh, you got it!
Yes!

17:10.330 --> 17:11.329
You're so good.
No, you're the good one.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.330
Good.
You're the good one!

17:12.332 --> 17:13.731
I know.
You're the good one.

17:13.733 --> 17:14.866
Uh, who's next?

17:14.868 --> 17:16.200
All right, David,
you are up.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.301
David!
CRAWFORD:
Go, David.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.503
(whoops)
Come on, David,
come on.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.570
Come on.
Here we go.

17:19.572 --> 17:20.838
All right.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.974
<i>Apollo 13.</i>
<i>CRAWFORD:</i>
<i>No.</i>

17:22.976 --> 17:24.642
Okay.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.710
Again, you're not
supposed to just

17:25.712 --> 17:27.011
say the title out
loud, but you...

17:27.013 --> 17:29.313
You know, I'm gonna give
you a point anyway

17:29.315 --> 17:32.316
'cause this time,
you didn't just
throw it into the fire.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.351
What can I say?

17:33.353 --> 17:35.420
I'm having fun.
(laughing)

17:35.422 --> 17:38.256
All right, you sickos,
get away from our dads!

17:38.258 --> 17:40.892
Warner, check to see they
haven't been sewn together.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.862
Oh, I can... I can kind of
see that they haven't.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.331
David, Crawford,
stand behind me.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.833
I will protect you

17:48.835 --> 17:50.902
like a panty shield
of righteousness.

17:52.438 --> 17:55.073
And I have put a a fresh pea
in my rape whistle,

17:55.075 --> 17:56.574
so it'll be good and loud,

17:56.576 --> 17:58.543
I guarantee you that.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.544
It's okay.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.745
Yeah.
We got this.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.513
What are you doing here, Eli?

18:02.515 --> 18:03.614
Dad, listen...

18:03.616 --> 18:05.516
I'm sorry that we fought before.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.352
You mean more to me
than most of my towels.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.288
WARNER:
And Dad,

18:10.290 --> 18:12.190
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.758
It's just, Camila and I
worry so much

18:13.760 --> 18:15.593
that you're gonna
destroy our home,

18:15.595 --> 18:17.428
business, and children,
that we, uh...

18:17.430 --> 18:19.831
we-we overreact.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.600
So come on, we're taking
you guys out of here.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.268
We'll sort it out with
Social Services
in the morning.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.437
Let's go.
No, thanks.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.038
What do you mean?

18:27.040 --> 18:28.372
We like it here.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.575
And we are no longer
a burden to you.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.877
Wait...
come on.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.378
This isn't about
your happiness.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.214
This is about our
guilty conscience.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.815
So let's go.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.984
They haven't even met
their roommates.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.285
They're a couple of hoots.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.787
Now you're up to four hoots

18:42.789 --> 18:44.222
and you've lost my trust.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.457
Wait a minute.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.425
What roommates?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.860
Us.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.363
Who the hell are they?

18:53.565 --> 18:54.899
Our mothers.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.501
I'll take Country Club,

18:56.503 --> 18:58.336
you take Bowling Alley.

18:59.638 --> 19:00.771
Yeah.

19:00.773 --> 19:04.408
They moved in a year ago
for "just a few days."

19:04.410 --> 19:06.010
Wait a minute.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.679
You're trying to fix up
our dads with your moms?

19:08.681 --> 19:09.947
We need someone
to marry them

19:09.949 --> 19:11.482
to get them out
of our house.
Yeah.

19:12.351 --> 19:13.684
Come on, let's get
out of here.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.320
Hey, not so fast.

19:16.322 --> 19:20.258
My secret garden
needs tending.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.464
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

19:26.466 --> 19:27.798
Dad, Dad, Dad.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.300
You can stop saying that.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.170
We've been driving
for a half hour.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.006
I'm sorry, I'm just
so full of adrenaline.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.808
Yeah, I can't believe
you hit that woman.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.610
Yeah. (laughs)

19:39.612 --> 19:41.679
I feel like Sean Connery.

19:45.484 --> 19:48.753
I'm still not sure
that was a woman.

19:59.231 --> 20:00.998
Excuse me,
I'm here...

20:01.000 --> 20:02.533
Hang on, I'm not
done with this story

20:02.535 --> 20:04.435
about Kelly Clarkson
finding true love.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.872
Aw...

20:07.874 --> 20:09.207
Oh, my God.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.309
Why didn't you say
you were hot?

20:11.311 --> 20:13.377
I'm just here to inspect
your fire extinguisher.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.812
Oh, I better help you.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.714
It's really hard to find.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.883
There it is.
Hmm?

20:20.886 --> 20:25.389
Uh... yeah, that...
that might be it.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.857
All you guys
are so brave.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.193
I-I have a cousin
who's a fire fighter
in Vista Del Negro.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.429
Oh, well, I love
Vista Del Negro.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.664
I live one town over
in Yorba Vulva.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.203
We're back!
(whoops)

20:39.205 --> 20:40.338
(whoops)
Operation:
Rescue Dads

20:40.340 --> 20:41.672
From Nice People
With Creepy Moms

20:41.674 --> 20:44.342
was a huge success!

20:44.344 --> 20:46.611
So you guys enjoying
having your dads back?

20:46.613 --> 20:48.045
Yeah.
And the neighbors missed

20:48.047 --> 20:49.847
my dad's robe blowing open

20:49.849 --> 20:52.016
when he gets the paper.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.684
Yeah, my dad flooded
the bathroom this morning

20:53.686 --> 20:55.553
trying to flush
a loaf of French bread

20:55.555 --> 20:56.787
down the toilet.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.456
He just kept flushing
and yelling,

20:58.458 --> 21:00.658
"You can do it!
You can do it!"

21:02.794 --> 21:04.862
(Edna speaking Spanish)
Speak of the devil.

21:06.598 --> 21:07.598
Hey.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.767
Hey, hey!
What's going on?

21:09.769 --> 21:13.371
Mr. Eli, your father won't
let me watch my favorite show:

21:13.373 --> 21:16.474
<i>The Real Housewives</i>
<i>of Guadalajara.</i>

21:16.476 --> 21:19.477
I want to watch
<i>Homeland.</i>

21:19.479 --> 21:20.978
EDNA :
Always same!

21:20.980 --> 21:23.481
"I crazy, I crazy..."

21:23.483 --> 21:26.250
Ka-boom!

21:26.252 --> 21:28.085
Guys, we live in the future.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.620
We can DVR both shows.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.822
What?
<i>¿Que?</i>

21:31.824 --> 21:33.491
FIREMAN:
Okay...

21:34.293 --> 21:36.727
<i>Inmagracion!</i>

21:39.998 --> 21:42.700
(grunting)

21:47.506 --> 21:50.574
They never take Edna alive!

21:53.512 --> 21:56.414
