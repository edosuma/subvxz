00:44.480 --> 00:48.000
Well, she's gone now.
Oh, that's a shame.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.200
Nothing for me, Mr Carson?

00:53.235 --> 00:54.880
No, Anna.

00:55.760 --> 00:59.400
Once again, I'm afraid,
there's nothing for you.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.880
Come on.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.965
I've enough on my plate
without going into details.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.805
You're co-owner of this estate.
You have to get into detail.

01:39.840 --> 01:44.560
Not to challenge Robert, surely? No,
but you have to pull your weight.

01:44.595 --> 01:46.520
That's all I'm saying.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.560
How is Bates? I've not seen him
for a while, sir.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.005
Oh? Why's that?

01:54.040 --> 01:57.520
I'm not quite sure, sir.
They've stopped his visitors.

01:57.555 --> 01:59.925
Has he given you a reason?

01:59.960 --> 02:03.165
He's not written
in quite some time now.

02:03.200 --> 02:08.160
And you don't know why? No, but
I'm certain I will before too long.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.640
Mrs Crawley, how may I help?

02:16.880 --> 02:18.965
I'm sorry to push in on you again.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.040
I didn't have time
to come down before dinner

02:22.075 --> 02:24.600
and now we're on our way home.
Oh.

02:29.120 --> 02:32.880
Mrs Hughes, you know
I went to see Ethel Parks?

02:32.915 --> 02:36.000
I do, ma'am. She wouldn't
speak to me then

02:36.035 --> 02:38.605
but she has since sought me out

02:38.640 --> 02:41.240
and asked me to deliver
this letter to you.

02:41.275 --> 02:45.045
When we last spoke of her,

02:45.080 --> 02:48.285
you seemed to think
she'd fallen into bad ways.

02:48.320 --> 02:52.240
I'm afraid that's the case.
She's been working as a prostitute.

02:55.240 --> 03:00.560
My, my. That's not a word you hear
in this house every day. No.

03:00.595 --> 03:04.285
But I think it also shows
the measure of her misery.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.180
Ethel has been driven into this,
of that I have no doubt.

03:08.215 --> 03:12.040
If only she would allow me
to help her, but she won't.

03:12.920 --> 03:18.520
If this letter can give a clue as to
how I may help, please let me know.

03:18.555 --> 03:20.200
I will, ma'am.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.965
Your sentiments do you credit,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.480
but I suspect
she will be too ashamed

03:27.515 --> 03:29.880
to face how far she's fallen.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.720
Good night.
Good night, Mrs Crawley.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.320
So, am I to answer to you both?
Of course not.

03:43.355 --> 03:45.805
What Lord Grantham means

03:45.840 --> 03:49.920
is that I've made an investment
in the estate. That is all.

03:49.955 --> 03:52.937
Otherwise, nothing has changed.
Very good.

03:52.972 --> 03:55.920
Can we bring the staff
back up to snuff?

03:55.955 --> 03:58.645
I believe we can.

03:58.680 --> 04:02.760
Mrs Hughes is short of a house maid,
Mrs Patmore wants a kitchen maid

04:02.795 --> 04:06.280
and I need a new footman.
Do you really?

04:06.315 --> 04:08.565
I sometimes feel the world

04:08.600 --> 04:11.085
is different than it was
before the War.

04:11.120 --> 04:15.285
I would like to return
to my duties as a butler, sir,

04:15.320 --> 04:20.440
but if you prefer I continue to do
the work of a second footman

04:20.475 --> 04:23.685
in addition... Mr Crawley does not
mean that, do you?

04:23.720 --> 04:27.800
Certainly not. That is good news.
It's too late to get into shape

04:27.835 --> 04:30.605
before the dinner
for the Archbishop of York,

04:30.640 --> 04:33.720
but it'll be the last time
you'll have to fudge it.

04:33.755 --> 04:36.800
I'll do my best with an added
spring in my step.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.285
Why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Because I'm not married.

04:42.320 --> 04:47.320
Yes, but now that... The others are,
what difference would it make?

04:47.355 --> 04:50.445
You know what I mean.
I prefer to be up and about.

04:50.480 --> 04:54.580
Tennessee is going to
ratify the 19th Amendment. Meaning?

04:54.615 --> 04:58.680
All US women will have the vote.
Which is more than here.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.605
They almost do.

05:00.640 --> 05:05.000
I don't have the vote. I'm not over
30 and I'm not a householder.

05:05.035 --> 05:07.440
It's ridiculous. You should write
to the Times.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.485
Maybe I will.

05:09.520 --> 05:13.120
Ask your mother if she needs
any help with tonight's dinner.

05:13.155 --> 05:16.720
There's nothing so toffee-nosed
as a prince of the Church.

05:16.755 --> 05:19.800
Put him next to your grandmother.
She'll handle him.

05:35.160 --> 05:40.040
Oh, Anna. You'll be happy to hear as
soon as we take on a new house maid

05:40.075 --> 05:42.560
you'll be a lady's maid
to Lady Mary at last.

05:42.595 --> 05:45.160
That's nice, Mr Carson. Thank you.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.520
I thought you'd be more pleased.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.005
No, I am pleased, really I am.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.140
I've just got a lot on my mind.
Sorry.

05:53.175 --> 05:56.205
I've also advertised
for a new footman.

05:56.240 --> 06:00.800
He'll be second footman, won't he?
As to that, I will not pronounce

06:00.835 --> 06:04.760
at this stage. Try to find a man
with something about him.

06:04.795 --> 06:08.337
I want the house
to be properly represented.

06:08.372 --> 06:12.106
Is that aimed at me?
If the cap fits, wear it.

06:12.141 --> 06:15.840
You're very quiet.
You'll never guess what.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.960
I've had a letter from Ethel.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.160
She wants to meet me,
but she won't come here.

06:23.195 --> 06:25.845
What for? And why not?

06:25.880 --> 06:29.480
She'd be uncomfortable.
Why, particularly?

06:30.680 --> 06:32.520
Never you mind.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.520
I think I'll ask Mrs Crawley
if we can meet there.

06:36.555 --> 06:39.640
Heaven knows what Ethel
wants of us this time.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.925
Cora said you were looking for me.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.320
I've stolen the nursery
as a sitting room.

06:46.355 --> 06:48.680
This is the paper,
unless you hate it.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.400
Oh.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.925
Is that all?

06:53.960 --> 06:55.920
Why? What did you think it was?

06:57.640 --> 07:00.360
Cora said you'd been
to the doctor earlier.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.885
I wondered why.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.960
To find something for my hay fever.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.920
What will we use for a day nursery
should the need arise?

07:13.640 --> 07:15.760
I think we can worry about that

07:15.795 --> 07:17.880
a little further down the line.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.880
Oh, thank you, my dear,
that's very kind.

07:23.915 --> 07:26.800
How much do I owe you? A guinea.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.445
A guinea?

07:29.480 --> 07:31.565
For a bottle of scent?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.800
Did he have a mask and a gun?

07:35.640 --> 07:39.920
How are you? All right, I suppose.

07:39.955 --> 07:42.005
I worry about you.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.205
That sort of thing is so horrid.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.680
Being jilted at the alter?
Yes, it is horrid,

07:47.440 --> 07:50.720
multiplied by about
ten thousand million. Well...

07:50.755 --> 07:53.005
You must keep busy.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.600
What with? There's nothing
to do at the house,

07:56.635 --> 07:58.765
except when we entertain.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.880
There must be something
you can put your mind to. Like what?

08:02.915 --> 08:07.317
Gardening? No, you can't be
as desperate as that.

08:07.352 --> 08:11.720
Then what? Edith, dear,
you're a woman with a brain

08:11.755 --> 08:14.125
and reasonable ability.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.480
Stop whining
and find something to do.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.960
I'm going out, Anna.
I've told Mrs Patmore.

08:31.995 --> 08:35.080
I think everything's
under control for tonight.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.679
What's the matter? Nothing.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.440
Except...

08:45.640 --> 08:49.000
I haven't had a letter
from Mr Bates in weeks.

08:50.600 --> 08:54.920
I worry... I worry
that he's being gallant

08:54.955 --> 08:56.965
and trying to set me free,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.040
that he wants me to make a new life
without him.

09:00.075 --> 09:01.920
I doubt it very much.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.960
Then why would he be silent
like this and stop me visiting?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.565
Obviously, I don't know why,

09:10.600 --> 09:13.280
but I do know there'd be
a good reason.

09:13.315 --> 09:15.400
Do you really think so?

09:16.600 --> 09:18.320
I'd swear to it.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.240
They know you tricked them.
Who knows what?

09:35.440 --> 09:37.960
Mr Durrant's a dealer
on the outside.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.965
What's that to do with me?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.085
He's working for your cellmate.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.925
You punched Craig
so they set you up,

09:49.960 --> 09:53.160
but you hid the stuff,
turned the tables on them.

09:53.195 --> 09:55.240
Now they're angry.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.440
And what can they do?
Tell you what they can start doing.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.680
Durrant reported you
to the governor for violence.

10:13.715 --> 10:16.165
You're officially
a dangerous prisoner.

10:16.200 --> 10:21.160
The governor won't fall for that.
When's the last time your wife came?

10:21.195 --> 10:23.720
How many letters
have you received lately?

10:29.880 --> 10:32.920
Thank God. What a relief.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.565
I thought she'd given up on me.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.160
Don't thank God till you know
what else is in store.

10:39.195 --> 10:41.000
Stop talking!

10:48.360 --> 10:50.205
Go on, then.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.180
Tea spoon, egg spoon, melon spoon,

10:53.215 --> 10:56.120
grapefruit spoon, jam spoon,...

11:00.760 --> 11:02.720
Shall I tell you?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.800
All right.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.325
The bouillon spoon.

11:10.360 --> 11:14.400
I thought soup spoons were the
same as table spoons? So they are,

11:14.435 --> 11:18.120
but not for bouillon, which is drunk
from a smaller dish.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.200
Off you go now, I must get on.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.880
You're taking a lot of trouble
with Alfred.

11:29.915 --> 11:31.765
I feel quite jealous.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.480
I don't know why. He asked for help.

11:34.515 --> 11:36.480
You never did.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.285
It's very hard to begin.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.440
Well, find a way,
we all have lives to lead.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.965
Could you write to the Bryants

11:52.000 --> 11:53.960
to say I want them to have Charlie?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.520
We've already been down this path

11:57.555 --> 11:59.805
to no avail. I know.

11:59.840 --> 12:03.840
and I know I said a mother's love was
worth more than they had to give,

12:03.875 --> 12:06.205
but I said it for me, not for him.

12:06.240 --> 12:10.220
My dear, you mustn't do anything
until you're absolutely sure.

12:10.255 --> 12:14.200
Mrs Hughes said we all have lives
to lead, but that isn't true.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.080
I've got no life.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.925
I exist, but barely. We know
the route you've taken.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.840
It's good of you to have me here.
I work with others like you

12:26.875 --> 12:29.205
to rebuild their lives.
Can't we work together

12:29.240 --> 12:33.180
to find a way for you to keep
your son? With his grandparents,

12:33.215 --> 12:37.120
Charlie can build a life that
is whatever he wishes it to be.

12:37.155 --> 12:40.360
You and I working together
could never offer him that.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.485
You want me to write to them again.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.320
But leave it vague.
Say Ethel would like them

12:47.355 --> 12:49.960
to keep in contact with their son.

12:50.840 --> 12:55.800
I won't change my mind.
Nevertheless, that's what I'll do

12:55.835 --> 12:57.925
then they'll be no disappointment.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.600
If you'll forgive me,
we've a big dinner tonight.

13:00.635 --> 13:03.200
Good day, ma'am. Ethel.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.480
Ethel has had a very hard time
of it since she left us.

13:10.515 --> 13:12.920
She's had great difficulty
making ends meet.

13:12.955 --> 13:15.120
We know how she solved that problem.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.240
Give my regards to Mr Molesley.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.760
Until we meet again, my dear.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.780
I had a coat.

13:24.815 --> 13:26.965
It's there.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.240
You will help Miss Parks.
Please, Mrs Bird.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.560
Some manners wouldn't go amiss.

13:46.880 --> 13:51.320
I do not believe it's part of my
duties to wait on the likes of her.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.680
I'm sorry, but that's what I feel.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.965
I don't want to sound anti-Catholic.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.920
Why not? I am.
Not in any real way, I'm sure.

14:09.955 --> 14:12.365
I don't want thumb screws
or the rack

14:12.400 --> 14:16.120
but there's something
of Johnny Foreigner about them.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.060
I've no time to talk
but tell them I'm all right.

14:39.095 --> 14:42.360
I'm out of the flat,
they haven't stopped me.

14:42.395 --> 14:44.160
Who hasn't stopped you?

14:44.195 --> 14:45.897
Sybil?

14:45.932 --> 14:47.600
'Hello?'

15:07.560 --> 15:11.680
What's wrong? I've just had the most
peculiar conversation with Sybil.

15:11.715 --> 15:15.085
She kept on about being
out of the flat

15:15.120 --> 15:20.000
and nobody had stopped her and...
Stopped her from doing what?

15:20.035 --> 15:23.840
I don't know. She suddenly
put down the telephone.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.080
Dinner is served, My Lady.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.885
Do you find the War
has driven the people

15:34.920 --> 15:38.525
back into the churches
or further away than ever?

15:38.560 --> 15:43.800
Behold,
I stand at the door and knock.

15:43.835 --> 15:47.400
Someone sounds very angry.
Or very wet. Or both.

15:53.200 --> 15:57.200
Do you any have luggage, sir? I
barely have the clothes I stand in.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.840
Where are they? They're in the...

16:03.875 --> 16:06.677
Tom! What's happened? Where's Sybil?

16:06.712 --> 16:09.445
I had to get away,
leave her to follow.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.840
I made arrangements.
She'll be on her way now.

16:12.875 --> 16:16.200
Why are you here?
Why must she follow you alone?

16:16.235 --> 16:18.085
I can explain.

16:18.120 --> 16:22.280
There's a dinner going on but I'll
tell them you're here. No, don't.

16:25.480 --> 16:29.960
No-one must know. I'll tell you
it all when they're gone.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.680
What's the matter?

16:32.715 --> 16:34.445
Tom!

16:34.480 --> 16:39.040
Get some dry clothes of Matthew's.
I'll come when the coast is clear.

16:42.280 --> 16:47.000
Would you ask Mrs Hughes to sort
some food out for him? Yes, My Lady.

16:48.680 --> 16:52.840
An idiotic man delivering a village
pamphlet. Can you imagine,

16:52.875 --> 16:55.120
in this weather,
at this time of night?

16:57.680 --> 16:59.800
It's Branson. He wouldn't come in.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.245
Why not?

17:03.280 --> 17:05.119
Is Sybil with him?

17:05.599 --> 17:09.640
What's going on? She's not here
but apparently she's coming soon.

17:09.675 --> 17:12.925
He'll explain
when our guest has gone.

17:12.960 --> 17:18.079
Something to look forward to.
Other men have normal sons-in-law

17:18.115 --> 17:21.200
who farm or preach or serve
their country.

17:21.234 --> 17:23.845
No family is ever what it seems.

17:23.880 --> 17:27.839
Do you think he's on the run
from the police? Don't be daft.

17:27.875 --> 17:31.057
He hadn't the money for a taxi
from the station.

17:31.092 --> 17:34.240
Maybe he fancied the walk.
Yes, he probably loves

17:34.275 --> 17:36.965
a night walk in the pouring rain.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.040
What room is he in?
I'll take that, thank you.

17:45.280 --> 17:49.000
So there'll be no more gossip
on that subject tonight.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.005
They turned everyone
out of the castle,

17:52.040 --> 17:55.480
Lord and Lady Drungore,
their sons and servants,

17:55.515 --> 17:58.120
and then they set fire to it.

17:59.320 --> 18:02.565
What a tragedy. Well, yes and no.

18:02.600 --> 18:07.320
That house was hideous,
but of course, that is no excuse.

18:07.355 --> 18:10.245
No, it is not.
What was your involvement?

18:10.280 --> 18:14.520
Who says I was involved? You know
a lot about it if you weren't.

18:14.555 --> 18:18.445
Why are you running away?
And what's Sybil's part in this?

18:18.480 --> 18:23.680
She's not involved. They think I was
part of it, one of the instigators.

18:23.715 --> 18:26.837
The police are looking for you?
I couldn't go home.

18:26.872 --> 18:29.936
If they took me,
I wouldn't get a fair hearing.

18:29.971 --> 18:33.005
You gave them Sybil
while you saved yourself?

18:33.040 --> 18:36.005
I don't think they'll hold her,
but if they do,

18:36.040 --> 18:40.040
I'm ready to go back and face
the consequences. You'd better be.

18:40.075 --> 18:44.077
You must see the Home Secretary.
And say what? The police say

18:44.112 --> 18:48.080
he was there, he says he wasn't.
I didn't say I wasn't there.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.045
Why were you?

18:51.080 --> 18:54.720
For the fun of seeing
private property destroyed?

18:54.755 --> 18:57.365
Those places are different for me.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.440
I don't see charm
and gracious living.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.005
I see something horrible.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.920
It's a jungle castle,
I rather agree. Mama,

19:05.955 --> 19:08.800
you are not helping.
But when I saw them

19:08.835 --> 19:11.645
standing there with their children,

19:11.680 --> 19:14.720
all of them in tears
watching their home burn,

19:15.840 --> 19:18.400
I was sorry. I admit it.

19:18.840 --> 19:22.880
I don't want their type to govern
Ireland, I want a free state,

19:22.915 --> 19:25.120
but I was sorry.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.920
Never mind that.
What's happened to Sybil?

19:28.955 --> 19:31.417
We agreed that
I should leave at once

19:31.452 --> 19:33.845
and that she'd close the flat
and follow.

19:33.880 --> 19:38.240
I got the last boat so she won't
be here before tomorrow. Good God!

19:38.275 --> 19:42.245
You abandon a pregnant woman
in a land that's not her own

19:42.280 --> 19:46.860
while you run for it?! You have
to go to London, for Sybil's sake.

19:46.895 --> 19:51.440
You have to see Mr Short. I don't
have to do anything! I... Go to bed!

19:51.475 --> 19:53.760
I'll give you my answer
in the morning.

20:28.400 --> 20:32.560
Of course, she married beneath her.
Says the Habsburg Archduke!

20:32.595 --> 20:34.925
What if he has to go to prison?
What then?

20:34.960 --> 20:38.080
That's enough of that, thank you,
Miss O'Brien.

20:38.115 --> 20:39.920
Bedtime, I think.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.020
I'm going up. Good night.

20:49.055 --> 20:51.205
I'll try to keep them quiet,

20:51.240 --> 20:53.700
but to be honest,
I knew it would happen.

20:53.735 --> 20:56.125
I knew he'd bring shame
on this house.

20:56.160 --> 20:59.165
It sounds as if he's on the run
from the police

20:59.200 --> 21:03.040
and that Lady Sybil is languishing
in a dungeon in Dublin.

21:03.520 --> 21:07.520
Let's wait and see
what the morning brings.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.125
What in God's name is it?

21:11.160 --> 21:15.285
An electric toaster. I've given it
to myself as a treat.

21:15.320 --> 21:20.240
If it's any good, I'll suggest one
for the upstairs breakfasts.

21:20.275 --> 21:25.160
Is it not enough that we're
sheltering a dangerous revolutionary?

21:25.640 --> 21:28.080
Could you not have spared me that?

21:39.960 --> 21:42.120
You've always had that.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.960
Hello.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.720
Can we help you?
I'm here to see Mr Carson.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.925
Who's this?

21:54.960 --> 21:57.085
Jimmy Kent, at your service.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.525
I'm Mr Barrow, His Lordship's valet.

21:59.560 --> 22:02.020
I'm hoping to be
His Lordship's footman,

22:02.055 --> 22:04.445
which is why
I'm looking for Mr Carson.

22:04.480 --> 22:08.520
What's the matter? Have you all been
turned into pillars of salt?

22:10.040 --> 22:12.960
May I help? I've come
for the interview.

22:12.995 --> 22:14.685
I see.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.120
Well, if you'll wait there.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.560
I want to make it clear that whatever
I do, it's for Sybil and not you.

22:28.595 --> 22:32.325
I find your actions despicable,
whatever your beliefs.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.940
You speak of Ireland suffering,
and I don't contradict you,

22:35.975 --> 22:39.485
but Ireland cannot prosper
until this savagery is put away.

22:39.520 --> 22:43.780
Yes, but you must keep Tom out
of prison. I'll go to London today.

22:43.815 --> 22:48.347
I'll arrange an interview. I won't
come home till I've seen Short.

22:48.382 --> 22:52.880
Thank you. I know it's right. For
him. And for Sybil and this family.

22:52.915 --> 22:57.325
I suppose so. Let me know
if Sybil gets in touch.

22:57.360 --> 23:01.160
She won't. She won't give them
anything to trace her by.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.040
What a harsh world you live in.

23:04.240 --> 23:08.560
We all live in a harsh world,
but at least I know I do.

23:15.840 --> 23:19.660
I see you've been working for
the Dowager, Lady Anstruther.

23:19.695 --> 23:23.480
Yes, but she's closed up the house
and gone to live in France.

23:23.515 --> 23:26.965
She begged me to go with her
but I didn't fancy it.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.880
I didn't think I'd like the food.
She begged you, did she?

23:30.915 --> 23:33.000
You know what women can be like.

23:33.960 --> 23:37.440
Not, I suspect, as well as you do.

23:44.935 --> 23:47.165
Is it safe?

23:47.200 --> 23:49.760
Right, Charlie,
let's put your hat on.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.760
Make you look nice and smart.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.720
Be a good boy for Mummy, yeah?
Yeah.

23:57.080 --> 23:58.840
Come on.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.165
Thank you for letting us come.

24:04.200 --> 24:08.200
Why have we come? To hear more guff
about a mother's love? Mr Bryant,

24:08.235 --> 24:10.405
that's not fair. Isn't it?

24:10.440 --> 24:12.620
We know what you are now, Ethel.

24:12.655 --> 24:14.765
We know how far you've fallen.

24:14.800 --> 24:19.500
I didn't want Mrs Bryant to be in
the same room as you. He means...

24:19.535 --> 24:24.200
How do you know? It's not hard
to find out about a woman like you.

24:24.235 --> 24:28.360
I could give you a list
of your clients.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.085
You've had me followed?

24:31.120 --> 24:34.840
Didn't you think we'd keep
a check on our grandson?

24:34.875 --> 24:38.200
We're not judging you.
I'm judging her.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.640
I judge her and I find her wanting.

24:44.120 --> 24:47.680
Ethel, we've decided
to offer you some money,

24:49.000 --> 24:52.080
to make things easier
so you won't have to...

24:52.115 --> 24:54.400
Unless you don't want to give it up.

24:54.800 --> 24:58.720
Well, that's very generous,
isn't it, Ethel?

25:00.120 --> 25:02.720
It throws a different light
on things.

25:05.920 --> 25:09.240
Oh, there's Mrs Bird with the tea.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.840
Would you like to help me, Ethel?

25:17.560 --> 25:21.560
Look what I've got for you.
A teddy. That's right.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.765
Should I not take it in, then?

25:29.800 --> 25:33.080
I can do that.
I'm sure I don't need your help.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.680
Thank you, Mrs Bird.

25:44.240 --> 25:47.320
Ethel, you don't have to do this.

25:48.120 --> 25:52.440
You have a choice. You mean I should
take money from that man?

25:52.475 --> 25:56.125
It won't be much.
Enough to keep us from starving.

25:56.160 --> 26:00.160
Even if Charlie doesn't go
to a famous school or university,

26:00.195 --> 26:02.160
you'll be there to give him love.

26:03.360 --> 26:07.640
Yeah. I suppose Mr Crawley went
to a famous school and university.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.240
I see.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.800
Thank you, Mrs Crawley.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.840
When do you want it to happen?
Tomorrow night.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.200
Want Mr Durrant? No.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.165
Not him.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.960
Tell Turner, he's straight.
Don't tell him till the afternoon.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.960
Why are you doing this?

26:45.840 --> 26:47.800
Why are you helping me?

26:48.280 --> 26:50.400
I can't stand Craig.

26:58.840 --> 27:01.040
You do that very neatly, my dear.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.400
I was trained by Mrs Hughes.

27:04.435 --> 27:06.525
She was a good worker,

27:06.560 --> 27:09.920
even though things
haven't gone so well lately.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.885
I hope that you can accept
our offer, Ethel,

27:19.920 --> 27:23.520
and that we can be friends.
We both wish you well, don't we?

27:23.555 --> 27:25.920
I don't wish you ill. I'll say that.

27:26.920 --> 27:29.040
I can't accept your offer.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.720
And we won't be friends.

27:33.755 --> 27:35.645
What?

27:35.680 --> 27:37.800
Not even for Charlie's sake?

27:39.120 --> 27:41.485
I think you love my son, Mr Bryant.

27:41.520 --> 27:44.440
I don't think
you're a nice or kind man,

27:44.475 --> 27:46.600
but I believe you love my boy.

27:48.280 --> 27:51.400
So you'll be pleased
by what I've come here to say.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.165
Any news while I was out?

28:02.200 --> 28:05.920
No. Perhaps the Home Secretary
won't see him.

28:05.955 --> 28:09.640
Papa will pull some strings
until he does.

28:10.560 --> 28:15.000
A-ha, you've started on the Augean
task. How are you getting on?

28:15.035 --> 28:19.000
Not badly. I'm beginning
to get a sense of how it works.

28:19.035 --> 28:21.480
It's probably best
you tackle it by yourself.

28:22.120 --> 28:26.300
Ah, Carson. May we please have
some tea? Oh, of course, My Lady.

28:26.335 --> 28:30.480
Anna said you're interviewing
footmen today. That is correct.

28:30.515 --> 28:32.645
Have you chosen the lucky winner?

28:32.680 --> 28:36.320
Not yet. There were two candidates
when it came down to it.

28:36.355 --> 28:39.045
One was steady but not much else,

28:39.080 --> 28:42.040
but the ladies downstairs
want the other one.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.485
Why is that?

28:44.520 --> 28:48.600
I don't know precisely, unless
it's because he's more handsome.

28:48.635 --> 28:51.217
Of course it's because
he's more handsome.

28:51.252 --> 28:53.765
Do pick him
and cheer us all up a bit.

28:53.800 --> 28:57.840
Alfred's nice, but he looks like
a puppy rescued from a puddle.

28:57.875 --> 29:00.800
This new one seems
very sure of himself.

29:00.835 --> 29:03.040
You can manage that, can't you?

29:03.075 --> 29:04.965
I suppose I could, sir.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.040
It's settled, then. Tell the maids
they can buy their valentines.

29:09.075 --> 29:11.000
So be it, My Lady.

29:12.920 --> 29:16.560
But Alfred is very good, you know.
He's very willing,

29:16.595 --> 29:19.280
even if he is Miss O'Brien's nephew.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.320
Clearly, nothing worse
could be said of any man.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.920
He'll want to say goodbye.

29:39.520 --> 29:44.920
I give you my blessings for your
whole life long, my darling boy.

29:44.955 --> 29:47.925
You won't remember that, or me,

29:47.960 --> 29:50.200
but they'll stay
with you all the same.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.040
Let's not make a meal of it.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.000
Mummy...

30:11.760 --> 30:13.685
I'll write to you.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.840
I'll never see my son again.

30:15.875 --> 30:17.960
Never is a long time, Ethel,

30:18.680 --> 30:22.080
but you were right,
he does love Charlie,

30:22.640 --> 30:24.760
and not just for his father's sake.

30:25.280 --> 30:27.200
I must be going.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.080
I'll say goodbye.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.480
You've done
a hard thing today, Ethel,

31:13.600 --> 31:15.560
the hardest thing of all.

31:17.480 --> 31:19.600
You don't agree, do you?

31:19.880 --> 31:23.640
I don't want to make you doubt
now that it's happened.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.725
You've done the right thing
for the boy, Ethel,

31:28.760 --> 31:32.160
whatever Mrs Crawley may say,
begging your pardon, ma'am.

31:32.195 --> 31:34.685
Perhaps you're right. I am,

31:34.720 --> 31:38.320
until we live in a very
different world from this one.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.640
Well, then,

31:41.640 --> 31:43.600
I should be away.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.840
What chance is there
for a woman like her?

31:56.320 --> 31:58.680
She's taken the road to ruin.

31:58.715 --> 32:00.440
There's no way back.

32:13.080 --> 32:15.800
Stand up! Against the wall,
the pair of you.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.440
What you looking for?
Just keep quiet.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.365
Mr Turner. Well, well.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.480
A very mysterious package,
I don't think.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.200
Craig,

32:43.800 --> 32:46.160
what do you call this?

32:47.320 --> 32:50.200
I don't know. I've done nothing.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.640
You'd better come with us, Craig.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.160
You'll be sorry.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.760
Oh, thank God!

33:42.960 --> 33:44.920
I'm so sorry.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
It's all right.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.765
They didn't try to stop me.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.220
It doesn't mean
they won't come after us,

33:55.255 --> 33:57.605
unless Papa can persuade them
otherwise.

33:57.640 --> 34:01.205
How could you have left her
to fend for herself?

34:01.240 --> 34:05.400
It wasn't like that. We thought this
might happen and decided what to do.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.040
The question is what now? You must
not travel before the baby's born.

34:12.560 --> 34:17.400
Tom wants it to be born in Dublin.
He won't hold you to that now.

34:17.435 --> 34:20.364
Won't this be the first place
they look?

34:20.400 --> 34:24.480
How could you be part of it?
The Drungores are like us.

34:24.514 --> 34:27.405
She came out with me,
she was Laura Dunsaney then.

34:27.440 --> 34:31.960
How could you dance round her burning
house? It's horrible. He didn't

34:31.995 --> 34:34.040
and isn't dancing now.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.925
Come in.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.920
Telegram for you, My Lady.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.760
Your father's coming home.
He's seen Mr Short.

34:46.795 --> 34:49.284
What happened? He doesn't say,

34:49.320 --> 34:52.320
only that neither of you
is to leave Downton.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.160
You're back.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.765
I am.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.805
Anything happened here?
There's a new footman.

35:05.840 --> 35:09.760
Came today. How was London?
Quite fun as a matter of fact.

35:09.795 --> 35:12.525
Has the firebrand been saved?

35:12.560 --> 35:15.800
That's not for me to say,
is it, Mr Molesley?

35:15.835 --> 35:17.920
I'd better take these upstairs.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.960
You got the job, then?
I'm on my way, Mr Barrow.

35:28.995 --> 35:31.525
They say you were a footman once.

35:31.560 --> 35:35.160
That's right. Can I come to you
if there's anything I need to know?

35:35.195 --> 35:37.120
Certainly. Why not?

35:46.240 --> 35:49.920
Never go back to Ireland?
Impossible. You'll be put in prison.

35:49.955 --> 35:51.965
It's the best I could manage.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.620
Surely they need proof to ban a man
from his own country.

35:55.655 --> 35:59.205
They have more proof
than Tom will concede. Is that fair?

35:59.240 --> 36:03.020
He's admitted to being there. He's
told you. But he didn't tell me

36:03.055 --> 36:06.800
he attended meetings where attacks on
the Anglo-Irish were planned.

36:12.560 --> 36:16.280
I was always against
any personal violence, I swear it.

36:16.315 --> 36:18.565
So at least we can sleep
in our beds.

36:18.600 --> 36:22.600
Maybe, but you weren't against
the destruction of property.

36:22.635 --> 36:24.765
That was worse than I expected.

36:24.800 --> 36:28.200
What was the deal you made
with the Home Secretary?

36:28.235 --> 36:31.125
They don't want
to make a martyr of him.

36:31.160 --> 36:35.800
With Sybil they think they could have
another Maud Gonne or Lady Gregory.

36:35.835 --> 36:38.925
Lady Gregory. Countess Markievicz.

36:38.960 --> 36:42.005
Why are the Irish rebels
so well born?

36:42.040 --> 36:46.000
Whatever the reason, I don't want
Sybil to join their ranks.

36:46.035 --> 36:48.405
Mercifully, nor do
the Irish authorities.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.160
If Tom can stay away,
they'll leave him alone.

36:52.920 --> 36:55.085
I can't be kept away from Ireland.

36:55.120 --> 36:58.520
You'll be arrested the moment
you touch dry land.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.205
Now, then, do what
Mr Carson tells you.

37:02.240 --> 37:05.325
I know what I'm about.
Are you all right, Alfred? Yes.

37:05.360 --> 37:09.400
Shouldn't I be carrying the pork
and you the veg? I'm first footman.

37:09.435 --> 37:12.400
Never mind that, go.
Isn't Alfred first footman?

37:12.435 --> 37:14.765
That's for Mr Carson to decide.

37:14.800 --> 37:19.200
By heck, it's nice to think we're
running at full strength again.

37:19.235 --> 37:22.720
Really? I'm running at full strength
with no-one to help.

37:22.755 --> 37:25.560
All in good time, Daisy.
All in good time.

37:28.200 --> 37:31.120
What do you mean
you wrote to a newspaper?

37:31.155 --> 37:33.405
No lady writes to a newspaper.

37:33.440 --> 37:37.480
What about Lady Sarah Wilson?
She's the daughter of a duke.

37:37.515 --> 37:40.960
She's a Churchill.
The Churchills are different.

37:40.995 --> 37:44.120
Have we no Churchill blood?
Granny's right.

37:44.155 --> 37:46.565
Can somebody write that down?

37:46.600 --> 37:50.760
It's good to have strong views
but notoriety is never helpful.

37:50.795 --> 37:53.237
I've sent it now.
It won't be published.

37:53.272 --> 37:55.645
Thank you for the vote
of confidence.

37:55.680 --> 37:59.680
This is our new footman, Mama.
What do we call you? Jimmy.

37:59.715 --> 38:02.765
James, Your Ladyship. This is James.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.840
Welcome to Downton, James.
Thank you, My Lord.

38:09.600 --> 38:13.160
Well done, Carson.
That must've cheered up the maids.

38:13.195 --> 38:16.685
He looks like a footman
in a musical review. Poor Alfred.

38:16.720 --> 38:20.900
We mustn't allow him to be
overshadowed. Quite right, My Lady.

38:20.935 --> 38:25.080
Hard work and diligence weigh more
than beauty in the real world.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.000
If only that were true.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.640
I've never been James in my life.
I was Jimmy to Lady Anstruther.

38:32.675 --> 38:35.845
I don't care if you were
Father Christmas.

38:35.880 --> 38:40.240
You're James now and will stay James
while you're at Downton.

38:43.720 --> 38:46.720
He thinks he's the big cheese,
make no mistake.

38:46.755 --> 38:48.565
That's because he is.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.085
He's nice, that new bloke, isn't he?

38:51.120 --> 38:56.120
Why do you say that?
Oh, only an impression, that's all.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.205
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to bed.

39:06.240 --> 39:10.200
Can you tell the others?
Tomorrow, we'll make some plans.

39:10.235 --> 39:12.200
I don't know how.

39:12.920 --> 39:16.800
You've lived out of Ireland before,
surely you can again.

39:16.835 --> 39:19.997
Ireland's coming of age,
I need to be part of that,

39:20.032 --> 39:23.160
but I know what you've done
for me, kept me free,

39:23.760 --> 39:27.320
and I am grateful, truly.

39:34.760 --> 39:37.840
Poor chap, I'm sure he is grateful.
No, he's not.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.445
He says it to keep the peace
with Sybil.

39:40.480 --> 39:44.160
But I only rescued him
for her sake so we're even.

39:46.160 --> 39:50.260
Did you get a chance to look through
the books they brought in?

39:50.295 --> 39:54.360
As a matter of fact, I did. Could
you make them out? I think so.

39:54.395 --> 39:58.525
I was waiting for a good moment
to discuss them. Oh?

39:58.560 --> 40:03.600
Yes. There were some aspects
of the way things have been done

40:03.635 --> 40:07.005
I wasn't quite sure about.
You sound like Murray.

40:07.040 --> 40:11.680
Do I? He's always going on about how
we should overhaul this or that.

40:11.715 --> 40:15.125
Nothing's ever right for him.
Well, I hesitate to say it...

40:15.160 --> 40:19.080
We should let them get in here.
We can talk about it another time.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.560
These came for you, Bates.

40:36.960 --> 40:40.120
When? When did they come?

40:40.400 --> 40:42.880
They came when
you were out of favour.

40:42.915 --> 40:44.880
Now you're in favour again.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.160
Why? What have I done?

40:53.760 --> 40:57.600
Just watch out for Mr Durrant.
You're not a favourite with him.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.440
What...

41:31.440 --> 41:35.160
Are you going to take that over me?

41:35.760 --> 41:38.485
I was just making myself some toast.

41:38.520 --> 41:42.400
You have to set the number
on the dial and I set it too high

41:42.435 --> 41:46.157
but I've got the hang of it now.
Would you like a piece?

41:46.192 --> 41:49.880
I thought Mr Branson might try
to burn the house down

41:49.915 --> 41:52.685
but I didn't think you would.
No?

41:52.720 --> 41:55.760
You should never take anything
for granted, Mr Carson.

41:56.320 --> 41:58.720
No, no, no. Not now.

42:02.560 --> 42:05.045
You never told me
you went to those meetings.

42:05.080 --> 42:08.880
I never told you I didn't.
What else haven't you told me?

42:08.915 --> 42:13.200
All I know is I can't stay here,
not for long.

42:13.235 --> 42:16.280
You must, and so must I.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.440
And you must let the baby
be born here.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.280
You're very free with your musts.

42:24.600 --> 42:27.640
I will not be free
with our child's chances.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.680
We need peace and safety.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.520
Downton can offer us both.

42:48.240 --> 42:52.360
God in heaven! "Earl's daughter
speaks out for women's rights"!

42:52.395 --> 42:56.005
What? "In a letter
to this newspaper today

42:56.040 --> 42:59.240
Lady Edith Crawley,
daughter of the Earl of Grantham,

42:59.275 --> 43:02.440
condemns the limitations
of the women's suffrage Bill

43:02.475 --> 43:05.045
and denounces the Government's aims

43:05.080 --> 43:08.165
to return women
to their pre-war existence."

43:08.200 --> 43:11.800
You said they wouldn't print it.
That's most impressive.

43:11.835 --> 43:15.597
Don't say you support her?
Of course I do, and so do you,

43:15.632 --> 43:19.360
when you've had a chance to think
about it. So I should hope.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.720
What do you think, Carson?
I'd rather not say.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.520
Anna... Yes?

43:33.120 --> 43:37.040
There's quite a packet of letters
arrived for you earlier.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.920
Are they all from Mr Bates?

43:44.520 --> 43:46.280
It looks like it.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.880
Why so many at once?
I neither know nor care,

43:50.915 --> 43:53.040
just as long as I've got them.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.200
Thanks for sticking up for me
last night.

44:07.235 --> 44:09.445
It won't make any difference.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.360
No, but it's good
to know you're on my side.

44:15.120 --> 44:17.040
I am on your side, Alfred.

44:18.320 --> 44:20.325
In fact,

44:20.360 --> 44:22.960
there's something
I've wanted to say.

44:22.995 --> 44:26.245
You've got my attention. Well...

44:26.280 --> 44:31.040
Here we are, Daisy. I'd like
to introduce Miss Ivy Stuart,

44:31.075 --> 44:35.800
the new kitchen maid. And this is
Daisy, my assistant cook.

44:37.040 --> 44:40.125
My, aren't you a sight
for sore eyes, Miss Stuart!

44:40.160 --> 44:44.720
That's enough of that. Alfred's
a footman, so don't listen to him.

44:44.755 --> 44:46.445
Shoo!

44:46.480 --> 44:48.440
Tell me if you need any help.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.720
Sorry, Daisy, what were you saying?

44:52.755 --> 44:54.720
Nothing. Don't matter now.

44:57.680 --> 44:59.765
I hope we're going to get on.

44:59.800 --> 45:03.240
We don't have to get on,
we have to work together.

45:10.080 --> 45:13.045
A situation has arisen

45:13.080 --> 45:16.405
and I'm not quite sure
which way to turn.

45:16.440 --> 45:20.640
Obviously, if you've turned to me.
Robert won't discuss the matter

45:20.675 --> 45:23.960
and Mary is affronted
by the very mention of it,

45:26.040 --> 45:30.160
but given that I've sunk my own
fortune alongside everyone else's

45:30.195 --> 45:33.360
into... Into Downton.
..I feel a duty,

45:33.395 --> 45:35.800
apart from anything else,

45:35.835 --> 45:38.000
to do what I can.

45:38.035 --> 45:39.640
About?

45:40.760 --> 45:42.920
Downton is being mismanaged,
cousin Violet,

45:42.955 --> 45:45.125
and something must be done.

45:45.160 --> 45:49.880
The thing is how do I do it without
putting people's noses out of joint?

45:49.915 --> 45:54.577
Oh, my dear. Oh, I doubt
there's a way to achieve that.

45:54.612 --> 45:59.205
You must do what needs to be done,
of course, but...

45:59.240 --> 46:04.320
I think I can safely say a great
many noses will be out of joint.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.725
Edith has been invited
to write a newspaper column.

46:50.760 --> 46:54.280
When will she get an offer
to appear on the London stage?

46:54.315 --> 46:57.800
I thought you might work here
for a while. You thought?

46:57.835 --> 47:00.165
I'm always a failure in this family.

47:00.200 --> 47:04.645
She meant you to be hanged for her
suicide. It was her revenge.

47:04.680 --> 47:09.320
What a revenge. Mrs Crawley's hired
a prostitute to manage her house?

47:09.355 --> 47:12.245
I don't remember Ethel
as a great cook.

47:12.280 --> 47:16.160
Please tell Mr Barrow him to keep
his distance. What are you implying?
