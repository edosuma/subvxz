00:06.924 --> 00:09.384
Pootie, Pootie, Pootie... Shoe!

00:09.927 --> 00:11.595
Who is the Masked Man?

00:11.678 --> 00:13.597
He is an NPC,

00:13.680 --> 00:17.434
or a Non-Playable Character
for all you noobs out there, all right?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.520
He's got a dope mask.
He's rockin' all black.

00:19.603 --> 00:22.314
He's got silver accents.
He's a loot giver.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.609
Yes! A firesword!
And a loot taker.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.237
Oh, man, he took my shield.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.532
But, you know, when he first came out,
Pootie was all like, "I love this dude,"

00:31.615 --> 00:32.616
because everyone did.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.869
MQ totally hyped him up.
I mean, he was in ads.

00:35.953 --> 00:38.038
Who is the Masked Man? Pre-order now.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.206
He was on T-shirts.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.292
Whoa! "Who is the Masked Man?"

00:42.376 --> 00:47.256
But then they never unmasked
the Masked Man, you guys.

00:47.339 --> 00:52.010
I mean, even when we asked it repeatedly
and repeatedly and repeatedly.

00:52.094 --> 00:56.765
One day his identity will be revealed,
and it will blow you away.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.350
He's comin', he's comin', he's comin'.

00:58.433 --> 01:01.520
A little bit later than originally
anticipated, but he's comin'.

01:01.603 --> 01:05.274
I just need you to just calm down a bit
and be patient, okay?

01:05.357 --> 01:08.402
I'm not-- Stop asking about
the Masked Man. Just stop asking about it.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.529
You know, now is not--
now is not the time.

01:10.612 --> 01:13.991
Just stop, all right?
You can... just stop.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.034
Till MQ comes up with some answers,

01:16.118 --> 01:19.663
some real, solid stuff,
we're gonna be here, waiting.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.124
The mystery continues.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.792
Pootie... Shoe!

01:23.876 --> 01:25.377
And there it is.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.506
Pootie Shoe is a 14-year-old boy.
Who cares what he thinks?

01:29.590 --> 01:33.010
Yeah, he's a real piece of shit,
but he's not wrong.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.720
He's a bully,
and he needs to be dealt with.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.555
-Jo, please.
-Dealt with?

01:36.638 --> 01:38.515
Ian, your judgment
is not to be questioned,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.267
not by Pootie, not by anyone else.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.102
-Jo.
-Poppy, David, shut up.

01:42.186 --> 01:45.397
Jo, your instincts on me are dead-on.
I love your enthusiasm.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.816
Guys, I'm not sweating this.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.486
Okay, Ian, C.W., it is time
to unmask the Masked Man.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.447
Okay, it's gonna be a huge event.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.950
The kind of event you might see
at the grand opening of...

02:00.120 --> 02:01.455
...the casino.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.625
No. The casino is an abomination.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.668
Okay, yeah, it's garbage.
But you guys wouldn't work on it,

02:06.752 --> 02:08.627
so I had to farm it out
to a studio in Bucharest.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.964
We wouldn't work on it
because it's an artless money grab

02:11.048 --> 02:12.841
that has no connection to the game.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.969
Okay, well, this is a great opportunity
to unify. Right?

02:16.053 --> 02:20.182
Spruce it up. Make it fit. The perfect
fusion of art and commerce.

02:20.265 --> 02:24.061
Brad, you know what?
In a lot of ways, you are the casino.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.481
A soulless money-suck
in the middle of an enchanted forest.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.150
We don't need that.
And we don't need you.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.488
Okay.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.326
Well, that was super weird.
David, anything else?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.912
Look, guys. You know I back creative.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.497
-It's kind of my bag.
-No, it's not.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.124
-Your bag is being a soy boy beta cuck.
-That's it.

02:46.208 --> 02:49.711
That's-- A soy boy beta cuck?
What is that?

02:49.795 --> 02:51.046
I'll explain it to you later.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.464
Is that a good thing?

02:53.048 --> 02:54.049
Mm-hmm.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.217
Okay, good.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.386
Look, but maybe Brad has a point.
All right?

02:57.469 --> 03:00.973
It's been two years. Maybe it's time
to reveal the Masked Man's identity.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.767
No. No, I don't think
now's the right time.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.435
They're not revealing it
because they don't know.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.813
We settled on his identity years ago.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.774
Look, guys,
it's just not the right time to reveal it.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.442
When it is, we will let you know.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.320
Now, can we please
just get back to work?

03:22.661 --> 03:24.746
-You think they bought it?
-I don't know.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.833
But, damn, I made a big deal
out of this stupid thing.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.126
Yeah.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.713
We better figure out who
the Masked Man is fast or we are fucked.

03:48.604 --> 03:49.897
Bad news, dude.

03:50.480 --> 03:55.152
Brad just told me that we have to log
all of the bugs in the casino ASAP.

03:55.611 --> 03:59.072
What? He told us to stay away
from the casino because it's so janky.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.450
I guess they're planning
some big event there now.

04:02.034 --> 04:06.246
Shit.
That's gonna take all night. I had plans.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.879
You know what?
It's been a long week. I'll cover for you.

04:14.671 --> 04:18.841
-No, you don't have to cover for me.
-Yeah. It's all good, man. I got you.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.554
Thanks, Rache.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.265
Sure. That's what friends are for, right?

04:45.827 --> 04:46.954
Wow.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.666
I should spend more time
in your office. It's super weird.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.836
Every book you've ever written is here.

04:53.919 --> 04:58.465
The Cape of No Hope.
The Fall of Hrad. Saturn's Desire.

04:59.550 --> 05:04.054
This was my favorite when I was a kid.
I will never forget the elven temptress.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.430
Nor I.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.975
She was based on a lover
I took in Morocco.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.978
Ironically, the proceeds from the book

05:11.061 --> 05:14.106
were used to pay for the medical bills
I incurred from the encounter.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.568
-Gross.
-Yeah.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.821
Let's get to work, shall we?

05:20.904 --> 05:21.947
-Yes.
-Yes.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.657
Yes! Now.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.411
Who are you?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.956
Obviously, when he takes off the mask,

05:31.039 --> 05:33.208
it must be emotional or no one will care.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.459
Right. Right.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.546
And the fact that he's both
a loot taker and a loot giver,

05:37.629 --> 05:39.548
there's something interesting there.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.216
-Ian.
-Not now, Jo. We're working.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.344
Got it. FYI, we're in business.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.847
Pootie's pissed.
He's definitely not chill.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.807
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
What? What's he saying?

05:48.891 --> 05:50.058
Here, check it out.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.769
You guys know
I'm all about the positivity,

05:52.853 --> 05:56.023
but I recently got some
serious hate from MQ,

05:56.106 --> 05:58.567
and I'm just wondering why--
why they would hate on me

05:58.650 --> 06:01.028
when I play their game, like, 24-7.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.238
You know what they say, "The fish
stinks from the head down", right?

06:03.322 --> 06:07.284
So, Ian, I mean, I just asked
who the Masked Man was.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.370
Just 'cause you don't know the answer,
you don't have to come at me for it.

06:10.454 --> 06:13.832
-Pootie's gonna ponder this.
-Pootie ponders.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.292
Boycott MQ?

06:17.085 --> 06:19.713
Not something I would have considered,

06:20.297 --> 06:21.798
but circumstances have changed.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.510
-What the hell did you say to him?
-I sent him a funny meme.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.221
It says, "Make everyone's day.
Kill yo--"

06:27.304 --> 06:29.139
Yeah, I see what it says, Jo.
Thank you.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.808
Why? Why would you send this
to a 14-year-old boy?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.353
It works. I used it on my bully,
Shannon, in high school.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.230
She didn't commit suicide, but she tried.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.359
Yeah, Jo, in that scenario,
I don't think Shannon was the bully.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.944
-Shannon was the bully.
-She was the victim.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.529
-No, Shannon was the bully.
-Shannon was the victim.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.656
I went over to her house before sixth
grade. She asked me to play with Barbies.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.990
I told her it was for babies,

06:47.074 --> 06:49.326
and the next day I got to school
and told everyone she queefs.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.622
In that scenario, how are you-- Okay.
All right. You know, it doesn't matter.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.500
Jo, can you just leave it alone?
Please just leave it alone.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.086
I've upset you. I'm so sorry.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.255
I can fix this. I promise.
Just give me another shot.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.800
Okay, fine.
Do you think you can just de-escalate?

07:05.884 --> 07:09.930
And, Jo, Jo, Jo.
Let's cool it with the suicide. Okay?

07:10.013 --> 07:11.515
He's gonna make his own decisions here.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.684
No, no, no. No. No. No. Let's...

07:14.309 --> 07:16.019
Let's stay away from the suicide,
all right?

07:16.103 --> 07:18.605
You can't really make anyone do anything.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.441
Yeah, but we-- we could maybe
endeavor to not push him into it.

07:21.525 --> 07:24.444
I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do,
and he's gonna do what he's gonna do.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.697
No, you're gonna do
what I tell you to do. Okay?

07:28.532 --> 07:29.658
Fine.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.039
If I could just harness her power
for good, I think we might be in business.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.457
Forget about her.

07:37.541 --> 07:42.212
Focus on this and we shall silence
Pootie... and his cuties.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.590
And dudies.

07:45.674 --> 07:46.800
Let us work.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.638
Yeah.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.946
Hey. We might have a problem.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.201
Yeah, I came back, and it was all gone.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.244
I mean, you think he's a fugitive?
He could be on the lam.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.455
People don't take their desks on the lam.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.291
He's obviously just trying to make
a point, to prove that we need him.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.212
A day without Brad.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.383
Damn. I just wish he had
thought of this plan earlier.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.093
Could have enjoyed it longer.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.553
Oh, well, I'm going home.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.431
What? No, wait. You can't leave.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.140
-I mean, what are we gonna do about this?
-Nothing.

08:36.225 --> 08:39.144
He's a toddler throwing a tantrum.
Just ignore it. It'll blow over.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.980
But, Poppy,
we cannot afford to piss Brad off.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.316
Monetization is a very important
revenue stream for us.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.485
Well, you need to make up
your mind, David.

08:46.568 --> 08:49.196
Do you back suits or do you back creative?

08:49.279 --> 08:50.489
Creative.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.283
Great. Then I need you to be cool.
Can you do that?

08:53.992 --> 08:54.993
Yeah.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.496
You look worried.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.081
No. No, I'm not worried.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.500
I was actually just thinking
of something else. No, I'm...

09:01.875 --> 09:03.585
No, I'm cool. You know?

09:03.669 --> 09:05.462
What is this? What are you doing?

09:06.255 --> 09:08.799
I'm just, like, hangin'. Yeah.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.970
Okay. So you're gonna--
You're gonna be cool?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.096
-Yeah.
-Great.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.099
You know me. I'm ice-cold, baby.

09:17.808 --> 09:20.060
All right. I want you to go home.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.812
-Yep. Cool.
-Get some rest.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.897
And all of this is gonna be okay
in the morning.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.190
All right, all right, all right.

09:25.274 --> 09:26.400
Don't do that.

09:30.654 --> 09:31.655
Cool.

09:37.452 --> 09:41.707
Dude, the dice disappear when they hit
the side of the craps table. New bug.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.709
-Nice.
-Janky.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.589
Glasses?

09:48.672 --> 09:52.259
Oh. Yeah. I only wear them at night.
I know they're dorky.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.304
No, I like 'em.
I've just never seen you wear them before.

09:55.387 --> 09:58.015
Yeah, my eyes get tired
from staring at the screen all day.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.225
And then I go home
and play MQ some more.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.102
Hold on. You, you play MQ after work?

10:02.186 --> 10:03.520
Hell, yeah.

10:03.604 --> 10:07.316
Me and my avatar, Toksvig? We tear it up
between the hours of eight and midnight.

10:07.399 --> 10:10.777
Come on, dude. That is so cute.
I can't believe you keep playing.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.572
Oh, it's almost midnight.
Didn't you have somewhere to be?

10:13.655 --> 10:16.533
Oh... yeah. No. We're good.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.869
-Really?
-Are you hungry?

10:22.456 --> 10:25.292
I know where Poppy hides her ice-cream
sandwiches that she stress-eats.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.627
Yeah.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.213
Wait. What if we get caught though?

10:33.217 --> 10:34.676
Looks like we're the only ones here.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.102
-Really good, right?
-Yeah.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.771
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.465
Boom, snap, pap, ba-boom, snap, pap.

11:13.549 --> 11:16.009
Snap, boom, snap, pap, ba-boom,
snap, pap.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.011
Boom, snap, pap, ba-boom, snap, pap.

11:18.095 --> 11:20.097
Snap, boom, snap,
pap, ba-boom, snap, pap!

11:20.180 --> 11:21.181
Yay!

12:17.070 --> 12:18.155
Bit of a problem.

12:20.449 --> 12:21.450
What is going on?

12:21.867 --> 12:24.119
Brad's tantrum got a little worse.

12:25.621 --> 12:28.665
Oh, my God. He shut down the store
and made everything free?

12:28.749 --> 12:30.667
Yeah, Sue called me this morning.

12:30.751 --> 12:34.713
People are going apeshit, grabbing all
the legendary loot boxes and OP weapons.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.216
It's a free-for-all. Literally.

12:37.299 --> 12:38.342
That's bad.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.511
As we speak,
thousands of super leveled-up players

12:40.594 --> 12:42.638
are churning through the new
Raven's Banquet content

12:42.721 --> 12:44.181
like it's wet tissue paper.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.434
-That's worse. That's worse.
-Okay, don't panic. It's cool.

12:47.518 --> 12:48.977
No, no. This is not cool.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.647
This is a red-hot poker
straight up my backdoor.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.273
Okay. We can't cave to Brad.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.234
This is hurting him
worse than it's hurting us.

12:55.317 --> 12:58.195
He loves money more than anything.
Brad is gonna cave.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.157
It took two years to build Raven's
Banquet, and they're tearing through it.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.076
Can't you just turn the prices back on?

13:04.159 --> 13:06.203
Brad's the only one
with financial access privileges.

13:08.247 --> 13:11.291
I know. Okay. You know what?
I think you just need to sit down.

13:11.375 --> 13:14.044
Just sit down. Just sit down.
Stop making that noise.

13:14.127 --> 13:18.173
Just breathe. Just breathe for me.
Just calm breathing. It's in and out.

13:18.549 --> 13:19.716
Out.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.885
And maybe take a breath mint.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.388
Just breathe in that direction,
'cause your breath is not great.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.889
This is what I'm gonna do, all right?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.683
I'm gonna get my team
to throw up some roadblocks.

13:27.766 --> 13:30.227
We can increase boss fight difficulty,
extend raids,

13:30.310 --> 13:31.854
nerf all the most powerful weapons.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.815
Yeah, you just need to be cool.
Can you do that? Can you be cool?

13:36.650 --> 13:38.402
Give me a nonverbal signal
that you're cool.

13:39.403 --> 13:42.531
Hey, there's my guy! You got this.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.116
Let's go to the coders' room.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.327
Good. Yes, you're doing great.
Just keep it cool.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.704
-You don't need to be striding so much.
-Yeah.

13:48.787 --> 13:49.872
Announcement!

13:53.667 --> 13:54.668
Michelle?

13:54.751 --> 13:56.628
That's my name.

13:56.712 --> 13:58.088
Where is everybody?

13:58.714 --> 14:00.007
Brad sent them home.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.092
He said without him,
you don't have the money

14:02.176 --> 14:05.012
to pay for a full programming team,
so they left.

14:05.095 --> 14:08.932
This isn't gonna work. There's no way
I can code that many roadblocks on my own.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.809
Okay, so, this is the part
where I'm gonna freak out.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.020
-Don't freak out.
-Well, what are we gonna do?

14:13.103 --> 14:15.898
I guess right now you must be realizing
that you need Brad.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.066
-Shut up, Michelle!
-Shut up, Michelle!

14:18.150 --> 14:20.402
He paid me a thousand dollars
to say that.

14:27.201 --> 14:30.412
Pootie, Pootie, Pootie... exclusive.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.290
So, since they won't unmask
the Masked Man,

14:33.373 --> 14:37.503
I've been thinking,
I'm going to unmask Ian Grimm.

14:37.586 --> 14:40.547
So, who is Ian Grimm?

14:40.631 --> 14:45.469
Well, according to his LinkedIn page,
he's a "builder of worlds."

14:45.552 --> 14:49.431
Whatever that means.
And check out his thirsty profile pic.

14:49.515 --> 14:50.724
Thirsty!

14:50.974 --> 14:52.434
So at least we know he's desperate.

14:52.518 --> 14:57.940
Oh, and a little known fact.
He's also a destroyer of dads.

14:58.023 --> 15:02.277
That is right. You heard it here first
on the Pootie Scoop.

15:02.361 --> 15:07.491
Ian Grimm sued his own dad!
"Prove it, Pootie"? Okay, cutie.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.828
Mr. Grimm,
is it true that you told your father

15:11.912 --> 15:13.789
that you'd take every last cent he had?

15:14.540 --> 15:17.668
I don't know.
Is it true that I **** your mom?

15:18.794 --> 15:21.630
Okay. Can you please answer the question
and not be nasty?

15:22.005 --> 15:23.715
That's what I said to your mom.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.884
All right. This is getting exhausting.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.970
Why don't we just take
a five-minute break?

15:28.720 --> 15:30.347
That's what your mom said.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.017
What an asshole.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.937
Nips. Thanks for watching.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.022
How did he find out about the lawsuit?

15:39.106 --> 15:40.274
I leaked it to him.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.984
Why? Why would you do that?

15:42.067 --> 15:44.570
'Cause you sued your own dad.
That's so badass.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.530
If you would treat
your own father like that,

15:46.613 --> 15:48.782
imagine what you're gonna do
to a little piece of shit like Pootie.

15:48.866 --> 15:52.703
Jo, I countersued my dad because
he tried to take my company, all right?

15:55.747 --> 15:57.791
-So he's the badass.
-No, he's not a badass.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.585
He's not a badass.
I'm not a badass.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.378
There is no badass in the situation,
all right?

16:01.461 --> 16:04.965
It's a very sad story of a father
and a son. It's complicated.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.842
Oh, no. I failed you.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.678
I'm just gonna read my own meme
and kill myself.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.639
Jesus Christ! Jo, Jo, Jo.

16:12.723 --> 16:15.100
Can we just stop talking about suicide?

16:15.184 --> 16:17.477
Can we just--
Can we just stop for a second?

16:17.561 --> 16:19.938
And why don't you go and serve David.

16:20.022 --> 16:23.233
See, that would be the best way
to serve me. Serve David.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.194
-Poison?
-Not poison.

16:25.277 --> 16:26.904
Not poison.

16:26.987 --> 16:30.574
Just anything he wants.
Coffee, tea. Nonlethal.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.076
Got it. Just make him sick
so he can't get in your way.

16:33.452 --> 16:34.828
Yeah. Jo, I--

16:36.455 --> 16:38.123
I think we're gonna have to let her go.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.292
No. Ian,

16:40.375 --> 16:45.130
the lunatic assistant
may have just unlocked this whole thing.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.007
She did?

16:47.841 --> 16:50.928
She realizes the relationship
between a parent and a child

16:51.011 --> 16:53.472
is what's emotionally investing.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.683
She also wants to murder David.

16:56.767 --> 17:00.646
Ian, this could be the emotional core
we've been looking for.

17:00.729 --> 17:04.942
The Masked Man
is a story of a father and a son.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.402
Interesting. Go on.

17:07.486 --> 17:09.780
The father's a villain
who represents the dark.

17:09.863 --> 17:13.242
But he has a son. A new character.

17:13.325 --> 17:15.536
And the son is the light.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.663
They're destined to duel.

17:18.372 --> 17:20.207
But before he slays him,

17:20.832 --> 17:25.170
the son brings the father from the dark
back to the light.

17:25.252 --> 17:29.466
And as he lay there dying,
the mask is removed.

17:30.509 --> 17:33.929
The Masked Man is the new hero's...

17:34.012 --> 17:35.305
father.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.101
That is...

17:40.686 --> 17:41.770
Star Wars.

17:42.813 --> 17:45.107
-"Star Wars"?
-Yeah. The movie?

17:45.190 --> 17:47.317
Came out in the '70s.
Like, one of the biggest ever?

17:47.401 --> 17:50.904
Well, admittedly, the '70s were a bit
of a blur, but it is ringing some bells.

17:50.988 --> 17:53.365
Yeah, I'll bet. They've made, like,
20 of 'em. They're still making 'em.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.117
-Really? Why?
-Nobody knows.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.619
Either way, it's a story that's been told,
so we can't tell it again.

17:57.703 --> 17:59.872
Why not? It's a monomyth trope.

18:00.664 --> 18:02.958
It's been done for millennia.

18:03.041 --> 18:07.004
The Odyssey. King Arthur.
Anything Tolkien. It's the classics.

18:07.546 --> 18:09.047
Right.
It's The Hero with a Thousand Faces.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.132
Yes.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.925
The Masked Man is a villain. I like it.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.179
Okay. But it still needs something,
doesn't it?

18:15.262 --> 18:19.433
We need something unique
that unifies the story.

18:19.516 --> 18:22.019
We need a Death Star.

18:23.103 --> 18:26.023
A "Death Star."

18:29.193 --> 18:30.194
What is that?

18:30.277 --> 18:31.653
Okay. Let's go watch the movie first.

18:31.737 --> 18:33.780
You know what?
Let's watch the movie, and then we'll...

18:33.864 --> 18:35.199
-Death Star?
-Yeah, come to my office.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.283
Who buys that?

18:37.576 --> 18:39.077
Can you stop running?

18:39.161 --> 18:40.954
He will not pick up! Goddamn it, Brad.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.915
All right. Get in the car.
We're going to his house.

18:42.998 --> 18:44.750
-David?
-Yeah?

18:45.709 --> 18:47.920
-What the hell?
-Forget to pay your parking tickets?

18:48.003 --> 18:49.630
No. No. I paid my--

18:50.506 --> 18:51.757
Oh, my God.

18:52.758 --> 18:56.261
I bought this car with the bonus money
we got from Brad's sexy wood nymph.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.597
How the hell did he know that?

18:58.680 --> 19:01.141
Maybe from the license plate?

19:01.225 --> 19:03.977
"Nymph Daddy"?
Really? You're the nymph daddy?

19:04.728 --> 19:07.231
I was-- Look, never mind.
Let's just take your car.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.899
I don't have a car. I'll call us a Lyft.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.109
You don't have a car?
How do you not have a car?

19:11.193 --> 19:13.028
You have 36 laptops and no car.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.072
Can I just say, this is why
you have trouble finding a man.

19:15.155 --> 19:18.116
You know who didn't have trouble
finding a man? Your ex-wife.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.788
Sorry. That was really out of line.
I'm sorry. That was--

19:22.871 --> 19:24.748
-No, you're right.
-No, it was--

19:24.831 --> 19:27.292
Your tension is kind of getting to me.
You-- You need to calm down.

19:27.376 --> 19:30.504
If we turn up at Brad's all panicked,
he's gonna think that he owns us.

19:30.587 --> 19:31.880
He does own us.

19:31.964 --> 19:34.258
Shit. My account's been deactivated.

19:36.093 --> 19:38.136
That's 'cause it's connected
to the corporate card.

19:38.220 --> 19:41.098
It's connected to the corporate card,
you stupid, stupid girl!

19:41.181 --> 19:43.600
-Woman.
-Women own cars! All right.

19:43.684 --> 19:45.102
So many stereotypes.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.271
-All right. Let's go back in.
-I don't know. Okay.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.733
I don't care if we have to run
to his house. We need Brad here now.

19:51.817 --> 19:55.529
David, just calm down. I think that
your blood sugar is running a little low.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.115
We just need to have a little snack,

19:58.198 --> 20:00.158
and then we can talk
through this rationally.

20:03.036 --> 20:07.624
Where the fuck
are my ice-cream sandwiches?

20:07.708 --> 20:09.042
-Poppy.
-Goddamn it, Brad!

20:09.126 --> 20:10.752
-I bought these with my own money!
-Poppy.

20:10.836 --> 20:12.796
When I find that son of a bitch,
I am gonna end him!

20:12.880 --> 20:14.006
He's right there.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.469
Brad. Brad? Brad. We need you.

20:19.553 --> 20:22.264
Listen, buddy,
my ice-cream sandwiches are not for--

20:22.347 --> 20:23.390
Poppy.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.768
I'm sorry I called you
a bottom-feeding corporate leech.

20:26.852 --> 20:28.937
-I thought it was "soulless money-suck."
-That too.

20:29.021 --> 20:32.065
Look, Brad, please,
can you just turn the prices back on?

20:32.149 --> 20:34.401
-Yeah, yeah. I already did that.
-You did? You caved?

20:34.484 --> 20:36.778
No, no. Ian agreed to unmask
the Masked Man at the casino,

20:36.862 --> 20:38.113
so I got everything I wanted.

20:38.739 --> 20:42.743
Yeah. You see, C.W. and I
figured out a way to unify everything.

20:42.826 --> 20:45.746
The Masked Man is a villain
who lives at a casino.

20:45.829 --> 20:46.955
Yeah, and it makes sense

20:47.039 --> 20:49.166
because the Masked Man
was a walking casino anyway.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.168
You know, a loot giver, a loot taker.

20:51.251 --> 20:52.336
Check this out.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.547
"The Masked Man's
Hall of Games and Chance."

20:55.631 --> 20:58.967
We're also going to create
a new character, the White Knight,

20:59.051 --> 21:01.053
who's destined to duel the Masked Man

21:01.136 --> 21:04.014
and eventually unmask him...
at the casino.

21:04.097 --> 21:08.477
See, the story brings the players in
and the casino bleeds them dry.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.522
Guys, it's the perfect fusion
of art and commerce.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.357
But, Ian, don't you hate Brad?

21:13.732 --> 21:16.193
Hate him? Oh, yeah, I do hate him.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.695
-Yeah, I feel nothing for him.
-He's a sociopath.

21:18.779 --> 21:22.908
But the money that he brings in
makes the whole game actually run.

21:23.909 --> 21:25.369
You get that, right?

21:26.578 --> 21:27.621
-Yeah.
-Yeah, duh.

21:27.704 --> 21:28.872
-Yeah, of course.
-Obviously.

21:28.956 --> 21:30.874
-Yes.
-No, we're cool. Yeah.

21:30.958 --> 21:33.043
-To be clear, David, you are not cool.
-No.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.671
Well... yeah. Well, she said I was.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.048
I lied to him.

21:42.553 --> 21:43.971
Okay. Well, great.

21:44.054 --> 21:46.306
So I guess you guys can spruce up
the casino. There's a lot of bugs.

21:46.390 --> 21:49.351
Testers found a whole bunch of 'em.
So that will be fun for you.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.520
Right. Well, that's her, not me.
Hey, by the way, who is it?

21:52.646 --> 21:53.689
The Masked Man. Who is he?

21:53.772 --> 21:58.360
Oh, yeah. The Masked Man
is the White Knight's father.

22:00.028 --> 22:01.321
Like Star Wars.

22:01.905 --> 22:05.117
It is a bit like Star Wars, yeah.
I was hoping you wouldn't notice.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.203
That was a crazy crunch, huh?

22:09.371 --> 22:11.290
We logged, like,
a hundred bugs last night.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.834
Hey. We broke our personal record.

22:14.293 --> 22:16.879
-Livin' the dream!
-Yeah.

22:20.966 --> 22:22.009
Well...

22:24.469 --> 22:26.054
back to reality.

22:26.597 --> 22:27.598
Yeah.

22:34.271 --> 22:36.773
I'll go tell 'em we're done.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.233
-Sweet.
-Sweet.

22:38.317 --> 22:39.359
Yeah.

22:40.319 --> 22:42.029
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

22:42.112 --> 22:44.740
All right. Peace out, girl scout.
