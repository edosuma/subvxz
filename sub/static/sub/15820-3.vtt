WEBVTT

00:03.311 --> 00:06.056
20053-2-9-0.

00:07.113 --> 00:08.025
No.

00:08.416 --> 00:11.063
20053-2-9-0.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.238
No.

00:13.728 --> 00:16.486
20053-2-9…
0?

00:16.789 --> 00:17.604
No.

00:20.268 --> 00:23.149
20053-2-9-0.

00:23.262 --> 00:25.704
Excuse me, ma'am. What are you doing?

00:26.123 --> 00:28.742
A good morning to you,
too, sergeant Gabriel.

00:28.782 --> 00:30.184
I'm checkin' toe tags.

00:30.224 --> 00:32.180
I can't reach the ones over there.

00:32.220 --> 00:34.949
20053-2-9-0.

00:35.012 --> 00:36.229
Is the winning number.

00:36.269 --> 00:38.429
You're supposed to let a
morgue attendant do that.

00:38.469 --> 00:41.239
Uh-huh. Well, they're not here
right now, sergeant, are they?

00:41.279 --> 00:43.886
So…
20053-2-9-0.

00:43.959 --> 00:45.436
Start over there, please.

00:45.476 --> 00:46.386
Thank you.

00:46.551 --> 00:48.211
Thank you so much.

00:48.795 --> 00:51.454
You know, if I knew who we were looking
for, this might go a little faster.

00:51.494 --> 00:53.367
No name, young lady,

00:53.526 --> 00:54.613
prostitute.

00:54.828 --> 00:56.794
Been in here 3 days already.

00:59.987 --> 01:01.688
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:04.337 --> 01:08.456
20053-2-9-0.
Oh…

01:09.548 --> 01:11.862
Oh, I found her. I found her.

01:12.006 --> 01:13.242
I just need some help.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.540
Just move this…

01:14.726 --> 01:15.817
Move this guy.

01:17.134 --> 01:21.486
Oh! So what makes a
hooker such a high-oh!

01:21.563 --> 01:23.073
priority all of a sudden?

01:23.113 --> 01:26.349
Her client list, as
disgusting as that sounds.

01:26.779 --> 01:30.026
Robbery homicide just
got it off her computer–

01:31.149 --> 01:35.435
Watch out. Which is why we are
so late gettin' handed this case.

01:37.182 --> 01:41.432
Ok, miss
20053-2-9-0.

01:41.618 --> 01:45.204
Let's see if you look
anything like your photo.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.800 --> 02:10.781
What the hell's goin' on here?

02:13.431 --> 02:16.392
Yes, but the ME. said this
girl had sex before she died.

02:16.432 --> 02:19.818
What I want to know is if anyone at
robbery homicide had the foresight

02:19.858 --> 02:22.886
to get a sex kit on her before
she was dumped at the morgue.

02:22.926 --> 02:24.642
Yes, I'll hold. Thank you.

02:26.123 --> 02:27.509
Anything on the I. D?

02:27.558 --> 02:28.959
No California record.

02:29.047 --> 02:30.017
I could go national.

02:30.057 --> 02:31.130
Go international.

02:31.170 --> 02:33.612
I just got the crime scene inventory.

02:34.083 --> 02:36.459
Her taste in furniture was eclectic.

02:37.568 --> 02:38.840
Excuse me, ma'am.

02:38.962 --> 02:41.151
If you're going to accuse
my people of doing bad work,

02:41.191 --> 02:43.501
would you mind doing it through me?

02:45.135 --> 02:47.608
Captain Taylor, let me be
extremely clear about this.

02:47.648 --> 02:49.615
I was not accusing
your people of bad work.

02:49.655 --> 02:51.635
I was accusing them of apathy.

02:51.727 --> 02:54.026
I have a murder victim
here who's been dead 3 days

02:54.066 --> 02:55.638
and I still don't know who she is.

02:55.678 --> 02:58.351
I have 43 active cases. You have one.

02:58.438 --> 03:01.050
And, of course, we ran
a sex kit on the body.

03:01.090 --> 03:01.993
We found here naked.

03:02.033 --> 03:04.409
So why don't I have the DNA results?

03:04.578 --> 03:08.507
Is it because all your department
saw was another dead hooker?

03:08.547 --> 03:09.570
No, ma'am.

03:09.817 --> 03:13.484
It's because it takes at least a
week for the DNA results to come back.

03:13.524 --> 03:15.882
Unless, of course, someone
is willing to spring

03:15.922 --> 03:17.457
for the extra thousand dollars,

03:17.497 --> 03:21.637
which no one was willing to do until
that girl's client list turned up.

03:21.677 --> 03:23.366
Now suddenly everybody cares.

03:23.406 --> 03:25.423
Let's not forget it
was my boys and girls

03:25.463 --> 03:28.194
who discovered that client
list in the first place.

03:28.234 --> 03:30.595
But you know what really gets me, ma'am?

03:30.635 --> 03:34.124
Every morning, you and I, we see
the exact same homicide report,

03:34.164 --> 03:36.289
and I didn't hear you
calling that girl's death

03:36.329 --> 03:38.228
some high priority, either.

03:38.505 --> 03:42.135
Maybe it's because all you
saw was another dead hooker.

03:54.431 --> 03:56.555
Look, she was doing judge Weigert.

03:56.595 --> 03:58.509
The guy's 80 and on a walker.

03:59.112 --> 04:00.366
Congressman Hilton?

04:00.452 --> 04:02.714
Whoa! There's over 200 names here.

04:02.781 --> 04:04.142
We can narrow that down.

04:04.182 --> 04:07.564
Put the client list away for
a moment, please. Thank you.

04:07.604 --> 04:11.354
Our young lady here has
multiple stab wounds in the back

04:11.425 --> 04:14.038
from a 6-inch serrated blade.

04:14.124 --> 04:18.075
The ME. can tell from the angle of the knife
wounds that the killer was taller than the victim.

04:18.115 --> 04:21.595
She was just shy of 6-feet, which
should eliminate most of her customers.

04:21.635 --> 04:24.279
We think it was one of her regular
Johns 'cause there was no sign

04:24.319 --> 04:26.182
of a break-in, robbery, or a struggle.

04:26.222 --> 04:27.065
Sergeant Gabriel?

04:27.105 --> 04:28.279
Our victim

04:28.596 --> 04:31.737
was one of the many available
ladies at an internet escort service.

04:31.777 --> 04:33.163
This is her web page:

04:33.188 --> 04:35.169
strawberrylollipop.com.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.148
Lollipop?

04:36.229 --> 04:38.869
Looks more like an
all-day sucker to me.

04:39.755 --> 04:43.121
All right, I would appreciate if we could
remember that this girl's a murder victim,

04:43.161 --> 04:44.546
and, unfortunately,

04:44.973 --> 04:48.338
Strawberry Lollipop is all we
have to call her at the moment.

04:48.378 --> 04:51.536
Now, uh, inside her web site,
she had a booking program,

04:51.576 --> 04:53.895
and on the computer from
her house, we got a calendar.

04:53.935 --> 04:56.576
Now, in december, she had 65 clients.

04:56.659 --> 04:58.264
In january, 71,

04:58.378 --> 04:59.943
february, 68.

05:00.107 --> 05:01.031
Then in march,

05:01.077 --> 05:04.484
miss Lollipop moves into her new
house and drops to 25 clients.

05:04.524 --> 05:06.161
She was down to her
regulars.

05:06.201 --> 05:08.879
Which is why we have to
interview these men first.

05:08.919 --> 05:11.408
5 of them are over 6-feet,

05:11.486 --> 05:17.154
3 of whom have been dubbed
by the LAPD brass as VIPs.

05:17.231 --> 05:19.576
And here is the crime scene.

05:28.923 --> 05:31.067
Now, the estimated time of death

05:31.140 --> 05:34.440
is last Friday night
between 8 p. m. and midnight.

05:37.046 --> 05:40.462
We need alibis from every man
on that list taller than 6-feet,

05:40.502 --> 05:42.900
starting with the most recent
and working our way back.

05:42.940 --> 05:46.203
Maybe one of her Johns became her
sugar daddy and bought her the house.

05:46.243 --> 05:48.066
Or someone she cut loose got mad.

05:48.106 --> 05:49.938
Detective Gabriel, if
you'll check and see

05:49.978 --> 05:53.262
if the MO. of the knife wounds
match any other recent homicides,

05:53.302 --> 05:55.046
especially relatin' to prostitutes.

05:55.086 --> 05:56.073
Detective Sanchez,

05:56.113 --> 05:59.541
if you could start setting up
interviews with her customers.

05:59.581 --> 06:01.285
What if they don't want to come in?

06:01.325 --> 06:04.102
Tell them we'd hate to visit them at
work to talk about their sex lives.

06:04.142 --> 06:05.379
But if we must…

06:05.614 --> 06:08.155
Lieutenant Flynn, a warrant
for her phones, please.

06:08.195 --> 06:10.679
Detective Daniels, if you
could meet me downstairs.

06:10.719 --> 06:14.239
If any of her customers
pop in while I'm gone…

06:14.736 --> 06:16.117
Lieutenant Provenza?

06:17.137 --> 06:18.898
If you could talk to 'em, please.

06:18.938 --> 06:19.805
Thank you.

06:20.277 --> 06:21.539
Yeah, ok.

06:22.124 --> 06:24.302
I can be disgusted all afternoon.

06:25.273 --> 06:26.126
Why not?

06:33.800 --> 06:34.871
Brenda?

06:34.946 --> 06:35.725
What?

06:35.913 --> 06:37.807
Where are you going? Aren't you
going to interview the Johns?

06:37.847 --> 06:39.825
Lieutenant Provenza can talk to 'em.

06:39.865 --> 06:40.649
Ok.

06:41.157 --> 06:42.039
Really?

06:42.475 --> 06:44.908
Provenza? I don't want
any feathers ruffled.

06:44.948 --> 06:46.294
Excuse me. I'm confused.

06:46.334 --> 06:48.726
Is prostitution a crime in Los Angeles?

06:48.766 --> 06:52.352
I just don't want anybody's career ruined
if all they did was was pay for sex.

06:52.392 --> 06:53.927
That means no prying
into their private lives

06:53.967 --> 06:56.190
unless you think they're
good for the murder.

06:56.230 --> 06:59.787
Are you talkin' about someone
particular on that client list?

06:59.827 --> 07:00.641
Yeah.

07:01.368 --> 07:02.575
Danny Booth.

07:03.042 --> 07:05.084
He's an immigration and
customs enforcement agent.

07:05.124 --> 07:06.946
I've known him 8 years.

07:07.099 --> 07:08.287
Are you his alibi?

07:08.572 --> 07:10.180
No, more of a character witness.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.770
Danny's a… basically a solid guy.

07:12.970 --> 07:14.474
He helped me with the
financials in my divorce,

07:14.514 --> 07:16.890
and he's getting married next month.

07:17.094 --> 07:20.628
Well, I'd hate to ruin what sounds
like such a promising marriage.

07:20.668 --> 07:22.219
Um, your friend

07:22.302 --> 07:24.939
Mr Booth was one of my
girl's few remaining regulars.

07:24.979 --> 07:26.349
He saw her last Thursday,

07:26.389 --> 07:27.659
and he's over 6-feet.

07:27.699 --> 07:29.831
Um, sorry. He's comin' in.

07:30.339 --> 07:31.905
All right. I want to be there.

07:31.945 --> 07:32.659
Ok.

07:32.782 --> 07:33.985
–Off the books.
–On.

07:34.025 --> 07:36.574
No. My office, 8 a. m. tomorrow.

07:47.706 --> 07:48.926
Nice place.

07:49.232 --> 07:50.684
Except for the murder.

07:51.015 --> 07:53.144
Well, we all have a past.

07:55.751 --> 07:57.529
How does she afford all this?

07:57.569 --> 07:59.985
$500 a dance,

08:00.235 --> 08:01.312
4 times a month,

08:01.388 --> 08:03.406
and her accent was russian.

08:03.631 --> 08:05.941
That's all I knew about her. Sorry.

08:06.013 --> 08:08.096
Where were you last Friday night…

08:08.136 --> 08:09.124
your honor?

08:09.397 --> 08:11.727
Are you seriously looking
at me for this murder

08:11.767 --> 08:14.034
because of my height, detective?

08:14.404 --> 08:17.523
Only time that I was taller than
her was when I stood up straight,

08:17.563 --> 08:21.383
which I have not done since 1993.

08:24.720 --> 08:25.525
All right.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.027
Last Friday night…

08:32.938 --> 08:36.017
my girlfriend and I went to
Santa Barbara for the weekend.

08:36.057 --> 08:39.442
I would rather you confirm
that through the hotel.

08:39.563 --> 08:43.682
So did your friendly neighborhood
whore ever talk about other boyfriends?

08:43.722 --> 08:46.240
I didn't pay that mouth to talk.

08:46.596 --> 08:49.962
I only cared what it
did to me in her bed.

09:25.951 --> 09:27.793
My dog was hit by a car,

09:27.930 --> 09:29.471
and so we were at the vet's.

09:29.511 --> 09:32.081
The whole family, my wife, kids.

09:32.451 --> 09:34.695
I'm sorry about that, congressman.

09:34.883 --> 09:36.385
Your dog make it?

09:38.308 --> 09:39.158
Yeah.

09:41.898 --> 09:45.276
So, uh, who all knows about this?

09:46.773 --> 09:49.865
What kind of information are you
letting out to the press about this girl?

09:49.905 --> 09:52.052
I can see you really care about her.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.271
You know what? Screw you.

09:53.311 --> 09:54.786
She has a boyfriend. Go after him.

09:54.826 --> 09:55.573
Name?

09:55.660 --> 09:58.133
Mr Lollipop, how the hell do I know?

10:00.639 --> 10:03.015
You should talk to some contractors.

10:03.076 --> 10:05.286
He was remodeling her kitchen.

10:06.038 --> 10:07.814
Granite countertops,

10:07.903 --> 10:09.219
custom cabinets,

10:09.383 --> 10:11.032
stainless range–

10:11.375 --> 10:12.986
expensive stuff.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.118
New.

10:30.381 --> 10:34.709
I'd like to order 2 sweet and sour
chicken dinners to be delivered, please.

10:34.749 --> 10:36.551
Uh, 707 Edgemere.

10:37.354 --> 10:39.862
You might have my credit card on file.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.490
There's a cat in the bedroom.

10:43.530 --> 10:44.646
It looks, uh…

10:45.190 --> 10:46.510
I'll call the pound.

10:47.252 --> 10:48.374
Oh, that's great.

10:48.539 --> 10:50.796
Um, I'm sorry. May I ask, um…

10:50.980 --> 10:54.940
the name on the credit card,
is that mine or my boyfriend's?

10:55.634 --> 10:57.263
Meet Nick Koslov,

10:58.077 --> 11:00.556
illegitimate son of Ivan Koslov,

11:00.642 --> 11:02.424
top guy in the russian mob.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.652
They're pretty new here in town.

11:04.692 --> 11:07.200
Captain Taylor is our resident expert.

11:07.226 --> 11:09.655
–Rather have him brief you?
–Not really.

11:09.695 --> 11:12.482
Their chief business
is heroine distribution.

11:12.522 --> 11:15.077
Nick does not seem to be
too much involved with that.

11:15.117 --> 11:18.517
All we got on his rap sheet's and old assault
and battery charge, which was dropped.

11:18.557 --> 11:20.519
Daddy has good lawyers. Where are they?

11:20.559 --> 11:23.038
We offered him counsel and he declined,

11:23.078 --> 11:25.388
although he did say he was thirsty.

11:35.712 --> 11:38.360
Deputy chief Brenda Thompson.
You want something to drink?

11:38.400 --> 11:39.195
Thank you.

11:41.025 --> 11:43.140
Nicolai Koslov.

11:43.233 --> 11:44.887
Did I pronounce your name correctly?

11:44.927 --> 11:47.237
Perfectly, but people call me Nick.

11:48.412 --> 11:51.583
So, Nick, this is a
sad occasion for you.

11:51.705 --> 11:54.013
Woman you know was
killed the other night,

11:54.053 --> 11:55.373
stabbed in the back.

11:55.561 --> 11:58.597
You're talkin' about
Zoya Petrovna, I presume?

11:59.616 --> 12:00.514
So you knew her?

12:00.554 --> 12:01.623
Ok, Gabriel–

12:01.728 --> 12:02.986
Zoya Petrovna.

12:03.519 --> 12:05.148
–You got a name now.
–She was a whore.

12:05.188 --> 12:06.772
Yeah, if I can spell it.

12:07.022 --> 12:09.786
Do you regularly give whores
access to your credit cards,

12:09.826 --> 12:12.466
buy them houses, remodel their kitchens?

12:12.572 --> 12:16.479
Because all that makes it seem like
you were more serious than that.

12:16.519 --> 12:17.815
Do you know why you think that?

12:17.855 --> 12:18.658
Why?

12:18.971 --> 12:20.356
Because you're a woman.

12:20.396 --> 12:21.379
Oh.

12:23.426 --> 12:25.638
You don't give women money and
jewelry and bullshit like that

12:25.678 --> 12:26.914
because you love them.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.528
You do it so you can get off and leave.

12:29.605 --> 12:34.602
So I guess that would explain why you
seem relatively unaffected by her death?

12:34.642 --> 12:36.099
I'm sorry for her.

12:37.306 --> 12:38.141
I am.

12:39.884 --> 12:43.448
It's inconvenient. I'll have
to find someone else now.

12:48.182 --> 12:50.031
I don't mean to sound cold really.

12:50.071 --> 12:51.521
She had some redeeming qualities,

12:51.561 --> 12:53.806
but she's not the kind of girl
you could take home for dinner.

12:53.846 --> 12:55.084
She was just there for sex.

12:55.124 --> 12:56.209
Exactly…

12:57.649 --> 12:58.694
when I wanted it.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.978
Did you want it last Friday night?

13:01.396 --> 13:02.319
Twice.

13:04.469 --> 13:05.591
In the afternoon.

13:05.637 --> 13:10.587
So I might find evidence of your semen
in the sex kit we took off the body?

13:10.608 --> 13:14.370
Well, it depends on where you
check, but, yeah, probably.

13:18.739 --> 13:21.643
And where were you
later, Nick, between, um,

13:22.565 --> 13:24.162
8 p. m. and midnight?

13:24.819 --> 13:28.449
Unfortunately, I was stuck
at 10080 Wilshire Boulevard.

13:28.958 --> 13:30.344
The federal building?

13:30.469 --> 13:31.431
Yeah.

13:32.016 --> 13:33.352
On the 14th floor.

13:33.577 --> 13:35.227
Have you ever been there?

13:35.779 --> 13:37.231
You were with the FBI?

13:37.311 --> 13:39.819
From 7 p. m. till 5:00 in the morning.

13:45.861 --> 13:48.917
Well, that really sucks.

14:00.177 --> 14:01.117
Fritz?

14:01.234 --> 14:02.884
Yeah, I'm a little early.

14:06.906 --> 14:09.499
Just-just one second. Ok? Um…

14:10.214 --> 14:11.397
One second.

14:11.557 --> 14:13.501
Gosh, you are really early.

14:14.389 --> 14:15.857
I'm sure you look terrific.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.215
Oh, no, it's not that. I just, um…

14:18.728 --> 14:20.005
I just got home…

14:20.335 --> 14:21.319
So…

14:22.648 --> 14:23.404
late.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.111
How was your day?

14:27.347 --> 14:28.418
It was ok.

14:28.696 --> 14:29.477
Good.

14:29.580 --> 14:30.483
Are you all right?

14:30.523 --> 14:31.676
Yes.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.929
Just one second.

14:35.587 --> 14:36.904
Almost ready.

14:37.859 --> 14:39.363
Just one second.

14:41.230 --> 14:42.202
Ok!

14:45.546 --> 14:46.662
–Hi!
–Hey.

14:46.745 --> 14:47.722
Sorry about that.

14:47.762 --> 14:48.700
Come on in.

14:51.700 --> 14:52.470
Whoops.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.934
Oop. Gotta find a place for those.

14:55.879 --> 14:57.155
How about your own house?

14:57.195 --> 15:02.079
Well, I don't even know where I want
to live yet. I mean, L. A. 's so big.

15:02.664 --> 15:06.482
Well, if you see somethin' you like, you should
snap it up because the market's hot here.

15:06.522 --> 15:08.395
Good stuff doesn't stay
on the shelf very long.

15:08.435 --> 15:09.447
Yeah, well…

15:10.196 --> 15:12.374
I just don't wanna move too fast.

15:13.715 --> 15:16.223
I mean, you know, it's a big decision.

15:17.968 --> 15:19.039
Yes, it is.

15:19.197 --> 15:20.542
Well, you know…

15:20.833 --> 15:22.615
if you're comfortable here…

15:25.037 --> 15:25.719
So…

15:25.888 --> 15:27.594
–you want the good news or bad news?
–Good news.

15:27.634 --> 15:29.317
I got us a table on a patio.

15:29.357 --> 15:30.296
Oh, good!

15:30.731 --> 15:32.914
Bad news is, your
guy's tellin' the truth.

15:32.954 --> 15:36.573
Nick Koslov was in FBI
custody from 6:30 to 5 a. m.

15:42.255 --> 15:45.393
I was in bed by 9:00 on Friday.

15:46.515 --> 15:49.942
Is there an aspirin
around here somewhere?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.070
I had to be at work at 5:00 on Saturday,

15:54.110 --> 15:55.854
so Friday's tough for me.

15:55.926 --> 15:57.389
Can someone verify that?

15:57.429 --> 15:59.072
Just my dog. Other than that–

15:59.112 --> 16:01.643
Did you know that you
were Zoya's first customer?

16:01.683 --> 16:02.975
Her name is Zoya?

16:03.088 --> 16:05.408
Not to burden you with
too much information

16:05.448 --> 16:08.102
about the woman you were having
sex with on a regular basis,

16:08.142 --> 16:11.439
but, yes, her name was Zoya Petrovna.

16:11.548 --> 16:13.463
She was an immigrant from Russia.

16:13.503 --> 16:17.648
And when she started keeping
records around january 2nd,

16:17.720 --> 16:19.868
you're listed as her first John.

16:21.932 --> 16:22.733
Really?

16:23.229 --> 16:24.641
What's the significance of that?

16:24.681 --> 16:27.924
Because last Thursday, the
day before Zoya was murdered,

16:27.964 --> 16:31.377
Mr Booth was also the last
appointment on the calendar,

16:31.417 --> 16:34.245
which makes him her alpha and omega–

16:34.367 --> 16:35.974
the beginning and the end.

16:36.014 --> 16:37.147
–Coincidence.
–Excuse me.

16:37.187 --> 16:39.041
Are you acting as his defense counsel?

16:39.081 --> 16:40.232
He doesn't need a lawyer, Brenda.

16:40.272 --> 16:42.987
Then he's perfectly capable of
answering these questions on his own.

16:43.027 --> 16:46.577
So. You saw Zoya 3,4 times a week?

16:47.750 --> 16:48.948
Was she that good?

16:51.430 --> 16:53.047
I like certain things.

16:53.143 --> 16:54.397
How'd you meet her?

16:54.728 --> 16:56.090
Ad in the L. A. weekly.

16:56.130 --> 16:58.490
She didn't have an ad in the
L. A. weekly. She had a web page.

16:58.530 --> 16:59.916
Your friend is lyin'.

17:01.050 --> 17:04.482
Come on. That… that's an
easy thing to get mixed up.

17:06.810 --> 17:10.627
So. You like “certain things”,
and these things cost money…

17:10.667 --> 17:12.644
around $500 an hour.

17:12.711 --> 17:16.762
So you were shellin'
out about $2,000 a week

17:16.855 --> 17:18.656
On a federal salary?

17:22.492 --> 17:24.143
Do I have to answer that?

17:24.275 --> 17:25.592
Ok. That's enough.

17:25.664 --> 17:27.515
Thank you so much, Mr Booth.

17:27.624 --> 17:30.858
We'll meet again under
more formal circumstances.

17:33.493 --> 17:34.747
I'll see you later.

17:36.921 --> 17:38.825
All right, so the guy's a bit of a mess.

17:38.865 --> 17:41.739
But you didn't have to swipe the cup.
He would've given you a DNA sample.

17:41.779 --> 17:43.585
And you're wasting your
time. Danny's innocent.

17:43.625 --> 17:46.868
Well, I don't know if he killed her
yet, but he's certainly not innocent.

17:46.908 --> 17:48.914
Hey, guys lie,

17:49.002 --> 17:50.652
especially about hookers.

17:50.690 --> 17:52.547
Zoya Petrovna, Will.

17:52.643 --> 17:53.717
Zoya Petrovna.

17:53.799 --> 17:55.909
She had a name. She was 18 years old,

17:55.949 --> 17:57.512
practically a child.

17:57.703 --> 17:59.515
And she came here from Russia on a visa.

17:59.555 --> 18:00.511
And where's your friend work?

18:00.551 --> 18:02.927
Immigration and customs enforcement.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.868
Last night you were hot on Nick
Koslov. What happened to him?

18:08.908 --> 18:10.982
During the time of the
crime, he was with the FBI.

18:11.022 --> 18:12.540
They've confirmed that.

18:12.739 --> 18:14.284
Why'd the FBI get back to you so fast?

18:14.324 --> 18:17.822
I'm still waiting to hear
back on Oswald and Kennedy.

18:19.486 --> 18:21.615
What do we have on the phone dump?

18:21.655 --> 18:25.206
Uh… she talked to 3
people almost every day.

18:25.370 --> 18:27.679
Nick Koslov, Nadia Orwell…

18:28.069 --> 18:30.460
and a cat psychic named madame Lulu.

18:30.547 --> 18:33.342
Any calls to Ossie E. or Danny booth?

18:33.414 --> 18:35.291
Mmm… no, nothing.

18:35.373 --> 18:39.453
Lt. Provenza, I want a full background
check on this customs officer at L. A. X.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.988
financial, criminal, and public.

18:41.028 --> 18:43.552
And pay special
attention to the fiancée–

18:43.592 --> 18:46.067
where and what she was doin'
at the time of the crime.

18:46.107 --> 18:48.185
Find me Nadia Orwell.
The quicker, the better.

18:48.225 --> 18:52.076
And take this cup and the soda
can Nick Koslov was drinkin' out of

18:52.116 --> 18:53.812
and rush them to the DNA lab.

18:53.852 --> 18:55.511
I know. It's an extra $2,000.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.135
I'll deal with it. Gabe–

18:57.315 --> 18:58.865
Where's sgt. Gabriel?

18:59.312 --> 19:01.041
Ok, let's see.

19:01.128 --> 19:02.141
Here we go.

19:02.555 --> 19:04.884
Russian prostitutes…

19:04.975 --> 19:08.038
and we'll add some of the
breakaway soviet republics as well.

19:08.078 --> 19:08.938
What's the MO.?

19:08.978 --> 19:11.097
A 6-inch serrated blade in the back.

19:11.137 --> 19:12.194
Stab wounds.

19:13.261 --> 19:15.192
Well, let's see how
this new program works.

19:15.232 --> 19:16.597
Ready to spin the wheel?

19:16.637 --> 19:17.863
Go for it, Franny.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.844
You want my homicide analyst,
your boss is supposed to ask.

19:20.884 --> 19:24.143
Ah. Hey, captain. I… only
need Franny for 10 minutes, tops.

19:24.183 --> 19:25.738
Well, I'm not sure if, uh,

19:25.778 --> 19:29.464
Franny's work is up to miss
Atlanta's exacting standards.

19:29.504 --> 19:33.002
Uh, frankly, sir, miss
Atlanta doesn't know I'm here.

19:33.474 --> 19:34.362
Really!

19:36.019 --> 19:39.324
I hear she likes Pope's friend
from this russian hooker.

19:39.364 --> 19:41.344
Well, I'm tryin' to clear him.

19:41.504 --> 19:42.693
–Yeah?
–Yeah.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.494
Good. Keep at it.

19:44.597 --> 19:46.542
Jackpot! Here we go, sarge.

19:46.617 --> 19:48.198
Another russian prostitute.

19:48.238 --> 19:49.411
Multiple knife wounds in the back.

19:49.451 --> 19:50.804
Found about 6 months ago.

19:50.844 --> 19:51.564
Bingo.

19:51.666 --> 19:53.144
Doesn't get any closer that that.

19:53.184 --> 19:54.607
I should be in Vegas this morning.

19:54.647 --> 19:55.901
Yes, you should be.

19:57.115 --> 20:00.721
Say, captain, you're
the expert on Koslov.

20:00.788 --> 20:04.154
You hear anything that
might help me out with this?

20:05.344 --> 20:07.210
Run along, now, Gabriel.

20:07.682 --> 20:10.388
Your boss needs me,
she knows where I am.

20:44.705 --> 20:46.500
Hey, Fritz. It's me.

20:47.303 --> 20:48.671
Uh, Brenda.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.244
Uh, just wanted to, uh…

20:52.206 --> 20:53.729
call and say, uh…

20:54.364 --> 20:56.275
thank you for dinner last night.

20:56.315 --> 20:57.427
And, uh…

20:58.543 --> 21:02.027
See? I can call when it
has nothin' to do with work.

21:04.140 --> 21:06.971
And, um… I had a
really nice time, too.

21:07.524 --> 21:10.578
And I just wanted to, you know, call you

21:10.654 --> 21:13.425
and tell you that. So, ok, thanks again,

21:13.512 --> 21:15.624
and I'll talk to you later. Bye.

21:15.665 --> 21:19.142
Um… and have a good
day, now. Bye-bye.

21:24.245 --> 21:25.396
Nadia Orwell?

21:26.049 --> 21:28.482
Deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, LAPD.

21:28.522 --> 21:30.521
I need to talk to you
about Zoya Petrovna.

21:30.561 --> 21:31.997
I do not know this Zoya.

21:32.037 --> 21:34.005
Really? She calls you almost every day.

21:34.045 --> 21:35.680
When was the last time you spoke to her?

21:35.720 --> 21:37.714
I have american husband
now. We have money.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.341
We pay tax. My baby's…

21:39.479 --> 21:43.109
But you used to work for
Nick Koslov. Isn't that right?

21:43.321 --> 21:46.889
Don't you think it's strange that you
haven't heard from Zoya since last Friday?

21:46.929 --> 21:48.594
I do not know this Zoya!

21:48.686 --> 21:50.699
Can you help me? Please?

21:51.841 --> 21:54.343
Did you care about her at all, Nadia?

21:54.793 --> 21:56.707
Did she mean anything to you?

21:59.818 --> 22:00.986
Can you help me?

22:01.482 --> 22:03.459
Please? Can you help me?

22:06.079 --> 22:09.511
I had tried to tell her is
more bad than we thought,

22:10.053 --> 22:11.856
but Zoya come anyway.

22:12.502 --> 22:14.234
We all come anyway.

22:14.445 --> 22:15.673
How do you get in?

22:15.882 --> 22:17.014
Is arranged.

22:17.722 --> 22:21.261
Passport and visa come in
mail with tickets to L. A.

22:21.461 --> 22:25.150
We get off plane, show
up for man in airport,

22:25.242 --> 22:26.984
um… what is it…

22:27.636 --> 22:28.840
uh, customs.

22:28.942 --> 22:31.648
Did one of these men
stamp your passport?

22:32.389 --> 22:34.248
Sick pig.

22:38.198 --> 22:40.464
We all have to date him.

22:40.719 --> 22:42.269
Zoya his favorite.

22:42.397 --> 22:44.141
She look young, you know?

22:44.740 --> 22:46.588
To him, she was like a drug.

22:47.508 --> 22:49.351
Do you think he could've killed her?

22:49.391 --> 22:51.482
Any drug can make you crazy.

22:55.601 --> 22:56.921
What about this man?

22:57.230 --> 22:59.273
He no do nothing. Just…

22:59.536 --> 23:00.856
smell feet.

23:04.626 --> 23:05.796
And Nick Koslov?

23:08.019 --> 23:09.603
He was your boss, right?

23:11.034 --> 23:11.907
Nick?

23:14.176 --> 23:16.124
His father's a scary guy.

23:17.490 --> 23:20.586
Nothing you say will go
anywhere. I-I promise that.

23:20.626 --> 23:22.542
I'm just tryin' to find out the truth.

23:22.582 --> 23:25.618
I just want to find out
what happened to Zoya.

23:28.970 --> 23:30.456
Nick like her.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.387
Took her to a party.
Put her in nice house.

23:33.427 --> 23:34.943
Zoya happy at first.

23:35.091 --> 23:36.060
What happened?

23:36.243 --> 23:40.005
She want husband like I get.
Want to become american. Ok?

23:40.918 --> 23:44.289
One day she call, tells
me she coming up with baby.

23:45.092 --> 23:46.716
Next day she cry.

23:47.373 --> 23:50.226
Nick hit her. Says she
have baby, he send her home.

23:50.266 --> 23:51.841
Was she planning on leaving him?

23:51.881 --> 23:53.237
She cannot leave.

23:53.975 --> 23:56.978
Nick keep our passports until
we have money to get them back.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.033
Always is more money than they say.

23:59.073 --> 24:00.481
You got out, though.

24:05.036 --> 24:09.451
If you give them 3
others, they let you go.

24:12.244 --> 24:14.240
And you let Zoya come…

24:14.759 --> 24:17.201
knowin' what was gonna happen to her.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.565
I betray her.

24:20.533 --> 24:21.613
Yes.

24:25.373 --> 24:30.200
I try to get her to change
mind before she leave.

24:30.265 --> 24:33.667
I tell her not to come.
I tell her… more bad.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.231
I–I
tell–

24:52.550 --> 24:53.970
Chief, look what I found.

24:54.010 --> 24:57.617
Unsolved brentwood homicide
from november 6, '04.

24:58.272 --> 25:02.441
Vanya Kastanka, 19, multiple
stab wounds in the back.

25:03.340 --> 25:04.811
Where's the ME. report?

25:04.851 --> 25:06.435
It wasn't with the file.

25:10.506 --> 25:15.505
Ok, entered the U. S. at Lax
on 9-19-04 on a visitor's visa.

25:15.577 --> 25:17.116
She paid her rent on time, in cash,

25:17.156 --> 25:19.667
and had unclaimed property
worth several thousand dollars.

25:19.707 --> 25:21.208
Booth can't afford these things.

25:21.248 --> 25:24.175
On his salary, but I'm thinking
he might do some moonlighting.

25:24.215 --> 25:25.156
Oh, no.

25:26.141 --> 25:28.497
Oh, I do not feel good about this.

25:34.235 --> 25:36.188
Deputy chief Johnson, sergeant Gabriel,

25:36.228 --> 25:38.923
this is Bill Blackburn and
Steven Sims from the FBI.

25:38.963 --> 25:41.798
Pleased, gentlemen. To what
do I owe this privilege?

25:41.838 --> 25:44.938
I'm afraid we have a little overlap
issue in the Zoya Petrovna murder.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.054
Oh, really? What's that?

25:46.094 --> 25:47.807
Can't say any more than that.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.634
National security. Sorry.

25:49.767 --> 25:54.453
But if you give us your files in
this case, we'd greatly appreciate it.

26:19.070 --> 26:20.555
I had nothing to do with this.

26:20.595 --> 26:24.291
Just a lucky break for your
friend Danny Booth, I guess.

26:24.355 --> 26:26.313
You know what, think what you want, ok?

26:26.353 --> 26:27.937
I don't control the FBI.

26:31.876 --> 26:32.887
Look at 'em.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.368
Smug bastards taking all our stuff.

26:35.590 --> 26:37.314
Not all, sergeant Gabriel.

26:37.727 --> 26:40.954
Although I do find it interesting
how an 18-year-old russian hooker

26:40.994 --> 26:44.559
suddenly becomes a vital concern
of our national security apparatus.

26:44.599 --> 26:46.416
Who are we to question the FBI?

26:46.456 --> 26:48.774
They asked for Zoya, Zoya they get.

26:48.858 --> 26:51.469
They didn't, however,
ask for Vanya Kastanka,

26:51.509 --> 26:54.941
and suddenly I find I got
all this time on my hands.

27:06.183 --> 27:08.715
How many of these unmarked
graves are you gonna dig up?

27:08.755 --> 27:10.702
As many as necessary.

27:22.576 --> 27:24.378
Are you ever gonna answer that?

27:24.418 --> 27:26.307
It's Pope. If I answer it,
he'll tell me to come back

27:26.347 --> 27:28.613
and I have no intention of doing that.

27:28.653 --> 27:30.928
I know this is unsettling, father.

27:31.011 --> 27:32.463
No, no. It's my fault.

27:32.696 --> 27:34.299
We bury too many russian girls here.

27:34.339 --> 27:37.042
Drugs, aids, suicide.

27:37.279 --> 27:39.985
It's too much liberty,
too fast, I think.

27:40.824 --> 27:43.353
I must start a fund for head stones.

27:45.513 --> 27:47.123
How do they get here?

27:47.324 --> 27:48.704
Why do they come?

27:49.560 --> 27:52.596
I cry for them, but I
don't know who they are.

27:54.818 --> 27:57.091
Ah, here she is.

27:57.244 --> 27:59.473
This is the girl you were
looking for, isn't it?

27:59.513 --> 28:00.641
Yeah, it's her.

28:01.057 --> 28:04.694
I meant to put a little
special marker on her grave,

28:04.791 --> 28:06.705
but I never got around to it.

28:06.798 --> 28:08.135
Special marker? Why?

28:08.610 --> 28:10.589
Because she was pregnant.

28:15.022 --> 28:18.454
She always sits at the back
row, usually with a man.

28:19.115 --> 28:22.179
One day she stopped
me after the service,

28:22.280 --> 28:23.955
when the man wasn't there,

28:23.995 --> 28:25.703
told me she was pregnant,

28:25.928 --> 28:28.040
but was afraid to have the baby.

28:30.577 --> 28:32.838
Maybe I gave her the wrong advice.

28:34.420 --> 28:36.061
The man she was with,

28:36.539 --> 28:38.359
you recognize either of these gentlemen?

28:38.399 --> 28:39.349
Yes, him.

28:39.734 --> 28:41.417
He was very, very tall.

28:44.588 --> 28:47.316
Where were you november 6,2004?

28:47.687 --> 28:49.180
That was 6 months ago.

28:53.611 --> 28:55.484
Wait. Um…

28:55.863 --> 28:56.962
november 6,

28:57.181 --> 29:00.019
that's the day before
my mother's birthday.

29:01.608 --> 29:03.060
I was in the hospital.

29:03.878 --> 29:05.159
Glendale Memorial.

29:05.246 --> 29:07.157
Appendectomy the day
before. Check it out.

29:07.197 --> 29:08.726
I'll take your word for it.

29:08.766 --> 29:11.406
I don't think you killed Vanya Kastanka.

29:11.419 --> 29:12.511
Vanya…?

29:12.620 --> 29:16.042
Although I'm sure you slept with her as
you do all the young girls from Russia

29:16.082 --> 29:18.555
whose passports you
stamp, visas you approve.

29:18.595 --> 29:20.377
Isn't that right, Mr Booth?

29:20.540 --> 29:22.490
Along with the money that
the russian mob pays you,

29:22.530 --> 29:25.498
don't you also have your
choice of all the young ladies

29:25.538 --> 29:28.508
that you can legally
allow into this country?

29:29.056 --> 29:30.215
Oh, god.

29:32.987 --> 29:35.761
Oh, god. You know what? I'd might, uh…

29:35.911 --> 29:37.843
I might need an attorney.

29:37.953 --> 29:39.729
Oh, no, no, no. You
don't need an attorney

29:39.769 --> 29:42.684
because if you get an attorney, I
plan to sit down with your fiancée

29:42.724 --> 29:46.972
and have a nice, long chat with her about
what you've been doing with your penis.

29:47.012 --> 29:49.091
You'd do that? You would
drag Ellen into this?

29:49.131 --> 29:51.744
Oh, I'd do that. I do that
and so much more than all that.

29:51.784 --> 29:54.576
Yeah, I'd hold off on that
deposit for the caterers, too, man,

29:54.616 --> 29:57.181
because to be honest with
you, I'm just not seeing it.

29:57.221 --> 29:58.079
Your wedding.

29:58.154 --> 30:00.218
It's just not clear to me.

30:00.305 --> 30:01.522
Here's what I want you to do.

30:01.562 --> 30:03.278
I want you to call the FBI

30:03.619 --> 30:05.303
and make an appointment to talk to them

30:05.343 --> 30:07.765
to tell them what you
do for the Koslovs.

30:07.805 --> 30:08.795
What⁈

30:09.175 --> 30:10.565
I can't do that.

30:10.648 --> 30:11.772
I can't talk to them.

30:11.812 --> 30:13.545
I didn't ask you to talk to 'em.

30:13.585 --> 30:15.820
I asked you to make an
appointment to talk to 'em.

30:15.860 --> 30:18.896
Special agents Steven
Sims and Bill Blackburn.

30:22.904 --> 30:23.832
Thank you.

30:33.656 --> 30:35.539
Hi, y'all. Remember me?

30:36.852 --> 30:38.565
Chief Johnson, sure.

30:38.971 --> 30:39.959
What can we do for you?

30:39.999 --> 30:41.101
Mind if I come in?

30:41.141 --> 30:42.814
Actually, we have an appointment.

30:42.854 --> 30:44.834
Danny Booth sends his regrets.

30:46.929 --> 30:48.000
May I sit down?

30:49.124 --> 30:49.990
Thank you.

30:50.294 --> 30:54.008
I found another case that
might interest you gentlemen.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.660
Another murder,

30:55.927 --> 30:57.938
Vanya Kastanka,

30:58.071 --> 31:00.928
also a russian immigrant, also a hooker,

31:01.026 --> 31:04.590
also stabbed in the back
with a 6-inch serrated blade.

31:04.679 --> 31:08.538
Also in what I can only describe
as an alarming coincidence,

31:08.578 --> 31:10.209
dating Nick Koslov.

31:10.527 --> 31:13.068
In fact, DNA samples
show that she was pregnant

31:13.108 --> 31:15.382
with his baby at the time
that she was murdered.

31:15.422 --> 31:16.761
Isn't that amazing?

31:17.034 --> 31:20.388
And I began to wonder if
you two might also have known

31:20.428 --> 31:23.728
where Nick was when Vanya
got a knife in the back?

31:24.242 --> 31:27.933
We've had him under surveillance
for a year and a half.

31:28.293 --> 31:30.618
We might be able to save you some time.

31:30.658 --> 31:31.932
What's the date of death?

31:31.972 --> 31:35.588
September 6,2004,5:00 to 9:00 p. m.

31:49.938 --> 31:52.370
He had the flu. He was home sick.

31:52.446 --> 31:54.612
September 6. It's right here.

31:54.719 --> 31:56.659
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say september 6?

31:56.699 --> 32:01.475
I meant october 6 between 8:00 in
the morning and 2:00 in the afternoon.

32:13.106 --> 32:15.532
He was in Vegas, Caesars Palace.

32:17.554 --> 32:20.714
And if I picked another
date and another time?

32:20.807 --> 32:23.419
We'll have been watching him then, too.

32:24.510 --> 32:25.491
Ok?

32:27.425 --> 32:29.055
Is it clear to you now?

32:32.344 --> 32:36.568
And what about the next time he
brutally murders a teenage girl?

32:49.407 --> 32:52.591
I said arrest Nick Koslov, but
make sure he's with his father.

32:52.631 --> 32:55.960
And sergeant Gabriel, ask captain
Taylor for his help, please? Thank you!

32:56.000 --> 32:56.858
Brenda, wait!

32:56.867 --> 32:58.474
We should not be talking right now.

32:58.514 --> 32:59.274
Why not?

32:59.361 --> 33:02.475
Were you lying to me when you
said that Nick was in FBI custody?

33:02.515 --> 33:04.364
I told you what they told me.

33:04.404 --> 33:07.743
Look, Brenda, this is a
giant rico investigation.

33:07.826 --> 33:11.480
Ivan Koslov owns a drug smuggling
empire worth billions of dollars.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.915
I know it's hard, but you
got to see the big picture.

33:13.955 --> 33:15.962
I used to paint the big picture, ok?

33:16.002 --> 33:17.342
I know what's going on here.

33:17.382 --> 33:18.995
Nick was never in FBI custody.

33:19.035 --> 33:20.832
Your friends flipped him so
he turned against his father

33:20.872 --> 33:22.392
which is why they've given him an alibi.

33:22.432 --> 33:23.289
What do you want me to say?

33:23.329 --> 33:25.531
I want you to say that letting
people kill teenage girls

33:25.571 --> 33:27.716
because they got good
connections to the mob is wrong,

33:27.756 --> 33:30.680
I want you to say that in America
we are all equal under the law,

33:30.720 --> 33:34.098
and I want you to say that you think what's
going on here is morally reprehensible.

33:34.138 --> 33:38.200
Brenda, what is going on
here is morally reprehensible.

33:39.201 --> 33:40.485
Thank god for that.

33:40.566 --> 33:42.370
But it doesn't matter what I think,

33:42.410 --> 33:45.559
it doesn't matter what you think,
because this is what's happening.

33:45.599 --> 33:47.909
They're gonna stand by their story.

33:47.990 --> 33:52.874
Well, I certainly hope they do because
that's how I plan to close my case.

33:53.453 --> 33:55.895
I hope you're not mad at me tomorrow.

34:01.791 --> 34:04.588
Brenda, what is it the
FBI calling me about?

34:04.628 --> 34:06.355
Will, I was just about to come see you,

34:06.395 --> 34:08.210
but first I can help
your friend Danny Booth.

34:08.251 --> 34:09.141
Forget him.

34:09.253 --> 34:11.841
Sex with a hooker is one
thing, but this other stuff,

34:11.880 --> 34:13.574
I'll turn him in to the feds myself.

34:13.614 --> 34:15.536
Just tell me why they're calling me?

34:15.576 --> 34:17.974
I had Nick Koslov arrested for murder.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.735
He's in one of the interview
rooms right now, sir.

34:20.775 --> 34:21.920
Brenda, you can't do that.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.888
One minute. Just hold on.

34:23.980 --> 34:25.545
And he's got his attorney with him?

34:25.585 --> 34:26.632
Oh, yes.

34:26.755 --> 34:29.705
Andy Osterman, one of the
top mob attorneys in the city.

34:29.745 --> 34:32.219
I don't know why you
wanted it that way, man.

34:32.260 --> 34:33.908
He'll never let Nick talk to you.

34:33.947 --> 34:34.782
Oh, god.

34:34.888 --> 34:36.538
One minute. Just hold on.

34:36.630 --> 34:37.818
I'll explain this.

34:37.929 --> 34:42.027
Captain Taylor, I'd really appreciate anything
you can tell me about Nicholas Koslov,

34:42.068 --> 34:45.896
especially in regards to his
relationship with his family.

34:46.612 --> 34:50.089
Um, all right. Sure.

34:50.763 --> 34:53.913
Nick is from the wrong
side of the sheets.

34:54.018 --> 34:56.550
Son of his father's second
mistress, an american girl,

34:56.590 --> 34:58.269
I forget her name.

34:58.386 --> 34:59.438
A pro.

34:59.682 --> 35:02.784
She went missing when
he was about 4 years old.

35:03.178 --> 35:05.624
What else might help you here?

35:08.905 --> 35:12.355
All right, he's not
very high up the ladder.

35:12.442 --> 35:16.158
His legitimate brothers get most of the
bigger responsibilities and the money,

35:16.198 --> 35:18.112
Nick just manages the ladies.

35:18.857 --> 35:20.325
He's the family pimp.

35:22.455 --> 35:23.805
If that helps.

35:25.190 --> 35:27.582
Yes, it explains a few things.

35:27.696 --> 35:28.609
Thank you.

35:29.135 --> 35:30.613
Thank you very much.

35:35.122 --> 35:37.696
Why don't you ever just call me and say

35:37.708 --> 35:38.941
I'm gonna be running around today

35:38.981 --> 35:41.143
and while I'm out, I
might be ruining your life.

35:41.183 --> 35:43.924
This is an FBI case, Brenda. What
do you expect me to say to them?

35:43.964 --> 35:46.873
Just keep them off my back for 5
minutes. Please, just 5 minutes.

35:46.913 --> 35:50.083
I promise I'm not gonna arrest him,
I'm just gonna ask him a few questions.

35:50.123 --> 35:51.530
5 minutes. Pretty please?

35:51.570 --> 35:56.256
Ok, but if you see black helicopters
circling the building, wrap it up.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.879
Good evening, Mr Osterman.

36:05.981 --> 36:07.826
Deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.

36:07.866 --> 36:08.833
Hello, Nick.

36:09.003 --> 36:11.999
You always jerk people out of
family dinners in handcuffs?

36:12.039 --> 36:14.792
You sent Mr Koslov's uncle to
the hospital with chest pains.

36:14.832 --> 36:17.168
Not a good beginning
to our relationship.

36:17.208 --> 36:20.106
Oh, this isn't the beginning
of Nick's and my relationship.

36:20.146 --> 36:21.828
We're old friends now, aren't we, Nick?

36:21.868 --> 36:22.642
How so?

36:22.744 --> 36:24.252
I talked to him a few days ago

36:24.292 --> 36:25.941
about the murder of Zoya Petrovna.

36:25.981 --> 36:27.001
Without an attorney?

36:27.041 --> 36:28.566
Offered and declined.

36:28.752 --> 36:30.663
What are you, stupid?
Why didn't you call me?

36:30.703 --> 36:32.906
I didn't do it, that's
why. It wasn't a big deal.

36:32.946 --> 36:35.929
You know what, this isn't
about breaking the alibi, guys.

36:35.969 --> 36:38.188
That's a good thing because
it's not gonna happen.

36:38.228 --> 36:40.670
I've got something new to talk about.

36:40.887 --> 36:42.085
Do you recognize this woman?

36:42.125 --> 36:43.079
Don't answer that.

36:43.119 --> 36:45.158
I'll help you, Nick. Her
name's Vanya Kastanka,

36:45.198 --> 36:47.818
also a prostitute with
whom you were familiar,

36:47.858 --> 36:51.382
also stabbed in the back with
the same knife used to kill Zoya.

36:51.422 --> 36:54.563
We freely stipulate Nick's
attraction to young whores.

36:54.603 --> 36:57.375
This particular whore
might be more interesting

36:57.415 --> 36:59.492
than the others being
that DNA test prove

36:59.532 --> 37:02.198
that she was the mother
of Nick's unborn child.

37:02.238 --> 37:04.067
So he knocked up a whore.

37:05.261 --> 37:06.265
It happens.

37:06.361 --> 37:07.684
Yes, it does.

37:07.785 --> 37:09.943
In fact, that's how little
Nicholas entered the world.

37:09.983 --> 37:11.161
Isn't that so?

37:11.417 --> 37:13.453
Nothing can change that, can it?

37:13.493 --> 37:15.916
You'll never be part
of the family, will you?

37:15.956 --> 37:17.871
Your brothers will always come first,

37:17.911 --> 37:20.602
and when your father dies, you may
be cut out of the business altogether.

37:20.642 --> 37:21.851
Tell me, Nick,

37:21.943 --> 37:24.197
did what happened to your mom
when you were a little boy,

37:24.237 --> 37:27.339
did that make you think
whores were disposable?

37:33.646 --> 37:37.460
Enough with the armchair
psychology, Ms Johnson.

37:37.734 --> 37:39.605
If you have any evidence,
we would like to hear it.

37:39.645 --> 37:42.032
If not, we will wait for a
judge to throw this out of court.

37:42.072 --> 37:42.926
Fine.

37:43.660 --> 37:46.015
Since Nick here won't
tell me where he really was

37:46.055 --> 37:48.464
during the time of
Zoya and Vanya's murder,

37:48.504 --> 37:51.388
perhaps, Mr Osterman, you
can tell me where you were?

37:51.428 --> 37:53.812
What does where I was
have to do with anything?

37:53.852 --> 37:56.561
Well, your Nick's
criminal attorney, right,

37:56.601 --> 37:57.730
for his whole family?

37:57.770 --> 38:00.044
Yeah, I am. So?

38:00.198 --> 38:04.671
So you were with him last Friday when
he was being questioned by the FBI?

38:04.711 --> 38:05.934
From…

38:06.405 --> 38:07.759
Yeah, from…

38:08.500 --> 38:11.121
7:00 p. m. until 5:00 in the morning.

38:11.485 --> 38:12.597
Weren't you?

38:12.807 --> 38:15.451
Because I can't imagine
that the FBI would arrest

38:15.491 --> 38:18.008
and question a criminal
suspect for 10 hours

38:18.048 --> 38:19.646
without his attorney present,

38:19.686 --> 38:24.504
or that that Nick wouldn't have called
for you under those circumstances.

38:27.587 --> 38:32.620
And since the FBI provides your client
with an alibi for both murders incidentally,

38:32.660 --> 38:35.749
my only hope of getting
this case in front of a jury

38:35.789 --> 38:39.985
is if I can prove that Nick was not in
federal custody at the time of Zoya's murder.

38:40.025 --> 38:41.939
So can you help me with that?

38:47.048 --> 38:48.112
No.

38:51.586 --> 38:53.236
No, I don't think so. No.

38:54.009 --> 38:56.099
Well, I tried.

38:58.172 --> 39:00.482
You're free to go, Nick. Thank you.

39:05.460 --> 39:07.572
Come on, Nicky. Time to go home.

39:09.041 --> 39:10.453
This is it, Nick.

39:10.546 --> 39:12.328
There's nothing more to do.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.038
No, you wait.

39:19.537 --> 39:21.121
–I want to confess.
–No.

39:21.287 --> 39:23.271
–I want to confess.
–No, you're coming home–

39:23.311 --> 39:24.447
Get off of me!

39:24.729 --> 39:27.413
I want to confess! I want to confess!

39:27.572 --> 39:28.940
Get in there! Get in there!

39:28.980 --> 39:30.015
Go! Go!

39:30.629 --> 39:32.748
I confess! I confess!

39:33.031 --> 39:34.972
–Help!
–I confess!

39:35.322 --> 39:36.832
I confess!

39:37.943 --> 39:40.021
Don't do this!

39:40.068 --> 39:40.976
No, get off of me!

39:41.016 --> 39:42.666
I'll tell you everything!

39:42.803 --> 39:43.991
I killed 'em both.

39:44.253 --> 39:45.483
I used the same knife.

39:45.523 --> 39:48.955
I was with him. He was
being questioned by the feds.

39:50.975 --> 39:51.884
Help me.

39:52.232 --> 39:54.026
Help me, please. You gotta help me.

39:54.066 --> 39:57.812
I'd love to help you, Nick, but
I can't break your alibi, see?

39:57.852 --> 40:02.076
And I just don't know who the
jury will believe, you or the FBI.

40:02.339 --> 40:04.562
I ought to kill you,
too, you damn whore.

40:04.602 --> 40:06.745
Escort him out of the building, please.

40:06.785 --> 40:09.887
Don't let them do this.
Don't let them do this!

40:10.113 --> 40:13.364
Please, I beg you! Damn it!

40:22.840 --> 40:25.869
I say we call Sims and
Blackburn at the FBI.

40:26.037 --> 40:28.941
Let them know we just
released Nick and, oh,

40:29.309 --> 40:31.712
you call 'em in about 3 hours.

40:32.603 --> 40:34.422
3 hours, he'll be dead.

40:34.546 --> 40:37.673
Uh-uh. He'll be buried in 3 hours.

40:38.105 --> 40:40.877
He'll be dead when he
leaves the building.

40:49.298 --> 40:50.732
Brenda…

40:51.777 --> 40:53.634
what did you just do?

41:26.846 --> 41:28.139
–Hi.
–Hey.

41:29.005 --> 41:29.822
Come in.

41:33.285 --> 41:34.152
So,

41:35.501 --> 41:37.456
this is the place you're
thinking of buying?

41:37.496 --> 41:40.148
Yeah, it's going at a reduced rate.

41:40.379 --> 41:42.357
Probably 'cause of the murder, I guess.

41:42.397 --> 41:45.103
The owners are desperate
to get rid of it

41:45.505 --> 41:47.029
and it comes furnished, too.

41:47.069 --> 41:51.082
Not exactly my style, but
I can move in next week.

41:51.738 --> 41:52.594
It's nice.

41:52.852 --> 41:53.975
It's close to work.

41:54.015 --> 41:54.883
It's nice.

41:56.438 --> 42:01.033
So, I'm sure you heard Nick Koslov
was found murdered last night.

42:02.219 --> 42:03.901
Had his throat slit.

42:04.793 --> 42:07.935
So, the world is short
another budding serial killer.

42:07.975 --> 42:10.549
And the Koslov empire remains standing.

42:11.216 --> 42:12.305
Not exactly.

42:13.347 --> 42:14.741
Meet Danny Booth,

42:14.896 --> 42:17.800
an immigration and
customs enforcement agent

42:17.882 --> 42:20.387
that your friends can
use to replace Nick.

42:20.427 --> 42:22.663
He'll make a deal and he
needs protective custody.

42:22.703 --> 42:23.998
From the Koslovs?

42:24.077 --> 42:26.658
Yeah, and his fiancée.

42:30.143 --> 42:32.755
Look, it wasn't my job
to protect Nick Koslov.

42:32.795 --> 42:35.583
It was my job to seek
justice for those victims,

42:35.623 --> 42:36.597
the teenage girls.

42:36.637 --> 42:37.561
You know what,

42:37.582 --> 42:43.502
maybe we shouldn't talk
about work for a while.

42:43.610 --> 42:44.672
Ok.

42:46.872 --> 42:48.918
What do you want to talk about?

42:58.780 --> 43:00.496
I'll let you know, Brenda.

43:04.599 --> 43:06.183
You mind if I take that?

43:06.255 --> 43:07.659
No. No.

43:15.622 --> 43:16.684
Damn!

43:17.274 --> 43:19.782
The pound was supposed to pick him up.

43:20.984 --> 43:23.426
That's what I love about you, Brenda.

43:23.621 --> 43:25.733
That sentimental heart of yours.

43:44.326 --> 43:46.492
Oh, all right. All right.

43:46.922 --> 43:50.816
She must have left some food
around here for you somewhere.

43:55.988 --> 43:58.166
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

43:58.619 --> 44:00.046
Here, kitty, kitty.

44:01.548 --> 44:02.797
Yeah.

44:03.133 --> 44:04.338
Come on,

44:04.820 --> 44:06.638
you can trust me.

44:07.705 --> 44:09.465
You can trust me.

44:10.654 --> 44:11.910
Come on.

44:13.302 --> 44:35.691
Gotcha!
