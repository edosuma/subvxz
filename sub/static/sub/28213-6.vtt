00:00.055 --> 00:03.898
What if I told you my papers were
considering endorsing Angela?

00:03.923 --> 00:05.061
She's the only one listening.

00:05.086 --> 00:08.124
I only pick the winner,
and this time, it's not you.

00:08.125 --> 00:12.030
I stole from my mum. If no-one
knows, how does your son know?

00:12.055 --> 00:15.280
I'm dying. You go for Caden, go for Max.

00:15.281 --> 00:18.734
If you ever want to arrange
an interview...

00:18.735 --> 00:20.694
Extortion, bribery!

00:20.695 --> 00:22.602
The only person who can hurt us is you.

00:22.603 --> 00:24.974
- Tell me her name.
- Her name is Orla.

00:24.975 --> 00:26.455
I know her better than you.

00:26.480 --> 00:30.252
Someone for me spying for you!

00:30.252 --> 00:35.011
The son of the Muslim Prime Minister
started browsing fanatical websites.

00:35.012 --> 00:38.332
- Would you run that story?
- I would run the story about you.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:35.652 --> 01:38.332
- All right, everybody...
- Excuse me.

01:46.292 --> 01:47.612
It's fine.

01:55.612 --> 01:57.812
Ready when you are.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.539
You were drinking every day?

02:11.612 --> 02:13.291
Yes.

02:13.292 --> 02:15.571
Prime Minister, did you know?

02:15.572 --> 02:19.211
No. I was away, I was working.

02:19.212 --> 02:22.460
As a father, I let my son down.

02:24.012 --> 02:27.411
Prime Minister, did you cover up
your son's internet searches?

02:27.412 --> 02:30.451
Let me be clear, there was no cover-up.

02:30.452 --> 02:32.251
My son made a mistake

02:32.252 --> 02:36.211
and he was treated the same way
as other people in his situation.

02:36.212 --> 02:38.451
MI5 agents interviewed your son?

02:38.452 --> 02:40.811
They discussed the incident with him,

02:40.812 --> 02:43.371
the security services
logged the incident.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.771
No further action was taken,

02:44.772 --> 02:47.972
as no further action was taken
in other cases of this kind.

02:49.537 --> 02:53.140
And, Saif, um... if I can
come back to you?

02:53.852 --> 02:55.332
What happened that night?

02:56.572 --> 02:58.171
I'd been drinking.

02:58.524 --> 03:00.724
I was browsing the internet.

03:02.172 --> 03:04.692
What exactly did you type
into the search engine?

03:07.292 --> 03:08.720
Kafir...

03:09.372 --> 03:11.220
...which means unbeliever.

03:12.532 --> 03:15.011
As a description of myself,

03:15.012 --> 03:17.411
my own struggles with my faith,

03:17.412 --> 03:20.300
not as an insult to anyone else.

03:23.372 --> 03:26.532
I, er... I clicked on a link...

03:27.852 --> 03:31.211
...and it was about
the downfall of democracy

03:31.212 --> 03:34.251
and the introduction of a caliphate.

03:34.252 --> 03:36.532
And can you explain what a caliphate is?

03:41.720 --> 03:43.640
Er... a state...

03:44.812 --> 03:47.772
...governed in accordance
with Islamic law.

03:48.812 --> 03:52.052
Was there content calling for
the death of non-Muslims?

03:59.532 --> 04:00.572
Yes.

04:08.132 --> 04:11.011
You've managed to confirm
the prejudices and stereotypes

04:11.012 --> 04:14.091
I've spent my entire life
trying to destroy!

04:14.092 --> 04:15.611
I made a mistake.

04:15.612 --> 04:19.451
We're not allowed mistakes.
We don't get second chances.

04:19.452 --> 04:22.011
Our fuck-ups are not forgiven!

04:22.012 --> 04:23.411
Weren't you young once?

04:23.412 --> 04:25.252
I wasn't allowed to be!

04:26.492 --> 04:28.700
Why didn't you keep Max on our side?

04:30.812 --> 04:33.651
You thought you didn't need him any more.

04:33.652 --> 04:37.091
Well, look at what he's done to us,
to our family.

04:37.092 --> 04:39.651
Max had nothing on me.

04:39.652 --> 04:41.740
I gave him nothing!

04:42.892 --> 04:45.331
But you, my son...!

04:45.332 --> 04:47.931
That's enough!

04:47.932 --> 04:51.852
If she wins, she'll undo everything
my government has tried to achieved.

04:54.292 --> 04:55.652
My legacy.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.252
And YOU let her rip it all down.

05:01.652 --> 05:04.212
That was the point, wasn't it?

05:09.972 --> 05:12.131
Why did we even do the interview?

05:12.132 --> 05:15.772
Because you have to try and hope
that the public sees the real you.

05:18.612 --> 05:20.531
And who is the real me, Dad?

05:20.532 --> 05:23.660
A jealous boy who couldn't deal
with his father's success.

05:24.732 --> 05:28.252
Show them that boy. Show them him
and they'll understand.

05:29.892 --> 05:31.412
Not a bad boy.

05:33.092 --> 05:34.531
Just a weak one.

05:34.532 --> 05:36.091
Hm!

05:36.092 --> 05:37.492
You sound like Max.

05:39.452 --> 05:42.972
You sound... just like him!

05:51.892 --> 05:54.500
During the interview, I didn't hear...

05:55.852 --> 05:58.572
The Prime Minister's wife, Ayesha,
she didn't say a word.

06:00.012 --> 06:02.212
- Have somebody write it up.
- Huh!

06:03.292 --> 06:04.537
You disagree?

06:04.562 --> 06:06.804
She wasn't silenced, she was overwhelmed.

06:08.132 --> 06:10.040
Our readers can make up their own minds.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.331
They're down, Max.

06:11.332 --> 06:12.700
The family's down.

06:13.692 --> 06:15.012
Is that how you see it?

06:16.492 --> 06:18.332
A case of bad sportsmanship?

06:19.652 --> 06:22.131
She didn't say a word
in defence of her son.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.580
I don't know why.

06:24.412 --> 06:26.420
Her husband spoke plenty.

06:28.012 --> 06:30.051
Include the video.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.938
And I want a woman to write it.

06:32.932 --> 06:34.172
Yes, Max.

06:35.972 --> 06:37.611
OK.

06:38.175 --> 06:39.415
They're ready.

06:42.693 --> 06:43.933
Let's go.

07:00.852 --> 07:03.932
Sorry, this isn't working.
Could you run that through? Thanks.

07:07.212 --> 07:08.852
You don't work here any more.

07:12.012 --> 07:14.371
- Let me speak to Lauren.
- That's not going to be possible.

07:14.372 --> 07:15.580
Why not?

07:16.292 --> 07:18.420
Because she's the one who fired you.

07:36.572 --> 07:39.091
Good morning. Thomas, how are you doing?

07:39.092 --> 07:42.811
Hey, guys. How you been? You all right?

07:42.812 --> 07:43.852
OK.

07:45.972 --> 07:47.611
Excuse me.

07:47.612 --> 07:51.291
OK. Can everyone see me?
Come in, come in a little closer.

07:51.740 --> 07:53.531
We'll just have a little talk.

07:53.532 --> 07:55.611
Let me ask you a question.

07:55.612 --> 07:57.371
Who do you work for?

07:57.900 --> 08:00.531
It's all right, don't be shy,
you can tell me.

08:00.532 --> 08:02.251
Who... who do you work for?

08:02.252 --> 08:04.171
We work for you.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.171
You work for me.

08:06.172 --> 08:08.611
For me? No. No, you don't. You don't.

08:08.612 --> 08:10.331
Who am I? I'm nobody.

08:10.332 --> 08:12.052
I'm just somebody passing through.

08:15.132 --> 08:17.012
You work for the news!

08:19.212 --> 08:21.180
We all work for the news!

08:22.132 --> 08:26.540
After 40 years of being a newsman,
the TRUTH...

08:28.652 --> 08:30.931
...has always been enough.
I didn't need anything else.

08:30.932 --> 08:32.731
I didn't need a lie.

08:32.732 --> 08:36.340
The truth can break a man's reputation.

08:37.932 --> 08:40.010
It's a solemn responsibility.

08:40.011 --> 08:41.571
And we have another one,

08:41.572 --> 08:44.420
to not let anyone take our reputation.

08:45.772 --> 08:47.411
Without it, we're done.

08:47.412 --> 08:50.091
As a news organisation,
we are finished! Finished!

08:50.092 --> 08:52.012
All of this, done! Gone!

08:54.292 --> 08:57.571
Over the next couple of days,

08:57.572 --> 09:02.260
you'll notice that some of
your colleagues won't be returning.

09:03.652 --> 09:07.060
Some of the practices that were
taking place during my son's tenure

09:07.612 --> 09:09.092
were unacceptable!

09:11.492 --> 09:14.932
An internal investigation has begun.
Come on in.

09:19.812 --> 09:21.700
Now, one more thing.

09:22.132 --> 09:24.491
Whatever it takes to defend the news,

09:24.492 --> 09:27.260
whatever it takes to defend
this organisation...

09:29.372 --> 09:31.052
...no-one is out of reach!

09:33.612 --> 09:36.171
You're going to accuse him of what?

09:36.172 --> 09:39.700
Blackmail, theft, illegal surveillance.

09:40.452 --> 09:42.451
On what evidence?

09:42.452 --> 09:44.060
Caden's confession.

09:45.812 --> 09:49.051
Max is going to print stories
about me, about this family.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.180
No, he won't.

09:53.812 --> 09:57.011
Because you won't do this, you won't.

09:57.012 --> 09:58.971
- I forbid it.
- You forbid it?

09:58.972 --> 10:01.931
- You marry him against my wishes...
- Everyone was against your wishes.

10:01.932 --> 10:04.411
You brought this man in
from outside into our family,

10:04.412 --> 10:06.571
you build him up,
now you want to tear him down?

10:06.572 --> 10:08.171
That's not it.

10:08.172 --> 10:11.771
Picking a fight with one of
the most powerful men in the world,

10:11.772 --> 10:13.971
- it's vain.
- Vain?

10:13.972 --> 10:16.820
Or is it because he married
a beautiful Mexican woman?

10:17.412 --> 10:18.971
Well, what is it, then?

10:18.972 --> 10:22.091
Is it a principled stand
against power and corruption?

10:22.092 --> 10:25.060
Oh, please! What are you, 13 years old?

10:26.812 --> 10:28.131
Has it never occurred to you

10:28.132 --> 10:30.331
that you're still very much
in love with him?

10:30.332 --> 10:32.251
And then I remember the divorce.

10:32.252 --> 10:34.611
And he won that fight, too.

10:34.612 --> 10:36.412
Rather easily, as I recall.

10:40.492 --> 10:41.852
Mum?

10:44.774 --> 10:46.654
What does he have on us?

10:48.780 --> 10:50.611
Affairs?

10:51.180 --> 10:52.820
These weren't affairs.

10:55.372 --> 10:56.971
What, then?

10:57.385 --> 10:59.665
The women worked for him.

11:01.092 --> 11:02.532
You knew?

11:03.732 --> 11:05.171
I covered it up.

11:05.172 --> 11:07.891
I paid them off,
I found them new employment,

11:07.892 --> 11:10.980
I... tidied up after him.

11:12.652 --> 11:14.051
How many?

11:14.052 --> 11:15.572
Women or years?

11:18.148 --> 11:20.108
We'd be disgraced.

11:22.652 --> 11:26.611
There's a reason your father
never touched you.

11:26.612 --> 11:28.491
I forbade it.

11:28.492 --> 11:31.091
I didn't trust him,
not even with his own daughter.

11:31.092 --> 11:35.211
- Would he...?
- I never gave him the chance.

11:35.212 --> 11:37.491
I told him, if I ever saw him

11:37.492 --> 11:39.851
so much as put an arm around your waist,

11:39.852 --> 11:43.180
I would burn this house to the
ground with him sleeping in it.

11:47.652 --> 11:48.851
Let him be disgraced.

11:48.852 --> 11:51.180
No! No, he has gone!

11:51.892 --> 11:54.331
He's got away with it,
but I'm still here.

11:54.332 --> 11:57.051
I'll have to live with it,
I'll be disgraced.

11:57.052 --> 11:59.291
You are playing with people, Kathryn.

11:59.292 --> 12:00.931
Max is going to lie.

12:00.932 --> 12:03.611
He's going to imply that I'm
the reason that Caden was an addict.

12:03.612 --> 12:06.771
He is going to paint me
as the worst mother imaginable.

12:06.772 --> 12:09.851
Don't tell me I've got nothing to lose.

12:09.852 --> 12:11.692
I'm just as scared as you.

12:30.452 --> 12:32.011
You keep asking me the same question,

12:32.012 --> 12:34.051
hoping I'm going to give
you a different answer.

12:34.052 --> 12:35.771
I'm not here for us.

12:35.772 --> 12:38.331
- What are you here for?
- To warn you.

12:38.332 --> 12:40.131
- About what?
- My dad.

12:40.132 --> 12:42.411
I'm not running for Prime Minister.

12:42.412 --> 12:45.571
He's going to hurt
the people close to me.

12:45.572 --> 12:47.580
I'm not close to you!

12:48.572 --> 12:51.180
- He knows that isn't true.
- It is true.

12:52.292 --> 12:56.131
We're not a couple, we're nothing.
Just... tell him!

12:56.132 --> 12:58.291
I'll tell him, but he knows.

12:58.292 --> 12:59.891
Knows what?!

12:59.892 --> 13:01.651
How much you mean to me.

13:01.652 --> 13:02.896
Stop talking like that!

13:02.921 --> 13:04.620
- Like what?
- Like we're in love!

13:23.892 --> 13:25.252
We'll be fine.

13:29.401 --> 13:31.081
We will be fine.

13:54.153 --> 13:56.433
You report back to Max on my son.

14:01.532 --> 14:03.132
On our conversations?

14:05.492 --> 14:08.860
He's Caden's father, and... he hired me.

14:09.852 --> 14:12.411
He'd ask questions. I didn't think
I was doing anything wrong.

14:12.412 --> 14:13.931
Caden trusted you.

14:13.932 --> 14:15.931
You were his ONLY friend.

14:15.932 --> 14:17.251
I am his friend.

14:17.252 --> 14:19.331
What did Max want to know?

14:19.332 --> 14:21.451
How's my son doing?

14:21.452 --> 14:25.380
What does he eat?
How's his rehab programme?

14:26.372 --> 14:30.420
Or did he ask, "What are they
talking about...

14:31.412 --> 14:33.212
"..him and his mum?

14:34.332 --> 14:37.820
"Does he mutter anything?
Say anything unusual?"

14:39.372 --> 14:42.331
Don't tell me you didn't know
it was spying.

14:42.332 --> 14:45.012
Don't tell me
you didn't know it was wrong.

14:47.332 --> 14:49.612
No. I'm sorry.

14:53.332 --> 14:55.092
Max ruins many good men.

14:57.309 --> 14:58.829
So...

15:00.652 --> 15:04.331
...I want to thank you
for all your hard work.

15:04.332 --> 15:05.891
Well, can't we fix this?

15:05.892 --> 15:07.531
I am fixing this.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.291
- Caden means a lot to me.
- You mean a lot to him.

15:10.292 --> 15:12.451
I want to see his recovery through.

15:12.452 --> 15:14.051
That won't be possible.

15:14.052 --> 15:16.700
- It would be much better for him...
- Don't you dare.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.811
If I apologise to him...

15:21.812 --> 15:23.452
He'll accept.

15:29.366 --> 15:31.686
But you're not going to apologise to him.

16:43.772 --> 16:45.531
- Hello.
- Maggie?

16:45.532 --> 16:47.252
- Yeah.
- It's Kathryn.

16:49.612 --> 16:51.532
I've spoken to my son.

16:54.092 --> 16:55.771
We'll talk to you.

16:55.772 --> 16:59.500
And what will you say, when you talk?

17:01.092 --> 17:02.492
What will you tell us?

17:03.932 --> 17:06.131
Everything.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.252
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:37.972 --> 17:40.500
- Angela Howard?
- Yeah.

17:45.892 --> 17:47.731
Angela Howard is inviting you

17:47.732 --> 17:51.491
to be a part of her election
campaign as a consultant.

17:51.492 --> 17:54.131
- She admires my charity work.
- Ah.

17:54.132 --> 17:57.171
She is requesting your company
at one of the political rallies

17:57.172 --> 18:00.131
and would... like to discuss further...

18:00.132 --> 18:02.012
My God, she's something!

18:05.532 --> 18:07.052
I'm going to go.

18:08.012 --> 18:10.611
- Why?!
- I want to hear what she has to say.

18:10.612 --> 18:12.172
- Mum!
- Only because...

18:13.332 --> 18:14.691
I don't know.

18:14.692 --> 18:16.851
There might be chance,

18:17.203 --> 18:18.883
a small chance...

18:19.772 --> 18:22.412
It's about me. And the work...

18:24.519 --> 18:25.919
...and the ideas.

18:35.692 --> 18:37.132
Then you should go.

18:49.732 --> 18:51.932
Would you like a leaflet?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.772
Excuse me.

19:04.812 --> 19:06.731
Kali Elgood.

19:06.732 --> 19:08.212
Erm...

19:12.695 --> 19:14.535
I have a meeting with Angela Howard.

19:18.332 --> 19:19.692
Can you check that?

19:23.972 --> 19:27.891
My parents used to take their summer
holidays at seaside towns like this.

19:27.892 --> 19:29.820
They never travelled abroad.

19:30.892 --> 19:33.851
If someone had told my mum
and my dad that they were poor,

19:33.852 --> 19:36.812
they would've said, "That might
be true, but we don't feel it."

19:38.172 --> 19:39.612
My school was good.

19:41.612 --> 19:45.171
Our local library was full of books,
our hospital was clean.

19:45.172 --> 19:49.091
There were good houses, good shops.
There were communities. We ate well.

19:49.092 --> 19:51.980
Yeah, we were poor, yes,
but we didn't feel it.

19:53.692 --> 19:57.371
I can't look back and feel
the same nostalgia that you do.

19:57.372 --> 20:00.131
What if you could take
what was great about the past

20:00.132 --> 20:03.051
and mix it with what's great about today?

20:03.052 --> 20:05.412
Cos the past doesn't have
to be old-fashioned.

20:08.732 --> 20:10.172
I don't recognise it.

20:11.212 --> 20:12.692
It hasn't been built yet.

20:13.987 --> 20:15.267
What is it?

20:16.630 --> 20:18.110
My manifesto.

20:19.270 --> 20:21.590
People are bored of sentences,
don't you think?

20:22.332 --> 20:23.691
Sentences?

20:23.692 --> 20:25.851
Words, promises, claims, predictions,

20:25.852 --> 20:27.980
statistics, wrapped up in a...

20:29.212 --> 20:31.251
...neatly bound book that no-one reads,

20:31.252 --> 20:33.980
except a few political journalists.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.852
So you're not going to publish
a manifesto?

20:39.932 --> 20:42.980
I'm going to show the voters
this model of a city.

20:43.412 --> 20:45.091
I'm going to tour it round the country.

20:45.092 --> 20:47.140
Something they can see and touch.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.568
Something they can turn into reality...

20:55.532 --> 20:57.292
...if they vote for me.

20:58.902 --> 21:00.662
A new town?

21:01.852 --> 21:04.020
- A new way of life.
- Where?

21:04.932 --> 21:08.492
Not one. Across the country.

21:09.892 --> 21:11.851
In the most deprived areas,

21:11.852 --> 21:14.372
where there hasn't been
any development for years.

21:15.572 --> 21:17.211
Who gets to live there?

21:17.212 --> 21:18.452
People who contribute.

21:23.092 --> 21:26.051
I know what you're thinking,
but you're wrong.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.411
I don't see race or gender or religion,

21:28.412 --> 21:30.812
I don't care about sexuality.
All I see...

21:31.710 --> 21:34.900
...are lines. Borders.

21:35.172 --> 21:38.412
Who's inside and who's outside.

21:40.332 --> 21:43.491
I'm for the people inside.
That's it, that's all I'm about.

21:43.874 --> 21:46.474
Are you inside or outside?

21:51.492 --> 21:53.460
Angela, can I just show you something?

22:14.319 --> 22:15.439
Are you a paedophile?

22:17.732 --> 22:19.171
Why aren't you at school?

22:19.172 --> 22:20.931
I'm a fuck-up.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.771
Who told you that?

22:23.053 --> 22:24.093
My dad.

22:27.526 --> 22:29.086
What you doing?

22:31.305 --> 22:32.465
Going to see my mum.

22:33.745 --> 22:36.545
I want to tell her something
before she finds out herself.

22:38.692 --> 22:40.180
Your dad's wrong.

22:40.772 --> 22:44.740
I know plenty of fuck-ups.
You're not one of 'em.

24:01.692 --> 24:03.740
I stole from you, Mum.

24:05.399 --> 24:06.679
I know.

24:11.892 --> 24:13.212
You know?

24:14.572 --> 24:16.012
I knew at the time.

24:17.412 --> 24:21.492
When you were stealing and saying
it was the markets.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.200
I'm your mother.

24:25.692 --> 24:29.380
I've listened to you lie
more times than I can count.

24:32.412 --> 24:34.291
I can't make it right, Mum.

24:34.292 --> 24:35.932
I never cared about the money.

24:38.558 --> 24:40.078
I thought you were dead.

24:41.092 --> 24:43.331
Cos that's the only explanation.

24:43.332 --> 24:47.300
My son wouldn't treat me like this.

24:48.252 --> 24:49.772
I was sick, Mum.

24:51.692 --> 24:53.412
I asked the police to look for you.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.931
It's been four years, not a word!

24:59.500 --> 25:01.891
If I'd have stayed in contact, Mum,

25:01.892 --> 25:04.211
I'd have stolen everything you had.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.452
You could've had it...

25:08.132 --> 25:11.132
...if you'd stayed. But...

25:12.492 --> 25:13.652
...you...

25:16.212 --> 25:17.932
...you broke my heart.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.120
I broke my mine, too.

25:54.652 --> 25:56.172
We agreed.

25:57.812 --> 26:00.860
One day, we'd stop working.

26:02.052 --> 26:05.220
We'd travel, you and me.

26:06.772 --> 26:08.740
I thought we'd have more time.

26:10.732 --> 26:13.011
You were never going to stop.

26:13.379 --> 26:14.859
Did you want me to?

26:15.772 --> 26:17.291
I only ever wanted you.

26:28.772 --> 26:30.172
Sorry you lost your job.

26:31.092 --> 26:33.252
We can get by. We're OK.

26:34.572 --> 26:36.491
Your husband is about to be

26:36.492 --> 26:40.172
one of the most famous journalists
in the country.

26:41.412 --> 26:42.812
Come on.

26:49.412 --> 26:52.220
- You spoke to Caden?
- I spoke to his mum.

26:53.812 --> 27:00.331
And Max's son, once heir to
his empire, wants to dish the dirt,

27:00.332 --> 27:04.180
in public, on record, on his father.

27:06.412 --> 27:08.091
Fuck!

27:08.092 --> 27:09.491
Fuck indeed.

27:09.492 --> 27:12.771
That's great, right? That's all you need.

27:12.772 --> 27:14.411
Thank you.

27:14.412 --> 27:17.411
But Max is going to attack his
credibility. We know what he'll say.

27:17.412 --> 27:19.931
"He's a... a burn-out, a coke head.

27:19.932 --> 27:21.811
"He's in hospital, shitting in his bed,

27:21.812 --> 27:24.491
"learning to write his own name,"
that kind of thing.

27:24.492 --> 27:26.252
I agree, that's the attack.

27:27.212 --> 27:30.940
Doesn't change the fact,
this is his son...

27:31.812 --> 27:34.091
...with all his daddy's secrets.

27:34.092 --> 27:37.051
And his confession will be covered
across the world.

27:37.052 --> 27:40.171
And the public,
who normally don't give a shit,

27:40.172 --> 27:44.371
will suck up the family-fucked-up
drama of it all.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.091
Do we trust Kathryn?

27:46.092 --> 27:50.091
She's a bored aristocrat who's tried
everything. Painting, photography.

27:50.092 --> 27:52.771
Maybe doing the right thing
is just another fad.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.331
I don't trust her either.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.251
What does that matter?

27:56.252 --> 27:58.771
I don't know what her reasons are.
I don't care.

27:58.772 --> 28:01.091
We were at a dead-end.

28:01.092 --> 28:03.851
We knew everything, could prove nothing.

28:03.852 --> 28:05.531
Hm.

28:05.532 --> 28:07.100
We've been given a gift...

28:09.028 --> 28:10.988
...dropped from the gods.

28:13.972 --> 28:18.491
Kathryn is being much more careful
about the way that she communicates.

28:18.492 --> 28:20.411
Mm.

28:20.580 --> 28:22.811
No voicemails, no e-mails.

28:22.812 --> 28:24.932
Oh, I don't think we can blame her
for that.

28:26.212 --> 28:27.852
She's set up an interview.

28:29.412 --> 28:30.891
Who'd she pick?

28:31.102 --> 28:33.222
Some dyke called Maggie Barns.

28:35.932 --> 28:37.731
Why do you talk like that?

28:37.732 --> 28:39.091
Like what?

28:39.092 --> 28:40.492
I don't like it!

28:42.052 --> 28:43.692
I apologise.

28:46.612 --> 28:50.340
Some... lesbian called Maggie Barns.

28:52.292 --> 28:54.891
Maggie. Smart choice.

28:54.892 --> 28:56.571
- Yeah. She's brilliant.
- Yes.

28:56.572 --> 28:57.932
She's also very ill.

28:59.412 --> 29:00.851
I didn't know.

29:00.852 --> 29:03.651
When she speaks out against us,
against her own paper,

29:03.652 --> 29:05.571
an award-winning journalist,

29:05.572 --> 29:08.411
sick, frail, no hair, no make-up...

29:08.412 --> 29:09.852
Very powerful.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.132
Find out when that interview is.

29:33.910 --> 29:35.510
There's a man.

29:44.231 --> 29:46.791
I'm responsible for his death.

29:48.886 --> 29:50.606
What happened?

29:52.892 --> 29:56.971
There's a tribunal,
and they say there's new information

29:56.972 --> 29:59.451
and new evidence about...

29:59.452 --> 30:02.292
about my, um... about my actions.

30:05.532 --> 30:07.931
It can't be because of my dad.

30:07.932 --> 30:10.691
So, what, you think this is
a fucking coincidence, do you?!

30:10.692 --> 30:13.411
No, that isn't what I'm s-saying.
I don't know.

30:13.412 --> 30:16.411
A man died and it was my fault!

30:16.412 --> 30:18.100
I am responsible!

30:24.452 --> 30:25.972
OK.

30:27.652 --> 30:29.172
OK?

30:30.452 --> 30:31.780
I'll love you.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.091
What?

30:34.092 --> 30:35.971
- I'll love you.
- No.

30:35.972 --> 30:38.091
- I'll try.
- What are you doing?!

30:38.092 --> 30:39.891
- Your father, he's behind this.
- No!

30:39.892 --> 30:41.651
He's responsible. Just make him stop.

30:41.652 --> 30:43.051
Make him stop the investigation.

30:43.052 --> 30:44.811
I'll love you! Please!

30:44.812 --> 30:46.971
- Can you make him stop?
- No!

30:46.972 --> 30:49.251
Make him stop, make him stop.

30:49.252 --> 30:51.651
Make him stop, please make him stop.

30:51.652 --> 30:53.451
- Orla!
- You can have me!

30:53.452 --> 30:55.040
- Will you please...?!
- Please stop!

30:55.065 --> 30:56.099
- Please!
- Stop!

30:56.100 --> 30:57.116
- Make him stop!
- Stop!

30:57.141 --> 30:58.291
Make him stop! Just make him stop!
- Stop!

30:58.292 --> 30:59.931
- Make him stop! Make him stop!
- Stop!

30:59.932 --> 31:02.451
- Stop!
- I'll love you! I'll love you! I'll love you!

31:02.452 --> 31:04.691
Make him stop, Caden!
Just make him stop, please!

31:04.692 --> 31:06.411
Please!

31:41.812 --> 31:44.700
- Como estas? How are you, guys?
- How was your flight?

31:44.701 --> 31:46.691
- Zoe, please, if you...
- THEY SPEAK SPANISH

31:46.692 --> 31:47.967
Hey!

31:49.252 --> 31:50.572
Hola.

31:53.812 --> 31:56.371
Oh, look at you! Hey! Oh!

31:56.372 --> 31:57.852
Mmm!

32:00.732 --> 32:04.851
Since you don't come to me,
I must come to you.

32:04.852 --> 32:07.651
Well, events have run away from me.

32:07.652 --> 32:10.700
It is time we made our home.

32:12.652 --> 32:13.852
Yes.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.932
I was passing through
La Plaza de la Constitucion.

32:20.692 --> 32:22.571
It was late.

32:22.572 --> 32:25.131
The square was almost empty,

32:25.940 --> 32:28.691
but in the centre, you know, by the flag?

32:28.692 --> 32:30.891
- Yeah, I know.
- There was a clown.

32:30.892 --> 32:33.651
- Ah.
- Juggling.

32:33.652 --> 32:37.291
I thought, "Who is he juggling for?"
He was the only person there.

32:37.292 --> 32:39.492
What were you doing at the parliament?

32:43.332 --> 32:44.971
Catching up with friends.

32:44.972 --> 32:46.140
Oh.

32:47.420 --> 32:49.100
Were they asking questions?

32:49.812 --> 32:51.252
They're curious.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.372
About me?

32:56.052 --> 33:00.331
About this politician
you're championing, Ang-ela Howard.

33:00.332 --> 33:02.491
- Angela.
- Angela Howard.

33:02.492 --> 33:04.891
She's not loved.

33:05.460 --> 33:06.660
Abroad, no.

33:07.492 --> 33:09.692
No, she's not. At home, yes.

33:11.812 --> 33:15.211
I asked myself,
"What would I do if your new papers

33:15.212 --> 33:19.020
"supported a Mexican candidate
that I despised?"

33:21.292 --> 33:24.371
Despised is a very strong word, honey.

33:24.372 --> 33:26.372
I know the word's strength.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.731
You understand,

33:30.732 --> 33:35.331
my business life must remain
separate from my home life?

33:35.332 --> 33:37.211
You understand...

33:37.212 --> 33:41.451
...I cannot separate our personal
lives from our professional lives.

33:41.452 --> 33:45.171
I won't be told what decisions
to make by anyone.

33:45.172 --> 33:48.731
Max, you tell the whole world
what decisions to make.

33:48.732 --> 33:51.611
No, I don't. No, that's wrong.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.900
No. I'm a listener.

33:54.812 --> 33:59.772
I listen. The world tells me
what decisions it's about to make.

34:00.932 --> 34:02.651
I just hear it before anyone else.

34:02.652 --> 34:05.211
So you can sit there,
on the edge of my bath,

34:05.212 --> 34:08.411
looking at me,
but I can't look at you, is that it?

34:08.411 --> 34:10.810
You want me to leave?

34:10.811 --> 34:14.091
I just want to sit on the edge
of your bath, asking you questions

34:14.092 --> 34:16.130
about who you meet and what they say.

34:16.132 --> 34:18.371
- It wouldn't work, I take showers.
- You lock the door.

34:18.371 --> 34:20.011
Have you tried to get in?

34:20.012 --> 34:23.650
Am I allowed to wander in
and talk to you while you shower?

34:23.652 --> 34:25.251
Right, I'll unlock the door.

34:25.252 --> 34:27.531
You can come talk to me
in the shower if you want.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.972
I can't promise it'll be
very interesting, but...

34:32.972 --> 34:34.212
You'll unlock the door?

34:47.139 --> 34:48.532
I'll unlock the door.

34:56.179 --> 34:57.412
Can I interrupt?

35:08.572 --> 35:11.171
I was listening to the radio yesterday,

35:11.172 --> 35:15.211
caught the last few seconds
of the King's College choir.

35:15.212 --> 35:16.820
And I thought to myself,

35:18.040 --> 35:19.320
"What am I doing?"

35:21.290 --> 35:22.770
I'm so proud of you.

35:23.772 --> 35:26.731
- I'm not in the choir, Dad.
- Hm!

35:26.732 --> 35:30.140
No, but you are near them.

35:31.932 --> 35:34.771
Despite all the commotions
and distractions

35:34.772 --> 35:37.980
caused in your life by me.

35:40.452 --> 35:43.091
Don't you have the economy to fix,
or something?

35:43.092 --> 35:45.691
No. Not today.

35:45.692 --> 35:47.852
Today, I am Dad.

35:49.332 --> 35:51.691
When I was first considering running
for election

35:51.692 --> 35:53.092
as a member of Parliament...

35:54.532 --> 35:57.131
...we had a meeting,
where it was discussed

35:57.132 --> 36:00.764
whether I could overcome
both race and religion

36:00.765 --> 36:02.660
from an electoral standpoint.

36:04.492 --> 36:07.011
Well, maybe I couldn't
fight on both fronts.

36:07.012 --> 36:08.971
I wasn't particularly devout,

36:08.972 --> 36:14.580
so they asked me if I would consider
converting to Christianity.

36:15.572 --> 36:18.091
For two weeks, I considered it,

36:18.092 --> 36:20.211
until I told them that I couldn't.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.891
A part of me would die.

36:21.892 --> 36:25.132
My faith, yes, my integrity, my idealism.

36:27.452 --> 36:29.411
I was so ashamed.

36:29.412 --> 36:31.260
I am still ashamed.

36:32.172 --> 36:35.771
No-one ever found out because
in those two weeks of campaigning,

36:35.772 --> 36:38.011
I ducked the question of my faith.

36:38.012 --> 36:40.772
But the truth is, I did consider it.

36:41.972 --> 36:45.811
Now, if anyone ever found out that
I was prepared to drop my faith

36:45.812 --> 36:48.131
to try to further my career,

36:48.444 --> 36:51.284
make myself more appealing,
more electable...

36:53.132 --> 36:55.252
...I would not be the Prime Minister.

36:58.052 --> 36:59.211
Who knows?

36:59.212 --> 37:02.140
Your mother. The people in that room.

37:03.892 --> 37:08.300
I wanted you to know, too. Hm?

37:09.972 --> 37:11.932
Scott?

37:13.898 --> 37:15.178
Scott?

37:24.012 --> 37:26.011
Are you OK?

37:26.012 --> 37:28.331
You know, I was always sure

37:28.332 --> 37:30.612
that my mum wouldn't want
to know me any more.

37:32.820 --> 37:34.260
That I'd lost her.

37:35.671 --> 37:37.860
But some part of me hoped that maybe

37:38.940 --> 37:41.820
one day, we'd make up.

37:43.932 --> 37:45.460
That was my dream,

37:46.196 --> 37:48.196
that I'd be forgiven.

37:49.772 --> 37:51.212
Now I know that'll never happen.

37:52.732 --> 37:54.531
What did she say?

37:54.532 --> 37:58.291
She buried me in the garden
of the house she was forced to sell.

37:58.292 --> 38:00.212
I'm so sorry.

38:02.052 --> 38:04.740
You know, I thought, afterwards...

38:06.652 --> 38:08.180
...maybe I'd want a drink.

38:11.012 --> 38:12.092
But I don't.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.852
That's good. Mm.

38:18.092 --> 38:21.092
I won't survive a... another lie.

38:22.412 --> 38:23.892
I won't survive another drink.

38:27.572 --> 38:32.932
All I have left is love... and loyalty.

38:35.532 --> 38:37.012
I can offer you that.

38:38.732 --> 38:41.692
It's not because I'm a good person,
I just...

38:45.460 --> 38:47.492
I can't afford to be a bad one again.

38:52.492 --> 38:53.732
Kathryn, has...

38:54.932 --> 38:59.412
...has anyone ever been
devoted... to you?

39:00.932 --> 39:04.580
You know, the way... the way
you're devoted to them?

39:09.932 --> 39:11.372
No.

39:16.372 --> 39:18.251
What do you want?

39:18.820 --> 39:21.780
What do you...? What do you
really want, Kathryn?

39:28.172 --> 39:29.692
I want love.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.292
I want kindness.

40:16.976 --> 40:18.216
Pam?

40:19.052 --> 40:20.651
I can't find Orla.

40:20.652 --> 40:22.651
I haven't seen her.

40:22.652 --> 40:24.860
Has the tribunal started?

40:25.692 --> 40:27.331
What tribunal?

40:27.332 --> 40:30.171
The investigation, the hearing.

40:30.172 --> 40:32.931
There was an incident, a-a man died.

40:32.932 --> 40:36.891
She kept talking about new evidence.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.531
You should talk to her.

40:38.532 --> 40:39.900
What's going on?

40:41.692 --> 40:43.572
- You should talk to her.
- Tell me!

40:44.652 --> 40:47.451
I've heard Orla talking about
investigations and tribunals

40:47.452 --> 40:48.812
ever since she arrived here.

40:50.412 --> 40:53.251
I've never heard of there
actually being one.

40:53.252 --> 40:55.060
I don't understand.

40:56.452 --> 40:57.772
She's not well.

40:59.332 --> 41:00.891
It's not real.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.651
No, you're wrong.

41:03.652 --> 41:06.500
She was in my room, she was scared.

41:07.812 --> 41:09.652
It was real, I saw it.

41:11.869 --> 41:13.349
Surviving is hard.

41:16.637 --> 41:21.477
In 1980, it took a family four years
to save for a deposit.

41:22.452 --> 41:25.091
It now takes 19 years.

41:25.092 --> 41:27.731
While renting, they spend more,

41:27.732 --> 41:30.772
live with less, put up with worse.

41:31.852 --> 41:33.732
You know all this,
you've written about it.

41:35.212 --> 41:37.011
And nothing gets done.

41:37.012 --> 41:41.571
Politicians have failed
in their most basic duties.

41:49.492 --> 41:51.732
I'd like to introduce my first speaker.

41:52.772 --> 41:55.623
A woman who has dedicated her life

41:55.624 --> 41:58.292
to addressing the issue
of social housing.

42:10.772 --> 42:13.172
The sky is beautiful today.

42:22.012 --> 42:26.811
And may I say,
no-one will be left behind.

42:31.292 --> 42:32.612
It's OK.

42:36.892 --> 42:39.380
I've spent several days...

42:41.252 --> 42:44.732
...observing Angela Howard's campaign.

42:46.758 --> 42:48.118
I can say this...

42:50.231 --> 42:51.351
...I'm scared.

42:53.052 --> 42:56.891
She plans on running this country

42:56.892 --> 42:58.580
like she's the owner of it.

42:59.532 --> 43:02.051
Like it's one of her...

43:02.052 --> 43:04.131
Like it's one of her businesses!

43:04.132 --> 43:07.891
If you agree with her,
then she's your best friend!

43:07.892 --> 43:09.400
If you disagree...

43:09.425 --> 43:10.931
- Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

43:16.332 --> 43:19.860
Well... it would seem...

43:20.652 --> 43:22.691
...I haven't yet won her vote.

43:24.212 --> 43:26.651
But I don't want to stifle disagreement.

43:26.652 --> 43:30.491
Kali's right, I am going to run
this country as a business.

43:30.492 --> 43:34.131
And I'm going to turn this
business around.

43:43.852 --> 43:45.731
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes, I'm sure.

43:45.732 --> 43:48.291
If you change your mind
at any point, we stop it.

43:48.292 --> 43:49.891
Maggie.

43:50.157 --> 43:51.836
Good to see you again.

43:51.861 --> 43:53.541
I'm Nick Caplan.

43:54.532 --> 43:56.051
I know your work.

43:56.052 --> 43:57.891
He started the investigation.

43:57.892 --> 43:59.771
I remember.

43:59.772 --> 44:02.891
The murder, the private investigator.

44:02.892 --> 44:04.532
A robbery gone wrong.

44:06.492 --> 44:07.972
I know who killed him.

44:09.532 --> 44:13.092
He was, er... blackmailing your papers.

44:17.172 --> 44:21.091
Some might say our circumstances
have not improved.

44:21.092 --> 44:23.171
Speak for yourself.

44:23.172 --> 44:24.460
Yes.

44:25.247 --> 44:26.887
You've changed.

44:29.932 --> 44:34.212
I want to say... I'm sorry.

44:36.250 --> 44:39.010
I was wrong and you were right.

44:40.612 --> 44:42.891
I can't speak for the others.

44:42.892 --> 44:46.140
Maybe when they read this,
they will, too, but I forgive you.

44:48.590 --> 44:50.070
That means a lot.

44:57.292 --> 45:00.332
The question I wanted answering
was never about you.

45:02.231 --> 45:03.791
It was about your daughter.

45:07.492 --> 45:09.052
What does she really think?

45:10.532 --> 45:12.372
Max trusts her, but I wasn't sure.

45:14.012 --> 45:15.931
Now I know.

45:15.932 --> 45:18.612
My daughter had no idea
what I was going to do.

45:19.612 --> 45:22.211
Oh, no-one cares about your protest.
No-one's going to cover it.

45:22.626 --> 45:23.986
You've achieved nothing.

45:25.013 --> 45:26.773
I've said no to you.

45:27.612 --> 45:29.452
Someone stood up and said no.

45:34.332 --> 45:36.171
That was me.

45:36.172 --> 45:38.331
I wanted to be the first to do it.

45:38.332 --> 45:39.972
Lots of people are going to say no.

45:41.372 --> 45:43.572
A lot more are going to say yes.

45:44.572 --> 45:45.732
The statue.

45:47.532 --> 45:49.371
I'm sorry?

45:49.372 --> 45:50.931
Who is it?

45:50.932 --> 45:54.932
Who is the statue of,
in the model of your new city?

45:58.029 --> 45:59.309
It's you, isn't it?

46:01.132 --> 46:05.131
You're desperately searching
for something bad, when there isn't.

46:05.132 --> 46:07.291
Do you know what that is?

46:07.620 --> 46:08.931
It's prejudice.

46:09.140 --> 46:10.692
You're an authoritarian.

46:12.212 --> 46:15.291
I don't care how many houses you build,

46:15.292 --> 46:17.132
or how many jobs you create.

46:28.092 --> 46:29.572
Get her out.

46:31.132 --> 46:32.771
Say your name.

46:32.772 --> 46:34.411
Caden Finch.

46:34.740 --> 46:36.331
And again.

46:36.332 --> 46:38.891
My name is Caden Finch.

46:38.892 --> 46:41.371
Son of Max Finch.

46:41.372 --> 46:43.971
Who was, in turn,
the son of Walter Finch.

46:43.972 --> 46:47.731
Three generations of Finches.

46:47.732 --> 46:51.091
Oh, what is this? There we go.

46:51.092 --> 46:54.051
Look, I hope you don't mind me
just dropping in like this.

46:54.052 --> 46:56.211
I wanted to join the discussion.

46:56.212 --> 46:58.900
We are talking about my newspapers,
aren't we?

47:01.412 --> 47:04.012
You should've taken that job
I offered you.

47:05.932 --> 47:08.180
Maggie, I know you're not well.

47:08.772 --> 47:10.060
I'm very sorry.

47:22.492 --> 47:25.100
Let me tell you about my son.

47:39.292 --> 47:41.931
Let me introduce you to someone
very special.

47:41.932 --> 47:43.692
His name's Billy.

47:47.292 --> 47:49.651
He used to sing in his school choir,

47:49.652 --> 47:53.411
until his school could no longer
afford a music teacher.

47:53.412 --> 47:58.932
Now he travels by bus for 40 minutes
each way just so he can sing.

48:00.012 --> 48:02.612
His mum, Sue... Where is Sue?

48:03.652 --> 48:07.340
She wrote to me, asking, "What can I do?"

48:08.812 --> 48:10.412
What can I do?

48:12.612 --> 48:14.371
Right now, nothing.

48:16.951 --> 48:18.191
But...

48:19.917 --> 48:21.500
...if you vote for me...

48:22.252 --> 48:24.451
How did you know
we were having this meeting?

48:24.452 --> 48:27.264
It's my job.
I've been doing this for 40 years,

48:27.265 --> 48:29.292
I'm the best in the world.
That's how I know.

48:30.652 --> 48:33.652
You have the scent of a story,
I can tell.

48:34.612 --> 48:36.492
- Best of my life.
- Hm!

48:38.892 --> 48:41.651
I hear your mother fired Andrew.

48:42.180 --> 48:44.451
He was spying for you.

48:44.452 --> 48:46.611
He was fond of you, that was real.

48:46.612 --> 48:50.371
More importantly, he was one of
the best in the country.

48:50.372 --> 48:51.931
He was getting you better.

48:54.492 --> 48:58.451
But your mother misplaced her anger
for me and put it on him,

48:58.452 --> 49:00.980
which was completely unfair.

49:01.932 --> 49:04.131
The only person who's going
to suffer from that is you.

49:04.132 --> 49:05.851
It won't work.

49:05.852 --> 49:07.651
You can't divide us.

49:07.652 --> 49:10.531
This is the same.
She's taking out her anger on me.

49:10.532 --> 49:13.731
She feels that the world didn't make
her important enough,

49:13.732 --> 49:15.811
and YOU are going to suffer for it.

49:15.812 --> 49:17.140
What's in the file?

49:19.692 --> 49:23.140
After our talk,
I ordered an investigation...

49:24.892 --> 49:27.892
...into our business culture
and practices.

49:29.652 --> 49:31.411
Kathryn was right.

49:31.412 --> 49:34.340
There have been serious issues.

49:35.292 --> 49:37.052
It's in the file.

49:38.812 --> 49:40.412
What does it say?

49:43.852 --> 49:45.411
It says...

49:45.412 --> 49:49.372
I... didn't... know.

49:52.772 --> 49:54.491
- You didn't know?
- I didn't know.

49:54.492 --> 49:55.594
That's a lie.

49:55.619 --> 49:57.522
Caden, I relied on you. You let me down.

49:57.523 --> 50:00.651
They were your newspapers. They were
taking their instructions from you.

50:00.652 --> 50:04.531
No, no, no. Caden was responsible.
He was out of his depth.

50:04.532 --> 50:08.411
He let go of our best journalists,
like Maggie,

50:08.412 --> 50:13.051
because they were expensive,
time-consuming, difficult to manage.

50:13.052 --> 50:14.812
I'm sorry, but you are.

50:15.852 --> 50:18.651
Then he hired dirty-trick
private detectives

50:18.652 --> 50:20.971
who used illegal short cuts

50:20.972 --> 50:24.411
to do what any good journalist
would've done legally.

50:24.412 --> 50:26.212
He was not up to the job.

50:30.612 --> 50:33.652
So he cheated. And that's it,
that's all there is to it.

50:34.772 --> 50:36.652
I'm sorry that I appointed him.

50:38.638 --> 50:41.660
He wasn't ready.
He was just way... way too young.

50:44.119 --> 50:45.239
I made a mistake.

50:48.172 --> 50:49.212
Anyway...

50:53.492 --> 50:55.972
...you have all the evidence
right there, Kathryn.

50:58.852 --> 51:02.811
All you have to do
is hand it over to Maggie.

51:02.812 --> 51:04.492
Hand it over...

51:05.612 --> 51:07.540
...and Caden will go to jail.

51:29.052 --> 51:32.011
This country elected a man

51:32.012 --> 51:36.011
who has lost interest in the country
that elected him.

51:37.372 --> 51:39.971
He struts the global stage,

51:39.972 --> 51:44.931
using your money to solve global poverty.

51:44.932 --> 51:47.891
- What about local poverty?
- APPLAUSE

51:47.892 --> 51:49.931
International aid.

51:49.932 --> 51:52.051
What about regional aid?

51:55.532 --> 51:59.651
Prime Minister, your own people
are living off food banks!

52:01.532 --> 52:03.291
My business is here.

52:03.292 --> 52:05.860
My business is you.

52:06.412 --> 52:09.260
It will only ever be you.

52:09.852 --> 52:11.451
Your buses!

52:11.452 --> 52:13.371
- Your trains!
- Our trains!

52:13.372 --> 52:15.211
- Your schools!
- Our schools!

52:15.212 --> 52:17.571
- Your jobs!
- Our jobs!

52:17.572 --> 52:19.611
- Your churches!
- Our churches!

52:19.612 --> 52:21.451
- Your choirs!
- Our choirs!

52:21.452 --> 52:23.211
Your shops, your high streets,

52:23.212 --> 52:26.051
your playgrounds and parks!

52:26.052 --> 52:29.060
Nothing is too small!

52:29.532 --> 52:35.051
Your problems are never... too... small!

52:36.812 --> 52:39.700
They say you're angry.

52:42.172 --> 52:44.300
I say...

52:44.692 --> 52:46.531
...you're amazing!

52:51.092 --> 52:54.211
♪ Amazing grace ♪

52:54.212 --> 52:58.251
♪ How sweet the sound ♪

52:58.252 --> 53:06.491

53:06.492 --> 53:10.931

53:10.932 --> 53:14.851
♪ But now am found ♪

53:14.852 --> 53:22.651
♪ Was blind, but now I see ♪

53:57.932 --> 53:59.372
Can we speak in private?

54:00.452 --> 54:02.691
You didn't want to speak in private.

54:03.140 --> 54:05.260
You wanted to speak in public.

54:06.772 --> 54:08.492
You wanted a crusade.

54:09.852 --> 54:11.852
You have it. It's in your hands.

54:13.612 --> 54:16.092
And you have the perfect messenger
in Maggie.

54:18.234 --> 54:19.474
So go ahead.

54:20.732 --> 54:23.091
Go ahead, get it over with.
Give her the report.

54:23.092 --> 54:25.251
You built up this whole structure,
didn't you?

54:25.252 --> 54:27.972
So if it ever came crashing down,
it would only destroy your son!

54:29.273 --> 54:30.913
Didn't you?

54:32.801 --> 54:34.241
I didn't know.

54:42.012 --> 54:43.492
Saif!

55:06.212 --> 55:07.732
I'm OK, I'm OK!
