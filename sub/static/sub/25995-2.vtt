WEBVTT

00:00.020 --> 00:02.206
Sergeant David Budd, Metropolitan Police.

00:02.240 --> 00:04.482
British Transport Police have
put out an alert on a possible

00:04.483 --> 00:07.687
suicide bomber attempting to board
a London-bound service.

00:08.730 --> 00:11.689
Don't do that! Please, don't do
that! Just stay still.

00:13.450 --> 00:14.857
Get down on the ground!

00:14.882 --> 00:18.133
Put your hands on your head
and get down! GET DOWN!

00:18.158 --> 00:20.495
Nadia, stay right there. Don't move.
Please, don't move, Nadia!

00:20.496 --> 00:22.277
- Step out of the toilet!
- No!

00:23.318 --> 00:24.477
OK.

00:24.478 --> 00:26.640
Great job, David, credit to the Branch.

00:26.641 --> 00:28.422
I'm assigning you to a Cabinet Minister.

00:28.447 --> 00:29.877
Very good, ma'am.

00:29.878 --> 00:30.997
Home Secretary,

00:30.998 --> 00:34.172
just how anxious should we be
about this terrorist threat?

00:34.172 --> 00:37.931
Only those intent on acts of
violence have anything to fear.

00:37.932 --> 00:40.817
The Counter-Terrorism and
Security Act 2015

00:40.818 --> 00:43.451
simply does not go far enough.

00:43.452 --> 00:45.211
You're making a move for the leadership.

00:45.212 --> 00:48.131
That interview you did on telly.
Did you mean what you said?

00:48.132 --> 00:49.795
The thing is, David-slash-Dave,

00:49.820 --> 00:52.691
I don't need you to vote for
me, only to protect me.

00:52.692 --> 00:55.861
I can't see any justification
for believing the Taliban

00:55.886 --> 00:58.011
would govern Afghanistan in peace and

00:58.012 --> 01:00.365
harmony, or Isis would ever form a state

01:00.390 --> 01:02.794
with which the world could
have diplomatic relations.

01:02.795 --> 01:06.052
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

01:07.412 --> 01:10.051
...doesn't require
apologising for the past.

01:10.052 --> 01:11.531
You need help, Dave.

01:11.532 --> 01:14.611
Love, I'm sorry,
but we can work through this.

01:14.612 --> 01:15.692
I've met someone.

01:17.052 --> 01:19.011
Shit!

01:19.012 --> 01:22.171
Put "PTSD" on your job application,
who's going to hire you?

01:22.172 --> 01:23.531
You said it out in Helmand.

01:23.532 --> 01:26.091
If you ever found yourself right
beside one of those bastards

01:26.092 --> 01:29.132
that sent us out there, you'd just
close your eyes and pull the trigger.

01:35.879 --> 01:38.599
Like a prince and a princess
getting a lift in, eh?

01:38.732 --> 01:41.564
Everyone else is already in,
so in you go, quickly, all right?

01:42.492 --> 01:45.292
Right. Come on now, Charlie. We had
all that messing about at home.

01:46.092 --> 01:47.731
Let's not make it worse, please.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.140
He says they call him names. He hates it.

01:50.492 --> 01:52.931
What have I told you about crying?
Never show weakness.

01:52.932 --> 01:56.052
They'll only hurt you more.
Right, big man, in you go.

01:56.572 --> 01:58.837
Charlie! In we go, please.

01:59.932 --> 02:01.277
Good boy.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.972 --> 02:34.052
Sorry, ma'am.

02:43.092 --> 02:45.612
Sorry, ma'am, I need
to keep it on for work.

02:52.052 --> 02:54.691
I think you'd better answer that
before it drives us all up the wall.

02:54.692 --> 02:56.291
Apologies, ma'am.

02:56.292 --> 02:58.651
- Hi. Look, I'm...
- 'What were you thinking this morning?

02:58.652 --> 03:01.091
'I just got called in by his
teacher. He's really upset.'

03:01.092 --> 03:02.811
I'm at work. I'll call you back.

03:02.812 --> 03:05.611
- 'Please, don't hang up on me, please!'
- I can't talk right now.

03:05.612 --> 03:08.451
'The special school. They haven't
got a place for Charlie.

03:08.452 --> 03:10.651
'He's got to stay at Heath Bank.'

03:10.652 --> 03:13.364
Shit. Look, I'm working, but we'll
find the person to talk to.

03:13.389 --> 03:14.636
We'll find the right school.

03:16.092 --> 03:17.971
'They've said it'll be at least a year.'

03:17.972 --> 03:19.612
I'm really sorry, love.

03:40.372 --> 03:42.092
Apologies again, ma'am.

03:43.092 --> 03:45.972
- 7-9, Lavender entering the building.
- 'Received.'

04:00.498 --> 04:02.258
- Morning, Sergeant.
- Morning, sir.

04:03.729 --> 04:07.211
Someone screwed up the time? I
thought this conference was at ten.

04:07.212 --> 04:08.496
No, it's still on.

04:08.863 --> 04:10.996
- Some kind of private meeting.
- Oh.

04:19.132 --> 04:20.458
We've acquired intelligence

04:20.483 --> 04:23.011
on a possible terrorist
attack on a London school.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.371
Oh, my God.

04:24.372 --> 04:25.734
The cell's comms are encrypted

04:25.759 --> 04:29.438
but metadata suggests a pattern
of reconnoitring schools.

04:30.892 --> 04:33.011
Feed these through to the police
when they arrive.

04:33.012 --> 04:34.219
Ordinarily I would,

04:34.220 --> 04:38.291
but one of the schools threw up
a link to a serving police officer.

04:38.292 --> 04:41.078
His kids attend. David Budd.

04:45.532 --> 04:47.131
It may be a coincidence.

04:47.132 --> 04:50.904
Yes, it may, or a terrorist cell's
obtained confidential

04:50.905 --> 04:54.550
information on the officer who
foiled the 1st of October attack

04:54.551 --> 04:56.800
and this is their plan for revenge.

04:57.492 --> 05:01.262
In my experience, information leakage
occurs for one of two reasons,

05:01.263 --> 05:05.371
either police officers fail to
communicate securely, or an officer

05:05.372 --> 05:09.103
susceptible to bribery or blackmail
is responsible for the disclosure.

05:12.452 --> 05:16.411
If there's a police leak,
we should keep this to ourselves.

05:16.412 --> 05:17.713
Thank you.

05:18.372 --> 05:21.811
And taking specific steps to protect
the school in question may

05:21.812 --> 05:25.011
redirect the terrorists towards
a different course of action,

05:25.012 --> 05:26.712
action we're unprepared for.

05:27.212 --> 05:30.492
We'll tighten security around the
schools and hold back the reason why.

05:39.132 --> 05:41.251
- Mike.
- Anne.

05:41.252 --> 05:43.331
- Tahir, how are you settling in?
- Great.

05:43.332 --> 05:45.131
Thanks again for bringing me
into the team.

05:45.132 --> 05:47.811
The press have been
editorialising on RIPA-18.

05:47.812 --> 05:51.091
Maybe Tahir could set up an
interview defending the policy.

05:51.092 --> 05:52.743
Couldn't you argue that
defending would only serve

05:52.768 --> 05:54.811
- to validate the criticism?
- I agree.

05:54.812 --> 05:57.131
Since when did we start doing
the Opposition's job for them?

05:57.132 --> 05:58.531
We'd be an improvement.

06:14.732 --> 06:17.331
We all know everyone.

06:17.332 --> 06:21.052
Mike Travis, Minister of State
for Counter-Terrorism.

06:26.412 --> 06:30.011
Stephen Hunter-Dunn, Director-General
of the Security Service,

06:30.012 --> 06:34.092
and Anne Sampson, Commander of MPS
Counter-Terrorism Branch.

06:35.132 --> 06:38.252
So perhaps we could start with
an update on 1/10.

06:44.132 --> 06:47.731
The bomber herself claims to have
been coerced by the husband

06:47.732 --> 06:50.526
and she remains too intimidated
to reveal much.

06:51.692 --> 06:54.171
And who are their accomplices?
Where did they get the bomb?

06:54.172 --> 06:56.531
- What are their targets?
- Inquiries are ongoing.

06:56.532 --> 06:57.772
Clock's ticking.

06:59.012 --> 07:00.971
Maybe my officers would
have more success.

07:00.972 --> 07:02.879
Come off it, Stephen.

07:03.372 --> 07:05.531
We're happy to receive
relevant intelligence,

07:05.532 --> 07:06.771
but it's our investigation.

07:06.772 --> 07:10.389
Look, look. I think we might need
to take a step back, hmm?

07:10.390 --> 07:12.343
Police jurisdiction's clear.

07:13.092 --> 07:14.852
Mike's right. Let's move on.

07:31.012 --> 07:32.833
- 'Hi.'
- Hey, sorry about earlier.

07:32.858 --> 07:34.771
Just calling to catch the kids.

07:34.772 --> 07:38.291
'Right. Nothing about school, OK?
Try not to upset Charlie.'

07:38.292 --> 07:39.611
Sure, sure.

07:39.612 --> 07:42.132
'Ella, Charlie! Daddy's on the phone.

07:43.292 --> 07:45.131
'Quick one, mind. It's well late.'

07:45.132 --> 07:46.532
Yeah, sorry, that's my fault.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.492
'Come on, you two.
Say quick night-night to daddy.'

07:53.812 --> 07:55.050
'Night-night.'

07:55.371 --> 07:57.251
Night, sweetheart. Love you.

07:57.276 --> 07:58.356
'Go on, Charlie.'

07:59.332 --> 08:02.251
- 'Night, Daddy.'
- Night, big man. Love you.

08:02.252 --> 08:04.647
'All right, you two. Off to bed now, OK?

08:05.292 --> 08:07.673
'I'm sorry, I want to get them both
down for the night.'

08:08.532 --> 08:11.210
I could come over tomorrow and
we could go and see the head.

08:12.012 --> 08:14.331
'What's the point, Dave?
We've tried that.

08:14.332 --> 08:16.194
'Unless you've got a magic wand?'

08:18.012 --> 08:20.143
I'm sorry.

08:20.572 --> 08:21.692
Night-night.

08:28.652 --> 08:31.571
'Officers from the Metropolitan
Police Counter-Terrorism Command,

08:31.572 --> 08:33.650
'SO15, have been working round the clock

08:33.676 --> 08:35.399
pursuing links to the 1st
of October rail attackers.'

08:35.400 --> 08:36.933
'The 1/10 device was
extremely sophisticated

08:36.957 --> 08:38.331
and the Metropolitan Police

08:38.332 --> 08:40.770
'have expressed fears other devices
may have been constructed.'

08:40.772 --> 08:42.332
'..whilst the UK threat level,

08:42.357 --> 08:44.533
set by the Joint Terrorism
Analysis Centre...'

08:44.534 --> 08:47.931
'So far, no further arrests have
been made and accomplices to

08:47.932 --> 08:50.812
'the 1st of October bombers
may still be at large.'

08:59.652 --> 09:00.892
Ma'am.

09:13.172 --> 09:14.612
- This way, ma'am.
- Thanks.

09:18.332 --> 09:20.051
Ma'am, thanks for coming down.

09:20.052 --> 09:23.571
- What's going on?
- Multiple subject activity on WhatsApp.

09:23.572 --> 09:25.531
The metadata fits with a cell
on our watchlist.

09:25.532 --> 09:26.965
Everything else is end-to-end encrypted.

09:26.990 --> 09:28.411
- Location?
- South London.

09:28.412 --> 09:29.531
We've got lumps on their cars.

09:29.532 --> 09:32.054
I'm assuming we'll share this
with the Security Service.

09:32.079 --> 09:33.411
May be worth getting their
take on it, you know.

09:33.412 --> 09:35.611
No. Not just yet.

09:35.612 --> 09:37.571
- We got MASTS in situ?
- Yes, ma'am.

09:37.572 --> 09:38.797
They've reported to the TFC.

09:38.822 --> 09:41.556
- Subjects on the move. One team visual.
-  Right.

09:46.092 --> 09:49.167
They're taking no chances.
Driving like my gran!

09:50.212 --> 09:53.651
Alpha 2-3. Brixton
Road, northbound speed 2-5.

09:53.652 --> 09:55.611
Continuing north.

09:55.612 --> 09:58.652
En route towards high-value targets
in the Lambeth/Waterloo areas.

10:00.012 --> 10:04.453
OK, let's mobilise SCO19
to holding locations

10:04.454 --> 10:07.371
for Waterloo Station/Southbank targets.

10:07.372 --> 10:08.492
- Copy that.
- Sir.

10:09.532 --> 10:10.811
Order from SFC,

10:10.812 --> 10:13.331
Trojan to SE1 hold locations.

10:13.332 --> 10:15.292
Stewart's Road, northbound.

10:20.012 --> 10:22.416
West on Ascalon Street.

10:37.778 --> 10:39.218
Back up.

10:47.092 --> 10:48.212
That's good.

10:54.692 --> 10:57.651
Received. MAST unit stationary,
standing by for further activity

10:57.652 --> 10:59.852
from subject vehicle
inside an industrial unit.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.852
What you doing?

11:24.252 --> 11:26.867
It's them. Shit. Go. Stand by.

11:27.532 --> 11:31.611
Subjects are now driving a white
LGV. Repeat, subjects are now

11:31.612 --> 11:33.171
driving a white LGV.

11:33.172 --> 11:35.524
Subjects are now en route in an LGV.

11:36.092 --> 11:38.091
DAF 7.5-tonner,

11:38.092 --> 11:42.971
Foxtrot, Echo, zero, eight,
Uniform, Yankee, Oscar.

11:42.972 --> 11:45.251
Now they're in an untracked
vehicle, possible VBIED.

11:45.252 --> 11:46.531
We can't lose them.

11:46.532 --> 11:49.490
Alert all ARVs in the area to assist.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.851
If MASTS can't achieve a natural stop,

11:51.852 --> 11:54.451
I'm authorising enforced stop.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.306
Order from SFC, all ARVs

11:56.307 --> 11:58.955
in the vicinity of Alpha two three,
north of Brixton.

12:00.732 --> 12:02.212
Hold back, hold back.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.731
Subject vehicle's diverted
towards Camberwell.

12:14.732 --> 12:15.891
Camberwell? Shit!

12:15.892 --> 12:17.451
Nearest ARVs are en route, ma'am,

12:17.452 --> 12:19.166
but the MAST vehicle's still closest.

12:19.167 --> 12:21.012
TFC's re-spinning the wheel.

12:29.812 --> 12:31.171
Christ, they're onto us.

12:31.172 --> 12:32.732
Carlisle Street. Speed 35.

12:35.612 --> 12:39.371
Authorise MASTS and ARVs to carry
out enforced stop with

12:39.372 --> 12:41.811
critical shot authorised, if required.

12:41.812 --> 12:44.451
SFC to TFC, MASTS and ARVs
authorised for enforced stop,

12:44.452 --> 12:45.731
then critical shot.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.131
Received.

12:47.132 --> 12:49.252
Go, go, go, go!

12:54.092 --> 12:55.572
Go, go, go, go, go!

13:06.572 --> 13:08.012
Shit.

13:13.652 --> 13:16.451
Move it! Move it! Move it, quickly!

13:21.052 --> 13:22.412
Now. You go in.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.731
Now. Now. Quick as you can.

13:27.732 --> 13:29.252
Quick as you can.

13:37.292 --> 13:39.172
Hurry up, hurry up. Come on.

13:50.852 --> 13:53.051
It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

13:53.052 --> 13:56.811
Uniform, Oscar, zero, six.
Shots fired, shots fired.

13:56.812 --> 13:59.091
Subject vehicle stopped. Vehicle stopped.

13:59.092 --> 14:01.933
OFC confirms from MASTS and ARV

14:01.934 --> 14:03.971
subject vehicle under control.

14:03.972 --> 14:05.252
Shots fired.

14:06.143 --> 14:07.851
Armed Police.

14:07.852 --> 14:08.931
Everyone OK?

14:08.932 --> 14:10.572
We're OK, we're OK.

14:12.212 --> 14:14.371
I don't see an IED trigger.

14:14.372 --> 14:17.004
Anyone see an IED trigger?

14:17.372 --> 14:18.492
Stay there!

14:40.292 --> 14:42.771
Two subjects and three officers
confirmed dead at the scene.

14:42.772 --> 14:44.292
Five officers injured, two severely.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.811
- That's right, isn't it, Amit?
- Yes.

14:45.812 --> 14:46.931
My God.

14:46.932 --> 14:48.640
Beyond that,
the full facts are still emerging.

14:48.641 --> 14:51.011
No organisation's claimed responsibility.

14:51.012 --> 14:53.691
7-9, go back-to-back on two.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.571
7-9 on two.

14:55.572 --> 14:58.211
Skipper, it's just come up on the Box,

14:58.212 --> 15:01.788
an IED took out a MASTS team
and an ARV in Camberwell.

15:03.172 --> 15:04.251
Jesus.

15:04.252 --> 15:06.971
Three officers down,
more in intensive care.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.691
No idea of the target yet?

15:08.692 --> 15:11.251
No, the incident occurred
near a school in

15:11.252 --> 15:15.340
South London, Heath Bank Primary School.

15:15.892 --> 15:17.159
Shit.

15:17.452 --> 15:18.719
You know the school?

15:19.406 --> 15:20.701
No.

15:21.252 --> 15:25.052
Fortunately, no casualties
amongst the pupils or staff.

15:27.772 --> 15:30.811
I need to get moving, the PM's
chairing COBRA in half-an-hour

15:30.812 --> 15:33.451
and JTAC have already moved
the Threat Level to Severe.

15:33.452 --> 15:35.929
OK. Well, I'll pull everything
together from the Security Services

15:35.930 --> 15:37.772
and SO15 as it comes in.

15:40.892 --> 15:42.411
7-9 Lavender on the move.

15:42.412 --> 15:43.972
Received, 7-9.

15:47.052 --> 15:48.371
Have you heard yet?

15:48.372 --> 15:49.771
Over the radio, ma'am.

15:49.772 --> 15:52.006
Deepest sympathies to
those officers' families.

15:53.902 --> 15:56.091
Strictest confidence, but you've
got a right to know,

15:56.092 --> 15:57.870
it happened near your children's school.

15:58.412 --> 15:59.611
What?

15:59.612 --> 16:00.851
None of the pupils were hurt,

16:00.852 --> 16:02.790
but you should call your wife and kids.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.451
Thank you very much, ma'am.

16:10.812 --> 16:12.251
David...

16:12.252 --> 16:15.171
...till we know more, we've moved
your family to a safe house.

16:15.172 --> 16:17.411
I'm afraid the budget doesn't
stretch to two.

16:17.412 --> 16:20.212
Thank you, ma'am,
I'm glad we're all under one roof.

16:20.655 --> 16:21.945
I've already spoke to them,

16:21.970 --> 16:23.091
- everyone's fine.
- Good.

16:23.092 --> 16:25.131
But you understand the
question it raises?

16:25.132 --> 16:28.098
I don't get how they could know
which officer was responsible

16:28.099 --> 16:31.645
for the 1st of October unless
there's been some kind of leak.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.025
We don't know. We're investigating.

16:35.132 --> 16:38.731
Meanwhile, we have to take the view
if there's any risk,

16:38.732 --> 16:41.211
any risk at all of you being a target,

16:41.212 --> 16:44.626
it puts not only you and your family
in jeopardy but also your

16:44.627 --> 16:47.492
colleagues, maybe even the
principal and her staff.

16:47.976 --> 16:49.129
I'm sorry, David,

16:49.130 --> 16:52.279
but you're restricted to desk duty,
pending reassignment.

16:53.412 --> 16:55.498
Oh, come on, ma'am, I'm not the one
who's fucked up here.

16:55.499 --> 16:57.472
The leak, they're the ones
that should get punished.

16:57.473 --> 16:59.692
This isn't a punishment, David.

17:03.972 --> 17:05.172
Ma'am.

17:37.252 --> 17:39.011
No worries. In you come, Sarge.

17:39.012 --> 17:40.531
Thanks for coming over.

17:40.532 --> 17:42.411
I'm just glad you're all all right.

17:42.412 --> 17:44.012
The whole thing's terrifying.

17:48.612 --> 17:49.647
Kids, your dad's here.

17:49.672 --> 17:51.887
- Daddy!
- Hey, you two. Hey.

17:52.687 --> 17:53.787
You all right?

17:53.812 --> 17:54.891
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:54.892 --> 17:56.452
- There was a big bang.
- Yeah.

17:56.979 --> 17:58.411
My ears hurt.

17:58.412 --> 18:00.011
- Are you all right now?
- Mm-hm.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.849
Mum and Dad are just going to
have a chat next door, OK?

18:03.074 --> 18:04.263
OK.

18:17.372 --> 18:18.797
They've evacuated the school.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.292
Everyone is terrified.

18:22.452 --> 18:24.617
One of the coppers said it could be

18:24.642 --> 18:26.451
that this is all about the train attack.

18:26.452 --> 18:28.731
Problem is, there's too many
out there with a big mouth.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.291
You've lost some colleagues today,
I get that.

18:31.292 --> 18:33.082
Dave, it could have
been your own children.

18:33.107 --> 18:34.291
I know.

18:34.292 --> 18:36.651
If you're going to be like this,
maybe you should just go.

18:36.652 --> 18:38.531
Not if the three of you
are in danger. No.

18:38.532 --> 18:39.876
What, do you think they'll try again?

18:39.901 --> 18:41.036
Well, I don't know, do I?

19:36.292 --> 19:38.571
- How's it going, Skipper?
- Aye, brilliant.

19:38.572 --> 19:41.051
It's great fun organising duty rotas.

19:41.052 --> 19:43.531
- Maybe I could make you a cuppa?
- Kim, shake a leg.

19:43.532 --> 19:45.051
Oh, sorry, Skip.

19:45.052 --> 19:46.532
I'll catch you later.

19:54.092 --> 19:55.392
Sorry, Sarge.

20:12.932 --> 20:14.291
Do you know any of them?

20:14.292 --> 20:16.691
- ..the number of dead to five.
- Not really.

20:16.692 --> 20:17.731
Poor bastards.

20:17.732 --> 20:20.091
The Home Secretary
Julia Montague had this...

20:20.092 --> 20:22.651
Had enough of them over the years.
Too many.

20:22.652 --> 20:25.851
The Government will do all in
our power to bring the perpetrator...

20:25.852 --> 20:27.371
Sanctimonious bitch.

20:27.372 --> 20:30.524
And I call upon my parliamentary
colleagues to pass my

20:30.525 --> 20:33.771
strengthened Regulation
of Investigatory Powers Bill...

20:33.772 --> 20:35.331
She's doing exactly what they all do,

20:35.332 --> 20:37.691
exploit the situation
to get more power for themselves.

20:37.692 --> 20:40.331
She said shit like that during the war.

20:40.332 --> 20:42.891
Just a snivelling little MP back then,

20:42.892 --> 20:45.110
trying to join in the big boys' game.

20:45.732 --> 20:48.432
Sign a piece of paper,
100 blokes get killed.

20:49.212 --> 20:51.531
But who suffers?
Her kind couldn't give a shit.

20:51.532 --> 20:54.691
I can't believe you protect them.

20:54.692 --> 20:55.710
Did.

20:56.372 --> 20:57.692
What's that, mate?

20:59.492 --> 21:01.052
I'm a "security risk".

21:03.492 --> 21:06.021
They've put Vic and the kids
in a safe house.

21:07.772 --> 21:09.050
Shit.

21:09.412 --> 21:10.974
See, I can live with being in
the line of fire,

21:10.975 --> 21:12.281
I've made a career out of it,

21:12.282 --> 21:15.278
but my family... they were always...

21:16.532 --> 21:17.990
...home, safe.

21:18.532 --> 21:20.211
That's the way it works.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.411
Even in civvy street,
it's the same thing.

21:22.412 --> 21:23.851
They're in it for themselves,

21:23.852 --> 21:27.211
they couldn't give a shit about a
bloke like you that takes the risks.

21:27.212 --> 21:30.372
You're the mug that suffers
the consequences.

21:33.412 --> 21:35.692
How do you reckon she'd feel,

21:36.338 --> 21:38.218
if she got a taste?

21:39.052 --> 21:40.172
Taste of what?

21:41.652 --> 21:43.292
Suffering the consequences.

21:48.692 --> 21:51.491
We were able to recover
remnants of the device.

21:51.492 --> 21:55.051
It was operated by a timer, which
we assume the bombers activated

21:55.052 --> 21:58.091
when they made their final charge
towards the school.

21:58.092 --> 22:01.851
The explosive employed was
Triacetone triperoxide,

22:01.852 --> 22:04.979
the composition of which proved
a match to the one employed on

22:04.980 --> 22:06.325
the 1st of October.

22:06.326 --> 22:10.251
Both devices were extremely powerful,
with sophisticated mechanisms.

22:10.252 --> 22:11.589
And the reason for targeting the school,

22:11.614 --> 22:13.211
has that become any clearer yet?

22:13.212 --> 22:16.891
It's possible someone who witnessed
the 1st of October rail attack,

22:16.892 --> 22:20.641
a civilian member of staff, maybe,
a member of the public,

22:20.642 --> 22:24.372
we don't know,
has links to the terrorists.

22:25.732 --> 22:26.754
Right.

22:26.755 --> 22:29.211
Much more likely, the leak was internal.

22:29.212 --> 22:30.811
There's no evidence for that.

22:30.812 --> 22:34.188
Either you've got a security breach
in your own ranks or your

22:34.189 --> 22:38.691
officers failed to detect another
accomplice involved in 1/10.

22:38.692 --> 22:42.131
Added to which, your surveillance
operation failed to detect

22:42.132 --> 22:44.620
the subjects had hired
a light goods vehicle.

22:44.621 --> 22:46.370
If there are any learnings to be
made from this incident...

22:46.371 --> 22:48.411
Oh, please don't say "learnings".

22:48.412 --> 22:50.851
Now, since you haven't
announced any new leads,

22:50.852 --> 22:52.651
I'm assuming you haven't got any?

22:52.652 --> 22:54.715
We're still putting together
a picture of events

22:54.716 --> 22:56.168
surrounding the attack.

22:56.169 --> 22:58.845
And, if you succeed,
will you share that information?

22:59.692 --> 23:01.651
Yes, of course, Home Secretary. Why...?

23:01.652 --> 23:04.211
When it became clear the subjects
were gathering to carry out

23:04.212 --> 23:05.975
an operation, did the police share

23:06.000 --> 23:07.258
that information with
the Security Service?

23:07.259 --> 23:09.741
With respect, I don't see how that
would have altered the outcome...

23:09.742 --> 23:12.514
I'm starting to lose confidence
in the police's ability to make

23:12.515 --> 23:15.471
rapid enough progress, so I'd like
to take up Stephen's proposal

23:15.472 --> 23:17.590
for the Security Service to assume

23:17.591 --> 23:19.226
a role in interviewing the 1/10 bombers.

23:19.251 --> 23:20.771
- What?
- Thank you.

23:20.772 --> 23:23.626
Home Secretary, you are setting
a dangerous precedent.

23:23.627 --> 23:27.900
We agreed, I think,
this can only be a police matter.

23:27.901 --> 23:31.211
We all welcome intelligence guidance
from the Security Service.

23:31.212 --> 23:33.091
Exactly. Thank you.

23:33.092 --> 23:35.316
My officers and I are determined
to succeed in neutralising...

23:35.317 --> 23:38.484
No, the one officer who actually
successfully averted a threat,

23:38.485 --> 23:42.172
he's the one you people want to
remove from my protection team?

23:42.544 --> 23:44.293
It sends completely the wrong message.

23:49.292 --> 23:52.091
Um... that isn't my department.

23:52.092 --> 23:55.051
No, your department is counter-terrorism,

23:55.052 --> 23:57.931
the most expensive area of policing,

23:57.932 --> 23:59.251
and it's failing.

23:59.252 --> 24:01.526
Home Secretary, I don't understand
why you're saying this now.

24:01.527 --> 24:03.492
I think we're done here.

24:10.972 --> 24:12.292
Fuck you, Stephen.

24:27.652 --> 24:28.812
It's all right.

24:38.692 --> 24:40.726
That all got a bit heated in there.

24:42.892 --> 24:47.131
I hope I'm not speaking out of turn,
Julia. The security guidance

24:47.132 --> 24:49.731
regarding PS Budd's removal is
completely justified.

24:49.732 --> 24:51.452
I'm a target, regardless.

24:52.652 --> 24:54.091
Anne Sampson's right, you know.

24:54.092 --> 24:56.851
I'm hoping you're not serious about
giving more responsibility to

24:56.852 --> 24:59.731
the Security Service. They're less
transparent, less accountable.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.692
It sets a dangerous precedent.

25:02.212 --> 25:04.812
The real danger's to our
national security.

25:12.972 --> 25:14.731
Yes, Mum.

25:14.732 --> 25:17.371
Yes, I know, but they're fine.
I promise you.

25:17.372 --> 25:19.091
Hang on. Give me two seconds.

25:19.092 --> 25:21.331
Kids, I'm not going to ask you again!

25:21.332 --> 25:23.771
Breakfast's ready, come down.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.252
Mum, I'm going to give you
a call back, all right? OK.

25:28.172 --> 25:29.731
Post from your home address.

25:29.732 --> 25:31.251
Don't worry, it all gets X-rayed.

25:31.252 --> 25:32.412
Oh, thanks.

25:50.292 --> 25:52.011
Dave?

25:52.012 --> 25:53.371
Dave?

25:53.372 --> 25:55.171
- Yeah?
- Look!

25:57.012 --> 25:59.011
Charlie, come downstairs.

25:59.012 --> 26:00.251
Look at this.

26:00.252 --> 26:02.011
Charlie, it's good news. Come down.

26:02.012 --> 26:04.561
They've said he can start after
half-term. Isn't that brilliant?

26:04.562 --> 26:05.854
Someone's pulled strings.

26:05.855 --> 26:07.840
Oh, how would they know about Charlie?

26:08.532 --> 26:11.051
- I'm not sure.
- It doesn't matter. It's brilliant.

26:11.052 --> 26:13.811
Charlie. So, you know that nice
school that's going to help

26:13.812 --> 26:16.771
you with your reading, yeah?
Well, they've said you can go there.

26:16.772 --> 26:19.171
- Really?
- Isn't that great? Yeah?

26:19.172 --> 26:20.165
Aw.

26:20.772 --> 26:22.134
Come on. Shall we tell your sister?

26:22.159 --> 26:23.171
- Yeah?
- Ella.

26:32.372 --> 26:33.412
David.

26:40.452 --> 26:43.807
Your line manager doesn't
appreciate your attitude to

26:43.808 --> 26:45.852
administrative duties.

26:47.092 --> 26:48.972
They are not my strong suit.

26:50.172 --> 26:52.291
Just as well you're being
restored to active duty

26:52.292 --> 26:53.626
at the Home Office, then.

26:55.852 --> 26:57.471
Thank you, ma'am.

26:57.972 --> 26:59.392
Not me.

26:59.932 --> 27:02.929
Seems like you've made friends
in high places.

27:08.132 --> 27:09.472
That's it. Piss off.

27:10.892 --> 27:12.052
Ma'am.

27:38.612 --> 27:39.772
Yes, it's terrible.

27:41.532 --> 27:44.811
Hi. Look, Julia's expecting you.
I'll take you right through.

27:44.812 --> 27:46.052
Cheers, Mike.

27:52.292 --> 27:54.144
Simpler if it's just Stephen and I.

27:54.145 --> 27:56.070
You don't mind, do you, Mike?

27:56.071 --> 27:58.506
Uh, no. OK. carry on.

27:59.212 --> 28:01.171
Home Secretary, how are you today?

28:01.172 --> 28:03.771
Better than the bastards trying to
blow us to kingdom come.

28:03.772 --> 28:06.731
I've put a first-rate team on
the 1/10 bombers.

28:06.732 --> 28:08.331
We're confident we'll identify...

28:10.812 --> 28:12.212
Take a seat, Stephen.

28:13.332 --> 28:15.142
I knew I could count on you.

28:15.772 --> 28:18.292
Just holding up my end of the bargain.

28:20.492 --> 28:23.851
There isn't a listening device
in this office, is there?

28:23.852 --> 28:24.892
You tell me.

28:28.465 --> 28:31.785
Given the sensitivity of the material,

28:31.810 --> 28:35.969
we've got to be meticulous in our
corroboration of the facts.

28:49.972 --> 28:51.732
It's good to have you back, PS Budd.

28:53.492 --> 28:54.692
Thank you, ma'am.

28:57.452 --> 28:58.491
Cheers, Kim.

28:58.492 --> 29:00.092
See you over there, Skip.

29:02.932 --> 29:05.492
Sierra Zulu 7-9, Lavender on the move.

29:20.972 --> 29:23.011
I hope this is OK.

29:23.012 --> 29:24.171
Good choice.

29:24.172 --> 29:25.972
Haven't been here in ages.

29:29.732 --> 29:32.732
You've just been under
so much stress lately.

29:33.852 --> 29:37.700
Don't worry, we'll order some wine as
soon as Indira and Sanjeev arrive.

29:38.612 --> 29:40.460
It's not like them to be late.

29:40.932 --> 29:41.956
You couldn't text them,

29:41.957 --> 29:43.834
make sure they haven't gone to
the wrong place?

29:44.612 --> 29:45.932
I was, uh...

29:47.672 --> 29:49.472
...worried you'd cancel.

29:56.612 --> 29:58.012
They're not coming?

29:59.172 --> 30:00.212
Sorry.

30:02.772 --> 30:03.812
It's OK.

30:08.092 --> 30:10.292
- Would you care to see the menu?
- No, thank you.

30:23.932 --> 30:26.571
Probably best if we all reschedule.

30:26.572 --> 30:28.418
I'm sorry, I should have told you,

30:28.419 --> 30:31.751
but let's have some nice food,
a couple of drinks, on me.

30:32.252 --> 30:33.492
This feels weird.

30:40.332 --> 30:42.686
Change of plan, Lavender on the move.

30:43.452 --> 30:45.211
Have you home in no time, ma'am.

30:45.212 --> 30:46.313
Great.

30:49.212 --> 30:51.411
I've just remembered I've got nothing in.

30:51.412 --> 30:53.392
Do you mind if we stop
on the way home, David?

30:54.052 --> 30:55.572
Certainly.

30:57.052 --> 30:58.892
This is very generous of you, ma'am.

31:01.058 --> 31:04.430
I'm just pleased you didn't veto
the idea for security reasons.

31:05.052 --> 31:08.131
You're pleased my night out
was an unmitigated disaster?

31:08.132 --> 31:09.192
No.

31:10.732 --> 31:13.491
It's just, there's risk with
being seen out in public.

31:13.492 --> 31:16.039
Well, it's easy to say when
you're a smug married.

31:18.679 --> 31:20.519
Sorry, have I put my foot in it?

31:20.544 --> 31:21.710
I'm separated.

31:21.735 --> 31:23.009
Oh.

31:24.158 --> 31:26.158
I hope I didn't cause offence.

31:26.372 --> 31:28.371
I must have misunderstood.

31:28.372 --> 31:30.491
The phone call with my wife?

31:30.492 --> 31:31.554
Mm.

31:31.932 --> 31:34.811
I've made the mistake of
judging by my own standards.

31:35.412 --> 31:38.251
By the end of my marriage, we were
incapable of speaking to each

31:38.252 --> 31:40.190
other with anything other
than utter contempt.

31:40.191 --> 31:42.331
Don't worry, we have our moments.

31:42.332 --> 31:44.452
I just try to put the kids first.

31:46.018 --> 31:47.658
And how are they faring?

31:51.212 --> 31:53.218
We had some good news about
my son's schooling.

31:53.219 --> 31:54.311
Mm.

31:54.752 --> 31:56.132
I'm glad.

31:59.652 --> 32:02.721
If you were involved, ma'am,
my family's very grateful.

32:03.812 --> 32:06.092
I went into politics to help people.

32:14.572 --> 32:15.706
Well...

32:16.092 --> 32:17.961
...you don't want to keep
the backup vehicle waiting

32:17.962 --> 32:19.114
and I've got work to do, so...

32:19.115 --> 32:22.212
Yes, of course,
I'll just clean this up, ma'am.

32:24.572 --> 32:26.292
Unless you fancy a cuppa.

32:29.692 --> 32:31.092
I should make it.

32:31.772 --> 32:34.788
Kettles, ma'am, they can be quite
the danger in untrained hands.

33:10.092 --> 33:12.131
Planning to move in, Home Secretary?

33:12.132 --> 33:14.026
Lavender and Indigo inbound.

33:14.263 --> 33:17.291
Are we facing a state of emergency,
Home Secretary?

33:17.292 --> 33:19.772
Is this your new address, Home Secretary?

33:20.932 --> 33:22.812
Are you moving in?

33:38.052 --> 33:40.092
- Want a heads-up?
- Nope.

33:43.572 --> 33:44.691
PM's pissed off.

33:44.692 --> 33:46.531
Thinks you're hogging the limelight.

33:46.532 --> 33:49.232
Naturally, I've disabused him of
the idea that you're rogue enough

33:49.233 --> 33:50.966
to attempt a leadership challenge.

33:51.652 --> 33:53.891
Everyone's ready, Prime Minister.

33:53.892 --> 33:55.326
Thanks, Roger.

33:56.372 --> 33:57.883
- Morning, everyone.
- Morning.

33:57.908 --> 33:59.091
Morning, Prime Minister.

33:59.092 --> 34:00.536
Did anyone see the Arsenal
game last night?

34:18.851 --> 34:21.291
I hope the family's coping with the move.

34:21.292 --> 34:23.172
It must be very disruptive.

34:24.772 --> 34:26.063
They're all a bit anxious.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.790
I can't deny it, ma'am.

34:27.791 --> 34:29.252
Sorry to hear that.

34:32.092 --> 34:34.371
I hope you don't mind me asking, ma'am...

34:34.371 --> 34:35.411
Yes?

34:37.052 --> 34:39.608
...how did you know the name of
my kids' school?

34:42.132 --> 34:45.125
It must have appeared in the
immediate incident report.

34:49.692 --> 34:51.658
Sorry, ma'am, I don't mean to argue.

34:52.012 --> 34:54.411
The attack occurred only
a few minutes before.

34:54.411 --> 34:56.971
It seems a bit early for
the connection to be made.

34:56.972 --> 34:59.089
It must have been in relation
to your son,

34:59.090 --> 35:01.489
from asking a colleague
in the Department for Education

35:01.490 --> 35:03.832
to organise his transfer
to a specialist school.

35:14.292 --> 35:15.731
David, let's talk...

35:17.252 --> 35:18.931
Down, down!

35:18.932 --> 35:20.491
Go, go!

35:47.452 --> 35:48.443
Ma'am! Stay down.

35:48.444 --> 35:49.643
The bullets can pierce the windows

35:49.668 --> 35:52.131
but they can't get through
the armoured metal.

35:52.132 --> 35:55.731
Control, Sierra Zulu 7-9, Status
Zero, Thornton Circus. Control,

35:55.732 --> 35:59.771
Sierra Zulu 7-9, Status Zero,
Thornton Circus. Lavender is TA.

35:59.772 --> 36:01.131
Repeat, Lavender is TA.

36:01.132 --> 36:04.611
Sierra Zulu 7-9, Control, received.

36:04.612 --> 36:07.989
All call signs proceed to
Thornton Circus urgently,

36:09.364 --> 36:11.571
4-7, 7-9, back-to-back on two.

36:11.572 --> 36:13.197
Received, 7-9.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.965
We've lost Terry. We're sitting
tight, waiting for backup.

36:15.990 --> 36:17.291
Suggest you do the same.

36:17.292 --> 36:18.491
Wilco.

36:21.372 --> 36:22.611
It's OK, ma'am. It's OK.

36:22.612 --> 36:24.831
The bullets can't get through
the armour plating.

36:25.452 --> 36:27.334
It's OK. It's OK.

36:29.612 --> 36:32.051
Control, 7-9 Sierra Zulu with a sit rep.

36:32.052 --> 36:33.371
Go ahead, 7-9.

36:33.372 --> 36:34.731
We need armed support and air ops

36:34.732 --> 36:36.411
to the scene as operational priority.

36:36.412 --> 36:37.731
TFC's deploying to the scene.

36:37.732 --> 36:39.931
Area being cordoned off and
unarmed held back.

36:39.932 --> 36:42.171
ARVs en route, ETA two minutes.

36:42.172 --> 36:45.091
Control, 7-9, received.
Two minutes, ma'am.

36:45.092 --> 36:47.008
We sit tight. You're going to be fine.

36:47.812 --> 36:49.531
You're doing really well, ma'am.

36:49.532 --> 36:50.820
You're doing great.

36:52.852 --> 36:54.411
It's OK.

36:54.412 --> 36:55.811
It's OK, ma'am.

36:55.812 --> 36:57.731
It's OK. It's OK.

36:57.732 --> 37:00.477
It's OK. It's OK.

37:01.252 --> 37:03.412
It's all right. It's OK.

37:08.532 --> 37:10.852
Stay right down, ma'am.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.589
Control, sit rep, Sierra Zulu 7-9.

37:35.590 --> 37:36.782
Go ahead, 7-9.

37:36.783 --> 37:38.702
Shooter is located on roof of
Pascoe House,

37:38.703 --> 37:41.331
1,000 feet south of Thornton Circus.

37:41.332 --> 37:43.531
- Single shooter only.
- Received, 7-9.

37:43.532 --> 37:45.091
Where are those ARVs?

37:45.092 --> 37:46.331
Area lockdown ongoing.

37:46.332 --> 37:48.011
ETA two minutes.

37:48.012 --> 37:49.612
You already said two minutes!

37:53.020 --> 37:54.699
Ma'am, I need to get you to safety.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.849
Ma'am, this is what I do. Trust me.

38:14.744 --> 38:17.491
4-7, 7-9, back-to-back on two.

38:17.492 --> 38:18.771
Go ahead, 7-9.

38:18.772 --> 38:20.713
We're sitting ducks here.
Lavender on the move.

38:20.714 --> 38:23.091
- Shit, what?
- Follow, close formation.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.692
Here we go, ma'am.

38:27.692 --> 38:30.011
Stay right down, ma'am.

38:30.012 --> 38:32.252
The roof armour will protect us, ma'am.

38:36.812 --> 38:38.611
You're doing great, ma'am.

38:38.612 --> 38:40.246
Soon, he won't have a line of sight.

38:46.532 --> 38:49.212
We're safe now, ma'am. Hold tight.

38:55.052 --> 38:56.332
Don't move, ma'am.

38:58.092 --> 38:59.132
You'll be fine.

39:00.252 --> 39:01.931
No! Don't...

39:01.932 --> 39:04.452
- Take care of the P.
- Sarge.

39:06.932 --> 39:08.964
Armed police! Get down!

39:08.965 --> 39:10.907
Stay down! Remain calm.

39:10.908 --> 39:12.731
I need access to the roof.

39:12.732 --> 39:15.451
Stay down! Remain calm.

39:15.452 --> 39:17.383
Officers will be arriving.

39:18.652 --> 39:19.692
This way.

39:32.652 --> 39:34.052
I need the roof.

39:39.212 --> 39:41.932
Though there, and up.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.372
It's over, mate.

40:50.892 --> 40:52.046
It's over.

40:53.972 --> 40:55.052
For me.

40:56.412 --> 40:57.572
Not for you.

40:59.212 --> 41:01.132
You've got to finish the job.

41:03.491 --> 41:04.891
I'm fucked.

41:11.492 --> 41:12.981
Don't.

41:13.372 --> 41:16.091
Someone's got to stop her. Get it done.

41:16.092 --> 41:17.491
Don't!

41:48.052 --> 41:49.691
Area confirmed secure.

41:49.692 --> 41:50.851
Lavender safe to travel.

41:50.852 --> 41:53.450
Escorting her out of the building now.

41:57.452 --> 41:59.732
I'm very sorry about Terry, ma'am.

42:06.052 --> 42:09.171
The attack on the Home
Secretary began with shots fired

42:09.172 --> 42:10.531
from the roof of Pascoe House,

42:10.532 --> 42:11.804
an office building undergoing
refurbishment.

42:11.805 --> 42:13.564
Numerous rounds struck the
Home Secretary's vehicle,

42:13.565 --> 42:16.860
claiming the life of her driver,
who's been named as Terence Foyer.

42:16.861 --> 42:19.480
The Home Secretary,
Julia Montague, was unhurt

42:19.481 --> 42:21.526
in the attack and is
currently in a secure location

42:21.527 --> 42:23.226
receiving round-the-clock
police protection.

42:23.227 --> 42:24.716
As a result of the assassination
attempt against Home Secretary

42:24.717 --> 42:27.946
Julia Montague, the UK Threat Level
has been raised to Critical.

42:27.947 --> 42:30.292
The Metropolitan Police Commissioner
says the recent terror events

42:30.293 --> 42:33.916
pose an unprecedented threat
to national security.

43:20.572 --> 43:22.332
PS Budd.

43:35.438 --> 43:37.758
Service entrance just round to
the right, Sarge.

43:55.812 --> 43:59.252
No complaints about the
surroundings, but...

44:00.692 --> 44:04.007
...it's unsettling not to be allowed
back into your own home.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.766
Following an attempt on your life, ma'am,

44:06.767 --> 44:09.075
all protection measures
have been ramped up.

44:12.852 --> 44:15.052
And do you think I'm still in danger?

44:16.352 --> 44:19.437
It'll turn out to be a nut-job
acting alone.

44:21.932 --> 44:24.371
SO15 don't know anything
about the gunman?

44:24.372 --> 44:26.857
I can't imagine they're telling me
more than they're telling you, ma'am.

44:28.490 --> 44:31.449
I've got a meeting in the morning
with Stephen Hunter-Dunn.

44:32.009 --> 44:34.575
Maybe the Security Service can
shed more light.

44:47.379 --> 44:50.276
Why were the police held back
from entering the square?

44:51.172 --> 44:53.691
It wasn't safe for unarmed
officers to go in.

44:53.692 --> 44:56.037
No, I don't mean them, the ARVs.

44:56.732 --> 44:59.811
We were under attack, you, me,
members of the public.

44:59.812 --> 45:01.691
- Terry was blown apart.
- Ma'am, are all right?

45:01.692 --> 45:03.451
Who would give that order?

45:03.452 --> 45:06.890
To hold resources back and
leave us in the line of fire?

45:06.891 --> 45:08.650
I can't imagine that's what was going on.

45:08.651 --> 45:10.809
Just answer the question, please, David.

45:12.939 --> 45:17.032
That would be
an executive officer at SO15.

45:21.372 --> 45:22.574
Anne Sampson.

45:29.092 --> 45:30.408
I can't imagine for a moment

45:30.433 --> 45:32.536
the ARVs were being held
back without good reason.

45:32.537 --> 45:34.449
First priority's preservation of life.

45:34.450 --> 45:36.213
I was being shot at!

45:40.532 --> 45:43.891
That would suit her, wouldn't it,
me being smashed to pieces?

45:43.892 --> 45:47.179
Ma'am, why don't you sit down
and let me take care of this?

46:11.892 --> 46:13.372
I'm not the Queen.

46:15.092 --> 46:16.972
You're allowed to touch me.

49:58.609 --> 50:01.691
Home Secretary, is there a concern
you're still a target?

50:01.692 --> 50:04.833
For security reasons, I'm afraid
I can't disclose any specifics.

50:05.292 --> 50:07.891
Any comment on the assassination attempt?

50:07.892 --> 50:12.211
Only that I'm extremely grateful
for the swift and courageous

50:12.212 --> 50:14.531
actions of the Security Services,

50:14.532 --> 50:18.545
and I'm deeply thankful there
weren't more casualties.

50:19.612 --> 50:22.131
How are you feeling, Home Secretary?

50:22.132 --> 50:25.029
I'm feeling ready to return
to my mission of fighting the

50:25.030 --> 50:29.766
enemies of democracy and I'm
undaunted in my determination

50:29.767 --> 50:34.558
to pass the RIPA-18 legislation
needed to get that job done.

50:36.332 --> 50:39.798
Not stage-managed... at all.

50:41.852 --> 50:43.614
Who's she trying to kid?

50:44.772 --> 50:46.758
Oh, yeah, Number Ten.

51:05.332 --> 51:07.211
Yeah, Mike Travis.

51:07.212 --> 51:09.600
Could you put me through to
Anne Sampson's office at

51:09.601 --> 51:10.819
New Scotland Yard?

51:11.572 --> 51:12.972
Thanks.

51:18.332 --> 51:19.813
David, come in.

51:20.452 --> 51:22.252
Sorry to keep you waiting.

51:23.678 --> 51:27.558
As you can imagine,
it's pretty hectic round here.

51:27.583 --> 51:29.343
Any progress, ma'am?

51:29.368 --> 51:30.888
Not yet.

51:30.932 --> 51:35.051
The shooter signed into Pascoe House
as a tradesman using a false name.

51:35.052 --> 51:37.651
He was carrying no ID or devices.

51:37.652 --> 51:39.818
Fingerprints haven't thrown up
a database match either.

51:39.819 --> 51:43.051
We'll find out, and his
accomplices if there are any.

51:43.052 --> 51:44.852
I'm not here. Eyes front.

51:46.725 --> 51:49.245
You've distinguished yourself
again, David.

51:49.270 --> 51:51.910
I intend to put you forward
for a commendation.

51:51.935 --> 51:54.095
There's even talk of a medal.

51:54.132 --> 51:55.491
Thank you very much, ma'am.

51:55.492 --> 51:59.162
Obviously, Thornton Circus will have
to be looked into by the IOPC,

51:59.163 --> 52:00.422
as the gunman died at the scene,

52:00.423 --> 52:03.500
but all the witnesses say you acted
with complete professionalism.

52:03.501 --> 52:06.129
There's 101 places I need to be.

52:06.932 --> 52:08.252
Sorry, ma'am.

52:10.872 --> 52:12.245
Stephen Hunter-Dunn,

52:12.270 --> 52:15.070
the director general of
the Security Service.

52:15.332 --> 52:19.456
The Home Secretary's met with him
how many times in recent weeks?

52:20.132 --> 52:21.931
I've not been counting, ma'am.

52:21.932 --> 52:23.758
They're having almost daily conferences

52:23.783 --> 52:25.911
and keeping me out of the loop? Why?

52:26.212 --> 52:27.340
No idea, ma'am.

52:27.341 --> 52:29.371
She's overruled our security advice.

52:29.372 --> 52:32.258
She's taking the 1st of October
attack off us.

52:33.132 --> 52:36.059
Unjustified, unprecedented.

52:36.332 --> 52:39.851
This is a very,
very dangerous politician.

52:39.852 --> 52:42.203
Someone who must be stopped.

52:43.252 --> 52:48.562
But a politician who happens to
regard you as her blue-eyed boy.

52:49.252 --> 52:52.891
There's an upside to the Home
Secretary having you reinstated.

52:52.892 --> 52:56.481
You know everyone she meets,
when, where, how long.

52:58.372 --> 53:02.131
We've arranged to keep her at The
Blackwood, with an adjoining room.

53:02.132 --> 53:05.475
My surveillance team will issue you
with the necessary equipment

53:05.476 --> 53:07.103
to monitor her meetings.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.372
Is that lawful, ma'am?

53:12.758 --> 53:15.762
I've got my duties as a PPO.
I'd rather stick to those, ma'am.

53:17.892 --> 53:20.481
She's got you wrapped round her finger.

53:21.412 --> 53:23.771
I see this all the time, David.

53:23.772 --> 53:26.251
The minister ingratiates
himself with the PPO.

53:26.252 --> 53:29.451
A favour here, pulling strings there.

53:29.452 --> 53:31.896
You think it's out of
the goodness of their heart?

53:32.732 --> 53:35.051
It's so you'll keep their secrets,
no matter what.

53:35.052 --> 53:38.081
Our investigation is well under way
into the bombing that took place

53:38.082 --> 53:40.172
right next to your kids' school.

53:41.772 --> 53:45.251
We heard the Security Service
had advance knowledge schools

53:45.252 --> 53:48.467
were targets. And who do they run to
with their intelligence?

53:49.871 --> 53:52.811
One of her team told me,
in strictest confidence, as soon

53:52.812 --> 53:56.451
as the school was mentioned, she
recognised the name straightaway.

53:56.452 --> 53:59.091
There's only one plausible explanation.

53:59.092 --> 54:02.652
She'd been given prior
intelligence it was a target.

54:04.532 --> 54:08.251
All your precious Home Secretary
had to do was say the word and

54:08.252 --> 54:10.251
your kids would have been out
of harm's way.

54:10.252 --> 54:12.492
But she sat back and let it happen.

54:28.732 --> 54:29.852
Ma'am.

54:37.172 --> 54:38.412
Ma'am.

54:44.551 --> 54:45.804
I'll be in the adjoining room.

54:45.829 --> 54:47.977
- Have a good evening, ma'am.
- Yeah.

54:48.002 --> 54:50.081
You too.

57:06.172 --> 57:08.091
My job, your job.

57:08.092 --> 57:10.372
It just complicates everything.

57:12.112 --> 57:13.552
Nothing complicates my job.

57:15.242 --> 57:16.522
It's to protect you.
