WEBVTT

00:01.722 --> 00:03.757
He's a typical little Englander,
and he doesn't like

00:03.825 --> 00:04.891
going out of his comfort zone.

00:04.960 --> 00:06.326
Bollocks are squashed.

00:06.394 --> 00:10.748
I just think that it'd be amazing
to send him around the world.

00:10.868 --> 00:15.029
What we'd like to see is him
experience other cultures,

00:15.149 --> 00:20.411
other peoples, and see if, in any way, we
can change his outlook on the world.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.214
I've been to many exotic places.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.116
I genuinely think travel
broadens the mind.

00:24.184 --> 00:26.185
I want him to hate it.

00:26.254 --> 00:28.822
I want him to hate every minute
of it for my own amusement.

00:29.964 --> 00:34.678
Nothing is funnier than Karl in a
corner being poked by a stick.

00:34.798 --> 00:35.717
I am that stick.

00:35.837 --> 00:39.101
And now I have the might of Sky behind me.

00:39.221 --> 00:40.421
[Bleep]

00:40.490 --> 00:41.456
[Bleep]

00:41.922 --> 00:45.760
This is one of the funniest, most
expensive practical jokes I've ever done.

00:45.829 --> 00:47.539
And it's gonna be great.

00:48.656 --> 00:51.599
Just let me go home! Jesus.

00:56.757 --> 01:03.849
Karl, we've arranged for you to go
to Egypt to see the great pyramids.

01:03.918 --> 01:07.453
I mean, there is a remarkable
site, truly one of the seven

01:07.522 --> 01:09.055
wonders of the world.

01:09.123 --> 01:10.990
Now, what do you know
about the great pyramids?

01:11.059 --> 01:11.991
Over 4,000 years old.

01:12.060 --> 01:14.327
4,000 years old.

01:14.396 --> 01:16.429
Are they the oldest
thing on the world?

01:18.700 --> 01:21.367
I told you, he needs an absolute.

01:21.436 --> 01:22.302
He needs an absolute.

01:22.370 --> 01:24.337
Yeah, they're the oldest
thing on the world.

01:24.406 --> 01:27.173
I mean, that's pretty amazing,
that I'm gonna see the

01:27.241 --> 01:28.140
oldest thing on the world.

01:28.209 --> 01:30.443
They're not the oldest thing
on the world, are they?

01:30.512 --> 01:32.279
How do you think they built it?

01:32.347 --> 01:33.714
They took their time.

01:33.782 --> 01:35.416
Didn't have any distractions.

01:35.484 --> 01:38.820
Now you see workmen, it's like,
"you got to get it done.

01:38.888 --> 01:40.421
We've got another job on."

01:40.490 --> 01:42.924
Back then, they'd just be going,
"This is what we've got to do.

01:42.993 --> 01:43.525
Get it done.

01:43.594 --> 01:44.326
Get it built.

01:44.395 --> 01:45.360
Go for that shape."

01:45.429 --> 01:48.831
And each day, they would have
just... the foreman went, "Go for

01:48.900 --> 01:51.267
that shape," and they
went, "All right."

01:51.335 --> 01:52.443
Yeah.

01:52.685 --> 01:53.636
Right.

01:53.705 --> 01:55.504
Go on, then.
Enjoy the pyramids.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.328
All right.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.816
I think we've got to
send him economy.

02:07.885 --> 02:10.953
I think we've got to put him up
in shacks and awful hotels, and

02:11.020 --> 02:13.889
that will be funny.

02:19.930 --> 02:23.300
The nice hotel seems
to have gone now.

02:23.369 --> 02:25.136
That's not good, is it?

02:25.204 --> 02:27.838
This is grim 'round here.

02:27.907 --> 02:30.375
And something looks grim in the
dark, you know it's not gonna be

02:30.444 --> 02:36.849
better in the day, don't you?

02:36.918 --> 02:41.087
We had here Michael
Palin, monty python.

02:41.156 --> 02:42.556
And has he been back since?

02:42.625 --> 02:44.491
No.

02:50.332 --> 02:52.700
Thank you.

03:00.075 --> 03:01.443
How long are we here?

03:01.511 --> 03:02.010
Huh?

03:02.079 --> 03:04.913
How long are we here for?

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074

03:14.224 --> 03:20.728
I don't know what... this is... this is
a bit of a... it's a little bit grim.

03:20.797 --> 03:24.832
Look at it.

03:24.901 --> 03:29.237
Did Ricky and Steve know this was...
Well, they knew Michael Palin stayed here.

03:29.305 --> 03:32.673
Yeah, I know, but it
was 30 years ago.

03:32.742 --> 03:34.308
A lot's changed.

03:34.377 --> 03:37.111
You know, I was still at school.

03:37.179 --> 03:41.015
How many days am I here?

03:41.083 --> 03:44.251
There's a piano right
outside the room.

03:44.319 --> 03:45.786
When do they start
playing that piano?

03:45.854 --> 03:47.187
'Cause it's literally right there.

03:47.256 --> 03:50.457
If they start having
a sing-along, I'm...

03:53.528 --> 03:55.295
[Bleep]

03:55.364 --> 03:56.930
Sit on that.

03:56.999 --> 03:57.998
Sit on that.

03:58.066 --> 03:59.366
Is there a mattress on it?

03:59.434 --> 04:00.166
Sit on it.

04:00.235 --> 04:01.868
Honest to God, sit on that.

04:01.937 --> 04:05.839
It is unbelievable.

04:05.907 --> 04:07.707
Oh, God.

04:07.776 --> 04:08.642
How am I gonna sleep?

04:15.583 --> 04:21.321
It's a bit cozy, you know.

04:21.389 --> 04:26.859
Ricky will be all over the moon
with this when he sees this

04:26.928 --> 04:28.728
'cause he wants to annoy me.

04:28.797 --> 04:31.631
I don't know how this is
teaching me anything about sort

04:31.699 --> 04:34.633
of, you know, being egyptian.

04:34.702 --> 04:38.837
I mean, the fella who owns
the place, his dad's 96.

04:38.906 --> 04:41.706
There's no way he lived to be 96
by living on a bed like that in

04:41.775 --> 04:47.778
a dump room like this, having
them out there all night beeping.

04:47.847 --> 04:50.714
I'll leave it there.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.423
I don't know what I'm going to
be doing today, 'cause I haven't

04:59.491 --> 05:00.791
heard from Ricky and Steve yet.

05:00.860 --> 05:05.663
So I'm just gonna go, you
know, go out for a wander...

05:05.732 --> 05:09.459
Walk about, deal with
some locals, you know.

05:09.729 --> 05:11.592
That's the plan, really.

05:18.233 --> 05:20.378
- No, thanks, mate.
- Drink.

05:20.498 --> 05:21.902
- A what?
- Cold drink.

05:21.970 --> 05:27.641
Coca-Cola, sprite, water, tea, cafe,
nescafe, cappuccino, mango, beer.

05:27.710 --> 05:30.343
All drink, 10 pound.

05:30.412 --> 05:32.111
Yeah, I'm all right at the moment.

05:32.180 --> 05:34.106
I might pop in later on.

05:34.226 --> 05:35.392
My name is sharif, okay?

05:35.461 --> 05:36.560
- Sharif.
- Sharif.

05:36.629 --> 05:38.262
- Welcome to Egypt.
- Cheers, Sharif.

05:38.330 --> 05:39.330
I'll be here, okay?

05:39.398 --> 05:41.622
I'll be there for a drink
if I want to get a drink.

05:41.864 --> 05:43.570
- Cheers.
- It's all right.

05:43.684 --> 05:44.764
I've just had a word with sharif.

05:44.884 --> 05:46.919
He's gonna look after me.

05:46.988 --> 05:48.087
Sharif, no cafe.

05:48.155 --> 05:48.921
That's eat?

05:48.989 --> 05:50.968
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.

05:51.088 --> 05:54.093
So, if I want a drink, see you,
and see you for something to eat.

05:54.162 --> 05:54.794
Cheers.

05:54.862 --> 05:56.162
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

05:56.765 --> 05:57.330
Oh, yeah.

05:57.399 --> 05:57.964
That's good.

05:58.033 --> 05:59.366
- Have a nice time.
- I will.

05:59.434 --> 06:00.033
Thanks a lot.

06:00.102 --> 06:00.467
Cheers.

06:00.536 --> 06:01.401
Come back here.

06:01.470 --> 06:03.170
If I want a drink or something.

06:03.239 --> 06:04.205
My name's sharif.

06:04.274 --> 06:05.006
He's sharif.

06:05.074 --> 06:05.640
No, no.

06:05.708 --> 06:07.075
My name's sharif, Omar sharif.

06:07.143 --> 06:07.876
Omar sharif.

06:07.945 --> 06:08.710
He's sharif.

06:08.779 --> 06:10.846
Omar sharif.

06:10.914 --> 06:13.215
I'll pop in there if I'm hungry.

06:22.079 --> 06:23.978
I'm not hungry at the moment.

06:24.047 --> 06:24.780
All right.

06:24.848 --> 06:26.448
Honestly, it's all right.

06:26.516 --> 06:27.949
Yeah, it's all right.

06:28.018 --> 06:29.784
What do you want, a drink?

06:29.853 --> 06:31.552
I'm just walking through.

06:31.621 --> 06:33.027
If I get thirsty, I'll pop by.

06:36.951 --> 06:38.159
Do you know what?

06:38.227 --> 06:39.660
I'm not hungry at the moment.

06:39.729 --> 06:41.562
- -Yes?
- Yeah, I was back there.

06:41.630 --> 06:42.523
I sort of got off
food a little bit.

06:42.643 --> 06:43.902
I'm okay at the moment.

06:44.022 --> 06:45.718
Thanks a lot.

06:45.838 --> 06:47.225
Cheers.

06:47.851 --> 06:49.500
[Bleep]

06:57.604 --> 06:59.572
I've already got some.

06:59.692 --> 07:01.073
Don't smoke.

07:01.142 --> 07:03.109
If I wanted a watch,
I'd buy one off you.

07:03.177 --> 07:04.477
Don't need.

07:04.545 --> 07:06.045
It's for a woman.

07:06.114 --> 07:10.950
My girlfriend's head
is slightly bigger.

07:11.018 --> 07:13.786
I don't need any glasses.

07:13.854 --> 07:17.156
[Bleep]

07:17.225 --> 07:19.992
If there's one thing that's done
me head in since I've been here,

07:20.061 --> 07:20.693
it's all this.

07:20.762 --> 07:21.894
You can't walk down there.

07:21.963 --> 07:24.931
Forget, like, just using it as a cut
through, 'cause it's not a shortcut.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.968
It can't be a shortcut, 'cause you
get stopped every few seconds.

07:29.037 --> 07:31.404
Yeah, all right.

07:31.605 --> 07:34.540
So, I mean, I bet she left
the house when she was 10.

07:34.609 --> 07:39.111
I'll tell you, seriously, it takes you
forever to get anything done here.

07:41.489 --> 07:42.840
Hi.

07:44.205 --> 07:46.390
Didn't sleep at all.

07:51.737 --> 07:54.704
I'm gonna go over and
see the pyramids today.

07:54.773 --> 07:56.773
That's the plan.
That's why I'm in Egypt, isn't it?

07:56.842 --> 07:59.042
I mean, I wish I could
have seen them sooner.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.979
You know, the sooner I see them,
the sooner I can go home, but,

08:02.048 --> 08:05.917
yeah, Steve's sorted out some
local bloke who's got a camel.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.182
He's gonna take me over
there on one of them.

08:11.291 --> 08:14.159
When I was younger, I got on
a horse, and someone sort of

08:14.227 --> 08:15.327
burned the horse's ass.

08:15.395 --> 08:18.628
It bolted, and I was on it
and falling off the edge.

08:18.748 --> 08:22.300
So I've always said I'd never go on any
animal that's sort of bigger than me.

08:22.972 --> 08:26.327
So it's a little bit crazy, but it seems
to be the way they get around here anyway.

08:26.446 --> 08:29.650
They're all using
donkeys and camels.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.922
So as long as nobody is neighbour
with a fag end,

08:32.042 --> 08:33.970
it should be alright, really.

08:34.546 --> 08:36.235
It's crazy here, though, isn't it?

08:36.355 --> 08:38.366
It's the non-touristy
bit, isn't it?

08:38.486 --> 08:40.145
This is what it's all about.

08:40.265 --> 08:43.114
So, yeah, I'm meeting this fella.

08:44.681 --> 08:47.414
Need to use his toilet straightaway.
Is that rude?

08:47.483 --> 08:49.161
No, it should be all right.

08:52.379 --> 08:53.832
- Mahmoud.
- Hi.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.067
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

08:55.136 --> 08:56.736
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.472
I'm Karl. Welcome.

08:59.541 --> 09:01.508
Come in. How you doing?

09:01.576 --> 09:03.676
Do you mind if I use
your toilet quickly?

09:03.745 --> 09:07.681
It's just that I've drank a
lot of coffee this morning.

09:07.749 --> 09:09.125
That's my family here.

09:09.245 --> 09:10.284
Hello.

09:10.353 --> 09:11.252
Who's that?

09:11.320 --> 09:12.153
Cooking tea.

09:12.221 --> 09:13.587
Is that your girlfriend?

09:13.656 --> 09:14.689
She's my mother.

09:14.757 --> 09:15.656
Your mother!

09:15.725 --> 09:16.691
Come on, man.

09:16.759 --> 09:18.159
She's not your mother.

09:18.228 --> 09:19.593
She is.

09:19.662 --> 09:21.228
Can I ask how old she is?

09:21.297 --> 09:24.899
She's 38.

09:24.967 --> 09:25.966
She is my mother.

09:26.035 --> 09:29.169
In our family, we marry
when we're very young.

09:29.238 --> 09:30.070
How old are you?

09:30.139 --> 09:31.864
I'm 22, and I have child.

09:37.412 --> 09:39.813
I needed that.

09:39.882 --> 09:42.516
Much better.

09:42.584 --> 09:44.151
That's me and my wife.

09:44.219 --> 09:45.919
Is that it now for life?

09:45.988 --> 09:47.321
Are you settled now?

09:47.389 --> 09:49.123
You'll stay with this woman?

09:49.191 --> 09:50.657
I can have one if I want.

09:50.726 --> 09:53.595
If feel like I want
one, then I can.

09:53.663 --> 09:55.296
Four women.

09:55.365 --> 09:56.799
You're allowed four women?

09:56.867 --> 09:59.835
Yes, four women I can
have if I want to.

09:59.904 --> 10:03.439
But I'm happy until now, but I
don't know what's gonna happen.

10:03.507 --> 10:04.573
Pace yourself.

10:04.642 --> 10:06.809
I mean, you're only 22.

10:06.878 --> 10:08.744
Spread it out a
little bit, you know.

10:08.813 --> 10:14.884
Do you know, like, how snow white had,
like, a happy... miserable one.

10:14.953 --> 10:16.953
She had, like, a mixture.

10:17.420 --> 10:20.690
Would you go for a totally
different woman so that if

10:20.759 --> 10:25.261
you're in the mood for someone to be
happy, you go, "Oh, I'll see her today"?

10:25.330 --> 10:26.495
Yes.

10:26.564 --> 10:30.699
Life is too short, man.

10:30.768 --> 10:32.468
One, two, three.

10:32.537 --> 10:33.936
Hang on a minute.

10:34.005 --> 10:35.438
Hold on tight on here.

10:37.742 --> 10:40.643
Whoa!

10:40.712 --> 10:42.511
Bloody high up, this, isn't it?

10:42.580 --> 10:44.013
All right.

10:44.082 --> 10:45.615
You just need to hold well.

10:45.683 --> 10:49.118
I'm holding on.

10:49.187 --> 10:51.520
Hi.

10:51.589 --> 10:52.388
I'm holding on.

10:59.396 --> 11:06.936
Me bollocks are squashed.

11:10.876 --> 11:12.175
Is that you or the camel?

11:12.244 --> 11:12.742
Huh?

11:12.811 --> 11:13.643
Is that you?

11:13.712 --> 11:14.244
What?

11:14.313 --> 11:15.279
That sounded human.

11:15.347 --> 11:17.147
That's the camel, man.

11:17.216 --> 11:21.852
Well, you know, rocking left
and right makes things happen.

11:21.921 --> 11:25.355
What you've got to remember is,
I'm getting the back draft.

11:32.164 --> 11:33.063
How are you doing?

11:33.132 --> 11:35.166
Hi.

11:35.235 --> 11:37.735
It's chronic, isn't it, today?

11:37.804 --> 11:40.971
Can't even see the pyramids.

11:41.040 --> 11:46.010
Come all this way, and
that's the view you get.

11:46.078 --> 11:49.713
I mean, the idea is now that I
stand there and I'm blown away.

11:49.782 --> 11:51.749
That's what's meant
to happen, isn't it?

11:51.818 --> 11:55.486
I mean, I am getting blown away, but
mainly by the wind that's going on there.

11:55.555 --> 11:57.455
We got a sand storm, and
I've got sand in me eyes.

11:57.524 --> 12:01.092
I can't see anything anyway,
even if it was a clear day.

12:01.161 --> 12:02.160
It's a bit annoying.

12:02.228 --> 12:06.364
You know, I thought it would
feel more special than this.

12:10.936 --> 12:12.736
I keep getting messages from home.

12:12.805 --> 12:15.205
I mean, Susan's moaning
about the boiler again.

12:15.274 --> 12:17.408
That's starting to play up.

12:17.476 --> 12:19.710
Normally that's my problem,
but now I'm away.

12:19.779 --> 12:21.012
I've made it her problem.

12:21.081 --> 12:26.218
And them I'm also getting messages...
I'll show you this one, from Ricky.

12:26.286 --> 12:29.688
He just keeps sending stuff 'cause he
knows it costs me money to receive them.

12:29.757 --> 12:32.191
There's just something on there.

12:32.260 --> 12:34.461
70 pounds.

12:34.529 --> 12:37.175
'Cause he knows that it's cost me
about 70p for him to send that.

12:37.295 --> 12:39.232
There's nothing else in there.
He's not asking, "How are you?"

12:39.301 --> 12:40.500
You know?
"What are you up to?

12:40.569 --> 12:41.267
What have you seen?

12:41.336 --> 12:42.101
Are you enjoying it?"

12:42.170 --> 12:43.802
"70p."

12:43.871 --> 12:46.738
That's all he said.

12:56.914 --> 12:58.515
So why are you wearing this?

12:58.583 --> 13:00.183
This is comfy wear, isn't it?

13:00.252 --> 13:02.886
I mean, this is like pajamas
at the end of the day.

13:02.955 --> 13:06.857
I mean, the problem is, I've been
getting mossie bites and stuff.

13:06.926 --> 13:09.960
So I wanted something with sort
of long sleeves on it to sort of

13:10.028 --> 13:12.629
keep them away.

13:12.698 --> 13:13.797
It's just comfy.

13:13.866 --> 13:15.199
Loads of room in it.

13:15.268 --> 13:19.804
Normally pajamas sort of roll up your
arms and legs and that, but this is...

13:19.873 --> 13:22.006
You know, it's all
right, isn't it?

13:22.207 --> 13:24.175
I mean, that's the good
thing if you lived here.

13:24.244 --> 13:26.477
You could just sort of... if
you start work at 9:00, you

13:26.546 --> 13:29.380
could get out of bed about
five to, keep it on.

13:29.449 --> 13:30.548
Straight off.

13:35.554 --> 13:36.687
Steve sent me a text.

13:36.756 --> 13:38.722
It said meet up with
a lad called Achmed.

13:38.791 --> 13:40.891
He's gonna show me
around the place.

13:42.962 --> 13:44.128
Good work.

13:47.313 --> 13:49.147
Now here, there's a gap.
What do you reckon?

13:49.267 --> 13:51.336
- Now.
- Yeah?

13:52.722 --> 13:54.025
- Good job.
- Easy.

13:54.145 --> 13:55.705
Now you're egyptian.

13:55.774 --> 14:01.578
Brilliant.

14:01.647 --> 14:03.346
Oh, wow.

14:03.415 --> 14:06.549
If you saw that at home, you'd
presume it was a pet shop.

14:06.618 --> 14:07.751
What's a pet shop?

14:07.819 --> 14:08.285
Oh.

14:08.353 --> 14:09.019
No, no, no.

14:09.088 --> 14:11.221
That's for food, only for food.

14:11.290 --> 14:14.459
So, when you look at that, do you
go, "Mmm," rather than "Aww."

14:14.527 --> 14:15.626
Well, yeah.

14:15.695 --> 14:18.563
We eat them.

14:26.540 --> 14:27.540
What's this stuff?

14:27.609 --> 14:28.441
Cotton.

14:28.510 --> 14:29.408
Feel?

14:29.477 --> 14:31.610
Egyptian cotton.

14:31.679 --> 14:33.612
So what would people do with this?

14:33.681 --> 14:34.513
For mattresses.

14:34.581 --> 14:39.050
I could do with that,
actually, at the hotel.

14:39.119 --> 14:39.750
Right.

14:39.819 --> 14:42.253
We'll do a bit of
practice about haggling.

14:42.321 --> 14:45.088
You need to haggle, otherwise,
you will get ripped off.

14:45.157 --> 14:45.689
Hang on.

14:45.758 --> 14:46.790
So I come in your shop.

14:46.859 --> 14:47.491
I'm browsing.

14:47.559 --> 14:48.425
I'm looking around.

14:48.493 --> 14:48.958
Right.

14:49.027 --> 14:52.663
This is the finest piece we have,
and it's for 100... 100 english.

14:52.731 --> 14:53.964
Seems a bit expensive, that.

14:54.033 --> 14:57.502
Now you need to tell me... you
need to tell me... just reduce it.

14:57.570 --> 14:59.637
You say 10.

14:59.706 --> 15:01.106
So you want me to buy
the water, then?

15:01.174 --> 15:02.474
I didn't really come
in here for that.

15:02.543 --> 15:04.241
I came here for an
ashtray, for a present.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.345
Do you sell ashtrays?

15:06.414 --> 15:08.002
No.

15:08.122 --> 15:09.992
Okay.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.384
Have you got an ashtray?

15:12.452 --> 15:13.051
No, no, no.

15:13.120 --> 15:13.451
No?

15:13.520 --> 15:14.352
I'll leave you then.

15:15.155 --> 15:15.587
Right.

15:15.655 --> 15:16.221
I'd sack you.

15:16.289 --> 15:18.056
If you had a shop, I
would get rid of you.

15:18.124 --> 15:23.059
If I owned the shop and you
worked in there, that's rubbish.

15:23.128 --> 15:26.096
Hey, my friend, how can
I take your money?

15:28.533 --> 15:30.666
$1,000 sale, please.

15:31.869 --> 15:33.102
Welcome to Cairo.

15:33.171 --> 15:35.338
Welcome.

15:35.406 --> 15:36.239
You lost me.

15:36.307 --> 15:37.540
I will go lower than 160.

15:37.609 --> 15:38.574
160 is nothing.

15:38.643 --> 15:39.542
What about 90?

15:40.412 --> 15:41.844
You want to get it for free?

15:41.913 --> 15:42.845
Eh, never mind.

15:42.914 --> 15:46.549
You are a very clever guy, but
I don't agree with your price.

15:46.618 --> 15:47.617
Egyptian wool.

15:47.685 --> 15:48.284
Egyptian.

15:48.353 --> 15:48.851
120.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.420
I thought you agreed 110.

15:50.489 --> 15:52.222
No, I said 120 for you.

15:52.290 --> 15:54.457
Do I get money off
with the nose missing?

15:54.526 --> 15:56.392
No.

16:03.553 --> 16:06.001
Well, I've been out all day, you
know, seeing how the locals

16:06.070 --> 16:07.436
live, which is what
it's all about.

16:07.505 --> 16:10.172
Thought the day was coming to an
end, thought I'd be able to, you

16:10.240 --> 16:12.708
know, relax a little bit, and I
just got a message from Ricky

16:12.777 --> 16:15.277
and Steve saying they sorted out
a place for something to eat

16:15.346 --> 16:21.652
tonight, which is
a bit of a worry.

16:21.720 --> 16:25.490
I'll get you the special of the
day, typical egyptian food.

16:25.558 --> 16:26.324
Cheers.

16:26.393 --> 16:29.227
Thanks a lot.

16:29.296 --> 16:30.395
It's a bit annoying.

16:30.464 --> 16:32.430
He's just cooking
something for me.

16:32.499 --> 16:37.969
I don't know what it is.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.005
I don't like hummus that much.

16:40.073 --> 16:44.109
Hummus, couscous... anything like that,
I just don't have that sort of stuff.

16:44.177 --> 16:44.909
It's not a meal.

16:44.978 --> 16:48.112
It's a garnish.

16:48.181 --> 16:52.583
I would have loved just
chicken and chips.

16:52.652 --> 16:56.555
Just something not
too challenging.

16:56.624 --> 16:57.489
I just want a meal.

16:57.558 --> 17:01.226
I'm hungry.

17:01.295 --> 17:03.328
I never experimented
that much with food.

17:03.397 --> 17:10.636
I've had pasta until
I was about 21, 22.

17:10.704 --> 17:11.869
All right.

17:11.939 --> 17:16.775
Brilliant.

17:16.844 --> 17:20.878
I got a bit of a taste of that at the
end, and I'm sure I knew what it was.

17:20.948 --> 17:22.114
I'll have a bit again.

17:22.182 --> 17:24.194
I'm sure I've had it before.
Okay.

17:27.253 --> 17:28.461
- It's Rubbery.
- Rubbery.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.189
Chewy.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.258
Corn beefy.

17:33.326 --> 17:34.726
How about testicle?

17:34.794 --> 17:36.127
That's a testicle?

17:36.196 --> 17:38.296
Uh-huh.

17:38.365 --> 17:44.702
And the chewy one, penis.

17:44.771 --> 17:48.206
Normally on Monday, probably
have a little bit of lamb that's

17:48.275 --> 17:51.543
leftover from Sunday dinner or
something, and yet, you know,

17:51.611 --> 17:53.711
this Monday night [bleep]

17:53.780 --> 18:00.318
Bollocks, couple of eyes, a bit
of tongue, you know, for garnish.

18:00.387 --> 18:02.588
I never thought I'd
be saying that.

18:02.656 --> 18:05.157
It's supposed to be
good for you as a male.

18:05.226 --> 18:08.027
But why do you use
everything to that degree?

18:08.096 --> 18:09.962
We kind of eat everything.

18:10.031 --> 18:11.564
Nothing goes to waste.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.766
Besides, it's delicious.

18:13.835 --> 18:16.001
Yeah, I said... well, I
didn't say delicious.

18:16.070 --> 18:17.102
I didn't say delicious.

18:17.171 --> 18:19.416
You put words in me mouth,
along with other things.

18:26.227 --> 18:27.312
Hello?

18:27.381 --> 18:28.947
Hello?

18:29.921 --> 18:31.186
What?

18:34.923 --> 18:36.644
It's, uh...

18:37.283 --> 18:38.413
Can you hear that?

18:40.495 --> 18:43.031
There's just car horns
and that, constant.

18:49.072 --> 18:50.205
Oh, God!

18:50.274 --> 18:52.344
Anyway, the hotel's
pretty depressing.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.580
What, the little... little hat?

19:08.622 --> 19:11.110
No, I wasn't planning
on sort of rushing out.

19:14.508 --> 19:17.466
Yeah, but I told you, when in Rome,
I'm happy to go along with it.

19:17.535 --> 19:18.935
I'll eat pasta.

19:21.673 --> 19:26.710
But when in Egypt...
They don't say, do they,

19:26.830 --> 19:28.820
"When in Egypt, have a
bollock for lunch"?

19:33.153 --> 19:34.786
See you later.

19:34.855 --> 19:36.120
Yeah.

19:45.445 --> 19:50.300
When Michael Palin goes working
around the world, is this what

19:50.369 --> 19:51.401
it's like for him?

19:51.521 --> 19:54.004
Has he got racket going
on like that outside?

19:54.072 --> 19:56.531
Has he got mates calling
him up, annoying him?

20:00.026 --> 20:03.081
I mean, when Palin went around
the world in 80 days, I wonder

20:03.150 --> 20:06.418
if that was a scheduled time or if
he just said, "I'm sick of this.

20:06.487 --> 20:07.497
Can we speed it up?"

20:18.417 --> 20:19.283
Is that better?

20:19.403 --> 20:22.920
I don't know.

20:26.691 --> 20:29.826
I'd be quite happy going
home now, honestly.

20:29.894 --> 20:31.227
You know, I've been
here a few days.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.363
All right, I haven't seen the
pyramids yet, but I bet most of

20:33.432 --> 20:35.432
the locals haven't, 'cause
that's what happens, isn't it,

20:35.501 --> 20:36.300
when you live somewhere?

20:36.368 --> 20:38.202
You don't bother seeing the
sort of touristy stuff.

20:38.271 --> 20:41.873
I haven't even seen
Buckingham Palace yet.

20:41.942 --> 20:43.041
The weather's bad, isn't it?

20:43.110 --> 20:43.909
So what then to do?

20:43.977 --> 20:44.943
Do you know what I mean?

20:45.012 --> 20:48.180
So I'm just killing time,
really, till it clears up.

20:48.248 --> 20:52.584
Steve started out with Achmed to
show me around the museum, which

20:52.653 --> 20:53.551
apparently is world-famous.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.385
That's what Steve said.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.120
And I was like, "What do
you mean, world-famous?"

20:56.189 --> 20:56.954
He's like, "Yeah, yeah.

20:57.023 --> 20:57.955
It's a world-famous museum."

20:58.023 --> 20:59.289
And I said, "I haven't
heard of it."

20:59.358 --> 21:01.191
He said, "What do you mean,
you haven't heard of it?"

21:01.260 --> 21:02.793
I said, "I haven't heard of it."

21:02.861 --> 21:06.496
So, Karl, I would like you to
join on a journey through time.

21:06.565 --> 21:11.033
The moment we walk in, a long history
splendor and mystery will be unfolding.

21:11.102 --> 21:13.069
I will breathe life into history.

21:13.138 --> 21:16.506
So, I'm not looking forward to
going 'round it, to be honest.

21:16.575 --> 21:19.343
I mean, I don't go to museums
at home, so I don't see what

21:19.412 --> 21:21.779
difference it makes just
'cause it's in Egypt.

21:21.848 --> 21:25.450
So you have clockwise from
predynastic to early dynastic,

21:25.519 --> 21:28.153
old kingdom, middle
kingdom, new kingdom.

21:28.222 --> 21:29.221
So look here.

21:29.290 --> 21:30.990
The pharaoh is harpooning.

21:31.058 --> 21:32.491
9 years old boy king.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.393
You cannot see the
hippo he's harpooning.

21:35.462 --> 21:36.160
Why not?

21:36.229 --> 21:37.094
This is the magic.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.597
Because with magic, that
hippo will come into life.

21:39.666 --> 21:43.601
So, again, coffin within a coffin,
sarcophagus within a sarcophagus.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.069
You can see the cartouche.

21:45.138 --> 21:48.072
The cartouche is the name of
the pharaoh, the boy king.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.875
At some point, he was
bringing back a pigmy.

21:51.944 --> 21:52.843
Was it a portrait?

21:52.911 --> 21:54.778
Can you avoid
portraying the pharaoh?

21:54.847 --> 21:59.016
This is very hard, of course, to reconcile,
'cause the soul will be searching.

21:59.084 --> 22:02.419
The Ka wants to find the pharaoh,
the boy king tutankhamen.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.788
Yes, you have the cartouche with the
boy king, but it helps even more...

22:05.857 --> 22:08.825
Coming in here with Achmed, it's
like a kid in a sweets shop.

22:08.894 --> 22:12.729
It's just... show you
this, show you that.

22:12.798 --> 22:13.263
It's mental.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.364
And you can't take it all in.

22:14.433 --> 22:18.135
It's like going Christmas shopping on,
you know, Christmas Eve in a department

22:18.204 --> 22:18.502
store.

22:18.571 --> 22:19.503
There's too much going on.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.571
There's too much to look at.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.040
There's too many people.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.575
You're being pushed along.

22:23.643 --> 22:24.976
It's a nightmare.

22:25.045 --> 22:28.647
I want to call it a day here
and get back to, I don't know,

22:28.716 --> 22:30.615
eating [bleep] bollocks again.

22:30.684 --> 22:35.486
Seems more fun than this to me.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.655
That just seems to me
like a bit over the top.

22:37.723 --> 22:41.958
A lot of gold, a bit sort
of Pete Stringfellowish.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.495
It's exactly the same as me aunt
Nora's house with ornaments.

22:45.563 --> 22:48.731
She keeps buying one and then
she has to buy a new shelf to

22:48.800 --> 22:49.966
put the ornaments up.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.836
It's like I haven't got enough
room to buy another shelf.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.237
She fills that and another.

22:54.306 --> 22:57.742
And that's what I'm saying about
Achmed saying they're expanding it.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.278
You know, yeah, they say they're
expanding it so more people can

23:00.346 --> 23:03.380
get in, but you know for the fact,
"Oh, you've got more room, have you?

23:03.449 --> 23:04.615
Bring some more in.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.202
Get digging again."

23:23.386 --> 23:24.854
It's just the same.

23:24.922 --> 23:27.223
Can I get two pieces of chicken?

23:27.292 --> 23:28.573
Two.

23:31.630 --> 23:32.362
What?

23:32.430 --> 23:34.795
It's a kfc for deaf people.

23:36.297 --> 23:38.208
So what do I have to do?
I don't understand.

23:38.328 --> 23:39.513
Me to point?

23:40.081 --> 23:41.792
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:43.129 --> 23:44.096
One, yeah.

23:44.366 --> 23:45.688
One of them.

23:46.015 --> 23:47.006
One.

23:47.532 --> 23:49.181
Original.

23:50.713 --> 23:52.346
I don't quite know
what's going on here.

23:52.466 --> 23:53.569
Are they all deaf?

23:56.555 --> 23:58.275
Can... you can you hear me?

24:00.222 --> 24:03.323
Can you hear me?

24:03.392 --> 24:05.192
Hello?

24:05.261 --> 24:06.026
No.

24:06.095 --> 24:08.410
They're all deaf.

24:11.299 --> 24:12.332
Thanks a lot.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.768
Brilliant.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.608
It's good.

24:20.677 --> 24:22.310
Good idea.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.304
What, to have a deaf kfc?

24:24.589 --> 24:27.265
Well, yeah, 'cause why not?

24:27.385 --> 24:29.262
You know, I don't come
in here for a chat.

24:29.382 --> 24:31.571
You come in here for
food, fast food.

24:31.691 --> 24:34.414
I'm taking it'll be even faster 'cause
they're not chatting behind there.

24:34.534 --> 24:36.122
***

24:36.242 --> 24:38.525
***

24:38.856 --> 24:39.814
you know, it's quick.

24:39.883 --> 24:41.416
It's there in front of you.

24:41.484 --> 24:46.020
Point, bang, done, out.

24:46.089 --> 24:47.622
It's amazing, isn't it?

24:47.691 --> 24:51.593
I mean, with technology, most of it,
you don't really use it, do you?

24:51.661 --> 24:52.994
It's kind of like a toy.

24:53.063 --> 24:56.165
Seeing them use it sort of
makes you realize it's a good

24:56.233 --> 25:00.436
invention, video calling and
picture messaging, but when

25:00.504 --> 25:04.707
Ricky sends me a picture,
it's that sort of thing.

25:04.775 --> 25:06.575
So, this is what I'm saying.

25:06.644 --> 25:09.412
We don't sort of use it properly.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.427
They've got a proper use.

25:14.752 --> 25:16.413
Do you know what I mean?

25:31.559 --> 25:34.561
I'd say that's the most annoying
thing about being in this place,

25:34.630 --> 25:37.397
just being hassled all the time,
no matter where you are, no

25:37.466 --> 25:38.832
matter what time of day it is.

25:38.901 --> 25:41.075
They're just constantly
hassling you.

25:41.686 --> 25:44.972
Deaf lad sort of tapped me on the
back, gave me a bit of paper.

25:45.041 --> 25:48.276
Couldn't read it 'cause
it was all in arabic.

25:48.345 --> 25:51.731
And pointed, just said
it's a charity thing.

25:53.421 --> 25:56.208
And I went and gave him
100 egyptian pounds.

25:56.328 --> 25:58.087
So he got 12 quid off me.

25:58.156 --> 25:59.960
He didn't even look that happy.

26:00.525 --> 26:02.651
I'll be spent by the
end of tonight.

26:04.784 --> 26:07.730
Spent a load of time with
some deaf people in kfc.

26:07.799 --> 26:08.859
They were nice.

26:08.979 --> 26:10.467
I don't know if he was deaf.

26:10.535 --> 26:12.268
That's the thing with
that one, isn't it?

26:12.337 --> 26:15.772
It's not like all the other disabilities,
where you can go, "Is he lying?"

26:15.840 --> 26:20.143
You know, you can see if someone's got a
leg missing or are blind or something.

26:20.211 --> 26:23.145
But with him...
"Oh, that's terrible.

26:23.214 --> 26:25.099
Here you go. Have some money."

26:26.559 --> 26:29.251
Me mum's the same.
I think that's who I get it off.

26:30.038 --> 26:32.422
With that said, she walked up to
some fella

26:32.490 --> 26:34.457
who she thought was a big-issue seller

26:34.713 --> 26:37.207
who stood there with
the magazine like that in his hands.

26:37.436 --> 26:38.202
She walked up.

26:38.270 --> 26:39.358
She said, "It's all right.
You can keep the magazine."

26:39.478 --> 26:40.567
Gave him a quid.

26:40.687 --> 26:43.595
Turns out that was just a fella
stood outside, going places with

26:43.715 --> 26:45.022
a holiday brochure in his hand.

26:45.391 --> 26:46.678
He kept it.

26:48.848 --> 26:50.348
Hi.

26:51.884 --> 26:52.650
Yeah. Hi, mate.

26:52.719 --> 26:53.741
How's it going?

26:58.358 --> 26:59.591
Yeah, but I seen that.

26:59.659 --> 27:01.292
I went to the millennium dome.

27:01.361 --> 27:03.500
I saw... it's all the same stuff.

27:08.268 --> 27:09.244
Go on.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.513
It's just not the
sort of night at all.

27:21.582 --> 27:24.183
It's just not the sort of
entertainment thing to do for me.

27:24.252 --> 27:27.286
It's nice going down any river on
a boat, but I'd do it in the day.

27:27.355 --> 27:28.888
At night it's pointless.

27:28.956 --> 27:30.456
You can't see anything.

27:30.525 --> 27:35.462
And it's that thing that's like, you
know you're there for a couple of hours.

27:35.530 --> 27:37.797
There's no getting away from it.

27:37.866 --> 27:43.737
So they could do anything
once you're on there.

27:46.476 --> 27:49.744
Had some entertainment, someone
whizzing 'round and 'round and 'round.

27:49.812 --> 27:54.482
He starts off... he's got, like, a quilt
around him, and he starts spinning.

27:54.551 --> 27:58.020
And it was only that he'd been spinning
for about three minutes, and I thought,

27:58.088 --> 27:59.655
"Actually, it's pretty difficult.

27:59.723 --> 28:01.156
He's just been spinning.

28:01.225 --> 28:06.762
He'll be getting dizzy in a bit."

28:06.831 --> 28:07.796
And it went on for ages.

28:07.865 --> 28:10.632
It's not the sort of thing you have
to watch whilst he's doing it.

28:10.701 --> 28:12.233
You just glance
over now and again.

28:12.302 --> 28:13.234
"Oh, he's still going."

28:13.303 --> 28:16.471
And I'm having a bit of turkey.

28:16.540 --> 28:18.173
Bit of a waste of energy, though.

28:18.241 --> 28:21.442
It would have been good if, at
the end, he said, "And thanks

28:21.511 --> 28:22.643
to, you know, Terry.

28:22.712 --> 28:25.880
He's been whizzing 'round, and
because of that, that energy

28:25.948 --> 28:28.016
he's created is at
the oven working.

28:28.084 --> 28:31.586
We've got more food," or just
something to make it seem more

28:31.654 --> 28:34.689
impressive than it was.

28:34.757 --> 28:39.560
But the colors and that were good, and
he sort of kept the room quite cool.

28:39.629 --> 28:41.495
You know, it's quite hot in there.

28:41.564 --> 28:44.932
So you got him wafting
about, creating a draft.

28:56.178 --> 28:58.645
I didn't know what was going
on with the comedian.

28:58.714 --> 28:59.746
I mean, jokes, anyway.

28:59.815 --> 29:02.816
Even if he spoke english, humor's
different everywhere you go.

29:06.756 --> 29:08.055
It was a terrible night.

29:08.124 --> 29:09.257
I mean, I hated it.

29:09.326 --> 29:12.694
It's not my sort of
thing at all, that.

29:12.763 --> 29:15.731
When I got up and was dancing...
'Cause I did it just 'cause I

29:15.799 --> 29:19.401
thought, "Well, I'm here now, and Ricky
and Steve don't want me to do it.

29:19.470 --> 29:20.536
They know I hate it."

29:20.605 --> 29:22.672
So I thought, "I might
as well enjoy it."

29:22.740 --> 29:24.273
So I got up and had a dance.

29:31.014 --> 29:37.785
And she told me that, you know, I was
the best dancer she'd ever seen.

29:37.854 --> 29:39.379
Not bad, is it?

29:56.173 --> 29:58.240
Traffic's horrendous.

29:59.677 --> 30:01.978
Just... like, it's not
just the traffic.

30:02.046 --> 30:04.180
It's just beeping.

30:04.249 --> 30:06.282
But it just seems to be like
people letting onto each other

30:06.351 --> 30:08.018
at 4:00 in the morning.

30:08.086 --> 30:09.085
Now go home.

30:09.154 --> 30:10.438
What are you doing?

30:12.757 --> 30:24.267
So, I reckon I've had about... I
reckon I've had about an hour's kip.

30:24.336 --> 30:27.971
I mean, that's somewhat
like an egyptian.

30:28.040 --> 30:29.105
No one's walking.

30:29.174 --> 30:33.243
Everyone seems to be in a car
at all hours, just beeping.

30:46.823 --> 30:47.656
It's not enough, is it?

30:47.726 --> 30:52.028
It's not enough to say something's
amazing just 'cause they're old.

30:52.096 --> 30:54.363
'Cause you can get an old person
who's done that all their life.

30:54.432 --> 30:55.430
He wouldn't go, "I'm amazing."

30:55.499 --> 30:57.732
He'd go, "No [bleep]"

30:57.801 --> 31:02.469
So age shouldn't really
make something special.

31:02.538 --> 31:06.073
I'm not worrying about who built them,
'cause it was ages ago, really.

31:06.142 --> 31:09.543
When I first bought me first house,
I didn't go, "Who built it?"

31:09.612 --> 31:11.178
I want to know, is it safe?

31:11.247 --> 31:14.214
Is it structurally sound?

31:14.283 --> 31:18.719
Is it haunted?

31:18.787 --> 31:22.857
Whoa!

31:22.925 --> 31:24.358
What's the rush?

31:24.427 --> 31:26.193
It's been here for 4,000 years.

31:26.262 --> 31:30.031
What's he doing?

31:30.099 --> 31:32.200
Aah! Me ass!

31:32.269 --> 31:35.136
This is mental.

31:44.815 --> 31:49.786
Just a lot of [bleep]

31:49.855 --> 31:51.388
You don't normally see
any of this, do you?

31:51.457 --> 31:52.822
You don't see that
many buses there.

31:52.891 --> 31:57.426
It looks like it's right in the
middle of, like, a nice desert...

31:57.495 --> 31:58.594
But it isn't, is it?

31:58.663 --> 32:00.930
It's just a building site.

32:00.998 --> 32:05.834
I'm half tempted to... I mean, it's
not even bits of old pyramid, is it?

32:05.903 --> 32:07.936
You've got all sorts of...
You've got bricks here from,

32:08.004 --> 32:09.604
like, council houses and that.

32:09.672 --> 32:15.910
It's literally just people have brought
all [bleep] and dumped it here.

32:15.979 --> 32:19.515
It's actually like "Planet
of the Apes," isn't it?

32:19.583 --> 32:21.951
Barren.

32:27.926 --> 32:32.030
It's like a little
tornado, isn't it?

32:32.098 --> 32:35.766
You don't see that in
the brochure, do you?

32:35.835 --> 32:37.769
[Bleep] old nappy
whizzing through the air.

32:37.837 --> 32:40.038
Tend to leave that out.

32:40.106 --> 32:43.007
You see, I've always
wanted to see a tornado.

32:43.076 --> 32:46.177
That is on me wish list before
I die, 'cause it's natural.

32:46.246 --> 32:50.648
It's a natural thing
that I don't understand.

32:59.757 --> 33:03.327
If that was like a little housing
estate, you'd go, "Yeah, any will do."

33:03.395 --> 33:04.762
Are they all the same size?

33:04.830 --> 33:07.064
The design actually is
a bit odd, isn't it?

33:07.133 --> 33:12.002
'Cause the square footage, the
floor size, is massive, but the

33:12.070 --> 33:14.937
upstairs bit is tiny.

33:39.863 --> 33:45.602
The great pyramid was built by atlantian
survivors with extraterrestrial help.

33:45.671 --> 33:49.740
And they built the pyramid with
the help of sound, because sound

33:49.809 --> 33:53.710
was used very much in Atlantis.

33:53.779 --> 33:57.247
Well, Andrew and Seija were just saying
that they use the pyramids at night.

33:57.315 --> 33:59.882
They just nip in there to do
some meditation, what have you.

33:59.951 --> 34:03.285
So they said I can go with them,
but I've got to learn to do some

34:03.354 --> 34:04.253
meditation first.

34:04.322 --> 34:07.622
So they've just given
me some words to learn.

34:07.691 --> 34:10.025
Once I've done that, they
said they'll tap me in.

34:10.092 --> 34:12.726
So, that seems fair
enough, doesn't it?

34:17.668 --> 34:20.335
They're washing up
before we do this.

34:20.405 --> 34:22.038
Leave the washing up, Seija.

34:22.107 --> 34:24.507
It's spoiling the mood a bit.

34:24.577 --> 34:25.876
Leave this.

34:25.945 --> 34:26.610
Yeah.

34:29.649 --> 34:33.016
If you open that door, I
just put those there.

34:33.085 --> 34:33.885
This is madness.

34:33.953 --> 34:37.688
Gandhi wouldn't have washed
up before he starts.

34:41.293 --> 34:44.527
Can't escape noise in here.

34:50.934 --> 34:52.668
How long's this gonna go on now?

34:52.737 --> 34:53.837
Couple of minutes.

34:53.905 --> 34:55.739
Two, three minutes.

34:55.808 --> 35:00.211
It's five times a day.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.614
You might as well
finish the washing up.

35:02.682 --> 35:07.486
No rush with the
washing up, Andrew.

35:07.555 --> 35:09.288
I tell you what, I bet they
don't show you 'round the

35:09.357 --> 35:11.791
property 'round here at certain
times of the day, do they?

35:11.860 --> 35:12.658
No, probably not.

35:12.727 --> 35:13.927
When you're buying a place.

35:13.995 --> 35:14.527
"Come on.

35:14.596 --> 35:15.795
We've got to get going quick."

35:15.864 --> 35:16.162
"Why?

35:16.231 --> 35:18.431
Just let us go."

35:18.500 --> 35:21.700
You buy it, this kicks off.

35:21.769 --> 35:27.240
Unbelievable.

35:27.309 --> 35:28.608
That was a little bit
weird, wasn't it?

35:28.677 --> 35:29.176
But I liked it.

35:29.245 --> 35:30.010
Do you know what I mean?

35:30.079 --> 35:31.645
I'm into that sort of weirdness.

35:31.714 --> 35:35.248
Plus, it means that I'm actually
gonna go inside a pyramid tomorrow.

35:35.317 --> 35:38.185
It's all worth it.

35:46.361 --> 35:49.497
Got another mossie bite there.

35:49.565 --> 35:51.299
It's well itchy, that one.

35:51.367 --> 35:53.901
I think it's that same mossie.

35:53.970 --> 35:56.077
The cleaners.

35:58.366 --> 36:02.210
They haven't shown
their faces still.

36:02.411 --> 36:03.611
I don't think they
are going to now.

36:03.680 --> 36:05.813
I can't see the point.

36:12.884 --> 36:18.021
It's like a game of jenga that's
got out of hand, isn't it?

36:33.738 --> 36:35.510
Pretty high up, isn't it?

36:39.712 --> 36:45.048
I took a little bit of it, a
little bit of the pyramid.

36:45.117 --> 36:46.049
Have a look.

36:46.118 --> 36:49.520
Got a little piece.

36:49.588 --> 36:50.520
I don't think you meant to.

36:50.589 --> 36:51.121
It was loose.

36:51.190 --> 36:51.888
I didn't chip it off.

36:51.957 --> 36:53.624
It was loose anyway.

36:53.692 --> 36:57.527
It's better than the tut
that you buy, isn't it?

36:57.596 --> 37:00.363
It's better than, you know,
buying a little Egypt fellow on

37:00.432 --> 37:04.134
the back of a camel.

37:04.203 --> 37:05.136
But it's weird, isn't it?

37:05.204 --> 37:06.903
You're allowed to just
wander about on them.

37:06.972 --> 37:08.405
If this was at home,
there's no way.

37:08.474 --> 37:10.074
This would all be roped
off, wouldn't it?

37:10.142 --> 37:12.777
Wouldn't be allowed
anywhere near it.

37:12.846 --> 37:14.312
It's not treated like a wonder.

37:14.381 --> 37:19.885
It's just like a man-made
Mountain, isn't it?

37:23.858 --> 37:25.658
I'm just with Andrew
and Seija again.

37:25.726 --> 37:30.063
They're gonna teach me some more
chanting before we go in the pyramid.

37:33.769 --> 37:36.770
I don't know what's going on in her
head, but, you know, I like her.

37:36.838 --> 37:39.506
I think she believes in all the
energy thing that she's going on

37:39.574 --> 37:40.306
about, you know.

37:40.375 --> 37:45.445
I want to believe it.

37:45.514 --> 37:48.482
It would be nice if something
happens, or, you know, if I

37:48.550 --> 37:51.252
feel like a bit of
a, "What's that?"

37:51.320 --> 37:54.489
We'll see what happens.

38:22.084 --> 38:26.021
It's times like this when I think, "You
know, I used to have a proper job.

38:26.089 --> 38:27.793
What am I doing?"

38:39.671 --> 38:40.471
This is it, then.

38:40.540 --> 38:42.873
I'm actually going inside
a pyramid, which is good.

38:42.942 --> 38:44.675
I didn't even know you
could go in them.

38:44.744 --> 38:46.977
I just thought they were
like a solid structure.

38:47.046 --> 38:48.145
Do you know what I mean?

38:48.214 --> 38:49.579
Just a load of blocks.

38:49.648 --> 38:51.047
But you can go in them.

38:51.116 --> 38:53.350
So, pretty exciting, isn't it?

38:53.418 --> 39:00.456
We are now in the center of our
planet, an ancient power point.

39:15.540 --> 39:18.276
I wasn't happy about, you
know, getting in there.

39:18.344 --> 39:20.178
I'm not good in small
spaces, anyway.

39:20.246 --> 39:21.512
You know what I mean?

39:21.581 --> 39:23.915
I just was thinking,
"I don't like this."

39:26.285 --> 39:28.285
There was a dead body in there.

39:28.354 --> 39:28.919
Yeah.

39:28.988 --> 39:35.358
I've got in somewhere where some...
All them injections I had, it'll

39:35.427 --> 39:35.959
be all right.

39:36.027 --> 39:38.828
It'll cover me for that, won't it?

39:40.632 --> 39:41.797
I mean, it was all right.

39:41.866 --> 39:43.466
You know, nothing
happened, did it?

39:43.534 --> 39:48.471
You know, I got a little bit of a twinge,
but I just think that was a cramp.

39:48.540 --> 39:49.238
I don't know.

39:49.307 --> 39:51.908
She seems fed up, really,
that I didn't get anything.

39:51.976 --> 39:54.077
But there's no point
pretending, is there?

39:54.146 --> 39:56.880
That's sort of humoring her.

39:59.284 --> 40:04.722
I'll tell you what it reminded me of...
Me going to a wedding with Suzanne.

40:04.791 --> 40:06.190
She likes going to weddings.

40:06.259 --> 40:06.991
I hate going.

40:07.060 --> 40:10.028
And it was like I went, I did
it all for her, but because I

40:10.097 --> 40:13.232
didn't enjoy it, I still get a
moaning at the end of the night,

40:13.300 --> 40:14.667
and it was a bit like that.

40:14.735 --> 40:17.036
I did all that for her.

40:17.105 --> 40:19.472
And it was pretty comfy.

40:19.541 --> 40:22.376
I mean, you know,
compared to the windsor.

40:22.444 --> 40:27.981
I tell you what, I could probably
get me head down in there.

40:43.731 --> 40:45.898
It's not funny, is it?

40:45.967 --> 40:47.533
What?

40:47.602 --> 40:50.623
Well, I've been living
next door to this.

40:53.741 --> 40:55.708
Did Ricky put me in
that one on purpose?

40:55.777 --> 40:58.144
Yeah.

41:03.950 --> 41:06.885
Yeah.

41:06.954 --> 41:09.655
This is the room
Michael Palin was in.

41:40.127 --> 41:44.605
I don't ***
but I don't think it does.

41:44.725 --> 41:47.644
