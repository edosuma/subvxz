WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:06.005
Guys,

00:06.486 --> 00:08.696
guess what I just heard in the ladies bathroom?

00:10.558 --> 00:14.372
- Fez, what were you doing in the ladies bathroom?
- Oh, spying, eating lunch, y'know.

00:16.187 --> 00:20.125
I heard two girls say they did not want to go to college as virgins.

00:21.085 --> 00:23.657
Yeah, I caught that wave last year.

00:25.420 --> 00:32.015
So I'm thinking if horny virgins are dying for sex,
then hunting horny virgins I will go.

00:34.961 --> 00:39.851
By the way Fez, it's not pronounced virgin;
it's pronounced vir-GIN.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.392
- I thought it was virgin?
- No, no Hyde's right it's vir-GIN.

00:46.064 --> 00:49.036
Oh now I will not sound stupid in front of the beautiful vir-GINS.

00:54.374 --> 00:56.559
Oh my God. That's - that's the girl,

00:56.559 --> 00:59.962
- that's the one I made it with at the Molly Hatchet concert.
- That's Brooke.

01:00.639 --> 01:02.592
Man, no one sleeps with that Brooke.

01:03.051 --> 01:09.065
When we were sophomores and she was a senior,
she turned down her science teacher, and he drove a Corvette.

01:09.065 --> 01:12.905
Yeah, she was like some sort of mythical creature, like a unicorn.

01:15.169 --> 01:16.648
It's weird, it seems like she's moving too fast.

01:17.592 --> 01:20.642
It's probably cause all my memories of her are in super jiggle sexy slo-mo.

01:22.830 --> 01:27.986
Well all I know is that's her, and I did it with her, and I'll prove it.

01:34.616 --> 01:35.621
Hey Brooke,

01:36.387 --> 01:40.993
now I know this is kinda awkward
but could you tell my friends over there...

01:44.872 --> 01:47.371
about you and me at the Molly Hatchet concert?

01:48.768 --> 01:50.393
Do I know you?

01:52.156 --> 01:53.931
Hey I'm sorry to interrupt but uh...

01:54.553 --> 01:56.067
Burn!

01:59.430 --> 02:03.116
No, it's me Michael from the concert.
Okay, I've been looking for you for weeks

02:03.571 --> 02:07.558
and I think you were so blissed out, and that does happen,
that you gave me the wrong phone number.

02:08.912 --> 02:11.134
But the good news is I wasn't a dream.

02:12.730 --> 02:14.842
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.

02:15.776 --> 02:20.954
No, Michael Kelso.
'Let's do it in the men's room, it's more romantic.'

02:22.052 --> 02:26.746
No, what...
I kicked that kid out of the handicapped stall so we could have more room!

02:31.514 --> 02:34.705

03:05.694 --> 03:07.422
What is Brooke's deal, man?

03:10.321 --> 03:13.583
I mean, most girls lie about doing it with me when they haven't.

03:14.927 --> 03:17.421
This... the... everything is backwards.

03:19.636 --> 03:23.508
Yeah, this is just like Freaky Friday, but unlike that charming little movie

03:24.413 --> 03:26.497
.. your story has no basis in fact.

03:29.226 --> 03:32.641
It does too, except it's just the girl is avoiding me.

03:33.246 --> 03:36.790
- I mean, how do you get a girl to come to you when you repulse her?
- Yeah, Eric?

03:42.125 --> 03:46.388
Well,
I like to put a hot dog on the end of a stick, and hide in the bushes so...

03:48.053 --> 03:52.034
Donna, so how do you know Brooke anyway?
Did you guys jump out of a cake together or something?

03:53.347 --> 03:54.993
Yeah!

03:56.671 --> 03:59.866
No moron.
When she was a senior we worked on the school paper together.

04:00.070 --> 04:04.436
I think you know Brooke cause there's a secret club in this town,
made up of all the hot girls.

04:05.629 --> 04:08.151
It's a secret hot girls club.

04:10.051 --> 04:13.266
There's no secret hot girls club,
believe me I'd know.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.951
Uh huh, well I'm gonna take off.
I have to get to my secret hot girls meeting...

04:23.754 --> 04:26.712
Why doesn't Brooke like me? I am a gentleman.

04:27.033 --> 04:31.237
Oh yeah, you lied about doing it with a hot girl in the men's room:
you're Cary Grant.

04:33.616 --> 04:36.178
Steven, you've been quiet.
Do you think Brooke's hot?

04:37.012 --> 04:38.449
Do you really want me to answer that question?

04:40.500 --> 04:42.053
Oh I think we all do.

04:44.592 --> 04:46.808
Steven, it's no big deal.
Do you think she's hot?

04:48.040 --> 04:50.496
Oh well, I guess since you're not setting a trap, I can answer honestly.

04:53.258 --> 04:57.090
- Yeah, she's freakin hot.
- Ah ha! See, I trapped ya.

04:59.479 --> 05:01.072
Now take it back or I'll pinch you.

05:02.896 --> 05:06.300
Jackie, if you pinch me, it's gonna cause a serious problem in this relationship.

05:07.354 --> 05:08.176
Fine

05:17.018 --> 05:20.956
Oh hey Jackie.
Are any of your college bound friends vir-GINS?

05:23.858 --> 05:25.425
It's pronounced virgins, Fez.

05:26.361 --> 05:27.520
What? But no, but Hyde said...

05:33.656 --> 05:35.312
Oh you magnificent bastard.

05:37.226 --> 05:40.757
Sorry buddy.
By the way it's pronounced bas-TARD

05:43.217 --> 05:48.443
Fez, if you wanna find virgins, go where ugly girls pray to get pretty
- the local House of Worship.

05:49.027 --> 05:50.615
House of Worship?

05:51.595 --> 05:53.777
Are you sure you don't mean the House of Pies?

05:56.283 --> 05:58.347
No Fez, I mean the House of Worship.

06:00.039 --> 06:01.705
I'm going to the House of Pies.

06:04.872 --> 06:07.679
So, how's it going at Point Place Junior College?

06:08.671 --> 06:13.263
Well the education's not too great,
but the upside is it's next to the Dairy Queen.

06:14.454 --> 06:17.549
First day of class we all got free Peanut Buster Parfaits.

06:25.062 --> 06:26.046
Hey guys.

06:27.306 --> 06:30.224
- Kelso, what are you doing?!
- I'm looking for Brooke's phone number.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.718
I mean why won't she admit that we did it?

06:33.789 --> 06:38.006
Kelso, there are racehorses, and there are donkeys.

06:39.627 --> 06:41.728
And you are a great donkey, you are like top donkey.

06:44.024 --> 06:46.404
But she's a racehorse, and guess what?

06:47.852 --> 06:49.310
She don't want no donkey.

06:51.359 --> 06:52.295
She might.

06:53.947 --> 06:58.621
Look, we had a great time together, and not just cause of the sex part,
but because we had a really great time.

07:00.349 --> 07:01.897
Donna, please help me find her.

07:02.598 --> 07:04.355
Okay, I'll give you a hint about where she works.

07:05.632 --> 07:06.738
It's in a quiet building,

07:07.950 --> 07:13.165
you could try and check her out on a date,
but she's probably booked for the future.

07:15.454 --> 07:17.385
She's a travel agent?

07:19.632 --> 07:23.805
She translated her love of books into a career.

07:25.081 --> 07:27.152
She's a translator.

07:28.058 --> 07:30.127
"Trabaja en la biblioteca", Kelso.

07:30.935 --> 07:32.649
She's the translator, not me Donna.

07:34.183 --> 07:35.661
Y'know, enough with these brain teasers.

07:37.793 --> 07:41.560
You tell me where Brooke works, and I'll return your underpants to safety.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.978
Kelso, aren't you a little old to be stealing Donna's undies?

07:47.770 --> 07:49.280
A collector never stops collecting, Eric.

07:54.376 --> 07:56.916
The library, Kelso, she works in the library.

07:57.525 --> 07:59.748
Now will you put my underwear back you perv?

08:01.503 --> 08:02.264
I lied.

08:05.495 --> 08:09.294
Ooo wow, those male actors are gorgeous.

08:11.381 --> 08:16.328
Y'know I think that Robert Redford is so hot.
He's hotter than the sun.

08:19.984 --> 08:21.248
He's extremely handsome.

08:23.455 --> 08:25.293
You know who I think is sexy?

08:28.193 --> 08:30.185
James Caan in the Godfather.

08:32.357 --> 08:38.275
Now, if he made me an offer, I sure couldn't refuse.
Yowsa!

08:41.424 --> 08:42.376
Do you mind?

08:42.852 --> 08:47.114
I'm sorry; I thought we were having a conversation.

08:49.533 --> 08:55.030
Y'know what Steven, I actually think that every guy on TV,
and in life is hotter than you.

08:57.731 --> 09:02.055
Jackie, I know what you're doing, okay?
I said Brooke was hot, and now you're totally insecure.

09:02.356 --> 09:04.749
Oh I am not insecure, okay?

09:05.303 --> 09:12.044
This is a designer sweater, this is designer eye shadow,
and those are designer shoes, and they make me feel incredibly secure.

09:15.106 --> 09:16.161
You know who else I like?

09:18.084 --> 09:19.800
That little fella who plays Colombo.

09:22.770 --> 09:23.834
I just wanna give him a bath.

09:29.636 --> 09:32.375
Steven, why can't you just say that Brooke's not hot?

09:32.670 --> 09:34.546
It's common relationship courtesy.

09:34.546 --> 09:38.933
If you can't do this, what will you do when I'm old,
and ask you if I have crow's feet around my eyes?

09:39.558 --> 09:40.665
By the way, that's already starting.

09:48.016 --> 09:50.145
You've never been in a relationship, have you son?

09:52.400 --> 09:54.913
What, when she asked if Brooke was hot,
I should have lied and said no?

09:56.369 --> 09:59.264
Being honest and screwing yourself is clearly the better plan.

10:01.439 --> 10:04.116
Sweetie, white lies help relationships.

10:04.503 --> 10:10.610
Like, 'Kitty, even though your pot roast was overdone,
I still loved it.'

10:12.296 --> 10:16.241
Oh for the love of God, I did love it.

10:18.046 --> 10:20.001
You're a pot roast genius, okay?

10:21.326 --> 10:22.950
It was like eating gold.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.850
- So you're saying lying is good?
- Exactly.

10:29.090 --> 10:31.977
Now go do the right thing,
and lie to the woman you love!

10:34.212 --> 10:36.708
- Red, this is crazy right?
- Yeah, they're all nuts.

10:40.791 --> 10:42.349
Except you, sweetheart.

10:49.810 --> 10:51.487
Look at all the smart, lonely girls.

10:53.614 --> 10:56.402
Little ones, big ones;
it's like a virgin pumpkin patch.

11:08.060 --> 11:11.371
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'd like an order of books please.

11:13.707 --> 11:17.050
- Could you be more specific?
- Could you be more beautiful?

11:18.087 --> 11:19.494
Could you be more lame?

11:20.764 --> 11:21.545
Yes

11:24.093 --> 11:27.049
- Excuse me, I'm trying to read.
- Don't be a sissy.

11:28.755 --> 11:33.536
- Y'know what? Here's a firecracker, go live a little.
- Thanks

11:35.194 --> 11:38.627
Look, I know why you're here and I'm sorry, you're not my type.

11:39.692 --> 11:42.724
I was high school valedictorian
and you're the antithesis of that.

11:43.517 --> 11:44.495
The anti-who-of-what?

11:47.017 --> 11:47.719
Exactly.

11:48.460 --> 11:55.230
Okay no, come on don't be like that okay? Look I really like you and I
just thought that maybe we could go out some time,

11:55.877 --> 11:57.196
like for coffee.

11:57.956 --> 12:00.132
and then if that went good, then we could go to a movie.

12:01.175 --> 12:05.529
and then when we really start to trust each other,
you can tell my friends how we did it at the Molly Hatchet concert.

12:07.481 --> 12:09.409
Look, I don't make it with guys at concerts.

12:10.065 --> 12:13.908
I read two periodicals a week about the Dewey Decimal system,
which I'm sure you've never heard of.

12:14.587 --> 12:15.943
Okay I have heard of Dewey Decimal...

12:17.572 --> 12:18.760
it's Donald Ducks nephew.

12:25.825 --> 12:30.217
I can't believe Brooke.
I mean standing there at the library, totally resisting me.

12:31.002 --> 12:32.347
I can't believe we have a library.

12:34.758 --> 12:36.535
I know, what is it like invisible?

12:38.510 --> 12:40.934
No, no, you know that parking lot where we drink beer in?

12:42.964 --> 12:45.010
Okay, well you know that wall that we lean up against?

12:46.524 --> 12:47.663
That's the library.

12:50.653 --> 12:53.091
Well then, guess who has peed on the library?

12:56.640 --> 13:01.792
Y'know for the first time in my life,
I hope there's not a secret hot girls club, because if there is,

13:01.887 --> 13:04.725
I bet Brooke said awful things about me at their last meeting.

13:13.306 --> 13:14.347
Order bitches.

13:16.858 --> 13:18.879
The secret hot girls club is now in session.

13:19.723 --> 13:22.254
Now, last meeting we all decided to go braless,

13:22.791 --> 13:27.034
and I just wanna report that operation bazooma
bounce is driving the boys insane.

13:30.707 --> 13:33.627
Hi, my name is Brooke and I've been a hot girl for 6 years.

13:35.057 --> 13:36.150
Hi Brooke.

13:36.826 --> 13:42.267
And I just wanna let everyone know that Michael Kelso asked me out,
and I resisted his charms and turned him down.

13:44.530 --> 13:48.274
- But he's irresistible.
- That's what I thought, but it's a lie, a lie I tell you.

13:50.257 --> 13:55.803
Then it's official.
No secret hot girl will ever date Michael Kelso ever again.

13:57.723 --> 13:59.143
Okay that's great, that's great.

13:59.333 --> 14:02.060
Now this calls for dancing bubble kiss time!

14:17.796 --> 14:21.688
Kelso, there is no secret hot girls club.

14:23.107 --> 14:25.503
Well of course the president won't admit it.

14:28.717 --> 14:34.556
Y'know I don't care is there's a club or not,
dancing bubble kiss time is just a fabulous idea.

14:36.071 --> 14:40.065
Well all I know is that Brooke and I
had a romantic night together at the concert.

14:41.492 --> 14:43.348
Why is she pretending like it didn't happen?

14:43.627 --> 14:47.629
Well maybe she's embarrassed.
I mean she's used to dating really brainy guys.

14:48.085 --> 14:51.897
Yeah, not guys who set their own pants on fire.

14:52.839 --> 14:55.044
On a dare.

14:55.348 --> 14:56.742
And I won a dollar.

14:58.302 --> 15:02.628
Kelso, if you want Brooke to like you, y'know maybe you should go down
to the library and show her you can be smart.

15:03.238 --> 15:04.753
I hate the library.

15:06.504 --> 15:08.504
The only good thing about it is that you can check out Playboys.

15:09.497 --> 15:10.935
I mean they have every issue since it started.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.805
Wait, every issue?

15:15.755 --> 15:21.962
Are you telling me that they have the one with Pamela Sue Martin,
televisions Nancy Drew, in a grotto, straddling the world's luckiest boulder?

15:26.955 --> 15:29.208
Uh, they have periodicals you say?

15:34.280 --> 15:37.349
What is wrong with Steven?
I mean why won't he just say that Brooke's not hot?

15:37.962 --> 15:39.252
Because he doesn't know how to lie.

15:41.111 --> 15:44.189
He's an orphan;
he never had a mother to teach him how.

15:46.410 --> 15:48.234
I mean, how do I know he loves me if he doesn't obey me?

15:51.114 --> 15:56.028
Well, you've chosen a strong man,
Jackie and they don't always obey.

15:56.128 --> 16:01.095
Now, do I think he should have said that other girl wasn't pretty,
yes, but you have to pick your battles.

16:01.662 --> 16:03.834
Wait, no, I wanna be right all the time.

16:06.078 --> 16:09.491
And you will be.
After a few years they just...

16:10.220 --> 16:11.015
they give up.

16:13.197 --> 16:13.950
Okay, watch.

16:15.908 --> 16:19.234
Red, could you go to the drug store
and get me a Ladies Home Journal?

16:21.122 --> 16:22.562
But I just...

16:24.273 --> 16:25.902
It's all frosty.

16:28.243 --> 16:29.596
Aw Crap!

16:34.190 --> 16:35.220
Jackpot my friend.

16:38.683 --> 16:43.736
Not only did I get Nancy Drew, but I also got Margot Kidder,
Superman's Lois Lane, in an outfit that,

16:44.649 --> 16:46.890
let's just say you don't need x-ray vision to appreciate.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.299
Well get those outta here,
man I'm trying to impress Brooke with my intelligence.

16:53.294 --> 16:53.997
Here she comes.

16:54.817 --> 16:59.680
Say Eric, this encyclopaedia of scientific terms
has really taught me something.

17:01.308 --> 17:06.470
See by lifting this encyclopaedia
of scientific terms above my head,

17:07.244 --> 17:08.667
I'm using my body's stored energy,

17:10.914 --> 17:12.855
also known as uranium.

17:16.150 --> 17:17.717
Um, actually it's known as calories,

17:18.901 --> 17:21.571
but I do believe at some point you were exposed to radiation.

17:24.338 --> 17:29.201
Alright look, I don't know what you have against me,
but I'm not leaving here until I convince you to go out with me.

17:30.072 --> 17:32.137
That's the man who gave me the firecrackers, Mom.

17:33.930 --> 17:34.760
I gotta run.

17:37.639 --> 17:38.604
You wanna check something out?

17:43.082 --> 17:48.287
No, um is there someone else who can help me?
Like a man.

17:51.216 --> 17:53.825
So you wanna check out those Playboys, or not?

17:55.079 --> 18:00.619
Okay, fine.
I'm a man, I would like these Playboys.

18:01.321 --> 18:02.833
Well, you can't have them.

18:04.978 --> 18:11.346
I want you to get in your car, buy some flowers, give them to Donna,
and thank God an actual live woman lets you touch her.

18:12.824 --> 18:13.350
Yes ma'am.

18:16.385 --> 18:20.702
Okay Steven, I think I figured out a way to end
this situation where everybody wins.

18:21.087 --> 18:22.840
Now, listen to this question carefully.

18:23.586 --> 18:29.802
Is there anyone you said was hot - like Brooke,
who you really don't think is hot - like Brooke?

18:31.692 --> 18:33.027
Well I could lie and say yes.

18:33.132 --> 18:36.380
Then do it. I don't care of you don't mean it;
it's the words that count.

18:39.412 --> 18:40.730
Jackie, I'm not gonna lie.

18:41.315 --> 18:43.660
Fine.
Then y'know what, I don't know how to fix this.

18:49.448 --> 18:51.679
'pick you battles.'

18:53.794 --> 18:54.333
Fine.

18:55.333 --> 18:58.852
Steven, I don't care if you think she's hot,
because that's how you really feel.

18:59.743 --> 19:00.484
Thank you.

19:03.928 --> 19:07.532
Hey Steven, will you go to the drug store
and get me a Vogue magazine?

19:09.799 --> 19:10.484
But I just...

19:11.368 --> 19:12.264
It's gonna melt.

19:15.818 --> 19:16.447
Crap!

19:24.750 --> 19:27.516
Well, my plan to have sex with virgins failed,

19:30.601 --> 19:34.162
so I've widened my search from virgins to everyone.

19:36.415 --> 19:38.410
So, basically you're back to where you started this morning.

19:40.239 --> 19:41.497
Not really, I had some pie.

19:43.790 --> 19:44.659
I've done less in a day.

19:48.388 --> 19:52.771
Well Donna, turns out Brooke doesn't like intelligent men.

19:54.782 --> 19:58.147
Kelso, you didn't have sex with her man, just let it go.

20:00.570 --> 20:01.900
Michael, I need to talk to you.

20:03.346 --> 20:05.195
Yeah, about what?

20:08.145 --> 20:10.763
About our night together at the Molly Hatchet concert.

20:16.563 --> 20:17.321
Excuse me.

20:18.509 --> 20:19.456
Burn!

20:21.077 --> 20:21.366
Burn!

20:22.338 --> 20:23.242
Burn, Burn!

20:27.933 --> 20:29.747
Burn...Burn!

20:36.144 --> 20:37.174
Burn...

20:39.907 --> 20:41.660
We totally did it!

20:43.835 --> 20:46.047
Michael, I just found out I'm pregnant.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.648
I never touched her.

21:09.397 --> 21:10.990
Psst kid, hey you see this?

21:11.457 --> 21:17.058
That's a Playboy.And inside are things beyond
your wildest dreams, magical glorious things.

21:18.120 --> 21:22.622
So if you toss it in your book, and you check it out for me,
I'll let you have a look see, what do ya say?

21:22.759 --> 21:25.466
You're pathetic, just go buy a Playboy, you loser.

21:27.015 --> 21:29.435
Loser? Hey I'm not the one reading Hardy Boys.

21:29.918 --> 21:34.200
For your information the stolen money
was hidden in the grandfather clock! Who's the loser now?

21:35.305 --> 21:41.398
