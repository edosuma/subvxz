40:39.728 --> 40:42.270
AND YOUR BRAIN
MIGHT NEVER BE THE SAME.

40:42.270 --> 40:44.483
BUT DOES THAT MEAN

40:44.483 --> 40:48.196
THAT WE SHOULD
LIVE IN PROTECTIVE COCOONS,

40:48.196 --> 40:52.200
NEVER EXPOSING OURSELVES
TO POTENTIAL HURT,

40:52.200 --> 40:55.163
PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL?

40:58.246 --> 41:01.459
OR IS THE REAL ART OF LIVING...

41:01.459 --> 41:03.461
TO OVERCOME OUR WOUNDS...

41:03.461 --> 41:05.383
[ BACH'S "JESU JOY
OF MAN'S DESIRING" PLAYS ]

41:07.506 --> 41:10.719
...MAKE THE BEST
OF OUR LIMITATIONS...

41:19.808 --> 41:23.021
...AND EMBRACE OUR GIFTS?
