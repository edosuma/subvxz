WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:07.141
( theme music playing )

00:18.619 --> 00:20.654
FINALLY.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.758
THANK YOU.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.427
YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.801
- NO GOOD?
- LARRY!

00:33.901 --> 00:36.604
IT TASTES LIKE YOU PUT
THE WHOLE SALT SHAKER
UP IN HERE.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.473
NO, THAT'S WAY TOO SALTY.
WAY TOO SALTY.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.742
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S TOO SALTY.
I'M SORRY.

00:41.842 --> 00:45.246
PFFT, COULD YOU MAKE IT
ANY HOTTER IN HERE,
BY THE WAY?

00:45.346 --> 00:48.282
- IT FEELS GOOD.
- IT FEELS GOOD?

00:48.382 --> 00:50.318
YEAH, IT FEELS GOOD.
75Â° IS PERFECT.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.086
I CAN'T EVEN SLEEP
IN THIS ROOM AT NIGHT,
IT'S SO HOT.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.522
- HONEST TO GOD.
- WHAT TEMPERATURE
WOULD YOU PREFER?

00:54.622 --> 00:56.590
- 68Â°.
- 68Â°?!

00:56.690 --> 00:59.393
SEE, THAT'S SOME
WHITE-PEOPLE SHIT
RIGHT THERE, L.D.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.563
BLACK PEOPLE LIKE IT
A LITTLE BIT WARMER
AT NIGHT, OKAY?

01:02.663 --> 01:05.199
- AT LEAST COMPROMISE.
- NO NO NO, 75Â° WORKS
FOR ME, L.D.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.268
I'LL CALL LEON.
LET'S SEE WHAT HE SAYS. LEON!

01:07.368 --> 01:10.404
- LEON, COME IN HERE!
- HE GONNA LET YOU KNOW THAT
THAT'S HOW WE LIKE IT.

01:10.504 --> 01:13.274
OKAY, YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T SLEEP.
IT'S TOO HOT AT NIGHT.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.776
I WANT TO SLEEP
IN 68Â° TEMPERATURE.

01:15.876 --> 01:19.147
SHE WANTS TO SLEEP IN 75Â°.
LET'S COMPROMISE AT 72Â°.

01:19.247 --> 01:22.750
OH NO, FUCK THAT, LARRY.
YOU MY MOTHERFUCKING MAN,
LARRY, BUT 72Â°? SHIT.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.486
YOU MIGHT AS WELL SLEEP OUTSIDE.
I'M AN 82Â° MAN MYSELF.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.656
- SEE THERE, I TOLD YOU!
- 82Â°, THAT'S MY SHIT.
THAT'S MY FUCKING REGION.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.459
- YOU REALLY WANTED IT 68Â°.
- 6-FUCKING-8? HE SAID 68Â°?

01:31.559 --> 01:34.162
- GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.
- IT'S LIKE A FRIGERATOR.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.796
- OH MY GOODNESS.
- YOU TAKE THAT SHIT?

01:35.896 --> 01:38.065
- YOU BRING A HONEY
TO THE HOTEL AND SHIT...
- RIGHT!

01:38.166 --> 01:41.068
...GET UP IN THAT MOTHERFUCKER.
IT'S ALL COLD AND SHIT--
GOT TO HEAT HER ASS UP.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.903
( complaining continues )

01:43.003 --> 01:46.106
ALL RIGHT NOW, YOU MAKE SURE
YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE
YOU WATCH THAT TV.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.941
- HEY, HI!
- HEY, LARRY.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.544
- WHAT'S UP?
- HEY, I GOT SOME SHOWS TIVO'D.
DON'T ERASE THEM.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.547
THEY ERASE
ALL MY TIVO'D SHOWS.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.950
YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY?
THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER ROBBERY
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:57.050 --> 02:00.120
I WAS JUST TALKING
TO THE NEIGHBORS.
IT'S THE THIRD ONE THIS MONTH.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.790
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
TO THE NEIGHBORS FOR?

02:02.890 --> 02:05.193
THEY CAME OVER AND LET ME
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.060
YOU DON'T NEED TO TALK
TO THE NEIGHBORS, OKAY?

02:07.161 --> 02:08.929
YEAH, BUT, LARRY,
THERE'S BEEN A ROBBERY.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.899
I'D RATHER HAVE THE THIEVES
THAN THE NEIGHBORS--
THIEVES DON'T IMPOSE.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.402
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- THE NEIGHBORS WANT YOUR TIME.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.271
THE THIEVES WANT YOUR THINGS.
I'D RATHER GIVE THEM
THINGS THAN TIME.

02:17.371 --> 02:20.241
LISTEN, HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYTHING FROM THE DOCTOR
ABOUT LORETTA'S BIOPSY?

02:20.341 --> 02:22.876
NO NO, THEY SAID
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.979
OH. YOU KNOW,
AT FIRST I WAS
REALLY WORRIED, LARRY.

02:26.079 --> 02:30.218
BUT NO MATTER
WHAT THE OUTCOME IS,
LORETTA HAS YOU BY HER SIDE.

02:30.318 --> 02:34.488
YOU KNOW, THINGS COULD
GET BAD, LARRY, BUT SHE'S
GOT YOU TO HOLD HER HAND.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.825
AND IF SHE HAS TO DO CHEMO
AND IT CAUSES HER
TO LOSE HER HAIR,

02:37.925 --> 02:41.562
THROW UP AND ALL THAT,
YOU GONNA BE RIGHT THERE
BY HER SIDE.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.531
THANK YOU, LARRY.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.336
Larry:
75Â°? I'M BAKING
IN THAT ROOM AT NIGHT.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.838
IT'S LIKE I'M CINDERELLA
IN THERE, I SWEAR TO YOU.

02:50.938 --> 02:55.042
- CINDERELLA? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- CINDERELLA, YOU NEVER SAW
THE FAIRY TALE CINDERELLA?

02:55.142 --> 02:57.645
NO NO, I KNOW CINDERELLA.
BUT WHAT ASPECT OF CINDERELLA?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:57.745 --> 03:01.215
- WHAT ASPECT
DO YOU THINK I MEAN?
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.751
- THE SHOE?
- SHE GETS BOSSED AROUND
BY THE STEPMOTHER!

03:03.851 --> 03:07.288
OH, THE EVIL STEPMOTHER.
SO YOU'RE COMPARING HER
TO AN EVIL STEPMOTHER?

03:07.388 --> 03:09.122
- I'M COMPARING ME--
- DON'T GET MAD AT ME!

03:09.223 --> 03:10.758
- WELL, YOU'RE SO STUPID!
- DON'T GET MAD AT ME.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.193
SO THAT'S
WHAT IT'S LIKE, HUH?
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.595
THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE.
EXACTLY.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.530
- THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE.
- OH, THAT'S HORRIBLE.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.732
- YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW
WHAT THE WORST PART IS?
- WHAT?

03:18.832 --> 03:20.901
WE'RE WAITING
FOR THE RESULTS
OF THIS BIOPSY NOW.

03:21.001 --> 03:24.305
I GOT ABOUT 24 HOURS
TO GET OUT OF THIS THING
BEFORE THE RESULTS COME BACK.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.274
YEAH, YOU CAN'T BREAK UP
WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT CANCER.

03:26.374 --> 03:29.377
YOU GOTTA BREAK UP
WITH HER BEFORE SHE GETS
THOSE TEST RESULTS.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.745
( sighs )
GOD, IT'S GONNA BE SO HARD.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.482
- WHY? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WHAT'S
THE BIG DEAL?"

03:34.582 --> 03:36.484
THE WHOLE FAMILY'S GOTTA
MOVE OUT-- IT'S A BIG DEAL!

03:36.584 --> 03:39.253
I'D MUCH RATHER BE
IN HER POSITION THAN MINE
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.322
NO, TO BE THE BREAKER-UPPER
YOU'RE IN CONTROL.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.991
COUPLES SHOULD HAVE LIKE
A PRE-BREAKUP AGREEMENT

03:44.091 --> 03:47.495
BEFORE THEY START GOING OUT
BECAUSE EVERY RELATIONSHIP IS
GOING TO END AT SOME POINT.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.530
ALL YOU DO IS SEND A TEXT.
YOU MAKE AN AGREEMENT--

03:49.630 --> 03:51.799
"IF YOU SEE THE WORD 'APRICOT,'
IT MEANS IT'S OVER."

03:51.899 --> 03:55.736
OKAY, HYPOTHETICALLY,
WHAT IF YOU OR SHE ARE
EATING APRICOTS AT THAT POINT?

03:55.836 --> 03:58.105
- CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT APRICOTS?
- WHAT WHAT?

03:58.205 --> 04:00.741
YOU KNOW, ONE IN 30
IS A GOOD ONE.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.143
- OKAY.
- IT'S SUCH
A LOW-PERCENTAGE FRUIT.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.945
- OKAY.
- ALWAYS A MEALY DRY--

04:05.045 --> 04:06.380
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
- HEY.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.382
- HI, LAR.
- OH, HEY.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.784
- HEY.
- WANT TO COME TO
A DINNER PARTY TONIGHT?

04:10.884 --> 04:12.553
- TONIGHT?
- YEAH.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.788
- OH.
- YOU KNOW YOU LOVE
MY COOKING.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.291
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR AN INVITATION,
IS IT NOT?

04:17.391 --> 04:19.660
WELL... IT'S AN INVITATION
NONETHELESS.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.630
- WHO ELSE IS GONNA BE THERE?
- UH, EH, YOU DON'T
NEED TO KNOW.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.799
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE IT'S NOT DONE,
THAT'S WHY NOT.

04:25.899 --> 04:29.002
- WHAT DO YOU
MEAN IT'S NOT DONE?
- IT'S A SOCIAL CONVENTION

04:29.102 --> 04:32.506
THAT PEOPLE DON'T ASK
WHO'S GOING TO BE THERE
AT THE DINNER PARTY.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.875
- IT'S JUST NOT DONE.
- BIG DEAL. WHY ISN'T IT DONE?

04:34.975 --> 04:38.078
BECAUSE IT ISN'T!
I DON'T KNOW THE DERIVATION
OF THE CONVENTION.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.113
WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING IT
BLINDLY LIKE THIS?

04:40.213 --> 04:41.949
YOU SHOULD BE GLAD
THAT IT HAPPENS THAT WAY,

04:42.049 --> 04:44.151
BECAUSE IF I TOLD
PEOPLE YOU WERE COMING,
THEY MIGHT NOT SHOW UP.

04:44.251 --> 04:47.220
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
PEOPLE DON'T TELL-- BECAUSE IF
IT GETS OUT WHO'S COMING

04:47.321 --> 04:49.923
NOBODY WOULD WANT TO GO.
SO WHY EVEN HAVE IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE

04:50.023 --> 04:51.759
IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE
WITH EACH OTHER?

04:51.859 --> 04:55.128
I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHY.
IT'S JUST NOT DONE.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.864
WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE
OF TELLING ME?

04:56.964 --> 04:59.633
I DON'T KNOW THAT
THERE IS A DOWNSIDE,
EXCEPT THAT--

04:59.733 --> 05:01.502
- YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW.
- WHO'S COMING?

05:01.602 --> 05:03.404
- DON'T YOU DARE TELL HIM.
- WHAT'S THAT?

05:03.504 --> 05:05.005
- WHO'S COMING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

05:05.105 --> 05:08.376
WHY DO YOU EVEN GET STARTED
WITH HER ON THIS STUFF?

05:08.476 --> 05:10.310
- THAT'S MY QUESTION.
- WHAT TIME?

05:10.411 --> 05:12.112
- 7:30.
- YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.448
- YOU'D BETTER GO DO IT.
- NOT NOW, MAYBE TONIGHT.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.350
- ALL RIGHT.
- THANK YOU.
SEE YOU LATER.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.252
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YA!

05:19.353 --> 05:22.089
- YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, ALL RIGHT?
- THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.958
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- WE STILL DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.160
OH.
HI.

05:27.260 --> 05:31.298
OH SHOOT!
I FORGOT-- I GOTTA
FEED THOSE FISH AGAIN.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.734
IT'S LIKE A HUGE
RESPONSIBILITY--
FEEDING FISH.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.903
IT'S NOT FUN.
THINK ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

05:36.003 --> 05:38.338
I'M OUTSIDE, I GOTTA
GO HOME AND FEED FISH?

05:38.439 --> 05:40.674
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
WHO GIVES A SHIT?

05:40.774 --> 05:44.344
MR. DAVID, I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.213
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
NOT PETS, REALLY.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.716
BUT YET IT'S THE SAME
RESPONSIBILITY AS A PET,

05:48.816 --> 05:50.718
BUT YOU GET NOTHING BACK.
YOU WATCH THEM,

05:50.818 --> 05:52.920
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE FASCINATING?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.688
I DON'T KNOW.
UM...

05:54.788 --> 05:57.591
- CAN I TALK
TO YOU ABOUT LORETTA?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.860
- WELL--
- DO YOU THINK SHE HAS--

05:59.960 --> 06:02.796
THINK SHE HAS CANCER?

06:02.896 --> 06:05.466
I-- I CAN'T SPECULATE
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.935
WE DID A BIOPSY
AT THE HOSPITAL AND--

06:08.035 --> 06:13.173
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:
SAY YOU HAD TO MAKE A BET
WITH VEGAS ON THIS,

06:13.273 --> 06:16.944
WOULD YOU BET FOR CANCER
OR AGAINST CANCER?

06:17.044 --> 06:19.513
I-- I-- I DON'T GET
INTO THAT NUMBERS GAME.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.583
- YOU MUST HAVE AN IDEA.
- I DON'T.

06:22.683 --> 06:23.951
- NO IDEA?
- NO IDEA.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.587
WHAT IS THIS THING?
I'VE HAD THIS AWHILE.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.222
- WHAT IS THAT?
- IT'S JUST A SKIN TAG.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.891
JUST PUT A LITTLE LOTION
ON THERE.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.893
BUT-- HOLD ON A SEC.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.063
I'M GONNA WRITE YOU A FEW
PRESCRIPTIONS TO FILL OUT.

06:42.636 --> 06:46.373
I'M GONNA PRESCRIBE ZITHROMAX
AND TYLENOL WITH CODEINE.

06:46.474 --> 06:49.342
NOW THE TYLENOL,
THAT'S JUST AS NEEDED
FOR PAIN.

06:49.443 --> 06:52.946
AGAIN, IN A FEW DAYS--
ANY DAY,

06:53.046 --> 06:55.816
WE'LL HAVE THE BIOPSY BACK
AND THAT WILL

06:55.916 --> 06:58.418
HELP US DETERMINE
WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.821
BUT RIGHT NOW, I WANT YOU
TO JUST STAY CALM,

07:00.921 --> 07:03.323
AND-- WHAT'S WRONG?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.258
( snorts )
YOU JUST

07:05.358 --> 07:08.929
GO INTO THE REFRIGERATOR
WITHOUT ASKING?

07:09.029 --> 07:11.298
I JUST GOT MYSELF
A LEMONADE.
IS THAT A--

07:11.398 --> 07:13.701
I WAS JUST SURPRISED
YOU DIDN'T ASK.

07:13.801 --> 07:17.104
- I'M SURPRISED YOU
DIDN'T OFFER, TO BE HONEST.
- WELL, I WAS ABOUT TO OFFER.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.973
- I DON'T THINK
YOU WERE ABOUT TO OFFER...
- WELL, I WAS GONNA OFFER--

07:20.073 --> 07:22.710
- ...IF YOU HADN'T
OFFERED ME BY NOW.
- IT IS A LITTLE UNUSUAL

07:22.810 --> 07:25.579
TO GO INTO
SOMEONE'S REFRIGERATOR
WITHOUT ASKING, IS IT NOT?

07:25.679 --> 07:29.216
I CAN TELL WHEN SOMEBODY'S GONNA
OFFER ME LEMONADE. YOU WERE NOT
GOING TO OFFER ME LEMONADE.

07:29.316 --> 07:32.052
IF ANYTHING, YOU WERE GOING
TO COMPLAIN TO ME ABOUT BEING
A FISH OWNER OR SOMETHING.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.888
- IT IS DIFFICULT
TO BE A FISH OWNER.
- WHY IS THAT A PRIORITY?!

07:34.988 --> 07:37.658
- YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS SICK.
- I DIDN'T SAY IT'S A PRIORITY.

07:37.758 --> 07:41.161
I JUST SAID THAT THEY NEED
TO BE FED AND IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO THINK ABOUT.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.696
YOU DO NOT NEED
TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.965
WHAT YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT
IS THE SICK WOMAN UPSTAIRS.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.134
I'M THINKING ABOUT THAT.
AND BY THE WAY,
WHY COULDN'T YOU ASK?

07:47.234 --> 07:49.069
- WHY COULDN'T--
- ARE YOU SO DAINTY
YOU CAN'T SAY

07:49.169 --> 07:51.805
- "MAY I PLEASE HAVE
A GLASS OF WATER?"
- I AM NOT DAINTY!

07:51.905 --> 07:54.474
"MAY I HAVE A PIECE OF PIE?"
IT COULD BE TUNA FISH--
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.709
- YOU KNOW.
- NO, IT DOES MATTER.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.878
HERE, YOU WANT?
TAKE-- TAKE THIS.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.614
- YOU DON'T OFFER-- A HOT DAY--
A MOVER COMES HERE...
- YOU WANT THIS?

08:00.714 --> 08:03.684
- ...YOU SAY,
"YOU WANT SOME TUNA FISH?"
- YOU WANT THIS LITTLE PEAR?

08:03.784 --> 08:05.619
DON'T CONDESCEND TO ME
WITH YOUR TINY PEAR.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.088
I'M NOT THE ONE
THAT HAS A PROBLEM HERE.
YOU ARE, MY FRIEND.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.223
- YOU ARE.
- YEAH.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.625
- OKAY, FINE.
- YEAH, FINE.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.561
- HEY, DR. SCHAFFER.
- HELLO.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.696
DID YOU SEE THAT?
DID YOU SEE THAT GUY?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.798
- WHAT WAS THAT WHOLE THING?
- HE GOES IN MY REFRIGERATOR.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.432
- COME ON, YOU DON'T DO THAT.
- WHAT DID HE TAKE?

08:19.533 --> 08:21.769
- LEMONADE.
- LIQUIDS ARE OKAY.

08:21.869 --> 08:25.072
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE
SHOULD GO INTO MY REFRIGERATOR.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.440
- WHAT KIND OF
A STUPID RULE THIS THAT?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:27.541 --> 08:29.309
I DON'T GO INTO OTHER
PEOPLE'S REFRIGERATORS.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.944
YOU COULD GO
INTO MY REFRIGERATOR.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.581
- I DON'T GO
INTO YOUR REFRIGERATOR.
- YOU'RE A WELCOME GUEST.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.248
HEY, HOW'S YOUR SISTER,
BY THE WAY?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.917
- BAM BAM?
- YEAH.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.019
- THANKS FOR ASKING.
SHE'S DOING A LOT BETTER.
- REALLY?

08:39.119 --> 08:42.255
YEAH. I'M REALLY GLAD
WE TOOK HER OUT OF THAT
MENTAL INSTITUTION.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.657
- THAT'S GOOD.
- YEAH, I'M EXCITED.

08:43.757 --> 08:46.459
YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO--

08:46.560 --> 08:48.796
YOU LET ME KNOW.

08:48.896 --> 08:52.299
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.434
- WHAT?
- YEAH, YOU CAN COME OVER

08:54.534 --> 08:57.204
TODAY AT 1:00
AND VISIT WITH HER.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.607
- VISIT HER?
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?
- YEAH.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.209
- WHY, YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT?
- OF COURSE NOT!

09:02.309 --> 09:03.877
WHY DID YOU SAY IT THEN?

09:03.977 --> 09:06.079
YOU KNOW, IT WAS SOME--
AN EMPTY GESTURE.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.248
- IT WAS SOMETHING TO SAY.
- GUESS WHAT.

09:08.348 --> 09:11.318
YOU SAID IT.
BE THERE AT 1:00.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.854
BUT ONE THING-- WHEN YOU
GO IN THE HOUSE,

09:13.954 --> 09:16.724
LOOK AT HER SHOES BEFORE
SHE CALLS YOUR NAME.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.192
DON'T LOOK
AT HER IN THE EYES.
SHE'D LOVE TO SEE YOU.

09:19.292 --> 09:23.196
OH, CHRIST.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TAKE
A STATEMENT LIKE THAT SERIOUSLY.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.532
BUT YOU SAID IT
AND YOU'RE GONNA STICK TO IT.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.668
- AND MAKE HER FEEL GOOD!
- ALL RIGHT.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.670
I'LL SEE YOU
AT JEFF'S TONIGHT.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.907
WHAT'S AT JEFF'S?

09:34.007 --> 09:36.644
OH.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.013
OH, HE'S, UM,
HAVING A LITTLE...

09:41.148 --> 09:43.150
DINNER PARTY.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.418
I GUESS I WASN'T INVITED.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.587
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

09:47.688 --> 09:52.059
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE SURE
BEFORE YOU ASK SOMEBODY,
"AM I GONNA SEE YOU TONIGHT?"

09:52.159 --> 09:54.461
- THAT THEY WERE INVITED?
- I JUST ASSUMED YOU WERE GOING.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.630
- DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING.
- IF THEY HAD TOLD ME

09:56.730 --> 09:59.132
WHO WAS COMING TO THE PARTY,
I WOULD HAVE KNOWN

09:59.232 --> 10:02.402
- AND I WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED,
BUT THEY REFUSED TO TELL ME.
- IT'S NOT YOUR JOB

10:02.502 --> 10:04.437
TO FIND OUT
WHO'S GOING TO A PARTY.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.808
ALL I WANT YOU TO DO
IS ENTERTAIN MY SISTER
FOR TWO HOURS

10:07.908 --> 10:10.077
AND THEN YOU CAN GO
TO YOUR GODDAMN DINNER PARTY.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.680
- SHE BETTER NOT BE DANGEROUS.
- BE THERE AT 1:00, OKAY?

10:12.780 --> 10:15.348
I'LL BE THERE!
I GOTTA SIT IN A ROOM
WITH THAT NUT?

10:30.497 --> 10:32.900
- YOU LOOK GOOD.
- YOU DO.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.467
- THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.636
THANK YOU, JEFF.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.939
AND I APPRECIATE
THE EFFORT, LARRY.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.208
- NO EFFORT.
- NO, IT WAS EFFORTLESS.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.844
OKAY, THEN WE'RE ALL HAPPY.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.645
YEAH.

10:48.015 --> 10:51.518
SO WHAT'S NEW?
( laughs ) RIGHT?

10:51.618 --> 10:53.486
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING?

10:53.586 --> 10:56.957
( laughs )
GUESS WHO TOLD
MARTY TO SHUT UP.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.992
- I GIVE UP.
- WHY, WHAT DID HE SAY? WHO?

10:59.092 --> 11:01.061
- HE DIDN'T TELL YOU?
OH, COME ON.
- Larry: NO NO.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.830
SHE'S GREAT--
A GREAT ACTRESS.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.898
- ANGELINA JOLIE?
- NO!

11:04.998 --> 11:07.334
YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN.
SHE'S AN ACTRESS.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.870
- WHO WHO?
- SHE SAID SHUT UP
RIGHT TO MARTY.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.571
- NICOLE KIDMAN?
- NO!

11:11.671 --> 11:13.040
- JULIA ROBERTS?
- NO!

11:13.140 --> 11:16.509
SHE'S A MULTI--
MULTI-TALENTED.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.345
OH, I KNOW, I KNOW!
HANNAH MONTANA.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.547
- NO, YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING!
- I'M TRYING!

11:20.647 --> 11:22.816
- THE KARDASHIANS!
- WHAT?

11:22.916 --> 11:25.185
NO! YOU KNOW
WHO IT IS!

11:27.520 --> 11:29.389
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA?
- NO.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.725
YEAH, YOU DO.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.468
( singing obscure jingles )

11:52.846 --> 11:54.681
GOT ANYTHING TO EAT?

11:54.782 --> 11:56.850
- NO.
- ANYTHING TO DRINK?

11:56.950 --> 11:59.286
- NOPE.
- NOTHING TO EAT OR DRINK?

11:59.386 --> 12:02.522
- NO, I'M SORRY, NOTHING.
- BOY, THAT'S INTERESTING.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.825
I KNOW. REALLY.
ISN'T IT?

12:04.925 --> 12:07.127
IT IS.
I'M GONNA GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.062
I WAS GONNA GO
TO THE BATHROOM.
CAN I GO FIRST?

12:09.162 --> 12:10.898
I JUST SAID I'M GOING
TO THE BATHROOM.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.000
- BUT I'M SAYING,
COULD I GO FIRST?
- NO NO, I'M GOING FIRST.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.667
- SO WHEN YOU COME BACK,
I'M GONNA GO.
- YES.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.636
OKAY.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.806
YEAH.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.338
( thumping, moaning )

12:54.975 --> 12:56.844
( Bam Bam moaning )

12:59.779 --> 13:03.083
- ( Jeff panting )
- Bam Bam: HEY HEY HEY!

13:03.183 --> 13:06.186
HEY HEY!

13:06.286 --> 13:08.388
HEY HEY HEY HEY!

13:08.488 --> 13:10.757
( moans )
OH HEY!

13:10.858 --> 13:13.894
OH, FUCK ME, FAT BOY!

13:15.362 --> 13:18.365
FUCK ME, FAT BOY!

13:18.465 --> 13:20.633
- SHE'S NOT A MENTAL PATIENT.
- YOU HAD SEX WITH
A MENTAL PATIENT!

13:20.733 --> 13:22.970
- SHE'S NOT A MENTAL PATIENT.
- SHE'S A MENTAL PATIENT.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.872
- SHE'S LIVING AT FUNKHOUSER'S.
- SHE'S A MENTAL PATIENT.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.841
IF I WENT OVER TO THE
INSTITUTION AND FUCKED HER,
THEN SHE'S A MENTAL PATIENT.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.843
WHAT HAPPENED?
I GOT UP TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.812
I WAS SITTING THERE
AND SHE SAID, "I'M BORED."

13:32.913 --> 13:35.048
I SAID, "IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO"--

13:35.148 --> 13:36.416
- YOU SAID THAT?
- THAT'S IT.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.451
- AN EMPTY GESTURE?
- AN EMPTY GESTURE.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.854
- THAT'S HOW THIS
WHOLE THING STARTED.
- THAT'S HOW IT STARTED

13:40.954 --> 13:42.990
- AND THEN I'M OFF
BANGING HER.
- JESUS.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.958
YOU CAN'T MAKE
AN EMPTY GESTURE
TO A FUNKHOUSER.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.327
THEY TAKE YOU UP ON IT.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.868
HOW COME YOU DON'T
HAVE A DOORBELL?

13:54.968 --> 13:57.137
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID?
YOU TOTALLY FUCKED ME.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.306
- WHAT?
- YOU FUCKED ME.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.942
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHAT'D YOU TELL FUNKHOUSER
ABOUT THE PARTY FOR?

14:02.042 --> 14:03.610
PFFT, OH, WHY?
HE SAID SOMETHING?

14:03.710 --> 14:06.179
YEAH, HE SAID SOMETHING.
HE CALLED TO COMPLAIN
HE WASN'T INVITED

14:06.279 --> 14:09.016
- AND SUSIE INVITED HIM.
- OH, THAT IS SO LAME!
YOU KNOW THAT?

14:09.116 --> 14:12.219
- THAT IS SO LAME
TO CALL UP AND DO THAT.
- AND GUESS WHAT ELSE THEY DID.

14:12.319 --> 14:17.424
THEY BROUGHT BAM BAM.
BAM BAM'S HERE!

14:17.524 --> 14:20.527
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HE BROUGHT THAT FUCKING
NUTBAG INTO MY HOUSE!

14:20.627 --> 14:23.496
- OH MY GOD.
- WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU
GO AND TELL HIM FOR?

14:23.596 --> 14:26.166
IF YOU HAD TOLD ME
WHO WAS COMING TO THE PARTY
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

14:26.266 --> 14:29.702
I NEVER WOULD HAVE SAID ANYTHING
TO HIM BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE
KNOWN HE WASN'T COMING.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.940
IT'S CRAZY-- ALL THESE
PARTY RULES: YOU CAN'T
TELL WHO YOU'RE INVITING,

14:33.040 --> 14:34.607
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY
YOU'RE GOING

14:34.707 --> 14:36.143
AND YOU CAN'T TALK
ABOUT IT AFTER.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.245
IT'S LIKE LIVING
IN EAST GERMANY
OR SOMETHING.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.713
NOW I'M SCREWED.
JUST LOOK AT THIS.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.449
- THIS IS CRAZY.
- WHAT IS THAT?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.851
IS THAT DR. SCHAFFER?
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

14:44.952 --> 14:47.220
HE HAD A PARTY RECENTLY.
HE INVITED US.
WE'RE RETURNING THE FAVOR.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.189
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
- AGAIN.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.858
- AGAIN WHAT?
- IF I HAD KNOWN THAT
HE WAS GONNA BE HERE,

14:51.959 --> 14:54.962
- I WOULDN'T HAVE COME.
- IF I HAD KNOWN BAM BAM
WAS GONNA BE HERE,

14:55.062 --> 14:58.698
I WOULD HAVE LEFT TOWN!

14:58.798 --> 15:01.268
- WHO'S THAT GUY
WITH THE DOCTOR?
- THAT'S HIS BOYFRIEND.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.503
- WHAT, SERIOUSLY?
- YEAH, HE'S GAY.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.739
- OH MY GOD, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
- YEAH, LISTEN, I GOTTA
GO HELP SUSIE.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.341
OKAY.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

15:08.441 --> 15:10.377
- HI, MR. DAVID,
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.245
- THIS IS SAM.
- HI. IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.081
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GAY.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.984
UH, YEAH.
IS THAT A SURPRISE TO YOU?

15:17.084 --> 15:18.818
YEAH, I'M A LITTLE
SURPRISED, YEAH.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.720
- WHY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.723
- I JUST DIDN'T
THINK YOU WERE GAY.
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

15:23.823 --> 15:26.994
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
IT MEANS I WAS SURPRISED
TO DISCOVER THAT HE'S GAY.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.896
- THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS.
- BUT WHY? HOW WOULD I SEEM
IF I WAS GAY?

15:29.997 --> 15:32.832
- WHAT IS SEEMING GAY?
- YOU SEEM SLIGHTLY GAY
AND YOU DON'T.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.569
- SO I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF SOMEBODY TOLD ME--
- OH REALLY?

15:36.669 --> 15:38.972
--BUT I'M SURPRISED
THAT SOMEBODY TELLS ME
YOU'RE GAY.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.740
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
IS THAT A CRIME?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.875
- NO, IT'S NOT A CRIME.
IT'S JUST ODD.
- IT'S NOT A CRIME.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.445
- AND IT'S
A LITTLE BIT OFFENSIVE.
- I'M SORRY IF YOU'RE OFFENDED.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.315
- I DON'T THINK
I SAID ANYTHING OFFENSIVE.
- I DON'T ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY

15:48.415 --> 15:50.217
'CAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU ARE SORRY.

15:50.317 --> 15:51.985
HOW ABOUT IF I SAID
I'M PLEASANTLY SURPRISED?

15:52.085 --> 15:53.486
YOU'RE LIVING
IN ANOTHER DECADE,
MR. DAVID.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.922
- I DON'T THINK I AM.
- WELL, I THINK YOU ARE.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.390
- OKAY?
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.926
- FINE, WE DISAGREE.
- OKAY, WE'LL AGREE TO DISAGREE.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.394
ALL RIGHT, GREAT.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.163
UNBELIEVABLE.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.932
WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH BAM BAM?

16:06.033 --> 16:07.767
WHAT? NOTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:07.867 --> 16:10.570
- WHEN YOU CAME
OVER TO THE HOUSE.
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.305
IT'S LIKE A MIRACLE.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.008
I'VE NEVER SEEN
HER SPIRITS LIKE THIS.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.510
I MEAN, THE MEDICINE
AND YOUR VISIT--

16:17.610 --> 16:20.613
- SHE'S A DIFFERENT PERSON.
- THAT IS FANTASTIC!

16:20.713 --> 16:22.515
- WHAT GREAT NEWS.
- I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.717
I-- YOU SHOULDN'T
BE GIVING ME ANY
OF THE CREDIT.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.786
- THIS IS THE MAN--
COME HERE, COME HERE.
- WHAT?

16:26.886 --> 16:29.656
- HE SAYS BAM BAM IS...
- SHHH!

16:29.756 --> 16:31.824
- ...IS LIKE A NEW PERSON.
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

16:31.924 --> 16:33.760
- THAT'S GREAT.
- WERE YOU THERE TOO?

16:33.860 --> 16:36.763
- YEAH!
- NO WONDER SHE WAS SINGING
"I LOVE THE FAT BOY."

16:36.863 --> 16:40.067
- I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
- I LOVE THE FAT BOY.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.901
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
- IT'S GREAT.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.636
I CAN'T THANK
YOU GUYS ENOUGH!

16:43.736 --> 16:45.105
- OH.
- PLEASURE.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.540
- WHAT DID YOU DO?
- WE JUST SAT AND TALKED
WITH HER.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.276
- THAT'S ALL.
- DID YOU PLAY ANY GAMES?

16:49.376 --> 16:51.178
- NO NO NO.
- I LAID SOME GAMES OUT.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.345
- NO.
- NO GAMES, UH-HUH.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.347
DID YOU PLAY A MILLION
PICK-UP STICKS?

16:54.447 --> 16:56.616
- Both: NO NO.
- THE KEY TO THE WHOLE THING?

16:56.716 --> 16:59.519
YOU TREAT THEM NORMAL
AND THEY REALLY RESPOND.

16:59.619 --> 17:03.223
I LOVE BOTH OF YOU
AND YOU GOTTA PROMISE ME
YOU'LL DO IT AGAIN.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.958
- IF WE HAVE TIME.
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.594
OH NO,
YOU GOTTA PROMISE.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.762
- EHHH--
- WE'LL SEE.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.565
- JUST SAY YOU'LL GO OVER THERE.
- Susie: DINNER IS SERVED!

17:12.665 --> 17:15.702
- LET'S GO HAVE SOME DINNER.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH!

17:15.802 --> 17:18.271
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT IT WORKS?
- ABSOLUTELY IT WORKS.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.440
- I DO IT EVERY DAY.
- AND, SAM, YOU'VE USED IT?

17:20.540 --> 17:23.676
- YOU MADE THE SALAD, RIGHT?
- I MADE IT AND I LOVE IT.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.945
( loudly clears throat )

17:26.045 --> 17:28.448
( all chattering )

18:07.454 --> 18:10.022
SUSIE, THESE INGREDIENTS
ARE VERY FRESH AND
WELL PREPARED.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.159
OH, THANK YOU, BAM BAM.
THAT'S SO SWEET OF YOU.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.461
I'M SO GLAD YOU WERE
ABLE TO JOIN US.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.863
I'M SO GLAD YOU STILL HAVE
FOOD IN YOUR FRIDGE

18:16.963 --> 18:19.232
- CONSIDERING LARRY'S AROUND.
- Susie: WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:19.332 --> 18:22.034
LARRY LIKES TO CLEAN OUT
FRIDGES LIKE HE DID TODAY
AT MARTY'S HOUSE.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.503
- WHAT?
- YOU WERE INTO OUR FRIDGE

18:23.603 --> 18:26.206
- UNINVITED, RIGHT?
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.441
OH? THEN MIGHT YOU EXPLAIN
THE WHEREABOUTS

18:28.541 --> 18:30.977
OF THE FRESHLY-SLICED
DELI-PACKAGED TURKEY...

18:31.077 --> 18:34.181
- I DON'T EVEN EAT TURKEY.
- ...THE YELLOW MUSTARD
IN A GLASS JAR

18:34.281 --> 18:36.115
- AND THE LEMONADE SODA?
- WHAT?!

18:36.216 --> 18:38.418
OH, LEMONADE?
SO YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE TOO?

18:38.518 --> 18:40.753
BECAUSE I HAD LEMONADE
AT YOUR HOUSE AND YOU THREW--

18:40.853 --> 18:42.255
PARDON ME--
A SHIT FIT.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.791
ARE YOU KIDDING?
SHE'S EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.059
ARE YOU GONNA BELIEVE
A WORD THIS WOMAN SAYS?

18:47.160 --> 18:49.496
YOU KNOW, I DON'T MIND
IF YOU TAKE LIQUID,

18:49.596 --> 18:52.064
BUT WHEN YOU TAKE REGULAR FOOD,
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.766
I DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING!
THAT'S CRAZY.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.802
SPEAK THE TRUTH.
HELP HIM WITH THE TRUTH,
WOULD YOU, JEFF?

18:55.902 --> 18:58.638
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
I ACTUALLY WASN'T THERE
IN THE KITCHEN.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.374
YOU WERE-- YOU WERE-- OH NO,
YOU WEREN'T. I KNOW
WHERE YOU WERE!

19:01.474 --> 19:03.376

- Susie/Jeff: WHAT?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.678

19:08.181 --> 19:10.950
WHAT THE FUCK IS
SHE TALKING ABOUT JEFF?
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?

19:11.050 --> 19:13.119
- OH, I DID NOTHING.
- Larry: HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.356
- DID YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS POOR DERANGED GIRL?
- ( all shouting )

19:16.456 --> 19:19.526
- YOU ARE SICK!
- SHAME ON YOU.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.562
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.
- Susie: WHAT DID YOU DO NOW?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.897
- SERIOUSLY, HUH?

19:24.997 --> 19:28.167

NOTHING BUT LIES HERE.
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.405
- COME ON!
- WHAT DID YOU DO
TO HER, JEFFREY?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.974
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

19:35.074 --> 19:37.377
SHE'S A NUTBAG!

19:37.477 --> 19:40.247

A MENTAL PATIENT?

19:40.347 --> 19:41.914
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

19:42.014 --> 19:43.716
I BELIEVE YOU!

19:43.816 --> 19:47.454
EVEN BAM BAM IS NOT
CRAZY ENOUGH TO SLEEP
WITH YOU, OKAY?

19:47.554 --> 19:49.656
- ONLY I AM.
- Jeff: THERE YOU GO.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.259
- THERE YOU GO.
- THAT'S EXACTLY--

19:52.359 --> 19:54.861
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
OF COURSE.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.663
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
EVERYBODY,

19:56.763 --> 20:00.267
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE FUNKHOUSER FAMILY.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.834
OH, STOP.
IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.570
- NO NO.
- Jeff: NO NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.

20:03.670 --> 20:07.740
I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO TAKE HER BACK
TO THE INSTITUTION.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.976
I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING:
I THINK IT WOULD BE
GOOD FOR HER.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.645
AND YOU'RE DOING IT
FOR HER OWN SAFETY,
FOR HER OWN GOOD.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.414
- NO, I'M NOT SO CERTAIN.
- NO, IT'S GOOD.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.416
IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC.
IT'S A GREAT THING,

20:16.516 --> 20:18.651
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOTTA
THINK OF THE LONG HAUL.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.453
IN THE LONG HAUL,
YOU WANT HER BACK.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.522
- MAYBE SHE NEEDS HELP BACK.
- Susie: YOU WANT TO HELP HER.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.292
- LOOK LOOK LOOK, JUST DROP IT.
- ( cell phone ringing )

20:25.392 --> 20:27.460
LET'S ENJOY OUR DINNER.
I'M SORRY THIS HAPPENED.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.262
THE BEST SALAD
ANYBODY EVER MADE.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.964
- Susie: THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.
- HELLO?

20:32.064 --> 20:34.166
WHAT?
HOLD ON, HEY, WHAT?

20:34.267 --> 20:36.102
OH, OKAY.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.771
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GO PICK IT UP.
NO, I'LL LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

20:38.871 --> 20:41.441
- Susie: YOU'RE LEAVING?
- I'M SO SORRY.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.776
I HAVE TO GO.
I HAVE TO PICK UP
LORETTA'S MEDICATION.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.913
- YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT TO HER YET?
- NO, I'VE GOTTA GET IT
FROM THE PHARMACY.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.649
- I'M SORRY, SHE'S SICK.
- YOU'RE LEAVING, I HAVEN'T
SERVED THE ENTREE YET.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.352
IT'S SAD BECAUSE I'M HAVING
SO MUCH FUN HERE, AND THEN--

20:52.452 --> 20:54.321
AND I GOTTA GO AND--
MAYBE I'LL COME BACK.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.022

COMING BACK.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.790
GO GO GO!

21:00.760 --> 21:03.262
I GOT THE PRESCRIPTION,
AUNTIE RAE. I'M JUST GONNA
GET SOME FOOD TO GO.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.231
- COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
- WHAT?

21:05.332 --> 21:08.501
COULD YOU GO UP TO LORETTA
AND ASK HER WHAT THE NAME
OF THAT RESTAURANT WAS

21:08.601 --> 21:10.337
WE ATE IN IN SANTA MONICA
A FEW WEEKS AGO?

21:10.437 --> 21:11.771
- NO.
- Why not?

21:11.871 --> 21:14.240
- Because she's resting.
- IS SHE SLEEPING?

21:14.341 --> 21:16.208
- NO.
- Can she talk?

21:16.309 --> 21:18.378
- YES.
- SO LET HER TALK.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.381
NO. I DON'T WANT HER TALKING.
I WANT HER RESTING.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.716
RESTING?
WHAT DOES RESTING EVEN MEAN?

21:23.816 --> 21:26.886
SHE'S NOT SLEEPING, IS SHE?
YOU CAN TALK AND REST.

21:26.986 --> 21:30.122
LARRY, I AM NOT GONNA BOTHER
LORETTA WITH THIS BULLSHIT.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

21:30.222 --> 21:32.325

21:37.029 --> 21:39.466

24:06.746 --> 24:10.382
ALWAYS AT THE HOUSE AND YOU

24:10.483 --> 24:12.418
AND YOU--
IT WAS JUST DIFFERENT.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.754

VERY UPSETTING.
- DR. SCHAFFER,

27:33.085 --> 27:34.787

27:34.887 --> 27:37.724
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
NOW...

27:37.824 --> 27:39.759
THIS IS REALLY WHERE
THE HARD WORK STARTS.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.528
SHE'S GONNA

THERE'S A LOT OF VITAMINS,

27:42.628 --> 27:44.864

KEEP THE HOUSE WARMER.
KEEP IT AT ABOUT 78Â°

27:51.337 --> 27:54.006
TO 82Â° MINIMUM.
THE WARMER THE BETTER, REALLY.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.008
THAT HELPS
WITH THE HEALING PROCESS.

27:56.108 --> 27:59.645
I KNOW THIS IS
A LOT TO TAKE IN,
BUT IF YOU GUYS WORK HARD,

27:59.746 --> 28:03.682
ESPECIALLY YOU, IN TWO,
THREE, MAYBE FOUR YEARS,
SHE'S HOPEFULLY GONNA BE FINE.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.218
- DID YOU SAY FOUR YEARS?
- COULD BE, YEAH.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.121
AND YOUR LIFE IS MOSTLY GOING
TO BE TAKING HER TO APPOINTMENTS

28:09.221 --> 28:10.522
OR HERE WITH HER
IN THE HOUSE.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.091
I-I CAN STILL
PLAY GOLF.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.794
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I DON'T IMAGINE
YOU'D HAVE TIME FOR THAT.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.963
- ONCE A WEEK?
- NO TIMES A WEEK.

28:17.063 --> 28:19.531
- YOU WON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT.
- WHAT? NINE HOLES.

28:19.631 --> 28:22.368
ZERO HOLES, MR. DAVID!
THIS IS SERIOUS.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.371
NOW I WON'T LIE--
THINGS ARE GOING TO GET UGLY.

28:25.471 --> 28:28.107
THERE'S GOING TO BE VOMITING.
THERE'S GOING TO BE
INCONTINENCE,

28:28.207 --> 28:30.042
DEPRESSION,
UNSIGHTLY HAIR LOSS,

28:30.142 --> 28:32.178
WEIGHT LOSS.
SHE'LL BE IRRITABLE.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.047
LOTS OF MASSIVE MOOD SWINGS.
SHE COULD GET VIOLENT.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.249
HYSTERIA,
INCONTINENCE--

28:37.349 --> 28:38.818
HAVE I ALREADY
SAID THAT?

28:38.918 --> 28:41.287
