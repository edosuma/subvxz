Your Grace,
the Queen is with child.

before they rang the bells.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.522
Is it true?

04:58.523 --> 05:00.082
There are symptoms.

her breasts have some milk,

We do thank God for this,

We must also thank His Majesty
for this blessed event,

short of a miracle.

it is safely dispatched,

Sir Thomas Wyatt

06:11.029 --> 06:17.264
these Protestants and heretics

06:22.641 --> 06:24.041
She's plainly guilty.

06:24.042 --> 06:25.342

06:25.343 --> 06:27.978
As long as she remains alive,

06:27.979 --> 06:30.915
there will be plots
to raise her to the throne.

I agree with His Grace.
She is a heretic.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.727
She must never be
allowed to succeed.

06:43.728 --> 06:45.128
But if she...

06:46.798 --> 06:49.166
If she were
brought properly to trial,

06:49.167 --> 06:51.335
she would not be found guilty,

06:51.336 --> 06:53.532
and we would all be condemned.

She will never rule England.

some proof of her treachery.

It is plain enough.

12:10.155 --> 12:11.255
Where is your proof?

12:11.256 --> 12:13.090
It was to your advantage.

12:13.091 --> 12:14.925
You must let me
see the Queen. I must...

12:14.926 --> 12:18.760

and the Catholic faith!

small truth in these charges,

12:47.959 --> 12:52.429
however innocently
or unknowingly you
did proceed,

12:52.430 --> 12:54.228
you had best confess.

tear ourselves apart

he was also my father.

your crimes against me?

I have committed none.

were even conceivable.

My lady, I bring a message.

23:32.870 --> 23:35.168
The King of Spain
is enraptured,

23:35.773 --> 23:37.764
and offers you
his hand in marriage.

23:37.908 --> 23:39.899
My sister is not yet dead.

23:40.578 --> 23:42.375
Her bed is still warm.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.782
His Majesty finds it
already cold.

23:59.997 --> 24:03.991
You must sign it.
For the love of God, sign it.

24:07.972 --> 24:10.702
Will you leave
your kingdom to a heretic?

24:17.915 --> 24:19.482
ELIZABETH: He then said

24:19.483 --> 24:21.818
that this King would marry me,

24:21.819 --> 24:26.623
but would not expect to
share my bed more than
two or three times a year.

24:26.624 --> 24:28.182
As much as that?

24:30.928 --> 24:32.657
Well, if he...

24:33.164 --> 24:34.898
He is enraptured...

24:34.899 --> 24:36.230
Naturally.

24:38.402 --> 24:42.305
But his affairs would
otherwise keep him in Spain.

24:44.141 --> 24:46.007
Then the King is a fool.

24:51.015 --> 24:54.974
For what affairs could ever
be important enough
to keep him from your bed?

25:04.762 --> 25:08.630
Robert, you should not say
such things.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.461
Then I shall only think them.

25:15.339 --> 25:18.408
Oh, everything's
still so uncertain.

25:18.409 --> 25:21.077
Sir William says that
my life is still in danger.

25:21.078 --> 25:23.103
Do not listen to everything
Sir William tells you.

25:23.247 --> 25:26.546
Do not listen to any of them.
None of them
are of consequence.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.017
When you are Queen...

25:28.018 --> 25:30.419
I am not...
I am not Queen yet.

You will be.

nothing to you.

I will mean nothing to you.

Oh, how could you ever
be nothing to me?

you are everything to me.

GARDINER:
God save Your Majesty.

31:15.732 --> 31:16.866
SIR WILLIAM:
Your Majesty should know

31:16.867 --> 31:21.437
that you have inherited
a most powerless
and degenerate state.

31:21.438 --> 31:24.607
It's threatened from abroad
by the ambitions of
France and Spain

31:24.608 --> 31:29.178
and is weaker in strength,
in men, moneys, and riches

31:29.179 --> 31:30.713
than I have ever known it.

31:30.714 --> 31:31.781
What are you saying?

31:31.782 --> 31:33.849
Madam, your treasury is empty.

31:33.850 --> 31:37.653
The navy is run down,
there is no standing army,

31:37.654 --> 31:39.956
and we are bare of munitions.

31:39.957 --> 31:44.160
There isn't a fortress left
in England that could
withstand a single shot.

31:44.161 --> 31:45.924
I have no desire
to go to war, sir.

31:46.063 --> 31:48.197
But that is not the end of it.

31:48.198 --> 31:51.896
Apart from abroad,
here at home there are those
who wish Your Majesty ill.

31:52.035 --> 31:56.172
Mary of Scots has already
laid claim to your throne.

31:56.173 --> 32:00.041
And Norfolk. Norfolk
covets it relentlessly.

32:01.411 --> 32:03.279
Madam.

32:03.280 --> 32:09.219
Until you marry
and produce an heir,
you will find no security.

33:48.352 --> 33:51.387
That is

33:51.388 --> 33:53.122
He is returned from exile now

33:53.123 --> 33:57.390

34:17.280 --> 34:18.373
Majesty.

34:18.614 --> 34:22.318
May I present the French
ambassador, His Excellency,
Monsieur de Foix.

34:22.319 --> 34:23.911
Your Excellency.

34:25.255 --> 34:28.282
I suppose the French do offer
some suitor to her.

34:30.159 --> 34:31.491
Naturally.

34:32.161 --> 34:35.223
Everything now depends upon
the husband that woman takes.

34:35.498 --> 34:38.501
King Henry of Anjou sends you
his brotherly love.

34:38.502 --> 34:41.003
He trusts that
with your accession,

34:41.004 --> 34:44.172
the relationship between
our countries may be
much improved.

34:44.174 --> 34:45.841
That is also my hope.

34:45.842 --> 34:48.811
With such consideration,
the King expects

34:48.812 --> 34:52.407
that you will consider
the suit of his brother,
the Duke of Anjou.

34:52.549 --> 34:56.815
Well, naturally, Her Majesty
will consider the proposal
most carefully.

35:00.657 --> 35:04.855
It is unfortunate, however,
that at this time the Duke's
aunt, Mary of Guise,

35:05.328 --> 35:08.958
chooses to garrison Scotland
with French troops.

35:13.370 --> 35:14.667
Ladies?

35:20.143 --> 35:22.011
The marriage of a Queen,
Excellency,

35:22.012 --> 35:24.674
is born of politics,
not of childish passion.

My Lady, I'm sorry.

41:27.644 --> 41:30.279
Mary of Guise has increased

in Scotland

by 4,000 men.

41:32.148 --> 41:33.878
Perhaps more.

the French mean to attack

and while Your Majesty's reign
is still uncertain.

41:48.565 --> 41:49.731

we look to you for action,

be slow to take action

he does not come to be
afraid of his own shadow.

such a mistake.

unfit to rule.

Well, that is what
you all think, is it not,
Walsingham?

49:10.039 --> 49:12.201
It is not for me to judge you.

49:15.011 --> 49:16.845
Why did they send
such children?

49:16.846 --> 49:19.648
Why did they not send
proper reinforcements?

49:19.649 --> 49:21.879
Because the bishops
would not let them.

49:22.318 --> 49:24.844
They spoke against it
in the pulpits.

Then they are speaking
against their Queen.

against you
and have no fear of you.

to survive.

That Your Majesty considers

God has placed me here.

52:58.667 --> 53:01.603
I am your anointed sovereign.

53:01.604 --> 53:05.700
I am your Queen and,
like my father,
I mean to rule.

53:05.841 --> 53:08.643
There is one thing higher
than royalty, my lords,

53:08.644 --> 53:11.841
and that is religion.

53:14.617 --> 53:16.483
I pass this Act of...

53:16.819 --> 53:18.719
I ask you to...

53:18.954 --> 53:21.287
I ask you to pass
this Act of Uniformity.

53:22.391 --> 53:23.483
It's not for myself.
It's for my people.

53:26.362 --> 53:28.262
They're my people.

53:28.898 --> 53:30.732
My lords, there is one God.
We have a common...

53:30.733 --> 53:32.098
There is one God.

53:32.268 --> 53:33.496
(GRUNTS)

53:33.769 --> 53:37.038
This is for my people.
My people are my care...

53:37.039 --> 53:38.336
Only care.

53:39.441 --> 53:42.809
The truth be, my lords,
your votes are nothing
without my consent.

53:42.945 --> 53:44.504
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

53:56.959 --> 54:02.762
(YELLING) If there
is no uniformity
of religious belief here,

54:03.365 --> 54:06.665
then there can only be
fragmentation,

(ALL CLAMORING)

54:09.605 --> 54:12.006
Dispute, and quarrel.

54:13.776 --> 54:20.307
Surely, my lords,
it is better to have
a single Church of England.

54:29.291 --> 54:32.560
A single Church of England

54:32.561 --> 54:34.120
with a common prayer book...

54:35.030 --> 54:36.896
And a...

54:39.602 --> 54:42.594
And a common purpose.

54:47.476 --> 54:50.878
Now, I ask you to pass
this Act of Uniformity not...

54:52.381 --> 54:54.406
Not for myself,

54:55.284 --> 54:57.776
but for my people,

55:00.522 --> 55:02.718
who are my only care.

55:03.625 --> 55:05.960
BISHOP: Madam, by this act...

55:05.961 --> 55:10.728
By this act, you force us
to relinquish our allegiance
to the Holy Father.

55:15.804 --> 55:18.603
How can I force you,
Your Grace?

55:19.074 --> 55:20.804
I am a woman.

55:23.879 --> 55:27.941
I have no desire to make
windows into men's souls.

55:30.085 --> 55:31.610
I simply ask,

55:33.589 --> 55:40.261
can any man, in truth,
serve two masters
and be faithful to both?

55:40.262 --> 55:43.231
Madam, this... This is heresy!

55:43.232 --> 55:44.732
Heresy indeed!
MAN: Heresy indeed!

55:44.733 --> 55:48.431
No, Your Grace.
This is common sense,

55:49.138 --> 55:51.732
which is a most
English virtue.

55:55.644 --> 55:57.772
Where is Gardiner?
Where are the others?

55:58.480 --> 55:59.814
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

56:04.687 --> 56:06.985
BISHOP 2:
This is Walsingham's doing.

56:08.057 --> 56:09.684
It is the devil's work.

56:09.858 --> 56:12.327
It will not serve her
in any case.

56:12.995 --> 56:17.728
The bishops will pass
no measure which
severs us from Rome.

56:20.602 --> 56:24.630
BISHOP: Your Majesty would
improve all these matters

56:24.840 --> 56:27.308
if you would agree to marry.

56:27.309 --> 56:29.437
Aye. Marry, then.

56:30.045 --> 56:31.035
Aye.

56:31.680 --> 56:35.173
But marry who, Your Grace?

56:35.317 --> 56:37.650
Will you give me
some suggestion?

56:39.521 --> 56:43.558
For some say France,
and others Spain,

56:43.559 --> 56:46.460
and some cannot
abide foreigners at all.

56:47.429 --> 56:51.832
So I'm not sure how best to
please you unless I married
one of each.

56:58.307 --> 57:01.576
Now Your Majesty does make fun
of the sanctity of marriage.

57:01.577 --> 57:06.071
I do not think
you should lecture me
on that, my lord,

57:06.315 --> 57:09.774
since you yourself
have been twice divorced

57:10.753 --> 57:13.313
and are now upon
your third wife.

57:19.995 --> 57:23.795
Each of you must vote
according to your conscience.

57:26.001 --> 57:29.237
But remember this.

57:29.238 --> 57:35.109
In your hands,
upon this moment,

57:35.511 --> 57:39.607
lies the future happiness
of my people

57:39.748 --> 57:44.345
and the peace of this realm.

57:45.988 --> 57:49.390

but you're now free to go.

58:19.788 --> 58:24.487
I am sure this infernal work
has not saved
your bastard Queen.

Her Majesty has won
the argument.

By five, Your Grace.

58:37.272 --> 58:38.365
Five.

58:40.642 --> 58:42.611

We shall think on it.

But I am deeply religious.

01:01:09.491 --> 01:01:11.289

too, huh?

Very religious, yes.

01:01:56.405 --> 01:02:00.307
what is the news
of our brothers
and sisters in England?

Do they still support
the sovereignty of that
illegitimate whore?

01:02:05.313 --> 01:02:06.542
No, Holy Father.

They pray ceaselessly
that England may be
recovered from heresy.

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.086
Prayers may not be sufficient.

in this matter,
but do not despair.

You may tell the Duke
that he shall have his answer
shortly.

Oh, madam!
The point is pressing.

01:10:43.998 --> 01:10:48.969
The Duke cannot love me
so much if he demands
my answer so precipitously.

Perhaps Her Majesty
will not answer

01:10:51.172 --> 01:10:54.506

already set upon another.

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:26.563
Imagine being discovered
in another woman's bed.

01:12:28.336 --> 01:12:30.031
COURTIER: You mean
his wife's bed.

01:12:41.416 --> 01:12:44.718
COURTIER 3: Lord Robert,
we are amazed you show
your face at court.

01:12:44.719 --> 01:12:46.278
COURTIER: The Queen!

01:13:27.095 --> 01:13:28.722
English pirate!

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:50.684
English pirate!

01:13:50.685 --> 01:13:54.178
It's not enough that
English pirates attack
and rob our ships,

01:13:54.655 --> 01:13:57.591
but we have to be made
fools of in this court.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.896
The King, my master,
has become impatient
for Your Grace to act.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.232
If you will not,
then others may.

01:14:10.204 --> 01:14:13.197
You must reassure His Majesty
that the time is
close at hand.

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:15.774
He must not act
precipitously.

01:14:16.077 --> 01:14:17.510
PERFORMER: English pirate!

01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:21.381
His Majesty has also
heard a rumor.

01:14:21.382 --> 01:14:23.550
The world is filled
with rumors, Monsignor.

01:14:23.551 --> 01:14:26.219
That Your Grace has made
contact with Mary of Scots

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.120
to promote your ambitions.

01:14:29.857 --> 01:14:32.156
Even that you mean
to marry her.

01:14:32.393 --> 01:14:34.123
Do you suppose me an idiot?

01:14:35.463 --> 01:14:37.464
Your master is the most
powerful man in the world.

01:14:37.465 --> 01:14:39.126
I would not cross him
for my life.

01:14:46.908 --> 01:14:48.875
Did the Duke
not come to dance?

01:14:48.876 --> 01:14:51.411
Madam, His Grace is
unfortunately indisposed.

01:14:51.412 --> 01:14:53.403
He has some pains
of the stomach.

01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:57.342
Oh. I am very sorry for it.

01:15:04.192 --> 01:15:05.523
(MUSIC STOPS)

01:15:05.693 --> 01:15:08.594
We wish to give
the Duke this ring

01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:10.829
as a token of our love.

01:15:11.666 --> 01:15:13.293
Madam, allow me...
No.

01:15:13.901 --> 01:15:16.302
I shall give it to him myself.

01:15:17.839 --> 01:15:20.774
Madam, I should not...
Sir William.

01:15:21.042 --> 01:15:22.407
Come along.

01:15:38.259 --> 01:15:40.387

(DUKE LAUGHING)

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:31.705
What?

01:16:33.447 --> 01:16:34.779
What?

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:38.208
What? What?

01:16:44.025 --> 01:16:45.652
You stare, madame.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:55.893
What is it?
Do you see something
strange, perhaps?

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.932
You are wearing a dress,
Your Grace.

01:17:02.843 --> 01:17:04.144
Oh.

01:17:04.145 --> 01:17:07.514
Yes, I am wearing a dress.
Yes, yes,
I am wearing a dress.

01:17:07.515 --> 01:17:10.678
I wear a dress like this,
my mother, and you.

01:17:10.818 --> 01:17:15.346
But I only dress like this
when I'm alone,
in private with my friends.

01:17:17.725 --> 01:17:19.090
Your Grace.

01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:42.549
Although my affection for you
is undiminished,

01:17:43.217 --> 01:17:46.786
I have, after
an agonizing struggle,

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:50.952
determined to sacrifice
my own happiness
for the welfare of my people.

01:17:51.225 --> 01:17:52.693
Oh! My God.

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.055
(LAUGHS)

01:18:00.067 --> 01:18:01.694

01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:11.371
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:32.665
Madam, is the Duke...

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:35.261
There will be
no more talk of marriage.

01:18:38.606 --> 01:18:39.596
(LAUGHS)

01:18:55.256 --> 01:18:56.621

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.228
Your Majesty.

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:06.022
Will you dance?

01:19:08.736 --> 01:19:10.363
If it please you.

01:19:16.944 --> 01:19:18.412
Play a volta.

01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:30.323
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:19:34.462 --> 01:19:36.123
Why will you not see me?

01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:54.408
You must let me explain.
Others will take advantage
of this.

01:19:55.049 --> 01:19:57.016
You must not believe
what they tell you.

01:19:57.017 --> 01:19:58.747
They are jealous.

01:19:58.886 --> 01:20:00.786
And envious.

01:20:01.188 --> 01:20:05.091
Because I am nothing to them,
and everything to you.

01:20:05.593 --> 01:20:07.618
Do you love her?

01:20:12.166 --> 01:20:15.135
No. I love you.
I have always loved you.

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:17.601
I was afraid of losing you,
because I was not free.

01:20:18.906 --> 01:20:21.705
For God's sake,
you are still my Elizabeth.

01:20:23.043 --> 01:20:26.707
No. I am not your Elizabeth!

01:20:29.083 --> 01:20:30.915
I am no man's Elizabeth.

01:20:31.151 --> 01:20:34.417
And if you think to rule her,
you are mistaken.

01:20:40.694 --> 01:20:42.890
I will have one mistress here!

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.891
And no master!

01:21:19.266 --> 01:21:23.601
ROBERT:
It matters nothing to me.
I can live without her.

01:21:24.071 --> 01:21:25.539
Most happily.

01:21:26.473 --> 01:21:28.874
Better than I could
live with her.

01:21:30.945 --> 01:21:33.038
I have no need of her love.

01:21:33.514 --> 01:21:35.949
Have not I
suffered enough already,

01:21:36.517 --> 01:21:38.484
for loving her and showing it?

01:21:38.485 --> 01:21:43.082
I envy you, my lord,
to love a woman so deeply.

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:48.185
Monsignor,
envy no man for that.

01:21:50.264 --> 01:21:53.598
Such love is hateful.
It tears the soul apart.

01:21:55.202 --> 01:21:57.694
Envy a man who has
never known such love.

01:21:58.439 --> 01:22:02.041
Perhaps there may still be
a way to reclaim her
affections.

01:22:02.042 --> 01:22:03.309
Why should I want to?

01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:05.108
And to save her life.

01:22:05.679 --> 01:22:08.171
You jest with me.
No. Indeed, I do not.

01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:10.550
For she will be
dead soon enough,

01:22:10.551 --> 01:22:14.920
perhaps even at Norfolk's
hand, if you do not help her.

01:22:17.491 --> 01:22:23.396
How can I help her?
She will not even see me.

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:33.406
CARDINAL: His Holiness
has issued the bull.

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:36.909
It deprives Elizabeth,
the pretended
Queen of England,

01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:39.675
servant of wickedness,
of her throne,

01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:46.217
and declares that henceforth
her subjects are absolved
of their allegiance to her.

01:22:48.455 --> 01:22:52.256
His Holiness also
decrees that any man

01:22:52.493 --> 01:22:56.095
who should undertake
her assassination

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:59.532
will be welcomed by angels
into the kingdom of heaven.

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:05.531
Give these letters of
blessing and hope
to our friends in England.

your master well, Elyot.

01:24:28.422 --> 01:24:30.288

too hasty at rejecting
the Duke's proposal
of marriage.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:04.423

such a woman?
Huh? She is frigid.

nothing more.

01:33:58.625 --> 01:34:00.525
He would not expect to...

01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:03.627
He would live in Spain.

01:34:05.632 --> 01:34:07.657
Why do you do this, Robert?

01:34:08.702 --> 01:34:10.431
Because I love you,

01:34:12.439 --> 01:34:16.408
and though you will not
see me, I am the only one
who would care for you.

01:34:16.409 --> 01:34:20.746
You love me so much,
you would have me
be your whore?

01:34:20.747 --> 01:34:21.737
(SCOFFS)

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:30.051
For God's sake,
I do this for us.

01:34:30.523 --> 01:34:33.392
I ask you to save
some part of us!

01:34:33.393 --> 01:34:37.162
Lord Robert, you may make
whores of my ladies,

01:34:37.163 --> 01:34:39.496
but you shall not
make one of me.

01:34:49.275 --> 01:34:50.436
Your Majesty.

(DUKE OF ANJOU CRYING)

01:35:27.514 --> 01:35:29.072
Of course, I shall deny it!

01:35:29.849 --> 01:35:32.944
But Your Majesty must
publicly dissociate herself

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.148
from this most bloody act.

01:35:36.489 --> 01:35:37.786
I never ordered it.

01:35:41.094 --> 01:35:43.187
Of course, madam, of course.

01:35:43.530 --> 01:35:46.966
You must also make
conciliatory gestures
towards the Spanish.

01:35:47.567 --> 01:35:52.604
Your dependence
upon their goodwill is
even greater than ever.

01:35:52.605 --> 01:35:56.906
I really must insist...
The word "must"
is not used to princes.

01:36:01.247 --> 01:36:04.809
I have followed your advice
in all the affairs
of my kingdom,

01:36:06.286 --> 01:36:08.187
but your policies would make
England nothing

01:36:08.188 --> 01:36:10.588
but either part of France
or Spain.

01:36:13.993 --> 01:36:17.529
From this moment,
I am going to follow
my own opinion,

01:36:17.530 --> 01:36:18.597
and see if I do any better.

01:36:18.598 --> 01:36:20.365
Forgive me, madam,
but you're only a woman.

01:36:20.366 --> 01:36:23.666
I may be a woman, Sir William,
but if I choose,
I have the heart of a man.

01:36:29.242 --> 01:36:31.233
I am my father's daughter.

01:36:32.645 --> 01:36:34.739
I am not afraid of anything.

01:36:36.182 --> 01:36:37.240
SIR WILLIAM: I...

01:36:39.752 --> 01:36:41.618
I deeply regret, madam,

01:36:42.655 --> 01:36:45.022
if I have caused you
such offense.

01:36:46.326 --> 01:36:50.558
Though God knows all my advice
has only ever been

01:36:53.466 --> 01:36:55.730
to secure
Your Majesty's throne.

01:36:56.436 --> 01:36:58.404
And I am grateful for it.

01:37:05.011 --> 01:37:09.244
I have decided to
create you Lord Burghley,

01:37:09.716 --> 01:37:12.184
so you may enjoy
your retirement
in greater ease.

01:37:12.185 --> 01:37:13.318
Madam...

01:37:13.319 --> 01:37:15.618
That will be all,
Lord Burghley.

01:37:24.197 --> 01:37:25.426
Majesty.

01:37:54.561 --> 01:37:56.153
Madam, if I may.

01:37:58.231 --> 01:38:01.033
A prince should never flinch
from being blamed

01:38:01.034 --> 01:38:02.467
for acts of ruthlessness

01:38:03.202 --> 01:38:06.195
which are necessary
for safeguarding the state

01:38:07.473 --> 01:38:09.271
and their own person.

01:38:11.411 --> 01:38:13.979
You must take these things
so much to heart

01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:16.005
that you do not fear
to strike.

01:38:17.417 --> 01:38:20.011
Even the very nearest
that you have.

01:38:22.121 --> 01:38:23.953
If they be implicated.

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.253
It has been made known to me

01:38:30.163 --> 01:38:33.360
there is a priest abroad
in the land
carrying letters from Rome

01:38:34.033 --> 01:38:36.434
to those who mean to harm you.

01:38:39.505 --> 01:38:41.974
Norfolk's power in court
is growing.

01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:45.611
It is said that he and his
foreign allies are raising

01:38:45.612 --> 01:38:48.979
an army that will
outnumber your own.

01:38:49.315 --> 01:38:53.377
If Your Majesty does not
act soon, then he will.

01:38:56.222 --> 01:38:58.987
Find the priest
and those who harbor him.

every room! You, upstairs!

01:39:05.264 --> 01:39:07.392

Where is Lord Arundel?

01:39:22.482 --> 01:39:24.211
He's not here, sir.

letters from the Pope.

01:40:26.412 --> 01:40:28.403
To whom were you
told to give them?

(SCREAMS)

01:40:40.026 --> 01:40:41.255

01:40:42.729 --> 01:40:44.458
what is God to you?

01:40:46.799 --> 01:40:48.597
Has he abandoned you?

01:40:50.036 --> 01:40:52.404
Is he such a worldly God
that he must play at politics

01:40:52.405 --> 01:40:54.373
and the filth of conspiracy?

01:40:56.342 --> 01:40:58.834
Is he not divine?

01:41:00.279 --> 01:41:01.713
Tell me the truth

01:41:02.415 --> 01:41:04.611

with him now.

A man will confess to anything
under torture.

And Lord Robert Dudley,
Earl of Leicester.

01:42:01.274 --> 01:42:05.939

also found among
the priest's possessions.

"who now sits

01:42:33.539 --> 01:42:37.305
All Norfolk need do
is sign this paper,

01:42:38.811 --> 01:42:41.405
and treason would have
been committed.

01:42:42.882 --> 01:42:44.748
Then let him sign it.

01:42:47.186 --> 01:42:49.052
And let it all be done.

when England is safe
again and faithful,

01:43:16.048 --> 01:43:19.450
they will thank me
for this act and forget
the manner of it.

Is it not true?

01:47:42.948 --> 01:47:44.949
You must go with these men
to the Tower.

I must do nothing
by your orders. I am Norfolk.

01:47:48.387 --> 01:47:50.014
You were Norfolk.

The dead have no titles.

01:48:02.701 --> 01:48:05.569
You were the most powerful man
in England.

01:48:07.907 --> 01:48:10.171
And could have been
greater still,

01:48:10.676 --> 01:48:13.543
but you had not the courage
to be loyal.

Only the conviction
of your own vanity.

01:48:20.152 --> 01:48:23.349
I think, Walsingham,
a man's courage is in
the manner of his death.

01:48:26.058 --> 01:48:28.550
I'm content to die
for my beliefs.

01:48:30.896 --> 01:48:35.299
So cut off my head
and make me a martyr.

remember it.

That I did it
only for my faith.

You must not think
we care not for your children.

Your Majesty is merciful
and forgiving.

01:49:41.133 --> 01:49:43.124
What kept you, Walsingham?

01:49:46.138 --> 01:49:47.765
I've been waiting.

They're all gone to the Tower,

Is it not plain enough to you?

It is no easy thing
to be loved by the Queen.

01:51:06.652 --> 01:51:09.280
It would corrupt
the soul of any man.

to let you live.

committed treason.

01:51:33.746 --> 01:51:36.681
And I will make
an example of him.

01:51:42.321 --> 01:51:44.813

01:51:50.829 --> 01:51:53.025
of how close I came to danger.

of her enemies.

01:52:58.764 --> 01:53:00.391
What do I do now?

01:53:01.767 --> 01:53:03.735
Am I to be made of stone?

01:53:06.338 --> 01:53:08.873
Must I be touched by nothing?

Aye, madam. To reign supreme.

greater than themselves

to look up to and worship.

01:53:27.593 --> 01:53:30.289
They must be able
to touch the divine...

Here on earth.

01:53:43.375 --> 01:53:46.675
She had such power
over men's hearts.

01:53:52.551 --> 01:53:54.212
They died for her.

01:53:56.522 --> 01:53:59.457
They have found nothing
to replace her.
