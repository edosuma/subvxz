WEBVTT

00:10.600 --> 00:12.600
Need to get the carousel
winterized.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.080
Also check into switââ

00:13.080 --> 00:14.500
Ohh!
Ohh!

00:14.600 --> 00:15.460
Sorry about that.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.660
No, I'm sorry.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.760
I just get so caught up
in my work.

00:18.040 --> 00:19.140
Me, too.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.220
Hey, wait a sec.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.620
I have the exact same
clip...board.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.260
You're Benson.
How'd you know?

00:27.360 --> 00:28.780
I've been watching you.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.900
Or, I mean,
not in aâa creepy stalker way.

00:31.000 --> 00:31.900
It's my job.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.260
Right.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.020
So...how's that fax
working out?

00:36.120 --> 00:37.700
Oh.
It's okay.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.340
Well,
I think it's really cool.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.500
Yeah, I get a lot
of important messages

00:41.600 --> 00:43.660
from Langer
and the dome big wigs.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.620
And in an emergency,
got the old speed dial here.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.500
If you hear
this baby ringing ââ

00:48.600 --> 00:50.820
Oh, geez.
I am so sorry.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.220
Oh, no worries.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.320
It's just one of Langer's
terrible protein bars.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.700
He only allows "sanctioned food"
in the domeâitory.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.100
What I wouldn't give
for some hot wings.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.020
Wait.
You like hot wings?

01:01.120 --> 01:03.860
Uh, yeah!
It's literally my favorite food.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.340
Me, too.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.380
Well, maybe I'll just
have to swing by your lab

01:07.480 --> 01:08.660
and drop some off.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.460
Oh, yeah?
( Chuckles )

01:10.560 --> 01:12.820
You're gonna sneak
past the guards?

01:12.920 --> 01:13.580
Maybe I will.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.340
Well, if you do that,

01:15.440 --> 01:18.220
then you'll be
my favorite person ever.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.780
( Both laugh )

01:19.880 --> 01:21.740
( Sighs )
( Pager beeping )

01:21.840 --> 01:23.660
Oh, geez. Langer.
I got to go.

01:23.760 --> 01:24.780
Oh, yeah.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.780
Sorry.
It was nice.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.620
( Whispering )
By the way, it's Pam.
What?

01:28.720 --> 01:32.200
Ohh.
My name is Paâaâaâaâm!

01:33.280 --> 01:34.180
( Sighs )

01:34.280 --> 01:35.340
Pam.

01:35.440 --> 01:37.440
Rigby:
( Singsong voice ) Benson.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.860
Wha...?

01:37.960 --> 01:39.740
Dude, what's wrong
with your face?

01:39.840 --> 01:40.980
He's glowing.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.080
I've never seen him
like this before.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.740
Yeah.
It's weird.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.860
I just met
the most amazing girl.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.460
We had a real chemistry.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.500
Gross.
Benson, I'm trying to eat here.

01:49.600 --> 01:50.780
Eat?
The wings!

01:50.880 --> 01:52.220
I got to get her wings!

01:52.320 --> 01:54.320
How can I ask her out
if I don't have wings?!

01:55.440 --> 01:57.460
Wait, Benson,
that's our stuff!

01:57.560 --> 01:58.420
( Tires squeal )

01:58.520 --> 02:00.300
Hey, want to go to the spot?

02:00.400 --> 02:01.220
Yeah, I do.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.560
( Both guffaw )

02:05.280 --> 02:07.940
Hmm. Hmm.
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.020
What would Pam want?
Regular?

02:10.120 --> 02:11.060
One order of reââ

02:11.160 --> 02:12.340
No, wait. Spicy.
One order ââ

02:12.440 --> 02:13.820
What if she doesn't like spicy?

02:13.920 --> 02:14.900
I'll get half spicy.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.140
They're just wings, buddy.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.700
Just wings?

02:17.800 --> 02:19.420
These wings might decide

02:19.520 --> 02:22.620
whether or not I get to go out
with the girl of my dreams.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.460
Everything has to be perfect!

02:24.560 --> 02:25.820
Mommy, I'm scared.

02:25.920 --> 02:27.260
Uh, sir,
if you can't decide,

02:27.360 --> 02:29.060
I'd recommend
the Big 50 Special.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.100
It's a bucket of 50
different kinds of wings,

02:31.200 --> 02:32.820
and it comes
with a liter of ranch.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.960
Yeah, that actually sounds
pretty good. I'll get that.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.040
( Cash register beeps )
You want those crispy
or crunchy?

02:36.920 --> 02:38.220
How crispy is "crispy"?

02:38.320 --> 02:39.620
( All groan )

02:50.840 --> 02:51.980
Got to get in there.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.740
These wings aren't getting
any warmer.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.020
Hmm.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.120
Bingo.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.660
Fellas!

02:59.760 --> 03:01.540
Mondays. Am I right?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.180
( Coughs )

03:03.280 --> 03:07.140
Anyways, got an important fax
from Langer. ( Sighs )

03:07.240 --> 03:09.940
Just gonna pop in and see
what the old boss man wants.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.780
Not until we frisk you,
sir.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.780
Guys, it's me.
Benson.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.220
Manager...
of the park...this park.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.540
Sorry, buddy.
It's regulation.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.340
Cool. Cool.
That's cool.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.500
( Inhales )

03:24.600 --> 03:26.600
âWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
âWhoa, whoa!

03:25.760 --> 03:27.380
( Grunts )
This is outrageous!

03:27.480 --> 03:29.500
Frisk me?
I should frisk you!

03:29.600 --> 03:31.980
This is my park!

03:32.080 --> 03:34.320
There's got to be
another way in here.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.600
Jackpot.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.580
( Grunts )

03:39.680 --> 03:40.620
Oh.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.860
I see your little game, Langer.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.420
However, I happen to know
that statistically,

03:45.520 --> 03:47.780
the most common pass code is

03:47.880 --> 03:52.760
one...two...three...four...
five.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.980
Uh...six?

03:56.080 --> 03:58.080
( Electricity crackles )

03:57.080 --> 03:58.820
Aah!
( Groans )

03:58.920 --> 04:01.900
So, it's a numbers game, is it?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.620
Let's play.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.720
One, one, one, one,
one, one, one!

04:04.840 --> 04:05.900
Aah!

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
One, one, one,
one, one, one, two!

04:07.120 --> 04:08.540
Aah! Geez!

04:08.640 --> 04:10.340
One, one, one, one,
one, one, three!

04:10.440 --> 04:12.580
( Groaning )

04:12.680 --> 04:13.860
This is crazy.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.500
Oh, Benson.
( Laughs )

04:16.600 --> 04:17.700
Have some dignity.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.220
Aah!

04:19.320 --> 04:22.280
( Electricity crackling )
( Screaming in distance )

04:23.160 --> 04:24.860
Aah!

04:24.960 --> 04:28.020
This is my park!
I should know the stupid code!

04:28.120 --> 04:30.120
What are you two
doing here?

04:29.320 --> 04:32.340
Shh.
Listen.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.340
Man, we should have just pounded
him and took those wings.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.780
Seriously.

04:36.880 --> 04:40.060
If I got to eat any more of that
lousy domeâitory food,

04:40.160 --> 04:42.160
someone's getting
a pounding!

04:41.400 --> 04:42.980
What the heck?

04:43.080 --> 04:45.420
The sound from the guard post
bounces off of the dome

04:45.520 --> 04:47.820
and back down
to this exact spot.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.740
It's science.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.280
I don't think you guys
should be wasting your time
eavesdropping on ââ

04:52.360 --> 04:54.360
âDelivery for Langer.
âTake it around back.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.540
What's that
pass code again?

04:55.640 --> 04:57.460
( Groans )
The code is "Langer."

04:57.560 --> 04:58.860
LâAâNâGâEâR.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.820
Got it?

04:59.920 --> 05:03.520
Nice work!
( Laughs )

05:04.520 --> 05:05.980
Haâha!

05:06.080 --> 05:08.080
Uh...

05:08.600 --> 05:10.100
Hmm.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.060
Wait, wait, wait.
Uhâoh.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.140
What the...?

05:13.240 --> 05:15.100
( Screaming )

05:15.200 --> 05:16.180
( Elevator dings )

05:16.280 --> 05:18.460
( Groans )

05:18.560 --> 05:19.780
What the heck is this place?

05:19.880 --> 05:23.400
( Whispering ) Pam?

05:24.440 --> 05:27.160
( Echoing ) Pam?

05:28.680 --> 05:30.340
( Thud )

05:30.440 --> 05:32.440
Pam?

05:33.120 --> 05:33.940
Hey, Pam.

05:34.040 --> 05:34.860
( Hissing )

05:34.960 --> 05:36.100
Aah! Aah!

05:36.200 --> 05:37.820
What would you do
if we actually

05:37.920 --> 05:39.660
caught someone
trespassing in here?

05:39.760 --> 05:42.100
( Chuckling ) Oh, man,
I'd give them a crazy beating.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.820
They'd be like,
"No, please, don't hurt me!"

05:44.920 --> 05:47.540
And I'd be like, "I have to.
It's my job."

05:47.640 --> 05:50.580
Whomp, whomp, whomp,
whomp, whomp!

05:54.080 --> 05:55.820
( Snoring )

05:55.920 --> 05:58.000
No way.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.680
It's Pam!
Room 309.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.420
( Electricity crackling )

06:05.520 --> 06:06.900
Pam!

06:07.000 --> 06:07.860
Whoa!

06:07.960 --> 06:09.300
Ohh!
( Thud )

06:09.400 --> 06:11.400
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

06:10.680 --> 06:13.100
I brought wings!

06:13.200 --> 06:15.700
( Gasps )
Oh, Benson! No way!

06:15.800 --> 06:17.100
( Door opens )

06:17.200 --> 06:18.820
Come on.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.820
The perfect spot
for a picnic.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.380
It sure is.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.900
Now, I wasn't sure
what kind of wings you liked,

06:26.000 --> 06:27.540
so I got a little bit
of everything.

06:27.640 --> 06:28.740
Mmm.

06:28.840 --> 06:31.340
First nonâdome food
in three weeks.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.460
Mmm!

06:32.560 --> 06:35.300
Oh, my gosh.
Mmm. This is amazing.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.700
Promise to sneak me a bucket
of these every day?

06:37.800 --> 06:39.300
Yes.
Yes, I will.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.540
( Both laugh )

06:40.640 --> 06:42.380
Oh.
I also got ranch.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.900
Uh, thanks,
but I'm really not a fan.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.100
Me, neither.
Get out of here, ranch.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.580
Nobody likes you, ranch.

06:48.680 --> 06:49.620
Go find a salad!

06:49.720 --> 06:50.820
( Both laugh )

06:52.560 --> 06:55.500
I don't care
if Monday's blue

06:55.600 --> 06:58.740
Tuesday's gray,
and Wednesday, too

06:58.840 --> 07:01.540
Thursday,
I don't care about you

07:01.640 --> 07:03.100
It's Friday

07:03.200 --> 07:05.140
I'm in love

07:05.240 --> 07:08.940
Monday you can fall apart

07:09.040 --> 07:11.820
Tuesday, Wednesday,
break my heart

07:11.920 --> 07:15.020
Oh,
Thursday doesn't even start

07:15.120 --> 07:16.580
It's Friday

07:16.680 --> 07:19.020
I'm in love

07:19.120 --> 07:22.500
Saturday, wait

07:22.600 --> 07:25.700
Sunday always comes too late

07:25.800 --> 07:29.300
But Friday never hesitate

07:29.400 --> 07:32.700
I don't care
if Monday's black

07:32.800 --> 07:36.060
Tuesday, Wednesday,
heart attack

07:36.160 --> 07:37.660
Thursday, never looking...

07:37.760 --> 07:39.740
Benson, this has been
the best lunch ever.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.900
Pam, there's something
I want to say.
( Clears throat )

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
What's that noise?
I was just clearing my throat.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.960
No, that noise.

07:47.760 --> 07:48.740
( Both scream )

07:48.840 --> 07:51.420
( Both panting )

07:51.520 --> 07:52.580
It's not working!

07:52.680 --> 07:53.780
Grab something!

07:53.880 --> 07:55.940
( Dramatic music plays )

07:56.040 --> 07:57.060
Bensoâoâoâoân!

07:57.160 --> 07:59.160
Pam!
Huh?

07:59.880 --> 08:01.140
Pam!

08:01.240 --> 08:02.500
( Panting )

08:02.600 --> 08:04.020
( Screams )

08:04.120 --> 08:05.820
( Grunting )

08:05.920 --> 08:09.380
Oh, Pam, I'm so sorry for
getting you into this mess.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.260
I just wanted to get you
some hot wings because ââ

08:12.360 --> 08:14.460
because I really wanted
to see you again.

08:14.560 --> 08:19.460
Oh, Benson, you know, my life
is just work, work, work.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.220
And even though
we're both about to die

08:21.320 --> 08:23.980
a horrific
and entirely preventable death,

08:24.080 --> 08:26.880
I'm really glad I got to spend
this time with you.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.500
( Burps )
Sorry.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.860
Sorry, I'm so...

08:32.960 --> 08:34.580
What?
The burp.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.100
Pam, you've got to burp.
( Burps )

08:37.200 --> 08:38.340
You've got to let 'er rip.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.460
( Burps loudly )

08:39.560 --> 08:41.060
Nice!

08:41.160 --> 08:42.260
It worked!

08:42.360 --> 08:44.100
( Both burping )

08:44.200 --> 08:46.580
( Burping )
Best lunch ever.

08:46.680 --> 08:47.820
( Burping )
Except the fan.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.100
( Laughs )

08:49.200 --> 08:50.660
Oh, my gosh.
That was crazy.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.780
Benson,
you beautiful genius.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.520
You did it.
You saved us.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.620
Yes, Benson, you're very smart.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.860
Langer!
Did you just see that?

09:02.960 --> 09:03.820
( Laughing ) Oh, no.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.220
Wait, I meant the other thing.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.620
You're very dumb!

09:08.720 --> 09:10.820
You didn't burp yourself
to safety!

09:10.920 --> 09:14.820
Your ranch turned on this
topâsecret antiâgravity machine!

09:14.920 --> 09:16.780
Look at this place!

09:16.880 --> 09:18.460
IâI'm sorry, sir.

09:18.560 --> 09:21.060
We were having lunch, and it ââ
it got out of hand.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.140
Lunch?

09:22.240 --> 09:23.500
Luââ Like a...date?

09:23.600 --> 09:27.100
Well, um...yeah,
like a date.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.980
You told me that you were
too busy to date.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.260
You know what?
Forget it.

09:31.360 --> 09:34.540
I'm issuing a new policy
effective immediately.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.780
There will be no dating
test subjects in this dome.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.900
Both of you, report to
the decontamination room now!

09:41.000 --> 09:43.620
( Screaming )
Hey, watch it.

09:43.720 --> 09:46.100
Not in the face!
( Screaming )

09:46.200 --> 09:48.300
( Sobbing )

09:48.400 --> 09:50.400
( Screaming )

09:54.400 --> 09:56.020
Pam:
I had a great time today.

09:56.120 --> 09:59.060
( Groans )
Me, too, memory of Pam.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.540
( Laughs )

10:00.640 --> 10:02.820
No, Benson, over here.

10:02.920 --> 10:04.500
Huh?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.580
Check your pocket.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.740
A wing.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.180
I snuck one out
for both of us.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.740
Ahh, no way.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.580
Pam, can we go out
when this is all over?

10:13.680 --> 10:16.600
( Chuckles )
Of course, Benson.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.340
( Laughs )

10:19.440 --> 10:21.960
( Both laughing )

10:27.440 --> 10:29.880
( Rigby and Mordecai laughing )

10:31.880 --> 10:33.880
Get back to work!
