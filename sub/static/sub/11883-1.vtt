00:23.707 --> 00:26.206
AMANDA: This is Grinnell, Iowa, my hometown.

00:26.207 --> 00:28.372
Where my family
and all of my friends live.

00:28.373 --> 00:29.664
( mooing )

00:29.665 --> 00:30.997
But I'm not there now.

00:30.998 --> 00:33.914
I'm here, New York City.

00:33.915 --> 00:37.623
Home to eight million people,
roughly half of whom are men.

00:37.624 --> 00:42.331
Which means half of the city is genetically
predisposed to lie to the other half.

00:42.332 --> 00:45.915
You see, I'm the woman who has the
world's worst judgment in men.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.748
I know what you're thinking.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.372
You might think that you do.

00:50.373 --> 00:51.914
But you don't.

00:51.915 --> 00:54.122
I do.

00:54.123 --> 00:57.664
My grade school boyfriend,
Tommy, left me for...

00:57.665 --> 00:59.581
Someone with boobs.

00:59.582 --> 01:02.623
My high school boyfriend,
Charlie, left me for...

01:02.624 --> 01:04.955
Well, someone who
didn't have any boobs.

01:04.956 --> 01:08.914
Amanda, this isn't what it looks like.

01:08.915 --> 01:10.830
AMANDA: But that's all behind me now.

01:10.831 --> 01:14.914
I have a great job restoring paintings
at the Metropolitan museum.

01:14.915 --> 01:18.956
I'm in the Renaissance Art division,
where the men are easier to deal with.

01:21.624 --> 01:22.956
There you are, handsome.

01:26.956 --> 01:31.122
All right, so there's this new hottie,
Paulina, upstairs in 20th century sculpture.

01:31.123 --> 01:34.955
She is so sweet. And I swear, I'm going
to be getting all up and there and I...

01:34.956 --> 01:38.289
Lisa, you are crossing
the sharing boundary again.

01:38.290 --> 01:41.247
But seriously, we have
to put in for transfers.

01:41.248 --> 01:42.914
Renaissance is a dead end.

01:42.915 --> 01:45.830
We're going to end up like the
menopause triplets over there.

01:45.831 --> 01:48.122
What? Hmm?

01:48.123 --> 01:50.122
I don't think I could
ever leave Renaissance.

01:50.123 --> 01:52.623
I mean, I'd miss these
paintings way too much.

01:52.624 --> 01:54.664
I mean, they're just
so romantic...

01:54.665 --> 01:56.872
Shit! Here comes old man,
Rankin. Look busy.

01:56.873 --> 01:58.122
( grunts )

01:58.123 --> 01:59.997
I am busy.
Well, help me look busy.

01:59.998 --> 02:01.122
Good afternoon, ladies.

02:01.123 --> 02:02.748
Nice tie.
Hi.

02:02.749 --> 02:04.664
When do we go to the Poconos again?

02:04.665 --> 02:06.831
Amanda, I need your help.

02:08.707 --> 02:10.830
Take a look at this piece of crap.

02:13.915 --> 02:15.830
Oh, my god. It's...

02:15.831 --> 02:17.706
That's Titian's "The Bacchanal".

02:17.707 --> 02:19.164
( gasps )

02:19.165 --> 02:21.331
POLLY: There she goes again.

02:21.332 --> 02:23.872
Look at this man's face here.
It's completely lost.

02:23.873 --> 02:26.331
You're going to have to start
from scratch on that.

02:26.332 --> 02:27.955
Put aside your other work, Amanda.

02:27.956 --> 02:30.039
This is priority number one for now.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.289
Oh!

02:31.290 --> 02:32.789
( humming )

02:32.790 --> 02:35.581
What's with you and this
weak-in-the-knees routine?

02:35.582 --> 02:37.707
You do it every time
you get a new painting.

02:39.373 --> 02:41.664
I do not.
Not every time.

02:41.665 --> 02:43.623
I mean when I look at this painting,

02:43.624 --> 02:46.247
I can just tell that these
people were in love.

02:46.248 --> 02:48.830
And they stayed in love
until the day that they died.

02:48.831 --> 02:50.706
( chuckles )
Amanda, it's a painting.

02:50.707 --> 02:52.664
If this were real life, in two years,

02:52.665 --> 02:53.997
that girl would be pregnant,

02:53.998 --> 02:56.289
and that guy'd be out banging a barmaid.

02:56.290 --> 03:00.039
Maybe that's why I like art
better than real life.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.789
They can stay in love forever.

03:01.790 --> 03:05.373
Speaking of real life, aren't you suppose
to have one tonight for a change?

03:07.332 --> 03:10.539
Oh, shit! That's right. I was going
to surprise Michael with dinner.

03:10.540 --> 03:11.873
( laughing )

03:13.540 --> 03:14.997
What's so funny?

03:14.998 --> 03:18.247
Nothing. Just that you
are going to die alone.

03:18.248 --> 03:19.706
What?

03:19.707 --> 03:21.748
She's going to die alone.

03:21.749 --> 03:24.247
Oh.

03:24.248 --> 03:27.748
Seriously, why do I need a personal
life if my work makes me happy?

03:27.749 --> 03:29.748
Because work isn't enough.

03:29.749 --> 03:32.206
You need someone
to share your life with.

03:32.207 --> 03:34.414
And if you give up on that now,

03:34.415 --> 03:37.581
it might not be so easy to find later.

03:37.582 --> 03:40.414
Polly, could I see you in my office?

03:40.415 --> 03:43.582
I need to have a look
at the restoration reports.

03:44.790 --> 03:45.915
( humming )

03:49.040 --> 03:51.748
Oh, god. Do you think
that could be me one day?

03:51.749 --> 03:55.080
No, if it got that bad, I'd shoot
you and put you out of your misery.

03:55.081 --> 03:57.915
Right. I think I'd better
go and see Michael.

04:06.248 --> 04:07.665
Michael?

04:08.790 --> 04:11.122
Oh, shit.

04:11.123 --> 04:15.830
Ah, Amanda, this isn't
what it looks like.

04:15.831 --> 04:18.872
Huh, it looks like you're having sex

04:18.873 --> 04:21.457
with the woman from the cover
of the lingerie catalog.

04:22.415 --> 04:24.164
In our bed.

04:24.165 --> 04:25.290
Uh...

04:33.415 --> 04:36.289
Amanda, you know what your problem is?

04:36.290 --> 04:40.122
You think everybody is basically good
and you fall for them right away.

04:40.123 --> 04:42.122
There are four million
men in New York.

04:42.123 --> 04:44.331
Why can't I find just one
good one? Just one.

04:44.332 --> 04:45.830
Just one. You know, just one.

04:45.831 --> 04:48.872
Remember when you saw the Titian
and got weak in the knees?

04:48.873 --> 04:51.789
Have you ever felt
that way about a guy?

04:51.790 --> 04:53.289
( chuckling )

04:53.290 --> 04:55.289
Lisa.

04:55.290 --> 04:58.289
Please, real women don't get
weak in the knees over some guy.

04:58.290 --> 05:01.331
Yeah, most women don't get weak
in the knees over a painting.

05:01.332 --> 05:02.997
( laughs )

05:02.998 --> 05:04.872
I understand paintings.

05:04.873 --> 05:06.830
I know what I feel
for them is real.

05:06.831 --> 05:09.789
Men, they're complicated, you know?

05:09.790 --> 05:13.206
What I need to do right now is just
focus on work and forget about men.

05:13.207 --> 05:15.831
I think that's the smartest
thing you've said all night.

05:21.165 --> 05:22.499
Is this okay?

05:25.123 --> 05:27.707
I think I'll start looking
for a place this Saturday.

05:28.831 --> 05:30.372
Mmm.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.789
Or tomorrow.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.873
( upbeat music playing )

06:02.040 --> 06:04.039
( snoring )

06:04.040 --> 06:06.915
Hi. I'm going up to apartment nine.

06:09.248 --> 06:10.872
Hello?

06:10.873 --> 06:13.039
( bell dings )

06:13.040 --> 06:14.372
( barks )

06:14.373 --> 06:15.415
( grunts )

06:20.081 --> 06:21.206
JIM: Hamlet, no.

06:21.207 --> 06:22.706
( screams )

06:22.707 --> 06:23.789
Get off me.

06:23.790 --> 06:25.790
Get off of her.
Come on, bad dog.

06:26.956 --> 06:28.498
Are you okay?

06:28.499 --> 06:31.039
( chuckles )
I guess he likes you.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.081
Huh?

06:33.123 --> 06:34.664
Whoa.

06:34.665 --> 06:37.581
Hey, I think you might
still be a little shaken up.

06:37.582 --> 06:41.248
No, no, I'm fine.
I just got weak knees.

06:46.123 --> 06:49.664
You know, you should really
learn to control yourself.

06:49.665 --> 06:51.664
I, I mean, control your dog.

06:51.665 --> 06:54.581
Oh, he's not my dog.
I walk him for my neighbor.

06:54.582 --> 06:55.872
She had her hip replaced.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.790
Right, that's what you say
to avoid a lawsuit.

07:00.956 --> 07:03.789
Come on, Hamlet,
no means no, dude.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.623
I am so sorry.

07:05.624 --> 07:07.789
He's a horny bastard, isn't he?

07:07.790 --> 07:10.206
Well, I wouldn't know,
I just met him.

07:10.207 --> 07:12.331
I was talking about the dog.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.955
I, I know.
I know that.

07:13.956 --> 07:18.080
Ah, can I get you anything?
Like a Kleenex or a cigarette?

07:18.081 --> 07:20.456
No, I'm fine, really.

07:20.457 --> 07:23.872
Look, it was nice to meet you
and your huge dong.

07:23.873 --> 07:25.623
I mean, his huge dong.

07:25.624 --> 07:28.414
I've seen way bigger than that.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.707
I mean, his huge dick.

07:31.998 --> 07:35.706
Dog! Huge dog!
Right, okay. Got to go.

07:35.707 --> 07:38.247
It was nice meeting you, too.

07:38.248 --> 07:42.331
Oh, Hamlet, great dane.

07:42.332 --> 07:43.789
I get it.

07:43.790 --> 07:46.164
That's clever for a dog name.

07:46.165 --> 07:48.498
Yeah, I thought so, too.

07:48.499 --> 07:49.706
( glass shattering )

07:49.707 --> 07:52.540
Oh, my god.
I got to go. Bye.

07:54.790 --> 07:56.165
Come on in.

07:59.665 --> 08:02.332
Wow. This place is amazing.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.331
Holly Payton.
Uh, Amanda Pierce.

08:06.332 --> 08:10.540
The rent's 500 dollars. You can pay
cash, check, money order, cash.

08:11.915 --> 08:13.207
Can I see the room first?

08:14.540 --> 08:17.080
Ta-da! Here it is.

08:17.081 --> 08:18.373
Oh.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.706
It looks like a closet.

08:21.707 --> 08:24.581
( chuckles )
Oh, closets don't have windows.

08:24.582 --> 08:28.873
Besides, this is the closet.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.414
Wow!

08:34.414 --> 08:37.206
I mean, how much room
do you need to sleep?

08:37.207 --> 08:39.373
But shoes, they need their space.

08:42.873 --> 08:46.539
Now, we have a lot of people interested.
So, what is it that you do?

08:46.540 --> 08:48.997
Oh, I work over at...
You work?

08:48.998 --> 08:50.372
I like you.

08:50.373 --> 08:52.914
Did I mention you're in
the lead for the apartment?

08:52.915 --> 08:54.456
Hi.

08:54.457 --> 08:55.706
Oh, you're back.

08:55.707 --> 08:56.624
Oh!

08:56.625 --> 08:58.581
This is Amanda, she works.

08:58.582 --> 09:01.372
Amanda, this is Roxana Milos...

09:01.373 --> 09:02.955
Miloslavzniakova.

09:02.956 --> 09:04.706
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

09:04.707 --> 09:07.206
You know what's nice? Paying the rent.
That's what is nice.

09:07.207 --> 09:08.706
Shut up.

09:08.707 --> 09:11.247
Good day, I'm Candi, with an "I".

09:11.248 --> 09:12.456
Amanda.

09:12.457 --> 09:14.914
I had a pet dingo named Amanda once.

09:14.915 --> 09:16.164
Pet dingo?

09:16.165 --> 09:18.247
Yeah, but me dad backed over with a tractor.

09:18.248 --> 09:19.581
( laughs )

09:19.582 --> 09:21.498
I was finding pieces of her all summer.

09:21.499 --> 09:24.080
In tops of trees, my little sister's hair.

09:24.081 --> 09:26.623
Thank you, Candi.
This is Jade.

09:26.624 --> 09:28.122
Oh, god, Not the ring.

09:28.123 --> 09:30.748
Wow, that's an incredible
diamond. Are you engaged?

09:30.749 --> 09:34.331
No. It would take a lot
more carats than this.

09:34.332 --> 09:36.955
You're not a smoker-girl, are you?

09:36.956 --> 09:38.122
No.

09:38.123 --> 09:40.247
That's how we all got put together.

09:40.248 --> 09:42.623
We are the last four
non-smoking models

09:42.624 --> 09:44.457
on the whole island
of Manhattan.

09:46.915 --> 09:48.830
Oh, my god.
You're all models.

09:48.831 --> 09:50.122
Yeah.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.456
Oh, don't envy us.
We're struggling.

09:52.457 --> 09:53.789
In this apartment?

09:53.790 --> 09:55.830
Our agency lets us
stay here for free.

09:55.831 --> 09:59.664
We like to rent the extra closet...
Room for spending money.

09:59.665 --> 10:01.830
Oh, yeah.

10:01.831 --> 10:04.789
I don't think she likes them the models.

10:04.790 --> 10:07.290
No, my boyfriend just
left me for a model.

10:09.582 --> 10:11.247
It's not any of you.

10:11.248 --> 10:14.664
( chuckles ) I'm glad we don't
have to go through that one again.

10:14.665 --> 10:16.331
Then we'll get along fine.

10:16.332 --> 10:17.332
No problem.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.164
Welcome.

10:19.165 --> 10:20.207
( nervous laughter )

10:29.332 --> 10:30.499
I love you.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.831
That was good English, Dieter.

10:39.499 --> 10:41.830
( upbeat music playing )

10:41.831 --> 10:44.164
Hey, Mandy.
You want a blouse?

10:44.165 --> 10:45.831
Oh, no, okay.

10:50.873 --> 10:52.456
Phooey.

10:52.457 --> 10:54.664
This shirt makes me
look like heroin addict.

10:54.665 --> 10:57.955
And not in a good way.
Oh, here.

10:57.956 --> 11:01.331
Take mine. I wore it
once before anyway.

11:01.332 --> 11:02.914
What are you going to wear?

11:02.915 --> 11:03.873
I'll just take hers.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.206
Say what?

11:06.207 --> 11:08.372
She wants to try your top. Give it.

11:08.373 --> 11:09.415
What's going on here?

11:11.956 --> 11:15.997
Hey, did you know there are two guys
just waiting in the hall for you?

11:15.998 --> 11:17.372
Only two?

11:17.373 --> 11:20.581
The longer we wait, the
more money they'll spend.

11:20.582 --> 11:21.707
On dinner.

11:23.207 --> 11:24.623
( clamoring )

11:24.624 --> 11:26.707
Okay, let's back it up, boys.

11:28.707 --> 11:30.706
See if there's anything
you like, Amanda.

11:30.707 --> 11:34.164
Oh, no, no. I'm not really
interested in men right now.

11:34.165 --> 11:36.539
Oh, but they seem
like great guys.

11:36.540 --> 11:39.706
Yeah, they all seem like great guys
when they know you're watching.

11:39.707 --> 11:42.247
But you got to look past
what they want you to see.

11:42.248 --> 11:43.248
Huh.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.456
That guy right there,

11:47.457 --> 11:49.748
suit's Hugo Boss, but it's
straight off the rack.

11:49.749 --> 11:52.372
The tie's a Gucci knockoff.
And those shoes...

11:52.373 --> 11:53.914
( chuckles )

11:53.915 --> 11:56.581
Girl, that's between
him and Payless.

11:56.582 --> 11:57.789
But check this guy.

11:57.790 --> 11:59.247
See that bulge in his pants?

11:59.248 --> 12:01.872
That's either a necklace
box from Tiffany's or...

12:01.873 --> 12:03.997
Oh, hell, I'd take
him either way.

12:03.998 --> 12:07.997
So, you pick relationships
based on clothing and gifts?

12:07.998 --> 12:09.955
No, we pick them
based on personality.

12:09.956 --> 12:11.623
( laughing )

12:11.624 --> 12:13.206
Now pick guy so we can go.

12:13.207 --> 12:16.414
Oh, I don't think I can afford
to go out with you guys.

12:16.415 --> 12:19.122
Actually, I know that I can't.

12:19.123 --> 12:21.790
We don't pay.
We're models.

12:23.290 --> 12:25.623
What does someone like you do?

12:25.624 --> 12:29.289
I'm a paintings conservator at the
Met specializing in Renaissance Art.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.289
ALL: Oh.

12:31.290 --> 12:34.122
Right now I'm restoring this one
painting, Titian's "Bacchanal".

12:34.123 --> 12:35.414
Yeah.

12:35.415 --> 12:38.206
And one of the faces is blank
and there's absolutely

12:38.207 --> 12:40.331
no historical record
of what it looked like,

12:40.332 --> 12:42.289
so it's kind of up to me
to complete it.

12:42.290 --> 12:44.956
Yeah, we should definitely
talk more about that later.

12:55.332 --> 12:56.664
Hi, Candi with an "I."

12:56.665 --> 12:58.457
( mumbling ) Oh, hi, Mandy.

13:00.248 --> 13:01.789
Facial-flex?

13:01.790 --> 13:03.955
Oh, no, no.
I'm good. Thanks.

13:03.956 --> 13:05.830
Wow.

13:05.831 --> 13:08.331
You have a really symmetrical nose.

13:08.332 --> 13:10.664
Thank you.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.539
So, why aren't you
going out with them?

13:12.540 --> 13:14.830
Oh, I can't go out in public yet.

13:14.831 --> 13:17.331
The agency made me
get an operation.

13:17.332 --> 13:20.372
My earlobes were uneven.

13:20.373 --> 13:25.080
You know, Candi, some of the really great
faces aren't necessarily symmetrical.

13:25.081 --> 13:28.456
Yeah, the beauty's
often in the flaws.

13:28.457 --> 13:30.665
You're an odd bird.
You know that?

13:32.998 --> 13:34.372
Wow!

13:34.373 --> 13:36.122
We have quite a view here.

13:36.123 --> 13:37.332
Yeah.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.289
No way.

13:41.290 --> 13:42.372
What?

13:42.373 --> 13:43.623
It's him.

13:43.624 --> 13:44.664
It's who?

13:44.665 --> 13:45.872
That guy that...

13:45.873 --> 13:47.539
Mr. Fishtank?

13:47.540 --> 13:49.581
Oh, his name's Jim Winston.

13:49.582 --> 13:52.039
But his head doesn't
normally look that big.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.164
It's the water that
makes it look that way.

13:54.165 --> 13:55.456
How do you know?

13:55.457 --> 13:57.414
Oh, I know a lot about water.

13:57.415 --> 13:59.414
Australia's an island, you know?

13:59.415 --> 14:01.039
( chuckles )

14:01.040 --> 14:03.748
I mean, how do you know
his name is Jim Winston?

14:03.749 --> 14:07.080
Oh, he's a fashion executive.

14:07.081 --> 14:10.539
The girls tell me he's the hottest
young guy in the business.

14:10.540 --> 14:12.539
So, you want him, eh?

14:12.540 --> 14:13.623
Why do you say that?

14:13.624 --> 14:15.539
That look on your face.

14:15.540 --> 14:19.081
I used to see it all the time when I'd
catch me uncle Pete looking at me.

14:23.749 --> 14:25.164
There's, there's no look.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.498
I was just shocked because
I recognized someone.

14:27.499 --> 14:29.664
Besides, I never go out
with guys like that.

14:29.665 --> 14:31.789
Even if I were going out,
which I am not, so.

14:31.790 --> 14:33.789
You want me to find out
where he works?

14:33.790 --> 14:36.915
No. I just told you, I don't
care If I ever see him again.

14:38.415 --> 14:40.415
Hamlet, get off her.

14:41.457 --> 14:43.582
( chuckling ) It's you.

14:44.624 --> 14:46.748
Again.

14:46.749 --> 14:49.164
Hamlet definitely seems to like you.

14:49.165 --> 14:51.164
You mean, he doesn't
just tackle anybody?

14:51.165 --> 14:52.914
No, he tackles everybody.

14:52.915 --> 14:54.914
But he only drools on his favorites.

14:54.915 --> 14:56.081
Well, I'm flattered.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.080
( chuckles )

15:01.081 --> 15:02.415
You're funny.

15:03.582 --> 15:05.164
Oh.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.955
You should have someone
take a look at those knees.

15:07.956 --> 15:09.955
You know, they've
never done this before.

15:09.956 --> 15:11.955
I'm going to have
to see a psychiatrist.

15:11.956 --> 15:14.789
I mean a leg doctor. Because
it's obviously a leg problem.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.456
At least let me buy
you another latte.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.039
Oh, no thanks, Jim.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.624
How do you know my name?

15:21.415 --> 15:23.664
I don't remember Introducing myself.

15:23.665 --> 15:26.498
Ah, but you did, Jim. Remember?

15:26.499 --> 15:29.289
I'm Amanda, And that's Hamlet.

15:29.290 --> 15:31.122
Jim, Amanda, Hamlet.

15:31.123 --> 15:34.331
I think I'd remember a
beautiful name like Amanda.

15:34.332 --> 15:35.664
But you didn't.

15:35.665 --> 15:37.289
Anyway, sorry.

15:37.290 --> 15:39.955
I can't go out with you. For coffee.

15:39.956 --> 15:41.748
I, I didn't mean go out with you.

15:41.749 --> 15:43.289
Just go out with you for coffee.
( laughs )

15:43.290 --> 15:44.955
Not even to replace this one, which I can't.

15:44.956 --> 15:47.748
I've got the runs,
I mean, I got to run.

15:47.749 --> 15:48.790
Okay, got to go.

15:52.831 --> 15:56.499
( breathing heavily )
Oh, my god.
"I've got the runs"?

15:59.373 --> 16:00.830
( laughs )

16:00.831 --> 16:03.498
So, girl why didn't you
have coffee with him?

16:03.499 --> 16:05.664
Because that's what
I'd normally do.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.498
What?
I would have coffee with him.

16:07.499 --> 16:11.414
I'd move in and find myself
alone on a beach in Waikiki,

16:11.415 --> 16:15.122
while he's off with the slut that
runs the pearl-diving concession.

16:15.123 --> 16:16.207
Oh, yeah, it happened.

16:18.165 --> 16:19.332
Is that the new CK girl?

16:20.831 --> 16:21.997
Uh-huh.

16:21.998 --> 16:23.498
She's cute.

16:23.499 --> 16:27.372
You know, I heard they gave
her 11 million dollars.

16:27.373 --> 16:29.539
She, she looks 14 though.

16:29.540 --> 16:30.664
Hello.

16:30.665 --> 16:31.873
BOTH: She's 12.

16:35.707 --> 16:37.997
Question. If these guys
are your dates,

16:37.998 --> 16:40.039
why do you make them
stand over there?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.498
( laughing )

16:41.499 --> 16:44.206
Have you ever spent an entire
evening with one of these guys?

16:44.207 --> 16:47.872
It's all "you're beautiful In that dress",
"you look beautiful in this light".

16:47.873 --> 16:50.039
"Marry me and be the queen
of my country."

16:50.040 --> 16:53.039
So Holly worked out The "you sit
over there" system. It works.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.456
You know, she turned down
a full ride at Stanford.

16:55.457 --> 16:57.039
Really? Why did you do that?

16:57.040 --> 17:00.373
Sweetheart, look at me. What
do I need Stanford for?

17:03.831 --> 17:05.872
It's 120 dollars... I don't...

17:05.873 --> 17:07.039
It's 1,200 dollars.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.498
1,200 dollars?

17:08.499 --> 17:10.372
Relax.

17:10.373 --> 17:11.954
( clamoring )

17:11.955 --> 17:14.954
Ladies, may I have the honor
of taking you to dinner?

17:14.955 --> 17:17.872
Thank you. That's so sweet.

17:17.873 --> 17:18.915
It's nothing.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.415
( chuckling )

17:35.707 --> 17:38.539
CANDI: If you're so
not interested in him,

17:38.540 --> 17:40.414
then why are you watching him?

17:40.415 --> 17:42.122
I'm not.

17:42.123 --> 17:45.748
Well, I am, but only to prove to
you that he has some huge flaw.

17:45.749 --> 17:47.456
How do you know that?

17:47.457 --> 17:49.248
Because I'm attracted to him.

17:50.790 --> 17:53.039
What a cute, little bunny, look.

17:53.040 --> 17:56.498
AMANDA: Okay, there's the flaw.
He has a love child.

17:56.499 --> 17:58.623
Well, who's that woman
that just walked in?

17:58.624 --> 18:01.456
AMANDA: You can't have
a love child without a lover.

18:01.457 --> 18:04.331
And that scumbag
invited me out for coffee.

18:04.332 --> 18:06.623
Then how do you explain
the husband looking guy

18:06.624 --> 18:08.997
with the baby pouch
strapped to his chest?

18:08.998 --> 18:12.581
A little menage-a-trois action.

18:12.582 --> 18:14.955
I bet they don't even know
which one the father is.

18:14.956 --> 18:16.331
Ew.

18:16.332 --> 18:19.789
Oh, schoolgirls.
That's sweet.

18:19.790 --> 18:21.706
AMANDA: Yeah, it seems sweet.

18:21.707 --> 18:25.414
Unfortunately, what we're about to find out
is that they're under-aged prostitutes,

18:25.415 --> 18:26.748
dressed as catholic girls.

18:26.749 --> 18:28.581
See that?
He's giving them money.

18:28.582 --> 18:31.624
I think the money is probably for
all the candy bars he's buying.

18:33.665 --> 18:36.372
Those little whores are good.

18:36.373 --> 18:38.456
They even bring the props.

18:38.457 --> 18:40.331
( chuckles ) Twenty-one.

18:40.332 --> 18:41.706
( cheering )

18:41.707 --> 18:43.165
Twenty-two.

18:44.831 --> 18:46.831
Twenty-three.

18:47.956 --> 18:50.289
Twenty-four.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.499
Oh, twenty-five.

18:54.165 --> 18:56.289
Twenty-six.

18:56.290 --> 18:58.289
Oh...

18:58.290 --> 19:01.331
Now, I am looking
very hard, okay,

19:01.332 --> 19:03.039
and I can't see any flaws.

19:03.040 --> 19:06.414
He's like Mr. Perfect.

19:06.415 --> 19:09.164
A little too perfect, maybe?

19:09.165 --> 19:11.289
Gay perfect?

19:11.290 --> 19:12.664
He wears boxers,

19:12.665 --> 19:15.247
and there are no framed
portraits of his mother.

19:15.248 --> 19:18.039
Trust me, that man is not gay.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.207
( clicks )

19:22.457 --> 19:26.289
Now, I can't decide whether he looks
better with his clothes on or off.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.039
These are great pictures, Jade.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.206
I know.

19:29.207 --> 19:31.373
CANDI: Let me see,
let me see. Oh.

19:32.873 --> 19:35.748
Candi, your eyes,
your whole face is beautiful.

19:35.749 --> 19:37.872
Why do they keep making
you get work done?

19:37.873 --> 19:39.872
Bulk discount.

19:39.873 --> 19:41.706
Look, Amanda, he's having a party.

19:41.707 --> 19:44.706
It's the best time for you to
go over there and talk to him.

19:44.707 --> 19:45.914
Except I'm not invited.

19:45.915 --> 19:47.748
So what? We crash.

19:47.749 --> 19:49.914
That's a really great way
to talk to someone,

19:49.915 --> 19:51.914
getting turned away
from his party.

19:51.915 --> 19:54.039
Who would keep models
away from a party?

19:54.040 --> 19:56.539
Hello, every man
down there will be saying,

19:56.540 --> 19:59.080
"I wish more models would
show up at this damn party".

19:59.081 --> 20:00.289
No. Thanks anyway.

20:00.290 --> 20:02.539
Stop the pose.
You know you're into him.

20:02.540 --> 20:03.457
I am not.

20:03.458 --> 20:05.248
Ah, excuse me?

20:06.873 --> 20:07.915
Busted.

20:12.707 --> 20:17.080
So? He just happens to have a
renaissance structure to his face.

20:17.081 --> 20:18.247
Mmm-hmm.

20:18.248 --> 20:19.706
I mean, what's the point?

20:19.707 --> 20:22.872
He's in the fashion business.
He probably only dates,

20:22.873 --> 20:24.581
you know?

20:24.582 --> 20:26.414
Promiscuous women?

20:26.415 --> 20:28.581
No. Models.

20:28.582 --> 20:31.248
Fine. If you think he wants a model,

20:32.540 --> 20:33.915
we will give him a model.

20:35.081 --> 20:36.789
Oh, no.

21:17.373 --> 21:18.955
You can wear it, honey.

21:18.956 --> 21:20.831
I'm just not sure how
long you'll keep it on.

21:25.332 --> 21:26.997
Okay, remember, when you walk in,

21:26.998 --> 21:29.164
you're the most beautiful
woman in the room.

21:29.165 --> 21:30.664
Well, you're in the top four.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.873
True. And oh, keep
your cheeks clenched.

21:34.499 --> 21:38.080
Not those. These.

21:38.081 --> 21:39.498
Oh, and the most important,

21:39.499 --> 21:41.665
Don't forget to turn on the headlights.

21:47.665 --> 21:49.499
( upbeat music playing )

22:04.165 --> 22:05.997
MAN: Okay. All right.

22:05.998 --> 22:08.207
( speaking indistinctly )

22:12.873 --> 22:16.872
MAN: Hey, Jimmy, a piece of
heaven fell into my office today.

22:16.873 --> 22:18.039
I swear to god.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.830
And she signed with you, Nick.

22:19.831 --> 22:21.707
When does she get
the third eye removed?

22:22.915 --> 22:25.872
Ladies! Ladies!

22:25.873 --> 22:29.206
Ladies, the first glass was free,

22:29.207 --> 22:31.372
but this one is going to cost you.

22:31.373 --> 22:33.539
( laughs )

22:33.540 --> 22:34.707
My god.

22:37.707 --> 22:39.873
Hey, Ivan.

22:42.373 --> 22:44.080
Hey, Jimmy.

22:44.081 --> 22:47.164
Just got some new samples in.
Wanna open now or later?

22:47.165 --> 22:49.914
I will take her now.

22:49.915 --> 22:51.748
And her later.

22:51.749 --> 22:52.914
( barking )

22:52.915 --> 22:54.248
( girls giggling )

22:59.123 --> 23:00.206
GIRL: Bernie.

23:00.207 --> 23:01.914
Megan...

23:01.915 --> 23:05.122
Just 'cause we work together,
don't mean we can't, you know.

23:05.123 --> 23:06.915
I mean, why do you have to act all...

23:09.582 --> 23:11.206
Hey, Jade.
Yeah?

23:11.207 --> 23:12.414
I'll see you.

23:12.415 --> 23:13.664
Where are you going?

23:13.665 --> 23:15.582
I think I was wrong about Jim. I'm out.

23:18.081 --> 23:21.789
So, what was that you
were saying about me?

23:21.790 --> 23:23.789
( elevator bell dings )

23:23.790 --> 23:25.248
Hold it, wait.

23:40.956 --> 23:42.289
Amanda?

23:42.290 --> 23:43.914
Jim!

23:43.915 --> 23:45.955
( grunts )

23:45.956 --> 23:47.123
Ow.

23:49.956 --> 23:50.956
Oh, hi.

23:52.873 --> 23:55.956
I, I didn't recognize you
without your big, drooling dog.

23:57.165 --> 23:59.748
I barely recognize you.

23:59.749 --> 24:03.247
I live with models. I was
their science project tonight.

24:03.248 --> 24:05.539
So, you're a model?

24:05.540 --> 24:08.290
Oh, yeah. Supermodel.

24:10.165 --> 24:12.665
I mean to say that
I hope you're not a model.

24:15.290 --> 24:18.372
You're not like most of the
women I see at these parties.

24:18.373 --> 24:19.664
What is it you do?

24:19.665 --> 24:21.498
I restore paintings at the Met.

24:21.499 --> 24:22.997
Really?
Yeah.

24:22.998 --> 24:24.581
That's why I'm leaving.

24:24.582 --> 24:26.165
I wish I could leave.

24:27.499 --> 24:29.830
Why? You seem like you
were having a great time.

24:29.831 --> 24:32.206
Oh.

24:32.207 --> 24:36.039
My job basically consists of kissing
ass and smiling while I do it.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.331
Oh.

24:37.332 --> 24:39.748
But it's not really me.

24:39.749 --> 24:43.831
So, the split personality emerges.
You're really two different people.

24:45.499 --> 24:47.499
You could look at it that way.

24:51.499 --> 24:53.955
We'd both like to talk to you.

24:53.956 --> 24:56.872
Well, I don't want to keep
you two from your party.

24:56.873 --> 24:59.873
Hey, as far as we're
concerned, you are the party.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.664
All right!

25:09.665 --> 25:10.873
( laughs )

25:12.665 --> 25:16.372
But why did she leave you?
You're practically perfect.

25:16.373 --> 25:18.873
I mean, it sounds like you
two were a great couple.

25:20.707 --> 25:22.539
You know what my problem is?

25:22.540 --> 25:24.706
I think everybody's basically good.

25:24.707 --> 25:26.498
Then I fall for them right away.

25:26.499 --> 25:28.706
And then I get disappointed.

25:28.707 --> 25:29.707
Hmm.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.540
I know exactly what you mean.

25:35.415 --> 25:37.582
Not saying that I was
ever the best boyfriend.

25:38.873 --> 25:41.289
My work kept me away
for long hours.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.706
She thought it was dangerous.

25:43.707 --> 25:46.539
She thought the fashion
business was dangerous?

25:46.540 --> 25:49.498
Dangerous, to my health.

25:49.499 --> 25:52.080
You know, stressful.

25:52.081 --> 25:54.955
Well, I'd hate to see
anything happen to you.

25:54.956 --> 25:57.248
And I only just met you.

26:01.915 --> 26:03.247
MAN: There you are.

26:03.248 --> 26:05.414
Jim. Come back to the party, man.

26:05.415 --> 26:07.247
There's somebody I want you to meet.

26:07.248 --> 26:09.247
Great. Was the chairman able to make it?

26:09.248 --> 26:10.581
Oh, no.
Not the chairman.

26:10.582 --> 26:12.414
Some VIPs from Antwerp.

26:12.415 --> 26:13.790
Okay, okay.
Hold on a second.

26:16.624 --> 26:18.789
Remember that ass I hate kissing?

26:18.790 --> 26:21.414
Well, this is Belgian ass.
The worst.

26:21.415 --> 26:25.914
Well, I wouldn't know.
But I'll take your word for it.

26:25.915 --> 26:29.456
Hey, maybe we could meet
on purpose next time.

26:29.457 --> 26:30.790
A date?

26:32.248 --> 26:33.290
Yeah.

26:34.956 --> 26:38.831
You know, actually, my schedule's
pretty crazy the next few weeks.

26:40.624 --> 26:43.789
Ah, yeah, me too. I have this
big project at the museum,

26:43.790 --> 26:45.332
And Mr. Rankin...

26:46.415 --> 26:47.748
Good night, Jim.

26:47.749 --> 26:48.831
Good night.

26:51.290 --> 26:52.623
Amanda?

26:52.624 --> 26:53.624
Huh?

26:54.831 --> 26:56.122
My jacket.

26:56.123 --> 26:57.373
Oh.

27:00.665 --> 27:02.206
Thanks.

27:02.207 --> 27:03.665
MAN: Jim, come on.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.872
Forget about that one.
This party's swarming.

27:07.873 --> 27:08.831
Come on.

27:32.290 --> 27:33.540
Amanda!

27:39.165 --> 27:41.164
( panting )

27:41.165 --> 27:42.707
I...

27:43.998 --> 27:46.039
Want to...

27:46.040 --> 27:47.373
Go out with you.

27:48.707 --> 27:50.372
Asthma?

27:50.373 --> 27:52.206
Only when I'm under stress.

27:52.207 --> 27:53.373
Look...

27:54.665 --> 27:56.247
I usually hide in my work.

27:56.248 --> 27:58.414
I mean, behind my work,

27:58.415 --> 27:59.914
so I don't hurt anyone.

27:59.915 --> 28:02.706
I mean, get hurt.

28:02.707 --> 28:04.789
I think we're both alike.

28:04.790 --> 28:08.206
( chuckles )
You mean, inarticulate?

28:08.207 --> 28:10.331
Yeah.

28:10.332 --> 28:12.207
That's the word
I was looking for.

28:27.624 --> 28:29.414
What are you doing Saturday?

28:29.415 --> 28:31.456
Huh?

28:31.457 --> 28:32.955
Whoa!

28:32.956 --> 28:34.915
I thought I told you to get
those knees looked at.

28:36.457 --> 28:37.748
And you know what?

28:37.749 --> 28:39.664
What?

28:39.665 --> 28:43.289
He likes me without the dress, and
the makeup and the stiletto heels.

28:43.290 --> 28:46.247
Oh, man, maybe the next one
will work out for you.

28:46.248 --> 28:48.872
Hmm, there's not going to be a next one.
He is the one.

28:48.873 --> 28:50.581
Oops.

28:50.582 --> 28:52.247
( glass shattering )

28:52.248 --> 28:53.623
There you are.

28:53.624 --> 28:54.914
We saw you at the roof.

28:54.915 --> 28:58.080
You guys look so cute together.

28:58.081 --> 28:59.789
Guess what?
What?

28:59.790 --> 29:01.955
He totally kissed me.

29:01.956 --> 29:04.289
Oh. You go, girl.

29:04.290 --> 29:06.247
( crashing )

29:06.248 --> 29:07.414
CANDI: Ah!

29:07.415 --> 29:08.748
Who's that?

29:08.749 --> 29:09.790
Huh?

29:14.123 --> 29:16.830
Oh, it's...
Another woman.

29:16.831 --> 29:18.456
Maybe they're just good friends.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.122
Then why is he
closing the blinds?

29:20.123 --> 29:21.581
He never closes the blinds.

29:21.582 --> 29:22.748
Maybe she's his sister.

29:22.749 --> 29:25.247
We are not in the outback, Candi.

29:25.248 --> 29:28.955
Amanda, we're so sorry. Our creep
radar didn't go off with him at all.

29:28.956 --> 29:30.414
Hmm, it's okay.

29:30.415 --> 29:32.830
I haven't been able
to believe my eyes or my heart.

29:32.831 --> 29:35.122
Why should my knees
be any different, right?

29:35.123 --> 29:36.456
You know what? Forget him.

29:36.457 --> 29:37.955
Why don't you come out with us?

29:37.956 --> 29:39.247
No, no. You guys go ahead.

29:39.248 --> 29:40.623
You sure?
Uh-huh.

29:40.624 --> 29:41.790
I'm totally fine.
Okay

29:46.831 --> 29:49.581
CANDI: Oh, Mandy, I can't see you

29:49.582 --> 29:51.499
but I know you must be sad.

29:52.624 --> 29:53.707
My god.

29:55.373 --> 29:56.665
( screams )

29:59.665 --> 30:01.914
Oh! Oh, my god!

30:01.915 --> 30:03.581
Did someone scream?

30:03.582 --> 30:05.706
Temporary blindness
has improved my hearing.

30:05.707 --> 30:07.872
You guys, get out here.

30:07.873 --> 30:09.872
What?
Oh, my god!

30:09.873 --> 30:11.331
What's happening?

30:11.332 --> 30:12.955
Are they having sex?

30:12.956 --> 30:14.247
I think he killed her.

30:14.248 --> 30:15.665
How do you mean, killed?

30:17.831 --> 30:18.831
Killed, as in dead.

30:20.624 --> 30:22.955
Well, where's the body?

30:22.956 --> 30:23.831
Huh?

30:25.831 --> 30:28.039
She's gone. She was lying right there.

30:28.040 --> 30:29.247
Where are you going?

30:29.248 --> 30:30.539
You're calling him?

30:30.540 --> 30:32.789
Yeah, I want to make sure
he didn't hurt himself

30:32.790 --> 30:34.539
while he was killing the blonde.

30:34.540 --> 30:36.039
That's so sweet.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.914
I'm calling the police.

30:37.915 --> 30:40.873
Hi. Um, I'd like to report a murder.

30:43.332 --> 30:44.373
I'll hold.

30:45.540 --> 30:47.372
How many screams did you hear?

30:47.373 --> 30:48.749
Just one.

30:50.165 --> 30:52.372
See, it's right here.

30:52.373 --> 30:53.872
And so you turned around

30:53.873 --> 30:56.581
and poof, the body
just disappears.

30:56.582 --> 30:58.706
I didn't say "poof",
I believe I said "bam".

30:58.707 --> 31:00.206
And "bam!" the body's gone.

31:00.207 --> 31:01.581
I'm sure it is.

31:01.582 --> 31:04.664
CANDI: Hello, officer.
What's happening?

31:04.665 --> 31:08.581
Okay, so what exactly
did this Winston guy do?

31:08.582 --> 31:10.706
Well, there were the
catholic school girls.

31:10.707 --> 31:12.498
What did he do with the school girls?

31:12.499 --> 31:14.581
He was buying candy bars.
But that's not...

31:14.582 --> 31:16.414
Were they witnesses, or accomplices?

31:16.415 --> 31:20.080
Well, I don't know, But Mr. Perfect
sure did spend a lot of money.

31:20.081 --> 31:22.206
Who's Mr. Perfect?
We call him Mr. Perfect,

31:22.207 --> 31:25.080
because of the old lady,
the big dog and the love child.

31:25.081 --> 31:26.414
The love child?

31:26.415 --> 31:28.581
Forget about the love child.
I'll tell you exactly...

31:28.582 --> 31:29.997
We saw him lifting.

31:29.998 --> 31:32.414
So the body didn't disappear.
You saw him lift it?

31:32.415 --> 31:34.247
We saw him lift himself.

31:34.248 --> 31:36.289
Up and down.
Up and down.

31:36.290 --> 31:39.456
( laughs ) He gets very sweaty.

31:39.457 --> 31:41.664
So, you didn't see him lift the body?

31:41.665 --> 31:42.997
Like I told you before...

31:42.998 --> 31:45.039
We were in middle
of wardrobe change.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.039
Was there anybody else
here in the room?

31:47.040 --> 31:48.415
I was in the room. Yes.

31:50.290 --> 31:51.997
Okay.

31:51.998 --> 31:55.247
( chuckles ) I think I've heard
as much as I need.

31:55.248 --> 31:58.122
Look, I don't think you're
taking this very seriously here.

31:58.123 --> 32:00.789
To be honest, I don't
believe any of this.

32:00.790 --> 32:04.414
A bunch of bored models sitting
around sniffing nail polish.

32:04.415 --> 32:06.789
Suddenly, "bam," you think you see something.

32:06.790 --> 32:08.331
Now, don't get all hysterical.

32:08.332 --> 32:10.664
I'm still going to investigate it.
It's my job.

32:10.665 --> 32:13.914
Nobody pays me 1,000 dollars a day
to sit on my duff looking pretty.

32:13.915 --> 32:15.748
Big surprise, sparky.

32:15.749 --> 32:18.331
You know, a serious crime
has been committed,

32:18.332 --> 32:21.623
and all you are doing is standing
around insulting me and my friends.

32:21.624 --> 32:23.414
I want your badge number.

32:23.415 --> 32:25.247
Here it is.

32:25.248 --> 32:26.831
That's if you can count this high.

32:28.081 --> 32:29.623
Let's go.

32:29.624 --> 32:31.499
Good evening, ladies.
Bye.

33:03.332 --> 33:04.831
( door opens )

33:08.499 --> 33:10.164
Hey.

33:10.165 --> 33:12.456
You guys are just getting
home at 7:00 in the morning?

33:12.457 --> 33:14.247
Yeah, the team
had to fly to Atlanta.

33:14.248 --> 33:15.415
Yeah.

33:16.665 --> 33:18.498
So, I guess Jim didn't do it.

33:18.499 --> 33:20.372
Why do you say that?
Is it in the paper?

33:20.373 --> 33:22.707
No. He's standing right
there in his apartment.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.373
Oh, my god.

33:33.373 --> 33:35.872
No, I will not buzz off until you tell me

33:35.873 --> 33:37.872
why Jim Winston is still in his apartment.

33:37.873 --> 33:40.581
Is he out on bail?
Do murderers usually get bail?

33:40.582 --> 33:43.372
No, sometimes we just
release them for fun.

33:43.373 --> 33:45.955
Look, no body, no crime.

33:45.956 --> 33:48.122
Well, how do you explain what I saw?

33:48.123 --> 33:50.830
The woman, Megan O' Brien.
She tripped over a rug.

33:50.831 --> 33:53.372
When you turned your back,
Mr. Winston picked her up.

33:53.373 --> 33:54.748
So, he's not a killer?

33:54.749 --> 33:56.456
Actually seems like a great guy.

33:56.457 --> 33:58.914
And this Megan woman, she's okay?

33:58.915 --> 33:59.915
I guess.

34:03.582 --> 34:05.206
What do you mean, "You guess"?

34:05.207 --> 34:06.581
It's a yes or no question.

34:06.582 --> 34:08.246
Look, we haven't talked to her yet.

34:08.248 --> 34:10.830
She's out of town on business,
we'll track her down.

34:10.831 --> 34:15.121
Okay. When you do talk to her, can you call
me immediately? This is very important to me.

34:15.123 --> 34:16.748
Sure, Ms. Pierce.

34:16.748 --> 34:19.080
I'll put your number in the
precinct speed dial right now.

34:19.081 --> 34:20.456
( both laughing )

34:25.248 --> 34:26.415
Jackass!

34:37.623 --> 34:39.956
Is this it?
Oh.

34:45.623 --> 34:47.623
Not one step further.

34:47.623 --> 34:49.290
This place is filthy.

34:50.581 --> 34:51.996
Hey!

34:51.998 --> 34:54.955
Oh, Amanda, I was talking
to my shrink this morning,

34:54.956 --> 34:56.748
and she said that you're projecting.

34:56.748 --> 34:59.122
What you thought you saw
Jim do through the window

34:59.123 --> 35:01.914
was actually your desire
to kill all your ex-boyfriends.

35:01.915 --> 35:04.122
Why are you talking
to your therapist about me?

35:04.123 --> 35:06.372
She says I talk way too
much about myself.

35:06.373 --> 35:08.581
Amanda, we came down
here because we decided

35:08.582 --> 35:10.706
you should keep your date with this Jim guy.

35:10.707 --> 35:13.122
I mean, come on, he's way
too cute to be a killer.

35:13.123 --> 35:15.955
And you said yourself the cops
don't have anything on him.

35:15.956 --> 35:18.539
Look, you guys, I appreciate the effort.
Really, I do.

35:18.540 --> 35:22.164
But guess what, I'm not going out with
Mr. Psycho Killer Guy. So go home.

35:22.165 --> 35:23.830
Please don't make them go home.

35:23.831 --> 35:26.706
Amanda, seriously, you really
don't know what happened.

35:26.707 --> 35:29.164
That is not true.
You guys didn't see what I saw.

35:29.165 --> 35:32.498
And you didn't see what we saw when
you were on the stairs with him.

35:32.499 --> 35:35.080
And what was that?
That you're crazy-sick in love.

35:35.081 --> 35:37.039
That is not true.
I am 100 percent over him.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.456
That's why you've spent the whole morning

35:39.457 --> 35:41.914
staring at that drawing of his face.

35:41.915 --> 35:44.914
So? Big deal.
He has a good face.

35:44.915 --> 35:47.206
And yeah, maybe there
is some mysterious,

35:47.207 --> 35:48.997
yet valid explanation for what I saw.

35:48.998 --> 35:51.414
But why should I start going
out with the guy when

35:51.415 --> 35:53.997
he's shaping up to be a bigger
liar than the rest of them?

35:53.998 --> 35:56.414
So what? All men lie.
We know that.

35:56.415 --> 36:00.372
Exactly. If you don't like what the police
aren't doing, start your own investigation.

36:00.373 --> 36:02.331
What are you...

36:02.332 --> 36:05.039
That way you can find out for yourself
if he's a nice bloke or a slasher.

36:05.040 --> 36:08.247
Or if he's lying about being married.
Don King fooled me on that one.

36:08.248 --> 36:09.372
Twice.

36:09.373 --> 36:11.039
Look, I don't care about him!

36:11.040 --> 36:12.872
Amanda, if you don't sort this out,

36:12.873 --> 36:14.706
you'll never have a good relationship

36:14.707 --> 36:16.080
for the rest of your life.

36:16.081 --> 36:19.122
You'll end up a pathetic, lonely old woman

36:19.123 --> 36:24.539
who makes her co-workers watch videos
of her cat's lame-ass birthday parties.

36:24.540 --> 36:27.706
You say what you want about me, you tramp.

36:27.707 --> 36:30.873
But don't you go bad-mouthing Jane-cat!

36:33.165 --> 36:34.372
Enough!

36:34.373 --> 36:37.539
Everyone shut up and listen to me!
All of you!

36:37.540 --> 36:39.080
Young and old, gay and straight.

36:39.081 --> 36:41.581
I'm going to have red beans for dinner.

36:41.582 --> 36:43.456
And especially the deaf.

36:43.457 --> 36:44.623
Hmm?

36:44.624 --> 36:46.664
I don't care about him.

36:46.665 --> 36:49.789
I don't care about the
baby-sitting or his eyes.

36:49.790 --> 36:53.749
Or the fact that he can do a zillion
pully-uppy things on that bar.

36:55.540 --> 36:58.247
And I don't care about his sexy grin.

36:58.248 --> 37:00.581
Or the fact he can make me laugh,

37:00.582 --> 37:03.581
even when his dog is trying to hump me.

37:03.582 --> 37:09.581
( sobs ) And I really don't care I fall
asleep every night dreaming about him.

37:09.582 --> 37:12.247
Because I am not crazy.

37:12.248 --> 37:14.790
I saw him kill that girl and I know it.

37:17.749 --> 37:21.539
I'm gonna have red beans for dinner.

37:21.540 --> 37:22.581
Gladys!

37:22.582 --> 37:24.247
What?

37:24.248 --> 37:26.372
I only caught about every fifth word,

37:26.373 --> 37:28.789
but that girl is head over heels.

37:28.790 --> 37:30.247
I am not!

37:30.248 --> 37:32.122
( all laughing )

37:32.123 --> 37:35.289
Look, fine.
I will investigate him.

37:35.290 --> 37:37.623
I will stalk his ass just to prove to you

37:37.624 --> 37:39.955
that there is something
seriously off with this guy.

37:39.956 --> 37:42.165
And all of you are just
too stupid to see it.

37:48.123 --> 37:49.581
Can I help you?

37:49.582 --> 37:53.539
We were in apartment 403
last night and we want to be...

37:53.540 --> 37:55.456
Discreet. You understand.

37:55.457 --> 37:57.498
We, we left some clothes.

37:57.499 --> 37:58.706
Huh?

37:58.707 --> 38:00.372
What she means to say is our black,

38:00.373 --> 38:02.955
French-cut, crotchless panties.

38:02.956 --> 38:05.831
And the rest of the props from our act.

38:07.956 --> 38:09.206
Oh.

38:09.207 --> 38:10.831
So, you will help us, no?

38:12.457 --> 38:16.040
Sure, I'll trade you his key for that dress.

38:18.915 --> 38:20.456
( disco music playing )

38:20.457 --> 38:22.707
Mitch! You are a nasty boy!

38:30.165 --> 38:33.789
Look, don't blame me.
I didn't break the elevator.

38:33.790 --> 38:35.040
( whining )

38:37.998 --> 38:39.332
( panting )

38:48.373 --> 38:49.248
( door slams )

38:49.249 --> 38:50.539
Sorry.

38:50.540 --> 38:52.080
What exactly are we looking for?

38:52.081 --> 38:53.539
Evidence.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.914
Anything that may indicate
he's a cold-blooded killer.

38:55.915 --> 38:57.206
Okay.

38:57.207 --> 38:59.247
Oh, look. It's him with his grandparents.

38:59.248 --> 39:02.997
Oh, that is very cute.
Look at them.

39:02.998 --> 39:04.664
Hello! Hi!

39:04.665 --> 39:07.414
Girl who has a date with a
potential murderer in four days.

39:07.415 --> 39:09.206
Can we get back to work, please?

39:09.207 --> 39:10.539
Jim might be home any minute.

39:10.540 --> 39:11.955
Relax!

39:11.956 --> 39:14.080
We called his office,
he's in a meeting all day.

39:14.081 --> 39:17.872
Yeah, and Holly's waiting for a phone
call, so, she's keeping lookout.

39:17.873 --> 39:19.539
Yeah, I'm 17.

39:19.540 --> 39:22.707
Uh-huh. The year I was born?

39:25.040 --> 39:26.372
Look at this.

39:26.373 --> 39:27.872
What is it?

39:27.873 --> 39:29.331
Dirty laundry.

39:29.332 --> 39:31.581
He's got a whole pile of it
on a chair in his bedroom.

39:31.582 --> 39:32.914
So?

39:32.915 --> 39:34.164
I hate that.

39:34.165 --> 39:37.247
( gasps ) Look, it has a blood stain on it.

39:37.248 --> 39:40.414
That's why I brought it out.
He didn't pre-soak.

39:40.415 --> 39:42.080
That baby's set for life.

39:42.081 --> 39:43.915
This is going into evidence.

39:46.457 --> 39:48.581
Oh, yeah. Good, good.

39:48.582 --> 39:50.872
Now make love to the shirt.

39:50.873 --> 39:51.955
Good!

39:51.956 --> 39:53.331
( Candi moaning )

39:53.332 --> 39:54.623
Make love to the shirt.

39:54.624 --> 39:57.247
Now hate it. It hates you.
Bad shirt!

39:57.248 --> 39:59.456
( growling )

39:59.457 --> 40:01.414
There's a yellow stain right next to it.

40:01.415 --> 40:02.582
It's probably...

40:04.415 --> 40:06.247
It's ketchup.

40:06.248 --> 40:07.789
That's amazing.

40:07.790 --> 40:09.956
She's a bleeding
Sherlock Holmes.

40:11.081 --> 40:12.955
Amanda?
Huh?

40:12.956 --> 40:16.623
If you find 20 dollar bill on the
floor of somebody else's apartment,

40:16.624 --> 40:19.498
is that the same as
finding it on the street?

40:19.499 --> 40:21.623
No.

40:21.624 --> 40:23.290
Then, I haven't found anything.

40:26.415 --> 40:28.122
Oh, yes, you have.

40:28.123 --> 40:31.247
Where did you find that?
It's a box of knives.

40:31.248 --> 40:33.997
Not just knives, daggers.

40:33.998 --> 40:36.623
Yeah, cheese daggers.

40:36.624 --> 40:38.122
This Gouda is not bad.

40:38.123 --> 40:39.123
( clicking )

40:41.290 --> 40:42.290
( gasps )

40:45.165 --> 40:47.289
Oh, shit!

40:47.290 --> 40:48.956
Where the hell are they?

40:50.123 --> 40:53.039
Hey! Hey!
What do I do?

40:53.040 --> 40:54.997
Oh, god!

40:54.998 --> 40:56.664
What are you all doing?

40:56.665 --> 40:58.664
This is where she fell.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.206
Couldn't the police be right?

41:00.207 --> 41:01.498
( loud thump )

41:01.499 --> 41:02.540
What the hell was that?

41:04.332 --> 41:06.831
A kiwi. Aw.

41:09.540 --> 41:11.499
What is she doing?
Charades?

41:13.956 --> 41:16.664
I love charades. Okay.

41:16.665 --> 41:18.706
Sounds like?

41:18.707 --> 41:21.830
No. No props in charades.

41:21.831 --> 41:24.498
No props and no clothes.

41:24.499 --> 41:26.664
Uncle Pete's rules.

41:26.665 --> 41:28.164
Ew!

41:28.165 --> 41:30.706
Okay, Candi, no more
stories from the dark farm.

41:30.707 --> 41:31.789
Pretty please?

41:31.790 --> 41:33.164
Hey!

41:33.165 --> 41:35.372
What? Jim's in the hallway?

41:35.373 --> 41:36.873
Everybody hide!

41:49.707 --> 41:51.080
I was here first.
Shh.

41:51.081 --> 41:52.415
You shh.
Shut up.

41:57.332 --> 41:59.539
Vince, it's me.

41:59.540 --> 42:02.415
Yeah, yeah. The breakfast meeting went well.

42:03.998 --> 42:06.206
I had to eat more of those damn pirogis,

42:06.207 --> 42:09.247
But I should get a meeting
with the chairman soon.

42:09.248 --> 42:11.373
Okay, perfect.

42:19.624 --> 42:21.581
No. Don't go in there.

42:21.582 --> 42:23.706
( gasps ) Don't go in there!

42:23.707 --> 42:24.749
Oh.

42:38.081 --> 42:39.457
( unzips )

42:45.373 --> 42:47.414
( grunts )

42:47.415 --> 42:48.749
( farting )

42:56.790 --> 42:58.955
What's going on in there?

42:58.956 --> 43:00.332
( farting )

43:08.165 --> 43:09.457
( sighs )

43:24.415 --> 43:25.831
( gagging )

43:27.332 --> 43:28.624
( sighs )

43:30.165 --> 43:33.080
Let me just say, if he
hadn't washed his hands,

43:33.081 --> 43:35.831
this investigation would be over.
Right here.

43:44.790 --> 43:46.997
So, he sounds pretty damn normal.

43:46.998 --> 43:49.955
Yeah, nothing really shouts
out psycho killer, you know.

43:49.956 --> 43:51.873
But I still feel like
I'm missing something.

43:56.499 --> 43:59.039
( loud crash )

43:59.040 --> 44:00.498
Hey!

44:00.499 --> 44:02.997
Sorry. I hope I didn't scare you.

44:02.998 --> 44:04.623
Jim, how did you get in here?

44:04.624 --> 44:07.164
Oh, I mentioned your name.
The guard let me in.

44:07.165 --> 44:10.997
Oh, so you're Jim?
The Jim.

44:10.998 --> 44:12.872
Nice to know I've been talked about.

44:12.873 --> 44:15.372
You have no idea.

44:15.373 --> 44:16.830
Oh, this is my friend, Lisa.

44:16.831 --> 44:18.539
She's a black belt in karate.

44:18.540 --> 44:21.039
( chuckles ) Hey, me too.

44:21.040 --> 44:23.039
Oh.

44:23.040 --> 44:24.664
I'm sorry for barging in,

44:24.665 --> 44:27.873
but I couldn't wait all the way
until Saturday to see you.

44:29.290 --> 44:32.331
Hey, is this Titian?

44:32.332 --> 44:33.914
Yeah. You know Titian?

44:33.915 --> 44:37.830
Literally the only thing
I remember from art history.

44:37.831 --> 44:40.706
Hey, do you want
to go grab a drink?

44:40.707 --> 44:42.414
Ah, I can't.

44:42.415 --> 44:44.789
I'm not comfortable with you,
leaving with you.

44:44.790 --> 44:48.039
I mean leaving without finishing this here.

44:48.040 --> 44:49.247
I understand.

44:49.248 --> 44:50.873
I'll let you get back to it.

44:52.248 --> 44:53.872
I'm sorry if I scared you.

44:53.873 --> 44:56.372
It's just me, not some psycho killer.

44:56.373 --> 44:57.997
( chuckles )

44:57.998 --> 44:58.873
For you.

45:06.915 --> 45:08.164
Hey, just curious.

45:08.165 --> 45:11.664
Did the police ever contact
that woman or find her body?

45:11.665 --> 45:15.456
Thanks a lot. You couldn't just let me
enjoy that for a second, could you?

45:15.457 --> 45:17.749
Maybe you'd better
keep investigating.

46:39.707 --> 46:42.955
I think so. The last time
I saw her she was all dolled up.

46:42.956 --> 46:44.664
Well, we'd better check her out.

46:44.665 --> 46:47.499
Make sure we don't have another
Megan O'Brien on our hands.

46:49.248 --> 46:50.955
For your collection.

46:50.956 --> 46:53.830
Oh, I have just the shoes for this.

46:53.831 --> 46:55.498
What do you want?

46:55.499 --> 46:57.332
Does he rent a storage space?

47:39.582 --> 47:41.206
( telephone ringing )

47:41.207 --> 47:44.539
Ah. This better be important.

47:44.540 --> 47:45.706
AMANDA: It's me.

47:45.707 --> 47:47.414
Guess what?
I found it.

47:47.415 --> 47:49.748
Found what?
The body.

47:49.749 --> 47:52.080
Jim kept it in a duffel
bag in his storage space.

47:52.081 --> 47:53.955
It was the only place we didn't search.

47:53.956 --> 47:56.247
In a duffel bag?
Where are you now?

47:56.248 --> 47:57.706
Central Park.

47:57.707 --> 47:59.456
A perfect place to bury a body.

47:59.457 --> 48:01.872
Who comes here after
dark besides murderers?

48:01.873 --> 48:03.414
Oh, wait, wait.
He stopped.

48:03.415 --> 48:04.790
Go, go, go.
Go past.

48:06.915 --> 48:08.289
Stop up there.

48:08.290 --> 48:09.914
Whose cottage cheese is this?

48:09.915 --> 48:11.122
Shh.

48:11.123 --> 48:12.081
Hold on a second.

48:13.582 --> 48:15.081
Thank you.
Keep the change.

48:17.415 --> 48:20.206
All right, I'm following him into the woods.

48:20.207 --> 48:21.789
Um, do you think...

48:21.790 --> 48:24.289
Maybe one of us should
hang up and call the police?

48:24.290 --> 48:26.206
Don't hang up on me.
This is it.

48:26.207 --> 48:27.582
He's put it down.

48:29.582 --> 48:31.664
Oh, my god. He just pulled out a shovel.

48:31.665 --> 48:33.247
He's going to bury it right here.

48:33.248 --> 48:34.624
Oh, my god.

48:36.165 --> 48:37.624
Wait, maybe it's not a shovel.

48:39.165 --> 48:40.289
Well, what is it?

48:40.290 --> 48:41.665
It's...

48:43.081 --> 48:44.623
( kids cheering )

48:44.624 --> 48:45.997
It's a baseball bat.

48:45.998 --> 48:47.748
Run!

48:47.749 --> 48:49.623
Oh.

48:49.624 --> 48:51.289
For a little league team.

48:51.290 --> 48:53.289
He coaches a little league team.

48:53.290 --> 48:55.581
That is so sweet.

48:55.582 --> 48:57.664
Isn't that sweet?

48:57.665 --> 49:00.039
Hello? Hello?

49:00.040 --> 49:04.539
Amanda, please tell us you're going
to stop investigating him now.

49:04.540 --> 49:06.499
Only long enough
to go out with him.

49:09.665 --> 49:11.581
( doorbell rings )

49:11.582 --> 49:13.332
STRUKOV: Oh, is this the...

49:17.207 --> 49:18.789
Okay.

49:18.790 --> 49:22.664
Kind sir, I don't mean
to be discriminatory,

49:22.665 --> 49:25.289
but there is an age limit
to get on the waiting list.

49:25.290 --> 49:26.997
( chuckles ) No, no, no.

49:26.998 --> 49:28.997
Uh, pardon me, my name is Halloran.

49:28.998 --> 49:31.456
I'm here to see Ms. Amanda
Pierce about some work.

49:31.457 --> 49:32.831
We spoke on the phone.

49:37.040 --> 49:39.581
Wow.

49:39.582 --> 49:41.872
It's very unusual.
Russian turn of the century?

49:41.873 --> 49:43.831
Well, I'm impressed
you know your stuff.

49:45.081 --> 49:47.372
What are these holes?

49:47.373 --> 49:49.289
I think mice.

49:49.290 --> 49:50.457
Very neat mice.

49:53.332 --> 49:54.414
( crashing )

49:54.415 --> 49:57.706
Oh, excuse us.

49:57.707 --> 50:00.206
I booked my first big
runway show tomorrow.

50:00.207 --> 50:01.540
Great.

50:05.915 --> 50:07.332
( Strukov chuckling )

50:08.332 --> 50:10.039
Nice view.

50:10.040 --> 50:12.872
Yeah, if you are into that sort of thing.

50:12.873 --> 50:14.873
We usually keep the blinds closed.

50:16.540 --> 50:18.872
( upbeat music playing )

50:18.873 --> 50:20.372
Jim, how is it going?

50:20.373 --> 50:22.914
Uh, Bernie.

50:22.915 --> 50:25.039
Listen, what ever happened to Megan?

50:25.040 --> 50:26.664
You know, it's like
she's disappeared.

50:26.665 --> 50:29.498
Megan? Megan O'Brien.

50:29.499 --> 50:31.289
You know, the blonde?
It's weird.

50:31.290 --> 50:33.039
Nobody's seen her since your party.

50:33.040 --> 50:34.623
What the hell happened to her?

50:34.624 --> 50:36.415
You know, I, I, I don't know if I...

50:38.749 --> 50:40.748
I think she went on vacation.

50:40.749 --> 50:43.581
Vacation during fashion week?
That's crazy.

50:43.582 --> 50:45.415
It's good to see you, Bern.

50:50.790 --> 50:52.248
Anything look good for dessert?

50:53.749 --> 50:55.915
Mmm, everything.

50:58.831 --> 51:00.955
We'll have everything.
Very good, sir.

51:00.956 --> 51:03.080
What? Are you kidding?

51:03.081 --> 51:06.456
No. I'm not in a rush.
Are you?

51:06.457 --> 51:09.247
No. This is awesome.

51:09.248 --> 51:12.414
Do you realize that every time you
took a bite of something good,

51:12.415 --> 51:15.914
you made a little sound like, "mmm."

51:15.915 --> 51:17.289
I did? Oh, god.

51:17.290 --> 51:19.790
No, no. It's like a cat purring or...

51:21.457 --> 51:23.749
I just, I like it, that's all.

51:26.373 --> 51:29.539
Okay, they made it to the dessert
course without bloodshed.

51:29.540 --> 51:31.080
So, can we go to the party now?

51:31.081 --> 51:32.748
Yeah. Let's hurry.

51:32.749 --> 51:35.290
I'm getting hives just from
being around these ugly people.

51:36.332 --> 51:37.457
( slurping )

51:40.207 --> 51:41.581
Guys, get serious.

51:41.582 --> 51:43.914
I told you, I think he
killed that Megan girl.

51:43.915 --> 51:46.456
We never should have pushed
Amanda to go out with him.

51:46.457 --> 51:49.164
The fashion world is complicated.

51:49.165 --> 51:50.748
It's all about the next thing.

51:50.749 --> 51:54.456
Everybody's running around all
crazy, looking for some new idea.

51:54.457 --> 51:57.623
But they're too frantic
to actually experience it.

51:57.624 --> 51:59.914
That's not what I want.

51:59.915 --> 52:01.289
What do you want?

52:01.290 --> 52:03.414
To know a good thing when I find it.

52:03.415 --> 52:05.498
Like tonight.

52:05.499 --> 52:08.831
The way you look,
you make me feel, uh...

52:10.665 --> 52:13.872
I just wish I could freeze this
moment and hold on to it, you know.

52:13.873 --> 52:15.164
Mmm-hmm.

52:15.165 --> 52:16.831
( pager beeps )

52:20.499 --> 52:22.164
Let's get out of here.

52:22.165 --> 52:23.955
What? What about dessert?

52:23.956 --> 52:26.498
Uh, sorry.
Do me favor.

52:26.499 --> 52:27.831
Meet me outside, okay?

52:29.624 --> 52:31.122
Oh, no!

52:31.123 --> 52:32.331
They're coming at us.

52:32.332 --> 52:33.831
Amanda will freak if she sees us.

52:51.373 --> 52:54.247
( whispers ) It's Jim, again!

52:54.248 --> 52:56.581
Please, please.
Just let him pee.

52:56.582 --> 52:58.914
MAN 1: Did you lock the door?
MAN 2: Yeah.

52:58.915 --> 53:01.247
We've only got a few minutes.
I want that bad boy out.

53:01.248 --> 53:02.372
Here you go.

53:02.373 --> 53:04.539
That is huge.

53:04.540 --> 53:06.539
All right, I'm going to stick it in.

53:06.540 --> 53:08.206
Sweet.

53:08.207 --> 53:09.748
( screams )

53:09.749 --> 53:11.955
Oh, man! Careful!
Don't worry.

53:11.956 --> 53:14.331
I've stuffed it into
tighter holes than this.

53:14.332 --> 53:15.623
( water gurgling )

53:15.624 --> 53:17.207
No, I'm out with her right now.

53:22.415 --> 53:23.914
Fine. Fine.

53:23.915 --> 53:26.372
You want a body?
I'll give them a goddamn body.

53:26.373 --> 53:29.080
MAN: Geez, take it easy.

53:29.081 --> 53:31.456
What are you doing?
It's gonna blow, man!

53:31.457 --> 53:32.582
( water gurgling )

53:33.582 --> 53:36.289
That can't be good.

53:36.290 --> 53:38.331
( screaming )

53:38.332 --> 53:39.749
ROXANA: Shit! Shit!

53:44.624 --> 53:46.415
JIM: Okay, don't move.

53:48.415 --> 53:51.581
Uh, hey, Jim.
What's going on here?

53:51.582 --> 53:53.248
Where are we, exactly?

53:54.749 --> 53:56.915
All right, you can open them up, now.

54:02.499 --> 54:04.122
Jim, how did you...

54:04.123 --> 54:05.539
I know some people.

54:05.540 --> 54:07.997
I used to clean the aquariums
here when I was a kid.

54:07.998 --> 54:09.539
They're amazing.

54:09.540 --> 54:11.914
They're Beluga whales.

54:11.915 --> 54:14.289
That's, uh, Ben.

54:14.290 --> 54:16.498
Uh-huh.
And that's Betty.

54:16.499 --> 54:18.457
That's Ben's second wife.

54:19.790 --> 54:21.623
Whenever I get stressed out,

54:21.624 --> 54:23.789
I come here, watch these guys,

54:23.790 --> 54:25.997
try to be more like them.

54:25.998 --> 54:28.122
"Mr. Fishtank."

54:28.123 --> 54:30.039
What?

54:30.040 --> 54:32.290
"Mr. Fishtank."
That's what Candi...

54:36.081 --> 54:38.123
That's what I'm going
to start calling you.

54:41.915 --> 54:45.872
♪ 'Cause I like the sun ♪

54:45.873 --> 54:50.498
♪ And the darkness to turn into light ♪

Wait.

55:13.499 --> 55:16.331
This might not seem Like the
most "guy-like" thing to say,

55:16.332 --> 55:18.247
but do you think we're moving too fast?

55:18.248 --> 55:20.830
I mean, you hardly know me.

55:20.831 --> 55:21.955
Oh.

55:21.956 --> 55:23.831
I feel like I know you all too well.

55:25.790 --> 55:27.873
Somehow, already.

55:35.415 --> 55:37.206
You're right.

55:37.207 --> 55:40.206
I've wanted to do this ever
since Hamlet drooled on you.

55:40.207 --> 55:41.665
Me, too.

55:43.373 --> 55:46.247
Do you believe in love at first sight?

55:46.248 --> 55:48.707
At first sight?
It's too easy.

55:50.040 --> 55:52.373
I believe in taking a deeper look.

56:05.499 --> 56:07.540
Hey, how are you doing?

56:10.415 --> 56:11.915
( screaming )

56:16.290 --> 56:18.748
Watch it, stinky.
You smell like poop.

56:18.749 --> 56:21.664
Think we should tell Amanda?
I don't know! Ugh!

56:21.665 --> 56:23.080
It's probably nothing.

56:23.081 --> 56:25.247
ROXANA: We should probably say something.

56:25.248 --> 56:28.581
I definitely don't want to be the
one that ruins their relationship.

56:28.582 --> 56:32.581
Which seems to be going very well.
They're really clicking sexually.

56:32.582 --> 56:33.914
How do you know?

56:33.915 --> 56:36.414
She forgot to pull down the blinds.

56:36.415 --> 56:38.414
( giggling )

56:38.415 --> 56:39.582
Ow.

56:53.873 --> 56:56.789
Okay, I'm starting a new religion.

56:56.790 --> 56:59.456
( panting )
It's called "Amandaism,"

56:59.457 --> 57:02.123
and basically, it's me, worshiping you.

57:03.332 --> 57:05.623
Well, then.

57:05.624 --> 57:09.164
It's time for a little confession.

57:09.165 --> 57:12.830
You have to start telling me a
little bit more about yourself.

57:12.831 --> 57:15.581
Like what?
Anything.

57:15.582 --> 57:17.872
Just tell me all your secrets.

57:17.873 --> 57:21.247
Well, I'm not really
a "secrets" kind of guy.

57:21.248 --> 57:22.789
Come on.

57:22.790 --> 57:25.456
Everybody has some secrets.

57:25.457 --> 57:29.123
Well, there is one fact
I've been hiding from you.

57:35.290 --> 57:39.498
I happen to be a master of daggers.

57:39.499 --> 57:41.206
HOLLY: What is he doing?

57:41.207 --> 57:43.830
Jade, I think we were wrong
about those cheese knives.

57:43.831 --> 57:45.498
A master of daggers?

57:45.499 --> 57:47.581
Oh, yes.

57:47.582 --> 57:49.331
You know, I was just teasing.

57:49.332 --> 57:52.914
Oh, my god. I should have never
let her go over there tonight.

57:52.915 --> 57:53.831
( screaming )

58:04.415 --> 58:05.790
Now, I know your secret.

58:06.873 --> 58:08.247
What?

58:08.248 --> 58:09.831
You throw like a girl.

58:11.081 --> 58:12.499
( laughing ) Whoa.

58:28.665 --> 58:29.873
( yawning )

58:34.707 --> 58:36.331
Oh, man.

58:36.332 --> 58:38.331
I forgot to close the blinds.

58:38.332 --> 58:39.789
( yawning ) Darling.

58:39.790 --> 58:42.539
After that performance,
I want to be your friend.

58:42.540 --> 58:45.206
Yeah. Hey, how did you do
that thing with your back?

58:45.207 --> 58:46.872
Okay.

58:46.873 --> 58:50.122
I could get really freaked out about this.
But guess what?

58:50.123 --> 58:52.623
Jim is taking me to Shelter
Island for the weekend,

58:52.624 --> 58:55.539
and he says he has something
important he wants to tell me.

58:55.540 --> 58:57.623
Congratulations. You bag him.

58:57.624 --> 58:59.872
I know, I know. I don't
want to get too excited,

58:59.873 --> 59:02.164
but we're leaving early.
I've got to get to work.

59:02.165 --> 59:03.664
Wow. That was fast.

59:03.665 --> 59:06.247
Okay, if they get married,
I'll throw a shower.

59:06.248 --> 59:07.372
I'll do the pictures.

59:07.373 --> 59:08.248
I do groomsmen.

59:08.249 --> 59:09.664
Hold on.

59:09.665 --> 59:13.581
He's taking her away?
Maybe permanently away?

59:13.582 --> 59:15.206
Oh.

59:15.207 --> 59:17.789
Hey, Roxana. Can I borrow that
Richard Tyler thing again?

59:17.790 --> 59:21.498
I don't know. I give to you,
I may never see again.

59:21.499 --> 59:23.122
Fine. Take it away.

59:23.123 --> 59:24.415
Thanks.

59:25.457 --> 59:27.247
( doorbell rings )

59:27.248 --> 59:28.581
Wait.

59:28.582 --> 59:30.955
Did I miss something here?

59:30.956 --> 59:34.539
At yesterday's show,
I heard some guy ask Jim

59:34.540 --> 59:37.206
about that woman
who disappeared and...

59:37.207 --> 59:38.748
And you were worried about me?

59:38.749 --> 59:40.122
Well, yeah.

59:40.123 --> 59:42.623
Hey, you guys, I thought we
could walk to work together.

59:42.624 --> 59:45.164
Lisa, I only live a block from the museum.

59:45.165 --> 59:47.456
I thought you could use the company.

59:47.457 --> 59:50.289
Look, Holly, please don't be worried.

59:50.290 --> 59:51.789
It's okay.
I have followed him.

59:51.790 --> 59:54.414
I have searched his apartment,
and now that I know him...

59:54.415 --> 59:55.872
Intimately.

59:55.873 --> 59:58.247
Darling, you left the blinds up.

59:58.248 --> 01:00:01.414
We all know him intimately.

01:00:01.415 --> 01:00:04.955
Believe me Amanda, we really want
it to work out between you and Jim.

01:00:04.956 --> 01:00:07.372
I mean, if could work out
for you guys after all this.

01:00:07.373 --> 01:00:10.623
Yeah, now we're all beachfront
property on the Hamptons.

01:00:10.624 --> 01:00:14.080
But in a few years, we're
gonna be condos in Jersey.

01:00:14.081 --> 01:00:16.830
I am gonna want a real
relationship before that happens.

01:00:16.831 --> 01:00:19.955
Preferably with a four-carat ring, D-flawless.

01:00:19.956 --> 01:00:21.623
That is so sweet.

01:00:21.624 --> 01:00:24.748
ROXANA: Yeah, me too.
Only I want A-flawless.

01:00:24.749 --> 01:00:27.623
JADE: Roxy, there is no "A".
Diamond ratings start with "D".

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.499
ROXANA: You can't fool me. I want "A".

01:00:35.415 --> 01:00:37.039
Nice work, Amanda.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.956
Yes, the face is perfect.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.665
Yes, it is.

01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:00.873
No.

01:01:05.207 --> 01:01:07.914
I've been quite impressed
with the way you do business.

01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:12.164
We very much appreciate how you've handled
the little problem with the woman.

01:01:12.165 --> 01:01:13.414
Oh, that was no problem.

01:01:13.415 --> 01:01:15.706
I do have a question though.

01:01:15.707 --> 01:01:17.498
Antwerp.
Yes?

01:01:17.499 --> 01:01:19.206
How does the money get back here?

01:01:19.207 --> 01:01:22.789
Don't worry. I'm going
to explain everything to you.

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:26.456
I have plans to increase your
role within the organization.

01:01:26.457 --> 01:01:29.247
Excellent. Where are we meeting?

01:01:29.248 --> 01:01:32.206
There's time for a brief meeting
at the runway, at 5:00.

01:01:32.207 --> 01:01:34.206
Great. Which airport?
What's that?

01:01:34.207 --> 01:01:35.997
Uh, which one?
Jim.

01:01:35.998 --> 01:01:38.331
Mr. Halloran?
Amanda?

01:01:38.332 --> 01:01:40.039
What's this?

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.664
All she did was trip over a rug,
right then you helped her up.

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:43.748
Why is she dead?

01:01:43.749 --> 01:01:45.372
What are you talking about?

01:01:45.373 --> 01:01:47.456
This is the woman I saw in your apartment.

01:01:47.457 --> 01:01:50.581
The woman I saw killed by you.

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:51.914
What?

01:01:51.915 --> 01:01:53.539
What do you mean "saw"?

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.247
Okay, my apartment overlooks yours,

01:01:55.248 --> 01:01:57.080
and I can see everything that you do.

01:01:57.081 --> 01:01:59.372
I know, I should have told you but I didn't.

01:01:59.373 --> 01:02:00.872
Mr. Halloran knows.

01:02:00.873 --> 01:02:02.914
Wait a minute. How do you know Mr. Halloran?

01:02:02.915 --> 01:02:05.539
Amanda, oh, my god.
We really need to talk.

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:08.498
Amanda, let's get to the car.
We're really late, aren't we?

01:02:08.499 --> 01:02:10.247
I'm not going anywhere with you.

01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:11.289
( gun clicks )

01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:13.582
I think we should all have a talk.

01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:21.498
( gunshot )

01:02:21.499 --> 01:02:23.289
( woman screams )

01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:24.415
( grunts )

01:02:28.998 --> 01:02:30.956
( shrieks )
Let go of me!

01:02:32.956 --> 01:02:34.248
( screaming )

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:42.790
( gunshots )

01:02:44.956 --> 01:02:46.331
( tires screeching )

01:02:46.332 --> 01:02:47.955
Follow him!
Shh.

01:02:47.956 --> 01:02:51.122
I was wrong about the girls.
They did see something.

01:02:51.123 --> 01:02:52.706
Let's take care of this.

01:02:52.707 --> 01:02:54.372
I can't believe this is happening.

01:02:54.373 --> 01:02:55.789
You're going to whack me.

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:58.122
You're going to take me
to New Jersey and whack me.

01:02:58.123 --> 01:02:59.955
Stop it, okay?
I'm not going to whack you.

01:02:59.956 --> 01:03:01.872
Why was Mr. Halloran shooting at me?

01:03:01.873 --> 01:03:04.539
Because he's not Mr. Halloran.
He's Vadim Strukov.

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.498
A very well connected Russian criminal.

01:03:06.499 --> 01:03:08.456
So what, are you a cop?

01:03:08.457 --> 01:03:10.997
Kind of.
Kind of?

01:03:10.998 --> 01:03:13.164
Let me see your badge.
I don't have one.

01:03:13.165 --> 01:03:15.872
Why don't you have a badge?
Because I'm undercover.

01:03:15.873 --> 01:03:18.706
Oh, hey, you know what?
I'm undercover, too.

01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:21.498
Did you want to see my badge?
Oopsie! I don't have one!

01:03:21.499 --> 01:03:23.165
( screams ) Cut it out!

01:03:33.582 --> 01:03:36.372
Will you stop it?
What's the matter with you?

01:03:36.373 --> 01:03:38.997
But I saw you!
I saw you murder that woman.

01:03:38.998 --> 01:03:40.872
No, you didn't.
Uh-huh.

01:03:40.873 --> 01:03:44.456
There was no murder. That whole
thing was staged for Strukov.

01:03:44.457 --> 01:03:46.664
He was on a roof across
the courtyard watching.

01:03:46.665 --> 01:03:48.706
What are you talking about?

01:03:48.707 --> 01:03:52.414
( sighs ) I'm a federal agent, with the FBI.

01:03:52.415 --> 01:03:54.372
So is Megan.

01:03:54.373 --> 01:03:56.247
( pants ) FBI?

01:03:56.248 --> 01:03:58.872
Yes. Megan's cover got blown.

01:03:58.873 --> 01:04:02.080
So we staged it as a way
for me to prove my loyalty.

01:04:02.081 --> 01:04:05.122
That picture in The Post?
We planted it.

01:04:05.123 --> 01:04:07.872
Strukov was getting suspicious
that no body had turned up.

01:04:07.873 --> 01:04:09.872
Well, what do these Russian guys do?

01:04:09.873 --> 01:04:13.247
Criminals like Strukov make hundreds
of millions of illegal dollars.

01:04:13.248 --> 01:04:15.122
They can't just put it in a bank.

01:04:15.123 --> 01:04:16.872
They find a young hot-shot like me.

01:04:16.873 --> 01:04:19.372
They give me the money,
I buy the dresses from Antwerp.

01:04:19.373 --> 01:04:22.331
Then they import them back here.
Then the money's clean.

01:04:22.332 --> 01:04:24.247
But hundreds of millions of dollars?

01:04:24.248 --> 01:04:26.372
They must be selling a whole lot of dresses.

01:04:26.373 --> 01:04:28.372
But they're not.
They sell hardly any.

01:04:28.373 --> 01:04:30.581
Well, then how do they get their money back?

01:04:30.582 --> 01:04:33.830
I was about to find out before you
showed up early and blew my cover.

01:04:33.831 --> 01:04:35.914
I was only early because I was excited

01:04:35.915 --> 01:04:37.915
about going away for the weekend with you.

01:04:39.248 --> 01:04:42.247
Amanda, I'm sorry.

01:04:42.248 --> 01:04:47.498
I didn't plan to meet you, or
get so involved with you or...

01:04:47.499 --> 01:04:49.414
Hold on, I think I'm getting through.

01:04:49.415 --> 01:04:52.247
Hey, it looks like Halloran
is actually Vadim Strukov.

01:04:52.248 --> 01:04:55.748
He's the chairman. He was
under my nose the whole time.

01:04:55.749 --> 01:04:58.664
He was talking about a
meeting at a runway at 5:00.

01:04:58.665 --> 01:05:00.247
I don't know which airport.

01:05:00.248 --> 01:05:01.872
Cover them all.
Wait.

01:05:01.873 --> 01:05:04.372
Those were bullet holes
in Mr. Halloran's painting.

01:05:04.373 --> 01:05:06.955
What? What are you talking about?

01:05:06.956 --> 01:05:11.164
I'm privately restoring a painting
for Mr. Halloran. That's how we met.

01:05:11.165 --> 01:05:13.080
Oh, my god.
It was a Russian painting.

01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:14.955
He's been to your apartment?

01:05:14.956 --> 01:05:17.123
Why? Do you think my
roommates are in danger?

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:20.997
Oh, crap.

01:05:20.998 --> 01:05:22.248
( tires screech )

01:05:23.499 --> 01:05:24.915
( doorbell rings )

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:34.080
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.

01:05:34.081 --> 01:05:36.749
Waiting list does not begin
for another five hours.

01:05:37.956 --> 01:05:39.914
( clicks gun )

01:05:39.915 --> 01:05:41.915
Okay, maybe you can jump the list.

01:05:49.332 --> 01:05:50.749
Stay here.

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.331
( speaking Russian )

01:05:54.332 --> 01:05:56.830
FBI! Freeze!

01:05:56.831 --> 01:05:58.581
Put your hands on your head.

01:05:58.582 --> 01:06:00.664
Not you, girls. Him!

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:02.830
( barking )

01:06:02.831 --> 01:06:04.164
Hamlet, stay!

01:06:04.165 --> 01:06:05.331
Hamlet, no!

01:06:05.332 --> 01:06:06.332
( screams )

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:07.499
( grunts )

01:06:15.831 --> 01:06:18.332
JADE: These handcuffs are too tight.

01:06:24.457 --> 01:06:27.997
Okay, would somebody friendly
please tell me what is going on.

01:06:27.998 --> 01:06:29.830
Jim's an undercover FBI agent.

01:06:29.831 --> 01:06:32.540
No, he's not. Everybody
knows he's Jim Winston.

01:06:34.332 --> 01:06:35.997
Oh, my god.

01:06:35.998 --> 01:06:39.247
Jim Winston isn't even your real name.

01:06:39.248 --> 01:06:42.664
I slept with a man, and I don't
even know his real name.

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.706
Okay, so what's your real name?

01:06:44.707 --> 01:06:48.247
It's, uh, Smoot.
Bob Smoot.

01:06:48.248 --> 01:06:50.372
Bob Smoot.
Hi.

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:53.539
I'm going to die handcuffed
next to a guy named Bob Smoot?

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.331
I can't die here.

01:06:55.332 --> 01:06:57.997
This place is full of ugly dresses.

01:06:57.998 --> 01:07:01.039
Jim or Bob, or whatever your name is...

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.247
If ever you're ever pretending to
be in the fashion business again...

01:07:04.248 --> 01:07:06.039
A little note, except for strippers,

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.706
women like jewelry on their
fingers, not on their tits.

01:07:08.707 --> 01:07:10.872
Maybe there are a lot of strippers in Antwerp.

01:07:10.873 --> 01:07:13.039
Antwerp? Nobody makes dresses in Antwerp.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.915
The only thing that comes from
Antwerp is diamonds. Good ones.

01:07:17.248 --> 01:07:18.415
( growling )

01:07:20.998 --> 01:07:22.247
What are you doing?

01:07:22.248 --> 01:07:24.582
Stop it, stop it, that's disgusting.

01:07:25.624 --> 01:07:27.414
Stop it!

01:07:27.415 --> 01:07:28.914
Man.

01:07:28.915 --> 01:07:30.248
Smoot is kinky.

01:07:33.207 --> 01:07:35.914
If that was a rhinestone, I
would've been able to crush it,

01:07:35.915 --> 01:07:37.872
instead of just chipping my tooth.

01:07:37.873 --> 01:07:39.664
Huh?
The dresses.

01:07:39.665 --> 01:07:43.122
I was so obsessed about tracking the
money, I forgot about the dresses.

01:07:43.123 --> 01:07:45.539
Antwerp. Russia.

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:48.623
They were never laundering money,
they were smuggling diamonds.

01:07:48.624 --> 01:07:51.748
You can go to Tiffany's and have a
fat business man from Cleveland

01:07:51.749 --> 01:07:53.623
buy you all the diamonds you want.

01:07:53.624 --> 01:07:56.915
Not the Russian diamonds. It's illegal
to take diamonds out of country.

01:07:58.624 --> 01:08:00.414
Oh, Holly, you borrowed my panties again.

01:08:00.415 --> 01:08:01.997
Diamonds.

01:08:01.998 --> 01:08:06.955
That's why Strukov never let me
take one for girlfriend or wife.

01:08:06.956 --> 01:08:08.289
Bastard.

01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:10.498
Harold, I'll make a deal with you, right now.

01:08:10.499 --> 01:08:12.997
You get us out of here and
turn State's evidence,

01:08:12.998 --> 01:08:14.955
I guarantee they will go easy on you.

01:08:14.956 --> 01:08:16.622
Think about it, Harold.

01:08:16.624 --> 01:08:18.538
Federal Witness Protection program.

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:21.622
We're booking people into Hawaii right now.

01:08:21.624 --> 01:08:22.788
Psst! Psst!

01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:23.955
Harold.

01:08:23.956 --> 01:08:25.790
( speaking Russian )

01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:33.331
( speaking Russian )

01:08:33.332 --> 01:08:36.247
( laughing )

01:08:36.247 --> 01:08:37.457
( grunts )

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.499
Whoa! At least he wasn't
lying about that black belt.

01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:52.165
What are you doing?
It's evidence.

01:08:53.499 --> 01:08:55.038
What are you doing?

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.206
Tennis bracelet.

01:08:56.207 --> 01:08:57.290
( sighs )

01:08:59.122 --> 01:09:00.872
You see...

01:09:00.872 --> 01:09:04.163
The diamonds are replaced by cheap
zirconiums before they go to the shipping...

01:09:04.165 --> 01:09:06.997
So everything we've been
through together is been a lie?

01:09:06.997 --> 01:09:08.913
Not everything.
Just the little things.

01:09:08.915 --> 01:09:10.830
Like your name, your job.
The fact that

01:09:10.831 --> 01:09:13.332
all your ex's are in the
Witness Protection program?

01:09:17.207 --> 01:09:19.997
( shouting )

01:09:19.997 --> 01:09:21.540
( shrieking )

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:33.207
( shouting indistinctly )

01:09:34.372 --> 01:09:35.413
( screaming )

01:09:35.415 --> 01:09:36.707
Get in the limo.

01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:40.872
Excuse me.

01:09:42.624 --> 01:09:45.038
Who the hell are you people?

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.080
Hey, this is my limo.

01:09:47.081 --> 01:09:48.538
It's my limo. Ladies!

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:49.747
Ow.

01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:50.913
( gunshots )

01:09:50.915 --> 01:09:52.872
( screams )

01:09:52.872 --> 01:09:54.372
Stay down!

01:09:54.373 --> 01:09:56.664
Don't worry. I got the limo
at the Jackie auction.

01:09:56.665 --> 01:09:58.207
It's totally bulletproof.

01:09:59.207 --> 01:10:00.872
Mr. Alfredo?

01:10:00.873 --> 01:10:04.206
Oh my god. I'm Candi.
Let me just say,

01:10:04.207 --> 01:10:06.080
it's such an honor to meet you.

01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:07.914
Thank you, dear, but don't tease.

01:10:07.915 --> 01:10:10.997
It's bad enough that half my models
canceled on me with the flu.

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:14.247
What am I supposed to do
for my 5:00 runway show?

01:10:14.248 --> 01:10:15.997
Who's that?
It's Alfredo.

01:10:15.998 --> 01:10:18.539
Everybody knows Alfredo
does the hottest runway.

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.582
Yeah.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.247
Runway?
What? What is it?

01:10:23.248 --> 01:10:24.872
Jesus!

01:10:24.873 --> 01:10:26.914
So, Alfredo, do you need models?

01:10:26.915 --> 01:10:28.914
What the hell have I been saying?

01:10:28.915 --> 01:10:30.539
Well, what the hell do we look like?

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:31.872
Vince, it's Jim.

01:10:31.873 --> 01:10:35.623
Models with attitude.
I like it.

01:10:35.624 --> 01:10:36.914
You're hired.
All of you.

01:10:36.915 --> 01:10:38.623
( cheering )

01:10:38.624 --> 01:10:41.581
Hey, you know we're still being
chased by those Russian guys.

01:10:41.582 --> 01:10:43.664
We lost those losers ages ago.

01:10:43.665 --> 01:10:46.414
You hanging with the g-man
got us a good gig.

01:10:46.415 --> 01:10:49.748
I know I screwed up!
No, I had him, but I lost him.

01:10:49.749 --> 01:10:52.289
Amanda showed up early and blew my cover.

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:54.122
No, I didn't tell her who I...

01:10:54.123 --> 01:10:55.582
Of course I lied to her!

01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:59.289
No, look I'm pulling up
to the tent right now.

01:10:59.290 --> 01:11:01.582
If he's at this show,
I could bust him. Trust me.

01:11:09.956 --> 01:11:11.748
Hurry up. We're here.

01:11:11.749 --> 01:11:13.830
( gasps ) Marvelous.

01:11:13.831 --> 01:11:17.581
All right, you guys make your way
through the crowd, and get moving.

01:11:17.582 --> 01:11:21.914
Look, I have to find Strukov. I am
personally making sure you get out of here.

01:11:21.915 --> 01:11:23.623
Aw, gee, thanks Jim.

01:11:23.624 --> 01:11:26.290
But you do what's important to you.
I'll be fine on my own.

01:11:30.248 --> 01:11:31.499
( chattering )

01:11:33.332 --> 01:11:36.331
All right, this is the last one.
Make her beautiful.

01:11:36.332 --> 01:11:37.956
But I'm not a model, no.

01:11:49.998 --> 01:11:51.499
Let's get cracking, huh?

01:11:53.165 --> 01:11:55.247
Forget about the stupid models.

01:11:55.248 --> 01:11:58.872
Just get Winston and the Amanda
girl and get them out of here.

01:11:58.873 --> 01:12:01.080
And for Christ's sake, be discreet.

01:12:01.081 --> 01:12:03.790
Don't attract attention.

01:12:09.457 --> 01:12:10.873
( upbeat music playing )

01:12:12.873 --> 01:12:13.873
I look like Stevie Nicks!

01:12:18.998 --> 01:12:20.540
Hey! Where are you going?

01:12:23.207 --> 01:12:24.373
Holly.

01:12:27.248 --> 01:12:28.332
( screams )

01:12:33.873 --> 01:12:34.873
( grunts )

01:12:36.873 --> 01:12:38.207
( screams )

01:12:53.749 --> 01:12:54.873
( crowd gasps )

01:13:21.415 --> 01:13:22.915
( grunting )

01:13:25.415 --> 01:13:26.582
( screams )

01:13:40.915 --> 01:13:42.123
( gasps )

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:44.790
( grunts )

01:13:55.665 --> 01:13:56.956
( gasps )

01:14:03.915 --> 01:14:05.290
( feedback )

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.290
( loud creaking )

01:14:22.207 --> 01:14:23.623
( screaming )

01:14:23.624 --> 01:14:24.831
( gasps )

01:14:36.207 --> 01:14:37.499
Get off me!

01:14:39.332 --> 01:14:41.414
Move your hands.

01:14:41.415 --> 01:14:43.665
Amanda, trust me.

01:14:45.332 --> 01:14:46.664
( grunts )

01:14:46.665 --> 01:14:47.665
( shrieks )

01:14:49.165 --> 01:14:50.499
( applause )

01:14:53.749 --> 01:14:57.164
TELEVISION ANNOUNCER:
Leave it to Alfredo to
bring a sense of theater

01:14:57.165 --> 01:15:00.873
back to New York fashion with
his new slam-bang show tonight.

01:15:10.956 --> 01:15:14.539
I should've guessed if there was going
to be some sort of fashion fiasco,

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:16.706
that you girls would be
in the center of it.

01:15:16.707 --> 01:15:19.748
Listen, the only fashion fiasco
here is your haircut, sparky.

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:22.206
Yeah, that's real...
Pardon me, officer.

01:15:22.207 --> 01:15:26.206
Ladies, I want you to know that you'll
each be issued a special commendation

01:15:26.207 --> 01:15:29.539
for meritorious service
from the director of the FBI.

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:33.372
Agent Smoot says there's no way he could
have cracked this case without you.

01:15:33.373 --> 01:15:34.873
So, thank you.

01:15:37.873 --> 01:15:40.456
That's five separate commendations,

01:15:40.457 --> 01:15:42.122
if you can count that high.

01:15:42.123 --> 01:15:43.372
( chuckles )

01:15:43.373 --> 01:15:44.915
Bye-bye.

01:15:47.499 --> 01:15:49.122
Nice work, Smoot.

01:15:49.123 --> 01:15:50.749
Thanks, Megan.

01:15:54.457 --> 01:15:55.749
Can I talk to you?

01:15:57.248 --> 01:15:58.248
Yeah.

01:16:09.248 --> 01:16:11.247
I owe you an apology.

01:16:11.248 --> 01:16:12.415
I, uh...

01:16:15.915 --> 01:16:17.707
This is not the best place for this.

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.623
But, uh, listen...

01:16:21.624 --> 01:16:23.539
I'm sorry I lied to you.

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.623
But I'm not sorry I met you.

01:16:25.624 --> 01:16:27.623
Not at all.

01:16:27.624 --> 01:16:32.456
So I was hoping that you could forgive me.

01:16:32.457 --> 01:16:36.080
And, maybe, we could start over.

01:16:36.081 --> 01:16:37.457
What do you think?

01:16:44.332 --> 01:16:47.623
I, I don't know.
I just, um...

01:16:47.624 --> 01:16:50.955
I just ended this relationship
with some guy named Jim.

01:16:50.956 --> 01:16:53.915
Because he wasn't honest
with me from the beginning.

01:16:55.790 --> 01:17:01.039
I'm not really sure if I'm ready to
start a new one with whoever you are.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.748
Let's go, Smoot.

01:17:02.749 --> 01:17:05.123
We'll be filling out paperwork
for the rest of our lives.

01:17:35.998 --> 01:17:37.830
AMANDA: I know what you're thinking.

01:17:37.831 --> 01:17:39.499
And this time, you're right.

01:17:40.665 --> 01:17:43.206
I screwed up.

01:17:43.207 --> 01:17:47.039
By the time I realized it,
he was already gone.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.664
And now I can't find the one
guy I ever really cared about.

01:17:51.665 --> 01:17:53.707
Mandi.
Did you miss us?

01:17:55.081 --> 01:17:57.039
Hey, how was Palm Springs?

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.207
We just had the best time
at that Dinah Shore tourney.

01:18:02.749 --> 01:18:03.873
Oh, you finished.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.498
It's magnificent.
Yeah.

01:18:07.499 --> 01:18:10.164
Well, at least he was good for something.

01:18:10.165 --> 01:18:11.539
Have you talked to him?

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:15.456
No. His phone was
disconnected when he moved.

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:17.498
Not that I tried calling him or anything.

01:18:17.499 --> 01:18:19.247
He moved?
Yeah.

01:18:19.248 --> 01:18:22.499
It only took two movers, five hours
to pack and move everything.

01:18:23.707 --> 01:18:26.039
Not that I was watching.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.247
It's like he was never really there.

01:18:28.248 --> 01:18:30.039
Yeah.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.706
You know, I kind of don't want
this reminder for all of eternity.

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:35.039
I'm thinking of rubbing him out.

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.456
Oh, yeah. I agree.

01:18:36.457 --> 01:18:37.915
I think you better rub him out.

01:18:45.582 --> 01:18:46.915
( sighs )

01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:54.707
Amanda, admit it. You're not
ready to give up on him.

01:18:56.915 --> 01:18:59.372
Why does he only have one eye?

01:18:59.373 --> 01:19:02.748
That's because you're looking at
the side of his face. His profile.

01:19:02.749 --> 01:19:05.498
It makes him look like a fish.

01:19:05.499 --> 01:19:07.415
I know a lot about water, you know?

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:15.582
( whispers ) Mr. Fishtank.

01:19:30.457 --> 01:19:31.790
Jim?

01:19:50.373 --> 01:19:51.499
( barking )

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:55.499
JIM: Hamlet!

01:20:02.332 --> 01:20:04.165
Hi.
Hi.

01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:07.955
I just moved into the neighborhood.

01:20:07.956 --> 01:20:09.289
Where?

01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:11.414
A building that faces this one.

01:20:11.415 --> 01:20:13.289
It's got a great view.

01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:14.997
Sounds nice, I think.

01:20:14.998 --> 01:20:16.955
Do you want to come up and see it?

01:20:16.956 --> 01:20:20.789
( chuckles )
Oh, I don't know.
We just met.

01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:24.872
I'm Bob Smoot.
Amanda Pierce.

01:20:24.873 --> 01:20:27.830
You know, I've got to
be honest with you, Bob.

01:20:27.831 --> 01:20:30.955
I know. Smoot is a very strange name.

01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:32.873
It's good to be honest from the get-go.

01:20:34.248 --> 01:20:36.206
So, what's your line of work, Bob?

01:20:36.207 --> 01:20:37.789
That's funny you should ask.

01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:41.830
I just got promoted to a nice
boring desk job with the FBI.

01:20:41.831 --> 01:20:44.914
That's funny. You look a lot
like this guy I used to know.

01:20:44.915 --> 01:20:47.206
A good guy?
A great guy.

01:20:47.207 --> 01:20:48.997
But he's not as cute as you.

01:20:48.998 --> 01:20:50.331
( laughs )

01:20:50.332 --> 01:20:51.873
Come on.

01:20:54.665 --> 01:20:56.873
Come here.
Come over here.

01:20:58.749 --> 01:21:00.372
Wow.

01:21:00.373 --> 01:21:01.873
Look down there.

01:21:03.207 --> 01:21:04.914
Oh, my.

01:21:04.915 --> 01:21:07.414
( laughs ) Oh, my god.

01:21:07.415 --> 01:21:09.581
I told you I had a great view.

01:21:09.582 --> 01:21:12.997
You know, I heard you shouldn't
look into your neighbors' windows.

01:21:12.998 --> 01:21:14.414
It only leads to trouble.

01:21:14.415 --> 01:21:17.331
Well, you can't always believe what you see.

01:21:17.332 --> 01:21:21.707
A woman I used to know told me
sometimes you need to take a deeper look.

01:21:28.207 --> 01:21:29.915
Oh!
Whoa!

01:21:32.415 --> 01:21:35.706
Whoa. That's a weird feeling.

01:21:35.707 --> 01:21:37.872
See what I mean?

01:21:37.873 --> 01:21:39.415
Can we try that again?

01:21:40.873 --> 01:21:42.248
Definitely.

01:22:02.290 --> 01:22:05.122
BOB: Hey, can you do that
thing with your back?

01:22:05.123 --> 01:22:06.457
