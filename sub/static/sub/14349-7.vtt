00:19.386 --> 00:22.116
All sections--
security check in progress.

00:22.222 --> 00:23.120
Report.

00:23.223 --> 00:25.623
We're entering
standard orbit, Nurse.

00:25.725 --> 00:27.625
It won't be much longer.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.631
Forward scanner
to Bridge.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.998
I understand you gave up
a career in bio-research

00:37.103 --> 00:39.401
to sign aboard a starship.

00:39.506 --> 00:44.034
I know he's alive
down there, Captain.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.544
Scanner to Bridge,
Status report, please.

00:46.646 --> 00:49.513
It's been five years
since his last message.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.811
Roger's
a very determined man.

00:51.918 --> 00:54.182
He'd find a way to live.

00:54.287 --> 00:56.778
Beginning signals
to surface, sir.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.790
Put it on all
frequencies, Lieutenant.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.125
Ship's record banks show little
we don't already know

01:04.230 --> 01:05.595
about this planet,
Captain.

01:05.698 --> 01:07.598
Gravity is 1.1 of Earth.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.668
Atmosphere within
safety limits.

01:09.769 --> 01:12.670
But the surface temperature
of that planet

01:12.772 --> 01:14.672
is 100 degrees below 0.

01:14.774 --> 01:17.208
It may have been
inhabited once,

01:17.310 --> 01:18.709
but this system's sun

01:18.812 --> 01:22.111
has been fading steadily
for a half million years.

01:22.215 --> 01:25.446
Dr. Korby-- often called the Pasteur
of archaeological medicine.

01:25.552 --> 01:29.989
His translation of medical records
from the Orion ruins

01:30.090 --> 01:31.489
revolutionized
our immunization techniques.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.822
Required reading at
the academy, Mr. Spock.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.828
I've always wanted
to meet him.

01:36.930 --> 01:41.162
Do you think there's any chance
of him still being alive?

01:46.172 --> 01:49.073
I've tried all frequencies, sir.
No return signal.

01:49.175 --> 01:50.073
Keep trying.

01:51.544 --> 01:54.342
Warp capacity
.07 and building.

01:54.447 --> 01:58.406
Communicator, we need more lines
to the impulse deck.

02:00.186 --> 02:05.055
His last signal told about finding
underground caverns.

02:06.526 --> 02:11.156
And since then two expeditions have
failed to find him.

02:13.533 --> 02:16.934
I've run all frequencies
a second time. There's no--

02:17.036 --> 02:18.435
[Beep Beep]

02:18.538 --> 02:22.770
Enterprise, come in, Enterprise.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.901
This is Roger Korby.

02:25.011 --> 02:27.411
Repeating--
this is Dr. Roger Korby.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.142
Do you read me,
Enterprise?

02:30.250 --> 02:32.514
This is
Dr. Roger Korby...

02:32.619 --> 02:33.847
standing by.

02:41.861 --> 02:44.557
Space--
the final frontier.

02:46.232 --> 02:49.633
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

02:49.736 --> 02:51.135
Its five-year mission--

02:51.237 --> 02:54.764
to explore
strange new worlds...

02:54.874 --> 02:57.775
to seek out new life
and new civilizations...

02:59.078 --> 03:02.241
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.641
Captain's log,
Stardate 2712.4.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.378
A signal
from planet Exo-Ill.

03:40.486 --> 03:42.886
Dr. Roger Korby
has been located,

03:42.989 --> 03:45.822
he and part of his
expedition remaining alive

03:45.925 --> 03:48.826
due to the discovery
of underground ruins

03:48.928 --> 03:51.795
Ieft by the former
inhabitants of this world.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.297
Enterprise to Korby.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.798
We have
your coordinates.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.165
We're preparing
to beam down a party.

03:57.270 --> 04:00.000
It may interest you
that we have aboard--

04:00.106 --> 04:02.336
I've an unusual
request, Captain Kirk.

04:02.442 --> 04:04.342
Beam down alone,
just yourself.

04:04.444 --> 04:07.345
We've made discoveries
of such a nature

04:07.447 --> 04:10.211
they may require an extraordinary
decision from you.

04:13.353 --> 04:15.321
That's an unusual request.

04:16.623 --> 04:20.184
The man making it
is Dr. Roger Korby.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.020
You're certain
you'd recognize his voice?

04:24.130 --> 04:27.122
Have you ever been
engaged, Mr. Spock?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.162
Yes, it's Roger.

04:33.706 --> 04:34.604
Agreed, Doctor.

04:34.707 --> 04:37.608
However, there
will be two of us.

04:37.710 --> 04:38.699
Hello, Roger.

04:41.748 --> 04:42.646
Christine?

04:42.749 --> 04:43.647
Yes, Roger.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.650
Darling, how--
Where are you?

04:45.752 --> 04:47.652
Yes, by all means,
Captain.

04:47.754 --> 04:50.552
I--I had
no idea, no hope.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.557
Darling,
are you all right?

04:52.659 --> 04:53.557
Yes, Roger.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.958
Everything's
all right now.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.859
We're on our way,
Doctor.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.865
We'll be with you
in a moment.

05:00.967 --> 05:01.865
Enterprise out.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.416
Energize.

05:51.651 --> 05:54.211
He said he'd be waiting.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.582
Dr. Korby.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.486
Dr. Korby.

06:07.600 --> 06:12.003
It's possible we may have
hit the wrong entry point.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.504
Kirk to Enterprise.

06:13.606 --> 06:15.005
Spock here, Captain.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.838
Beam down...

06:17.944 --> 06:19.275
two security men.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.710
Any problems,
Captain?

06:20.813 --> 06:22.644
Some delay
in meeting us.

06:22.749 --> 06:25.149
Probably nothing at all.
Kirk out.

06:26.619 --> 06:28.644
Corridors could be
quite deep.

06:33.126 --> 06:37.028
Getting here may have taken
more time than he estimated.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.028
Don't worry.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.029
Thank you.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.811
Rayburn,
maintain post here.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.073
Yes, sir.

06:55.181 --> 06:57.809
Mathews, we'll look for
Dr. Korby. Accompany us.

06:57.917 --> 06:58.815
Yes, sir.

08:00.279 --> 08:01.371
Aah!

08:38.618 --> 08:40.643
Is that you,
Dr. Korby?

08:44.924 --> 08:46.824
Dr. Brown!
It's Roger's assistant.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.518
Brownie, where's Roger?

08:48.628 --> 08:53.224
Aah!

08:54.467 --> 08:56.958
Be careful.

08:57.069 --> 08:59.469
Is there
a path down there?

08:59.572 --> 09:01.631
There's no hope, Captain.
It's bottomless.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.140
He must have slipped.

09:03.242 --> 09:06.040
[Kirk]
Any chance of a projection or a ledge?

09:06.145 --> 09:07.043
None, Captain.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.485
Unfortunate.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.583
Terribly unfortunate.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.093
Dr. Korby was detained.

09:23.195 --> 09:26.096
I came
as soon as I could.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.329
Not soon enough.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.935
Brownie,

09:33.039 --> 09:34.438
what is it?

09:34.540 --> 09:36.007
Explain.

09:36.108 --> 09:37.769
Don't you recognize me?

09:40.379 --> 09:42.108
Christine,

09:42.214 --> 09:44.182
you look well.

09:44.283 --> 09:47.184
My name is Brown,
Dr. Korby's assistant.

09:47.286 --> 09:49.754
I presume
you are Captain Kirk.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.026
He's dead.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.289
I assure you.

09:58.397 --> 09:59.295
Come.

09:59.398 --> 10:02.026
Dr. Korby
will be waiting.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.261
You do know him well?

10:04.370 --> 10:05.632
An old friend?

10:07.640 --> 10:11.940
I suppose living here
for five years...

10:21.153 --> 10:23.053
Captain Kirk to Rayburn.
Report.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.646
All quiet here
at the entry, Captain.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.056
Any problems there, sir?

10:28.160 --> 10:31.561
We lost Mathews.
Apparently an accident.

10:33.666 --> 10:37.932
Tell the Enterprise to have
a full security party standing by.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.937
Yes, sir.

10:40.039 --> 10:43.270
[Kirk]
And we'll both report
in at hourly intervals.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.571
If you and I
lose contact,

10:45.678 --> 10:49.774
or if he fails to hear
from either of us,

10:49.882 --> 10:53.409
he's to beam the security party
down immediately. Kirk out.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.259
Dr. Korby has discovered

11:02.361 --> 11:04.261
that as their sun dimmed,

11:04.363 --> 11:07.264
the inhabitants of this planet
moved underground

11:07.366 --> 11:10.529
from an open environment
to this dark world.

11:10.636 --> 11:13.537
When you were
a student of his, Christine,

11:13.639 --> 11:16.540
you must have often
heard Dr. Korby remark

11:16.642 --> 11:21.477
how freedom of movement and choice
produced the human spirit.

11:22.648 --> 11:25.549
The culture of Exo-Ill
proved his theory.

11:25.651 --> 11:29.553
When they moved
from light to darkness,

11:29.655 --> 11:34.558
they replaced freedom
with a mechanistic culture.

11:34.660 --> 11:38.562
Dr. Korby has been able
to uncover elements of this culture

11:38.664 --> 11:41.565
which will revolutionize
the universe

11:41.667 --> 11:44.101
when freed from
this cavernous environment.

12:16.368 --> 12:19.030
I'm Andrea.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.504
You must be Christine.

12:21.607 --> 12:24.940
I've always thought how
beautiful your name is.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.682
And you
must be Captain Kirk

12:32.785 --> 12:35.049
of the Starship
Enterprise.

12:35.154 --> 12:38.612
We appreciate you bringing Roger's
fiancee to him.

12:38.724 --> 12:42.421
I don't remember Dr. Korby
mentioning an Andrea.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.465
But you are exactly
as Roger described you.

12:47.566 --> 12:49.761
No wonder
he missed you so.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.268
Where is Dr. Korby?

12:51.370 --> 12:52.268
Here, Captain.

12:54.673 --> 12:56.072
I, uh...

12:56.175 --> 12:58.006
I've been looking
forward to--

13:16.328 --> 13:19.320
Oh, I knew
I'd find you.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.831
Everything's
all right now.

13:27.773 --> 13:28.967
Oh.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.042
Forgive me, Captain.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.544
I'm, uh, I'm Roger Korby.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.979
There's no need
to apologize, sir,

13:37.082 --> 13:39.414
and certainly no need
to introduce yourself.

13:39.518 --> 13:42.112
The captain lost
a man in the caverns.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.916
What?

13:44.023 --> 13:45.320
How did it happen?

13:45.424 --> 13:48.120
The pit near
the outer junction.

13:48.227 --> 13:50.627
The edge
must have given way.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.128
I'm terribly sorry,
Captain.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.131
Perhaps
if I'd been there--

13:54.233 --> 13:56.565
I know the passages
so well.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.068
It wasn't your fault.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.569
Kirk to Rayburn. Report.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.867
I'm required to make
a security confirmation.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.373
If you list
your personnel,

14:03.475 --> 14:05.375
cargo requirements,
any special needs--

14:05.477 --> 14:06.876
Captain,
I'd much prefer--

14:06.979 --> 14:08.378
Rayburn,
are you receiving?

14:08.480 --> 14:11.381
I'd prefer you waited
till I've talked to you.

14:11.483 --> 14:15.180
I've lost contact with my guard.
I must call my ship.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.585
No communications,
Captain.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.748
[Christine]
Roger.

14:18.858 --> 14:19.790
I'm sorry.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.554
If they should send
down more people,

14:22.661 --> 14:23.559
Roger, that--

14:23.662 --> 14:25.892
He won't be harmed.
I promise.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.058
Isn't it possible there
could be things here

14:29.168 --> 14:31.159
unknown to you
so important--

14:31.270 --> 14:32.931
Sir, one man's dead.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.939
I've lost contact
with the other.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.599
Andrea.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.314
What are you doing?

14:42.414 --> 14:44.473
This is necessary,
Captain.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.312
You will understand.

14:46.418 --> 14:47.976
Andrea.

15:05.537 --> 15:06.663
Drop it!

15:18.484 --> 15:19.917
[Christine]
ohh!

15:31.430 --> 15:34.831
Enterprise from Captain Kirk.
Come in. Do you read?

15:35.968 --> 15:37.799
Frequency open,
Mr. Spock.

15:38.904 --> 15:40.303
Spock here, Captain.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.306
Contact established
with Dr. Korby.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.308
We were becoming
concerned, Captain.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.741
Your check-in was overdue,

15:45.844 --> 15:49.075
and since we'd not heard
from your security team--

15:49.181 --> 15:50.478
No problem, Mr. Spock.

15:50.582 --> 15:53.073
[Kirk's Voice]
We'll return to the ship
within 48 hours.

15:53.185 --> 15:56.746
Dr. Korby's records and specimens
will require careful packing.

15:58.590 --> 16:02.026
Captain, are you all right?
You sound tired.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.652
If you cry out,
Ruk may injure you.

16:04.763 --> 16:07.425
At least wait
until we can talk.

16:07.533 --> 16:10.434
[Spock]
Acknowledge, Captain.
Is everything all right?

16:10.536 --> 16:11.935
Fine, Mr. Spock.

16:12.037 --> 16:15.666
Dr. Korby has made some
fascinating discoveries.

16:15.774 --> 16:17.139
All under control.

16:17.242 --> 16:20.803
Stand by for regular contact.
Kirk out.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.814
This is not
a vain display, Captain.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.315
I'm a scientist.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.647
You obviously know
my reputation.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.448
Trust me.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.989
Yes, I know
your reputation.

16:32.091 --> 16:36.494
The whole galaxy knows who you are
and what you stand for.

16:36.595 --> 16:39.291
That's why all this
makes no sense.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.628
There's so much
you must learn

16:41.734 --> 16:44.134
Before you make
a final judgment.

16:44.236 --> 16:45.225
For example...

16:46.472 --> 16:47.666
Andrea.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.172
[Andrea's Voice]
You must be Captain Kirk

16:53.278 --> 16:56.179
of the Starship
Enterprise.

16:59.852 --> 17:04.050
[Korby's Voice]
Christine, it's all right now.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.623
You see, Captain?

17:05.723 --> 17:07.089
[Christine's Voice]
Yes, Roger.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.922
Everything
is all right now.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.190
That's enough.

17:12.297 --> 17:14.492
You are not
to mock Christine.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.363
You will
never harm her.

17:16.468 --> 17:19.130
Or disobey
an order from her.

17:20.539 --> 17:24.167
You will not disobey
her orders.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.175
Satisfied,
Captain Kirk?

17:26.278 --> 17:29.679
Both love and trust.

17:29.782 --> 17:33.115
Now give me 24 hours
to convince you.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.381
Do I need to be a prisoner
to be convinced?

17:36.488 --> 17:40.891
What would your first duty be
upon return to your vessel?

17:40.993 --> 17:44.895
Report. Do you realize the discoveries
lost because of superstition?

17:44.997 --> 17:48.694
Of ignorance? Of a layman's
inability to comprehend?

17:48.801 --> 17:52.202
A simple layman's
question, Doctor--

17:57.242 --> 17:59.767
Where is
my other crewman?

17:59.878 --> 18:01.311
Alive?

18:01.413 --> 18:02.471
Dead?

18:02.581 --> 18:05.482
Ruk was programmed
to protect my experiments.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.815
The logic of his machine
mind saw danger to me.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.513
Where's my other crewman?

18:10.622 --> 18:13.591
Ruk destroyed them both,

18:13.692 --> 18:16.593
but totally against my wishes,
I assure you.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.429
He's an android...
Iike Brown?

18:23.635 --> 18:27.298
More complex than Brown.

18:27.406 --> 18:30.307
Much superior.

18:30.409 --> 18:33.867
I was left here
by the old ones.

18:33.979 --> 18:37.881
Ruk was still tending the machinery
when we arrived here.

18:37.983 --> 18:39.678
How many centuries?

18:41.553 --> 18:44.522
Even Ruk doesn't know.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.592
With his help, with the records
I could find,

18:47.693 --> 18:49.092
we built Brown.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.196
You've convinced me,
Doctor.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.766
You've convinced me
that you're dangerous.

19:00.439 --> 19:01.770
[Crash]

19:04.076 --> 19:05.543
Ruk, no!

19:15.320 --> 19:17.220
I do not understand.

19:22.761 --> 19:24.661
Why are you unhappy?

19:24.763 --> 19:27.357
You are
with Roger again.

19:27.466 --> 19:28.990
Where is Captain Kirk?

19:36.275 --> 19:38.675
You are concerned
about the captain?

19:38.777 --> 19:40.540
Yes, I am concerned.

19:43.315 --> 19:47.308
How can you love Roger
without trusting him?

19:49.788 --> 19:54.191
Why does it bother you when
I use the name Roger?

19:54.293 --> 19:56.158
Andrea,

19:56.261 --> 20:00.755
it's sufficient that
it does disturb her.

20:00.866 --> 20:05.269
You will call me Dr. Korby
from now on, Andrea.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.803
Yes, Dr. Korby.

20:08.807 --> 20:11.708
I didn't mean
to eavesdrop, darling.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.710
As you can see, uh,

20:13.812 --> 20:16.246
Captain Kirk is fine.
He won't be harmed.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.248
The things at stake here

20:18.350 --> 20:22.548
simply make it necessary
he doesn't report to his ship.

20:22.654 --> 20:25.122
I need time to explain
and demonstrate...

20:25.224 --> 20:27.124
to him and to you.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.821
Now shall
we start with Andrea?

20:30.929 --> 20:33.454
Yes, let's
start with Andrea.

20:38.837 --> 20:42.102
I'm like Dr. Brown--
an android.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.811
Didn't you know?

20:50.749 --> 20:53.616
Remarkable, isn't she?

20:54.820 --> 20:55.718
Notice the--

20:55.821 --> 20:57.152
the lifelike
pigmentation,

20:57.256 --> 21:00.191
the variation
in skin tones.

21:00.292 --> 21:03.693
The flesh--
The flesh has warmth.

21:03.795 --> 21:05.319
There's even a pulse,

21:05.430 --> 21:07.421
Physical sensation.

21:07.532 --> 21:09.056
How convenient.

21:10.802 --> 21:12.326
Christine,

21:12.437 --> 21:15.338
you must realize an android's
like a computer.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.840
It does only
what I program.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.571
As a scientist,
you must realize--

21:20.679 --> 21:22.579
that given
a mechanical Dr. Brown,

21:22.681 --> 21:25.241
a mechanical geisha would be
no more difficult.

21:25.350 --> 21:27.181
You think I could love
a machine?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.913
Did you?

21:30.656 --> 21:32.715
Andrea's incapable
of that.

21:32.824 --> 21:34.223
She simply obeys orders.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.726
She has
no meaning for me.

21:36.828 --> 21:39.456
There's
no emotional bond.

21:39.564 --> 21:41.555
Andrea...

21:41.667 --> 21:43.931
Kiss, uh, Captain Kirk.

21:51.009 --> 21:52.909
Now strike him.

21:54.179 --> 21:56.238
You see?

21:56.348 --> 21:59.681
There's no emotion in it,
no emotional involvement.

21:59.785 --> 22:01.878
She simply responds
to orders.

22:01.987 --> 22:05.423
She's a totally
logical computer,

22:05.524 --> 22:06.422
a thing.

22:06.525 --> 22:09.153
Not a woman.

22:10.395 --> 22:13.387
Now do you understand?

22:13.498 --> 22:16.592
If these mechanical
things have no feelings

22:16.702 --> 22:19.603
and perform only
as you program them,

22:19.705 --> 22:22.674
then why did Brown
try to shoot me?

22:22.774 --> 22:25.174
Why did he kill
two of my men?

22:25.277 --> 22:28.542
There are many things I don't
understand, Doctor.

22:28.647 --> 22:31.480
I will answer all of
your questions...now.

22:50.235 --> 22:53.227
This is how
you make an android.

22:54.906 --> 22:55.804
[Machine Beeps]

23:03.348 --> 23:04.508
Andrea.

23:31.176 --> 23:33.076
[Low Rumbling]

23:37.949 --> 23:39.814
He's not being harmed.

23:39.918 --> 23:40.816
I promise.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.130
Roger,
what's happened to you?

23:54.232 --> 23:56.530
When I sat
in your class,

23:56.635 --> 23:59.968
you wouldn't even dream of harming
an insect or an animal.

24:00.071 --> 24:03.563
Their life was
sacred to you then.

24:13.485 --> 24:16.386
If I'd simply beamed up
to their vessel

24:16.488 --> 24:18.388
with Brown
and the others,

24:18.490 --> 24:20.856
I'd have given them
objects of curiosity,

24:20.959 --> 24:23.792
beginnings of wild stories,
foolish theories.

24:37.909 --> 24:38.898
Ruk!

24:40.812 --> 24:42.143
[High-Pitched Squealing]

24:42.247 --> 24:44.078
Now watch carefully.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.601
Choose, Christine.

25:40.071 --> 25:41.902
Which is your captain?

25:49.214 --> 25:50.681
I don't know.

25:52.017 --> 25:53.416
They're exact.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.511
I honestly don't know.

25:57.622 --> 25:59.590
Synthetic organs
are in place.

25:59.691 --> 26:01.090
We merely
synchronize them

26:01.192 --> 26:03.092
with Kirk's autonomic
nervous system,

26:03.194 --> 26:05.958
duplicating the rhythms
of his body.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.429
At the same time,

26:07.532 --> 26:09.397
we duplicate
the mental pattern.

26:10.702 --> 26:12.101
Now...

26:12.203 --> 26:14.103
physical pattern
complete,

26:14.205 --> 26:16.605
we now make
a mental pattern.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.103
Ready for final
synaptic fusion.

26:24.215 --> 26:27.616
Andrea, stand by
for cortex circuits.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.120
The android
will be so perfect,

26:31.222 --> 26:33.122
It could even
replace the captain.

26:33.224 --> 26:35.624
The same memories,
the same attitudes,

26:35.727 --> 26:37.627
the same abilities.

26:40.231 --> 26:41.926
Activate circuits.

26:42.033 --> 26:44.126
Mind your own business,
Mr. Spock.

26:44.235 --> 26:46.635
I'm sick of your
half-breed interference.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.569
Mind your own business,
Mr. Spock.

26:48.673 --> 26:50.072
I'm sick of your--

26:50.175 --> 26:52.439
[Buzz]

26:59.451 --> 27:02.579
[Static]

27:17.702 --> 27:18.964
Complete.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.266
Are you all right?

27:24.542 --> 27:26.032
As far as I know.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.112
Now...

27:28.213 --> 27:29.805
Meet an android.

27:37.222 --> 27:39.417
How do you do,
Miss Chapel?

27:53.171 --> 27:56.572
I am now programmed
to please you also.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.575
Is the food
appealing?

28:01.179 --> 28:02.578
Yes, thank you.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.585
Please sit,
Captain.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.655
Thank you.

28:10.755 --> 28:13.588
I'm more or less
on parole, I understand.

28:13.692 --> 28:17.093
Dr. Korby suggested
that you have lunch.

28:17.195 --> 28:21.791
He thought you might have
a few things to talk about.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.100
Captain...

28:25.203 --> 28:26.602
I know, I know.

28:26.705 --> 28:30.664
I'd hate to be torn between
commander and fiancee myself.

28:30.775 --> 28:33.107
No, I'm not torn.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.111
I'm puzzled.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.373
I'm worried.

28:36.481 --> 28:37.880
Has he confided in you?

28:37.982 --> 28:39.415
Nothing
he hasn't told you.

28:39.517 --> 28:42.145
I know
it doesn't make sense.

28:42.253 --> 28:45.154
What he's done
may seem wrong,

28:45.256 --> 28:47.588
but he is Roger Korby,

28:47.692 --> 28:50.092
whatever
he seems to be doing.

28:50.195 --> 28:53.096
Unless something's
gone wrong with his mind.

28:53.198 --> 28:56.099
No. You're forgetting
how well I know him.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.328
He's as sane as us.

29:01.206 --> 29:02.298
Nurse...

29:02.407 --> 29:06.605
if I gave you a direct order
to betray him...

29:08.213 --> 29:09.111
Please.

29:09.214 --> 29:12.115
Don't ask me
to make that choice.

29:12.217 --> 29:15.618
I'd rather you push me off
the same precipice

29:15.720 --> 29:17.119
where Mathews died.

29:21.226 --> 29:22.659
Oh, no, I can't.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.661
Please,
go ahead and eat.

29:27.732 --> 29:29.632
Androids don't eat,
Miss Chapel.

29:32.871 --> 29:34.896
Even has
your sense of humor.

29:50.989 --> 29:53.150
There's one difference
between us--I'm hungry.

29:53.258 --> 29:56.022
The difference is your weakness,
Captain, not mine.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.027
One at a time,
gentlemen.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.061
Captain?

29:59.164 --> 30:01.155
Eating is a pleasure,
sir.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.666
Unfortunately,
one you will never know.

30:03.768 --> 30:06.669
Perhaps, but I will
never starve, sir.

30:08.273 --> 30:09.638
He's an exact duplicate?

30:09.741 --> 30:11.208
In every detail.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.174
What about memory?

30:13.278 --> 30:14.870
Tell me about Sam.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.674
George Samuel Kirk,
your brother.

30:16.781 --> 30:18.544
Only you call him Sam.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.483
He saw me off
on this mission.

30:21.586 --> 30:23.850
Yes, with his wife
and three sons.

30:25.857 --> 30:28.189
He said he was
being transferred

30:28.293 --> 30:30.693
to Earth colony 2
research station.

30:30.795 --> 30:33.696
No, Captain. He said he was
continuing his research.

30:33.798 --> 30:37.325
He wanted to be transferred
to Earth colony 2.

30:37.435 --> 30:40.404
It's like outthinking
a calculating machine.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.200
Obviously, I can't...

30:44.309 --> 30:48.177
but we do have some
interesting differences.

30:48.279 --> 30:51.146
Totally
unimportant ones.

30:51.249 --> 30:52.648
You may leave now.

31:00.258 --> 31:03.159
You haven't guessed
the rest, hmm?

31:04.762 --> 31:06.389
Not even you,
Christine?

31:08.399 --> 31:12.165
What you saw
was only a machine,

31:12.270 --> 31:15.171
Only half of what I
could've accomplished,

31:15.273 --> 31:16.900
Do you understand?

31:17.008 --> 31:18.669
By continuing the process,

31:18.776 --> 31:22.177
I could've transferred you,
your very consciousness

31:22.280 --> 31:23.679
into that android,

31:23.781 --> 31:26.113
your soul, if you wish.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.777
All of you.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.184
In android form,

31:30.288 --> 31:33.689
a human being can have
practical immortality.

31:33.791 --> 31:36.385
Can you understand
what I'm offering mankind?

31:36.494 --> 31:37.461
Programming.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.429
Different word, but
the same old promises

31:40.531 --> 31:44.126
made by Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar,
Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis.

31:44.235 --> 31:47.636
Can you understand that a human
converted to an android

31:47.739 --> 31:49.639
can be programmed
for the better?

31:49.741 --> 31:52.141
Can you imagine
how life could be improved

31:52.243 --> 31:55.235
if we could do away with
jealousy, greed, hate?

31:55.346 --> 31:59.146
It can also be improved by eliminating
love, tenderness, sentiment,

31:59.250 --> 32:01.775
the other side
of the coin, Doctor.

32:01.886 --> 32:04.150
No one
need ever die again.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.654
No disease,

32:05.757 --> 32:07.156
No deformities.

32:07.258 --> 32:10.159
Why, even fear
can be programmed away,

32:10.261 --> 32:11.660
replaced with joy.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.664
I'm offering you
a practical heaven,

32:14.766 --> 32:16.165
a new paradise,

32:16.267 --> 32:19.430
and all I need
is your help.

32:19.537 --> 32:22.836
All you wanted before
was my understanding.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.842
I need transportation
to a planet colony

32:25.944 --> 32:27.502
with proper
raw materials.

32:27.612 --> 32:31.446
There are several good possibilities
among your next stops.

32:31.549 --> 32:33.449
No diversion
from your route.

32:33.551 --> 32:35.678
I want
no suspicions aroused.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.052
I'll begin producing
androids carefully, selectively.

32:39.157 --> 32:40.181
Yes.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.189
Yes.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.691
No one need know,

32:42.794 --> 32:44.853
only to frighten
uninformed minds.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.625
They must be strongly infiltrated
into society

32:47.732 --> 32:49.791
before the android existence
is revealed.

32:49.901 --> 32:54.235
I want no hysteria to destroy
what is good and right.

32:55.807 --> 32:56.933
You with me, Captain?

32:58.242 --> 33:01.177
You've created
your own Kirk.

33:01.279 --> 33:03.543
Why do you need me?

33:03.648 --> 33:06.048
I created him
to impress you,

33:06.150 --> 33:07.811
not to replace you.

33:07.919 --> 33:10.820
I'm impressed, Doctor...

33:10.922 --> 33:13.584
but not the way
you think!

33:14.692 --> 33:15.659
Stand back, Ruk!

33:15.760 --> 33:17.159
I'll kill him!

33:20.765 --> 33:21.663
Stay back.

33:39.784 --> 33:40.682
Ruk...

33:40.785 --> 33:42.184
protect!

33:46.791 --> 33:47.815
Roger, l...

34:00.905 --> 34:01.803
Ruk!

34:01.906 --> 34:03.134
No!

34:06.244 --> 34:07.643
[Nurse Chapel]
Ruk, stop!

34:07.745 --> 34:11.647
Dr. Korby said
you are to obey me!

34:11.748 --> 34:12.647
Ruk!

34:14.752 --> 34:15.650
Ruk!

34:22.260 --> 34:26.161
Ruk, I order you
not to harm him!

35:08.973 --> 35:09.871
[Snap]

35:16.747 --> 35:19.147
[Christine's Voice]
Captain Kirk!

35:19.250 --> 35:21.013
Where are you?

35:28.259 --> 35:29.658
Captain Kirk!

35:29.760 --> 35:31.660
I can help you!

35:34.465 --> 35:36.433
Christine,
is that you?

36:56.214 --> 36:57.112
Captain!

37:05.223 --> 37:07.123
Captain...

37:07.225 --> 37:08.624
We finished
ahead of schedule.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.129
Dr. Korby has considerable cargo
to beam aboard.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.631
I'll have to go over
our destination schedule.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.633
You're going back down?

37:17.735 --> 37:19.635
Mind your own business,
Mr. Spock.

37:19.737 --> 37:23.639
I'm sick of your half-breed
interference, do you hear?

37:23.741 --> 37:25.140
Yes, very well,
Captain.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.143
You look upset,
Mr. Spock.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.143
Is everything
all right?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.645
No problems here, sir.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.146
Good.
I'll beam up shortly

37:31.249 --> 37:33.149
with Dr. Korby
and party.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.599
Security, Spock here.

37:50.701 --> 37:52.100
Status of
the landing party.

37:52.203 --> 37:53.602
Ready
and standing by, sir,

37:53.704 --> 37:55.604
Meet me in
the transporter room

37:55.706 --> 37:58.106
after the captain
has beamed down.

37:59.710 --> 38:01.109
I looked it over.

38:01.212 --> 38:05.615
I think you'll find planet Midas Five
an excellent choice.

38:05.716 --> 38:07.616
A small colony.

38:07.718 --> 38:10.118
Abundant raw materials.

38:10.221 --> 38:12.121
You made a good beginning,
Captain.

38:12.223 --> 38:13.622
Thank you.

38:13.724 --> 38:16.625
I felt quite at home
on the Enterprise.

38:25.236 --> 38:26.134
Andrea...

38:32.243 --> 38:33.141
kiss me.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.110
No.

39:08.212 --> 39:10.612
Not programmed
for you.

39:23.227 --> 39:25.127
What's the matter,
Andrea?

39:25.229 --> 39:26.628
Confused?

39:30.234 --> 39:31.132
No.

39:39.243 --> 39:40.540
Emotion, Ruk?

39:44.248 --> 39:48.480
You disapprove of Miss Chapel's orders
to save my life.

39:48.586 --> 39:54.024
To maintain your existence
would be illogical.

39:54.125 --> 39:55.456
Why?

39:55.559 --> 40:00.121
Can't your memory banks solve
a simple equation like that?

40:02.133 --> 40:05.034
What happened...

40:05.136 --> 40:09.539
to the old ones,
Ruk?

40:09.640 --> 40:11.631
It's so long ago.

40:11.742 --> 40:15.644
Is it possible they built
their machines too well...

40:18.649 --> 40:20.549
gave them pride

40:20.651 --> 40:22.551
and a desire to survive?

40:22.653 --> 40:24.553
Machines that wanted
logic and order

40:24.655 --> 40:26.555
and found that
frustrated

40:26.657 --> 40:29.558
by the illogical emotional creatures
that built them?

40:29.660 --> 40:30.558
Yes.

40:30.661 --> 40:32.060
The old ones.

40:32.163 --> 40:35.064
The ones
who made us.

40:35.166 --> 40:38.567
They grew fearful
of us.

40:38.669 --> 40:41.069
They began
to turn us off.

40:41.172 --> 40:43.072
Isn't it Korby
who's creating

40:43.174 --> 40:45.972
the same danger to you
all over again?

40:46.076 --> 40:49.409
Unlike you, we humans are full of
unpredictable emotions

40:49.513 --> 40:51.606
that logic cannot solve.

40:51.715 --> 40:53.012
Yes.

40:53.117 --> 40:57.019
Yes. It had been so long ago,
I had forgotten.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.520
The old ones here.

40:58.622 --> 41:01.022
The ones
who made us, yes.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.026
Yes, it is still
in my memory banks.

41:04.128 --> 41:08.030
It became necessary
to destroy them.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.293
You are inconsistent.

41:10.401 --> 41:13.029
You cannot
be programmed.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.332
You are inferior.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.040
And Korby?

41:19.143 --> 41:21.043
You came
from the outside.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.544
You bring disorder here.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.045
The danger to you
is Korby.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.547
I was programmed
by Korby.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.048
I cannot harm him.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.051
The old ones
programmed you, too,

41:29.153 --> 41:31.553
but it became possible
to destroy them.

41:31.655 --> 41:34.055
That was the equation!

41:34.158 --> 41:35.557
Ugh!

41:35.659 --> 41:37.559
Existence!

41:37.661 --> 41:42.564
Survival must
cancel out programming.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.566
That's it, Ruk!
Logic!

41:44.668 --> 41:46.568
You can't
protect someone

41:46.670 --> 41:48.069
who's trying
to destroy you!

41:48.172 --> 41:49.537
Ruk, I would like--

41:53.010 --> 41:56.502
You brought him among us.

41:56.614 --> 41:59.412
You brought
the inferior ones.

41:59.517 --> 42:03.283
We had cleansed ourselves
of them.

42:03.387 --> 42:06.413
Now you bring
the evil back!

42:06.524 --> 42:08.321
Ruk, stop!

42:10.327 --> 42:11.453
Your programming.

42:29.146 --> 42:30.545
I had no choice.

42:43.027 --> 42:45.052
You were a man with respect
for all things alive.

42:45.162 --> 42:47.995
How can I explain
the change in you?

42:48.098 --> 42:52.000
If I told Earth
I was in your hands--

42:58.108 --> 42:59.803
[Static]

43:14.592 --> 43:16.526
It's still me,
Christine.

43:16.627 --> 43:18.026
Roger.

43:20.130 --> 43:21.529
I'm in here.

43:23.434 --> 43:26.028
You can't imagine
how it was.

43:26.136 --> 43:28.536
I was frozen...

43:28.639 --> 43:30.106
Dying.

43:30.207 --> 43:32.300
My legs were gone.

43:32.409 --> 43:33.398
I was...

43:33.510 --> 43:36.479
I had only my brain
between life and death.

43:39.883 --> 43:42.545
This can be repaired--

43:42.653 --> 43:46.054
easier than another man
can set a broken finger.

43:46.156 --> 43:49.489
I'm still the same
as I was before, Christine,

43:49.593 --> 43:51.356
perhaps even better.

43:54.598 --> 43:56.065
Are you, Roger?

43:57.601 --> 43:59.501
[Alarm Beeping]

44:06.110 --> 44:07.008
Andrea.

44:07.111 --> 44:08.043
Yes, Doctor.

44:08.145 --> 44:10.511
There's someone
in the outer junction.

44:10.614 --> 44:11.512
Spock.

44:11.615 --> 44:13.515
He must've
got my message.

44:13.617 --> 44:14.845
I will find Ruk.

44:14.952 --> 44:17.318
He'll never find us
in this maze.

44:17.421 --> 44:18.649
Ruk has been shut off.

44:18.756 --> 44:21.020
Get a weapon.
Deal with it.

44:21.125 --> 44:22.023
Protect.

44:37.641 --> 44:39.040
I will kiss you.

44:39.143 --> 44:40.269
No.

44:40.377 --> 44:42.038
You...

44:42.146 --> 44:44.239
You will not?

44:44.348 --> 44:46.213
It is illogical.

44:52.289 --> 44:53.984
I'm the same!

44:54.091 --> 44:55.991
A direct transfer.

44:56.093 --> 44:57.492
All of me,

44:57.594 --> 44:59.494
human, rational,
and without a flaw.

44:59.596 --> 45:01.496
He freed himself,
and I destroyed--

45:03.067 --> 45:04.500
Destroyed him.

45:12.609 --> 45:16.511
I'm...not programmed
for alarms.

45:16.613 --> 45:19.514
I listened
to your instructions.

45:19.616 --> 45:21.015
They were misstated.

45:21.118 --> 45:24.019
She killed the android
like you killed Ruk.

45:24.121 --> 45:27.522
Is this
your perfect world,

45:27.624 --> 45:31.526
your flawless beings
killing off one another?

45:31.628 --> 45:34.028
Aren't you doing exactly
what you hate in humans,

45:34.131 --> 45:36.531
killing with no more concern
than turning off a light?

45:36.633 --> 45:38.533
I'm not a computer.

45:40.137 --> 45:41.536
Test me.

45:41.638 --> 45:43.538
Ask me to solve
any--

45:47.144 --> 45:47.974
Equate--

45:51.081 --> 45:51.979
Transmi--

45:57.454 --> 45:59.979
Christine,
Christine,

46:00.090 --> 46:02.422
Iet me prove myself.

46:02.526 --> 46:05.324
Does this make
such a difference?

46:05.429 --> 46:07.488
Don't you see, Roger?

46:07.598 --> 46:10.761
Everything you've done
has proved it isn't you.

46:10.868 --> 46:14.429
I am Roger Korby!

46:14.538 --> 46:15.800
Then prove it.

46:17.474 --> 46:19.499
Give me that phaser gun.

46:19.610 --> 46:22.010
If there's any human
left in you,

46:22.112 --> 46:23.511
give it to me.

46:23.614 --> 46:24.512
No.

46:24.615 --> 46:27.516
You will
never understand.

46:27.618 --> 46:30.018
I constructed
a perfect being,

46:30.120 --> 46:32.520
tested it,

46:32.623 --> 46:34.523
proved it.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.525
Proved it.

46:38.629 --> 46:39.527
Proved it.

46:54.578 --> 46:56.478
Andrea,
give me the weapon.

46:56.580 --> 46:57.979
No. Protect.

47:01.084 --> 47:01.982
Protect.

47:10.093 --> 47:11.993
To love you.

47:13.597 --> 47:15.497
To...

47:15.599 --> 47:17.499
To...

47:17.601 --> 47:18.625
kiss you.

47:18.735 --> 47:19.997
No.

47:20.103 --> 47:22.003
You cannot love.

47:25.108 --> 47:27.576
You're not human.

47:27.678 --> 47:30.511
Love you...

47:30.614 --> 47:32.514
Kiss...

47:45.128 --> 47:46.527
Captain Kirk!

47:50.567 --> 47:51.966
In here, Spock.

47:55.572 --> 47:57.472
Captain,
are you all right?

47:57.574 --> 47:58.973
Nurse?

48:00.544 --> 48:01.943
Where's Dr. Korby?

48:06.550 --> 48:09.451
Dr. Korby...

48:09.553 --> 48:10.952
was never here.

48:34.478 --> 48:37.879
Thank you for letting me make
the decision, Captain.

48:37.981 --> 48:40.882
I'm quite certain I'm
doing the right thing.

48:40.984 --> 48:43.384
She's staying
with the ship.

48:45.856 --> 48:48.450
Something bothering you,
Mr. Spock?

48:48.558 --> 48:52.016
Frankly,
I was rather dismayed

48:52.129 --> 48:54.996
by your use of the term
"half-breed," Captain.

48:56.767 --> 49:00.032
You must admit it is
an unsophisticated expression.

49:00.137 --> 49:02.435
I'll remember that,
Mr. Spock,

49:02.539 --> 49:10.947
the next time I find myself
in a similar situation.

49:11.048 --> 49:13.676
Steady as we go, helm.
