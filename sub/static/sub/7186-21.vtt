01:08.268 --> 01:09.334
Great!

01:09.336 --> 01:10.903
To start today's adventure,

the Pirate Password.

Yo-ho-ho!

01:15.509 --> 01:17.509

[yawns] It's time to get up.

01:34.929 --> 01:38.864
Mateys, all hands on deck.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.600
Hey! Where is everybody?

01:43.470 --> 01:48.373
Izzy! Cubby! Skully?

01:48.375 --> 01:50.776
Whoa! What's this?

01:50.778 --> 01:53.812
[all] Surprise!
Happy birthday, Jake!

01:53.814 --> 01:56.715
[laughs] You mates are the best.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.884
You always remember my birthday.

01:58.886 --> 02:03.322
Well, don't just
stand there squawking,
open your present!

02:05.558 --> 02:08.727
Yo-ho, oh boy!
It's a treasure map!

02:08.729 --> 02:13.298
It's more than that, Jake.
It's a Birthday Treasure Map!

02:13.300 --> 02:15.601
It'll show you the way
to a bunch of fun birthday

02:15.603 --> 02:17.402
surprises on Never Land!

02:17.404 --> 02:18.971
Awesome!

02:18.973 --> 02:21.473
This is going to be
the best birthday ever.

02:21.475 --> 02:26.078
[chuckles] A treasure map
to birthday surprises.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.447
Doesn't it sound
delightful, Cap'n?

02:28.449 --> 02:30.482
Birthdays, bah.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.185
Why should a puny pirate
have all the fun?

02:33.187 --> 02:34.786
Oh, I'm sure the sea pups

02:34.788 --> 02:36.522
would be happy to
have us join in

02:36.524 --> 02:38.457
the fun if we asked them.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.326
[scoffs] Captain Hook
would never ask,

02:41.328 --> 02:43.395
but you could.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.430
Ahoy, sea pups.

02:45.432 --> 02:48.534
I heard that it's
your birthday, Jake.

02:48.536 --> 02:52.271
And I just wanted to say
"Happy Birthday." [chuckles]

02:52.273 --> 02:53.805
Thanks!

02:53.807 --> 02:57.809
Say, we're about to go
looking for my birthday
surprises on Never Land!

02:57.811 --> 02:59.278
You want to join us?

02:59.280 --> 03:00.979
I'd love to...

03:00.981 --> 03:04.850
Can I bring the Cap'n...
and Sharky and Bones, too?

03:04.852 --> 03:08.387
Sure! I want everyone
to have fun on my birthday!

03:08.389 --> 03:11.490
Let's all meet at...
Tiki Tree Forest!

03:11.492 --> 03:14.960
Aye-aye!
See you later, sea pups!

03:14.962 --> 03:18.764
Mateys, do you want
to join my birthday
treasure hunt?

03:20.500 --> 03:21.733
Great!

03:21.735 --> 03:23.835
Keep a look out
for gold doubloons.

03:23.837 --> 03:27.239
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

03:27.241 --> 03:30.576
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.644
Is everybody ready?

03:32.646 --> 03:35.480
- I've got my sword.
- I got my map!

03:35.482 --> 03:37.816
And I've got my pixie dust.

03:37.818 --> 03:41.320
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.322
But only in emergencies.

03:43.324 --> 03:47.392
Yo-ho, let's go
celebrate Jake's birthday!

03:50.730 --> 03:53.832
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

Right this way, Mr. Smee.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.251
Well, it's about time.

04:12.253 --> 04:16.188
<i>¶ Oh, it's your</i>
<i>pirate birthday matey! ¶</i>

04:16.190 --> 04:19.591

04:29.370 --> 04:34.039
<i>¶ Yea-hey your</i>
<i>happy birthday day! ¶</i>

04:34.041 --> 04:35.474
Ahoy, Captain Hook!

04:35.476 --> 04:37.876
Ready to have
some birthday fun?

04:37.878 --> 04:41.613
Yes, yes, whatever...
Now let's get on with it, lad.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.115
I'm a busy pirate!

04:43.117 --> 04:45.250
OK, birthday matey.

04:45.252 --> 04:49.621
Lead the way to your
first birthday surprise.

04:49.623 --> 04:53.158
Pin The Tail on
the Tic-Tock Croc!

04:53.160 --> 04:55.427
- Go Jake!
- Straight ahead!

04:55.429 --> 04:57.562
- You're getting hot!
- Oh, dear.

04:57.564 --> 05:00.666
Anchors aweigh! I did it.

05:00.668 --> 05:04.303
Oh, please! Is this
what you puny pirates

05:04.305 --> 05:06.405
call birthday fun?

05:06.407 --> 05:09.241
Pinning a tail on a picture?

05:09.243 --> 05:12.077
You won't know how much
fun it is until you try it!

05:12.079 --> 05:15.580
Oh well, if you insist.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.817
Wrong way, Captain.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.019
Oh, my... Careful sir.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.754
- [Izzy] No!
- [Jake] Look out!

05:22.756 --> 05:24.790
[Cubby] Coconuts!

05:24.792 --> 05:28.527
- [growling]
- [laughing] Victory!

05:28.529 --> 05:31.663
- [growling]
- [laughs]

05:31.665 --> 05:34.766
Just a little birthday fun.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.703
- [growling]
- Smee, save me!

05:37.705 --> 05:40.205
- [Hook shouts] No, no!
- Mr. Tiki Tree!

05:40.207 --> 05:42.040
Could you give
Captain Hook a lift?

05:42.042 --> 05:44.443
Sure thing, lad!

05:44.445 --> 05:46.278
Whoa!

05:49.882 --> 05:51.850
Hook went that-a-way.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.786
[growling]

05:54.788 --> 06:00.659
Way-hey! We saved Captain Hook
and we got three gold doubloons!

06:00.661 --> 06:05.297
Let's grab 'em and go find
my next birthday surprise!

06:05.299 --> 06:08.834
Oh! Well that certainly
was exciting, Cap'n.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.370
Um, are you OK?

06:11.372 --> 06:15.207
Oh fine, but I'm not sure
this is the sort of fun

06:15.209 --> 06:18.710
I would be having if it
were me own birthday party.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.846
Where to next, Jake?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.414
[Jake] Shipwreck Beach!

06:22.416 --> 06:25.350
I wonder what birthday
Surprise we'll find there.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.352
- Yeah!
- Woo-hoo!

06:27.354 --> 06:29.154
[all cheering]

06:29.156 --> 06:31.156
[Jake] Yippee!

06:31.158 --> 06:34.926
[chuckles] Ah, I loves bouncing.

06:34.928 --> 06:38.530
Just like a kangaroo.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.199
It does look like fun,
doesn't it Cap'n?

06:41.201 --> 06:44.202
Men, let's get bouncin'!

06:44.204 --> 06:46.905
[all] Aye-aye, Cap'n!

06:46.907 --> 06:48.774
- [Sharky] Here we go!
- [all shouting]

06:48.776 --> 06:51.176
[all cheering]

06:51.178 --> 06:52.878
[Cubby] A little help, mateys!

06:52.880 --> 06:54.212
I'm stuck!

06:54.214 --> 06:57.015
Hang on!
I'm on my way.

06:59.452 --> 07:02.687
OK Cubby,
let's swing on down.

07:02.689 --> 07:05.690
[both whooping]

07:05.692 --> 07:09.361
Way to go!
We helped Cubby down.

07:09.363 --> 07:12.464
And we got three
more gold doubloons!

07:12.466 --> 07:15.133
Let's grab 'em and go to...

07:15.135 --> 07:17.736
[Jake] Pirate Piñata Plateau!

07:17.738 --> 07:19.638
Be careful, Cap'n!

07:19.640 --> 07:23.875
Don't worry, Mr. Smee.
I'm having fun...

07:23.877 --> 07:25.944
[shouting]

07:25.946 --> 07:28.046
[splashing]

07:31.884 --> 07:35.353
Birthday fun... Bah.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.825
Awesome! A Pirate Piñata!

07:39.827 --> 07:43.895
All you got to do is
break the Piñata open
to get the treats.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.665
Whoa! [laughs]

07:48.267 --> 07:49.734
Ah, barnacles.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.903
Nice try,
birthday matey,

07:51.905 --> 07:53.839
but no treats for you!

07:53.841 --> 07:56.074
OK, now it's Cubby's turn.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.744
Step aside...
Captains first!

07:59.746 --> 08:01.813
Hey, that's not fair!

08:02.148 --> 08:04.816
[grunts]

08:05.184 --> 08:06.585
Blast!

08:06.587 --> 08:09.187
- Uh-oh.
- My pirate piñata!

08:09.189 --> 08:11.490
This is a birthday emergency!

08:11.492 --> 08:13.992
Then it's pixie dust away!

08:17.096 --> 08:18.663
Got it!

08:18.665 --> 08:22.501
Yahoo! We saved
Jake's pirate piñata

08:22.503 --> 08:25.437
and got four more
gold doubloons!

08:25.439 --> 08:28.106
Let's grab 'em and
go back to the party!

08:29.275 --> 08:31.676
It's still my turn!

08:31.678 --> 08:34.713
And I've got the
piñata this time...

08:34.715 --> 08:36.982
I've got it! Yes!

08:36.984 --> 08:40.485
[grunts]

08:40.487 --> 08:43.622
[all cheering]

08:43.624 --> 08:46.825
Are we still
having fun, Cap'n?

08:46.827 --> 08:51.730
Birthday fun, bah!
Oh, dear.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.699
Come on, Captain Hook.
The fun isn't over yet!

08:54.701 --> 08:56.835
According to my
Birthday Treasure Map,

08:56.837 --> 08:59.504
there's one more
birthday surprise.

08:59.506 --> 09:03.909
Bucky! Set sail
for Pirate Island!

09:03.911 --> 09:05.110
[clanging]

09:07.713 --> 09:10.415
[all] Happy birthday, Jake!

09:10.417 --> 09:12.851
- [Jake] Wow!
- [all cheering]

09:12.853 --> 09:16.054
What's the matter, Cap'n?
Aren't you having any fun?

09:16.056 --> 09:20.926
Smee, I've always hated
blasted birthday parties

09:20.928 --> 09:22.894
and I always will!

09:22.896 --> 09:27.566
But why, Cap'n, oh why?

09:27.568 --> 09:33.405
<i>¶ I never had a happy</i>
<i>birthday party of me own ¶</i>

09:33.407 --> 09:37.909
<i>¶ I never had a</i>
<i>birthday party ¶</i>

09:37.911 --> 09:41.046
<i>¶ Where any matey showed </i>

09:41.048 --> 09:44.349
¶ Boo-hoo a blasted birthday

09:44.351 --> 09:46.918
<i>¶ Fie-thumb it's never fun </i>

09:46.920 --> 09:51.089
¶ Boo-hoo a blasted birthday

09:51.091 --> 09:55.860
¶ When you're the only one!

09:55.862 --> 09:57.429
[Izzy] Come on, Jake!

09:57.431 --> 09:59.965
It's time to make
your birthday wish.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.399
[all cheering]

10:01.401 --> 10:04.302
I'd like to thank all
my mateys for being here,

10:04.304 --> 10:08.106
but my wish is to celebrate
two birthdays today.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.776
My birthday...
and Captain Hook's!

10:11.778 --> 10:15.380
- [all] What?!
- What in plunder?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.948
What do you say,
Captain Hook?

10:16.950 --> 10:19.384
Let's blow out our
candle together!

10:19.386 --> 10:22.821
Why... [sniffs]
I'd be honored!

10:22.823 --> 10:24.990
On three...

10:24.992 --> 10:26.157
[both] One...

10:26.159 --> 10:28.460
- Two...
- [chuckles]

10:28.462 --> 10:30.228
What did you expect?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.797
I never follow the rules.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.232
I'm Captain Hook!

10:34.234 --> 10:36.935
[laughs] The one and only.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.104
<i>¶ Yo-ho happy birthday </i>

10:39.106 --> 10:40.839
<i>¶ Yar-harr, hoist away </i>

10:40.841 --> 10:43.975
<i>¶ Yay-hey your</i>

10:43.977 --> 10:46.878
[both] Happy birthday.

10:48.981 --> 10:52.984
Mateys, thanks for
making my birthday
such a special day!

10:52.986 --> 10:54.986
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

10:54.988 --> 10:57.055
into our Team Treasure Chest.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.765
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:06.767 --> 11:08.800
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>

11:08.802 --> 11:10.835
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

11:10.837 --> 11:13.772
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

11:13.774 --> 11:16.107
Come on. Count with us.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.543
[all] Yeah!

11:19.545 --> 11:21.946
[Jake] One, two, three...

11:21.948 --> 11:23.948
[Cubby]
Four, five, six...

11:23.950 --> 11:27.519
[Izzy] Seven, eight, nine, ten.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.789
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today

11:30.791 --> 11:34.059
we got 10 gold doubloons!

11:34.061 --> 11:37.128
And I got the best
birthday party ever!

11:37.130 --> 11:40.532
It was so awesome,
I don't want
the party to end.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.901
Shiver me timbers!

11:42.903 --> 11:46.337
This sounds like a
birthday emergency.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.206
Confetti away!

11:48.208 --> 11:50.975
[giggling]

11:50.977 --> 11:52.310
Confetti!

11:53.546 --> 11:56.981
[Hook groans] I ate
too much coconut cake,

11:56.983 --> 12:00.051
me legs ache from
too much bouncing

12:00.053 --> 12:04.055
and all that music gave
me a poundin' headache!

12:04.057 --> 12:08.193
Oh dear,
you must feel miserable.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.762
On the contrary, Mr. Smee.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.465
I've never been happier.

12:16.535 --> 12:19.170
[Cubby] The Lighthouse Diamond.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.806
[Izzy] Yay-hey, mateys,
look at this!

12:23.542 --> 12:27.746
- It's a note from Red Jessica.
- What's it say, Izz?

12:27.748 --> 12:29.748
"Ahoy, Pirate Friends!

12:29.750 --> 12:33.051
When I was a little girl,
I visited Pirate Island

12:33.053 --> 12:35.920
and saw the
Midnight Sunflowers open

12:35.922 --> 12:40.525
and put on a
dazzling light show and
I haven't seen it since!"

12:40.527 --> 12:42.193
I've never seen it!

12:42.195 --> 12:46.564
"The flowers will
open again tonight
and I must see it!

12:46.566 --> 12:50.101
Join me on the far side
of Pirate Island,

12:50.103 --> 12:52.370
and we can all
watch it together.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.973
Yo-ho, Red Jessica!"

12:54.975 --> 12:56.474
Ah, coconuts!

12:56.476 --> 13:00.478
Tonight's comin' right up,
the sun's goin' down!

13:00.480 --> 13:02.981
I hope Red Jessica
makes it in time!

13:02.983 --> 13:05.250
She'll be there,
and so will we!

13:05.252 --> 13:08.253
Y'know, it's really
dark at midnight,

13:08.255 --> 13:11.422
so we'll need something
to light the way.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.825
Oh, Brightly.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.161
[buzzing]

13:16.163 --> 13:17.295
[chirps]

13:17.297 --> 13:20.665
Mateys, want to come with
us to meet Red Jessica

13:20.667 --> 13:22.600
on the other side
of Pirate Island

13:22.602 --> 13:25.336
and watch the
Midnight Sunflowers open?

13:27.339 --> 13:28.673
Great!

13:28.675 --> 13:31.142
Keep a look out
for gold doubloons.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.579
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.682
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

13:39.251 --> 13:42.287
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

13:42.289 --> 13:44.823
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:44.825 --> 13:46.291
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

13:46.293 --> 13:49.327
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

13:49.329 --> 13:52.130
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

13:52.132 --> 13:55.266
<i>¶ And me </i>

13:57.970 --> 14:01.439
There they are,
the Midnight Sunflowers!

14:01.441 --> 14:04.442
Crackers!
They're closed up
tight as clams!

14:04.444 --> 14:08.179
They're waiting until
night time to open
and put on their show.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.215
Um, it's getting dark now.

14:10.217 --> 14:13.518
How will Red Jessica find us
on this side of the island?

14:13.520 --> 14:17.121
That's how!
That old lighthouse.

14:17.123 --> 14:20.191
But, Jake, that lighthouse
hasn't worked for years.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.193
Maybe we can get it working

14:22.195 --> 14:24.329
and light the way
for Red Jessica!

14:24.331 --> 14:26.030
Let's go check it out!

14:26.032 --> 14:30.034
Here's the door, but it's
all overgrown with weeds!

14:30.036 --> 14:32.837
Stand back, crew.
I'll clear the way!

14:32.839 --> 14:37.242
[Hook] Well, well...
what have we here?

14:37.244 --> 14:40.912
The puny pirates are trying
to enter that old lighthouse.

14:40.914 --> 14:43.348
Whatever could
they want in there?

14:43.350 --> 14:45.250
Oh, you know those
sea pups, Cap'n!

14:45.252 --> 14:48.853
They're probably after
treasure or some-such thing.

14:48.855 --> 14:52.023
Treasure?
Of course.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.558
Smee, to the dinghy!

14:53.560 --> 14:56.394
Oh dear, what have I done?

14:59.031 --> 15:00.832
[Skully] All most there, mateys!

15:02.268 --> 15:05.203
[all] Whoa!
What's that?

15:05.205 --> 15:08.373
[gasps] The Lighthouse Diamond.

15:08.375 --> 15:12.844
Coconuts, it's huge!
It's almost as big as me!

15:12.846 --> 15:15.113
It reflects the
stars and moon

15:15.115 --> 15:17.448
to light the way
for ships sailing by!

15:17.450 --> 15:21.286
Well, it's not reflecting
any light now.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.255
I think it has to spin
around to work right.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.392
Hm... How can
we make it spin?

15:27.394 --> 15:28.726
I have an idea.

15:28.728 --> 15:33.264
Maybe when you turn this crank,
it winds it up, like a clock!

15:33.266 --> 15:36.134
Heave, ho!

15:36.136 --> 15:38.303
[Jake] Heave, ho!

15:38.305 --> 15:40.805
It's working! Huh?

15:40.807 --> 15:44.409
Ho-ho! The diamond is mine!

15:44.411 --> 15:45.944
[both] Captain Hook?

15:45.946 --> 15:47.812
Thank you, popinjays!

15:47.814 --> 15:51.382
I am now the richest pirate
in all of Never Land!

15:51.384 --> 15:56.220
But Captain Hook,
if you take that diamond
then we won't be able to...

15:56.222 --> 15:57.722
[Hook] Run, Smee, run!

15:57.724 --> 15:59.924
We must get this
diamond to the dinghy.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.993
Oh! Oh, dear.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.928
Toodle-oo, sea pups.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.797
If Hook's got the diamond,

16:05.799 --> 16:09.300
we won't be able
to signal Red Jessica
with the lighthouse!

16:09.302 --> 16:12.337
And she might sail
past Pirate Island.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.906
We've got to get
the diamond back!

16:14.908 --> 16:18.943
Yo-ho, down we go!

16:18.945 --> 16:23.247
[all whooping]

16:23.249 --> 16:24.582
[grunts]

16:24.584 --> 16:27.285
My diamond!

16:27.287 --> 16:30.421
Fie and folderol!
Get it, Smee!

16:30.423 --> 16:34.559
It's not yours, Captain Hook,
it belongs in the lighthouse!

16:37.363 --> 16:40.565
[Izzy] Leaf-surfing pirates, ho!

16:42.668 --> 16:45.336
[grunts] Got it!

16:45.338 --> 16:47.438
Yo-ho, way to go, Izzy.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.809
We got the diamond back,
and we got two gold doubloons!

16:51.811 --> 16:55.179
Let's grab 'em and
go back to the lighthouse.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.148
Huh?

16:57.150 --> 17:01.352
We've snagged a "big fish."
And by fish, I mean diamond!

17:01.354 --> 17:02.653
[laughs]

17:02.655 --> 17:05.456
Captain Hook,
you don't understand!

17:05.458 --> 17:07.158
We need that diamond to...

17:07.160 --> 17:08.960
I understand this,

17:08.962 --> 17:11.662
I've got meself a huge diamond!

17:11.664 --> 17:14.232
[gasping] Oh, Cap'n, sir,

17:14.234 --> 17:17.535
do the popinjays seem
more intent than usual

17:17.537 --> 17:19.370
on getting back
their treasure?

17:19.372 --> 17:23.374
All pirates want
diamonds and gold!

17:23.376 --> 17:26.044
- And... a pit?!
- Uh, beg your...

17:26.046 --> 17:27.912
[shouting]

17:27.914 --> 17:30.314
Oh, Cap'n, look!

17:30.316 --> 17:34.052
A whole pit filled with
beautiful crystals!

17:34.054 --> 17:37.021
But only one
priceless diamond!

17:37.023 --> 17:40.525
How am I to know
which gem is mine?

17:40.527 --> 17:42.493
Slithering sea snakes!

17:42.495 --> 17:44.862
Hook dropped the
diamond in there?

17:44.864 --> 17:47.365
It could take us
hours to find it.

17:47.367 --> 17:51.069
By then it will be too late
to signal Red Jessica!

17:51.071 --> 17:55.440
Wait a minute.
The Lighthouse Diamond
is special, right?

17:55.442 --> 17:58.776
Yep, it's the only diamond
that can reflect enough light

17:58.778 --> 18:00.445
to be seen by ships at sea.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.347
Then I know just
how to find it!

18:03.349 --> 18:07.285
Brightly! Light up
Gemstone Pit, quick!

18:07.287 --> 18:09.153
[chirps]

18:10.856 --> 18:12.356
[Cubby] That's not it.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.058
Not that one!

18:14.060 --> 18:16.561
The Lighthouse Diamond!

18:16.563 --> 18:19.397
Thanks to Brightly,
we found it!

18:19.399 --> 18:21.732
And we got two more
gold doubloons.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.469
Let's grab 'em and
go get the diamond!

18:25.237 --> 18:27.738
Yay-hey, I'm on my way!

18:27.740 --> 18:31.242
My diamond!
I found it!

18:31.244 --> 18:33.945
[both] And... got it!

18:33.947 --> 18:37.148
Let go of my
diamond, Jake!

18:37.150 --> 18:39.951
Captain Hook,
you can't have
this diamond,

18:39.953 --> 18:41.419
it's too important to...

18:41.421 --> 18:46.424
What's important is
that I be the richest
pirate in Never Land!

18:46.426 --> 18:50.561
But the diamond shows
ships where to sail and
tonight it's helping...

18:50.563 --> 18:53.397
[gasps] Red Jessica!

18:53.399 --> 18:56.467
That's what I've
been trying to say!

18:56.469 --> 18:59.504
She's coming to see
the Midnight Sunflowers!

18:59.506 --> 19:02.573
But she'll sail
right past our
island in the dark

19:02.575 --> 19:05.576
if we don't get
the diamond back
to the lighthouse!

19:05.578 --> 19:10.047
We must return
this diamond to the
lighthouse, immediately!

19:13.118 --> 19:17.588
[pants] I'm exhausted.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.957
Someone else is
going to have to...

19:19.959 --> 19:22.293
carry it the
rest of the way.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.828
Hurry, ye swabs, hurry!

19:23.830 --> 19:27.498
Red Jessica will sail
right past the island!

19:27.500 --> 19:31.636
No time!
This is an emergency!

19:31.638 --> 19:33.538
Up we go, mateys!

19:39.278 --> 19:42.113
Almost there! Heave...

19:42.115 --> 19:43.781
[all] Ho!

19:52.891 --> 19:56.661
[Cubby] It's working!
She saw the light
from the diamond!

19:56.663 --> 20:00.064
Red Jessica's
turning toward us!

20:00.066 --> 20:03.668
We did it!
With Captain Hook
and Mr. Smee's help,

20:03.670 --> 20:07.004
we got the Pirate Island
Lighthouse working in time!

20:07.006 --> 20:10.041
And we got three more
gold doubloons!

20:10.043 --> 20:14.378
Let's grab 'em and go greet
Red Jessica at the shore.

20:15.347 --> 20:18.382
Ahoy there, Red Jessica!

20:18.384 --> 20:20.418
Ahoy James!

20:20.420 --> 20:22.587
Thanks for lighting the way!

20:22.589 --> 20:27.358
You've arrived just in time to
watch the Midnight Sunflowers!

20:27.360 --> 20:31.195
I had no idea you were
so interested in flowers!

20:31.197 --> 20:33.064
Oh indeed!

20:33.066 --> 20:38.569
Especially the prettiest flower
in all of Never Land... you!

20:38.571 --> 20:42.173
- Oh, James.
- Oh, brother.

20:44.509 --> 20:46.911
All hands, look alive.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.914
Psst. Brightly, lights out.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.749
[chirping]

20:51.751 --> 20:55.753
It should begin any second.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.757
[all gasping]

20:59.759 --> 21:01.292
[Izzy] Wow...

21:01.294 --> 21:02.526
[Cubby] Whoa...

21:02.528 --> 21:05.029
[Red Jessica] It's beautiful.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.832
Beautiful, indeed.

21:09.468 --> 21:13.204
[chuckles] Looks like the
Cap'n finally got something

21:13.206 --> 21:14.639
he can treasure forever.

21:14.641 --> 21:18.309
A smile from his favorite gal.

21:20.646 --> 21:24.949
Thanks for helping
return the diamond to
the lighthouse, mateys!

21:24.951 --> 21:29.287
And for helping
Red Jessica see the
Midnight Sunflowers again!

21:29.289 --> 21:33.691
Now let's put all our
gold doubloons into our
Team Treasure Chest.

21:40.932 --> 21:43.267
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:43.269 --> 21:45.303
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:45.305 --> 21:47.338
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

21:47.340 --> 21:50.341
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

21:50.343 --> 21:52.677
Come on. Count with us.

21:53.679 --> 21:55.346
[all] Yeah!

21:56.648 --> 21:58.582
[Izzy] One, two...

21:58.584 --> 21:59.850
[Cubby] Three, four...

21:59.852 --> 22:02.853
[Jake] Five, six, seven!

22:02.855 --> 22:06.624
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:06.626 --> 22:08.826
we got seven gold doubloons.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.496
Now let's go back
to our hideout and...

22:12.498 --> 22:15.833
[buzzing]

22:15.835 --> 22:17.935
Ah, coconuts.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.104
Brightly's plum tuckered out!

22:20.106 --> 22:22.773
How can we see where
we're going in the dark?

22:22.775 --> 22:27.345
No problem, mateys.
This Midnight Sunflower
will light our way!

22:27.347 --> 22:30.781
[both] Yo-ho, Izzy!
Way to go!

22:33.618 --> 22:37.988
[Smee] Well, Cap'n,
that was quite a wonderful
night for all of us.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.724
Indeed, Smee!

22:39.726 --> 22:43.794
That is why
I picked a single
Midnight Sunflower...

22:43.796 --> 22:48.733
to remember this
most romantic of evenings!

22:48.735 --> 22:53.738
[sighs] Have you ever seen
anything so lovely, Smee?

22:53.740 --> 22:56.006
[sniffs]

22:56.008 --> 22:58.175
Unhand me nose!

22:58.177 --> 23:01.712
Fie on you,
furious flower!

23:01.714 --> 23:06.684
Well, that's my Cap'n...
a real flower fan. [chuckles]

23:06.686 --> 23:10.254
Who wants to play delay?

23:11.723 --> 23:14.658
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

23:14.660 --> 23:17.194
<i>¶ Delay </i>

23:17.196 --> 23:19.096
<i>¶ There's a pirate game</i>
<i>that we like to play ¶</i>
