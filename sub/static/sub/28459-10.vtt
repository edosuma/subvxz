26:06.567 --> 26:08.066
- Glass of water, Madame.
- Thank you so much.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.266
- You're welcome.
- Did you see Sophia

26:09.300 --> 26:11.667
is living in D.C. now
and going to school?

26:11.700 --> 26:13.333
- Does she like it?
- She does.

26:13.367 --> 26:14.734
You know,
she was nervous to go,

26:14.767 --> 26:16.767
because she didn't want
to leave home,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.367
and it was really, like,
an emotional situation.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.667
Are you applying
to colleges now?

26:20.700 --> 26:22.734
- I'm applying
to New School, yeah.

26:22.767 --> 26:26.033
- I remember when your girls
were so shy.

26:26.066 --> 26:28.166
It's nice to see them
come into their own.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.333
- It's so nice to see.
You should see.

26:30.367 --> 26:33.133
- They're really beautiful
young adults.

26:33.166 --> 26:34.600
Really. You know,
you have these good girls.

26:34.633 --> 26:36.133
- Thank you.

26:36.166 --> 26:38.567
- It is so surreal for me
to look at Lisa's girls

26:38.600 --> 26:41.600
and think Sam and Lola are
gonna be that age very soon.

26:41.633 --> 26:43.266
- Wait, Mom?
- Yeah?

26:43.300 --> 26:45.333
- Do you have any more heels?
I can't really walk in these.

26:45.367 --> 26:48.367
- They're Christian Louboutin.
You got to figure it out.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.133
Oh, I wish I could
bottle up my girls

26:51.166 --> 26:52.767
and keep 'em young forever.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.100
- I'm gonna go home.
- Oh, are you?

26:55.133 --> 26:58.033
- It's three of my friends'
birthdays.

26:58.066 --> 26:59.300
- Have fun.

26:59.333 --> 27:02.233
- Bye, Lylee.
Thanks for stopping by.

27:02.266 --> 27:04.200
- Bye, guys. Nice seeing you.

27:04.233 --> 27:05.367
- Amelia, are you leaving,
honey?

27:05.400 --> 27:07.433
- Yeah. I have school.

27:07.467 --> 27:08.767
- Bye. Love you.
- Bye.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.033
- Bye, Nana.
- Thank you for coming.

27:11.066 --> 27:12.133
- Ready to order?

27:12.166 --> 27:14.300
- Can I have
the chicken paillard?

27:14.333 --> 27:16.300
- Can I get pizza?
- Yes.

27:16.333 --> 27:19.233
- I'll actually grab a drink.
- Yeah, wine or beer?

27:19.266 --> 27:22.633
- They only have wine or beer.
- Oh, no tequila?

27:22.667 --> 27:26.266
Oh. All right,
I'll pass.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.200
- Did you
enjoy yesterday?

27:28.233 --> 27:31.066
- Oh, I had
an amazing time.

27:31.100 --> 27:34.233
- Did you ever hear
back from Lisa?

27:34.266 --> 27:37.367
- Well, I texted her
that she was missed,

27:37.400 --> 27:41.734
and then she said
that she wasn't invited.

27:41.767 --> 27:44.300
- Stop.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.200
I'm sorry, what?

27:49.233 --> 27:54.100
Unbelievable.
That is such a joke.

27:54.133 --> 27:57.734
I literally didn't leave
a stone unturned, Camille.

27:57.767 --> 28:02.700
Yeah, like I didn't invite
Lisa Vanderpump. Please.

28:02.734 --> 28:04.166
Look at this:

28:04.200 --> 28:07.667
Delivered. Delivered.
Birthday message. Delivered.

28:07.700 --> 28:12.100
This is such bullsh--.
I cannot deal with a liar.

28:12.133 --> 28:14.066
So what did you say
when she said that?

28:14.100 --> 28:17.066
- Oh, I just said,
"Oh, that's"--

28:17.100 --> 28:19.100
basically, I didn't know.

28:19.133 --> 28:20.767
I said, "I didn't know
you weren't invited.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.133
"Nobody told me that.

28:22.166 --> 28:24.200
"Of course, I would
have wanted you there.

28:24.233 --> 28:27.066
Sorry. It was lovely."

28:27.100 --> 28:28.500
- Lisa says,
"Oh, I wasn't invited,"

28:28.533 --> 28:30.700
and Camille just says,
"Oh, I didn't know that."

28:30.734 --> 28:34.000
Really, Camille? I mean, I know
it's not fun to be honest

28:34.033 --> 28:38.500
with Lisa Vanderpump sometimes,
but what on Earth is that?

28:38.533 --> 28:40.233
- Lois, what do you think
of all this?

28:40.266 --> 28:43.433
- I think it's bullsh--.

28:43.467 --> 28:46.734
- Ah, Lois!
- Whoo!

28:46.767 --> 28:50.166
- This is the wisest woman
in this room.

28:52.700 --> 28:54.033
- Madame.
- Thank you so much.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.367
- You're welcome.
- Wow, is that all salt?

28:56.400 --> 29:00.300
- It is all salt.
- Wow, that's gorgeous.

29:00.333 --> 29:04.333
Guys, look at this fish
encrusted in salt.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.700
- Wow.

29:05.734 --> 29:07.700
- Harry Hamlin
would love this fish.

29:07.734 --> 29:11.200
- Where is Harry?
- You know what? I invited him.

29:11.233 --> 29:12.700
- He's busy?

29:12.734 --> 29:15.333
- Well, it's a pretty big day
politically

29:15.367 --> 29:18.400
because of the Brett Kavanaugh
hearing.

29:18.433 --> 29:20.367
- The Senate hearings.
- Oh, my God.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.734
- It's heartbreaking.

29:22.767 --> 29:25.734
- The fact that this doctor
came out.

29:25.767 --> 29:31.166
I think she's changing
everything with her courage.

29:32.433 --> 29:35.500
- I just have a different
point of view on this one.

29:35.533 --> 29:37.200
- What were you saying,
Camille?

29:37.233 --> 29:38.533
- I just have a totally
different feeling.

29:38.567 --> 29:40.734
- Why do you have
a totally different feeling?

29:40.767 --> 29:45.433
- She didn't have
enough evidence.

29:45.467 --> 29:49.367
When you are gonna go up
against the Senate

29:49.400 --> 29:51.166
in something like that,

29:51.200 --> 29:53.767
you better have
your witnesses lined up

29:54.000 --> 29:55.033
because that's
a very tough thing--

29:55.066 --> 29:57.133
- But isn't that sickening
to say?

29:57.166 --> 29:58.567
- Yeah it is. Yeah.

29:58.600 --> 30:02.033
- If you were, at 15, you would
tell your best friend,

30:02.066 --> 30:03.433
or you would tell your parents.
- No.

30:03.467 --> 30:06.433
- Camille, not necessarily.
Absolutely not.

30:06.467 --> 30:07.533
- I do not agree.

30:07.567 --> 30:11.033
[tense music]

30:11.600 --> 30:13.333
- Coming up...

30:13.367 --> 30:15.433
- Hold on, you're not
gonna believe this.

30:15.467 --> 30:18.166
Lisa Rinna, guess who's here
right now watching us?

30:18.200 --> 30:19.333
- Who?
- My sister Kim.

30:19.367 --> 30:21.233
- What?

30:26.700 --> 30:27.300
- If you were, at 15,

30:28.333 --> 30:30.066
you would tell
your best friend,

30:30.100 --> 30:31.533
or you would tell
your parents.

30:31.567 --> 30:34.467
- Camille, not necessarily.
Absolutely not.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.300
- I do not agree.

30:39.166 --> 30:42.633
- I was attacked when I was
in seventh grade,

30:42.667 --> 30:45.367
and I have never spoken
about it until recently

30:45.400 --> 30:50.433
because of the Me Too movement,
so I believe her.

30:50.467 --> 30:53.333
- I'm a victim too.

30:53.367 --> 30:54.633
- Did you come out
and tell people?

30:54.667 --> 30:57.333
- I told my boyfriend.
I told my mother.

30:57.367 --> 30:59.000
I told my therapist.
I told people.

30:59.033 --> 31:00.333
- Well, so did this woman.

31:00.367 --> 31:02.000
- I didn't hold on
to it for 35 years.

31:02.033 --> 31:04.000
- This woman did.
- She did the same thing.

31:04.033 --> 31:05.500
She told her husband.
She told her therapist.

31:05.533 --> 31:08.100
- But she told
her husband years after.

31:08.133 --> 31:11.500
It doesn't make sense.

31:11.533 --> 31:13.200
- Do you not
believe her, though?

31:13.233 --> 31:15.100
Do you not believe this woman?

31:15.133 --> 31:17.367
- We don't know if, for sure,
it happened or not.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.066
- Camille.

31:19.100 --> 31:20.333
- He said she said.
- Camille, do you want--

31:20.367 --> 31:21.500
- It just pisses me off.
- Camille--

31:21.533 --> 31:24.166
- You don't think women
should be heard?

31:24.200 --> 31:26.367
- I think women
should be heard.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.400
- Do you not believe her
for getting up

31:28.433 --> 31:31.266
in front of the ----ing world
and telling this story?

31:31.300 --> 31:32.533
- And not getting anything
out of it.

31:32.567 --> 31:34.300
If anything,

31:34.333 --> 31:36.100
it's the worst thing
that ever happened to her.

31:36.133 --> 31:38.600
- Do you not believe her?
Camille, she's a doctor.

31:38.633 --> 31:42.367
- Do you believe
that all doctors are right?

31:42.400 --> 31:44.166
Do you believe that,

31:44.200 --> 31:46.166
because somebody holds a PhD,
that they're correct?

31:46.200 --> 31:47.467
- I don't, but she's not--

31:47.500 --> 31:49.533
- Not necessarily,
but she's been attacked.

31:49.567 --> 31:50.767
- Yes, she has been.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.433
- But, Camille, how would you
feel right now,

31:52.467 --> 31:54.567
if I said to you,
"I don't believe you"?

31:54.600 --> 31:57.200
- That's your prerogative.

31:57.233 --> 32:00.567
This woman has some serious
allegations, and I feel bad

32:00.600 --> 32:02.567
for what him and his family
are going through.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.200
- But the fact that you

32:04.233 --> 32:06.367
actually have had
this experience,

32:06.400 --> 32:08.100
I would think you would be
more empathetic to this woman.

32:08.133 --> 32:11.233
- I am very empathetic to women
that have had this,

32:11.266 --> 32:16.100
but I've also been accused
of things that I've never done.

32:17.633 --> 32:20.567
When I went through my divorce,
I was taken down.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.700
I was maligned.
I was emotionally beaten down.

32:23.734 --> 32:27.266
- Camille, people have very
aggressive opinions about you.

32:27.300 --> 32:31.433
"Conniving. Passive-aggressive.
Narcissistic. Catty.

32:31.467 --> 32:35.066
"Jealous. Cruel.
Hypocritical. Self-absorbed.

32:35.100 --> 32:40.200
Manipulative. Fake.
Insincere. Delusional."

32:40.233 --> 32:41.700
- It's horrible to go
through that

32:41.734 --> 32:44.533
when you've done a lot
of good things in your life.

32:44.567 --> 32:47.200
- I think I've helped everybody
out here in this hot tub.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.567
I have this Jesus complex,
I think.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.600
- I empathize with what Brett
Kavanaugh is going through.

32:52.633 --> 32:54.367
I've been in that position.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.300
No, I'm really
impassioned about this,

32:56.333 --> 32:59.467
and I know what it feels like
to be wrongfully accused

32:59.500 --> 33:03.600
and humiliated all over
the--not the country,

33:03.633 --> 33:06.367
the world, for lies.

33:08.200 --> 33:12.734
- Camille comparing herself
to Brett Kavanaugh

33:12.767 --> 33:15.367
is ----ing weird.
I'm sorry.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.633
I mean, I know she has
a ----ed-up sense of herself.

33:18.667 --> 33:20.367
But it isn't about you,
Camille.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.633
This is about
a much bigger thing.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.633
He's gonna be a judge
on our court

33:24.667 --> 33:27.133
for the rest
of his ----ing life,

33:27.166 --> 33:30.333
and that is
a very big ----ing thing.

33:30.367 --> 33:32.233
- I'm just gonna say
that my mom said

33:32.266 --> 33:35.633
never talk about religion,
politics, or sex

33:35.667 --> 33:37.367
in public settings.
I think we should...

33:37.400 --> 33:38.533
- I know. I agree.
- Change.

33:38.567 --> 33:40.667
Let's just change it up here.

33:40.700 --> 33:44.367
- Can I just say this?
It doesn't sound to me

33:44.400 --> 33:46.266
like this
is a discussion about politics.

33:46.300 --> 33:47.633
- We're trying to get
out of that.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.233
We're trying to get out of
that into something else.

33:49.266 --> 33:50.767
- No, I understand that,
but I also wanted

33:51.000 --> 33:53.367
to make a point
that it's not about politics.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.467
- Lois, I'm sorry.
- Oh, sorry, Lois.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.500
- I think we need
to cheers Lois.

33:58.533 --> 34:00.600
- Let's. Okay.
[tapping on glass]

34:00.633 --> 34:02.667
I just want to thank you all
for coming tonight

34:02.700 --> 34:04.633
because this is really
for my mom.

34:04.667 --> 34:07.400
This is about Lois.
To Lois.

34:07.433 --> 34:10.333
- Whoo!
- Lois!

34:10.367 --> 34:11.667
- I forgot.

34:11.699 --> 34:15.300
I have to go to the restroom.

34:15.333 --> 34:16.667
Hold on,
you're not gonna believe this.

34:16.699 --> 34:19.400
Lisa Rinna, guess who's here
right now watching us?

34:19.433 --> 34:20.632
- Who?
- My sister Kim.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.433
- What?
- She just sent me

34:22.467 --> 34:25.233
a text saying,
"I'm watching you."

34:25.266 --> 34:26.567
- Hi, Kim. How are ya?
There she is.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.300
Hi, Kim. How are ya?

34:28.333 --> 34:29.333
- You're lying to me.
- I just waved to her.

34:29.367 --> 34:31.199
There she is.

34:31.233 --> 34:33.266
Hi, Kim. She's in the corner.
I just waved to her.

34:33.300 --> 34:36.300
- Oh. My. God.
- Hi, Kim.

34:36.333 --> 34:37.467
She's right there
in the corner.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.734
Hi, Kim. How are ya?

34:38.766 --> 34:40.400
- Is the last time you saw her
with the bunny?

34:40.433 --> 34:42.600
- Yes.

34:42.632 --> 34:46.699
- I brought the bunny,
so I think what I should do

34:46.734 --> 34:48.533
is give it to you.

34:48.567 --> 34:53.400
I don't feel it was given to me
with the right energy.

34:53.433 --> 34:56.467
- Life is interesting.
- Okay, I'm gonna leave ahead.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.600
Bye, guys.
Keep it safe, Lois.

34:58.633 --> 35:00.367
Keep everything
under wraps, please.

35:00.400 --> 35:04.233
- You too.

35:04.266 --> 35:08.567
- Oh, my God, the irony.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.767
- What are the odds?

35:10.000 --> 35:13.767
- Oh, my God,
you look so gorgeous.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.567
You look beautiful.
- So do you.

35:17.600 --> 35:22.200
- Lisa, how do you feel
about seeing Kim?

35:22.233 --> 35:25.467
- I'm fine with it.
I really am.

35:25.500 --> 35:29.000
She's a human existing,
just like I am, right?

35:29.033 --> 35:31.600
- Yeah.
[laughter]

35:31.633 --> 35:35.467
Wait, did Camille leave?

35:35.500 --> 35:38.667
- Like, they're both scarred.
They are both scarred for life.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.500
- No. It's okay. No.

35:40.533 --> 35:42.633
I just feel so bad about
the political conversation

35:42.667 --> 35:45.000
because I just
feel bad for people.

35:45.033 --> 35:48.300
I don't like when people
do that kind of stuff.

35:48.333 --> 35:50.066
I don't know why I get
so upset about that.

35:50.100 --> 35:51.734
Like, I've been the victim.

35:51.767 --> 35:55.233
I've been accused of things
that I've never done,

35:55.266 --> 35:57.300
and it feels horrible
to be put in that position.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.500
- You're allowed to have
a difference of opinion

35:58.533 --> 36:00.333
and still go up there

36:00.367 --> 36:01.667
and still have fun
and laugh 'cause that's...

36:01.700 --> 36:03.467
- Okay. You're right.
- What friends do.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.734
That's what friends do.

36:05.000 --> 36:05.767
Okay, I'm going
to have fun.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.266
- Oh, I wanted
to talk to you.

36:07.300 --> 36:08.633
Thank you for
being there for me,

36:08.667 --> 36:11.667
and I wanted to ask you
to be one of my bridesmaids.

36:11.700 --> 36:14.633
- Oh! You had me going.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.567
I would love to do it.
- Thank you.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.767
- I would love to be
a bridesmaid.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.333
I mean, I never thought
you'd ask me at the bottom

36:21.367 --> 36:23.433
of the stairs crying
after a big fight upstairs,

36:23.467 --> 36:26.000
but, yeah, I'll be
a bridesmaid.

36:26.033 --> 36:27.166
Absolutely, yes.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.433
- Yes, yes.
- Now go up there, have fun...

36:28.467 --> 36:29.734
- Okay.
Sorry that I got emotional.

36:29.767 --> 36:31.767
- And don't make excuses
for your opinion.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.734
- Okay.

36:35.533 --> 36:36.700
- Are you okay?

36:36.734 --> 36:38.633
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not. What's wrong?

36:38.667 --> 36:40.433
- I don't want to talk
about it.

36:40.467 --> 36:44.734
- Did I hurt your feelings?

36:44.767 --> 36:46.333
What triggered you today?

36:46.367 --> 36:52.767
- I've been a victim of
a smear campaign, and it hurts.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.533
You know, yeah,
it didn't make him look good.

36:56.567 --> 36:58.700
[sobs]

36:58.734 --> 37:00.533
- He doesn't have
that power anymore.

37:00.567 --> 37:03.467
- He doesn't have that power,
and you are moving on

37:03.500 --> 37:08.533
to a brand-new life
and you deserve it.

37:08.567 --> 37:11.567
- I'm gonna head out.
- I'm gonna walk out with you.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.500
- Nice meeting you.
- It was nice to meet you too.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.533
- Lois, I enjoyed
dinner tonight.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.700
- Oh, it was fun
seeing you again.

37:18.734 --> 37:22.667
- Oh, bye.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.000
I'll take it.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.633
- This has been a heavy dinner,
you guys.

37:25.667 --> 37:27.000
Wow.

37:27.033 --> 37:28.533
- Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

37:28.567 --> 37:30.700
- I swear to God.
- Are you kidding me?

37:30.734 --> 37:32.133
Is this a coincidence?
- Yeah.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.667
- Is this a coincidence?
- Yes.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.133
I wasn't even going
to go out tonight.

37:35.166 --> 37:37.133
- Can this night get
any more strange?

37:37.166 --> 37:39.433
- It's so nice
that everybody came.

37:39.467 --> 37:41.100
- Everyone's here.

37:41.133 --> 37:42.166
I mean there are, like, what,

37:42.200 --> 37:44.667
12 million people
in Los Angeles,

37:44.700 --> 37:47.033
maybe 10,000 restaurants?

37:47.066 --> 37:48.333
I love you. Bye.
- You're going?

37:48.367 --> 37:49.533
- Yes, bye, thank you.

37:49.567 --> 37:50.734
Both of my sisters are here.
How funny is that?

37:50.767 --> 37:52.100
- I know. Unbelievable.

37:52.133 --> 37:53.767
- I mean I am really happy

37:54.000 --> 37:55.333
we're on speaking terms
right now.

37:57.066 --> 38:00.333
- Oh, Kim Richards
is downstairs visiting.

38:06.767 --> 38:08.133
- Congratulations, Camille.

38:08.166 --> 38:10.033
- Thank you. Oh, my God.

38:10.066 --> 38:13.133
- Go back to the last time
I saw Kim Richards.

38:15.100 --> 38:16.533
I'm gonna walk away
for just a second

38:16.567 --> 38:18.734
'cause this just
doesn't feel quite right.

38:18.767 --> 38:21.033
Why would I give
two ----ing sh--s

38:21.066 --> 38:22.533
to walk over and say hi to her?

38:22.567 --> 38:24.734
- Lisa, thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

38:24.767 --> 38:26.600
Honey, out of sight,
out of mind.

38:26.633 --> 38:30.400
Like, I'm not thinking
of Kim Richards, okay? No.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.033
Thank you for having us.

38:32.066 --> 38:34.500
- Thank you. It was amazing.
- You're so sweet. Thank you.

38:34.533 --> 38:36.000
Thank you so much.

38:36.033 --> 38:39.166
I just walked right by.
- Just walked by?

38:39.200 --> 38:40.600
- [laughs]

38:48.633 --> 38:50.433
♪ ♪

38:50.467 --> 38:53.100
- So my yoga class was really
nice this morning.

38:53.133 --> 38:54.533
- Oh, good.

38:54.567 --> 38:57.700
- Look how gorgeous you look.
You are stunning.

38:57.734 --> 38:59.700
Where's your mom?
- I don't know.

38:59.734 --> 39:03.467
She's in and out so much,
I never know where she's going.

39:03.500 --> 39:06.033
- I'm exhausted
by all these dogs.

39:06.066 --> 39:08.066
Like, we went
from one to three.

39:08.100 --> 39:10.233
- I don't know
how you manage it.

39:10.266 --> 39:11.734
- I don't either.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.567
What did you think
of that dinner last night?

39:13.600 --> 39:17.166
- Oh, my gosh. It was wild.
It really was.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.000
I don't think I've ever
heard you women

39:19.033 --> 39:21.200
speaking about politics
or anything like that.

39:21.233 --> 39:24.133
- Well, we don't usually,
but because of what's going on,

39:24.166 --> 39:25.567
it's very, very timely,

39:25.600 --> 39:27.600
and, you know,
women coming out,

39:27.633 --> 39:31.266
being honest about being raped
and sexually harassed.

39:31.300 --> 39:34.166
I mean they've kept quiet
for a long time,

39:34.200 --> 39:36.467
and there's a reason
why they keep quiet.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.133
- I know.
- You know?

39:39.166 --> 39:40.667
- Yeah.

39:40.700 --> 39:42.700
- But you were lucky.
- I was very lucky, very.

39:42.734 --> 39:44.567
- You were lucky.
- Yeah.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.567
I should not even be here.
You shouldn't even be here.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.600
- I know.

39:47.633 --> 39:49.166
A few years
before I was born,

39:49.200 --> 39:52.700
my mom was attacked
by a man that she worked with.

39:52.734 --> 39:55.166
- That was a really bad thing,

39:55.200 --> 39:56.767
and I knew him.
- Yeah.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.133
He picked her up
at the bus stop,

39:58.166 --> 39:59.734
and then, all of a sudden,

39:59.767 --> 40:02.266
he started to drive her down
this really deserted road.

40:02.300 --> 40:05.567
- I thought that was it,
that I was going bye-bye.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.700
He's straddling me, and he had
a hammer in one hand,

40:08.734 --> 40:10.567
a knife in another.

40:10.600 --> 40:14.533
- He tried to rape her.
He tried to kill her.

40:14.567 --> 40:16.600
Luckily, a military policeman

40:16.633 --> 40:19.066
had seen them drive
down this deserted road

40:19.100 --> 40:20.633
and he knew no one was
supposed to be down there,

40:20.667 --> 40:23.066
so he followed them down.
My mom was saved that day,

40:23.100 --> 40:25.066
because of the
military policeman.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.500
- I was the first one
that he went to jail for.

40:27.533 --> 40:29.100
They gave him
7 1/2 years.

40:29.133 --> 40:30.233
- That's right,
and then he got out.

40:30.266 --> 40:31.700
- Yeah.

40:31.734 --> 40:33.000
- Had he killed anybody yet,
to that point?

40:33.033 --> 40:34.533
- Not at that point.

40:34.567 --> 40:36.300
- After he got out,
he then did all the murders.

40:36.333 --> 40:39.133
- Yeah, and then he went
back for life.

40:39.166 --> 40:44.000
- He became a serial killer.
He killed many people.

40:44.033 --> 40:46.767
- 16 to 18 women.
- Oh.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.600
You know, when you first
hear about it, you're like,

40:49.633 --> 40:52.600
"That can't be real.
Like, how is that real?"

40:52.633 --> 40:54.233
It's real.

40:54.266 --> 40:56.266
I still can't remember
when you actually told me,

40:56.300 --> 40:58.600
'cause I remember when I was
growing up, you would say

40:58.633 --> 41:00.533
that you couldn't
smell anything

41:00.567 --> 41:02.133
and you had metal plates
in your head

41:02.166 --> 41:04.533
because some kid
on the playground hit you

41:04.567 --> 41:06.066
on the head with a hammer.

41:06.100 --> 41:09.100
- Is that what I said?
- I was--just thought

41:09.133 --> 41:11.000
that was what happened.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.767
When I finally
learned the truth,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.667
I had such great sadness
and empathy for my mom

41:15.700 --> 41:18.266
knowing that, not only did
this happen to her

41:18.300 --> 41:20.166
but that she basically

41:20.200 --> 41:24.233
just stuffed those feelings
for how many years.

41:24.266 --> 41:26.233
She never dealt with it.
She never even talked about it.

41:26.266 --> 41:28.200
She never even told
her daughter about it.

41:28.233 --> 41:31.667
- I told myself
I wasn't gonna have you

41:31.700 --> 41:33.633
a little scared girl
running around,

41:33.667 --> 41:34.767
but it was hard
for me to let go.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.266
- Well, I was never scared,

41:36.300 --> 41:38.700
but I think you were
so overprotective

41:38.734 --> 41:42.100
that I never trusted anything.

41:42.133 --> 41:44.266
I must have put out
such an energy

41:44.300 --> 41:46.734
that no one would ever
even (BLEEP) with me.

41:46.767 --> 41:48.734
- Hmm.

41:48.767 --> 41:51.133
- It's really rare that I'm one
of the only people that I know

41:51.166 --> 41:54.400
that was not raped
or sexually harassed

41:54.433 --> 41:56.100
any way, shape, or form
in my life.

41:56.133 --> 41:59.700
Because my mom didn't tell me
for so many years,

41:59.734 --> 42:02.300
seeing Dr. Ford get run
through the wringer

42:02.333 --> 42:04.667
touches me in a very deep way.

42:04.700 --> 42:07.400
It takes so much courage
to come forward.

42:07.433 --> 42:08.633
I think the least we can do

42:08.667 --> 42:11.734
is show these victims
compassion.

42:11.767 --> 42:13.600
You're a true survivor.

42:13.633 --> 42:17.066
- Yeah. I am I guess, you know.
- You are. You're strong.

42:17.100 --> 42:19.300
- That's probably why I have
lived this long.

42:19.333 --> 42:21.300
- Maybe.

42:21.333 --> 42:23.700
- And you'll probably be 100.
- Oh, God.

42:23.734 --> 42:26.700
- 105 or more, they say.
[laughs]

42:26.734 --> 42:31.734
No. Don't worry about it.
- 105. Oh, my God.

42:31.767 --> 42:33.233
- Later this season

42:33.266 --> 42:35.166

Housewives of Beverly Hills":

42:35.200 --> 42:38.300

- Yeah!

42:42.066 --> 42:43.166

42:43.200 --> 42:44.400
- Bitch, you're
dressed like me!

42:44.433 --> 42:46.033
- Pop the plug.

42:46.066 --> 42:47.400
- I used to wear
these contraptions.

42:47.433 --> 42:48.767
- What?

42:49.000 --> 42:52.066
- You mean a strap-on?
- Oh, my God!

42:52.100 --> 42:55.300
- Rosé all day.
- I'm so confused.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.400
Can we start
from the beginning?

42:57.433 --> 42:59.300
- Cheers.
- Cheers, bitch.

42:59.333 --> 43:00.767
- All right, cheers, bitch.
[both laugh]

43:01.000 --> 43:02.200
- Look how far out
my husband is.

43:02.233 --> 43:03.500
- Oh, (BLEEP).
Oh, sh--.

43:03.533 --> 43:07.266
- About to get married again.
This is number two!

43:07.300 --> 43:09.100
- Maybe I've got kids
floating around out there.

43:09.133 --> 43:11.000
Who knows?

43:12.734 --> 43:15.200
all: Yeah!

43:15.233 --> 43:18.066
- I feel so rich.
- You are.

43:18.100 --> 43:20.433
- Careful, ladies.

43:20.467 --> 43:22.633
- Those women still love you.

43:22.667 --> 43:24.734
- You don't treat people
you love like that.

43:24.767 --> 43:26.333
- She's gonna make herself
the victim.

43:26.367 --> 43:28.400
She's gonna turn it all around.
Everyone else is wrong.

43:28.433 --> 43:30.767
- Kim, you giving Lisa Rinna
that bunny

43:31.000 --> 43:33.066
was really sh--.

43:33.100 --> 43:34.633
- It's gonna get nasty.

43:34.667 --> 43:36.333
- You know what?
(BLEEP) off, Camille.

43:36.367 --> 43:39.100
- Let me have a conversation
with Kyle for two seconds.

43:39.133 --> 43:40.166
- Are you trying
to push me out?

43:40.200 --> 43:41.300
- No.

43:41.333 --> 43:43.200
- You guys want
to make up sh--?

43:43.233 --> 43:45.066
Good.
- Sh--.

43:45.100 --> 43:48.233
It's like some horror movie.
I gotta get out of here.

43:48.266 --> 43:50.400
- Cut yourself
some ----ing slack.

43:50.433 --> 43:52.500
- I've never cut
myself slack, ever.

43:52.533 --> 43:55.133
- You know--
- No, I don't know,

43:55.166 --> 43:56.667
Denise, so back off.

43:56.700 --> 43:59.100
- Yeah. You do.
You ----ing back off.

43:59.133 --> 44:02.266

- Coming in hot, baby.
