01:13.481 --> 01:14.485
Get them.
That's it.

01:14.486 --> 01:15.993
Come on.
Nail them.

01:15.994 --> 01:16.997
Yeah !

01:16.998 --> 01:18.002
Go get 'em ! 

01:19.343 --> 01:22.022
What do you think
you're doing, Donatello ?

01:22.023 --> 01:23.763
We're watching something.

01:23.764 --> 01:27.447
Yeah. An ace duck film festival.

01:27.448 --> 01:30.630
April's doing a special report
she wants us to watch.

01:30.631 --> 01:32.070
This is April O'Neill

01:32.071 --> 01:34.080
at the army testing laboratory,

01:34.081 --> 01:35.085
about to bring you

01:35.086 --> 01:36.659
the first public demonstration

01:36.660 --> 01:38.702
of a new super laser.

01:43.392 --> 01:44.697
Sorry...

01:44.698 --> 01:46.104
Interruption, folks...

01:46.105 --> 01:47.712
Electrical storm.

01:47.713 --> 01:48.884
Dudes,

01:48.885 --> 01:52.234
Am I glad i'm not out in this rain.

01:52.235 --> 01:55.182
You're part turtle.
You love water.

01:55.183 --> 01:57.828
Totally bogus concept, bud.

01:59.370 --> 02:02.449
This is the laser's power source.

02:02.450 --> 02:05.398
The electrical energy required 
is enormous,

02:05.399 --> 02:07.575
1.3 gigawatts.

02:07.576 --> 02:10.253
Fantabuloso.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.264
How much is a gigawatt ?

02:12.265 --> 02:14.441
Let me put it this way:
you wouldn't want it

02:14.442 --> 02:16.283
to show up on your light bill.

02:16.284 --> 02:18.628
This laser beam can cut
through any material

02:18.629 --> 02:20.403
known to man.

02:22.649 --> 02:24.490
Now the laser will be
turned up to full power

02:24.491 --> 02:27.437
to cut through this

02:41.137 --> 02:42.442
look out !

02:44.956 --> 02:48.170
A bolt of lightning just 
overloaded the laser.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.323
Hold on.
Something just arrived

02:52.324 --> 02:55.808
from some sort of space in space.

02:55.809 --> 02:59.023
What a ride.

02:59.024 --> 03:00.630
I wonder where I am.

03:04.048 --> 03:05.856
That creature !

03:05.857 --> 03:07.363
What is it ?

03:07.364 --> 03:10.679
It must be an enemy alien.
Take it down.

03:12.589 --> 03:15.268
Inhabitants shooting at one another.

03:15.269 --> 03:17.679
This can only be earth.

03:21.298 --> 03:23.340
Hey, what's the story ?

03:23.341 --> 03:24.345
I don't know.

03:24.346 --> 03:26.388
But I ain't waiting for no sequel.

03:26.389 --> 03:27.359
That thing is getting out of hand.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.968
We've got to stop it.

03:33.222 --> 03:34.829
That tickles.

03:39.955 --> 03:42.767
An extremely ancient laser model.

03:42.768 --> 03:45.145
I hope it wasn't a family heirloom.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.504
What is this thing ?

03:50.505 --> 03:52.313
Whatever it is, I know someone

03:52.314 --> 03:53.821
who'd love to get his hands on it.

03:53.822 --> 03:55.194
You mean...

03:55.195 --> 03:56.567
Who else ?

03:58.611 --> 04:01.625
I want that robot.

04:01.626 --> 04:03.902
Now, Krang,

04:03.903 --> 04:06.850
You can't have everything you 
see on TV.

04:06.851 --> 04:08.826
If you're real good,

04:08.827 --> 04:11.773
maybe you'll get one for christmas.

04:13.616 --> 04:16.630
Quiet, you mutant morons !

04:16.630 --> 04:19.745
I've never seen such a robot.

04:19.745 --> 04:22.659
It's invulnerable
to laser weapons.

04:22.660 --> 04:26.142
It's not from any world I know.

04:26.143 --> 04:28.320
Wait, did you see that ?

04:28.321 --> 04:29.727
It's called a neck.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.171
Something i'm sure
you'd like to have.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.617
Just because I'm all brain

04:34.618 --> 04:37.866
doesn't mean I don't have feelings.

04:37.867 --> 04:39.307
This robot's neck

04:39.308 --> 04:42.723
is possibly its only vulnerable spot.

04:42.724 --> 04:46.073
If you can place
this docilator on its neck,

04:46.074 --> 04:49.020
it will override the robot's 
programming

04:49.021 --> 04:51.163
so we can control it.

04:51.164 --> 04:53.642
Imagine an entire army

04:53.643 --> 04:57.226
of invincible robots
from another dimension...

04:57.227 --> 05:00.676
All eager to serve me.

05:00.677 --> 05:01.848
This is something

05:01.849 --> 05:04.361
you just happened to have
lying around, right.

05:04.362 --> 05:08.212
We've got to keep
the story moving.

05:08.213 --> 05:08.882
Remember...

05:08.883 --> 05:12.801
The will not last long.

05:12.802 --> 05:16.318
You must return with
the robot immediately.

05:16.319 --> 05:20.338
Don't worry.
We shall not fail.

05:20.339 --> 05:23.117
I wish I had a Dimension X dollar

05:23.118 --> 05:26.132
for every time I've heard that.

05:26.133 --> 05:28.811
It looks like the army really wants

05:28.812 --> 05:30.118
this robot intruder...

05:30.119 --> 05:31.391
Badly.

05:31.392 --> 05:33.065
Howdy, ma'am.

05:34.172 --> 05:36.080
What are you doing ?

05:36.081 --> 05:39.262
I'm rescuing you
from comanches.

05:39.263 --> 05:40.535
April's in serious trouble.

05:40.536 --> 05:41.774
I'll say.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.554
She's got to listen to
that bad cowboy dialect.

05:44.555 --> 05:46.530
Let's go, turtles.

05:49.177 --> 05:52.191
Put me down, you big lug.

05:52.192 --> 05:55.272
You heard the lady.
Put her down.

05:55.273 --> 05:58.957
Oh, turtles, am I glad to see you.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.637
More hostile earthlings...

06:01.638 --> 06:03.211
or something.

06:07.332 --> 06:09.373
So much for the direct approach.

06:09.374 --> 06:10.513
I've got an idea.

06:10.514 --> 06:12.020
Michelangelo and I

06:12.021 --> 06:13.527
will keep that thing busy

06:13.528 --> 06:16.039
while you and Donatello
attack from behind.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.953
Taste hot lead, you sidewinders.

06:25.654 --> 06:30.274
Are you no-good polecats
trying to bushwhack me ?

06:30.275 --> 06:31.950
At least get it right.

06:31.951 --> 06:33.121
We're turtles.

06:33.122 --> 06:35.567
Michelangelo, what are you doing ?

06:35.568 --> 06:38.045
I'm going to try something.

06:38.046 --> 06:39.888
Yo, bro !

06:39.889 --> 06:41.362
Peace, dude.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.247
Peace, dude.

06:45.248 --> 06:46.687
All right.

06:46.688 --> 06:48.597
Give me three.

06:51.377 --> 06:52.716
What's your name ?

06:52.717 --> 06:54.961
And like, where'd
You come from ?

06:54.962 --> 06:56.367
I am macc--

06:56.368 --> 06:59.482
Mobile armored
Computerized combatant

06:59.483 --> 07:02.161
And i am from sector 4,
Level 8.

07:02.162 --> 07:04.272
Sector 4, level 8 ?

07:04.273 --> 07:07.019
What year is this,
Macc ?

07:07.020 --> 07:09.296
A piece of seaweed cake.

07:09.297 --> 07:11.876
It's now 2390 a.d.

07:11.877 --> 07:15.995
He's from 400 years
In the future.

07:15.996 --> 07:17.971
We've got company.

07:19.748 --> 07:22.829
I'll handle these galoots.

07:27.217 --> 07:29.560
So much for those
Bushwhackers.

07:29.561 --> 07:31.670
Listen, macc,
It's not safe here.

07:31.671 --> 07:33.479
You'd better come
With us.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.489
Be my pleasure,
Partners.

07:35.490 --> 07:38.436
How come you talk
Like a cowboy, macc ?

07:38.437 --> 07:39.609
There's nothing
To watch

07:39.610 --> 07:41.686
On those long
Interdimensional trips

07:41.687 --> 07:44.131
Except ancient
Western movies.

07:45.706 --> 07:47.146
Going down.

07:48.151 --> 07:49.323
What happened ?

07:49.324 --> 07:53.509
Ain't we a couple
Of cutups ?

07:53.510 --> 07:57.428
This robot is under
My control now, turtles.

07:57.429 --> 08:01.046
I am under
Your control.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.725
Oh, great.
Shredder just grabbed

08:03.726 --> 08:06.305
The most powerful
Weapon on earth.

08:06.306 --> 08:08.683
Major bummer.

08:14.612 --> 08:17.492
They've got macc.
We've got to stop them.

08:17.493 --> 08:19.769
Destroy the turtles.

08:19.770 --> 08:22.248
Destroy the turtles.

08:22.249 --> 08:23.756
Oh, no.

08:23.757 --> 08:25.463
It's going to fire.

08:28.446 --> 08:30.354
Didn't you hear me ?

08:30.355 --> 08:32.464
I said destroy
The turtles.

08:34.676 --> 08:36.215
I reckon you <I>hombres

08:36.216 --> 08:38.962
Are  headed for
The last roundup.

08:38.962 --> 08:41.039
The docilator failed.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.479
Dance, you varmints.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.818
Dance.

08:43.820 --> 08:45.359
Sure thing. Um...

08:45.360 --> 08:48.843
You want a waltz
Or fox trot ?

08:48.844 --> 08:51.757
You can even lead
If you want.

08:51.758 --> 08:54.168
Shredder and those creeps
Are getting away.

08:54.169 --> 08:57.518
So what else is new ?

08:57.519 --> 08:58.824
Are you ok ?

08:58.825 --> 09:00.667
We thought your diodes
Got scrambled

09:00.668 --> 09:02.643
By that device
Of shredder's.

09:02.644 --> 09:05.892
I did feel a bit
Reprogrammed for a moment,

09:05.893 --> 09:07.533
But i didn't like
Those fellows.

09:07.534 --> 09:09.175
They're too violent.

09:09.176 --> 09:11.017
You don't like violence ?

09:11.018 --> 09:13.696
But you're programmed
To be a warrior.

09:13.697 --> 09:16.442
I was a factory reject.

09:16.443 --> 09:19.391
Oh, i'd love to do
An interview with him.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.471
<I>macc--the robot warrior
<I>from the future...

09:22.472 --> 09:24.917
An april o'neill
Exclusive.

09:24.918 --> 09:27.931
Gosh. I feel so important.

09:27.932 --> 09:29.405
Make it fast, april.

09:29.406 --> 09:32.319
The army's going
To be after him.

09:32.320 --> 09:35.301
Another failure,
Shredder ?

09:35.302 --> 09:38.248
You have an almost
Perfect record.

09:38.249 --> 09:42.401
If that stupid docilator
Of yours had worked--

09:42.402 --> 09:45.885
I'm tired of
Your miserable excuses.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.665
I've made a new
And improved docilator--

09:48.666 --> 09:50.574
I'm tired of
One that cannot fail.s.

09:50.575 --> 09:53.120
Then you shall
Have the robot.

09:53.121 --> 09:54.493
I vow it.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.670
Cross your heart
And hope to die ?

09:56.671 --> 09:57.776
What heart ?

09:57.777 --> 10:01.091
Shredder,
You're my kind of guy.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.709
Great interview,
Macc.

10:04.710 --> 10:06.819
Glad to oblige,
Ma'am.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.728
Now let's get going.

10:08.729 --> 10:10.738
Hold on.

10:10.739 --> 10:14.556
Number five,
What brings you here ?

10:14.557 --> 10:16.868
Macc, that's
A tv camera.

10:16.869 --> 10:19.078
Oh, how weird.

10:19.079 --> 10:21.757
It looks just like
My brother.

10:21.758 --> 10:24.772
This sure beats
Riding the subway.

10:24.773 --> 10:26.681
So much to learn.

10:26.682 --> 10:28.791
I need to learn more.

10:28.792 --> 10:31.806
Which way is your nearest
Data bank repository ?

10:31.807 --> 10:33.916
Data bank repository ?

10:33.917 --> 10:36.462
He means
The public library.

10:36.463 --> 10:38.572
That way.
That way.

10:38.573 --> 10:40.984
Great ninjas, yes.

10:40.985 --> 10:43.027
Great readers, no.

10:43.028 --> 10:44.701
They have
A security guard

10:44.702 --> 10:46.276
So keep it quiet.

10:46.277 --> 10:49.458
Truly fascinating.

10:49.459 --> 10:51.133
Awesome !

10:51.134 --> 10:53.243
Talk about
Your speed reading.

10:53.244 --> 10:54.917
Hey, you !

10:54.918 --> 10:56.290
What do you guys
Think you're doing ?

10:56.291 --> 10:57.731
Hey, you !

10:57.732 --> 11:00.678
And having a wonderful
Time doing it.

11:00.679 --> 11:03.693
A wise guy, huh ?
I'll input you.

11:03.694 --> 11:04.765
No problem, sir.

11:04.766 --> 11:06.707
Uh, we'll pick up
All these books.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.019
Come on, fellas, pitch in.

11:09.020 --> 11:10.626
Wait a minute.

11:10.627 --> 11:12.468
You're that robot
The army's looking for.

11:12.469 --> 11:15.718
Yes. It's nice
To be wanted.

11:15.719 --> 11:17.895
And you're the crooks
Who swiped it.

11:17.896 --> 11:20.240
There will be
No violence.

11:24.930 --> 11:26.436
That was fun.

11:26.437 --> 11:27.642
I think it's time

11:27.643 --> 11:29.786
We checked out
Of this library.

11:29.787 --> 11:31.728
In fact,
We're overdue.

11:31.729 --> 11:34.408
Stop, you creeps,
Come back.

11:34.409 --> 11:37.423
It appears you kind
Of blew it, dude.

11:37.424 --> 11:40.169
But that guard was about
To become violent.

11:40.170 --> 11:42.347
I detest violence.

11:42.348 --> 11:43.954
I kind of feel
The same way

11:43.955 --> 11:45.562
About underwear
With hearts on 'em.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.318
This is our <I>sensei
Splinter.

11:50.319 --> 11:52.228
Howdy, partner.

11:52.229 --> 11:54.739
howdy.

11:54.740 --> 11:57.352
Hey, come see
My workshop, macc.

11:57.353 --> 11:59.763
I've got lots more
Data to amass.

11:59.764 --> 12:03.281
All right !
Amass mondo data.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.903
You pack quite a wallop.

12:07.904 --> 12:09.846
Sorry. Since my arrival,

12:09.847 --> 12:13.229
My circuits
Don't feel quite right.

12:16.746 --> 12:18.855
W-what happened ?

12:18.856 --> 12:21.468
It appears your
Primitive image receiver

12:21.469 --> 12:23.612
Just bit the dust.

12:23.613 --> 12:24.817
Primitive ?

12:24.818 --> 12:28.536
We've still got
28 payments left.

12:28.537 --> 12:31.081
I've run a few tests
On macc,

12:31.082 --> 12:33.024
And that trip
Through time

12:33.025 --> 12:34.531
Must've done something
To his circuits.

12:34.532 --> 12:36.775
They're deteriorating
Rapidly.

12:36.776 --> 12:38.952
So, what does that mean ?

12:38.953 --> 12:41.365
It means that he's
Becoming a real danger

12:41.366 --> 12:43.374
To himself
And others.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.886
He's going
To blow up.

12:45.887 --> 12:48.599
I cannot harm
My friends.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.441
I must disappear.

12:55.131 --> 12:56.772
Bushwhackers.

13:00.055 --> 13:02.131
This will
Slow you down.

13:04.410 --> 13:08.193
You will go to the surface
And wait for me.

13:08.194 --> 13:10.874
Ooh, but, boss,
Krang told us

13:10.875 --> 13:14.457
To bring the robot
Back to the technodrome.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.802
He'll get his plaything
Soon enough.

13:16.803 --> 13:20.720
After i've amused myself
For a while.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.338
Fellas, macc is gone.

13:24.339 --> 13:26.012
He must've heard us
Talking about him.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.520
He won't last 5 minutes

13:27.521 --> 13:28.961
Out there
In the big city.

13:28.962 --> 13:31.372
He is an innocent
In our world.

13:31.373 --> 13:33.382
He could cause
Great harm.

13:33.383 --> 13:36.932
Yeah, especially to anyone
Near him when he explodes.

13:39.010 --> 13:41.253
A great interview,
April.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.526
Thanks, chief.

13:42.527 --> 13:44.368
Viewers will love
The gimmick

13:44.369 --> 13:46.043
Of a peace-loving
Military robot

13:46.044 --> 13:47.282
From the future.

13:47.283 --> 13:50.163
We just got word that
Some berserko robot

13:50.164 --> 13:52.709
Is attacking
A police station.

13:52.710 --> 13:53.982
Macc !

13:53.983 --> 13:57.598
Ooh ! So much for your
Peace-loving robot.

13:57.599 --> 13:59.440
Where are you going ?

13:59.441 --> 14:01.317
To cover that story...

14:01.318 --> 14:03.795
AND TO WARN THE TURTLES.

14:05.237 --> 14:07.747
Chaos. Destruction.

14:07.748 --> 14:09.388
I love it.

14:11.835 --> 14:13.006
Hurry, fellas.

14:13.007 --> 14:14.916
Macc is on a rampage.

14:14.917 --> 14:16.925
We see him, april.
Thanks.

14:16.926 --> 14:19.370
Scope it out, dudes.

14:19.371 --> 14:21.547
Looks like nuke city.

14:23.793 --> 14:26.303
I can't believe
Macc would do this.

14:26.304 --> 14:28.481
Believe it.

14:28.482 --> 14:29.485
Attack !

14:29.486 --> 14:31.495
Destroy the turtles.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.003
It's shredder.

14:33.004 --> 14:35.950
He's got macc
Under his control.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.032
He's about
To open fire.

14:47.641 --> 14:49.382
Hit the pavement !

14:50.991 --> 14:54.841
I love the smell
Of lasers in the morning.

14:58.326 --> 15:01.841
He sure has changed from
The macc we used to know.

15:01.842 --> 15:04.019
I kind of liked
The old one better.

15:04.020 --> 15:05.526
More targets.

15:05.527 --> 15:08.842
I want
More targets.

15:08.843 --> 15:10.784
Wow. What a scene.

15:17.485 --> 15:19.091
April, you ok ?

15:19.092 --> 15:20.264
Forget me.

15:20.265 --> 15:23.178
Look what that crazy robot
Did to my camera.

15:23.179 --> 15:24.618
Macc can't help it.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.962
That device shredder's
Using to control him

15:26.963 --> 15:28.470
Is speeding things up.

15:28.471 --> 15:31.384
He could self-destruct
At any moment.

15:31.385 --> 15:33.327
I'd kind of like to be
Out of the neighborhood

15:33.328 --> 15:34.835
When he goes kaboom.

15:34.836 --> 15:37.514
It won't matter
What neighborhood you're in.

15:37.515 --> 15:40.193
There's enough
Destructive force in macc

15:40.194 --> 15:42.370
To level this entire city.

15:42.371 --> 15:44.782
Shredder, bring
That robot down here

15:44.783 --> 15:47.629
Before the turtles
Find you.

15:47.630 --> 15:50.610
Those retched reptiles
Will never find me.

15:50.611 --> 15:52.820
I've changed my image.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.295
Look,
While those turtles

15:54.296 --> 15:56.305
Are searching
Abandoned warehouses

15:56.306 --> 15:58.616
And roach-infested
Tenements,

15:58.617 --> 16:01.161
I'll be luxuriating
Here.

16:01.162 --> 16:05.381
Just how are you paying
For all this ?

16:05.382 --> 16:07.491
I borrowed your
Alien express card.

16:07.492 --> 16:10.238
I never leave
Technodrome without it.

16:14.024 --> 16:16.535
Macc must've gone
This way.

16:16.536 --> 16:19.617
It looks like
The dude's gone bad.

16:23.570 --> 16:26.182
Well, maybe not all bad.

16:26.183 --> 16:27.924
Hmm, i've got a feeling

16:27.925 --> 16:29.733
That macc is
Purposely leaving us

16:29.734 --> 16:31.273
A trail to follow.

16:31.274 --> 16:33.282
I hope you're right.

16:36.465 --> 16:39.982
Something tells me
This is the place.

16:39.983 --> 16:41.992
You and your
Nutty hunches.

16:41.993 --> 16:43.766
Let's go, turtles.

16:45.208 --> 16:48.021
I'm ruined.

16:48.022 --> 16:49.527
That's the last time

16:49.528 --> 16:52.877
I rent a room to
A bunch of bachelors.

16:52.878 --> 16:54.619
Do you know
Which way they went ?

16:54.620 --> 16:56.227
Need you ask ?

16:56.228 --> 16:59.543
They left a trail
Of burn marks...

16:59.544 --> 17:01.586
And it leads
To the basement.

17:01.587 --> 17:02.590
Makes sense.

17:02.591 --> 17:05.036
Shredder is always
Sinking to new depths.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.285
A transport module.

17:08.286 --> 17:10.127
And it's getting away.

17:10.127 --> 17:13.878
But they left a spare.

17:15.888 --> 17:20.242
We've got to get past
Those foot soldiers first.

17:20.242 --> 17:22.788
Allow me, guys.

17:22.789 --> 17:24.261
Hey, dudes.

17:24.262 --> 17:26.707
Don't forget
Your luggage.

17:26.708 --> 17:28.951
Quick.
Everyone inside.

17:30.559 --> 17:33.071
You sure you can drive
One of these things ?

17:33.072 --> 17:34.310
How tough can it be ?

17:34.311 --> 17:36.755
Bebop and rock steady
Do it all the time.

17:41.915 --> 17:43.621
Here's the plan.

17:43.622 --> 17:45.631
When the time portal opens,

17:45.632 --> 17:48.445
You will lead an army
Of your fellow robots

17:48.446 --> 17:50.890
Back into this dimension.

17:50.891 --> 17:53.068
Yes, master.

17:53.069 --> 17:56.350
Ooh, i love the sound
Of that word.

17:56.351 --> 17:59.867
Soon i will have
An army of eager robots

17:59.868 --> 18:01.709
At my command.

18:01.710 --> 18:04.455
But the energy drain
Will destroy that one.

18:04.456 --> 18:05.561
Good.

18:05.562 --> 18:08.241
Then we'll no longer
Have to listen

18:08.242 --> 18:11.590
To his atrocious
Cowboy dialect.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.097
What's that ?

18:13.098 --> 18:16.815
Incoming
Transport module.

18:16.816 --> 18:18.791
It's carrying
The turtles.

18:18.792 --> 18:21.304
Coming to rescue
Their robot friend,

18:21.305 --> 18:22.542
No doubt.

18:22.543 --> 18:25.993
We should make our
Uninvited guests feel welcome.

18:25.994 --> 18:27.333
Foot soldiers,

18:27.334 --> 18:30.280
Front and center
On the double.

18:32.894 --> 18:35.539
I wonder where
Everyone is.

18:35.540 --> 18:37.046
They could have
At least

18:37.047 --> 18:40.027
Left the light
On for us.

18:40.028 --> 18:42.841
Ooh. Surprise.

18:44.818 --> 18:47.999
Pretty bizarro place,
Huh, dudes ?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.382
Yeah, it's like
A cartoonist's nightmare.

18:51.383 --> 18:53.224
I heard that.

18:53.225 --> 18:56.138
Your nightmares
Have just begun.

18:56.139 --> 18:57.813
Soon your
Robotic friend

18:57.814 --> 19:00.057
Will return
To his dimension

19:00.058 --> 19:04.880
And bring back an army
Of super warriors.

19:04.881 --> 19:06.790
You can't do that
To macc.

19:06.791 --> 19:08.028
Can't i ?

19:08.029 --> 19:10.407
Just watch.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.445
Don't fret, partners.

19:18.446 --> 19:21.460
We've got the drop
On these varmints.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.805
He's free
Of krang's control.

19:23.806 --> 19:26.418
Fabuloso.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.240
Yeah !
Yeah !

19:33.922 --> 19:35.930
Ahh, we did it.

19:35.931 --> 19:39.112
Those blasted turtles.
They're loose.

19:39.113 --> 19:41.188
Well, don't just
Stand there,

19:41.189 --> 19:42.629
You bug brains,

19:42.630 --> 19:44.069
Get them.

19:49.262 --> 19:50.768
All right, macc.
Way to go, buddy !

19:50.769 --> 19:51.840
Thanks.

19:51.841 --> 19:53.749
Hey, thanks, dude.

19:53.750 --> 19:56.361
No problemo, dude.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.841
Where are my
Rock soldiers ?

19:58.842 --> 19:59.778
Attack.

20:03.866 --> 20:07.616
Why--you can't
Do this to me !

20:09.861 --> 20:12.071
Macc, behind you !

20:23.024 --> 20:25.737
The time portal--
It's open.

20:25.738 --> 20:28.249
Macc,
You better boogie.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.225
I don't want to go back.

20:30.226 --> 20:33.106
Too much war
And violence.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.445
Listen up, amigo.

20:34.446 --> 20:37.795
If you don't go,
You're going to blow.

20:37.796 --> 20:40.206
Hey, you can be
A warrior for peace

20:40.207 --> 20:41.714
In your own era.

20:41.715 --> 20:45.432
A warrior for peace.
I like it.

20:45.433 --> 20:47.676
Adios, partners.

20:47.677 --> 20:50.255
i'm an old cowhand

20:50.256 --> 20:52.366
from the rio grande

20:53.572 --> 20:58.361
My treasured I

20:58.362 --> 21:02.112
that'll teach you to mess with us.

21:02.113 --> 21:04.524
Yeah. We're lean, we're green,

21:04.525 --> 21:06.434
And we're mean.

21:08.545 --> 21:10.553
Scarf this one down, dudes.

21:10.554 --> 21:12.897
There's more pizza
coming right up.

21:12.898 --> 21:15.075
I'm glad macc got
back to his own era.

21:15.076 --> 21:17.620
I'm glad he was on our side.

21:17.621 --> 21:21.975
Yeah, that dude could
really sling a mean laser.

21:21.976 --> 21:24.118
Macc was a good friend,

21:24.119 --> 21:26.564
but he belongs in his own time.

21:26.565 --> 21:28.138
Yeah, Splinter's right.

21:28.139 --> 21:30.415
He could have done a lot
of damage if he'd stayed.

21:32.426 --> 21:34.602
Oh, no.
The pizza.

21:36.847 --> 21:38.890
Oh, what a bummer.

21:38.891 --> 21:41.033
Who needs macc
to cause damage ?

21:41.034 --> 21:43.311
We've got Michelangelo.
