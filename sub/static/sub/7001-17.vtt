01:11.709 --> 01:14.009
Good night, everybody.
See you next time.

01:14.110 --> 01:16.570
- Nice going, Al.
- It wasn't my fault.

01:16.669 --> 01:19.050
- Yes, it was.
- No, it wasn't.

01:21.269 --> 01:23.259
Thanks for wrecking another show, Al.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.140
Well, you're the one that stuck your foot
in the joint compound, Tim.

01:26.229 --> 01:27.739
That you left right behind me on purpose.

01:27.830 --> 01:29.050
- I did not.
- Did too.

01:29.150 --> 01:30.699
- Not.
- Too!

01:30.790 --> 01:34.219
Could you help me
out of the bucket, please.

01:34.310 --> 01:37.540
- OK, here. Brace yourself.
- Al, Al, Al, Al, Al, Al!

01:37.630 --> 01:40.820
Tim, Tim, Tim!
Mr Binford's looking for you.

01:40.909 --> 01:43.140
Oh, great! Great!

01:43.229 --> 01:46.380
The sponsor shows up,
and I'm stuck in a bucket.

01:46.469 --> 01:48.540
Al, thanks for the book.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.419
It means a lot to me.

01:50.509 --> 01:52.300
Oh, Al.

01:54.229 --> 01:56.259
- What was that all about?
- Nothing, Tim.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.860
It's just she and I are both
big Bob Vila fans.

01:59.949 --> 02:02.409
You know, he's in town
signing his new book.

02:02.909 --> 02:07.340
Isn't that wonderful! Let's get
my shoe out of the bucket, please.

02:07.429 --> 02:12.290
Well, I can't believe it. I actually got
to talk to the pioneer in home repair.

02:12.390 --> 02:13.860
The pioneer?

02:13.949 --> 02:17.540
Without Bob Vila, there would be
no Tool Time. He paved the way.

02:17.630 --> 02:23.659
Listen, Al. Any paving done on Tool Time's
done by me, the big asphalt.

02:23.749 --> 02:26.580
Taylor! Oh. Taylor!

02:26.669 --> 02:29.659
- Back here, Mr Binford.
- Hi, Borland.

02:33.870 --> 02:37.620
- Boy, have I got a surprise for you.
- Well, great, boss.

02:37.709 --> 02:40.540
Guess who's gonna be on the show
tomorrow afternoon.

02:40.630 --> 02:42.620
Bob Vila.

02:43.669 --> 02:46.100
- Really?
- Hell of a idea, isn't it?

02:46.189 --> 02:49.340
Great.
He's the pioneer of home repair.

02:49.429 --> 02:51.810
Darn right.
We'll sell some tools too.

02:51.909 --> 02:54.469
Oops. I see a vision.

02:56.550 --> 02:58.659
- A competition.
- A competition?

02:58.749 --> 03:04.380
friendly but fierce.
Between our Taylor and Bob Vila.

03:04.469 --> 03:07.300
We'll call it "Stump the Tool Man".

03:07.390 --> 03:11.169
- A very good idea, Mr Binford.
- Don't suck up to me, Borland.

03:11.269 --> 03:13.780
Every red-blooded male will be calling in.

03:13.870 --> 03:18.459
wanting to know if Taylor or Bob Vila
is king of the home repair.

03:19.269 --> 03:22.340
John, do we really need
competition on the show?

03:22.429 --> 03:25.580
You're not afraid, are you, Timmy?

03:26.870 --> 03:28.820
Of Bob Vila? No, no, no.

03:28.909 --> 03:32.659
Good. You'll represent me -
be selling a hell of lot of tools.

03:32.749 --> 03:36.370
Have yourself a good time
and kick Bob's butt.

03:39.070 --> 03:41.820
OK. "Stump the Tool Man".
Ask me a hard one.

03:41.909 --> 03:45.060
OK. You're attaching mo-by-fours
to a concrete foundation.

03:45.150 --> 03:47.739
- What tool do you use?
- Piece of cake.

03:47.830 --> 03:52.259
Electropneumatic rotary hammer drill.
Low vibration, variable speeds. Yes!

03:52.350 --> 03:54.699
- Come on, another one - hard one.
- Come on, Tim. Give it a rest.

03:54.790 --> 03:58.459
There's no way you are ever gonna
know all the stuff in these books.

03:58.550 --> 04:01.009
Honey, Bob Vila knows everything
in those books.

04:01.110 --> 04:04.419
That's because he wrote most of them.

04:06.030 --> 04:08.590
That sure makes me feel better.

04:08.669 --> 04:12.100
Are you afraid big, bad Bob
is gonna make you look foolish?

04:12.189 --> 04:16.100
Better men than him
have made me look foolish.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.978
That didn't sound right, did it?

04:18.070 --> 04:20.449
- Ask me another question.
- Wait a sec.

04:21.550 --> 04:23.060
o .

04:23.150 --> 04:25.380
Oh, hello, Mrs Woolitt.

04:28.949 --> 04:31.780
He did what?

04:31.870 --> 04:36.219
Oh. I am so sorry.
Well. I promise it'll never happen again.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.620
Listen. I'll send him over right away
to apologize.

04:39.709 --> 04:43.459
Oh, you did?
Oh, well. OK. That'll be fine.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.179
Thanks. Goodbye.

04:45.269 --> 04:47.620
Randall William Taylor, get in here.
I wanna talk to you.

04:47.709 --> 04:50.090
Middle name. He's in trouble.

04:51.189 --> 04:54.219
Randy yanked the shoes off
of a kid at school

04:54.310 --> 04:56.979
and filled them with Cheez Whiz.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.219
Mom, you don't understand.
He's a total geek.

05:02.310 --> 05:05.850
- Don't call him that.
- What am I supposed to call him?

05:05.949 --> 05:08.019
How about "the whiz kid"?

05:08.110 --> 05:09.739
Tim!

05:09.830 --> 05:11.939
Well, cheese and everything…

05:12.030 --> 05:15.419
Randy, this is not like you.
Why would you do something like this?

05:15.509 --> 05:18.620
Mom. Curtis is
the most annoying kid on Earth.

05:18.709 --> 05:22.219
- It's true. He drives everybody crazy.
- Well. I don't care.

05:22.310 --> 05:26.419
Curtis is coming over here,
and I want you to apologize to him.

05:26.509 --> 05:30.209
- OK, honey. Ask me another one.
- All right. One more, and that is all.

05:30.310 --> 05:32.540
What is an adze?

05:32.630 --> 05:34.659
A-d-z-e.

05:34.749 --> 05:37.620
- That's a tool?
- Yeah, it's right here.

05:37.709 --> 05:41.459
"Adze: a medieval wood-shaping tool."

05:41.989 --> 05:45.259
Get real. What are the chances somebody
will call and ask about that?

05:45.350 --> 05:47.650
Might be good.
If I'm the one calling.

05:47.749 --> 05:49.739
.   .  y.

05:49.830 --> 05:51.540
pretty sly.

05:51.630 --> 05:53.979
What are the chances
Bob Vila's gonna know that?

05:54.070 --> 05:56.259
I know why I love you sometimes.

05:56.350 --> 06:01.499
Look, in case I get in trouble. I'm gonna
look at the camera. I'll scratch like this.

06:01.590 --> 06:03.580
and I'll say.
"Let's go to a female caller:'

06:03.669 --> 06:08.300
You call this number, and Kathy will patch
you right through the switchboard to me.

06:08.390 --> 06:09.860
OK.

06:09.949 --> 06:12.979
That must be Curtis.
Randy!

06:14.150 --> 06:17.300
- Come on, Mark. Let's get out of here.
- I want to meet him.

06:17.390 --> 06:19.580
No, you don't.
He's a bigger geek than you are.

06:19.669 --> 06:21.659
wow!.

06:24.509 --> 06:29.979
Curtis. I believe that Randy
has something that he wants to say to you.

06:30.749 --> 06:33.310
Sorry about the Cheez Whiz.

06:33.390 --> 06:36.620
Thanks. I feel much better now.

06:36.709 --> 06:39.699
- Curtis, this is Randy's dad, Mr Taylor.
- Hi, Curtis. How are you?

06:39.790 --> 06:42.459
- My father and I watch Tool Time.
- Good.

06:42.550 --> 06:44.580
We really like Al.

06:47.550 --> 06:49.820
We all like Al.

06:50.550 --> 06:52.419
He is a geek.

06:52.509 --> 06:54.259
See ya, female caller.

06:54.350 --> 06:57.140
Good luck, big, bad Tim.

06:58.150 --> 07:00.709
May I please have something to drink?

07:00.790 --> 07:03.979
Yeah, Randy, would you
get your guest a soda?

07:04.070 --> 07:07.259
Mrs Taylor, you look
a lot older than my mom.

07:10.989 --> 07:13.860
How old are you?

07:13.949 --> 07:16.300
Old enough not to answer that question.

07:16.390 --> 07:18.659
That's what my grandma says.

07:34.269 --> 07:37.459
Thank you. Welcome, everybody.
This is Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

07:37.550 --> 07:40.979
and welcome to a special live edition
of Tool Time. Today on the show we're…

07:41.070 --> 07:43.979
It's special
because we have a very special guest.

07:44.070 --> 07:47.380
Why don't we let the audience decide
how special the guest is, Al?

07:47.469 --> 07:49.659
I'm sure a lot of you have seen his show
and maybe read his books.

07:49.749 --> 07:52.540
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Mr Bob Vila.

08:04.229 --> 08:07.100
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

08:10.989 --> 08:14.100
What a great audience.
A just wonderful audience.

08:15.110 --> 08:18.780
Thank you. It's just so great
to be here on your show. Jim.

08:18.870 --> 08:20.780
It's Tim.

08:20.870 --> 08:23.330
- I'd like you to meet my assistant.
- Oh, Al and I've met.

08:23.429 --> 08:26.939
- How you doing? Good to see you again.
- The pleasure is mine, Mr Vila.

08:27.030 --> 08:29.620
- Call me Bob.
- I can't.

08:30.630 --> 08:33.188
Well, why don't we get started.
Bob, you can sit down over here.

08:33.269 --> 08:36.499
Before we get to our project,
we have a little friendly competition

08:36.590 --> 08:38.100
called "Stump the Tool Man."

08:38.188 --> 08:39.620
- Oh, that'll be fun.
- It sure will.

08:39.708 --> 08:42.140
Now, if you have any questions
about home improvement or tools.

08:42.229 --> 08:44.939
I want you to call 555-TOOL.

08:45.030 --> 08:49.380
That's 555 T-O-O-L.

08:52.070 --> 08:55.340
Why don't we go to that first caller?

08:55.429 --> 08:58.580
- Hi. This is Clarence.
- Hi. Clarence. What's your problem?

08:58.669 --> 09:02.290
My wife is always changing her mind
where pictures should be hung.

09:02.390 --> 09:05.019
Hey, we can't help with that. Women can
never make up their minds, can they?

09:05.110 --> 09:06.249
Tell me about it.

09:06.350 --> 09:10.739
Our walls are so full of holes,
they're starting to look like Swiss cheese.

09:10.830 --> 09:13.060
- Got any ideas?
- Oh, yeah.

09:13.150 --> 09:15.580
I'd slap some ham on that wall
and have a sandwich.

09:18.909 --> 09:22.530
Uh… you know, the cheese and…

09:22.630 --> 09:28.019
Anyway, the best way to fix a nail hole
would be use joint compound.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.219
Get a putty knife…

09:29.310 --> 09:31.259
I really think spackle
would be a better idea.

09:31.350 --> 09:34.540
- I agree with Mr Vila.
- I'm sure you do, Al.

09:34.630 --> 09:37.419
Clarence, you want to use the spackle
with that putty knife

09:37.509 --> 09:39.380
and very carefully fill in all those little holes.

09:39.469 --> 09:43.380
Then sand them smooth and touch them
up with paint. The walls will be like new.

09:43.469 --> 09:46.780
Well. I believe this round goes to Mr Vila.

09:48.830 --> 09:52.100
- We're not keeping score, Al.
- I am.

09:53.509 --> 09:54.570
Hi, there.

09:54.669 --> 09:56.939
- Hi, this is Chet.
- Hi. Chet.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.739
Tim. I try to catch your show
whenever I can.

09:59.830 --> 10:04.659
- Thank you, Chet, I appreciate that.
- And, Bob, I never miss yours.

10:05.909 --> 10:09.530
- Hey, thanks a lot.
- I'm looking forward to your new book.

10:09.630 --> 10:12.659
Quit the chitchat. Chet,
and let's get with that question.

10:12.749 --> 10:15.979
Well. I was wondering…
I'm remodeling my house.

10:16.070 --> 10:19.979
and I would like to know
what was the name of that wood

10:20.070 --> 10:26.169
that you used on the ceiling of
that old cracker house in Naples, Florida?

10:26.269 --> 10:27.380
What?

10:27.470 --> 10:30.780
The house we had on the show -
yeah, that was pecky cypress.

10:30.869 --> 10:34.900
- Thanks, Bob.
- I believe that's mo points for Mr Vila.

10:35.590 --> 10:40.260
- Well, how am I supposed to know that?
- Perhaps if you watched Mr Vila's show…

10:40.349 --> 10:44.780
This isn't fair. We should get a question
we have an equal chance of answering.

10:44.869 --> 10:48.220
Why… why don't we
go to a female caller?

10:49.030 --> 10:51.220
- Hello?
- Is there a female caller there?

10:51.309 --> 10:53.900
- Timbo, is that you? I got this…
- Is this Tim Taylor?

10:54.309 --> 10:56.610
Do we have a female caller out there?

10:56.709 --> 10:59.499
Randy, have you seen a piece of paper
with a phone number on it?

10:59.590 --> 11:00.650
No. Mom.

11:00.749 --> 11:04.289
Yes. Mother.
I'm having a very nice time.

11:04.389 --> 11:07.099
No, our house is definitely cleaner.

11:08.110 --> 11:11.059
Curtis, have you seen a piece of paper
with a phone number on it?

11:11.150 --> 11:13.860
I threw my gum away in it.

11:16.110 --> 11:19.380
Yes. Mother. She's very nice.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.459
No, much heavier than you.

11:25.470 --> 11:27.459
Mother? Mother?

11:27.550 --> 11:31.329
And to make sure they line up,
it's a good idea to use a dowelling jig.

11:31.430 --> 11:35.260
cos remember, a job worth doing
is a job worth doing right.

11:35.349 --> 11:38.780
Goes without saying,
doesn't it, Bob?

11:38.869 --> 11:42.740
Still waiting for that female caller.
Still waiting for that female caller.

11:42.829 --> 11:45.209
- Hello?
- Hello. What's your name?

11:45.309 --> 11:48.579
This is Jill - ene. Jillene.

11:53.550 --> 11:57.059
Hello, Jill… Jillene.
What's your question?

11:57.150 --> 11:59.860
Well, it's kind of a hard one.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.329
Well, I think one of us
will be able to answer it.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.539
OK.

12:03.630 --> 12:08.340
Can you tell me the name
of a medieval wood-shaping tool?

12:08.430 --> 12:11.939
Ooh, that's hard. Um…

12:12.030 --> 12:14.979
Maybe you'd like
to handle this one, Bob.

12:15.070 --> 12:19.139
I'd love to. I think Jillene's probably
thinking about something called an adze.

12:19.229 --> 12:24.220
Nice try. Bob, but the tool you're…
How the hell did you know that?

12:26.229 --> 12:27.979
Let's get back to our project.

12:28.070 --> 12:33.499
As you recall, last time we were trying
to put a new doorway into an existing wall.

12:33.590 --> 12:35.860
As you can see by our mock-up here.

12:35.950 --> 12:39.300
we've got our jack studs in place.
Now we're gonna put our header in.

12:39.389 --> 12:42.780
So, are you planning on using
a doubled-up mo-by-eight?

12:42.869 --> 12:44.579
No. I'm not. Bob.

12:44.669 --> 12:46.820
I'm thinking about using
that beefy boy over there.

12:46.910 --> 12:49.860
a four-by-eight big piece
of American Doug fir.

12:49.950 --> 12:51.619
Doug fir. Hm. OK.

12:51.709 --> 12:55.139
And, folks, it's a good idea to use your
framing square at this point in the job.

12:55.229 --> 12:57.660
cos you want to make sure this header
goes in there nice and level.

12:57.749 --> 12:58.809
Excellent point, Mr Vila.

12:58.910 --> 13:01.740
Yeah, there's nothing worse than trying
to hang a door in an opening that isn't true.

13:01.829 --> 13:04.579
- How true, how true.
- Al, I was gonna get to that.

13:10.510 --> 13:11.570
Tim?

13:11.669 --> 13:14.459
We'll be right back
after these messages from Binford.

13:14.550 --> 13:16.660
Cut! Cut!

13:17.630 --> 13:20.300
Just what in the world
do you think you're doing?

13:20.389 --> 13:25.410
You've associated the name of
Binford Tools with the killing of Bob Vila!

13:25.510 --> 13:28.260
That's a little harsh, the word "kill", isn't it?
I winged the guy.

13:28.349 --> 13:31.820
I started this company with one wrench
and the sweat of my brow.

13:31.910 --> 13:34.260
I'm not about to flush it
down the crapper now.

13:34.349 --> 13:37.260
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

13:37.349 --> 13:41.220
I've got six daughters
and nobody wants to marry 'em.

13:42.349 --> 13:45.220
Mr Binford, I always thought
Maureen was quite lovely.

13:45.309 --> 13:48.300
Can it. Borland.
Doc, what does it look like?

13:48.389 --> 13:49.740
Well, he seems to be OK.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.289
but I think we should get him
to the emergency room to get checked out.

13:52.389 --> 13:54.139
Good idea.
OK, Bob. Let's go.

13:54.229 --> 13:56.900
Listen, that was just
a little ol' piece of wood that hit you.

13:56.990 --> 13:59.180
I took a grenade during the war.

13:59.269 --> 14:04.180
Yeah, listen. I've got a fine miter box
I want to show you, too. It really cuts the…

14:04.269 --> 14:07.619
Well, Al. I hope you're satisfied.

14:07.709 --> 14:10.419
- Well, what did I do?
- Well, you distracted me.

14:10.510 --> 14:13.139
That's why I whacked him,
Mr Negativity.

14:13.229 --> 14:16.660
I think you did this on purpose because
he beat you at "Stump the Tool Man".

14:16.749 --> 14:19.459
Oh, come on. He didn't beat me.

14:19.550 --> 14:22.340
You even cheated.
You had Jill call in.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.740
That wasn't Jill.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.019
I would never have my wife call in.

14:28.120 --> 14:33.429
Well, you don't have to worry about that
since you'll never be married.

14:35.639 --> 14:38.269
Al, that came out wrong.
I didn't mean it like that.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.389
You'll have a wife one of these days.
If you don't, you'll have a girlfriend.

14:41.480 --> 14:46.110
Somebody who really likes you.
Not just some desperate woman.

14:49.399 --> 14:51.629
Boy, he's so sensitive.

14:53.639 --> 14:55.669
Really? Tomorrow?

14:55.759 --> 14:57.149
Well…

14:57.240 --> 14:59.830
Mr Vila must be a good sport.

14:59.919 --> 15:01.909
OK, yes, sir. I will tell him.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.309
Goodbye.

15:03.399 --> 15:04.509
What's going on?

15:04.600 --> 15:07.159
Bob Vila agreed to be
on the show tomorrow.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.669
Why? Does he want to get hit
in the head again?

15:10.759 --> 15:12.350
No. Curtis.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.350
Don't you think you're cooking
the carrots too long?

15:15.440 --> 15:17.070
No. I don't. Curtis.

15:17.159 --> 15:21.429
- I don't like them when they're soggy.
- They're not going to get soggy. Curtis.

15:21.519 --> 15:25.139
We should have a green vegetable
with those. Zucchini would be nice.

15:25.240 --> 15:29.750
You know what would really be nice.
Curtis? If you would just shut the…

15:31.000 --> 15:33.379
Say it. Mom.

15:36.320 --> 15:39.990
Randy, honey, would you take Curtis
up to your room now? Please?

15:40.080 --> 15:42.350
All right. Let's go. Curtis.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.509
- Oh, hi, honey.
- Hi.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.149
Are you OK?

15:46.240 --> 15:47.669
Yeah.

15:47.759 --> 15:52.269
I just hope I don't hear
the name Bob Vila again.

15:52.360 --> 15:55.549
Well, Mr Binford called.

15:55.639 --> 15:57.629
God. What now?

15:57.720 --> 16:00.710
Somebody has agreed to come back
and be on the show.

16:00.799 --> 16:05.549
I'm not saying who,
but it was someone you hit with a board.

16:05.639 --> 16:06.990
Bob Vila?

16:07.080 --> 16:09.750
Is there somebody else?

16:10.320 --> 16:15.309
No, Jill. I'm cutting back.
I'm just knocking out one guy a week now.

16:17.399 --> 16:22.029
Mr Binford thinks that you should
work things out with Bob… on the air.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.750
Work what out? It was Al's fault.
He distracted me and I hit him.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.399
Don't get snippy with me.
I didn't hit him with a four-by-four.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.750
It was a four-by-eight.

16:29.840 --> 16:33.029
Oh, but you were the one that said.
"He won't know what an adze is."

16:33.120 --> 16:37.629
Now it's my fault? I didn't say,
"Why don't you take the question, Bob?"

16:37.720 --> 16:40.179
I have a rough day.
I come home looking for a little support.

16:40.279 --> 16:44.389
You had a rough day? I got stuck
in this house all day with that little…

16:44.480 --> 16:45.990
Curtis.

16:46.080 --> 16:49.070
Mrs Taylor,
after seeing Randy's room.

16:49.159 --> 16:52.350
I don't think my mom
would want me to eat here.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.470
What a shame.

16:54.559 --> 16:57.830
Well… goodbye.

16:57.919 --> 17:01.350
It's starting to get dark.
Could someone drive me home?

17:05.358 --> 17:08.670
Get your coat.
I better run you home.

17:10.240 --> 17:15.630
If you're gonna drive him home,
make sure there are air holes in the trunk.

17:20.559 --> 17:23.509
- Howdy, Wilson.
- Hi-ho, neighbor.

17:23.598 --> 17:27.108
- What are you cooking?
- Boiling up some willow bark.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.390
It's an old folk remedy
for a headache.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.910
- I got aspirin.
- No.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.549
Tim, it wouldn't be the same.

17:35.640 --> 17:40.269
Mankind may have given me the
headache, but nature will take it away.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.950
- Sure could've used that today.
- Mm? Bad day today?

17:44.039 --> 17:47.109
The worst. I yell at Jill.

17:47.200 --> 17:51.670
I insult Al, and I knocked a guest out
on my show with a four-by-eight.

17:51.759 --> 17:55.539
- Hmm-mm-mm. That is a bad day.
- Well…

17:56.440 --> 17:58.509
Who was your guest, by the way?

17:58.599 --> 18:01.829
You wouldn't know him.
He's the pioneer of home repair.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.589
Oh, you mean Bob Vila!

18:06.880 --> 18:10.109
- You know him?
- Oh, everybody knows Bob.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.190
I can see how a guy like that
might intimidate you, though.

18:12.279 --> 18:13.950
He knows an awful lot about tools.

18:14.039 --> 18:15.910
That's just it.
Why would he intimidate me?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.990
Why does everybody think
he knows more about tools than I do?

18:19.079 --> 18:21.309
Well, does he, Tim?

18:21.400 --> 18:23.390
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.349
He even knew what an adze was
without cheating.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.910
Yes, the old medieval
wood-shaping tool.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.150
- How am I supposed to top that?
- Oh, you can't, Tim.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.950
OK, so I go back on my show
and look like a fool again.

18:39.039 --> 18:43.390
Tim, Tim, Tim. The first step
for greatness is humbling yourself.

18:46.920 --> 18:51.430
Maybe you shouldn't try to have all the
answers, and instead ask more questions.

18:51.519 --> 18:57.029
You see, Tim, a truly wise man
always has more questions than answers.

18:57.839 --> 19:01.619
So… would that make me
wiser than you, Wilson?

19:02.480 --> 19:05.390
Well, what do you think, Tim?

19:25.960 --> 19:30.470
Well, we've finished putting in that door.
And something is still missing.

19:30.559 --> 19:33.910
The light switch to our beautiful chandelier.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.779
But before we install the light switch.
I'd like to point out another bright spot.

19:37.880 --> 19:41.549
my assistant, Al,
who is a very special guy.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.269
Well, thank you, Tim.

19:43.359 --> 19:46.269
And I'd also like to mention to you ladies
that he's single and very available.

19:46.359 --> 19:49.269
Uh, Tim, are we ready
for our special guest?

19:49.359 --> 19:51.390
Oh, right you are, Al.

19:51.480 --> 19:57.470
Let's welcome back to the show
a fully repaired and healed-up Mr Bob Vila.

20:07.319 --> 20:11.789
- It's not like I'm gonna hit ya.
- I'll just hang back here with Al, all right?

20:11.880 --> 20:16.710
fine, fine. Cos I'm a humble enough guy
to admit when I've made a mistake.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.230
And we had a bad accident
on the show last time.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.990
and I want to say
that I take full blame for that.

20:23.079 --> 20:26.700
Tim. I accept your apology.
Can I go now?

20:26.799 --> 20:29.359
Well. I was hoping you'd help us
put in the wall switch.

20:29.440 --> 20:33.109
Well, you're the expert, Tim.
You really should install the switch.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.430
Well. I have to be humble enough to say

20:35.519 --> 20:38.549
that I really don't know
all there is to know about home repair.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.670
Well, Tim, you surprise me.

20:40.759 --> 20:44.630
Oh, come on, Al. This is Bob Vila,
the big kahuna of home repair.

20:44.720 --> 20:50.869
I think the audience would like to see him
in action. What do you think? Come on.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.109
Well, what the heck.

20:55.200 --> 20:59.029
I mean, electrical work is not my strong
point, Tim, but this is pretty simple stuff.

20:59.119 --> 21:01.549
I assume you've knocked out the hole
and fed the wires through there.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.750
- That would be these three here.
- And then the very important thing

21:03.839 --> 21:07.829
is to make sure they're clamped down
securely with a lock nut connector.

21:07.920 --> 21:13.390
I was in Scotland this year,
and I actually saw the lock nut connector.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.109
Connect away, Bob.

21:20.200 --> 21:24.750
Tim, are you sure
you turned off the electricity?

21:24.839 --> 21:26.470
That goes without saying, Al.

21:26.559 --> 21:29.150
Well, now that we've said it,
have you done it?

21:29.240 --> 21:31.910
Tim, it's your show.
I think you should install the switch.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.380
Oh, you're the guest.
Go on, go on.

21:35.039 --> 21:37.869
Al, would you do this? Please.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.549
I don't think so, Bob.

21:42.519 --> 21:44.309
Oh, come on, you guys.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.470
- What the heck. I'll put it in.
- Go for it.

21:46.559 --> 21:49.150
It's a simple socket switch.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.349
Wiring is very simple.
I just thought Bob'd like to take a shot at it.

21:52.440 --> 21:56.869
Wiring is very simple with these…
I got a little… There. OK.

21:56.960 --> 22:00.740
Now, green, of course,
like the ground, is green.

22:00.839 --> 22:03.470
White is hot and… No, white…

22:03.559 --> 22:05.990
Well, hot…
What is this one here?

22:23.480 --> 22:26.150
- Curtis is coming!
- Oh, no.

22:26.240 --> 22:29.509
- Curtis is coming!
- Brad, get the lights. Everybody hide.

22:31.599 --> 22:34.160
Don't make a sound.

22:37.519 --> 22:40.029
Is anybody home?

22:40.119 --> 22:42.029
Hello!

22:44.960 --> 22:47.750
I saw your lights on!

22:49.880 --> 22:52.440
My mom said I could stay overnight!

22:54.359 --> 22:57.150
But you have to let me in first!

22:58.960 --> 23:01.710
I know you're in there!

23:01.799 --> 23:03.789
Hello!

23:20.079 --> 23:21.990
He's fakin' it.
