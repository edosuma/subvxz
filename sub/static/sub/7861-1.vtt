01:52.386 --> 01:54.889
Does your daddy have a job?

02:01.528 --> 02:03.498
I never met the man.

02:05.766 --> 02:09.404
[man] Well now who's the man that
shares that residence with you?

02:11.405 --> 02:14.974
That's my mom's boyfriend.

02:15.008 --> 02:17.811
[man] Well, is he gainfully employed?

02:17.845 --> 02:23.484
Yeah, he rents porta potties.

02:35.728 --> 02:37.464
You know, for the pickers.

02:38.798 --> 02:41.535
[man] OK, for the Mexicans.

02:42.435 --> 02:44.537
They're Guatemalans now,

02:44.571 --> 02:46.574
at least that's what I've been told.

02:49.510 --> 02:50.543
[man] Have you talked to your daddy,

02:50.577 --> 02:52.714
your step-daddy about a job?

02:53.746 --> 02:55.048
No.

02:55.082 --> 02:57.283
[man] Well, maybe those shit house renters

02:57.317 --> 02:59.353
could use a hand for the summer.

03:01.554 --> 03:02.990
Maybe.

[man on TV] <i>...frontiers

03:29.750 --> 03:32.452
- You hear that!
- [man] Don't slam my door.

03:32.486 --> 03:34.454
I'll slam whatever I want to!

03:34.488 --> 03:35.523
[door opens]

03:36.957 --> 03:38.758
I can't believe you said
that to me in public.

03:38.792 --> 03:40.659
I apologized.

03:40.693 --> 03:42.528
You said don't worry about it.

03:42.562 --> 03:43.996
[man] Yeah, you worry too much.

03:44.030 --> 03:45.799
[woman] You're such an asshole.

03:45.833 --> 03:48.634
[man] Now you gonna apologize to me?

03:48.668 --> 03:50.004
Huh?

[car approaching]

04:56.603 --> 04:57.772
Hey.

04:58.938 --> 05:00.540
I called you.

05:02.642 --> 05:03.877
So?

05:05.077 --> 05:07.914
Well, I'm here now.

05:13.853 --> 05:15.723
Is that your dad's truck?

05:18.892 --> 05:20.661
Sorry.

05:21.695 --> 05:23.762
Can you get the keys for it?

05:23.796 --> 05:25.565
[scoffs]

05:28.668 --> 05:30.002
What for?

05:30.036 --> 05:33.740
Well, some people are saying
they're going to Mexico.

05:34.707 --> 05:36.543
I don't know, could be fun.

05:36.577 --> 05:38.011
Why don't we take your car?

05:38.045 --> 05:39.711
My car is a piece.

05:39.745 --> 05:41.514
It'd break down half way there.

05:41.548 --> 05:44.750
Yeah, your car does suck.

05:44.784 --> 05:49.589
Alright, hang out here in
your underwear and boots.

05:49.623 --> 05:50.956
[laughs]

05:50.990 --> 05:52.791
I'll be down with the senoritas,

05:52.825 --> 05:54.895
drinking margaritas.

06:15.949 --> 06:17.585
Is that it?

06:40.707 --> 06:42.641
They just let you drive across?

06:42.675 --> 06:44.677
Mm-hmm.

06:44.711 --> 06:46.846
I guess if you were coming
back is the important part,

06:46.880 --> 06:52.053
cause no one ever smuggled
their ass into Mexico.

06:59.226 --> 07:02.697
[Mexican music plays]

07:05.132 --> 07:07.001
Four dollars.

07:19.312 --> 07:20.812

07:24.918 --> 07:27.021
- Fifty.
- Fifty.

07:28.221 --> 07:30.757
What's the one on the ends name?

07:30.791 --> 07:33.826
- Rosalinda.
- Rosalinda.

07:33.860 --> 07:37.565
- What about that one?
- Rosalinda.

07:38.832 --> 07:40.699
How many Rosalinda's you got?

07:40.733 --> 07:42.736
As many as you want.

08:22.209 --> 08:24.776
Do you have money for your friend?

08:24.810 --> 08:26.245
What?

08:26.279 --> 08:29.014
You have money for your friend?

08:29.048 --> 08:30.716
Why?

08:30.750 --> 08:33.719
[man] Everybody thinks
he can not pay for her.

08:33.753 --> 08:36.289
If you're his friend, you pay.

08:38.224 --> 08:39.758
Or what?

08:39.792 --> 08:41.660
I beat his shit.

08:43.296 --> 08:47.099
Well, that sounds like
it's between you and him.

08:47.133 --> 08:48.935
You're friend's not here.

08:50.771 --> 08:52.771
Where the fuck is he?

08:52.805 --> 08:54.073
He fucked my wife,

08:54.107 --> 08:56.944
went out the window and
took a taxi to America.

08:58.811 --> 09:01.747
Well, that sounds like
you're shit out of luck.

09:01.781 --> 09:04.850
Well, fucking is not for free.

09:04.884 --> 09:07.787
How much does it cost to fuck your wife?

09:08.354 --> 09:11.257
Two-hundred dollars.

09:11.291 --> 09:14.161
Pancho over there says
the going rate is 50.

09:15.362 --> 09:16.998
Your friend hit her face.

09:17.763 --> 09:19.132
No, he didn't.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.167
[man] She has bruises.

09:29.843 --> 09:32.713
The way she's looking
at you, you hit her face.

09:37.783 --> 09:40.053
Never mind about your friend then.

09:42.855 --> 09:44.257
You fuck my wife then.

09:44.291 --> 09:45.824
Now I'm fucking your wife?

09:45.858 --> 09:47.292
That's what I'm gonna tell the police.

09:47.326 --> 09:51.130
You fucked my wife, then
you hit her face, my wife.

09:51.164 --> 09:52.765
The fuck she's your wife.

09:52.799 --> 09:56.268
Listen to me my friend,
you're a long ways from home.

09:56.302 --> 09:58.871
My cousin, he's the police.

09:58.905 --> 10:02.340
My uncle is the captain of the jail.

10:02.374 --> 10:05.177
It is very simple for you to go to jail.

10:05.211 --> 10:10.016
Two-hundred dollars and,
you can go back home.

10:11.218 --> 10:12.318
That's just about the sorriest

10:12.352 --> 10:14.820
Mexican shakedown I've ever heard.

10:14.854 --> 10:18.959
Two-hundred dollars.

10:25.998 --> 10:27.868
[grunts]

10:30.970 --> 10:32.205
Fuck.

10:36.209 --> 10:38.378
I saw you in there.

10:43.416 --> 10:45.252
Sorry I didn't help.

10:51.123 --> 10:52.826
Can I buy you breakfast?

10:54.960 --> 10:56.397
What for?

10:57.229 --> 10:59.399
Well, aren't you hungry?

11:04.003 --> 11:05.973
So are you looking for work?

11:06.940 --> 11:08.374
Nope.

11:09.441 --> 11:11.044
You look like you are.

11:12.244 --> 11:13.945
So?

11:13.979 --> 11:16.983
Well, I got something you
might be interested in.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.020
What is it?

11:21.021 --> 11:22.957
You wanna be a rich son of a bitch?

11:23.924 --> 11:25.392
Maybe.

11:26.892 --> 11:29.028
Stay right here.

12:15.307 --> 12:16.876
Mitch, this is the Captain.

12:17.877 --> 12:19.512
Mitch is from Texas.

12:19.546 --> 12:21.382
Is that so?

12:22.616 --> 12:25.052
Yeah he's got a bad ass black SUV.

12:26.485 --> 12:27.920
No shit.

12:27.954 --> 12:29.989
What do you need me for Mitch?

12:31.458 --> 12:32.925
I never said that I did.

12:32.959 --> 12:34.895
[laughs]

12:36.528 --> 12:39.399
Well, it's like this.

12:41.033 --> 12:42.968
You know Halliburton right?

12:43.002 --> 12:44.872
Yeah.

12:46.238 --> 12:48.174
You do?

12:48.208 --> 12:49.577
No.

12:52.012 --> 12:53.945
It's a company.

12:53.979 --> 12:55.982
- OK.
- They're in Iraq.

12:56.016 --> 12:59.017
They've got private security
working for the government.

12:59.051 --> 13:03.055
A Halliburton truck driver makes five times

13:03.089 --> 13:05.491
what a four star general makes.

13:05.525 --> 13:07.394
You know why?

13:08.994 --> 13:11.030
I guess cause it's a rip off.

13:12.599 --> 13:15.603
Cause they get the fucking job done.

13:17.036 --> 13:19.338
And when you get the fucking job done,

13:19.372 --> 13:22.108
you get to name your price.

13:24.344 --> 13:27.046
Do you wanna name your price, Mitch?

13:28.949 --> 13:30.984
Hell yeah, he does.

13:35.155 --> 13:39.425
Look, Jesse's a dip shit.

13:39.459 --> 13:41.393
Anybody can see that.

13:41.427 --> 13:44.898
He likes to talk a good game but you,

13:46.232 --> 13:48.102
you don't like to talk.

13:50.103 --> 13:53.071
So I'm not gonna say shit to you.

13:53.105 --> 13:54.507
I'm not gonna tell you how you could be

13:54.541 --> 13:56.175
a freedom fighter on the front lines,

13:56.209 --> 13:57.343
on the war on drugs,

13:57.377 --> 13:59.111
saving I don't know how many sisters

13:59.145 --> 14:01.046
from a life of prostitution and whoring,

14:01.080 --> 14:03.249
just to get their next fix.

14:05.118 --> 14:06.718
I'm not gonna tell you,

14:06.752 --> 14:09.188
you could make big money carrying a gun

14:09.222 --> 14:11.556
and wearing a badge and getting sweet look

14:11.590 --> 14:13.725
from every senorita that walks by.

14:13.759 --> 14:15.460
And I'm not gonna tell you

14:15.494 --> 14:17.964
that it feels like a
shot of mainline heroine

14:17.998 --> 14:20.098
to be kicking ass and taking names,

14:20.132 --> 14:22.068
all in the name of Uncle Sam,

14:22.102 --> 14:25.170
all the while knowing that
you've got diplomatic immunity

14:25.204 --> 14:27.305
under section 434.868C,

14:27.339 --> 14:29.709
passed by the U.S. Senate last year.

14:29.743 --> 14:32.146
What I am gonna tell you...

14:33.579 --> 14:35.416
...is I'll pay you,

14:36.583 --> 14:40.018
5,000 dollars a week to ride by my side.

14:40.052 --> 14:42.188
What do you say cowboy?

14:46.759 --> 14:48.528
I don't know.

14:58.637 --> 15:05.244
Look... I know you've got a
crap ass situation to go back to.

15:07.046 --> 15:08.613
We all do.

15:08.647 --> 15:10.782
Nobody spends one night in Mexico

15:10.816 --> 15:14.020
if they've got anything
to go back to up there.

15:15.488 --> 15:17.323
But you know deep in your gut,

15:17.357 --> 15:19.525
that whatever might happen down here,

15:19.559 --> 15:22.460
can't be half as bad as
that crap ass situation

15:22.494 --> 15:24.998
you have to go back to.

15:33.672 --> 15:35.375
So why go back?

15:59.364 --> 16:00.600
[sighs]

16:06.272 --> 16:08.575
It'll be easier if I drive.

16:49.482 --> 16:51.318
[car door closing]

17:00.593 --> 17:02.161
Come on.

17:41.801 --> 17:43.337
Take your pick.

18:42.362 --> 18:45.599
[thunder rumbles]

18:47.432 --> 18:48.701
[man] Attention!

18:48.735 --> 18:50.802
Wake up, girls.

18:50.836 --> 18:52.405
Come on!

18:52.771 --> 18:54.373
Line up!

18:55.374 --> 18:56.776
Come on!

19:03.783 --> 19:05.319
Come on!

19:09.921 --> 19:12.358
Four mile, double time hike.

19:12.392 --> 19:16.861
I don't want any talking,
belly aching, or grab ass.

19:16.895 --> 19:19.564
I'll see you in the mess.

19:19.598 --> 19:22.635
Camarillo, get Mitch an outfit.

19:43.655 --> 19:46.425
No one goes in the big house.

19:47.826 --> 19:49.429
OK.

20:15.087 --> 20:16.387
What's this for?

20:16.421 --> 20:19.457
That's your weapon.

20:19.491 --> 20:21.592
Am I supposed to hit somebody with it?

20:21.626 --> 20:24.429
It's your rifle.

20:24.463 --> 20:26.598
Am I supposed to shoot somebody with it?

20:26.632 --> 20:30.036
You will get a real weapon
whenever you earned it.

21:24.824 --> 21:26.692
[hawk screeches]

21:47.078 --> 21:49.615
So, how'd you get here?

21:50.450 --> 21:52.084
Just came down.

21:54.953 --> 21:58.756
Aren't you gonna ask how I got here?

21:58.790 --> 22:01.460
- You want me to?
- Yeah.

22:01.494 --> 22:02.927
How'd you get down here?

22:02.961 --> 22:06.531
My daddy stole me out of
Oklahoma, away from my mama,

22:06.565 --> 22:07.899
who had no right to me.

22:07.933 --> 22:09.568
They say I'm on a milk carton,

22:09.602 --> 22:11.571
but I don't believe them.

22:12.771 --> 22:13.839
Your daddy?

22:13.873 --> 22:15.573
The Captain's my daddy.

22:15.607 --> 22:16.875
Stole me away.

22:16.909 --> 22:20.147
Say he'd waited a year,
then couldn't wait no more.

22:22.681 --> 22:24.015
That's quite a story you got there.

22:24.049 --> 22:26.752
That's why I made you ask me.

22:27.753 --> 22:31.557
[whistles] Break.

22:31.591 --> 22:33.559
[Mitch] So how long you all been at this?

22:33.593 --> 22:34.760
Forever.

22:34.794 --> 22:36.561
Where's it going?

22:36.595 --> 22:40.901
Around the tree, all the way to the corral.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.601
What's it for?

22:43.635 --> 22:45.638
Protection.

22:46.771 --> 22:49.041
Protection against what?

22:49.075 --> 22:51.111
[man] It builds character.

23:05.525 --> 23:06.593
[yells]

23:21.940 --> 23:23.876
OK, back to work.

23:25.678 --> 23:26.979
Back!

23:29.649 --> 23:31.517
You can't mean him right?

23:31.551 --> 23:33.220
Everyone!

23:40.992 --> 23:42.661
Stop.

23:43.763 --> 23:44.865
Stop.

23:49.334 --> 23:52.704
Hey, we can pick up the pace.

23:52.738 --> 23:55.607
We're not gonna miss one saw.

23:55.641 --> 23:57.710
We have orders.

24:00.011 --> 24:02.580
You ever been bit by a scorpion?

24:02.614 --> 24:07.685
There's a lot of things
worse in war than scorpions.

24:07.719 --> 24:08.520
This isn't fucking war.

24:08.554 --> 24:11.157
We're just digging a fucking ditch!

24:12.924 --> 24:14.728
Paul!

24:19.931 --> 24:21.966
Sir.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.304
If this soldier talks back
to me again, you silence him.

24:26.338 --> 24:28.740
Paul, you touch me and
you'll see what happens.

24:28.774 --> 24:32.677
Money says it's on, it's on.

24:32.711 --> 24:34.879
Benito, go back to cutting.

24:34.913 --> 24:36.848
Don't move.

24:36.882 --> 24:39.619
Discipline the soldier.

24:40.686 --> 24:42.220
Don't do it, Paul.

24:42.254 --> 24:43.688
Now!

24:43.722 --> 24:45.724

[Mitch] Jack.

25:40.312 --> 25:41.848
Jack.

25:43.783 --> 25:44.950
I can see you.

25:44.984 --> 25:46.984
No you can't.

25:47.018 --> 25:48.819
Come on Jack, let me out.

25:48.853 --> 25:50.657
[Jack] You know I can't.

25:52.357 --> 25:55.928
- Is it piss or water?
- Water.

25:57.830 --> 26:00.934
- Are you lying?
- Smell it yourself.

26:11.043 --> 26:13.046
Do you have any food?

26:15.881 --> 26:19.886
[wolves howling]

27:09.401 --> 27:11.470

27:11.504 --> 27:13.039
[Benito] Mitch.

27:14.940 --> 27:16.841
Yeah.

27:16.875 --> 27:18.811
[Benito] Thank you.

28:31.616 --> 28:36.021
[banging]

29:34.646 --> 29:36.181
Attention!

29:50.395 --> 29:52.030
God bless, let's eat.

30:38.544 --> 30:39.912
Mitch.

30:44.083 --> 30:46.451
[door opens]

30:50.255 --> 30:52.558
I want my money, I'm going home.

31:01.033 --> 31:03.635
Mitch, I can't keep building fences,

31:03.669 --> 31:06.104
knowing they ain't gonna hold.

31:08.007 --> 31:09.974
That's not 5,000 dollars.

31:10.008 --> 31:13.444
You're lucky you're still breathing.

31:13.478 --> 31:16.149
I want what was promised to me.

31:17.649 --> 31:20.219
You want to be great?

31:21.319 --> 31:23.120
You are great.

31:23.154 --> 31:25.656
It's itching inside of you,
just waiting to get out,

31:25.690 --> 31:27.258
but there's no way to prove it.

31:27.292 --> 31:29.127
There's no playing field.

31:29.161 --> 31:33.031
You go back up to the
States now... [scoffs]

31:33.065 --> 31:35.733
...no one will ever know it.

31:35.767 --> 31:36.768
But here...

31:39.371 --> 31:43.742
When you look out on the
desert, what do you see?

31:43.776 --> 31:45.609
You see sand.

31:45.643 --> 31:48.213
I see shimmering horizons.

31:48.247 --> 31:52.250
I see silver and gold that flow like water.

31:52.284 --> 31:57.454
You see a mirage, I see mercury plains.

31:57.488 --> 32:01.025
I see women, I see music.

32:01.059 --> 32:06.164
I see love, and I see a whole lot of money.

32:06.198 --> 32:07.698
There's no money down here.

32:07.732 --> 32:10.100
Oh, that's where you're wrong son.

32:10.134 --> 32:11.502
There's more money down here

32:11.536 --> 32:14.138
than all the banks in Texas combined,

32:14.172 --> 32:17.009
you can thank the cartels for that.

32:17.742 --> 32:19.543
What's in it for me?

32:19.577 --> 32:23.181
The only way to find out,
is to measure yourself

32:23.215 --> 32:25.752
against the mercury plains.

32:31.489 --> 32:35.326
Whatever we confiscate, you keep half.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.095
But I need you here.

32:37.129 --> 32:40.299
Boys are starting to look up
to you, they need a leader.

32:41.767 --> 32:43.402
Half.

32:49.575 --> 32:52.778
[sawing]

33:28.913 --> 33:31.150
Mitch Davis.

33:41.826 --> 33:44.296
Paul Whitesall.

33:45.730 --> 33:47.666
Pleased to meet you.

33:54.238 --> 33:56.508
I'm here to kick ass.

33:57.609 --> 34:00.712
Who's ass, I don't care.

34:00.746 --> 34:05.750
As long as it's spic,
Injun, or white trash.

34:05.784 --> 34:07.886
Which is pretty much a damn near certainty,

34:07.920 --> 34:10.588
considering this line of work.

34:10.621 --> 34:12.692
Wouldn't you say?

34:16.428 --> 34:18.697
That's a pretty gun Paul.

34:34.413 --> 34:35.715
Thank you.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.351
There's suddenly a time in any mans life

34:42.386 --> 34:47.456
where he can look back
and see a turning point.

34:47.491 --> 34:52.797
But for a soldier, every
moment is a turning point.

35:01.806 --> 35:03.743
Who wants it?

35:12.817 --> 35:15.352
Paul the apostle.

35:15.386 --> 35:17.854
There's a drug runner
working out of Monclova.

35:17.888 --> 35:19.323
It's a smaller town,

35:19.357 --> 35:22.327
and he's keeping a low
profile for a white man.

35:22.361 --> 35:25.363
But last week, a little girl turned up dead

35:25.397 --> 35:28.499
in Houston, on some bad meth,
his operation sold to her.

35:28.533 --> 35:30.501
I got a newspaper article
with a picture on it

35:30.535 --> 35:33.437
if you wanna let that little girl's face

35:33.471 --> 35:35.506
burn into your brain a little bit.

35:35.540 --> 35:37.542
But you shouldn't need the motivation.

35:37.576 --> 35:41.745
This guy is wrong, and you are right.

35:41.779 --> 35:44.716
But he's smart, and he's well protected.

35:44.750 --> 35:47.719
So we're gonna need to
use a little diversion.

35:55.926 --> 35:58.463
Look at that bastard.

35:58.497 --> 36:00.397
[speaks Spanish] ...shirt.

36:00.431 --> 36:02.334
Beautiful fucking shirt.

36:03.535 --> 36:04.904
Yo, guys.

36:20.319 --> 36:23.454
- Sir, you need taxi?
- No.

36:23.488 --> 36:25.423
You're going to the airport,
yes? You need a taxi.

36:25.457 --> 36:26.591
I sent for a car thanks.

36:26.625 --> 36:27.758
They're not here.

36:27.792 --> 36:29.760
Taxi's better and less money.

36:29.794 --> 36:32.729
Yeah, you know what, I'm gonna
give him another minute OK.

36:32.763 --> 36:33.765
Come to my brothers taxi.

36:33.799 --> 36:35.899
No, you know what, no alright.

36:35.933 --> 36:37.568
It'll be here.

36:37.602 --> 36:41.638
OK, don't, we'll see.

36:41.672 --> 36:43.374
You're gonna be late.

36:43.408 --> 36:45.511
Kid, what are you doing?

36:46.611 --> 36:47.644

36:47.678 --> 36:50.015

37:06.397 --> 37:07.700
[Paul] Get out!

37:10.468 --> 37:12.736
I'll light you up! Get out!

37:12.770 --> 37:15.506
Get out!

37:15.540 --> 37:18.411
On your knees, on your fucking knees!

37:20.511 --> 37:21.881
OK.

37:25.817 --> 37:28.519
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck is pin number?

37:28.553 --> 37:29.586
Come on!

37:29.620 --> 37:31.655
It's... it's a credit card,

37:31.689 --> 37:33.091
it doesn't have a pin number.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.459
Where are the drugs?

37:34.493 --> 37:36.594
The blue one, the blue one has the number.

37:37.796 --> 37:39.497
What's the pin number?

37:39.531 --> 37:41.566
- One, one, four, four.
- What?

37:41.600 --> 37:43.934
- One, one, four, four.
- Where are the drugs?

37:43.968 --> 37:46.704
- They're not here.
- Alright, let's go guys.

37:46.738 --> 37:47.939
Let's go!

37:47.973 --> 37:50.441
Get the fuck, get out of the way.

37:50.475 --> 37:51.843
[Benito] Where are they!

37:51.877 --> 37:54.644
Paul, Paul!

38:04.723 --> 38:07.593
Paul! Let's go!

38:10.661 --> 38:11.896
We gotta put him in the taxi.

38:11.930 --> 38:13.564
We gotta... We gotta take him to get help.

38:13.598 --> 38:15.433
Let's go!

38:16.167 --> 38:18.603
Paul, put him in the cab.

38:19.703 --> 38:21.841
Paul, put him in the taxi, come on!

38:24.109 --> 38:26.042
[Camarillo] Let's go!

38:44.629 --> 38:46.565
We gotta go.

[Boy] Ow!

40:26.765 --> 40:27.832
Mitch.

40:27.866 --> 40:30.536
- Yeah.
- Do you know how to read?

40:31.870 --> 40:33.137
Why?

40:33.171 --> 40:35.673
I found the letter, in the shirt.

40:35.707 --> 40:36.874
Maybe from the girlfriend.

40:36.908 --> 40:39.644
No, no, I don't know how to read.

40:39.678 --> 40:40.980
[can pops open]

40:41.812 --> 40:43.848
Yes, you do.

40:52.723 --> 40:54.591
It's not from his girlfriend.

40:54.625 --> 40:56.761
What's the problem?

40:57.728 --> 40:59.163
[speaks Spanish]

41:00.665 --> 41:01.933
Come on.

41:03.768 --> 41:05.103

"Dear Brad, I'm writing
early in the morning,

41:17.848 --> 41:19.783
before anyone else is up.

41:19.817 --> 41:22.218
Things are clear in
the morning aren't they?

41:22.252 --> 41:24.155
I've been planting a new
garden behind the shed.

41:24.189 --> 41:26.323
Sometimes I think
planting is the best part.

41:26.357 --> 41:28.693
And if so, why plant the garden at all?

41:28.727 --> 41:30.595
I guess that's life.

41:30.629 --> 41:32.662
I hope everything is going
well for you down in Mexico."

41:32.696 --> 41:34.265
What is it?

41:35.767 --> 41:37.236
Shut up!

night at the dinner table.

She always says for Jesus to guide you,

41:53.817 --> 41:55.653
and keep you from harm.

41:55.687 --> 41:57.888
Just those words every time."

[boy] Aye yai, yai, yai!

41:59.957 --> 42:02.359
Hey, everybody would you shut the fuck up!

42:02.393 --> 42:04.062
We've got a letter in here.

42:09.868 --> 42:13.803
"We all wish that Jesus
would guide you back home.

42:13.837 --> 42:16.207
I understand your reasons
for staying so long.

42:16.241 --> 42:17.774
You say you love the country

42:17.808 --> 42:20.077
and that it's good for your career.

42:20.111 --> 42:22.680
But I can't help but think
that your fight with your father

42:22.714 --> 42:24.814
has clouded your thinking.

42:24.848 --> 42:26.117
I talked to him and he said

42:26.151 --> 42:28.919
that he's sorry about what happened

42:28.953 --> 42:33.323
and he would say as much to you.

42:33.357 --> 42:36.160
And you know how hard-headed he is.

42:36.194 --> 42:39.765
If staying in Mexico is
what you truly think is best,

42:40.864 --> 42:43.334
we will understand.

42:43.368 --> 42:45.435
But we miss you.

42:45.469 --> 42:47.671
We want you here

42:47.705 --> 42:50.808
and we will welcome you back
if you'd want to come home.

We're from out of town.

Nobody knows us.

We're rich, we got a car.

45:29.634 --> 45:31.100
We got bodyguards.

45:31.134 --> 45:33.838
We're looking to make a big purchase.

45:33.872 --> 45:35.138
We act like dip shits,

45:35.172 --> 45:38.242
we offer too much money,
too much to refuse.

45:38.276 --> 45:40.144
Now they don't trust us,

45:40.178 --> 45:42.613
but they want the money,
cause they're greedy bastards.

45:42.647 --> 45:46.015
Let them set the time,
let them set the place.

It means they're be more
off guard, when we hit them.

You're a quiet motherfucker.

01:03:19.703 --> 01:03:21.939
That means you think too much.

I like that.

01:03:24.573 --> 01:03:27.142

01:03:27.176 --> 01:03:31.214
It's a bad thing for
musicians lovers, and soldiers.

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:35.286
Stop thinking so much.

01:03:36.453 --> 01:03:38.055

If you say so.

01:03:51.468 --> 01:03:54.071

- War.
- And what is war?

01:03:58.741 --> 01:04:02.512
I mean take out the killing
part. What's its purpose?

01:04:02.546 --> 01:04:06.249
To take and keep territory.
And what is territory?

01:04:06.283 --> 01:04:10.388
If you think about it, I own this,
you don't, get off my property.

01:04:11.721 --> 01:04:14.390
It's the foundation
for the power structure.

01:04:14.424 --> 01:04:17.993
Armies are all about keeping
power structure in place.

01:04:18.027 --> 01:04:20.562
Keeping the rich folks rich,
and the poor folks poor.

01:04:20.596 --> 01:04:23.968
And the places where
there's no power structure...

01:04:25.468 --> 01:04:28.104
...those armies are worthless.

01:04:28.138 --> 01:04:31.374
But out here in the third world,

01:04:31.408 --> 01:04:33.977
the power structure is all fucked up.

01:04:34.011 --> 01:04:37.046
They've got hospitals
for shit, police for shit,

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.450
but they also don't have the man,

01:04:40.484 --> 01:04:42.584
locking you in place.

01:04:42.618 --> 01:04:46.321
Down here, any one man can be
as powerful as any one other man

01:04:46.355 --> 01:04:50.193
at any point in time.
That's the beauty of it.

01:04:50.227 --> 01:04:54.564
It means, if I'm sharp up
here, and if I've got guts,

01:04:54.598 --> 01:04:57.168
I can own the whole world.

01:05:01.471 --> 01:05:06.075
Back in America, I'd probably
just be another fucked up vet,

01:05:09.779 --> 01:05:12.515

01:05:14.618 --> 01:05:16.352
Unlucky.

01:05:16.386 --> 01:05:20.323

01:05:20.357 --> 01:05:21.490

on the way to the castle.

Now I gotta protect my power structure.

01:05:36.172 --> 01:05:40.075
I didn't see it coming but here I am.

01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:43.013
That's why I need soldiers like you.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.714

[footsteps]

01:12:46.603 --> 01:12:50.073
[indistinct chatter]

01:13:03.819 --> 01:13:07.590
[wolves howling]

01:13:43.292 --> 01:13:45.795
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:14:09.751 --> 01:14:13.156
[gunshots]

01:14:17.693 --> 01:14:20.229
[gunshots]

01:14:31.773 --> 01:14:33.042
Drive!

01:14:38.915 --> 01:14:40.783
[speaking Spanish]

01:15:05.808 --> 01:15:07.578
Shit.

01:15:11.747 --> 01:15:13.716
Come on, come on.

01:15:15.283 --> 01:15:17.052
[the Captain] Go to the ditch.

01:15:17.086 --> 01:15:18.855
Go that way.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:24.827
[the Captain] Come on,
Mitch, he's gaining on us.

01:15:24.861 --> 01:15:27.598
- I don't see it.
- [Camarillo] That way, that way.

01:15:27.996 --> 01:15:31.667
[sirens blaring]

01:15:32.801 --> 01:15:34.136
[the Captain] Right turn, right.

01:15:34.871 --> 01:15:36.672
There he is.

01:15:40.943 --> 01:15:42.813
Turn right at the tree.

01:16:01.029 --> 01:16:02.163
[Mitch] What are we doing here?

01:16:02.197 --> 01:16:04.634
[the Captain] Waiting on a paper.

01:16:05.734 --> 01:16:06.735
For what?

01:16:06.769 --> 01:16:09.139
Find out who took that move.

01:16:11.206 --> 01:16:15.244
You steal from federal police,
they're bound to find us.

01:16:15.278 --> 01:16:17.280
Yeah, but not that fast.

01:16:22.385 --> 01:16:25.822
Maybe you did it. Did you do it?

01:16:27.857 --> 01:16:31.294
Nah, that's not your style.

01:16:35.864 --> 01:16:37.867
What have we got?

01:16:39.836 --> 01:16:42.906
[speaking in Spanish]

01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:49.311
...gang, operating from a farmhouse.

01:16:50.846 --> 01:16:54.483
May have been connected
to other acts of violence.

01:16:54.517 --> 01:17:00.154
Jesse... of Macon, Georgia,
found dead in Monterrey.

01:17:00.188 --> 01:17:05.894
Paul Whitesall, of Houston, shot
dead in Juarez, by federal agents.

01:17:05.928 --> 01:17:07.863
[speaking Spanish]

01:17:07.897 --> 01:17:12.367
Captured at the scene was
Ruben Gustavo Hernandez, 13.

01:17:12.401 --> 01:17:15.471
Material witness, Alyssa Booker, 19,

01:17:15.505 --> 01:17:20.208
of San Antonio, Texas,
was taken into custody.

01:17:20.242 --> 01:17:26.716
Jack Barnes 14, thought to be the
son of Barry Barnes, the leader...

01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:29.886
...was killed in the shootout.

01:17:44.367 --> 01:17:46.069
Benito.

01:17:49.138 --> 01:17:51.207
He's not listed there.

01:17:53.075 --> 01:17:55.444
Oh, Benito.

01:18:04.586 --> 01:18:06.288
How you doing, son?

01:18:07.255 --> 01:18:09.190
I made it out alive.

01:18:09.224 --> 01:18:10.861
Glad you did, too.

01:18:39.087 --> 01:18:41.524
Let's go for a little walk, Benito.

01:18:42.425 --> 01:18:45.293
[Benito] What for?

01:18:45.327 --> 01:18:47.096
[the Captain] Just want
to have a little talk.

01:18:48.331 --> 01:18:50.801
No, no, that's OK.

01:18:52.535 --> 01:18:54.869
- Come on, let's go.
- No.

01:18:54.903 --> 01:18:57.206
- Get out...
- [Benito mumbling]

01:19:19.028 --> 01:19:20.397
Sometimes...

01:19:22.998 --> 01:19:27.970
Sometimes, a great man have to do...

01:19:29.237 --> 01:19:31.173
...terrible things.

01:19:33.142 --> 01:19:34.911
[choking]

01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:56.166
[gunshot]

01:20:01.103 --> 01:20:02.572
[gunshot]

01:20:07.042 --> 01:20:08.510
[gunshot]

01:20:14.517 --> 01:20:16.086
[gunshot]

01:20:19.554 --> 01:20:21.056
[gunshot]

01:20:53.389 --> 01:20:56.226
[grunting]

01:21:15.478 --> 01:21:18.982
[heavy breathing]

01:24:29.337 --> 01:24:31.707
[shivering]

01:24:39.514 --> 01:24:43.252
[engine revving]

01:24:55.663 --> 01:24:58.701
[engine sound continues]

01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:16.217
[engine sound fades]

01:25:16.251 --> 01:25:18.720
[heavy breathing]

01:25:45.413 --> 01:25:49.451
[high pitched rhythmic noise]

01:26:23.818 --> 01:26:26.421
[water splashing]

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.347
[gunshots]

01:26:53.381 --> 01:26:54.616
[yelling]

01:27:06.428 --> 01:27:09.465
[gunshots]

01:27:25.781 --> 01:27:29.618
Sex, hunger...

01:27:30.486 --> 01:27:31.888
...shit!

01:27:34.857 --> 01:27:37.627
We are animals!

01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:43.700
There's one alone that sets
us apart from the beasts.

01:27:47.035 --> 01:27:48.802
What is war?

01:27:48.836 --> 01:27:50.806
Not to bind us.

01:27:53.841 --> 01:27:57.714
It gave us castles and cities and nations.

01:27:59.081 --> 01:28:03.553
Inside the walls, we built cities.

01:28:05.854 --> 01:28:08.925
Around the armies we formed nations.

01:28:18.599 --> 01:28:20.535
[grunting]

01:28:34.015 --> 01:28:39.589
You see, there is a beauty in the darkness.

01:28:42.224 --> 01:28:43.860
A purpose.

01:28:45.794 --> 01:28:47.596
[horse whinnies]

01:28:50.666 --> 01:28:52.869
Parley, son!

01:28:54.502 --> 01:28:56.639
Parley and talk!

01:29:00.041 --> 01:29:02.978
Come to me and parley, boy!

01:29:06.915 --> 01:29:08.718
Come to me!

01:29:15.623 --> 01:29:19.127
I alone know you.

01:29:19.161 --> 01:29:21.529
You suspected you were meant for greatness,

01:29:21.563 --> 01:29:24.932
but I knew, I told you,

01:29:24.966 --> 01:29:27.603
I birthed you!

01:29:28.504 --> 01:29:29.937
And now that you have tasted

01:29:29.971 --> 01:29:34.641
that hot salt of life, you are high.

01:29:34.675 --> 01:29:39.014
Your blood runs with a quicksilver pulse.

01:29:39.747 --> 01:29:41.983
But you are afraid.

01:29:43.785 --> 01:29:44.985
[grunting]

01:29:45.019 --> 01:29:48.190
Boldness is best tasted in the first gulp.

01:29:50.626 --> 01:29:53.463
But the buzz is wearing thin.

01:30:00.702 --> 01:30:06.742
A step faltered... and breath cut short.

01:30:08.644 --> 01:30:10.847
Shallowness in the belly.

01:30:13.681 --> 01:30:16.719
For greatness is too much to bear alone.

01:30:19.054 --> 01:30:22.757
And now you long for another shoulder.

01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:31.767
Come to me.

01:30:34.736 --> 01:30:37.172
Come and rest your head.

01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:03.798
[grunts]

01:31:13.108 --> 01:31:15.845
Have you told yourself you hate me?

01:31:20.181 --> 01:31:21.651
Come here.

01:31:22.783 --> 01:31:25.787
Do you hate me, boy? Huh?

01:31:28.657 --> 01:31:31.325
David thought he hated Goliath.

01:31:31.359 --> 01:31:33.727
Then he stood alone on that field,

01:31:33.761 --> 01:31:36.131
the Israelite's in their tents,

01:31:37.632 --> 01:31:39.601
the Philistines in theirs.

01:31:39.635 --> 01:31:42.369
One man joined him on that battle field.

01:31:42.403 --> 01:31:45.205
Enemies, who do we have,

01:31:45.239 --> 01:31:47.775
but each other?

01:31:47.809 --> 01:31:50.278
Come to know what you've always known,

01:31:50.312 --> 01:31:54.684
- what you were born knowing!
- [groans]

01:31:55.884 --> 01:32:00.723
War, war is how men love.

01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:03.858
Now come...

01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:08.730
Come and kiss.

01:32:08.764 --> 01:32:09.799
[gunshot]

01:32:25.846 --> 01:32:28.617
[panting]

01:34:00.442 --> 01:34:04.145
[music plays on radio]

01:34:04.179 --> 01:34:06.449
Welcome to Cow Town.

01:34:13.921 --> 01:34:17.425
[heavy breathing]

01:34:28.403 --> 01:34:30.906
[water running]

01:35:00.434 --> 01:35:02.804
Sir, can I help you?

01:35:03.572 --> 01:35:04.907
Nope.

01:36:56.451 --> 01:36:58.921
What are you doing?

01:37:10.998 --> 01:37:13.601
What is going on?

01:37:13.635 --> 01:37:18.073
[woman] He says he was a
friend of Brad's in Mexico.

01:37:42.162 --> 01:37:44.399
[Mitch exhales]

01:37:57.144 --> 01:37:59.447
