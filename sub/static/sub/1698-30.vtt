 <i>¶ Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa ¶</i>      

00:58.023 --> 01:00.192
  Is it because you're worried  
    about Blue Jeans?           

01:00.193 --> 01:02.227
Yeah,                           
but it's not just that.         

01:02.228 --> 01:04.062
 I mean, I brought              
Blue Jeans out here             

01:04.063 --> 01:05.630
    because I thought           
    he was missing me.          

01:05.631 --> 01:08.766
 But last night, I realized it  
was really me missing Tennessee.

01:08.767 --> 01:10.768
      Let me guess:             

01:10.769 --> 01:13.238
    Your talking horse          
         told you this?         

01:13.239 --> 01:17.242
    Dad, I am not gonna make    
  this important of a decision  

01:17.243 --> 01:19.143
 because a talking horse        
     told me to.                

01:20.346 --> 01:22.113
    I argued with him           
    until he turned into me,    

01:22.114 --> 01:24.649
  and as you and I both know,   
 it's useless to argue with me. 

01:25.784 --> 01:27.652
            I hear that.        

01:27.653 --> 01:29.654
        Dad, look,              

01:29.655 --> 01:31.690
        it may seem like        
I'm not thinking straight.      

01:31.691 --> 01:33.758
And maybe I'm not,              
    but it's just               

01:33.759 --> 01:36.461
I can't shake this feeling      
  of wanting to go back home.   

01:36.462 --> 01:39.030
Something that you're missing   
back home in Tennessee?         

01:39.031 --> 01:40.599
      So you're not mad?        

01:40.600 --> 01:42.601
No, of course not.              

01:42.602 --> 01:45.837
I mean, this is                 
a really important decision,    

01:45.838 --> 01:48.106
and we don't need to rush it.   

01:48.107 --> 01:49.507
We need to take a step back     

01:49.508 --> 01:52.744
and give this the consideration 
    that it deserves.           

01:54.012 --> 01:57.181
 We're going back               
  to Tennessee.                 

01:57.182 --> 02:00.485
And leave Lilly?                
How can you be so cold?         

02:00.486 --> 02:02.019
 We'll take her with us.        

02:02.020 --> 02:04.289
  Dad, Lilly's not gonna        
wanna come with us.             

02:04.290 --> 02:05.624
California is her home.         

02:05.625 --> 02:08.259
          And besides,          
  Oliver and her dad are here.  

02:08.261 --> 02:09.426
        Think a little.         

02:10.996 --> 02:12.564
      Okay, I am thinking,      

02:12.565 --> 02:15.533
and what I'm thinking is,       
    my dad always told me       

02:15.534 --> 02:17.435
         when a female          
      is having a problem       

02:17.436 --> 02:19.471
        and tries to drag you   
          into the middle of it,

02:19.472 --> 02:23.475
  the best thing you can do is  
 smile, nod and compliment her. 

02:23.476 --> 02:25.943
Dad, it's not that simple.      

02:25.944 --> 02:28.647
    I mean, ugh, sure,          
      Oliver will be okay,      

02:28.648 --> 02:30.915
 but, I mean, what about Lilly? 
    She just moved in.          

02:30.916 --> 02:33.050
    How can I abandon           
my best friend like this?       

02:33.051 --> 02:37.622
        Oh, my goodness.        
 You look lovely this morning.  

02:37.623 --> 02:39.190
     It's not gonna work.       

02:39.191 --> 02:42.494
 Did you do something different 
         to your hair?          

02:42.495 --> 02:43.628
                    Oh, good,   
                      you're up.

02:43.629 --> 02:45.463
    Oh, good, you're here.      
              Listen,           

02:45.464 --> 02:46.898
    I gotta go to the store.    

02:46.899 --> 02:49.434
Compliment her                  
and stay close to the exit.     

02:49.435 --> 02:50.868
    Good luck.                  

02:50.869 --> 02:51.969
                 ( door closes )

02:51.970 --> 02:55.039
      Hey. Nice pajamas.        

02:57.075 --> 02:59.411
      Okay, where's Lilly?      
      She still sleeping?       

02:59.412 --> 03:02.347
         Yep. Poor kid.         

03:02.348 --> 03:04.816
            Sailing away        
    on the ship of dreams.      

03:04.817 --> 03:06.518
                  Little does   
              she know that, uh,

03:06.519 --> 03:09.921
        I'm about to wake her up
        and crush that ship     

03:09.922 --> 03:12.791
    into the brutal rocks       
            of reality.         

03:12.792 --> 03:15.092
        Uh, okay.               
        ( door opens )          

03:16.562 --> 03:18.095
                Say her manicure
                looks nice.     

03:18.096 --> 03:20.598
Your manicure looks nice.       
        Stop that.              

03:20.599 --> 03:21.999
          Okay, fine.           
     Your tips are chipped,     

03:22.000 --> 03:23.835
    and your pajamas,           
      a little bit frumpy.      

03:25.137 --> 03:27.104
Can we talk about me            
for a minute?                   

03:27.105 --> 03:29.341
The most exciting thing         
    happened last night.        

03:29.342 --> 03:30.809
So I was over at Jackson's,     

03:30.810 --> 03:33.345
 and there's this band          
that lives upstairs, and...     

03:33.346 --> 03:34.713
         ( sighs )              

03:34.714 --> 03:36.481
             All right.         

03:36.482 --> 03:38.916
    All right, that's just gonna
        have to work for now.   

03:38.917 --> 03:40.352
      ( knocking on door )      

03:40.353 --> 03:42.420
                Oh, no.         

03:46.459 --> 03:48.360
  Dude, your door's busted.     

03:48.361 --> 03:50.628
                Dude, I know.   

03:51.764 --> 03:53.965
         Hey, look, um,         

03:53.966 --> 03:55.266
      we're rehearsing upstairs,

03:55.267 --> 03:57.034
      and all this banging      
    going on down here          

03:57.035 --> 03:59.471
          is kind of            
        harshing the vibe.      

03:59.472 --> 04:03.007
You're Trent Stone              
 from Tepid Funk.               

04:03.008 --> 04:04.141
          ( gasping ):          
          What? Wait.           

04:04.142 --> 04:06.411
Who cares?                      
Y-You're Oliver Oken            

04:06.412 --> 04:08.179
from <i>America's Top Talent.</i>      
            Yeah.               

04:08.180 --> 04:09.914
You're the best thing           
that happened to music          

04:09.915 --> 04:11.383
since the air guitar, dude.     

04:11.384 --> 04:13.752
( imitating guitar )            

04:13.753 --> 04:15.687
You know what would be          
the coolest thing ever?         

04:15.688 --> 04:16.821
            Huh?                

04:16.822 --> 04:18.356
If you opened for us.           

04:18.357 --> 04:20.257
        Oh, well...             

04:20.259 --> 04:22.594
    Please?                     

04:24.329 --> 04:27.699
          Okay.                 
Yay! Yay! Yay!                  

04:27.700 --> 04:29.267
Thank you.                      

04:30.903 --> 04:32.370
        Really?                 

04:32.371 --> 04:35.407
    Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay?    

04:35.408 --> 04:39.043
Okay, it didn't happen          
  exactly like that,            

04:39.044 --> 04:42.847
but they did ask me to open     
for them on their world tour.   

04:42.848 --> 04:45.049
    World tour?                 
Yeah.                           

04:45.050 --> 04:47.886
     How much of the world      
     are we talking about?      

04:47.887 --> 04:49.353
    Six months.                 

04:49.354 --> 04:53.491
Six months? You're gonna        
 leave Lilly for six months?    

04:53.492 --> 04:56.528
I know. That's why I'm so happy 
    she has you to lean on.     

04:56.529 --> 04:59.096
    You know, think about it.   
        I mean, her mom's moved,

04:59.097 --> 05:01.132
her dad's an hour away.         

05:01.133 --> 05:02.934
          Without me,           
     you're all she's got.      

05:02.935 --> 05:05.369
            You know, you're it.

05:05.370 --> 05:08.039
    You're the center           
     of her universe.           

05:08.040 --> 05:09.874
             All right?         
All the roads lead back to...   

05:09.875 --> 05:11.108
        I'm moving back         
         to Tennessee.          

05:11.109 --> 05:13.344
     Backstabbing best friends  
             say what?          

05:15.448 --> 05:18.015
          <i>¶ Ooh, ooh ¶</i>          

05:18.016 --> 05:19.751
            Man, this stinks.   

05:19.752 --> 05:22.153
         I know.                
How are we gonna tell her       

05:22.154 --> 05:23.822
that both of us                 
 are leaving?                   

05:25.758 --> 05:27.191
Don't even                      
think about it.                 

05:27.192 --> 05:28.827
        ( grunts )              

05:28.828 --> 05:30.361
        You know, you knew      
        without looking,        

05:30.362 --> 05:32.430
         and it's that kind of  
      sensitivity that makes you

05:32.431 --> 05:33.998
              the perfect person
                to tell Lilly.  

05:33.999 --> 05:35.467
      Tell me what?             

05:35.468 --> 05:38.670
            Uh...               
that it's a beautiful morning,  

05:38.671 --> 05:40.839
        and we're taking you out
        for a we-love-Lilly day.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.206
          Because we love Lilly.
    Yeah.                       

05:42.207 --> 05:43.475
         And we want you        
        to remember that.       

05:43.476 --> 05:44.542
    Forever.                    

05:44.543 --> 05:47.244
                  Aw, come here.
                    Come here.  

05:47.245 --> 05:48.746
        Okay. Ah.               
  Lilly, mm.                    

05:48.747 --> 05:50.281
Okay. What--? What's going on?  
            Okay.               

05:50.282 --> 05:52.550
             Why does something 
            have to be going on?

05:52.551 --> 05:54.118
        Can't two people        
    who care about you          

05:54.119 --> 05:55.987
        just give you a day full
         of wonderful memories? 

05:55.988 --> 05:58.089
Memories that will carry you    
through the hard times          

05:58.090 --> 06:01.258
that life inevitably            
throws at you?                  

06:01.259 --> 06:03.127
      Would you both stop       
    smiling at me like that?    

06:03.128 --> 06:05.029
      'Cause it's kind of       
        creeping me out.        

06:05.030 --> 06:07.431
 Absolutely.                    
         No problem.            

06:10.068 --> 06:11.268
What did I just say?            

06:11.269 --> 06:12.971
    Sorry.                      
          Sorry. My bad.        

06:14.339 --> 06:16.474
        So let's get packing.   
  Cracking.                     

06:16.475 --> 06:19.377
                  Uh...         
  Let's get cracking, ha, ha.   

06:19.378 --> 06:21.813
Because packing                 
would be stupid.                

06:21.814 --> 06:24.015
             <i>¶ Oh ¶</i>             

06:24.016 --> 06:26.384
             TRENT:             
     One, two, three, four.     

06:26.385 --> 06:29.587
  ( band playing rock music )   

06:36.128 --> 06:39.130
            Rico!               

06:44.503 --> 06:46.437
    ( glass shatters )          

06:46.438 --> 06:48.072
            ( thud )            

06:51.476 --> 06:53.244
     ( whimpers )               

06:53.245 --> 06:54.679
          <i>¶ Ooh, yeah ¶</i>         

06:54.680 --> 06:56.648
         <i>¶ Whoa, whoa ¶</i>         

06:56.649 --> 06:59.483
    Now, I don't know           
        about you,              

06:59.484 --> 07:01.653
but this is a day               
I will never forget.            

07:01.654 --> 07:03.454
 Never, ever, ever.             

07:03.455 --> 07:04.756
      Ever.                     

07:04.757 --> 07:06.290
        Yeah, me too,           
         but, I mean,           

07:06.291 --> 07:08.225
    you didn't have to buy me   
          a whole new outfit.   

07:08.226 --> 07:09.827
            I-I-I think         
         I'm gonna take it back.

07:09.828 --> 07:11.696
    Oh, please,                 
 do not be ridonkulous.         

07:11.697 --> 07:13.464
      I mean,                   
you look adorable.              

07:13.465 --> 07:15.900
And besides,                    
you already sweat in it, so...  

07:15.901 --> 07:18.169
            You're right, I did.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.038
            Thank you,          
        overactive sweat glands.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.273
         ( high-pitched voice ):
          You're welcome, Lilly.

07:22.274 --> 07:25.777
Oh, you're so cute.             
I'm gonna miss that when        

07:25.778 --> 07:28.279
I'm in somewhere                
that you're not,                

07:28.280 --> 07:30.048
 and we can't                   
see each other,                 

07:30.049 --> 07:32.216
heh, because we're not...       

07:32.217 --> 07:34.586
( laughing nervously )          

07:37.155 --> 07:41.726
  Well, somebody forgot         
their pictures in the car.      

07:41.727 --> 07:44.028
        Honestly, I mean,       
    I told you guys I--         

07:44.029 --> 07:46.430
I'd be okay with the little ones
    from the machine.           

07:46.431 --> 07:48.532
Oh, you silly Lilly.            

07:48.533 --> 07:49.901
  Everybody loses those.        

07:49.902 --> 07:52.904
      These jumbo puppies       
      are here to stay.         

07:52.905 --> 07:54.606
      So cute, ha, ha.          

07:54.607 --> 07:56.540
Okay. You keep saying           
    everything's okay,          

07:56.541 --> 07:58.242
and I go along with it          
    because, you know,          

07:58.243 --> 08:01.345
    I was-- I was hoping for    
  a matching purse, but, uh--   

08:01.346 --> 08:03.848
  Honestly, saying you love me  
      every five minutes,       

08:03.849 --> 08:05.984
          and wearing           
    the friendship bracelet     

08:05.985 --> 08:07.418
  I gave you three years ago.   

08:07.419 --> 08:08.753
     What gives?                

08:08.754 --> 08:10.488
All right, fine.                

08:10.489 --> 08:12.056
There's no easy way             
to say this.                    

08:13.626 --> 08:15.426
      ( sighs )                 

08:17.963 --> 08:20.331
I'm moving back to Tennessee.   

08:20.332 --> 08:23.635
        And I'm going on tour   
              with Tepid Funk.  

08:26.238 --> 08:28.472
Leaving you is the hardest thing
that I've ever had to do,       

08:28.473 --> 08:31.009
 but there's just something     
pulling me back to Tennessee.   

08:31.010 --> 08:34.912
         This is an unbelievable
        opportunity for me.     

08:34.913 --> 08:36.347
        ( sighs )               

08:36.347 --> 08:37.815
        Ugh, wow.               

08:37.816 --> 08:39.951
        Do you want a tissue?   

08:39.952 --> 08:42.186
  Do you wanna hit something?   

08:42.187 --> 08:43.453
      Maybe Oliver?             

08:44.890 --> 08:46.257
      Assume the position.      

08:48.861 --> 08:50.662
        ( whimpers )            

08:50.663 --> 08:52.396
Go ahead, Lilly.                

08:52.397 --> 08:53.631
  Lilly?                        

08:55.134 --> 08:56.701
    No, I-I understand.         

08:56.702 --> 08:58.136
        ( yells )               

08:58.137 --> 08:59.704
        ( whimpers )            

08:59.705 --> 09:02.106
         Wait, you do?          

09:02.107 --> 09:05.109
Yeah, Oliver, you're right.     
I mean,                         

09:05.110 --> 09:07.244
 you can't pass up              
something like this,            

09:07.245 --> 09:10.014
and I wouldn't                  
 want you to.                   

09:10.015 --> 09:12.249
I'm so proud of you.            

09:12.250 --> 09:14.351
          And, Miley,           
    I totally get it.           

09:14.352 --> 09:16.921
 If-- If your heart is telling  
  you to go back to Tennessee,  

09:16.922 --> 09:18.622
then you have to.               

09:18.623 --> 09:20.992
So you're not mad at me?        

09:20.993 --> 09:23.327
     No, of course not.         

09:23.328 --> 09:27.098
    I mean, I'm gonna miss both 
  of you guys like crazy, but...

09:27.099 --> 09:29.300
    it'll be okay.              

09:29.301 --> 09:30.935
                 Lilly,         
            you are amazing.    

09:30.936 --> 09:32.636
              I was so worried  
        that you'd freak out,   

09:32.637 --> 09:34.972
thinking I was one of those guys
      who goes on the road      

09:34.973 --> 09:36.640
         promising not to cheat,
        but then, you know,     

09:36.641 --> 09:39.944
            caves after         
the first cute girl who, uh--   

09:39.945 --> 09:42.914
     Well, let's be honest,     
just after the first cute girl. 

09:45.383 --> 09:47.218
      And I was terrified       

09:47.219 --> 09:49.520
  that you'd think I was gonna  
     go back to Tennessee,      

09:49.521 --> 09:50.822
 hang out with my old friends,  

09:50.823 --> 09:53.091
        get a new phone,        
forget to put your number in it,

09:53.092 --> 09:56.660
  and then you try to call me,  
      all lonely and sad,       

09:56.661 --> 09:57.995
        and all you hear        
    is a voice saying,          

09:57.996 --> 09:59.463
    "Oh, I'm sorry,             

09:59.464 --> 10:01.032
        "but this number        
     has been disconnected      

10:01.033 --> 10:03.101
      because she now has       
        cooler friends."        

10:03.102 --> 10:04.668
( chuckles )                    

10:04.669 --> 10:06.204
 Lilly?                         

10:06.205 --> 10:07.972
        Lillypop,               
         are you okay?          

10:07.973 --> 10:09.673
          ( angrily ):          
I was until you guys brought up 

10:09.674 --> 10:11.175
     that stuff you thought     
        I'd worry about         

10:11.176 --> 10:13.077
  that I wasn't worried about,  
         but now I am.          

10:13.078 --> 10:17.481
        Oh, no.                 
Lilly, please don't cry.        

10:17.482 --> 10:19.483
  Okay, you know what, Lilly?   
          I won't go.           

10:20.685 --> 10:22.319
          I'll give up          
    my dreams for you.          

10:22.320 --> 10:25.790
Oh, what, so you can stay       
and grow to hate me?            

10:25.791 --> 10:28.192
         ( whimpers ):          
        Oh, yeah,               
  that's a much better choice.  

10:29.327 --> 10:30.962
 Okay, fine,                    
then I'll stay.                 

10:30.963 --> 10:33.697
So you're so bitter             
you can't even look at me       

10:33.698 --> 10:35.900
without seeing                  
the soul-sucking leech          

10:35.901 --> 10:38.302
    who kept you from           
     following your heart?      

10:38.303 --> 10:40.704
Why does saying goodbye         
 have to hurt so much?          

10:40.705 --> 10:42.106
             I know.            
        ( sighs )               

10:42.107 --> 10:44.341
         Why can't we be        
         more like them?        

10:46.411 --> 10:49.747
        ( all sobbing )         

10:49.748 --> 10:52.549
             LILLY:             
I think I need that tissue now.

          ( sobbing )           

11:07.866 --> 11:10.401
How much time do we have left?  
Well,                           

11:10.402 --> 11:13.604
we just have to wait for my dad 
to find a ranch in Tennessee.   

11:13.605 --> 11:15.406
        ( whimpering ):         
             But...             

11:15.407 --> 11:18.309
let's not think about that now. 
                Okay.           

11:18.310 --> 11:20.778
            Whoo!               
     Great, you're still here.  

11:20.779 --> 11:23.580
                 I just found   
              the perfect ranch.

11:23.581 --> 11:25.149
You're gonna love it.           

11:25.150 --> 11:27.718
Thanks a lot, Dad.              
            Yeah.               

11:27.719 --> 11:29.253
      I'm so happy for you.     

11:29.254 --> 11:30.888

11:35.493 --> 11:37.594
    Pfft!                       

11:37.595 --> 11:39.663
    Girls.                      

11:39.664 --> 11:41.632
They are so emotional.          

11:43.836 --> 11:46.037

12:18.971 --> 12:21.739
            Come on in, y-y-you.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.942
    Welcome to paradise,        
      population: <i>moi.</i>          

12:24.943 --> 12:26.110
        ( chuckles )            

12:26.111 --> 12:27.544
                 You'll have to 
            forgive the mess.   

12:27.545 --> 12:29.147
      Uh, I'm just doing        
     a little remodeling        

12:29.148 --> 12:31.849
         because I just         
    love this place so much.    

12:33.152 --> 12:35.086
    You like my table?          

12:35.087 --> 12:37.855
                It's a table    
            and a place to stand

12:37.856 --> 12:40.158
             if I ever have     
    a regular-size date, heh,   

12:40.159 --> 12:44.461
         which I will,          
because my apartment is awesome.

12:44.462 --> 12:47.799
Jackson, I have a problem,      
and I need to talk to somebody. 

12:47.800 --> 12:49.200
        Because, like,          

12:49.201 --> 12:51.202
      the 6 billion people      

12:51.203 --> 12:52.603
that you'd come to              
    before me                   

12:52.604 --> 12:55.273
have just sort of               
mysteriously vanished?          

12:55.274 --> 12:56.607
Oh, wait. No.                   

12:56.608 --> 12:58.642
See about a half a dozen of them
      out there right now.      

12:58.643 --> 13:01.545
  Oh! There's a guy talking     
to pigeons across the street.   

13:01.546 --> 13:04.248
Seems like he really enjoys     
  a nice conversation.          

13:04.249 --> 13:06.050
    Jackson, I'm serious.       

13:06.051 --> 13:08.219
        I told Dad that         
I wanna move back to Tennessee, 

13:08.220 --> 13:11.088
 and before I could even blink, 
    he found a place.           

13:11.089 --> 13:14.091
          W-Wait, um,           
    we're moving back home?     

13:14.092 --> 13:15.559
Well, Dad and I are,            

13:15.560 --> 13:17.661
 but, I mean, you seem to like  
    this apartment so much,     

13:17.662 --> 13:19.030
 I wouldn't expect you to come. 

13:19.031 --> 13:21.465
    Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!           
     I mean, yes, yes, I...     

13:21.466 --> 13:23.701
I-I-I love this apartment.      
      I love it.                

13:23.702 --> 13:28.039
Uh, but-- But not more than     
the family unit, you know?      

13:28.040 --> 13:29.807
         I would insist         
that Dad pay off the lease      

13:29.808 --> 13:33.277
 so, that way, the family unit  
could remain unified and united 

13:33.278 --> 13:37.348
and, you know...in a unit.      

13:37.349 --> 13:38.950
  You hate it here, don't you?  

13:38.951 --> 13:40.551
         ( whimpers ):          
    It's a nightmare.           

13:40.552 --> 13:43.020
     It's...                    

13:43.021 --> 13:44.655
        Look, i-if--            

13:44.656 --> 13:46.790
If we move back to Tennessee,   
I won't have to admit to Dad    

13:46.791 --> 13:49.393
that my first decision          
    as an adult was, uh,        

13:49.394 --> 13:50.828
    ( couch spring clangs )     

13:50.829 --> 13:52.096
    ( whimpers )                

13:52.097 --> 13:53.898
     a complete disaster.       

13:53.899 --> 13:55.366
    Oh, no...                   

13:55.367 --> 13:57.668
      How did this become       
         such a mess?           

13:57.669 --> 13:58.903
I don't know.                   

13:58.904 --> 14:00.338
 An incompetent furniture maker 

14:00.339 --> 14:02.740
         with no pride          
      in his workmanship.       

14:02.741 --> 14:06.878
              Jackson,          
    I was talking about my life.

14:06.879 --> 14:10.714
     I mean, part of me wants   
 to go back to Tennessee, and...

14:10.715 --> 14:14.252
     part of me...loves it here.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.321
  And how can I leave Lilly?    

14:17.322 --> 14:18.389
        ( sighs )               

14:18.390 --> 14:19.623
      What do I do?             

14:19.624 --> 14:22.426
          I love you,           
 but I don't have your answers. 

14:23.929 --> 14:26.497
    Wait, I-I think I might     
  know something that'll help.  

14:26.498 --> 14:28.465
     I'm not talking            
    to the pigeon guy.          

14:28.466 --> 14:30.401
     No, I'm talking about      
          Blue Jeans.           

14:30.402 --> 14:31.802
You should go for a ride. That--

14:31.803 --> 14:34.038
     That always seems like     
when you do your best thinking. 

14:34.039 --> 14:38.475
Yeah, you're right. Wow.        

14:38.476 --> 14:42.579
    Such simple words,          
yet they taste like vomit.      

14:42.580 --> 14:45.349
Uh, "Thank you, Jackson,"       
would be enough.                

14:45.350 --> 14:46.483
             Thank you, Jackson.

14:48.686 --> 14:51.422
    Not as bad this time,       
    but still gonna need a mint.

14:52.857 --> 14:54.258

          <i>¶ Whoa, ooh ¶</i>         

14:57.896 --> 15:00.631
Right now I wish                
you really could talk.          

15:00.632 --> 15:02.633
    And maybe then              
you could tell me what to do.   

15:02.634 --> 15:04.068
            ( whinnies )        

15:08.941 --> 15:11.909

you're funny,                   

15:11.910 --> 15:15.913
and now you have                
my lucky bracelet.              

15:15.914 --> 15:18.015
         Hey,                   
I have a lucky bracelet         

15:18.016 --> 15:19.183
 just like that.                

15:19.184 --> 15:21.052
        I loaned it             
to my best friend yesterday.    

15:21.053 --> 15:25.156
Of course, mine says            
"Lilly" on the back.            

15:25.157 --> 15:28.159
Just like that.

             Sorry.             

16:23.781 --> 16:25.582
Up here doing a little thinking?

16:25.583 --> 16:27.618
        Oh, yeah.               

16:27.619 --> 16:29.753
            I mean,             
  I know I need more Tennessee  

16:29.754 --> 16:31.555
  back in my life, it just...   

16:31.556 --> 16:33.024
          Something--           

16:33.025 --> 16:35.959
  Something doesn't feel right  
  about leaving my life here.   

16:35.960 --> 16:37.628
    Especially Lilly.           

16:37.629 --> 16:40.231
         Yeah. I mean,          
how can going back to Tennessee 

16:40.232 --> 16:41.798
  be the right decision         

16:41.799 --> 16:44.835
if it makes me and the people   
that I love so unhappy?         

16:46.204 --> 16:50.674
    Daddy, I don't think        
        I can do it.            

16:50.675 --> 16:51.975
I know that, darling.           

16:51.976 --> 16:53.977
    I could tell by the way     
 you were acting this morning.  

16:53.978 --> 16:56.347
     Then why'd you go off      
 and buy a ranch in Tennessee?  

16:56.348 --> 16:58.315
        I didn't.               
         What?                  

16:58.316 --> 17:00.484
         I could tell you needed
            to be in Tennessee  

17:00.485 --> 17:02.520
            and California both,

17:02.521 --> 17:04.521
        so I found a way        
  we could meet in the middle.  

17:04.522 --> 17:06.557
    You bought a ranch          
          in Oklahoma?          

17:06.558 --> 17:09.492
     No. Actually, it's a little
          closer than that.     

17:09.493 --> 17:11.561
         Twenty acres.          
    Cute little barn.           

17:11.563 --> 17:13.964
 Kind of like a Crowley Corners 
        down by the sea.        

17:13.964 --> 17:14.964
        You did not.            

17:14.965 --> 17:16.934
         See that place         
        right over there?       

17:19.137 --> 17:20.637
 You bought that place?         

17:20.637 --> 17:23.207
      It's not Tennessee,       
 but it's pretty daggone close. 

17:23.208 --> 17:24.840
      It's better.              

17:24.842 --> 17:26.609
      It's perfect.             

17:26.611 --> 17:28.112
  There's room for everybody.   

17:28.113 --> 17:30.981
Lilly, Blue Jeans,              

17:30.982 --> 17:34.385
and even Jackson.               

17:34.386 --> 17:36.587
        I'll fill you in        
         on that later.         

17:36.588 --> 17:38.089
Thank you so much, Daddy.       

17:38.090 --> 17:39.390
    I love you, Mile.           

17:39.391 --> 17:41.225

17:57.175 --> 17:59.510
     Seeing it all empty        
      is kind of sad.

              you and Miley

            living together.

            being on tour       

18:06.318 --> 18:07.518
      knowing that you have her.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.286
You better call me              
    every day.                  

18:09.287 --> 18:10.854
        I'm gonna call you      
              twice a day.

        ( sighs )               

18:11.990 --> 18:13.157
  Yeah, but can you make sure   

18:13.158 --> 18:14.592
    it's not too early          
    and not too late?           

18:14.593 --> 18:16.793
All right, fine,                
 call whenever,                 

18:16.794 --> 18:18.395
  but I wanna talk to you too.

Yeah, but seriously,

 doing up there?                

18:30.008 --> 18:31.375
    I don't know. He's, uh,

18:46.558 --> 18:49.160
  The most powerful hair dryer  
         known to man.          

18:50.362 --> 18:52.029
             Can I--?           
You wanna keep that hand, son?  

18:52.030 --> 18:54.298
            Yes, sir.           

18:54.299 --> 18:57.034
        ( whimpering ):         
And, uh, goodbye, stairs.       

18:58.236 --> 19:02.640
Goodbye spot                    
where I kissed Andrea Strand.   

19:02.641 --> 19:06.443
          Goodbye spot          
where Andrea Strand Tasered me. 

19:06.444 --> 19:09.513
      Goodbye spot where I      
stepped over your twitching body

19:09.514 --> 19:11.748
  to run and go get my camera.  
( Lilly and Oliver chuckling )  

19:11.749 --> 19:14.017
    Come on, Jackson,           
 you got a great apartment now, 

19:14.018 --> 19:15.553
        and you're only         
     ten miles up the road.     

19:15.554 --> 19:17.854
        Yeah. Yeah, I do.       

19:17.855 --> 19:19.190
     It's furnished. It's--     

19:19.191 --> 19:20.824
It's right near the beach.      

19:20.825 --> 19:22.259
I've never been so happy.       

19:22.260 --> 19:23.694
            ( sobs )            

19:23.695 --> 19:25.796
              See?              

19:25.797 --> 19:28.666
Well, this is great.            
We're all gonna be happy now.   

19:28.667 --> 19:30.934
Oliver's hitting the road,      

19:30.935 --> 19:33.370
you up there                    
in your little apartment,       

19:33.371 --> 19:35.739
and me, Miley and Lilly         
out there at the new ranch      

19:35.740 --> 19:39.876
with the heated swimming pool   
and two hot tubs,               

19:39.877 --> 19:41.978
 so whichever side of the house 
        you're on,              

19:41.979 --> 19:43.614
you're only steps away          

19:43.615 --> 19:47.918
from 72 pulsating jets          
  of pure paradise.             

19:47.919 --> 19:49.286
        Seventy-two?            

19:49.287 --> 19:51.922
  That's not even counting      
the ones that go up and down    

19:51.923 --> 19:53.924
                and up and down.

19:53.925 --> 19:56.159
( whimpering )                  

19:56.160 --> 19:57.561
Dad,                            

19:57.562 --> 19:59.530
     how long are you gonna     
 torture him till you tell him  

19:59.531 --> 20:00.931
     that you got him           
     out of his lease           

20:00.932 --> 20:02.165
    and he's coming with us?    

20:02.166 --> 20:03.934
What?                           
         Come on, Mile.         

20:03.935 --> 20:07.070
        I had two more minutes  
     of great material lined up.

20:07.071 --> 20:09.906
        Thank you,              
     thank you, thank you.      

20:09.907 --> 20:11.508
     You're welcome,            
         son.                   

20:11.509 --> 20:13.744
All right, everybody,           
let's get a move on, now.       

20:13.745 --> 20:15.546
  We got a new                  
ranch to fix up.                

20:15.547 --> 20:17.047
Or as I like to say,            

20:17.048 --> 20:19.149
a ranch that needs              
  some dressing.                

20:20.418 --> 20:22.119
    Get it?                     
Ranch dressing.                 

20:22.120 --> 20:24.921
Whoo! Good thing Robby Ray      
packed up the humor. Let's go.  

20:33.965 --> 20:35.466
              Come on, Miley,   
          it's time to say hello

20:35.467 --> 20:37.067
                to our new home.

20:37.068 --> 20:39.436
  And goodbye                   
to the old one.                 

20:50.482 --> 20:52.483
 ( <i>melancholic theme playing</i> )  

20:55.420 --> 20:58.589
       <i>¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>       

20:58.590 --> 21:01.392
         <i>¶ Yeah ¶</i>               

21:03.761 --> 21:05.896
 Here's your keys.              
        Thank you.              

21:05.897 --> 21:07.531
  ( band playing rock music )   
     Heh!                       

21:07.532 --> 21:10.734
      Yeah. Uh, good luck       
     finding another sucker     

21:10.735 --> 21:11.935
      to rent this place.       

21:11.936 --> 21:15.105
Hey, hey. A coat of paint,      
some new cabinets,              

21:15.106 --> 21:16.540
a little wood glue,             

21:16.541 --> 21:19.609
and another sucker              
will be knocking down the door. 

21:19.610 --> 21:22.546
        Hopefully               
after he signs the lease.       

21:22.547 --> 21:24.148
          ( cracking )          

21:26.351 --> 21:29.086
      Oh!                       
     ( band stops playing )     

21:32.924 --> 21:35.359
     We gotta work this bit     
         into the show.         

21:35.360 --> 21:37.694
One, two,                       
three, four.
