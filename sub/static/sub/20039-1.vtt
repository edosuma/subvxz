00:07.333 --> 00:10.233
Today I spoke on the phone
with promoters in Las Vegas.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.600
They want to give you
a residency show.

00:11.667 --> 00:13.333
Vegas!

00:13.400 --> 00:14.900
(George)
It's an oasis in the middle
of the desert

00:14.967 --> 00:16.667
where all your problems
evaporate.

00:16.733 --> 00:17.933
Thank you, everybody!

00:18.000 --> 00:19.633
You're gonna be doing
eight shows a week...

00:19.700 --> 00:20.667
for the next three years!

00:20.733 --> 00:22.267
Minimum, you're gonna be
doing this

00:22.333 --> 00:24.100
for the rest of your life.

00:24.167 --> 00:25.600
(all laugh and cheer)

00:26.967 --> 00:29.233
Manolo, it's horrible, dude.

00:29.300 --> 00:32.233
Every day
for the last six months,

00:32.300 --> 00:34.800
I take the same elevator
from my suite

00:34.867 --> 00:36.867
down to the main floor.

00:36.933 --> 00:40.567
And then I walk to the same
casino into the same theater

00:40.633 --> 00:43.500
and I-- and I do
the same damn show.

00:43.567 --> 00:47.600
No-- no variations.
They-- they don't want that.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.233
(sighs, stammers)

00:49.300 --> 00:51.533
And then when I'm done, I--

00:51.600 --> 00:54.600
I take the same elevator
back to my suite.

00:54.667 --> 00:58.900
I'm like a Mexican gerbil
trapped in an Anglo Habitrail.

00:58.967 --> 01:00.367
I might not see sun,
Manolo.

01:00.433 --> 01:03.667
I might not even breathe
fresh air all day.

01:03.733 --> 01:06.833
The monotony, it--
it's killing me.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.767
It's killing me.

01:08.833 --> 01:10.333
That's terrible.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.333
You're an artist.
You need to be stimulated.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.333
Yes, thank you, Manolo.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.533
Donald Trump is president,
man, I got things to say.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.733
Man, I wish you were
in Vegas with me.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.233
Me too, jefe.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.600
Well, actually, anywhere
out of jail would be better.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.667
Manolo, you violated parole
for me, man.

01:24.733 --> 01:25.867
I'm never gonna forget that.

01:25.933 --> 01:27.567
I would do it again,
but this time

01:27.633 --> 01:29.400
I probably wouldn't post
pictures on Facebook.

01:29.467 --> 01:33.100
You know, the-- the 48 hours
that I've been in L.A., dude,

01:33.167 --> 01:36.133
I feel like I'm on parole,
like I can finally breathe.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.833
Wrap it up.
Visitation is over!

01:38.900 --> 01:40.067
Oh, man.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.533
I've gotta get you
outta here.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.733
I mean, you can't--
you can't live like this.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.067
(woman)
Oh, hell no!

01:45.067 --> 01:46.333
Hey, what are you
doing here?!

01:46.400 --> 01:48.067
Get the hell outta here!
Nobody wants you here.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.133
You better go.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.667
Damn.
You better walk, bitch.

01:50.733 --> 01:52.200
Damn, dude, it's like
somebody's wife and girlfriend

01:52.267 --> 01:53.600
just met for the first time.

01:53.667 --> 01:56.367
Oh, he's not married.
That's my roommate, Hector.

01:56.433 --> 01:58.600
He has all kinds of females
visiting him all the time.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.367
Uh, Manolo, listen,
you're in lockup.

02:00.433 --> 02:01.833
They don't call 'em
roommates, all right?

02:01.900 --> 02:03.133
They're called cell mates.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.300
You're in jail,
you're not at UCLA.

02:05.367 --> 02:06.767
(woman)
George Lopez!

02:06.833 --> 02:08.733
Mommy?

02:08.800 --> 02:10.900
(woman speaking Spanish)

02:18.100 --> 02:19.867
Hey, she says hi.

02:19.933 --> 02:21.067
Uhh...

02:21.100 --> 02:23.233
**

02:27.067 --> 02:28.067
(George)
Ohh...

02:28.100 --> 02:30.800
Oh, my God!
This meal!

02:30.867 --> 02:32.733
This food is so good.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.133
You don't get food
like this in Las Vegas.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.567
I'm on a new diet where I'm
allowed to eat anything I want,

02:42.633 --> 02:44.367
but only for 90 minutes
a day.

02:44.433 --> 02:47.233
Studies with mice have shown
that it improves mental acuity,

02:47.300 --> 02:49.367
builds muscle mass,
and improves reflexes.

02:49.433 --> 02:51.733
In mice?
Mm-hmm, try me.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.267
Hey, it's so fun connecting with
you while you're back in L.A.

02:57.333 --> 02:58.767
Yeah.
And I'm gonna be in Vegas
next week, so...

02:58.833 --> 03:00.533
Yeah, you know what,
the San Francisco Giants

03:00.600 --> 03:02.633
are playing the Dodgers
next week.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.733
Okay.
Yeah, I love it

03:05.800 --> 03:07.500
when we play the Giants
at Dodgers Stadium.

03:07.567 --> 03:09.367
Man, hey, you think we'll
get Manolo sprung by then?

03:09.433 --> 03:12.267
I could work on that.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.800
My uncle's a judge and--

03:13.867 --> 03:16.267
and if Manolo wears long sleeves
to the parole hearing,

03:16.333 --> 03:17.767
he should be just fine.
That's fantastic.

03:17.833 --> 03:19.967
I love seeing Manolo
intimidate that Giant fan.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.467
Stared him down.
Can't wait.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.800
I bet you can't wait...

03:23.867 --> 03:26.333
to hear all about the game
when Manolo calls you

03:26.400 --> 03:27.900
while you're in Vegas?

03:27.967 --> 03:29.933
Yeah, that's why I thought
we should have lunch, Olly.

03:30.067 --> 03:31.367
I'm not going back to Vegas.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.200
(George)
That was good.
George...

03:35.267 --> 03:36.833
you have to go back
to Vegas.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.200
You have a contract.
So?

03:38.267 --> 03:40.667
Pete Carroll had a contract.
Nick Saban had a contract.

03:40.733 --> 03:42.200
I don't know
what those names mean.

03:42.267 --> 03:44.333
Those names mean
I'm not going back to Vegas.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.600
Olly, you can always
get out of a contract.

03:46.667 --> 03:49.200
But George, you begged me
to get you that residency.

03:49.267 --> 03:50.367
Sheila and I got it
for you.

03:50.433 --> 03:51.867
Yes, of course,
Olly, you did great.

03:51.933 --> 03:53.267
All right, and if I could
go back to Las Vegas, I would.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.100
But listen, the monotony
of those shows

03:55.167 --> 03:56.333
and the same thing
every night,

03:56.400 --> 03:58.500
it's-- it's crushing
my creative soul.

03:58.567 --> 04:01.200
I get it.
But this is a big deal.

04:01.267 --> 04:02.967
We need to talk
to Danny.

04:03.067 --> 04:06.367
Shouldn't you have
your imaginary assistant
schedule that meeting?

04:06.433 --> 04:09.400
If you're referring to Tajim,
she's on leave.

04:09.467 --> 04:12.300
Maternity leave.
But she sends her love.
Oh.

04:14.067 --> 04:15.600
Okay, 3:00 at Four Arts.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.933
Beautiful, hey, what are
the four arts anyways?

04:18.067 --> 04:20.100
And the fourth art--
singing.

04:20.167 --> 04:22.167
'Cause you can't rep
Sting, Rihanna,

04:22.233 --> 04:23.733
Sia and Miley...

04:23.800 --> 04:25.600
if you aren't gonna
give 'em an art, right?

04:25.667 --> 04:27.167
(chuckles)
That's right.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.333
I remember when
it was just one art.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.367
Stand-up comedy,
it was me

04:30.433 --> 04:32.167
and that prop
comedian Pickles.

04:32.233 --> 04:33.367
Pickles.
(laughing)

04:33.433 --> 04:34.967
I think he's in Branson,
that dude.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.600
(both laughing)

04:36.667 --> 04:37.967
I have George Lucas
for you.

04:38.067 --> 04:40.333
Oh, please, he's gonna bitch
about "Star Wars."

04:40.400 --> 04:43.267
Make a guy a billionaire,
he never forgives you.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.533
I'll return.
I'm with George Lopez.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.900
Don't put anyone through.

04:46.967 --> 04:48.233
Course.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.167
Anyway, George,
so good you're here.

04:51.233 --> 04:53.167
Thanks.
Woodwind & Associates,

04:53.233 --> 04:55.433
they are happy with you.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.667
Hey, next time
I'm in Vegas,

04:57.733 --> 05:00.267
we should play golf
with the CEO, Mr. Hing.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.433
What a great guy.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.833
I mean, it helps
if you speak Mandarin

05:02.900 --> 05:05.867
or you're into prostitutes,
but he is a great guy.

05:05.933 --> 05:07.733
He sounds fun, but here's
the thing, Danny.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.400
George doesn't want
to go back to Vegas.

05:09.467 --> 05:11.233
He wants out of that contract.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.833
(distant phone ringing)

05:12.900 --> 05:14.367
Really, George?

05:15.833 --> 05:16.867
Is it the money?

05:16.933 --> 05:18.067
Because we shook that tree
pretty hard.

05:18.133 --> 05:19.967
No, Danny,
it's not about the money.

05:20.067 --> 05:21.567
I-- I just can't...

05:21.633 --> 05:23.067
I just can't go back
to that same casino

05:23.133 --> 05:24.300
and do the same show.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.567
Danny, I do it
till I'm so numb,

05:25.633 --> 05:26.867
I don't even know
what I'm doing.

05:26.933 --> 05:29.100
Well, of course.
George, what do you want?

05:29.167 --> 05:30.467
Tell me.
That's why I'm here.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.967
Ah, great, well, I have
an idea for a new show.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.133
It's a one-hour.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.633
You know, it's--
it's a one-hour.

05:35.700 --> 05:36.967
It takes place
in the Valley,

05:37.067 --> 05:38.633
like a valley that no one
has ever seen.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.400
Like my side
of the Valley.

05:40.467 --> 05:42.333
I think that sounds
very interesting.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.833
Yeah, and he's an ex-cop
and he's edgy.

05:44.900 --> 05:47.833
It's something completely
unexpected from me.

05:49.133 --> 05:51.800
Wow, well, we have
our marching orders.

05:51.867 --> 05:53.467
We're gonna get you that show,
right, Olly?

05:53.533 --> 05:55.167
Right, 100%.
All you gotta do,

05:55.233 --> 05:56.567
go back to Vegas,
do your show.

05:56.633 --> 05:59.067
While you're doing that,
we'll lay the groundwork

05:59.133 --> 06:02.100
for "Lopez,"
ex-cop show.

06:02.167 --> 06:05.367
Well, here's the thing, Danny,
I'm not going back, okay?

06:05.433 --> 06:06.867
I refuse to go back.

06:06.933 --> 06:10.467
You're just gonna have
to get me out of this contract.

06:10.533 --> 06:12.500
Listen, George,

06:12.567 --> 06:13.800
when we started working
together,

06:13.867 --> 06:15.700
I promised to protect
your interests.

06:15.767 --> 06:18.833
I also knew, sometimes I'd have
to protect you against yourself.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.367
Wait a minute,
from myself?

06:20.433 --> 06:22.100
What-- I'm the problem?

06:22.167 --> 06:23.467
I hope not.

06:23.533 --> 06:24.800
Listen, Danny,
I think this show--

06:24.867 --> 06:26.067
it would be a great
show, it's--

06:26.133 --> 06:27.667
George.
It--

06:27.733 --> 06:29.333
Nobody wants that show
for you.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.333
Well, yeah,
of course not.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.500
Not if they never hear it.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.967
Listen, George,
you won.

06:36.067 --> 06:39.667
That residency show
was your golden handshake.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.800
Your ride into the sunset.

06:41.867 --> 06:45.067
And the money will just
keep rolling in.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.300
Enjoy it.

06:46.367 --> 06:48.067
I don't want to ride
into the sunset, Danny.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.633
I still want to create.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.400
I think this show
can be important.

06:51.467 --> 06:52.733
I think this show can highlight
important issues

06:52.800 --> 06:54.067
in the Latin community.

06:54.133 --> 06:56.467
George, you're talking
about a premium channel

06:56.533 --> 06:58.333
one-hour show.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.167
I can't get you that.

07:00.233 --> 07:01.367
Well, here's the thing.

07:01.433 --> 07:02.533
You don't have
to get it for me.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.933
I'll get it,
I just need you

07:04.067 --> 07:05.500
to get me in the room
and just back me up.

07:05.567 --> 07:08.767
You couldn't get a half-hour
sitcom now, George.

07:08.833 --> 07:13.800
To do that, you have
to be... relevant.

07:15.533 --> 07:19.567
Wow.
Uh, well, relevant, wow.

07:19.633 --> 07:22.367
So you're saying
that I'm irrelevant?

07:22.433 --> 07:26.067
To the studios
and networks, yes.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.067
So what am I supposed to do,
Danny, quit? Disappear?

07:30.100 --> 07:33.200
You're supposed
to go back to Vegas...

07:33.267 --> 07:35.067
and stay there.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.300
(chuckles)

07:38.367 --> 07:39.633
Danny, you're fired.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.800
You're fired.

07:41.867 --> 07:43.100
Yeah.

07:43.167 --> 07:45.733
And (bleep) you too
and your little table.

07:54.233 --> 07:56.167
(Olly)
George?!

07:56.233 --> 07:57.667
George!

07:57.733 --> 08:00.467
Hey, man, could you slow down?
I'm wearing heels.

08:00.533 --> 08:01.967
Listen, I--
I'm sorry,

08:02.067 --> 08:03.833
but I can't work with somebody
who doesn't believe in me.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.367
So you can go back up there

08:05.433 --> 08:06.767
and tell him
I'm not coming back.

08:06.833 --> 08:08.467
Huh, well, I can't work
with Danny either...

08:08.533 --> 08:09.833
because he fired me.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.633
Yeah, it was my job
to keep you in Vegas

08:11.700 --> 08:13.167
and I failed.

08:13.233 --> 08:14.867
I am so screwed.

08:14.933 --> 08:16.967
Do you even know what
the monthly is on my Tesla?

08:17.067 --> 08:19.467
No, but I mean, you don't spend
money on gas or anything.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.300
I don't save quite enough.

08:22.367 --> 08:23.967
Listen, Olly,
I'm truly sorry.

08:24.067 --> 08:25.800
I mean, but when he said
I wasn't relevant,

08:25.867 --> 08:27.067
I mean, what does that
even mean?

08:27.133 --> 08:28.200
Nobody knows.

08:28.267 --> 08:29.467
It's just a word that
people say

08:29.533 --> 08:30.967
now that ratings
are meaningless.

08:31.067 --> 08:32.967
Like nobody watches
"Girls," but it's relevant.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.800
Yeah, why?
I don't know!

08:34.867 --> 08:36.800
Maybe because people
like me can relate to it

08:36.867 --> 08:38.433
and then go to parties
and industry meetings

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
where other people like me
are deciding what's relevant.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.133
God, I hate this business.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.833
And screw this diet.
I'm very hungry.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.867
Do you have any food on you?

08:46.933 --> 08:49.400
No, I--
I just have mints.
Yes.

08:49.467 --> 08:50.733
Want that?
Yeah.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.300
I mean, so listen,
it's just-- it's just that...

08:54.367 --> 08:56.467
What--
what are you...

08:56.533 --> 08:58.167
(sighs)
Yeah, you all right?

08:58.233 --> 09:00.433
You ever wonder why those shows
that are set in Brooklyn

09:00.500 --> 09:01.767
get rave reviews
in pickups?

09:01.833 --> 09:03.467
I never have, but I--

09:03.533 --> 09:04.733
Because executives

09:04.800 --> 09:06.333
and the critics
and the bloggers

09:06.400 --> 09:08.767
live in Brooklyn,
or lived in Brooklyn.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.300
Or wish they lived
in Brooklyn.

09:10.367 --> 09:11.633
So it is relevant to them.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.767
So what do we do?
We move?
Yeah.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.233
To West L.A. at least.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.867
And be white
and snarky

09:16.933 --> 09:18.100
and have dating problems.

09:18.167 --> 09:19.700
Yeah, but that's you,
that's not me.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.267
I grew up poor
in San Fernando.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.067
Yeah, but none of them have
ever been to San Fernando

09:23.133 --> 09:25.133
or care about it
or think it's cool.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.333
But you know what
they do care about?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.400
Anal.
Mm-hmm.

09:29.467 --> 09:30.733
Think about it.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.333
It's like the new
badge of relevance.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.333
Girls, analingus,
high-maintenance.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.467
Gay anal.
All right.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.067
And that's just HBO, folks.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.567
Amazon has "Fleabag,"
the opening scene is anal.

09:39.633 --> 09:40.867
Okay.
Straight anal!

09:40.933 --> 09:42.233
Not so loud, though.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.567
And to prove my point,

09:43.633 --> 09:44.800
those shows are anal Brooklyn,
anal Brooklyn,

09:44.867 --> 09:46.300
anal London.
Hey.

09:46.367 --> 09:48.733
All places that matter
to the people that matter.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.467
All right, I get it.
You know...

09:51.533 --> 09:53.100
I don't fit,
but I never fit in.

09:53.167 --> 09:54.167
But you know what?

09:54.233 --> 09:55.400
I'm gonna attack
this thing head on.

09:55.467 --> 09:57.067
I'm gonna get me another
high-profile manager,

09:57.100 --> 09:58.567
and I'm gonna take you
with me, all right?

09:58.633 --> 10:00.533
And we'll show 'em
what relevance is.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.033
My way, but no anal.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.333
Damn, where's
my parking ticket.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.867
I gotta get Manolo back.
I can't even find my--

10:05.933 --> 10:07.167
Oh, I got him out.

10:07.233 --> 10:08.600
Well, not out.
You gotta go get him.

10:08.667 --> 10:09.900
And his release
is conditional.

10:09.967 --> 10:11.467
You got him out?
Yes.

10:11.533 --> 10:12.767
Oh, my God, Olly,
that's amazing.

10:12.833 --> 10:14.533
Listen, we're gonna
make Danny regret the day

10:14.600 --> 10:16.033
that he lost us both!
Yes!

10:16.100 --> 10:17.467
All right?
(laughs)
Okay.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.167
Should we...?
No.

10:20.233 --> 10:21.467
Okay, I'll call you.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.867
All right, thanks.

10:22.933 --> 10:25.300
Get some food.
(chuckles)

10:25.367 --> 10:27.133
**

10:27.200 --> 10:28.867
(George)
Ah. Ha-ha. Smell that?

10:28.933 --> 10:30.467
(sniffs)
Freedom.

10:30.533 --> 10:31.967
Smell hot dogs.

10:32.033 --> 10:33.167
Hey, you look ripped.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.633
The Armenians thought
I was one of them,

10:34.700 --> 10:36.400
so I got double gym time
in the yard.

10:36.467 --> 10:37.833
Hey, hey,
check this out.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.967
Oh, snap.
Dodgers and Giants.

10:40.033 --> 10:41.367
Man, I missed
every game inside.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.067
All they want to do is
watch "Wendy Williams."

10:43.133 --> 10:44.533
Uh-huh, but look
where it is.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.100
In the dugout club.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.533
Wow, jefe.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.100
I never thought getting out
of jail could be this magical.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.700
All right,
you can let me go, man.

10:54.767 --> 10:57.333
It's like going around
in a full circle, man.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.100
Remember when we were going
to The Comedy Store

10:59.167 --> 11:00.567
when I was 18?

11:00.633 --> 11:02.067
Nobody believed in me.
Everybody made fun of me.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.767
Yeah, and I used to beat
the crap out of 'em.

11:03.833 --> 11:05.167
That's how I feel
right now.

11:05.233 --> 11:06.767
But you know what, Manolo,
I showed 'em then,

11:06.833 --> 11:08.067
and I'm gonna show 'em now.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.367
I think beating the crap
out of people now

11:09.433 --> 11:11.167
might be a violation
of my conditional release.

11:11.233 --> 11:13.133
You don't have to beat
anybody up, bro.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.600
I was talking
metaphorically.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.700
I'm not really sure
what that means,

11:16.767 --> 11:18.400
but maybe after
I get my high school degree.

11:18.467 --> 11:20.400
Ah, I think it's good
you're getting your degree.

11:20.467 --> 11:25.133
Like, what made you have
that, um, epiphany?

11:25.200 --> 11:27.767
Oh, wow.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.967
I really need to learn
some big words.

11:30.067 --> 11:32.133
I have to get my degree as part
of my conditional release.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.700
To prove I am
bettering myself.
Good.

11:33.767 --> 11:34.933
(door creaks open)

11:35.067 --> 11:37.533
There you are,
you son of a bitch!

11:37.600 --> 11:39.233
How do you quit
without telling me?

11:39.300 --> 11:40.833
I didn't find out
till I got to the theater.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.967
I was waiting to go on.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.833
(bleep) you,
George Lopez.

11:49.467 --> 11:51.567
A heads-up to your opener
would've been nice.

11:51.633 --> 11:53.267
You know what, Maronzio,
you're right, I'm sorry, bro.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.633
I had to get outta
there, man.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.200
Man, I loved Vegas!

11:56.267 --> 11:58.700
I mean, I would take
the elevator from my room

11:58.767 --> 12:00.433
down to the casino,
do my show.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.133
I didn't have to worry
about it being fresh.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.667
I would get back up
on the elevator,

12:03.733 --> 12:04.967
go back up to my room.

12:05.067 --> 12:07.333
Sometimes I didn't even
have to go outside.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.733
Quite a life, right?

12:08.800 --> 12:10.233
I get you have to do
what you have to do, George.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.067
But I can't be beholden
to your whims anymore.

12:12.067 --> 12:13.967
His whims means
you're quitting?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.633
No, he quit for me.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.333
And maybe I need to thank you,
George, for this wake-up call.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.700
'Cause I need to find
my own way, a new way.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.800
I've been doing stand-up
for 20 years.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.833
I'm still an opener.
I mean, it's time to move on.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.267
To do what?
Do your stand-up.

12:26.333 --> 12:29.067
Not anymore, I'm gonna
figure out this new media game.

12:29.067 --> 12:30.700
That's where the fans are.

12:30.767 --> 12:32.167
Liked are
the new applause.

12:32.233 --> 12:35.667
YouTube, Snapchat,
it's a gold rush.

12:35.733 --> 12:37.167
It's what's going on,
it's what's happening.

12:37.233 --> 12:39.067
Yeah, it's what's happening
if you're a teenager.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.633
Millennials, and millennials
will love me

12:41.700 --> 12:42.967
'cause I'm very young
on the inside.

12:43.067 --> 12:45.133
I have a crappy apartment,
no car.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.833
Actually, I see myself
as a trans-millennial.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.067
And anything trans
is very hip.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.267
All right, well,
good luck with that.

12:52.333 --> 12:55.233
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go to my trans...

12:55.300 --> 12:57.267
portation, ha.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.367
You know,
some Internet stars,

12:59.433 --> 13:01.500
they only work for like
15 minutes a day.

13:01.567 --> 13:02.600
And they're rich.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.400
Rich?
Yup, that's all I need

13:04.467 --> 13:06.700
is one thing to go viral,
and I'm set.

13:06.767 --> 13:08.600
Yeah, but things don't
just go viral, dude.

13:08.667 --> 13:11.067
See, now that's the old-media
way of thinking, George.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.967
So, jefe, where we going?

13:13.067 --> 13:15.233
Well, Olly thinks
it's more relevant

13:15.300 --> 13:17.700
if I live on the west side.
What?

13:17.767 --> 13:20.067
Yeah, dude,
I don't like the west side.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.133
It's crowded, there's
no good Mexican food.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.367
All those dudes, they look like
they wrote on "The Simpsons,"

13:24.433 --> 13:28.067
curly hair, baseball cap,
white sneakers.
(laughs)

13:28.133 --> 13:30.200
This area right here,
Los Feliz,

13:30.267 --> 13:32.500
I've always liked Los Feliz.
You've got the Observatory.

13:32.567 --> 13:34.067
It's funky,
but not too funky.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.267
Great neighborhood.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.700
Easy drive down
to Dodgers Stadium.

13:36.767 --> 13:38.067
Go Big Blue!

13:38.067 --> 13:39.233
Hey, I just pulled up
this Zillow app

13:39.300 --> 13:40.633
to see what's available.
Oh, no, wait.

13:40.700 --> 13:41.700
Check that place out
right there.

13:41.767 --> 13:42.967
Hey, Manolo, pull over.

13:47.933 --> 13:48.967
Wow.
Hello.

13:49.067 --> 13:50.167
How are you gentlemen
doing today?

13:50.233 --> 13:51.800
Great, I just got
out of jail.

13:51.867 --> 13:53.967
Well, we're doing better now
that we've found this place.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.500
You know what they're
asking for?

13:57.333 --> 13:59.267
You're George Lopez.
You're a celebrity.

13:59.333 --> 14:01.167
And celebrities only rent
when they're in

14:01.233 --> 14:04.133
some difficult transitional
time in their lives.
Damn.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.700
Usually dark and depressing,
involves a lot of damage

14:06.767 --> 14:08.067
to the floors
and plumbing.

14:08.067 --> 14:10.267
I rented to Gary Busey
and Chris Brown,

14:10.333 --> 14:12.467
and I'm not going
through that again.

14:12.533 --> 14:13.700
The TMZ buses alone--

14:13.767 --> 14:15.167
I'm just looking
for a peaceful place.

14:15.233 --> 14:17.800
My daughter is away
in a gap year in Cuba.

14:17.867 --> 14:19.167
This place is
way too big for you.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.667
No, I like big places.

14:20.733 --> 14:22.867
And I need enough room for
when my daughter comes back.

14:22.933 --> 14:24.233
And I'm gonna tell you
right now,

14:24.300 --> 14:25.600
you have nothing
to worry about with me.

14:25.667 --> 14:26.767
He's very responsible.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.100
Yells at me
all the time

14:28.167 --> 14:29.500
for not cleaning up
after myself.

14:29.567 --> 14:30.600
Yeah, shut up.
You see?

14:30.667 --> 14:31.667
I want this place.

14:31.733 --> 14:32.867
But you haven't
even seen it.

14:32.933 --> 14:34.067
I seen enough.
I like what I see.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.267
I'll tell you
what I'll do,

14:35.333 --> 14:36.867
I'll give you
a full year's rent

14:36.933 --> 14:38.833
and I'll double whatever
the security deposit is.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.200
Done.

14:40.267 --> 14:43.067
I'll go get
the paperwork.
Ha-ha.

14:44.733 --> 14:47.600
You're gonna look good holding
that lamp outside here.

14:49.700 --> 14:52.467
So, Manolo Rodriguez.

14:52.533 --> 14:54.967
Figures.

14:55.067 --> 14:57.067
Anyway, congratulations

14:57.067 --> 14:58.567
in starting
the exciting journey

14:58.633 --> 15:00.733
to getting your general
equivalency degree.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.100
Thank you, sir.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.367
So I'm supposed to tell you
that, with your GED,

15:06.433 --> 15:08.233
you can do anything
your heart desires.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.167
So I could be an astronaut
or a fireman?

15:10.233 --> 15:12.500
Are you six?
No.

15:12.567 --> 15:15.667
Here's some info
on refrigerator repair

15:15.733 --> 15:20.067
and data entry, if your dreams
take you in that direction.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.067
Are you high?

15:25.100 --> 15:26.433
A little.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.900
**

15:29.967 --> 15:31.067
Oh, shit.

15:31.067 --> 15:34.067
Let's go.
Let's go.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.333
Let's go, go, go.
Hey.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.700
(car door indicator beeping)

15:38.767 --> 15:39.767
Where we going, jefe?

15:39.833 --> 15:40.833
Shelter Management called.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.233
They said they want
to sign me.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.467
(laughs)

15:44.533 --> 15:46.167
(George)
Hey.

15:46.233 --> 15:48.067
Hey, jefe, you were
in there a long time.

15:48.067 --> 15:49.367
Hey, yeah, well,
it took a while

15:49.433 --> 15:51.567
to drink that
Napoleon brandy, man,

15:51.633 --> 15:53.167
and smoke fine cigars.

15:53.233 --> 15:55.200
Hey, and to get 'em to approve
everything I wanted,

15:55.267 --> 15:57.667
including hiring Olly.
That's tight.

15:57.733 --> 15:58.900
Dude, she gonna go nuts.

15:58.967 --> 16:00.300
Ay, we should tell her
in person.

16:00.367 --> 16:02.233
Wait a minute,
I know where she lives.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.767
Oh, wait, I got it.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.267
I remember Tajim had me
send some packages to her.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.400
Look, she's not that far.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.400
Oh, yeah,
let's go tell her.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.733
Ay, oh, by the way,
Taji--

16:10.800 --> 16:12.667
Nah, never--
never mind.

16:12.733 --> 16:14.433
Come on, let's go.
(chuckles)

16:14.500 --> 16:18.100
(George)
Hey, man, being a manager
must pay pretty good.

16:19.733 --> 16:21.100
Maybe too good.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.733
Olly!
Olly!

16:29.067 --> 16:30.600
Olly, your friends are here.

16:33.500 --> 16:34.600
Great.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.800
(chuckling)
Oh, uh, nice hair.

16:39.867 --> 16:41.100
It was high school,

16:41.167 --> 16:43.233
a very traumatic
and unrelenting high school.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.333
How about that one?
Princeton.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.967
And that one?
Law school, USC.

16:48.067 --> 16:50.533
You graduated
from law school?
Mm-hmm.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.133
How old are you?
27.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.500
Damn, I really do need
to get my GED.

16:54.567 --> 16:56.300
So, listen, Olly,
I'm thinking about signing

16:56.367 --> 16:58.233
with Len Soris over there
at Shelter Management.

16:58.300 --> 17:01.133
He's gonna do everything I want
including hiring you!

17:01.200 --> 17:03.667
(gasps)
I think I'll pass.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.267
You're turning down
Shelter Management?

17:10.333 --> 17:12.500
Yes, and I think
you should, too.

17:12.567 --> 17:15.367
That I should turn down the most
powerful manager in Hollywood

17:15.433 --> 17:17.500
who promised to do
everything I asked him to do,

17:17.567 --> 17:19.500
and he said that the hour-long
show's a slam dunk.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.533
And he pointed out that
it'll take a little while

17:21.600 --> 17:23.267
to lay the groundwork
for the show,

17:23.333 --> 17:25.100
so you might as well
make a trip back to Vegas,

17:25.167 --> 17:26.800
patch things up?
No, you know what?

17:26.867 --> 17:28.267
He's not shipping me
back to Vegas.

17:28.333 --> 17:29.600
He just wants me
to go back there

17:29.667 --> 17:31.200
to smooth things over
with the brass

17:31.267 --> 17:32.800
and maybe hang out
with Mr. Hing.
Mmm.

17:32.867 --> 17:35.300
Maybe just do a show or two
just to show good faith?

17:35.367 --> 17:37.633
How'd you know that?

17:37.700 --> 17:39.533
Because I'm a manager.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.533
Len is no worse
and no better than Danny.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.867
They just see a little
money-producing box

17:43.933 --> 17:45.367
and they want
to keep you in it.

17:45.433 --> 17:48.433
George, there will always be
another reason

17:48.500 --> 17:50.200
why you should just
go back to Vegas

17:50.267 --> 17:51.600
and do a couple more shows.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.800
And there will never be
any groundwork laid

17:53.867 --> 17:54.867
for your new TV show.

17:54.933 --> 17:57.433
They are all
the same.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.800
And I'm not going
back to it.

17:59.867 --> 18:01.700
It makes you inhuman.

18:02.933 --> 18:04.167
What are you gonna do?

18:04.233 --> 18:05.933
I've been thinking
a lot about this.

18:06.067 --> 18:08.133
I am going to be
a "magent."

18:09.267 --> 18:10.333
What the hell--

18:10.400 --> 18:12.167
You know how an agent
takes 10%

18:12.233 --> 18:13.567
and a manager takes 10%.

18:13.633 --> 18:16.067
Well, I'm going
to do it all.

18:16.067 --> 18:17.867
For 10%?
I was thinking 15.

18:17.933 --> 18:19.267
But whatever you want.
Me?

18:19.333 --> 18:20.500
I know what
you're thinking.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.200
I don't know if she
can do the job.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.633
Well, guess what? I don't
know if I can do the job.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.700
Wow, that's quite
a sales pitch you have.

18:26.767 --> 18:28.067
George, if you go back

18:28.100 --> 18:30.067
with a big, powerful
management company,

18:30.067 --> 18:31.533
you will end up
in the same place.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.733
Only then, you'll be
creatively finished.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.233
You need someone like me,

18:36.300 --> 18:38.333
someone who cares
only about you

18:38.400 --> 18:39.500
and who has something
to prove to you

18:39.567 --> 18:42.633
and to this town
and to her high school

18:42.700 --> 18:44.067
and to herself.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.833
(knocking on door)

18:47.467 --> 18:49.933
Olly, would you and your friends
like some soup?

18:50.067 --> 18:51.667
I can make it in the Keurig.

18:51.733 --> 18:54.533
It comes in pods like coffee
but tastes like soup.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.067
No thanks, Mom.
I'm closing a deal.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.567
Okay.

18:58.633 --> 19:01.233
(door closes)

19:01.300 --> 19:03.400
Oh, well...

19:03.467 --> 19:05.833
guess we all have something
to prove.

19:13.067 --> 19:14.100
I feel sick.

19:14.167 --> 19:15.400
Mom! Tums!

19:15.467 --> 19:16.900
Do you have an antacid?

19:16.967 --> 19:18.767
And champagne.

19:20.933 --> 19:23.667
The good part is Olly's hungry
so she's motivated

19:23.733 --> 19:25.367
to get this hour-long show
to work.

19:25.433 --> 19:27.900
I'm gonna miss those bubbly
fruit waters at Four Arts.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.300
(doorbell ringing)
(laughs)

19:29.367 --> 19:31.133
I'll get you
a gift certificate to BevMo!

19:31.200 --> 19:32.667
(doorbell continues ringing)

19:34.333 --> 19:36.133
Oh, man!
He wasn't lying.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.667
You are George Lopez!

19:37.733 --> 19:40.167
I'm Hector, Manolo's roommate
from jail.

19:40.233 --> 19:42.067
Yo, what's up, big guy?

19:42.133 --> 19:43.333
Hey, what's up?
What's up, man?

19:43.400 --> 19:45.100
What's up, boss?

19:45.167 --> 19:47.867
Oh, man,
this is great.

19:47.933 --> 19:50.400
Oh, and thanks for letting me
use your Uber account.

19:50.467 --> 19:53.400
I usually have to take
the bus when I get out of jail.

19:53.467 --> 19:54.433
(gags)
Oh...

19:54.500 --> 19:55.767
Oh, this is good.

19:55.833 --> 19:57.300
Ah.

19:58.867 --> 20:00.967
* Uh, yeah, yeah *

20:01.033 --> 20:03.067
* That's right
come on, come on, come on *

20:03.133 --> 20:05.567
* Uh, yeah, yeah *

20:05.633 --> 20:07.667
* Come on
come on *

20:07.733 --> 20:10.633
**

20:15.967 --> 20:18.267
* Get your hands up
get your hands up *

20:18.333 --> 20:20.300
* Get your hands up
get your hands up *

20:20.367 --> 20:22.467
* Get your hands up
get your hands up *

20:22.533 --> 20:25.633
* Oh, oh, oh, oh... **
