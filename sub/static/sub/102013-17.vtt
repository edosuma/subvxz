is how you killed Celia

What?

00:37.472 --> 00:39.256
Was I not
loud enough?

00:39.300 --> 00:42.477
You murdered her.

This guy. I told you,

my dad's been telling
anyone who'll listen

01:18.948 --> 01:21.907
about his Black Crown tape?Gil, I have it covered.

01:21.951 --> 01:25.302
Just had a thought
over here, kids.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.609
I don't believe
a word you said.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.306
Celia's dead?

01:29.350 --> 01:30.916
Prove it.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.311
Gil, give me your phone.

01:35.573 --> 01:37.358
This is a photo

from the crime scene.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.928
Do you believe me now?

01:43.929 --> 01:46.062
She's dead,

01:46.106 --> 01:47.629
and I'm going to bring you
to justice

finally breathe again.

Nancy didn't

But if I'm Nancy, I have to
wonder if Everett learned

03:04.662 --> 03:07.274
Celia was keeping his secret
granddaughter from him...

03:07.317 --> 03:09.624
And then murdered Celia
in a fit of rage.

Nancy goes off the grid.

I wasn't scrapbooking and
it's not calming me down.

Maybe you should leave

You murdered your
own accountant

It is, however, going

06:37.484 --> 06:38.746

law enforcement agencies

06:38.789 --> 06:40.356
to give them a running start,

who you paid to kill Celia

to that one already, don't we?

More dime-store fiction

daughter a secret?

You can stop acting like
there's any reasonable doubt,

07:01.246 --> 07:03.901
because there is no doubt here,
there is only the truth.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.425
The truth

07:05.468 --> 07:07.818
is that I had no idea
you were my grandchild

07:07.862 --> 07:10.473
until you told me.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.997
And I didn't kill my wife.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.565
Why do you seem more upset
over an accusation

07:15.609 --> 07:18.046
than you do
about your own wife's death?

07:18.089 --> 07:22.485
Maybe because you seem
upset enough for both of us.

07:22.529 --> 07:25.314
Which is strange.

07:25.357 --> 07:28.970
How well did you
actually know Celia?

Well enough.Ah.

07:32.539 --> 07:36.064
Well, you certainly
sought her out, didn't you?

07:38.066 --> 07:41.025
How did you gain her sympathy?

07:41.069 --> 07:43.201
Did you play on her weakness

07:43.245 --> 07:47.467
for anything connected
to her darling son?

07:47.510 --> 07:51.209
Or were you using the
mother-sized hole in your life

07:51.253 --> 07:53.647
to emotionally
manipulate her?

07:53.690 --> 07:55.649
Or was it both?

07:56.650 --> 07:59.087
If you agree, say nothing.

You used Lucy Sable's

talk to him.

need to listen to this.

Based on Nancy's
appearance and bruises,

of living hex or curse.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.497
Do you have any more photos
of her looking like this?

11:12.541 --> 11:14.717

review for economic hardship

in the mail. Look,
I-I promise you,

Oh. Then what is it?

really like to pay it forward

Do we really
know these kids?

12:09.685 --> 12:11.469
Well, you know me.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.950
Right?
I-I was one of these kids

that could now use my
help who just need a...

12:15.822 --> 12:18.738
They just need a second chance
to make a life for themselves.

12:18.781 --> 12:22.611
You were able to move on
and-and start a life in a...

12:22.654 --> 12:25.048
a good, traditional town.

12:25.092 --> 12:28.573
I want to keep this town
good and...

12:28.617 --> 12:29.923
traditional.

12:29.966 --> 12:31.881
It's not you
I have a problem with, Nick.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.013
You're one of the good ones.

12:34.623 --> 12:37.800
Right. Okay.
One of the good ones?Um...

12:37.844 --> 12:41.412
I just... I don't want
my customers to feel...

12:41.456 --> 12:43.066
uncomfortable.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.938
You understand.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.591
Uh, no.

12:46.635 --> 12:47.854
No. No.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.899
[chuckles]:
No, I don't.

12:49.943 --> 12:52.075
Because, uh,
youth center or not,

12:52.119 --> 12:53.511
there's still gonna be kids
in our community

12:53.555 --> 12:54.991
who need a place to go.

12:55.035 --> 12:57.733
You know, we-we can make
a difference with-with outreach,

12:57.777 --> 12:59.822
like-like Old Navy's
This Way ONward job program.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.737
We can mentor them
and give them life skills

13:01.781 --> 13:04.392
that you and I,
we take for granted.

13:04.435 --> 13:07.047
Yeah.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.353
All right, should
we just do nothing?

13:09.397 --> 13:12.487
Huh?
Wait for them to screw up?

13:13.488 --> 13:15.272
You're right.

13:15.316 --> 13:17.797
You're right.
I get it.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.191
Tell you what. How about
I donate to your youth center?

13:21.235 --> 13:23.280
That would be amazing.

13:23.324 --> 13:24.934
As long as it's not
in this town.

Okay.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.161
Honestly, Nick, you can
prove it to me up and down.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.902
You're never
gonna change my mind.

13:35.945 --> 13:39.644
They can get help
someplace else. Just...

Hey, Jimmy.

What are you up to?

14:08.282 --> 14:10.545
This is your hit man account,
Everett.

14:10.588 --> 14:13.940
Where is the money,
you psychopath?

14:20.990 --> 14:23.906
That can't be right.

14:27.388 --> 14:28.998
GIL:
Don't overdo it.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.826
It's tough to pee
without your hands,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.655
and that part of the gig,
I did not sign up for.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.094
Thank you.

14:40.444 --> 14:44.057
And I hope you didn't take
my earlier outburst to heart.

14:44.100 --> 14:48.061
My mind
is not the clearest.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.369
But what I do know

14:52.413 --> 14:54.806
is that you
are your father's son,

14:54.850 --> 14:57.897
and Bertram
is a truly stand-up guy.

14:57.940 --> 15:01.683
You know,
he never once asked me

15:01.726 --> 15:03.859
to use my influence
to get him out of prison,

15:03.903 --> 15:06.731
which is a shame.

15:06.775 --> 15:10.170
Because I do have influence.

15:10.213 --> 15:15.305
A man like me
could get your father released.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.264
And then what?

15:17.307 --> 15:18.613
Hmm?

15:18.656 --> 15:19.831
You're gonna kill him

15:19.875 --> 15:21.007
the same way
you killed your accountant?

15:23.009 --> 15:25.533
You know, it seems like

15:25.576 --> 15:28.188
the best thing
for my father...

15:30.146 --> 15:31.408
...is for you to just disappear.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.801
Is it?

15:32.844 --> 15:34.411
Or would it be better for him

15:34.455 --> 15:36.587
if I provided the means
for you and your sister

15:36.631 --> 15:40.417
to get out of that trailer park
and start a new life?

15:40.461 --> 15:44.117
I don't want your father dead.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.771
I want him quiet.

15:46.815 --> 15:50.862
And his long-term happiness
achieves that as well.

15:54.388 --> 15:58.348
With a significant upside
for you.

16:08.837 --> 16:11.405
How much money?

16:11.448 --> 16:13.929
Give me a number.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.410
Connor, it's Tamura.
Do we have a time of death

16:16.453 --> 16:18.281
for Celia Hudson yet?CONNOR: We do.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.891
Mm, looks like her body
was discovered

16:19.935 --> 16:22.372
22 hours postmortem.
Give or take.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.070
22 hours.

16:24.113 --> 16:26.768
So she was killed long before
guests would have used

16:26.811 --> 16:28.726
the yacht club parking lot
for Everett's party.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.511
Yeah, judging by the state

he told you...It's not what it looks like.

You killed her!

What are you...
[grunting]

17:16.122 --> 17:18.472
NANCY:I'm sorry, Ryan. I
know that Celia was...

17:18.515 --> 17:20.561
RYAN:I don't want to
think about her.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.523
I want to think about him.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.177
How did you find us?

17:28.221 --> 17:30.005
Tamura told me.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.225
His limo was last seen
on the west side,

17:32.268 --> 17:35.054
and what other connection
does he have to the west side

17:35.097 --> 17:37.360
but Lucy Sable?
Don't-don't panic.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.579
Okay?
I figured it out first.

17:38.622 --> 17:41.408
Tamura doesn't know
about the history.

17:41.451 --> 17:44.498
We got some time
till he catches up.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.110
So, what's the plan?

17:48.154 --> 17:49.720
Get Everett to confess.

17:49.764 --> 17:52.332
I went looking for proof.
I have Howard's laptop.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.899
Okay.
So, w-we need to access

17:54.943 --> 17:57.076
whatever accounts
he had put in my name,

17:57.119 --> 17:58.555
and then we need
to trace the money

17:58.599 --> 17:59.861
to whatever hit man he...Right,

17:59.904 --> 18:01.819
but there are no
recent payments.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.952
What do you mean,
there's no recent payments?

18:03.995 --> 18:07.695
It-it doesn't clear him, still.
It doesn't.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.349
M-Maybe he
hasn't paid yet.

18:09.392 --> 18:12.830
Right. 'Cause you know hit men
who work on spec.

18:12.874 --> 18:16.138
Or maybe he didn't use your
account for payment this time.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.705
Or he paid in cash.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.489
There has to be
a money trail.

18:19.533 --> 18:22.884
Unless Everett
murdered Celia himself,

18:22.927 --> 18:25.147
but that's not
his usual M.O.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.670
No.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.237
Was there anything

18:28.281 --> 18:29.847
o-on the computer?
A-Any clues?

18:29.891 --> 18:31.762
NANCY:Nothing that'll
take Everett down.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.851
What are you not saying?

18:35.853 --> 18:38.943
I read
Everett and Celia's prenup.

18:38.987 --> 18:42.643
He forfeits any right
to Celia's family's estate

18:42.686 --> 18:43.948
if she's ever murdered.

18:44.949 --> 18:47.169
RYAN:
Okay, but...

18:47.213 --> 18:49.084
if he had her murdered,

18:49.128 --> 18:50.651
he'd make it look like
an accident.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.696
NANCY: I know.Right? Just like he did
with-with Howard,

18:52.740 --> 18:54.872
with all the murders
that he's involved in.

18:54.916 --> 18:57.353
Look, he doesn't
inherit anything

18:57.397 --> 18:59.355
if she's murdered, right?

18:59.399 --> 19:01.401
Why would he pass
on a fortune?

19:01.444 --> 19:03.403
It just...
It just doesn't add up.Well,

19:03.446 --> 19:05.622
it will. I just need
a little more time.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.755
GIL:
No, it won't.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.800
I should've let him go
when I had the chance.

19:09.844 --> 19:12.760
Do you really think
that Everett was gonna pay you?

19:12.803 --> 19:15.328
You really think he would
fold up and confess? Huh?

19:15.371 --> 19:16.851
[scoffs]
That was a stupid plan.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.766
Hey, back off, okay?NANCY: It was a plan

19:18.809 --> 19:20.594
you agreed to.Yes, because you said

19:20.637 --> 19:22.987
you could protect my dad
by bringing Everett to justice.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.772
But now you're wrong
about Everett

19:24.815 --> 19:26.426
and I get to end up
in prison for kidnapping.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.515
He killed Celia.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.604
I will find the evidence.

19:30.647 --> 19:32.171
Trust me.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.216
You won't.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.915
Because it doesn't exist.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.790
And even you
are starting to believe me,

19:42.833 --> 19:45.009
aren't you?

19:52.278 --> 19:54.018
Can I ask you

19:54.062 --> 19:55.498
a non-Nancy-curse-related
question?

19:55.542 --> 19:57.108
Sure.Okay.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.458
So, I have this friend

19:58.501 --> 20:00.938
who is hosting
the spirit of a dead lady.

20:00.982 --> 20:03.027
Go on.We were recently told

20:03.071 --> 20:04.899
that my friend's life line

20:04.942 --> 20:06.857
is now merging
with this woman's.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.077
Um, Nodette.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.559
Problem is Nodette's life line
was violent and short,

20:12.602 --> 20:13.995
and my friend was told

20:14.038 --> 20:16.171
that if she doesn't sever
the connection between them,

20:16.215 --> 20:17.868
her life line

20:17.912 --> 20:20.001
will also be shortened.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.090
But that-that's crazy.

20:22.133 --> 20:24.658
Right?How old was Nodette
when she died?

20:24.701 --> 20:26.921
22.Well,

20:26.964 --> 20:29.010
when two souls are intertwined,

20:29.053 --> 20:33.014
the average is weighted
towards the spirit.

20:33.057 --> 20:37.845
So your friend probably has
no more than a decade left.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.760
I'm sorry, George.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.029
Detective Tamura,

20:48.072 --> 20:50.727
could I borrow
you for a second?

20:50.771 --> 20:53.208
Yeah. I could
actually use your help.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.166
You're a car guy, right?

20:55.210 --> 20:57.560
Do you know what kind of car
this taillight might belong to?

20:57.604 --> 20:59.040
Oh.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.911
Oh, yeah, that's def...

21:04.437 --> 21:07.048
Definitely
a really common taillight

21:07.091 --> 21:09.311
that, um, is easily confused

21:09.355 --> 21:11.879
with taillights from...

21:11.922 --> 21:13.881
any number of cars.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.578
Or boats.

21:17.014 --> 21:20.670
Got it.
Oh, well.

21:20.714 --> 21:23.760
Thought I'd take a shot,
you know? Have a seat.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.335
So you needed something?
Is it urgent?

21:33.379 --> 21:37.208
Uh... yeah.

21:37.252 --> 21:41.343
Yeah, it is.
Um...

21:41.387 --> 21:43.780
how serious were you
when you said you wanted

21:43.824 --> 21:45.869
to help reform
this police department?

21:46.914 --> 21:49.873
I'm having an issue
with a tenant.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.835
Look, you keep
bringing up Everett,

21:54.878 --> 21:56.967
but maybe someone else
wanted her dead.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.143
No offense.

21:59.187 --> 22:01.145
No offense taken.
It's the truth.

22:01.189 --> 22:03.931
Celia didn't have enemies.
She had garden parties.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.454
NANCY:Exactly.

22:05.498 --> 22:09.458
And this killing
was cold and vindictive.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.505
Even ritualistic.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.595
Somebody was sending a message.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.423
And the way
that her body was posed--

22:17.466 --> 22:20.251
I've-I've seen... I've seen
something like that before.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.387
Her body was posed like Icarus.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.304
Uh, what now?

22:29.348 --> 22:30.958
Greek mythology.

22:31.001 --> 22:33.003
Guy who put on wings,
he flew too close to the sun,

22:33.047 --> 22:35.919
you know...EVERETT: He reached too far,
paid the price,

22:35.963 --> 22:38.444
fell to his death.

22:38.487 --> 22:39.967
So what are you saying?

22:40.010 --> 22:42.970
You saying that Celia
paid a price for something?

22:43.013 --> 22:45.538
Yesterday, Celia was obsessing
over this list.

22:45.581 --> 22:49.237
Oh, God. I made such a mistake
with the list.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.155
I thought it was the...

22:54.198 --> 22:57.288
I thought it was the guest list
for Everett's party,

22:57.332 --> 22:59.421
but what if the...

22:59.465 --> 23:01.467
What if it was the list of names
she got for me?

23:01.510 --> 23:03.860
ACE:
You got the list back
from Celia?

23:07.081 --> 23:08.517
What-what list?
What names?

23:08.561 --> 23:10.780
Celia did something
risky for me.

23:10.824 --> 23:13.479
There was this list
of witnesses.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.176
Whistleblowers.

23:15.219 --> 23:17.178
I couldn't let it
get in the wrong hands.

23:17.221 --> 23:18.701
EVERETT:
Whose hands?

23:18.745 --> 23:21.661
This secret organization
called The Road Back.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.750
Celia...

23:23.793 --> 23:26.230
went up against
The Road Back?

23:28.494 --> 23:31.322
Who are they?A powerful group

23:31.366 --> 23:34.717
with infinite means
and unflagging resolve.

23:36.284 --> 23:39.548
The general public
have no idea they even exist.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.117
A scarce few know
that they're out there.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.686
But The Road Back wouldn't
hesitate to make an example

23:46.729 --> 23:49.036
of anyone who angered them.

23:49.079 --> 23:51.560
And they'd be very clear

23:51.604 --> 23:54.084
that they were the ones
who were angry.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.522
If it was them, they would have
left an actual calling card,

23:56.565 --> 23:59.089
as well-- their marker.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.569
RYAN:
Like a symbol?

24:02.963 --> 24:05.269
Look. Police
left this for me.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.488
It's Celia's stuff.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.229
I thought it was
weird that she was

24:08.272 --> 24:09.926
carrying around pocket change,
but then I saw the symbol,

24:09.970 --> 24:11.319
and I didn't know
what it was.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.106
That's the symbol
for The Road Back.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.633
So it wasn't Everett.

24:20.676 --> 24:22.722
EVERETT:
Surprise.

24:22.765 --> 24:25.507
But guess what.

24:25.551 --> 24:28.423
The person responsible is here.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.165
Because if Celia hadn't
helped Nancy with that list,

24:31.208 --> 24:34.908
she wouldn't have earned
retribution from The Road Back.

24:34.951 --> 24:38.999
Your grandmother
was brutally murdered

24:39.042 --> 24:42.481
to send a message to you.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.412
Hey.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.414
I got Celia killed.

25:03.458 --> 25:06.330
No. No, you didn't.Mm-hmm.

25:06.374 --> 25:09.333
She was doing
a favor for me.A favor?

25:09.377 --> 25:12.075
[scoffs] You were doing this
to save Ace's life.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.424
She was doing this

25:13.468 --> 25:14.991
to keep her son of a bitch
husband out of jail.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.732
That's how she did business.

25:16.776 --> 25:18.560
If I had known then,
Ryan, I would have...

25:18.604 --> 25:21.607
How could you have known what
The Road Back was capable of?

25:21.650 --> 25:22.999
You couldn't.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.045
She did.

25:25.088 --> 25:27.526
And those were the choices
that she made.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.833
How do I get justice for her?

25:30.877 --> 25:32.879
Maybe you don't.

25:32.922 --> 25:36.317
Maybe you just
add it to the list,

25:36.360 --> 25:39.189
and you focus on what you came
to get justice for.

25:39.233 --> 25:40.843
For Everett?Yeah.

25:40.887 --> 25:43.324
I was wrong about him.No, you weren't wrong.

25:43.367 --> 25:46.588
Nancy, don't forget
who my father is.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.764
You tied up the right guy.

25:48.808 --> 25:51.854
You just tied him up
for the wrong murder.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.512
Hey, Jake.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.340
Hey, Nick.

25:59.383 --> 26:00.950
Glad I caught you.

26:00.994 --> 26:03.213
I just, uh...

26:03.257 --> 26:05.825
I wanted to thank you
for helping me understand

26:05.868 --> 26:08.479
the real reason
behind your complaint.

26:08.523 --> 26:10.177
Aw, don't worry about it.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.440
You got a good heart.Yup.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.834
But I lost focus,

26:14.877 --> 26:16.400
and I made the mistake

26:16.444 --> 26:17.967
of thinking my goal

26:18.011 --> 26:20.491
was to change
your small mind.

26:22.276 --> 26:23.582
Excuse me?See...

26:25.018 --> 26:26.106
I always think that

26:26.149 --> 26:27.760
I have to go through
people like you,

26:27.803 --> 26:29.762
like I've had to do before.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.938
Like those who came
before me have had to do

26:31.981 --> 26:34.984
because they had
no other choice.

26:35.028 --> 26:38.031
But I have the means
and the privilege

26:38.074 --> 26:40.773
to do things that they couldn't.

26:40.816 --> 26:43.340
Like find a way around you.Okay.

26:43.384 --> 26:46.039
I, uh, see what
you're doing here.

26:46.082 --> 26:47.431
You're trying to make me
the bad guy, and I...

26:47.475 --> 26:49.564
No, no, no, no,
no. No. No.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.610
You are the bad guy.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.046
But that's beside my point.

26:53.089 --> 26:55.222
What I'm trying to get you
to see is that building

26:55.265 --> 26:57.354
across the street there,
because

26:57.398 --> 27:01.097
I just bought it
for my youth center.

27:04.405 --> 27:07.669
I'm rich, Jake.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.715
Very rich.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.847
And according to
the zoning committee,

27:11.891 --> 27:14.371
because the youth center's
gonna be more than 50 feet

27:14.415 --> 27:17.200
away from your café,

27:17.244 --> 27:19.115
you have no say

27:19.159 --> 27:22.292
if, when or how it gets built.

27:24.773 --> 27:27.123
You know, I, uh,

27:27.167 --> 27:30.431
just want to keep

27:30.474 --> 27:34.783
this neighborhood safe.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.611
Then you'll be happy
to know I partnered

27:36.655 --> 27:38.657
with Horseshoe Bay PD.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.746
And they are also committed

27:40.789 --> 27:42.791
to reinvesting
in at-risk kids.

27:42.835 --> 27:45.707
Was setting up your center
in the next town over

27:45.751 --> 27:48.275
really that big of a deal?

27:48.318 --> 27:52.366
Allowing kids to thrive
in their own community...

27:52.409 --> 27:55.021
is a big deal.

27:55.064 --> 27:58.241
Letting them know that
they belong here...

27:58.285 --> 28:01.027
is a big deal.

28:01.070 --> 28:04.944
And setting up a rival café
in my new building...

28:04.987 --> 28:06.641
[exhales]

28:06.685 --> 28:08.469
...that's gonna be a huge deal.

28:10.906 --> 28:14.693
So, good luck, Jake.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.962
So this Road Back--

28:23.005 --> 28:25.225
what are you gonna do about
them killing your wife?

28:25.268 --> 28:28.750
I mean, you're a powerful man.

28:30.926 --> 28:32.841
How do you think
you survive long enough

28:32.885 --> 28:35.714
to become a powerful man?

28:35.757 --> 28:38.760
Banish emotion,
pick your fights.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.676
Understand when
you have leverage

28:41.720 --> 28:43.939
and when you're outmatched.[door opens]

28:43.983 --> 28:46.768
I'm so sorry, Gil,
for bringing you into this.

28:46.812 --> 28:47.900
I messed it all up.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.163
Are we about done?

28:50.206 --> 28:51.773
My hands are beginning to numb.

28:51.817 --> 28:55.734
[phone vibrating]

28:55.777 --> 28:57.518
RYAN:
It's our favorite detective.

28:57.561 --> 28:58.737
NANCY:We need to know
what they know.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.521
Answer it, but don't
give anything away.

29:00.564 --> 29:01.914
Yeah.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.481
Oh, is this really
necessary?

29:09.617 --> 29:11.793
Hey, Detective.
You got any news?

29:11.837 --> 29:13.752
It's a long shot,
but I found a broken taillight

29:13.795 --> 29:14.796
by the yacht club.

29:14.840 --> 29:15.884
I believe it's from a car

29:15.928 --> 29:17.190
that belongs to Nancy Drew.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.757
Know anything about that?

29:18.800 --> 29:21.760
Uh, no. No, I don't.
I-I'm sorry.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.806
Hmm. Any chance
you've seen Nancy today?

29:24.850 --> 29:26.808
No, no. Have not...

29:26.852 --> 29:28.505
have not seen her today, no.

29:28.549 --> 29:30.246
Right.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.032
Put Nancy on.

29:34.903 --> 29:37.210
Detective, you seem very
concerned about my brake lights.

29:37.253 --> 29:39.473
I appreciate it,
but they are fine.

29:39.516 --> 29:40.866
When did you and Ryan
get so close?

29:40.909 --> 29:42.650
That's a weird question.
What, do you want in

29:42.693 --> 29:44.043
on our book club or something?

29:44.086 --> 29:45.740
Well, I'm curious,
since you're the one

29:45.784 --> 29:47.220
who got his father
arrested for murder,

29:47.263 --> 29:49.048
and then abruptly
recanted your testimony,

29:49.091 --> 29:50.701
which seemed kind of coerced.

29:50.745 --> 29:53.226
And you had to know it would
spring Everett from jail,

29:53.269 --> 29:55.489
and now he's the prime suspect
in his wife's murder.

29:55.532 --> 29:57.621
Sorry, you're-you're
kind of breaking up.

29:57.665 --> 30:00.668
Hey, Nancy...

30:00.711 --> 30:01.930
put Everett on.

30:04.454 --> 30:07.240
Plan C.Okay. What's Plan C?

30:09.416 --> 30:10.939
Gil and I agreed that
if Everett didn't

30:10.983 --> 30:11.984
walk out of here
in handcuffs,

30:12.027 --> 30:14.029
he didn't
walk out of here.

30:14.073 --> 30:16.466
Wh... You...

30:16.510 --> 30:17.685
you can't be serious.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.556
It was an idea, okay?
We never...

30:19.600 --> 30:20.644
You said it
yourself, Ryan.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.342
He's a murderer.

30:22.385 --> 30:24.866
Not Celia's,
but he killed someone

30:24.910 --> 30:26.912
on that Black Crown tape.Okay, but come on...

30:26.955 --> 30:28.435
Imagine your life
without your father.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.872
No one else
ever gets hurt or killed

30:30.916 --> 30:32.352
because of him again.

30:33.657 --> 30:35.616
Can I just...
can I talk to you

30:35.659 --> 30:37.357
in private, please?

30:37.400 --> 30:38.967
[sighs]

30:40.490 --> 30:42.275
You know that
I am right--

30:42.318 --> 30:43.276
it's obvious
what needs to be done.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.931
Does your offer still stand?

30:45.974 --> 30:47.106
You know, now that
your granddaughter

30:47.149 --> 30:48.977
is about to
convince your son

30:49.021 --> 30:51.066
to get rid of you,NANCY: The sooner we get this
over with, the better.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.807
I'm thinking I have leverage.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.635
NANCY:Like you said, we didn't
tie up the wrong guy.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.289
Yeah, I said that because
I thought you were trying

30:56.332 --> 30:58.682
to get a confession,
not trying to kill him.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.075
[door shuts]

31:17.658 --> 31:20.791
They're not bruises.
They're claw marks.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.619
Look. I think
this is the same thing

31:22.663 --> 31:23.838
that's happening to Nancy.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.536
Parasitic Entities?
Oh, fantastic.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.844
She has a supernatural
parasite attached to her.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.325
An entity feeding
off of her life force.

31:32.368 --> 31:34.022
If it's already
this bad...

31:34.066 --> 31:37.504
Then Nancy only has
a few days to live.

31:37.547 --> 31:38.505
What? No.

31:38.548 --> 31:39.985
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31:40.028 --> 31:42.857
I re-I refuse to accept that.
I-I've

31:42.901 --> 31:44.685
seen parasites.
Parasites can be removed.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.165
What-what...
How did the people

31:46.208 --> 31:47.209
in this book recover?

31:47.253 --> 31:48.384
HANNAH:
They didn't.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.777
They all died.

31:49.820 --> 31:51.692
These are their death photos.No.

31:51.735 --> 31:54.695
No. No, I, too,
refuse to accept that.

31:54.738 --> 31:55.870
Not today, Satan.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.872
I am sick
of supernatural freeloaders

31:57.916 --> 31:59.656
cutting our lives short.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.702
We just need to expose
which loser parasite

32:01.745 --> 32:03.008
is attached to Nancy.

32:03.051 --> 32:06.185
Without a clear image of
the parasite, we can't.

32:06.228 --> 32:09.275
There is no camera that
I know of that can

32:09.318 --> 32:11.538
capture one at the
exact visual wavelength

32:11.581 --> 32:13.496
that reveals its true being.

32:14.497 --> 32:17.196
Then we make a new camera.

32:17.239 --> 32:19.111
Good news.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.374
I know a guy.

32:21.417 --> 32:23.289
Okay.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.987
[breathing heavily]

32:26.031 --> 32:28.250
[line ringing]

32:28.294 --> 32:29.948
NICK: What's going on?Hey.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.993
Nancy has a supernatural
parasite attached to her,

32:32.037 --> 32:33.603
and I was hoping we could
use the same technology

32:33.647 --> 32:34.996
as your ghost goggles

32:35.040 --> 32:36.476
to create a ghost camera
to get a clear photo of it

32:36.519 --> 32:38.739
so we can figure out what it is
and save Nancy's life.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.089
Say what, now?

32:50.272 --> 32:51.926
[grunts softly]

32:58.933 --> 33:00.848
[door closes]

33:05.548 --> 33:08.464
Well, what do
we have here?

33:09.596 --> 33:11.119
The Black Crown tape.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.731
Clever ruse, son.

33:14.775 --> 33:17.430
So I'm guessing
it wasn't your idea.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.432
[chuckles softly]

33:19.475 --> 33:22.261
You tied up the right guy.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.437
You just tied him up
for the wrong murder.

33:24.480 --> 33:27.266
Then let's tie him up
for the right murder.

33:27.309 --> 33:29.268

Understand when
you have leverage

33:29.311 --> 33:30.878

I'm so sorry, Gil,
for bringing you into this.

When you see your chance,

33:36.014 --> 33:37.450

He'll lead us right to the tape.

this one and Gil Bobbsey did?

Gil who?

I've been with Nancy
all afternoon, alone, so...

I don't know what this
