00:46.646 --> 00:48.480

No! I mean, you don't want
to go to that.

02:01.020 --> 02:04.723
Potluck? There's so many other
fun things to do around here:

02:04.724 --> 02:06.231
- Mahjongg.
- Yeah.

02:06.232 --> 02:07.738
- No.

- Mahjongg.
- Oh. You said that.

02:13.599 --> 02:16.969
- I don't remember saying mahjongg.
- You did, you said it first.

02:17.003 --> 02:18.236

02:22.408 --> 02:23.858
Can we go taste wine now?

02:23.859 --> 02:26.194
Uh, I've never peed
in an Olympic-size pool.

02:26.195 --> 02:28.547
I'm a little nervous
about going for the gold.

02:28.548 --> 02:31.533

There's a drinking fountain.

02:43.396 --> 02:45.046
Okay, we just...
we need a bucket.

02:45.047 --> 02:46.431
Where are the buckets?

02:46.432 --> 02:48.033

my vacation days for this!

Now what? I'm not gonna sit

- It's for my dead dog, Bitsy.

03:24.137 --> 03:27.072
He used to love the sound
of this thing.

03:27.106 --> 03:29.408
- I used to love it, too.
- How'd Bitsy die?

03:29.442 --> 03:32.644
- Python ate him.
- There's pythons in Florida?

03:32.645 --> 03:34.279
They didn't mention that
in the brochure.

03:34.313 --> 03:36.581
Oh, we got everything here.

03:36.582 --> 03:40.152
Pythons, panthers,
predatory stink bugs.

03:40.186 --> 03:41.636
(whimpers) Yup, that's everything.

03:41.637 --> 03:43.004
How do you know
your dog got eaten by a python?

03:43.005 --> 03:45.974
- Did it leave a note?
- Two weeks ago,

03:45.975 --> 03:48.643
I saw my little Bitsy
go into these woods.

03:48.644 --> 03:52.447
Then I saw the python in there.
You do the math.

03:52.448 --> 03:53.715
Ah, no thanks.
We're on vacation.

03:53.716 --> 03:55.684

and move down here myself.

04:10.016 --> 04:11.516
Lin, there's something
you should know.

04:11.517 --> 04:13.919
- Now don't get upset.
- What? What happened?

04:13.953 --> 04:15.353
Uh, this place

04:15.354 --> 04:18.356

04:21.726 --> 04:24.563

- I mean, like adventurous.
- Uh. (blows raspberry)

04:27.700 --> 04:29.584
Yeah, okay.

04:29.585 --> 04:31.153
- Okay.
- Ah.

04:31.154 --> 04:32.654
- I got one.
- Ah...

04:32.655 --> 04:34.689
Hmm?

04:34.690 --> 04:37.092

04:41.898 --> 04:43.331
Oh, my God, Lin.

04:43.332 --> 04:45.267

04:45.268 --> 04:47.836
What, like-like dancers?

04:47.837 --> 04:49.237
- No.
- No.

04:49.238 --> 04:50.672
Like golfers?

04:50.673 --> 04:52.040
- Uh-uh.
- No.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.441

What? Huh?
Oh. (gagging)

I'm sorry about Bitsy. Is this him?

05:00.249 --> 05:02.384
(whistles) He was a snazzy dresser.

05:02.418 --> 05:05.754
- Wait, how big was this snake?
- At least ten feet.

05:05.755 --> 05:07.622
Ten feet of snake?
In there?

05:07.623 --> 05:09.291
Oh, he'd put the squeeze on you.

05:09.292 --> 05:11.192
Oh...

05:11.193 --> 05:13.795
I told the condo association
get rid of it.

05:13.796 --> 05:15.547
They don't believe me.

05:15.548 --> 05:17.699
But that snake's in there,
and it's a killer,

05:17.700 --> 05:19.251
and I'm gonna prove it.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.685
That's why I got this.

05:20.720 --> 05:24.022
The only problem is,
I don't walk so well.

05:24.023 --> 05:26.458
(gasping) You kids
could go in there.

05:26.459 --> 05:29.246

05:33.766 --> 05:34.933
- Yes.
- Yes!

05:34.967 --> 05:39.120
But you've got to get it on there.
No proof, no money.

05:39.155 --> 05:40.472
- No.
- For a hundred bucks,

05:40.473 --> 05:42.407
- we will get that thing on tape.
- No.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.608
- Cheating on his wife.
- No.

05:43.609 --> 05:45.076
- Taking bribes.
- No.

05:45.077 --> 05:46.494
- Uh, shoplifting from a snake mall.
- No.

05:46.495 --> 05:47.913
- Uh, giving up on his dreams.
- No.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.474
We're going to get it all!

05:51.657 --> 05:53.395
Since the first Burmese pythons
<i>were released in Florida,</i>

05:53.426 --> 05:55.427
these voracious predators
have spread

05:55.428 --> 05:57.095
from the panhandle
to the Everglades.

05:57.129 --> 06:00.565
- So Helen's not crazy.
- At least not about this.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.286
They eat rabbits, raccoons,
small dogs, even deer.

06:04.287 --> 06:06.788
I'm too young to be an outline
in a snake's belly!

06:06.789 --> 06:08.273
Gene, get a grip!
(yells)

06:08.274 --> 06:09.808
We're talking about
a hundred dollars.

06:09.842 --> 06:12.477
You once licked a slug
for a bite of a granola bar.

06:12.511 --> 06:14.029
Slugs go well with granola!

06:14.063 --> 06:16.064
Don't worry, Gene. As
long as we stick together,

06:16.065 --> 06:17.832
the snake can't swallow all of us.

06:17.833 --> 06:21.069
Speaking of sticking together,
how about I don't go with you?

06:21.070 --> 06:22.888
I'll stay at base camp.

06:22.889 --> 06:25.724
I'll be the guy who's, uh...
good with computers.

06:25.725 --> 06:27.442

06:27.476 --> 06:28.860
I'm not calling you that.

06:28.861 --> 06:30.862
I really think you should,
because, um,

06:30.863 --> 06:32.480
I'm hacking into the mainframe.

06:32.481 --> 06:34.032
Oh, oh, encryption.

06:34.033 --> 06:35.634
Ha, ha. Right around ya.

06:35.635 --> 06:37.652
And, oh... Activate spellcheck.

06:37.653 --> 06:39.321
Go. I'm in!

06:39.322 --> 06:41.022
What about those two?

06:41.057 --> 06:42.490
- Yes.
- Wow. Ugh.

06:42.525 --> 06:44.676
How about, uh, Earlobes
and uh, Back Hair?

06:44.677 --> 06:46.244
Don't tell me they're into it.

06:46.245 --> 06:48.697
You don't want to know
how into it they are.

06:48.698 --> 06:50.165
That is unbelievable.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.067
Oh, it's not funny,
Bob. It's gross.

06:52.068 --> 06:53.435
No, Lin, it's really funny.

06:53.436 --> 06:54.869
Ma, this is wh...

06:54.870 --> 06:56.538
Why would you want to do that?

06:56.539 --> 06:58.240
Why would you want to live here?

06:58.241 --> 06:59.674
(gagging)

06:59.675 --> 07:01.493
Because the other
places were horrible!

07:01.527 --> 07:03.111
Old people waiting to die.

07:03.112 --> 07:05.397
This place, the people are alive.

07:05.398 --> 07:07.382
They're <i>really</i> alive.

07:07.416 --> 07:09.384
- (laughing): That's amazing.
- Stop it!

07:09.385 --> 07:12.687
We thought, if swinging is part
of it, why not give it a try?

07:12.688 --> 07:15.073
Then we moved here,
and your father got cold feet.

07:15.074 --> 07:16.441
Good for your feet, Dad.

07:16.442 --> 07:17.943
Eh?

07:17.944 --> 07:19.647
It's not good!
It's not good, Al!

07:19.679 --> 07:21.012
No! (mutters)

07:21.047 --> 07:22.714
Can I have a graham cracker, Helen?

07:22.715 --> 07:24.182
Get your own.

07:24.183 --> 07:25.617
You know, we could become

07:25.618 --> 07:27.218
professional python bounty hunters.

07:27.219 --> 07:30.055
We could move here and start
our own reality TV show.

07:30.089 --> 07:31.790
We could call it
<i>Snake It to the Limit.</i>

07:31.791 --> 07:33.358
Or <i>So You Think You Can Snake.</i>

07:33.359 --> 07:34.793
Or <i>Snake and Bake,</i>

07:34.794 --> 07:36.461
if we baked the snake
after we caught it.

07:36.462 --> 07:39.064
Hey, I'm paying you
kids to track, not yak.

07:39.098 --> 07:41.266
Hey, don't get your tights in
a bunch, Helen.

07:41.267 --> 07:43.435
We're gonna find that snake.
See ya, Gene.

07:43.469 --> 07:44.919
Can I have some melon?

07:44.920 --> 07:46.121
- No.
- (grunts)

07:46.155 --> 07:47.555
(animals chittering)

07:47.556 --> 07:48.990
There must be millions
of places in here

07:48.991 --> 07:50.425
where that snake could hide.

07:50.459 --> 07:52.560
Okay, maybe not millions.

07:52.561 --> 07:54.446
Let's try that again.

07:54.447 --> 07:55.880
Florida's weird.

07:55.881 --> 07:57.749
What's going on?
You just left.

07:57.783 --> 08:00.852
- Ugh. Let us work, Helen!
- Then work!

08:00.886 --> 08:02.921
We're working! God!

08:02.955 --> 08:04.406
(grunts) Ow.

08:04.407 --> 08:05.774
Ha! You missed!

08:05.775 --> 08:07.142
Yeah, you missed. Wait.

08:07.176 --> 08:10.095
Ugh. I don't want all these old

08:10.129 --> 08:11.680
horny toads anywhere
near my parents.

08:11.681 --> 08:14.248
I can't believe they got
mixed up in all this.

08:14.249 --> 08:15.917
Easy, Lin.
Your parents are adults.

08:15.918 --> 08:17.335
It's really none of our business.

08:17.336 --> 08:19.404
I'm telling everybody
when we get home.

08:19.438 --> 08:21.906
Ugh! I can't get the
image out of my mind.

08:21.907 --> 08:23.541
A bunch of naked old people

08:23.576 --> 08:24.976
all in a... yuck, naked.

08:24.977 --> 08:26.444
- Oh, hi, kids!
- Hey.

08:26.445 --> 08:28.413
- All in a what?
- Uh... look, over there!

08:28.414 --> 08:30.015
- What?
- I got you. (laughs)

08:30.016 --> 08:31.449
Huh.

08:31.450 --> 08:33.318
Go to bed. All of you. Bed now.

08:33.352 --> 08:35.285
Actually, we were thinking
we'd camp out tonight

08:35.287 --> 08:36.821
in the parking lot by the woods.

08:36.822 --> 08:39.124
Grandpa Al said we
could use his tent. Huh?

08:39.158 --> 08:40.792
In the parking lot?
Away from this?

08:40.793 --> 08:42.427
That's great!
Yeah, great!

08:42.428 --> 08:44.348
But if anyone invites you
to a potluck, run away.

08:44.363 --> 08:45.597
There's a potluck?!

08:45.631 --> 08:47.032
You would not like it.

08:47.033 --> 08:48.700
Really?
What do you mean?

08:48.701 --> 08:50.301
It's hard to explain why
you wouldn't like it.

08:50.302 --> 08:51.720
Well, give me some ideas.

08:51.721 --> 08:53.621
I love the idea
of everyone bringing a dish.

08:55.007 --> 08:56.908
LINDA: Oh, God!

08:56.942 --> 08:58.476
Don't do it while
we're here, please!

08:58.511 --> 08:59.677
Ugh! Oh!

08:59.712 --> 09:01.179
Linda, we've been served

09:01.180 --> 09:03.782
with a Notice
of Failure to Perform.

09:03.816 --> 09:05.517
What? Failure? W-Why? Wha...?

09:05.518 --> 09:08.319
Your parents RSVP'd
"no" to the potluck.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.854
It's clear they have no intention

09:09.855 --> 09:11.823
of taking part fully
in the activities here.

09:11.824 --> 09:13.525
And those who don't
play can't stay.

09:13.526 --> 09:15.193
- Eh.
- They can't?

09:15.194 --> 09:17.095
Tonight's potluck was
their third strike.

09:17.129 --> 09:18.997
They also missed the
Best Ball golf outing

09:18.998 --> 09:21.099
and the South of the
Border fish taco night.

09:21.133 --> 09:23.034
Ugh! Oh!

09:23.035 --> 09:25.103
Wait. So you're kicking them out
for not going to your parties?

09:25.137 --> 09:26.571
You can do that?

09:26.572 --> 09:28.073
It's in our bylaws,
large print edition.

09:28.074 --> 09:29.707
You've got to be part
of the community.

09:29.708 --> 09:31.543
Well, these pots are keeping
their lids on!

09:31.544 --> 09:33.661
Stay away
from their beef and noodles!

09:34.847 --> 09:37.198
(sighs) I'm going to bed.

09:37.199 --> 09:38.933
I hope you're better
at finding snakes

09:38.934 --> 09:41.436
than pitching tents,
because you stink.

09:41.437 --> 09:43.271
Well, I hope you're good
at finding your purse

09:43.272 --> 09:45.073
and ponying up that hundred bucks.

09:45.074 --> 09:46.991
I got the money.
Yeah?

09:46.992 --> 09:48.827
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

09:48.828 --> 09:51.096
- Yeah!
- Yeah?!

09:51.097 --> 09:52.564
Let me see it!

09:52.565 --> 09:54.499
Hey, don't you worry.
I'm good for it.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.201
Just put ten dollars in my hand.

09:56.202 --> 09:58.236
Good night.
Good night, Helen.

09:58.237 --> 09:59.671
Sweet dreams, okay?

09:59.672 --> 10:01.072
I love you, Helen!

10:01.073 --> 10:02.507
And I love your money!

10:02.508 --> 10:04.075
Uh, it's getting dark.

10:04.076 --> 10:06.010
I better go in the tent
and do base camp stuff.

10:06.011 --> 10:07.579
(Gene yelling)

10:07.580 --> 10:09.814
Oh, no! The tent's running away.

10:09.849 --> 10:11.316
Oh, get back here
with base camp, Gene!

10:11.350 --> 10:13.218
I don't want to!

10:13.252 --> 10:15.120
Helen said she'll get you crackers!

10:15.121 --> 10:16.588
HELEN: No, I didn't!

10:16.589 --> 10:18.423
Oh, go to bed, already!

10:18.424 --> 10:19.757
LINDA: <i>Don't you worry, Mom.</i>

10:19.792 --> 10:21.226
I'm sure you and Dad can find

10:21.227 --> 10:22.660
a nice retirement community.

10:22.695 --> 10:24.796
One where a porch swing
is something you sit on

10:24.797 --> 10:26.231
and not strap into.

10:26.232 --> 10:28.099
I sat on that.
It was weird.

10:28.134 --> 10:31.469
We won't be able to afford to
live in a retirement community.

10:31.470 --> 10:33.271
Or even an apartment.

10:33.272 --> 10:35.273
- (sighs) What? Why?
- Why?

10:35.274 --> 10:37.609
If we get kicked out, we'll have
to forfeit our down payment.

10:37.610 --> 10:39.210
(gasps) No.

10:39.211 --> 10:40.778
Well, you know what I'm thinking.

10:40.779 --> 10:43.064
No, no.
You could always...

10:43.065 --> 10:44.415
No, no, no. No.
...move in...

10:44.416 --> 10:46.067
No, no.
...with us.

10:46.068 --> 10:48.470
(yelling) No!

10:48.504 --> 10:49.704
GENE: <i>What kind of animal was that?</i>

10:49.738 --> 10:51.139
Stop being scared, okay?

10:51.140 --> 10:53.241
You're gonna spook Tina.

10:53.242 --> 10:54.709
I'm not spooked. What's the
thing after spooked? I'm that.

10:54.743 --> 10:56.761
Wait, wait!
Let's all stay in the tent.

10:56.762 --> 10:58.179
Let's order tent service!

10:58.180 --> 11:00.882
I'll get...
Ooh. Ooh, this is hard.

11:00.916 --> 11:02.917
I'll get the Cobb salad and...

11:02.918 --> 11:05.320
What do you guys want?
Okay, I'll just put you down

11:05.321 --> 11:08.456
for some spicy wings
and, like, a dill salmon.

11:08.457 --> 11:11.609
What else? Guys! Guys!

11:14.577 --> 11:16.211
(Tina shouts) Shh!

11:16.212 --> 11:18.880
Did you say "shh"?
Or did the snake say "sss"?

11:18.881 --> 11:20.032
(rustling) What was that?

11:20.033 --> 11:21.650
(Tina shouts)

11:21.684 --> 11:23.835
Aah! Qu-Quit shining the light
in my eyes!

11:23.870 --> 11:25.887
Whoops.
I think something's on me.

11:25.888 --> 11:28.056
Is there something on me?
Uh, yes.

11:28.091 --> 11:30.359
It's either a feather
or a scorpion.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.044
(shouting) Get it off!

11:32.078 --> 11:34.379
Tina, stop! Stop!
I'll get it!

11:34.414 --> 11:36.948
No, no, no, no, no!
Now I can't see the scorpion!

11:36.949 --> 11:38.100
(shouts) Drop and roll!

11:38.134 --> 11:39.768
Drop and roll!
(shouts)

11:39.802 --> 11:42.070
Maybe it was a feather.
Just think feather.

11:42.071 --> 11:43.605
I hate feathers.

11:43.639 --> 11:45.941
BOB: <i>Oh, God. Oh.</i>

11:45.975 --> 11:47.609
Oh, stop it.
Oh, no.

11:47.610 --> 11:50.612
If they need a place to live
they will live with us, Bob!

11:50.613 --> 11:53.281
- Case closed!
- Well, why can't they live with your sister?

11:53.282 --> 11:56.284
- Her life is already ruined.
- Gayle has a studio apartment.

11:56.285 --> 11:59.421
- We have three kids and one bathroom.
- Not another word, Bob.

11:59.422 --> 12:02.424
If they get kicked out of here,
then they are staying with us.

12:02.425 --> 12:06.962
Well, then they are not going
to get kicked out of here.

12:06.963 --> 12:09.197
What? Bob, Excuse me.

12:09.232 --> 12:10.582
- Bob, where are you going?
- Nowhere.

12:10.616 --> 12:11.850
What are you doing?
Nothing.

12:11.884 --> 12:14.386
Bob. (sighs) Sheesh.
Bye.

12:14.420 --> 12:16.922
LOUISE:
Snake-hunter to Snake-wuss. Over.

12:16.956 --> 12:18.690
Snake-wuss to... Hey.

12:18.725 --> 12:20.325
We're lost,
our flashlights are gone

12:20.326 --> 12:22.627
and we can't find our way
out of the woods,

12:22.628 --> 12:26.231
which is possibly full of
scorpions... or feathers. Over.

12:26.232 --> 12:27.899
Follow the sound of my voice!

12:27.900 --> 12:29.401
It's on the walkie-talkie, Gene.

12:29.402 --> 12:30.736
Then follow your heart.

12:30.770 --> 12:32.971
You can't go wrong!
Shush! Just shush!

12:32.972 --> 12:34.506
Tina, let's think.

12:34.507 --> 12:36.508
Is there such a thing
as night butterflies?

12:36.509 --> 12:38.760
Please say yes.
(both shouting)

12:38.761 --> 12:41.480
TINA: It could still be
butterflies. No, they're not.

12:41.481 --> 12:44.816
- Hi, Al.
- Eh.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.753
BOB: Looks like a pretty fun party.

12:47.787 --> 12:50.655
(groans) I mean, look, all you
got to do is show up, right?

12:50.656 --> 12:51.957
And then they'll let you stay.

12:51.991 --> 12:54.059
Show up and... and play.

12:54.093 --> 12:56.661
Well, yeah, but, you know,
that's why you came here, right?

12:56.662 --> 12:59.431
I mean, you must have been
excited about it at some point.

12:59.432 --> 13:00.565
What-what happened?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.501
I saw all these other fellas.

13:02.502 --> 13:05.137
- They're just a bunch of... peacocks.
- Mmm. Oh.

13:05.138 --> 13:08.507
Y-You don't want to be the last
breadstick in the basket, huh?

13:08.508 --> 13:10.709
- Ah. (sputters)
- There's, uh...

13:10.710 --> 13:12.711
breadstick pills, you know?

13:12.712 --> 13:14.946
Doc won't let me take those pills.

13:14.947 --> 13:17.115
Bad heart...
and kidney...

13:17.116 --> 13:18.150
- liver...
- Right.

13:18.151 --> 13:20.152
And leg pains and dry mouth.

13:20.153 --> 13:22.053
W-Well, what else gets you going?

13:22.054 --> 13:24.289
Is there anything
you're into? Like, uh...

13:24.290 --> 13:26.825
I don't know...
uh, feet or something? (groans)

13:26.859 --> 13:28.076
- Leather?
- (groans)

13:28.077 --> 13:29.511
- Spanking?
- Eh.

13:29.512 --> 13:32.063
Um, I don't really know any others.

13:32.064 --> 13:34.833
Well, there's one thing.
Gloria doesn't know.

13:34.867 --> 13:36.101
What? What-what is it?

13:36.135 --> 13:38.120
Eh. F-Forget it.

13:38.154 --> 13:39.638
You can tell me, Al.

13:39.672 --> 13:41.673
- (mumbling): Balloons.
- What?

13:41.674 --> 13:44.042
Balloons!
Um, that's great.

13:44.043 --> 13:46.044
I... Wait.
What is that?

13:46.045 --> 13:49.481
I like... to watch
a woman inflate a balloon

13:49.482 --> 13:52.150
and then sit on it till it pops.

13:52.151 --> 13:53.852
It drives me cra-crazy.

13:53.886 --> 13:56.321
No, that's... I mean,
that's what you're into.

13:56.355 --> 14:00.025
Yeah, but Gloria hates
loud noises. It'd never work.

14:00.026 --> 14:03.962
Uh, does it have to pop?
Yes! Pop! Pop! Yes!

14:03.996 --> 14:06.131
What... Where'd-where'd
you see that first?

14:06.165 --> 14:07.999
World Wide Web.
Uh-huh.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.335
Uh, I've... I'll have to,
um... I'll check it out.

14:10.336 --> 14:14.840
- You just... You just, uh... www-dot...
- Mm-hmm.

14:14.841 --> 14:18.610
Women-inflates-a-balloon-and-
sits-on-it-and-pops-it-dot-com.

14:18.611 --> 14:20.212
Yeah. Catchy name.

14:20.246 --> 14:22.631
(groans) How are we still in here?

14:22.632 --> 14:25.133
This is the tiniest
forest in the world!

14:25.134 --> 14:27.302
All of a sudden I feel slower.

14:27.303 --> 14:29.554
And shorter.
We're in a mud hole.

14:29.589 --> 14:31.590
That's it!
I hate Florida!

14:31.591 --> 14:34.543
Gene, come help us!
We're gonna drown in mud

14:34.544 --> 14:36.611
if the snake doesn't eat us first.
I don't believe you.

14:36.612 --> 14:39.981
Send me a picture of you in the
mud holding today's newspaper.

14:39.982 --> 14:42.450
Until you do, I am turning off
the walkie-talkie.

14:42.485 --> 14:44.552
Gene, don't do it!
Don't do it!

14:44.553 --> 14:47.072
He did it.
You're dead to me, Gene!

14:47.073 --> 14:49.928
And we'll be dead, too,
so it's complicated.

14:50.543 --> 14:53.124
- Help!
- Help!

14:53.159 --> 14:54.492
LOUISE: Help! Help!

Oh, sorry. Sorry to startle you.

15:44.176 --> 15:47.112
- so, what are you doing? Dishes?
- Yeah. I guess

15:47.113 --> 15:49.281
I'm gonna have to pack

16:00.226 --> 16:02.460
Who?
Me. I did. Right here.

16:02.461 --> 16:06.298
- What is it?
- Well, the answer may startle you. Literally.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.967
Do you have any earplugs
or headphones?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.869
- And balloons?
- Huh?

16:10.870 --> 16:13.238
And something to share,
'cause it's a potluck.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.340
So we should whip something up.
What do you got in the fridge?

16:15.374 --> 16:16.725
Uh...

16:16.759 --> 16:18.393
Can't hold on much longer.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.229
Tina, help me record my
last will and testament.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.731
If you're watching this, I'm dead.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.050
And I only have
a few things to say.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.235
Don't touch my stuff!

16:27.236 --> 16:28.920
No one gets anything!

16:28.921 --> 16:31.055
I leave it all to my ghost!
(whirring in distance)

16:31.056 --> 16:33.274
What the hell is that?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.327
(shouting)

16:35.328 --> 16:36.611
(thud)

16:36.612 --> 16:37.746
Gene, you came!

16:37.780 --> 16:39.447
Quick. Grab this.

16:39.448 --> 16:43.018
(all grunting)

16:43.052 --> 16:45.720
You saved us, Gene.
I owe you my life.

16:45.721 --> 16:48.406
No, thanks. I've seen it,
and I'm not impressed.

16:48.407 --> 16:50.608
Yellow Belly! Gene!

16:50.609 --> 16:52.327
Your belly's not as
yellow as I thought.

16:52.328 --> 16:54.496
- What happened?
- I didn't want to be an only child.

16:54.497 --> 16:55.797
They're always weird.

16:55.831 --> 16:58.616
Gene mowed us a path.
Drive us out of here.

16:58.617 --> 16:59.651
(snarling)

16:59.685 --> 17:01.269
(all shouting)

17:01.303 --> 17:02.937
(all panting) I hate Florida.
I hate Florida.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.756
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.325
LOUISE: Wh.

17:07.326 --> 17:10.328
- Look. Bitsy's tutu.
- Ah. Yeesh.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.864
This must be the place the snake
comes to digest its prey.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.332
(rustling)

17:15.334 --> 17:17.469
(all shout) (bark)

17:17.470 --> 17:18.619
(barking)

17:18.621 --> 17:20.438
(panting, barks) It's Bitsy!

17:20.439 --> 17:22.840
He passed right through the
snake without being digested!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.492
Like that time I
swallowed a button!

17:24.492 --> 17:26.211
This button.
(barks)

17:27.279 --> 17:28.463
Where are my parents?

17:28.497 --> 17:30.298
Um, getting ready for the party.

17:30.332 --> 17:32.333
- What?! AL:
- Wha...?

17:34.804 --> 17:36.671
What is going on?
(gags)

17:36.706 --> 17:39.441
What?!
Go! Go, you two. Have fun.

17:39.442 --> 17:40.658
- Okay.
- What?!

17:40.659 --> 17:41.960
Okay, bye!

17:41.994 --> 17:43.661
- AL: Eh.
- We're going now!

17:43.662 --> 17:45.296
- Bye-bye.
- AL: Thank you, Bob.

17:45.297 --> 17:46.898
No problem, Al.
Oh, no.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.767
- I wasn't talking to you.
- (chuckling): Oh.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.069
Bob, you tell me what
is happening right now.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.038
Al finally got
into the swing of things.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.739
They're going to the party,
which means

17:54.740 --> 17:57.242
they won't be kicked out,
which means I'm a hero.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.411
Oh, you're a hero
'cause you got my parents

17:59.412 --> 18:00.845
to go to a sex party?!

18:00.846 --> 18:03.815
Well, maybe not a hero,
but, uh, eh.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.383
Great, so they get to stay here

18:05.384 --> 18:07.085
and get passed around
like hors d'oeuvres?!

18:07.086 --> 18:09.471
With crabs!
In their crotches!

18:09.472 --> 18:11.372
Linda, look at them.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.526
(moaning, smacking)

18:14.560 --> 18:17.362
Oh, my God. They haven't
kissed each other

18:17.363 --> 18:19.364
in 20 years.
Ooh, it shows.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.499
I'm sure they'll get better at it.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.103
Huh. I guess if you love
something, you let it go swing.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.772
What's with the balloons?
Oh, it's a long story.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.091
Actually, I kind of
want to try something.

18:30.092 --> 18:31.826
Does this do anything for you?

18:31.827 --> 18:34.529
- (balloon pops) Ooh!
- Maybe...

18:34.530 --> 18:37.332
LOUISE: Well, I guess the only
python was in Helen's head.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.400
"Snakes on a brain." Am I right?

18:39.401 --> 18:41.686
Yes, you are correct!
I can hardly wait

18:41.687 --> 18:43.404
to see the look on Helen's face
when we reunite her with Bitsy.

18:43.405 --> 18:45.390
(doorbell rings)

18:45.391 --> 18:47.725
Oh, you again.
What do you got?

18:47.760 --> 18:50.261
Get your purse out, Helen.
Better yet, go to the bank

18:50.262 --> 18:52.730
and open up your safe...
we've got good news.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.065
You got the snake?

18:54.100 --> 18:55.667
- Better.
- (barking)

18:55.701 --> 18:57.252
Bitsy!

18:57.303 --> 19:00.388
(laughing, kissing)

19:00.389 --> 19:03.391
Oh, what happened to your clothes?

19:03.392 --> 19:06.394
Let's get you into
your big-dog pants. (barks)

19:06.428 --> 19:07.512
Come back!

19:07.546 --> 19:09.514
(barking)

19:09.548 --> 19:12.283
- Bitsy!
- Maybe he doesn't like wearing clothes.

19:12.284 --> 19:14.919
With that body,
I wouldn't either. (growls)

19:14.920 --> 19:16.754
- HELEN: Bitsy!
- Oh, man.

19:16.755 --> 19:19.107
We're never gonna get
our hundred bucks now.

19:19.141 --> 19:20.909
Bitsy!

19:20.943 --> 19:23.795
(crying) Bitsy seemed
really happy in there,

19:23.796 --> 19:26.397
- if it makes you feel any better.
- Oh, yeah?

19:26.398 --> 19:28.399
(crying) Uh, Bitsy!

19:28.400 --> 19:31.953
Whatever you want to do,
I support you!

Can we come back sometime when
they're not cleaning the pool?

19:55.528 --> 19:58.096
- No. Never.
- Absolutely not. Not a chance in hell.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.647
Who were those people
eating breakfast

19:59.648 --> 20:02.083
- with Gram and Gramps this morning?
- Yeah.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.735
Oh, those were the Madisons.

20:03.769 --> 20:06.821
Well, why was Mr. Madison
sitting on Gram-Gram's lap?

20:06.822 --> 20:10.291
She never lets us sit there.
And I have asked.

20:10.326 --> 20:11.659
Honey, he's old. He-he
thought she was a chair.

Right, right.
