01:46.898 --> 01:47.982
What are you...

01:51.694 --> 01:54.489
- What did you do?
- Hey, hey. Is your head okay?

01:55.365 --> 01:56.366
There's some aspirin...

01:56.449 --> 01:57.575
Where are we?

01:57.659 --> 01:58.928
- Wait.
- Where did you bring me?

01:58.952 --> 02:01.704
Jessica! Jessica!

02:01.788 --> 02:03.665
- Oh, shit.
- Jessica.

02:03.748 --> 02:04.748
You hit me.

02:05.750 --> 02:09.044
Spur of the moment.
I couldn't let you turn me in again.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.213
Where are we?

02:10.295 --> 02:13.800
- Uh, in transit.
- To?

02:13.883 --> 02:14.926
It's up to you.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.262
Then we're going to The Raft.

02:17.929 --> 02:18.929
No.

02:19.597 --> 02:20.598
Up to me, my ass.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.476
I have already wasted too much
of my life locked up,

02:23.560 --> 02:26.271
and there is another option.
You can reach me.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.857
Not if I'm unconscious.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.442
You could have
crushed my skull.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.695
But I didn't. I held back.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.531
- Is that supposed to reassure me?
- Yes!

02:36.614 --> 02:37.866
I controlled it.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.325
Because you love me?

02:39.409 --> 02:42.009
Or because I carried you inside me,
or because we're both powered,

02:42.036 --> 02:44.330
or because we've both lost too much.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.085
We don't have to lose each other.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.420
You're insane.

02:50.503 --> 02:51.880
And you're my cure.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.591
Do not put that on me.

02:54.674 --> 02:55.800
And I'm yours.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.552
I am not the one who's sick.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.178
I help people.

03:00.889 --> 03:01.890
I have a life.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.350
You're drunk, 24/7.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.811
You're numbing yourself. Is that a life?

03:10.648 --> 03:13.776
You can make it better.
We can be better. Together.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.183
Get back in the camper.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.491
No. No. Not without you.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.119
I'm not the one
with my face on an APB.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.245
You trying to protect me?

03:24.329 --> 03:26.372
To protect people from you.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.624
It's heroic.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.712
I need you, too.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.469
Just get in.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.720
Please.

03:47.268 --> 03:48.853
You ladies need help?

03:50.688 --> 03:53.024
No. We're just stretching our legs.

03:53.107 --> 03:56.527
Careful out here in the dark.
Dangerous times.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.423
Trish?
Trish, can you hear me?

04:19.716 --> 04:21.678
Her vitals are normal. Strong, actually.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.554
Then why won't she wake up?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.556
Trish? Trish?

04:26.599 --> 04:27.599
Patsy!

04:30.186 --> 04:31.312
Ow.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.820
Oh, sweetheart, you're back.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.281
She's back! She's okay.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.992
I knew you'd make it.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.952
It's that Walker spirit.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.704
Water. I need water.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.873
You just used up two
of your nine lives, Ms. Walker.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.209
Wasn't sure you'd make it.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.548
Jessica? What happened?

04:59.215 --> 05:01.926
She's not any of our concern
right now, baby.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.429
- Is she okay?
- Oh, for God's sake.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.765
Some detective came by earlier.
He'll fill you in later.

05:07.849 --> 05:08.850
How do you feel?

05:08.933 --> 05:10.935
Like crap.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.228
It's no wonder,

05:12.312 --> 05:14.564
given the horror show you put
your body through.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.858
The viruses seem to have
cleared your system.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.736
But we need to assess any lasting damage.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.613
We're running more blood panels,
and we need a stool and urine sample.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.697
Here's a collection kit.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.380
I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'm leaving.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.743
Oh, like hell you are.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.286
Ow!

05:28.369 --> 05:29.871
I'll leave you two alone.

05:29.954 --> 05:32.373
Jessica could be in danger
because of shit I stirred up.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.459
Look at me.

05:36.210 --> 05:39.130
Do you accept
that your life is a disaster?

05:39.213 --> 05:41.591
And that you've royally screwed up
everything in it

05:41.674 --> 05:44.552
and that you're lying here
in its wreckage?

05:44.635 --> 05:46.345
I have to do something.

05:47.638 --> 05:51.350
I can think of a hundred ways
in which you're special, Pats,

05:51.434 --> 05:53.269
but hero ain't one of 'em.

05:53.352 --> 05:54.771
She needs my help.

05:57.940 --> 06:01.861
And what exactly is
a failed radio personality gonna do

06:01.944 --> 06:06.157
that trained law enforcement professionals
and a superpowered woman can't?

06:08.910 --> 06:10.828
Your bedside manner blows.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.830
Well, I'm only human.

06:14.749 --> 06:15.917
Same as you.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.883
And they need a stool sample.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.017
I found a route out of town
via side roads.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.354
It'll take longer to get to the border,
but it's safer.

06:39.899 --> 06:40.983
You could try.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.570
Grab the keys out of the ignition,
but I don't think it'll work.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.988
What else you got?

06:46.072 --> 06:49.033
Stomping on the brake.
Diving out the window.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.785
Punching you into a coma.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.870
Last one might be tough.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.413
Hence my not doing it.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.125
Or you could just pull over.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.169
And let you call in the National Guard?
Then what?

07:00.795 --> 07:02.463
A lot of people would die.

07:02.547 --> 07:03.987
Hence you're not doing that, either.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.842
- I've put you in a bind.
- You meant to.

07:05.925 --> 07:06.968
I just...

07:09.554 --> 07:11.347
I want it to be hard for you to leave me.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.274
I don't know what to do anymore.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.692
I tried to convince you.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.486
I tried to convict you.
I even tried to kill you.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.280
You haven't tried to join me.

07:36.330 --> 07:39.083

07:53.723 --> 07:55.933
I've seen you trying to do something.

07:56.726 --> 08:00.980
To find some meaning,
to fulfill some promise.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.483
- I could do that, too.
- How?

08:04.317 --> 08:07.153
We are the two most powerful women
in the world.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.155
We can do anything.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.001
I won't leave Trish.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.878
She's destroying herself because of you.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.965
Thanks. Like I didn't
already feel shitty enough.

08:28.049 --> 08:32.053
No. People will always feel
"less than" around us.

08:32.135 --> 08:35.556
And that will make them
either resent us or idealize us.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.433
Even Karl.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.602
Some days he put me on a pedestal.

08:39.684 --> 08:42.605
Others, he probably wished
he never met me.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.607
Dimming our light,

08:44.690 --> 08:48.861
limping our way through life,
that is not an option.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.571
Not with the gifts we have.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.951
If you say, "With great power
comes great responsibility,"

08:55.034 --> 08:56.244
I swear I'll throw up on you.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.623
Wouldn't be the first time.
You were a barfy baby.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.589
Hogarth, Chao and Benowitz.

09:36.659 --> 09:39.579
- How may I direct your call?
- Linda Chao, please.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.707
Linda Chao's office.

09:42.790 --> 09:46.127
This is Millard Graves calling to confirm
my meeting with Ms. Chao this morning.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.690
We'd be an amazing team.

10:50.858 --> 10:54.278
You're not the first psychopath
who's wanted to team up with me.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.905
The last time one of us ended up dead.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.574
You really think I'm like Kilgrave?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.869
Only if killing is still a viable option
in your mind.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.998
I don't want it to be.
I want to make up for what I've done.

11:09.835 --> 11:10.878
Jessica.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.631
Please.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.051
Look out!

11:18.260 --> 11:19.470
Shit!

11:20.721 --> 11:22.306
Oh!

11:22.807 --> 11:24.475
Oh. Are you hurt?

11:24.558 --> 11:26.060
No. Yeah, I'm okay.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.186
God damn it.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.146
Oh, my God. Damn it!

11:30.564 --> 11:31.565
Wait.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.151
Shit! Wait!

11:46.664 --> 11:47.832
Get the dad.

11:49.834 --> 11:50.918
Help!

11:52.712 --> 11:55.047
I can't get out.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.550
Ready?

12:00.886 --> 12:03.139
Now. We gotta go.

12:09.687 --> 12:10.687
Come on.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.024
Where's Trudy?

12:14.859 --> 12:17.361
- I got ya.
- Find Trudy. Find Trudy.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.113
Go.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.241
Hang on.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.833
Here! Take my hand.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.210
Shit.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.720
My God!

12:50.644 --> 12:52.855
Someone help me!

12:55.399 --> 12:56.692
Help!

12:56.775 --> 12:57.860
He's still alive! Here.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.820
No, no, no, no.
The fire's too intense.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.406
- I can't just let him die!
- Here.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.242
- No.
- Yes. Save the family.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.578
- Wait! Let me help!
- Go!

13:07.661 --> 13:08.787
Come on.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.876
- Oh, there she is. Trudy.
- Mommy.

13:13.959 --> 13:14.959
Call 911.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.433
Are you all right?

14:12.434 --> 14:14.436
- Are you hurt?
- No. God.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.856
You?

14:34.999 --> 14:37.376
Oh.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.719
Now we move forward into plank.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.681
Belly lifts, tailbone tucks,

14:51.682 --> 14:54.643
and we arrive in upward-facing dog.

14:56.937 --> 15:00.107
Slowly move back into child's pose.

15:02.359 --> 15:06.280
And slowly roll up the spine to seated.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.034
One last inhale in...

15:10.910 --> 15:13.120
And out...

15:17.917 --> 15:19.357
Jeri, you've made terrific progress.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.005
I'm just getting started.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.644
- Where's Jessica?
- I don't know.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.104
- Did they find her mother?
- I don't know.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.316
You have no information about
my escaped client or my investigator?

15:42.399 --> 15:45.361
I don't work for her anymore.
I've gone freelance.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.490
- Well, I like your new dress code.
- Back at you.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.534
- I'll see you Tuesday.
- Yeah.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.000
Why are you here?

16:00.084 --> 16:01.770
Your office said you were working
from home.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.838
My partners have made
the situation there untenable.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.216
Well, I'm here to wrap up your case.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.593
You mean steal my case from Jessica.

16:09.677 --> 16:13.305
- Does it matter?
- Not if you have something I want to hear.

16:13.389 --> 16:17.768
I do. I just came from a very informative
meeting with your partner Linda Chao.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.105
And this... you'll want to see.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.953
That family can describe us.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.872
And after that car flip,
the cops are gonna know it's us.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.376
We need to get to the border.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.714
Wait, what? "We"?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.342
Then "we" are doing this?

16:50.426 --> 16:53.470
Don't get choked up. We still
have to get out of this shitstorm.

16:55.639 --> 16:56.724
Whoo-hoo!

16:59.727 --> 17:00.978
- Whoo!
- All right.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.690
All right. If we wanna...

17:04.772 --> 17:07.901
have a shot at crossing,
I'm gonna have to make a phone call first.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.948
Yeah. Whoo-freaking-hoo.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.681
Thanks for coming.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.476
- You okay?
- Yeah.

17:41.143 --> 17:45.064
I could've gotten a disposable phone
and e-mailed you the pictures.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.940
I just wanted to check on you.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.527
The cops have been at the building.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.863
They think your mom took you.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.324
She did, kind of.

17:58.243 --> 18:02.581
Look, I'm sorry
that you are involved.

18:03.957 --> 18:07.503
Your mom needs papers.
Jessica, I told you I'd help.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.089
All right? Where is she?

18:11.840 --> 18:13.509
Off-site. Um...

18:14.468 --> 18:16.720
It's not just my mom who needs papers.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.933
Please tell me you're joking.

18:21.934 --> 18:22.935
You're for real?

18:25.020 --> 18:27.022
So you're gonna what, go with her?

18:27.773 --> 18:28.982
She's a murderer.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.568
- Jessica, she killed a cop.
- I know.

18:31.652 --> 18:35.030
You can't want this. She's forcing you.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.156
No.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.910
I don't believe that.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.997
You can't just go. You have a life.

18:47.167 --> 18:51.463
You have us, me and Vido.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.970
That, right there.

18:59.721 --> 19:03.475
You connect yourself to your son
with every thought.

19:05.853 --> 19:10.357
You have no idea how isolated I've been.
I had no idea.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.901
They'll come after you.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.113
We'll make it. I just need the papers.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.838
Were you followed?

19:33.422 --> 19:35.591
No one's gonna follow me.
No one knows we're a thing.

19:35.674 --> 19:38.051
- They searched my place?
- Yeah.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.847
Then they saw the painting you did.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.768
They were in my place. They saw my art.

19:46.852 --> 19:47.853
Shit.

19:48.562 --> 19:49.980
They're here?

19:52.983 --> 19:54.526
Why aren't they jumping?

19:54.610 --> 19:56.570
They want me to lead them to her.

19:58.113 --> 20:01.158
Then lead them.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.120
Just get out of this.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.550
Get down.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.977
Stop! NYPD!

20:45.744 --> 20:46.745
Shit.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.998
Take the front. Come on.

21:02.552 --> 21:03.672
Do you have her?

21:03.720 --> 21:04.930
No.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.139
Check those cars.

22:02.487 --> 22:03.864
Let's just drive north.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.741
I don't appreciate being summoned.

22:47.824 --> 22:50.911
And I don't appreciate
a single thing about you, Linda.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.622
I hope, uh, this news you have to tell us

22:53.705 --> 22:56.041
is that you've finally accepted
our exit offer.

22:57.084 --> 23:01.671
Facing death has made me
reexamine my priorities.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.633
To see that life is about people.

23:04.716 --> 23:08.762
Choosing who you surround yourself with.
Choosing very carefully.

23:08.845 --> 23:10.555
This is a business. Not an ashram.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.879
Are you taking the deal or not?

23:11.932 --> 23:13.058
I am.

23:13.141 --> 23:14.559
We'll cut the check immediately.

23:14.643 --> 23:15.977
Just add a few more zeroes to it.

23:18.021 --> 23:22.067
That offer was our last and final.
Guess we'll see you in court.

23:25.946 --> 23:26.947
Linda Chao?

23:27.572 --> 23:30.325
I'm sure you've met
with a number of firms, Mr. Graves?

23:30.909 --> 23:33.412
- I've yet to be impressed.
- Good thing you contacted me.

23:33.995 --> 23:35.973
You're aware of the nature
of my client's business?

23:35.997 --> 23:37.541
Not an unfamiliar world to me.

23:38.041 --> 23:39.519
- My partner...
- Mr. Benowitz?

23:39.543 --> 23:41.211
He has contacts overseas

23:41.294 --> 23:43.839
who can handle your client's assets
with discretion.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.883
Even the simplest
transactions can get complicated

23:46.967 --> 23:48.468
by government agencies.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.888
Which are full of little men
with littler bank accounts.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.974
They just require the right incentive.

23:54.057 --> 23:57.561
It goes on for another martini or two.
But let me summarize.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.354
You've been laundering drug money.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.816
My investigator lured it out
of hot-to-trot here

24:02.899 --> 24:05.277
at the Chocolate Bar, was it?

24:07.571 --> 24:08.905
You hired him?

24:08.989 --> 24:10.469
Relax, Steven, I'm not gonna out you.

24:10.532 --> 24:14.661
But honestly, if you would just come out,
you would be so much less vulnerable.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.330
I-I-I didn't tell him anything.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.208
You told him enough.
He found out the rest.

24:20.292 --> 24:24.129
There's absolutely nothing on that tape
even resembling proof.

24:24.212 --> 24:29.092
Of course not.
I partnered with assholes, not idiots.

24:29.176 --> 24:34.097
But just a whiff of impropriety
can make clients run scared.

24:34.806 --> 24:37.642
Not to mention those little men
at the FBI.

24:37.726 --> 24:38.810
What do you want?

24:38.894 --> 24:41.688
That generous severance? Double it.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.356
And you'll destroy this tape?

24:44.816 --> 24:46.735
I'll keep it to myself.

24:46.818 --> 24:51.239
I will leave today
along with all my clients, including Rand.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.950
That's half our billable hours.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.995
Sixty-two percent, actually.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.831
You'll bounce back someday.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.583
You're not gonna expose us.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.878
You have too many skeletons
in your own seedy closet.

25:04.961 --> 25:10.175
You should be very afraid of the woman
who has absolutely nothing left to lose.

25:17.933 --> 25:21.728
Why is it the most fun
to scorch one's own little patch of earth?

25:22.646 --> 25:24.522
Another satisfied customer.

25:24.606 --> 25:28.109
Oh, please.
I am your one and only customer.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.195
The satisfied part is true enough.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.530
Does that mean I'm hired?

25:33.281 --> 25:35.283
I am the sole partner of a new law firm

25:35.367 --> 25:37.994
in service of several
multi-billion dollar corporations.

25:38.078 --> 25:40.288
You are unlicensed and inexperienced.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.249
And I learned from the best.

25:42.332 --> 25:45.293
Being qualified for Jessica's shingle
doesn't qualify you for mine.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.008
You knew that going in.

25:53.176 --> 25:56.012
I do like the suit, though. I do.

25:56.096 --> 25:59.391
You would still be doing chaturangas
and complaining about your office

25:59.474 --> 26:01.059
if I hadn't shown up.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.520
You showed initiative. You came through.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.358
For which you are being handsomely paid.

26:21.788 --> 26:22.956
- Until next time.
- Hmm.

26:57.073 --> 26:59.409
I think we can get to Montreal
in eight hours.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.953
What about getting across the border?

27:02.037 --> 27:04.080
There's an Adirondack train in Vermont.

27:04.164 --> 27:07.459
So we can ditch the camper
and jump the train, literally.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.587
The benefits of traveling
with a powered person.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.839
From Montreal,
we'll make our way to Uruguay.

27:12.922 --> 27:14.341
No.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.092
Uruguay was Karl's place.

27:16.885 --> 27:20.138
We should, I don't know,
go to a war zone or something.

27:20.764 --> 27:24.392
We have enough people gunning for us
without dropping into a crossfire.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.477
Oh, come on.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.688
What we did back there? I want more.

27:28.772 --> 27:34.069
We could... I don't know...
deliver supplies to needy villages.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.529
Or rescue old people. Or...

27:37.864 --> 27:39.574
Do you want a unitard and a cape, too?

27:39.657 --> 27:42.327
Well, one, I would totally rock a unitard.

27:42.410 --> 27:45.705
And, two,
I just want it to feel so gratifying.

27:47.290 --> 27:50.043
Let's... Let's get out
of the suburbs first.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.966
Oh, come on, another accident?

27:57.717 --> 28:00.387
Shit! Take the next turn.

28:00.470 --> 28:01.471
What?

28:01.554 --> 28:02.764
It's a roadblock.

28:06.726 --> 28:08.561
Slowly. Jesus!

28:13.274 --> 28:14.776
They're not following us.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.446
What the hell is that?

28:21.282 --> 28:22.617
What is that, a phone?

28:23.368 --> 28:24.953
Oh, my God. I forgot I had it.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.247
The kid left it in here. It's in that bag.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.330
Oh, shit.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.169
The kid or his parents
must have gone to the cops.

28:36.631 --> 28:38.883
It's Detective Costa.

28:43.096 --> 28:44.514
Jessica?

28:44.597 --> 28:46.850
Jessica, listen to me.

28:47.809 --> 28:50.645
We know you're helping her.
That makes you an accomplice.

28:52.188 --> 28:54.190
I don't want to see you get hurt.

28:54.274 --> 28:57.485
You're one of the good ones.
I believe that.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.655
But you have to prove it.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.658
Your mother's done.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.911
It doesn't matter what she does next.

29:06.995 --> 29:10.081
She crossed a line
she can't come back from.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.332
But you haven't.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.502
Not yet.

29:18.214 --> 29:19.215
Jessica?

29:20.842 --> 29:22.010
Are you listening?

29:30.477 --> 29:31.561
We get a location?

29:31.644 --> 29:35.899
No pinpoint, but general vicinity.
Near one of our Westchester roadblocks.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.734
Let's load in and move out.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.379
I did this to you.
I'm going to get you killed.

29:58.922 --> 30:01.132
No. It's not over yet.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.720
They don't have the manpower
to block every street in Westchester.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.432
We just have to keep driving west.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.768
We'll find a crowded parking lot
to ditch the camper.

30:11.851 --> 30:13.144
I have an idea.

30:16.439 --> 30:18.066
Come on, let's go.

30:39.504 --> 30:42.298
Dr. Torres thinks you'll be here
for a few days.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.843
Meanwhile, I am gonna start
assessing the damage,

30:44.926 --> 30:46.594
starting with your finances.

30:46.678 --> 30:50.390
I doubt you'll be able to afford
that apartment without a job.

30:50.473 --> 30:52.016
I don't want you working for a while.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.853
We need to let the brouhaha die down.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.104
And then...

30:57.146 --> 31:02.819
we can examine our options
and see how to build you back up again.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.737
Uh, build me?

31:04.821 --> 31:07.532
I'll take care of everything.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.118
Where's Jessica?

31:10.201 --> 31:12.996
I swear to Christ,
if you say Jessica needs her,

31:13.079 --> 31:15.498
I'll shove that badge right up your ass.

31:16.165 --> 31:17.458
I'm glad to see you're alive.

31:17.542 --> 31:21.212
I'm more concerned with finding Jessica
and the psycho who kidnapped her.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.797
Oh, for Chrissake!

31:22.881 --> 31:26.259
Mrs. Walker,
do you mind giving us a moment?

31:33.850 --> 31:37.270
Do not get her involved.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.858
I'm gonna go get your old room all ready.

31:47.989 --> 31:51.618
That car accident...
Jessica was there, wasn't she?

31:51.701 --> 31:54.329
We think they hit a roadblock
in Westchester.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.497
- Westchester?
- Does she know anybody out there?

31:56.581 --> 31:59.042
Why are you asking
about Jessica's contacts

31:59.125 --> 32:01.169
when it's Alisa that's calling the shots?

32:01.252 --> 32:05.381
I'm afraid not. Jessica is aiding
and abetting her mother's escape.

32:05.465 --> 32:09.677
No way. She wouldn't help that psychopath.
Particularly one who tried to kill me.

32:09.761 --> 32:13.181
She ran from the police.
She's hiding Alisa.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.807
She's being forced.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.976
We only get one mother.

32:17.060 --> 32:21.356
That's a powerful bond, no matter
how batshit crazy they might be.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.316
I think you know that.

32:24.108 --> 32:25.777
She wouldn't just leave me.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.987
Maybe she thinks you're better off
without her,

32:28.071 --> 32:31.074
given what you did to yourself.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.911
Just think. You know her best.

32:36.037 --> 32:40.041
Is there any place she might be hiding out
in and around Westchester?

32:45.254 --> 32:46.339
I have no idea.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.261
If anything occurs to you...

32:58.393 --> 33:01.062
I'll try and bring her in safely.

33:01.562 --> 33:02.730
You'll try?

33:46.149 --> 33:47.149
Hey...

33:48.067 --> 33:49.507
I found a sailboat down at the pier.

33:49.569 --> 33:51.738
It's just like the one
you and PopPop used to sail.

33:51.821 --> 33:54.157
Come on. It's dark now.
They won't spot us on the water.

33:57.243 --> 33:58.244
What are you doing?

34:01.789 --> 34:02.790
Hey.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.044
What are you doing? We don't
have time for this. We have to go.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.841
I didn't bring us here
for a walk down memory lane.

34:11.924 --> 34:12.925
There are boats.

34:13.009 --> 34:16.219
You should go. Just walk away, baby.

34:17.263 --> 34:18.973
What are you talking about?

34:31.610 --> 34:32.945
They're gonna see the lights.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.322
Let them come.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.824
It's good that it's here.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.416
So this is it, then?

34:46.918 --> 34:48.960
I will not be the cause of your death.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.005
No.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.842
I will not say goodbye... again.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.637
Don't say anything.

34:59.514 --> 35:00.848
Bye, sweetheart.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.100
No. Wait.

35:03.851 --> 35:06.646
Just let me do this. Please.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.657
What happened to being a team?

35:22.954 --> 35:24.288
Best dream I ever had.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.876
I have gone as far as I can go.

35:28.960 --> 35:33.089
No. You don't get to quit.
Not after what you put me through.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.592
I've done a lot of damage in my life.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.387
But somehow...

35:41.055 --> 35:43.724
you're standing on top of the rubble
like a shining light.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.936
Stop talking to me
like I'm your baby Jesus.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.856
"Hero" isn't a bad word, Jessica.

35:49.939 --> 35:53.192
It's just someone who gives a shit
and does something about it.

35:53.276 --> 35:54.735
Well, I don't. I don't give a shit.

35:54.819 --> 35:55.903
Yes, you do. You do.

35:55.987 --> 35:59.574
It sucks. And it hurts. But you do.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.660
You are far more capable than I ever was.

36:05.204 --> 36:07.373
Maybe I don't have to be amazing.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.418
Maybe I just made you.

36:15.131 --> 36:17.967
No. I won't let you...

36:36.569 --> 36:37.569
No!

36:38.070 --> 36:40.031
- You killed her!
- Before she could kill you!

36:51.417 --> 36:54.128
The police would've shot you both...

36:55.963 --> 36:56.964
I had to.

36:58.424 --> 36:59.842
I had to save you.

37:01.928 --> 37:02.928
Jess...

37:05.306 --> 37:06.349
Jess...

37:07.642 --> 37:08.643
Jess...

37:14.148 --> 37:15.233
Run.

38:59.462 --> 39:02.298
Let me see your hands!
Back away from the body!

39:04.759 --> 39:06.919
West parking lot,
near the bumper cars.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.269
Lower your weapon.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.354
Not a chance.

39:16.437 --> 39:18.981
Don't you see what she's done?
Lower your weapon.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.400
Lower your weapons!

39:48.219 --> 39:51.055
You did the only thing you could, Jones.
There was no other way.

39:53.307 --> 39:54.767
You did the right thing.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.395
Everything changes.

40:43.023 --> 40:45.901
And nothing changes.

40:52.408 --> 40:53.534
People die.

40:54.076 --> 40:55.411
More are born.

40:57.705 --> 40:58.706
And in between...

41:00.583 --> 41:01.834
we exist.

41:09.258 --> 41:11.385
I never wanted to do more than that.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.388
Just exist.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.376
Just give me the cash, man!

41:44.460 --> 41:46.086
- Shit!
- Oh, shit.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.355
Shit!

41:47.379 --> 41:49.089
Goddamn money
or I'll blow your brains out.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.634
- Shit. God damn it. Not again.
- Give me the cash, man!

41:57.765 --> 42:00.309
Bastard! You pig! You dog!
I'm gonna kill you.

42:00.392 --> 42:02.032
Then find your family and kill them, too!

42:02.061 --> 42:04.188
- It's over. You won, okay?
- Shut up!

42:04.897 --> 42:08.025
Get your goddamn phone
and call the goddamn police.

42:08.108 --> 42:09.109
Now.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.705
Dial.

42:26.210 --> 42:29.255
Hello, I've been robbed.

42:30.464 --> 42:31.674
Sonny's Grocery.

42:33.217 --> 42:34.718
52nd and 10th.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.598
You gonna pay for that?

42:43.060 --> 42:46.063
I run a business.
And in this shitty neighborhood.

42:48.357 --> 42:49.400
He had a gun...

43:01.662 --> 43:04.873
I called, texted, e-mailed.

43:07.251 --> 43:10.754
I didn't want it to go down that way,
but it had to be done.

43:10.838 --> 43:12.047
It wasn't your call.

43:12.131 --> 43:14.216
Yes, it was. Because you couldn't make it.

43:15.467 --> 43:19.763
You couldn't see how dangerous she was,
only that she was your mother.

43:20.514 --> 43:24.101
Well, if murder
is how Trish Walker does hero,

43:24.184 --> 43:26.395
then get used to people being pissed off.

43:26.478 --> 43:27.855
I'm not a hero.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.441
I don't know what I am anymore.

43:32.318 --> 43:34.737
I just know that I'm your sister.

43:39.116 --> 43:41.285
I lost the only family I had.

43:43.579 --> 43:44.579
Again.

43:46.665 --> 43:48.334
It was always going to end that way.

43:48.417 --> 43:49.752
It didn't have to be you.

43:53.130 --> 43:56.133
It didn't have to be you.

43:59.345 --> 44:02.806
I look at you now and all I see
is the person who killed my mother.

44:47.851 --> 44:49.478
Oh, sorry.

45:09.373 --> 45:12.251
160 square feet
is not a second year associate's office.

45:12.334 --> 45:13.669
It's a veal crate.

45:13.752 --> 45:15.254
- That one.
- Hmm.

45:17.089 --> 45:20.926
I'm also gonna need you
to soundproof all of the conference rooms.

45:21.009 --> 45:22.553
Mm-hmm.

45:25.264 --> 45:26.598
Hmm? Mnh-mnh.

45:28.183 --> 45:29.476
Six o'clock is here.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.146
Get back to me with the numbers.

45:36.483 --> 45:38.318
- Pryce.
- Jeri.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.903
Thank you for coming.

45:39.987 --> 45:41.864
I think you know my associate.

45:46.618 --> 45:47.828
Come on in. Have a seat.

45:51.498 --> 45:54.585
I was surprised to hear from you,
given I still can't deadlift a car.

45:54.668 --> 45:58.005
Well, there are tasks for which
Jessica Jones is not well-suited.

45:58.088 --> 46:00.632
Some, like this one,
she may even object to.

46:00.716 --> 46:01.633
What's the job?

46:01.717 --> 46:04.052
You'll have complete autonomy.
A generous retainer.

46:04.136 --> 46:06.722
- And the job is?
- Business opportunity.

46:09.641 --> 46:11.685
That Jessica Jones might object to.

46:11.768 --> 46:14.021
Discretion is essential.

46:14.104 --> 46:15.898
- That won't be a problem.
- For you.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.734
What about your associate here?

46:25.574 --> 46:26.575
Is it legal?

46:28.368 --> 46:29.953
That is entirely up to you.

46:31.747 --> 46:32.789
When do we start?

46:35.167 --> 46:37.753
Welcome to Jeryn Hogarth and Associates.

47:28.554 --> 47:30.097
I've gone through life...

47:33.058 --> 47:34.142
untethered,

47:37.479 --> 47:38.814
unconnected...

47:42.109 --> 47:44.611
I wasn't even aware that I'd chosen that.

48:44.880 --> 48:48.008
It took someone coming back
from the dead...

48:49.551 --> 48:51.511
to show me that I've been dead, too.

48:53.597 --> 48:54.598
It's open!

48:54.681 --> 48:58.977
The problem is,
I never really figured out how to live.

49:08.070 --> 49:10.447
- Hi, Jessica.
- What's up, Vido?

49:10.989 --> 49:13.283
Hey, you're here.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.662
Still a standing invitation?

49:16.745 --> 49:20.749
Always. Come on.
Grab another plate, buddy.

49:26.046 --> 49:28.173
- We're celebrating.
- Yeah?

49:28.256 --> 49:29.341
It's not a big deal.

49:29.424 --> 49:30.759
What's not a big deal?

49:31.843 --> 49:33.512
Papi got a show.

49:33.595 --> 49:36.139
It's a small gallery
no one's ever heard of.

49:36.223 --> 49:37.224
Still.

49:37.849 --> 49:39.518
What about my good news?

49:48.276 --> 49:51.154
I hate starting
at the beginning...

49:55.617 --> 49:57.244
You've been getting back to work?

49:57.327 --> 49:59.079
You got any cool cases you're working on?

49:59.162 --> 50:01.331
Yeah, did you save anybody today?

50:04.668 --> 50:07.212
Yeah. Actually, yeah, I did.

50:07.295 --> 50:09.589
What happened?
Did you have to hit someone?

50:09.673 --> 50:10.841
After dinner, Vido.

50:10.924 --> 50:12.467
Oh, come on, I wanna hear it now.

50:20.016 --> 50:22.060
Well, I was buying whiskey
at this liquor store

50:22.144 --> 50:25.647
and this guy came in,
and he was all jumpy and dope-sick.

50:25.731 --> 50:27.566
And I knew he was there to rob the place.

50:27.649 --> 50:30.068
- Because of your super sense?
- I don't have super sense.

50:30.152 --> 50:31.236
Let her tell it.

50:33.405 --> 50:35.449
Anyway, sure enough,
the guy pulled out a gun.

50:35.532 --> 50:38.827
It was a whole thing and...
I stopped it.

50:40.412 --> 50:41.413
That's it?

50:44.082 --> 50:46.209
I may have thrown a bottle at his head.

50:46.293 --> 50:47.294
Cool.
