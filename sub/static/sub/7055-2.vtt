There is an infinite
number of Universes,

00:03.557 --> 00:06.192
and in each of them,
there is a version of us.

00:06.276 --> 00:07.727
Previously, on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:07.811 --> 00:09.145
Just because you walked
in my shoes,

00:09.196 --> 00:10.530
don't you think
for a moment

00:10.614 --> 00:12.148
that you know me.

00:14.818 --> 00:16.536
You are just
incapable of trust.

00:16.620 --> 00:18.187
Coming from the person
who kidnapped me

00:18.238 --> 00:19.522
and stole my life.

00:19.573 --> 00:21.374
I have torn holes
in both the Universes

00:21.458 --> 00:25.694
so that we can begin
to work together to fix--

00:25.746 --> 00:28.548
You were right.
They don't remember Peter.

00:28.632 --> 00:31.100
He served his purpose.

00:31.168 --> 00:32.885
The timeline
has been rewritten,

00:32.970 --> 00:36.539
and yet, traces of him
continue to bleed through.

00:36.590 --> 00:38.674
He was here,
and then he was gone.

00:38.726 --> 00:40.810
I saw him!

00:46.066 --> 00:50.770
Tell me about the day
the picture was taken.

00:52.689 --> 00:55.525
I think I was
six years old.

00:55.576 --> 00:57.860
We'd go camping...

00:57.911 --> 01:02.632
In the White Mountains
in the summer.

01:02.699 --> 01:04.667
Who took the picture?

01:04.733 --> 01:08.337
My mom.

01:08.405 --> 01:11.007
I remember she was laughing.

01:11.074 --> 01:14.043
Do you have a good
relationship with her?

01:16.413 --> 01:17.930
I miss her very much.

01:18.015 --> 01:20.883
Ah, ah, ah.

01:20.951 --> 01:23.102
Let's go...

01:23.187 --> 01:25.304

01:36.116 --> 01:38.201
<i>It's almost over.</i>

01:38.268 --> 01:40.453
My brothers and I...

01:40.537 --> 01:42.955
We begged her
to keep it.

01:43.040 --> 01:47.076
We wore her down.

01:49.079 --> 01:50.779
She said yes.

01:53.801 --> 01:58.671
We named him Fred.

01:58.755 --> 02:02.341

Cerebral hypothermia.

Okay, well, why don't you

07:39.795 --> 07:42.013
interact with the space,
study his belongings,

07:42.098 --> 07:44.599
he can glean something
that we can't.

07:44.650 --> 07:45.650
Well, you hope he can.

07:45.734 --> 07:47.602
Well, I lived

Over here, we're in charge.
Over there, they are.

08:17.166 --> 08:19.384
It is only simple

08:19.468 --> 08:21.352
What about that tech
we gave them

08:21.437 --> 08:23.171
that we took
from the human shape-shifter?

08:23.222 --> 08:24.305
I mean, have we even
heard back?

08:24.356 --> 08:25.940
Their science division
is still working on it.

08:26.008 --> 08:27.508

08:30.179 --> 08:31.146
Look.

08:31.197 --> 08:33.847
I know this is difficult

08:33.916 --> 08:36.017
If there was any other way
to execute this,

08:36.068 --> 08:38.068
I'd ask someone else.

08:38.154 --> 08:39.736
Okay, how is this even

08:52.551 --> 08:54.052
On our side,

McClennan teaches

08:57.539 --> 09:00.708
His area of study:

09:02.595 --> 09:04.562
Look, I don't know

09:17.159 --> 09:18.993

09:24.533 --> 09:27.752

09:37.763 --> 09:41.082

This case is highly classified.

09:45.938 --> 09:47.305

09:55.731 --> 09:56.981

09:57.066 --> 09:59.100
Well, it's a long journey,
and I assure you,

09:59.151 --> 10:00.451
it'd be more comfortable
this way.

10:00.536 --> 10:01.452

with cruelty

23:49.893 --> 23:52.561

23:52.646 --> 23:55.448
She taught me that I didn't have
to live in the darkness.

23:55.515 --> 23:58.234
That when I got the urges,

23:58.318 --> 23:59.819

out of it

23:59.886 --> 24:01.938

24:02.022 --> 24:03.522
This--this is crazy.

24:03.573 --> 24:04.907
This--this is--

24:04.992 --> 24:07.493
because sometimes when I, um,

24:07.560 --> 24:11.197

been like without her...

24:17.287 --> 24:19.422

this way.

24:37.057 --> 24:39.091

25:29.359 --> 25:32.028

26:01.558 --> 26:02.858
This was my idea.

26:02.943 --> 26:04.843
I'm not interested
in culpability right now.

26:04.895 --> 26:06.011
Do we have any leads?

26:06.063 --> 26:07.613
We think we know
where he's going.

26:07.680 --> 26:08.697
You don't sound
entirely convinced.

26:08.815 --> 26:10.182
We--we--

26:10.233 --> 26:12.118
<i>we think that he's trying</i>
<i>to find the killer.</i>

26:12.185 --> 26:14.036
And why would he do that?

26:14.154 --> 26:17.957
Because, we believe,
he wants to stop him.

26:18.024 --> 26:20.910
We're online.

26:23.630 --> 26:25.864
Professor John McClennan
is not from here.

26:25.916 --> 26:27.800
The differences
between his Universe and ours

26:27.867 --> 26:29.085
will take him time
to comprehend,

26:29.169 --> 26:30.753
which will make it easier
to track him.

26:30.837 --> 26:32.037
<i>He does not have a "show me,"</i>

26:32.089 --> 26:34.206
<i>which means his access</i>
<i>to public transportation</i>

26:34.257 --> 26:35.424
is restricted.

26:35.509 --> 26:36.976
Although given
a psychological profile,

26:37.043 --> 26:38.844
there's a 43.2% chance

26:38.929 --> 26:40.712
that under extraordinary
circumstances,

26:40.764 --> 26:42.714
he would be willing to steal
someone's identification.

26:42.766 --> 26:45.317
I'd say this is pretty
extraordinary.

26:45.385 --> 26:46.885
Initial calculations indicate

26:46.987 --> 26:49.772
that there are 219
potential routes

26:49.856 --> 26:51.907
he could've taken
in the time he's been missing,

26:51.992 --> 26:53.909
but the possibilities
branch out exponentially

26:54.027 --> 26:56.529
the longer that he's out there.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.330
Even with our
facial recognition programs,

26:58.398 --> 26:59.448
going through
that much data

26:59.566 --> 27:00.749
is going to take
a long time.

27:00.834 --> 27:02.901
<i>How long?</i>

27:02.953 --> 27:06.338
13 hours, plus or minus.

27:06.406 --> 27:08.740
If you're right,
Agent Dunham,

27:08.792 --> 27:10.926
then finding Professor McClennan
is our best chance

27:11.011 --> 27:12.545
to save Noreen Miller.

27:12.596 --> 27:13.712
Let me know
when you have something.

27:13.763 --> 27:17.299
Yes, sir.

27:22.589 --> 27:24.023
I have an idea.

27:24.090 --> 27:25.941
You know, that woman processes
more information in an hour

27:26.026 --> 27:27.610
than you and I will
in a lifetime,

27:27.694 --> 27:29.761
so if she hasn't thought of it,
it's not there.

27:29.863 --> 27:31.530
Yes, but she didn't see
the photograph of John's father,

27:31.598 --> 27:32.698
and I did.

27:32.765 --> 27:35.201
Now, John said his father worked
as a farmhand,

27:35.268 --> 27:36.602
so if we can trace the farm,
then we--

27:36.653 --> 27:37.903
Yeah, but we can't

27:37.954 --> 27:39.271
because John's father
didn't own the farm,

27:39.322 --> 27:40.372
so his name wouldn't be on it.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.957
I understand,
but in the photograph,

27:42.075 --> 27:43.542
he was standing
in front of a tractor

27:43.610 --> 27:44.910
with commercial plates.

27:44.995 --> 27:47.779
Pennsylvania, TR-53-879.

27:47.831 --> 27:49.882
We can trace the registration.

28:29.432 --> 28:30.699
Weir Farm.

28:30.783 --> 28:33.214
Shut down ten years ago,
after the Richboro fires.

28:33.334 --> 28:36.503
It's been unoccupied
ever since.

28:36.570 --> 28:38.121
<i>Noreen Miller.</i>

28:38.206 --> 28:40.740
Goes without saying,
but I'm still gonna say it.

28:40.792 --> 28:42.843
All necessary steps
should be taken

28:42.910 --> 28:45.595
to bring her home unharmed.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.547
<i>Any questions?</i>

28:47.598 --> 28:49.582
Let's go.

28:49.634 --> 28:51.518
Ride with me.

28:55.189 --> 28:58.241
It doesn't have to be
like this.

28:58.309 --> 29:00.610
You don't have to hurt her.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.782
You're going
for your .45 silver.

29:05.867 --> 29:07.701
<i>You keep it</i>
<i>in the toolbox.</i>

29:11.823 --> 29:14.791
How did you know that?

29:16.911 --> 29:18.495
How did you know that?

29:18.613 --> 29:21.882
<i>What are you?</i>

29:21.949 --> 29:24.084
That's where he kept it.

29:24.152 --> 29:27.921
<i>My dad.</i>

29:27.972 --> 29:29.956
<i>What are you?</i>

29:30.007 --> 29:33.510
I was like you.

29:33.594 --> 29:36.313
And then,
one night in October,

29:36.397 --> 29:37.898
I-I went to a fair.

29:37.965 --> 29:40.350
<i>I-I was ten.</i>

29:40.435 --> 29:43.520
And that's the night
that my father found

29:43.604 --> 29:45.439
<i>the dead things.</i>

29:45.490 --> 29:47.407
<i>Only I didn't know that yet.</i>

29:47.475 --> 29:48.575
I-I was playing carnival games,

29:48.642 --> 29:50.026
and I-I-I saw him
coming toward me,

29:50.111 --> 29:52.412
and then I knew
that he knew.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.497
The moment I saw him,
I-I knew--

29:53.581 --> 29:54.865
that's my life.

29:54.949 --> 29:57.784
That's what happened to me.

29:57.835 --> 30:00.320
It was the ring toss
that I was playing.

30:00.388 --> 30:02.672
Yeah.

30:02.757 --> 30:06.660
Me too.

30:06.727 --> 30:07.677
I hid.

30:07.762 --> 30:10.464
Behind the wagon wheel.

30:10.531 --> 30:12.132
But he found me.

30:12.183 --> 30:13.300
Grabbed me by the collar.

30:13.351 --> 30:14.801
His fingernails cut
into my neck.

30:14.852 --> 30:16.169
He dragged me home,
and he beat me

30:16.220 --> 30:17.504
for three days straight.

30:17.555 --> 30:18.722
Not me.

30:18.806 --> 30:19.773
I ran.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.359
As far, as fast,

30:22.443 --> 30:23.443
as long as I could.

30:23.511 --> 30:25.695
I woke up in a field,

30:25.763 --> 30:29.316
and this woman...

30:29.383 --> 30:31.117
was standing over me.

30:31.185 --> 30:33.737
Her name was Marjorie.

30:33.821 --> 30:38.525
And because of her, I--

30:38.593 --> 30:40.727
I don't have to do
what you do

30:40.795 --> 30:42.362
to stop the pain.

30:42.413 --> 30:44.364
You can't control it.

30:44.415 --> 30:45.698
- If you're like me--
- I can control it.

30:45.750 --> 30:46.967
- It can never stop.
- She taught me how.

30:47.034 --> 30:48.201
No.

30:48.252 --> 30:49.553
This is the only way.
I do this.

30:49.637 --> 30:51.037
And for a while--
I can stop the urges.

30:51.088 --> 30:55.342
- It's quiet.
- No.

30:55.393 --> 30:56.726
I know the screams
inside your head

30:56.811 --> 30:57.928
that won't stop.

30:58.012 --> 31:00.931
<i>It's a horrible place</i>
<i>to be.</i>

31:01.015 --> 31:03.216
But I can help you.

31:03.267 --> 31:06.319
Like Marjorie helped me.

31:06.387 --> 31:10.557
You can step out
of the darkness.

31:10.608 --> 31:12.659
Don't you want the pain to end?

31:12.726 --> 31:14.494
Yes.

31:14.562 --> 31:16.496
I can show you how.

31:20.001 --> 31:22.735
Maybe you can.

31:35.550 --> 31:38.718
What you said to John
about your stepfather--

31:38.769 --> 31:41.087
you were trying
to open him up, huh?

31:41.138 --> 31:42.922
Yes.

31:42.974 --> 31:44.307
It's also true.

31:54.068 --> 31:55.285
So what happened to him?

31:55.369 --> 31:56.769
My stepfather?

31:56.821 --> 31:59.839
I killed him.

32:03.077 --> 32:04.544
<i>Get a lockdown perimeter going.</i>

32:04.612 --> 32:06.796
<i>Got it.</i>

32:43.334 --> 32:44.501
Ah.

32:44.585 --> 32:46.536
Ah, ahhhhh.

32:52.460 --> 32:56.496
We are ready to begin.

32:56.547 --> 32:59.633
Tell me...

32:59.684 --> 33:02.669
About your happiest memories.

33:04.171 --> 33:06.890
Tell me about Marjorie.

33:22.456 --> 33:24.074
Take the upstairs.

33:24.158 --> 33:25.759
<i>Get the hallway.</i>

33:25.826 --> 33:28.244
We're clear!

33:30.197 --> 33:33.299
<i>Back room's clear!</i>

33:33.384 --> 33:35.201
<i>We got nothing, sir!</i>

33:41.892 --> 33:44.260
<i>We're all clear, sir!</i>

33:44.345 --> 33:45.311
Damn it.

33:45.379 --> 33:48.064
We're in the wrong place.

33:58.341 --> 34:01.416
What are you thinking?

34:01.421 --> 34:03.722
Over there.

34:13.283 --> 34:15.766
There was a structure here.

34:15.869 --> 34:18.904
Um, it could be anything.
A shed, a barn.

34:21.157 --> 34:23.876
There's another one.

34:25.712 --> 34:28.664
There was a group
of structures here.

34:32.886 --> 34:35.888
This is where
the family lived.

34:51.654 --> 34:54.639
How did Marjorie
make you feel?

34:57.410 --> 34:59.411
Safe.

35:04.034 --> 35:06.218
She was so kind.

35:06.319 --> 35:09.788
So gentle.

35:54.534 --> 35:57.136
I never understood
how someone so beautiful

35:57.203 --> 36:00.055
could love something
so dark.

36:13.686 --> 36:15.938
You...

36:16.022 --> 36:17.823
Don't have to do it...

36:17.890 --> 36:19.658
Anymore.

37:01.651 --> 37:05.571
She's sedated,
but her pulse is strong.

37:17.584 --> 37:19.618
John, put your hands
where I can see them.

37:19.719 --> 37:22.137
I wanted what he had.

37:22.222 --> 37:24.339
What she gave him.

37:24.424 --> 37:25.790
John, put your hands up.

37:25.842 --> 37:30.229
I took her from him.

37:30.296 --> 37:33.165
I shouldn't have.

37:33.233 --> 37:35.534
She made him...

37:35.602 --> 37:37.819
Feel for them.

37:37.904 --> 37:41.607
What have I done
to all of them?

37:45.478 --> 37:47.979
Marjorie?

37:48.031 --> 37:49.998
What have I done?

38:10.002 --> 38:13.222
How is the Professor?

38:13.306 --> 38:14.806
There appears to be
no permanent damage

38:14.857 --> 38:17.976
to his motor functions
or cognitive ability.

38:18.027 --> 38:20.812
He is, however, suffering
from partial memory loss.

38:20.863 --> 38:21.880
Partial?

38:21.948 --> 38:23.365
He's unable to recall
the events

38:23.449 --> 38:24.650
of the last few weeks.

38:24.717 --> 38:26.618
He has no memory
of ever being involved

38:26.686 --> 38:27.852
in this case.

38:27.904 --> 38:30.489
What about Marjorie?

38:30.540 --> 38:33.075
His memories of Marjorie
were extracted.

38:33.192 --> 38:35.043
The neurologists believe
the loss is permanent.

38:35.128 --> 38:36.745
But for all we know,
she's the only thing

38:36.829 --> 38:37.879
that's preventing him from--

38:37.964 --> 38:40.465
I know.

38:40.533 --> 38:41.633
Once he's released,

38:41.701 --> 38:42.918
we'll have to keep
an eye on him.

38:43.002 --> 38:46.221
Can I talk to him?

38:46.306 --> 38:47.723
He's been told he was injured
doing profiling work

38:47.807 --> 38:48.807
for the FBI.

38:48.874 --> 38:50.875
Okay.

38:57.734 --> 38:59.234
<i>Hi.</i>

39:02.522 --> 39:05.524
Do you remember me?

39:07.677 --> 39:10.679
Nothing at all?

39:12.899 --> 39:14.283
I'm Olivia Dunham.

39:14.367 --> 39:16.601
I'm one of the FBI agents
who was working on the case.

39:16.669 --> 39:19.237
They tell me I saved
a woman's life.

39:19.305 --> 39:22.291
Yes.

39:22.375 --> 39:24.176
And probably many more.

39:24.243 --> 39:27.462
I came to say thank you.

39:27.547 --> 39:29.348
Just glad I could be of help.

39:36.522 --> 39:39.958
Do you remember Marjorie?

39:40.026 --> 39:44.646
The other agent
asked me that too.

39:44.731 --> 39:46.765
No.

39:46.833 --> 39:50.836
But things are pretty dark
right now.

39:50.903 --> 39:55.490
Did she have something to do
with the investigation?

39:55.575 --> 39:58.577
Sort of.

40:02.498 --> 40:05.884
Feel better soon.

40:05.951 --> 40:08.804
You know what they say.

40:08.888 --> 40:11.323
That even when
it's the darkest,

40:11.391 --> 40:13.909
we can step into the light.

40:17.230 --> 40:18.513
He knows what she taught him,

40:18.598 --> 40:20.632
but he can't remember
who she is.

40:20.683 --> 40:23.935
How is that possible?

40:23.986 --> 40:27.856
At the risk
of sounding sentimental...

40:27.940 --> 40:29.974
I've always thought
there were people who leave

40:30.026 --> 40:32.861
an indelible mark
on your soul.

40:32.945 --> 40:34.613
An imprint
that can never be erased.

41:22.929 --> 41:24.880
<i>Walter, I'm here.</i>

41:24.964 --> 41:28.417
Who are you?

41:28.501 --> 41:29.835
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

41:29.886 --> 41:31.169
<i>I'm right here.</i>

41:31.220 --> 41:32.220
No.

41:32.305 --> 41:34.339
<i>Walter, I'm right here.</i>

41:34.390 --> 41:35.590
No, you're not.

41:35.675 --> 41:37.843
<i>I'm here, Walter.</i>

41:37.894 --> 41:39.227
You--

41:39.312 --> 41:40.729
you're just a fig--

41:40.813 --> 41:42.898
a figment!

41:42.982 --> 41:48.520
<i>Walter, I'm right here.</i>

41:48.571 --> 41:49.821
<i>I'm here, Walter.</i>

41:49.889 --> 41:51.556
<i>Right here.</i>

41:51.607 --> 41:52.741
<i>Walter, I'm here.</i>

41:52.825 --> 41:55.059
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>I'm right here.</i>

41:55.111 --> 41:56.628
<i>Walter.</i>

41:56.696 --> 41:58.663
<i>Help me, Walter.</i>

41:58.731 --> 42:00.031
<i>Please help me.</i>
