D'oh!

01:22.115 --> 01:25.243
<i>Welcome back to</i> Pigskin Preview!

01:25.351 --> 01:28.115
- Denver/Green Bay-Who do you like?
- That's football, right?

01:30.090 --> 01:32.058
Well, I'm gonna take
the Broncos in this game...

01:32.158 --> 01:35.218
'cause the Packers will be
blinded byJerry's tie.

01:36.296 --> 01:38.821
Tremendous.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.298
I'm more worried
about Al's jacket.

01:41.401 --> 01:44.029
How many stations
can you get on that thing?

01:45.605 --> 01:48.506
All right. Listen. I am sick
of your jokes about the wardrobe!

01:48.608 --> 01:51.372
You people can
dress yourselves!

01:51.478 --> 01:54.174
Well, folks, he's got a point.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.148
Uh, with all our unscripted horseplay,
we sometimes don't think about-

01:58.251 --> 02:00.344
Lenny, are you watching this?

02:00.453 --> 02:03.616
- Yeah. They really hurt that guy's feelings.
- I know!

02:03.723 --> 02:06.624
- Ready for the circus, Homer?
- Circus?

02:06.726 --> 02:10.389
The Cirque de Purée.
We've had tickets since <i>Septembre.</i>

02:10.497 --> 02:12.397
But I want to
watch Brett Favre!

02:12.499 --> 02:15.627
Come on, Homer.
They're only in town for eight months.

02:15.735 --> 02:18.795
Then they're gone.

02:18.905 --> 02:23.171
Oh! I missed one ofJerry's zingers.
Now I'll never catch up.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.608
Mmm!

02:28.681 --> 02:32.708
Finally, a circus
full of whimsy and wonder.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.481
Oh, yeah. That's way better
than fun and excitement.

02:35.588 --> 02:38.648
As French Canadians,
they don't believe in refunds...

02:38.758 --> 02:41.022
or exploiting animals
for entertainment.

02:41.127 --> 02:45.120
Oh! I wanted to see 'em fire
a gorilla out of a cannon.

02:45.231 --> 02:48.462
Enjoy the show.
For one day, we shall die.

02:50.303 --> 02:53.033
Ohh!

02:54.073 --> 02:58.169
Stop! Wait! Wait!
<i>Attendez!</i>

02:58.278 --> 03:02.237
I cannot get the lid
off my jar of rainbows!

03:02.348 --> 03:05.408
Who will help me?
You, sir?

03:05.518 --> 03:07.418
But I cannot help you.

03:07.520 --> 03:11.012
I am just a local merchant
from, uh, this town.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.558
Just smash it open!

03:13.660 --> 03:16.527
Oh, you can do it
if your heart is pure-

03:16.629 --> 03:20.827
or... <i>purée.</i>

03:30.643 --> 03:33.407
They always pick
the guy with the wires.

03:35.481 --> 03:38.973
<i>Oh, look at those exotic positions.</i>

03:39.085 --> 03:42.680
Watching those women
is giving me ideas.

03:48.861 --> 03:51.329
<i>They made an elephant!</i>

03:52.432 --> 03:56.459
It's hauntingly beautiful, isn't it?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.768
<i>A storm is coming!</i>

04:05.878 --> 04:07.709
I feel it in my bone!

04:07.814 --> 04:12.808
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,</i> it appears
the Cloud Goddess is ripe with rain babies.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.616
We must run for our trucks!

04:16.723 --> 04:21.057
Oh, no, you don't!
I paid full price for this freak show!

04:21.160 --> 04:23.424
Now, nourish the child
within me!

04:23.529 --> 04:26.054
Nourish!

04:29.235 --> 04:31.703
<i>Un, deux, trois!</i>

04:35.475 --> 04:38.069
<i>Well, sir,</i>
<i>we've got ourselves a classic nor'easter...</i>

04:38.177 --> 04:39.667
<i>meeting a classic sou'wester.</i>

04:39.779 --> 04:42.373
Overnight, expect rain
turning to freezing rain...

04:42.482 --> 04:44.450
<i>turning to sleet</i>
<i>turning to snow...</i>

04:44.550 --> 04:46.518
- <i>and then melting in the summer.</i>
- Snow?

04:52.558 --> 04:54.894
- Maybe they'll cancel school!
- Look. The sea captain's all hunkered down!

04:55.061 --> 04:58.030
Arr! Help.
I was tied here by teenage pirates.

04:59.932 --> 05:02.400
Shelbyville, Ogdenville...

05:02.502 --> 05:04.595
Ogdenville Tech, and Springfield
Elementary...

05:04.704 --> 05:06.672
My Dear Watson Detective School.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.297
Ohh!

05:08.408 --> 05:11.172
- And lastly, Springfield Elementary School...
- Yea!

05:11.277 --> 05:13.609
- Is open.
- Ohh!

05:13.713 --> 05:17.513
And it's open season on savings at
Springfield Menswear, which is closed.

05:17.617 --> 05:20.586
- Oh! Everyone's off but us.
- Oh, stop.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.882
Your father and I
don't get the day off.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.890
Lenny says we've got the day off!
Yippee!

05:28.027 --> 05:31.895
One snow angel coming up!

05:31.998 --> 05:33.693
Huh?

05:33.800 --> 05:36.098
Oh, why does that
always happen?

05:42.775 --> 05:45.642
Man. Everyone has
a snow day but us.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.645
Oh!
They look wonderful!

05:47.747 --> 05:50.477
Ah! Yeah!

05:52.185 --> 05:55.450
Ah, yeah, Clancy.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.682
Spell your name.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.452
Uh, hey, Lou, could you shake out
the last few drops for me?

06:00.560 --> 06:02.585
Yeah,
no problem, Chief.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.788
Seems like a waste
of coffee, though.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.000
<i>Children, I'm proud of you.</i>

06:09.102 --> 06:12.731
<i>Most of our students didn't bother to show</i>
<i>up on this last day before Christmas break.</i>

06:12.839 --> 06:16.434
But you've kept intact my Cal Ripken-like
streak of school "openage."

06:16.542 --> 06:21.241
- Hey, where are the teachers?
- Eh, their union just called an emergency caucus.

06:21.347 --> 06:25.181
# Caucus, caucus, caucus
Caucus, caucus, caucus #

06:25.284 --> 06:28.947
But we'll have the last laugh
on thoseJohnny-come-not-lies.

06:29.055 --> 06:33.116
We're gonna watch my favorite movie
about a Grinch-y little character...

06:33.226 --> 06:35.592
who tries to steal Christmas.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.834
Ho, ho, ho.
What's that, Blitzen?

06:43.936 --> 06:46.996
Why, yes,
it <i>is</i> Christmas Eve.

06:47.106 --> 06:49.097
I'm happy.

06:55.114 --> 06:59.141
- Oh!
- It's the Christmas hobgoblins!

07:01.988 --> 07:05.185
Ooh!

07:05.291 --> 07:07.282
What the hell is this?

07:07.393 --> 07:10.988
It's classic mirth-making, is what it is.

07:12.899 --> 07:17.461
# I will always be true #

07:17.570 --> 07:22.030
# Spend my days pitching woo to you #

07:22.141 --> 07:25.133
Oh! He's been singing
for two hours!

07:25.244 --> 07:27.644
This couldn't have less
to do with Christmas.

07:27.747 --> 07:29.908
And I think
that's a stagehand.

07:30.016 --> 07:34.009
#And I love you too #

07:34.120 --> 07:36.953
# I am you and you are you #

07:37.056 --> 07:41.652
# Oh, you and me together
you can see #

07:41.761 --> 07:45.197
Ha-ha!
Next time get a DVD!

07:45.298 --> 07:49.098
This <i>is</i> a DVD!

07:49.202 --> 07:51.363
<i>Well, you won't get to see</i>
<i>Santa's big sing-off...</i>

07:51.471 --> 07:54.702
but seeing as we're close
to the usual dismissal time-

07:54.807 --> 07:57.935
two, one- there it is.

07:58.044 --> 08:00.877
Take off and have a frank
and productive holiday.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.516
- Oh, dear God!
- <i>Principal Skinner!</i>

08:07.620 --> 08:09.315
We're snowed in!

08:10.890 --> 08:14.087
We're trapped in the school!

08:14.193 --> 08:17.185
We're gonna miss Christmas!

08:17.296 --> 08:21.232
I fixed the DVD.

08:25.204 --> 08:27.570
<i>Roads closed. Pipes frozen.</i>

08:27.673 --> 08:30.039
<i>Albinos virtually invisible.</i>

08:30.142 --> 08:32.508
The Weather Service has upgraded
Springfield's blizzard...

08:32.611 --> 08:36.070
from winter wonderland
to a class-three kill storm.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.707
I don't like the sound
of that "class-three."

08:38.818 --> 08:40.876
And where are
the city's snowplows?

08:40.986 --> 08:43.352
Sold off to billionaire
Montgomery Burns...

08:43.456 --> 08:46.016
<i>in a veritable orgasm of poor planning.</i>

08:46.125 --> 08:49.458
- He shoots! He scores!
- Perfect form, sir.

08:49.562 --> 08:52.827
This is terrible!
How will the kids get home?

08:52.932 --> 08:54.763
I don't know.
Internet?

08:57.937 --> 08:59.837
Children, it seems
the phone lines are down...

08:59.939 --> 09:01.907
so I'm afraid we're stuck
here for the duration.

09:02.008 --> 09:04.875
- Aww!
- But it's my kid's birthday.

09:04.977 --> 09:08.174
I'm doing a puzzle with Grandmama,
and she'll finish without me.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.841
Yes, yes, yes.
We all had plans.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.180
Except for me, ironically.
I'm right where I want to be.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.720
I can cut a trail through the snow.
I'm part Eskimo.

09:15.821 --> 09:19.552
I don't care if you're Kristi Yamaguchi.
No one leaves the building.

09:19.659 --> 09:22.787
This stinks. We'll miss the <i>Itchy and Scratchy</i>
where they finally kiss.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.956
I don't care if they're kissing
Kristi Yamaguchi. You're not going home!

09:27.066 --> 09:30.229
- That's so unfair!
- This blows.

09:30.336 --> 09:32.566
Skinner's the real Grinch!

09:33.940 --> 09:37.137
I'm all for rescuing the kids...

09:37.243 --> 09:39.905
but I wish you hadn't
sawed off my roof.

09:40.012 --> 09:43.345
My car, your roof.
It's only fair.

09:43.449 --> 09:46.213
- B- But it's my car.
- Well, yeah.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.584
Hey, whatever happened to the plow
from your old snowplow business?

09:49.689 --> 09:53.648
- I never had a snowplow business.
- Sure, you did. "Mr. Plow."

09:53.759 --> 09:55.818
You're wearing the jacket
right now.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.488
I think I know
my own life, Ned.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.623
# Call Mr. Plow
That's my name #

10:00.733 --> 10:02.860
#That name again
is Mr. Plow #

10:04.704 --> 10:07.002
I'm so hungry.
I want more.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.006
You heard the principal.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.235
Everyone gets one apple
and a handful of relish!

10:15.114 --> 10:18.572
If you don't eat your relish,
you're not getting any mayonnaise.

10:18.684 --> 10:23.519
Screw this. The rest of you can stay here
like dorks, but I'm going home.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.488
Go, Nelson!

10:34.100 --> 10:37.866
Well, I hope you've all learned something
from Nelson's "headstrongedness."

10:37.970 --> 10:40.336
- And from now on-
- We want out!

10:40.439 --> 10:43.374
We want out!
We want out!

10:43.476 --> 10:47.469
- <i>We want out!</i>
- Yeesh! It's getting ugly out there.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.481
Mmm.
Think, Skinner, think.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.609
What would
Superintendent Chalmers do?

10:53.719 --> 10:56.153
- Skinner!
- Eh, that's no help.

10:56.255 --> 11:00.385
Mmm. Ah!
My old footlocker.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.257
Back in 'Nam,
I could command respect.

11:05.731 --> 11:08.859
Sarge, let's make a break for it while
the guards are partying with Jane Fonda.

11:08.968 --> 11:12.961
Nope. Too dangerous. We're all gonna
sit tight and reminisce about candy bars.

11:13.072 --> 11:16.872
Uh, well, uh, one time, I'm
eating a candy bar at the beach...

11:16.976 --> 11:20.377
- and a girl starts taking off her bathing suit-
- Get back to the candy bar!

11:20.479 --> 11:23.141
The hell with this.
I'm gettin' outta here!

11:23.249 --> 11:26.309
No, you fool!

11:30.456 --> 11:33.482
That elephant ate
my entire platoon.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.719
Well, I'm not gonna let it
happen again!

11:38.731 --> 11:41.029
Children, stand down!

11:41.133 --> 11:43.431
- Huh?
- I said, stand down!

11:46.005 --> 11:50.533
I'm not joking, people. From now on there will
be no talking out of turn or leaving this room.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.372
- <i>Willie?</i>
- Aye, sir!

11:52.478 --> 11:56.107
- <i>This sucks!</i>
- Are you questioning my authority?

11:56.215 --> 11:58.911
Willie!

11:59.018 --> 12:01.213
Ow! My vest.

12:01.320 --> 12:05.450
Don't just stand there. Fight back. There aren't
enough coat hooks to hold all of us!

12:05.558 --> 12:09.392
Actually there are. Five, 10, 15, 20-
Uh, can you two share a hook?

12:09.495 --> 12:11.258
- Yes, sir.
- We're fine then.

12:15.568 --> 12:20.505
- I think we hit something.
- I hope it's Flanders.

12:20.606 --> 12:23.769
I'm just kidding!
Hey, you're all right.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.648
Now, children, if you have to answer
nature's call during the night...

12:31.751 --> 12:34.276
- use this bucket next to Bart's head.
- Hey!

12:34.386 --> 12:36.320
All right. Lights out.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.220
I'm tired of taking orders from G.I. Jerk!

12:39.325 --> 12:41.350
- I'm gonna tunnel out of here!
- No, Bart.

12:41.460 --> 12:45.294
For all we know, hundreds of rescue workers
are digging us out right now.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.370
# I feel like making love #

12:58.477 --> 13:01.241
# Making love to you #

13:04.116 --> 13:06.346
Catchy song, all right.
You really wrote it?

13:06.452 --> 13:09.148
Yeah. As a tribute
to Princess Di.

13:09.255 --> 13:12.315
And Dodi. Because
these days, princesses-

13:14.860 --> 13:18.853
We're trapped!

13:25.271 --> 13:28.240
Mr. Army Man? I can't sleep
without my Reggie Rabbit.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.241
- Is that some sort of plush novelty?
- Yes, ma'am.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.641
Well, here's a scouring pad.
It's just as good.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.442
It's cold and hurt-y.

13:38.884 --> 13:41.785
Uh-What the-

13:43.122 --> 13:45.920
A tunnel!

13:46.025 --> 13:48.152
Bart's digging us out!

13:48.260 --> 13:52.219
- Not on my watch he's not!
- Oh, no!

13:52.331 --> 13:54.322
I know it looks like
the path to freedom.

13:54.433 --> 13:57.334
But one collapse, and presto-
you've got a snow casket.

13:57.436 --> 14:02.499
- I was gonna put buttresses in.
- Gonna, wanna, shoulda. Willie, destroy it.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.873
He did do
a bonny job, sir.

14:07.980 --> 14:12.883
Defying orders, eh? Well, I see
you Scotsmen are thrifty with courage too.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.885
Okay, Skinner.

14:14.987 --> 14:18.445
That's the last time
you'll slap your Willie around.

14:18.557 --> 14:22.049
- I quit!
- Fine. I'll do the job myself.

14:25.564 --> 14:27.725
Help!
It's caving in!

14:27.833 --> 14:31.701
- Oh!
- What's the problem, Seymour? Stuck?

14:31.804 --> 14:33.931
That's precisely the problem,
and you know it.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.599
- Now, get me out of here!
- What's that?

14:36.709 --> 14:39.906
- You want the pee bucket on your head?
- No! You're twisting my words!

14:46.785 --> 14:47.353
<i>Come on! We're taking over the school!</i>

14:47.353 --> 14:49.116
<i>Come on! We're taking over the school!</i>

14:49.221 --> 14:51.712
That's it!
Cinch it up around the neck.

14:51.824 --> 14:55.453
This is a gross misuse of school property.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.621
Where are the dodge balls? Ow!

14:58.731 --> 15:01.165
Ow! Ohh!

15:01.267 --> 15:03.098
All right.
That's it.

15:03.202 --> 15:06.296
I'm writing all your names on
the detention list in my mind.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.737
Silence, Seymour!
We're in charge now.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.832
Your reign
of fussiness is over.

15:10.943 --> 15:13.571
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>The school is now under kid control.</i>

15:13.679 --> 15:15.738
<i>You are hereby ordered</i>
<i>to go nuts!</i>

15:31.130 --> 15:32.757
Huh?

15:34.833 --> 15:37.927
Aw, stupid ice!

15:38.037 --> 15:40.505
I always knew I would die
caked in something.

15:40.606 --> 15:44.303
Well, better turn off that engine
before those fumes put us in tombs.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.537
Wait. Let's just
leave it on...

15:46.645 --> 15:48.545
till we forget
our troubles.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.842
Mm, sounds like a plan.

15:53.252 --> 15:56.813
I can't write this.
It's a grammatical nightmare.

15:56.922 --> 15:59.914
- <i>Mau! Didi mau!</i>
- I'm getting a cramp in my wrist!

16:00.025 --> 16:02.653
Oh, boo-hoo.
After all the times I've done it...

16:02.761 --> 16:05.889
my wrist sounds like a cement mixer.

16:10.035 --> 16:12.230
- Ow!
- Come on, Seymour.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.329
- <i>Mau! Didi mau!</i>
- Ow!

16:14.440 --> 16:17.898
I told you no one can climb a rope.
It's physically impossible.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.979
What part of <i>didi mau</i>
don't you understand?

16:22.414 --> 16:25.281
Nelson, put that globe down!
Milhouse, stay out of my desk!

16:25.384 --> 16:27.477
Jimbo, that's my Princey Award!

16:27.586 --> 16:30.316
Quiet, Principal Spinner!

16:31.724 --> 16:33.521
Hey, I got Skinner's key card!

16:33.625 --> 16:35.991
We can finally see
our permanent records!

16:36.095 --> 16:38.757
<i>No! You can't go in there!</i>

16:41.633 --> 16:45.694
"Underachiever and proud of it."
How old is this thing?

16:45.804 --> 16:50.935
"Lisa is an outstanding student with a slight
tendency toward know-it-all-ism"?

16:51.043 --> 16:53.841
That's not even a word!

16:53.946 --> 16:56.380
Then we'll get rid
of the record permanently!

17:02.554 --> 17:04.784
Hey, look how much
Skinner makes.

17:04.890 --> 17:08.656
- Twenty-five thousand dollars a year!
- Wow!

17:08.761 --> 17:12.595
Let's see. He's 40 years old,
times 25 grand.

17:12.698 --> 17:16.429
- Whoa! He's a millionaire!
- Wow!

17:16.535 --> 17:18.560
I wasn't a principal
when I was one!

17:18.670 --> 17:21.263
Plus, in the summer,
he paints houses!

17:21.373 --> 17:24.536
- He's a billionaire!
- Wow!

17:24.643 --> 17:27.237
If I were a billionaire,
why would I be living with my mother?

17:29.248 --> 17:31.580
Oh, they're just not responding
to logic anymore.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.844
I'll never win this alone.

17:33.952 --> 17:35.783
There's only one guy
who can help me now.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.084
Look! I'm throwing paper!

17:50.269 --> 17:52.965
<i>You're my only hope,</i>
<i>Nibbles.</i>

17:59.945 --> 18:02.641
Godspeed, Nibbles.
Godspeed.

18:04.216 --> 18:06.650
Aw, nuts.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.882
There you are! Falcon to Eagle.
Have located bag of crap.

18:10.989 --> 18:14.857
If you get me out of this, there's a hall monitor
position coming open in the spring.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.623
- I spit on your monitors!
- I know. That's why the position's available.

18:22.201 --> 18:24.533
Huh?

18:24.636 --> 18:27.901
Marvelous! Marvelous!

18:28.006 --> 18:32.136
Enough! I grow weary
of your sexually suggestive dancing.

18:32.244 --> 18:34.405
Bring me my ranch dressing hose!

18:41.553 --> 18:44.078
Homer? Homer!

18:44.189 --> 18:48.888
- Homer, wake up! The car's filling with-
- I know. Ranch dressing.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.320
A hamster ball!

18:52.431 --> 18:54.865
Just like the one that saved Ezekiel!

18:57.035 --> 19:00.027
We're free!
And we've got something to eat!

19:06.645 --> 19:09.580
- Whoo-hoo!
- Now, let's go save those kids!

19:09.681 --> 19:13.276
You're the camel!
Hey, this car's got cruise control.

19:13.385 --> 19:17.219
School, please.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.916
Homer, that's not how it-

19:23.829 --> 19:26.059
It's happening.
My horoscope was right!

19:29.201 --> 19:33.661
So long, <i>Johnny Tremain.</i>
Your Newberry Award won't save you now!

19:33.772 --> 19:37.003
Not <i>Huck Finn!</i> I spent hours
crossing out the sass-back!

19:37.109 --> 19:40.272
- We're gonna crash!
- Do you have air bags?

19:40.379 --> 19:42.847
No! The church opposes them
for some reason!

19:54.826 --> 19:58.023
- What was that?
- It sounded like a silo tipping over.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.758
Look!
The snow's melting!

20:05.504 --> 20:09.406
With a little help from our friend,
sodium chloride!

20:17.849 --> 20:20.818
Dad!

20:24.456 --> 20:29.894
You did it, Nibbles!
Now, chew through my ball sack.

20:29.995 --> 20:32.054
Huh?

20:32.164 --> 20:34.962
- Skinner!
- Oh! Superintendent Chalmers!

20:35.067 --> 20:38.093
What are you doing in that
ridiculous duffel, Seymour?

20:38.203 --> 20:40.728
And is that burning
literature I smell?

20:40.839 --> 20:43.467
Uh-
W-W-Well, sir, I, uh-

20:43.575 --> 20:47.102
There'd better be a good
explanation for this.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.976
- There is, sir.
- Ah! Then I'm happy.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.484
Bart, if there's one thing
I'm good at...

20:54.586 --> 20:56.816
it's pretending
things didn't happen.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.753
And I think
this is one of those.

20:58.857 --> 21:01.121
- One of which?
- Exactly.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.786
No, seriously.
I wasn't listening.

21:03.895 --> 21:06.762
- One of those situations where-
- Gotcha!

21:08.600 --> 21:12.764
Come on, kids. Let's leave this
awful place and never come back.

21:14.239 --> 21:18.573
Boy, that salt really ate through the car.

21:18.677 --> 21:21.646
- And the exhaust pipe is leaking.
- Wha-

21:21.747 --> 21:26.480
And furthermore-

21:26.585 --> 21:29.110
Ignore her, Effendi.
We have each other.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.621
- Oh, baby.
- Aah!

21:33.025 --> 21:35.152
No use struggling,
my beloved Shelamela.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.285
Merry Christmas
from the Simpsons!

22:24.776 --> 22:26.801
Shh!
