00:06.507 --> 00:08.551
<i>Previously</i> on Batman Beyond...

00:08.926 --> 00:11.637
<i>I asked you here, Warren,
to clear up any misconceptions</i>

00:11.721 --> 00:14.599
<i>you might have gotten
from that incident with Mr. Tully.</i>

00:14.849 --> 00:16.934
<i>Harry simply suffered
an allergic reaction</i>

00:17.018 --> 00:19.312
<i>to a chemical compound in the lab.</i>

00:21.731 --> 00:22.731
Oh, Warren.

00:23.149 --> 00:26.277
There seems to be a file missing
from Harry's records.

00:26.611 --> 00:27.778
Would you know where it is?

00:33.993 --> 00:36.787
Leave him alone.
And get off my property.

00:39.290 --> 00:40.333
My medicine.

00:41.292 --> 00:42.627
At the house.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.216
Dad?

00:50.593 --> 00:51.844
Oh, my God.

00:53.304 --> 00:55.973
Listen to me.
Something stinks in your company.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.060
I think it cost my old man his life.

00:59.143 --> 01:00.811
The answer's on this.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.011
It's worse than I thought.

02:15.094 --> 02:17.638
It's some kind of new DNA mutagen.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.057
Powers is making nerve gas.

02:20.641 --> 02:24.312
He's using my company
to make nerve gas.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.774
- Stay away from that.
- Synaptic controls.

02:28.858 --> 02:31.861
Neuromuscular amplification,
flight capability. Hmph.

02:32.111 --> 02:34.280
This thing might be old,
but it's still cuttin' edge.

02:34.572 --> 02:36.699
I bet it amplifies your strength
by at least 10 to 1.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.659
I told you not to touch it!

02:38.743 --> 02:40.369
- But, aren't you gonna go to-
- No!

02:40.453 --> 02:41.996
You built that company,

02:42.079 --> 02:43.679
and now Powers
is making nerve gas there!

02:43.706 --> 02:45.124
You gotta do somethin'!

02:45.291 --> 02:46.292
You're Batman.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.960
I was Batman.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.046
Give this to
Commissioner Barbara Gordon.

02:50.129 --> 02:52.465
- Tell her I sent you.
- The cops?

02:52.548 --> 02:54.216
- They'll never be able to-
- Do it!

02:57.303 --> 02:58.783
Something happened to you, didn't it?

02:59.055 --> 03:00.556
And it wasn't just that you got old.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.660
Hey!

03:27.416 --> 03:28.417
Oops!

03:31.962 --> 03:34.673
Hello, Terry.
Ever had a ride in a limo?

03:35.174 --> 03:37.551
My dad always told me
to never take rides from strangers.

03:37.635 --> 03:39.178
Who is a stranger?

03:39.553 --> 03:42.681
Besides, your dad's not around anymore.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.603
Be smart, Terry. Get in.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.397
IWipass.

03:50.106 --> 03:51.690
Let go of me! What are you doin'?

03:51.774 --> 03:53.567
You some kinda sicko?

03:53.651 --> 03:55.653
Help! Help!

03:55.736 --> 03:58.864
That won't do you any good, Terry.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.467
Why don't you make it easy on yourself

04:00.491 --> 04:02.618
and give me back my disc.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.786
What disc?

04:03.869 --> 04:06.080
You know what I'm talking about.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.623
All right.

04:07.706 --> 04:08.874
If he lets go.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.260
Happy?

04:32.481 --> 04:33.566
Enough!

04:36.652 --> 04:38.487
Well, at least I've got the evidence.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.124
<i>Gotham</i> rolled out
the red carpet <i>today</i>

04:50.207 --> 04:53.544
<i>for Kasnian Minister of Commerce,
Vilmos Egans.</i>

04:53.627 --> 04:56.922
<i>Mr. Egans is here to take part
in the World Trade confab</i>

04:57.006 --> 04:58.507
<i>and was greeted by no less than</i>

04:58.591 --> 05:01.385
<i>Wayne-Powers CEO, Derek Powers.</i>

05:23.699 --> 05:25.743
What is it? What's the matter, boy?

06:12.456 --> 06:13.456
Whoa.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.268
Better.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.988
It's the ultimate
in germ warfare.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.741
A viral mutagen so quick-acting
and completely invasive,

06:47.825 --> 06:50.035
no living cell can resist it.

06:50.286 --> 06:52.871
It all began with experiments on plants.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.839
Impressive.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.924
But we're looking to do more
than wipe out

07:04.008 --> 07:06.594
our enemies' crops, Mr. Powers.

07:06.677 --> 07:07.677
Keep watching.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.599
This was our first experiment
with livestock.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.529
<i>I trust</i> the <i>film puts</i> to <i>rest</i>

07:25.613 --> 07:28.115
<i>any lingering doubts, Mr. Egans.</i>

07:28.198 --> 07:30.075
<i>As you can see,
the results are the same.</i>

07:30.159 --> 07:33.662
- Even with animals.
- And humans?

07:33.746 --> 07:35.873
You've tested it on them, too?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.584
The laws here aren't as liberal
about that sort of thing

07:38.667 --> 07:40.336
as they are in your country,

07:40.419 --> 07:43.130
but we did have a little accident.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.050
One of my workers. Terrible thing.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.218
There was a gas leak in his lab.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.139
This is what he looked like
the next day.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.515
Two hours later.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.684
An hour after that.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.354
There is no cure?

07:58.437 --> 08:00.898
Extreme heat or radiation

08:00.981 --> 08:03.442
but at this stage,
it's obviously not an option.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.739
Dust to dust.

08:11.950 --> 08:15.120
Consider what a real dose
of this gas could do to those

08:15.204 --> 08:18.749
six armored divisions your neighbors
keep on your border.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.832
Gone.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.004
In a matter of hours.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.386
Delivery. It's in progress?

08:30.886 --> 08:33.681
My men are loading
the cannisters as we speak.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.641
They leave tonight on hover transport.

08:35.724 --> 08:39.311
My assistant, Mr. Fixx,
will personally supervise the shipment.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.482
Excellent.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.527
Good-bye, Mr. Powers.
I will see you again, soon.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.570
Ihope.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.739
Yes, soon!

08:53.992 --> 08:56.328
Mr. Fixx, any word on the kid?

08:56.745 --> 08:58.414
Not yet, but they're looking.

08:58.497 --> 08:59.915
I don't have to tell you

08:59.998 --> 09:03.001
how important this deal
is to Wayne-Powers.

09:03.085 --> 09:06.130
It's going to open up
the entire Eastern bloc for us,

09:06.213 --> 09:09.466
so I don't need it spoiled
by a snot-nosed punk.

09:12.136 --> 09:14.805
I took care of his old man, didn't I?

09:20.394 --> 09:21.729
Little early for Halloween.

09:23.439 --> 09:25.315
But just in time for fall.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.367
Hit the alarms!

09:39.997 --> 09:41.665
It's Powers! What's going on?

09:43.375 --> 09:44.501
Batman?

09:45.085 --> 09:47.504
Or some guy dressed like him.
We're cutting him off.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.672
Shouldn't be a problem.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.175
Batman.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.352
<i>McGinnis? Can you hear me?</i>

10:02.770 --> 10:04.938
- Who... Who's that?
<i>- It's</i> Wayne.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.983
Mr. Wayne? Where are you?

10:08.066 --> 10:09.943
<i>In the radio receiver
in your cowl.</i>

10:12.196 --> 10:14.072
Now, listen to me, McGinnis.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.992
I want that suit back and I want it now.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.328
Uh... Now is not a good time.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.540
<i>That suit is not yours!</i>

10:24.833 --> 10:25.876
<i>You had no right!</i>

10:25.959 --> 10:27.503
Somebody had to do something.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.963
<i>- You sure weren't about to.</i>
- I'm warning you.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.604
He's over there! Over there!

10:57.032 --> 10:59.284
This suit works even better
than I thought it would.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.662
<i>This is your last chance.
Better take it.</i>

11:02.955 --> 11:04.248
No, thanks.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.084
Havin' too much fun.

11:08.544 --> 11:09.753
Fun, huh?

11:23.976 --> 11:25.269
He's mine!

11:32.526 --> 11:35.904
Hey, I can't move. What'd you do?

11:35.988 --> 11:38.490
<i>It's a fail-safe device.
Paralyses the suit.</i>

11:38.949 --> 11:41.159
<i>In case the wrong person gets into it.</i>

11:41.243 --> 11:43.078
- But, you can't!
<i>- I just did.</i>

11:44.663 --> 11:46.456
Hey! Hey!

11:52.921 --> 11:54.882
Come on. You gotta help me.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.903
Out of the way!

12:18.155 --> 12:20.115
Wayne, they're gonna kill me.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.542
Yeah!

12:51.396 --> 12:53.482
<i>McGinnis, I gave you a break.</i>

12:54.066 --> 12:55.525
<i>Now, bring that suit back.</i>

12:55.609 --> 12:57.986
Love to, but I got these guards
all over me.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.656
There's a broom closet
on the north wall.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.991
- Can you get to it?
<i>- A broom closet?</i>

13:03.075 --> 13:04.075
Do it!

13:15.087 --> 13:17.714
Now, I'm a sitting duck.
Hope you're happy.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.342
<i>The far wall.
Put your hand against it.</i>

13:23.053 --> 13:24.053
<i>Press hard.</i>

13:35.732 --> 13:38.318
- Cool.
<i>- I built the place, remember?</i>

13:38.402 --> 13:39.462
Then you'd now, where they'll be loading

13:39.486 --> 13:40.797
the hover transport, wouldn't you?

13:40.821 --> 13:42.823
<i>Forget it.
You're coming back here.</i>

13:42.906 --> 13:45.283
Powers is shipping out
the virus tonight!

13:45.534 --> 13:47.619
- It's got to be stopped!
<i>- I 7! call</i> the <i>police.</i>

13:47.703 --> 13:49.955
<i>- Let them handle it.
- I can do it.</i>

13:50.080 --> 13:52.290
I'II shut down the suit again.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.167
And this time, it'll be for good.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.003
<i>I read up on you, Mr. Wayne.</i>

13:56.670 --> 13:58.171
I know how you lost your folks.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.300
<i>The guy who murdered my dad
is on that transport.</i>

14:03.343 --> 14:05.387
<i>This is my one chance to nail him.</i>

14:14.229 --> 14:16.064
<i>The Hover Pads are
in the North-East Sector.</i>

14:18.984 --> 14:20.485
Wish me luck.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.947
Good luck.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.234
You said he wouldn't be a problem.

15:01.318 --> 15:02.944
Well, deal With it.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.739
- Almost done loading.
- The sooner the better.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.616
They haven't found our trespasser yet,

15:07.699 --> 15:08.926
and I don't want him interfering.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.619
Hey, look! There he is!

15:26.593 --> 15:29.471
You're out of business. As of now.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.139
And as for you, Fixx.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.100
I'm taking you in for the murder of...

15:39.439 --> 15:41.942
Get that hovercraft into the air!

16:05.048 --> 16:06.466
Shut the cargo doors!

16:12.973 --> 16:14.474
Like shooting skeet.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.614
No.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.241
No!

16:49.259 --> 16:50.259
Help me.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.053
Help me!

17:47.025 --> 17:48.526
You're pretty strong

17:48.610 --> 17:51.196
for some clown who thinks he's Batman.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.156
I am Batman.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.371
Terry? Honey?

18:42.289 --> 18:43.999
- What...
- Quick, get dressed.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.459
- We have company.
- Company?

18:47.335 --> 18:49.337
Mr. Bruce Wayne. He's here to see you.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.385
I hope you don't mind milk,
we're out of cream.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.178
I prefer it.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.889
Terence. Sorry, to get you up so early.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.140
It's okay.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.187
You never told me you knew Bruce Wayne.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.694
Well, actually, I...

19:12.777 --> 19:14.279
Why, I owe this boy my life.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.782
He defended me
against a bunch of hooligans once.

19:17.866 --> 19:21.578
I tried to reward him,
but he absolutely refused.

19:22.037 --> 19:24.080
Mr. Wayne wants to offer you a job.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.958
- A job?
- It's not much, mind you.

19:27.542 --> 19:31.171
I find that in my old age,
I could use a part-time assistant.

19:31.379 --> 19:34.174
You know, a gofer.
Go for this, go for that.

19:34.466 --> 19:36.593
An ally as it were.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.844
Would you be interested?

19:37.927 --> 19:40.138
Of course he would.
Wouldn't you, honey?

19:40.221 --> 19:42.599
I mean, to work with someone
as famous as Mr. Wayne.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.725
Sure.

19:44.434 --> 19:47.854
I warn you.
I can be a difficult taskmaster.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.982
I accept nothing short of excellence
from all who work for me.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.734
I think I can handle it.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.861
Very good then, Mr. McGinnis.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.654
Welcome to my world.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.429
The good news is, the radiation

20:21.513 --> 20:23.807
seems to have completely
eradicated the virus.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.934
What's the bad news?

20:30.188 --> 20:32.440
As you know,
the mutational properties of the virus

20:32.524 --> 20:35.610
can be corrupted by its environment.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.445
Bottom line it, Doctor.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.032
Kill the radiation, please.
