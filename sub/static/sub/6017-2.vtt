00:02.135 --> 00:04.763
There's no way
that moving in with your parents...

00:06.339 --> 00:09.001
...is a sign that your life
is right on track.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.405
There's no way
that you could fake this even.

00:11.578 --> 00:14.376
"Things are great.
I met a terrific girl, I got a great job...

00:14.547 --> 00:16.913
...and if everything goes
according to plan...

00:17.083 --> 00:20.644
...I'm gonna be moving back in
with my parents soon."

00:21.955 --> 00:24.082
It's like getting busted
on a parole violation...

00:24.257 --> 00:26.122
...and thrown back
into the slammer.

00:26.292 --> 00:30.092
"In the opinion of the board, you
need further rehabilitation, I'm afraid."

00:30.997 --> 00:34.262
And you go back into that little room
of yours, you feel so huge.

00:34.434 --> 00:37.460
It's like you could take your bed
and just crush it in your hands.

00:37.637 --> 00:39.798
You can hold your parents
between your fingers.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.533
"Why was I so afraid of you people
when I was growing up?"

00:47.580 --> 00:50.344
-I can't believe this.
-It won't be for that long.

00:50.517 --> 00:53.350
How can I do this? How can I
move back in with those people?

00:53.520 --> 00:55.715
Please, tell me.
They're insane, you know that.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.050
Hey, my parents are
as crazy as your parents.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.158
How can you compare
your parents to mine?

01:00.326 --> 01:04.387
My father has never
thrown anything out ever.

01:05.532 --> 01:10.128
My father wears his sneakers
in the pool. Sneakers.

01:10.303 --> 01:14.239
My mother has never set foot
in a natural body of water.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.168
Listen carefully.

01:20.313 --> 01:22.577
My mother has never laughed.

01:22.749 --> 01:28.016
Ever. Not a giggle,
not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.

01:28.188 --> 01:30.748
Never went, "Ha."

01:30.924 --> 01:33.085
-A smirk?
-Maybe.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.456
-And I'm moving back in there.
-I'll lend you the money for the rent.

01:36.629 --> 01:39.655
No, no, no. Borrowing money
from a friend is like having sex.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.824
It just completely changes
the relationship.

01:44.003 --> 01:45.834
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:46.005 --> 01:47.438
All right, I'm ready.

01:47.607 --> 01:51.270
I still don't understand. Why do you
want to move back with your parents?

01:51.444 --> 01:55.642
I don't want to. I'm out of money.
I got $714 in the bank.

01:55.815 --> 01:58.807
-Well, move in here.
-What's that?

01:59.686 --> 02:01.449
Why doesn't he just move in here?

02:01.621 --> 02:04.613
Yeah, I'll move in with him.
He doesn't let you use the toilet.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.123
You can move in with me
if you want.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.727
Thank you. I...

02:11.898 --> 02:14.093
That might not work out.

02:16.169 --> 02:20.765
Careful. Careful with the suitcases.
We just painted.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.033
-Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
-Hello, Kramer.

02:23.209 --> 02:25.234
-Close the door.
-I gotta bring in more stuff.

02:25.411 --> 02:28.505
-More stuff? How much is there?
-There's more.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.407
-So how are you, Jerry?
-Fine, Mrs. Costanza.

02:32.585 --> 02:36.578
-Hey, I got a terrific joke for you.
-I'm not interested.

02:38.191 --> 02:39.954
No, no. It's really funny.

02:40.126 --> 02:43.061
-There's these two guy...
-Tell it to the audience.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.590
Here, I made some
bologna sandwiches.

02:46.766 --> 02:48.791
Bologna? Nobody eats
bologna anymore.

02:48.968 --> 02:51.436
What are you talking about?
Have a sandwich.

02:51.604 --> 02:53.902
-No, thanks.
-Oh, stop it.

02:54.073 --> 02:56.940
-You don't want one, Kramer?
-No, thanks.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.442
I think you're all
a little touched in the head.

02:59.612 --> 03:02.513
You're so worried about your health?
You're young men.

03:02.682 --> 03:06.174
-I really don't eat it.
-What will I do with these sandwiches?

03:06.352 --> 03:09.446
Will you take them home, give them
to someone in your building?

03:11.057 --> 03:15.255
I don't feel comfortable handing out
bologna sandwiches in the building.

03:15.428 --> 03:19.091
-All right. That's it. Anything else?
-No, that's it.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.063
-I gotta go move the car.
-Well, I guess we'll be going.

03:24.837 --> 03:27.135
-What, you're going?
-Yeah.

03:29.475 --> 03:31.705
Well, what are you doing later?

03:31.878 --> 03:34.278
Elaine and I are having dinner
with Kramer and his new girlfriend.

03:34.447 --> 03:36.472
-Really?
-Yeah. You can't believe this woman.

03:36.649 --> 03:39.243
She's one of these low-talkers.
You can't hear a word.

03:39.419 --> 03:42.081
You're always going,
"Excuse me? What was that?"

03:42.255 --> 03:44.246
-Maybe I'll meet you.
-No, George.

03:44.424 --> 03:47.723
We're going out to eat tonight
with your father.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.328
Okay.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.899
-I'll talk to you later.
-Yeah, take it easy.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.074

04:06.279 --> 04:08.474
Oh, my God.

04:12.819 --> 04:15.845
-Yeah?
-I had this idea for a pizza place...

04:16.022 --> 04:18.649
...where you make your own pie.
-Right.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.452
-You remember?
-That was a good one.

04:20.627 --> 04:22.151
Well...

04:26.132 --> 04:27.360
-What's that?
-Excuse me?

04:32.939 --> 04:35.169
-Yeah? Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.602
You know that Leslie's
in the clothing business?

04:40.780 --> 04:42.042
She's a designer.

04:42.215 --> 04:45.912
She's come up with a new one that'll
be the big new look in men's fashions.

04:46.085 --> 04:48.747
It's, like, a puffy shirt.

04:48.921 --> 04:51.583
Well, yeah, it's all puffy.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.123
Like the pirates used to wear.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.093
-Oh, a puffy shirt.
-Puffy.

04:56.262 --> 05:00.028
Yeah. See, I think people
wanna look like pirates.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.530
It's the right time for it.

05:01.701 --> 05:05.535
To be all puffy
and devil-may-care, you know.

05:07.407 --> 05:08.669
Yeah.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.809
That's true.

05:16.215 --> 05:19.048
I'll be right back.

05:28.194 --> 05:30.389
Jerry's gonna be
on the <i>Today</i> show on Friday.

05:30.563 --> 05:34.226
-Yeah, that's right.
-Yep. He's promoting...

05:34.400 --> 05:35.924
...a benefit for Goodwill.

05:36.102 --> 05:39.503
You know, they clothe the poor
and the homeless.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.537
-And the indigent.
-And the indigent, yeah.

05:41.708 --> 05:46.008
I do volunteer work for them. I set the
whole thing up and got Jerry to do it.

05:51.617 --> 05:53.312
-Sure. Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.181
Yeah. Yep.

05:59.392 --> 06:00.882
Yep.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.560
Yep, yep.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.925
Maybe you should take
a civil-service test.

06:08.101 --> 06:12.367
-I'm not taking a civil-service test.
-Look at this, George.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.062
You ever seen a silver dollar?

06:15.007 --> 06:16.804
Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.

06:16.976 --> 06:18.967
Why don't you wanna take
a civil-service test?

06:19.145 --> 06:22.239
To do what? Work in the post office?
Is that what you want me to do?

06:22.415 --> 06:27.876
Would you believe when I was 18
I had a silver-dollar collection?

06:29.088 --> 06:31.784
I don't understand.
You get job security.

06:31.958 --> 06:35.155
-You get a paycheck every week.
-I'm a college graduate.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.727
You want me to be a mailman?

06:36.896 --> 06:40.093
You know, I couldn't bring myself
to spend one of these.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.700
I got some kind of a...

06:42.869 --> 06:44.268
...phobia.

06:47.306 --> 06:49.797
-So, what are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

06:49.976 --> 06:53.343
I do know that I have some kind
of a talent, something to offer.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.242
I just don't know what it is yet.

06:55.415 --> 07:00.751
I bet that collection would be worth
a lot of money today.

07:05.024 --> 07:07.185
Oh, my God.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.859
I don't like this waiter.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.864
Look at him.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.294
He sees us.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.665
Doesn't wanna come over.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.168
I need some air.

07:23.676 --> 07:27.874
-George, where you going?
-I got a lot of thinking to do.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.510
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.916
Look what you've done.
You've spilled my bag.

07:36.088 --> 07:38.283
-Here, let me help you.
-No, no. It's all right.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.949
It's just that I'm here
with my parents...

07:41.127 --> 07:43.652
...and my mother wants me to take
a civil-service test...

07:43.830 --> 07:46.856
...and to tell you the truth,
I don't even think I'd pass it.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.558
What?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.868
-Your hands.
-What about them?

07:56.976 --> 07:59.206
They're quite exquisite.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.707
They are?

08:01.881 --> 08:04.213
Extraordinary.

08:04.383 --> 08:06.476
Have you ever done
any hand modeling?

08:07.119 --> 08:09.246
Hand modeling? No.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.780
Here's my card.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.550
Why don't you...

08:13.726 --> 08:15.717
...give me a call?

08:23.970 --> 08:25.198
I don't get it.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.000
Me neither.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.540
-What is it?
-I don't know.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.337
-They're hands.
-This woman set me up for a job.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.844
Well, what about my hands?

08:35.014 --> 08:37.744
I don't see how your hands
are any better than my hands.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.407
What, are you kidding?

08:39.585 --> 08:41.985
The knuckles
are all out of proportion.

08:42.154 --> 08:45.521
You got hair there. Where do you
get off comparing your hands to mine?

08:46.425 --> 08:48.689
This is a one-in-a-million hand.

08:49.395 --> 08:53.024
That's what comes from avoiding
manual labor your whole life.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.899
This is it.
It's happened to me, Jerry.

08:58.070 --> 09:01.836
I was sitting in the restaurant,
the two nutjobs were talking.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.339
I couldn't take it anymore.

09:03.509 --> 09:06.034
I get up from the table,
and... I bop into this woman.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.873
It's just like in the movies.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.281
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:10.783 --> 09:13.479
-Hey, George.
-Hey.

09:14.587 --> 09:17.385
-Are you crazy?! Are you crazy?!
-What? What?

09:17.557 --> 09:21.755
-You could've damaged my hands!
-What? It's just a toy.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.896
George has become a hand model.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.894
-A hand model?
-Yes.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.556
Really? Let me see your hands.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.726
You can look at them,
but do not touch them.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.303
Let's see.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.976
Oh, those are nice.

09:39.145 --> 09:41.340
You know,
I never noticed this before.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.072
They're smooth.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.739
Creamy.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.080
Delicate yet masculine.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.586
All right. I gotta get going.

09:53.659 --> 09:54.921
Oven mitts?

09:57.897 --> 09:59.956
It's all I could find.

10:00.866 --> 10:04.029
-Would you mind getting the door?
-All right.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.996
-Thank you very much.
-Yep.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.611
You won't believe
what's up with Leslie.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.339
Since you agreed to wear
the puffy shirt on <i>Today</i>...

10:16.515 --> 10:20.144
...she's getting all these orders
from boutiques and department stores.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.452
Since I what?

10:24.390 --> 10:27.655
-Agreed to wear the puffy shirt.
-What are you talking about?

10:28.227 --> 10:32.061
You said that you would agree to wear
the puffy shirt on the <i>Today</i> show.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.533
-This?
-Yeah.

10:46.746 --> 10:49.738
-I agreed to wear this?
-Yeah, yeah.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.011
Well, when did I do that?

10:52.251 --> 10:54.378
When we went to dinner
the other night.

10:54.553 --> 10:56.714
What, are you crazy?

10:57.189 --> 10:59.657
What were you talking about
when I went to the bathroom?

10:59.825 --> 11:02.157
I don't know.
I couldn't understand a word she said.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.319
-I was just nodding.
-There you go.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.462
Where I go?

11:06.632 --> 11:09.362
You mean she was asking me
to wear this ridiculous shirt...

11:09.535 --> 11:13.062
...on national TV, and I said yes?
-Yes, yes. You said it.

11:13.239 --> 11:16.003
I didn't know what she was
talking about. I couldn't hear her.

11:16.175 --> 11:21.010
-Well, she asked you.
-I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.512
I mean, look at it. It looks ridiculous.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.506
Well, you gotta wear it now.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.243
All those stores are stocking it...

11:27.420 --> 11:29.854
...based on the condition
you'll wear this on the show.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.684
The factory in New Jersey
is already making them.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.292
They're making these?

11:35.461 --> 11:36.951
Yes, yes.

11:37.129 --> 11:39.222
This pirate trend
she's come up with, Jerry...

11:39.398 --> 11:41.298
This is gonna be
the new look for the '90s.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.298
You're gonna be the first pirate.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.903
But I don't wanna be a pirate.

11:50.843 --> 11:55.212
I knew it. I knew it. I always knew
you had beautiful hands.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.609
I used to tell people...

11:56.782 --> 11:59.410
Frank, didn't I use to
talk about his hands?

11:59.585 --> 12:02.076
Who the hell did you ever
mention his hands to?

12:02.254 --> 12:04.119
I mentioned his hands
to plenty of people.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.655
You never mentioned them to me.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.359
Hand me an emery board.

12:10.930 --> 12:15.629
I always talk about your hands,
how they're so soft and milky white.

12:15.801 --> 12:19.794
-No, you never said milky white.
-I said milky white!

12:23.909 --> 12:25.809
Scissor.

12:27.613 --> 12:30.446
Don't hand them to me
with the point facing out!

12:30.616 --> 12:32.311
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

12:32.485 --> 12:35.454
I'll try to be more careful.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.420
I hope so.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.925
Georgie...

12:45.631 --> 12:48.657
Georgie, would you like
some Jell-O?

12:48.834 --> 12:51.268
Why'd you put
the bananas in there?

12:51.437 --> 12:54.964
-George likes the bananas!
-So let him have bananas on the side!

12:55.141 --> 12:59.737
All right, please. Please,
I cannot have this constant bickering.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.375
Stress is very damaging
to the epidermis.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.912
I have an important
photo session in the morning.

13:08.087 --> 13:10.214
My hands have got to be
in tiptop shape.

13:10.389 --> 13:13.847
So, please, keep the television down
and the conversation to a minimum.

13:14.360 --> 13:18.160
But, Georgie,
what about the Jell-O?

13:19.231 --> 13:20.459
I'll take it in my room.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.303
Yeah, come in.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.465
Wanted to let you know
he's got five minutes.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.372
Yep, yep.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.737
Jerry, five minutes.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.920
Now, that's a great-looking shirt.

13:48.093 --> 13:51.221
Aye, captain. Yeah.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.991
See, I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.067
Look at it. It's fantastic.

13:57.236 --> 14:00.000
Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?
I can't wear this.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.902
Hey, this looks better
than anything you own.

14:03.075 --> 14:07.671
In two months' time, everybody's
gonna be wearing the pirate look.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.510
-Yeah.
-Hi, Kramer. I just saw Bryant Gumbel.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.621
-He said he might help at the benefit.
-Great.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.655
-What is that?
-It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, huh?

14:27.833 --> 14:29.767
What do you think?
Is it cool or what?

14:31.070 --> 14:34.233
-Why are you wearing this now?
-Why am I wearing it now?

14:34.406 --> 14:36.567
I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now.

14:36.742 --> 14:39.267
Because the low-talker
asked me to, that's why.

14:39.912 --> 14:44.144
And I said yes. Do you know why?
Because I couldn't hear her.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.950
When did she..?
When did she ask you this?

14:48.120 --> 14:50.213
At dinner,
when Kramer went to the bathroom.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.380
-I didn't hear anything.
-Of course not!

14:52.558 --> 14:55.220
Nobody hears anything
when this woman speaks.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.057
Well, you can't wear that
on the show.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.788
-Elaine, you wanna stop it?
-What..?

15:00.766 --> 15:03.257
What? No, Jerry,
you are promoting a benefit...

15:03.435 --> 15:07.565
...to clothe homeless people.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.802
You can't come out
dressed like that.

15:11.977 --> 15:14.207
You're all puffed up.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.412
You look like
the Count of Monte Cristo.

15:17.783 --> 15:20.308
I have to wear it.
The woman has orders for this shirt...

15:20.486 --> 15:22.477
...based on me wearing it on TV.
-Yeah.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.418
They're producing them
as we speak.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.582
Yeah, but you're supposed to be
a compassionate person...

15:27.760 --> 15:29.591
...that cares about poor people.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.925
You look like you're gonna swing in
on a chandelier.

15:37.569 --> 15:39.901
Okay, let's go.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.497
Is that what you're wearing?

15:44.977 --> 15:47.172
I've never seen
hands like these before.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.871
They're so soft and milky white.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.540
You know whose hands
they remind me of?

15:52.718 --> 15:55.983
Ray McKigney.

15:56.155 --> 15:57.952
-Ray.
-He was it.

15:58.524 --> 15:59.752
Who was he?

15:59.925 --> 16:01.984
The most exquisite hands
you've ever seen.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.526
Oh, he had it all.

16:04.196 --> 16:05.629
What happened to him?

16:10.302 --> 16:13.897
Tragic story, I'm afraid.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.667
He could've had
any woman in the world...

16:16.842 --> 16:20.539
...but none could match the beauty
of his own hand.

16:20.713 --> 16:24.444
And that became his one true love.

16:29.288 --> 16:32.348
-You mean...
-Yes.

16:32.524 --> 16:36.620
He was not master of his domain.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.290
-But how..?
-The muscles...

16:42.468 --> 16:45.062
...became so strained
with overuse...

16:45.237 --> 16:48.400
...that eventually the hand locked
into a deformed position...

16:48.574 --> 16:50.542
...and he was left
with nothing but a claw.

16:52.444 --> 16:55.004
He traveled the world
seeking a cure.

16:55.180 --> 16:59.310
Acupuncturists, herbalists, swamis.

16:59.485 --> 17:00.747
Nothing helped.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.185
Towards the end,
his hands became so frozen...

17:05.357 --> 17:07.290
...he was unable
to manipulate utensils...

17:07.459 --> 17:11.691
...and was dependent
on Cub Scouts to feed him.

17:11.997 --> 17:16.434
I hadn't seen another pair of hands
like Ray McKigney's until today.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.797
You are his successor.

17:18.971 --> 17:22.930
I only hope you have
a little more self-control.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.837
You don't have to worry about me.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.581
I won a contest.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.290
Okay, let's get to work.

17:44.696 --> 17:48.132
Back now, 7:46. On Tuesday
the 19th, here in New York...

17:48.300 --> 17:50.564
...there'll be a benefit
for Goodwill Industries...

17:50.736 --> 17:53.864
...a used-clothing organization
that provides services to the needy.

17:54.039 --> 17:56.166
One of the performers
will be Jerry Seinfeld.

17:56.341 --> 17:58.673
-Jerry, good morning.
-Thank you, Bryant.

17:58.844 --> 18:02.712
Speaking of clothing, that is a very,
very unusual shirt you have on.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.413
Yeah.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.247
You're all kind of...
Kind of puffed up.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.584
-Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
-You look kind of like a pirate.

18:14.359 --> 18:15.724
Like a pirate.

18:15.894 --> 18:19.386
Anyway, you know, we're hoping
to raise enough money...

18:19.565 --> 18:23.296
Do you know..? You know... Look,
I'm sorry, it is just a very unusual shirt.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.666
It could be a whole new look for you.
You could put a patch over an eye.

18:26.839 --> 18:30.673
-You could be the pirate comedian.
-Yeah.

18:31.543 --> 18:34.808
-Will you wear the puffy shirt at the..?
-Look, it's not my shirt.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.005
-Whose shirt is it?
-What's the difference?

18:37.182 --> 18:38.547
I agreed to wear it.

18:38.717 --> 18:41.914
It's a puffy shirt.
I feel ridiculous in it.

18:42.087 --> 18:45.682
I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever
seen, to be perfectly honest with you.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.122
You bastard!

18:48.627 --> 18:51.357
-Did you hear that?
-That I heard.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.434
All right, a little to the left.

18:56.602 --> 18:58.263
Little higher. Good, perfect.

18:58.437 --> 19:00.564
-Like that?
-Just like that. Hold it. Good.

19:00.739 --> 19:04.038
Okay, let me get one more.
One more. Good.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.109
That's it. You're done.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.007
-That's it?
-That's it.

19:08.180 --> 19:10.410
And here's your check.

19:10.582 --> 19:12.948
Thank you very much.
It was an honor.

19:13.118 --> 19:14.779
Thank you.

19:18.957 --> 19:22.484
It was great working with you.
Your hands are beautiful.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.064
Thank you very much.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.893
You know, I was wondering...

19:29.067 --> 19:32.434
...if you're not doing anything later,
maybe you'd like to get together.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.751
You ruined me!
You ruined my career!

19:46.919 --> 19:49.410
Oh, just keep your voice down,
everyone can hear you.

19:49.588 --> 19:50.987
Well, I don't give a damn!

19:51.156 --> 19:54.182
If you talked this loud to begin with,
I wouldn't be in this costume.

19:54.793 --> 19:57.853
Hey, hey. You can't believe this.
Look at this check.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.555
They said I had the most
beautiful hands they ever saw...

20:00.732 --> 20:04.725
...except for this McKigney guy. This
girl gave me her number. I got it all.

20:04.903 --> 20:06.632
I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting.

20:06.805 --> 20:09.000
I've never noticed your hands before,
let me see.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.039
All right.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.379
Yeah. Real nice.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.311
Nice shirt.

20:21.787 --> 20:24.517
What is this? Is this what
you wore on the show?

20:24.690 --> 20:27.818
-Yeah.
-Have you completely lost your mind?

20:27.993 --> 20:29.722
-Hey.
-Who's dressing you?

20:29.895 --> 20:32.125
You look like a complete idiot.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.662
I wouldn't wipe my...

20:42.507 --> 20:44.941
-You ready?
-Yeah.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.978
Hot, hot.

20:51.850 --> 20:56.116
-I'm sorry.
-McKigney had a few good years.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.316
How do you forget
to turn off an iron?

20:58.490 --> 21:01.050
I was excited Jerry was putting on
the puffy shirt.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.717
My whole life is ruined
because of the puffy shirt.

21:03.895 --> 21:07.797
It didn't do me any good either. That
benefit was the worst show I ever did.

21:07.966 --> 21:10.457
Some of those heckles
were really uncalled for.

21:10.636 --> 21:14.128
"Avast ye, matey"?
What the hell does that mean?

21:14.306 --> 21:16.103
"Twenty degrees
off the starboard side.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.176
It's a Spanish galleon."
There's no comeback for that.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.836
Well, it got me fired
from the benefit committee.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.848
You know, all those stores
canceled out on her.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.508
She's finished.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.916
-We're finished.
-Really? What happened?

21:30.088 --> 21:34.422
I just can't be with someone
whose life is in complete disarray.

21:36.628 --> 21:40.428
-What happened to all the shirts?
-They gave them to Goodwill.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.700
Puffy shirt. Puffy shirt.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.269
Can you spare a little change
for an old buccaneer?

21:54.346 --> 21:57.213
You know, it's really not
a bad-looking shirt.

22:06.892 --> 22:11.693
Why do we always have to say,
"Excuse me"...

22:11.863 --> 22:13.797
...when we can't hear
what someone's saying?

22:13.965 --> 22:16.661
Why are we so guilty and so..?
"Excuse me.

22:16.835 --> 22:20.327
Pardon me. I'm sorry."
Why can't, just once, I go:

22:20.505 --> 22:23.030
"Nope. Not loud enough"?

22:23.208 --> 22:25.199
Why can't I do that?

22:26.845 --> 22:29.939
Just once I would
like to have the guts...

22:30.349 --> 22:31.907
...you know, to make that judgment.

22:32.084 --> 22:35.349
Someone mumbles something,
and you go, "Your fault.

22:35.520 --> 22:39.012
I'm not sorry,
because it's your fault."
