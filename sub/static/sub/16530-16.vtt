00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.341
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.409 --> 00:09.777
sexually based offenses

00:09.810 --> 00:11.779
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.248
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.282 --> 00:16.184
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.217 --> 00:17.485
are members of an elite squad

00:17.518 --> 00:19.520
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.355
These are their stories.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.257
[dramatic tones]

00:23.291 --> 00:25.426
- We're 45 seconds out to air.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.828
Hair and makeup,
you have 15 seconds.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.830
- Camera two, ready.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.832
- 30 seconds to air.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.801
- Thanks for being here, Olivia.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.269
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.171
How are you?
- I know. I'm good.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.273
Just, you know,
a little nervous right now.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.808
- Oh, don't be.
You're a pro.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.643
- What are we waiting for,
the damn actress?

00:42.676 --> 00:44.645
- There she is.
- My fault.

00:44.678 --> 00:47.348
I'm such a fan of Ms. Delucci,

00:47.381 --> 00:50.084
I practically kidnapped her.
- Not a problem.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.652
We're ready when you are,
Mr. Coyle.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.388
- Places.
Ten seconds.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.524
- [chuckles]
- Hi. Good morning.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.825
- Hi.
- Please have a seat.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.160
- We ready, people?
- Good morning.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.229
- In five, four...

01:03.897 --> 01:05.433
- Good morning
from New York City.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.435
I'm Heidi Sorenson.
- And I'm George Thanos.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.837
Thank you for joining us
on "HNT Morning Live."

01:09.870 --> 01:12.106
- Also joining us today,
Golden Globe winner

01:12.140 --> 01:14.375
Davina Delucci
and Manhattan SVU's Lieutenant

01:14.408 --> 01:16.477
Olivia Benson.
- If you were paying attention

01:16.510 --> 01:18.312
to the recent news cycle,
you couldn't miss

01:18.346 --> 01:21.415
the controversy surrounding
the 2007 film, "Turnstyle."

01:21.449 --> 01:24.185
- Davina Delucci has alleged
she was raped, on camera,

01:24.218 --> 01:26.687
by her co-star, while filming
the movie's infamous sex scene.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.889
Davina is pursuing legal action.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.624
We'll hear her story,
but first,

01:30.658 --> 01:33.161
Lieutenant Benson,
what can you tell us

01:33.194 --> 01:35.896
about workplace sexual assault?
- Well, it happens

01:35.929 --> 01:38.332
all too often,
and unfortunately,

01:38.366 --> 01:40.434
it's one of
the least reported crimes.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.703
- Why is that?
- Women are afraid of

01:42.736 --> 01:45.606
not being believed,
of losing their job.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.209
- Does this ring true
for you, Davina?

01:48.242 --> 01:50.211
You waited almost ten years
to go public.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.346
- Yes, I was scared
if I said anything

01:52.380 --> 01:54.615
I'd never work again.
- And your rapist--

01:54.648 --> 01:56.650
alleged rapist,
Dante Marino,

01:56.684 --> 01:59.253
was not only your co-star,
he was your director.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.721
- That's right.
- Can you tell us

02:00.754 --> 02:03.391
what happened on the set?
- We were scheduled to film

02:03.424 --> 02:05.326
the love scene later that day.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.295
Dante told me the scene
was being re-written.

02:07.328 --> 02:10.564
- Re-written how?
- He didn't go into detail.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.500
He just told me to...

02:12.533 --> 02:15.369
respond in the moment
organically.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.205
- And what happened
while filming?

02:17.238 --> 02:19.707
- We were on a couch.
Kissing.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.377
Then Dante got aggressive.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.246
Before I knew
what was happening,

02:25.279 --> 02:27.348
he was raping me.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.317
I couldn't fight him off.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.519
I was frozen.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.454
- You couldn't move.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.523
- That's right.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.526
For ten years audiences thought
they were watching a love scene,

02:38.559 --> 02:40.461
but they were watching a rape.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.663
My rape.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.598
And I was too afraid
to say anything.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.600
- So, you pretended
like nothing happened.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.469
- Yes.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.438
He was my director.
My boss.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.440
- And you were afraid
for your job.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.342
- Yes.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.277
- I can't imagine
what you were going through.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.612
- Of course you can't, George.
It never happened to you.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.651
- A very, um...

03:03.684 --> 03:07.288
um...disturbing story.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.557
Thank you, Davina.
Uh, Lieutenant Benson.

03:09.590 --> 03:12.260
We'll be back after the break
with our special guest

03:12.293 --> 03:13.494
Karl Rove.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.230
- And we're out.
- Excuse me.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.733
- Hey, you okay?
What just happened?

03:19.767 --> 03:21.602
- Harold Coyle raped me
in January,

03:21.635 --> 03:23.504
on the couch in his office.
- Let's get you some air.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.439
- No, no, I'm fine.
I'm just--I'm tired.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.275
- Okay, I think we need
to speak.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.342
- What I said,
I didn't mean any of it.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.279
I'm fine. Sorry.
- Heidi...

03:36.717 --> 03:39.687
[dramatic music]

03:39.720 --> 03:46.760
*

03:56.737 --> 04:03.777
*

04:23.731 --> 04:24.264
.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.666
- I can't imagine
what you were going through.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.000
- Of course you can't, George,
it never happened to you.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.970
- You all saw that, right?

04:30.003 --> 04:32.072
- On-air disclosure?
- We were watching you live.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.607
They couldn't cut away
fast enough.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.409
- Yeah, and then she told me

04:35.443 --> 04:37.978
that Harold Coyle raped her.
- Coyle, huh?

04:38.011 --> 04:39.980
Heard a lot of rumors
about that guy.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.316
He's paranoid, he's a predator.
- How well do you know Heidi?

04:42.350 --> 04:44.518
- We met at a "Women in New
York" panel years ago.

04:44.552 --> 04:47.321
We stayed in touch.
I don't see her making this up.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.357
- Okay, did she give you
any more details?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.392
- Oh, no, she back-tracked.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.060
She's now not returning
my calls.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.363
- So, what's our move now?
- Excuse me, Lieutenant?

04:55.396 --> 04:58.065
This guy says urgent.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.968
- Hi.
How can I help you?

05:01.001 --> 05:02.770
- I saw you on "HNT"
this morning.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.605
Heidi Sorenson,
she was talking about

05:04.638 --> 05:07.408
Harold Coyle, wasn't she?
- Why do you ask?

05:07.441 --> 05:09.443
- He assaulted my wife.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.613
This is her, Amy.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.682
She worked in public relations
at "HNT."

05:17.084 --> 05:18.686
- Okay.
- Okay, can you tell us

05:18.719 --> 05:20.020
what happened?

05:20.053 --> 05:21.555
- Harold was always
making moves,

05:21.589 --> 05:23.557
being flirty.
She told him she was married.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.559
- But he didn't stop.
- No.

05:25.593 --> 05:29.029
He kept pressuring her,
making sexual comments.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.764
She went along with it.

05:30.798 --> 05:33.734
Then one day,
she said "no" to him.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.437
And he...raped her.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.473
- She told you this?
- Yes.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.808
I said we should
go to the police.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.743
File a report.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.645
- Can I ask why you didn't?

05:44.678 --> 05:47.748
- She told me Harold had
taped her.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.518
He had made it look like
they were having an affair.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.085
Then after he raped her,
he said,

05:52.119 --> 05:54.021
if she went to the police,
he'd release the tapes.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.089
She didn't want to hurt me.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.993
After that...

06:00.027 --> 06:03.397
she went into a depression.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.733
She committed suicide
six months later.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.636
- I'm so sorry.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.405
- I want you to go after
that bastard and the network.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.841
They all knew about him
and nobody did a thing.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.810
- Coyle threatened her directly?

06:16.844 --> 06:18.612
- His producer, Turner.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.714
He said, if Amy wanted
to go after Coyle,

06:20.748 --> 06:23.784
it would be scorched earth.
"HNT" would destroy us.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.861
- Steven Turner? SVU.
- If you're here about Heidi,

06:33.894 --> 06:35.729
your Lieutenant already knows,
there's nothing to talk about,

06:35.763 --> 06:37.097
and I'm sorry,
but I'm late for a meeting.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.599
- Actually, we're here
about Amy James.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.033
- Amy James.
- Yeah, she worked here

06:40.067 --> 06:43.537
a few years ago.
She killed herself.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.641
- I did hear about that.
A tragedy.

06:47.675 --> 06:51.044
- Yeah, did you also hear she
accused Harold Coyle of assault,

06:51.078 --> 06:52.513
just like Heidi?

06:52.546 --> 06:53.781
- Maybe you should talk
to our lawyers.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.783
- Good.
We can ask them to turn over

06:55.816 --> 06:58.185
the video tapes of Amy.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.754
The tapes Coyle
was blackmailing her with.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.189
- I think you're off base here.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.157
- We have two allegations
of assault.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.093
Now, a publicist
who's mentally unstable,

07:06.126 --> 07:07.561
she's easy to discredit,

07:07.595 --> 07:10.197
but the star of the network,
not so much.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.766
- Harold, Harold, Harold, what
can you tell us about Heidi?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.668
Will she be back tomorrow?
- We hope so.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.070
This morning Heidi was
obviously very emotional

07:17.104 --> 07:20.207
after hearing Davina's story.
Why we love her here.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.610
- Margery,
what's next for you at "HNT"?

07:22.643 --> 07:25.112
- I hope to follow
in Heidi's footsteps.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.848
She's a real talent,
a dedicated journalist.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.518
I consider her a mentor.
- Mr. Coyle, what can you--

07:30.551 --> 07:32.853
- The real reason Heidi
had her "breakdown"?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.855
She was trying to
renegotiate her contract.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.724
Then she found out
Margery Evans is being groomed

07:36.757 --> 07:38.225
to replace her.
- "Groomed"?

07:38.258 --> 07:40.093
By who? Harold Coyle?

07:40.127 --> 07:41.729
- This is a brutal business
for women.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.230
There's a shelf life.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.533
No matter how much
plastic surgery they get.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.102
[camera shutters clicking]

07:49.136 --> 07:51.705
[dramatic tones]

07:51.739 --> 07:54.608
[doorbell rings]

07:54.642 --> 07:56.176
- I told you
I didn't want to talk.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.546
- Heidi, please.
It's important.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.480
- [sighs]

08:02.215 --> 08:03.884
- Is it true that
you're re-negotiating

08:03.917 --> 08:06.787
your contract with "HNT"?
- I'm exploring my options.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.188
- Is that why you
don't wanna tell me the truth

08:08.221 --> 08:09.790
about what happened
this morning?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.625
- I should never have said
his name out loud like that.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.193
- Why?
Because it isn't true?

08:13.226 --> 08:15.495
Or because you're scared
of getting fired?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.136
Okay,
let's say it is true.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.607
- I'm not ruining my career
because I had a weak moment.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.741
I fixed it.

08:27.775 --> 08:28.976
I apologized
to Harold personally.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.278
He knows it won't happen again.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.981
- Did you know Amy James?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.617
- She had...problems.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.686
- He had tape on her.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.826
Does he have tape on you?
- No!

08:47.861 --> 08:49.763
- We can fight this.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.299
- Don't judge me.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.267
And don't worry.
I'm not going to kill myself.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.305
- All right.
Well, when you're ready

08:58.338 --> 09:00.307
to have a serious conversation,

09:00.340 --> 09:02.542
you know where I am.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.651
- Uh, Lieutenant,
Chief Dodds is here.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.253
- Lieutenant. Counselor.
- Chief.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.889
It's been a while.
- 1PP got a call

09:15.923 --> 09:17.758
from Steven Turner at "HNT."

09:17.791 --> 09:19.827
You're investigating Harold
Coyle on assault charges?

09:19.860 --> 09:22.229
- It's very preliminary.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.231
- Who's the complainant?

09:24.264 --> 09:26.333
- It's really
very preliminary.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.836
- Okay.
That's what Turner said.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.270
Your detectives
are basically throwing

09:30.303 --> 09:31.905
spaghetti at the wall.
- All due respect,

09:31.939 --> 09:34.608
I hope you're not advising
we stay away from "HNT"?

09:34.642 --> 09:36.710
- Of course not.
A powerful, bombastic

09:36.744 --> 09:38.679
news organization
with a penchant for suing

09:38.712 --> 09:42.015
law enforcement,
who go after enemies on Twitter,

09:42.049 --> 09:43.984
and who have friends in
the current administration--

09:44.017 --> 09:46.687
- I hear ya.
- If you have reason to believe

09:46.720 --> 09:48.622
there are individuals
in such organizations

09:48.656 --> 09:50.223
that may be guilty
of sexual assault,

09:50.257 --> 09:53.393
of course you have
to investigate it.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.362
Just have a damn good reason.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.264
- I hear you, Chief.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.667
- I'll leave
you two to it.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.372
- So, happy
to be back at work yet?

10:05.405 --> 10:08.676
- After that?
Almost makes me miss suspension.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.748
- Good night, Noah.

10:14.782 --> 10:18.351
- Another story.
- Aw, sweetie, no more stories.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.721
We gotta go to bed.
It's so late.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.356
Okay?
Close your eyes, sweet one.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.392
All right,
see you in the morning.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.895
See you in the morning.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.731
Night night.
Love you.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.801
[knocking at door]

10:34.968 --> 10:36.837
- I'm sorry to bother you
at home.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.773
- It's okay.
Please, come on in.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.842
- [sighs]
- What's going on?

10:41.875 --> 10:44.678
- They are replacing me
with Margery Evans.

10:44.712 --> 10:47.380
Officially,
I'm "on vacation."

10:47.414 --> 10:49.883
- I see.
- You were right.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.785
When I went to apologize
to Harold,

10:51.819 --> 10:53.887
he forced me onto my knees,
and he said I had to

10:53.921 --> 10:56.757
show him
how serious I was.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.425
I actually thought
that would work,

10:58.458 --> 11:00.894
that I'd get my job back.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.096
He screwed me in private,
that's one thing,

11:03.130 --> 11:05.032
but he just screwed me
in public.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.367
- And you're ready
to go after Coyle now?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.069
- I know what it looks like.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.871
That I'm doing this
because I got fired,

11:10.904 --> 11:13.673
but that's not the reason.
- Oh, I believe you.

11:24.117 --> 11:24.251
.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.118
- It started day one,
my job interview.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.924
Coyle said to me,
"Oh, you're beautiful,

11:30.958 --> 11:33.961
"you're bright,
you could be a star.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.229
"But I interviewed
five other women today,

11:36.263 --> 11:38.999
"that are just as qualified
and I'm going to hire

11:39.032 --> 11:41.935
whoever shows me
she wants it the most."

11:41.969 --> 11:43.336
- And then what happened?

11:43.370 --> 11:46.206
- He put his hand
inside my blouse.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.176
Uh, and his tongue in my mouth.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.880
I was shocked, frozen.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.282
But I didn't
run out of the room

11:55.315 --> 11:58.285
and I got the job.
- And the behavior continued?

11:58.318 --> 12:01.021
- Yeah.
Touching...

12:01.054 --> 12:03.857
Kissing, groping.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.228
He would demand that I wear...

12:08.261 --> 12:10.230
lacy panties,

12:10.263 --> 12:13.300
thigh-high stockings.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.235
Before I went on the air,
I'd have to give him

12:15.268 --> 12:19.406
a private fashion show
and pretend to seduce him,

12:19.439 --> 12:21.474
and he would tape me.

12:22.943 --> 12:26.213
- How long did this go on?
- Years.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.849
And I didn't think
things could get any worse,

12:28.882 --> 12:31.151
until January they did.
- Okay.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.220
Tell us about that.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.124
- The ratings were high
and my contract was up

12:37.157 --> 12:39.960
and I told Coyle, if he
wanted me to stay at "HNT,"

12:39.993 --> 12:41.294
I wanted a promotion.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.496
He--

12:43.530 --> 12:45.398
He locked the door,

12:45.432 --> 12:47.367
threw me onto a couch,

12:47.400 --> 12:49.469
pulled up my skirt...

12:49.502 --> 12:51.972
and he raped me.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.007
I fought him...

12:54.041 --> 12:56.076
but I couldn't get away.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.012
He said if I complained,
he'd release the tapes

12:59.046 --> 13:01.081
that he had or worse.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.150
And that if I wasn't happy
at the morning show,

13:03.183 --> 13:04.885
he'd hire Margery Evans.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.987
- So you didn't report it.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.056
- [crying]
No.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.125
I straightened myself up,

13:12.159 --> 13:15.528
walked out,
and I went back to work.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.365
Like a good girl.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.334
Like a good, stupid girl.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.037
- Did you confide in anyone?

13:24.071 --> 13:27.007
- The irony is, Margery was
the one person I told.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.076
I was trying to warn her.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.188
- Thank you for
talking to us, Ms. Evans.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.324
- Of course. I hope you don't
mind, I asked my lawyer to join.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.193
I'm a little nervous.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.195
- Margery wants to cooperate,
but, um,

13:48.228 --> 13:50.197
we need
to protect ourselves here.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.399
- Okay,
but she's not a suspect.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.434
- No, of course not.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.169
- You said you had questions
about Heidi?

13:56.203 --> 13:59.306
- Yeah.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.409
How would you describe
your relationship?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.311
- I consider her a friend.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.313
- What about her relationship
with Harold Coyle?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.048
- It's very good.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.449
They've had their
dust ups, on occasion.

14:09.482 --> 14:13.086
- Has Heidi ever talked
to you about how

14:13.120 --> 14:15.355
Coyle treated her?
- I don't know what you mean.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.025
- Well, she told us that

14:18.058 --> 14:20.593
she confided in you

14:20.627 --> 14:23.163
that she'd been assaulted
by him.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.098
- I don't remember that.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.967
- She never told you about being

14:27.000 --> 14:28.368
sexually harassed by Coyle?

14:28.401 --> 14:31.204
She never warned you
about Coyle?

14:31.238 --> 14:33.106
- Never.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.208
Is that what
she's telling the police?

14:35.242 --> 14:38.411
- Uh, yes.
- Harold is like a father

14:38.445 --> 14:40.480
to all of us.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.352
- If that's all, Detectives,
I think that constitutes

14:45.385 --> 14:48.121
full cooperation.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.357
- I don't know why Heidi
would say something like that.

14:50.390 --> 14:54.327
- You think any woman
would go public

14:54.361 --> 14:56.496
and subject herself
to that kind of

14:56.529 --> 14:58.431
public scrutiny
if it weren't true?

14:58.465 --> 15:00.233
- Well, I don't believe
it's true.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.135
That's not the Harold Coyle
I know.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.006
- Harold Coyle values three
things in a female anchor:

15:06.039 --> 15:08.141
high cheekbones,
long legs,

15:08.175 --> 15:10.043
and how willing she is
to get down on her knees.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.578
- Yeah,
we've been getting that.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.281
- He's a paranoid egomaniac,
who has intel on everyone.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.149
Internal investigations
dead-ended.

15:16.183 --> 15:19.119
- Including Amy James?
- It's a real shame about Amy.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.221
- Did you know Coyle
was harassing her?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.156
- Off the record?
I suspected.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.557
- What about Heidi?
- I'm sure she's had

15:24.591 --> 15:27.160
her fair share
of unwanted attention.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.328
She's making
a criminal complaint

15:28.361 --> 15:30.497
on the sexual harassment?
- No.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.465
Actually, she's saying
that Coyle raped her.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.435
- [groans]
Jeez.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.470
So that's what
that was about yesterday.

15:37.504 --> 15:41.141
- She says it happened
the morning of January 3rd.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.176
You two did a show
that day?

15:43.210 --> 15:46.246
- Yes. Yes, we did.
She didn't say anything to me.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.514
- Did anything
about her demeanor

15:47.547 --> 15:50.050
strike you as different?
Was she--was she upset?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.518
- Well, yeah,
now that I think about it.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.253
She's been off
the past few months.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.455
Crying jags,
snapping at the crew.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.257
I wasn't surprised
she melted down on camera.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.627
- Would you be willing
to tell that to our ADA?

16:00.660 --> 16:02.562
- I hate Coyle,

16:02.595 --> 16:05.132
but my contract expires
in six months.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.666
I get on his bad side,
it's not like I can

16:06.699 --> 16:08.368
walk around his office
in my underwear

16:08.401 --> 16:10.437
and make it all go away.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.343
- Everybody at "HNT"
knows about Coyle,

16:16.376 --> 16:17.610
but nobody's willing
to talk about it.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.446
- Okay,
par for the course.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.647
- I was hoping for at least
one corroborating witness.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.449
- Well, we have Heidi's story

16:22.482 --> 16:24.484
and once she came forward,
she's been consistent.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.453
- What about texts?
E-mails to Coyle?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.321
Any change after
the alleged assault?

16:28.355 --> 16:31.091
- Well, there's no communication
saying, "Why did you rape me?"

16:31.124 --> 16:33.193
And there's certainly nothing
from him to her.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.494
- What about the timeline?

16:34.527 --> 16:36.263
- She got to work at 6:00.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.498
She was in with him
from 6:20 to 7:10.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.467
- Behind closed doors
with no witnesses.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.104
- Somebody else was there.
Coyle.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.506
Look, I think it's time for us
to get his side of the story.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.208
- With no evidence
for leverage?

16:48.241 --> 16:49.542
- He doesn't know that.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.445
And he's notoriously paranoid.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.315
- Okay, we'll talk to him.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.717
Together.

16:57.750 --> 17:01.354
- You don't think that I can
handle it alone?

17:01.388 --> 17:04.391
- I do,
but I want him to know

17:04.424 --> 17:06.459
how seriously NYPD
is taking this.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.533
[dramatic tones]

17:13.566 --> 17:15.268
Well,
thanks for seeing us today.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.669
- Of course.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.406
My attorney,
Richard Pace.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.541
- Chief Dodds,
Lieutenant Benson.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.143
- So why are we all here?

17:23.176 --> 17:24.744
- Well, we'd like to talk
to your client

17:24.777 --> 17:26.546
about Heidi Sorenson.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.648
- A wonderful talent.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.717
She's been under
a lot of stress lately.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.752
- Can you tell us about
your relationship with her?

17:32.785 --> 17:35.788
- It's very good.
Mutual respect, appreciation.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.691
- Appreciation, I get that.
She's very attractive.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.627
- Yes, she is.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.330
- Have you two ever been
in your office alone together?

17:43.363 --> 17:45.798
- Of course.
Yes.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.700
- Okay, how about on
January 3rd?

17:47.734 --> 17:50.570
Were you alone together then?
- It's possible.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.240
I'd have to ask my secretary.

17:53.273 --> 17:56.409
Why?
- Heidi Sorenson is alleging

17:56.443 --> 17:58.678
that you raped her
on that morning.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.248
- Well,
I'm shocked to hear that.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.550
I'm--I'm stunned.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.752
- Is that a denial?
- Absolutely.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.588
- I can assure you,
these allegations are credible.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.591
- And I can assure you,
there's no merit to the story.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.493
- Oh, I don't see
the upside of her

18:13.526 --> 18:15.495
making something like that up.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.330
- She's aging out of the demo.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.599
She's obviously looking
to leverage us.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.834
- She hasn't hired
a civil attorney.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.271
She came directly to me.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.738
- When did she come to you?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.740
After she found out
she was being replaced

18:27.774 --> 18:29.809
by Margery Evans?

18:31.644 --> 18:33.780
- We just wanna hear
your side.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.448
To know what
we're looking at here.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.551
- Any sexual assault claims
are baseless,

18:38.585 --> 18:41.488
more than false,
and from where I sit,

18:41.521 --> 18:43.756
defamatory.
- Are you threatening to sue us?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.625
- I just want to remind you

18:45.658 --> 18:47.727
that this organization
is in the business

18:47.760 --> 18:49.762
of uncovering and exposing...

18:49.796 --> 18:51.631
the truth.
- The truth?

18:51.664 --> 18:54.634
[chuckles]
That's a matter of opinion.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.503
- The point is...

18:56.536 --> 18:59.472
if there's anything to find,
we'll find it.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.275
Like who was responsible

19:02.309 --> 19:04.344
for Sergeant Mike Dodds'
death.

19:06.679 --> 19:10.383
And why
the internal investigation

19:10.417 --> 19:12.519
was closed in less
than 24 hours.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.490
- Okay.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.427
We're done here.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.828
- I think we can all agree
this meeting

19:21.861 --> 19:23.796
has ceased to be productive.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.566
- And I think we
know what we're looking at here.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.402
Rest assured,
we will continue to investigate.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.871
- Good.
So will we.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.874
I know NYPD's year
hasn't been as disastrous

19:34.907 --> 19:37.710
as say, Chicago's,
but I'm sure no one at 1PP

19:37.744 --> 19:40.480
wants stories about
incompetence,

19:40.513 --> 19:43.616
maybe corruption,
dominating the news cycle.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.618
The thing about digging,

19:45.652 --> 19:47.687
you never know what
you're going to find.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.823
[chuckles]

19:54.427 --> 19:56.729
- What he implied about
Mike's death...

19:56.763 --> 19:59.499
- That's what they do
at this network,

19:59.532 --> 20:02.335
stoke fear and paranoia.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.837
I don't think
you're responsible.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.340
I know a few months ago
I said some things--

20:07.374 --> 20:09.642
things I didn't mean.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.711
I should've apologized sooner.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.682
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.485
I'm your boss.
I was out of line.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.788
The only thing I can say is...

20:21.821 --> 20:23.890
the wound was still fresh.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.593
- I know.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.628
- And we don't give up
this fight.

20:40.507 --> 20:40.840
.

20:40.873 --> 20:41.741
- I've always considered
Harold Coyle a mentor.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.812
Almost a father figure.
I trust him implicitly.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.914
- So you haven't experienced
the kind of harassment at "HNT"

20:47.947 --> 20:49.782
that Heidi Sorenson
is alleging?

20:49.816 --> 20:51.784
- Absolutely not.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.720
And you know, Harold and I
have discussed this,

20:53.753 --> 20:56.323
and I can tell you
he's incredibly hurt.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.058
He's treated Heidi
with nothing but respect.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.461
- Margery's a real pro.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.996
Coyle knows what he's doing.
- We knew this could happen.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.732
He's just playing hardball.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.867
- So what happens now?
- If we want to take it

21:07.900 --> 21:10.537
to court,
you need more for the jury.

21:10.570 --> 21:14.574
So, Heidi, did you tell
anyone about the assault?

21:14.607 --> 21:16.376
Send a text?
Send an e-mail?

21:16.409 --> 21:19.512
- No. Margery was
the one person I confided in.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.348
- Look, I know that you want
to go after Coyle,

21:21.381 --> 21:23.416
criminally, but the fact is...
[cell phone chimes]

21:23.450 --> 21:26.353
You might have more leverage
pursuing a civil case.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.021
- This isn't about money.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.491
- Do you know a Gwendolyn Gates?

21:31.524 --> 21:34.594
- Yeah, she was an anchor
at "HNT" ten years ago.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.330
- She's on her way
to our squad room.

21:37.364 --> 21:40.299
She says that Harold Coyle
assaulted her, too.

21:41.534 --> 21:44.504
- I turned on the TV,
saw Margery Evans

21:44.537 --> 21:48.441
spouting
that inane defense of Harold.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.510
I couldn't stay silent
any longer.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.545
- Thanks for coming in.
- I should've known

21:52.579 --> 21:54.046
it wasn't just me.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.949
- Tell us what happened
with Coyle.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.552
- You're gonna need
more paper.

21:59.586 --> 22:02.422
- So "HNT" is doing our job
for us?

22:02.455 --> 22:04.791
- The more audacity they have
with their denials,

22:04.824 --> 22:06.526
the more it's back-firing.

22:06.559 --> 22:10.029
- Liv, two more women
that worked for "HNT"

22:10.062 --> 22:12.399
say they were harassed
by Harold Coyle.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.500
- Well, now we're getting
somewhere.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.435
- Get their statements.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.104
- All right,
so we got four women,

22:18.137 --> 22:20.540
all former "HNT" employees,
with credible stories

22:20.573 --> 22:22.141
of harassment
going back 15 years.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.511
- Okay, good.
What's the bad news?

22:24.544 --> 22:26.846
- They're all allegations
of misdemeanor assault,

22:26.879 --> 22:28.515
from over two years ago.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.082
Outside of the statue
of limitations.

22:30.116 --> 22:33.085
- Except for Heidi's rape
which is a he said, she said.

22:33.119 --> 22:36.055
- And one allegation
of attempted rape.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.557
Alana Reed, 20 years old.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.058
She quit
right after the incident.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.528
- Tell me she went to HR.
- No, but she was

22:41.561 --> 22:43.830
George Thanos' assistant
and he already hates Coyle.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.599
- [chuckles] And this gives him
one more reason.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.471
- She was 20 years old
just like my daughter.

22:51.504 --> 22:54.574
- Coyle is a bad guy, George.
- Why didn't Alana tell me?

22:54.607 --> 22:56.609
- Maybe she thought
you wouldn't believe her.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.077
Maybe she thought
you wouldn't back her up.

22:58.110 --> 22:59.546
- Like Heidi.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.047
- Heidi and I have been
behind a news desk,

23:01.080 --> 23:02.615
in the foxhole,
for seven years.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.083
Nobody has her back
more than I do.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.885
- Then act like it.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.955
Testify that you saw how upset
she was after the rape.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.190
We need someone
to back up her story up.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.460
- I want to, I do,
but I can't.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.995
- George, you said
you had a daughter, right?

23:16.028 --> 23:18.064
Well, she must've heard
about this on the news.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.932
She hasn't ask you
what you know?

23:19.966 --> 23:22.001
What you're doing about it?

23:24.003 --> 23:25.905
- This is a Kamikaze
career move.

23:25.938 --> 23:29.476
- This of it like this,
you'll go down as a hero.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.882
[dramatic tones]

23:35.915 --> 23:39.151
- On one count of first degree
rape of Heidi Sorenson,

23:39.185 --> 23:42.054
how do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.890
- People on bail?
- Given Mr. Coyle's

23:43.923 --> 23:46.726
financial resources, including
an on-call private jet,

23:46.759 --> 23:49.696
we believe he's a flight risk.
People ask for $10 million.

23:49.729 --> 23:52.632
- My client has no priors,
and fully intends to show up

23:52.665 --> 23:55.668
in court and defend himself
against these baseless charges.

23:55.702 --> 23:58.671
- Bail is set at $2 million
and Mr. Coyle surrenders

23:58.705 --> 24:00.740
his passport.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.243
- I hope you know
what you're doing.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.513
- It's good to see you,
Harold.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.682
Good luck.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.751
Careful what you wish for.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.622
[both sigh]
- Now what?

24:15.655 --> 24:17.557
- I file a motion to include
the testimony

24:17.590 --> 24:18.691
of the four other victims.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.159
The defense files a motion
to exclude.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.061
- Okay, you know
the other women are pursuing

24:22.094 --> 24:23.195
a civil case.
- I do.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.131
I already asked
for the depositions.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.233
Hope to hell the judge
agrees that they show pattern

24:27.266 --> 24:28.935
or we're looking at
a he said, she said

24:28.968 --> 24:32.004
with a man who has
no compunction about lying.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.241
- My name is Alana Reed.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.944
I was an employee of "HNT"

24:37.977 --> 24:40.747
from January
to December of 2016.

24:40.780 --> 24:44.050
- My name is Diane Douglas.
- Gwendolyn Gates.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.552
- I'm Christine Davis.

24:45.585 --> 24:48.187
- I had just started
at the network.

24:48.220 --> 24:52.191
I was a cub reporter.
- I had just turned 25.

24:52.224 --> 24:53.660
- It was four and a half
years ago.

24:53.693 --> 24:56.529
I was a newlywed.
- I was only 19.

24:56.563 --> 24:59.566
I was a production assistant
on "HNT Update."

24:59.599 --> 25:02.969
- I was introduced to Coyle
at an awards dinner.

25:03.002 --> 25:06.005
- He invited me to audition
for an opening in broadcasting.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.575
- He pulled out some stockings
from his drawer,

25:08.608 --> 25:11.678
asked me to put them on.
- Lifted my skirt,

25:11.711 --> 25:13.580
slid his hand on my leg...

25:13.613 --> 25:15.682
- Put a hand on my shoulder.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.817
Eventually...

25:17.850 --> 25:19.819
he tried to kiss me.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.154
I didn't know what to do.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.724
- At first it wasn't so bad.

25:24.757 --> 25:28.060
He'd say, "Lift your skirt,
show me those legs."

25:28.094 --> 25:30.730
- Later it escalated.
"Take off your blouse."

25:30.763 --> 25:33.132
- Putting his...
tongue in my mouth.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.301
- If I complained,
he'd remind me,

25:35.334 --> 25:37.737
he had me on tape.
- He had a tape.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.038
- I didn't feel like
I could tell anyone.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.640
I mean,
he was the head of the network.

25:40.673 --> 25:43.109
- I never even told my husband.
- I never told anyone.

25:43.142 --> 25:46.112
- I--
[labored breathing]

25:46.145 --> 25:49.115
I had to quit.
- I couldn't sleep or eat.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.751
- [crying] I thought that
since I didn't leave the room...

25:51.784 --> 25:55.287
I was complicit.
- That it was my fault.

25:55.321 --> 25:58.157
That's why
I never came forward.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.226
Until now.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.768
- Gentlemen,
I've reviewed the depositions

26:08.801 --> 26:10.737
at issue and am prepared
to hear arguments.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.605
Mr. Barba?
- The statements,

26:12.639 --> 26:14.741
which detail bad acts
by the defendant,

26:14.774 --> 26:16.843
show one more example
of the crime he's charged with

26:16.876 --> 26:19.646
is part of an on-going and
pervasive pattern of behavior.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.814
- Defense objects.
These are unproven allegations

26:21.848 --> 26:25.151
from years ago which were
never reported at the time.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.819
The State had the opportunity
to bring them

26:26.853 --> 26:28.888
as criminal charges,
but declined to do so.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.190
- These women's statements
clearly show motive,

26:31.223 --> 26:33.726
and the same MO,
in each case.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.863
The jury needs to hear them
to understand

26:36.896 --> 26:39.265
that the rape
that Coyle is charged with

26:39.298 --> 26:42.301
is part of a broader pattern
of conduct.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.103
- The only question before
the jury should be

26:44.136 --> 26:46.205
the facts
of the specific charge.

26:46.238 --> 26:49.108
Anything else would be extremely
prejudicial in this case.

26:52.879 --> 26:54.714
- Mr. Barba,
while I find these statements

26:54.747 --> 26:57.216
to be important evidence,
I agree with defense,

26:57.249 --> 26:58.885
that in this case,
it would be more prejudicial

26:58.918 --> 27:00.386
than probative.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.221
People's motion is denied.
[gavel pounds]

27:02.254 --> 27:04.390
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.196
Not the ruling
I was hoping for.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.398
- So where does that leave us?
- With two witnesses.

27:12.431 --> 27:13.766
Heidi Sorenson
and George Thanos.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.401
- Is that enough
to go to trial?

27:15.434 --> 27:16.803
- [scoffs] If I'm willing
to go out on a very high,

27:16.836 --> 27:18.671
very shaky limb.

27:18.705 --> 27:20.372
- I assume that's a yes?

27:28.748 --> 27:28.881
.

27:28.915 --> 27:29.749
- He was my director.
My boss.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.019
- And you were afraid
for your job.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.153
- I can't imagine
what you were going through.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.788
- Of course you can't, George,

27:35.822 --> 27:37.223
'cause it never
happened to you.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.791
- You were seated next to
Ms. Sorenson.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.727
In your experience as an SVU,

27:40.760 --> 27:42.228
Lieutenant,
what can you tell us?

27:42.261 --> 27:44.897
- She was triggered.
She was traumatized.

27:44.931 --> 27:47.433
In my opinion,
she exhibited symptoms

27:47.466 --> 27:48.868
of a victim of sexual assault.

27:48.901 --> 27:49.869
- But when you tried
to follow up,

27:49.902 --> 27:51.137
she refused to speak to you?

27:51.170 --> 27:53.773
- No, she had
an emotional reaction

27:53.806 --> 27:55.942
and then she backed down
which is not uncommon.

27:55.975 --> 27:58.010
- Two days later,
she did disclose that

27:58.044 --> 28:00.146
Harold Coyle had assaulted her?
- Yes.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.181
- Thank you.
Nothing further.

28:05.284 --> 28:06.986
- That was well-timed.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.821
A "spontaneous" disclosure
of assault

28:08.855 --> 28:11.123
when the SVU Lieutenant
was in the studio.

28:11.157 --> 28:13.159
- And I believed her.
- Oh, I'm sure.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.994
It's your experience
to believe most victims

28:15.027 --> 28:16.896
at first disclosure, isn't it?
- Yes.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.865
- Heidi initially
reversed herself,

28:18.898 --> 28:21.033
saying she didn't mean
what she said?

28:21.067 --> 28:22.735
- Yes, but that's--
- She didn't want to take

28:22.769 --> 28:24.837
your calls so you decide
to pay her a personal visit.

28:24.871 --> 28:27.206
At that point, did she
repeat her allegations

28:27.239 --> 28:29.175
or deny them?
- At that time she did not

28:29.208 --> 28:31.844
want to cooperate.
- In fact, she only decided

28:31.878 --> 28:33.479
she wanted to cooperate
when she found out

28:33.512 --> 28:36.048
she was being let go
from "HNT" correct?

28:36.082 --> 28:40.019
- I do not think that her
motivation was financial then

28:40.052 --> 28:42.021
and I do not think
it's financial now.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.858
- Really? She was losing
a $12 million-a-year job.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.094
But, as you said,
you're a believer, Lieutenant.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.295
- Is there a question here,
Your Honor?

28:49.328 --> 28:52.064
- Mr. Pace?
- No, nothing further.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.869
- Harold Coyle fondled
my breasts,

28:56.903 --> 29:00.539
and put his tongue in my mouth,
during my job interview.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.810
It escalated from there.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.312
At dinner the night
before I started at "HNT,"

29:06.345 --> 29:08.781
he tried to convince me

29:08.815 --> 29:11.317
to have sex and I declined.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.519
- How did he respond?

29:13.552 --> 29:15.021
- He said
he controlled my career

29:15.054 --> 29:16.923
and that no one said no
to the boss

29:16.956 --> 29:18.825
and he was gonna have to
fix that.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.827
- How did he "fix" it?

29:20.860 --> 29:24.096
- He forced me to dance
provocatively in lingerie.

29:24.130 --> 29:27.299
I would have to touch myself
while being taped.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.069
- Why did you go along with it?

29:30.102 --> 29:31.838
- There was always
the underlying threat

29:31.871 --> 29:33.973
of being fired
and he'd--

29:34.006 --> 29:36.108
he--he--he tortured me
psychologically.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.910
I-I felt trapped.

29:37.944 --> 29:40.246
- What happened on the morning
of January 3rd this year?

29:40.279 --> 29:42.248
- I went into his office,
to discuss my future

29:42.281 --> 29:44.516
at the network.
I-I wanted more.

29:44.550 --> 29:48.554
I was argumentative.
He got angry.

29:48.587 --> 29:51.523
He pushed me onto a couch...

29:51.557 --> 29:54.026
he pinned me down...

29:54.060 --> 29:56.062
and he raped me.
- Did you report it?

29:56.095 --> 29:59.065
Did you call the police?

29:59.098 --> 30:01.600
- No, I was--
I was in shock.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.135
I was afraid for my job.

30:03.169 --> 30:07.273
I...I buried
the feelings for months.

30:07.306 --> 30:10.042
I had trouble sleeping
and eating,

30:10.076 --> 30:11.844
being on camera.

30:11.878 --> 30:13.880
Until one day,

30:13.913 --> 30:15.948
I couldn't
keep it in any longer.

30:15.982 --> 30:18.250
I needed to tell the truth.

30:18.284 --> 30:21.921
- At financial and career cost?

30:21.954 --> 30:23.389
- Yeah.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.859
I'll never
work at "HNT" again.

30:26.893 --> 30:29.295
My future is uncertain.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.865
- Thank you.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.102
- Ms. Sorenson,

30:36.135 --> 30:38.337
have you, at any time,
been in contact

30:38.370 --> 30:41.073
with a civil attorney?

30:41.107 --> 30:42.909
- I spoke to someone,
but I decided

30:42.942 --> 30:44.911
not to go that route.
- Are you aware that

30:44.944 --> 30:48.080
four of your former co-workers
are filing a civil suit

30:48.114 --> 30:51.250
against "HNT"
and Harold Coyle?

30:51.283 --> 30:53.285
- Yes.
- And I'm sure you're aware

30:53.319 --> 30:57.189
of the recent spate of
sexual harassment complaints,

30:57.223 --> 31:00.927
with women in your position
scoring settlements

31:00.960 --> 31:03.029
in the tens of millions?

31:03.062 --> 31:04.430
- Yes, I'm aware.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.934
- Yet you're not
pursuing that route.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.236
- No.
- Not ever?

31:10.269 --> 31:13.973
Or just not now?
You're a smart woman.

31:14.006 --> 31:15.942
Are you waiting until after
the disposition

31:15.975 --> 31:18.077
of the criminal trial,
which would be a smart strategy?

31:18.110 --> 31:20.246
- Objection.
- Sustained.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.982
- Nothing further.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.652
- You may step down,
Ms. Sorenson.

31:30.122 --> 31:32.058
Next witness, Mr. Barba.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.927
- I'll need a recess,
Your Honor.

31:34.961 --> 31:37.463
- Court is in recess.
We will resume after lunch.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.131
[gavel pounds]

31:42.268 --> 31:43.669
- Where is George Thanos?
- He's not coming.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.337
He just texted me.
- With no explanation.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.406
- Coyle must've got to him.
- Find out.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.378
- Heidi will be fine;
she'll get paid.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.446
Corporate wants this
to go away.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.248
- Yeah, that's understandable,
but it doesn't change the fact

31:56.282 --> 31:58.184
that Harold Coyle
is guilty of sexual assault.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.651
- I'm telling you,
I can't testify.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.954
- What the hell's going on
here, George?

32:01.988 --> 32:04.290
Is this about your contract?
- No, Coyle won't even extend

32:04.323 --> 32:06.192
the courtesy of a bribe.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.094
His trolls are going after
my daughter.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.062
She's got a juvie record
for drugs they got a hold of.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.330
They're threatening
to go public.

32:11.363 --> 32:14.133
It would devastate her.
- We could subpoena you.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.302
- We all know how that goes.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.370
I still have a chance to protect
one woman in my life

32:28.547 --> 32:28.714
.

32:28.747 --> 32:29.481
- I've worked at "HNT"
for four years.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.452
Harold has always behaved
like a gentleman,

32:33.485 --> 32:35.287
a mentor, a great boss.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.456
- What was your impression
of Heidi Sorenson's

32:37.489 --> 32:39.591
relationship with Harold?

32:39.625 --> 32:42.428
- I never sensed a problem
or issue.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.729
Heidi was always so upbeat.

32:43.762 --> 32:46.398
- So she never expressed
any dissatisfaction,

32:46.432 --> 32:48.467
or complained about
being harassed?

32:48.500 --> 32:51.737
- Never.
Heidi seemed to love her job.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.705
- Your Honor, objection
to this line of questioning.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.341
It's pure speculation.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.443
- Overruled,
but move along, Mr. Pace.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.245
- Tuesday, January 3rd
of this year,

32:59.278 --> 33:01.680
did you see Heidi?
- Yes.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.616
We spent about an hour
in hair and make-up together.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.753
- How was Heidi's mood?
- Happy.

33:07.786 --> 33:10.289
Sunny.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.723
She was telling me
how much fun she had

33:11.757 --> 33:14.393
on New Year's Eve at
the Ritz Carlton in Puerto Rico.

33:14.426 --> 33:15.694
- So not the demeanor of a woman

33:15.727 --> 33:17.696
who had allegedly been raped?
- Objection.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.632
- Sustained.
- Nothing further.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.768
- Ms. Evans,

33:22.801 --> 33:24.736
you replaced Heidi
on "HNT's" morning show

33:24.770 --> 33:28.307
after she accused Harold Coyle
of sexual assault, correct?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.642
- That's right,
but the conversations had been

33:30.676 --> 33:32.411
on-going for months.
- And was part of

33:32.444 --> 33:34.480
those conversations your new
salary for your new job?

33:37.549 --> 33:40.552
$10 million a year?

33:40.586 --> 33:42.621
That in the ballpark?

33:49.395 --> 33:51.563
- So the jury has to decide
whether they're gonna

33:51.597 --> 33:53.532
believe me or Margery?

33:53.565 --> 33:55.334
- You know what?
Let's get you out of here.

33:55.367 --> 33:58.370
- No.
I just wanna ask her why.

34:00.606 --> 34:03.442
Do you really have no idea
what kind of a man

34:03.475 --> 34:05.344
Harold Coyle is?
- If you think I'm happy

34:05.377 --> 34:08.280
about any of this, I'm not.
- Then why defend him?

34:08.314 --> 34:10.449
- I believe in loyalty.
- Not to me.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.684
Not to the dozens of women
that Harold harassed.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.653
- That's not my experience.
- Let's go.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.588
- No,
she needs to hear this.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.624
He promised you my job.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.759
What else did he promise you?

34:20.792 --> 34:22.794
There's a cost, Margery.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.497
- You know, you may think
that you have to do

34:25.531 --> 34:27.566
whatever Coyle asks of you.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.435
Perjure yourself on the stand,

34:29.468 --> 34:31.537
let him treat you
like you have no value,

34:31.570 --> 34:34.706
and then just discard you
when he's through.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.375
It doesn't have
to be that way.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.610
- He would never
do that to me.

34:38.644 --> 34:41.447
Never.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.150
I'm sorry for whatever it was
that happened to you...

34:46.485 --> 34:48.487
But I'm not you.

35:10.676 --> 35:13.712
- Margery?
What a surprise.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.881
- I'm just checking in.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.116
- Come in.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.889
I am so happy you came.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.924
- I thought I'd see
how you were doing

35:25.957 --> 35:27.626
with all of this.
- Ha.

35:27.659 --> 35:31.363
Actually, I'm doing great.
We should celebrate.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.532
Drink?

35:33.565 --> 35:35.601
- You do know
the trial's not over yet.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.736
- Yes, it is.

35:37.769 --> 35:40.506
The jury's looking at Heidi
and you know what they see?

35:40.539 --> 35:43.175
A cold, calculating,

35:43.209 --> 35:44.910
aging career woman

35:44.943 --> 35:47.179
with dollar signs
in her sights.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.683
- But you did rape her.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.721
- The truth isn't important.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.957
What's important is what you can
get people to believe.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.561
Now,
how about that celebration?

36:02.594 --> 36:05.531
- I like that idea.
- [chuckles]

36:05.564 --> 36:06.932
[glasses clink]

36:06.965 --> 36:08.400
- What'd you have in mind?

36:08.434 --> 36:10.602
- I can think of
a lot of things.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.938
- I like the way you think.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.974
- But first...
I've been a good soldier

36:16.007 --> 36:18.244
all these months.
Loyal.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.711
- Mm.
Absolutely.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.514
- Defending you
and taking the stand.

36:22.548 --> 36:25.751
Now I need a show
of good faith.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.655
I want my tape back.

36:34.926 --> 36:38.464
- Margery, I'd never use
that tape against you.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.766
Ever.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.569
Too much respect for you.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.437
- Well, then, respectfully,

36:45.471 --> 36:47.273
I'd like it back.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.675
Wherever you keep those tapes,

36:49.708 --> 36:53.579
you get mine
and hand it over.

36:53.612 --> 36:56.282
I'll wait.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.684
- Wow.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.752
Now you're demanding.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.556
- I'm serious, Harold.

37:04.590 --> 37:05.824
Now that I have
the new position,

37:05.857 --> 37:07.593
we can start over.

37:07.626 --> 37:10.829
Have a real,
professional relationship.

37:11.897 --> 37:15.634
- Actually,
I have another idea.

37:15.667 --> 37:18.904
I have been a gentleman.
I have been patient.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.910
No dancing away tonight.
Tonight...

37:24.943 --> 37:27.846
if you want to keep that job?

37:27.879 --> 37:29.981
It's time to show me
how much.

37:32.984 --> 37:35.020
Take off your clothes.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.526
Get on your knees.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.763
Margery...

37:46.097 --> 37:47.633
Come on now.
- [gasps]

37:47.666 --> 37:49.335
- Come on.
Take off your clothes.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.936
Get on your knees.
- Get off of me.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.004
- Do it.
You know you want to.

37:53.038 --> 37:55.006
- Harold, stop!
Get off me!

37:55.040 --> 37:56.942
[static droning]

37:56.975 --> 38:00.346
I managed to fight him off
and run out.

38:00.379 --> 38:03.915
- You took a huge risk,
Margery.

38:03.949 --> 38:07.052
- Had to find out
for myself.

38:07.085 --> 38:10.789
I thought I was different.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.824
I wasn't.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.328
I realize I perjured myself
on the stand.

38:16.362 --> 38:17.963
I'm willing to re-testify.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.965
- That's good to hear.

38:19.998 --> 38:23.802
- I'm sorry.
For everything.

38:26.972 --> 38:30.576
What happens now?
- We get this to the ADA.

38:33.144 --> 38:36.014
- Margery...
Come on.

38:36.047 --> 38:39.017
Come on.
Take off your clothes.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.852
Get on your knees.
- No! No!

38:40.886 --> 38:44.022
- So what's on the table?
- Given that with Margery?

38:44.055 --> 38:46.725
We're looking at misdemeanor
forcible touching, at least.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.560
And I'm feeling pretty confident
about an argument for

38:48.594 --> 38:50.862
aggravated sexual assault.
That's a D Felony.

38:50.896 --> 38:53.399
Or...I get the judge

38:53.432 --> 38:55.867
to admit this tape
at Heidi's trial.

38:55.901 --> 38:57.903
The jury sees that,
plus Margery's testimony,

38:57.936 --> 39:01.106
you get convicted
of rape-1.

39:01.139 --> 39:04.743
- This was entrapment--
- Harold, enough.

39:05.777 --> 39:08.013
- [chuckles]
That damn bitch.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.716
- Okay, see you in trial.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.985
- Let's start talking.

39:20.826 --> 39:22.594
- I know it doesn't
look like much now,

39:22.628 --> 39:24.630
but with a few million
from "HNT,"

39:24.663 --> 39:27.165
this will be the new office
space for Step Up.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.435
Mentoring and empowering
teenage girls.

39:29.468 --> 39:32.938
- What an incredible use
of the settlement.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.073
I wasn't sure
you were gonna take it.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.175
- Well,
Margery convinced me.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.412
I'll take some time to travel,
figure out my next move.

39:40.446 --> 39:41.980
Maybe I'll write a tell-all.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.650
- You won't miss the business?

39:44.683 --> 39:46.685
- Actually, no.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.888
For as long as I can remember,
I've been beholden to Coyle

39:49.921 --> 39:53.091
and ratings,
corporate mandates.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.961
You know,
I-I finally feel free.

39:59.665 --> 40:02.968
Thank you, Olivia.

40:03.001 --> 40:06.171
- Congratulations.

40:06.204 --> 40:09.074
Really.
- Thank you.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.142
- Good luck.

40:18.049 --> 40:20.686
Chief, how can I help you?

40:20.719 --> 40:22.020
- I wanted to congratulate you.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.456
"HNT" is back on
their financial heels

40:24.490 --> 40:26.792
and Coyle will do 18 months.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.461
- Well, the guy just
couldn't help himself.

40:29.495 --> 40:31.930
- The tortoise
and the scorpion.

40:31.963 --> 40:33.499
- I'm sorry?

40:33.532 --> 40:35.834
- Scorpion asks a tortoise
for a ride across the lake.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.235
The tortoise says,
"Well, sure,

40:37.268 --> 40:38.937
as long as you don't
sting me."

40:38.970 --> 40:40.472
Scorpion says,
"Why would I sting you?

40:40.506 --> 40:42.841
We'd both drown."
So they start off.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.676
Halfway across the lake,
the scorpion

40:44.710 --> 40:45.844
stings the tortoise.
The tortoise says,

40:45.877 --> 40:47.479
"Why the hell did you do that?"

40:47.513 --> 40:50.215
- And the scorpion says,
"Because it's in my nature."

40:50.248 --> 40:52.450
- Oh, you do know that one.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.189
I guess the scorpions
keep us in business.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.861
- Yeah.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.731
- Well...

41:05.764 --> 41:07.699
I've barged into your office
enough for one week.

41:07.733 --> 41:10.001
- Please, any time.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.105
- I, uh...

41:15.140 --> 41:19.945
I guess I've been avoiding SVU.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.981
Every time I walk in
the place...

41:23.014 --> 41:25.283
I think I'm gonna see Mike...

41:25.316 --> 41:27.553
sitting at his desk.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.858
Is that crazy?
- Nope.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.926
Not at all.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.898
- I'll see you, Olivia.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.208
- I'll see you, Chief.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.886
[sighs]
