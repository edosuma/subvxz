[ growls ]

18:23.643 --> 18:25.979
Go.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.773
Thank you,
Venturestein.

18:29.774 --> 18:31.359
Batman!

18:33.862 --> 18:35.155
BOTH:
Hank!

18:35.238 --> 18:37.824
Hank's gone.
Call me... The Bat.

18:37.907 --> 18:40.243
I'll call you a cab.
I think you've had one too many.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.579
Ah, leave me.
Save yourselves.

18:42.662 --> 18:45.040
Oh, stop with the drama.
You're not hurt that bad.

18:45.123 --> 18:47.709
No, really.
Leave me. I want to stay.

18:47.792 --> 18:50.253
All right, what'd you drink?
You're talking as crazy as Hank now.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.255
Crazy is spending
your whole life

18:52.339 --> 18:54.257
trying to be something
you're not.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.760
I'm a freak, Doc.
A-A monster.

18:56.843 --> 18:58.762
I can't hack it
in the straight world.

18:58.845 --> 19:01.306
I-I want to spend
my autumn years

19:01.389 --> 19:03.808
in a place
where I'll be accepted,

19:03.892 --> 19:06.186
with a vaguely
paramilitary vibe

19:06.269 --> 19:08.647
and absolutely
no children whatsoever.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.107
KARL:
There they are! Slaughter them!

19:11.191 --> 19:12.984
Let's get the fuck
out of here!

19:13.068 --> 19:15.278
To the Hankmobile!

19:15.362 --> 19:17.405
[ Gunfire,
indistinct shouting]

19:32.379 --> 19:34.297
[engine sputters]

Head for the beach.

[ Beeping ]

19:52.607 --> 19:54.234
All right, now what?

19:54.317 --> 19:56.236
Tell me you've
got a Hank-boat.

19:56.319 --> 19:57.696
Wait for it!

19:57.779 --> 19:59.698
In 5... 4...

19:59.781 --> 20:01.658
3...

20:04.411 --> 20:05.704
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.747
The jungle's no place
for a jPad.

20:07.831 --> 20:11.251
They get wet, the warranty
is voided -- awful.

20:11.334 --> 20:13.545
[sighs] I got
nothing left, Pop.

20:13.628 --> 20:15.505
I'm getting drowsy.
Whoo.

20:15.588 --> 20:17.507
Shouldn't have had that
big crab dinner

20:17.590 --> 20:18.675
before the mission.

20:18.758 --> 20:21.928
No, look, l-l'm not like
the other scientists, okay?

20:22.011 --> 20:24.097
You wanna know what Venturestein
was doing before this?

20:24.180 --> 20:25.640
He was dead!

20:25.724 --> 20:27.058
And before that,
he was a henchman

20:27.142 --> 20:29.519
for some prick
in a butterfly costume.

20:29.602 --> 20:30.729
Two, actually.

20:30.812 --> 20:35.066
I saved him!
I gave him life!

20:35.150 --> 20:37.402
[all whimpering]

20:37.485 --> 20:38.737
[ Beeping excitedly]

20:38.820 --> 20:40.697
H.E.L.P.Er.!
Thank heaven!

Kill these guys!

Wait! Look!

VENTURESTEIN:
You see, comrades?

20:55.462 --> 20:58.631
Is glorious new dawn
Venturestein promise.

20:58.715 --> 21:03.928
Abomi-nation all come --
by sea and by air!

21:07.474 --> 21:09.851
Excuse me!
Pardon-a me!

21:09.934 --> 21:11.436
That man you're holding

21:11.519 --> 21:13.438
is a citizen of
the United States!

21:13.521 --> 21:15.023
I am Congresswoman
Marsha Backwood,

21:15.106 --> 21:17.859
and I am here
to negotiate h--

Oh, did somebody lose
an iPad?

21:20.487 --> 21:23.323
[ All scream ]

21:23.406 --> 21:25.617
Yeah, I can fix this.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.620
[ Up-tempo music plays]

21:53.061 --> 21:55.230
And fresh from her recent
fact-finding mission,

21:55.313 --> 21:56.898
here to give us her unique
perspective

21:56.981 --> 21:58.775
on this Puerto Bahia situation

21:58.858 --> 22:00.985

Thank you,
Mr. Secretary-General.

I here today tell all --

Abomi-nation proud,
hearty people.
