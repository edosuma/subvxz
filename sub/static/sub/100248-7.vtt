WEBVTT

00:28.125 --> 00:31.416
Where would you be headin',
little thief?

00:31.875 --> 00:33.041
Skellige.

00:33.125 --> 00:34.208
Hmm.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.916
Do you know how long it is
to the coast?

00:38.458 --> 00:39.791
With a fast horse,

00:40.541 --> 00:41.500
about a week.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.416
And what about by foot?

00:47.041 --> 00:48.541
You need to be careful, child.

00:49.375 --> 00:51.291
This place isn't safe if you're alone.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.250
Then it's the same as every other place.

01:46.625 --> 01:48.750
Out of nowhere, you send word to meet you.

01:49.291 --> 01:51.333
All this time, I thought you were dead.

01:51.416 --> 01:55.000
I told you last time I was in Cintra
that I wasn't coming back.

01:55.333 --> 01:56.708
Yet here you are.

01:58.291 --> 01:59.125
Why?

02:01.375 --> 02:03.333
You've come for your Child of Surprise...

02:03.791 --> 02:04.750
haven't you?

02:04.833 --> 02:05.833
The opposite.

02:05.916 --> 02:09.541
I want you to tell me that he's safe
and healthy so I can keep on riding.

02:09.625 --> 02:10.458
He...

02:11.583 --> 02:12.750
is a girl.

02:15.083 --> 02:15.958
Yes.

02:16.416 --> 02:20.041
Princess Cirilla has been raised
by Calanthe since her parents died.

02:21.083 --> 02:21.916
What?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.583
Pavetta and Duny's ship was lost at sea.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.083
Have you been hiding your head
in the sand?

02:30.500 --> 02:31.500
Why now?

02:33.416 --> 02:35.666
Why do you think she's not safe?

02:36.708 --> 02:39.166
I saw an army making camp
at the Amell Pass.

02:40.250 --> 02:42.083
A sea of black and gold.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.958
Nilfgaard is set
on sweeping the Continent.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.375
But since that night at Pavetta's banquet,

02:48.458 --> 02:52.583
the Queen's done everything she can
to keep her family safe from threats.

02:53.291 --> 02:54.791
Shut the walls.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.041
Fortified the gates.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.291
Sent assassins!

03:01.708 --> 03:02.541
What?

03:03.083 --> 03:04.500
Were you followed?

03:05.208 --> 03:06.041
No!

03:06.416 --> 03:07.458
Hmm.

03:56.458 --> 03:57.541
Hmm?

03:59.291 --> 04:00.125
Hmm.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.250
You want me, you kill him first!

04:15.833 --> 04:16.708
Geralt!

04:19.666 --> 04:20.875
Do something!

04:20.958 --> 04:23.625
-This is on your Queen.
-We will both die.

04:24.083 --> 04:25.500
Blame destiny.

04:44.708 --> 04:47.041
The Nilfgaardians don't strike me
as foolish.

04:47.541 --> 04:49.541
Coming at us now would be right stupid.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.166
The army whose stink I can smell
on a strong breeze is one I worry about.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.416
So we prepare, same as always.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.166
When does the King return from Skellige,
Your Majesty?

05:01.250 --> 05:04.125
This morning.
Be good to see that craggy face.

05:04.208 --> 05:06.875
Be better to see the 50 ships
the Skelligens promised.

05:08.625 --> 05:09.583
Your Majesty.

05:10.541 --> 05:11.958
No offense taken, Danek.

05:12.916 --> 05:13.916
You know I agree.

05:14.416 --> 05:17.500
We've taken on every pissant pretender
for a dozen years.

05:18.208 --> 05:20.791
If Nilfgaard need to learn the lesson
the rest of them have,

05:20.875 --> 05:22.500
we'll be ready for them.

05:22.583 --> 05:25.375
I want reports from the Amell Pass
every hour...

05:33.083 --> 05:35.000
I warned you about coming back.

05:35.458 --> 05:39.583
I've been away 12 years
and I'd planned on staying that way...

05:40.041 --> 05:41.833
till you sent eight men to kill me.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.000
Well, I'm asking you now.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.166
Do not do this.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.958
If you treated me more like a friend
than a threat...

05:55.416 --> 05:57.625
Do you know the difference anymore?

06:00.416 --> 06:01.375
I'm here

06:01.875 --> 06:03.125
to protect the girl.

06:03.791 --> 06:05.708
Who I've raised as my own.

06:06.541 --> 06:08.041
Why would I give my only heir

06:08.125 --> 06:10.833
to someone who never cared enough
to come back for her?

06:11.708 --> 06:14.166
Move along, Witcher.
I'll pay whatever you want.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.791
I can't be bought.

06:18.666 --> 06:19.958
You should remember.

06:20.041 --> 06:23.083
Money can't undo the Law of Surprise.

06:24.291 --> 06:27.791
Kings who've tried to outbid destiny

06:27.875 --> 06:29.458
end up on pikes.

06:30.208 --> 06:32.750
And if I win the war but lose Ciri,

06:33.375 --> 06:35.166
what victory is that?

06:38.708 --> 06:42.291
Maybe that army won't come,
and if they do, maybe you'll be ready.

06:42.375 --> 06:45.791
But if you have any doubt in your mind
that she's safe here,

06:46.541 --> 06:47.625
give her to me.

06:47.708 --> 06:51.291
Call it destiny, security,
what larger forces at work,

06:51.666 --> 06:52.708
I don't care.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.583
I will take her, protect her,

06:56.291 --> 06:58.875
and bring her back unharmed,
I promise you that.

07:01.541 --> 07:03.625
Ciri is all I have left of my daughter.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.208
If Ciri survives,
then Pavetta lives on too.

07:19.458 --> 07:21.708
Law of Surprise has been called.

07:22.958 --> 07:24.708
I'll tell Cirilla myself.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.833
Oh, sweet Cintra, you were so promising,

07:29.916 --> 07:33.166
from your spoiled princess
to your stupid old king!

07:33.250 --> 07:35.708
But when I arrived,
the royals were dead!

07:35.791 --> 07:37.375
Tossed out a window or shot in the head!

07:37.458 --> 07:40.166
So, what to do now?
Where's the devil to go?

07:40.250 --> 07:42.500
Anywhere but here. Back in your hole!

07:42.583 --> 07:44.750
No, don't cast me out on a whim!

07:44.833 --> 07:46.833
Who needs you when I've got him?

08:06.708 --> 08:07.583
Hey!

08:16.666 --> 08:18.375
Where'd you get a piece like this?

08:19.458 --> 08:20.625
It was my mother's.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.166
Hey, girl!

08:32.208 --> 08:34.125
What's so special about Skellige?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.333
Those roads aren't safe,

08:39.916 --> 08:41.750
and the Skelligens are a grumpy lot.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.041
How about this?

08:44.458 --> 08:45.458
Come with me.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.458
I've got one more thing to buy.

08:48.833 --> 08:50.833
and then we'll make room
on Clip and Clop

08:51.458 --> 08:52.583
and be home by dark.

08:53.958 --> 08:57.291
We don't have much,
but we've got a sight more than you do.

08:57.375 --> 08:58.250
Roof,

08:58.791 --> 09:01.041
food, space on the floor to sleep.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.958
A lot's happening on this Continent,
but we're safer when we stick together.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.250
Okay?

09:10.333 --> 09:11.166
Grand.

09:41.958 --> 09:43.708
It's what has been promised.

09:46.541 --> 09:49.541
We must sacrifice... to fulfill destiny.

09:54.416 --> 09:55.583
Shh...

10:04.375 --> 10:05.583
He may take you,

10:07.541 --> 10:09.416
but you will always be mine.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.916
I need you to be brave now,
because who are you?

10:15.833 --> 10:17.250
The Lion Cub of Cintra.

10:29.708 --> 10:31.291
Pleased to meet you, Princess.

10:37.041 --> 10:40.000
-Can I say goodbye to my friends now?
-Of course.

10:48.458 --> 10:50.125
I'll summon you when she's ready.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.666
Go on, Korin, do it!
Oh! Gimme.

12:07.583 --> 12:09.958
Korin, Anton, I have to go.

12:10.041 --> 12:11.333
-What? No!
-I know!

12:13.583 --> 12:14.500
Take care.

12:15.458 --> 12:16.458
Your Highness.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.000
Throw those knuckles.

12:35.833 --> 12:38.625
First, you try to kill me,
then you lie to me.

12:39.708 --> 12:41.875
I'm just trying to keep Cirilla safe.

12:42.333 --> 12:46.458
Ciri is safe, with me,
until the day she takes over my throne.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.208
-Listen to me.
-I did listen once.

12:49.291 --> 12:51.041
Let a hedgehog into my court.

12:51.541 --> 12:53.458
It got me Pavetta dead.

12:54.166 --> 12:55.666
I won't lose Ciri too.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.958
So you and destiny
can both fuck right off.

12:59.541 --> 13:03.500
Because if Nilfgaard comes,
will destiny carry a banner into battle?

13:04.041 --> 13:05.000
No.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.166
We have an army, a navy...

13:08.166 --> 13:09.000
and me.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.791
A dynasty can't survive
on arrogance alone.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.208
Says a witcher.

13:13.875 --> 13:15.625
She needs family.

13:15.708 --> 13:17.625
You know nothing about that.

13:17.708 --> 13:20.375
Your own mother cared so little,
she discarded you.

13:21.500 --> 13:25.375
You lecture me on a mother's love
yet offer up someone else's daughter.

13:27.291 --> 13:30.458
Queen to all of Cintra,
grandmother to one.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.541
I won't orphan that girl.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.291
You're sentencing her to death.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.375
-What did I miss?
-Nothing.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.333
Get him out of my sight.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.958
I remember
when you honored the Law of Surprise.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.833
What changed?

13:47.916 --> 13:49.166
I had a granddaughter.

13:49.250 --> 13:50.458
So protect her.

13:51.041 --> 13:53.041
-Your Majesty.
-What if Calanthe's wrong?

13:53.416 --> 13:55.500
What if they come and Ciri is trapped?

13:55.583 --> 13:57.708
I fight side by side with my Queen.

13:58.625 --> 14:00.625
You put too much faith in that woman.

14:00.708 --> 14:02.125
Well, you weren't there.

14:03.750 --> 14:07.708
After Pavetta died, Calanthe would
wake up howling in the night.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.791
The Lioness, nearly broken.

14:11.875 --> 14:14.666
Someone who's able to pull themselves
out of that,

14:14.750 --> 14:17.083
they'll have my confidence
till my final day.

14:23.708 --> 14:25.750
I need your promise you won't come back.

14:29.166 --> 14:30.833
If I hear Ciri's in danger,

14:32.250 --> 14:33.583
you know I can't do that.

14:37.791 --> 14:38.791
I know.

14:50.708 --> 14:51.875
Just move it!

14:52.750 --> 14:54.208
Faster!

14:55.250 --> 14:57.833
That's right!
No water till you've finished!

15:01.125 --> 15:02.291
Move it!

15:04.208 --> 15:05.375
That's right!

15:08.083 --> 15:09.750
All right, ditch diggers!

15:09.833 --> 15:10.833
Move it!

15:19.208 --> 15:21.708
Report any findings immediately!

15:23.458 --> 15:27.041
All visitors must declare themselves
to the officers!

15:28.000 --> 15:29.750
Is it cleared yet?

15:30.291 --> 15:31.416
Safe conduct?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.083
You're coming from Caingorn?

15:41.500 --> 15:43.083
How long will you be in Nazair?

15:44.500 --> 15:46.000
That is yet to be determined.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.375
Hello, Yennefer.

16:03.916 --> 16:06.208
The... the runes described a...

16:06.291 --> 16:10.125
a "magnalith" in Nazair,
but no one could find it till I got here.

16:10.875 --> 16:13.708
Until Nilfgaard tore
through all the lands.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.875
They allow my research.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.041
That's all I care about.

16:19.125 --> 16:21.250
Hmm. A man of principle.

16:25.041 --> 16:26.791
You don't understand.
Every glyph has a clue

16:26.875 --> 16:28.666
-to something across the Continent...

16:28.750 --> 16:30.708
...from a time before the Conjunction.

16:31.041 --> 16:33.333
Most are history, but some might be more.

16:33.416 --> 16:36.166
The prophecy, the future,
I want to explore all of it.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.583
Wow.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.083
That's a face. You hate it that much?

16:44.166 --> 16:45.750
Only because I have taste buds.

16:46.166 --> 16:48.625
Well, these people were starving
before Nilfgaard.

16:49.375 --> 16:52.541
See, most kings only care
about their cocks and their coffers.

16:53.083 --> 16:55.916
They look out for their people.
Everybody gets something.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.166
The same thing,

16:57.583 --> 16:59.833
which tastes as if someone pissed
in my cup.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.708
Sounds to me like you bought in.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.833
No. No, it's, uh...

17:08.333 --> 17:09.333
It's just that...

17:11.750 --> 17:13.625
sometimes, boring is better.

17:15.875 --> 17:16.791
No, it's not.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.583
Come on.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.708
<i>How long do you see yourself here?</i>

17:32.916 --> 17:35.208
There's a lot of hill left to dig. Why?

17:39.166 --> 17:40.750
Because I may be missing you.

17:44.916 --> 17:47.291
See, the Yennefer I remember
didn't miss anyone.

17:47.375 --> 17:48.541
Yeah, well...

17:54.958 --> 17:56.083
What if...

17:58.500 --> 18:02.000
it's not too late
for what we talked about in the cave?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.291
We could go somewhere with,

18:05.708 --> 18:07.416
I don't know, two types of ale.

18:08.041 --> 18:08.958
You could...

18:09.791 --> 18:11.000
play with your rocks,

18:12.041 --> 18:13.458
and I'll work as a mage.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.333
You hate monoliths.

18:16.416 --> 18:17.791
-Yes, but--
-But what?

18:20.041 --> 18:22.166
I mean, look at you.
You could have anyone.

18:22.666 --> 18:23.583
I have.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.708
And it was fun to be wanted.

18:28.291 --> 18:29.750
The object of desire.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.083
After where I came from, I lapped it up.

18:36.166 --> 18:40.500
But they all loved the power
that came with my position at court.

18:43.750 --> 18:44.916
Not my power.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.791
And no one's ever seen that but me?

19:21.916 --> 19:22.750
You know,

19:23.625 --> 19:24.625
I spent...

19:25.958 --> 19:27.416
I spent years...

19:28.541 --> 19:32.041
waiting for this moment where
you realized we're meant for each other.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.125
You know, coming up with excuses
to study at Aedirn.

19:38.666 --> 19:42.333
Henges, dead languages, anything
to get closer to you again, and....

19:44.708 --> 19:46.958
every request I made was denied.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.791
You shut them all down.

20:01.208 --> 20:03.625
Stregobor, of all people,
snapped me out of it.

20:05.583 --> 20:08.583
"Forget about the girl.
Get back to work." And work saved me.

20:10.458 --> 20:13.208
Remembered why I loved it.
The beauty, the purity. No...

20:15.958 --> 20:17.708
distractions when I'm in it.

20:21.833 --> 20:23.583
You went after the thing you loved.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.791
So you chose power.

20:41.791 --> 20:43.250
At least you kept your eyes.

21:01.125 --> 21:02.125
His loss.

21:02.625 --> 21:03.625
Piss off.

21:04.666 --> 21:06.958
Well, I would,
but we don't have much time.

21:07.041 --> 21:08.208
Who the fuck are you?

21:09.833 --> 21:11.625
I'm Vilgefortz of Roggeveen.

21:12.791 --> 21:13.791
Why are you whispering?

21:19.666 --> 21:23.666
Nilfgaard is conscripting mages
like us into their service.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.916
Now, since...

21:28.083 --> 21:30.041
Now, since I don't have a letter
of safe conduct,

21:30.125 --> 21:33.166
and yours is probably fake, we should go,

21:33.791 --> 21:35.875
before those lads start asking questions.

21:35.958 --> 21:36.875
Go where?

21:39.333 --> 21:40.291
Aretuza.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.791
Well, the feeling's mutual.

21:45.875 --> 21:47.583
The Chapter thinks you're rash,

21:47.666 --> 21:49.750
unpredictable and dangerous.

21:50.791 --> 21:51.833
But right now,

21:52.541 --> 21:55.041
that's exactly what Tissaia and I need.

21:58.458 --> 21:59.750
Tissaia asked for me?

22:02.166 --> 22:04.666
She said you're the best student
she ever taught.

22:36.958 --> 22:38.166
Let's talk.

22:38.250 --> 22:39.083
About what?

22:39.166 --> 22:40.041
Nilfgaard.

22:40.833 --> 22:44.291
Their army's camped near Cintra,
and we think they're going to attack.

22:44.375 --> 22:45.833
And they won't stop there.

22:45.916 --> 22:48.000
We need allies
from the Northern Kingdoms.

22:48.083 --> 22:51.458
I'll leave this to the people
who actually give a shit. Where's Tissaia?

22:51.875 --> 22:53.041
Tissaia can wait.

22:53.125 --> 22:55.708
Fine, I'll just follow the sound
of crying girls.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.500
She has no idea you're here.

23:00.541 --> 23:01.916
You said she asked for me.

23:02.000 --> 23:02.833
No.

23:03.500 --> 23:06.166
I told you that she said
you were her best student.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.750
I'm the one that wants you here.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.333
It took five minutes
for the lies to start.

23:12.416 --> 23:15.875
Why did I expect anything else
from a place held together by bullshit?

23:24.041 --> 23:27.541
<i>Do you know how many</i>
<i>people wouldn't blink if you died?</i>

23:32.208 --> 23:34.208
- <i>Let me out!</i>

23:34.291 --> 23:35.416
<i>Let me out!</i>

23:41.875 --> 23:45.125
<i>Sometimes, the best thing</i>
<i>a flower can do for us is die.</i>

23:47.875 --> 23:49.666
<i>You should've let me die.</i>

23:49.750 --> 23:51.583
<i>At least I had control over that.</i>

23:52.541 --> 23:55.083
<i>Mm, that's adorable, piglet.</i>

23:57.458 --> 23:58.916
<i>You weren't taking control,</i>

23:59.875 --> 24:01.083
<i>you were losing it.</i>

24:01.958 --> 24:04.625
- <i>You were losing it.</i>
-What the hell's going on in here?

24:06.125 --> 24:07.958
We were studying. Botany.

24:12.208 --> 24:15.875
If I gave Rectress de Vries  your pitiful
excuse about that pitiful plant,

24:16.416 --> 24:17.875
I'd be gone by nightfall.

24:23.416 --> 24:25.375
But fuck that old bag!

24:32.000 --> 24:33.208
This was my room.

24:34.791 --> 24:36.416
Before anyone you know was born.

24:37.416 --> 24:38.666
So, you've been to court?

24:43.958 --> 24:44.875
Aedirn.

24:49.375 --> 24:50.500
It's very elegant.

24:51.625 --> 24:53.875
-Very boring.
-Why are you back, then?

24:55.958 --> 24:57.083
Why <i>am </i>I back?

25:24.166 --> 25:26.375
I bet you hate botany as much as I did.

25:34.541 --> 25:37.250
Who wants to know
what those herbs are really good for?

25:47.708 --> 25:49.791
Rhwydwaith carthion.

25:50.791 --> 25:53.333
They've taught you
about its healing powers

25:53.416 --> 25:54.833
and fortifying blah, blah, blah.

25:55.291 --> 25:58.875
But they leave out
that if you mix these two together,

25:59.333 --> 26:01.541
you'll see colors like never...

26:02.750 --> 26:03.583
before.

26:04.791 --> 26:07.041
Miss tells us never to mix herbs.

26:09.166 --> 26:12.041
They tell you that so you have to go
to them for all the answers.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.208
<i>A word of advice.</i>

26:14.916 --> 26:16.791
Think for yourselves.

26:18.916 --> 26:21.000
It'll save you a lifetime of heartbreak.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.958
<i>The ceiling's melting.</i>

26:24.416 --> 26:25.458
<i>No.</i>

26:25.541 --> 26:26.916
The herbs are working.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.125
- <i>Well, I don't feel...</i>

26:30.208 --> 26:32.208
-What was I saying?

26:33.250 --> 26:34.583
Gods, you're pretty.

26:36.958 --> 26:38.166
Oh, don't worry, Fola.

26:38.250 --> 26:39.916
You'll look like that too.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Nobody starts off that way.

26:42.083 --> 26:45.166
-You want to know a secret?
<i>-Nobody starts off that way.</i>

26:45.250 --> 26:46.250
It's overrated.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.625
Look, I'm levitating!

26:49.708 --> 26:51.166
<i>Levitating, I'm levitating.</i>

26:51.250 --> 26:54.625
Glacella, whatever you lack
in talent, you make up for in confidence.

26:54.708 --> 26:57.291
She doesn't need confidence.
Her father owns half of Creyden.

26:57.375 --> 26:59.791
So he could swap a hundred horses
for her spot here.

27:04.041 --> 27:06.458
Your parents paid Aretuza?

27:08.916 --> 27:11.791
The Chapter decided it needed students
from the best families.

27:13.291 --> 27:15.541
But you all must have had
a conduit moment?

27:16.500 --> 27:19.791
We shouldn't be mixing herbs.
We shouldn't even be here.

27:22.916 --> 27:25.666
You know, if they catch us,
they really will expel us.

27:25.750 --> 27:27.708
There are far worse things than expulsion.

27:30.666 --> 27:31.666
Like what?

27:50.541 --> 27:52.000
What is this place?

27:52.083 --> 27:53.416
Aretuza's windmill.

27:54.166 --> 27:56.666
Enough bridled chaos
to keep the curtains hung...

27:57.208 --> 27:59.875
and the torches lit,
but that's not what we're here for.

28:03.416 --> 28:07.000
- I think we should go.
- Wait. I've got so many questions.

28:08.833 --> 28:10.541
You want to know more.

28:10.625 --> 28:11.458
Yes.

28:12.666 --> 28:13.500
Everything.

28:22.583 --> 28:24.708
The ability to create life,

28:26.375 --> 28:27.541
real life,

28:30.791 --> 28:32.458
they take that from you.

28:36.666 --> 28:38.083
And then send you out,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.583
so the only family,
the only loyalty you have,

28:41.666 --> 28:42.666
is to them.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.583
And you'll trade it all for what?

28:48.375 --> 28:49.708
<i>Looks that never change.</i>

28:50.916 --> 28:52.375
<i>A court full of idiots.</i>

28:55.958 --> 28:57.500
But you don't have to do it.

28:57.916 --> 28:59.041
But what if I want to?

28:59.583 --> 29:01.958
-We're leaving. Come on.
-Lesson's not over yet!

29:02.041 --> 29:03.916
Just because you fucked up,
doesn't mean we will.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.583
-You?
-Come on.

29:05.666 --> 29:07.583
With all the magical talent
of shoe leather?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.583
You'll have a home here forever,
Glacella.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.375
Right here.

29:17.166 --> 29:19.291
With my sisters who never ascended.

29:23.916 --> 29:25.041
What's happening?

29:30.541 --> 29:31.750
Anica, is that you?

29:33.875 --> 29:36.083
<i>You turned my friend into a slug.</i>

29:36.166 --> 29:37.708
<i>An eel.</i>

29:39.041 --> 29:41.291
<i>Come, push your friend into the pool.</i>

29:43.708 --> 29:46.500
<i>I don't care what you do,</i>
<i>but remember this.</i>

29:46.583 --> 29:48.500
<i>Even if you do everything right,</i>

29:48.583 --> 29:50.041
<i>follow their rules,</i>

29:50.125 --> 29:52.500
<i>that's still no guarantee</i>
<i>you'll get what you want.</i>

29:52.583 --> 29:53.666
Enough!

29:55.125 --> 29:56.666
Back to your rooms, girls.

30:08.333 --> 30:09.583
You ruined one life.

30:11.291 --> 30:12.291
Stop there.

30:21.708 --> 30:23.625
I never even wanted to come back here!

30:24.625 --> 30:27.583
Then you failed at that, too.

30:28.250 --> 30:29.458
Look at this place.

30:30.291 --> 30:31.333
It's a joke.

30:32.791 --> 30:34.916
Letting in girls who can't even do magic!

30:35.416 --> 30:38.125
Sometimes, you have to compromise
in order to survive.

30:38.625 --> 30:42.041
You say I never took responsibility
for the way my life turned out.

30:42.125 --> 30:42.958
What about you?

30:43.750 --> 30:45.708
But what's happening?
I don't understand...

30:45.791 --> 30:47.041
What's going on?

30:47.125 --> 30:48.166
It's happening.

30:50.625 --> 30:51.500
Triss!

30:53.833 --> 30:54.666
Yennefer.

30:55.625 --> 30:58.166
-I tried finding you for years.
-Why are you all here?

30:58.250 --> 31:00.541
An emergency conclave
of the Northern Mages.

31:01.041 --> 31:03.583
-Nilfgaard took Marnadal.
-What?

31:03.666 --> 31:05.000
They're attacking Cintra.

31:06.041 --> 31:09.083
<i>Going to war against Nilfgaard</i>
<i>is madness.</i>

31:09.166 --> 31:10.291
And for Cintra?

31:11.291 --> 31:15.458
They've rejected our mages for decades,
so let's grant them their wish.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.166
It's not just about Cintra.

31:17.916 --> 31:20.750
Nilfgaard won't be satisfied
until they have the whole Continent.

31:20.833 --> 31:24.000
-And how do you know this?
-Because that's the same lie I would tell.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.458
I'm the only one here
that's led soldiers into battle.

31:26.541 --> 31:28.083
Oh, yes, and don't we know it?

31:28.166 --> 31:29.500
You wear your silly costume

31:29.583 --> 31:31.083
-every chance you get.

31:31.166 --> 31:36.333
All those years swinging his sword around
were years he wasn't serving as a mage.

31:36.416 --> 31:39.375
Or killing babies born at an eclipse.

31:41.916 --> 31:46.333
We can stop Nilfgaard, if we act now.

31:47.250 --> 31:49.583
The south... well, is the south.

31:49.666 --> 31:51.666
It is up to the north to unite.

31:52.041 --> 31:55.708
It is time to convince our kings
to send their armies.

31:55.791 --> 31:56.875
They could cross the Yaruga,

31:57.833 --> 31:59.625
make it to Sodden by week's end.

31:59.708 --> 32:00.708
They could save Cintra.

32:00.791 --> 32:02.625
If Cintra falls, who cares?

32:02.708 --> 32:03.916
- I care!

32:04.000 --> 32:06.083
Because our kingdoms will be next.

32:08.500 --> 32:12.458
Our fight is with Cintra, and only Cintra.

32:13.916 --> 32:17.166
In Nilfgaard, we know what it's like
to have corrupt leaders.

32:17.250 --> 32:21.125
But under our new leader,
Emperor Emhyr, we've changed.

32:21.958 --> 32:23.625
We've strengthened trade.

32:23.708 --> 32:24.833
We've funded research.

32:24.916 --> 32:26.583
We have torn down walls,

32:26.666 --> 32:29.750
whilst Queen Calanthe has done nothing
but put them up.

32:29.833 --> 32:32.875
I am not here to defend Cintra.

32:33.875 --> 32:36.208
But I will defend our way of life.

32:36.916 --> 32:39.166
The Brotherhood, the Academies,

32:39.250 --> 32:42.666
the order that we have built up
over centuries.

32:42.750 --> 32:45.125
You've rejected it all, Fringilla.

32:45.208 --> 32:47.500
Not true. We've modified it.

32:47.583 --> 32:49.708
Most of us came from Aretuza
and Ban Ard.

32:49.791 --> 32:52.208
We've simply charted a different path,

32:52.291 --> 32:53.666
guided by the White Flame.

32:54.208 --> 32:56.208
That makes us cousins, not enemies.

32:56.291 --> 32:58.416
You force mages into servitude!

32:58.500 --> 33:01.208
When in training, yes.
Like soldiers.

33:01.291 --> 33:03.041
We believe in shared sacrifice.

33:03.125 --> 33:04.958
You also believe
in forbidden magic.

33:05.041 --> 33:07.166
Demonology, necromancy, fire magic!

33:07.250 --> 33:10.875
Forbidden magic is one
of the ghost stories taught to us here.

33:10.958 --> 33:13.791
There is no such thing as dark
or light magic.

33:14.791 --> 33:17.041
<i>Nothing in this world is</i>
<i>as simple as that.</i>

33:18.750 --> 33:21.541
<i>You think</i>
<i>that we're destroying the Continent.</i>

33:22.416 --> 33:26.833
<i>We know that if we take Cintra,</i>
<i>we have a chance of saving it.</i>

33:28.583 --> 33:32.875
<i>If you won't take sides,</i>
<i>then at least stay out of our way.</i>

33:36.416 --> 33:39.291
<i>Ah, enough</i>
<i>of this tiring debate.</i>

33:39.375 --> 33:41.000
<i>Cintra's a lost cause.</i>

33:41.083 --> 33:42.583
<i>Let them reap what they sow.</i>

33:42.666 --> 33:43.583
I say we vote.

33:43.666 --> 33:45.208
-Yes, vote. Vote!
-Vote?

33:46.208 --> 33:48.125
First, you install
your niece at Nilfgaard,

33:48.208 --> 33:49.791
and now you want to ram through a vote.

33:49.875 --> 33:51.708
To be fair,
Yennefer of Vengerberg

33:51.791 --> 33:53.916
is the one I have to thank for my posting.

33:55.375 --> 33:58.125
If she had taken it,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

33:58.208 --> 33:59.416
Neither would Nilfgaard.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.708
If only Yennefer had gone to Nilfgaard.

34:01.791 --> 34:04.625
With her at the helm,
they'd still be a shitty backwater.

34:06.583 --> 34:07.416
You're right.

34:08.916 --> 34:12.708
Instead, I went to a prized kingdom
and did fuck all for decades.

34:12.791 --> 34:14.166
Just as you taught us.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.833
Helped murderers and rapists
keep their crown.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.458
Maybe it is time for something different.

34:20.541 --> 34:22.625
Pipe down. You-- you don't get a vote.

34:22.708 --> 34:24.375
If I did, I'd vote to burn it all down.

34:24.458 --> 34:25.916
-There! There you have--

34:26.000 --> 34:28.125
-There you have it!
- It's true.

34:28.208 --> 34:31.291
Cintra has chosen to turn its back on us.

34:32.708 --> 34:35.208
They are proud, and smart,
and difficult, yes.

34:36.083 --> 34:38.000
But I'd wager above all else...

34:39.083 --> 34:40.666
-they are scared.
- It's true.

34:41.500 --> 34:44.500
We have called them a lost cause
for years.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.166
But we stopped trying too.

34:47.625 --> 34:49.333
And it is time now...

34:49.791 --> 34:52.791
that we risk not only our lives,
but our pride,

34:53.250 --> 34:54.916
and try again.

35:06.083 --> 35:07.208
With your permission,

35:08.250 --> 35:09.666
all those in favor

35:10.416 --> 35:13.583
of letting Cintra continue
their proud tradition

35:13.666 --> 35:15.541
of fending for themselves?

35:29.750 --> 35:30.666
Well...

35:32.416 --> 35:33.750
there you have it.

35:37.625 --> 35:40.791
I know you hate this place,
but there are girls who need it.

35:41.708 --> 35:45.208
Those who have only ever known chaos
until we teach them control.

35:47.458 --> 35:49.291
You were right, in Rinde.

35:51.083 --> 35:52.875
Aretuza is all I have.

35:55.541 --> 35:57.041
If Nilfgaard wins...

36:06.083 --> 36:09.375
That's why Vilgefortz and I
and some others are going to fight.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.083
You should join us.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.375
Did you hear a word I just said?

36:15.833 --> 36:17.333
Why would I protect this?

36:18.666 --> 36:22.583
If you will not do it for the Brotherhood,
then do it for me.

36:25.208 --> 36:26.041
Please.

36:36.125 --> 36:37.958
Have you ever used that word before?

36:41.375 --> 36:42.458
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

36:42.541 --> 36:44.666
<i>the Nilfgaardians will breach</i>
<i>the castle gates.</i>

36:47.125 --> 36:48.125
<i>Have breached.</i>

36:48.541 --> 36:49.750
Now what?

36:49.833 --> 36:51.291
What do we do?

37:19.500 --> 37:20.541
Hmm.

37:26.708 --> 37:27.708
The Witcher...

37:33.250 --> 37:34.541
I couldn't let him go.

37:36.750 --> 37:38.000
I know what I've done.

37:41.083 --> 37:42.416
He's in the gate keep.

37:48.375 --> 37:49.916
If I can bring him here...

37:50.750 --> 37:51.666
to Ciri...

37:53.125 --> 37:55.875
destiny may yet side with us.

38:00.875 --> 38:01.833
Danek.

38:04.750 --> 38:05.666
It's time.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.458
Wait, where are you going?

38:22.583 --> 38:23.500
Geralt!

38:45.166 --> 38:46.041
Your Majesty...

38:50.708 --> 38:51.708
He's gone.

38:52.291 --> 38:54.041
Looks like he's escaped.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.166
If he is out there,

38:58.166 --> 39:00.125
then there is still hope for her.

39:01.875 --> 39:04.875
-What is it?
-Lazlo, bring her cloak.

39:06.750 --> 39:08.250
What? No!

39:09.541 --> 39:11.916
Continue to be brave. Promise me.

39:12.375 --> 39:14.458
You are the Lion Cub of Cintra.

39:14.541 --> 39:17.125
-You are destined for great things.
-I can't do this without you.

39:17.208 --> 39:19.791
-We must go, Your Highness.
- No!

39:26.375 --> 39:27.250
Go.

39:28.958 --> 39:30.458
The world depends on it.

39:35.458 --> 39:36.666
I love you.

39:40.791 --> 39:43.125
Find Geralt of Rivia.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.583
He is your destiny.

39:49.458 --> 39:50.791
We must go, Your Highness.

40:54.458 --> 40:55.458
Princess, come.

41:15.833 --> 41:18.000
Tell me what I want to know
and you'll live.

41:21.666 --> 41:23.250
I am already saved.

41:39.625 --> 41:40.708
Where is Cirilla?

41:42.291 --> 41:44.875
No one... is left.

41:47.166 --> 41:49.666
Ah... we shall be born anew.<i> </i>

41:49.750 --> 41:51.125
Thus it shall be.

41:51.208 --> 41:52.541
Watch for the signs.

41:52.625 --> 41:54.875
What signs these shall be I say unto--

42:10.125 --> 42:12.083
I should've traded that ring for food.

42:14.041 --> 42:15.083
You're right, Clop.

42:16.125 --> 42:17.208
Or are you Clip?

42:19.166 --> 42:22.416
Gods, what kind of crazy person
talks to a horse?

43:01.291 --> 43:02.250
It's all right.

43:04.875 --> 43:06.250
It's all right. We're Cintrans.

43:08.375 --> 43:09.250
Anton!

43:09.916 --> 43:12.333
You made it out. You're all right!

43:12.416 --> 43:14.250
I told you it was her at the market.

43:15.833 --> 43:16.666
Hey.

43:17.250 --> 43:19.125
-What are you doing?

43:19.833 --> 43:21.083
Hey, stop that!

43:21.166 --> 43:22.791
Anton. Please, stop it!

43:22.875 --> 43:25.250
You don't give the orders anymore,
Princess.

43:25.333 --> 43:27.875
Rumor is Nilfgaard's looking for you.

43:29.166 --> 43:31.375
And willing to pay a barrel of orens, too.

43:32.083 --> 43:33.625
I'm sorry for what happened.

43:35.333 --> 43:37.125
I'm sorry if your family got hurt.

43:39.875 --> 43:41.625
We played knucklebones together.

43:42.291 --> 43:44.041
This isn't you. I know it.

43:45.416 --> 43:46.458
You know fuck all.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.541
You thought you were better than us
because we had to let you win?

43:51.000 --> 43:54.500
The only thing special about you
was the fucking crown on your head.

43:55.833 --> 43:56.708
No!

43:57.333 --> 43:59.083
No!

43:59.791 --> 44:00.791
I--

44:16.375 --> 44:18.083
<i>Verily, I say unto you</i>

44:18.166 --> 44:21.000
<i>the era of the sword and the ax is nigh,</i>

44:21.083 --> 44:22.916
<i>the era of the Wolf's Blizzard.</i>

44:23.375 --> 44:26.708
<i>The Time of the White Chill</i>
<i>and the White Light is nigh...</i>

44:27.708 --> 44:30.750
<i>...the Time of Madness</i>
<i>and the Time of Contempt.</i>
