WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:03.921
("Turkey in the Straw" plays
nearby)

00:03.921 --> 00:05.964
Ice cream.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.424
Ice cream, Mom-- can I?

00:07.424 --> 00:10.260
Sure.
Ice cream!

00:10.260 --> 00:12.095
Don't you need money?

00:12.095 --> 00:13.305
I need money!

00:14.973 --> 00:16.808
Thank you.
Don't run!

00:16.808 --> 00:17.809
Okay!

00:17.809 --> 00:18.977
(exhales)

00:18.977 --> 00:20.520
Shelly, you want ice cream?

00:20.520 --> 00:21.772
MISSY:
Ice cream!

00:21.772 --> 00:23.690
All right.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.859
Here you go.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.027
And no runnin'.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.946
In these loafers? Not a chance.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.572
I was jokin'.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.824
Okay.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.118
ADULT SHELDON:
It was turning out to be

00:35.118 --> 00:36.537
the perfect Saturday.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.039
The ice cream man
had extra napkins.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.374
I had tons of homework.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.335
And I was about to enjoy
an orange sherbet Push-Up,

00:43.335 --> 00:45.462
which was the only
kind of Push-Up

00:45.462 --> 00:47.047
I could actually finish.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.132
Then it all came crashing down.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.218
(crash)

00:51.218 --> 00:52.469
(ice cream splats)

00:52.469 --> 00:54.137
There's no telling
who could buy that house!

00:54.137 --> 00:55.639
What if they have dogs?

00:55.639 --> 00:56.974
What if they have birds?

00:56.974 --> 00:58.475
What if they have both
and the birds

00:58.475 --> 01:00.018
learned to bark like dogs?

01:00.018 --> 01:02.062
Sheldon, you're gettin' yourself
all worked up.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.439
For good reason-- that house is
six feet away from my bedroom

01:04.439 --> 01:07.067
window-- who knows what kind
of smells could jump the gap?

01:07.067 --> 01:11.071
Uh, cigarette smoke,
a scented candle, a durian?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.364
What's a durian?

01:12.364 --> 01:14.866
A vile-smelling fruit
of the genus Durio.

01:14.866 --> 01:15.993
When did you smell that?

01:15.993 --> 01:18.578
I haven't, and I'd like
to keep it that way.

01:18.578 --> 01:19.913
It might be nice.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.249
It might be a family
with kids your age.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.168
I already live with a kid
my age-- not a fan!

01:46.857 --> 01:48.191
What's up?

01:48.191 --> 01:50.694
Can I talk to you about
serious woman stuff?

01:50.694 --> 01:52.154
Of course.

01:52.154 --> 01:55.073
Is this a...
iced tea conversation

01:55.073 --> 01:57.409
or a hot tea conversation?

01:57.409 --> 01:59.703
Definitely hot.

01:59.703 --> 02:02.414
Uh-oh.

02:02.414 --> 02:03.874
So what's goin' on?

02:03.874 --> 02:05.208
(sighs)

02:05.208 --> 02:07.419
I think I have a boyfriend.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.463
Wow.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.797
But you cannot tell Mom.

02:10.797 --> 02:14.134
Oh, of course-- I love not
telling your mother stuff.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.553
So what-what-what's his name?

02:16.553 --> 02:19.014
Marcus Adam Larson,
he's 11 and a half,

02:19.014 --> 02:21.224
he has blond hair,
his favorite color's green

02:21.224 --> 02:22.684
and he's learning
how to skateboard,

02:22.684 --> 02:24.144
but he's not very good yet.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.730
Okay, well,
I have to ask, now...

02:26.730 --> 02:29.149
at your age, having a boyfriend,
what does that mean?

02:29.149 --> 02:32.652
Do you, uh... go out on dates?

02:32.652 --> 02:33.945
No.

02:33.945 --> 02:37.449
Um... well, d-do you hold hands?

02:37.449 --> 02:39.409
I wish, but no.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.662
So how do you know
he's your boyfriend?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.164
Because this happened.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.253
Wow.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.923
I didn't realize
you had documentation.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.175
I know.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.857
Something suspicious
is happening next door.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.192
Like what?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.236
Groups of strangers
keep coming and going.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.446
They must be using
the house to sell drugs.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.449
No one's selling drugs, they're
just havin' an open house.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.659
What's that?

03:20.659 --> 03:22.619
They open up the house
so people interested

03:22.619 --> 03:23.912
in buyin' it can take a look.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.082
That explains why 911
hung up on me.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.339
ADULT SHELDON: I had no choice
but to determine

03:34.339 --> 03:36.258
if any of these
prospective home buyers

03:36.258 --> 03:38.009
would be suitable neighbors.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.637
This shifty fellow?

03:40.637 --> 03:41.805
He looks like trouble.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.098
That woman and

03:43.098 --> 03:45.392
whatever dark secret is hiding
in her bag?

03:45.392 --> 03:47.227
Probably a machete.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.939
Oh, this lady seems promising.

03:50.939 --> 03:54.568
(faint crying)

03:54.568 --> 03:57.404
(baby crying)

03:57.404 --> 03:59.322
Not on my watch.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.407
MAN:
Please look around.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.992
If you have any questions,
I'll be right here.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.660
Excuse me, is there someone
in charge here?

04:03.660 --> 04:05.078
That would be me.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.371
Mr. Lundy?

04:06.371 --> 04:07.831
What are you doing here?

04:07.831 --> 04:10.167
I'm the realtor.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.335
But you're a teacher
and an actor.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.172
And while those both
pay so well,

04:15.172 --> 04:18.049
I like to do this
on the weekends for fun.

04:18.049 --> 04:20.051
(chuckles)
Why are you here?

04:20.051 --> 04:21.261
I live next door
and I'm concerned

04:21.261 --> 04:22.679
about who the new neighbor
might be.

04:22.679 --> 04:26.349
Don't you worry, I will
personally make sure that

04:26.349 --> 04:29.978
your new neighbor is whoever
forks over the most money.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.021
Thank you.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.063
Wait.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.274
So if you want to
be his girlfriend

04:34.274 --> 04:37.194
and he wants to be
your boyfriend,

04:37.194 --> 04:38.653
what's the problem?

04:38.653 --> 04:41.865
He also plays baseball,
and this weekend...

04:41.865 --> 04:44.409
I have to pitch against him.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.119
Yeah, so?

04:46.119 --> 04:49.414
So if I strike him out, he might
get mad and break up with me.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.416
Well, why would he do that?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.210
I've struck out a bunch of boys.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.544
They all get real mad.

04:54.544 --> 04:58.048
You're gonna pitch bad
to him on purpose?

04:58.048 --> 05:00.008
I was thinkin' about it.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.635
That is not
what you are gonna do.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.346
You are gonna do your best,
and if you strike him out,

05:04.346 --> 05:06.056
he will respect you for it.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.390
I don't know.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.518
When I struck out Brian Morgan,
he cried.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.270
Now everyone calls him
Cryin' Brian.
(chuckles)

05:12.270 --> 05:13.605
That's pretty funny.

05:13.605 --> 05:14.898
Thanks, I started it.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.149
(doorbell rings)

05:18.485 --> 05:20.111
Mr. Lundy?

05:20.111 --> 05:21.238
Come in.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.448
What brings you here?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.116
I'm the listing agent
on the house next door.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.660
But I thought you were
a teacher and a--

05:26.660 --> 05:28.703
And an actor, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.873
You've got to get your son
out of my open house.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.458
Why, what's he doin'?

05:33.458 --> 05:34.793
Well...

05:34.793 --> 05:37.045
♪ This is my house... ♪

05:37.045 --> 05:38.255
I noticed there's
hair on your coat.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.090

05:40.090 --> 05:41.341

05:57.941 --> 05:59.442
Thank you.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.113
Kind of a dump.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.406
But I could sell it.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.574
♪ Get out, hey. ♪

06:12.330 --> 06:14.249
Why are you reading
about property code?

06:14.249 --> 06:16.042
The house next door
to mine is for sale,

06:16.042 --> 06:18.837
and I'm looking for ways
to control who moves in there.

06:18.837 --> 06:22.465
When my family moved to Texas,
they burned our fishing boat.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.676
Tam, we're talking about
my problems right now.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.428
We usually are.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.305
Ooh, listen to this:
"A seller

06:28.305 --> 06:30.307
"or seller's agent
must disclose if a homicide

06:30.307 --> 06:31.808
has occurred on the property."

06:31.808 --> 06:33.310
Why is that helpful?

06:33.310 --> 06:35.312
That could scare off
any unwanted buyers.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.439
Has there ever been
a murder next door?

06:37.439 --> 06:39.316
I sure hope so.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.985
Hello, Officer Robin.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.361
This is Sheldon Cooper.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.487
What's wrong, Sheldon?

06:44.487 --> 06:46.114
I was wondering
if anyone was murdered

06:46.114 --> 06:47.907
in the house next door to mine.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.160
You mean murdered today?

06:50.160 --> 06:52.370
No, ever, but today
would work, too.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.081
It'll take me a while to check.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.541
That's fine, I can hold.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.877
Tell Mr. Givens I may be
a little late to class.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.712
It's a police matter.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.921
Sheldon's gonna be late.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.089
Well, all right!

07:03.089 --> 07:05.842
It's a police ma--
Don't care.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.177
Yes, I'm still here.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.428
Sorry, no murders.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.181
Just one death from
natural causes in

07:11.181 --> 07:12.515
1948.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.434
How can we be sure
it wasn't foul play?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.394
The man was 96 years old,
Sheldon.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.813
That's a lot of years
to make enemies.

07:18.813 --> 07:19.939
Bye.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.858
(line clicks, dial tone sounds)

07:21.858 --> 07:24.444
MEEMAW:
So,

07:24.444 --> 07:26.112
you playin' the
Tigers on Saturday?

07:26.112 --> 07:28.365
Should be an easy win.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.825
Their best player's parents
are getting a divorce.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.494
He's pretty distracted.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.371
Well, there's
a lucky break.

07:34.371 --> 07:37.707
I just hope it drags
out through playoffs.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.043
So how you feel about

07:40.043 --> 07:42.253
not pitchin' Missy?

07:42.253 --> 07:43.963
Why would I do that?

07:43.963 --> 07:46.716
Well, she's growin' up

07:46.716 --> 07:49.636
and she's going through
some new stuff...

07:49.636 --> 07:51.721
Oh, I don't want
to hear about that.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.847
No, no, no, she's--

07:52.847 --> 07:55.392
she's got a crush on a
boy on the other team,

07:55.392 --> 07:58.520
and she's worried that
if she strikes him out,

07:58.520 --> 08:00.146
that it will embarrass him.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.065
Well, that's too bad,
she's our pitcher.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.566
She's gonna do her job.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.820
Well, she's also an 11-year-old
girl with big feelings.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.281
And I'm a cranky old man
with no feelings.

08:12.117 --> 08:15.537
Well, I've always thought that
underneath that tough exterior,

08:15.537 --> 08:19.416
there was a shred
of compassion.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.753
Yeah, I know what
you're doing.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.422
What am I doing?

08:25.422 --> 08:28.591
You're using your feminine
wiles to get your way.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.926
Mm-mm-mm.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.720
Smart and handsome.

08:32.762 --> 08:35.598
You forgot tall.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.183
Don't say that.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.437
Never... say that.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.565
Goonies...

08:43.565 --> 08:47.402
never say die.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.613
Well done.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.866
Very moving.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.868
And speaking of moving,

08:54.868 --> 08:57.662
if any of your parents are in
the market for a two-bedroom,

08:57.662 --> 09:00.582
two-bath ranch-style
with a updated kitchen,

09:00.582 --> 09:03.209
have them give me a call.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.462
(school bell rings)

09:05.462 --> 09:06.671
All right, very good.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.716
How about next week we try some
monologues from actual theater?

09:09.716 --> 09:11.301
Just a thought.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.761
Mr. Lundy.

09:12.761 --> 09:13.845
Oh, what now?

09:13.845 --> 09:15.597
What happened with
the open house

09:15.597 --> 09:18.016
after you had me kicked out?
Were there any potential buyers?

09:18.016 --> 09:19.726
And if so, can I have
their names so I can run

09:19.726 --> 09:21.978
a background check
with my friends in blue?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.939
(chuckles) Sheldon,
if you think you're gonna

09:24.939 --> 09:29.068
stop me from selling
this house, you're wrong.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.695
Oh, am I?

09:30.695 --> 09:33.156
They tried to stop me
from staging The Crucible

09:33.156 --> 09:35.617
on roller skates.

09:35.617 --> 09:39.329
A lot of understudies
went on that day...

09:39.329 --> 09:42.499
but so did the show.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.085
You do not want me as an enemy.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.005
Or as a friend, sibling
or student, I've been told.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.507
All right, look,
if it's so important to you,

09:50.507 --> 09:51.925
why don't you just go out

09:51.925 --> 09:54.302
and find a buyer
that you'd be happy with?

09:54.302 --> 09:57.013
So if I find someone
I deem acceptable,

09:57.013 --> 09:59.099
you'd sell them the house?

09:59.099 --> 10:02.018
If the bank approves,
so do I.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.020
Excellent.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.272
I wonder if Stephen
Hawking would like Texas.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.732
It's very flat.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.360
Oh, I can't afford a house,

10:10.360 --> 10:12.570
but I'm flattered
you'd want me next door.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.531
Of course I would.
You don't have enough friends

10:14.531 --> 10:15.532
to throw a party.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.035
Yeah, well...

10:19.035 --> 10:21.412
Neither-neither do you!

10:21.412 --> 10:24.457
(chuckles): So, you think after
seeing you every day at school,

10:24.457 --> 10:27.252
I'd want to go home,
look out my window

10:27.252 --> 10:30.088
and see-see more of you?

10:30.088 --> 10:33.675
Yes.
Hey, maybe we could ride
to school together.

10:33.675 --> 10:34.801
We could play car games.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.303
(laughing):
Stop, you're killing me.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.348
I'm sorry, why would I want
to live next door to you?

10:40.348 --> 10:41.474
Ask Mr. Givens.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.477
Apparently, I'm hilarious.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.104
That's sweet of
you for asking,

10:46.104 --> 10:47.313
but I'd rather

10:47.313 --> 10:49.649
stick my finger in
a pencil sharpener

10:49.649 --> 10:51.359
and crank away.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.529
I would love to, Sheldon,

10:54.529 --> 10:55.822
but there's a district rule

10:55.822 --> 10:58.741
that says a principal can't
live next door to a student.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.493
That makes sense.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.662
Does it? Good.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.251
Hey. Robin says the house

11:08.251 --> 11:09.627
next door to y'all is for sale.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.337
Oh, yeah, it is.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.839
Is it nice?

11:12.839 --> 11:15.592
Uh... nice enough.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.802
Why? Are you thinking
about moving?

11:17.802 --> 11:20.597
I wasn't, but Robin's not
crazy about living in a house

11:20.597 --> 11:22.098
I shared with my ex-wife.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.725
That's understandable.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.643
I want her to be happy.
'Cause I love her.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.687
Not just 'cause she's a
cop with a gun. (chuckles)

11:27.687 --> 11:29.856
But that's part of it.
Well,

11:29.856 --> 11:32.775
I'm sure there are lots
of wonderful houses out there.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.777
I'd be happy to help you look.

11:34.777 --> 11:38.114
Do you not want us to look
at the one next to you?

11:38.114 --> 11:39.866
Oh, no, of course not.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.452
You should absolutely
look at it.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.495
As well as other houses.

11:44.495 --> 11:48.041
I have to say, this isn't
the reaction I was expecting.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.377
No, it is the reaction
you were expecting.

11:51.377 --> 11:55.798
(chuckles): Excited that my boss
might live next door to me.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.508
Yay!

11:57.508 --> 11:59.802
Well, my boss
lives everywhere,

11:59.802 --> 12:02.388
and you don't see me
getting weird about it.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.481
And then after you buy
the house, you rent it out

12:11.481 --> 12:12.690
to people who are
preapproved by me.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.651
I can't afford a second house.
Georgie,

12:14.651 --> 12:16.819
you make as much money as Dad.
Why don't you buy it?

12:16.819 --> 12:18.780
He does not make as
much money as me.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.865
No. But I don't have
to spend mine

12:20.865 --> 12:23.034
on stupid stuff
like food and kids.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.494
Mary, where's dinner?

12:24.494 --> 12:26.663
So, is that a yes
to buying the house?

12:26.663 --> 12:29.332
Sorry. When I move out,
it ain't gonna be 20 feet away,

12:29.332 --> 12:31.167
and it's got
to have a hot tub.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.418
MARY:
Sheldon, you need

12:32.418 --> 12:33.878
to stop involving
yourself in this.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.838
You upset Mr. Lundy,

12:35.838 --> 12:37.799
and you were rude to the
people at the open house.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.551
And he was bugging his
teachers at school all day.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.095
But Mr. Lundy said
I could help him.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.596
I don't care.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.349
Even Pastor Jeff is talking
about buying that house now.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.684
That could work out.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.103
His wife's a police officer,
so built-in security.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.522
And whenever I have
a theological zinger,

12:52.522 --> 12:53.982
I can call it right
over the fence.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.567
You want your boss
living next door?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.069
Not exactly.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.696
You don't have to worry

12:59.696 --> 13:01.322
about your boss. There's
a district rule that says

13:01.322 --> 13:03.783
that Principal Petersen
cannot live next door to me.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.160
That sounds made-up.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.870
A principal who tells lies.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.872
What are we gonna do
with this one?

13:15.795 --> 13:17.130
Here's the payroll checks.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.840
Thank you.
If you need
anything else,

13:18.840 --> 13:21.843
I'll be in my office,
which is next door.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.637
Sorry it's so close.
(sighs)

13:26.681 --> 13:28.975
Lord, I am trying my best.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.561
Please help me
with this situation.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.813
Amen.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.069
I meant fix him, not me.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.197
SHELDON:
Excuse me,

13:43.197 --> 13:45.908
Mr. Lundy. I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.410
Oh. What's going on?

13:47.410 --> 13:51.497
My mother has forbidden me
from helping you sell the house.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.876
That...

13:54.876 --> 13:57.962
is beyond bad news.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.882
I don't think I
can do this alone.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.425
I'm sorry. It's not me.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.094
No, I know it's not.

14:06.304 --> 14:09.557
Just enjoyed being in
the trenches with you.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.850
As did I.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.394
All right, Sheldon, I...

14:13.394 --> 14:15.897
I guess I'll see
you in the halls.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.774
Again, I'm sorry.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.818
Me, too.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.200
And scene.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.885
Hey, uh, Cooper,

14:45.885 --> 14:48.137
you know, I think I'm gonna
have you sit this one out

14:48.137 --> 14:49.555
and let Powell pitch.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.933
Really?
Yeah.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.602
Kind of like to save your arm
for the playoffs, okay?

14:54.602 --> 14:56.437
Okay.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.439
Do you want to save my arm, too?

14:58.439 --> 14:59.690
No.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.067
How about my legs?

15:01.067 --> 15:04.612
You know, Billy, you never fail
to brighten my day.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.280
Cool.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.616
Pastor Jeff, you got a second?

15:08.616 --> 15:10.910
Of course.

15:10.910 --> 15:11.994
I might've called
before dropping in,

15:11.994 --> 15:14.247
but that's just how
I was raised.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.918
I owe you an apology.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.170
I was worried about us

15:21.170 --> 15:22.213
working together

15:22.213 --> 15:24.841
and then living
next door to each other,

15:24.841 --> 15:28.845
but I like you
and Robin very much,

15:28.845 --> 15:31.055
and if you want
to look into that house,

15:31.055 --> 15:34.851
we would be lucky
to have you as neighbors.

15:35.852 --> 15:38.855
Thank you. That's nice to hear.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.148
I mean it.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.066
Good, 'cause Robin already
looked at it, loved it,

15:42.066 --> 15:44.694
put up police tape so no one
else could get in. (chuckling)

15:46.487 --> 15:48.281
Okay.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.241
Ball four.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.826
Oh, damn it.
(cheering and applause)

16:00.042 --> 16:02.003
We're gonna lose.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.379
Oh, we're gonna be fine.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.881
Powell's got this.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.425
I'll strike Marcus out.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.051
Put me in.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.180
Time!

16:12.180 --> 16:13.764
Time!

16:13.764 --> 16:15.808
I thought Marcus
was your boyfriend.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.185
Meemaw told you?

16:17.185 --> 16:20.104
She's my girlfriend.
You know, we talk about stuff.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.900
So, all that about saving my arm
for playoffs wasn't true?

16:23.900 --> 16:25.109
I was just being nice.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.652
Since when are you nice?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.070
Well, don't get used to it.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.239
Just go strike out
your boyfriend.

16:31.574 --> 16:32.742
Player change!

16:32.742 --> 16:34.702
(claps)
Come on, Cooper.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.330
Good job.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.123
Kind of.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.675
Strike one!

16:49.675 --> 16:51.552
Yes! Two more, Coop!

16:51.552 --> 16:52.970
Two more! Come on.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.389
I thought
we were saving her arm.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.100
Not now, Billy.
Okay.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.315
(cheering
and indistinct shouting)

17:04.315 --> 17:05.942
(groaning)

17:05.942 --> 17:06.943
Foul ball!

17:06.943 --> 17:07.944
Yeah, okay!

17:07.944 --> 17:09.153
You got this!
(sighs)

17:09.153 --> 17:10.696
UMPIRE:
Strike two.
DALE: Hang in there!

17:10.696 --> 17:12.615
No coddle. Come on, Coop.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.867
Bear down.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.964
Strike three!
Yeah!

17:27.964 --> 17:29.423
UMPIRE: You're out!
That's my girl!

17:29.423 --> 17:31.050
Yeah!

17:37.848 --> 17:38.975
Good job!
Way to go!

17:38.975 --> 17:40.977

and indistinct chatter)
