11:24.880 --> 11:26.350
OH, MY.

11:26.410 --> 11:28.780
LET ME
WIPE OFF THE DROOL.

11:28.850 --> 11:31.560
MARGE, GETTING OLD IS A
TERRIBLE THING.

11:31.620 --> 11:33.690
THE SADDEST DAY OF MY LIFE

11:33.760 --> 11:36.460
WAS WHEN I REALIZED I COULD
BEAT MY DAD AT MOST THINGS.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.920
BART EXPERIENCED THAT
AT THE AGE OF FOUR.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.500
SO, WHY ARE YOU
STILL AWAKE?

11:41.560 --> 11:44.690
I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S BOTHERING LISA.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.100
I DON'T KNOW.

11:46.170 --> 11:49.070
BART'S SUCH A HANDFUL,
AND MAGGIE NEEDS ATTENTION

11:49.140 --> 11:52.080
BUT OUR LITTLE LISA'S
BECOMING A YOUNG WOMAN.

11:52.140 --> 11:53.580
OH, SO THAT'S IT.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.380
THIS IS SOME KIND
OF UNDERWEAR THING.

11:56.440 --> 11:59.210
GOOD NIGHT, HOMER.

OKAY, LISA, <i>ALTISSIMOREGISTER.</i>

12:18.370 --> 12:20.440
VERY NICE, VERY NICE.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.010
I ONCE RUPTURED MYSELF
DOING THAT.

12:23.070 --> 12:24.440

NAME LIKE THAT?

12:28.810 --> 12:32.020
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY:
YOU EVER BEEN TO THE DENTIST?

12:32.080 --> 12:32.720
YEAH.

12:32.780 --> 12:33.420
NOT ME.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.350
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD GO

12:35.420 --> 12:38.020
BUT I GOT ENOUGH
PAIN IN MY LIFE
AS IT IS.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.990
I HAVE PROBLEMS, TOO.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.360
I CAN'T HELP YOU, KID.

12:41.420 --> 12:44.750
I'M JUST A TERRIFIC HORN PLAYER
WITH TONS OF SOUL

12:44.830 --> 12:46.700
BUT I CAN JAM WITH YOU.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.100

YOU'RE BEING NICE ENOUGH
TO YOUR SISTER, BART?

AND HAPPINESS WILL FOLLOW.
