It looks like a club to me,
Jarvis.

Yeah. Yeah, we're brothers.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.749
That's right, just different
moms.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.417
And dads.

It's a $600 and it comes with a
bottle of vodka.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.992
Hey a...I know we said we'd be
in for drinks tonight,

03:12.025 --> 03:13.927
but would you mind going in on
it just this one time?

03:13.961 --> 03:15.763
Get away from me, man.

Tall glass of water right there.

Hey hey, is that Naomi?

03:22.303 --> 03:23.437

03:23.471 --> 03:25.072
Oh that's embarrassing.

Hey, Omar.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.455
With his grandfather of course.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.656

03:42.690 --> 03:43.757
[collectively]
No!

03:43.791 --> 03:44.958
-We're not...
- Hell, no.
No.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.093
I'm Naomi Johnson.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.628
Damn, you too?

03:47.661 --> 03:49.663
Listen, we only got one table
left.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.131
I mean that is general
admission.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.301
- Hey just put it on my company
card.
- Or put it on a real card.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.135
- Hold on, hold on, hold on...I
don't know what the hell

03:55.168 --> 03:56.637
game y'all playin' out here,

03:56.670 --> 03:59.507
but I'm not fittin' to play it
all witchu. This is how we gonna
decide it.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.509
Pick a number between 1 and 10,
closest

04:01.542 --> 04:02.610
gets the table.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.712
I'm, I'm a pro at this. [clears
throat]

04:06.747 --> 04:07.981
One.

04:08.015 --> 04:11.485
- Five.
- Seven. Ladies, get your ID's
together. Let's go.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.820
So close.

04:12.853 --> 04:13.987
Have a good night, y'all.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.623
Come on in here.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.057
Bro, you picked one?

04:17.090 --> 04:19.293
- I saw it on Price is Right,
alright.
- Where do you even watch it?

04:19.327 --> 04:21.161
- I'm, it's right after
- Oh okay, guys...

04:21.194 --> 04:22.330
what are we gonna do now?

04:22.363 --> 04:23.631
[sigh]

04:23.664 --> 04:28.101
Hey, I got the perfect place,
and they serve food and drinks.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.038
Let's go.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.806
Are there bad women there?

04:32.840 --> 04:34.808
- Yes!
- Okay.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.209
[blows. lips flutter]

04:42.215 --> 04:44.017
Is that good?

04:44.217 --> 04:46.587
Leave me alone, Jarvis. I
haven't eaten all day, alright.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.390
- Well...glad you're enjoying
yourself.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.191
Listen fellas, I know y'all mean
well...

04:51.224 --> 04:53.861
but me partyin' with Naomi would
have been a disaster.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.397
Yeah, they probably bored out of
their minds right now.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.766
- It's a Tuesday, can't be that
lit in there, right?

04:58.799 --> 05:03.236
Mm, seems like they might be
having a slightly better time
than we are.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.411
- Oah.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.912
It looks forced to me.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.113
Yeah, it's definitely forced.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.116
Look, I'm just saying it really
looks like they're--

05:16.484 --> 05:18.919
yep, stuntin' for the gram.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.755
The bigger question is why you
still followin' Naomi?

05:22.423 --> 05:23.757
[gulp]

05:24.492 --> 05:26.594
Oh, were we supposed to
un-follow her?

05:26.627 --> 05:29.597
- Yeah.
- As long as you're not likin'
her pictures.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.832
No more liking her pictures.

05:33.901 --> 05:37.104
Today doesn't count though,
right? Cause it's already bro,
it's late

05:37.137 --> 05:39.306
and she put a recipe up.

05:39.940 --> 05:40.974
[sighs]

05:41.008 --> 05:42.976
- Communist.
- Are you policing?

05:44.111 --> 05:45.546
- Let me see.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.248
- Lisa and Serena...

yes, there is a strange man in
my kitchen.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.460
- [smirks]
- He stole my parkin' spot.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.327
* So you should confide in me

06:34.361 --> 06:37.030
He's putting sugar on the grits.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.799
Good to see you too.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.368
I know you've been workin' all
night tryin' to save the world,

06:41.401 --> 06:43.370
so I figured the least I could
do

06:43.403 --> 06:45.038
is make you some breakfast.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.207
Well...thank you.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.275
Mm hm.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.711
Yep, no sugar better not have
touched my grits.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.746
Oh you don't want no sugar?

06:53.313 --> 06:55.549
Maybe a little.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.655
Bon appetite.

Pancakes not crispy enough for
you?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.408
I can put 'em back in the
skillet.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.945
No! A...they're perfect.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.680
[fork scraping plate]

07:28.716 --> 07:32.753
So...I see you finally used the
key I gave you.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.454
- Yeah, yeah I um...

07:34.955 --> 07:37.457
I finally got somebody to rent
out my apartment on Airbnb.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.261
Figured I'd spend some time with
my lady while I make some money.

07:41.294 --> 07:45.398
So...I'm more of a convenience
for you.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.200
Don't do that.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.670
You the one who said we should
spend some more time together.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.605
Yeah but not like this.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.106
Ah okay.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.543
I am thoroughly confused.

07:55.576 --> 07:58.011
You come and go as you please.

07:58.045 --> 08:02.282
You use my address for cheaper
insurance on that gas guzzler
you drive.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.284
You drink all my orange juice.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.220
I cut your grass every week. I
change the oil on your car.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.223
- I fix--
- That's not the point, Gregory.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.593
You don't live here.

08:13.426 --> 08:16.163
It's like you have one foot in
and one foot out.

08:17.230 --> 08:21.268
* Just wanna get down sometimes.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.736
[chair scrapes]
* Get down

08:22.770 --> 08:25.138
* Get down sometimes

08:25.773 --> 08:27.407
[Greg exhales]

08:30.343 --> 08:32.312
We talked about this.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.015
I thought we were in a good
place.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.984
We are.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.019
We're buildin'. We're growin'.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.289
I just don't wanna rush things.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.958
I know people who've been dating
for 6 months

08:44.992 --> 08:46.960
and they've already move in
together.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.730
We're going on a year

08:49.763 --> 08:52.165
and you won't even leave your
toothbrush here.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.134
- Now that's because I walk in
on my ex

08:54.167 --> 08:56.670
usin' my toothbrush to lay down
here baby hairs.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.071
I'm traumatized by that.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.340
How else are we supposed to lay
them down?

09:00.841 --> 09:02.843
You, you don't be usin' my
toothbrush for your--

09:02.876 --> 09:06.614
You know, I just worked a
12-hour shift and I'm tired.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.681
Don't play like that.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.482
I'm gonna take a shower and get
some rest.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.384
- Don't play.
- Thank you for breakfast.

09:13.453 --> 09:17.625
[rhythmic R&B music]

09:20.961 --> 09:23.463
Sorry to keep you waiting, Omar.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.133
The line at Starbucks was
wrapped around the corner.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.202
Hey look, no worries...just
don't charge me for it, alright.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.673
[laughter]
Oh you already know you gettin'
the homie discount.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.275
Oh forgive me, I should've asked
you if you wanted somethin'.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.878
Ah no, I can't do it. Coffee
gives me headaches.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.380
- Headaches? Oh no, how do you
function without it?
- Yeah.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.149
Oh we have some bourbon in the
back.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.618
Well you know, I'm more of a
tequila kind of guy.

09:44.652 --> 09:47.354
- Really? I never knew that
about you.
- Yeah.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.222
In college you only drank the
dark stuff.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.625
Yeah well, anything is possible.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.226
Straight outta Henny.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.394
[laughter]

09:54.427 --> 09:56.229
Listen, I've mellowed out a
little bit since college.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.265
I hope so.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.001
So, you have somethin' for me

10:01.034 --> 10:04.537
Yes. As you know, she filed on
Friday.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.073
- Yeah.
