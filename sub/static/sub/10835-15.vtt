WEBVTT

00:01.794 --> 00:03.170
Previously on 90210...

00:03.295 --> 00:05.297
I'm the guy that hit you.
It was totally my fault.

00:05.422 --> 00:07.424
You know, the important thing
is that we're both all right.

00:07.549 --> 00:10.010
Navid, I'm not really
asking you for anything.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.762
Good, 'cause I-I don't know
if I can do anything

00:11.887 --> 00:14.264
or be anything to you.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.224
I reserved a hotel suite;
I'll be staying there

00:16.350 --> 00:17.434
until Mom comes home.
Hey, everyone.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.687
I have something to announce:
I'm pregnant.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.104
CHRISTINA:
Hey, Nika.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.648
I'd like you to meet Navid.

00:22.773 --> 00:23.607
Hi. What's up?

00:23.732 --> 00:25.108
This being in love stuff

00:25.233 --> 00:26.568
is making me crazy.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.111
You love me?
I do.

00:29.237 --> 00:30.364
What is this about?

00:30.489 --> 00:32.281
I'm just trying to
get to know you.

00:32.406 --> 00:33.408
The accident,
it changed things.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.577
I mean, I feel like
it woke me up or something,

00:35.703 --> 00:37.078
like it jolted me
out of my bubble.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.915
The bubble that I'm still in.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.339

00:47.464 --> 00:48.757

Have a nice day.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.819
Mm.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.279
Fashion section?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.280
Always.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.407
Your car is
waiting, Ms. Clark.

01:13.532 --> 01:14.491
Thank you.

01:25.586 --> 01:29.172
Hope you're not
disappointed, Naomi.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.466
How do you know my name?

01:31.592 --> 01:34.135
Oh, Robert told me
to expect you.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.765
Although...
I wasn't expecting you.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.311
Vanilla skim latte.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.230
Extra foam.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.481
NIC:
Don't walk away from me

01:46.607 --> 01:48.233
when I'm
talking to you!

01:48.358 --> 01:50.151
Hey! I am
talking to you.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.280
I said I want
a bloody scotch.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.281
I'm sorry, sir.

01:54.406 --> 01:55.657
The bar doesn't open
until 10:00.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.701
NIC:
Do you know
who I am?!

01:57.826 --> 01:58.994
Let me tell you
this slow, right,

01:59.119 --> 02:01.329
so you can understand
my English.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.124
Get me a scotch!

02:04.249 --> 02:07.294
Or I'll call INS and get
you shipped back to Mexico

02:07.419 --> 02:08.586
faster than you can say
"burrito." How's that?

02:08.711 --> 02:10.380
Excuse me.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.381
Small problem.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.841
What?

02:12.967 --> 02:13.884
Well, just that it'd be odd

02:14.009 --> 02:15.510
if you tried to send Miguel here

02:15.636 --> 02:17.512
back to Mexico
since he's from Guatemala.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.098
Unless you meant
send him on a vacation,

02:19.222 --> 02:20.849
which would actually
be a nice thing to do,

02:20.975 --> 02:22.643
considering
he works hard

02:22.768 --> 02:25.353
and has to deal with drunks
like you all day.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.355
(chuckles softly)

02:27.481 --> 02:28.899
You looking for
an ass kicking, Sunshine?

02:29.024 --> 02:30.567
No, not particularly.

02:32.611 --> 02:33.612
What the hell
are you doing?

02:33.737 --> 02:35.363
What--

02:35.489 --> 02:37.240
Get off!
Do you know who I am?!

02:37.365 --> 02:39.200
Hey! What-what
are you--

02:39.326 --> 02:40.201
Get off me!

02:40.327 --> 02:41.495
Hey!

02:51.630 --> 02:52.464
Hey, babe.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.799
Hey!

02:53.924 --> 02:55.592
You weren't supposed
to see that.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.552
Oh, all right, I...
I didn't see it.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.054
But good choice
on the red rose.

02:59.178 --> 03:00.639
It definitely
brings out my eyes.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.641
And I love your eyes.

03:02.766 --> 03:03.851
I love you.

03:03.976 --> 03:04.935
I love you, too.

03:05.060 --> 03:05.936
I love hearing that.

03:06.061 --> 03:06.937
I love saying it.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.605
I love being in it.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.940
I mean, it's like
everything is different now.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.151
I feel different now.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.528
Oh, this morning on the radio,
they played Whitney Houston.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.864
First time I ever heard her
and she didn't sound like

03:16.989 --> 03:18.615
some big sappy goober
I wanted to strangle.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.491
(both chuckle)

03:19.616 --> 03:20.450
Oh, yeah?

03:20.575 --> 03:21.535
Yeah.

03:21.660 --> 03:22.828
Because...

03:22.953 --> 03:25.914
I will always love you.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.751
Always.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.421
Always love you.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.631
Ooh-ooh-ooh.

03:34.756 --> 03:35.883
(both laugh)

03:36.008 --> 03:36.925
Well, you know,
you're being

03:37.051 --> 03:38.635
a big cheesy goober
right now, too.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.679
Yeah, well, I'm your
big cheesy goober, okay?

03:40.804 --> 03:41.555
All right, so...

03:41.680 --> 03:43.431
What?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.350
So you're still not gonna
tell me anything about

03:45.475 --> 03:47.477
our mysterious
Valentine's plans, huh?

03:47.602 --> 03:49.188
If I tell you,
it won't be mysterious.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.689
Oh, all right, Whitney,
do your thing.

03:50.814 --> 03:51.690
Do your thing.
Uh-huh.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.859
So, uh, I could pick
you up around 8:00

03:53.984 --> 03:55.986
if you want to just grab
dinner before the dance.

03:56.111 --> 03:56.987
I can't.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.279
I actually, uh, got into

03:58.405 --> 03:59.698
the acting intensive
that I signed up for.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.325
So I'll be there until 9:00,
if you want to pick me up then.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.493
Sure.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.370
Uh, you didn't
tell me you got in.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.663
Why not?

04:06.788 --> 04:08.331
Yeah, um, well,
it's just,

04:08.456 --> 04:10.500
it's kind of hard
to talk to you about acting

04:10.625 --> 04:13.336
without you thinking that
acting's all I talk about.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.630
Um, I said that I'm
sorry about that.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.882
Yeah, I know.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.466
But you think it's trite,

04:18.591 --> 04:20.468
and so it's kind of
difficult for me to...

04:20.594 --> 04:22.345
Hey, hang on one
minute, okay?

04:22.470 --> 04:24.014
Yeah.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.473
Sure.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.892
Hey.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.351
What's their deal anyway?

04:28.476 --> 04:29.770
You know, they-they talk

04:29.895 --> 04:32.106
about deep things.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.608
But I swear, if I had to hear
about how the accident

04:34.733 --> 04:35.984
changed everything
one more time,

04:36.110 --> 04:38.528
I may actually drive
into a tree myself.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.697
Okay. Well, you just let me know
before you do that,

04:40.822 --> 04:41.740
so I'm not in the car.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.033
(both chuckle)

04:43.158 --> 04:46.620
I just want her
to get better already.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.496
Maybe then, he won't have to
hang out with her so much.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.331
Hey, Rhonda.
Morning.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.333
Hey.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.334
How are you feeling?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.962
A little achy,
but okay.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.797
Sorry you couldn't come to the
documentary with us last night.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.966
Oh, yeah, I had play practice.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.425
But, uh, was it any good?

05:00.550 --> 05:01.551
Amazing.

05:01.676 --> 05:02.928
It was all just about how

05:03.053 --> 05:04.387
one moment can
change things forever.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.722
RHONDA:
Which is so true.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.558
I mean, the accident
profoundly changed me.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.644
(chuckles)

05:10.769 --> 05:11.770
Ethan, too.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.148
I mean, he used to
like action movies,

05:14.273 --> 05:16.191
but now he likes documentaries.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.820
Yeah, I-I think she means
changes on the inside.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.489
Yeah, I know.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.907
I-I was just kidding.

05:24.032 --> 05:24.908
Jeez.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.994
Uh...

05:28.829 --> 05:30.914
All right, well,

05:31.039 --> 05:32.082
we should go to class.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.750
Yeah. I'll see you guys later.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.378
Yeah, mm-hmm.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.337
See ya.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.926
Okay, maybe you should
drive into a tree.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.929
(theme music playing)

06:06.074 --> 06:07.617
It was probably
some dude in rehab.

06:07.742 --> 06:08.702
Bet Navid knows.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.078
Huh? What's up?

06:10.204 --> 06:11.579
Oh, yeah, Navid knows
everything. What's up?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.581
So who's Adrianna's
baby daddy?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.750
Oh, yeah,
I don't even know that.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.376
Could be anyone.
I have no idea.

06:19.671 --> 06:20.964
Man, you dodged a bullet, huh?

06:21.089 --> 06:22.216
Oh, yeah, totally, man.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.884
I mean, Adrianna's a mess.
I don't even know

06:24.009 --> 06:25.260
what I was thinking,
seriously.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.761
I mean, she has
her own thing going on.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.846
I'm not even
gonna worry about...

06:27.971 --> 06:30.724
Yeah, me neither.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.943
(chuckles)

06:42.069 --> 06:42.903
No "B."
(school bell ringing)

06:43.028 --> 06:44.863
Time for roses.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.490
Okay, so Megan.

06:47.615 --> 06:48.867
And here's one

06:48.992 --> 06:49.993
for you, Michael.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.620
Nika, here you go.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.081
Another one
for Megan.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.083
Joanna.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.500
One for Maya.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.419
And Adrianna.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.594
NAOMI:
Oh, honey.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.804
I'm getting pity flowers
from the faculty.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.431
I mean, I thought
they only did that

07:11.556 --> 07:13.225
with the 12th grader
in the full body cast.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.852
Scoliosis girl? I think
she has a boyfriend now.

07:15.977 --> 07:16.937
Of course she does.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.939
Hey, are you okay?

07:19.064 --> 07:22.650
I guess for a second I thought
it might be something romantic.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.069
I don't know why.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.988
I mean, obviously,
I'm not anybody's idea

07:27.114 --> 07:28.073
of a great Valentine's date.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.534
I mean, look at me.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.828
Hey. Hey!

07:33.954 --> 07:35.830
For the record,
you look great.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.833
You have super boobage
going on, crazy thick hair,

07:38.959 --> 07:40.877
the dewy, glowy look that's
all the rage on the runway,

07:41.002 --> 07:42.212
you've got it.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.964
If I were going to
the island of Lesbos,

07:44.089 --> 07:45.090
you'd be my pick.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.300
(chuckles)
Thank you.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.802
Ethan.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.053
Oh, my gosh.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.639
You waited?

07:52.764 --> 07:54.682
I was going over my essay
with Mr. Matthews for

07:54.808 --> 07:56.226
at least a half an hour.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.644
It's lunch; aren't you starving?

07:57.769 --> 07:59.687
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are a few hunger pains

07:59.813 --> 08:00.814
compared to
what you're going through?

08:03.108 --> 08:04.192
Which is all
because of me.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.986
So let's face it, I owe you.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.195
Right? But
let's go before

08:07.321 --> 08:09.197
they run out of pizza
and we get stuck with

08:09.323 --> 08:10.698
that brown stuff
they pass off as meat loaf.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.866
Ethan, wait.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.786
Um...

08:14.911 --> 08:15.996
there's something
I have to tell you.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.747
I-I just don't know

08:17.872 --> 08:19.249
how to tell you
without coming off

08:19.374 --> 08:20.708
like some kind of crazy woman.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.793
Which-which I'm not.

08:21.918 --> 08:22.836
I-I swear.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.963
What is it?

08:25.088 --> 08:27.882
Um... I'm...

08:28.008 --> 08:29.884
feeling better than
I've been letting on.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.886
A lot better.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.056
I've been exaggerating
my injuries.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.640
I can carry my own bag.

08:36.765 --> 08:37.683
What?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.602
I really liked
spending time with you,

08:40.727 --> 08:42.397
and I just thought
that if I was better,

08:42.563 --> 08:43.940
that you wouldn't
want to hang out anymore.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.942
It-it doesn't matter.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.988
I'm sorry
I took advantage of you.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.698
You're officially off the hook.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.952
What hook?

08:56.077 --> 08:57.037
We're friends.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.955
Just because of
some car accident...

08:59.080 --> 09:00.207
Who cares how we met?

09:00.332 --> 09:01.624
The point is, we did.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.418
And being in
the accident

09:03.543 --> 09:04.919
affected us both,
and we get each other.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.587
More than that,

09:06.713 --> 09:07.922
we like each other.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.632
At least, that's
what I thought.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.092
I don't know,
maybe-maybe you're getting

09:11.218 --> 09:12.886
sick of me
or something.
No.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.595
I-I'm not.
Okay.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.930
Good.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.641
But we have to be honest
with each other from now on.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.643
'Cause life's too short
for dishonesty.

09:20.768 --> 09:23.397
I completely agree.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.982
ANNIE:
I wonder where Ethan is.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.901
Probably off discovering
the meaning of life.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.278
(chuckles)

09:30.404 --> 09:32.697
All right, you got to help me.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.075
I have to plan this unique

09:35.200 --> 09:36.784
Valentine's plan.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.537
I told you,
just go to the dance.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.621
No. Everybody's gonna
go to the dance.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.916
Okay, um...

09:43.041 --> 09:46.086
take Dixon on some romantic
Valentine's dinner.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.212
The boy loves food.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.130
Yeah, but hasn't he been on

09:49.256 --> 09:50.715
a romantic
Valentine's dinner before?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.050
Yeah, but not in L.A.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.385
And-and trust me,

09:53.510 --> 09:54.719
the scene here is way different

09:54.844 --> 09:56.054
than the all-you-can-eat

09:56.179 --> 09:58.139
hot wings place in Kansas.
(both laugh)

09:58.265 --> 09:59.599
I'm gonna get another drink.
You want one?
Uh-uh.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.937
Ahem. Excuse you!

10:04.062 --> 10:05.021
Excuse you!

10:06.981 --> 10:07.941
Okay,

10:08.066 --> 10:08.983
I have something

10:09.109 --> 10:10.485
that's gonna help
you feel better.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.779
Tell me it's
the portobello quiche
I dreamt about last night.

10:12.904 --> 10:13.780
Voilà.

10:13.905 --> 10:14.906
Enjoy.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.325
This almost helps stall
the Valentine pain.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.744
You know, I've eaten
at the most amazing places

10:19.869 --> 10:21.204
in the world,
and nothing comes close

10:21.329 --> 10:22.914
to the restaurant at my hotel.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.416
I guess that's why there's,
like, a billion celebraties

10:24.541 --> 10:25.666
swarming there
all the time.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.043
Oh, my God, you should see

10:27.168 --> 10:28.169
the Valentine's Day menu
they have.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.170
Yeah?

10:29.296 --> 10:30.922
It's beyond.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.382
Lucky you.

10:32.507 --> 10:33.967
Of course,
I don't have a date

10:34.092 --> 10:36.303
to go with
to the restaurant.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.769
And why, almost before
we've even begun to live,

10:44.894 --> 10:48.356
become dull and gray
and apathetic

10:48.482 --> 10:51.901
and lazy and useless
and unhappy.

10:52.026 --> 10:55.905
Unhappy because I am nothing.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.449
(sighs)

11:01.119 --> 11:01.995
Excellent.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.538
(applause)

11:03.663 --> 11:05.248
And that's what
I'm talking about.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.249
That is it. That's it.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.335
(sighs)

11:08.460 --> 11:09.836
Okay, who's next?

11:11.463 --> 11:13.047
Um, all right, how about you?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.300
Yeah.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.262
Hi. Um, I'm Annie Wilson.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.056
And I will be doing
Fantine's monologue

11:22.182 --> 11:23.266
from Les Miserable.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.352
Ah, good monologue.
Desperate monologue.

11:25.477 --> 11:29.063
A lot of pain and anguish
in the class tonight.

11:29.189 --> 11:33.776
Monsieur Javert,
I-I-I beseech your mercy.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.530
I assure you that I had done
nothing wrong.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.282
If you had been there to see it
in the beginning,

11:39.407 --> 11:41.242
then you would have seen...
No, no. Stop.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.621
Um, Annie,
this, this woman is desperate.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.081
Honey, you got to delve
into your soul.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.959
You gotta, you gotta reach
into your own desperation.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.002
Bring that out, okay?

11:51.127 --> 11:52.962
Yeah.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.964
Okay.

11:58.134 --> 12:01.221
And I swear by the good of God
that I'm not to blame.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.305
Go deeper.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.640
That, that gentleman,

12:03.764 --> 12:07.227
the bourgeois
whom I did not know,

12:07.352 --> 12:08.478
put snow in my back!

12:08.603 --> 12:09.812
Annie, that's just louder.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.398
Has anyone the right...?

12:11.523 --> 12:12.482
You are about to lose

12:12.607 --> 12:13.941
everything.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.443
...to put snow down our backs,

12:15.569 --> 12:17.111
while we are walking along
peaceably...

12:17.237 --> 12:17.987
Where's your soul?

12:18.112 --> 12:18.988
To...

12:19.113 --> 12:20.574
Annie,

12:22.325 --> 12:23.618
Annie, come here.

12:23.742 --> 12:27.455
You are about to lose your
freedom and your child.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.208
Now, now, perhaps you've never
experienced something

12:30.333 --> 12:31.959
of that magnitude in your life,

12:32.085 --> 12:34.337
but surely there is
some painful memory

12:34.462 --> 12:36.297
that you can draw on,
some...

12:36.423 --> 12:38.174
you know?
Yes, yes.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.176
Then go there,
please.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.428
Take your time.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.513
Uh...

12:43.638 --> 12:46.933
(clears throat)

12:47.058 --> 12:50.395
I am rather ill, as you see,

12:50.520 --> 12:52.855
and he had said these

12:52.980 --> 12:55.066
impertinent things to me...

12:55.191 --> 12:56.067
O-Okay.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.821
That's enough.
That's enough.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.156
Thank you.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.159
Just, let's get some,
somebody else up there.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.036
You're fine.

13:32.604 --> 13:33.647
Thanks.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.233
Why are there sugar hearts

13:37.358 --> 13:38.443
in my waffle?

13:38.568 --> 13:40.445
I think, uh, Nat got
a little carried away

13:40.570 --> 13:42.280
with the Valentine's theme.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.239
Is everything okay?

13:43.364 --> 13:45.450
Sure, fine.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.993
Come on. What's wrong?

13:47.118 --> 13:49.454
Um, problems in the Middle East.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.038
Significant things like that.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.124
Annie...

13:53.249 --> 13:54.208
Look, it doesn't matter.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.043
I just want to put it
out of my head

13:56.169 --> 13:57.836
and enjoy Valentine's Day
with the boy that I love.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.841
And Rhonda?

14:05.261 --> 14:08.097
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
Uh, she, she's early.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.349
Early for what?

14:10.141 --> 14:11.058
Hey.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.059
Hey.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.443
Miss, as I told you over the
phone, we're completely booked.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.569
It's Valentine's Day.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.903
I know that.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.489
Which is why I really need
to get in.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.199
I want to take
my boyfriend out

14:26.324 --> 14:28.743
for a special dinner, and your
restaurant is the best.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.454
Which is why people make
reservations months in advance.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.247
Months ago, I didn't know
about Valentine's Day!

14:33.373 --> 14:35.208
No, I meant...

14:35.333 --> 14:37.168
Okay, I knew it existed...

14:37.293 --> 14:38.294
Look, I really wish
I could help you.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.548
Fine. I understand.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.132
Thank you for your patience.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.513
Take your ten dollars back,
please.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.514
Come on!

14:49.639 --> 14:51.057
(phone rings)

14:51.182 --> 14:53.059
Restaurant.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.477
Certainly. Tonight?

14:54.602 --> 14:56.563
And what time would
you like to dine?

14:56.688 --> 14:58.105
Uh, hello?
What's that about?

14:58.231 --> 15:00.441
Excuse me one second.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.069
We keep a small number of tables
reserved for hotel guests.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.779
Now if you'll excuse me.

15:06.489 --> 15:09.576
So, uh, what are you two crazy
kids gonna get up to

15:09.701 --> 15:12.746
while I'm off being tortured
by my new acting teacher?

15:12.871 --> 15:14.330
Um, probably just gonna go
shopping.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.416
For what?

15:16.541 --> 15:18.209
Clothes.
School supplies.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.421
(clears throat)

15:23.339 --> 15:24.758
I, uh...

15:24.883 --> 15:28.553
I asked Rhonda to, uh,
help me find you

15:28.678 --> 15:29.554
a Valentine's present.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.390
Trying to branch out

15:32.515 --> 15:33.349
from the stuffed
Pentapus thing.

15:33.474 --> 15:34.475
Oh.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.518
I feel very

15:35.643 --> 15:38.396
stupid.
(chuckles)

15:38.521 --> 15:40.481
I should get going pretty soon,
anyway, but I assume

15:40.607 --> 15:42.024
I'll see you
at the dance?

15:42.149 --> 15:43.693
Oh, I-I don't really do dances.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.069
How come?

15:45.194 --> 15:49.323
I just had a really bad
experience at one.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.491
What happened?

15:50.617 --> 15:51.409
Maybe she doesn't want

15:51.534 --> 15:52.410
to talk about it, Ethan.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.412
No, I do.

15:54.537 --> 15:55.663
I mean, I don't,

15:55.789 --> 15:57.373
but I should if we're being

15:57.498 --> 15:58.625
honest with each other, right?

15:59.751 --> 16:02.128
Okay, so,
at my old school

16:02.253 --> 16:03.379
there was a bunch
of girls,

16:03.504 --> 16:04.589
and I called them
"mean girls,"

16:04.714 --> 16:07.592
but they were so much worse
than that.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.009
It felt like
their sole purpose

16:09.135 --> 16:10.762
in life was just
to pick on me.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.722
Anyway, so there was this
end-of-the-year dance,

16:12.847 --> 16:14.474
and this guy Danny asked me out.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.476
And I was in shock.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.436
I mean, I had a huge crush
on him.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.438
So my mom and I
went shopping,

16:20.563 --> 16:23.650
and we found this dress,
and it was

16:23.775 --> 16:26.611
blue and gauzy
and it just,

16:26.736 --> 16:29.572
it reminded me of water,
of waves.

16:29.697 --> 16:30.740
And I went
to the dance

16:30.865 --> 16:32.158
and went looking
for Danny.

16:33.743 --> 16:37.288
And I found him standing
with those girls.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.291
And as soon as
they saw me,
they just...

16:40.416 --> 16:44.671
they all started to laugh.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.341
And one of the girls threw Danny
a hundred-dollar bill.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.636
Because apparently, the whole
thing was just a dare.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.554
I felt

16:53.680 --> 16:55.849
so humiliated.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.269
And so I took all
my mom's sleeping pills.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.229
Luckily,

17:02.355 --> 17:04.482
my mom found me
in time, and, um,

17:04.607 --> 17:08.361
and we moved here.

17:08.486 --> 17:12.866
I am so sorry, Rhonda.

17:12.991 --> 17:16.160
I've never told anybody
that story before.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.078
Well, I'm glad you told us.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.540
Yeah, I am, too.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.882
What...

17:29.883 --> 17:31.592
do you want?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.011
I need reservations downstairs
for dinner tonight

17:33.135 --> 17:34.637
and they are completely booked
unless you're a guest

17:34.762 --> 17:36.222
at the hotel, which I'm not,
you are,

17:36.347 --> 17:37.557
and I wouldn't ask except
it's Valentine's Day.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.434
Valentine's Day...

17:40.560 --> 17:43.938
a holiday you once referred to
as "the Greeting Card Mafia's

17:44.063 --> 17:45.732
stranglehold on the brainless
and sentimental."

17:45.857 --> 17:50.486
Well, I know, but look...

17:50.611 --> 17:52.112
I've never been in love before.

17:52.238 --> 17:56.034
You... in love?

17:56.158 --> 18:00.204
Yeah. And I want
tonight to be perfect.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.789
It has to be perfect.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.042
And I know that here
are no reasons for you

18:04.166 --> 18:06.460
to do any favors for me,
and we are not exactly friends

18:06.586 --> 18:07.712
or even frenemies
for that matter,

18:07.837 --> 18:09.255
but we were friends
at one point, and I...

18:09.380 --> 18:10.506
Look, when we were 12,

18:10.631 --> 18:12.592
I wrote a book report for you
on The Pearl

18:12.717 --> 18:15.302
and you said that you owed me
one, and I never collected,

18:15.428 --> 18:16.971
and I want to collect now.
Please?

18:22.685 --> 18:23.770
(clears throat)

18:25.479 --> 18:27.648
Larry, hi, darling,
it's Naomi.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.400
Can you do me a favor?
I have a friend

18:29.525 --> 18:31.861
who needs a reservation
for two tonight at 8:00.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.280
Oh, thank you.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.657
Ah! You're wonderful.
Bye now.

18:36.783 --> 18:40.954
Just make sure you preorder
the molten chocolate cake.

18:41.079 --> 18:41.996
They cook it
while you're eating.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.247
That's the best part
of the meal.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.999
Sounds good.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.294
Can I buy you a drink
or something to thank you?

18:51.547 --> 18:52.799
So we should sit
by the pool.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.676
There's a really nice view.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.764
Actually, it sometimes
gets chilly out there.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.724
Do you want to just
sit at the bar?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.810
Sure.

19:06.729 --> 19:07.897
I'll be right with you guys.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.356
Thanks.

19:10.566 --> 19:14.112
Well, the view isn't bad here
either, huh?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.739
Just don't mention
we're in high school.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.784
Oh, okay. I am on it.

19:19.909 --> 19:23.621
(mimics English accent):
So I said to my supervisor
at the airline,

19:23.746 --> 19:25.039
"Do not talk
to me like that again,

19:25.164 --> 19:27.500
or I will quit and take my
skills elsewhere, I will."

19:27.625 --> 19:30.003
Hey, Naomi.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.629
See, that's not fair.
You know my name,

19:31.754 --> 19:32.797
but I don't know yours.

19:32.922 --> 19:36.926
Leo. So what can I get you two?

19:37.051 --> 19:39.261
I'll have a
sparkling water.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.638
Trying to avoid
the hard stuff

19:40.763 --> 19:42.140
till I go back
over the pond.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.391
I'll just have a chamomile tea,
thanks.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.645
What was that?

19:47.770 --> 19:49.897
English accents always
make people sound older.
In what world?

19:50.023 --> 19:51.315
I can't stop now.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.692
Okay, but less is more.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.485
(English accent):
You got it, mate.
Seriously.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.904
Cheerio.
All right...

19:57.030 --> 19:58.781
one sparkling water,

19:58.906 --> 20:01.784
one chamomile tea.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.870
Thank you. And I do
appreciate that, I do.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.705
Sure thing. Honey?

20:05.830 --> 20:08.374
(chuckles)

20:08.499 --> 20:10.001
Well, you're awfully
forward, aren't you?

20:12.003 --> 20:13.420
For your tea.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.505
Honey?

20:14.630 --> 20:16.382
Oh, right.

20:16.507 --> 20:17.884
No thank you.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.928
So you're new here.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.389
Yeah, just moved to L.A.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.349
With your... girlfriend?

20:25.474 --> 20:27.060
Well, if I had a girl,

20:27.185 --> 20:28.728
I wouldn't be flirting
with your friend here.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.525
MAN:
Excuse me, sir.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.069
Can we get
another round?
I got to get back to work.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.240
(stifled giggle)

20:52.668 --> 20:54.545
Thanks.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.300
Hey.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.802
Hi.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.555
What are you, uh...

21:04.680 --> 21:06.306
Wow, what a coincidence.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.392
Yeah.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.936
Wait, uh, Adrianna,

21:10.061 --> 21:11.729
um, I just wanted

21:11.854 --> 21:14.857
to apologize for what happened
by the lockers yesterday.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.026
It's fine.
No, no, no,
it's not fine.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.861
I was a jerk
and I'm sorry.

21:18.986 --> 21:19.946
It's just, the guys
were talking

21:20.071 --> 21:21.948
and Nika was there, and...

21:22.073 --> 21:24.075
I didn't want
to make her feel bad.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.702
But I ended up making you
feel bad, which--

21:26.827 --> 21:30.289
which is the last thing
I wanted to do.

21:33.375 --> 21:37.004
Look, it's a weird situation
all around.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.631
Trust me,
I get it.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.133
Right.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.759
Well, the next time
anybody says

21:41.884 --> 21:42.802
anything, okay,

21:42.927 --> 21:45.138
I'm gonna...

21:45.263 --> 21:47.681
shut 'em down.
Navid-style, okay?

21:47.807 --> 21:50.601
Yeah, and what exactly
does that entail?
I don't know.

21:50.726 --> 21:51.852
I'll let you know
when I have that

21:51.978 --> 21:52.937
figured out.
Okay.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.063
Hopefully, I'll have it

21:54.188 --> 21:55.606
worked out by the dance tonight.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.985
Well, no rush-- I'm not going.

21:59.110 --> 22:02.029
Sorry to bring up the dance.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.447
Now everything's
even more awkward.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.949
No, it's, it's not.

22:05.074 --> 22:09.578
I'm really happy
you met someone else.

22:09.703 --> 22:10.955
I really am.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.456
You're such
a special guy.

22:12.581 --> 22:16.376
You deserve to have fun,
and to go to dances

22:16.502 --> 22:17.962
and just...

22:18.087 --> 22:21.174
just be normal.

22:23.092 --> 22:26.595
And normal is not really
where I'm at right now.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.475
Um, ooh, make sure
that you get Nika

22:31.600 --> 22:32.810
the butter crunch truffles,

22:32.935 --> 22:34.478
'cause there's really
nothing like them

22:34.603 --> 22:35.646
in the entire world.

22:35.771 --> 22:36.772
Truffles?
She'll love them.

22:36.897 --> 22:37.857
All right.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.650
Okay.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.695
Have fun eating your chocolate.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.488
Happy Valentine's Day.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.824
Yeah, you, too.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.421
I know, right?
That's what I thought.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.257
I mean, he's nice,
but it's not "wow,"

23:03.381 --> 23:05.509
and I'm really going for "wow,"
or anything better than "wow."

23:05.634 --> 23:07.803
Is there even a word
that's better than "wow"?

23:07.928 --> 23:08.679
Here, wear these.

23:08.804 --> 23:09.680
Really?

23:09.805 --> 23:10.806
Mm-hmm.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.683
Oh, come here!
Thank you!

23:12.808 --> 23:14.018
Okay, hugging me
over shoes--

23:14.143 --> 23:15.853
Seriously, what has gotten
into you, Silver?

23:15.978 --> 23:16.937
You're a completely
different person.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.231
It's the love, man.

23:18.356 --> 23:20.066
I'm telling you,
it changes things.

23:20.191 --> 23:23.401
It's like I see the world
as this whole better place.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.364
And, Naomi, I never thought
that I could feel like this.

23:26.488 --> 23:31.160
Well, I'm glad you found someone
who makes you this happy.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.996
Plus, it's been
kind of cool

23:34.121 --> 23:36.999
us hanging out again.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.251
It has, hasn't it?

23:38.376 --> 23:40.127
So, okay, what are
you going to do

23:40.253 --> 23:41.670
about hotty bartender?

23:41.795 --> 23:43.130
Oh...

23:43.256 --> 23:44.090
Oh, oh, okay, wait.

23:44.215 --> 23:45.883
You've got to ask him

23:46.008 --> 23:47.676
on a date tonight
for Valentine's Day.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.887
Well, it's not like I have
any other plans, but...

23:50.012 --> 23:51.347
Oh, well, no, his shift
just ended.

23:51.471 --> 23:52.890
I think he said
he was going home.

23:53.015 --> 23:54.141
What if you send
him a bottle

23:54.267 --> 23:55.559
of champagne
with a note

23:55.684 --> 23:58.229
telling him to meet you
by the pool?

24:00.273 --> 24:02.149
Not bad. I like it.

24:02.275 --> 24:04.860
Exciting! Exciting! Exciting!

24:07.905 --> 24:11.742
Front desk.
Larry. Hi, sugar,
it's me again.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.120
Listen, I need you to do me
a little unusual favor.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.330
Is there any way you can
have something delivered

24:16.454 --> 24:17.998
to one of your
employee's homes?

24:18.124 --> 24:19.625
(British accent):
Bloody brilliant.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.877
ROGER:
My dad was sitting
in his armchair

24:22.002 --> 24:24.004
drinking and yelling
at the TV.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.923
He loved game shows.

24:26.048 --> 24:28.134
And the guy on the TV
gets it wrong

24:28.259 --> 24:29.885
and my dad yells at the screen,

24:30.010 --> 24:31.595
"Even a moron would know that!"

24:31.720 --> 24:33.222
And I call out, I said,

24:33.347 --> 24:35.808
"Well, then you must be a moron
'cause you didn't know."

24:37.935 --> 24:39.186
So that's when my dad gets up

24:39.312 --> 24:41.397
out of his chair
and grabs me

24:41.521 --> 24:44.442
and he, um, he takes
his cigarette

24:44.566 --> 24:48.612
and he... grounds it out
right into my arm.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.907
So, when I need

24:52.032 --> 24:53.826
to know what pain feels like,

24:53.951 --> 24:55.493
I got a little reminder.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.123
Annie.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.000
Why don't you come up here.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.713
Tell us a story

25:06.839 --> 25:08.132
from your life.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.091
Something that matters.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.801
Okay.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.178
(clearing throat)

25:12.303 --> 25:16.474
Um, well, there was this
birthday thing that happened.

25:16.598 --> 25:20.227
This really awful girl-- Naomi,
went behind my back, and...

25:20.353 --> 25:21.603
Annie,

25:21.728 --> 25:24.231
go deeper.
Something really painful.

25:24.357 --> 25:25.983
Something that might

25:26.108 --> 25:27.651
be hard to say out loud.

25:27.776 --> 25:31.197
Okay. Deeper.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.908
(breathes deeply)

25:35.034 --> 25:37.077
Um, well...

25:37.203 --> 25:39.163
at my old school

25:39.288 --> 25:41.081
there were these girls.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.792
It felt like

25:43.917 --> 25:48.714
their sole purpose in life
was to make me miserable.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.924
Well, one day this guy Danny

25:51.050 --> 25:53.844
who I had a huge crush on,

25:53.969 --> 25:54.845
asked me to the dance.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.847
So, my mom and I
went shopping,

25:56.972 --> 25:59.725
and I bought this...
blue dress.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.102
And the way that it flowed
down to the floor...

26:02.228 --> 26:03.521
it was like water.

26:03.645 --> 26:04.897
I thought, you know,
that it was going

26:05.022 --> 26:06.148
to be the best day of my life.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.275
Only, when I got there,

26:08.401 --> 26:10.277
Danny was standing...

26:10.403 --> 26:12.279
with those girls,

26:12.405 --> 26:14.031
and as soon as they saw me,

26:14.156 --> 26:15.032
they started to laugh.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.200
One of he girls actually

26:16.325 --> 26:18.118
threw Danny
a hundred-dollar bill,

26:18.244 --> 26:18.869
because it was just

26:18.994 --> 26:21.163
a dare.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.164
Oh, God, I don't know

26:22.289 --> 26:23.290
what I was thinking,

26:23.416 --> 26:24.375
except that

26:24.500 --> 26:26.710
that I wanted to stop thinking.

26:26.835 --> 26:30.714
So... I took
these sleeping pills

26:30.839 --> 26:32.299
from my mom's
medicine cabinet,

26:32.425 --> 26:35.635
and I swallowed them-- all.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.055
'Cause I just wanted
the pain to end.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.478
Thank you.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.940
I knew you had it in you.

26:48.065 --> 26:49.733
Thank you.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.610
(laughing)

26:58.117 --> 26:59.993
Um...

27:00.119 --> 27:00.618
(chair clatters on floor)

27:02.121 --> 27:03.914
Ethan, Ethan, stop.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.416
Please!
Rhonda told us
that in confidence

27:05.541 --> 27:07.834
because she trusted us.
And I didn't say
that it was her.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.086
No kidding! You
said it was you!

27:09.211 --> 27:10.712
How could you use something
like that as material?

27:10.837 --> 27:13.215
I panicked. Okay, I panicked,

27:13.340 --> 27:14.383
because he said,
"Go deeper, go deeper,"

27:14.508 --> 27:15.509
And then I thought
of her story.

27:15.633 --> 27:17.344
It wasn't a story.
It's her life.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.972
I know.
You don't. Otherwise you
never would have done that.

27:21.515 --> 27:24.393
I can't-- I can't
even look at you.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.327
Wow!

27:41.452 --> 27:43.537
Yeah?

27:43.661 --> 27:46.832
I-I mean,
what's better than wow?

27:46.957 --> 27:48.917
I don't know, but there
needs to be a word.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.336
I was just thinking today

27:50.461 --> 27:52.087
how there should be a word.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.173
Come here.

27:57.510 --> 28:00.346
Told you I'd one-up
the high school dance.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.097
Yeah. This place
is pretty awesome.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.432
Oh, just wait till

28:03.557 --> 28:05.017
you see the food.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.186
Apparently, they have the best
chef in the whole city.

28:07.311 --> 28:10.688
Oh, and I ordered a special
dessert. You're gonna die.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.819
What?

28:15.944 --> 28:19.697
Just... wow.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.884
Can I get you
anything, Miss Clark?

28:39.009 --> 28:40.886
Oh, no, I'm all right.
Thank you.

28:41.011 --> 28:42.346
I'm actually meeting someone.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.014
Well, just let me
know if I can.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.475
Thank you.

28:49.228 --> 28:52.064
♪ Oh, oh ♪

28:52.189 --> 28:53.315

29:00.989 --> 29:03.283
I'm just saying, I've
never seen my parents

29:03.409 --> 29:05.160
gush over anyone like that.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.454
Well, it helps that
they go to the same
synagogue as my parents.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.415
Trust me, it was all you.

29:09.540 --> 29:10.957
It was all me-- yeah, right.

29:12.418 --> 29:13.544
Come on, let's dance.

29:19.049 --> 29:20.092
Mmm. Man, it's
going to be hard

29:20.217 --> 29:21.093
to stuff down
Mom's casseroles

29:21.218 --> 29:22.469
after a meal like that.

29:22.595 --> 29:25.556
Well, as long as you
saved room for dessert.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.807
And here is your menu.
Oh. Thanks.
I actually

29:27.933 --> 29:29.309
preordered that
molten chocolate cake.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.894
Oh. Okay.
Naomi...

29:31.019 --> 29:32.979
Naomi said it is
the best thing

29:33.105 --> 29:34.523
she's ever tried.
Um, miss,

29:34.648 --> 29:36.149
are-are you sure you ordered it?

29:36.275 --> 29:38.318
What? Yeah.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.361
I told the concierge.

29:39.486 --> 29:40.529
I'm so sorry.

29:40.654 --> 29:41.530
I don't have you down for one,

29:41.655 --> 29:43.115
and unfortunately,

29:43.240 --> 29:44.408
we're all out of them now.

29:44.533 --> 29:45.784
Okay, but I ordered it.

29:45.909 --> 29:48.078
I told him specifically that...
Baby, baby,

29:48.203 --> 29:49.413
it's cool--
we'll just get something else.

29:49.538 --> 29:50.830
No! I don't want something else.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.082
I want the chocolate cake.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.626
I'm terribly sorry.

29:53.751 --> 29:56.169
No, you don't have to be sorry,
just go get us the cake, please.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.547
Go get us the cake.
Um, can you just
give us a sec?

29:58.672 --> 30:00.424
Honey, uh,

30:00.549 --> 30:01.467
why are you getting so upset?

30:01.592 --> 30:02.884
Because I wanted this
to be perfect,

30:03.009 --> 30:03.969
and now it's
not gonna be perfect!

30:04.094 --> 30:06.054
(chuckles):
Silver... Silver,

30:06.179 --> 30:07.222
relax.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.599
Listen, us...

30:08.724 --> 30:11.143
being here together,
me and you,

30:11.268 --> 30:13.312
that's what makes
this perfect.

30:13.437 --> 30:16.231
All right? The cake,
it's just cake.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.317
All right?

30:18.442 --> 30:21.487
And besides, I didn't even
give you your gift yet.

30:31.121 --> 30:32.080
Go ahead, open it.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.166
(laughs)

30:37.127 --> 30:38.545
(exhales)

30:42.174 --> 30:44.092
You like it?

30:44.217 --> 30:45.969
Love it.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.889
I really love it.

30:59.149 --> 31:01.026
Let's get a room.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.570
What?

31:03.696 --> 31:06.573
I love you, and...
I want to be with you.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.576
So let's get a room.

31:09.702 --> 31:10.994
Here.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.120
Tonight.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.206
Can we?

31:17.250 --> 31:18.627
Yeah.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.504
Yeah.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.551
(loud rock music playing)

31:35.728 --> 31:36.645
Hey.

31:36.770 --> 31:37.646
Hey.

31:37.771 --> 31:39.648
Um, where's Annie?

31:39.773 --> 31:42.568
Don't know, don't care.

31:42.693 --> 31:44.194
I thought you
weren't coming.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.571
Oh, yeah.

31:45.696 --> 31:47.489
But after what happened today,

31:47.614 --> 31:49.241
after telling you guys,

31:49.366 --> 31:50.325
I just felt better.

31:50.450 --> 31:51.618
I don't know.

31:51.744 --> 31:53.537
Like maybe I could handle it.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.414
Well, I'm glad you're here.

31:55.539 --> 31:56.956
And you look beautiful.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.084
Thanks.

31:59.209 --> 32:00.794
(phone ringing)

32:02.796 --> 32:05.298
Uh, you want to dance?

32:05.424 --> 32:07.967
Definitely.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.721
Hey, this is Ethan.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.639
Leave a message after the tone.

32:12.765 --> 32:15.475
Ethan, please call me back.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.103
(crying):
Um, I know
what I did was wrong,

32:18.228 --> 32:20.230
and I'm ashamed of myself.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.691
So please, just forgive me.

32:37.706 --> 32:40.417
Um... are you sure
you're ready for this?

32:45.297 --> 32:48.425
I've never been more ready
for anything in my life.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.801
When you said you
were bad at dancing,
I totally thought

33:30.926 --> 33:33.720
you were just kidding.
Aw, come on, you were
just so jealous

33:33.846 --> 33:35.430
of my sweet, sweet
dance moves.

33:35.555 --> 33:38.057
Oh, so very jealous!

33:38.183 --> 33:39.309
Your chariot, madam.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.436
Thanks.

33:41.561 --> 33:44.272
I... I had a really good time.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.732
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

33:45.858 --> 33:48.652
It was just what I needed.

33:50.403 --> 33:51.697
So...

33:51.822 --> 33:53.406
good night?

33:53.532 --> 33:57.035
Yeah. Yeah.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.671
Uh, what?

34:07.796 --> 34:10.130
Uh... we-we're friends.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.634
Yeah, but I...
You know,

34:12.759 --> 34:13.719
I-I have a girlfriend.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.721
Who you broke up with.

34:15.846 --> 34:18.181
What? I never said that.

34:19.431 --> 34:20.766
You didn't need to.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.561
You danced with me
the whole night,

34:22.686 --> 34:24.062
you said I looked
beautiful,

34:24.187 --> 34:26.481
and now you're standing here
with me at the end of the dance.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.859
I-I was walking you to your car.

34:32.277 --> 34:34.989
But you looked at me like that.

34:35.114 --> 34:38.117
Rhonda, however you think
I was looking at you...

34:38.243 --> 34:39.494
You were.

34:39.619 --> 34:42.455
You told me
to be honest with you.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.416
Then be honest
with yourself.

34:44.541 --> 34:47.460
You were looking
at me like that.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.755
If I was...

34:49.880 --> 34:51.505
I'm sorry.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.427
Whatever.

34:55.552 --> 34:56.636
Rhonda, wait.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.096
I'm fine.
I just got to go home.

34:59.389 --> 35:01.099
(door closes)

35:05.353 --> 35:07.105
(knocking)

35:08.523 --> 35:10.108
Come in.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.323
What are you
doing here?

35:17.449 --> 35:19.492
Um, y-your mom let me in.

35:27.834 --> 35:30.003
You are such a mess, Ade.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.798
Okay, thanks for that.
You're a
recovering addict,

35:32.923 --> 35:34.215
you're pregnant,

35:34.340 --> 35:35.634
and you have
what I hope

35:35.759 --> 35:37.385
is chocolate smeared
all over your face.

35:37.510 --> 35:40.138
And you are
a total mess.

35:41.347 --> 35:43.141
And I couldn't care less.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.687
Want to know why?

35:47.813 --> 35:50.273
'Cause I was
at the dance tonight...

35:50.398 --> 35:54.027
and everything was
supposed to be perfect.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.363
But it wasn't
anywhere near perfect.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.782
Why?

35:58.907 --> 36:00.784
Because I wasn't with you.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.704
So I wanted

36:04.830 --> 36:06.247
to ask you something.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.335
Will you be my Valentine?

36:13.546 --> 36:14.881
Yeah.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.424
I will.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.564
Hold-hold on, I got to...

36:31.690 --> 36:34.985
Look, wait, uh, class starts...

36:35.110 --> 36:37.612
You-you know what?
You know what?

36:37.737 --> 36:40.323
Uh, let's... let's just
get detention for being late

36:40.448 --> 36:42.492
so we can keep doing
this after school.
Okay.

36:42.617 --> 36:43.368
Come here.

36:43.493 --> 36:44.410
(groans)

36:44.536 --> 36:46.287
You... you okay?

36:46.412 --> 36:47.622
Yeah.

36:47.747 --> 36:48.874
No.

36:48.999 --> 36:51.710
Um... I'm a little sore.

36:51.835 --> 36:52.961
Well, okay, I was...

36:53.086 --> 36:55.296
I was gonna wait
to show it to you,

36:55.421 --> 36:56.882
but... who cares!

37:03.972 --> 37:05.932
Uh, wow.
(laughs)

37:06.058 --> 37:07.934
(laughs):
That's...
Your name. I know.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.896
Don't you go changing it,
or I'm gonna be really upset.
Yeah, okay.

37:11.021 --> 37:12.939
Um, is it... is it real?

37:13.065 --> 37:13.732
Oh!

37:13.857 --> 37:14.983
Yes. I got it done

37:15.108 --> 37:16.818
on Sunday at this amazing

37:16.943 --> 37:19.320
tattoo parlor in Venice.

37:19.445 --> 37:20.113
Come here.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.700
I wanted to get
something permanent

37:23.825 --> 37:26.619
to symbolize our love.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.039
(bell rings)

37:30.957 --> 37:32.542
(exhales)

37:32.667 --> 37:34.669
♪ ♪

38:07.994 --> 38:12.207
Okay, so, who wants
to come up here
and solve for X?
(knocking)

38:12.331 --> 38:13.959
Sorry to interrupt--
I wanted to introduce you

38:14.084 --> 38:15.752
to a student that's
gonna be joining your class.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.170
Uh, come on in.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.881
All right, everybody,
this is Liam Court.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.716
Make him feel at home.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.802
Or at school.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.344
Anyway, carry on.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.805
Please,

38:26.930 --> 38:28.431
take a seat.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.560
Josie.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.604
Let's have
at this equation.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.569
You're in high school?

38:41.694 --> 38:42.528
Thanks to you.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.905
What?

38:44.030 --> 38:45.824
My mom had to sign
for that bottle

38:45.949 --> 38:47.951
of champagne you sent over,
with the little note

38:48.076 --> 38:49.577
about how I was
your favorite bartender.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.537
Which sort of
tipped her off

38:51.663 --> 38:53.206
that I wasn't enrolled here.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.833
Well, how was I
supposed to know?

38:54.958 --> 38:55.959
I thought you were older.

38:56.084 --> 38:59.337
Yeah? Well, right back at you.
