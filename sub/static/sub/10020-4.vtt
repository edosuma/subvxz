WEBVTT

00:04.293 --> 00:06.802
ER

00:06.903 --> 00:08.159
Previously on ER...

00:08.160 --> 00:10.554
But I'm confident
that you'll make things work.

00:10.555 --> 00:11.903
Thank you for your trust.

00:12.257 --> 00:16.299
My teacher told me I had talent,
but he was trying to get into my pants.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.173
So you trust me?

00:18.374 --> 00:19.954
This time.

00:19.955 --> 00:24.565
Deep penetrating, poorly visualized
cabinets. I think it should be off limits.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.122
We don't usually refer
to our senior surgeons that way.

00:27.223 --> 00:28.990
So I should stop speaking my mind?

00:29.191 --> 00:32.806
I don't think taxpayers are interested
in buying Doris a tox screen.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.274
You're out there working with us
and you got AIDS?

00:35.275 --> 00:37.282
I gotta get by like everybody else.

00:37.765 --> 00:38.901
"When The Bough Breaks"

00:38.902 --> 00:41.493
Hold on! Hold on!

00:42.580 --> 00:47.504
I got stuck on call today, so I gotta
drop this stuff off and then head back.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.888
I couldn't get anybody
to cover for me.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.308
I've already taken off so much time.

00:57.516 --> 01:00.187
I'll get you a key if you'll
be coming in this early.

01:00.354 --> 01:02.940
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.

01:03.149 --> 01:04.360
What is that?

01:04.568 --> 01:05.861
It's oxygen.

01:06.027 --> 01:09.575
Peter, this is getting morbid.
Do we really need all this stuff?

01:09.784 --> 01:11.786
Breathing monitor, devibullator-

01:11.995 --> 01:14.289
No, no, no. "Defibrillator. "

01:16.125 --> 01:19.046
They wouldn't be sending him home
if he was in any danger.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.883
Paramedics take six minutes
to respond to a call.

01:22.091 --> 01:25.262
If something happens,
you need to resuscitate. Come here.

01:25.471 --> 01:29.477
The mask attaches to the ambu-bag.
The ambu-bag to the tank.

01:29.685 --> 01:33.482
If he stops breathing, call 911
and make sure his airway is clear.

01:33.690 --> 01:37.571
Then turn the oxygen to 10 liters
per minute, and then bag him.

01:38.113 --> 01:42.202
One squeeze every three seconds.
Now, if you don't get a pulse-

01:42.410 --> 01:46.082
One hundred chest compressions
per minute. I know, I know.

01:46.249 --> 01:49.921
Well, good. If something happens,
you'll be glad you know.

01:50.754 --> 01:52.549
Go to work, Peter.

01:55.845 --> 01:56.930
All right.

01:59.391 --> 02:02.604
I'll meet you at the nursery at 10.
Is somebody picking you up?

02:02.771 --> 02:03.940
I'll call my mom.

02:04.106 --> 02:05.274
Okay.

02:06.317 --> 02:07.861
Don't forget about the car seat.

02:08.027 --> 02:09.572
Peter?

02:10.323 --> 02:11.699
It's gonna be all right.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.497
Yeah.

02:19.752 --> 02:22.588
How's it going, Doug?
Need some duct tape?

02:22.798 --> 02:24.592
That's what this is?
An ego check?

02:24.801 --> 02:27.221
No, this is about
spending time together.

02:27.386 --> 02:29.099
I can think of better activities.

02:29.265 --> 02:30.892
I like to keep you off balance.

02:31.059 --> 02:33.771
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Carol...

02:33.896 --> 02:36.233
- ... but you underestimate me.
- I don't think so.

02:36.399 --> 02:38.694
- It's like ice-skating.
- Until you have to stop.

02:38.860 --> 02:41.073
- That's what lampposts are for.
- Your helmet.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.407
Oh, no. No helmet.

02:42.574 --> 02:44.869
- Safety first.
- You're not wearing a helmet.

02:45.035 --> 02:47.206
- You'll mess the 'do!
- I know what I'm doing.

02:47.373 --> 02:49.334
You mean you wear that on purpose?

02:49.501 --> 02:52.504
- Skate, Tonya.
- All right, Mr. Crash.

02:52.713 --> 02:54.675
Crash? I'm not gonna...

02:57.678 --> 02:59.347
Mark, are you there?

03:02.476 --> 03:03.977
Mark?

03:05.271 --> 03:06.648
Who is it?

03:07.357 --> 03:09.486
It's me. Jen.

03:10.445 --> 03:12.155
Just a sec.

03:20.250 --> 03:23.171
- Is something wrong?
- No, I got it. Come on in.

03:26.717 --> 03:28.887
- You sleep in your clothes?
- No.

03:29.971 --> 03:33.267
- What's that?
- It's an infomercial thing.

03:34.477 --> 03:37.607
Sorry, I wasn't expecting visitors.
What's up?

03:38.149 --> 03:40.361
Rachel fell asleep in class Monday.

03:40.528 --> 03:43.698
She said her daddy kept her up
watching movies all weekend.

03:43.865 --> 03:46.118
You never went out.
You order pizza every night.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.455
You're telling me how to
spend time with her?

03:48.622 --> 03:50.039
It's getting to her.

03:50.249 --> 03:54.296
She's nervous, her stomach hurts
all the time. She's worried about you.

03:54.463 --> 03:58.217
- She is?
- I am! Look at this place, Mark.

03:58.426 --> 04:01.430
It's normal to be frightened
after something like that.

04:01.638 --> 04:04.476
Don't try to fix me, Jen.
It's not your job anymore.

04:04.643 --> 04:05.978
Want to sit down?

04:06.771 --> 04:08.272
Fine.

04:09.358 --> 04:11.194
I won't drop Rachel off this weekend.

04:11.777 --> 04:13.571
Don't expect to pick her up.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.907
You can't keep me from seeing
my daughter!

04:16.075 --> 04:19.245
You need some time to work this out,
until you're more yourself.

04:19.411 --> 04:21.457
Look, I am her father, okay?

04:21.666 --> 04:24.336
And she loves you.
But you're hurting her right now.

04:26.297 --> 04:28.425
I'm doing you a favor, Mark.

04:29.677 --> 04:32.681
Call me when you have
your life back together.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:28.360 --> 05:30.155
I feel happy.

05:30.490 --> 05:32.537
I feel healthy.

05:33.664 --> 05:35.878
- I feel terrific.
- I'm glad.

05:37.340 --> 05:39.888
Nice pep talk. Motivational tapes?

05:40.097 --> 05:42.185
Success is 99 percent attitude.

05:42.394 --> 05:44.608
Really? That makes me
a miserable failure.

05:44.859 --> 05:47.282
No, no. Failure is a state of mind.

05:47.490 --> 05:49.035
You didn't pay for that advice?

05:49.202 --> 05:53.714
I didn't get a great start this year,
and unless I change my approach...

05:53.881 --> 05:57.097
...I'm gonna hate all of my internship.
What are you doing?

05:57.264 --> 06:00.731
Symatic presentation.
Boring, but they had a great buffet.

06:00.940 --> 06:03.487
Free penlights.
I snagged you a couple.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.451
See? It's working already.

06:06.412 --> 06:09.127
- New pups are waiting outside.
- Excellent.

06:11.759 --> 06:13.304
- Good morning.
- Morning.

06:13.930 --> 06:15.392
Hi. John Carter.

06:15.601 --> 06:19.444
Welcome to what promises to be your
most exciting rotation. You are...?

06:19.652 --> 06:21.532
- James Sasic.
- Ivan Fu.

06:21.741 --> 06:23.287
Ivan, good to meet you. Jim.

06:23.454 --> 06:24.539
James.

06:24.791 --> 06:28.299
James, right. I assume you've
met Anna Del Amico.

06:28.508 --> 06:30.429
Great. Let's get started, shall we?

06:30.638 --> 06:33.812
Chuny, what you got for
a couple of eager new med students?

06:34.021 --> 06:35.817
A 4-F with abdominal pain in 3.

06:36.026 --> 06:38.783
-4-F?
- Female, fertile, fat and 40.

06:38.992 --> 06:40.245
Add flighty and flatulent.

06:40.454 --> 06:44.129
Always nice to start off with a round
of gallstones. Follow me!

06:44.297 --> 06:45.759
We call him Sergeant Sunshine.

06:45.926 --> 06:47.513
That's a nasty bump.

06:47.679 --> 06:50.269
- Lucky I have a hard head.
- Ouch. What happened?

06:50.479 --> 06:52.399
Sports accident.
He won't be specific.

06:52.609 --> 06:54.363
A testosterone injury?

06:54.531 --> 06:57.538
- He who laughs last, laughs hardest.
- I'll remember that.

06:57.746 --> 06:58.833
Mark, how you doing?

06:59.041 --> 07:03.719
Didn't you hear? I stay up late, don't go
out, order pizza, watch too much TV.

07:04.847 --> 07:07.311
- What is that?
- He's a little cranky, I guess.

07:07.562 --> 07:09.985
- What else is new?
- Turn it up.

07:11.154 --> 07:13.744
- Cops are chasing a motorcycle.
- Again?

07:13.953 --> 07:16.083
past the other traffic.

07:16.251 --> 07:19.425
- That's so stupid.
- At least he's wearing a helmet.

07:19.634 --> 07:21.054
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

07:21.221 --> 07:23.017
- I'd like to compliment you.
- On what?

07:23.184 --> 07:27.445
Your fellowship pediatric proposal
on pediatric PCA. Very intriguing.

07:27.653 --> 07:30.201
- Where'd you get that?
- Department of Pediatrics.

07:30.410 --> 07:34.713
Allowing children to control their own
pain medication is ahead of its time.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.300
Well, thank you.

07:36.508 --> 07:40.435
Of course, it has been three years.
It's a shame you never finished it.

07:40.643 --> 07:44.069
UC San Diego is actually
implementing the idea.

07:44.278 --> 07:45.990
- I didn't know that.
- Take a look.

07:46.241 --> 07:48.621
Unfortunately, they've proven
your original thesis.

07:48.788 --> 07:52.214
But you could use their data to
develop a smaller clinical study.

07:52.423 --> 07:54.218
Say, PCA in the Emergency Department.

07:54.428 --> 07:57.018
Clinical studies were never
really my strong suit.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.025
If you already have something
else, then go with it.

08:00.192 --> 08:03.868
I've outlined a research
and grant application schedule.

08:04.076 --> 08:06.958
I'd be happy to review any
material before submission.

08:07.251 --> 08:10.843
I appreciate it. I do.
But I can handle this on my own.

08:12.180 --> 08:15.062
If that were true, you would've
been done a long time ago.

08:15.271 --> 08:19.406
I'm serious, Doug. The ER cannot
continue to pay for a Pediatric Fellow.

08:19.615 --> 08:23.332
You need a research grant to cover
your salary before the end of the year...

08:23.500 --> 08:25.546
...or look for a private practice.

08:27.635 --> 08:28.762
What's this?

08:28.930 --> 08:31.102
This is my eviction notice.

08:32.981 --> 08:35.486
- So which student do you want?
- It doesn't matter.

08:35.655 --> 08:37.743
You got boned last time.
I'll give you dibs.

08:37.909 --> 08:40.039
No, you choose.
Either one is gonna be great.

08:40.207 --> 08:43.340
Be careful, doctor. Blind optimism
will screw you every time.

08:43.465 --> 08:44.635
Well, what have we got?

08:44.802 --> 08:47.266
A 41-year-old female,
low-grade fever...

08:47.517 --> 08:51.109
...anxious, complains of gas
and of right upper-quadrant pain.

08:51.318 --> 08:52.655
And what do you wanna do?

08:52.863 --> 08:57.625
Get a CBC and an ultrasound to confirm
thickening of the gallbladder wall...

08:57.834 --> 09:00.715
...and/or common bile-duct dilation.

09:01.217 --> 09:03.849
And what are the other two borders
of Calot's triangle?

09:04.935 --> 09:08.777
- Excuse me?
- The common duct and...?

09:08.987 --> 09:10.490
The cystic duct in the liver.

09:11.660 --> 09:12.704
Hooray.

09:12.912 --> 09:13.957
What have we got?

09:14.124 --> 09:17.591
Jeremy Willis, isolated right leg injury.
Nineteen, going on infinity.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.512
- Say again?
- He thinks he's an angel.

09:19.679 --> 09:21.183
Flew into traffic.

09:21.350 --> 09:24.024
- Can you feel this?
- He walked against the signal.

09:24.357 --> 09:25.694
Can you wiggle your toes?

09:25.903 --> 09:27.866
He can't see me, but I'm always there.

09:28.325 --> 09:29.912
Distal neural's intact.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.082
Bad hair day, huh?

09:31.959 --> 09:33.922
I'm trying to grow it out.

09:34.132 --> 09:35.760
Let's not humor him, huh, Lily?

09:36.095 --> 09:38.894
Let's get a right tib-fib
and a knee series.

09:39.102 --> 09:41.692
Looks like a fracture.
We'll have to get some x-rays.

09:41.901 --> 09:43.196
So much pain.

09:44.156 --> 09:47.414
We'll get you some morphine.
Titrate up to 10.

09:47.665 --> 09:51.049
And let's get a Psych consult.
Exam 1.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.304
Carla, over here!

09:54.432 --> 09:57.522
- I thought your mother was coming.
- She couldn't get off work.

09:57.773 --> 09:59.694
Relax, DaFina's just driving me home.

09:59.945 --> 10:01.282
Does she still smoke?

10:01.449 --> 10:02.493
Wait! Hold on.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.498
I got to get this. Okay. All right.

10:04.665 --> 10:05.834
Smile!

10:07.296 --> 10:08.675
That's great.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.766
Hey, Daddy!
You must be so excited.

10:11.933 --> 10:13.102
Yeah.

10:15.399 --> 10:16.736
Hold it, hold it.

10:17.906 --> 10:22.124
Listen, I get off at 7. I'll be
to your place no later than 8, okay?

10:22.376 --> 10:24.547
Don't you want to kiss him goodbye?

10:24.966 --> 10:26.134
Yes, I do.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.196
Peter? Is this your baby?

10:34.363 --> 10:35.366
Here, I got him.

10:35.951 --> 10:37.621
Yeah, he's being discharged today.

10:37.788 --> 10:39.501
- Ah, little-
- Easy! Easy!

10:39.709 --> 10:42.258
- Congratulations!
- Careful. Careful.

10:42.424 --> 10:45.558
You certainly are the secretive sort.
I had no idea.

10:46.268 --> 10:50.444
Dr. Corday is new here. Dr. Corday,
this is Carla. Carla, this is Dr. Corday.

10:50.653 --> 10:52.031
Don't you look fantastic.

10:52.241 --> 10:54.621
I had the baby in May.
He's been in the NICU.

10:54.872 --> 10:56.125
But he's all right now?

10:56.293 --> 10:59.091
- Yeah, yeah. He's fine.
- Good.

10:59.299 --> 11:01.263
Well, I'll see you upstairs.

11:01.471 --> 11:04.103
- Wonderful meeting you.
- Same here.

11:06.024 --> 11:07.319
All set.

11:07.528 --> 11:09.408
- You gotta go.
- Yeah, I know.

11:09.616 --> 11:11.329
Carla, I need to...

11:11.538 --> 11:13.919
- You gotta go.
- Yeah.

11:14.128 --> 11:16.341
- I'll see you later.
- Carla.

11:27.201 --> 11:30.335
- When did the asthma flare up?
- He's bad since last night.

11:30.585 --> 11:34.052
- And he's been using his puffer?
- Yes. How much longer for the doctor?

11:34.219 --> 11:35.723
I am the doctor, Mrs. Landeta.

11:35.848 --> 11:38.187
Could you sit back for me, sweetie?

11:38.480 --> 11:41.028
Okay, 2.5 mgs of albuterol.

11:42.030 --> 11:43.743
- Is that sore?
- A little.

11:44.953 --> 11:46.583
Has anyone taken a stool sample?

11:46.750 --> 11:49.215
Get Dr. Ross.
He always makes him feel better.

11:49.423 --> 11:51.762
- Dr. Ross isn't available right now.
- I saw him.

11:52.013 --> 11:53.600
Yes, but I'm your doctor today.

11:56.608 --> 11:59.197
- How's our fugitive doing?
- He got on the Eisenhower.

11:59.365 --> 12:01.285
- Big mistake.
- They have him now.

12:01.495 --> 12:04.961
Come on, people. We're backed up.
Watch it on the 5:00 news.

12:05.128 --> 12:07.133
- Dr. Ross?
- Yeah.

12:08.010 --> 12:10.642
- Come see my grandson. He's very sick.
- Where is he?

12:10.850 --> 12:11.895
Come, I take you.

12:12.062 --> 12:14.443
I ask this lady for you,
she don't let me see you.

12:14.610 --> 12:15.780
It's bad, huh?

12:15.988 --> 12:18.703
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Dr. Del Amico can handle it.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.293
You're gonna help him, huh?
You are?

12:21.502 --> 12:22.797
You can?

12:23.674 --> 12:25.846
No problemo.
Doctor, I'll take it from here.

12:27.350 --> 12:28.603
Sure. No problema.

12:30.399 --> 12:34.283
Acute asthma, peak flow's 90.
Some generalized abdominal tenderness.

12:34.450 --> 12:38.043
Okay, I got it. Jamie and I know the drill.
Right, champ?

12:38.210 --> 12:39.839
- Yeah.
- See you, kiddo.

12:40.132 --> 12:41.969
We'll warm this up.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.642
Al?

12:44.852 --> 12:46.188
What are you doing here?

12:46.397 --> 12:49.237
- I'm getting my stitches out.
- Now?

12:50.866 --> 12:53.832
I really didn't have
anything else to do.

12:55.168 --> 12:56.547
What happened?

12:58.050 --> 12:59.930
I showed up at the new site...

13:00.097 --> 13:03.397
...and the foreman said
there must have been a mix-up.

13:04.107 --> 13:06.195
Said he was maxed out.

13:06.780 --> 13:09.119
Didn't need any more guys.

13:09.746 --> 13:11.082
Al, I'm sorry.

13:13.004 --> 13:15.886
Hey, look, the guy's a jerk.
You'll find something else.

13:16.304 --> 13:17.432
Not in construction.

13:18.142 --> 13:21.817
Every contractor in Chicago
will hear that I have AIDS.

13:22.026 --> 13:24.992
Al, look, I know this is hard for you.

13:25.827 --> 13:29.502
It was hard for me. I work in medicine,
where people understand.

13:29.670 --> 13:30.964
But it gets better.

13:31.341 --> 13:34.181
No one wonders how you got it.

13:35.392 --> 13:37.439
I used to be one of those guys.

13:37.648 --> 13:40.530
We'd tell fag jokes.

13:42.368 --> 13:44.039
Believe me...

13:45.709 --> 13:47.798
...it won't get any better.

13:52.059 --> 13:54.063
You wanna pull the skin
a bit tighter.

13:54.231 --> 13:56.486
You don't want the vein
to roll on you.

13:56.611 --> 13:58.199
Great. You're ready to stick her.

13:58.366 --> 14:01.081
- This is gonna hurt, right?
- No. She's not gonna feel it.

14:01.248 --> 14:03.461
Carter, you paged me for a consult?

14:03.712 --> 14:05.926
Dr. Benton, meet Ivan Fu,
my new med student.

14:06.511 --> 14:08.808
I was Dr. Benton's medical student.

14:09.017 --> 14:12.149
- I'm proud to say I lived to tell the tale.
- Carter.

14:12.316 --> 14:14.781
Not here. Curtain Area 3.
Acute cholecystitis.

14:14.989 --> 14:18.498
Temp's up to 102, white count's
28,000. Positive Murphy's sign.

14:18.666 --> 14:20.629
- Ultrasound?
- Still waiting.

14:20.796 --> 14:21.924
But you paged me.

14:22.133 --> 14:25.516
It's been over an hour.
We both know what it'll look like.

14:25.683 --> 14:29.066
She needs an ultrasound to confirm
that she's a surgical candidate.

14:29.275 --> 14:31.698
I've seen enough cases.
I thought you'd want this-

14:31.865 --> 14:33.703
I've got three in-patient consults.

14:33.869 --> 14:36.000
You get an ultrasound, page me.

14:38.130 --> 14:40.803
- The labs are in, I got the history.
- Great.

14:41.013 --> 14:44.438
- Well, now what?
- Lunch. I'll see you in about a half-hour.

14:44.646 --> 14:46.651
- How'd you go out with that guy?
- What guy?

14:46.860 --> 14:48.363
Ross. Didn't you date him?

14:48.573 --> 14:51.580
If he's that patronizing to me,
I can't imagine dating him.

14:52.039 --> 14:54.796
He's seen that patient before.
She's comfortable with him.

14:54.963 --> 14:57.511
- Because he's a man.
- Some people are old-fashioned.

14:57.761 --> 15:01.228
- Doug has difficulty with strong women.
- I don't know about that.

15:01.438 --> 15:03.776
If he can't charm or vilify you,
he's lost.

15:03.902 --> 15:04.988
- That's not true.
- Lady!

15:05.155 --> 15:07.953
- I'll talk to him.
- No, it's okay. I will.

15:08.079 --> 15:09.499
I don't feel good.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.546
- What's the problem?
- I hurt.

15:11.713 --> 15:14.762
- Have you seen a triage nurse?
- The bitch never came back!

15:14.971 --> 15:17.101
- What's your name?
- Doris!

15:17.268 --> 15:19.523
Take a seat. I'll be with you
as soon as I can.

15:19.733 --> 15:21.612
I've been sitting over there!

15:21.821 --> 15:23.951
This is County on one alpha.
Go ahead.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.663
County, this is Rescue 56.

15:25.873 --> 15:29.131
We're on the scene of a multi-victim
accident. High-speed chase.

15:29.381 --> 15:31.846
Auto versus school bus.
How many can you handle?

15:32.055 --> 15:34.519
We can take three major,
10 minor. Over.

15:34.686 --> 15:35.813
Oh, my God!

15:35.981 --> 15:37.944
We haven't assessed the site...

15:38.320 --> 15:40.743
Connie, grab the Trauma rooms
and Curtain 2.

15:40.952 --> 15:44.502
Set up the rapid infusers with warm
saline. Mobilize the blood bank.

15:44.669 --> 15:47.092
Clear out all non-critical patients.
How many?

15:47.300 --> 15:49.640
- They don't know yet.
- Cynthia. Cynthia!

15:49.807 --> 15:53.983
Call the O.R. Tell them we have a mass
casualty alert. Has anyone seen Mark?

16:20.967 --> 16:23.765
Second unit's in. DPL positive.
Probable ruptured spleen.

16:23.974 --> 16:25.770
- Shall I take him?
- Anspaugh's coming.

16:25.937 --> 16:28.025
- Don't forget the films.
- X-rays! X-rays!

16:28.652 --> 16:30.490
- Come on! Clear!
- What happened?

16:30.699 --> 16:34.249
Cop chasing some guy, plowed into
a bus full of junior-high kids.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.797
- Who was that? Where's he going?
- I don't know.

16:37.006 --> 16:40.515
Has anyone seen Matthew?
He was showing Sal his gecko.

16:40.765 --> 16:42.520
I told him to leave it at home.

16:42.770 --> 16:44.357
Ma'am, sit down until someone-

16:44.567 --> 16:48.534
I am their teacher. I need to know
where every one of them is.

16:48.744 --> 16:50.122
I am accountable.

16:50.331 --> 16:52.712
- Do you have the parents' numbers?
- At the school.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.549
Maybe you should call and get them.

16:54.717 --> 16:56.972
I said three majors, you give us 10.

16:57.139 --> 16:58.184
Carol! Carol!

16:58.350 --> 17:00.689
- Make sure no none else comes.
- There's more?

17:00.899 --> 17:04.324
On our arrival, asystole.
Head, chest, abdominal trauma.

17:04.531 --> 17:06.997
Angulated tib-fib fracture.
Pupils sluggish.

17:07.247 --> 17:09.211
Couldn't get a line, so we intubated.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.759
- What happened?
- Ejected from the exit door.

17:11.967 --> 17:13.931
They should put seat belts
on the buses.

17:14.097 --> 17:16.060
Back up, Carter! Back up!

17:17.105 --> 17:18.776
He's stable. Let's go!

17:18.943 --> 17:20.112
How bad over there?

17:20.614 --> 17:23.746
I'm fine. Get this kid
behind me, he's bad.

17:23.954 --> 17:25.208
He's bad. Get him!

17:25.459 --> 17:28.383
Fourteen-year-old male.

17:32.769 --> 17:34.021
What happened?

17:34.231 --> 17:35.692
Can you tell me your name?

17:35.859 --> 17:38.324
- Brian.
- Can you open your eyes, Brian?

17:39.786 --> 17:40.872
Coming through!

17:41.081 --> 17:44.631
Near amputation above the left elbow,
hanging by a 2 cm skin bridge.

17:44.881 --> 17:47.639
BP's down, 70/30. Pulse is only 32.

17:47.889 --> 17:52.316
The estimated blood loss is 750 cc's.
We got 500 cc's saline in.

17:52.526 --> 17:54.113
- Grab the arm!
- I know, honey.

17:54.321 --> 17:57.204
Okay, on my count. One, two, three!

17:59.041 --> 18:02.926

cath her and dip a urine for blood.

18:03.176 --> 18:06.727

18:06.894 --> 18:09.316
Cap refill's poor.
Let's bolus a liter of saline.

18:09.526 --> 18:10.779
Hey! I need that!

18:12.909 --> 18:14.580
Get five liters of epi down.

18:14.873 --> 18:16.836
- Got the line in.
- It's going.

18:17.044 --> 18:20.344
Give it IV. Hang a unit
of O-neg on the rapid infuser.

18:20.595 --> 18:22.223
Oh, man.

18:23.059 --> 18:24.771
- A lizard.
- It's a gecko.

18:24.981 --> 18:26.735
Rachel wanted one.

18:26.943 --> 18:28.448
- Need a surgeon?
- He will...

18:28.614 --> 18:30.453
...if we bring him back.

Four-by-four and some saline.

18:42.398 --> 18:44.028
Ivan, A, B, C, D, E?

18:44.195 --> 18:46.575
Airway, breathing, circulation,
disability, expose.

18:46.743 --> 18:48.037
Can you tell me your name?

18:48.288 --> 18:51.671
- My arm is falling off!
- If she can talk, she has an airway.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.428
- Can we save it?
- We'll try.

18:54.803 --> 18:56.600
We have to get your arm on ice.

18:56.808 --> 18:59.523
- You're cutting my arm off!
- So we can reattach it.

18:59.733 --> 19:01.487
Pulse ox 98 percent on 10 liters.

19:01.696 --> 19:03.993
All right, come on! Move! Move!

19:04.202 --> 19:07.126
Here we go. Come here, sweetheart.
Just squeeze my hand.

19:07.335 --> 19:10.802
Squeeze my hand.
Squeeze. Good. Good.

19:11.386 --> 19:14.603
Call Neuro. Draw a trauma panel.

19:15.647 --> 19:19.072
Pupils are sluggish. Let's intubate
before we ship him to CT.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.870

19:22.080 --> 19:25.797

19:28.888 --> 19:31.227
Installing a satellite dish.
He fell off the roof.

19:31.394 --> 19:33.190
- Did he hit his head?
- I don't know.

19:33.399 --> 19:37.033
Versed's onboard. Take him
to Curtain 3. I'll be there soon.

19:37.242 --> 19:40.290

19:44.175 --> 19:45.805
- Get a blood gas.

- We won't get anywhere with a trauma.
- We're not getting anywhere with it now.

19:50.482 --> 19:51.987
He's a kid, Mark.

19:53.532 --> 19:54.952
- All right.
- Thoracotomy tray.

19:56.497 --> 19:58.294
- My x-rays?
- You medicate for pain?

19:58.544 --> 20:00.340
- She's had morphine.
- Not enough!

20:00.590 --> 20:03.807
- Crit's 28.
- Repeat. Page re-implantation team.

20:04.016 --> 20:06.731
Somebody call the O.R. and book a room.
Fu, move! Move!

20:06.940 --> 20:08.277
Carter, corral your student!

20:09.237 --> 20:11.159
- Help with this dressing.
- We got a pumper!

20:12.202 --> 20:15.753
- Falling, BP's 70/40.

20:16.004 --> 20:18.886

Go help Weaver.

20:19.053 --> 20:21.392
Get him out of here!
Carter! Now!

20:21.977 --> 20:23.230
Come on.

20:25.485 --> 20:29.245
Sit down. Put your head between
your legs and don't move.

20:31.249 --> 20:33.589
Carter, can you help me
with a crike?

20:33.756 --> 20:35.927
I can't see the cords.
There's too much blood.

20:36.137 --> 20:38.727
- How about a retrograde intubation?
- Ever done one?

20:38.935 --> 20:41.776
I've seen one.
Open up a central-line kit.

20:41.942 --> 20:44.114
Pulse ox, 92. BP, 100/70.

20:44.324 --> 20:46.245
Ricky, get your mother.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.459
Relax, Dad.
Everything's gonna be fine.

20:48.626 --> 20:50.839
Diminished breath.
Hyperresonant to percussion.

20:51.007 --> 20:53.805
- What does that mean?
- He could have a collapsed lung.

20:54.014 --> 20:56.144
- Any tamponade?
- No. Pericardium's dry.

20:56.311 --> 20:57.648
Start internal massage.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.154
Got it. Pulse?

21:00.447 --> 21:01.574
Barely.

21:01.783 --> 21:04.414
- Cross-clamp the aorta.
- Where's the Satinsky?

21:04.582 --> 21:05.793
I'll get another tray.

21:13.479 --> 21:14.523
Take this to Trauma 2.

21:14.689 --> 21:16.946
- Where?
- It's straight ahead.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.083
Doris?

21:22.501 --> 21:24.714
- Carol told me to bring this.
- Put it there.

21:24.881 --> 21:27.639
- Start a mg of atropine.
- Suction. I can't see.

21:27.847 --> 21:29.101
I'll retract the lung.

21:29.351 --> 21:30.354
It's clamped.

21:30.521 --> 21:32.066
- Pulse ox is falling!
- Dad? Dad?

21:32.316 --> 21:33.821
- Unresponsive.
- What's happening?

21:33.988 --> 21:36.034
- Wait outside.
- It's a tension pneumo.

21:36.201 --> 21:37.246
We need a doctor!

21:37.496 --> 21:38.916
I'll need to decompress him.

21:39.125 --> 21:41.464
Pulse weak. BP, 60 palp.
He needs a chest tube.

21:41.673 --> 21:43.344
Well, then give him one!

21:45.098 --> 21:47.813
- Anything?
- Dr. Greene, Jeanie needs you now.

21:47.981 --> 21:50.278
In a minute. I got a boy's heart
in my hand.

21:56.626 --> 21:57.754
Damn, it hurts!

21:57.963 --> 22:00.219
Where does it hurt, Doris?
Where does it hurt?

22:00.428 --> 22:02.641
My stomach! I have to dump!

22:02.891 --> 22:05.315
- Doris, are you pregnant?
- No!

22:06.526 --> 22:08.030
Doris, you're having a baby!

22:08.238 --> 22:10.160
What?! Don't tell me
I'm having a baby!

22:10.368 --> 22:13.460
- Blow! Don't push!
- I don't have to blow, I have to dump!

22:13.668 --> 22:18.388
B.O.A. in Exam 4! I need a doctor!
Now! She's crowning!

22:18.598 --> 22:21.103
Wait, just don't push!
Don't push, Doris!

22:21.354 --> 22:22.816
Don't push!

22:26.074 --> 22:27.118
Oh, my God!

22:30.961 --> 22:33.676
I need some help in here!

22:33.885 --> 22:35.556
My baby! I had a baby!

22:35.723 --> 22:37.895
- He's not breathing.
- All right. Sit back.

22:38.062 --> 22:40.693
- Relax, okay?
- She dropped it! She dropped my baby!

22:40.860 --> 22:42.280
Just relax. Relax, ma'am.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.492
Clamp.

22:43.701 --> 22:45.580
- What's happening?
- Ma'am, just relax.

22:45.790 --> 22:48.337
- No respiratory effort.
- What's wrong with it?

22:48.546 --> 22:51.386
Is it breathing?! Is it dead?!

22:52.556 --> 22:53.976
No palpable pulse.

22:54.101 --> 22:56.482
- Starting compressions. Bag him.
- What did you do?

22:56.650 --> 22:58.403
- What happened?
- She dropped my baby!

22:58.613 --> 23:01.370
Grab a pediatric intubation tray 2.5.

23:01.578 --> 23:06.340
Drop. 02 mgs of epi. I'll tube him.
You start an umbilical line.

23:07.342 --> 23:09.138
Come on, Peter! Now! Let's go!

23:09.347 --> 23:12.230
Scalpel. Where the hell
are the doctors?

23:12.730 --> 23:14.025
Long Kelly.

23:16.197 --> 23:17.575
Damn! I can't find the tract.

23:17.743 --> 23:20.667
Put your finger in and see if
the lung's away from the chest.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.257
- I've never done that.
- You do it.

23:23.507 --> 23:25.679
What are you waiting for?
Will you do it?!

23:29.313 --> 23:30.775
Damn it.

23:30.984 --> 23:32.572
Pulse ox isn't reading.

23:32.780 --> 23:36.372
- Okay, I'm in.
- Another epi. Double it. IV.

23:36.539 --> 23:38.043
- I'm having another one.
- Mark?

23:38.252 --> 23:40.507
- Got it?
- Yeah. Go!

23:40.758 --> 23:42.512
Don't drop this one!

23:43.724 --> 23:45.562
You're not having another baby.

23:45.770 --> 23:48.067
You have to deliver the placenta. Push.

23:48.235 --> 23:49.320
She said not to push.

23:49.530 --> 23:51.492
I want you to push now!

23:51.702 --> 23:54.417
Tube's in. Good breath sounds.
Nice trick, Carter.

23:54.584 --> 23:57.090
- CT ready?
- I'll check.

23:57.299 --> 23:59.596
Help her. She doesn't know
what she's doing.

23:59.763 --> 24:01.142
- What's wrong?
- He's dying!

24:01.309 --> 24:02.770
I'll be right there.

24:02.979 --> 24:04.316
Atropine onboard.

24:04.525 --> 24:06.697
All right. Hold compressions.

24:06.906 --> 24:08.994
- What are you doing?
- Just lie still.

24:09.203 --> 24:12.629
- Max the epi. 15 mgs.
- Blood sugar's only 20.

24:12.795 --> 24:14.257
What's the glucose dose?

24:14.507 --> 24:17.807
Ten percent DW, 20 cc's.
I'll get it.

24:17.974 --> 24:20.522
Carol, she's bleeding.
Get an IV in her.

24:20.731 --> 24:22.945
Two liters, wide open.
Add 10 of Pitocin.

24:23.154 --> 24:26.119
What are you doing?
No. I don't want this nurse.

24:26.329 --> 24:28.166
- Any response?
- No. Nothing.

24:29.044 --> 24:31.634
Come on, man. Come on.

24:32.259 --> 24:33.304
I can't get it.

24:33.471 --> 24:34.891
He's bradying down.
Losing the pulse.

24:35.059 --> 24:36.228
Please, God. Please.

24:40.154 --> 24:41.157
- Got it.
- Where are we?

24:41.324 --> 24:44.498
Tension hemopneumo.
I sent for a doctor. No one came.

24:44.707 --> 24:46.127
Tube's in. Hook me up.

24:46.336 --> 24:48.174
- Is he okay?
- Pulse is coming up.

24:48.341 --> 24:50.764
You dissected this tract with
a Kelly clamp, right?

24:50.931 --> 24:52.226
No, I had to use my finger.

24:54.272 --> 24:56.486
Thank you, Jeanie.
I'll take it from here.

24:56.694 --> 24:58.324
- Kerry, there-
- Now, Jeanie.

24:58.533 --> 25:02.209
Thora-Seal to suction. O-silk.

25:03.671 --> 25:07.137
- Zero form.
- Get some four-by-fours.

25:13.696 --> 25:15.574
You got extension tubing?

25:20.294 --> 25:21.924
How high can we go with the epi?

25:22.133 --> 25:24.263
- How many rounds of atropine?
- Two.

25:27.855 --> 25:31.656
Forget it. He's not responding
to anything. I'm calling it.

25:34.204 --> 25:37.378
Peter. That's it.
He never had a chance.

25:43.393 --> 25:46.735
Time of death: 12:36.

25:48.489 --> 25:52.750
Spin a crit. Type and cross-match for 4.
I'll be back.

26:05.907 --> 26:08.205
Two-fifty. Clear.

26:08.538 --> 26:10.210
Come on. We're not giving up.

26:11.505 --> 26:13.468
Up it to 300. Let's go. Clear.

26:13.718 --> 26:16.098
- Everything okay here?
- Yeah. We got it.

26:16.308 --> 26:19.900
Dr. Weaver, Neuro's gonna meet us
in PICU after the head CT.

26:20.318 --> 26:21.988
Peter, are you coming?

26:22.155 --> 26:23.325
Peter?

26:32.890 --> 26:34.895
Hey, Carla. It's me.

26:35.647 --> 26:37.860
How's the baby?

26:38.070 --> 26:40.200
No, no, no. Everything's fine.

26:40.367 --> 26:41.703
How is he?

26:43.290 --> 26:45.505
Tell me if you feel one poke or two.

26:45.672 --> 26:49.180
Two. Two. One.

26:49.431 --> 26:51.728
Don't draw on your body
in a moving vehicle.

26:51.937 --> 26:53.023
Now you tell me.

26:53.190 --> 26:55.070
It's a good cartoon, though.

26:55.278 --> 26:58.328
Let's get a hand series, a gram of Ancef,
and a tetanus booster.

26:58.495 --> 26:59.873
Aren't you gonna pull it out?

27:00.040 --> 27:04.802
Not yet. We want to get an x-ray
and numb your hand first.

27:05.010 --> 27:07.057
You think I could sue for this?

27:07.517 --> 27:10.232
I'm serious.
I was gonna go to art school.

27:10.399 --> 27:12.237
I should be able to sue somebody.

27:12.404 --> 27:15.328
Great technique back there.
Where'd you learn it?

27:15.955 --> 27:17.124
Dr. Benton showed me.

27:17.292 --> 27:20.925
You were lucky to have him
as a teacher. It's serving you well.

27:27.441 --> 27:29.530
How's that new attitude of yours
holding up?

27:29.739 --> 27:32.036
- Maybe I'll start tomorrow.
- Where's Ivan?

27:32.287 --> 27:35.169
He's in the lounge,
reevaluating his career choice.

27:35.419 --> 27:37.800
Teacher ID'd him as Matthew Blevins.

27:37.967 --> 27:40.807
- Get me when his parents get here.
- He died, didn't he?

27:40.974 --> 27:43.439
Yeah, he did. Hi.

27:43.647 --> 27:45.402
- You want to talk to me?
- It can wait.

27:45.652 --> 27:49.872
Okay. I'm sorry that I barged in on
the asthma kid. His grandma knows me.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.166
What asthma kid?

27:51.960 --> 27:53.547
Yeah. Okay.

27:55.009 --> 27:56.346
Wow, what happened?

27:57.056 --> 27:58.309
How was lunch?

27:59.227 --> 28:02.904
You were lucky, Officer Mulvihill.
Your cervical spine's normal.

28:03.071 --> 28:04.407
Yeah.

28:04.616 --> 28:08.250
But your wrist may require
some surgery.

28:08.459 --> 28:12.093
Orthopedic surgeon will be down shortly.
Here you go.

28:14.349 --> 28:15.852
Mr. Mulvihill?

28:17.690 --> 28:19.194
How bad is it?

28:19.402 --> 28:22.201
It might require a couple of pins.

28:23.412 --> 28:24.791
Not me.

28:25.709 --> 28:27.297
The kids.

28:28.299 --> 28:30.096
How bad are the kids?

28:32.184 --> 28:34.774
Some are very serious...

28:34.941 --> 28:38.574
...but we were able to save
just about everybody.

28:41.916 --> 28:43.253
Just about?

28:45.551 --> 28:47.471
Let me tie off this bleeder.

28:53.152 --> 28:56.243
The Marines have arrived. Cut.

28:56.953 --> 28:58.457
Are you with me, Peter?

28:58.666 --> 29:00.044
Oh, yeah.

29:00.253 --> 29:02.843
You certainly managed to
surprise me this morning.

29:03.051 --> 29:05.808
- And that doesn't happen often.
- What do you mean?

29:06.059 --> 29:10.611
I can read people well, but I didn't
have you pegged as a family man.

29:10.821 --> 29:13.453
- Why not?
- Most surgical residents aren't.

29:14.121 --> 29:17.420
And you strike me
as ambitious, driven.

29:18.966 --> 29:21.723
I wonder how you'll manage it.

29:22.056 --> 29:23.686
Lovely wife, though.

29:24.103 --> 29:25.523
Actually, she's not my wife.

29:26.693 --> 29:29.408
Well, there you go.
You surprised me again.

29:32.248 --> 29:35.465
This place has negative energy.
You're lost in negative energy.

29:35.715 --> 29:38.221
- Dr. Greene, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

29:38.388 --> 29:39.976
Stay where you are.
I'll be back.

29:40.101 --> 29:41.855
Don't give in to it.

29:43.233 --> 29:46.575
Dr. Lowrey from Psych left a note in
his chart when things were crazy.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.497
Yeah, I saw it. Thanks.

29:48.706 --> 29:51.295
I guess she's gonna try to find
the poor guy's family.

29:51.505 --> 29:53.635
Yeah. You surviving all this?

29:53.843 --> 29:57.477
I'm trying. That was pretty amazing
what you were doing in there.

29:57.686 --> 29:59.650
Yeah, well, not amazing enough.

29:59.816 --> 30:00.903
Doc?

30:01.111 --> 30:03.158
- I'll let you get back.
- Okay.

30:03.701 --> 30:06.040
I know a secret.
You wanna hear?

30:06.290 --> 30:08.003
Not particularly.

30:08.170 --> 30:10.342
She likes you.

30:11.553 --> 30:13.935
Hey. You disappeared on me.
What happened?

30:14.143 --> 30:16.983
- You don't want to know. Boy make it?
- No.

30:17.193 --> 30:19.365
I was hoping for some good news.
Talk to Anna?

30:19.573 --> 30:21.578
- About what?
- About the asthma kid.

30:21.787 --> 30:24.795
- She's cool.
- She wasn't cool about it before.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.842
- Really?
- You might want to talk to her.

30:26.967 --> 30:28.095
Why? She talked to you.

30:28.262 --> 30:30.684
- Carol, you got a minute?
- Your turn.

30:30.893 --> 30:32.772
I heard about
your unexpected delivery.

30:32.982 --> 30:34.318
Whose version?

30:34.527 --> 30:35.947
She's screaming for a lawyer.

30:36.114 --> 30:38.202
She's high on something.
Crack, probably.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.960
When she comes down,
she might see things differently.

30:41.127 --> 30:43.590
Fill out an incident report.
Document your account.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.765
She's a crack addict.
That baby popped out, I did not drop it.

30:47.015 --> 30:50.942
But after your suspension, her
accusations might carry more weight.

30:51.193 --> 30:52.947
Can anyone back you up?

30:53.198 --> 30:56.330
- Mark Greene was there.
- Make sure you're on the same page.

30:56.539 --> 30:58.335
- What do we got?
- Motorcycle accident.

30:58.502 --> 31:01.802
Multiple abrasions on the right side,
elbow and abdominal pain.

31:02.012 --> 31:05.144
He was fleeing the police.
Slid 15 feet into a fence.

31:05.395 --> 31:07.024
This the guy they were chasing?

31:07.232 --> 31:09.279
Damn straight!
We finally got the punk.

31:09.530 --> 31:11.994
I wasn't the jerk that ran
into a bus full of kids.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.623
Just the jerk that caused it.

31:13.790 --> 31:15.628
- Oh, bite me, lady!
- Hey! Shut up!

31:15.837 --> 31:17.340
Put him in Suture. Carter!

31:17.507 --> 31:20.557
Take him. I'm afraid I might
stick an IV pole up his ass.

31:20.807 --> 31:22.019
Wouldn't want that.

31:22.186 --> 31:24.942
I checked with upstairs,
and Mr. Melgato is satting well.

31:25.110 --> 31:27.992
- No injuries other than the ribs.
- Good.

31:28.159 --> 31:31.459
I waited to put in that chest tube.
I didn't have a choice.

31:31.667 --> 31:35.259
He had rib fractures. You could've
cut yourself and bled inside him.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.471
But I didn't.

31:36.639 --> 31:39.227
We agreed you wouldn't put your
hands in any cavities.

31:39.395 --> 31:40.815
- What was I to do?
- Walk away.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.486
He would've died.

31:42.694 --> 31:47.331
That's the risk you assume for your
patients when you work here with HIV.

31:48.793 --> 31:50.004
Did you black out at all?

31:50.255 --> 31:51.759
No, I don't think so.

31:51.926 --> 31:54.432
Any trouble breathing? Blurred vision?

31:54.641 --> 31:55.644
No.

31:55.811 --> 31:58.274
BP's 132/88.

31:58.526 --> 32:00.447
So you slid on your right side?

32:00.656 --> 32:01.784
Yeah.

32:03.204 --> 32:05.292
- What's this from, then?
- Guess.

32:06.546 --> 32:09.886
There was a piece of fence sticking out.
He must've rolled into it.

32:10.054 --> 32:11.098
Straight into it?

32:11.266 --> 32:13.228
You tell him, doc!

32:15.316 --> 32:18.324
Okay, Lily. Let's get a CBC,
type and screen.

32:18.533 --> 32:20.621
Lateral C-spine, chest...

32:20.872 --> 32:24.130
...AP pelvis and an abdominal CT.

32:24.339 --> 32:25.551
Surgical consult?

32:25.717 --> 32:28.349
Yeah. No, no, no. He's stable.

32:28.558 --> 32:31.064
Let's wait and get
the abdominal CT first.

32:34.406 --> 32:36.159
Remind me why I do this again.

32:36.369 --> 32:37.580
Because you hate yourself?

32:37.789 --> 32:39.459
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

32:40.420 --> 32:42.718
Mark, you know I didn't drop
that baby, right?

32:43.177 --> 32:44.305
Sure.

32:44.681 --> 32:46.686
Kerry thinks there could be
some trouble.

32:46.894 --> 32:50.946
Well, don't worry. Crack addicts
generally lack credibility.

32:51.155 --> 32:52.658
So I can count on your support?

32:52.826 --> 32:54.956
- I didn't actually see it.
- What's that mean?

32:55.666 --> 32:57.421
It means I didn't see it.

32:57.629 --> 33:01.514
I did not drop that baby. I went to put
the rail down, I told her not to push.

33:01.764 --> 33:04.187
She pushed. I reached for it
but never touched it.

33:04.354 --> 33:05.440
Sure. Whatever.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.236
Mark, I did not drop the baby!

33:07.445 --> 33:10.243
What do you want me to say?
I saw something that I didn't?

33:10.453 --> 33:12.625
No, I would like you to believe me.

33:16.635 --> 33:19.475
Sorry to keep you waiting.
We had a bit of a crisis.

33:19.642 --> 33:21.103
Yes, I saw. Pretty bad, huh?

33:21.313 --> 33:22.649
Yeah.

33:23.025 --> 33:25.448
Well, he seems to be breathing okay.

33:26.366 --> 33:29.625
The puffer isn't working.
I'll give him prednisone. It's a steroid.

33:29.833 --> 33:32.423
He's gonna take one tablet
two times a day.

33:32.632 --> 33:34.805
Can you give him something for
his stomach?

33:36.391 --> 33:39.691
- Stomach's still bothering him?
- Yes. The diarrhea is back.

33:39.858 --> 33:42.950
Diarrhea? Let me take a look.

33:45.873 --> 33:47.210
Does that hurt?

33:47.377 --> 33:49.005
Let's get a stool sample.

33:49.215 --> 33:51.720
Yes, the lady doctor said
he should have one.

33:52.222 --> 33:54.728
The lady doctor? You sure?

33:58.696 --> 34:01.077
- When do I get out of here?
- I have to examine you.

34:01.245 --> 34:02.790
When do I get out of here?

34:02.998 --> 34:05.045
I see your high is wearing off.

34:05.254 --> 34:07.927
- What are you doing?
- Checking your uterus. Lie still-

34:08.136 --> 34:09.639
No, get somebody else. A doctor.

34:09.849 --> 34:11.562
You're stuck with me.

34:12.062 --> 34:14.777
Come on, Doris. Open up. Doris!

34:16.739 --> 34:18.578
I hear you asked for a lawyer.

34:21.795 --> 34:23.590
It was a boy, wasn't it?

34:23.800 --> 34:26.347
Yeah, Doris. It was a boy.

34:26.514 --> 34:29.020
I didn't know I was pregnant.
I swear!

34:29.230 --> 34:31.193
I was so wasted.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.782
If someone told me,
I would've given up the crack.

34:33.949 --> 34:35.454
You can still do that, Doris.

34:38.460 --> 34:41.802
Where is he? Where's my baby?

34:41.969 --> 34:43.181
Just a minute.

34:43.724 --> 34:45.268
What, did they cut him up?

34:46.522 --> 34:48.319
A doctor will talk to you about it.

34:48.527 --> 34:50.364
They never say nothing.

34:56.045 --> 34:58.427
He would've got messed up
with me anyway.

35:03.105 --> 35:05.069
I can have another one, though, right?

35:05.277 --> 35:06.864
I'm okay down there?

35:07.909 --> 35:10.164
Yeah, Doris. You're okay down there.

35:10.372 --> 35:13.797
I'm really sorry, Dr. Carter.
I've never seen that much blood before.

35:14.007 --> 35:15.092
You get used to it.

35:15.302 --> 35:18.727
This isn't gonna affect my evaluation,
is it? I have to get honors.

35:18.936 --> 35:22.402
Get a good night's rest.
We'll start with a clean slate tomorrow.

35:22.611 --> 35:25.284
I'm leaving right now, okay?
You need anything?

35:25.494 --> 35:28.250
All right. How's he doing?
Oh, yeah, I'm coming. Bye.

35:28.501 --> 35:31.842
- Going home early?
- No, I'm leaving on time for once.

35:32.009 --> 35:33.429
Hey, Dr. Benton?

35:34.474 --> 35:36.019
Did you save that girl's arm?

35:36.228 --> 35:38.692
The team is still working on it,
but it looks good.

35:38.859 --> 35:40.572
Oh, that's great. That's great.

35:40.823 --> 35:43.120
- So how's your baby doing?
- He's good.

35:43.329 --> 35:45.334
We need you.
The motorcycle guy's crashing.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.882
- What happened?
- We moved him and he passed out.

35:48.049 --> 35:52.518
- What's the story?
- Motorcycle accident. I'll handle it!

35:54.691 --> 35:56.862
- BP's 50 palp.
- Set up for a lavage.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.701
Set me up for a lavage.

35:59.494 --> 36:02.376
- How many units did you cross-match?
- None. He was stable.

36:02.543 --> 36:04.798
Four units, type-specific.

36:05.341 --> 36:07.723
Two liters of saline.
Why didn't you page me?

36:07.889 --> 36:10.061
- He needed a head CT.
- That's a surgical call.

36:10.271 --> 36:11.816
I was saving time.
You did say-

36:11.983 --> 36:13.570
Carter, the patient is critical!

36:13.737 --> 36:16.201
- He's tachy at 120.
- He wasn't hypertensive.

36:16.452 --> 36:19.293
Crit was normal.
There was no sign of bleeding.

36:19.543 --> 36:22.551
Damn it! Lavage is positive.
Let's get him up to O.R.!

36:22.759 --> 36:24.723
He was stable!

36:32.826 --> 36:35.916
- Thank you.
- Pathology call about that preemie?

36:36.084 --> 36:40.261
No, but Dr. Lowrey called and found
that crazy guy's family in Indiana.

36:40.428 --> 36:43.351
They think he went off his medicine
when he went to college.

36:43.519 --> 36:46.818
His mom's coming. Dr. Lowrey said
go ahead and give him Hadlaw.

36:47.069 --> 36:48.238
You mean Haldol?

36:48.448 --> 36:50.285
Right, Haldol. I'm sorry.

36:50.494 --> 36:52.290
Talk to Greene. He's an Attending.

36:52.458 --> 36:53.920
Talk to Greene about what?

36:54.170 --> 36:55.423
Nothing. Never mind.

36:55.632 --> 36:57.219
Then just confront Benton.

36:57.428 --> 37:00.477
It's not that easy.
I haven't talked to him for months.

37:00.645 --> 37:02.190
Make him talk to you.

37:02.440 --> 37:05.113
You can sulk, or let him
go on treating you like this.

37:05.323 --> 37:07.286
No, I'm gonna talk to him.

37:07.495 --> 37:08.538
Good.

37:08.706 --> 37:12.590
Dr. Del Amico, guess what? You know
Jamie Landeta, the asthma kid?

37:12.800 --> 37:15.807
He doesn't have asthma.
He has strongyloides.

37:15.973 --> 37:18.438
Causes a bronchial irritation,
masks as asthma.

37:18.688 --> 37:21.237
The prednisone would've made it worse.

37:21.445 --> 37:24.411
- Good catch.
- Yeah, one I almost didn't make.

37:26.542 --> 37:28.546
Why didn't you tell me about
the parasite?

37:28.713 --> 37:30.885
- It was a hunch.
- You should've shared it.

37:31.053 --> 37:32.682
I tried. You had it covered.

37:32.890 --> 37:35.689
- We work as a team here.
- Come on! What team?

37:35.940 --> 37:38.697
You could've explained
there were other good doctors.

37:38.863 --> 37:41.286
- Instead, you took the easy way out.
- What? What?!

37:41.913 --> 37:46.006
I'm sorry. This is Mrs. Blevins.
You wanted to talk to her about her son.

37:48.721 --> 37:51.520
- Where is my son?
- Your son was in an accident.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.399
On the bus, I know.

37:53.608 --> 37:54.610
Yes. On the bus.

37:56.699 --> 37:59.163
He suffered multiple injuries,
very grave injuries.

37:59.414 --> 38:01.252
We gave him blood transfusions.

38:01.502 --> 38:06.432
We gave him emergency surgery.
We exhausted all of our capabilities.

38:06.724 --> 38:09.898
But despite our best efforts...

38:10.692 --> 38:14.451
...we were unable to save him.

38:24.184 --> 38:25.395
Mrs. Blevins, he died.

38:33.289 --> 38:35.461
- Need some help?
- No. I got it.

38:43.564 --> 38:47.031
- You have another surgery?
- Yeah. An emergency splenectomy.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.537
- I thought you'd left.
- I did.

38:49.914 --> 38:51.877
Here, I'll do it. You should go.

38:52.085 --> 38:54.132
No, no, no, no. I got it.

38:54.341 --> 38:56.764
Don't be stubborn.
It's your baby's first day home.

38:56.972 --> 38:58.810
I, on the other hand,
have no life.

38:58.977 --> 39:02.027
Look, I appreciate it, but it's okay.

39:02.194 --> 39:05.076
You should take advantage of
my generosity when it's around.

39:05.201 --> 39:07.540
Trust me. You'll see it rarely.

39:10.506 --> 39:11.926
Okay.

39:15.101 --> 39:18.984
- Tell Hicks that I-
- Yeah, yeah. Go. Go!

39:22.744 --> 39:24.499
I knew you'd come back.

39:25.251 --> 39:28.174
- What's that?
- Something to make you feel normal.

39:28.383 --> 39:30.304
I don't want to feel normal.

39:30.513 --> 39:33.521
No, don't run away from it.
Don't run away from the fear.

39:33.896 --> 39:37.906
I know how to deal with it.
You need to make friends with the fear.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.663
What do you mean?

39:41.248 --> 39:43.044
Death is all around.

39:43.253 --> 39:46.302
Stick to the light. Embrace it.

39:46.553 --> 39:48.725
The light will save you!

39:51.022 --> 39:53.111
Dr. Benton!

39:53.319 --> 39:56.034
- Hang on, I want to talk to you.
- Not now, Carter.

39:56.369 --> 39:57.413
No, wait.

39:57.663 --> 40:02.049
For a long time, I bought into
your abuse and your humiliation...

40:02.216 --> 40:04.096
...because I was
learning something.

40:04.263 --> 40:07.438
- You were.
- Even if there was a point to it then...

40:07.646 --> 40:09.443
...there's no point to it now.

40:10.111 --> 40:11.155
Good night, Carter.

40:11.364 --> 40:15.416
I'm tired of you blowing me off!
You're gonna have to talk to me.

40:15.583 --> 40:16.919
You wanna talk?

40:17.128 --> 40:19.258
- You wanna talk now?
- Right now!

40:19.468 --> 40:20.595
Carter...

40:23.603 --> 40:24.688
No.

40:25.273 --> 40:27.111
- Carter, move.
- No.

40:27.487 --> 40:29.283
- Carter, move.
- No.

40:29.450 --> 40:30.495
Get out of my way.

40:30.661 --> 40:32.625
Get off of me!

40:37.637 --> 40:39.141
- You okay?
- What, you care?

40:39.350 --> 40:41.062
- What's wrong?
- I'm not your student.

40:41.229 --> 40:43.150
- I know.
- Then treat me like a colleague.

40:43.318 --> 40:44.780
You're an intern!

40:44.988 --> 40:47.328
For three years
I did everything you asked.

40:47.536 --> 40:49.207
I earned your respect!

40:49.375 --> 40:50.418
And you threw it away!

40:50.585 --> 40:53.342
- Because I'm not like you?
- Because you wasted my time.

40:53.510 --> 40:56.433
This isn't about your time.
This is about your egotism.

40:56.642 --> 40:58.856
Yeah, right, Carter.
I'm egotistical.

40:59.065 --> 41:02.072
A lot of people worked damn hard
to make sure I am where I am.

41:02.240 --> 41:06.375
I gotta be self-centered. I don't
take time for anything. But you...

41:07.085 --> 41:09.257
I did for you, Carter.

41:09.423 --> 41:11.095
I did, man.

41:11.428 --> 41:14.979
You don't want to be a surgeon, you
don't come to me. You go to Anspaugh.

41:15.230 --> 41:17.485
I was afraid you'd talk me out of it.

41:17.694 --> 41:19.657
I wish I had the chance to try.

41:23.918 --> 41:26.173
Hey, okay. You're right. I'm sorry.

41:30.350 --> 41:31.979
Can I go home now?

41:33.023 --> 41:34.527
Yeah.

41:38.579 --> 41:40.124
You know what, Carter?

41:40.333 --> 41:42.714
You don't wanna be treated
like my student?

41:42.880 --> 41:45.137
Stop seeking my approval.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.115
Doug, have you seen Carol?

41:53.323 --> 41:55.913
Yeah. About 5'6", pretty.
Packs an attitude.

41:56.122 --> 41:57.792
- What are you reading?
- Research.

41:58.002 --> 41:59.923
- You?
- Pain management for kids.

42:00.174 --> 42:01.677
It's an idea I had once.

42:01.886 --> 42:03.599
Carol. Carol.

42:04.350 --> 42:06.439
I got that autopsy report
on the crack baby.

42:06.606 --> 42:08.694
He died in utero two days ago.

42:08.862 --> 42:10.909
I guess we're both off the hook.

42:11.159 --> 42:13.749
It wasn't a matter
of me believing you or not.

42:13.916 --> 42:15.336
I would've been on your side.

42:16.004 --> 42:19.137
If you'd been on the patient's side,
this wouldn't have happened.

42:19.304 --> 42:21.852
- What?
- I checked her chart.

42:22.061 --> 42:24.609
That woman was here four times
in seven months.

42:24.776 --> 42:26.906
You saw her twice.
Never did a pregnancy test.

42:27.074 --> 42:28.409
Was there reason to?

42:29.245 --> 42:30.957
Evidently, yes.

42:31.124 --> 42:34.967
We're supposed to give pregnancy tests
to every crackhead who comes in?

42:35.176 --> 42:37.432
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Then what?

42:37.808 --> 42:41.609
God forbid she ever finds out
what her real malpractice suit is.

42:41.776 --> 42:42.904
I would back you up.

42:43.071 --> 42:45.577
Say there was no reason for
a pregnancy test.

42:45.786 --> 42:48.877
- We should've done something.
- What should we have done?

42:49.127 --> 42:51.341
We can't help people who
can't help themselves.

42:52.093 --> 42:56.396
No, Mark. Those are exactly
the people we should be helping.

43:01.992 --> 43:04.582
Good. I'm glad you're still here.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.546
I'm surprised that you are.

43:06.712 --> 43:09.386
Jeanie, I had every right to be angry.

43:09.553 --> 43:11.599
I went to the mat for you.
We had a deal.

43:11.808 --> 43:13.729
I couldn't stand there
and watch him die.

43:13.939 --> 43:14.941
You don't know that.

43:15.108 --> 43:17.447
We were losing a pulse.
It was worth the risk.

43:17.698 --> 43:20.580
You made a decision
to continue working here.

43:20.789 --> 43:24.841
I supported it. But our decisions
affect more than just ourselves.

43:25.049 --> 43:26.804
In this case, a man is still alive.

43:26.971 --> 43:28.182
I appreciate that.

43:28.391 --> 43:30.855
We agreed you'd work under
specific guidelines.

43:31.064 --> 43:33.946
- You have to stick to them.
- I know, I know.

43:36.619 --> 43:40.128
But if I had to do it again,
I can't say I wouldn't do the same thing.

43:48.649 --> 43:49.944
Dr. Greene.

43:51.656 --> 43:53.035
Do you take the El?

43:53.286 --> 43:57.170
No, I drive. I park around the corner.
It's more convenient.

43:57.421 --> 44:00.595
Aren't you afraid your car
will get stolen or scratched up?

44:00.804 --> 44:02.725
Nothing's happened so far.

44:03.853 --> 44:07.696
Do you mind walking me up to
the platform? I get scared at night.

44:07.905 --> 44:10.369
- Where do you live?
- Near Humboldt Park, for now.

44:10.870 --> 44:13.210
- I'll give you a lift.
- I don't wanna be a bother.

44:13.376 --> 44:14.421
No bother.

44:14.630 --> 44:16.760
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Let's go.

44:16.968 --> 44:18.347
Great. Thanks.
