00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.710 --> 00:12.611
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.613 --> 00:14.847
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.849 --> 00:17.616
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.618 --> 00:19.952
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.954 --> 00:22.554
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.556 --> 00:25.457
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.459 --> 00:29.395
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.397 --> 00:33.465
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.467 --> 00:36.468
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.470 --> 00:38.137
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.139 --> 00:40.539
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.541 --> 00:42.975
¶ Sofia ¶

00:42.977 --> 00:45.477
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.479 --> 00:51.617
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:04.698 --> 01:06.698
Are you ready?

01:06.700 --> 01:07.766
And...

01:07.768 --> 01:09.835
- Commence!
- Hee-yah!

01:13.107 --> 01:15.541
- Go, James!
- MOTHER: You can do it!

01:15.543 --> 01:17.342
If I keep up this pace,

01:17.344 --> 01:19.945
it'll be
my best time yet.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.915
James is off
to a good start.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.551
He's been practicing for
this test day and night.

01:25.553 --> 01:26.919
If he keeps up
this pace,

01:26.921 --> 01:28.353
he's certain
to pass it,

01:28.355 --> 01:31.023
and be promoted
to Junior Knight.

01:31.025 --> 01:32.658
Whoa.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.835
- Bull's-eye!
- What a shot!

01:45.239 --> 01:47.272
Ah... the ladder?

01:47.274 --> 01:48.841
No, this is faster.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.649
Yuck!

01:57.651 --> 01:58.650
That can't be good.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.187
Can't... slow down.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.528
And done.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.664
I'm sorry,
Prince James.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.266
The time
has run out.

02:14.268 --> 02:17.569
I'm afraid you have failed
the Junior Knights test.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.404
But, Sir Finnegan,
I wasn't expecting

02:19.406 --> 02:21.340
to get stuck in that mud.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.675
You should never just
jump over a wall

02:23.677 --> 02:25.744
without knowing
what's on the other side.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.514
The ladder would've been
the wiser choice.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.482
You know how
the old saying goes.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.351
Look before you leap.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.687
I know you're
disappointed, James.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.856
But you did well for
your first try.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.692
And you can always
take the test again.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.327
Until then,
practice.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.496
And not just on
the training field.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.698
Try your skills
out in the real world.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.667
Go on an adventure.

02:48.669 --> 02:52.037
That's where you'll learn
the most valuable lessons.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.772
Poor James.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.274
Don't worry.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.509
He'll come back
all the stronger for it.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.645
I should know;
I failed
my first try

02:59.647 --> 03:01.713
at the Junior Knights
test as well.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.349
- ( amulet chiming )
- Oh!

03:06.854 --> 03:09.421
<i> "Tale of the Eternal Torch."</i>

03:15.796 --> 03:18.830
BOOK NARRATOR:
<i> To the dragons who live</i>
<i> on the Blazing Palisades,</i>

03:18.832 --> 03:22.668
<i> their island home</i>
<i> is a fiery paradise.</i>

03:22.670 --> 03:24.169
<i> Inside the tallest peak,</i>

03:24.171 --> 03:27.706
<i> the Eternal Torch burns</i>
<i> with a magical flame</i>

03:27.708 --> 03:30.409
<i> that lights</i>
<i> all the island's fires.</i>

03:30.411 --> 03:33.378
<i> But the Eternal Torch</i>
<i> is in danger.</i>

03:33.380 --> 03:34.980
<i> The sea monsters</i>
<i> who live in the ocean</i>

03:34.982 --> 03:36.848
<i> that surrounds</i>
<i> the Palisades</i>

03:36.850 --> 03:39.718
<i> believe the Palisades</i>
<i> should belong to them,</i>

03:39.720 --> 03:42.020
<i> and now, the sea monsters</i>
<i> have obtained</i>

03:42.022 --> 03:44.823
<i> the powerful</i>
<i> Forever Fountain,</i>

03:44.825 --> 03:47.926
<i> whose magical waters could</i>
<i> drown out the island's fires</i>

03:47.928 --> 03:50.162
<i> and chase the dragons away.</i>

03:50.164 --> 03:52.231
<i> If they are not stopped,</i>

03:52.233 --> 03:54.600
<i> the Blazing Palisades</i>
<i>will belong to the sea monsters</i>

03:54.602 --> 03:56.201
<i> forevermore.</i>

03:56.203 --> 03:58.337
I have to go to
the Blazing Palisades

03:58.339 --> 04:00.472
and give this story
a happy ending.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.676
We'll have to hurry
to get there in time
to help the dragons.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.144
Dragons?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.615
Hope you're up for
a little adventure.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.849
I'll go get you
a snack.

04:12.052 --> 04:15.520
Adventure? This is just
what I've been waiting for.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.693
Here you go, buddy.
One for the road.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.030
( whinnies )

04:25.032 --> 04:27.633
Okay. Time to fly.
Yah!

04:42.316 --> 04:44.383
( James grunting
and groaning )

04:48.656 --> 04:50.622
James, what are you
doing here?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.424
Sir Finnegan said
to practice my knight skills

04:52.426 --> 04:53.925
on an adventure.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.662
I don't know what you're up to,
but sounds perfect.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.897
So you just
stowed away?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.832
I'll be a big help.
You'll see.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.570
Whoa! Look at this place.

05:05.572 --> 05:08.840
If I were a dragon,
this is where I'd want to live.

05:08.842 --> 05:12.477
But I don't think
those are dragons,
are they?

05:12.479 --> 05:13.845
Those are sea monsters.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.281
Dragons and
sea monsters?

05:16.283 --> 05:18.684
Oh, this is getting
better by the minute.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.118
And more dangerous.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.287
I have to warn the dragons
about the sea monsters.

05:22.289 --> 05:25.090
- I can help you.
- I guess it's too late

05:25.092 --> 05:27.159
- to take you back now.
- Yes!

05:27.161 --> 05:30.962
( groans )
What a blazing eyesore.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.699
Well, it's nothing
a good drenching won't fix.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.367
Get a wiggle on, girls.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.968
Keep up with me.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.204
I want to make
a splashy entrance.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.684
Sorry, Aqualina.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.886
I've never been
out of the water before.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.189
Me neither.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.524
I feel so heavy.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.393
You are heavy.
Get off of me!

06:01.395 --> 06:03.729
Oh, come on, girls.
What happened to

06:03.731 --> 06:06.732
my smooth-moving,
sweet-singing monsters?

06:06.734 --> 06:09.801
¶ We are monsters
of the sea ¶

06:09.803 --> 06:14.639
¶ And our sound
will set you free ¶

06:14.641 --> 06:20.345
¶ Oh, free ¶

06:20.347 --> 06:22.647
Oh, that's
more like it.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.584
Now, let's chase away
those dragons

06:25.586 --> 06:28.353
and this island will be
ours at last.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.188
Spread out and look
for a trail

06:30.190 --> 06:32.557
that will get us
up to that peak.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.996
Hm. For invaders,
they look kinda confused.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.232
Good. It'll give us time
to get to Everburn,
the elder dragon,

06:40.234 --> 06:42.234
to warn him.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.903
How do we get to him?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.872
That trail leads to
Everburn's cave,

06:46.874 --> 06:48.573
which is up at the top
of the Palisades,

06:48.575 --> 06:50.575
near the Eternal Torch.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.610
Right. Let's go.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.744
Hold on, James.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.912
We can't just run out there.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.014
They'll see us.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.949
We should hide here
until the coast is clear.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.952
Well, I'm here to
practice my knight skills,

07:00.954 --> 07:02.788
and you said
the torch is that way.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.690
So come on, Sofia.
Let's get to the top.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.426
That's not a dragon.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.861
No. It's just a boy.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.931
But he says that's
the trail to the top.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.633
Ha ha, we found it!

07:14.635 --> 07:16.535
What a stroke
of luck.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.637
Thanks, kid.
I'll say.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.938
Thanks, kid.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.207
Uh-oh.
Hold it right there.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.209
I said go back to--

07:24.211 --> 07:26.411
James, watch out!

07:26.413 --> 07:28.914
Ha ha, now we're
getting somewhere.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.883
The Blazing Palisades
won't be blazing much longer.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.285
Whew!

07:33.287 --> 07:36.955
Thanks.
They almost
pancaked me.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.490
And you showed them the trail
that leads right to

07:38.492 --> 07:39.825
the Eternal Torch.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.828
Hey, I recognize
that voice.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.396
¶ Hello ¶

07:44.398 --> 07:45.831
¶ Hello ¶

07:45.833 --> 07:47.999
¶ Hello ¶

07:48.001 --> 07:49.968
Hello, Princess Sofia.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.070
Did you come back
to hear our encore?

07:52.072 --> 07:53.805
And look, she's
brought someone

07:53.807 --> 07:56.975
who hasn't experienced
the sizzling sounds of...

07:56.977 --> 08:00.612
¶ Smoke, Wings, and Fire ¶

08:00.614 --> 08:02.914
Um, it's great
to see you again,

08:02.916 --> 08:04.349
but there's no time
for singing.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.084
This is an emergency.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.153
Sea monsters are going
to replace the Eternal Torch

08:08.155 --> 08:09.988
with a magic fountain.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.290
There will be water
everywhere instead of fire,

08:12.292 --> 08:14.493
and you won't be able
to live here anymore.

08:14.495 --> 08:18.029
Sea serpents?
Sounds like Aqualina again.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.866
You guys have to help me
get to Everburn and warn him.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.869
You know, there is one thing
we can try first.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.470
There's a bridge
on that trail

08:25.472 --> 08:27.539
that the serpents
will have to cross.

08:27.541 --> 08:28.974
We can take the underground
tunnels and get there

08:28.976 --> 08:30.542
just ahead of them.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.777
Hey, yeah. Then we can
melt the bridge,

08:32.779 --> 08:33.812
and they'll be stuck.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.514
That's a great idea.

08:35.516 --> 08:38.283
But a knight doesn't sneak
around in underground tunnels.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.552
It'll be way faster,
and more knight-like,

08:40.554 --> 08:42.988
if you fly me
to the bridge.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.990
- Come on.
- Good idea, kid.
Let's go.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.559
- Hold on, fellas.
- There he goes again.

08:47.561 --> 08:51.162
Smokely gets so caught up
in the heat of the moment

08:51.164 --> 08:53.965
he does things without
thinking them through.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.300
So does James.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.068
The one thing
you should never do

08:57.070 --> 08:58.937
is fly over
sea monsters.

09:00.474 --> 09:03.341
Look. There they are.
Come on, go, go! Go!

09:03.343 --> 09:06.011
Turn back now,
you slimy serpents.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.913
You're not getting
any further.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.849
Do they really think
they can stop us?

09:10.851 --> 09:13.885
Ha ha. Knock them
out of the sky, girls.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.169
Are you all right?

09:31.171 --> 09:31.937
I'm okay.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.738
Don't look now.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.008
The sea serpents are already
across the bridge.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.777
James, now we missed
our chance

09:38.779 --> 09:41.079
to stop the sea monsters
at the bridge.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.081
I didn't know
they could shoot water.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.183
I tried to warn you,

09:45.185 --> 09:48.053
but you rushed off
before I could say anything.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.622
And you should've
known better, mister.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.123
Those serpents are
crawling along

09:52.125 --> 09:53.625
pretty slowly
on land.

09:53.627 --> 09:54.960
We still have time
to get ahead of them

09:54.962 --> 09:57.562
and warn Everburn
if we go underground,

09:57.564 --> 09:59.798
but we'll
have to move fast.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.968
( snoring )

10:07.741 --> 10:11.209
Um... Mr. Everburn.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.577
Wake up.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.112
Wake up!

10:15.649 --> 10:18.183
It's an emergency.
A huge one.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.222
Sofia, is that
you, kiddo?

10:24.224 --> 10:27.158
Yes, and this is
my brother James.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.893
Pleasure's mine.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.328
So what's with
all the commotion?

10:30.330 --> 10:31.963
Sea monsters
are invading.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.699
Oh, it's always something.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.073
It's that water-logged
sea serpent Aqualina.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.009
We've been feuding with
the serpents

10:44.011 --> 10:45.343
for as long as
I can remember.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.412
Now she wants to replace
the Eternal Torch

10:47.414 --> 10:49.147
with a magic foundation,

10:49.149 --> 10:50.782
and flood
the Blazing Palisades.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.617
Well, we'll see about that.

10:52.619 --> 10:55.086
Ready to give 'em
a warm welcome, boys?

10:59.459 --> 11:02.093
Isn't there any way
you can settle this
peacefully?

11:02.095 --> 11:04.863
Those serpents are trying
to take away our home.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.265
What, you want I should
put out a welcome mat for them?

11:07.267 --> 11:09.034
If there's trouble,
you can count on me.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.102
I'm training to be
a Junior Knight.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.705
Listen, Junior,
thank you so much

11:13.707 --> 11:15.940
sincerely from
the bottom of my heart.

11:15.942 --> 11:19.110
But I want you two
out of harm's way over there.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.845
Keep watch, okay?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.714
But I want to help.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.282
Kid, when you're
the elder dragon,

11:24.284 --> 11:26.117
you can make
the decisions, okay?

11:26.119 --> 11:28.553
But for now, you're
gonna go, sit, watch.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.659
Everburn.

11:34.661 --> 11:38.630
I was wondering if you
dare show your scaly hide.

11:38.632 --> 11:41.399
Oh, go soak your head.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.368
And while you're at it,
get off our island.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.638
Boys, let's give 'em
a warm send-off.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.850
¶ This tiny isle ¶

11:58.852 --> 12:00.251
¶ In the ocean wide ¶

12:00.253 --> 12:01.219
¶ Should be monster kissed ¶

12:01.221 --> 12:02.921
¶ And not dragon fried ¶

12:02.923 --> 12:04.089
¶ So you better split ¶

12:04.091 --> 12:05.590
¶ Or step aside ¶

12:05.592 --> 12:10.829
¶ My claim to this rock
is bona-fide ¶

12:10.831 --> 12:13.732
¶ That means it's real ¶

12:13.734 --> 12:15.900
¶ There's water in the rain ¶

12:15.902 --> 12:17.669
¶ Like there's water
in the sea ¶

12:17.671 --> 12:19.170
¶ Big blue ¶

12:19.172 --> 12:21.339
¶ And that water
will cause a flood ¶

12:21.341 --> 12:23.108
¶ That'll wash you
away from me ¶

12:23.110 --> 12:24.743
¶ You're through ¶

12:24.745 --> 12:26.778
¶ If you know
what's good for you now ¶

12:26.780 --> 12:29.114
¶ You won't make
any fuss ¶

12:29.116 --> 12:32.217
¶ Go take your final bow ¶

12:32.219 --> 12:34.185
¶ 'Cause this island
belongs to us ¶

12:34.187 --> 12:36.521
¶ Yeah, take your final bow ¶

12:36.523 --> 12:39.591
¶ This island
belongs to us ¶

12:39.593 --> 12:40.792
¶ Now shoo! ¶

12:40.794 --> 12:43.595
( laughing )
Tell her, Flambeau!

12:43.597 --> 12:46.364
- ¶ This rock's our home ¶
- ¶ So get off our porch ¶

12:46.366 --> 12:49.067
- ¶ We belong right here ¶
- ¶ With the Eternal Torch ¶

12:49.069 --> 12:52.137
- ¶ All your little plans ¶
- ¶ We're about to scorch ¶

12:52.139 --> 12:57.308
¶ You'll turn into steam
in our fiery forge ¶

12:57.310 --> 12:58.777
¶ That almost rhymes ¶

12:58.779 --> 13:02.080
¶ Like the fire
on the cliff ¶

13:02.082 --> 13:03.982
¶ Like the fire
in the sun ¶

13:03.984 --> 13:05.150
¶ Big heat ¶

13:05.152 --> 13:07.786
¶ There's a fire
in my mouth ¶

13:07.788 --> 13:10.588
- ¶ That'll put you
on the run ¶
- ¶ Retreat ¶

13:10.590 --> 13:13.091
¶ If you know what's good
for you now ¶

13:13.093 --> 13:15.260
¶ There's nothing
to discuss ¶

13:15.262 --> 13:17.896
¶ So take your final bow ¶

13:17.898 --> 13:21.399
¶ 'Cause this island
belongs to us ¶

13:21.401 --> 13:23.401
¶ Yeah, take your final bow ¶

13:23.403 --> 13:26.171
¶ 'Cause this island
belongs to us ¶

13:26.173 --> 13:27.839
¶ You're beat ¶

13:27.841 --> 13:30.775
All this singing
is getting them nowhere.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.744
This could go on
forever.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.779
There's gotta be
a better way

13:34.781 --> 13:37.182
to give this story
a happy ending.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.783
¶ You're beat ¶

13:38.785 --> 13:40.952
¶ If you know
what's good for you now ¶

13:40.954 --> 13:43.087
¶ You won't make any fuss ¶

13:43.089 --> 13:45.623
¶ I'm just warmin' up
my snout ¶

13:45.625 --> 13:47.659
¶ Ha! We're gonna
put your fire out ¶

13:47.661 --> 13:49.527
¶ Oh, yeah ¶

13:49.529 --> 13:50.795
¶ So take your final bow ¶

13:50.797 --> 13:53.164
¶ 'Cause this island belongs ¶

13:53.166 --> 13:56.201
¶ To us ¶

13:56.203 --> 13:59.237
¶ Belongs to us ¶

14:02.209 --> 14:05.510
This is gettin' us
exactly nowhere.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.946
We can't stay here
and block them off forever.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.449
Right. But maybe
something else can.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.518
Pick up the kiddos
and follow me.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.197
This can stop
those slimy eels

14:26.199 --> 14:28.032
in their slippery tracks.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.568
Everyone keeps putting us
on the sidelines.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.704
A knight doesn't
sit on the sidelines.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.239
He asked us to keep watch.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.307
Anyone can keep watch.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.042
I'm training
to be a knight.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.011
I've gotta get in
on the action.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.247
Hey, this big rock
would block the trail

14:42.249 --> 14:44.249
better than a bunch
of small ones.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.683
It'd be like
a wall in itself.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.485
James, no.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.820
The dragons want to
handle this themselves.

14:48.822 --> 14:51.256
- I just...
- Wait.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.590
- ...have to get it--
- James, stop.

14:52.592 --> 14:53.758
...moving.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.128
Oh, no!

15:03.503 --> 15:05.436
Oh, look at them fly.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.972
And I didn't even
have to lift a claw.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.243
There's nothing
to stop them now.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.583
So this is the famous
Eternal Torch.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.518
The dragons believe
it will burn

15:20.520 --> 15:22.353
until the end of time.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.757
Well, they're in for
a big surprise.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.701
( gasps )

15:36.703 --> 15:38.469
The fire's gone.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.940
Let the magic waters
of the Forever Fountain flow,

15:41.942 --> 15:44.142
and turn
the Blazing Palisades into

15:44.144 --> 15:47.045
the Watery Palisades.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.607
Oh, no.
The island's flooded,

16:16.609 --> 16:18.409
and you guys are soaked.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.811
We're half-drowned
is what we are, Sof.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.813
Our magic fire is kaput.

16:21.815 --> 16:25.283
Our beautiful home
is lost forever.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.751
There's gotta be
something I can do

16:26.753 --> 16:28.286
to make things right.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.587
I'm going up there
right now.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.155
Wait a minute, James.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.024
Remember that old saying
Sir Finnegan told you

16:33.026 --> 16:35.093
- after your test?
- Uh, look before you leap?

16:35.095 --> 16:37.528
Right. Well, ever since
you got here,

16:37.530 --> 16:40.365
you've been rushing into
things without thinking
them through first.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.166
Don't you see?

16:42.168 --> 16:44.502
- That's what gotten us
into trouble.
- ( sighs )

16:44.504 --> 16:46.971
We can still help
the dragons.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.707
But we shouldn't
just charge ahead.
We need a plan.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.043
Hmm. Okay.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.012
Um...
well, how about this?

16:54.014 --> 16:57.015
If we put the torch back,
the fires would start again.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.350
That would give
the dragons a fighting chance.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.919
But how do we get past
the sea monsters?

17:03.390 --> 17:05.823
Didn't Aqualina say
she wouldn't rest

17:05.825 --> 17:07.525
until all the fires
were out?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.060
Yeah.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.495
So what do
ya think?

17:10.497 --> 17:11.863
I don't know, kids.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.564
This plan of yours
gives me heartburn.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.200
If it works, you could
get your home back.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.469
But to pull it off,
we'll need help from all of you.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.405
What else have
we got to lose?

17:20.407 --> 17:22.407
- Let's do it.
- BOTH: Yes!

17:22.409 --> 17:24.409
It's paradise.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.712
It's all that
I hoped for and more.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.081
But there's still
a fire burning.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.582
AQUALINA:
That can't be right.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.818
All the fires
should be out.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.921
Come on, girls.
We've got one last
fire to put out.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.225
Here they come.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.493
It's working.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.128
They're coming down
to check the fire.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.503
That's it.
They're gone.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.838
- Let's go--
- James.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.842
Or maybe we should
make sure that was all of 'em.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.449
Okay, that's
the last of 'em.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.983
Now we can go.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.022
Let's hope the dragons
can keep the sea monsters
busy for a while.

18:11.024 --> 18:14.258
What can be keeping
that fluttering nuisance going?

18:17.130 --> 18:19.130
Well, good riddance.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.731
There's another one.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.800
Well, put it out.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.211
Okay, we have to put
the Eternal Torch

18:33.213 --> 18:34.579
back on that pedestal.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.947
There it is.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.482
Help me with it.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.385
That better be
the last one.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.221
No.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.762
I'm confused.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.764
I thought we put
all these out.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.867
AQUALINA: There shouldn't be
any fires left.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.738
There will always be
fire and dragons

19:00.740 --> 19:02.974
on the Blazing Palisades.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.409
So it's a trick.

19:05.411 --> 19:08.479
I thought you dragons
would've been washed out
to sea by now.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.749
Our tails may be soggy,
but we're still here.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.852
Ha ha, there's nothing
left for you now.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.687
Oh, don't be so sure.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.056
I have friends in
very high places.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.096
( straining )

19:36.376 --> 19:38.843
The fire is back?!

19:38.845 --> 19:41.012
That's impossible!

19:41.014 --> 19:42.914
( all exclaiming )

19:45.785 --> 19:49.053
It... is gorgeous.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.655
( laughs )
That's what it is.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.156
The fire is back.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.358
But only for
half the Palisades?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.494
The top half is fire.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.296
The bottom half
is water.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.298
It's so beautiful.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.833
Now all we have to do
is get rid of the fountain.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.735
Wait a minute, Sofia.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.804
I've been just jumping
into things all day.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.740
Maybe we should stop
and think about this one.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.043
You know what?
You're right, James.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.578
It might work out
better for everyone

20:13.580 --> 20:15.613
if we leave things
just as they are.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.983
That beautiful rainbow
is a sign

20:18.985 --> 20:21.819
of what fire and water can be
when they're put together.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.155
Wouldn't it be better
to stop fighting

20:24.157 --> 20:26.023
and see what wonderful
things you can accomplish

20:26.025 --> 20:28.759
living side by side?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.061
What do you say, guys?

20:30.063 --> 20:32.597
Eh, it's
a pretty big island,

20:32.599 --> 20:35.600
so, uh, what the hey?
I guess we can share.

20:35.602 --> 20:39.103
Well, if someone
as stubborn as you
is willing to try it,

20:39.105 --> 20:41.172
then I guess I can, too.
We're in.

20:41.174 --> 20:42.607
( steam sizzles )

20:42.609 --> 20:46.177
Fellas, I think
this calls for a song.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.383
¶ When the water
in the clouds ¶

20:52.385 --> 20:54.018
¶ Meets the sunshine
way up high ¶

20:54.020 --> 20:55.253
¶ Such views ¶

20:55.255 --> 20:57.622
¶ All the water
joins with fire ¶

20:57.624 --> 20:59.757
¶ To light up
the evening sky ¶

20:59.759 --> 21:01.125
¶ Such hues ¶

21:01.127 --> 21:03.194
¶ So we know
what's good for us now ¶

21:03.196 --> 21:05.730
¶ We won't make any noise ¶

21:05.732 --> 21:08.633
- ¶ I know we can get along ¶
- ¶ Doo-doo-doo ¶

21:08.635 --> 21:10.468
¶ And maybe write
a new hit song ¶

21:10.470 --> 21:11.769
¶ Oh, yeah ¶

21:11.771 --> 21:13.437
¶ We're gonna
finish strong ¶

21:13.439 --> 21:14.639
¶ 'Cause this island
belongs ¶

21:14.641 --> 21:16.641
¶ It belongs ¶

21:16.643 --> 21:17.642
¶ To us ¶

21:17.644 --> 21:21.879
¶ Oh, to us, to us! ¶

21:23.916 --> 21:26.317
<i> And with dragons</i>
<i> and sea monsters</i>

21:26.319 --> 21:29.553
<i> living side by side</i>
<i> in harmony,</i>

21:29.555 --> 21:34.925
<i> the island became known as</i>
<i> the Misty Palisades.</i>

21:34.927 --> 21:37.561
Now that looks
just like a happy ending.

21:41.734 --> 21:45.336
Oh. But there's still
one more happy ending to go.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.043
Go, James!

21:57.817 --> 21:59.684
Wait a minute.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.491
Yes!

22:07.493 --> 22:09.360
( panting )

22:09.362 --> 22:10.761
Done!

22:10.763 --> 22:12.797
And with time to spare.

22:12.799 --> 22:15.433
It was wise of you
to check the door

22:15.435 --> 22:17.535
before trying
to bash it down.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.870
Well, my lad,
you passed your test

22:19.872 --> 22:21.138
with flying colors.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.875
You have earned the rank
of Junior Knight.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.844
Congratulations.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.713
Thank you, Sir Finnegan.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.715
Way to go, James.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.350
Well, you know
what they say.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.918
BOTH:
Look before you leap.
