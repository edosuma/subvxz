01:19.177 --> 01:21.581
Alert. C.I.C. to Khara-22.

01:21.614 --> 01:23.082
Prepare for combat.

01:43.903 --> 01:47.774
Moving target spotted,
bearing 07-02, 200 markes.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.909
Assumed to be a Briga cruiser.

01:50.942 --> 01:53.745
Colm 201 squadron, move to confirm.

01:54.846 --> 01:56.782
Colm 201 Alpha, copy.

02:11.597 --> 02:13.366
<i>Kiakra C.I.C., pursuing target.</i>

02:13.399 --> 02:14.933
Request permission to engage.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.170
Permission granted.

02:17.203 --> 02:18.437
Colm 201,

02:18.469 --> 02:21.340
sending Colm 202 and 203
for reinforcement.

02:21.372 --> 02:23.508
Commander, unidentified vessel

02:23.542 --> 02:26.412
confirmed as a Briga escape shuttle.

02:26.444 --> 02:29.314
Why would a Briga
pursue another Briga?

02:30.915 --> 02:33.585
Capture the shuttle.
Top priority.

02:33.618 --> 02:36.588
Colm 201 Alpha,
Briga escape shuttle priority.

02:36.622 --> 02:38.725
Colm 201 Alpha, copy.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.461
<i>Kiakra C.I.C.,
Khara-22 hit.</i>

04:22.494 --> 04:23.929
Airframe damaged.

04:23.961 --> 04:25.664
Copy that, Khara-22.

04:25.697 --> 04:27.065
Activate auto-return mode.

04:27.098 --> 04:29.334
Auto-return mode
activated.

05:57.723 --> 06:00.126
Khara-22, killed in action.

06:00.158 --> 06:02.827
Body can be renovated.

06:02.860 --> 06:06.798
Let's consolidate casualty data
and begin transfer.

06:13.439 --> 06:16.442
Around its blue parent planet,

06:16.475 --> 06:21.013
Gaia circles Annwn, a world at war.

06:21.045 --> 06:23.949
Once this world was controlled

06:23.982 --> 06:27.920
by eight tribes called the Garm...

06:27.952 --> 06:32.524
Briga, Wurm, Basse, Seta,

06:32.557 --> 06:38.430
Borzoi, Zenen, Kumtak, and Columba.

06:39.798 --> 06:44.069
Each tribe had
its own form and language

06:44.101 --> 06:46.070
based on its function,

06:46.103 --> 06:49.574
and they served
the god who created them.

06:51.910 --> 06:57.883
However, Danaan, the Creator,
left this world one day,

06:57.915 --> 07:01.586
and these tribes who were left behind

07:01.620 --> 07:06.591
began to fight each other
for supremacy.

07:06.625 --> 07:09.728
After a long period of conflict,

07:09.761 --> 07:12.231
the atmosphere has been contaminated

07:12.264 --> 07:15.600
and the surface
left covered in ruins.

07:15.634 --> 07:19.104
Of the eight tribes, only three,

07:19.137 --> 07:24.643
the Briga, Columba, and Kumtak,
now remained.

07:24.675 --> 07:26.711
And even the Druids,

07:26.745 --> 07:32.084
said to convey the word of God,
have died out.

07:32.117 --> 07:35.821
The Briga have established
dominance of the surface

07:35.853 --> 07:37.889
with their military might.

07:40.559 --> 07:46.032
The Columba rule the skies
by deploying mechanized units.

07:48.533 --> 07:52.204
The Kumtak have
barely managed to survive

07:52.237 --> 07:57.510
by offering their superior
information technology to Briga.

08:03.548 --> 08:09.521
The Briga and Columba, the two
great tribes of land and air,

08:09.555 --> 08:14.793
were about to begin battle
of dominance over Annwn.

09:49.988 --> 09:52.391
Data consolidation complete.

09:52.423 --> 09:56.728
<i>Thank you for your brave service
to the Kiakra, Khara-22.</i>

09:56.761 --> 10:01.366
New identification code
for the squadron is Khara-23.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.199
Type, Kumtak.

10:34.231 --> 10:35.933
I.D. code unknown.

10:35.966 --> 10:37.936
Accessing auxiliary brain.

10:37.969 --> 10:39.438
Infiltrating memory hive.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.440
Function, system analysis

10:41.472 --> 10:45.076
and interrogation,
also information management.

10:45.110 --> 10:48.180
Consistent with the Kumtak
information officers

10:48.212 --> 10:49.814
serving the Briga.

10:49.847 --> 10:52.216
Scan the Garm terminal access log.

10:52.250 --> 10:56.321
Last access, minus-3716 sen.

10:56.354 --> 10:58.956
His breach
was minus-2517 sen.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.870
You're telling me he's been
off the Garm network

11:00.892 --> 11:02.261
for over a thousand sens.

11:02.293 --> 11:04.896
He must be
operating as a stand-alone.

11:04.929 --> 11:06.665
What about that other individual?

11:11.135 --> 11:12.437
Type, unknown.

11:12.471 --> 11:15.340
Function, unknown.

11:15.373 --> 11:17.475
There's a powerful firewall

11:17.509 --> 11:20.012
in the subject's auxiliary brain.

11:20.044 --> 11:22.080
Could be a trap.

11:22.114 --> 11:26.185
Auxiliary brain manipulation
is a Kumtak specialty.

11:26.217 --> 11:27.919
Try the Kumtak's memory nest again.

11:27.952 --> 11:30.088
See what he knows
about the other subject.

11:30.121 --> 11:33.858
Scanning. Extracting.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.396
Type, Druid.

11:37.428 --> 11:39.497
I.D. code unknown.

11:39.530 --> 11:41.132
-A Druid?
-A Druid?

11:41.166 --> 11:43.402
-Impossible.
-A Druid?

11:43.434 --> 11:47.004
For the sake of argument,
let's say it is a Druid.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.206
The more important question

11:48.240 --> 11:50.875
is not one of existence,
but of action.

11:50.908 --> 11:53.511
What would drive a Kumtak
to flee the Briga?

11:53.544 --> 11:56.014
If the terminal access logs
are correct,

11:56.047 --> 11:58.884
he's been on the run for some time.

11:58.917 --> 12:01.854
We've no choice
but to interrogate them directly

12:01.886 --> 12:04.489
if we're to learn
anything of substance.

12:04.523 --> 12:06.524
Wait.
Trace data detected

12:06.557 --> 12:09.227
in the type-Druid's headgear
and secondary buffer.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.261
Extracting.

12:26.344 --> 12:28.814
Is that...

12:28.846 --> 12:30.515
Danaan?

13:00.144 --> 13:01.913
Are you the Columba pilot

13:01.947 --> 13:03.849
that died trying to save us?

13:15.493 --> 13:17.229
What if I am?

13:19.163 --> 13:20.365
Thank you.

13:22.933 --> 13:25.903
I was just following orders.

13:25.937 --> 13:27.505
Maybe so,

13:27.538 --> 13:30.975
but it seems like someone else
would like to thank you.

13:32.576 --> 13:35.847
You seem entitled
to receive a blessing,

13:35.880 --> 13:39.451
although that would be
for a Gula to decide.

13:46.957 --> 13:49.928
Garm in this ship
restrict a Gula's movement?

13:54.899 --> 13:57.201
To be touched by a Gula

13:57.235 --> 14:01.340
is to receive a blessing
of great fortune and protection.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.041
To the best of my knowledge,

14:03.073 --> 14:07.579
Nascien is the only one
the Gula's ever blessed.

14:10.981 --> 14:12.483
Would you care to try?

15:30.361 --> 15:32.029
Where is the Gula?

15:32.062 --> 15:36.434
A Gula is always searching
for someone or something.

17:13.431 --> 17:15.800
How did you get down here?

17:31.516 --> 17:32.584
Gula!

17:44.729 --> 17:47.365
Interrogation will commence.

17:47.397 --> 17:52.636
Kumtak, who is that individual
you fled the Briga with?

17:52.670 --> 17:55.474
My dear interrogator,

17:55.507 --> 18:00.512
you are aware of the existence
of the Sage of the Trees,

18:00.545 --> 18:04.115
those who convey all the words
of our creator, Danaan?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.486
If by the Sage of the Trees,

18:07.519 --> 18:09.453
you mean Druids, then yes.

18:09.487 --> 18:14.326
We are familiar with both
their existence and extinction.

18:14.358 --> 18:16.827
Yes, along with the Wurm, the Basse,

18:16.861 --> 18:21.166
the Seta, the Borzoi, and the Zenen,

18:21.199 --> 18:25.370
all extinct
after years and years of war.

18:25.403 --> 18:28.673
Now with the Kumtak near extinction,

18:28.705 --> 18:30.674
only the Columba and the Briga

18:30.708 --> 18:33.879
remain in any significant numbers.

18:33.912 --> 18:35.713
Your point, Kumtak?

18:35.747 --> 18:37.382
Every Garm knows this.

18:37.414 --> 18:40.585
These are keystone memories
of our collective database.

18:40.617 --> 18:43.888
Yes, but just because
you commit something to memory

18:43.922 --> 18:46.290
does not make it a fact.

18:46.324 --> 18:47.625
In our collective memory,

18:47.659 --> 18:51.796
the last of the Druids
were killed off long ago,

18:51.828 --> 18:56.167
but the truth is, one survives.

19:00.904 --> 19:04.408
Druids are said to have
access to tremendous power,

19:04.442 --> 19:06.678
and if that power could be harnessed,

19:06.711 --> 19:10.214
then total systems dominance
could be achieved.

19:10.248 --> 19:13.418
That, at least,
was the thinking of the Briga.

19:13.451 --> 19:16.254
The Briga tried to use
the power of the Druids?

19:16.287 --> 19:19.223
That sounds like
something they would think of.

19:19.257 --> 19:22.727
There are stories that a Kumtak
once tried to use Druids

19:22.759 --> 19:25.931
to gain the power of Danaan
and challenge the Briga.

19:40.811 --> 19:45.849
But that Kumtak's ambitions
brought great shame to his pack,

19:45.883 --> 19:48.819
and he was ousted from the clan
as a heretic.

19:48.853 --> 19:50.455
Surely there's no need

19:50.488 --> 19:53.325
to follow in the footsteps
of that Kumtak

19:53.357 --> 19:55.961
who played with systems
beyond his comprehension

19:55.993 --> 19:57.795
and ended up a pariah.

19:59.396 --> 20:02.933
No matter how much the Columba boast

20:02.967 --> 20:04.736
of their speed and mobility,

20:04.769 --> 20:07.605
the Brigas' mighty warships
and armored forces

20:07.638 --> 20:10.541
remain as great a threat as ever.

20:10.575 --> 20:13.711
Would you not call
attacking a powerful enemy

20:13.744 --> 20:16.447
the very height of foolishness?

20:16.480 --> 20:18.717
So why have you come to us?

20:18.750 --> 20:20.451
The Briga and the Kumtak

20:20.484 --> 20:22.987
have been united
for countless cycles.

20:23.020 --> 20:27.291
Enslaved, not united.

20:27.325 --> 20:29.294
So you've come to offer us

20:29.326 --> 20:32.263
the power of the Druids
against the Briga

20:32.297 --> 20:35.433
in exchange for your tribe's freedom?

20:38.903 --> 20:41.573
If that is what you want,

20:41.605 --> 20:45.243
then, yes, that is what I'm offering.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.482
Gula.

21:08.732 --> 21:10.367
Gotcha.

21:10.401 --> 21:12.037
Kumtak...

21:12.069 --> 21:14.505
you say that by combining our power

21:14.538 --> 21:17.942
with that of the Druid,
we can destroy the Briga.

21:17.974 --> 21:21.379
How do we know
that what you say is true?

21:22.880 --> 21:24.849
If you allow me access

21:24.882 --> 21:26.584
to this ship's information core,

21:26.616 --> 21:29.953
I will combine it with the Druid's,

21:29.987 --> 21:34.058
and you will see firsthand
the true power of the Druid.

21:34.092 --> 21:35.759
Don't be ridiculous, Kumtak.

21:35.792 --> 21:38.729
You'll trigger an overflow
and destroy the braincase.

21:38.762 --> 21:41.066
Sir, you aren't seriously considering

21:41.098 --> 21:42.866
giving him access, are you?

21:42.900 --> 21:44.069
The Kumtak are notorious

21:44.102 --> 21:45.970
for their skills
at manipulating data.

21:46.002 --> 21:48.605
How do we know
what this Kumtak says is true,

21:48.638 --> 21:50.442
that it's not all some elaborate trap

21:50.474 --> 21:52.009
by the Briga, sir?

21:52.042 --> 21:55.813
<i>Give the Kumtak access
to the Kiakra's main core.</i>

21:55.846 --> 21:56.980
Sir!

21:57.013 --> 21:59.583
There is a Druid standing before you,

21:59.616 --> 22:00.851
a Druid.

22:00.884 --> 22:03.922
Don't you understand what this means?

22:03.954 --> 22:06.490
Give the Kumtak access now.

22:06.523 --> 22:07.725
Yes, sir.

22:07.759 --> 22:11.462
Port opened
in the staging area firewall.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.432
Thy right hand
shall teach them to fear thee.

22:15.700 --> 22:19.938
See for yourself
the power of the Druids.

23:11.622 --> 23:17.495
Danaan, you make yourselves
known to us only in visions.

23:17.528 --> 23:20.498
We only speak to you in dreams.

23:20.530 --> 23:21.499
Stop it!

23:21.531 --> 23:23.500
Cut her off! Cut her off!

23:28.772 --> 23:32.509
Behold the power of the Druids!

23:53.029 --> 23:54.833
All right, listen up.

23:54.865 --> 23:56.166
Our primary objective

23:56.200 --> 23:59.636
is to take back
the Kumtak and the Druid alive.

23:59.670 --> 24:00.971
Ignore the Gula.

24:01.005 --> 24:03.107
Any Columba, you kill on sight.

24:03.140 --> 24:05.844
Team one, take care
of the sleep hive.

24:05.876 --> 24:07.544
Team two, hit the hangar

24:07.577 --> 24:09.913
and ground
as many Six-Wings as you can.

24:09.946 --> 24:13.083
Now the rest of you, follow me.

24:29.567 --> 24:31.769
Illegal access
into the ship's information core

24:31.801 --> 24:33.570
<i>detected from the Kiakra.</i>

24:33.604 --> 24:36.106

24:38.041 --> 24:39.843
Fire-control section
isolated, too!

24:39.876 --> 24:41.879
Shipboard security systems offline.

24:41.913 --> 24:43.580
Navigation and control systems

24:43.614 --> 24:45.014

24:46.851 --> 24:49.187
Set the C.I.C.
to autistic mode now!

24:53.824 --> 24:55.727
Share combat information center.

24:55.759 --> 24:58.762

all of the main building.

24:58.796 --> 25:01.866
<i>Colm 301

25:03.901 --> 25:05.737
<i>Air patrol to Kiakra C.I.C.</i>

25:11.241 --> 25:12.943
Prepare to launch aircraft.

26:53.443 --> 26:57.280
I was wondering how I was
gonna get this thing open.

26:57.314 --> 26:58.750
Don't even try, Kumtak.

26:58.782 --> 27:00.817
We're taking you and your little doll

27:00.851 --> 27:02.821
back to Briga command.

29:00.136 --> 29:01.471
<i>Contact the Rosmerta.</i>

29:01.505 --> 29:03.374

29:03.406 --> 29:05.109
Now let's move.

30:25.588 --> 30:28.158
Six-Wing
closing behind us.

30:28.192 --> 30:30.060
Lose them!

30:30.094 --> 30:32.029
They're coming in too fast.

37:48.498 --> 37:51.034
Kumtak!

37:51.068 --> 37:53.336
Is this some kind of joke?

37:59.909 --> 38:01.077
The Torc Sea,

38:01.110 --> 38:03.746
where the corrupted land
of the Garm ends

38:03.780 --> 38:06.417
and the sacred land
of the Druids begin.

38:06.449 --> 38:09.653
You said this was
the way back to Briga command.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.957
I have no intention
of returning to the Briga.

39:08.177 --> 39:10.847
Kumtak,

39:10.880 --> 39:13.416
get this Gula out of the way.

39:21.090 --> 39:24.961
Even an obstinate Briga
like him knows it's a grave sin

39:24.994 --> 39:27.897
to kill one
who's been blessed by Gula.

39:55.224 --> 39:57.527
You used manna.

39:57.561 --> 40:00.764
It makes you faster, stronger,

40:00.797 --> 40:03.534
allows you to heal more rapidly

40:03.567 --> 40:06.036
than if you were in your sleep hive.

40:09.005 --> 40:11.742
But there's a price to pay.

40:11.775 --> 40:14.010
If you use too much at once,

40:14.043 --> 40:17.614
your body will destroy itself
from within,

40:17.646 --> 40:21.985
accelerating your metabolism,

40:22.018 --> 40:25.423
aging you, wearing you out.

40:29.226 --> 40:32.061
You talk like you know
more about the Garm

40:32.094 --> 40:33.863
than they know about themselves,

40:33.896 --> 40:37.000
like you've forgotten
you're one of us.

40:37.032 --> 40:38.168
Have you ever wondered

40:38.201 --> 40:40.670
what it truly means to be a Garm?

40:40.704 --> 40:43.907
Our core memories are so limited.

40:43.940 --> 40:47.811
Think. Your weapons,

40:47.844 --> 40:50.947
the Columba carriers,
the Briga cruisers,

40:50.981 --> 40:54.218
the systems that operate them all,

40:54.251 --> 40:57.888
nothing was created by the Garm.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.722
How long have they existed?

41:01.724 --> 41:04.494
No matter how hard
we trace our memories

41:04.527 --> 41:07.063
or how we trace the records,

41:07.097 --> 41:09.800
the answer's the same.

41:09.833 --> 41:12.936
Nothing is created by the Garm.

41:12.969 --> 41:15.606
They've existed
from the very beginning.

41:17.007 --> 41:19.809
The Garm don't create.

41:19.842 --> 41:21.478
We maintain.

41:26.148 --> 41:29.185
If we don't know where we came from,

41:29.219 --> 41:31.222
how would we know where we're going?

41:42.731 --> 41:43.733
Heresy.

41:43.766 --> 41:46.769
What you're saying is heresy.

41:46.802 --> 41:49.605
A Garm fulfills his mission.
That's all.

41:49.639 --> 41:50.841
Is it?

41:54.143 --> 41:56.079
Do you know where you are?

41:58.047 --> 42:01.150
Do you know what that is?
The Torc Sea.

42:01.184 --> 42:02.853
Danaan, our creator, made it

42:02.885 --> 42:06.657
to separate the Garm
from the lands of the Druids.

42:08.123 --> 42:10.893
Those lands are
forbidden to Garm like us.

42:10.927 --> 42:14.631
Only there can I follow
the memories of Danaan,

42:14.664 --> 42:17.100
who vanished from these lands.

42:17.132 --> 42:18.568
Danaan?

42:29.211 --> 42:31.081
Don't you?

42:31.114 --> 42:35.085
Don't you want to know
why our creator left us?

43:11.054 --> 43:13.222
Once we cross the Torc Sea,

43:13.255 --> 43:15.391
Nascien will lead me to Dual Grund,

43:15.425 --> 43:17.027
where I can gain access

43:17.059 --> 43:20.230
to the upper-level systems
of the Druids.

43:20.262 --> 43:23.800
That is where the truth
behind Danaan's absence lies.

43:26.302 --> 43:28.072
And what about me?

43:29.304 --> 43:31.007
And the Briga?

43:31.041 --> 43:34.211
You just expect us to follow you?

43:34.244 --> 43:35.879
Cut off from your packs,

43:35.911 --> 43:38.748
Garm like you will die
wandering in the wasteland.

43:40.050 --> 43:42.019
Your memories will not be downloaded.

43:42.052 --> 43:45.021
You will not reawaken
in your sleep hive cells.

43:45.054 --> 43:46.288
But in Dual Grund,

43:46.322 --> 43:49.826
you may find another fate
waiting for you.

43:49.858 --> 43:52.996
What, I cannot say.

43:53.028 --> 43:57.233
But cut off from your pack
as you are, the choice is yours.

44:01.336 --> 44:03.706
The tide is rising.

44:03.739 --> 44:05.274
Are you coming or not?

44:19.822 --> 44:22.291
Where do you think
you're going, Kumtak?

44:23.960 --> 44:28.766
Across the Torc Sea to Dual Grund.

44:32.936 --> 44:34.471
You're not going anywhere.

44:34.503 --> 44:37.907
My mission's to take you
back to Briga command.

44:39.275 --> 44:40.711
You can die now

44:40.744 --> 44:43.146
or later on your own
out in the wasteland,

44:43.179 --> 44:44.914
but we're going to Dual Grund.

44:49.284 --> 44:52.221
You're not gonna
make it across on foot.

44:54.289 --> 44:55.425
Get on.

44:59.896 --> 45:02.132
Why should I trust you, Briga?

45:02.164 --> 45:05.367
'Cause if I could kill
a Garm blessed by a Gula,

45:05.400 --> 45:07.203
you'd already be dead.

45:07.237 --> 45:12.509
I've come too far to let this
crazy Kumtak just walk away.

45:12.541 --> 45:14.777
You wanna go to Dual Grund?

45:14.811 --> 45:15.946
I'll take you.

45:15.978 --> 45:18.380
Once your business there is finished,

45:18.414 --> 45:21.184
I'm gonna take this crazy Kumtak
and the Druid

45:21.217 --> 45:22.419
back to Briga command,

45:22.452 --> 45:26.022
and the Gula could do
as the Gula pleases.

45:26.054 --> 45:28.491
Deal.

45:28.525 --> 45:31.195
So you do have some sense, Columba.

45:33.195 --> 45:36.799
It's Khara, Khara-23.

45:39.568 --> 45:41.804
You're telling me
your generation code?

45:44.206 --> 45:46.909
That information's
only shared within a pack.

45:46.943 --> 45:51.281
I am Wydd, Wydd-256.

45:54.150 --> 45:59.189
The Druid is Nascien-666.

46:00.322 --> 46:01.958
You're kidding me.

46:09.431 --> 46:10.800
I'm Skellig...

46:13.036 --> 46:14.972
Skellig-58.

46:29.052 --> 46:33.023
These people
who have all lost their packs

46:33.056 --> 46:35.992
miraculously meet and begin

46:36.025 --> 46:39.095
their pilgrim's journey
to the holy land

46:39.128 --> 46:43.533
in search of the memories
of the Garm.

48:33.309 --> 48:35.178
Not bad.

48:39.382 --> 48:41.483
Funny.

48:41.516 --> 48:44.721
A Gula can live where birds are,

48:44.753 --> 48:46.422
but we can't.

48:48.391 --> 48:51.094
How much manna do we have left?

48:51.126 --> 48:53.329
Three selmas,

48:53.362 --> 48:56.198
if we're strict with rationing.

48:56.231 --> 48:58.201
And there'd be even less

48:58.233 --> 49:01.637
if the Druid didn't seem
to be surviving off her...

49:01.670 --> 49:04.073
connection with these stones.

49:04.106 --> 49:08.143
Even if we make it to Dual Grund,

49:08.177 --> 49:13.050
if there's no manna there,
we're finished.

49:14.516 --> 49:16.618
You're regretting your decision?

49:19.088 --> 49:22.659
A Briga never regrets his actions.

49:22.692 --> 49:24.661
You remember that.

50:34.197 --> 50:35.664
I came to relieve you.

50:41.436 --> 50:43.072
I'm fine.

50:44.873 --> 50:46.576
Go back to sleep.

50:48.643 --> 50:52.281
I can't sleep when Wydd
sleeps so soundly.

50:52.315 --> 50:55.385
What does he know that we don't?

50:55.418 --> 50:57.287
I thought you trusted him.

50:57.320 --> 50:58.722
Hardly.

51:00.489 --> 51:03.192
I can't shake the feeling
that he had something to do

51:03.226 --> 51:05.262
<i>with the disaster
that brought down the Kiakra.</i>

51:06.728 --> 51:08.530
Well, if you can't trust him,

51:08.563 --> 51:11.634
what makes you think
you could trust a Briga like me?

51:13.302 --> 51:15.137
We have a deal.

51:16.572 --> 51:18.240
Unbelievable.

51:19.842 --> 51:23.378
If you're a code 23,

51:23.411 --> 51:27.083
that means you have a long
service record as a warrior.

51:28.550 --> 51:30.253
A Garm without a pack

51:30.286 --> 51:33.289
tends to throw caution to the wind.

51:33.322 --> 51:36.159
If that's true, I'm not the only one.

51:37.693 --> 51:39.362
It's not the same thing.

51:41.496 --> 51:44.266
I have my mission.

51:44.300 --> 51:46.236
You made a choice.

51:47.936 --> 51:50.339
Out here,
is there really a difference?

51:57.246 --> 51:59.849
Go get some rest.

51:59.882 --> 52:02.418
If I need relief, I'll...

52:02.451 --> 52:04.420
I'll come and wake you.

52:05.954 --> 52:08.157
I told you I'm not tired.

52:37.586 --> 52:39.188
Do you, um...

52:44.827 --> 52:46.696
What did it feel like,

52:46.728 --> 52:48.797
to be touched by a Gula?

52:48.831 --> 52:50.533
Do you feel...

52:50.565 --> 52:52.234
Do you feel any different?

52:55.471 --> 52:56.873
It's just...

53:00.710 --> 53:02.913
I don't know how to explain it.

53:04.746 --> 53:06.848
She drools a lot.

53:06.882 --> 53:08.818
Is it, um...

53:08.851 --> 53:10.487
Was it sticky?

53:18.927 --> 53:22.364
I felt something warm and soft
when she touched me...

53:25.300 --> 53:29.304
not on the outside,
but on the inside,

53:29.338 --> 53:31.307
if that makes any sense.

53:34.777 --> 53:36.579
And her scent...

53:39.414 --> 53:41.985
I feel like I've smelled it
somewhere before.

53:45.987 --> 53:47.523
I don't know.

53:48.990 --> 53:51.360
Your Briga pack
didn't have any Gulas?

53:58.934 --> 54:00.903
We used to.

54:00.936 --> 54:04.507
I never saw one, no.

54:04.539 --> 54:06.541
Gulas are short-lived,

54:06.574 --> 54:08.777
and clones are forbidden.

54:17.820 --> 54:19.889
Skellig, what's your first memory?

54:30.099 --> 54:33.303
Target practice maybe?

54:34.737 --> 54:35.905
Mission briefing?

54:35.938 --> 54:39.008
No, back further.

54:39.041 --> 54:42.746
What's the first thing that you
can recall ever experiencing?

54:45.581 --> 54:48.017
For me, I think...

54:48.050 --> 54:51.788
the first thing that I ever saw
was light coming in

54:51.820 --> 54:54.023
when my sleep hive cell opened up.

54:55.990 --> 54:58.661
Your first memory isn't
something similar to that?

55:00.963 --> 55:03.333
So what if it is?

55:03.365 --> 55:04.733
We're Garm.

55:04.766 --> 55:07.469
We fight. We die. We download.

55:10.606 --> 55:14.444
Being around the Druid's
going to your head, Columba.

55:14.476 --> 55:16.745
"What is your first memory?"

55:16.778 --> 55:18.748
Why is it any more important

55:18.780 --> 55:22.485
than your third
or your tenth or your last?

55:22.518 --> 55:25.722
Skellig, why are there no young Garm?

55:25.755 --> 55:28.657
Gulas give birth to pups.

55:28.690 --> 55:33.562
Even birds at the Torc Sea lay...
Raise chicks from eggs.

55:33.596 --> 55:36.498
Why is it just the Garm
that have no young?

55:37.833 --> 55:39.869
Danaan created us that way.

55:41.871 --> 55:44.907
Why would Danaan create
the Garm to be like that?

55:44.940 --> 55:46.376
What was the point?

55:46.409 --> 55:49.778
Is that why
you wanna go to Dual Grund?

55:49.811 --> 55:52.348
What, to... to find answers?

55:53.416 --> 55:54.851
I don't know.

55:58.554 --> 56:01.523
You asked if something changed
when Gula touched me,

56:01.556 --> 56:02.925
and something did.

56:04.626 --> 56:05.927
I don't know what,

56:05.960 --> 56:07.729
but something inside of me changed,

56:07.762 --> 56:11.166
and if going to Dual Grund
tells me what that something is,

56:11.199 --> 56:12.701
then so be it.

56:24.947 --> 56:26.115
You should go.

56:33.822 --> 56:35.157
Go.

57:11.092 --> 57:13.695
Visibility's shot!

57:13.728 --> 57:16.097
I can't see anything, just this fog.

57:16.130 --> 57:18.934
It's too dangerous to keep going.

57:18.967 --> 57:20.168
We're stuck.

57:20.202 --> 57:22.605
Wait.

57:22.637 --> 57:24.940
I think the fog's thinning out.

57:24.974 --> 57:27.710
Skellig, there on the left.

57:27.742 --> 57:30.712
Distance, 390 nortes.

57:30.746 --> 57:32.882
What is that, a hill?

57:58.273 --> 58:00.909
I've heard the birds
can travel from this world

58:00.943 --> 58:02.778
to the other using their wings.

58:04.313 --> 58:06.749
The place where the world ends

58:06.782 --> 58:08.818
and the world begins.

58:08.851 --> 58:10.487
Dual Grund.

58:12.655 --> 58:14.990
This is the place,

58:15.023 --> 58:19.895
the exact vision that Nascien
projected in my sleep.

58:19.929 --> 58:21.797
In your sleep?

58:21.829 --> 58:24.032
You mean you dream?

58:24.065 --> 58:25.768
I thought only the Gula

58:25.800 --> 58:28.036
were blessed
with the ability to dream

58:28.070 --> 58:30.673
until I met Nascien.

58:36.679 --> 58:39.215
I've never doubted

58:39.248 --> 58:41.918
or regretted my decisions, and yet...

58:44.119 --> 58:47.289
coming to the holy land,

58:47.322 --> 58:49.958
it could bring disaster to the Briga.

58:49.992 --> 58:53.162
There's no turning back now,
not for us,

58:53.195 --> 58:54.963
nor for the world.

58:56.364 --> 58:59.768
If we are the harbinger
of things to come,

58:59.802 --> 59:02.137
what lies ahead?

59:02.170 --> 59:04.205
If that was not the case,

59:04.239 --> 59:08.577
then why would a heretic like me
and Nascien have turned up?

59:08.610 --> 59:13.215
And you can't say that Khara
willingly left her pack.

59:15.317 --> 59:18.253
Neither did I, I suppose.

59:20.722 --> 59:23.025
Perhaps we'll have
a more different future

59:23.057 --> 59:25.561
if Danaan's curse is lifted.

59:26.996 --> 59:28.664
The future.

59:30.798 --> 59:33.768
That's such an absurd concept.

59:33.802 --> 59:38.974
Briga, all we have is the future.

59:39.007 --> 59:41.009
Kumtak.

59:43.344 --> 59:45.614
Guess there's no turning back now.

01:01:14.001 --> 01:01:16.072
Cold feet, Skellig?

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:21.443
Only way forward's on foot.

01:01:21.476 --> 01:01:23.344
Someone's gotta be backup,

01:01:23.378 --> 01:01:27.450
and I'm the only one that knows
how to work this thing.

01:01:29.518 --> 01:01:31.820
You keep your com channel open.

01:01:31.853 --> 01:01:34.856
You run into trouble,
just say the word.

01:01:37.525 --> 01:01:39.127
Khara...

01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:45.134
What?

01:01:48.469 --> 01:01:50.138
It's the first time...

01:01:56.545 --> 01:01:59.481
It's the first time
you called me by name.

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:09.358
What about you?

01:02:09.391 --> 01:02:10.992
I, um...

01:02:11.025 --> 01:02:14.062
I don't need as
much manna as you.

01:02:14.096 --> 01:02:17.300
Besides, I got my pal here
if anything goes wrong.

01:02:23.871 --> 01:02:25.373
You said there was something

01:02:25.407 --> 01:02:28.077
you wanted to
find out at Dual Grund.

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:33.315
Go find out.

01:02:33.347 --> 01:02:37.853
Go find out if there's a future
waiting for us, for the Garm,

01:02:37.885 --> 01:02:40.856
something that's
different than this.

01:02:45.126 --> 01:02:46.262
Go.

01:04:53.588 --> 01:04:56.057
Skellig, there's something in here.

01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:58.326
80 markes ahead.
Do you see it?

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.062
I see it.

01:05:00.094 --> 01:05:03.031
I'm picking up two more
on your left and right as well.

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.099
Look out. They're moving.

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:12.708
I'm going in for a closer look.

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:14.275
Be careful, Khara.

01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:17.446
Whatever's out there, it's big.

01:05:29.056 --> 01:05:31.393
Skellig, it's a Giant!
It's moving!

01:05:42.036 --> 01:05:45.139
Wydd, stay low,
and stay out of the way.

01:05:45.172 --> 01:05:47.275
Skellig, fire! Keep firing!

01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:48.477
Don't worry about him.

01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:50.312
Worry about the other two
on your flank!

01:05:50.344 --> 01:05:51.346
Got it.

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:57.519
Something must
have been triggered

01:05:57.552 --> 01:05:59.722
when Nascien
accessed the system.

01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:03.025
Anything else you forgot to tell us?

01:06:03.057 --> 01:06:05.661
These Giants have a weakness.
They're not like us.

01:06:05.693 --> 01:06:09.597
They require physical connection
to the... to their network

01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:12.433
in order to identify
and attack an intruder.

01:06:12.467 --> 01:06:15.471
Cut the connection, and that
should stop those Giants.

01:06:15.503 --> 01:06:17.139
Skellig, did you get that?

01:06:17.172 --> 01:06:20.141
Loud and clear.
Cut the cable, kill the Giants.

01:06:20.175 --> 01:06:22.111
Skellig, you keep them distracted.

01:06:22.143 --> 01:06:23.346
I'll find the cables.

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:00.249
Anytime now, Khara!

01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:04.586
Found it!

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:17.398
That's one down, Khara.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.336
Be a decoy, and flank the Giant!

01:07:47.695 --> 01:07:49.697
Nice shooting, Skellig.

01:07:49.731 --> 01:07:52.401
Khara, can you hear me?

01:07:52.434 --> 01:07:53.435
Wydd, go ahead.

01:07:53.467 --> 01:07:55.436
We found an access point.

01:07:55.469 --> 01:07:57.805
Nascien's going to try
to disable the defense system,

01:07:57.838 --> 01:07:59.273
but it will take time.

01:07:59.306 --> 01:08:02.610
Can you keep
the remaining Giants distracted?

01:08:04.311 --> 01:08:05.815
Just hurry, Wydd.

01:08:08.382 --> 01:08:10.351
I'll take the big one.

01:08:10.385 --> 01:08:11.854
You take the little one.

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:17.091
Big one? Little one?

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:56.532
What happened to "the big one"?

01:08:56.564 --> 01:08:58.899
They're all big ones.

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:34.636
Skellig!

01:09:39.506 --> 01:09:41.210
Skellig, run.

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:42.377
Skellig!

01:10:24.719 --> 01:10:26.421
We've disengaged the system.

01:10:26.453 --> 01:10:27.421
We're safe now.

01:10:27.454 --> 01:10:29.490
Khara, do you read me?

01:10:29.524 --> 01:10:32.494
We've located the position
of the central terminal,

01:10:32.527 --> 01:10:35.264
the core of Dual Grund.

01:10:35.296 --> 01:10:37.298
Nascien will show you the path.

01:10:37.332 --> 01:10:39.901
We have to help Skellig.

01:10:39.934 --> 01:10:42.304
Forget Skellig.

01:10:42.337 --> 01:10:44.740
Nothing could've survived
that explosion.

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:50.578
Khara, if you want to know
the truth, forget Skellig,

01:10:50.612 --> 01:10:53.615
and follow the path
that Nascien reveals.

01:12:11.525 --> 01:12:15.764
You have served me well,
Kumtak.

01:12:15.796 --> 01:12:18.333
Nascien.

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:52.501
I am Malakh,

01:12:52.533 --> 01:12:54.536
messenger of the Gods.

01:12:56.104 --> 01:13:01.810
Nascien is only the shell I wear
when I walk in your world.

01:13:01.842 --> 01:13:05.813
Garm type, Druid, you call it.

01:13:05.846 --> 01:13:11.819
I have come to this place so I
may fulfill my lord's bidding.

01:14:11.045 --> 01:14:13.782
I found you.

01:14:13.814 --> 01:14:15.850
I protected you.

01:14:17.284 --> 01:14:19.121
I killed for you.

01:14:20.721 --> 01:14:22.023
For what?

01:14:25.659 --> 01:14:27.929
Tell me.

01:14:27.962 --> 01:14:30.165
Tell me, what have I done?

01:14:56.323 --> 01:14:57.759
Malakh.

01:15:01.128 --> 01:15:04.265
Speak not my name.

01:15:04.298 --> 01:15:07.101
Listen well, Kumtak.

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:10.105
My name is Wydd,

01:15:10.137 --> 01:15:12.774
Wydd-256.

01:15:12.806 --> 01:15:16.711
Time had stood still for the Garm,

01:15:16.743 --> 01:15:22.716
but by your coming here,
it has begun to flow once more.

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:27.889
The time of the Garms'
extinction has begun.

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:36.163
Your body
will still prove useful to me.

01:15:36.197 --> 01:15:38.967
The braincase of a Kumtak

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.972
will be able to freely access
the central Garm network.

01:15:45.006 --> 01:15:49.010
I shall make free use of it.

01:15:49.042 --> 01:15:52.913
However, all other central memories

01:15:52.947 --> 01:15:55.650
will be deleted from it.

01:15:57.051 --> 01:15:59.654
I am Wydd,

01:15:59.686 --> 01:16:01.789
Wydd...

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.625
256.

01:16:05.059 --> 01:16:07.896
I am Wydd,

01:16:07.929 --> 01:16:10.599
Wydd...

01:16:10.631 --> 01:16:12.934
2-5...

01:16:14.702 --> 01:16:17.338
How peculiar.

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:19.807
It would appear that
the few thoughts

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:22.744
remaining in this body's braincase

01:16:22.777 --> 01:16:26.981
do not wish its memories
of you to be deleted.

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:30.852
I have placed here
a flaming sword,

01:16:30.885 --> 01:16:33.788
which turns every direction

01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:37.891
to guard the way
to the Tree of Life.

01:17:32.113 --> 01:17:34.849
Give it up.
There's no way out.

01:17:34.881 --> 01:17:36.384
You're trapped in there.

01:17:36.417 --> 01:17:39.187
My name is Khara-23.

01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:42.957
Now tell me, why do we fight?

01:17:42.989 --> 01:17:47.394
What meaning does the Garms'
endless fighting have?

01:17:47.427 --> 01:17:48.863
Answer me.

01:17:55.435 --> 01:17:57.838
The owner of this body

01:17:57.872 --> 01:17:59.841
already appears to know the answer.

01:17:59.873 --> 01:18:02.010
Then tell me.

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:53.228
What was is and ever shall be.

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:56.731
I form the light and create darkness.

01:18:59.567 --> 01:19:02.302
When this world was not yet formed,

01:19:02.336 --> 01:19:06.173
They came from far, far away.

01:19:06.207 --> 01:19:09.778
Then They divided this world
into heaven and earth

01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:14.181
and filled the space between
with living things.

01:19:17.051 --> 01:19:19.287
Finally They created the Garm

01:19:19.319 --> 01:19:22.422
and bequeathed unto them
a portion of their technology

01:19:22.456 --> 01:19:26.194
that allowed the Garm
to control this world.

01:19:29.095 --> 01:19:32.900
The Garm were separated
into tribes

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:34.936
according to their abilities.

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:40.240
Eventually they named themselves...

01:19:40.274 --> 01:19:43.912
Briga, Columba, Kumtak.

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:50.284
And they named the individuals
that formed the tribe

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:52.020
and went on to name

01:19:52.052 --> 01:19:54.889
every living thing
that filled this world.

01:19:54.921 --> 01:19:59.893
To name something
is to show dominance over it.

01:19:59.926 --> 01:20:02.429
And when They
were named by the Garm,

01:20:02.462 --> 01:20:05.300
They abandoned the Garm
and left this world.

01:20:06.967 --> 01:20:10.971
They forbade the Garm
the power to create new life,

01:20:11.005 --> 01:20:15.243
for They feared the Garm
and their reckless desire

01:20:15.275 --> 01:20:18.145
to conquer all
that was in their world.

01:20:18.179 --> 01:20:23.417
And since that time,
the Garm have had no future,

01:20:23.451 --> 01:20:26.221
only a present.

01:20:26.253 --> 01:20:31.458
And now the Giants will rise
and burn Annwn to ash.

01:20:34.962 --> 01:20:38.566
What was is and ever shall be.

01:20:38.599 --> 01:20:43.037
I form the light
and create darkness.

01:20:43.069 --> 01:20:44.137
Wait.

01:20:44.171 --> 01:20:46.407
What do you mean,
"Ever shall be"?

01:20:46.439 --> 01:20:49.109
Who are "They,"
and where have They gone?

01:20:50.543 --> 01:20:52.412
They've already begun
their next experiment

01:20:52.445 --> 01:20:54.882
in the place closest to this world.

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:57.652
That's why this world
must be destroyed.

01:20:57.685 --> 01:20:59.921
You keep saying, "They."

01:20:59.953 --> 01:21:02.157
Why don't you say their name?

01:21:03.423 --> 01:21:07.295
Even now, you ask their name.

01:21:08.695 --> 01:21:12.500
They call themselves...

01:21:24.578 --> 01:21:26.981
It means "jealous,"

01:21:27.014 --> 01:21:30.252
for They are a jealous God.

01:23:14.587 --> 01:23:16.490
07-01...

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:17.692
36...

01:23:17.725 --> 01:23:19.594
Message from early warning craft.

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:23.164
Two echelons Danaan
from bearing 01-09...

01:23:23.197 --> 01:23:25.699
-06-03...
-04-07...

01:23:25.733 --> 01:23:27.668
-Three echelons...
-02-07...

01:23:27.701 --> 01:23:30.070
03-02...

01:23:30.104 --> 01:23:32.472
-Prepare to launch...
-Two echelons...

01:23:32.506 --> 01:23:34.175
Number increasing.

01:23:52.225 --> 01:23:55.595
Task force 11 in battle array,
ready to deploy.

01:23:55.628 --> 01:23:57.465
Task force 12 ready to deploy.

01:23:57.497 --> 01:24:01.335
Third formation,
bearing 02-07.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.676
Fifth assault ship force ready.

01:24:14.814 --> 01:24:19.252
-Strike force 103 ready.
-Formation 08-05.

01:24:49.416 --> 01:24:53.788
The invasion by the reawakened Giants

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:58.158
marks the end
of the so-called Old Cycle

01:24:58.192 --> 01:25:02.329
and the dawn
of a new era on planet Annwn,

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:05.133
an era of heavy warfare

01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:09.136
between Garm and Malakh.
