24:51.756 --> 24:53.657
Could we walk and do maths?

24:53.658 --> 24:55.459
I just completed an equation

24:55.460 --> 24:58.762
which seems to be for
predicting planetary alignments.

24:58.763 --> 25:00.064

25:00.065 --> 25:02.032

25:07.739 --> 25:11.175
This set of equations,
the maths in here,

25:11.176 --> 25:13.477
are about predicting where
a small point of a planet

25:13.478 --> 25:14.645
will be and when.

in place and time

Here's longitude.

does this help us?

26:00.325 --> 26:01.426
Yes, well.

26:02.894 --> 26:07.698
I believe the reason this
tunnel system is so unsystematic

26:07.699 --> 26:10.334
rests with it being built to
find this very specific point

us we're underground?

Yes, and they were
digging for something.

I'm sorry.

could draw us a map, could it?

42:39.790 --> 42:41.691
You have to understand
that the schedule has moved.

42:41.692 --> 42:43.493
We cannot slow it down any
more than we can speed it up.

42:43.494 --> 42:45.562
She's not a machine
and neither am I.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.196
This is not some switch
you can simply...

42:47.197 --> 42:50.700
There's no off switch
for what is about to come.

42:50.701 --> 42:51.701
They are fully aware.

42:51.702 --> 42:54.103
Yes, I realize that.

42:54.104 --> 42:56.105
She'll either be ready or not.

42:56.106 --> 42:58.642
There is no other path to take.

43:06.817 --> 43:08.384
I know what's at stake here.

43:08.385 --> 43:09.286

43:17.595 --> 43:18.995

to be prepared.

43:18.996 --> 43:20.530
She could die.

43:20.531 --> 43:24.001
And if we need her
and she is not ready,

43:25.169 --> 43:27.605
she will not be the only one.

43:28.872 --> 43:31.108
You know what's at stake.

43:32.142 --> 43:33.543
She knew what was at stake.

43:33.544 --> 43:35.278
No, she didn't.

43:35.279 --> 43:39.617
Maybe not completely, but
who amongst us fully did?

43:41.752 --> 43:43.286
That's true enough.

43:43.287 --> 43:46.756
And she volunteered
just like the rest of us.

43:46.757 --> 43:48.057
And if she could
tell you now why,

43:48.058 --> 43:50.627
she would probably thank you.

43:50.628 --> 43:51.528
Perhaps.

43:52.563 --> 43:53.831
No, certainly.

Up her dosages in her sessions.

43:56.767 --> 43:58.568
I know you can.

You see it?

43:59.371 --> 44:00.603
What?

44:00.604 --> 44:02.205
How did it get in there?

44:02.206 --> 44:03.640
They suspect.

44:03.641 --> 44:04.642
Do nothing.

44:05.876 --> 44:07.177
Think nothing.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.581
Ah, we were expecting you.

44:11.582 --> 44:14.852

moved as has mine.

44:17.187 --> 44:18.288

44:20.791 --> 44:23.593
Ah, I see you've found
one of Julius' patients.

44:23.594 --> 44:27.131
May I introduce to
you Dr. Julius Hicks.

44:31.635 --> 44:35.738
Number 36 here is part
of an ongoing experiment

44:35.739 --> 44:38.841
that primarily focuses on
behavioral modification.

44:38.842 --> 44:41.712
She was listening to you both

44:42.946 --> 44:45.683
as you talked outside this room.

44:50.621 --> 44:51.889
As she does now.

44:53.957 --> 44:58.494
Well, I don't want to sound
rude, but with this drip,

44:58.495 --> 45:01.264
I doubt that she understands
a word that we're saying.

45:01.265 --> 45:02.965
I'm glad you're here, sir.

45:02.966 --> 45:04.701
We'd like to discuss
the change in schedule

45:04.702 --> 45:07.303
and the dangers involved.

45:07.304 --> 45:09.672
The wheels turn, gentlemen.

45:09.673 --> 45:13.410
And so, we must all
adhere to the schedule

45:14.678 --> 45:17.480
no matter what the dangers.

45:17.481 --> 45:18.848
We waste time here.

45:18.849 --> 45:21.919
We are scientists,
not mechanics.

45:23.187 --> 45:27.156
And no amount of inspections,
or strong-arm tactics,

45:27.157 --> 45:31.462
can make us speed up this
delicate, and important, work.

45:34.965 --> 45:39.368
As men of science, you're
folly is to always place

45:39.369 --> 45:42.272
your own work in
such high regard.

45:45.676 --> 45:49.412
Giddy with self importance,
you scuttle out of the shadows

45:49.413 --> 45:52.715

wondering how did they

45:52.716 --> 45:55.619
ever survive this
long without me.

45:58.889 --> 46:02.960
And yet, when faced with
the real world needs

46:03.927 --> 46:08.065
of your scientific work,
you quibble and forget.

46:12.703 --> 46:13.771
Yes, Doctor.

46:15.939 --> 46:18.407
The real world races towards us

46:18.408 --> 46:21.310
and the changing schedule
is not an idle threat.

such a tight deadline.

Oh, no.

be a bad idea.

still a chance we...

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:10.691
Wrong.

get dragged back down again.

I will never let you go,

It wasn't our fault.

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:29.538
It wasn't our fault.

01:18:35.477 --> 01:18:38.246
We were given
classified material

01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:41.549
collected from all
over the world.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:44.453
Some of it thousands
of years old.

(DISTORTED TALKING)

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:55.129

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:59.434

shall write you into history.

So, now it is the time to focus.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.896
Now it is the time
to do great work.

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:38.305
RICHARD: At first we were
just collecting information

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:40.007
and relaying our findings.

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:41.842
Much of it appeared
to be rubbish.

01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:46.247
Magic, the occult, demons,
fire and brimstone nonsense.

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:48.949
Then, we started to see
patterns in the material

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:51.286
that couldn't be possible.

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:54.755
Equations,
experiments, questions.

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:57.024
They were thousands of
years ahead of their time.

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:58.326
Some even now.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:03.532
And hidden amongst it all
we uncovered instructions.

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:08.936
If any of them start
looking in the wrong place,

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:09.838
kill them.

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:12.606
Of course.

01:20:12.607 --> 01:20:14.441
And the families?

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:16.144
Many have offspring.

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:22.150

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:26.454
Everyone.

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:36.964
RICHARD: We were arrogant, entitled.

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:38.599
And following those instructions

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.036
we ripped a hole in thin air.

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:46.641
We discovered a source of
power impossible, infinite.

01:20:47.976 --> 01:20:50.077
It wasn't just a
source of power.

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:51.812
We couldn't tell,

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:55.282
but something was making us
do these things and forget.

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:56.650
FRANCES: What did they forget?

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:58.687
Forget what, professor?

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:06.660

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:12.934

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:33.388

taking to distance himself.

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:35.223
To observe.

01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:40.562
Kept himself separate to try
to stop what was happening.

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:44.031
