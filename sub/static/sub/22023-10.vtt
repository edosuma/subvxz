WEBVTT

00:00.038 --> 00:02.009
To assist with housekeeping.

00:02.039 --> 00:04.584
We switched the isle six endcap

00:04.614 --> 00:05.968
so don't be alarmed.

00:05.998 --> 00:08.071
The softball team will once again

00:08.102 --> 00:10.737
not be happening and...

00:11.365 --> 00:12.676
Last thing, ah...

00:12.706 --> 00:16.714
We got word that Jerusha has
an abnormally shaped uterus

00:16.744 --> 00:18.969
which will prevent her
from getting pregnant.

00:18.999 --> 00:21.314
So if any of you know any women

00:21.347 --> 00:25.343
who might like to carry our
baby, you know, let me know.

00:25.742 --> 00:27.603
Any questions about softball?

00:29.190 --> 00:31.471
Okay then, well, Jeff,
the floor is yours.

00:31.501 --> 00:33.064
Yeah, thank you.

00:35.708 --> 00:37.535
Thank you for that warm reception.

00:37.565 --> 00:39.199
I mean, you're here a lot.

00:39.229 --> 00:40.704
True. Today's not about me, though.

00:40.734 --> 00:42.206
It's about something big.

00:42.236 --> 00:43.537
Bigger than all of us.

00:43.567 --> 00:44.460
Is it your forehead?

00:44.490 --> 00:46.379
No. Hi, Mateo.

00:46.409 --> 00:48.179
Um, sales are up this quarter.

00:48.209 --> 00:51.277
We are within $80,000
of reclassification.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.117
If we can make that
by the end of the day,

00:53.147 --> 00:56.716
we will go from being
a triple-A store to a...

00:58.322 --> 01:00.128
- See where I'm going?
- No.

01:00.158 --> 01:02.693
Reclassified as a...

01:02.861 --> 01:04.800
Nobody's following you. Just finish.

01:04.830 --> 01:08.699
Quadruple-A, guys.
We're gonna be a Quad-A store.

01:08.790 --> 01:11.030
We're gonna be a high volume store.

01:11.060 --> 01:13.328
Whoo! Huh?

01:13.567 --> 01:15.602
Any questions? Garrett.

01:15.636 --> 01:17.403
Abnormally shaped how?

01:17.438 --> 01:20.211
Oh, okay, well, if a woman's
uterus is normally shaped

01:20.241 --> 01:23.476
like a V, Jerusha's is
kinda like a corkscrew.

01:23.510 --> 01:26.145
Kinda like a duck's.
Wait, I'll... I'll draw it.

01:26.180 --> 01:28.184
I meant questions
about the reclassification.

01:28.214 --> 01:29.253
What are we now?

01:29.283 --> 01:31.884
Well, we're triple-A. I just said that.

01:31.919 --> 01:34.220
So this would be one more A then?

01:34.255 --> 01:35.188
Exactly.

01:35.222 --> 01:37.207
Believe me, you guys
are gonna love this.

01:37.237 --> 01:39.125
So do we get anything or...

01:39.155 --> 01:40.297
Yes, you get a sense of pride,

01:40.327 --> 01:41.933
a sense of accomplishment.

01:41.963 --> 01:43.934
Quad-A stores are the first
to feature new products.

01:43.964 --> 01:45.569
Once they take our cafeteria

01:45.599 --> 01:47.304
and transfer it into a
Pizza Hut, there's gonna be...

01:47.334 --> 01:49.432
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you just say Pizza Hut?

01:49.462 --> 01:50.712
Yeah.

01:53.007 --> 01:54.869
Like we're famous or something?

01:54.899 --> 01:57.065
Uh, a point of clarification, Jeff,

01:57.095 --> 01:58.978
would it have the soda too?

01:59.980 --> 02:02.115
Yeah, I believe so.

02:02.149 --> 02:03.583
Oh!

02:03.617 --> 02:07.453
That's a formal Pizza Hut.

02:07.488 --> 02:08.554
There she is.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.500 --> 02:20.933
Give me the marker

02:20.968 --> 02:23.040
'cause someone just made
a thousand dollar sale.

02:23.070 --> 02:24.341
- It was Brett.
- I know.

02:24.371 --> 02:26.010
I just like filling in the thermometer.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.044
It's very satisfying.

02:27.074 --> 02:28.550
Is Pizza Hut that great?

02:28.580 --> 02:30.948
When you've been here long
enough, any change is amazing.

02:30.978 --> 02:32.983
Plus, it's like,
Where do you work? Cloud 9.

02:33.013 --> 02:34.314
The regular one?

02:34.348 --> 02:36.120
Uh, no, the one with the Pizza Hut.

02:36.150 --> 02:39.133
It just... it seems odd that
Jeff waited until today

02:39.163 --> 02:40.495
to tell us about all this.

02:40.525 --> 02:42.102
And he was selling it so hard.

02:42.132 --> 02:43.627
"Believe me, you're gonna love it."

02:43.657 --> 02:45.029
That's what my dad said

02:45.059 --> 02:46.374
before he moved out
and got his own place.

02:46.404 --> 02:48.398
Oh, boo-hoo, poor Jonah.

02:48.428 --> 02:49.900
Both of his parents were homeowners.

02:49.930 --> 02:51.040
What a tragedy.

02:51.070 --> 02:52.636
Actually, it was his friend's condo.

02:52.666 --> 02:53.971
That's not gonna help.

02:54.001 --> 02:55.186
You're just looking for problems.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.864
Maybe, but there's
a Quad-A in Crestwood.

02:57.894 --> 02:59.846
We could go over there at lunch.

02:59.876 --> 03:02.241
Check it out, maybe. Just to be safe.

03:02.276 --> 03:03.671
I mean, it's not the worst idea.

03:03.701 --> 03:08.701
Hey, keep your eye on the prize, okay?

03:08.849 --> 03:10.817
- That's a good point.
- Is it?

03:10.851 --> 03:13.490
You know, I honestly didn't
know how many candidates

03:13.520 --> 03:15.474
we'd get from a Craigslist ad, but...

03:15.504 --> 03:17.506
Wonderful things can happen
in all sorts of ways.

03:17.536 --> 03:18.628
I agree.

03:19.285 --> 03:22.199
But you did see the part where
we said we couldn't afford

03:22.229 --> 03:24.001
the going rate for surrogates?

03:24.031 --> 03:28.167
I mean, I know the agencies say
it could be as much as $50,000.

03:28.202 --> 03:29.666
But we've only saved 20.

03:29.696 --> 03:31.738
Oh, 20's more than enough.

03:32.322 --> 03:33.153
Oh.

03:34.041 --> 03:36.175
Of which we can only give you 15.

03:36.210 --> 03:37.543
It's not a problem.

03:37.578 --> 03:39.416
- Sorry, I meant ten.
- That's low, so...

03:39.446 --> 03:42.014
Okay, no, 15, 15, 15. We agree on 15.

03:42.049 --> 03:43.771
- Great.
- Okay.

03:43.801 --> 03:45.637
You should go with this one.

03:45.667 --> 03:46.741
It's 4K.

03:46.866 --> 03:48.802
What does 4K mean?

03:48.837 --> 03:50.587
Oh, um,

03:52.106 --> 03:54.854
The first K is "knowledge."

03:56.010 --> 03:57.847
And then the second K...

03:57.877 --> 04:00.547
4K televisions have 8.3 megapixels.

04:00.582 --> 04:02.819
The human eye is literally incapable

04:02.849 --> 04:05.037
of appreciating a
finer resolution than this.

04:05.067 --> 04:07.354
Wow. Okay, I'll take it.

04:09.924 --> 04:11.822
- There you go.
- Thank you.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.060

04:18.120 --> 04:20.473
this is your American

04:20.503 --> 04:21.267
Yep.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.041
And you don't have an ID with you.

04:23.071 --> 04:24.738
Left it at the office.

04:24.772 --> 04:28.617
You'd like to purchase an
Xbox One and a pile of candy.

04:28.743 --> 04:30.248
Yeah, you know, for the kids.

04:30.278 --> 04:31.952
What kinda business you in?

04:32.413 --> 04:33.862
Oil and gas.

04:35.272 --> 04:36.493
Oh, you know if it was me,

04:36.523 --> 04:38.778
I might pick up a second
Xbox to have one upstairs,

04:38.808 --> 04:40.656
- have one downstairs.
- Okay.

Hey, now let's talk dancers.

05:00.823 --> 05:03.272
How many are we talking?
And... all dudes?

05:04.038 --> 05:05.338
Maybe no dancers.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.278
Music and balloons with no dancers?

05:07.308 --> 05:10.076
That's... gonna look insane, but fine.

05:10.111 --> 05:13.079
Jeff. Uh, new hat?

05:13.114 --> 05:14.614
Yeah. I splurged.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.254
You know, it's a huge day.
It's a very huge day.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.190
Definitely. Um, we were wondering

05:19.220 --> 05:21.625
if you could maybe
tell us a little bit more

05:21.655 --> 05:24.858
about what we can expect
once this store becomes Quad-A.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.260
Oh, uh, well, yeah, I mean,

05:27.294 --> 05:29.233
things are pretty much
gonna be the same.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.429
Well, but earlier you said
it would be better.

05:31.459 --> 05:33.400
Yes, obviously better.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.735
- Better and the same.
- Nice.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.173
That sounds amazing.

05:37.203 --> 05:38.304
Right.

05:38.339 --> 05:42.208
Is there any possibility
that it could maybe get worse?

05:42.243 --> 05:45.308
You know what, there's a lot
of liars out there, okay?

05:45.338 --> 05:47.777
Look for people who
have scores to settle, perhaps.

05:47.807 --> 05:49.720
And don't believe everything you hear.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.551
What would we have heard?

05:51.585 --> 05:53.230
Oh, I don't know, but whatever it is,

05:53.260 --> 05:54.486
it would've been untrue.

05:54.516 --> 05:56.389
That's why it's a paradox.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.994
Believe me. It's gonna be great.

06:01.162 --> 06:02.081
Trust me.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.620
Man, I can't wait for it to be great.

06:08.269 --> 06:10.069
So, what's next?

06:10.104 --> 06:12.076
You write me a check
and I can have a baby for you

06:12.106 --> 06:13.606
in as little as a week.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.247
- A week?
- Oh, is that too long?

06:16.277 --> 06:17.557
I mean, if you're really impatient,

06:17.587 --> 06:18.672
I can get you one earlier,

06:18.702 --> 06:21.202
but you're not gonna
get to choose the color.

06:23.074 --> 06:24.969
Turns out that when
you can't pay top dollar,

06:24.999 --> 06:27.768
the surrogates you get
are just a bunch of plops.

06:28.259 --> 06:30.136
Aw, I'm sure you'll find someone.

06:30.166 --> 06:31.129
I don't know.

06:31.159 --> 06:33.707
Sometimes I think
that maybe God is trying

06:33.737 --> 06:36.536
to send me a message that
people in their late 50s

06:36.566 --> 06:38.241
shouldn't conceive a child.

06:38.674 --> 06:40.224
That's crazy talk.

Of course, I would.

Let's relax. It was a crappy store.

18:32.377 --> 18:33.660
Yeah, fair enough.

18:33.845 --> 18:35.389
It'll be fine, you guys.

18:35.747 --> 18:37.269
We'll clean as we go.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.409
We'll clean as we go.

18:41.553 --> 18:44.055
How do you get money
stains off your hands?

18:44.089 --> 18:45.394
What're you talking about?

18:45.424 --> 18:47.029
You know how when you handle money,

18:47.059 --> 18:49.126
the ink comes off on your hands?

18:51.668 --> 18:52.634
Another counterfeit.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.736
But I used the pen thingy
and it was yellow.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.370
Yeah, that means fake. You want brown.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.407
I thought it was,
If it's yellow, let it mellow.

18:58.437 --> 18:59.574
Wait, no, that's piss.

18:59.604 --> 19:01.706
There are so many of these.

19:01.740 --> 19:02.840
Where we at?

19:05.243 --> 19:07.344
We're not Quad-A. We did it!

19:08.780 --> 19:13.084
- Alright!
- You tiny little fool.

19:13.118 --> 19:16.387
We're not number one.
We're not nu... no.

19:16.421 --> 19:18.089
It doesn't work as well.

19:18.123 --> 19:21.225
I guess it was when Mateo
dumped me, you know, I just...

19:21.259 --> 19:22.698
I just dove into my work,

19:22.728 --> 19:24.700
'cause I thought that would
be fulfilling, but...

19:24.730 --> 19:27.598
So here I am, on the cusp of
having a Quad-A store

19:27.632 --> 19:31.335
and it's like, I don't even
know if I want that, you know?

19:31.369 --> 19:34.004
Oh, actually, we didn't make Quad-A.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.606
What? Dammit.

19:35.640 --> 19:39.243
- Oh, no, it's gonna be...
- No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:39.277 --> 19:42.012
This is bad. I can't go home, Jonah.

19:42.047 --> 19:44.515
I'm [bleep]. I'm [bleep].

19:44.549 --> 19:47.451
I bought a Subaru! That money's gone!

19:47.486 --> 19:49.191
Gone. I couldn't wait a week?

19:49.221 --> 19:51.856
One week. No discipline.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.524
[bleep]!

19:54.559 --> 19:56.193
- Hey, Glenn.
- Mm.

19:56.223 --> 19:57.966
Just wanted to let you know
we didn't make the target.

19:57.996 --> 19:59.322
No Quad-A.

19:59.352 --> 20:00.629
Oh, okay.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.201
- You all right?
- Hmm?

20:04.236 --> 20:05.576
Yeah, I'll be fine.

20:06.471 --> 20:09.140
I was so close to having a baby.

20:09.174 --> 20:09.959
But...

20:10.842 --> 20:12.710
You wanna be my surrogate?

20:12.744 --> 20:14.416
The idea of carrying your child

20:14.446 --> 20:16.151
makes me wanna put
a bullet through my uterus.

20:16.181 --> 20:17.782
I was joking.

20:17.812 --> 20:19.321
I wouldn't want you to carry my baby

20:19.351 --> 20:21.379
if you paid me the $20,000.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.455
Wait, you're paying $20,000?

20:24.489 --> 20:26.661
Just for someone to squirt out your kid?

20:26.691 --> 20:28.507
Well, yeah, a little bit more.

20:29.094 --> 20:32.496
I mean, that's practically
what I take home in a year.

20:32.531 --> 20:36.133
I could fix up my house.
Pay off my credit card bills.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.974
I could put my mom away
for good with money like that.

20:39.004 --> 20:40.182
Well, I mean...

20:41.439 --> 20:44.642
If that's something you wanted,
I could think about it.

20:44.676 --> 20:47.311
I mean, if <i>you were interested</i>

20:47.345 --> 20:49.847
then <i>I</i> would think about it.

20:49.881 --> 20:54.285
- It's not something I want.
- Oh, I would want it far less.

21:02.394 --> 21:04.028
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.362
This is cool.

21:05.397 --> 21:06.701
You know, I've always wanted

21:06.731 --> 21:08.370
to have a family of my own someday,

21:08.400 --> 21:09.538
so it'll be great
to have a practice baby

21:09.568 --> 21:11.006
where nothing matters.

21:11.036 --> 21:13.056
- Wait, wait...
- Like, whatever happens to it

21:13.086 --> 21:15.506
happens to it, you know?
