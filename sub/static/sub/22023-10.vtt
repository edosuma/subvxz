WEBVTT

00:00.038 --> 00:02.009
To assist with housekeeping.

00:02.039 --> 00:04.584
We switched the isle six endcap

00:04.614 --> 00:05.968
so don't be alarmed.

00:05.998 --> 00:08.071
The softball team will once again

00:08.102 --> 00:10.737
not be happening and...

00:11.365 --> 00:12.676
Last thing, ah...

00:12.706 --> 00:16.714
We got word that Jerusha has
an abnormally shaped uterus

00:16.744 --> 00:18.969
which will prevent her
from getting pregnant.

00:18.999 --> 00:21.314
So if any of you know any women

00:21.347 --> 00:25.343
who might like to carry our
baby, you know, let me know.

00:25.742 --> 00:27.603
Any questions about softball?

00:29.190 --> 00:31.471
Okay then, well, Jeff,
the floor is yours.

00:31.501 --> 00:33.064
Yeah, thank you.

00:35.708 --> 00:37.535
Thank you for that warm reception.

00:37.565 --> 00:39.199
I mean, you're here a lot.

00:39.229 --> 00:40.704
True. Today's not about me, though.

00:40.734 --> 00:42.206
It's about something big.

00:42.236 --> 00:43.537
Bigger than all of us.

00:43.567 --> 00:44.460
Is it your forehead?

00:44.490 --> 00:46.379
No. Hi, Mateo.

00:46.409 --> 00:48.179
Um, sales are up this quarter.

00:48.209 --> 00:51.277
We are within $80,000
of reclassification.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.117
If we can make that
by the end of the day,

00:53.147 --> 00:56.716
we will go from being
a triple-A store to a...

00:58.322 --> 01:00.128
- See where I'm going?
- No.

01:00.158 --> 01:02.693
Reclassified as a...

01:02.861 --> 01:04.800
Nobody's following you. Just finish.

01:04.830 --> 01:08.699
Quadruple-A, guys.
We're gonna be a Quad-A store.

01:08.790 --> 01:11.030
We're gonna be a high volume store.

01:11.060 --> 01:13.328
Whoo! Huh?

01:13.567 --> 01:15.602
Any questions? Garrett.

01:15.636 --> 01:17.403
Abnormally shaped how?

01:17.438 --> 01:20.211
Oh, okay, well, if a woman's
uterus is normally shaped

01:20.241 --> 01:23.476
like a V, Jerusha's is
kinda like a corkscrew.

01:23.510 --> 01:26.145
Kinda like a duck's.
Wait, I'll... I'll draw it.

01:26.180 --> 01:28.184
I meant questions
about the reclassification.

01:28.214 --> 01:29.253
What are we now?

01:29.283 --> 01:31.884
Well, we're triple-A. I just said that.

01:31.919 --> 01:34.220
So this would be one more A then?

01:34.255 --> 01:35.188
Exactly.

01:35.222 --> 01:37.207
Believe me, you guys
are gonna love this.

01:37.237 --> 01:39.125
So do we get anything or...

01:39.155 --> 01:40.297
Yes, you get a sense of pride,

01:40.327 --> 01:41.933
a sense of accomplishment.

01:41.963 --> 01:43.934
Quad-A stores are the first
to feature new products.

01:43.964 --> 01:45.569
Once they take our cafeteria

01:45.599 --> 01:47.304
and transfer it into a
Pizza Hut, there's gonna be...

01:47.334 --> 01:49.432
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you just say Pizza Hut?

01:49.462 --> 01:50.712
Yeah.

01:53.007 --> 01:54.869
Like we're famous or something?

01:54.899 --> 01:57.065
Uh, a point of clarification, Jeff,

01:57.095 --> 01:58.978
would it have the soda too?

01:59.980 --> 02:02.115
Yeah, I believe so.

02:02.149 --> 02:03.583
Oh!

02:03.617 --> 02:07.453
That's a formal Pizza Hut.

02:07.488 --> 02:08.554
There she is.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.500 --> 02:20.933
Give me the marker

02:20.968 --> 02:23.040
'cause someone just made
a thousand dollar sale.

02:23.070 --> 02:24.341
- It was Brett.
- I know.

02:24.371 --> 02:26.010
I just like filling in the thermometer.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.044
It's very satisfying.

02:27.074 --> 02:28.550
Is Pizza Hut that great?

02:28.580 --> 02:30.948
When you've been here long
enough, any change is amazing.

02:30.978 --> 02:32.983
Plus, it's like,
Where do you work? Cloud 9.

02:33.013 --> 02:34.314
The regular one?

02:34.348 --> 02:36.120
Uh, no, the one with the Pizza Hut.

02:36.150 --> 02:39.133
It just... it seems odd that
Jeff waited until today

02:39.163 --> 02:40.495
to tell us about all this.

02:40.525 --> 02:42.102
And he was selling it so hard.

02:42.132 --> 02:43.627
"Believe me, you're gonna love it."

02:43.657 --> 02:45.029
That's what my dad said

02:45.059 --> 02:46.374
before he moved out
and got his own place.

02:46.404 --> 02:48.398
Oh, boo-hoo, poor Jonah.

02:48.428 --> 02:49.900
Both of his parents were homeowners.

02:49.930 --> 02:51.040
What a tragedy.

02:51.070 --> 02:52.636
Actually, it was his friend's condo.

02:52.666 --> 02:53.971
That's not gonna help.

02:54.001 --> 02:55.186
You're just looking for problems.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.864
Maybe, but there's
a Quad-A in Crestwood.

02:57.894 --> 02:59.846
We could go over there at lunch.

02:59.876 --> 03:02.241
Check it out, maybe. Just to be safe.

03:02.276 --> 03:03.671
I mean, it's not the worst idea.

03:03.701 --> 03:08.701
Hey, keep your eye on the prize, okay?

03:08.849 --> 03:10.817
- That's a good point.
- Is it?

03:10.851 --> 03:13.490
You know, I honestly didn't
know how many candidates

03:13.520 --> 03:15.474
we'd get from a Craigslist ad, but...

03:15.504 --> 03:17.506
Wonderful things can happen
in all sorts of ways.

03:17.536 --> 03:18.628
I agree.

03:19.285 --> 03:22.199
But you did see the part where
we said we couldn't afford

03:22.229 --> 03:24.001
the going rate for surrogates?

03:24.031 --> 03:28.167
I mean, I know the agencies say
it could be as much as $50,000.

03:28.202 --> 03:29.666
But we've only saved 20.

03:29.696 --> 03:31.738
Oh, 20's more than enough.

03:32.322 --> 03:33.153
Oh.

03:34.041 --> 03:36.175
Of which we can only give you 15.

03:36.210 --> 03:37.543
It's not a problem.

03:37.578 --> 03:39.416
- Sorry, I meant ten.
- That's low, so...

03:39.446 --> 03:42.014
Okay, no, 15, 15, 15. We agree on 15.

03:42.049 --> 03:43.771
- Great.
- Okay.

03:43.801 --> 03:45.637
You should go with this one.

03:45.667 --> 03:46.741
It's 4K.

03:46.866 --> 03:48.802
What does 4K mean?

03:48.837 --> 03:50.587
Oh, um,

03:52.106 --> 03:54.854
The first K is "knowledge."

03:56.010 --> 03:57.847
And then the second K...

03:57.877 --> 04:00.547
4K televisions have 8.3 megapixels.

04:00.582 --> 04:02.819
The human eye is literally incapable

04:02.849 --> 04:05.037
of appreciating a
finer resolution than this.

04:05.067 --> 04:07.354
Wow. Okay, I'll take it.

04:09.924 --> 04:11.822
- There you go.
- Thank you.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.060
It has all of the channels.

04:16.029 --> 04:18.091
Okay, so Charles Marquard,

04:18.120 --> 04:20.473
this is your American
Express Business card.

04:20.503 --> 04:21.267
Yep.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.041
And you don't have an ID with you.

04:23.071 --> 04:24.738
Left it at the office.

04:24.772 --> 04:28.617
You'd like to purchase an
Xbox One and a pile of candy.

04:28.743 --> 04:30.248
Yeah, you know, for the kids.

04:30.278 --> 04:31.952
What kinda business you in?

04:32.413 --> 04:33.862
Oil and gas.

04:35.272 --> 04:36.493
Oh, you know if it was me,

04:36.523 --> 04:38.778
I might pick up a second
Xbox to have one upstairs,

04:38.808 --> 04:40.656
- have one downstairs.
- Okay.

04:40.978 --> 04:42.870
You're a good dad, Mr. Marquard.

04:47.455 --> 04:52.152
<i>â™ª</i>

04:52.182 --> 04:55.140
Okay, as soon as we hit
$80,000, drop the balloons,

04:55.170 --> 04:57.070
hit the music, get a
candid picture of me

04:57.100 --> 04:58.515
celebrating with everybody
to send to corporate.

04:58.545 --> 05:00.793
Got it, got it.
Hey, now let's talk dancers.

05:00.823 --> 05:03.272
How many are we talking?
And... all dudes?

05:04.038 --> 05:05.338
Maybe no dancers.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.278
Music and balloons with no dancers?

05:07.308 --> 05:10.076
That's... gonna look insane, but fine.

05:10.111 --> 05:13.079
Jeff. Uh, new hat?

05:13.114 --> 05:14.614
Yeah. I splurged.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.254
You know, it's a huge day.
It's a very huge day.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.190
Definitely. Um, we were wondering

05:19.220 --> 05:21.625
if you could maybe
tell us a little bit more

05:21.655 --> 05:24.858
about what we can expect
once this store becomes Quad-A.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.260
Oh, uh, well, yeah, I mean,

05:27.294 --> 05:29.233
things are pretty much
gonna be the same.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.429
Well, but earlier you said
it would be better.

05:31.459 --> 05:33.400
Yes, obviously better.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.735
- Better and the same.
- Nice.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.173
That sounds amazing.

05:37.203 --> 05:38.304
Right.

05:38.339 --> 05:42.208
Is there any possibility
that it could maybe get worse?

05:42.243 --> 05:45.308
You know what, there's a lot
of liars out there, okay?

05:45.338 --> 05:47.777
Look for people who
have scores to settle, perhaps.

05:47.807 --> 05:49.720
And don't believe everything you hear.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.551
What would we have heard?

05:51.585 --> 05:53.230
Oh, I don't know, but whatever it is,

05:53.260 --> 05:54.486
it would've been untrue.

05:54.516 --> 05:56.389
That's why it's a paradox.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.994
Believe me. It's gonna be great.

06:01.162 --> 06:02.081
Trust me.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.620
Man, I can't wait for it to be great.

06:08.269 --> 06:10.069
So, what's next?

06:10.104 --> 06:12.076
You write me a check
and I can have a baby for you

06:12.106 --> 06:13.606
in as little as a week.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.247
- A week?
- Oh, is that too long?

06:16.277 --> 06:17.557
I mean, if you're really impatient,

06:17.587 --> 06:18.672
I can get you one earlier,

06:18.702 --> 06:21.202
but you're not gonna
get to choose the color.

06:23.074 --> 06:24.969
Turns out that when
you can't pay top dollar,

06:24.999 --> 06:27.768
the surrogates you get
are just a bunch of plops.

06:28.259 --> 06:30.136
Aw, I'm sure you'll find someone.

06:30.166 --> 06:31.129
I don't know.

06:31.159 --> 06:33.707
Sometimes I think
that maybe God is trying

06:33.737 --> 06:36.536
to send me a message that
people in their late 50s

06:36.566 --> 06:38.241
shouldn't conceive a child.

06:38.674 --> 06:40.224
That's crazy talk.

06:40.254 --> 06:42.508
You guys are gonna have a killer baby.

06:42.813 --> 06:44.202
Everyone's gonna wanna carry it.

06:44.232 --> 06:46.202
Yeah, right. Would you?

06:46.579 --> 06:48.046
Of course, I would.

06:49.786 --> 06:51.667
Really? You mean that?

06:51.697 --> 06:54.199
Absolutely.

06:56.054 --> 06:58.456
Thank you! Oh, my God.

06:59.825 --> 07:04.295
Jerusha, this is a blessed day.
I found her.

07:04.329 --> 07:05.997
<i>â™ª</i>

07:07.683 --> 07:10.083
Wow, it is busy here.

07:10.118 --> 07:11.819
Is it always like this?

07:11.853 --> 07:16.290
Welcome to the show, people.
Welcome to the show.

07:16.324 --> 07:18.096
Excuse me, hi, sorry to interrupt.

07:18.126 --> 07:19.964
Uh, can I ask you a question? Oh, sure.

07:19.994 --> 07:21.962
Do you like working here?

07:21.996 --> 07:23.797
I love working here.

07:23.832 --> 07:25.336
It's the best job I've ever had.

07:25.366 --> 07:27.439
- Great. Thank you.
- Have a heavenly day.

07:27.469 --> 07:30.337
All right. See? Best job she's ever had?

07:30.371 --> 07:32.844
Where I come from, something
being the best thing

07:32.874 --> 07:34.345
usually means it's pretty good.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.577
Oh, hey, sorry, just out of curiosity,

07:36.611 --> 07:40.514
what's, uh, what's the
worst part of your job?

07:40.548 --> 07:43.350
No part. It's wonderful.

07:43.384 --> 07:45.089
It's the best job I've ever had.

07:45.119 --> 07:46.920
Have a heavenly day.

07:46.950 --> 07:48.193
Did you hear that? That was...

07:48.223 --> 07:49.694
That was two "best job I ever hads"

07:49.724 --> 07:52.030
It's a colloquialism.
Like, "It is what it is."

07:52.060 --> 07:53.264
Or, "Women be shopping."

07:53.294 --> 07:55.095
Excuse me. Hi.

07:55.129 --> 07:56.868
Um, how long have you been working here?

07:56.898 --> 07:59.170
Well, it's been
the best job I've ever had

07:59.200 --> 08:01.168
for about 4 1/2 years.

08:01.202 --> 08:03.103
Best job I've ever had.

08:03.137 --> 08:05.372
Have a heavenly day.

08:05.406 --> 08:08.141
People love it here. Obviously.

08:13.848 --> 08:14.815
Ah!

08:14.849 --> 08:16.450
Oh, sorry about that.

08:16.484 --> 08:20.988
Jerusha is making embroidery of
your face on a rabbit's body.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.494
- Mm.
- To say thank you.

08:22.524 --> 08:24.562
You know, and she wanted
something she could work with.

08:24.592 --> 08:27.060
Could you profile?

08:27.095 --> 08:29.563
- So Jerusha's on board?
- Yeah.

08:29.597 --> 08:34.134
It just means so much to us
that you're willing to do this.

08:34.168 --> 08:36.003
Means so much to me.

08:36.519 --> 08:40.178
So she doesn't think that I'm,
you know, too young,

08:40.207 --> 08:43.038
or irresponsible? Or stupid?

08:43.068 --> 08:43.710
No.

08:43.745 --> 08:46.417
'Cause, you know, if you guys
wanted to go with someone else,

08:46.447 --> 08:48.715
I... I wouldn't be offended.

08:49.684 --> 08:52.252
Cheyenne, do you still wanna do this?

08:52.287 --> 08:53.537
Oh...

08:53.955 --> 08:57.157
Yes. Definitely.

08:57.191 --> 08:58.725
- Totally.
- Great.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.028
You just, you know, try and stop me.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.062
I won't.

09:04.399 --> 09:06.567
Yeah. The thing is...

09:06.601 --> 09:09.870
- Um...
- Ah, is it Bo?

09:11.105 --> 09:14.441
Mm-hmm, yeah. It's Bo.

09:14.475 --> 09:16.281
If it were up to me, I would just say,

09:16.311 --> 09:19.046
You put a baby in me right now, mister.

09:19.080 --> 09:23.784
But Bo, he just sucks, you know.

09:23.818 --> 09:27.318
Yeah. Bo sucks.

09:35.296 --> 09:39.533
Uh, hey, Len. I'm... I'm Jonah.

09:39.567 --> 09:41.468
How's it going today?

09:41.502 --> 09:44.602
Are you okay?

09:44.839 --> 09:46.473
Mm-hmm.

09:46.507 --> 09:49.376
Oh, she's fine. She does this every day.

09:51.913 --> 09:53.146
Nothing.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.452
You guys aren't supposed
to be back here.

09:54.482 --> 09:55.816
Relax, we're legit.

09:55.850 --> 09:58.514
We work at the Ozark Highlands store.

09:58.544 --> 09:59.849
And we're about to go Quad-A,

09:59.879 --> 10:01.492
so we just wanted to see
what that was like.

10:01.522 --> 10:04.091
They're quaddin' ya, huh?

10:04.125 --> 10:05.892
Yeah. They're quadding us.

10:05.927 --> 10:08.428
So, um, what's it like?

10:08.463 --> 10:10.797
Be straight with me. Polo to polo.

10:10.832 --> 10:13.767
Honestly, you're screwed.

10:15.103 --> 10:17.471
We cannot become a Quad-A.

10:17.505 --> 10:19.777
- I don't understand.
- It's total chaos.

10:19.807 --> 10:21.746
Everyday there is like Black Friday.

10:21.776 --> 10:23.514
- It's hell.
- Hell on steroids.

10:23.544 --> 10:26.146
Isn't hell bad enough
without adding steroids?

10:26.180 --> 10:28.849
Everyone there
is exhausted all the time.

10:28.883 --> 10:30.517
They are open 24 hours.

10:30.551 --> 10:32.578
Which means they never
have a chance to catch up.

10:32.608 --> 10:33.995
So when do they have time to clean?

10:34.025 --> 10:37.933
No, guys, we've come too far.
We are this close to Quad-A.

10:37.963 --> 10:38.696
Now is not the time to...

10:38.726 --> 10:40.331
They don't let employees eat the pizza.

10:40.361 --> 10:42.462
- Withdrawn.
- So what do we do?

10:42.497 --> 10:44.197
We need to slow down sales.

10:44.232 --> 10:46.595
Guys, when do they have time to clean?

10:46.625 --> 10:47.538
They don't.

10:47.568 --> 10:49.344
Well, then it never gets clean.

10:49.374 --> 10:50.642
All right, you heard Amy, guys,

10:50.672 --> 10:53.707
let's cross that finish line
and become Quad-A.

10:53.741 --> 10:55.213
Marcus, were you even listening?

10:55.243 --> 10:57.544
Sorry, I got a text earlier.

10:57.578 --> 11:00.218
Honestly, I missed a lot of
what you guys were saying.

11:00.248 --> 11:03.550
â™ª Jah at the controller,
Bua bua bua yeah â™ª

11:03.584 --> 11:05.886
â™ª Wha gwan rasta Control the simma â™ª

11:05.920 --> 11:08.522
- Bo?
- Oh, yo, what up, spouse?

11:08.743 --> 11:11.003
What're you doing here?
Where's Harmonica?

11:11.033 --> 11:12.723
Ah, she's at the zoo. She's good.

11:12.753 --> 11:15.454
Oh, good. Bo's here.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.565
So, why don't we all go
have a chat, you know, and...

11:18.599 --> 11:20.405
see if we can't change your mind?

11:20.435 --> 11:21.873
- Yeah, let's do this.
- Okay.

11:21.903 --> 11:23.241
What're we gonna change my mind about?

11:23.271 --> 11:25.539
- I think you know.
- Huh?

11:25.573 --> 11:28.942
- I think I know?
- You think you know.

11:30.046 --> 11:32.609
Yeah, I called you, and I was like,

11:33.008 --> 11:35.065
"Please, Bo, let me have Glenn's baby."

11:35.095 --> 11:38.305
And you were like, "Nah, girl,
no way, no how, okay?"

11:38.335 --> 11:39.968
Squash that noise. Peace."

11:39.998 --> 11:41.953
Wow, that's crazy, 'cause,
like, the way I remember it,

11:41.983 --> 11:43.657
that never happened at all.

11:43.785 --> 11:45.888
It's funny how perception is,
you know what I'm sayin'?

11:45.918 --> 11:49.485
Bo, is there anything
that Cheyenne and I can say

11:49.515 --> 11:51.356
to help you change your mind?

11:51.717 --> 11:53.151
Mm, I don't know.

11:53.271 --> 11:55.815
It's like, I wanna be
sex-positive, but, like,

11:55.863 --> 11:57.668
on the other side of the hand,

11:57.760 --> 11:59.782
thinking about my wife
banging an old couple...

11:59.812 --> 12:01.002
No, no, no!

12:01.032 --> 12:02.680
And would I get to go with Jerusha?

12:02.710 --> 12:04.475
Almost definitely not.

12:04.818 --> 12:07.229
Well, I really wanna do this for Glenn.

12:07.259 --> 12:08.150
Well, I guess I...

12:08.180 --> 12:10.015
But I also understand your point that

12:10.045 --> 12:12.566
me having another man's
baby might make you look

12:12.596 --> 12:13.966
like some kind of...

12:14.233 --> 12:17.072
I don't know...
a punk-ass chump or something.

12:17.113 --> 12:18.261
Yep, uh-huh.

12:18.291 --> 12:19.504
It... It's okay.

12:19.875 --> 12:22.098
I... I accept your decision and...

12:23.090 --> 12:24.913
Well, I'm disappointed, you know.

12:24.943 --> 12:27.412
I respect that you guys
won't change your morals

12:27.442 --> 12:29.271
for a measly $20,000.

12:29.537 --> 12:31.866
20 grand? Huh?

12:31.896 --> 12:34.942
Of course, for Bo,
it's not about the money.

12:34.972 --> 12:36.011
I didn't know there was money.

12:36.041 --> 12:37.495
I thought this was like
a dare or something.

12:37.525 --> 12:40.100
Yo, for 20 grand you can
stick whatever you want

12:40.130 --> 12:42.197
in either of us.

12:42.669 --> 12:45.514
Okay, everyone, I made some
quick shift assignment changes.

12:45.544 --> 12:48.045
Henry, Elias, you're in ladies' shoes.

12:48.075 --> 12:49.449
Mateo, you're in sports.

12:49.479 --> 12:50.310
So what do I do?

12:50.340 --> 12:52.328
Oh, ah, Kelly, you're on register.

12:52.358 --> 12:53.836
Oh, I've never done that before.

12:53.866 --> 12:55.796
Oh, I know, you're gonna
be so bad at it.

12:55.826 --> 12:56.881
Hey, Ames, what about me?

12:56.911 --> 12:58.954
Oh, Marcus, yes, you just float.

12:58.984 --> 13:00.833
I want the customers to feel
like you're everywhere.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.574
Nice. MVP.

13:02.604 --> 13:04.475
We also need someone to run
interference on Jeff.

13:04.505 --> 13:07.054
Just keep him occupied with
stories that are boring

13:07.084 --> 13:08.732
that no one would ever care about.

13:08.762 --> 13:12.030
I... will do my best to act
like somebody who does that.

13:12.060 --> 13:14.133
You don't need to act,
I mean, you're brutal...

13:14.163 --> 13:15.866
Dina. He knows what he is.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.504
All right, guys, listen up.

13:17.534 --> 13:19.205
This is not a time for words.

13:19.235 --> 13:20.463
But I should say

13:20.493 --> 13:23.385
that this is a chance for
this store to become bigger,

13:23.857 --> 13:25.109
to become more.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.781
But if we work together,

13:27.988 --> 13:30.089
we can stop that from happening.

13:30.124 --> 13:32.091
All right, guys.

13:32.126 --> 13:34.093
Bring it in. On three.

13:34.128 --> 13:35.366
- Okay.
- Ow, ow.

13:35.396 --> 13:37.101
- Hold on a sec.
- Okay, okay, okay.

13:37.131 --> 13:39.103
- No pushing.
- You just stepped on my foot.

13:39.133 --> 13:40.967
- Okay, okay.
- Be gentle.

13:41.001 --> 13:42.835
This is gonna work.

13:45.873 --> 13:50.810
<i>â™ª</i>

13:50.844 --> 13:52.349
<i>Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers,</i>

13:52.379 --> 13:55.214
there is a carbon monoxide
leak in the store.

13:55.249 --> 13:58.184
It's the silent killer,
so you're gonna wanna go.

13:58.218 --> 14:01.120
Buying some apples, huh?

14:01.155 --> 14:02.905
Whoops.

14:04.058 --> 14:05.858
Nope. Not that one.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.064
I mean, maybe it was just who we are

14:07.094 --> 14:09.133
collectively as a nation at the time,

14:09.163 --> 14:12.131
but things just really felt
like they could be solved.

14:12.166 --> 14:17.166
<i>â™ª</i>

14:19.506 --> 14:21.974
- I can't let you buy these.
- What? Why?

14:22.009 --> 14:23.643
It's been recalled, sorry.

14:23.677 --> 14:26.150
All right, now it's buzzing
at me like it's mad at me.

14:26.180 --> 14:27.847
Or something.

14:27.881 --> 14:29.420
Making some fruit salad?

14:29.450 --> 14:31.422
My wife needs this.
I promised her I'd get it.

14:31.452 --> 14:34.320
She needs them?
Nobody needs coconut shrimp.

14:34.354 --> 14:36.389
Perhaps we've lost some innocence.

14:36.423 --> 14:38.662
Perhaps the collective
zeitgeist of the country

14:38.692 --> 14:40.359
has soured.

14:40.394 --> 14:43.029
Here, let me help you with that.

14:43.063 --> 14:45.431
<i>â™ª</i>

14:45.466 --> 14:48.501
Whoo! Not today, bro.

14:48.535 --> 14:50.369
Oh, we're in.

14:51.605 --> 14:54.173
But it's not turning.

14:54.208 --> 14:55.775
Ah. Almost.

14:55.809 --> 14:57.281
But then it got good again,

14:57.311 --> 15:00.713
so I guess ultimately
"Bloodline" was worth watching.

15:01.081 --> 15:02.386
While that's fascinating,

15:02.416 --> 15:04.621
I'm not sure it constitutes an emergency

15:04.651 --> 15:06.356
that we need to talk about right now,

15:06.386 --> 15:07.891
so I gotta get back in there, okay?

15:07.921 --> 15:09.626
Wait, no, no, no, wait, no.
That wasn't the emergency.

15:09.656 --> 15:13.226
No, that was... that was just
pre-emergency small talk.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.324
No, the, um, emergency

15:15.354 --> 15:16.706
is, uh...

15:18.465 --> 15:19.252
You.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.705
What're you talking about?

15:21.735 --> 15:22.909
Aw, Jeff, come on.

15:22.939 --> 15:26.205
You're obviously going through
something and... and I...

15:26.240 --> 15:28.441
I just want you to know that I see you,

15:28.475 --> 15:32.779
and I am here if you ever wanna talk.

15:34.806 --> 15:36.073
I'd like that.

15:36.108 --> 15:38.676
Oh, you would, yeah, uh...

15:38.710 --> 15:39.677
Cool.

15:39.711 --> 15:41.078
I'm torn.

15:41.113 --> 15:42.951
On one hand,
that doesn't look good on you.

15:42.981 --> 15:44.786
On the other hand, what would?

15:46.518 --> 15:48.319
Yes, good work.

15:48.353 --> 15:49.791
I'm just saying what I feel

15:49.821 --> 15:51.927
and people do not like
what they're hearing.

15:51.957 --> 15:54.525
I am a strong cup of coffee.

15:54.559 --> 15:57.199
We're still under and we only
have five minutes till closing.

15:57.229 --> 15:59.121
We might just crap this bed yet.

16:02.968 --> 16:04.268
What's happening?

16:04.302 --> 16:05.807
- Did we hit our goal?
- No, wait.

16:05.837 --> 16:08.276
This has to be a mistake.
We're like thousands under.

16:08.306 --> 16:10.775
No, we're not. I couldn't stop him.

16:10.809 --> 16:13.177
Hell yeah.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.310
Hot tub, son. Ha-ha!

16:15.474 --> 16:16.718
Like we always dreamed of.

16:16.748 --> 16:18.787
It's gonna be like living in
a Holiday Inn Express.

16:18.817 --> 16:21.786
- We can't afford a hot tub.
- We got 20 grand now.

16:21.820 --> 16:23.692
That's literally an
infinite amount of money.

16:23.722 --> 16:25.994
No, Bo, you have
to return that right now.

16:26.024 --> 16:29.126
Can't. It's a floor model. No returns.

16:29.161 --> 16:30.465
So what does that mean?

16:30.495 --> 16:31.629
<i>â™ª</i>

16:31.663 --> 16:34.832
Congrats. We're officially Quad-A.

16:34.866 --> 16:36.634
May God have mercy on us all.

16:36.668 --> 16:41.572
<i>â™ª Feelin' hot, hot, hot â™ª</i>

16:41.606 --> 16:44.508
This is a disaster.
Why are you dropping balloons?

16:44.543 --> 16:46.481
It's not my fault canceling balloon drop

16:46.511 --> 16:48.850
looks the exact same
as dropping balloons.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.015
<i>â™ª</i>

16:51.463 --> 16:52.874
You think you know where
your life is going.

16:52.904 --> 16:54.115
And then suddenly, you're 40,

16:54.145 --> 16:56.067
running a rat race
you don't even understand.

16:56.097 --> 16:57.482
You're trying to fix
everything on the outside.

16:57.512 --> 16:59.702
So I get the boots, I get the earring.

16:59.732 --> 17:01.493
- I get the lipo.
- The hat.

17:02.030 --> 17:04.607
What's wrong with the hat?
The hat's working.

17:04.642 --> 17:06.349
Exactly. Yeah, nothing.

17:07.478 --> 17:08.599
Where was I?

17:08.630 --> 17:10.954
Okay, so I put all the important dates

17:10.984 --> 17:12.944
on this pregnancy calendar, see?

17:12.974 --> 17:17.153
Like the implantation
and the ultrasounds.

17:17.183 --> 17:18.925
So I guess you know
what you're gonna be doing

17:18.955 --> 17:21.479
with all your free time
for the next nine months.

17:21.509 --> 17:25.214
Great, I'll be pregnant
when it's really hot.

17:25.752 --> 17:26.928
That's fun.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.550
Cheyenne, do you really wanna do this?

17:31.823 --> 17:33.468
Mm-hmm.

17:33.498 --> 17:35.279
I'm really happy about it.

17:37.689 --> 17:38.827
The deal's off.

17:38.857 --> 17:40.157
No, I can do it.

17:40.192 --> 17:41.726
I don't want you to.

17:41.760 --> 17:45.796
Because I don't want my baby
carried by a huge stinker,

17:45.831 --> 17:47.569
- like you.
- I'm a stinker?

17:47.599 --> 17:49.100
You're a fat bitch.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.769
Oh, wait, you're being nice.

17:51.803 --> 17:54.405
No, I'm not being nice. I'm being mean.

17:54.439 --> 17:57.942
And... now I don't
want a big stinky baby

17:57.976 --> 17:59.810
from a big stinker like you.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.846
Get out of my office.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.781
You're stinking up the place.

18:03.815 --> 18:05.983
Pee-yew! Ugh.

18:06.018 --> 18:09.004
Go take a bath in some tomatoes.

18:12.057 --> 18:14.025
Quad-A, after all.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.399
We were so close.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.361
I just gotta say...

18:17.396 --> 18:20.131
Been a privilege
taking breaks with you guys.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.433
Sitting here, looking at my phone,

18:22.467 --> 18:24.942
while you guys are
looking at your phones.

18:25.704 --> 18:26.987
I'm gonna miss it.

18:27.136 --> 18:29.111
We never appreciated what we had here.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.886
Let's relax. It was a crappy store.

18:32.377 --> 18:33.660
Yeah, fair enough.

18:33.845 --> 18:35.389
It'll be fine, you guys.

18:35.747 --> 18:37.269
We'll clean as we go.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.409
We'll clean as we go.

18:41.553 --> 18:44.055
How do you get money
stains off your hands?

18:44.089 --> 18:45.394
What're you talking about?

18:45.424 --> 18:47.029
You know how when you handle money,

18:47.059 --> 18:49.126
the ink comes off on your hands?

18:51.668 --> 18:52.634
Another counterfeit.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.736
But I used the pen thingy
and it was yellow.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.370
Yeah, that means fake. You want brown.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.407
I thought it was,
If it's yellow, let it mellow.

18:58.437 --> 18:59.574
Wait, no, that's piss.

18:59.604 --> 19:01.706
There are so many of these.

19:01.740 --> 19:02.840
Where we at?

19:05.243 --> 19:07.344
We're not Quad-A. We did it!

19:08.780 --> 19:13.084
- Alright!
- You tiny little fool.

19:13.118 --> 19:16.387
We're not number one.
We're not nu... no.

19:16.421 --> 19:18.089
It doesn't work as well.

19:18.123 --> 19:21.225
I guess it was when Mateo
dumped me, you know, I just...

19:21.259 --> 19:22.698
I just dove into my work,

19:22.728 --> 19:24.700
'cause I thought that would
be fulfilling, but...

19:24.730 --> 19:27.598
So here I am, on the cusp of
having a Quad-A store

19:27.632 --> 19:31.335
and it's like, I don't even
know if I want that, you know?

19:31.369 --> 19:34.004
Oh, actually, we didn't make Quad-A.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.606
What? Dammit.

19:35.640 --> 19:39.243
- Oh, no, it's gonna be...
- No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:39.277 --> 19:42.012
This is bad. I can't go home, Jonah.

19:42.047 --> 19:44.515
I'm [bleep]. I'm [bleep].

19:44.549 --> 19:47.451
I bought a Subaru! That money's gone!

19:47.486 --> 19:49.191
Gone. I couldn't wait a week?

19:49.221 --> 19:51.856
One week. No discipline.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.524
[bleep]!

19:54.559 --> 19:56.193
- Hey, Glenn.
- Mm.

19:56.223 --> 19:57.966
Just wanted to let you know
we didn't make the target.

19:57.996 --> 19:59.322
No Quad-A.

19:59.352 --> 20:00.629
Oh, okay.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.201
- You all right?
- Hmm?

20:04.236 --> 20:05.576
Yeah, I'll be fine.

20:06.471 --> 20:09.140
I was so close to having a baby.

20:09.174 --> 20:09.959
But...

20:10.842 --> 20:12.710
You wanna be my surrogate?

20:12.744 --> 20:14.416
The idea of carrying your child

20:14.446 --> 20:16.151
makes me wanna put
a bullet through my uterus.

20:16.181 --> 20:17.782
I was joking.

20:17.812 --> 20:19.321
I wouldn't want you to carry my baby

20:19.351 --> 20:21.379
if you paid me the $20,000.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.455
Wait, you're paying $20,000?

20:24.489 --> 20:26.661
Just for someone to squirt out your kid?

20:26.691 --> 20:28.507
Well, yeah, a little bit more.

20:29.094 --> 20:32.496
I mean, that's practically
what I take home in a year.

20:32.531 --> 20:36.133
I could fix up my house.
Pay off my credit card bills.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.974
I could put my mom away
for good with money like that.

20:39.004 --> 20:40.182
Well, I mean...

20:41.439 --> 20:44.642
If that's something you wanted,
I could think about it.

20:44.676 --> 20:47.311
I mean, if <i>you were interested</i>

20:47.345 --> 20:49.847
then <i>I</i> would think about it.

20:49.881 --> 20:54.285
- It's not something I want.
- Oh, I would want it far less.

21:02.394 --> 21:04.028
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.362
This is cool.

21:05.397 --> 21:06.701
You know, I've always wanted

21:06.731 --> 21:08.370
to have a family of my own someday,

21:08.400 --> 21:09.538
so it'll be great
to have a practice baby

21:09.568 --> 21:11.006
where nothing matters.

21:11.036 --> 21:13.056
- Wait, wait...
- Like, whatever happens to it

21:13.086 --> 21:15.506
happens to it, you know?
