00:12.869 --> 00:14.299
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

00:14.300 --> 00:16.070
You have to help me. Please.

00:16.071 --> 00:17.779
I only have a few seconds left.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.152
Ma'am, what's your address?

00:19.291 --> 00:22.447
250 Avenue C. Please hurry.

00:22.448 --> 00:23.269
We'll send help right away.

00:23.270 --> 00:24.992
Can you tell me
what's happening?

00:25.719 --> 00:27.944
Ma'am, I need to know
what's going on.

00:30.662 --> 00:31.345
Oh, my God.

00:31.346 --> 00:32.533
Ma'am, can you hear me?

00:33.996 --> 00:35.357
The lights went out.

00:36.128 --> 00:37.028
It's coming for me.

00:37.029 --> 00:39.004
What's coming for you? Ma'am?

00:39.931 --> 00:41.345
Ma'am?

00:42.345 --> 00:43.531
I'm gonna die.

00:44.030 --> 00:46.239
Ma'am are you there? Hello.

00:47.376 --> 00:49.574
Ma'am are you there? Hello.

00:52.181 --> 00:53.168
You hear that?

00:53.169 --> 00:56.705
That call came in at 11:59
from our vic... Val Butler.

00:56.706 --> 00:58.086
She's an ad exec downtown.

00:58.087 --> 00:59.890
First responders
came moments later.

00:59.891 --> 01:02.105
That door was locked and that
couch was in front of it.

01:02.106 --> 01:03.629
No sign of forced entry.

01:06.058 --> 01:08.404
She looks like she's been
scared to death, literally.

01:08.577 --> 01:11.974
Is that based on your vast
medical experience, Mr. Castle?

01:11.975 --> 01:12.903
No, based on the fact

01:12.904 --> 01:14.818
she looks like an
Edvard Munch painting.

01:14.907 --> 01:16.037
Really freaky.

01:16.038 --> 01:17.636
So what was the cause of death?

01:17.637 --> 01:19.468
Well, there's no
external trauma,

01:19.469 --> 01:21.211
no puncture or stab wounds.

01:21.212 --> 01:22.167
Once I get her on the slab,

01:22.168 --> 01:25.107
I'll know more about how
she died and who did it.

01:25.108 --> 01:26.427
If it was a who.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.293
Meaning?

01:28.350 --> 01:30.570
Meaning she said "It's
coming for me."

01:30.571 --> 01:33.003
Not "he" or "she," but "it."

01:33.423 --> 01:34.809
Look at what she was
researching here...

01:34.810 --> 01:36.303
"How to keep away evil,"

01:36.304 --> 01:38.308
"How to ward off evil spirits,"

01:38.309 --> 01:39.916
a book on urban legends.

01:39.917 --> 01:42.261
Over by the door, horseshoes.

01:42.262 --> 01:44.219
I've clocked two
Indian wind chimes,

01:44.220 --> 01:45.664
there and there.

01:45.665 --> 01:48.029
These are things used to
ward off evil spirits,

01:48.220 --> 01:49.361
like Perlmutter.

01:49.362 --> 01:50.424
I heard that.

01:50.568 --> 01:51.812
What are you saying, Castle?

01:51.813 --> 01:54.307
Oh, was the boogeyman
out to get her?

01:54.308 --> 01:57.179
I'm saying maybe that's
what she thought...

01:57.180 --> 01:59.461
why she said "It's
coming for me,"

01:59.462 --> 02:01.130
why the lights went out,

02:01.131 --> 02:04.707
why she inexplicably died,
and why she looks so scared.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.963
She was scared because she
was about to be killed

02:06.964 --> 02:08.451
by an actual person.

02:08.452 --> 02:11.218
So we should spend our time
looking for that person.

02:11.294 --> 02:13.256
Let's set up a canvass and talk
to everyone in the building

02:13.257 --> 02:14.594
that might have seen
or heard something.

02:14.595 --> 02:15.969
Wh-what happened to Val?

02:16.382 --> 02:17.714
What's going on?

02:22.142 --> 02:22.863
I work nights

02:22.864 --> 02:24.809
as a research assistant
at the college.

02:25.132 --> 02:26.807
But I should've stayed
home last night.

02:27.344 --> 02:28.962
I knew something
was up with her.

02:28.963 --> 02:30.038
What do you mean?

02:30.045 --> 02:32.084
She's been weird the
past couple of days.

02:32.536 --> 02:34.725
She hadn't been
eating or sleeping.

02:35.168 --> 02:38.237
She was really paranoid,
always locking the doors.

02:38.323 --> 02:39.674
Did she say what was wrong?

02:40.181 --> 02:41.347
I asked,

02:41.610 --> 02:43.807
but she said she didn't
want to talk about it.

02:44.009 --> 02:45.221
Amanda, do you know of anyone

02:45.222 --> 02:46.594
that would've
wanted to hurt her?

02:47.788 --> 02:49.243
Her ex-boyfriend.

02:50.526 --> 02:52.044
Boyfriend's name
is Freddie Baker,

02:52.045 --> 02:52.971
31.

02:52.972 --> 02:55.134
Quite the resume...
resisting arrest,

02:55.135 --> 02:56.250
assault and battery.

02:56.251 --> 02:57.265
Sounds like a prince.

02:57.266 --> 02:58.511
Yeah, Val wised up, though.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.001
She filed a restraining order
against him after they broke up.

03:01.002 --> 03:03.482
Esposito is checking into
where he was last night.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.306
So what did we get from
Val's family and friends?

03:05.307 --> 03:06.542
Just that they hadn't
heard from her

03:06.543 --> 03:07.793
in the last three days.

03:07.794 --> 03:08.977
She wasn't returning
their messages.

03:08.978 --> 03:10.632
Three days... that's how
long Val's roommate

03:10.633 --> 03:11.691
said she'd been
acting strangely.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.568
Yeah, so I dug into the
last 72 hours of her life.

03:14.569 --> 03:15.704
Besides a credit card charge

03:15.705 --> 03:17.161
for a train ticket to Greenwich,

03:17.162 --> 03:18.315
there was nothing else unusual.

03:18.316 --> 03:19.523
What was she doing in Greenwich?

03:19.524 --> 03:20.619
I'm still looking into that,

03:20.620 --> 03:22.965
but as far as abnormalities
for the last few days,

03:22.966 --> 03:23.665
that was it.

03:23.666 --> 03:25.602
Uh, no, there's more.
The wind chime,

03:25.603 --> 03:28.206
the horse shoe, the
book on urban legends...

03:28.416 --> 03:30.141
all bought online two days ago.

03:30.142 --> 03:31.852
Almost as if Val thought

03:31.853 --> 03:33.813
some kind of evil spirit
was coming for her.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.176
Castle, what she thought
was gonna happen

03:35.177 --> 03:36.213
versus what actually happened

03:36.214 --> 03:37.668
are two completely
different things.

03:37.669 --> 03:39.643
Yeah, because if Val was
a victim of anything,

03:39.644 --> 03:41.267
it's her lousy taste in men.

03:41.505 --> 03:42.547
Canvass popped.

03:42.548 --> 03:44.123
One of her neighbors saw
Freddie in the building

03:44.124 --> 03:45.438
and hour before her death.

03:46.587 --> 03:48.316
I would never hurt Val.

03:48.569 --> 03:49.577
I loved her.

03:49.578 --> 03:52.416
Really? Then how do you explain
this restraining order

03:52.417 --> 03:54.022
that she filed against you?

03:54.023 --> 03:55.396
Was that a love letter?

03:55.635 --> 03:56.819
A misunderstanding.

03:56.820 --> 03:57.941
Well, we got a
witness that saw you

03:57.942 --> 03:59.552
in Val's apartment
last night, Freddie.

03:59.553 --> 04:00.905
But I didn't kill her.

04:01.451 --> 04:03.132
Yes, I went over there,

04:03.133 --> 04:05.261
but only because
she begged me to.

04:05.262 --> 04:06.760
Do you actually
expect us to believe

04:06.761 --> 04:08.761
that she invited you
over to her apartment

04:08.762 --> 04:10.693
after she filed a
restraining order?

04:10.694 --> 04:12.983
It's true. She said she
wanted to get back together.

04:13.380 --> 04:15.056
But when I got there,
all she did was

04:15.057 --> 04:17.380
accuse me of sending
her some package.

04:18.005 --> 04:18.949
What package?

04:18.950 --> 04:20.267
I have no idea.

04:20.295 --> 04:22.413
But when I told her I
didn't send her anything,

04:23.562 --> 04:24.877
she started freaking out.

04:24.878 --> 04:25.967
How was she freaking out?

04:25.968 --> 04:28.602
She kept saying, "It's real."

04:29.664 --> 04:30.599
What's real?

04:30.600 --> 04:31.750
I don't know.

04:32.002 --> 04:34.269
She wasn't making... any sense.

04:34.270 --> 04:35.707
She kept asking me

04:35.810 --> 04:38.878
if I believed in
the power of evil.

04:41.951 --> 04:44.055
I didn't want to get in trouble
for breaking the RO,

04:44.056 --> 04:46.238
so I got out of there, went
to hang out with friends.

04:46.239 --> 04:47.630
But when I left that apartment,

04:48.152 --> 04:49.663
Val was alive.

04:49.774 --> 04:51.120
I swear.

04:53.563 --> 04:54.798
Freddie's alibi checks out.

04:54.799 --> 04:56.212
Friends confirm that
he met them at 11:00.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.784
They hung out at a
club till dawn.

04:57.785 --> 04:59.343
So he's not our guy.

04:59.344 --> 05:01.960
Well, I'll just point
out that Val asked him

05:01.961 --> 05:03.458
if he believed in
the power of evil

05:03.459 --> 05:05.679
and then was talking
about how it was "real."

05:05.680 --> 05:07.291
- I hate to say it...
- Then don't.

05:08.535 --> 05:10.603
Did CSU find a package
at her apartment?

05:10.604 --> 05:13.329
No, but they were looking for
evidence of the murder not mail.

05:13.330 --> 05:15.207
So maybe that's what
freaked Val out.

05:15.208 --> 05:15.735
She knew that

05:15.736 --> 05:18.389
that package was coming
from her killer.

05:20.270 --> 05:21.679
Did you find anything yet?

05:22.942 --> 05:25.851
Yes, a closet with more
stilettos than yours.

05:25.852 --> 05:27.116
Didn't think it was possible.

05:27.643 --> 05:29.086
How about you?
Any luck?

05:29.976 --> 05:32.362
Uh, yes.
Looks like the package she got

05:32.363 --> 05:34.833
contained a CD or a DVD

05:34.834 --> 05:36.886
so be on the lookout for a disc.

05:37.016 --> 05:39.205
Disc, got ya.

05:49.427 --> 05:50.451
Help me.

05:57.344 --> 05:58.647
Uh, Beckett?

06:06.334 --> 06:07.382
Beckett?

06:07.861 --> 06:09.124
Can you come here?

06:11.902 --> 06:13.001
You saw...

06:13.002 --> 06:14.718
midnight on the third day...

06:14.719 --> 06:16.017
you die!

06:16.910 --> 06:18.658
Are you okay?
Did you find something?

06:20.003 --> 06:21.646
When did you say Val
got that package?

06:21.647 --> 06:23.069
Three days before she died.

06:23.869 --> 06:25.561
That was midnight
on the third day.

06:29.146 --> 06:31.042
She died because
she saw this disc.

06:31.491 --> 06:32.875
And now I saw it,

06:34.058 --> 06:35.539
which means I'm next.

06:38.852 --> 06:42.852
Castle s05e17

Corrections by Alex1969
WEB-DL re-sync by lost0ne, www. addic7ed. com

06:47.145 --> 06:48.896
"Legend tells of a
mysterious video

06:48.897 --> 06:52.019
"that can harness the forces
of evil from the beyond.

06:52.087 --> 06:54.907
"The disc is a harbinger
of great misfortune,

06:54.908 --> 06:56.207
"marking its watchers

06:56.208 --> 06:59.643
and sentencing them to certain
and unavoidable death."

06:59.810 --> 07:01.878
I saw it, just like Val did.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.473
That's why she said
"It's coming for me."

07:03.474 --> 07:05.107
That's how she knew
when she was gonna die,

07:05.108 --> 07:06.606
why she was trying to
ward off spirits...

07:06.607 --> 07:08.946
because of the message
on that disc.

07:08.952 --> 07:10.253
How's a DVD gonna kill you?

07:10.254 --> 07:12.689
Is it gonna come at you like a
ninja star, cut your head off?

07:12.690 --> 07:14.890
The actual DVD will not
kill me, Esposito.

07:14.891 --> 07:17.560
It will be the spirit
inside the DVD,

07:17.561 --> 07:18.768
just like in "The Ring."

07:18.769 --> 07:20.544
Ooh, ooh, the one...

07:20.545 --> 07:21.901
with the creepy
waterlogged little girl

07:21.902 --> 07:22.899
who crawls out of the TV.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.448
I didn't sleep for
days after that movie.

07:24.449 --> 07:27.212
Yes, exactly. Thank you.
That movie.

07:27.213 --> 07:28.215
It's fiction.

07:28.216 --> 07:31.455
It's a horror story in a
book about urban legends.

07:31.456 --> 07:32.888
Yeah, I mean, because...

07:33.262 --> 07:35.279
that's all it is, right?

07:35.280 --> 07:36.634
A legend.

07:37.378 --> 07:38.924
Many legends are based in truth.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.152
I saw the video.

07:40.286 --> 07:42.793
At midnight in three
days time, I will die.

07:42.937 --> 07:45.091
Oh, Castle, that message
wasn't for you.

07:45.092 --> 07:47.937
It was a threat for Val.
And it wasn't made by spirits.

07:47.938 --> 07:49.679
It was made by her murderer.

07:49.698 --> 07:52.112
So tracing the disc
to whoever sent it

07:52.113 --> 07:53.534
should lead us straight to him.

07:53.535 --> 07:54.536
- Espo.
- Yeah.

07:54.537 --> 07:57.660
There's a PO box on this airbill.
Could you look into it?

07:57.661 --> 07:58.306
Yeah.

07:58.329 --> 08:00.163
And, Ryan, why don't you
take a look at this disc and see...

08:00.164 --> 08:01.815
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, what?

08:04.003 --> 08:04.990
Et tu, bro?

08:04.991 --> 08:07.591
What did you say about the
story being a legend?

08:07.592 --> 08:09.151
Um, well, uh,

08:09.193 --> 08:10.294
Jenny and I,

08:10.295 --> 08:12.048
we are trying to make a baby,

08:12.049 --> 08:14.531
so we're abiding by every
superstition in the book.

08:14.540 --> 08:16.739
Okay. Fine.
Here, Espo.

08:16.740 --> 08:18.708
Oh, nah. I c... I can't...

08:18.709 --> 08:19.985
I can't watch that.

08:19.986 --> 08:21.823
If I watch that, it's
gonna make my partner out

08:21.824 --> 08:23.235
to be a wimp,

08:23.252 --> 08:24.348
and I can't have that.

08:24.349 --> 08:25.703
- Thanks, bro.
- Yeah.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.211
This is so pathetic.

08:27.212 --> 08:28.764
Fine. I will watch it.

08:30.998 --> 08:32.436
Wait. No. What are you doing?

08:32.888 --> 08:33.841
Castle, I'm doing my job.

08:33.842 --> 08:34.900
Someone here has to.

08:34.902 --> 08:36.058
Okay, think of the risks.

08:36.059 --> 08:37.624
You may not think there's
anything to this,

08:37.625 --> 08:38.716
but what if you're wrong?

08:38.717 --> 08:40.168
You know, I appreciate
your concern,

08:40.169 --> 08:41.707
but it's just a DVD.

08:42.123 --> 08:43.695
You... you don't... you
can't just play it.

08:43.696 --> 08:45.854
Let me take precautions here.

08:46.163 --> 08:48.822
Don't want the whole
precinct suffering my fate.

08:58.111 --> 08:59.815
Okay. Okay.

09:00.447 --> 09:01.472
You want to hold my hand?

09:01.473 --> 09:02.680
Castle, I'm not scared.

09:02.681 --> 09:04.544
Well, I wasn't asking for you.

09:06.586 --> 09:07.531
Are you ready?

09:07.532 --> 09:08.735
Does it matter?

09:11.095 --> 09:12.257
Help me.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.004
What are those sounds?

09:19.005 --> 09:20.341
Right? It gets worse.

09:24.968 --> 09:26.215
Wait for it.

09:30.691 --> 09:31.753
You saw...

09:31.754 --> 09:33.541
midnight on the third day...

09:33.547 --> 09:34.943
you die!

09:36.694 --> 09:38.578
You're right.
It is kinda creepy.

09:38.579 --> 09:39.366
Thank you.

09:39.367 --> 09:41.791
Because the killer made
it creepy, Castle.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.154
Maybe these images meant
something to the victim,

09:45.155 --> 09:48.240
clues to the relationship
between her and the killer.

09:51.065 --> 09:52.212
Wait.

09:52.801 --> 09:53.953
Go back.

09:54.301 --> 09:56.586
That one... that one there.
That's the, um...

09:57.103 --> 09:59.932
That's the Tibetan wheel.
Symbolizes rebirth.

10:02.995 --> 10:04.264
Hang on.

10:04.559 --> 10:06.776
That is the Masonic compass.
That's...

10:07.558 --> 10:10.050
They felt it represented,
uh, resurrection.

10:10.655 --> 10:11.430
Your point being?

10:11.431 --> 10:12.355
Oh.

10:13.039 --> 10:15.679
Rebirth? Resurrection?

10:16.299 --> 10:19.390
This video obviously resurrects
something from the great beyond,

10:19.391 --> 10:20.251
something dangerous,

10:20.252 --> 10:22.354
something... murderous.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.947
I mean, what other
explanation can there be?

10:23.948 --> 10:25.596
There are plenty of
explanations, Castle,

10:25.597 --> 10:27.473
and none of them
are supernatural.

10:27.474 --> 10:30.614
In fact, I bet Perlmutter has
our cause of death by now.

10:30.615 --> 10:34.158
Those tox and autopsy
reports should be done.

10:39.910 --> 10:41.468
Ah, Detective Beckett

10:42.084 --> 10:43.759
and defective Castle.

10:44.778 --> 10:48.210
So, Perlmutter, how was
Val Butler killed?

10:48.405 --> 10:51.144
It appears she died
of heart failure.

10:51.145 --> 10:52.327
At 27?

10:52.328 --> 10:53.911
Did she have heart problems?

10:54.299 --> 10:57.158
Well, she certainly did
once it stopped beating.

10:57.159 --> 10:58.324
What made it stop?

10:58.325 --> 11:00.709
Is it possible that
she was poisoned

11:00.835 --> 11:02.509
or OD'ed on drugs?

11:02.510 --> 11:05.132
Nothing showed up on
her blood panels.

11:05.133 --> 11:06.830
What about what caused her, um...

11:08.037 --> 11:10.606
Well, postmortem contractions
of the facial muscles

11:10.607 --> 11:12.108
are not unheard of.

11:12.249 --> 11:13.477
You don't know what killed her.

11:13.478 --> 11:15.037
- I wouldn't say that.
- Do you have a theory?

11:15.038 --> 11:16.167
Not at the present time.

11:16.168 --> 11:17.319
That means you don't know.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.707
And the only explanation

11:18.708 --> 11:20.441
is that Val faced
something so scary,

11:20.442 --> 11:22.274
it stopped her heart
and froze her face

11:22.275 --> 11:24.537
in the last expression
she had, terror.

11:24.538 --> 11:25.622
Admit it.

11:27.325 --> 11:30.091
All I'll say, Mr. Castle,
is that for now,

11:30.092 --> 11:31.599
cause of death is unknown.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.724
Unknown?

11:33.157 --> 11:34.281
Hear that?

11:35.161 --> 11:36.273
Not good.

11:36.476 --> 11:37.567
What are you doing?

11:37.583 --> 11:38.806
Checking my bucket list

11:38.807 --> 11:41.294
to see how many things I
can get done in two days.

11:41.477 --> 11:43.900
Can either one of you
introduce me to Bill Shatner?

11:45.515 --> 11:46.847
You know, finding
who sent this disc

11:46.848 --> 11:48.575
should make Castle feel
a whole lot better.

11:48.894 --> 11:50.411
Yeah, but what if
the worst happens

11:50.412 --> 11:51.990
and... and Castle's right?

11:52.422 --> 11:53.908
Do you think he put
me in his will?

11:53.916 --> 11:55.750
Dude, uncool.

11:55.751 --> 11:56.582
What?

11:56.583 --> 11:57.246
I'm just wondering.

11:57.247 --> 11:59.589
I mean, Castle's death
would be sad and all,

11:59.590 --> 12:02.511
but his Ferrari sure
would lessen my grief.

12:02.628 --> 12:05.058
You do realize that even putting
that out in the universe

12:05.059 --> 12:06.012
is bad karma?

12:06.013 --> 12:08.171
Please. Castle's not gonna die.

12:08.414 --> 12:09.802
We're not dealing
with an evil spirit.

12:09.803 --> 12:12.073
We're dealing with a guy who
has a return address.

12:12.089 --> 12:12.925
Uh-huh.

12:13.181 --> 12:15.781
Why does everybody keep
asking about box 1135?

12:15.782 --> 12:17.358
Wait. Who else has
been asking about it?

12:17.523 --> 12:19.994
Some brunette chick came
in here a couple days ago.

12:19.995 --> 12:21.243
Probably Val.

12:21.416 --> 12:22.447
What did you tell her?

12:22.448 --> 12:23.630
Nothing, bruh.

12:23.787 --> 12:25.125
It's against company policy.

12:25.126 --> 12:28.082
Well, I think that this
trumps company policy.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.639
So who owns the box?

12:29.695 --> 12:31.550
Ah, that's the weird thing.

12:31.551 --> 12:35.270
The guy who owns it died,
like, three months ago.

12:35.271 --> 12:36.937
So he couldn't have
sent that package

12:36.938 --> 12:39.817
unless he sent it from
the great beyond.

12:40.811 --> 12:42.938
The box was last rented
by an Andrew Levine,

12:42.939 --> 12:44.820
who died of liver failure
three months ago.

12:44.821 --> 12:46.493
Somehow I don't think he's
connected to this case.

12:46.494 --> 12:47.631
So the killer
covered his tracks.

12:47.632 --> 12:50.570
He must have written a random
PO box on the packaging slip.

12:50.571 --> 12:53.906
- Or...
- No. Ryan, there is no "or."

12:53.907 --> 12:55.620
I'm just saying,
maybe the reason

12:55.621 --> 12:57.029
we can't trace this
package's origin

12:57.030 --> 12:58.790
is because it was sent
from another realm.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.877
Ryan's right.
It was sent from another realm.

13:02.088 --> 13:03.382
New Jersey.

13:03.414 --> 13:05.837
I looked into the airbill
number on Val's package.

13:05.838 --> 13:07.918
Turns out it's one in a
sequence of airbills

13:07.919 --> 13:09.902
all sent from the same guy...

13:10.035 --> 13:11.260
Jason Bennett.

13:11.411 --> 13:12.670
He lives in Hoboken.

13:14.337 --> 13:15.540
NYPD!

13:20.156 --> 13:21.728
Hey, bro.
I just want you to know...

13:23.317 --> 13:24.131
I just thought you should know

13:24.132 --> 13:25.587
that I really value
our friendship.

13:26.583 --> 13:28.436
Okay. Thanks.

13:29.022 --> 13:30.273
It's priceless to me.

13:31.945 --> 13:32.899
Great.

13:32.900 --> 13:35.623
But if we could put a price
on it, what would that be?

13:36.812 --> 13:38.061
What are you talking about?

13:38.062 --> 13:40.116
I just want to know how much
our friendship would be worth

13:40.117 --> 13:41.000
if you were...

13:41.001 --> 13:41.996
Dead!

13:47.140 --> 13:48.646
We got to Bennett too late.

13:48.708 --> 13:51.447
Yeah, uh, about two
days too late.

13:51.448 --> 13:53.318
That looks like about how
long he's been dead.

13:53.319 --> 13:54.634
He couldn't have killed Val.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.623
And he got a package

13:56.624 --> 13:59.121
with a disc in it just
like Val, four days ago.

13:59.122 --> 14:00.649
There was a blackout here, too.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.990
Same MO, same freaky-ass body.

14:03.094 --> 14:04.464
The third day at midnight.

14:05.082 --> 14:06.864
I knew I shouldn't have
let you watch that disc.

14:07.541 --> 14:09.187
Now in 48 hours...

14:10.034 --> 14:11.297
we'll both be dead.

14:20.056 --> 14:21.717
CSU just found
a stack of airbills

14:21.718 --> 14:22.801
at Jason's place.

14:22.802 --> 14:24.195
So then the killer
used one of them

14:24.196 --> 14:25.810
to send the disc to Val.

14:25.856 --> 14:27.570
Maybe we should make
a copy of the DVD

14:27.571 --> 14:28.661
and send it to someone else.

14:28.662 --> 14:30.193
That's how they saved
people in "The Ring."

14:30.194 --> 14:31.666
Yeah, but all those people
who got a copy died.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.816
Yeah, you'd just be passing
the buck off to someone else.

14:33.817 --> 14:34.602
That's cold, bro.

14:34.603 --> 14:36.378
Okay, does anyone have
a better solution?

14:36.379 --> 14:37.530
Because we need one,

14:37.554 --> 14:39.473
if not for me, at
least for Beckett.

14:39.474 --> 14:42.461
Castle, that's so sweet.
You want me to outlive you?

14:42.462 --> 14:43.511
Of course.

14:43.512 --> 14:46.418
Who else is gonna tell my tale
of sacrifice and selflessness?

14:46.419 --> 14:48.767
Okay, we won't be telling
anyone anything.

14:48.768 --> 14:50.049
We're both gonna be fine.

14:50.050 --> 14:51.876
How can you say that
when we have not one

14:51.877 --> 14:54.182
but two dead DVD watchers?

14:54.183 --> 14:55.572
There's gotta be a
better connection

14:55.573 --> 14:57.982
between our two victims
than that disc.

14:57.983 --> 14:59.728
Ryan, can you check in
with Jason's family,

14:59.729 --> 15:01.216
see if anyone recognizes Val?

15:01.217 --> 15:02.122
Yeah. On it.

15:02.394 --> 15:04.552
Espo, why don't you
cross-reference their records

15:04.553 --> 15:05.946
and see if there are
any similarities

15:05.947 --> 15:07.470
between the two of them?

15:08.100 --> 15:09.902
You know, if there's gonna be
pictures of us hanging up there,

15:09.903 --> 15:11.258
we should really
pick 'em out now.

15:11.259 --> 15:12.375
You know, Castle...

15:13.276 --> 15:14.603
we could always use the photo

15:14.604 --> 15:16.916
that I took of you in
bed the other night.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.687
I don't know if that's how
I want to be remembered.

15:18.688 --> 15:20.470
Castle, I was joking.

15:20.471 --> 15:22.538
There will be no photos of
us on that murder board.

15:22.539 --> 15:24.110
By tomorrow, we are
gonna find a connection

15:24.111 --> 15:25.074
between our two victims

15:25.075 --> 15:27.562
that will leads us straight
to a flesh-and-blood killer.

15:27.563 --> 15:28.606
In the meantime...

15:29.441 --> 15:30.904
It's getting kinda late, okay?

15:30.905 --> 15:33.308
So why don't we just
call it a night?

15:33.357 --> 15:34.553
You know what? Actually...

15:35.102 --> 15:36.968
we could go back to
my place tonight

15:36.969 --> 15:38.429
and take some more photos.

15:39.374 --> 15:40.987
Well, I might be convin...

15:40.988 --> 15:42.137
Whoa. Wait a minute.

15:42.854 --> 15:45.075
In every horror movie
I've ever seen...

15:46.021 --> 15:48.082
having sex pretty
much guarantees

15:48.083 --> 15:48.993
we will die.

15:48.994 --> 15:51.158
So... for the safety of us both,

15:51.159 --> 15:52.746
I say we just hold off.

15:52.747 --> 15:53.673
Are you sure?

15:53.921 --> 15:55.695
I mean, think about it, Castle.

15:55.696 --> 15:57.617
This could be our last time.

15:58.013 --> 15:59.177
That's... okay...

15:59.322 --> 16:00.660
What you're doing right now,

16:00.661 --> 16:02.088
this is not helping. This...

16:02.089 --> 16:05.601
I'm gonna...
remove myself from temptation.

16:05.722 --> 16:08.577
A good night's sleep will
give me some perspective.

16:28.209 --> 16:29.456
I... this is...

16:39.391 --> 16:40.109
Hello.

16:40.110 --> 16:42.045
Wes. Hey, it's Rick.

16:42.052 --> 16:43.693
Jeez, Rick. It's after midnight.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.763
Yeah, sorry.
I just, um, I need some advice.

16:46.764 --> 16:49.102
Is Stephen King beating you
at Texas hold'em again?

16:49.103 --> 16:50.365
Yeah, right.

16:50.366 --> 16:53.239
No, but, um, this is
actually about your movies.

16:53.240 --> 16:57.405
I mean, the name Wes Craven
is synonymous with horror.

16:57.406 --> 17:00.284
You've made a fortune scaring
the crap out of people.

17:00.285 --> 17:01.305
"My Soul To Take,"

17:01.306 --> 17:02.805
all the "Nightmare
On Elm Streets,"

17:02.806 --> 17:03.814
terrifying.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.309
So you called me up in
the middle of the night

17:05.310 --> 17:06.763
to join my fan club, what?

17:06.765 --> 17:08.813
Ha ha. No.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.561
I know that you've
researched evil spirits

17:12.563 --> 17:15.558
who reach out from the
beyond for all your films.

17:15.628 --> 17:16.732
Of course.

17:17.089 --> 17:18.377
I was just wondering if you knew

17:18.377 --> 17:20.513
how to stop those pesky suckers.

17:21.275 --> 17:22.922
Is this you making
your own movie?

17:22.923 --> 17:25.040
I mean, are you writing
a horror screenplay?

17:26.375 --> 17:27.196
Yes.

17:27.198 --> 17:29.472
I just thought I'd give you a
little friendly competition.

17:29.473 --> 17:31.998
Just got a little
writer's block is all.

17:32.026 --> 17:33.466
Okay, what's the story?

17:33.537 --> 17:36.007
Um... ruggedly handsome hero

17:36.008 --> 17:39.134
and his notoriously
practical lady friend

17:39.140 --> 17:42.011
watch a disc that's killing its
viewers within three days.

17:42.134 --> 17:44.507
Really? You don't think
that's a little derivative?

17:44.508 --> 17:46.740
Yes, but I am

17:46.910 --> 17:48.554
hoping to distinguish
the ending,

17:48.555 --> 17:51.588
you know, make the third
act a, um, survival tale

17:51.589 --> 17:52.382
rather than a bloodbath.

17:52.383 --> 17:53.829
I just can't... figure out

17:53.830 --> 17:55.946
how to get my heroes
out of this mess.

17:55.947 --> 17:58.343
So the key is always in the
spirit's origin story.

17:58.344 --> 17:59.060
Once you have that,

17:59.061 --> 18:01.684
you can start to figure out
the spirit's weaknesses.

18:01.729 --> 18:05.508
If it's using the disc as its
portal into our world...

18:05.509 --> 18:07.328
Then the disc would
contain clues

18:07.329 --> 18:09.143
as to the spirit's story.

18:09.144 --> 18:10.960
Wes, thank you.

18:11.388 --> 18:13.891
Thank you. Listen, buddy, it's late.
I gotta go.

18:16.504 --> 18:18.970
Friendly competition, my ass.

18:23.194 --> 18:24.596
You guys have gotta
be kidding me.

18:24.597 --> 18:27.014
We didn't find a single
connection between our victims?

18:27.015 --> 18:28.566
No, the two were as
different as night and day.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.636
Jason was a retired ex-army doc.

18:30.637 --> 18:32.251
Val was a young
Manhattan ad exec.

18:32.252 --> 18:34.533
Val was born in Florida.
Jason grew up in Iowa.

18:34.534 --> 18:36.087
They didn't share any friends
and they weren't family.

18:36.088 --> 18:39.353
And none of Jason's relatives
recognized Val's photo?

18:39.354 --> 18:40.660
No, and nobody from Val's family

18:40.661 --> 18:42.143
had ever seen or heard of Jason.

18:42.144 --> 18:43.309
We're still looking
through their records,

18:43.310 --> 18:44.403
but so far, nothing.

18:44.404 --> 18:45.492
So we're at a dead end?

18:45.493 --> 18:47.109
Ah, maybe not.

18:47.343 --> 18:48.586
After much reflection,

18:48.587 --> 18:50.021
I realized the key
to solving this

18:50.022 --> 18:52.213
is figuring out the
story on the DVD.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.981
To that end, I crowdsourced

18:53.982 --> 18:57.552
one of the images to my
legion of followers.

18:57.977 --> 18:59.208
And someone recognized it?

18:59.209 --> 19:00.021
Oh, you betcha.

19:00.022 --> 19:02.322
According to bedazzlecats39,

19:02.323 --> 19:04.461
you're looking at
The Brunswick Inn

19:04.462 --> 19:05.903
in Port Campbell.

19:06.871 --> 19:07.791
Bingo.

19:07.792 --> 19:10.207
Val's credit card records show
that she spent a few nights

19:10.208 --> 19:12.733
at The Brunswick Inn
in November 2008.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.525
And it looks like Jason
crashed there, too,

19:14.526 --> 19:16.009
also in November 2008.

19:16.010 --> 19:18.070
Okay, so both of our
victims stayed at that inn

19:18.071 --> 19:19.273
at the same time.

19:19.274 --> 19:21.293
So maybe they were
having an affair.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.372
Well, in 2008, Val
would've been 24.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.736
Jason would've been 66.
An affair would've been...

19:26.737 --> 19:28.312
- Gross.
- I was gonna say unlikely.

19:28.313 --> 19:29.636
It doesn't look like an affair.

19:29.637 --> 19:30.799
They stayed in separate rooms.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.840
Well, the victims
were at the inn.

19:31.841 --> 19:33.975
The inn was on the disc.
There's gotta be a connection.

19:34.161 --> 19:36.182
The inn must be the place

19:36.183 --> 19:39.480
where some unspeakable
horror befell the spirits.

19:39.481 --> 19:40.243
Think about it.

19:40.244 --> 19:42.133
"The Ring," "Psycho,"
"The Shining"...

19:42.134 --> 19:43.669
It's when we get to
the creepy old motel

19:43.670 --> 19:45.969
that everything starts
really going south.

19:45.970 --> 19:48.748
So this must the location of
the spirit's origin story.

19:48.749 --> 19:51.747
Or somehow Val and
Jason connected with

19:51.748 --> 19:53.918
the human killer at that inn.

19:54.075 --> 19:55.186
My version's better.

19:55.187 --> 19:56.786
Why don't you look into
The Brunswick Inn?

19:56.787 --> 19:58.779
See if there any red
flags, past crimes.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.117
Castle and I will
go to Port Campbell

20:00.118 --> 20:01.182
and see what we can find.

20:01.183 --> 20:03.831
Maybe I should... stay here.

20:03.853 --> 20:04.677
I mean,

20:04.678 --> 20:06.450
the inn is just one
piece of the puzzle.

20:06.451 --> 20:09.429
I should really check the
other images on the video,

20:09.430 --> 20:10.855
see what I can figure out.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.194
Whoa. You're volunteering
to watch that thing again?

20:13.195 --> 20:15.514
Yeah.
Not like I can get any deader.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.630
Hello.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.930
It doesn't look like
there's anyone here.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.750
Doesn't look like anyone's
been here this century.

20:41.140 --> 20:44.159
You're not buying into Castle's
spirit craziness, are you?

20:44.160 --> 20:45.389
No.

20:45.390 --> 20:47.889
You think I'm afraid of
some old campfire story?

20:47.890 --> 20:50.470
- I'm a grown-ass man.
- Need help?

20:54.190 --> 20:55.210
Ju-just so you know,

20:55.211 --> 20:58.140
um, that was me being
startled, not scared.

21:00.450 --> 21:01.080
You run this place?

21:01.081 --> 21:03.699
41 years now, but you're
in the wrong place.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.130
We're closed for the season.

21:05.131 --> 21:08.059
We just need to ask
you a few questions.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.569
Uh, do you recognize
these people?

21:10.570 --> 21:13.280
Val Butler and Jason
Bennett... they...

21:13.380 --> 21:15.559
They stayed here back in 2008.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.590
Long time ago, 2008.
Seen a lot of faces come and go.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.850
They would've been
here in November.

21:20.851 --> 21:23.570
Do you remember anything
unusual from that period?

21:24.380 --> 21:27.039
You wouldn't happen to
know their room numbers.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.900
Yeah, uh, 213 and 313.

21:30.550 --> 21:34.440
The 13s.
Those rooms, they're not...

21:34.790 --> 21:36.830
normal rooms.

21:37.260 --> 21:40.990
They're reserved for people involved
in trials at the courthouse,

21:41.420 --> 21:43.399
down at 1135 Elm.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.009
1135, that's the same number as
the PO box on that package.

21:46.010 --> 21:47.188
That's gotta be it, then.

21:47.189 --> 21:48.980
The murders have to be
connected to a trial

21:48.981 --> 21:51.509
held at the courthouse
in November of '08.

21:51.510 --> 21:55.609
There was only one trial
took place in November '08.

21:55.610 --> 21:56.929
It was a terrible thing.

21:56.930 --> 21:58.750
You remember a trial
from five years ago?

21:58.751 --> 22:00.509
No one here can forget.

22:00.510 --> 22:02.420
It was the trial of the century.

22:02.930 --> 22:05.410
That man murdered
half a dozen people.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.090
Who are you talking about?

22:09.800 --> 22:11.650
Nigel Malloy.

22:12.550 --> 22:14.340
The serial killer?

22:14.950 --> 22:16.380
This is all about Nigel Malloy.

22:16.381 --> 22:17.739
It makes perfect sense.

22:17.740 --> 22:19.519
The clock tower from the DVD

22:19.520 --> 22:21.750
it's the same clock tower from the
courthouse where he was tried.

22:21.751 --> 22:23.299
The rooftop and the alley

22:23.300 --> 22:24.550
were the scenes of his
third and fourth murders.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.139
Yeah, and Jason and Val...

22:26.140 --> 22:28.289
both witnesses in his
2008 murder trial.

22:28.290 --> 22:31.129
Okay, so somehow Nigel Malloy
must be taking revenge

22:31.130 --> 22:33.429
against the people that
testified against him.

22:33.430 --> 22:35.420
Uh, yeah, there's
only one problem.

22:35.930 --> 22:37.470
Nigel Malloy is dead.

22:37.830 --> 22:39.990
He died in prison
three years ago.

22:46.570 --> 22:49.189
Nigel Malloy... they called
him "The Grim Reaper."

22:49.190 --> 22:50.330
His signature...

22:50.331 --> 22:52.719
searing symbols like the
ones we saw in the video

22:52.720 --> 22:54.239
into the flesh of his victims.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.169
Turns out that Val and
Jason were witnesses

22:57.170 --> 23:00.069
to the kidnapping of Malloy's
first victim... Esther Alonzo.

23:00.070 --> 23:03.379
He abducted her from an
amusement park in New Jersey.

23:03.380 --> 23:06.599
Tortured her in his basement
for days before killing her.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.560
He had the local police
running around in circles.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.609
They even arrested the wrong guy

23:10.610 --> 23:12.689
before capturing him
five bodies later.

23:12.690 --> 23:14.210
Well, considering
he died in prison,

23:14.211 --> 23:17.499
I'd say he has a pretty good
alibi for our two murders.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.660
It's gotta be someone else.

23:19.110 --> 23:20.509
Don't be so sure.

23:20.510 --> 23:24.409
Take a look at what Nigel Malloy
said in an interview he did...

23:24.410 --> 23:25.890
right before he died.

23:26.210 --> 23:27.839
So, Mr. Malloy,

23:27.840 --> 23:30.649
are you saying you actually
believe you can't die?

23:30.650 --> 23:33.060
My victims gave me unique
insight into death,

23:33.170 --> 23:34.880
into its secrets.

23:35.180 --> 23:38.430
Even when my body perishes,
my essence will continue on.

23:38.690 --> 23:40.590
I will continue on.

23:40.980 --> 23:42.740
You see...

23:43.350 --> 23:45.530
Death is just the beginning.

23:49.430 --> 23:51.860
That guy gives a whole new
meaning to the word "psycho."

23:51.861 --> 23:55.849
What if he did...
find a way to let his spirit live on?

23:55.850 --> 23:57.590
Like the killer in
those Chucky movies

23:57.591 --> 23:59.819
who transferred his spirit
into that spooky doll.

23:59.820 --> 24:03.019
Exactly, only instead
of a doll, it's a DVD.

24:03.020 --> 24:05.010
That explains the message
"You saw, you die."

24:05.011 --> 24:07.569
The witnesses saw his
crimes so they must die.

24:07.570 --> 24:09.208
Well, then given that
logic, we'd both be okay

24:09.209 --> 24:10.420
because we're not witnesses.

24:10.421 --> 24:13.939
But you're a cop.
I'm a cop... helper.

24:13.940 --> 24:16.329
I mean, you don't think a
convicted serial killer

24:16.330 --> 24:18.369
is gonna have an ax to
grind with the NYPD?

24:18.370 --> 24:20.519
Castle, Nigel Malloy
is not involved.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.589
He's dead.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.529
But someone else might
be acting on his behalf.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.398
Ryan, talk to the DA
in Port Campbell.

24:26.399 --> 24:28.678
Let's locate those other witnesses
and make sure they're safe.

24:28.679 --> 24:30.270
- Yeah.
- The court records were sealed.

24:30.271 --> 24:32.429
How would the killer know
who the witnesses were?

24:32.430 --> 24:34.689
Uh, w-wait a minute.

24:34.690 --> 24:37.549
Umm, Nigel Malloy had a brother.
Leopold.

24:37.550 --> 24:40.349
The DA accused him of
helping dispose of the bodies.

24:40.350 --> 24:41.620
Yes, the defense said...

24:41.621 --> 24:44.579
that Nigel had an almost
hypnotic hold over his brother.

24:44.580 --> 24:47.529
He was found not guilty
by reason of insanity,

24:47.530 --> 24:49.230
and they shipped him
off to an asylum.

24:49.231 --> 24:51.339
- Is he still there?
- I am checking.

24:51.340 --> 24:53.279
Ooh, wait. This is interesting.

24:53.280 --> 24:53.919
What?

24:53.920 --> 24:56.919
The asylum that they sent
him to, it's in Greenwich.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.750
That's where Val went the
day she got the DVD.

24:58.751 --> 25:00.690
She went to see Leopold Malloy.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.699
Uh, yes, that young lady did
stop by a few days ago.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.488
Do you have any idea what
they might have talked about

25:09.489 --> 25:10.940
or what he might
have said to her?

25:10.941 --> 25:12.259
I'm afraid not, dear.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.240
You'll have to ask
Mr. Malloy yourself.

25:14.590 --> 25:16.509
You know, not for nothing, but...

25:16.510 --> 25:19.200
what's he like? I mean...

25:19.650 --> 25:22.759
On a scale of 1 to
Hannibal Lecter,

25:22.760 --> 25:24.630
what are we dealing with here?

25:24.900 --> 25:27.199
I'm sorry, but
doctor-patient privilege

25:27.200 --> 25:30.849
prohibits us from characterizing or
describing our patients' behavior.

25:30.850 --> 25:33.109
No, that's okay.
We understand.

25:33.110 --> 25:34.730
Here we are.

25:34.910 --> 25:36.260
Let's go over the rules.

25:36.400 --> 25:39.370
Please don't hand him any objects
or take anything from him.

25:39.500 --> 25:40.948
Don't stand too
close to the glass.

25:40.949 --> 25:41.980
And if you need any help,

25:41.981 --> 25:44.400
just press the red button
on the wall behind you.

25:44.740 --> 25:47.329
Okay, now please just sign here

25:47.330 --> 25:49.500
acknowledging that you
understand the rules.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.280
I feel like I'm
signing my life away.

25:54.770 --> 25:56.320
Well, let's hope not.

26:00.380 --> 26:01.670
Thank you.

26:11.050 --> 26:14.470
Please... have a seat.
I so rarely receive visitors.

26:17.310 --> 26:20.100
But you have received
a visitor recently.

26:21.270 --> 26:24.330
Val Butler.
Why was she here?

26:24.470 --> 26:25.869
Oh, sweet girl.

26:25.870 --> 26:28.149
She came to ask me if
I'd sent her something.

26:28.150 --> 26:29.710
And did you?

26:30.340 --> 26:33.060
How could I?
I can't send anything to anyone.

26:33.210 --> 26:35.510
You could've just gotten someone
else to send it to her,

26:35.511 --> 26:38.200
just like you could've gotten
someone else to kill her.

26:40.110 --> 26:41.990
And why would I do such a thing?

26:43.030 --> 26:46.370
To perpetuate the myth of
your brother's immortality...

26:47.220 --> 26:49.460
Or to avenge his death.

26:51.110 --> 26:55.380
I am not my brother's
keeper, Detective Beckett.

26:57.240 --> 27:00.679
I never was, and I don't share
his murderous impulses.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.609
Yet, you're still in here.

27:03.610 --> 27:04.750
For now.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.808
But when my appeal comes
through, who knows?

27:06.809 --> 27:08.690
We could all meet on
the street one day.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.229
On that day, I might
cross the street.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.840
I'm no danger to anyone.
I never was.

27:15.090 --> 27:19.280
So why would I jeopardize my
appeal by being party to a murder?

27:22.660 --> 27:25.070
Because you knew you
could get away with it.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.380
You're locked up.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.100
You have the perfect alibi.

27:33.860 --> 27:37.499
I have the perfect alibi
because I'm innocent.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.629
I don't have TV or
internet access.

27:39.630 --> 27:42.350
I don't send or receive mail.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.429
The only personal contact I
have is through visitors,

27:45.430 --> 27:48.620
and Val is the last one
I've had in years.

27:48.820 --> 27:51.649
So who could I have
sent to dispatch her

27:51.650 --> 27:53.360
or the other witness?

27:54.920 --> 27:55.838
Uh, well, we never actually

27:55.839 --> 27:58.100
said anything about the
other witness being killed.

27:58.101 --> 28:01.450
So... how would you know
anything about that?

28:05.640 --> 28:07.320
I think it's time for you to go.

28:08.170 --> 28:09.790
I have nothing more to say.

28:14.810 --> 28:16.319
Look, he told us everything.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.570
That slipup proves that he's
been talking with someone

28:18.571 --> 28:19.969
about those murders.

28:19.970 --> 28:22.650
There is one other way he
could've gotten that information.

28:22.950 --> 28:24.298
He could be talking
to his brother.

28:24.299 --> 28:26.438
Castle, he was talking with
someone on the outside.

28:26.439 --> 28:28.180
He hasn't been communing
with the dead.

28:28.181 --> 28:30.280
Well, we can't be sure, and...

28:30.880 --> 28:31.890
we're running out of time.

28:31.891 --> 28:35.470
So I'm gonna scratch off
number 27 on my bucket list.

28:36.330 --> 28:38.669
You remember that, uh,
blue porcelain vase

28:38.670 --> 28:39.898
you had on your
dining room table?

28:39.899 --> 28:41.458
Yeah, the one that
the wind blew over.

28:41.459 --> 28:42.750
Yeah, about that.

28:43.630 --> 28:45.260
I was playing Wii tennis
in the living room...

28:45.261 --> 28:47.510
- You broke my vase?
- Vase.

28:48.170 --> 28:49.868
- Vase is acceptable, too.
- You know what?

28:49.869 --> 28:51.728
You can stop worrying about
the spirits getting to you,

28:51.729 --> 28:53.320
because I just might
kill you myself.

28:53.321 --> 28:56.460
Seriously, you want to spend our
last day on earth fighting?

28:59.650 --> 29:00.338
Ryan.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.550
Hey, we need you to subpoena
records from the asylum.

29:02.551 --> 29:06.299
See who Leopold was in contact
with by phone or over e-mail.

29:06.300 --> 29:10.250
Yeah, sure, but just so you know,
there's been a development.

29:10.510 --> 29:12.300
What do you mean?
What kind of a development?

29:12.301 --> 29:14.920
Well, while looking
into the Malloys,

29:15.050 --> 29:17.069
Nigel's name came up
on a police report.

29:17.070 --> 29:18.580
What kind of a report?

29:19.200 --> 29:22.939
He was, um...
reported missing a few days ago.

29:22.940 --> 29:26.309
Missing? The guy has been
dead for over three years.

29:26.310 --> 29:30.049
Yeah, about that...
the groundskeeper at the cemetery

29:30.050 --> 29:34.060
where Nigel is buried noticed
that his plot has been disturbed.

29:34.510 --> 29:36.059
As in "dug up"?

29:36.060 --> 29:37.549
Well, not just dug up.

29:38.330 --> 29:41.370
Nigel Malloy's body
has disappeared.

29:41.700 --> 29:43.280
It hasn't disappeared.

29:43.780 --> 29:45.760
He's risen from the grave.

29:52.300 --> 29:53.810
All right. Let's hear it.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.540
Hear what?

29:56.700 --> 29:57.908
Your explanation for this.

29:57.909 --> 29:59.350
If there's one thing I
can always count on,

29:59.351 --> 30:01.610
it's you and your logic so...

30:02.800 --> 30:05.820
You want me to explain the dead
serial killer's missing body?

30:11.450 --> 30:13.000
I don't know what happened here

30:13.530 --> 30:14.469
yet.

30:14.470 --> 30:16.299
That's it?
That's all you've got?

30:16.300 --> 30:17.868
But I can assure you that
it has nothing to do

30:17.869 --> 30:19.820
with Nigel Malloy
rising from the dead.

30:19.821 --> 30:21.259
It's his brother.

30:21.260 --> 30:24.100
Leopold Malloy is
behind all of this.

30:25.270 --> 30:25.908
Yo.

30:25.909 --> 30:27.860
It doesn't look like Leopold
has anything to do with this.

30:27.861 --> 30:29.509
No, that can't be right.

30:29.510 --> 30:32.319
Look, the guy's crazy, but he
was right about one thing.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.189
He has no phone, no e-mail,
and no visitors besides Val.

30:35.190 --> 30:38.109
There's gotta be some way of proving
that Leopold's behind all this.

30:38.110 --> 30:39.430
I can't tell you how he did it,

30:39.431 --> 30:41.299
but I can tell you who's next.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.320
I checked into the court
documents on the Malloy trial.

30:43.321 --> 30:45.818
I noticed a pattern.
Jason was the first person to testify,

30:45.819 --> 30:47.370
and he was also the
first one to die.

30:47.371 --> 30:50.019
A day later, Val, the second
person who testified, was killed.

30:50.020 --> 30:52.118
Okay, so they're being killed
in order of their testimonies.

30:52.119 --> 30:53.250
Who's lucky number three?

30:53.251 --> 30:56.080
Uh, Mark Heller.
I talked to his girlfriend.

30:56.330 --> 30:57.879
He received a disc
three days ago.

30:57.880 --> 31:00.509
That means he's due to die tonight
at midnight. That's in four hours.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.748
And where's Mark Heller now?

31:01.749 --> 31:02.758
That's the problem.

31:02.759 --> 31:04.148
He watched the video
and he freaked out.

31:04.149 --> 31:05.678
He left the house.
Nobody knows where he went.

31:05.679 --> 31:07.220
I might.
Heller's financials show that

31:07.221 --> 31:09.759
he bought groceries at a store
outside Kingston yesterday.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.208
His family owns a
cabin up there.

31:11.209 --> 31:12.280
That's probably where
he's holed up.

31:12.281 --> 31:14.569
Okay, Esposito you keep
digging into Leopold.

31:14.570 --> 31:16.719
Ryan...
find the other witnesses.

31:16.720 --> 31:17.950
Make sure they're safe.

31:17.951 --> 31:20.880
Castle and I will head off to Kingston
and see if we can get Heller.

31:22.060 --> 31:25.029
Uh, we're going to a cabin in the
woods in the middle of nowhere?

31:25.030 --> 31:26.209
Yeah. So?

31:26.210 --> 31:28.909
So it's like the co-ed checking out
the strange noise in the basement

31:28.910 --> 31:31.229
in a slasher pic.
It's a recipe for disaster.

31:31.230 --> 31:33.909
It's not a slasher flick.
It's a murder investigation.

31:33.910 --> 31:37.429
And I'm going up to that cabin.
So you coming or what?

31:37.430 --> 31:38.910
Well, I can't let you go alone.

31:40.930 --> 31:42.670
But I need to make a stop first.

31:46.910 --> 31:50.559
Okay, so I've got incense,
palaspas, bagua mirror.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.069
This is a veritable war chest
for fighting evil spirits.

31:53.070 --> 31:54.839
- Is that holy water?
- Yeah.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.148
Where'd you get that from?

31:56.149 --> 31:57.990
A priest blessed this
for me two years ago.

31:57.991 --> 31:59.950
And y-you just keep it around?

32:00.290 --> 32:02.130
Knew it would come
in handy one day.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.310
Now... what weapon do you want?

32:05.890 --> 32:07.810
I think I'll be
fine with my gun.

32:07.930 --> 32:10.609
There's not just one...
tiny part of you

32:10.610 --> 32:12.620
that wonders if I
might be right?

32:20.510 --> 32:22.919
- Hey, Beckett.
- Ryan?

32:22.920 --> 32:25.250
Hey, Beckett?

32:25.920 --> 32:28.879
Ryan, wh... I think
we're in a bad area.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.418
I'm having a hard
time hearing you.

32:30.419 --> 32:31.718
Okay, then I'll make it quick.

32:31.719 --> 32:33.708
I just finished with the last
of the remaining witnesses.

32:33.709 --> 32:34.748
None of them got a disc.

32:34.749 --> 32:37.150
So the killer only targeted
the first three witnesses.

32:37.151 --> 32:40.050
Well, either that or he hasn't
gotten around to the others yet.

32:40.570 --> 32:41.650
Dude, you're breaking up.

32:41.651 --> 32:43.020
Uh, uh, hang on.

32:43.390 --> 32:44.400
Yo, check this out.

32:44.401 --> 32:47.719
Looks like Val, Jason, and Mark
Heller had something else in common.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.459
Hey, Beckett.
We missed something.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.510
I- it's not what we think.
There's someone else.

32:52.430 --> 32:54.030
Beckett? Beckett.

32:56.300 --> 32:58.660
I can't get him back.
I don't have any reception.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.670
There's Heller's car. He's here.

33:07.620 --> 33:09.540
Yeah, I haven't got
any bars either.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.299
Yeah, well, we are in
the middle of nowhere.

33:12.300 --> 33:13.649
Can this get any worse?

33:13.650 --> 33:15.170
A dead serial killer
has gone missing,

33:15.171 --> 33:17.170
we've both seen a cursed disc,

33:17.290 --> 33:19.330
we're at a cabin in the woods
with no cell phone reception...

33:19.331 --> 33:21.700
I don't need Wes Craven
to tell me how this ends.

33:21.790 --> 33:22.930
Well, think about it
this way, Castle.

33:22.931 --> 33:24.749
In all of those horror movies,

33:24.750 --> 33:26.879
- someone survives.
- Yeah, someone.

33:26.880 --> 33:27.959
One of us.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.218
And the other one is cursed
with being charming and funny.

33:30.219 --> 33:31.500
I don't think I need to tell you

33:31.501 --> 33:34.020
what kind of chances the
comic relief guy has.

33:37.970 --> 33:39.630
Mark Heller.

33:41.750 --> 33:43.510
Mark Heller?

33:46.090 --> 33:47.620
Jeez.

33:48.540 --> 33:50.189
Can't say I'm a
fan of the decor.

33:50.190 --> 33:51.560
Yeah, well, neither am I,
but we're just here to...

33:51.561 --> 33:54.310
Unless you leave,
you're gonna die.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.129
Mr. Heller, I'm Detective Beckett.
NYPD.

33:58.130 --> 34:00.110
Well, then you won't
mind showing me ID.

34:05.730 --> 34:07.329
I can't be too cautious,

34:07.330 --> 34:10.049
not with Malloy witnesses
dropping like flies.

34:10.050 --> 34:11.899
Look, we know about the disc.

34:11.900 --> 34:14.429
We're here to take you to the
precinct, where we can protect you.

34:14.699 --> 34:17.438
You can't protect me. He's back.

34:17.440 --> 34:20.580
Look, Mark, if the pattern holds,
you got two minutes before...

34:21.400 --> 34:23.819
you know, so let's talk
about this in the car.

34:23.820 --> 34:27.609
You know, just being in the
same courtroom as Malloy

34:27.610 --> 34:29.768
was enough to make a
grown man wet himself.

34:29.770 --> 34:33.259
Psycho yammering about death and
rebirth and all that hoo-ha.

34:33.260 --> 34:34.800
Okay, hoo-ha we could
be talking about...

34:34.801 --> 34:37.429
You know, neither me
nor Val nor Jason

34:37.429 --> 34:39.929
wanted to testify against
him or the other guy.

34:39.929 --> 34:41.389
What do you mean, the other guy?

34:41.391 --> 34:43.179
Are you talking about Leopold?

34:45.880 --> 34:48.239
- Oh, God.
- Time's up.

34:55.600 --> 34:56.960
It's here.

34:57.260 --> 34:58.978
Do you think it'll matter
that we still have a day left

34:58.979 --> 35:00.668
or will I be like a three
birds with one stone thing?

35:00.669 --> 35:02.070
Where are your circuit breakers?

35:02.071 --> 35:04.650
- Outside by the toolshed.
- Okay.

35:09.950 --> 35:11.010
Someone's out there.

35:11.011 --> 35:13.689
Seriously?
What's it like?

35:13.690 --> 35:16.319
Is it, uh, ghastly,
pale, pissed?

35:16.320 --> 35:18.218
I can't get a good
look at his face.

35:18.219 --> 35:19.148
Do you have a back door?

35:19.149 --> 35:20.580
Yeah, yeah.
Through the kitchen.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.110
Okay, Castle, you
keep an eye on Mark.

35:23.220 --> 35:24.390
I'm gonna head out back,

35:24.391 --> 35:26.849
double around, see if
I can surprise him.

35:26.850 --> 35:28.118
What? Wait. We're splitting up?

35:28.119 --> 35:28.870
Yeah.

35:45.660 --> 35:47.200
NYPD. Hold it right there.

36:04.270 --> 36:06.609
Why can't he just
leave us alone?

36:06.610 --> 36:07.890
We suffered so much already.

36:07.891 --> 36:09.899
The guilt nearly killed
the three of us.

36:09.900 --> 36:12.750
Why would you have guilt about
getting a serial killer convicted?

36:13.960 --> 36:16.030
Because that's not
the whole story.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.280
We all have blood on our hands.

36:21.200 --> 36:22.649
Blood? What blood?

36:22.650 --> 36:24.609
Mark, talk to me.
I need to know.

36:24.610 --> 36:26.309
What blood is on your hands?

36:26.310 --> 36:29.609
What does it matter? He's come back
for us. We're all gonna die.

36:29.610 --> 36:31.330
It matters because if you
did something wrong,

36:31.331 --> 36:33.820
it could be the key to
getting out of this alive.

36:42.630 --> 36:44.460
Get off of me! Let me go!

36:46.980 --> 36:49.730
You? Leopold's nurse.

36:50.270 --> 36:52.539
- Leopold. It was you.
- No.

36:52.540 --> 36:53.619
No. No.

36:53.620 --> 36:56.089
- You're the one that's killing for him.
- No, no.

36:56.090 --> 36:57.370
You don't understand.

36:57.371 --> 36:59.929
That's how he got to the witnesses.
He was using you.

36:59.930 --> 37:01.449
You don't get it.

37:01.450 --> 37:03.868
I'm not here to kill Heller.
I'm here to save him.

37:03.869 --> 37:05.298
What are you even talking about?

37:05.299 --> 37:06.898
- That's why Leopold sent me.
- Step back.

37:06.899 --> 37:08.860
- Okay. Okay. All right.
- Step back.

37:09.570 --> 37:12.010
He knew that people would think
that he was behind the murders,

37:12.520 --> 37:15.230
and then he wouldn't be able
to get out of the asylum.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.489
I love him.
I was just trying to protect him.

37:19.490 --> 37:20.930
We knew we had to
stop the murders.

37:20.931 --> 37:23.900
It... it's not us. I swear.

37:24.980 --> 37:26.380
If it's not you, then who is it?

37:26.381 --> 37:30.110
I don't know, but I went to
Nigel's grave just to be sure.

37:30.420 --> 37:34.380
I dug it up. He was gone.

37:36.670 --> 37:40.270
No. Evil spirits don't kill.

37:40.390 --> 37:42.060
People do.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.649
Before Nigel, the police
arrested someone else...

37:46.650 --> 37:48.189
David Collier.

37:48.190 --> 37:50.409
Guy had a history
of mental illness.

37:50.410 --> 37:54.270
Me, Val, and Jason had to
pick him out of a lineup.

37:54.570 --> 37:56.850
None of us were sure,
but the police, they...

37:57.680 --> 38:00.200
They pressured you into
saying it was Collier.

38:02.730 --> 38:04.210
What happened to him?

38:04.700 --> 38:08.640
He couldn't take it... the accusations,
what people were saying.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.839
He smashed a lightbulb
in his cell

38:10.840 --> 38:13.690
and he used the wire to
electrocute himself.

38:14.490 --> 38:16.210
So his heart stopped.

38:17.390 --> 38:19.909
When did he die?
Mark, exactly when did he die?

38:19.910 --> 38:21.910
At midnight, third night
he was in prison.

38:22.340 --> 38:24.999
"You saw midnight third day,
you die."

38:25.000 --> 38:27.600
This isn't about Nigel.
It's about Collier.

38:28.560 --> 38:32.249
Mark, you gotta think.
Did he have any friends, any relatives?

38:32.250 --> 38:35.060
Yeah, he had a daughter. Amanda.

38:35.450 --> 38:37.690
Val's roommate's name is Amanda.

38:40.510 --> 38:42.070
Someone's here.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.460
Your three days are up, Mark.

38:55.560 --> 38:58.660
The same three days of
fear my father had.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.480
Stop... right there.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.600
Right in my eyes!

39:22.170 --> 39:25.020
- The gun!
- I can't see. Where is she?

39:27.290 --> 39:29.340
This is for my father.

39:30.080 --> 39:31.610
Castle!

39:35.500 --> 39:36.980
See?

39:37.410 --> 39:39.810
Told you this holy water
would come in handy.

39:43.230 --> 39:46.479
So according to
Amanda's psych records,

39:46.480 --> 39:49.409
she suffered a mental
break about a year ago.

39:49.410 --> 39:52.149
That must be when she started
fixating on revenge.

39:52.150 --> 39:55.809
Planning to punish all those
who wrongly ID'ed her dad.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.350
You know, she must
have cozied up to Val

39:57.351 --> 39:59.949
to find out where
Jason and Mark were.

39:59.950 --> 40:02.959
And...
she used this to knock them out.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.149
The mug?

40:04.150 --> 40:07.239
No, the taser.
It's a modified taser.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.899
It emits a disorienting light
and amplified voltage.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.639
Enough voltage to stop a heart.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.540
And make the facial
muscles contract.

40:13.541 --> 40:16.249
I guess Amanda wanted the people
responsible for her father's death

40:16.250 --> 40:17.969
to suffer the same way he did.

40:17.970 --> 40:19.919
So three days of fear

40:19.920 --> 40:22.769
capped up with a dark,
heart-stopping death.

40:22.770 --> 40:24.260
Yeah, but how did she get
the power to go out?

40:24.261 --> 40:25.550
She used this.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.800
She attached it to the
cabin's circuit breaker.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.609
It emits a magnetic charge

40:30.610 --> 40:32.720
that interferes with the system.

40:33.530 --> 40:37.249
So... I guess that there is a
logical explanation for everything.

40:37.250 --> 40:39.809
Oh, I don't know.
What about Nigel?

40:39.810 --> 40:41.788
How did his body go
missing from his grave?

40:41.789 --> 40:42.950
I can answer that.

40:42.951 --> 40:45.119
Turns out he was never buried.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.499
His body disappeared from the
morgue shortly after his death.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.210
The police didn't want
to make it known,

40:50.211 --> 40:52.319
so they buried an empty coffin.

40:52.320 --> 40:55.960
But here's the odd thing...
his body was never found.

40:56.260 --> 41:00.490
So...
he could still be out there...

41:00.690 --> 41:02.020
somewhere.

41:10.270 --> 41:13.590
Okay, so...
here's to a job well done.

41:15.520 --> 41:19.260
And now you can finally get
rid of this bucket... list

41:19.510 --> 41:20.850
of yours.

41:21.230 --> 41:22.460
What's that look for?

41:22.461 --> 41:24.419
"Be with Kate"?

41:24.420 --> 41:26.330
That's your number one?
When did you write this?

41:26.331 --> 41:27.980
What, like three years ago?

41:28.650 --> 41:30.220
I can cross that one off.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.670
Sorry.
Still one minute till midnight.

41:39.671 --> 41:41.059
Are you serious, Castle?

41:41.060 --> 41:43.379
Yes, I'm serious.
I'm not taking any chances.

41:43.380 --> 41:45.599
This is one deadline
I want to miss.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.490
You know, you're right.

41:46.491 --> 41:48.709
It would be a shame if
something happened to us

41:48.710 --> 41:51.209
because there's one
thing on my bucket list

41:51.210 --> 41:53.060
that I would like to accomplish.

41:53.410 --> 41:55.640
And it involves a little
trick that I do...

41:56.140 --> 41:57.909
with ice.

41:57.910 --> 42:00.390
See, now that definitely
sounds worth living for.

42:02.290 --> 42:05.469
Hey, Castle...
the ice is melting.

42:05.470 --> 42:07.860
Okay, ju... I just... in...

42:08.140 --> 42:10.270
Three, two...

42:12.341 --> 42:17.341
