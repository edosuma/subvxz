you are guaranteed a quiet life.

00:17.293 --> 00:19.524
The safest place on earth.

00:20.242 --> 00:23.717
In Fortitude, you have to be able
to provide for yourself. Everyone

00:23.807 --> 00:26.007
has got a job, so there is no crime.

00:26.428 --> 00:28.228
Everybody is always happy.

00:29.264 --> 00:32.540
While you are here, you will
need your own rifle and a hat.

00:32.603 --> 00:34.763
Something groovy with ear flaps.

00:37.192 --> 00:39.811
I am required to ask you if
you feel safe in Fortitude?

00:39.846 --> 00:41.135
Hmm mmm.

00:41.170 --> 00:42.414
Are you seeing anybody?

00:42.454 --> 00:45.174
(LAUGHS) Is that an official question?

00:46.144 --> 00:47.496
Where did you get this?

00:47.585 --> 00:48.662
I found a carcass.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.346
There is an entire carcass?

00:50.457 --> 00:51.576
What is it worth?

00:51.654 --> 00:52.868
It is priceless.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.045
Hello?! Hello?!

00:59.222 --> 01:01.582
We have a very serious problem here.

01:02.418 --> 01:04.562
Did you see Charlie before he died?

01:04.596 --> 01:06.924
He found something precious.

01:08.060 --> 01:10.048
Is this what got him killed?

01:11.787 --> 01:13.485
I want you to take this to your labratory.

01:13.550 --> 01:14.510
Run tests on it.

01:15.520 --> 01:19.295
DCI Morton can provide
invaluable analytical skills.

01:19.365 --> 01:20.325
We have skills.

01:21.504 --> 01:24.489
You know, nothing buried
in permafrost ever decays.

01:24.565 --> 01:27.565
This place is a forensic treasure house.

01:29.398 --> 01:31.472
It's not that I can't forgive you...

01:31.604 --> 01:34.944
It's that you are not my man anymore.

01:35.124 --> 01:39.227
In this place, things can
come at you from nowhere.

01:39.660 --> 01:40.980
What kind of things?

01:41.277 --> 01:42.625
Monsters.

01:45.508 --> 01:48.743
It's happened again, Doctor
Allardyce has been attacked.

01:48.813 --> 01:50.614
And Shirley is missing.

01:50.649 --> 01:54.140
I think there is something
very bad going on in this place.

01:55.915 --> 01:58.345
This bear attacked and
devoured another adult male...

01:58.451 --> 02:00.521
We don't see that happen, it is psychotic.

02:00.615 --> 02:01.873
What are you proposing?

02:01.908 --> 02:05.814
The tests I carried out, I want to
do the same with Shirley Allardyce.

02:06.110 --> 02:07.605
If we find what we are looking for,

02:07.678 --> 02:10.398
then that means it is
not safe to live here.

02:11.295 --> 02:13.758
We cannot let fear take hold.

02:13.842 --> 02:14.919
I would never hurt you.

02:14.984 --> 02:17.264
I would kill anybody that hurt you.

02:18.201 --> 02:19.610
Are we looking at a virus here?

02:19.645 --> 02:20.362
No.

02:20.397 --> 02:22.152
What is causing this?

02:22.217 --> 02:25.138
Prehistoric frozen wasp thaws.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.254
Wasp injects eggs into human blood stream.

02:28.377 --> 02:30.603
The host is compelled to find a victim.

02:32.730 --> 02:35.442
Don't open the door. We
can't let these things out.

02:35.504 --> 02:36.987
We will have to kill them all.

02:42.943 --> 02:45.498
Everyone in Fortitude could be infected.

02:45.964 --> 02:48.959
I need you to tell me where
the mammoth can be found.
