03:14.529 --> 03:16.596
- I forgot to tell you.
- Mm.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.867
Kelly got a job today

03:19.199 --> 03:20.631
at a coffee shop.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.736
I thought she was coming
home for the summer.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.605
<i>Well she changed her mind.</i>

03:27.375 --> 03:29.208
She's moving in with some friends.

03:34.281 --> 03:36.114
<i>It's not about that, John.</i>

03:40.320 --> 03:42.153
She had a gun to her head.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.790
She doesn't blame you.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.066
I want to show you something.

04:18.658 --> 04:21.067
And Black flies?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.494
Brutal little mothers.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.063
You gotta stop eating candy, bro.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.798
<i>They like the sweet stuff.</i>

04:26.834 --> 04:28.433
Yeah? Why aren't they all over you,

04:28.468 --> 04:29.667
Mr. Nice Guy?

04:30.137 --> 04:32.838
They can smell my bitterness
from a mile away.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.505
<i>She's totally out of it!</i>

04:37.177 --> 04:38.376
<i>Wow.</i>

04:42.182 --> 04:44.181
<i>We're going to have a good time, huh.</i>

04:44.517 --> 04:45.683
<i>Can we get a tequila?</i>

04:45.719 --> 04:47.250
<i>Double shot?</i>

04:47.275 --> 04:48.374
<i>Blaine.</i>

04:48.401 --> 04:49.568
The redhead.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.022
What's she drinking?

04:52.058 --> 04:53.791
The guy over there bought her a beer.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.025
She didn't drink it.

05:07.406 --> 05:08.505
<i>Leave her alone.</i>

05:08.540 --> 05:09.506
Back off, buddy.

05:09.541 --> 05:10.741
<i>Shut up.</i>

05:12.711 --> 05:14.711
<i>Miss, are you okay?</i>

05:17.148 --> 05:18.815
I don't know.

05:18.851 --> 05:20.283
Do you know what day is it?

05:20.318 --> 05:21.618
<i>I said back off.</i>

05:21.653 --> 05:22.853
Um...

05:23.555 --> 05:25.389
<i>Do you know where you are?</i>

05:28.026 --> 05:29.993
<i>Hey, Chief.</i>

05:30.028 --> 05:31.995
Why don't you get out of
here before I kick your ass.

05:32.030 --> 05:33.229
Oh, yeah?

05:39.070 --> 05:40.303
Miss.

05:40.866 --> 05:42.705
Do you have a purse on you?

05:42.740 --> 05:44.374
A phone?

05:45.944 --> 05:47.377
I don't think so.

05:50.581 --> 05:51.781
Hey!

05:53.918 --> 05:56.752
Does anyone in here
know who this lady is?

05:57.855 --> 05:59.688
I thought she was just being nice.

06:01.225 --> 06:02.491
<i>Miss.</i>

06:02.527 --> 06:04.993
<i>I'm gonna take you to some place safe.</i>

06:05.029 --> 06:06.861
<i>If that's okay with you.</i>

06:07.764 --> 06:08.964
Sure.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.492
I don't want to sell our house.

06:25.228 --> 06:27.444
We've been talking about
a place on the water

06:27.479 --> 06:28.478
ever since we came up.

06:28.503 --> 06:29.702
Some day.

06:33.082 --> 06:35.449
My thirty's coming up in September.

06:35.485 --> 06:38.418
Sure and then it'll be your thirty-five,

06:38.453 --> 06:39.519
and then your forty.

06:39.554 --> 06:40.921
<i>Catherine.</i>

06:40.956 --> 06:42.155
I was thinking

06:43.425 --> 06:45.025
that I might actually...

06:45.060 --> 06:47.060
I don't think we should
look too far ahead.

06:53.435 --> 06:54.634
There.

06:56.571 --> 06:57.770
Perfect!

07:16.691 --> 07:17.923
Cardinal.

07:24.833 --> 07:26.233
I was on a date.

07:27.454 --> 07:28.652
Ah.

07:29.503 --> 07:30.702
Sorry.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.937
He spent the whole time explaining

07:32.973 --> 07:35.006
how prosecution works.

07:35.042 --> 07:36.675
He was probably nervous.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.181
These are detectives Cardinal and Delorme

07:42.216 --> 07:44.182
from the Algonquin Bay Police Department.

07:44.217 --> 07:46.186
They'll be taking over
the case from here.

07:46.211 --> 07:47.354
<i>Okay, well,</i>

07:47.379 --> 07:50.121
<i>the bullet entered the
victim's left temporal lobe.</i>

07:50.157 --> 07:52.053
Lodged near the hippocampus.

07:52.054 --> 07:54.254
So lobotomy by gunshot.

07:54.289 --> 07:56.523
<i>That would explain her placid mood.</i>

07:56.559 --> 07:58.525
What's her condition?

07:58.561 --> 08:00.626
The bullet's close to a cerebral artery.

08:00.662 --> 08:02.462
Based on her EEG...

08:02.497 --> 08:04.597
one or two strong seizures

08:04.632 --> 08:06.066
and she's dead.

08:07.373 --> 08:09.373
<i>They're assembling a
trauma team in Toronto.</i>

08:10.511 --> 08:12.183
- Can we see her?
- <i>Mmm hmm.</i>

08:13.141 --> 08:14.441
<i>- Thanks.</i>
- Thanks.

08:14.476 --> 08:15.675
<i>All right, thank you.</i>

08:16.644 --> 08:18.478
So, I've been calling her "Red"

08:18.513 --> 08:19.912
because I don't think that Jane Doe

08:19.948 --> 08:22.047
is appropriate for a living victim.

08:22.083 --> 08:23.215
Is she local?

08:23.250 --> 08:24.917
Nobody recognized her in the bar

08:24.953 --> 08:26.953
and I ran her picture
against our missing persons

08:26.988 --> 08:28.187
and no hits.

08:30.157 --> 08:32.157
No, ah, cell phone? Purse?

08:32.193 --> 08:33.325
Just the clothes on her back

08:33.361 --> 08:35.059
and judging by the leaves
and the dirt and everything,

08:35.096 --> 08:36.962
she had to be out in the bush for a while

08:36.998 --> 08:38.397
before she went into the bar.

08:38.432 --> 08:39.631
Huh.

08:43.703 --> 08:44.936
<i>Hi.</i>

08:45.306 --> 08:46.972
<i>I'm Detective Cardinal.</i>

08:47.008 --> 08:48.636
<i>This is Detective Delorme.</i>

08:49.543 --> 08:50.775
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

08:52.345 --> 08:53.578
Great.

08:53.614 --> 08:54.813
How are you?

08:55.849 --> 08:57.248
<i>Um...</i>

08:57.283 --> 09:00.585
<i>There's a helicopter that's
going to take you to a hospital</i>

09:00.621 --> 09:01.586
<i>in Toronto.</i>

09:01.622 --> 09:02.821
Why?

09:04.194 --> 09:05.278
I feel fine.

09:06.905 --> 09:07.791
Ah...

09:08.990 --> 09:10.995
Well, because you have a bullet

09:11.031 --> 09:12.363
lodged in your brain

09:12.399 --> 09:14.399
and the doctors want to take it out.

09:15.301 --> 09:16.501
Oh.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.282
Okay.

09:20.473 --> 09:22.507
Ah, can you help us with something.

09:22.542 --> 09:24.041
We'd like to go through your clothing,

09:24.076 --> 09:26.443
see if there's any identification.

09:26.478 --> 09:27.678
<i>Sure.</i>

09:29.314 --> 09:31.148
Ah, do you mind if I take your photo?

09:34.319 --> 09:35.719
Is my hair crazy?

09:38.490 --> 09:39.689
No.

09:45.164 --> 09:46.996
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

09:47.529 --> 09:49.155
who might have done this to you?

09:52.538 --> 09:53.736
Done what?

09:56.675 --> 09:58.708
Looks like you're ready to go.

09:58.743 --> 09:59.943
Come on.

10:01.245 --> 10:04.254
And I will meet you in Toronto.

10:06.350 --> 10:07.850
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:07.886 --> 10:09.085
Bye.

<i>Bone lifter.</i>

11:00.852 --> 11:02.228

11:49.818 --> 11:50.850
<i>So many flies.</i>

11:52.387 --> 11:54.387
<i>We need you to stay very still now.</i>

11:57.118 --> 11:58.717
Is this a dream or a memory?

11:58.859 --> 12:00.526
<i>Could be either.</i>

12:00.562 --> 12:02.562
<i>But she'll have no context for any of it.</i>

<i>There.</i>

Pointing.

Over there.

12:12.048 --> 12:13.772
Moons.

12:13.808 --> 12:15.677
<i>Almost there.</i>

12:16.577 --> 12:18.010
Is there anyone with you?

12:19.513 --> 12:20.913
I can't hear.

12:23.017 --> 12:24.416
The hissing.

12:29.656 --> 12:31.856
You have such beautiful eyes.

12:31.891 --> 12:33.325
<i>Got it.</i>

12:54.447 --> 12:55.679
<i>Sponge.</i>

13:28.128 --> 13:29.327
<i>You're in early.</i>

13:30.130 --> 13:31.896
Yeah, I was here last night, too.

13:31.931 --> 13:32.897
<i>Where were you?</i>

13:32.932 --> 13:34.132
Work.

13:35.969 --> 13:37.469
<i>Are you leading the class tonight?</i>

13:37.504 --> 13:39.337
Depends on work, but yeah.

13:40.173 --> 13:42.006
Can I show you something?

13:43.309 --> 13:44.441
<i>Do you know her?</i>

13:44.477 --> 13:45.877
<i>Maybe from school?</i>

13:46.545 --> 13:47.779
I don't think so.

13:48.047 --> 13:50.748
What about hanging around
the Northern Raiders?

13:50.784 --> 13:51.916
<i>Your biker friends.</i>

13:51.951 --> 13:53.517
I haven't been around them in six months.

13:53.552 --> 13:54.786
But I don't know her.

13:56.289 --> 13:57.621
Hey, if you're walking alone,

13:57.657 --> 14:00.624
just beware of your surroundings, okay?

14:00.660 --> 14:02.125
No headphones.

14:02.161 --> 14:03.794
You don't think I can handle myself?

14:04.563 --> 14:06.530
I know you can.

14:06.565 --> 14:08.399
Just be careful.

14:14.372 --> 14:15.772
Plain, unjacketed, lead,

14:15.808 --> 14:17.340
thirty-two caliber bullet.

14:17.375 --> 14:18.474
And it looks to me like a

14:18.510 --> 14:19.776
thirty-two long.

14:19.812 --> 14:21.311
See normally with a head shot,

14:21.346 --> 14:23.680
you'd expect the bullet to mushroom

14:23.715 --> 14:25.015
and look here,

14:25.050 --> 14:27.117
<i>it's almost intact.</i>

14:27.152 --> 14:29.186
Now old or waterlogged maybe.

14:29.221 --> 14:31.387
That's why it didn't kill her.

14:31.423 --> 14:32.822
<i>Six right-hand grooves,</i>

14:32.857 --> 14:35.625
<i>with a land groove ratio
of one-to-one-plus.</i>

14:35.660 --> 14:37.493
Grooves are zero point five-six;

14:37.529 --> 14:39.395
lands are zero point six-oh.

14:39.431 --> 14:40.463
Pistol.

14:40.498 --> 14:42.998
The rifling on the weapon
has a left-hand twist.

14:43.034 --> 14:44.667
That narrows it down
to two possibilities:

14:44.703 --> 14:46.202
a J.C. Higgins model 80,

14:46.237 --> 14:48.370
or a Colt Police Positive.

14:48.405 --> 14:49.604
That helps.

14:50.441 --> 14:53.275
There are hundreds of these in Ontario.

14:59.050 --> 15:00.883
<i>Our redhead have a name yet?</i>

15:01.418 --> 15:02.384
No prints in the system.

15:02.419 --> 15:03.618
In Canada.

15:04.921 --> 15:05.887
We're working our way

15:05.922 --> 15:07.556
through the individual state databases.

15:09.426 --> 15:10.693
No one's reported her missing?

15:10.728 --> 15:11.713
Not yet.

15:11.748 --> 15:12.994
<i>We still have hours of bus station</i>

15:13.029 --> 15:14.629
and airport footage to go through.

15:15.065 --> 15:16.431
You don't think she's local?

15:16.467 --> 15:17.699
We don't know.

15:19.535 --> 15:21.169
<i>Healthy, perfect teeth.</i>

15:21.204 --> 15:23.004
She wasn't living on the streets.

15:23.039 --> 15:24.172
If she's local,

15:24.207 --> 15:26.207
someone would have reported
her missing by now.

15:46.061 --> 15:47.461
How ya feeling?

15:49.799 --> 15:52.560
Sorry, do I know you?

15:55.437 --> 15:57.037
I'm Detective Cardinal.

15:57.072 --> 15:59.472
We met in Algonquin Bay.

15:59.942 --> 16:02.776
They're gonna transfer you
back up there tomorrow.

16:02.811 --> 16:04.244
Then I can go home?

16:05.580 --> 16:07.414
<i>Any idea where that might be?</i>

16:09.684 --> 16:11.684
I was hoping that you knew.

16:15.857 --> 16:17.290
Get some rest.

16:29.103 --> 16:30.069
<i>Great.</i>

16:30.104 --> 16:31.703
Yes. Okay, thank you.

16:32.173 --> 16:33.372
Yeah, thank you.

16:34.275 --> 16:36.342
I found a witness.

16:36.377 --> 16:38.644
Says he saw a truck drop off Red

16:38.679 --> 16:40.112
at the World Tavern last night.

16:40.148 --> 16:42.614
And he remembers the make,
model and plate number?

16:42.650 --> 16:44.616
He remembered it was a grocery truck.

16:44.652 --> 16:46.614
Fruit painted all over it.

16:47.655 --> 16:49.287
I tracked down the driver.

16:49.323 --> 16:50.422
He's local?

16:50.458 --> 16:51.423
Mmm-hmm.

16:51.459 --> 16:53.291
He's on his way in.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.434
<i>You picked her up southbound Highway 11?</i>

17:02.469 --> 17:03.468
Yeah.

17:03.503 --> 17:04.469
She was wandering.

17:04.503 --> 17:06.838
I thought maybe she was drunk.

17:06.873 --> 17:09.040
She didn't flag you for a ride?

17:09.076 --> 17:11.513
You saw her and you pulled over.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.112
<i>I don't usually pick up hitchhikers.</i>

17:15.146 --> 17:16.981
But she caught your eye.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.017
I have three daughters.

17:20.051 --> 17:22.152
I'd like to think that if one
of them was lost out there...

17:22.188 --> 17:24.021
<i>What made you think she was lost?</i>

17:25.223 --> 17:27.156
<i>She didn't know her name.</i>

17:27.193 --> 17:29.694
Didn't know where she'd been,
where she was going.

17:29.729 --> 17:32.129
So you dropped her off at a roadside bar.

17:32.164 --> 17:33.953
Instead of here

17:34.266 --> 17:35.621
or the hospital.

17:36.768 --> 17:38.168
She saw the World Tavern,

17:38.204 --> 17:39.370
said to drop her off there.

17:39.405 --> 17:40.371
What am I gonna do?

17:40.406 --> 17:42.406
Keep her prisoner in my cab?

17:45.544 --> 17:47.011
So you were worried
enough to pick her up,

17:47.046 --> 17:49.713
but not enough to take
her somewhere safe?

17:49.748 --> 17:50.947
It's not...

17:52.350 --> 17:54.350
I started thinking it was a scam.

17:59.858 --> 18:01.858
Ah, maybe I do want to call a lawyer.

18:18.359 --> 18:20.192
Is she a lumberjack?

18:23.797 --> 18:25.630
Okay, how old is she?

18:26.126 --> 18:28.674
Twenties. Five four, a
hundred and twenty pounds.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.371
Hey Dad, we're not shopping for
your girlfriend here are we?

18:36.023 --> 18:37.222
Who is she?

18:37.911 --> 18:40.378
Just tell me. I-I won't say anything.

18:40.413 --> 18:42.413
She's someone who needs my help.

18:50.857 --> 18:52.857
I'm staying here 'cause I like it.

18:52.892 --> 18:53.858
Not because of what happened.

19:01.567 --> 19:03.000
She needs pants.

19:04.336 --> 19:06.003
- We have a suspect yet?
- Got it.

19:06.038 --> 19:08.338
Forensics is going through the truck.

19:08.374 --> 19:09.573
Nothing yet.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.375
And his story checks out.

19:11.410 --> 19:13.910
I don't think he's our guy.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.812
I sent you Venn's, uh,

19:15.847 --> 19:17.414
preliminary firearms report. Have you...

19:17.449 --> 19:19.683
<i>Yeah, I pulled a
list of registered owners</i>

19:19.718 --> 19:21.752
<i>matching the two gun types.</i>

19:21.787 --> 19:23.353
<i>We've got six in town.</i>

19:23.389 --> 19:25.489
I thought I'd start with these before

19:25.524 --> 19:27.255
working my way further out.

19:27.256 --> 19:28.521
How's Red?

19:28.557 --> 19:31.324
Ah, she forgets who I am
every time I leave the room.

19:31.359 --> 19:33.927
I'm shopping for clothing for her now.

19:33.962 --> 19:35.962
As if she hasn't been through enough.

19:37.866 --> 19:39.265
Hey, is that Mom?

19:41.135 --> 19:42.569
I gotta call ya back.

19:43.438 --> 19:44.636
Yeah.

20:33.253 --> 20:34.318
Do you have a minute?

20:34.353 --> 20:35.586
What's up?

20:36.623 --> 20:38.255
I want to apply for training

20:38.290 --> 20:40.124
with the National Intelligence Service.

20:41.260 --> 20:43.093
I need your letter of recommendation.

20:45.097 --> 20:46.497
You're not happy here?

20:47.634 --> 20:49.400
I want to keep my options open.

20:49.435 --> 20:52.436
Well, the timing couldn't be worse.

20:53.736 --> 20:55.472
The interviews start in a few days.

20:55.508 --> 20:56.706
Mmm hmm.

20:58.844 --> 21:01.412
You've only been here for six months.

21:01.952 --> 21:04.281
Why should I pick you over anyone else?

21:06.685 --> 21:09.418
You need detectives
committed to being the best.

21:12.123 --> 21:13.957
Have you talked to Cardinal?

21:16.127 --> 21:17.527
He won't mind.

21:39.150 --> 21:40.549
It's summer, isn't it?

21:41.986 --> 21:43.185
Yeah.

21:44.453 --> 21:46.021
Anything coming back to you?

21:52.162 --> 21:53.562
Where are we going?

21:54.865 --> 21:56.264
Algonquin Bay.

21:57.867 --> 22:00.668
Am I coming home with you?

22:00.704 --> 22:01.903
<i>No.</i>

22:02.406 --> 22:05.933
No, we have a private room
for you at a hospital.

22:06.276 --> 22:07.909
And a neuropsychologist who will help you

22:07.944 --> 22:09.777
get your memory back.

22:12.116 --> 22:13.547
Do I like him?

22:14.817 --> 22:16.650
I don't think you've met him.

22:19.355 --> 22:20.755
We'll have fun.

22:44.212 --> 22:45.612
<i>What do you think I did?</i>

22:48.150 --> 22:53.253
I mean, to get shot in the head?

22:53.288 --> 22:56.289
What makes you think it
was something you did?

23:30.191 --> 23:31.423
What're you doing?

23:31.659 --> 23:33.425
Yeah, I thought you were drowning.

23:33.460 --> 23:34.593
Drowning?

23:34.628 --> 23:36.027
I'll drown you!

23:38.465 --> 23:39.864
You're such a jerk!

23:42.769 --> 23:43.968
Oh, I'm so sorry.

23:44.637 --> 23:45.837
Hey!

23:46.639 --> 23:47.739
I'm going into town.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.473
Come on.

23:49.509 --> 23:50.709
All right.

23:51.845 --> 23:52.811
<i>Shotgun!</i>

23:52.846 --> 23:54.179
<i>Aw, you suck!</i>

23:54.214 --> 23:55.246
You can pick the music Toof.

23:55.281 --> 23:56.314
<i>What? No, no!</i>

23:56.349 --> 23:58.115
<i>I'll-I'll let him take the front.</i>

23:58.150 --> 23:59.417
Kev, I love ya man.

23:59.452 --> 24:01.252
But your music is shit.

24:01.287 --> 24:02.587
Yeah, it brings me down.

24:02.622 --> 24:04.021
You guys have no taste.

24:04.790 --> 24:05.989
<i>Here.</i>

24:06.025 --> 24:08.859
I don't want your wet asses on my seats.

24:39.486 --> 24:41.319
I think you'll like this place.

24:43.723 --> 24:44.922
<i>Come on in.</i>

24:46.993 --> 24:48.226
Lise Delorme.

24:49.896 --> 24:51.096
<i>You're next.</i>

24:51.931 --> 24:53.965
Jordan Akiwenzie.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.734
He's got way too many
schemes going on in his head.

24:56.769 --> 24:58.769
Needs a place to channel that energy.

25:01.641 --> 25:03.474
Can I talk to you?

25:11.157 --> 25:13.157
I don't mind helping out,

25:13.452 --> 25:16.052
but I can't commit to
being here all the time.

25:16.088 --> 25:17.921
- Of course not.
- No.

25:17.956 --> 25:19.156
But when you are here,

25:19.191 --> 25:21.024
you're a rock star.

25:22.337 --> 25:23.793
I'm leaving Jordan here.

25:33.839 --> 25:35.038
<i>And time.</i>

25:45.083 --> 25:46.515
Ever boxed before?

25:48.353 --> 25:49.785
I know how to fight.

25:54.410 --> 25:57.126
<i>So, uh, I'm just wondering
if you've made your decision</i>

25:57.162 --> 25:58.517
about NIS.

25:58.553 --> 26:00.363
The interviews start on Thursday.

26:02.580 --> 26:04.580
I've decided to go with someone else.

26:05.383 --> 26:06.782
Oh yeah? Who?

26:16.013 --> 26:17.379
<i>I've managed to eliminate</i>

26:17.414 --> 26:20.215
<i>two owners of the gun
types we're looking at.</i>

26:20.250 --> 26:21.683
How many province wide?

26:23.353 --> 26:24.952
Two hundred ninety-seven.

26:24.988 --> 26:26.854
That's only the registered ones.

26:26.890 --> 26:28.790
Well let's hope it's registered.

26:28.825 --> 26:30.024
And local.

26:30.827 --> 26:33.662
Dyson recommended you for
NIS training, didn't she?

26:35.999 --> 26:36.964
I've been here six years.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.399
You've been here what?

26:39.268 --> 26:40.702
Why'd she pick you?

26:41.404 --> 26:42.837
I'm sleeping with her.

26:49.846 --> 26:51.512
Intelligence and analysis.

26:51.547 --> 26:53.547
- Is that what you...
- That's what came up.

26:58.221 --> 26:59.820
<i>Six months away.</i>

26:59.855 --> 27:00.987
Seems like a good idea.

27:01.023 --> 27:02.423
It's a good career move.

27:04.607 --> 27:05.807
<i>John.</i>

27:07.510 --> 27:09.776
I knew you wouldn't have time
to come home and change.

27:09.925 --> 27:10.890
Oh, thanks.

27:10.915 --> 27:12.314
- Hi Lise.
- Hi.

27:14.220 --> 27:17.570
Uh, I won't keep you but, ah,
guess who has 12 students

27:17.606 --> 27:18.571
signed up for Toronto.

27:18.607 --> 27:20.006
- When do you leave?
- Friday.

27:20.042 --> 27:21.842
And I got a million
things to do before then so,

27:21.877 --> 27:23.076
I better run.

27:23.118 --> 27:24.550
<i>- See you for dinner?
- Yeah.</i>

27:41.729 --> 27:44.296
You know what a long shot this is.

27:44.331 --> 27:45.765
The shooter and the gun

27:45.800 --> 27:47.867
could be in Calgary by now.

27:47.902 --> 27:49.301
Where to next?

27:50.692 --> 27:52.525
3675 Spencer Road.

27:58.805 --> 28:00.439
Catherine looked happy.

28:01.572 --> 28:02.771
She is.

28:16.019 --> 28:17.820
<i>- Come on in.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

28:17.855 --> 28:20.722
I, uh, inherited it from my grandfather.

28:20.758 --> 28:23.091
He died, uh, ten years ago.

28:23.126 --> 28:26.061
<i>No idea why he left it to me.</i>

28:26.096 --> 28:27.162
<i>Have you ever fired it?</i>

28:27.197 --> 28:28.931
<i>No. I'm not a gun guy.</i>

28:28.966 --> 28:31.799
I just tossed it into the safe,
with the rest of the ammo.

28:32.635 --> 28:34.302
<i>I thought about selling it,</i>

28:34.338 --> 28:38.673
<i>but I figured I'd hold
onto it for my nephew.</i>

28:38.708 --> 28:41.542
<i>You know, leave it to him when I die.</i>

28:44.014 --> 28:45.813
That's really weird.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.982
I never open this thing.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.784
Who knew you had this gun?

28:49.819 --> 28:53.120
Um, well my-my grandfather's lawyer,

28:53.155 --> 28:54.421
ah, my sister.

28:54.457 --> 28:56.757
Um, nobody would steal it.

28:56.793 --> 28:58.860
When was the last time you saw it?

28:58.895 --> 29:00.461
<i>Ah, I don't know, um-</i>

29:00.497 --> 29:02.329
And no one else knew it was here?

29:04.633 --> 29:06.200
My friend Dave.

29:06.235 --> 29:10.436
Um, he came over for a
beer about a month ago,

29:10.857 --> 29:12.984
<i>but he wouldn't steal it.</i>

29:13.674 --> 29:14.773
You showed him where you kept it?

29:14.809 --> 29:15.808
Yeah, but I don't...

29:15.843 --> 29:18.111
<i>How well do you know this Dave?</i>

29:18.146 --> 29:20.046
<i>Well I-I just keep my boat at his marina</i>

29:20.081 --> 29:23.383
and, um, well we go fishing sometimes.

29:23.418 --> 29:24.417
Ah-

29:26.623 --> 29:28.667
I haven't seen him in a couple weeks.

29:29.793 --> 29:32.057
You know, he was acting jittery.

29:32.092 --> 29:35.360
Um, talking about fresh starts and

29:35.716 --> 29:37.796
moving away.

29:37.832 --> 29:39.665
We'll need Dave's last name.

29:44.004 --> 29:46.004
Haven't seen Dave in almost two weeks.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.672
Took off on his boat.

29:49.843 --> 29:51.143
He say where he was going?

29:51.178 --> 29:53.108
No. Never does.

29:54.081 --> 29:55.380
He does this a lot?

29:55.416 --> 29:56.381
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:56.417 --> 29:57.982
<i>He takes off a couple times a year.</i>

29:58.018 --> 30:00.685
Says the stress gets too much.

30:01.116 --> 30:03.922
Does he have any family in town or?

30:03.957 --> 30:06.591
<i>Um, I think he's from
the Maritimes somewhere.</i>

30:06.626 --> 30:08.660
He's kind of a loner.

30:08.695 --> 30:10.595
<i>And you're his only employee?</i>

30:10.630 --> 30:13.831
<i>Yup. And we've got a
charter for a bachelor party</i>

30:13.867 --> 30:15.766
<i>that's supposed to be here in 15 minutes.</i>

30:15.801 --> 30:17.734
<i>Dave's left you with a,</i>

30:17.770 --> 30:19.002
a lot on your plate.

30:19.038 --> 30:20.704
He hasn't checked in at all?

30:20.969 --> 30:22.239
<i>You know, it's uh...</i>

30:22.275 --> 30:23.840
It's actually easier when he's not here.

30:23.876 --> 30:26.210
<i>Marci, is this the boat he's out on?</i>

30:26.245 --> 30:28.143
<i>Yeah. The "Muskee-Doe".</i>

30:29.150 --> 30:30.781
Have you seen this woman?

30:31.188 --> 30:32.732
She's really pretty.

30:32.768 --> 30:33.782
Who's she?

30:33.818 --> 30:35.852
We were wondering if Dave might know her.

30:35.888 --> 30:36.853
Dave?

30:36.889 --> 30:38.521
You've seen Dave right?

30:38.557 --> 30:39.923
<i>He'd never get a girl like that.</i>

30:39.959 --> 30:42.893
<i>Listen, if you hear from Dave,</i>

30:42.928 --> 30:44.728
or find out where he is,

30:45.216 --> 30:46.615
give us a call.

30:47.231 --> 30:48.464
Okay.

30:53.572 --> 30:56.406
Maybe Marci isn't the only
young woman Dave's into.

30:57.798 --> 31:00.042
What if Dave developed
an obsession with Red,

31:00.840 --> 31:02.579
didn't like hearing "no"?

31:02.614 --> 31:04.114
Stole his buddy's gun,

31:04.596 --> 31:06.816
took off on his boat after he shot her?

31:06.851 --> 31:08.084
Not impossible.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.953
Let's get a BOLO out on Dave

31:10.989 --> 31:12.421
and his boat.

31:12.456 --> 31:14.289
We should run this by Red.

31:18.630 --> 31:20.830
She's highly open to suggestion.

31:20.865 --> 31:22.897
She might "remember" this
is the man who shot her,

31:22.933 --> 31:24.233
even if he isn't.

31:24.268 --> 31:26.168
Someone out there tried to kill her.

31:26.203 --> 31:28.137
And the sooner she
remembers who she is...

31:28.172 --> 31:30.305
She hasn't forgotten who she is.

31:30.341 --> 31:32.341
She just can't retrieve the
information right now.

31:35.546 --> 31:37.912
So what are you doing to help her?

31:37.948 --> 31:41.449
Art therapy has proven to be
very successful in some cases.

31:41.484 --> 31:44.085
Tomorrow I'm going to
introduce various stimuli

31:44.121 --> 31:45.920
music, images, smells...

31:45.956 --> 31:48.640
Okay. So just add this
picture to the other ones.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.092
One of many,

31:51.309 --> 31:52.527
it's not suggestive.

32:05.475 --> 32:07.808
You seen anyone outside this door?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.044
Anyone called her phone?
Sent her flowers?

32:10.079 --> 32:11.311
Nothing.

32:11.914 --> 32:13.714
Alright, she so much
as talks in her sleep,

32:13.749 --> 32:15.482
Fox, I want a full transcript

32:15.517 --> 32:17.350
and make sure the night
shift knows that too.

32:17.386 --> 32:18.952
Yeah, I won't let anyone
get near her, Detective.

32:18.988 --> 32:20.387
Don't worry.

32:32.834 --> 32:34.401
<i>How long you be gone?</i>

32:34.728 --> 32:35.802
We leave Friday morning,

32:35.837 --> 32:37.237
back Sunday night.

32:38.189 --> 32:39.339
<i>Good group?</i>

32:39.374 --> 32:40.840
I think so.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.309
A few of my past students,

32:42.344 --> 32:43.945
a bunch of new faces.

32:45.155 --> 32:47.824
Probably sneak in a visit
with Kelly while I'm there.

32:49.868 --> 32:50.917
<i>What is it?</i>

32:52.453 --> 32:53.886
No, it sounds great.

32:55.023 --> 32:56.756
<i>I'd ask you to come.</i>

32:56.791 --> 32:58.024
This case.

33:00.394 --> 33:03.924
I won't have any time for you anyway.

33:09.471 --> 33:10.722
You sure about this?

33:14.684 --> 33:16.269
It's only two days.

33:18.979 --> 33:20.411
I shouldn't have asked.

33:23.917 --> 33:25.987
You don't need to worry.

34:39.297 --> 34:40.697
<i>Delorme.</i>

34:42.534 --> 34:43.967
<i>Sergeant.</i>

34:44.003 --> 34:45.402
Summer's finally here.

34:48.641 --> 34:49.840
Yeah.

34:50.476 --> 34:53.476
Heard you nailed your
interview this morning.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.147
I'll be happy to put in a good
word with my buddy Richard.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.016
He's on the ah selection committee.

35:00.886 --> 35:02.853
That won't be necessary.

35:02.888 --> 35:04.087
Well I just...

35:06.926 --> 35:08.559
I'd hate to see you lose this.

35:10.495 --> 35:11.794
And you're putting

35:11.829 --> 35:13.829
National Intelligence Service
on the resume.

35:16.834 --> 35:18.434
Sky's the limit.

35:20.505 --> 35:21.804
You need a hobby.

35:21.839 --> 35:23.506
<i>You're going to tank
your career for Cardinal?</i>

35:26.744 --> 35:28.744
He's not going to leave his wife.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.768
How did you feel when John questioned

35:39.793 --> 35:42.794
your decision to take
your students to Toronto?

35:45.596 --> 35:47.378
I wanted to slap him.

35:49.589 --> 35:51.265
But this will be the
first time I've been away

35:51.301 --> 35:53.301
since I got out of the hospital, so.

35:54.391 --> 35:55.547
<i>Are you worried?</i>

35:55.572 --> 35:57.305
I'm excited.

35:58.588 --> 36:00.588
When I try to share that with John I...

36:01.744 --> 36:03.844
I can see him gauging me.

36:03.879 --> 36:06.414
But John is your partner.

36:06.449 --> 36:08.515
He knows you're going
to have highs and lows,

36:08.550 --> 36:10.951
just as everyone does.

36:10.986 --> 36:13.954
I have to prove I'm okay.

36:14.447 --> 36:17.624
He's trying to pretend he isn't
looking for that proof and...

36:17.659 --> 36:18.726
Ugh!

36:18.761 --> 36:20.954
That sounds exhausting.

36:24.099 --> 36:27.701
We both want to believe we
can prevent the next time.

36:27.736 --> 36:29.135
That's very common.

36:31.573 --> 36:33.973
When we were in Toronto, years ago,

36:34.467 --> 36:36.643
John was working undercover.

36:37.053 --> 36:39.078
<i>He'd be gone for weeks at a time.</i>

36:39.472 --> 36:41.948
<i>One day, he came home,
just for a few hours.</i>

36:43.584 --> 36:45.651
I was manic.

36:45.686 --> 36:47.086
Apparently, he tried
to get through to me,

36:47.122 --> 36:48.087
<i>but it was too late.</i>

36:48.123 --> 36:52.068
You say 'apparently'.

36:52.593 --> 36:53.993
I don't remember.

36:55.446 --> 36:56.828
Now this is the episode

36:56.864 --> 36:58.741
that led to your suicide attempt.

37:05.038 --> 37:06.739
John's always felt it
wouldn't have happened

37:06.774 --> 37:08.173
if he'd been home.

37:10.711 --> 37:11.943
<i>Is he right?</i>

37:18.819 --> 37:20.218
I don't know.

37:28.295 --> 37:29.494
<i>Good morning.</i>

37:30.029 --> 37:31.663
Are you up for a short slide show?

37:32.999 --> 37:34.965
Do I know what to do?

37:35.001 --> 37:36.601
<i>I'm going to show you some random slides.</i>

37:36.636 --> 37:38.202
Don't look for anything specific.

37:38.237 --> 37:39.804
Just let the images wash over you.

37:39.839 --> 37:41.038
<i>Okay?</i>

38:17.543 --> 38:18.942
<i>Pause it.</i>

38:21.512 --> 38:23.046
<i>You know it?</i>

38:23.081 --> 38:24.914
No.

38:24.950 --> 38:26.782
What do you remember about that?

38:31.256 --> 38:32.688
I don't know.

38:37.127 --> 38:38.661
Where was that photo taken?

38:38.696 --> 38:39.995
Beaufort Hill.

38:40.030 --> 38:41.430
Near the trailhead.

38:46.704 --> 38:48.203
<i>The back side of Beaufort Hill</i>

38:48.239 --> 38:50.239
dumps out just off Highway 11,

38:50.274 --> 38:52.107
<i>right where the truck
driver picked her up.</i>

38:53.878 --> 38:55.277
Let's go hiking.

39:04.169 --> 39:05.668
<i>Okay, hold still.</i>

39:08.873 --> 39:10.739
That stuff doesn't work.

39:10.775 --> 39:12.842
The only thing that
works is staying inside.

39:12.877 --> 39:13.843
Trust me.

39:13.878 --> 39:15.178
They hate lemon eucalyptus.

39:15.213 --> 39:16.846
You've been here before?

39:16.881 --> 39:18.246
No.

39:18.282 --> 39:19.348
You?

39:19.383 --> 39:21.216
With my dad when I was a kid.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.757
All right, two main trails.

39:28.793 --> 39:30.425
Switch back up the mountain from here

39:30.461 --> 39:31.594
and meet at the top.

39:31.629 --> 39:33.028
I'll take that one.

40:10.433 --> 40:13.300
Made it to the end of the Beaufort Trail.

40:13.336 --> 40:14.735
I'm heading for the creek.

40:15.671 --> 40:16.870
<i>Over.</i>

40:17.740 --> 40:18.939
Copy.

40:19.962 --> 40:21.594
How's the eucalyptus working?

40:27.049 --> 40:28.248
Just great.

40:47.969 --> 40:49.969
I'm on the old Nishinabe Creek Trail.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.440
Copy. I'm halfway up.

41:17.398 --> 41:19.198
I got something.

41:19.233 --> 41:21.266
A cave by the waterfall.

41:21.302 --> 41:22.301
<i>Copy.</i>

41:22.336 --> 41:23.768
<i>I'm on my way over.</i>

41:24.305 --> 41:30.309
