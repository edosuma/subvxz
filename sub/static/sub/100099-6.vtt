00:01.262 --> 00:02.350
Previously on
Supergirl...

00:02.393 --> 00:04.613
Do what
Lex Luthor failed to do.

00:04.656 --> 00:06.093
Change the world.

00:06.136 --> 00:09.183
Rip Roar murdered
my best friend,
Russell Rogers.

00:09.226 --> 00:10.749
The DEO caught Rip Roar

00:10.793 --> 00:13.143
and they were able to ID him.
It's Russell.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.840
I sold CatCo to Andrea.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.320
She and I go way back,

00:16.364 --> 00:17.495
since boarding school.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.193
Jack Spheer and I,
we used to be close.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.499
-Until when?
-Just before I moved
to National City.

00:21.543 --> 00:24.328
You have the ability
to incept thoughts
into people's minds.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.852
I want to study your brain,
so I can develop a technology

00:26.896 --> 00:28.115
that can do the same thing.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.725
Alex!

00:30.726 --> 00:32.554
What just killed her?

00:43.086 --> 00:44.870
Thank you for coming
down here, William.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.090
Kara said if anyone would be
able to reach Rip Roar,

00:47.134 --> 00:48.352
it would be you.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.486
Russell's still in there,
I know it,

00:51.529 --> 00:54.010
but he must be acting
against his will.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.057
The man I knew
could've never done
all of those terrible things.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.233
Yes, 18 assassinations,

00:59.276 --> 01:00.669
plus one ecological
terror attack.

01:00.712 --> 01:04.107
-A thwarted terror attack.

01:04.150 --> 01:05.891
Well, we know Rip Roar
is working for someone.

01:05.935 --> 01:08.242
I'm going to find out who
and why they did this to him.

01:08.285 --> 01:10.331
I can confirm that his biotech
is still shielding him

01:10.374 --> 01:11.854
from the power
of our Truth Seeker.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.682
Can't we take that
biotech off?

01:13.725 --> 01:16.250
Whoever did this to him
attached incredibly
sophisticated technology

01:16.293 --> 01:17.773
to his nervous system.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.601
If we remove it incorrectly,
it may kill him.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.299
We've been breached.

01:22.343 --> 01:24.345
Initiate emergency protocol,
secure the facility,

01:24.388 --> 01:26.216
Brainy, I want
that power back up.

01:27.609 --> 01:28.784
Alex, the shadow.

01:30.307 --> 01:31.787
- Where'd she go?

01:40.622 --> 01:41.840
I can't get her.

01:54.070 --> 01:55.289
It's after Rip Roar.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.552
Stay right here.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.822
I don't know who
or what you are.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.954
This is my prisoner
and if you touch him,

02:08.997 --> 02:10.304
I will light you up.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.446
She's gone.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.340
Andrea.

02:47.036 --> 02:47.906
What do you want?

02:48.820 --> 02:49.734
I need your help.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.696
I need to break in
to the DEO.

02:56.350 --> 02:57.742
What's the DEO?

02:57.786 --> 02:59.309
Stop it.

02:59.353 --> 03:00.658
I know you've had
government contracts

03:00.702 --> 03:02.356
with them before,
that's why I'm here.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.227
Okay.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.708
Say we both know
what the DEO is.

03:06.751 --> 03:10.277
Why does the head of
a Fortune 500 company
need access?

03:14.629 --> 03:17.240
I know who was behind
the tidal wave that
almost took out

03:17.284 --> 03:19.024
National City.

03:19.068 --> 03:21.331
I know because
I work for them.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.986
But if I tell who
they are, they'll kill me.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.857
And you too.

03:25.901 --> 03:29.600
The DEO captured the agent
that started the tidal wave.

03:31.907 --> 03:34.953
The people I work for
want me to kill him
before he can talk.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.042
Andrea, you come to my house
and ask for my help

03:37.086 --> 03:39.349
to kill someone,
are you crazy?

03:39.393 --> 03:42.874
You know, I do know
the director of the DEO.

03:42.918 --> 03:45.137
What's to stop me from
calling her right now
and reporting you?

03:45.181 --> 03:46.922
Because I don't want
to kill him.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.794
I want to save him.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.233
He's important to me.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.625
I can breach the facility.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.410
But Supergirl is
guarding him personally

03:56.453 --> 03:57.933
and I can't get past her.

03:59.543 --> 04:02.111
You've worked
for her before.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.765
-Maybe you can.
-No.

04:04.853 --> 04:05.854
Sorry.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.247
Lena...

04:07.290 --> 04:09.379
I'm asking as a friend.

04:09.423 --> 04:10.859
We're not friends.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.567
We used to be.

04:36.058 --> 04:37.320
Hey.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.887
You're Lena,
the new kid, right?

04:40.018 --> 04:41.324
I'm Andrea.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.370
My parents didn't come
for visitor day either.

04:43.413 --> 04:44.675
Why didn't they come?

04:44.719 --> 04:46.547
My father runs
a very successful business.

04:46.590 --> 04:49.811
So he's, you know,
busy.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.161
Mother, on the other hand,
is in Paris.

04:52.204 --> 04:55.033
I don't interest her nearly
as much as her friend,

04:55.077 --> 04:55.991
the baron.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.081
What about your mom?
Let me guess.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.649
-She's off screwing a duke?
-My mother's dead.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.042
Oh.

05:06.610 --> 05:07.916
Hey.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.484
What do you say
we go to a real party tonight?

05:13.530 --> 05:15.837
Van Horne's is
my father's favorite drink.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.274
It's top, top shelf.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.362
He didn't even card us.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.190
Why would he?
We're 21.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.539
-No, we're not.
-Lena...

05:22.583 --> 05:25.194
The key to getting
what you want is confidence.

05:25.237 --> 05:28.153
Act like you already have it
and no one will question us.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.508
Come on.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.161
Favorite movie...

05:36.205 --> 05:37.815
One, two, three.

05:37.859 --> 05:38.816
Titanic.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.429
I saw it eight times
in the theater.

05:42.472 --> 05:43.908
Six times for me.

05:43.952 --> 05:46.084
My brother mocked me
relentlessly.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.826
Screw the haters,
we should all live like Rose.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.654
Do you wanna meet
your soulmate

05:50.698 --> 05:52.482
only to watch him
die tragically?

05:52.526 --> 05:55.224
No, Rose post -Titanic,

05:55.267 --> 05:56.617
-Rose Dawson.
-Oh.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.706
She went out there
and grabbed life,

05:58.749 --> 06:00.185
didn't waste a single moment.

06:00.882 --> 06:03.188
That's my dream,
go everywhere,

06:03.232 --> 06:04.668
experience everything,

06:04.712 --> 06:07.454
all while taking my dad's
company to the next level.

06:07.497 --> 06:10.544
-Those are lofty goals.
-That's what makes it fun.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.982
I have a dream like that.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.071
Lofty?

06:16.114 --> 06:17.855
Impossible.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.553
Well, now you have
to tell me

06:21.424 --> 06:24.253
My mother used to always
tell me this story

06:24.296 --> 06:26.429
about the medallion
of the Acrata.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.213
It's about this girl
whose village

06:28.257 --> 06:29.867
was being ravaged
by darkness,

06:29.911 --> 06:32.827
so she went into the wild
in search of magic
that could help.

06:32.870 --> 06:33.958
What happens?

06:34.002 --> 06:36.700
She finds the medallion
of Acrata

06:36.744 --> 06:38.354
and was bestowed great gifts

06:38.398 --> 06:39.790
so that she alone had
the strength

06:39.834 --> 06:41.575
to bend shadow
to her will.

06:41.618 --> 06:42.793
Did your mom make it up?

06:42.837 --> 06:44.969
She found it
in an old storybook.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.450
She was obsessed.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.583
She'd talk about it
like it was real.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.455
She'd draw the symbol
everywhere.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.762
Is that what you were doodling
in your notebook?

06:55.676 --> 06:57.721
She said when I got older,

06:57.765 --> 07:01.029
when things were better,

07:01.072 --> 07:03.597
that we would go
on a quest to find it.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.773
Together.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.951
It's stupid.
I'm sorry.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.387
No, it's not stupid,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.737
sometimes these legends
are based in fact,

07:13.781 --> 07:16.131
and if this medallion
is real,

07:16.174 --> 07:17.567
I'll help you find it.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.569
-You will?
-Like Rose says,

07:19.613 --> 07:21.223
"You jump, I jump."

07:26.054 --> 07:29.144
We just made
first contact with
an alien race

07:29.187 --> 07:31.451
and even apart from
the existential threat

07:31.494 --> 07:34.454
that he poses
to our entire species,

07:34.497 --> 07:35.933
I mean, how can
we measure up?

07:40.024 --> 07:41.635
From now on, this...

07:42.374 --> 07:44.072
is Luther Corp.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.770
This is insane,
your obsession
with killing Superman.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.555
We're supposed to help people.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.776
I think Spheerical Industries
is hiring.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.474
If I don't help you
murder Superman,

07:54.517 --> 07:55.823
you're firing me?

07:59.827 --> 08:02.003
I am not gonna
let you kill him.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.442
Papa,
you almost ready?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.052
The car's waiting.

08:08.096 --> 08:09.445
The new
T-Pixel 8 will excite...

08:09.489 --> 08:11.403
Papa, you have
to get dressed,

08:11.447 --> 08:14.319
we have Obsidian Worldwide's
new phone launch in an hour.

08:14.363 --> 08:18.193
-The press is waiting.
-No, they're not.

08:18.236 --> 08:23.677
Lord Industry just announced
a new T-Pixel 8.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.985
The chip is four times faster
than ours.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.987
Four times?
That's impossible.

08:30.031 --> 08:33.730
We are going to
lose billions.

08:34.601 --> 08:40.215
We have to let go
of 70% of the company

08:40.258 --> 08:42.260
by Christmas.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.349
If my company is worthless,

08:45.307 --> 08:46.830
my life is worthless.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.707
Why is your
life insurance policy out?

08:53.750 --> 08:56.884
-You promised you wouldn't
do this again, Papa.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.976
You are the best thing
in my life.

09:02.759 --> 09:05.022
I refuse to ruin you.

09:05.066 --> 09:09.853
Go and do something
better, mi cielito.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.860
Consider yourself fired.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.523
Lena.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.308
You're just the voice
I needed to hear right now.

09:30.352 --> 09:33.137
We won't know how bad
things really are for us

09:33.181 --> 09:34.835
until next week
when the board decides

09:34.878 --> 09:38.969
to either push the launch
of the phone
or kill it completely.

09:39.013 --> 09:42.582
Papa's locked himself
away in his lab till then.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.888
I've seen him bad before
but never like this.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.237
The way he looked yesterday,

09:47.325 --> 09:48.283
it scared me.

09:49.893 --> 09:52.766
Oh, how about you?
How are things going
in Luther Corp?

09:56.334 --> 09:59.337
You're not the only one
with family business problems.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.690
Lex is completely unhinged.

10:04.778 --> 10:07.737
His obsession with Superman
is out of control.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.435
He'll stop at nothing
to kill him

10:10.479 --> 10:13.351
and I am very afraid
that a lot of people are
going to get hurt...

10:14.265 --> 10:15.571
or killed in the process.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.442
-Can't you stop him?
-He pushed me out.

10:17.486 --> 10:20.968
I mean,
Lex's latest plan is to seed
the atmosphere with Kryptonite.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.013
What is Kryptonite?

10:23.057 --> 10:24.667
According to Lex,
it's Superman's
greatest weakness.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.538
-Can he do it?
-No, not yet.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.324
First, he has to figure out
how to sublimate it into vapor,

10:29.367 --> 10:33.633
but he has this mad theory
that this ancient alien element

10:33.676 --> 10:35.460
is going to help him do that.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.811
I mean, this element
crash-landed on Earth
millions of years ago.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.987
All I need to do to...

10:40.030 --> 10:43.207
save humanity
from Lex's madness is...

10:44.687 --> 10:46.733
find the element first.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.213
You already found it,
didn't you?

10:49.257 --> 10:50.693
Thanks to you.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.695
Okay, so do you remember
your anthropology dissertation

10:52.739 --> 10:55.611
about the Aztec village
that lived in the shadow
of the volcano

10:55.655 --> 10:56.786
but never got covered in lava

10:56.830 --> 10:58.309
no matter how much
the volcano erupted?

10:58.353 --> 11:00.181
And you think that's
where the alien element is?

11:00.224 --> 11:03.271
I did an intensive
satellite scan of the area

11:03.314 --> 11:04.838
and I found...

11:05.665 --> 11:06.883
this.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.497
It's that symbol
you used to draw.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.673
The medallion
of Acrata.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.849
What are the odds
that my mother's story

11:15.892 --> 11:17.720
would lead me to the one thing
that has the properties I need
to stop my brother?

11:17.764 --> 11:19.504
-It's crazy.
-It's fate.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.942
All right, so that's where
the signature is strongest,

11:21.985 --> 11:23.204
so we need to get to it.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.814
We?

11:24.858 --> 11:26.860
No, no, no,
I can't leave right now,
my father needs me.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.775
I know,
but it's three days, tops,

11:28.818 --> 11:31.038
I promise, and you yourself
said that the board

11:31.081 --> 11:32.996
wasn't going to be making
a decision for another week.

11:33.780 --> 11:34.781
Please.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.565
My brother is in
a downward spiral

11:36.608 --> 11:39.263
and I am the only one
who can save him from himself.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.788
But I can't do it alone.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.006
All right?
You studied this culture,

11:43.050 --> 11:44.965
you know the area
and the language.

11:45.008 --> 11:47.837
Besides, isn't it
what you always wanted?

11:47.881 --> 11:50.057
To go out there
and grab life?

11:50.579 --> 11:52.102
Come on.

11:52.146 --> 11:54.278
What would Rose Dawson do?

11:56.106 --> 11:57.934
"You jump, I jump, right?"

12:07.901 --> 12:10.033
Maybe there's a way around it
or through it.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.295
Wait.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.041
"And when the world around her
turned to stone,

12:18.085 --> 12:21.523
impenetrable by hope,
the girl looked down
to the core

12:24.526 --> 12:26.180
and was shown the winding way."

12:26.963 --> 12:29.139
The snake,
it's an arrow,

12:29.792 --> 12:31.185
we go this way.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.274
That's impressive.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.540
The proverbial "X" must be
around here someplace.

12:39.323 --> 12:40.803
Look.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.544
Aztec serpent-headed flowers.

12:42.587 --> 12:45.460
Didn't the girl
from the book
fight the head of a snake?

12:48.115 --> 12:49.246
No!

12:51.161 --> 12:52.510
Andrea.

12:52.554 --> 12:53.903
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

12:53.947 --> 12:57.037
Yeah, still in one piece.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.300
-I think.
-We'll make a rope ladder
and get you out.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.431
Stay right there.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.368
Lena, wait.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.596
-Andrea Rojas.

13:39.209 --> 13:42.125
-Who are you?
-I am a messenger.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.171
Nothing more, nothing less.

13:44.214 --> 13:48.479
Serpent-headed flowers,
they have psychedelic
properties

13:48.523 --> 13:50.873
and I'm hallucinating,
that's what this is.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.397
Oh, this is very real,
I assure you.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.922
As they are who sent me,

13:55.965 --> 13:57.358
Leviathan.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.273
What do they want?

13:59.316 --> 14:02.406
Your father, Bernardo Rojas,

14:02.972 --> 14:04.844
he's not well, is he?

14:04.887 --> 14:06.280
How do you...

14:07.716 --> 14:10.023
He's a brilliant man.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.546
Things will turn around
for him.

14:11.589 --> 14:14.462
He's not as strong
as you believe him to be,

14:14.505 --> 14:15.419
mi cielito.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.945
He's on the brink
of ending everything,

14:18.988 --> 14:21.469
that is why
you devote yourself to him.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.036
What do you want from me?

14:23.079 --> 14:26.169
Your happiness
and your service,
one for the other.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.998
-What does that mean?
-What matters now

14:29.042 --> 14:32.175
is if you agree, your father
will live and live well.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.222
All you have to do
is take this.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.007
No.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.053
No, no, no, I can't.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.925
My friend Lena,
she needs this.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.361
This is all she's ever wanted.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.624
You want to save
your father or not?

14:46.668 --> 14:48.409
Take the medallion.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.453
Accept your fate.

15:02.597 --> 15:05.208
Keep it on you always.

15:05.252 --> 15:10.039
Never speak of it or all
that you love will be lost.

15:10.083 --> 15:13.216
And remember,
there will come a day

15:13.260 --> 15:15.392
when we will call upon you.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.480
Be prepared.

15:18.918 --> 15:19.919
- Andrea.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.269
-I'll be right there.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.014
Are you okay?
I was so worried.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.581
Yeah, I just wanna
get out of here.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.452
Okay.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.984
This is it, Andrea,
we found it.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.507
It's the medallion.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.206
These etchings, they match
the description in the story.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.121
My calculations were right.

15:49.861 --> 15:51.385
My mother was right.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.346
But where is it? It looks like
it should be here.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.131
Maybe someone
got to it first.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.655
No, it has to be here,
it's supposed to be here,

16:00.698 --> 16:03.005
there should be some
kind of trace, the satellites--

16:03.049 --> 16:04.180
Are fallible.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.444
You could have been
picking up anything.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.186
Okay.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.405
Okay, we'll keep looking,

16:11.448 --> 16:12.710
we'll figure out who was here
and when--

16:12.754 --> 16:16.062
Lena, look, finding this place
was hard enough.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.499
Seeing who came
before or after,

16:19.543 --> 16:20.544
it's impossible.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.592
I was so close.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.334
I'm so sorry.

16:38.867 --> 16:39.868
Papa?

16:41.174 --> 16:43.306
No, no, I haven't.

16:44.525 --> 16:47.658
Lord Industries is blowing up
the market literally.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.226
Their latest smartphone
contains a faulty chip

16:50.270 --> 16:52.533
causing devices
to explode.

16:52.576 --> 16:55.014
But their loss
is Obsidian Worldwide's gain.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.059
Their stock hit
an all-time high today.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.278
Papa.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.063
That's incredible.

17:01.107 --> 17:04.371
Now back to you, Rick.
-Thank you for that...

17:04.414 --> 17:06.808
I think things are only going
to get better for us.

17:13.641 --> 17:14.729
Ms. Luthor.

17:14.771 --> 17:16.557
Why did your brother
turn the sun red?

17:17.601 --> 17:18.863
Superman.

17:18.906 --> 17:19.733
Ms. Luthor won't be answering
any questions

17:19.777 --> 17:20.865
without a lawyer present.

17:20.909 --> 17:21.997
Jack.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.520
I was such an idiot.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.262
I thought I could
save him with what?

17:26.306 --> 17:29.787
-Magical thinking?
-You believed in
the good in him.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.876
That means something.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.661
-Does it?
-Let's get out of here,

17:33.704 --> 17:34.966
out of town for a while.

17:35.010 --> 17:38.405
I have that conference
in London, come with me.

17:47.327 --> 17:48.893
You were right.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.069
I needed this.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.201
It's nice
to see you smiling again.

17:52.245 --> 17:54.899
-Go be charming.
I'll get drinks.
-Right. Okay.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.299
Andrea.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.084
Lena.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.955
I had no idea
you'd be here,

18:06.998 --> 18:08.783
I didn't know that
you were in London.

18:10.611 --> 18:11.568
Wait, what's that?

18:15.877 --> 18:16.747
I knew it.

18:18.314 --> 18:20.403
The medallion was there,
and you're the one that took it

18:20.447 --> 18:22.405
even though you knew
how much it meant to me.

18:23.885 --> 18:24.973
Why?

18:25.016 --> 18:26.366
Look, there are things
I couldn't...

18:26.409 --> 18:28.150
That I can't tell you.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.892
You looked me in the eye
and you lied to me.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.155
I trusted you
more than anyone in the world

18:33.199 --> 18:35.244
and you made a fool out of me.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.941
You know, I expect
this kind of betrayal

18:36.985 --> 18:38.595
from the Luthors,
but not you.

18:38.639 --> 18:41.555
-Lena, please.
-There's nothing you can say.

18:42.817 --> 18:43.861
We're done.

18:53.828 --> 18:56.135
Ever since London,
you've been a completely
different person,

18:56.178 --> 18:57.223
you've barely talked to me

18:57.266 --> 18:59.312
and now you're leaving
Metropolis?

18:59.355 --> 19:01.444
It's my responsibility
to make up for the stain
my brother left on the world.

19:01.488 --> 19:02.576
To do something good.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.491
We were going
to do something good.

19:04.534 --> 19:07.102
Together.
What about our company?

19:07.146 --> 19:10.105
You see this? This is why
I need to be in National City.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.629
There are people
doing good there,
who are trying to help.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.675
If I stay in Metropolis,
I will always be the sister

19:14.718 --> 19:17.330
of the egomaniacal lunatic,
but I go to National City,

19:17.373 --> 19:19.288
I can be the Luthor
that shares her home

19:19.332 --> 19:20.637
with a Kryptonian.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.509
That helps her put the world
back together

19:22.552 --> 19:24.119
instead of tearing it apart.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.729
You know I can't leave, Lena.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.605
I'm not asking you to.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.476
So...

19:34.695 --> 19:37.698
So you're choosing
to redeem the Luthor name?

19:38.264 --> 19:39.569
Over me.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.049
Over us.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.051
Lena, please, look, talk to me.

19:43.094 --> 19:44.400
You can trust me.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.446
I can't trust anyone
anymore.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.143
Going back to the studio.

19:48.187 --> 19:52.234
And the trial of Lex Luthor continues to shock the nation,

19:52.278 --> 19:55.237
painting a vivid picture
of just how far

19:55.281 --> 19:58.501
the once great name
of Luthor has fallen.

20:03.158 --> 20:06.553
I might be mistaken,
but I'm pretty sure
they call that a drink

20:06.596 --> 20:08.598
'cause that's what
you're supposed to do with it.

20:11.645 --> 20:14.038
I guess I'm not in the mood.

20:14.082 --> 20:15.649
Oh.

20:15.692 --> 20:18.652
I usually do all my drinking
when I feel the way you look.

20:18.695 --> 20:22.395
Like you've just lost
your last friend in the world.

20:23.874 --> 20:26.747
Well, I'm sure
you're very busy,
enjoy your drink.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.315
Actually...

20:29.358 --> 20:31.578
I've got nothing
but free time right now.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.536
I've been stood up.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.191
-Ouch.
-That's all right.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.671
I was going
to reject them anyway.

20:38.454 --> 20:39.803
Then it all worked out.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.416
-I guess it did.
-Hmm.

20:43.459 --> 20:44.721
What about you?

20:46.332 --> 20:49.552
What drove you
to a day of heavy non-drinking?

20:49.596 --> 20:53.600
I had a big meeting
and I completely forgot
about it.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.645
It's so unlike me,

20:55.689 --> 20:57.560
I'm usually type A, but...

20:57.604 --> 20:59.040
But the friend thing
got in the way.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.565
Okay, how do you know that?

21:02.609 --> 21:05.568
I didn't, I just have
a best friend too, that's all.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.354
I'm Andrea, by the way.

21:08.397 --> 21:09.920
Oh, I know.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.487
I'm Russell Rogers.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.054
You're the meeting I blew off?

21:15.012 --> 21:18.233
-How long did you know?
-Only since you mentioned
a business meeting.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.930
I swear.

21:19.974 --> 21:22.759
Wait, you said that
you were gonna turn down
Obsidian's offer?

21:23.499 --> 21:25.762
Well, now,
this is awkward.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.243
I'm afraid I can't accept
the position.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.505
I'm starting my own company

21:29.549 --> 21:31.768
focusing solely on
cyber-bionics.

21:31.812 --> 21:34.597
-Oh.
-Which is fortuitous
on many levels.

21:35.859 --> 21:38.558
But mostly because
I'd like to ask you to dinner.

21:38.601 --> 21:40.429
Which could've gotten
very dicey

21:40.473 --> 21:42.301
if you were my employer.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.825
-So what do you say?

21:46.870 --> 21:48.959
Breaking news
from National City.

21:49.003 --> 21:51.614
Lena Luthor, National City's
newest predominant resident,

21:51.658 --> 21:53.790
was rescued from an assassination attempt today

21:53.834 --> 21:57.011
by the Kryptonian duo of
Superman and Supergirl.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.624
Well, if it isn't
National City's

22:01.668 --> 22:03.452
newest hotshot reporter.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.280
-I was just reading
your article.
-That's actually why I'm here,

22:05.324 --> 22:08.805
I have to say thank you
for helping me find
that fight club.

22:08.849 --> 22:11.634
You've been in the city a month
and you've already saved my job

22:11.678 --> 22:13.332
an embarrassing amount
of times.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.030
Well, I am sure you will return
the favor when the time comes.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.684
On that note,

22:17.727 --> 22:20.774
I also wanted to give you this.

22:20.817 --> 22:23.559
Someone hacked into
the emails at L-Corp

22:23.603 --> 22:25.692
and sent them
to CatCo anonymously.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.346
I was able to snag the data

22:27.389 --> 22:29.652
and there are some potentially
embarrassing things in there,

22:29.696 --> 22:31.567
but for the most part,
it's not newsworthy.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.308
I just remember you saying

22:33.352 --> 22:35.005
you want to make a name
for yourself outside of
your family

22:35.049 --> 22:38.400
and I would hate for
some jerk to ruin that.

22:38.444 --> 22:41.534
I knew there'd been a breach
but I thought we caught
everything.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.884
Thank you, Kara.

22:43.927 --> 22:46.234
You know how you could
thank me?

22:46.277 --> 22:49.542
We have this game night thing
and my sister and I dominate

22:49.585 --> 22:52.545
and we are in desperate need
of a worthy adversary.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.851
I'm sorry, Kara,
when I said I wanted us

22:54.895 --> 22:56.549
to have a positive
relationship,

22:56.592 --> 22:58.594
it was because I thought
we could help each other.

22:58.638 --> 23:03.077
But let me be clear, I meant
a business relationship.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.689
I would hate for you
to give me these emails

23:06.733 --> 23:08.735
out of some misplaced
sense of friendship.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.346
I didn't come here
to make friends,

23:11.390 --> 23:12.608
so by all means,

23:12.652 --> 23:14.044
publish the emails.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.872
I would never do that, Lena.

23:15.916 --> 23:19.049
But if you change your mind,
the invite always stands.

23:19.093 --> 23:20.268
Every Friday night.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.231
How can a vegan restaurant
not identify itself?

23:27.754 --> 23:29.451
-It's cruel.
-I know.

23:29.495 --> 23:32.280
Our six-month
anniversary ruined.

23:32.323 --> 23:34.108
You know, I vote
for a do-over.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.632
Barbecue?

23:36.676 --> 23:38.199
Stop talking so sexy.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.989
-See you tonight?
-Yes.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.036
-Ah.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.086
He's very handsome.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.828
Sorry, I don't have
any cash on me.

23:58.872 --> 24:01.178
I don't need your money,
just what you promised.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.311
Your service.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.705
You knew there would be a time

24:05.748 --> 24:07.794
when Leviathan
would call on you.

24:11.798 --> 24:13.016
What do you want from me?

24:14.104 --> 24:15.628
Go to this location,

24:15.671 --> 24:18.282
find the man on this card

24:18.326 --> 24:19.240
and kill him.

24:22.025 --> 24:25.594
-I'm not a killer.
-You are what we say you are.

24:25.638 --> 24:28.118
You weren't successful
and then we said you were.

24:28.162 --> 24:31.818
Your father was suicidal
and now he's not.

24:31.861 --> 24:35.343
Did you really think all of
this didn't come with a price?

24:36.344 --> 24:37.693
I won't do it.

24:37.737 --> 24:39.782
You refuse us, but...

24:39.826 --> 24:43.003
a day from now your father
will be accused of
insider trading,

24:43.046 --> 24:46.572
stocks will tumble,
the company will be decimated.

24:46.615 --> 24:48.138
One night,
while awaiting trial,

24:48.182 --> 24:50.489
your father will put on
his striped pajamas,

24:50.532 --> 24:52.360
he will take the elevator
to the roof

24:52.403 --> 24:53.840
and when he steps up
on the ledge,

24:53.883 --> 24:56.059
his last words will be,

24:56.712 --> 24:58.801
"I failed you, mi cielito."

25:07.288 --> 25:08.985
Listen to me very carefully.

25:09.029 --> 25:12.467
Take the medallion,
tap it three times,

25:12.511 --> 25:13.860
you'll know what to do.

25:43.367 --> 25:44.717
Governor Harper?

25:45.152 --> 25:46.327
Governor Harper!

25:50.505 --> 25:53.682
Last month, Cat Grant
joined the Marsdin
administration

25:53.726 --> 25:58.861
and since her appointment,
she's made a big impact.
Today in technology news...

25:58.905 --> 26:00.167
Lena.

26:00.210 --> 26:01.516
-Kara.
-Hi.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.692
-Hi, it's really good
to see you.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.738
-Are you waiting for someone?
-Not today,

26:05.781 --> 26:07.174
I have a hot date
with some spreadsheets.

26:07.217 --> 26:08.741
Oh.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.308
I'm actually meeting
my sister here, she loves it.

26:11.352 --> 26:14.311
She makes us order
every appetizer on the menu.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.838
Actually, I'm lying,
I'm the one that orders
all the appetizers.

26:19.882 --> 26:21.971
-That sounds like fun.
-Yeah.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.756
Look, I heard you when you said

26:23.799 --> 26:25.409
you didn't wanna connect
with anyone

26:25.453 --> 26:27.629
but I've been
the new girl in town

26:27.673 --> 26:29.457
and I put my guards up too.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.634
But I was miserable.

26:32.678 --> 26:35.681
And if I hadn't let someone in,
my sister,

26:35.724 --> 26:36.943
actually...

26:37.857 --> 26:40.120
I think I would've drowned
in it.

26:42.688 --> 26:43.776
Oh.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.343
And...

26:46.387 --> 26:48.868
I guess my sister has to work.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.087
I... You do, too,

26:51.131 --> 26:53.220
I'm sorry,
I'll leave you alone.

26:55.396 --> 26:56.484
Kara.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.924
Don't be ridiculous,
you can't eat all
those apps on your own.

27:02.490 --> 27:03.752
Why don't you join me.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.058
Really?

27:07.016 --> 27:08.757
Okay, but I'm warning you,

27:08.801 --> 27:09.932
people have been
underestimating

27:09.976 --> 27:12.021
how much I can eat
for years.

27:12.065 --> 27:13.327
Oh, game on.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.940
-You all right?
-Russ.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.813
Hey, you're home early.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.036
What's going on?

27:27.080 --> 27:29.343
Something's been off
with you for weeks.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.738
I'm worried
you're into something bad.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.478
Something dangerous.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.220
It's just, um...

27:38.439 --> 27:40.528
A private family thing.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.705
Look, I'm exhausted,

27:43.749 --> 27:45.228
I'm gonna go take a shower.

28:09.992 --> 28:12.255
What are you doing?
No, stop!

28:12.299 --> 28:14.170
You know Leviathan
required complete discretion.

28:14.214 --> 28:17.043
You were careless,
he got too close.

28:17.086 --> 28:19.088
Our secrets are more important
than any life.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.874
No, no, no,
he's a good person.

28:21.917 --> 28:24.224
This isn't his fault,
please.

28:24.267 --> 28:25.878
Finish it, make it look like
a home invasion.

28:25.921 --> 28:27.836
No, wait!

28:28.576 --> 28:29.577
He can help you.

28:30.404 --> 28:31.622
This is Russell Rogers,

28:31.666 --> 28:33.886
he's working on
medical advancements.

28:33.929 --> 28:36.279
He has a prototype
that can bring soldiers back

28:36.323 --> 28:38.542
from the brink of death
and then some.

28:39.195 --> 28:40.849
He can be very useful to you.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.481
It's okay.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.979
Your friends...

29:24.023 --> 29:27.069
have been lying to you
from the start.

29:28.505 --> 29:32.031
Every last one.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.425
...the last five years.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.427
And we have an update
on the Lex Luthor story.

29:37.471 --> 29:40.996
Lex Luthor and his master plan to manipulate the Kaznians.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.520
The Girl of Steel
saves the day again.

29:43.564 --> 29:46.610
-Supergirl saved--
-Obsidian Worldwide
announced this week

29:46.654 --> 29:49.265
that they will be opening a new branch to be spearheaded

29:49.309 --> 29:53.269
by CEO Bernardo Rojas'
daughter Andrea Rojas.

29:53.313 --> 29:55.445
Obsidian's entrance into
the North American market

29:55.489 --> 29:57.578
marks a turning point
for the company,

29:57.621 --> 30:00.189
which has thus far avoided
the American market.

30:00.233 --> 30:03.671
CEO Bernando Rojas,
once a gallant trailblazer...

30:20.688 --> 30:22.385
I never needed them.

30:25.432 --> 30:26.607
Any of them.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.613
But that doesn't mean
they can't be useful.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.791
I was glad to get
a call from you, Lena.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.184
I've missed you.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.403
It's been a long time.

30:41.578 --> 30:43.493
I thought I'd never
hear from you again.

30:44.712 --> 30:47.323
Well, I was thinking...

30:47.367 --> 30:49.151
that you and I have too much
to offer each other

30:49.195 --> 30:51.850
to let ancient history
get in the way of
a potential partnership.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.416
Okay.

30:53.460 --> 30:54.896
I'm listening.

30:54.940 --> 30:58.334
Well, I'm sure you've heard
of Lex's latest misdeeds.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.859
He's left me with
quite a mess to clean up.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.295
Financially.

31:04.645 --> 31:05.994
So I'm selling CatCo.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.693
-That's a shame.
-I'm glad you think so.

31:09.737 --> 31:12.609
Because I believe
I've found the perfect
person to take it over.

31:13.741 --> 31:14.568
You.

31:15.264 --> 31:17.005
I already run a tech company.

31:17.049 --> 31:21.183
Tech gets you money,
but media gets you control of
the markets.

31:21.227 --> 31:23.925
And CatCo would be the perfect
advertising platform

31:23.969 --> 31:25.709
for Obsidian.

31:25.753 --> 31:26.797
That's an interesting thought,

31:26.841 --> 31:28.495
I've honestly never
considered it.

31:28.538 --> 31:29.757
You should.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.063
And I know you've been
looking for a place

31:31.106 --> 31:33.979
for Obsidian North's
new headquarters.

31:34.022 --> 31:36.024
I think National City
could be a good fit.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.374
It would be nice
to be in the same city again.

31:39.636 --> 31:40.681
Just like old times.

31:43.292 --> 31:46.165
Why don't we discuss
the details?

31:52.040 --> 31:53.520
Every time I look at you,

31:53.563 --> 31:55.957
I'm reminded of all
the horrible things I've done.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.177
Honey, every time
I look at you,

31:58.220 --> 31:59.743
all I remember is pain.

31:59.787 --> 32:02.616
Lena, for so long I wanted
to tell you the truth, but...

32:03.530 --> 32:04.531
I was scared.

32:04.574 --> 32:05.793
That medallion was
the only thing

32:05.836 --> 32:06.968
that could've stopped
my brother

32:07.012 --> 32:09.275
-and you knew that.
-Everything I did,

32:09.318 --> 32:12.278
every decision was to save
my father's life.

32:12.321 --> 32:15.281
My brother was
a homicidal maniac.

32:15.324 --> 32:18.240
A lot of innocent people
are dead because of him,
because of you.

32:18.284 --> 32:21.548
I am well aware of how much
blood there is on my hands.

32:23.506 --> 32:24.420
And I'm so sorry.

32:24.464 --> 32:25.552
Because you say you're sorry,

32:25.595 --> 32:27.423
it doesn't make
everything better.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.425
Okay? How am I supposed
to believe you now?

32:29.469 --> 32:32.167
Because you were right
all along.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.305
It was magical.

32:50.316 --> 32:51.534
Lena.

32:57.149 --> 33:00.369
"And she had the strength
to bend shadow to her will."

33:00.413 --> 33:02.502
It wasn't a metaphor
about overcoming darkness,

33:02.545 --> 33:05.461
-it was literal.
-It came with the ability
to move through shadows.

33:05.505 --> 33:07.463
And you've had
this ability the whole time?

33:07.507 --> 33:10.205
It's not a gift,
it's a curse.

33:10.249 --> 33:12.077
I never wanted to betray you.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.862
But my father,
he was gonna die...

33:17.125 --> 33:19.388
so I did what I had to do.

33:19.432 --> 33:23.697
But it cost me the love of
my life and my best friend.

33:26.178 --> 33:29.964
Taking this from you was
the biggest mistake of my life.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.097
I know I've done
terrible things.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.316
But this is my chance
to do something good.

33:36.362 --> 33:38.712
Please, you have to believe me.

33:45.588 --> 33:46.763
I believe you.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.897
I'm tired of people
hurting each other.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.117
Doing harm.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.250
So you'll help me?

33:56.817 --> 33:58.732
"You jump, I jump, right?"

34:02.388 --> 34:04.868
-Did Brainy say anything?
-Not yet.

34:04.912 --> 34:07.915
But there is an old piece
of Cadmus tech in the vaults

34:07.958 --> 34:10.135
that could help us
remove his biotech

34:10.178 --> 34:12.092
and force an answer
out of him.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.572
So I'll go get it.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.793
William told me about you,

34:17.838 --> 34:21.014
well, he told me about Russell,
how good a friend he was,

34:21.059 --> 34:23.277
how devastating
it was to lose him.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.367
You know,
William sacrificed everything,

34:25.411 --> 34:27.369
dedicated himself
to finding out

34:27.413 --> 34:29.676
what happened to Russell.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.373
So I guess you must've been
pretty special.

34:31.417 --> 34:33.027
The person William knew
is gone.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.289
I don't agree.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.594
I think you're working
for someone

34:35.638 --> 34:38.119
and they're forcing you
to do these things.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.728
I know you feel
you've gone too far

34:39.773 --> 34:40.904
to ever be Russell again

34:40.947 --> 34:42.297
but you're wrong.

34:42.341 --> 34:45.126
It is never too late
to try to make things right.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.780
Or at least better.

34:47.433 --> 34:49.217
Who did this to you?

34:49.261 --> 34:50.652
I can keep you safe.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.396
They're called Leviathan.

34:59.532 --> 35:00.837
Good.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.187
Now here's how this will go.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.536
I'll handle Supergirl.

35:06.408 --> 35:08.715
I have to go, um...

35:08.758 --> 35:09.803
Thank you.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.113
Lena. Lena?

35:15.156 --> 35:17.245
-Lena. Lena.
-Kara.

35:17.289 --> 35:19.204
Oh, thank God you're here.
It was horrible,

35:19.247 --> 35:21.162
it was here one minute
and gone the next,

35:21.206 --> 35:22.729
she's like a shadow.

35:22.772 --> 35:25.079
I'll jam all incoming signals.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.559
I've recently developed
a device

35:26.602 --> 35:28.038
that can incept
a single thought

35:28.082 --> 35:30.432
into the surrounding area,
"Do no harm."

35:30.476 --> 35:32.782
Plant it at the DEO.

35:32.826 --> 35:35.307
It will disable all agents
that get in your way.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.179
I'll control it from here

35:38.223 --> 35:40.007
and then the DEO is yours.

35:48.842 --> 35:50.017
J'onn, is everything okay?

35:50.060 --> 35:52.019
I felt a psychic attack
at the DEO.

35:52.933 --> 35:53.977
It felt like my brother.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.196
That's impossible.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.458
There must be something else.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.417
I just have a bad feeling.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.810
Well, we still have
the psychic inhibitor buds.

36:00.854 --> 36:03.030
-I'll be careful.
-Okay, see you soon.

36:14.737 --> 36:17.523
Supergirl, I think we have
a bit of a situation here.

36:19.525 --> 36:21.353
Supergirl, do you copy?

36:39.371 --> 36:41.024
Director Danvers.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.462
Agent Dox, someone
incepted the DEO,

36:43.505 --> 36:44.593
we're the only two unaffected.

36:44.637 --> 36:46.856
That is an erroneous
assumption.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.558
We must do no harm.

37:01.131 --> 37:02.568
Sorry, Brainy.

37:10.445 --> 37:11.533
I knew I felt something.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.100
Where is Supergirl?

37:14.710 --> 37:16.669
Oh, hell no.

37:16.712 --> 37:18.714
-Make sure the shadow
doesn't get to Rip Roar.
-Right.

37:32.989 --> 37:34.556
Supergirl!

37:35.731 --> 37:37.820
Alex is in trouble,
stay here.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.127
No, no.

37:48.962 --> 37:50.746
If you think
you can hurt my friends,

37:50.790 --> 37:52.966
to get me out of the way,
you got another thing coming.

37:57.623 --> 38:00.800
Please don't fight.
I want to help you.

38:08.895 --> 38:09.896
No!

38:16.685 --> 38:19.340
Lena, I honestly don't know
how I can ever repay you.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.124
You can start by
giving me the medallion.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.474
I can't.

38:24.606 --> 38:26.869
You'd incept me
to give you this.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.001
Much worse.

38:29.524 --> 38:30.917
Russell, pick up the scalpel.

38:36.966 --> 38:38.881
Now hold it
to your carotid artery.

38:40.970 --> 38:43.321
And press. Slowly.

38:43.364 --> 38:44.452
Please, Lena, don't do this.

38:44.496 --> 38:45.627
Then give me the medallion.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.761
This is what
you wanted this whole time.

38:48.804 --> 38:51.677
I helped you save Russell,
now I want what I deserve.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.505
I was desperate,
my father was weak,

38:53.548 --> 38:55.376
he was going to die.
Everything I did,

38:55.420 --> 38:56.551
I did for love.

38:56.595 --> 38:58.466
That's what hurt the most.

38:58.510 --> 39:00.555
I cared about you more than
anyone else in the world

39:00.599 --> 39:02.688
and I never
would've betrayed you.

39:07.867 --> 39:09.912
I told you this thing
is a curse.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.220
Our friendship was the curse.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.223
Russell, put the scalpel down.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.226
-Now go, both of you.

39:28.235 --> 39:30.542
Malefic must've been
working with the assassin.

39:30.585 --> 39:31.891
How else could he have
incepted everyone?

39:31.934 --> 39:34.197
Believe me, I want to know
who is responsible,

39:34.241 --> 39:35.547
but Malefic did not do this.

39:35.590 --> 39:36.852
So we're back to square one.

39:36.896 --> 39:39.333
We're not,
I got something from Rip Roar.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.813
A name.

39:41.509 --> 39:42.858
Leviathan.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.599
We'll start gathering intel
immediately.

39:44.643 --> 39:47.167
Okay, but I have to break
some bad news first.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.388
- Russell got away.

39:50.431 --> 39:51.911
The same operative
that attacked yesterday

39:51.954 --> 39:55.088
came again, they worked
as a team and now he's gone.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.395
I'm so sorry.

39:57.438 --> 39:59.658
I was wrong about him
all along.

39:59.701 --> 40:01.964
No, I don't think you were.

40:02.008 --> 40:05.446
Supergirl told us he's been
working against his will.

40:05.490 --> 40:07.579
I don't think he ever meant
to betray you.

40:10.016 --> 40:12.018
I'm sorry,
if it weren't for me,

40:12.061 --> 40:14.150
they never would've
come for you.

40:16.718 --> 40:19.025
You saved my life.

40:19.068 --> 40:21.288
Even before that,
you made it worth living.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.555
No. Russ, no, no, Russ.

40:27.599 --> 40:30.297
No, no, no!

40:30.340 --> 40:31.733
Somebody help, please.

40:31.777 --> 40:33.866
Russ! Please, somebody help!

40:35.084 --> 40:36.695
You can't escape us,

40:36.738 --> 40:40.438
nor the powers
we bestowed upon you.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.918
I don't even have
the medallion anymore.

40:42.962 --> 40:44.180
What do you want?

40:44.224 --> 40:46.444
The powers never came
from the medallion.

40:46.487 --> 40:47.836
It activated them.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.057
But they came from the darkness
within you.

40:52.101 --> 40:54.495
And that is something
you can never escape.

40:54.539 --> 40:55.975
No...

40:56.976 --> 40:58.978
No.

41:01.502 --> 41:04.287
Not so fast, Lena,
I'm gonna get you.

41:04.331 --> 41:06.551
I got you.

41:12.644 --> 41:16.299
Oh, no, no.

41:16.343 --> 41:17.823
I found it, Mother.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.004
End simulation.

41:27.049 --> 41:30.488
Ms. Luthor, preliminary tests
confirm any properties

41:30.531 --> 41:32.968
the medallion may have had
are gone.

41:33.012 --> 41:36.145
Doesn't matter,
can you translate
these markings?

41:45.198 --> 41:47.679
Now access the memories
of Eve Tessmacher

41:47.722 --> 41:50.159
and tell me everything
she knows about Leviathan.
