00:12.971 --> 00:14.639
Hmm. This tastes different.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.475
Oh, I'm trying a new flavor creamer.
It's Almond Joy.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.185
We are living the dream.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.313
[sighs]

00:22.397 --> 00:24.232
Must have caffeine.

00:24.816 --> 00:25.734
Thank you.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.280
Did you not sleep last night?

00:30.363 --> 00:32.073
No. Not a wink.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.658
I had a bad dream that kept me up.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.660
I think it means Kimmy's not pregnant.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.620
That's ridiculous.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.914
Tell me your dream, and I'll interpret it.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.458
OK.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.085
You took a pregnancy test,
and it came back negative.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.505
That could mean anything.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.759
Yeah, but that's not all.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.678
I saw people having a weird dance party,

00:53.762 --> 00:56.347
and then this ominous cloud
enveloped the house.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.184
And then a masked man
appeared out of nowhere.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.643
So what does all that mean?

01:01.436 --> 01:04.939
It means you shouldn't eat the Taco Bell
five-buck box right before bed.

01:06.816 --> 01:09.194
I knew I should've hidden
those wrappers better.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.823
Anyway, I just have a terrible feeling
that today is gonna be a very bad day.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.451
No, today's gonna be the best day.

01:16.534 --> 01:18.495
Dad, Uncle Jesse, and Joey are coming up

01:18.578 --> 01:21.456
to celebrate their 30-year "Dad-iversary."

01:24.959 --> 01:28.296
And when we're all together,
nothing bad ever happens.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.759
And have you noticed,
when there are problems,

01:32.842 --> 01:35.053
they're always fixed in,
like, half an hour.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.098
It's the Tanner-Fuller magic.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.602
Yeah, maybe I'm just being silly.

01:43.353 --> 01:46.940
I can't believe it's been 30 years
since Uncle Jesse and Joey moved in.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.484
I know. Seems like it was just yesterday.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.030

Aw, Joey, buddy, this is the best,
you're moving in.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.758
Thanks, Danny.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.510
This works out so perfect.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.637
I move into a place
with a washing machine,

02:17.720 --> 02:20.515
on the exact day
I run out of clean clothes.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.106
I hope you guys had a fun flashback.

02:30.358 --> 02:33.153
I've just been standing here,
watching you two in a trance.

[Joey] Aw, hey.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.228
Aw, thanks for washing these, Deej.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.856
I am down to my last pair
of clean underpants.

03:09.939 --> 03:10.773
What?

03:12.275 --> 03:13.735
On my guitar, huh?

03:23.244 --> 03:25.955
I didn't make a goofy entrance.
I already lived here.

03:26.789 --> 03:27.624
Hey, honey.

03:27.707 --> 03:28.917
-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, baby.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.085
Hi.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.882
Mr. T, you forgot my hug.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.259
Oh, I didn't forget.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.180
Uh, you might wanna be a little nicer,

03:42.263 --> 03:45.183
considering I might be giving birth
to your next grandchild.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.477
Really?

03:48.144 --> 03:49.604
There was no one else?

03:51.147 --> 03:52.106
Nope.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.608
Bring it in, Grandpa.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.404
It's so cute.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.282
You're wearing the same clothes
as the day you moved in.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.160
Well, I'm wearing the same outfit.
They got bigger sizes.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.509
Don't worry.
I've got the baby and all the luggage.

Steve and I are finally
going on our first date.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.252
Wasn't your first date with Steve
in high school?

04:54.627 --> 04:57.005
OK, technically
it's our second first date.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.216
I thought your second first date
was two years ago.

05:01.926 --> 05:04.554
Yeah. Before you got together
with that hunky Matt guy.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.140
So, really, it's your third first date.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.935
Wow, you people really keep tabs
on my love life.

05:12.228 --> 05:15.690
Well, we three guys have a surprise
for all of you right outside.

05:15.773 --> 05:18.693
Let us take you back to the fall of 1987,

05:18.776 --> 05:21.446
when our mullets were as big
as our portable phones.

05:24.407 --> 05:25.616
Oh, that's OK.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.827
I'll watch the kids
and put away the luggage.

05:27.910 --> 05:28.828
Oh, OK.

05:28.911 --> 05:29.912

[Danny] I wish.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.634
I'm renting it by the hour.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.929
OK, everybody,
remember your assigned seats.

05:47.638 --> 05:50.266
Hey, I know I wasn't there
on the very first day,

05:50.349 --> 05:51.851
but can I come anyway?

05:51.934 --> 05:55.646
Well, since you're already in the car,
do we have a choice? Come on!

11:16.342 --> 11:18.386
OK, listen, sweetheart, uh...

11:18.469 --> 11:21.180
don't call me back
till you get us more money, OK?

11:21.847 --> 11:22.848
Love you, too.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.357

It's you, my friend.

come down those steps, dressed up,

it melts my heart.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.335
You realize I'm 40 with three kids.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.797
It doesn't matter.
You'll always be my little girl.

[doorbell rings]

12:39.967 --> 12:40.968
It's always open!

Really?

12:43.345 --> 12:44.555
You never lock your door?

12:44.638 --> 12:45.973
That doesn't seem safe.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.684
Hey, everybody.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.443
And don't you look stunning, Dr. Fuller.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.654
You look pretty good yourself, Dr. Hale.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.991
We get it. You're doctors.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.660
Come on, let's go.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.537
Deej, I got bad news.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.039
We can't go to the restaurant.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.833
This huge fog just rolled in.
It's not even safe to drive.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.461
Wait, did I hear you say "fog?"

13:16.045 --> 13:19.965
That's the second thing from my dream
that's come true. The dark, ominous cloud.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.135
This just confirms my bad feeling
about your pregnancy.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.805
You're reading too much into this.
It's San Francisco. There's always fog.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.058
What about men having weird dance parties?

13:30.935 --> 13:32.645
Once again, it's San Francisco.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.775
I was really looking forward
to our third first date.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.239
Hey, why don't we just treat you guys
to a romantic dinner right here at home?

13:43.322 --> 13:44.865
It'll be fun, right, guys?

13:45.282 --> 13:46.617
Ah, I don't know.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.746
You want us to pretend like
the living room is a restaurant?

13:50.829 --> 13:52.164
I think it's a little hokey.

13:53.832 --> 13:54.750
Are you new here?

13:56.085 --> 13:57.253
This is what we do.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.965
Come on, guys. I'll be the chef, OK?

14:01.048 --> 14:02.925
I've been told that my meatloaf

14:03.008 --> 14:05.553
is practically prison quality.

Come on, Jess.
You can be the maître d'.

-Because...

14:18.732 --> 14:19.984
I'll do it. Sure. Why not?

to have our romantic date.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.577
And what could be more romantic

14:29.660 --> 14:32.538

watch us eat dinner?

It feels so right.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.115

Wait, wait, wait. What happened?

19:21.952 --> 19:23.203
We asked for too much money.

They decided to go with Mario Lopez.
