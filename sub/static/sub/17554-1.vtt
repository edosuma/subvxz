Your email is missing.

02:41.667 --> 02:43.334
No longer valid.

02:43.459 --> 02:45.417
Excuse me?
I didn't get that.

02:45.542 --> 02:47.126
No email.

02:49.084 --> 02:51.251
Urn to keep at home...

02:56.792 --> 02:57.792
Aloys?

02:59.209 --> 03:01.667
Just give me the payment slip.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.626
Julie Kramer...

03:05.167 --> 03:06.501
We went to school together.

03:06.626 --> 03:08.626
We don't know each other,
young lady.

03:09.834 --> 03:11.334
Sorry.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.751
Can you feel him kicking?

04:47.751 --> 04:51.084
He wants to get out.
He can barely wait.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.917
It must be a bit lonely in there.

04:56.292 --> 04:59.584
<i>I'm getting cold, darling.
Can we go to your place, please?</i>

04:59.709 --> 05:00.917
<i>I'd rather not, Kathrin.</i>

05:01.042 --> 05:03.751
<i>We always meet outside.
Do you have something to hide?</i>

05:03.876 --> 05:06.959
<i>- What do you mean, "hide"?
- You never take me to your place.</i>

05:10.292 --> 05:11.292
Hello?

05:11.417 --> 05:15.042
Mrs Schoch, you shouldn't contact us
during the observation.

05:20.126 --> 05:22.709
Mrs Schoch? She's pregnant.

05:26.001 --> 05:27.792
C'est la vie...

05:27.917 --> 05:29.709
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

05:29.834 --> 05:31.917
That's French.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.542
<i>Get that son of a bitch on the phone!</i>

05:36.667 --> 05:40.417
We don't interact with out targets.
We'll get back to you tomorrow.

05:57.209 --> 05:58.834
<i>First new message:</i>

05:58.959 --> 06:01.792
<i>This is Julie Kramer
from the crematorium.</i>

06:03.084 --> 06:06.417
<i>The cremation is confirmed for Friday.</i>

06:07.251 --> 06:09.917
<i>I'm sorry about earlier.</i>

06:10.042 --> 06:12.292
<i>It was the wrong moment.</i>

06:12.417 --> 06:16.167
<i>We'll see each other at the cremation.
Let's chat then.</i>

06:17.459 --> 06:18.917
<i>I'm curious about what's become of you...</i>

06:19.042 --> 06:20.834
<i>Message deleted.</i>

07:06.001 --> 07:08.251
I'd like to order something.

07:09.584 --> 07:11.209
Hello, Mr Adorn.

07:12.001 --> 07:14.167
I'm sorry about your father.

07:16.376 --> 07:18.459
One portion of rice to go.

07:22.501 --> 07:25.584
In China, when somebody dies,
we get rid of bad spirits

07:25.709 --> 07:27.626
with fireworks.

07:28.501 --> 07:30.001
We don't need that.

08:19.459 --> 08:21.376
Hello, Mr Detective.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.209
Evening.

08:25.084 --> 08:28.792
Is it true that you catch missing cats
and don't bring them back?

08:28.917 --> 08:29.917
No.

08:40.708 --> 08:42.042
Hello.

08:59.334 --> 09:02.292
<i>You're even more friendly
than your father.</i>

09:27.876 --> 09:30.876
<i>Oh I'm so cold.
Touch it.</i>

10:42.459 --> 10:44.876
<i>Do you have a vacuum cleaner?</i>

12:27.167 --> 12:28.626
Mrs Schoch...

12:28.751 --> 12:32.418
My boss isn't available right now,
but we'll intercept Mr Schoch.

12:32.542 --> 12:34.834
At 4pm, on the dot.

12:34.959 --> 12:36.792
Yes, we thank you.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.042
Hello?

15:20.167 --> 15:23.751
Our camera bag was stolen
on the bus.

15:25.292 --> 15:28.792
Including 9 DV tapes.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.250
Strictly confidential material.

15:31.376 --> 15:34.334
As well as an ID card from the
Swiss Association of Private Investigators.

15:34.459 --> 15:36.667
Issued to Adorn Junior.

18:00.584 --> 18:02.334
Yes, hello?

18:03.209 --> 18:05.376
<i>I imagined your voice would be different.</i>

18:06.417 --> 18:08.334
<i>Say something else.</i>

18:13.334 --> 18:14.709
<i>I like it.</i>

18:14.834 --> 18:17.001
<i>But it's obvious
that you don't like talking.</i>

18:17.126 --> 18:19.542
Who are you?
What do you want?

18:20.584 --> 18:23.042
<i>Is it OK to call you Adorn?</i>

18:23.167 --> 18:25.251
<i>Aloys feels too personal.</i>

18:26.501 --> 18:29.001
You stole our camera.

18:29.792 --> 18:31.626
<i>I watched your videos.</i>

18:32.334 --> 18:33.584
<i>Your dead father.</i>

18:34.334 --> 18:36.751
<i>The people you spy on.</i>

18:36.876 --> 18:40.584
<i>Your cat who, incidentally,
has a magnesium deficiency,</i>

18:40.709 --> 18:42.584
<i>and who will die soon too.</i>

18:42.709 --> 18:44.667
<i>You even film me and Rolf.</i>

18:44.792 --> 18:46.792
I don't know anyone called Rolf.

18:48.209 --> 18:49.959
<i>Do you know anyone at all?</i>

18:51.417 --> 18:53.001
<i>Adorn?</i>

18:54.667 --> 18:59.459
<i>I thought I'd send the videos back
to the people you secretly film.</i>

19:01.584 --> 19:03.626
<i>You could apologise to them.</i>

19:04.334 --> 19:06.417
<i>- To me too.</i>
- No, young lady,

19:06.542 --> 19:08.959
you'll hand over these items
to lost property office,

19:09.084 --> 19:11.042
or we'll inform the authorities.

19:11.167 --> 19:14.459
<i>I picture you...
in your blue jumper,</i>

19:14.584 --> 19:16.626
<i>with your sad eyes.</i>

19:17.292 --> 19:18.792
<i>Good night.</i>

20:13.251 --> 20:17.709
Believe in your invisibility -
it is given to you.

20:17.834 --> 20:21.292
Avoid mirrors,
shadows and echoes.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.292
Be quieter than the wind.

20:34.292 --> 20:36.084
Testing... testing...

20:36.876 --> 20:38.292
Testing... testing...

20:53.167 --> 20:54.542
<i>Hello.</i>

20:55.917 --> 20:59.876
We'll work out a practical solution
both parties can agree to.

21:00.001 --> 21:01.709
<i>Very good.</i>

21:02.709 --> 21:06.751
<i>The secret lies in the filtered frequencies
through the phone.</i>

21:06.876 --> 21:07.876
What?

21:08.001 --> 21:10.584
<i>Phone-walking
was invented in 1984</i>

21:10.709 --> 21:12.751
<i>by a Japanese neurologist.</i>

21:12.876 --> 21:14.542
A practical solution, young lady.

21:14.667 --> 21:16.459
<i>For shy men.</i>

21:18.209 --> 21:19.917
<i>How's your cat?</i>

21:20.751 --> 21:22.334
<i>Do you give it magnesium?</i>

21:22.459 --> 21:24.709
Listen very carefully, young lady...

21:25.751 --> 21:27.584
<i>Just listen.</i>

21:52.084 --> 21:56.001
<i>You've pictured a train, right?</i>

21:57.209 --> 21:59.626
<i>That's how phone-walking works.</i>

22:00.542 --> 22:02.417
<i>You picture a face.</i>

22:05.792 --> 22:07.751
No, a definite no.

22:07.876 --> 22:10.501
<i>I'm tall...</i>

22:10.626 --> 22:12.084
<i>slim...</i>

22:12.792 --> 22:14.709
<i>with black skin...</i>

22:16.417 --> 22:18.751
<i>an ample bosom...</i>

22:18.876 --> 22:21.084
<i>Attention, passing train platform 1</i>

22:22.376 --> 22:23.376
<i>Hello?</i>

22:26.042 --> 22:27.334
<i>Hello?</i>

22:33.626 --> 22:35.668
<i>Adorn, you clever fox.</i>

22:35.792 --> 22:38.667
<i>You hear my voice,
but you don't know who I am.</i>

22:40.917 --> 22:42.751
Throw yourself under a train.

22:42.876 --> 22:44.376
<i>What did you say?</i>

22:44.501 --> 22:46.542
Go and throw yourself
under a train.

22:48.084 --> 22:51.001
<i>The secret lies in the filtered frequencies
through the phone.</i>

22:57.417 --> 23:00.167
<i>Phone-walking

23:00.292 --> 23:02.501
<i>by a Japanese neurologist.</i>

23:05.459 --> 23:07.209
<i>...by a Japanese neurologist.</i>

23:12.584 --> 23:14.334
<i>...black skin...</i>

23:17.126 --> 23:19.042
<i>...black skin...</i>

23:37.501 --> 23:39.042
Watering can,

23:39.167 --> 23:40.751
apples,

23:40.876 --> 23:42.084
four beers,

23:42.501 --> 23:44.417
gardening magazine...

23:53.042 --> 23:54.251
...tights.

23:56.209 --> 23:57.959
Yellow tights.

24:12.126 --> 24:14.334
Melon flavour.

24:25.292 --> 24:27.334
I'd like to invite you for a drink.

24:31.834 --> 24:33.334
OK.

24:47.876 --> 24:52.834
THAT'S NOT ME.
AND THIS PLACE MAKES ME SICK.

25:30.084 --> 25:32.167
- Hello.
- Return our items.

25:33.084 --> 25:35.709
- What?
- Return our items!

25:36.459 --> 25:37.917
You want me to return what?

26:05.209 --> 26:06.334
Miaow...

26:07.751 --> 26:10.417
- Miaow!
- Go away, I don't have a cat.

26:17.042 --> 26:18.709
Come on, drink!

26:18.834 --> 26:20.209
Here. Drink!

26:20.334 --> 26:22.042
You stupid pig.

26:22.917 --> 26:24.584
You're a stupid pig!

26:27.626 --> 26:28.834
<i>Adorn and son.</i>

26:28.959 --> 26:32.376
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.
We thank you.</i>

26:36.584 --> 26:39.584
<i>The first time is always painful,</i>

26:39.709 --> 26:41.501
<i>but unforgettable.</i>

26:51.376 --> 26:53.042
<i>The easiest way...</i>

26:56.459 --> 26:58.959
<i>...is to press your forehead
against the wall.</i>

27:00.209 --> 27:02.167
<i>Then you picture us</i>

27:02.292 --> 27:05.751
<i>meeting on
the other side of the wall.</i>

27:05.876 --> 27:08.834
<i>Through the wall
into the forest, for instance.</i>

27:12.334 --> 27:13.834
<i>Then you picture us</i>

27:14.417 --> 27:17.167
<i>meeting on
the other side of the wall.</i>

27:18.167 --> 27:20.876
<i>Through the wall
into the forest, for instance.</i>

27:31.376 --> 27:33.209
<i>Our voices generate an image.</i>

27:34.459 --> 27:36.876
<i>Our words set them in motion.</i>

27:38.626 --> 27:41.834
<i>Besides one's imagination,
hearing is the most important thing.</i>

27:41.959 --> 27:44.709
<i>It's the interface
between our thoughts.</i>

27:46.167 --> 27:47.876
<i>Technically speaking, phone-walking...</i>

28:12.084 --> 28:14.292
We're in the forest now.

28:17.042 --> 28:19.417
Things are creeping and crawling
in the forest.

28:21.792 --> 28:23.751
Trees, wood...

28:24.334 --> 28:27.334
- The wind is blowing.
- <i> Out of yourarse.</i>

28:27.459 --> 28:31.001
<i>You don't even have the imagination
to picture a fir cone. Bye!</i>

28:32.501 --> 28:34.167
Wait, young lady.

28:34.292 --> 28:36.001
I wasn't focusing.

28:45.292 --> 28:49.084
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

28:50.042 --> 28:51.376
Three...

28:52.042 --> 28:54.042
two... one.

28:54.167 --> 28:57.417
<i>You feel the leaves
under your feet.</i>

29:05.376 --> 29:07.042
<i>The more you relax,</i>

29:07.167 --> 29:09.501
<i>the easier it gets to stay inside.</i>

29:10.334 --> 29:12.167
<i>What does it smell like?</i>

29:14.959 --> 29:18.334
<i>The tree sap is thick and sticky.</i>

29:19.334 --> 29:21.292
The camera and the tapes!

29:23.709 --> 29:25.667
<i>I smelled your tummy on the bus.</i>

29:25.792 --> 29:28.334
<i>It stinks of rotten apples.</i>

29:30.792 --> 29:32.584
<i>Why don't you throw yourself
under a train.</i>

30:26.417 --> 30:27.917
Hello?

30:28.042 --> 30:30.001
<i>Mr Adorn ?
This is the caretaker.</i>

30:30.751 --> 30:33.626
<i>There's a parcel
for you down here.</i>

30:33.751 --> 30:36.084
<i>I'll bring it up for a beer.</i>

30:45.167 --> 30:47.376
<i>Should I bring it up or not?</i>

30:48.917 --> 30:50.167
<i>Over.</i>

30:52.001 --> 30:53.834
No, we thank you.

30:56.167 --> 30:57.501
Over.

31:00.584 --> 31:03.376
ADORN & CLONE

32:24.417 --> 32:25.709
<i>Mrs Schoch speaking.</i>

32:25.834 --> 32:28.084
<i>I wanted to thank you
for the tapes.</i>

32:29.126 --> 32:30.751
<i>The divorce has gone through.</i>

32:31.834 --> 32:33.834
<i>I hope your boss is feeling better.</i>

32:34.626 --> 32:36.709
<i>Goodbye, Mr Adorn.</i>

33:25.501 --> 33:27.376
We have the sheep
and are coming down.

33:29.459 --> 33:31.417
She stole it from the children's zoo.

33:32.917 --> 33:33.959
See you later.

33:37.959 --> 33:40.042
You've got something
in your hair.

34:06.959 --> 34:09.001
Harald was an honest employer

34:09.126 --> 34:12.542
who stayed true to himself
and his employees until the end of his life.

34:13.751 --> 34:16.333
May he rest in peace, amen.

34:47.042 --> 34:48.917
<i>First new message.</i>

34:49.042 --> 34:50.417
<i>Hello, it's me again.</i>

34:50.542 --> 34:53.292
<i>I wanted to apologise
for the phone terror.</i>

34:54.542 --> 34:56.458
<i>I just wanted to talk a bit.</i>

34:58.126 --> 35:00.292
<i>Take care of your cat.</i>

35:00.417 --> 35:02.417
<i>It helps against melancholia.</i>

35:03.876 --> 35:05.209
<i>Bye.</i>

36:43.959 --> 36:45.626
If you ask me,

36:46.584 --> 36:47.792
I think we came too late.

36:47.917 --> 36:51.084
A bottle of booze and
seven grams of tranquillisers.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.417
She worked at the zoo.

36:52.542 --> 36:56.292
They usually use this stuff
to put down gorillas and cats.

36:57.042 --> 36:58.834
What will happen
to the iguana?

36:58.959 --> 37:01.584
I'll probably have to deal with it.

37:12.376 --> 37:14.168
<i>Do you have a vacuum cleaner?</i>

37:42.417 --> 37:44.000
Cat?

37:44.126 --> 37:45.876
Yum-yum.

37:47.667 --> 37:49.126
Eat, eat!

37:51.251 --> 37:52.709
Munch...

38:12.876 --> 38:14.334
Excuse me...

38:15.834 --> 38:17.876
Mr Adorn, what's the matter?

38:18.834 --> 38:22.709
I just wanted to ask
what's going to happen to the iguana.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.834
The one from the lady
from flat 146.

38:25.959 --> 38:28.542
It's downstairs, in the basement.

38:28.667 --> 38:30.876
The Salvation Army
doesn't want it.

38:31.001 --> 38:32.251
Could you hold this?

38:33.834 --> 38:37.001
Nobody got in touch.
No relatives, nothing.

38:39.376 --> 38:40.917
Why are you asking?

38:43.001 --> 38:44.584
Do you want to feed it?

38:45.459 --> 38:47.042
You'd be welcome to do that.

38:48.501 --> 38:51.042
You'd be doing me
a huge favour.

38:51.167 --> 38:54.000
I'll bring it up in a minute,
including the feeding and watering plan...

38:54.126 --> 38:57.376
No, you got the wrong end of the stick.

39:12.834 --> 39:15.584
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

39:15.709 --> 39:20.001
If anyone's listening,
this is Adorn, flat 149.

39:22.959 --> 39:27.376
I just wanted to inform you
that the reptile is in our care...

39:29.126 --> 39:30.417
...for one or two days.

41:01.417 --> 41:04.626
<i>You don't even have the imagination
to picture a fir cone.</i>

41:11.126 --> 41:12.709
Moss.

41:15.334 --> 41:17.126
It smells of moss, doesn't it?

41:17.709 --> 41:20.126
<i>The more you relax,</i>

41:20.251 --> 41:22.501
<i>the easier it gets to stay inside.</i>

41:32.417 --> 41:35.001
<i>Why don't you throw yourself
under a train.</i>

41:42.126 --> 41:44.417
<i>Please leave a message after...</i>

42:28.001 --> 42:30.959
THANKS FOR WATERING
AND FEEDING.

42:31.917 --> 42:34.917
"Thanks for watering
and feeding."

42:36.834 --> 42:39.334
YOU'RE ALIVE?
WHERE ARE YOU?

42:47.542 --> 42:50.626
AT THE MORGUE,
WAITING FOR COFFIN.

43:03.542 --> 43:06.876
"At the morgue, waiting for coffin."

43:46.167 --> 43:48.376
Behind the big spruce

43:48.501 --> 43:50.584
is where I stand.

43:57.376 --> 44:00.709
<i>This phone- walking thing
was just a bad joke.</i>

44:05.834 --> 44:08.417
- <i>Look for someone else.</i>
- But I wanted to say...

44:08.542 --> 44:10.126
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

44:10.251 --> 44:12.334
The cat is feeling...

44:14.626 --> 44:16.001
...better.

44:20.501 --> 44:22.792
<i>Can you feel him kicking?</i>

44:22.917 --> 44:24.292
<i>He wants to get out.</i>

44:24.417 --> 44:26.334
<i>It must be a bit lonely in there.</i>

44:27.167 --> 44:29.876
<i>I'm getting cold, darling.
Can we go to your place, please?</i>

44:30.001 --> 44:31.709
<i>I'd rather not, Kathrin.</i>

44:31.834 --> 44:34.376
<i>We always meet outside.
Do you have something to hide?</i>

44:34.501 --> 44:36.584
<i>What do you mean, "hide"?</i>

44:36.709 --> 44:38.917
<i>You never take me to your place.</i>

44:43.667 --> 44:45.376
<i>What do you mean, "hide"?</i>

44:45.501 --> 44:47.417
<i>You never want to take me
to your place.</i>

46:34.417 --> 46:36.876
I thought, well...

46:37.001 --> 46:39.584
as you don't want to go
to the forest...

46:40.417 --> 46:45.126
I thought, well...
we could invite you here.

46:45.251 --> 46:47.001
To the Adorn's.

46:47.126 --> 46:49.584
Flat 149.

46:50.834 --> 46:54.001
<i>I'd prefer it
if the caretaker watered my plants.</i>

46:59.876 --> 47:03.293
It's easier,
if you close your eyes.

47:03.417 --> 47:06.125
Three... two... one...

47:06.251 --> 47:07.792
Let's go!

47:07.917 --> 47:09.876
<i>When you walk through the door,</i>

47:10.667 --> 47:13.417
after seven steps

47:13.542 --> 47:15.126
you reach the living room.

47:16.042 --> 47:20.376
The flat is about
three times the size of yours.

47:21.167 --> 47:24.501
The curtains are brown,

47:25.626 --> 47:28.751
matching the bottle-green
of the sofa.

47:31.334 --> 47:32.626
<i>And...</i>

47:33.876 --> 47:35.626
they smell of...

47:37.709 --> 47:39.542
table-top grill.

47:41.584 --> 47:44.001
We always have that
on New Year's Eve.

47:44.751 --> 47:46.667
<i>Take five steps back</i>

47:46.792 --> 47:49.126
and you're sitting
on the sofa.

47:49.251 --> 47:51.042
It's a three-seater.

48:02.459 --> 48:04.209
<i>It sounds like walking on snow.</i>

48:16.959 --> 48:20.376
We used to go to the New Year's party
of the Detective Association.

48:20.501 --> 48:22.084
There was always a raffle.

48:22.209 --> 48:25.584
<i>In 1989,
the main prize was a fridge.</i>

48:26.459 --> 48:29.959
That was the last time we went.

48:34.376 --> 48:35.376
<i>Why?</i>

48:40.376 --> 48:43.876
Three... two... one.

48:46.417 --> 48:47.917
<i>Hello?</i>

48:49.584 --> 48:52.876
There was an incident
during an assignment.

48:54.251 --> 48:57.126
Afterwards, they were talking
behind our backs.

48:57.251 --> 49:00.292
Some thought,
we should have intervened.

49:00.417 --> 49:02.084
<i>Why didn't you?</i>

49:05.834 --> 49:08.626
The baker bakes bread,
the fisherman catches fish,

49:08.751 --> 49:10.251
and the investigator investigates.

49:11.042 --> 49:13.834
But some investigators
also steal cats.

49:17.709 --> 49:19.292
And sheep?

49:20.501 --> 49:22.042
What are they good for?

49:25.626 --> 49:27.126
<i>Is the tour finished?</i>

49:27.251 --> 49:30.168
<i>Or do you want to introduce me
to your vacuum cleaner?</i>

49:34.417 --> 49:38.292
At least 5,000 hours of film.

49:38.876 --> 49:40.792
You're definitely a bit sick.

49:40.917 --> 49:42.376
<i>Aren't you?</i>

49:43.334 --> 49:46.917
May I ask in which institution
you are staying?

49:56.042 --> 49:59.584
Hiking group 5, counting...

50:00.584 --> 50:02.167
One...

50:03.001 --> 50:06.501
<i>Hiking group 5, counting...</i>

50:07.501 --> 50:08.917
<i>One...</i>

50:14.209 --> 50:15.501
<i>Two...</i>

50:38.626 --> 50:40.084
Hello.

51:07.292 --> 51:08.417
Hello.

51:18.584 --> 51:21.167
I have to admit,
your shithole is quite classy.

51:21.292 --> 51:23.334
<i>But I have to eat now.</i>

51:44.417 --> 51:47.334
IN THE COFFIN NOW.
GOOD NIGHT.

53:22.167 --> 53:24.376
<i>Everything that moves us,</i>

53:26.126 --> 53:28.167
<i>is in our head.</i>

53:32.376 --> 53:34.334
<i>It's within ourselves.</i>

53:37.001 --> 53:39.042
<i>And that's what counts.</i>

54:17.834 --> 54:19.334
Vera.

54:31.459 --> 54:33.251
Adorn...

54:33.376 --> 54:35.542
Aloys Adorn.

54:43.459 --> 54:45.459
<i>Don't you have any milk?</i>

54:50.251 --> 54:52.292
There's magnesium inside.

54:52.417 --> 54:54.292
<i>Cat medicine cheers me up.</i>

55:07.959 --> 55:09.876
Where do you know this tune from?

55:10.001 --> 55:11.626
<i>Your father on the piano.</i>

55:11.751 --> 55:13.584
<i>I've watched all the videos.</i>

55:13.709 --> 55:15.709
<i>The one with the piano
is my favourite.</i>

55:55.292 --> 55:56.626
<i>What's the matter?</i>

55:56.751 --> 55:59.584
He doesn't like it,
when I sit at the piano.

56:00.626 --> 56:01.834
Let's play standing up then!

56:09.667 --> 56:11.042
Come on!

56:11.917 --> 56:13.292
Silence!

56:14.542 --> 56:15.917
I want to sleep!

56:16.042 --> 56:20.542
And why don't you learn
to play the piano?

56:33.834 --> 56:34.959
I've invited him.

56:41.501 --> 56:43.334
What?

56:44.167 --> 56:45.501
We'll be with you in a second.

56:48.209 --> 56:52.376
Shouldn't you be resting,
you seem so tipsy.

56:52.501 --> 56:54.334
<i>Tipsy?</i>

56:57.167 --> 57:00.042
<i>I wanted to liven up this shithole,</i>

57:00.167 --> 57:03.251
<i>so you don't suffocate
in your own dust.</i>

57:03.959 --> 57:05.292
Cheers!

57:06.417 --> 57:09.209
OK, they can stay for a short while,
if they behave themselves.

57:09.334 --> 57:10.542
I'll make an exception.

57:53.792 --> 57:56.334
Black, white, white, black.

01:00:13.126 --> 01:00:15.167
Vera, I'm lost.

01:00:15.292 --> 01:00:17.167
<i>Go to the radiator.</i>

01:00:20.292 --> 01:00:22.209
- And what now?
- <i>Spread your toes,</i>

01:00:22.334 --> 01:00:24.292
and clutch the radiator.

01:01:39.417 --> 01:01:40.875
And what now?

01:01:57.334 --> 01:01:59.209
That's out of the question!

01:02:09.834 --> 01:02:11.001
Hello, everybody.

01:02:12.334 --> 01:02:14.501
Welcome to my shithole.

01:02:22.917 --> 01:02:27.167
I already know some of you...
by sight.

01:02:45.459 --> 01:02:49.292
I film how you eat, how you sleep,
how you're awake...

01:02:52.334 --> 01:02:54.167
how you cook spaghetti,

01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:56.417
kiss, sing, make love,

01:02:56.542 --> 01:02:59.167
ride on the bus, get married.

01:02:59.292 --> 01:03:01.042
That's my job.

01:03:03.792 --> 01:03:07.667
At home I watch it all again.
And again and again.

01:03:10.292 --> 01:03:12.084
That's my hobby.

01:03:27.501 --> 01:03:29.584
Like a big party...

01:03:30.376 --> 01:03:32.292
outside your window.

01:03:32.417 --> 01:03:34.376
But you're not invited.

01:03:41.834 --> 01:03:43.834
How do you mean?

01:03:49.001 --> 01:03:50.542
Never mind.

01:03:52.626 --> 01:03:54.876
Today is a special party.

01:03:55.001 --> 01:03:57.334
And we're invited too,
as far as I know.

01:04:00.542 --> 01:04:03.959
The dance floor is open!

01:05:34.459 --> 01:05:36.001
To go?

01:05:38.792 --> 01:05:40.459
To eat here.

01:05:43.959 --> 01:05:45.834
Two portions, please.

01:05:52.667 --> 01:05:55.709
Yum, the Chinese

01:05:55.834 --> 01:05:59.251
are truly sophisticated cooks!

01:06:05.376 --> 01:06:08.417
And Lee's dancing steps yesterday...
meticulous.

01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:18.917
Do the people know
what happened?

01:06:30.292 --> 01:06:31.876
Stop it!

01:06:38.001 --> 01:06:39.834
I meant,
what happened to me?

01:06:45.667 --> 01:06:48.709
Do people know
what happened to me?

01:06:48.834 --> 01:06:51.459
They're just talking,
they're bored.

01:06:52.626 --> 01:06:54.376
Does it bother you?

01:07:00.167 --> 01:07:03.626
I don't care
what the neighbours think of me.

01:07:03.751 --> 01:07:05.292
Hello, Mr Detective.

01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:11.167
I like the gap
between your teeth.

01:07:11.959 --> 01:07:15.001
Is it true that you
regularly call a sex line,

01:07:15.126 --> 01:07:16.501
since your father died?

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:21.084
- What?
- I don't have a gap between my teeth.

01:07:22.876 --> 01:07:26.001
You only saw me
when the ambulance arrived.

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:29.667
- And I didn't smile then, did I?
- Mr Detective...

01:07:34.876 --> 01:07:36.334
Are you bored?

01:07:45.584 --> 01:07:47.542
<i>Hiking group 5.</i>

01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:49.417
<i>Counting...</i>

01:08:00.167 --> 01:08:04.751
<i>I thought we could go
to the big zoo,</i>

01:08:04.876 --> 01:08:06.542
<i>where you worked.</i>

01:08:06.667 --> 01:08:08.501
You'll have to go on your own.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:09.834
<i>How come?</i>

01:08:09.959 --> 01:08:11.459
I can no longer
show my face there.

01:08:23.626 --> 01:08:25.334
<i>Dear animal lovers,</i>

01:08:25.459 --> 01:08:28.542
<i>welcome to our exclusive audio tour
through the zoo.</i>

01:08:33.251 --> 01:08:35.126
<i>The second largest one
with the bright shell...</i>

01:08:35.959 --> 01:08:37.501
<i>Can you see her?</i>

01:08:39.001 --> 01:08:40.709
Yes, I do.

01:08:40.834 --> 01:08:42.417
<i>That's Nigrita.</i>

01:08:42.542 --> 01:08:44.042
<i>She's 75.</i>

01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:47.209
She was single for 20 years.

01:08:47.334 --> 01:08:49.042
Living alone in her cage.

01:08:51.209 --> 01:08:52.792
Imagine that.

01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:54.667
20 years...

01:08:56.751 --> 01:08:58.042
...in solitary confinement.

01:08:59.334 --> 01:09:01.001
But she endured.

01:09:01.667 --> 01:09:03.126
Without complaining.

01:09:04.251 --> 01:09:05.751
<i>No antidepressants, nothing.</i>

01:09:08.792 --> 01:09:10.667
And then Jumbo turned up.

01:09:21.001 --> 01:09:23.209
You can't miss him.

01:09:24.042 --> 01:09:26.459
<i>Can you see the marks
on her shell?</i>

01:09:26.584 --> 01:09:27.917
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

01:09:28.626 --> 01:09:30.667
That's from fucking
all the time.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:34.251
<i>The female is underneath
and Jumbo is very heavy.</i>

01:09:35.792 --> 01:09:38.542
- They seem to be happy.
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:09:49.126 --> 01:09:50.709
What's the matter?

01:09:51.876 --> 01:09:53.376
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:10:27.667 --> 01:10:30.084
The one with the white spot
on her snout...

01:10:36.459 --> 01:10:37.834
...that's Farah.

01:10:40.667 --> 01:10:42.834
Farah believes
she's still in the Atlantic...

01:10:43.959 --> 01:10:46.459
...and always swims into the glass.

01:10:48.042 --> 01:10:50.959
<i>She forgets it every time.</i>

01:10:51.084 --> 01:10:53.042
<i>She swims back...</i>

01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:57.209
<i>...and tries to remember.</i>

01:10:58.459 --> 01:11:00.501
<i>You're no longer
in the Atlantic, Farah.</i>

01:11:00.626 --> 01:11:02.251
You're no longer
in the Atlantic, Farah.

01:11:02.376 --> 01:11:04.459
<i>You're no longer in the Atlantic.</i>

01:11:04.584 --> 01:11:06.917
<i>You're no longer, no longer...</i>

01:11:10.001 --> 01:11:11.376
Bang!

01:11:16.376 --> 01:11:18.584
Luckily, she's so forgetful.

01:11:24.334 --> 01:11:26.501
Now I've ruined it.

01:11:30.167 --> 01:11:32.501
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:11:32.626 --> 01:11:34.501
<i>It gets too personal for you.</i>

01:11:35.376 --> 01:11:36.876
<i>You prefer it,
when I play the piano.</i>

01:11:37.834 --> 01:11:39.334
<i>Vera?</i>

01:11:48.417 --> 01:11:49.709
Vera?

01:11:51.542 --> 01:11:52.792
Vera!

01:11:53.501 --> 01:11:55.334
- Vera, now..
- What?

01:11:56.042 --> 01:11:57.584
What's the matter with you, Vera?

01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:59.751
<i>That's the best question
you've asked so far.</i>

01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:03.834
<i>But the answer won't fit
through the phone.</i>

01:12:04.959 --> 01:12:06.709
<i>I'll hang up now.</i>

01:12:40.959 --> 01:12:43.709
- Vera?
- <i>This is our last phone call.</i>

01:12:43.834 --> 01:12:45.459
<i>Enjoy it.</i>

01:12:45.584 --> 01:12:47.334
I'm on my way back now.

01:12:48.042 --> 01:12:49.667
Have you heard me?

01:12:49.792 --> 01:12:51.501
<i>Back where?</i>

01:12:52.417 --> 01:12:53.667
Well, back to you!

01:12:55.126 --> 01:12:56.876
No, not back to me.

01:12:57.001 --> 01:12:58.542
You're going to her.

01:12:58.667 --> 01:13:00.292
<i>I don't know who she is.</i>

01:13:01.292 --> 01:13:03.084
<i>She has my voice and
a gap between her teeth.</i>

01:13:03.209 --> 01:13:04.376
That's all I know about her.

01:13:04.501 --> 01:13:07.626
Our voices generate an image.

01:13:07.751 --> 01:13:10.292
Our words set it in motion.

01:13:11.084 --> 01:13:13.334
Whatever we imagine, Vera...

01:13:13.459 --> 01:13:15.501
What remains, is the essence.

01:13:17.042 --> 01:13:19.001
- No, Aloys.
- That's what you said.

01:13:21.042 --> 01:13:23.584
What's this damned
essence then, Adorn?

01:13:24.459 --> 01:13:27.709
I know exactly
how you felt at the time.

01:13:28.792 --> 01:13:29.834
When?

01:13:30.334 --> 01:13:31.876
<i>When you...</i>

01:13:36.126 --> 01:13:38.376
When you tried
to kill yourself.

01:13:39.876 --> 01:13:41.917
No, Aloys, you can't.

01:13:43.126 --> 01:13:44.709
Do you know why?

01:13:44.834 --> 01:13:47.667
Because you don't have a life
that could be taken away.

01:15:30.542 --> 01:15:31.959
<i>Aloys?</i>

01:15:36.084 --> 01:15:37.584
<i>Hello?</i>

01:16:15.584 --> 01:16:17.501
We have guests at the moment.
We thank you.

01:16:49.001 --> 01:16:50.459
Do you know what?

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:57.251
That party outside,
where I'm not invited...

01:17:00.667 --> 01:17:02.876
I don't want to be invited.

01:17:03.459 --> 01:17:05.292
It's not worth it.

01:17:06.876 --> 01:17:09.417
I've been observing it
for long enough.

01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:13.751
Every party
must come to an end,

01:17:13.876 --> 01:17:15.667
and left behind...

01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:17.834
are lonely people,

01:17:17.959 --> 01:17:19.751
who then go to the next party.

01:17:19.876 --> 01:17:21.834
And to the next one.

01:17:24.459 --> 01:17:26.876
Each time a bit lonelier.

01:17:30.459 --> 01:17:32.376
I'd rather stay here.

01:18:14.334 --> 01:18:17.417
We don't need this bed anymore.
Well, <i>he</i> doesn't.

01:18:20.376 --> 01:18:21.709
Yes...

01:18:21.834 --> 01:18:23.959
C'est la vie,
as he used to say.

01:18:24.084 --> 01:18:26.167
Everything still works.

01:18:27.376 --> 01:18:29.126
Fully functional.

01:18:30.042 --> 01:18:31.251
Yes.

01:18:32.167 --> 01:18:34.751
And a good day to you too.

01:19:35.751 --> 01:19:36.876
Hello?

01:19:37.001 --> 01:19:38.834
<i>We should go for a walk...</i>

01:19:39.917 --> 01:19:41.501
<i>...but without the phone.</i>

01:19:46.209 --> 01:19:47.709
<i>You don't want to.</i>

01:19:50.417 --> 01:19:52.209
What do you mean?

01:19:52.334 --> 01:19:53.459
<i>You don't want to see me.</i>

01:20:02.542 --> 01:20:04.376
But I do see you.

01:20:14.126 --> 01:20:15.584
Aloys?

01:20:45.459 --> 01:20:46.792
<i>Aloys, are you there?</i>

01:21:01.584 --> 01:21:04.126
Aloys, I know you're there.

01:21:24.917 --> 01:21:26.292
Vera?

01:21:31.876 --> 01:21:33.376
Aloys?

01:21:35.667 --> 01:21:37.167
- Vera?
- <i>I need to go back to the clinic.</i>

01:21:42.126 --> 01:21:43.709
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

01:21:47.042 --> 01:21:48.459
Vera?

01:22:24.626 --> 01:22:26.042
Vera?

01:22:26.167 --> 01:22:27.167
Vera!

01:22:28.042 --> 01:22:29.501
Vera!

01:22:45.667 --> 01:22:48.417
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

01:22:56.084 --> 01:22:58.959
That's not polite.
You should leave a message.

01:23:06.501 --> 01:23:08.751
Every party comes to an end,

01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:12.501
and left behind
are lonely people.

01:23:13.209 --> 01:23:14.626
Lonely people.

01:23:54.334 --> 01:23:55.751
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:26:13.542 --> 01:26:15.459
Good night, young man.

01:26:22.667 --> 01:26:25.001
Where's room 402?

01:26:41.459 --> 01:26:42.959
Good morning.
