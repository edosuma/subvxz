Would you look at that?

02:49.962 --> 02:50.963
Wow.

02:59.038 --> 03:00.405
Mr. Parker?

03:00.438 --> 03:01.406
Livingston?

03:01.439 --> 03:03.508
Yeah, just call me Thomas.

03:03.542 --> 03:05.377
Hey, I'm sorry, you
really startled me.

03:05.410 --> 03:07.847
You drive all the way up here?

03:07.880 --> 03:09.715
Yeah, well, it's
cheaper than flying.

03:09.749 --> 03:12.051
Stopped in a couple
of little motels.

03:12.084 --> 03:15.021
Sure the accommodations
here are a little nicer.

03:15.054 --> 03:15.955
You really think so?

03:17.422 --> 03:19.058
Well, more interesting, anyway.

03:20.392 --> 03:22.460
I stopped in town and
got some groceries.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.095
You wanna give me a hand and...

03:23.129 --> 03:24.462
You ready to go in?

03:25.998 --> 03:28.768
Yeah, sure, I'm
anxious to get inside.

03:38.543 --> 03:40.646
Ah, wow, this is great.

03:41.714 --> 03:43.481
This is really great.

03:43.515 --> 03:44.984
I think utility's turned on.

03:46.618 --> 03:47.987
Out of town cleaning
crew will come in

03:48.020 --> 03:50.089
and make the place presentable.

03:50.122 --> 03:52.591
No local outfit
will take the job.

03:52.624 --> 03:54.827
I think it's great
just the way it is.

03:54.861 --> 03:57.763
That package there
arrived for you yesterday.

03:59.464 --> 04:02.567
Oh, yeah,
this is my research.

04:04.136 --> 04:06.105
You already know the alarm code.

04:06.138 --> 04:09.108
This is the key
to the front door.

04:09.141 --> 04:10.475
It's a key to the gate.

04:11.443 --> 04:13.411
I'll lock the gate when I leave.

04:13.445 --> 04:15.014
Keep it locked at all times.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.082
What about the key
to the lighthouse?

04:16.115 --> 04:17.817
Don't get clever.

04:17.850 --> 04:21.019
Our agreement clearly states
that you are not to set foot

04:21.053 --> 04:23.723
in that tower under
any circumstance.

04:23.756 --> 04:25.490
Well, you can't blame
a guy for trying.

04:25.523 --> 04:28.160
I would've had the whole
thing torn down years ago

04:28.194 --> 04:31.631
if the Harper's Cove
Historical Society

04:31.664 --> 04:33.465
didn't make this
thing a landmark.

04:33.498 --> 04:34.566
Tear it down?

04:35.902 --> 04:37.435
Because of a few
little ghost stories?

04:37.469 --> 04:38.905
Stories are for children

04:40.840 --> 04:44.844
and adults with
childlike sensibilities.

04:44.877 --> 04:48.446
Well, I sure would like
to know your story.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.049
I'm not interested
in telling it.

04:51.183 --> 04:52.450
Enjoy your stay.

04:54.153 --> 04:56.588
I hope it's uneventful.

04:58.124 --> 05:02.028
All right, well, you have
a good day, Mr. Sunshine.

05:16.075 --> 05:17.843
You're not playing, Mr. Parker.

05:18.945 --> 05:20.012
Neither am I.

06:35.321 --> 06:38.224
In
1985, United Showcase Films

06:38.257 --> 06:40.592
rented the Widow's
Point Lighthouse

06:40.626 --> 06:43.829
as the location for the
movie "Rosemary's Spirit,"

06:43.863 --> 06:46.632
which filmed in Harper's
Cove for six weeks.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.835
Get the neutral density filter.

06:49.869 --> 06:50.736
Copy, Carlos.

06:52.204 --> 06:53.105
The gothic chiller

06:53.139 --> 06:55.274
was directed by Henry Rothchild

06:55.307 --> 06:58.277
and starred screen
veterans Garret Utley

06:58.310 --> 06:59.879
and Britney Langshire.

07:01.914 --> 07:06.318
Popular daytime actress Lydia
Pearl costarred as Rosemary.

07:25.204 --> 07:26.205
And it shall come.

07:27.273 --> 07:28.841
Well, darling, one more day

07:28.874 --> 07:30.910
and we'll be back in
hills of Hollywood.

07:30.943 --> 07:32.211
I'm counting the minutes.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.280
Not a fan of Harper's Cove?

07:34.313 --> 07:37.349
Not a fan of our
soap opera starlet.

07:37.383 --> 07:40.186
Oh, no worries there, she
won't be on the soaps for long.

07:40.219 --> 07:43.122
You know, she has
stolen this show.

07:43.155 --> 07:45.257
That's because she has
all the best lines.

07:45.291 --> 07:47.293
Next time, I'm thinking
maybe you'll wanna sleep

07:47.326 --> 07:49.295
with the writer instead
of the director.

07:50.763 --> 07:53.933
You're just jealous
'cause I got there first.

07:53.966 --> 07:56.202
I'm gonna miss that
charming wit of yours.

07:56.235 --> 07:57.602
Where is Lydia?

07:58.404 --> 07:59.738
She should be out
of Makeup by now.

07:59.772 --> 08:01.373
Come on, this is her last shot.

08:01.407 --> 08:03.075
Let's wrap her already.

08:04.743 --> 08:07.313
This is Karl, does anyone
have eyes on number three?!

08:09.682 --> 08:10.883
This is Mike.

08:10.916 --> 08:13.252
Number three went
10-1 20 minutes ago.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.320
I haven't seen her since.

08:14.353 --> 08:16.021
These actors are like children,

08:16.055 --> 08:18.257
you can't let them out of
your sight for a second.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.692
Toddlers with agents.

08:19.725 --> 08:22.394
- Exactly.
- Get her to set, now, Mike!

08:23.362 --> 08:24.396
Copy.

08:35.374 --> 08:36.408
Lydia, you in there?

08:41.380 --> 08:43.315
And it shall come.

08:43.349 --> 08:45.217
And it shall come.

08:45.251 --> 08:47.186
And it shall come.

08:47.219 --> 08:48.754
And it shall come.

08:48.787 --> 08:52.892
Lydia, sorry to interrupt,
but you're invited to set.

08:52.925 --> 08:54.460
And it shall come.

08:54.493 --> 08:55.761
And it shall come.

08:55.794 --> 08:56.695
Is everything okay?

08:56.729 --> 08:58.464
And it shall come.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.432
And it shall come.

09:00.466 --> 09:01.800
And it shall come.

09:01.834 --> 09:02.735
Lydia?

09:02.768 --> 09:04.370
And it shall come.

09:08.174 --> 09:09.441
Xa'niyus awaits!

09:09.475 --> 09:10.309
Lydia!

09:14.180 --> 09:15.748
I'm sorry.

09:15.781 --> 09:16.415
I'm sorry!

09:17.783 --> 09:18.417
Lydia!

09:19.785 --> 09:20.486
There's something
wrong with her,

09:20.519 --> 09:22.321
really, really wrong with her.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.424
All actresses are crazy,
don't you know that?

09:25.457 --> 09:26.325
Where is she now?

09:27.326 --> 09:28.494
I don't know.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.461
I lost her.

09:30.930 --> 09:32.831
How do you lose
another human being?

09:32.865 --> 09:34.266
You should've never
let her leave.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.268
What did you want me
to do, tie her up?

09:36.302 --> 09:37.136
Wait a minute.

09:38.170 --> 09:39.004
There she is.

09:44.443 --> 09:46.345
What the hell is she doing?

09:46.378 --> 09:48.514
And it shall come.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.449
And it shall come.

09:50.482 --> 09:51.383
And it shall come.

09:53.519 --> 09:55.454
What's this scene?

09:55.487 --> 09:56.822
Did you give her more to do?

09:56.855 --> 09:58.123
No, this isn't in the script.

09:58.157 --> 09:59.291
Not good, Henry.

09:59.325 --> 10:00.392
Lydia!

10:00.426 --> 10:02.294
Come down from there!

10:02.328 --> 10:04.096
And it shall come.

10:04.129 --> 10:05.831
And it shall come.

10:05.864 --> 10:07.366
And it shall come.

10:08.434 --> 10:10.369
Get her down here, now!

10:10.402 --> 10:11.237
Uh-huh.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.848
Two weeks
later, the security fence

10:22.881 --> 10:24.483
on the lighthouse
grounds went up.

10:25.851 --> 10:28.053
Lydia Pearl was the
most famous victim

10:28.087 --> 10:30.256
of the Widow's Point curse,

10:30.289 --> 10:32.291
but she was far
from the only one.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.365
How the hell is my
favorite client?

10:40.566 --> 10:42.234
Am I your favorite client?

10:42.268 --> 10:44.536
Well, you
are today, right now.

10:44.570 --> 10:45.938
Well, I'm touched.

10:45.971 --> 10:47.473
Here's the
million-dollar question:

10:47.506 --> 10:49.308
Where is my favorite client?

10:50.843 --> 10:53.412
I'm staying at the
Widow's Point Lighthouse

10:53.445 --> 10:54.580
in Harper's Cove.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.348
Okay, I'll bite.

10:56.382 --> 10:57.816
Where's Harper's Cove?

10:57.850 --> 10:59.385
Why don't you look it up?

10:59.418 --> 11:02.354
Supposed to be one of the most
haunted locations in America.

11:02.388 --> 11:03.222
Really?

11:04.323 --> 11:06.225
I like the sound of this.

11:06.258 --> 11:08.227
I thought you would.

11:08.260 --> 11:11.430
Abandoning his midlife
crisis, literary aspirations.

11:11.463 --> 11:16.268
Thomas Livingston returns to
the genre that made him famous.

11:17.503 --> 11:19.271
Well, you know,
divorce isn't cheap.

11:19.305 --> 11:20.539
I need the money.

11:20.572 --> 11:22.408
I've been begging you
to do this for years.

11:22.441 --> 11:23.842
Do you have an outline?

11:23.876 --> 11:25.544
No, I'm just here
doing research.

11:25.577 --> 11:27.513
Well,
how about a title?

11:27.546 --> 11:29.815
Right now, it's "Widow's Point."

11:31.050 --> 11:32.584
History of all the
horrible things

11:32.618 --> 11:34.053
that have happened
here over the years.

11:34.086 --> 11:35.287
Nonfiction?

11:35.321 --> 11:37.423
That's a
nihilistic approach.

11:37.456 --> 11:39.091
But it'll be scary, right?

11:39.124 --> 11:41.994
This is gonna be the scariest
thing I've ever written.

11:42.027 --> 11:44.196
That's all I need to hear
to get you an advance.

11:44.229 --> 11:45.431
There's one more thing.

11:45.464 --> 11:47.399
I'm gonna be the first
person in 30 years

11:47.433 --> 11:50.202
to stay in the actual
lighthouse itself.

11:50.235 --> 11:53.605
A publicity stunt,
I like this new you.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.607
I don't want anybody
to know about this

11:55.642 --> 11:57.543
until the book's been published.

11:57.576 --> 11:58.377
Okay?

11:59.345 --> 12:00.579
I will take care of that.

12:00.612 --> 12:02.348
Rosa will handle
the PR personally.

12:02.381 --> 12:04.583
Yeah, and get to work on
that advance, would you?

12:04.616 --> 12:06.518
Baby, you
know what I like.

12:06.552 --> 12:08.354
All right,
I'll be in touch.

12:14.393 --> 12:16.629
On August 3rd, 1933,

12:16.663 --> 12:18.564
lighthouse keeper
Patrick Collins

12:18.597 --> 12:21.634
invited his brother-in-law,
Joseph O'Leary,

12:21.668 --> 12:23.335
and two other men to play cards

12:23.369 --> 12:26.071
in the room located beneath
the lighthouse catwalk.

12:30.109 --> 12:33.245
Mwah.

12:33.278 --> 12:35.280
Patrick's wife Abigail

12:35.314 --> 12:37.483
tucked in their two
children for the night.

12:38.685 --> 12:39.885
Mama?

12:41.420 --> 12:42.454
Yes, Delaney?

12:42.488 --> 12:45.457
Will you tell Papa and Uncle
Joseph I said goodnight?

12:45.491 --> 12:47.326
Of course I will.

12:47.359 --> 12:48.460
And me?

12:48.494 --> 12:49.595
And you too, Stephen.

12:52.264 --> 12:53.332
Oh.

12:53.365 --> 12:54.366
Mwah.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.668
Goodnight, children.

13:01.741 --> 13:03.609
O'Leary
worked as a dock worker

13:03.643 --> 13:05.477
in Harper's Cove.

13:05.511 --> 13:08.947
A lifelong bachelor, he
was best known in town

13:08.981 --> 13:12.251
as the man who single-handedly
foiled a bank robbery

13:12.284 --> 13:13.653
when the culprit ran straight

13:13.686 --> 13:17.690
into his formidable chest.

13:20.727 --> 13:23.362
Okay, see what you got, girls.

13:23.395 --> 13:24.496
I got a pair.

13:24.530 --> 13:25.464
I got nothing.

13:26.699 --> 13:28.100
Feast your
eyes on these lovelies.

13:29.636 --> 13:31.671
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

13:31.704 --> 13:33.138
It's that damned Irish luck.

13:33.172 --> 13:34.674
I'm Irish, how come
I'm not winning?

13:34.707 --> 13:36.074
'Cause you're black Irish.

13:38.477 --> 13:40.145
All right, I'm gonna
go to the shitter.

13:40.179 --> 13:42.247
Pour me some more of that brown.

13:43.215 --> 13:44.616
It's some shitter.

13:44.651 --> 13:45.785
Yeah, I've
noticed you use it enough.

13:45.819 --> 13:49.154
Yeah, at my age, your
bladder can't be too choosy.

13:58.731 --> 14:00.365
"It's 'cause you're
black Irish."

14:23.555 --> 14:24.389
Abby?

14:26.358 --> 14:28.360
Wait, you're not my sis.

14:29.796 --> 14:31.764
Who are you, and what the
hell are you doing here?

14:33.633 --> 14:35.334
Well, answer me.

14:35.367 --> 14:36.636
What are you doing
here dressed like that?

14:36.669 --> 14:38.170
Little late for a wedding.

14:42.608 --> 14:44.543
Start squawking,
or I'll paste you!

14:53.252 --> 14:54.721
And it shall come.

14:58.557 --> 14:59.692
Xa'niyus awaits.

15:04.797 --> 15:07.099
Kill them all.

15:36.696 --> 15:38.731
Oh, my god.

15:43.903 --> 15:47.172
Boy, that
was quite the piss.

15:55.848 --> 15:57.082
Sorry.

15:59.151 --> 16:00.552
I'm dizzy.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.488
That's what you get for
drinking so much, you big ape.

16:09.161 --> 16:10.863
Hey, no come back?

16:10.897 --> 16:12.832
Well, he must really be sick.

16:12.865 --> 16:13.766
You do look awful.

16:14.901 --> 16:16.869
Hey, maybe you should
stay here tonight.

16:16.903 --> 16:18.303
Yeah.

16:18.337 --> 16:21.139
Maybe that's for the best.

16:21.173 --> 16:21.908
Abby and the kids
will be thrilled

16:21.941 --> 16:23.676
to see you when they wake up.

16:31.918 --> 16:33.385
Well, everyone's asleep.

16:33.418 --> 16:35.688
Help yourself to the icebox.

16:35.722 --> 16:36.923
I can't.

16:36.956 --> 16:38.223
I can't eat anything.

16:39.491 --> 16:40.459
You'll feel better
in the morning

16:40.492 --> 16:42.662
when you count your winnings.

16:42.695 --> 16:43.528
Goodnight.

17:06.853 --> 17:08.520
That
night, O'Leary composed

17:08.553 --> 17:10.757
the infamous rambling letter

17:10.790 --> 17:13.392
describing his
supernatural encounter.

19:03.002 --> 19:04.670
And it shall come.

19:18.751 --> 19:19.852
Oh, my god.

19:21.120 --> 19:21.921
Oh, Jesus.

19:28.593 --> 19:29.695
The next morning,

19:29.729 --> 19:31.596
fishermen found
O'Leary's body shattered

19:31.631 --> 19:33.532
on the ground below
the lighthouse.

19:43.075 --> 19:46.879
The police made a more
gruesome discovery inside.

19:46.913 --> 19:49.081
Patrick Collins was the
last lighthouse keeper

19:49.115 --> 19:50.448
at Widow's Point.

19:50.482 --> 19:52.752
No one ever lived there again.

20:09.836 --> 20:11.403
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

20:11.436 --> 20:13.039
Welcome to Widow's Point.

20:13.072 --> 20:15.975
I don't know whether to
be excited or scared.

20:16.008 --> 20:17.643
How about a little of both?

20:17.677 --> 20:18.978
Just park it right over there.

20:19.979 --> 20:20.813
All right.

20:27.153 --> 20:28.788
It doesn't look scary.

20:29.789 --> 20:32.624
Yeah, you should see it
when the sun goes down.

20:32.658 --> 20:34.093
I'm kidding.

20:34.126 --> 20:35.427
It's creepy as hell.

20:38.130 --> 20:39.031
Why are you doing this?

20:40.633 --> 20:42.635
You've never resorted
to gimmicks before.

20:44.136 --> 20:45.872
Yeah, well, look
where it got me.

20:46.939 --> 20:49.675
Besides, I wanna know the truth.

20:52.510 --> 20:53.112
Write that down.

21:00.152 --> 21:01.053
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

21:02.221 --> 21:06.125
Andre, this is my
publicist Rosa.

21:06.158 --> 21:08.127
Rosa, this is my
right hand man Andre.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.162
Welcome to Spook Central.

21:10.196 --> 21:12.031
Nice toys.

21:12.064 --> 21:14.700
Thanks, I make documentaries

21:14.734 --> 21:17.169
when I'm not shooting
commercials, so.

21:17.203 --> 21:18.638
Ah.

21:18.671 --> 21:20.006
Art versus commerce.

21:20.039 --> 21:21.707
- Mm.
- I feel your pain.

21:22.909 --> 21:25.177
Okay, I want you to
keep your eyes glued

21:25.211 --> 21:27.612
to this monitor all weekend.

21:27.647 --> 21:30.016
Okay, you got the best
seat in the house.

21:30.049 --> 21:31.516
Should've brought some popcorn.

21:33.551 --> 21:35.553
So Thomas's camera will transmit

21:35.587 --> 21:37.990
the footage he shoots
to this recorder.

21:38.024 --> 21:39.859
You'll listen to his audio
from his wireless mic

21:39.892 --> 21:41.459
over these speakers.

21:41.493 --> 21:42.594
- Got it?
- Yep.

21:44.096 --> 21:46.632
Guess I won't have much time
to get reading done, will I?

21:46.666 --> 21:47.900
Oh, you're wrong about that.

21:49.567 --> 21:51.737
This is the research
on Harper's Cove

21:51.771 --> 21:53.172
and Widow's Point Lighthouse.

21:53.205 --> 21:54.707
Mm.

21:54.740 --> 21:56.008
Even feels scary.

21:57.109 --> 21:59.045
All right, guys, Mr.
Parker is gonna be

21:59.078 --> 22:00.212
coming back any time,

22:00.246 --> 22:02.081
so let's get this thing
rolling, you know?

22:02.114 --> 22:05.084
And let's make some
history this weekend, huh?

22:05.952 --> 22:06.986
- Okay.
- All right.

22:08.254 --> 22:09.055
Okay, roll it.

22:09.088 --> 22:10.089
I mean, action.

22:13.192 --> 22:16.028
Hi, my name is
Thomas Livingston,

22:16.062 --> 22:19.165
and I am standing
outside of the legendary

22:19.198 --> 22:23.235
Widow's Point Lighthouse
in Harper's Cove.

22:23.269 --> 22:27.239
Built in 1838, it was named
for the widows of the sailors

22:27.273 --> 22:29.809
who died in shipwrecks below.

22:29.842 --> 22:31.243
In the decades that followed,

22:31.277 --> 22:34.080
nearly two dozen mysterious
incidents occurred,

22:34.113 --> 22:39.151
including disappearances,
suicide, and murder.

22:39.185 --> 22:43.255
Robert James Parker closed
the lighthouse in 1933.

22:43.289 --> 22:45.958
40 years later, his
son converted it

22:45.992 --> 22:49.161
into a naval museum
that lasted only a year.

22:49.195 --> 22:51.897
No human being has
occupied the lighthouse

22:51.931 --> 22:55.901
for almost 100 years,
that is, until now.

22:55.935 --> 22:58.137
I've arranged to spend
the entire weekend

22:58.170 --> 23:00.639
locked inside this
notorious landmark.

23:00.673 --> 23:03.209
I have no phone, no computer,

23:03.242 --> 23:06.312
no way to communicate
with the outside world.

23:06.345 --> 23:10.116
I'll be completely cut off
until that door is unlocked,

23:10.149 --> 23:12.218
Monday, at this same time.

23:13.285 --> 23:14.754
All right.

23:14.787 --> 23:15.855
Cut it.

23:15.888 --> 23:16.689
Nice work, Tom.

23:16.722 --> 23:18.157
You're a natural.

23:18.190 --> 23:20.192
This is all a joke to you.

23:20.226 --> 23:21.627
No, no, no.

23:21.660 --> 23:24.130
Mr. Parker, this is
not a joke, okay?

23:24.163 --> 23:26.232
I take it very seriously.

23:26.265 --> 23:27.800
Eh.

23:27.833 --> 23:29.601
Come on, you guys, let's
get the ball rolling.

23:35.307 --> 23:36.675
Walk this way.

23:38.711 --> 23:40.012
You're
making a mistake.

23:40.046 --> 23:41.180
Well,
that's your opinion,

23:41.213 --> 23:44.817
but you're paid well for my
use of the lighthouse, sir.

23:44.850 --> 23:46.018
This is Rosa.

23:46.052 --> 23:47.319
I have picture
from both cameras.

23:48.354 --> 23:49.255
Over.

23:49.288 --> 23:50.322
Copy.

23:51.190 --> 23:52.058
Good to go, Tom.

23:53.225 --> 23:54.060
All righty.

23:57.196 --> 24:00.833
No turning back now.

24:13.245 --> 24:14.680
Ah.

24:14.713 --> 24:16.115
And there she is.

24:24.356 --> 24:26.192
Woo.

24:26.225 --> 24:28.260
Sure does smell musky in here.

24:28.294 --> 24:29.161
It should.

24:29.195 --> 24:32.031
She's been breathing
dead air for 30 years.

24:35.367 --> 24:37.937
Definitely not taking the
cooler all the way up there.

24:37.970 --> 24:40.306
Come back down for water
and food when I need it.

24:41.774 --> 24:42.942
It's your show.

24:42.975 --> 24:45.277
I will see you on Monday.

24:47.379 --> 24:48.347
If you say so.

24:58.991 --> 25:01.026
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

25:02.128 --> 25:05.030
we begin our journey
into the heart

25:05.064 --> 25:07.032
of Widow's Point Lighthouse.

25:12.271 --> 25:14.273
I hope you're
getting this, Rosa.

25:14.306 --> 25:16.208
Every second, Tommy.

25:20.779 --> 25:22.414
All right, looks
good, sounds good.

25:23.249 --> 25:24.183
I'm taking off.

25:25.284 --> 25:27.052
Wait, you're leaving
me here alone?

25:27.086 --> 25:29.288
Yeah, my work here is done

25:29.321 --> 25:33.425
and I don't feel like
waiting around for no ghosts.

25:33.459 --> 25:36.128
There's my card if you
have any technical issues.

25:37.062 --> 25:38.230
Okay.

25:38.264 --> 25:39.064
All right.

25:39.098 --> 25:39.932
Adios.

25:54.046 --> 25:57.283
Well, looks like it's
just you and me, Tommy.

26:08.394 --> 26:10.162
The
Widow's Point Lighthouse

26:10.196 --> 26:15.067
has 69 steps, and I'm getting
to know each one, intimately.

26:20.372 --> 26:21.240
Wow.

26:25.344 --> 26:28.113
Looks like this
will be my penthouse

26:28.147 --> 26:29.481
for the next three nights.

26:33.852 --> 26:38.357
That is the table
where Patrick Collins

26:38.390 --> 26:40.492
played cards with
his brother-in-law.

26:44.230 --> 26:47.233
The air is thick and
stagnant in here,

26:48.934 --> 26:51.103
like something is
alive and waiting.

26:52.271 --> 26:54.073
Way to sell a story.

26:56.108 --> 26:58.777
Now, let's see what's up there.

27:11.890 --> 27:12.925
Spooky.

27:33.212 --> 27:34.046
Whoa.

27:40.552 --> 27:43.455
Mother Ocean as far
as the eye can see.

27:46.525 --> 27:47.426
It's almost enough

27:47.459 --> 27:49.061
to render me speechless.

27:51.230 --> 27:53.565
O'Leary leapt to
his death from here,

27:53.599 --> 27:55.501
and Lydia Pearl hung herself.

27:58.604 --> 28:00.506
I wonder, were there others?

28:16.989 --> 28:18.223
What is that?

28:31.303 --> 28:33.505
Looks like someone
left their mark here.

28:41.480 --> 28:42.981
I gotta get something to drink.

29:00.532 --> 29:02.468
My god, that's salty.

29:17.383 --> 29:20.619
That's salty too,
what's going on here?

29:22.187 --> 29:24.990
Okay, now you're
making me thirsty.

29:25.023 --> 29:25.624
22.

29:25.658 --> 29:26.659
23.

29:26.693 --> 29:27.493
24.

29:27.526 --> 29:28.494
25.

29:28.527 --> 29:29.328
27.

29:29.361 --> 29:30.162
28.

29:30.195 --> 29:31.296
29.

29:31.330 --> 29:32.131
30.

29:32.164 --> 29:32.965
31.

29:44.744 --> 29:48.080
The candlelit dinner for one?

29:48.113 --> 29:53.118
Hm?

29:53.585 --> 29:54.586
Mm.

29:54.620 --> 29:55.655
Mm.

29:55.688 --> 29:56.989
Here's looking at you, kid.

29:57.022 --> 29:58.457
- Mm.
- Back at you.

30:15.742 --> 30:18.477
In
2007, a local fisherman

30:18.510 --> 30:20.713
called the Harper's Cove police

30:20.747 --> 30:23.549
and reported seeing
someone on the catwalk

30:23.582 --> 30:26.018
of the Widow's Point Lighthouse.

30:26.051 --> 30:28.353
No one was supposed
to be up there,

30:28.387 --> 30:30.255
so Officer Richard Mellon,

30:30.289 --> 30:34.761
a third generation Harper's
Cove cop, drove out for a look.

30:34.794 --> 30:38.030
A car parked out front
belonged to Clifford McGee,

30:38.063 --> 30:39.766
a third-year photography major

30:39.799 --> 30:42.735
at Vanderton College
in Waterville, Maine.

30:42.769 --> 30:44.704
Two days earlier,
McGee left a note

30:44.737 --> 30:46.706
for his roommates
explaining he had found

30:46.739 --> 30:50.209
the perfect subject
for a photo essay.

31:10.562 --> 31:11.631
Clifford McGee?

31:13.633 --> 31:14.667
Are you okay?

31:17.135 --> 31:17.804
Hey.

31:26.078 --> 31:27.680
Hey.

31:27.714 --> 31:29.114
Hey!

31:31.416 --> 31:32.518
Hey, turn around...

31:32.551 --> 31:33.720
Oh!

31:33.753 --> 31:35.722
Whoa, easy.

31:35.755 --> 31:37.790
Easy, easy now.

31:37.824 --> 31:39.191
There we go.

31:39.224 --> 31:40.058
There we go.

31:40.727 --> 31:41.761
Calm down.

31:42.795 --> 31:43.796
That's it.

32:01.814 --> 32:03.348
That's better.

32:03.382 --> 32:04.216
There we go.

32:05.117 --> 32:06.552
Calm down.

32:06.585 --> 32:07.720
That's it.

32:07.754 --> 32:09.722
What do you say we, whoa.

32:09.756 --> 32:10.589
Whoa, whoa!

32:12.825 --> 32:14.159
What's gotten into you?

32:15.294 --> 32:17.563
Was the lighthouse
denied another victim?

32:18.497 --> 32:23.268
McGee is catatonic and
institutionalized to this day.

32:23.302 --> 32:26.605
Detectives examined the
memory card of his camera,

32:26.639 --> 32:30.342
128 megabytes, all full.

32:30.375 --> 32:33.579
Over 5,000 photos of the sea,

32:34.546 --> 32:36.716
all taken from the same angle

32:36.749 --> 32:39.117
from that same
spot on the catwalk

32:39.151 --> 32:43.088
over a 24-hour period
with no deviation.

32:44.089 --> 32:47.760
Two weeks later, Ronald Parker
installed security alarms

32:47.794 --> 32:50.697
throughout the lighthouse.

33:07.245 --> 33:10.415
I haven't opened this notebook
since I've gotten here.

33:15.520 --> 33:16.421
But it's open now.

33:17.122 --> 33:18.858
This writing wasn't here before.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.895
I've never seen it
before this moment.

33:26.465 --> 33:29.669
You really want that
bestseller, don't you?

34:07.674 --> 34:10.342
"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."

34:20.385 --> 34:22.487
Harper's Cove Gazette.

34:22.521 --> 34:25.590
August 4th, 1933.

34:29.661 --> 34:30.697
Looks like a journal.

34:37.036 --> 34:37.870
Delaney Collins.

34:42.274 --> 34:43.308
What the hell?

34:52.350 --> 34:52.952
Shit.

34:52.985 --> 34:54.453
Wait a minute.

34:54.485 --> 34:55.888
Yeah, I still hear you.

35:01.027 --> 35:03.428
DC, Delaney Collins.

35:07.900 --> 35:09.936
This should be interesting.

35:09.969 --> 35:12.571
- Hello?
- Andre, this is Rosa.

35:12.604 --> 35:14.006
Well, hey, what's up?

35:14.040 --> 35:15.574
I've lost picture
on the monitor,

35:15.607 --> 35:17.944
but I still have audio
from the camera mic.

35:17.977 --> 35:21.013
That doesn't make sense.

35:21.047 --> 35:23.582
Okay, well, I'm gonna need
you to get this working again.

35:24.717 --> 35:25.918
It's after
eight o'clock.

35:25.952 --> 35:27.486
I don't care.

35:27.519 --> 35:28.955
We rented your gear
for the weekend

35:28.988 --> 35:30.656
and we need it all weekend.

35:31.691 --> 35:33.025
All right, all right.

35:34.026 --> 35:35.895
Give me a half hour.

35:35.928 --> 35:37.362
Make it 20 minutes.

35:42.668 --> 35:44.904
"My name is Delaney Collins.

35:44.937 --> 35:47.840
"I'm 12 years old and
I live in a lighthouse

35:47.874 --> 35:52.377
"in Harper's Cove with my
parents and my brother.

35:53.880 --> 35:57.016
We moved here a
year ago, and I love it.

35:57.049 --> 35:58.050
Sometimes, it feels like

35:58.084 --> 36:00.887
I can see forever from here.

36:00.920 --> 36:04.824
Stephen is such a brat, but
he never gets in trouble.

36:04.857 --> 36:08.293
It's always my fault as
far as Father is concerned.

36:09.061 --> 36:11.998
Sometimes, I wish I
was an only child.

36:14.533 --> 36:17.737
Almost 100 years ago, when
the lighthouse was built,

36:17.770 --> 36:20.740
three men walking on the
catwalk fell to their deaths.

36:20.773 --> 36:22.074
No one knows why.

36:25.812 --> 36:27.914
Something is wrong here.

36:27.947 --> 36:30.315
Sometimes, it smells
dead and rotten.

36:31.449 --> 36:33.518
I see things from
the corner of my eye,

36:33.552 --> 36:36.055
like shadows that move
when they shouldn't.

36:36.088 --> 36:37.723
Nobody else sees them.

36:38.590 --> 36:41.027
Nobody else feels them.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.962
That doesn't mean
they aren't there.

36:44.030 --> 36:47.099
♪ This old man, he played one ♪

36:47.133 --> 36:49.735
♪ He played knick-knack
on my thumb ♪

36:49.769 --> 36:53.405
♪ With a knick-knack
paddywhack, give a dog a bone ♪

36:53.438 --> 36:57.910
♪ This old man
came rolling home ♪

37:39.517 --> 37:42.922
Hey,
what are you doing?

37:42.955 --> 37:45.925
If I see
her again, I'm telling Mama.

37:45.958 --> 37:47.059
I know what she'll say,

37:47.093 --> 37:51.097
"There's no such thing as
ghosts, Delaney Jane Collins,"

37:51.130 --> 37:52.031
but I don't care.

37:54.166 --> 37:57.103
I have to tell someone.

37:57.136 --> 38:00.172
I don't want to go to
sleep, because I'm scared.

38:53.626 --> 38:57.830
You, my dear, you
are far too old

38:57.863 --> 39:01.867
to be having such
dreams, Delaney Jane.

39:01.901 --> 39:03.202
It wasn't a dream.

39:03.235 --> 39:04.670
Okay.

39:04.704 --> 39:07.572
Well, then, it was
your imagination.

39:07.605 --> 39:10.109
No more "Legends of
Sleepy Hollow" for you.

39:10.142 --> 39:12.645
She was real.

39:12.678 --> 39:15.214
There is no such
thing as ghosts.

39:15.247 --> 39:17.116
I know what I saw.

39:17.149 --> 39:20.019
Then why didn't your
brother see her, hm?

39:20.052 --> 39:22.188
You sleep in the same room.

39:22.221 --> 39:23.723
He was asleep!

39:23.756 --> 39:26.926
Oh, sweetheart, so were you.

39:41.941 --> 39:44.576
I
snuck down to the beach.

39:44.609 --> 39:46.278
I know I shouldn't have.

39:46.312 --> 39:48.280
Father has warned
me it's dangerous,

39:48.314 --> 39:49.915
and Mother has made me promise

39:49.949 --> 39:52.018
to never go down
there without them.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.701
Delaney!

40:57.349 --> 40:59.018
Watch for poison ivy.

41:00.653 --> 41:01.220
One!

41:01.253 --> 41:02.254
Two!

41:02.288 --> 41:03.355
Three!

41:03.389 --> 41:04.190
Four!

41:04.223 --> 41:05.091
Five!

41:05.124 --> 41:06.125
Six!

41:06.158 --> 41:07.126
Seven!

41:07.159 --> 41:08.127
Eight!

41:08.160 --> 41:09.095
Nine!

41:09.128 --> 41:10.029
10!

41:10.062 --> 41:11.097
11!

41:11.130 --> 41:12.064
12!

41:12.098 --> 41:13.132
13!

41:13.165 --> 41:14.333
14!

41:14.366 --> 41:15.367
15!

41:15.401 --> 41:16.302
16!

41:16.335 --> 41:17.369
17!

41:17.403 --> 41:18.637
18!

41:18.671 --> 41:20.005
19! 20!

41:20.039 --> 41:25.044
Ready or not, here I come!

41:48.968 --> 41:50.736
Got you!

41:55.241 --> 41:56.242
What happened, Delaney?

41:56.275 --> 41:58.144
Stephen Patrick,
what did you do?

41:58.177 --> 41:59.712
Nothing, we were just playing.

41:59.745 --> 42:01.747
Delaney, why did you scream?

42:01.780 --> 42:03.349
I saw...

42:03.382 --> 42:04.316
You saw what?

42:06.252 --> 42:07.086
A rat.

42:11.457 --> 42:13.125
Don't worry, girl.

42:13.159 --> 42:15.928
No rat can hurt you
here, nothing can.

42:17.363 --> 42:18.864
I'll always keep you safe.

42:27.907 --> 42:29.008
The
lighthouse is playing

42:29.041 --> 42:29.942
games with me.

42:29.975 --> 42:32.411
This is a bad place.

42:32.444 --> 42:34.947
People aren't
meant to live here.

43:43.249 --> 43:44.049
Stay out!

43:44.083 --> 43:46.285
Don't come in here!

43:46.318 --> 43:47.386
I mean it!

43:47.419 --> 43:49.188
Don't come in here!

43:49.221 --> 43:50.522
I'm not afraid of you.

44:11.910 --> 44:12.544
Stephen?

44:27.059 --> 44:29.261
Stephen, give me that knife.

44:32.264 --> 44:33.065
Give it to me!

44:43.442 --> 44:46.478
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

44:48.080 --> 44:49.214
It's okay.

44:49.248 --> 44:50.516
Everything will be all right.

44:52.151 --> 44:54.186
Don't worry, I won't
tell Mama and Papa.

44:56.955 --> 44:59.325
My
prayers have been answered.

44:59.358 --> 45:01.293
The ghost is gone and
it's been three weeks

45:01.327 --> 45:02.528
since I had a nightmare.

45:03.896 --> 45:05.597
Tonight, Father has one of his

45:05.632 --> 45:08.100
Poker games in the lighthouse.

45:08.133 --> 45:10.002
I'll get to see Uncle Joseph.

45:11.638 --> 45:14.206
I'm looking forward
to a wonderful night.

45:31.357 --> 45:35.527
That poor, sweet, innocent
girl, butchered by a madman.

45:38.030 --> 45:40.199
It's almost too much to bear.

45:53.646 --> 45:54.980
This doesn't make any sense.

45:55.013 --> 45:56.048
Right, the only
reason we should have

45:56.081 --> 45:57.650
time code over solid black

45:57.684 --> 46:00.085
is if that Tom somehow
hit the record button

46:00.119 --> 46:01.487
with the lens cap still on.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.088
You can see he didn't do that.

46:03.122 --> 46:05.290
And he couldn't even reach
the camera from there.

46:05.324 --> 46:07.559
Could someone else
have done this?

46:07.593 --> 46:09.361
You think he's pulling a hoax?

46:10.663 --> 46:12.398
I don't know, without
image, no one can disprove

46:12.431 --> 46:15.000
anything he says is
happening in there.

46:15.033 --> 46:16.335
Plausible deniability.

46:17.603 --> 46:19.104
No one put a cap over the lens.

46:19.138 --> 46:21.340
Watch, it goes from
picture to black,

46:21.373 --> 46:23.609
picture to black,
picture to black.

46:23.643 --> 46:25.344
A cap never even
enters the frame.

46:26.311 --> 46:27.680
Oh, hold it.

46:29.314 --> 46:30.149
What?

46:31.617 --> 46:32.652
You see this?

46:33.318 --> 46:35.120
This is known as a flash frame.

46:35.154 --> 46:36.656
These used to happen
all the time in film,

46:36.689 --> 46:39.726
but we're working in digital,

46:39.759 --> 46:43.462
so I guess
it's a glitch.

46:44.596 --> 46:45.698
What is that?

46:46.666 --> 46:48.333
I don't know.

46:48.367 --> 46:49.601
Weird?

46:49.636 --> 46:52.571
Okay, well, can you do
anything with this image?

46:54.440 --> 46:56.008
I guess I could use
color correction

46:56.041 --> 46:57.443
to open up some more detail.

46:59.278 --> 47:00.112
Do it.

47:01.280 --> 47:02.481
We're gonna have
to stop recording

47:02.514 --> 47:03.650
while I transfer the
footage to my laptop.

47:03.683 --> 47:05.250
That could lead to accusations

47:05.284 --> 47:06.985
that we tampered
with the footage.

47:08.020 --> 47:09.621
Do it.

47:32.645 --> 47:33.445
Jesus.

47:35.113 --> 47:36.749
God, that's even
saltier than before.

47:47.059 --> 47:50.596
All right, I am knocking
down the exposure

47:50.630 --> 47:52.598
and opening up the detail.

47:55.635 --> 47:56.769
Voila.

47:56.803 --> 47:57.637
Oh, my god.

48:00.305 --> 48:01.273
Do you see her?

48:03.643 --> 48:05.778
I see something.

48:05.812 --> 48:08.681
Okay, Thomas is holding
Delaney Collins's journal.

48:08.715 --> 48:13.720
He says her name here, and
that's when the camera glitched.

48:14.787 --> 48:17.690
Delaney Collins, the little
girl that was murdered here?

48:17.724 --> 48:18.725
Yeah.

48:18.758 --> 48:20.325
Yeah, look.

48:20.359 --> 48:23.730
This is her right here, and
that sure looks like her too.

48:26.465 --> 48:27.332
Don't you see it?

48:28.668 --> 48:32.104
Again, I see something.

48:33.338 --> 48:35.775
How can you not see it?

48:35.808 --> 48:37.609
I don't know, people
see different things

48:37.644 --> 48:39.278
when they look at
the same cloud.

48:40.145 --> 48:42.114
No, that's her.

48:43.282 --> 48:44.116
I know it is.

48:45.350 --> 48:49.288
The question is, how
did he pull it off?

49:09.474 --> 49:10.309
Here.

49:11.443 --> 49:12.812
Found these in the closet.

49:12.845 --> 49:16.381
They're a little
dusty and mothy.

49:17.482 --> 49:18.317
Oh, good.

49:20.687 --> 49:21.587
Thanks for staying.

49:21.620 --> 49:24.724
I feel embarrassed for asking.

49:24.757 --> 49:26.124
Don't worry about it.

49:26.158 --> 49:28.160
I'd be afraid to
stay alone here too.

49:29.595 --> 49:31.463
Sure you don't wanna
stay in one of the rooms?

49:32.431 --> 49:35.534
No, I better stay up and
keep listening to Tom.

49:37.536 --> 49:39.538
Taking one for the team.

49:39.571 --> 49:40.405
Cool.

49:41.874 --> 49:44.777
Well, I'm gonna head to bed.

49:46.345 --> 49:48.848
I'll see you in the morning.

50:03.763 --> 50:05.364
Perfectly fine.

50:07.800 --> 50:08.635
Yee-hoo.

52:00.012 --> 52:00.747
It's late.

52:02.581 --> 52:03.983
I am exhausted.

52:08.955 --> 52:12.692
I will put the camera
in motion detector mode

52:15.427 --> 52:20.066
and I'll leave the audio
activated all night,

52:20.099 --> 52:23.736
and, hopefully, I
won't see anything

52:23.770 --> 52:26.806
incriminating in my sleep.

53:17.556 --> 53:18.691
What in the hell was that?

53:23.629 --> 53:25.665
Did you hear that?

53:25.698 --> 53:27.733
It sounded like footsteps.

53:35.007 --> 53:36.843
Hello, who's out there?!

53:43.983 --> 53:46.018
Where's my flashlight?

53:55.493 --> 53:56.128
What?

54:26.158 --> 54:27.592
Great, no lock.

55:26.018 --> 55:28.020
Where's that flashlight?

56:10.763 --> 56:13.132
It was absolutely
fine last night.

56:21.941 --> 56:23.109
What the hell?

56:34.220 --> 56:35.221
Oh, maggots.

56:37.757 --> 56:38.590
Oh, god.

56:47.967 --> 56:50.870
Doesn't that look
like a yummy meal?

56:57.343 --> 56:59.045
Good morning.

56:59.078 --> 56:59.879
Hey.

57:00.946 --> 57:01.847
How'd you sleep?

57:03.182 --> 57:04.150
Not good.

57:04.183 --> 57:05.951
That was some storm last night.

57:06.819 --> 57:08.154
Yeah, you're not kidding.

57:10.189 --> 57:11.791
How's our subject?

57:11.824 --> 57:13.292
Is that what he is?

57:13.325 --> 57:15.327
I thought we were
his captive audience.

57:16.796 --> 57:18.563
He's talking to
himself a lot more.

57:19.999 --> 57:21.333
Writers do that.

57:21.367 --> 57:23.669
He's probably just
rehearsing for an interview

57:23.702 --> 57:24.937
for Playboy or something.

57:27.306 --> 57:28.340
How about some breakfast?

57:30.209 --> 57:32.878
As long as it isn't
covered in maggots.

57:32.912 --> 57:33.846
Hm.

57:33.879 --> 57:35.014
Yum, glad you told me.

57:36.015 --> 57:36.849
Mm-hm.

57:38.117 --> 57:40.719
So, how are things in
Haunted House Land?

57:41.420 --> 57:43.789
He's playing us, Marshall.

57:43.823 --> 57:45.324
I don't know how, but
he's blocked the image

57:45.357 --> 57:47.927
from the camera, so
we're only getting audio.

57:47.960 --> 57:49.261
Why would he do that?

57:49.295 --> 57:51.097
So we can't see what's
going on in there,

57:51.130 --> 57:52.698
which is nothing.

57:52.731 --> 57:56.635
He's putting on his own radio
drama like Orson Welles.

57:58.104 --> 58:00.072
Sweetie, that's just
behind-the-scenes footage,

58:00.106 --> 58:01.273
like they do in all the movies.

58:01.307 --> 58:02.975
Don't get wrapped up in it.

58:03.008 --> 58:04.210
Let him do his thing.

58:04.243 --> 58:07.179
He's making us
accomplices to his hoax.

58:07.213 --> 58:09.181
This little weekend
excursion is gonna generate

58:09.215 --> 58:12.151
plenty of sexy copy once
his book is published.

58:12.184 --> 58:13.752
Did you get that
image I texted you?

58:13.786 --> 58:15.221
I really couldn't
make out too much,

58:15.254 --> 58:17.389
not with that light flare.

58:17.423 --> 58:18.958
Yeah, those are hotspots,

58:18.991 --> 58:21.894
commonly associated with
paranormal activity,

58:21.927 --> 58:23.028
which he wants us to believe.

58:23.062 --> 58:26.298
I really wish he worked that
hard on his last four books.

58:26.332 --> 58:28.734
And I hope this doesn't
blow up in our faces.

58:28.767 --> 58:30.002
You worry too much.

59:37.469 --> 59:39.271
Goddamn bullshit.

01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:17.109
Delaney.

01:00:18.177 --> 01:00:22.081
Delaney's right, that it's
really fucked up in here!

01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:38.430
Empty.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.341
Empty?

01:00:49.375 --> 01:00:50.175
Empty!

01:00:58.550 --> 01:00:59.351
Water.

01:01:10.562 --> 01:01:13.465
Someone's playing
games around here.

01:01:15.567 --> 01:01:16.802
Saltwater.

01:01:18.003 --> 01:01:18.837
Andre!

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.561
Sea.

01:01:42.594 --> 01:01:43.896
Seawater.

01:01:48.901 --> 01:01:49.501
Rosa!

01:01:52.538 --> 01:01:53.539
Help!

01:02:16.929 --> 01:02:17.563
Oh, god.

01:02:18.597 --> 01:02:20.899
Please, just stop.

01:02:20.933 --> 01:02:21.567
Please.

01:02:38.283 --> 01:02:39.652
Do you hear that?

01:02:41.587 --> 01:02:42.988
I don't hear anything.

01:02:46.024 --> 01:02:47.359
Exactly.

01:02:47.393 --> 01:02:48.628
We've lost audio now.

01:02:48.661 --> 01:02:51.330
There's nothing coming
through the mixer either.

01:02:51.363 --> 01:02:53.633
The signal has just stopped.

01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:54.634
See?

01:02:54.667 --> 01:02:55.901
No more time code.

01:02:56.703 --> 01:02:58.570
Couldn't it just
be the batteries?

01:02:59.571 --> 01:03:00.539
Not on our end.

01:03:15.354 --> 01:03:18.524
Okay, so I snuck a
phone in, big deal!

01:03:18.557 --> 01:03:19.525
Come on, answer.

01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:23.095
Come on.

01:03:25.597 --> 01:03:26.633
Come on.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:29.468
Hello?

01:03:29.501 --> 01:03:31.170
Now we've lost audio.

01:03:31.203 --> 01:03:33.338
You don't say.

01:03:33.372 --> 01:03:35.240
We have no idea what's
going on in there,

01:03:35.274 --> 01:03:37.142
or if Thomas is okay.

01:03:37.176 --> 01:03:39.611
What do you think is
happening in there?

01:03:39.646 --> 01:03:40.546
Nothing.

01:03:40.579 --> 01:03:42.548
Well, we have nothing
to worry about, then.

01:03:42.581 --> 01:03:44.249
This is all showmanship.

01:03:45.184 --> 01:03:46.985
I didn't think he had it in him.

01:03:47.019 --> 01:03:49.121
Do you mind if I
come home early?

01:03:49.154 --> 01:03:50.723
How early?

01:03:50.757 --> 01:03:51.557
Today.

01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:52.624
You sound scared.

01:03:54.059 --> 01:03:56.495
I'm a city girl, I
don't belong here.

01:03:56.528 --> 01:03:59.164
I need you there when Thomas
comes out of the lighthouse.

01:03:59.198 --> 01:04:02.067
This will be over
before you know it.

01:04:19.151 --> 01:04:20.419
Come on, you bitch.

01:04:28.594 --> 01:04:33.131
Worthless piece of shit!

01:04:39.639 --> 01:04:42.474
Where in the hell
did my phone go?

01:04:47.312 --> 01:04:49.147
Give me back my phone!

01:05:09.434 --> 01:05:10.737
Delaney!

01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:23.683
97.

01:05:24.817 --> 01:05:25.652
98.

01:05:27.286 --> 01:05:28.120
99.

01:05:29.856 --> 01:05:32.659
Should be 69 steps.

01:05:32.692 --> 01:05:35.193
Why haven't I
reached the top yet?

01:05:48.775 --> 01:05:50.777
I read Thomas's research
notes last night.

01:05:52.845 --> 01:05:57.282
In 1836, two years before
this lighthouse was built,

01:05:59.251 --> 01:06:00.653
a clipper ship called the Pisces

01:06:00.687 --> 01:06:02.154
sank out there during a storm.

01:06:04.423 --> 01:06:05.692
All hands were lost.

01:06:07.794 --> 01:06:09.461
A sailor named Jonah Burch

01:06:09.494 --> 01:06:11.296
left behind a widow
named Rebecca.

01:06:16.736 --> 01:06:19.304
Jonah and Rebecca made
their home in New Hampshire,

01:06:20.773 --> 01:06:22.642
and when Rebecca found out
about her husband's death,

01:06:22.675 --> 01:06:23.843
she came to Harper's Cove.

01:06:26.311 --> 01:06:30.817
She spent three nights in
town, and then disappeared.

01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:34.486
A week later, her broken body
was found on the rocks below.

01:06:34.519 --> 01:06:36.723
She was wearing
her wedding dress.

01:06:36.756 --> 01:06:38.624
The local doctors
determined that the fall

01:06:38.658 --> 01:06:41.426
broke several of her bones,
but it didn't kill her.

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:46.164
She suffered for days,
trapped on those rocks,

01:06:48.333 --> 01:06:50.670
before dying of exposure
and slow hemorrhaging.

01:06:53.806 --> 01:06:54.841
That's harsh.

01:06:55.975 --> 01:06:57.810
Rebecca
Burch is the widow

01:06:57.844 --> 01:06:59.244
this point is named after.

01:07:03.916 --> 01:07:05.785
200, will you look at that?

01:07:05.818 --> 01:07:07.352
201.

01:07:07.386 --> 01:07:08.220
202.

01:07:08.888 --> 01:07:09.922
203.

01:07:19.564 --> 01:07:20.399
Andre!

01:07:21.901 --> 01:07:22.735
Rosa!

01:07:24.937 --> 01:07:25.772
Rosa!

01:07:29.642 --> 01:07:30.910
Andre, help me!

01:07:33.813 --> 01:07:35.648
Oh, my, oh, my god.

01:07:36.916 --> 01:07:37.950
Jesus!

01:07:42.989 --> 01:07:44.589
Are they gone?

01:07:46.959 --> 01:07:47.794
Or am I?

01:07:53.532 --> 01:07:55.233
They're back.

01:07:55.267 --> 01:07:55.902
Rosa?!

01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:59.304
Rosa?!

01:08:36.042 --> 01:08:36.876
What?

01:08:45.051 --> 01:08:45.952
It's night.

01:08:48.755 --> 01:08:50.990
It can't be night already!

01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:18.850
It's not possible.

01:09:20.019 --> 01:09:20.953
It's nighttime.

01:09:33.064 --> 01:09:35.567
How the hell this get up here?

01:09:46.078 --> 01:09:49.514
If I had a rope, I
could just climb down.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.922
Or hang myself.

01:10:01.027 --> 01:10:04.462
Somehow, I lost an entire day.

01:10:06.966 --> 01:10:10.670
I know it's impossible,
but it happened.

01:10:15.407 --> 01:10:16.709
And now it's raining.

01:10:30.522 --> 01:10:33.025
Somebody wrote in my book.

01:10:40.766 --> 01:10:44.003
I admit I did it
the last time, okay?

01:10:44.036 --> 01:10:45.004
It was me, all right?

01:10:45.037 --> 01:10:47.740
I lied and I admit that.

01:10:47.773 --> 01:10:52.577
Whether out of showmanship
or bullshit or whatever,

01:10:54.046 --> 01:10:54.847
I lied.

01:10:57.549 --> 01:10:58.150
But this,

01:11:01.721 --> 01:11:03.022
this is real, okay?

01:11:04.522 --> 01:11:07.693
Somebody's fucking with me.

01:11:13.833 --> 01:11:16.135

you and all of your shame

01:14:27.259 --> 01:14:29.095
It's Sunday.

01:14:30.162 --> 01:14:30.996
Oh, no.

01:14:39.972 --> 01:14:42.808
I will not spend
it in this place!

01:14:46.946 --> 01:14:49.048
There's no way in hell!

01:14:54.386 --> 01:14:57.156
Everything's gonna be okay.

Everything's gonna be okay.

01:15:04.330 --> 01:15:07.399
I came here for the money.

01:15:10.302 --> 01:15:11.137
Of course I did.

01:15:13.806 --> 01:15:15.207
It's always about the money.

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:23.849
Something keeps
touching my face.

01:15:28.287 --> 01:15:30.089
I can feel its breath.

01:15:35.361 --> 01:15:39.798
It stinks!

01:15:39.832 --> 01:15:40.666
Monsters.

01:15:42.501 --> 01:15:47.706
This is madness.

01:15:54.747 --> 01:15:55.915
Get off of me!

01:15:58.184 --> 01:15:59.018
Oh!

01:16:00.286 --> 01:16:01.687
Stop touching me.

01:16:14.767 --> 01:16:16.936
There's evil in the walls,

01:16:19.905 --> 01:16:20.739
in the air.

01:16:23.943 --> 01:16:25.477
It feeds on this fear!

01:16:33.152 --> 01:16:35.454
I just wanna go home!

01:16:35.487 --> 01:16:37.456
And never come back again!

01:16:40.426 --> 01:16:43.963
I just, oh, wanna go home!

01:16:46.131 --> 01:16:49.368
Yeah, this is a very bad place.

01:16:49.401 --> 01:16:53.205
I hear whispering in my head.

01:16:55.307 --> 01:16:56.408
I hear voices.

01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:59.511
And it shall come.

01:17:00.512 --> 01:17:02.448
And it shall come.

01:17:03.816 --> 01:17:04.984
And it shall come.

01:17:09.922 --> 01:17:11.790
It is coming.

01:17:17.129 --> 01:17:20.766
I am back at the fucking
top of the stairs again!

01:17:25.571 --> 01:17:28.140
How is that possible?!

01:17:28.173 --> 01:17:29.475
None!

01:17:29.508 --> 01:17:32.544
None of this is
fucking possible!

01:17:36.248 --> 01:17:39.018
My
name is Thomas Livingston.

01:17:39.051 --> 01:17:42.488
I've been trapped inside
the Widow's Point Lighthouse

01:17:42.521 --> 01:17:44.556
for, what feels
like, an eternity.

01:17:45.591 --> 01:17:49.795
I know longer know if it's day
or night, or what day it is.

01:17:53.365 --> 01:17:56.468
Where is the sun?!

01:18:12.584 --> 01:18:14.553
I should be starving,

01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:18.490
but the lighthouse

01:18:26.098 --> 01:18:27.900
gives me rats to eat.

01:18:58.497 --> 01:19:00.199
And it shall come.

01:19:00.232 --> 01:19:01.467
And it shall come.

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.235
And it shall come.

01:19:03.268 --> 01:19:04.570
And it shall come.

01:19:04.603 --> 01:19:06.372
And it shall come.

01:19:06.405 --> 01:19:07.973
And it shall come.

01:19:08.006 --> 01:19:09.642
And it shall come.

01:19:09.676 --> 01:19:11.276
And it shall come.

01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:12.645
And it shall come.

01:19:12.679 --> 01:19:14.446
And it shall come.

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.281
And it shall come.

01:19:16.315 --> 01:19:17.149
Delaney.

01:19:18.651 --> 01:19:19.485
You're alive.

01:19:23.622 --> 01:19:24.923
I thought I killed you.

01:19:29.528 --> 01:19:30.362
Stevie.

01:19:35.601 --> 01:19:36.636
Abigail.

01:19:39.538 --> 01:19:40.372
Patrick.

01:19:44.309 --> 01:19:45.144
Monster.

01:19:47.246 --> 01:19:48.514
That makes two of us.

01:19:48.547 --> 01:19:50.182
You killed her too.

01:19:57.556 --> 01:19:59.558
Lydia.

01:19:59.591 --> 01:20:00.426
Lydia Pearl.

01:20:01.694 --> 01:20:03.429
And it shall come.

01:20:03.462 --> 01:20:05.164
And it shall come.

01:20:05.197 --> 01:20:06.699
And it shall come.

01:20:06.733 --> 01:20:08.967
- Rebecca Burch.
- And it shall come.

01:20:09.001 --> 01:20:10.569
And it shall come.

01:20:10.602 --> 01:20:12.171
And it shall come.

01:20:12.204 --> 01:20:13.640
And it shall come.

01:20:13.673 --> 01:20:15.040
And it shall come.

01:20:15.073 --> 01:20:17.042
- Am I...
- And it shall come.

01:20:17.075 --> 01:20:19.378
- And it shall come.
- To become one of you, then?

01:20:22.014 --> 01:20:23.650
Am I one of you?!

01:20:23.683 --> 01:20:25.217
And it shall come.

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:26.686
And it shall come.

01:20:26.719 --> 01:20:28.220
And it shall come.

01:20:28.253 --> 01:20:29.588
And it shall come.

01:20:29.621 --> 01:20:31.323
It is coming.

01:20:31.356 --> 01:20:32.624
No!

01:20:32.659 --> 01:20:33.492
What?!

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:36.595
What is coming?!

01:20:39.231 --> 01:20:41.600
What is coming, I have to know!

01:20:46.238 --> 01:20:47.707
The master.

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:49.508
The ancient one.

01:20:49.541 --> 01:20:52.745
It came here from another
dimension millennia ago,

01:20:52.779 --> 01:20:54.313
traveled the world by sea.

01:20:55.547 --> 01:20:59.652
The Kwakiutl tribe call
it Xa'niyus, devil fish.

01:20:59.686 --> 01:21:01.654
The Polynesians
called it Kanaloa,

01:21:03.288 --> 01:21:04.490
the god of the underworld.

01:21:04.523 --> 01:21:07.259
The Micronesians
called it Na Kika.

01:21:12.431 --> 01:21:13.733
And it shall come.

01:21:13.766 --> 01:21:15.534
And it shall come.

01:21:15.567 --> 01:21:17.302
And it shall come.

01:21:21.641 --> 01:21:23.375
What was that?

01:21:23.408 --> 01:21:26.578
Xa'niyus has been
trapped here for eons.

01:21:26.612 --> 01:21:28.614
It requires an enormous
amount of energy

01:21:28.648 --> 01:21:33.653
to return to its world, energy
derived from human souls.

01:21:34.821 --> 01:21:35.621
It sank the ships and
killed the sailors.

01:21:35.655 --> 01:21:37.489
It's been storing
the energy it needs

01:21:37.523 --> 01:21:39.224
here in the lighthouse.

01:21:39.258 --> 01:21:41.093
It's like one giant battery.

01:21:41.126 --> 01:21:42.762
Only when it
collects enough souls

01:21:42.795 --> 01:21:44.764
will it have the energy
it needs to leave.

01:21:44.797 --> 01:21:46.666
We are its servants.

01:21:46.699 --> 01:21:48.166
You'll serve it too.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.836
You'll stay here with us.

01:21:49.869 --> 01:21:51.603
Not on your lives.

01:21:51.638 --> 01:21:53.338
You don't have a choice.

01:21:53.372 --> 01:21:54.439
It's already here.

01:22:00.747 --> 01:22:05.718
Oh, my god.

01:22:06.318 --> 01:22:06.819
The hell?

01:22:08.821 --> 01:22:10.055
No.

01:22:19.766 --> 01:22:23.135
That thing will
never take me alive.

01:22:23.168 --> 01:22:26.405
Xa'niyus doesn't want you alive.

01:22:26.438 --> 01:22:27.573
What if I kill it?

01:22:28.808 --> 01:22:29.608
Will you all be freed?

01:22:29.642 --> 01:22:31.176
And it shall come.

01:22:31.844 --> 01:22:33.713
And it shall come.

01:22:33.746 --> 01:22:35.414
And it shall come.

01:22:35.447 --> 01:22:37.549
Xa'niyus can never be killed.

01:22:46.793 --> 01:22:48.695
We'll see about that.

01:23:55.795 --> 01:23:56.829
Oh, god.

01:24:01.801 --> 01:24:03.435
Turn that damn thing off.

01:24:09.274 --> 01:24:10.743
I'll go call the constable.

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.587
Oh, my lord.

01:24:22.621 --> 01:24:24.891
The police and EMTs just left.

01:24:24.924 --> 01:24:27.325
We need to do something
with Thomas's car.

01:24:27.359 --> 01:24:28.393
What I need to do is talk

01:24:28.427 --> 01:24:30.863
to our legal
department, right away.

01:24:30.897 --> 01:24:31.764
I warned you.

01:24:31.798 --> 01:24:33.900
Lawyers don't need to
know that, do they?

01:24:33.933 --> 01:24:35.668
Not necessarily.

01:24:35.702 --> 01:24:38.236
What did
you have in mind?

01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:41.007
Thomas had a great story here
at Widow's Point Lighthouse.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.542
Oh, one could argue it's
an even better story now.

01:24:43.575 --> 01:24:45.444
I wanna be the one to write it.

01:24:45.477 --> 01:24:46.846
Nonfiction?

01:24:46.879 --> 01:24:48.547
You want it to sell, don't you?

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:50.348
You'll have to write it fast
in order for it to be timely.

01:24:50.382 --> 01:24:51.550
Yeah, no problem.

01:24:52.584 --> 01:24:54.252
I have Thomas's research notes,

01:24:54.286 --> 01:24:57.556
but I'm gonna wanna
do some of my own too.

01:24:57.589 --> 01:24:59.759
What kind of advance
were you hoping for?

01:24:59.792 --> 01:25:01.661
We'll talk when I
get back to New York.

01:25:23.683 --> 01:25:28.020
Ghosts
around me and sing my name.

01:25:28.054 --> 01:25:31.256
Widow's Point Lighthouse
will never let me leave.

01:25:32.658 --> 01:25:35.427
