WEBVTT

00:02.741 --> 00:04.509
I need you to get here, Mark.

00:04.543 --> 00:05.877
I'll fly back as soon as I can.

00:05.911 --> 00:07.779
This story that my mom tells

00:07.813 --> 00:09.947
about my brother signing up after 9/11,

00:09.982 --> 00:12.116
it's not true. She made him enlist.

00:12.151 --> 00:14.352
Matt was doing drugs and selling drugs

00:14.386 --> 00:15.219
even back then.

00:15.254 --> 00:16.120
What's the matter?

00:16.155 --> 00:17.655
Her heart rate started racing.

00:17.690 --> 00:18.656
She's waking up.

00:18.691 --> 00:20.525
Tony, we're
inclined to discharge you,

00:20.559 --> 00:22.160
but you'll have to go to
family-counseling sessions

00:22.194 --> 00:23.294
with your father every week.

00:23.328 --> 00:24.696
<i>Go talk to the other punk.</i>

00:24.730 --> 00:25.930
<i>He's in gangs. He's in drugs. He's illegal.</i>

00:25.964 --> 00:28.299
<i>Those are the ones always
make the rest of us look bad.</i>

00:28.333 --> 00:30.201
A warrant's come
up for you in Mexico.

00:30.235 --> 00:31.536
They're gonna extradite you.

00:31.570 --> 00:32.737
You're leaving Los Cuetes?

00:32.771 --> 00:33.738
I'm done.

00:33.772 --> 00:34.906
Yeah, you done, bitch.

00:36.575 --> 00:39.077
You're gonna get counseling,
and you are going to engage

00:39.111 --> 00:39.977
your mother and your brother.

00:40.012 --> 00:42.680
I can't breathe with these people here.

00:42.715 --> 00:45.883
The proof of Mr. nix's
guilt is not as evident

00:45.918 --> 00:47.919
as when the court determined
bail was not appropriate.

00:47.953 --> 00:48.820
A $100,000 bond?

00:48.854 --> 00:50.755
If you're willing to accept our freedom,

00:50.789 --> 00:52.857
then you have to be willing
to accept what comes with it.

00:52.891 --> 00:54.559
And you need to stay away from that girl.

00:54.593 --> 00:56.928
Aubry... she's not what
you're saying she is.

00:56.962 --> 00:58.863
I love her.

01:58.524 --> 02:00.224
Uh...

02:00.259 --> 02:02.326
Russ, why don't you go back
into the car? I can do this.

02:02.361 --> 02:04.295
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

02:27.653 --> 02:29.120
Thank you.

03:18.370 --> 03:19.871
Your certificate of release

03:19.905 --> 03:22.874
binds you to the following obligations.

03:22.908 --> 03:26.010
Each of these obligations you
are required to adhere to,

03:26.044 --> 03:28.913
or the certificate will be voided.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.882
You shall not leave the geographic limits

03:30.916 --> 03:32.683
fixed by the certificate of release

03:32.718 --> 03:35.887
without written permission
of your supervision officer.

03:35.921 --> 03:37.054
Under no circumstances

03:37.089 --> 03:40.925
shall you tamper with, modify,
or remove your ankle unit.

03:40.959 --> 03:44.262
You shall not drink alcoholic
beverages to excess.

03:44.296 --> 03:48.733
You shall not purchase, possess,
sell, manufacture, use,

03:48.767 --> 03:51.502
or distribute any controlled substances.

03:51.536 --> 03:54.839
You shall not violate any law,
nor shall you associate

03:54.873 --> 03:57.575
with persons engaged in criminal activity.

03:57.609 --> 04:00.845
Do you understand and do you
agree to these stipulations?

04:00.879 --> 04:02.346
Yes.

04:12.958 --> 04:14.659
Do you want to eat?

04:16.995 --> 04:19.563
When was the last time
you had some good food?

04:22.501 --> 04:24.435
I could go for some ribs.

04:24.469 --> 04:25.903
I'm not buying pork.

04:25.938 --> 04:28.472
If you want some barbecue,
I'll get you some chicken,

04:28.507 --> 04:30.942
but I'm not doing pork.

04:57.769 --> 04:59.303
So, when we get home,

04:59.338 --> 05:01.772
you and me, we'll change, and
then we'll go by the garage.

05:01.807 --> 05:02.807
For what?

05:02.841 --> 05:04.108
It's a surprise.

05:04.142 --> 05:05.509
For what?

05:05.544 --> 05:07.278
Not for anything. It's just a surprise.

05:07.312 --> 05:09.013
Well, what's the surprise?

05:09.047 --> 05:10.481
We'll get to the garage,
and then you'll see.

05:10.515 --> 05:12.183
Can't you just tell him what it is?

05:12.217 --> 05:13.184
Please?

05:13.218 --> 05:15.419
I got the car back.

05:15.454 --> 05:17.855
I got the car back from the police.

05:17.889 --> 05:18.956
I-it needs a lot of work,

05:18.991 --> 05:21.092
but whatever they broke,
you and me, we can fix it.

05:21.126 --> 05:22.693
Why would I want to work on that car?!

05:22.728 --> 05:24.028
Mijo, we always work on that car.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.529
The one I got arrested in?!

05:25.564 --> 05:27.498
Why would I want to see that again?!

05:27.532 --> 05:30.968
God, you're stupid, you know?!

05:40.679 --> 05:42.179
Who's paying for this?

05:42.214 --> 05:45.483
You are.

05:45.517 --> 05:47.018
Tomorrow, you'll rest,

05:47.052 --> 05:49.153
and then Wednesday you'll
start working at the Masjid.

05:49.187 --> 05:50.354
Doing what?

05:50.389 --> 05:52.123
You'll help out with the accounting.

05:52.157 --> 05:53.224
I ain't doing that crap.

05:53.258 --> 05:55.126
Don't use that type of language.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.194
- What the hell?
- Carter...

05:57.229 --> 05:58.362
- Look, I'm paying for this place...
- Carter...

05:58.397 --> 05:59.630
I can talk how I want.

05:59.664 --> 06:01.665
Here. Take this.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.601
It's not about you.

06:04.703 --> 06:07.171
The apartment, the bond money...

06:07.205 --> 06:09.974
That's a whole lot from
a whole lot of people.

06:10.008 --> 06:11.809
They look at you and they see themselves...

06:11.843 --> 06:16.380
A good man, bad mistakes, second chances.

06:16.415 --> 06:20.484
I mean, m-maybe... Maybe they're
giving you what they never got.

06:21.753 --> 06:24.188
I ain't carrying them on my back.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.992
You're not carrying them.

06:28.026 --> 06:29.393
They're carrying you.

06:32.230 --> 06:33.998
Tomorrow, you'll rest,

06:34.032 --> 06:37.068
and then Wednesday, I'll be back at 9:00.

06:37.102 --> 06:38.836
Please be ready.

06:40.439 --> 06:41.839
Doreen.

06:43.108 --> 06:44.108
That's not my name.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.409
Look, come on.

06:46.278 --> 06:48.279
You're my sister.

06:48.313 --> 06:50.347
Doreen is my sister.

06:54.886 --> 06:58.923
I could use family to talk to right now.

06:58.957 --> 07:00.257
Family.

07:02.627 --> 07:05.362
Not somebody who got herself a new name.

07:09.267 --> 07:12.036
It's not just a new name.

07:16.341 --> 07:19.610
I'll be back Wednesday at 9:00.

07:44.241 --> 07:45.341
You look good.

07:45.376 --> 07:46.509
You look healthy.

07:46.543 --> 07:49.312
- Hmm. Eight days sober.
- Oh.

07:49.346 --> 07:53.182
I keep telling Ruth and
Brian how well you're doing.

07:53.217 --> 07:54.684
They'd like to see for themselves.

07:54.718 --> 07:55.985
They'd like to take you out tonight.

07:57.054 --> 07:58.788
I'm not going out with them.
They're not my family.

07:58.822 --> 08:00.223
You know what? Stop it.

08:00.257 --> 08:02.358
We're all your family.

08:02.393 --> 08:03.893
Tolerate me, why can't you put up with them?

08:03.927 --> 08:06.296
That woman...

08:06.330 --> 08:08.398
And Brian's a dope. He's an idiot.

08:08.432 --> 08:10.300
They are staying up here for you.

08:10.334 --> 08:12.135
They just want to support you.

08:12.169 --> 08:15.371
And I am doing all this for you,
so please don't spoil my mood.

08:15.406 --> 08:18.975
It's hard enough to not
want to funnel some Tequila

08:19.009 --> 08:20.476
without having them around.

08:26.116 --> 08:29.052
Is it okay if I borrow your car?

08:29.086 --> 08:30.186
I have to get to my N.A. meeting,

08:30.220 --> 08:35.058
and that crowd on the bus is
not conducive to sobriety.

08:35.092 --> 08:38.061
And I'd like to shop for some clothes.

08:38.095 --> 08:39.828
New attitude, new clothes.

08:41.597 --> 08:43.299
Maybe I'll rent you a car.

08:44.368 --> 08:45.568
Rent?

08:45.602 --> 08:48.705
Well, you're gonna be stuck
up here another five months...

08:48.739 --> 08:51.708
- Six months.
- Six months doing this probation.

08:51.742 --> 08:54.177
Might as well have a little independence.

08:54.211 --> 08:56.346
New attitude, new car.

08:57.781 --> 08:59.882
Okay. Stop it.

08:59.917 --> 09:02.585
Come on.

09:02.619 --> 09:04.454
Eh, you're as bad as me.

09:06.123 --> 09:08.057
Not that bad.

09:36.687 --> 09:38.654
In exchange for any
additional information,

09:38.689 --> 09:40.256
we'd be willing to contact

09:40.290 --> 09:43.326
the magistrate in Sinaloa on your behalf

09:43.360 --> 09:45.228
and tell them you were
a cooperative witness.

09:45.262 --> 09:47.130
What does that do?

09:47.164 --> 09:48.431
That don't do nothing.

09:48.465 --> 09:50.099
We'd request leniency.

09:50.134 --> 09:52.068
You think they care?

09:52.102 --> 09:54.404
The only thing you really have
right now is Hector's testimony.

09:54.438 --> 09:56.806
He's got more to say, but
he's not saying anything

09:56.840 --> 09:58.408
if you're sending him back to Mexico.

09:58.442 --> 09:59.942
That's not us. Deportation's federal.

09:59.977 --> 10:01.444
It's not deportation.

10:01.478 --> 10:03.513
It's extradition.

10:03.547 --> 10:05.648
And if I'm facing charges here,

10:05.682 --> 10:07.917
then you don't have to send me anywhere.

10:07.951 --> 10:11.454
I'm not dumb. Don't act like I am.

10:11.488 --> 10:12.488
Why you here?

10:14.525 --> 10:18.161
- W-why am I...
- You sitting there

10:18.195 --> 10:19.829
'cause you don't got... else on this Carter

10:19.863 --> 10:21.597
except what I tell you.

10:21.632 --> 10:24.434
You didn't give a damn about me before,

10:24.468 --> 10:26.969
but you're gonna give a damn now.

10:27.004 --> 10:28.604
So, you need to dial up somebody.

10:28.639 --> 10:30.506
You need to talk to who in the hell ever,

10:30.541 --> 10:31.474
and you need to come back

10:31.508 --> 10:33.743
and you need to show me something for real!

10:37.581 --> 10:41.317
I don't do nothing for free.

10:41.351 --> 10:42.685
Nothing.

11:19.957 --> 11:21.824
Was I like this?

11:23.560 --> 11:24.527
How do you not remember?

11:25.796 --> 11:29.065
You're like a girl. Only girls
remember that kind of stuff.

11:30.968 --> 11:33.569
You were the other way.

11:35.639 --> 11:39.775
You were standing there, looking over at me

11:39.810 --> 11:41.911
with a beer in your hand.

11:43.714 --> 11:45.615
And?

11:45.649 --> 11:47.450
What did you think?

11:47.484 --> 11:52.722
You saw me, and what did you think?

12:23.153 --> 12:27.523
♪ She'll tear you down
and build you up ♪

12:29.426 --> 12:33.596
♪ She'll haunt your bed
and take your love ♪

12:40.170 --> 12:43.639
It's a satellite thing.

12:43.674 --> 12:46.676
That's a data-pushing one-piece GPS.

12:46.710 --> 12:48.110
If you go outside the city limits,

12:48.145 --> 12:49.812
it sends an e-mail to your bail officer.

12:49.846 --> 12:51.647
It's all on the Internet.

12:51.682 --> 12:54.684
Come on. Careful with that.

12:54.718 --> 12:56.953
My dad actually thinks I'm sober.

12:56.987 --> 12:59.355
He's such a dope.

12:59.389 --> 13:01.591
I keep telling him to get Ruth
and Brian out of my hair,

13:01.625 --> 13:04.260
but he won't do it.

13:04.294 --> 13:05.695
Families, man.

13:05.729 --> 13:07.997
How's princess Leia?

13:08.031 --> 13:09.365
Aliyah.

13:09.399 --> 13:11.100
Princess Aliyah.

13:11.134 --> 13:13.936
Black maleficent.

13:13.971 --> 13:17.673
Racist bitch, her and her whole group.

13:17.708 --> 13:19.008
At least she cares about you.

13:19.042 --> 13:20.643
She doesn't care about me.

13:20.677 --> 13:21.677
All she cares about

13:21.712 --> 13:24.880
is saving her brother from
some evil white na na,

13:24.915 --> 13:27.183
and any brother will do.

13:27.217 --> 13:30.019
You think she can do it?
You think she can get you off?

13:30.053 --> 13:32.021
Everybody in this city better hope so,

13:32.055 --> 13:34.056
or she'll take her
flamethrower to this joint.

13:34.091 --> 13:35.658
I'm serious.

13:35.692 --> 13:36.859
You think she can save you?

13:36.893 --> 13:38.628
Save me from what?

13:38.662 --> 13:40.162
There ain't nothing to save me from.

13:40.197 --> 13:42.164
They want to kill you.

13:42.199 --> 13:44.300
They're ready to kill you.

13:45.535 --> 13:47.637
You see how I'm out.

13:47.671 --> 13:50.973
You see how all this is
falling apart on them.

13:51.008 --> 13:53.509
That's 'cause they got nothing.

13:53.543 --> 13:55.845
They're not gonna kill me.

13:57.347 --> 13:59.182
When's the princess coming back?

13:59.216 --> 14:00.983
Wednesday.

14:01.018 --> 14:02.919
So, we've got a day.

14:06.723 --> 14:10.226
We've got a day.

14:45.230 --> 14:46.831
Mark.

14:48.867 --> 14:50.535
Mark.

14:50.569 --> 14:52.337
Come on.

14:58.844 --> 15:04.682
It's just painful, to
bury your brother in Oakland,

15:04.717 --> 15:07.552
the last place he'd ever want to be.

15:07.586 --> 15:08.820
It's for Gwen.

15:08.854 --> 15:10.521
What does she care?

15:10.556 --> 15:13.858
She was off running around, sleeping around.

15:13.892 --> 15:18.162
Tom and Eve, after all that,
they can't even show up.

15:18.197 --> 15:19.430
They want a separate service.

15:19.465 --> 15:21.232
Well, they're going through a lot.

15:23.369 --> 15:25.670
<i>I'm</i> going through a lot.

15:25.704 --> 15:29.607
This... whole thing, my God.

15:44.089 --> 15:46.991
You think this family's
ever gonna be normal?

15:48.894 --> 15:53.431
This family was never normal, not once.

15:53.466 --> 15:56.334
It's just you and me now.

15:56.368 --> 15:58.336
That's it.

16:12.218 --> 16:13.284
Luis?

16:13.319 --> 16:14.786
Who's this?

16:14.820 --> 16:15.553
I'm friends with Edgar.

16:15.588 --> 16:16.321
Friend who?

16:16.355 --> 16:17.789
Tony. I was in juvie with Edgar.

16:17.823 --> 16:21.392
Yeah? So what? He gave me your
number, and he said I should reach out.

16:21.427 --> 16:23.595
He said...

16:23.629 --> 16:25.430
He said you're kind of a
punk and owe him money.

16:27.566 --> 16:29.033
Yeah, you know Edgar.

16:29.068 --> 16:30.068
Here's what's up...

16:30.102 --> 16:32.237
Uh, text me where you're
at and I'll roll through.

16:32.271 --> 16:33.938
Hey, you Tony?

16:33.973 --> 16:35.607
Yeah. That's for Edgar.

16:35.641 --> 16:37.742
Tell him I put a little sweetness
on top so he can shut up.

16:39.645 --> 16:40.945
He good to you in juvie?

16:40.980 --> 16:42.780
Yeah, he did some good looking out.

16:42.815 --> 16:44.215
I don't get to see him.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.984
It's just depressing.

16:46.018 --> 16:48.152
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

16:48.187 --> 16:50.822
Why don't you come hang some?
Tell me what's up with my cuz.

16:50.856 --> 16:52.924
Come on, man. It ain't
like you got... to do.

16:52.958 --> 16:54.158
Let's hit it.

16:54.193 --> 16:55.460
- All right.
- All right. Let's go.

17:14.713 --> 17:16.814
Mm.

17:22.121 --> 17:24.656
- What did you do?
- Relax.

17:24.690 --> 17:27.759
- What the hell did you do?
- I cut you loose.

17:27.792 --> 17:29.594
You stupid? They're gonna come get me!

17:29.628 --> 17:31.329
No, they're not.

17:31.364 --> 17:33.537
- They're gonna stick me back inside!
- It's been an hour and a half,

17:33.537 --> 17:34.714
and nobody's coming.

17:34.714 --> 17:35.633
An hour?

17:35.668 --> 17:37.502
It only goes off if you go outside the city.

17:37.536 --> 17:39.337
When they come find me,
and I don't have this on...

17:39.372 --> 17:43.174
They'll find you if you're
here when they come looking.

17:43.209 --> 17:44.376
I've got a rental car.

17:44.410 --> 17:47.278
It's about a thousand miles from
here to the Canadian border.

17:47.313 --> 17:48.847
- We get to Vancouver...
- What?

17:48.881 --> 17:50.682
More Vietnamese transports dock in Vancouver

17:50.716 --> 17:52.650
than any other port in
the Pacific Northwest.

17:52.685 --> 17:55.120
We get a coyote to
smuggle us back to Vietnam.

17:55.154 --> 17:57.355
They have no extradition
agreement with the U.S.

17:57.390 --> 17:59.124
What... What the hell?

17:59.158 --> 18:00.658
The two months you were in prison,

18:00.693 --> 18:01.960
I have been thinking about this.

18:01.994 --> 18:04.963
- I have been thinking about this.
- It's crazy. It's insane!

18:04.997 --> 18:07.499
You getting executed for
something you didn't do...

18:07.533 --> 18:09.134
<i>That's</i> crazy.

18:09.168 --> 18:10.535
That's insane.

18:10.569 --> 18:12.437
And I'm trapped here watching it happen.

18:12.471 --> 18:14.973
I can't be like this. I can't.

18:15.007 --> 18:16.107
I want...

18:17.176 --> 18:18.443
Look at them.

18:20.146 --> 18:21.680
Okay?

18:21.714 --> 18:23.982
Look at how happy they are.

18:24.016 --> 18:25.350
They're not real.

18:25.384 --> 18:26.484
They are.

18:26.519 --> 18:28.353
Those are real people.

18:28.387 --> 18:30.822
They are somewhere, they are
happy, and they're in love.

18:30.856 --> 18:32.357
You're high.

18:34.126 --> 18:37.362
I am that close to being
sober, and I hate how it feels,

18:37.396 --> 18:41.199
but when I think about you
and I think on how I met you,

18:41.234 --> 18:43.835
it's the only thing that makes me feel good.

18:45.504 --> 18:48.173
I'm gonna do what I have
to to keep you alive.

18:50.910 --> 18:54.446
So, are you coming, or are you staying?

19:20.977 --> 19:22.177
You okay?

19:22.211 --> 19:24.746
Hmm? What's that?

19:24.781 --> 19:27.582
Are you all right? You seem kind of...

19:27.617 --> 19:28.583
Yeah, yeah.

19:28.618 --> 19:34.756
I, uh, I just, uh, I had
a... not my best week.

19:34.791 --> 19:36.958
Nothing you want to talk about?

19:36.993 --> 19:38.126
Well, you seem pretty happy.

19:38.161 --> 19:40.762
- No reason to ruin that with my...
- Ruin it?

19:40.797 --> 19:41.696
With my problems.

19:41.731 --> 19:45.233
I bet my drama can beat your drama any day.

19:45.268 --> 19:46.902
I don't bet.

19:48.404 --> 19:51.239
Well, happy to share drama
for free sometime, then.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.240
Okay?

19:54.444 --> 19:57.379
Yeah, that's very okay.

19:57.414 --> 19:58.814
Thank you.

20:37.086 --> 20:38.187
Thank you.

20:38.221 --> 20:41.023
Yeah. Of course.

20:42.292 --> 20:46.695
Edgar, man, he's a trip.

20:46.729 --> 20:48.630
That's his third time in juvie?

20:48.665 --> 20:50.599
Third time. He talks about how I'm lazy?

20:50.633 --> 20:52.267
He's cool.

20:52.302 --> 20:54.136
Yeah, he's cool. I love him.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.904
It's just, he's just ignorant.

20:55.939 --> 20:57.639
Been nuts since I been out, you know?

20:57.674 --> 21:00.576
I got people looking at me,
people in church looking at me.

21:00.610 --> 21:02.277
My papi acts like nothing happened,

21:02.312 --> 21:04.613
like he wasn't the one who
got me in trouble first off.

21:04.647 --> 21:07.883
Why do you care what people think, dog? Huh?

21:07.917 --> 21:10.619
You survived that nonsense, que no?

21:10.653 --> 21:13.455
I was 10 the first time I went into juvie.

21:13.490 --> 21:15.657
I haven't been back inside since.

21:15.692 --> 21:16.959
Straighten you out?

21:16.993 --> 21:18.560
Just can't be obvious about it,

21:18.595 --> 21:19.628
you know what I'm saying?

21:19.662 --> 21:20.996
Look, you do what you got to do,

21:21.030 --> 21:22.431
but you can't be obvious about it.

21:22.465 --> 21:24.566
Don't be hanging out
with gangs or being loud.

21:24.601 --> 21:26.602
Like me, I got me a 9-to-5,

21:26.636 --> 21:28.337
but don't get it twisted, dog.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.305
I still do my thing on the side, homie.

21:30.340 --> 21:31.139
What kind of things?

21:31.174 --> 21:32.074
Ah, look at you.

21:32.108 --> 21:33.575
You want a piece of my action now or what?

21:33.610 --> 21:34.676
- Nah.
- Huh?

21:34.711 --> 21:37.779
Hey, dude, fool, it's all good.

21:37.814 --> 21:40.682
If you get in this game, you
got to be smart from the jump.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.184
You hear what I'm saying?

21:42.218 --> 21:44.486
Around cops, you keep your mouth shut.

21:44.521 --> 21:47.155
And if your pops don't know
that, you got to know it.

21:47.190 --> 21:48.857
You don't depend on nobody.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.826
You depend on yourself and that's it.

21:50.860 --> 21:51.793
It's all good, dog.

21:51.828 --> 21:54.696
You just got your cherry popped, that's all.

21:54.731 --> 21:55.597
Hey, you're good with Edgar,

21:55.632 --> 21:57.099
which means you're good with me, dog.

21:57.133 --> 21:58.200
I got your back, all right?

21:58.234 --> 21:59.968
Good.

22:00.003 --> 22:01.837
Eat up.

22:03.640 --> 22:06.341
Am I gonna have trouble getting into Canada?

22:06.376 --> 22:08.810
All you need is a driver's license.

22:08.845 --> 22:10.646
I think you need a passport.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.114
Just a license.

22:12.148 --> 22:14.650
A license was back in the day.

22:14.684 --> 22:17.553
You need a passport now.

22:17.587 --> 22:20.689
So, we get to Canada,
where we find this coyote?

22:20.723 --> 22:22.558
At the docks.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.493
Some guy you know, or are
we just finding somebody?

22:24.527 --> 22:25.861
Oh, we'll find somebody at the docks.

22:25.895 --> 22:27.062
It's where they hang out.

22:27.096 --> 22:28.597
Hey, give me a beer.

22:29.666 --> 22:32.067
I think we're out.

22:32.101 --> 22:35.537
- We find this guy, and then how we gonna...
- Yes, I said we'll find somebody.

22:35.572 --> 22:37.239
We find him.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.474
How we gonna get him to
smuggle us to Vietnam?

22:39.509 --> 22:40.576
We'll pay him.

22:40.610 --> 22:43.211
The whole time you were in
jail, I thought about it.

22:43.246 --> 22:45.647
Just run with me, okay?

22:45.682 --> 22:49.251
Gosh, you stress me out.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.687
I got to get a beer.

22:56.359 --> 22:58.527
It's a middle ground, Alonzo.

22:58.561 --> 23:00.929
For us, it's about being
compassionate in all respects.

23:00.964 --> 23:03.065
- By kicking us out of the church?
- That's not what we're doing.

23:03.099 --> 23:04.340
We're not asking you to leave.
- Tony and Jenny,

23:04.340 --> 23:05.548
they were both baptized there.

23:05.548 --> 23:07.669
You had services for Roberta there.

23:07.704 --> 23:10.172
We have to be mindful of
the whole congregation.

23:10.206 --> 23:11.607
We're a sanctuary church.

23:11.641 --> 23:12.708
We made a commitment to protect

23:12.742 --> 23:15.010
the very same people you're
debasing on television.

23:15.044 --> 23:17.346
I'm not... I'm not...
All I said is what happened,

23:17.380 --> 23:20.515
- and the illegal got Tony in trouble.
- A young man.

23:20.550 --> 23:22.718
A young man got Tony in trouble.

23:22.752 --> 23:24.886
His status doesn't have
any more to do with it

23:24.921 --> 23:26.788
than his race or his faith.

23:26.823 --> 23:27.789
No. No.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.758
He broke the law when
he came to this country.

23:29.792 --> 23:30.726
He did.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.295
And there are a whole lot of us who didn't.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.597
But you want to give him
a seat in the front row,

23:35.632 --> 23:37.432
and the rest of us can just go to hell.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.902
Your family's always welcome.

23:40.937 --> 23:41.903
Always.

23:41.938 --> 23:43.538
But for everyone's comfort,

23:43.573 --> 23:46.742
we ask that you do your best
to avoid the Sunday mass.

23:46.776 --> 23:50.312
There's plenty of room in
the Saturday-night mass.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.381
Saturday night.

23:52.415 --> 23:55.384
This isn't an excommunication.

23:55.418 --> 23:57.152
They tagged my shop,

23:57.186 --> 23:58.720
they called me names,

23:58.755 --> 24:03.925
and you care more about them
than you do about my family.

24:03.960 --> 24:07.796
If you ever want to
reconcile with the church,

24:07.830 --> 24:10.732
I'd be more than willing to help.

24:27.316 --> 24:28.517
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:28.551 --> 24:29.785
Can we talk?

24:32.121 --> 24:33.455
Mm-hmm.

24:41.898 --> 24:44.633
Uh, so, um...

24:46.436 --> 24:50.139
I got some news, I guess.

24:50.173 --> 24:52.207
I'm getting married.

24:53.576 --> 24:56.845
You guess?

24:56.880 --> 25:00.582
That's... well, that's wonderful news!

25:00.617 --> 25:02.651
Uh, where did you meet her?

25:02.685 --> 25:04.686
In Germany. She's got rank on me.

25:04.721 --> 25:05.587
She's your boss?

25:05.622 --> 25:07.022
Yeah, sort of.

25:07.056 --> 25:08.524
You have to follow her orders?

25:08.558 --> 25:10.225
I love her.

25:10.260 --> 25:11.860
When can I meet her? What's her name?

25:11.895 --> 25:13.429
Well, she wanted to come to the funeral,

25:13.463 --> 25:14.696
but she couldn't get leave.

25:14.731 --> 25:15.798
You have a picture of her?

25:17.600 --> 25:19.535
Uh...

25:19.569 --> 25:20.602
Mark, is she pregnant?

25:20.637 --> 25:22.538
No... No, she's not pregnant.

25:22.572 --> 25:25.207
Well, I don't know. It's just so fast.

25:25.241 --> 25:26.809
It's not that fast, really.

25:28.978 --> 25:32.047
I've been dating her for a year now.

25:32.081 --> 25:34.883
And you're just telling me?

25:34.918 --> 25:37.019
I didn't know how you'd take it.

25:37.053 --> 25:39.788
I'm happy for you. Why wouldn't I be?

25:39.823 --> 25:43.225
Why wouldn't I be happy for you?

25:43.259 --> 25:45.794
Mom, she's a woman of color.

25:45.829 --> 25:48.464
What does that mean, color? She's black?

25:48.498 --> 25:49.932
- No.
- Then what is she?

25:49.966 --> 25:51.633
Why do you need to know so badly?

25:51.668 --> 25:53.602
I don't need to know. You're
the one that's not telling me.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.971
Why are you... why are you
making such a big deal out of this?

25:56.005 --> 25:58.207
Because well, I-I know how you were

25:58.241 --> 25:59.942
when Matt and I were growing up,

25:59.976 --> 26:01.543
I see what you're doing
here in Modesto, and...

26:01.578 --> 26:03.612
What am I doing here in Modesto

26:03.646 --> 26:05.414
except trying to make things
right for your brother?

26:05.448 --> 26:06.415
How?

26:06.449 --> 26:09.485
By going on and on about
blacks and illegals?

26:09.519 --> 26:10.752
They killed your brother.

26:10.787 --> 26:14.256
No, some ass... killed my brother, mom.

26:14.290 --> 26:16.124
But before any of this happened,

26:16.159 --> 26:17.793
it was the same kind of talk from you,

26:17.827 --> 26:21.096
the same talk about black
people, about "those" people.

26:21.130 --> 26:23.332
I never said anything. You're the one...

26:23.366 --> 26:24.516
- You're the one that's making
- No... no, you don't know

26:24.516 --> 26:26.629
- the issue out of your girlfriend.
- how that messed me and Matt up.

26:26.629 --> 26:29.438
And then you dump Matt in the army

26:29.472 --> 26:31.139
because you think that's gonna help him?

26:31.174 --> 26:33.475
The army isn't family counseling, mom.

26:33.510 --> 26:34.510
And if you start off bad,

26:34.544 --> 26:36.645
there's a whole different
place you can go to.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.747
But not you? You're
better than your brother?

26:38.781 --> 26:40.816
I'm luckier. I woke up in my head.

26:40.850 --> 26:43.785
I looked around. I saw people
around me that had my back...

26:43.820 --> 26:47.589
- Black people, white people, people of color.
- You sound like you're...

26:47.624 --> 26:51.793
You sound like you're under the
influence. You really do.

26:51.828 --> 26:54.530
Did... did your... did your girlfriend
give you a little study guide

26:54.564 --> 26:56.627
- on what to say to your mother?
- Okay, Russ... Russ

26:56.627 --> 26:58.645
suing you over Matt's body,

26:58.645 --> 27:02.104
you still pretending that Matt
was some kind of a war hero,

27:02.138 --> 27:07.009
and Gwen sleeping around because
Matt was so messed up on drugs!

27:07.043 --> 27:10.712
I asked you if you thought
we would ever be normal,

27:10.747 --> 27:12.781
and you said no.

27:15.885 --> 27:19.021
So, how am I supposed to drop
my fiancée into all this?

27:31.234 --> 27:32.568
What's her name?

27:32.602 --> 27:34.036
Richelle.

27:36.706 --> 27:39.041
Is she coming up here?

27:39.075 --> 27:40.576
When her furlough comes through,

27:40.610 --> 27:43.145
yes, she'll be staying with me for a while.

27:46.883 --> 27:48.717
Can I meet her?

27:57.894 --> 28:00.996
It was so hard for me when
you and Matt were growing up.

28:01.030 --> 28:03.632
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know it was hard, mom.

28:05.468 --> 28:10.772
But I can't do anything
about how things were.

28:10.807 --> 28:13.675
I can only deal with how things are now.

28:26.094 --> 28:28.996
I-5 north, straight shot. See?

28:29.030 --> 28:31.365
We should just go to Seattle.

28:31.399 --> 28:34.168
Seattle? Only good thing
out of Seattle was Hendrix.

28:34.202 --> 28:36.503
It's the same thing as going to Vancouver,

28:36.538 --> 28:38.205
but we don't have to hassle with the border.

28:38.239 --> 28:39.907
How do we get a boat in Seattle?

28:39.941 --> 28:41.408
How do we get a boat in Vancouver?

28:41.443 --> 28:43.677
Two months I've been thinking about this.

28:43.712 --> 28:45.245
Two months.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.015
Were you drinking while you were thinking?

28:48.049 --> 28:51.685
You need to be drinking.

28:51.720 --> 28:55.189
I want to be with you.

28:55.223 --> 28:57.691
Like the first time, okay?

28:57.726 --> 29:00.694
Like when we first met.

29:21.850 --> 29:23.784
Jenny, what's up, mama?

29:24.753 --> 29:26.954
- I don't get a "hello"?
- No.

29:26.989 --> 29:27.989
What's up with your brother?

29:28.023 --> 29:30.958
- Heard they let that little freak out.
- Shut up.

29:30.993 --> 29:33.828
- Boy's a little juvie punk.
- You better watch your mouth.

29:33.862 --> 29:36.163
Heard he pounded some
girl with his little pee-pee.

29:36.198 --> 29:38.566
That's what happened? Pounded her?

29:38.600 --> 29:40.668
And some black dude shot her in the head?

29:40.702 --> 29:43.671
Your brother's cold gangsta.

29:43.705 --> 29:44.972
Bitch, are you crazy?!

29:45.007 --> 29:46.507
Ow! Are you crazy, bitch?!

29:46.541 --> 29:48.175
Hey! Hey! Cut it out! Let her go!

29:48.210 --> 29:49.910
Leave her!

30:03.125 --> 30:05.192
Don't drink and drive.

30:08.964 --> 30:10.197
Don't!

30:10.232 --> 30:13.501
You told me not to drink and drive.

30:13.535 --> 30:16.237
Quit messing around.

30:16.271 --> 30:20.441
I'm not getting sent back
inside for some nonsense...

30:20.475 --> 30:24.178
Drinking and driving, littering.

30:26.415 --> 30:28.182
How long have we been on the road?

30:28.216 --> 30:30.551
Maybe 40 minutes.

30:30.585 --> 30:34.088
No way. It's been a couple hours.

30:34.122 --> 30:37.525
We stopped, we got beer,
had us a little picnic.

30:37.559 --> 30:39.593
Feels like hours.

30:39.628 --> 30:42.463
We should do some drugs.

30:42.497 --> 30:45.232
You have any drugs?

30:45.267 --> 30:47.068
How the hell am I gonna have drugs?

30:47.102 --> 30:50.237
We could get some.
We'll get some in Seattle.

30:50.272 --> 30:54.241
- We're not going to Seattle! We're going...
- we'll get some wherever.

30:56.445 --> 30:59.647
We don't know anybody in Canada.
We should go back to Modesto.

30:59.681 --> 31:01.292
- What?
- Get some money from my dad.

31:01.292 --> 31:02.135
He'd give me money.

31:02.135 --> 31:04.014
- We're not going back to Modesto.
- Get us, like, an orgy of drugs,

31:04.014 --> 31:05.489
have us one massive smackfest,

31:05.489 --> 31:07.054
- and then we go back.
- They're looking for me in Modesto.

31:07.289 --> 31:08.622
But not yet!

31:08.657 --> 31:11.292
We're not going back to score some...

31:11.326 --> 31:14.528
Okay, we get to where we're
going, and I'll hook you up.

31:23.939 --> 31:26.574
Same as always.

31:26.608 --> 31:28.375
I swear.

31:30.846 --> 31:33.414
I'll take care of you.

31:35.650 --> 31:38.219
But we got to get back to where we're going.

31:41.723 --> 31:43.724
Okay.

31:53.318 --> 31:55.559
- We can't go back. We're not going back.
- Why are you being like this?

31:55.559 --> 31:57.579
- We've got people chasing us!
- Why won't you let me have a hit?

31:57.579 --> 31:58.690
- We get to where we're going,
- I just hit a couple!

31:58.690 --> 31:59.920
- then you can get lit up!
- Why won't you let me have this?

31:59.920 --> 32:01.130
- People are chasing us!
- Just need a couple!

32:01.130 --> 32:03.574
- You hate me! Why do you hate...
- I don't hate you, but we're not...

32:03.574 --> 32:06.560
- Why won't you let me have one?!
- Get to where we're going, then you can get...

32:06.560 --> 32:08.410
- You're an ass!
- We're not going back!

33:22.785 --> 33:26.221
Ow.

34:02.291 --> 34:05.693
I'm gonna get some money from my dad,

34:05.728 --> 34:08.763
get some drugs.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.632
It's all good.

34:37.525 --> 34:39.293
Michael.

34:41.063 --> 34:42.697
Michael.

34:42.731 --> 34:44.465
Mi... Hey.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.302
Where's Michael? He's with mom.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.870
When's he coming back?

34:48.904 --> 34:50.204
I don't know. Probably not long.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.806
I'm just hanging out.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.641
They'll be back.

34:53.676 --> 34:55.409
Can I get you, like a-a coke or something?

34:55.444 --> 34:56.077
No.

34:56.110 --> 34:56.978
- How's everything?
- Good.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.314
How's, uh, your meetings and everything?

34:59.348 --> 35:00.214
Okay.

35:00.249 --> 35:02.250
That's great. We're all real proud of you.

35:02.284 --> 35:05.920
I know it's not easy what you're
going through, but it's great...

35:05.955 --> 35:07.822
Don't you have a job or something?

35:07.856 --> 35:09.657
You've been here for like two months.

35:09.692 --> 35:10.692
Don't you have a job?

35:10.726 --> 35:12.827
I'm back at school.

35:12.861 --> 35:16.731
I'm getting my master's. I told you that.

35:16.765 --> 35:20.034
I took this semester off to be here.

35:20.069 --> 35:21.102
You okay?

35:21.136 --> 35:22.403
When's Michael coming back?

35:22.438 --> 35:25.940
- Do you want me to call him?
- No.

35:25.975 --> 35:28.776
I just need to borrow some money.

35:28.811 --> 35:30.878
I can lend you some money.

35:30.913 --> 35:32.080
How much?

35:32.114 --> 35:34.849
Oh, like, uh...$500.

35:35.818 --> 35:37.952
- $500?
- Mm- hmm.

35:37.987 --> 35:40.288
It's for a dress.

35:40.322 --> 35:42.557
He wants me to look pretty.

35:42.591 --> 35:44.559
I don't have $500.

35:44.593 --> 35:46.761
How much you got?

35:59.008 --> 36:01.476
$85... $87.

36:01.510 --> 36:05.446
I can make myself
look good for $87.

36:07.850 --> 36:12.887
Everybody really wants you
to clean up and come home.

36:56.965 --> 37:00.168
Aubry, what's up, girl? Where you been?

37:00.202 --> 37:02.603
It's been crazy. Crazy
like you wouldn't know.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.038
Yeah? What's up, Carter?

37:04.073 --> 37:04.772
Hey.

37:04.807 --> 37:06.274
So, look, we need a hook-up.

37:06.308 --> 37:08.042
We got cash. We're not messing around.

37:08.077 --> 37:09.477
We're looking to get lit up.

37:09.511 --> 37:11.145
Yeah, for sure.

37:11.180 --> 37:12.146
Yo, dog!

37:12.181 --> 37:16.050
Hey, come in here, man. We fixin' to party.

37:16.085 --> 37:17.351
Yeah.

37:17.386 --> 37:19.520
So, what y'all looking for?

37:19.555 --> 37:22.156
Y'all want to get up?
You want to chill? What?

37:22.191 --> 37:25.793
Nah, man. Just looking
to do business and go, man.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.995
I'm good. Cool.

37:28.030 --> 37:31.499
What's up with your boy?
Why you so grim?

37:31.533 --> 37:34.168
He's been in jail.
He sobered up.

37:34.203 --> 37:36.337
Jail. For real?

37:36.371 --> 37:39.340
Hey, hey, don't mess with that.
That's some serious horse there.

37:39.374 --> 37:41.142
Hey, what they send you in there for?

37:42.511 --> 37:43.544
Nothing.

37:43.579 --> 37:46.381
Yeah. One time I did two
years in a three-to-five.

37:46.415 --> 37:48.616
I came out of that.

37:48.651 --> 37:50.018
They nearly had me clean.

37:50.052 --> 37:51.152
Aubry.

37:51.186 --> 37:53.821
Nearly. Man.

37:53.856 --> 37:56.224
Aubry. That's good.

37:56.258 --> 37:57.091
Come on, aubry.

37:57.126 --> 38:00.194
Yo! Come on, Stevie! We're partying!

38:03.399 --> 38:05.800
That's him, man. Th-that's
the dude who ripped me off!

38:05.834 --> 38:06.701
Beat his ass!

38:06.735 --> 38:08.036
Carter!

38:10.205 --> 38:11.839
Hey!

38:18.213 --> 38:19.013
Come on!

38:20.516 --> 38:22.116
Come on!

39:07.963 --> 39:11.632
Things just work
out, you know? They do.

39:11.667 --> 39:14.869
They were bananas getting
here, but we're fixed now.

39:14.903 --> 39:16.738
We are fixed.

39:16.772 --> 39:17.872
You killed him.

39:20.476 --> 39:23.277
He was gonna kill you.

39:23.312 --> 39:25.913
All he was gonna do...
He was gonna kick my ass.

39:25.948 --> 39:27.882
And I should've let him?

39:27.916 --> 39:30.318
Seriously, I should've
just let him kick your ass

39:30.352 --> 39:32.153
and just let the cops haul you in?

39:32.187 --> 39:33.788
They're going to go to the police.

39:33.822 --> 39:35.556
And bitch about
how we stole the drugs

39:35.591 --> 39:36.991
they were gonna sell to schoolchildren?

39:37.026 --> 39:38.826
They're not going to the police.

39:38.861 --> 39:42.063
You tore up his ass before,
and he didn't tell anybody.

39:42.097 --> 39:43.898
Look, we started the day with nothing,

39:43.932 --> 39:45.833
now we got maybe $1,000 worth of product.

39:45.868 --> 39:48.903
You telling me we can't
get to Vietnam on this?

39:48.937 --> 39:50.071
We do this,

39:50.105 --> 39:52.640
we float a little bit, then
we push some, we get paid,

39:52.674 --> 39:54.142
and we get out.

39:54.176 --> 39:55.843
Then it's you and me.

39:55.878 --> 39:59.113
It's you and me just like
the people in the magazines.

40:00.182 --> 40:05.286
You can sit there and be
where joy goes to die...

40:05.320 --> 40:08.122
Or you can come get some.

40:10.025 --> 40:13.194
But I'm having a party,

40:13.228 --> 40:15.329
and all by myself if I got to.

40:16.799 --> 40:19.333
- Where the hell are you?!
- We're trying to find you.

40:19.368 --> 40:21.217
- W-where are they?!
- If you can give me an address,

40:21.217 --> 40:23.628
- anything that might...
- I-I-I-I don't have an address!

40:23.628 --> 40:24.639
Sir, do you hear sirens?

40:24.673 --> 40:26.874
Look, we're at a hotel, okay?!

40:26.909 --> 40:27.742
W-we're at a motel!

40:27.776 --> 40:29.977
Sir, the paramedics are on their way.

40:30.012 --> 40:31.012
Please stay where you are.

40:33.549 --> 40:36.617
Aubrey, baby.

40:36.652 --> 40:39.821
I love you. Come on... get up.

40:39.855 --> 40:42.957
Get up, Aubry, get up!

40:42.991 --> 40:46.527
Come on, baby. Come on, baby, please.

40:46.562 --> 40:49.163
Please don't leave me. don't leave me, baby.

40:49.198 --> 40:50.998
Aubry!

40:51.033 --> 40:53.000
Sir, I'm gonna
need you to step away.

40:53.035 --> 40:55.870
- Tell me what happened.
- Get up, Aubry, get up!

40:55.904 --> 40:57.972
No!

40:58.006 --> 40:59.407
- My girlfriend.
- Looks like an overdose.

40:59.441 --> 41:00.842
- She's not responsive.
- Yeah, yeah.

41:00.876 --> 41:02.910
- What kind?
- Heroin, man, all right?

41:02.945 --> 41:05.046
Just... just wake her up! All right?!

41:05.080 --> 41:06.414
Wake her up!

41:06.448 --> 41:08.082
Wake her up!

41:08.117 --> 41:09.083
Aubry!

41:15.290 --> 41:16.891
Aubry make it?

41:20.729 --> 41:22.930
Where is she?

41:22.965 --> 41:25.533
Where's Aubry?
