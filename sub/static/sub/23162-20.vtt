WEBVTT

00:02.453 --> 00:05.183
One million dollars!
How about that?

00:06.657 --> 00:07.681
Take them away.

00:07.758 --> 00:12.252
Is that cannon fire I hear,
or merely the beating of my heart?

00:12.330 --> 00:14.491
Are you going to bail us out
or not?

00:14.565 --> 00:16.396
T.C.: What exactly did he say?

00:16.467 --> 00:18.867
He used words like "rotting"
and "hell freezing over."

00:18.936 --> 00:20.403
But don't worry.
I'm sure he'll come.

00:20.471 --> 00:23.406
Hi, guys. Hop in.
I want you to meet my fiancÃ©e, Jeannie.

00:23.474 --> 00:24.532
I'm here.

00:24.609 --> 00:25.803
Shut up!
Shut up!

00:25.877 --> 00:28.345
The Board of Directors has
relieved you of your duties.

00:28.412 --> 00:30.004
What?
You've been fired.

01:41.986 --> 01:46.150
Heck, no!
We won't go! Heck, no! We won't go!

01:51.829 --> 01:53.262
Come on, guys.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.761
Cut it out!
Come on, cut it out!

01:55.866 --> 01:57.231
Come on, guys.

01:57.535 --> 02:01.437
Chanting slogans isn't going
to get this done. Now, come on.

02:04.508 --> 02:06.373
Let's try
talking to him again.

02:06.510 --> 02:09.308
I am through talking.
T.C.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.541
You have ten seconds
to vacate this property.

02:11.615 --> 02:15.483
Otherwise, you will be arrested.
This is your final warning.

02:15.987 --> 02:18.581
I'm going to kill him.
You can't kill him.

02:19.123 --> 02:20.647
Five seconds.

02:21.092 --> 02:22.923
Let's try talking to him
again, okay?

02:23.060 --> 02:24.152
Time's up.

02:24.228 --> 02:27.789
Guys, get off the lot. Come on,
go over by the van. Get out of the way.

02:28.265 --> 02:29.892
Come on, get out of there.

02:30.001 --> 02:31.696
You okay?
Mmm-hmm.

02:31.769 --> 02:34.431
Now, don't do
anything foolish.

02:36.207 --> 02:37.367
Sergeant, do your duty.

02:37.441 --> 02:38.806
Mr. Boyer, please.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.399
Kenny, give us a second.

02:40.478 --> 02:41.968
No. Arrest them.

02:42.046 --> 02:44.947
Look, Magnum, T.C.,
if you'll just leave...

02:45.016 --> 02:47.075
I am not leaving.

02:47.151 --> 02:49.278
He's got a court order.
- Come on, T.C.

02:49.353 --> 02:52.186
And I intend to have it
executed. One way or another.

02:52.256 --> 02:55.555
This clubhouse has been here
for six years. Six long years...

02:55.626 --> 02:58.925
However, Mr. Calvin,
the property does not belong to you.

02:58.996 --> 03:00.964
It belongs to
Dennis MacKenzie lndustries.

03:01.032 --> 03:03.796
Who gave T.C. permission to build
the clubhouse in the first place.

03:03.868 --> 03:05.995
He changed his mind.
Why?

03:06.070 --> 03:09.369
I don't know.
He just does that sometimes.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.466
Maybe he found out that
this so-called clubhouse

03:12.543 --> 03:17.207
was a meeting place for gang members,
and vagrants and runaways.

03:17.381 --> 03:18.939
That's a lie!

03:19.016 --> 03:22.452
Dennis MacKenzie lndustries
has an image to uphold.

03:22.520 --> 03:25.683
I have, too. I'm just trying to do
something positive for these kids.

03:25.756 --> 03:29.783
You know, coach a little basketball,
maybe just rap with them if necessary.

03:29.860 --> 03:32.385
Just to let them know that there
are adults that give a damn.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.693
Oh, I'm quite touched.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.692
Leave.

03:37.802 --> 03:40.771
No. T.C., now,
take it easy. Come on.

03:41.672 --> 03:44.072
Come on,
we'll find a new place.

03:44.542 --> 03:48.740
Mr. Boyer,
what if we rent the lot?

03:49.380 --> 03:52.247
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

03:53.751 --> 03:55.378
Okay.

03:56.153 --> 03:59.247
This property is
worth about

04:00.524 --> 04:01.821
five grand a month.

04:01.892 --> 04:03.291
Oh, come on.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.191
Sell your Ferrari.

04:05.262 --> 04:07.958
It's not my...
It's not his Ferrari.

04:08.032 --> 04:11.468
Oh. What a role model.

04:12.436 --> 04:14.597
Obviously then you're kept.

04:15.773 --> 04:17.262
I am not kept!

04:17.374 --> 04:18.500
To be sure.

04:18.942 --> 04:20.410
Easy, Thomas...

04:21.212 --> 04:22.736
Magnum.
Arrest them.

04:22.813 --> 04:24.644
We're not leaving until we
get some kind of answer.

04:24.715 --> 04:26.114
Sorry, guys...
Knock it down!

04:26.417 --> 04:27.816
Knock it down!

04:27.885 --> 04:30.752
Ow! And add on assault
with a deadly weapon.

04:30.821 --> 04:32.152
He's handcuffed!

04:32.223 --> 04:33.451
He hurt my arm.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.459
You just wait till we're out.
You haven't heard the last of us.

04:36.527 --> 04:39.018
And add abusive and
threatening language to him.

04:39.096 --> 04:40.620
Take them away.

05:15.132 --> 05:18.659
This is one of the more
depressing sights I've ever witnessed.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.000
Indeed, positively pathetic.

05:22.072 --> 05:26.270
Maybe not. I think I may be able
to get them out on a technicality,

05:26.343 --> 05:29.403
i.e., Davis
vs. Wyoming, 1923.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.107
You see, the plaintiff,
one Sidney Davis...

05:31.182 --> 05:34.083
Please, these gentlemen have already
secured competent counsel. Thank you.

05:34.151 --> 05:36.585
I'm very cheap, though.
I'm sure you are.

05:36.654 --> 05:37.780
As I was saying...

05:37.855 --> 05:41.120
Higgins. Say it later.
Just bail us out.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.556
Bail you out?
As if I were at your beck and call

05:43.627 --> 05:46.858
each time you run afoul of the
laws of the state and common sense.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.626
Do you realize
that you've called me away

05:48.699 --> 05:52.157
from a critical meeting of the
Anglo-Polynesian Annual Charities Drive

05:52.236 --> 05:55.205
to retrieve a couple of
miscreants out of jail for...

05:55.306 --> 05:57.570
Trespassing,
malicious mischief,

05:57.641 --> 06:00.508
assault with a deadly weapon
and threats thereof.

06:00.578 --> 06:04.070
I was just trying to help T.C.
help his kids,

06:04.148 --> 06:06.514
because some bozo was
trying to kick them off...

06:06.584 --> 06:08.017
His land.

06:08.085 --> 06:09.985
Which he wasn't going to do
anything with anyway.

06:10.054 --> 06:13.512
That is beside
the point. Why did you resist?

06:13.657 --> 06:17.024
We didn't
intentionally resist.

06:17.795 --> 06:20.992
It was more like
civil disobedience. Like...

06:21.065 --> 06:22.657
Thoreau.
Please, Mr...

06:22.900 --> 06:24.834
Dwayne Bailey, Esquire.

06:24.902 --> 06:28.702
Although I may sympathize with your goals,
your methods leave a great deal to be desired.

06:28.772 --> 06:31.832
Furthermore... Are you
going to bail us out or not?

06:31.976 --> 06:34.206
I am.
I just have one question.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.972
Why me?
Why didn't you call Rick?

06:36.046 --> 06:37.843
You have two lawyers?

06:39.083 --> 06:41.574
He was still in Albuquerque
on business.

06:41.752 --> 06:43.549
He was due back
three days ago.

06:43.687 --> 06:45.052
Yeah, he was.

06:45.122 --> 06:47.215
Perhaps something
has gone wrong with him.

06:47.291 --> 06:49.759
I know he would have called if
he was going to stay longer.

06:49.827 --> 06:53.456
Then perhaps you two should
worry about your other "kid."

06:57.401 --> 06:59.426
You may release them.

07:15.052 --> 07:16.781
Sorry, Dwayne.

07:20.124 --> 07:22.456
I do know
what you're thinking.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.687
Having that situation
at T.C. 's clubhouse

07:24.762 --> 07:28.858
escalate into assault with a deadly
weapon was pretty ridiculous.

07:29.466 --> 07:33.459
Now we had more to worry about than just
where T. C. 's kids were going to go.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.262
But on the other hand,

07:35.339 --> 07:39.139
my little voice was trying to get
my attention about something else.

07:39.243 --> 07:41.871
And even though I couldn't
pin it down to specifics,

07:41.945 --> 07:44.880
the one thing I kept getting
was Rick.

07:44.982 --> 07:46.813
I just hoped
it wasn't trouble.

07:53.691 --> 07:56.353
Well, my friend,
your troubles are over!

07:56.427 --> 08:00.625
You've just won $500,000 on The
Great Western States Lottery,

08:01.365 --> 08:04.391
Iive from Albuquerque,
New Mexico.

08:04.468 --> 08:06.436
Come down here, Miguel.
Come on.

08:07.371 --> 08:09.931
Well, when you came out
on this stage,

08:10.007 --> 08:13.568
you were a mere cannery worker
from Monterrey, California.

08:13.644 --> 08:15.908
And now you're a rich man.

08:15.979 --> 08:17.640
Come on, tell us, Miguel.
We're all dying to know.

08:17.715 --> 08:19.910
What are you going to do
with all this money?

08:19.983 --> 08:22.474
I will buy
the cannery, senor.

08:22.653 --> 08:24.644
He's going to buy the canary.

08:24.822 --> 08:27.848
Go buy it, Miguel,
go buy it.

08:31.228 --> 08:33.559
Okay.
Let's meet our next finalist.

08:33.630 --> 08:38.499
She's young, she's beautiful,
she's from Hollywood, she's Mandy Smith!

08:40.904 --> 08:43.998
Well, hello, Mandy.
Hello.

08:44.073 --> 08:46.702
Hello there. Well, now,
it says here you're an actress.

08:46.777 --> 08:49.803
Have you been in anything
we may have seen?

08:49.880 --> 08:51.905
Well, maybe.

08:52.316 --> 08:55.479
I see. Why don't you tell all
the folks about how you came to

08:55.552 --> 08:58.112
get your winning
lottery ticket.

08:58.322 --> 09:02.053
Well, I was standing in the
unemployment line reading the trades

09:02.159 --> 09:05.526
and I met this producer who
had a bunch of lottery tickets.

09:05.596 --> 09:06.585
Oh!

09:06.830 --> 09:09.628
Anyway, he asked me
to be in his next picture.

09:10.534 --> 09:12.764
Yes, I think they're trying to tell
me we're running a little long,

09:12.836 --> 09:14.997
so why don't we
spin the wheel?

09:17.040 --> 09:18.530
Here we go!

09:31.155 --> 09:33.589
Oh. $10,000.

09:35.826 --> 09:36.815
All right?

09:36.894 --> 09:38.225
Yeah, great.

09:38.295 --> 09:41.628
Yeah, well, have you any plans
for the $10,000, Mandy?

09:41.832 --> 09:43.732
I'm gonna have some pictures
made of me.

09:43.801 --> 09:46.599
Oh, some new pictures made.
Oh, well!

09:47.237 --> 09:50.695
Hope it all develops well
for your career. Really do.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.942
Well, what a night!

09:53.010 --> 09:56.138
The suspense is really beginning
to mount all the time now,

09:56.213 --> 10:00.582
because none of our finalists so
far have hit the big seven figures.

10:00.651 --> 10:04.417
So there's three million big
ones still up there, come on.

10:04.555 --> 10:08.719
I want to give it away!
I want to give it away now!

10:10.661 --> 10:14.222
Our next winner comes all the way
from the land of hula and Don Ho,

10:14.298 --> 10:17.495
the manager of one of Paradise's
most prestigious clubs,

10:17.568 --> 10:19.832
Iet's all meet Orville Wright!

10:25.242 --> 10:27.210
Welcome to Albuquerque.

10:27.277 --> 10:28.403
Call me Rick.

10:28.479 --> 10:31.744
Oh, "Call me Rick," he says.
Okay, Ricky, are you excited?

10:31.915 --> 10:33.382
Yeah.

10:34.017 --> 10:37.680
Try to keep your answers
as brief as possible, Rick.

10:37.955 --> 10:40.515
Tell me, how did you get
your winning lottery ticket?

10:40.591 --> 10:43.185
Well, I bought it.

10:43.260 --> 10:45.888
Did you hear that?
He bought it.

10:45.963 --> 10:47.658
Ladies and gentlemen,
he bought it.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.790
Tell us a bit more
about yourself. Married?

10:49.867 --> 10:51.562
Oh, no.
No.

10:51.668 --> 10:53.727
How about single then?

10:54.838 --> 10:58.274
Come on, Rick.
It's time we gave this wheel a whirl.

10:58.342 --> 11:00.537
Give it a real good rip, Rick.

11:00.611 --> 11:04.547
The other way, Rick.
Clockwise, okay? Right. Right.

11:04.615 --> 11:07.846
The wrong way, come on.
Clockwise, clockwise, okay?

11:22.432 --> 11:24.957
About time we had a big one, now.
Come on.

11:31.508 --> 11:36.343
Incredible! One million dollars!
How about that?

11:37.347 --> 11:38.814
You've won...

11:38.882 --> 11:39.871
Please!

11:44.154 --> 11:46.987
Just a minute, come here.
Come here, just a minute.

11:47.057 --> 11:49.082
How you feeling?
How you feeling?

11:49.192 --> 11:51.456
Oh, fine. Just fine.
Fine?

11:51.828 --> 11:55.025
I wouldn't feel too bad either
with $1,000,000 in my pocket.

11:55.098 --> 11:57.362
Come on, now.
What are you going to do with the money?

11:57.434 --> 12:01.336
Rick, what are you going to do
with the money?

12:01.705 --> 12:04.435
I'm going to spend it!
He's going to spend it.

12:04.508 --> 12:08.911
One million dollars.
He's gonna spend it.

12:11.915 --> 12:15.749
Oh, go on, Rick.
You're spending some of it now, Rick.

12:16.053 --> 12:18.817
That will cost you.
That will cost you.

12:25.878 --> 12:27.277
Hi, this is Thomas Magnum.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.042
I'm unable to take your call
right now,

12:29.115 --> 12:31.310
but if you'll leave a message
I'll get right back to you.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.420
Thomas, you're not gonna
believe what happened.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.045
You're not gonna believe it.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.886
Go ahead, just guess. Guess.
Guess what happened.

12:39.192 --> 12:43.595
I just... I can't tell it to a machine.
I got to call you back.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.861
Rick? Rick?

12:52.805 --> 12:55.273
Give everybody here
at the bar a drink.

12:55.341 --> 12:59.277
In fact, give the whole house
a drink, Rico, it's on me.

12:59.345 --> 13:00.869
Yes, sir.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.174
Cheers.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.239
Cheers.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.253
I saw you on TV.
Well, thank you.

13:18.598 --> 13:22.830
Say. Would you mind playing
my favorite song?

13:22.902 --> 13:25.166
As Time Goes By.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.765
For that money
I'll play it all night, pal.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.433
Thanks.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.440
Thank you.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.481
You can have
anything you want.

14:10.616 --> 14:12.846
I was talking about the song.

14:12.919 --> 14:17.151
You just played my favorite
song in the whole wide world.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.349
As Time Goes By.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.583
As Time Goes By.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.019
Bogie and...

14:22.094 --> 14:23.959
Bergman.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.462
Would you have
a drink with me?

14:29.535 --> 14:32.129
Oh, I'd love it.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.408
My name is Jeannie.

14:40.513 --> 14:41.673
I'm Rick.

14:41.747 --> 14:44.545
I know. I saw you on TV.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.743
No kidding.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.183
Yes.
That's something.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.120
What would you like
to drink?

14:50.256 --> 14:52.190
I would like white wine,
please.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.314
Uh-uh.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.355
Champagne.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.843
You know, this is one song
you can never get tired of.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.463
Just like Bogie and lngrid.
What was that she said

15:31.531 --> 15:34.227
that day at the outdoor cafe
somewhere in Paris?

15:34.634 --> 15:36.397
She said,

15:36.469 --> 15:41.463
"ls that cannon fire I hear,
or merely the beating of my heart?"

15:41.908 --> 15:44.308
Or something like that.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.776
That's it.
That's exactly what she said.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.686
One more time, Sam.
Play it again.

15:55.454 --> 15:59.652
Wow,
this is really something.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.960
And I'm not just saying that because
you won a million dollars either.

16:04.163 --> 16:09.726
Whoever thought that I would meet somebody
like you right here in the Albuquerque Arms?

16:09.835 --> 16:11.700
That goes both ways.

16:11.938 --> 16:18.002
I mean I'm just a travel agent from Wichita
doing a survey on the hotels of the Southwest,

16:18.077 --> 16:24.414
and here I go and meet some big-shot
club manager from Hawaii named Rick.

16:25.051 --> 16:29.181
Just like Humphrey Bogart in
Casablanca was named Rick, too.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.580
God, it's dÃ©jÃ  vu
or something.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.985
Well,
I'm not really a big shot.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.927
You're so humble, too.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.225
When do you have to go
back to Hawaii?

16:42.401 --> 16:44.699
Tomorrow.

16:44.971 --> 16:48.930
You know, my friends
don't even know what happened.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.739
I mean, I've got to call them.
When do you have to be back to Wichita?

16:52.812 --> 16:56.612
I don't.
I mean, not right away.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.994
Listen.

17:10.730 --> 17:14.393
Why don't you come to Hawaii and
survey some of the hotels there?

17:15.233 --> 17:19.671
Is this cannon fire I hear or
merely the beating of my heart?

17:20.573 --> 17:25.532
It's the sound of a 747, baby, taxiing
down a runway to Hawaii with you on it.

17:26.945 --> 17:28.573
You're kidding?
Uh-uh.

17:28.648 --> 17:29.740
You're not kidding?

17:29.815 --> 17:30.804
Uh-uh.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.214
I can't.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.575
What?

17:34.654 --> 17:37.020
I can't. I mean,
I don't even know you.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.647
Yes, you do.

17:38.724 --> 17:43.752
Jeannie, you said it.
It's like dÃ©jÃ  vu or something.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.356
It was meant to be.

17:46.932 --> 17:52.165
Listen, if you don't give each one of
us a chance to get to know each other,

17:52.238 --> 17:55.765
if you go back to Wichita and
I go to Hawaii,

17:55.841 --> 18:00.471
well, it's almost like going to a movie
and walking out before the ending is there.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.710
Come on, what do you say?
Give it a shot.

18:07.286 --> 18:09.117
Please.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.750
Here's looking at you, kid.

18:35.881 --> 18:39.476
Night passed, the sun rose
and still no further word from Rick.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.520
However, whatever trouble
he was in

18:41.587 --> 18:44.351
seemed to pale with what
T. C. and I were up against.

18:44.423 --> 18:47.824
Namely, the personification
- Blair Boyer.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.053
We were hoping, though,

18:49.128 --> 18:51.892
that if all parties concerned behaved
like rational human beings and

18:51.964 --> 18:56.833
had a real good heart-to-heart away from the
high tension of yesterday's confrontation,

18:57.103 --> 18:59.594
that surely something
would get worked out.

19:00.106 --> 19:03.507
Mr. Boyer's busy.
He can't see you now.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.808
You'll have to leave.

19:06.879 --> 19:07.937
We'll wait.

19:08.013 --> 19:10.641
I really don't think that's
going to do a lot of good.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.819
See, Mr. Boyer has many
scheduled appointments

19:13.886 --> 19:15.649
and a lot of phone calls
to make.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.985
Fine. We've got time.
Don't we?

19:18.090 --> 19:19.819
Nothing but.

19:33.038 --> 19:36.303
Perhaps I am not
communicating properly.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.910
Mr. Boyer will not see
either of you gentlemen.

19:40.146 --> 19:42.740
Is that the only door
to his office?

19:43.849 --> 19:44.975
Yes.

19:45.050 --> 19:47.075
Then he'll see us.

20:24.356 --> 20:27.757
If I were you, I'd leave. Now.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.526
Debralee.

20:31.897 --> 20:36.266
Ms. Worthy,
all we want to do is talk to him.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.595
He doesn't want
to talk to you.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.063
We're willing
to be reasonable.

20:41.140 --> 20:45.099
We'd just like for him to meet us halfway
so that we can resolve this thing.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.475
It was resolved yesterday.

20:47.646 --> 20:51.980
Today you're just looking at a
lot of trouble if you hang around.

20:52.384 --> 20:56.115
What exactly
do you mean by that?

20:56.755 --> 20:58.382
You've been warned.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.525
Warned? Wait a minute,
mama, you don't...

21:00.593 --> 21:02.288
Easy, easy. Remember?

21:03.896 --> 21:07.093
Right. No problem.

21:07.900 --> 21:13.202
You just go back to work and we
will sit here quietly and wait.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.505
Your waiting is over,

21:18.577 --> 21:21.569
but you may be doing
a little sitting for a while.

21:29.688 --> 21:32.122
Ah, my clients are back.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.522
We're not your clients.

21:33.592 --> 21:35.822
Well, you should be or you
wouldn't be back in here.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.556
Yeah, well, what about you?

21:37.763 --> 21:42.063
Consider this my office, if you will.
My suite. I am here to serve.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.261
Then go play some tennis.

21:44.603 --> 21:47.071
When did Higgins say he was
gonna get us out of here?

21:47.273 --> 21:49.207
He didn't exactly.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.372
Well, what exactly did he say?

21:51.443 --> 21:53.968
He used words like "rotting"
and "hell freezing over."

21:54.046 --> 21:55.604
But don't worry,
I'm sure he'll come.

21:55.681 --> 21:56.909
I'm here.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.143
Shut up!
Shut up!

21:59.785 --> 22:02.185
You're out.

22:03.555 --> 22:05.989
Please don't come back.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.662
Where's Higgie baby?

22:19.805 --> 22:21.670
Who cares?
At least he got us out.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.072
And this way we don't have to
listen to one of his lectures.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.577
We can concentrate on getting
to Dennis MacKenzie himself.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.044
Mr. Magnum? Mr. Calvin?

22:28.113 --> 22:31.446
My name's Paul.
If you'll follow me, please.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.185
T.C.: This can't be real.

22:36.255 --> 22:39.281
In fact, the last two days
can't be real.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.417
This must be a nightmare
or a dream or...

22:42.494 --> 22:44.985
Or Higgins has gone
completely nuts.

22:49.835 --> 22:51.063
Hi, guys. Hop in.

22:51.136 --> 22:52.933
We'll take care of
your little problem later.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.269
But first I want you to meet
my fiancÃ©e, Jeannie.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.241
Jeannie, say hello
Hi.

22:57.309 --> 22:59.504
to two of the best pals
a guy could have.

22:59.578 --> 23:02.206
Well,
what are you waiting for?

23:23.969 --> 23:27.200
Cornell, it's about time
we made our move.

23:27.306 --> 23:30.400
Uh-huh. While he still got
some of it left.

23:40.068 --> 23:41.262
Except for Robin Masters,

23:41.336 --> 23:44.328
I've never known anyone
who was a millionaire before.

23:44.406 --> 23:48.536
And the difference between Robin and
Rick was that Robin already had his.

23:48.743 --> 23:51.041
With Rick,
it was sudden wealth.

23:51.179 --> 23:54.706
And that brought one of those
tripartite questions to mind:

23:55.350 --> 23:59.844
How would the money change Rick,
or me, or our friendship?

24:00.055 --> 24:01.522
I didn't know
about the first one,

24:01.589 --> 24:05.616
although Rick did offer T. C. whatever he
needed to get land for a new clubhouse.

24:06.494 --> 24:08.291
But T. C. refused.

24:08.363 --> 24:11.890
He wanted to demonstrate to his
kids there was a principle involved.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.392
Rick didn't
exactly understand.

24:14.469 --> 24:16.562
But maybe
that's what love does to you.

24:16.638 --> 24:21.598
Especially when you're also trying to
grasp the principles of five-card draw.

24:21.943 --> 24:25.936
I am on a roll.
Ice Pick, it is up to you.

24:27.082 --> 24:28.913
As if you needed it.

24:29.184 --> 24:34.247
But then again, maybe he did
grasp them, or maybe he was just lucky.

24:34.823 --> 24:37.223
I'm in for 1,000.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.087
See it.

24:39.627 --> 24:40.821
Call.

24:40.895 --> 24:43.386
No problem.

24:45.934 --> 24:47.834
Two cards.

24:53.675 --> 24:55.302
Give me three.

24:56.978 --> 24:58.206
I'll take the lid.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.906
You got it, baby.

25:07.188 --> 25:09.418
Dealer stands pat.

25:10.892 --> 25:12.757
You wouldn't be bluffing,
would you?

25:18.233 --> 25:20.360
Another thousand.

25:21.503 --> 25:22.834
I'm history.

25:22.904 --> 25:27.534
Call the thousand.
And raise you 2,000.

25:30.044 --> 25:33.980
Well, I'm going to see your thousand,

25:34.749 --> 25:38.776
your two and I raise

25:40.789 --> 25:42.916
$5,000.

25:44.859 --> 25:47.350
Too rich for my blood.

25:48.930 --> 25:52.593
Excuse me.
I got to make a pit stop.

25:55.703 --> 25:57.227
Where's more beer?

25:57.338 --> 26:00.637
In the kitchen. Jeannie's in
there making some sandwiches.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.712
You got to stop playing
crazy poker like this.

26:07.782 --> 26:10.182
You're gonna make them mad,
and they'll leave.

26:10.251 --> 26:13.186
Or worse. They'll come back.
Now, what did you have?

26:15.089 --> 26:16.522
Pair of threes.
Ah...

26:16.591 --> 26:18.991
That's what I thought.
Be careful, will you?

26:19.060 --> 26:21.528
Listen, I just won
$40,000. Who cares?

26:21.596 --> 26:22.790
I care.

26:22.864 --> 26:26.527
I like you like a son, and I don't
like the smell of these guys.

26:26.601 --> 26:27.659
Who are they?

26:28.269 --> 26:29.566
Just some guys.

26:29.671 --> 26:34.199
Nobody gambles this kind of
money that is just some guys.

26:34.509 --> 26:37.000
Now, where do you
know them from?

26:37.812 --> 26:39.507
From the beachfront bar.

26:39.647 --> 26:41.444
They're record producers
or something.

26:41.583 --> 26:44.245
You know,
l almost feel kind of sorry for them.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.184
Hi, baby.

26:47.655 --> 26:49.213
Thanks
for the sandwiches.

26:49.290 --> 26:51.053
No problem.

26:51.259 --> 26:53.887
Look, would you mind if I took
a little walk around the beach?

26:53.962 --> 26:56.123
As long as you come back.
Kiss-kiss.

26:58.900 --> 26:59.924
Mmm.

27:00.001 --> 27:01.901
You bet.

27:04.405 --> 27:06.066
Deal.

27:08.109 --> 27:09.542
Ante two.

27:09.944 --> 27:11.002
My two's in.

27:11.079 --> 27:12.205
I'm in.

27:35.637 --> 27:38.936
Hi, Higgins.
I thought you were going home.

27:39.007 --> 27:40.565
I intended to.

27:40.642 --> 27:43.543
But then it was pointed out to me
that we were woefully low on supplies

27:43.611 --> 27:44.703
because none have been
ordered,

27:44.779 --> 27:47.771
that the painting on the terrace has
not been completed because the painters

27:47.849 --> 27:48.873
were not issued a check,

27:48.950 --> 27:52.113
and that the King Kamehameha Club
Charity 10K Run may not take place

27:52.186 --> 27:56.714
because the club manager failed to
obtain the street permit in time.

27:58.026 --> 28:00.654
And now I find, that instead of
finally fulfilling your obligations,

28:00.728 --> 28:03.754
you have compounded your dereliction
by closing off the Anuenue Room

28:03.831 --> 28:06.163
in order to gamble, drink
and womanize

28:06.234 --> 28:09.101
on King Kamehameha Club time
and property!

28:10.705 --> 28:13.105
You are hereby on notice,
Rick, that any further failure

28:13.174 --> 28:14.539
to fulfill your
responsibilities here

28:14.609 --> 28:16.338
will result in your
summary dismissal.

28:16.411 --> 28:18.606
Am I making myself clear?

28:19.013 --> 28:20.480
Yes, Higgins.

28:31.359 --> 28:33.293
Deal.

28:39.400 --> 28:43.200
By the by,
the Anglo-Polynesian Charities Drive

28:43.271 --> 28:46.763
is looking for a principal sponsor
for their indigent elderly program.

28:46.841 --> 28:48.775
I'm sure that a sizeable
contribution from you

28:48.843 --> 28:53.041
would go a long way toward uplifting
your posture in the community.

28:59.387 --> 29:02.618
It looks like
the party's over.

29:03.324 --> 29:07.317
Yeah, but we'll be back.
You know, you owe us a few hands.

29:07.695 --> 29:10.289
And you owe me
about $40,000.

29:12.266 --> 29:15.724
Trust us. We'll be back.

29:16.270 --> 29:17.362
When?

29:17.605 --> 29:19.835
Later. 10:00.

29:20.408 --> 29:24.174
You can keep time with this
until then. Okay?

29:26.080 --> 29:29.345
Sure. Why not?
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

29:31.552 --> 29:34.020
Man, you're naive.
That might be a fake.

29:34.088 --> 29:37.751
Who cares,
I like the action, I like the juice.

29:38.226 --> 29:41.787
Besides, I'm rich.

29:42.797 --> 29:46.358
Sometimes that's not
a permanent condition.

29:46.701 --> 29:50.262
Remember what I told you,
be careful.

29:58.012 --> 29:59.138
I was careful.

30:00.314 --> 30:03.112
Careful? You set off
every alarm in the place.

30:03.184 --> 30:04.344
It was accidental!

30:04.419 --> 30:06.717
It was clumsy!
I thought you were a pro.

30:06.788 --> 30:09.689
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
what seems to be the problem?

30:09.757 --> 30:12.055
The initial consultation is,
of course, free.

30:12.126 --> 30:14.094
He got us arrested again!

30:14.162 --> 30:15.254
I can see that.

30:15.329 --> 30:17.490
Because I was trying
to help him!

30:17.565 --> 30:19.396
Yeah, some help.

30:19.467 --> 30:22.334
I used my contacts
at the Hall of Records,

30:22.403 --> 30:25.736
to find out where the real
Dennis MacKenzie actually lives.

30:25.807 --> 30:27.365
We went there to talk to him,
but...

30:27.442 --> 30:30.707
And the estate was locked,
the intercom was broken.

30:30.845 --> 30:33.473
And he talked me into
climbing over the fence.

30:33.548 --> 30:35.982
I think I could plea bargain
it down to simple trespassing.

30:36.050 --> 30:39.110
No, no, no! Listen to the whole thing!
Dennis MacKenzie wasn't there.

30:39.187 --> 30:40.848
Just a mean old
junkyard dog...

30:40.922 --> 30:42.947
Boyer.
You didn't kill him, did you?

30:43.024 --> 30:44.719
No!
No!

30:45.059 --> 30:47.425
What about the dog?

30:59.140 --> 31:00.903
Rosine?
Still no sign of Jeannie?

31:02.343 --> 31:03.469
Thanks.

31:03.778 --> 31:04.870
Jeannie?

31:06.080 --> 31:08.640
Higgins. Higgins, can you
please come back tomorrow?

31:08.716 --> 31:11.549
Yes, yes, I will.
I'll be back tomorrow

31:11.619 --> 31:14.144
to see that you are completely
moved out of this apartment.

31:14.222 --> 31:15.211
What?

31:15.289 --> 31:18.520
The Board of Directors has
relieved you of your duties.

31:19.327 --> 31:21.295
What?
You've been fired.

31:21.362 --> 31:22.351
Why?

31:22.430 --> 31:24.728
A matter of a last straw.

31:24.799 --> 31:25.823
What do you mean?

31:25.900 --> 31:29.734
There is not one single, solitary straw
in the bar with which to serve a drink.

31:29.904 --> 31:33.305
Unfortunately, there is a quorum
of the Board of Directors present

31:33.374 --> 31:36.468
and they like their drinks mixed
and their managers managing.

31:36.878 --> 31:39.438
They've sent me up here
to terminate you.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.610
I did try to warn you.

31:44.785 --> 31:47.811
I am sorry.
But there was a vote taken.

31:47.889 --> 31:50.449
You're a rich man now.
Enjoy it.

31:50.558 --> 31:54.927
Oh, by the by, you won't forget the
Anglo-Polynesian Charities Drive, will you?

31:55.796 --> 31:57.058
Hello.

31:57.365 --> 32:00.163
This is Cornell Dye,
your poker playing buddy.

32:00.268 --> 32:01.758
When are you guys coming back?

32:01.836 --> 32:03.394
We're not.

32:03.704 --> 32:06.400
You're not? What...
Now shut up and listen.

32:07.041 --> 32:11.307
There's been a change in plans. You
know, we don't like losing to amateurs.

32:11.445 --> 32:13.936
As a matter of fact,
we don't like losing, period.

32:14.048 --> 32:15.174
Listen, you...

32:15.249 --> 32:18.582
So instead of sitting down with
you and trying to win it all back,

32:18.653 --> 32:22.111
we've decided that
you'll just give it to us.

32:22.690 --> 32:26.558
And whatever you've got left
of your million as interest.

32:26.727 --> 32:32.222
You know, minus the lRS,
we estimate that at about 500,000 or so.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.032
You guys must be crazy.

32:35.469 --> 32:39.269
Maybe. But we've also got
your fiancÃ©e,

32:39.540 --> 32:41.804
and right now she looks
like she's in one piece.

32:41.909 --> 32:43.433
You're lying.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.241
Say hello, Jeannie.

32:49.850 --> 32:51.283
Rick.

32:51.619 --> 32:54.213
Lookout Point,
Diamond Head Crater. Dawn.

32:54.388 --> 32:56.720
It's money or love, pal.

33:04.765 --> 33:08.223
Cash. I need cash.

33:11.739 --> 33:12.763
I'll call you back.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.104
Rick, wait!
You can't call me back!

33:15.176 --> 33:16.165
I have to.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.007
We're in jail again.

33:18.145 --> 33:19.305
Call Higgins.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.641
He won't come.
Call Carol.

33:21.716 --> 33:24.549
Rick, I called you.
One phone call, remember?

33:24.719 --> 33:27.244
Forget it, Thomas. Look, I'm
trying to get hold of a banker.

33:27.321 --> 33:29.789
I'll take care of you guys later.
Rick.

33:29.857 --> 33:32.417
I can't talk now.
Can't you understand?

33:39.166 --> 33:41.999
Checkmate.

34:27.447 --> 34:29.074
The money.

34:29.216 --> 34:32.811
It's $420,000.
That's all I've got.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.945
Let's see it.

34:43.731 --> 34:45.322
I'll take it.

34:46.132 --> 34:48.829
Let the girl
out of the car first.

34:56.744 --> 34:58.109
Jeannie.

35:01.482 --> 35:04.042
Jeannie, are you all right?

35:06.087 --> 35:07.349
Jeannie?

35:14.195 --> 35:16.686
There's one born every minute.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.701
Jeannie!

35:37.685 --> 35:38.674
Jeannie.

35:42.572 --> 35:46.565
My Aunt Maggie used to say that
friendship was something like a sponge.

35:46.643 --> 35:48.873
It could soak up
a lot of garbage and gunk,

35:48.945 --> 35:52.176
but when you wrung it out,
you still had a sponge.

35:52.416 --> 35:56.409
Now, I'm not quite sure what that all meant,
but I did know as far as Rick was concerned,

35:56.486 --> 35:58.613
there was a whole lot of
wringing out to be done

35:58.688 --> 36:01.179
before that sponge
could be used again.

36:01.725 --> 36:05.786
T.C.: What? Does he think we're trying to
sponge off him and his millions or something?

36:06.029 --> 36:07.223
What's the matter
with him?

36:07.297 --> 36:11.199
Nothing. I'm fine.
Just a momentary lapse. That's all.

36:11.668 --> 36:14.466
I don't know.
Rick just sounded real upset.

36:14.805 --> 36:17.365
Yeah, banker wasn't at
his immediate disposal.

36:19.743 --> 36:22.906
It's funny how you think
you know someone,

36:23.113 --> 36:24.944
been through everything,

36:25.148 --> 36:28.811
then all of a sudden you find out
that you don't know them at all.

36:29.319 --> 36:30.684
I'm gonna kill him.

36:30.754 --> 36:34.349
Oh, no, come on. At least we gotta
talk to him first. Once we get out.

36:34.424 --> 36:35.413
If we get out.

36:35.492 --> 36:37.084
You guys are out.

36:40.930 --> 36:45.299
Who's springing us? Higgins?
Orville? Carol?

36:45.368 --> 36:46.733
Me.

37:29.612 --> 37:30.670
Yes.

37:30.747 --> 37:32.647
Higgins. It's me, Rick.
I've got to...

37:32.716 --> 37:34.684
Look, if you've come to plead
with me for your job back,

37:34.751 --> 37:36.878
there's virtually nothing
I can do about it.

37:36.953 --> 37:40.787
Higgins, I need your help.
Please! I brought your check.

37:41.591 --> 37:43.320
Very well.

37:51.735 --> 37:56.570
This is perhaps the most unbelievably
depressing story I've ever heard,

37:56.740 --> 37:59.106
and I've heard my share.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.305
It reminds me of the time...

38:02.379 --> 38:05.746
Higgins, Higgins, please.
Tell me about it later.

38:05.815 --> 38:09.376
Right now, I've got to find Thomas and
T.C. Do you have any idea where they are?

38:09.486 --> 38:11.818
I would presume in jail again.

38:11.888 --> 38:15.255
No, I called there. They've been bailed
out. I thought it might have been you.

38:15.325 --> 38:19.227
Hardly. However, I don't understand
your urgency. The crisis is over.

38:19.295 --> 38:21.286
You've lived and learned.

38:22.332 --> 38:26.496
And I will speak to the Board
about your reinstatement. Perhaps.

38:26.569 --> 38:30.596
The urgency is not over, Higgins.
I've got to find them.

38:30.673 --> 38:31.970
Why?

38:34.210 --> 38:37.338
I've got to tell them
that I'm sorry.

38:37.781 --> 38:39.305
The crisis may be over,

38:39.382 --> 38:42.078
but I really messed up,
messed up real bad,

38:42.152 --> 38:45.053
even worse than being made a
fool of or losing all my money.

38:46.456 --> 38:51.484
Look what it's done to me. I may have
lost my friends and maybe my job, too.

38:52.529 --> 38:57.262
I gotta set things right, Higgins.
And that goes for you, too.

38:58.134 --> 39:00.068
I'm sorry.

39:02.338 --> 39:04.306
Apology accepted.

39:05.375 --> 39:08.503
I don't know where they are,
but I venture to guess that it has something to do

39:08.578 --> 39:11.911
with the problem of Dennis MacKenzie
lndustries and T.C.'s Clubhouse.

39:11.981 --> 39:15.610
Though I seriously doubt that they are
downtown visiting Blair Boyer again.

39:15.685 --> 39:19.143
This time, they'd probably
get a life sentence.

39:19.222 --> 39:21.918
Yeah. But I wouldn't.

39:22.325 --> 39:24.418
Where are you going?

39:25.395 --> 39:27.454
I'm going for broke.

39:32.235 --> 39:35.068
I not only left him broke,
I broke his spirit, too.

39:36.139 --> 39:38.869
See, it was only supposed
to be a minor scam.

39:38.942 --> 39:40.933
I was gonna get tight
with him, set him up,

39:41.010 --> 39:43.478
then Cornell and Benny were
going to come in and to cheat him

39:43.546 --> 39:46.106
out of about a hundred grand
in the card game.

39:46.182 --> 39:47.615
Boom, we're out.

39:47.717 --> 39:48.775
But he won.

39:48.852 --> 39:52.083
That's because he didn't
play like a normal person.

39:52.856 --> 39:54.653
So Cornell got mad and...

39:54.724 --> 39:56.191
And decided to go for the whole thing.

39:56.259 --> 39:58.318
And I went along with it.

39:59.896 --> 40:01.193
Till now.

40:03.700 --> 40:04.689
That's it.

40:06.736 --> 40:08.704
Why did you change your mind?

40:08.771 --> 40:11.069
Because I found out
I liked him.

40:11.140 --> 40:15.634
When I couldn't shake the look on his
face after we left him standing all alone

40:15.712 --> 40:19.011
on that road,
I knew I had to tell him.

40:20.283 --> 40:24.720
But he won't talk to me. So I found
out where you were and I got you guys.

40:24.888 --> 40:26.651
You've got a good friend.

40:26.723 --> 40:30.386
But I guess, like a lot of people,
he has a couple of weak spots.

40:31.127 --> 40:34.187
And like a shark,
I went for them.

40:38.301 --> 40:40.201
Wait here.

41:02.825 --> 41:04.087
Who's there?

41:04.160 --> 41:05.650
Jeannie.

41:31.487 --> 41:33.352
The money!

41:57.513 --> 42:01.040
Sorry, toots,
but I tried to be reasonable.

42:04.520 --> 42:08.786
Damn it, I want those shares sold by the
time the market opens tomorrow morning.

42:08.858 --> 42:10.758
You got it? All of them!
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

42:10.827 --> 42:13.193
You know who you're talking to?
Do you? Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

42:13.262 --> 42:16.629
Nobody talks that way to Dennis
MacKenzie. Nobody. No, sir.

42:16.699 --> 42:20.897
Now, you dump those shares, or your
next job will be at the end of a broom

42:20.970 --> 42:23.632
sweeping up ticker tape from
the exchange floor! You got it?

42:23.706 --> 42:24.695
Yes, sir.

42:24.774 --> 42:28.870
The word "maybe" isn't in the
vocabulary of Dennis MacKenzie.

42:28.978 --> 42:30.240
You got that?
You bet.

42:30.313 --> 42:33.305
You got that? Now do the job.
Yes, sir.

42:36.352 --> 42:38.377
Debralee...

42:38.454 --> 42:41.048
Debralee is a little tied up
right now, Dennis.

42:41.124 --> 42:43.319
Is there something
I could do for you?

42:44.594 --> 42:46.289
It's Blair.
Uh-uh.

42:46.796 --> 42:51.426
It's Dennis MacKenzie. Now, that's
fraud or something, isn't it?

42:56.105 --> 42:58.232
What do you want?

42:59.008 --> 43:03.001
Not much. See, Dennis.
This is gonna be real easy.

43:06.716 --> 43:09.549
Rick was finally right
about something. It was real easy.

43:09.619 --> 43:13.953
In return for not revealing Dennis
MacKenzie's secret alter ego, Blair Boyer,

43:14.023 --> 43:17.322
T. C. got his clubhouse rebuilt and
all charges against us were dropped.

43:17.427 --> 43:20.055
As for trying to find
the money, we didn't.

43:20.296 --> 43:23.322
Now the only hard part
was saying good-bye.

43:23.433 --> 43:28.063
Jeannie, are you sure
you have to go?

43:28.571 --> 43:32.268
No. But I'd better.

43:32.842 --> 43:38.405
Not everything I told you was a lie.
The true part is I am from Kansas.

43:39.182 --> 43:41.275
My folks have a farm there.

43:41.651 --> 43:46.111
Things aren't going so good,
so I think maybe it's right I go back

43:46.222 --> 43:48.156
and try to
stick it out with them.

43:48.424 --> 43:50.619
You know, help.

43:51.094 --> 43:54.291
Like what you did
for your friends.

43:54.530 --> 43:55.690
And you for me.

43:57.667 --> 44:00.568
But we lost your money.

44:02.138 --> 44:04.038
Money isn't everything.

44:05.374 --> 44:07.399
Maybe.

44:10.580 --> 44:12.275
Here.

44:13.249 --> 44:14.739
What?

44:15.184 --> 44:18.950
I hocked the pearls and all
the clothes you bought me.

44:19.255 --> 44:24.557
Between chartering the jet, and buying
the limo, and being totally ripped off,

44:25.194 --> 44:29.460
at least this experience
won't be a total loss.

44:31.701 --> 44:35.797
You keep this.
I did everything for you.

44:37.073 --> 44:41.669
Use it for the farm. Buy some grains,
some seeds, some tractors or something.

44:42.478 --> 44:44.002
It's yours.

44:47.049 --> 44:49.040
You've a big heart, Rick.

44:49.118 --> 44:50.278
So do you.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.147
Oh, sure.

44:52.488 --> 44:57.357
Yeah, about as cold as an
early morning frost in March.

44:59.095 --> 45:01.689
I nearly destroyed you.

45:02.231 --> 45:04.961
I'm real sorry, Rick.

45:05.168 --> 45:10.071
Jeannie, you came back.
That proves that you have a heart.

45:10.807 --> 45:15.710
Maybe, but I think
I can hear it breaking now.

45:16.646 --> 45:20.946
Wrong.
That's the sound of cannons.

45:23.085 --> 45:24.609
Bye.

45:25.721 --> 45:27.450
Bye.

45:31.127 --> 45:35.757
Jeannie. Wait. The money was for
the farm, but this is for you.

45:35.832 --> 45:37.390
I hope it's worth something.

45:37.466 --> 45:39.900
I'm sure it is.

46:19.275 --> 46:21.038
Hi, Thomas.

46:28.251 --> 46:30.242
You let her get away.

46:34.790 --> 46:38.282
Come on, let's go to the club.
See T.C. and Higgins.

46:47.303 --> 46:51.205
And raise a glass to
a beautiful friendship.
