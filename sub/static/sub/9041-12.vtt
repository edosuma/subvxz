WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.400
- HI, MARIE.
- OH, HI, DEAR.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.100
- LISTEN.
THANKS FOR WATCHING THE KIDS.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.333
I REALLY NEED TO GET
TO THE DENTIST.

00:07.333 --> 00:09.633
- I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL
THAT YOU TAKE ALL THIS TIME

00:09.633 --> 00:12.467
FOR YOURSELF.

00:12.467 --> 00:14.500
- THANK YOU.

00:14.500 --> 00:15.767
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON THERE?

00:15.767 --> 00:19.267
- OH, IT'S A BARONE FAMILY
CHRISTMAS LETTER.

00:19.267 --> 00:21.800
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE
UP-TO-DATE

00:21.800 --> 00:23.533
ON WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN DOING.

00:23.533 --> 00:25.500
- WELL, DON'T FORGET TO MENTION
MY NEW FILLING.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.100
[laughs]

00:27.100 --> 00:28.133
- MAYBE NEXT YEAR.

00:28.133 --> 00:29.367
THIS HAVE TO GO OUT
THIS AFTERNOON.

00:29.367 --> 00:30.400
I'LL GO ROUND UP THE KIDS.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.567
- OKAY.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.100
- [gasps]

00:43.100 --> 00:46.733
[gasps]

00:46.733 --> 00:52.267
OH, LADY, YOU ARE OUT OF
YOUR EVER-LOVIN' MIND.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.500
MARIE...

00:56.500 --> 00:58.600
- OH, MY GOD.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.067
OH, HONEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:00.067 --> 01:02.667
- YEAH, YEAH, I'M FINE.

01:02.667 --> 01:03.767
WAIT THE HELL ARE YOU--

01:03.767 --> 01:05.733
- OH, YOU SHOULD LOOK
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.300
LET ME GET YOU SOME ICE.

01:07.300 --> 01:10.067
- NO, MARIE, FORGET THE ICE.

01:10.067 --> 01:11.567
WHO ARE YOU SENDING THIS TO?

01:11.567 --> 01:13.333
- OH, YOU KNOW,
FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

01:13.333 --> 01:14.400
OH, HERE.

01:14.400 --> 01:19.267
PUT THIS BROCCOLI ON YOUR HEAD.

01:19.267 --> 01:21.367
- YOU CANNOT SEND THIS OUT.

01:21.367 --> 01:23.000
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.167
- "DEBRA'S COOKING
IS COMING ALONG.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.633
"SOMEDAY I MIGHT EVEN
CONSIDER HER FOR A JOB

01:28.633 --> 01:31.433
AT CHEZ MARIE."

01:31.433 --> 01:33.000
YOU'RE CONSIDERING ME

01:33.000 --> 01:35.300
FOR A JOB
IN YOUR RESTAURANT?

01:35.300 --> 01:40.367
- OH,
IT'S NOT A REAL RESTAURANT.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.333
IT'S MAKE-BELIEVE.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.600
- OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THIS?
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

01:44.600 --> 01:47.400
"DEBRA IS OUTNUMBERED
BY THE KIDS 3-TO-1,

01:47.400 --> 01:51.533
SO I'VE HAD TO HELP OUT,
SO NOW IT'S EVEN."

01:51.533 --> 01:54.600
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU ARE WORTH TWO OF ME.

01:54.600 --> 01:59.767
- OH,
NO ONE'S GOING TO DO THE MATH.

01:59.767 --> 02:02.333
I'M JUST SAYING IT'S NICE.

02:02.333 --> 02:03.767
- IT'S NOT NICE.

02:03.767 --> 02:07.200
IT'S YOU HAVING TO HELP POOR,
PATHETIC DEBRA.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.700
- AND ISN'T THAT NICE?

02:11.633 --> 02:13.600
- IT'S NOT TRUE.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.167
YOU ARE NOT
SENDING THIS OUT.

02:16.167 --> 02:17.467
- OH?

02:17.467 --> 02:19.767
I'M NOT?

02:19.767 --> 02:22.067
- NOT LIKE THIS.
NO WAY.

02:22.067 --> 02:25.167
- WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS IS MY LETTER,

02:25.167 --> 02:28.100
AND THIS IS AMERICA.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.267
- FINE.

02:32.267 --> 02:34.167
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:34.167 --> 02:35.667
FINE.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.367
GOOD-BYE, MARIE.

02:37.367 --> 02:40.300
- DEBRA--
- GOOD-BYE.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.600
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I FORGOT THE KIDS.

02:49.600 --> 02:53.033
YOU GONNA PUT THAT
IN YOUR LETTER?

02:56.467 --> 02:57.467
DEBRA...

02:57.467 --> 02:59.667
- OW.
- OH, OH, OH.

03:08.100 --> 03:11.033
- HEY, EIGHT MAIDS A-MILKIN'.

03:15.267 --> 03:19.567
- ARE WE GONNA DO THIS
EVERY NIGHT UNTIL CHRISTMAS?

03:19.567 --> 03:21.500
CAN'T WE JUST CUT
TO "PARTRIDGE IN A PEAR TREE"

03:21.500 --> 03:23.200
AND BE DONE WITH IT?

03:23.200 --> 03:25.500
- WOW.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.567
WHY DON'T WE GO TO MACY'S?

03:26.567 --> 03:30.700
YOU CAN PUNCH SANTA
AND KICK AN ELF.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.100
- SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.700
IT'S JUST THAT YOUR MOTHER
IS SENDING OUT

03:39.700 --> 03:41.600
THIS STUPID
FAMILY CHRISTMAS LETTER,

03:41.600 --> 03:43.400
AND I LOOK TERRIBLE
IN IT.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.300
SHE MAKES IT SOUND
AS IF SHE HAS TO RAISE MY KIDS

03:45.300 --> 03:46.400
AND CLEAN MY HOUSE

03:46.400 --> 03:50.367
WHILE I SIT AROUND
AND DROOL INTO A CUP.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.367
- JUST LET HER HAVE
HER DELUSIONS.

03:52.367 --> 03:53.700
WHAT ELSE DOES SHE HAVE?

03:53.700 --> 03:56.467
CHASING DAD AROUND THE HOUSE
WITH A CAN OF LYSOL?

04:02.400 --> 04:05.233
- YEAH, BUT SHE'S MAILING
THOSE DELUSIONS TO EVERYBODY.

04:05.233 --> 04:07.333
PEOPLE ARE GONNA THINK
IT'S TRUE.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.500
IT'LL BE, "THANK GOD
MARIE LIVES CLOSE ENOUGH

04:09.500 --> 04:14.033
TO HELP THAT IDIOT WOMAN
AND HER DIRTY FAMILY."

04:15.133 --> 04:17.433
- HELLO.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.333
I SAW YOU PULL IN, RAYMOND,

04:21.333 --> 04:23.433
AND I THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE SOME BISCOTTI.

04:23.433 --> 04:27.633
- OH, THANKS.

04:27.633 --> 04:28.967
BISCOTTI?

04:30.200 --> 04:31.800
- NO, THANK YOU.

04:31.800 --> 04:35.400
- ACTUALLY, I MADE THEM
FOR YOU, DEBRA.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.400
- OH, THAT'S NICE.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.567
IT'S NICE.

04:41.567 --> 04:45.200
- I'M SORRY, DEBRA.

04:45.200 --> 04:49.633
- OH, THAT'S SO NICE.
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

04:53.667 --> 04:56.067
- I'M SORRY THAT THAT LETTER
UPSET YOU SO.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.433
- NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

04:57.433 --> 04:59.233
YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

04:59.233 --> 05:01.000
- HAVE A BISCOTTI.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.233
- THANK YOU.
I WOULD LOVE ONE.

05:03.233 --> 05:06.367
- OH, I'M SO GLAD WE COULD
PUT THIS BEHIND US.

05:06.367 --> 05:09.167
- ME TOO; IT'S BEAUTIFUL
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

05:09.167 --> 05:12.067
- OKAY, I'VE GOT TO GET
THOSE LETTERS

05:12.067 --> 05:13.767
TO THE POST OFFICE
BEFORE THEY CLOSE.

05:13.767 --> 05:16.467
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

05:16.467 --> 05:18.267
YOU'RE STILL
SENDING THAT LETTER?

05:18.267 --> 05:20.267
- OH, OF COURSE, DEAR.
I HAVE TO.

05:20.267 --> 05:22.467
- YOU HAVE TO?

05:22.467 --> 05:24.667
MARIE, WHEN I SPEAK,

05:24.667 --> 05:28.233
WHAT IS IT YOU HEAR?

05:28.233 --> 05:33.167
IS IT, LIKE, BACKWARDS TALK
OR DOLPHIN SQUEAKS?

05:44.667 --> 05:45.667
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:45.667 --> 05:48.567
SEE, THIS IS THE REASON
I HAVE TO SEND MY LETTER.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.067
IT'S FROM MY COUSIN THERESA.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.067
IT CAME YESTERDAY.

05:51.067 --> 05:52.067
HERE, READ.

05:52.067 --> 05:54.433
- "MERRY CHRISTMAS
AND SEASON'S GREETINGS

05:54.433 --> 05:56.200
"TO OLD FRIENDS
AND NEW FRIENDS,

05:56.200 --> 05:57.267
DEAR FRIENDS
AND TRUE FRIENDS."

05:57.267 --> 06:00.600
- ENOUGH, ENOUGH.
I CAN'T ANYMORE.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.067
- I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED THERESA.

06:02.067 --> 06:05.533
- I LOVE HER,
BUT READ THIS HERE.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.000
"OUR CHOIR
SANG AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.433
MY ROSES WERE FEATURED
IN "GOOD HOUSEKEEPING."

06:10.433 --> 06:12.700
LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE
EXCLAMATION POINTS.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.200
YOU'D THINK THAT SHE PULLED
THE POPE OUT OF QUICKSAND

06:15.200 --> 06:19.167
OR SOMETHING.

06:19.167 --> 06:23.033
- SO YOU DON'T LIKE IT
THAT THERESA'S DOING WELL?

06:23.033 --> 06:25.067
- OH, IT'S NOT THAT.
YOU KNOW ME.

06:25.067 --> 06:27.333
I DON'T BOTHER
ABOUT PETTY JEALOUSY.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.133
- YEAH.

06:35.133 --> 06:38.533
THAT IS NOT YOUR STYLE.

06:38.533 --> 06:39.600
- THAT'S RIGHT.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.633
I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO READ
ABOUT ME AND THINK,

06:42.633 --> 06:44.433
"MARIE IS DOING WELL TOO."

06:44.433 --> 06:45.767
- YEAH, I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,

06:45.767 --> 06:47.733
BUT CAN'T YOU WRITE A LETTER
THAT MAKES YOU LOOK GOOD

06:47.733 --> 06:50.000
WITHOUT MAKING ME
LOOK SO...

06:50.000 --> 06:51.300
- DOOFUS-Y?

07:04.200 --> 07:06.500
- YEAH, DOOFUS-Y.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.433
- I GUESS I'M JUST
TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF

07:09.433 --> 07:11.733
SOUND AS IMPORTANT
AS THERESA.

07:11.733 --> 07:14.133
BUT WHAT AM I?

07:14.133 --> 07:16.500
I'VE GOT MY KIDS.
I'VE GOT MY GRANDKIDS.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.200
HIM OVER THERE.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.667
IT'S OKAY.

07:20.667 --> 07:22.033
I'LL JUST LET THE WORLD

07:22.033 --> 07:24.233
READ ABOUT ME
IN THERESA'S LETTER.

07:24.233 --> 07:26.033
- WHAT DID SHE WRITE
ABOUT YOU?

07:26.033 --> 07:29.567
- NOT MUCH.
HOW MUCH IS THERE, REALLY?

07:29.567 --> 07:31.000
- MARIE.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.200
- THIRD PAGE,
SECOND PARAGRAPH.

07:36.667 --> 07:40.100
- "WE SAW MARIE AND HER FAMILY
AT KATE KELLY'S WEDDING.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.333
"THEY ALL SEEMED TO BE
DOING WELL

07:41.333 --> 07:42.767
"IN THEIR COZY LITTLE SITUATION

07:42.767 --> 07:44.500
"LIVING A STONE'S THROW
FROM EACH OTHER,

07:44.500 --> 07:47.167
NOT THAT THEY'D EVER
THROW STONES, HA-HA."

07:47.167 --> 07:50.233
OH. SHE'S A BITCH.

07:54.267 --> 07:56.133
- LISTEN,
I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT,

07:56.133 --> 08:00.500
BUT IT'S NICE TO HEAR.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.333
- WELL, WAIT.
WHAT'S SO BAD?

08:03.333 --> 08:05.633
- "NOT THAT THEY'D EVER
THROW STONES, HA-HA"?

08:05.633 --> 08:07.633
SHE'S SAYING
WE DON'T GET ALONG.

08:07.633 --> 08:10.100
WHERE DOES SOMEBODY
GET OFF WRITING THAT?

08:16.233 --> 08:17.367
YOU KNOW WHAT, MARIE?

08:17.367 --> 08:19.200
YOU AND I ARE GONNA WRITE

08:19.200 --> 08:21.000
OUR OWN CHRISTMAS LETTER
TOGETHER.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.200
- OH, NO.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.200
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.267
- WE CAN WRITE A BETTER LETTER
THAN SAINT THERESA.

08:26.267 --> 08:28.200
WE'LL MAKE US BOTH
LOOK GOOD.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.700
MAYBE YOU CAN EVEN COME UP
WITH A LITTLE DIRT ON HER.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.067
- SHE DOES HAVE ECZEMA.

08:32.067 --> 08:35.267
- GREAT.

08:35.267 --> 08:37.533
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA
WRITE ABOUT ME?

08:37.533 --> 08:39.633
- WHAT ABOUT ALL YOUR TRIPS
TO THE BOTANICAL GARDENS, HUH?

08:39.633 --> 08:41.467
GET UP.
- WHAT?

08:41.467 --> 08:43.433
- OH.
WHAT ABOUT THE GARDENS?

08:43.433 --> 08:46.433
- WELL, YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT
PLACE THAN MOST OF THE GUIDES.

08:46.433 --> 08:48.767
"MARIE IS THE BEST GUIDE
AT THE BOTANICAL GARDENS."

08:48.767 --> 08:50.467
WE'LL PUT THAT RIGHT IN THERE.

08:50.467 --> 08:51.467
- WE WOULD?
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

08:51.467 --> 08:52.733
LET'S START RIGHT NOW.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.733
- OH, YES.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.433
THE SOONER WE WRITE IT,
THE SOONER WE CAN WIPE

08:55.433 --> 08:58.200
THAT SMUG GRIN OFF HER DRY,
ITCHY FACE.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.167
[laughter]

09:01.167 --> 09:03.033
- HEY, UH, EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

09:03.033 --> 09:05.033
LET'S NOT FORGET
IT'S CHRISTMAS, YOU KNOW,

09:05.033 --> 09:06.433
A TIME FOR NOT BEING SO...

09:06.433 --> 09:09.267
[witchy laughter]

09:12.600 --> 09:16.200
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT.

09:21.367 --> 09:22.667
- OKAY, THIS ALL LOOKS GREAT.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.133
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S JUST ONE THING.

09:24.133 --> 09:26.267
SHOULDN'T WE USE
THE WORD "SELFLESS"

09:26.267 --> 09:28.267
TO DESCRIBE YOUR WORK
AS A PIANO TEACHER?

09:30.467 --> 09:32.167
- OH, HI, ROBBIE.

09:32.167 --> 09:33.367
- HELLO.

09:33.367 --> 09:36.233
- HEY, ROBERT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:40.767 --> 09:44.367
- "ROBERT'S METEORIC RISE
THROUGH THE NYPD

09:44.367 --> 09:46.667
"HAS REALLY
TURNED SOME HEADS

09:46.667 --> 09:49.600
BOTH HERE AT HOME
AND AT THE PRECINCT."

09:49.600 --> 09:51.100
WHAT IS THIS?

09:51.100 --> 09:53.233
- I HEARD YOU WERE WRITING
A FAMILY CHRISTMAS LETTER,

09:53.233 --> 09:57.733
SO I DID MY BIO.

09:57.733 --> 10:00.400
I WOULD LIKE IT
INSERTED VERBATIM.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.467
- YOU WROTE YOUR OWN THING?

10:04.467 --> 10:06.767
- INDEED I DID.

10:06.767 --> 10:08.633
- WELL,
WE'VE ALREADY FINISHED IT.

10:08.633 --> 10:10.333
- YEAH.
- OH, REALLY?

10:10.333 --> 10:13.167
IS IT ANYTHING LIKE
YOUR LAST CHRISTMAS LETTER?

10:13.167 --> 10:15.100
- WELL, I HAVEN'T WRITTEN
A CHRISTMAS LETTER

10:15.100 --> 10:16.333
IN TEN YEARS.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.567
- LOOK FAMILIAR?

10:22.567 --> 10:24.600
- YOU KEPT THAT TEN YEARS?

10:24.600 --> 10:25.633
- OH, YES.

10:25.633 --> 10:28.167
I WASN'T EXACTLY PLEASED
WITH THE WAY I WAS PORTRAYED,

10:28.167 --> 10:32.133
AND I MADE A SOLEMN PLEDGE
TO NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.

10:32.133 --> 10:35.233
- DUDE, YOU ARE SO WEIRD.

10:35.233 --> 10:39.400
- AM I, RAYMOND?

10:39.400 --> 10:42.333
AM I?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.700
THERE WERE SIX LINES
IN YOUR SECTION.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.467
I GOT THREE.

10:51.467 --> 10:52.600
HALF, OKAY?

10:52.600 --> 10:53.600
AND AFTER IT CAME OUT,

10:53.600 --> 10:56.600
EVERYBODY GAVE ME, LIKE,
A PITIFUL, PATHETIC LOOK.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.333
- YOU ALWAYS GET THAT LOOK.

10:59.333 --> 11:02.633
- IT WAS MORE PRONOUNCED, MAN.

11:02.633 --> 11:04.700
- WELL, WE CAN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING NOW, ROBBIE.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.200
BUT DON'T WORRY.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.267
THERE'S A LOVELY PART
ABOUT YOU.

11:08.267 --> 11:11.300
- OH, YEAH?
LET ME SEE THAT.

11:11.300 --> 11:13.200
UH-HUH, UH-HUH,
OKAY, MM-HMM.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.400
ALL RIGHT, RAYMOND GETS ONE,
TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX,

11:16.400 --> 11:19.567
SEVEN LINES,
AND I GET ONE, TWO, THREE.

11:19.567 --> 11:23.200
THREE. LESS THAN HALF.
I'M LOSING GROUND.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.267
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU WROTE.

11:26.267 --> 11:29.000
"ROBERT IS
AN IN-DEMAND BACHELOR

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
HAPPILY PLAYING THE FIELD."

11:31.000 --> 11:34.333
- THAT'S RIGHT.

11:34.333 --> 11:35.600
- "ROBERT LOVES TO DANCE

11:35.600 --> 11:40.233
AND HAS BEEN KNOWN
TO BOOGIE THE NIGHT AWAY."

11:40.233 --> 11:41.667
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.333
YOU'VE BROADENED THE DEFINITION
OF THE TERM "BOOGIE"

11:44.333 --> 11:49.033
TO INCLUDE STAYING HOME
BY YOURSELF EATING WHEAT THINS?

11:49.033 --> 11:53.133
- I AM A DANCER.

11:53.133 --> 11:54.200
- WHAT'S THE--

11:54.200 --> 11:55.300
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
SO WORKED UP FOR?

11:55.300 --> 11:56.567
IT'S A CHRISTMAS LETTER.

11:56.567 --> 11:57.767
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

11:57.767 --> 11:58.800
- OH, YEAH, NOT FOR YOU.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.067
YOU'VE GOT
THE WHOLE RAYMOND FAN CLUB

12:00.067 --> 12:02.767
DOING YOUR WRITING.

12:02.767 --> 12:04.067
LET'S TAKE A GANDER

12:04.067 --> 12:07.033
AT THIS YEAR'S MODEL,
SHALL WE?

12:07.033 --> 12:11.233
[clears throat]

12:11.233 --> 12:14.067
"WHAT CAN YOU SAY
ABOUT RAYMOND?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.100
"WHETHER HE'S
PLAYING WITH THE CHILDREN

12:16.100 --> 12:20.367
OR PLAYING GOLF,
THE GUY LOVES LIFE."

12:20.367 --> 12:23.667
OH, HAPPY DAYS.

12:31.433 --> 12:32.733
"HE IS STILL
WRITING HIS COLUMN

12:32.733 --> 12:34.033
FOR NEW YORK 'NEWSDAY.'"

12:34.033 --> 12:36.433
- WHOA, WHOA.
WAIT A MINUTE.

12:36.433 --> 12:39.100
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"STILL WRITING MY COLUMN"?

12:39.100 --> 12:41.233
LIKE I SHOULD BE DOING
SOMETHING BETTER BY NOW?

12:41.233 --> 12:44.033
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT WE MEANT.

12:44.033 --> 12:45.233
- IT'S NOT "STILL WRITING."

12:45.233 --> 12:47.133
IT'S "STILL WRITING."

12:47.133 --> 12:49.700
- YEAH, WELL, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW
IT'S GONNA READ.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.800
PEOPLE ARE GONNA GET
THE WRONG IMPRESSION HERE.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.600
- OOH.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.367
- THIS IS GOING OUT
TO EVERYBODY THAT WE KNOW?

12:56.367 --> 12:58.133
- OF COURSE.
- NO, NOT LIKE THIS, IT ISN'T.

12:58.133 --> 12:59.800
- OH, RAY, COME ON.
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

12:59.800 --> 13:04.033
- I AM NOT OVERREACTING.

13:04.033 --> 13:08.233
- HEE HEE.

13:08.233 --> 13:10.000
- I COULD BE MANAGING EDITOR
OF THE SPORTS PAGE

13:10.000 --> 13:11.067
BY NOW IF I WANTED.

13:11.067 --> 13:13.100
I COULD WORK FOR THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" IF I WANTED.

13:13.100 --> 13:14.733
- WE KNOW THAT, RAYMOND.

13:14.733 --> 13:18.033
- BY THE WAY, WHY DIDN'T YOU GO
FOR THAT MANAGING EDITOR THING?

13:18.033 --> 13:19.767
- OH, SEE.
THERE IT IS.

13:19.767 --> 13:21.333
SEE, THE TRUTH COMES OUT.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.267
THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN BY "STILL".

13:23.267 --> 13:24.333
WE'RE CHANGING THIS LETTER.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.500
- NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE MEANT.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.467
- I'M GONNA WRITE
WHAT I WANT IN IT.

13:29.467 --> 13:32.467
- "MERRY CHRISTMAS, ROBERT."

13:37.533 --> 13:41.667
- HEY. HEY,
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.

13:41.667 --> 13:46.233
I'M HUNGRY.

13:46.233 --> 13:47.567
- YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

13:47.567 --> 13:50.100
DEBRA AND I HAVE TO FINISH
OUR CHRISTMAS LETTER.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.800
- YEAH, LOOK WHAT THEY WRITE
ABOUT YOU IN HERE, DAD.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.033
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT'S IT SAY?

13:54.033 --> 13:57.233
- YEAH, ALL THEY DO IS LIST
YOUR FAVORITE CABLE CHANNELS,

13:57.233 --> 13:58.533
AND THEN THEY SAY,

13:58.533 --> 14:02.000
"HIS LOVE AFFAIR
WITH BACON CONTINUES."

14:03.433 --> 14:05.500
- THE SURGERY CHANNEL
ON THERE, MARIE?

14:05.500 --> 14:06.633
- FIRST ON THE LIST.

14:06.633 --> 14:08.733
- I'M GOOD.

14:08.733 --> 14:10.367
- WELL, YEAH, WELL,
I'M NOT, OKAY?

14:10.367 --> 14:12.267
LOOK, YOU MAY NOT THINK
MY JOB IS SO HOT,

14:12.267 --> 14:15.800
BUT 600,000
DISCRIMINATING READERS DO.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.600
- SO YOU'VE BROADENED
THE DEFINITION

14:17.600 --> 14:19.300
OF THE WORD "DISCRIMINATING"

14:19.300 --> 14:21.533
TO INCLUDE PEOPLE
WHO DO THEIR READING

14:21.533 --> 14:24.633
WITH THEIR ELBOW
ON A ROLL OF TOILET PAPER?

14:31.467 --> 14:33.567
- HEY, AT LEAST I DON'T
SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE

14:33.567 --> 14:35.433
COMPETING
WITH MY LITTLE BROTHER.

14:35.433 --> 14:37.567
- OH, YEAH?
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, RAYMOND?

14:37.567 --> 14:38.567
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.067
I DON'T HAVE TO
COMPETE WITH YOU.

14:40.067 --> 14:42.533
- OH, YOU DON'T COMPETE?
THAT'S ALL YOU DO.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.033
- YEAH, SURE.

14:44.033 --> 14:46.333
- LOOK AT THIS.
YOU SAVED THIS FOR TEN YEARS.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.333
TEN YEARS.

14:52.167 --> 14:55.100
- OH, MY GOD.

14:58.567 --> 15:02.300
I SAVED THAT LETTER
FOR TEN YEARS.

15:02.300 --> 15:06.400
- OH, ROBERT,
THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.100
- IN A ZIPLOCK BAG.

15:11.367 --> 15:14.033
EVERYTHING I DO--
MY JOB, MY MARRIAGE,

15:14.033 --> 15:16.367
TRYING TO GET
MOM AND DAD'S ATTENTION...

15:16.367 --> 15:18.667
- LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.600
- ANYTIME SOMETHING GOOD
HAPPENS TO ME,

15:20.600 --> 15:23.700
THE FIRST THOUGHT I GET IS,
"HEY, WHAT ABOUT THAT, RAYMOND?"

15:23.700 --> 15:25.767
AND IF IT'S SOMETHING BAD,

15:25.767 --> 15:28.767
I ACTUALLY SAY A PRAYER
THAT RAY...

15:28.767 --> 15:31.100
DOESN'T DO SO GOOD THAT DAY.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.367
- YOU SAY A PRAYER?

15:33.367 --> 15:36.100
- "COME ON, GOD...

15:36.100 --> 15:39.033
GET HIM."

15:43.600 --> 15:46.100
- I REMEMBER THIS LETTER.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.633
I HAD ALL THE STUFF
I WAS GOING TO DO

15:47.633 --> 15:49.333
WHEN I RETIRE ON THIS.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.700
- WAS "BEING NICER
TO YOUR WIFE" ON THERE?

15:51.700 --> 15:56.300
- MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN.
IT'S ALL RIDICULOUS CRAP.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.800
"FIX UP A '57 CHEVY

15:57.800 --> 15:59.633
AND DRIVE IT
ACROSS THE COUNTRY."

15:59.633 --> 16:01.767
WHY WOULD I
WANT TO DO THAT?

16:01.767 --> 16:04.167
THAT'S WHERE CALIFORNIA IS.

16:04.167 --> 16:06.400
YOU ALL KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT CALIFORNIA...

16:06.400 --> 16:08.200
both: YES.
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.600
- A STATE FULL OF NUT JOBS,
HIPPIES, AND ARTSY-FARTSIES.

16:10.600 --> 16:15.300
DRIVE ACROSS COUNTRY?
I'D RATHER DRIVE OFF A CLIFF.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.167
- I'LL WARM UP THE CAR.

16:19.033 --> 16:21.400
- ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S WHAT IT SHOULD SAY.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.767
"RAY ENTERTAINS
AND INFORMS HIS READERS

16:23.767 --> 16:25.600
"WITH STORIES THAT USE SPORTS

16:25.600 --> 16:28.033
TO ILLUMINATE
THE HUMAN CONDITION."

16:28.033 --> 16:30.733
YOU HEARD ME.
"HUMAN CONDITION".

16:30.733 --> 16:32.633
- WRITE WHATEVER YOU WANT, RAY.

16:32.633 --> 16:35.767
IF YOU'RE HAPPY WHERE YOU ARE,
THEN SO AM I.

16:35.767 --> 16:38.367
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT IF YOU
WENT FOR THAT PROMOTION,

16:38.367 --> 16:39.367
YOU WOULD GET IT.

16:39.367 --> 16:42.267
- YEAH, WELL, WHAT IF THE JOB
I HAVE RIGHT NOW, HUH,

16:42.267 --> 16:43.267
WHAT IF THAT'S IT?

16:43.267 --> 16:45.067
- YEAH, THAT'S FINE. GREAT.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.200
BUT I JUST THINK THAT--

16:46.200 --> 16:47.633
- NO BUTS, ALL RIGHT?
DON'T BUT.

16:47.633 --> 16:48.667
- WHY ARE YOU GETTING
SO UPSET?

16:48.667 --> 16:51.700
- I ALREADY TRIED FOR THE STUPID
EDITOR THING, ALL RIGHT?

16:51.700 --> 16:53.033
TWICE.

16:53.033 --> 16:55.500
I DIDN'T GET IT...
TWICE.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.633
THERE, YOU HAPPY?

16:57.633 --> 17:00.633
- LITTLE BETTER.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.800
SORRY.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.733
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
SOMETHING BEFORE?

17:14.733 --> 17:18.633
- IT'S NOT EXACTLY SOMETHING
YOU COME HOME BRAGGING ABOUT.

17:18.633 --> 17:21.533
- SERIOUSLY, MAN,

17:21.533 --> 17:24.367
YOU CAN'T KEEP
ALL THAT STUFF BOTTLED UP.

17:28.533 --> 17:32.267
YOU HAVE TO SHARE IT
WITH US...

17:32.267 --> 17:37.133
WHEN YOU FAIL.

17:40.767 --> 17:42.100
- OH, SWEETIE.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.333
- OH, HONEY.

17:44.333 --> 17:45.600
HONEY...

17:45.600 --> 17:48.367
WHY DON'T YOU EVER TALK
TO ME ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS?

17:48.367 --> 17:50.267
I'M A GOOD LISTENER.

17:50.267 --> 17:52.667
- I'VE WASTED THE LAST
TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.267
- NOT NOW, FRANK.

17:54.267 --> 17:55.800
- I DIDN'T DO
ANY OF THE STUFF ON HERE.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.633
NONE OF IT.
NOW WHAT THE HELL AM I?

17:58.633 --> 18:00.267
JUST A LIST OF CABLE CHANNELS

18:00.267 --> 18:05.167
AND A BIG STINKING PILE
OF BACON WAITING TO DIE.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.367
- BIG DEAL.

18:06.367 --> 18:09.433
AT LEAST YOU WEREN'T COMPETING
WITH SOMEONE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

18:09.433 --> 18:10.800
YOU WERE YOUR OWN MAN.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.033
- "WERE YOUR OWN MAN"?

18:13.033 --> 18:14.467
PAST TENSE?

18:14.467 --> 18:16.733
YOU CAN'T WAIT, CAN YOU?

18:16.733 --> 18:18.133
- HEY, DON'T WORRY, DAD.

18:18.133 --> 18:19.267
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE,

18:19.267 --> 18:21.100
JUST LIKE
I'M "STILL" A WRITER.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.333
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
THIS KIND OF TALK.

18:22.333 --> 18:25.033
WE SHOULD ALL
BE COUNTING OUR BLESSINGS.

18:25.033 --> 18:26.133
- WHAT BLESSINGS?

18:26.133 --> 18:27.467
WHY DID YOU WRITE
A CHRISTMAS LETTER?

18:27.467 --> 18:28.767
LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

18:28.767 --> 18:32.200
- HEY, IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO DO
ALL THE THINGS ON THAT LIST.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.133
- "SEE FRANK SINATRA
IN CONCERT"?

18:38.567 --> 18:40.300
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
ENOUGH. HERE.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.600
MAKE A NEW LIST
AND START ON THAT.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.467
YOU CAN DO IT.
YOU'RE NOT DEAD YET, FRANK.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.633
AND, ROBERT, COME ON.

18:47.633 --> 18:49.467
YOU'RE SMART,
SUCCESSFUL, HANDSOME,

18:49.467 --> 18:51.433
NO MATTER WHAT RAY DOES
OR DOESN'T DO.

18:51.433 --> 18:53.033
YOU'RE NOT A LOSER.

18:53.033 --> 18:54.200
YOU'RE A LIEUTENANT

18:54.200 --> 18:57.000
IN THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE
DEPARTMENT FOR GOD'S SAKE.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.033
- YEAH, WHAT ABOUT ME?

18:58.033 --> 19:01.233
- YOU'RE FINE.
YOU'RE MARRIED TO ME, OKAY?

19:05.800 --> 19:08.233
ALL OF YOU.

19:08.233 --> 19:10.000
COME ON.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.733
- WHY'D YOU EVEN HAVE TO WRITE
THAT LETTER?

19:20.733 --> 19:23.100
IT'S THE LETTER
THAT MAKES US SOUND BAD.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.233
- GET RID OF THE LETTER.

19:24.233 --> 19:25.267
- YEAH, YEAH.
GET RID OF IT.

19:25.267 --> 19:26.800
- NO.
WE WORKED ALL AFTERNOON ON THIS.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.533
- IT'S OUR CHRISTMAS LETTER.

19:28.533 --> 19:30.000
- YEAH,
I WANT OUT OF IT.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.367
I FORBID YOU TO USE MY NAME
OR LIKENESS.

19:32.367 --> 19:34.067
- OH, FRANK, NO.
DON'T.

19:34.067 --> 19:36.567
- ME TOO. ME TOO.

19:36.567 --> 19:38.200
- NO, RAY, COME ON.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.467
- HEY, HEY, I'M NOT GONNA BE
THE ONLY LOSER IN THERE.

19:40.467 --> 19:43.400
I'M OUT TOO.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.333
- THIS IS CHRISTMAS.

19:57.333 --> 20:01.100
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SHARE
OUR JOYOUS NEWS OF FAMILY.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.667
- IT'S NOBODY'S DAMN BUSINESS.

20:02.667 --> 20:03.667
- DAMN STRAIGHT.

20:03.667 --> 20:04.667
- LET'S WATCH THE GAME.
- YEAH.

20:04.667 --> 20:08.500
- OH, COME ON, GUYS.

20:10.067 --> 20:11.400
- LOOK AT THIS.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.667
WE CAN'T SEND IT OUT
LIKE THIS.

20:13.667 --> 20:16.500
WHAT WILL PEOPLE THINK?

20:16.500 --> 20:21.500
IT'S JUST ME AND YOU NOW.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.700
HERE'S YOUR PART, DEAR.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.633
- I'VE GOT TO GET THIS
TO THE POST OFFICE.

20:25.633 --> 20:29.033
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP, DEAR.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.700
- ISN'T THIS NICE?

20:35.700 --> 20:37.800
CHRISTMAS MORNING,
AND WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.233
- YEAH, THIS IS NICE.

20:39.233 --> 20:40.533
- THIS IS WHAT
IT'S ALL ABOUT.

20:40.533 --> 20:42.233
- YEAH, READ ANOTHER ONE, DAD.

20:42.233 --> 20:43.367
- OKAY.

20:43.367 --> 20:47.667
THIS ONE IS FROM LINDA
AND DENNIS MCCARTHY.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.433
- OH, BOY.
- OH, THEY'RE THE WORST.

20:49.433 --> 20:51.500
- "DEAR FAMILY AND FRIENDS..."

20:51.500 --> 20:54.667
- WE'RE NEITHER.
KEEP GOING.

20:54.667 --> 20:56.300
- "IS IT CHRISTMAS ALREADY?

20:56.300 --> 20:58.200
"WITH OUR TRIP
TO COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG,

20:58.200 --> 20:59.700
"REMODELING THE LIVING ROOM,

20:59.700 --> 21:02.267
"AND DENNY'S SUCCESSFUL RUN

THE MONTHS HAVE JUST FLOWN BY."

21:06.300 --> 21:09.267
CITY COUNCIL OF WHAT CITY?
JACKASSVILLE?

21:09.267 --> 21:12.100
[laughter]

21:15.067 --> 21:17.100
- IS THERE A PICTURE WITH THAT?
LET ME SEE THE PICTURE.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.100
- HERE YOU GO.
- THEY ALWAYS SEND PICTURES.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.033

THAT LIVING ROOM

21:24.633 --> 21:29.400

[laughter]

21:46.600 --> 21:47.633
