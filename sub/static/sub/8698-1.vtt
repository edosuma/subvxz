02:39.400 --> 02:42.600
Okay, here goes.

02:44.070 --> 02:46.060
Okay, we're on.

02:47.360 --> 02:51.740
You're looking at a chair
because I'm sitting in it.

02:52.360 --> 02:56.530
My name is Nick Halloway.
I'm not sick, and I'm not crazy.

02:56.700 --> 03:01.200
But I am invisible.
How can I make you believe this?

03:02.830 --> 03:05.040
Okay, try this.

03:07.550 --> 03:09.620
See? No strings.

03:10.340 --> 03:14.550
Wait a minute.
This ought to do it for you.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.530
I'm making this tape because in hours,
I could be dead. This is my last chance.

03:34.700 --> 03:39.740
I've got a hell of a story to tell.
Let's get right to it.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.830
It all started on a Tuesday in March.

03:45.330 --> 03:47.240
Thirty-six inches packed powder?

03:47.590 --> 03:50.750
Can you get me in the Aspen Lodge
through Sunday?

03:50.920 --> 03:54.170
Just a single with a king-size bed.
You never know.

03:54.340 --> 03:57.010
Great. Thanks, Cheryl.
I'll get back to you.

03:57.180 --> 03:59.220
Boykin asked
if you saw the announcement...

03:59.390 --> 04:02.420
...of the proposed
Allied-Security oil merger.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.600
Kaplan called about Magnascopics.
You've got the OPEC thing.

04:06.770 --> 04:10.770
Staff meeting's Thursday. You haven't
begun that oil-shale analysis for Roger.

04:10.940 --> 04:13.650
- Shall I continue?
- What oil-shale analysis?

04:13.820 --> 04:17.269
- You are here.
- Roger. Come on in.

04:17.620 --> 04:21.779
I've been trying to get you all afternoon.
I've spent the day on this.

04:21.950 --> 04:26.120
I strongly recommend the company
examine oil-shale positions.

04:26.960 --> 04:31.620
Great. Well, everything else okay, huh?
Still going out with Denise Lee?

04:32.670 --> 04:35.040
Went out with her once.
Where you been, Rog?

04:35.300 --> 04:39.050
You are the biggest bullshit artist
I've ever worked for.

04:39.220 --> 04:42.970
Thank you, Cathy.
In fact, take the rest of the day off.

04:43.140 --> 04:45.630
- I'm going to my club.
- What?

04:45.850 --> 04:49.770
Magnascopics tomorrow.
A car will be at your apartment at 7:30.

04:49.940 --> 04:54.480
- You promised Kaplan you'd cover for him.
- How will I get through this? You go.

04:54.650 --> 04:57.320
- You gave him your word.
- I was drunk.

04:57.490 --> 04:59.980
- Get Moynihan to cover.
- You're committed.

05:00.160 --> 05:03.990
What about my commitments?
My family, my relatives?

05:04.160 --> 05:05.570
You don't have any.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.370
The day was panning out
like any other day in my life.

05:12.540 --> 05:16.920
But what was about to happen
was gonna change it forever.

05:17.680 --> 05:21.670
The Academy Club is one of the last
private men 's clubs in San Francisco.

05:21.850 --> 05:25.460
The place railroad tycoons
and robber barons would hang out...

05:25.640 --> 05:27.930
...eat roast beef,
hire the occasional whore...

05:28.100 --> 05:30.770
...and discuss how much
they stole that day.

05:30.940 --> 05:34.270
I use the tennis courts.
I like the bar.

05:36.030 --> 05:39.480
No. Bad shoulder.
No depth.

05:40.490 --> 05:43.440
Put me down for a dime
on St. John's/Villanova.

05:43.620 --> 05:45.820
I want the over on Duke/Carolina.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.320
All right. Thanks, Buzz.

05:48.910 --> 05:52.610
Somebody's trying to get your attention.
It's Mr. Talbot.

05:53.540 --> 05:56.580
Don't look, Patrick.
Just pretend you don't see.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.550
- Thanks, Patrick.
- Hi, Nick.

06:03.390 --> 06:05.710
Hi, George.
How's the spastic colon?

06:05.890 --> 06:08.840
- What you doing?
- Oh, writing my resignation.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.810
I'm gonna start a foster home
for poor kids.

06:11.980 --> 06:15.180
Girls, mostly. Late teens, early 30s.
I need a family.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.030
Yeah. Come join us.
I'm here with some of the gang.

06:18.190 --> 06:23.070
- No, I can't tonight.
- Come on. Come on, one drink, all right?

06:23.240 --> 06:25.230
It's just Ellen and some pals of hers.

06:25.410 --> 06:29.190
Alice Monroe, my sister Amy's friend
from Cornell, back from Brazil.

06:29.370 --> 06:33.780
- I've got an early morning. I can't...
- Before you bail, just have a look.

06:42.430 --> 06:44.420
Well, maybe for a minute.

06:45.550 --> 06:48.040
- You know everybody, don't you?
- Hi, Ellen.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.590
- Hi, Nick.
- Oh, Alice Monroe.

06:50.770 --> 06:53.600
I'd like you to meet Nick Halloway.
This is Alice.

06:53.770 --> 06:55.480
- Hi, Nick.
- Nice to meet you.

06:55.650 --> 06:58.650
- Where have you been hiding?
- Where have you been?

06:58.820 --> 07:01.310
- You got a haircut. Looks good.
- Like this?

07:01.490 --> 07:03.530
Alice produces
Smithsonian documentaries.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.940
Oh, really? I love the Smithsonian.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.780
It's one of my favorite institutions.

07:09.450 --> 07:12.290
So, what kind of documentaries
do you produce?

07:12.460 --> 07:16.120
Anthropological stuff, traditional cultures,
cosmologies.

07:16.290 --> 07:19.460
Cosmologies, love them.

07:19.630 --> 07:22.550
It's one of my favorite ologies.
Patrick.

07:22.970 --> 07:27.670
You went to law school, and you were
practicing in Boston. What happened?

07:27.840 --> 07:31.710
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer.
It just wasn't for me.

07:31.890 --> 07:36.390
- It'll be Indiana/UNLV. Maybe Arkansas.
- Carolina.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.100
The leap into film, what did you do?
Raise money?

07:39.270 --> 07:41.650
- Your firm represented someone?
- No, I quit.

07:41.820 --> 07:45.980
I got a job as a production assistant
for a public television station.

07:46.150 --> 07:49.990
- Next thing you know, I'm in the jungle.
- I think it's gonna be UNLV.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.320
Primitive, huh?

07:53.120 --> 07:57.870
There's only a few places in the Amazon
that could still be considered virgin.

08:00.170 --> 08:02.960
So, what did you miss most
when you were down there?

08:03.670 --> 08:05.790
Hot showers, cheeseburgers.

08:09.510 --> 08:12.080
I think Seton Hall will go all the way.

08:16.310 --> 08:19.680
- I hate TV.
- Me too.

08:19.980 --> 08:23.810
- I like music.
- I love jazz.

08:24.480 --> 08:28.950
- I hate weight lifters.
- Narcissists.

08:29.490 --> 08:35.860
- Love skiing.
- Love the ocean and the woods.

08:36.909 --> 08:39.289
I love blond hair.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.090
I love garlic.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.720
Nick.

08:55.390 --> 08:59.170
- What are we doing?
- I hope it's foreplay.

09:02.610 --> 09:06.560
- We should get back.
- Yeah. Yeah. We should get back.

09:08.820 --> 09:11.610
Let's not do anything
cheap and meaningless.

09:11.780 --> 09:13.740
Okay. What do I owe you?

09:15.080 --> 09:17.230
You couldn't afford it.

09:41.850 --> 09:43.680
- Ciao.
- Nice to have you back.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.260
- Thanks, George.
- See you soon.

09:46.440 --> 09:49.810
- Making an early night, Nick?
- I thought we were having dinner.

09:49.990 --> 09:53.850
- I promised I'd meet somebody.
- Really? Maybe I'd better drop you.

09:54.030 --> 09:58.330
Actually, dinner's not such a great idea
with all this work I gotta do.

10:00.370 --> 10:04.780
You like Italian? We could go to Fiorello's.
It's dark. It's quiet.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.880
I'd love to,
but I do have to meet somebody.

10:08.050 --> 10:09.420
You're kidding.

10:09.590 --> 10:12.620
- I thought you were putting them on.
- No.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.800
Want to meet for lunch Friday
at the Brasserie?

10:15.970 --> 10:18.290
Lunch? Let's go to Maui.

10:18.470 --> 10:21.050
Nick, we have plenty of time.

10:21.310 --> 10:23.100
You're right.

10:25.100 --> 10:29.020
- Am I gonna regret meeting you?
- You already do.

10:35.410 --> 10:37.780
In a way, it was all Alice's fault.

10:37.950 --> 10:41.950
Maybe if I hadn't met her that night,
and she hadn't been so beautiful...

10:42.410 --> 10:46.870
...I wouldn't have gone back to the bar
and drunk myself silly.

10:47.040 --> 10:51.250
The next morning, I was never
so hung-over in all my life.

10:56.890 --> 11:01.710
It is my pleasure to present the chairman
of our scientific advisory board...

11:01.890 --> 11:06.770
...and the Sidney Leavitt professor
of theoretical physics at Berkeley...

11:06.940 --> 11:09.340
...Dr. Bernard Wachs.

11:16.490 --> 11:19.860
Welcome.
Accustomed as we are today...

11:20.030 --> 11:25.620
...to think of magnetism as the vector of
spins and orbits of subatomic particles...

11:25.790 --> 11:30.200
...it is often with astonishment
that we discover how different men...

11:30.420 --> 11:33.540
...viewed the set of phenomena
that we group together...

11:33.710 --> 11:35.870
...under the term "magnetism."

11:36.170 --> 11:41.840
The Greek philosopher Thales,
as early as the sixth century B.C...

11:42.010 --> 11:48.220
...observed the extraordinary ability
of lodestones to attract other pieces...

11:52.940 --> 11:56.810
...returned to its original value.
A vector quantity that specifies...

11:56.990 --> 12:00.190
...direction and magnitude
of the force in our magnetic field...

12:00.360 --> 12:03.730
-...may temporarily convert the...
- Fifteen minutes in...

12:03.910 --> 12:09.660
...and we're not up to the birth of Christ?
Call me when he gets to the Inquisition.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.410
Excuse me.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.860
Excuse me.
Is there a men's room around here?

12:36.030 --> 12:38.860
Yes. Just down the hall there.

12:39.030 --> 12:41.570
- Oh, shoot!
- Thank you.

12:56.460 --> 12:57.660
Hello?

13:05.260 --> 13:06.290
Stay back.

13:24.950 --> 13:30.650
Ten minutes. Ten minutes.
I'll be as good as new.

13:32.330 --> 13:37.460
Von Erxlebren's design breakthrough
allowed an enhanced...

13:40.880 --> 13:41.880
What?

13:56.190 --> 13:59.190
Get out! Get out!
Run for it!

14:30.640 --> 14:34.470
Is it not true, Mr. Jenkins,
that you were in Honduras...

14:34.640 --> 14:37.810
...the same day Dr. Mendoza fell
to his death...

14:37.980 --> 14:41.060
...from the 21st floor
of the Hotel Presidente?

14:41.940 --> 14:44.780
Mr. Chairman, I was in Honduras
as a consultant...

14:44.940 --> 14:48.060
...to the Pan-American
Democratic Relief Organization.

14:49.070 --> 14:51.530
You're not paid by the CIA?

14:52.740 --> 14:55.700
You were never a station chief
code-named Scorpion?

14:55.870 --> 14:58.410
You weren't in Germany
two years ago...

14:58.580 --> 15:02.710
...when a defecting chief chemist
for IG Farben, a Dr. Hans Bodnik...

15:02.880 --> 15:07.870
...disappeared and later fell to his death
from the Hotel Continental in Würzburg?

15:09.180 --> 15:11.170
Would you repeat the question?

15:17.230 --> 15:19.430
How did those whores put me
in Würzburg?

15:19.600 --> 15:23.020
Don't worry about that.
We got a case-red priority.

15:23.190 --> 15:27.690
Something's happened at Magnascopics
in Santa Mira. We need you in California.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.770
- Read this.
- What is it?

15:29.950 --> 15:33.320
It's not what it is,
it's what it isn't.

15:34.870 --> 15:37.660
Come on. I'm not sure if...

15:39.040 --> 15:43.170
I don't know how long I was unconscious,
and I don't remember waking up.

15:43.340 --> 15:47.330
But when I did,
I was in a nightmare.

15:47.510 --> 15:49.960
Nothing around me was right.

15:50.180 --> 15:55.000
I could see pieces of the office,
Jagged edges of the building.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.710
Was I hallucinating?

15:57.930 --> 16:01.630
Because all laws of physics
seemed to have been suspended.

16:18.830 --> 16:20.950
Your attention, please.

16:22.170 --> 16:25.580
If you are entering the site,
use caution.

16:25.750 --> 16:29.040
While the building has the appearance
of being severely damaged...

16:29.210 --> 16:33.540
...we have found no debris.
No sign of a blast pattern.

16:33.720 --> 16:37.970
The building remains intact.
You just can't see certain parts of it.

16:38.140 --> 16:42.600
Possibly some molecular instability
has made certain areas transparent.

16:42.770 --> 16:48.060
Proceed carefully. You may come
in contact with invisible surfaces.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.600
Get some water to Decon!

16:55.780 --> 16:59.910
All personnel,
use caution entering the site.

17:00.080 --> 17:05.119
There are indications the building
may still be in flux.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.800
Everything inside me said,
"Get out."

17:17.970 --> 17:22.839
But when I moved,
I found myself floating in a dream.

17:23.020 --> 17:26.390
I walked across the room,
or what was left of it.

17:26.560 --> 17:31.640
I tried to re-orient myself.
What had happened?

17:32.070 --> 17:35.850
Had I died?
Was I a ghost?

17:50.960 --> 17:53.750
I had to think.
What was real and what wasn't?

17:54.210 --> 17:58.790
Where...? Where was my hand?
I couldn't see my hand. Oh, God

17:58.970 --> 18:00.930
What had happened to me?

18:02.430 --> 18:05.430
I needed help, but who?

18:06.390 --> 18:08.800
I had to call somebody.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.350
And then I knew.

18:14.110 --> 18:16.480
It wasn’t just the building.

18:17.450 --> 18:19.110
It was me.

18:20.780 --> 18:24.400
Jesus.
I walked over to the mirror.

18:24.580 --> 18:28.330
I was right. There was no reflection.
My body, clothes, everything was gone.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.570
I was invisible.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.510
I see it too.

18:57.990 --> 18:59.940
Throw some light up there.

19:05.950 --> 19:06.950
Hey!

19:09.500 --> 19:11.660
Hey, help me!

19:14.250 --> 19:15.250
Help!

19:16.920 --> 19:19.120
Help! Help!

19:19.340 --> 19:24.800
What's the matter with you? Help!
Jesus, can't you see me?

19:25.470 --> 19:30.470
You, help! Right here!
Right here!

19:33.600 --> 19:37.140
Help me!
Jesus, what have they done to me?

19:42.950 --> 19:45.240
- Maybe he's dead.
- No, he's breathing.

19:45.410 --> 19:48.160
I can see the blanket
moving up and down.

19:51.210 --> 19:54.080
What we could do
with this freak on our team.

19:54.250 --> 19:57.040
Talk about undercover.
The contracts we'd haul down.

19:57.210 --> 20:00.050
Forget it.
First place he's going is some lab.

20:00.210 --> 20:03.050
They'll be cutting him and shoving tubes
up his ass for years.

20:03.220 --> 20:06.830
- What?
- Keep your mouths shut. All of you.

20:07.010 --> 20:09.850
Wait a minute. Who are you guys?
What happened to me?

20:10.020 --> 20:12.010
Why can't I see myself?

20:12.310 --> 20:15.180
- Let's get him to the trailer fast.
- No!

20:16.810 --> 20:18.810
You stay back!

20:19.440 --> 20:23.570
I'm not going anywhere till I know
who you are and what's going on.

20:23.740 --> 20:28.570
I'm sorry. My name is David Jenkins.
May I know yours?

20:28.910 --> 20:30.310
Harvey.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.650
Well, Harvey...

20:33.830 --> 20:38.460
...I know the last few hours must have
been incredibly painful and disorienting.

20:38.630 --> 20:43.090
We need to get you medical attention,
a complete physical workup...

20:43.260 --> 20:45.830
I heard all about your physical workup.

20:46.010 --> 20:49.960
I'd just as soon not have my balls
floating in a petri dish, thank you.

20:50.140 --> 20:54.520
Don't panic. You've been through
an extraordinary trauma. You're confused.

20:54.680 --> 20:58.220
No shit! Hey, stop that!
Stop doing that!

21:00.520 --> 21:03.270
- I want to call my lawyer.
- Now, listen to me.

21:04.280 --> 21:08.230
You're in a state of molecular flux.
You could be dying.

21:08.410 --> 21:11.860
Now, if you wanna live,
you're gonna have to trust us.

21:12.370 --> 21:15.950
- We're a team of scientists...
- I don't believe you!

21:22.040 --> 21:24.450
Harvey, you have to understand...

21:24.630 --> 21:27.960
...I don't have the right
to let you leave here on your own.

21:28.130 --> 21:33.640
If something should go wrong, if anything
should happen to you, I'd be responsible.

21:34.390 --> 21:38.090
Some important decisions have to be
made about what's right for you...

21:38.270 --> 21:42.310
...and these decisions have to be made
by qualified people.

21:42.650 --> 21:45.270
I have to keep control
of the situation...

21:45.440 --> 21:49.820
...for your sake and for everyone's.
I think you can understand that.

21:52.780 --> 21:56.150
- Harvey?
- Yeah.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.740
Close the gates!
Seal the area!

22:15.770 --> 22:17.760
It's going! Take cover!

22:18.180 --> 22:20.430
- It's gonna blow!
- Don't look at it!

22:20.600 --> 22:22.800
Move! Move!

22:44.920 --> 22:47.870
I just kept running and running.
I must have run 10 miles.

22:48.050 --> 22:51.250
I have no idea.
I just wanted to get away from them.

22:53.970 --> 22:55.970
Hey! Help!

22:58.560 --> 23:01.840
By now I was in such a state of shock,
I was panicky.

23:02.020 --> 23:05.300
I couldn't remember anything,
couldn't remember what happened.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.890
I forgot I was invisible.

23:36.840 --> 23:38.880
I'll prove something to you.

23:46.440 --> 23:47.440
Okay?

23:48.230 --> 23:54.600
You didn't say something to my face,
so I got something to say to your face.

23:54.780 --> 23:55.780
I...

23:56.780 --> 24:00.950
You can't fire me.
Well, I'll fight you. You can't fire me.

24:01.120 --> 24:04.620
I'll fire you, so come on,
to my face, say it.

24:04.790 --> 24:08.950
So, what's up? Just say it to my face.
I'll get you two back.

24:09.130 --> 24:13.080
You can't fire me!
I'll fire you back!

24:14.970 --> 24:15.970
Taxi!

24:19.930 --> 24:22.930
Can you take me to San Francisco?

24:25.310 --> 24:26.310
Sure.

24:51.250 --> 24:54.250
I'm gonna need some money upfront.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.640
Here. Here you go.

25:11.690 --> 25:16.230
I'm gonna take a catnap. Can you wake
me up when we get to the bridge?

25:22.030 --> 25:26.910
The first thing I had to do was call
my doctor. No, no. That was stupid.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.990
How would an internist help me?
I needed a goddamn magician.

25:33.130 --> 25:36.160
Excuse me. Is this a cab?

25:37.880 --> 25:43.550
- Did you say something?
- Yes. Sacramento and Powell.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.680
Hey, could you pull over here?

26:22.590 --> 26:28.630
- Oh, God.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, God.

26:32.180 --> 26:33.980
Oh, baby.

26:36.150 --> 26:40.940
Driver, could you take me to San Rafael,
please? I changed my mind.

26:59.130 --> 27:03.000
I had to get into my apartment,
where I could study myself...

27:03.170 --> 27:05.380
...figure out what had happened.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.820
Maybe it would wear off in a couple
of days, but what if it didn't?

27:25.990 --> 27:28.860
What if I evaporated into nothing?

27:42.500 --> 27:45.790
He may have overheard something
that made him apprehensive.

27:46.180 --> 27:50.300
- The explosion might have frightened him.
- Anything could happen to him.

27:50.470 --> 27:52.460
He may be dead already.

27:52.640 --> 27:57.350
Well, I'm gonna have to take this up
with Parcells at Langley.

27:58.850 --> 28:01.340
I don't think you want to do that.

28:06.360 --> 28:09.780
- What do you mean?
- Show him the data. Give him anything...

28:09.950 --> 28:15.620
...but say nothing about the man.
Let's keep this private, huh?

28:16.540 --> 28:18.530
Now, think about it.

28:18.870 --> 28:23.500
You say one word, it becomes the deputy
director's show and not yours anymore.

28:23.670 --> 28:25.790
We're out of the loop.

28:26.460 --> 28:31.630
On the other hand, if we grab him quick,
we become his control.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.510
We're the only ones that know he exists.

28:34.680 --> 28:39.180
The single most exotic intelligence asset
on the planet is ours...

28:39.890 --> 28:41.890
...and ours alone.

28:42.230 --> 28:44.190
What do you need?

28:45.570 --> 28:49.730
...noon at an apartment in the 300 block
of South Jefferson in Daly City.

28:49.900 --> 28:54.070
The mother said she left her son
in Murphy's care for a few hours.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.650
Murphy lived in...

28:55.830 --> 28:59.410
Felt like I hadn't eaten in a week,
which is easier said than done...

28:59.580 --> 29:02.330
...when you can't even
see your own hands.

29:04.590 --> 29:09.580
Fire officials say the blaze
was caused by a faulty space heater...

29:09.760 --> 29:12.760
...in the second-floor apartment
on Diego Street.

29:12.930 --> 29:16.880
The single-family unit
was being shared by eight people.

29:17.060 --> 29:22.430
The heat had been turned off for
three weeks for failure to pay a gas bill.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.430
There was an accident today
at the Magnascopics Laboratory.

29:26.610 --> 29:29.280
A spokesman
for the nuclear regulatory agency says:

29:29.440 --> 29:33.690
"Although the laboratory was the site
of nuclear-fusion research...

29:33.870 --> 29:38.080
...there was no radioactive material
and no risk of contamination."

29:38.240 --> 29:40.740
- No injuries were reported.
- Bullshit.

29:40.910 --> 29:44.990
Authorities are keeping the area
cordoned off as a precaution.

29:45.170 --> 29:47.790
An Oregon man
is being arraigned today...

29:47.960 --> 29:51.130
...on charges he killed a man
nine years ago...

29:51.300 --> 29:53.300
Oh, Jesus.

30:12.740 --> 30:15.940
- What happened?
- Where have you been?

30:16.120 --> 30:19.230
For a moment,
I thought it had all been a dream.

30:19.410 --> 30:21.200
But that didn't last.

30:21.370 --> 30:25.150
I saw the news about the fire
at Magnascopics and I was worried.

30:25.330 --> 30:28.450
The food I hadn't thrown up
the night before had evaporated.

30:28.630 --> 30:30.250
I was as transparent as ever.

30:30.420 --> 30:33.750
- Oh, shit.
- Nick. Nick.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.720
I'm here.

30:37.300 --> 30:39.760
- Sort of.
- So, what happened out there?

30:41.180 --> 30:45.180
Cathy, I've been sick as a dog.
What's this about a fire?

30:45.350 --> 30:50.510
You didn't go, then? You're sick? Well,
I'm sorry. Can I send you some soup?

30:50.690 --> 30:55.980
No. No. No. I'll be fine. Just reschedule
all my appointments for Monday.

30:56.150 --> 30:58.860
- Thanks, Cathy. Bye.
- Bye.

31:00.530 --> 31:02.690
It's Roger. Where are you?

31:02.870 --> 31:06.570
Should we be long or short on Allied?
The stock is going crazy.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.410
Would you call me, please?

31:12.630 --> 31:14.840
Hi, Nick. It's Alice.

31:15.010 --> 31:20.380
I'm calling to confirm our lunch on Friday.
Am I being too forward about this?

31:20.550 --> 31:24.600
What am I talking about? We've already
been to the ladies ' room together.

31:24.770 --> 31:25.930
See you Friday.

31:28.980 --> 31:33.520
Nick. David Jenkins. Global Devices.
Perhaps we met last night.

31:33.690 --> 31:36.940
We got your name from the register.
There will be an inquiry...

31:37.110 --> 31:41.060
...into what happened at Magnascopics
last night. We'll need a signed statement...

31:42.160 --> 31:45.740
I knew that voice.
Who the hell did he think he was kidding?

31:45.910 --> 31:47.870
These guys were fast.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.410
Robin, it's Nick Halloway.
It's important.

31:50.580 --> 31:54.450
Mr. Cebron 's in court today,
but I know he wants to talk to you.

31:54.630 --> 31:58.410
- He does?
- Are you in trouble with the government?

31:58.590 --> 32:01.710
- Why would I be?
- That's what Mr. Cebron asked...

32:01.890 --> 32:05.090
...but they were being real vague.
Oh, can you hold on?

32:08.850 --> 32:10.760
Robin, they're paging my flight.

32:10.940 --> 32:14.190
- Tell him I'll call him when I get to Dallas.
- Dallas?

32:15.820 --> 32:20.520
Who the hell were these guys?
How did they find me so quickly?

32:22.360 --> 32:25.370
I had to get out of there fast.

32:25.540 --> 32:29.610
The first thing I had to do was remember
where I put my jacket and shoes.

33:04.820 --> 33:08.490
Keep that thing low so when I mark him,
you don't get off a headshot.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.070
We're at the front door.

33:16.130 --> 33:17.830
Zebra Team standing by.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.410
- Alpha?
- Ready.

33:19.590 --> 33:20.870
- Delta?
- In place.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.460
- Baker Team?
- Set up.

33:23.630 --> 33:26.340
- You've got a green light.
- Let's take this asshole.

34:10.389 --> 34:13.840
- This is Jenkins. I'm at the front door.
- Shit.

34:14.020 --> 34:16.550
- Give me the status on the roof.
- No movement yet.

34:19.060 --> 34:21.600
Come on, come on, come on.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.489
- Is it all right to open up?
- Yes, ma'am.

34:35.659 --> 34:38.150
May I come in to use
the phone, please?

34:40.580 --> 34:45.380
He seemed such a nice young man,
that Mr. Halloway. Has he killed someone?

34:51.719 --> 34:53.760
Oh, I must have slipped.

35:01.190 --> 35:02.650
Halloway!

35:07.990 --> 35:09.530
I got him.

35:19.580 --> 35:20.610
Oh, shit.

35:20.790 --> 35:22.620
California Street.

35:30.470 --> 35:32.960
Mr. McCaren, you all right, sir?

35:33.140 --> 35:36.800
- What happened?
- I think something hit me.

35:36.970 --> 35:40.220
- What was it? You sure you're okay?
- My back.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.260
Who are you guys?

35:54.160 --> 35:56.230
Halloway, are you there?

35:59.200 --> 36:03.700
If you're hurt,
I'd like to help you.

36:06.500 --> 36:10.960
Halloway, listen to me.
You can't escape.

36:12.180 --> 36:17.680
Believe me. Wherever you go,
whoever you tell, it all comes back to me.

36:19.430 --> 36:24.770
You must trust us, Nick. We're the only
people that can give you your life back.

36:24.940 --> 36:26.350
We're all you have.

36:29.940 --> 36:34.400
It's lonely, isn't it, Nick?
When you're a freak?

36:34.570 --> 36:35.770
Fuck you.

36:46.380 --> 36:48.750
For hours,
I wandered the streets of the city.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.380
I was a fugitive,
afraid of getting caught.

36:51.550 --> 36:55.210
I kept imagining Jenkins leaping out
at me from every dark corner.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.010
Taxi!

37:09.230 --> 37:14.140
As a child, when I'd dream about being
invisible, I thought it would be so easy.

37:14.320 --> 37:19.060
I could do what I want,
go where I want and take what I want.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.280
But that's the catch.

37:21.450 --> 37:25.530
No matter how hungry I was,
I couldn't give myself away.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.040
My purse! My purse!

37:42.350 --> 37:44.170
I was starving and exhausted.

37:44.350 --> 37:47.390
Somehow, I found myself
in the alley behind my club...

37:47.560 --> 37:50.480
...and I figured it would do
for the time being.

37:52.480 --> 37:56.270
In a building this size,
there would be places to hide.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.810
Finally, I formulated a plan.

38:01.450 --> 38:03.740
I'd get to this Dr. Wachs
from Magnascopics...

38:03.910 --> 38:05.370
...show him what had happened.

38:05.540 --> 38:10.250
And whatever he did to get me this way,
I would demand he undo.

38:33.900 --> 38:36.900
Wachs?
Magnascopics doctor?

38:37.070 --> 38:39.860
Last Wednesday?
I was inside when it happened.

38:40.030 --> 38:43.860
- I beg your pardon?
- Give me a dollar. They could be watching.

38:44.570 --> 38:47.330
Does the word "invisible"
mean anything to you?

38:52.960 --> 38:57.420
- Where's the professor?
- In the park, taking a stroll.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.800
- Come on, will you? We're gonna lose him.
- Relax.

39:09.230 --> 39:14.520
But this is astounding.
I never dreamed. They never told me.

39:14.690 --> 39:16.430
Open your coat,
show me the rest.

39:16.610 --> 39:19.520
- Trust me. It's all the same.
- Oh, dear God.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.180
There's got to be
another psychotron, right?

39:22.360 --> 39:24.690
Can't you just take me there
and turn me back?

39:24.870 --> 39:29.360
I'll forget the whole thing. No lawsuits,
no recriminations. No harm, no foul.

39:29.540 --> 39:34.330
Our research had nothing to do with
invisibility. This was a random reaction.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.710
- Don't say this.
- What are you doing here?

39:36.880 --> 39:39.080
You should be with me,
with us, in the lab.

39:39.250 --> 39:43.090
We must replicate the variables,
begin to explore how this happened.

39:43.260 --> 39:46.430
"Begin to explore"?
That's not good enough!

39:46.600 --> 39:49.470
- You gotta help me now!
- It's gonna take time.

39:49.640 --> 39:53.890
I don't have time! I want
my molecules back! Look at me!

39:54.060 --> 39:55.560
It's him.

40:00.030 --> 40:01.600
- You gotta turn me back.
- No!

40:03.740 --> 40:05.810
Oh, God. You bastards!

40:38.060 --> 40:39.060
Shit!

40:49.110 --> 40:52.730
Would you bring me a phone,
please? Thanks.

40:56.870 --> 40:59.450
Hi, this is Alice Monroe.
I'm meeting Nick...

40:59.630 --> 41:02.300
...for lunch at the Brasserie.
Is he on his way?

41:02.460 --> 41:05.170
I don't have you in his book
or I would have phoned.

41:05.340 --> 41:08.380
Mr. Halloway's out sick.

41:09.890 --> 41:12.460
- I hope it's nothing serious.
- No, it's the flu.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.930
I'll tell him you called.
What's your number?

41:15.810 --> 41:20.300
Yeah. It's Alice Monroe.
555-9290.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.510
- Sure.
- Thanks.

41:21.690 --> 41:23.480
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:25.650 --> 41:30.560
I guess I'll be eating alone.
Can I see a menu, please? Thanks.

41:32.660 --> 41:36.660
I am the Sidney Leavitt professor
of theoretical physics, a member...

41:36.830 --> 41:40.500
-...of the National Academy of Science!
- Shut up!

41:40.670 --> 41:45.160
- I'll ask again. Where is he?
- I've already told you, I don't know.

41:45.340 --> 41:47.830
Why didn't somebody tell me
there was a man inside?

41:48.010 --> 41:51.010
When are you planning to make
contact with him again?

41:51.180 --> 41:53.850
Exactly under whose authority
are you operating?

41:54.010 --> 41:57.630
I know the deputy director,
and Dick Parcells would never sanction...

41:57.810 --> 42:01.640
...that stunt your goons pulled in the park
this afternoon.

42:02.560 --> 42:07.980
Now, Dr. Wachs, what were you
really doing at Magnascopics?

42:08.150 --> 42:11.690
I find it hard to believe
that this was all simply an accident.

42:11.860 --> 42:13.860
I am aghast at this.

42:14.030 --> 42:17.530
There's an invisible man loose in the city.
I want to find him too...

42:17.700 --> 42:19.950
...so, what are we doing here?

42:24.540 --> 42:28.590
- Take off your jacket.
- Why? What are you gonna do?

42:28.760 --> 42:32.370
Don't worry, doc.
This won't hurt you a bit.

42:32.550 --> 42:35.340
Make a fist.
I said, make a fist.

42:35.510 --> 42:38.600
- Let me know when he's ready.
- Why are you doing this to me?

42:38.770 --> 42:43.390
- All I know is that he exists.
- And that's already too much.

42:44.270 --> 42:47.770
"Never been married,
parents both deceased."

42:47.940 --> 42:51.720
The guy's got a few friends,
but not real close to any of them.

42:51.900 --> 42:57.060
Not exactly a workaholic either.
He kind of plays it fast and loose.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.820
It's always difficult
with people like this.

42:59.990 --> 43:05.070
No strong emotional ties,
no political beliefs, no particular interests.

43:06.250 --> 43:09.700
As a matter of fact,
when you think about it...

43:09.880 --> 43:15.170
...the man has the perfect profile.
He was invisible before he was invisible.

43:15.340 --> 43:21.760
Look, he's not a pro. He's alone.
He's desperate. He'll crack.

43:24.770 --> 43:27.310
Where are you hiding, Halloway?

43:52.800 --> 43:55.210
I could only sleep
out of sheer exhaustion.

43:55.380 --> 43:58.420
And when I did sleep, I would dream.
Weird, crazy dreams...

43:58.590 --> 44:02.640
...about what might have been
and what I had lost.

44:02.810 --> 44:04.720
Welcome, Nick.

44:07.770 --> 44:10.850
- Oh, Nick. Hi.
- Hello, Nick.

44:11.020 --> 44:13.770
Nick, good to see you.
Good to see you.

44:13.940 --> 44:15.690
Hi, Nick.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.700
Hi, Nick.

44:20.280 --> 44:23.650
- Nick, you charmer.
- Right this way.

45:17.590 --> 45:19.210
Looking for something, Nick?

45:34.400 --> 45:38.890
It was about time I did look for something.
Maybe I could turn the tables on them.

45:39.070 --> 45:42.980
Find out what they knew about
my condition and use it to my advantage.

46:09.680 --> 46:11.920
- Who's up?
- Vinny's up. Sit down and deal.

46:12.100 --> 46:14.770
Yeah. I owe the pot $2.

46:16.610 --> 46:18.930
Red dog, red dog,
face of red dog.

46:19.110 --> 46:22.440
Nothing is wild, and it starts with Vin.
Six dollars in the pot.

46:24.450 --> 46:26.270
Pass? No pass?

47:10.030 --> 47:13.620
Congressman Davis called
for a third time.

47:14.660 --> 47:18.660
Singleton called from L.A. looking
for Wachs. I said what you told me to.

47:18.830 --> 47:20.960
If we can't find this dude
for six months...

47:21.130 --> 47:24.250
...is he gonna keep us
operational that long?

47:24.420 --> 47:29.380
Singleton's weak and he's unreliable,
but he knows the value of the prize.

47:29.550 --> 47:32.390
So let's start
with surveillance reports.

47:32.560 --> 47:35.310
- Comments?
- Okay, phone calls...

48:30.670 --> 48:32.130
Welcome.

48:37.430 --> 48:41.470
I often sit here like this
at the end of the day, in darkness...

48:41.640 --> 48:46.600
...and imagine what it must be like.
Were you conscious when it happened?

48:47.610 --> 48:53.110
Did you feel yourself change?
Did you pray?

48:56.110 --> 49:00.440
I've been worried about you, Nick.
Is everything all right?

49:06.420 --> 49:08.790
How long have you been here?

49:09.460 --> 49:14.370
Long enough to learn things about you
I might tell my friends at the Chronicle.

49:17.130 --> 49:20.050
You don't have any friends
at the Chronicle, Nick.

49:21.010 --> 49:23.800
Besides, we both know that
when you go to the press...

49:23.970 --> 49:26.550
...you become the last thing
you want to be:

49:26.730 --> 49:28.640
A circus attraction.

49:28.810 --> 49:31.600
- Now, I told you. It all comes back to me.
- Bullshit.

49:33.230 --> 49:35.850
You answer to people.
I heard.

49:36.030 --> 49:39.810
Maybe I'll call Washington
and talk to a guy named Singleton.

49:40.570 --> 49:41.990
Let's say you do.

49:42.160 --> 49:47.120
What do you think you could control the
moment you make your presence known?

49:47.960 --> 49:52.170
And if I work with you,
I suppose things would be different.

49:52.340 --> 49:56.630
I could come and go as I please.
Put your goddamn hands on the desk!

49:58.720 --> 50:04.390
Now get a grip on yourself, Nick.
Listen to what we're offering you.

50:04.560 --> 50:09.680
- In exchange for what?
- For your services to your country.

50:10.400 --> 50:15.470
You have a wider obligation now.
You can be of immeasurable value to us.

50:17.610 --> 50:19.480
I'm not doing your spying.

50:20.280 --> 50:24.910
Suppose we'd had you,
an invisible agent, in 1939.

50:25.080 --> 50:28.200
Maybe there wouldn't
have been a Second World War.

50:28.370 --> 50:32.040
What are you saying? You mean
I would have killed Hitler for you?

50:32.210 --> 50:38.380
I mean maybe you could have saved
30 million lives. Changed history.

50:38.550 --> 50:44.500
Now, assassination, anything at all, is
entirely ethical if you're on the right side.

50:51.730 --> 50:54.480
Now you listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

50:54.650 --> 50:58.400
I've lost everything but my soul,
and you won't take that away from me.

50:58.570 --> 51:02.570
Whatever I become, it'll be my choice,
not yours. Is that clear?

51:02.740 --> 51:06.240
We're prepared to give you
anything you want, everything you need.

51:06.410 --> 51:12.910
But you have to understand, if you
won't work with us, I can't let you live.

51:14.420 --> 51:18.410
I don't sleep well. I can see through
my eyelids, through the top of my head.

51:18.590 --> 51:20.410
I get walleyed!
I get bat-shit!

51:26.220 --> 51:28.710
Don't you ever touch me again.

51:36.770 --> 51:38.730
I'll kill him. I swear to God.

51:40.740 --> 51:44.430
- Back off.
- Do what he says.

51:46.820 --> 51:48.280
Move it.

51:55.620 --> 51:56.620
Nick.

51:57.710 --> 52:03.250
Contrary to what you might think,
I am not without feelings.

52:05.340 --> 52:09.260
Oh, God. Don't you see, we're
in this together, Nick, you and l?

52:09.430 --> 52:12.930
We're not so terribly different.
We're iconoclasts.

52:14.430 --> 52:16.840
Think of the adventure
we could have together.

52:17.020 --> 52:19.810
Yeah, we can go to Frontierland.

52:26.570 --> 52:29.490
- See you, Dave.
- Oh, Nick...

52:39.000 --> 52:40.460
Give me that.

52:49.760 --> 52:51.840
I had to get out of San Francisco.

52:52.010 --> 52:55.850
Jenkins would never stop searching,
and I wasn't safe at the Academy Club.

52:56.020 --> 53:00.020
He knew my patterns. It'd only be a
matter of time before he'd catch me there.

53:00.190 --> 53:02.890
There were hotels,
but they would be more dangerous.

53:03.070 --> 53:07.530
I couldn't go back to my apartment,
and I couldn't risk confiding in anyone.

53:08.780 --> 53:11.860
That's when I decided
on George's summerhouse.

53:13.370 --> 53:17.740
Three quarts of vodka, 3 quarts of
Scotch. Do you have any bouillon cubes?

53:17.910 --> 53:22.330
Yeah, for soup or broth.
You know, chicken, beef, vegetable.

53:22.840 --> 53:28.540
Well, which is clearest? Clearest.
Which is most transparent?

53:28.720 --> 53:32.840
I'm looking for clear foods here.
No coloring. Easy to digest.

53:33.010 --> 53:36.380
My doctor says I gotta eat
clear foods. I'm all gas.

53:36.850 --> 53:39.550
Hold on a minute, will you?
What's that, George?

53:41.730 --> 53:46.390
Mr. Talbot says, could you please charge it
to his account? 37 Beachfront Lane.

53:46.570 --> 53:50.610
Thank you very much. Yeah,
tell the kid to come in the front door.

53:52.570 --> 53:54.570
Anybody home?

54:28.780 --> 54:29.980
Hello?

54:49.840 --> 54:51.300
Hey, dickwad.

54:59.970 --> 55:02.430
I had to put the old Nick Halloway
behind me.

55:05.350 --> 55:08.060
I'd create a new identity,
go underground.

55:08.650 --> 55:09.890
- Morning.
- Morning.

55:10.070 --> 55:13.650
Get myself a secure place
where Jenkins would never find me.

55:15.110 --> 55:16.820
I could play the market
by phone.

55:16.990 --> 55:21.620
All I needed was a name on a brokerage
account and a few bucks to start with.

55:21.790 --> 55:24.870
I would become the invisible tycoon,
and then...

55:25.040 --> 55:27.120
Then I would make them pay.
All of them.

55:27.290 --> 55:31.540
They would rue the day
they tangled with Nick Halloway.

55:44.520 --> 55:46.180
Wow, George. It's beautiful.

55:46.350 --> 55:48.510
Yeah. Everybody needs a place
to get away.

55:48.690 --> 55:51.610
- Recharge the batteries.
- If you can get here.

55:51.770 --> 55:55.270
- We got here, didn't we?
- Yeah, we did, but that traffic...

55:55.650 --> 55:57.280
Now half the day is gone.

56:01.910 --> 56:03.870
Get in. We'll drive
back to the city.

56:05.790 --> 56:07.860
Shit, George.
What are you doing here?

56:08.040 --> 56:11.710
- Just forget it. We're here, all right?
- That's what I said.

56:11.880 --> 56:16.710
God! The silence.
And the air out here.

56:17.550 --> 56:20.630
It makes me think of children
and the Fourth of July.

56:20.800 --> 56:24.390
I like it better in the wintertime.
It gets so crowded in the summer.

56:24.560 --> 56:29.180
This is the first chance I've had to relax
since I've been back. Thanks, George.

56:29.350 --> 56:32.220
It's so stuffy in here.

56:33.480 --> 56:36.350
It smells like somebody had a fire.

56:42.490 --> 56:45.990
- Subletting to someone?
- What the hell is going on?

56:46.160 --> 56:51.160
- I haven't been here since January.
- I think we should have a look around.

56:52.580 --> 56:54.830
Is there a gun in the house?

57:11.940 --> 57:14.140
Goddamn it!

57:16.610 --> 57:18.930
Somebody's been
wearing my clothes!

57:20.700 --> 57:23.480
- This is certainly peculiar.
- What?

57:23.660 --> 57:27.740
Everything's here, my hidden key
is missing, and the jacuzzi's on the timer.

57:27.910 --> 57:31.610
All right, I don't like this.
This is making me very nervous.

57:31.790 --> 57:34.250
Whoever it is,
they left you fully stocked.

57:34.540 --> 57:36.780
Someone put food
in my refrigerator?

57:37.170 --> 57:40.830
There's some nice stuff in here.
There's a bottle of Montrachet.

57:41.010 --> 57:44.630
That's why I love Marin County.
You get a better class of burglar.

57:44.800 --> 57:48.630
It's gotta be my brother Chuck.
He must have split up with Kathleen again.

57:48.810 --> 57:50.510
Oh, great.

57:50.680 --> 57:53.970
Wyborowa, 100 proof.
Chuck drink this?

57:54.400 --> 57:55.400
No.

57:58.320 --> 58:00.940
But I know who does.

58:02.650 --> 58:04.610
Halloway's in trouble.

58:04.780 --> 58:08.690
I spoke to a pencil pusher at some
government agency I never heard of.

58:08.870 --> 58:11.660
He asked me the same
personal questions about Nick...

58:11.830 --> 58:15.080
...the SEC did when
Charlie Randolph got busted.

58:15.250 --> 58:17.790
There's a lot of confusion over
at Shipway & Whitman.

58:17.960 --> 58:21.330
When a guy's been working there
10 years, suddenly disappears...

58:21.510 --> 58:25.010
Roger Whitman's got auditors
looking to see if anything's missing.

58:25.430 --> 58:29.260
Do you really think he's a thief?
Didn't strike me as the embezzler type.

58:29.430 --> 58:33.810
Knowing Nick, he probably came here
to shack up with somebody's wife.

58:37.860 --> 58:42.270
- If that's all it was, he'd have called me.
- Why don't we just change the subject?

58:42.440 --> 58:46.280
Wherever he is, I'm sure Nick would love
to know we're talking about him.

58:46.450 --> 58:48.520
I think Halloway got
in a lot of trouble...

58:48.700 --> 58:53.030
...came out here, got nice and loaded
and walked into the ocean one day.

58:53.290 --> 58:57.120
Oh, come on. Nick's way too narcissistic
to kill himself.

58:57.370 --> 59:01.540
He'll probably wash up on the shore
one day all bloated and eaten by crabs.

59:01.710 --> 59:03.310
Richard!

59:04.420 --> 59:07.870
How can you say these things?
I thought you were Nick's friends.

59:08.050 --> 59:10.090
It's just...
I don't know.

59:10.260 --> 59:13.510
I got a real funny vibe,
like he's dead.

59:14.390 --> 59:16.880
Well, why don't you have
a séance, Richard.

59:17.060 --> 59:23.020
Get out your Ouija board and call up
his spirit from the dead. I'm going to bed.

59:24.990 --> 59:26.610
George...

59:26.780 --> 59:29.860
Seems to me, if he was gonna
commit suicide in my house...

59:30.030 --> 59:34.240
...he'd have the common decency to leave
a note or clean up a little first.

59:34.410 --> 59:38.580
Laugh, but I'd be careful mocking
what you don't understand.

59:38.750 --> 59:44.700
Nick! Nick! If you're here with us,
Nick, give us a sign.

59:48.340 --> 59:50.550
Jesus! You bastard!

59:51.640 --> 59:53.880
He could have been channeling
through me!

59:56.310 --> 59:57.310
Shit!

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.510
Losing weight, Richard?

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:14.660
- So much for my good friends.
- Ellen, you wanna get the lights, please?

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:19.620
- Night.
- Good night, you two.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.370
- Well, I'm not really that tired, are you?
- Yeah. I'm exhausted.

01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:30.630
Yeah, me too. Meet you on the beach
for a swim, bright and early?

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.460
Sure. Sleep well.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.810
I remember feeling
an enormous sense of relief...

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:46.150
...that she didn't let him
into her room or kiss him.

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:53.150
Alice, are you decent?

01:00:56.330 --> 01:00:57.330
Yes.

01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:06.410
- What is it?
- I was saving this till I sold my novel.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.250
You're a broker, not a novelist.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:14.130
Actually, I'm starting it this summer,
but I've got it all worked out in my head.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.840
This is really sweet,
but not tonight. I'm tired.

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.190
Oh, just a short one. Come on.

01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:27.980
I really admire what you do.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.610
You're so unlike all the other women
I meet. You don't seem...

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.530
-...caught up in the bullshit.
- Not yet anyway.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.360
Richard...

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:42.410
I'm really gonna have to say
good night.

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:45.070
There's something I haven't told you.

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:48.370
My wife left me three months ago.

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:53.040
God, I'm such a mess.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.050
Can't work, can't sleep.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.470
Richard, don't cry.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.560
I'm sure it's what's best for her.

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:14.560
- And you.
- I need you!

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.900
Richard, stop!

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.320
I'm sorry.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:26.740
I'm sorry.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.740
I don't know what came over me.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.590
Maybe I misunderstood the situation
this weekend.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.910
I'm sorry if you thought
that we were...

01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:37.580
- This is awkward.
- Just forget it happened.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.460
- Don't tell anybody I cried, okay?
- Okay.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.680
Good night.

01:02:57.150 --> 01:03:00.270
About the time she fell asleep,
I stopped kidding myself.

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:03.110
I was nuts about her.

01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:11.040
Why couldn't I have met her a year ago?

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.460
Probably would have messed it up.

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:16.880
Right here. Set it down.
Quick. Hurry up.

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:19.650
Yeah. Got it.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.640
- Wait a minute, George.
- What?

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.420
Just pin my arms down.
Good. Okay.

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:31.680
Wait a minute.
Could you just squeeze my butt?

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:34.610
Yeah. That's it.
Okay.

01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:38.100
Wait a minute. No, George...

01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:40.030
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- God.

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.020
Fate was cruel.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.820
Well, that was memorable.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.280
Just give me 10 minutes.

01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:49.490
Look at the moon or something.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:55.240
That night, I moved to the house
down the beach.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.970
The next day, I decided to call her.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:16.760
Hello?

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.020
Hello?

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:22.810
- Alice?
- Yes.

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:24.700
I need to talk to you.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.190
Who is this?

01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:29.620
It's Nick. Nick Halloway.
Remember me?

01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:32.110
Nick Halloway. Is this a joke?

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:36.290
Listen, please don't tell anybody.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:38.950
I'm in the gray-and-white house
down the beach.

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:41.370
I'll leave the door open for you.

01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:44.120
Can you come down here, please?

01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:46.380
Please, Alice.

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.580
Hello?

01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:26.670
Hello?

01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:30.220
Back here.

01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:31.550
Nick?

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:53.110
Alice, don't be afraid.
It's me, Nick.

01:05:56.290 --> 01:06:00.120
- Were you in an accident?
- Yeah.

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:03.620
Oh, what happened?
Were you burned or something?

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.540
You want to sit down?

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:07.420
No.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:29.100
Where the hell did she run to?
Bodega Bay?

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.690
It's been over two hours.

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:33.820
You never know.
Attractive girl, jogging alone.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:38.450
I wouldn't worry about that, George.
She's as strong as an ox.

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.420
I will not allow you to turn this
into another fiasco...

01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:51.590
-...like you did in Iran.
- I'm getting the job done.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.600
I'm your section head!
I gave you this chance!

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.840
Wachs was supposed to be
in Washington two days ago.

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:01.510
- Where the hell is he?
- Wachs is sequestered.

01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:06.180
I'm not convinced he's been entirely
forthcoming with us. Now calm down.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.160
Trust me.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:11.390
All right. When do I get him?

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:13.070
- When I'm convinced.
- No.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:18.400
- When do I get the invisible man?
- He may be here still, but I doubt it.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:22.450
- I'll get him soon. Very soon.
- I hope so. It's my ass on the line.

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:26.870
I won't justify these expenditures
and methods with no results!

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.200
I want him, and if I don't get him...

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:32.880
...you will be the next person
to disappear.

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:36.220
Perhaps a reminder of the state of things
might be in order.

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:39.220
I'm the one that kills people, Warren.
Not you.

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:41.880
And if you screw up on me...

01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:45.020
...I will cut off your testicles,
fry them...

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:48.640
...and Morrissey here
will have them for lunch.

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:04.070
Nick, maybe this isn't
the right thing to do.

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:07.870
Running and hiding.
Maybe you should be in the hospital.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.670
Not a chance.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.910
They know every move I make.

01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:15.670
Besides, there's nothing a doctor can do.
I feel normal.

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:20.550
I probably could use a shave,
but who's gonna notice?

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:30.430
For years, women have been telling me
they can see right through me. Christ!

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.939
Can I touch you?

01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:43.569
Oh, my God.

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:45.870
Oh, my God.

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:49.120
You do need a shave.

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:52.960
I never realized how important it is
to be seen.

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:55.120
You know? Acknowledged.

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:58.470
You start questioning whether
you exist at all.

01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:02.140
Oh, Nick.

01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:08.510
I guess I forgive you
for standing me up.

01:09:08.979 --> 01:09:12.149
The last thing you want to do
is watch me eat.

01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:17.140
So how can I help you?

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:23.990
Open a brokerage account, buy me 2000
shares of a stock called Allied Resources.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:38.380
- Having seconds?
- Yeah. I suddenly got hungry again.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.170
Must have been all that running
you did this afternoon.

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.939
Must be.

01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:52.290
Well...

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.680
I'll just take this up to my room and...

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.810
I'm going to turn in early.
See you in the morning.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.200
I can get the broker to buy stock
without you having to spend any cash.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.370
Okay.

01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:12.830
You'll play what's called a "float."
I trade through you and stockpile money.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.040
I cut you a check for half,
and I'm out of your life.

01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:19.540
Were you in here last night?

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.800
Who? Me?
You mean last night, in this room?

01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:27.510
- Nothing would have happened, you know.
- Oh, hey, I know that.

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.050
Did you hang around afterward?

01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:34.470
Alice, I didn't see a thing.
I had my hands over my eyes.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:37.480
Of course, you can see
right through them.

01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:46.400
Good night, George.

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:52.250
This has been a terrific weekend.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:56.160
- I'm glad at least you got laid.
- Well, it was only Ellen.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.380
I think you're crazy, letting her stay here.

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:02.750
She's a family friend.
Should I say no?

01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:06.340
You told me you heard two voices
coming out of her room.

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:08.720
Suppose she's really schizo?

01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:15.100
Ah, George.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.550
You're the best. This will be the perfect
place for me to get some work done.

01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:22.440
I left the number of a good therapist.

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:25.450
If you feel like talking,
she's very understanding.

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:27.900
She's helped Richard a lot.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.280
Thanks, George.

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.990
Good to know
Richard's getting some help.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:40.120
Chuck, it's George.
Wanna hear a hot one?

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:43.130
Guess who broke into my house
and ran up $500...

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:46.880
...on food and booze on my accounts.
Nick Halloway.

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:50.880
No, he's not dead. He's on a binge.

01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:55.060
- This is ridiculous.
- No, it is not.

01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:57.760
Just let me finish.
You owe me a meal anyway.

01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:01.690
I'm sure you have better things to do,
places to go, people to see.

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:04.480
First of all, I don't have
better things to do.

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:07.360
I'm in between projects right now...

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.570
...and I'm not seeing anybody.

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.950
That's an understatement.

01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:19.990
It's a hell of a lot more comfortable
than that Ace bandage.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.740
It really works.

01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:26.750
Oh, Nick, you have a face again.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.960
If I had eyes and teeth,
I'd be a whole head.

01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:36.180
It's nice to see you.

01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:39.180
It's nice to be seen again.

01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:45.570
Do you have any body makeup?
Dropped about 10 pounds.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:48.020
Bet I'd look great naked.

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.700
Good evening. Two for dinner?

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:57.700
Yes, please.

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:02.580
What's the matter?
ls something wrong?

01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:06.750
Of course not, sir. Right this way.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.970
See? Nobody's staring at you.

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:19.560
Whatever they think, they certainly
don't think you're invisible.

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:20.730
No.

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.180
They're just seeing a beautiful blond
and a dead man.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:27.890
To Elvis.

01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:40.510
Oh, God.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.790
Maybe we do have
a little more work to do.

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:51.840
You can go to any ball game
or movie for free.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:56.340
You can look up girls' skirts,
hang around ladies' locker rooms.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.640
- Go naked anytime you want.
- Almost have to now.

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:06.560
Never worry about people saying
you look older or you should lose weight.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.520
You could have a brilliant career
as a bank robber.

01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:15.780
Jesus, I'm screwed.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.480
Nick...

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.570
...I've been thinking.

01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:26.950
I'm not sure me playing
the stock market...

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:31.620
...so you can live like a recluse
is the best solution to your problem.

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.500
You got a better idea, Alice,
believe me, I'm interested.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.090
We could go to Washington. I know
some people who might be able to help.

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:43.560
You expect me to trust a politician?

01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:46.350
No, you're right.

01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:50.140
But I want you to trust me.

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.190
You're not alone anymore.

01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:14.170
Come on!

01:15:29.230 --> 01:15:32.850
It's them. My clothes
are on the corner of the couch.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.450
- Where are we going?
- Far away. Fast.

01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:14.850
May I have your attention, please?

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:18.390
Announcing the departure
of train number seven...

01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:40.840
- Nick?
- I'm here.

01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:49.970
I got us a compartment
on the 7:30 train to San Diego.

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:54.470
From there, we can figure out
how to get across the border to Mexico.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:58.180
That gives us about eight hours to kill.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:02.770
Look, they're gonna catch me, Alice.
Just get on the train. Go.

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:05.110
Get away from me.
These guys are nuts.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.070
I'd never forgive myself
if something happened to you.

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:12.460
I'm not scared. Whoever these guys are,
they can't control everything.

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:15.870
God, I can't believe I got you into this.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.700
Forgive me.

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.580
This is something I have to do
on my own.

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:36.180
Alice...

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.810
...you're staring at my eyes.

01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:42.640
I think we should get out of the rain.

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:51.150
What's happening to me?

01:17:51.330 --> 01:17:52.530
Don't.

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.120
It's beautiful.

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:16.930
Boy, how am I gonna tell my mom
about this?

01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:22.310
All the dirty parts I'd leave out.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:27.110
Just tell her you met a guy,
like him a lot...

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.950
...could be serious. He's transparent.

01:18:33.370 --> 01:18:36.540
- Are you a Catholic?
- No.

01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:39.030
That could be a problem.

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.380
You know something, Alice?

01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:49.380
If you were blind,
we'd make the perfect couple.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.730
May I have your attention, please?

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:06.400
Now ready for departure,
train number 12, Pacific Coast...

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:13.370
...now leaving on track number five.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.900
I'm in.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.910
That was easy enough.

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:33.630
This isn't so bad.

01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:42.100
I'm having second thoughts about Mexico.

01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:44.850
It's just not far enough away.

01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:49.270
With a fax and a computer,
I can trade from anywhere in the world.

01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:53.030
You mean anywhere?
Like Paris, Rome...

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:54.770
...Bora Bora?

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.240
Anywhere you want.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.930
Although I was thinking of Switzerland.

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:22.720
A guy can get away with wearing
a ski mask all year round.

01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:35.150
Where's the next stop?

01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:53.010
Nick?

01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:56.960
- You asleep?
- No.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.810
I was just daydreaming
about a New York strip steak...

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:06.270
...baked potato with sour cream
and chives and a hot fudge sundae.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.730
That sounds great.

01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:13.980
I'll go get it.
Bring back a bowl of Jell-O for you.

01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:19.700
Thanks.

01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:44.850
Hello, Alice.

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:57.780
Compartment C.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.840
Run!

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:15.460
Nick!

01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:17.420
Run!

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:20.840
Run!

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:26.760
- Run!
- Halloway!

01:22:28.230 --> 01:22:29.430
Alice!

01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:50.950
Move! Move!
Get out of the way!

01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:03.430
No!

01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:16.650
The current must have swept me along
for half a mile.

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:19.860
When I came to, I was being washed
toward a drainage pipe...

01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:22.270
...and throwing up a gallon
of river water.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:33.500
For all you knew, I'd drowned.
Your invisible man was dead.

01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:36.340
But I knew you had Alice.

01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:45.290
I was wrong to involve her in
the first place, Just like I was wrong...

01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:47.590
...thinking I could run away from this.

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.520
I am what I am, Jenkins.
I know that now.

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.060
Other people will too,
unless you let her go.

01:23:53.230 --> 01:23:56.730
You let her go, I'll come in.
That's the deal.

01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:59.230
I'll say this.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.780
Your friend Halloway
has a flair for the dramatic.

01:24:05.490 --> 01:24:08.610
I want you to be part of our team, Alice.

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:11.530
He needs you. We need you.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:17.700
Regardless of how it may seem, I've never
had anything but his best interest at heart.

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:21.550
Where do they find people like you?

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:24.540
It's him. He's on the phone.

01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:31.890
Nick.

01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:36.060
I've got copies of that tape
in very safe hands right now.

01:24:36.230 --> 01:24:40.230
Anything happens to Alice,
they go to the networks, the papers.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.190
Use your imagination.

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:46.230
Alice is here. She's absolutely fine.
What do you want me to do?

01:24:46.410 --> 01:24:49.910
I want to see her walk out of the building
and get in a cab.

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:51.740
And what about you?

01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:55.080
Look out your window at the phone booth
on the corner.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.320
Yeah, I see you.

01:24:59.130 --> 01:25:03.080
As soon as I see her out of your building
and in a cab, I give myself up.

01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:06.420
Try anything funny,
I do a striptease in the street...

01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:08.670
...I'll guarantee will make the news.

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:11.800
Two minutes, Jenkins, starting now.

01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:14.000
Let's go.

01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:33.270
- I presume you've seen this.
- He's outside. We're five seconds away.

01:25:33.450 --> 01:25:36.740
- You murdered Wachs?
- He's holding me against my will.

01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:41.580
We've won, Warren. He's ours.
We can own the agency.

01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:44.790
You've lost it.
You don't know what you're doing.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:49.920
- I'm pulling the plug. Let her go!
- As soon as we make the switch.

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:10.190
Just like we agreed, Nick.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:14.280
- Get the cab, Tyler.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:28.000
Nick, I love you!

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:32.510
Take her across the bridge
or something. Go!

01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.950
We had a deal, Nick.

01:26:58.330 --> 01:27:00.700
You shouldn't have tried to run.

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:06.210
Hey, not so rough.

01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:07.580
Jesus.

01:27:16.050 --> 01:27:17.710
Where's Nick?

01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:25.890
Wait a minute.
Where are we going?

01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:27.970
The Bay Bridge.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.480
And I love you too.

01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:33.860
Nick?

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:38.270
Nick. Oh, my God!

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:40.030
Oh, look out.

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.900
That was George in the phone booth.
I called Jenkins with this.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:46.570
- You told George you were invisible?
- Of course not.

01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:50.420
Told him you we're in trouble.
Asked him for a big favor.

01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:52.750
God, I'm glad you're all right.

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.390
I got him.

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:23.790
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:27.210
Nick, run! Run!

01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:30.330
Help!

01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:32.130
Help!

01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:48.230
I've got him crossing Seventh Street
back toward Market.

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:57.640
- Market Street.
- It's over!

01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:01.650
You hear me? I'm shutting you down!
I'm shutting you down!

01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:17.160
- He's heading south.
- Left on Fifth.

01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:21.130
Look. What about what Singleton said?
He signs the checks.

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:24.340
Screw him. He's weak.
They're all weak.

01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:29.180
Think what Halloway will fetch.
The Germans, the Japanese, the Saudis.

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.260
You'll be a rich man, Morrissey.

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:07.060
Oh, my God! Look at that!

01:30:07.930 --> 01:30:09.680
What was that?

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:29.130
You're a natural, you know.
Cool, imaginative, elegant.

01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:31.880
You've found your calling, Nick.

01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:37.560
I think we can work this thing out
together, you and l. Forgive and forget.

01:31:37.730 --> 01:31:42.970
Start again fresh, with a deeper sense
of respect for each other.

01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:56.280
Nick, I'll kill you if I have to!

01:32:00.170 --> 01:32:01.990
Now listen.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.750
I'll commit every resource we have
to getting you back...

01:32:06.930 --> 01:32:09.130
...to making you whole again...

01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:12.470
...to reuniting you with Alice.
I swear.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.760
You swore you would kill me
a second ago.

01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:18.270
I think you're losing your marbles, Dave.
Get it straight.

01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:40.910
Bit of a tight spot, Nick.

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:43.990
Now, understand...

01:32:44.670 --> 01:32:46.880
...if I can't have you...

01:32:47.130 --> 01:32:49.090
...no one can.

01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:53.680
I'm tired of the game, Dave.

01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:58.260
One step back, and it's all over.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.960
Now wait.

01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:03.470
I apologize for being rash.
It was stupid of me.

01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:08.360
You are the most unique human being
on the planet.

01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:10.900
You are walking history.

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:14.240
Don't run away from it, man.
Embrace it!

01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:23.250
You'll never know what it's like.

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:26.330
Don't. Now, don't, Nick.

01:33:27.090 --> 01:33:29.380
Don't come any closer!

01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:31.880
Come on, Nick.
Just give me your hand.

01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:34.890
- No! No! No!
- Give me your hand.

01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:39.000
Olé, you son of a bitch!

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.600
Nick!

01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:07.870
Leave it alone. You didn't see anything.
You don't know anything.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.660
You didn't hear any of this.
Be smart.

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:16.000
Clean it up. It never happened.

01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:30.640
- What did you lose, a contact lens?
- Nick!

01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:33.650
Don't say anything.
Let's just get out of here.

01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:36.360
- Look sad.
- Okay.

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.990
My department had been alerted
to Mr. Jenkins'...

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.570
...deteriorating emotional state.

01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:48.000
Of course, none of us
ever expected a tragedy like this.

01:34:48.170 --> 01:34:51.170
I think you can all appreciate how...

01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:56.170
Oh, Nick.
I never want to lose you.

01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:58.630
You won't. I promise.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.650
It's keeping track of our kids
that's got me worried.
