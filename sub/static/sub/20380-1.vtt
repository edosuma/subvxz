01:52.969 --> 01:55.732
This is a little souvenir...
picture of my best pal...

01:55.932 --> 01:57.713
Sam Tucker and his folks

01:57.813 --> 01:59.666
Believe me, they don't come no better...

01:59.766 --> 02:02.783
Only, when old Sam gets an idea
in that hard head of his...

02:02.983 --> 02:05.111
he don't behoove with nothin' else.

02:05.911 --> 02:07.003
This is Nona...

02:07.103 --> 02:08.476
Sam's wife.

02:09.524 --> 02:11.732
And here's Sam's ma... a widow-woman

02:11.832 --> 02:14.603
Ma ain't so young...
but her heart's still full of fire.

02:16.041 --> 02:18.936
Harmie here ain't no Tucker...
just a good friend.

02:19.036 --> 02:21.110
If he looks kinda
sheep-eyed, it's because

02:21.123 --> 02:23.402
he's all lit up with that
flame in Ma's heart.

02:23.831 --> 02:25.724
These are the youngest
of the Tucker clan.

02:25.824 --> 02:28.881
Sam's kids... Daisy and Jotty.

02:29.542 --> 02:30.848
And here's Sam's granny.

02:30.948 --> 02:33.323
She didn't like having her
picture took, neither.

02:34.082 --> 02:37.123
This one's me...
I'm a town man myself.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.909
Only come home for fairs
and weddings and stuff.

02:40.009 --> 02:42.732
That's how come I cherish
this picture show...

02:42.832 --> 02:45.720
Makes me feel close to my friends,
to look at it.

03:27.282 --> 03:30.586
Sam... Sam...

03:31.965 --> 03:33.364
What's the matter, Uncle Pete?

03:33.464 --> 03:35.822
- It's all so hot!
- Hey, Nona!

03:57.099 --> 03:58.046
My hat...

04:01.022 --> 04:02.226
You lie here, Uncle Pete...

04:02.326 --> 04:03.344
Get some water.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.700
It's my darned old heart.

04:13.007 --> 04:15.607
You just lie here, Uncle Pete...
I'll finish your row for you.

04:15.707 --> 04:17.796
Much obliged to you, Sam.

04:18.891 --> 04:20.071
I gotta take my cotton back,
now, Honey.

04:20.171 --> 04:21.375
I'll take care of Uncle Pete.

04:45.891 --> 04:48.292
Uncle Pete's sick,
I'm gonna finish his row.

05:00.275 --> 05:01.915
Where are you going
after the crop's over?

05:03.063 --> 05:05.321
I figured I might stay here...
I got me a bulldozing job.

05:05.421 --> 05:07.951
- Where are you going?
- I think I'm going north next year.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.617
- Can I sit down?
- Hi fellas.

05:12.528 --> 05:14.066
- Hot.
- Yeah.

05:31.950 --> 05:33.111
How is he, Honey?

05:35.040 --> 05:36.491
He ain't so good.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.239
Look for yourself...

05:42.149 --> 05:44.492
Grow your own crops.

05:46.801 --> 05:48.401
You want some more water, Uncle Pete?

05:50.929 --> 05:52.857
Grow your own crops.

06:20.315 --> 06:22.834
I wish we could raise him
a tombstone.

06:23.773 --> 06:25.564
That's for folks that got money.

06:29.774 --> 06:31.279
Come here, "Zoomy".

06:39.401 --> 06:40.524
Jotty...

07:14.938 --> 07:16.708
My eyes hurt!

07:16.808 --> 07:18.913
Oh, does it, Jotty?

07:21.095 --> 07:22.857
Granny!... Granny!

07:24.884 --> 07:26.190
Here, Honey... hold him.

07:26.676 --> 07:28.542
Look at the fast grapes!

07:32.696 --> 07:34.605
Don't you want any fast grapes, Granny?

07:34.705 --> 07:37.347
I don't want to get mixed up
with no copperheads!

07:37.447 --> 07:40.700
Already wearin' one crooky toe
on o' them scoundrels ruined!

07:52.376 --> 07:55.385
Don't be a hog, Daisy...
Leave a few for the next fella!

07:55.485 --> 07:57.430
I thought you was afeard of snakes!

07:57.717 --> 08:01.954
I am... but that ain't no sign
I got to starve to death, is it?

08:02.644 --> 08:05.245
You know that little San Pedro place
down near the river?

08:05.537 --> 08:07.097
I heard of it... I ain't never seen it.

08:07.174 --> 08:08.861
Well, that belongs to the boss, too.

08:08.961 --> 08:11.457
Old Ike at the commissary
was tellin' me it was for rent.

08:11.557 --> 08:13.192
Been layin' out there now
for three years...

08:13.292 --> 08:15.075
It should be as rich as mud.

08:15.175 --> 08:18.650
In the old days, old man Corinth used to
raise the best crops in the country on it.

08:18.750 --> 08:22.763
If it's been layin' out all that time,
it'll take a whole year to clear it off.

08:22.790 --> 08:23.936
Yeah.

08:30.865 --> 08:33.585
Nony... Nony come here!

08:38.715 --> 08:42.443
Behave yourself...
Don't you be always teasin' Granny.

08:44.265 --> 08:47.168
I reckon I could ask old man Neward
for his mules...

08:47.268 --> 08:48.739
He don't ever hardly use 'em,
no how.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.434
Same with the bed of the crop.

08:51.333 --> 08:54.262
As for seeds and fertilizer...
I bet I could make a deal with Harmie.

08:54.807 --> 08:57.311
And as for a plough,
there's that old one of Pa's...

08:57.411 --> 08:59.645
been layin' out in Ma's backyard
ever since he died...

08:59.745 --> 09:01.825
Ain't been used for nothin'
but roostin' chickens on.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.438
I'm gonna ask the boss about it.

09:04.473 --> 09:06.473
Askin' don't do no harm.

09:06.573 --> 09:09.229
No askin'... or work either...
don't harm a man.

09:10.020 --> 09:12.492
After all, the boss
is a pretty good guy.

09:12.592 --> 09:14.068
We always been friends.

09:17.155 --> 09:19.743
Jotty, Dis, Granny... come on!

09:39.426 --> 09:42.701
It's OK with me, Tucker...
I ain't interested in that piece o' land.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.245
Too far away from my other property.

09:45.345 --> 09:46.757
But just remember this...

09:46.957 --> 09:50.288
If I ain't satisfied
with the way you're workin' it...

09:50.388 --> 09:53.691
I aim to break that contract
any time I like.

09:56.130 --> 09:57.688
It's alright with me, boss.

09:59.134 --> 10:00.206
I like you, Tucker.

10:00.406 --> 10:01.788
You're a good hard-worker.

10:01.888 --> 10:03.977
And that's why I'm botherin' to warn you...

10:04.177 --> 10:05.614
Now, I'm tellin' you again...

10:05.714 --> 10:07.870
If you're workin' for a big outfit...

10:07.970 --> 10:09.457
Maybe you don't get rich...

10:10.207 --> 10:13.071
But you still get your pay...
even if the crops is bad.

10:13.271 --> 10:15.913
But the little guy,
who's growin' his own...

10:16.113 --> 10:18.311
If his crop is ruined...

10:18.411 --> 10:19.858
He's got nothin' left.

10:21.283 --> 10:23.400
I see you've made up your mind.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.192
Got some way of movin' your things?

10:25.392 --> 10:27.040
Yessir... Coreo said I
could borrow his truck.

10:27.041 --> 10:29.042
OK... Good luck, Tucker!

10:29.043 --> 10:29.839
Thank you, sir.

10:55.710 --> 10:58.274
How far is our house
from the river, Papa?

10:58.275 --> 11:00.561
Why, it's almost just right next
to the river, Honey!

11:00.562 --> 11:02.650
Goody... goody!

11:29.459 --> 11:32.726
Don't look like no house
at all to me.

11:34.182 --> 11:36.512
Looks more like a cow shed!

11:36.513 --> 11:41.466
I'd rather live back there in that dirty
old camp than a heap o' junk like that!

11:43.067 --> 11:46.540
Ain't never gonna get me
to go into that old tin hole

11:47.741 --> 11:50.849
Bringin' their old granny
to this scrubby place!

11:50.850 --> 11:54.372
I see they don't love me no more
than if I was a yellow dog!

11:54.373 --> 11:58.877
I always hoped we could have a room
to ourselves, some day.

11:58.878 --> 12:02.094
We can have... when summer comes.

12:02.826 --> 12:06.302
Let Granny and the kids sleep in here...
and move our bed out on the porch.

12:06.303 --> 12:08.971
And have everything real nice.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.078
Oh, Sam...

12:12.157 --> 12:14.690
The house don't seem
like nothin' extra!

12:14.691 --> 12:17.510
Seems like extra one thing...

12:17.511 --> 12:19.180
Pretty darn extra bad.

12:19.788 --> 12:22.053
I reckon I was thinkin' too hard
about the land...

12:22.054 --> 12:23.965
I plum forgot about the house.

12:25.193 --> 12:27.444
There sure be some patchin' to do.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.590
More 'n a little!

12:33.904 --> 12:35.652
What about the well, Sam?

12:36.619 --> 12:37.578
Let's go look at it.

12:39.390 --> 12:42.282
I was crazy to think
we could live in this place.

12:42.283 --> 12:45.941
Why, it'd take me at least 2 weeks
to dig this well again.

12:45.942 --> 12:49.736
Without even talkin' about the
money the planks and beams w'd cost!

12:49.737 --> 12:54.480
Tain't much of a man that brings
his babies and his womenfolks

12:54.481 --> 12:57.446
to soak and freeze...
in such a hole as this!

13:01.830 --> 13:03.328
Maybe she's right.

13:03.329 --> 13:05.477
Water from that river,
for the kids...

13:05.478 --> 13:08.319
'd just be like servin' them up
a dish of typhoid.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.415
Tain't much of a man, I say!

13:14.368 --> 13:16.888
Look, Honey... we can still
go back to the camp, if you want to.

13:17.514 --> 13:19.569
The boss couldn't have knowed
how bad the place is.

13:19.570 --> 13:23.869
I could talk to him again, and still maybe
get my bulldozing job for the winter.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.445
Well...

13:26.914 --> 13:28.645
How's the ground?

13:29.453 --> 13:30.653
Oh, it's good earth alright...

13:31.575 --> 13:34.473
You know, with dirt like this, a fella
could raise the best crop in the country.

13:34.474 --> 13:36.105
Been layin' out all these years.

13:36.873 --> 13:39.967
The earth's kinda like men, you know...
It needs a rest every once in a while.

13:39.968 --> 13:42.629
Maybe that's the reason
the Lord invented Sunday.

13:42.630 --> 13:44.730
But how about all this brush
and Johnson grass?

13:44.731 --> 13:47.297
You'll kill yourself gettin' rid of it
before the plantin'.

13:47.298 --> 13:49.518
I ain't all alone Honey...
I ain't like Uncle Pete.

13:49.519 --> 13:53.424
Every time i get plum wore out...
I think of you and Jotty and Daisy...

13:54.020 --> 13:55.673
And I ain't quite so tired anymore.

13:55.806 --> 13:56.906
Oh, Sam!

13:57.007 --> 13:59.494
I just could never get along
without you.

13:59.495 --> 14:02.017
Me too, Honey...
I couldn't live without you.

14:03.119 --> 14:05.751
The thing that'd be good about it is
we could always work together.

14:05.752 --> 14:08.358
When you did the ploughin'
I could lead the mules... and...

14:08.359 --> 14:11.963
When you clean up this brush,
I could burn it for you... and...

14:11.964 --> 14:15.315
Summertime we could lie in the grass
and watch the kids swimmin' in the river.

14:15.316 --> 14:16.476
Yeah... that'd be fun, Honey!

14:17.481 --> 14:19.777
But what worries me
is that busted well.

14:20.740 --> 14:23.099
Oh, Sam... we could surely borrow water
from the neighbour, yonder...

14:23.100 --> 14:24.715
Nobody refuses water.

14:24.716 --> 14:27.199
Yeah... I hear he's got a good well.

14:28.343 --> 14:31.047
Sam... I reckon we ought to stay!

14:32.737 --> 14:33.595
You really mean that?

14:33.596 --> 14:35.785
You ain't just sayin' that
to make me feel good?

14:35.786 --> 14:38.022
I'm sayin' it because I believe
you're as good as any man...

14:38.023 --> 14:40.570
and it's right for you
to be your own boss.

14:43.449 --> 14:46.838
Hey, you two...
You ain't all alone here, you know!

14:52.469 --> 14:55.577
Hey there... we've got enough... we're
moving in and it's all ironed... come on.

14:55.578 --> 14:57.511
Come on... give me a hand.

15:01.014 --> 15:04.396
You take the pictures...
mind you don't drop 'em.

15:10.055 --> 15:11.852
Come on sweetie...
I'll help you down

15:11.853 --> 15:12.762
No you don't!

15:15.296 --> 15:17.276
I don't want aim to go no...

15:21.402 --> 15:23.118
Can't even say it...
me I'm a lady.

15:23.119 --> 15:25.653
Alright old lady...
but you better be down before morning...

15:25.654 --> 15:27.522
or you'll go right back to camp
with this truck.

15:27.523 --> 15:29.811
Old man Coreo mightn't
like it too much, neither.

15:36.049 --> 15:40.233
Sam Tucker! My own grandson
gone as crazy as a bedbug!

15:40.234 --> 15:42.390
Total crazy I tell you!

15:42.391 --> 15:44.775
Crazy as a bedbug!

15:44.776 --> 15:47.503
You've gone completely silly!

15:50.297 --> 15:53.029
He's clean outta his mind,
I tell ya!

16:17.352 --> 16:19.977
There's so much...
You're downright mean!

16:19.978 --> 16:25.068
They gotta take out their cussedness
on somebody's old folks!

16:27.841 --> 16:30.847
I done had my share
and I ain't takin' no more no how!

16:30.947 --> 16:32.714
I takin' no more!

16:33.818 --> 16:37.681
Ain't exactly a veranda, honey... but to me
it's the porch that makes the house a home!

16:37.781 --> 16:39.745
Sam, I think I got the stove working!

16:45.081 --> 16:46.378
We'll all light it together.

17:24.847 --> 17:27.236
Our first fire in our own house.

17:27.237 --> 17:29.712
Yeah... You sure made a good job
of that stove, Honey.

17:29.713 --> 17:32.251
Won't be long before we'll have
a good hot cup of coffee.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.943
You get some water, Sam.

17:33.984 --> 17:36.762
Jotty, Daisy... get the cups
and put 'em on the table.

17:43.873 --> 17:46.569
You reckon Granny's gonna
stay out there all night?

17:46.583 --> 17:48.689
I'd say she'll be too coward.

17:49.703 --> 17:51.229
Dis... you go call Granny.

17:58.933 --> 18:01.825
Granny... you want some good hot coffee?

18:01.860 --> 18:07.059
No sir! Nothin' what comes outta that
old pot don't tempt me none at all!

18:26.296 --> 18:30.255
Mama, it's raining and
Granny won't come in!

18:30.256 --> 18:33.144
Well, we'll have our coffee anyway.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.385
Sit down, Honey...
I'll get it.

18:43.553 --> 18:46.139
Oh, Papa... there's a hole in the ceiling!

19:28.868 --> 19:30.435
Granny's changed her mind!

19:34.536 --> 19:36.023
Come on Granny.

19:38.856 --> 19:40.197
Here, I've got your good blanket...

19:40.198 --> 19:42.540
Now put it around you before you catch
your death of cold.

19:52.632 --> 19:54.388
Here's some honey, Granny.

19:55.263 --> 19:55.963
Honey!...

19:56.905 --> 19:59.269
They not only let me die
of the cold...

19:59.270 --> 20:01.572
But they hide out the goodies on me!

20:44.097 --> 20:46.250
How do you want your bedcover, honey?

20:48.450 --> 20:50.661
With the fire going,
it's nice and warm in here.

21:02.568 --> 21:04.110
Goodnight Granny.

21:53.890 --> 21:55.304
Nona, come on over here.

22:08.531 --> 22:11.502
Oh, that's a pretty one, Sam!

22:11.503 --> 22:13.319
Yeah, Honey... that's a mighty fine fish!

22:13.320 --> 22:14.625
It'll make us a good dinner.

22:14.626 --> 22:16.789
Well I figured I'd take
this one to Denvers,

22:16.802 --> 22:19.072
our neighbour down the
road, with a good well.

22:20.498 --> 22:22.150
That little one in the bucket's
for us.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.679
Aren't you gonna put on dry clothes?

22:24.680 --> 22:27.174
Oh, I'll dry it off walkin' over...
won't be gone long.

22:27.175 --> 22:28.737
You'd better keep Zoomy here.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.448
This one ain't so big, honey.

22:32.219 --> 22:35.370
Well I'll catch us another tomorrow...
a big one... we'll keep it

22:41.856 --> 22:43.406
Go along with your mama, Jotty.

23:09.896 --> 23:11.757
Mighty fine place
you got around here.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.265
You the owner?
You Henry Devers?

23:13.266 --> 23:15.322
- No, folks call me Finlay.
- Howdy!

23:16.314 --> 23:18.133
He's my uncle...
He's over yonder in the shed.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.359
Much obliged... Finlay.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.254
Howdy!

23:37.363 --> 23:38.591
What do you want?

23:38.592 --> 23:40.410
I'm your neighbour...
my name's Sam Tucker...

23:40.411 --> 23:41.861
I brought you a fish.

23:41.862 --> 23:42.886
Mean do I want to buy it?

23:42.887 --> 23:43.921
No... It's a present.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.784
Well, leave it if you got no use for it.

23:47.507 --> 23:48.279
Where'll I put it?

23:48.654 --> 23:50.715
Any place... on the bench.

23:53.664 --> 23:55.974
Say, that's a mighty queer-lookin'
fishhook you picked up.

23:55.975 --> 23:58.914
I ain't no graveller...
I fish hook and line.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.156
Aim to use it in this river?

24:00.157 --> 24:02.808
Aim to use it any place I feel like it.
Finlay!

24:16.870 --> 24:19.554
Take this here fish, and give it
to Becky to cook for dinner.

24:19.555 --> 24:21.943
Are you the new neighbour?...
I'm Becky Devers.

24:21.944 --> 24:23.360
Yes'm... we're the Tuckers.

24:23.361 --> 24:25.655
Be nice havin' folks next door...
It's lonesome here.

24:25.656 --> 24:27.544
What are you doin' here...
I didn't send for you.

24:27.545 --> 24:28.591
Well, I thought, pop...

24:28.592 --> 24:31.192
You don't have to think...
Get that fish and go back to the house.

24:32.139 --> 24:33.758
And you get your washin' finished!

24:44.598 --> 24:47.377
My wife be likely over soon
to borrow some of your well water.

24:47.378 --> 24:50.513
So that's what you come for!

24:50.514 --> 24:52.760
That's right.
My well ain't no good.

24:52.761 --> 24:54.702
I coulda told you that.

24:55.999 --> 24:57.144
So can I, now.

24:58.232 --> 24:59.472
What about that water?

25:00.410 --> 25:02.067
Why don't you get your water
at the river.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.445
River water ain't no good
for kids to drink.

25:07.567 --> 25:09.679
Alright...
As long as there's plenty of water.

25:10.447 --> 25:12.847
You'll have to make other arrangements,
though, when summer comes.

25:12.848 --> 25:14.837
Gets pretty weak
when the weather's dry.

25:15.702 --> 25:18.507
We'll take turns about replacin'
the wore-out rope.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.786
Seems pretty wore-out already.

25:22.787 --> 25:27.005
Well, if you don't like it, next well's
5 miles down the road.

25:28.490 --> 25:29.805
Suits me.

25:29.806 --> 25:33.136
Alright... so long Devers.

25:33.601 --> 25:34.724
Just a minute!

25:36.059 --> 25:38.232
You're likely gonna fix your own well,
ain't you?

25:38.233 --> 25:41.364
If you're rentin' you must have
some savings put aside.

25:41.365 --> 25:44.436
I got 2 good arms...
worth more than savings.

25:45.741 --> 25:47.834
To hear folks talk...
you think you can be

25:47.847 --> 25:50.196
farmers just like that...
with your bare hands.

25:50.197 --> 25:52.620
Got any tools or tractors?

25:52.621 --> 25:54.358
No, I ain't got no tractor.

25:54.359 --> 25:57.823
But I got 2 mules and a good old plough...
and a friend o' mine's lendin' the seed.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.698
And Ruston furnishes the fertilizer.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.670
Don't need much
for good muddy land like that.

26:03.387 --> 26:06.564
And he gives the poison for the weevils,
pays the cotton-pickers...

26:06.565 --> 26:09.096
even lets you draw grub
from his commissary.

26:09.097 --> 26:11.181
After you get the ground broke.

26:11.772 --> 26:14.656
Yeah... he just furnishes
about everything...

26:15.300 --> 26:16.662
With the sweat.

26:16.663 --> 26:18.273
And if you get by the year...

26:18.274 --> 26:20.586
he generously lets you
take your share of the crop...

26:20.587 --> 26:21.553
Ain't that right?

26:21.554 --> 26:24.056
Why ask me... It seems
you know it already.

26:24.057 --> 26:25.859
Oh, but I know Ruston...

26:25.860 --> 26:28.880
Ain't the first time he's gettin'
a piece of land cleaned off for nothin'.

26:29.709 --> 26:31.525
Until you get your ploughin' started...

26:32.878 --> 26:34.545
how do you aim to eat?

26:34.546 --> 26:36.272
I aim to fish...

26:36.273 --> 26:38.285
and hunt varmints
and sell a few skins.

26:38.714 --> 26:40.705
Lots of folks like that
live around here.

26:40.706 --> 26:42.234
Plenty more done it before.

26:43.790 --> 26:44.999
How about you?

26:45.467 --> 26:46.648
How'd you get started?

26:51.309 --> 26:52.428
Sharecrop.

26:53.539 --> 26:56.662
First year I lost my whole crop,
it was ruined by the hail.

26:57.695 --> 27:01.750
Next year black leg got my cow and pig
that I'd spent all my savings for.

27:02.366 --> 27:04.388
My wife caught cold
and she died.

27:04.389 --> 27:09.306
Two years later, one of my kids, the boy...
He died from spring sickness.

27:10.457 --> 27:12.618
Maybe I lost them both,
my woman and my kid...

27:12.619 --> 27:14.882
because I didn't have
no money for doctoring.

27:15.826 --> 27:18.620
And here I am with a farm...
a good one...

27:18.621 --> 27:20.951
belongs all to me
and worth lots of money.

27:21.856 --> 27:24.265
Only, I can't forget what it cost me.

27:25.827 --> 27:29.255
So when I see young folk like you
with their proudness...

27:29.640 --> 27:32.344
noses stuck in the air...
just makes me laugh!

27:35.215 --> 27:37.705
Well... much obliged for the water,

27:38.894 --> 27:40.373
And good luck with your fishhook.

27:51.852 --> 27:52.945
Hey... Finlay...

27:53.442 --> 27:55.970
What's that big old fishhook
you uncle's fixing up there?

27:55.971 --> 27:57.320
Is there a whale in this river?

27:57.321 --> 27:58.386
That's for "Lead Pencil".

27:58.387 --> 27:59.867
"Lead Pencil"... what's that?

27:59.868 --> 28:02.406
A catfish... he's got 2 whiskers
like lead pencils.

28:02.407 --> 28:04.367
Biggest durned catfish
you ever seen in the river.

28:05.301 --> 28:06.780
Hey! get that washing away Finlay!

29:21.437 --> 29:22.621
Nothin'?

29:25.043 --> 29:26.255
Must be the wind.

29:26.256 --> 29:27.958
It's more the time.

29:27.959 --> 29:31.787
For days now the moon has been moving
closer and closer to the North Star...

29:32.387 --> 29:34.629
The animals don't like that...
they hide out.

29:35.575 --> 29:38.612
It's crazy to go against the signs,
but what can you do?

29:38.613 --> 29:40.202
We gotta get fresh food.

29:42.967 --> 29:45.617
Daisy, honey... why don't
you and Sonny get into bed.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.394
Nice and warm there.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.739
Did you have a nice day at school?

30:06.091 --> 30:07.166
She didn't go, Sam.

30:07.653 --> 30:08.618
Why not?

30:09.787 --> 30:13.906
It's too cold... she ain't got no coat...
She'll catch her death of cold.

30:16.460 --> 30:18.912
But they just gotta go to school.

30:18.913 --> 30:23.185
Just because we're having hard times right
now doesn't mean we gotta stop nothing.

30:23.186 --> 30:24.705
We gotta keep going.

30:24.706 --> 30:29.706
Once we give up we won't have the courage
to get back to the good time.

30:31.648 --> 30:34.565
As I see it... ain't gonna have
no dinner again tonight.

30:37.138 --> 30:38.982
Never you mind, Granny.

30:38.983 --> 30:41.875
For breakfast we'll have a nice big bowl
of cornmeal mush.

30:44.271 --> 30:48.882
You'll all look down on my cold dead face
in that county pine box.

30:48.883 --> 30:49.952
You'll be sorry then.

30:50.249 --> 30:50.993
Maybe.

30:52.749 --> 30:55.181
You keep on promisin', Granny!

30:55.182 --> 30:57.571
You don't never deliver the goods!

30:57.572 --> 30:59.688
Hush your mouth!
You can't talk to me like that!

30:59.689 --> 31:00.849
You ain't even a real Tucker!

31:01.316 --> 31:02.986
Well, you ain't either!

31:03.076 --> 31:03.920
Hey... Honey!

31:06.470 --> 31:08.046
Daisy's got to be coated.

31:11.778 --> 31:12.851
They gotta go to school.

31:13.111 --> 31:15.526
Don't you take my blanket, Sam!
Don't you touch my blanket!

31:16.654 --> 31:19.534
Sam Tucker... you take one bit
of my best blanket, you'll get punished...

31:19.652 --> 31:23.058
Granny, ain't you got no heart...?
You want Daisy to catch her death?

31:23.257 --> 31:25.014
There'll be enough blanket
to keep you warm.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.278
I like it big!

31:26.371 --> 31:27.948
Curse you, Sam Tucker!

31:27.979 --> 31:29.858
My big blanket!
Curse you!

31:30.187 --> 31:30.955
Granny!

31:33.442 --> 31:35.104
Sam Tucker's the boss here...

31:35.105 --> 31:36.828
He can cut up whatever he likes.

31:36.829 --> 31:38.045
He's the boss!

31:38.046 --> 31:39.251
You hear me?

31:43.697 --> 31:45.780
Oh, Granny!

31:45.973 --> 31:48.456
Now don't take on so!

31:51.588 --> 31:54.373
Look, I think I know where
there's a nice swarm of wild bees...

31:54.473 --> 31:57.167
Maybe tomorrow I'll go out
and get you some honey!

31:57.168 --> 31:58.740
Maybe.

31:58.741 --> 31:59.828
Why me?

32:01.219 --> 32:04.922
Why me? I don't care for folks comin',
and helpin' yourselves, you know.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.821
Now don't you worry!
I'll get your honey.

32:11.811 --> 32:12.845
Nony...

32:13.334 --> 32:16.513
You know I guess you're
a right good Tucker after all.

32:18.505 --> 32:20.045
That Sam of yours...

32:20.594 --> 32:23.798
He's 'most as good a man
as my Fayette!

32:42.599 --> 32:44.080
My best blanket!

33:53.304 --> 33:57.940
Yessir, that carcase of yours
is sure gonna make 4 more Tuckers happy.

33:59.157 --> 34:00.902
C'mon Zoom!

34:16.255 --> 34:18.447
Yes sir, you're hide 'll
just about bring the

34:18.460 --> 34:20.614
price of a pair of silk
stockings for mama.

34:21.568 --> 34:22.969
Nice and shiny!

34:40.687 --> 34:42.762
Reckon we can eat now, folks!

34:52.270 --> 34:54.286
Easy!... You'll all get your share!

34:54.288 --> 34:57.237
Hold on, everybody...
there's gonna be a blessing.

34:59.481 --> 35:00.653
Much obliged, Lord...

35:00.654 --> 35:03.355
Looks like the Tuckers are gonna
make the grade after all.

35:04.629 --> 35:05.680
Amen.

35:05.994 --> 35:06.694
Granny!

35:09.490 --> 35:12.081
Granny gets the first,
because she's the eldest.

35:20.313 --> 35:23.219
I'd taken the Lord to be a stranger
in this house!

35:25.235 --> 35:27.190
Then comes Jotty,
coz he's the littlest.

35:31.632 --> 35:34.164
Then comes Papa
coz he caught this possum.

35:40.467 --> 35:43.717
And this one's for Zoomy...

35:43.718 --> 35:45.110
Because he helped him.

35:49.392 --> 35:52.965
And last of all, Daisy and me...
coz we're the womenfolk.

35:52.966 --> 35:57.340
At school they say this kinda food's
bad for you all the time.

36:02.805 --> 36:04.976
They say you gotta eat vegetables.

36:05.291 --> 36:06.945
Too much meat's bad.

36:06.946 --> 36:08.416
Vegetables in winter?

36:08.859 --> 36:09.795
If you don't...

36:10.748 --> 36:13.244
they say you get pellagra.

36:13.759 --> 36:15.570
That must be the 'spring sickness', Sam.

36:17.679 --> 36:19.905
Why, it's vegetables
that causes 'spring sickness'.

36:20.471 --> 36:22.898
That's when you get it... 'long about
the time you start eating vegetables.

36:23.164 --> 36:26.090
I oughta know... I lost
three o' mine from it.

36:26.511 --> 36:28.942
Their Uncle Walter...
Aunt Beck and Sue.

36:29.403 --> 36:31.435
And not one was over 6!

36:33.378 --> 36:34.441
Shucks... look at THEM.

36:35.076 --> 36:37.716
And anything a body likes as good as that,
couldn't be bad for 'em.

36:38.877 --> 36:40.617
Ain't that true, Nona?

36:40.618 --> 36:41.921
That's right, Sam.

38:50.588 --> 38:52.755
We done all that ourself.

38:53.947 --> 38:56.025
Just kept workin' and pluggin' away...

38:56.774 --> 38:58.379
By gosh, we done good.

38:59.416 --> 39:02.880
Before long now we can start plantin'
our cotton roundabout the twentieth.

39:03.619 --> 39:05.752
Then that crop will really get started.

39:30.529 --> 39:32.023
Hold that for me, will you.

39:40.142 --> 39:44.113
You see those little green woolly worms
fallin' outta that tree... ten a minute?

39:44.114 --> 39:46.963
They're all drifting down together
in the same place.

39:46.964 --> 39:50.207
And some folk might think
that they're what "Lead Pencil" is after.

39:50.644 --> 39:51.699
But they'd be wrong.

39:51.700 --> 39:53.579
Coz he's after somethin' else!

39:53.580 --> 39:55.733
He ain't interested in no worms.

39:55.734 --> 39:57.797
Old "Lead" is a pretty smart old guy.

39:57.798 --> 40:00.140
Wouldn't hardly live to be
as old as he is, if he wasn't.

40:01.374 --> 40:03.378
I'll bet you old "Lead"
waits for his dinner

40:03.391 --> 40:05.138
right over yonder at
that there drift.

40:05.763 --> 40:07.766
It's like a trap, on the river bottom.

40:08.354 --> 40:10.970
Is "Lead Pencil" older than Granny, Papa?

40:10.971 --> 40:12.528
Yeah... he's older than Granny.

40:13.209 --> 40:18.788
Yessir, it must be yonder, old
"Lead Pencil" has got his cubby.

40:23.608 --> 40:24.873
Gimme that, Honey.

41:37.181 --> 41:38.215
Sam!

41:38.216 --> 41:39.466
Nony!

41:40.950 --> 41:42.844
You got to come here quick!

41:42.845 --> 41:44.166
What are you sayin', Granny?

41:44.991 --> 41:45.936
Jot's ailin'...

41:46.506 --> 41:48.744
I reckon he's got the Spring Sickness!

41:49.395 --> 41:50.164
Spring Sickness?!

41:50.165 --> 41:51.822
How do you know?

41:52.595 --> 41:54.993
I am sayin' it's Spring Sickness!

41:56.149 --> 41:58.435
Who'd know better 'n me?...
Already lost 3 from it.

42:21.724 --> 42:22.659
Sam...

42:24.438 --> 42:25.819
I'm afraid!

42:37.962 --> 42:40.186
I didn't see no reason
to bother you, Doctor...

42:41.439 --> 42:42.869
It was just that little sore.

42:43.948 --> 42:45.730
Sonny ain't ever been sick.

42:46.304 --> 42:47.592
When it grew and grew...

42:47.593 --> 42:50.924
And now it seems like
it's just plum gonna possess him...

42:53.292 --> 42:57.021
You see Doctor... it's like some evil
crawlin' worm eatin' up my baby!

42:58.122 --> 43:00.962
I can't stand to watch it
no longer, Doctor!

43:00.963 --> 43:03.566
You gotta do somethin' to stop it!

43:16.279 --> 43:18.219
You don't have a cow, do you?

43:18.811 --> 43:19.717
No, Sir.

43:22.723 --> 43:25.154
Well, you better tell Sam to get one.

43:25.459 --> 43:26.809
How do we get a cow?

43:27.393 --> 43:28.530
Borrow one!

43:28.531 --> 43:31.970
Let Sam raise a heifer for somebody.

43:32.660 --> 43:34.648
Or borrow some milk, anyway.

43:34.649 --> 43:37.311
A pint a day...
or better still, a quart.

43:38.819 --> 43:41.479
Any neighbour with a cow
could spare you that.

43:41.480 --> 43:44.113
I'll try Doctor...
What medicine?

43:44.114 --> 43:45.217
Undress the boy.

43:50.395 --> 43:52.363
What vegetables
you been eatin' lately?

43:53.444 --> 43:56.663
Vegetables?...
Couldn't grow vegetables in winter.

43:56.664 --> 43:58.016
You got any money?

43:58.017 --> 43:59.966
Yes, Doctor... I got your $2.

44:00.502 --> 44:02.536
Sam's got $1.35 more...

44:03.246 --> 44:04.208
Keep it.

44:04.209 --> 44:07.102
Take all your money
and spend it all for vegetables.

44:07.103 --> 44:08.163
And get some lemons...

44:08.164 --> 44:10.537
Give him a glass of lemonade,
twice a day.

44:10.538 --> 44:12.475
And get that milk...!
Do you hear?

44:12.476 --> 44:15.014
If you don't give him milk
and vegetables...

44:15.015 --> 44:17.640
anything that I can do will be
just plum wasted.

44:18.196 --> 44:19.820
And with the milk and vegetables?

44:20.670 --> 44:22.072
I think he's got a chance.

44:39.014 --> 44:41.089
Thank you! Call again!

44:42.388 --> 44:45.206
Me... I know what war is.

44:45.885 --> 44:48.929
We was right close to Chateau Thierry
and the old colonel...

44:49.578 --> 44:52.754
He brung us all together, and said...

44:52.755 --> 44:56.922
Young man, in civilian life,
never brag about you conquests...

44:56.923 --> 44:59.520
- Whether they be love or war.
- Shut up, young fella!

44:59.521 --> 45:01.716
I'm tellin' ya... I know!

45:01.717 --> 45:03.090
And I know I know!

45:06.159 --> 45:07.284
Well, if it ain't Sam Tucker!

45:07.285 --> 45:08.791
Tim... when did you get in town?

45:08.792 --> 45:11.817
- How much for these here pipe cleaners?
- 10 cents, for you.

45:11.818 --> 45:14.900
Has it gone up?
Used to be a nickel?

45:14.901 --> 45:18.361
No ma'am... Old Zeke 'll be
mighty pleased with 'em, ma'am

45:19.072 --> 45:21.284
Tim just came back to show off
his city clothes.

45:22.031 --> 45:23.167
Take a look at that fancy tie!

45:23.168 --> 45:26.297
Seems like in the city, dollars grow faster
than beans in the field!

45:26.298 --> 45:27.660
Don't bet on it!

45:28.017 --> 45:29.613
Hey, I been lookin' all over for you...

45:29.614 --> 45:32.292
Let's go over to Seamen's and I'll buy
you some beer and tell you all about it.

45:32.316 --> 45:34.356
Brother, I'm with you any time
you'll buy me a beer.

45:34.409 --> 45:36.275
Well Harmie... Nona and Jotty
are over at Doc Whites...

45:36.305 --> 45:38.330
When they come over tell them
I'll be back in a minute, will you?

45:38.600 --> 45:43.044
Yeah... I know what a minute means, when
you're drinkin' beer with old Timmy there.

45:43.496 --> 45:45.262
How much for this pair of garters?

45:45.263 --> 45:47.559
You said Nona and Jotty's
over at Doc White's?

45:48.223 --> 45:49.138
Yeah.

45:49.139 --> 45:50.433
What's wrong, Sam?

45:50.434 --> 45:51.550
Jotty's ailin'.

45:51.942 --> 45:53.385
Ran into this Spring Sickness.

45:54.603 --> 45:58.395
Poor Nona... with a sick kid
she don't hardly get a wink of sleep.

45:58.396 --> 45:59.561
That's tough, man.

45:59.562 --> 46:01.960
My ma came out to my place
yesterday, to help.

46:02.677 --> 46:04.136
Harmie brought her out in his truck.

46:05.274 --> 46:06.488
That's kind of a relief.

46:16.408 --> 46:17.269
Slow down!

46:25.975 --> 46:28.074
Would you be interested in coming
and work in the factory with me?

46:28.075 --> 46:30.226
Are you crazy?
What would I do in a factory?

46:30.227 --> 46:31.245
I'm a farmer.

46:31.246 --> 46:34.097
Well, they just opened a new plant
and they're just cryin' for men.

46:34.098 --> 46:35.821
Don't even have to be skilled.

46:35.822 --> 46:38.760
I know the foreman...
I can get you in a minute.

46:39.036 --> 46:40.088
Pay much?

46:40.089 --> 46:42.003
Seven bucks a day!

46:43.862 --> 46:44.871
Seven bucks a day!?

46:50.063 --> 46:51.800
Howdy gents... what'll it be?

46:51.901 --> 46:52.882
Ain't you new here?

46:52.883 --> 46:53.639
What'll it be?

46:53.640 --> 46:55.875
OK, big-shot...
2 bottles of beer.

46:55.876 --> 46:58.329
Sure is hot in here...
what about a beer for me?

46:58.330 --> 46:59.656
I'm mighty thirsty.

46:59.657 --> 47:02.456
Why don't you ask your papa here...
He gets it wholesale.

47:02.457 --> 47:05.060
Oh, him! This ain't one of his good days.

47:05.061 --> 47:07.317
Must've got out of bed
on the wrong side!

47:08.707 --> 47:10.136
Well I got out on the right side...

47:10.137 --> 47:11.587
Bartender... another beer.

47:12.272 --> 47:15.216
Handsome... ain't I seen you
some place before?

47:16.334 --> 47:17.678
Nuh... what'd you say?

47:17.679 --> 47:19.961
I asked you... ain't I ever seen you
some place before?

47:19.962 --> 47:21.557
Could be... I don't know.

47:22.499 --> 47:23.843
You in town all alone?

47:23.844 --> 47:24.858
Oh, no ma'am...

47:24.859 --> 47:26.443
Like you see, I'm with my friend here...

47:26.444 --> 47:28.573
And my wife's waitin' for me
at Harmie's store.

47:28.574 --> 47:30.883
- So you got a wife?
- Yep... I got a wife.

47:31.841 --> 47:34.785
There's some that got wives
and they're still nice and... friendly.

47:34.786 --> 47:37.202
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I was studyin' about somethin'.

47:37.203 --> 47:39.731
Let's go down the end of the bar, pal...
we can't talk here.

47:40.306 --> 47:41.286
Excuse me, ma'am.

47:43.615 --> 47:46.214
I ain't got no wife waitin' for me, baby...
How about a date tonight?

47:46.215 --> 47:47.668
You big pig!

47:47.669 --> 47:49.639
You know what you can do
with your date.

47:49.640 --> 47:52.576
OK... OK, baby...
We'll talk about it later.

47:59.705 --> 48:01.041
To your kid, Sam!

48:03.990 --> 48:05.367
Seven bucks a day, eh?

48:06.090 --> 48:07.375
So it's "yes"... you'll come?

48:07.376 --> 48:09.111
Don't rightly see how I can, Tim...

48:09.112 --> 48:10.471
I made a deal with Ruston...

48:10.472 --> 48:12.786
I already got some credit
from his commissary.

48:12.787 --> 48:15.402
At $7 a day it wouldn't take you long
to pay him back.

48:15.403 --> 48:16.738
Yeah, but I'm tellin' you Tim...

48:16.739 --> 48:19.146
This is the first time I been able
to farm my own crop...

48:19.147 --> 48:20.809
Just like I always wanted to.

48:20.810 --> 48:23.128
Ain't somethin' I can give up,
just like that.

48:23.129 --> 48:24.824
Well, how much can you get
on your credit.

48:25.438 --> 48:27.382
Man, with that there ground I got...

48:27.383 --> 48:29.338
it'll be the finest crop
in the country.

48:29.339 --> 48:31.492
What does that mean...
"The finest crop in the country"...?

48:31.493 --> 48:33.981
With any luck at all I can make
2 bales an acre.

48:33.982 --> 48:35.713
How much does that make for you?

48:35.714 --> 48:36.699
More 'n 50 bales.

48:36.700 --> 48:38.153
No, I mean how much money?

48:38.154 --> 48:41.030
Do you know that on that ground
that I been workin' on now...

48:41.031 --> 48:45.284
Old man Corinth made a fortune
in the last cotton boom... a real fortune.

48:45.285 --> 48:47.052
So that's the idea!

48:47.053 --> 48:49.366
All you farmers is just the same...

48:49.367 --> 48:50.583
Gamblers!

48:50.584 --> 48:52.436
That's what you all are...
to a man.

48:52.437 --> 48:55.245
Year after year
you starve yourself to death...

48:55.246 --> 48:56.862
and hope that some fine day...

48:58.642 --> 49:00.169
Well... I think you're loco!

49:00.846 --> 49:02.516
Me, I'd rather be safe, first.

49:02.517 --> 49:04.894
Me... I'd rather work in my field.

49:04.895 --> 49:08.426
I feel better that way...
I feel more free.

49:08.427 --> 49:10.048
Free?... Free?

49:10.049 --> 49:12.989
Man, with money in your pocket,
you're as free as the wind.

49:14.401 --> 49:16.585
With this... you want a good meal...
you go to a restaurant.

49:16.586 --> 49:18.238
Good room... you go to a hotel.

49:18.239 --> 49:20.141
All you gotta do
is flash your greenback...

49:20.142 --> 49:21.420
You get anything you want.

49:23.040 --> 49:25.976
You call that free,
sweatin' from mornin' 'til night?

49:25.977 --> 49:28.161
In the bakin' hot sun,
workin' in them fields!

49:29.050 --> 49:31.249
Oh, I'll allow as how
it's sometimes pretty hard.

49:31.668 --> 49:34.807
What I mean is, being able
to decide things for myself...

49:35.350 --> 49:37.904
To know I can choose my
own time about plantin'

49:37.917 --> 49:40.000
and ploughin' and
harvestin' the crop.

49:40.001 --> 49:43.849
That I can do it all in my own way...
and don't have to answer to nobody.

49:44.278 --> 49:46.916
I mean for me alone
being accountable for it.

49:46.917 --> 49:51.193
Whether the weevils strip you clean...
or you get the best price.

49:52.124 --> 49:54.086
Instead of all that baloney...
that means no?

49:55.043 --> 49:56.223
Afraid so, Tim.

49:56.224 --> 49:59.032
Well, pal... I think you're
makin' a big mistake.

50:00.814 --> 50:02.849
Hey, bartender... where's my other $4?

50:03.380 --> 50:04.109
What $4?

50:04.110 --> 50:05.698
I gave you a $5 bill.

50:05.699 --> 50:08.799
Oh, no... Lizzy... you seen that was a $1.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.087
Of course I did.

50:13.623 --> 50:16.106
And the pretty boy
who's goin' home to his wife...

50:16.107 --> 50:17.436
He seen it, too.

50:17.437 --> 50:21.051
Well I'll be doggoned!
So that's how it is!

50:21.674 --> 50:23.505
Nothing but a hicky old farmer...

50:23.506 --> 50:26.335
and yet the girls fall for you
like a ton of bricks!

50:26.879 --> 50:30.368
What the heck have you got
that I can't buy with my dough?

50:33.955 --> 50:37.581
Give me my $4, you big double-jointed son
of a skunk, or I'll tear this joint apart!

50:37.634 --> 50:38.856
Outside!

50:39.156 --> 50:42.315
OK brother... but I hope it's gonna
be worth the $4 to you.

50:48.616 --> 50:49.386
What do you aim to do?

50:49.387 --> 50:51.567
I ain't asking you to help, Sam...
you got a family.

50:52.134 --> 50:53.677
I wouldn't start any more trouble, Tim.

50:53.678 --> 50:54.694
Don't stay here, Sam.

50:54.695 --> 50:56.830
This'd have to cost you
more than $4.

50:56.831 --> 50:59.048
I'm asking you as a
friend not to stay here.

52:50.265 --> 52:52.645
Milk and greens...

52:57.546 --> 53:00.072
That doctor man done said about Jotty.

53:01.866 --> 53:04.377
I'd like to see some of them
damn vegetables to grow.

53:06.289 --> 53:08.716
Where he figure we're gonna
get that there milk from.

53:10.304 --> 53:12.166
Out of the sky... just like that!

53:24.127 --> 53:27.606
Seems like Sam ain't the only
pig-headed one around here.

53:28.487 --> 53:30.511
That ma of his!...

53:30.512 --> 53:34.412
Thinks she can cure the Spring Sickness
with fresh air!

53:36.636 --> 53:38.937
A widow-lady her age
ought to have better sense.

53:39.452 --> 53:44.653
Me? I say that baby 'll just catch
its death in this here wind!

53:49.862 --> 53:51.619
I'm gonna get that milk.

53:54.885 --> 53:56.550
Poor Sam!

53:58.003 --> 54:00.809
Men in this here Tucker family
just ain't strong.

54:03.769 --> 54:05.689
No sir... it's just like
I told you Tucker...

54:05.690 --> 54:07.038
I don't need no extra help.

54:08.140 --> 54:10.133
I got Finlay and my girl Becky.

54:11.306 --> 54:14.304
Too bad about your boy...
I know how what that is...

54:14.305 --> 54:15.823
Sick kid is pretty sorrowful.

54:16.614 --> 54:18.013
Pitch it in Becky!

54:23.589 --> 54:27.204
Like I told you before, it's wrong for
a man to get too big for his breeches.

54:27.789 --> 54:30.094
When you got no money,
you work for them what's got it...

54:30.095 --> 54:31.199
That there's the rule.

54:33.040 --> 54:35.903
Why don't you go back to Ruston...
get your 6 bits a day...

54:36.687 --> 54:38.186
Some milk for your chap...

54:38.187 --> 54:39.681
and maybe some doctor, even.

54:40.657 --> 54:43.568
About the milk, like you see,
I can't rightly spare a drop.

54:44.040 --> 54:47.076
Me? I got no milk for m'self...
It's all for the pigs.

54:47.077 --> 54:48.356
Pour the rest in, Becky.

54:48.357 --> 54:50.390
Finlay... bring the drain.

54:55.312 --> 54:58.493
Your cotton? Coming along?
Not too many bugs?

54:58.494 --> 55:00.267
I seen you the other day in field...

55:00.268 --> 55:02.790
You were shavin' the cotton
so close to the ground with the plough...

55:02.791 --> 55:03.818
You scared me!

55:03.819 --> 55:06.381
Still that's the best way
to get rid of the bugs...

55:06.382 --> 55:08.734
Rolls 'em right out in the sun...
The heat kills 'em...

55:08.735 --> 55:10.021
Better than any poison!

55:10.022 --> 55:12.840
But you gotta have a good eye
and a steady hand.

55:12.841 --> 55:15.669
You're a good worker alright, Tucker.

55:15.670 --> 55:18.170
If I was you,
I wouldn't think twice...

55:18.171 --> 55:20.208
I'd go back to work for Ruston.

55:20.209 --> 55:23.512
If I wanted to give up,
I wouldn't have to go back to Ruston.

55:23.513 --> 55:25.629
Got somethin' better?

55:25.630 --> 55:27.116
Yeah... lots better.

55:28.059 --> 55:29.683
But like I already done told you...

55:29.684 --> 55:32.383
I want to grow my own crop...
and I aim to do it.

55:32.384 --> 55:34.180
Well, if you're so sure of yourself...

55:34.181 --> 55:36.917
why are you always coming around
asking your neighbours for help?

55:37.190 --> 55:38.762
I never asked you for anything.

55:39.722 --> 55:43.787
Likely, some old-fashioned idea
I had about neighbourliness...

55:47.026 --> 55:48.763
Take good care of them pigs.

55:48.798 --> 55:50.573
That's sure what I'm gonna do.

55:50.608 --> 55:53.743
See that that black hog eats
all his dinner, do you hear?

55:55.479 --> 55:57.145
So long, Devers.

56:07.543 --> 56:08.986
Sam! Sam!

56:16.167 --> 56:18.408
Here... take this...
It's for Jotty.

56:18.635 --> 56:19.435
Thanks, Becky.

56:19.611 --> 56:21.508
I can get you some more
if you want some more.

56:21.509 --> 56:22.877
My daddy won't have to see.

56:23.126 --> 56:24.082
I'm much obliged, Becky...

56:24.168 --> 56:26.469
and I'll take it, coz my
boy's really bad off.

56:26.612 --> 56:27.572
But I'll pay you for it.

56:27.864 --> 56:30.343
Becky... I seen ya...
I seen what ya done!

56:30.344 --> 56:32.586
I feel just like breakin'
somebody's neck today.

56:32.587 --> 56:34.261
I'm gonna tell your pa
you was stealin' his milk!

56:34.262 --> 56:37.342
I knowed you was hackin' after this
fella... I saw you lookin' at him, before.

56:37.505 --> 56:38.425
I'm gonna tell your pa!

56:39.185 --> 56:40.770
What did you do that for?!

56:40.771 --> 56:43.064
I'm never going to speak to you again.

56:43.065 --> 56:44.791
If I see you talkin' to HIM again...
you'll be sorry!

56:44.792 --> 56:45.850
Yes, Finlay?

56:48.118 --> 56:51.883
Don't fret, Becky...
You're a good gal.

56:51.884 --> 56:52.960
Thanks just the same.

57:26.547 --> 57:27.408
Honey...

57:40.261 --> 57:41.296
Nona...

57:45.594 --> 57:48.596
Nona...

57:48.597 --> 57:51.060
I can't listen to him cry no more!

58:29.925 --> 58:33.794
Oh Lord, how come you put the sky up there
and this old mud down here.

58:33.795 --> 58:37.389
Made it so purdy if You didn't want us
to work it... to love it...

58:38.774 --> 58:40.574
Do You want me to give all this up?

58:40.575 --> 58:44.009
Move in town with Tim
and work with him in a factory...

58:44.010 --> 58:47.042
Under a roof as high as your sky...
and puts out your light?

58:48.159 --> 58:50.066
Tell me Lord... help me to know.

59:16.787 --> 59:19.465
How are you lady?
Did you have a good trip?

59:19.466 --> 59:21.333
She had a fine trip...
She's a wonderful old girl.

59:21.334 --> 59:22.315
Did you have a good trip, Timmy?

59:22.316 --> 59:25.166
You know Harmie, a cow's the only thing
I left in the country...

59:25.167 --> 59:26.302
that I miss in the city.

59:26.303 --> 59:31.507
Believe me that sweet old gal is a lot
gentler than that Lizzy at the saloon.

59:31.508 --> 59:33.427
Harmie, can milk the cow now?

59:33.428 --> 59:34.612
Of course you can.

59:40.822 --> 59:42.138
That Harmie!

59:43.191 --> 59:46.940
He'll come waggin' in here one of
these days with a boa constrictor.

59:46.941 --> 59:49.375
I wouldn't be one mite surprised.

01:00:11.181 --> 01:00:15.255
I'm gonna call her...
"Uncle Walter".

01:01:33.833 --> 01:01:35.644
Our vegetable garden!

01:01:35.645 --> 01:01:37.325
That's Finlay... and them's Devers cattle!

01:02:26.316 --> 01:02:28.550
Oh, Jotty!

01:02:37.704 --> 01:02:39.104
You go on back in the house, Honey.

01:02:40.631 --> 01:02:42.427
Go on back in the house.

01:02:54.518 --> 01:02:56.031
Finlay! What do you know about this?

01:02:56.032 --> 01:02:56.989
I don't know nothin'!

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.606
I didn't do it!

01:02:58.607 --> 01:03:00.667
No... not by yourself...
but we both know who did!

01:03:00.668 --> 01:03:02.249
C'mon... we're goin' to your place.

01:03:16.856 --> 01:03:18.180
Devers... look at me...
Why did you do it?

01:03:18.181 --> 01:03:20.542
What you mean why did I do it?
You can't prove nothin'...

01:03:20.543 --> 01:03:22.198
The Law 'd call it an Act of God!

01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:24.851
As for your garden...
you can plant it again, can't you?

01:03:24.852 --> 01:03:25.841
Plant it again!?

01:03:25.842 --> 01:03:27.697
Or did you come to borrow some seed?!

01:03:27.698 --> 01:03:28.469
I wouldn't borrow...

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:29.408
Wait a minute!

01:03:32.111 --> 01:03:33.196
This rope's plumb ruined...

01:03:33.197 --> 01:03:36.055
Remember what we agreed on
when you first come and asked for water?

01:03:36.376 --> 01:03:38.776
Yeah... about replacin' it...
It's time for you to do it now...

01:03:38.777 --> 01:03:40.542
I don't aim to use this one no more.

01:03:40.543 --> 01:03:43.823
And I'm sick and tired of you
comin' around askin' for water.

01:03:44.669 --> 01:03:47.017
And now Devers,
I'm gonna break your neck!

01:03:51.818 --> 01:03:54.404
I'm mighty glad you started this, Tucker.

01:03:55.605 --> 01:03:57.382
Specially with Finlay here
as a witness.

01:03:59.297 --> 01:04:01.389
That makes two of us
can talk to the law.

01:04:50.996 --> 01:04:52.238
Pa... don't!

01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:56.558
Shut your mouth...
Get back in the house!

01:05:27.766 --> 01:05:29.344
You'd like to see me leave here,
wouldn't you?

01:05:29.345 --> 01:05:30.111
Yeah!

01:05:30.112 --> 01:05:31.598
- Why?
- Course I would!

01:05:31.599 --> 01:05:32.686
What did I ever do to you?

01:05:32.687 --> 01:05:34.967
Like I told you first time
you come to ask for water...

01:05:35.615 --> 01:05:38.279
Just don't like to see folks
tryin' to be better than they are.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:41.532
This world has got to be them that
gives orders and them that takes 'em.

01:05:41.533 --> 01:05:44.351
And you figure it's you to give 'em
and me to take 'em... That right?

01:05:44.352 --> 01:05:45.149
Why?

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.882
Coz I worked hard... all my life.

01:05:46.883 --> 01:05:48.579
I worked hard too...
You know that!

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.494
Why here, and not someplace else?

01:05:50.495 --> 01:05:53.179
Before you come,
I was alone in this place...

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:54.474
Everything was mine!

01:05:54.475 --> 01:05:57.277
I was figuring on buying your farm...
It was cheaper then.

01:05:57.278 --> 01:06:01.073
Now, if things goes on like this,
everything's going to be yours.

01:06:01.074 --> 01:06:03.778
All I ever see is you...
everywhere I go!

01:06:03.779 --> 01:06:07.403
In the woods... killin' the varmints...
at the river, catching the fish.

01:06:07.404 --> 01:06:11.423
Even Finlay told me...
you set a line for "Lead Pencil".

01:06:11.424 --> 01:06:14.022
And my girl Becky...
You heard what she said!

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:15.384
Sam!... Sam!

01:06:30.032 --> 01:06:31.104
Sam...

01:06:31.105 --> 01:06:34.588
Sam... you better take care
of that cut.

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:39.427
Go on back in the house, Becky...
you best not bother about me anymore.

01:06:51.438 --> 01:06:52.403
Finlay!

01:06:54.464 --> 01:06:55.643
Get my gun!

01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:14.511
Uncle Henry!

01:07:16.404 --> 01:07:18.118
Shut your mouth!

01:08:00.204 --> 01:08:01.193
Holy smokes!

01:08:02.269 --> 01:08:03.228
It's "Lead Pencil"!

01:08:31.935 --> 01:08:32.778
Can I help you?

01:08:32.779 --> 01:08:34.406
You can grab hold of that line.

01:08:44.163 --> 01:08:48.229
Finlay, you was right...
His whiskers is as big as lead pencils.

01:08:50.035 --> 01:08:51.169
Tucker...

01:08:52.608 --> 01:08:53.484
That's my fish.

01:08:54.654 --> 01:08:56.099
So you own the river, too, eh?

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:59.375
Well, maybe the law will call
my hook and line an Act of God.

01:08:59.376 --> 01:09:02.268
You give me the fish and swear
never to say you caught it...

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:04.685
I'll give you a dollar.

01:09:05.283 --> 01:09:07.683
I don't want your dollar...
My folks likes fish.

01:09:08.437 --> 01:09:11.036
Well, alright... let me take it
and keep it for a day or two...

01:09:11.037 --> 01:09:12.413
..and show it at the store... and...

01:09:12.415 --> 01:09:14.206
Then you can have it back.

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:17.274
Folks likes fresh fish, Devers.

01:09:18.859 --> 01:09:20.961
Well, let me take it, and...

01:09:22.063 --> 01:09:23.796
You can use out of my garden.

01:09:27.776 --> 01:09:29.478
Well, you can have
the whole garden.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:33.749
The well rope...
How we gonna draw water?

01:09:34.999 --> 01:09:36.899
Oh... I got another rope
in the barn.

01:09:36.901 --> 01:09:39.368
What happened, Sam?
Becky told me...

01:09:39.368 --> 01:09:40.354
It ain't nothin'...

01:09:40.356 --> 01:09:43.656
I was just helpin' Devers pull
this big old catfish out of the river.

01:09:43.657 --> 01:09:45.634
He done caught "Lead Pencil".

01:10:09.152 --> 01:10:10.458
We forgot to tell you.

01:10:10.459 --> 01:10:12.507
Yeah... we plum forgot!

01:10:14.164 --> 01:10:15.129
You tell 'em, Harmie.

01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:18.635
Well... we're gonna get married, Sunday...

01:10:20.053 --> 01:10:22.423
I was just thinkin'
how blessed the Tuckers is...

01:10:22.424 --> 01:10:24.281
and I can't help wonderin' why.

01:10:25.329 --> 01:10:26.914
I get the man I want...

01:10:32.230 --> 01:10:33.594
Here we are... all together...

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:36.539
Jotty's cured and happy
once more...

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.414
Daisy's so good at her book learnin',
she's gonna get a prize at school...

01:10:44.698 --> 01:10:46.915
Sam's growed the best crop
in the county.

01:10:46.916 --> 01:10:50.868
Maybe even gonna buy his own place,
that's what he makes off on it.

01:10:53.571 --> 01:10:58.022
I keep studyin' why Almighty
blessed us Tuckers so generous.

01:10:58.727 --> 01:10:59.862
But I reckon I know.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.160
Coz of Sam, and the way
he worked that farm o' his...

01:11:04.235 --> 01:11:06.059
that crop he done growed

01:11:06.313 --> 01:11:08.464
He must be just where the Lord
wanted him to be.

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:09.514
You're sure right!

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:12.182
Only if Sam is like he is, it's because
he's got such a good ma!

01:11:13.385 --> 01:11:15.866
I can't think of nobody I'd rather have
than Harmie for my pa!

01:11:17.049 --> 01:11:19.818
He, son! You ain't a baby no more...
Leave your ma alone!

01:11:19.819 --> 01:11:20.706
She's mine now!

01:11:20.707 --> 01:11:22.200
Oh, she's yours is she?

01:11:22.201 --> 01:11:24.353
What do you think you are...
an Indian chief?

01:11:26.764 --> 01:11:28.252
Let me kiss the groom!

01:11:28.253 --> 01:11:31.494
These kids don't know anything...
they ain't had our experience.

01:11:32.174 --> 01:11:34.026
Hey, Harmie...
now that you're married...

01:11:34.027 --> 01:11:35.814
I suppose you'll be
going on the wagon, eh?

01:11:35.815 --> 01:11:39.618
I was just thinkin'...
I'd start that tomorrow.

01:11:40.483 --> 01:11:41.800
But it ain't tomorrow yet!

01:11:44.657 --> 01:11:45.805
Say Sam... c'mon!

01:11:45.806 --> 01:11:46.923
Come on everybody!

01:11:52.354 --> 01:11:53.846
When we get rich...

01:11:57.782 --> 01:11:59.738
When our ship comes in...

01:12:00.622 --> 01:12:04.368
I want us to get one of them
talking machines!

01:12:04.369 --> 01:12:06.211
And a lot o' sacred records.

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:13.415
I want sit on the gallery...
and drink lemonade with ice in it!

01:12:14.605 --> 01:12:17.462
And hear "Beulah Land", you know?

01:12:17.463 --> 01:12:19.915
<i>Sweet Beulah Land...</i>

01:12:19.916 --> 01:12:22.876
<i>Sweet Beulah Land...</i>

01:12:22.877 --> 01:12:27.134
<i>As on thy highest mount I stand,</i>

01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:30.164
<i>I look away across the sea,</i>

01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:31.591
Say Harmie...

01:12:31.592 --> 01:12:34.112
You sure you didn't catch cold, that night?

01:12:34.113 --> 01:12:36.353
Don't you know this is
just the stuff to keep you warm?!

01:12:37.084 --> 01:12:39.018
Hey Harmie...
weren't you afeard of the law?

01:12:39.119 --> 01:12:39.905
Are you kiddin'?...

01:12:39.906 --> 01:12:42.032
The law is right there, waitin'
for the finished product.

01:12:43.925 --> 01:12:46.379
Hey Sam... come on...
I want to show you somethin'.

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:50.302
<i>Rye whisky, rye whisky,
rye whisky I cry...</i>

01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:54.153
Don't worry, I've got us a third!

01:12:59.561 --> 01:13:00.573
It's real city-stuff, Sam...

01:13:00.574 --> 01:13:02.555
Same as they drink
in them hot-shot nightclubs.

01:13:02.556 --> 01:13:03.969
Lay your nose on that!

01:13:04.403 --> 01:13:06.051
Smell it, Sam... smell it!

01:13:07.233 --> 01:13:08.305
Ain't that somethin'!

01:13:08.776 --> 01:13:09.560
Sure is!

01:13:09.561 --> 01:13:10.645
3 bucks a quart!

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.620
We're gonna dance now, folks!

01:13:14.634 --> 01:13:16.987
Oh, I gotta find a good
hidin' place for this!

01:13:21.961 --> 01:13:23.244
Oh, there you are, Sam!...

01:13:23.245 --> 01:13:24.921
Come on honey...
you dance with me.

01:13:24.922 --> 01:13:26.931
No, you're very nice, ma'am...
but thanks just the same.

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:29.435
After the dance we could
go outside, honey...

01:13:29.436 --> 01:13:31.489
I got some mighty fine drinkin' whisky
in my car.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:33.125
Thank you ma'am,
but I got a partner.

01:13:34.670 --> 01:13:36.281
How about dancin' with me, honey-child?

01:13:36.282 --> 01:13:38.060
And after the dancin'
go out to your car?

01:13:38.061 --> 01:13:39.712
Well, I don't know about that!

01:13:39.713 --> 01:13:41.614
C'mon now... don't be like that.

01:13:45.768 --> 01:13:47.397
<i>Promenade single file...</i>

01:13:47.398 --> 01:13:49.137
<i>Ladies in the lead, that Indian style...</i>

01:13:49.138 --> 01:13:51.056
<i>Swing that girl behind you...</i>

01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:54.123
<i>Promenade single file...</i>

01:13:54.124 --> 01:13:55.726
<i>Ladies in the lead, that Indian style...</i>

01:13:55.727 --> 01:13:58.074
<i>Swing that girl behind you...</i>

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:01.306
<i>Swing that girl behind you...</i>

01:14:02.088 --> 01:14:04.031
<i>First and third lead to the right...</i>

01:14:04.032 --> 01:14:05.756
<i>Chase the rabbit, chase the squirrel...</i>

01:14:05.757 --> 01:14:07.307
<i>Chase that pretty girl 'round the world...</i>

01:14:07.308 --> 01:14:08.988
<i>Chase the possum, chase the coon...</i>

01:14:08.989 --> 01:14:11.005
<i>Chase that pretty boy round the moon...</i>

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.932
<i>Four hand up and around you go...</i>

01:14:13.933 --> 01:14:15.558
<i>Round and round and don't be slow...</i>

01:14:15.559 --> 01:14:17.195
<i>Away he's making a docey-doe...</i>

01:14:48.679 --> 01:14:49.839
C'mon... get in there, folks.

01:15:02.386 --> 01:15:03.572
Granny... mind what you're doin'...

01:15:03.573 --> 01:15:05.095
I got my bottle in there.

01:15:29.013 --> 01:15:30.366
Serves you right!

01:15:30.937 --> 01:15:32.757
Well, it cost me 3 bucks.

01:15:35.393 --> 01:15:37.453
Oh, so you think it's a joke, eh?

01:15:51.364 --> 01:15:52.364
The winner!

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:03.486
The winner!

01:16:50.508 --> 01:16:52.582
Best wedding I was ever at.

01:17:23.216 --> 01:17:25.802
It's raining. What's gonna happen
to our cotton?

01:17:29.710 --> 01:17:32.169
Sure is a bad time
for rain to come.

01:17:34.085 --> 01:17:35.741
Better get us all back inside.

01:17:36.355 --> 01:17:38.237
No good for us to get wet.

01:19:08.716 --> 01:19:09.510
Sam!

01:19:10.461 --> 01:19:11.462
Sam!

01:19:13.196 --> 01:19:14.571
Sam... wake up!

01:19:22.717 --> 01:19:24.542
We've got to go home!

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:14.168
Oh, Sam!

01:20:53.294 --> 01:20:55.619
I ain't gonna stay here
a minute longer.

01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:58.321
Not even a decent place to sit.

01:20:59.542 --> 01:21:04.741
I'm gonna take this old carcase direct
to the cemetery and await my Maker!

01:21:09.582 --> 01:21:12.619
I never thought you'd treat
your old granny like this!

01:21:13.968 --> 01:21:15.890
Sam Tucker...
You're a criminal!

01:21:27.692 --> 01:21:28.611
Granny!

01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:32.160
You stay here!

01:21:33.005 --> 01:21:34.765
Times like this,
folks got to stick together!

01:21:35.114 --> 01:21:37.341
You'll stay here
with the rest of us!

01:21:38.379 --> 01:21:39.222
Hey, Sam...

01:21:40.672 --> 01:21:42.624
Boy, it's good and ruined Tim.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.522
Well... gotta go find Uncle Walter.

01:21:51.247 --> 01:21:53.257
Alright... I'll stay...

01:21:53.258 --> 01:21:55.482
Coz you're trappin' me
like you always do!

01:21:55.998 --> 01:21:58.889
You're strong, and you're the boss.

01:21:59.842 --> 01:22:04.261
What can an old decrepit granny do
agin the likes o' you?

01:22:04.262 --> 01:22:07.494
Come on... back to the house...
we got work to do.

01:22:23.415 --> 01:22:24.766
Where do you reckon
she might be?

01:22:24.767 --> 01:22:27.436
Ain't no tellin...
But I just gotta find her, Tim.

01:22:28.272 --> 01:22:30.272
Pasture down there by the river
is all under water.

01:22:31.166 --> 01:22:32.323
Sure hope she ain't in that river...

01:22:32.324 --> 01:22:34.340
Ain't no cow worth gettin' drowned for.

01:22:35.219 --> 01:22:36.584
Not asking you to help, Tim.

01:22:38.185 --> 01:22:39.571
I'll go with you.

01:23:16.822 --> 01:23:17.961
There she is!

01:23:21.614 --> 01:23:23.215
I'll go over and get her.

01:23:23.216 --> 01:23:24.591
Why don't you wait
until the water goes down?

01:23:24.592 --> 01:23:25.845
The river'll never stop rising.

01:23:25.846 --> 01:23:27.165
OK boy, I'll give you a hand.

01:24:23.549 --> 01:24:24.667
OK?

01:24:24.668 --> 01:24:25.685
OK, boss.

01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:26.882
OK... I'm goin' on alone.

01:24:26.883 --> 01:24:28.880
Oh no... I'm goin' along with you.

01:24:28.881 --> 01:24:29.828
You'll stay here.

01:24:39.497 --> 01:24:40.978
Sam!...

01:24:48.033 --> 01:24:50.607
The current!... Help!

01:25:55.081 --> 01:25:56.841
- OK, Tim?
- OK, boy!

01:26:15.471 --> 01:26:17.475
I'm comin' to town with you, Tim.

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:20.857
Gather up my measly belongings
that's left...

01:26:20.858 --> 01:26:23.189
and pack up my whole bunch
and get out!

01:26:24.652 --> 01:26:26.352
All them fields and trees and the river...

01:26:26.353 --> 01:26:27.972
I just can't look at 'em no more!

01:26:27.973 --> 01:26:29.912
I give 'em everything
I had to give... honest!

01:26:29.913 --> 01:26:31.357
And what did they give me back?

01:26:31.358 --> 01:26:32.345
Nothing.

01:26:32.719 --> 01:26:34.586
Nothing but trouble and misery.

01:26:35.767 --> 01:26:37.290
Be crazy to stick any longer...

01:26:37.291 --> 01:26:38.703
A fella ought to know
when he's beat.

01:26:38.704 --> 01:26:40.054
When he ain't wanted on the place

01:26:40.055 --> 01:26:42.135
ain't nothin' for him to do
but to pack up and get out!

01:26:42.136 --> 01:26:44.442
Come on... let's go.

01:27:14.025 --> 01:27:15.383
Sam!

01:27:15.384 --> 01:27:18.391
I can hardly believe
the house is still standin'.

01:27:22.078 --> 01:27:25.257
Sam, your gun is safe...
and lots of other things, too.

01:27:25.972 --> 01:27:28.901
Most of Jotty's vegetable jars
are still whole.

01:27:28.902 --> 01:27:30.424
Of course, the pictures
got kind of broke...

01:27:30.425 --> 01:27:33.462
But once I get 'em hangin' straight
on the wall, they won't look so bad.

01:27:40.329 --> 01:27:42.702
Course, the worst thing of all
was the stovepipe...

01:27:42.703 --> 01:27:45.810
But I got it back up again,
and I think it'll work alright now.

01:27:46.622 --> 01:27:47.986
How do you like that, Sam?!

01:27:48.603 --> 01:27:50.420
I like it fine, Honey.

01:27:51.318 --> 01:27:52.193
Hey, Sam Tucker!...

01:27:52.194 --> 01:27:53.499
You know what this 'minds me of?

01:27:55.003 --> 01:27:58.680
'Minds me of 43 years ago,
with your grandpappy, Fayette.

01:27:58.681 --> 01:28:01.298
Same thing happened to us.

01:28:01.299 --> 01:28:02.793
Only worse... much worse.

01:28:04.321 --> 01:28:06.669
Our roof come clean to the floor, and...

01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:08.697
our walls just plum caved in.

01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:12.971
For a week we crawled in and out
on our hands and knees...

01:28:12.972 --> 01:28:14.892
like prey goin' down their holes.

01:28:15.795 --> 01:28:17.460
Oh, my fan!

01:28:21.007 --> 01:28:22.778
Old Fayette... he said...

01:28:23.326 --> 01:28:24.835
Never mind, Sugar...

01:28:24.836 --> 01:28:26.261
It could've been much worse...

01:28:26.262 --> 01:28:28.350
if the Indians attacked it!

01:28:45.241 --> 01:28:46.070
Sam...

01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:47.179
Yeah, what is it, Tim?

01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:49.924
You said you was comin' to town
with me.

01:28:51.265 --> 01:28:53.706
Yeah... yeah, I said it.

01:28:54.458 --> 01:28:56.665
You said it, but you ain't comin' now, eh?

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:58.907
I was so plum wore out for a while...

01:28:58.908 --> 01:29:01.025
I didn't seem to believe
in nothin' no more.

01:29:01.546 --> 01:29:03.237
But now my clothes are startin' to dry...

01:29:03.238 --> 01:29:04.478
I'm beginnin' to believe again.

01:29:05.254 --> 01:29:07.925
I guess that's the way the earth feels,
when she's wet.

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:10.368
But the sun'll start dryin' her out...

01:29:10.369 --> 01:29:13.809
And she'll start callin' to me again
just the way Nona does sometimes.

01:29:16.305 --> 01:29:18.773
I knowed it all along,
you'd never leave this place.

01:29:19.801 --> 01:29:22.525
If there was only one farmer
left on this earth...

01:29:22.526 --> 01:29:23.703
It'd be you.

01:29:24.205 --> 01:29:25.253
Crazy kiddin', Tim!

01:29:25.254 --> 01:29:28.075
Them machines o' yourn... they're fine...
I realise that.

01:29:28.076 --> 01:29:29.276
But you just can't eat 'em.

01:29:29.277 --> 01:29:33.088
Once in a while, you gotta have a
hunk 'o beef and a few ears o' corn

01:29:33.089 --> 01:29:34.738
to fill up your belly.

01:29:34.739 --> 01:29:37.000
Oh, you city folks are mighty smart...

01:29:37.001 --> 01:29:39.992
But I'm afraid without us farmers,
you'd get kinda skinny.

01:29:41.048 --> 01:29:43.964
And without us workers,
I just wonder what'd happen to you all.

01:29:44.828 --> 01:29:47.876
You're plough... sure didn't grow
on no tree.

01:29:47.877 --> 01:29:51.170
And your gun that you feed
your bunch with in the winter...

01:29:51.171 --> 01:29:53.629
You didn't plant no seeds to get that.

01:29:54.779 --> 01:29:57.026
Some day, like I hope
you get you a tractor.

01:29:57.091 --> 01:29:59.151
Where do you reckon that'll come from?

01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:04.430
Believe me, friend... it takes all kinds
to make up this whole world.

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:06.374
You love your farm.

01:30:07.171 --> 01:30:08.631
That's right. You stay.

01:30:08.632 --> 01:30:10.613
I like to work in a factory.

01:30:10.614 --> 01:30:13.586
And that's why I come
to take you back with me.

01:30:16.368 --> 01:30:18.485
Well... you know what I'm talkin' about.

01:30:18.486 --> 01:30:21.652
I don't mean no harm...
I'd just like to help you.

01:30:22.655 --> 01:30:25.188
Yeah... I know, Tim... thanks!

01:30:28.225 --> 01:30:29.886
Coffee's all ready!

01:30:39.935 --> 01:30:41.416
I want honey! I want honey!

01:30:41.417 --> 01:30:43.390
Boy, nothin' could taste better
than this!

01:30:43.882 --> 01:30:46.926
I think this is the first time you've made
anything out of that old pot

01:30:46.927 --> 01:30:48.422
that was fit to drink, Nony!

01:30:49.282 --> 01:30:50.745
Thank you, Granny!

01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:57.166
Thank you, Honey.

01:31:26.031 --> 01:31:28.111
Tomorrow I guess we'll be through
with the ploughin'.

01:31:30.146 --> 01:31:33.390
As if we ever get through
with the ploughing!

01:31:34.071 --> 01:31:38.824
I'm goin' back to the house, and just
sit... and wait for my call to glory.

01:31:44.134 --> 01:31:46.998
Yeah... spring's gonna come
a little early this year, Honey.

01:31:48.178 --> 01:31:51.181
Yeah, I reckon we can start our seedin'
even before the twentieth.
