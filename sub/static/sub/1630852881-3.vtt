WEBVTT

00:10.844 --> 00:12.054
Petey, are you okay?

00:17.768 --> 00:19.019
Petey?

00:19.102 --> 00:25.025
Yeah, I'm good. I just slipped.
You should invest in a bath mat, maybe.

00:25.108 --> 00:29.655
Yeah, okay.
The robe is a gift from my brother-in-law.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.824
I've never worn it or anything.
Sorry, it's weird.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.620
I have pillows. Do you need anything else?

00:37.538 --> 00:40.290
Yeah, I want you to stop
shitting on this awesome robe.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.293
Well, you can keep it.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.670
I will.

00:44.753 --> 00:49.341
Hey. Are you sure nobody can see
in any of these transoms?

00:49.424 --> 00:50.509
Yeah.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.261
And everything's locked upstairs.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.931
Anybody live in that unit next door?

00:56.014 --> 00:58.892
No, it's just Mrs. Selvig
in the other direction.

00:58.976 --> 01:04.188
The neighborhood never really filled up,
so it's nice. Quiet.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.860
Fortress of solitude.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.738
I still think an occasional mixer
wouldn't hurt anything.

01:11.822 --> 01:15.200
I checked, and it's
not expressly prohibited in the manual.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.285
Yeah, I bet!

01:16.368 --> 01:19.538
Dude, I pressed Cobel
for an all-floor mixer last quarter.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.416
She said you'll get one when you earn it,
whatever that means.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.043
-Cobel?
-I can't imagine Dylan's 4%

01:25.127 --> 01:26.879
on Sunset Park's gonna help with--

01:28.505 --> 01:29.798
Petey?

01:31.216 --> 01:32.384
You okay?

01:35.971 --> 01:37.723
I'm sorry. Yeah.

01:39.725 --> 01:43.896
With this sickness,
I just-- I get disoriented.

01:44.855 --> 01:45.856
It's temporary.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.234
What's Sunset Park?

01:52.404 --> 01:53.447
I don't know.

04:13.128 --> 04:16.464
It's like having two different lives
suddenly stitched together.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.551
But the relativity's fucked.

04:19.635 --> 04:23.639
So, my first day at Lumon's
as far back as my fifth birthday.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.808
And with two pasts,
it blurs the present too.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.937
But they said it will get better.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.149
Who's "they"?

04:37.611 --> 04:40.614
"They" is a group of people that know
severance is a blight on mankind.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.741
And they're gonna do something about it.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.162
The Whole Mind Collective?

04:47.829 --> 04:51.583
The kids trolling for signatures downtown?
No, not the fucking WMC.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.002
Someone else.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.380
All right. Well--

04:59.258 --> 05:02.970
So, what do you want from me?

05:05.722 --> 05:07.766
Don't you wanna know
what you're doing down there?

05:12.479 --> 05:16.149
Okay, look.
You know, I'm not gonna unsever.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.945
Well, I don't want you to unsever
because that's not a word.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.073
-Reintegration.
-All right. Well, whatever.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.118
You know, it hasn't been a blight for me.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.703
It's helped me.

05:29.204 --> 05:32.332
Okay. What if the cost of that help

05:34.042 --> 05:35.919
is that you're murdering people
eight hours a day

05:36.003 --> 05:37.045
and you don't even know it?

05:38.755 --> 05:39.882
Well, am I?

05:42.885 --> 05:47.848
Look, I found a department.
One they don't tell us about.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.600
One where you don't get to leave.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.562
Well, don't none of us get to leave?

05:53.645 --> 05:58.233
No, I mean you really don't get to leave.
As in, they're down there right now.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.444
Well, what? Like, chained up, or--

06:03.530 --> 06:04.823
What?

06:09.953 --> 06:11.705
I'm not gonna talk about it in here.

06:12.873 --> 06:17.211
I don't know if the monitors are bugged.
Or if Irving's gonna walk in.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.888
Petey, we're not at Lumon.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.395
Then where the fuck is June?

06:47.157 --> 06:48.492
I'm sorry, Mark.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.211
Who's June?

07:02.548 --> 07:07.469
June is my daughter. Greatest kid on Earth
and a hell of a guitar player.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.019
How happy are you
that you asked me to stay here?

07:46.550 --> 07:48.135
Oh, Mark.

07:50.888 --> 07:52.598
Are you all right?

07:54.850 --> 07:58.937
But what do you say, Natalie,
to the woman who became pregnant at work

07:59.021 --> 08:01.356
less than a month
after her company went severed?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.859
Well, first,
I'd suggest she reveal her identity

08:03.942 --> 08:05.569
if she wants an honest conversation

08:05.652 --> 08:07.696
-about her experience.
-How could she have that conversation

08:07.779 --> 08:10.699
-when her workie was the one involved--
-Okay, first of all, workie?

08:11.325 --> 08:13.410
That, as I understand,
is the preferred term among--

08:13.493 --> 08:16.246
I think it's exactly the condescending
verbiage that I'd expect

08:16.330 --> 08:18.874
from a group trying to save people
from their own choices.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.667
Choices? Did her insie have a--

08:20.751 --> 08:22.711
Insie? Where are you getting these terms?

08:22.794 --> 08:25.797
Fine. Call it someone
who's had their brain split in half--

08:25.881 --> 08:28.050
That has nothing to do
with what we do at Lumon

08:28.133 --> 08:29.635
nor any severance procedure.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.386
I understand you don't wanna answer
my questions…

08:31.470 --> 08:33.722
-I'm answering your questions.
-…because it'll reveal that you are

08:33.804 --> 08:36.683
-complicit in something totally immoral.
-What's immoral is--

08:41.395 --> 08:42.438
Tell me it's not true.

08:44.525 --> 08:47.027
Well, I want to, but I can't. See?

08:48.153 --> 08:50.030
…continuing through the greater basin,

08:50.113 --> 08:54.535
probably into the afternoon,
just as we predicted yesterday.

08:54.618 --> 08:58.997
The good news is, those clouds should
dissipate somewhere over the Ganz area,

08:59.081 --> 09:03.001
leaving a clear, sunny day,
for our friends in and around Kier.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.796
That said,
the cold's not letting up anywhere.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.674
And those roads are going to remain
icy throughout the week

09:08.757 --> 09:10.175
and on into the weekend.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.761
So wherever you're headed,
please do commute with care.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.228
Petey.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.442
Wake up, Petey. Petey?

09:33.615 --> 09:34.616
Hey.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.703
It's morning. You are in my basement.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.248
Right.

09:41.915 --> 09:46.128
So I'm going to work like you said.
You can stay here if you want.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.590
I just wanna let you know,

09:50.966 --> 09:54.052
I'm not gonna reintegrate, you know?

09:57.347 --> 09:58.348
Okay.

09:59.057 --> 10:02.060
I lost my wife a couple years ago
in a car accident.

10:02.769 --> 10:06.023
This is-- It's helping me, you know?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.483
-I'm sorry, Mark.
-No, no, no. No.

10:10.777 --> 10:11.862
At work…

10:14.781 --> 10:18.994
you'd come in sometimes with red eyes.

10:20.495 --> 10:23.874
We had a joke
that you had an elevator allergy.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.085
There was even a song for it.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.797
But I always wondered.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.635
You carry the hurt with you.

10:35.427 --> 10:38.847
You feel it down there too.
You just don't know what it is.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.268
Okay.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.231
Why don't you grab
whatever you want up in the fridge?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.607
I should be back around 6:00.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.541
Hi!

11:06.291 --> 11:09.878
-Hey.
-Mark, I'm sorry for the racket!

11:10.379 --> 11:13.257
I'm just deicing my stoop.

11:13.340 --> 11:17.177
No worries. Thanks again for the cookies.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.762
I'll bring by more!

11:20.097 --> 11:21.139
Please.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.301
-Mr. Scout, how are you doing?
-Hey, Judd.

12:38.008 --> 12:41.595
I did a thing.
I deleted the scary numbers.

12:41.678 --> 12:42.679
When?

12:42.763 --> 12:45.766
-Yesterday. You were gone.
-I was?

12:45.849 --> 12:49.645
Oh, yeah. Dylan took over training
in your stead to great success.

12:49.728 --> 12:53.106
You look trim, Mark.
I wonder if you were food poisoned.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.317
Welcome back, boss. New photos come in?

12:55.400 --> 12:58.195
Oh, good. You can finally get rid
of those old ones.

13:02.574 --> 13:05.953
You may as well skip it actually,
'cause I put in my resignation request.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.580
-You did submit it?
-I did.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.793
It's good. It means you won't get sent
to the break room anymore.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.921
Hello, Refiners.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.047
Hello, Mr. Milchick.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.841
Mark, I spoke to your outie yesterday.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.968
He sounded just shattered
not to be at work.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.469
But now that you're here,

13:22.553 --> 13:25.597
care to read your first morning
announcements as department head?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.141
Sure.

13:28.976 --> 13:32.104
Should be easier
without me in the audience.

13:34.106 --> 13:37.317
Mark used to find it funny
to interrupt Petey's announcements.

13:37.401 --> 13:38.986
With gas having.

13:40.988 --> 13:45.868
Okay, quiet down, all.
I'm Mark, your new announcements person.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.665
Just a couple things here.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.501
Why are you standing weird? Stand normal.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.421
I'm-- I'm standing great.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.507
Are you uncomfortable?
We could all look away?

14:00.591 --> 14:03.844
Okay, there's been some garbage
in the recycling.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.597
Please, everybody, don't do that.

14:08.056 --> 14:12.811
As a reminder,
Post-it Notes are not to be put on faces.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.521
They clog your outie's pores.

14:15.230 --> 14:18.817
That one's about me.
I do this beloved character, Sticky Head.

14:18.901 --> 14:22.905
Also, please refrain from boasting
about previously earned waffle parties?

14:22.988 --> 14:23.989
Feeling attacked.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.366
And lastly--

14:31.079 --> 14:34.249
Well, I've never seen a resignation
request get such a quick turnaround.

14:36.418 --> 14:39.129
Do I have to finish out the day
or can I skip out now?

14:44.885 --> 14:47.804
Lastly, Helly's resignation request…

14:49.723 --> 14:50.724
was denied.

14:53.519 --> 14:54.770
Yeah, no, that can't be right.

14:55.854 --> 14:56.980
My outie wouldn't do that.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.737
You know, Petey used to say--

15:22.923 --> 15:24.049
This is so fun.

15:25.342 --> 15:30.055
Shall I, you know,
tiptoe up and sneak to the door?

15:30.138 --> 15:32.307
-He's at work, baby. It doesn't matter.
-How do you know?

15:32.391 --> 15:34.393
-Because his car's not here.
-Maybe he played hooky.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.395
Can you go do it? 'Cause I gotta pee.

15:36.895 --> 15:37.980
Yes.

15:51.326 --> 15:54.204
Against the door, or to the side?

15:54.288 --> 15:55.956
I think either's really good.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.043
-Do you think he'll be surprised?
-I do.

16:00.711 --> 16:03.297
My babe, I'm gonna put it off to the side.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.381
Awesome.

16:14.183 --> 16:15.184
-Perfect.
-Good.

16:15.267 --> 16:17.060
-I mean, it's perfect.
-Yes.

16:24.318 --> 16:25.652
He's gonna be so excited.

16:25.736 --> 16:27.196
-Yeah.
-I hope he comes home early.

16:27.279 --> 16:28.405
He's not going to.

17:28.799 --> 17:30.759
Hey. What's that? Sudoku?

17:31.385 --> 17:32.386
It's nothing.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.179
What were you drawing?

17:34.263 --> 17:36.890
You getting back to work, in cubist form.

17:36.974 --> 17:40.143
Kay, two things.
How do you know what cubist form is?

17:40.227 --> 17:42.437
And what the fuck are you wearing?

17:45.607 --> 17:46.733
Oh, fuck.

18:55.886 --> 18:56.887
No.

19:22.621 --> 19:23.622
Yes?

19:29.503 --> 19:32.256
What did he tell her
after the announcement?

19:44.184 --> 19:45.644
No, it's not so bad.

19:52.693 --> 19:55.529
Just mildly aggressive.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.033
Did you give her directed praise?

20:02.077 --> 20:04.496
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

20:05.497 --> 20:06.498
I'm coming.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.188
Hey, Helly?

21:11.271 --> 21:12.272
Go away.

21:12.773 --> 21:14.733
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.485
I mean, it's been, like, 45 minutes.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.116
I'm using the bathroom.

21:23.784 --> 21:27.538
Okay. It's just-- It has been a while.

21:27.621 --> 21:30.249
-I'm fine, Mark.
-I think I need to come in.

21:30.916 --> 21:32.543
-That's-- Okay?
-No!

21:33.126 --> 21:36.171
I am going to come in, so get ready.

21:36.255 --> 21:38.298
Do the things you need to do
'cause I'm comin' in.

21:38.382 --> 21:39.383
No!

21:39.466 --> 21:41.552
-Okay, here I come. I'm sorry.
-Mark, no! I'm not decent!

21:41.635 --> 21:42.845
-Do-- Jesus.
-I'm sorry. I'm--

21:46.390 --> 21:47.975
Writing the note directly on your skin.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.812
Well, unfortunately, the detectors
can pick up lettering anywhere.

21:51.895 --> 21:53.897
Does this look like lettering to you?

21:53.981 --> 21:55.941
Well, if you put your arms together.

21:58.861 --> 21:59.862
Not bad.

22:01.905 --> 22:04.867
I thought you were starting to,
like, be okay here.

22:04.950 --> 22:06.451
What, 'cause I did the numbers thing?

22:06.535 --> 22:09.705
Well, you got a win. You know,
a lot of people find joy in that.

22:09.788 --> 22:11.665
It literally causes fear.

22:11.748 --> 22:14.376
That's just one subset of numbers.
The others are more comforting--

22:14.459 --> 22:16.170
Mark, I don't wanna work here with you.

22:16.253 --> 22:19.006
So don't burst into the bathroom
with your pathetic boss voice on

22:19.089 --> 22:20.382
and try to convince me that I do.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.763
Okay, I'll give you five minutes
to scrub your arms.

22:26.847 --> 22:28.098
Or what?

22:29.391 --> 22:31.602
Do you want Graner to use the bad soap?

22:33.478 --> 22:34.646
There's bad soap?

22:39.776 --> 22:40.986
Thanks, boss.

22:42.029 --> 22:43.697
Yeah, I fucking love working here.

22:44.198 --> 22:45.324
-Mark.
-Irv.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.576
I was listening at the door.
I heard it all.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.661
-Okay.
-I am troubled by you having

22:49.745 --> 22:53.290
high-stress exchanges like that
so fresh off your food poisoning.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.583
It's fine.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.919
The loathing with which she spoke to you.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.462
Well, acclimating takes time.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.796
And guidance.

23:01.507 --> 23:02.674
What's on your mind, Irving?

23:05.761 --> 23:08.805
Dylan was going on all yesterday
about incentives,

23:08.889 --> 23:12.518
pencil erasers and waffle parties,
as though that's why we're here.

23:12.601 --> 23:14.228
That's not why we're here.

23:15.395 --> 23:21.318
If it's a deeper meaning she craves,
she should see the perpetuity wing.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.570
She can read about all that stuff
in the handbook.

23:23.654 --> 23:27.199
You know it's different to be there.
To see it.

23:29.284 --> 23:31.703
It just seems premature.
I mean, that place is a lot.

23:31.787 --> 23:36.208
Correct. That place is everything.

23:41.004 --> 23:42.005
How'd the check go?

23:42.548 --> 23:46.176
There was a package left at his door
from someone. Open it, would you?

23:49.513 --> 23:51.890
-Oh, God.
-Is this the brother-in-law?

23:51.974 --> 23:53.684
Ricken. His fifth book.

23:57.187 --> 24:01.066
"Chapter 12: On Learning to Be
Emotionally Nude in Front of My Wife."

24:01.149 --> 24:04.069
Check it for messages, just to be safe.

24:04.653 --> 24:05.779
Mark.

24:07.197 --> 24:09.157
-Can I help you?
-Does she have a moment?

24:09.241 --> 24:13.036
Did you fill out an official request
for supervisory interaction?

24:14.538 --> 24:16.748
-No, I--
-It's fine. Come in.

24:16.832 --> 24:18.709
Sorry. I can fill out the form.

24:19.418 --> 24:20.419
What is it?

24:23.088 --> 24:24.089
Get the door.

24:28.093 --> 24:31.597
Irving thought we should take Helly
to the perpetuity wing today.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.516
Well, it's a good thing
I made Irving department chief.

24:34.600 --> 24:40.898
Sorry. I think I should take Helly
and the team to the perpetuity wing.

24:40.981 --> 24:44.443
And have you filled out
a common-space reservation slip?

24:46.236 --> 24:48.822
-No, I--
-Mark.

24:48.906 --> 24:52.284
I'm sorry. I've just been-- I don't know.

24:52.367 --> 24:55.037
It's been weird since Petey left.

24:56.663 --> 25:00.751
I mean, you know, he was--
He set the tone.

25:02.836 --> 25:06.924
If Petey were
the tone-setter you're lionizing him as,

25:07.799 --> 25:09.426
he'd still be here.

25:12.054 --> 25:13.055
What does that mean?

25:14.848 --> 25:17.518
Are you gonna make me throw my mug at you?

25:19.061 --> 25:20.812
I-- Why would you--

25:22.898 --> 25:25.442
-Get MDR to its numbers.
-Okay.

25:28.612 --> 25:29.613
Mark?

25:31.240 --> 25:35.869
What I just did was something I knew
that you could handle and grow from.

25:37.037 --> 25:39.373
It was very painful for me.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.460
I hope that you'll let it help you.

25:50.968 --> 25:52.261
Open or closed?

25:58.183 --> 25:59.351
Both.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.606
I'll just--

26:09.903 --> 26:14.950
My delts are embarrassingly good today.
My outie does muscle shows for sure.

26:15.033 --> 26:17.911
If your outie did muscle shows,
you wouldn't have to work here.

26:17.995 --> 26:19.872
I'm sorry, do you know
how much muscle shows pay?

26:19.955 --> 26:21.456
No, none of us can know that.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.333
I imagine it's a tiered system.

26:23.417 --> 26:27.254
Perhaps there are monetary
prizes for gold, silver and bronze.

26:27.337 --> 26:31.508
No. My guess is that
they do it piecemeal per muscle. So…

26:31.592 --> 26:33.969
-No, I don't think so.
-Best delt, 30 bucks.

26:34.052 --> 26:38.140
Best ab, 20 bucks.
Biceps are a little flashier, 75 bucks.

26:38.223 --> 26:39.892
I would think lats carry a high value.

26:39.975 --> 26:42.728
They're considered very attractive
in muscle-building circles.

26:42.811 --> 26:44.605
And in society at large.

26:44.688 --> 26:46.190
Lats are bullshit, dude--

26:46.273 --> 26:49.359
-The center of a good physique.
-You are alone on this one, Irv…

26:49.443 --> 26:51.445
-You've never noticed my lats?
-…I assure you. Never once.

26:51.528 --> 26:56.658
You don't understand why my posture's
ramrod straight. You see how…

27:04.833 --> 27:05.959
Thirsty?

27:09.213 --> 27:12.466
Hey, just in case
you find this relevant for some reason,

27:12.549 --> 27:17.346
the code detectors can read messages
hidden inside the body as well.

27:20.182 --> 27:25.979
Also, when that happens, it's Milchick's
job to extract the message from you.

27:26.563 --> 27:31.235
And when he asks
how long ago you ingested it,

27:31.318 --> 27:34.613
I really can't recommend honesty enough.

27:36.782 --> 27:40.077
It's easier for you both
if he knows which end to start from.

27:50.254 --> 27:51.547
Another good try though.

27:56.552 --> 27:58.846
Go shut down your workstation.
We're taking a trip.

27:58.929 --> 28:00.472
The power is in your calves.

28:00.556 --> 28:04.393
…and it's always been that way.
I can tell you that right now, young boy.

28:05.269 --> 28:07.729
All eight CEOs have been
of the Eagan lineage.

28:07.813 --> 28:09.690
A line dating back to the founder.

28:09.773 --> 28:12.860
I have a mnemonic poem
to help you remember their names.

28:12.943 --> 28:16.363
I authored it myself, and of course,
it falls outside corporate canon,

28:16.446 --> 28:18.740
and it's poetically imperfect, to be sure.

28:18.824 --> 28:22.828
There's a slant rhyme in the second verse.
of "Ambrose" to "ban those,"

28:22.911 --> 28:26.665
which was necessary
to further the narrative, but regrettable.

28:26.748 --> 28:30.502
Ambrose is sometimes unfairly maligned as
a black sheep in the annals of the family.

28:30.586 --> 28:31.587
What's this?

28:31.670 --> 28:34.590
And it certainly wasn't my intent
to slight him further,

28:34.673 --> 28:36.758
-but I think you'll find…
-"Eagan bingo"?

28:37.259 --> 28:38.677
Hey. Eagan bingo.

28:38.760 --> 28:42.264
-We shouldn't, right? This--
-…for when we arrive…

28:42.347 --> 28:44.183
Hey, what the hell is Eagan bingo?

28:44.266 --> 28:46.810
It's how you don't die of boredom
in the perpetuity wing.

28:46.894 --> 28:48.896
And come on,
it'll be an excellent opportunity

28:48.979 --> 28:50.689
for everyone except Irv to bond.

29:02.284 --> 29:03.535
Optics and Design.

29:04.953 --> 29:06.705
Macrodata Refinement.

29:08.624 --> 29:09.625
Burt.

29:09.708 --> 29:10.709
Hi.

29:11.418 --> 29:13.212
I trust that your session was good.

29:13.295 --> 29:15.005
Great, very restorative.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.548
Wa-- You two know each other?

29:16.632 --> 29:21.595
We were just admiring
some Lumon artwork together, very briefly.

29:21.678 --> 29:24.431
Remember, we'll have
those new handbook totes soon.

29:24.515 --> 29:25.641
So exciting.

29:25.724 --> 29:27.935
Thanks for the tip. You got business,
or you out for a stroll?

29:28.018 --> 29:30.854
-Dylan.
-What? I think you guys are cool,

29:30.938 --> 29:34.358
and I'm just wondering what you're up to.
It's rare seeing you out of your hole.

29:34.441 --> 29:37.236
Egg drop challenge
in the team-building space.

29:38.153 --> 29:40.447
Tight department like us
gotta keep our synergy up.

29:40.531 --> 29:43.033
Egg drop challenge.
You buy this fucking shit?

29:43.116 --> 29:44.785
-And what are you guys doing?
-Felicia.

29:44.868 --> 29:48.038
Perpetuity wing visit.
This is Helly, our new refiner.

29:48.121 --> 29:49.456
-This is--
-Welcome, Helly.

29:50.499 --> 29:55.671
Well, we should get back.
Can't leave the nest empty.

29:56.713 --> 29:58.006
Good to see you, O&D.

30:00.175 --> 30:01.510
Those eggs look like shit.

30:07.599 --> 30:08.642
Irving, come on.

30:16.650 --> 30:17.651
Seth?

30:23.615 --> 30:24.783
Natalie.

30:24.867 --> 30:26.869
Harmony, hello.

30:27.494 --> 30:30.706
I wasn't expecting-- Is this about Helena?

30:31.290 --> 30:33.417
No, this is about Peter Kilmer.

30:33.500 --> 30:36.044
And I should tell you
that the Board is joining us.

31:03.614 --> 31:05.532
The Board would like you to speak first.

31:05.616 --> 31:07.117
Oh, yes. Of course.

31:07.701 --> 31:09.036
Salutations.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.669
So the search for Kilmer continues.

31:24.426 --> 31:26.178
I will say this.

31:26.261 --> 31:29.431
Not to be alarmist,
but prior to his departure,

31:29.515 --> 31:34.394
there were some troubling signs
of possible… reintegration.

31:47.908 --> 31:48.909
Okay.

31:48.992 --> 31:52.037
So, the Board is conveying pretty strongly

31:52.120 --> 31:55.374
that the severance procedure is
provenly irreversible.

31:56.291 --> 31:57.292
Yes--

31:57.376 --> 32:01.255
And that this knowledge should be a given
for a person managing a severed floor.

32:01.338 --> 32:02.506
Yes, of course.

32:02.589 --> 32:05.592
While, of course, getting MDR
to their projected numbers

32:05.676 --> 32:07.845
by the quarterly deadline in three weeks.

32:07.928 --> 32:09.596
Yes, of course.

32:10.514 --> 32:15.269
We are quickly rekindling our yield
down here with our nimble new refiner.

32:15.853 --> 32:18.772
-And for what it's worth, I'd like--
-The Board has concluded the call.

32:21.483 --> 32:24.069
Yes, okay. Thank you.

32:26.071 --> 32:28.282
-And may I ask--
-Goodbye, Harmony.

32:34.454 --> 32:37.833
There's seriously a two-person department?
Like, they only ever see each other?

32:37.916 --> 32:41.128
For the most part. It's lonely, I suspect.

32:41.211 --> 32:43.213
And unnatural. Perverse.

32:43.297 --> 32:44.381
O&D is nice.

32:44.464 --> 32:47.217
No, they're not.
Nor do they share our values.

32:47.301 --> 32:49.261
Kier sorted the departments by virtue.

32:49.344 --> 32:53.056
Macrodats are clever and true,
while O&D's more cruelty-centered.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.266
How many departments are there?

32:54.349 --> 32:55.475
-Probably 30.
-Around five.

32:55.559 --> 32:56.935
No one's quite sure.

32:57.019 --> 32:59.897
O&D tried a violent coup on the others
decades ago,

32:59.980 --> 33:01.773
and that's why
they reduced them down to two.

33:01.857 --> 33:03.734
And that's why they keep us all
so far apart now.

33:03.817 --> 33:05.527
That's an absolute fiction.

33:05.611 --> 33:06.737
Did they ever kill anyone?

33:06.820 --> 33:09.448
Nope. There was no coup.
No one killed anyone.

33:09.531 --> 33:11.617
Then why don't we ever hang out?

33:12.534 --> 33:14.870
I mean, I'm 99% sure there was no coup.

33:17.247 --> 33:20.042
If they come back and attack us,
I think we should kill Mark.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.251
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

33:21.752 --> 33:23.712
So they think we're crazy
with nothing to lose.

33:23.795 --> 33:25.005
Smart. That's smart.

33:25.088 --> 33:28.091
Like, I'm imagining them rounding
a corner, and we're all blood-soaked,

33:28.175 --> 33:31.720
and I'm wearing your face,
and they're like, "Whose face is that?"

33:31.803 --> 33:35.057
And I'm like,
"The last person who fucked with us."

33:36.391 --> 33:38.769
And that's just feeling like
a really powerful image to me.

33:38.852 --> 33:42.272
Just-- Seems like
they'd recognize my face.

33:42.356 --> 33:43.857
Maybe if you wore it inside out?

33:53.867 --> 33:54.868
We're here.

34:10.676 --> 34:13.303
"Come now, children of my industry,

34:13.846 --> 34:16.764
and know the children of my blood."

34:19.601 --> 34:20.601
Whoa.

34:21.478 --> 34:27.734
That's Jame Eagan.
Current CEO. Remarkable man.

34:28.569 --> 34:31.530
Handsome too. See those brows?

34:54.719 --> 34:58.307
All the center displays are for
a past Eagan CEO.

34:59.057 --> 35:01.935
But the whole back part is Kier.

35:25.209 --> 35:28.295
I know that death is near upon me,

35:28.378 --> 35:34.593
because people have begun to ask
what I see as my life's great achievement.

35:35.177 --> 35:40.516
They wish to know
how they should remember me as I rot.

35:41.266 --> 35:48.106
In my life, I have identified
four components, which I call tempers,

35:48.190 --> 35:52.236
from which are derived every human soul.

35:52.819 --> 35:58.242
Woe. Frolic. Dread. Malice.

35:59.076 --> 36:04.790
Each man's character is defined
by the precise ratio

36:04.873 --> 36:06.583
that resides in him.

36:07.376 --> 36:12.881
I walked into the cave
of my own mind, and there I tamed them.

36:12.965 --> 36:17.469
Should you tame the tempers as I did mine,

36:17.553 --> 36:21.306
then the world shall become
but your appendage.

36:21.390 --> 36:25.102
It is this great and consecrated power

36:25.185 --> 36:30.482
that I hope to pass on
to all of you, my children.

36:32.693 --> 36:34.862
I think that to be an Eagan,

36:34.945 --> 36:39.783
either a true Eagan
or anyone working in this Lumon family,

36:39.867 --> 36:42.744
what you are is the keeper of an ethos,

36:42.828 --> 36:47.583
a compact of values
that we have long held as precious,

36:47.666 --> 36:51.795
and which I do believe
will one day save this world.

36:51.879 --> 36:54.298
And that ethos goes all the way back

36:54.381 --> 36:56.091
-through my blood…
-Look, you got one.

36:56.175 --> 36:58.468
…to where we all started, with Kier.

36:58.552 --> 37:00.846
-It's okay if you cry.
-When I was a girl,

37:01.513 --> 37:03.140
my father would make me whisper…

37:03.223 --> 37:05.726
She was five CEOs ago.

37:07.102 --> 37:08.729
They'd never had a woman before.

37:09.479 --> 37:14.359
And she told her father at age seven,
she was going to be the first.

37:14.443 --> 37:16.069
Vision. Verve.

37:16.153 --> 37:17.696
-Isn't that lovely?
-Wit.

37:17.779 --> 37:19.031
-It's beautiful.
-Cheer.

37:19.656 --> 37:22.910
It almost makes me wish
I remembered my own childhood.

37:22.993 --> 37:27.789
Nimbleness. Probity. Wiles.

37:28.624 --> 37:33.962
It's an unnatural state
for a person to have no history.

37:34.463 --> 37:40.010
History makes us someone.
Gives us a context. A shape.

37:40.677 --> 37:44.932
But waking up on that table,
I was shapeless.

37:47.017 --> 37:52.189
But then I learned
that I work for a company

37:52.272 --> 37:58.278
that has been actively caring
for mankind since 1866.

37:59.029 --> 38:00.113
Look.

38:00.197 --> 38:05.536
Each of these is a real smile
from someone on the outside.

38:06.245 --> 38:09.414
Someone Lumon Industries has helped.

38:10.082 --> 38:12.417
And they rotate these through.

38:12.501 --> 38:16.797
The true number of smiles may well be
in the millions.

38:18.549 --> 38:20.342
So what are we, like, a dental company?

38:20.425 --> 38:21.552
No.

38:21.635 --> 38:24.638
My point is you're part of a history now.

38:24.721 --> 38:27.266
-A noble one.
-And that's so much more mea--

38:27.349 --> 38:28.433
They update the mouth wall?

38:28.934 --> 38:31.645
It's not called the "mouth wall."

38:31.728 --> 38:33.647
Damn, they took down the chick I like.

38:34.189 --> 38:36.275
-Are you guys ready to go?
-We just got here.

38:38.193 --> 38:40.654
She hasn't even seen the Kier part yet.

38:44.867 --> 38:45.868
Gerhardt.

39:00.090 --> 39:02.718
-Jesus.
-No. Kier.

39:03.927 --> 39:04.970
It's his house?

39:05.053 --> 39:07.055
A perfect replica.

39:07.139 --> 39:08.140
Pretty cool, huh?

39:09.266 --> 39:11.268
Yeah, pretty cool.

39:40.130 --> 39:45.219
The bedroom of Kier,
just as he might have left it.

39:49.598 --> 39:50.974
Well, this is thorough.

39:51.975 --> 39:55.687
I hate this place.
It smells like 19th century ass.

39:55.771 --> 39:59.274
Stop treating this
like some kind of beer party.

39:59.358 --> 40:01.568
That's not fair.
Up till now, I've been reverent as shit.

40:03.487 --> 40:04.488
-Mark.
-Yeah?

40:06.949 --> 40:10.744
Were you about to… bed sit?

40:10.827 --> 40:13.497
No. Nuh-uh.

40:15.874 --> 40:18.752
What's that in your pocket, Mark?

40:20.712 --> 40:21.713
I--

40:22.589 --> 40:26.218
Oh, God, Mark. Still?

40:27.845 --> 40:29.680
It's… for fun.

40:29.763 --> 40:31.265
It's the perpetuity wing.

40:31.974 --> 40:33.684
It's the Eagans.

40:33.767 --> 40:38.105
It's the living soul of Lumon
and everything she stands for,

40:38.188 --> 40:39.565
not a bingo match.

40:39.648 --> 40:43.277
Look, Kier said,
"Keep a merry humor ever in your heart."

40:44.194 --> 40:45.863
Did you give one to the trainee?

40:47.447 --> 40:48.448
Of course, you did.

40:49.867 --> 40:52.035
She's starved for meaning here.

40:52.119 --> 40:54.705
So, of course, you'd pervert
our founder's message

40:54.788 --> 40:57.207
with jokes and impiety.

40:57.291 --> 41:01.253
That's definitely what she needs
from her department chief.

41:01.336 --> 41:03.172
Hey, I didn't want to be department chief.

41:03.255 --> 41:05.924
I didn't ask for Petey to disappear
and for--

41:10.888 --> 41:11.889
Helly?

41:13.724 --> 41:14.725
Uh-oh.

41:15.517 --> 41:16.518
Helly?

41:17.269 --> 41:18.854
Shit.

41:47.090 --> 41:48.091
Helly!

41:52.596 --> 41:54.765
This is… Jesus.

42:15.869 --> 42:16.870
Helly!

42:30.175 --> 42:31.385
Helly!

42:36.640 --> 42:37.641
Helly!

42:40.435 --> 42:41.770
No!

42:43.939 --> 42:45.816
Goddamn it, Helly.

42:57.911 --> 42:59.663
This way, please, Helly R.

43:39.703 --> 43:40.704
On you go.

44:14.947 --> 44:16.949
I'm truly sorry to see you here, Helly.

44:27.835 --> 44:29.503
I hoped you'd just settle in.

44:32.089 --> 44:35.342
I know Mark's been trying so hard
to get you to feel happy.

44:43.934 --> 44:48.772
Look, you seem like a smart person.
But don't you see how fucked up this is?

44:49.273 --> 44:50.691
-You can't keep--
-Not right now, Helly.

44:53.110 --> 44:55.237
Sit. Please.

45:11.545 --> 45:13.088
Hands on the table, please.

45:52.461 --> 45:54.963
I'm bringing up the compunction statement
for Helly R.

46:01.553 --> 46:02.554
What is this?

46:06.225 --> 46:07.226
Read it.

46:10.687 --> 46:11.688
I don't want to.

46:13.273 --> 46:15.275
No. Do.

46:21.823 --> 46:25.369
"Forgive me for the harm
I have caused this world.

46:26.411 --> 46:29.831
None may atone for my actions but me,

46:29.915 --> 46:32.626
and only in me shall their stain live on.

46:33.836 --> 46:36.505
I am thankful to have been caught,

46:36.588 --> 46:38.966
my fall cut short
by those with wizened hands.

46:39.633 --> 46:41.760
All I can be is sorry,
and that is all I am."

46:45.889 --> 46:47.391
I'm afraid you don't mean it.

46:49.351 --> 46:50.352
Excuse me?

46:52.062 --> 46:53.230
Again, please.

46:56.024 --> 46:58.694
"Forgive me for the harm
I have caused this world.

47:00.112 --> 47:02.990
None may atone for my actions but me,

47:04.032 --> 47:07.327
and only in me shall their stain live on.

47:07.911 --> 47:09.955
I am thankful to have been caught,

47:10.539 --> 47:13.208
my fall cut short
by those with wizened hands.

47:14.042 --> 47:16.879
All I can be is sorry,
and that is all I am."

47:23.260 --> 47:24.428
Again.

47:27.181 --> 47:28.182
Really?

47:33.687 --> 47:34.688
Fun day.

47:36.648 --> 47:37.649
See you tomorrow.

47:39.651 --> 47:40.652
Yeah.

47:42.362 --> 47:43.614
Do you want me to get these?

47:44.907 --> 47:45.908
Yeah, go ahead.

50:02.169 --> 50:05.964
I haven't any tokens.
I can't eat with no tokens.

50:13.639 --> 50:14.640
Hey!

50:15.724 --> 50:17.434
I need tokens so I can eat!

50:27.152 --> 50:28.028
Oh, my God.

51:34.386 --> 51:35.387
Petey?

51:41.602 --> 51:42.603
Petey?

53:05.936 --> 53:07.354
All right now. Take it slow.

53:11.692 --> 53:13.652
Did you happen to see
which direction he came from?

53:15.737 --> 53:17.781
I'm just gonna grab the stretcher.
I'll be right back.

53:18.323 --> 53:19.616
Can you get an ID on this guy?

53:23.245 --> 53:26.540
I guess he's from nearby.
He came in with a robe on. That was it.

53:38.594 --> 53:39.803
He's down. He's down.

53:39.887 --> 53:42.014
Sir. Sir, sir, sir. Can you hear me?

53:42.097 --> 53:43.682
You got that? Just stand back.

53:43.765 --> 53:48.562
Yeah, dispatch, I got a 10-53
at a convenience store on 42nd.

53:48.645 --> 53:49.897
Call that in, please.

53:51.523 --> 53:53.692
-Is he breathing?
-No, he's not breathing, man.

53:53.775 --> 53:55.110
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me the bpm.

53:56.820 --> 53:59.239
-You okay? You okay?
-Get him on the board.
