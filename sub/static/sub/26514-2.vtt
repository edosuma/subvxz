00:12.012 --> 00:13.388
<i>Previously on </i>Dynasty:

00:13.471 --> 00:18.768
I intend to spend every dime I have
before they put me in the ground.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.479
-Get my money, or I'm going to the cops.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.732
Take it.
That's what you came for, isn't it?

00:24.357 --> 00:28.903
You are obsessed with that family.
You should claim to be Cristal Flores.

00:29.028 --> 00:32.240
-I may have gotten someone pregnant.
-This baby is what I need.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.575
You're unbelievable, Sam.

00:33.658 --> 00:37.328
I'll tell you what's unbelievable.
The fact that a premenopausal woman

00:37.412 --> 00:39.831
got knocked up
by a gay man she slept with once.

00:39.914 --> 00:42.917
I sent you away
because I thought you would be better off

00:43.001 --> 00:45.754
in Australia with your mother.
I still think that's the case.

00:45.837 --> 00:49.799
-Kirby Anders, all grown up.
-Thanks for letting me crash.

00:49.883 --> 00:50.717
Uncle Max.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.677
I'm sure Liam mentioned,
you get on my bad side,

00:52.761 --> 00:54.471
you'll wish you never heard
of the Van Kirks.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.764
I'm lucky to have Liam's help.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.558
He's lucky he has a wife
who's heir to an empire I wanna buy.

00:58.641 --> 01:01.394
Fallon Carrington,
will you finally do me the honor

01:01.478 --> 01:02.353
of being my wife?

01:03.313 --> 01:06.983
Uncle Max is flying us to see my family.
They can't wait to meet my wife.

01:11.571 --> 01:15.700
Okay, so we've covered
your great-uncle Roger.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.952
-Yup.
-Your cousins Carter and Marsha.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.581
Anyone else you need to warn me about
before I meet the Van Kirk clan?

01:22.248 --> 01:23.792
I mean, I have a niece, Emily.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.544
She's like every girl
you went to prep school with.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.088
Can you tell me why
your uncle has so many enemies

01:29.172 --> 01:30.548
that he needs armed guards?

01:30.632 --> 01:33.551
I think it's about the quality of enemies
versus quantity.

01:34.427 --> 01:35.762
That makes me feel better.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.097
Now you know why I live in Atlanta.

01:38.890 --> 01:42.060
But I love my family.
And Max's wife, Maura, is really sweet.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.605
Though I think she might still be away
at the spa.

01:45.688 --> 01:47.232
Oh, I know that code.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.610
Listen, let's just get through this.

01:51.069 --> 01:54.614
Get Max to sign the contract
so your family can own Carrington Atlantic

01:54.697 --> 01:57.659
and I can stop having to memorize
the quirks of your relatives.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.285
I'm on board.

01:59.828 --> 02:03.373
But since my entire family thinks
that we're married,

02:03.456 --> 02:06.668
we might have to actually kind of act
like we like each other.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.630
We can just hold hands.

02:11.589 --> 02:16.845
Whoa. That thing is sharp.
What happened to the ring I gave you?

02:16.928 --> 02:21.141
Culhane replaced it with this one.
He proposed to me last night. I said yes.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.642
-Oh.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.313
-Hi.
<i>Hey, how's it going, babe?</i>

02:27.772 --> 02:29.149
<i>I confirmed with the Plaza.</i>

02:29.232 --> 02:31.734
<i>Liam and I have separate rooms.</i>
<i>We're not even on the same floor.</i>

02:32.277 --> 02:35.947
Fallon, we're engaged. I trust you.
That's not why I'm calling.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.993
Apparently,
your father has some announcement.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.953
After sleeping on it,
I realized we should talk

02:42.036 --> 02:43.955
about what happened
at the anniversary party.

02:44.038 --> 02:47.500
I'm glad you came to your senses.
That "Blake time" thing was embarrassing.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.336
-Apology accepted.
Oh, I am not apologizing.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.464
-Blake time is real.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.675
I spent the morning mapping out

02:55.758 --> 02:58.678
how I'm going to spend all of my money
or die trying.

02:58.761 --> 03:02.140
Which includes changing my will
and cutting you all out of it.

03:02.223 --> 03:03.474
What? I just got in it.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.768
<i></i>
-No, I am not.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.605
After the sale of the company,
you will have plenty of money,

03:08.688 --> 03:12.692
which means you will get no more from me,
including after I am dead.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.861
That's eternal Blake time.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.905
Tell them what happens next.

03:17.405 --> 03:21.451
Mr. Carrington has directed that any money
left over will be buried with him

03:21.534 --> 03:22.619
in the mausoleum.

03:22.702 --> 03:26.122
<i></i>

03:26.205 --> 03:27.665
I have never been saner.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.960
Morning. Hmm.

03:32.670 --> 03:33.838
When did you sneak out?

03:35.715 --> 03:38.801
Oh, yeah. More than once.
Didn't you hear them?

03:38.885 --> 03:42.096
Mother, you realize I can see your nipples
from New York, right?

03:42.180 --> 03:46.142
-I am perfectly comfortable.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.898
-Uh... Me too.
You can do whatever you want.

03:53.274 --> 03:57.028
Anders and I will be spending the day
replacing the cars I lost in the fire.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.949
Did you do anything exciting last night?

04:05.745 --> 04:07.163
Oh, good, you made coffee.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.917
I've been up since 5 trying
to get everything done for tomorrow.

04:11.209 --> 04:15.255
The DJ's booked. You hired extra security.
Are you forgetting something?

04:15.338 --> 04:17.757
If I could think of it,
it wouldn't be forgotten.

04:19.384 --> 04:23.429
Look, you only get to open this club once,
with our name on it.

04:23.513 --> 04:27.392
I get that you built your fortune
on an app that never saw the light of day.

04:27.475 --> 04:31.271
And like you, I wanna build a real name
for us, apart from the Carringtons.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.481
But you've got to trust me. Okay?

04:34.399 --> 04:35.984
-I've got this.
Monica?

04:37.402 --> 04:38.611
It's me.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.822
Kirby. Anders.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.992
It's so good to see you.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.080
I just came out to get some clothes.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.915
You could definitely use some.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.336
Jeff has been telling me
about the club you're opening.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.006
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.466
He also mentioned
you might need extra help.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.844
And I worked at a ton of clubs back home.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.889
It's like karma.
You need help. I need a job.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.474
I think you mean kismet.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.352
The last time I saw you,
you were being exiled from Atlanta

05:11.436 --> 05:12.812
for attempted arson.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.689
If you were me, would you hire you?

05:14.772 --> 05:18.401
First of all, digging your honesty.
But I was never the crazy one.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.361
Let me guess. It was Fallon.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.157
I heard about what happened
between your two families,

05:24.240 --> 05:26.868
-That was Blake. Fallon and I are in a good place,
so don't go there.

05:30.246 --> 05:34.709
But you probably could use an extra set
of hands, for today at least.

05:34.792 --> 05:35.835
Right?

05:35.918 --> 05:39.130
Fine. But no promises about the future.

05:39.213 --> 05:42.050
Whatever you need, I can do it.
I'll just get changed.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.598
You slept with Dirty Kirby?

05:49.265 --> 05:52.351
Come on, that's just some bitchy nickname
Fallon gave her.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.896
And the fact that she almost
burnt down Carrington Manor?

05:55.271 --> 05:58.066
It was a long time ago.
Kids love playing with fire.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.109
-People change.
-Clearly.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.570
Kirby's sleeping with guys now, for one.

06:04.655 --> 06:07.575
<i>I'd do it all over again</i>
<i>if I could save poor Celia.</i>

06:07.950 --> 06:09.202
<i>You mean Cristal Flores?</i>

06:10.453 --> 06:14.248
<i>Well, who is she, really?</i>
<i>A tortured soul with a hard life.</i>

06:15.166 --> 06:16.292
<i>Stolen identity.</i>

06:18.336 --> 06:19.545
It's another one.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.591
<i>Yes...</i>

06:23.674 --> 06:26.385
I'd like to speak to Mr. Blake Carrington
if possible.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.262
My name is Cristal Jennings.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.722
I'm sorry, Ms. Jennings,

06:29.806 --> 06:33.059
but the Cristal Flores gravy train
has left the station.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.520
-Good luck next time.
<i>-No, you don't understand.</i>

06:35.603 --> 06:37.438
If I could just talk
to Mr. Blake Carrington.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.023
The answer is no.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.331
Sam. What are you doing up here?

06:55.957 --> 06:57.875
I can't stop thinking
about what you told me.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.169
I'm worried Melissa Daniels is a liar.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.798
You should be.
She is a lying, thieving predator.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.383
The thing I didn't tell you...

07:06.509 --> 07:09.178
is that she slept with Steven
when he was only 18. Was that before or after
you slept with her husband?

07:12.306 --> 07:14.684
The point is, she's not getting any money
in the divorce,

07:14.767 --> 07:18.396
so when she looks at Steven,
she sees dimples and dollar signs.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.774
I have doubts that she's pregnant
with anything other than carbs.

07:22.191 --> 07:25.570
We can't tell Steven until we have proof.
He'll think I'm petty and vindictive.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.655
I can't imagine why.

07:34.495 --> 07:36.873
You know what they say.
Keep your enemies close.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.042
So, ingratiate yourself with Melissa.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.628
Maybe she'll slip up
and we'll catch her in a lie.

07:42.712 --> 07:46.507
-This is insane. I'm not a detective.
-Well, maybe you can be now.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.469
<i>Law and Order: Fashion Victim.</i>

07:58.227 --> 08:00.813
Thank you. Aww.
Thank you. Yours, too.

08:01.230 --> 08:04.609
I hope you know that half
that wedding

08:04.692 --> 08:06.110
Well, maybe if you're lucky.

08:07.028 --> 08:07.945
Thank you.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.363
Hey.

08:12.116 --> 08:14.660
What are you trying to do,
consummate the marriage?

08:14.744 --> 08:15.912
Fallon.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.498
-Oh, Uncle Max, hi.
-Come here. Come here.

08:18.581 --> 08:19.582
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:20.416 --> 08:23.628
-Wow.
-Max, let the poor girl go.

08:23.711 --> 08:24.879
You're suffocating her.

08:25.922 --> 08:26.839
Liam.  Aunt Maura.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.802
And this must be Fallon Carrington.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.888
Are those extensions?

08:34.514 --> 08:39.644
-Uh... No, all mine. Nice to meet you.
I would like to make a toast.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.105
To the marriage of the Van Kirks
and the Carringtons,

08:43.189 --> 08:47.568
both personally and,
once I sign the paperwork, professionally.

08:48.819 --> 08:49.737
Cheers.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.824
And I'd like to add just a few words
of my own.

08:54.116 --> 08:57.203
As you may know, I've been away
for the last couple of months,

08:57.286 --> 08:59.664
recovering from exhaustion.

08:59.997 --> 09:03.584
So, I just found out about all of this.

09:06.420 --> 09:10.091
I may not have a vote in this acquisition,
but I do have an opinion.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.177
And I think we would be foolish

09:13.261 --> 09:16.931
to get mixed up
with this kind of new money.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.099
New money?

09:18.599 --> 09:20.560
My great-grandfather
started Carrington Atlantic.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.186
We just celebrated our hundredth year.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.647
Doesn't make you old money.
It makes you lucky.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.191
And your father is clearly an imbecile.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.026
Why else would he leave the company

09:29.110 --> 09:32.947
in the hands of some diamond-encrusted
CEO Barbie?

09:33.030 --> 09:35.157
Okay, that's enough, Maura.

09:35.741 --> 09:41.289
Darling, I agree.
Our family should kill this deal today.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.792
Or else I'll go to the press tomorrow
and kill it myself.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.628
But in the meantime,

09:48.546 --> 09:50.214
congrats to the happy couple.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.741
I'd forgotten how fun it is to register.

10:16.824 --> 10:17.658
-Yes.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.661
-It was the best part of getting married.

10:20.745 --> 10:24.165
-Second best.
-Here, Steven, pick something you like.

10:25.666 --> 10:26.667
Yeah...

10:27.835 --> 10:31.088
Oh, yeah. This bouncy bungee-cord thing
could be fun, right?

10:31.964 --> 10:35.301
Yeah. It's possibly an accident
waiting to happen.

10:35.384 --> 10:38.054
Yeah, I'm not even sure
why they're selling that.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.182
Great. Good to know
my fatherly instincts are on the money.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.685
To be fair, I don't think
my dad knew what to do with us

10:44.769 --> 10:47.438
until we were old enough to golf,
and even then.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.273
You're gonna be a great father.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.151
Our baby is already so lucky
just to be a Carrington.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.237
So, how are you feeling these days,
Melissa?

10:55.321 --> 10:56.906
'Cause you look perfectly fine.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.241
It's weird that you haven't been sick,
isn't it?

10:59.325 --> 11:03.829
Well, the first trimester was not pretty,
believe me.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.375
Oh. Have you thought more
about tomorrow night?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.377
The prenatal meditation class?

11:10.878 --> 11:13.881
I thought that was more
of a mother-baby thing.

11:13.964 --> 11:16.300
Are you kidding? That sounds amazing.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.469
-We could host it here.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.472
We never have enough pregnant women
around the Manor,

11:22.139 --> 11:23.432
and it could be fun.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.351
And real bonding time for all of us.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.230
-I love it.
-Just let me think about it.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.567
What are you driving these days, Anders?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.820
Maybe it's time
we got you some new wheels.

11:35.903 --> 11:38.697
Hey. What about this Bel Air, right here?

11:39.156 --> 11:41.325
Very generous, but completely unnecessary.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.494
Oh, no. That is where we disagree.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.414
I wasn't kidding
about spending all my money.

11:46.997 --> 11:50.418
-Everything looks good, Charlie.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.421
Here's the list of cars
that I need to replace.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.258
Tough break with that fire.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.302
Well, that's what I get
for storing my cars in a stable. What can you tell me
about those two gull

12:04.557 --> 12:07.184
I think Mr. Anders here
has his eye on one.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.562
-Exquisite.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.565
-Both.

12:13.858 --> 12:18.362
-I'd like to corner the market.
-Well, there is one more left, actually.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.573
It's in circulation
with a private collector in Florida.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.660
Anders, looks like
we'll be making some calls to Florida.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.540
-She's usually very sweet, I promise.
-Yeah, real bag of sugar.

12:29.623 --> 12:30.916
Everything is fine.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.502
Maura just had a long flight.
She's exhausted.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.588
I have to apologize for my wife.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.174
I don't care what you do
as long as the deal isn't in jeopardy.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.259
Well, not anymore, thanks to me.

12:40.342 --> 12:44.972
Well, then you are officially my favorite
of the Van Kirks. No offense, sweetie.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.849
Did she say why she freaked out?

12:46.932 --> 12:50.060
Apparently, her family had
business dealings with your father

12:50.144 --> 12:51.437
that didn't go over well.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.481
I knew nothing about that.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.317
But once I told her
he didn't approve of the deal,

12:56.400 --> 12:59.111
-she perked right up.
-Well, look at that.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.531
My dad acting like a complete ass
finally pays off for me.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.158
It only took 25 years.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.286
So, now can we sign the contract
and move forward?

13:07.369 --> 13:10.456
What is it with you?
Nothing but business, business, business.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.917
We're in New York. Let's celebrate, okay?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.878
You gotta be getting sick and tired
of that Southern food.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.005
Okay, fine.

13:18.088 --> 13:21.509
But we are stopping at Bergdorf's.
Barbie needs to change her outfit.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.430
["Don't Stop Get It"
playing over speakers]

13:33.020 --> 13:36.732
Sorry, but I thought these guys would work
harder if there was more energy.

13:37.274 --> 13:38.192
Wait, what?

13:38.275 --> 13:40.611
I was just saying I finished everything
you asked me to do.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.364
And I even started
to consolidate the guest list.

13:43.447 --> 13:46.784
Hope you don't mind.
You know, initiative and all that.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.536
That guest list is worthless.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.581
Well, you didn't even look at it,
and... I used a special font.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.543
Migos is playing a surprise show
at Purgatory tomorrow.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.505
-I don't understand.
They're a hip

13:59.588 --> 14:03.717
I'm from Australia, not Antarctica.
But what's Purgatory?

14:03.801 --> 14:07.346
A club three blocks from here.
This is not coincidence. It's sabotage.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.224
-We aren't gonna do anything.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.977
I'm gonna call a booker friend
and see who I can get to play here

14:13.060 --> 14:13.978
on 24 hours' notice.

14:18.816 --> 14:19.650
Hold down the fort.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.444
I'm gonna fix this.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.615
I want my million,
not some picture.

14:26.699 --> 14:30.035
As much as I value your knowledge
of fine art, Hank,

14:30.119 --> 14:31.537
this is not just a picture.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.373
-It's a Rembrandt.

14:34.456 --> 14:37.668
Being an idiot
is not gonna make it happen any faster.

14:37.751 --> 14:39.461
This painting is collateral.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.298
Well, great. Where do I sell it,
some kind of art store?

14:42.381 --> 14:45.634
You don't sell it anywhere, moron.
You couldn't if you wanted to.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.428
Do you not understand
what collateral means?

14:48.679 --> 14:50.764
Maybe... not.

14:51.223 --> 14:54.310
It means that you hold on to this
until I get you the money next month.

14:54.393 --> 14:58.063
Then you give me back the painting,
and I return it to Carrington Manor.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.649
-No.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.194
Between the insurance payment
and Blake, I will get you real money.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.739
But in the meantime, you lay low,

15:06.822 --> 15:10.159
you be quiet about our deal,
or the two of us are gonna end up in jail.

15:14.246 --> 15:18.834
Seems kind of small to be worth anything.
Do you have any bigger ones?

15:24.173 --> 15:27.968
Wow. I didn't realize
my nephew had such good taste.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.637
How many carats is this?

15:30.554 --> 15:32.473
Well, a gentlemen never tells.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.892
Since I'm not one,
I'll tell you it's a little north of nine.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.562
Ah. Excuse me.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.900
-This has been great, Max.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.319
Please let me get the bill.
To thank you for saving the deal.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.696
The bill has already
been taken care of, dear.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.075
But if you really wanna thank me,

15:51.533 --> 15:53.702
come to my penthouse tomorrow for dinner.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.039
Maura's out at the Hamptons
with some girlfriends.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.792
Sorry about that.

16:02.544 --> 16:03.712
Did I miss anything?

16:05.547 --> 16:07.424
Just business as usual.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.181
I should get back to the office,
but you two...

16:14.264 --> 16:15.474
You should take her to the Met.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.643
They got a couple of new Picassos.
They're beautiful.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.228
Maybe we'll check it out.

16:19.311 --> 16:23.524
Did you know Marie-Thérèse Walter was 17
when Picasso started sleeping with her?

16:23.607 --> 16:26.360
He was 45, and married, incidentally.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.238
Well, nobody's perfect, right?

16:30.447 --> 16:34.743
I suppose we could all forgive a genius
for an indiscretion or two.

16:37.746 --> 16:38.956
You two have fun, okay?

16:40.874 --> 16:42.626
Uh... Max?

16:44.878 --> 16:45.921
I think you dropped this.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.675
-Oh.
It's such a beautiful day.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.678
we'll check out the park.
I look forward to hearing from your team,

16:52.761 --> 16:54.013
or maybe you'll hear from mine.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.600
This one keeps you on your toes,
doesn't she?

16:58.976 --> 16:59.893
Oh...

17:03.647 --> 17:06.734
This is stupid. I followed Melissa
through the grocery store,

17:06.817 --> 17:09.570
and then some old lady hit me
with her cart in the freezer aisle.

17:10.487 --> 17:13.490
-It's definitely gonna bruise.
-I need you to focus, dear.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.034
<i>What did you find out?</i>

17:15.534 --> 17:18.120
I don't know what smoking gun
you think we're going to find,

17:18.203 --> 17:20.205
but I'm guessing it's not smoked turkey.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.541
Or brie. Now I'm just hungry.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.209
She's buying deli meat?

17:24.293 --> 17:27.046
<i>A pregnant woman</i>
<i>isn't supposed to eat cold cuts, Sam.</i>

17:27.212 --> 17:29.548
-Oh.
-Or unpasteurized cheeses.

17:29.631 --> 17:33.010
And where there's smoked turkey,
there's fire.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.182
-We could do the Empire Club.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.851
Only to impress the girls.

17:40.934 --> 17:44.188
Maybe 8? We can toast to your success.

17:44.521 --> 17:48.150
I should make it an early night.
We can celebrate when the deal's closed.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.111
-Of course. Don't wanna jinx anything.
-Right.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.031
Do you know Northstone Of course.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.743
My uncle is having dinner
with them tonight.

17:57.826 --> 17:58.827
What?

17:59.453 --> 18:02.331
Why would he need another meeting
with an energy company

18:02.414 --> 18:04.124
when he's about to own
Carrington Atlantic?

18:04.208 --> 18:05.250
I don't know.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.420
Maybe Maura was getting in his ear again?

18:09.379 --> 18:11.590
Everything seemed great
when we left lunch.

18:20.641 --> 18:21.934
Sorry to disturb you.

18:22.017 --> 18:23.852
You're just the man I wanted to see.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.896
I think we should build a track
for those cars.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.439
Custom, just for us to race. Oh, I'll get right onto it.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.486
I've been tracking the third gull-wing.

18:32.569 --> 18:35.823
The buyer, as it turns out, is in Atlanta.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.992
-And it may be a coincidence.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.244
The buyer is Jeff Colby.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.039
What does he want with that car?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.792
I think it's less about the cars
and more about you.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.676
Hi, I'm here to see Mr. Van Kirk.

18:55.759 --> 18:59.012
-And, no, he's not expecting me.
-Fallon.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.475
I just took my sleeping pill.
I have an early flight.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.562
-I was looking for your husband.
-I'm sure you were.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.981
I'm sorry to just show up unannounced.

19:09.064 --> 19:12.693
It's just I needed to discuss
some of the details of our transaction,

19:12.776 --> 19:14.153
and it's time-sensitive.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.321
-We hadn't discussed it.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.323
Max and I discuss everything.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.410
He told me what you did.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.704
I'm sorry, what did I do?

19:24.121 --> 19:27.166
He told me you made a pass at him
in Atlanta.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.584
You're kidding, right?

19:29.084 --> 19:31.670
Do you think you're the first tramp
to go after my husband?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.922
They all think he's an easy mark.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.217
Handsome rich older man
stuck in a stale marriage.

19:37.384 --> 19:40.387
But you're married to his nephew,
for God's sake.

19:40.470 --> 19:44.474
If you don't have respect for yourself,
at least have some respect for Liam.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.853
Look, I don't know
what your husband told you,

19:47.936 --> 19:50.439
but he's the one
who's been crossing lines, not me. He's gotten to your head
if you think for one--

20:06.705 --> 20:09.791
<i>Fallon. It's a little late</i>
<i>to be talking business, isn't it?</i>

20:10.125 --> 20:11.126
You're right.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.587
Why don't we talk tomorrow night?

20:14.463 --> 20:16.798
Leave that key with the doorman.
I'll be there.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.183
Good night.
See you.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.269
-Hold up. Hold up.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.522
I know you're closing,
but I think I left my ID in the bathroom.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.024
Can I run in and check?

20:34.691 --> 20:36.777
Really quick? My Uber's gonna leave.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.365
-All right, go ahead.
-Oh, thank you so much.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.225
I'm gonna call you Fallon.

21:17.901 --> 21:21.697
How many people should I be expecting
for this meditation class tonight?

21:21.780 --> 21:24.491
Sammy mentioned something
about it being hosted here.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.077
Yeah, he's really embraced
this whole baby thing.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.080
I'm starting to think
it's not a good idea.

21:30.163 --> 21:32.874
The meditation class?
Or the whole baby thing?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.918
I never have been good at meditation.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.589
I don't wanna screw up another kid with...

21:40.424 --> 21:43.010
-all of this.
-Well, I can assure you, you will.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.096
Thanks for the honesty, I guess.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.390
All parents screw up their kids.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.183
I certainly did.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.520
I'm sure this place had something
to do with it.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.689
Well, I didn't do her any favors, though.

21:56.732 --> 21:57.733
It's too late now.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.485
You owe it to this baby
to give it your best.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.529
And you owe it to yourself.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.493
I'll call Melissa,
find out how many people are coming.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.461
Cubano.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.379
Just trust me.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.508
-It's pretty good.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.595
I used to walk through here on a break
while writing my book.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.306
If my family knew, they probably
would've torn up the whole block.

22:29.389 --> 22:31.850
Speaking of family,
have you talked to your uncle?

22:32.184 --> 22:34.895
Called him this morning.
It was a big misunderstanding.

22:34.978 --> 22:38.815
The Northstone guys heard about the CA
acquisition and asked for the meeting.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.443
-He took it as a courtesy.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.488
He's meeting with his lawyers right now
to sign everything.

22:44.571 --> 22:47.824
Oh, that's perfect. Now I don't have
to cancel my spa appointment.

22:48.825 --> 22:51.661
-I need to get a facial before Monica's.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.040
The city clogs my pores.
I'll meet you on the plane at 8?

22:56.041 --> 22:58.919
Yeah. I might go check out
that Picasso exhibit.

22:59.002 --> 23:02.172
Don't forget to take your ring off.
You might meet a cute art-history major.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.425
See you later.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.010
Bye.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.806
If he can stay in Atlanta one more night,
we'll make it worth his while.

23:10.972 --> 23:12.808
But I need to know in the next hour.

23:13.391 --> 23:14.476
Yeah, call me back.

23:15.060 --> 23:19.022
-Don't tell me they got Beyoncé, too.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.566
They got shut down.
Health-code violations.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.652
Inspector found rats in the kitchen.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.403
How gross is that?

23:26.321 --> 23:27.447
Wait a second.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.408
The Health Department
just happened to be at Purgatory?

23:31.243 --> 23:33.787
Apparently, they got an anonymous tip.

23:34.955 --> 23:38.750
-Like I said, it was anonymous.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.297
I know how important this place is to you.

23:45.006 --> 23:48.385
I want you to know it means a lot to me
that you'd give me a chance.

23:51.012 --> 23:53.723
Maybe we can find a place
for your initiative here.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.811
It's good to see you again, Ally.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.939
-You look great. I mean, so New York.
-Thank you.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.941
I'm still an Atlanta girl at heart.

24:03.108 --> 24:06.236
If you don't mind me asking,
how did you get into the, you know...?

24:06.319 --> 24:08.071
-Yes.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.865
I assume you weren't doing this at Penley.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.993
Oh, God, no.
No, I actually came here for fashion.

24:13.076 --> 24:16.705
Then I started going to parties
and getting requests.

24:17.372 --> 24:21.042
Realized I could make more in a month
than the lawyers and doctors I knew,

24:21.126 --> 24:22.377
so here we are.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.964
Speaking of which, what can I do for you?

24:27.048 --> 24:29.092
Let's just say I have a date tonight,

24:29.176 --> 24:32.304
one I have no intention
of taking to completion,

24:32.762 --> 24:34.598
and I need somebody who can fill in.

24:35.557 --> 24:39.853
-My uncle. In-law. Sort of.

24:39.936 --> 24:43.273
And potential business partner.
Long story short, he's a real prize.

24:43.356 --> 24:46.943
First he tries to get in my pants
even though I'm married to his nephew.

24:47.027 --> 24:50.238
Then last night he convinced his wife
I was hitting on him.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.949
I didn't sign on to this ship of vipers
to become the company whore.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.744
I needed a contingency plan,
somebody on standby.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.038
I'll wine and dine him,
butter him up, but...

24:58.955 --> 25:01.458
if he wants more,
I'll tag out and tag her in.

25:01.541 --> 25:03.335
You think he won't know the difference?

25:04.336 --> 25:07.088
You'll have to get the right girl,
with my measurements.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.633
Have her wear this. When he gets laid,

25:09.716 --> 25:11.468
I get a very important signature

25:11.551 --> 25:13.678
and your girl gets the biggest payday
of her life.

25:13.762 --> 25:14.804
Everyone wins.

25:16.932 --> 25:20.518
Always room for you, my friend.
Glad you can make it out tonight.

25:23.688 --> 25:24.773
Hey, let me call you back.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.613
What are you doing here, Blake?

25:31.988 --> 25:34.950
What are you doing
buying a first

25:35.909 --> 25:38.161
You expect me to believe
it was a coincidence?

25:39.663 --> 25:41.998
Charlie and I are friends. We talk.

25:42.749 --> 25:45.377
The whole town is talking
about your midlife crisis.

25:45.460 --> 25:49.422
No crisis. It's just my turn.
My life has been about everyone else.

25:49.506 --> 25:52.050
You really have the balls
to say that to me?

25:52.133 --> 25:55.345
I'm not here to relitigate the past.
I just want the damn car.

25:56.012 --> 25:58.056
You know you bought it to screw with me.

25:58.431 --> 26:01.393
Fine. I'm happy to pay.
Just name your price.

26:01.476 --> 26:02.477
Not for sale.

26:03.603 --> 26:06.773
It's about time you learned
what the rest of us had to long ago.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.526
-Can't always get what you want.
-Fine.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.405
-I'll race you for it.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.240
One of my gull-wings against yours.

26:15.323 --> 26:19.536
I win, I take your car.
You win, you can have both of mine.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.417
Now, what do you say
we raise the stakes a little

26:26.334 --> 26:27.419
More than just money.

26:31.881 --> 26:32.799
Name it.

26:34.592 --> 26:37.220
Sorry about yesterday.
You caught me off guard.

26:37.304 --> 26:41.141
-I thought you might be testing me.
-Earnest as earnest can be.

26:45.645 --> 26:46.938
I'm just glad you reconsidered.

26:48.773 --> 26:49.816
Me, too.

26:50.233 --> 26:54.654
I have to say, I admire your ingenuity,
convincing Maura to threaten the deal.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.073
Don't worry about Maura.

26:57.782 --> 27:01.619
She's in the country house for a week.
We've got the place to ourselves.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.371
I can give you the grand tour.

27:03.455 --> 27:07.375
Well, maybe you can show me
where you're keeping that signed contract.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.670
You have a one-track mind.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.714
But that's okay. So do I.

27:13.298 --> 27:17.635
I'll have it for you in the morning,
barring any unexpected issues.

27:17.802 --> 27:18.803
Well...

27:21.556 --> 27:23.141
in that case, let's stay here.

27:36.237 --> 27:37.280
Wow.

27:40.825 --> 27:44.120
I have to say,
I like your proposal so far.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.832
-Well, we're just getting started.
-Mmm.

27:52.754 --> 27:53.922
What are you doing now?

27:59.886 --> 28:02.055
The anticipation is killing me.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.432
Give me your hand.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.269
-Just a little jewelry.

28:10.855 --> 28:14.442
I knew you had some tricks up your sleeve.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.987
Well, I might have one more.

28:25.662 --> 28:26.871
Where you going?

28:27.455 --> 28:28.331
Oh...

28:28.832 --> 28:32.836
I'm going to turn on some music.
I like a real sensory experience.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.463
I like the sound of that.

28:39.509 --> 28:40.635
Don't get lost, now.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.097
Don't worry. I'm right here.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.499
This is our chance. Let's go.

29:13.585 --> 29:17.005
Surveillance is one thing.
Breaking and entering is another.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.591
It's not breaking if you have a key.

29:19.674 --> 29:21.926
How did you know there was a key
under the herb box?

29:22.010 --> 29:23.094
We shared a gardener.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.388
Let's just say he wet more
than her plants.

29:25.472 --> 29:28.516
Okay, I have to be
at that meditation class, too,

29:28.600 --> 29:30.852
-so, we should go.
-Sam, this is for Steven.

29:30.935 --> 29:33.354
What if she is lying?
Doesn't he deserve to know?

29:33.980 --> 29:36.191
You check the mail. I'll take the bedroom.

29:58.922 --> 29:59.923
What?

30:00.006 --> 30:01.508
I knew it.

30:03.468 --> 30:04.469
What's that?

30:05.178 --> 30:06.513
A fake baby bump.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.767
But this is way bigger than Melissa's.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.602
She must have one for every stage.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.980
I bet you Goldilocks is wearing one
right now.

30:23.404 --> 30:24.864
That name looks good in neon.

30:29.285 --> 30:30.662
Congratulations, Monny.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.872
Expanding the Colby empire.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.375
I don't need an empire.

30:35.917 --> 30:39.295
-I just need to throw a good party.
Ms. Colby. Quan is here.

30:39.712 --> 30:42.882
Oh. Right on time.
I'm gonna make sure everything is ready.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.930
-Yeah, I'll be there soon.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.640
Gotta take care of something.

30:51.975 --> 30:55.770

31:17.500 --> 31:19.711
As we begin,
I want to thank you all

31:19.794 --> 31:22.839
for bringing your divine energy
into this sacred space.

31:23.339 --> 31:25.425
She's obviously never been here before.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.679
-I don't know where Sam is.
-It's okay. Relax.

31:29.762 --> 31:31.639
As we consider our intentions

31:31.723 --> 31:34.183
for the time and space
we have made together,

31:34.267 --> 31:35.977
we breath in the light

31:36.978 --> 31:39.022
and exhale what is heavy.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.281
Oh, you really went all out.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.742
Thought it'd be more down and dirty.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.493
It's not <i>Tokyo Drift.</i>

31:52.577 --> 31:56.915
I don't wanna damage the cars.
Though that loop-the-loop's pretty filthy.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.336
Rich people are so weird.

32:02.128 --> 32:04.547
You know these toy cars
cost way more than my real one?

32:05.465 --> 32:08.551
Carrington saw them at a dealership,
and Colby bought one to screw with him.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.970
-Like I said.
Should we do this or what?

32:11.054 --> 32:14.724
I'm all for reliving your childhood,
but I got a grown-up party to get to.

32:14.807 --> 32:17.769
First one to the end of the track.
Winner takes all.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.729
I got 50 on Carrington. What the hell.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.816
-I'll take that bet.
-Make it 100.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.818
Let's go, let's go. Let's go, y'all.

32:27.528 --> 32:28.363
Let's go!

32:34.077 --> 32:35.828
Welcome home.
-Thank you.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.499
Didn't realize
you were bringing a plus-one.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.125
I had to come straight from the airport.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.336
He offered me a ride.
It was only polite to invite him.

32:43.419 --> 32:44.379
How's my lipstick?

32:44.671 --> 32:46.589
-Perfect.
-I'm gonna go check.

32:48.758 --> 32:51.469
-I hear congratulations are in order.
-Indeed. Thanks.

32:51.552 --> 32:53.179
Didn't know you were popping the question.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.599
-Four years.

32:57.141 --> 33:02.188
I just hope this thing between Fal and I
didn't make you rush into anything.

33:02.689 --> 33:03.940
How so?

33:04.023 --> 33:06.484
Just that she might not be as excited
as you are.

33:08.069 --> 33:10.196
She's wearing my ring. I'm good, bro.

33:12.031 --> 33:14.867
-I was just saying how gorgeous you look.

33:14.951 --> 33:17.078
You always say that. Should we go in?

33:17.161 --> 33:19.247
I think I'm actually gonna head out.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.708
-Yeah, I'm sure. Have fun, guys. Three, two, one.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.558
Come on, Carrington. Let's go, baby.

33:42.645 --> 33:43.646
Let's go, let's go.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.445
-I got it. Yeah.
No!
-Whoo!

33:56.993 --> 33:58.578
-Whoo!
-No!

33:59.412 --> 34:00.455
Whoo!

34:04.917 --> 34:05.918
A bet's a bet.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.633
Fallon Carrington?
Fancy seeing you here.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.219
You remember me, don't you?

34:15.303 --> 34:18.806
What are you doing here?

34:18.890 --> 34:20.933
Haven't you heard? I'm back.

34:21.601 --> 34:24.270
Is that my dress?
I was supposed to wear that tonight.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.105
Yeah. It looks good, doesn't it?

34:26.731 --> 34:29.942
And my grandma's necklace.
Were you in my house?

34:30.026 --> 34:32.278
-Just like old times.

34:32.361 --> 34:35.782
-Give me my necklace back, psycho.
-When I'm done.

34:35.865 --> 34:37.867
When you're done what?
<i>Single White Female</i>

34:41.120 --> 34:42.288
Let's just go upstairs.

34:47.460 --> 34:48.294
Hey.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.631
Hey, relax.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.514
-That's right, bitch. Come at me.
Security!

34:59.889 --> 35:03.017
And now, as we fall
into the rhythm of our breaths,

35:03.101 --> 35:05.228
we can become conscious of our partners

35:05.728 --> 35:07.814
and bring our rhythms into sync.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.399
Where have you been?

35:13.319 --> 35:14.529
What are you doing here?

35:14.612 --> 35:18.574
I am here to expose you.
The jig is up, you lying bitch.

35:18.991 --> 35:20.868
Get her, please.

35:24.747 --> 35:26.249
-Fallon!

35:28.042 --> 35:28.918
Oh.

35:29.877 --> 35:30.795
-That's--

35:32.797 --> 35:36.175
Keep it.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.468
Maybe when I was 12.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.847
-I want everything.

35:40.930 --> 35:44.058
Everything you took from me
when you had me shipped back to Australia.

35:44.142 --> 35:48.396
I'm gonna take your friends, your family,
your whole damn world.

35:54.193 --> 35:55.403
Is this a joke?

35:56.028 --> 35:58.698
-It's not my fault.
I don't understand.

35:58.781 --> 36:01.909
We both saw the fake baby bump
in your closet.

36:02.410 --> 36:05.454
I have an event in two months.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.957
I needed to be fitted for my dress
ahead of time.

36:08.040 --> 36:11.794
-I was approximating how big I'll be.

36:11.878 --> 36:14.130
I'm having a dinner party.
People need to eat.

36:14.213 --> 36:16.299
It's called being a gracious hostess.

36:16.883 --> 36:20.553
As much as I'd love to stay here and chat
with you about being a lawbreaking psycho,

36:20.636 --> 36:23.639
your son's baby is pushing
on my bladder right now,

36:23.723 --> 36:24.932
so, I'd like to go home.

36:28.644 --> 36:33.024
-It was an innocent misunderstanding.

36:33.608 --> 36:36.485
We should talk about this later,
when you're not so upset.

36:42.491 --> 36:43.868
This was all her.

36:43.951 --> 36:47.038
She manipulated me
and made me think Melissa was a liar.

36:47.121 --> 36:50.249
Don't try to blame this on Alexis.
You're a grown man, supposedly.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.252
You chose to believe your crazy
mother-in-law instead of your husband.

36:57.798 --> 37:01.427
She basically attacked me. Ask anyone.
Or are you gonna frame me for this, too?

37:01.510 --> 37:03.471
I can't believe you'd do this
on opening night.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.057
You know better than anyone
what bad publicity can do.

37:06.140 --> 37:09.143
Monica, you need to fire
this crazy bitch now.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.103
-Get rid of this lunatic

37:11.187 --> 37:12.980
before she burns the place down.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.150
You cause a scene, and you wanna tell me
how to staff my club?

37:16.234 --> 37:19.528
I mean, I am the one that paid for it
in the first place.

37:20.821 --> 37:22.531
And you'll never let me forget it.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.076
To solve that problem, here's a check...

37:28.079 --> 37:29.413
for 3.5 million.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.000
That's everything you paid plus interest.

37:35.336 --> 37:39.173
And as far as who I fire, that's my call,
'cause this is my club.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.425
And Kirby doesn't even work here.

37:45.346 --> 37:46.514
Let's get out of here.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.643
Can't say I didn't warn you.
That's one down.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.566
Monica. What is going on?

37:57.650 --> 37:59.652
My friends keep texting me
that people are fighting.

37:59.735 --> 38:03.656
I took care of it while you were out
playing kids' games with Blake Carrington.

38:03.739 --> 38:05.408
Who I thought we were moving on from.

38:05.491 --> 38:08.995
Maybe you should deal with
whatever identity crisis you have going on

38:09.078 --> 38:10.538
and leave me alone, okay?

38:16.877 --> 38:19.672
I took the liberty
of calling the private nurse, sir.

38:19.755 --> 38:20.923
I don't need a nurse.

38:21.007 --> 38:23.592
I bruised my hand racing toy cars.
I know--

38:25.261 --> 38:26.262
It may be broken.

38:27.930 --> 38:31.684
Fortunately, the nurse that I called
is waiting for you in your office.

38:32.351 --> 38:37.064
I assume, from the injury, that the race
didn't work out how you expected?

38:39.025 --> 38:40.026
It did not.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.653
-I lost.
-Well, I'm relieved to hear it.

38:42.987 --> 38:43.988
Excuse me?

38:44.071 --> 38:47.491
Well, if you'll excuse the metaphor,
you're behaving like a child.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.952
Throwing tantrums,
spinning out of control,

38:50.036 --> 38:51.287
all over some toys.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.457
I bought those toy cars for you.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.292
-Yeah.

38:56.375 --> 38:59.378
They reminded me of the days we spent
together racing them when I was a kid.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.340
You were always around
when my father was who-knows-where.

39:02.423 --> 39:03.924
I was gonna give you the set.

39:04.759 --> 39:05.926
Well, I'm touched, sir.

39:06.552 --> 39:08.554
Well, they're gone now. So, get over it.

39:08.637 --> 39:11.766
Blake, are you okay?
I heard you were injured.

39:13.726 --> 39:17.521
Ooh. We should get some ice on that.
Or is it heat?

39:17.605 --> 39:18.773
Anyway, come upstairs.

39:18.856 --> 39:22.860
Despite your lengthy stay in hospital,
we have a real nurse in there.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.362
Good evening.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.124
There's been a misunderstanding.
I'm not a nurse.

39:37.458 --> 39:41.712
I tried to explain at the front gate,
but he assumed I was and let me in.

39:42.755 --> 39:43.923
And I needed to talk to you.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.967
-My name is Cristal Jennings.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.930
I was a friend of your late wife,
Cristal Flores.

39:51.263 --> 39:52.807
You're the woman on the phone.

39:53.516 --> 39:54.517
Oh, God.

39:56.435 --> 39:58.104
However you got in here,
you can go.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.022
Tell me how much you want.
I'll write a check.

40:00.106 --> 40:01.857
No, no, no. I don't want anything.

40:06.153 --> 40:07.196
Here.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.199
Look.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.791
I think she wanted me to come here
and help you.

40:18.874 --> 40:21.001
<i>♪ I know that you love me ♪</i>

40:21.085 --> 40:22.628
I think you can help me, too.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.256
<i>♪ Though I'm young and stupid ♪</i>

40:26.590 --> 40:29.969
You sure you're okay?
I'm great.

40:30.052 --> 40:33.514
I got to show everyone
that Fallon is kind of unhinged,

40:33.597 --> 40:34.932
and she ripped my dress,

40:35.015 --> 40:38.477
which was actually hers,
so, seems like a win-win.

40:41.856 --> 40:45.943
I'm learning that at some point
you gotta leave grudges in the past.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.530
Otherwise, you start pissing off
new people.

40:52.700 --> 40:53.784
Like Monica.

40:54.743 --> 40:56.996
Who's probably here
to chew me out some more.

40:57.079 --> 40:59.373
Or fire me from a job I never even had.

41:03.836 --> 41:05.463
-That's me.

41:06.547 --> 41:07.590
How can I help you?

41:07.673 --> 41:09.884
You're under arrest
for assault on Fallon Carrington.

41:11.051 --> 41:15.723
<i>♪ I'm just doing what I can ♪</i>

41:15.806 --> 41:17.183
You're pretty good at this.

41:17.266 --> 41:19.768
What other hidden talents do you have
that I don't know about?

41:19.852 --> 41:22.480
You'll have to wait
and discover them along the way.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.442
Now, if we can just get this deal done,
Liam gone...

41:26.525 --> 41:28.486
-I thought you trusted me.
-I do.

41:28.569 --> 41:31.655
Okay, then don't worry, babe.
I can take care of myself.

41:32.198 --> 41:33.908
Although I like it
when you take care of me.

41:35.409 --> 41:36.744
-Ooh.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.122
This may be the call
we've been waiting for.

41:41.373 --> 41:42.249
Hello?

41:42.333 --> 41:44.919
Is this Fallon? I'm sorry.
I didn't know what to do.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.587
Slow down. What's going on?

41:47.046 --> 41:49.256
That guy,
he was blindfolded and handcuffed,

41:49.340 --> 41:51.217
-and he wanted me to gag him.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.427
<i>He started freaking out,</i>
<i>so, I took out the gag.</i>

41:53.511 --> 41:56.764
He was turning red. He couldn't breathe.
He said he was having a heart attack.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.891
-No.

41:58.974 --> 42:00.809
It was all so fast,
and then it was too late.
