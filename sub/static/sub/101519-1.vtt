WEBVTT

24:45.068 --> 24:46.445
Follow me.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.042
How is he feeling?

27:32.945 --> 27:34.947
...cruel violence is spreading

27:35.030 --> 27:37.741
throughout the German occupied Europe.

27:38.408 --> 27:44.581
The crime of Hitler... the crimes cannot be
tolerated by our beloved country.

29:13.086 --> 29:15.088
May I borrow your newspaper?

29:15.172 --> 29:16.673
I left mine on the bus.

31:12.247 --> 31:16.752
There are informants everywhere.
We just want to keep our families safe.

31:25.552 --> 31:27.638
What can we do?

31:40.400 --> 31:43.445
Jean will meet you tonight
to print two thousand copies.

31:43.529 --> 31:44.905
I’ll take care of it.

31:45.447 --> 31:47.282
Distribute these amongst the workers.

43:31.778 --> 43:33.780
May we speak?

43:33.864 --> 43:34.907
I’m not interested.

45:25.142 --> 45:25.976
Yes?

45:26.059 --> 45:28.187
We identified an illegal radio signal
from your home.

45:28.854 --> 45:29.938
I don’t have a radio.

45:32.441 --> 45:34.234
Please, come in.

45:35.277 --> 45:39.656
- I know he is here
- May I offer you something to eat?

49:59.833 --> 50:02.294
Don’t believe this propaganda madam.

50:03.003 --> 50:06.131
The Germans are the enemy... not the Jews.

51:53.447 --> 51:54.865
I’m a new patient.

51:54.948 --> 51:56.074
For Dr. Chevain?

51:56.158 --> 51:58.285
No Dr. Benoit.

52:01.496 --> 52:03.207
Father Robert Alesch.

52:03.290 --> 52:05.000
Your sermons are legendary.

52:10.547 --> 52:12.508
We can’t stand by with our arms folded.

52:12.591 --> 52:13.967
Indeed.

52:15.844 --> 52:17.262
I’m looking for Brigitte?

52:18.889 --> 52:21.099
Do you have a message for her?

52:21.183 --> 52:22.976
I need to see her.

52:25.562 --> 52:27.314
I’m sorry, Father, but...

52:28.982 --> 52:30.317
I apologize for the inconvenience.

52:32.861 --> 52:36.198
Perhaps you can return another time?

52:37.115 --> 52:39.785
I can’t promise,
but I’ve heard Brigitte might be in town.

52:40.077 --> 52:44.665
There is a double agent in Bordeaux.
All my contacts have been arrested.

52:45.082 --> 52:46.416
Who knows if any of them have talked.

52:46.875 --> 52:51.421
I need protection,
a disguise and money to rebuild a network.

52:52.798 --> 52:54.299
I’ve heard about Brigitte.

52:54.591 --> 52:55.884
If you see her, please--

52:55.968 --> 52:57.928
I’ll pass along the message.

52:58.220 --> 52:59.346
It’s urgent.

52:59.721 --> 53:00.639
I understand.

1:00:38.972 --> 1:00:40.933
It look’s beautiful, doesn’t it?

1:01:41.410 --> 1:01:43.954
Boarding
Train for Paris!

1:02:16.653 --> 1:02:19.114
Search everything.
Everybody off the train!

1:02:21.658 --> 1:02:23.327
Everybody off, bring your luggage!

1:02:54.233 --> 1:02:56.443
We found her!

1:03:07.871 --> 1:03:09.540
Everybody back on the train!

1:03:48.203 --> 1:03:50.664
I won’t be long.

1:04:16.899 --> 1:04:18.442
8, rue des Archers

1:05:37.521 --> 1:05:40.315
This will be helpful.

1:06:07.676 --> 1:06:09.553
In the center, right?

1:07:01.730 --> 1:07:03.232
We’ve finally caught you.

1:07:12.950 --> 1:07:14.284
You must go!

1:07:14.368 --> 1:07:16.370
It’s too dangerous here!

1:09:49.523 --> 1:09:52.568
What, a woman with a wooden leg?
She will slow us down.

1:09:53.026 --> 1:09:54.278
I’m telling you she cannot do it.

1:09:54.361 --> 1:09:55.571
It’s not going to work.

1:12:30.434 --> 1:12:31.852
Stop!

1:12:33.145 --> 1:12:34.646
It’s the police!

1:12:35.939 --> 1:12:37.524
I said stop!

1:15:22.439 --> 1:15:24.191
What do you have there?

1:15:43.919 --> 1:15:46.588
Good. Let’s play.

1:15:46.672 --> 1:15:48.841
It’s for the prisoner, sir.

1:15:48.924 --> 1:15:52.052
They can have it when we’re done.
Put it down here.

1:16:39.725 --> 1:16:43.729
Let’s pack it up for tonight.
But I’ll be back tomorrow for a rematch.

1:16:55.407 --> 1:16:56.909
Bring her to the prisoners.

1:17:12.799 --> 1:17:14.259
To pass the time tonight.

1:17:14.343 --> 1:17:17.012
That’s nice of you.

1:17:19.932 --> 1:17:21.141
Lights out!

1:17:41.537 --> 1:17:42.663
Thank God!

1:17:44.373 --> 1:17:45.374
Let’s go.

1:18:03.725 --> 1:18:04.977
What is going on here?

1:18:06.186 --> 1:18:09.314
Is there a problem, sir?

1:18:12.860 --> 1:18:14.695
What are you all doing past curfew hour?

1:18:16.363 --> 1:18:17.865
We don’t want to cause trouble.

1:18:22.077 --> 1:18:25.581
Get on your knees, all of you. Now!

1:18:27.833 --> 1:18:28.834
Sir, there’s a misunderstanding.

1:18:33.589 --> 1:18:35.632
Your accent... it’s not from around here.

1:21:29.681 --> 1:21:31.683
I thought it was you!

1:21:31.767 --> 1:21:33.101
Oh my God! How are you?

1:21:36.021 --> 1:21:38.315
What are you doing here?

1:21:39.191 --> 1:21:40.442
It’s complicated.

1:21:40.526 --> 1:21:42.236
You look like you could
really use a cup of tea.

1:21:42.319 --> 1:21:44.613
Yes, that would be lovely.

1:21:45.364 --> 1:21:47.533
I’m so happy to see you.

1:21:47.616 --> 1:21:49.952
You can’t even imagine.

1:21:57.376 --> 1:22:03.298
I’ve been sleeping in alleys for days.
I have nowhere to go.

1:22:05.217 --> 1:22:06.260
Can you help me?

1:22:07.511 --> 1:22:11.014
I have a family, Noor.
If anyone finds out...

1:22:11.098 --> 1:22:13.559
Giselle, thousands of Jews are disappearing.

1:22:14.101 --> 1:22:17.563
Now innocent French children
are being marked with yellow stars.

1:22:18.730 --> 1:22:20.357
Aren’t you afraid?

1:22:23.151 --> 1:22:25.988
Please... for France?

1:22:30.242 --> 1:22:31.076
A few days.

1:22:32.035 --> 1:22:33.537
That’s all I can offer you.

1:23:27.299 --> 1:23:31.637
<i>Roosevelt’s decision,
committing U.S. troops to aid the British</i>

1:23:31.720 --> 1:23:36.934
<i>in the seizure of French North Africa has
culminated in a major defeat to the Axis.</i>

1:23:37.017 --> 1:23:39.186
<i>Having lost control of the Mediterranean,</i>

1:23:39.478 --> 1:23:47.027
<i>Hitler’s forces are gathering on the frontiers of
Southern France to occupy the rest of France.</i>

1:24:36.994 --> 1:24:39.371
Klaus Barbie has arrived!

1:25:05.063 --> 1:25:08.525
I’d do anything to get my hands
on that limping bitch’s throat.

1:25:10.819 --> 1:25:13.030
Distribute these fliers. All over France.

1:25:23.999 --> 1:25:26.168
Tone it down on those sermons.

1:25:26.668 --> 1:25:31.215
This is new for me.
I wanted to be convincing, Herr Barbie...

1:25:31.298 --> 1:25:32.925
Do not disparage the Führer’s name!

1:25:36.595 --> 1:25:43.227
...so no one suspects anything. My apologies.

1:25:52.027 --> 1:25:52.986
Your bonus.

1:25:57.074 --> 1:25:59.243
I paid for both of your whores in Paris, as well.

1:26:01.828 --> 1:26:03.455
Find me this woman.

1:27:30.417 --> 1:27:32.711
This is the punishment for anyone...

1:27:33.045 --> 1:27:35.714
who is caught aiding spies
and betraying the Führer.

1:28:45.951 --> 1:28:47.411
Where is she?

1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:50.330
You are asking me questions
and I do not know the answers.

1:28:50.998 --> 1:28:53.125
Why would she have told me anything?

1:28:53.417 --> 1:28:54.501
I am a doctor.

1:28:54.877 --> 1:28:56.920
I am healing people, that’s it.

1:29:12.853 --> 1:29:13.854
Where is she?

1:29:14.438 --> 1:29:15.522
I don’t know.

1:30:08.909 --> 1:30:10.577
This is what we do with spies.

1:31:51.803 --> 1:31:52.846
What have you done?

1:31:52.930 --> 1:31:53.972
I did this for you.

1:31:54.515 --> 1:31:55.682
For you to eat.

1:32:45.816 --> 1:32:48.443
Move it you dirty whore! Keep moving.

1:34:54.570 --> 1:34:57.406
Loyalty. It’s overrated.

1:35:09.626 --> 1:35:12.254
Start transmitting as Madeline.

1:38:26.990 --> 1:38:28.867
She’s heading South... Pyrenees.

1:39:41.773 --> 1:39:45.944
She’s tried to escape twice.
We can’t get anything out of her.

1:39:50.365 --> 1:39:52.159
Put her on the next van.

1:44:01.491 --> 1:44:02.576
You did it!
