02:58.778 --> 03:02.509
Hey, you!
Aren't you Youngho?

03:03.783 --> 03:07.378
It's really been a long time.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.352
- Pleased to meet you, Youngho.
- Me, too

03:09.455 --> 03:12.015
What have you been doing?

03:12.091 --> 03:14.616
It's really him!

03:14.694 --> 03:17.197
- Welcome to hometown.
- You still remember me.

03:17.197 --> 03:21.156
- Of course we remember you.
- It's really been a long time.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.066
You remember this girl?

03:25.138 --> 03:27.674
Chong Oksun, who always
fell asleep during class.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.040
- How are you doing?
- This is Kim Mihwa with the frog lips.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.077
- It's Lee Mihwa.
- Lee Mihwa.

03:32.178 --> 03:34.544
Dr. Pimple, Shin Jongja.

03:34.614 --> 03:37.105
Now, the wife of the chief of
a bus company.

03:38.184 --> 03:39.208
Hi!

03:39.285 --> 03:41.276
Nice to meet you again.

03:42.922 --> 03:45.254
Let's have a seat and drink.

03:50.863 --> 03:56.358
- Hey.
- Sit down. Have a drink.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.666
We really wanted to contact you,

04:02.041 --> 04:05.602
but we couldn't.

04:05.945 --> 04:06.912
It's all right.

04:07.013 --> 04:10.972
I'm the one who should
be sorry for not calling you.

04:11.117 --> 04:15.577
This guy's the head
of our friendship association now.

04:15.688 --> 04:18.350
- Bongwoo club.
- Right, Bongwoo club.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.752
I am really sorry
for not contacting you.

04:21.661 --> 04:22.923
I said I am all right.

04:23.263 --> 04:27.495
I've really tried to reach you,
you've been always on my mind.

04:27.700 --> 04:31.932
But no one knows
your whereabouts.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.596
I'm sorry.

04:37.243 --> 04:40.542
It's more difficult than I thought

04:41.147 --> 04:43.411
to gather friends after 20 years past.

04:43.516 --> 04:44.244
Yeah, right

04:44.350 --> 04:45.908
Just if I knew where you...

04:46.019 --> 04:47.680
I said I am OK, I mean it.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.490
Don't worry about me, any more.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.724
We need to break the ice, here.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.563
May I sing a song?

05:00.700 --> 05:02.964
Of course,
you can. Go ahead.

05:08.741 --> 05:16.443
¢Ü Na na na na
Na na na Na na na

05:16.649 --> 05:24.522
¢Ü Na na na na
Na na na Na na na

05:24.757 --> 05:31.890
¢Ü What should I do,
you left so suddenly,

05:32.465 --> 05:39.598
¢Ü What should I do,
I can't live without you.

05:39.872 --> 05:47.005
¢Ü What should I do,
you left me behind,

05:47.747 --> 05:54.516
¢Ü That won't do, really.
Please don't go.

05:54.987 --> 06:10.062
¢Ü Did you have a secret
that no one knew?

06:10.203 --> 06:13.730
¢Ü You were the one so tender...

06:13.806 --> 06:15.569
Now we bring
the next singer here.

06:15.641 --> 06:22.376
Mrs. Jung, Madam!
Madam! Please!

06:25.284 --> 06:31.848
¢Ü Nil li li ya Nil li li
Nil li li Mambo

06:32.458 --> 06:39.387
¢Ü Nil li li ya Nil li li
Nil li li Mambo

06:39.665 --> 06:46.400
¢Ü My beautiful lover
never comes,

06:47.073 --> 06:53.911
¢Ü without a gale and I hate that.

06:54.046 --> 07:01.179
¢Ü I wish I knew
where my lover is,

07:01.587 --> 07:08.254
¢Ü to send him an umbrella.

07:08.728 --> 07:15.292
¢Ü Nil li li ya Nil li li
Nil li li Mambo

08:05.485 --> 08:07.248
Do you remember
where that guy used to work?

08:07.520 --> 08:09.818
He'd worked for Tae-hwa Elec.,
before joining the army.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.217
It's passed 20 years since then.

08:12.458 --> 08:15.222
Oh, my face turns red badly!

08:15.328 --> 08:19.662
You've got autumn leaves
in this spring day.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.696
- Looks wonderful.
- Looks wonderful.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.467
Look at that! Shouldn't
we try to get him down?

08:26.572 --> 08:28.699
Leave him alone.
He should stop in time.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.799
- You're right.
- It's dangerous.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.775
Let him down.

08:32.945 --> 08:39.077
- Come down!
- Come down, have a drink!

08:43.556 --> 08:45.524
Come down, I say!

08:46.626 --> 08:50.585
- Do something!
- A train's coming! Hurry down!

08:50.663 --> 08:53.791
- Hey! Hurry down! Danger!
- Don't care about him any more.

08:54.033 --> 08:58.470
- Hey! Hurry down!
- It's a train! Hurry down.

08:58.838 --> 09:01.534
- Kim Youngho!
- He won't hear us.

09:01.641 --> 09:05.407
- Come down, you bastard!
- Hurry down, please.

09:05.478 --> 09:09.608
Don't worry. Ten to one
who went to Han river

09:09.815 --> 09:12.010
with suicidal intent didn't die.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.779
Kim Youngho!

09:14.554 --> 09:16.852
Kim Youngho, come down!

09:33.573 --> 09:36.804
That man is too much!

09:37.076 --> 09:40.637
- Hey! Hurry down, you bastard!
- I gave up.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.510
You win. Do as you like,
you crazy fool!

09:43.683 --> 09:45.310
Let's dance.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.845
Let's liven up!

09:55.861 --> 10:00.298
Hey! Come down!

10:01.133 --> 10:06.400
What is the matter?
Come down and have a talk.

11:03.929 --> 11:09.561
Kim Youngho.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.932
Kim Youngho!

11:27.687 --> 11:33.216
I am going back!

12:13.099 --> 12:15.201
The Camera

12:15.201 --> 12:19.570
The Camera
Three Days Ago, Spring 1999

12:20.339 --> 12:22.603
It's a group formed
when we worked in factory.

12:22.675 --> 12:26.042
Aha, that's the association
named Bongwoo club, Right?

12:26.112 --> 12:28.637
Right, so we decide to reunite
for the first time

12:28.914 --> 12:30.472
in about 20 years

12:30.583 --> 12:32.312
- To go on a picnic.
- Did you say a picnic?

12:32.418 --> 12:35.387
Yes. That's why I am calling
to you, to announce this event.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.115
Then, you chose the right place

12:37.223 --> 12:40.056
to give notice to your members.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.093
Thank you.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.923
I hope all of your members

12:43.729 --> 12:45.219
listen to this program

12:45.297 --> 12:47.060
and join the picnic.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.301
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

12:49.301 --> 12:50.996
OK. Start.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.868
The members of Bongwoo club

12:53.939 --> 12:55.964
who lived in Garibongdong

12:56.041 --> 12:58.771
20 years ago,

12:59.145 --> 13:01.613
are to meet together this time,

13:01.680 --> 13:03.511
to go on a picnic to the place

13:03.582 --> 13:06.107
Where we first had an excursion.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.709
So, Bongwoo club members

13:07.787 --> 13:11.553
listening to this program, please...

14:02.308 --> 14:04.401
- Are you from Seoul?
- Yes.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.511
I'm here to sell you the goods.

14:07.913 --> 14:11.542
- Money first please.
- Let me see the goods first.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.515
Here it is. Money first.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.146
Give it to me, you bastard!

14:47.987 --> 14:51.115
Not expensive for a thousand won.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.058
It costs a fifteen hundred

14:54.260 --> 14:57.127
at that rest area down below,
but the scenery's better here.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.630
You're right.
The scenery is to die for,

15:00.833 --> 15:02.596
and this coffee is really delicious.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.436
Wait a sec...

15:09.508 --> 15:11.874
Oh no, something's wrong!

15:12.144 --> 15:13.008
What?

15:13.145 --> 15:15.375
I forgot to bring money with me

15:15.547 --> 15:18.311
except credit cards.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.818
- What should I do?
- Look again, carefully.

15:21.887 --> 15:25.345
I forgot to draw some money
from the bank.

15:25.724 --> 15:27.316
I am so sorry.

15:27.526 --> 15:30.017
You won't believe me
to pay back next time, will you?

15:32.131 --> 15:33.894
Here, let me return this to you.

15:37.036 --> 15:39.231
It's already become useless.

15:41.907 --> 15:44.933
- Go ahead, have the rest.
- Thank you.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.338
I promise you
to pay for it next time.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.772
Look and smile.
Say Kim-chi.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.852
- Excuse me.
- One, two, three!

17:36.288 --> 17:38.722
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Hi.

18:34.546 --> 18:37.515
Uh... Kim!

18:38.117 --> 18:39.778
What are you doing?

19:12.417 --> 19:16.786
Are you the owner of this car?

19:17.256 --> 19:18.223
Yes.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.088
You're not allowed to park here.

19:21.426 --> 19:22.916
Your driver's license, please.

19:23.762 --> 19:28.096
- Show me your driver's license.
- This isn't my car.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.068
You said it was your car.

19:31.970 --> 19:33.733
This isn't a stolen car, is it?

19:34.173 --> 19:38.576
- Take out your identification card!
- What for?

19:38.644 --> 19:40.544
Your identification card,
right this moment!

19:51.190 --> 19:53.522
Stop! Stop there!

20:03.235 --> 20:06.500
- Who is it?
- It's me.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.442
Why are you here?

20:25.524 --> 20:27.219
Saemin?

20:28.660 --> 20:29.957
She's asleep.

20:34.299 --> 20:37.029
I asked why you came
without any reason.

20:42.708 --> 20:46.610
Poppy. I wanted to see Poppy.

20:56.054 --> 20:58.022
Poppy...

21:10.435 --> 21:14.166
That's enough, now.
Poppy! Go! Get back in!

21:20.178 --> 21:24.512
Why? Why?

22:50.635 --> 22:52.159
Kim Youngho.

22:57.242 --> 22:59.039
You're Kim Youngho, right?

23:07.786 --> 23:09.913
Move there.
I'll try it.

23:16.595 --> 23:19.462
Why are you carrying
so many keys like these?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.605
Now, you can get in.

23:50.896 --> 23:52.193
Come on in!

24:11.516 --> 24:13.746
Have a seat. Apologies for
such shabby hospitality.

24:19.357 --> 24:22.758
It was a difficultjob
tracking you down.

24:24.029 --> 24:26.657
It's leaking in a new place.
Last night, the rain fell on

24:27.199 --> 24:30.066
my forehead, as I lay in bed.

24:32.337 --> 24:35.033
You, sit down! Fucker!

24:37.008 --> 24:39.408
This isn't a game, sit!

24:47.285 --> 24:49.810
Isn't the way I live pathetic?

24:52.190 --> 24:54.920
Wonder why I live this way?

24:57.562 --> 25:03.626
Although I don't know
who sent you,

25:03.835 --> 25:05.928
I want to talk with you.

25:06.938 --> 25:10.032
It's a good mood, isn't it?

25:11.576 --> 25:13.339
Want a drink?

25:16.047 --> 25:19.175
But there's no booze here.

25:21.720 --> 25:26.589
With the last bit of
my money, I bought this.

25:26.791 --> 25:29.259
To kill just one guy with.

25:31.763 --> 25:34.459
I don't want to die alone.

25:34.833 --> 25:38.394
I need one bastard to come with me.

25:39.271 --> 25:43.139
Just one bastard among
all that ruined my life.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.806
But then...

25:47.612 --> 25:49.705
Who should I kill?

25:50.849 --> 25:53.909
It gives me hard time, you know

25:55.253 --> 26:00.850
Pick just one is hard thing to do.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.095
The fucking stock broker

26:04.095 --> 26:07.360
who made me go clean broke?

26:07.599 --> 26:09.726
The vampire like loan shark that

26:09.801 --> 26:11.826
charged the ridiculous interest?

26:11.903 --> 26:13.302
Or...

26:14.472 --> 26:17.464
How about the business partner

26:18.443 --> 26:21.173
who run away with my money?

26:29.588 --> 26:31.385
Or should I take my ex-wife

26:38.096 --> 26:40.064
and my kid

26:41.466 --> 26:43.525
to die with me?

26:44.603 --> 26:47.663
There're so many fuckers

26:47.806 --> 26:51.037
in my life that it's hard to

26:52.077 --> 26:54.443
pick just one.

26:55.814 --> 26:56.974
You!

27:01.152 --> 27:03.643
I don't know why you're here.

27:04.055 --> 27:06.250
This isn't just your day.

27:10.061 --> 27:11.289
Choose!

27:12.697 --> 27:15.564
Want to watch? Or leave now?

27:25.777 --> 27:29.508
You know Yun Sunnim, don't you?

27:32.250 --> 27:33.342
Who?

27:36.054 --> 27:40.514
Yun-Sun-lm.
I was sent by her.

27:43.094 --> 27:44.994
Who is Yun Sunnim?

27:46.031 --> 27:48.261
Don't you remember?

27:50.035 --> 27:52.265
You two...

27:56.408 --> 27:58.638
liked each other before.

28:00.078 --> 28:04.845
Oh! Yun Sunnim.

28:07.218 --> 28:09.550
But why is she looking for me?

28:10.722 --> 28:12.212
Who are you?

28:12.424 --> 28:16.520
I'm her husband.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.258
She wants to...

28:25.704 --> 28:28.366
...see you.

28:30.108 --> 28:32.576
You're joking, right?

28:34.813 --> 28:37.304
Why does she want to see me?

29:06.277 --> 29:08.245
Will you do me a favor?

29:10.048 --> 29:11.242
What is it?

29:11.483 --> 29:14.816
I bought some clothes this morning.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.145
I hope they fit you well, Mr. Kim.

29:18.223 --> 29:21.192
You're saying
I should wear this?

29:24.596 --> 29:27.463
You wanna put me in trouble, huh?

30:27.859 --> 30:29.417
What's that?

30:29.661 --> 30:32.289
Can't be going to see someone
in the hospital empty handed.

30:39.504 --> 30:42.337
Want one?

30:42.473 --> 30:48.207
It's a peppermint candy.
Really delicious.

31:11.135 --> 31:12.534
What's wrong?

31:18.576 --> 31:21.272
I was told that she lost
her conscious this morning.

31:28.753 --> 31:31.847
She could even talk to me last night.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.491
Too late.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.791
I know, but...

31:46.871 --> 31:49.066
I want to see her face, though.

32:41.125 --> 32:44.686
Honey, Youngho has come.

33:11.089 --> 33:12.989
Sunim...

33:16.194 --> 33:17.786
It's been a long time.

33:39.784 --> 33:43.185
Do you remember this?
Peppermint candy.

33:45.423 --> 33:49.860
When I was in the army,
You sent these to me.

33:50.628 --> 33:54.120
You put a candy in every letters.

33:56.401 --> 34:02.033
I've saved them.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.206
In fact...

34:08.312 --> 34:12.646
I got in trouble owing to them.

34:13.217 --> 34:17.949
As you sent back then...

34:23.261 --> 34:24.489
Look!

34:27.431 --> 34:29.661
They're still in the same shape.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.109
I'm sorry, Sunnim.

35:32.029 --> 35:33.360
Kim Youngho!

35:33.598 --> 35:34.929
Kim Youngho!

35:38.236 --> 35:40.602
I forgot to give something to you.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.608
She wanted me to give you this.

35:43.608 --> 35:45.735
She said it's not hers, but yours.

35:46.844 --> 35:49.836
She also said she was
just keeping it for you.

36:10.735 --> 36:15.832
It's so old. Nobody uses
a 20 years old camera.

36:16.741 --> 36:18.766
Think who wants to use
a manual camera these days?

36:18.943 --> 36:22.538
- How much can you give me?
- I will pay for 30,000 won.

36:27.018 --> 36:31.717
How can you fix just 30,000 won?

36:31.856 --> 36:33.790
You'd better look for another shop.

36:36.894 --> 36:41.024
- How about 50,000 won?
- 40,000 won. It's the maximum.

36:45.670 --> 36:46.830
Okay, then.

37:10.194 --> 37:12.754
Hey, Mr.!

37:13.631 --> 37:16.657
Film in the camera.
Take it back!

38:47.591 --> 38:49.660
Life is Beautiful

38:49.660 --> 38:54.029
Life is Beautiful
Summer 1994

38:59.003 --> 39:01.665
Miss Lee? You came early.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.800
No phone calls yet?

39:05.443 --> 39:06.535
Who?

39:08.212 --> 39:09.645
And so...

39:11.082 --> 39:14.051
Why do they want to be paid

39:14.118 --> 39:16.143
before giving us the goods?

39:16.420 --> 39:18.081
If he calls, refuse it.

39:18.956 --> 39:23.916
No. I'd better take care of it. What?

39:25.029 --> 39:27.190
Why are you saying like that?

39:28.766 --> 39:32.395
What? I can't talk to you that way?

39:36.874 --> 39:42.039
My business dull now a days.
It makes me crazy.

39:43.848 --> 39:46.373
Let's have a drink.

39:46.550 --> 39:50.680
I have to buy... No way,

39:50.955 --> 39:53.287
I should be the one
to buy you drinks...

39:54.325 --> 39:57.920
If you insist that way,
then I won't see you.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.468
She said she's going to get
a driving lesson.

40:10.441 --> 40:12.602
I don't know where.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.074
Anyway...

40:18.616 --> 40:23.053
Make sure she doesn't notice you,
When you're following her. Call me.

40:28.659 --> 40:31.355
Hey! Give me a cup of coffee.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.418
Yes, sir.

40:39.970 --> 40:44.839
Kim, what's making you feel good?
Have they gone up again?

40:45.743 --> 40:49.645
Tire has gone up by 300 won.

40:51.382 --> 40:56.081
300won's not a small amount at all.
You're making money at stocks

40:56.687 --> 41:00.555
as well as at your business.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.161
- Hey!
- Yes, sir?

41:07.598 --> 41:10.032
Who do you think, I am?

41:11.135 --> 41:12.329
You are the president.

41:12.503 --> 41:16.769
Right. I'm the owner. Then, why did you
brought coffee without a saucer?

41:19.343 --> 41:26.306
- I am sorry, sir.
- ¢Ü you've betrayed me...

41:26.383 --> 41:28.442
That's enough.

41:28.853 --> 41:30.821
Buy me a lunch!

41:30.921 --> 41:34.652
¢Ü betrayal of love...

41:36.927 --> 41:41.057
- Where should we go?
- Well, where should we go?

41:41.265 --> 41:44.098
- Wondang'll be difficult to be reached.
- Yeah, there must be congestion.

41:50.407 --> 41:52.204
Jesus, Are your keys ok?

41:52.510 --> 41:54.978
Why do you carry
so many keys?

41:55.346 --> 41:56.108
President!

41:56.280 --> 41:58.771
- Who? Me?
- No, Kim.

41:59.216 --> 42:01.207
- Phone calls for you.
- Who is it?

42:01.285 --> 42:05.221
- It's from the detective agency.
- Detective agency? Why?

42:05.623 --> 42:07.955
I think I can't eat out today.
Let me treat you a lunch next time.

42:08.025 --> 42:10.255
What are you talking about?

42:13.597 --> 42:17.055
Wait, wait. I'm going.

42:20.871 --> 42:22.133
Okay.

42:22.239 --> 42:25.231
Good, that's good! Oh, no! Stop it!

42:26.810 --> 42:30.769
I step on it, what am I gonna do?

43:04.381 --> 43:07.680
- Who is it?
- I ordered cigarettes.

43:08.586 --> 43:11.578
- What is it?
- Where is she, you bastard!

43:33.877 --> 43:36.744
Where do you think you're going!

43:47.625 --> 43:53.757
You fucker!

44:51.455 --> 44:53.082
Are you going home now?

44:55.392 --> 44:56.324
Yes.

44:59.897 --> 45:01.626
Aren't you going home?

45:01.865 --> 45:03.799
Later.

45:06.103 --> 45:07.730
How are you getting home?

45:14.511 --> 45:16.376
I can grab a taxi over there.

45:16.547 --> 45:17.946
Umm... okay

45:19.283 --> 45:20.614
Go then.

45:22.486 --> 45:24.078
Go.

45:25.823 --> 45:28.986
- Are you coming home early?
- No, I'll be late today.

46:01.992 --> 46:05.951
Where have you been keeping
a person waiting so long?

46:06.597 --> 46:08.997
Why didn't you go to eat?

46:09.600 --> 46:12.296
How can I enjoy a meal alone?

46:12.870 --> 46:15.430
- Didn't you have anything to eat, yet?
- Yes, I ate something.

47:09.326 --> 47:10.850
This tastes pretty good.

47:11.461 --> 47:13.725
Eating again?

47:13.931 --> 47:17.367
I eat after intensive exercise.

47:22.372 --> 47:25.398
- What's wrong?
- Mosquitos.

47:25.576 --> 47:27.976
My hip's bitten up by mosquitos.

47:30.848 --> 47:34.477
Those mosqitos bit only my butt.

47:35.586 --> 47:37.554
It was really painful.

48:02.246 --> 48:05.682
Jaeyong, it's not polite
to bother people.

48:07.551 --> 48:10.315
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

48:10.454 --> 48:12.684
Not to play with a ball inside.

48:12.856 --> 48:15.484
Your boy's very cute.

48:16.426 --> 48:21.227
Uh... Hi!

48:21.365 --> 48:23.959
Hi!

48:27.204 --> 48:28.762
It's been a long time.

48:31.041 --> 48:32.508
Are you out with your family?

48:32.676 --> 48:37.238
Yes, to have a meal with them.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.753
Where are you these days?

48:47.491 --> 48:49.789
I quitted the cop two years age.

48:50.127 --> 48:54.791
I run a small business now.

48:55.599 --> 49:00.536
I didn't bring my business card.
How old are you, boy?

49:01.772 --> 49:06.106
- Then, enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

49:14.584 --> 49:15.983
Who's that?

49:42.212 --> 49:46.012
- Life is beautiful.
- What?

49:52.990 --> 49:55.322
Life is beautiful.

49:56.793 --> 49:57.919
Isn't it?

50:00.330 --> 50:01.456
Oh... yes.

50:24.554 --> 50:25.987
What's this?

50:26.089 --> 50:29.456
Peppermint candy from the restaurant.

50:29.593 --> 50:31.060
No, I don't want any.

50:31.261 --> 50:33.889
Take it. It'll freshen your breath.

50:35.065 --> 50:37.431
Darling, your breath smelled bad.

50:37.901 --> 50:39.391
Since when am I your darling?

51:13.937 --> 51:15.529
You want to taste this?

51:21.311 --> 51:23.108
Delicious!

51:23.613 --> 51:26.104
Did you make all this by yourself?

51:26.383 --> 51:29.352
The maid helped a little,
but I did almost all.

51:29.986 --> 51:33.478
Mr. Kim is lucky to have
a wife talented for cooking.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.022
Sorry, it took so long.

51:38.929 --> 51:44.629
Mrs. Kim, quickly have a seat.
Mr. Kim! You, too! Come on.

51:46.203 --> 51:47.500
Go over there.

51:49.439 --> 51:51.339
Fucker!

51:53.777 --> 51:54.869
Go! Go!

51:54.978 --> 51:57.139
Leave the dog alone.

52:01.751 --> 52:06.518
My husband just can't stand dog.

52:09.025 --> 52:12.825
- I hate dogs.
- Why is that?

52:16.666 --> 52:17.860
Because they're dogs.

52:21.304 --> 52:26.241
Don't beat it, just kill it.

52:27.477 --> 52:29.411
Come on.
What are you doing, folks?

52:29.946 --> 52:31.914
- Have the glass filled.
- Yes.

52:35.886 --> 52:38.184
Let's congratulate our hosts
on their new house.

52:38.288 --> 52:40.722
- Let's toast!
- Excuse me.

52:41.358 --> 52:44.020
Can I pray for us
before having a toast?

52:45.328 --> 52:47.694
Why not? Go ahead.

52:53.970 --> 52:58.168
Thank you dear lord.

53:00.010 --> 53:03.946
Today, our family has moved
into a new house.

53:05.215 --> 53:08.616
Thank you for bringing us

53:08.685 --> 53:13.418
together at this precious time.

53:14.457 --> 53:17.085
Bless everyone here to have

53:17.360 --> 53:21.228
a good time sharing
delicious food.

53:22.132 --> 53:26.091
We pray for our peaceful mind.

53:27.704 --> 53:32.266
Please protect their business.

53:33.443 --> 53:37.812
Dear God, our Father.

53:38.882 --> 53:42.511
Please let them be healthy.

53:44.454 --> 53:50.017
Bless these young lambs.

53:51.194 --> 53:54.357
May this family

54:01.972 --> 54:05.032
continue to love

54:05.909 --> 54:07.740
and believe...

54:19.356 --> 54:22.553
each other...

54:29.332 --> 54:31.800
Please protect the man

54:36.439 --> 54:38.236
of the house...

54:47.584 --> 54:49.609
Don't cry, please!

55:00.997 --> 55:02.692
Seamin's daddy!

55:10.173 --> 55:12.004
Be quiet!

55:18.114 --> 55:19.843
Seamin's daddy!

55:26.923 --> 55:29.016
Seamin's daddy!

55:40.870 --> 55:43.031
Seamin's daddy!

56:23.913 --> 56:26.182
Confession

56:26.182 --> 56:30.642
Confession
Spring 1987

56:42.665 --> 56:44.496
Why are you looking at my eating?

56:46.503 --> 56:49.097
Do you know how long it's been
since you last eat at home?

56:51.641 --> 56:57.443
Last night I dreamed a strange dream

56:58.415 --> 56:59.949
where you're missing there.

56:59.949 --> 57:03.146
I woke up calling you
because I can't find you

57:03.386 --> 57:05.820
to find my face wet with tears.

57:28.244 --> 57:29.711
Don't do that, I say.

57:44.928 --> 57:46.919
I think I'd better go to the hospital.

57:53.970 --> 57:58.532
Some days left
but I feel little strange.

58:07.150 --> 58:12.144
I'll call you later.
Please say something!

58:13.556 --> 58:15.080
Don't call!

58:18.127 --> 58:19.788
Don't call!

58:26.870 --> 58:29.939
Students continued
violent demonstration

58:29.939 --> 58:33.136
against the Constitution
after issuing 13th of April

58:33.209 --> 58:35.973
special statement
of President Chun Duwhan.

58:36.179 --> 58:38.272
The police says

58:38.381 --> 58:42.010
it's estimated about
3,700 Students of

58:42.118 --> 58:44.712
20 universities joined
the demonstration today.

58:44.787 --> 58:47.688
Universities which showed force

58:47.757 --> 58:49.918
with throwing
stones and fire bottles were

58:50.059 --> 58:52.994
Yeunsei, Chosun, Jungang

58:53.162 --> 58:56.654
and the students of
Hanyang in Ansan occupied the room

58:56.733 --> 58:58.894
of the president and
set fire to the main building.

58:59.068 --> 59:02.629
Meanwhile, the conference for public peace
was called by No Shinyoung,

59:02.705 --> 59:06.732
the Prime Minister where Jung Hoyoung,
the Home Minister and Suh Dongbum

59:06.809 --> 59:10.370
the president of the Public Prosecutors
office attended to discuss recent...

59:18.154 --> 59:19.985
Hey, Myungsik!

59:24.794 --> 59:28.753
Park Myungsik! Long time no see.

59:29.799 --> 59:31.790
I'm not Park Myungsik.

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.037
Hey!

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.539
Have you thought it over?

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:23.912
I really don't know.

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:27.321
I can't say something
I don't know about.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:30.388
You can't say what you don't know.

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:35.054
But if you think about it carefully,

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:37.497
you can come up with the answer.

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:40.965
Hey!

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:46.973
When I talk, look at me.

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.903
That's an etiquette.

01:00:57.053 --> 01:01:00.250
What's wrong?

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:05.888
Feel bad? I'm asking you!

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:13.661
Asshole, why don't you
answer my question? Why?

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:28.273
If I ask you something

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:31.449
you answer within a second,
got it?

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:34.490
Yes.

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:39.891
That's right.

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:43.490
Does it hurt?

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:52.899
No... yes!

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:56.744
- Does it hurt?
- Yes!

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:00.512
Good!

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:04.819
I want you to answer
everything with honesty.

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:09.417
Don't bother him.
Guess this guy's nickname.

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:27.065
That kid seems easy to scare.

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:30.003
He's tougher than looks.

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:33.377
There's a eat-out tonight?

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:37.083
Right, we are given some money.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.687
A few...

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:44.092
Kim. Your wife called

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:46.996
and said she's about to deliver.

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:51.626
- Hurry home, go to her.
- Time really flies.

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.201
Congratulations! Kim.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.404
You'll soon notice

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:59.263
