WEBVTT

00:34.285 --> 00:39.154
Lieutenant Velorek, this display
of force will change nothing.

00:39.248 --> 00:42.661
This is not a display. I offer
you one final chance
to cooperate.

00:42.752 --> 00:47.166
I have been bonded to this
Leviathan for 21 cycles.

00:47.256 --> 00:50.669
Two minds, two bodies,
intertwined as one.

00:50.760 --> 00:55.254
Whatever your secret project
is, I will not participate!

00:55.348 --> 00:59.466
This Leviathan will do what I
wish if you lead her to do so.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.302
You Peacekeepers subjugate us,

01:02.396 --> 01:06.685
torture us, and now you expect
us to cooperate with you?

01:06.776 --> 01:12.817
You have no understanding
of the covenant between
Leviathan and Pilot.

01:12.907 --> 01:15.068
l tk ar-t Keta.

01:15.159 --> 01:16.365
(gasping)

01:16.452 --> 01:18.488
Another Pilot?

01:18.579 --> 01:21.537
He's being held down at the
Transport Bay, awaiting
your decision.

01:21.624 --> 01:25.116
I insist you reverse the
Control Collar anesthetic

01:25.211 --> 01:28.203
and reawaken this Leviathan
at once!

01:28.297 --> 01:30.709
You insist?

01:30.800 --> 01:33.758
Lieutenant, what is
taking so long?

01:36.472 --> 01:39.054
I'm offering her one last
chance to see the
folly of her...

01:39.141 --> 01:41.132
You have secured a
replacement Pilot?

01:41.227 --> 01:42.182
Yes Captain, but...

01:42.270 --> 01:43.225
Fire!

01:45.439 --> 01:47.350
(moaning)

02:01.455 --> 02:03.662
How long will it take
to replace it?

02:03.749 --> 02:06.331
I can't be certain until
we extract the body.

02:06.419 --> 02:08.250
Then stop wasting my time.

02:08.337 --> 02:10.373
Get your unit working!

02:12.550 --> 02:14.211
Move!

02:22.435 --> 02:24.346
How far down there do
you think it is?

02:24.437 --> 02:26.803
I don't know. We'll find out
soon enough.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.307
I hate waste removal.

02:28.399 --> 02:32.142
Keep your opinions to yourself.
Is that clear?!

02:32.236 --> 02:33.976
All:
Yes, sir!

02:37.450 --> 02:39.065
Crichton:
Where'd you find this?

02:39.160 --> 02:40.445
Chiana:
Top Tier.

02:40.536 --> 02:43.198
Digging through all the
dren stored up there.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.831
It must be some kind of
Peacekeeper recording device.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.419
Did you see what I see?

02:49.503 --> 02:51.789
This is Aeryn. It shows she's
been aboard Moya...

02:51.881 --> 02:53.917
Peacekeepers must have kept
these things running 24/7

02:54.008 --> 02:54.918
to spy on their people.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.749
Crichton, that is Aeryn!

02:56.844 --> 02:59.005
She's been aboard Moya before.

03:00.765 --> 03:03.256
She killed a Pilot.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.524
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:17.615 --> 03:21.028
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.780
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

03:23.871 --> 03:27.204
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.280
Help me.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.582
Listen, please.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.499
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:31.587 --> 03:35.876
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.343
I'm doing everything I can.

03:38.427 --> 03:41.260
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.286
Velorek:
I'm offering her one last chance
to see the folly of her...

04:07.373 --> 04:09.534
You have secured a
replacement Pilot?

04:09.625 --> 04:10.580
Yes, Captain, but...

04:10.668 --> 04:11.532
Fire!

04:11.627 --> 04:13.288
( laser blasts )

04:13.379 --> 04:15.335
(moaning)

04:18.426 --> 04:19.836
How long will it take to
replace it?

04:19.927 --> 04:22.259
I can't be certain until we
extract the body.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.086
Then stop wasting my time!

04:24.181 --> 04:26.012
Get your unit working!

04:27.268 --> 04:29.133
How far down there do you
think it is?

04:29.228 --> 04:30.513
I don't know. We'll find
out soon enough.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.141
Keep your opinions to
yourselves! Is that clear?!

04:33.232 --> 04:34.847
All:
Yes, sir!

04:34.942 --> 04:37.149
Aeryn:
Yes, it's me. I admit it.
Are you happy now?

04:37.236 --> 04:39.397
Zhaan:
This shows you have been
aboard Moya before.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.989
Why didn't you ever tell us?

04:41.073 --> 04:42.483
Rygel:
Criminally obvious, isn't it?

04:42.575 --> 04:45.487
She helped murder a
defenseless Pilot.

04:45.578 --> 04:47.614
Must have been about
three cycles ago.

04:47.705 --> 04:51.072
I've been aboard hundreds of
Leviathans and I had no idea
that it was Moya.

04:51.167 --> 04:53.203
Oh, so all non-Sebacians
look alike? That it?

04:53.294 --> 04:54.784
ldidn't know, Chiana.

04:54.879 --> 04:58.792
Look, the Aeryn on that tape
is not the Aeryn we know.

04:58.883 --> 05:00.373
It was a long time ago.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.208
Three cycles isn't that long.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.635
Heh. I was aboard Moya by then.

05:04.722 --> 05:06.337
As was I.

05:06.432 --> 05:11.051
Maybe you were one of the ones
who took a turn torturing me!

05:11.145 --> 05:13.386
Ever torture a Hynerian?

05:13.481 --> 05:15.221
Perhaps you helped
torture me, too.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.682
No!
-Aeryn, just don't...

05:18.861 --> 05:21.853
Okay, everybody.
Neutral corners.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.562
Let's chill out for a microt.

05:23.657 --> 05:28.196
We all have things in our past
that we'd rather not have on
instant replay.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.152
Zhaan:
True enough, John.

05:30.247 --> 05:34.240
But I still can't accept the
cold-blooded slaughter

05:34.335 --> 05:36.246
of such a helpless creature.

05:36.337 --> 05:39.295
Oh, it's perfectly fine to cut
off one of his arms then,
is it, Zhaan?

05:39.882 --> 05:41.372
Peacekeeper murderer!

05:41.467 --> 05:43.207
Aeryn, no!

05:46.055 --> 05:47.420
Dont

05:48.933 --> 05:51.140
You're not helping your case.

05:52.228 --> 05:54.810
Chiana:
What have you guys been
thinking all this time?

05:54.897 --> 05:57.263
What, she was out picking
baskets of Rawlis buds

05:57.358 --> 06:00.691
while all the other mean
Peacekeepers did all the
really nasty stuff?

06:05.324 --> 06:07.110
She was a Peacekeeper.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.358
Yes.

06:09.453 --> 06:13.287
l was a Peacekeeper, and things
were very different then.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.745
My priorities, my values,

06:17.836 --> 06:19.963
and my relationships.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.821
Officer Sun.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.745
Wish you were back flying
Prowlers again, eh?

06:58.043 --> 07:00.955
You're a very fine pilot.

07:01.046 --> 07:04.254
I'm glad you were reassigned
to fly my transport.

07:05.467 --> 07:09.301
We were in space for
22 solar days,

07:09.388 --> 07:12.846
and not once did you ask
what the cargo was.

07:12.933 --> 07:17.893
| get yanked from Prowler duty
without cause and reassigned
to transport duty.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.641
That's fine.

07:19.732 --> 07:21.313
I do what I'm ordered to do.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.857
But that doesn't mean I have
to be interested.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.185
Healthy curiosity isn't against
regulations, officer.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.941
Asking questions is.

07:28.032 --> 07:31.195
And besides, if I had a question
to ask of my superiors,

07:31.285 --> 07:33.321
it would be "why was I pulled
from Prowler detail

07:33.412 --> 07:35.198
and when do | get to go back?"

07:35.289 --> 07:37.450
(muffled groaning )

07:52.097 --> 07:53.928
The replacement Pilot.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.386
Aeryn, you saw Pilot.

08:00.481 --> 08:03.348
Our Pilot, being
brought onboard?

08:09.114 --> 08:12.732
l was sent on the cargo
transport mission and
that was my cargo.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.410
If I'd known that it was Moya,
that it was our Pilot,

08:16.497 --> 08:18.283
I would have said
something long ago.

08:18.374 --> 08:20.285
I can't tell if you're
lying or not.

08:20.376 --> 08:22.913
One thing I do know.
For all our sakes,

08:23.003 --> 08:26.040
Pilot had better never see
this recording.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.294
Zhaan:
What's done is done. There's
nothing we can do about it now.

08:29.385 --> 08:32.343
If you'll excuse me, I'd rather
spend the next few arns alone.

08:34.848 --> 08:38.215
Chiana:
So, our Pilot wasn't
Moya's first Pilot.

08:38.310 --> 08:42.178
Well, | su... sure didn't know
you could replace them.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.355
You can replace them all right,
but it's a long,

08:45.442 --> 08:49.355
difficult, dangerous procedure.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.823
I think I'll go and
check up on Zhaan.

08:55.244 --> 08:58.657
So, the guy on the tape.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.238
That was his job?

09:01.333 --> 09:04.325
Replace Miss Pilot with
Mr. Pilot?

09:04.420 --> 09:08.880
It was Velorek's job to bond the
new Pilot to the ship, to Moya.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.873
Any way he could.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.089
( chattering fearfully)

09:14.179 --> 09:17.262
Remember what we discussed.
Remember what we discussed!

09:17.349 --> 09:19.055
There's nothing to be afraid of.

09:19.143 --> 09:20.883
I can't understand what
he's saying.

09:20.978 --> 09:24.562
He's speaking in his species'
ancient language.

09:24.648 --> 09:30.143
One sentence can carry over a
hundred different facts,
concepts, emotions.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.900
Far too complex for our
translator microbes
to interpret.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.323
Once he's calmed down, once
he's comfortable here,

09:36.410 --> 09:39.026
then he'll start to simplify
his sentences for us.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.486
Man:
Attention, sir.

09:43.459 --> 09:44.790
( screaming )

09:44.877 --> 09:48.085
You will straighten out and
you will do so immediately!

09:48.172 --> 09:49.161
Is that clear?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.917
(panting)

09:51.008 --> 09:52.794
Captain Crais.

09:55.304 --> 09:58.341
Running into problems already,
Lieutenant?

09:58.432 --> 10:00.718
You're not filling me
with confidence.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.141
No, not a problem, sir.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.970
No. It s happened. It's over.

10:06.064 --> 10:09.352
Like Zhaan said, what's done
is done. I can't undo it.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.401
| just thought perhaps
if you talked.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.648
No means no, John.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.298
Velorek:
I estimate that insertion will
be complete in 83 arns.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.592
You may have 60.
-It can't be done.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.260
Then you will find a way.

10:39.348 --> 10:42.340
Your sole responsibility is to
install this new Pilot

10:42.434 --> 10:45.267
and teach her to command this
Leviathan as l direct her.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.766
This Pilot is a "he," sir.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.939
With all due respect, I
understand my responsibilities.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.937
But this Pilot is young and
inexpenenced.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.770
That's why the Peacekeeper
Military Tech sent me you.

10:55.864 --> 10:59.402
You were the only one who could
do what I want as quickly
as I want.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.155
The success of my project
depends on it.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.282
Are you telling me you can't?

11:04.373 --> 11:08.207
It will take time to acclimate
him, more time to conform
physiology,

11:08.293 --> 11:10.500
and even more time
to teach him.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.919
And that is what my
report will say.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.840
And my report will say they're
merely excuses to mask
your own incompetence.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.384
Whose report do you think
will be believed?

11:19.471 --> 11:21.382
Don't you threaten me,
Lieutenant.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.714
Take a lesson from
your new Pilot.

11:23.809 --> 11:27.267
Anyone can be replaced.
-Captain Crais?

11:27.354 --> 11:32.314
Officer, Aeryn Sun, lcarion
Company, Pleisar Regiment.
Currently reassigned.

11:32.401 --> 11:36.690
I'd like to state my case for
being returned to my regular
assignment as a Prowler...

11:36.780 --> 11:39.863
(door clangs)

11:39.950 --> 11:43.408
I guess we're stuck with each
other for at least a little
while longer.

11:49.626 --> 11:53.790
Well, well, if it isn't our
high and mighty little
Prowler pilot.

11:53.881 --> 11:57.794
Too good to get down in the
hull with us and dig out that
old Pilot's guts, eh?

11:57.885 --> 11:59.750
All those nerve fibers.

11:59.845 --> 12:03.087
I couldn't believe how far down
that beastie got into this ship.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.921
Well, you're one of us now.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.759
You'll be digging guts
with us next time.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.181
(grunting)

12:11.815 --> 12:12.520
Fire!

12:12.608 --> 12:14.644
(Pilot screaming)

12:16.403 --> 12:17.643
(shrieking)

12:28.665 --> 12:31.372
(sobbing)

12:32.794 --> 12:35.410
You're making hamburger there.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.673
Talk to me.

12:41.345 --> 12:42.676
Come on.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.758
What happened back then?

12:45.849 --> 12:47.464
(sobbing)

12:47.559 --> 12:49.140
Come on.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.352
Shh...

13:05.994 --> 13:11.489
Crichton, you might have
noticed that at times, I've
kept you at a distance.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.084
Many times.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.159
Vast distances.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.538
There's a reason for that.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.336
Just one?

13:19.383 --> 13:21.294
Go ahead.

13:22.678 --> 13:27.547
Most Peacekeepers are bred and
reared for one purpose.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.347
Military service.

13:29.434 --> 13:33.177
Procreation is assigned.

13:33.271 --> 13:36.308
There's no such thing as
a lifelong mate.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.186
But you have relationships.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.891
The male and female kind.

13:39.987 --> 13:43.946
Of course. As many and
as often as you want.

13:44.032 --> 13:49.368
Peacekeeper High Command
understands the troops'
biological needs.

13:51.039 --> 13:57.080
Only you don't connect with
anyone openly and never
with any longevity.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.583
I guess, the point is,

14:00.674 --> 14:06.214
my relationships back then
tended to be somewhat...

14:07.305 --> 14:08.465
Empty.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.472
Painful.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.766
What does this have to
do with the tape?

14:16.857 --> 14:18.267
Wha...

14:20.277 --> 14:22.484
Oh, this is about that guy.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.112
Velorek.

14:46.887 --> 14:47.876
What about him?

14:47.971 --> 14:49.302
He, um...

15:01.234 --> 15:02.610
He what?

15:03.445 --> 15:04.400
We...

15:28.720 --> 15:30.301
We were lovers.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.842
Lovers?

15:43.860 --> 15:46.067
Lovers. Um...

15:47.656 --> 15:49.487
interesting.

15:51.451 --> 15:56.411
ldon't think I've ever heard
you use that word before ever.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.954
So, uh, you...

16:07.217 --> 16:09.424
did you love him?

16:09.511 --> 16:13.345
Uh... I felt something for him

16:13.431 --> 16:17.845
that I never felt with any of
the other men | recreated with.

16:19.396 --> 16:22.229
I don't know what it was, but...

16:22.315 --> 16:25.057
I guess now, I'd say that
it was love.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.727
Right.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.609
Well, from the way you tell
the story, he sounded kind
of sadistic.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.236
No...

16:33.618 --> 16:35.449
The opposite.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.278
That was the problem.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.329
Pilot:
Officer Sun.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.250
We must talk.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.840
How the hell did he get
hold of that?

16:50.927 --> 16:53.509
It doesn't matter.
He's seen it.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.303
l have to talk to him.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.220
Fine. I'll go with you.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.343
No.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.558
It has to bejust him and me.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.699
Pilot?

17:23.126 --> 17:24.912
This is difficult for
both of us.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.288
Both of us?

17:26.379 --> 17:30.873
It isn't me on that recording
committing barbaric slaughter,

17:31.426 --> 17:33.382
with no remorse.

17:33.470 --> 17:36.303
This is me, Pilot. Aeryn.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.301
We are closer than any two
others on this ship.

17:39.392 --> 17:43.010
I still carry remnants of your
DNA inside of me.

17:43.104 --> 17:46.437
That's why your betrayal
cuts so deep.

17:46.524 --> 17:52.520
Your DNA is the same DNA as the
Pilot on this recording.

17:52.614 --> 17:56.323
Do you have any idea how
I felt when I saw it?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.946
When I was reminded of
what I had done?

17:59.037 --> 18:00.402
(growling)

19:10.483 --> 19:12.565
Prepare for all power conduits
to connect!

19:12.652 --> 19:14.188
Ready, sir.

19:14.279 --> 19:15.815
Okay.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.442
We're ready to remove
this thing now.

19:18.533 --> 19:22.242
So remember, calm and
easy,okay?

19:22.329 --> 19:24.411
We're ready, sir.
-Okay, here we go.

19:27.042 --> 19:29.829
( pilot speaks in native
language) -Slow, slow, slow.

19:29.919 --> 19:32.752
Remember, simple sentences.

19:32.839 --> 19:33.828
Yes.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.175
Am I there?

19:37.886 --> 19:39.467
Indeed, you are.

19:39.554 --> 19:42.045
Your new home.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.426
The ship.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.132
Her name is Moya.

19:46.227 --> 19:47.478
Moya.

19:47.562 --> 19:49.848
( screaming )

19:49.939 --> 19:51.224
No!

19:51.316 --> 19:52.726
Crichton!

19:52.817 --> 19:53.852
Crichton!

19:53.943 --> 19:55.194
Aeryn?!

19:55.278 --> 19:56.643
Aeryn?!

19:57.947 --> 19:59.027
What happened?

19:59.115 --> 20:00.230
Aeryn went to see Pilot.

20:00.325 --> 20:01.815
He somehow got his hands
on the recording.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.322
I'd have that recording in
my quarters, hidden.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.323
( screaming )

20:06.414 --> 20:09.281
Does she know I'm here?
Does she...

20:09.376 --> 20:11.742
She's under heavy sedation
at the moment.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.122
She will be until the bonding
is complete.

20:14.214 --> 20:18.674
But the bonding takes over
a cycle, sometimes two.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.467
That is natural bonding.
We don't have time for that.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.590
(Pilot screaming)

20:23.681 --> 20:25.091
Crichton:
No!

20:25.183 --> 20:26.263
Pilot!

20:26.351 --> 20:27.966
(screaming continues)

20:29.604 --> 20:31.595
Aeryn (coughing):
John!

20:37.404 --> 20:38.689
He's venting the chamber!

20:38.780 --> 20:40.145
(gagging )

20:45.912 --> 20:48.028
(Pilot screaming)

20:48.123 --> 20:50.910
This ship, this Moya.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.164
She doesn't know her old Pilot
is dead, does she?

20:55.255 --> 21:00.545
When she's awakened, my
presence here will be a
complete surprise to her.

21:00.635 --> 21:04.048
By then, the bonding process
will be complete.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.471
There's no more time to allow
you further adjustments

21:06.558 --> 21:08.423
to your new surroundings.

21:16.568 --> 21:19.275
It's best for all of us the
sooner we get this over with.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.867
(Pilot groaning)

21:29.831 --> 21:31.913
( screaming )

21:35.336 --> 21:37.122
(coughing)

21:37.213 --> 21:40.421
You killed this ship's
first Pilot!

21:40.508 --> 21:43.090
The Pilot that belonged here!

21:43.178 --> 21:47.387
I will not have you aboard
defiling her with your presence.

21:47.474 --> 21:53.185
Until Aeryn leaves this vessel,
Moya will not move
another metra.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.728
(engine shutting down)

22:07.744 --> 22:11.328
(yelling in frustration )
You stole the datacam from
D'Argo's room, didn't ya?

22:11.414 --> 22:13.780
You showed it to Pilot,
didn't ya?

22:13.875 --> 22:15.991
He deserved to see the truth.
-Oh, the truth.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.121
It was my ethical duty.
-Ethical?!

22:18.213 --> 22:21.296
I am a Dominar of principle
as well as action.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.964
Principle? No, no, no. I think
you showed it to him so
he owed you one.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.713
Yeah, a big one.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.259
( screaming )

22:28.097 --> 22:29.348
Well?

22:29.432 --> 22:32.048
Pilot is a creature of his word.
We've not moved one metra.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.223
We're just drifting.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.222
You know, we've never seen
Pilot like this before.

22:35.313 --> 22:38.146
Chop off an arm the best he can
muster is a few snotty remarks.

22:38.233 --> 22:41.396
But this, he shuts down the ship
and he tries to kill Aeryn.

22:41.486 --> 22:43.147
Shut down is right.

22:43.238 --> 22:45.945
We're not moving unless
he wants us to.

22:46.032 --> 22:49.149
Yeah, there's more to it than
what's on that recording.

22:49.244 --> 22:52.327
Kind of makes you wonder how
bad things were back then.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.153
I wouldn't know.

22:54.249 --> 22:59.084
I spent the whole time with my
collarbones chained to the
walls of my cell.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.380
Oh, did I hurt you, my dear?

23:08.471 --> 23:09.506
You're done, Zhaan.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.588
Thank you for your compassion.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.268
Interesting hearing you
speaking of compassion.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.471
You think I lack compassion?

23:19.566 --> 23:23.309
That Pilot is right and that I
defile Moya with my presence?

23:24.654 --> 23:26.269
Well, you know what?

23:26.364 --> 23:28.229
He's right.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.815
And you are right.

23:30.910 --> 23:35.449
And I will be in my Prowler
and out of here in less
than an em.

23:37.709 --> 23:38.619
I'm sorry.

23:38.710 --> 23:39.995
No, Zhaan.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.374
I am what I am and I did
what I did.

23:43.464 --> 23:47.707
Aeryn, you had no choice
back then.

23:47.802 --> 23:51.294
You did exactly what was
expected of you.

23:51.389 --> 23:55.302
In that world, that was the
only kind of Peacekeeper
you could be.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.261
( panting softly)

24:23.421 --> 24:26.254
Did you hear some call to
Battle Stations that I didn't?

24:26.341 --> 24:32.211
No. But we're finished and I
have to get to my duty station.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.342
Well, you're not expected there
for another half arn.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.386
Spend it here with me.

24:45.318 --> 24:49.186
You don't enjoy being
here with me?

24:49.280 --> 24:52.238
Hmm. I enjoy it.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.279
But...

24:55.370 --> 25:02.367
it just isn't right to actually
feel something for a fellow
Peacekeeper, is it?

25:02.460 --> 25:06.123
Well, what's the point? We
won't be assigned to be
together forever.

25:06.756 --> 25:08.462
We could be.

25:08.549 --> 25:13.464
I'm high enough in Military
Tech hierarchy.

25:13.554 --> 25:16.136
I could make it happen.

25:17.058 --> 25:19.174
If you wanted me to.

25:19.268 --> 25:22.635
Peacekeeper High Command makes
all assignment decisions.

25:22.730 --> 25:28.020
High Command doesn't always
make the right decisions.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.610
Come on, Aeryn.

25:31.698 --> 25:38.115
You and I have been intimate
since the second solar day of
our voyage to get here.

25:40.248 --> 25:43.456
There's something about you.

25:43.543 --> 25:48.412
Something special, and
I think you know it.

25:49.340 --> 25:50.250
No.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.423
No, I'm not special.

25:52.510 --> 25:56.469
Don't take the Peacekeeper
hard line, Aeryn.

25:58.182 --> 26:00.719
You understand what I'm saying.

26:02.854 --> 26:07.848
Can you honestly tell me all
you want out of life is
to fly Prowlers,

26:07.942 --> 26:10.479
like a thousand others,

26:10.570 --> 26:14.154
and serve a madman like
Captain Crais?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.322
That is outright
insubordination.

26:16.409 --> 26:17.740
No, it's not.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.658
It's observation.

26:19.746 --> 26:25.332
Think beyond the box the
Peacekeepers put your
mind in, Aeryn.

26:25.418 --> 26:32.039
Crais is a maniac and his
coveted project is an
abomination.

26:32.133 --> 26:36.217
No, I don't know anything about
Crais' project and I don't
want to know.

26:36.304 --> 26:39.967
The project will likely kill
this Leviathan and I cannot
let that happen.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.184
Will not.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.724
What does that mean?

26:47.273 --> 26:51.266
Aeryn, I know how I
feel about you.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.818
And I think I know how you
feel about me.

26:54.906 --> 27:00.276
When I leave here, lwant you
to come with me.

27:02.622 --> 27:05.409
You can be so much more.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.327
Crichton:
Aeryn.

27:08.711 --> 27:10.292
What are you doing?

27:10.379 --> 27:11.960
She's going to do
as Pilot asks.

27:12.048 --> 27:14.289
She's planning to leave Moya.

27:26.354 --> 27:29.096
Crichton:
Pilot, we have to talk.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.431
Let's hash this out right here,
right now.

27:31.526 --> 27:34.313
Five cents, the doctor is in.

27:36.656 --> 27:40.399
Major systems grafts are
complete. Now, are you
ready for this?

27:40.493 --> 27:43.701
I'm... I'm in a great
deal of pain.

27:43.788 --> 27:46.074
You'll get used to the pain.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.280
Get used to it?!

27:47.375 --> 27:49.616
It will go away, won't it?

27:49.710 --> 27:51.996
I'm afraid not.

27:52.088 --> 27:55.797
An unfortunate but permanent
side effect of the
grafting process.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.215
Now, I'm about to reawaken
the Leviathan.

27:58.302 --> 28:03.342
All of her senses will reawaken
instantly along with her
consciousness.

28:03.432 --> 28:06.094
Remember, her senses are
now yours.

28:06.185 --> 28:10.895
Nothing I can say can prepare
you for what you're about
to experience.

28:10.982 --> 28:13.064
Try not to be afraid.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.015
I won't cry out.

28:15.611 --> 28:17.317
You will.

28:18.406 --> 28:20.317
( screaming )

28:26.956 --> 28:28.241
Something is wrong!

28:28.332 --> 28:30.323
Something is horribly wrong!

28:30.418 --> 28:32.909
Moya can sense your presence.

28:33.004 --> 28:35.086
She knows that you're not
her old Pilot.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.456
(yelling )
What is that?!

28:38.551 --> 28:41.668
I'm sorry. It's a pain pulse
from her Control Collar.

28:41.762 --> 28:44.094
I must force her to accept you.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.217
It is unbearable!

28:46.309 --> 28:49.893
It's the only way for her to
accept you as her new Pilot.

28:49.979 --> 28:51.719
(strangled cry)

28:55.026 --> 28:59.235
Moya only accepted me because
she was tortured into it.

28:59.322 --> 29:00.983
Tortured into it!

29:01.073 --> 29:03.325
(strangled cry)

29:11.125 --> 29:14.208
Moya is free of me.

29:14.295 --> 29:16.251
Pilot, what the hell are you...

29:17.173 --> 29:20.586
I'm no longer bonded to her.

29:26.057 --> 29:29.094
I am reading major variances in
the life support system.

29:29.185 --> 29:32.723
The internal gravity bladders
are all deforming and Moya's
trying to fix it herself.

29:32.813 --> 29:35.350
That's because Pilot
is off-line.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.353
Crichton, what the frell is
going on down there?!

29:38.444 --> 29:41.026
Pilot, what the hell
have you done?!

29:41.113 --> 29:43.195
No, no, no, no, no,
this is not good.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.318
No, no, not good!

29:46.786 --> 29:51.325
The pain is finally gone.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.294
And Pilot's been in pain
all this time?

29:59.382 --> 30:02.874
Very likely. I remember Velorek
was forced to graft Pilot to
Moya's systems

30:02.969 --> 30:05.335
instead of letting the process
occur naturally.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.465
And why didn't you tell us
about this before?

30:07.556 --> 30:10.263
Because I didn't know it was
this Pilot, remember?

30:13.479 --> 30:15.845
Kids, save it for after school.

30:15.940 --> 30:19.728
Right now, how do we fix this
thing so we stop bobbing about
like three men in a tub?

30:19.819 --> 30:21.229
We don't.
-We don't.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.696
We need Pilot's help.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.396
He's got to instruct us through
the process manually.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.652
Yeah, well, I don't think
Pilot's in a...

30:27.743 --> 30:30.576
'Leviathan for Dummies'
kind of mood right now.

30:32.957 --> 30:34.913
Pilot:
Yes, working.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.332
Velorek:
Does that feel good?

30:37.253 --> 30:38.538
You sure?

30:38.629 --> 30:39.869
Mm.

30:44.468 --> 30:45.423
There, how's that?

30:45.511 --> 30:46.921
Much better.

30:47.013 --> 30:50.221
The DRDS are responding
to my impulses now.

30:50.307 --> 30:51.968
Hundreds of them.

30:54.687 --> 30:56.223
( hushed ):
Velorek...

30:56.313 --> 30:57.814
I've completed the task
you asked for.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.274
Everything went
according to plan.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.100
The structure's in place.
The shaft has been sealed.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.276
(whispering continues)

31:04.363 --> 31:05.227
Good, good, good.

31:05.322 --> 31:07.529
Great.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.904
Pilot:
What secret project,
Lieutenant Velorek?

31:10.995 --> 31:15.159
Velorek:
I see your heightened senses
are fully functional now.

31:15.249 --> 31:18.787
This project is nothing for you
to concern yourself with.

31:18.878 --> 31:21.915
I've just made certain that it
should never be a threat to you

31:22.006 --> 31:23.837
or the ship ever again.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.387
Whoa.

31:32.475 --> 31:34.682
I have to talk to him.
-Aeryn, no, no, no.

31:34.769 --> 31:37.556
Pilot's Etch-a-Sketch isn't
operating with all its
knobs right now.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.102
I'm afraid seeing you
won't help.

31:39.190 --> 31:41.101
Besides, he's locked himself
inside his chamber

31:41.192 --> 31:43.649
and the DRDs have taken up
defensive positions.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.192
He must've used voice command.

31:45.279 --> 31:47.315
It's all my fault.

31:47.406 --> 31:51.240
I don't buy that, unless more
happened back then.

31:54.789 --> 31:57.451
So what happened back then?

32:02.171 --> 32:03.286
I have to talk to him.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.836
Aeryn!
-Aeryn!

32:07.051 --> 32:09.042
I'll go.
-No, no, no, I'm already
into this.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.216
No, I can talk some sense
into both of them.

32:10.304 --> 32:12.010
D'Argo... look...

32:15.267 --> 32:16.302
See ya.

32:16.393 --> 32:17.803
I can't believe it.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.391
(DRD engines humming)

32:49.260 --> 32:50.591
( both grunting )

32:52.721 --> 32:56.009
The DRDs are definitely in
a defensive posture.

32:58.394 --> 33:01.181
What do you plan on saying to
Pilot that you think is going
to make a difference?

33:01.272 --> 33:03.183
You are right. This is about
the past,

33:03.274 --> 33:05.981
and he's remembering more and
more about those days.

33:06.068 --> 33:08.229
I'm the only one who could
possibly understand,

33:08.320 --> 33:13.940
so I figure if I can get him to
talk about it, it might help.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.366
So you think that talking
will help?

33:16.453 --> 33:17.954
Mm-hmm.

33:18.038 --> 33:20.495
Why don't you talk to me?

33:24.587 --> 33:27.954
Come on, Aeryn, let me know.

33:28.048 --> 33:30.505
What's got you so torn up
about what happened?

33:30.593 --> 33:33.630
Aeryn, what happened with
you and Velorek?

33:35.306 --> 33:38.264
It's just you, me, and the
walls in here.

33:45.900 --> 33:50.018
I have finished my
assignment here.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.355
I'm going to be
reassigned soon.

33:57.411 --> 33:59.993
I want to go with you.

34:04.418 --> 34:06.374
You mean that?

34:13.677 --> 34:17.465
What about flying Prowlers?

34:17.556 --> 34:20.047
I've been through all the
accepted channels of command.

34:20.142 --> 34:24.852
Without something to single me
out, they'll never listen to me.

34:24.939 --> 34:30.525
I will make this as exciting
for you as flying any
Prowler could ever be,

34:30.611 --> 34:32.192
I promise.

34:32.279 --> 34:33.815
Where would we go?

34:33.906 --> 34:36.363
What does it matter?
Somewhere else.

34:36.450 --> 34:39.692
I don't know how to live
somewhere else.

34:39.787 --> 34:44.281
You only say that because this
is all you've ever known.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.583
In the right new place,
you'll thrive.

34:50.172 --> 34:51.878
Change your mind.

34:53.676 --> 34:55.007
What?

34:55.094 --> 34:58.552
Whatever you did with Crais'
plan, put it back.

34:58.639 --> 35:01.221
What are you talking
about, Aeryn?

35:01.308 --> 35:03.594
Aeryn, what is this about?

35:08.315 --> 35:09.771
What have you done?

35:09.858 --> 35:10.938
What is the meaning of this?!

35:11.026 --> 35:12.607
What do you think
it is, Velorek?

35:12.695 --> 35:14.105
You're under arrest.

35:14.196 --> 35:15.185
On what charge?!

35:15.281 --> 35:17.146
Treason, Of course.

35:17.241 --> 35:21.530
We can find no evidence of your
attempt to sabotage my project.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.987
I think we may have caught you
before you were able to
do your damage.

35:25.749 --> 35:27.785
We'll find out soon enough.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.209
I assume you're the informant?

35:31.297 --> 35:34.289
Yes, Captain.
Officer Aeryn Sun.

35:34.383 --> 35:35.839
Just contact Lieutenant Teegue.

35:35.926 --> 35:39.714
She'll see that you're rewarded
with the assignment
you requested.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.341
Prowler detail, sir?

35:41.432 --> 35:43.388
Whatever.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.726
Bring him.

35:47.021 --> 35:50.855
You found that something special
to single yourself out with.

35:50.941 --> 35:53.023
Congratulations, Aeryn.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.442
No ordinary Peacekeeper
would've attempted this.

35:55.529 --> 35:57.770
I told you, you were special.

36:03.746 --> 36:05.236
(Velorek grunting )

36:19.428 --> 36:21.635
I got my duty.

36:24.058 --> 36:26.470
And what happened to Velorek?

36:32.816 --> 36:36.274
But they never got him to talk.

36:36.362 --> 36:40.071
He never told them what he had
done to sabotage Crais' plan.

36:41.450 --> 36:44.283
But I think I know now.

36:44.370 --> 36:48.784
It was Crais' project to
impregnate a Leviathan, Moya.

36:50.250 --> 36:54.243
To breed a Peacekeeper
Leviathan warship.

36:57.341 --> 37:01.459
Velorek installed the shield
to prevent conception.

37:03.472 --> 37:06.885
The shield that D'Argo
accidentally shattered.

37:08.310 --> 37:09.720
It's no use.

37:09.812 --> 37:11.427
There must be some way to
get Moya to help us.

37:11.522 --> 37:12.728
No, there isn't.

37:12.815 --> 37:15.181
All interior life support
is in Pilot's hands.

37:15.275 --> 37:18.142
Not anymore.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.853
Zhaan:
Even if we can communicate
directly with Moya,

37:20.948 --> 37:22.484
there's nothing she can
do on her own.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.825
Chiana:
Just my luck.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.194
Out of all the Leviathans in
the universe,

37:25.285 --> 37:28.027
I end up aboard one with a
second-string Pilot.

37:28.122 --> 37:31.159
And do we know Moya's first
Pilot was any better?

37:38.006 --> 37:39.507
(thudding)

37:42.469 --> 37:44.255
(speaking foreign language)

37:45.722 --> 37:47.383
Pilot, no!

37:48.267 --> 37:49.848
(more commands)

38:02.281 --> 38:04.613
Get out of my chamber.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.361
Leave me alone!

38:06.452 --> 38:08.363
No, Pilot, we need to talk.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.285
( growls )

38:10.372 --> 38:11.657
Talk?

38:11.748 --> 38:16.082
You want a chance to tell me
how non-violent you are now.

38:16.170 --> 38:21.164
Or what? You'll blast me into
pieces like you did the Pilot
who used to sit here?

38:21.258 --> 38:22.873
Stay away from me!

38:22.968 --> 38:25.550
Tell me now, Pilot.
Talk to me right now
or I swear, I...

38:25.637 --> 38:26.922
Aeryn.

38:28.348 --> 38:30.304
( growls )

38:30.392 --> 38:31.802
Pilot, we're just here to help.

38:31.894 --> 38:34.510
If you stay disconnected from
Moya, you'll starve to death.

38:34.605 --> 38:36.812
And with no one to
regulate them,

38:36.899 --> 38:41.859
your precious life support
systems won't function
properly.

38:41.945 --> 38:45.153
Right, fine, yes. We all want
you back in the seat.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.652
And Moya must be pretty
worried, wondering where the
hell you got to.

38:47.743 --> 38:48.949
Doesn't matter.

38:49.036 --> 38:51.448
She'll be better off
without me.

39:02.799 --> 39:08.339
That recording brought back
memories of a time none of us
wanted to remember.

39:08.430 --> 39:11.342
Based on my actions back then,
I deserve to die.

39:11.433 --> 39:15.893
And if you wish to kill me right
now I'm not going to stop you.

39:17.356 --> 39:20.473
But please, spare the others
and yourself.

39:21.944 --> 39:27.405
Aeryn Sun, it is not you
who deserves death.

39:27.491 --> 39:29.072
It is |.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.327
Okay.

39:31.411 --> 39:35.120
So you're not Moya's original
Pilot. You replaced her.

39:35.207 --> 39:38.244
You can't blame yourself
for that.

39:38.335 --> 39:42.248
I didn't only replace
the old Pilot.

39:44.967 --> 39:48.255
The elders have already
judged me.

39:48.345 --> 39:52.213
They said I was not yet worthy
to Pilot a Leviathan.

39:52.307 --> 39:55.424
If you believed that, you
wouldn't be here right now.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.722
So why are you?

39:57.813 --> 40:01.351
I want to be joined so badly...

40:01.441 --> 40:03.181
I can make that happen,
young one.

40:03.277 --> 40:04.437
But the elders.

40:04.528 --> 40:07.611
The elders have not yet decreed
it to be my destiny.

40:07.698 --> 40:10.940
I offer you the chance to
make your destiny.

40:11.994 --> 40:13.325
Look up.

40:15.289 --> 40:17.325
And what do you see?

40:18.584 --> 40:20.245
Stars.

40:20.335 --> 40:23.418
That's what I offer you.
The stars.

40:23.505 --> 40:26.372
I dream of nothing else.

40:26.466 --> 40:28.331
I offer you a Leviathan.

40:28.427 --> 40:31.339
All you have to do is
agree to help me.

40:31.430 --> 40:37.050
But you said that for me
to be joined, the old one
would have to die.

40:37.144 --> 40:40.386
That Pilot will die no matter
what you do.

40:42.065 --> 40:46.479
If you don't come with me, I'll
find someone else who will.

40:46.570 --> 40:50.404
Someone who isn't afraid to take
their place amongst the stars.

40:53.744 --> 41:00.832
The fate of Moya's true Pilot
was sealed at that moment.

41:00.917 --> 41:07.083
So you see, Aeryn, it wasn't
really you who caused her death.

41:08.383 --> 41:12.251
It was me.

41:12.346 --> 41:19.218
If I hadn't agreed to come,
Velorek may never have found a
replacement Pilot.

41:19.311 --> 41:25.272
But... but I just wanted so
desperately to see the stars.

41:35.369 --> 41:38.577
Do you remember when you
first came aboard Moya?

41:42.250 --> 41:47.461
Velorek stroked your cheek
like this to calm you.

41:47.547 --> 41:51.711
Back then, I couldn't fathom
why he'd do a thing like that.

41:51.802 --> 41:55.386
And now I couldn't fathom
not doing it.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.260
We've come a long way
since then, Pilot.

41:59.351 --> 42:02.434
And we've still got a
long way to go.

42:06.066 --> 42:09.524
Take the journey with me.

42:27.546 --> 42:32.415
I know a procedure, some
temporary connections
that can be made

42:32.509 --> 42:37.048
to give me back rudimentary
control of Moya's systems.

42:39.182 --> 42:41.264
( chuckles )

42:42.060 --> 42:45.223
Okay. Let's get started.

42:55.282 --> 42:59.195
Pilot:
Those temporary connections
you've made are working just fine.

42:59.286 --> 43:03.074
You realize if you finish what
you're doing now,

43:03.165 --> 43:05.872
allowing me to bond with
Moya naturally,

43:05.959 --> 43:09.918
it could take an entire cycle
before the process is complete.

43:10.005 --> 43:13.372
During the bonding period,
I won't have as much control

43:13.467 --> 43:15.708
of Moya's systems as
I had before.

43:15.802 --> 43:19.340
It will make it even more
tenuous for all of us.

43:19.431 --> 43:21.262
D'Argo:
It doesn't matter, Pilot.

43:21.349 --> 43:24.386
You deserve to be bonded
to Moya naturally.

43:25.437 --> 43:28.600
I will work hard to deserve it.

43:29.775 --> 43:31.356
I'm finished.

43:31.443 --> 43:33.274
How does it feel?

43:35.030 --> 43:37.817
There's no pain.

43:37.908 --> 43:40.399
No longer any pain.

43:44.664 --> 43:47.872
Crichton:
Velorek said that he'd
always remember you.

43:49.461 --> 43:51.247
And you, have you...?

43:51.838 --> 43:53.248
Mmm.

43:55.425 --> 43:59.293
He said that in the right new
place, I would thrive.

44:00.889 --> 44:02.425
He was right.

44:10.857 --> 44:14.600
You know, that time when he
asked me to go with him,

44:14.694 --> 44:18.562
he said, you can be
so much more.

44:21.493 --> 44:25.907
That was exactly what you said
to me on the first day
I was here.

44:26.706 --> 44:31.996
And you... say you think...

44:32.087 --> 44:34.499
you loved this man?
