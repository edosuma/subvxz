<i>* In this world *</i>

00:05.300 --> 00:06.500
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

00:06.580 --> 00:10.300
<i>* You know I love</i>

00:10.380 --> 00:12.620
<i>* We'll make this right *</i>

00:12.700 --> 00:17.060

00:17.140 --> 00:18.620

00:18.700 --> 00:20.500

00:20.580 --> 00:21.900

00:34.100 --> 00:37.780

00:37.860 --> 00:38.980

00:44.900 --> 00:48.460
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>

00:58.580 --> 00:59.980
See you later.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.580
Whoa, wait a minute!

01:01.660 --> 01:03.700
What about breakfast?
-What do you call this?

01:03.780 --> 01:06.140
You'll need more than that to get
you through a whole day of teaching.

01:06.220 --> 01:08.460
They're feisty little mermaids,
but I can handle them.

01:08.540 --> 01:11.140
Right, Mimmi?
-If you say so.

01:11.220 --> 01:13.580
Maybe you should have one
more prawn, just in case.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.700
Why don't you come
and watch me teach?

01:16.780 --> 01:18.260
You might even learn something.

01:22.260 --> 01:23.540
What are we doing today?

01:23.620 --> 01:24.820
Can we race to the reef?

01:24.900 --> 01:27.540
I want to get legs,
and go on land.

01:27.620 --> 01:31.540
Walking is only allowed under
very special circumstances.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.620
But there's a dragon now.

01:33.700 --> 01:37.020
If we learned to walk...
we'd be able to escape it.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.780
She does have a point.

01:39.860 --> 01:42.060
See? Please, Ondina.

01:42.140 --> 01:44.140
It's all very well to escape
the water dragon,

01:44.220 --> 01:45.980
but there are dangers on land,
too.

01:46.060 --> 01:47.660
Such as?

01:47.740 --> 01:49.860
Such as land people.

01:49.940 --> 01:53.540
Such as getting wet and exposing
our secret to the world.

01:53.620 --> 01:56.860
All the more reason to teach them
how to walk, so they fit in better.

01:56.940 --> 01:58.860
I'm really good at fitting in.

01:58.940 --> 01:59.980
Me, too.

02:00.060 --> 02:01.380
Please, can we go on land?

02:01.460 --> 02:02.780
Please! Please!

02:05.060 --> 02:06.100
Fine!

02:06.180 --> 02:08.020
Awesome!
-Yes!

02:08.100 --> 02:10.900
And since Weilan
is so keen on it...

02:10.979 --> 02:13.420
I'm sure she won't
mind giving us a hand.

02:15.820 --> 02:17.180
I'm happy to help.

02:28.820 --> 02:31.780
Does a Surf Burger really need this
much cheese, this much lettuce?

02:31.860 --> 02:33.540
That's how they've
always been made.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.140
The meat patty is so thick.

02:35.220 --> 02:37.820
They're handmade,
juicy and really popular.

02:38.540 --> 02:41.940
There's always room for efficiency,
and efficiency means profit.

02:42.900 --> 02:45.860
She's teaching
the little mermaids to walk?

02:45.940 --> 02:47.340
Wish I could see that.

02:47.420 --> 02:49.780
We're taking them to the beach
by the Western Lagoon on Mako.

02:50.740 --> 02:51.980
You should come.

02:52.060 --> 02:53.220
We'll need all the
help we can get.

02:53.980 --> 02:55.980
Sorry. I've got to work.

02:56.820 --> 02:57.860
Here you go.

02:57.940 --> 03:00.300
They should look
very sweet in these.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.220
And how will you be paying?

03:03.980 --> 03:05.180
Ondina will fix you up.

03:18.340 --> 03:19.580
Ugh!

03:19.660 --> 03:22.300
We're doing it!

03:22.380 --> 03:23.420
We're standing up!

03:23.500 --> 03:26.020
Good.
Now keep your legs straight.

03:26.100 --> 03:29.700
And balance on both feet evenly.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.220
Good. Now, to walk...

03:36.300 --> 03:39.020
put one foot in
front of the other...

03:39.100 --> 03:40.860
like so...

03:41.620 --> 03:43.420
Now, let's all give it a try.

03:44.420 --> 03:45.980
They might need a minute.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.260
They'll be fine. Come on.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.180
Mimmi!

04:01.260 --> 04:03.540
Hey.
-Hey.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.260
I thought you didn't
start until 9:00.

04:05.340 --> 04:07.140
Yeah, I...
I like to come here early.

04:07.220 --> 04:08.740
Any particular reason?

04:08.820 --> 04:09.900
There might be.

04:11.700 --> 04:15.020
So, um...
are you doing anything later?

04:15.700 --> 04:17.019
Mmm, nothing's planned.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.940
Any suggestions?

04:19.019 --> 04:20.700
Hey, Chris.

04:20.779 --> 04:22.860
Thought I might find you here.

04:22.940 --> 04:24.860
Feel like a boat ride?

04:24.940 --> 04:26.180
Dr. Ross wants us to go

04:26.260 --> 04:28.900
and check out some of the tagged
turtles they released a while back.

04:28.980 --> 04:30.900
Great. Where?

04:30.980 --> 04:32.420
The Western Lagoon at Mako.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.540
I was out at Mako
not too long ago.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.460
I saw quite a few turtles
in the Northern Lagoon.

04:39.140 --> 04:41.420
Uh, you guys should check there.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.420
Must be different turtles.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.020
GPS puts our turtles
at Western Lagoon.

04:46.980 --> 04:49.340
Mimmi, did you want to...
come with us?

04:49.420 --> 04:50.700
Sure.

04:50.780 --> 04:52.340
My shift finishes at midday.

04:52.420 --> 04:54.660
Sorry, Dr. Ross wants it done
this morning.

04:54.740 --> 04:55.900
Let's go.

04:58.660 --> 04:59.740
Well, maybe next time.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.620
I'll see you later.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.100
Well done, Amaris.

05:16.180 --> 05:18.300
Look up, not down.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.220
Okay...

05:29.300 --> 05:30.660
Lift your legs. Don't be scared.

05:35.140 --> 05:37.460
Don't worry.
You'll get the hang of it soon.

05:41.660 --> 05:42.780
Where's Amaris?

05:45.020 --> 05:47.340
Did you see where she went?

05:47.420 --> 05:48.660
You're the one in charge.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.780
You're supposed to be keeping
an eye on her.

05:51.420 --> 05:52.940
She went that way.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.100
I'd better go find her.

05:54.180 --> 05:56.380
Can you look after
the other three?

05:56.460 --> 05:57.580
I think I can manage that.

06:01.380 --> 06:02.940
You're doing really well.

06:03.020 --> 06:07.460
Just... keep... walking.

06:23.820 --> 06:25.980
This is the "Cam Burger."

06:26.580 --> 06:28.100
A thinner,
flavor-packed patty...

06:28.180 --> 06:29.780
my family's own secret recipe,

06:29.860 --> 06:32.620
on a slightly toasted bun
with just a hint of fresh salad.

06:32.700 --> 06:33.780
It looks cheap.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.500
Cheaper to make, yes, but we'll
still charge the same price.

06:36.580 --> 06:39.140
The Surf Burger
is our top seller.

06:39.220 --> 06:42.380
And, frankly, the name
"Cam Burger" is pretty lame.

06:43.220 --> 06:45.540
Have a little faith, will you?
I'm onto a winner here.

06:45.620 --> 06:49.140
This will maximize profit
by 30% per burger.

06:49.220 --> 06:50.500
Can't you see what
I'm trying to do here?

06:50.580 --> 06:53.660
All I can see is you trying to change
the most popular item on our menu.

06:53.740 --> 06:54.740
Trying to change
it for the better!

06:54.820 --> 06:56.860
There's nothing wrong
with what we've got!

06:56.940 --> 06:59.220
Boys! There is a civilized way
to settle this.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.380
Let a customer decide.

07:00.460 --> 07:03.020
Someone who eats here,
who knows the menu...

07:03.100 --> 07:04.540
whose opinion we trust.

07:05.580 --> 07:06.780
Hey, guys.

07:14.540 --> 07:15.700
What?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.420
Amaris.

07:24.780 --> 07:26.620
Amaris!

07:26.700 --> 07:28.260
Amaris, where are you?

07:32.260 --> 07:35.100
Amaris, the entire class
is waiting for you.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.460
Can you hear me?

07:41.380 --> 07:42.700
Amaris.

07:46.180 --> 07:47.460
Hello?

07:50.220 --> 07:51.700
Come on, Amaris.

07:54.900 --> 07:59.060
Being the burger connoisseur that you are,
we would like you to be our taste-tester.

08:00.460 --> 08:02.700
You mean guinea pig.
-No.

08:02.780 --> 08:05.620
Just give us your completely
unbiased opinion...

08:05.700 --> 08:10.060
about the proposed new burger
compared with the original.

08:10.140 --> 08:13.580
Which, loosely translated,
means... free food.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.660
In that case, I'm in.

08:15.740 --> 08:17.580
Excellent.
I'll go source my ingredients.

08:17.660 --> 08:19.580
We'll have the burgers
ready around noon?

08:19.660 --> 08:20.780
Can't wait.

08:26.700 --> 08:30.460
Of course, if you need something
to sweeten the deal, that's cool.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.260
Sweeten the what?

08:32.340 --> 08:33.580
Well...

08:34.500 --> 08:37.020
Hypothetically, if you were
to choose the Cam Burger,

08:37.100 --> 08:40.340
then I would, hypothetically...

08:40.419 --> 08:42.860
give you a discount
on all future burger purchases.

08:42.940 --> 08:46.140
Are you "hypothetically"
offering me a bribe?

08:46.220 --> 08:48.460
Don't be ridiculous!

08:48.540 --> 08:51.060
You should know I'm not the
kind of person to offer bribes.

08:51.140 --> 08:53.140
I'm merely offering...

08:53.220 --> 08:55.820
a financial advantage
for a certain outcome.

08:58.980 --> 09:01.300
Okay, everyone, take it easy.

09:01.380 --> 09:03.340
Save some energy
for when Ondina gets back.

09:03.420 --> 09:06.140
Weilan!
-Hey, I thought you were working?

09:06.220 --> 09:07.300
Where's Ondina?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.620
Amaris took off.
Ondina's gone to find her.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.620
We've got to get them off
the beach. We've got company.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.140
Girls!

09:17.220 --> 09:19.860
Girls, get back to the pod
as fast as you can.

09:19.940 --> 09:21.540
Go! Go!

09:25.860 --> 09:27.780
We better find
Amaris and Ondina.

09:29.420 --> 09:30.660
Amaris.

09:32.340 --> 09:33.540
Amaris!

09:35.020 --> 09:37.820
You better come back here right
this minute, do you hear me?

09:39.180 --> 09:40.260
Amaris?

09:44.620 --> 09:45.860
What are you doing here?

09:45.940 --> 09:47.820
Where are the others?
Don't tell me they ran off, too.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.860
I sent them back to the pod.
-Why?

09:49.940 --> 09:51.580
Chris and Karl are heading here.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.340
This is the spot.

10:08.420 --> 10:10.620
The colony should be about
100 meters offshore.

10:10.700 --> 10:11.860
We can dive in off the beach.

10:47.540 --> 10:48.540
Hi!

10:51.620 --> 10:52.980
Hey, come back!

11:07.700 --> 11:09.060
Amaris!

11:11.860 --> 11:13.300
She can't have gone too far.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.740
She only just got her legs.

11:14.820 --> 11:17.420
How am I going to tell Veridia
that I've lost a student...

11:17.500 --> 11:18.660
on land?

11:18.740 --> 11:19.900
Let's go back to the beach.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.140
She might have found
her way back there.

11:29.740 --> 11:32.020
It's strange to see
a kid here on their own.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.300
Probably camping
with her family.

11:35.380 --> 11:36.940
A lot of people camp out here.

11:37.020 --> 11:38.420
She looked scared, though.

11:39.020 --> 11:40.460
It's because you're one
scary-looking dude.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.060
Maybe I should go and see
if she's all right.

11:44.540 --> 11:46.380
What about the turtles?

11:46.460 --> 11:48.220
Don't worry. I won't be long.

12:07.620 --> 12:09.100
She's not here. Where is she?

12:10.060 --> 12:11.380
What if she's hurt herself?

12:11.460 --> 12:13.140
We'd better keep looking.

12:13.220 --> 12:14.300
Mimmi?

12:15.980 --> 12:17.500
What are you doing here?

12:20.820 --> 12:23.900
...and I got so caught up at
work that I completely forgot

12:23.980 --> 12:26.180
that I'd promised to
bring Amaris out to Mako.

12:26.260 --> 12:27.420
Who's... who's Amaris?

12:27.500 --> 12:28.660
She's my cousin.
-She's my niece.

12:31.980 --> 12:35.580
So, which one is she,
your cousin or your niece?

12:35.660 --> 12:37.180
Mimmi calls everyone her cousin.

12:38.260 --> 12:40.860
So, anyway, we moored the boat
on the other side of Mako,

12:40.940 --> 12:44.100
and as we were walking through
the jungle, she wandered off.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.980
Have you seen her?
She's about...

12:46.900 --> 12:49.940
so high. Blonde hair...
shorts and a T-shirt?

12:50.020 --> 12:51.740
Actually, yeah,
we have seen her.

12:51.820 --> 12:53.060
But when she saw us,
she ran off.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.980
We'd better go and find her.

12:55.060 --> 12:56.180
We could help.
- Oh, no--

12:56.260 --> 12:58.300
Ah, that's okay.

12:58.380 --> 13:01.220
You need to take care of the
turtles. I'm sure she won't be far.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.660
No, no, no, the more people
searching, the faster we'll find her.

13:03.740 --> 13:06.820
We need to split up into teams.
That way we can cover more ground.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.100
Let's go.

13:30.780 --> 13:32.020
Amaris!

13:32.700 --> 13:34.220
You know, this isn't exactly
what I had in mind

13:34.300 --> 13:36.700
when I asked what
you were doing later.

13:37.660 --> 13:40.180
Hey, uh... how did you get out
of your work shift?

13:40.260 --> 13:43.140
I forgot,
I'd asked for time off.

13:43.220 --> 13:46.380
Amaris has been looking forward
to visiting Mako for so long.

13:46.460 --> 13:47.860
Well, how come you're
still in uniform?

13:47.940 --> 13:49.500
It was all a bit of a rush.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.660
I didn't have time to
go home and change.

13:54.180 --> 13:56.580
Let's go this way.
The track's easier to follow.

13:57.780 --> 14:00.820
So... where did you guys
moor the boat?

14:00.900 --> 14:03.940
We told you.
On the other side of the island.

14:04.020 --> 14:06.860
It's rocky around there.
And steep.

14:06.940 --> 14:08.580
Why didn't you just
moor it in the lagoon?

14:08.660 --> 14:10.020
Would have been much easier
to get to shore.

14:12.220 --> 14:14.540
You ask a lot of questions.

14:15.620 --> 14:16.900
Amaris!

14:18.820 --> 14:20.060
Please answer me.

14:21.340 --> 14:23.380
I won't be angry with you,
I promise.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.540
I really need to
know you're okay.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.580
What do you like to do
with your free time?

15:58.460 --> 15:59.780
The usual stuff.

16:00.540 --> 16:04.780
So you like shopping,
movies, the beach?

16:05.700 --> 16:06.700
All of the above.

16:07.620 --> 16:09.500
Sounds like we've got
a lot in common.

16:11.460 --> 16:12.820
I don't think so.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.020
Maybe we should hang out
and see if I'm right.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.700
Are you seriously asking me out?

16:20.780 --> 16:22.540
Would it be okay if I was?

16:26.860 --> 16:28.380
So that's a maybe?

16:28.460 --> 16:29.820
Amaris.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.300
Amaris.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.940
Uh, maybe she's gone
back to your boat.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.140
We should check.

16:37.220 --> 16:39.060
No,
Ondina already checked there.

16:39.140 --> 16:40.420
I just hope she's all right.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.500
Don't worry, Mimmi.
We'll find her.

16:44.060 --> 16:45.180
This way.

16:45.260 --> 16:46.420
That way's a dead end.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.300
Oh. Do you come here a lot?

16:48.380 --> 16:49.380
No. Why?

16:49.460 --> 16:51.820
You just seem to
know the place pretty well.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.300
Amaris!

16:55.380 --> 16:56.660
Amaris, come back!

17:02.820 --> 17:03.940
Amaris, wait!

17:04.020 --> 17:05.740
I won't hurt you!

17:06.859 --> 17:08.099
Amaris!

17:21.020 --> 17:22.339
Over here!

17:24.660 --> 17:26.099
She went down here!

17:32.860 --> 17:34.700
Watch out, it's slippery.

17:44.460 --> 17:46.540
She must have swum out.

17:46.620 --> 17:48.500
Why was she so scared of me?

17:58.780 --> 18:00.620
Okay. You ready?

18:01.420 --> 18:02.580
Ready.

18:21.860 --> 18:23.180
May the best burger win.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.540
Amaris!

19:05.500 --> 19:07.940
That was fun.
We should do it again.

19:08.860 --> 19:11.860
How do I put this
simply and clearly?

19:11.940 --> 19:13.660
Never in a million years.

19:13.740 --> 19:15.220
You've got
a great sense of humor.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.740
We should catch up soon.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.860
Amaris swam out to the reef.
-What?

19:19.940 --> 19:21.820
Yeah, we need to take the boat
and get her.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.460
Hey! Look who I found.

19:26.180 --> 19:28.140
Do you have something
you want to say?

19:29.020 --> 19:31.740
I'm so sorry for causing you
so much trouble.

19:31.820 --> 19:34.540
I didn't mean to worry anybody.

19:35.220 --> 19:38.660
I shouldn't have run off.
It was... a dumb thing to do.

19:38.740 --> 19:41.660
And I'll never,
ever do it again.

19:42.540 --> 19:44.740
Well, it looks like
everything is fine.

19:44.820 --> 19:47.340
Yeah, but how come you're dry?

19:48.660 --> 19:50.180
Mate...

19:50.260 --> 19:52.020
She's safe. It's getting late.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.780
We should get back. We can
tag the turtles another time.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.140
Uh, yeah.
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.940
If you ever do anything
like that again...

20:13.540 --> 20:15.540
you'll be cleaning
the reef for a month.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.220
Well?
- Mmm...

20:34.780 --> 20:37.100
Burger one is satisfying.

20:37.180 --> 20:39.820
It's tasty and subtle,
without being overwhelming...

20:41.100 --> 20:43.260
and the balance of
flavors is pretty good.

20:45.420 --> 20:46.900
But it doesn't compete
with burger two,

20:46.980 --> 20:49.900
which I have to say is nothing
short of a taste sensation.

20:50.820 --> 20:52.140
Burger two wins.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.420
I'm sorry, Cam. His is better.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.540
I only wanted to change the
burger so we could turn a profit.

21:09.620 --> 21:12.500
By switching from great-tasting,
homemade hamburgers

21:12.580 --> 21:16.540
to cheap, frozen, tasteless meat
patties bought from a supermarket?

21:17.900 --> 21:20.900
Okay, maybe I got a little bit
carried away with the cost cutting.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.380
You think?

21:26.700 --> 21:30.500
Just because one idea didn't succeed
doesn't mean another one won't.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.700
Business is all about ideas,
and you have plenty of those.

21:37.180 --> 21:39.660
Did I tell you about
my hotdog taco idea?

21:44.180 --> 21:45.700
Am I glad today is over.

21:45.780 --> 21:47.340
I am exhausted.

21:47.420 --> 21:50.340
Poor little Amaris
certainly had an adventure.

21:50.420 --> 21:53.260
I don't think she'll be causing
any more trouble.

21:54.060 --> 21:55.980
I wouldn't be so hard on her.

21:56.060 --> 21:57.740
I know a certain mermaid
who got carried away

21:57.820 --> 21:59.580
riding a water current
when she was a hatchling.

21:59.660 --> 22:02.780
As I remember, the pod was
looking for her for days.

22:02.860 --> 22:04.860
I have no idea who you mean.

22:05.860 --> 22:08.300
I wonder what Veridia
will have to say about it.

22:08.380 --> 22:10.420
I don't think we need
to trouble Veridia.

22:11.020 --> 22:13.260
She did give you the job.
-True, but...

22:13.340 --> 22:16.620
the mermaid council has far more
important things to worry about.

22:16.700 --> 22:17.780
Don't you agree?

22:19.340 --> 22:23.460
Well, I think that that would depend.
-On what?

22:23.540 --> 22:27.020
On how interested a certain
mermaid might be in...

22:28.060 --> 22:29.420
keeping her friends happy.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.740
What do you want?

22:33.420 --> 22:36.540
I was thinking
lobster dinners for a week.

22:36.620 --> 22:39.660
I was thinking two weeks.

22:39.740 --> 22:42.500
Let's split the difference.
Three!

22:42.580 --> 22:43.740
Good idea.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.740
Guys, that's not fair!

22:49.140 --> 22:50.820
<i>* In this world *</i>

22:50.900 --> 22:52.260
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

22:52.340 --> 22:55.660
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

22:55.740 --> 22:57.740
<i>* We'll make this right *</i>

22:57.820 --> 23:02.740
<i>* Find our way</i>
<i>Through this mystery *</i>

23:02.820 --> 23:04.340
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:04.420 --> 23:05.700
<i>* Swimming in the sea *</i>

23:05.780 --> 23:07.140

23:07.220 --> 23:09.340
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:09.420 --> 23:10.940

23:11.020 --> 23:12.580
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:12.660 --> 23:14.060
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

23:14.140 --> 23:16.500
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:16.580 --> 23:18.180
<i>* Ooh ooh *</i>

23:18.260 --> 23:20.900
<i>* Ooh ooh ooh *</i>

23:20.980 --> 23:22.580
<i>* Ooh *</i>

23:22.660 --> 23:24.740
<i>* Ooh ooh *</i>

23:24.820 --> 23:27.500
<i>* Ooh ooh ooh *</i>

23:27.580 --> 23:28.980

23:29.060 --> 23:30.820

23:32.380 --> 23:33.940

23:34.020 --> 23:36.060
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:36.140 --> 23:37.420
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:37.500 --> 23:39.100
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:39.180 --> 23:40.700
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

23:40.780 --> 23:42.900
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:42.980 --> 23:44.500
<i>* Together *</i>

23:44.580 --> 23:46.220
<i>* Forever *</i>

23:46.300 --> 23:49.420

in the sun *</i>

23:49.500 --> 23:51.300
<i>* Together *</i>

23:51.380 --> 23:52.620

23:52.700 --> 23:53.900

23:53.980 --> 23:57.220

23:58.940 --> 24:01.820
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>
