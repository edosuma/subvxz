00:00.885 --> 00:02.381
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.382 --> 00:04.784
This town was my home.
I want it back.

00:04.785 --> 00:07.025
All of your scheming,
the enemies that you have made

00:07.026 --> 00:09.243
every single day
of your miserable life,

00:09.244 --> 00:11.528
what results did you expect,

00:11.529 --> 00:14.032
that your child would be born
into a happy life?

00:14.033 --> 00:16.426
This was our family's hope.

00:16.427 --> 00:18.120
We need to regain
control of the city.

00:18.121 --> 00:20.138
You want allies, right?

00:20.139 --> 00:23.007
This is ground zero
for a new vampire community.

00:23.008 --> 00:24.629
You may think that
you're better than us.

00:24.630 --> 00:25.897
We're all you got.

00:26.703 --> 00:29.280
We made a deal.
He'll pledge his loyalty to Cassie,

00:29.281 --> 00:31.582
report back, and tell me
everything that he learns.

00:31.583 --> 00:33.036
Her name is Gia.

00:33.037 --> 00:34.449
She's the first one
that I turned.

00:34.450 --> 00:36.321
She's gonna need a mentor.

00:36.322 --> 00:38.200
We should've known our
mother would not be bound

00:38.201 --> 00:41.827
- by anything as obvious as death.
- Where is she?

00:41.828 --> 00:46.496
Finn, Kol, we have
a family reunion to plan.

01:43.544 --> 01:46.023
So...
Which restaurant

01:46.024 --> 01:47.791
is missing a compelled chef?

01:47.792 --> 01:49.861
It was certainly a card
I played in the past,

01:49.862 --> 01:51.762
but I had no hand in this.

01:51.763 --> 01:54.282
Oh. Well, then I guess
we have Elijah to thank.

01:54.283 --> 01:56.493
This wasn't my doing.

01:56.494 --> 01:59.836
Then where did this
all come from?

01:59.837 --> 02:01.456
Oh!

02:12.657 --> 02:14.548
What the hell was that?

02:24.127 --> 02:26.268
An invitation from our mother.

02:32.503 --> 02:33.837
Ha ha ha!

02:33.838 --> 02:35.772
Now, children,
it's very hot.

02:35.773 --> 02:38.508
Rebekah, Kol, be careful.

02:38.509 --> 02:40.740
Where's Niklaus?

02:44.981 --> 02:50.687
Elijah, Finn,
where's your brother?

02:50.688 --> 02:55.046
He's in the woods,
mother, hiding.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.769
What are you doing here?

03:06.770 --> 03:10.275
Father said he's
to take me hunting later,

03:10.276 --> 03:15.530
but I'm no good, not with him.

03:15.531 --> 03:18.403
He gets angry at me.

03:21.309 --> 03:23.663
I understand.

03:23.664 --> 03:27.557
Do you know what I
do when I'm afraid?

03:27.558 --> 03:30.460
I listen to the starlings.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.377
When I was a little girl,

03:32.378 --> 03:35.298
my mother taught
one of them a tune,

03:35.866 --> 03:38.633
and since they mimic
each other's songs,

03:38.634 --> 03:45.675
it spread until every starling
in the forest sung it.

03:45.676 --> 03:48.577
When we made this our home,

03:48.578 --> 03:52.682
I brought those same
birds to these woods.

03:52.683 --> 03:54.986
Whenever you hear
one sing, Niklaus,

03:54.987 --> 03:56.441
remember, I'm with you...

04:00.473 --> 04:03.620
Always and forever.

04:12.067 --> 04:14.236
It is times like
this I'm really glad

04:14.237 --> 04:16.071
that I never knew my mother.

04:16.072 --> 04:19.507
We have enough enemies here,
and now the war for our home

04:19.509 --> 04:21.410
is to be fought
against my own family.

04:21.411 --> 04:23.245
Your wretched mother
and her disciples

04:23.246 --> 04:26.248
tried to put a carving knife
through our baby's heart.

04:26.249 --> 04:30.188
I will happily add
to the body count.

04:30.189 --> 04:32.816
You will do no such thing.

04:32.817 --> 04:35.986
Esther is a master
in the art of possession.

04:35.987 --> 04:38.109
We know whose body
she currently inhabits.

04:38.110 --> 04:42.231
We must decipher her intentions
before she finds a new host.

04:42.232 --> 04:44.266
Was an assassination
attempt on all her children.

04:44.267 --> 04:48.403
I think we can assume her
intentions are decidedly foul.

04:48.404 --> 04:51.139
Well, then we have...

04:51.140 --> 04:54.332
This afternoon
to prepare for the worst.

04:58.246 --> 05:01.917
Bloom is off the rose, I see.

05:01.918 --> 05:04.009
Shut up.

05:06.956 --> 05:10.258
Wondered when you'd show up.

05:10.259 --> 05:11.660
You pupil is waiting.

05:11.661 --> 05:15.025
It's not like you to shirk
your responsibilities.

05:15.026 --> 05:19.801
As you well know, she is
not my burden to bear.

05:19.802 --> 05:22.871
You turned her.
You teach her.

05:22.872 --> 05:25.410
Why'd you come?

05:25.411 --> 05:27.475
I'm looking for
a cooperative witch.

05:27.476 --> 05:29.177
I don't know where Davina is,

05:29.178 --> 05:30.578
and, given the fact
that she's got

05:30.579 --> 05:31.980
your father on a leash,
I wouldn't put her

05:31.981 --> 05:33.877
in the cooperative category.

05:33.878 --> 05:35.183
Not Davina.

05:35.184 --> 05:38.420
Perhaps another witch
on another leash.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.088
What makes you think
I got another witch?

05:40.089 --> 05:42.886
Perhaps the daylight ring
on your new librarian.

05:42.887 --> 05:44.929
Good point.

05:44.930 --> 05:46.594
My memory is a little shaky.

05:46.595 --> 05:49.831
Lucky for you, though, I
know someone who can help.

05:49.832 --> 05:51.532
Gia...

05:58.373 --> 06:02.739
Why don't you take Elijah
to meet our friend Lenore?

06:02.740 --> 06:05.079
If this is your idea of a joke,

06:05.080 --> 06:07.282
I can assure you,
I'm not amused.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.371
Oh, there's nothing funny
about what's going on.

06:09.372 --> 06:12.120
Mikael is back,
witches causing chaos.

06:12.121 --> 06:16.247
If just seems like you need all
the friends that you can get.

06:38.339 --> 06:40.614
You're Oliver, correct?

06:40.615 --> 06:42.383
Do I know you?

06:42.384 --> 06:45.886
No, but I am,
in fact, the person

06:45.887 --> 06:49.757
you're meeting with
this afternoon.

06:49.758 --> 06:54.595
Look. I'm here to meet Cassie.

06:54.596 --> 06:56.096
I don't know
who you are, friend,

06:56.097 --> 06:58.065
but you certainly
are no teenage girl

06:58.066 --> 06:59.712
that has magic powers.

06:59.713 --> 07:03.837
What a keen observation, friend.

07:03.838 --> 07:07.608
My name is Vincent,
and when you speak to me,

07:07.609 --> 07:11.945
you are, in fact,
speaking to Cassie, hmm?

07:11.946 --> 07:16.783
I offer this as proof

07:24.218 --> 07:27.027
so if I decide I don't want

07:27.028 --> 07:31.164
to answer to number two
in chain of command?

07:31.165 --> 07:34.038
Phht.

07:36.137 --> 07:39.973
I could make an example of you,
show your pack what happens

07:39.974 --> 07:42.046
when Cassie's requests
are denied...

07:44.383 --> 07:50.750
Or... We could
start again.

07:55.655 --> 07:58.358
That ring comes at a price,

07:58.359 --> 08:01.760
and you'll begin
paying for it today.

08:14.977 --> 08:16.509
And skip the salad course.

08:16.510 --> 08:18.082
Let's not make this
dreadful evening

08:18.083 --> 08:19.746
any longer than it needs to be.

08:19.747 --> 08:22.782
So I guess letting
Oliver live paid off.

08:22.783 --> 08:24.017
He just informed me
your mother has

08:24.018 --> 08:27.008
a partner in crime,
another witch.

08:27.009 --> 08:30.757
Building alliances in her quest
to destroy us, I imagine.

08:30.758 --> 08:33.226
Why does she hate you
so much, Klaus?

08:33.227 --> 08:35.028
She had 6 kids.

08:35.029 --> 08:37.140
It's not like she doesn't
have the maternal Gene.

08:37.140 --> 08:40.667
7, actually, and
I think at one time,

08:40.668 --> 08:44.068
she loved us very much.

08:45.341 --> 08:48.316
One died before I was born.

08:49.742 --> 08:51.199
I didn't know that.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.646
Years later, my brother
Henrik was killed

08:53.647 --> 08:55.326
by the werewolves
in our village.

08:55.883 --> 08:59.123
The loss of another child
pushed my mother over the edge.

08:59.124 --> 09:04.023
So she used her magic to
turn us into immortals.

09:04.024 --> 09:08.060
I think that's when
she loved us the most,

09:08.061 --> 09:11.063
but it was her undoing.

09:11.064 --> 09:13.733
It triggered
a sequence of events

09:13.734 --> 09:18.671
that led to the reveal
of her long-held secret.

09:18.672 --> 09:20.873
My birth father was the werewolf

09:20.874 --> 09:24.877
whose pack killed
my little brother.

09:24.878 --> 09:26.912
Of course, when
Mikael found out,

09:26.913 --> 09:29.901
he murdered my real father,

09:29.902 --> 09:33.252
and so my mother
lost her lover, too.

09:33.253 --> 09:35.588
Wow.

09:35.589 --> 09:37.990
No wonder she's crazy.

09:37.991 --> 09:42.962
I'm out of my mind having
just given away hope.

09:42.963 --> 09:47.734
I can't imagine if
she'd actually died.

09:49.269 --> 09:51.570
You know, my siblings
used to tell each other

09:51.571 --> 09:55.305
she didn't hate us.

09:55.306 --> 09:59.378
She hated herself
for what we'd become.

09:59.379 --> 10:01.313
I think they believed that,

10:01.314 --> 10:04.583
even after she tried
to kill us all.

10:04.584 --> 10:07.108
What did you believe?

10:07.109 --> 10:09.788
I don't know.

10:09.789 --> 10:12.775
I just knew I wanted her dead.

10:17.262 --> 10:22.434
Well, every good story
needs a wicked witch.

10:22.435 --> 10:26.122
It'll be all the more
satisfying when we melt her.

10:32.010 --> 10:35.347
So you're not much
of a talker, huh?

10:35.348 --> 10:37.082
No problem.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.583
Last guy I hung out with,
he wouldn't shut up.

10:38.584 --> 10:39.951
So I guess I was
due for a change.

10:39.952 --> 10:41.353
Your task is to
lead me to someone.

10:41.354 --> 10:43.848
Let's just do that, shall we?

10:46.224 --> 10:49.160
You want to walk
in silence, cool,

10:49.161 --> 10:52.329
but you're going the wrong way.

10:53.932 --> 10:57.200
Marcel believes
I can instruct you.

10:57.201 --> 10:58.903
First lesson...

10:58.904 --> 11:01.741
Do your best not
to waste my time.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.556
Go away. I'm busy.

11:20.557 --> 11:22.860
Just blatantly
practicing magic, I see.

11:22.861 --> 11:25.997
Herbal remedies for a neighbor
who lost her insurance,

11:25.998 --> 11:27.332
but my guess is, an original

11:27.333 --> 11:28.981
ain't here to talk
neighborhood gossip.

11:28.982 --> 11:30.368
I have a favor to ask you.

11:30.369 --> 11:31.502
Quarter is crawling
with witches.

11:31.503 --> 11:33.805
Go ask one of them.

11:33.806 --> 11:37.809
Don't typically ask
favors of my enemies.

11:37.810 --> 11:41.824
So you come across
the river to bother me.

11:41.825 --> 11:44.148
It's unfortunate, isn't it?

11:44.149 --> 11:48.653
Bureaucracy has not been
kind to your community.

11:48.654 --> 11:51.355
Those tax incentives
on local businesses,

11:51.356 --> 11:53.836
been stalling for months.

11:53.837 --> 11:55.359
Of course, a persuasive person

11:55.360 --> 11:58.174
could potentially
remove any red tape.

11:58.175 --> 12:01.389
I'm listening.

12:01.390 --> 12:03.634
A certain someone...
Let's say, a witch...

12:03.635 --> 12:08.506
Has a troublesome tendency of
jumping into other bodies.

12:08.507 --> 12:10.441
When she does so again,

12:10.442 --> 12:12.734
I'd like to know
into whom she jumps.

12:12.735 --> 12:14.444
Soul branding.

12:14.445 --> 12:16.413
It's a sacrificial spell.

12:16.414 --> 12:18.315
I'm gonna need an item
that's been spelled

12:18.316 --> 12:23.420
by the witch in
question and a python.

12:23.421 --> 12:26.490
I shall retrieve
the enchanted item.

12:26.491 --> 12:28.621
My partner will
take care of the python.

12:28.622 --> 12:29.707
Ew. What?

12:30.228 --> 12:32.429
Second lesson of the day...

12:32.430 --> 12:34.961
Acquisition through
mind compulsion.

12:34.962 --> 12:39.802
How the hell do I do
mind compulsion?

12:49.460 --> 12:53.102
Can I help you?

12:57.968 --> 13:01.724
I'm most certain that you can.

13:07.081 --> 13:10.584
Let me guess.
You need a favor.

13:10.585 --> 13:13.621
Painless one, I promise.

13:13.622 --> 13:18.425
There was a necklace I
gave you a long time ago.

13:18.426 --> 13:21.862
It was a leather strap with
a metal bird on the end.

13:21.863 --> 13:25.299
Yeah. You gave it to me
when I turned 11.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.567
You remember.

13:29.336 --> 13:31.372
Mikael is back.

13:31.373 --> 13:35.603
Elijah is babbling on
about family drama.

13:43.984 --> 13:45.867
Come here, Klaus.

13:49.228 --> 13:52.371
Birds are sacred to the vikings.

13:52.372 --> 13:54.695
It's how we find land.

13:54.696 --> 13:59.333
It's how your father and
I found our home here.

13:59.334 --> 14:01.217
Here.

14:01.218 --> 14:06.764
If ever you are lost or
scared or in need of me,

14:06.765 --> 14:09.767
just clasp the bird
and I will come.

14:09.768 --> 14:12.306
Do the others get one?

14:14.781 --> 14:18.351
I love all my children,

14:18.352 --> 14:23.657
but you, Niklaus,
you're the most special.

14:23.658 --> 14:29.362
That is why I'm giving
this to you and you alone.

14:29.363 --> 14:33.066
Promise me you will
wear it always.

14:33.067 --> 14:34.834
I promise.

14:38.805 --> 14:41.141
Your father may
teach you to hunt,

14:41.142 --> 14:43.342
but I shall teach
you to win the heart

14:43.343 --> 14:45.970
of the prettiest
girl in the village.

14:51.885 --> 14:54.225
Where's your starling necklace?

14:54.226 --> 14:57.103
Oh, must've fallen off.

14:57.104 --> 14:59.134
You need to find it
now, immediately.

14:59.135 --> 15:03.829
It's all right, mother.
I found it.

15:06.632 --> 15:12.437
You owe a great thank-you
to your brother, don't you?

15:13.604 --> 15:15.608
Don't you?

15:15.609 --> 15:18.510
Thank you, Finn.

15:23.382 --> 15:25.218
Do I even want to know
why you're asking

15:25.219 --> 15:28.217
for a necklace that
your mother gave you?

15:28.218 --> 15:31.157
Believe me, Marcel, you want
no part in the latest chapter

15:31.158 --> 15:33.679
of our sprawling family saga.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.197
Thank you for
holding on to this.

15:41.634 --> 15:43.302
I've heard from Kol.

15:43.303 --> 15:44.970
He's still looking
for the young witch.

15:44.971 --> 15:46.639
I imagine he'll
find her soon enough.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.240
A shame he'll miss dinner,

15:48.241 --> 15:52.077
although it is best that his
new identity remains unknown.

15:52.078 --> 15:54.380
This new witch
you've brought me,

15:54.381 --> 15:56.791
Lenore, she seems
rather stubborn.

15:56.792 --> 16:00.519
Mother, I'd be happy to open
her up to new possibilities.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.171
Have Oliver handle her.

16:02.172 --> 16:06.380
Your means of persuasion
will be needed for dinner.

16:06.381 --> 16:08.427
Have we received any
response to our invitation?

16:08.428 --> 16:10.295
I imagine your message
had quite the effect.

16:10.296 --> 16:13.532
Both he and Elijah have
been on the move all day.

16:13.533 --> 16:18.145
Of course.
Clever boys.

16:18.146 --> 16:20.603
Make sure you're ready
for them this evening.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.342
I've handled everything
exactly as you've instructed.

16:23.343 --> 16:27.145
I'd expect nothing
less from you, Finn.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.388
You torture your own?

16:36.389 --> 16:39.412
I persuade.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.862
I'd like for you to do the same.

16:46.098 --> 16:49.033
She had some visitors
earlier today.

16:50.993 --> 16:53.843
I'd like to know
what they wanted.

16:59.644 --> 17:02.101
Don't dally.

17:04.316 --> 17:06.217
Your Algiers witch
is being held captive

17:06.218 --> 17:07.528
in the quarter.

17:07.529 --> 17:08.787
Oh, perfect.

17:08.788 --> 17:10.614
Mother is a step ahead
of us, as usual.

17:10.615 --> 17:11.823
Oliver is with her.

17:11.824 --> 17:12.824
I'll go, and I'll get
her to do the spell,

17:12.825 --> 17:13.858
but I need the necklace.

17:13.858 --> 17:14.992
I don't like this...

17:14.993 --> 17:15.960
No. You don't get to ignore me

17:15.961 --> 17:18.363
for days and suddenly act like
you're concerned, Elijah.

17:18.364 --> 17:20.432
Just for once, please,
will you trust me

17:20.433 --> 17:22.747
that I will do something
and it will get done?

17:29.197 --> 17:31.241
Thank you.

17:32.577 --> 17:34.430
Wait.

17:34.431 --> 17:35.914
I don't want to hear...

17:35.915 --> 17:37.515
There's something else.

17:37.516 --> 17:38.783
A disciple of Marcel's
was instructed

17:38.784 --> 17:40.766
to fetch another ingredient.

17:40.767 --> 17:44.022
Ask for Gia.

17:44.023 --> 17:47.438
Ok.

17:50.260 --> 17:52.697
What's going on with your two?

17:52.698 --> 17:54.097
Nothing.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.604
She's stronger.
That's all that matters.

17:59.605 --> 18:01.038
A snake.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.607
That was my big
lesson of the day...

18:02.608 --> 18:04.251
Snake fetching.

18:04.252 --> 18:06.959
Hold on. You compelled
yourself a snake?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.213
No! I stole the damn thing.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.581
Captain condescension
didn't feel the need

18:10.582 --> 18:13.632
to cover the mind control
chapter in today's lesson.

18:13.633 --> 18:15.686
Did you even try?

18:15.687 --> 18:20.191
I don't even know where
to start trying, Marcel.

18:20.192 --> 18:22.937
Why Elijah?
I'm not stupid.

18:22.938 --> 18:25.663
You want something from him.

18:25.664 --> 18:26.964
I just can't guess
the reason you think

18:26.965 --> 18:29.934
I'm the way to get it.

18:29.935 --> 18:31.902
Actually, I want
something for him,

18:31.903 --> 18:34.115
and it's the same thing
that I want for you.

18:34.116 --> 18:35.658
Which is what?

18:35.659 --> 18:39.745
This. Us.
Our new community.

18:39.746 --> 18:41.645
Look. I learned
my lesson the hard way.

18:41.646 --> 18:43.447
You can't make
your way in this town

18:43.448 --> 18:45.581
unless you have an original
looking out for you.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.618
Klaus is so fixated
on those wolves,

18:47.619 --> 18:49.620
and Elijah is so
wrapped up in centuries

18:49.621 --> 18:51.789
of his family's old crap
that he can't see it,

18:51.790 --> 18:53.357
but we need him.

18:53.358 --> 18:57.633
We need him to see us
as family, too.

18:59.596 --> 19:05.736
I couldn't even get my own
family to care about me.

19:05.737 --> 19:08.772
How am I supposed
to win him over?

19:08.773 --> 19:12.069
I've known that man 200 years.

19:12.070 --> 19:14.978
He's cranky.
He's fussy.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.613
He can ride your last nerve,

19:17.614 --> 19:22.319
but he has
an Achilles' heel, ok?

19:22.320 --> 19:25.828
He can't help trying
to fix what's broken.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.426
You don't need to be anything

19:29.427 --> 19:32.295
other than what
you already are...

19:32.296 --> 19:35.337
Someone who needs his help.

19:44.674 --> 19:47.210
Are these outfits
really necessary?

19:47.211 --> 19:50.247
Appears as though we're
showing respect, Niklaus.

19:50.248 --> 19:51.681
Mother will be more
likely to surrender

19:51.682 --> 19:53.283
her true intentions.

19:53.284 --> 19:54.851
Well, I doubt
her guard will drop

19:54.852 --> 19:56.186
just because I'm dressed
like a bloody lawyer.

19:56.187 --> 19:58.521
We need every advantage
we can get, Niklaus.

19:58.522 --> 20:01.257
You always did excel
at diplomacy.

20:01.258 --> 20:02.792
Just know if she tries anything,

20:02.793 --> 20:05.462
I'll tear her new body
to pieces.

20:05.463 --> 20:07.697
Ha ha ha!

20:07.698 --> 20:10.581
You two haven't changed a bit.

20:13.236 --> 20:17.384
Linens and silk can't disguise
your pathetic self-loathing,

20:17.385 --> 20:21.077
and you, despite the
arrogant facade,

20:21.078 --> 20:23.724
you're still the same
paranoid little boy

20:23.725 --> 20:28.766
full of hate and fear.

20:34.991 --> 20:37.627
Forgive me.

20:37.628 --> 20:40.866
I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

20:40.867 --> 20:43.866
You mean, you
don't recognize me?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.204
Huh?

20:45.205 --> 20:49.583
So much for the unbreakable
bonds of family, huh?

20:49.584 --> 20:52.174
Always and forever, indeed.

20:52.175 --> 20:55.878
It's been a long time...

20:55.879 --> 20:58.446
Finn.

20:59.908 --> 21:07.054
Now that the introductions are
out of the way, let's eat.

21:11.643 --> 21:13.945
They worked
her over pretty good.

21:13.946 --> 21:15.513
We need to
get her out of here.

21:15.514 --> 21:18.609
What? Well, then what?

21:18.610 --> 21:20.518
They'll know that I let her go.

21:20.519 --> 21:22.754
Look. You asked me to
infiltrate Cassie's coven.

21:22.755 --> 21:26.257
I'm not gonna blow my cover for
some has-been, hippie witch,

21:26.258 --> 21:29.327
no offense.

21:29.328 --> 21:32.130
I guess we could always make
it look like you got jumped,

21:32.131 --> 21:35.033
tell Cassie that Lenore
got rescued by her people.

21:35.034 --> 21:36.501
Let me guess.

21:36.502 --> 21:38.170
You want to beat
the hell out of me,

21:38.171 --> 21:39.466
make it look convincing?

21:39.467 --> 21:43.775
Oh, I can't say
I won't enjoy it.

21:43.776 --> 21:45.676
Ok. Just...

21:45.677 --> 21:48.304
Just not the face, ok?

21:48.980 --> 21:50.648
Mm.

21:52.272 --> 21:54.318
What an aromatic Bordeaux.

21:54.319 --> 21:57.622
Well, it was a challenge
to find a good pairing.

21:57.623 --> 22:00.401
What wine goes well
with treachery?

22:00.402 --> 22:01.526
Don't pout, brother.

22:01.527 --> 22:05.029
Tonight is meant to be
a happy occasion.

22:09.185 --> 22:11.335
What, exactly,
are we celebrating?

22:11.336 --> 22:13.751
Well, my return, of course.

22:13.752 --> 22:18.213
Remember, I spent
900 years, right,

22:18.214 --> 22:20.544
lying daggered in a box.

22:20.545 --> 22:23.447
I'm rather enjoying
this new body,

22:23.448 --> 22:28.185
strolling about your lovely city
that you've made your home.

22:28.186 --> 22:32.122
Do tell me, what'd I miss?

22:32.123 --> 22:34.558
Regale me with
your contributions

22:34.559 --> 22:37.861
to society...
Medicine,

22:37.862 --> 22:41.865
philosophy, art...

22:41.866 --> 22:44.234
Or have you two
merely cut a path

22:44.235 --> 22:46.870
of destruction across time?

22:46.871 --> 22:48.872
The last time we met,
you were helping our mother

22:48.873 --> 22:50.701
try to annihilate the lot of us.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.043
Let's not throw stones
in glass houses.

22:53.044 --> 22:55.414
Are we expecting another guest?

22:55.415 --> 22:58.382
Mother will sit at the head,

22:58.383 --> 23:01.084
and as for the seat
across from me,

23:01.085 --> 23:04.510
that's reserved for
another of our clan.

23:04.511 --> 23:07.426
Care to wager an educated guess?

23:07.427 --> 23:09.793
How about a paranoid one?

23:09.794 --> 23:11.228
Well, there's no way
Kol would listen

23:11.229 --> 23:12.696
to anything other than his ego.

23:12.697 --> 23:15.599
And yet our mother has made
such a compelling argument

23:15.600 --> 23:19.274
that even he, the wildest
of us Mikaelsons, has seen

23:19.275 --> 23:24.841
the error of his ways and
accepted his new form with vigor.

23:24.842 --> 23:30.661
Change, dear brothers,
is inevitable.

23:30.662 --> 23:35.385
You would dare
face us as a mortal?

23:35.386 --> 23:38.747
The only thing inevitable
is your death.

23:43.238 --> 23:44.961
Hmm...

23:44.962 --> 23:47.564
I suppose the honor of carving

23:47.565 --> 23:49.925
should go to the oldest.

23:52.831 --> 23:55.561
We have much to discuss.

23:55.562 --> 23:59.275
It's gonna
be ok, I promise.

23:59.276 --> 24:01.650
What's your dog in this fight?

24:01.651 --> 24:03.402
You're not a Mikaelson.

24:03.403 --> 24:05.615
I sort of am in spirit.

24:05.616 --> 24:07.114
The werewolf mother.

24:07.115 --> 24:09.446
Turned witch rescuer,
apparently.

24:09.447 --> 24:12.411
Listen. Can we do
the spell, or not?

24:12.412 --> 24:14.621
After what that bitch
and her lackey did to me,

24:14.622 --> 24:17.493
I'll do any spell you want.

24:17.494 --> 24:19.501
I'm rather
enjoying my evening.

24:19.502 --> 24:22.045
And I'd enjoy you
getting to the point.

24:22.046 --> 24:25.215
I had 900 years to
learn to be patient,

24:25.216 --> 24:27.570
although I am curious why you

24:27.571 --> 24:30.637
kept me daggered in
a box for so long.

24:30.638 --> 24:34.310
You were daggered for being
an ever-simpering sycophant.

24:34.311 --> 24:35.812
Did mother bring you
back from the dead

24:35.813 --> 24:38.114
so you could wash her knickers?

24:38.115 --> 24:41.482
She raised me because
I was treated unfairly,

24:41.483 --> 24:44.954
cheated out of all but the
smallest portion of my life.

24:44.955 --> 24:47.957
Elijah, I can understand such
cruelty coming from him,

24:47.958 --> 24:52.295
but I always thought of you as
being the compassionate one.

24:52.296 --> 24:55.450
What did I do to deserve you
turning your back on me?

24:55.451 --> 24:57.289
Were you afraid of Niklaus?

24:57.290 --> 25:00.102
Are you still,
or perhaps jealousy

25:00.103 --> 25:03.333
is why you kept me
locked in a box.

25:03.334 --> 25:05.207
You coveted the duties
of the eldest brother,

25:05.208 --> 25:07.409
in which case, you had
near on a millennium

25:07.410 --> 25:09.278
to fix the problems
of this family

25:09.279 --> 25:13.382
and instead produced
9 centuries of failure.

25:13.383 --> 25:16.892
You might reside...
Somewhat parasitically,

25:16.893 --> 25:19.888
I might add...
In another body,

25:19.889 --> 25:22.558
but let me assure you,
in 900 years,

25:22.559 --> 25:26.962
your tedious sentiments
remain quite the same.

25:26.963 --> 25:31.281
You see, Finn, like father,

25:31.282 --> 25:34.239
you've always despised
our supernatural existence.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.238
Father, of course, slaughtered

25:36.239 --> 25:38.740
and consumed his own,
whereas you,

25:38.741 --> 25:42.010
you became pretentious and
dull, much like this meal.

25:42.011 --> 25:46.615
I will not ask you again.
Where is mother?

25:46.616 --> 25:53.090
Ah, my darling
son, I've missed you, too.

26:04.337 --> 26:05.964
So will this take long?

26:05.965 --> 26:07.499
You want me to soul brand
the resurrected spirit

26:07.500 --> 26:09.069
of a 1,000-year-old witch.

26:09.070 --> 26:12.771
It's best I take my time
and do it right.

26:12.772 --> 26:16.274
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.376
No one should ever
have to lose a child.

26:18.377 --> 26:21.410
No. No one should.

26:23.381 --> 26:25.850
You have the talisman?

26:25.851 --> 26:27.040
Yeah.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.189
So how does this work?

26:31.190 --> 26:33.958
You brand Esther with the
spell, and then what?

26:33.959 --> 26:35.526
The next time she
jumps into a body,

26:35.527 --> 26:37.161
she'll be marked with
a distinctive symbol

26:37.162 --> 26:39.221
on the back of her hand.

26:39.222 --> 26:41.032
This way, you always
know who she is.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.020
I'd sooner know why she's here.

26:43.021 --> 26:44.669
When Esther held you captive,

26:44.670 --> 26:47.071
did she give you any idea
why she's doing all this?

26:47.072 --> 26:49.741
Love.

26:49.742 --> 26:52.844
How hard did they hit you?

26:52.845 --> 26:58.196
What besides love inspires
such pain and cruelty?

27:00.059 --> 27:01.491
And Esther...

27:10.962 --> 27:13.297
Her love is...

27:13.298 --> 27:17.101
Very, very strong.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.431
Why don't you say
what you came here to say

27:19.432 --> 27:21.739
so this wretched night can end.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.707
It pains me that you and Elijah

27:23.708 --> 27:26.343
look at me with such disdain.

27:26.344 --> 27:28.612
I wish you could see
that my every action

27:28.613 --> 27:30.815
has been to protect you.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.917
You actually believe
that, don't you?

27:32.918 --> 27:35.486
I knew you were a liar,

27:35.487 --> 27:37.904
but now I see you're
utterly delusional.

27:37.905 --> 27:40.090
If you can, forget the
hatred that you cling to

27:40.091 --> 27:44.035
and remember all the times
I've mended and healed you.

27:44.036 --> 27:45.195
Ha ha!

27:45.196 --> 27:46.897
Elijah, do you recall
the day Niklaus

27:46.898 --> 27:49.800
challenged your
father to a duel?

27:49.801 --> 27:52.673
Did I leave your brother
to die alone?

27:52.674 --> 27:54.214
What did I say
when you came to me

27:54.706 --> 27:57.841
and asked me to help him?

27:57.842 --> 28:00.144
That you would rather die

28:00.145 --> 28:03.180
than to watch any
of your children suffer.

28:03.181 --> 28:06.316
Aagh! Oh!

28:06.317 --> 28:07.784
Tell me what happened.

28:07.785 --> 28:09.189
I challenged him.

28:09.190 --> 28:11.054
What were you thinking?

28:11.055 --> 28:13.557
I thought if I could
just best him just once,

28:13.558 --> 28:15.125
he would see that I'm worthy.

28:15.126 --> 28:18.295
You need to hold still.

28:18.296 --> 28:22.451
D'aagh!

28:23.001 --> 28:24.705
Oh...

28:24.706 --> 28:28.004
Niklaus, calm down.

28:28.005 --> 28:32.242
Everything is going to be fine.

28:32.243 --> 28:34.256
He laughed at my challenge.

28:34.257 --> 28:37.339
He said he would
take this from me

28:37.340 --> 28:40.095
as a prize after defeating me.

28:40.096 --> 28:44.287
We began to fight, and
he knocked me down.

28:44.288 --> 28:50.760
He cut the bird from my
neck, and I grew so angry,

28:50.761 --> 28:56.565
I hit him again and again,
and then I cut him.

28:59.335 --> 29:01.238
What happened next?

29:01.239 --> 29:07.677
The look on his face, I'd
never seen it before,

29:07.678 --> 29:11.585
and I was so proud.

29:11.586 --> 29:18.759
Mother, I held this up to
show him I had kept my prize,

29:18.760 --> 29:21.258
and then he...

29:21.259 --> 29:22.825
Why would...

29:22.826 --> 29:25.628
Your father in his rage

29:25.629 --> 29:28.364
struck you with his sword.

29:28.365 --> 29:31.438
I wouldn't let him
take this from me.

29:31.439 --> 29:34.649
It was your gift to me.

29:34.650 --> 29:39.708
You're a good boy, Niklaus.
You did the right thing.

29:40.428 --> 29:42.778
The necklace.

29:47.583 --> 29:50.253
It wasn't a spell to protect me.

29:50.254 --> 29:54.089
Promise me you will
wear it always.

29:55.458 --> 29:57.297
It made me weak.

29:57.298 --> 30:00.596
I sought to protect
you from yourself.

30:00.597 --> 30:01.931
If you would've
killed your father

30:01.932 --> 30:04.567
in that duel or anyone else
over the course of your life,

30:04.568 --> 30:06.389
you would've
activated your curse.

30:06.390 --> 30:08.437
You ruined me.

30:08.438 --> 30:10.439
You left me to suffer
at the hands of a father

30:10.440 --> 30:12.208
who valued only strength.

30:12.209 --> 30:13.909
I kept you from becoming a beast

30:13.910 --> 30:15.607
for as long as I possibly could.

30:15.608 --> 30:19.081
Oh, you lied to me to hide
your own transgressions

30:19.082 --> 30:21.238
because of your own fear!

30:21.239 --> 30:23.528
My whole life,
I sought the approval

30:23.529 --> 30:25.867
I was denied by the man
I thought was my father.

30:25.868 --> 30:28.590
You turned me into
the weakling he hated!

30:28.591 --> 30:30.163
Look at me!

30:30.164 --> 30:33.538
You rant, and you rage about
the monster I've become,

30:33.539 --> 30:35.041
but you, mother,

30:35.565 --> 30:38.966
you are the author
of everything I am.

31:05.127 --> 31:08.095
She's gone.

31:12.167 --> 31:15.582
Where is she?

31:37.712 --> 31:40.687
Are you ok?

31:41.896 --> 31:44.317
Yes.

31:44.318 --> 31:45.196
You sure?

31:45.197 --> 31:47.866
Just getting my bearings.

31:47.867 --> 31:49.364
Oh...

31:49.365 --> 31:51.197
The mark.

31:54.437 --> 31:58.084
It's you, isn't it?

31:58.085 --> 32:01.291
Esther.

32:03.759 --> 32:06.006
Where is our mother?

32:06.007 --> 32:09.137
Where am I?
What's happening?

32:10.733 --> 32:15.370
Leave her.
She's a puppet.

32:15.371 --> 32:17.145
Niklaus, look at her.

32:17.146 --> 32:18.740
She has absolutely no idea.

32:18.741 --> 32:21.816
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

32:21.817 --> 32:25.649
Shut up.
Stop talking right now.

32:28.971 --> 32:32.327
Our mother orchestrates
this entire evening

32:32.328 --> 32:36.524
just to torture us
and then simply vanishes.

32:37.793 --> 32:41.127
Why?

32:41.128 --> 32:43.198
What if we are not
the only minds

32:43.199 --> 32:45.600
she was hoping
to poison tonight?

32:50.096 --> 32:54.275
Go ahead.
You can answer it.

32:54.276 --> 32:58.520
Elijah, I'm at Lenore's shop.

32:58.521 --> 33:00.355
That'll be enough.

33:00.356 --> 33:02.691
They're gonna come for me.

33:02.692 --> 33:06.855
My darling, it's been
the idea all along.

33:06.856 --> 33:08.389
Why would she want Hayley?

33:08.390 --> 33:09.958
To kill her, to punish us,

33:09.959 --> 33:11.960
to learn the truth
about the child,

33:11.961 --> 33:13.261
for one of any
number of reasons,

33:13.262 --> 33:14.529
all of which will be
rendered moot

33:14.530 --> 33:17.580
when I send her
screaming back to hell.

33:17.581 --> 33:20.602
It's so lovely
to finally meet you.

33:20.603 --> 33:23.371
Tell me, do my sons
ever acknowledge

33:23.372 --> 33:25.668
the good you bring
into their lives?

33:25.669 --> 33:28.671
After all, it was you
who gave them hope.

33:28.672 --> 33:31.312
The promise of a child
shows us all

33:31.313 --> 33:34.719
the possibilities of
a future that could be.

33:34.720 --> 33:37.418
Children are meant to save us

33:37.419 --> 33:40.141
from the worst parts
of who we are,

33:40.142 --> 33:42.490
a truth that makes
my own circumstances

33:42.491 --> 33:45.483
all the more tragic,
wouldn't you say?

33:45.484 --> 33:47.690
I don't pity you, Esther.

33:47.691 --> 33:49.797
Hmm.

33:49.798 --> 33:51.832
It's a terrible thing
for a mother

33:51.833 --> 33:57.240
to fail her child,
as you well know...

33:58.639 --> 34:03.778
But now I offer you freedom,
the gift of a new body,

34:03.779 --> 34:07.081
freedom from being a hybrid.

34:07.082 --> 34:10.255
I have the ability
to return to you

34:10.255 --> 34:13.217
all that you have lost, Hayley,
to make it so you can have

34:13.789 --> 34:19.304
a family of your own, more
children of your own.

34:22.376 --> 34:24.598
Wouldn't that be nice?

34:24.599 --> 34:25.966
I assume
I have the misfortune

34:25.967 --> 34:28.467
of speaking to my mother.

34:30.804 --> 34:33.862
You hide behind your
spells like a coward.

34:33.862 --> 34:36.404
I did not come here to wage war.

34:39.380 --> 34:42.315
Everything you do
is an act of war.

34:42.317 --> 34:45.335
If you touch her, so help me...

34:45.335 --> 34:46.954
Hayley is free to go.

34:46.955 --> 34:50.043
I've spoken my piece.
She knows why I'm here.

34:50.045 --> 34:53.927
I have come to heal
our family, Elijah.

34:53.928 --> 34:57.222
Well, that's a grim
sentiment coming from you.

34:57.223 --> 34:59.302
Go now.

35:00.634 --> 35:05.146
My intent was never to harm,
only to heal, as I have already

35:05.147 --> 35:07.774
healed your brothers
Finn and Kol.

35:07.775 --> 35:12.512
For you, I will undo
everything that has been done,

35:12.513 --> 35:17.984
thereby giving you a new life,
one without the vampire curse

35:17.985 --> 35:21.074
I inflicted upon you.

35:27.327 --> 35:32.382
Ask Hayley to share with
you my loving proposition.

35:32.383 --> 35:36.386
You're a fool if you think we'll
accept anything you offer.

35:36.387 --> 35:40.539
Oh, you are wrong, Niklaus.

35:42.164 --> 35:45.577
There will come a time,
my darling...

35:48.546 --> 35:51.550
When you will beg for it.

35:54.471 --> 35:56.473
Of course she used
those damn birds

35:56.474 --> 35:57.807
to make her escape.

35:57.808 --> 36:00.076
Besides mother's offer of
rebirth, what else did she say?

36:00.077 --> 36:01.044
I don't know.
She rambled a lot.

36:01.045 --> 36:05.515
She blamed the two of you for
what happened to hope, to me.

36:05.516 --> 36:09.122
Well, I trust you're not
thinking of taking her offer.

36:11.569 --> 36:13.590
Hayley, I'm talking to you.

36:13.591 --> 36:15.224
What do you want me
to say, Klaus?

36:15.225 --> 36:16.626
I lost my daughter, so, yeah,

36:16.627 --> 36:18.494
when your mother offers
to wipe the slate clean,

36:18.495 --> 36:20.847
excuse me if I'm tempted.

36:20.848 --> 36:24.100
By the way, thanks for
your help tonight, Elijah.

36:24.101 --> 36:26.602
I'm sorry that it takes
me being in danger

36:26.603 --> 36:28.837
for you to even talk to me.

36:29.806 --> 36:34.310
Leave her.
I need you with me.

36:34.311 --> 36:38.014
Our mother, Elijah, the woman
brought us into the world,

36:38.015 --> 36:42.818
made us what we are, and the
whole time, she lied to me.

36:42.819 --> 36:46.159
She made me weak.

36:47.857 --> 36:51.294
You were never weak, Niklaus.

36:51.295 --> 36:57.299
You are and you have always
been the most fierce of us all.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.215
In a thousand years,
I've never seen anyone

36:59.216 --> 37:04.015
successfully stand against you,
not even our wicked father,

37:04.016 --> 37:08.978
not one of the countless
devoted to your destruction.

37:08.979 --> 37:12.014
You will protect our home,

37:12.015 --> 37:14.383
even in the face of an
adversary such as our mother,

37:14.384 --> 37:19.354
because that, brother,
that is what you do.

37:26.128 --> 37:31.626
You remain ever the
wise counsel, brother.

37:31.627 --> 37:35.436
The rest of the family could
learn something from you.

Yeah. That's...

Your music, the joy you felt

39:32.787 --> 39:34.454
I can help you.

39:36.290 --> 39:38.628
Why?

39:38.629 --> 39:40.528
Because if someone
had done the same thing

39:40.529 --> 39:45.199
for myself and my siblings,
I'm quite certain history

39:45.200 --> 39:48.168
would have unfolded differently.

40:01.048 --> 40:03.350
Where were you?

40:03.351 --> 40:05.358
I saw Elijah.

40:07.221 --> 40:09.023
You were right.

40:09.024 --> 40:12.745
He found something
he wanted to fix.

40:12.746 --> 40:15.229
He's gonna help me.

40:22.653 --> 40:25.539
He's gonna help us all.

40:25.540 --> 40:27.174
Now,
you must have known

40:27.175 --> 40:29.512
they would never give in
without a fight.

40:29.513 --> 40:31.545
Of course. Tonight
was not an ultimatum.

40:31.546 --> 40:33.349
It was an invitation.

40:33.350 --> 40:35.082
Just want to get them thinking.

40:35.083 --> 40:37.551
After all, only those
who know they are lost

40:37.552 --> 40:39.730
will ask to be found.

40:39.731 --> 40:43.526
They're defiant by nature, and
they've grown very strong.

40:43.527 --> 40:47.394
How do you expect to show
them the error of their ways?

40:47.395 --> 40:51.565
I will systematically destroy
everything they hold dear.

40:51.566 --> 40:53.467
I've already taken
the wolves from Niklaus

40:53.468 --> 40:54.935
and made them my own.

40:54.936 --> 40:57.604
It is time now to focus
on the prodigal son Marcel

40:57.605 --> 41:02.442
and his small nest of
vampires across the river.

41:02.443 --> 41:06.079
Now that we have cleansed
the quarter of his kind,

41:06.080 --> 41:09.516
perhaps it's time
to turn our attention

41:09.517 --> 41:13.886
to the outskirts
of our beautiful home.

41:13.887 --> 41:18.758
We will take their pride,
their joy, their love.

41:18.759 --> 41:22.362
We will lay it all to ruin,

41:22.363 --> 41:25.064
and when they are at
their lowest point,

41:25.065 --> 41:28.067
in their deepest despair,

41:28.068 --> 41:31.905
they will have no choice
but to beg me

41:31.906 --> 41:38.845
to release them from their
pain, and because I love them,

41:38.846 --> 41:41.280
I will.
