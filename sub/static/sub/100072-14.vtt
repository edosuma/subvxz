00:38.247 --> 00:39.956
Ah! This is so exciting!

00:39.957 --> 00:42.124
I can't believe Daddy actually bought

00:42.125 --> 00:44.001
a Minor League Baseball team.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.003
I love coming to the ballpark.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.131
Drunken Irish in front
of a fishbowl of minorities.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.550
What could go wrong?

00:53.345 --> 00:54.971
Dad, what are you doing?

00:54.972 --> 00:56.597
This is tailgating, son.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.099
It's where you bring all your trash

00:58.100 --> 00:59.934
and you leave it
for someone else to deal with.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.270
Here, help me get this
Christmas tree out of the back.

01:08.527 --> 01:11.112
Meg's estrogen supplements?

01:11.113 --> 01:13.322
I'll take that. Thank you.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.616
So, what do you think
of your first tailgate, Stewie?

01:15.617 --> 01:16.659
It's so great.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.327
Dad gave me a sip of beer.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.371
I'm gonna mention that to my teacher,

01:20.372 --> 01:21.914
and it's gonna be a big problem.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.708
Oh, there's Bonnie.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.210
We always have so much fun
at these things.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.504
Hey, Bonnie, who's on first?

01:28.505 --> 01:31.966
Who, the person's name or the pronoun?

01:31.967 --> 01:34.260
Ha! And it goes on like this.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.678
Hey, Joe, how's it going?

01:35.679 --> 01:37.346
Sorry, Peter, no time to talk.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.265
- It's my day to shine.
- What?

01:39.266 --> 01:41.726
Yeah. Handicapped
person at the ballpark...

01:41.727 --> 01:44.478
Ramps, private escort, meet the team.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.188
Is there a Joe Swanson?

01:46.189 --> 01:47.940
Right here!

01:47.941 --> 01:50.443
Meet me at that sad balcony!

01:53.989 --> 01:55.239
Well, here it is.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.407
What do you think?

01:56.408 --> 01:58.326
Wow, Daddy, it's beautiful!

01:58.327 --> 01:59.869
Yeah, it's really great up here.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.662
There's free food, a bar,

02:01.663 --> 02:04.165
and you can drop
a plastic spider on a string

02:04.166 --> 02:06.334
- on your friends below.
- Really?

02:06.335 --> 02:08.002
Go, Quahog!

02:09.003 --> 02:11.505
I fell trying to lower a spider.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.174
Good afternoon, fans,

02:13.175 --> 02:15.593
and welcome to Minor League Baseball.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.429
<i>I'm your announcer,
Johnny "Feedback" Robinson,</i>

02:18.430 --> 02:19.680
<i>here to tell you about all the...</i>

02:19.681 --> 02:21.349
<i>Whoa! Hold on, hold on.</i>

02:21.350 --> 02:22.933
<i>Step back from the mic.</i>

02:22.934 --> 02:24.060
<i>Like this?</i>

02:24.061 --> 02:25.269
<i>Okay?</i>

02:25.270 --> 02:27.438
<i>Now for tonight's starting lineup!</i>

02:27.439 --> 02:28.898
<i>First, your coach,</i>

02:28.899 --> 02:31.275
<i>Frank "Cardiac Arrest" Ross.</i>

02:32.361 --> 02:33.861
<i>And the pitching coach,</i>

02:33.862 --> 02:37.365
<i>Bill "Doesn't Know CPR" McGillicuddy.</i>

02:37.366 --> 02:39.867
Damn it! Where am I gonna get
another coach?

02:41.286 --> 02:42.745
I'm on vacation!

02:42.746 --> 02:44.705
Aw, darn. That would've been funny.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.458
Hey, Griffin, you want to be
a Minor League Baseball coach?

02:47.459 --> 02:48.459
Seriously?

02:48.460 --> 02:49.877
Heck yeah, I do!

02:49.878 --> 02:51.420
Oh, man, I haven't been this excited

02:51.421 --> 02:53.130
since I met Cool Hand Luke.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.134
Wow. You got a cool hand, Luke.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.387
Yeah, well, he doesn't follow the crowd.

02:59.388 --> 03:02.264
He plays by his own rules,
and women respond to that.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.724
Check this out.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.394
"Hey, baby. You're looking fine."

03:08.146 --> 03:09.605
"Mmm. Oh, yeah.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.148
Mmm. Mmm."

03:11.149 --> 03:12.566
Oh, that's hot.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.984
You mind if I get in on that?

03:13.985 --> 03:16.404
"Oh, yeah.

03:16.405 --> 03:17.446
"Mmm.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.739
"Just FYI,

03:18.740 --> 03:21.659
I'm either gonna finish
too quick or not at all."

03:21.660 --> 03:23.828
All right, Griffin,
that cutaway convinced me

03:23.829 --> 03:25.663
that you are, in fact, sure of this.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.957
Now get down in that dugout
and do your job, Coach.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.375
Aw, thanks, Carter!

03:29.376 --> 03:30.668
I won't let you down,

03:30.669 --> 03:33.587
or my name's not
Peter "Little Bingo" Griffin.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.297
All right, little bingo. Let's go.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.174
Little bingo here. Not a lot of bingo.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.759
Don't want to play bingo
for a long time.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.177
Short game of bingo.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.595
Don't even have to play a little bingo.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.930
Could play a little banjo.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.682
Whoa, this guy knows what he's doing.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.851
I don't know. I'm not convinced yet.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.936
Ducks on the pond, guys,
ducks on the pond.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.646
Chewing up bits of bread,
pooping in the pond.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.189
Ducks on the pond. Some of 'em brown,

03:52.190 --> 03:53.274
some of 'em prettier...
All of 'em ducks.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.316
Ducks on the pond.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.612
I would follow him into hell.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.325
Morning, team.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.786
Peter, do you really have
to wear those in the house?

04:05.787 --> 04:08.205
Yes, I do. I'm a baseball coach now.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.292
You knew that when you married me.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.335
Peter, you want some eggs?

04:13.336 --> 04:15.630
I actually brought my
own breakfast today, thank you.

04:17.923 --> 04:18.923
Ow. Gross!

04:18.925 --> 04:20.259
What the hell, Dad?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.803
Meg, can I, um...

04:22.804 --> 04:24.806
can I see you in my office, please?

04:25.849 --> 04:28.392
Hey, thanks for coming. Take a seat.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.895
- What's up?
- This is...

04:30.896 --> 04:33.105
This is really the toughest part
of the business, isn't it?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.982
Oh, my God, are you trading me?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.275
Look, it's nothing personal.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.277
You've been very professional
as a family member,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.321
but... here's the thing...

04:40.322 --> 04:42.490
We're sending you down to <i> American Dad.</i>

04:42.491 --> 04:44.408
No! What? No!

04:44.409 --> 04:46.035
Look, they're not excited
about it either.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.328
I guess I could call <i> The Orville.</i>

04:47.329 --> 04:50.623
I'll do <i> American Dad.</i>

04:54.294 --> 04:56.253
Okay, boys, this is it.
Bottom of the ninth.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.422
We just need a bleep,
a bloop, a walk, a balk,

04:58.423 --> 05:00.382
another balk,
and, of course, a little bingo.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.384
Let's go!

05:05.388 --> 05:07.515
That's it, boys! Walk-off home run!

05:07.516 --> 05:09.141
Get out there and tear his clothes off!

05:09.142 --> 05:10.351
He just won for us!

05:10.352 --> 05:11.603
Get him!

05:15.315 --> 05:16.690
Yeah! Punch him!

05:16.691 --> 05:17.900
Good! Curb him!

05:17.901 --> 05:19.735
Okay, now pull his shirt over his head

05:19.736 --> 05:21.111
and waterboard him with the Gatorade.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.530
Yes! Cut him with knives!

05:22.531 --> 05:24.698
Good! Burn him with fire! Yes!

05:24.699 --> 05:26.534
Way to go, you!

05:26.535 --> 05:29.287
All this is happening
because you did something well.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.878
I'm sorry, Lois.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.296
I, I'm gassed.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.090
What's wrong?
You want me to get the wedge?

05:41.091 --> 05:43.300
- What's going on, Coach?
- I'm losing it.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.802
Maybe we should call in the kid.

05:44.803 --> 05:45.886
Hey, no problem.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.096
You went eight full minutes.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.140
Bring in the kid!

06:02.153 --> 06:04.613
All right. Bring us home, kid,
bring us home.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.115
Little bingo. Ducks on the pond,

06:06.116 --> 06:07.741
furry ducks, little man in a boat.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.328
If you can find it,
you're a better man than I am.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.250
I can't believe
the Quahog Whooping Scalpers

06:16.251 --> 06:18.252
are actually going
to the playoffs this year.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.212
To Coach Griffin!

06:20.213 --> 06:21.922
Hey, thanks, guys.

06:21.923 --> 06:25.009
All right, it's time for me to
Oakley-load for tonight's game.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.719
Okay. Forehead Oakleys,

06:26.720 --> 06:27.845
round-the-neck Oakleys,

06:27.846 --> 06:29.179
brim-of-the-cap Oakleys,

06:29.180 --> 06:30.347
back-of-the-head Oakleys,

06:30.348 --> 06:31.932
tucked-into-my-shirt-collar Oakleys,

06:31.933 --> 06:34.101
Everglades fan boat Oakleys,

06:34.102 --> 06:35.686
and Ray-Bans for my eyes,

06:35.687 --> 06:37.980
because Oakleys are terrible.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.736
<i>All right, it's Bucket-O-Shrimp Night,</i>

06:43.737 --> 06:47.114
<i>brought to you by Rocco's
Lukewarm Refrigerator Trucks.</i>

06:47.115 --> 06:49.867
<i>Rocco's... We got it there, didn't we?</i>

06:49.868 --> 06:51.952
Hmm.

06:51.953 --> 06:55.748
That child's beach toy full of
gray baseball stadium shellfish

06:55.749 --> 06:57.583
isn't sitting right for some reason.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.337
Maybe I should smoke a cigarette
for the first time ever.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.091
Okay, not a fix for now

07:06.092 --> 07:08.552
but definitely something I
immediately want to keep doing.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.471
Probably best to just add something hot

07:10.472 --> 07:11.930
and acidic to the mix.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.098
Burnt coffee!

07:13.099 --> 07:15.768
Get your burnt, re-microwaved coffee!

07:15.769 --> 07:17.103
I'll take one!

07:21.691 --> 07:23.150
Oh, boy.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.903
Mr. Pewterschmidt, I think I
have to go to the bathroom, sir.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.238
Not now. We're about
to do the national anthem.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.837
Oh, boy.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.589
It's like Medusa's hair in there.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.133
I can't stop it.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.136
Must... sit in a way...

07:51.137 --> 07:53.472
that pinches my sphincter...

07:53.473 --> 07:54.598
shut.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.355
<i>Oh, my!</i>

08:01.356 --> 08:02.940
<i>Looks like Coach Peter Griffin</i>

08:02.941 --> 08:05.859
<i>is taking a knee
during your national anthem.</i>

08:05.860 --> 08:07.277
<i>I'm Canadian.</i>

08:07.278 --> 08:09.530
<i>What is he thinking "aboot"?</i>

08:09.531 --> 08:10.614
What's he doing?

08:10.615 --> 08:12.825
He's not protesting the anthem, is he?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.370
Uh-oh.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.621
Shrimp buckets!

08:17.622 --> 08:19.123
All-you-can-eat shrimp!

08:19.124 --> 08:20.750
Right here, dude.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.465
<i>Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker,</i>

08:28.466 --> 08:30.467
<i>joined tonight by a very special guest,</i>

08:30.468 --> 08:33.303
<i>Channel Five's own Tom Tucker Senior,</i>

08:33.304 --> 08:35.806
<i>who hasn't been on the air since 1964.</i>

08:35.807 --> 08:37.224
<i>Take it away, Dad.</i>

08:37.225 --> 08:38.392
<i>Thanks, Tom.</i>

08:38.393 --> 08:39.643
<i>More and more women are choosing</i>

08:39.644 --> 08:41.227
<i>to work outside the home.</i>

08:41.229 --> 08:42.813
<i>I call them prostitutes...</i>

08:42.813 --> 08:44.481
<i>And that's a wrap for Tom Senior.</i>

08:44.482 --> 08:45.858
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

08:45.859 --> 08:48.068
<i>local baseball coach Peter Griffin</i>

08:48.069 --> 08:50.154
<i>took a knee during
the national anthem today,</i>

08:50.155 --> 08:52.281
<i>joining the fight for equalit.</i>

08:52.282 --> 08:53.866
Well, just finished a load.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.325
Gonna do the laundry next.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.785
Dad, check it out!

08:56.786 --> 08:59.705
You're on the news for taking
a knee during the anthem.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.206
- What?
- They called you a hero

09:01.207 --> 09:02.666
and an activist.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.834
- A hero?
- Yeah.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.169
Because you took a knee
to support the fight

09:05.170 --> 09:07.045
against police brutality.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.048
Yeah, yes. That's what I did.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.468
I can't believe my dad's a hero.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.927
Oh, I'm no hero.

09:13.928 --> 09:17.097
I'm just a white guy doing what
black people were already doing.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.849
In other words, a hero.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.685
Well, can I just say,
as the famed family liberal,

09:21.686 --> 09:23.937
I think this activism is great, Peter.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.064
Doesn't matter if it's me or, say, you

09:26.065 --> 09:28.233
who gets applauded
for his progressive thinking,

09:28.234 --> 09:29.860
as long as the message is out there.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.153
Thank you, Brian.

09:31.154 --> 09:34.281
Wow. You-you are furious.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.575
Not at all. As long
as the message gets out there.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.619
I'm no different than my peers...
Rosa Parks,

09:38.620 --> 09:41.205
Nelson Mandela, Dr. Martin Luther King.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.081
Hey, did you ever notice
he has the names "Doc"

09:43.082 --> 09:44.374
and "Marty" in his name?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.543
- Let it go.
- Hello, Twitter.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.424
And I have to move out again.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.219
I don't know, Peter.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.887
This all seems weird.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.139
You never been interested
in these issues before.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.476
A-Are you sure you're not just
exploiting a real social issue

10:02.477 --> 10:04.853
so that people can call you a hero?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.980
- You heard Tom Tucker.
- I'm an activist now.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.440
I'm gonna go down in history,

10:08.441 --> 10:10.067
like my great-great-grandfather,

10:10.068 --> 10:12.778
John Wilkes Photo Booth Griffin.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.124
<i>We now return to</i> Seinfeld,

10:26.125 --> 10:29.962
<i>which keeps getting edited down
more and more for syndication.</i>

10:29.963 --> 10:32.172
<i>No soup for...</i>

10:32.173 --> 10:33.549
Funny show.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.760
Drinks are on me tonight,
thanks to your boy Peter.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.136
Wow. Thanks, Jerome.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.764
Well, thank <i> you</i>
for supporting the cause.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.183
Wow, people just give you things now?

10:43.184 --> 10:45.060
Yeah. Being an activist is great.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.271
I get all kinds of respect now.
Check it out.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.357
Here comes Cher to congratulate me.

10:50.942 --> 10:53.652
Peter, that's just a barstool
with a fur coat draped over it.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.945
Oh.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.532
Well, I see Robert De Niro
headed this way.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.827
That's a trash can
with a moldy pumpkin on top.

11:01.828 --> 11:05.540
Ah. Well, I definitely see
Michael Rapaport over there.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.294
That's someone's Boston Market
that fell on the floor.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.045
- Peter, you okay?
- Yeah, so many liberals

11:12.046 --> 11:14.798
patted me on the back today
that I lost my glasses.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.301
We're proud of you, Peter.

11:19.178 --> 11:22.390
In some comics, this means I'm sleeping.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.644
All right. In order to prove
I'm an activist,

11:27.645 --> 11:30.314
I need to yell at people
who are just trying to buy milk

11:30.315 --> 11:32.232
on their way home from work.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.026
Hello. Hi.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.319
Have a nice day.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.653
Hi there. Hello.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.655
Do you have a minute
to save a child's life?

11:38.656 --> 11:40.198
Yeah. I guess.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.242
You got a minute. Ticktock.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.577
What are you doing?

11:43.578 --> 11:44.870
30 seconds now.

11:44.871 --> 11:45.871
I'm listening.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.331
What am I even convincing you of?

11:47.332 --> 11:50.250
Tell me why Smokey the Bear
wears jeans but no shirt.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.460
Why would they do that?!

11:51.461 --> 11:55.173
- Is that what this is all about?
- That's what this is all about.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.179
Peter, what the hell?

12:02.180 --> 12:04.056
It's okay, it's okay.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.182
"I voted."

12:05.183 --> 12:07.059
So... yeah.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.061
- What does that matter?!
- Oh, well, I'm a part

12:09.062 --> 12:11.355
of the national conversation
now, and I voted.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.565
So my hands are kinda tied, so...

12:13.566 --> 12:14.775
yeah.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.360
You know what? This whole activism thing

12:16.361 --> 12:18.111
has gone on long enough.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.864
You knelt at <i> one</i> game.
It's not like opportunity's

12:20.865 --> 12:23.909
gonna come knocking on the door,
offering you money for it.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.205
Hi. I'm the president of Nike.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.456
How'd you like some money?

12:29.457 --> 12:31.208
For crying out loud!

12:31.209 --> 12:33.293
Mr. Griffin, we heard about your protest

12:33.294 --> 12:36.046
and we no-heartedly believe
that, with your help,

12:36.047 --> 12:39.466
we can conflate buying our
products with genuine activism.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.259
- I voted.
- Yes.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.428
And now we want to give you
a lot of money

12:43.429 --> 12:45.097
to star in a commercial for us.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.140
- What do you say?
- Well, I have two questions.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.393
- Will there be a stipend?
- Yes.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.436
Ah. And what is a stipend?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.230
It's a fee for being in the commercial.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.564
I'm in.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.151
<i>How do you know what's inside you</i>

12:58.152 --> 13:00.570
<i>unless you test yourself?</i>

13:00.571 --> 13:02.072
<i>Don't do</i> one <i> push-up,</i>

13:02.073 --> 13:03.782
<i>do 100.</i>

13:03.783 --> 13:05.701
<i>Don't run</i> one <i> mile,</i>

13:05.702 --> 13:07.786
<i>run a marathon.</i>

13:07.787 --> 13:09.329
<i>Don't have</i> one <i> family,</i>

13:09.330 --> 13:13.208
<i>have a second family
all the way across the country.</i>

13:13.209 --> 13:15.252
<i>Don't just have a</i> second <i> family,</i>

13:15.253 --> 13:19.298
<i>have a third family in Santa Fe
with an alternative lifestyle.</i>

13:20.591 --> 13:22.926
<i>Don't spend any time
with the first two families,</i>

13:22.927 --> 13:25.137
<i>make a commitment
to family number three,</i>

13:25.138 --> 13:27.139
<i>and double down by announcing it</i>

13:27.140 --> 13:29.350
<i>at his war-hero father's
retirement party.</i>

13:31.352 --> 13:33.645
<i>Don't go to the funeral,</i>

13:33.646 --> 13:36.023
<i>'cause, remember, you got
two other families to deal with</i>

13:36.024 --> 13:37.858
<i>and a marathon to train for.</i>

13:37.859 --> 13:40.861
<i>Don't just let Kenneth

13:40.862 --> 13:42.447
<i>take</i> his <i> life from him.</i>

13:43.406 --> 13:44.948
<i>Don't just go to jail,</i>

13:44.949 --> 13:47.909
<i>go to death row by killing
the two other families.</i>

13:47.910 --> 13:51.455
<i>Don't just let anyone have
their closure by apologizing,</i>

13:51.456 --> 13:54.124
<i>send a message that
you're not afraid of hell.</i>

(BLEEP)

13:57.962 --> 13:59.463
<i>Nike.</i>

13:59.464 --> 14:02.425
<i>You may not know this,
but our full name is Nichael.</i>

14:08.347 --> 14:09.973
Oh, my God! Peter Griffin!

14:09.974 --> 14:11.808
- Can I have your autograph?
- Sure.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.186
My friends are not
gonna believe I met you.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.645
'Cause I'm a known liar.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.523
- Okay.
- I love you. You're my hero.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.358
I can fly.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.196
Okay, I'm ready to move on
to the next person.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.198
Well, now I don't know what to believe.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.033
Carter. What are you doing here?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.993
Peter, ever since you made
that stupid commercial,

14:29.994 --> 14:31.828
my ticket sales have tanked!

14:31.829 --> 14:33.205
Thanks to you, people now think

14:33.206 --> 14:34.831
the Quahog Whooping Scalpers are racist!

14:34.832 --> 14:36.792
You want me to sign your boobs?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.169
Peter, your kneeling days are over.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.254
Two strikes, two outs,
bottom of the ninth,

14:41.255 --> 14:43.090
down by one, bases loaded,
Pewterschmidt up.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.050
Carter! Carter!

14:45.051 --> 14:47.052
He grounded out in the second,
struck out in the fifth.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.553
Hasn't been his day.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.180
Here's the wind-up, the pitch...

14:50.181 --> 14:52.182
Strike three! And he knew it.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.396
Aw. Cute.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.690
Look at the little birds.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.863
Oh. Disney's not gonna like that.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.411
Cleveland?

15:13.412 --> 15:15.789
Wha... Where am I?

15:15.790 --> 15:18.208
Welcome to WaQuahog.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.718
Oh, my God.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.846
Why wasn't <i> this The Cleveland Show?</i>

15:30.847 --> 15:34.892
This entire episode would have
been our season five premiere.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.570
What happened to me? Where am I?

15:46.571 --> 15:48.446
Have you ever seen <i>Black Panther?</i>

15:48.447 --> 15:50.157
No. No. God, no.

15:50.158 --> 15:53.118
Well, this is WaQuahog,
a secret part of Quahog

15:53.119 --> 15:56.079
with technology more advanced
than any nation.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.664
We brought you here to help you

15:57.665 --> 16:00.125
after you were attacked
for your activism.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.252
Really? So I'm the only white guy

16:02.253 --> 16:04.087
who knows WaQuahog exists?

16:04.088 --> 16:06.965
Well, you and one Postmates guy.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.925
Hey, I got your Taco Bell breakfast.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.302
Thanks.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.305
Oh. I don't, uh,
I don't see a soda with that.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.347
Oh, yeah, sorry.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.850
Um... do you want me to go back?

16:16.851 --> 16:18.852
Well, I mean... kinda.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.354
Okay, but since it's WaQuahog
it'll probably be, like,

16:21.355 --> 16:23.690
- 45 minutes, at least.
- Yeah. I mean,

16:23.691 --> 16:26.818
I ordered the soda
'cause I wanted the soda.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.445
Okay, man.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.198
- See you in, like, an hour.
- Right on.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.450
You better give him a big tip.

16:33.451 --> 16:37.162
Pretty sure the tip is already
built into the service charge.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.671
Wow! So this is, like, a secret kingdom

16:46.672 --> 16:48.381
cut off from the rest of the world?

16:48.382 --> 16:50.425
We got everything you need down here.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.802
Even our own WaQuahog TV channel.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.221
Oh,<i> The Jeffersons.</i>

16:54.222 --> 16:57.098
Yeah, but they edit
all the shows for syndication.

16:57.099 --> 17:01.896
<i>- Weezy...</i>
- ♪<i> Mmm... yeah.</i> ♪

17:06.733 --> 17:09.069
- Now LeBron's a Laker.
- A Laker's now LeBron.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.319
Yeah, that's not really working out,

17:10.320 --> 17:12.155
but thanks for having me here, guys.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.531
It is our pleasure.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.032
We want to thank you.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.577
By taking a knee, you showed the world

17:17.578 --> 17:20.997
that you see the terrible
injustices our people face.

17:20.998 --> 17:25.460
Of course, being an activist,
you already know all about them.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.795
Oh, boy.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.296
This is more uncomfortable

17:28.297 --> 17:30.882
than sports announcers
in a too-small booth.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.134
So, the Cowboys come in to today's game

17:33.135 --> 17:35.095
winners of four of their last five.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.972
So, Troy, what do they need to do

17:36.973 --> 17:38.640
to beat this Eagles team today?

17:38.641 --> 17:40.517
Well, Joe, you and I were talking

17:40.518 --> 17:42.936
over chopped liver
and coffee this morning,

17:42.937 --> 17:45.480
and we said it has to start
with the run game.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.982
I remember after that

17:46.983 --> 17:48.942
we Lady-and-the-Tramp'd
a croissant together

17:48.943 --> 17:51.695
and said this O-line needs
to get healthy.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.322
That's right, Joe.
And I hope the viewers out there

17:54.323 --> 17:57.158
can see by the fact that
our lips are almost touching

17:57.159 --> 17:59.995
that we are truly excited
about today's matchup.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.998
Straight from your mouth
into mine, partner.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.542
We do hope you'll join us in protest

18:05.543 --> 18:07.335
by kneeling at the next game.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.004
You bet I will!

18:09.005 --> 18:11.214
C-Can I, can I just ask
one question, though?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.882
What are Migos?

18:12.883 --> 18:17.762
Peter, everyone has to find out
what Migos are for themselves.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.561
A lot of eyes on you today, Griffin.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.646
I'm counting on you
to do the right thing.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.690
The only kneelin'
I want around here is Kevin.

18:28.691 --> 18:29.816
Hey, Mr. Pewterschmidt...

18:29.817 --> 18:31.568
Front row seats... thanks
for having me at the game.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.903
Pleased to meet you, Kevin.
I've got some seats for you

18:33.904 --> 18:35.655
- in the front row.
- Oh, great! Thanks!

18:35.656 --> 18:37.324
- Line of coke. Lead the way.
- Sure.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.659
Hey, what do you say
we take a pit stop in the...

18:39.660 --> 18:41.119
little boys' room.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.122
<i>And now,
please rise for our national anthem</i>

18:44.123 --> 18:45.957
<i>to be sung by Kevin Nealon.</i>

18:45.958 --> 18:48.918
<i>And I have no idea
how he convinced me of that.</i>

18:48.919 --> 18:51.297
<i>I thought we were just talking
about other things.</i>

18:54.258 --> 18:57.010
Oh, man. I don't know what to do.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.887
Kneel with us, brother.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.181
Whoa!

19:01.182 --> 19:03.391
That is good bathroom cocaine.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.976
Somebody's in this stall!

19:04.977 --> 19:06.020
That's it!

19:06.979 --> 19:08.313
Hey, listen up, everyone.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.315
I have something
I need to come clean about.

19:12.026 --> 19:14.903
Cleveland, people of WaQuahog,

19:14.904 --> 19:18.239
I didn't kneel during the anthem
because I was an activist.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.825
I kneeled because I had
fairly brutal diarrhea,

19:20.826 --> 19:22.369
and I'm sorry.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.871
If I could take it back,
I would still kneel,

19:24.872 --> 19:26.915
but for the right reasons now.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.625
I see the struggle you face,

19:28.626 --> 19:30.711
and you deserve everyone's support.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.506
And, Carter, I know you're
just trying to honor the troops.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.424
- I never said that.
- But, honestly,

19:36.425 --> 19:38.218
why are we even playing
the national anthem

19:38.219 --> 19:39.636
at a sports event?

19:39.637 --> 19:42.430
It's not a solemn occasion,
like a military funeral

19:42.431 --> 19:45.392
or, or sex between Salma Hayek
and Ed Norton.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.393
It's a game.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.228
The problem isn't with each other,

19:48.229 --> 19:49.562
it's with the song.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.565
We need a new song,
one that unites all people.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.068
Why is your phone all pink and sparkly?

19:55.069 --> 19:57.195
- You're talking about it, aren't you?
- Oh, snap.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.366
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
your new national anthem.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.591
♪ <i>Yeehaw!</i> ♪

20:18.592 --> 20:19.801
♪ <i>Here we go</i> ♪

20:21.178 --> 20:22.804
I'm making my way to the bathroom.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.682
I have to poop again.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.106
Well, I'm glad
all that controversy is over

20:33.107 --> 20:34.774
and we got our old Peter back.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.359
But I kinda miss Meg.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.112
Oh, yeah, that's right.
She got traded to <i> American Dad.</i>

20:39.113 --> 20:41.448
I hear she's doing great.

Oh. So it's just gonna be the same?

20:58.299 --> 20:59.382
Yup.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.968
Yeah.
