01:24.210 --> 01:26.652
We are at the Boryspil Airport in Kiev,

01:26.654 --> 01:29.121
and this is the first chapter
of our documentary

01:29.123 --> 01:32.024
<i>entitled Cannibals
of the 20th Century.</i>

01:32.026 --> 01:34.326
In 1932 and 1933,

01:34.328 --> 01:36.428
Ukraine suffered
a terrible famine,

01:36.430 --> 01:39.331
which led many people
to resort to cannibalism.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.233
We'll be interviewing
famine survivors,

01:41.235 --> 01:43.268
but we're here mainly
because of Boris Glaskov,

01:43.270 --> 01:44.570
charged with cannibalism,

01:44.572 --> 01:46.271
who decided
to speak about it openly.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.707
It'll be
a cannibal's confession.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.242
Oh, you think that's too much?

01:50.244 --> 01:52.144
No, no, no.
I think it's good.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.613
I think we need to keep
constantly shocking the viewer.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.915
I mean, if it's too much,
we can edit it out later, right?

01:56.917 --> 01:57.916
Okay, yeah.

01:57.918 --> 02:00.219
[laughs]
How do you do?

02:00.221 --> 02:02.087
How do you do, my friend?

02:02.089 --> 02:04.323
- Hello!
- My friend.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.457
Good to see you.

02:10.830 --> 02:14.900
We have to go because we have
a lot of things to do today.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.069
Dobri den.
My name's Ethan.

02:17.071 --> 02:19.838
Oh, hello,
my name is Katarina.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.673
Nice to meet you.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.511
- Please, please, let me.
- I'll take these.

02:25.513 --> 02:29.581
I'll take that.
I'll get that one.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.319
You're such a gentleman.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.189
- We should be square.
- Good, good.

02:37.191 --> 02:41.927
[speaking Ukrainian]

02:41.929 --> 02:44.229
Ah, it's all good.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.965
[dog barking]

02:51.404 --> 02:53.639
How old was she
during the famine?

02:53.641 --> 02:58.410
[speaking Ukrainian]

02:58.412 --> 02:59.678
She was 13.

03:04.784 --> 03:10.222
[speaking Ukrainian]

03:10.224 --> 03:13.525
She heard that after the war,

03:13.527 --> 03:16.261
they made cutlets
out of human flesh,

03:16.263 --> 03:19.231
and they just sold them.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.366
- They sold them?
- Yeah.

03:22.535 --> 03:28.040
[speaking Ukrainian]

03:39.485 --> 03:41.553
So we're in
the Ukrainian National Library,

03:41.555 --> 03:44.723
where we'll be meeting
with Professor Dmitri Antonov,

03:44.725 --> 03:48.860
who studies the causes and
consequences of cannibalism.

03:48.862 --> 03:56.335
[speaking Ukrainian]

04:20.326 --> 04:24.263
[Valeriy speaking Ukrainian]

04:26.799 --> 04:29.868
Now, how long has Boris Glaskov
worked for you?

04:29.870 --> 04:33.672
[speaking Ukrainian]

04:35.408 --> 04:38.243
Around 15 years,
since he got out of prison.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.312
Boris Glaskov was
accused of murdering

04:40.314 --> 04:42.514
his colleague
from the university,

04:42.516 --> 04:43.749
Tolja Kovalenko,

04:43.751 --> 04:46.251
but they never found
Tolja's body,

04:46.253 --> 04:48.787
and eventually they had
to let Boris go.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.256
But there are dozens
of other people in this area

04:51.258 --> 04:52.791
that disappeared mysteriously.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.793
Do you think there's
any connection with them?

05:04.604 --> 05:05.804
Katarina.

05:07.106 --> 05:09.107
Valeriy says he's just
making an excuse

05:09.109 --> 05:10.909
for not being able to visit.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.277
He just wants more money.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.845
How much more does he want?

05:13.847 --> 05:16.581
[speaking Ukrainian]

05:16.583 --> 05:20.118
Another thousand dollars,
and he wants an advance.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.756
- Can't afford it.
- I know.

05:24.758 --> 05:28.527
Look, I'll figure it out.
I'll make it work, okay?

05:28.529 --> 05:31.830
- We don't have a choice.
- We don't have the money.

05:31.832 --> 05:35.267
We came here because of him,
all right? We need him.

05:35.269 --> 05:36.601
I'll make it work.

05:41.207 --> 05:42.474
[speaking Ukrainian]

05:42.476 --> 05:44.509
Okay, it's turned off.

05:57.857 --> 06:01.860
[speaking Ukrainian]

06:34.460 --> 06:37.829
- Oh!
- Katarina, are you okay?

06:37.831 --> 06:39.631
Yes.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.802
Does Boris agree?

06:43.804 --> 06:47.372
I guess he's giving us
the keys for the house.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.239
- Ugh. He's hideous.
- Yeah.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.108
- So, Ryan?
- Yeah?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.010
- Boris just gave you the keys?
- Yeah.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.446
Don't you think
that's a little strange?

07:27.448 --> 07:29.481
Actually, he gave the keys
to Katarina,

07:29.483 --> 07:30.982
so you might wanna
look out for her.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.185
You don't want him
to eat your girlfriend.

07:33.187 --> 07:34.820
Aw, that's real cute.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.055
Seriously,
you should go with her.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.591
She looks really upset.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.593
All right, if we got the keys,
let's go.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.495
All right, let's go, yeah.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.700
[speaking Ukrainian]

07:56.542 --> 08:00.579
Um, this is Inna,
and she's local...

08:00.581 --> 08:01.713
witch.

08:01.715 --> 08:05.250
Yeah, and she can go with us
to help us.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.853
I'm sorry, and how is a witch
supposed to help us?

08:07.855 --> 08:10.288
People here
are a bit different,

08:10.290 --> 08:11.857
and they're afraid
of strangers,

08:11.859 --> 08:14.226
and they might not want
to talk to you,

08:14.228 --> 08:17.329
but they will definitely
talk to Inna.

08:19.398 --> 08:21.299
Well, it can't hurt, right?

08:21.301 --> 08:22.534
- Sure.
- Okay.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.049
[branches scraping van]

08:41.721 --> 08:43.822
Ryan, I don't think
this is a good idea.

08:43.823 --> 08:47.192
- We're gonna get stuck.
- It's scratching the car bad.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.394
Whoa. Look at that.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.497
Whoa! Stop.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.903
It looks like something's
blocking the road.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.504
[speaking Ukrainian]

09:01.574 --> 09:04.042
[speaking Ukrainian]

09:04.044 --> 09:06.044
- Let's go.
- Okay.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.048
Up.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.850
[speaking Ukrainian]

09:12.919 --> 09:15.020
So the house
is about an hour away

09:15.022 --> 09:19.491
from the sawmill in the village,
in the middle of the woods.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.798
All right, this is the house.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.169
[speaking Ukrainian]

09:31.171 --> 09:33.438
So this is the house
where we'll be interviewing

09:33.440 --> 09:35.307
Boris Glaskov today.

09:35.309 --> 09:39.010
And hopefully find out a bit
more about what happened here.

09:39.012 --> 09:42.247
Boris Glaskov was accused
of murdering his colleague.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.049
Now, they never
found the body,

09:44.051 --> 09:46.851
but when Boris is under hypnosis
with Professor Anatov,

09:46.853 --> 09:48.787
he actually confessed
to the murder,

09:48.789 --> 09:51.957
and he claimed that he was
being forced to eat the body.

09:51.959 --> 09:56.394
If that's true, who or what was
forcing him to do that and why?

09:59.231 --> 10:01.166
Oh!

10:02.168 --> 10:03.902
Oh, wow.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.747
It's actually
really pretty out here.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.248
- What is this?
- It's so we can see the shot.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.118
- This is good.
- Here we go.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.053
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey!

10:22.055 --> 10:23.955
Hey, Dad.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.658
Never thought I'd do it, huh?

10:26.660 --> 10:30.595
- Thanks for doing this with me.
- You're welcome.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.164
- You're awesome.
- Thanks.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.302
- It's a little bit, uh...
- A little dusty?

10:37.304 --> 10:40.438
It is. I don't know
why it's in the bedroom,

10:40.440 --> 10:43.108
but, uh, here it is.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.345
Oh, dude, there's like a...

10:47.347 --> 10:50.348
an attic or something
up there.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.951
Hey, Jenny,
give me the camera.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.694
- You see anything up there?
- Naw.

11:05.231 --> 11:08.199
[distant chatter]

11:10.936 --> 11:13.972
- Oh, fuck!
- What? What?

11:16.175 --> 11:17.942
- Oh, shit.
- What?

11:17.944 --> 11:21.146
Boris must have left his shoes
up here. They freaked me out.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.148
Dude, what,
are you trying to scare me?

11:23.150 --> 11:24.582
Ah, fuck!

11:24.584 --> 11:27.218
Oh, there's tons of light
in this room.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.158
What's for dinner?

11:33.160 --> 11:36.695
Some garlic and fly larva.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.998
Garlic and flies
for dinner tonight.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.299
For a family.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.703
This must've been what they ate
during the famine.

11:44.705 --> 11:48.273
Oh, shit.
Not very funny, huh?

11:48.275 --> 11:49.441
Sorry. I'm a dick.

11:49.443 --> 11:53.178
- Should work.
- Nice!

11:53.180 --> 11:54.746
Good job, man.

11:54.748 --> 11:59.250
And we also decided to install
some backup cameras,

11:59.252 --> 12:01.419
our reliable 2D backup.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.555
Uh-huh.
It's like Big Brother.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.857
That's how we roll.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.892
It might be a little high
on the left,

12:07.894 --> 12:10.261
but we'll have to adjust it
when he gets here.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.262
Okay.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.268
So Valeriy's psychic...

12:17.270 --> 12:20.672
Doesn't seem like she wants
to come in the house.

12:20.674 --> 12:24.876
That's strange. She hasn't even
spoken since we got in the car.

12:25.845 --> 12:28.480
Valeriy kindly asks you

12:28.482 --> 12:32.083
if you can give some money
in advance for three of us

12:32.085 --> 12:34.953
- for tomorrow.
- The three of you?

12:34.955 --> 12:36.588
I mean, I--

12:36.590 --> 12:41.192
We only have money
for you and Valeriy.

12:41.194 --> 12:45.296
Here. I'll give you the advance
for you and Katarina,

12:45.298 --> 12:48.633
and then, um, you know,
after we are done,

12:48.635 --> 12:50.435
completely wrapped
with filming,

12:50.437 --> 12:54.439
I'll try to see if I could
work out something for Inna.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.175
We'll just have to see
how much money I have after.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.243
I see.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.912
So it is 8:00,

13:00.914 --> 13:03.081
and Boris has not arrived.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.817
Probably isn't gonna arrive.

13:05.819 --> 13:09.120
So Valeriy's been trying
to call him in the village,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.990
but hasn't been able
to get ahold of anybody.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.225
We've got food,
we've got drinks

13:14.227 --> 13:16.227
and enough oil to keep
the generator running,

13:16.229 --> 13:18.830
so we decided to stay here
for the night.

13:18.832 --> 13:22.300
No. You decided to stay.
Not everyone agrees.

13:37.349 --> 13:40.685
I talked to Ryan. We don't have
to stay here for the night.

13:40.687 --> 13:43.154
We could find a hotel.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.658
No. We just trying to arrange
who sleeps where.

13:47.459 --> 13:50.061
[speaking Ukrainian]

13:52.264 --> 13:54.632
He can arrange anything.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.001
[speaking Ukrainian]

14:04.243 --> 14:07.779
Would you like to hunt a deer
with a machine gun?

14:07.781 --> 14:10.815
[speaking Ukrainian]

14:17.623 --> 14:20.825
Or go fishing with a grenade?

14:23.162 --> 14:26.364
What about the Russian
boot dance they do?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.867
Doesn't every Russian
do the...

14:30.736 --> 14:33.104
I wanna see that.
Let's see that.

14:50.990 --> 14:54.692
So according to
our guide Valeriy--

14:54.694 --> 14:58.363
There's Valeriy
making a fire for us.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.765
This is the table where
Boris and his colleague

15:00.767 --> 15:02.333
invoked the spirits.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.302
The spirit told him
that somebody killed

15:04.304 --> 15:07.939
and ate a little boy
right here on this table.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.941
So let's clear off the table,

15:09.943 --> 15:14.812
and let's do our own
little invocation, huh?

15:14.814 --> 15:16.814
Inna is going to show us

15:16.816 --> 15:19.450
the ancient technique
of invoking spirits.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.919
Table.

15:22.855 --> 15:26.591
- What is that?
- Whoa!

15:26.593 --> 15:28.893
Yeah, that's creepy.

15:28.895 --> 15:31.029
- That's insane.
- That's cool.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.964
I mean, I guess it's convenient.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.699
They didn't have to leave
the table after dinner,

15:34.701 --> 15:37.001
and they just
flip over a glass

15:37.003 --> 15:39.003
and invoke some spirits
or something.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.439
They have such normal evenings
in Ukraine, don't they?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.675
Different country,
different habits, I guess. Jeez.

15:43.677 --> 15:47.145
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

15:47.147 --> 15:48.413
Guys...

15:48.415 --> 15:50.615
Hi. I'm here.
I'm a ghost.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.550
Hi.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.218
No, it say no.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.254
It's yes and no.
And this is also--

15:56.256 --> 15:58.957
Thank God we have
a translator here.

16:00.192 --> 16:02.727
- What's wrong?
- No, it's okay.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.563
Inna says this is not the right
time to do this right now.

16:05.565 --> 16:09.534
Maybe we can do it tomorrow
because today is bad day.

16:09.536 --> 16:12.804
[speaking Ukrainian]

16:12.806 --> 16:15.473
Ah!
[humming Russian tune]

16:15.475 --> 16:18.042
[Jenny laughing]

16:20.512 --> 16:24.582
See, I told you every Russian
can do that.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.352
Why don't we interview Tolja,
you know?

16:27.354 --> 16:28.820
Boris never showed up.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.521
We need to interview someone,
right?

16:30.523 --> 16:32.390
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let's interview him.

16:32.392 --> 16:35.059
- Let's find out who ate him.
- Ah!

16:35.061 --> 16:37.562
No, really,
it's a bad day today.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.298
- I would not want to do this.
- Come on!

16:40.300 --> 16:42.367
You don't want
to translate for us?

16:50.175 --> 16:54.946
Hey, put both of them on there
or it doesn't work.

16:54.948 --> 16:57.248
- Oh, my God.
- That's the rules.

16:57.250 --> 17:02.920
You are the sexiest
translator ever.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.823
You're the sexiest
ghost translator

17:05.825 --> 17:07.759
I have ever seen in my life.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.527
Put it on, put it on.
All right.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.864
Concentrate. Ohh!

17:12.866 --> 17:15.500
Tolja's on 'cause it'd be
somebody who's been eaten.

17:15.502 --> 17:19.436
I guess he hasn't talked
to anybody in a long time.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.105
Whoa!

17:21.107 --> 17:24.409
Okay, seriously,
seriously this time.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.477
Seriously. Shh!

17:26.479 --> 17:31.516
Our entire documentary depends,
depends on this.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.419
Right, right, so then I've got
the first question.

17:34.421 --> 17:38.322
All right.
Now, when they ate you,

17:38.324 --> 17:41.926
did they eat you raw
or did they deep-fry your ass?

17:41.928 --> 17:46.631
[laughter]

18:07.486 --> 18:09.787
Hey, Ethan.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.522
Ethan.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.258
Dude, wake up.

18:14.260 --> 18:18.029
Hey, hey.

18:18.031 --> 18:21.065
Dude, good job.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.670
Oh, man.

18:25.672 --> 18:26.971
What?

18:36.381 --> 18:37.215
Hey.

18:37.217 --> 18:41.185
[speaking Ukrainian]

18:49.561 --> 18:52.063
So wait a second.

18:52.065 --> 18:57.668
So Inna is saying
that Valeriy is dead?

18:57.670 --> 19:00.371
That is a great way
to start the morning.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.274
She saying that Valeriy
is not going to come back

19:03.276 --> 19:04.842
because he's dead.

19:04.844 --> 19:08.646
He was killed by the spirit
that we awoke last night.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.048
We must recall the spirit,

19:11.050 --> 19:14.952
otherwise no one can
leave this place.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.321
And we definitely cannot
flip over the glass

19:17.323 --> 19:19.157
because one of us will die.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.792
Would you just stop with
the ghost stories already?

19:21.794 --> 19:24.862
I mean, we heard enough
from Valeriy last night, okay?

19:24.864 --> 19:27.498
All right, listen,
everything's gonna be fine.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.133
Let me try calling
Valeriy again

19:29.135 --> 19:32.103
and see if I can
get ahold of him, okay?

19:36.942 --> 19:40.745
[speaking Ukrainian]

19:46.485 --> 19:49.487
Valeriy's not picking up.
It's his voicemail.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.522
You know what?
I'm gonna have some vodka.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.991
[shouting]

20:00.232 --> 20:03.000
- What?
- You can't touch the glass,

20:03.002 --> 20:05.169
and she was saying
that your elder brother

20:05.171 --> 20:07.638
wouldn't be so stupid.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.843
How does she know about
my older brother?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.512
[speaking Ukrainian]

20:16.648 --> 20:19.350
You're fucking crazy.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.852
Fine, I won't touch
the glass, okay?

20:21.854 --> 20:23.821
No touch.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.656
Happy?

20:30.596 --> 20:34.932
So he's gonna charge us
$800 for a cab? He's nuts.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.268
That's more expensive than
London. That's ridiculous.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.704
Yes, but it's hundred kilometers
from Charkoc,

20:39.706 --> 20:41.339
which is the closest we can get.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.808
And as well, he wants
half of his money in advance,

20:43.810 --> 20:45.810
so he wouldn't come here
empty-handed.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.346
Well, of course he does.
He probably thinks it's a joke.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.414
Not many people book cabs
from the middle of the woods.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.650
How do we know he's not just
gonna take the money and run

20:52.652 --> 20:54.385
like Valeriy did?

20:54.387 --> 20:57.321
Maybe I can ask
my friend Sasha from Kiev.

20:57.323 --> 21:00.057
Maybe we will pay him for
the gas, and he will come here.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.193
It's like 400 kilometers.

21:02.195 --> 21:03.261
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.329
Right, Ryan? That's good.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.365
Sure. Can you call him?

21:07.367 --> 21:08.799
Yup.

21:10.869 --> 21:13.170
[meowing]

21:22.014 --> 21:24.749
[screech, hiss]

21:24.751 --> 21:26.550
Okay, he can make it today,

21:26.552 --> 21:29.253
but he can be here tomorrow
by the afternoon.

21:29.255 --> 21:32.690
Tomorrow? Shit.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.458
I mean, what else
are we gonna do?

21:34.460 --> 21:36.794
Maybe Boris and Valeriy
will come back by then.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.796
What?

21:38.798 --> 21:41.899
What else are we gonna do?
I don't know.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.834
Oh, God.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.971
When we get into the house,
I want you to interview Inna.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.472
- Why?
- I don't know.

21:48.474 --> 21:49.740
We could do something
about, like,

21:49.742 --> 21:51.709
Ukrainian culture
and superstition.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.244
- It might be good.
- That's ridiculous.

21:53.246 --> 21:56.681
She's a complete
crazy person. Uhh!

21:56.683 --> 21:59.083
So here are the marks
from the tires

21:59.085 --> 22:02.219
where Valeriy must have left.

22:04.589 --> 22:08.092
We came here to shoot a pilot
for a documentary series

22:08.094 --> 22:10.428
about cannibals
of the 20th century,

22:10.430 --> 22:15.733
hoping that the funding could
get us all over the world.

22:15.735 --> 22:18.436
As of now, we have shit.

22:18.438 --> 22:21.005
And if it keeps going this way,

22:21.007 --> 22:24.709
it's gonna end up on YouTube
like all my other crap.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.944
Fuck.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.646
So here in Ukraine,

22:28.648 --> 22:31.982
a lot of people
are very superstitious still,

22:31.984 --> 22:33.517
and they believe in psychics.

22:33.519 --> 22:36.587
And we actually have
one of them here, Inna,

22:36.589 --> 22:39.190
who believes
that we are trapped here

22:39.192 --> 22:42.159
by some sort of evil ghost
or spirit, isn't that right?

22:42.161 --> 22:45.196
You think there is
an evil spirit or ghost

22:45.198 --> 22:47.198
in the room with us?

22:47.200 --> 22:50.634
[speaking Ukrainian]

23:00.679 --> 23:04.949
She was saying that you just
continue making your movie,

23:04.951 --> 23:07.118
but you have to listen to her.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.221
And the spirit we invoked
last night is still here,

23:10.223 --> 23:11.622
and we have to get rid of him,

23:11.624 --> 23:14.425
otherwise we will
all be trapped here.

23:14.427 --> 23:17.962
Okay. And now why
should we believe you?

23:17.964 --> 23:20.564
I mean, me, for instance,
I don't believe in ghosts.

23:20.566 --> 23:23.067
I just think that
the dead are dead,

23:23.069 --> 23:25.469
and they can't hurt anyone.

23:25.471 --> 23:27.037
[speaking Ukrainian]

23:27.039 --> 23:29.473
Some of them can hurt you.

23:29.475 --> 23:31.876
What does she mean?

23:31.878 --> 23:34.345
[speaking Ukrainian]

23:41.286 --> 23:45.823
You wouldn't understand
because you think she's crazy.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.826
Well, why don't you
just convince me?

23:48.828 --> 23:50.361
I'm listening.

23:50.363 --> 23:53.697
[speaking Ukrainian]

24:01.873 --> 24:05.743
Inna says that, um...

24:05.745 --> 24:08.946
you are not able
to have children,

24:08.948 --> 24:13.951
and that you don't want to have
anyone to know about this.

24:17.756 --> 24:19.323
Uh...

24:19.325 --> 24:23.360
Okay, and how do you
know about that?

24:23.362 --> 24:24.895
[speaking Ukrainian]

24:30.836 --> 24:34.238
Is that true?
How did she know that?

24:34.240 --> 24:39.109
Uh, I have no idea.

24:39.111 --> 24:43.848
I only found that out last week.
I don't want Ryan to know yet.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.684
I just haven't--

24:46.686 --> 24:48.953
It hasn't been the right time
to tell him, okay?

24:48.955 --> 24:51.155
So can you just, um--

24:51.157 --> 24:54.058
Can you erase that tape,
please?

24:54.060 --> 24:57.361
Yeah, sure.
Are you okay?

24:59.998 --> 25:02.166
So none of that stuff from Inna
was any good, huh?

25:02.168 --> 25:05.636
No, no, no, it was...
She's just a fake, you know?

25:05.638 --> 25:07.304
It doesn't make any sense.

25:07.306 --> 25:08.873
Maybe we could do it again.

25:08.875 --> 25:12.109
No, I don't think there's
a point doing it again.

25:12.111 --> 25:14.645
Ah, I can't tie this.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.881
- Guys, you gotta come in here.
- What's he talking about?

25:16.883 --> 25:19.283
- You gotta watch this!
- Let's go check it out.

25:19.285 --> 25:22.019
Ryan, you weren't shooting in
the attic last night, were you?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.954
- No. Why?
- Look at this.

25:23.956 --> 25:27.491
Well, somebody must have
shot it on the camera.

26:10.302 --> 26:14.171
Look, I know that you're trying
to make things more interesting,

26:14.173 --> 26:15.539
but I'm not buying it.

26:15.541 --> 26:18.576
Jenny, I said it wasn't me,
all right?

26:18.578 --> 26:20.411
I can go with you,
if you want.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.146
No, it's fine.

26:32.357 --> 26:36.393
This is weird. Hey, guys,
the jacket and boots are gone.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.462
Be careful.
Boris might get you.

Valeriy.
Valeriy was in charge of that.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.928
That like a ghost
turned them off or something?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.930
That's ridiculous.

30:32.932 --> 30:36.366
No, I'm saying
it's kinda weird.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.335
It's strange.

30:38.337 --> 30:41.905
Between, you know, the curse,
Valeriy missing, and the ghost,

30:41.907 --> 30:44.141
we might have something in here.

30:44.143 --> 30:47.110
Okay, and how long
do you want to wait around

30:47.112 --> 30:49.046
for this imaginary ghost
of yours then?

30:49.048 --> 30:51.615
I don't want to wait.
I wanna give Inna a shot.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.217
[scoffs]

30:53.219 --> 30:57.454
Ethan, I want you to set up
the other cameras in the rooms.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.157
Wait, so now we're gonna be
spying on ourselves?

31:00.159 --> 31:02.960
No, not spying.
Look, I just--

31:02.962 --> 31:05.696
You gotta just trust me
on this, okay?

31:05.698 --> 31:07.531
Everything's gonna be okay.

31:07.533 --> 31:11.268
- Come here and give me a kiss.
- No, give me a break.

31:12.971 --> 31:15.973
Come on, you guys, you gotta
start looking at the situation

31:15.975 --> 31:17.608
a little differently,

31:17.610 --> 31:20.744
or we are gonna go home
with shit.

31:21.679 --> 31:23.881
This house has a dark history.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.250
After the famine, a little boy
was eaten in this house,

31:26.252 --> 31:28.986
and several years ago,
Boris supposedly killed

31:28.988 --> 31:31.555
and ate his colleague
at the same place.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.056
They were invoking spirits

31:33.058 --> 31:35.425
at the same table
we did last night.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.394
And Boris is the only person
that knows

31:37.396 --> 31:39.630
what really happened afterwards.

31:39.632 --> 31:44.468
He promised to tell us
everything, but never showed up.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.837
We've decided to do the
invocation ourselves,

31:46.839 --> 31:50.307
and see if we can
figure anything out.

31:53.611 --> 31:55.312
Hey.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.648
It's pretty dark out there
right now.

31:57.650 --> 32:01.485
You guys ready to, uh,
do this?

32:01.487 --> 32:03.020
Yes.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.988
How's it going, man? You almost
set up with the camera?

32:04.990 --> 32:06.690
- Yup.
- Sweet.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.926
You guys ready to go?

32:11.062 --> 32:14.398
All right,
let's invoke some spirits.

32:17.035 --> 32:21.538
[speaking Ukrainian]

32:21.540 --> 32:25.242
Inna says that you, Jennifer,
shouldn't push the glass.

32:25.244 --> 32:28.111
It takes some time for the
spirit to connect with us.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.746
Were you really doing it?

32:29.748 --> 32:32.249
Yeah, I just wanted to see if
you could see it on the camera.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.318
All right, just don't do it
again, okay?

32:47.765 --> 32:49.566
Katarina...

32:49.568 --> 32:53.971
[speaking Ukrainian]

32:53.973 --> 32:58.475
Ethan, Inna says you should
touch my shoulder.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.844
You could've been involved
in the séance,

33:00.846 --> 33:03.347
and the spirit wants
all of us.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.948
Okay.

33:08.753 --> 33:11.021
It says yes.

33:11.023 --> 33:13.390
[speaking Ukrainian]

33:13.392 --> 33:17.127
Who was asking
if the ghost is here?

33:17.129 --> 33:19.229
I did.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.864
I-- I was.

33:20.866 --> 33:24.601
[speaking Ukrainian]

33:24.603 --> 33:29.606
Wait, I wanna talk to him.
Can I ask him a question?

33:29.608 --> 33:31.908
He says yes.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.543
- Oh, shit!
- What was that?

33:33.545 --> 33:37.080
- The generator shut down.
- What do you mean?

33:37.082 --> 33:39.549
- Lights out?
- All right, I'll go check.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.952
[glass sliding on table]

33:41.954 --> 33:44.287
What is that?

33:44.289 --> 33:47.290
Ethan, get the camera out.
Get the light on the camera on.

33:47.292 --> 33:49.126
- I'm trying, I'm trying.
- Come on!

33:49.128 --> 33:52.062
I'm trying to, dammit!

33:52.064 --> 33:55.399
- Whoa!
- What the fuck was that?

33:56.567 --> 33:58.969
[speaking Ukrainian]

33:58.971 --> 34:01.438
She says "barn dig center."

34:01.440 --> 34:05.976
What barn dig?
What does that mean?

34:05.978 --> 34:09.846
[speaking Ukrainian]

34:09.848 --> 34:11.481
The spirit wants us
to dig for something

34:11.483 --> 34:13.116
in the middle of the barn.

34:13.118 --> 34:14.918
How does she know
what that board--

34:14.920 --> 34:16.753
Because she was moving
the fucking glass!

34:16.755 --> 34:19.356
- Why won't you believe her?
- Everyone just relax.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.291
It's probably just
the gas in the generator.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.025
I'll go out there
and fix it.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.728
Wait, you shouldn't
go out there alone.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.431
There could be
someone out there.

34:27.433 --> 34:28.598
Well, then come with me.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.600
You have to take some
open fires with you,

34:30.601 --> 34:32.668
like a candle to protect you.

34:32.670 --> 34:36.273
You know what? If it's Boris
or Valeriy, this will do.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.942
- Come on.
- All right, all right.

34:38.944 --> 34:41.645
Keep the camera on.
Let's go. Give me light.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.179
Give me some light.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.782
This is fucking stupid, dude.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.385
- This is not--
- Is anyone there?

34:48.387 --> 34:51.554
No, no, no, dude,
this is not good.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.523
Hello!

34:53.525 --> 34:54.891
Ryan. Ryan!

34:54.893 --> 34:57.327
Shut the fuck up.
Just give me some light.

34:57.329 --> 35:00.363
Come on, man,
let's go back inside.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.299
Light in there.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.703
This is not good.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.772
I need some more light.
Come on.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.007
- Shit. What the fuck was that?
- What the fuck, man?

35:11.009 --> 35:12.209
There something--
I just heard something.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.111
Ethan, come on.
Give me some light.

35:14.113 --> 35:17.481
Let's get this fucking
generator on. Let's go!

35:17.483 --> 35:20.383
- Nothing's there.
- Yes.

35:24.322 --> 35:26.089
Fuck!

35:26.091 --> 35:28.658
What the fuck? Shit!

35:28.660 --> 35:30.760
What the fuck!

35:30.762 --> 35:32.195
Are you all right?

35:32.197 --> 35:34.531
- Something's happening.
- Come on, get up.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.099
I'm telling you, man,
someone's out there.

35:36.101 --> 35:38.201
You okay? Fuck, come on!

35:38.203 --> 35:40.403
Get the light
out of my fucking face.

35:40.405 --> 35:42.472
Look, nothing's here, man.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.280
JENNY: Don't you think
this is a bit drastic?

35:50.282 --> 35:51.615
Inna just says one thing,

35:51.617 --> 35:55.118
and you go digging
in the fucking barn.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.092
Shh, shh, shh.

36:02.094 --> 36:03.793
Did you guys hear that?

36:03.795 --> 36:05.529
What?

36:05.531 --> 36:08.498
Sounds like the same noise
I heard earlier outside.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.599
What?

36:12.870 --> 36:14.204
I don't hear anything.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.705
God, would you stop
trying to scare me?

36:15.707 --> 36:17.641
Okay, I've had enough.

36:22.446 --> 36:24.581
Hey, it's that case
from the attic.

36:24.583 --> 36:27.217
This is a weird game.

36:27.219 --> 36:29.853
Who buried this case
in the barn?

36:29.855 --> 36:34.024
I found some photographs, an old
camera, and some tapes in it.

36:35.626 --> 36:37.460
How's it going, man?

36:37.462 --> 36:40.597
I'm looking for the wire.

36:40.599 --> 36:45.635
All right, so Ethan was able
to get the tapes hooked up.

36:45.637 --> 36:48.939
The first one
appeared to be erased.

36:48.941 --> 36:51.174
There was only
a whispering sound.

36:51.176 --> 36:53.376
But the second one here
we have set up.

36:53.378 --> 36:56.713
He's got quite the screening
for us tonight.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.216
All right, man,
let's get it started.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.190
Is that Boris?

37:07.192 --> 37:09.626
Yeah, in this room.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.635
<i>[Boris speaking Ukrainian]</i>

37:18.637 --> 37:20.103
Why are you filming me?

37:20.105 --> 37:22.539
<i>[Tolja speaking Ukrainian]</i>

37:22.541 --> 37:24.307
We have to do
what the spirit wants.

37:24.309 --> 37:27.577
It's the only way
we can get out of here.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.647
"1995."

37:30.649 --> 37:34.150
That's right before he was
arrested for cannibalism.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.724
<i>[Tolja shouting]</i>

37:40.726 --> 37:42.926
Hurry up. Do it.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.494
<i>[shouting]</i>

37:44.496 --> 37:47.063
Do it.
What are you waiting for?

37:54.905 --> 37:57.774
What is he doing?

37:57.776 --> 37:59.142
What the--

37:59.144 --> 38:01.678
Why is he doing that?

38:04.482 --> 38:06.249
Oh, my God.

38:11.422 --> 38:15.592
<i>Boris? Boris...
[speaking Ukrainian]</i>

38:15.594 --> 38:17.327
<i>[growls]</i>

38:17.329 --> 38:21.431
<i>[screaming]</i>

38:21.433 --> 38:23.967
He's killing him!
He's killing him!

38:23.969 --> 38:27.103
<i>- [chomping]
- Oh, God.</i>

38:28.739 --> 38:30.173
Oh, my God.

38:30.175 --> 38:31.508
[screech]

38:31.510 --> 38:33.276
That sounded like
it came from outside.

38:33.278 --> 38:34.711
Was that the same sound
as the video?

38:34.713 --> 38:36.780
Yes.

38:36.782 --> 38:39.582
I'm sure, man.
That was the same--

38:39.584 --> 38:40.950
Jesus!

38:40.952 --> 38:42.619
Shit!
Someone shut us down.

38:42.621 --> 38:44.921
All right, someone's definitely
trying to fuck with us.

38:44.923 --> 38:48.725
Here. I'm gonna need you
to take this here.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.994
I'm gonna go outside
and fix the generator.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.095
Listen.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.830
The generator's still running.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.832
[motor running]

38:55.834 --> 38:58.335
Please, please, please
don't go out there, okay?

38:58.337 --> 39:02.105
[speaking Ukrainian]

39:02.107 --> 39:04.641
The spirit is very strong.
We can't turn on now.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.543
We need to get
the lights back on.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.412
I'm not gonna sit here in
the fucking dark. I'm going.

39:09.414 --> 39:11.681
Look, if someone's out there,
they want you to go out.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.751
That's why I'm going.
It's gonna be all right.

39:16.787 --> 39:19.856
Ethan, let's go, man.
I need to get the lights on.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.491
Take.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.360
- Take this!
- Fine, fine!

39:24.829 --> 39:28.064
The generator's still running.
Why are we going outside?

39:28.066 --> 39:30.066
Because we gotta
get it back on.

39:30.068 --> 39:31.267
It's already on!

39:43.147 --> 39:47.617
[motor running]

39:47.619 --> 39:49.652
Shit, dude.

39:57.461 --> 40:00.797
- Are you filming this?
- Yes, I'm filming it!

40:00.799 --> 40:02.665
Someone unplugged it.

40:02.667 --> 40:06.469
Somebody's here,
and they're fucking with us!

40:06.471 --> 40:09.272
All right, it's in.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.941
- Let's go.
- God dammit.

40:19.550 --> 40:20.917
- [rustling]
- What the--

40:20.919 --> 40:22.318
What the fuck was that?

40:22.320 --> 40:24.187
It came from over there.
Let's go.

40:24.189 --> 40:26.790
No, that wasn't
an animal, man.

40:26.792 --> 40:29.492
Please.
Ryan, let's just stay here.

40:29.494 --> 40:31.961
Let's go back inside.

40:34.198 --> 40:35.698
Fuck.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.640
Come on, man.

40:46.477 --> 40:47.911
It came from over there.
Let's go.

40:47.913 --> 40:50.613
Fuck, man.

40:50.615 --> 40:51.948
Please!

40:55.920 --> 40:59.022
Shine the light over here.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.723
Oh, shit.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.498
Yeah, it's in here.

41:09.867 --> 41:11.468
Here, let me see it.
Let me see it.

41:11.470 --> 41:14.804
Come on, let me see the camera.
Here, take this.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.172
- Let's go!
- Give me the camera.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.440
No, let's go, let's go!

41:17.442 --> 41:19.275
Ethan, give me the camera.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.177
Please, Ryan,
let's just go back.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.079
Hold this.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.848
God dammit.

41:28.118 --> 41:31.321
[cat screeching]

41:31.323 --> 41:33.256
Oh, God!

41:33.258 --> 41:35.425
Oh! No, no!

41:35.427 --> 41:38.228
It's the fucking--
The fire, get it out!

41:38.230 --> 41:39.562
Fuck, man.

41:39.564 --> 41:41.698
Shit, dude, are you all right?

41:41.700 --> 41:43.433
God dammit!

41:43.435 --> 41:45.702
Fuck, Ryan,
I tell you all the time!

41:45.704 --> 41:48.404
You never fucking listen to me!

41:48.406 --> 41:50.707
- Are you all right?
- Fuck!

41:50.709 --> 41:52.308
- [cat screeching]
- [glass shatters]

41:52.310 --> 41:53.543
JENNY: Ryan!

41:53.545 --> 41:55.111
- Oh, shit.
- Ryan!

41:55.113 --> 41:57.080
Oh, fuck.
Go, go, go, go!

41:57.082 --> 41:59.015
- Jenny!
- God dammit!

41:59.017 --> 42:00.850
Fuck!

42:00.852 --> 42:02.986
- We're coming!
- Hang on!

42:05.756 --> 42:08.324
Are you okay? Are you okay?
What happened?

42:08.326 --> 42:10.460
Fucking look!

42:10.462 --> 42:13.963
- What? Oh, fuck!
- What?

42:13.965 --> 42:15.899
What the fuck is it?

42:15.901 --> 42:18.434
What is it?

42:18.436 --> 42:20.970
What the fuck?

42:20.972 --> 42:23.406
- Jenny, turn on the light.
- Oh, my God.

42:23.408 --> 42:26.075
- Is that the same cat?
- It looks like it.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.578
That's the same fucking cat
that jumped on me!

42:28.580 --> 42:30.647
- What happened to your hand?
- I'm fine!

42:30.649 --> 42:33.983
A cat jumped out at us out there
and broke the kerosene lamp.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.552
Fuck!

42:35.554 --> 42:37.687
Where was Inna
when this happened?

42:37.689 --> 42:39.656
No, she was just sitting at that
table the whole fucking time.

42:39.658 --> 42:41.658
- Are you sure?
- Yes. No one was in there.

42:41.660 --> 42:44.827
We just heard
the fucking glass break.

42:44.829 --> 42:49.065
Look at the glass.
It came from the outside.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.000
Fuck. God damn.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.937
I wanna know what the fuck
is going on here!

42:53.939 --> 42:56.506
What is going on?

42:56.508 --> 42:59.175
I'm gonna get the fuck out of
here right now. We're leaving!

42:59.177 --> 43:02.145
We're fucking leaving!
I'm fucking leaving!

43:02.147 --> 43:04.280
I think the video's fake,
all right?

43:04.282 --> 43:06.115
Boris probably threw the cat
through the window or something,

43:06.117 --> 43:08.151
or it jumped through the glass
on its own.

43:08.153 --> 43:11.187
Did you see it? I mean,
it was completely torn apart.

43:11.189 --> 43:12.822
There's blood everywhere.

43:12.824 --> 43:15.525
Inna says that blood increases
the power of the spirit

43:15.527 --> 43:17.293
and weakens its victim.

43:17.295 --> 43:19.295
What, is that us?

43:19.297 --> 43:22.899
[speaking Ukrainian]

43:26.570 --> 43:28.905
The demon could possess the cat
to hurt Ethan,

43:28.907 --> 43:32.108
and demons are much stronger
and dangerous.

43:33.777 --> 43:36.713
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

43:36.715 --> 43:38.915
You don't want to sleep in?

43:38.917 --> 43:41.851
You know, nothing happened
last night.

43:41.853 --> 43:45.188
I don't know
what you're talking about.

43:45.190 --> 43:46.556
ETHAN: More suds.

43:46.558 --> 43:51.527
Cocktail, all we have is
vodka juice and bread.

43:51.529 --> 43:53.696
- She's crazy.
- What's up?

43:53.698 --> 43:55.698
Jenny has this scratch
on her side.

43:55.700 --> 43:57.333
She says I did it
during sex last night,

43:57.335 --> 43:58.534
but we never had sex.

43:58.536 --> 43:59.969
JENNY: Yes, you did.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.838
I don't know
what she's talking about.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.906
Sweetie, I don't know
what you're talking about.

44:03.908 --> 44:06.943
KATARINA: You know what?
You scratched me too.

44:06.945 --> 44:09.412
- Last night?
- Yes, last night.

44:09.414 --> 44:11.114
There's no way I--

44:11.116 --> 44:14.417
- Why are you acting like this?
- I'm not acting or anything.

44:14.419 --> 44:16.519
Why would I lie?

44:16.521 --> 44:18.388
Nothing happened.

44:18.390 --> 44:20.556
Really? Then who did this?

44:20.558 --> 44:24.360
Oh, God. I don't know.

44:24.362 --> 44:26.629
You wanna see something?

44:38.676 --> 44:41.210
There's nothing there.

44:42.980 --> 44:46.049
Someone's making up stories.

44:47.818 --> 44:49.352
It's not fucking funny.

44:49.354 --> 44:53.690
<i>[moaning]</i>

44:53.692 --> 44:55.091
You don't really
have to see this.

44:55.093 --> 44:57.193
- Jesus!
- See? You scratched her.

45:09.907 --> 45:12.208
I don't--
I don't remember that.

45:12.210 --> 45:14.677
Maybe because it was so short.

45:17.448 --> 45:21.317
All right, let's show Ryan
his performance then.

45:21.319 --> 45:25.822
<i>[moaning]</i>

45:25.824 --> 45:28.691
What the fuck is that?

45:28.693 --> 45:30.760
There's no way.
Inna must--

45:30.762 --> 45:32.195
She must have given me
something.

45:32.197 --> 45:34.430
Like there's no way
that I would've--

45:34.432 --> 45:36.232
Holy fuck.

45:37.534 --> 45:40.103
<i>[moaning, panting]</i>

45:46.910 --> 45:49.812
- That's not--
- What the fuck is going on?

45:49.814 --> 45:53.716
- You don't remember that?
- No, obviously not.

45:53.718 --> 45:55.284
Erase that.

45:55.286 --> 45:59.055
It might have been spirit
because remember what Inna said,

45:59.057 --> 46:02.825
that it can possess the cat,
so it can possess a human being.

46:02.827 --> 46:06.863
Yeah, and this injury, it just
lets him be closer to us.

46:06.865 --> 46:09.065
Okay, it doesn't matter
'cause we're leaving.

46:09.067 --> 46:11.267
Anyway, what time is
your friend getting here?

46:11.269 --> 46:12.468
Afternoon.

46:12.470 --> 46:16.038
Can you call him
and just make sure?

46:17.641 --> 46:21.177
His phone is off.
He out of signal.

46:21.179 --> 46:24.080
Oh, God.
Well, I'm packing up my stuff.

46:24.082 --> 46:26.249
There's no guarantee that her
fucking friend's gonna show up,

46:26.251 --> 46:29.585
so I don't wanna stay here any
longer than I fucking have to.

46:29.587 --> 46:31.154
The sawmill is not far.

46:31.156 --> 46:33.823
If we go now, we can fucking
get there before evening.

46:33.825 --> 46:36.425
But Inna said
that we have to be here

46:36.427 --> 46:37.860
until we invoke the spirits.

46:37.862 --> 46:40.363
Oh, my God! I know that
Inna is a fucking psychic,

46:40.365 --> 46:42.732
and she can see a bunch of
bullshit that we can't.

46:42.734 --> 46:45.668
But I saw that, okay?
That is enough for me.

46:45.670 --> 46:49.405
- We'll figure something out.
- You said that a hundred times.

46:49.407 --> 46:50.907
"I'll fucking figure it out."

46:50.909 --> 46:52.909
You wanna just shoot this
no matter what the cost,

46:52.911 --> 46:54.944
and I don't, okay?

46:54.946 --> 46:57.079
You know, you're being
so fucking selfish right now.

46:57.081 --> 46:59.048
You know how fucking important
this is for me.

46:59.050 --> 47:00.950
You know that
it's my father's money.

47:00.952 --> 47:02.385
If I don't come home
with something, I'm fucked!

47:02.387 --> 47:04.220
- I'm selfish? I'm selfish?
- Yeah.

47:04.222 --> 47:07.056
You think I don't wanna sit here
and just wait to get hurt

47:07.058 --> 47:08.524
or keep getting fucked around?

47:08.526 --> 47:10.760
What do you think
you're gonna shoot anyway?

47:10.762 --> 47:14.263
[speaking Ukrainian]

47:14.265 --> 47:15.998
Jenny!

47:16.000 --> 47:17.133
Jenny!

47:17.135 --> 47:19.001
- [speaking Ukrainian]
- Jenny!

47:19.003 --> 47:22.138
- Go with him!
- I know!

47:22.140 --> 47:24.040
No, dude,
something can happen to her.

47:24.042 --> 47:26.475
- Do you want the camera?
- No, I don't want the camera!

47:26.477 --> 47:29.679
This isn't the right time
for that. God dammit.

47:30.948 --> 47:32.915
She says that this picture
connects with spirit.

47:32.917 --> 47:35.017
We have to find out
who's in the picture.

47:35.019 --> 47:38.354
And how are we supposed
to do that?

47:38.356 --> 47:42.458
[speaking Ukrainian]

47:42.460 --> 47:46.562
That's what comes up
when you type in Yablochnoye?

47:46.564 --> 47:48.731
I mean, did you type it right?

47:48.733 --> 47:51.000
Who is this guy?

47:52.402 --> 47:54.804
Yeah. Everything's correct.

47:54.806 --> 47:58.174
This is Chikatilo.
He was a serial killer.

47:58.176 --> 48:00.343
Well, let's see if we can find
any more information.

48:00.345 --> 48:01.878
Ethan!

48:01.880 --> 48:02.979
That was Ryan.

48:02.981 --> 48:05.248
[distant shouting continues]

48:07.551 --> 48:09.252
What?

48:09.254 --> 48:12.321
- What the heck does he want?
- I don't know.

48:14.391 --> 48:17.126
- All right, we're coming!
- Come here!

48:17.128 --> 48:18.594
Get your jacket.

48:18.596 --> 48:21.364
Should be close. It's only
half a mile from the house.

48:23.100 --> 48:24.700
Oh, my God.
That's their car.

48:24.702 --> 48:27.336
We haven't gone inside yet.

48:30.440 --> 48:32.441
Oh, shit.

48:32.443 --> 48:33.910
Fuck.

48:38.849 --> 48:41.250
[grunts]
The door's locked.

48:42.219 --> 48:44.453
Don't. You don't understand.

48:45.822 --> 48:48.124
There's blood
all over the carpet.

48:48.126 --> 48:50.493
There's no sign of
Valeriy's body anywhere.

48:50.495 --> 48:52.662
Maybe someone pulled him out.

48:52.664 --> 48:55.298
Yeah. Boris,
he pulled him out,

48:55.300 --> 48:58.367
and he's probably the one
who's messing with us.

48:58.369 --> 49:00.770
He's the one
making the noises.

49:00.772 --> 49:03.773
Yeah, that's Inna.
She curse him!

49:03.775 --> 49:05.241
Now we have to go back
to the house,

49:05.243 --> 49:07.376
otherwise
she will curse us too.

49:07.378 --> 49:09.078
She's fucking right.

49:09.080 --> 49:11.447
This whole time Inna's been
blaming some spirit,

49:11.449 --> 49:13.883
but she's been moving the glass.
I told you that!

49:13.885 --> 49:18.788
[speaking Ukrainian]

49:28.865 --> 49:31.400
Katarina, forget about it.

49:31.402 --> 49:33.002
She says we can't leave.

49:33.004 --> 49:36.172
Well, we'll see about that.
We're gonna start walking now.

49:46.783 --> 49:48.484
Shh, shh, shh.

49:52.189 --> 49:53.856
I hear it again.

50:05.469 --> 50:08.170
All right, nobody's there.
Keep going.

50:14.878 --> 50:18.214
[retching]

50:18.216 --> 50:20.950
Shit. I can't go anymore, okay?

50:20.952 --> 50:25.421
This scratch,
it's hurting me so much.

50:25.423 --> 50:28.124
Mine hurts too.

50:28.126 --> 50:31.894
Oh, fuck, it's bleeding.
What the fuck?

50:31.896 --> 50:32.962
Ohh...

50:32.964 --> 50:34.830
Hurt so much.

50:34.832 --> 50:37.533
Okay.

50:37.535 --> 50:40.069
All right.

50:40.071 --> 50:43.406
All right, I'm gonna
go ahead to the sawmill.

50:43.408 --> 50:46.642
You guys stay here.
I'll come back.

50:46.644 --> 50:48.110
Don't worry.

50:48.112 --> 50:49.879
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

50:49.881 --> 50:52.948
Oh, fuck, not you!

50:52.950 --> 50:56.085
Why the fuck
is this happening?

50:59.589 --> 51:01.657
What the fuck
happened to your face, man?

51:01.659 --> 51:03.292
I started bleeding

51:03.294 --> 51:05.928
when I started getting
further away from the house.

51:05.930 --> 51:08.697
We gotta get back there
before it gets dark.

51:08.699 --> 51:10.132
Come on.

51:11.768 --> 51:13.869
Are you okay?

51:15.372 --> 51:17.273
We gotta get back.

51:19.476 --> 51:23.979
[speaking Ukrainian]

51:30.987 --> 51:33.022
[speaking Ukrainian]

51:35.492 --> 51:37.326
- Wait, is she leaving?
- She'll be back.

51:37.328 --> 51:39.161
- Where is she going?
- She'll be back.

51:39.163 --> 51:41.897
She'll be back
and she believes you.

51:44.134 --> 51:47.269
Ryan, you need to come
take a look at this,

51:47.271 --> 51:51.640
some footage that Katarina and I
found on the Internet.

51:53.677 --> 51:56.712
His name was
Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo.

51:56.714 --> 51:58.781
Okay, wait, is he from here?

51:58.783 --> 52:03.319
Well, Katarina says
he was born in the Ukraine

52:03.321 --> 52:08.090
in a village called Yablochnoye,
which is where we saw the cows,

52:08.092 --> 52:12.128
and it's close to the sawmill,
where he interviewed Boris.

52:12.130 --> 52:15.064
And you think that
that's him.

52:15.066 --> 52:17.633
I don't know. I hope not.

52:17.635 --> 52:19.969
I mean, this guy--

52:19.971 --> 52:21.770
This guy's sick.

52:21.772 --> 52:25.975
They say he's worse
than Jeffrey Dahmer.

52:25.977 --> 52:27.877
He was brutal.

52:27.879 --> 52:31.814
I mean, he killed
over 50 people:

52:31.816 --> 52:35.451
women and children,
boys and girls.

52:35.453 --> 52:37.786
I mean, he ripped them apart
with his teeth.

52:37.788 --> 52:41.056
He ate their genitals.
He stabbed them repeatedly.

52:41.058 --> 52:43.626
And he got off on it.

52:48.698 --> 52:52.301
They called him the Ripper
or something like that.

52:52.303 --> 52:55.171
- That was his nickname.
- Named the Rostov Butcher.

52:55.173 --> 52:57.506
He claimed he was
a mistake of nature,

52:57.508 --> 53:00.676
and he was trying
to plead insanity

53:00.678 --> 53:05.681
before they executed him on
the 14th of February, 1994.

53:05.683 --> 53:10.286
And he blamed his insanity on
an experience of his childhood,

53:10.288 --> 53:15.724
when somebody killed
and ate his brother Stepan.

53:15.726 --> 53:19.261
Katarina, how do you write...

53:19.263 --> 53:22.531
Chikatilo's initials
in Ukrainian?

53:22.533 --> 53:24.934
It's RS.

53:24.936 --> 53:27.269
Is this it?

53:27.271 --> 53:29.104
Um, I don't know.

53:29.106 --> 53:32.208
It's RSCH.

53:32.210 --> 53:34.877
Or CH could be
before Chikatilo.

53:34.879 --> 53:38.447
What was the name
of his brother?

53:38.449 --> 53:40.082
Stepan.

53:42.953 --> 53:48.724
Andrei Stepan Chikatilo.

53:48.726 --> 53:52.595
Andrei and Stepan Chikatilo.

53:52.597 --> 53:54.496
Oh, my God.

53:54.498 --> 53:56.365
Look at this.

53:58.168 --> 54:01.637
That's what he did to them?

54:01.639 --> 54:03.205
Mm-hmm.

54:03.207 --> 54:06.041
Wait, what is that?

54:06.043 --> 54:08.777
What?

54:08.779 --> 54:11.080
Let me see that.

54:13.950 --> 54:15.884
That looks like him.

54:15.886 --> 54:18.754
- What?
- That one.

54:21.057 --> 54:22.324
Fuck.

54:22.326 --> 54:25.194
Katarina, let me see yours.

54:26.796 --> 54:29.265
Oh, fuck,
it's the same scratch.

54:29.267 --> 54:31.667
Fuck. This is
too much for me.

54:33.203 --> 54:35.404
Looks exactly the same.

54:50.387 --> 54:55.324
Hey. It's gonna be okay,
all right?

54:55.326 --> 54:57.960
We're gonna get out
of here, all right?

54:57.962 --> 55:00.529
Can you trust me?

55:00.531 --> 55:03.198
Okay, we're gonna
get out of here.

55:04.901 --> 55:08.804
So the signal is gone,
and we can't call anybody.

55:08.806 --> 55:12.574
Inna's the only person
who can help us now.

55:20.150 --> 55:22.718
[speaking Ukrainianj]

55:28.358 --> 55:30.492
She suspected this,
but she had to be sure.

55:30.494 --> 55:32.895
So in the house,
we are under protection.

56:20.176 --> 56:21.710
So...

56:23.780 --> 56:26.482
Inna's going to apply
the ointment

56:26.484 --> 56:28.851
on Katarina, Jenny, and Ethan.

56:28.853 --> 56:31.587
She says that it should
protect them.

56:31.589 --> 56:35.324
She also says that
Chikatilo used the wounds

56:35.326 --> 56:38.127
in order possess
Jennifer and Ethan.

56:38.129 --> 56:43.132
Ethan was possessed through the
scratch by the cat in the barn.

56:43.134 --> 56:47.236
But how did it
get to Jennifer?

56:47.238 --> 56:49.638
Get the fuck off.

56:56.012 --> 56:58.213
[speaking Ukrainian]

56:59.349 --> 57:01.550
Light those candles.

57:03.453 --> 57:06.655
Inna believes that the spirit
of Chikatilo was here

57:06.657 --> 57:09.158
and is seeking revenge
for the death of his brother,

57:09.160 --> 57:11.560
who was killed and eaten
in this house.

57:13.129 --> 57:15.130
We had nothing to do
with his brother's death,

57:15.132 --> 57:18.901
so we're hoping he'll let us
leave like he did with Boris.

57:41.491 --> 57:43.625
[speaking Ukrainian]

58:20.897 --> 58:23.599
All right, Ethan,
take the camera.

58:28.538 --> 58:31.974
- Is the camera okay?
- It looks fine.

58:33.810 --> 58:35.377
Wait a minute.

58:35.379 --> 58:37.179
Where is she?

58:37.181 --> 58:40.082
She went somewhere over there.

58:42.218 --> 58:44.319
Katarina!

59:00.403 --> 59:04.606
[speaking Ukrainian]

59:09.479 --> 59:12.748
She's completely exhausted.

59:13.983 --> 59:17.052
[screaming]

59:17.054 --> 59:18.353
Ryan!

59:18.355 --> 59:21.657
- Ryan, help me out!
- [screaming]

59:21.659 --> 59:24.993
Get off of her!
Get off of her!

59:24.995 --> 59:27.529
[Katarina whimpers]

59:27.531 --> 59:29.531
- Hold her! Hold her down!
- I'm trying!

59:29.533 --> 59:31.833
Jen, get something
to tie her down!

59:31.835 --> 59:33.535
She's bleeding.

59:33.537 --> 59:39.441
[speaking Ukrainian]

59:50.119 --> 59:52.454
What's she saying?

59:52.456 --> 59:56.391
She's talking to a baby
that was never born.

59:56.393 --> 59:58.427
Says "Nicole."

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:03.398
What baby?

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.101
[Inna laughs]

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:19.181
She's fucking possessed!

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:31.960
Holy fuck.

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.943
Why can't we just wait
till morning?

01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:50.012
It'll be easier
in the morning.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:54.650
Because that's what spirit said,
so we have to go and find it.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:58.420
Let's just go. If we go, we'll
be able to find it somehow.

01:00:58.422 --> 01:01:00.355
It doesn't matter, okay?

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:03.625
He let Boris leave because he
did what he wanted, all right?

01:01:03.627 --> 01:01:05.160
And then the spirit,
it forced him

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:06.862
to bury that tape
in the barn, okay?

01:01:06.864 --> 01:01:08.230
She's probably right.

01:01:08.232 --> 01:01:11.500
If you do what he wants,
he will let us leave,

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:13.301
so let's go.

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:15.337
That's true.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:16.938
Get up!

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:21.743
Are you still shooting
or is that just the light?

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:23.679
Yes, I'm filming.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.550
We're looking for the cross.

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:36.458
Keep going.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.194
Just ignore it.
Just keep going straight.

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:41.363
Found it?

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:42.698
That's it.

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:49.971
Please, please let's just
get this done. Please.

01:01:49.973 --> 01:01:52.541
This is the cross
Inna told us about,

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:58.246
and we're supposed to dig about
five meters in front of it.

01:01:58.248 --> 01:02:02.951
We've been digging for an hour,
and this is all we have.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.789
I can't do it.

01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:11.126
This grass is too hard.
Why don't you fucking help me?

01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:13.228
Just sitting there fucking
filming the goddamn thing.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:17.299
Why don't you fucking help me?
Get down here and fucking dig!

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:21.436
All right, give me the shovel.
I'll do it for a while.

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:22.704
[crash]

01:02:22.706 --> 01:02:24.606
Help me! Help me!
I'm slipping!

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:27.776
- I'm trying!
- I'm slipping! Oh, God!

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:30.445
I got you!
Let go of the shovel!

01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:33.215
Okay.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:35.150
- Fuck!
- Are you okay?

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:39.321
Holy shit!
We fucking found it.

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:41.056
Be careful, okay?

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.594
Here. Hold it tight.

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:52.067
It looks like it could be
the bones of a child.

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:53.201
Oh, my God.

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:56.004
That's Chikatilo's brother
Stepan.

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:59.207
What is that? It looks like
a rosary or something.

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:01.877
They must have just buried him
just like this,

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:04.079
and the spirit wants us
to give him a proper burial.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:05.914
That's why he brought us here.

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:08.583
He wants his brother
to finally rest in peace.

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:09.851
Yeah, Katarina's right.

01:03:09.853 --> 01:03:11.653
We got what it wanted,

01:03:11.655 --> 01:03:13.855
and we don't have to give it
back to him till this is over.

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:15.357
We could use this.

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:18.193
How you gonna use it?
What are you talking about?

01:03:18.195 --> 01:03:20.529
We have to listen to him.
We will bring it into the house.

01:03:20.531 --> 01:03:22.964
We don't have to do shit.
We're the fucking idiots.

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.966
We're running around
and doing whatever he says.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.768
No, we will bring it
to the house.

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:28.970
- We will finish it now!
- What is wrong with you?

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:30.605
Jennifer's right!
We have to do what he wants!

01:03:30.607 --> 01:03:34.342
Everyone shut the fuck up!
We're not listening to him!

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:35.877
- You got it?
- [shouts]

01:03:35.879 --> 01:03:37.479
[crash]

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.447
Oh, fuck!

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:41.183
- Oh, my God!
- Ryan!

01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:42.617
Ryan, are you okay?

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:45.587
No! I fucking broke my leg!

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:48.023
Jenny, she just ran
into the woods!

01:03:48.025 --> 01:03:50.892
- She ran into the woods!
- Fucking go after her!

01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:52.260
Fucking go get her!

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:55.063
Okay. Katarina, you stay here.
Stay with Ryan.

01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:58.967
I'll go, okay?
I'm going after her.

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:06.374
Jenny! Jenny!

01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:07.609
Jenny!

01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:09.578
God, what the fuck!

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:12.414
Jenny! Jenny.

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:15.617
Jenny? Jenny.

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:17.319
Jenny.

01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:18.453
Jenny, are you okay?

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:19.454
I don't know.

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:20.856
Jenny.

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:22.624
Jenny, are you okay?

01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:24.159
Jenny?

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:26.695
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why did you do that?

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:28.930
I don't--
What are you talking about?

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:30.365
You don't remember?

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.734
Remember what? Where?

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:35.604
You pushed Ryan into the hole.

01:04:35.606 --> 01:04:36.905
What?

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:38.874
Fuck! Is he okay?

01:04:38.876 --> 01:04:40.175
- Where is he?
- He's okay.

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:41.977
It's okay, come on.
Come on.

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:44.512
Come on, we gotta go, Jenny.
Come on, get up. Please.

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:46.014
Please. Come on.

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:48.083
We gotta go. Let's go.

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:52.120
Jenny, this way, please.

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:53.188
Come on.

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:55.957
Come on, Jenny.

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:08.336
Where the fuck is the hole?

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:10.839
Where's the hole?

01:05:10.841 --> 01:05:13.875
- Where is it?
- Ryan!

01:05:13.877 --> 01:05:17.345
- Where's the shovel?
- Ryan!

01:05:17.347 --> 01:05:19.581
Where's Ryan?

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:21.416
Help me!

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:22.717
I'm trying.

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:24.519
[crying]

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:26.254
Ryan!

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.390
Oh, God. Hold on.

01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:30.292
Fuck. Fuck.

01:05:30.294 --> 01:05:31.359
Come on.

01:05:32.895 --> 01:05:34.362
God dammit.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:36.164
Come on!

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:41.770
I can't do it, Jenny.
I can't take it.

01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:43.538
[crying]

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.574
We gotta go.

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:49.377
We gotta go back, okay?

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.348
Please.

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:54.449
I don't wanna go.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.351
Come on, Jenny.

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:00.055
Come on.

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:09.097
It's not your fault,
Jenny, okay?

01:06:09.099 --> 01:06:11.700
Yes, it is.
You don't-

01:06:11.702 --> 01:06:13.568
- It's not your fault.
- You don't understand.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.705
- I knew I was lying to him.
- It's not your fault.

01:06:16.707 --> 01:06:19.240
I was fucking lying to him,
and I never told him.

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:25.447
And he said he wanted a kid,
and I can't, you know?

01:06:25.449 --> 01:06:27.248
I'm sorry.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:30.685
Look at me, Jenny.
It's not your fault.

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:32.120
It is, okay?

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:34.222
It wasn't Inna that had
the abortion. It was me.

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:36.524
It was fucking years ago,
and now he knows that,

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:40.362
and he's fucking doing this
to punish me.

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:42.731
Calm down, okay?

01:06:42.733 --> 01:06:44.466
Okay, what more do you
want from us?

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:47.836
Because if it's me,
fucking take me then!

01:06:47.838 --> 01:06:51.206
We have given you everything
you asked for!

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:54.409
You should just die,
you motherfucker!

01:06:54.411 --> 01:06:55.844
Fuck!

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.413
Wait, where are you?

01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:00.382
Just don't--
Hang on, okay?

01:07:00.384 --> 01:07:02.684
I'm trying to get the night
vision working on the camera.

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:03.918
Fuck!

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.720
I can't find--

01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:06.788
Hold on.

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:08.423
- Fuck. There somebody--
- What?

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:10.291
Oh, God, someone's there.
He just touched the scratch.

01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:11.726
- What?
- Fuck, he's right there.

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:13.161
Can you hear him?
He's breathing.

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:17.232
Hang on, okay?
I'm trying to get it--

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:18.733
Fuck. Fuck!

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:20.301
Okay, I got it, I got it.

01:07:20.303 --> 01:07:22.103
He's right there.
You see him?

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:23.705
Can't you hear him breathing?
He's right there.

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:25.340
There's no one there.
There's no one beside you.

01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:26.741
You can hear him.
He's right next to me.

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:28.276
I don't see anything.

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:31.813
Jenny! Come on!
We gotta go back to the house!

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:32.947
Come on!

01:07:32.949 --> 01:07:34.449
Keep going!

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:38.053
Right up ahead!

01:07:38.055 --> 01:07:40.622
Right up ahead, let's go!

01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:42.924
Let's go! Come on!

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:46.995
Keep going!

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:57.639
Okay, it stopped.

01:07:57.641 --> 01:07:59.974
We gotta go back to the house.
Come on, let's go.

01:07:59.976 --> 01:08:01.643
Let's go, Jenny.

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:06.281
Wait, there's the house.
You see it?

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:08.750
You see the light?
There it is.

Come on, Jenny, come on.

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:25.533
Oh, my God.
That's Ryan's camera.

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:26.968
He might be here.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:29.671
Ryan! Ryan!

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:31.038

01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:33.608
Ryan!

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.711

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.680
Inna! Inna!

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:39.881
Inna, wake up.

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:41.416
Inna!

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.484

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:47.721
Jenny...

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:49.224
Inna, talk to me.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:52.359

01:08:52.362 --> 01:08:54.462
Jenny, come on.
She can't help you.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:55.997

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:23.424
No.

01:09:23.426 --> 01:09:26.327
<i>RYAN: Katarina, don't.
Katarina, don't come down here.</i>

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:29.663
Katarina, don't.
It's not safe.

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.452
Come here, motherfucker!

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:03.691
He killed him!

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:04.892
And Katarina.

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:06.494
These are the fucking tunnels

01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:09.330
that those locals
were talking about.

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:11.432
He eats people there.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:13.601
What the fuck
does he want from us?

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:17.472
He put the camera here because
he wanted us to watch it!

01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:20.074
- That son of a bitch!
- I can't stay here anymore.

01:11:20.076 --> 01:11:21.576

- Come back!

01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:25.747
Jenny! We can't leave!
He won't let us go!

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:27.515
Calm down!

01:11:27.517 --> 01:11:30.418
Calm down, okay?

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.819
Okay?

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:34.255
Shh.

01:11:34.257 --> 01:11:37.458
He brought the bones
of his brother here.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.860
Keeps revolving
around them.

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:47.835
We have to invoke him again
and do what he wants.

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:50.605
We couldn't read the writing
on the table,

01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:54.075
so we redone it
in our alphabet.

01:11:54.077 --> 01:11:55.677
Hopefully it'll still work.

01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:57.578
You ready?

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.147
Mm-hmm.

You want us to eat...

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:20.668
- You want us to eat her?
- No.

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:23.471
No, we're not gonna do it.
You hear me?

01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:25.807
We're not gonna fucking do it!

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:28.309
Boris may have done it, but
we're not gonna fucking do it!

01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:30.178

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:56.838
Get out of her body! Now!

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.307
I don't care what you are,
ghost or demon,

01:12:59.309 --> 01:13:00.875
you go straight to hell!

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.910
Get out of her body!

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:17.358
- Oh, my God!

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:21.829
Give me the camera, Jenny!
Come on!

Let me see, let me see.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.653
Oh, my God. Okay.

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:49.257
Jenny, come on, we gotta
keep going. I know it hurts.

01:13:49.259 --> 01:13:51.092
- What if he--
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:52.393
What's he want?

01:13:52.395 --> 01:13:54.629
- It's not that far.
- Far from what?

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:59.634
A village, a road, a something.
We gotta get help. Come on.
