00:02.670 --> 00:06.839
"The Profit"...
a New York fashion designer
was once a phenomenal success...

00:06.907 --> 00:08.741
What's the biggest year
that you've had?

00:08.809 --> 00:10.075
SUSANA: 13 million.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.945
LEMONIS: ...but today, she finds
herself under siege.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.913
SUSANA: There's no respect here
for me at all.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.648
There's no respect.
Where's the respect?

00:16.717 --> 00:18.717
LEMONIS: Customers
are deserting her label.

00:18.786 --> 00:21.954
ANNA: Honestly, we didn't
make any money since 2009.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.922
LEMONIS: Friends and family
are demanding

00:23.991 --> 00:25.591
a piece of her business.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.593
SUSANA: The brothers think
I owe them their birth right.

00:27.661 --> 00:28.594
LEMONIS: I feel like
you're being kind of,

00:28.662 --> 00:29.795
like, shaken down.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.663
And instead of standing
up for herself

00:31.732 --> 00:33.465
and fighting for her brand,

00:33.534 --> 00:35.801
she's letting it fall
apart at the seams.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.903
SUSANA: This is bull[BLEEP]
It's total bull[BLEEP]

00:37.972 --> 00:41.073
LEMONIS: If I can't
help her regain confidence

00:41.142 --> 00:43.609
and harness
her incredible talent...

00:43.677 --> 00:45.244
SUSANA: It's really
stressful to...

00:45.312 --> 00:48.113
LEMONIS:
...Susana Monaco's best days

00:48.182 --> 00:49.681
will be behind her.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.683
My name is Marcus Lemonis,

00:51.752 --> 00:53.385
and I risk my own money

00:53.454 --> 00:55.521
to save struggling businesses.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.423
We're not going to wake up
every morning wondering

00:57.491 --> 00:58.724
if we have a job.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.259
We're going to wake up
every morning wondering

01:00.327 --> 01:01.660
how many jobs
we have to do.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.629
It's not always pretty.

01:03.697 --> 01:06.131
Everything's going to change.
Everything.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.233
But I do it to save jobs,

01:08.302 --> 01:10.102
and I do it to make money.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.437
This...
Let's go to work.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.939
...is "The Profit."

01:18.312 --> 01:22.681
In 1996, Susana Monaco
launched her namesake label,

01:22.750 --> 01:25.751
a collection of women's
apparel marked by clean

01:25.820 --> 01:27.453
and contemporary designs.

01:27.521 --> 01:30.255
SUSANA: The front is
narrower than the back.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.558
LEMONIS: She had grown up
working at her family's

01:32.626 --> 01:34.026
cut-and-sew factory

01:34.095 --> 01:37.129
and then engaged them
to help her with manufacturing.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.566
Before long, she was
in thousands of retailers

01:40.634 --> 01:44.103
across the country with revenue
exceeding $10 million.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.771
ANNA: This is
the best-selling for holiday.

01:45.840 --> 01:46.939
They love it.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.207
LEMONIS:
But the Great Recession

01:48.275 --> 01:51.043
dealt the label a severe blow,

01:51.112 --> 01:53.946
and Susana has been unable
to reverse the damage.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.214
SUSANA: Stay in business
or not stay in business...

01:55.282 --> 01:56.748
that's the choice.

01:56.817 --> 02:00.119
LEMONIS: Today, sales are off
more than 50% from their peak.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.386
SUSANA: This is devastating.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.656
LEMONIS: And the company
is bleeding money.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.426
I'm looking to grow
my fashion business,

02:07.495 --> 02:09.527
and despite Susana's troubles,

02:09.597 --> 02:11.930
I'm impressed by the success
she's had in the past.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.299
If I can help get
the brand back on track,

02:14.368 --> 02:17.703
I'm confident she can have
an even brighter future.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.339
ANNA: Hi.
LEMONIS: Hi.

02:20.407 --> 02:21.273
ANNA: How are you?
LEMONIS: How are you?

02:21.342 --> 02:22.608
I'm Marcus.
ANNA: Anna.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.709
LEMONIS: Nice to meet you, Anna.
ANNA: Nice to meet you.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.811
LEMONIS:
Is this the showroom?

02:25.880 --> 02:27.212
ANNA:
Yes, please come in.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.214
LEMONIS: Okay.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.150
ANNA: Marcus,
this is Susana.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.151
LEMONIS: Oh, hi, Susana.

02:32.219 --> 02:33.252
SUSANA: Hi.
LEMONIS: Marcus.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.386
SUSANA: Hi, Marcus.
Nice to meet you.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.721
LEMONIS: How are you?
Nice to meet you.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.490
SUSANA: Yeah.
LEMONIS: Don't be nervous.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.292
You guys manufacture
your own stuff?

02:40.361 --> 02:41.527
ANNA: Yes.
SUSANA: Yes.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.362
ANNA: We manufacture
in our New Jersey factory.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.863
Sue is responsible for design,

02:44.932 --> 02:47.166
and I'm responsible
for all operations and sales.

02:47.234 --> 02:49.101
LEMONIS: So you handle
production and sales?

02:49.170 --> 02:51.737
ANNA: Yes.
I'm very capable.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.071
LEMONIS:
That's interesting.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.841
SUSANA: The front stuff
is too emotional for me.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.609
ANNA: Sue is the creative
engine of the company.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.577
SUSANA: Yeah.
ANNA: So we don't want

02:58.646 --> 03:00.179
to expose her to all the...

03:00.247 --> 03:01.947
you know,
all the unpleasant stuff.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.216
SUSANA: I don't like to be
in the front of things.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.417
LEMONIS: Okay.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.452
SUSANA: I like to be
in my world working.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.721
LEMONIS: You're the artist.
SUSANA: Yes. I just...

03:09.790 --> 03:12.424
ANNA: She's very... takes
everything very close to heart.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.459
And, you know, in operations,
every day there is a problem.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.028
There is... I mean,
every second there is a problem.

03:16.096 --> 03:19.031
Not every day...
every five minutes.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.633
LEMONIS: Right away I noticed
this very interesting dynamic

03:21.702 --> 03:23.869
between the two of them.
Anna's the employee,

03:23.938 --> 03:25.938
but she's dominating
the conversation,

03:26.006 --> 03:29.007
and Susana, who's the owner
who has her name on the door,

03:29.076 --> 03:31.343
she's standing there
like a bystander.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.978
Why don't we look
at the product?

03:33.047 --> 03:36.081
SUSANA: Okay.
LEMONIS: Let's do that.

03:36.150 --> 03:37.382
What's the demo?

03:37.451 --> 03:38.951
SUSANA: I would say
that it's a cross section.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.652
There's the young girl in there.
There's a middle girl.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.422
There's a working girl.
There's a lot of girls in there.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.624
LEMONIS: Is that code for saying
it's all over the place?

03:45.693 --> 03:48.660
SUSANA: Um, maybe.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.062
LEMONIS: Look,
you would expect a company

03:50.130 --> 03:51.697
like this to have a core lineup,

03:51.765 --> 03:54.666
a clear direction on exactly
what they were selling,

03:54.735 --> 03:56.868
and there would be
some consistency to it.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.403
Who's your customer for this?

03:58.472 --> 04:00.072
ANNA: Well this is
a young doll.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.440
SUSANA: 20s, 30s.

04:01.508 --> 04:02.841
ANNA: 20s, not even 30s.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.743
LEMONIS: But when you look
at her lineup here,

04:04.812 --> 04:05.911
it's all over the place.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.879
There's a dress
made of this material

04:07.948 --> 04:09.548
and pants made of that material,

04:09.617 --> 04:13.318
and there's no story
to the lineup, no collection.

04:13.387 --> 04:16.088
I'll tell you what's
interesting about this rack.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.656
This is a very easy
crossover to somebody

04:18.726 --> 04:20.392
who likes to live
in athleisure wear.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.560
SUSANA: Yes.
ANNA: Yes.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.295
This is supplex,
which is our base fabric.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.597
LEMONIS: Okay. That's
how Susana started the company.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.833
LEMONIS: It has
a spandex feel to it.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.201
So it helps people
with shape and curves.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.636
SUSANA: Shape is great.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.238
LEMONIS: But that's a very
different fabric than this.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.973
'Cause this is not supplex.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.808
What's the problem?
SUSANA: It's a little dry.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.044
The economy crashed,
our price point changed,

04:39.113 --> 04:40.712
so we had to work accordingly.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.414
ANNA: Supplex fabric
is unaffordable.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.683
SUSANA: The supplex
is almost $10 a yard.

04:44.752 --> 04:45.951
That's the kicker.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.586
LEMONIS: So this fabric
is how much a yard?

04:47.655 --> 04:48.687
BOTH: About $4.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.122
LEMONIS: What are
the overall margins?

04:50.190 --> 04:51.857
SUSANA: The overall margin
of the company is...

04:51.925 --> 04:54.526
you know, not great.
It's in the 40s.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.261
LEMONIS: In a business
like this, your margin

04:56.330 --> 04:58.864
should be no less than 50%.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.332
And what's even more surprising

05:00.401 --> 05:02.000
is they should be
even higher,

05:02.069 --> 05:04.936
considering that they're using
low-quality materials.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.139
What it really tells me
is that there has

05:07.207 --> 05:09.641
to be terrible inefficiencies
in their process

05:09.710 --> 05:11.843
that I'll have
to look out for.

05:11.912 --> 05:15.013
ANNA: Okay, so this
is the pattern-making area.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.582
Everything is done
on the computer, all patterns.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.551
LEMONIS: And you're
literally making to order.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.086
SUSANA: Yes.
LEMONIS: Sell an order,

05:21.155 --> 05:22.788
cut, sew it,
and ship it.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.222
SUSANA: Yes.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.491
LEMONIS: And so, when it goes
to the cut and sew shop,

05:26.560 --> 05:27.726
they work off this pattern.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.028
SUSANA: Yes.
My dad's manufacturing plant.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.730
LEMONIS: Oh, you're
at your dad's building.

05:31.799 --> 05:32.931
SUSANA: Yes.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.534
LEMONIS: So you're paying
your dad rent.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.735
SUSANA: Yes.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.170
LEMONIS: So I should think
about the factory

05:38.238 --> 05:39.237
as a shared building...

05:39.306 --> 05:40.539
SUSANA: Yes.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.207
LEMONIS: ...where your employees
make your clothes.

05:42.276 --> 05:44.710
SUSANA: Yes.
LEMONIS: ...and his employees

05:44.778 --> 05:46.778
do third-party manufacturing
for other people?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.080
SUSANA: Yes.
LEMONIS: How often do you...

05:48.148 --> 05:50.282
How much time
do you spend there?

05:50.351 --> 05:52.818
SUSANA: I don't spend
any time there.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.052
LEMONIS: You don't
go see what...

05:54.121 --> 05:55.153
You don't inspect
what's happening?

05:55.222 --> 05:58.056
SUSANA: No.
I used to, um, go, not...

05:58.125 --> 06:00.125
LEMONIS: When's the last time
you were there?

06:00.194 --> 06:01.360
SUSANA: The last time...
LEMONIS: Last week?

06:01.428 --> 06:02.694
SUSANA: No. No. No.
ANNA: No.

06:02.763 --> 06:03.895
LEMONIS: Last month?
SUSANA: I would say, months.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.464
LEMONIS: Do you go, Anna?
ANNA: I don't go.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.699
They don't like us.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.101
LEMONIS:
Your employees don't like you?

06:09.169 --> 06:11.703
ANNA: Her brothers.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.838
LEMONIS: What do the brothers

06:12.906 --> 06:13.972
have to do
with your dad's building?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.073
SUSANA:
They're running the factory.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.441
ANNA: They're running
the factory.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.744
LEMONIS: So you have
no interaction with the people

06:18.812 --> 06:20.612
that actually make your clothes?

06:20.681 --> 06:23.081
SUSANA: Yes, no contact.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.984
LEMONIS: So this is a business
relationship, contract labor,

06:26.053 --> 06:27.919
where you're paying
for all the employees

06:27.988 --> 06:29.855
and all the work that's done.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.991
That's your only source
of manufacturing the products.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.327
But Susana never actually
goes to the factory

06:35.396 --> 06:37.195
that she pays
the employees in?

06:37.264 --> 06:40.031
Because she's got some
problem with her family?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.600
I'm gonna spend
a few minutes with Susana

06:41.668 --> 06:43.168
so I can get to know her.
ANNA: Yes. Mm-hmm.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.703
LEMONIS: Why did you
get into this business?

06:44.772 --> 06:46.037
SUSANA: I was born
in this business.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.038
LEMONIS: You were how?

06:47.107 --> 06:48.940
SUSANA: My dad moved here
from Italy

06:49.009 --> 06:51.176
in the late '50s, early '60s.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.812
He started manufacturing
clothing.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.947
I grew up in that factory.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.482
Worked there through
high school.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.418
I did the designs.
LEMONIS: And he manufactured.

06:59.486 --> 07:00.585
SUSANA: He manufactured.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.053
LEMONIS: And then what
do you do next?

07:02.122 --> 07:03.688
SUSANA: I worked with a few
really great companies.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.925
Mm, didn't really feel...

07:06.994 --> 07:09.494
I don't know, fulfilled enough,
so I created the collection

07:09.563 --> 07:11.329
and it was going
incredibly well.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.432
LEMONIS: What's the biggest year
that you've had?

07:13.500 --> 07:16.435
SUSANA: $13 million,
then my father decides

07:16.503 --> 07:18.570
that I should split
the stock of my company

07:18.639 --> 07:20.572
with my brothers equally.
LEMONIS: Why?

07:20.641 --> 07:23.909
SUSANA:
Because he wants his family

07:23.977 --> 07:26.144
to be secure in life.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.979
This is old-school way
of doing things,

07:28.048 --> 07:29.314
'cause all of my...

07:29.383 --> 07:30.382
LEMONIS: Okay, hold on a second.
SUSANA: Yeah. Yeah.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.217
LEMONIS:
He walks up and says,

07:32.286 --> 07:34.286
"I know you started
this business by yourself,

07:34.354 --> 07:35.787
you're doing amazing,

07:35.856 --> 07:38.757
and I want you to take
two-thirds of the business

07:38.826 --> 07:40.125
and I want you
to give it away."

07:40.194 --> 07:41.593
SUSANA: Yes.
LEMONIS: To your brothers?

07:41.662 --> 07:42.727
SUSANA: Yes.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.062
LEMONIS: Who are not
in the business?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.031
SUSANA: They're actually
working at the factory.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.433
LEMONIS: And so their payroll
is coming from your production.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.702
SUSANA: Yes. Yes.
Paying them a salary.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.838
LEMONIS: And did your brothers
put any money in your company?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.473
SUSANA: No.

07:54.541 --> 07:58.210
It's not fine, but...

07:58.278 --> 08:00.278
LEMONIS: So, I feel like
you're being kind of,

08:00.347 --> 08:02.781
like, shaken down.

08:06.553 --> 08:08.520
Anna, what's your biggest worry?

08:08.589 --> 08:11.389
ANNA: The problem here is that
we afraid that the brothers,

08:11.458 --> 08:13.158
they're gonna screw us,
you know?

08:13.227 --> 08:14.993
Because we don't trust them
at all

08:15.062 --> 08:17.829
because they think that they
deserve stock in the company,

08:17.898 --> 08:19.130
that this is
their birth right.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.165
LEMONIS: They deserve
in stock in the factory.

08:20.234 --> 08:21.967
ANNA: No, in Susana Monaco.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.235
LEMONIS: Why would
they deserve stock here?

08:23.303 --> 08:25.136
ANNA: Well, good question.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.338
LEMONIS: Now,
are you with partners

08:26.406 --> 08:28.306
with Susana in this business?
ANNA: No.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.042
And the thing is that
it's really upsetting me,

08:31.111 --> 08:32.811
because I think
it should be 50/50

08:32.880 --> 08:36.114
because I carry a lot of stuff.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.315
LEMONIS: You get paid
as well or no?

08:37.384 --> 08:38.549
ANNA: Yes.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.184
LEMONIS: You do get paid.
ANNA: Yes.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.253
LEMONIS: Similar to what
Susana makes?

08:41.321 --> 08:42.520
ANNA: No, I'm paid more.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.422
Her salary is $100,000.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.690
My salary is $175,000.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.759
I feel why should I cut
my salary

08:47.828 --> 08:49.060
when I'm doing all the work,

08:49.129 --> 08:50.462
and I don't have
partnership papers?

08:50.531 --> 08:51.763
And I said that
to her straight out.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.266
I said, "It's one thing
if I have 50/50."

08:54.334 --> 08:57.402
But now, I... I mean,
technically, I'm an employee.

08:57.471 --> 09:01.039
LEMONIS: So Anna either gets
twice as much as Susana makes

09:01.108 --> 09:03.542
or she gets half the company?

09:03.610 --> 09:05.911
It feels like Susana is
being run into the ground

09:05.979 --> 09:07.178
all over the place.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.347
Her family wants
a piece of the business.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.716
Her employees want
a piece of the business.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.051
It's ridiculous.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.987
What's your biggest concern
about the business?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.989
ANNA: Well, biggest concern
is, of course,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.558
we're not making money.

09:19.626 --> 09:22.727
I mean, honestly we didn't make
any money since 2009, so...

09:22.796 --> 09:24.095
LEMONIS: No money.
ANNA: Yes.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.031
There's no cash flow
in the company.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.400
So what happens
is we ship in the world,

09:28.468 --> 09:30.468
we ship in the world,
there is no cash,

09:30.537 --> 09:32.237
so this is super stressful.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.175
LEMONIS: So, you know, when I
met with Anna individually,

09:37.244 --> 09:40.278
she told me she thought she
should own 50% of the company.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.680
SUSANA: Yes.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.549
She's making a lot
of decisions here.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.852
I'm not, you know, the pit bull.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.921
She's the pit bull.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.590
I need a pit bull.
LEMONIS: Yeah, but your pit bull

09:51.658 --> 09:53.325
isn't supposed to bite you.
SUSANA: No.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.894
LEMONIS: They're supposed
to protect you.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.629
SUSANA: Yeah, but...
LEMONIS: The purpose of a person

09:57.698 --> 09:59.264
like that is
to protect you and...

09:59.333 --> 10:01.399
SUSANA: Yes, but she does
in every other sense.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.968
It's not about bullying,
it's about...

10:03.036 --> 10:04.269
LEMONIS: But I feel like you're
giving me a rationalization...

10:04.338 --> 10:05.704
SUSANA: I'm not rationalizing,
it's the reason.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.038
LEMONIS: ...of why you let her
behave that way, though.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.207
Even when we're talking,
she always talks over you.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.542
She's not gonna take
a cut in pay

10:10.611 --> 10:12.177
and she wants 50%
of the business.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.113
It's like, "Okay, okay, hey,
just slow the [BLEEP] down."

10:15.182 --> 10:17.048
SUSANA: I just... I don't know
how I feel about that.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.151
It's a very,
very mixed-feeling thing.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.587
LEMONIS: What I want to do
is I'd like to have you

10:22.656 --> 10:25.223
bring your financials with you
and I want to go to the factory.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.167
Holy cow.
This place is huge.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.936
All these people work for you?

10:38.005 --> 10:40.271
This is gigantic.
SUSANA: Yeah.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.241
MARIO: Susana.
SUSANA: Hi, pop.

10:43.310 --> 10:47.145
MARIO: Please,
go punch the timecard.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.580
SUSANA:
This is my father, Mario.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.216
LEMONIS: Mario, how are you,
sir? I'm Marcus.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.752
You have a wonderful daughter.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.220
A lot of...
How many people work here?

10:55.288 --> 10:56.821
MARIO: Maybe 85, 90.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.591
LEMONIS: Wow.
Can I have a tour?

10:59.660 --> 11:00.992
MARIO: Okay.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.060
LEMONIS: All right, let's go.
Let's take a tour.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.434
How many pieces a year
come out of here?

11:09.503 --> 11:12.037
SUSANA: With us,
it's about 75,000.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.941
LEMONIS: Holy [BLEEP]
SUSANA: Yep.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.043
LEMONIS: What is all this?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.411
SUSANA: This is just
old inventory.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.880
LEMONIS: So does all this
inventory sit on your books?

11:21.948 --> 11:24.249
MARIO: Look how much stuff
she's got around here.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.419
SUSANA: Yeah, but it's...
it's not a lot.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.787
LEMONIS: I'm sorry?
SUSANA: Well...

11:28.855 --> 11:30.455
LEMONIS:
I already knew from the showroom

11:30.524 --> 11:32.457
that their collection
was all over the place.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.260
But this,
there is product everywhere,

11:35.328 --> 11:37.529
rejected by customers.

11:37.597 --> 11:40.465
Were you drunk or something
when you did this?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.267
This is what happens
when you don't have

11:42.335 --> 11:44.402
a clear focus
on your core product.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.807
MARIO: In each department,
we have a foreman.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.209
In the cutting department,
we have a foreman.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.712
LEMONIS: Where are your boys at?
They off today?

11:53.780 --> 11:55.547
MARIO: Uh, no,
they're budging around.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.082
I don't know.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.884
They're very... very busy.
LEMONIS: I'd like to meet them.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.120
Can you take me to them?
MARIO: Uh, you know what?

12:02.189 --> 12:04.022
SUSANA: I already know
what's going on here.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.858
The brothers think
I owe them their birth right.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.693
LEMONIS: So neither of them
will talk to me.

12:08.762 --> 12:09.828
SUSANA: No.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.329
MARIO: Supposed to be
equal partnership.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.198
LEMONIS: And so, the only way
that they would agree to meet me

12:13.266 --> 12:16.601
is if Susana gave away
two-thirds of the company?

12:16.670 --> 12:18.870
MARIO: Well, originally,
it's what you're supposed to do.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.371
LEMONIS:
Whose business is it?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.140
Who's selling?
Who's designing?

12:22.209 --> 12:23.174
The boys are designing?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.175
MARIO:
Well, it's not the point.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.380
SUSANA: They think that I
owe them more than I owe them.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.549
They... There's no respect
here for me at all.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.351
There's no respect.
Where's the respect?

12:33.420 --> 12:34.686
And what did I do?

12:34.755 --> 12:37.288
I created a business,
made a lot of jobs,

12:37.357 --> 12:38.690
and now everybody hates me.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.092
I'm never gonna be
in business with them again.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.428
And I'm not gonna have them
as my brothers,

12:43.497 --> 12:44.729
because this is bull[BLEEP]

12:44.798 --> 12:47.031
It's [BLEEP] total bull[BLEEP]

12:48.668 --> 12:50.068
Excuse me.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.539
LEMONIS: You got to get
those boys down here.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.142
Go ask them one time.
MARIO: I already asked them.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.511
LEMONIS: One time.
One time. For me.

12:59.579 --> 13:00.612
Just... You know,
I won't go up there.

13:00.680 --> 13:01.880
You go ask them one more time.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.348
There's a very simple reason

13:03.416 --> 13:05.984
that I'm asking Mario
to bring his sons down.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.852
If I'm gonna be
in business here

13:07.921 --> 13:09.220
and I'm gonna have
all the products made here,

13:09.289 --> 13:11.623
it's not unreasonable
that I want to meet them.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.292
MARIO: Mario left.
Dominic, he said, "No."

13:14.361 --> 13:15.460
He don't want to come down.

13:15.529 --> 13:16.828
LEMONIS: Mario left?
MARIO: Yeah.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.396
LEMONIS: Okay.
And Dominic said "no."

13:18.465 --> 13:19.998
MARIO: No.
LEMONIS: Wow.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.368
Look, it's clear to me that
the situation here is not ideal.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.370
The dynamics are really off.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.672
And if I'm gonna
move forward with Susana,

13:27.741 --> 13:30.241
I'm gonna have to put
a lot more thought into it.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.976
But before any of that happens,

13:32.045 --> 13:34.612
I have to dig in and see
if there's anything even here.

13:34.681 --> 13:35.713
Did you bring your
financials with you?

13:35.782 --> 13:37.282
SUSANA: Yes.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.851
LEMONIS: Why don't we sit down
and go over them and we'll see?

13:45.792 --> 13:48.960
Okay.
Start with the balance sheet.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.663
So $545,000 of inventory?
SUSANA: Yes.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.198
LEMONIS: All right,
so you could liquidate all that

13:53.266 --> 13:55.033
and generate some cash.
SUSANA: Yes.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.601
LEMONIS: How much debt
is in the business?

13:56.670 --> 13:57.802
ANNA: Just the payables.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.003
LEMONIS: Are there
any bank loans?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.438
ANNA: We don't have
any bank loans.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.407
LEMONIS: So the accounts
payable are the real problem?

14:02.475 --> 14:03.908
ANNA: Yes.
SUSANA: Yes.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.311
LEMONIS: And that's $719,000.
ANNA: Yes.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.546
LEMONIS: So $545,000
of inventory,

14:08.615 --> 14:10.348
$700,000 of debt.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.817
So how much of this
$700,000 is a problem?

14:12.886 --> 14:14.919
ANNA: I would say
half a million.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.054
LEMONIS: Is a problem.
ANNA: Yeah.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.422
LEMONIS: So if
your payables are paid

14:17.490 --> 14:19.424
and all you're doing
is selling the inventory,

14:19.492 --> 14:21.125
you're gonna have
a lot of cash coming in.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.260
ANNA: Yes.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.595
LEMONIS: Let's look
at the revenue.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.831
So last year,
$6.5 million in business.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.200
Gross profit of $2.6 million,

14:29.269 --> 14:31.870
which is less than 50%
and not good.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.705
$3,000,000 in expenses,

14:33.773 --> 14:36.941
and the business lost $361,000.

14:37.010 --> 14:40.745
If the margins were just what
they should have been at 50%,

14:40.814 --> 14:44.916
it would have been
$3,250,000 in gross profit,

14:44.985 --> 14:47.552
a difference of $650,000.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.854
Instead of losing $361,000,

14:49.923 --> 14:51.656
you would have made
a couple hundred.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.692
'Cause $6 million
in business, that's a lot.

14:54.761 --> 14:58.496
This is a margin game.
Make a good product.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.265
Have a good supply chain.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.233
Have good margins.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.668
Control your expenses.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.570
Survive.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.205
I have enough
financial information

15:07.274 --> 15:09.140
to at least understand
it better.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.110
And maybe you and I
can get together tomorrow.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.612
Thank you very much.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.387
Okay.
Let's go forward.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.655
The financial statement,

15:23.723 --> 15:26.424
last year the company
lost $361,000.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.393
That's a lot.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.194
Some of that is attributable

15:30.263 --> 15:32.130
to the fact
that you had low margins.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.632
What I like about the company

15:34.701 --> 15:36.768
is that the primary product,

15:36.836 --> 15:39.671
the supplex product,
is timeless.

15:39.739 --> 15:40.905
It works for everybody.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.442
So I'd like to make an offer.

15:44.511 --> 15:48.379
$600,000 for 50%
of the business.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.848
It pays all the bills,
it brings the vendors current,

15:50.917 --> 15:53.051
we get back to producing,
we get back to selling.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.852
With a lot of inventory

15:54.921 --> 15:56.287
where you can have enough

15:56.356 --> 15:58.589
working capital
to do sampling

15:58.658 --> 16:00.725
and product testing
and trunk shows.

16:00.794 --> 16:04.462
And we're moving
down the road, okay?

16:04.531 --> 16:08.333
SUSANA: I am not
sure how I feel.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.602
I need to know how Anna's going
to be played into this,

16:11.671 --> 16:13.338
because she's a really,

16:13.406 --> 16:15.707
really important part
of this component.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.742
LEMONIS: She's not gonna get
50% of the business,

16:17.811 --> 16:19.243
like she thinks
she's entitled to.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.244
That's never happening.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.314
SUSANA: Oh, my God, no.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.582
It's gonna be bad.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.285
I think this is gonna
be a problem with her.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.687
LEMONIS: Then she can quit.
SUSANA: Oh.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.862
ANNA: Unlike you,
respect means more to me

16:37.931 --> 16:39.163
than money,
than anything else.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.198
You know what I'm saying?

16:40.266 --> 16:41.733
I want to see you
in my position.

16:41.801 --> 16:42.900
SUSANA: I'm already
in your position.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.235
ANNA: I don't think so.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.536
LEMONIS: You are not
the owner of this business.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.572
ANNA: I didn't say
I was the owner.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.441
LEMONIS: And your behavior
is unacceptable.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.144
SUSANA: I need to know

16:53.213 --> 16:54.812
how Anna's gonna be
played into this.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.614
LEMONIS: She's not gonna
get 50% of the business.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.750
SUSANA: Oh, my God, no.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.952
I think this is
gonna be a problem.

17:01.021 --> 17:03.221
LEMONIS: Then she can quit.
SUSANA: Oh, my God.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.690
LEMONIS: Because she gets paid
almost double what you get paid.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.724
SUSANA: Yes, I know, but...
I know.

17:07.794 --> 17:08.893
LEMONIS: We got to
take these steps.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.395
We have to solve
the first problem

17:10.463 --> 17:12.296
before we can solve the second.

17:12.365 --> 17:17.300
So, $600,000 for 50%
of the busins.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.204
SUSANA: I mean,
this sounds like a...

17:20.272 --> 17:21.305
a great opportunity.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.741
LEMONIS: And you got
the talent for it.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.609
And I have
the distribution for it.

17:28.615 --> 17:31.082
You know that I'm 100%
in charge, right?

17:31.151 --> 17:33.284
SUSANA: Yes.
LEMONIS: Do we have a deal?

17:33.353 --> 17:34.285
SUSANA: Yes.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.788
Okay.

17:40.794 --> 17:43.294
LEMONIS: Hey, guys, we're gonna
have an employee meeting.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.097
Yesterday, I made a deal

17:46.166 --> 17:51.402
to invest $600,000
into this company.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.571
The money's gonna
pay the bills,

17:53.640 --> 17:56.074
and we're gonna invest
in product development.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.142
And then we're gonna look
at our business model.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.412
The goal is to shrink the line
and get rid of the things

18:01.481 --> 18:04.549
that don't sell and get out
of the business of losing money.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.051
Even though there are issues
with Susana's brothers,

18:07.120 --> 18:08.786
I've decided to stick
with the factory,

18:08.855 --> 18:10.755
because I want
as little disruption

18:10.824 --> 18:13.091
with the manufacturing
process as possible.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.060
And while the brothers are
still refusing to meet with me,

18:16.129 --> 18:18.129
they're at least
staying out of the way.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.932
It's the father's factory,
and he and Susana seem

18:21.000 --> 18:22.667
to have a really good
working relationship.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.569
So that's good enough for me.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.337
It's important
for everybody to know

18:26.406 --> 18:28.439
that there's
a bright future ahead

18:28.508 --> 18:30.374
and that we're here to save jobs

18:30.443 --> 18:31.843
and make more money.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.678
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

18:33.746 --> 18:36.047
All right, let's go to work.
Thank you.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.185
So let's think about this
for just a moment.

18:41.254 --> 18:44.555
If I wanted to see the entire
Susana Monaco collection...

18:44.624 --> 18:45.890
SUSANA: Oh, there's
thousands and thousands.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.592
LEMONIS: There's thousands?
SUSANA: Thousands.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.528
LEMONIS: I already know that
Susana's collection lacks focus,

18:50.597 --> 18:52.530
but before I work on that,
I want to look at

18:52.599 --> 18:54.732
how Susana manages
her inventory,

18:54.801 --> 18:56.534
how the retailers order product,

18:56.603 --> 18:58.970
and how the company
actually fulfills those orders.

18:59.038 --> 19:02.473
If there are inefficiencies
in any of those processes,

19:02.542 --> 19:04.675
that could explain
why the margins are low.

19:04.744 --> 19:09.147
So where can I see one finished
garment of every style...

19:09.215 --> 19:11.816
SUSANA: Most of them would be
in the showroom right now.

19:11.885 --> 19:14.385
ANNA: Yes. Whatever's
finished is packed immediately

19:14.454 --> 19:15.853
and gets shipped
to the customer.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.155
SUSANA: Is sold. And shipped.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.422
And they wait till
last minute to place orders.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.557
ANNA: Yes, exactly.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.591
Everybody's waiting
the last minute

19:20.660 --> 19:21.926
to place orders
because we know...

19:21.995 --> 19:23.427
They know...
SUSANA: They can get it.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.764
ANNA: But at the same time,
us as a company, it's very hard.

19:26.833 --> 19:27.999
LEMONIS: You can't forecast.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.534
ANNA: Exactly.
SUSANA: No, no forecasting.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.569
ANNA: We sitting there, like,
"Are we gonna get the dollars,

19:31.638 --> 19:32.737
because they're not prebooked?"

19:32.805 --> 19:34.238
LEMONIS: You don't know.
That's the worry.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.806
ANNA: Yes.
LEMONIS: And so this garment,

19:35.875 --> 19:37.975
I can get this on-demand
in two weeks?

19:38.044 --> 19:39.810
SUSANA: Mm-hmm.
LEMONIS: What is my price

19:39.879 --> 19:41.712
if I pre-buy it
three months before?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.181
ANNA: It's the same.
LEMONIS: It's the same.

19:43.249 --> 19:46.651
So why would I...
Why would I do it?

19:46.719 --> 19:48.953
What you could do is you could
build a pricing model

19:49.022 --> 19:51.155
that would incentivise them

19:51.224 --> 19:53.424
to pre-order versus
order on demand.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.060
We're gonna create
three pricing strategies.

19:56.129 --> 19:58.663
Quick ship will have one price,
pre-buy will have a price,

19:58.731 --> 20:01.766
and then custom is gonna have
a slightly elevated price.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.768
Moving forward, we're gonna
offer our retailers

20:03.836 --> 20:05.603
three ways
to order products,

20:05.672 --> 20:07.605
thus eliminating inefficiencies,

20:07.674 --> 20:09.173
improving margins,

20:09.242 --> 20:10.675
and improving cash flow.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.878
First we're gonna give buyers
a way to pre-order product,

20:13.947 --> 20:16.080
allowing us to buy
fabric in advance,

20:16.149 --> 20:17.281
lowering our costs,

20:17.350 --> 20:18.616
and giving predictability

20:18.685 --> 20:20.218
to our manufacturing process.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.954
Secondly, we're going
to have a quick ship line.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.189
That will allow retailers
to order product

20:25.258 --> 20:28.426
that's already in stock,
improving our cash flow.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.695
Third, there's
custom on demand,

20:30.763 --> 20:33.464
the historical way
Susana sold products,

20:33.533 --> 20:35.566
but they'll pay
a small premium for it.

20:35.635 --> 20:38.436
Now we just need to decide
what products we're offering.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.705
I want you guys to pick the top

20:40.773 --> 20:43.140
100 best-selling styles.
ANNA: Yeah.

20:43.209 --> 20:44.675
LEMONIS:
And then once we do that,

20:44.744 --> 20:46.644
we're gonna narrow
the whole line down to 30.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.446
We're gonna produce it
and we're gonna stock it

20:48.514 --> 20:50.381
and we're going
to sell quick ship.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.582
ANNA: No.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.621
LEMONIS: Why do you...

20:56.689 --> 20:58.189
Why do you not like
shipping quick ship?

20:58.258 --> 20:59.957
ANNA: Yeah, but what
if it doesn't sell?

21:00.026 --> 21:02.760
LEMONIS: If it doesn't sell,
then we liquidate it.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.362
You okay, Anna?

21:04.430 --> 21:05.596
ANNA: I need to step out.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.266
You can sit here.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.301
LEMONIS: All of a sudden,
Anna just darts off

21:10.370 --> 21:12.637
and Susana goes
scurrying after her.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.339
And before I know it,
they're just arguing.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.507
ANNA:
That's [BLEEP] [BLEEP]

21:16.576 --> 21:17.808
I'm always getting
pushed to the side.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.010
SUSANA: You're not getting
pushed to the side.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.344
ANNA: I just did.
SUSANA: Can you please...

21:20.413 --> 21:21.712
ANNA: The problem with me
is that I need to respect,

21:21.781 --> 21:22.847
which I don't see.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.348
LEMONIS: I was like,
"Wait a minute.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.984
I thought we were just talking
about inventory here, guys."

21:27.053 --> 21:28.719
What's the issue with Anna?

21:28.788 --> 21:32.056
SUSANA: She wasn't given
any type of recognition.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.892
I think she... I think she
should get recognition.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.727
LEMONIS: What's the recognition
she should get?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.195
She makes more
than everybody else.

21:38.264 --> 21:40.264
You are the owner
of the company.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.899
You got to have a backbone.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.768
Is that hard for you?

21:43.836 --> 21:44.669
SUSANA: Yeah.
LEMONIS: Why?

21:44.737 --> 21:45.936
SUSANA: It is.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.571
Because I've never put myself
front and center.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.773
LEMONIS: Why?

21:48.841 --> 21:50.708
SUSANA: Being beat down
from, you know...

21:50.777 --> 21:52.143
LEMONIS: Who?
SUSANA: Anna.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.245
I'm just saying, just the
acknowledgement and, you know...

21:54.314 --> 21:56.113
LEMONIS: This is not your
issue. This is her issue,

21:56.182 --> 21:57.715
and you're being
her mouthpiece right now.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.850
Let's grab her
and I'll meet you up there.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.452
SUSANA: All right.

22:01.521 --> 22:04.655
ANNA: I don't have to comply
to this abuse anymore.

22:04.724 --> 22:05.556
SUSANA: Nobody abused,
nobody said anything.

22:05.625 --> 22:06.824
ANNA: Yes, it is.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.192
SUSANA: What do you think
that is gonna happen now?

22:08.261 --> 22:09.660
ANNA: You always need
to stand up before anything.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.796
SUSANA: I don't understand
what your point is.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.731
ANNA: Respect means more to me
than money, than anything else.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.199
You know what I'm saying?

22:15.268 --> 22:17.435
I was busting my balls
for 11 years

22:17.503 --> 22:20.371
to get this business up,
without staff, by myself,

22:20.440 --> 22:23.074
working to 12:00 midnight.
I'm working all weekends.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.375
The minute I get home,
I'm working,

22:24.444 --> 22:25.710
because it's 12 hours
difference.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.411
LEMONIS: You are not
the owner of this business.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.746
ANNA: I didn't say
I was the owner.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.915
LEMONIS: And your behavior
is unacceptable.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.319
I'd like you to go inside.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.621
This is gonna be about
putting you in the forefront.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.123
SUSANA:
This is very difficult.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.792
It's really stressful to...
to...

22:43.896 --> 22:45.596
LEMONIS: You are not
the owner of this business.

22:45.665 --> 22:46.764
ANNA: I didn't say
I was the owner.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.699
LEMONIS: And your behavior
is unacceptable.

22:48.768 --> 22:49.734
ANNA: Oh, really?

22:49.802 --> 22:51.302
LEMONIS: Anna is
demanding respect,

22:51.371 --> 22:52.870
which in my opinion is code for,

22:52.939 --> 22:55.139
"Hey, Susana,
give me half the business."

22:55.208 --> 22:56.874
Well, that isn't
gonna happen.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.342
MARIO: That's terrible.

22:58.411 --> 23:00.311
LEMONIS: I'm appreciative
of Anna's work,

23:00.380 --> 23:03.013
but this attitude
is not gonna fly with me.

23:03.082 --> 23:06.016
I think going forward in order
for all of this to work,

23:06.085 --> 23:08.219
everybody's got to be treated
with respect.

23:08.287 --> 23:09.387
Everybody.

23:09.455 --> 23:10.554
And so, we're gonna
stick together

23:10.623 --> 23:13.057
and we're gonna move forward.

23:19.499 --> 23:23.300
This was the task of coming up
with 100 best-selling styles.

23:23.369 --> 23:24.902
I actually want to build
a core catalog,

23:24.971 --> 23:26.937
so how many pieces
are actually here roughly?

23:27.006 --> 23:29.206
SUSANA: 70.
LEMONIS: 70.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.675
So, Susana, why
isn't there 100 here?

23:31.744 --> 23:34.979
SUSANA: We...
We just were not talking.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.680
ANNA: I just wasn't
talking to her. Not talking.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.048
SUSANA: She wasn't
involved yesterday.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.251
LEMONIS: So you had to handle
this on your own,

23:40.319 --> 23:41.652
and we ended up with this.
SUSANA: Yeah. Yeah.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.788
LEMONIS: Are you guys
talking now?

23:43.856 --> 23:45.723
SUSANA: We just started,
like, this moment.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.958
LEMONIS: Right now?
SUSANA: Yeah.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.194
ANNA: Yep. Mm-hmm.
LEMONIS: Okay.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.430
STEPHANIE: Hi.
LEMONIS: Hey.

23:52.498 --> 23:53.397
STEPHANIE:
How you doing, Marcus?

23:53.466 --> 23:54.698
LEMONIS: This is Stephanie.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.400
STEPHANIE: Hi, Stephanie Menkin.
Nice to meet you.

23:56.469 --> 23:57.601
ANNA: Hi. Anna.
Nice to meet you.

23:57.670 --> 23:58.969
LEMONIS:
Stephanie is a woman

23:59.038 --> 24:00.971
that I partnered
with a couple of years ago.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.507
She was one of the original
owners of Courage B.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.943
And she runs my entire
fashion group.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.945
She's gonna be
very involved in the process

24:08.014 --> 24:09.747
not only today,
but going forward.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.482
So let's clear the back
wall and let's...

24:11.551 --> 24:12.783
Let's move the process along.

24:12.852 --> 24:15.052
SUSANA: All right.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.253
LEMONIS: This is what we know

24:16.322 --> 24:17.721
as the best-selling unit
in the company,

24:17.790 --> 24:19.256
and the best-selling unit
is black.

24:19.325 --> 24:21.091
Next the tube top.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.960
This is like one of
your best sellers ever, right?

24:23.029 --> 24:24.128
SUSANA: Yes.
STEPHANIE: Great.

24:24.197 --> 24:25.329
LEMONIS: How many units
did you sell?

24:25.398 --> 24:26.497
STEPHANIE: Almost 3,000.
LEMONIS: 3,000.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.765
ANNA: And everybody's
retailing this.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.033
LEMONIS: Ultimately,
the products

24:29.101 --> 24:30.468
that we choose here today

24:30.536 --> 24:32.803
will build a collection
of core products.

24:32.872 --> 24:33.971
STEPHANIE: Fantastic.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.172
SUSANA: Yeah.
STEPHANIE: Great basic.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.640
LEMONIS: And this'll give us
a clear way

24:36.709 --> 24:38.943
to have products
at a great price

24:39.011 --> 24:40.377
and always in stock.

24:40.446 --> 24:42.012
Quick ship?
STEPHANIE: How does this sell?

24:42.081 --> 24:43.581
ANNA: It's not great.
STEPHANIE: No.

24:43.649 --> 24:44.782
LEMONIS: Quick ship?
STEPHANIE: Yep.

24:44.851 --> 24:45.916
LEMONIS: All right.
STEPHANIE: No doubt.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.518
LEMONIS: We're gonna
finish the pool,

24:47.587 --> 24:49.019
and we're gonna look
at what our margins

24:49.088 --> 24:50.521
have to be
and we're gonna figure out

24:50.590 --> 24:52.890
how we're gonna get
these made at these prices.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.359
So you guys go through
all these and keep sorting,

24:55.428 --> 24:56.627
and I'll be back.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.802
LEMONIS: Good morning.
SUSANA: Good morning.

25:04.871 --> 25:07.271
LEMONIS: So I want to really
spend more time thinking

25:07.340 --> 25:09.840
about the quality of the fabrics

25:09.909 --> 25:11.342
and amping up the details.

25:11.410 --> 25:14.712
Today I'm taking Anna and Susana
to Premiere Vision in New York,

25:14.780 --> 25:17.248
a global fabric expo
where manufacturers

25:17.316 --> 25:19.083
come from all over the world.

25:19.151 --> 25:22.086
It's a great place to negotiate
directly with vendors

25:22.154 --> 25:24.321
and find fantastic fabrics.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.423
This is nice.
It's got a lot of stretch.

25:26.492 --> 25:28.292
SUSANA: Yes.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.160
I love Japanese fabrics.
I really do.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.929
LEMONIS:
This is really pretty.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.131
Can we get a sample of these?
WOMAN: Sure, of course.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.833
LEMONIS: Okay, and what's
the price per yard?

25:35.902 --> 25:38.936
WOMAN: This one is
about $6 to $7.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.771
LEMONIS: Okay.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.874
SUSANA: When you make these
in dresses, it fits really well.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.876
LEMONIS: Are all these
fabrics synthetic?

25:45.945 --> 25:46.911
MAN: Yeah.

25:46.979 --> 25:47.945
LEMONIS: Typically price
per yard?

25:48.014 --> 25:48.812
MAN: $10.

25:48.881 --> 25:49.880
LEMONIS: $10?
MAN: Yeah.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.682
ANNA: Plus they're
too expensive.

25:51.751 --> 25:54.752
SUSANA: The conversation always
is, "We can't afford it."

25:54.820 --> 25:56.086
Never? Really?

25:56.155 --> 25:57.621
ANNA: Some stuff
is too expensive.

25:57.690 --> 26:00.257
SUSANA: All the time,
fabric costs are too expensive.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.192
ANNA: Yes, because you look
at fabrics like $20 a yard.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.727
SUSANA: No, it's not $20 a yard.
ANNA: Yes.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.829
SUSANA: She dismisses every
single thing that I ever tried.

26:05.898 --> 26:09.767
I get so excited,
and then I go, "Can't use.

26:09.835 --> 26:11.969
Can't use. Can't use.
Can't use."

26:12.038 --> 26:13.304
And now I have to re-design

26:13.372 --> 26:15.739
and really pull out
some magic out of nothing.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.041
That's not where it started.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.043
That's not where
the joy starts.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.411
I've lost my feel

26:20.479 --> 26:22.846
to do beautiful things,
you know what I'm saying?

26:22.915 --> 26:24.682
LEMONIS: I can't fault
Anna for always

26:24.750 --> 26:26.050
trying to improve margins

26:26.118 --> 26:28.152
and drive down costs.
That's her job.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.520
But it's also her job

26:29.589 --> 26:31.956
to help Susana bring
her visions to life.

26:32.024 --> 26:34.124
And I'm not sure
she's always on the same page.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.461
I can see Susana's point
that you are aggressive.

26:37.530 --> 26:39.496
ANNA: You are also
very aggressive, by the way.

26:39.565 --> 26:41.165
LEMONIS: I'm aggressive 'cause I
want to sell some [BLEEP]

26:41.233 --> 26:42.900
I want to make money.
ANNA: Yes, me too.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.268
LEMONIS: And I want
the clothes to be right

26:44.337 --> 26:45.569
with the right fabrics.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.671
And so we're gonna build
an infrastructure

26:47.740 --> 26:49.139
so there's less crisis.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.610
This company is never gonna
succeed if Susana feels stymied,

26:52.678 --> 26:54.011
like she can't afford
the fabrics

26:54.080 --> 26:55.546
that she really, really wants.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.581
Well, never again
is that gonna happen.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.283
Can we get these?
WOMAN: Sure, of course.

26:59.352 --> 27:00.618
LEMONIS: And you want
these as well?

27:00.686 --> 27:01.952
SUSANA: Yeah.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.153
LEMONIS: The money
I'm investing in this business

27:03.222 --> 27:05.222
is gonna go
into resources, like fabric.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.257
We're gonna buy in bulk
and lower our costs

27:07.326 --> 27:08.959
and ultimately save money

27:09.028 --> 27:11.261
and give her the products
that she wants to be creative.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.831
Design what you love without

27:13.899 --> 27:15.299
compromising too much quality.
SUSANA: Mm-hmm.

27:15.368 --> 27:16.300
LEMONIS: I want her
to love everything.

27:16.369 --> 27:17.401
ANNA: It's not... yes.

27:17.470 --> 27:18.369
SUSANA: I want
to love everything.

27:18.437 --> 27:19.637
LEMONIS: So do you.
ANNA: Yes.

27:19.705 --> 27:20.504
LEMONIS: Can we go look
at some other stuff?

27:20.573 --> 27:22.239
Oh, I need to find some zippers.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.948
Today I'm gonna hold
the liquidation soon,

27:31.017 --> 27:32.549
and I have two goals...

27:32.618 --> 27:35.853
clear all this dead inventory so
that we can get some cash back,

27:35.921 --> 27:37.721
but also make room
in the warehouse

27:37.790 --> 27:39.823
for the core collection
that we're establishing.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.358
Let's just get this stuff out.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.027
There's some dresses.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.528
But more importantly,

27:44.597 --> 27:48.298
I want Susana to stay front
and center with new customers

27:48.367 --> 27:51.068
getting to know her brand.

27:51.137 --> 27:52.636
Okay.
SUSANA: Okay.

27:52.705 --> 27:54.805
I really don't want to go in...
LEMONIS: Why's that?

27:54.874 --> 27:56.907
SUSANA: ...to the store.
Because when I'm designing,

27:56.976 --> 27:59.877
I'm trying to be in
the creative bubble right now.

27:59.945 --> 28:02.246
LEMONIS: Are you designing
right now at 4:00?

28:02.314 --> 28:03.514
SUSANA: No.

28:03.582 --> 28:04.982
LEMONIS: Anna, can I spend
a minute with Susana?

28:05.051 --> 28:06.350
ANNA: All right.

28:06.419 --> 28:08.152
LEMONIS: I know
it's a big deal for you,

28:08.220 --> 28:10.654
but this is the last thing
you got to get over.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.022
Here we go.
Say "hi" to this woman.

28:12.091 --> 28:12.990
Hi, there, ma'am.
SUSANA: Hi.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.525
WOMAN: Hi.
SUSANA: How are you?

28:14.593 --> 28:16.326
LEMONIS: This is
Susana Monaco, the designer.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.062
She's having her sample sell.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.296
Honestly, if you
take two minutes

28:19.365 --> 28:21.799
and let her just show
you the product.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.033
How are you, ma'am?

28:23.102 --> 28:25.536
We're having
a sample sale, 90% off.

28:25.604 --> 28:26.770
WOMAN: What's the name
of the company?

28:26.839 --> 28:28.138
SUSANA: Susana Monaco
is the company name.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.707
WOMAN: Is that you?

28:29.775 --> 28:31.875
SUSANA: Yes, that's me.

28:31.944 --> 28:35.579
There's a lot of cute stuff
here.

28:35.648 --> 28:37.314
We use a lot
of different styles.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.583
WOMAN: Okay, I'll look around.
SUSANA: Okay.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.589
I mean, this is hard.

28:45.658 --> 28:46.890
LEMONIS: What's
the real issue here?

28:46.959 --> 28:48.659
SUSANA: This is very difficult.
LEMONIS: Why?

28:48.728 --> 28:49.960
SUSANA: To deal with.

28:50.029 --> 28:53.163
You know?

28:53.232 --> 28:54.898
You know, with all these years

28:54.967 --> 28:56.500
working under this
kind of stress.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.969
I mean, I... I don't know
if you believe it or not,

28:59.038 --> 29:01.038
but it's really stressful to...

29:05.878 --> 29:07.111
LEMONIS:
If your business is in trouble

29:07.179 --> 29:08.912
and you need my help,
log on to...

29:12.818 --> 29:14.017
LEMONIS:
What's the real issue here?

29:14.086 --> 29:16.620
SUSANA: This is very
difficult to deal with.

29:16.689 --> 29:18.322
You know, with all these years

29:18.390 --> 29:20.791
working under this kind
of stress, I mean, I...

29:20.860 --> 29:22.426
I don't know if you
believe it or not,

29:22.495 --> 29:24.528
but it's really stressful to...

29:28.768 --> 29:32.569
LEMONIS: Come on. Come on.
It's okay.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.941
SUSANA: I'm not used
to anybody being there.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.042
LEMONIS: But I'm here.
SUSANA: I know. I know.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.844
LEMONIS: That's why
you called me.

29:40.913 --> 29:43.847
And I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.049
Okay?
SUSANA: Yeah.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.519
LEMONIS: This is
the last hump in the road.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.954
So I'd like you to go inside,

29:51.023 --> 29:52.990
I'd like you to work with me,
let's get some people in.

29:53.058 --> 29:54.792
You're giving a lot of women
the opportunity

29:54.860 --> 29:56.393
to buy your product
that maybe normally

29:56.462 --> 29:58.262
they couldn't afford to.
SUSANA: Yeah. Yeah.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.396
LEMONIS: Think about
it that way.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.898
SUSANA: Yeah. Yeah.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.800
LEMONIS: I don't think Susana is
used to really being out front

30:02.868 --> 30:04.501
and having this be about her.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.303
Historically, it's been
about her family

30:06.372 --> 30:08.172
or Anna or everybody else.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.141
Well, this is the day that
Susana's gonna be out front,

30:11.210 --> 30:13.644
and she's gonna be proud
of what she's done.

30:13.712 --> 30:14.878
How are you folks?

30:14.947 --> 30:16.313
WOMAN: Good, how are you?
SUSANA: Hi.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.648
LEMONIS: Welcome, this is
Susana Monaco's sample sale.

30:17.716 --> 30:20.117
Can she show you some of
her stuff inside really quickly?

30:20.186 --> 30:21.885
WOMAN: Yes.
Absolutely.

30:21.954 --> 30:24.188
LEMONIS: How are you, ma'am?
We're having a sample sale.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.689
90% off.

30:25.758 --> 30:27.658
SUSANA: Like 50
or 60 designs, tops,

30:27.726 --> 30:29.293
and dresses generally.
WOMAN: Very cool.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.762
LEMONIS: Everything's
$20 inside and out.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.330
SUSANA: This is one
of my other favorite dresses.

30:33.399 --> 30:34.631
It's a fall dress.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.133
This is all our design.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.702
Everything is us.

30:38.771 --> 30:39.803
I'm the designer.

30:39.872 --> 30:42.339
WOMAN: Oh, nice to meet you.

30:42.408 --> 30:45.409
SUSANA: You're picking
very nice stuff.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.177
I'm glad you stopped by.
Thank you.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.545
Thank you.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.647
LEMONIS: Where you guys at,
about $38,000 for the day?

30:50.716 --> 30:51.982
MAN: Yeah, $38,000.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.283
SUSANA: It was a really
good turnout. Huge.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.618
LEMONIS: I'm going
to have them run this

30:54.687 --> 30:56.153
for a couple more days

30:56.222 --> 30:57.287
and my guess is that we clear
probably $100,000 out of here.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.223
SUSANA: Yeah.
I got to see how everyone

30:59.291 --> 31:01.291
was trying
on all the different products

31:01.360 --> 31:04.127
and seeing what people
were attracted to

31:04.196 --> 31:06.363
and hearing some old stories
about people

31:06.432 --> 31:09.066
who actually had been customers
for many, many years,

31:09.134 --> 31:10.667
which was a great thing.

31:10.736 --> 31:14.638
I'm more relaxed now.
I'm not crying now.

31:14.707 --> 31:16.974
It was great.
LEMONIS: Susana, good job.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.817
Morning.
ANNA: Hey, how are you?

31:26.886 --> 31:28.352
LEMONIS: Good, how are you?

31:28.420 --> 31:32.189
First thing I wanted to knock
out was the core products.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.258
Did you finalize
the final core pieces?

31:34.326 --> 31:35.425
SUSANA: Yes.

31:35.494 --> 31:36.560
LEMONIS: These are all
the best bodies.

31:36.629 --> 31:37.761
We have them in stock
at all times.

31:37.830 --> 31:39.029
SUSANA: Mm-hmm.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.197
LEMONIS: So that if you
get a rush-in order,

31:40.266 --> 31:42.599
it means it's actually
delivered, okay?

31:42.668 --> 31:44.268
ANNA: Okay.
LEMONIS: I feel really good

31:44.336 --> 31:46.803
about what was done
with the core collection.

31:46.872 --> 31:48.872
I'd like to actually
do a fashion show.

31:48.941 --> 31:51.241
I'm gonna invite journalists.
I'm gonna invite magazines.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.676
I'm gonna blow this thing up.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.544
Like any other
fashion company,

31:54.613 --> 31:56.647
in addition to
our core products,

31:56.715 --> 31:58.982
we're gonna have new products
that come out every season.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.351
So what I really
want Susana to do now

32:01.420 --> 32:04.087
is focus on next
Spring's collection.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.489
I've bought new fabric,

32:05.557 --> 32:06.723
and I want to have
a fashion show

32:06.792 --> 32:08.125
to create some buzz.

32:08.193 --> 32:10.294
This is gonna be about
putting you in the forefront.

32:10.362 --> 32:14.164
ANNA: I don't think that she
needs to be subjected to that,

32:14.233 --> 32:15.732
because there is
not enough time.

32:15.801 --> 32:18.302
And your problem is that you
never finish anything.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.737
LEMONIS: This is the moment
where the owner of the business,

32:20.806 --> 32:22.539
person with the name
on the wall,

32:22.608 --> 32:24.107
has to be crystal clear.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.510
SUSANA: Step off.
ANNA: Okay, but I do.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.679
My opinion is that she does not
express herself clearly.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.714
SUSANA: This I can't
deal with actually.

32:30.783 --> 32:32.049
That, you know, I don't...

32:32.117 --> 32:34.184
I'm not clearly representing
what I want to say.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.253
I don't like it.
I don't like it.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.422
Whether you think I, you know,

32:38.490 --> 32:41.258
can clearly represent myself
or express

32:41.327 --> 32:42.726
what I'm saying or not,
I don't care.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.528
This is bull[BLEEP]
ANNA: That's not bull[BLEEP]

32:44.596 --> 32:46.196
SUSANA: It's bull[BLEEP]
ANNA: No, it's not.

32:46.265 --> 32:47.798
LEMONIS: I was annoyed
that Anna continues

32:47.866 --> 32:51.568
to try to bully Susana around
and tell her what to do.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.370
There's nothing new about that.

32:53.439 --> 32:57.140
But what was new is that Susana
was standing up for herself.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.709
Now, that's progress.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.877
I think you have to try
to be more helpful

33:00.946 --> 33:03.146
in pushing her to the forefront.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.848
ANNA: Some things
I disagree with you.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.283
I think that like I said
to you...

33:06.352 --> 33:08.552
LEMONIS: Some things you
disagree with or most things?

33:08.620 --> 33:10.387
It's still Susana's business.

33:10.456 --> 33:12.122
That's still the name
of the company.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.724
ANNA: I talk over people,
but it's not on purpose.

33:13.792 --> 33:14.825
I'm not trying
to be disrespectful.

33:14.893 --> 33:16.226
You know what I mean,

33:16.295 --> 33:17.661
sometimes it's just like...
LEMONIS: Tell her that.

33:17.730 --> 33:18.829
ANNA: Yes, and she knows
that sometimes I have an idea

33:18.897 --> 33:20.330
and I just have
to say something.

33:20.399 --> 33:21.465
SUSANA: No, but it
is disrespectful.

33:21.533 --> 33:22.632
This is something
that you do all the time.

33:22.701 --> 33:23.734
ANNA: I'm sorry
it's disrespectful to you,

33:23.802 --> 33:25.302
but I did not mean
to be disrespectful.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.170
Maybe I can be more mindful
about it

33:27.239 --> 33:28.839
and change this, you know.

33:28.907 --> 33:32.142
LEMONIS: Okay, well,
should be a great show.

33:32.211 --> 33:36.013
So you need to get your head
around being at the front.

33:40.886 --> 33:42.519
With the core collection
finalized,

33:42.588 --> 33:44.988
we're heading into production
to build the inventory

33:45.057 --> 33:46.256
so that retailers

33:46.325 --> 33:48.058
can get those items
all year long.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.259
But more importantly,

33:49.328 --> 33:51.928
the fashion show
is quickly approaching.

33:51.997 --> 33:54.798
And what I want Susana to do
is to focus on that

33:54.867 --> 33:56.433
and getting
the Spring line done.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.068
Susana.
SUSANA: Hey, Marcus.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.569
How's it going?
LEMONIS: Good.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.972
I wanted to check in
on the drawings

34:02.041 --> 34:03.273
for the new collection.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.909
Have you historically
had products this long?

34:05.978 --> 34:08.911
SUSANA: Um, not generally.

34:08.981 --> 34:10.313
LEMONIS: But what
prompted you to do that?

34:10.382 --> 34:13.183
SUSANA: Because the fabric
has a really great drape.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.518
It's got a really great hand.
LEMONIS: Can you print some out,

34:15.587 --> 34:17.754
because I'd like to see
some of the colors.

34:17.822 --> 34:20.223
Susana spends a lot of time
and money

34:20.292 --> 34:21.792
printing out different designs,

34:21.860 --> 34:23.659
and so I went out and I
bought her a new Epson printer.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.027
It doesn't have a cartridge.

34:25.097 --> 34:27.496
And it's mobile. You can move it
all around the office.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.132
Not only is the color vibrant,

34:30.202 --> 34:31.635
but it also comes
with an eco-tank

34:31.703 --> 34:33.036
and up to two years'
worth of ink,

34:33.105 --> 34:34.504
so I'm not wasting
a ton of money.

34:34.572 --> 34:35.906
You know how you buy
a printer and you're like,

34:35.974 --> 34:38.175
"I spend more on cartridges
than I did the printer."

34:38.243 --> 34:39.376
SUSANA: The colors
came out really great,

34:39.445 --> 34:40.476
and it's fast, too.

34:40.545 --> 34:42.012
LEMONIS: I love it.
SUSANA: Yeah.

34:42.081 --> 34:45.081
LEMONIS: I thought the three
of us could just spend a minute

34:45.150 --> 34:47.317
chatting and find out
how things have been going.

34:47.386 --> 34:51.922
SUSANA: I want to be partners,
but not in the terms of her

34:51.989 --> 34:54.324
telling me
what to do in my own business.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.159
ANNA: I'm not bossing
anybody around,

34:56.228 --> 34:57.394
because it's her company.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.695
If it's her company and it means

34:58.764 --> 35:00.397
that she doesn't need
to produce line on time,

35:00.466 --> 35:01.698
that it bothers me,
you understand?

35:01.767 --> 35:03.667
If she doesn't like my opinion,
okay, fine, but...

35:03.735 --> 35:05.735
SUSANA: I don't like when you
have this impression,

35:05.804 --> 35:07.104
"Well, she..."

35:07.172 --> 35:08.805
This kind of sort of push me
on the side kind of thing.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.273
I don't like it.

35:10.342 --> 35:14.478
I have to be able to say
my opinion and say what I feel.

35:14.546 --> 35:17.547
I'm the owner of the company.
My name's on the door.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.683
LEMONIS: I just feel like this
is gonna continue for years.

35:19.751 --> 35:20.917
How does this resolve itself?

35:20.986 --> 35:22.385
SUSANA: I don't know.
LEMONIS: Do you want

35:22.454 --> 35:24.387
Anna to be part
of the company going forward?

35:24.456 --> 35:26.857
SUSANA: If there's a change.
If there's a change, yes.

35:26.925 --> 35:29.392
If there's not a change, then
we can, you know, part ways.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.895
ANNA: She cannot face
things by herself.

35:31.964 --> 35:33.163
SUSANA:
Can you please shut up?

35:33.232 --> 35:35.198
I just want to clean this up,
do you understand?

35:35.267 --> 35:37.534
ANNA: Instead of waiting for you
to say all those things

35:37.603 --> 35:39.269
she told me she wouldn't,
you know what I mean?

35:39.338 --> 35:40.370
She would have had
this conversation...

35:40.439 --> 35:41.671
SUSANA: 'Cause you know why?
I'm done.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.373
I'm done with this relationship,
how we work.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.574
I'm done with it.

35:47.412 --> 35:48.745
LEMONIS: This is a big night.
SUSANA: Yeah.

35:48.814 --> 35:49.946
LEMONIS: Have you seen
how many people are up there?

35:50.015 --> 35:51.781
SUSANA: No.
LEMONIS: "Allure's" there.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.518
"Vanity Fair's" there.
It's packed.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.123
ANNA: She cannot face
things by herself.

36:00.192 --> 36:01.458
She could not talk...

36:01.527 --> 36:02.459
SUSANA: What do you mean
face things by yourself?

36:02.528 --> 36:03.660
You know why?
I'm done.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.328
I'm done with this relationship,
how we work.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.796
I'm done with it.
LEMONIS: Do you guys

36:06.865 --> 36:09.332
realize that the two of you
really argue about nothing?

36:09.401 --> 36:11.735
ANNA: Sometimes, you know,
I can be aggressive,

36:11.803 --> 36:13.136
and I do get upset.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.138
SUSANA: I want it to work.
I've always wanted it to work,

36:15.207 --> 36:16.439
but there has to be
mutual respect.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.574
That's what needs to happen.

36:17.643 --> 36:18.842
LEMONIS: We have
a big presentation.

36:18.911 --> 36:20.177
I'm excited about it.

36:20.245 --> 36:21.945
I've spent a lot of money.

36:22.014 --> 36:24.814
Do you think you guys
can work together?

36:24.883 --> 36:26.149
SUSANA: I think
we can work together.

36:26.218 --> 36:29.085
LEMONIS: Do you think
you can work together?

36:29.154 --> 36:31.555
ANNA: Yep.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.827
LEMONIS: It's a busy time
at Susana Monaco.

36:37.896 --> 36:42.098
I've invested $100,000
into creating the new core line

36:42.167 --> 36:43.733
and building up the inventory.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.569
And in just a few days,
we're gonna be

36:45.637 --> 36:48.205
unveiling our new Spring line
at the fashion show.

36:48.273 --> 36:49.606
SUSANA: Oh, that's cute.
ANNA: Oh, that's cute.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.741
Very cute.
What do you think?

36:51.810 --> 36:53.877
LEMONIS: It needs to be clean,
but I actually like the fact

36:53.946 --> 36:55.345
that it's slightly frayed.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.580
I like the fact, Susana,

36:56.648 --> 36:57.948
that you put sheer
all the way around.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.449
It really makes it dressy.

36:59.518 --> 37:03.119
The outside fabric feels
just slightly too short.

37:03.188 --> 37:05.021
We're making improvements
overall.

37:05.090 --> 37:08.191
But most importantly, the line
is looking very promising.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.694
Fabric feels much better.

37:10.762 --> 37:11.995
And I like the laser cut.

37:12.064 --> 37:12.963
SUSANA: The laser cut's
really good.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.164
ANNA: And that is very pretty.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.298
LEMONIS: I like
what you did down here.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.900
Remember how uneven it was
at the bottom?

37:16.969 --> 37:19.336
SUSANA: Yes. Yeah.
I mean, it fits really good.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.705
LEMONIS: Just a couple
more details to iron out,

37:21.773 --> 37:22.906
and we should be good to go.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.975
Nice.
Really nice.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.843
I think the collection
looks great.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.520
Today we're gonna be
having the fashion show.

37:37.589 --> 37:42.626
I invited bloggers and editors
and buyers to create a buzz.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.397
Fashion show is
a different form of marketing

37:47.466 --> 37:49.032
that not only puts

37:49.101 --> 37:52.269
Susana Monaco's new line
on display,

37:52.337 --> 37:54.838
but hopefully it puts Susana
on display, as well.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.674
SUSANA: Just memorize
where you are space wise.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.743
Oh.
Hi, Marcus.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.411
LEMONIS: Hi. Do your thing.
I'm not even here.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.912
SUSANA: Can we try
it one more time?

38:02.981 --> 38:05.849
When you guys start, everybody,
your starting point

38:05.917 --> 38:08.585
is when the girl in front of you
hits that corner.

38:08.654 --> 38:09.686
Let's try it again.

38:09.755 --> 38:10.820
LEMONIS: Obviously I want
the clothes

38:10.889 --> 38:12.822
to get a huge reception.

38:12.891 --> 38:15.125
And I spent a lot of money
putting on this show.

38:15.193 --> 38:16.660
But what's more
important to me

38:16.728 --> 38:19.029
is that I want to see Susana
getting out in front of people,

38:19.097 --> 38:21.398
being proud of her work
and who she is.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.767
SUSANA: Everybody has to stand.
This is standing.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.669
This is power position.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.771
Shoulders back.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.173
You own this.

38:30.242 --> 38:33.410
LEMONIS: This is a perfect night
for you to get a fresh start.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.045
Tonight's about Susana.
ANNA: Yes, absolutely.

38:35.113 --> 38:37.080
LEMONIS: And I want you
to really support her.

38:37.149 --> 38:39.249
Truce?
ANNA: That's a hard mission.

38:39.318 --> 38:41.718
I was there front and center
holding her hand for years.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.087
LEMONIS: But, Anna,
don't let your attitude get

38:44.156 --> 38:45.322
in the way of your talent.

38:45.390 --> 38:46.323
ANNA: No, no, no.
LEMONIS: Do we have a deal?

38:46.391 --> 38:47.724
ANNA: Yes.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.459
LEMONIS: Let's get back in there
and support her, okay?

38:51.863 --> 38:54.197
SUSANA: All right, ladies,
let me take a look, please.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.536
You all look
incredibly beautiful.

38:59.604 --> 39:02.105
MARIO: If anybody need help,
I can do this.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.243
LEMONIS:
Ladies look amazing.

39:07.312 --> 39:08.745
This is a big night.
SUSANA: Yeah.

39:08.814 --> 39:10.180
LEMONIS: This is like
the rebirth.

39:10.248 --> 39:11.848
SUSANA: It's crazy.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.450
LEMONIS:
What's crazy about it?

39:13.518 --> 39:15.719
SUSANA: Just unbelievable,
actually.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.487
LEMONIS: Are you nervous?
SUSANA: Yes.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.924
LEMONIS: Do you see
how many people are up there?

39:20.992 --> 39:24.427
SUSANA: No.
LEMONIS: It's packed.

39:24.496 --> 39:26.796
"Allure's" there.
"Vanity Fair's" there.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.101
SUSANA: Okay.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.076
LEMONIS: It's packed.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.645
"Allure's" there.
"Vanity Fair's" there.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.248
There's, um...
SUSANA: Okay.

39:45.317 --> 39:47.384
Maybe I shouldn't know that.

39:47.452 --> 39:49.619
LEMONIS: This is where you were
always meant to be.

39:49.688 --> 39:50.687
SUSANA: Yay.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.522
Very exciting.
Let's have a show.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.758
Come on!
Whoo!

39:56.862 --> 39:58.361
LEMONIS: Folks,
it's a big night.

39:58.430 --> 39:59.829
I have the pleasure of being

39:59.898 --> 40:02.866
a new partner in a business
called Susana Monaco.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.300
Tonight, we're gonna be

40:04.369 --> 40:06.803
showing you
a brand-new collection

40:06.872 --> 40:08.938
that Susana has
designed herself,

40:09.007 --> 40:13.543
and it is the Spring/Summer
collection for 2017.

40:16.314 --> 40:18.281
The new Spring line
is manufactured

40:18.350 --> 40:20.350
with high quality supplex,

40:20.419 --> 40:23.653
giving it a cohesive,
unified look.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.655
If it sells as well
as I think it will,

40:25.724 --> 40:29.225
then I'll consider putting it
in the core collection.

40:29.294 --> 40:31.161
But it all starts with the buzz
we get created today.

40:31.229 --> 40:32.896
Don't shake.
It's okay.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.931
This is what you worked for.
SUSANA: Yeah.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.534
LEMONIS: And you know what?
All of this is your talent.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.502
I invested in what's
inside of you.

40:39.571 --> 40:40.970
Okay?

40:44.376 --> 40:48.378
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

40:50.315 --> 40:51.781
SUSANA:
I'd like to thank Marcus

40:51.850 --> 40:54.083
for giving me this opportunity

40:54.152 --> 40:57.187
to revive this company.

40:57.255 --> 40:58.822
And I really appreciate it.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.690
Thank you so much.

41:00.759 --> 41:04.861
Thank you.
And this is my dad.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.429
LEMONIS: I was really
touched by the fact

41:06.498 --> 41:08.698
that Mario came out
to support Susana.

41:08.767 --> 41:11.167
He's really been encouraging
through this whole process.

41:11.236 --> 41:13.303
It also seems like
the family dynamic

41:13.371 --> 41:15.905
at the factory has really,
really improved.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.207
You feel like your relationship

41:17.275 --> 41:18.608
with your brothers
is getting a little better?

41:18.677 --> 41:20.510
SUSANA: They were happy.
I think it's great

41:20.579 --> 41:21.945
that we went through
that whole process,

41:22.013 --> 41:23.213
and I think
they're getting past it.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.048
LEMONIS: And with
the manufacturing process

41:25.116 --> 41:26.749
for this line
going off without a hitch,

41:26.818 --> 41:29.118
well, it shows me that
real progress is being made.

41:30.922 --> 41:34.290
SUSANA:
She's a confident, chic,

41:34.359 --> 41:35.859
a strong woman who feels
good about herself.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.027
LEMONIS: So you'll be able
to buy it at Bloomingdale's,

41:38.096 --> 41:39.562
Nordstrom, Saks,

41:39.631 --> 41:42.632
Rue La La,
Susanamonaco.com, Shopbop.

41:42.701 --> 41:44.567
Throughout
my journey with Susana,

41:44.636 --> 41:46.803
I had one real goal in mind,

41:46.872 --> 41:48.872
and that was seeing
Susana comfortable

41:48.940 --> 41:51.207
with putting herself
at the forefront.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.076
People like to buy
from people.

41:53.144 --> 41:55.178
Now that she's not
hiding anymore,

41:55.247 --> 41:58.481
her sales are starting to follow
that same path of growth.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.149
I think the sky's the limit.

42:00.218 --> 42:01.251
ANNA: Congrats.

42:01.319 --> 42:02.485
SUSANA: Thank you so much.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.356
ANNA: You know
we do love each other.

42:06.424 --> 42:07.490
SUSANA: Yes.

42:07.559 --> 42:08.691
ANNA: And we are
really good friends.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.392
SUSANA: Yes.
We have to move forward now.

42:09.461 --> 42:11.928
ANNA: Yeah.

42:11.997 --> 42:13.162
LEMONIS:
I'm very proud of you.

42:13.231 --> 42:14.531
SUSANA: Thank you
so much, Marcus.

42:14.599 --> 42:16.099
LEMONIS: You know,
one thing that I think

42:16.167 --> 42:18.601
is important for you to remember

42:18.670 --> 42:20.436
is that you can't lose
your backbone anymore.

42:20.505 --> 42:22.572
SUSANA: No.
I think this whole experience

42:22.641 --> 42:26.409
has been an incredible
turning point, a change.

42:26.478 --> 42:29.779
It's not gonna go back.
LEMONIS: Good luck.

42:29.848 --> 42:31.514
SUSANA: Thank you, Marcus.
LEMONIS: I'll see you tomorrow.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.516
SUSANA: Okay.
