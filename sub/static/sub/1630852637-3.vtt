WEBVTT

01:46.815 --> 01:51.778
Babe. Babe? I think we're going.
We're going. What is that?

01:54.323 --> 01:59.536
Anyway, I mean, yeah,
it was really painful. And I was so young.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.749
You know what I mean?

02:06.043 --> 02:09.213
But the one thing that my mother did right

02:09.295 --> 02:11.632
was not let me hold my baby
in the hospital.

02:11.715 --> 02:15.135
That way I didn't have
any unhealthy attachments to her.

02:17.888 --> 02:21.099
But Leanne, she's right here.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.435
And watching another woman raise her baby.

02:23.519 --> 02:26.104
I-- Blows my mind.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.109
I know.
But even if it is hers…

02:31.193 --> 02:34.696
…she seems happy enough to let
Dorothy and Sean play house with him.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.575
She's not the most stable ship
in the sea, babe.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.040
You can see the leaks springing.

02:48.001 --> 02:54.091
Well, what happens if Leanne just decides
to leave one day and takes her kid?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.425
Then what?

02:55.509 --> 02:58.303
Dorothy is going to look
for her son forever?

02:59.638 --> 03:01.431
Seems like a shitty life.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.517
You have a point.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.562
Gotta have a legal leg to stand on.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.400
Unless we proved it was Leanne's.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.998
Little old for the pole, sis.

03:26.081 --> 03:27.207
Leave me alone.

03:28.208 --> 03:33.130
I have been tasked with covering
a Marilyn Monroe look-alike contest.

03:33.630 --> 03:37.009
And I'll have you know I'm definitely
not too old to strip.

03:37.092 --> 03:40.971
Would you make sure Leanne
doesn't let Jericho nap too long today?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.849
He wouldn't settle last night.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.768
I'm exhausted, and I'm fairly certain

03:46.852 --> 03:50.272
Marilyn's curves didn't include
heavy bags under her eyes.

03:52.191 --> 03:53.192
Okay.

03:55.027 --> 03:58.739
Tell Sean one of the mothers is
coming by today or tomorrow sometime

03:58.822 --> 04:01.408
to pick up the diaper bag she left behind.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.118
I'll be sure not to.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.419
This would be infinitely improved
with a fifth of vodka.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.087
So would you.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.464
Amen.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.216
You taking the kid to Aruba?

04:17.298 --> 04:19.009
No, I'm taking Leanne to the park.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.928
You want to come?
It's a gorgeous fucking day.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.846
No.
I couldn't even get her down the block.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.848
You think she's gonna stroll in the park?

04:24.932 --> 04:27.768
I think she's ready.
We're all making progress.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.521
Pretty soon
we'll be a normal fucking family.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.605
Yeah.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.106
About that…

04:34.942 --> 04:38.278
I was thinking we should test
Leanne and Jericho's DNA.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.197
Why the hell would we do that?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.074
To know for sure.

04:42.741 --> 04:46.203
And maybe initiate
some adoption proceedings.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.746
Make this whole debacle legal.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.124
Julian, things are good.
Try not to fuck with it.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.962
-You concentrate on you. At your place.
-I'm just trying to protect this--

04:55.045 --> 04:56.213
Protect what?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.883
Sean from himself.
He was talking about a beet latte.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.052
I won't be party to that kind of horror.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.012
I can't find his hat. I'll be right back.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.942
Julian, could you take him
for a second while I do this?

05:17.526 --> 05:21.029
I'm covered in kale.
He might be allergic.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.241
Ready?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.261
I found his sunglasses.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.679
Look how tiny they are.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.980
We don't have to go far.

06:15.626 --> 06:19.755
Oh, the flowers. Look.

06:19.838 --> 06:24.009
Look, flowers. Trees.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.749
Did you know you could eat those?

06:55.832 --> 06:57.918
-You can eat flowers?
-Well, some.

06:58.794 --> 07:01.505
These are dandelions.
The whole thing's edible.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.508
That's mustard flower. There's a purslane.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.388
These make a great chimichurri.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.431
Full of vitamins and omega-3s.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.269
You can put it in a soup
or a garnish or stew.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.525
It's nice.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.428
-Spare change?
-Sure, let me see what I got.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.180
Oh, yeah.

07:57.519 --> 07:58.604
I want to go home.

08:30.719 --> 08:31.929
Careful. It's hot.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.184
Put your tongue
back in your mouth, Sean.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.479
Not in the mood.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.525
I just found out that
while I'm playing dead diva,

08:44.608 --> 08:47.319
Isabelle is covering the Kaplowitz case.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.530
I think yours sounds more fun, Dorothy.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.114
That's very sweet of you, Leanne.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.159
But trust me,
there's nothing like a good murder trial.

08:54.243 --> 08:57.037
And do you know why I got stuck
with Marilyn?

08:57.120 --> 09:00.290
They said I was curvier.
Can you believe that?

09:04.002 --> 09:05.712
You do fill out that dress, Dorothy.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.842
Hey! Stop. You're going
to embarrass Leanne.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.344
This tastes like spring.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.388
Soup again, Sean?

09:14.471 --> 09:16.056
I was inspired by our walk.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.267
It's dandelion soup. It's good.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.853
I'm actually not very hungry.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.523
I think this dress has rearranged
my organs.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.316
I'm going to go cut myself out of it.

09:27.651 --> 09:28.986
I'll take him for his bath.

09:29.069 --> 09:33.615
No. I can tell he needs his mommy.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.300
What's up with you?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.970
Things just aren't right.
I'm not sleeping well.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.181
My wife and I keep getting
in stupid-ass fights.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.975
You're just coming off
your weird cult high.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.478
You'll ride it out.
Trust me, you just find your new high.

10:04.396 --> 10:07.441
You haven't seen any of those cult freaks,
have you?

10:07.524 --> 10:08.775
They're not messing with you?

10:08.859 --> 10:10.861
No.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.529
Why are we out here anyway?

10:13.488 --> 10:17.242
If your sister or Sean see me,
they aren't going to like it.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.996
Well, first, our usual gym
smells like an old man

10:21.079 --> 10:23.081
with a incurable staph infection.

10:23.165 --> 10:24.625
Fuck.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.210
Oh, fuck.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.920
Shit.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.047
Oh, fuck.

10:34.718 --> 10:38.972
And second, I need you to help me
get Jericho and Leanne's DNA.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.393
Couldn't be simpler. I already have
all the equipment you'll need.

10:44.478 --> 10:47.898
Yeah. You just shove this
up the baby's nose.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.361
No way. Just-- Just get one of those kits.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.863
You have to register,
use a credit card.

10:54.947 --> 10:58.325
It takes weeks. I need this now.
You'll be compensated more than fairly.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.452
Julian, I'm done playing pet detective.

11:02.704 --> 11:06.083
And don't shove this up anyone's nose.
That's not how it works.

11:06.166 --> 11:10.504
Just this one last thing,
for old times' sake.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.762
I'll make a call. For old times' sake.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.100
I got a dude who owes me a favor.
He works in a lab.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.352
But I'm only gonna consult.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.981
I'm not stepping foot in that house,
and you're still gonna pay.

11:30.941 --> 11:32.734
I don't know what I'd do without you.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.574
Homeless or hipster? Who's to tell?

11:45.873 --> 11:47.332
Who's that for?

11:47.416 --> 11:50.043
Kids in the park.
It looked like they were starving.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.503
You want to help me bring it out?

11:52.838 --> 11:55.424
No. I have to put Jericho down.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.017
Hey!

12:06.602 --> 12:07.728
I got some food.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.070
What is it?

12:17.154 --> 12:19.615
Hope you like it.
It's pizza al taglio.

12:19.698 --> 12:23.619
It's a basic Pinello tomato sauce,
and I top it off with a whipped lardo,

12:23.702 --> 12:28.457
and I finish it with a--
a grape and onion mostarda.

12:41.178 --> 12:43.972
It's weird, but it's kind of good.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.893
All right, so-- Well, look--
No, I'll just.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.938
I'll leave you this.
You guys help yourself.

12:53.524 --> 12:54.608
Great.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.612
Yeah.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.284
Yeah. Hair from Leanne and Jericho. Easy.

13:04.368 --> 13:06.578
Yeah, but it has to have follicles.

13:06.662 --> 13:08.580
And more is better
in case the sample is bad.

13:08.664 --> 13:11.083
Not as easy.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.086
Well, then you'll love this.
I need it in the next 30.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.005
He's got a window
to process it this evening.

13:17.089 --> 13:19.132
-Results tomorrow.
-Okay, head over now,

13:19.216 --> 13:21.552
I'll have it ready. Wait, where are you?

13:21.635 --> 13:23.595
I'm in a hospital, seeing a relative.

13:23.679 --> 13:25.347
And bring the cash.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.224
This kind of turnover isn't cheap, Julian.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.893
I know. Nothing is.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.502
Juju?

13:55.586 --> 13:57.087
Dad?

13:59.631 --> 14:00.632
Help.

14:02.384 --> 14:03.760
Please help us.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.269
Sorry, kid.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.396
This might sting.

15:10.702 --> 15:15.415
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.

15:15.499 --> 15:21.046
Oh, come to me. You're fine.
You're fine. It's okay.

15:29.638 --> 15:30.639
Fuck.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.580
-What are you doing?
-Fuck!

15:59.918 --> 16:00.919
Leanne.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.841
I was… just--

16:06.967 --> 16:10.971
A couple of weeks ago
when we were, you know…

16:11.722 --> 16:12.890
Having sex.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.767
Yes. That.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.103
I--

16:19.354 --> 16:20.522
I lost my watch.

16:22.316 --> 16:23.525
Looks like you found it.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.529
But being in here…

16:29.281 --> 16:32.659
made me realize I miss you.

16:33.869 --> 16:36.830
I miss being close to you. Touching you.

16:36.914 --> 16:37.956
You're lying.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.584
I think about you all the time.

17:03.732 --> 17:04.900
That hurt.

17:06.234 --> 17:09.195
Sorry. I-- I got carried away.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.616
Fuck!

17:18.079 --> 17:19.580
No, Julian.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.085
I don't know what you're doing,
but I want you to leave.

17:23.669 --> 17:24.670
Now.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.680
-Hey!
-You know that thing I was doing?

17:34.763 --> 17:36.557
I got the kid's hair
but nothing from Leanne.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.308
It's like she never sheds.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.853
Did you try her brush?
And her pillow?

17:41.603 --> 17:44.231
Great idea. Of course I tried that.

17:44.314 --> 17:48.110
So-- Okay, maybe get Dorothy's hair
instead?

17:48.193 --> 17:50.320
To-- To prove that she's not the mother.

17:50.404 --> 17:53.073
I thought the point was
to prove that it's Leanne's kid,

17:53.156 --> 17:55.409
and then convince her
to hand him over legally?

17:55.492 --> 17:56.785
I've been ruminating on this,

17:56.869 --> 17:59.454
and I don't think anything
is going to change.

17:59.538 --> 18:01.290
Not until Dorothy faces her truth.

18:01.373 --> 18:04.459
After that, steps can be taken
for her to keep the baby.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.800
Hey.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.429
Try the couch cushions.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.973
Dorothy's hairs.

18:22.019 --> 18:24.646
Oh, fuck. Roscoe's here.

18:24.730 --> 18:25.814
Dorothy's hairs.

18:28.901 --> 18:30.402
Oh, fuck! There's nothing.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.325
Bingo.

18:36.408 --> 18:37.492
I found her brush.

18:38.202 --> 18:39.453
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.509
This was harder than you think.

18:54.343 --> 18:55.344
Okay.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.536
I thought you were keeping it simple?

19:20.619 --> 19:22.871
What, are you feeding those squatters
again, Sean?

19:22.955 --> 19:26.083
I mean, is that a good idea?
They're like stray cats.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.502
-They'll never leave.
-They're hungry kids, Dorothy.

19:30.462 --> 19:33.215
I'm sorry. I know this means a lot to you.

19:34.132 --> 19:38.387
I'm just cranky. They've got me
covering a pet parade in Eastwick.

19:39.096 --> 19:40.848
My leopard print.

19:51.275 --> 19:54.111
-Hey.
-Hey, man. Can I use your shitter?

19:55.195 --> 19:56.488
Sure. Follow me.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.585
-There you go.
-Thanks, man.

20:09.668 --> 20:10.669
Sure.

20:33.442 --> 20:37.529
Sean! What if they're casing the place?

20:37.613 --> 20:39.656
One break-in isn't enough for you?

20:39.740 --> 20:44.536
Dorothy. They're not hardened criminals.
It was a kid who needed to shit.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.581
We must consider our own child, Sean.

20:48.498 --> 20:49.917
I think we can do both.

20:51.793 --> 20:55.005
Listen, I understand
you feel for these kids…

21:01.803 --> 21:04.389
-Hello?
-Hi, Carlos. Cancel the pet parade.

21:04.473 --> 21:06.183
-What do you mean?
-I have our story!

21:06.266 --> 21:08.393
-What? Where?
-Bring the crew to my house.

21:08.477 --> 21:10.687
-Leo too?
-Oh, yeah, Leo too. Of course.

21:13.023 --> 21:15.984
Hi. I'm Dorothy Turner from 8 News.

21:16.068 --> 21:18.445
And I'd really like to talk to you
about your plight.

21:22.533 --> 21:25.494
I'd really like to discuss
your terrible situation.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.917
I'm not trying to scare you.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.337
I just really want other people
to become aware of your plight.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.890
It's no wonder these kids
are distrustful of adults.

21:46.974 --> 21:52.396
We are the architects of the broken system
that has left them on the streets.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.234
Hi. Hi, what's your name?

22:03.156 --> 22:04.950
Let's talk to this young man over here.

22:05.033 --> 22:07.619
Excuse me. Hi.

22:07.703 --> 22:09.162
Do you mind if we speak to you?

22:11.039 --> 22:13.083
Can you tell us how long
have you been on the streets?

22:15.085 --> 22:16.837
Since I aged out of foster care.

22:18.547 --> 22:20.048
That is terrible.

22:20.132 --> 22:23.427
And tell us some of the obstacles
you've faced.

22:25.387 --> 22:28.974
Yeah, a bunch. I haven't really
been able to find any help.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.893
At least at first.

22:31.435 --> 22:33.562
Not even for my heart problem that--

22:33.645 --> 22:35.606
Damn it! I lost picture.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.775
Can we--

22:40.694 --> 22:41.737
All right.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.238
We need a different story.

22:43.322 --> 22:45.115
No.

22:45.199 --> 22:46.200
Sean?

22:46.783 --> 22:48.702
-I'm crafty for the day.
-Hey, man!

22:48.785 --> 22:51.496
Hey, what's going on?
I got you a sandwich.

22:52.247 --> 22:53.874
It's simple. Chicken and cheese.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.626
It's not that simple because it's,
you know,

22:55.709 --> 22:57.961
artisanal cheese from Amish country.

22:58.045 --> 23:00.881
You know, it's on a cracked sourdough…

23:00.964 --> 23:02.674
Get some of that. This is great!

23:02.758 --> 23:04.968
Sandwich? Sandwich?

23:05.052 --> 23:07.346
Why don't you ask him some questions
about what he's doing,

23:07.429 --> 23:08.555
why he's doing it?

23:08.639 --> 23:10.807
We'll make this a whole family affair.

23:11.892 --> 23:13.185
Go. Everybody. Go.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.980
Yeah, you could see.
Well, there's your sandwich.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.191
Sandwich?

23:21.318 --> 23:24.029
Dig in. Dig in, dig in.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.782
The plight of these kids is dire.

23:26.865 --> 23:29.284
Why do I keep saying that word?

23:29.368 --> 23:32.371
But a neighborhood angel
has stepped in with a helping hand,

23:32.454 --> 23:36.625
creating healthy and delicious meals
to feed these homeless youth.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.836
Okay, take it. Sandwich?

23:38.919 --> 23:40.796
All right. Chicken and cheese.

23:41.421 --> 23:44.049
-Thanks for helping. They loved those.
-Sure.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.801
I've been on the streets.

23:45.884 --> 23:48.637
I know what it's like to be hungry.
And I'm just trying to give back.

23:49.263 --> 23:51.849
Look at that. That's your daddy!

23:51.932 --> 23:53.517
He's going to be a big star.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.936
I don't know about that.

23:56.019 --> 23:59.356
It'll happen. You'll see.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.400
Here. Let me take him, Leanne.

24:02.401 --> 24:05.654
I just wish more people would help,
because I only have two hands.

24:08.156 --> 24:11.159
Sean, you're doing so great.
The camera loves you.

24:11.243 --> 24:13.036
Thanks, Leanne.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.496
You should have come out.

24:14.580 --> 24:16.206
No, I wouldn't want to steal
your spotlight.

24:16.290 --> 24:19.001
Do you feel that what
you're doing here will motivate others?

24:20.043 --> 24:21.128
I hope so.

24:21.211 --> 24:25.507
It's heartbreaking to see people anywhere
but, especially in our community.

24:29.052 --> 24:31.763
Here. This should be my wrap-up.
I was pretty pleased with it.

24:31.847 --> 24:35.350
It's nice and healthy,
grass-fed, pasture-raised…

24:35.434 --> 24:38.437
You got to love it. That's a real hero.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.857
-Now here's Courtney with the weather.
-I guess they ran out of time.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.734
…that Philadelphia will continue…

24:43.817 --> 24:46.528
That was fantastic, darling.
I'm so proud of you.

24:48.488 --> 24:50.699
-Yeah, so proud.
-Hi.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.168
Oh, no.

25:01.251 --> 25:04.296
No, no, no, no, you're not going to
slip on my watch.

25:06.340 --> 25:07.466
Besides, I need it.

25:09.426 --> 25:10.844
Juju, what's wrong?

25:11.803 --> 25:14.348
And don't try lying to me.
I can always tell.

25:23.732 --> 25:25.442
I don't want to lose you too, Dottie.

25:28.529 --> 25:30.030
I'm not going anywhere.

25:33.116 --> 25:34.243
Is this about Mom?

25:37.579 --> 25:41.708
I-- I want you to keep… the baby.

25:42.751 --> 25:46.421
Of course, I'm keeping Jericho.

25:47.005 --> 25:48.799
What are you worried about?

25:59.768 --> 26:00.853
What is that?

26:01.645 --> 26:03.730
I had Jericho's DNA tested.

26:04.648 --> 26:05.774
What?

26:07.025 --> 26:08.402
-Why?
-And yours.

26:09.653 --> 26:11.697
Julian, what is going on?

26:15.284 --> 26:17.160
Jericho isn't your baby.

26:20.455 --> 26:23.083
Of course Jericho is my baby.

26:24.001 --> 26:26.253
What is going on with you?

26:30.883 --> 26:33.302
Oh, God, are you using again?

26:33.969 --> 26:37.806
Juju, we'll get you proper help
this time. Someplace nice.

26:37.890 --> 26:40.726
-We are all here to support you.
-You don't understand.

26:41.977 --> 26:44.479
I saw Jericho.

26:45.522 --> 26:46.773
I saw him--

26:47.316 --> 26:49.193
I saw him when I died.

26:49.818 --> 26:51.445
He was there with me.

26:52.404 --> 26:53.739
He's gone, Dottie.

26:55.574 --> 26:58.619
I tested your hair and his.

27:00.495 --> 27:01.997
Jericho is not your baby.

27:02.748 --> 27:03.874
This proves it.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.257
Okay, I believe you.

27:13.258 --> 27:16.428
I believe you saw something.

27:17.888 --> 27:20.265
That was a terrible night.

27:20.349 --> 27:23.060
-Dottie.
-And you aren't fully recovered yet.

27:24.561 --> 27:26.146
You need more time.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.233
I see that now.

27:29.316 --> 27:30.442
Dottie.

27:33.570 --> 27:34.863
I'll get the door.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.119
Hi.

27:41.203 --> 27:43.872
-Hey, can I pick up my bag?
-Of course, of course.

27:43.956 --> 27:45.290
Yes. Come in.

27:45.374 --> 27:50.379
Leanne! Do we know where
Brooke's diaper bag is?

27:56.218 --> 27:57.928
Hope it's all there.

27:59.805 --> 28:01.598
That was so chaotic.

28:01.682 --> 28:03.225
You didn't get stung, did you?

28:03.308 --> 28:05.310
I'm fine. No biggie.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.814
That's my brush.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.198
Must have fallen out.

28:18.907 --> 28:21.368
Okay, great. All here.

28:22.119 --> 28:23.954
-Thanks again.
-Yeah, yeah.

28:32.546 --> 28:34.381
Do you need anything else, Dorothy?

28:35.007 --> 28:38.218
No, thank you, Leanne,
I'm just going to speak with my brother.

28:42.431 --> 28:43.765
That was her brush.

28:45.225 --> 28:46.351
I see.

28:48.604 --> 28:52.024
You took her hair, not mine.

28:52.107 --> 28:54.067
That's why your report was wrong.

28:59.114 --> 29:00.115
Julian.

29:02.117 --> 29:04.161
Never do anything like that again.

29:04.995 --> 29:06.580
It was a serious breach of trust.

29:06.663 --> 29:09.082
Yeah, I won't.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.502
I promise.
