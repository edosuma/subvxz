17:53.375 --> 17:54.874
so he can use them to build a tank

17:54.876 --> 17:56.409
to attack Arkham Asylum.

17:56.411 --> 17:57.877
Why, unprompted, did you

17:57.879 --> 18:00.580
just tell us your entire evil plan?

18:00.582 --> 18:03.583
I don't know. It's just a thing we do.

18:03.585 --> 18:06.219
Hey, for the record, I do like you.

18:06.221 --> 18:09.088
I'm just really focused
on my career right now.

18:09.090 --> 18:11.391
- Ugh.
- Ooh, that is one of the things

18:11.393 --> 18:13.626
that you said you looked for in a man.

18:13.628 --> 18:15.662
Just so you know, we're through, Dan!

18:15.664 --> 18:18.765
- Mm, I think he knows.
- [Sighs]

18:18.767 --> 18:21.434
- [Batarang beeping]
- You have a good night now.

18:21.436 --> 18:23.336
The joke's on him.

18:23.338 --> 18:25.939
I only had $2,000 in my wallet.

18:25.941 --> 18:27.974
I can't believe we
thought this would work.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.742
All right, let's face it.
We're not gonna meet Batman.

18:29.744 --> 18:31.277
[Grunts]

18:31.279 --> 18:32.812
You know what? I bet
this stupid Batarang

18:32.814 --> 18:33.913
isn't even real.

18:33.915 --> 18:36.482
[Distant screaming]

18:36.484 --> 18:38.284
[Whooshing]

18:38.286 --> 18:39.452
- Teddy?
- What?

18:39.454 --> 18:41.154
Where's the Batarang?

18:41.156 --> 18:43.289
- It's right here.
- [Gasps]

18:43.291 --> 18:45.992
[Laughter]

18:45.994 --> 18:49.295
Batman, you only owe me 28,000 now!

18:49.297 --> 18:50.997
- We met Batman.
- We met Batman?

18:50.999 --> 18:52.131
- Met Batman! Yeah!
- We met Batman.

18:52.133 --> 18:53.700
All: We met Batman!

18:53.702 --> 18:57.303
We met Batman! We met Batman!

18:57.305 --> 18:59.372
I don't know how this keeps happening.

18:59.374 --> 19:01.174
- This?
- Well, not <i>this,</i>

19:01.176 --> 19:02.875
but meeting guys who seem great

19:02.877 --> 19:05.511
and then turn out to be
lying pieces of garbage.

19:05.513 --> 19:07.480
I thought my system was perfect.

19:07.482 --> 19:08.881
I make a list of all the qualities

19:08.883 --> 19:10.183
I'm looking for in a guy,

19:10.185 --> 19:11.851
assign each one a point value,

19:11.853 --> 19:13.519
and if that number exceeds 200...

19:13.521 --> 19:15.822
Can I make a suggestion? Burn that list.

19:15.824 --> 19:17.624
It's in the Cloud, so
I can't really do that.

19:17.626 --> 19:20.026
You're 25. You can't
hold yourself to a list,

19:20.028 --> 19:21.661
because you don't even
know what you want.

19:21.663 --> 19:23.563
And even when you do, you're still gonna

19:23.565 --> 19:25.465
date a bunch of terrible guys

19:25.467 --> 19:27.300
and have horrible things happen.

19:27.302 --> 19:29.736
- Until I meet the right one?
- Sure.

19:29.738 --> 19:32.305
Or just one who's a really good liar.

19:32.307 --> 19:34.374
That's what I'm aiming for.

19:34.376 --> 19:37.143
Look. Just because you
can't avoid all the dirtbags,

19:37.145 --> 19:39.712
that doesn't mean you
don't deserve better.

19:39.714 --> 19:43.416
Aww. Thanks, Jackie.

19:43.418 --> 19:45.218
What are you doing?

19:45.220 --> 19:47.020
I'm trying to backwards-hug you.

19:47.022 --> 19:48.888
If I don't want your front hugs,

19:48.890 --> 19:50.923
what makes you think
I want your back ones?

19:50.925 --> 19:52.158
Okay. Sorry.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.660
Okay. We're done here.

19:53.662 --> 19:55.261
So you're going to let us go?

19:55.263 --> 19:57.563
Well, I asked the boss what
he wanted us to do with you,

19:57.565 --> 19:59.565
but he answered in the form of a riddle.

19:59.567 --> 20:00.667
Couldn't quite figure it out.

20:00.669 --> 20:01.906
Hmm. What a shock.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.237
What has no legs,
but never stops running?

20:04.239 --> 20:06.272
A nose?

20:06.274 --> 20:07.440
A refrigerator?

20:07.442 --> 20:09.042
A river.

20:09.044 --> 20:12.078
Oh! He wants us to
throw them in the river.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.446
Smooth.

20:13.448 --> 20:15.181
I told you she was smart.

20:15.183 --> 20:16.783
Would you like to
tell us your SAT scores?

20:16.785 --> 20:18.251
Okay, shh.

20:18.253 --> 20:20.219
I guess I should get that bracelet back.

20:20.221 --> 20:22.088
- [Scoffs]
- [Elevator bell dings]

20:24.159 --> 20:26.526
It's Robin. Batman must be here!

20:26.528 --> 20:28.928
- [Henchmen clamoring]
- Go! Go!

20:28.930 --> 20:30.263
That was weird.

20:30.265 --> 20:32.965
Jackie, get a pair of scissors,

20:32.967 --> 20:34.367
cut me out of this suit.

20:34.369 --> 20:36.135
Emily, why are you still at work?

20:36.137 --> 20:38.004
Get a boyfriend or something.

20:39.741 --> 20:41.607
- Even just a hobby.
- [Sighs]

20:43.162 --> 20:44.911
All right, this is, like, a freaky alley,

20:44.913 --> 20:46.646
and it is pitch black.

20:46.648 --> 20:48.414
We didn't want to be there,
but we had to be there.

20:48.416 --> 20:50.583
- Then these guys... I mean...
- It was you. It was you.

20:50.585 --> 20:52.618
- It was all of us.
- It was an effort together.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.220
Hey.

20:54.222 --> 20:55.588
What are you doing?

20:55.590 --> 20:57.156
Pretending to listen to their story

20:57.158 --> 21:00.093
and returning this pizza
stone for store credit.

21:00.095 --> 21:02.228
- Atta girl.
- All right, so this bad guy's

21:02.230 --> 21:03.830
got Batman dead to rights.

21:03.832 --> 21:06.466
And we're like, "Get
your hands off our friend!"

21:06.468 --> 21:08.167
"Get 'em off!" And then with that,

21:08.169 --> 21:09.669
he sees us,

21:09.671 --> 21:12.071
and then he turns around and he runs.

21:12.073 --> 21:13.473
- See ya!
- [Laughing]

21:13.475 --> 21:15.308
- Yeah.
- Huh.

21:15.310 --> 21:18.277
That obviously never happened.

21:18.279 --> 21:20.413
- Obviously.
- Obviously.

21:20.415 --> 21:23.449
Let... come on...

21:23.451 --> 21:25.151
Obviously.

21:26.488 --> 21:28.087
Obviously.
