you came, Elle.
I wasn’t sure you would.

16:26.069 --> 16:30.153
I have been thinking
about you and wondering
how you've been since...

16:30.240 --> 16:31.525
Better.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.736
Great, actually.

16:35.245 --> 16:38.282
Thanks to you.
I just decided to
Clean up this place,

16:38.373 --> 16:42.332

with bad thoughts.

That's just...

Nice, single guys like you?

16:54.431 --> 16:55.420
(CHUCKLES)

16:56.933 --> 16:59.800
Maybe I should
take this list.
No, no.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.102
I'm sorry, Elle.

You were born for this.

that's the easy part.

train me, Mer.

are there like you?

I don't know.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.767
To be honest,
I don't want to know.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.275
I have a kind of problem.

I guess you could say
I'm like an addict.

overwhelming hunger to...

of others.

But somehow,
since the other day,
since meeting you,

20:19.135 --> 20:21.968
I feel like maybe
I don't have
to be so special.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.384
Maybe I can
just be Gabriel again.

into high gear.

he's going
to kill again.

look into someone else

is a killer. We know that.

will we witness the act,
or will he do it in
a dark alley somewhere?

you're wrong?

rethink this.

is bound to look suspicious,

Angela's gonna react?

I thought you two should meet.
Trevor has an ability, too.

31:48.991 --> 31:51.357
An ability?
I don't understand.

31:51.452 --> 31:55.536
Don't be mad,
but I got Trevor's number
off that list you had.

31:55.623 --> 31:59.036
I really think it's important
for you to get to know people
like yourself.

31:59.126 --> 32:02.038
I mean, alcoholics
can't do it alone.

32:05.382 --> 32:08.545
Trevor, why don't you
Show us what you can do?

32:09.804 --> 32:11.010
Okay.

32:21.732 --> 32:22.721
(GASPS)

32:26.070 --> 32:27.059
(GASPS)

32:27.988 --> 32:31.151
(CHUCKLING) Wow.
That is so cool.

32:32.201 --> 32:35.910
Gabriel,
isn't that special?

32:39.375 --> 32:40.990
Wait here.
I have a great idea.

32:48.342 --> 32:50.549
Soup is delicious.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.298
Italian lentil.
Your mother's recipe.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.718
Something on your mind?

32:57.810 --> 33:00.677
What's the matter, Arthur?
You can't see inside it?

33:02.022 --> 33:05.264
You just seem far away.

33:05.359 --> 33:10.820
I just wonder sometimes
if without your power,
you'd know me at all anymore.

33:22.251 --> 33:23.741
(GROANING)

33:24.837 --> 33:26.293
Indigestion?

33:28.757 --> 33:31.999
So, what do you think, Arthur?
Do you still know me?

33:34.471 --> 33:38.305
Can you tell anything
about me just by
looking in my eyes?

33:38.392 --> 33:43.102
You're my wife, Angela.
I know you like
I know my own heart.

33:44.398 --> 33:45.638
Really?

33:46.859 --> 33:49.225
So, what am I
gonna do now?

33:49.320 --> 33:52.904
Am I gonna kiss you,
or am I gonna kill you?

33:55.618 --> 33:56.607
(GASPS)

33:56.702 --> 33:59.284
I love that.
Don't you love that?

33:59.371 --> 34:00.451
That's great.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.872
It's so special.
Let's see it again.

34:03.959 --> 34:07.247
You think he's so special?
I bet he can't do this.

34:07.338 --> 34:08.623
(SCREAMS)

34:10.257 --> 34:11.588
Gabriel!

34:19.475 --> 34:21.932
I think you need
to leave, now.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.390
Gabriel, don't!

34:25.481 --> 34:26.596
(GROANS)

34:26.690 --> 34:27.679
(GRUNTS)

34:30.945 --> 34:33.436
Please.
How did you...

34:34.823 --> 34:36.529
You don't have
to do this.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.401
Who are you?

34:42.081 --> 34:43.070
(GASPS)

34:50.506 --> 34:51.791
Get out.

(CAR HONKING)

35:13.654 --> 35:17.567
We can't do this.
Bennet, we have
to make him stop.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.489
This is incredible.

exposes the brain.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.500
Oh, my God.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.370
(PANTING)

35:50.983 --> 35:53.565
Our son, Arthur.
Our own son.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.813
There are larger issues
at stake, Angela.

35:55.904 --> 35:59.613
You can't let sentimentality
derail everything
that we worked so hard for.

35:59.700 --> 36:02.157
I'm sentimental
because I don't want
to murder our son?

36:02.244 --> 36:03.484
We were gonna
rebuild the world.

36:03.579 --> 36:05.911
You were a great man,
Arthur.

36:05.998 --> 36:09.832
You were a visionary,
but somewhere along the line,
you lost your soul.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.658
And I make no apology...

36:11.754 --> 36:13.164
(GROANING)

36:21.555 --> 36:22.920
I lied.

36:23.932 --> 36:25.888
It's not your
mother's recipe.

he's a casualty
of a field op.

NATHAN: Ma?

36:52.086 --> 36:53.121
(WHISPERS) Nathan.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.251
Anybody home?

36:58.300 --> 36:59.460
Ma?

37:07.518 --> 37:08.633
Dad!

37:11.438 --> 37:13.053
Oh, my God.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.685
I think he's had
a heart attack.
Is he...

37:16.777 --> 37:19.644
He's still breathing.
He's still alive.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.321
We're wrapped here.
Just one more loose end.

37:27.371 --> 37:30.738
No, no. Not that thing.
The other thing.
I'll let you know.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.249
Don't beat yourself up.

37:34.336 --> 37:37.749
We've done invaluable
work here. Those tapes will
be studied and analyzed...

37:37.840 --> 37:40.923
We created a monster.
We set him loose
on the world.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.215
I wouldn't worry
too much about that.

37:42.302 --> 37:46.261
I get the feeling that
we'll be tracking down
Mr. Gray again soon.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.009
That's not the point!

37:48.100 --> 37:50.933
He had a soul, Bennet.
He could've been saved.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.180
We're not missionaries.

37:53.313 --> 37:57.306
If they had wanted us to bring
him in, that would've been
the assignment. It wasn't.

38:01.280 --> 38:06.115
We follow orders,
Elle. We're agents.
That's what we do.

38:07.035 --> 38:09.947
Now excuse me.
My ride is here.

38:34.897 --> 38:37.889
Where to, my friend?
JFK, please.

38:42.571 --> 38:45.813
NATHAN:
We should call Peter.
Maybe we should wait.

38:46.992 --> 38:50.359
Until what?
Until we have
something to tell him.

39:00.047 --> 39:03.960
I'm sorry. He's gone.
He suffered
a massive coronary

39:04.092 --> 39:07.129
brought on by anterior
myocardial infarction.

39:07.262 --> 39:11.380
There was nothing
we could do.
Heart attack?

39:11.475 --> 39:14.262
I'd like a cremation
as soon as possible.

39:15.270 --> 39:18.012
Why don't you go home
and get some rest?

39:18.106 --> 39:20.438
We can deal
with the paperwork
in the morning.

39:25.489 --> 39:26.774
I can't believe it.

39:28.825 --> 39:30.281
He's dead.

39:41.421 --> 39:42.797
It's done.

39:48.470 --> 39:49.676
Yes.

39:50.973 --> 39:52.213
I understand.

39:54.643 --> 39:56.304
She wants a cremation.

39:57.813 --> 40:00.099
I can procure
another body,
of course.

40:01.024 --> 40:05.768
I'm afraid the poison
caused irreversible damage to
the peripheral nervous system.

40:05.862 --> 40:08.319
The paralysis
will likely
be permanent.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.281
I'm sorry.

40:28.218 --> 40:31.301
He's with Izzy now.
Izzy?

40:31.680 --> 40:33.511
Thank you.
Thank you.

40:33.640 --> 40:34.846
Izzy.

40:36.310 --> 40:39.222
He hated that dog.
Of course.

40:39.313 --> 40:41.679
It was the one
living thing he met
that ever disobeyed him.

when we would sit with Dad
out here when we were kids,

40:47.070 --> 40:51.655
watch Izzy bury her bones?
(SOBBING) Yeah.
I can't believe he's gone.

40:51.742 --> 40:52.822

Let's not
idolize your father
because he's dead.
