00:39.831 --> 00:41.083
He's out.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.252
What do you mean?

00:43.460 --> 00:45.045
Sylvester. He's escaped.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.338
Impossible.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.090
Maximum alert.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.306
Damn it!

00:57.224 --> 00:58.892
He's been spotted on the mezzanine.

00:59.101 --> 00:59.935
Secure perimeters.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.938
Alert topside. Initiate probers. Move!

01:03.355 --> 01:04.605
Move! Move!

01:07.192 --> 01:09.987
He's exiting the building. Move out.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.663
There he is. Nail him.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.793
He's heading for the maze.
We've got him.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.381
Cut him off!

01:29.590 --> 01:31.049
Toward the fountain.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.052
There he goes. He's headed back.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.805
Coming back, toward the fountain.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.933
He's approaching the fountain.
Seal him off.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.228
We've got him.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.981
Be careful. He's dangerous.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.570
There's nowhere to go, Sly.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.072
Give it up.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.284
Security.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.077
Go.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.038
The rest of you, come with me.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.223
Check the perimeters.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.583
Nice try, pal.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.050
Take him.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.063
Stop him!

03:35.215 --> 03:38.010
That'll be quite enough, Sylvester.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.636
There you are, doc.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.680
He nearly made it this time.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.350
Tomorrow you will explain how
a mere toddler manages to escape...

03:45.601 --> 03:50.063
from a laboratory
25 stories below ground.

03:50.314 --> 03:51.940
What kind of kids you breeding?

03:52.691 --> 03:54.568
Nearly blew us away with karate.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.612
Remarkable.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.658
Once again we demonstrate
the superiority of the Kinder method.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.287
Take him to the secret lab.

04:18.966 --> 04:21.094
Operation Twincomp, access requested.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.890
Analysing voiceprint.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.808
Review project in summary form.

04:27.059 --> 04:27.893
Twincomp...

04:28.101 --> 04:32.731
is designed to prove the superiority
of the Kinder method of child rearing.

04:34.149 --> 04:37.736
To accomplish this, two years ago,
twin brothers Sylvester and Whit...

04:38.028 --> 04:40.864
were born to a specially selected
surrogate mother.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.951
Director of operations,
Dr Elena Kinder, arranged...

04:44.159 --> 04:47.412
for Whit to be adopted
into the home of her niece...

04:47.621 --> 04:50.916
and her niece's husband,
Dr Dan Bobbins.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.461
Sly was placed in the Babyco
Hyper-Developmental Habitat...

04:54.711 --> 04:57.589
to be raised under the guidance
of the Kinder method.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.050
Summarize operational protocol.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.719
It is imperative for the integrity
of this experiment...

05:03.011 --> 05:06.348
that no one ever discover
that Sly and Whit are twins...

05:06.598 --> 05:08.559
especially the boys themselves.

05:08.809 --> 05:12.229
A comparative evaluation of the boys
will occur by age 6...

05:12.479 --> 05:16.233
to establish conclusively the
superiority of the Kinder method.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.277
Updating experiment log.

05:18.527 --> 05:22.197
Last night, Baby Sylvester made his way
up 25 stories, undetected...

05:22.489 --> 05:24.950
escaping from his habitat
in a secret lab.

05:25.409 --> 05:28.161
Even though it now appears
that Sly cannot be controlled...

05:28.412 --> 05:32.958
Dr Kinder will be pleased by this
display of skill and intelligence.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.003
I however, remain apprehensive.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.974
Under the guidance of its chairman,
Dr Elena Kinder...

05:49.224 --> 05:52.477
Baby Geniuses lnc.
And its parent company Babyco...

05:52.686 --> 05:56.607
are the world's largest manufacturer
of products for the baby.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.776
Babyco is also a vital
charitable organization...

05:59.985 --> 06:03.739
which sponsors orphanages
in 10 countries around the globe.

06:03.947 --> 06:08.452
The latest one dedicatedjust a week
ago, right here in Pasadena.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.247
Today we are deeper
in Dr Kinder's debt...

06:12.497 --> 06:15.417
for the extraordinary gift.

06:15.667 --> 06:20.130
Joyworld, the world's largest
indoor amusement park.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.637
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the founder and CEO of Babyco...

06:26.887 --> 06:29.640
my friend, Dr Elena Kinder.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.227
Thank you.

06:33.477 --> 06:34.394
Thank you.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.732
I'm gonna break out.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.444
You can't get hives just because
your aunt comes into the room.

06:42.653 --> 06:45.530
I can't help it. She starts lying.
I start breaking out.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.742
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all
for coming here today.

06:48.992 --> 06:52.496
We at Babyco believe that babies
have a language of their own.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.623
We're dedicated to proving it.

06:54.873 --> 06:59.336
Our research in infant potentiality
is the model of the field.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.713
But in the final analysis...

07:01.922 --> 07:05.842
the simple answer as to
why we do what we do is...

07:06.093 --> 07:07.719
we love babies.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.764
Loves babies.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.057
Loves money.

07:12.349 --> 07:16.019
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's have a party.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.189
Welcome to Joyworld.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.794
Look, it's a roller coaster!

07:47.217 --> 07:50.095
So the park, of course,
will be free for all children.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.431
But the money collected
from adults...

07:52.639 --> 07:56.018
will go to the Babyco
Worldwide Orphanage Foundation.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.812
Is this a terrific lady, or what?

08:00.397 --> 08:01.899
This is kind of great.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.276
She does a lot of good.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.653
She's good at stealing your ideas.

08:06.904 --> 08:07.738
Attention!

08:08.030 --> 08:09.823
Has anyone lost a baby?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.159
A very big baby?

08:12.784 --> 08:14.244
Ladies and gentlemen...

08:14.494 --> 08:15.746
Baby Bunting!

08:16.455 --> 08:18.457
That looks like your illustration.

08:18.749 --> 08:21.501
That looks like Boo Boo Boy
from Baby's Good Day.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.379
Bunting came into this world
just last week.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.591
Now, everything is fully controlled...

08:27.883 --> 08:30.344
by our computerized command centre.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.054
Hiya, fellas.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.099
And now go to crossover mode.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.519
Okay, Richard.
Give me Baby Bunting vocal.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.938
What's your name, little girl?

08:42.188 --> 08:43.690
Erin. My name is Erin.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.485
What a sweet name.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.321
Give Baby Bunting a big hug.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.907
And cue burp...

08:52.157 --> 08:52.991
now.

08:55.619 --> 08:58.247
Well! Think about changing his diaper.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.749
Come on, honey. This way.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.584
Kids, good news!

09:02.793 --> 09:05.003
Robotic Santa and the robotic elves...

09:05.295 --> 09:08.590
are waiting to greet you
at the robotic North Pole.

09:08.840 --> 09:12.427
In fact, we have robotic entertainers
located throughout the park...

09:12.678 --> 09:15.847
all controlled from our
central command centre.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.267
Okay, let's cue up for Robo-Zoo.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.687
And here we have the world's
most unique animal farm.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.438
We call it Robo-Zoo.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.024
Each child gets a remote control...

09:26.275 --> 09:28.652
to control their own robotic animal.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.446
Why wouldn't you have
real animals in your zoo?

09:31.697 --> 09:33.991
Good heavens! Anybody could do that.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.619
Plastic zoo.
That's definitely Aunt Elena's idea.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.913
At least she could have introduced you.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.916
She steals from your books,
from your research.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.084
I'm flattered.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.004
She knows about your breakthrough
in infant language.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.381
She'll probably try to steal that too.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.800
You make her sound
like Attila the Hun.

09:52.134 --> 09:57.264
Honey, we're barely able to afford your
research facility and the preschool.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.726
She does this all the time.
It's just not right.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.061
I think she's just goal-oriented.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.522
Her goal is to take
over the world. I know.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.983
I lived with her
for more than half my life.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.277
And look how great you turned out.

10:24.791 --> 10:25.959
Lenny?

10:31.215 --> 10:33.759
Where are you going
with those children?

10:34.009 --> 10:35.886
What children? These are not children.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.139
These are plumbers.
They're gonna help me fix the sink.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.182
Good-luck kiss.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.517
With this house, you
need more than luck.

10:42.768 --> 10:44.144
Okay, let's get to work.

10:44.353 --> 10:47.773
Just as you thought, our line
of expandable infant clothing...

10:48.023 --> 10:50.901
has elicited a tremendous
response in our first pass.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.446
Huge numbers from the Kmart
and Wal-Mart shoppers.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.741
That should increase our market share.
Put it in production.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.285
Tell me of the new ones.
How many possibles?

11:00.577 --> 11:02.788
- Eight show potential.
- Eight out of 500?

11:03.038 --> 11:06.792
Elena, statistically, genius occurs
once in 10,000 individuals.

11:07.167 --> 11:11.004
We expected only five geniuses
from the Pasadena Orphanage.

11:11.255 --> 11:12.172
We've got eight.

11:12.631 --> 11:14.107
Don't tell me how well we're doing.

11:14.258 --> 11:18.303
Our orphanages and secret labs
are costing us 200 million a year.

11:18.554 --> 11:23.308
The sole purpose of these orphanages is
to allow us to cull out the geniuses...

11:23.600 --> 11:25.727
- the natural leaders.
- We'll do better.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.355
I'll settle for a few more
like Sylvester.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.524
Look at what that crackerjack did.

11:30.732 --> 11:34.486
All our emphasis has been on
keeping the world out of a secret lab.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.781
No one ever considered
the possibility of a baby escaping.

11:38.031 --> 11:42.452
Just look at this wonderful world we've
created for our babies to grow up in.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.163
Why would anyone
want to escape from here?

11:45.455 --> 11:50.252
The one who did is in the work station,
no doubt planning his next escape.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.177
Hello, Sylvester.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.015
- What's he constructing?
- We don't know.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.309
He builds all kinds
of extraordinary things.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.936
For all kinds of extraordinary purposes.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.980
Just look at that intensity.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.441
There's no other baby like Sylvester.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.276
Well, maybe one.

12:14.735 --> 12:15.903
His twin, Whit?

12:17.362 --> 12:18.447
Whit!

12:20.240 --> 12:21.241
Mayday!

12:22.409 --> 12:24.453
Whitley, where is helper number one?

12:24.703 --> 12:27.080
Give me the lug wrench. Whit, hurry up.

12:27.331 --> 12:28.749
Go! On the double!

12:33.670 --> 12:35.130
Oh, mama!

12:38.717 --> 12:39.801
Mama.

12:41.345 --> 12:42.804
Listen, you monkey.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.640
This is a monkey wrench!

12:44.848 --> 12:47.809
Plumber's helper number one,
you're fired. Get out of town.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.940
What is that terrible noise?

12:54.608 --> 12:55.609
Noise to us.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.570
But the computers analyse
every possible permutation.

12:58.779 --> 13:02.950
What we hear as incoherent noise
may actually be a musical masterpiece.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.495
Listen to our computer's
interpretation of Basil's playing.

13:09.248 --> 13:10.249
That's remarkable.

13:10.457 --> 13:14.127
It has all the complexities
of a symphony by Haydn or Beethoven.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.504
If that's the case...

13:15.921 --> 13:20.425
it's possible that what we hear
as baby talk is actually conversation.

13:20.801 --> 13:25.430
Exactly. And look at this.
A child writing on a pad, right? No.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.641
After checking all languages...

13:27.849 --> 13:30.686
we found out they're writing
the cuneiform language.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.688
They speak their own language.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.023
They understand all others.

13:35.232 --> 13:36.733
Now watch this.

13:40.237 --> 13:43.615
Subject One speaks, and we
immediately see activity here...

13:43.866 --> 13:45.742
in the lower limbic region...

13:45.993 --> 13:48.287
while Subject Two, as he listens...

13:48.579 --> 13:50.664
is active in the forebrain.

13:50.873 --> 13:54.710
These babies are having a conversation.
We just don't understand them.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.963
The instant a child begins
to speak in any known language...

13:58.213 --> 13:59.923
the limbic activity ceases.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.091
As though they forget.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.385
Exactly. Bobbins was right.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.930
What if the limbic activity
is not merely speech?

14:07.389 --> 14:09.016
What if it's stored knowledge...

14:09.266 --> 14:11.393
from an early-parent gene pool?

14:11.643 --> 14:14.104
Passed from generation to generation.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.314
Amazing!

14:15.522 --> 14:17.524
They may know
the secrets of the universe.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.110
The greatest breakthrough in history!

14:20.319 --> 14:21.153
Change humanity!

14:21.403 --> 14:23.780
If we find the key to the human mind...

14:24.114 --> 14:26.491
every child will be
educated in my method.

14:26.992 --> 14:29.703
Every great mind will be ours to mold.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.415
Let's get them all
into the amphitheatre.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.939
Hello, my little baby geniuses.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.150
What are we discussing today?

15:00.609 --> 15:03.904
Could it be postmodern
ethical construction?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.322
How about...

15:06.281 --> 15:08.909
the mechanics of human knowledge?

15:11.620 --> 15:13.539
My little Sly one.

15:15.499 --> 15:16.875
Sly, tell me...

15:18.043 --> 15:19.920
what are you thinking?

15:20.879 --> 15:22.881
Come on. You can look at me.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.801
What are you thinking?

15:26.009 --> 15:27.719
What are you saying?

15:27.970 --> 15:30.722
Enlighten me, my little Einstein.

15:38.021 --> 15:41.024
What do you think?
Should I enlighten her?

15:41.608 --> 15:43.068
She won't understand.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.445
She doesn't speak our language.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.573
But go ahead. Have fun.

15:47.948 --> 15:50.909
Lead us through the wilderness,
my little warrior.

15:51.577 --> 15:54.496
All right, all right. That does it.

15:54.746 --> 15:58.041
Doc, if you're gonna talk
out of your ass all the time...

15:58.292 --> 16:00.586
maybe you should wear
a bow tie on your butt.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.630
Bow tie? On her butt?

16:04.631 --> 16:05.883
On her butt?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.761
That's disgusting, Sylvester.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.140
You know...

16:13.348 --> 16:17.185
you think because I don't understand
you, I don't understand what's going on.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.938
Don't be too sure about that, honey.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.900
Yeah, right. And don't call me honey.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.069
Okay, Sly man, one.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.030
Dr Kinder, zip.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.449
You're always busting her chops.

16:30.699 --> 16:34.912
Are you kidding? Give me a break.
She's Darth Vader in a skirt.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.372
Dr Kinder's our benefactor.

16:37.623 --> 16:40.167
Because of her,
there will be a new order...

16:40.459 --> 16:42.586
and we will be its leaders.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.713
Don't have a cow, Basil.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.548
Why do you talk like that?

16:46.757 --> 16:49.134
Your syntax is atrocious.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.678
It's because he watches TV all the time.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.305
How does he do that?

16:53.847 --> 16:55.515
He converts the monitors.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.476
You ought to all watch TV.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.853
Check out the real world,
like Jerry Springer.

17:00.145 --> 17:00.979
And have fun.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.398
This is exactly what Dr Kinder...

17:03.607 --> 17:05.067
is trying to overcome.

17:05.442 --> 17:06.777
Moral decay.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.987
Now you sound like Heep.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.865
Discipline, discipline, discipline.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.700
Reward and deprive.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.994
Give the babies a crumb. Take it away.

17:17.246 --> 17:21.625
Like Pavlov's dogs. Hold up the bone,
the doggies salivate.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.212
If they behave,
give them a little gristle.

17:25.796 --> 17:26.880
If you don't like it...

17:27.130 --> 17:28.924
why don't you just leave?

17:29.174 --> 17:30.759
He'll just take the next bus.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.929
You're such a weasel, Basil.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.432
Nice face, weasel.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.774
You fool. Dr Heep is watching.

17:46.775 --> 17:49.319
Don't mess with the Sly man, Heepster.

18:01.164 --> 18:02.624
We're back!

18:03.625 --> 18:04.877
Dickie?

18:09.172 --> 18:10.507
Where is he?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.426
Carrie? Whit?

18:13.051 --> 18:14.595
The kids aren't here.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.722
Wait a minute. Hello?

18:17.139 --> 18:18.599
Anybody?

18:21.184 --> 18:23.186
Whit? Is that you?

18:25.898 --> 18:28.358
What's this mess? Look at this water.

18:28.692 --> 18:30.652
No fraternizing with the help!

18:30.903 --> 18:33.572
Carrie, look at you.
You are soaking wet.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.783
You are soaking wet. And look at Whit.

18:40.329 --> 18:42.623
You know what? You two go for a swim...

18:42.915 --> 18:46.501
and Uncle Lenny and I
are gonna have a little talk, okay?

18:47.669 --> 18:50.339
This water here on the floor.
Is it dangerous?

18:50.589 --> 18:52.424
Please. The power's out, anyway.

18:52.674 --> 18:53.592
The power's out?

18:53.884 --> 18:55.594
Great. Where's Dickie?

18:55.844 --> 18:57.012
I don't know.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.851
Nice 'do, Dickie.

19:03.227 --> 19:05.520
You look like Mount Pepto-Bismol
just erupted.

19:05.771 --> 19:07.481
Pink is cosmic, all right?

19:07.731 --> 19:09.816
For the last time, my name ain't Dickie.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.819
It's lce Pick.
Would you people get that straight?

19:13.070 --> 19:14.321
Ice Pick...

19:14.613 --> 19:18.617
I love the creativity and imagination
that you've displayed here...

19:18.867 --> 19:21.662
but no matter how outrageous
you act or you dress...

19:21.912 --> 19:24.039
I'm not gonna fire you.
So give it a rest.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.833
Love you, pal. Grab a mop.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.629
He could use that pink one
he's got on his head.

19:35.342 --> 19:39.096
Don't worry. He's just acting out.
We'll bring him around.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.390
Can you tell me why
we're doing this again?

19:41.640 --> 19:46.520
I promised Dan's brother we'd get him
through one job without getting canned.

19:46.979 --> 19:49.356
I wish I could afford
a makeover like that.

19:50.983 --> 19:54.069
These are the bills
that have to be paid this month...

19:54.319 --> 19:55.946
but this baby...

19:56.154 --> 19:57.781
is actually a check...

19:58.031 --> 20:01.243
made out to your business
for 34 big ones.

20:01.994 --> 20:03.495
Dollars, that is.

20:04.413 --> 20:06.874
Why don't you collect
from some of these stiffs?

20:07.082 --> 20:10.043
Their kids spend more time here
than they do at home.

20:10.252 --> 20:13.672
One ring off Elena's finger,
you could run this place forever.

20:13.922 --> 20:16.758
That being said, I'm resigning.
Effective immediately.

20:17.009 --> 20:19.803
"Ice Pick". I like that,
but it's a little commonplace.

20:20.053 --> 20:24.182
What about "Ice Pick the Great"
or "Saint Ice Pick"?

20:24.433 --> 20:27.686
Or "The Great and Powerful
Wizard of lce Pick"?

20:28.103 --> 20:29.938
Very funny.
Seven on a scale of a thousand.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.982
Nose Pick, let me ask you a question.

20:32.232 --> 20:35.652
Why cut new holes?
Why not close up some of the old ones...

20:35.903 --> 20:37.446
like your mouth?

20:37.905 --> 20:40.532
What is that, an old hippie joke?

20:40.908 --> 20:43.452
Wrong answer.
Don't you kids try that at home.

20:43.744 --> 20:46.747
Margo, don't pull
on Dickie's earring, okay? Grow up.

20:47.998 --> 20:50.834
Ice Pick is right.
Auntie Elena should help.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.086
You're not supposed
to call her "auntie".

20:53.337 --> 20:55.047
- Just Elena.
- What's it matter?

20:55.297 --> 20:57.174
They can't understand me.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.593
He does so much good.
I wish we could help.

20:59.843 --> 21:02.763
I tried. I gave him
that idea subliminally...

21:03.138 --> 21:04.056
about a new wing.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.807
What's that do?

21:06.016 --> 21:09.603
Increase their disposable income
by a factor of four at least.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.863
Honey! Honey.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.407
Did you hear that?
Tell me you heard that.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.493
Whit. He just said, clear as a bell...

21:24.701 --> 21:26.787
"by a factor of four at least".

21:27.037 --> 21:28.205
And I understood it.

21:28.747 --> 21:30.666
This is so great.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.627
It was in their language,
but that was the phrase.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.963
Those were the words,
"by a factor of four".

21:36.213 --> 21:37.923
Beats the hell out of "dada".

21:38.131 --> 21:39.633
- You got it?
- Right here.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.426
- He's got it.
- Let's see it.

21:41.677 --> 21:43.804
Oh, boy, home movies.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.808
He understood our language.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.687
Is that all you have to say?

21:51.937 --> 21:53.480
Okay. Let me think.

21:53.730 --> 21:57.150
He's going to want us to explain
the secrets of the universe.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.403
That could be a real problem.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.992
Well, you're in trouble
again, Sylvester.

22:12.749 --> 22:15.836
Now go to sleep,
or it's Valium for you, pal.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.171
There you are. You got that lock?

22:18.422 --> 22:20.549
I've got the security bonder.

22:20.799 --> 22:23.093
Yeah, right. Okay, Sly man...

22:23.677 --> 22:25.429
I've got that surprise I promised.

22:25.637 --> 22:27.723
Let's see you get out
of this one, Houdini.

22:28.724 --> 22:30.517
Dumb and Dumber.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.185
Lock and load.

23:37.834 --> 23:38.919
Say "cheese".

23:39.628 --> 23:40.796
Cheese!

23:43.382 --> 23:46.176
We're currently experiencing
technical difficulties.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.471
What the hell?

23:51.557 --> 23:53.559
It's too easy.

23:56.770 --> 23:58.021
What do you got?

23:58.355 --> 24:00.816
A temporary loss of transmission
in Quadrant 4.

24:04.945 --> 24:06.029
Lexi?

24:10.033 --> 24:11.118
You're out.

24:11.577 --> 24:12.911
Come with me.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.289
I want to, but I'm too scared.

24:15.664 --> 24:17.249
I'll take you to a mall.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.625
A mall?

24:19.459 --> 24:20.377
Really?

24:22.546 --> 24:23.881
I can't.

24:25.716 --> 24:26.967
Wait a minute.

24:27.843 --> 24:29.970
I heard something. You better go.

24:31.638 --> 24:32.806
Bye.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.101
Take care of yourself.

24:36.852 --> 24:38.103
I'll miss you.

24:47.446 --> 24:49.198
Quadrant 2's down now.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.701
Don't be late, babe.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.662
Five, four, three...

24:56.371 --> 24:58.123
two, one.

25:00.292 --> 25:03.420
Diaper Express. Right on time.

25:19.770 --> 25:21.313
Diaper gravy.

25:23.982 --> 25:26.902
Well, give me liberty or give me death.

25:30.989 --> 25:33.200
Not exactly aromatherapy.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.914
I should've taken death.

25:43.293 --> 25:46.296
Yeah, well, there it is
in plain English.

25:48.257 --> 25:52.970
It sounds like baby talk, but he's
saying, "by a factor of four at least".

25:53.220 --> 25:54.471
How can you tell?

25:54.763 --> 25:59.142
It's like this language that I used to
speak, and I've just forgotten it...

25:59.393 --> 26:00.852
except for once in a while.

26:01.103 --> 26:03.063
I believe you, honey. Really, I do.

26:03.313 --> 26:04.690
Can I go home now?

26:04.898 --> 26:06.984
Yeah, but remember one thing, Nosebleed.

26:07.192 --> 26:09.319
Dennis Rodman can afford
to look like roadkill.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.738
He gets 18 rebounds a game.

26:17.953 --> 26:21.623
Sweet dreams, robo-entertainers.
I don't wanna hear any snoring.

26:21.915 --> 26:22.916
How were the crowds?

26:23.208 --> 26:26.879
20,000 maniacs disguised as kids.
How do you think they were?

26:27.129 --> 26:30.215
We had some glitches with Bunting.
Bring up his schematic.

26:30.465 --> 26:31.842
Coming up.

26:34.344 --> 26:36.805
The world's biggest video game.

26:37.055 --> 26:40.350
The tracking software
needs to be recompiled.

26:40.934 --> 26:43.020
If you don't have any dirty diapers...

26:43.228 --> 26:44.730
Dive, dive!

26:45.230 --> 26:47.774
- Come on. I'm looking bad.
- He tries so hard.

26:48.025 --> 26:52.070
I hope when I go over and speak their
language, I'll remember to thank him.

26:52.321 --> 26:53.739
How could you thank him?

26:53.947 --> 26:58.368
When you cross over, you won't remember
anything you know now.

26:59.244 --> 27:01.622
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.

27:01.955 --> 27:04.499
Have you said "dada" or "mama" yet?

27:04.791 --> 27:07.336
No, that's so stupid. I've decided...

27:07.544 --> 27:11.924
the first time I speak, I'm gonna
quote the Gettysburg Address. Flat out.

27:15.636 --> 27:19.139
No, you gotta say "dada".
Say it. He'll go nuts!

27:19.765 --> 27:22.142
He'll call Mom and they'll both go nuts.

27:22.434 --> 27:23.602
I don't know.

27:23.894 --> 27:26.104
You gotta say it. Come on, do it.

27:28.982 --> 27:30.067
I'll do it.

27:33.654 --> 27:35.239
Dada!

27:43.288 --> 27:45.165
You said "dada".

27:47.167 --> 27:50.254
She said "dada"! I got it on video.

27:50.462 --> 27:52.464
I can't believe it! I missed it!

27:52.714 --> 27:55.509
- Where is she?
- Come on, girl. Where is she?

27:56.176 --> 27:58.011
My little sweetie.

27:58.262 --> 27:59.346
My little doll.

27:59.638 --> 28:01.223
- Told you.
- Say "dada".

28:01.473 --> 28:04.268
- Can you say "mama"?
- Watch this. Mama!

28:05.143 --> 28:06.311
She said it!

28:07.729 --> 28:08.814
She did, she did.

28:16.029 --> 28:18.073
What are you feeding those kids anyway?

28:18.323 --> 28:19.491
Too much.

28:21.243 --> 28:23.120
- Happy trails.
- Okay, take care.

28:30.168 --> 28:31.712
Diaper gravy.

28:43.056 --> 28:44.141
This is awesome!

28:47.811 --> 28:49.229
Where are the chicks?

29:08.832 --> 29:10.876
Hasta la vista, baby.

29:25.224 --> 29:27.309
All right! Look out, world.

29:27.601 --> 29:28.602
Sly man's here!

29:32.648 --> 29:36.151
The night is young. And so am I.

29:42.032 --> 29:43.450
Diaper gravy.

29:50.707 --> 29:52.543
Having that strange feeling again?

29:52.793 --> 29:54.920
Yeah. Like somebody's calling me.

30:02.219 --> 30:05.013
It sure happens a lot.
What are they saying?

30:05.264 --> 30:08.100
I don't know. But it sure is scary.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.387
Whose little boy are you?

30:48.307 --> 30:50.767
- Whit, what's wrong?
- What is it, sweetie?

30:51.059 --> 30:52.060
Hey, come here.

30:53.020 --> 30:54.479
Did something scare you?

30:54.897 --> 30:55.981
Come on.

30:58.650 --> 31:02.070
- Let's take you upstairs.
- It's almost bedtime. Let's go.

31:02.279 --> 31:05.282
Down to the last
cleaning person, you have passed...

31:05.616 --> 31:08.577
the most stringent
security check ever devised!

31:08.785 --> 31:10.871
You each receive salaries 10 times...

31:11.079 --> 31:14.333
that of similar positions
in other companies.

31:14.583 --> 31:15.667
Why?

31:15.918 --> 31:18.587
You are part of the most
momentous experiment...

31:18.837 --> 31:22.424
in the history of corporate
research and development!

31:23.008 --> 31:24.176
You are entrusted...

31:24.509 --> 31:25.761
with that knowledge...

31:26.011 --> 31:29.765
and the responsibility
that goes with it.

31:30.057 --> 31:32.893
And you have failed that responsibility.

31:34.102 --> 31:37.022
Now I don't care how, or what you do.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.858
Get Sylvester back.

31:40.192 --> 31:43.612
Yes, sir, you're someone's
little boy, all right.

31:43.904 --> 31:48.075
And there's going to be a reward,
and I'm going to be the rewardee.

31:48.325 --> 31:51.119
I'm going to take real good care of you.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.997
Reward? Hell, forget reward.

31:54.581 --> 31:57.543
Let's talk ransom.
Yeah, that's what we'll do.

31:58.126 --> 32:00.087
Ransom and easy street.

32:00.671 --> 32:02.589
And if they don't come through...

32:02.839 --> 32:05.133
Well, let's not think about that.

32:05.842 --> 32:07.302
Looking good.

32:16.645 --> 32:19.481
Come back when you're ready
to play in the bigs.

32:21.650 --> 32:23.527
I gotta get a disguise.

32:34.705 --> 32:36.290
Good evening.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.418
Good evening.

32:40.377 --> 32:42.504
What? This is a fashion statement.

32:42.754 --> 32:43.589
You see that?

32:44.131 --> 32:45.757
It looked like a kid.

32:46.174 --> 32:47.551
That's a baby.

32:48.510 --> 32:50.721
This disguise sucks.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.056
Taxi!

33:07.446 --> 33:08.280
Hey, babe.

33:08.530 --> 33:09.364
Where are we going?

33:09.573 --> 33:13.076
Since I can't walk, I guess we're
going wherever my mother's going.

33:13.368 --> 33:14.536
Is that friendly?

33:14.786 --> 33:17.331
What does this look like?
The welcome wagon?

33:17.581 --> 33:18.749
Look, I got a problem.

33:19.041 --> 33:20.125
Take off your clothes.

33:20.375 --> 33:23.378
Okay, but at least you could
take me to dinner first.

33:23.587 --> 33:25.172
Oy, a comedian.

33:25.422 --> 33:26.256
Yikes!

33:55.702 --> 33:58.830
Who designed this dress?
Larry, Moe and Curly?

34:01.375 --> 34:02.209
Call me.

34:03.877 --> 34:05.837
Oh, no. It's Elena's goons.

34:07.798 --> 34:09.632
Don't forget, I'm listed.

34:12.761 --> 34:15.722
Merry Christmas, Morty.
See you tomorrow.

34:16.306 --> 34:17.139
Good night, boss.

34:20.185 --> 34:22.646
Sure glad she wasn't wearing heels.

34:25.190 --> 34:28.025
One umbrella one Two umbrella two.

34:28.277 --> 34:31.071
- Let's go upstairs to the zoo.
- Good night, Amanda.

34:31.321 --> 34:33.699
Good night, Rachel.

34:33.991 --> 34:35.158
Sweet dreams.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.871
That was beautiful.

34:40.621 --> 34:41.790
Sleep tight, you guys.

34:42.916 --> 34:44.793
Yeah, there we go.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.420
We'll watch them till you come up.

34:48.922 --> 34:50.924
- Why don't we have another?
- What?

34:51.132 --> 34:52.301
Baby.

34:52.592 --> 34:53.927
I tell you what.

34:54.303 --> 34:57.806
You carry it for 41 l2 months and
I'll carry it for 41 l2 months.

34:58.098 --> 35:00.183
Deal. Let's start now.

35:00.434 --> 35:01.768
Honey...

35:03.770 --> 35:05.439
Honey, we adopted Whit...

35:05.647 --> 35:09.234
because we thought that we
couldn't have children of our own.

35:09.526 --> 35:12.696
And then we had Carrie.
She was our little miracle baby.

35:12.946 --> 35:14.781
And miracles can re-occur.

35:15.032 --> 35:17.910
Well, let's not talk
about that right now, okay?

35:18.368 --> 35:19.703
Maybe next year.

35:19.953 --> 35:21.538
Now, sweetheart...

35:21.997 --> 35:25.042
love of my life,
father of my children.

35:26.460 --> 35:30.214
Did you tell Mr. Wilson
that we wanted a $50,000 loan...

35:30.464 --> 35:31.715
for a new wing?

35:31.965 --> 35:33.217
Oh, yeah, that.

35:33.467 --> 35:34.635
Oh, yeah, that.

35:34.843 --> 35:37.971
- I meant to show you something.
- We're behind on the mortgage.

35:38.222 --> 35:40.057
We have to go to the bank and beg.

35:40.474 --> 35:42.476
I just want you to look at some numbers.

35:42.726 --> 35:46.730
Right now we get $300 a month for each
baby in the research program, right?

35:46.980 --> 35:49.441
Right. If we take in 10 more babies...

35:49.983 --> 35:53.737
we qualify as a Chapter 40
research corporation...

35:53.987 --> 35:55.781
and then we get $900 a baby.

35:56.031 --> 35:57.366
Nine hundred?

35:57.616 --> 35:58.617
So...

35:58.867 --> 36:00.744
the 10 new babies, our six...

36:01.453 --> 36:04.957
that's 14,400 a month,
2,000 a month for the loan.

36:05.207 --> 36:08.252
Even with more help,
we'll still operate above break-even.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.754
We can do more research,
take in more babies...

36:11.380 --> 36:12.381
lose less money.

36:12.673 --> 36:15.509
This is amazing.
This actually makes sense.

36:16.552 --> 36:17.636
Wait a minute.

36:17.928 --> 36:21.515
You don't have a single cell in your
entire brain devoted to business.

36:21.765 --> 36:23.141
How did you come up with this?

36:25.102 --> 36:27.312
Actually, I don't think I did.

36:27.771 --> 36:29.356
I think it was...

36:29.606 --> 36:30.440
Whit.

36:31.733 --> 36:33.277
Whit told you this business plan?

36:33.527 --> 36:37.781
Well, not tell exactly.
It was just... It came to me.

36:38.031 --> 36:40.325
When I was working with him,
it kind of...

36:40.659 --> 36:43.704
jumped out of his brain
and landed in mine.

36:44.121 --> 36:46.123
I went to the pamphlets. It works.

36:47.499 --> 36:49.459
Kid knows his business.

36:50.711 --> 36:52.462
Got some better news.

36:53.672 --> 36:54.673
What?

36:54.882 --> 36:58.302
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house...

36:58.552 --> 37:01.972
not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

37:02.222 --> 37:03.140
Or a kid.

37:03.432 --> 37:05.559
Or a toddler.

37:18.488 --> 37:22.242
Okay, Charlie, they're all out
for the night. Lock it up.

37:24.578 --> 37:26.580
Sly's in the house!

37:26.830 --> 37:28.207
King of the mall!

37:28.832 --> 37:29.666
Macy's.

37:30.709 --> 37:32.920
Damn! I didn't bring
my credit cards.

37:35.380 --> 37:36.381
Shop till you drop.

37:42.721 --> 37:46.225
Video games. My kingdom
for some video games.

37:49.728 --> 37:51.104
What have I got?

38:03.116 --> 38:04.034
Baby Guess.

38:04.284 --> 38:05.994
I can get out of drag.

38:14.169 --> 38:15.337
Smoking!

38:27.558 --> 38:29.226
He shoots. He scores!

39:24.615 --> 39:27.826
- World Facts for 800, please.
- Answer.. Daily Double.

39:28.577 --> 39:29.828
You're close to the lead.

39:30.037 --> 39:33.624
Donna moved ahead a while ago,
but you're just $100 away.

39:33.874 --> 39:35.250
I'll wager 1,100, please.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.462
For a $1,000 lead,
here's the clue in World Facts.

39:38.712 --> 39:43.008
"Discovered by David Livingstone,
Botswana's Lake Ngami...

39:43.217 --> 39:45.969
lies in the northern part
of this desert".

39:46.220 --> 39:47.304
What is the Kalahari?

39:48.096 --> 39:49.014
What is the Gobi?

39:49.348 --> 39:50.974
No. Wrong part of the world.

39:51.225 --> 39:52.768
What is the Kalahari?

39:52.976 --> 39:55.854
All right, that takes you
to 4,800. Pick again.

39:58.106 --> 39:59.691
Do you think we've lived before?

39:59.942 --> 40:02.152
I don't know, honey. That's your area.

40:02.694 --> 40:05.656
The Tibetans believe that
when we're born again...

40:05.906 --> 40:08.951
we retain universal knowledge
for the first two years.

40:09.201 --> 40:11.954
Then we learn to talk
and we forget it all.

40:12.204 --> 40:13.580
They call it "crossing over".

40:13.830 --> 40:16.750
I'm doing a crossword here.
Universal knowledge can wait.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.168
No, just think.

40:19.294 --> 40:22.548
What if our babies
have all the answers to life?

40:22.798 --> 40:26.843
I'd settle for 28 across. What was it
that Miss Muffet sat on again?

40:27.094 --> 40:28.554
Her tuffet.

40:29.930 --> 40:32.015
What the hell is a tuffet anyway?

40:32.558 --> 40:33.809
You got me.

40:34.810 --> 40:38.647
When you tap into universal knowledge,
you find out and let me know.

40:46.196 --> 40:49.408
Lexi, you should've been here, kid.

41:17.436 --> 41:20.355
What? You never heard
of Weight Watchers?

41:20.772 --> 41:22.232
Diaper rodeo!

41:23.650 --> 41:25.152
On your mark. Get set. Go!

41:34.328 --> 41:36.622
- Here goes Old Faithful.
- Sprang a leak!

41:36.955 --> 41:38.332
Come here, sweetie.

41:41.418 --> 41:42.878
- A winner.
- Time!

41:43.545 --> 41:46.089
Rotator cuff, rotator cuff injury.

42:04.107 --> 42:08.570
May the wrath of Shiva descend upon you.

42:08.820 --> 42:11.198
Stick to your rapping, Ice Shtick...

42:11.490 --> 42:14.743
and leave the wisecracks
to the people with IQs over 40.

42:15.285 --> 42:17.329
It's not rap. It's mantra.

42:17.663 --> 42:21.416
Junior, I was chanting mantras
before you were born.

42:23.418 --> 42:26.547
You were chanting mantras
before Buddha was born.

42:27.297 --> 42:28.465
Pretty...

42:29.091 --> 42:30.342
That's pretty good.

42:30.926 --> 42:32.636
Christmas shopping. Pray for me.

42:32.886 --> 42:34.513
Want me to take the kids?

42:34.763 --> 42:37.432
You can leave Carrie.
I'm going to run some stats.

42:37.683 --> 42:38.850
Okay, come here.

42:43.772 --> 42:45.566
You're going to love it.

42:45.941 --> 42:48.819
That's a car. You can't
have a car for Christmas.

42:49.069 --> 42:53.115
It's a little too expensive. Well,
maybe a little dinky car would be good.

43:07.838 --> 43:11.592
What the hell was that?
I think I just had a kid.

43:29.776 --> 43:31.570
Babyco 1, he's been spotted.

43:31.904 --> 43:33.447
He's heading your way.

43:36.533 --> 43:37.868
Busted.

44:00.390 --> 44:02.267
Right up to the tunnel.

44:02.517 --> 44:03.352
Go on.

44:16.573 --> 44:17.407
We're on him.

44:32.673 --> 44:34.132
Hey, buddy.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.097
Come on, kid.

44:40.305 --> 44:41.640
Give it up.

44:48.814 --> 44:51.024
I hope you got a kick out of that.

45:15.424 --> 45:16.758
Whittie, you there?

45:19.011 --> 45:20.345
Over here.

45:22.514 --> 45:23.891
Sweetie?

45:24.474 --> 45:26.101
You still in there?

45:26.810 --> 45:27.978
Where'd he go?

45:39.823 --> 45:42.117
What was that scream? Was that you?

45:42.784 --> 45:44.745
Sweetie, what are you looking at?

45:47.164 --> 45:50.167
I thought we dressed you in overalls.
That's strange.

45:52.377 --> 45:53.837
My little sugar.

45:54.546 --> 45:55.964
Were you scared again?

45:56.215 --> 46:00.636
Come on. I know what's gonna
cheer you up. Mommy knows.

46:19.196 --> 46:20.447
Tears?

46:20.822 --> 46:24.159
Could this be guilt
for threatening our great work?

46:27.162 --> 46:28.080
Put him down.

46:32.417 --> 46:33.961
I want you to see this boy...

46:34.169 --> 46:37.673
who has jeopardized
everything we've worked for.

46:40.551 --> 46:41.802
Serves him right.

46:42.052 --> 46:46.306
Why don't you go talk to your computers,
Basil? They understand you.

46:46.515 --> 46:47.891
They don't like him either.

46:48.100 --> 46:50.394
All right, Sylvester, go to your room.

46:50.644 --> 46:52.271
We'll settle this later.

46:54.898 --> 46:58.318
For heaven's sakes,
someone get him out of my sight!

47:13.792 --> 47:17.546
I've never seen him like this before.
Go run some of that off, honey.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.214
Watch out for that rope.

47:19.464 --> 47:23.927
You know, I gave him a couple of slurps
of my ice cream and he just went nuts.

47:26.847 --> 47:28.015
Dan, come out here.

47:33.020 --> 47:36.231
I don't know what you feed him,
but where can I get some?

47:39.401 --> 47:40.485
How does he do that?

47:45.407 --> 47:48.285
Sugar high. You should've seen him
at Baskin-Robbins.

47:48.535 --> 47:50.495
We've been banned for life.

47:56.919 --> 47:58.879
Well, he seems okay.

48:00.047 --> 48:01.798
I'll have a talk with him.

48:15.187 --> 48:17.272
What is wrong with you?

48:17.814 --> 48:20.776
I'm the executive director
of a madhouse.

48:30.327 --> 48:31.578
What's wrong?

48:38.710 --> 48:40.462
Nothing ever scares Sly.

48:41.838 --> 48:43.840
I just want him to stop crying.

48:47.844 --> 48:49.972
She's still upset, honey.

48:50.264 --> 48:53.058
It's all right.
Just go to sleep, Carrie.

48:53.600 --> 48:55.227
You'll be all right.

48:55.602 --> 48:58.063
- There we are.
- Okay, you sleep tight.

49:01.733 --> 49:04.862
First Whit, and now Carrie.
Must be contagious.

49:07.948 --> 49:09.491
Night, guys.

49:11.326 --> 49:13.453
Had any of those weird feelings lately?

49:13.704 --> 49:15.289
- What?
- You heard me.

49:15.539 --> 49:17.332
Lighten up, will you?

49:17.541 --> 49:18.709
You're not my brother.

49:18.959 --> 49:21.420
You fooled my mom and dad,
but you don't fool me.

49:21.670 --> 49:22.754
What do you mean?

49:23.422 --> 49:25.632
- You're not my brother.
- Don't be dumb.

49:29.386 --> 49:30.470
Jerk.

49:31.054 --> 49:32.431
She's gonna be trouble.

49:43.025 --> 49:45.152
Play. I'll be watching you.

49:47.196 --> 49:49.114
Want to swing? I'll push you.

49:50.365 --> 49:51.533
I don't want to.

49:52.075 --> 49:53.619
Tell us what happened.

49:54.661 --> 49:57.331
I was at the playground with my mom...

49:57.581 --> 49:58.582
With your what?

49:58.832 --> 50:00.334
He's delusional.

50:00.542 --> 50:02.669
You're such a putz, Basil.

50:03.045 --> 50:03.879
Ignore him.

50:04.213 --> 50:05.380
Go on.

50:05.797 --> 50:09.968
And I climbed up the slide
and I bumped into this other kid...

50:10.344 --> 50:12.888
and when I got up, it was me.

50:13.347 --> 50:15.015
What do you mean, it was you?

50:15.807 --> 50:18.810
The other boy. He looked just like me.

50:20.354 --> 50:21.355
What's your name?

50:21.897 --> 50:23.440
Whit.

50:23.732 --> 50:24.900
Oh, boy.

50:32.366 --> 50:35.035
Don't worry, Whit.
It'll be all right.

50:35.285 --> 50:37.955
Dr Kinder will take you
back to your mother.

50:38.288 --> 50:39.998
She'll do no such thing.

50:40.207 --> 50:41.291
Don't you see?

50:41.500 --> 50:44.878
Dr Kinder arranged
for the Bobbins to adopt Whit...

50:45.128 --> 50:46.547
for just this purpose.

50:46.797 --> 50:49.424
A twin progressive,
comparative experimentation.

50:49.925 --> 50:51.468
What's he talking about?

50:51.802 --> 50:54.179
We don't know, and we're geniuses.

50:54.471 --> 50:57.391
It means Dr Kinder
let that quack, Bobbins...

50:57.599 --> 51:00.143
raise Whit while
she raised Sylvester...

51:00.477 --> 51:03.647
to demonstrate the superiority...

51:04.481 --> 51:05.816
of the Kinder method.

51:06.066 --> 51:09.403
And wait till she finds out
the twins have been switched.

51:09.736 --> 51:14.700
She'll realize she has an opportunity
for a living cross-evaluation.

51:15.284 --> 51:16.201
He's at it again.

51:17.119 --> 51:19.913
Obviously Sly, swine though he is...

51:20.122 --> 51:22.332
is superior to this Whit individual.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.084
Gee, thanks.

51:24.626 --> 51:26.712
- She wouldn't do that.
- Do what?

51:26.962 --> 51:30.549
Keep a child from its mother
just to prove her theory.

51:30.841 --> 51:32.509
Oh, really?

51:34.511 --> 51:36.388
Get Dr Kinder down here.

51:37.389 --> 51:38.932
Tell me, who is this?

51:39.183 --> 51:42.186
That's Sylvester.
His brain synapses fire at a rate...

51:42.394 --> 51:44.204
of about 40bondekbondek1bondek2
above normal.

51:44.354 --> 51:46.481
So that's Sly, right?

51:47.816 --> 51:48.734
Look at this...

51:48.942 --> 51:50.527
little person's voiceprint.

51:51.653 --> 51:52.487
So?

51:53.447 --> 51:57.284
Compare it to this voiceprint
taken from Sly last week.

51:58.619 --> 51:59.870
Oh, my God!

52:01.121 --> 52:02.456
Oh, my God, no.

52:05.667 --> 52:07.461
Those imbeciles!

52:13.550 --> 52:14.468
Sly?

52:17.638 --> 52:18.889
Whit?

52:21.850 --> 52:23.644
You idiots!

52:25.062 --> 52:26.396
You imbeciles!

52:26.647 --> 52:27.648
You morons!

52:27.981 --> 52:30.108
- You cretins! You, you...
- Boring.

52:31.235 --> 52:32.569
Traitors.

52:35.948 --> 52:37.032
No, not...

52:37.282 --> 52:38.534
idiots, no.

52:41.078 --> 52:42.621
You wonderful...

52:43.247 --> 52:45.374
brilliant assemblage.

52:46.208 --> 52:50.045
You have given me the greatest gift
of my entire life...

52:50.420 --> 52:53.423
our own living cross-evaluation!

52:54.216 --> 52:55.384
Told you.

52:56.009 --> 52:56.843
Brown nose.

52:59.054 --> 53:00.305
Give them all a raise.

53:00.597 --> 53:01.682
Brilliant.

53:01.974 --> 53:03.725
I feel so warm and motherly.

53:04.226 --> 53:06.353
I think I'll go visit my darling niece.

53:06.645 --> 53:08.188
And the mother of the year is...

53:09.481 --> 53:11.692
Start the comparative tests on Whit.

53:11.942 --> 53:14.736
We'll see how Sylvester's
doing among the peasants.

53:14.987 --> 53:16.655
How can she do this?

53:17.072 --> 53:17.990
Don't you understand?

53:18.240 --> 53:20.701
Dr Kinder is acting
for the greater good.

53:21.159 --> 53:24.204
Maybe it's all right for us,
but Whit has a mom and dad.

53:24.413 --> 53:25.581
What's wrong with you?

53:26.248 --> 53:28.458
She's not going to keep Whit forever.

53:30.711 --> 53:31.712
Yeah, sure, Basil.

53:32.379 --> 53:34.756
This is Dr Kinder
we're talking about...

53:35.424 --> 53:37.467
not Dr Frankenstein.

53:42.347 --> 53:43.348
Teddie, what is it?

53:44.099 --> 53:45.601
I feel funny.

53:46.643 --> 53:48.020
What's wrong?

53:48.979 --> 53:50.314
She's crossing over.

53:50.522 --> 53:52.441
She's going to be one
of the grownups now.

53:52.774 --> 53:55.402
Don't worry. This is the way
it's supposed to be.

53:55.652 --> 53:57.196
You'll all cross over soon.

53:57.779 --> 53:58.947
Bye.

53:59.740 --> 54:00.991
Don't go, Teddie.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.910
My God, look at that.

54:03.118 --> 54:05.996
Two years old and the limbic activity
is slowing down.

54:06.246 --> 54:09.583
The frontal lobes are taking over.
We were right.

54:10.209 --> 54:11.835
Will she remember us?

54:13.212 --> 54:15.172
No, she's one of them now.

54:15.714 --> 54:17.591
Dan, we can't be late.

54:17.841 --> 54:20.969
They're late. They're late
for a very important date.

54:21.178 --> 54:25.015
Your mom and dad are off trying
to save the farm. Hip, hip, hooray!

54:25.265 --> 54:27.643
Oh, you sweethearts. Thank you.

54:27.935 --> 54:29.770
Thanks, all of you.

54:30.020 --> 54:31.522
Here, you take her.

54:31.772 --> 54:33.440
My little angel.

54:34.483 --> 54:35.484
Who's there?

54:35.734 --> 54:36.568
Let's go see.

54:41.198 --> 54:44.785
Come on. I'll make you breakfast.
Pancakes in the shape of a witch.

54:45.035 --> 54:48.413
Still getting your help
from the work-release program, I see.

54:51.041 --> 54:54.169
Give Dr Kinder a nice big kiss.

54:59.174 --> 55:00.592
Very nice.

55:03.804 --> 55:05.722
I love coming to this house.

55:06.223 --> 55:08.892
There's just something
about it that's so...

55:11.645 --> 55:12.563
homey.

55:12.813 --> 55:15.440
- We were just going out.
- You were going out?

55:17.317 --> 55:20.445
Tell me, how is Whit?
Is he talking yet?

55:20.654 --> 55:24.825
Actually, two days ago we had
some communication in pre-language talk.

55:25.409 --> 55:26.410
Really?

55:27.077 --> 55:28.537
We caught it on video.

55:28.745 --> 55:30.122
On video?

55:31.123 --> 55:33.333
I've translated several whole sentences.

55:35.377 --> 55:36.879
Whole sentences?

55:37.713 --> 55:39.089
I have a wonderful idea.

55:39.548 --> 55:42.301
Why don't we take Whit to the lab?
With your gift...

55:42.509 --> 55:44.261
for pre-language...

55:44.469 --> 55:47.890
and our technology,
I'm sure we can skip a step or two.

55:49.016 --> 55:49.850
What?

55:55.981 --> 55:57.566
Slow down, pal. What?

55:58.025 --> 55:59.026
Don't do it.

56:00.903 --> 56:02.821
What? What'd he say?

56:03.488 --> 56:04.573
"Don't do it".

56:05.157 --> 56:06.241
That's ridiculous.

56:06.533 --> 56:07.784
What are you saying?

56:08.035 --> 56:09.411
They've got Whit.

56:10.454 --> 56:12.039
Wait a minute.

56:12.247 --> 56:14.625
Who's got Whit? You're Whit.

56:16.084 --> 56:18.545
- Go on.
- Can't.

56:19.463 --> 56:20.714
That's all I'm getting.

56:21.840 --> 56:23.258
Isn't that amazing?

56:24.051 --> 56:27.638
I must be running along. I have
some serious, important matters...

56:28.263 --> 56:31.016
that I have to attend to.
Goodbye, Whit.

56:37.773 --> 56:40.317
Hives. She's up to something.

56:40.734 --> 56:43.654
- What is going on with you today?
- We got to go.

56:43.987 --> 56:46.073
You okay, sweetie?
You look a little sad.

56:46.281 --> 56:47.449
We do have to go.

56:48.242 --> 56:50.202
Carrie, go back with the babies.

56:53.705 --> 56:56.166
Get me Dr Heep
on the phone immediately.

56:56.416 --> 56:59.586
I don't care what he's doing.
Get him on the phone now!

57:01.964 --> 57:05.217
Jonathan, I want two of our best men
sent down here now.

57:05.467 --> 57:07.511
No! You idiot. No, listen to me.

57:07.761 --> 57:10.222
Dan is beginning to understand
both of them.

57:10.430 --> 57:12.516
And if he does, then we go to prison.

57:12.766 --> 57:14.977
We have to have them both.
We can't switch them.

57:16.186 --> 57:18.856
I want you to rest here
a little minute, okay?

57:20.274 --> 57:22.276
Here we go. There you go.

57:50.762 --> 57:52.431
Margo will be right back.

57:53.932 --> 57:56.059
Keep an eye on that boy now.

57:59.646 --> 58:01.398
You want to tell us about it?

58:01.648 --> 58:02.900
Yeah, I guess so.

58:03.734 --> 58:04.568
What now?

58:04.860 --> 58:06.403
You have to ask? It's the power.

58:06.653 --> 58:09.781
If this house was a dog,
we'd have it put to sleep.

58:15.954 --> 58:20.250
Well, would you look at that.
The sun is setting in that boy's pants.

58:20.500 --> 58:21.835
He wishes.

58:23.962 --> 58:25.714
Nice work there, Dickie.

58:26.256 --> 58:27.257
Real classy.

58:27.549 --> 58:28.550
So I'm fired, right?

58:28.800 --> 58:32.304
Fat chance. Change your shirt
and check on the babies.

58:36.642 --> 58:38.685
A lot of Van Gogh in that kid.

58:38.977 --> 58:40.437
His ear is still intact.

58:40.687 --> 58:42.981
- You're weird.
- Check on the power.

58:44.149 --> 58:46.443
You just let them take your brother?

58:46.735 --> 58:49.279
- It didn't even bother you?
- It bothered me.

58:50.030 --> 58:53.283
There just wasn't anything
I could do to help him.

59:01.500 --> 59:05.254
We're tracing the power outage,
and this property may be the source.

59:05.504 --> 59:08.840
- What can we do to help?
- We need access to your hookup.

59:09.675 --> 59:12.553
Ray, why don't you check the basement?
I'll look upstairs.

59:12.803 --> 59:14.513
What's going on? Who is that?

59:14.763 --> 59:16.849
It's Elena's goons. They're after me.

59:17.057 --> 59:18.308
Into the bedroom. Hurry up.

59:18.559 --> 59:19.893
What's a goon?

59:20.519 --> 59:22.813
So how long have you been
into self-mutilation?

59:23.105 --> 59:24.189
We all need a hobby.

59:24.439 --> 59:26.358
How many bedrooms on this floor?

59:26.608 --> 59:27.985
- Four.
- And on the third floor?

59:28.235 --> 59:29.069
Five.

59:29.278 --> 59:32.865
I want you to go down, get my partner
and tell him I need a hand.

59:33.156 --> 59:34.783
Keep an eye on the babies.

59:35.033 --> 59:35.951
My pleasure.

59:36.159 --> 59:40.789
Brilliant, Dickie. Why didn't you
just stuff me in a suitcase for him?

59:41.039 --> 59:42.291
Close the door.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:27.169
You must be Sylvester.

01:00:27.419 --> 01:00:29.713
I heard about you and your karate.

01:00:29.963 --> 01:00:31.465
I'm a black belt.

01:00:31.882 --> 01:00:32.966
Care to try me, son?

01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:37.471
I'd be too scared.

01:00:42.392 --> 01:00:45.187
Now, I guess you expect me
to step over this ski...

01:00:45.437 --> 01:00:49.024
and you'll jump on the end,
and the end will hit me in the gonads.

01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:52.444
I'll scream and fall down the stairs.
Is that right?

01:00:54.863 --> 01:00:57.991
I think you've been seeing
too many bad movies, pal.

01:00:58.242 --> 01:01:00.953
Because I'm just going
to step around the ski.

01:01:01.995 --> 01:01:04.289
Just how stupid do you think I am?

01:01:09.002 --> 01:01:10.712
Pretty stupid.

01:01:15.133 --> 01:01:17.344
Gee, I bet that felt good.

01:01:27.396 --> 01:01:28.313
What happened?

01:01:28.897 --> 01:01:31.608
Sly kicked him right
in the forbidden zone.

01:01:40.325 --> 01:01:41.326
What's going on?

01:01:41.618 --> 01:01:45.122
A work-related injury.
I better go up and see what happened.

01:01:56.758 --> 01:01:57.759
Tough guy, eh?

01:01:59.177 --> 01:02:00.179
Well...

01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:02.598
you're about to meet
your worst nightmare.

01:02:02.848 --> 01:02:05.142
Goon, that is some lame dialogue.

01:02:09.062 --> 01:02:11.607
You really think I'm gonna
walk over that ski...

01:02:11.857 --> 01:02:13.650
and you're gonna jump...

01:02:13.901 --> 01:02:16.361
and that ski's gonna
hit me in the gonads...

01:02:16.653 --> 01:02:20.032
and I'm gonna scream
and make a funny face and fall?

01:02:20.657 --> 01:02:21.491
I don't think so.

01:02:25.787 --> 01:02:27.289
Cross your legs and smile.

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.644
You don't mess with the Sly man.

01:02:54.316 --> 01:02:56.443
Driver! Babyco, right away.

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:01.990
Jonathan, I want the laboratory
stripped. Disappear. Understand?

01:03:02.282 --> 01:03:03.617
I want bare walls.

01:03:08.121 --> 01:03:11.792
You told me before that Whit
used to get weird feelings.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.835
Like someone was calling him.

01:03:14.086 --> 01:03:15.879
I think that was me.

01:03:18.423 --> 01:03:20.801
All right, sit on the floor in a circle.

01:03:21.051 --> 01:03:23.011
Sit on the floor? In a circle?

01:03:23.262 --> 01:03:25.097
What part don't you understand?

01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:28.350
Bare walls! I want this place
stripped in three hours.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.310
Suppose he does break through?

01:03:30.519 --> 01:03:32.646
Nobody will be able
to understand Sylvester.

01:03:32.938 --> 01:03:34.189
Who'll believe Bobbins?

01:03:34.439 --> 01:03:38.694
All he has to do is take Sylvester to
the hospital where the twins were born.

01:03:38.944 --> 01:03:42.030
Would you be careful?
And ask for a handprint validation.

01:03:42.281 --> 01:03:44.658
After that, they'll know
they've got Sly.

01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:49.037
And my darling niece will have
the police here in less than an hour!

01:03:49.288 --> 01:03:52.040
Bare walls! Bare walls in three hours!

01:03:52.249 --> 01:03:55.210
- Move it!
- What are you doing? Get a move on!

01:03:55.627 --> 01:03:56.461
What's he doing?

01:03:57.170 --> 01:04:00.257
Dr Kinder's not taking him
back to his parents.

01:04:01.008 --> 01:04:02.551
I don't believe it.

01:04:03.468 --> 01:04:05.095
Not Dr Frankenstein, huh?

01:04:07.139 --> 01:04:10.475
She's gonna move him tonight.
We've got to help.

01:04:10.726 --> 01:04:11.894
They're coming.

01:04:12.186 --> 01:04:13.020
Who's coming?

01:04:13.228 --> 01:04:16.440
Sly and the kids.
They're coming to break us out.

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:18.275
- When?
- Tonight.

01:04:18.483 --> 01:04:21.403
We could cross over at any time,
and then she wins.

01:04:22.279 --> 01:04:24.573
Either you're with her or with us.

01:04:24.865 --> 01:04:26.241
We're with you.

01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:27.910
Basil, decide.

01:04:28.577 --> 01:04:30.162
Decide now.

01:04:31.413 --> 01:04:33.123
Let's kick butt!

01:04:33.749 --> 01:04:35.125
He's with us.

01:04:45.469 --> 01:04:47.596
I think we've got company.

01:04:58.273 --> 01:05:00.734
Come on. The mind's
a terrible thing to waste.

01:05:05.697 --> 01:05:07.407
Come on, troops. Move it.

01:05:09.952 --> 01:05:11.203
What are we gonna do?

01:05:11.495 --> 01:05:14.748
- We're gonna train.
- We're going on a train!

01:05:16.917 --> 01:05:18.168
Oy vey!

01:05:18.377 --> 01:05:19.878
Up, down, up, down...

01:05:20.128 --> 01:05:21.129
This is pathetic.

01:05:21.338 --> 01:05:24.633
Hut, two, three, four...

01:05:25.926 --> 01:05:29.680
You call those jumping jacks?
More like jumping jerks.

01:05:29.888 --> 01:05:31.223
Stop! Stop!

01:05:33.517 --> 01:05:34.893
Stop!

01:05:35.894 --> 01:05:37.145
Hold it!

01:05:39.648 --> 01:05:40.899
This isn't working.

01:05:41.525 --> 01:05:42.693
What do you expect?

01:05:42.985 --> 01:05:44.903
We're geniuses, not ninjas.

01:05:45.404 --> 01:05:48.490
Dig deeper, guys.
I need warriors. Now move out.

01:05:50.075 --> 01:05:53.245
Under the net. Under the net!

01:05:53.453 --> 01:05:54.538
What?

01:06:04.798 --> 01:06:06.508
Move! Move! Move!

01:06:10.846 --> 01:06:12.181
Karate.

01:06:17.102 --> 01:06:18.270
Hopeless.

01:06:27.905 --> 01:06:30.908
Now let's concentrate.
Okay, one at a time.

01:06:31.158 --> 01:06:33.535
One at a time! One at a time!

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.205
This is harder than I thought.

01:06:42.044 --> 01:06:44.046
It's my turn.

01:06:52.137 --> 01:06:53.055
Perfect.

01:06:55.057 --> 01:06:56.975
Absolutely perfect.

01:06:58.185 --> 01:07:01.104
All right, we have to use
our secret weapon.

01:07:01.939 --> 01:07:03.565
And what's that?

01:07:03.899 --> 01:07:06.026
Duby, what is it adults fear most...

01:07:06.235 --> 01:07:07.986
- about babies?
- Dirty diapers.

01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:09.988
You're wrong.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.450
They make those stupid faces
when they change our diapers.

01:07:14.493 --> 01:07:16.954
Dirty diapers. That's funny.

01:07:19.456 --> 01:07:20.832
It's our intelligence.

01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:23.835
We have to use our intelligence.

01:07:25.754 --> 01:07:26.588
That's it.

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:29.132
All right, everybody. Follow me.

01:07:46.567 --> 01:07:49.278
All right, everybody. Take your places.

01:07:49.486 --> 01:07:50.654
Move it.

01:07:51.238 --> 01:07:52.239
Malcolm, take the flank.

01:07:53.198 --> 01:07:54.992
Joey, over here with us.

01:07:57.953 --> 01:08:00.330
- Sly, do I have time to go potty?
- The potty?

01:08:00.539 --> 01:08:02.833
You're wearing the potty.

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:08.005
Put it on hold.
This is much more important.

01:08:08.255 --> 01:08:09.339
Easy for you to say.

01:08:11.425 --> 01:08:13.051
You are in my power.

01:08:13.427 --> 01:08:15.721
You will obey my commands.

01:08:16.345 --> 01:08:18.098
What are you trying to do?

01:08:18.307 --> 01:08:21.727
I think grownups remember
our language in their subconscious.

01:08:21.977 --> 01:08:22.810
If I'm right...

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.520
I can hypnotize him.

01:08:25.647 --> 01:08:28.108
You are in my power.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.694
You will obey my commands.

01:08:31.111 --> 01:08:34.156
Before I take the babies home...

01:08:34.448 --> 01:08:36.158
I will drive to Babyco.

01:08:36.366 --> 01:08:39.870
Everything depends
on my driving to Babyco.

01:08:40.828 --> 01:08:42.538
You are in my power.

01:08:42.956 --> 01:08:44.832
You will obey my commands.

01:08:46.126 --> 01:08:48.337
Let's see if we've really got him.

01:08:48.587 --> 01:08:50.505
Lenny, raise your arm.

01:08:53.133 --> 01:08:54.384
All right.

01:08:54.676 --> 01:08:56.970
Make him stick out his tongue.

01:08:57.888 --> 01:08:59.305
Stick out your tongue.

01:09:03.894 --> 01:09:06.020
Make him wiggle his tongue.

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:10.776
Now, wiggle your tongue.

01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:19.701
Sly, make him pick his nose. Go on.

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:21.870
Come on, Sly. Make him pick it.

01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:23.788
That's gross.

01:09:24.915 --> 01:09:27.292
- Make him.
- Make him pick his nose.

01:09:27.917 --> 01:09:29.169
Pick your nose now.

01:09:30.127 --> 01:09:31.296
Pick it. Pick it.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.057
When I snap my fingers...

01:09:43.058 --> 01:09:44.142
you'll wake up.

01:09:45.727 --> 01:09:48.689
Lenny, wake up.
Time to take the kids home.

01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:52.192
Get their jackets on them.
We leave here in 30 minutes.

01:09:52.442 --> 01:09:53.359
I'm up!

01:09:53.986 --> 01:09:55.612
All right, move out.

01:09:57.155 --> 01:09:59.157
Where is that...?

01:10:06.498 --> 01:10:08.876
Boy, this is not your lunch break.

01:10:10.711 --> 01:10:13.088
All right, lce Pick. Hop to it.

01:10:27.769 --> 01:10:29.104
Come on, Carrie.

01:10:29.354 --> 01:10:30.522
Aren't you coming?

01:10:30.772 --> 01:10:32.900
No, I got a job to do here.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.611
I don't know but I've been told

01:10:35.861 --> 01:10:38.071
Eskimo girls are mighty cold

01:10:38.447 --> 01:10:40.574
Dr Kinder is a son of a gun

01:10:40.908 --> 01:10:43.118
Got cooties and they weigh a ton

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:46.121
One, two, three, four One, two

01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:47.247
Three, four.

01:10:47.539 --> 01:10:49.833
- We got it! We got it, Margo!
- We did it!

01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:51.376
Where is everybody?

01:10:53.045 --> 01:10:55.422
You got what? An eviction notice?

01:10:55.714 --> 01:10:58.509
We get the whole ball of wax.
The loan, everything.

01:10:58.759 --> 01:11:00.469
We find out tomorrow.
Where is everybody?

01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:02.596
Out delivering the kids.

01:11:02.846 --> 01:11:04.014
Is everything okay?

01:11:04.264 --> 01:11:06.558
I don't know.
Something weird's going on.

01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:08.310
I got a bad feeling.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.561
Mrs. Dexter?

01:11:10.479 --> 01:11:11.730
He hasn't?

01:11:12.231 --> 01:11:14.107
Randy hasn't gotten home yet.

01:11:14.358 --> 01:11:17.236
- Okay. I'll get right on it.
- It's late.

01:11:22.533 --> 01:11:24.243
Mrs. Walters?

01:11:25.953 --> 01:11:28.664
I know. Well, we're checking into it.

01:11:28.914 --> 01:11:30.332
It's probably a flat tire.

01:11:30.582 --> 01:11:32.417
Okay, I'll phone you back.

01:11:34.211 --> 01:11:35.212
I'll phone the bus.

01:11:38.966 --> 01:11:39.800
Bobbins' bus.

01:11:41.635 --> 01:11:42.553
Where are you?

01:11:44.304 --> 01:11:47.474
We have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

01:11:48.225 --> 01:11:52.145
We have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.531
What did he say?

01:12:02.823 --> 01:12:05.534
They had a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

01:12:05.784 --> 01:12:08.161
Dickie was kind of
saying it along with him.

01:12:08.453 --> 01:12:10.122
Like a song-and-dance team?

01:12:10.372 --> 01:12:12.457
I don't know. They sound like robots.

01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:15.711
What kind of errand could they
possibly have at Babyco?

01:12:20.841 --> 01:12:21.925
What is it, honey?

01:12:24.845 --> 01:12:26.221
Yes, Mrs. Skyla.

01:12:27.681 --> 01:12:30.934
I think she's trying to tell us
something about Whit.

01:12:32.352 --> 01:12:34.479
- He's in the bathroom.
- Quack, quack.

01:12:35.522 --> 01:12:37.316
What are you trying to tell us?

01:12:37.524 --> 01:12:39.359
He went off with a duck?

01:12:42.196 --> 01:12:43.363
What is it, sweetie?

01:12:43.572 --> 01:12:44.406
Babyco.

01:12:46.491 --> 01:12:48.410
Hello. Mrs. Hebutis.

01:12:48.911 --> 01:12:50.996
Concentrate, Daddy.

01:12:51.246 --> 01:12:52.998
You can do it, Daddy.

01:12:54.124 --> 01:12:55.209
Try.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.877
Go on. I'm getting it.

01:12:57.127 --> 01:12:59.171
Connect with your inner child.

01:13:01.089 --> 01:13:03.884
- Try harder. Danger!
- What?

01:13:04.885 --> 01:13:07.804
Whit has a twin brother called Sly.

01:13:08.055 --> 01:13:10.265
He's been here for the last two days.

01:13:10.516 --> 01:13:12.351
- What?
- What "what"?

01:13:12.893 --> 01:13:15.687
Sly and Whit got switched
at the mall.

01:13:15.896 --> 01:13:20.067
And Dr Kinder kept Whit
in her secret lab to experiment on.

01:13:20.567 --> 01:13:21.568
Oh, my God!

01:13:21.818 --> 01:13:24.029
- What?
- She says Elena has a secret lab.

01:13:24.238 --> 01:13:26.448
I don't believe this.
Whit and Sly got switched.

01:13:26.657 --> 01:13:28.492
What? Who's Sly?

01:13:28.742 --> 01:13:32.579
She's getting rid of the lab
and moving the babies to Liechtenstein.

01:13:33.497 --> 01:13:35.541
Liechtenstein? Oh, my God!

01:13:35.832 --> 01:13:37.376
Liechtenstein? What Liechtenstein?

01:13:37.626 --> 01:13:39.211
I'll tell you on the way.

01:13:39.878 --> 01:13:42.256
Sweetie, do you know
all the secrets to life?

01:13:42.464 --> 01:13:45.634
Sure. Piece of cake.
I'll explain when you get back.

01:13:46.593 --> 01:13:49.596
- What's with the Liechtenstein?
- I'll tell you.

01:13:56.979 --> 01:13:59.189
Liechtenstein.
I hate Liechtenstein!

01:14:00.399 --> 01:14:04.319
Hello? 911?
This is an emergency.

01:14:04.528 --> 01:14:08.031
- What is the nature of this emergency?
- There's been a kidnapping.

01:14:08.323 --> 01:14:09.908
And who's been kidnapped?

01:14:10.117 --> 01:14:11.535
My son.

01:14:11.785 --> 01:14:13.996
How old is he?
Who kidnapped him?

01:14:14.288 --> 01:14:17.499
He's almost 2, and his aunt
did it yesterday at the mall.

01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:20.168
His aunt kidnapped him
at the mall yesterday?

01:14:20.419 --> 01:14:22.546
- Right.
- And you're just reporting it?

01:14:22.754 --> 01:14:25.048
She switched him for his twin brother.

01:14:25.299 --> 01:14:26.967
She switched him with his twin?

01:14:28.051 --> 01:14:30.179
- How do you know this?
- My daughter told me.

01:14:30.429 --> 01:14:31.597
How old is she?

01:14:32.097 --> 01:14:33.098
Eighteen months.

01:14:33.307 --> 01:14:35.684
- I know this sounds strange.
- No, sir.

01:14:35.934 --> 01:14:38.395
I get this kind of call all the time.

01:14:39.271 --> 01:14:40.939
Now let me get this straight.

01:14:41.148 --> 01:14:43.942
Your 18-month-old daughter told you...

01:14:44.193 --> 01:14:46.403
that her aunt kidnapped your son...

01:14:46.612 --> 01:14:49.281
by trading him
for his twin at the mall?

01:14:49.865 --> 01:14:51.617
- Is that about it?
- Listen.

01:14:51.825 --> 01:14:55.996
This woman is moving all of the babies
to a secret lab in Liechtenstein!

01:14:56.705 --> 01:14:59.249
A secret lab in Liechtenstein?

01:14:59.791 --> 01:15:01.543
Well, that is serious.

01:15:01.793 --> 01:15:05.964
Give me your name, sir,
and I'll get you all the help you need.

01:15:06.423 --> 01:15:08.467
- She thinks I'm nuts.
- Well, no wonder.

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.761
911?

01:15:11.053 --> 01:15:13.597
Now listen.
You know that Babyco building?

01:15:13.847 --> 01:15:18.185
There's a bomb in there, and we're going
to blow those little suckers to Venus!

01:15:22.105 --> 01:15:24.066
You wanted cops? You got cops.

01:15:26.568 --> 01:15:29.029
The magnificent Sly
and the Bobbins' babies...

01:15:29.279 --> 01:15:32.491
have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:38.872
Security personnel, report to stations.

01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:40.290
What are you doing?

01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:42.668
The magnificent Sly
and the Bobbins' babies...

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.963
have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

01:15:51.134 --> 01:15:52.302
What's up, doc?

01:15:52.594 --> 01:15:53.679
Well, well...

01:15:53.887 --> 01:15:56.265
the resourceful Mr. Sly.

01:15:57.015 --> 01:15:58.976
Go! Go! Move!

01:15:59.309 --> 01:16:02.062
I don't know who
your friends were, Sly...

01:16:02.312 --> 01:16:03.939
but I do know one thing.

01:16:04.523 --> 01:16:06.316
You are mine.

01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:08.777
See you in Joyworld, doc.

01:16:20.914 --> 01:16:23.292
You know the drill. Take your places.

01:16:23.584 --> 01:16:25.794
I'll be in the control centre.
Move out.

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:35.220
Show me the money.

01:16:35.512 --> 01:16:37.306
Fasten your seat belt, doc.

01:16:37.556 --> 01:16:38.974
The ca-ca's gonna hit the fan.

01:16:40.684 --> 01:16:43.604
Okay, robo-entertainers, where are you?

01:16:48.609 --> 01:16:49.526
Beautiful.

01:16:50.194 --> 01:16:51.612
Where are you, big boy?

01:16:53.197 --> 01:16:55.199
Okay, baby, nappy's over.

01:16:55.949 --> 01:16:57.367
Come on, you can do it.

01:16:57.743 --> 01:16:59.203
Give me five.

01:16:59.536 --> 01:17:00.704
That's it. Cool.

01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:04.208
Let's bring up some schematics.

01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:07.836
Great. Now for a little rewiring, boys.

01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:09.504
And then...

01:17:09.713 --> 01:17:11.673
let the games begin.

01:17:12.633 --> 01:17:16.386
Bring my helicopter to the helipad
at the back of Joyworld.

01:17:16.678 --> 01:17:18.972
Hover and descend on my command.

01:17:28.732 --> 01:17:31.360
What can you hope to get from this?

01:17:31.568 --> 01:17:33.862
Just a little satisfaction, doc.

01:17:35.197 --> 01:17:37.491
Okay, let's get ready to move out.

01:17:38.075 --> 01:17:40.452
All right, Sly, come off it.

01:17:40.744 --> 01:17:42.454
I know it's you.

01:17:42.704 --> 01:17:45.082
Okay, brother, make your move.

01:17:51.338 --> 01:17:53.215
All right. The fun is over.

01:17:53.549 --> 01:17:55.676
Okay, boys, let's march.

01:17:58.262 --> 01:17:59.346
Lights...

01:18:01.682 --> 01:18:02.766
camera...

01:18:04.184 --> 01:18:05.018
action!

01:18:14.194 --> 01:18:15.028
Baby...

01:18:15.237 --> 01:18:17.072
want a hug.

01:18:17.614 --> 01:18:19.700
Baby want a hug.

01:18:20.325 --> 01:18:22.119
- Get them, you fool!
- Go!

01:18:23.161 --> 01:18:25.289
Baby want a hug.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.962
What? No hug?

01:18:34.131 --> 01:18:36.675
That make Baby Bunting mad.

01:18:37.134 --> 01:18:38.302
Get the baby!

01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:39.595
Right cross.

01:18:41.013 --> 01:18:42.181
Left hook.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.017
You the one, baby.

01:18:45.225 --> 01:18:47.686
Okay, alien, a little target practice.

01:18:50.731 --> 01:18:52.065
Blew his brains out!

01:18:56.361 --> 01:18:58.155
Merry Christmas!

01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:02.492
And a happy New Year.

01:19:06.121 --> 01:19:09.625
What's the matter with you guys?
These are oversized dolls!

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:10.709
Go, clown.

01:19:11.335 --> 01:19:12.836
You know the drill.

01:19:19.718 --> 01:19:23.013
Lexi, kangaroo. Duby, ostrich.

01:19:28.769 --> 01:19:31.522
Oh, behave, baby!

01:19:37.528 --> 01:19:39.279
Enjoy the ride, suckers!

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:16.275
Not yet.

01:20:16.775 --> 01:20:18.485
Not yet. Now!

01:20:39.464 --> 01:20:40.299
Take him.

01:20:40.591 --> 01:20:43.135
You take him.
I saw what happened last time.

01:20:49.766 --> 01:20:52.227
All right. The Whit man's in the house.

01:20:52.644 --> 01:20:53.812
Get him!

01:21:10.329 --> 01:21:12.039
Basil, out of the park.

01:21:14.333 --> 01:21:16.793
All right, Lexi. Give me five, Basil.

01:21:17.044 --> 01:21:18.712
We're out of here.

01:21:25.177 --> 01:21:27.638
You don't mess with the Sly man, Heep.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.051
Stop! Stop!

01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.262
It's you and me, Sly.

01:22:08.512 --> 01:22:10.305
Mano a mano.

01:22:10.556 --> 01:22:13.642
You're a tremendous
disappointment to me, Sylvester.

01:22:13.892 --> 01:22:17.729
You never understood
the importance of the work.

01:22:18.438 --> 01:22:20.649
Why, you could've known greatness.

01:22:20.899 --> 01:22:23.944
Instead, you're just gonna be another...

01:22:24.444 --> 01:22:25.612
another kid.

01:22:30.826 --> 01:22:33.287
Are you smart enough to keep
your mouth shut?

01:22:36.206 --> 01:22:37.875
Need I say more?

01:22:42.379 --> 01:22:43.463
Et tu, Basil?

01:22:44.214 --> 01:22:45.549
And proud of it.

01:23:04.193 --> 01:23:06.403
Sly, I knew you'd come back for me.

01:23:06.904 --> 01:23:08.572
Every time, kiddo.

01:23:12.618 --> 01:23:14.494
Sly, are you okay?

01:23:14.745 --> 01:23:15.913
I feel funny.

01:23:17.664 --> 01:23:21.001
No. I think that's Sly.
Sly, are you okay?

01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:24.004
What?

01:23:24.463 --> 01:23:25.547
Helicopter.

01:23:25.839 --> 01:23:27.841
- The helicopter pad?
- Roof.

01:23:28.091 --> 01:23:29.343
The roof? He's on...?

01:23:29.635 --> 01:23:31.553
Oh, my God. Elena!

01:23:45.108 --> 01:23:46.693
Here, take him.

01:23:47.444 --> 01:23:48.445
All right, take him up.

01:24:06.839 --> 01:24:08.215
Take it up, you fool! Up!

01:24:08.465 --> 01:24:09.550
Up?

01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:11.301
Oh, my God!

01:24:27.776 --> 01:24:29.987
Dan, are you all right? Are you okay?

01:24:30.237 --> 01:24:31.405
Mommy!

01:24:32.322 --> 01:24:33.490
Mommy!

01:24:34.825 --> 01:24:36.243
Aunt Elena!

01:24:40.205 --> 01:24:41.123
Auntie Elena!

01:24:44.751 --> 01:24:45.836
Lower the chopper.

01:24:51.383 --> 01:24:53.844
Lower the helicopter immediately.

01:24:54.052 --> 01:24:55.304
Do it now.

01:24:55.596 --> 01:24:58.140
This is your last warning.

01:24:58.682 --> 01:25:00.809
Lower the chopper.

01:25:08.859 --> 01:25:11.069
Officer, arrest this woman.
She's insane!

01:25:11.278 --> 01:25:12.779
She's trying to harm the babies.

01:25:12.988 --> 01:25:16.074
Auntie Elena, you tell them
or I swear to God...

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:19.494
For heaven's sakes,
stop calling me that.

01:25:19.828 --> 01:25:21.538
I am not your aunt.

01:25:21.955 --> 01:25:23.040
You're not my aunt?

01:25:23.290 --> 01:25:25.918
Your mother adopted you
when you were 2!

01:25:26.418 --> 01:25:27.336
I was adopted?

01:25:27.878 --> 01:25:31.465
Do you actually think that you and I
come from the same gene pool?

01:25:31.673 --> 01:25:34.384
Thank you, God. Thank you. Thank you!

01:25:38.096 --> 01:25:41.308
I would have felt terrible
hitting my aunt like that.

01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:44.228
Officer, that's my son.

01:25:44.436 --> 01:25:46.980
- This is your child, ma'am?
- I know my son.

01:25:50.526 --> 01:25:52.152
Look at your daddy.

01:25:56.782 --> 01:25:58.158
Look at you.

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.166
Are you crossing over?

01:26:07.584 --> 01:26:08.836
I think maybe I am.

01:26:10.587 --> 01:26:12.881
Maybe it won't be so bad.

01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:15.717
There's just so much they don't know.

01:26:15.968 --> 01:26:17.302
You're right about that.

01:26:18.095 --> 01:26:19.930
But they try so hard.

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.557
You gotta love them.

01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:25.102
I'll see you on the other side.

01:26:27.062 --> 01:26:29.273
I feel kind of funny myself.

01:26:32.276 --> 01:26:33.777
See you.

01:27:11.565 --> 01:27:12.399
Honey!

01:27:13.859 --> 01:27:14.943
Honey!

01:27:15.485 --> 01:27:18.238
It was a giant baby and a dinosaur.

01:27:18.572 --> 01:27:20.949
- You're remembering.
- Something about Dickie.

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.327
Dickie and Lenny.
They were like a team.

01:27:23.577 --> 01:27:25.454
- Something like that.
- The twins!

01:27:25.704 --> 01:27:27.331
It was a secret lab.

01:27:27.581 --> 01:27:29.249
Liechtenstein. Where are the boys?

01:27:29.499 --> 01:27:31.460
- Everything's fine.
- It's true.

01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:34.004
Babies do talk.
Now the whole world knows.

01:27:34.254 --> 01:27:35.672
But only you understood them.

01:27:35.923 --> 01:27:38.008
Whit and Sly.
They can tell us everything.

01:27:38.217 --> 01:27:39.676
Guys.

01:27:41.553 --> 01:27:43.931
Hey, twins! We've got twins.

01:27:44.890 --> 01:27:47.601
Okay, guys, tell me the secrets of life.

01:27:47.976 --> 01:27:51.313
Come on, Sly, what's up?
What's going on out there?

01:27:51.563 --> 01:27:52.814
They've crossed over.

01:27:53.065 --> 01:27:54.942
What? You've crossed over?

01:27:56.151 --> 01:27:59.238
No secrets of life.
No universal knowledge.

01:27:59.696 --> 01:28:02.074
Wait. Carrie knows it.
Come here, Carrie.

01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:03.867
- Right.
- Come here.

01:28:05.202 --> 01:28:06.787
Come here, sweetie.

01:28:06.995 --> 01:28:08.872
Come on. Tell me everything.

01:28:09.122 --> 01:28:10.207
Come on.

01:28:11.667 --> 01:28:13.043
Come on, honey.

01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:15.921
Gee, another Kodak moment.

01:28:16.797 --> 01:28:17.798
I get it.

01:28:18.006 --> 01:28:20.634
You're not gonna
tell me a thing, are you?

01:28:21.426 --> 01:28:22.261
Nope.

01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:26.723
I think she's trying to tell you this
is the way things are supposed to be.

01:28:27.558 --> 01:28:29.184
No secrets of life.

01:28:29.685 --> 01:28:32.229
You want to see the real secret of life?

01:28:33.272 --> 01:28:34.773
Take a look.

01:30:51.827 --> 01:30:55.163
Okay, that's a wrap!
You're out of here, Sly.

01:30:55.706 --> 01:31:00.752
If they think I'm doing the sequel
for less than 20 mil, they're nuts.
