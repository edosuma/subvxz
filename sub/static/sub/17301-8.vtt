00:01.527 --> 00:05.596
Tonight, Richard and James
enjoy life under canvas.

00:05.596 --> 00:09.867
An Alfa Romeo
waving its arms around.

00:09.867 --> 00:13.951
And Darth Vader
in a Honda Civic TIE fighter R!

00:17.167 --> 00:22.327
Good evening. Back in the late '60s,
Nissan, or Datsun as they were then,

00:22.327 --> 00:27.097
decided to make a sports car.
This is it, the 240Z.

00:27.097 --> 00:31.867
It was a simple recipe. Three parts
E-type Jaguar, two parts Corvette,

00:31.867 --> 00:36.607
and a sprinkling of Japanese
reliability. Fabulous car.

00:36.607 --> 00:42.127
But they kept changing it, and each
time they did, they made it worse.

00:42.127 --> 00:45.807
There was the 260Z, which was plump,

00:45.807 --> 00:49.887
the 280Z, which was...John Prescott,

00:49.887 --> 00:55.607
and finally they ended up with
this enormous thing, the 300ZX.

00:55.607 --> 01:00.707
Marlon Brando, really.
AS BRANDO:. "The horror. The horror. "

01:00.707 --> 01:05.547
We've been joined by some people
from the Nissan Z Club, yes? Yes.

01:05.547 --> 01:08.607
Which is yours? The 280.

01:08.607 --> 01:13.624
What in the name of all that's holy
possessed you to buy that?

01:13.625 --> 01:20.105
I bought it 15 years ago,
and it looked good then.
It's beige with red seats!

01:20.105 --> 01:24.885
Are you from Birmingham? Yes, how
did you guess? That explains it all!

01:24.885 --> 01:30.695
Have you got one? Yes. And you've
got a beard. And you have a beard.

01:30.695 --> 01:34.045
That explains the appeal
of the Z car!

01:34.045 --> 01:39.365
Happily, however, Nissan has now
gone back to basics with the 350Z.

01:39.365 --> 01:44.105
I was so keen to try it out that
when it first arrived in Britain,

01:44.105 --> 01:47.450
I grabbed the keys
and went for a drive.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074

02:02.045 --> 02:08.305
Part of the reason Nissan's Z cars
became so fat and so heavy

02:08.305 --> 02:11.865
is that they were designed
mainly for Americans.

02:11.865 --> 02:17.314
And the ideal American car is, as
I'm sure you know, an enormous sofa.

02:22.095 --> 02:25.605
This one was designed
not only for Americans,

02:25.605 --> 02:31.345
but IN America, in California, home
of the palm-fringed, no smoking,

02:31.345 --> 02:36.965
six-lane boulevard. And that's
great, but we don't have that here.

02:36.965 --> 02:39.995
What we have is Sheffield.

02:39.995 --> 02:42.998
TRAIN HORN BLOWS

02:51.965 --> 02:56.435
So, how does the surfer boy
go down in the steel town?

02:56.435 --> 02:59.465
I think it looks a bit of a mess.

02:59.465 --> 03:05.335
But then it would, because it's
a Japanese car designed in America.

03:05.335 --> 03:09.615
The head of the whole project
was Ajay Panchal,

03:09.615 --> 03:12.635
who's an Indian from Leicester.

03:12.635 --> 03:15.175
And the engine? Well, that's French.

03:15.175 --> 03:21.185
Incongruously, it's the 3.5 litre
V6 from the Renault Vel Satis.

03:21.185 --> 03:23.735
We've had fusion food before,

03:23.735 --> 03:28.325
but it's the first time
I've encountered a fusion car.

03:28.325 --> 03:33.035
Think of it as being
a raw hamburger curry,

03:33.035 --> 03:38.302
served in a disinterested way
on a bed of garlicky jus.

03:42.935 --> 03:47.695
But you can't concentrate on
ingredients because of the stereo.

03:47.695 --> 03:54.295
You don't hear it so much as feel
it pulsating through an enormous
subwoofer in your back.

03:54.295 --> 04:00.155
If you like to cruise the streets
annoying people with drum 'n' bass,

04:00.155 --> 04:02.806
this is definitely the car for you.

04:04.795 --> 04:08.195
MUSIC BLASTS FROM STEREO

04:08.195 --> 04:13.395
I'm afraid, however, I'm more
interested in how a car goes.

04:13.395 --> 04:19.675
So I pointed its nose at the road
snaking out of Sheffield
and up onto the moors.

04:31.405 --> 04:37.135
It doesn't take long to work out
that this car has a few weak links.

04:37.135 --> 04:43.222
The biggest, weakest link of them
all, is the French bit, the engine.

04:45.345 --> 04:47.835
First of all, there's the noise,

04:47.835 --> 04:53.465
which is just a noise,
a sort of wearisome drone. Listen.

04:53.465 --> 04:57.975
ENGINE DRONES
It just gets on your nerves.

04:57.975 --> 05:00.665
Then there's the performance.

05:00.665 --> 05:03.655
It's said to do 0-60 in six seconds,

05:03.655 --> 05:08.585
and on to a top speed of 150,
and I'm sure it will.

05:08.585 --> 05:13.272
But... it never really feels
that fast, somehow.

05:16.435 --> 05:19.275
And when you look at the 350Z,

05:19.275 --> 05:23.345
you think it'll be light and agile
and sporty.

05:23.345 --> 05:30.005
I was expecting it to be
like a Nikon camera,
all delicate and clever.

05:30.005 --> 05:34.645
I thought it'd be like a Mazda MX5,
but with more power.

05:34.645 --> 05:39.025
And it just isn't.
Not even slightly.

05:41.505 --> 05:45.835
What it is is a tonne and a half
of ironmongering.

05:45.835 --> 05:48.365
It's a muscle car.

05:48.365 --> 05:52.525
Which should be good fun
on a road like this.

05:52.525 --> 05:56.125
I could go very berserk
at this point,

05:56.125 --> 06:00.635
but two things are stopping me.
The noise drives me mad.

06:00.635 --> 06:07.035
Secondly, it was on this very road
that the drummer with Def Leppard

06:07.035 --> 06:09.805
crashed his muscle car, a Corvette.

06:09.805 --> 06:12.325
As a result of that,

06:12.325 --> 06:17.325
he now has to drive
with a knob on his steering wheel.

06:17.325 --> 06:22.925
I also have to say that after a day
behind the wheel, I am knackered.

06:22.925 --> 06:26.605
A hard ride
and the effort of driving it

06:26.605 --> 06:31.365
makes it one of the most exhausting
cars I've ever come across.

06:31.365 --> 06:35.392
And I haven't finished
mauling it yet either.

06:36.705 --> 06:41.445
The look of the interior is fine.
I've got a big rev counter in front,

06:41.445 --> 06:45.505
three ancillary dials,
driving position's good.

06:45.505 --> 06:48.986
But what's not so good is this.

06:50.725 --> 06:53.535
FLAP RATTLES

06:58.405 --> 07:03.251
I've seen better build quality
on an allotment shed!

07:04.315 --> 07:07.005
Let's talk about practicality.

07:07.005 --> 07:11.045
There isn't any.
It has no back seats,

07:11.045 --> 07:15.305
just a bulkhead
to which the speakers are attached.

07:15.305 --> 07:20.505
And if we open the boot, we find
an enormous strengthening beam

07:20.505 --> 07:23.005
where your dog would normally go.

07:23.005 --> 07:28.765
All things considered, then,
the 350 is a C minus.

07:28.765 --> 07:31.768
Three out of ten. Could do better.

07:36.765 --> 07:41.525
No good? Not really. There's no
shortage of sports coupes coming up.

07:41.525 --> 07:44.965
The Mazda RX8 is nice. Yeah.
Good engine.

07:44.965 --> 07:49.205
There's the Audi TT,
and the Chrysler Crossfire.

07:49.205 --> 07:55.215
A Mercedes SLK with an American
body. It hasn't got its own feel.

07:55.215 --> 08:01.775
Nissan have now said the car
I drove is for a small
market in the south of France.

08:01.775 --> 08:06.525
The British ones, which are going
on sale in... September. Yeah.

08:06.525 --> 08:11.405
..will have better suspension,
bigger fuel tanks, better interiors,

08:11.405 --> 08:14.095
and will be completely different.

08:14.095 --> 08:20.815
Then why didn't they say, "There's
our new car. It won't be anything
like that, but there it is anyway? "

08:20.815 --> 08:24.865
Let's hope the British ones
are better.

08:24.865 --> 08:29.086
When we get a British one,
we'll give it to the Stig.

08:32.315 --> 08:34.375
This is Buttermere.

08:34.375 --> 08:36.914
The wettest place in Britain.

08:36.914 --> 08:39.554
And this is the campsite

08:39.554 --> 08:45.505
at the wettest place in Britain.
We're staying here. We're British.

08:51.845 --> 08:55.475
It's morning.
I'm going to look outside.

08:55.475 --> 08:59.145
If it's raining,
foreigners will laugh at us.

08:59.145 --> 09:02.755
If it's sunny,
even if it's just dry,

09:02.755 --> 09:06.475
they will never know
how good we feel.

09:10.275 --> 09:12.825
It's dry!

09:12.825 --> 09:15.035
BOTH: YEEEEEEEES!

09:15.035 --> 09:16.895
And that

09:16.895 --> 09:22.335
is one of the reasons we love these
cars. That crazy British optimism.

09:22.335 --> 09:24.555
You never know,

09:24.555 --> 09:30.095
any day, summer or winter, you may
get to drive it with the top down.

09:30.095 --> 09:33.545
The new VW Beetle.
We've waited years for it.

09:33.545 --> 09:37.455
And from some angles,
it does look a bit "classic".

09:37.455 --> 09:40.105
I mean, look at that roof,

09:40.105 --> 09:42.465
folded down there.

09:42.465 --> 09:47.073
Looks like someone's glued a Lilo
to the boot. Morning!

09:54.905 --> 09:59.815
Now, you can buy a Beetle Cabriolet
for 15,400 quid.

09:59.815 --> 10:05.475
But that's for the 1. 6. This
two-litre engine version is 17,500.

10:05.475 --> 10:09.825
And that's about 17,500...too much.

10:09.825 --> 10:13.555
It's cute now,
but it's a fashion statement

10:13.555 --> 10:15.845
that'll soon be out of fashion.

10:15.845 --> 10:19.935
It might've been saved
if it was good to drive. It's not.

10:19.935 --> 10:24.205
Its virtues are four good seats
and the fact it's German.

10:24.205 --> 10:28.195
It feels well put together.
It's really solid.

10:28.195 --> 10:33.765
I like the plastics. They're nice.
I like the body colour repeat panel.

10:33.765 --> 10:36.905
If it was in the shape
of a proper car...

10:36.905 --> 10:41.835
Here we are, driving into the rain.
In some ways, it's beneficial.

10:41.835 --> 10:44.485
People tell you this in the pub.

10:44.485 --> 10:49.825
Take the top off, drive in the rain,
you get above a certain speed

10:49.825 --> 10:52.685
and you don't get wet. It's rubbish.

10:52.685 --> 10:56.255
I'm soaked.
I'm not sure this was a smart idea.

10:56.255 --> 11:02.785
Why, do you think they'll
think we're a pair of screaming..?
Exactly. Yes.

11:02.845 --> 11:06.485
We have to put the roof up!
WIND HOWLS

11:06.485 --> 11:10.125
WAAAAH! Stop! What happened?
I've had enough!

11:10.125 --> 11:12.905
I just got a squall in my face!

11:12.905 --> 11:15.510
THEY LAUGH HYSTERICALLY

11:17.515 --> 11:21.125
What we want is a convertible
for sunny days

11:21.125 --> 11:24.205
and a hardtop for the other 364.

11:24.205 --> 11:27.985
Which is why we like
folding metal roofs.

11:27.985 --> 11:31.315
This is the smallest
and most ingenious yet.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.765
The Daihatsu Copen. It's SO clever,

11:33.765 --> 11:39.055
you might not notice that
this toy car costs almost Â£13,000.

11:39.055 --> 11:43.345
The ride's a bit hard,
but apart from that, it's good.

11:43.345 --> 11:48.185
Leather seats and a Momo steering
wheel. The engine does 8,500 revs,

11:48.185 --> 11:52.195
and there's a nice cold metal ball
on the gear stick.

11:52.195 --> 11:57.265
It's a sort of Sony Ferrari.
Same sort of thing, but smaller.

11:57.265 --> 12:02.545
660cc and a turbocharger.
It's brilliant!

12:02.545 --> 12:08.199
Ahhhhh, the new Audi A4,
the benchmark four-seater cabriolet.

12:09.745 --> 12:15.555
Normally, the A4 Cabriolet
is a fabulously discrete car.

12:15.555 --> 12:22.195
They've spoilt it
by painting it Cosmic Yellow.
Also known as Premium Beige.

12:22.195 --> 12:24.845
Not only colour lets this car down.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.515
Here we go. We're in the country.

12:27.515 --> 12:31.825
Gentle tweeting of birds.
Slight breeze.

12:31.825 --> 12:35.355
Let's have another country sound.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.985
ENGINE GROWLS
Ah, yes, Massey Ferguson.

12:38.985 --> 12:41.635
It's a diesel! Somebody decided,

12:41.635 --> 12:47.645
"Let's make a glamorous cabriolet
and give it a tractor's engine. "

12:47.645 --> 12:50.475
It IS a good diesel engine.

12:50.475 --> 12:53.705
In truth,
it's a fantastic diesel engine.

12:53.705 --> 12:56.995
And, actually, it's not THAT noisy.

12:56.995 --> 12:59.985
No, but when you're going slow,

12:59.985 --> 13:06.075
or you're just creeping through
town, pulling up outside a nice bar.

13:06.075 --> 13:11.515
Yeah. Dig-a-dig-a-dig-a-dig-a-dig!
People will ask where the taxi is!

13:11.515 --> 13:16.760
It's not right. A diesel cabriolet
is like a supermodel smoking a pipe.

13:19.635 --> 13:23.275
Audi should've stuck
with the formula,

13:23.275 --> 13:25.915
Iike Mercedes with their new CLK.

13:25.915 --> 13:28.625
This one, for example, has a big,

13:28.625 --> 13:32.475
extravagant and illogical
five-litre V8.

13:32.475 --> 13:35.015
By the Audi A4,

13:35.015 --> 13:40.840
this Mercedes CLK dwells in the
heartland of the posh German car.

13:42.785 --> 13:47.404
But there's a difference.
This one's wearing a HUGE Rolex!

13:49.575 --> 13:51.775
So you know it was REALLY expensive.

13:51.775 --> 13:55.875
Prices start at Â£30,000,
which is where the A4s stop.

13:55.875 --> 13:58.095
This one cost 58,000.

13:58.095 --> 14:03.015
Smaller Mercedes convertibles
have metal folding roofs -

14:03.015 --> 14:05.875
the SL and the SLK.

14:05.875 --> 14:11.225
This one's canvas. A four-seater
folding one wouldn't go in the boot.

14:11.225 --> 14:15.675
But what a canvas roof!
I mean, compared with our tent!

14:15.675 --> 14:21.915
280 components just in the roof
frame! And a lightning conductor.

14:21.915 --> 14:24.156
Jerry DOES care about us!

14:26.635 --> 14:31.215
A cabriolet can be big or small,
flash or a shrinking violet.

14:31.215 --> 14:34.275
Or maybe it can be all those things.

14:34.275 --> 14:38.564
Citroen reckons its new Pluriel
can be anything you want.

14:40.165 --> 14:44.955
This is the convertible stage.
That's the convertible. Yeah.

14:49.715 --> 14:51.635
Oh, no!

14:51.635 --> 14:54.490
Yeah, that's it!

14:55.295 --> 14:58.715
That's...Cabriolet.

14:58.715 --> 15:01.889
Ow! OW!

15:04.095 --> 15:10.239
Where are the flaps? They're not
under the floor? No. Are you sure?

15:13.575 --> 15:17.075
Oh, I see.
You have to... I'm doing it!

15:17.075 --> 15:18.963
Try that.

15:19.995 --> 15:22.585
Miles out!

15:22.585 --> 15:27.204
That's the Spider. Shut the door.
Do we look good with it?

15:30.365 --> 15:35.245
Being French, trim will drop off,
but what's underneath is tough.

15:35.245 --> 15:37.805
It costs from 12-13,500,

15:37.805 --> 15:41.685
and you can have
a 1.4 or a 1. 6 engine.

15:41.685 --> 15:47.555
But if you go for the 1.6, you
have to have the paddle gearshift.

15:47.555 --> 15:51.365
And it's hopeless.
I'm going to put it in second.

15:51.365 --> 15:56.025
That's OK. Now I'll wait
for third... And NOW it's changed.

15:56.025 --> 16:01.495
I'll select fourth... I've got it.
What? Have you something else on?

16:01.495 --> 16:03.825
And there's another problem.

16:03.825 --> 16:08.995
Ow, ow, ow... Ow. Ow.
We're going left. Ow!

16:08.995 --> 16:11.385
Citroen thinks people will drive

16:11.385 --> 16:18.085
with the roof rails in place.
I can see why. It's either in place
or in your crotch.

16:18.085 --> 16:21.995
So, is it going to rain?
Yep, almost certainly.

16:21.995 --> 16:26.011
Mmmmm. I brought the roof.
To be on the safe side.

16:28.165 --> 16:31.165
THUNDER CRACKS
So, er...

16:31.165 --> 16:34.945
judging by that,
you didn't go for the Pluriel.

16:34.945 --> 16:37.645
No. I really wanted to like that

16:37.645 --> 16:42.885
cos it IS cute, and it is clever
with its adaptation stuff,

16:42.885 --> 16:48.545
but the roof is SUCH a faff.
Great hire car. Yeah. On holiday?

16:48.545 --> 16:53.045
Then you can give it back.
That gearbox would drive you mad.

16:53.045 --> 16:59.105
It's quite safe, though. It's very
safe. NCAP crash-test, four stars.

16:59.105 --> 17:03.045
That was...
That was with the roof rails off.

17:03.045 --> 17:05.375
What worries me... Listen to this.

17:05.375 --> 17:09.464
HOLLOW BANGING
It's hollow! Yes. Nothing in it!

17:09.464 --> 17:13.185
Has it got an engine?
Yes, a 1.4 or a 1.6.

17:13.185 --> 17:15.464
So, we wouldn't have that. No.

17:15.464 --> 17:20.165
Let's run through the others.
Daihatsu Copen - good or bad?

17:20.165 --> 17:23.805
Good car.
He's mad on it! It's fantastic.

17:23.805 --> 17:28.970
It's small and silly. It just makes
the rest of the world massive.

17:29.045 --> 17:33.895
Like the incredible shrinking man
and the telephone gets bigger. No.

17:33.895 --> 17:37.325
I'm sure it happened,
but I don't remember.

17:37.325 --> 17:43.445
You drive around amongst massive
road signs and huge hatchbacks.
I hadn't noticed.

17:43.445 --> 17:47.535
Seemed all right. Beetle.
Would you buy one?

17:47.535 --> 17:49.043
Nope. No.

17:49.043 --> 17:55.573
You would? I would. You'd buy one?
Why would you buy one?
They're stylish.

17:55.573 --> 18:01.133
Cute - that's a car term. Hitler
designed it. But I like the car!

18:01.133 --> 18:04.003
You like something Hitler gave us.

18:04.003 --> 18:05.483
Great.

18:05.483 --> 18:09.213
What about the Audi,
in baby diarrhoea?

18:09.213 --> 18:12.963
Any other colour.
It's a fab four seater.

18:12.963 --> 18:17.803
It's the business. I've driven it.
It's a very good car.

18:17.803 --> 18:24.433
What about the Mercedes?
Would you buy one?
Not with that 500 V8 engine.

18:24.433 --> 18:27.423
Driving a convertible,

18:27.423 --> 18:33.803
either have a performance car,
or take the top off
and smell the cowpats.

18:33.803 --> 18:41.683
You may as well have a small engine.
So why not have the Audi? Yes.
Why take the Merc over the Audi?

18:41.683 --> 18:45.773
Which do you like the most?
Audi, Copen.

18:45.773 --> 18:51.633
Of all these, we like the Audi and
the Copen. I can't drive the Copen!

18:51.633 --> 18:56.293
You would look ridiculous.
I'd love to see it.

18:56.293 --> 19:02.203
I've got to see what this is like.
It's not a car, it's a shoe.

19:02.203 --> 19:07.937
Look at that, that's fantastic!
LAUGHTER

19:09.123 --> 19:15.783
The funny thing is, if I did over
500 miles in it, I'd have hair
like this guy. Look!

19:15.783 --> 19:18.934
Look at this!

19:20.143 --> 19:26.183
My guest tonight is very, very tall
and a global fashion icon.

19:26.183 --> 19:30.833
Like me, really.
Welcome supermodel Jodie Kidd!

19:30.833 --> 19:33.745
APPLAUSE

19:38.503 --> 19:40.663
Look!

19:40.663 --> 19:42.953
This...

19:42.953 --> 19:45.649
is what we've been waiting for.

19:47.783 --> 19:54.623
It's nice to have someone on
who's a proper size.
I don't have to look down!

19:54.623 --> 19:58.713
Do you have trouble getting in cars?
I do.

19:58.713 --> 20:02.463
But I'm quite nimble. I can fit in.

20:02.463 --> 20:06.193
I'm not that big.... big. You know.

20:06.193 --> 20:09.183
I'm tall.

20:09.183 --> 20:15.143
I have a rule - I say, "I can get
into anything I want to get into. "

20:15.143 --> 20:20.633
That helps. If it's a Ferrari...
I'll drive with my knees up here.

20:20.633 --> 20:25.993
Knees round your elbows. Actually,
for you, that might...yeah.

20:25.993 --> 20:31.833
Now. You were recently described
in the Birmingham Post as being,

20:31.833 --> 20:37.423
"a self-indulgent celebrity
setting a bad example. "

20:37.423 --> 20:40.193
Great. I'm happy.

20:40.193 --> 20:43.113
That's what I want to be.

20:43.113 --> 20:45.393
The Birmingham Post?!

20:45.393 --> 20:48.393
You went on the Gumball rally. Ah.

20:48.393 --> 20:53.793
It's a great idea! It's fantastic.
I've never been on one.

20:53.793 --> 21:01.153
It's a group of really cool people
who have nice cars,
going for a very long drive.

21:01.153 --> 21:05.193
Across America?
I've done east coast to west.

21:05.193 --> 21:08.753
This year, I did San Francisco
to Miami.

21:08.753 --> 21:11.193
It's like time trials?

21:11.193 --> 21:15.833
It's not. If you did that,
everyone would race.

21:15.833 --> 21:18.553
You have Ferraris, supercars.

21:18.553 --> 21:23.833
If you say that the quickest
will win, everyone will race.

21:23.833 --> 21:28.033
So how fast was it? I don't know.
I do.

21:28.033 --> 21:32.593
I don't know why I asked you.
I don't know.

21:32.593 --> 21:36.033
One guy took a Koenigsegg...
Oh God, you know!

21:36.033 --> 21:39.313
220mph! I thought it was 240.

21:39.313 --> 21:42.593
Was it? I stand corrected.

21:42.593 --> 21:45.953
How fast did you go? Don't know.

21:45.953 --> 21:51.633
I know this one, too.
I don't know. About 95?!

21:51.633 --> 21:55.683
In a Dodge Viper. I'm good.
It was 140.

21:55.683 --> 21:58.993
The truckers help out, don't they?

21:58.993 --> 22:04.873
They're great. They tell you
where the police are sitting.

22:04.873 --> 22:12.073
Why would you need to know that?
I don't know! It was warning
all the people behind me.

22:12.073 --> 22:14.913
OK. The Ferraris and all that.

22:14.913 --> 22:17.713
Um, so...

22:17.713 --> 22:21.393
They have Gumball in Europe now.

22:21.393 --> 22:25.193
It's in Europe next year.

22:25.193 --> 22:31.763
But I've just done... Iiterally
last week, I did a five-day rally.

22:31.763 --> 22:35.153
Driving? My car, a Maserati Spider.

22:35.153 --> 22:39.253
You drive a Maserati Spider?
I do, indeed.

22:39.253 --> 22:42.233
They're all around me. They're good.

22:42.233 --> 22:46.283
They're not. They are.
Um... no they're not.

22:46.283 --> 22:49.033
Have you driven one on a track?

22:49.033 --> 22:54.533
I have! How did it feel? Different
on the track to on the road.

22:54.533 --> 22:59.883
We have footage.... of Jodie having
a bit of a run with the Stig. Yes!

22:59.883 --> 23:04.963
Who'd like to see it? No.
ALL: Yes! Here we go. Beautiful!

23:04.963 --> 23:08.393
SCREECHING

23:08.393 --> 23:12.204
LAUGHTER

23:19.683 --> 23:23.953
That's insane! He's gone mental!

23:23.953 --> 23:26.547
JODIE LAUGHS

23:34.063 --> 23:36.643
APPLAUSE

23:36.643 --> 23:41.363
So where did the love of cars
come from?

23:41.363 --> 23:44.003
I don't know.

23:44.003 --> 23:49.703
I always rode horses my whole life,
and I feel that...

23:49.703 --> 23:54.123
when I got behind the wheel
of a fast car,

23:54.123 --> 23:58.953
it was that same adrenalin
you get riding a horse, playing polo.

23:58.953 --> 24:02.003
It's a great freedom.

24:02.003 --> 24:05.323
One thing I don't understand is...

24:05.323 --> 24:08.643
do they play on polo ponies?

24:08.643 --> 24:13.123
They can be horses.
Yours would be a shire.

24:13.123 --> 24:16.323
Mine's six legged! How tall is it?

24:16.323 --> 24:22.683
You probably won't understand this,
but it's about 15.3.
I have to have 17.

24:22.683 --> 24:28.563
How do you know? Hands. I know
everything about horses, not polo.

24:28.563 --> 24:31.683
I have three donkeys at home. Yes?

24:31.683 --> 24:37.163
Geoffrey, Eddie
and Kristin Scott Donkey. I do!

24:37.163 --> 24:41.453
I adore my donkeys. They're my life.
Fantastic.

24:41.453 --> 24:45.443
Noisy. It depends what you do
to them.

24:45.443 --> 24:49.893
You're chomping at the bit,
a horse expression,

24:49.893 --> 24:54.563
to see how you did
on your Suzuki Liana lap. Yeah.

24:54.563 --> 24:57.843
As you know, each week,

24:57.843 --> 25:03.701
we put a celebrity in a Suzuki
Liana, send them round the track.

25:03.701 --> 25:06.090
Jay Kay - 1 min 48.

25:06.090 --> 25:10.101
Richard Whiteley took two weeks,
six days.

25:10.101 --> 25:16.321
So where do you think you're going
to fit in there? I don't know.

25:16.321 --> 25:21.951
I'm competitive, I went round until
I got a good time. Practice laps.

25:21.951 --> 25:26.271
Tara Palmer-Tomkinson...
I've got to beat her.

25:26.271 --> 25:32.441
She got distracted -
she thought she saw a handsome
man... unlikely, here.

25:32.441 --> 25:36.711
It slowed her. You'll beat her?
I hope I beat Tara.

25:36.711 --> 25:40.391
Shall we see? This is Jodie's lap.

25:40.391 --> 25:43.292
Big wheel spin.

25:44.441 --> 25:47.671
Come on, Subaru, whatever you are.

25:47.671 --> 25:50.970
Subaru? Suzuki!

25:53.281 --> 25:58.581
That was my best one!
That's the best I've seen.

25:58.581 --> 26:00.503
BEEP!

26:03.351 --> 26:05.421
SHE CLICKS HER TEETH

26:07.061 --> 26:09.410
Ha ha ha!

26:09.410 --> 26:12.261
Very smooth...

26:12.261 --> 26:14.701
across the line!

26:14.701 --> 26:16.896
APPLAUSE

26:19.541 --> 26:22.044
Right.

26:23.621 --> 26:26.541
I love people's faces at this point!

26:26.541 --> 26:30.541
You're competitive. I'm nervous!

26:30.541 --> 26:33.981
You want to beat Tara. Yes. 1.54.

26:33.981 --> 26:36.781
Yes. You beat her. Good.

26:36.781 --> 26:40.581
Steve Coogan - 1.53. You beat him.

26:40.581 --> 26:43.701
Ooh! Beat Jamie Oliver at 1.50?

26:43.701 --> 26:46.981
I'm 1.50, so's Gordon Ramsay. Go on.

26:46.981 --> 26:50.861
You beat them. Wanna beat Jay Kay?
Yes.

26:50.861 --> 26:53.238
You did! No!

26:54.581 --> 26:57.402
APPLAUSE

27:11.301 --> 27:13.981
I should explain -

27:13.981 --> 27:20.381
we don't have points here,
but you were 0.3 of a second
faster than Jay Kay.

27:20.381 --> 27:24.181
I expect he'll be back next week!

27:24.181 --> 27:27.841
Ladies and gents, Jodie Kidd!

27:27.841 --> 27:30.423
Brilliant!

27:31.801 --> 27:34.622
I'll make it tidier.

27:39.681 --> 27:46.132
Have you ever wondered who'd be
faster in a Honda Civic?
Darth Vader or Ming the Merciless?

27:47.641 --> 27:53.011
We have. So, we set out to find
the fastest Master Of The Universe.

27:56.391 --> 27:59.001
So, here we are. One car. One track.

27:59.001 --> 28:04.330
And of course, there can be
only one, Master Of The Universe.

28:04.330 --> 28:10.191
You go straight up through the gears.
It'll be rapid as you reach the kink.

28:10.191 --> 28:14.641
Pass the tyres in third gear.
Hard on the breaks. Down to second.

28:14.641 --> 28:18.850
Follow the right-hand line,
the marked line, past the tyres.

28:18.850 --> 28:22.841
You're in third gear.
Hard on the breaks. Down to second.

28:22.841 --> 28:25.130
Turn in.

28:25.130 --> 28:28.190
Nice, exciting finish. Any questions?

28:30.730 --> 28:35.321
First up in the Civic Type R
is Darth Vader.

28:35.321 --> 28:38.890
Lord of the Sith.
Master of the dark side.

28:38.890 --> 28:41.881
Darth, no messing about, OK?

28:41.881 --> 28:44.588
TYRES SCREECH

28:52.791 --> 28:57.421
Go on, Darth. Use the force. Go...
Ooh, he's lifted.

29:02.410 --> 29:06.391
Well, he may be having family
problems at home,

29:06.391 --> 29:09.440
but he still put in a cracking lap.

29:10.681 --> 29:16.250
Next up, from Earth's twin planet,
Mondas, ruthless and emotionless,

29:16.250 --> 29:18.844
the Cyberman.

29:19.850 --> 29:22.490
Three, two, one...go!

29:22.490 --> 29:24.515
TYRES SCREECH

29:26.890 --> 29:32.749
Slight problem with his helmet,
but he's still on for a good lap.

29:34.450 --> 29:37.351
But, oh no! What's this?

29:37.351 --> 29:39.945
TYRES SCREECH

29:45.890 --> 29:49.751
Whatever happens now,
he knows his lap time is ruined.

29:49.751 --> 29:55.656
He'll complain to the stewards
about that, and who can blame him?

29:57.650 --> 30:01.490
Next, Ming the Merciless.
Emperor of Mongo,

30:01.490 --> 30:05.751
half-human, half-lizard.
His hobby is destroying planets...

30:05.751 --> 30:08.652
Go!..And tyres.

30:15.101 --> 30:18.719
That's looking pretty tasty.
He could do well.

30:24.410 --> 30:26.992
Yes, indeed. Ming's on a hot bot.

30:28.690 --> 30:32.990
But Darth and the Force
have another plan.

30:35.410 --> 30:37.913
TYRES SCREECH

30:50.101 --> 30:54.151
Now that is how you get
to rule galaxies.

30:54.151 --> 30:56.927
Never give up.

30:58.061 --> 31:00.655
What are you? Ming the Witless?

31:02.351 --> 31:05.761
Ah. A goody. Dr Who.

31:05.761 --> 31:09.970
Just one note as you clamber in.
No time travel, OK?

31:09.970 --> 31:14.077
It's smaller on the inside.
Disappointing for you.

31:21.050 --> 31:23.280
Keep to the middle lane.

31:25.301 --> 31:29.690
Obviously, you're not gonna
want him to do too well

31:29.690 --> 31:34.366
as you wanna do better than him cos
you'll be upset. Can you get upset?

31:37.450 --> 31:40.806
I think he's on for a good time.

31:42.610 --> 31:45.010
Exterminate!

31:46.161 --> 31:51.050
And now, from the planet Klinzhai,
it's the ill-tempered Klingon.

31:51.050 --> 31:54.821
OK, no cheating.

31:54.821 --> 31:57.381
TYRES SCREECH

32:00.541 --> 32:05.661
And immediately the Cornish pasty
faced villain resorts to cheating.

32:06.721 --> 32:09.246
I knew he'd do that! He's cloaked.

32:13.170 --> 32:17.121
So, a dastardly lap time
from the Klingon,

32:17.121 --> 32:21.967
but will it be enough to defeat
the most evil being in the Galaxy?

32:32.981 --> 32:37.261
Oh dear. He's not gonna like that.

32:37.261 --> 32:41.925
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate! Exterminate!

33:07.521 --> 33:13.781
It turns out then that Darleks
aren't just flummoxed by stairs.

33:13.781 --> 33:17.261
Completely beaten
by the Honda Civic.

33:17.261 --> 33:20.981
Our Darlek didn't even finish
he was so evil.

33:20.981 --> 33:25.181
In fifth place, Ming, you plonker!
You crashed!

33:25.181 --> 33:28.821
1 minute 49. You won't
be Master Of The Universe.

33:28.821 --> 33:33.521
In fourth, the Dr. 1 minute 43.
Very good time. Are you pleased?

33:33.521 --> 33:37.431
I don't know yet. But you're fourth.
That's not bad.

33:37.431 --> 33:41.521
It was noisy for an automatic.
Glad to see no time travel.

33:41.521 --> 33:46.661
It wasn't an automatic. Wasn't it?
That's why it was so noisy.

33:46.661 --> 33:53.181
Now I understand. Thought I'd
chip in. Thank you, Jeremy.
Incisive motoring journalism there.

33:53.181 --> 33:55.781
In third place, our Klingon,

33:55.781 --> 34:00.421
with 1 minute 42, which is pretty
good. Problems with the understeer.

34:00.421 --> 34:03.381
Are you happy with that?

34:03.381 --> 34:06.031
Hoch ni hoch na. Right. Jeremy,

34:06.031 --> 34:10.981
any ideas? Yeah. I've got Klingon
translations here from the internet.

34:10.981 --> 34:17.420
The understeer in that Type R's
diabolical, is what he said.
Still, well done.

34:17.420 --> 34:20.591
Second place, 1 minute 37,
Darth Vader.

34:20.591 --> 34:24.481
Very good effort. No.
Probably better not to shake it.

34:24.481 --> 34:29.541
That means then... Actually, can we
have some applause for Darth Vader?

34:29.541 --> 34:32.391
APPLAUSE

34:32.391 --> 34:38.081
Which means we have a winner.
It's the Cyberman.

34:38.081 --> 34:40.811
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

34:43.110 --> 34:45.221
Another...

34:45.221 --> 34:50.090
Another shoddy trophy there
from the Top Gear people.

34:50.090 --> 34:52.820
You must be thrilled with that?

34:55.710 --> 34:58.248
Really, really thrilled?

34:59.841 --> 35:04.290
It's like interviewing Kimi
Raikonnen this. Yeah. Keep going.

35:04.290 --> 35:07.259
You'll bring him out of himself.

35:10.060 --> 35:15.080
A while ago we asked people to send
us photos of botched custom jobs.

35:15.080 --> 35:20.320
The address given was,
"I'm a clot and I've ruined my car. "

35:20.320 --> 35:26.160
We didn't get too many responses
but we did have lots that said,

35:26.160 --> 35:29.920
"My neighbour is a clot
and he's ruined...

35:29.920 --> 35:32.960
LAUGHTER
.. his car. "

35:32.960 --> 35:35.890
Let's see them on screen. Oh!

35:35.890 --> 35:38.480
AUDIENCE GROAN

35:38.480 --> 35:42.650
What I find really interesting
about this is the crook lock!

35:42.650 --> 35:45.160
LAUGHTER

35:45.160 --> 35:48.970
Who the hell is going to steal it?
What would he say to the police?

35:48.970 --> 35:51.960
It's a Peugeot 205 S.

35:51.960 --> 35:57.030
Yes, with flames
growing out of the side!
LAUGHTER

35:57.030 --> 36:03.290
We've found your car, sir. You won't
believe what they've done to it!
LAUGHTER

36:03.290 --> 36:07.880
I've got one. It's a Citroen BX.
Sensible car. Look at that!

36:07.880 --> 36:10.450
LAUGHTER AND JEERING

36:10.450 --> 36:15.500
It was being fixed when he drove
off and took the ramp with him!

36:15.500 --> 36:17.030
LAUGHTER

36:17.030 --> 36:21.320
The BX has got a suspension
that goes up and down.

36:21.320 --> 36:25.890
I'm beached!
That is amazing.

36:25.890 --> 36:29.920
Listen. There was one
sent in and I just howled!

36:29.920 --> 36:36.820
The guy had magnetized his car and
driven through a branch of Halfords.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.630
Let's see it. Yes!

36:39.630 --> 36:41.520
LAUGHTER

36:41.520 --> 36:44.290
That is one of the most...

36:44.290 --> 36:47.230
What does he think it looks like?

36:47.230 --> 36:52.450
Another man magnetized his interior
and went through a scrap yard!

36:52.450 --> 36:55.290
Look at this one!

36:55.290 --> 36:58.630
Another 100 dials and he'll be fine!

36:58.630 --> 37:03.430
Now, spoilers. We know spoilers
are a very rich vein to explore,

37:03.430 --> 37:07.050
especially when
it comes to spoiling your car!

37:07.050 --> 37:09.890
This is awesome. It's on a Porsche.

37:09.890 --> 37:15.430
Look at that! That!
THAT is a spoiler. No, it isn't.

37:15.430 --> 37:18.970
No! No! No! This is tiny!
LAUGHTER

37:18.970 --> 37:24.370
It's a pathetic little thing.
Let's look at this one. YEAH!

37:24.370 --> 37:28.090
CHEERING AND LAUGHTER

37:28.090 --> 37:32.240
It's America! AMERICAN ACCENT:
Hey! I've got a bigger one!

37:32.240 --> 37:36.830
It's going to tip over.
It must. It's extraordinary!

37:36.830 --> 37:44.430
I have to say my absolute
favourite though is...
Iet's just see the roof.

37:44.430 --> 37:48.450
This is fair enough. The guy
is a fan of the Dukes Of Hazzard.

37:48.450 --> 37:53.050
Nothing wrong with that.
No. Let's have a look at the car.

37:53.050 --> 37:55.291
LAUGHTER

37:57.330 --> 38:01.850
That's a Vauxhall Cavalier,
isn't it? You can tell?

38:01.850 --> 38:05.290
You can't just
write Dodge Charger on the back!

38:05.290 --> 38:09.510
Next week I'm going
to turn it into a Lamborghini!

38:09.510 --> 38:13.590
Keep them coming. We can't promise
to put them on telly.

38:13.590 --> 38:18.510
They give us such a laugh that we
want to see them. They're brilliant!

38:18.510 --> 38:22.520
Recently, hot hatchbacks
have been in the doldrums,

38:22.520 --> 38:25.430
but have come back with a vengeance.

38:25.430 --> 38:29.080
Every other day
another comes along with more power

38:29.080 --> 38:34.256
and a new and exciting way of
getting that power on the road.

38:38.390 --> 38:43.000
A year ago we gasped when
Ford introduced the Ford Focus RS.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.870
It had 212bhp,

38:45.870 --> 38:50.140
which was harnessed by a
new type of front differential.

38:50.140 --> 38:54.130
Then Volkwsagen
came along with the Golf R32.

38:54.130 --> 39:01.850
This had 237bhp which was
kept in check with an ingenious
4-wheel drive system.

39:01.850 --> 39:05.800
Now we have the Alfa Romeo 147 GTA

39:05.800 --> 39:10.400
which has 250bhp.

39:10.400 --> 39:14.010
So does it have
a front differential?

39:14.010 --> 39:17.960
No. Does it have
a 4-wheel drive system?

39:17.960 --> 39:19.507
No.

39:22.150 --> 39:25.600
The result is,
shall we say, exciting...

39:25.600 --> 39:30.094
In the same way as
sharing your bath with a fan heater.

39:43.290 --> 39:48.660
In a straight line it doesn't just
beat the Ford and the Volkwsagen,

39:48.660 --> 39:52.300
it annihilates them.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.960
It really is a massively fast car.

39:58.960 --> 40:02.300
0-60 takes six seconds.

40:02.300 --> 40:06.820
It would be faster still
IF you could use all the power.

40:06.820 --> 40:11.650
Just imagine what the front wheels
are having to do in this car.

40:11.650 --> 40:15.140
They have to do the steering
and most of the braking.

40:15.140 --> 40:18.300
All the time
they are being attacked

40:18.300 --> 40:23.146
by 250 mad Italian,
over-excitable Il Palio horses.

40:27.300 --> 40:31.160
The traction control
is on virtually constantly

40:31.160 --> 40:35.620
trying desperately to keep
the power away from the wheels.

40:36.660 --> 40:40.164
De de de de de de - there we go.

40:41.820 --> 40:45.108
You may as well have a 1.3!

40:45.760 --> 40:50.265
The problem is that if
you turn the traction control off...

40:51.240 --> 40:54.573
.. all hell breaks loose!

40:56.860 --> 41:01.690
It wouldn't be so bad
if the chassis was any good.

41:01.690 --> 41:05.520
But it's really
very, very wobbly and loose.

41:05.520 --> 41:13.380
All the time you've got this heavy
V6 engine trying to drag you into
the nearest piece of undergrowth!

41:13.380 --> 41:16.310
It's a mess!

41:16.310 --> 41:20.310
This car is insane.

41:20.310 --> 41:24.041
But that's OK because
you'd have to be insane to buy one.

41:25.600 --> 41:29.530
I can guarantee
that it will go wrong in some way.

41:29.530 --> 41:33.680
I've had this half a day
and look at the wheel wobble!

41:33.680 --> 41:38.600
That will put you in the hands
of the Alfa Romeo dealer network,

41:38.600 --> 41:42.380
widely acknowledged
to be the worst in all of Britain.

41:42.380 --> 41:48.240
And there's more. Alfas depreciate
as fast as they accelerate.

41:48.240 --> 41:51.190
You pay Â£22,000 for this car now

41:51.190 --> 41:56.580
and in three years it will
be worth way less than half of that.

41:56.580 --> 42:00.040
If you have a modicum
of common sense,

42:00.040 --> 42:05.230
you'll avoid the 147 and buy one
of the other two. The Golf probably.

42:05.230 --> 42:09.240
It manages to be
nearly as fast as the Alpha,

42:09.240 --> 42:12.232
without being completely...

42:15.860 --> 42:21.170
Right then. Complete disaster. No,
fabulous car. Great in every way.

42:21.170 --> 42:26.050
You said it would lose all
it's value. That it'd fall apart.

42:26.050 --> 42:30.020
It'd crash into a field.
Those are normally bad things. Yep.

42:30.020 --> 42:33.230
There's another
way of looking at them

42:33.230 --> 42:36.780
and the place to start
is under the bonnet.

42:36.780 --> 42:39.470
It is not a 3.2 litre V6,

42:39.470 --> 42:43.860
but a heart with chrome ventricles
sticking out of it.

42:43.860 --> 42:48.190
If you go to the interior,
look at the body-hugging seats.

42:48.190 --> 42:52.986
Hand-stitched leather, dials
like a Ferrari, aluminium pedals...

42:52.986 --> 42:55.786
It's SUCH a nice place to be.

42:55.786 --> 43:02.626
It handles like a stallion
with half a hundred weight
of wasabi up its backside

43:02.626 --> 43:07.646
and I know it'll ruin you BUT if you
want to be sensible - get the bus.

43:07.646 --> 43:14.226
Can we nail this down?
If it's the real world and
your money, what would you choose?

43:14.226 --> 43:17.086
The Golf, the Focus or this?

43:17.086 --> 43:24.886
Not the Focus. It's the cheapest.
Yes and it's good on the track
but in the real world it's twitchy.

43:24.886 --> 43:27.826
I said I'd go for the Golf.

43:27.826 --> 43:33.726
Every fibre of me says, "Buy it" but
I'd veer off en route and buy this.

43:33.726 --> 43:39.786
I'd buy it too. It's crazy.
It's the one I'd get. It's mental!

43:39.786 --> 43:45.646
We're women, as he keeps reminding
us. You're a man. What's it to be?

43:45.646 --> 43:48.646
The Alfa. Good grief.

43:48.646 --> 43:54.726
There's something
we have to do cos we know nothing.
Avanti Stigissimo!

43:54.726 --> 43:59.486
Off the line and predictably
a huge amount of wheel spin!

43:59.486 --> 44:03.086
Two big questions.
Will the Alfa beat the RS Focus?

44:03.086 --> 44:06.635
Will it have any front tyres left
at the end of the lap?

44:08.086 --> 44:10.966
There we go.

44:10.966 --> 44:14.446
The Stig's gone
easy-listening opera.

44:14.446 --> 44:18.186
It's enough to bring a tear
to his helmet.

44:18.186 --> 44:21.386
He's keeping surprisingly tight.

44:21.386 --> 44:25.106
He's doing it
with no traction control.

44:25.106 --> 44:28.906
If you buy a 147 GTA
don't try it at home.

44:28.906 --> 44:34.626
The button that disengages traction
control will probably fall off.

44:34.626 --> 44:37.396
That's very fast.

44:37.396 --> 44:42.106
Flat out. If he tries this corner
he could end up in the studio.

44:42.106 --> 44:46.506
No. He's through it. He was four
seconds off at the halfway mark.

44:46.506 --> 44:49.346
He's across the line.

44:49.346 --> 44:54.826
I've got the time here.
It's one minute, 35.6,

44:54.826 --> 44:58.376
which puts it sort of there.

44:58.376 --> 45:02.706
You've got to ignore the ones
done in the wet.

45:02.706 --> 45:07.796
We're two seconds behind the Golf
and three seconds behind the Focus.

45:07.796 --> 45:10.506
Quite slow. Does it bother you?

45:10.506 --> 45:14.196
Not at all!
You'd still buy it? What about you?

45:14.196 --> 45:18.746
Couldn't care less.
Neither could I. I'd still have it.

45:18.746 --> 45:23.566
That's the extraordinary thing
about the world of cars.

45:23.566 --> 45:28.296
Bad cars can be brilliant
and there's your example.

45:28.296 --> 45:33.536
On that wildly illogical,
under-steering bombshell -
Goodnight!

45:33.536 --> 45:35.879
See you next week.
