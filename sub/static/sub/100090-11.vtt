WEBVTT

00:06.571 --> 00:10.140
- How you feeling?
- Like I was asleep for a year.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.142
- Do you want to come with me?

00:12.186 --> 00:14.101
Did you make a decision
or something?

00:14.144 --> 00:17.017
- Yes.
I'm having the baby.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.583
- The hell you doing
in Chicago, Jordan?

00:18.627 --> 00:20.368
Trey Woodson
got shot to death,

00:20.411 --> 00:22.065
and you got caught
on surveillance camera

00:22.109 --> 00:23.371
leaving his warehouse
with a gun in your hand.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.025
- I didn't shoot him.
- Was it Kristy?

00:25.068 --> 00:26.243
- She's my girl, bro.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.028
- Stay the hell away
from Kristy,

00:28.071 --> 00:30.769
and keep your
damn mouth shut.

00:30.813 --> 00:33.076
- Jordan, where you at?

00:33.120 --> 00:34.730
I need you
to call me back, bro.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.090
- Oh, hell, no.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.831
- I wish you would
get back in that car.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.311
I've been calling you
for four days, Jordan.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.269
- And decided to do what?
Track me?

00:52.313 --> 00:53.749
- I'm not trying to operate
like this,

00:53.792 --> 00:55.620
but I'm not gonna
let you avoid me.

00:55.664 --> 00:58.014
You can't cut me out.
- You put Kristy in jail.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.495
- And I should've thrown your
ass in jail right with her.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.236
You know how many felonies
you committed?

01:02.279 --> 01:04.107
How many crimes I had to bury?
- She's my family.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.587
- Your family?
Since when?

01:05.630 --> 01:07.284
I'm your family.
- No, you're not.

01:07.328 --> 01:08.894
I don't know you, all right?

01:11.636 --> 01:13.203
- Jordan, don't just
leave like that.

01:13.247 --> 01:16.293
- I said,
I don't know you, fam.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.487
- Hey.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.141
You know I like it when you
come down to my neighborhood.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.708
You sound a little off
on the phone.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.666
Everything...

01:42.972 --> 01:44.626
You went to the doctor?

01:48.412 --> 01:51.894
Alone?
- Yeah.

01:54.462 --> 01:58.683
- Sorry, I wanted to go
alone, I--sorry.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.772
- It's okay.

02:00.816 --> 02:03.210
I--can I see?

02:03.253 --> 02:05.429
- Yeah.

02:18.312 --> 02:24.144
- No, it's--it's just--
I don't know.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.623
You know everybody always says

02:25.667 --> 02:27.538
that these things are
just like fuzzy clouds,

02:27.582 --> 02:29.714
that you can't make
anything out, but...

02:32.108 --> 02:34.284
That's definitely our baby.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.766
- Yeah.

02:37.809 --> 02:39.246
I heard the heartbeat.

02:40.334 --> 02:43.206
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:43.250 --> 02:46.166
Like, I'm--I'm really
having a baby.

02:47.906 --> 02:51.171
Yeah.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.087
You know at some point
we're gonna have to talk

02:55.131 --> 02:56.741
about how this
is all gonna work.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.308
You know, what it's gonna mean
for us,

02:58.352 --> 03:00.267
what it'll look like.
- I know.

03:00.310 --> 03:03.313
- You know, and I just--
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:03.357 --> 03:04.836
When we were together,
you know,

03:04.880 --> 03:06.186
we always said that we would--

03:09.624 --> 03:10.929
Whoa.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.499
There.
- You see anything?

03:15.543 --> 03:18.241
- Yeah,
storefront's smashed out.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.943
Ladies, I'm gonna need you
to get the hell out of here.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.249
Right now, go.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.469
Run!

03:28.512 --> 03:30.210
- Please.
Please help!

03:30.253 --> 03:32.690
Please.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.431
Please help.

03:34.475 --> 03:35.998
- Hold on, buddy,
we'll be right there.

03:36.041 --> 03:39.697
Please help.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.569
Help me, please.
What the hell is happening?

03:41.612 --> 03:42.874
- Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

03:42.918 --> 03:45.921
5021, we need a ambo
to 47th and Wallace.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.618
I got one down.
- Clear.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.446
- What the hell is happening?
- All right.

03:49.490 --> 03:50.839
- What's happening?
- We'll have to move you.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.406
Kim?
- Yeah?

03:54.277 --> 03:56.148
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop,
stop, please, stop, stop, stop.

03:56.192 --> 03:57.585
Sir, all right,
you grab my arm.

03:57.628 --> 03:59.891
You grab my arm,
we're gonna do it together.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.199
- It's okay, it's okay,
all right.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.374
- Hold it together.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.028
Go, go, go, go, on three:
Break it.

04:06.071 --> 04:08.248
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- One, two, three.

04:11.207 --> 04:13.035
- Okay.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.906
- Let's go!

04:21.957 --> 04:23.698
- They rammed their damn car
in the windows.

04:23.741 --> 04:25.352
- I'm gonna go
secure the scene.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.179
- Drove right through them,
started shooting.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.703
- Sir.
- The windows, the doors--

04:28.746 --> 04:31.706
- Sir, did you see their faces?

04:31.749 --> 04:34.404
- They had masks,
but I could see skin.

04:34.448 --> 04:35.710
They were white.
- Okay.

04:35.753 --> 04:38.582
- Damn it,
I need to talk to them.

04:38.626 --> 04:40.367
I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.933
It's the adrenaline.
It's gonna wear off.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.326
Keep going.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.849
- They started shouting
some racial thing.

04:44.893 --> 04:47.504
"Go back home to New York,
Jew boy."

04:47.548 --> 04:49.289
I'm from Detroit, I'm Muslim.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.551
- Did they steal anything, sir?

04:50.594 --> 04:51.726
- I thought they were gonna
shoot me.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.205
- Sir.
- I'm not even open yet.

04:53.249 --> 04:54.729
- Did they take anything?
- There's nothing to steal.

04:54.772 --> 04:58.341
- You're gonna be okay, sir.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.690
- You're here fast.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.736
Did you hear it
over the citywide?

05:01.779 --> 05:03.346
- No, the superintendent.
Third one like this in a week.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.566
Crawford wants a unit
working on it.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.307
- All right, what do we got?

05:07.350 --> 05:10.484
- One injured,
lots of property damage.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.181
Definitely more
smash than grab.

05:12.224 --> 05:13.530
Owner said nothing was stolen.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.097
SUV drove into the building,

05:15.140 --> 05:17.447
offenders jumped out,
yelling racial slurs,

05:17.491 --> 05:18.883
shot up the place.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.581
- Hate crime?
- We gotta loop in

05:20.624 --> 05:22.626
the Civil Rights Unit
if it's a hate crime, right?

05:22.670 --> 05:23.671
- It's nothing till
we can prove it.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.499
Lick the scene clean.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.457
Shells, forensics, anything
these guys could've touched.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.546
Let's see if we can
lift any paint

05:29.590 --> 05:31.722
from where this SUV crashed.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.638
Messy means loud, so hopefully
the neighborhood was watching.

05:34.682 --> 05:37.032
Knock and talk the whole block.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.294
- Oh.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.817
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.602
- How'd you end up
catching this with Ruz?

05:41.645 --> 05:43.865
- I had a doctor's appointment,
and I'm pregnant.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.609
- You're pregnant?
- Yeah.

05:48.652 --> 05:51.089
- 'Cause of Adam?
- Oh, yeah.

05:53.135 --> 05:56.138
- Well, look who's here.
Welcome back, brother.

05:56.181 --> 05:57.835
- Yeah, I'm not allowed to
be full duty for another week.

05:57.879 --> 06:00.011
- You might as well live
vicariously through us.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.536
We can make a journal for you.
- Glad you're back, Jay.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.842
- Thanks, guys.
- Go ahead, Hailey.

06:04.886 --> 06:08.280
- Okay, three robberies
in seven days in Canaryville.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.674
But robbery is playing pretty
fast and loose with the word

06:10.718 --> 06:13.024
since nothing of large value
was actually stolen.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.113
The first two places hit
were still under construction,

06:15.157 --> 06:16.680
the third one wasn't open
for business yet,

06:16.724 --> 06:18.073
so there's no cash
in hand to steal.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.510
- All right, so it's
about damage, not profit.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.251
- Guys, we got nothing
on forensics.

06:22.294 --> 06:23.992
Offenders kept their masks on,
hands to themselves.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.602
- That fits with
the witness statements I got.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.212
"Two masked, gloved males."

06:27.256 --> 06:28.823
They also said
they saw shotguns

06:28.866 --> 06:30.564
and a black SUV
with the plates torn off.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.870
- All that is an exact match
with the other two,

06:32.914 --> 06:34.698
but this is the first time
that they're ramming windows,

06:34.742 --> 06:35.960
first time
they used hate speech.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.223
- It's about anger.
Not much planning.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.834
- All three were brand-new
establishments in the area.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.444
- I mean, it is Canaryville.

06:41.488 --> 06:42.793
They're notorious
for hating outsiders.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.882
- One might call it
a tight-knit community.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.232
- Yeah, if some still live
in the neighborhood.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.451
I ain't you.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.887
Grow old
where you grew up, baby.

06:49.931 --> 06:52.063
- All right, let's start
back from scratch.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.717
Work all three scenes again.

06:53.761 --> 06:56.807
Reopen case files,
re-interview the owners.

06:56.851 --> 06:59.549
Let's start finding
patterns here.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.769
- We'll take 3579
Sangamon Street.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.074
You take this one.
- Okay.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.685
You sure you don't want
the brewery?

07:04.728 --> 07:06.687
- Nope.
- Adam?

07:11.387 --> 07:12.736
I told Kev.

07:15.391 --> 07:16.436
- So we're tellin' people,
then?

07:16.479 --> 07:17.741
- Oh, no.
- No.

07:17.785 --> 07:18.873
- No.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.135
- When are we gonna
tell Voight?

07:21.441 --> 07:24.444
- We?
- You.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.271
I guess.
- I don't know.

07:26.315 --> 07:29.753
As soon as I tell him,
he's gonna put me on desk duty.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.842
He knows police protocol,
so most female cops,

07:31.886 --> 07:33.540
they wait a while to tell--
- Why?

07:33.583 --> 07:35.280
- So they're not out
of the action too long.

07:35.324 --> 07:36.543
So their jobs aren't--

07:36.586 --> 07:38.632
- Well, isn't that
kind of the point?

07:38.675 --> 07:41.591
- You know what?
I'm gonna figure it out myself.

07:41.635 --> 07:42.897
- No, listen, I'm not saying

07:42.940 --> 07:44.376
you gotta do anything
right this minute--

07:44.420 --> 07:45.639
- Yeah, I know,
I know, I just--

07:45.682 --> 07:48.468
I'm gonna figure
this one out myself, okay?

07:55.562 --> 07:59.043
- Okay, next place
we're going to is 4210 Lowe.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.436
Was hit three days ago.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.830
Supposed to sell artisan wine
and cheese.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.788
- This used to be
a family owned Italian joint.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.790
They had the worst chicken
you ever had,

08:06.834 --> 08:08.531
but old Jackie pretended
he didn't see us

08:08.575 --> 08:10.490
stealing beers
from the bar, so--

08:10.533 --> 08:12.535
- Units in the 9th District,
units in the citywide,

08:12.579 --> 08:16.626
armed robbery in progress.
4200 South Union 4and20 Diner.

08:16.670 --> 08:19.150
- They hitting another one?
- Caller states 2 masked males

08:19.194 --> 08:22.153
armed with shotguns.
Respond with caution.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.381
- 5021 Henry, call's bona fide.
Offenders may still be inside.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.470
- Copy, 5021.
Over.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.125
- Hey.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.996
I'm gonna take a peek.

08:41.477 --> 08:42.739
- You good?
- Yeah.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.654
- Chicago PD!

08:46.351 --> 08:47.875
Help.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.183
Clear.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.185
- Clear.

08:56.057 --> 08:58.102
- Hands up!
Get your hands up!

08:58.146 --> 08:59.103
Come on.
Get up.

09:01.715 --> 09:04.413
- We got one down.
- Police help.

09:04.456 --> 09:07.459
- Ma'am, just stay right there.
- Is anyone still inside?

09:07.503 --> 09:08.852
- Uh, they, uh, split up.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.375
One went out front,
one went out back.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.116
- Okay, we're good here, Ruz.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.509
- Get down!

09:15.380 --> 09:17.121
- Hailey!
- I'm good, you?

09:17.165 --> 09:18.340
- Yeah.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.124
- 5021 Henry, roll an ambo
to 4200 Union.

09:20.168 --> 09:22.779
Stay down, stay down.
- Okay.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.216
- Copy that, 5021.
Ambo in route.

09:25.260 --> 09:28.045
- 5021 Ida, offender fleeing
out the south exit

09:28.089 --> 09:30.047
armed with a shotgun.
I'm in pursuit.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.223
- Copy that.
You got eyes on him?

09:38.012 --> 09:40.971
- Help!
Nick!

09:41.015 --> 09:43.670
- Stop!

09:46.542 --> 09:48.936
- Chicago PD!

09:48.979 --> 09:50.241
I need both your hands
in the air now!

09:50.285 --> 09:51.721
- Nick, please!

09:51.765 --> 09:53.288
- Ma'am, ma'am,
please stay in the car.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.768
- Don't raise your gun.
Nick, he's a cop!

09:54.811 --> 09:56.421
- Stay down and stay
in the car, ma'am!

09:56.465 --> 09:58.641
- Nick, stop!
Don't shoot!

09:58.685 --> 10:00.469
- Put your gun
on the ground now!

10:00.512 --> 10:01.644
Drop the gun!
- Whoa!

10:01.688 --> 10:02.906
- Put your gun on the ground.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.604
You drop it, I'm police.
You drop that gun.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.867
- I'm not shooting,
I'm not shooting!

10:06.910 --> 10:08.259
Put it down!
Put it down, son of a bitch.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.957
Put your hands on the hood.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.394
- I know your plates.
You stay right there.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.224
Go, go!

10:19.227 --> 10:22.404
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.275
Advisor responding,

10:24.319 --> 10:26.669
offender's fleeing southbound
in a black SUV down the alley.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.236
I cannot go with him.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.677
- All right. Name?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.287
- You need it?

10:36.331 --> 10:37.680
- Yeah, for the witness
statement, yeah.

10:37.724 --> 10:41.336
- Right.
Nick Morella.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.555
I take it you work
out of the ninth district.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.427
- Grew up in it.
43rd and Normal.

10:45.470 --> 10:49.039
- Look, man, I know my last
name doesn't have the best rep,

10:49.083 --> 10:50.911
my brothers, cousins, me--

10:50.954 --> 10:53.000
but I did two years in Menard,
I cleaned up after.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.566
- Look, today all I care about

10:54.610 --> 10:57.004
is the guy that attempted
to jack your car.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.788
- I really wasn't trying
to hurt him bad.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.529
He went for my wife's door,
and he had a gun,

11:00.572 --> 11:01.791
my kid was in the back.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.274
- I would've done
the same thing.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.972
Seriously.
Did you get a good look at him?

11:09.016 --> 11:11.279
- His mask went up a bit.
Was just a kid.

11:11.322 --> 11:13.063
19, 20.
White.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.978
- How do you, uh,
how do you feel about

11:15.022 --> 11:17.502
getting together
with a sketch artist?

11:17.546 --> 11:18.939
- Nah, it's fine.
- Great.

11:18.982 --> 11:21.071
Great.
Uh, go check on your kid,

11:21.115 --> 11:23.726
I'll be back in a few.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.902
- So we're still running it
through the system,

11:25.946 --> 11:27.904
but you know, white, 19 to 21.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.079
- Lot of white guys
in Canaryville

11:29.123 --> 11:30.385
got one foot in crime.

11:30.428 --> 11:31.691
- Yeah, a lot
with two feet too.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.344
- Forensics is hoping

11:33.388 --> 11:35.259
blood samples from the street
fight aren't too contaminated.

11:35.303 --> 11:38.088
May get a match in CODIS,
but long shot.

11:38.132 --> 11:40.090
- So I pulled up as much
footage as I could

11:40.134 --> 11:41.875
from traffic cams
within a three mile radius

11:41.918 --> 11:44.399
of that diner, and all I got
is one shot of this SUV.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.531
- One shot?
How is that even possible?

11:46.575 --> 11:48.795
- Because whoever it is
knew what streets to avoid,

11:48.838 --> 11:50.666
and they kept blind
damn near the whole time.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.929
Now I did as much homework
as I could,

11:52.973 --> 11:54.757
but all we got
is this torn off sticker

11:54.801 --> 11:56.150
that we can't even
throw in the system.

11:56.193 --> 11:58.326
- No, no, no.
Shoot, you don't have to.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.502
I know this.
My dad's got one.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.243
It's from a locals only bar.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.288
Well, I--they lost
their liquor license.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.464
Too many vice calls, so club
is probably more accurate,

12:06.508 --> 12:09.337
but I definitely know it.
- All right, check it out.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.952
- I heard the good news, dawg.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.388
- Yeah, right.
I wanted to tell you--

12:17.432 --> 12:19.782
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, yeah.

12:19.826 --> 12:20.957
- You okay?

12:21.001 --> 12:23.351
- Yeah, I'm good.
Why?

12:23.394 --> 12:25.745
- 'Cause you don't seem
too excited, man.

12:25.788 --> 12:29.183
- No, I'm excited, I just--

12:29.226 --> 12:31.925
it's all kind of happening
a little fast, you know?

12:31.968 --> 12:34.057
- I understand that.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.494
So what's going on?
Y'all together, or what?

12:36.538 --> 12:38.235
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
nothing like that.

12:38.279 --> 12:42.283
We just hung out a few times
a couple months back,

12:42.326 --> 12:44.241
that sort of thing.
- Mm-hmm.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.156
- Bro, if we were together,
you'd be the first to know.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.810
- Well, I was the first
to know this.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.030
Thanks for telling me.

12:50.073 --> 12:53.424
- I didn't know I was allowed.
I didn't know--

12:53.468 --> 12:56.427
dude, she and I
are so out of sync.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.299
I mean, if I ask a question,
she gets annoyed,

12:58.342 --> 13:00.301
if I don't ask questions
she gets annoyed.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.433
It's like, I don't know
if I'm supposed to zig or zag.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.087
If I zig,
she's angry I didn't zag,

13:04.131 --> 13:05.697
if I zag,
she's angry I didn't zig.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.830
It's all very confusing.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.658
And I get
that she's the mother.

13:09.701 --> 13:13.270
You know, that's her baby.
I get that, you know?

13:13.314 --> 13:16.143
I don't know, I'm
trying to do the right thing.

13:16.186 --> 13:17.579
I clearly don't know what
that is,

13:17.622 --> 13:20.016
but I'm still the father,
or I wanna be.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.453
- Bro, you know
that fatherhood ain't no joke.

13:22.497 --> 13:25.065
Because your father
did it right.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.849
So just be there.

13:26.893 --> 13:30.897
No long distance,
no every other weekend.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.421
Just be in it,
and you'll be good.

13:40.036 --> 13:42.386
- Probably best I do
the talking in here, bro.

13:42.430 --> 13:44.867
- Copy that.

13:44.911 --> 13:45.868
After you.

13:49.306 --> 13:51.352
- Heya, Sul.
- I ain't got nothing for you.

13:51.395 --> 13:54.224
-  You don't even know
why I'm here yet.

13:54.268 --> 13:57.532
- Not unless you're looking
for your dad or a beer.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.926
Don't really matter,
answer's the same.

13:59.969 --> 14:02.058
- Sul, I don't really
wanna be here

14:02.102 --> 14:03.407
any more than you want me here,

14:03.451 --> 14:04.844
so just let me
ask the questions

14:04.887 --> 14:05.975
so I can get
the hell out, okay?

14:06.019 --> 14:07.847
- He just told you,
answer's the same.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.370
- Oh, we got a chorus, huh?

14:09.413 --> 14:11.938
- Just trying to not waste
taxpayer dollars.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.765
- Is that so?
- Yep.

14:13.809 --> 14:15.245
Take a look around,

14:15.289 --> 14:17.247
you think anything in here's
changed of late?

14:17.291 --> 14:20.903
- I think it smells worse.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.601
- But the women continue to be
the prettiest in town.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.125
How you doing, sugar?

14:25.168 --> 14:27.301
- Hi, darling.
Hey, how's Bobby doing?

14:27.344 --> 14:30.043
- Uh, you know, getting
older and more stubborn

14:30.086 --> 14:31.261
every day.
You know him.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.829
- Mm.
How I like 'em.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.396
- Know nothing, know nobody.

14:35.439 --> 14:38.703
- Listen, I'm looking
for a black SUV.

14:38.747 --> 14:41.793
It's got a torn 49 decal
on the back of it.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.273
- Never seen a black SUV.

14:43.317 --> 14:44.927
- You should probably
get out more.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.624
- Don't got nothing for you.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.191
- Sul, if you keep
playing it like this,

14:48.235 --> 14:49.932
I gotta pull
your footage, you know?

14:49.976 --> 14:51.803
Don't got no footage here.

14:51.847 --> 14:53.283
- That used to be true

14:53.327 --> 14:54.937
until your nephew
jacked your back door,

14:54.981 --> 14:56.852
ripped your safe out
the wall, stole $800

14:56.896 --> 14:59.115
and got high on blues with it.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.943
- Don't got no footage.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.640
- You do.

15:02.684 --> 15:06.253
That's your last violation
till you're shut down.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.995
You can read it,
but it doesn't change either.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.955
- I mean...

15:12.999 --> 15:14.870
- Thank you.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.705
Right there.

15:25.359 --> 15:28.318
- Uh, that's two months ago.

15:28.362 --> 15:31.365
See that plate.
Yep, here we go.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.280
Bingo.
Ben Wilcomb.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.977
White, 20 years old,

15:35.021 --> 15:36.761
two priors for assault
and attempted armed robbery

15:36.805 --> 15:39.634
when he was a minor.
Grew up in Canaryville, and...

15:39.677 --> 15:43.377
- Kid's never been outside
the borders of New City.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.509
Got kicked out
Tilden High at 16,

15:45.553 --> 15:48.948
In and out of juvie,
zero social media,

15:48.991 --> 15:51.820
but he's pure canary.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.649
Juvie records got him with his
address tattooed on him twice.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.172
- Okay, last known?

15:56.216 --> 15:58.000
- Uh, an apartment off of 42nd,

15:58.044 --> 15:59.871
but we're having
some problems with the SUV.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.265
- Right, being reported as
stolen to CPD three weeks ago.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.354
- Covering.
- Right.

16:04.398 --> 16:05.965
So I'm pretty sure those plates
are probably in a river by now.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.184
- All we have on him
is that car and the sketch.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.359
It's nowhere near enough.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.057
- We could bring him in,

16:11.100 --> 16:12.145
but he grew up in Canaryville
in juvie.

16:12.188 --> 16:13.624
He's not gonna crack.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.365
- Well, we need to make
a positive ID.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.063
Get a six pack
in front of Nick,

16:17.106 --> 16:19.369
and get coverts
on Ben's apartment.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.458
Let's keep eyes on this kid
until we can move.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.722
Let's put his ass
at these robberies.

16:24.766 --> 16:28.770
- So anyway, I was talking
to Kev about all this,

16:28.813 --> 16:31.120
just got me thinking,
I'd really like to talk.

16:31.164 --> 16:34.297
- Yeah, we will.
Sure.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.520
- Hey, Nick.
Officer Ruzek.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.652
Hey, uh--
- It's all right.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.959
Sorry, it's Friday night.
- No, no, no.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.787
I apologize for interrupting.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.659
Uh, do you have a few minutes
to talk?

16:48.703 --> 16:50.922
- Sure, but why don't we
go around back?

16:50.966 --> 16:52.663
- No problem.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.632
- Sorry,
I don't recognize anyone.

17:05.850 --> 17:08.897
- You sure?
- Yeah.

17:08.940 --> 17:12.379
- You can take a minute.
- No, sorry, guy's not here.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.252
- A man died.
We're talking murder, Nick.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.949
If you recognize somebody,
you gotta say something.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.517
- Can't magically recognize
someone that I don't see.

17:20.561 --> 17:23.259
- Oh, is that so?
- Yeah, that's so.

17:23.303 --> 17:24.869
I think you guys should go now.

17:24.913 --> 17:29.526
Nick, bro, how did we go from
"I'll do anything I can

17:29.570 --> 17:31.398
to help you guys," to whatever
it is you're doing right now?

17:31.441 --> 17:33.095
- You're from here.
- Yeah.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.271
- You know how this is.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.620
- I didn't know
the kid was local.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.274
All right,
I've got nothing to say.

17:38.318 --> 17:41.277
My loyalty is to my home,
my neighborhood.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.236
I'm not gonna help you.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.550
This is...

18:01.471 --> 18:03.430
- Okay, we build it up?

18:03.473 --> 18:04.953
- No, we got nothing
to build with, Sarge.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.563
Ben's phone was off during
the hits so we got no GPS,

18:06.607 --> 18:07.738
no calls or texts to link
to the robbery.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.653
- Accomplices are the same.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.220
Running Ben's circle
up against robbery priors--

18:11.264 --> 18:13.570
there's like eight dozen guys
it could be, they all fit.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.659
- All right, what about Nick?
Did he make the ID?

18:15.703 --> 18:18.009
- No, no.
He came up short.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.055
- Neighborhood whisper
a name in his ear?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.405
- Yeah, he said he couldn't
put his arm around a local kid.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.668
- Okay, fine, so we put the arm
on him instead.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.322
- What do you mean?

18:26.366 --> 18:27.454
- Well, you told me
Nick beat the offender

18:27.497 --> 18:29.020
with a glock, right?
- Yeah, but--

18:29.064 --> 18:31.675
- But he's on probation.
- The gun's not registered.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.025
- Even better.
- Boss.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.680
You wanna jam this guy up
for defending himself?

18:36.724 --> 18:38.465
Offender was trying
to jack his car,

18:38.508 --> 18:40.336
his kid was in the back seat.
He was doing the right thing.

18:40.380 --> 18:41.685
- Yeah, then, maybe, not now.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.948
I'm done doing
the Canaryville thing.

18:43.992 --> 18:46.168
Look, we got a dead
35-year-old

18:46.212 --> 18:48.736
who had a wife and two kids,
and we got nothing.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.955
- Right, right.
- We need something.

18:50.999 --> 18:54.742
Bring his ass in.
- You got it, boss.

18:54.785 --> 18:57.571
- I already told you.
I don't recognize him.

18:57.614 --> 19:00.487
It happened fast, I was all
juiced up on adrenaline--

19:00.530 --> 19:02.837
he tried to steal my car
so I hit him.

19:07.058 --> 19:10.671
- All right,
playing me for a fool...

19:10.714 --> 19:12.890
that's not your best move
right now, Nick.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.457
- They showed me
a photo lineup.

19:14.501 --> 19:15.980
I didn't see the guy,
simple as that.

19:16.024 --> 19:18.157
There's nothing that
you two can do about it.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.767
- Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.812
You're in possession of
a firearm, you're on probation.

19:21.856 --> 19:25.729
- Yup, and that's
a twofer, bro.

19:25.773 --> 19:28.776
With your résumé, you're
looking at least five years.

19:31.300 --> 19:34.173
- I can't ID him.

19:34.216 --> 19:37.524
I did nothing wrong.
I was protecting my family.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.353
- Family, huh?

19:40.396 --> 19:42.920
You ever stop to think about
the family of the dead guy?

19:42.964 --> 19:44.095
Huh?

19:46.141 --> 19:49.231
'Cause I'll tell you, they
ain't eating, they can't sleep.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.539
They're sitting at home
right now

19:52.582 --> 19:55.237
wondering how the hell they're
gonna get through this day.

19:55.281 --> 19:58.458
And the only thing that will
give them a little peace,

19:58.501 --> 20:00.547
is us catching the killer.

20:05.247 --> 20:09.425
But for us to do that,
you gotta ID the offender!

20:17.172 --> 20:19.043
- Otherwise, I don't know why
we're sitting here.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.567
We'll just charge you
and leave.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.830
- I'm not just gonna roll
on some neighborhood kid,

20:22.873 --> 20:25.093
just ruin his life--
ruin his family's life.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.053
- I'd be more worried more
about your family right now.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.055
- Find another way
to nail the prick.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.709
You don't need
to threaten my family.

20:32.753 --> 20:35.712
- Oh, you think
we're bluffing?

20:35.756 --> 20:38.933
That ain't a threat, Nick.

20:38.976 --> 20:42.632
I will put your ass in jail,
you understand?

20:42.676 --> 20:44.765
Yeah, I read your file, Nick.

20:46.984 --> 20:51.293
I know what you did.
Where you come from.

20:51.337 --> 20:54.470
You're doing better now.

20:54.514 --> 20:57.995
You got a wife, kid...

20:58.039 --> 20:59.997
I mean, that's all
that really matters, right?

21:00.041 --> 21:02.826
Family?

21:02.870 --> 21:05.699
I mean, there's nothing
more important than that.

21:05.742 --> 21:09.703
I'm telling you,
once it's fractured...

21:09.746 --> 21:13.620
I mean, you jeopardize
its safety, stability...

21:16.710 --> 21:19.669
You can never get it all back.

21:30.245 --> 21:31.768
- Show me the photos.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.607
That's him.
His name's Ben Wilcomb.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.046
I know his old man, Marty.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.312
Yeah, he's a good man.

21:57.707 --> 21:59.230
- All right,
two tact guys out front

21:59.274 --> 22:02.495
say the exit's been quiet.
Ben's still inside.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.542
Got an anchor out back.
Positions?

22:06.586 --> 22:08.588
- Holding down the lobby floor.

22:08.631 --> 22:12.287
I've got eyes
on north and south exits.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.028
- Copy you.
We're on the second floor.

22:14.071 --> 22:16.683
Approaching Ben's apartment.
- Copy you.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.870
Back inside. Back up.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.835
We're ready to crash.

22:38.879 --> 22:41.229
- All right, copy that.

22:41.272 --> 22:42.361
- Chicago PD!

22:46.016 --> 22:47.235
- Move.

22:53.067 --> 22:55.852
- The apartment is clear.
We do not have the offender.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.898
- It's quiet in back.
Lot's clear.

23:04.339 --> 23:05.775
- Got eyes,
the offender's running

23:05.819 --> 23:08.299
towards the basement.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.693
- Copy you, we'll cut him off
from the back.

23:15.002 --> 23:17.308
- Move, get, get.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

23:36.806 --> 23:39.505
I'm in the basement corridors.
I've lost eyes on the offender.

23:39.548 --> 23:41.071
- Oh!

23:53.257 --> 23:54.650
Drop your weapon!

23:54.694 --> 23:57.000
Ben, drop your weapon, now.

23:57.044 --> 23:58.741
Ben drop your weapon--
- Stop!

23:58.785 --> 24:01.657
Don't come any closer!
- Okay, okay, okay.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.485
Come on, man,
I don't want to shoot you.

24:03.529 --> 24:06.009
Look, this shouldn't be
the way it ends for you.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.794
That guy that died, right?

24:07.837 --> 24:09.491
That was a mistake,
I know that.

24:09.535 --> 24:12.015
Come down to the station and
tell us your side of the story.

24:12.059 --> 24:14.409
Give us your partner's name.
That will help you out.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.280
- You don't mean that.
- I do mean that, man.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.195
I mean it.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.197
You wanna end your days
in a dingy basement?

24:20.241 --> 24:22.504
Come on, put the gun down.
- Don't come any closer!

24:22.548 --> 24:23.853
- Okay, okay.

24:23.897 --> 24:27.030
Look, I'm gonna show you
something, okay?

24:27.074 --> 24:28.554
I'm gonna show you something.
I'm moving real slow.

24:28.597 --> 24:31.382
I'm just gonna talk
to my friends.

24:31.426 --> 24:34.298
I'm with Ben.
We're talking things out.

24:34.342 --> 24:36.866
No need to approach,
I've got things under control.

24:36.910 --> 24:40.043
Repeat, do not approach,
I've got it under control.

24:40.087 --> 24:42.872
Did you hear that, Ben?
I trust you.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.657
Okay, now put the gun down.

24:44.700 --> 24:49.052
- Stop!
- Okay, okay.

24:49.096 --> 24:50.314
- Chicago PD, you drop
the weapon, right now!

24:50.358 --> 24:51.490
- No, no, no, no!

24:51.533 --> 24:52.752
Adam, Adam--listen, Ben.
- You lied to me!

24:52.795 --> 24:54.231
- No, no, no, Ben,
put the gun down, all right?

24:54.275 --> 24:55.842
- I'm telling you,
drop that weapon right now,

24:55.885 --> 24:57.626
or I will shoot.
- We're good, Adam, we're good.

24:57.670 --> 25:00.324
Come on, Ben, put the gun down!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.895
- 5021 Ida, roll an ambo to
Garden Grove apartment complex

25:05.939 --> 25:07.418
on Union Street.

25:07.462 --> 25:09.246
Shots fired by the police.
Offender down.

25:09.290 --> 25:12.772
- Copy that, 5021.
I have the ambo en route.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.785
- I announced my office
several times,

25:25.828 --> 25:27.351
told him to drop his weapon,
he pointed his gun at me,

25:27.395 --> 25:28.483
I feared for my life,
for Officer Burgess' life.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.919
I fired off two rounds.

25:29.963 --> 25:31.355
- So you didn't sustain
any injuries?

25:31.399 --> 25:33.270
- No, ma'am.
- Okay.

25:33.314 --> 25:34.533
You still gotta piss and blow

25:34.576 --> 25:35.838
and take more pictures
back at the Area.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.753
I'll meet you there.
- Thank you, ma'am.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.325
Thanks.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.414
How'd it go?

25:46.457 --> 25:47.937
- Good, I think.

25:47.981 --> 25:49.852
It was a good shoot.
Pretty black and white.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.550
- Adam, I told you
to stay back.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.377
I had it under control.
- Kim, I was--

25:53.421 --> 25:55.075
- I gave you an order
over the DC.

25:55.118 --> 25:57.599
He could have shot you.
- He could have shot you too.

25:57.643 --> 25:58.948
- But that's not the point.
- That is the point.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.820
He had a gun on you.
I came in to back you up.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.343
- No, you came in
'cause I'm pregnant.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.388
Adam, I'm a cop.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.565
If I tell you to stay back,
I mean stay back.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.479
- I heard an altercation
over the radio.

26:08.523 --> 26:10.394
I heard him tuning you up.
What did you want me to do?

26:10.438 --> 26:11.657
You want me to leave,

26:11.700 --> 26:13.136
grab a coffee,
hope it all works out for you?

26:13.180 --> 26:14.529
- Oh, God, you don't get it.
- No, no, no, I get it.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.097
Hold on.
I get it.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.272
I totally get it.

26:18.315 --> 26:20.274
I just don't like
what I'm getting.

26:21.884 --> 26:24.060
You wanna tiptoe around this?
Fine.

26:24.104 --> 26:26.933
But things are different now.
You're pregnant with my kid.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.761
My kid.

26:28.804 --> 26:32.068
And so when I heard him working
you, I did what I had to do

26:32.112 --> 26:33.896
to make sure that
the both of you were okay,

26:33.940 --> 26:37.117
and if that pisses you off,
I don't really care.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.728
Goddamn, all I've been doing
is trying to help you.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.904
That's what I've been doing
since we found out,

26:41.948 --> 26:43.819
trying to help.
- Adam, I don't want your help.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.345
I know that you're the father,

26:48.389 --> 26:50.739
but I'm the one
having the baby, okay?

26:50.783 --> 26:52.262
I'm the one who has to change
her whole life,

26:52.306 --> 26:53.655
I have to put my career
on hold,

26:53.699 --> 26:55.222
and I have to hope and pray

26:55.265 --> 26:56.658
that it's still there
when I get back.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.139
Do you think
that's easy and fun?

26:59.182 --> 27:01.707
This may not be what you wanna
hear, but we're not together.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.491
So this isn't gonna
fall on us the same.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.841
I get to do this part--
this pregnancy part--

27:05.885 --> 27:07.669
my way, on my terms.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.366
That's it.

27:25.078 --> 27:26.557
- For what it's worth,

27:26.601 --> 27:28.429
black, beaten-up SUVs,
parked underground,

27:28.472 --> 27:30.692
tanks of gas
inside and suitcases.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.215
- He was definitely about
to bounce out of town.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.739
Glove up.
- Oh, thanks.

27:33.782 --> 27:35.828
- Other than this,
nothing too interesting.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.960
Unless you consider
a half-eaten salami sandwich

27:38.004 --> 27:40.006
with yellow mustard and pickles
interesting.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.660
- Mmm.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.662
Well, I think this
is pretty interesting.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.229
- Okay, let's get
all this over to OCD,

27:46.273 --> 27:48.144
and meet Sarge at the district.

27:48.188 --> 27:49.668
- Atwater, talk to me.

27:51.321 --> 27:53.802
Mm-hmm.
Are you sure?

27:53.846 --> 27:56.370
Okay, good looking out.
I'm on my way.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.823
- Slow down, man.
- You gotta be kidding me.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.651
- So you don't return
text messages?

28:16.695 --> 28:18.131
You cut your phone off?
That's what we doin' now?

28:18.174 --> 28:19.523
- Leave me alone, Kev.

28:19.567 --> 28:20.742
I'm not gonna talk
to you right now.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.396
- Huh? Why's that?
- Why's that?

28:22.439 --> 28:24.137
Really, bro?
You lied to her.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.487
Come on, man, she wasn't trying
to hurt nobody, bro,

28:26.530 --> 28:28.184
and I was trying to help her.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.577
- She killed a guy.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.624
You can't fix that.
You don't back that up.

28:33.668 --> 28:35.583
- You play her, you play me.

28:35.626 --> 28:38.020
You make me look like
a little bitch, all right?

28:38.064 --> 28:39.500
I love her.

28:39.543 --> 28:40.893
I love her,
and I got nothin' no more!

28:40.936 --> 28:42.546
- You got nothin'?
Come on, Jordan,

28:42.590 --> 28:46.289
you got me, you got family,
you got so much.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.682
- Don't talk to me, bruh.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.205
- Don't walk away
from me, Jordan!

28:51.773 --> 28:55.821
- Listen to me.
I don't want you.

28:55.864 --> 28:59.781
Okay?
Listen, stop coming.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.522
I'm not telling you no more.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.659
- I'm all you got, Jordan!

29:08.703 --> 29:11.053
Believe it or not, I'm it!

29:15.971 --> 29:18.060
- Shells recovered
from the brewery and diner

29:18.104 --> 29:20.628
are a match to the shotgun
we found in Ben's apartment.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.282
- So it confirms
what we already know:

29:22.325 --> 29:24.893
Ben's one of the offenders.
Who the hell is the other guy?

29:24.937 --> 29:27.026
- Hey, Sarge,
I just ran Ben's burners.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.071
There's a lot of messages
on there

29:29.115 --> 29:31.421
from an unregistered number
discussing the robberies first.

29:31.465 --> 29:32.901
The sender tells him
to lay low and hide,

29:32.945 --> 29:34.468
then he tells him to run.
I think we got there

29:34.511 --> 29:36.078
as he was trying to.
- Yeah.

29:36.122 --> 29:37.688
- That number's also a burner
phone that's been shut off.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.647
- You run the IMEIN?
- So I did.

29:39.690 --> 29:40.822
Uh, the phone was bought
at a corner store

29:40.866 --> 29:42.302
in Back of the Yards.

29:42.345 --> 29:43.433
Same place Ben bought his
burners.

29:43.477 --> 29:44.695
Upton's checking it out.
- Uh-huh.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.741
- Okay, owner remembers faces
real well.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.395
Said he know Ben Wilcomb,

29:48.438 --> 29:50.092
comes in all the time
to buy beer and cigarettes,

29:50.136 --> 29:51.615
and he came in last month
to buy a burner phone.

29:51.659 --> 29:52.834
- And the accomplice?

29:52.878 --> 29:54.880
- He said his father,
Martin Wilcomb,

29:54.923 --> 29:56.577
also came in to buy a burner
phone around the same time.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.535
- Guy goes to the 49.

29:58.579 --> 30:00.363
Atwater and I saw him
when we were there.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.670
Martin Wilcomb, 52 years old,

30:02.713 --> 30:06.108
a few misdemeanors
from when he was younger.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.849
Looks like, uh--

30:07.893 --> 30:10.112
ah, he owns two liquor stores
and a diner in Canaryville.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.723
- This says he filed
for bankruptcy two months ago.

30:12.767 --> 30:15.291
He named his LLC
"Canaryville Hospitality."

30:15.335 --> 30:16.640
- Huh.
- Okay, that fits.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.077
Marty's a believer
in the neighborhood.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.035
That neighborhood.
And he blames the demise

30:20.079 --> 30:21.950
on all the new businesses
coming into town.

30:21.994 --> 30:23.865
Him and the kid, they start
robbing and vandalizing

30:23.909 --> 30:25.171
these places to push 'em out.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.650
- IMEIs are a match,

30:26.694 --> 30:28.478
owner has meticulous records
and footage.

30:28.522 --> 30:30.176
- All right,
so let's go grab him up.

30:32.395 --> 30:35.050
- Levels.
- Halt.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.967
Move.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.232
- We're good.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.061
You see the blood?
- Yeah.

30:46.105 --> 30:47.584
- All right, you go left,
I go right.

30:47.628 --> 30:50.544
- On my count.
One, two, three, go.

30:50.587 --> 30:51.937
- Body!
- Clear.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.547
- Yeah, he's still breathing.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.810
- 5021, roll an ambo
to 3711 Wallace.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.551
- Sir, can you hear me?

30:57.594 --> 30:59.553
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.598
- Nick.

31:01.642 --> 31:02.904
Nick--
- Hey.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.732
- Nick, it's Officer
Adam Ruzek.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.168
Do you recognize me?
What are you doing here, man?

31:06.212 --> 31:09.389
What happened?
- I came to talk to Marty.

31:09.432 --> 31:13.393
Apologize, tell him the cops
are looking for his kid,

31:13.436 --> 31:17.527
and he--
he grabbed a bat and he--

31:27.798 --> 31:29.800
- Hey, Adam.
- What?

31:29.844 --> 31:31.324
- You get anything
from Halstead?

31:31.367 --> 31:33.108
- I'll call.
Can you believe this guy?

31:33.152 --> 31:34.762
Tells the father of the kid
he just ratted out,

31:34.805 --> 31:36.459
that he just
ratted him out.

31:36.503 --> 31:39.071
- Yeah, well, not a smart move,
all things considered.

31:39.114 --> 31:41.073
The fact that Nick was in there

31:41.116 --> 31:42.552
purging his Canaryville
heart out,

31:42.596 --> 31:44.728
means that Marty
knows we're looking at him,

31:44.772 --> 31:47.296
and he's got a jump.
We gotta move fast.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.516
This guy can't be far.
Let's patrol the neighborhood.

31:49.559 --> 31:52.214
- Hey, Jay, it's Adam.
Where we at?

31:52.258 --> 31:53.824
- Ruz, I got a bolo out
on his car

31:53.868 --> 31:55.565
and investigative alerts out

31:55.609 --> 31:57.089
at all the airports, train
stations, and bus stations.

31:57.132 --> 31:58.829
- What about his cell phone?

31:58.873 --> 32:00.527
- So I ran his registered
phone and his burner phone.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.833
Both are shut off, no signal.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.226
- Wait, his SUV
is damn near new.

32:04.270 --> 32:05.836
We should be able
to track him down

32:05.880 --> 32:07.751
with the navigation system.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:07.795 --> 32:09.144
All right, I'm gonna start
writing you guys up a warrant.

32:09.188 --> 32:10.276
You hear that?
- All right.

32:10.319 --> 32:11.668
Call me when you
got a location.

32:11.712 --> 32:12.669
- All right.

32:20.764 --> 32:23.419
- Boss, that's his car.

32:23.463 --> 32:27.162
- Mm, call it.
- We got eyes on his vehicle.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.382
Southeast corner of the park.

32:29.425 --> 32:30.992
- In the back
in the bleachers over there.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.516
- Copy that.
- Yeah, that's him.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.432
- We got Marty on the bleachers
on the west end.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.304
I want you to clear the park.

32:38.347 --> 32:41.481
Adam and I are approaching
from the north side.

32:41.524 --> 32:42.917
- Kids, kids,
I'm with Chicago PD, all right?

32:42.961 --> 32:44.179
Everything's gonna be okay,

32:44.223 --> 32:45.224
but I want you to
find your parents.

32:45.267 --> 32:46.268
Hey, buddy, go to your parents.

32:46.312 --> 32:47.835
- Come on, come on, let's move.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.840
- These kids.
Hey, guys.

32:52.883 --> 32:54.668
Move on, fast, will you?

32:54.711 --> 32:56.148
- Gun, gun, gun,
gun, gun, gun, gun.

32:56.191 --> 32:58.237
- Move, move, move.
Go!

32:58.280 --> 33:01.066
Now!
Hey, Marty.

33:02.589 --> 33:03.633
Marty, listen to me,

33:03.677 --> 33:05.244
I'm Sergeant Hank Voight,
Chicago PD.

33:05.287 --> 33:07.594
I need you to
put that gun down.

33:07.637 --> 33:10.466
Marty, look at me.

33:10.510 --> 33:13.861
Put the gun down.
You gotta drop the weapon.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.602
Come on, Marty.

33:15.645 --> 33:19.040
- I used to play with my son
here when he was little.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.737
Always made me happy.

33:20.781 --> 33:23.175
- It's a great place.

33:23.218 --> 33:24.872
There's a lot of families here,

33:24.915 --> 33:27.266
that's why I need you
to put the gun down, Marty.

33:27.309 --> 33:29.703
- I'm supposed to meet
Benny here.

33:29.746 --> 33:32.401
I was gonna get him out.

33:32.445 --> 33:34.099
You arrest him already?

33:34.142 --> 33:36.144
- Marty,
we can talk about Benny later.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.928
Right now, we gotta deal
with the gun in your hand.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.452
Okay?
Let's do that first.

33:39.495 --> 33:42.150
- We didn't mean
to hurt anybody.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.065
We were just protecting
what was ours,

33:44.109 --> 33:46.502
what we worked to build.
- I get it.

33:46.546 --> 33:48.374
I mean, that's what guys
like you and me do.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.550
We protect our families,
but Marty...

33:52.117 --> 33:54.119
A man died,
and you gotta answer for that.

33:55.946 --> 33:57.905
- Yeah.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.559
I just, um...

34:01.822 --> 34:03.998
I had a life.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.914
I looked up one day,
and it was gone.

34:06.957 --> 34:09.917
I thought if I could scare them
away, things would go back.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.705
- Whoa, whoa, Marty, whoa.

34:15.749 --> 34:17.968
- I wanna know where Benny is.
- Okay.

34:18.012 --> 34:19.144
- Put that gun down,
we'll tell you.

34:19.187 --> 34:20.623
- Yeah.
- He in jail?

34:25.324 --> 34:28.240
He's dead, isn't he?

34:28.283 --> 34:30.329
That's why you won't tell me
where he is?

34:30.372 --> 34:32.113
- Marty, give me the gun.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.115
- How'd he die?

34:34.159 --> 34:36.074
You guys shoot him?

34:37.205 --> 34:40.121
- Marty, give me the gun.
Relax.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.905
We can work it--
whoa, Marty!

34:41.949 --> 34:43.559
Do not!
Whoa, easy.

34:43.603 --> 34:45.344
Easy.

34:45.387 --> 34:48.216
We had a hell of a run.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.262
Good business, good family.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.138
Now it's over,
and it's all my fault.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.966
- It's not over.
- I, um...

34:59.009 --> 35:00.315
- Take it easy.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.797
I screwed up.
- Yeah, Marty.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.451
Yeah, you screwed up,
you made a mistake.

35:05.494 --> 35:07.888
It happens all the time.

35:07.931 --> 35:10.151
We can work with you.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.153
But put the gun down.

35:18.420 --> 35:21.249
You should've let me die.

35:21.293 --> 35:23.947
You should've let me
kill myself.

35:23.991 --> 35:26.341
- All right, Marty, it's over.

35:30.824 --> 35:33.827
- Jay, any word on Nick?
- Uh, yeah.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.568
Vince said he's critical
but stable,

35:35.611 --> 35:37.091
they think
he's gonna pull through.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.614
- That's good.
- Yeah.

35:38.658 --> 35:40.225
I heard you made a nice disarm.
- Oh, man.

35:40.268 --> 35:42.314
You want details?
- Yeah, I'm losing my mind.

35:42.357 --> 35:44.316
- After six days?
- After six minutes.

35:44.359 --> 35:47.493
- Hey, Burgess, you got a sec?
- What--yeah.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.712
Uh, I'll meet up with you guys.

35:51.801 --> 35:53.325
What's up?

35:59.244 --> 36:02.203
- Internet said
it was an appropriate gift.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.512
- How'd you know?

36:06.555 --> 36:08.253
I've been a cop a long time.

36:08.296 --> 36:10.516
Plus,
if you listen hard enough,

36:10.559 --> 36:12.692
you and Ruzek have voices
that really carry.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.392
- Am I crazy?

36:17.436 --> 36:20.656
- Maybe, but...

36:20.700 --> 36:22.354
I don't know,
some of the best decisions

36:22.397 --> 36:25.226
we ever make
start out as crazy.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.576
So...

36:27.620 --> 36:29.491
go with your gut, Burgess.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.617
- What's going on?

37:51.660 --> 37:53.662
- Nothing, just wanna talk.

37:55.316 --> 37:56.578
- About?

37:59.886 --> 38:01.322
- Everything.

38:04.107 --> 38:06.675
- I was hoping for something
a little more specific.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.160
- I've been thinking
about things.

38:13.203 --> 38:15.336
- Okay.
- About...

38:17.295 --> 38:20.515
Thinking about, uh,
you know what we talked about,

38:20.559 --> 38:23.475
about you and me, the baby--
- Okay.

38:23.518 --> 38:26.042
- Us, and um...

38:47.020 --> 38:49.414
I think maybe
we should get married.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.417
- Married?

38:52.460 --> 38:55.681
- Yeah, married,
like for real married.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.683
I mean, I know I screwed up
last time...

38:59.641 --> 39:02.905
But things are different now.
I'm different now.

39:05.081 --> 39:06.822
So, married, yeah.

39:06.866 --> 39:08.911
- Yeah.

39:17.572 --> 39:19.313
You have any thoughts on this?

39:19.357 --> 39:20.662
'Cause I'm just
kind of standing here.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.577
- I think
it's a really bad idea.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.539
- Sorry.

39:27.582 --> 39:28.757
I didn't mean to be so--
- Honest.

39:28.801 --> 39:31.107
It's all right.
- No, it's just--come on.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.893
I don't wanna get married right
now, and you don't either.

39:33.936 --> 39:35.895
You're just scared, you're
trying to do the right thing.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.549
- Yeah, I'm definitely
trying to do the right thing,

39:37.592 --> 39:39.115
and I keep failing.
It's just like...

39:42.597 --> 39:43.903
I don't know what to do, Kim,

39:43.946 --> 39:46.471
I'm just trying to be
a good guy.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.995
- Yeah, I know.
You are a good guy.

39:49.038 --> 39:51.954
Come on.
That's why I love you.

39:54.479 --> 39:57.438
But we are different,

39:57.482 --> 40:00.528
and we're not meant
to be together.

40:00.572 --> 40:04.445
Not now,
not as husband and wife anyway.

40:07.056 --> 40:09.755
But...

40:09.798 --> 40:14.803
we're meant
to be family, right?

40:14.847 --> 40:16.457
It may not be perfect,

40:16.501 --> 40:17.676
or what either one of us
imagined

40:17.719 --> 40:20.505
a long time ago, but...

40:25.161 --> 40:28.817
From now on, no matter what,
we'll be in it together, okay?

40:33.300 --> 40:34.867
Yeah.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.962
Yeah.

40:50.273 --> 40:53.146
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

40:53.189 --> 40:54.756
- Thank you.
