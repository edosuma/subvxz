Hi.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.399
Thank you so much
for coming up during rush hour.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.532
- Was it awful?
- Yeah.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.278
That's why I'm a little late.
Sorry, the traffic was terrible.

07:35.372 --> 07:36.453
Oh, don't worry about it.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.434
I just have to be done by 6:00.
I have to get my face on.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.415
That's right,
you're having a party.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.418
How wonderful.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.230
Just a little dinner party.
You know, a few people,

07:43.254 --> 07:45.337
but I'm so glad
you could make it.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.003
Kathy:
Tara's loving college.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.294
So many interesting people.
It's very diverse.

07:51.388 --> 07:55.348
Gays and trans
and people from all over.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.392
Her roommate is a Jewish girl
from New York.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.770
She's just having
a great experience.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.433
That's awesome.
I need to call her.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.476
I miss Tara.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.442
I'm just so relieved
because, you know,

08:06.528 --> 08:08.485
I mean all I knew
was places in Ohio

08:08.571 --> 08:10.779
and I just couldn't imagine why
she'd want to leave here

08:10.907 --> 08:12.899
and spend four years
of her life in Ohio.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.447
How are you, Beatriz?

08:18.415 --> 08:19.496
I'm okay.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.746
What? Only okay?
What's wrong?

08:27.132 --> 08:28.213
MY goat.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.835
My neighbor complained
about my goat.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.097
This neighbor, he's crazy.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.264
He's always drinking and angry.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.472
He came to my house
at 11:00 at night

08:44.482 --> 08:47.520
and he said that they were gonna
come and take away my goats.

08:48.611 --> 08:49.611
Who were?

08:49.738 --> 08:50.819
The city, you know?

08:50.947 --> 08:53.314
'Cause they think they're
nuisance animals.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.357
It's not zoned for goats.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.574
<i>On, right.</i>

08:56.870 --> 08:58.532
They run to me
when I come home.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.362
They're so happy to see me.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.497
But they bleat a lot.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.538
So I bring them in the house

09:05.628 --> 09:08.962
and I make them a little pen
in my bedroom.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.874
<i>But last Saturday,
I let them out</i>

09:11.968 --> 09:14.961
and Hercules, he likes to burrow
near the house.

09:20.518 --> 09:21.679
But Jeronimo...

09:25.732 --> 09:27.098
Beatriz?

09:30.528 --> 09:31.528
<i>Oh, no.</i>

09:32.947 --> 09:34.279
What happened?

09:36.618 --> 09:39.110
(stammers)
He killed my goat.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.452
What?

09:41.998 --> 09:43.159
Who, your neighbor?

09:43.249 --> 09:44.285
I came back from the walk

09:44.417 --> 09:47.535
and Jeronimo was dead
in the garden.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.127
His neck was broken.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.543
Are you serious?

09:52.467 --> 09:56.006
And I could feel his pain.
He was already dead,

09:56.096 --> 09:58.588
I could still feel his pain.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.016
I held him when he was
a little baby.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.850
He was such a fun personality.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.451
I'm sorry.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.370
I didn't mean to upset you right
before your party.

10:22.539 --> 10:23.620
I will burn some sage.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.914
No, it's okay, Beatriz.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.829

My car is not working.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.624
Oh, no.
Did you call AAA?

11:17.635 --> 11:19.877
No I called a friend.
He knows how to fix cars.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.094
He's almost done with work

11:21.181 --> 11:22.491
and then he's gonna
come and help me.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.515
He's fixed it before.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.636
From Altadena?

11:24.642 --> 11:26.554
He doesn't mind.
He's my friend.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.227
Right, but how long do you think
it'll take him to get here?

11:29.314 --> 11:33.228
He has to finish work
and there might be traffic.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.651
Well, you can just
stay for dinner.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.940
It's just a work thing
is the only thing.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.863
- Ah, no.
- Let me talk to Grant.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.656
No, I can just wait anywhere.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.345
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It should be fine.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.361
I can even wait
in the car if you want.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.657
Don't be silly.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.080
I have a book I can read.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.940
Uh, yeah.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.386
I told her she could
have dinner here.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.347
So what do you want me to do?
Do you want me to have her

12:26.371 --> 12:27.703
eat in the TV room by herself?

12:27.747 --> 12:28.783
Yeah.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.619
Really?
' Why not?

12:31.709 --> 12:32.995
Because I'm not gonna do that.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.772
Because she's not a housekeeper
or something,

12:34.796 --> 12:35.898
she's a friend of the family.

12:35.922 --> 12:36.922
She is?

12:37.006 --> 12:39.339
Grant, she did so much for Tara.

okay with what you're wearing?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.373
How do you feel?

13:13.459 --> 13:14.779
Maybe I have a sweater
or a blouse

13:14.836 --> 13:16.168
or maybe Tara has something.

Can I offer either
of you an aperitif?

know Kathy and Grant?

I know them through Tara.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.439
I'm a health therapist.

- I see.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.320
So, you're a nutritionist?

15:48.364 --> 15:49.730
Alex has kidney stones.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.570
Yeah, I mean, apparently just
like crystals form in my urine,

15:52.702 --> 15:54.910
you know, which is apparently
not that uncommon, right, babe?

15:54.912 --> 15:55.993

No, I thought he was dying.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.436
I mean, I didn't know
what was happening.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.668
He fell to the ground.
I called for the kids.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.148
I mean, I don't know
what I was thinking.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.538
I guess I wanted them

16:05.631 --> 16:07.025
to maybe just say goodbye
to their father.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.881
Yeah, they were traumatized.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.417
He was lying
on the ground screaming.

16:10.553 --> 16:11.864
I was hysterical,
the kids didn't know

16:11.888 --> 16:12.924
what the hell was going on.

16:12.930 --> 16:13.930
It was awful.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.555
Uh, Grey Goose,
splash of cran.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.007
- Thank you.
- And Jack and Coke.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.623
- Thank you.
- Can I get you anything?

16:19.228 --> 16:20.969
- Just water.
- You sure?

16:21.063 --> 16:22.304
Is there any wine?

16:22.440 --> 16:24.022
Of course, yeah,
red or white?

16:25.359 --> 16:26.816
Maybe a little white wine.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.815
- Okay, a little bit of white.
- Yes.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.397
You shouldn't be drinking
if you have kidney stones.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.948
I know, I know,
but tonight is...

16:33.034 --> 16:35.492
You can drink whatever you want
tonight, okay, babe?

16:36.412 --> 16:38.369
I mean, Alex is the reason
why we're celebrating.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.956
Alex got the legislator
to approve the development.

16:40.958 --> 16:41.958
It all passed today.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.037
It wasn't just me.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.330
Took a lot of people.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.379
Um, takes a village,
that's what they say.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.714
He's being modest.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.082
It was a huge deal.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.880
I mean, nobody thought
it was gonna pass.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.632
I had to fellate every single
state senator in California.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.505
- Oh, my God.
- A lot of guys.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.966
You know what's great
for kidney stones?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.972
Apple cider vinegar, beets,

17:01.020 --> 17:03.228
rhubarb, and dandelion root.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.143
Mm, dandelion root.
Babe, your favorite.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.474
Yeah, I love it. Anything else?
Anything edible?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.019
- It's a joke.
- (both chuckle)

17:30.007 --> 17:31.339
Doug is here.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.506
Okay, great.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.922
- He's at the gate.
- Wonderful.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.628
Alex and Shannon
are downstairs.

17:36.722 --> 17:37.929
Terrific.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.256
It's 6:13, Kathy.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.008
Perfect.
I'll be right down.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.184
<i>(music playing)</i>

18:21.017 --> 18:22.017
- Welcome.
- Hey, hey.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.059
- Hello.
- Hi, guys.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.426
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.977
Congratulations.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.850
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.190
- You look fantastic.
- Oh, so do you.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.691
- Hey, Shannon.
- Hi, Grant.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.185
Welcome.
How are you?

18:33.362 --> 18:34.728
- Remember Shannon?
- Hi.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.105
Hi, how are you?

18:36.324 --> 18:39.488
- Hi, I'm Alex.
- Alex. Jeana.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.410
I'm Shannon.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.662
- Love your tunic.
- Thank you.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.786
<i>- It's Jonny Balaine.
- Oh,</i> I <i>thought so.</i>

18:46.917 --> 18:48.408
Nice work, Alex.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.868
Hail the conquering hero.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.078
Only took a year and a half.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.088
Faster than some, right?

18:52.089 --> 18:53.830
Faster than most,
are you kidding?

18:53.924 --> 18:56.166
I knew her back when she had
that little shop in Balboa.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.509
Oh, my God,
I was her roommate.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.757
We lived together
for just like a month.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.255
(indistinct chatter)

19:08.105 --> 19:10.097
Listen, I told Cal
about tonight,

19:10.107 --> 19:12.315
but he's got this deposition
tomorrow morning.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.108
- Stupid lawsuit.
- I'm such a klutz on heels.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.547
I almost just broke
my ankle out there.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.652
Oh, don't sue.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.113
- (laughs)
- I won't.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.572
Let's get you a drink.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.116
(indistinct chatter)

19:36.425 --> 19:38.257
- Hi, guys.
- (ladies laugh)

19:42.098 --> 19:44.090
- Not even that exceptional.
- It's great.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.224
Oh, I love succulents.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.560
- Those are my favorite.
- Oh, I know. I do, too.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.478
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Evan.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.473
Thank you.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.150
- He's also a very talented...
- Thank you.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.485
...um, what do you call it?

19:57.571 --> 20:00.154
(gasps)
Beatriz, oh, my God.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.157
I'm so rude.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.030
Shannon, Jeana,
this is my dear friend Beatriz.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.156
- Oh.
- We met inside.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.278
Oh, good.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.159
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh!

20:08.207 --> 20:10.164
You're so beautiful.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.328
- Thank you.
- You all are.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.951
Beatriz is a healer.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.161
I am not even joking.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.829
She is a miracle worker.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.172
We met at the Ardendale Center.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.174
Do you guys know
to the Ardendale Center?

20:18.175 --> 20:20.667
- Uh-uh.
- It's a cancer...

20:20.845 --> 20:22.445
well, it's everything,
but mostly cancer.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.716
It's very food centered.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.422
A lot of alternative therapies.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.470
It's near Santa Monica.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.894
We went up there when Tara
was diagnosed with Hodgkin's.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.349
- Oh, my God.
- Cancer?

20:32.440 --> 20:33.601
- Yeah.
- I had no idea.

20:33.691 --> 20:36.058
She had it in her thymus,
she had it in her spleen.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.984
It was in the lining
above her diaphragm.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.193
It was really scary.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.196
- Sure.
- Of course.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.233
And she was 15.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.781
So I had to educate myself
completely...

20:43.909 --> 20:46.652
every doctor, every drug.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.910
And Grant is very left brain.
He's very by-the-book Western,

20:50.040 --> 20:51.406
so of course we did the whole

20:51.500 --> 20:53.867
surgery-chemo-radiation

20:54.003 --> 20:56.211
and Tara ended up NED.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.296
She's fine, thank God.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.958
But after the chemo,
she had no strength.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.177
She wasn't eating
and I'd heard about Ardendale.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.929
So we went down there
and she just took to it.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.423
She loved the food.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.725
She loved the therapies.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.226
And we met Beatriz.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.142
And Beatriz and Tara
just hit it off.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.224
- I love Tara.
- So then I started using her.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.942
And Grant, too.
Mostly just for massages.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.231
We're linked, you know?

21:21.447 --> 21:22.858
I think spiritually linked.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.231
The first time I met her,

21:25.326 --> 21:29.070
it was like I recognized her
just by the eyes.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.487
Recognized her as what?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.497
Maybe my mother
in another life

21:33.626 --> 21:35.242
or my daughter.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.245
You have unfinished business
with someone

21:38.255 --> 21:39.996
and then in the next life,

21:40.090 --> 21:41.501
they come back
in a different form.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.258
I love psychic stuff.

21:43.260 --> 21:46.344
Oh, I let this gypsy steal
$2,000 from me once.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.012
It was so humiliating.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.551
Tara is an old soul.

21:50.059 --> 21:53.268
She cares so much about animals
and nature.

21:53.771 --> 21:56.263
The earth needs old souls
because, you know,

21:56.273 --> 21:57.480
it is very sick.

21:58.275 --> 22:01.018
And the old souls
must help us

22:01.111 --> 22:03.444
find a way to heal the Earth.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.190
- That's a big responsibility.
- Yeah.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.779
Have you guys seen the pictures
of Zoey Mars?

22:11.914 --> 22:13.496
- Yes.
- What is that about?

22:13.791 --> 22:15.936
Doug and I were looking at them
in the car on the way over here.

22:15.960 --> 22:16.960
We almost threw up.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.939
Where is that girl's mother
is what I want to know.

22:18.963 --> 22:19.963
What? What happened?

22:20.089 --> 22:22.251
Oh, it's this reality star,
she's a...

22:22.299 --> 22:24.507
- She has a clothing line.
- ...tween singer.

22:24.593 --> 22:25.593
And her phone got hacked,

22:25.719 --> 22:27.927
so there's these pictures
all over the Internet

22:28.013 --> 22:31.222
that she apparently sent her
gynecologist of her vagina.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.308
- Oh.
- Poor girl.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.848
<i>- She has herpes, yeah.
- Kathy: It's awful.</i>

22:35.980 --> 22:39.189
So she has all these crusty
red inflamed sores

22:39.275 --> 22:40.391
all over her vagina.

22:40.526 --> 22:41.586
How do they know
it's her vagina?

22:41.610 --> 22:43.397
'Cause you can see her face
in the photos.

22:43.529 --> 22:44.589
Shannon:
How can you be so stupid?

22:44.613 --> 22:46.024
<i>Kathy:
It's really sad, actually.</i>

22:46.156 --> 22:47.237
I mean, she was hacked.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.987
Well, her career's over.
I mean, if you see the pictures.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.069
You wanna see the pictures?

22:53.330 --> 22:54.821
<i>Shannon:
I still have to eat.</i>

22:54.957 --> 22:55.957
<i>No.</i>

22:56.125 --> 22:57.332
<i>No, no, I-
no, no.</i>

22:57.334 --> 22:59.075
(women laughing)

22:59.336 --> 23:00.747
Shannon:
Oh, <i>my</i> God.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.001
In a way,
it's kind of amazing.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.344
Uh-huh.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.713
(Shannon laughs)

23:12.433 --> 23:14.425
<i>(indistinct chatter)</i>

23:21.650 --> 23:23.712

give the girls a little tour.</i>

Grant:
Sounds good.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.394

- Jesus, Doug.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.807
That one goes in the memoirs.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.139
It's going in the memoirs.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.954
- I'm writing a memoir.
- Bullshit, really?

24:04.068 --> 24:05.809
Yeah, we got a deal
with Random House.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.895
Just gotta get around
to writing it.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.397
But I'm always coming up
with titles.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.114
- You want to hear some?
- Hell, yeah.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.604
- Of course, hit me.
- Doug: Yeah.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.278
"Life Is A Game

24:16.372 --> 24:17.612
Big picture of me on the cover.

- Alex: Done. That? it.

Guys, um, before dinner,

24:43.941 --> 24:45.661
I just wanted to give you
a little heads up.

24:45.693 --> 24:47.650
Can I get another
bourbon, hon?

24:48.737 --> 24:50.729
Oh, no, no, Doug.
This is...

24:51.365 --> 24:52.731
uh, this is Beatriz.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.260
I'm sorry you
weren't introduced.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.887
She's our guest.
She's staying for dinner.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.949
Oh. Okay.
You were hovering.

24:59.081 --> 25:00.743
I just figured you were
part of the staff.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.594
- I'll go and get you a drink.
- Oh, thanks.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.910
- Alex?
- Uh, Jack and Coke.

25:06.463 --> 25:07.749
Can I have another?

25:08.716 --> 25:10.457
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:10.467 --> 25:11.753
Uh, wine?

25:22.104 --> 25:23.640
So, where are you from?

25:23.731 --> 25:24.892
Altadena.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.439
Ah.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.724
Where are you really from?

25:29.319 --> 25:32.403
I was born
in Tlaltecuhtli, Mexico.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.071
Tlalte...

25:34.408 --> 25:37.071
- Tlaltecuhtli.
- Tlaltecuhtli.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.488
On the Pacific.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.111
It was very beautiful once.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.447
Mexico is awesome.
I love Cancun.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.492
But now many hotels,
timeshares.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.623
A lot of crime, I think.

25:48.589 --> 25:49.625
And where are you from?

25:49.757 --> 25:50.838
Laguna.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.923
But we have houses in...

25:53.594 --> 25:55.586
well, we're all over.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.178
But where are you
really from?

25:59.641 --> 26:01.257
I was born in Oaxaca.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.677
(Doug laughs)

26:05.773 --> 26:07.981
No, no,
I was born in San Diego.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.558
(men laughing)

26:10.527 --> 26:11.563
Now I've got the giggles.

26:14.740 --> 26:15.740
Do I know you?

26:16.200 --> 26:18.533
Oh, Doug's famous.
He's been on the news.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.867
You know, he's a mogul.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.988
I have opinions and because
I have money, people listen.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.954
I don't know why,
but I think I know you.

26:27.044 --> 26:28.535
Well, maybe.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.037
Ever dance in Vegas?
(laughs)

26:33.050 --> 26:34.541
(phone chimes)

26:35.552 --> 26:36.793
Excuse me.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.555
(speaks Spanish)

26:42.976 --> 26:45.013
And this is Tara's room.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.185
Oh, pretty.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.687
(gasps)

26:49.108 --> 26:50.565
- Lucky girl.
- Yeah.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.024
(women laugh)

26:52.569 --> 26:54.185
Aw, that was her last summer.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.566
- Jeana: Oh.
- Shannon: Aw.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.271
- Beautiful eyes.
- All grown up.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.368
Yeah.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.328
And this is her while
she was in treatment.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.534
She had to have
so many rounds of chemo.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.198
It was awful.
It almost killed her.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.499
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.042
And that's Beatriz?

27:10.420 --> 27:11.420
Yes.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.585
During her recovery,
Beatriz was so helpful.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.587
I'm telling you,
this woman is a saint.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.336
It's like birds fly out of the
sky and land on her shoulder.

27:19.429 --> 27:20.795
Aw, it's like Snow White.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.075
We had a baby nurse like that.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.556
When she left,
Alex and I sobbed.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.828
- Really?
- Now we're gonna have to

27:24.852 --> 27:27.310
get up in the middle
of the night and hold the baby.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.313
Kidding.
We loved her.

27:30.399 --> 27:31.668
She was like a member
of the family.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.900
Well, Beatriz's family
had to leave their home

27:34.027 --> 27:37.065
when she was a little girl
in Mexico and they were so poor

27:37.156 --> 27:38.956
that they all had to separate
from each other.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.607
So she never really
knew her mother

27:40.659 --> 27:43.572
and then she was raised
by her grandmother

27:43.620 --> 27:45.953
and then her grandmother died
and she was all alone.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.623
And then she married
a guy here

27:48.667 --> 27:50.875
and he disappeared...

27:51.003 --> 27:52.835
- God.
- ...or got killed.

27:52.921 --> 27:53.921
Kathy.

27:57.050 --> 28:00.088
I'm so sorry, but my friend
that was gonna fix my VW

28:00.179 --> 28:01.795
cannot come until
tomorrow morning.

28:02.431 --> 28:03.512
I don't know what to do.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.721
Stay here.

28:05.309 --> 28:06.345
I feel bad.

28:06.476 --> 28:07.808
What?
Don't you feel bad.

28:07.895 --> 28:08.895
Don't you ever feel bad.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.541
You can stay right here
in Tara's room.

28:10.647 --> 28:13.355
- Are you sure?
- I insist.

28:14.610 --> 28:15.646
Thank you, Kathy.

28:15.652 --> 28:18.235
The only thing I ask is that you
take one of Tara's guitars

28:18.322 --> 28:19.674
and you sing us
a song after dinner.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.190
Beatriz has the most incredible
singing voice.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.572
I need to call my friend
to stop at my house

28:25.662 --> 28:27.073
and check on my dogs
and my goat.

28:27.164 --> 28:28.530
Oh, yeah. Do that.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.042
Thank you, Kathy.

28:31.668 --> 28:34.376
Stop thanking me.
Thank you for being here.

28:34.504 --> 28:35.665
Thank you.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.498
Oh. So sweet.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.879
Did she say goat?

28:45.682 --> 28:47.922
When you're ready, we'd like
to invite you in for dinner.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.227
Oh, great.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.016
I'm glad this worked out.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.692
Doug, I know you have
a busy schedule

28:57.694 --> 28:59.130
and it's so great
that you were in town

28:59.154 --> 29:01.612
<i>when the good news came in
and we were all able to gather-</i>

29:01.698 --> 29:02.698
Let me just say...

29:02.699 --> 29:04.941
- or, did I cut you off?
- No, no, go ahead.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.409
<i>I don't wanna cut off the host.</i>

29:06.495 --> 29:07.702
All yours.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.330
Well, first,

29:10.499 --> 29:13.242
I want to say on behalf
of Jeana and myself,

29:13.377 --> 29:15.539
thank you for having us
at your stunning home.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.499
And of course,
to you, Kathy,

29:17.589 --> 29:18.921
for helping make this dinner.

29:19.174 --> 29:20.540
You did help make the dinner?

29:20.634 --> 29:22.074
<i>- God. Doug.
- Kathy: Well, I didn't.</i>

29:22.219 --> 29:23.585
But I did plan the menu.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.092
And I know that sounds easy,
but when you have OCD like I do,

29:26.223 --> 29:27.617
you know it took me
about three weeks.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.041
And uncatered food
is the best food.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.634
Kathy, in all seriousness,
you are the consummate host.

29:31.728 --> 29:32.764
You are a knockout.

29:32.854 --> 29:35.642
And if I wasn't on my third
wife, I'd steal you away.

29:35.732 --> 29:36.732
Oh, thank you.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.858
I would personally love
a sister wife. Trust me.

29:38.986 --> 29:43.731
And I couldn't be more pleased
and frankly, surprised

29:43.782 --> 29:46.365
at how smoothly
this whole process has gone.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.444
Thanks in large part
to Alex's efforts.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.954
- Alex.
- (clapping)

29:52.040 --> 29:54.623
And, Alex, if any of those
efforts were illegal,

29:54.710 --> 29:56.667
I do not know you
nor was I even here tonight.

29:56.753 --> 29:58.745
Neither was I.
And it's my house.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.748
I hope that this is the
beginning of along partnership

30:01.758 --> 30:03.750
between Veriden and Rife.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.343
And I think that we are all
gonna make

30:06.430 --> 30:08.513
a lot of fucking money.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.756
(all laugh)

30:10.600 --> 30:11.761
Kathy:
Cheers.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.636
Tonight you have a choice
of two entrees.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.165
- The chef has prepared...
- I would just like to say

30:16.189 --> 30:18.772
to Kathy and Grant,
thank you for having me tonight.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.774
<i>I know you were
not expecting me,</i>

30:20.819 --> 30:23.232
but I love Tara.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.563
<i>I love your family.</i>

30:24.698 --> 30:26.735
And I love being in your house.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.774
And it's an honor
to meet all of you.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.117
Aw, so sweet, thank you.

30:30.746 --> 30:33.146
And I would like to give you all
treatments, free, of course,

30:33.206 --> 30:36.370
as my way of saying thank you
for including me tonight.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.580
Oh, no, Beatriz,
you don't have to do that.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.772
A treatment?
What do you mean?

30:39.796 --> 30:41.708
She's a masseuse, Doug.
She gives massages.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.380
We're getting free massages?

30:43.633 --> 30:45.295
- All of us at the same time?
- Oh.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.384
- You wish, you sicko.
- (all laughing)

30:47.471 --> 30:50.384
You would have to come to
the center in Santa Monica.

30:50.474 --> 30:52.466
- I have an office.
- You have an office?

30:52.601 --> 30:54.809
- Good for you.
- We have many treatments.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.516
Rolfing, breath therapy...

30:57.647 --> 31:00.014
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
I need to take everyone's order.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.726
You have a choice of either
the grilled halibut

31:02.819 --> 31:03.819
or the beef tenderloin.

31:03.820 --> 31:04.901
Well, I'll have the beef.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.090
I'll have the beef too, please.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.026
- Halibut please.
- Beef.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.277
Uh, fish for me.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.031
I'll have the halibut.
And Beatriz is a vegetarian,

31:12.204 --> 31:14.241
so if we could
just put some vegetables

31:14.331 --> 31:16.744
and rice and salad on her plate,
that'd be great, thank you.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.699
Thank you, Kathy.
That's perfect.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.831
Rolfing, huh?
You go to school for that?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.588
Well, when I first came
to the United States

31:23.715 --> 31:25.707
- a long time ago...
- Did you come legally?

31:27.219 --> 31:28.835
- Yes.
- Now, how'd that work?

31:29.096 --> 31:31.463
<i>I had family here
on my mother? side.</i>

31:31.556 --> 31:32.842
<i>When my grandmother died-</i>

31:32.933 --> 31:34.799
<i>Doug:
They're all citizens or-</i>

31:36.853 --> 31:38.970
<i>- You're grilling her.
- Doug: I'm curious.</i>

31:39.106 --> 31:40.847
A lot of people
come here illegally.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.390
I was interested how she did it.

31:42.526 --> 31:43.767
<i>Jeana:
Okay. Just ignore him.</i>

31:43.860 --> 31:46.853
So you came here however,
who cares, and then?

31:46.863 --> 31:49.150
I found a job
at a health food market.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.862
I didn't speak any English,

31:51.868 --> 31:55.862
so my job was just to clean
and lay out the fresh food.

31:55.997 --> 31:59.616
<i>But there was a pharmacist
there, Dr. Shibari.</i>

32:00.127 --> 32:03.165
And he taught me everything
about alternative medicine.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.879
All the therapies.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.414
He was like a father to me.

32:06.550 --> 32:07.631
The father I wish I had.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.295
So great to have a mentor.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.795
<i>Beatriz:
Dr. Shibari was a wonderful man.</i>

32:11.972 --> 32:13.213
Very wise.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.431
He saved my life, I think,

32:15.559 --> 32:19.553
because I always had inside me
the desire to be a healer...

32:19.688 --> 32:22.021
Good for you. You're working.
You're contributing.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.473
Must be very fulfilling.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.229
Uh, I just wanted
to mention, uh...

32:25.360 --> 32:29.570
From the time I was very little,
I have these feelings.

32:29.906 --> 32:32.899
<i>I remember! was maybe
six years old.</i>

32:32.909 --> 32:34.491
My father was a fisherman

32:34.578 --> 32:36.535
and he took me
to the sea to fish.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.905
We were on this little pier,
you know,

32:38.915 --> 32:42.875
and, he pulled up
an octopus.

32:43.420 --> 32:47.380
<i>A big, beautiful, white,
very white octopus.</i>

32:47.632 --> 32:49.715
I had never seen
anything like that.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.509
And my father

32:52.596 --> 32:54.212
starts kicking the octopus.

32:55.390 --> 32:59.179
He kicked it down that pier
like if it was a football.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.520
He was stomping on it
like a crazy man.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.397
<i>And then he starts kicking it
towards me.</i>

33:05.650 --> 33:09.940
Then he said to me,
"Beatriz, kill it."

33:10.739 --> 33:12.401
<i>I</i> look down at the octopus

33:12.491 --> 33:14.278
and I touched it.

33:14.409 --> 33:18.653
<i>And this shock went through
my whole body.</i>

33:19.748 --> 33:23.116
I could feel the pain
of this octopus.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.952
- It was electric.
- You're very sensitive.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.245
Maybe it was an electric eel.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.337
When I'm on a table,
she can sense exactly

33:29.424 --> 33:31.152
where I'm storing my stress.
It's usually in my...

33:31.176 --> 33:33.213
Have you ever seen
a white octopus?

33:33.345 --> 33:35.758
Yes, terrifying.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.383
He forced me
to go scuba diving.

33:37.474 --> 33:39.466
I was fucking out of there.
I had a panic attack.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.601
- Kathy:...fuses to the bone.
- Really? That sucks.

33:41.645 --> 33:42.645
<i>Kathy:
Yeah, I know.</i>

33:42.771 --> 33:44.499
- This looks great.
- Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

33:44.523 --> 33:45.750
For those of you with the beef,

33:45.774 --> 33:48.733
it's a tenderloin
with a garlic horseradish cream.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.859
<i>And the fish is a grilled
Alaskan halibut</i>

33:50.946 --> 33:52.278
<i>with a lemon-dill vinaigrette.</i>

33:52.405 --> 33:53.605
<i>- Mm.
- Kathy: Thank you, Evan.</i>

33:53.657 --> 33:55.092
- So tasty.
- Alex: So just a heads up,

33:55.116 --> 33:56.857
um, got word
at the end of the day

33:56.952 --> 33:59.285
that the NR DC's gonna be
filing a suit against the bill.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.404
Of course they are.
Fuck them.

34:01.498 --> 34:03.956
That's why we need
to break ground immediately.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.662
Just get going Monday morning.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.001
<i>Grant: We're on it, Doug.
We're on the same page.</i>

34:07.003 --> 34:09.871
Doug: Because until a judge
issues an injunction,

34:09.965 --> 34:12.456
it is completely
within our rights

34:12.551 --> 34:14.338
- to start clearing the land.
- For sure.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.708
It's just they found some nests
of a few protected birds.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.241
- Move them.
- Grant: <i>That? what we'll have to do.</i>

34:18.264 --> 34:20.618
Alex: Exactly. And obviously
there's still a lot of permitting

34:20.641 --> 34:22.725
<i>because the county
and the state are dragging ass.</i>

34:22.851 --> 34:24.889
The permitting is for
the construction, okay?

34:24.980 --> 34:27.097
- We can still clear the land.
- Right, yes, true.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.232
And if we wait to clear it,
there could be hiccups.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.559
I've been down this road before.

34:31.735 --> 34:34.649
Once you've cleared the land,
there's nothing left to protect.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.634
There's nothing to protest.
There's nothing to fight about.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.024
<i>Grant:
Hundred percent. I agree.</i>

34:38.034 --> 34:41.027
Jackie in my office also
did mention there's talk online

34:41.079 --> 34:43.742
of a few activists,
super marginal players,

34:43.873 --> 34:45.864
who, you know,
may be handcuffing themselves

34:45.958 --> 34:47.370
to the fences outside
the work site.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.243
- I've had worse.
- Grant: So have we.

34:49.754 --> 34:52.371
Once, we built a hotel in Panama

34:52.507 --> 34:54.293
<i>and some locals blew up
one of our trucks</i>

34:54.426 --> 34:58.010
with a fucking bomb.
So, you know, bring it on.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.054
<i>(Doug chuckles)</i>

34:59.097 --> 35:01.180
The most important thing
is to start.

35:01.308 --> 35:02.469
We start.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.058
And once we start,
we have the momentum.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.767
This is why I love
working with you.

35:05.854 --> 35:06.890
<i>No canvassing.</i>

35:07.063 --> 35:09.271
<i>Usually there are so many
meetings and hand-wringing.</i>

35:09.357 --> 35:11.690
<i>Doug: Benefit of a privately
owned company, pal.</i>

35:11.776 --> 35:13.062
It's the history of progress.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.019
- One man's <i>will.</i>
- What is this man's name?

35:15.071 --> 35:16.733
<i>- It's me and my will.
- Doug</i> what?

35:16.990 --> 35:19.073
- Strutt.
- How do you spell it?

35:19.117 --> 35:20.733
Hm?

35:20.869 --> 35:23.077
Shannon could really use you
on one of her projects.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.911
That's right.
I'm project director

35:24.998 --> 35:26.580
on a refinery
we're building in France.

35:26.708 --> 35:28.468
- I mean talk about bureaucracy.
- Excuse me.

35:28.501 --> 35:29.941
France is like
a third world country.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.323
You can't get anything
done there.

35:31.713 --> 35:33.079
I hate France.
Hate the French.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.205
(laughs)

35:34.341 --> 35:36.378
<i>(indistinct chatter)</i>

35:43.016 --> 35:45.099
(speaking Spanish)

36:09.417 --> 36:10.624
Bye.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.545
The wife, mother-in-law,
two aunts,

36:18.635 --> 36:20.071
one of them lived
even though the bullet

36:20.095 --> 36:21.631
went in her skull
and came out her jaw.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.129
It was just three blocks
from our house.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.926
Yeah, we used to see
them at Starbucks.

36:25.058 --> 36:27.141
- I mean, what is going on?
- People are fucking nuts.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.554
People are insane.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.179
So, Doug, you build hotels?

36:32.148 --> 36:33.148
I don't build them, no.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.600
He builds things.
I just own them.

36:36.403 --> 36:37.644
You own hotels?

36:39.155 --> 36:41.613
Have you ever,
owned any in Mexico?

36:41.700 --> 36:43.157
Yeah, a few.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.368
Did you have one
in Tlaltecuhtli?

36:46.663 --> 36:48.655
Tlalte... pla... what?

36:49.165 --> 36:50.281
Tlaltecuhtli.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.162
(stutters)
Tlaltecuhtli.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.168
- Tlaltecuhtli.
- I don't know.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.535
I don't even know where that is.

36:54.629 --> 36:57.167
In Guerrero, north of Acapulco.

36:57.674 --> 37:01.042
I partner on a hotel in Cancun
and one in San Miguel.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.173
This was a resort
with a golf course.

37:03.179 --> 37:05.091
It closed. It was only
open for a year.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.181
Mine don't close.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.139
Mostly.

37:10.812 --> 37:13.179
(sighs)
This tenderloin was amazing.

37:13.189 --> 37:15.181
So was the fish.
So buttery. Flaky.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.477
I'm so glad.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.185
This hotel destroyed
my whole town.

37:19.654 --> 37:21.486
<i>The Mexican government
told the people</i>

37:21.614 --> 37:24.197
that they were gonna
have many jobs at the hotel,

37:24.284 --> 37:25.900
that there would be work.

37:26.661 --> 37:29.153
They were very excited at first

37:30.206 --> 37:33.199
but then they took
their land illegally.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.750
All these people had
to leave their homes

37:35.879 --> 37:38.246
with nothing
and nowhere to go.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.296
My family, too.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.546
- Oh, no.
- There were protests.

37:43.136 --> 37:45.549
A lot of people were killed
by the Mexican police.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.546
<i>Assassinated.
It's a fact.</i>

37:47.682 --> 37:48.843
Shit. Jesus.

37:48.933 --> 37:52.597
They dug up all the canals,
cut away the mangrove trees.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.470
It was an American hotel.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.268
I can't remember the name.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.768
Hyatt? Hilton?
Sheridan?

37:57.901 --> 37:59.142
It was 40 years ago.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.817
- Four Seasons?
- I'm old, sweetheart.

38:00.904 --> 38:01.940
I'm not that old.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.734
When I first saw you, I thought
I knew you from somewhere.

38:04.866 --> 38:06.778
And then you started
speaking about people

38:06.868 --> 38:08.109
protesting your hotel.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.240
It's not a hotel.
It's a shopping center.

38:11.247 --> 38:14.206
And no one's getting kicked out
of their homes

38:14.250 --> 38:15.536
except maybe a few birds.

38:15.668 --> 38:17.034
(chuckles)

38:17.128 --> 38:19.106
Honey, why don't we eat
our dessert in the living room?

38:19.130 --> 38:20.621
Yes. Great.

38:20.715 --> 38:21.795
Let's all stretch our legs.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.560
Doug, I'm sorry if I...

38:36.564 --> 38:39.056
just know that I'm happy
for your project.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.480
- Thanks, hon.
- No, really.

38:44.531 --> 38:45.531
You're warm.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.201
Oh!

38:50.286 --> 38:51.286
Wow.

38:51.287 --> 38:52.778
Hey, this is my lucky day.

38:53.998 --> 38:54.998
Oh, your neck,

38:55.124 --> 38:56.956
there's a lot of tension
in your neck.

38:57.085 --> 38:58.667
She's a miracle worker, Doug.

39:01.798 --> 39:03.164
(Doug exhales)

39:05.301 --> 39:07.839
<i>(music playing)</i>

39:40.336 --> 39:44.330
Oh.
Oh, that was great.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.614
Chocolate and raspberry,
the absolute best.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.398
- Jeana: It's so creamy.
- Shannon: Isn't it?

39:52.432 --> 39:54.173
<i>Kathy: Beatriz, I think
we have some sorbet.</i>

39:54.267 --> 39:56.120
<i>Can you check to see if we
have some sorbet for Beatriz?</i>

39:56.144 --> 39:57.806
I think we have a pineapple
or a mango.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.057
Absolutely.

39:59.188 --> 40:00.599
How are your sons, Doug?

40:00.732 --> 40:02.473
Oh, they're great.

40:02.567 --> 40:03.978
Jack has his fun.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.025
<i>He's just raking it in,
hand over fist.</i>

40:06.154 --> 40:07.554
<i>He's gonna be richer
than all of us.</i>

40:07.780 --> 40:09.442
<i>I got to say,
I get almostjealous</i>

40:09.574 --> 40:11.531
<i>when I see how easy it is
for these guys</i>

40:11.618 --> 40:15.532
from banking to just pull these
pots of gold out of thin air.

40:15.622 --> 40:16.658
I know.
It's sick, right?

40:16.789 --> 40:18.155
For me,

40:18.249 --> 40:20.787
way more satisfying,
what I do.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.368
Yeah, it's not always easy.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.787
Every step is a slog.

40:24.881 --> 40:26.859
- The struggle is real.
- But you're building something.

40:26.883 --> 40:29.216
It's not all transactional.

40:29.302 --> 40:32.420
You're changing the dynamics
of things, real things.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.047
You get a vision of a place
in your head

40:35.183 --> 40:36.390
and then, poof, it exists.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.843
- You're writing history.
- Totally agree.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.724
Doug: And Calvin's working
with me at Rife.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.391
And he's a natural.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.390
We got exactly
the same instincts.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.811
That's so neat, Doug.

40:45.902 --> 40:48.440
And when I hang it up,
whenever that day comes,

40:48.529 --> 40:50.737
I have no doubt that he
will carry on the dynasty.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.403
<i>Grant: I don'! see you handing
over the reins any time soon.</i>

40:53.409 --> 40:55.401
Out of my cold,
dead hands, right?

40:55.411 --> 40:56.743
(all laughing)

40:57.622 --> 40:59.659
And they both have families
and grandkids.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.248
Everyone gets along with Jeana.

41:01.334 --> 41:02.415
I mean, mostly.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.625
- Uh-oh.
- No, we do.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.203
The big issue is where
we're gonna spend the holidays.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.830
Jack and Britney
are in Connecticut

41:07.924 --> 41:09.415
and they have
their house in St. Barth's.

41:09.425 --> 41:12.259
And Calvin's here,
and he has his place in Cabo,

41:12.345 --> 41:14.698
and we 're here and we have this
<i>place</i> we love on the <i>Big</i> Island.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.617
- War of the beach houses.
- I love the Big Island.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.133
- Yeah, we always lose.
- Jack's wife is not easy.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.664
We try to go away every summer.
It's just so hot now everywhere.

41:21.688 --> 41:22.688
And crowded. Ugh.

41:22.814 --> 41:23.958
I mean, the best weather
is right here.

41:23.982 --> 41:26.019
That's what I keep saying
to Kathy. Why leave?

41:26.150 --> 41:27.878
Actually, we're going to South
Africa in a couple of days.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.110
It's gonna be 115 degrees.

41:30.238 --> 41:31.382
- Oh, what's happening there?
- Grant: South Africa?

41:31.406 --> 41:32.406
For a safari.

41:32.448 --> 41:33.939
- Oh, amazing.
- Oh, cool.

41:34.075 --> 41:35.566
- I wanna go.
- You should come.

41:35.660 --> 41:36.992
No, seriously, come.

41:37.161 --> 41:39.369
I'm gonna be by myself all day
stuck at the lodge

41:39.455 --> 41:40.455
with little kids and Britney.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.448
- Unfortunately, I work.
- Where's Doug gonna be?

41:42.458 --> 41:44.700
Oh, he'll be gone all day
with Jack and Kelvin hunting.

41:45.169 --> 41:46.205
<i>Alex:
Hunting? Shit.</i>

41:46.337 --> 41:47.453
Yeah. It's Africa, right?

41:47.463 --> 41:49.483
<i>- Grant: What are you hunting?
- Jeana: Oh, don? go into it.</i>

41:49.507 --> 41:50.818
- You brought it up.
- Jeana: Okay.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.361
Well, it's true,
though, what they say.

41:52.385 --> 41:53.487
Those animals would
basically be gone

41:53.511 --> 41:54.571
if it wasn't for the hunting

41:54.595 --> 41:56.382
<i>because it's very important
to the economy.</i>

41:56.472 --> 41:57.508
<i>It keeps the parks going.</i>

41:57.598 --> 42:01.012
I have had,
all the rushes there are,

42:01.144 --> 42:03.511
every one.
I've been to the buffet of life.

42:03.604 --> 42:05.846
I've tasted everything
and I'm telling you,

42:05.982 --> 42:08.474
being in Africa, okay...

42:09.318 --> 42:11.935
where all the species
originated,

42:12.030 --> 42:13.692
every one, including us,

42:13.990 --> 42:15.777
<i>going out into the wild</i>

42:15.908 --> 42:17.649
<i>when it's still dark</i>

42:17.744 --> 42:20.487
and it's quiet,
except for these strange,

42:20.580 --> 42:24.164
prehistoric sounds,
and waiting...

42:25.501 --> 42:29.085
for some beast
to emerge out of the bush.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.129
There's no bigger rush.

42:31.299 --> 42:32.460
(chuckles)
I bet.

42:32.508 --> 42:33.715
There's no better high, not...

42:33.801 --> 42:35.633
not sex, not drugs,

42:35.762 --> 42:37.344
not money.

42:37.638 --> 42:40.426
And facing that creature down

42:40.516 --> 42:43.384
and looking in its eyes

42:43.478 --> 42:45.140
and taking it.

42:47.190 --> 42:49.102
<i>I don't consider it murder.</i>

42:49.192 --> 42:50.524
<i>I don't.</i>

42:50.902 --> 42:52.814
<i>It is a killing, obviously,</i>

42:52.904 --> 42:55.521
<i>but it's just this deep,</i>

42:55.531 --> 42:58.444
<i>primal thing.</i>

42:59.160 --> 43:02.494
<i>It's like this original dance
of man and beast,</i>

43:02.538 --> 43:03.779
<i>man and nature.</i>

43:03.915 --> 43:05.702
The struggle for survival.

43:05.792 --> 43:08.535
It's very pure.

43:11.172 --> 43:12.538
Not to get too airy-fairy.

43:12.548 --> 43:13.914
(all laugh)

43:14.008 --> 43:16.751
Yeah. I just can't imagine
doing it myself.

43:18.054 --> 43:19.795
- What kind of beast?
- Huh?

43:20.181 --> 43:21.672
What are you
hunting this time?

43:22.100 --> 43:24.137
Let's just say big game.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.455
- Grant: Well, come on, tell us.
- No. Let's not get into it.

43:26.479 --> 43:27.539
Some people can't handle it.

43:27.563 --> 43:29.555
Let me just show you a picture
from our last trip.

43:29.649 --> 43:31.311
<i>- Jeana: Oh, God.
- Doug: Hang on.</i>

43:31.692 --> 43:32.933
Where is it here?

43:33.569 --> 43:35.561
Here.
There you go.

43:37.490 --> 43:38.526
Wow.

43:38.616 --> 43:39.857
You shot that?

43:40.660 --> 43:43.277
Holy fuck.
That thing is massive.

43:43.412 --> 43:45.779
Doug: Yeah. Maybe 10 yards
from me, too.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.153
<i>Grant:
Don't look at that, Kathy.</i>

43:47.208 --> 43:48.208
I'm not going to.

43:48.292 --> 43:49.373
Oh, my God.

43:49.502 --> 43:52.586
Cost me a fortune for that one.
Almost didn't get it either.

43:52.588 --> 43:55.001
Yeah.
We knew it was out there,

43:55.091 --> 43:58.584
but it took us about
10 hours to find it.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.053
<i>Hunting is all about patience.</i>

44:03.057 --> 44:06.221
<i>We had to stalk it for,
like, all day.</i>

44:06.310 --> 44:11.271
<i>Then suddenly, out of nowhere,
we came on it.</i>

44:11.566 --> 44:14.183
<i>Jack spotted it in a clearing.</i>

44:15.319 --> 44:17.231
<i>Now those rhinos
can run.</i>

44:17.905 --> 44:18.905
<i>Trust me.</i>

44:19.031 --> 44:21.614
<i>They can move pretty good
and they're dangerous.</i>

44:21.617 --> 44:23.483
<i>Not as dangerous as hippos.</i>

44:23.619 --> 44:24.700
We got one of them, too.

44:24.829 --> 44:26.070
<i>Evan:
We did find some sorbet.</i>

44:26.164 --> 44:28.372
Mix here of pineapple,
passion fruit and guava.

44:28.499 --> 44:29.615
Are you for real?

44:32.295 --> 44:33.627
This is disgusting.

44:34.881 --> 44:37.089
- You killed this animal?
- Hey!

44:37.884 --> 44:39.625
- Hey, what?
- What is wrong with you?

44:39.635 --> 44:40.671
Beatriz, calm down.

44:41.637 --> 44:43.048
You think it's funny?

44:43.472 --> 44:44.679
<i>I don't think it's funny.</i>

44:45.099 --> 44:46.761
I think it's fucking sick.

44:49.896 --> 44:50.896
I told you.

44:51.022 --> 44:52.666
- Most people can't handle it.
- Doug, I'm...

44:52.690 --> 44:54.431
- I'm so sorry, man.
- I am so sorry.

44:54.525 --> 44:55.936
She's had a really hard week.

44:56.068 --> 44:57.809
- I don't know what to say.
- It's fine.

44:57.904 --> 45:01.397
Not everyone is like me.
And thank God, right?

45:01.699 --> 45:03.565
I'm just glad she didn't
break my phone.

45:03.659 --> 45:04.659
<i>Kathy:
Is it broken?</i>

45:04.660 --> 45:06.401
It does have a little crack,
actually.

45:06.495 --> 45:08.657
Oh, well we will replace that,
Doug, please.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.447
- Grant: Absolutely.
- It's fine.

45:12.793 --> 45:14.000
Does she get out much?

45:14.128 --> 45:15.915
(all laugh)

45:20.968 --> 45:22.175
Where is she?

45:22.720 --> 45:23.720
Should I offer coffee?

45:23.804 --> 45:26.421
No. Not yet.
Let them keep drinking.

45:31.687 --> 45:33.679
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry, Kathy.

45:33.689 --> 45:35.681
- Yeah. I don't...
- I saw it and I don't know.

45:35.733 --> 45:38.146
- I just flipped out.
- I get it. I just...

45:38.236 --> 45:40.774
You were so nice
to let me stay.

45:40.905 --> 45:43.568
I never drink like this.
I think I had three glasses.

45:44.700 --> 45:46.236
I've just been very emotional.

45:46.327 --> 45:47.943
I think you're just burned out.

45:48.079 --> 45:49.866
That's what it is.
You're burned out.

45:49.956 --> 45:50.956
It's hard what you do.

45:51.082 --> 45:53.039
One of my patients,
he's only 16.

45:53.125 --> 45:55.287
He's gonna die, Kathy,
and there's nothing I can do.

45:55.378 --> 45:57.791
It's horrible.
And then Jeronimo.

45:58.089 --> 45:59.876
I know. Aw.

46:01.676 --> 46:02.917
I'm so embarrassed.

46:03.386 --> 46:04.696
Do you think I should
go say something?

46:04.720 --> 46:07.963
I think maybe, honestly,
you should just go to bed.

46:08.391 --> 46:09.973
Just go to Tara's room, okay?

46:10.351 --> 46:12.889
It's fine. It didn't bother him.
He's a tough guy.

46:12.979 --> 46:15.562
That beautiful rhinoceros,
Kathy.

46:15.731 --> 46:17.563
- Why?
- Don't think about it.

46:17.733 --> 46:19.725
I'm so sorry.
I've ruined your party.

46:19.735 --> 46:21.226
I will take you
and Grant for dinner.

46:21.362 --> 46:22.523
I'll cook.

46:22.613 --> 46:23.729
- No.
- Free treatments.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.175
- Don't worry about it.
- Please, just let me

46:25.199 --> 46:27.236
give you free treatments
for the rest of your life.

46:27.368 --> 46:28.637
I do have to get back
to the group though.

46:28.661 --> 46:30.573
- Yes, of course.
- Go up to Tara's room.

46:30.663 --> 46:32.199
Go to bed.
I'll see you in the morning.

46:32.290 --> 46:34.122
- Thank you for everything.
- Okay.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.747
I never should drink like that.

46:38.170 --> 46:40.753
- I love you, Kathy.
- Aw. Good night.

46:42.133 --> 46:44.750
<i>(music playing)</i>

49:00.563 --> 49:02.179

51:40.931 --> 51:43.048

(men laughing)

51:56.071 --> 51:58.188
(indistinct chatter)

52:20.095 --> 52:21.095
Kathy:

52:21.096 --> 52:23.088
But I think what you're
saying is true, Doug.

52:23.140 --> 52:24.993
You don't really know people
when they work for you.

52:25.017 --> 52:26.119
- You don't.
- Jeana: Well, of course.

52:26.143 --> 52:27.463
I mean, everybody
kisses your ass.

52:27.519 --> 52:28.639
Everyone's nice to the boss.

52:28.729 --> 52:30.265
I actually think
you only know people

52:30.356 --> 52:32.097
when they do work for you.

52:32.107 --> 52:34.224
That's when you see
their ego, needs,

52:34.360 --> 52:37.353
insecurities,
authority issues.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.104
Yes, preach, totally.

52:39.198 --> 52:40.198
Doug:
It? a...

52:40.324 --> 52:41.690
Buenas noches.

52:44.370 --> 52:45.861
I thought you went to bed.

52:47.122 --> 52:50.490
I remember Kathy asked me
to sing a song after dinner.

52:50.918 --> 52:52.125
Oh, yeah,

52:52.127 --> 52:54.460
but that's not necessary
now, Beatriz.

52:55.130 --> 52:56.246
I feel I should.

52:56.590 --> 52:57.797
Well, we're just

52:57.925 --> 53:01.418
enjoying the stars and
the sounds of the night, so...

53:02.054 --> 53:03.795
I feel bad about
what happened earlier.

53:03.931 --> 53:05.172
I lost my manners.
I'm sorry.

53:05.265 --> 53:07.348
It happens.
Don't tear your hair out.

53:08.060 --> 53:09.801
Doug loses his manners
all the time.

53:09.937 --> 53:10.997
Don't give it two thoughts.

53:11.021 --> 53:13.013
Every time I go out with him
he embarrasses me.

53:13.107 --> 53:15.099
Oh, you're well compensated.

53:15.150 --> 53:17.437
See? He's rude.
He can't help it.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.819
Do you know
"Las Simples Cosas"?

53:21.782 --> 53:24.149
This song talks about how
we always wanna go back

53:24.159 --> 53:26.196
to the places where
we loved life.

53:26.995 --> 53:29.738
But the old, simple things
are now gone.

53:34.378 --> 53:37.166
(singing in Spanish)

55:28.200 --> 55:29.441
(clapping)

55:29.576 --> 55:30.737
That was very nice.

55:30.828 --> 55:32.740
- Very nice.
- Oh, that was lovely.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.742
- Muchas gracias
- De nada.

55:34.832 --> 55:35.868
Aye, Chihuahua.

55:35.999 --> 55:37.661
Okay, you're...
you're done.

55:37.793 --> 55:38.874
Sorry.

55:39.002 --> 55:42.211
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, it is so nice out here.

55:42.297 --> 55:43.663
<i>Kathy:
Oh, we feel so lucky.</i>

55:44.299 --> 55:45.652
Except we bought
at the height of the market.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.133
Other than that, we feel lucky.

55:47.594 --> 55:48.874
Well, you can't
take it with you.

55:48.929 --> 55:50.136
More wine?

55:50.222 --> 55:51.633
Oh, yes, please.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.264
Doug, you really
are famous.

55:58.605 --> 56:00.312
I was just searching you
on the Internet,

56:00.357 --> 56:01.723
and you're famous.

56:02.025 --> 56:03.516
Nah, famous?
I don't know. I'm known.

56:03.610 --> 56:05.317
You gave a great
TED talk, Doug.

56:05.320 --> 56:06.422
We watched that the other night.

56:06.446 --> 56:08.608
For a moment, I thought
you were a different man.

56:09.324 --> 56:11.737
A man that bought the land
in Tlatecuhtli.

56:12.327 --> 56:15.786
For a minute,
I freaked out, you know?

56:16.540 --> 56:20.033
Really, because I have to say,
if you had been that man...

56:21.336 --> 56:23.256
I would've thought that fate
brought us together.

56:23.630 --> 56:24.711
For what?

56:25.340 --> 56:27.582
I don't know.
Revenge, maybe?

56:28.635 --> 56:30.251
I should kill you
or something?

56:30.345 --> 56:31.961
(chuckles)

56:33.390 --> 56:35.052
But you're not that man.

56:35.559 --> 56:36.559
You're another man.

56:37.019 --> 56:38.510
Many men do what I do.

56:39.062 --> 56:40.724
One man, many men.

56:44.818 --> 56:46.480
So you believe in fate, huh?

56:46.862 --> 56:48.478
- Yes.
- So do I.

56:49.323 --> 56:54.159
I think we all have
a destiny to manifest.

56:54.828 --> 56:56.785
And if we don't,
it hurts the soul.

56:57.289 --> 56:59.201
<i>If the brass ring is there,
there's a reason.</i>

56:59.291 --> 57:00.907
And if we don't grab it, we...

57:01.043 --> 57:02.395
we regret it for the rest
of our lives.

57:02.419 --> 57:03.859
- I think that's right.
- Alex: Word.

57:04.212 --> 57:07.376
I always felt that my fate
was to heal people.

57:07.925 --> 57:09.507
And that's what
I've tried to do.

57:09.843 --> 57:12.506
<i>But there's so many sick people.</i>

57:13.055 --> 57:14.421
Every day more come.

57:15.223 --> 57:18.136
They have cancer,
they are dying.

57:18.393 --> 57:19.393
It's like a war

57:19.478 --> 57:23.392
<i>and I'm just a nurse
in the middle of a battlefield.</i>

57:24.316 --> 57:25.397
It's too much.

57:26.485 --> 57:27.485
I'm tired.

57:27.653 --> 57:30.066
But hasn't cancer gotten
more treatable?

57:30.197 --> 57:31.733
It has.
Just look at Tara.

57:31.823 --> 57:33.405
A good time to have cancer.

57:36.119 --> 57:39.157
Doug, you think killing
is hard, huh?

57:39.665 --> 57:41.281
You wait in the bushes,

57:41.375 --> 57:43.788
the animal might outrun you
or charge you.

57:44.252 --> 57:46.335
<i>It's not easy to get
your shot, hm?</i>

57:48.340 --> 57:50.172
Try healing something.

57:51.677 --> 57:52.838
That is hard.

57:54.137 --> 57:55.719
<i>That requires patience.</i>

57:56.431 --> 57:58.423
You can break something
in two seconds.

58:00.435 --> 58:02.848
But it can take forever
to fix it.

58:03.230 --> 58:05.267
A lifetime, generations.

58:06.233 --> 58:10.443
That's why we have to be careful
on this earth and gentle.

58:10.654 --> 58:12.987
Seems like you have
a pretty tough job.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.448
Yes, and there are
moments where I think...

58:16.994 --> 58:19.782
instead of trying to heal
all these people...

58:21.373 --> 58:24.912
it'd be better just to find
the source of all the suffering.

58:25.460 --> 58:27.076
Destroy the source,
you know?

58:27.170 --> 58:28.456
What's the source?

58:31.883 --> 58:33.069
What, you think
I'm the source?

58:33.093 --> 58:34.425
She doesn't think that.

58:34.469 --> 58:35.505
I think she does.

58:36.263 --> 58:37.504
You give me too much credit.

58:37.597 --> 58:38.678
What I think is

58:38.849 --> 58:41.592
all your pleasures are built
on other's pain.

58:41.685 --> 58:43.472
- Ah, that's bullshit.
- No.

58:43.729 --> 58:45.470
<i>Doug:
Look, I'm a big boy, okay?</i>

58:48.191 --> 58:49.477
Listen, honey.

58:51.028 --> 58:52.860
I think you have
a great depth of feeling

58:52.988 --> 58:54.820
that you project onto the world.

58:55.490 --> 58:58.233
But to be honest, the world
doesn't need your feelings.

58:58.368 --> 59:00.985
It needs jobs, it needs money,
it needs what I do.

59:01.121 --> 59:02.953
The world doesn't need you.
No.

59:03.498 --> 59:04.600
The world has more
than enough of you.

59:04.624 --> 59:06.081
Doug is a great philanthropist.

59:06.209 --> 59:07.290
Shut up, Kathy.

59:08.045 --> 59:09.502
There is another type of cancer

59:09.588 --> 59:11.545
that is killing
this earth, Doug.

59:12.883 --> 59:14.499
The world is dying.

59:14.509 --> 59:16.501
<i>You do see that.
Or are you blind?</i>

59:16.511 --> 59:17.989
<i>Jeana: The problem is there's
just too many people.</i>

59:18.013 --> 59:19.782
That's the problem, there's
just way too many people.

59:19.806 --> 59:22.514
You think that you can hide
up here behind these gates

59:22.517 --> 59:24.554
and that everything
is gonna be all right?

59:24.644 --> 59:26.476
No, it's coming for you.

59:26.521 --> 59:27.761
What the fuck is going on here?

59:27.814 --> 59:29.000
- Okay, that's enough.
- Mm-hm.

59:29.024 --> 59:30.515
It will touch you.

59:30.525 --> 59:31.982
You're done. Come on.

59:34.071 --> 59:36.108
(laughs)

59:39.034 --> 59:40.525
I don't think
she's a fan, Doug.

59:40.660 --> 59:42.822
I hope it will touch me
in my private parts.

59:42.954 --> 59:44.365
(laughing)

59:47.459 --> 59:49.451
What the fuck was that?
Huh?

59:50.170 --> 59:52.583
My relationship with that guy
paid for this house.

59:53.173 --> 59:54.505
What were you thinking?

59:55.509 --> 59:56.709
Why would you
do that to Kathy?

59:57.552 --> 59:59.635
She treats you like
her fucking friend.

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:03.764
I'm calling a tow truck.

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:05.411
They will tow you
back to Altadena.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.551
You're going tonight.

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:12.390
Jesus.

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:15.902
Don't ruin it by being
a weird drunk, okay?

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:18.813
Stop it.

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:22.446
I mean, it's not like
we're beheading people

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.903
or blowing up babies.
It's so awkward.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.449
<i>Grant:
Well, that was different.</i>

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.780
I'm sorry about that, everyone.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:29.498
- What happened?
- She's going home

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:30.904
- don't worry about it.
- But how?

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:32.285
I took care of it, okay?

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.581
Okay-

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.384
(speaking Spanish)

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:53.893
Bien, muchas gracias.

You're leaving?

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:40.190
Yes.

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:43.105
I think it's best.

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.321
I wanted to give you
some money.

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.664
Just take it.
It's gonna be so expensive

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.665
for you to get your car
towed back to Altadena.

01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:55.159
I don't want your money.

01:01:58.465 --> 01:01:59.797
Well, I don't know.

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:02.709
I kind of feel like
I don't even know you.

You don't know me.

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:11.141
Well, I'm sorry this happened.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.397
I'm gonna go back.

- That whole thing's a candle?
- Yeah.

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:36.812
Now just let it get
a little hot.

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:38.147
<i>I think you got
to light up first.</i>

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.412
Oh, my God, Grant.

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:40.913
You know he's a pyromaniac.

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:43.715
Every time I turn around,
he's lighting something on fire.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.071
<i>- You wanna flip it?
- Yeah, let's flip it over.</i>

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:46.427
Okay. Here we go.

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:48.383
Okay. There we go.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.552
This is Cal.
He's got that deposition.

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:51.723
I'm gonna take this
in the house.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:52.726
Okay-

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.726
- What, we just hold it?
- Grant: Yeah.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.353
Jeana, would you like
to let it go?

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:57.975
Oh, okay.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.315
Will you hold that?

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:02.522
Now, make a wish
because it's a wishing lantern.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.729
Okay. If I set
everything on fire,

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:05.855
will it still come true?

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.732
Oh, I know.
Should we be doing this?

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:09.738
Yeah, technically
it's not a firework.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.527
Well, if you burn
down the canyon,

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.701
you're still going to jail.

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:14.158
Alex is a lawyer.
He'll get you off.

01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:15.831
Well, we would have had
so much fun.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:17.871
I got you, man.
You're good.

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:20.587
- Okay.
- All right.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:22.083
Let go.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.877
- Jeana: Whee!
- Grant: Oh.

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.751
- Alex: Oh.
- Grant: See that?

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:28.093
(all laugh)

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:30.258
That is beautiful.

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.972
<i>Kathy:
Isn't it amazing?</i>

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:33.799
<i>Grant:
Look at that.</i>

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:12.221
Doug: I think you should have
given all your emails to her.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.000
<i>Yeah, all-
all your correspondence.</i>

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:16.801
<i>Yes.</i>

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:18.611
Because she's most likely
gonna enter them all

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.600
as evidence anyway

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:21.876
and he needs to know
what he's up against.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.812
<i>He's your lawyer.
He's working for you.</i>

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:25.498
<i>You should have done this
eight months ago.</i>

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:27.569
<i>okay-</i>

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.818
<i>Okay, talk to him
and then just call me back.</i>

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:31.906
I'm...

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:35.619
still at this dinner,
so make it fast.

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.698
Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.347
No "good nights"?

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:16.870
(chuckles)

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.867
How many years till
we're both dead?

01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:25.870
Twenty years, thirty years?

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:29.256
We're dying.

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:32.752
Humans are dying.
The elephants are dying.

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:34.219
Bees are dying.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.175
The world is dying.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:38.557
What are you gonna do?

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:42.061
Accept it
and enjoy yourself.

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:45.313
You should try
to enjoy yourself.

01:05:46.818 --> 01:05:48.901
It's not all so sad, is it?

01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:55.774
I know I know you.

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.371
<i>(car approaching)</i>

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:19.806
<i>(door closes)</i>

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:42.435
<i>Tow truck driver:
You have everything?</i>

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:47.960
You ready?

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.596
(door closes)

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:14.524

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:19.324
<i>(door shuts)</i>

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:20.994
Wait.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:23.532
I forgot one thing.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:26.208
<i>(door closes)</i>

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:50.490
Let's do it in the morning.
I got to get home.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.433
I'm tired and I got...

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:54.519
(groans)

01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:56.236
Gad!

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:57.938
Fuck!

01:07:58.032 --> 01:07:59.443
(grunting)

01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:04.073

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.280
(grunts)

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.206
All tears flow
from the same source.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:45.702
What happened?

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:48.154
Doug? Doug?
Doug!

01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:51.082
- Oh, my God, Doug?
- Oh, my God!

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:53.577
- Grant!
- Grant: Yeah?

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:56.080
<i>(Jeana crying)
Oh. my God!</i>

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.712
- Beatriz, what happened?
- Jeana: What did you do?

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.678
(Jeana crying)

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:07.966
<i>Kathy:
Why? Why?</i>

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.514
Beatriz, what happened?

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.145
<i>(voices fade)</i>

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:29.621
Doug: No, let's do it
in the morning.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.116
<i>I'm tired and I've got
other shit going on.</i>

01:09:32.794 --> 01:09:33.794

Driver:
You okay?

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.645
That man killed my goat.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.204
Pull over.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.172
What?

01:11:03.217 --> 01:11:04.799
Pull over, please,
right there.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.842
Driver:
Where are you going?

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:52.631
Lady?

01:12:14.705 --> 01:12:16.446
Can someone help me hold this?

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.282
Let them go at the same time
and make a wish.

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:20.033
Everybody on three.
One...

01:12:20.127 --> 01:12:21.288
- Alex?
- What?

01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:23.065
We're supposed to let them go
at the same time.

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:24.330
Alex:
Sorry.
