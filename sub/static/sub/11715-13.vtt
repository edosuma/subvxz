00:01.961 --> 00:03.629
Hey.
Hey.

00:03.671 --> 00:07.215
Hey.
Jeff, guess what
I just bought.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.843
Something overpriced
that we don't need.

00:11.595 --> 00:12.847
Two tickets to Bon Jovi.

00:13.305 --> 00:14.222
(SIGHS)

00:17.058 --> 00:18.268
Why would you buy those?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.563
Come on, you know
I've always liked Bon J.

00:21.605 --> 00:22.857
Let's go out,
get a little crazy.

00:23.941 --> 00:26.193
I don't know,
it's crowded and loud

00:27.277 --> 00:28.779
and when you get there
it's Bon Jovi.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.826
All right, grandpa.

00:36.077 --> 00:39.080
Plus beers are like $11,
so there's another 88 bucks.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.377
Well, I've heard
Bon Jovi's great live.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.336
You see?

00:45.420 --> 00:48.549
Yeah, my mom sees him
all the time.

00:48.590 --> 00:52.219
Except for last year
when she had hip surger.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.179
I think that's the first
time in a while that

00:54.221 --> 00:55.806
Bon Jovi and hip
were mentioned together.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.185
Wait, so... So what
are you saying?

01:00.227 --> 01:01.269
I'm like your mom?

01:02.187 --> 01:03.814
Oh, no,
I didn't mean that.

01:03.856 --> 01:06.274
I mean, I do think
you'll be a great mom.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.443
What does that mean?

01:08.485 --> 01:10.111
It's just that I think u
have a lot of experience

01:11.238 --> 01:13.866
and that you always
know what to say.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.116
You don't.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.915
So... So what, I'm like
some wise old woman?

01:22.123 --> 01:23.751
Yeah, yeah, I think
that's what she meant.

01:26.045 --> 01:27.337
I think it's pretty cler
what's going on here.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.381
Jen is dying
to see Bon Jovi.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.632
As a gentleman, I'm goig
to let her buy my ticke.

01:30.674 --> 01:31.550
Face value.

01:32.300 --> 01:32.968
What?

01:33.928 --> 01:35.387
Jump on it.
It's a great deal.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.933
Fine, I'll have a much
better time with her.
What do you say?

01:38.974 --> 01:40.350
Um, sure, yeah,
sounds like fun.

01:41.894 --> 01:44.229
No, fun is not the word
to describe
a Bon Jovi concert.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.355
Oh, on this we agree.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.483
Hey.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.195
Timmy, I see you had
your boss reupholstered.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.743
Look, it's not in
the normal rotaish,

01:57.785 --> 01:59.286
but to shake up
me recent funk,

02:00.245 --> 02:01.705
pulled this
out of the closet.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.207
I think it pulled you
out of the closet.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.003
Yeah.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.422
I wonder how long this
stuff's been in here.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.339
Let me see.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.469
A ticket stub to Sisterd
of the Traveling Pants?

02:18.055 --> 02:19.807
Hey, spoiler alert.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.558
The pants never travel
south of the waist.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.605
Well, here's a phone number.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.523
That's weird.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.483
That you scored a number
wrapped in pleather?

02:29.524 --> 02:30.776
That is weird.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.778
No, there's no name.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.657
Well, I don't recognizet
as one of your clinics
or escort services.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.243
Yeah, that would
be programmed in.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.497
No, this has got to be
some chick's number.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.040
Call it up,
see who answers.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.793
I don't know.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.212
Isn't it kind of disresl
to call after all this ?

02:51.254 --> 02:52.673
Plus, she might be a ho.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.301
Here, find out who
this chick is.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.930
Oh, let her go, sir.
She got away
fair and square.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.143
True, but she made the miste
of leaving a paper trai.

03:04.852 --> 03:05.727
(CHUCKLES)
(SIGHS)

03:05.769 --> 03:06.436
Now, go.

03:07.896 --> 03:11.025
And as a reward
you get a, uh,
invite to a Y2K party.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.239
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

03:21.702 --> 03:24.079
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not sc?

03:26.247 --> 03:30.127
♪ With you by my side
There is no denying

03:31.170 --> 03:33.172
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

03:42.764 --> 03:44.725
So, now that Jen
and Audrey are gone,

03:44.766 --> 03:45.934
we can do whatever we want.

03:46.685 --> 03:47.811
Oh, they left you two?

03:49.104 --> 03:50.772
That's good.
They were both
kinda lame, dude.

03:52.191 --> 03:53.608
Honestly, you're better.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.695
They just went to
a concert together.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.779
Oh, well,
they're great gals.

03:57.821 --> 04:02.117
You guys are lucky.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.285
All right, so what's
the plan for tonight?

04:04.327 --> 04:06.788
Barbecue on the roof.
I've got a 36-ounce sir.

04:06.830 --> 04:07.789
Mmm-hmm.
...a couple of baked ta.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.208
Yes.
12 pack of brewskies.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.001
That sounds fantastic.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.420
It will be.
What are you gonna do?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.928
(STAMMERING) Oh, I thought
that I was included
in your thing.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.931
Now that you know you're no,
what are you gonna do?

04:24.639 --> 04:26.100
Come on, deal me in.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.103
I can rock a mean salad.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.313
I will never find out
if that's true.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.274
Hey.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.902
Sir, I've found
your mystery woman.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.572
Oh, nice detective work,
Angela Lamesbury.

04:42.699 --> 04:43.951
Spill the beans.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.370
The number once belonged to
a Meredith Carroll, now.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.081
She's a podiatrist.

04:49.706 --> 04:50.749
Oh, I love kids.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.547
You, uh, you're thinking
of a pediatrician.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.093
Swing and a miss,
mind reader.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.934
Hey, how's she looking?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.518
Hot enough to take a rie
in the old Russ Bus?

05:11.061 --> 05:11.979
(MIMICS BUS)

05:18.359 --> 05:20.821
Yes, with stops
at Regret-ville,
Shame-town, and STD Cit.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.617
But, no, I don't know
what she looks like.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.910
Her website
didn't have a photo.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.121
Aw, always doing
half the job.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.291
Let's be clear.
None of this is my job.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.836
All right, make
an appointment
to see her.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.378
See if she's hot enough
for me to pursue.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.090
Okay, first off,
there's nothing wrong
with my feet.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.633
(STOMPS TIMMY'S FOOT)

05:41.675 --> 05:43.927
(STIFLES CRY)
Yeah. That sounded painful.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.054
You might want to
get that looked at.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.931
(HIGH-PITCHED)
Uh-huh.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.933
Go, go, go,
hop out on the good one.

05:49.975 --> 05:50.767
There you go.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.397
All right, let me
take a look at this.
Does this hurt?

05:56.439 --> 05:57.524
(HIGH-PITCHED GIGGLE)

05:59.818 --> 06:01.195
I'll take that as a no.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.988
Um, you know, Dr. Carro.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.364
I told you,
call me Meredith.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.659
Of course, um,
you know, Meredith,

06:07.701 --> 06:09.536
it is rather impressive
that you have

06:09.577 --> 06:11.330
your own practice
at such a young age.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.873
Oh, well, this is
my father's practice,

06:12.914 --> 06:14.124
and I took it over
when he passed away.

06:14.166 --> 06:14.958
(GIGGLES)

06:18.337 --> 06:19.671
I'm so sorry,
that's the tickle talki.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.631
Yeah, I assumed.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.925
So what do you do?

06:23.967 --> 06:25.219
Isn't it obvious?

06:25.260 --> 06:26.178
I'm a foot model.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.682
Although I do have
grand ambitions of

06:30.724 --> 06:35.562
transitioning into
being a foot actor.

06:35.603 --> 06:42.319
All right, well, you can
put your shoes back on.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.946
Actually, I, uh,
work in real estate
development for a, uh...

06:47.657 --> 06:51.536
You know, it's not
important who I work fo.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.997
Well, there doesn't seem toe
any problem with your f.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.957
Except that they'll be
carrying me out of here.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.209
(LAUGHS)

06:59.086 --> 07:01.796
Well, you can always mae
a follow-up appointment
with my receptionist.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.091
Ah, perhaps, uh,
we could do a follow-up
over dinner tonight.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.675
(LAUGHS)

07:07.302 --> 07:09.263
Well, I... I am tempted,
but I generally
don't date patients.

07:09.971 --> 07:10.680
Ah.

07:12.391 --> 07:15.977
Well, in that case,
you're fired.

07:16.019 --> 07:22.109
Well, in that case,
pick me up at 7:00.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.151
(KNOCKS AT DOOR)

07:24.194 --> 07:24.903
Hey.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.864
Uh, Audrey is still
getting ready.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.574
Oh, okay.
Yeah, but come on in and wa.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.992
I gotta go take care
of my meat.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.496
Do you really have
to announce that?

07:35.538 --> 07:36.623
I'm marinating my steak.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.377
But now that you mentio,
I should wash my hands.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.215
Oh, hey.
Hey, Jeff, have you seen
my red leather jacket?

07:46.049 --> 07:47.426
Wow, look at that outfi.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.053
I remember this party g.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.638
Mmm-hmm.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.183
She was up for it a lote
than the one I've got n.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.020
Yeah, that was before
you formally announced

07:59.062 --> 08:02.149
your decision
to let yourself go.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.358
Have you seen
my butter spray?

08:04.901 --> 08:06.111
It's on your nightstand.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.155
Gross.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.911
It's not what you think.
I was eating an ear
of corn in there.

08:14.953 --> 08:18.665
All right, whatever
you wanna call it.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.209
Look, for some reason
Adam looks up to you.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.128
It would have been nice
if you had included him
in your barbecue.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.629
Well, 20/20 hindsight.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.342
You realize you
still can invite him.

into downward dog.

I appreciate the offer,
but no thanks.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.197
What the hell
are you doing?

08:50.238 --> 08:51.406
Well, it's such
a nice night,

08:52.532 --> 08:55.118
I thought I'd do
a little sunset yoga.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.619
You knew I was using
the roof to grill.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.373
Oh, was that tonight?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.459
I get it,
you feel left out.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.627
You made your point.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.463
Let me have the roof
to myself,

09:06.505 --> 09:08.173
and tomorrow,
I'll let you make me
that salad.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.011
Sorry, buddy,
but I'm here to stay.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.723
So, I guess you're just gona
have to make other plan.

09:18.599 --> 09:21.269
Actually,
I don't think I will.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.149

isn't gonna bother me.

isn't gonna bother me.

I'm talking about!

09:45.460 --> 09:46.086

running all over the fl.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.196
I sprung for
the clear-coat sealant.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.576
I don't even use
a towel anymore.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.747
You're a very
impressive man, sir.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.791
So what's the deal
with foot girl?

10:24.832 --> 10:26.501
Oh, you wouldn't
be interested, sir.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.003
She's beneath you.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.381
Oh, I'd be very interesd
in her beneath me, actu.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.716
Sir, what I meant was

10:34.717 --> 10:36.636
she's far below
your standards.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.472
You needn't give her
another moment's though.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.889
Oh, yeah, that bad, huh?

10:39.931 --> 10:41.015
Mmm.
What is she, a dog?

10:41.600 --> 10:42.850
A hog? A cow?

10:45.520 --> 10:47.481
All of the above, sir.

10:47.522 --> 10:48.689
Sounds like a mess.
Might be good for you, thou.

10:48.731 --> 10:49.483
Hmm.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.028
I'll take that under
advisement, shall I?

10:54.070 --> 10:55.989
Now, if you've no more
degrading errands for m,

10:57.365 --> 10:59.659
I have some plans.
I was hoping
to cut out early.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.329
Whoa, after I gave you
half a day off
for the foot thing?

an inch, huh?

11:19.346 --> 11:20.054
Okay.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.307
Okay, Jeff,
that's enough.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.392
Look, it's fine,
you know,

11:26.060 --> 11:28.104
if you want to,
uh, just lie there,
grinding away at that mt

11:28.146 --> 11:29.314
like it's Justin Timber.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.318
But I'm gonna
keep grilling.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.777
I already turned
the music off for you.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.237
No, you didn't.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.739
The boombox ate your tape.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.033
Look, I was here first.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.119
(MOCKING)
I was here first.
What are you, nine?

11:43.161 --> 11:44.787
Besides, I had dibs.

11:45.913 --> 11:46.998
Sorry, I'm staying.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.876
Look, we both know
how this is gonna end.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.753
I'm the big dog.

11:52.795 --> 11:56.007
So let's just
cut to the part
where I get my way.

11:56.049 --> 11:56.799
Fine.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.218
Great.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.346
I'll even
give you a beverage
for the walk down.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.475
I think I accidentally
threw one of Aud's
wine coolers in here.

12:06.601 --> 12:07.477
Here we go.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.940
How you like me now,
big dog?

12:20.907 --> 12:24.785
One false move and
you can say goodbye
to your sirloin.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.454
Hey, look, this is
between you and me.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.499
Don't take it out
on the meat.

12:29.541 --> 12:30.749
I mean, let's just
talk this out.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.335
No, I'm done talking.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.420
Okay, we're supposed
to be friends,

12:33.461 --> 12:35.004
but you don't invite me
to hang out.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.839
It's like...

12:36.881 --> 12:39.509
It's like you
don't respect me.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.844
You are wearing
those tiny pants.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.137
They're yoga pants.

12:43.804 --> 12:44.847
And they're Jen's.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.808
All right, fine.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.352
From now on,
I do respect you.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.897
How do I know
you're not just
saying that?

12:52.939 --> 12:56.150
You do know
that I'm just
saying that.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.110
Okay one more step...

12:58.570 --> 13:00.905
One more step,
and you can say
goodbye to your meat.

13:00.947 --> 13:01.948
All right, fine.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.118
Just know that two
can play this game.
(UNZIPPING)

13:05.159 --> 13:06.745
What are you doing?

13:06.785 --> 13:09.706
Taking a hostage of my own.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.916
You return
my steak to safety,

13:11.958 --> 13:15.503
or I'm gonna whiz
all over your yoga mat.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.464
You're bluffing.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.173
I've had three beers
and a wine cooler.

13:19.215 --> 13:26.723
I couldn't bluff
if I wanted to.

13:26.765 --> 13:27.641
(ALL CHEER)

13:29.100 --> 13:31.645
Yes! Ah, I never
sit this close!

13:33.812 --> 13:36.483
When Jeff buys tickets
he calls the back row
the front row to saving.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.902
They certainly play
a lot of songs
that sound similar.

13:39.944 --> 13:40.861
(SIGHS)

13:41.571 --> 13:42.989
What are you doing?

13:43.030 --> 13:44.699
You can't rock
sitting down.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.367
Come on, Audrey,
don't your feet hurt?

13:46.409 --> 13:47.160
No way.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.204
Your straps
are digging in.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.206
I can see you bleeding.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.709
Jen, this is
Bon Jovi, okay?

13:54.751 --> 13:57.378
He has seen a million faces,
and he has rocked them .

13:57.420 --> 13:58.212
Yours is not gonna be
the first face
he doesn't rock.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.046
Come on.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.840
Okay, you're right.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.050
Just let me go
check in with Adam,

14:03.092 --> 14:04.427
then I'll let him
rock my face.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.720
All right, hurry back.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.138
Oh, my God.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.222
Ah!

14:11.267 --> 14:12.977
Hey, honey,
I'm gonna be home a lite
later than I thought.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.646
What's up with you?

14:14.688 --> 14:16.189
Actually,
I'm up on the roof.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.066
Oh, good, so you're
hanging out with Jeff?

14:20.276 --> 14:21.736
Well, he's doing most
of the hanging out.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.704
I love this restaurant.
Have you been here before?

14:30.745 --> 14:32.372
Yes, I come here
all the time.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.456
Mmm, I really like
the decor.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.332
Mmm-hmm.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.377
I really do think
the library motif
gives it...

14:37.418 --> 14:40.380
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

14:43.508 --> 14:44.925
What on earth
are you doing here?

14:44.967 --> 14:46.386
Oh, I put
the pieces together.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.598
Timmy, what's going on?

14:50.640 --> 14:52.016
RUSSELL: I'll tell you
what's going on.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.352
I sent him to
see if you were
hot enough for me.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.562
Congratulations,
you are.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.232
But then he lied
and grabbed you
for himself.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.276
Do you
know this person?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.111
Yes. Um, Mr. Dunbar,
can we please discuss
this in private?

15:05.363 --> 15:07.031
There's nothing
to discuss.
She's my date.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.449
We have a long
history together

15:08.491 --> 15:11.536
and I'd like to
try to remember it.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.829
I don't know
who you are.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.205
Quiet.
This doesn't
concern you!

15:18.000 --> 15:20.127
Sir, why would I facilie
you dating this lovely woman

15:20.169 --> 15:22.046
when all you do
is try to score with her

15:22.088 --> 15:23.381
and then spend
the next few weeks
dodging her calls?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.382
(LAUGHING)
Okay.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.761
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

15:27.802 --> 15:31.264
When we do it,
I'll take your call.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.181
Now scooch.

15:33.892 --> 15:34.726
I will not.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.938
Unlike you, I have an al
connection with Meredit.

15:38.979 --> 15:43.317
Oh, is that why you
refer to her as a dog,
hog, and a cow?

15:45.194 --> 15:46.654
TIMMY:
What... No, no.

15:46.696 --> 15:47.864
Those were your words.

15:49.699 --> 15:53.160
I merely agreed to
throw him off your scen.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.454
I'm an animal
with a scent?

15:55.162 --> 15:56.247
Ooh, yeah, you are.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.751
Listen, I think
you should leave.

15:59.793 --> 16:00.919
You're making Maryanne
very uncomfortable.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.128
Meredith.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.671
Of course it is.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.674
So where are you
from, Meredith?

16:06.716 --> 16:11.930
Can we get some bread?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.431
MAN: Thank you.
Good night!

16:13.473 --> 16:15.224
Oh, what a show!

16:18.311 --> 16:20.354
Wow, band's aged
a lot better than
some of their fans.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.231
(YAWNING)

16:23.023 --> 16:24.150
You tired?
No. Mmm-mmm.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.361
'Cause you were yawning.
No, I...

16:27.403 --> 16:28.988
That wasn't a yawn.
I was cheering.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.156
(YAWNING CHEER)
Bon Jovi!

16:31.616 --> 16:32.867
Well, tired or not,
show's over.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.161
We get to go home!

16:35.202 --> 16:36.913
Get to? What...
Maybe you wanna
go home.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.958
Not maybe.
I do.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.460
Well, sorry, this night
is far from over.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.921
Oh, God, tell me the bas
not coming back on.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.840
No, grandma.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.341
We are gonna go backstage
and party with them.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.926
Why are you calling everyone
your grandparent?

16:49.968 --> 16:51.260
Come on, come on,
let's go.

16:51.886 --> 16:56.349
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.435
You know there's
a clock on this.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.437
And with each beer,
I'm losing my ability
to negotiate.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.485
We'll just see what
gives out first.
My arm or your bladder.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.238
And I don't need medican
to control my arm.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.494
You know,
you're really showing me
some stones tonight.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.244
Yeah.

17:19.205 --> 17:23.334
I'm getting
a pretty good look
at yours, too.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.462
I admire how you're
standing up to me.

17:26.504 --> 17:27.797
You've earned my respec.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.340
Seriously?
Yep.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.178
How do I know you're
not just saying that?

17:34.220 --> 17:37.015
Because I'm not.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.142
And I mean it. And if yu
still want it, a quarter
of that steak is yours.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.227
Thanks, man.

17:41.644 --> 17:42.353
I do.

17:43.270 --> 17:44.063
Ah! Oh!

17:45.272 --> 17:45.940
No!

17:47.775 --> 17:48.484
(SIGHS)

17:50.987 --> 17:52.572
Well, I guess we both
know what this means.

17:54.824 --> 17:55.616
Go ahead.

17:57.035 --> 17:57.952
(SIGHS)

18:09.213 --> 18:11.298
I knew it was fate
that you and I
would end up together.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.307
You couldn't let me have
just one small victory,
could you?

18:22.685 --> 18:24.353
You're right, Timmy.
This is for the best.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.733
If she didn't want
either one of us,
then who needs her?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.569
Actually, she did
want one of us.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.653
Me, she wanted me.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.282
Yeah, who needs her?

18:38.618 --> 18:39.368
Hmm?

18:47.668 --> 18:49.837
All right,
just leave it
to me, okay?

18:49.879 --> 18:51.380
I know how to sweet talk
my way into the VIP.

18:51.422 --> 18:52.715
I believe you, Audrey.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.718
Please, just let me
go home.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.471
Hey, great show, huh?

18:58.512 --> 19:00.431
Whoa, did you get to lin
or were you at the gym?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.390
(GRUNTS)

19:02.516 --> 19:05.019
Nobody gets backstage
without a pass.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.520
Yeah, I've been
a lifelong Bon Jovi fan.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.398
I've seen him,
like, 10 times.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.150
I've always really
wanted to meet him.
You think...

19:11.191 --> 19:11.901
Sorry.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.701
Okay, look,
I'm about to be
a mom, okay?

19:20.743 --> 19:22.536
I see how kids affect
my friends' lives.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.872
How many more chances
am I gonna have
to get crazy?

19:24.914 --> 19:26.874
Come on,
let me have this,
please? Please?

19:27.750 --> 19:28.793
You know,
I wish I could.

19:29.293 --> 19:32.880
And I can.

19:32.922 --> 19:44.684
Hmm, I still got it.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.727
Wow, so you guys
got to party
with Bon Jovi backstage?

19:48.813 --> 19:51.231
Well, if you call
watching them quietly
playing backgammon

19:51.273 --> 19:52.900
so as not to wake
their kids "partying"...

19:55.736 --> 19:57.655
What did I say, huh?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.532
What happens backstage
stays backstage.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.577
Got it.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.454
I mean, why did that
bouncer keep thanking you?

20:05.496 --> 20:08.124
Uh, I don't know.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.292
That's so weird.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.711
So did you guys
have fun together?

20:13.379 --> 20:14.254
Yeah, yeah.

20:15.173 --> 20:16.590
Some yoga,
a little grilling.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.466
Good times.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.761
JENNIFER:
Oh. Oh, so that's where
the yoga mat is.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.138
We need to return it
to Audrey.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.229
That, uh, the...
The, uh, yoga mat is,
uh, Audrey's?

20:36.110 --> 20:37.070
How about that?

20:40.114 --> 20:42.033
Oh, you didn't sweat
all over it, did you?

20:44.284 --> 20:45.161
I did not.
