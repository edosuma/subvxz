Unh, check, check it, yeah

00:28.220 --> 00:30.560
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:30.630 --> 00:31.990
Make the homies say "ho!"

00:32.060 --> 00:34.030
Make the girlies want to
scream

00:34.100 --> 00:36.030
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:36.100 --> 00:39.560
Make the homies say "ho!"
and the girlies want to scream

00:39.640 --> 00:41.690
Aqua Teen Hunger Force

00:41.770 --> 00:43.670
Number one in the hood, "G"!

00:43.740 --> 00:45.670
So, very roomy over here.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.070
You know, you got the vaulted...

00:47.140 --> 00:48.410
Well, it's not vaulted ceiling,

00:48.480 --> 00:51.380
but, uh, you could do that if
you wanted to... you know,

00:51.450 --> 00:54.420
put your flat-screen TV there if
you can afford one of them.

00:54.480 --> 00:55.640
Uh, you know, l can.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.690
So, uh, you know,
don't judge me.

00:58.650 --> 01:00.210
But, uh, bars on the windows,

01:00.290 --> 01:04.250
'cause, you know, we get so much
homeless traffic through here.

01:04.330 --> 01:06.230
They'll see that plasma screen,
and they'll...

01:06.300 --> 01:08.790
they'll break down a wall like a
bunch of zombies.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.130
And, uh, don't never go
into the attic.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.930
l just nailed that door shut.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.900
Uh, you don't want to see what's
up there.

01:14.970 --> 01:16.770
Hey, you got kids?

01:16.840 --> 01:18.200
lf l'm married to her...

01:19.610 --> 01:21.040
We'd be popping them out!

01:21.110 --> 01:22.080
We got two monkeys.

01:22.140 --> 01:23.810
Yeah, that might be a
problem here.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.040
See, uh, they ain't got no
bathroom here,

01:26.120 --> 01:28.020
but they got a hole
in the plywood.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.140
lt goes all the way down to the
crawl space,

01:30.220 --> 01:31.780
and there's plenty
of room down there.

01:31.850 --> 01:33.620
Uh, they...
they got this old pizza

01:33.690 --> 01:35.990
there to block off the aroma.

01:36.060 --> 01:37.490
Your wife's pretty hot, man.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.030
How much do you make a year?

01:39.100 --> 01:40.360
You have some manners.

01:40.430 --> 01:41.920
Who lived here before?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.090
Uh, just some residents,
you know.

01:45.170 --> 01:47.160
l'm not talking about them.

01:47.240 --> 01:52.330
And over here, my dear, you can
undress right here on this "X."

01:52.410 --> 01:56.070
You know, don't, you know,
got to be on that spot.

01:56.150 --> 01:59.550
Uh, and, you know,
you got to do it there.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.710
So, when can we plan on you
moving in?

02:01.780 --> 02:03.880
Look, we really need to
discuss this.

02:03.950 --> 02:06.080
No, l understand.
l understand.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.120
Take your time.
Take your time.

02:08.190 --> 02:11.890
l need an answer in the next
5 minutes, but take your time.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.930
l don't really feel safe here.

02:15.000 --> 02:15.960
l think it's perfect.

02:16.030 --> 02:17.160
You think it's perfect?

02:17.230 --> 02:18.220
l think it's perfecter!

02:18.300 --> 02:19.890
Check out that hole
in the floor!

02:19.970 --> 02:21.030
lt's so old world.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.070
Did you know pooping standing
up is chic?

02:23.140 --> 02:24.070
Get a hold of yourself.

02:24.140 --> 02:25.230
We're ready to make an offer.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.570
lt smells like hot garbage pizza.

02:27.640 --> 02:31.810
Let's just pay the asking price...
cash.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.440
That... is really smart.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.640
Carl, we love this house.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.310
Both:
Aah!

02:39.290 --> 02:40.280
We love the house.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.290
We keep passing the sign
from Quadrant 9.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.190
This is perfect.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.060
lt suits our every need, want,
and desire.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.360
How much is the house?

02:46.430 --> 02:47.920
Please say a very low number.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.830
Uh.

02:48.900 --> 02:51.990
Hey, kids, check it out...
pizza.

02:52.070 --> 02:53.800
Hey, there's pizza in here!

02:53.870 --> 02:55.430
l'm not saying it twice!

02:55.500 --> 02:57.600
All of you, now!

02:57.670 --> 02:59.200
Pizza!
Pizza!

02:59.280 --> 03:00.110
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

03:00.180 --> 03:03.040
Yes, pizza,
blocking the aroma chamber.

03:03.110 --> 03:04.200
Unleash the mighty odor!

03:04.280 --> 03:05.340
Hang on! Hang on!

03:05.410 --> 03:06.470
Hang on a second!

03:06.550 --> 03:09.450
We got a very high selling price
on this, so, uh, you know,

03:09.520 --> 03:11.420
l don't know that
you can afford it.

03:11.490 --> 03:14.150
Yeah, we have nothing,
and you're gonna like it.

03:14.220 --> 03:15.420
Well, uh, like this...

03:15.490 --> 03:16.320
it ain't got no bathroom.

03:16.390 --> 03:18.550
We have no need for bathrooms.

03:18.630 --> 03:21.430
The universe is our bathroom.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.900
The universe is my bathroom.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.400
We deposit oil into the
atmosphere when we get nervous...

03:25.470 --> 03:27.200
standard robot protocol.

03:27.270 --> 03:28.460
Well, look, l mean,

03:28.540 --> 03:30.270
rooms are pretty tight,
you know?

03:30.340 --> 03:33.140
l mean, you got all them
screaming robots to keep, um...

03:33.210 --> 03:34.800
are they multiplying over there?

03:34.880 --> 03:37.000
Yeah! Yeah!
Hey, yeah!

03:37.080 --> 03:39.270
Hey, you don't worry about us.

03:39.350 --> 03:40.540
We have no need for space.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.740
All right, well, uh, gas.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.840
That's right...
gas leaking in the house.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.860
Gas is our favorite flavor.

03:47.920 --> 03:48.860
Yeah, that works for us.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.410
Yeah, gas is an aphrodisiac
for us.

03:50.490 --> 03:52.220
lt turns us on sexually.

03:52.290 --> 03:53.350
Yay, da!

03:53.430 --> 03:54.690
Yeah, this is a match.

03:54.760 --> 03:55.700
This works for us.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.820
Well, you know...

03:57.900 --> 04:01.630
two people were murdered here.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.330
Yeah, we killed them.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.430
Well, yeah, l mean,

04:04.510 --> 04:06.170
they might try to haunt your house,
you know?

04:06.240 --> 04:07.070
You don't know that.

04:07.140 --> 04:07.970
Nonsense!

04:08.040 --> 04:09.340
Everything's perfect!

04:09.410 --> 04:10.970
We live here now!

04:11.050 --> 04:12.670
Yay!

04:12.750 --> 04:13.740
Who are you?

04:13.820 --> 04:15.940
Well, l'm the, uh,
l'm the realtor.

04:16.019 --> 04:18.820
And, uh, l got to say,
l'm putting my foot down.

04:18.890 --> 04:22.550
l need proof of,
uh... you know,

04:22.630 --> 04:23.590
you got a job, man?

04:23.660 --> 04:25.180
l have no credit, no savings,

04:25.260 --> 04:26.730
and l'm between opportunities.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.160
But l must warn you...
he is lazy.

04:29.230 --> 04:31.360
Extremely lazy.

04:31.430 --> 04:34.130
Then l think we're
gonna have us a little problem.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.870
Okay, l got to go.

04:36.940 --> 04:37.800
Carl.

04:37.870 --> 04:39.930
Oh. Oh, hey, Marcus.

04:40.010 --> 04:41.000
Marcula.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.440
Stop trying to sell my house.

04:43.510 --> 04:45.280
Okay, no.

04:45.350 --> 04:48.410
l-l was just showing this group
of machines all the...

04:48.480 --> 04:49.310
all the features.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.820
Did you show them
the gas leak?

04:51.890 --> 04:54.620
Yeah, no, l-l pointed
that out first,

04:54.690 --> 04:55.950
and they're all over it.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.860
And l love robots.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.760
Sold to this group of machines.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.490
Yay!
Yes!

05:02.560 --> 05:03.930
l need this door taken down.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.190
The floor... don't need it.

05:05.270 --> 05:07.330
End of tomorrow,
this wall will be down.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.270
Knock it down.

05:08.340 --> 05:10.200
This leave...
l like this one.

05:10.270 --> 05:11.740
Move this over an inch.

05:11.810 --> 05:12.900
No, not move...
just gone.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.440
Gone.

05:14.510 --> 05:16.030
Carl, have you seen the
deadbeats around...

05:16.110 --> 05:19.170
You know, the food?

05:19.250 --> 05:21.080
No, they left in the
middle of the night.

05:21.150 --> 05:24.520
Because l had demons drag
them off into the night.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.560
l'm not going to fix a gas leak
for them.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.350
Now, at this very moment,

05:29.430 --> 05:31.860
they are being cocooned by
military spiders

05:31.930 --> 05:34.660
in a cave in the
Mojave Desert.

05:34.730 --> 05:38.060
That's what l do to a-holes.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.360
But not to you.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.530
l would never do that to you.

05:42.600 --> 05:48.040
You are welcome to live here
forever and ever.

05:48.110 --> 05:50.370
Now... feast!

05:50.450 --> 05:51.470
Feast on what, man?

05:52.450 --> 05:54.350
lnvisible robot meat...
my favorite!

05:54.420 --> 05:56.110
Kids, invisible robot meat!

05:56.190 --> 05:57.780
Yeah, robot meat!

05:57.850 --> 05:59.290
Robot meat!
Robot meat!

05:59.360 --> 06:00.980
Robot meat!

06:02.520 --> 06:03.920
All right, if you all need
anything...

06:03.990 --> 06:09.660
anything at all, do not...
do not come next door.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.200
Carl.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.400
Carl.

06:16.470 --> 06:18.530
Hey, Carl.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.940
Carl!
- Aah!

06:22.010 --> 06:22.980
We can't sleep.

06:23.050 --> 06:23.880
Can you?!

06:23.950 --> 06:25.570
Get out of my frigging house!

06:25.650 --> 06:27.050
No. l want some water.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.550
Yes, we all want water.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.550
Yay, water!
Yay, water!

06:30.620 --> 06:31.780
All right, fine.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.520
Get some in the bathroom,
and then get out of here.

06:35.290 --> 06:36.850
Robots don't drink water.

06:36.930 --> 06:37.950
Use your brain.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.760
You've failed test number one.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.350
What are you talking
about, man?

06:41.430 --> 06:44.830
You will pass, or else!

06:45.370 --> 06:46.360
Or else what?

06:46.440 --> 06:48.400
Aah! My shoulder hair!

06:48.470 --> 06:49.560
Come on, kids.

06:49.640 --> 06:50.830
Chubby is grumpy.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.240
Chubby's grumpy.

06:52.310 --> 06:53.270
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:53.340 --> 06:54.330
Do the other one.

06:54.410 --> 06:55.970
At least, make it even.

06:56.050 --> 06:58.010
Aah! Now get out of here!

06:58.080 --> 06:59.050
Hey, ma.

06:59.110 --> 07:00.710
lt's Carl.
- Hey.

07:00.780 --> 07:01.880
How are you doing?

07:02.990 --> 07:05.180
Well, ma,
think about packing my bags

07:05.250 --> 07:08.520
and planning a trip to
that really, uh, dark,

07:08.590 --> 07:10.650
dismal V.A. Hospital you live at.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.020
Carl, come outside!

07:12.090 --> 07:13.030
Coming out!

07:13.100 --> 07:13.990
Oh, no, no, no.

07:14.060 --> 07:14.960
l'll... l'll bring a cot.

07:15.030 --> 07:16.290
l won't lay in bed with you.

07:16.370 --> 07:17.660
Come here.
- Carl!

07:17.730 --> 07:19.330
l need a change of scenery,
you know,

07:19.400 --> 07:21.490
and l love to
see my favorite woman.

07:21.570 --> 07:22.800
Say "bye."
- Hang up, Carl.

07:22.870 --> 07:24.840
What do you mean
"tomorrow's physical therapy"?

07:24.910 --> 07:25.740
Come on, Carl.

07:25.810 --> 07:27.800
lt's Carl, your son.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.210
Yeah, the one with the mustache.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.510
Carl, come on out!

07:31.580 --> 07:33.070
Oh, is that right?

07:33.150 --> 07:35.480
Then you, too, you bitch!

07:36.650 --> 07:38.450
Carl, l've been calling you.

07:39.350 --> 07:41.480
So, um, yeah, l need some water.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.650
Yes, l'm completely parched.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.060
Yeah, we all crave water.

07:46.130 --> 07:47.530
Yay, water! Yay!

07:47.600 --> 07:51.000
But l thought you
robots don't drink water.

07:51.070 --> 07:52.560
No, but, sometimes, we do.

07:52.630 --> 07:53.500
We, uh...

07:53.570 --> 07:54.590
That was... there's... you know,

07:54.670 --> 07:57.160
there is a hole in the, um...

07:57.240 --> 07:58.230
Damn it! He passed!

07:58.310 --> 08:00.400
Now, dear,
just t-take it easy.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.700
See you in an hour.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.410
Come on, pick up, man.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.610
Pick up. Pick up.

08:11.690 --> 08:12.950
Pick up.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.750
Hi, this is Frylock.

08:14.820 --> 08:16.520
l'm not able to answer
your call right now,

08:16.590 --> 08:18.530
because l'm currently being
cocooned by military spiders

08:18.590 --> 08:20.120
in a cave in the
Mojave Desert.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.220
At the sound of the tone...

08:21.300 --> 08:23.160
"At the sound of the tone"?

08:23.230 --> 08:25.000
Wouldn't it just be
"at the tone"?

08:25.070 --> 08:26.970
Shut up, Shake!
l like to be thorough, okay?

08:28.370 --> 08:30.460
Damn it. Damn it!

08:30.540 --> 08:31.600
Has it been an hour yet?

08:31.670 --> 08:33.730
No.
- l'm so sorry.

08:33.809 --> 08:35.110
l'm so rude.

08:36.409 --> 08:39.610
l have peeled this house like a
banana, and still, nothing.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.740
Where could he have possibly
gone?

08:41.820 --> 08:43.610
l have absolutely nothing to do.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.420
Now... now, honey,
we still have the tests.

08:46.490 --> 08:49.320
Well, l guess l won't get to
do them, will l?

08:49.390 --> 08:52.260
All my work down
the space drain.

08:52.330 --> 08:55.460
Something moved...
inside the car.

08:55.530 --> 08:56.560
Test the knob.

08:58.570 --> 09:00.030
Locked!
- Damn him!

09:00.100 --> 09:02.900
The glass is tinted and
impenetrable!

09:04.270 --> 09:06.070
All right, all right.
l'm coming out.

09:06.140 --> 09:06.970
l'm coming out.

09:07.040 --> 09:07.940
No, get off there!

09:08.010 --> 09:09.770
l had to frigging
special-order that.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.970
Oh. How's it going?

09:11.050 --> 09:12.100
Where you been, man?

09:12.180 --> 09:14.270
Uh, l been on the moon.

09:14.350 --> 09:16.320
Okay, the moon. Wow.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.510
Apply the diodes.

09:22.260 --> 09:24.420
You will feel no pain.

09:24.490 --> 09:25.820
But you must sit very still.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.090
You must sit very still.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.890
Ring this bell when
the flies come.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.400
Ring this bell when the flies
come.

09:31.470 --> 09:32.360
Okay.

09:32.430 --> 09:34.030
ls this a... is this a test?

09:34.100 --> 09:36.230
Yeah, it's a test. Sure.

09:36.310 --> 09:37.400
See you in one hour.

09:37.470 --> 09:39.030
Okay, l got a bee.
Does a bee count?

09:39.110 --> 09:40.010
Hey! Hey!

09:40.080 --> 09:41.840
No. No, only flies.

09:41.910 --> 09:42.740
Only flies.

09:42.810 --> 09:45.910
We have had legendary
arguments with flies!

09:45.980 --> 09:47.570
Hey, look!

09:47.650 --> 09:48.670
lnsects!

09:48.750 --> 09:50.180
l did good, right?

09:50.250 --> 09:52.190
Yeah, again, not flies.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.850
Why didn't you call flies
like l asked?

09:53.920 --> 09:55.910
Well, you didn't tell
me to call the frigging...

09:55.990 --> 09:56.820
Yeah, l did.

09:56.890 --> 09:58.050
That's why we gave you the bell.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.860
All right, let's be
clear about this.

09:59.930 --> 10:02.690
You told me to use the bell when
the flies showed up,

10:02.760 --> 10:05.030
not to use the bell
to call the flies.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.000
Silly human.

10:06.070 --> 10:06.970
See?

10:14.810 --> 10:17.640
l'm pretty sure the flies are on
their way.

10:21.050 --> 10:24.020
You failed the final test!

10:24.090 --> 10:25.780
And now you die.

10:27.390 --> 10:28.380
No, no, no, no, no.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.580
l still got one more test here.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.590
l got a test, uh, for you.

10:32.660 --> 10:34.990
Well, we don't... yeah,
we don't take tests.

10:35.060 --> 10:36.930
Yeah, but this one's
super easy.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.830
lt's called, uh...

10:38.900 --> 10:40.420
"Count the Bullets."

10:40.500 --> 10:41.990
Well, we're not good at math.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.074
