WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:03.700
- HELLO, DEARS.

00:03.700 --> 00:04.933
- HEY, MA.
- HEY.

00:04.933 --> 00:06.967
- ROBERT, HAVE YOU AND AMY

00:06.967 --> 00:08.933
SET A DATE
FOR THE WEDDING YET?

00:08.933 --> 00:11.400
- HERE WE GO.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.100
- LOOK, MA, WE HAVEN'T EVEN
WORKED UP THE NERVE

00:14.100 --> 00:16.967
TO TELL HER PARENTS
WE'RE ENGAGED.

00:16.967 --> 00:19.000
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.400
- FOR THEM TO DIE.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.867
- OH, RAYMOND, DON'T SAY THAT.

00:23.867 --> 00:27.000
THAT COULD TAKE YEARS.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.900
- WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?

00:28.900 --> 00:30.000
- A MOVIE.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.100
- NOPE.
- UH...

00:33.933 --> 00:35.933
- HI, DADDY.
- HI, DADDY.

00:35.933 --> 00:37.800
- HEY, GUYS!
HEY!

00:37.800 --> 00:38.867
OH, TICKLE MONSTER!

00:38.867 --> 00:41.267
[laughter]

00:41.267 --> 00:42.600
WHAT'S UP?

00:42.600 --> 00:44.167
- DADDY, WE'RE GOING OUTSIDE,
OKAY?

00:44.167 --> 00:48.067
- ALL RIGHT.
DON'T THROW ROCKS.

00:48.067 --> 00:49.233
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

00:49.233 --> 00:51.033
DID YOU TWO CLEAN YOUR ROOM?

00:51.033 --> 00:52.767
- DADDY SAID
WE COULD GO OUTSIDE.

00:52.767 --> 00:55.067
- OH, NICE TRY.

00:55.067 --> 00:56.767
THAT ROOM IS A DISASTER AREA,

00:56.767 --> 01:00.333
AND I ASKED YOU TWO
TO CLEAN IT HALF AN HOUR AGO.

01:03.567 --> 01:05.200
- MAYBE THEY GO OUTSIDE

01:05.200 --> 01:06.467
AND THEY CAN FINISH UP
A LITTLE LATER.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.933
- NO, RAY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:08.933 --> 01:11.733
YOU TWO GET UPSTAIRS
AND CLEAN YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!

01:17.067 --> 01:19.433
- MOMMY'S MEAN.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.500
- [sighs]

01:23.500 --> 01:26.467
RAY, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
IN THE KITCHEN FOR A MINUTE?

01:30.600 --> 01:33.567
- MA, CAN I GO OUTSIDE?

01:37.167 --> 01:39.333
- RAY, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.100
- HI, GRANDMA.
HI, GRANDPA.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.400
- HELLO, DEAR.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.800
OH, FRANK,
DOESN'T ALLY LOOK NICE

01:46.800 --> 01:49.100
IN HER FRONTIER GIRL UNIFORM?

01:49.100 --> 01:51.200
- GREAT.
WHEN'S COOKIE SEASON?

01:54.100 --> 01:55.267
- IN THE SPRING.

01:55.267 --> 01:57.033
- I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.467
- HAVE A GOOD TIME, SWEETHEART.

01:59.467 --> 02:00.500
- HAVE FUN.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.067
- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
SWEETIE.

02:02.067 --> 02:04.500
OKAY, SO I GUESS
WE'LL TALK LATER,

02:04.500 --> 02:06.267
'CAUSE I HAVE TO TAKE ALLY
TO HER MEETING.

02:06.267 --> 02:08.800
BUT YOU MAKE SURE THAT THE BOYS
CLEAN THAT ROOM.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.333
- OH, DEBRA, I'LL CLEAN UP.

02:10.333 --> 02:14.800
IN FACT, I'LL GIVE
THE WHOLE UPSTAIRS A ONCE-OVER.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.933
AND THEN THE DOWNSTAIRS.

02:17.933 --> 02:19.200
- THANK YOU, MARIE,

02:19.200 --> 02:21.033
BUT THE BOYS CAN DO IT
THEMSELVES.

02:21.033 --> 02:22.700
- BOYS SHOULD PLAY.

02:22.700 --> 02:25.500
I HARDLY EVER USED TO
MAKE RAYMOND TIDY UP.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.367
- I KNOW, MARIE,
AND THANK YOU FOR THAT.

02:30.700 --> 02:34.100
- YEP, FOR RAYMOND, IT WAS,
"DON'T WORRY. GO PLAY."

02:34.100 --> 02:37.233
WHAT I GOT WAS,
"ROBBIE, DUST THE CEILING."

02:42.067 --> 02:43.467
- SO, YOU KNOW,

02:43.467 --> 02:45.400
MY MOM'S GOT IT ALL COVERED,
ALL RIGHT?

02:45.400 --> 02:48.600
- RAY, YOU MAKE SURE
THAT THE BOYS DO IT THEMSELVES.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.767
AND FOR ONCE, DON'T BE AFRAID
TO BE THE BAD GUY.

02:51.767 --> 02:53.200
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:53.200 --> 02:54.833
- WELL, I MEAN,
YOU ALWAYS GET TO BE

02:54.833 --> 02:57.100
CAPTAIN GOODTIMES AROUND HERE,
AND MOMMY IS THE EVIL WITCH

02:57.100 --> 02:59.500
WHO SHOWS UP
TO SPOIL EVERYBODY'S FUN.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.567
- NO, THAT'S RAY'S MOMMY.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.267
- DEBRA, WHEN IT COMES
TO DISCIPLINE,

03:07.267 --> 03:08.667
IT'S ONLY NATURAL

03:08.667 --> 03:10.867
FOR ONE OF THE PARENTS
TO BE THE BAD GUY.

03:10.867 --> 03:12.267
- I WAS THE BEST BAD GUY

03:12.267 --> 03:15.100
EVER TO WALK THE STREETS
OF LYNBROOK.

03:15.100 --> 03:17.300
THESE TWO KNEW
NOT TO MESS WITH ME.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.233
WHEN THEY WERE UP TO
THEIR USUAL MONKEYSHINES,

03:19.233 --> 03:21.633
ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS GIVE 'EM THE STEP.

03:21.633 --> 03:22.600
- WHAT'S THAT?

03:26.533 --> 03:29.900
- ALL RIGHT, JUST TAKE IT EASY.
- ALL RIGHT, JUST RELAX.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.033
- [chuckling]

03:32.033 --> 03:34.033
END OF MONKEYSHINES!

03:34.033 --> 03:36.000
- WOW.
- HE WAS GOOD.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.100
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.433
NOBODY HAS TO BE THE BAD GUY

03:38.433 --> 03:40.033
IF YOU WOULD JUST BE
A LITTLE BIT FIRMER

03:40.033 --> 03:41.500
IN SETTING LIMITS FOR THE KIDS.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.167
BUT I KNOW YOU;
YOU'RE WORRIED THAT IF YOU DO,

03:43.167 --> 03:44.767
THEY WON'T LIKE YOU.

03:44.767 --> 03:45.933
- NO, NO.
- YES.

03:45.933 --> 03:48.267
- YES.

03:48.267 --> 03:50.433
IT'S SAD, REALLY.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.733
THIS OBSESSION
WITH BEING LIKED BY EVERYONE

03:55.733 --> 04:00.533
HAS NOW CONTAMINATED
YOUR CHILD-REARING.

04:00.533 --> 04:01.733
- DO ME A FAVOR.

04:01.733 --> 04:03.467
I GOT AN AIR FRESHENER
IN THE CAR.

04:03.467 --> 04:05.733
COULD YOU HANG IT
OFF YOUR NOSE?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.167
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO REASON
FOR RAYMOND TO BE THE BAD GUY

04:17.167 --> 04:20.367
WHEN DEBRA'S
SO NATURALLY GOOD AT IT.

04:20.367 --> 04:22.267
- I'M NOT GOOD AT IT.

04:22.267 --> 04:24.800
- OH, THAT WAS A COMPLIMENT,
DEAR.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.967
SEE, WHEN MY BOYS ACTED UP,

04:26.967 --> 04:28.567
ALL I'D HAVE TO SAY IS,

04:28.567 --> 04:30.167
"WAIT TILL
YOUR FATHER GETS HOME."

04:30.167 --> 04:32.333
- OH, I WOULD LOVE
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT,

04:32.333 --> 04:34.600
BUT WHENEVER I SAY, "WAIT
TILL YOUR FATHER GETS HOME,"

04:34.600 --> 04:36.833
THE TWINS SAY,
"GREAT! HE WORKS FOR US."

04:36.833 --> 04:38.300
- [giggles]

04:38.300 --> 04:41.067
- YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.

04:41.067 --> 04:44.200
- THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT GOES, HONEY.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.533
HOW COULD YOU EVER BE
THE BAD GUY?

04:47.533 --> 04:48.633
- STOP IT!

04:48.633 --> 04:51.133
- [baby talk]
WHO'S THE BAD GUY?

04:51.133 --> 04:52.800
OH, WE'VE TOUCHED A NERVE.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.133
- DID NOT.
SHUT UP.

04:54.133 --> 04:55.700
- TOUCHED A NERVE.
- GET OUT OF HERE.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.200
- HEY, LISTEN,

04:57.200 --> 04:59.033
IF YOU'D JUST LAY DOWN THE LAW
ONCE IN A WHILE,

04:59.033 --> 05:01.033
MAYBE THE TWINS
WOULD RESPECT YOU MORE.

05:01.033 --> 05:02.100
- THEY RESPECT ME.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.533
- OH, THEY DO?
WHEN?

05:03.533 --> 05:04.867
WHEN YOU TELL THEM
TO GET DRESSED

05:04.867 --> 05:06.167
AND I FIND THEM WATCHING TV

05:06.167 --> 05:08.767
WITH THEIR PANTS
ON TOP OF THEIR HEADS?

05:08.767 --> 05:10.433
- I'M A FUN DAD.

05:10.433 --> 05:12.800
- YEAH, WELL, YOU'VE GOT
THE "FUN" PART RIGHT.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.733
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

05:14.733 --> 05:17.000
- YOU'RE A LOUSY DAD.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.333
- I GOT TO TAKE ALLY
TO HER MEETING.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.067
I'LL BE BACK IN A LITTLE WHILE.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.467
- COME ON.

05:25.467 --> 05:28.233
YOU'VE SEEN ME LAY DOWN THE LAW,
RIGHT?

05:28.233 --> 05:30.200
I'VE SEEN YOU LAY DOWN.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.000
[chuckles]

05:32.000 --> 05:33.400
- NOW ROLL OVER.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.567
[laughs]

05:34.567 --> 05:39.300
- AW, HE'S SUCH A GOOD BOY.

05:43.633 --> 05:46.367
- GUYS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- PLAYING.

05:46.367 --> 05:48.333
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CLEAN UP
YOUR ROOM.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.433
- FIVE MORE MINUTES.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.500
- NO.
NO, NOT THIS TIME.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.567
NOT FIVE MORE MINUTES, NOW.

05:56.967 --> 05:58.900
GUYS, I WANT YOU
TO CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.100
- FIVE MORE MINUTES.

06:00.100 --> 06:05.167
- NO--
GUYS, I MEAN IT.

06:05.167 --> 06:08.167
GUYS, I'M NOT FOOLING AROUND,
OKAY?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.000
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.667
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:25.967 --> 06:27.800
[both growl]

06:27.800 --> 06:29.733
- LISTEN, GUYS, I MEAN IT.

06:29.733 --> 06:33.100
STOP. GUYS, I WANT YOU
TO CLEAN THIS ROOM NOW.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.533
COME ON, GUYS.
I'M NOT FOOLING AROUND!

06:34.533 --> 06:36.433
[boys shouting gleefully]
STOP IT.

06:36.433 --> 06:38.767
STOP IT, GUYS!
I'M GETTING ANNOYED NOW.

06:38.767 --> 06:41.067
STOP THIS! GUYS!

06:41.067 --> 06:43.967
OKAY, NO TV FOR A MONTH!

06:43.967 --> 06:46.300
- WHAT?

06:46.300 --> 06:48.100
- YOU'RE GOING TO CLEAN
THIS ROOM, ALL RIGHT?

06:48.100 --> 06:49.767
AND THEN I'M GOING TO FIND
SOME MORE WORK FOR YOU TO DO,

06:49.767 --> 06:52.200
LIKE--LIKE TAKE OUT THE TRASH
EVERY DAY.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.733
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:53.733 --> 06:56.100
USED TO BE MY JOB.
WELL, NOW IT'S YOURS, OKAY?

06:56.100 --> 06:58.767
YOU WANT TO LIVE HERE,
I'M THE BOSS.

06:58.767 --> 07:01.733
I DON'T WORK FOR YOU.
YOU WORK FOR ME.

07:01.733 --> 07:02.933
- WHAT'S ALL THE YELL--

07:02.933 --> 07:05.467
- AH AH AH AH!
I GOT IT!

07:05.467 --> 07:07.600
- MOMMY!
- DADDY'S BEING MEAN!

07:07.600 --> 07:08.800
- AND CRAZY!

07:08.800 --> 07:11.900
- OH, I'M CRAZY?
I'M CR--YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:11.900 --> 07:13.900
FORGET ABOUT CLEANING UP
THE ROOM, BECAUSE IT'S BEDTIME.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.267
COME ON.
- RAY...

07:15.267 --> 07:16.700
- SAY GOOD NIGHT TO MOMMY.
GO, GET IN BED.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.500
GET IN BED. COME ON.
COME ON. LIE DOWN.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.667
LIE DOWN OVER THERE.
GO. LIE DOWN!

07:20.667 --> 07:22.233
- RAY, IT'S NOON.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.600
- WELL, THAT'S THE NEW BEDTIME!

07:24.600 --> 07:26.933
ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT KIDDING
AROUND ANYMORE!

07:26.933 --> 07:28.567
NO MORE FUN STUFF!

07:28.567 --> 07:29.967
AND IF THERE'S ANY MORE
SCREWING AROUND,

07:29.967 --> 07:32.633
NO TV, NO DESSERT,

07:32.633 --> 07:36.633
NO CHRISTMAS, EASTER,
FOURTH OF JULY, OR HALLOWEEN!

07:38.067 --> 07:39.200
- RAY, YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.333
- NIGHT-NIGHT.
LIGHTS OUT.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.233
JUST PUT YOUR HANDS
OVER YOUR EYES

07:44.233 --> 07:46.533
AND PRETEND THAT IT'S DARK OUT.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.133
COME ON. COME ON.
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

07:49.800 --> 07:53.533
SWEET DREAMS, GENTLEMEN.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.800
I SUGGEST YOU SLEEP,

07:57.800 --> 07:59.500
'CAUSE I'M PLANNING ON
FILLING THE GARBAGE TOMORROW

07:59.500 --> 08:02.000
WITH THE HEAVIEST,
HEAVIEST GARBAGE!

08:10.300 --> 08:12.167
- THESE TWO WERE HUNGRY,
SO I MADE SANDWICHES.

08:12.167 --> 08:13.233
- GREAT.
- HEY!

08:13.233 --> 08:15.633
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:15.633 --> 08:16.800
- NOTHING.

08:16.800 --> 08:21.833
YOU WORK UP AN APPETITE
LAYING DOWN THE LAW.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.100
- RAY JUST PUT THE TWINS TO BED

08:23.100 --> 08:25.500
AND TOOK AWAY
ALL THEIR HOLIDAYS.

08:26.933 --> 08:28.567
- HEY, ALL RIGHT.

08:28.567 --> 08:30.733
DID YOU TAKE AWAY
BIRTHDAYS TOO?

08:30.733 --> 08:32.333
- I'M SAVING THAT.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.600
WE'LL SEE HOW THEY DO
WITH THE GARBAGE TOMORROW.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.133
- VERY GOOD.
- RAY, LISTEN TO ME.

08:36.133 --> 08:37.900
I KNOW WHAT YOU WERE TRYING
TO DO UP THERE,

08:37.900 --> 08:39.833
BUT THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I MEANT BY SETTING LIMITS.

08:39.833 --> 08:41.300
- WELL, THAT IS HOW
YOU SET LIMITS, OKAY?

08:41.300 --> 08:42.500
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.733
- I THINK
MAYBE YOU WENT TOO FAR.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.367
- I THINK MAYBE I WENT
JUST RIGHT!

08:45.367 --> 08:46.600
- BUT DON'T YOU THINK
THAT MAYBE--

08:46.600 --> 08:49.200
- YES, I SCREWED UP!

08:49.200 --> 08:51.767
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL I'M DOING!

08:51.767 --> 08:53.267
WHY'D YOU MAKE ME DO THAT?

08:53.267 --> 08:54.600
- WHAT HAPPENED, RAYMOND?

08:54.600 --> 08:55.900
- I DON'T KNOW!

08:55.900 --> 08:58.700
I JUST STARTED YELLING,
AND THEN I COULDN'T STOP.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.133
WHY CAN'T YOU STAY
THE BAD GUY?

09:00.133 --> 09:01.933
CAN'T YOU SEE I STINK AT IT?

09:01.933 --> 09:03.333
- AW.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.267
OH, WELL, SWEETIE,
IT'S JUST NOT YOUR WAY.

09:06.267 --> 09:07.900
SEE, I THINK YOU SHOULD GO UP

09:07.900 --> 09:10.767
AND TAKE BACK THAT PUNISHMENT.

09:10.767 --> 09:11.967
AND THEN YOU, DEBRA,

09:11.967 --> 09:14.633
YOU GO UP
AND GIVE IT OUT AGAIN.

09:17.700 --> 09:18.867
- RAY, COME ON.

09:18.867 --> 09:20.533
YOU GO UP THERE
AND YOU SAY YOU'RE SORRY,

09:20.533 --> 09:21.967
AND WE'LL GET IT ALL WORKED OUT.

09:21.967 --> 09:23.733
- [sighs]
YEAH.

09:23.733 --> 09:25.467
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.633
- YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
- WHAT?

09:30.633 --> 09:33.133
- YOU BACK DOWN NOW,
YOU'LL BE THEIR PUPPET.

09:33.133 --> 09:34.667
YOU'LL BE A PERMANENT
PARTY CLOWN

09:34.667 --> 09:37.500
WITH BUBBLES
COMING OUT OF YOUR BEHIND.

09:40.100 --> 09:41.733
- COME ON, FRANK,

09:41.733 --> 09:44.067
WHAT RAY DID
WAS COMPLETELY UNFAIR.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.733
- UNFAIR
IS WHAT KIDS REMEMBER.

09:45.733 --> 09:48.600
UNFAIR IS WHAT KEEPS THEM
ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.133
REMEMBER IN HIGH SCHOOL
HOW YOU USED TO WHINE

09:51.133 --> 09:53.633
ABOUT HOW UNFAIR
YOUR 9:00 CURFEW WAS?

09:53.633 --> 09:56.400
WELL, IT KEPT YOU
OUT OF TROUBLE, NOW DIDN'T IT?

09:56.400 --> 09:59.500
LIKE IT OR NOT, UNFAIR WORKS!

10:03.600 --> 10:06.733
- EXCEPT THAT RAY
WOULD COME HOME AT 9:00,

10:06.733 --> 10:08.233
WAIT FOR YOU TO FALL ASLEEP,

10:08.233 --> 10:10.733
AND THEN SNEAK BACK OUT.

10:13.167 --> 10:15.467
- RAYMOND, IS THAT TRUE?

10:15.467 --> 10:17.967
- NO, IT IS NOT TRUE, MARIE.

10:17.967 --> 10:20.967
IT IS MANURE.

10:20.967 --> 10:25.033
- AND HE WOULD ALWAYS BRAG THAT
HE HAD THE STAIRS MEMORIZED--

10:25.033 --> 10:28.100
YOU KNOW, WHICH ONES
WOULD SQUEAK, WHICH DIDN'T.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.400
AND ONCE HE GOT DOWN 'EM,

10:29.400 --> 10:31.200
IT WAS OUT THE DOOR
FOR ANOTHER NIGHT

10:31.200 --> 10:35.233
OF BAD JUDGMENT
AND QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR.

10:36.733 --> 10:38.833
- BALONEY!

10:38.833 --> 10:40.167
RAY KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

10:40.167 --> 10:41.567
IF HE BLINKED
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

10:41.567 --> 10:44.000
I HAD HIM SHIVERING
IN HIS BOOTS.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.633
HE KNEW IF HE LIVED
IN MY HOUSE,

10:45.633 --> 10:47.633
HE LIVED BY MY RULES.

10:47.633 --> 10:50.433
SNEAK OUT? HA!

10:52.300 --> 10:54.933
- ACTUALLY, DAD,
WITH YOUR SNORING,

10:54.933 --> 10:58.500
I COULD HAVE MARCHED OUT
OF THERE BLOWING A TRUMPET.

11:00.800 --> 11:04.700
- YOU LITTLE PUNK.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.000
- SO WHERE WOULD YOU GO?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.333
- ANYWHERE.
PARTIES, BERNIE'S HOUSE.

11:08.333 --> 11:11.200
- WELL, HIS MOTHER'S
GETTING A CALL.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.133
- SOMETIMES I JUST TOOK
THE VALIANT OUT FOR A DRIVE.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.800
- YOU TOOK MY CAR?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.167
- I'D ALWAYS REFILL THE GAS

11:17.167 --> 11:19.567
SO HE'D NEVER KNOW
THAT IT WAS GONE.

11:19.567 --> 11:22.400
- IT WAS KIND OF BRILLIANT.
- YEAH, YEP.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.767
AND BY THE WAY,
ROBERT DID IT TOO.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.733
- NEVER!

11:27.733 --> 11:29.333
- YES, OH, YES.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.100
I REMEMBER ONCE,
WE SNUCK OUT

11:31.100 --> 11:32.633
TO GO TO THE JETHRO TULL
CONCERT,

11:32.633 --> 11:35.267
AND HE STOLE A BOTTLE
OF PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS

11:35.267 --> 11:36.833
FROM YOUR LIQUOR CABINET.

11:36.833 --> 11:39.300
- HE'S LYING!

11:49.333 --> 11:51.167
- YEAH, I KNOW HE IS,

11:51.167 --> 11:53.133
'CAUSE I HAD
THAT CABINET PADLOCKED.

11:53.133 --> 11:55.800
- YES, THAT'S WHY HE HAD TO
INCH IT AWAY FROM THE WALL

11:55.800 --> 11:58.100
AND POP OUT THE BACK PANEL.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.167
- [gasps]

11:59.167 --> 12:00.800
YOU DRANK?

12:00.800 --> 12:04.300
- YOU POPPED OUT
THE BACK PANEL?

12:05.967 --> 12:08.533
- THEN AFTER THE CONCERT,
ROBERT WAS SO SCHNOCKERED,

12:08.533 --> 12:10.467
HE WANTED TO FIGHT ANYBODY
WHO DIDN'T AGREE

12:10.467 --> 12:14.767
THAT "BUNGLE IN THE JUNGLE"
WAS THE BEST SONG EVER WRITTEN.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.133
- THAT'S A GREAT SONG.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.667
BUT THIS IS LIES!

12:22.100 --> 12:23.833
- YEAH, I REMEMBER
THE NEXT MORNING,

12:23.833 --> 12:25.300
HE THREW UP IN THE LIVING ROOM,

12:25.300 --> 12:27.133
AND YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHY
THE HOUSE SMELLED

12:27.133 --> 12:29.200
LIKE MINT VOMIT.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.700
- YOU TOLD ME YOU HAD
A BAD CANDY CANE.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.767
- OH, FRANK, OUR SONS
ARE JUVENILE DELINQUENTS.

12:41.767 --> 12:43.367
- YEAH, WELL, RAY WAS WORSE.

12:43.367 --> 12:45.267
YOU KNOW THAT TIME
WE ALL WENT UP TO THE POCONOS?

12:45.267 --> 12:47.033
HE HAD A GIRL IN HIS ROOM.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.233
- OH, YEAH?
- RAYMOND!

12:49.233 --> 12:53.367
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
FIRST OF ALL, I WAS 25.

12:53.367 --> 12:55.233
AND NOTHING HAPPENED.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.667
- YOU TOLD ME
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.800
- THAT'S RIGHT;
I TOLD YOU SOMETHING HAPPENED.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.700
NOTHING HAPPENED.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.333
- I KNEW IT. YOU SHOULD HAVE
SENT HER TO MY ROOM.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.167
- OH, YEAH, LIKE YOU WOULD KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.633
- I KNOW PLENTY.

13:05.633 --> 13:07.833
- YEAH, YOU KNOW.
YOU KNOW HOW TO THROW UP.

13:07.833 --> 13:09.633
- YOU THROW UP!

13:09.633 --> 13:12.000
- WORST SONG EVER WRITTEN:
"BUNGLE IN THE JUNGLE."

13:12.000 --> 13:13.567
- I'LL FIGHT YOU RIGHT NOW!

13:13.567 --> 13:14.933
[bickering]

13:14.933 --> 13:17.100
- QUIET!

13:17.100 --> 13:18.667
BE QUIET!

13:18.667 --> 13:20.500
- HE STARTED THE WHOLE THING
WITH--

13:28.200 --> 13:31.600
- I STILL GOT IT.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.100
- ACTUALLY, FRANK,
YOU OBVIOUSLY NEVER HAD IT.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.633
- WHAT?
- WAKE UP!

13:36.633 --> 13:39.800
YOU SPENT THEIR WHOLE CHILDHOOD
BEING A DREADFUL GOON,

13:39.800 --> 13:42.633
AND ALL IT DID WAS MAKE THEM
WANT TO SNEAK OUT OF THE HOUSE.

13:42.633 --> 13:46.100
- MAYBE THEY WANTED
TO GET AWAY FROM YOU.

13:47.333 --> 13:50.133
THAT'S WHY
I SNEAK OUT OF THE HOUSE.

13:52.733 --> 13:55.133
- DON'T YOU DARE TRY
TO TURN THIS AROUND.

13:55.133 --> 13:57.200
YOU INSISTED ON BEING
THE DISCIPLINARIAN.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.867
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID TO ME,

13:58.867 --> 14:01.367
"OH, DON'T HUG THEM SO MUCH.
YOU'LL MAKE THEM SOFT."

14:01.367 --> 14:04.067
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, I SHOULD HAVE
NEVER STOPPED HUGGING THEM!

14:04.067 --> 14:06.733
OH!

14:06.733 --> 14:10.400
I AM SO SORRY I LET
THIS CRAZY MAN LOOSE ON YOU.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.000
- STOP HUGGING THEM!

14:14.567 --> 14:15.700
- NO, FRANK.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.767
THAT'S WHAT PARENTING IS:
LOVE.

14:18.767 --> 14:20.333
YOU JUST LOVE 'EM.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.500
NO MATTER HOW MANY
BAD DECISIONS THEY MAKE,

14:22.500 --> 14:24.867
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
THEY DON'T LISTEN TO YOU,

14:24.867 --> 14:28.600
YOU JUST KEEP LOVING
AND HOPE THAT MAYBE SOMEDAY

14:28.600 --> 14:33.000
THAT LOVE WILL MAKE THEM REALIZE
HOW MUCH THEY HURT YOU.

14:40.700 --> 14:44.300
- AND YOU WONDER WHY
I DRANK THE SCHNAPPS.

14:47.133 --> 14:48.400
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:48.400 --> 14:49.933
I'M JUST GONNA TELL THE TWINS

14:49.933 --> 14:51.200
THAT THEY CAN DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT,

14:51.200 --> 14:52.767
BECAUSE NOTHING WORKS.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.500
- OH, COME ON, RAY.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.367
- WHAT?

14:56.367 --> 14:57.767
ALL HIS RULES EVER DID

14:57.767 --> 14:59.500
WAS MAKE ME GOOD
AT GETTING AROUND 'EM,

14:59.500 --> 15:01.567
SO MAYBE WE DON'T MAKE
SO MANY RULES.

15:01.567 --> 15:05.333
- LOOK, MY PARENTS MADE RULES,
BUT THEY TOOK THE TIME

15:05.333 --> 15:08.467
TO EXPLAIN THE REASONS
FOR THE RULES.

15:08.467 --> 15:10.767
AND THERE WAS MUTUAL RESPECT
BETWEEN US,

15:10.767 --> 15:13.567
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY
I NEVER FELT THE NEED

15:13.567 --> 15:18.467
TO SNEAK OUT OF THE HOUSE
OR GO JOYRIDING IN THEIR CAR.

15:18.467 --> 15:20.367
- YEAH.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.767
YOU NEVER FELT THE NEED
TO DO THAT.

15:22.767 --> 15:23.833
- NO.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.267
- BUT YOU DID FIND THE NEED

15:25.267 --> 15:26.867
TO GO TO MARDI GRAS
WHEN YOU WERE IN COLLEGE.

15:26.867 --> 15:28.000
- RAY.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
- AND AT THE PARADE...
- RAY.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.467
- YOU TOOK YOUR TOP OFF.
- RAY!

15:34.233 --> 15:37.333
- OH, MY GOD!

15:37.333 --> 15:38.800
- IT WAS NOTHING.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.100
IN COLLEGE,
EVERYBODY'S A LITTLE--

15:42.100 --> 15:44.467
IT WAS COLLEGE.
I WAS FINDING MYSELF.

15:44.467 --> 15:47.867
- YOU FOUND YOURSELF ON
PAGE SEVEN OF THE "DAILY NEWS"

15:47.867 --> 15:49.067
WITH YOUR BOOBS OUT.

15:49.067 --> 15:52.133
- RAY!

15:52.133 --> 15:56.100
- HOLY CRAP.

15:56.100 --> 16:00.000
- YOU MEAN, LIKE, TOPLESS?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.933
- IN THE "DAILY NEWS"?

16:01.933 --> 16:04.133
- I WAS NOT TOPLESS.

16:04.133 --> 16:08.700
THEY PUT A BLACK BAR
OVER THE EXPOSED AREA.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.233
- I HATE THOSE.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.167
- IT WAS SPRING BREAK.

16:14.167 --> 16:16.967
IT WAS A MOMENTARY
YOUTHFUL INDISCRETION.

16:16.967 --> 16:20.233
- THAT ENDED UP IN THE PAPER.

16:22.367 --> 16:24.500
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT, DEBRA?

16:24.500 --> 16:26.467
- COME ON.
IT IS NO BIG DEAL.

16:26.467 --> 16:28.000
IT WAS COLLEGE.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.400
- NOT A BIG DEAL?

16:29.400 --> 16:32.533
DEBRA, IN A FEW YEARS,
ALLY WILL BE IN COLLEGE.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.833
- BUT ALLY WOULD NEVER DO
ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

16:34.833 --> 16:36.433
BECAUSE WE WILL TEACH HER

16:36.433 --> 16:40.767
THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT
TO DO THINGS LIKE THAT, AND...

16:42.967 --> 16:45.867
- OH, BOY.

16:45.867 --> 16:47.233
- THAT'S THE THING, ALL RIGHT?

16:47.233 --> 16:48.867
NOW, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

16:48.867 --> 16:51.433
COME ON, I MANAGED TO SNEAK OUT
TO ANY PARTY I WANTED,

16:51.433 --> 16:56.100
AND I HAD MARIE AND BENITO
MUSSOLINI AS MY PARENTS.

16:58.067 --> 17:01.033
AND EVEN THOUGH
YOU HAD GOOD PARENTS,

17:01.033 --> 17:03.333
YOU STILL
WHIPPED OFF YOUR SHIRT

17:03.333 --> 17:05.633
IN FRONT OF A BUNCH OF DRUNKS
FOR A HANDFUL OF BEADS.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.667
WHOO!

17:07.667 --> 17:08.533
RIGHT?

17:08.533 --> 17:10.000
SO NO MATTER WHAT WE TELL ALLY

17:10.000 --> 17:13.200
AND--AND--
AND THE OTHER ONES,

17:13.200 --> 17:16.467
AREN'T THEY JUST GONNA DO
WHAT WE DID?

17:16.467 --> 17:19.267
OR WORSE?

17:21.100 --> 17:24.067
- YOU NEED TO BUILD A CAGE.

17:28.167 --> 17:29.400
- WELL, WE NEED SOMETHING.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.833
- ALL RIGHT, DON'T PANIC.

17:30.833 --> 17:32.333
- NO, WE GOTTA TO HAVE A PLAN
HERE, OKAY?

17:32.333 --> 17:33.767
HOW ARE WE GONNA CONTROL
THESE KIDS?

17:33.767 --> 17:35.833
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME FOR?

17:35.833 --> 17:37.000
- BECAUSE IT'S GOT TO BE YOU.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.633
I CAN'T EVEN PUT THEIR PJs ON.

17:38.633 --> 17:40.633
YOU THINK I'M GONNA BE ABLE
TO TAKE AWAY THEIR BEER

17:40.633 --> 17:43.067
AND THEIR CIGARETTES?

17:44.633 --> 17:48.867
- YESTERDAY ALLY ASKED ME
IF SHE COULD BUY A MINISKIRT.

17:48.867 --> 17:52.200
- OH, CRAP.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.533
- YOU'VE ALREADY LOST.

17:54.533 --> 17:56.733
- YOU TELL ALLY
THE ANSWER IS NO.

17:56.733 --> 17:58.433
NO SKIRTS OF ANY KIND.

17:58.433 --> 18:00.767
PANTS.
SNOW PANTS!

18:02.833 --> 18:03.867
- AH, YOU CAN'T WIN.

18:03.867 --> 18:05.467
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,

18:05.467 --> 18:07.667
THEY'RE STILL GONNA GRAB
YOUR BOOZE AND GO TO A CONCERT.

18:07.667 --> 18:08.700
- NO CONCERTS.

18:08.700 --> 18:11.033
SHIRTS CAN COME OFF
AT CONCERTS TOO.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.233
- I GOTTA START A BAND.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.367
- GUYS, IT'S OKAY.

18:31.367 --> 18:34.033
YOU CAN WAKE UP NOW.

18:34.033 --> 18:36.500
SIT UP, GUYS.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.833
MICHAEL, COME OVER HERE.
COME ON.

18:39.833 --> 18:42.433
LISTEN, GUYS.

18:42.433 --> 18:46.733
I SAID SOMETHING BEFORE
THAT WAS PRETTY HARSH.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.400
BUT, UH, I SAID IT,

18:48.400 --> 18:50.867
AND I'M STICKING BY IT.

18:50.867 --> 18:52.267
OKAY?
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

18:52.267 --> 18:55.333
I'M NOT BACKING DOWN.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.633
SO IF YOU THINK, YOU KNOW,
:DADDY'S A PARTY CLOWN;

18:57.633 --> 18:59.200
"LOOK AT THE BUBBLES
COMING OUT OF HIS HEINIE,"

18:59.200 --> 19:00.667
YOU CAN JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

19:02.567 --> 19:04.033
BUT...

19:04.033 --> 19:07.600
I MIGHT HAVE A DEAL
FOR YOU GUYS.

19:07.600 --> 19:11.167
YOU WANT YOUR TV BACK
AND HOLIDAYS

19:11.167 --> 19:13.733
AND STAYING UP
UNTIL IT'S DARK OUT?

19:15.100 --> 19:18.300
OKAY, WELL,
I CAN MAKE ALL THAT HAPPEN

19:18.300 --> 19:21.067
IF YOU JUST PROMISE ME
ONE THING.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.500
OKAY?

19:22.500 --> 19:23.767
JUST PROMISE ME

19:23.767 --> 19:26.000
YOU'LL OBEY EVERYTHING
MOMMY AND DADDY TELL YOU

19:26.000 --> 19:28.567
FROM NOW UNTIL YOU'RE...

19:28.567 --> 19:31.167
60...

19:31.167 --> 19:33.133
5.
65, OKAY?

19:33.133 --> 19:37.133
THAT SEEMS FAIR.

19:37.133 --> 19:38.167
DEAL?

19:38.167 --> 19:39.967
- DEAL.
- DEAL.

19:39.967 --> 19:42.000
- ALL RIGHT, COME HERE.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.567
ALL RIGHT,
NOW, LISTEN, GUYS.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.800
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
THAT I'M AN IDIOT

19:46.800 --> 19:50.433
AND I REALLY BELIEVE
THAT WE'VE GOT A DEAL HERE.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.267
YOUR MOTHER
AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING,

19:52.267 --> 19:54.533
AND WE KNOW
THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET OLDER

19:54.533 --> 19:56.267
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO THINGS,

19:56.267 --> 20:00.067
AND WE KNOW THERE'S NOTHING
THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

20:00.067 --> 20:05.000
BUT, GUYS, IF YOU DO,
MAKE SURE...

20:05.000 --> 20:08.633
WE NEVER FIND OUT ABOUT IT.

20:14.333 --> 20:17.267
WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.433
LISTEN, GUYS,
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY REASON

20:22.433 --> 20:24.033
WE WANT YOU TO DO
WHAT WE TELL YOU

20:24.033 --> 20:27.467
IS BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU, OKAY?

21:10.800 --> 21:12.500
WHERE SHOULD WE GO?

21:12.500 --> 21:16.433

ABOUT MARDI GRAS.

21:20.267 --> 21:23.233
[singing]
OH, WHEN THE SAINTS

21:23.233 --> 21:25.667
