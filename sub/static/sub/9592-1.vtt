00:32.177 --> 00:33.714
Fuck this shit.

01:02.876 --> 01:04.378
Let's go home.

01:12.318 --> 01:15.765
Regret and remorse. Amends and atonement.

01:15.822 --> 01:17.324
That's life, right?

01:17.891 --> 01:19.802
Well, this next one is for you,

01:19.859 --> 01:24.399
all you lost souls racing down
that long road to redemption,

01:24.464 --> 01:27.240
and all you sinners running from your past

01:27.300 --> 01:31.180
but heading straight
into that pit of darkness up ahead.

01:31.237 --> 01:34.150
We're all on the same endless highway,

01:34.207 --> 01:40.180
the one with no name, no exits, looking
for a way out of tonight and into tomorrow.

01:40.813 --> 01:44.488
Well, they're gonna try to stop you,
but you gotta say, "Fuck it,"

01:44.551 --> 01:48.158
and keep moving,
because this is your highway,

01:48.221 --> 01:51.225
and tonight might just be
the night you finally outrun

01:51.291 --> 01:54.101
those wicked demons once and for all.

01:54.160 --> 01:59.109
And I'll be right here with you
making sure you get where you're going.

02:34.734 --> 02:36.236
What's up?

02:36.869 --> 02:38.177
Nothing.

03:01.928 --> 03:03.908
Don't worry. We're fine.

03:27.220 --> 03:28.665
It's customers only.

03:31.424 --> 03:32.459
Hey!

03:35.194 --> 03:36.696
Read the sign.

03:41.968 --> 03:43.709
Twenty on the truck.

03:50.943 --> 03:52.354
Rough night?

03:56.182 --> 03:57.490
Yeah.

04:17.570 --> 04:19.173
Have a nice day.

04:55.675 --> 04:56.745
Fuck.

05:21.267 --> 05:23.645
Mitch! Let's get the fuck outta here.

05:25.438 --> 05:26.542
Come on!

05:30.510 --> 05:32.148
Come again soon.

05:39.552 --> 05:40.690
Fuck!

06:00.072 --> 06:01.210
What the fuck?

06:08.381 --> 06:10.224
What the fuck?

06:17.290 --> 06:18.701
Rough night?

06:37.543 --> 06:39.113
What the fuck?

07:19.252 --> 07:20.822
There's gotta be a way out.

07:30.563 --> 07:32.065
What if there's not?

07:34.767 --> 07:35.905
Pull over.

07:36.636 --> 07:37.979
- What?
- Pull over.

07:38.037 --> 07:39.516
Are you crazy?

07:40.273 --> 07:41.809
What are you gonna do?

07:42.575 --> 07:43.849
I'm not running.

07:44.810 --> 07:46.721
Mitch! Mitch!

07:49.448 --> 07:50.449
Hey!

07:51.150 --> 07:52.185
Hey!

07:53.085 --> 07:55.065
I know we've had a pretty fucked up day,

07:55.121 --> 07:57.965
but if you could keep it together for
a little bit longer, that would be great.

07:58.024 --> 08:00.163
Why? What are we running to?

08:00.226 --> 08:01.227
What?

08:01.294 --> 08:03.865
So we get out of here, we go home,
and then what?

08:03.930 --> 08:06.501
And then nothing! Then we're home!
That's the point!

08:06.565 --> 08:08.545
- Back to normal!
- Exactly.

08:09.402 --> 08:12.246
Mitch, you wanted this.

08:12.939 --> 08:16.250
We did this for you.
We did this for Kathryn.

08:16.309 --> 08:19.085
So get in the fucking truck.

08:19.378 --> 08:21.483
I'm not asking you to stay.

08:23.883 --> 08:25.089
You've lost it, man.

08:26.585 --> 08:28.121
You want to stay here and get killed?

08:29.121 --> 08:30.429
- I'll see you around.
- Jack.

08:31.824 --> 08:32.962
Come on.

08:39.432 --> 08:41.070
What do you want?

08:41.933 --> 08:43.607
Haven't you figured it out?

08:43.936 --> 08:45.244
They've come to collect.

08:47.473 --> 08:49.749
There's no way out. We fucked up.

08:50.943 --> 08:54.083
You know what, Mitch? Fuck you.
I'm going home.

09:00.920 --> 09:01.921
No!

09:02.822 --> 09:03.926
Jack!

11:35.441 --> 11:36.715
Dad?

11:41.780 --> 11:42.986
Kathryn?

12:02.434 --> 12:04.641
Dad! Why won't you help me?

12:07.306 --> 12:08.683
Kathryn!

12:17.516 --> 12:19.427
Dad, help me!

12:20.586 --> 12:21.860
Kathryn!

12:21.921 --> 12:24.299
Dad, I need help!

12:25.357 --> 12:26.495
Help!

12:26.559 --> 12:27.663
Fuck!

12:28.027 --> 12:29.734
Dad!

12:31.096 --> 12:34.475
Dad, I need your help! Help me!

12:35.401 --> 12:36.607
- Kathryn!
- Dad!

12:37.236 --> 12:38.510
- Kathryn!
- Dad!

12:39.171 --> 12:41.344
Fuck! Kathryn! Fuck!

12:42.641 --> 12:43.642
Fuck!

13:37.630 --> 13:38.836
Why?

13:40.199 --> 13:42.201
It's piercing my brain.

13:42.268 --> 13:45.181
My God. It's 1:00.

13:45.237 --> 13:48.946
Guys, we gotta go. Ava, get up.

13:50.242 --> 13:51.346
Come on.

13:51.410 --> 13:53.754
I've never been so hungover in my life.

14:00.619 --> 14:01.723
You guys got everything?

14:03.389 --> 14:06.927
Now, maybe you're out there
next to that special someone,

14:06.992 --> 14:10.201
that one who's going away.
But you're still here...

14:10.262 --> 14:11.570
It's too early for this!

14:13.032 --> 14:14.136
Baby.

14:14.667 --> 14:20.743
...gettin' on down that road, and this time,
hold on and don't ever let go.

14:36.422 --> 14:38.834
Kim! Kim!

15:10.956 --> 15:12.060
Shit!

15:27.373 --> 15:29.080
Man, this thing is fucked!

15:29.575 --> 15:32.852
Of course, on the one day
we can't afford to stop and get a flat.

15:32.978 --> 15:35.424
We'd be fine if your drum kit
didn't take up so much space.

15:35.481 --> 15:39.019
It wasn't my idea
to take out the spare tire, Kimberly.

15:39.084 --> 15:42.531
Whatever. Let's just call AAA.
Can you hand me my bag?

15:43.021 --> 15:45.524
Well, do we even know where we are?

15:49.261 --> 15:52.265
GPS can't even find us on my phone.

15:52.331 --> 15:53.867
No, we're not on a private road,

15:53.932 --> 15:56.071
we're in the middle
of a state highway right now.

15:56.435 --> 15:57.607
Why is it so hot?

15:57.669 --> 15:58.875
We can't help you.

15:58.937 --> 16:00.644
Well, yeah, thanks for nothing.

16:00.706 --> 16:02.185
Best of luck.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.885
The closest place is four hours from here.

16:06.578 --> 16:07.784
And it's closed.

16:07.846 --> 16:09.848
Why? It's so early.

16:10.215 --> 16:13.594
The chick on the phone
sounded like she was at a bar.

16:13.986 --> 16:15.659
Which reminds me.

16:17.556 --> 16:19.331
Wait, you're not serious, Kim.

16:19.391 --> 16:23.032
What? It's not like we're going anywhere.

16:31.036 --> 16:32.379
Warm beer.

16:51.623 --> 16:53.159
Guys! Car!

16:55.461 --> 16:58.670
Great. I was seriously thinking
who I'd have to eat first.

16:58.730 --> 17:00.038
It was you, by the way.

17:00.399 --> 17:01.742
Youngest!

17:06.839 --> 17:09.410
Can we offer you a ride?

17:12.044 --> 17:15.423
Is there a town close by?
AAA said that there's nothing for miles.

17:16.013 --> 17:17.857
Yeah, we're pretty far out.

17:17.915 --> 17:20.453
Actually, the closest town's
quite a way south.

17:20.519 --> 17:22.226
You're gonna want to go
to Pete's Auto Body.

17:22.688 --> 17:24.667
- Okay.
- Talk to Pete.

17:24.723 --> 17:26.760
Yeah, but he's not going to be there
until tomorrow, though.

17:28.760 --> 17:32.936
Why don't you come to our place?
Just until we can get a hold of Pete.

17:32.998 --> 17:37.140
Thanks, a lot, really, but we're good.
We're used to sleeping in the van.

17:37.202 --> 17:38.203
You know, Betty...

17:39.371 --> 17:41.248
I wonder if the camper over
at the Kensington's

17:41.306 --> 17:43.718
has the same size tire as that van?

17:43.775 --> 17:46.847
I'm sure they have a spare.
Bet the boys could fix you right up.

17:47.045 --> 17:49.787
Yeah. I guess. I mean, we could...

17:50.516 --> 17:54.464
No. No, no, no, we're good, we're good.
Thank you, though. Really.

17:56.955 --> 17:58.298
Well...

17:59.491 --> 18:01.129
Suit yourselves.

18:01.894 --> 18:02.964
Goodbye.

18:06.064 --> 18:08.135
- Wait!
- What? What are you doing?

18:08.200 --> 18:11.044
We don't know where we are,
we haven't seen another car in an hour...

18:11.136 --> 18:14.481
Am I the only one who thinks it's not
a good idea to go with a couple of weirdos?

18:14.540 --> 18:17.521
Look at us. Look at them.
We're the weirdos.

18:18.810 --> 18:22.417
I'd way rather go with them
than a bunch of rape-y dudes.

18:36.562 --> 18:38.599
So are you girls students?

18:38.664 --> 18:42.009
No, we're not. We are in a band.

18:43.502 --> 18:45.880
Fun! A rock and roll group!

18:45.938 --> 18:47.212
Yeah.

18:47.272 --> 18:48.751
We play jazz.

18:48.941 --> 18:50.181
Smooth jazz.

18:52.110 --> 18:53.646
I do love jazz.

18:58.083 --> 19:01.428
So, how long have you guys lived out here?

19:02.287 --> 19:03.561
I don't know.

19:03.622 --> 19:05.124
Since the war.

19:08.460 --> 19:10.565
Is that a trap or something?

19:10.629 --> 19:12.006
It probably was

19:12.464 --> 19:13.807
but broken now.

19:13.865 --> 19:15.208
Coyotes.

19:18.236 --> 19:19.977
This is your fault.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.018
All right.

19:31.149 --> 19:35.825
You don't have to worry about locking it up.
There's no one around for miles.

20:03.815 --> 20:05.192
Come on.

20:08.687 --> 20:11.497
Here we are. The bathroom is right there.

20:11.623 --> 20:13.000
Nap, shower...

20:13.458 --> 20:15.062
Anything that you need to do.

20:15.594 --> 20:18.905
The Kensington's
are going to be coming over for supper.

20:19.231 --> 20:22.212
It's just so wonderful
to have some company!

20:23.168 --> 20:25.079
I'm sorry about Alex...

20:25.804 --> 20:26.908
What did you say?

20:26.972 --> 20:29.612
It's just so wonderful
to have some company!

20:29.675 --> 20:31.279
No, before that.

20:31.510 --> 20:33.649
I will whip up some supper for us.

20:33.812 --> 20:35.155
Thank you.

20:38.150 --> 20:39.652
What the fuck?

20:39.818 --> 20:41.092
They aren't old, right?

20:41.153 --> 20:44.259
But they act like they're 80,
and from the '50s.

20:44.623 --> 20:47.035
I bet they have the nastiest sex!

20:48.026 --> 20:50.233
Wait. Did you guys hear that?

20:50.629 --> 20:52.302
What are you talking about?

20:52.364 --> 20:55.038
Kim, this totally looks like you!

20:55.300 --> 20:57.746
You're, like, a hot milkmaid.

20:58.870 --> 21:01.510
They definitely have the nastiest sex.

21:01.640 --> 21:05.247
My cousin's a Sunday school teacher
and she loves anal.

21:05.310 --> 21:07.586
I really don't think I'm hearing things.

21:07.646 --> 21:09.626
You're so gross.

21:09.681 --> 21:10.785
You started it.

21:10.849 --> 21:12.795
This bed is like a freaking cloud.

21:12.851 --> 21:14.797
I don't think it's a good idea for us
to take a nap here, Ava.

21:14.853 --> 21:17.026
Hey, you totally had sex with that old guy

21:17.089 --> 21:19.626
just 'cause he had, like,
a Tempur-Pedic mattress.

21:19.691 --> 21:21.432
Okay, he wasn't old.

21:21.860 --> 21:24.067
- Old.
- He was pretty old.

21:24.196 --> 21:26.142
He was 49. That is not old.

21:26.364 --> 21:28.970
- That's so old.
- It's old even for me.

21:33.438 --> 21:35.179
Stop talking to me.

21:36.675 --> 21:38.450
She's done it again.

21:38.710 --> 21:40.383
This is beautiful.

21:40.612 --> 21:42.148
Just beautiful!

21:42.380 --> 21:46.829
How lucky we are that you have access
to these old family recipes, Betty.

21:50.922 --> 21:53.198
So, you guys have a tire?

21:55.894 --> 21:57.601
For the van! Yes, sure.

21:57.662 --> 21:59.573
The boys will fix that up for you.
Won't you, boys?

22:04.436 --> 22:06.541
Sorry, are these your sons?

22:07.105 --> 22:08.448
You look so young.

22:10.142 --> 22:12.383
You just made Bunny's year with that one.

22:12.444 --> 22:13.923
Actually, we adopted the boys.

22:14.646 --> 22:17.752
It's a long, sad story.

22:19.484 --> 22:21.054
Let's give thanks.

22:24.956 --> 22:27.300
O Divine One,

22:27.359 --> 22:31.967
we offer our gratitude for this beast,
for this blood,

22:32.998 --> 22:34.671
for these vessels of anew.

22:34.733 --> 22:38.442
We bow to you, for You are all-knowing.

22:38.503 --> 22:42.542
We offer ourselves to you,
for You are the Master.

22:44.576 --> 22:45.748
Amen?

22:48.914 --> 22:51.793
What exactly is in this dish?

22:51.883 --> 22:53.362
It's a Sunday roast.

22:54.653 --> 22:58.328
I probably should have mentioned before
that I don't eat meat.

23:00.659 --> 23:01.865
I see.

23:03.094 --> 23:08.009
You know, there are some who just
don't have the luxury to not eat meat.

23:09.301 --> 23:11.406
Only the strong survive! Right, boys?

23:14.539 --> 23:17.713
- So, are you guys Russian or something?
- Russian?

23:18.677 --> 23:20.748
That is a good one!

23:20.812 --> 23:23.588
No, Raymond and Bunny, they're just,

23:24.249 --> 23:27.492
very traditional,
set in their ways, as are we!

23:28.019 --> 23:32.434
But it is no matter. Everything's fine.
You don't have to eat the meat.

23:32.490 --> 23:35.096
- No.
- It's actually really good.

23:37.095 --> 23:38.335
It is!

23:39.030 --> 23:40.873
I thought there was four of you.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.240
Enough!

24:22.207 --> 24:25.711
This place feels like a bad acid trip.
Those twins?

24:26.878 --> 24:29.620
What the fuck was that prayer all about?

24:29.681 --> 24:31.183
Why do you have to be so negative?

24:32.784 --> 24:33.990
Seriously?

24:34.719 --> 24:35.925
Yeah.

24:36.121 --> 24:38.431
- So we got a flat.
- What the fuck.

24:38.490 --> 24:43.337
We're here. We got a roof over our head.
We got free dinner.

24:44.129 --> 24:46.268
What's the big deal?

24:46.331 --> 24:48.777
Why can't you just make the best of things?

24:50.168 --> 24:53.581
I don't know,
because we have a show to play tomorrow?

24:54.072 --> 24:57.679
And we're stuck in some house
in the middle of nowhere

24:57.742 --> 25:00.484
on some road that doesn't seem to exist?

25:00.712 --> 25:05.559
Sorry if I'm being a bummer by pointing
this out, but this isn't exactly normal.

25:11.356 --> 25:13.336
Nothing's ever your fault.

25:14.225 --> 25:15.863
- What?
- Nothing.

25:16.661 --> 25:17.935
Just...

25:19.497 --> 25:21.374
Miss Alex, that's all.

25:24.202 --> 25:27.081
If she were here,
everything would be different.

25:27.806 --> 25:29.911
Yeah, so do I. Obviously.

25:30.175 --> 25:32.519
Then why did you let her leave?

25:32.744 --> 25:34.382
What did you say?

25:36.982 --> 25:39.121
You let her leave that night.

25:40.485 --> 25:45.833
You wanted to fuck some nobody asshole
in some shithole club.

25:47.392 --> 25:49.463
I hope it was good.

25:50.261 --> 25:53.071
I hope it was really good.

25:57.302 --> 25:59.248
Why are you doing this right now?

25:59.404 --> 26:02.408
You know that I loved her more than any...

26:02.507 --> 26:04.043
It's not funny, Kim!

26:04.576 --> 26:06.749
You should see your face right now!

26:07.012 --> 26:09.993
What the fuck, man? That's so messed up!

26:10.048 --> 26:12.528
All right, I didn't make her
leave that night.

26:12.584 --> 26:17.658
It's not my... My God! My God!
Okay, I'm gonna get you a towel!

26:22.427 --> 26:23.497
Jesus.

26:25.330 --> 26:26.707
Hey! They're really sick!

26:26.765 --> 26:29.644
Ava and Kim can't stop throwing up this,
like, black stuff all over the place.

26:29.701 --> 26:30.873
We have to do something.

26:30.935 --> 26:34.246
Dear. It's probably the meat.

26:35.006 --> 26:36.349
Newcomers!

26:36.408 --> 26:39.480
Well, the first time is the worst time.

26:39.544 --> 26:41.421
What is in that meat? What is going on?

26:41.479 --> 26:43.015
I've got just the thing.

26:43.081 --> 26:46.221
They'll be fine as soon
as they get some medicine.

26:46.284 --> 26:47.661
Nice play!

26:59.964 --> 27:03.969
Thank you so much.
This medicine's wonderful.

27:04.102 --> 27:05.342
Of course, darling.

27:06.971 --> 27:09.417
See? All better now.

27:09.474 --> 27:12.114
Are you sure you don't want to change
into something more comfortable?

27:12.177 --> 27:13.952
Yeah, I'm sure, thank you.

27:14.546 --> 27:17.550
- Shouldn't we be calling a doctor, though?
- Don't you worry.

27:18.083 --> 27:20.188
Dale knows what he's doing.

27:20.618 --> 27:22.256
Old family recipe.

27:23.388 --> 27:24.594
Yeah, from the Old World?

27:24.656 --> 27:27.227
Yes, young lady, from the Old World.

27:28.760 --> 27:32.435
But I swear,
if I could market this, I'd be rich.

27:36.568 --> 27:38.343
Sleep tight.

27:45.276 --> 27:46.721
Guys, we have got to go!

27:46.778 --> 27:49.156
You need to calm down.

27:49.214 --> 27:54.789
Let's just get some sleep, then Pete
or the boys can come fix our van.

27:55.320 --> 27:59.530
What? No. No, no, no. We go take their tire
and we get on the road. I will pay for a hotel.

27:59.858 --> 28:01.895
I'm not going anywhere.

28:02.694 --> 28:04.401
How would we even get to the van tonight?

28:05.763 --> 28:07.401
I'm going to bed.

28:07.932 --> 28:10.105
I'm so, so sleepy.

28:12.537 --> 28:15.211
How are you guys acting
like nothing is wrong right now?

28:15.273 --> 28:17.184
I wish Alex was here.

28:19.310 --> 28:21.119
I know. Me, too.

28:22.213 --> 28:23.749
But she's dead.

28:23.848 --> 28:26.658
I wish Sadie was a better friend to Alex.

29:57.575 --> 30:00.283
I had more faith in you than that.

30:03.448 --> 30:05.826
Why'd you leave me?

30:13.091 --> 30:14.399
My God!

30:25.770 --> 30:27.374
Let us rejoice!

30:28.139 --> 30:29.447
Let us rejoice!

30:29.774 --> 30:31.651
Hear now this creed!

30:32.477 --> 30:36.357
Contentment thou shall find
through suffering

30:36.848 --> 30:39.124
and through long years in it.

30:39.751 --> 30:42.664
For the damned do not grow old.

30:42.787 --> 30:47.736
Their minds are nourished by living
in the dark waters of the gods.

30:48.593 --> 30:50.095
Knowest thou.

30:50.428 --> 30:52.908
Thou has begun thy transition.

30:54.332 --> 30:56.972
Thou has begun thy transition.

30:58.703 --> 31:00.910
Thou has begun thy transition.

31:02.774 --> 31:05.186
Thou has begun thy transition.

31:06.511 --> 31:09.685
Thou has begun thy transition.

31:11.983 --> 31:15.453
The damned do not grow old.

31:15.687 --> 31:17.530
Thou has begun thy transition.

31:17.922 --> 31:22.166
The damned do not grow old.

31:22.226 --> 31:25.537
Thou has begun thy transition.

31:25.596 --> 31:28.099
Thou has begun thy transition.

31:28.166 --> 31:30.009
Thou has begun thy transition.

31:43.648 --> 31:45.753
Sadie.

31:47.018 --> 31:48.224
Hi, Sadie.

31:52.657 --> 31:54.227
Don't be a baby.

32:09.841 --> 32:11.377
Sadie.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.292
Sadie.

32:28.526 --> 32:30.403
Sadie.

32:44.609 --> 32:49.217
You left me there to die.

32:50.882 --> 32:53.089
Now we can all be together.

33:26.184 --> 33:27.185
Hey!

33:28.786 --> 33:29.890
Black.

33:29.954 --> 33:32.127
Black. Pink, black.

33:32.690 --> 33:34.567
I like pink. Go with pink.

33:34.625 --> 33:35.968
Of course you do.

33:36.027 --> 33:38.439
Well, you look great in it.

33:39.330 --> 33:42.311
- You want to wear the black, I know.
- Of course I want to wear the black!

33:42.433 --> 33:43.537
I...

33:55.947 --> 33:57.620
Now, where were we?

33:57.682 --> 33:58.717
Lucas, what just happened?

33:58.783 --> 34:02.629
Seems I lost my train of thought.
Well, folks, the mind is a tricky demon.

34:02.687 --> 34:03.757
Lucas?

34:03.821 --> 34:05.232
I'd say all you...

34:05.289 --> 34:06.359
Lucas, are you okay?

34:06.757 --> 34:07.963
I gotta call you back.

34:08.025 --> 34:11.130
...keep on moving forward.

34:11.195 --> 34:14.404
Try not to linger
on the things you left behind.

34:14.931 --> 34:17.503
Because you cannot undo
what's been done...

34:18.402 --> 34:20.404
And ain't nobody gonna...

34:35.920 --> 34:38.491
Hello? Hey! Are you okay?

34:39.422 --> 34:40.766
Miss, I...

34:53.871 --> 34:55.110
Hi, hey.

34:55.505 --> 34:57.281
Lucas, are you okay?

34:57.475 --> 34:58.681
Yeah.

34:58.743 --> 35:00.086
God damn it, don't do that to me.

35:00.144 --> 35:01.919
All I heard was this god-awful
screeching sound.

35:01.979 --> 35:04.687
I thought you were, like,
getting attacked or something.

35:04.749 --> 35:08.390
When are you coming home already?
When are you coming home?

35:09.287 --> 35:11.233
Baby? Talk to me.

35:13.124 --> 35:16.071
Lucas? Babe, what's up?

35:20.298 --> 35:23.939
Honey, I gotta call you back, okay?
I'm sorry. I love you.

35:32.743 --> 35:35.747
- 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
- Yeah, I just hit a woman with my car.

35:35.813 --> 35:40.057
You just hit a woman with your car...
With your car. Was she on foot?

35:40.117 --> 35:44.896
Yes. She's in the road right now,
and she's very badly hurt.

35:44.956 --> 35:46.765
- Okay.
- She's very badly hurt.

35:46.824 --> 35:48.360
Okay, we got it. Where are you right now?

35:48.426 --> 35:49.427
I'm on...

35:51.362 --> 35:53.239
I'm on... I don't know where I am.

35:53.297 --> 35:54.901
You know what,
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

35:54.966 --> 35:56.946
Sir, I'm sorry, sir, you're breaking up.

35:57.001 --> 35:59.538
I said I'm in the middle of nowhere.

36:02.073 --> 36:03.143
What do I do?

36:03.207 --> 36:06.154
Okay, sir, I can't send an ambulance
if I don't know where you are.

36:06.210 --> 36:07.518
Is there a cross street?

36:07.578 --> 36:10.286
No. There's some lights up ahead.

36:10.348 --> 36:13.591
I think there's a town
a few miles ahead? I'm...

36:13.651 --> 36:15.927
So there's a town. Can you tell me
anything about where that...

36:16.020 --> 36:18.296
I can't find it on my GPS. I'm sorry.

36:18.422 --> 36:20.595
Okay, I'm patching you through
to Emergency Medical. One moment.

36:20.658 --> 36:22.035
Okay.

36:28.366 --> 36:30.812
Hello? Can you hurry up, please?

36:30.868 --> 36:32.643
Sir? Sir, it's okay. Are you there?

36:32.703 --> 36:34.649
Yes! Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

36:34.739 --> 36:37.151
I'm a certified EMT. Are you with her now?

36:37.241 --> 36:38.311
Yeah.

36:38.376 --> 36:40.617
Great. Can you describe
her condition to me?

36:40.678 --> 36:41.918
She's...

36:43.381 --> 36:45.657
She's got a head trauma,

36:45.716 --> 36:49.664
and some broken bones,
multiple broken bones, I think.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.256
Okay. Anything else?

36:52.957 --> 36:56.530
She's got a compound fracture of her knee.
I think.

36:56.694 --> 36:58.037
- Is she breathing?
- Yeah.

36:58.329 --> 37:00.832
- Okay. Is she conscious?
- God damn it, Claire.

37:00.898 --> 37:03.071
- All right, sir, you're doing fine. Sir?
- Yeah.

37:03.134 --> 37:05.011
Lucas? Lucas?

37:05.803 --> 37:07.077
How do you know my name?

37:07.138 --> 37:08.708
We have your cell.

37:09.573 --> 37:11.780
- Right. Of course. Yeah.
- You need to trust us, okay?

37:11.842 --> 37:12.912
Okay.

37:12.977 --> 37:15.651
Sir, she's in critical condition
and we can't seem to locate you,

37:15.713 --> 37:17.624
so we'd like you to try and move her.

37:17.715 --> 37:19.217
You want me to move her?

37:19.283 --> 37:21.923
You said there's a town up ahead, right?

37:30.227 --> 37:31.570
Okay.

37:33.664 --> 37:36.270
All right. Okay. You're okay.

37:47.645 --> 37:51.218
Okay. I've got her in the backseat.
We are driving.

37:51.282 --> 37:54.092
I am heading south. Are you still with me?

37:55.486 --> 37:58.023
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, we're here. Just stay with us, okay?

37:58.089 --> 37:59.397
You're doing just great, Lucas.

37:59.457 --> 38:03.337
There's a lot of cracks in the windshield.
I cannot see very well.

38:03.394 --> 38:06.204
- What am I looking for when I get there?
- We're gonna talk you through it.

38:06.263 --> 38:08.903
All right, good.
We're doing about 80 right now.

38:08.966 --> 38:11.173
I think I can go faster.
I'm gonna go faster.

38:11.235 --> 38:12.612
- Lucas?
- Yeah?

38:12.670 --> 38:16.709
Can you say something to her?
You know, in case she can hear you.

38:21.278 --> 38:23.451
I'll do everything I can.

38:28.886 --> 38:31.093
Lucas, tell us when you're close.

38:31.155 --> 38:33.157
- Okay, just got into town.
- Okay.

38:33.324 --> 38:34.997
Okay, there's shops.

38:35.059 --> 38:39.166
I see a barber shop,
I see there's a tattoo parlor, a church...

38:39.230 --> 38:41.870
Do you see any people?
Anyone on the side of the road?

38:41.932 --> 38:43.309
- Anyone that you can ask for help?
- No.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.107
No, I don't see anyone.
There's nobody. Not yet.

38:45.169 --> 38:46.204
What about the oncoming traffic?

38:46.270 --> 38:47.977
Can you flash your lights
at the oncoming traffic?

38:48.038 --> 38:49.847
No, no, I don't see anyone.

38:50.274 --> 38:52.311
There's no oncoming traffic,
or there's no people?

38:52.409 --> 38:54.218
- Okay, wait a minute.
- Okay. Lucas, you need...

38:54.278 --> 38:56.656
Wait, there's a sign up here.
Okay, it's a hospital sign.

38:56.714 --> 38:59.593
I think I'm pulling up
into a local hospital.

39:08.759 --> 39:11.501
Dispatch to Regional, he's located
a medical facility of some sort.

39:11.562 --> 39:13.940
Be advised, no contact local PD.

39:14.598 --> 39:16.544
Lucas, we'll stay with you
till you've made contact.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.479
Just make sure you stay with us until then.

39:19.603 --> 39:22.049
Help! I need some help!

39:24.708 --> 39:28.485
Hello? Hello, I have an emergency!

39:30.247 --> 39:32.227
Is there anybody here?

39:32.917 --> 39:36.194
Is there some sort of problem?
Did he run into a problem?

39:36.253 --> 39:37.288
Hello?

39:37.354 --> 39:38.856
Sir, is there a problem?

39:38.923 --> 39:40.766
Lucas, can you...

39:40.825 --> 39:42.930
...no one seems to know.

39:42.993 --> 39:45.564
But that experience must have been
a serious emotional shock.

39:46.330 --> 39:49.209
You think I imagined all of it, don't you?
You think I'm insane?

39:49.266 --> 39:51.837
I didn't say that. I don't mean that.

39:51.902 --> 39:53.939
What the fuck? Hey!

39:54.004 --> 39:55.677
...I'm not given to imagining...

39:55.739 --> 39:57.946
Sir, what's the problem here?

39:58.742 --> 39:59.982
We need you to talk to us.

40:00.044 --> 40:01.682
Lucas, we can help.

40:02.046 --> 40:03.992
Okay, okay, okay.

40:05.482 --> 40:06.517
Sir?

40:08.452 --> 40:11.262
Sir, we need you on the line
telling us what you see.

40:11.455 --> 40:14.595
We need you to keep talking to us. Sir?

40:14.859 --> 40:16.964
- There's no one here. It's...
- Okay.

40:17.027 --> 40:19.166
- It's abandoned or something.
- Okay. Calm down, sir.

40:19.230 --> 40:21.301
There's no one fucking here!

40:21.665 --> 40:25.306
Sir, I need you to calm down.
I'm sure there's someone nearby.

40:25.636 --> 40:29.345
I'm going to need you to find the nearest
surgeon, nurse, whoever you can find.

40:29.406 --> 40:32.546
- There's no one here. Do you understand?
- I need you to find the closest person.

40:32.610 --> 40:33.611
Okay, sir.

40:33.677 --> 40:35.281
I'm looking. I do not see anyone.

40:35.379 --> 40:39.293
Okay, how is the victim? How is the victim?

40:39.383 --> 40:40.521
I don't know what's happening.

40:40.584 --> 40:44.122
Lucas! What about the girl?
How's she doing?

40:54.398 --> 40:55.968
Shit! Fuck!

40:56.700 --> 40:58.407
Lucas, how's she doing?

40:58.469 --> 40:59.743
Not good!

40:59.803 --> 41:02.215
- Not good. Okay, what's happening?
- What?

41:02.806 --> 41:05.309
Her leg is... It's broken. It's...

41:05.376 --> 41:06.480
Okay.

41:06.543 --> 41:08.716
- She's bleeding really, really bad.
- All right.

41:11.215 --> 41:14.355
All right. Focus.
You need to stop the bleeding.

41:14.418 --> 41:16.398
I need you to look
for anything you can use.

41:16.453 --> 41:18.524
- Like a tourniquet?
- Yes.

41:18.589 --> 41:20.865
All right. I got it,
I got it, I got it. I got it.

41:20.925 --> 41:22.666
Now, wrap it around the leg.

41:23.494 --> 41:24.905
All right.

41:24.962 --> 41:26.566
Okay, how tight do I make it?

41:26.664 --> 41:28.769
- As tight as you can.
- Okay.

41:31.268 --> 41:33.714
Something's happening! All right.
She's moving, she's moving!

41:33.771 --> 41:35.808
- I don't know what to do!
- Sir, you need to focus.

41:35.906 --> 41:37.249
Well, then, tell what I'm supposed to do!

41:37.341 --> 41:39.514
Okay, Lucas, is she responsive?

41:39.743 --> 41:41.518
To what exactly?
I don't know what that means!

41:41.578 --> 41:42.886
How is her breathing?

41:43.814 --> 41:45.191
It's upsetting. She's...

41:45.249 --> 41:46.819
There's blood bubbling out of her mouth.

41:47.184 --> 41:48.288
He's losing her. He's losing her.

41:48.352 --> 41:50.195
I need to hear it!

41:53.791 --> 41:55.634
- Can you hear it?
- Yes!

41:56.794 --> 41:59.138
Okay, now listen carefully.
You're going to have to intubate her.

41:59.196 --> 42:00.436
Do you know what that means?

42:00.497 --> 42:01.942
Stick a tube in her throat.

42:01.999 --> 42:04.172
Exactly. Now, you want to find
a specific kit for that.

42:04.234 --> 42:07.306
It's pretty standard stuff,
but it's specific.

42:08.939 --> 42:10.816
- Lucas?
- Okay, what am I looking for?

42:10.874 --> 42:12.581
A package or a pack or a bag.

42:12.643 --> 42:15.681
Probably has an indicator on the front,
but it can vary in shape or size.

42:15.746 --> 42:16.884
What am I looking for?

42:16.947 --> 42:18.927
Okay, it's best just to look
for the word "intubation,"

42:18.983 --> 42:22.396
or "tracheal," "endotracheal,"
"tracheal intubation. " Any of those.

42:22.453 --> 42:25.024
Or "airway," "airway intubation,"
"airway management kit,"

42:25.089 --> 42:26.796
"EMS airway." That's the one we use.

42:26.857 --> 42:30.134
Anything that has those words on it.
Just tell me what you find.

42:30.194 --> 42:33.664
Lucas, tell me what you find.
Have you seen any?

42:34.264 --> 42:36.335
- Can you see anything that looks like that?
- Okay, I got it.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.847
Okay, good. First, open the kit,
look for the curved laryngoscope blade.

42:39.903 --> 42:41.576
It's a metal hand tool.

42:41.638 --> 42:43.208
No, there's no blade. It's just the tube.

42:43.307 --> 42:44.945
- It's just the tube.
- That's right.

42:45.009 --> 42:46.613
You're going to have to do it manually.

42:46.677 --> 42:49.817
First, identify the glottis. It's a little
fleshy valve at the back of her throat.

42:49.880 --> 42:50.915
Feel for the breath.

42:50.981 --> 42:52.517
You want me to stick my fingers
in her throat?

42:52.583 --> 42:54.256
Yes. You have to. It's the intubation.

42:54.318 --> 42:58.095
And have it ready.
You need to hurry, you need to do it now.

43:00.758 --> 43:02.431
Okay. Okay.

43:03.327 --> 43:06.365
All right. Okay. Okay.

43:10.667 --> 43:14.615
You must go farther, Lucas.
All the way to the back of the tongue.

43:17.541 --> 43:19.521
- Now do it.
- Okay.

43:19.710 --> 43:22.623
Insert the tube. Don't hesitate.

43:23.947 --> 43:26.223
Keep going. Keep going.

43:27.084 --> 43:30.156
- Fuck! She's biting me! She's biting me!
- What happened?

43:30.220 --> 43:31.631
She's...

43:32.756 --> 43:34.360
- What's happening?
- Something's wrong.

43:34.425 --> 43:35.870
She's close to death.

43:35.926 --> 43:37.166
Who is this?

43:39.329 --> 43:41.366
Hello? Who is this?

43:41.432 --> 43:44.709
I'm a surgeon, Lucas.
I've been listening since you arrived.

43:44.768 --> 43:46.645
- Okay.
- He's here to help.

43:46.737 --> 43:48.717
Do you want to save her life?

43:49.306 --> 43:50.341
Yes.

43:50.407 --> 43:53.388
Then whatever you do,
do not remove your hand from her throat.

43:53.444 --> 43:56.914
Trust me, the tube is not set
and it's the only thing giving her oxygen,

43:56.980 --> 43:59.290
the only thing keeping her alive.

43:59.349 --> 44:01.226
But it's also killing her.

44:01.285 --> 44:03.287
She's got several broken ribs
on her right side

44:03.353 --> 44:06.596
and the diaphragm is unable
to compress the lung. She can't breathe.

44:06.657 --> 44:07.863
You must compress the lung.

44:08.659 --> 44:10.570
- How do you know that?
- You must compress the lung.

44:10.627 --> 44:11.662
I didn't tell you that.

44:11.728 --> 44:13.139
You must compress the lung.

44:13.230 --> 44:16.040
No, no, no, look, I need a minute here.
I'm not really sure what I...

44:16.100 --> 44:17.170
Compress the lung.

44:17.234 --> 44:20.272
I must compress the lung! I must...
Fine, what the fuck does that mean?

44:20.337 --> 44:23.216
First, use your free hand
to expose the rib cage.

44:24.541 --> 44:26.885
Okay. Okay.

44:28.145 --> 44:31.126
- Okay. Now what?
- Slowly. Carefully.

44:31.181 --> 44:33.525
- You can do this, Lucas.
- Now what?

44:33.617 --> 44:35.255
Make an incision.

44:37.154 --> 44:39.464
- An incision?
- Make an incision.

44:39.857 --> 44:41.200
You have to.

44:42.993 --> 44:44.063
All right.

44:52.136 --> 44:54.047
Okay. Okay.

44:54.304 --> 44:56.284
You have the blade.

44:56.340 --> 44:59.446
Five to seven inches.
Just below the rib cage.

45:03.413 --> 45:04.721
Slowly.

45:05.916 --> 45:07.020
Slowly.

45:08.819 --> 45:09.889
Slowly.

45:14.658 --> 45:15.693
Okay.

45:16.593 --> 45:18.504
- Find the lung.
- Okay.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.550
I got it.

45:38.882 --> 45:40.691
Compress the lung.

46:46.250 --> 46:47.558
Fuck!

46:50.554 --> 46:51.658
Fuck!

47:22.786 --> 47:24.197
What the fuck?

47:24.321 --> 47:25.322
What the fuck?

47:26.690 --> 47:27.725
Fuck!

47:33.864 --> 47:35.502
Fuck! Fuck!

48:54.277 --> 48:55.312
Claire?

49:02.586 --> 49:04.588
- Claire's not here.
- We're still on.

49:04.654 --> 49:07.726
We're going to have
to talk about this, Lucas.

49:08.158 --> 49:09.967
I don't deserve this.

49:10.994 --> 49:12.166
Really?

49:13.964 --> 49:15.944
Why don't you elaborate?

49:16.800 --> 49:18.040
Elaborate.

49:21.638 --> 49:26.485
She was out in the middle of the road,
in the middle of the fucking night,

49:26.543 --> 49:28.819
in the middle of nowhere.

49:28.879 --> 49:32.019
How am I supposed to be expect...
I mean it's...

49:33.984 --> 49:37.329
It's an extraordinary circumstance, okay?
How am I supposed to be...

49:37.387 --> 49:38.661
Lucas, it's okay.

49:38.755 --> 49:40.632
Absolutely okay.

49:40.857 --> 49:42.029
Right. Right.

49:42.092 --> 49:44.333
- You had no way of knowing.
- No way of knowing.

49:44.428 --> 49:46.999
She was in the middle of the road,
in the middle of the fucking night...

49:47.063 --> 49:49.600
- In the middle of nowhere.
- At night.

49:49.766 --> 49:52.508
It doesn't have to be your fault, Lucas.

49:53.003 --> 49:54.812
Go be with your wife.

49:56.907 --> 49:59.012
I can just walk out of here?

49:59.342 --> 50:00.446
- Yes.
- Yes.

50:00.510 --> 50:01.921
- Yes.
- Yes.

50:02.078 --> 50:03.489
I can leave?

50:03.547 --> 50:04.651
- Yes.
- Yes.

50:04.714 --> 50:05.749
Yes.

50:06.817 --> 50:08.558
And you aren't tricking me again?

50:08.618 --> 50:09.653
- No.
- No.

50:09.719 --> 50:11.289
- No.
- No, Lucas.

50:12.155 --> 50:13.964
Find the locker room.

50:14.124 --> 50:15.467
You'll see.

52:23.486 --> 52:27.059
Do I need to worry about what's back there?

52:27.424 --> 52:29.062
- No.
- No.

52:29.659 --> 52:31.195
Absolutely not.

52:33.129 --> 52:34.904
You were never here.

52:37.767 --> 52:38.939
Okay.

52:42.439 --> 52:44.385
I'm hanging up now.

52:49.112 --> 52:50.853
That's good, Lucas.

52:55.452 --> 52:56.829
Good night.

54:14.431 --> 54:16.274
I'll take a beer and a shot of whiskey.

54:17.867 --> 54:19.574
You forgot to shut the door.

54:19.636 --> 54:20.944
No, I didn't.

54:21.504 --> 54:23.006
It didn't latch.

54:23.807 --> 54:25.286
Come on, Al.

54:25.341 --> 54:27.981
I been on my feet for hours.
Give me a beer.

54:31.281 --> 54:32.783
First the door.

54:32.849 --> 54:36.524
Seriously? It's shut. It's fine.

54:37.721 --> 54:40.224
Sounds pretty sure of herself, Al.

54:41.458 --> 54:46.840
At the same time, being sure is sort of
a fancy way of being lazy.

54:48.665 --> 54:50.440
You want to go check the door?

54:51.468 --> 54:52.811
I mean...

54:54.337 --> 54:57.443
You can see from here
it's not shut all the way.

55:01.044 --> 55:02.819
I'll buy you a beer.

55:03.580 --> 55:06.561
Well, when you put it like that...

55:08.685 --> 55:10.995
All right, everybody,
put your hands on the tables!

55:11.554 --> 55:13.864
Cooperate and we'll get this over with
real fuckin' quick!

55:13.923 --> 55:16.426
- You! Sit the fuck down!
- Hang on, buddy.

55:16.526 --> 55:18.233
Put your hands on the table.

55:19.896 --> 55:22.103
What the fuck part
of "put your hands on the table"

55:22.165 --> 55:24.577
is so hard for you to understand?

55:28.371 --> 55:31.875
Maybe before we all get carried away here,

55:31.941 --> 55:35.479
we stop and think for a minute.

55:35.812 --> 55:37.485
- How's that sound?
- That sounds great.

55:37.547 --> 55:41.154
Now, I know that one shitty bar
might look just like any other.

55:42.619 --> 55:44.064
But here's some free advice.

55:44.587 --> 55:48.899
Get back on whatever road it was
that brought you here and keep moving.

55:49.159 --> 55:51.230
'Cause I guarantee you

55:51.294 --> 55:53.205
that robbin' this place

55:53.530 --> 55:55.237
is way more trouble than it's worth.

55:55.298 --> 55:58.108
This is not a robbery!

56:01.905 --> 56:03.043
This is my sister.

56:05.608 --> 56:07.281
Her name is Jesse,

56:08.645 --> 56:11.148
and I know that she's in this town.

56:11.915 --> 56:13.986
Now, I don't want to hurt anybody.

56:14.050 --> 56:16.690
But I'm telling you right the fuck now,

56:16.753 --> 56:19.097
I'll do anything to find her.

56:19.155 --> 56:21.965
Put your fucking hands on the bar!

56:23.860 --> 56:24.930
Thank you.

56:26.596 --> 56:28.007
Anyone.

56:29.199 --> 56:30.837
Anybody seen her?

56:36.439 --> 56:37.816
Where'd you get that tattoo?

56:40.777 --> 56:42.586
Did you get that around here?

56:54.357 --> 56:55.495
Fuck!

57:06.369 --> 57:10.181
I don't know if I can kill you,
but I bet that it hurts like a motherfucker!

57:12.876 --> 57:15.015
One more step! One more fucking step!

57:23.887 --> 57:26.629
Last time. Have you seen her?

57:28.558 --> 57:29.559
Yeah.

57:30.493 --> 57:32.234
Yeah? Where?

57:32.395 --> 57:34.602
Nowhere you can go, big shot.

57:35.198 --> 57:37.269
You'll fucking take me!

57:40.637 --> 57:42.480
Move, motherfucker!

57:45.241 --> 57:48.711
Get in. Get in. And drive.

57:52.982 --> 57:54.222
Fuckin' go, man!

57:56.719 --> 57:59.290
Where are my road warriors at,

57:59.355 --> 58:02.598
my veteran road hogs out there
tearing up the pavement

58:02.659 --> 58:04.195
where the rubber meets the road?

58:04.260 --> 58:09.005
You may be an old dog,
but you can still learn some new tricks.

58:09.065 --> 58:10.635
So what's stopping you?

58:10.700 --> 58:12.907
You don't owe the world shit.

58:12.969 --> 58:16.212
It's time to live your own life,
and if someone's dumb enough to stand...

58:16.272 --> 58:19.344
You don't got a lot of time
before the whole valley finds out,

58:19.409 --> 58:21.286
but you know that, don't ya?

58:21.344 --> 58:24.382
Yeah. Yeah. If I need you to,
I'm gonna have you drive off the road.

58:24.847 --> 58:26.884
You don't want to do that.

58:27.283 --> 58:30.230
It looks like the desert,
but if you go out there,

58:30.286 --> 58:31.697
you might not come back.

58:49.739 --> 58:52.083
What the fuck are we doin' here?

58:53.042 --> 58:54.680
It's around back.

59:10.893 --> 59:13.032
- In there.
- In where? What?

59:13.896 --> 59:15.534
How do we get in?

59:18.301 --> 59:19.302
Through the door.

59:22.739 --> 59:24.650
Quit being so fuckin' mysterious!

59:32.248 --> 59:33.283
Sorry.

59:34.317 --> 59:35.660
That's okay, Danny.

59:38.321 --> 59:40.323
How did you know my name?

59:44.827 --> 59:47.398
You're fucked, Danny!

59:47.463 --> 59:48.771
And you don't even know it yet.

01:00:21.531 --> 01:00:22.771
Don't you want to see her?

01:00:26.502 --> 01:00:27.674
Yeah.

01:00:58.334 --> 01:00:59.369
Jesse!

01:01:01.471 --> 01:01:03.849
- Jesse, it's me, Danny.
- Danny?

01:01:04.841 --> 01:01:06.047
Danny, what...

01:01:09.345 --> 01:01:10.847
Are you really here?

01:01:10.913 --> 01:01:12.517
I'm really here.

01:01:16.586 --> 01:01:18.361
My God! You're hurt.

01:01:18.721 --> 01:01:21.668
It's nothing. It's nothing.
I can't believe I found you.

01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:23.335
How did you even get here?

01:01:25.128 --> 01:01:27.335
Man, Danny, you got old.

01:01:28.431 --> 01:01:31.241
I've been searchin' for you for 13 years.

01:01:32.502 --> 01:01:34.982
You look absolutely incredible.

01:01:35.271 --> 01:01:37.581
- Danny, wait...
- Yeah, what?

01:01:39.375 --> 01:01:41.480
- How did you get here?
- |...

01:01:44.147 --> 01:01:46.684
- No. Danny, don't!
- What the hell are you doing?

01:01:46.749 --> 01:01:48.160
What the hell are you doing?

01:01:48.217 --> 01:01:50.663
I'm savin' you!
I came to get you the hell outta here!

01:01:52.522 --> 01:01:54.126
Danny, I don't want to leave.

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:57.194
You don't mean that, Jesse.
Now get outta the fuckin' way.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.604
- She does mean it, Danny.
- Shut up!

01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:02.532
She's here because she wants to be.

01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:09.006
Come on, Danny.

01:02:09.438 --> 01:02:11.645
Okay? It's time for you to leave.

01:02:29.025 --> 01:02:31.062
- Danny!
- Come on.

01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:37.606
Get your fucking hands off of me!

01:02:38.467 --> 01:02:39.810
Turn us around.

01:02:41.003 --> 01:02:42.414
God damn it!

01:02:48.144 --> 01:02:49.487
You're such an asshole.

01:02:50.446 --> 01:02:51.948
I'm okay with that.

01:02:52.014 --> 01:02:54.119
Just let me be an asshole
and get you the hell out of here.

01:03:04.627 --> 01:03:05.799
Fuck.

01:03:08.364 --> 01:03:12.403
Danny, you're not supposed to go out there.

01:03:16.405 --> 01:03:19.045
If you do this, it's for you,

01:03:20.243 --> 01:03:21.847
it's not for me.

01:03:24.313 --> 01:03:25.656
I don't have a choice.

01:03:35.758 --> 01:03:36.998
I can't see anything!

01:03:37.426 --> 01:03:38.734
There's nothing to see!

01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:42.409
The fuckin' car's gonna fall apart.

01:03:42.498 --> 01:03:44.478
Don't slow down.

01:03:44.533 --> 01:03:46.843
You're not supposed to be here.

01:03:49.238 --> 01:03:52.185
You can't stay here,
and you can't take me with you.

01:03:52.241 --> 01:03:54.346
I'm not leaving you behind.

01:03:55.411 --> 01:03:56.913
You'll need your gun.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:58.915
What?

01:03:58.981 --> 01:04:03.020
You have the gun, Danny?
You might have to blow my brains out, too.

01:04:03.085 --> 01:04:04.189
Stop it!

01:04:04.253 --> 01:04:08.531
No, you can't stop!
You can't stop, Danny, it's too late!

01:04:09.091 --> 01:04:10.297
Fucking stop!

01:04:23.105 --> 01:04:25.051
- Fuck!
- Danny...

01:04:29.111 --> 01:04:32.115
This place is made for people like me.

01:04:32.181 --> 01:04:33.990
You shouldn't be here.

01:04:35.818 --> 01:04:40.324
I mean, this whole time growing up,
didn't you ever think about Mom and Dad?

01:04:41.624 --> 01:04:42.728
What do you mean?

01:04:42.792 --> 01:04:45.068
Come on, Danny, tell the truth.

01:04:46.095 --> 01:04:49.099
You've really never thought
it was my fault?

01:04:51.934 --> 01:04:53.345
You can't

01:04:53.869 --> 01:04:55.678
blame yourself for what happened.

01:04:55.738 --> 01:04:58.309
No, you're not listening
to what I'm saying.

01:04:58.974 --> 01:05:02.820
- You were a kid. We were... You were...
- I killed them, Danny.

01:05:06.949 --> 01:05:09.520
I killed them because I wanted to.

01:05:09.585 --> 01:05:13.032
All right? And now I'm here
because I want to be.

01:05:13.089 --> 01:05:16.935
This place found me and I love it here.

01:05:28.604 --> 01:05:31.050
Jesse, help me! Jesse!

01:05:39.582 --> 01:05:41.118
You should've let me go.

01:05:41.183 --> 01:05:43.390
I just wanted to save you.

01:05:45.721 --> 01:05:46.961
Jesse!

01:05:50.393 --> 01:05:51.667
Jesse!

01:06:48.284 --> 01:06:50.264
What are you lookin' at?

01:07:06.969 --> 01:07:08.346
How I'm looking forward to that.

01:07:08.404 --> 01:07:09.405
- Yeah.
- Hey.

01:07:09.472 --> 01:07:11.281
You can leave your stuff everywhere.

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.751
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, honey.

01:07:13.509 --> 01:07:16.251
I'm so glad that we got to do this
before you start school.

01:07:16.312 --> 01:07:19.623
- Me, too.
- Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

01:07:19.682 --> 01:07:21.593
We still have this one last weekend
to have fun.

01:07:22.084 --> 01:07:26.794
Play games and puzzles, make s'mores,
with our little girl.

01:07:28.023 --> 01:07:29.559
It's just exciting, sweetie.

01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:37.040
Well, we all know the past
can be a piece of shit sometimes,

01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:40.603
but when it catches up to you,
you'd better be ready.

01:07:40.669 --> 01:07:45.482
Keep your eyes on the road
and let that engine roar so loud

01:07:45.541 --> 01:07:49.387
that you can't hear those demons
screamin' in your ear.

01:07:49.445 --> 01:07:52.449
Lock your doors and make those tires burn.

01:07:52.515 --> 01:07:56.122
Tell your family you love them
and kiss the past goodbye

01:07:56.185 --> 01:07:58.756
once and for all,

01:07:58.821 --> 01:08:02.359
because every road
has got to end somewhere.

01:08:02.424 --> 01:08:03.903
Am I right?

01:08:27.216 --> 01:08:30.254
All right.
Sure looks better in the pictures.

01:08:30.719 --> 01:08:31.925
Got some charm.

01:08:32.787 --> 01:08:35.769
Listen, why don't you go unpack
and we'll have dinner ready in an hour.

01:08:35.823 --> 01:08:37.167
Cool.

01:08:37.859 --> 01:08:39.862
I'm gonna open some wine.

01:08:59.515 --> 01:09:01.756
Do you think she's ready?

01:09:02.117 --> 01:09:05.291
Of course not. Is anyone ever?

01:09:06.755 --> 01:09:10.669
At a certain point we're just going
to have to trust in the future, right?

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:15.536
I just hope that she'll learn
to believe in herself.

01:09:15.598 --> 01:09:18.408
And that she'll stand up for herself.

01:09:19.935 --> 01:09:21.209
She will.

01:09:22.738 --> 01:09:24.843
Question is, are you ready?

01:09:27.176 --> 01:09:28.746
I'll be fine.

01:09:39.354 --> 01:09:41.631
I did not say that.

01:09:43.058 --> 01:09:44.298
- That's a good idea though.
- Hey, honey.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:45.361
Hey.

01:09:47.429 --> 01:09:49.773
Hold on, honey, let your dad get it.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:53.608
This next one might be familiar
to some of you...

01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:54.875
Who is it?

01:09:54.937 --> 01:09:58.612
...who don't want the night to end.
So go ahead...

01:09:58.941 --> 01:09:59.942
Hello?

01:10:00.009 --> 01:10:03.582
Make some mistakes.
You can always get it right the next time.

01:10:23.399 --> 01:10:24.571
No one's there.

01:10:47.656 --> 01:10:49.033
What is it?

01:10:50.826 --> 01:10:52.601
- Honey, call the cops.
- What?

01:10:52.661 --> 01:10:53.935
Call the cops, now! Go!

01:10:54.163 --> 01:10:55.267
Okay.

01:10:55.664 --> 01:10:57.268
Dad, what is it?

01:11:00.035 --> 01:11:01.571
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

01:11:01.637 --> 01:11:04.311
- Someone's trying to break into the house.
- What's the address?

01:11:04.373 --> 01:11:06.182
It's 6-2-5-5 Bethel Lane.

01:11:06.241 --> 01:11:10.087
Okay, just take a deep breath.
We're going to be there in about 30 minutes.

01:11:10.145 --> 01:11:12.625
- What?
- You are gonna be fine.

01:11:18.454 --> 01:11:20.297
- Dad?
- Daryl?

01:11:20.556 --> 01:11:21.591
Dad?

01:11:26.862 --> 01:11:28.603
- It's gonna take 30 minutes.
- What?

01:11:29.398 --> 01:11:30.468
What?

01:11:33.736 --> 01:11:35.545
Dad, what's going on?

01:11:37.573 --> 01:11:40.110
We gotta get out of here. Come here.

01:11:58.494 --> 01:12:00.201
What do you want?

01:12:03.799 --> 01:12:05.437
What do you want?

01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:24.621
Jem! Jem!

01:12:42.538 --> 01:12:46.213
Why are they doing this?
What do they want from us?

01:12:52.447 --> 01:12:54.154
What about Jem?

01:14:47.963 --> 01:14:50.136
What the fuck do you want from us?
Please! What?

01:15:18.026 --> 01:15:21.371
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:22.097 --> 01:15:24.236
What are you talking about, baby?
What are you talking about?

01:15:24.299 --> 01:15:26.779
Listen, I'll give you anything you want,
anything you want, just please,

01:15:26.835 --> 01:15:28.678
let me know what I can do
to make this right, please.

01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:35.249
My God!

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.915
You told...

01:15:40.949 --> 01:15:43.691
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:45.454 --> 01:15:47.297
No, no! I will not... No!

01:15:49.691 --> 01:15:51.830
No! Cait! No!

01:15:52.594 --> 01:15:53.629
Cait!

01:15:56.031 --> 01:15:58.875
No! No! No!

01:15:59.234 --> 01:16:01.737
God! No, no!

01:16:02.304 --> 01:16:03.339
No!

01:16:09.277 --> 01:16:10.620
No!

01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:19.390
She was innocent.

01:16:19.721 --> 01:16:20.995
She was innocent!

01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:23.533
Just kill me!

01:16:26.395 --> 01:16:27.965
Jem! Go!

01:16:28.263 --> 01:16:30.243
Go! Go!

01:16:31.033 --> 01:16:32.068
Go!

01:16:32.901 --> 01:16:33.936
Go!

01:17:01.063 --> 01:17:02.269
Bitch!

01:17:15.744 --> 01:17:17.519
What do you want from us?

01:17:19.514 --> 01:17:21.050
What do you want from us?

01:17:22.884 --> 01:17:23.919
Go.

01:17:32.594 --> 01:17:33.595
Go!

01:17:56.118 --> 01:17:57.495
Thank you.

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.263
Thank you.

01:18:04.392 --> 01:18:06.201
Thank you. I'm so sorry...

01:18:07.629 --> 01:18:10.200
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:19:20.001 --> 01:19:21.878
Shane. Get up.

01:19:26.408 --> 01:19:27.944
A little help?

01:19:43.992 --> 01:19:44.993
Fuck!

01:19:51.466 --> 01:19:52.570
Fuck!

01:19:58.807 --> 01:20:00.309
We let you go!

01:20:10.885 --> 01:20:13.126
Fuck! You!

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.164
What've we done?

01:21:40.475 --> 01:21:42.045
What the fuck?

01:21:54.622 --> 01:21:57.466
Holy shit! Run!

01:22:04.466 --> 01:22:06.343
Mitch! Mitch!

01:22:20.515 --> 01:22:21.994
What the fuck?

01:22:36.264 --> 01:22:37.368
What the fuck?

01:22:58.319 --> 01:23:00.629
Un-fucking-believable.

01:23:14.502 --> 01:23:15.640
Fuck.

01:23:16.871 --> 01:23:19.647
- What about Shane?
- Fuck Shane. Shane was an ass...

01:23:26.347 --> 01:23:27.553
Fuck!

01:23:36.825 --> 01:23:38.361
What the fuck is that thing?

01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:43.173
Holy shit.

01:23:53.041 --> 01:23:54.577
Fuck this shit!

01:24:41.589 --> 01:24:43.091
Let's go home.

01:24:50.498 --> 01:24:53.911
Regret and remorse. Amends and atonement.

01:24:53.968 --> 01:24:55.709
Well, that's life, right?

01:24:55.770 --> 01:24:58.478
This next one is for you,

01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:02.545
for all you lost souls racing down
that long road to redemption,

01:25:02.610 --> 01:25:05.386
and all you sinners running from your past

01:25:05.446 --> 01:25:09.792
but heading straight
into that pit of darkness up ahead.

01:25:09.851 --> 01:25:12.322
We're all on the same endless highway,

01:25:12.387 --> 01:25:14.958
The one with no name, no exits

01:25:15.023 --> 01:25:18.436
looking for a way out of tonight,
and into tomorrow.

01:25:18.493 --> 01:25:21.838
Well, they're gonna try to stop you,
but you gotta say, "Fuck it,"

01:25:21.896 --> 01:25:24.934
and keep moving
because this is your highway.

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:30.973
And today might just be the day you
finally outrun those wicked demons

01:25:31.039 --> 01:25:32.950
once and for all.

01:25:33.007 --> 01:25:36.580
And I'll be right here with you
making sure you get where you're going.

01:25:37.011 --> 01:25:41.559
Because in the end, we're all
just trying to find our way home.

01:25:42.317 --> 01:25:43.455
Right?

01:25:44.485 --> 01:25:45.896
Rough night?

01:25:49.657 --> 01:25:50.795
Yeah.
