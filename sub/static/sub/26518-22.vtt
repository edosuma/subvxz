WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:10.625
Hey. Coordinating
with the field office.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.113
The National Guard's
being called in.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.298
It's all hands on deck.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.549
What do you got
for me?

00:14.640 --> 00:15.992
The team is on their way
back from NYIOC,

00:16.015 --> 00:17.202
but traffic's
a little backed up

00:17.226 --> 00:19.078
- over the impending fall of civilization.
- Mm-hm.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.289
It's like the Northeast blackout
of 2003 all over again.

00:21.313 --> 00:23.020
That's great!
We fixed that one.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.438
How did we fix that one?

00:24.525 --> 00:25.793
Well, that was just caused
by some errant wires

00:25.817 --> 00:27.024
and loose tree branches.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.190
This is a dedicated cyberattack
on the control center

00:29.238 --> 00:30.399
of the U.S. power grid.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.258
How long until we have
to undo this Helios attack?

00:32.281 --> 00:34.569
Kinda depends on your
definition of "undo."

00:34.660 --> 00:36.151
Got Internet and cell
towers jammed up

00:36.245 --> 00:37.736
and people rioting
in the streets.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.749
If those towers come down,
we're lookin' at about

00:39.790 --> 00:41.952
two weeks until society
crumbles, but...

00:42.042 --> 00:43.374
...only 96 hours

00:43.460 --> 00:44.871
until we run out
of reserve power.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.124
That's nationwide.
That's total grid failure.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.456
I mean, on the plus side,
look, it's isolated

00:49.550 --> 00:50.985
to the Eastern Interconnection,
so we're looking pretty...

00:51.009 --> 00:53.092
O Canada!

00:53.178 --> 00:55.340
Okay, the Quebec
Interconnection is down,

00:55.430 --> 00:57.342
so this is ongoing
and escalating.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.472
I need you to find out
who is doing this, right now.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.430
- It's Kathy.
- What?

01:01.520 --> 01:03.637
She's working for Madeline.
She's hacking the grid.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.847
Let's cause some chaos.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.732
- Are you sure?
- 100 percent.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.713
Weller unlocked Dominic's
phone at the crime scene.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.320
There's not much on there but
a super encrypted Helios file.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.818
Oh, and some
very thirsty texts,

01:14.908 --> 01:16.274
and if you scroll
a little further,

01:16.368 --> 01:17.449
some rather
intimate photos.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.013
Stop scrolling!
I need you two to find Kathy.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.637
I'm gonna take another crack
at Madeline,

01:20.706 --> 01:22.586
- along with everybody else.
- Okay.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.037
Where is everybody else?

01:27.504 --> 01:29.621
We said
no more secrets.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.798
- What are you talkin' about?
- I called Hirst.

01:31.883 --> 01:35.047
Weitz falsified evidence
and droned an American citizen

01:35.137 --> 01:37.615
- on American soil...
- Whoa, whoa, Reade. Keep your voice down.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.301
You knew about it
and you did nothing!

01:39.391 --> 01:40.451
It's not what
it looks like.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.715
It's exactly
what it looks like.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.101
You made a deal with Weitz, huh?
You keep his secret,

01:44.187 --> 01:45.769
he keeps Jane's?
Or should I say Remi's?

01:45.856 --> 01:47.518
I was protecting
all of us!

01:47.608 --> 01:49.600
All of us aren't married
to a terrorist!

01:49.693 --> 01:50.809
Enough!

01:50.902 --> 01:53.019
Hey, hey, hey!

01:53.113 --> 01:55.480
Hey! Hey!

01:55.574 --> 01:57.657
Somebody want to explain
to the FBI director

01:57.743 --> 02:01.612
why his FBI team is fighting
in an FBI locker room?

02:01.705 --> 02:03.349
It's just the job.
It gets to us every now and then.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.534
We're blowin' off steam.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.648
We all got the same text from...
What is this phone number?

02:10.672 --> 02:12.233
It's not a phone number.
It's a bank account.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.418
It's a ransom note.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.090
Kathy's not just
helping Madeline

02:15.177 --> 02:16.988
take down the power grid.
She's holding it hostage.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.423
We should get to the lab.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.846
Yeah.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.467
- Hey...
- Oh.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.927
What?

02:27.898 --> 02:29.560
Are we good?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.141
Your secret's safe.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.911 --> 02:42.597
...should just tell him.
Okay, if it doesn't...

02:42.621 --> 02:44.362
Forget it.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.164
Uh, we know how
to find Kathy.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.366
Great!
How'd you do it?

02:48.460 --> 02:49.562
You traced her text
to Dominic?

02:49.586 --> 02:50.747
You traced
her ransom text?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.419
No, those are deeply
encrypted.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.150
It's gonna take a little time
to crack that.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.461
But, um,
we have some plans.

02:56.551 --> 02:57.792
I have a plan, in particular.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.886
It's a bit of a swing,
so just keep an open mind...

02:59.971 --> 03:01.382
Just tell me the plan.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.637
It's all blue skies here.
There's no bad ideas.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.513
We pay the ransom.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.354
Next plan.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.666
No, we just dribble
a little bit of bitcoin

03:09.690 --> 03:11.147
- into an account...
- Next!

03:12.192 --> 03:15.151
We reach out to Kathy.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.820
How? I thought
we can't trace her.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.444
Yeah, we...
we can't trace her texts,

03:20.534 --> 03:24.778
but we can trace
the phone number

03:24.871 --> 03:27.534
that she gave to us
when we met up with her...

03:27.624 --> 03:29.991
...a few days ago.

03:30.085 --> 03:33.578
Patterson! Rich!
I'm getting married.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.289
Are you serious?

03:37.175 --> 03:38.336
You lied to me?

03:38.427 --> 03:39.884
Hey, if we hadn't
met with her,

03:39.970 --> 03:41.239
we wouldn't have gotten
her phone number

03:41.263 --> 03:42.824
and we would be able
to track her right now.

03:42.848 --> 03:43.908
That's valid.
If you arrested her

03:43.932 --> 03:45.639
when she hacked
into New England National,

03:45.726 --> 03:47.161
she wouldn't be attackin'
the grid right now.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.830
- I know, I'm just saying...
- Okay, we're all making good points...

03:48.854 --> 03:50.832
Okay,
okay, guys.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.848
- Unbelievable!
- Guys, guys, guys, stop!

03:52.941 --> 03:54.477
We don't have time for this.
I need you

03:54.568 --> 03:56.170
to reach out to Kathy
before this gets any worse.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.672
Oh, wait, that doesn't
look suspicious.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.483
The day she decides
to hack the power grid,

03:59.573 --> 04:00.717
her two cop buddies
just decide

04:00.741 --> 04:02.482
to call her up for a chat?

04:02.576 --> 04:05.159
What if it's not us
who reach out?

04:16.589 --> 04:18.627
<i>Oh, lovey!</i>

04:18.716 --> 04:20.583
<i>I've been so worried
about you.</i>

04:20.677 --> 04:21.838
<i>Did you get my texts?</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:23.088
Are you sure
she can't see us?

04:23.138 --> 04:24.549
Oh, yeah, we're good.

04:24.639 --> 04:25.783
I created a Deepfake
video for Dominic

04:25.807 --> 04:27.326
so it looks like
his phone is buffering

04:27.350 --> 04:28.590
and freezing
with glitchy sound.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.975
Oh, so like
a regular video call.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.886
Got her.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.721
Her phone
is pinging the Wi-Fi

04:33.815 --> 04:36.603
at the Perlan Museum
in Reykjavik, Iceland.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.900
Doesn't even make
any sense.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.443
Yes it does.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.486
She must be way the hell
underneath it.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.092
There's a rumor on the dark web
that the Perlan

04:43.116 --> 04:45.261
is sitting on a secret
cryptocurrency mining operation.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.618
See, the geothermal conditions
in Iceland make it ideal

04:47.704 --> 04:49.056
for cooling servers
that are burning off

04:49.080 --> 04:50.821
that much energy.
"The more you know..."

04:50.916 --> 04:52.953
Okay, so she must
be down there

04:53.043 --> 04:54.659
using the crypto farm's power

04:54.753 --> 04:56.022
to maintain the hack
on the grid.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.163
Right.
Let's fire up the jet.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.088
No-no-no-no,
take it easy, hold on.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.652
Gotta let Icelandic
authorities handle this.

05:01.676 --> 05:02.916
This has got to be above board.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.380
We haven't got time
for red tape.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.178
What if they can't be trusted?

05:06.264 --> 05:07.366
I'm still dealing
with the fallout

05:07.390 --> 05:08.676
of our last
unsanctioned op.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.036
Do you know
the political nightmare

05:10.060 --> 05:11.847
that Peru was?
Let alone Tokyo!

05:11.937 --> 05:12.973
The body count alone!

05:13.063 --> 05:15.771
Okay, what if we promise you
zero body count this time?

05:15.857 --> 05:17.769
That's expected all the time!

05:17.859 --> 05:20.567
I've seen the virus.
I know how it works,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.065
and I know how
to shut it down.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.591
I might be the only
person in the world

05:23.615 --> 05:24.947
who can stop this attack.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.151
This is our case,
so if we win, you win.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.158
Okay... I will
talk to Madeline,

05:31.248 --> 05:32.892
because we need to find out
why she's doing this.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.999
If you are gone
when I am done,

05:35.085 --> 05:37.168
then I don't know
where you are.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.667
- Get it?
- Got it.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.042
Let's move.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.795
Okay... Oh, not you.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.343
You've got an encrypted
Helios file to crack.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.932
Madeline.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.246
Please forgive me.
I did not mean

05:53.270 --> 05:54.664
to make you wait in here
for so long,

05:54.688 --> 05:57.522
but we're having
a bit of a... situation.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.751
Why don't you tell me
about this attack?

05:59.818 --> 06:02.105
What do you want?
Because we both know it's not money.

06:03.530 --> 06:07.695
I want you to stop accusing me
of things I didn't do.

06:08.660 --> 06:13.780
50 years, and it's just
business as usual around here.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.831
First it's J. Edgar Hoover
and my father,

06:15.917 --> 06:18.751
now it's you and me.
I mean, nothing changes.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.795
Maybe it just
all needs to end.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.796
Okay, I'll bite.
What needs to end?

06:27.470 --> 06:29.382
The FBI.

06:48.116 --> 06:52.656
So, are we gonna talk about
the elephant in the room, or...

06:52.746 --> 06:54.703
No?
No one?

06:54.789 --> 06:57.122
Just gonna have a quiet,
tension-filled

06:57.208 --> 06:59.541
flight to Iceland.
Cool. Cool.

07:01.046 --> 07:04.255
Look, I don't condone
what Weitz did either.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.254
But I do believe that Weller
kept it quiet out of love.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.505
That's the problem.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.882
Maybe this team needs
a little less love

07:10.972 --> 07:12.634
and a little more
accountability.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.223
Hey, crack that
Helios thing yet?

07:18.313 --> 07:20.726
- Working on it.
- I need you to dig into Madeline again.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.647
Wha... What do you
need me to do?

07:22.734 --> 07:24.712
Oh, she's saying this cryptic,
vague stuff about her father,

07:24.736 --> 07:26.523
and it's not
the first time.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.382
I'm in the middle of something.
You can't "Ask Jeeves"?

07:28.406 --> 07:30.238
Put your lab techs on it.
You know, delegate.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.157
Okay-okay-okay-okay.
"Jeeves."

07:33.119 --> 07:34.781
I gotta commend you,
Director.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.849
Transferrin' my client here
in the middle of the night

07:36.873 --> 07:38.614
under the cover
of darkness, no less.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.227
Pretty slick move.
And that's comin' from a guy

07:40.251 --> 07:41.437
who can appreciate
the slick move.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.730
But you gotta get up
pretty early

07:42.754 --> 07:44.245
to get ahead
of ol' Shirley.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.317
I've been up since... well,
I don't really sleep anymore.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.548
Do you have kids?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.500
Sorry, have we met?

07:49.594 --> 07:52.678
Oh, boy!
Here we go.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.596
Forgive me, Director.
I've been poring

07:54.683 --> 07:56.720
over your file so long,
I forgot we haven't met.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.346
Richard Shirley, Esquire.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.850
Shirley Gervais Karlie Hohua
Cicino Reynolds and Booth.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.932
Big merger in the news.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.187
- You're Madeline Burke's lawyer.
- Yes, sir.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.838
And I have a change
of clothes for my client.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.256
Should we go ahead and get
set up in the conference room?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.112
Uh, wait, sorry,
set up for what?

08:11.199 --> 08:13.191
Oh, phew!
You made it.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.868
These folks are from the DOJ.
And this is Lucas Nash,

08:16.955 --> 08:18.662
Director of
National Intelligence.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.286
Have you had the chance to meet
your new boss?

08:21.376 --> 08:23.413
Yes.
Congratulations, sir.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.119
Also, not my boss.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.500
No, but I do brief the president
every morning, so... hmm.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.209
Hmm. Shall we all get to work
exoneratin' my client now?

08:31.302 --> 08:33.043
Director.
Uh, Director.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.682
Wh... What do you mean,
exonerate your client?

08:38.768 --> 08:40.648
Well, some disturbing
allegations have been made

08:40.687 --> 08:42.269
against the FBI's
New York office,

08:42.355 --> 08:43.436
and more specifically,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.003
the team that arrested
Madeline Burke.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.023
My agents and my colleagues

08:47.110 --> 08:48.226
at the Department
of Justice

08:48.319 --> 08:49.560
want to get
to the bottom of it.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.482
So, where is your team right now,
Director Weitz?

08:56.327 --> 08:57.738
Right now, exactly?

08:57.829 --> 08:59.866
Yes. Are they
in the building?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.788
Their job is
to combat terrorism,

09:01.875 --> 09:05.084
so I suspect they're
probably out doing that.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.036
What about Rich Dotcom,
is he in the building?

09:07.130 --> 09:09.463
Maybe he's in Iceland
with the rest of the team?

09:10.008 --> 09:11.670
I know a gal
at the airport.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.628
She said an FBI jet
just left for Reykjavik?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.257
He could be in Iceland,

09:16.347 --> 09:17.867
if that is where
the attack originated.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.803
So, to be clear,

09:19.893 --> 09:22.806
this is not an operation
that you sanctioned.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.055
No, I did not
sanction an operation

09:26.149 --> 09:29.313
to or in Iceland.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.234
Do they always skirt
the chain of command,

09:31.321 --> 09:33.358
or just since
you've been in charge?

09:33.948 --> 09:36.031
What the hell is
the right answer to that one?

09:36.117 --> 09:38.279
We don't want the right answer.
We want the truth.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.364
Ah, there she is.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.951
Perhaps it's time we let
my client have her say.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.661
So we can all
get to the truth.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.554
Just want to give you
fair warning.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.183
We have a job to do,
but when it's done I'm goin' after Weitz.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.691
You do realize that
taking down Weitz

10:11.778 --> 10:14.771
means taking down Jane.
It compromises all of us.

10:14.864 --> 10:18.073
We've been compromised, Kurt,
for a really long time now.

10:20.662 --> 10:24.827
Directors...
I know your time is valuable,

10:24.916 --> 10:26.578
so I'll get right to the point.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.160
I am innocent.

10:29.254 --> 10:33.794
I was set up by the FBI.
By a team with a vendetta

10:33.883 --> 10:36.125
against me, my family,

10:36.219 --> 10:40.179
and my now-dissolved company,
HCI Global.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.349
This FBI team has killed
innocent civilians.

10:43.434 --> 10:46.017
They've caused
a catastrophic blackout.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.640
And now they have fled
the country.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.768
These rogue agents
have a history

10:50.859 --> 10:55.103
of violent
and self-serving behavior.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.564
The Kurt Weller I knew

10:58.658 --> 11:00.695
would never put himself
above the law.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.572
We've fallen so far
ever since

11:02.662 --> 11:04.870
all these tattoo cases
came into our lives.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.663
You mean ever since
I've shown up.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.115
Tell me I'm wrong.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.703
They killed Hank Crawford
in cold blood.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.255
They killed his daughter,
Blake,

11:18.344 --> 11:20.256
and HCI Global board members.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.348
What to do about you.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.016
Why?

11:26.102 --> 11:28.014
Because they crave power,

11:28.104 --> 11:29.720
and they sought
to gain control

11:29.814 --> 11:32.898
of one of the most powerful
companies in the world.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.477
They planted Tasha Zapata
in HCI Global

11:36.571 --> 11:40.440
in an effort to oust me
by killing those closest to me.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.322
She killed Kira Evans.
She killed Claudia Murphy.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.075
She made it look
as if I was a terrorist

11:47.165 --> 11:49.999
by orchestrating an attack
on Air Force One.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.747
And when I wouldn't confess
to these crimes,

11:52.837 --> 11:55.079
her team tried
to leverage a confession

11:55.173 --> 11:56.709
by fear and coercion.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.633
I will make sure that
you rot in prison.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.586
You make it sound
like it's black and white.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.216
- It's not.
- Yes, it is.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.890
You just don't get it
'cause you're not real FBI.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.434
No, I just show up and save
your life from time to time.

12:09.520 --> 12:14.106
The rest of us swore an oath
that we break over and over.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.669
Look at us.
Look at the company we keep.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.276
Rich Dotcom's rap sheet
speaks for itself.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.104
There sure are
a lot of criminals

12:20.198 --> 12:21.655
consulting for the FBI
these days.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.232
Whoa!
That's not cool,

12:23.326 --> 12:25.033
because Rich isn't here
to defend himself.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.280
Fine.
Let's talk about

12:26.371 --> 12:28.112
the little hacktivist group
you started.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.949
And you've heard of the "Three Blind Mice"?

12:31.042 --> 12:33.455
If you think this blackout
is the first time

12:33.544 --> 12:36.662
that Agent Patterson
has caused digital chaos,

12:36.756 --> 12:38.543
you'd be very wrong.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.966
Your partner Kathy
is waging cyberwar

12:41.052 --> 12:42.384
on the U.S. power grid
right now

12:42.470 --> 12:44.031
- because you let her go.
- Hey!

12:44.055 --> 12:45.921
Look who's finally done
looking the other way!

12:46.015 --> 12:47.756
Okay!
Enough.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.308
We are going to
stop Kathy together.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.476
As a team.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.225
Failed drug tests.
Data breaches.

12:54.315 --> 12:58.150
Unsanctioned ops.
Undocumented fiancés?

12:58.236 --> 13:00.193
Makes me wonder
who else knew.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.738
All the higher-ups,
or just the team?

13:02.824 --> 13:04.176
You're gonna sit here
and talk about team

13:04.200 --> 13:05.441
after everything you pulled?

13:05.535 --> 13:07.401
See, I knew it.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.363
I knew that you could
never forgive and forget.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.073
Forget you watching
Madeline murder people

13:13.167 --> 13:14.624
while you covered it up
for her?

13:14.711 --> 13:16.122
Oh, just like
I did for you?

13:16.212 --> 13:17.703
<i>And I just stood there</i>

13:17.797 --> 13:19.379
<i>and let him choke
on his own blood.</i>

13:19.465 --> 13:21.127
We gotta
get out of here.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.503
What does that mean?

13:26.597 --> 13:28.008
What did you do for him?

13:28.099 --> 13:29.840
I guess that
means that we're not

13:29.934 --> 13:32.096
the only ones
hiding secrets.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.973
And what about
Special Agent Kurt Weller?

13:34.564 --> 13:37.352
He was on track to become
the next FBI director

13:37.442 --> 13:40.401
when he mysteriously
decided to stay in the field.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.820
Why?
Does he like killing people?

13:43.906 --> 13:45.613
- Objection.
- This is not a trial.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.986
If Kurt Weller
isn't a killer,

13:47.076 --> 13:48.863
then how did
so many bullets

13:48.953 --> 13:50.990
from his personal
firearm end up

13:51.080 --> 13:52.946
in the bodies of so many
innocent people?

13:56.669 --> 13:57.910
I got it.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.126
I have the ballistics
report here,

14:06.220 --> 14:09.133
as well as phone data linkin'
him to the murder sites.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.516
- We're not as moral as we think we are.
- Maybe you're not.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.954
- I know who I am.
- No, you don't.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.595
None of us do.
At least not anymore.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.976
But the most disturbing
thing about Kurt Weller

14:19.067 --> 14:21.059
is that he married Jane Doe.

14:21.152 --> 14:24.816
Or was it Remi Briggs?
Or Alice Kruger?

14:24.906 --> 14:26.216
So, you don't think
people can change?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.572
No.
They don't change.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.650
People just become
more like themselves.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.785
And I don't like
who we've become.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.080
And did Jane Doe
and Kurt Weller

14:35.166 --> 14:38.534
mastermind a plot
to infiltrate the FBI

14:38.628 --> 14:41.120
and hide behind its integrity

14:41.214 --> 14:43.706
and wield its power
for their personal gain?

14:43.800 --> 14:46.713
These rogue agents
only care about themselves,

14:46.803 --> 14:48.635
and anybody
that gets in their way,

14:48.721 --> 14:50.337
that person is eliminated.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.672
Hmm.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.977
Well, I must admit,
I didn't want to believe

14:57.063 --> 14:59.225
<i>that such a high level
of corruption</i>

14:59.315 --> 15:02.524
<i>could be found in our
most trusted institutions.</i>

15:02.610 --> 15:04.772
<i>I want you to call
the Icelandic minister,</i>

15:04.862 --> 15:07.104
<i>and I want your team arrested
when they land.</i>

15:07.198 --> 15:10.282
And then I want you
to find Rich Dotcom.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.786
Give me the Icelandic minister.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.755
<i>I'll hold until she comes on.</i>

15:28.094 --> 15:30.211
This is so not good.

15:34.809 --> 15:37.973
Okay.
Okay, we can salvage this.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.179
We've gone through
a lot together.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.481
Too much to keep saying things
that we can't take back.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.524
And... we're family.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.351
We're not family!

15:46.446 --> 15:49.109
We work together.
That's it.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.900
Jane is my family.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.578
<i>Rich, what's going on?</i>

16:00.668 --> 16:01.875
We're all getting arrested.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.293
<i>- What?</i>
- Nash is here.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.790
He's put out an all-agency alert.

16:04.881 --> 16:05.983
<i>We're being blamed
for the attack.</i>

16:06.007 --> 16:07.623
What are you talking about?

16:07.717 --> 16:09.208
<i>Madeline's secret Helios plan</i>

16:09.302 --> 16:10.342
is a frame job against us,

16:10.386 --> 16:12.173
and it worked.
I gotta go!

16:15.850 --> 16:17.933
It says we're working
with Dominic

16:18.019 --> 16:19.226
to cause the blackout.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.804
And we killed him,
to be our fall guy?

16:21.898 --> 16:23.208
There's a video
of Patterson and Rich

16:23.232 --> 16:25.315
paying Kathy
to hack the power grid.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.358
She must have been
secretly recording us.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.311
Tell me you didn't
give her any money.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.113
It was for her wedding!
As a bribe.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.199
Okay, we can fix this.
As soon as we land in Iceland...

16:38.289 --> 16:40.030
We will be arrested on sight.

16:40.124 --> 16:43.037
I say we cut and run.
Get new identities.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.709
Disappear.
Not forever.

16:44.795 --> 16:48.209
Long enough to come back
and clear our names.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.256
No, there's no
coming back from this.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.209
Not as FBI agents, anyway.

16:52.303 --> 16:55.421
We need to finish this mission
while we still can.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.723
We know who's doing it.
We know where she is.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.300
If we don't at least
try and stop her,

17:00.394 --> 17:02.351
we're just making
more selfish choices.

17:03.648 --> 17:06.310
Even if I agreed with that,

17:06.400 --> 17:07.935
how the hell
we gonna do that?

17:19.829 --> 17:21.412
We jump.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.412
Oh, come on.

17:30.675 --> 17:31.675
What are you doing here?

17:31.759 --> 17:33.500
Wait a second,
how'd you know where I was?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.545
Cameras everywhere,

17:36.639 --> 17:38.075
and this is an empty room
with a vent.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.465
Where else are you gonna be?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.300
Listen to me.
You are being framed.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.056
You need to get outta here.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.373
This is the only building
in the city

17:44.397 --> 17:45.558
with enough computing power

17:45.648 --> 17:47.184
to decipher
Dominic's encryption.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.607
If I can crack
the Helios file,

17:48.693 --> 17:50.379
- I can clear everybody's name.
- No, no, no, listen.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.484
You need to get that phone

17:51.571 --> 17:52.589
and get out of here
while you still can.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.729
The tide has turned.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.860
It's every man
for himself.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.567
Totally. Okay, you're right.
I'll go.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.493
Live to fight another day.
You get it.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.038
We're the same,
you and me.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.125
Good luck.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.710
Okay, uh, one of Rich's
dark web friends

18:12.800 --> 18:14.086
is gonna meet us
on the ground.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.758
Okay, so can we trust
this guy or not?

18:15.845 --> 18:17.507
TBD!
His name is Ice Cream

18:17.597 --> 18:19.259
and he's friends with Rich,
so...

18:19.348 --> 18:21.243
- Five-to-one he sells us out.
- What about the pilots?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.579
- They're gonna know we jumped.
- But they won't know where we're landing.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.811
- It's now or never.
- Let's go!

20:02.118 --> 20:04.781
Okay! So, Kathy
is all the way

20:04.870 --> 20:06.953
over there
at the Perlan Museum.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.405
We sneak in as tourists,

20:08.499 --> 20:10.161
make our way down
to the crypto floor

20:10.251 --> 20:11.708
using the employee
elevator.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.286
Getting into the elevator
is not gonna be the problem,

20:14.380 --> 20:16.542
getting off requires a password.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.339
And that is where
Ice Cream comes in.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.042
So, he's gonna hack
the elevator?

20:20.136 --> 20:21.446
No, he's gonna
give us the password

20:21.470 --> 20:23.132
'cause he helped
design the system.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.967
Stay sharp.
We got company.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.927
That Ice Cream?

20:30.020 --> 20:31.977
I don't think so.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.445
<i>Hello, hello!
I'm sorry I got held up.</i>

20:40.531 --> 20:41.612
<i>I hope you don't mind.</i>

20:41.699 --> 20:44.191
<i>I sent some friends
to bring you to me.</i>

20:44.285 --> 20:45.446
We haven't got time
for that.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.097
All right? We need
the elevator password now.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.784
<i>I know this wasn't the plan,
but this whole thing</i>

20:49.874 --> 20:51.240
<i>came together
pretty last minute.</i>

20:51.333 --> 20:55.452
<i>I don't usually do biz
with people I don't know.</i>

20:55.963 --> 20:57.499
Rich said
he vouched for us.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.206
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:59.300 --> 21:02.668
<i>Rich Dotcom vouched
for you, exactly.</i>

21:02.762 --> 21:04.628
<i>Look, my password,
my rules.</i>

21:04.722 --> 21:05.722
<i>Your choice.</i>

21:07.099 --> 21:08.340
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

21:08.434 --> 21:11.268
<i>So, this is Vala.</i>

21:11.353 --> 21:12.889
<i>As a show of good faith,</i>

21:12.980 --> 21:15.723
<i>she has the coordinates
for a safe house</i>

21:15.816 --> 21:17.273
<i>in case this all
goes to Hell which,</i>

21:17.359 --> 21:19.191
<i>if I'm being honest,
is highly likely.</i>

21:19.278 --> 21:21.861
<i>I'm assuming you left
your phones on the plane,</i>

21:21.947 --> 21:25.440
<i>so Vala has new ones
for all y'all.</i>

21:25.534 --> 21:27.446
<i>See you soon!</i>

21:31.665 --> 21:33.281
Thank you.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.616
We have to divide and conquer.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.167
One team goes
to meet Ice Cream

21:36.253 --> 21:37.539
to get the password.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.041
The other team goes
to the Perlan

21:39.131 --> 21:40.292
to get ready to use it.

21:40.382 --> 21:41.860
Patterson, Jane and I
will do the elevator.

21:41.884 --> 21:43.796
Reade and Tasha,
you go get the password.

21:44.512 --> 21:48.096
We have to trust each other,
just one last time.

21:48.182 --> 21:50.048
Okay?
Let's move.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.197
Okay, it's, uh...
it's pretty quiet over there.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.945
Just a bunch of tourists
coming and going.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.617
Probably waltz
right in the back door.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.569
Fine.
Just keep me updated.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.906
Tasha and Reade arrived
for the meet.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.366
Ice Cream's running late.
What did Rich say?

22:16.460 --> 22:17.460
Nothing good.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.037
The jet landed at KEF.
Everyone knows that we jumped.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.371
We need to go in now.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.048
No. It's too risky.
We don't have the password yet.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.341
We'll still have time
to get it

22:25.427 --> 22:26.863
once we're in the elevator.
If we wait,

22:26.887 --> 22:29.129
we may not get
into the building at all.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.974
All right. Let's go.

22:48.951 --> 22:52.945
Welcome!
Apologies for the runaround.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.155
I like to meet people
in person, you know?

22:55.249 --> 22:57.241
Make sure they are not cops.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.541
But we are cops.

22:58.627 --> 22:59.867
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but, you know,

22:59.920 --> 23:01.627
you're dirty cops.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.879
So, Dotcom says

23:03.966 --> 23:06.253
you need a p-word.
Happy to provide.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.505
I just need
a little something.

23:09.263 --> 23:10.263
What's that?

23:10.347 --> 23:11.838
The Gardner paintings.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.925
I know Dotcom and Boston
have them.

23:15.019 --> 23:17.727
You give me the paintings,
I give you the p-word.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.429
- Done.
- Nah.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.685
I'm gonna need to hear
Dotcom say it.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.877
I'm probably gonna
lose signal down there.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.114
It's okay, I'm getting
on the building's Wi-Fi.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.031
All we can do is wait.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.329
<i>Absolutely not!
Ice Cream, I told you</i>

23:57.353 --> 23:58.913
<i>the Gardner paintings
are off the table!</i>

23:58.938 --> 24:01.271
Uh, table's been reset,
my friend.

24:01.357 --> 24:03.519
Dessert forks and whatnot.

24:03.609 --> 24:04.920
Okay, I don't even know
what that means.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.171
This is why I left
the group chat,

24:06.195 --> 24:07.436
- you weirdo!
<i>- Rich!</i>

24:07.529 --> 24:08.690
They're on the elevator.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.421
- We're running out of time.
<i>- Okay, okay.</i>

24:10.491 --> 24:12.949
Um, can you take me
off the speaker, please?

24:14.119 --> 24:15.360
What?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.570
I don't have the paintings.

24:16.664 --> 24:17.871
<i>Boston was keeping them</i>

24:17.957 --> 24:19.309
<i>as a kind of get outta
jail free card,</i>

24:19.333 --> 24:20.644
but obviously he didn't
get out of jail free,

24:20.668 --> 24:21.749
so they're definitely gone.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.563
All right, it's all good, man.
It's gonna be great.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.648
I'm gonna put you
back on speaker.

24:24.672 --> 24:27.130
What? No, that's not
what I... Hey!

24:27.216 --> 24:28.856
<i>Okay, Ice Cream,
you drive a hard bargain,</i>

24:28.926 --> 24:30.133
<i>but you got yourself
a deal.</i>

24:30.219 --> 24:31.585
You're gonna love
the Vermeer.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.198
<i>Had me worried there, friend.</i>

24:33.222 --> 24:34.554
Bless, bless!

24:34.640 --> 24:36.802
This calls for a celebration.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.972
Oh, uh, but obviously,

24:40.062 --> 24:42.349
if Dotcom reneges on the deal,

24:42.439 --> 24:43.771
I'll have you all killed.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.224
Yes!

24:46.318 --> 24:48.059
Dream team!

24:48.153 --> 24:49.735
How 'bout that password?

24:54.034 --> 24:55.900
- Got it.
- Excellent.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.966
Clear.

25:12.970 --> 25:14.757
- How long do you need?
- Not long.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.179
I'm into the power grid.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.052
I just need to redirect
the energy flow

25:18.142 --> 25:19.508
and balance
the substations.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.892
- What?
<i>- Stop what you're doing right now!</i>

25:24.982 --> 25:27.190
Why?
I'm almost done.

25:27.276 --> 25:28.795
Whatever you are doing,
you're making it worse.

25:28.819 --> 25:31.061
London just went dark.
Paris too!

25:31.155 --> 25:32.396
That doesn't
make any sense.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.525
Everything
that I've typed

25:33.615 --> 25:35.948
should have stopped
this attack.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.152
- Unless...
- What?

25:38.245 --> 25:40.487
Kathy rigged the system
with macro keys.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.197
What's a macro key,
Patterson?

25:42.291 --> 25:44.499
<i>A series of commands
can be recorded and saved</i>

25:44.585 --> 25:46.688
<i>onto one key and then deployed
with the push of a button.</i>

25:46.712 --> 25:48.749
<i>- It's classic Kathy!</i>
- So, it looks like

25:48.839 --> 25:50.671
we turned this into
a global crisis?

25:52.509 --> 25:54.045
And we've done all of it
on camera.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.259
Okay, we're resetting the system.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.060
Once I erase
the macro keys,

26:05.147 --> 26:07.027
I can undo the attack
and we can get outta here.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.335
- Well, that's weird.
<i>- What's weird?</i>

26:09.359 --> 26:10.628
All the money's
getting moved around.

26:10.652 --> 26:11.938
All what money?

26:12.029 --> 26:13.236
<i>The money
that I dribbled</i>

26:13.322 --> 26:15.154
<i>into the ransom account as bait.</i>

26:15.240 --> 26:17.448
No! Weitz told you
not to do that, Rich!

26:17.534 --> 26:19.196
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
Are we all doing</i>

26:19.286 --> 26:20.777
<i>whatever Weitz says now?</i>

26:20.871 --> 26:22.112
Wait a second.
This is good.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.573
I can follow the bitcoin
through crypto exchanges

26:24.666 --> 26:26.407
and link the ransom
directly back to Kathy.

26:26.502 --> 26:27.959
That's how we clear
our names.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.911
Oh, no, never mind.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.247
The money just landed
in New England National Bank,

26:32.341 --> 26:35.254
<i>in personal accounts
owned by us.</i>

26:35.344 --> 26:37.256
- Wha...?
- How is that possible?

26:37.346 --> 26:39.115
Kathy must have opened the
accounts when she hacked the bank.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.533
<i>Do you know how
bad this looks?</i>

26:40.557 --> 26:42.674
Yes, I know how bad this looks!

26:42.768 --> 26:44.208
And it's looking worse
by the second.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.135
Iceland's finest
are almost on you.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.346
<i>You gotta get
out of there!</i>

26:47.439 --> 26:48.719
The blackout is still spreading.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.460
I... I can't leave until
I stop this attack.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.146
Now is not the time
to be a hero!

26:52.236 --> 26:53.797
<i>Hey, can you shut up
so I can finish this?</i>

26:53.821 --> 26:55.187
<i>Okay, fine, go ahead.</i>

26:56.490 --> 26:58.527
It's all right, Patterson.
You got this.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.990
- Done!
- Okay, let's go!

27:04.665 --> 27:06.531
Oh.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.491
Hey, see?
What did I tell you?

27:08.585 --> 27:10.451
My team is trying to stop
the terrorist attack.

27:10.546 --> 27:13.038
Let's not applaud them for lighting
a fire just to put it out.

27:17.594 --> 27:18.960
Okay, look,
I know this looks bad,

27:19.054 --> 27:20.386
but, you know,

27:20.472 --> 27:22.075
if you and I could have
a private conversation...

27:22.099 --> 27:24.136
We just found their
New England National account.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.933
Looks like they were
paid very well

27:26.019 --> 27:27.726
to cause this blackout.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.850
Your agents are done.
They're done.

27:29.940 --> 27:31.147
And if I were you,
I would take

27:31.233 --> 27:33.225
this opportunity
to distance yourself.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.310
Be on the right side
of history.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.191
You mean like you?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.260
- Um...
- We have reason to believe

27:40.284 --> 27:42.196
Rich Dotcom is still
in the building.

27:52.546 --> 27:53.982
You're never gonna
get away with this.

27:54.006 --> 27:57.044
Ooh! Sounds like
we're playin' cards up now.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.501
Here we go.
I think it's very cute

27:59.595 --> 28:01.632
how you keep looking
to Nash for help.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.213
Do you think he became

28:03.307 --> 28:05.890
the Director of National
Intelligence on merit?

28:06.435 --> 28:07.676
So you own Nash.
So what?

28:07.769 --> 28:09.977
- I can go over his head.
- But you won't.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.143
Because I own you, too.

28:14.776 --> 28:18.235
<i>You thought you could use
a drone to solve your problems.</i>

28:18.322 --> 28:19.608
<i>What do you want?</i>

28:22.159 --> 28:23.366
I don't know
what that is.

28:23.452 --> 28:24.818
Well, it sounds
like you used

28:24.912 --> 28:27.700
a secret drone program
to kill an American civilian

28:27.789 --> 28:31.328
in order to cover up the fact
that you falsified evidence.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.704
I admit to nothing.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.786
But it just sounds bad,
doesn't it?

28:34.880 --> 28:36.712
You should look into
one of these scramblers.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.039
They're expensive,

28:38.133 --> 28:41.376
but the peace of mind
is... priceless.

28:45.515 --> 28:46.881
Cops are closing in.

28:49.519 --> 28:50.930
Okay, Patterson,

28:51.021 --> 28:52.661
you go out using the back exit,
all right?

28:52.731 --> 28:53.791
We'll draw 'em to the front.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.084
No-no-no, we can't split up,
we have...

28:55.108 --> 28:57.065
We have to, all right?
Let's not argue.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.893
Just get us
the cash and passports.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.049
If it all goes well,
we'll meet you at the safe house.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.073
What if it doesn't?

29:02.157 --> 29:04.319
If we get jammed up,
you need to save yourself.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.867
As long as you're out there,
the rest of us have a chance.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.071
She's right.
Don't get caught.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.371
Not for us.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.416
And good luck.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.806
Hey! What are you
still doing here?

29:32.896 --> 29:34.103
I told you
to get out of here.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.500
Have you cracked
the Helios thing?

29:35.524 --> 29:36.524
I'm really close.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.975
- Okay, where is the phone?
- It's hidden.

29:39.069 --> 29:40.380
- Where?
- I don't think I should tell you.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.404
- I think it'd be better if you didn't know.
- Rich!

29:42.447 --> 29:43.967
That phone could contain
the only proof

29:44.032 --> 29:45.443
that Madeline
is behind this attack.

29:45.534 --> 29:46.803
I know I've been
a hard guy to trust,

29:46.827 --> 29:48.193
but you need to believe
in me ri...

29:49.913 --> 29:51.154
I found him!
He's right here.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.912
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.954
We're not gonna make it.
Back inside.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.709
Go.

30:24.114 --> 30:26.026
What are you doin'?
Takin' hostages?

30:26.116 --> 30:27.573
I'm buying Patterson some time.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.557
You heard what the lady said!

30:32.581 --> 30:35.039
Do what we say,
or we will kill you!

30:54.102 --> 30:55.468
What the hell
were you thinking?

30:55.562 --> 30:57.849
I was improvising.
We've both seen

30:57.939 --> 31:00.181
our fair share
of hostage situations.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.767
There's no reason we can't
work our way out of this one.

31:05.113 --> 31:07.947
Remember, you're
a dangerous criminal.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.195
Yes, I am.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.572
So keep an eye
on the hostages.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.741
This is Kurt Weller.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.999
I want you and your officers
to stay back.

31:22.089 --> 31:23.421
I want a helicopter,

31:23.507 --> 31:26.124
here to fly us
out of this country.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.756
And I want some food.
You guys hungry?

31:28.845 --> 31:29.947
Want some food?
What do you want?

31:32.015 --> 31:34.052
Pizza. All right?
They want pizza.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.678
New York style.

31:35.769 --> 31:39.979
And some of it
has to have vegan cheese.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.523
Yes, I'm serious.

31:46.780 --> 31:50.069
So... I think that
I bought us some time.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.900
How do we get out
of this mess?

31:59.376 --> 32:00.742
Hey! There he is.

32:00.836 --> 32:03.624
The American hero
who found Rich Dotcom.

32:03.713 --> 32:06.501
Nice play, Matthew.
But it is your last one.

32:06.591 --> 32:08.423
You are out of moves.

32:08.510 --> 32:09.946
Don't suppose your offer
to make me president

32:09.970 --> 32:11.177
is still on the table.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.380
I tried the carrot,
and you didn't bite.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.055
Now it's time for
the stick.

32:15.809 --> 32:17.175
What do you want?

32:18.728 --> 32:21.220
I'd like to apologize
to Madeline Burke

32:21.314 --> 32:23.055
on behalf of the FBI.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.608
Without Miss Burke,
her lawyer, Mr. Shirley,

32:25.694 --> 32:28.528
and the honorable
DNI Nash,

32:28.613 --> 32:32.027
these rogue agents...

32:32.117 --> 32:34.700
may have gone unchecked.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.994
<i>Despite being harassed,
falsely accused,</i>

32:37.080 --> 32:39.493
<i>and wrongfully imprisoned
for horrible crimes,</i>

32:39.583 --> 32:42.166
<i>Miss Burke never wavered
in her resolve</i>

32:42.252 --> 32:45.666
<i>or her efforts
to help the FBI.</i>

32:45.755 --> 32:47.608
Why is the helicopter
gonna take that long?

32:47.632 --> 32:49.123
<i>...responsible took great care</i>

32:49.217 --> 32:51.755
<i>in hiding their misconduct...</i>

32:51.845 --> 32:53.211
How long do we have?

32:53.305 --> 32:54.967
He didn't really tell me.

32:55.891 --> 32:58.554
This negotiator sounds young.
Nervous.

32:58.643 --> 32:59.975
Could be his first time.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.474
- So, he won't want it to go badly.
- No.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.355
But he might
screw it up.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.232
Let's just hope
that he's not a cowboy.

33:07.319 --> 33:11.905
And for that, I am deeply sorry.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.526
Thank you.
That is all.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.178
This is an ongoing investigation,
so there...

33:15.202 --> 33:17.194
No, there will be
no questions at this time.

33:17.287 --> 33:18.869
Thank you.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.635
What are you doing?
Move aside.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.368
Madeline Burke,
everybody.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.923
Thank you, Director Weitz.
And I might say,

33:31.009 --> 33:35.424
your commitment to your
current position is inspiring.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.723
And I'm deeply honored
that you've chosen me

33:38.808 --> 33:41.596
to lead your new
Civilian Oversight Committee.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.350
And as my first act
in that role,

33:45.440 --> 33:46.897
I would like to speak directly

33:46.983 --> 33:50.147
to these rogue agents
behind this vicious

33:50.237 --> 33:51.819
<i>and escalating crisis.</i>

33:51.905 --> 33:55.990
<i>Turn yourselves in,
end the carnage,</i>

33:56.076 --> 33:58.534
<i>before anyone else gets hurt.</i>

33:59.704 --> 34:01.070
Heads up.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.909
Gas!

34:26.106 --> 34:28.018
Hey, no...

34:28.108 --> 34:30.521
Buzzkill.
Your friends got caught.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.444
They took hostages.

34:33.530 --> 34:36.398
Okay, you said you can get us
anything we want, right?

34:36.491 --> 34:38.483
Can you get Icelandic
SWAT uniforms?

34:38.577 --> 34:41.411
Please, I can get you
Icelandic SWAT officers.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.953
For a price.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.266
We already promised you
the Gardner paintings.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.032
What else do you want?

34:48.085 --> 34:51.123
<i>Hi, hi!
Just hang tight, yo.</i>

34:51.214 --> 34:53.206
<i>Your friends have
got your back.</i>

34:53.300 --> 34:56.088
Now we just need Rich

34:56.177 --> 34:58.669
to crack that Helios file
and exonerate us.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.141
What do you want?

35:04.227 --> 35:06.122
Nash and his agents know
you've been helping the team,

35:06.146 --> 35:07.637
and they have
some questions for you.

35:07.731 --> 35:09.017
Well, you can tell

35:09.107 --> 35:10.598
the Director
of National Intelligence

35:10.692 --> 35:12.024
that I'm not talking.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.444
Oh, you will, but not here.
Take him to the boat.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.985
The... there's a boat?

35:22.162 --> 35:24.654
No, I think
you're wrong, Weitz.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.865
We're not the same.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.620
Oh,
you have to come back sometime

35:45.644 --> 35:48.011
when you have more time.
In the summer, it's beautiful.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.832
And, you know, not...
I mean, this is beautiful too.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.017
But, you know...

35:51.107 --> 35:53.315
It's not much,
but you'll be safe.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.231
Smugglers have used
these old shacks for decades.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.689
They're all interconnected
with these old tunnels.

35:59.783 --> 36:00.819
Very cool.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.866
Don't go down there.
They collapse all the time.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.693
Okay, so,
we're gonna jam.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.529
The boat will be here
in the morning.

36:06.623 --> 36:08.239
Peace, friends.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.075
Where's Patterson?

36:12.796 --> 36:13.981
- Hey!
- Hey!

36:14.005 --> 36:15.121
You guys made it.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.422
We were so worried about you.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.295
Please, I was
the first one here.

36:18.385 --> 36:20.627
- Yeah.
- You've got... a lot of leaves in your here.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.131
- Sorry.
- Well...

36:22.222 --> 36:24.339
I somehow fell into the...
the only bush in Iceland.

36:24.432 --> 36:25.432
Dogs chasing me.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.509
Had to wade through a stream
to lose the scent.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.059
It's a long, boring story.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.491
Civilian oversight, huh?

36:44.577 --> 36:46.489
What's next?
You'll run for president?

36:46.579 --> 36:49.572
No, but my father did.

36:49.666 --> 36:53.205
It didn't go well,
thanks to the FBI.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.332
He had one meeting
with J. Edgar Hoover

36:56.423 --> 36:58.710
and suddenly my father
withdraws from public life

36:58.800 --> 37:01.167
and becomes a ghost
around our house.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.467
Six months later...
he was dead.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.093
I found him.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.674
It was Christmas Eve.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.471
I'm sorry.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.224
The doctor said
it was depression.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.770
An accidental mixing

37:13.857 --> 37:15.814
of alcohol
and prescription drugs.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.483
But I always knew the truth.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.779
That meeting killed my father.

37:21.865 --> 37:24.903
The FBI killed my father.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.610
They ruined my family,
and they ruined me,

37:27.704 --> 37:31.038
so now I am going
to ruin the FBI.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.493
Madeline, the team
doesn't deserve this.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.546
What about their families?
What about their lives?

37:36.629 --> 37:39.872
They work for the FBI,
and you run it!

37:39.966 --> 37:41.798
Actions have consequences,

37:41.885 --> 37:44.377
and these are yours.

37:44.471 --> 37:46.383
Get out of my office.

37:53.146 --> 37:54.146
Okay.

37:58.234 --> 37:59.234
Joan Boe?

37:59.319 --> 38:00.526
I know. I'm sorry.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.023
I was in a hurry,
and I...

38:02.113 --> 38:03.695
I made a decision
in a pinch.

38:03.782 --> 38:07.492
And you also used
your real first name.

38:07.577 --> 38:09.318
Here... never mind
what I used.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.948
We need to talk
about what's next.

38:11.039 --> 38:14.157
'Cause it's not gonna be easy,
and there's no going back.

38:14.250 --> 38:18.335
We all made some
pretty selfish choices.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.462
And we just need
to be better.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.585
And we all need
to clear our names.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.213
And to do that,
to do good...

38:25.303 --> 38:27.303
we might need to do some things
that we don't like.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.550
Living in hiding,
living on the run...

38:29.641 --> 38:32.099
that means compromise,
that means sacrifice.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.472
But we can't lose ourselves
along the way.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.600
So, we need to swear
to each other right now.

38:38.358 --> 38:41.066
To do this together,

38:41.152 --> 38:42.359
or not at all.

38:43.613 --> 38:47.698
I just wanna say that
I was wrong earlier.

38:50.203 --> 38:51.910
We are family.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.409
And we're all we've got...

38:55.333 --> 38:58.917
So, I'm with you,
Patterson.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.289
No matter what.

39:01.923 --> 39:03.755
- Me too.
- Me too.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.003
To the end.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.755
To the bitter end.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.678
On that note,

39:09.764 --> 39:11.346
should we just get
some sleep?

39:11.432 --> 39:13.094
- Yes.
- I'm tired.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.846
Be back.

39:16.437 --> 39:18.269
Is anybody else nervous
about the favor

39:18.356 --> 39:20.063
Ice Cream is gonna ask for?

39:20.149 --> 39:21.936
I'm more worried
about Kathy.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.437
I just keep thinking about

39:23.528 --> 39:25.440
having to steal
the Gardner paintings again.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.238
Think that's a Rich Dotcom
Boston Arliss Crab problem.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.862
Or a Frank Rossi
Rebecca Johnson problem.

39:30.952 --> 39:33.410
You know what?
I said I was in a pinch.

39:33.496 --> 39:35.283
What'd you get, Kurt?

39:36.416 --> 39:37.873
Chet Hetson.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.451
- That could not be less believable.
- God.

39:40.545 --> 39:43.959
Hi, I'm Les Believable.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.290
Hey, you know what?
Next time, you can go

39:46.384 --> 39:48.104
get the fake names,
and I will sip champagne

39:48.136 --> 39:50.844
- with Mr. Cream.
- Okay, so...

39:50.930 --> 39:52.512
Bye, I'm gonna
take first watch.

39:52.599 --> 39:54.761
Oh, no, I'll go.

39:54.851 --> 39:55.932
I could use
some fresh air,

39:56.019 --> 39:57.476
unless Patterson
would like

39:57.562 --> 39:59.224
to spend more time
in the great outdoors.

40:01.149 --> 40:02.435
That couldn't be
less convincing.

40:02.942 --> 40:06.060
I'm Les Convincing.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.322
Hey, we should all get
matching tattoos after this.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.273
- Nope.
- Okay, I'm in.

40:11.367 --> 40:14.906

40:38.937 --> 40:40.849

40:40.939 --> 40:42.219
My team decrypted
a communication

40:42.273 --> 40:44.560
between Rich Dotcom
and a known associate,

40:44.651 --> 40:47.394
and we believe this man
is helping these rogue agents.

40:47.487 --> 40:48.853
How long for location?

40:48.947 --> 40:51.064
Moments.

40:51.157 --> 40:54.150
Uh, great,
let's call the minister

40:54.243 --> 40:55.596
and notify
the Icelandic authorities

40:55.620 --> 40:56.740
so they can move
on the team.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.529
When they have 'em, right?
Right?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.450
Do you wanna call 'em?
Should I call 'em?

41:02.543 --> 41:04.730
- Am I still in charge...?
- You can stand down, Director.

41:04.754 --> 41:07.747
I'm on line with DOD,
CIA, and the White House.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.376
We've been greenlit.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.878
Greenlit?
For what?

41:10.969 --> 41:12.631
Drone strike.

41:13.846 --> 41:15.087
No, no, you...

41:15.181 --> 41:17.013
Wait, they need
to be arrested.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.012
They need to be brought in
to stand trial.

41:20.228 --> 41:21.890
Location's up.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.499
I'm surprised to hear you say that,
director.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.435
I hear you're a big fan
of the drone program.

41:26.109 --> 41:28.726
We're the FBI,
we can't be killing FBI agents.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.652
Well, they're not FBI agents,
not anymore.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.525
And this is not
your responsibility.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.652
This is a DNI call,
so you can just rest easy.

41:36.577 --> 41:38.364
I can't stand for this.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.281
Location's locked.

41:47.213 --> 41:48.213
Green light.
