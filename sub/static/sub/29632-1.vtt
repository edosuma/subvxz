Keep pressure
on his wound.

02:10.029 --> 02:13.265
Keep going, guys. Go ahead
with the chest. Thank you.

04:59.164 --> 05:02.402
Miss Lewis, you know you're
not supposed to be in here.

05:12.845 --> 05:15.580
When did they check you in,
last night?

Travis!

05:41.205 --> 05:42.706
Would you mind, please,

05:42.708 --> 05:44.240
showing Miss Lewis
where her breakfast tray is?

05:44.242 --> 05:45.908
- I'd be glad to.
- Thank you so much.

05:45.910 --> 05:48.978
Travis... do you know
who was on last night?

05:48.980 --> 05:50.112
What the hell did they give her?

05:50.114 --> 05:52.114
I'm not sure.
I could check for you.

05:52.116 --> 05:55.085
- Right.
- Morning meeting's at 10:00.

05:55.087 --> 05:58.787
- Yeah. Who's in it?
- Dr. Morgan's here and...

05:58.789 --> 06:01.258
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:01.260 --> 06:04.727
Let me out of here!
Get me out of this place!

06:04.729 --> 06:07.597
What the hell am I doing on
this thing? I don't like this!

06:07.599 --> 06:09.131
Says she's hearing things
that aren't there.

06:09.133 --> 06:11.001
Threatening to kill herself.

06:11.003 --> 06:13.970
All right, Miss Russell,
I need you to try to calm down.

06:13.972 --> 06:15.205
You're not thinking too clearly.

06:15.207 --> 06:18.073
I am thinking
perfectly clearly!

06:18.075 --> 06:21.677
She is bleeding everywhere!

06:21.679 --> 06:24.213
She can't be here.
Take her down to Medicine.

06:24.215 --> 06:25.549
I'm sorry, Darcy.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.283
This is an emergency
psychiatric ward.

06:27.285 --> 06:29.785
We can only keep patients
for a short amount of time,

06:29.787 --> 06:31.754
when they're going
through an acute mental crisis,

06:31.756 --> 06:33.590
and then we have
to discharge them.

06:33.592 --> 06:35.191
I don't wanna go home.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.035
How are we doing, Anne?

06:48.073 --> 06:50.639
What do you think
about this guy in three?

06:50.641 --> 06:53.876
Is he calm? I was thinking
about taking the restraints off.

06:53.878 --> 06:56.912
Er... I wouldn't yet.
He's been asleep all morning.

06:56.914 --> 06:58.948
I say we wait
till the drugs wear off

06:58.950 --> 07:01.785
or he'll try to pull
his fingernails off again.

07:04.355 --> 07:09.059
...don't tell me anything!
I know you do not know me. No!

07:09.061 --> 07:12.761
Kevin Burke is back.
Should we restrain him?

07:12.763 --> 07:16.568
No, don't do that.
He's not a danger.

07:20.172 --> 07:22.241
OK, buzz me in.

07:23.874 --> 07:26.809
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

07:26.811 --> 07:30.583
No! Don't... Do not...

07:46.664 --> 07:49.032
You can't... you...

08:49.326 --> 08:53.328
Dr. Graham, there's a suicide
over at Metro Hospital morgue.

08:53.330 --> 08:54.430
Do you have time
to run over there

08:54.432 --> 08:56.366
and do an examination today?

08:56.368 --> 08:58.270
Sure, no problem.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.482
'That ends the rally
for the inning.

09:12.484 --> 09:15.418
'Three hits, one run,
no men left on base.

09:15.420 --> 09:19.325
'After eight,
we're still tied at two....'

09:48.152 --> 09:50.819
- You don't know?
- No, I don't know!

09:52.490 --> 09:54.491
Can I help you?

09:54.493 --> 09:58.026
Dr. Edward Graham,
medical examiner's office.

09:58.028 --> 10:00.829
Here to examine the John Doe
suicide reported last night.

10:00.831 --> 10:03.532
That's actually
what we were discussing.

10:03.534 --> 10:05.770
We have a problem.

10:07.505 --> 10:08.938
Good morning, Mr. Alan.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.507
How you doing?
Brought you some breakfast.

10:11.509 --> 10:13.008
Need to check your vitals,
though,

10:13.010 --> 10:15.878
and then you can eat everything
that you want.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.782
Let me see here...

10:22.420 --> 10:25.958
Hello? When were you assigned
to this room?

10:29.960 --> 10:32.161
Let's just get you up here.
Let's get you to sit up.

10:32.163 --> 10:34.299
Yeah, there you go. Good.

10:35.066 --> 10:36.435
Can you hear me?

10:39.970 --> 10:42.041
I'm gonna go get some help.

11:02.027 --> 11:04.797
Good morning. Well...

11:07.065 --> 11:10.102
- You found him here like this?
- Yes.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.578
Can you hear me?

11:21.580 --> 11:24.380
Do you know where you are, sir?

11:24.382 --> 11:27.617
I don't know, his lungs
are clear, his rhythm's good.

11:27.619 --> 11:32.124
Maybe he's off his meds. Look,
put a gown on him, call Psych...

11:34.492 --> 11:38.261
I've a good candidate
for residential treatment.

11:38.263 --> 11:41.231
- Who's this for?
- Patient is Kevin Burke.

11:41.233 --> 11:44.299
He has a history of
meth abuse, depression.

11:44.301 --> 11:46.069
I've seen him a few times
over the years.

11:46.071 --> 11:47.569
I think he's got a good shot at
getting clean this time, though.

11:47.571 --> 11:49.508
I really do.

11:52.244 --> 11:55.377
It says here that we already
gave him a shot last year.

11:55.379 --> 11:56.445
Yes.

11:56.447 --> 11:58.314
And he walked out
after a few days.

11:58.316 --> 12:01.184
But this is a window and we
should take it, I'm telling you.

12:01.186 --> 12:02.986
Daniel, when they
walk out like that,

12:02.988 --> 12:05.387
the hospital ends up paying
for the entire 30 days.

12:05.389 --> 12:06.555
Sarah, this is different.

12:06.557 --> 12:08.190
This man
had a significant break.

12:08.192 --> 12:10.626
Kevin is ready.

12:10.628 --> 12:14.264
Tell me,
where is Kevin Burke right now?

12:14.266 --> 12:16.869
Did you already admit him
into our unit?

12:18.202 --> 12:20.102
- Of course I did.
- Of course you did.

12:20.104 --> 12:22.005
It's temporary,
Sarah, till we can...

12:22.007 --> 12:23.473
Of course you did! Jesus!

12:23.475 --> 12:26.976
- ...get him into residential...
- Jesus, Daniel!

12:26.978 --> 12:28.511
Is he a danger to himself
or others?

12:28.513 --> 12:29.612
I put him on hold...

12:29.614 --> 12:32.615
Is he a danger to himself
or others?

12:32.617 --> 12:34.349
To look at our case load,
you'd think

12:34.351 --> 12:35.984
we're running
a drug rehab program.

12:35.986 --> 12:38.621
The floor's admittance rate
has gotten out of control.

12:38.623 --> 12:40.356
Do you even know
what we do here?

12:40.358 --> 12:41.991
We're the ones
who provide the drugs.

12:41.993 --> 12:43.025
The danger's not
treating the patients!

12:43.027 --> 12:44.193
Daniel...

12:44.195 --> 12:46.161
There's only one thing
you can do here

12:46.163 --> 12:48.997
and that's get them
a minute of clarity...

12:48.999 --> 12:51.233
We have gone over this,
Daniel...

12:51.235 --> 12:53.502
I know I can help,
and you won't let me do that.

12:53.504 --> 12:58.341
You're being way too comfortable
with me right now.

12:58.343 --> 13:00.476
I was gonna wait
to tell you this.

13:00.478 --> 13:01.577
For the time being,

13:01.579 --> 13:03.212
anyone admitted into our unit

13:03.214 --> 13:04.680
needs to be first
approved by me.

13:04.682 --> 13:07.282
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not.

13:07.284 --> 13:11.154
So, you're gonna personally
supervise every consult now?

13:11.156 --> 13:14.126
No... Just you.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.756
- Hey, Doc?
- Huh?

13:46.758 --> 13:49.492
Eval 1. John Doe.

13:49.494 --> 13:51.626
Nobody has any idea
where he came from?

13:51.628 --> 13:53.596
That seems to be the case.

13:53.598 --> 13:55.633
How's that even possible?

14:01.172 --> 14:03.207
Hi, I'm Dr. Forrester.

14:04.441 --> 14:06.477
Do you know where you are?

14:08.245 --> 14:09.981
Can you hear me?

14:27.731 --> 14:31.199
You know what's gonna happen
if we don't take him?

14:31.201 --> 14:34.237
Medicine's gonna put him in
a corner and forget about him.

14:34.239 --> 14:37.075
You can't think about that
around here.

14:48.585 --> 14:50.621
Sorry, what's that?

14:53.258 --> 14:56.358
I'm sorry.
Say that again, please.

14:56.360 --> 14:59.330
Mm-hmm.
How'd that make you feel?

15:00.697 --> 15:03.532
Yeah, I imagine so.
Did you hear that?

15:03.534 --> 15:05.267
- What?
- He spoke.

15:05.269 --> 15:06.769
- He did?
- Mm-hmm.

15:06.771 --> 15:10.540
He says he's suffering from
depression, suicidal thoughts,

15:10.542 --> 15:12.442
he's threatening self-harm.

15:12.444 --> 15:14.479
Isn't that what you heard?

15:15.713 --> 15:18.213
This man is an absolute danger
to himself.

15:18.215 --> 15:19.848
I'm admitting him on a 5150.

15:19.850 --> 15:23.519
See if you can get neurological
labs from next door.

15:23.521 --> 15:25.854
Travis?

15:25.856 --> 15:28.156
All the paperwork on this one
goes through me.

15:28.158 --> 15:30.194
Whatever you say, Doc.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.236
'Northeast Precinct,
how may I help you?'

15:40.238 --> 15:42.741
- Detective Lawson, please.
- 'One moment.'

16:53.244 --> 16:56.378
'Dr. Jones to Room 226, please.

17:04.253 --> 17:06.656
I'm gonna take a picture
of you now, alright?

17:12.496 --> 17:14.332
Let's get him back!

17:15.965 --> 17:21.270
Just hold on. Everybody hold on.
Guys, guys. Here we go.

17:21.271 --> 17:23.273
Hi. Hello.

17:25.275 --> 17:26.340
Don't worry about these guys.

17:26.343 --> 17:28.877
They're not gonna
do anything, OK?

17:28.879 --> 17:30.812
Now, I have to give you
an injection.

17:30.814 --> 17:32.882
It's for your benefit,
I promise you that.

17:32.884 --> 17:34.584
It's gonna make you feel
a whole lot better.

17:34.586 --> 17:37.819
It's a medicine,
it's called benzodiazepine.

17:37.821 --> 17:39.422
It affects your
neural transmitters.

17:39.424 --> 17:41.527
It's a sedative,
but it's perfectly safe.

17:46.430 --> 17:49.500
That's it, right.
It's no big deal.

17:50.801 --> 17:52.401
I know you're scared.

17:52.403 --> 17:54.604
You were in something
called a catatonic state, OK?

17:54.606 --> 17:56.973
It means you couldn't
talk or move.

17:56.975 --> 17:59.274
And when somebody
comes out of that too quickly,

17:59.276 --> 18:00.542
the way you just did,

18:00.544 --> 18:02.413
it can be very confusing.

18:04.014 --> 18:06.382
So why don't you
have a seat here?

18:06.384 --> 18:10.418
Just make yourself comfortable.
We're all calm here.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.490
Nothing's gonna hurt you.

18:19.563 --> 18:22.598
Remember how you got here?
Can I get an alcohol swab?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.367
Yeah.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.269
Hmm?
Thank you.

18:26.271 --> 18:30.242
No? It's all right.
It's all right.

18:33.711 --> 18:36.448
This is gonna hurt
just a little bit, all right?

18:40.284 --> 18:42.518
You're gonna feel
a little bit tired.

18:42.520 --> 18:45.657
That's fine.
You need some sleep.

18:46.456 --> 18:47.859
You did great.

18:58.503 --> 19:00.669
- Did you get hurt?
- No. No, I'm fine.

19:00.671 --> 19:04.440
Good. Let's let the drugs
do their work.

19:04.442 --> 19:06.309
Get him in a seclusion room
upfront.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.812
Absolutely.

19:23.994 --> 19:25.794
- Hey, Floyd!
- Yeah?

19:25.796 --> 19:29.464
Can you unlock number four
for me, please?

19:29.466 --> 19:30.835
Sure.

19:35.572 --> 19:38.773
- Long night?
- Not too bad, just this guy.

19:38.775 --> 19:41.312
Just this guy. Ha-ha!

19:44.549 --> 19:46.949
Ready? Here we go.
Count of three.

19:46.951 --> 19:48.951
One, two, three.

19:48.953 --> 19:52.387
Phew! Oh...
Phew, that dude is heavy.

19:52.389 --> 19:56.360
- Yeah. Thanks very much, Floyd.
- I got you.

20:26.924 --> 20:31.863
'Sick, sick, sick!
Stop it, stop it!'

20:40.437 --> 20:42.504
Whoa! Hey, hey!

21:02.959 --> 21:04.895
Hey, Trav. You OK, man?

21:06.531 --> 21:08.600
I think I need to go home.

21:09.466 --> 21:11.767
What?

21:11.769 --> 21:14.138
Hey, you gonna close the door?

21:26.484 --> 21:28.686
You two, back in your room.

23:24.301 --> 23:28.604
I called the police station
fifty times.

23:28.606 --> 23:31.042
I can't get anyone
to call me back.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.944
They tell me,
"Don't touch anything."

23:34.946 --> 23:38.817
It's costing me, you know?
Big time.

23:41.886 --> 23:46.688
Sorry you had to deal with it.
Were you here when it happened?

23:46.690 --> 23:50.661
Yeah. It was me
that called it in.

23:52.163 --> 23:57.232
Just all this crazy screaming,
yelling.

23:57.234 --> 24:01.337
It sounded like the guy
was arguing with someone,

24:01.339 --> 24:04.005
going back and forth,
real crazy.

24:04.007 --> 24:06.742
So I knocked on the door,
but he didn't answer,

24:06.744 --> 24:10.878
so I take my key, but the guy
slams the door in my face.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.083
That's when I called the show.

24:14.251 --> 24:16.184
They came
and knocked down the door

24:16.186 --> 24:18.822
and found him in the bathtub.

26:30.321 --> 26:32.287
Nothing helps here.
I'm not getting better.

26:32.289 --> 26:33.454
I cannot help you
unless you talk to me.

26:33.456 --> 26:34.923
I'm gonna die. You're gonna die.

26:34.925 --> 26:39.027
- Nobody ever gets better...
- Hello? Hello?

26:39.029 --> 26:41.797
- I'm not getting better...
- Can you hear me now, sir?

26:41.799 --> 26:44.265
You're going to die.
I can't stand this place.

26:44.267 --> 26:46.303
Come on, sir.

26:50.907 --> 26:53.075
Nothing helps here.
I'm not getting better...

26:53.077 --> 26:57.212
You're gonna be OK.
Sir, you're gonna be OK.

26:57.214 --> 27:00.214
Miss Lewis,
how are we feeling today?

27:00.216 --> 27:02.151
Ready to head home tomorrow?

27:02.153 --> 27:04.919
Yes, Dr. Forrester,
ready to go home.

27:04.921 --> 27:06.254
I can't stand this place.

27:06.256 --> 27:08.924
Nothing helps here.
I'm not getting better.

27:08.926 --> 27:11.159
I'm gonna die.
Nobody ever gets better.

27:11.161 --> 27:13.095
I can't stand this place...

27:18.401 --> 27:19.937
Morning.

27:22.540 --> 27:24.776
Why don't you have a seat?

27:26.510 --> 27:28.747
Just right here on the bed.

27:33.283 --> 27:35.419
Please, just take a seat.

27:37.554 --> 27:39.858
I have to...

27:41.891 --> 27:44.393
I have to get outta here.
Can you get me out?

27:44.395 --> 27:47.029
Not just now. Um...

27:47.031 --> 27:48.597
We need to hold you
under observation

27:48.599 --> 27:50.199
for about three days.

27:50.201 --> 27:53.367
And when you're feeling better,
you'll be released.

27:53.369 --> 27:56.238
Oh, no, I have to leave.
I have to leave now.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.309
Where do you have to go?

28:03.046 --> 28:05.480
I don't know.
I don't know. I just have to.

28:05.482 --> 28:08.317
Why don't you have a seat,
and we'll talk through it?

28:08.319 --> 28:10.187
Maybe we can figure it out.

28:20.129 --> 28:22.897
How... How...

28:22.899 --> 28:26.201
How did I get here?

28:26.203 --> 28:29.171
Does that mean
you don't remember how?

28:29.173 --> 28:31.075
What about your name,
do you know that?

28:34.477 --> 28:36.013
No.

28:42.418 --> 28:46.588
Have you ever taken any kind
of medication for depression?

28:46.590 --> 28:47.923
No.

28:47.925 --> 28:49.491
Bipolar disorder? Schizophrenia?

28:49.493 --> 28:52.560
No. I mean,
I don't know, I don't know.

28:52.562 --> 28:55.364
How about headaches?

28:55.366 --> 28:58.500
- Yeah... yeah.
- Can you describe them?

28:58.502 --> 29:02.604
They're terrible, er... terrible
headaches. They never stop.

29:02.606 --> 29:05.139
But you say you're not
on any medication currently?

29:05.141 --> 29:07.475
I don't know.
Didn't you just ask me that?

29:07.477 --> 29:10.414
You know, I think
I might have, yeah. Um...

29:12.148 --> 29:15.250
Tell you what,
let's try something different.

29:15.252 --> 29:19.257
But I'd like you to close
your eyes for me, if you will.

29:20.456 --> 29:23.061
- Is that OK?
- OK.

29:25.628 --> 29:28.433
Can you picture
what your mother looks like?

29:38.242 --> 29:40.177
What is it?

29:46.082 --> 29:47.584
Aargh!

29:48.686 --> 29:51.019
- You all right?
- Aargh.

29:51.021 --> 29:54.289
No. I don't remember anything.
I don't remember anything.

29:54.291 --> 29:55.589
Aargh!

29:55.591 --> 29:58.393
Calm down.
Just tell me, what's happening?

29:58.395 --> 30:01.396
- The ringing!
- Tell me what's going on.

30:01.398 --> 30:04.398
- Can you talk to me?
- Ringing! Stop ringing!

30:04.400 --> 30:06.536
What's ringing?

30:12.976 --> 30:15.077
- Did Travis check in?
- No, not yet.

30:15.079 --> 30:17.648
Oh, hey, yeah.
I'm on hold for Dr. Stoltz.

30:20.117 --> 30:23.117
Can you call down to IT,

30:23.119 --> 30:25.319
have them set up a laptop
for me in four?

30:25.321 --> 30:28.690
Yeah. What's going on?

30:28.692 --> 30:31.628
I think I wanna try something.

30:33.363 --> 30:35.731
What do you think?
Is that our guy?

30:35.733 --> 30:38.567
- Yeah, that's him.
- All right.

30:38.569 --> 30:40.469
Any news on the missing body?

30:40.471 --> 30:42.436
I can't help you with that one.

30:42.438 --> 30:43.605
Davidson's got it.

30:43.607 --> 30:46.010
All right,
I'll check with Davidson.

30:49.679 --> 30:51.346
Sure was a lot of blood,
wasn't there?

30:51.348 --> 30:53.014
Huh! Yeah, a lot of blood.

30:53.016 --> 30:55.986
It's really... What's the word?
...creative.

30:58.187 --> 30:59.687
So what are your thoughts
on the knife?

30:59.689 --> 31:01.655
What, on this stuff?

31:01.657 --> 31:02.758
I'm gonna take it
down to the lab,

31:02.760 --> 31:05.159
see what they
gotta say about it.

31:05.161 --> 31:07.695
Jim, don't you think we have
enough evidence here

31:07.697 --> 31:09.664
that points to a struggle?

31:09.666 --> 31:12.200
Well, it's hard to say for sure.

31:12.202 --> 31:13.402
Hard to say for sure...

31:13.404 --> 31:14.735
We have the stab wounds,

31:14.737 --> 31:17.539
we have the knife,
we have the bruises on the...

31:26.483 --> 31:28.582
Could I look at
the suicide note?

31:44.734 --> 31:46.801
What do you think?

31:46.803 --> 31:49.203
Do you mind
if I talk to the family?

31:49.205 --> 31:52.243
You wanna drive all the way
out there, that'd be great.

31:57.481 --> 32:00.417
You are afloat on the sea.

32:01.685 --> 32:04.251
The waves are calm.

32:04.253 --> 32:06.491
And you move with the waves.

32:08.692 --> 32:10.261
Good.

32:12.128 --> 32:14.261
Try to be comfortable
in your chair

32:14.263 --> 32:18.399
and listen closely to my words.

32:18.401 --> 32:23.073
Please look to the wall behind
me and find a spot to focus on.

32:24.841 --> 32:26.410
Any will do.

32:31.415 --> 32:34.382
And the spot will have
a special meaning for you.

32:34.384 --> 32:37.121
As you focus on it,
it will help you relax.

32:38.355 --> 32:43.125
And you will notice,
as I continue to speak,

32:43.127 --> 32:47.632
that that spot is changing
both its shape and color.

32:53.169 --> 32:56.671
And as you continue to relax,

32:56.673 --> 33:01.279
your eyelids feel heavy
as if they want to close.

33:02.745 --> 33:04.782
You can let them close.

33:08.185 --> 33:10.652
And with your eyes closed,

33:10.654 --> 33:13.687
you still see that spot

33:13.689 --> 33:18.292
as it grows smaller and smaller,

33:18.294 --> 33:21.599
and smaller and smaller,

33:23.367 --> 33:26.167
and smaller and smaller,

33:26.169 --> 33:27.772
and smaller...

33:37.313 --> 33:39.446
You can open
your eyes now.

33:39.448 --> 33:41.619
You can open your eyes now.

33:48.824 --> 33:53.730
- Am I dreaming?
- No, you are not dreaming.

33:56.867 --> 34:00.338
I'd like to ask you some
questions. Is that OK?

34:01.304 --> 34:02.372
Yes.

34:04.241 --> 34:06.575
Do you know where you are?

34:06.577 --> 34:09.847
Yes. I'm in the hospital.

34:12.748 --> 34:14.819
Do you know how you came
to be here?

34:16.286 --> 34:19.422
I died, and I came back.

34:20.924 --> 34:23.194
Wasn't the first time.

34:26.964 --> 34:30.699
Explain that. What does
that mean, "not the first time"?

34:30.701 --> 34:32.270
I can't kill it.

34:34.237 --> 34:36.639
It came back with me
in the fire...

34:38.708 --> 34:41.178
...and wandered into this world.

34:43.313 --> 34:46.617
It's... inside of me now.

34:48.784 --> 34:51.018
I can't stop it.

34:51.020 --> 34:53.954
I thought I could.

34:53.956 --> 34:58.460
It moves around me at night,
so I waited for it.

34:58.462 --> 35:00.962
I tried to get rid of it,
I kept...

35:00.964 --> 35:03.931
I kept cutting, cutting,

35:03.933 --> 35:06.536
cutting, cutting...

35:07.670 --> 35:09.839
...until I was dead.

35:11.808 --> 35:13.444
That didn't work.

35:13.976 --> 35:16.214
Here I am again.

35:18.681 --> 35:21.785
What is it that's inside of you?

35:24.020 --> 35:27.390
Blackness... spinning.

35:28.525 --> 35:29.894
Spinning.

35:35.665 --> 35:37.834
I can see its thoughts.

35:38.935 --> 35:40.869
I can see...

35:40.871 --> 35:44.942
I can see the things
that it's done.

35:46.643 --> 35:48.809
Horrible things.

35:48.811 --> 35:51.748
It's been here
before many times.

35:53.750 --> 35:56.550
And now...

35:56.552 --> 35:59.757
...now it's showing me
the things it's gonna do.

36:04.594 --> 36:08.465
When I killed myself,
I think I just made it stronger.

36:09.532 --> 36:13.804
It's attacking me,
wearing me down.

36:16.706 --> 36:18.442
It made me...

36:19.875 --> 36:23.281
Yes, go ahead, what is it?

36:28.985 --> 36:30.721
I killed someone.

36:32.755 --> 36:36.027
I killed someone. It's in me.

36:40.096 --> 36:41.865
Who did you kill?

36:49.639 --> 36:55.976
Just breathe.
Just calm down. Just breathe.

36:55.978 --> 36:59.516
I can't see.
I can't see anything.

37:11.962 --> 37:15.900
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me? Are you there?

37:16.665 --> 37:18.034
Hello?

38:10.654 --> 38:12.889
Dr. Forrester,
there you are.

38:19.228 --> 38:21.529
I didn't, er...

38:21.531 --> 38:25.002
I didn't wanna do this
in front of any of the patients.

38:26.536 --> 38:29.603
I have some really tragic news.

38:29.605 --> 38:36.511
Travis, one of our finest
nurses, passed away yesterday.

38:36.513 --> 38:41.081
Er... we're still not really
sure exactly what happened.

38:41.083 --> 38:43.183
He was brought
to our hospital last night.

38:43.185 --> 38:47.090
He was put in the ICU
and died shortly afterwards...

39:23.226 --> 39:25.726
'Daniel, what is it?'

39:25.728 --> 39:30.565
It is too late for me
to be calling you.

39:30.567 --> 39:33.804
And you should know better
than to answer, I think, right?

39:35.071 --> 39:37.107
'Just hold on.'

39:39.609 --> 39:41.608
What's going on?

39:41.610 --> 39:46.880
I just needed to talk to you
about a patient matter.

39:46.882 --> 39:49.752
Erm... can this wait
till tomorrow?

39:51.288 --> 39:53.090
Oh, sure, yeah.

39:54.290 --> 39:55.692
Yeah.

39:57.092 --> 39:58.261
Er...

40:03.032 --> 40:04.701
Are you OK?

40:05.768 --> 40:08.136
'Yeah, yeah.'

40:08.138 --> 40:11.204
It is nothing that we cannot
just talk about in the morning,

40:11.206 --> 40:12.877
so I'm...

40:15.744 --> 40:17.982
I'm gonna let you go, OK.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.759
Sorry, did I wake you up?

40:32.761 --> 40:35.128
It's two in the morning, Sarah.

40:35.130 --> 40:38.333
- Right, I got it.
- When is this gonna stop?

40:38.335 --> 40:41.101
I just, I've just...
I've known him for 20 years.

40:41.103 --> 40:43.371
I don't give a shit.
He cannot call here anymore.

40:43.373 --> 40:45.373
OK, I got it,
but after what happened today,

40:45.375 --> 40:48.875
is it possible just to give him
a break, is it possible?

40:48.877 --> 40:52.015
I'm sorry.

40:56.252 --> 40:58.656
I'm the only one he's got.

41:05.094 --> 41:08.631
'When he was 11,
his mom committed suicide.

41:10.333 --> 41:13.101
'She hung herself
in the bedroom.

41:13.103 --> 41:16.639
- 'He's the one who found her.'
- 'Jesus.'

41:18.340 --> 41:20.610
He's messed up.

41:28.418 --> 41:30.621
Goodnight.

41:32.121 --> 41:34.889
- Hey, Floyd.
- Ah... yeah?

41:34.891 --> 41:37.659
Gonna grab a smoke. You good?

41:37.661 --> 41:39.697
Yeah, I'm good, man.

41:48.003 --> 41:52.105
OK, Miss Lewis, it's way past
your bedtime, let's go.

41:52.107 --> 41:54.177
I'm not finished.

41:55.344 --> 41:58.012
You know the rules.

41:58.014 --> 42:00.985
- Let's go.
- I'm not finished!

42:02.985 --> 42:05.254
You're finished, let's go.

42:18.368 --> 42:21.201
Lights out.

42:21.203 --> 42:23.404
I bet you your eyes
are still open.

42:23.406 --> 42:27.411
Close your eyes, Miss Lewis.
Goodnight.

43:25.268 --> 43:28.268
Dude... you OK?

43:52.228 --> 43:55.429
What are you doing? Stop now!

44:18.054 --> 44:19.990
Ooh!

44:38.208 --> 44:39.777
No!

45:12.208 --> 45:15.512
Jesus!

45:18.947 --> 45:21.451
You all right? Come on,
let me get you off the floor.

45:23.219 --> 45:24.855
Are you OK?

45:27.322 --> 45:31.192
All right, it's OK.

45:31.194 --> 45:35.462
Let's get you back to the room.
I'll have somebody check on you.

45:35.464 --> 45:37.033
It's OK.

46:12.567 --> 46:14.470
'Blackness.

46:22.645 --> 46:24.882
'Spinning.

46:26.214 --> 46:28.315
'Horrible things.'

46:28.317 --> 46:29.886
'Horrible things.

46:31.186 --> 46:34.056
'It's showing me the things
it's going to do.'

46:46.668 --> 46:48.302
Yes?

46:48.304 --> 46:50.570
'Dr. Forrester,
it's one of your patients...'

46:50.572 --> 46:51.641
What?

48:46.822 --> 48:49.125
Jesus!

50:31.594 --> 50:34.895
- Is that your son?
- Yeah.

50:34.897 --> 50:39.699
We found him in
a motel just south of the city.

50:39.701 --> 50:43.637
He had been staying there
for several days.

50:43.639 --> 50:46.409
When's the last time
you saw him?

50:48.777 --> 50:54.715
He was, er... living with us
until about a week ago.

50:54.717 --> 50:57.985
He took our car
in the middle of the night,

50:57.987 --> 51:00.654
left the kids,
and just disappeared.

51:00.656 --> 51:03.657
Has your son ever attempted
to take his own life before?

51:03.659 --> 51:05.259
No.

51:05.261 --> 51:06.696
But...

51:07.964 --> 51:10.431
...it's been bad.

51:10.433 --> 51:13.467
He, er... Ever since the...

51:13.469 --> 51:15.735
The fire?

51:15.737 --> 51:19.375
He shouldn't have survived,
did you know that? Yeah...

51:23.279 --> 51:26.683
He should've died
alongside his wife in the fire.

51:28.250 --> 51:32.453
Not long after,
he started having problems,

51:32.455 --> 51:37.259
mental problems, started talking
to himself, seeing things.

51:46.469 --> 51:52.338
Does... this...
at all look familiar to you?

51:52.340 --> 51:53.877
No.

51:56.478 --> 52:00.317
Unfortunately...
I have some more bad news.

52:01.784 --> 52:03.951
Your son's body is missing.

52:03.953 --> 52:05.686
We don't know what happened,

52:05.688 --> 52:07.820
but right now the police
are investigating,

52:07.822 --> 52:10.623
and I assure you they're doing
everything in their power to...

52:10.625 --> 52:13.796
OK, OK.
Sorry, I can't do this anymore.

52:23.572 --> 52:26.610
I think there's something
you should see.

52:33.748 --> 52:35.851
No!

52:36.786 --> 52:40.387
No. No. No, no.

52:40.389 --> 52:41.591
No...

53:02.777 --> 53:04.880
Where's Dr. Forrester?

53:13.788 --> 53:15.891
Not that one!

53:17.826 --> 53:22.596
- Daniel...
- No! Take it! Take it!

53:22.598 --> 53:25.099
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing?

53:25.101 --> 53:27.871
Oh, Anne needs
a counter lorazepam.

53:29.003 --> 53:31.804
- How are you holding up?
- No!

53:31.806 --> 53:35.641
- Fine, thanks. Yeah.
- How's your patient?

53:35.643 --> 53:38.579
You're gonna have to
be more specific than that.

53:38.581 --> 53:40.780
You called me last night
about a bad patient.

53:40.782 --> 53:42.949
- You're right, I'm sorry. Yes.
- No!

53:42.951 --> 53:45.418
- No, I think I can handle it.
- You sure?

53:45.420 --> 53:47.788
- Yeah, yeah.
- Which patient was it?

53:47.790 --> 53:50.824
I can talk you through
whatever you need, so...

53:50.826 --> 53:52.025
That'd be great. I'd like that.

53:52.027 --> 53:53.860
I'm a little bit short
on time right now.

53:53.862 --> 53:56.565
- Can I find you after?
- Yeah.

54:19.020 --> 54:21.657
Testing, one, two, three.

54:25.895 --> 54:27.931
'Testing, one, two, three.'

56:05.661 --> 56:08.197
There's one other thing.

56:25.681 --> 56:30.019
Can you hear me? Hear my voice?

56:44.333 --> 56:45.902
Yes.

56:55.643 --> 56:59.579
I wanna get back to
what we talked about last time.

56:59.581 --> 57:02.118
You said you killed someone.
Do you remember that?

57:04.652 --> 57:07.189
I've killed two people now.

57:11.125 --> 57:13.092
Who did you kill?

57:13.094 --> 57:15.197
It's getting stronger.

57:17.699 --> 57:22.906
I don't know them.
I'm starting to disappear.

57:24.172 --> 57:26.940
Listen to me. You said
you killed two people.

57:26.942 --> 57:28.675
Now, how did you kill them?

57:28.677 --> 57:31.244
You're not listening to me.

57:31.246 --> 57:34.715
When this thing gets what
it wants, it will take me over

57:34.717 --> 57:37.784
and you won't be able
to stop it, no one will.

57:37.786 --> 57:41.688
Everyone is going to die.
Everyone!

57:41.690 --> 57:45.092
No. Let's get back to what
we talked about yesterday.

57:45.094 --> 57:48.027
This is serious.
Did you hurt someone?

57:48.029 --> 57:50.931
- You have to kill me.
- No.

57:50.933 --> 57:53.233
Take a knife
and cut my throat open.

57:53.235 --> 57:55.936
- No one is doing that.
- Take a knife...

57:55.938 --> 57:58.838
- No.
- ...and cut my throat open.

57:58.840 --> 58:01.109
Cut me open! Cut me! Cut me!

58:04.313 --> 58:05.344
Jesus!

58:07.348 --> 58:09.916
Hey... let me call you back.

58:09.918 --> 58:12.689
No! Jesus!

58:29.237 --> 58:31.904
Kill me. Kill me.

58:31.906 --> 58:33.440
Kill me. Kill me.

58:33.442 --> 58:35.945
- Kill me.
- Jesus.

58:53.728 --> 58:55.829
Hey. Hey!

59:01.302 --> 59:03.737
...Forrester! Are you OK?

59:03.739 --> 59:06.042
Hey! Dr. Forrester!

59:08.342 --> 59:12.281
Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.

59:35.369 --> 59:36.705
No!

01:00:09.871 --> 01:00:12.905
'...it'll take me over

01:00:12.907 --> 01:00:14.206
'and you won't
be able to stop it.

01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:15.877
'No one will.

01:00:18.913 --> 01:00:22.349
'Everyone is going to die!
Every...'

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:18.270
Daniel, we need
to speak right now.

01:01:18.272 --> 01:01:20.842
- Just a minute...
- I said right now!

01:01:23.244 --> 01:01:24.844
What the hell happened in there?

01:01:24.846 --> 01:01:26.246
That man is dangerous...

01:01:26.248 --> 01:01:29.382
That man is injured because
of what you did, Daniel!

01:01:29.384 --> 01:01:32.284
And you administered Thiopental?
Are you kidding me?

01:01:32.286 --> 01:01:34.454
I can explain that, but we do
not have time for this....

01:01:34.456 --> 01:01:36.088
I cannot believe this patient

01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:38.426
was capable of filling out
a 20-page interview form...

01:01:42.029 --> 01:01:44.432
You didn't... You didn't
get his consent, did you?

01:01:49.438 --> 01:01:53.239
What you did is illegal.

01:01:53.241 --> 01:01:56.442
I will stand before a review,
but we cannot release that....

01:01:56.444 --> 01:01:58.612
That patient is gone
as of tomorrow!

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:00.346
And we're lucky
this entire hospital

01:02:00.348 --> 01:02:03.416
is not brought down
by a lawsuit!

01:02:03.418 --> 01:02:05.317
After all the chances
that I've given you,

01:02:05.319 --> 01:02:07.420
you do... you do this?

01:02:07.422 --> 01:02:09.521
I didn't even think
you were capable

01:02:09.523 --> 01:02:11.860
of doing something like this.

01:02:13.962 --> 01:02:16.228
I'm sorry.

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:20.468
I'm sorry. It's my fault.
I... I admit, I was out of line.

01:02:22.503 --> 01:02:26.105
You are not his doctor anymore.

01:02:26.107 --> 01:02:28.641
I don't want you
within 50 feet of that man.

01:02:28.643 --> 01:02:32.112
- Do you understand me?
- I understand.

01:02:32.114 --> 01:02:35.351
And when his hold is up
tomorrow, we are releasing him.

01:02:37.219 --> 01:02:38.421
OK.

01:02:47.596 --> 01:02:52.635
What you've done here...
what you've done to me,

01:02:53.601 --> 01:02:55.503
...it's betrayal.

01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:03.570
- Anne?
- Dr. Forrester, I am sorry.

01:04:03.572 --> 01:04:06.442
- Dr. Grey came to me...
- Stop it. Just stop it.

01:04:08.176 --> 01:04:10.576
I just came from Eval 1. Drew
needs some help with an intake.

01:04:10.578 --> 01:04:12.681
He's asking for you.

01:04:33.567 --> 01:04:38.073
Recovered any memories lately?
Huh?

01:04:40.542 --> 01:04:44.447
I am so goddamn
sick of your lies.

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.547
What?

01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:51.250
You think I don't know a liar
when I see one?

01:04:51.252 --> 01:04:53.420
How did you get out
of this room?

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:57.590
Dr. Forrester, open the door!

01:04:57.592 --> 01:05:00.296
- Help!
- Stop!

01:05:01.228 --> 01:05:02.695
What did you do to Travis?

01:05:02.697 --> 01:05:05.165
Tell me.
What did you do to them?

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:07.634
- I didn't do any...
- You killed them, didn't you?

01:05:07.636 --> 01:05:08.668
- No!
- Say it.

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:10.335
You killed them, didn't you?

01:05:10.337 --> 01:05:13.672
Tell me right now. Tell me!

01:05:13.674 --> 01:05:17.177
- My name is Michael Clark.
- What?

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:19.112
Daniel, stop it!

01:05:19.114 --> 01:05:20.679
My name is Michael Clark.

01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:22.648
My name is Michael Clark.

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:24.150
I don't wanna hear
any more of your lies.

01:05:24.152 --> 01:05:26.085
- My name is Michael Clark.
- No.

01:05:26.087 --> 01:05:28.721
My kids, where are my kids?

01:05:28.723 --> 01:05:29.822
I don't wanna hear
any more of your shit!

01:05:29.824 --> 01:05:31.590
Where are my children?

01:05:31.592 --> 01:05:36.195
Where are my children?
I can remember now! Oh, God!

01:05:36.197 --> 01:05:39.199
I need to see my kids now!

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:50.146
Where are my kids, Doc?

01:05:51.712 --> 01:05:53.846
- No!
- Where are my kids?

01:05:53.848 --> 01:05:56.317
You killed them, didn't you?

01:06:01.556 --> 01:06:03.822
Daniel, stop it!
Stop it!

01:06:03.824 --> 01:06:08.795
- Goddamn it!
- Just sedate him! Sedate him!

01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:10.666
Say it! Say it!

01:06:23.777 --> 01:06:25.612
'Your call
is very important to us.

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:28.780
'Please stay on the line.'

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:48.571
'This is Dr. Ross.
How can I help you?'

01:06:50.605 --> 01:06:55.308
Dr. Ross, it's Dr. Graham.
Any news on that missing body?

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:58.444
'Actually, we do
have some news.'

01:06:58.446 --> 01:07:01.413
They found Michael Clark,
but it's not what you think.

01:07:01.415 --> 01:07:04.717
'There's been some kind
of mistake, but he's alive.

01:07:04.719 --> 01:07:06.219
'He's been in
the Psych Ward here.

01:07:06.221 --> 01:07:08.657
'They're releasing him today...'

01:07:17.264 --> 01:07:19.431
Sweetie, I can't help you
if I can't understand you.

01:07:19.433 --> 01:07:20.599
Talk slower...

01:07:20.601 --> 01:07:21.934
Anne, where's her list
of medications?

01:07:21.936 --> 01:07:23.735
It should be
in her file there...

01:07:23.737 --> 01:07:25.371
My bed's too close to the door.

01:07:25.373 --> 01:07:28.574
When people walk in,
I hide under the sheet.

01:07:28.576 --> 01:07:29.942
It hurts my eyes too much.

01:07:29.944 --> 01:07:31.578
Your bed is too close
to the door?

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.279
It's too close to the door
because...

01:07:36.618 --> 01:07:39.652
I will not wait! I wanna see
my son right the hell now!

01:07:39.654 --> 01:07:42.422
I know, I know,
but you're early.

01:07:42.424 --> 01:07:44.857
- Early for what?
- Mr. Clark...

01:07:44.859 --> 01:07:47.293
- Mr. Clark...
- What is this? Where's my son?

01:07:47.295 --> 01:07:49.295
If you could just come with me
and sit here...

01:07:49.297 --> 01:07:51.663
I don't wanna sit down.
I wanna see my son right now!

01:07:51.665 --> 01:07:53.568
Calm down, calm down.

01:07:56.371 --> 01:08:00.672
They told me my son was dead.
Did you know that?

01:08:00.674 --> 01:08:04.580
They showed me pictures...
pictures of him dead.

01:08:07.581 --> 01:08:11.319
Just let him go. Just let
him go. Give him the space.

01:08:12.886 --> 01:08:14.721
Anne, can you sit down
with Mr. Clark,

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:16.926
help him fill out
all the paperwork...?

01:08:18.759 --> 01:08:21.496
- Is he awake yet?
- Not yet, Dr. Grey.

01:08:22.696 --> 01:08:25.633
I did give him
a strong sedative.

01:08:32.773 --> 01:08:35.274
OK. Er... well,
if he does wake up,

01:08:35.276 --> 01:08:38.010
just contact the front desk,
they'll know where to find me.

01:08:38.011 --> 01:08:39.979
- We'll take it from there.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:08:39.981 --> 01:08:42.551
Hopefully, there shouldn't be
any more problems.

01:08:57.865 --> 01:09:00.801
Hello? I'm Dr. Grey.

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:03.502
Your father is here
to pick you...

01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:09.678
You feeling OK?

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:19.319
Help me...

01:09:40.607 --> 01:09:43.076
Hey, Dr. Grey, I just
finished up with the father

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:45.912
and he should
be ready to go anytime.

01:09:45.913 --> 01:09:48.517
What's the matter? Are you OK?

01:10:18.612 --> 01:10:21.417
- I'll walk them out, Anne.
- Good. Thanks.

01:13:05.312 --> 01:13:08.915
Nothing helps here.
I'm gonna die. You're gonna die.

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:12.051
Nobody ever gets better.
I can't stand this place.

01:13:12.053 --> 01:13:15.555
Nothing helps here.
I'm gonna die. You're gonna die.

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:19.027
Nobody ever gets better.
I can't stand this place....

01:13:23.697 --> 01:13:25.066
Where is he?

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:28.634
- Where is he?
- He's gone. Released.

01:13:28.636 --> 01:13:31.106
- Where'd he go?
- Released.

01:13:32.706 --> 01:13:34.075
Where's Sarah?

01:13:35.343 --> 01:13:38.577
Where's Sarah, Anne?
Where's Sarah?

01:13:38.579 --> 01:13:39.947
Where's Sarah?

01:14:01.268 --> 01:14:03.070
Sarah? Sarah!

01:14:05.606 --> 01:14:09.041
Sarah, look at me.

01:14:09.043 --> 01:14:12.310
Can you talk? Can you tell me
what's wrong? Sarah?

01:14:12.312 --> 01:14:15.150
Staff! Staff!

01:14:18.652 --> 01:14:20.752
No...

01:14:20.754 --> 01:14:23.756
Staff! Goddamn it!
I need help in here!

01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:44.909
Oh, my God!

01:14:44.911 --> 01:14:47.345
Dr. Grey,
can you hear me?

01:14:47.347 --> 01:14:50.785
- What did you do?
- No motor sense...

01:15:58.319 --> 01:16:01.086
Hey, kids, hey.

01:16:01.088 --> 01:16:04.724
Hey, hey, hey!
I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.826
Hey, kids.
Dad's not feeling well.

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:08.260
Go inside
and you can talk to him later.

01:16:08.262 --> 01:16:11.096
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand!

01:16:11.098 --> 01:16:14.735
Kids, inside now! Go.
Go on!

01:16:17.437 --> 01:16:20.374
That's it. OK.

01:16:31.819 --> 01:16:34.452
It lands on this car,

01:16:34.454 --> 01:16:39.091
and then it flies and takes the
car with it and the butterflies.

01:16:39.093 --> 01:16:41.159
What are
we supposed to do?

01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:43.095
Leave him in that hospital?

01:16:43.097 --> 01:16:46.265
- He shouldn't be here!
- I had no other choice!

01:16:46.267 --> 01:16:48.170
Look, you know what?

01:16:50.538 --> 01:16:52.304
- OK...
- Eat your dinner.

01:16:52.306 --> 01:16:54.372
There you go.

01:16:54.374 --> 01:16:57.845
- All right. Thanks.
- Sorry.

01:17:04.218 --> 01:17:05.551
Stop!

01:17:34.382 --> 01:17:36.515
Mike! Mike! Mike!

01:17:36.517 --> 01:17:39.855
Hold him. Hold him.

01:17:40.987 --> 01:17:43.055
- Hold him.
- Ben...

01:17:43.057 --> 01:17:44.489
Mike!

01:17:44.491 --> 01:17:46.927
He's having a seizure! Mike!

01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:51.398
Mike? What the hell?

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.835
It's OK, it's OK.

01:18:06.513 --> 01:18:09.049
Just get the kids outta here!

01:24:17.317 --> 01:24:18.852
No!

01:24:41.275 --> 01:24:43.442
What is it?

01:24:43.444 --> 01:24:45.480
What is it you want?

01:24:46.312 --> 01:24:47.813
Everyone.

01:28:00.039 --> 01:28:04.042
All right. Sir, can you
tell me what's going on?

01:28:04.044 --> 01:28:07.615
Can you tell me your name?
Sir, can you tell me your name?

01:28:10.851 --> 01:28:14.118
You got a pretty good cut
on your forehead here.

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.091
You need that patched up.
It's gonna be OK, sir.
