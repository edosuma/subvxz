WEBVTT

00:08.734 --> 00:10.401
Aren't the clouds
beautiful?

00:10.468 --> 00:12.633
They look like
big balls of cotton.

00:14.700 --> 00:17.034
I could just
lie here all day

00:17.101 --> 00:19.001
and watch them
drift by.

00:21.001 --> 00:22.967
If you use
your imagination,

00:23.034 --> 00:24.368
you could see
lots of things

00:24.434 --> 00:26.001
in the cloud
formations.

00:26.067 --> 00:28.401
What do you think
you see, Linus?

00:29.567 --> 00:31.800
Well, those clouds
up there look to me

00:31.867 --> 00:34.967
like the map of the british
honduras on the caribbean.

00:36.368 --> 00:37.934
That cloud up there

00:38.001 --> 00:41.301
looks a little like the
profile of thomas eakins,

00:41.368 --> 00:43.201
the famous painter
and sculptor.

00:43.267 --> 00:45.234
And that group of clouds
over there

00:45.301 --> 00:48.101
<i>gives me the impression
of the stoning of stephen.</i>

00:48.167 --> 00:49.967
I can see
the apostle paul

00:50.034 --> 00:52.001
standing there
to one side.

00:52.067 --> 00:54.234
Uh-huh.
That's very good.

00:54.301 --> 00:57.201
What do you see in the
clouds, Charlie Brown?

00:58.368 --> 00:59.500
Well,

00:59.567 --> 01:01.533
I was going to say
I saw a ducky

01:01.600 --> 01:04.233
and a horsy,
but I changed my mind.

02:09.201 --> 02:12.834
<i>like the shadows
of morning</i>

02:16.734 --> 02:21.468
<i>climb up
to the august afternoon</i>

02:24.301 --> 02:27.167
<i>Charlie has a way</i>

02:28.234 --> 02:31.101
<i>of picking up the day</i>

02:32.800 --> 02:37.334
<i>just by walking slowly
in a room</i>

02:40.633 --> 02:45.434
<i>maybe it's a kind of magic</i>

02:48.934 --> 02:53.368
<i>that only little boys
can do</i>

02:55.167 --> 02:59.301
<i>but seeing Charlie smile</i>

03:00.234 --> 03:04.667
<i>can make you stop awhile</i>

03:04.734 --> 03:08.633
<i>and get you feeling glad
you're you</i>

03:12.434 --> 03:17.134
<i>he's only a boy
named Charlie</i>

03:21.134 --> 03:25.800
<i>a boy named Charlie Brown</i>

03:28.567 --> 03:31.468
<i>he's just a kid next door</i>

03:31.533 --> 03:34.201
<i>perhaps a little more</i>

03:36.368 --> 03:41.301
<i>he's every kid
in every town</i>

03:44.734 --> 03:49.600
<i>the world is full
of lots of people</i>

03:52.434 --> 03:57.301
<i>here and there
and all around</i>

03:59.401 --> 04:04.201
<i>but people, after all</i>

04:04.267 --> 04:07.834
<i>start out as being small</i>

04:09.134 --> 04:12.967
<i>and we're all a boy named</i>

04:13.034 --> 04:16.733
<i>Charlie Brown</i>

05:34.301 --> 05:37.533
I'll never be able
to get this kite in the air.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.800
Never! Never!
Never! Never!

05:40.867 --> 05:44.434
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

05:46.067 --> 05:49.667
I don't want to see this
kite again as long as I live.

05:53.034 --> 05:56.633
Take it. Take it.
Get it out of my sight!

05:58.101 --> 06:01.368
Anybody who can fly this kite is a genius.

06:30.101 --> 06:31.633
<i>My heart is full</i>

06:31.700 --> 06:34.434
<i>on the day I first go out
to the old ball field.</i>

06:35.633 --> 06:37.900
<i>I love the memories.</i>

06:39.567 --> 06:42.468
<i>I love the smell
of the horsehide.</i>

06:44.267 --> 06:48.201
<i>I love the smell of the grassy
outfield and the dusty infield.</i>

06:50.167 --> 06:54.401
<i>The hopes and the dreams
for the new season.</i>

06:54.468 --> 06:57.567
<i>Ah, there it is,
the old pitcher's mound,</i>

06:57.633 --> 07:00.800
<i>covered with tradition
and dandelions.</i>

07:00.867 --> 07:02.267
<i>Dandelions?</i>

07:04.468 --> 07:07.301
This pitcher's mound
is covered with dandelions!

07:07.368 --> 07:10.234
Don't touch them,
Charlie Brown!

07:10.301 --> 07:13.533
Don't you dare hurt all
those innocent dandelions.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.734
They're beautiful.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.001
Don't you dare
cut them down.

07:20.234 --> 07:22.401
Besides,
you may not know it,

07:22.468 --> 07:26.500
but you look kind of cute standing
there surrounded by dandelions.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.734
I don't want to look cute.

10:33.267 --> 10:34.734
All right,
Charlie Brown,

10:34.800 --> 10:37.001
let's get
our signals straight.

10:37.067 --> 10:39.667
1 finger will mean
the high straight ball.

10:39.734 --> 10:41.934
2 fingers will mean
the low straight ball.

10:42.001 --> 10:45.301
What about my curveball,
and my slider

10:45.368 --> 10:48.067
and my knuckle ball,
and my sidearm,

10:48.134 --> 10:50.201
and my submarine pitch?

10:50.267 --> 10:53.234
1 finger will mean
the high straight ball.

10:53.301 --> 10:56.134
And 2 fingers will mean
the low straight ball.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.267
Hey, what's this?

11:01.334 --> 11:03.967
What in the world are
all these dandelions doing

11:04.034 --> 11:06.167
on the pitcher's mound?

11:06.234 --> 11:07.500
They grew there

11:07.567 --> 11:08.633
and the girls
on our team

11:08.700 --> 11:10.667
won't let me
cut 'em down.

11:10.734 --> 11:12.967
They say they're pretty

11:13.034 --> 11:15.934
and they say I look cute
standing here among them.

11:20.234 --> 11:21.434
They're right.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.234
You do look kind of cute
standing there.

12:11.533 --> 12:13.067
Charlie Brown,

12:13.134 --> 12:15.767
Charlie Brown, it's taking you too long

12:15.834 --> 12:18.101
to get dressed
after every pitch.

12:18.167 --> 12:20.800
If you can't get dressed
a little faster,

12:20.867 --> 12:23.134
we'll never get through
the first inning.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.167
Wait.

12:34.067 --> 12:35.201
Hmm.

12:35.267 --> 12:37.700
Brush this guy back,
Charlie Brown.

12:37.767 --> 12:39.967
Give him
the old bean ball.

12:40.034 --> 12:43.600
No, I can't do that,
it wouldn't be right.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.834
"It wouldn't be right"?

12:45.900 --> 12:48.967
Listen who's gone moral
on us all of a sudden.

12:49.034 --> 12:53.401
Old wishy-washy here is too
moral to throw a bean ball.

12:53.468 --> 12:56.201
What about the way the early
settlers treated the indians?

12:56.267 --> 12:58.101
Yeah and what about
those awful movie ads?

12:58.167 --> 12:59.600
What about
the children's crusade?

12:59.667 --> 13:00.934
Was that moral?

13:01.001 --> 13:03.401
Do you think that
incident at harper's ferry

13:03.468 --> 13:04.967
was consistent
with morality?

13:05.034 --> 13:06.468
Do you call that morality? Define morality.

13:06.533 --> 13:08.067
Our whole system
of freeways

13:08.134 --> 13:10.167
is a perfect example of
what I'm trying to say.

13:10.234 --> 13:12.401
Have you listened
to the radio lately?

13:12.468 --> 13:15.234
How about this whole
conservation situation?

13:15.301 --> 13:17.533
We never win
any ball games,

13:17.600 --> 13:19.900
but we sure have
some interesting discussions.

13:29.533 --> 13:31.101
What happened?

13:31.167 --> 13:33.767
Charlie Brown got hit by a line drive.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.633
Does anyone here know
anything about first aid?

13:36.700 --> 13:38.967
It's probably
not serious,

13:39.034 --> 13:40.867
second or third aid
will do.

13:40.934 --> 13:43.034
Here, run over to
the drinking fountain

13:43.101 --> 13:45.468
and soak this handkerchief in cold water.

13:49.001 --> 13:50.267
You're kidding.

13:50.334 --> 13:52.401
With a head like
Charlie Brown's,

13:52.468 --> 13:54.834
you'll need
a bed sheet.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.101
I'm dying and all I hear are insults.

13:58.734 --> 13:59.967
What happened?

14:00.034 --> 14:01.134
You got hit
on the head

14:01.201 --> 14:03.301
with a line drive,
Charlie Brown.

14:04.201 --> 14:05.567
I don't understand it.

14:05.633 --> 14:08.334
I used to be able to
dodge those line drives.

14:08.401 --> 14:12.201
When you get old, your
reflexes really slow down.

15:30.134 --> 15:33.900
<i>Well, we lost the first game
of the season again.</i>

15:33.967 --> 15:37.067
<i>I shouldn't let it
bother me, but it does.</i>

15:37.134 --> 15:40.067
<i>We always seem to lose
the first game of the season</i>

15:40.134 --> 15:42.201
<i>and the last game
of the season.</i>

15:52.301 --> 15:55.934
And all those stupid games
in between!

15:56.001 --> 15:57.267
<i>In the big leagues,</i>

15:57.334 --> 16:00.468
<i>the ballplayers
get sent to the showers.</i>

16:00.533 --> 16:02.800
<i>I get sent to take a bath.</i>

16:06.067 --> 16:10.001
<i>Nothing ever seems
to go right for me.</i>

16:10.067 --> 16:13.834
<i>I can't fly a kite and I
lose every ballgame I play in.</i>

16:15.401 --> 16:18.234
<i>I just can't seem
to do anything right.</i>

16:24.867 --> 16:26.334
Hi, Charlie Brown.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.301
You're depressed,
aren't you?

16:30.368 --> 16:33.267
I suppose you forgot
we lost another ball game.

16:33.334 --> 16:34.767
I did not.

16:34.834 --> 16:38.334
Today's game made our 99th
straight loss without a win.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.600
That wasn't a very good
game today, Charlie Brown.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.434
I know it.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.967
I'm getting tired of
losing all these ball games.

16:50.633 --> 16:52.734
And this was going
to be our big year.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.001
The year
when it looked like

16:54.067 --> 16:56.001
we might even score
our first run.

16:59.334 --> 17:03.834
I think it would be kind of
fun to win once in a while.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.867
Winning isn't
everything.

17:05.934 --> 17:08.532
But losing
isn't anything.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.300
Look at it this way,
Charlie Brown.

17:10.367 --> 17:13.166
We learn more from losing
than we do from winning.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.967
I guess that makes me the
smartest person in the whole world.

17:19.267 --> 17:20.733
I think you just
talk yourself

17:20.800 --> 17:22.800
into being a loser,
Charlie Brown.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.834
I really don't believe
in this business

17:24.900 --> 17:27.267
of some people
being born losers.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.567
If you keep on
doing different things,

17:30.633 --> 17:31.867
you're going to win

17:31.934 --> 17:33.767
just as much
as anyone else.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.533
Just keep trying,
Charlie Brown.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.767
Don't give up.

17:36.834 --> 17:38.800
You'll win your share
of ball games.

17:38.867 --> 17:40.834
I just don't think
it's possible

17:40.900 --> 17:43.734
for someone to lose
everything all the time.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.034
One of these days,
you'll win.

20:34.767 --> 20:38.134
Why can't I have an ordinary
dog like everybody else?

21:01.267 --> 21:03.001
<i>Sometimes I get
so discouraged</i>

21:03.067 --> 21:05.301
<i>that I can hardly stand it.</i>

21:05.368 --> 21:08.468
<i>The harder I try,
the worse I get.</i>

21:08.533 --> 21:10.767
<i>Perhaps I should seek
professional help.</i>

21:14.533 --> 21:16.368
I think I need help.

21:16.434 --> 21:17.434
Hmm.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.533
Everything I do
turns to failure.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.533
I guess you know
I've never succeeded

21:22.600 --> 21:24.767
at anything
in my whole life.

21:24.834 --> 21:27.001
Charlie Brown, it's true.

21:27.067 --> 21:30.834
I recognize your frailties,
your weaknesses.

21:30.900 --> 21:34.267
You need me to point out
your faults, Charlie Brown.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.167
It's for your own good.

21:36.234 --> 21:40.034
Besides, I can do it for
you better than anyone else.

21:40.834 --> 21:42.867
My system is unique.

21:44.334 --> 21:46.134
What's so unique
about it?

21:47.401 --> 21:49.867
Come in and sit down,
Charlie Brown.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.667
I'll explain
my unique system.

21:52.734 --> 21:54.867
Make yourself at home,
Charlie Brown.

21:54.934 --> 21:56.934
I'll set up my equipment.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.600
See what I've done?

21:59.667 --> 22:02.267
I've put all of
your faults on slides.

22:02.334 --> 22:05.800
We're going to project
your faults onto a screen.

22:07.368 --> 22:10.734
Good grief, project my
faults onto a screen?

22:17.767 --> 22:19.800
Now,
watch carefully.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.201
Here we see your failure

22:23.267 --> 22:26.500
to observe the world
in upright position.

22:26.567 --> 22:29.533
Here we see your lack of
coordination, Charlie Brown.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.067
And here we see
your lack of style.

22:32.134 --> 22:34.800
Now, on to
your physical faults.

22:34.867 --> 22:38.734
These slides will show your
tendency towards fatness.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.301
Look at that stomach.

22:41.368 --> 22:44.600
Even your nose is fat,
and your legs.

22:44.667 --> 22:49.600
Why, I'll bet if the truth were
known, even your toes are fat.

22:53.034 --> 22:56.001
Now, we're really going
to get down to business.

22:56.067 --> 22:58.368
The next batch of slides
will show

22:58.434 --> 23:01.767
your biggest
and most damaging faults.

23:01.834 --> 23:04.234
These could take
about an hour to show.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.834
Uh...

23:11.834 --> 23:13.667
No, no.

23:13.734 --> 23:17.500
Ugh. Turn it off! I
can't stand it any longer!

23:17.567 --> 23:22.667
I can't stand to watch! I can't
stand it! I can't stand it!

23:22.734 --> 23:25.234
One moment there,
Charlie Brown.

23:27.167 --> 23:29.567
Relax here a while,
Charlie Brown.

23:29.633 --> 23:31.734
We'll solve this
problem together.

23:31.800 --> 23:35.633
The way I see it, your
problem is one of emotions.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.900
When you have
emotional problems,

23:37.967 --> 23:40.700
it is usually because
you have no outlets.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.401
You need
emotional outlets.

23:43.468 --> 23:45.900
I need
emotional outlets.

23:48.001 --> 23:50.734
What kind of emotional
outlets would you suggest?

23:50.800 --> 23:52.967
This football
is a perfect answer.

23:53.034 --> 23:57.267
There is no better emotional
outlet than kicking a football.

23:57.334 --> 23:59.967
To sum it all up in one
phrase, Charlie Brown,

24:00.034 --> 24:02.267
you could kick away
your faults.

24:05.567 --> 24:08.101
Boy, you must think
I am stupid.

24:08.167 --> 24:10.500
You just wanna
hold that football

24:10.567 --> 24:12.667
and have me come running at
to kick at it

24:12.734 --> 24:16.533
so you can pull it away and
see me fall flat on my back!

24:16.600 --> 24:18.867
The cure is up to you,
Charlie Brown.

24:18.934 --> 24:21.633
Do you wanna kick the habit,
or don't you.

24:24.667 --> 24:27.500
Perhaps you'd rather have
another viewing session

24:27.567 --> 24:30.001
of all your faults
on those slides.

24:30.067 --> 24:31.867
All right! All right!

24:31.934 --> 24:34.034
I'll try it!
I'll try it!

24:34.101 --> 24:36.434
No more slides!

24:36.500 --> 24:39.468
You won't be disappointed, Charlie Brown.

24:39.533 --> 24:43.334
This time I have a little
extra surprise as a bonus.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.767
Why, oh, why do I let her do this to me?

24:53.834 --> 24:55.368
Why? Why?

24:57.500 --> 24:59.834
Maybe she's right.

24:59.900 --> 25:03.034
After all if you can't
trust your own psychiatrist,

25:03.101 --> 25:04.468
who can you trust?

25:05.834 --> 25:07.600
This time
I'm really gonna kick it.

25:07.667 --> 25:09.434
I'm gonna kick the habit.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.567
This is the end
of all my faults.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.500
And now
for the surprise.

25:17.567 --> 25:20.734
Would you like to see how
it looked on instant replay?

25:20.800 --> 25:23.867
Instant replay?

25:28.101 --> 25:29.734
Hear you are,
Charlie Brown.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.434
Now I'm going to run
through this at slow motion.

25:34.134 --> 25:36.500
I think we must carefully
analyze your every move,

25:36.567 --> 25:38.334
your every expression.

25:41.967 --> 25:44.567
See how erratic
your movements are?

25:45.834 --> 25:47.301
Look at your face!

25:47.368 --> 25:50.867
Those bad personality traits
we spoke about

25:50.934 --> 25:53.334
stand out clearly.

25:53.401 --> 25:56.967
Now, see the look of
determination on your face.

25:57.967 --> 26:00.034
Oh, sham,
Charlie Brown.

26:00.101 --> 26:03.301
A failure face
if I ever saw one.

26:03.368 --> 26:06.167
In turn, see how benign

26:06.234 --> 26:10.368
and composed my face is, Charlie Brown.

26:10.434 --> 26:13.867
And your clumsiness,
Charlie Brown.

26:13.934 --> 26:16.900
Shall we run through it
once more at normal speed?

26:16.967 --> 26:18.633
<i>No.</i>

26:18.700 --> 26:20.500
No, I don't think so.

26:29.434 --> 26:33.034
I've never gone through
anything like that in my life.

26:33.101 --> 26:36.800
I never knew
I could be so stupid.

26:36.867 --> 26:40.500
I never knew
I had so many faults.

26:40.567 --> 26:43.434
I never felt
so completely miserable.

26:46.134 --> 26:48.500
Wait until you get my bill.

27:05.567 --> 27:08.800
These psychiatric treatments
are going to bankrupt me.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.434
Get up, Linus,
it's time to go to school.

27:23.967 --> 27:24.967
Again?

27:25.034 --> 27:26.900
What do you mean, again?

27:26.967 --> 27:29.334
I went yesterday.

27:29.401 --> 27:31.600
Mom's already
made your lunch.

27:35.533 --> 27:38.034
Guess I might as well
go to school.

27:38.101 --> 27:40.101
I can't waste a good lunch.

27:47.267 --> 27:52.401
Do you have to drag that stupid
blanket to school every day?

27:52.468 --> 27:56.234
How would you feel if people
came up to you and said:

27:56.301 --> 28:00.468
"Your little brother drags a
blanket with him wherever he goes"?

28:03.500 --> 28:05.767
This blanket
is a necessity.

28:05.834 --> 28:08.500
It keeps me
from cracking up.

28:08.567 --> 28:12.034
It could be regarded
as a spiritual tourniquet.

28:12.101 --> 28:15.067
Without this blanket,
I'd be nothing.

28:15.967 --> 28:18.500
A ship without a rudder.

28:18.567 --> 28:20.101
Oh, good grief.

28:40.267 --> 28:43.001
Hey, Charlie Brown.
Wait for me.

28:46.101 --> 28:47.500
You look like
you've been taking

28:47.567 --> 28:49.867
shock treatments
or something.

28:49.934 --> 28:52.101
What's more shocking
than seeing your faults

28:52.167 --> 28:54.067
projected
onto a screen?

28:59.067 --> 29:01.468
Life is difficult, isn't it, Charlie Brown?

29:01.533 --> 29:02.900
Yes, it is.

29:06.900 --> 29:09.167
But I've developed
a new philosophy.

29:11.067 --> 29:13.533
I only dread one day
at a time.

29:18.001 --> 29:19.700
I feel terrible.

29:22.167 --> 29:25.667
You can't continue carrying
on like this, Charlie Brown.

29:29.167 --> 29:31.301
You're going to have to
do something about it.

29:31.368 --> 29:33.633
You're going to have
to win at something.

29:33.700 --> 29:38.001
Something that will restore
your lost self-confidence.

29:38.067 --> 29:40.267
Hey, Charlie Brown!

29:40.334 --> 29:44.401
There's a spelling bee at school
today, why don't you volunteer?

29:46.034 --> 29:47.633
That's a good idea,
Charlie Brown.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.468
If you win,

29:49.533 --> 29:51.500
it'll show everybody that
you're not a born loser.

29:51.567 --> 29:53.267
Maybe you're right,
Linus.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.001
Maybe I should volunteer.

29:55.067 --> 29:57.533
You go out
for the spelling bee?

29:58.834 --> 30:02.500
Charlie Brown, you'll just
make a fool of yourself.

30:02.567 --> 30:06.001
Besides that, you're bound
to be a complete failure.

30:12.734 --> 30:15.067
you never do
anything right

30:15.134 --> 30:18.468
you never put anything
in its place

30:18.533 --> 30:23.267
no wonder everyone
calls you failure face

30:25.700 --> 30:28.167
you're so impossibly dumb

30:28.234 --> 30:31.500
in history books your name
they'll erase

30:31.567 --> 30:36.101
or else they're bound
to call you failure face

30:38.900 --> 30:41.368
and in the race
to be stupid

30:41.434 --> 30:44.633
you've set a brand new
kind of pace

30:44.700 --> 30:49.700
we'd like to christen you
Charlie failure face

30:55.034 --> 30:57.301
By golly, I'll show 'em.

30:57.368 --> 30:59.533
I'll show 'em that I'm good at something.

31:00.468 --> 31:02.234
By golly,
I'll show 'em.

31:04.301 --> 31:07.001
<i>Maybe I will enter
the spelling bee.</i>

31:07.067 --> 31:08.368
<i>That's the sort
of thing I need</i>

31:08.434 --> 31:11.301
<i>to gain confidence
and self-esteem.</i>

31:11.368 --> 31:14.201
<i>I think I'll raise my hand
and volunteer.</i>

31:14.267 --> 31:16.034
<i>It'll be good for me.</i>

31:16.101 --> 31:19.500
<i>I think I'll just raise
my hand and volunteer.</i>

31:19.567 --> 31:21.101
My hand won't go up.

31:21.167 --> 31:22.867
My hand is smarter
than I am.

31:24.468 --> 31:25.600
Yes, ma'am.

31:26.234 --> 31:27.533
What am I doing?

31:27.600 --> 31:29.201
Am I talking to myself?

31:29.267 --> 31:32.767
Yes, ma'am. I was talking to
myself about the spelling bee.

31:35.167 --> 31:37.967
Yes, ma'am, I'd like to
be in the spelling bee.

31:38.034 --> 31:41.234
Psst, you're crazy,
don't do it.

31:41.301 --> 31:43.834
You'll just make
a fool out of yourself.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.500
I will not!

31:47.167 --> 31:50.667
Excuse me, ma'am. I was answering
one of my many detractors.

31:56.034 --> 31:57.267
<i>Well, here I am</i>

31:57.334 --> 31:58.934
<i>in the first round
of the spelling bee.</i>

31:59.001 --> 32:01.567
<i>Nobody thinks I can win
the class spelling bee,</i>

32:01.633 --> 32:03.067
<i>but I'm gonna show 'em.</i>

32:03.134 --> 32:05.134
<i>I not only know
a lot of hard words,</i>

32:05.201 --> 32:08.533
<i>but I know every spelling rule in the book.</i>

32:08.600 --> 32:11.368
<i>The only one I have trouble remembering is:</i>

32:11.434 --> 32:14.201
<i>"L" before "e"
except after "d."</i>

32:14.267 --> 32:17.301
<i>Or is it "e" before "I"
except after "g"?</i>

32:20.301 --> 32:22.767
<i>I've got to stay calm
and not get rattled.</i>

32:22.834 --> 32:24.867
<i>This is my big chance
to prove to everyone</i>

32:24.934 --> 32:27.700
<i>that I can do something.</i>

32:27.767 --> 32:29.600
<i>I don't care
if I don't actually win.</i>

32:29.667 --> 32:32.001
<i>All I want to do is get
past the first few rounds</i>

32:32.067 --> 32:34.700
<i>and make a decent showing.</i>

32:34.767 --> 32:37.533
<i>Let's see now, how does
that spelling rule go?</i>

32:38.201 --> 32:40.301
<i>Hmm.</i>

32:40.368 --> 32:42.234
<i>I guess I really
don't have to worry.</i>

32:42.301 --> 32:44.401
<i>All the words in the first
round of a spelling bee</i>

32:44.468 --> 32:46.201
<i>are usually quite easy.</i>

32:46.267 --> 32:48.434
<i>In a way, I'd almost like
to start off with a hard one.</i>

32:48.500 --> 32:51.267
<i>You know, kind of shake up the other kids?</i>

32:52.034 --> 32:54.101
<i>I feel strangely calm.</i>

32:56.767 --> 32:59.101
<i>Oh-oh, here it comes.</i>

32:59.167 --> 33:02.401
<i>It's my turn next, here's my
first word of the spelling bee.</i>

33:04.667 --> 33:07.234
"Failure"? Yes, ma'am.
That's an easy one.

33:07.301 --> 33:10.767
Boy, that's one word
he should know well.

33:10.834 --> 33:15.834
Failure.
F-a-i-l-u-r-e. Failure.

33:15.900 --> 33:17.401
I did it. I did it.

33:18.867 --> 33:19.934
Oh-oh.

33:20.001 --> 33:21.401
<i>That kid has an easy one.</i>

33:21.468 --> 33:25.934
Neighbor.
N-e-i-b-o-r. Neighbor.

33:26.001 --> 33:27.034
<i>Oh-oh.</i>

33:27.101 --> 33:29.533
<i>He's out, he missed it.
Now it's...</i>

33:31.667 --> 33:33.800
<i>This kid has a real easy one.</i>

33:33.867 --> 33:35.434
<i>He'll never miss it.</i>

33:35.500 --> 33:39.134
<i>Then I'll get a hard one
and I'll be out. Rats.</i>

33:39.201 --> 33:42.667
Charities. C-h-a-r

33:42.734 --> 33:47.667
r-t-e-i-s.
Charities.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.633
He missed it. Oh-oh.

33:50.700 --> 33:52.533
<i>I guess now it's up to me.</i>

33:52.600 --> 33:54.301
<i>It's sydney or the bush.</i>

33:54.368 --> 33:55.867
<i>Here it is.</i>

33:55.934 --> 33:58.700
Yes, ma'am,
the word is "insecure"?

33:58.767 --> 34:01.500
Yes, that's a word
I'm well acquainted with.

34:01.567 --> 34:03.167
Can you imagine?

34:03.234 --> 34:05.334
Of course
he knows that word.

34:05.401 --> 34:07.134
It's his trademark.

34:07.201 --> 34:11.833
Insecure.
I-n-s-e-c-u-r-e. Insecure.

34:24.101 --> 34:26.167
Boy, you really did it,
Charlie Brown.

34:26.234 --> 34:27.632
You are great.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.533
You're our class champion.

34:32.632 --> 34:34.368
You didn't think I could do it, did you?

34:34.434 --> 34:35.934
But I did it.

34:41.067 --> 34:43.101
And tomorrow you'll represent our class

34:43.167 --> 34:45.001
in the all-school
spelling bee.

34:45.067 --> 34:47.567
I'm going home
and really bear down.

34:47.632 --> 34:49.934
I'm going to study
the whole dictionary.

34:54.034 --> 34:56.867
This is one of the rules
I must remember.

34:56.934 --> 35:00.867
"'I' before 'e'
except after 'c'

35:00.934 --> 35:04.967
"or when sounded like 'a'
like in neighbor or way.

35:05.967 --> 35:07.967
"Words ending in 'I', 'e,'

35:08.034 --> 35:09.767
"drop the 'e'
and change the 'I'

35:09.834 --> 35:13.401
to 'y' before adding 'ing.'"

35:15.001 --> 35:18.434
"'I' before 'e'
except after 'c.'"

35:18.500 --> 35:23.401
Let's see. "I" before "e"
except after "h."

35:23.468 --> 35:26.533
No, "I" after "e"
after "c."

35:28.067 --> 35:30.368
"L" before "e" after...

35:30.434 --> 35:33.834
no, "e" before "I"
after "c."

35:33.900 --> 35:37.633
"When a word has a 'c' for
an ending like 'frolic'"

35:37.700 --> 35:38.934
or "colic"?

35:39.001 --> 35:41.867
..."or 'comic' and
'mimic' and 'picnic',

35:41.934 --> 35:44.834
you always add a 'k'
before appending."

35:44.900 --> 35:45.967
Huh?

35:46.034 --> 35:48.567
You know, sticking
an "e" for "I" or "y."

35:48.633 --> 35:50.301
Oh, sure.

35:50.368 --> 35:54.500
"For example, colicky,
frolicker, picnicker, mimicker."

35:54.567 --> 35:56.600
And hickory, dickory,
docker.

35:57.500 --> 35:58.834
On the other hand,

35:58.900 --> 36:02.468
"if softness is maintained," page 43,

36:02.533 --> 36:05.867
"then 'e' must be
retained after 'c.'"

36:05.934 --> 36:07.934
You mean before
the ending "able"?

36:08.001 --> 36:10.201
Right, that keeps
the spelling stable.

36:10.267 --> 36:11.767
So that's why.

36:11.834 --> 36:13.900
Of course,
let's try.

36:13.967 --> 36:17.867
"Noticeable, serviceable,
embraceable, replaceable,

36:17.934 --> 36:22.834
peaceable, enforceable,
pronounceable, and traceable."

36:22.900 --> 36:25.567
"Sleigh, stein,
fahrenheit."

36:26.967 --> 36:31.500
"Excepting fiery,
hierarchy, hieroglyphic."

36:31.567 --> 36:34.800
"'E-I' is also used
in special words

36:34.867 --> 36:37.034
that merit careful study."

36:37.101 --> 36:39.834
"E" before "I" after "c."

36:39.900 --> 36:41.867
"Seizure, leisure."

36:41.934 --> 36:44.001
"Seize, stein, protein.

36:44.067 --> 36:47.900
Weird, either, neither,
codeine, caffeine."

36:47.967 --> 36:52.034
"'Siege,' however,
is spelled 'I-e.'"

36:52.101 --> 36:54.567
"Otherwise use 'I-e' in thief,

36:54.633 --> 36:57.734
"believe, fiend, niece,
field, brief, grief

36:57.800 --> 37:00.600
cashier, achieve, yield."

37:02.101 --> 37:05.567
"Only one word in the
language ends in's-e-d-e'

37:05.633 --> 37:06.867
"'supersede'.

37:06.934 --> 37:09.667
"3 others end
in 'c-e-e-d'

37:09.734 --> 37:13.034
exceed, proceed,
succeed."

37:13.101 --> 37:16.900
"All others end
in 'c-e-d-e.'

37:16.967 --> 37:22.067
"Accede, concede, intercede,
precede, recede, secede.

37:22.134 --> 37:25.600
<i>"E" before "I" after "c."</i>

37:25.667 --> 37:27.600
<i>When a word ends in "c"</i>

37:27.667 --> 37:30.001
<i>like "frolic" and "picnic" and "mimic"</i>

37:30.067 --> 37:32.700
<i>insert a "k"
before adding a suffix.</i>

37:36.267 --> 37:38.600
Beginning with
"f," "I" or "y,"

37:38.667 --> 37:43.567
"e-i" is used immediately
after the letter "c."

37:43.633 --> 37:47.001
<i>The single exception
is "financier."</i>

37:47.067 --> 37:51.934
<i>"E-I" is used in words in
which it has the sound of "a."</i>

37:52.001 --> 37:54.600
<i>Or the sound of "I"
as in height,</i>

37:54.667 --> 37:57.034
<i>sleigh, stein, fahrenheit.</i>

37:57.101 --> 37:59.934
"E-I" is also used
in special words.

38:00.001 --> 38:03.667
Leisure, seizure,
seize, sheik, protein."

38:05.034 --> 38:08.934
"Weird, either, neither,
codeine, caffeine."

38:09.001 --> 38:10.134
Use "i-e" in

38:10.201 --> 38:13.468
thief, believe, fiend, field,
brief, grief,

38:13.533 --> 38:15.767
yield, achieve, cashier.

38:15.834 --> 38:19.600
Except after "c"
as in exceed, proceed,

38:19.667 --> 38:24.034
succeed, accede, concede,
intercede, precede, recede, secede.

38:27.667 --> 38:30.401
<i>"L" before "e"
except after "c."</i>

38:30.468 --> 38:33.001
<i>Let's see, before "c"...
uh...</i>

38:34.167 --> 38:39.234
Dissolve. D-i-s-o-l-v-e.

38:39.301 --> 38:40.500
Dissolve.

38:40.567 --> 38:42.600
That stupid
Charlie Brown.

38:42.667 --> 38:46.101
He's gonna get it
this time.

38:46.167 --> 38:49.267
He's up against some of the
best spellers in the school.

38:49.334 --> 38:51.067
Abrasive.

38:51.533 --> 38:54.167
A-s-b

38:55.234 --> 38:59.034
r-a-s-s-i-v.

38:59.101 --> 39:00.234
Abrasive.

39:04.368 --> 39:06.633
Stomach? Oh, stomach-ache.

39:06.700 --> 39:08.134
That's an easy one.

39:08.201 --> 39:09.434
Stomach-ache.

39:09.500 --> 39:14.900
S-t-o-m-a-c-h hyphen a-c-h-e.

39:14.967 --> 39:16.101
Stomach-ache.

39:17.334 --> 39:18.334
Phew.

39:20.201 --> 39:21.434
Embarrassment.

39:21.500 --> 39:25.767
E-m-b-a-r-a-s-s

39:25.834 --> 39:27.867
m-m-e-n-t.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.134
Embarrassment.

39:31.734 --> 39:33.401
<i>He missed it. Boy.</i>

39:34.700 --> 39:35.934
<i>Here is my turn.</i>

39:37.067 --> 39:38.767
The word is "perceive."

39:39.934 --> 39:41.401
Yes, I know the word.

39:41.468 --> 39:43.800
"L" before "e"
except after "v."

39:43.867 --> 39:48.234
Oh, boy, that blockhead
will never get this one.

39:55.267 --> 39:56.934
Uh... um...

40:01.834 --> 40:06.234
uh, perceive.
P-e-r-c-e-i-v-e.

40:06.301 --> 40:07.567
Perceive.

40:13.101 --> 40:15.600
He did it!
He did it!

40:18.567 --> 40:21.034
He's our hero!

40:21.101 --> 40:22.734
Charlie Brown did it!

40:26.600 --> 40:29.500
champion Charlie Brown

40:29.567 --> 40:32.468
that has a lovely ring

40:32.533 --> 40:35.468
something to make
a 4-column headline

40:35.533 --> 40:38.533
something the kids
can sing

40:38.600 --> 40:41.600
champion Charlie Brown,
inspired

40:41.667 --> 40:44.567
setting the whole
wide world on fire

40:44.633 --> 40:47.533
fly all the kites
break out the confetti

40:47.600 --> 40:50.533
cause all the bells
to sound

40:50.600 --> 40:53.567
he's gonna be
most definitely

40:53.633 --> 40:58.533
champion Charlie Brown

40:59.734 --> 41:02.600
he's got to be the best

41:02.667 --> 41:05.567
top of the heap
when it comes to spelling

41:05.633 --> 41:08.533
better than all the rest

41:08.600 --> 41:11.600
champion Charlie Brown
you did it

41:11.667 --> 41:14.600
if you're our blockhead boy
you did it

41:14.667 --> 41:17.567
it must be something
to not to be nothing

41:17.633 --> 41:20.533
when you get on the ground

41:20.600 --> 41:23.700
once a beginner
now he's a winner

41:23.767 --> 41:32.067
champion Charlie Brown

41:32.134 --> 41:34.167
I hate to admit it,

41:34.234 --> 41:36.667
but this could mean the
start of something great

41:36.734 --> 41:38.267
for Charlie Brown.

41:38.334 --> 41:40.334
He may have
to get an agent.

41:40.401 --> 41:42.600
Of course
he'll need an agent.

41:42.667 --> 41:46.567
Our glorious victory
must be capitalized upon.

41:46.633 --> 41:51.533
Let's see, as agent,
I shall get 10%,

41:51.600 --> 41:54.334
or is it 15%
of Charlie Brown?

41:54.401 --> 41:57.134
Perhaps this calls
for incorporation.

41:57.201 --> 41:59.167
Lucy Van Pelt, inc.

41:59.533 --> 42:00.934
Hmm.

42:01.001 --> 42:03.167
I guess you really
have to start boning up

42:03.234 --> 42:05.267
on your spelling,
Charlie Brown.

42:05.334 --> 42:09.267
Boning up?
What for? I just won.

42:09.334 --> 42:11.800
Boy, I wouldn't go through
that again for anything.

42:14.001 --> 42:15.767
What? What?

42:15.834 --> 42:17.034
What?

42:17.101 --> 42:18.600
I guess I showed 'em.

42:18.667 --> 42:21.134
I guess old Charlie Brown came through.

42:21.201 --> 42:22.334
Phew.

42:22.401 --> 42:23.967
What a relief
that's over.

42:24.034 --> 42:28.067
What?
What do you mean, over?

42:28.134 --> 42:31.134
It's over. I won.
And I won't ever have

42:31.201 --> 42:33.067
to go through
such an ordeal again.

42:34.834 --> 42:38.834
Why, you blockhead,
this is just the beginning.

42:40.201 --> 42:42.001
Of course,
Charlie Brown.

42:42.067 --> 42:43.900
This is only
the beginning.

42:43.967 --> 42:47.067
Sure, Charlie Brown,
this is only the beginning.

42:56.434 --> 43:00.301
Charlie Brown, this victory
makes you our representative

43:00.368 --> 43:05.368
to the national elimination
spelling bee, 2nd grade.

43:05.434 --> 43:09.067
National! Eliminations! Spelling bee!

43:09.134 --> 43:10.434
Ugh!

43:10.500 --> 43:13.734
Well, I can see that
this blockhead needs help.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.034
It isn't just
the nationals.

43:16.101 --> 43:19.001
There's personal appearances
after that.

43:19.067 --> 43:20.667
Testimonials.

43:20.734 --> 43:22.967
Perhaps t. v. Appearances.

43:23.034 --> 43:26.867
A manager of my caliber
is the answer, Charlie Brown.

43:29.067 --> 43:31.101
In fact,
I'm not sure

43:31.167 --> 43:34.001
if 15% is enough.

43:34.067 --> 43:38.301
My valuable presence
is easily worth 20%.

43:39.734 --> 43:41.401
Good grief.

43:41.468 --> 43:45.700
The first thing we must
correct is your posture.

43:45.767 --> 43:50.533
Judges of a contest can be
influenced by poor posture.

43:54.767 --> 43:57.468
Your grooming
is very important.

43:57.533 --> 44:00.500
Let's spruce up these
clothes, Charlie Brown.

44:01.401 --> 44:02.900
You need a haircut, too.

44:02.967 --> 44:06.267
I can see that we're going
to have to work with you.

44:06.334 --> 44:08.134
Patty,
what do you think?

44:08.201 --> 44:10.600
Well, we should
check his walk.

44:10.667 --> 44:14.401
If he's going to stumble
around like he usually does.

44:14.468 --> 44:16.201
Walk,
Charlie Brown!

44:17.001 --> 44:18.468
Not too bad.

44:18.533 --> 44:20.633
A little coaching
will help though.

44:20.700 --> 44:23.201
Too bad he doesn't have
naturally curly hair.

44:23.267 --> 44:27.101
Judges can't resist
naturally curly hair.

44:27.167 --> 44:30.500
You've gotta learn how
to smile, Charlie Brown.

44:30.567 --> 44:31.867
Smile!

44:31.934 --> 44:32.967
Hmm.

44:33.867 --> 44:35.468
Hmm.

44:35.533 --> 44:38.567
You've got a smile
like a sick pumpkin.

44:41.633 --> 44:44.967
And furthermore, you have to be understood.

44:45.034 --> 44:48.667
The judges must be able
to understand you!

44:48.734 --> 44:51.500
Your diction
must be perfect!

44:53.633 --> 44:55.700
The honor of your school,

44:55.767 --> 45:00.267
your neighborhood
rests on your shoulders.

45:00.334 --> 45:05.167
Not to mention the economic
future of your manager.

45:12.334 --> 45:16.034
Linus, I don't know
how I get into these messes.

45:16.101 --> 45:18.368
If I hadn't volunteered
in the first place,

45:18.434 --> 45:20.034
I wouldn't have won

45:20.101 --> 45:23.533
and now I wouldn't have to be
trying to memorize the dictionary.

45:23.600 --> 45:26.267
There's a good chance
that instead of being a hero,

45:26.334 --> 45:29.401
I'll make a bigger fool
of myself than ever.

45:29.468 --> 45:31.267
Don't be discouraged,
Charlie Brown,

45:31.334 --> 45:32.834
you have
nothing to lose.

45:32.900 --> 45:35.767
You'll either be a hero,
or a goat.

45:40.468 --> 45:42.767
Hi, big brother.
Hi, Linus.

45:44.267 --> 45:45.334
Hi.

45:45.401 --> 45:47.267
Hi, Sally.

45:47.334 --> 45:50.134
Why don't you
take me to a movie?

45:50.201 --> 45:52.834
How would I ever
take you to a movie?

45:52.900 --> 45:55.234
Well, this happens
all the time.

45:55.301 --> 45:56.800
Boys call up girls
and say,

45:56.867 --> 45:58.800
"would you like to go
to a movie?"

46:00.267 --> 46:01.334
And then the girls say,

46:01.401 --> 46:03.633
"why, yes,
I'd like it very much."

46:05.334 --> 46:07.468
And then the boy goes
over to the girl's house

46:07.533 --> 46:10.600
and knocks on the door

46:10.667 --> 46:13.834
and he says to her, "I've
come to take you to a movie."

46:15.667 --> 46:18.900
Have you come to take me to a movie, Linus?

46:18.967 --> 46:20.600
Good grief, no.

46:23.900 --> 46:26.234
Isn't he
the cutest thing?

46:36.067 --> 46:39.334
C-h-a-r-l-i-e!

46:39.401 --> 46:40.934
Charlie!

46:41.633 --> 46:43.934
Charlie Brown!

46:44.001 --> 46:46.600
Yeah!

46:46.667 --> 46:49.301
This whole thing makes me
feel like I'm being drafted.

46:49.368 --> 46:51.134
Think of it this way,
Charlie Brown,

46:51.201 --> 46:52.800
you're going on
a great adventure.

46:52.867 --> 46:55.800
And you'll be representing
all us little kids.

46:55.867 --> 46:57.934
Our honor is riding
on your shoulders.

46:58.001 --> 47:02.633
Not to mention my future
economic security, Charlie Brown.

47:02.700 --> 47:05.867
As your agent,
I expect nothing but success

47:05.934 --> 47:07.633
in our endeavors.

47:07.700 --> 47:10.334
Go out there,
Charlie Brown, and fight!

47:12.167 --> 47:13.834
Good grief.

47:13.900 --> 47:16.767
Ok, Charlie Brown, I guess
you'd better get aboard

47:16.834 --> 47:18.934
the bus is
about to go.

47:19.001 --> 47:23.101
Incidentally, Charlie Brown,
I want you to take this.

47:23.167 --> 47:27.101
My blanket.
My life. My all.

47:27.167 --> 47:29.101
It will bring you luck.

47:29.167 --> 47:31.533
Gee, Linus. That's very nice of you.

47:31.600 --> 47:32.600
Here.

47:32.667 --> 47:33.734
I don't think I...

47:33.800 --> 47:34.934
here.

47:36.067 --> 47:37.734
Well, ok.

47:38.700 --> 47:40.401
Thanks, Linus.
Here!

47:40.468 --> 47:41.600
So long, Linus.

47:41.667 --> 47:43.301
Here!

47:43.368 --> 47:46.867
Return victorious,
Charlie Brown!

47:46.934 --> 47:49.034
Or don't come back
at all.

47:49.101 --> 47:55.001
You can do it,
Charlie Brown!

47:55.067 --> 47:58.867
Return victorious,
Charlie Brown.

48:55.434 --> 48:58.533
Schroeder, do you think
Charlie Brown will win?

48:58.600 --> 49:01.800
Do you think that Charlie
Brown has a chance?

49:01.867 --> 49:04.001
Well, he's been
practicing a lot.

49:04.067 --> 49:06.201
I think
he has a good chance.

49:09.267 --> 49:13.368
The young man these days has
to practice a lot, doesn't he?

49:13.434 --> 49:16.633
A young man these days
has to work very hard

49:16.700 --> 49:19.600
to be able to support a wife, doesn't he?

49:19.667 --> 49:21.934
Who said anything
about a wife?

49:25.667 --> 49:28.800
Do piano players make a
lot of money, Schroeder?

49:29.468 --> 49:31.533
Some do.

49:31.600 --> 49:34.334
If they practice
very hard, I guess.

49:36.834 --> 49:39.434
Keep practicing, kiddo.

49:41.633 --> 49:43.201
Incidentally,
who is this?

49:43.267 --> 49:44.934
George washington?

53:47.101 --> 53:48.934
What's going on here?

53:51.734 --> 53:52.834
Well?

53:52.900 --> 53:54.734
I can't help it.

53:54.800 --> 53:58.401
I made the mistake of giving
my blanket to Charlie Brown

53:58.468 --> 54:01.633
to take to that spelling bee
for good luck.

54:01.700 --> 54:06.368
Now, I keep fainting.
I keep passing out.

54:06.434 --> 54:07.700
Why don't you
go outside

54:07.767 --> 54:09.700
and get a breath
of fresh air?

54:13.900 --> 54:15.001
Oh.

54:19.767 --> 54:23.533
Woe is me. I'm dying.
My race is run.

54:23.600 --> 54:27.468
Why did I let Charlie Brown
take my blanket?

54:27.533 --> 54:30.167
I've got to get
my blanket back.

54:36.301 --> 54:38.434
See, I'm always passing out.

54:39.967 --> 54:42.434
Snoopy, it's up to you to help me.

54:42.500 --> 54:45.101
I just gotta have
my blanket back.

54:45.167 --> 54:47.234
I gotta have my blanket.

54:48.468 --> 54:50.567
I don't know
what's happening to me.

54:50.633 --> 54:53.700
Maybe you can come with me
to find Charlie Brown

54:53.767 --> 54:55.967
and get my blanket back.

56:22.067 --> 56:23.368
Disgrace.

56:23.434 --> 56:27.600
D-i-s-g-r-a-c-e.

56:27.667 --> 56:29.101
Disgrace.

56:29.167 --> 56:32.500
In choosing between
"I-e" and "e-i"

56:32.567 --> 56:35.101
"e-i" is used
after the letter "c."

56:35.734 --> 56:37.267
This is too much.

56:37.334 --> 56:40.301
I'm so tired I can
hardly stay awake.

56:40.368 --> 56:43.267
Maybe I'd better go to bed.

56:43.334 --> 56:46.667
But if I give up now, the
kids will never forgive me.

56:47.500 --> 56:49.533
I can't keep up this pace.

56:50.934 --> 56:52.834
Maybe I should
just tell 'em all

56:52.900 --> 56:54.867
that my health
is more important.

56:59.067 --> 57:00.134
Yes, health.

57:00.201 --> 57:03.434
H-e-a-l-t-h. Health.

57:03.500 --> 57:07.368
I'm getting delirious.
I better get a hold on myself.

57:07.434 --> 57:09.434
I need something
in my stomach.

57:09.500 --> 57:12.468
Stomach. S-t-o-m-a-c-h.
Stomach.

57:12.533 --> 57:14.567
I'd better call room service.

57:14.633 --> 57:15.633
Service.

57:15.700 --> 57:17.934
S-e-r-v-i-c-e.
Service.

57:19.533 --> 57:22.434
Yes, service.
Yes, that's it.

57:22.500 --> 57:24.667
"I" before "e"
save after "d."

57:25.500 --> 57:27.201
Hello, yes, hello.

57:29.967 --> 57:31.667
Oh, did I ring?

57:31.734 --> 57:33.533
Yes, I guess I rang.

57:33.600 --> 57:35.667
Rang. R-a-n-g. Rang.

57:36.900 --> 57:37.900
What?

57:37.967 --> 57:40.234
Oh, yes, room service.

57:40.301 --> 57:42.533
I want room service. Ooh.

57:42.600 --> 57:46.034
Could you please send me a bowl
of dry cereal and a glass of milk?

57:46.101 --> 57:49.434
Listen, what was it?
"L" before "e" after milk?

57:55.167 --> 57:57.201
Thump. T-h-u-m-p. Thump.

58:03.800 --> 58:06.401
Hey.

58:28.900 --> 58:33.134
My blanket, Charlie Brown.
My blanket.

58:33.201 --> 58:36.633
I can't be without it.

58:36.700 --> 58:41.401
After I gave you my blanket,
my life has been a nightmare.

58:41.834 --> 58:42.934
Phew.

58:48.001 --> 58:50.934
See? I keep passing out.

58:51.001 --> 58:54.267
I can't be
without my blanket.

58:56.567 --> 58:59.734
I need my blanket,
Charlie Brown.

58:59.800 --> 59:02.834
Gee, Linus, I don't know
what's with your blanket.

59:04.301 --> 59:05.800
I've been so busy
studying

59:05.867 --> 59:07.834
that I forgot
all about your blanket.

59:07.900 --> 59:10.034
Forgot about
my blanket!

59:10.101 --> 59:11.101
Phew.

59:12.034 --> 59:15.700
Woe, woe, woe is me.

59:15.767 --> 59:17.533
Gee, I'm sorry, Linus.

59:17.600 --> 59:22.201
I really have been studying so
hard I must have misplaced it.

59:22.267 --> 59:24.967
Maybe I left it
in the lobby. Hmm.

59:26.767 --> 59:29.700
No, I think I left it
at the library.

59:29.767 --> 59:32.767
I really haven't gone any
place except for the library.

59:32.834 --> 59:35.234
That's it. I must have
left it at the library.

59:35.301 --> 59:38.900
Library!
I give him a good luck charm,

59:38.967 --> 59:41.034
my beautiful blanket,

59:41.101 --> 59:43.633
and he thinks
it's at the library.

59:44.734 --> 59:47.134
Charlie Brown,
I ought to kick you!

59:53.101 --> 59:55.700
Linus! Linus!
Speak to me.

59:55.767 --> 59:58.001
I'm sure the blanket
is at the library.

59:58.067 --> 59:59.500
Take old Snoopy
with you.

59:59.567 --> 01:00:01.267
He's a hunting dog.
He'll...

01:00:02.167 --> 01:00:03.600
good grief.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.234
Well, he'll be happy to
help you find your blanket.

01:00:08.301 --> 01:00:09.934
I have to stay
and study.

01:00:10.001 --> 01:00:13.734
Tomorrow's the spelling bee
and I just have to study.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.834
Look in the hotel
lobby first,

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.867
then go down 2 blocks,
right, then straight.

01:00:18.934 --> 01:00:20.500
You can't miss it.

01:00:20.567 --> 01:00:23.500
It's either at the library
or somewhere along the way.

01:00:32.533 --> 01:00:34.134
It isn't here.

01:00:55.134 --> 01:00:56.700
It isn't here!

01:01:06.134 --> 01:01:07.700
It isn't here!

01:01:13.368 --> 01:01:17.500
Where is it? Where can it be?

01:05:11.034 --> 01:05:14.001
Where is it?
I don't see it.

01:05:14.934 --> 01:05:16.767
It isn't here.

01:05:19.834 --> 01:05:24.267
It's gone.
My poor blanket is gone.

01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:29.533
Woe is me. I'm sunk.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.401
That scoundrel, Charlie
Brown, lost my blanket.

01:05:45.001 --> 01:05:47.767
All right, you stupid beagle, snap to it!

01:05:47.834 --> 01:05:51.267
You've been no help at all
in finding my blanket.

01:05:55.334 --> 01:05:58.134
Some hunting dog!

01:05:58.201 --> 01:06:02.401
The world is ending and he
can't even help find a blanket.

01:06:05.034 --> 01:06:08.633
It's that blockhead
Charlie Brown's fault.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.334
If I hadn't
felt sorry for him,

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:13.600
this would
never have happened.

01:06:13.667 --> 01:06:17.001
Never feel sorry
for blockheads!

01:06:17.067 --> 01:06:20.101
I'll never forgive
that Charlie Brown.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.700
Good morning, Linus
and Snoopy.

01:06:32.767 --> 01:06:36.800
Snoopy, S-n-o-o-p-y. Snoopy.

01:06:36.867 --> 01:06:39.334
Well, Charlie Brown,
you really did it.

01:06:41.067 --> 01:06:44.101
We looked for that blanket
all over the city.

01:06:46.067 --> 01:06:48.900
And as for this
hunting dog of yours,

01:06:48.967 --> 01:06:51.234
he's completely useless.

01:06:51.301 --> 01:06:56.234
Useless.
U-s-e-l-e-s-s. Useless.

01:06:58.101 --> 01:06:59.633
Gee, I'm sorry, Linus.

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.201
I don't know what to say.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:02.967
S-a-y. Say.

01:07:04.134 --> 01:07:06.734
I've got to get ready
for the contest.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:12.301
Contest.
C-o-n-t-e-s-t. Contest.

01:07:12.368 --> 01:07:16.201
I'll never see
my blanket again.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:21.734
Washing.
W-a-s-h-i-n-g. Washing.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.167
Ugh!

01:09:03.267 --> 01:09:06.067
"I" before "e"
when followed by "c."

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.834
Good luck, Charlie Brown.

01:09:37.167 --> 01:09:40.134
Hi. I'm a friend
of one of the contestants.

01:09:59.633 --> 01:10:02.468
I'm a friend of one
of the contestants.

01:10:24.468 --> 01:10:26.934
That blockhead
better deliver.

01:10:27.001 --> 01:10:31.001
I'm sure Charlie Brown
will perform commendably.

01:10:31.067 --> 01:10:33.101
It's gonna start.
Here it is.

01:10:33.167 --> 01:10:36.334
It's sydney or the bush
for Charlie Brown.

01:10:46.967 --> 01:10:52.468
When a word ends in "c," a "k"
is added before "e," "i," or "y."

01:10:52.533 --> 01:10:55.867
That blockhead.
He's falling asleep.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.700
Supersede.

01:11:04.767 --> 01:11:08.401
S-u-p-e-r

01:11:08.468 --> 01:11:13.334
s-e-d-e. Supersede.

01:11:16.034 --> 01:11:17.600
Irritable.

01:11:17.667 --> 01:11:22.533
I-r-r-i-t-i-b-l-e.

01:11:23.034 --> 01:11:24.134
Irritable.

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:30.800
Recommend.

01:11:30.867 --> 01:11:35.700
R-e-c-o-m-m-e-n-d.

01:11:36.301 --> 01:11:37.500
Recommend.

01:11:39.967 --> 01:11:41.434
Invitation.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.767
I-n-v-i-t-a-t-i-o-n.

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:47.234
Invitation.

01:11:52.201 --> 01:11:53.468
Unconfident.

01:11:53.533 --> 01:11:57.434
U-n-c-o-n-f-i-d-e-n-t.

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.034
Unconfident.

01:11:59.101 --> 01:12:03.334
Of course, that's a word
he's well acquainted with.

01:12:03.401 --> 01:12:05.134
Production.

01:12:05.201 --> 01:12:09.533
P-r-o-d-u-c-t

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.434
I-o-n.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.767
Production.

01:12:15.167 --> 01:12:16.700
Tyranny.

01:12:16.767 --> 01:12:20.900
T-y-r-r-a-n-y.

01:12:20.967 --> 01:12:22.067
Tyranny.

01:12:26.234 --> 01:12:27.800
Indispensable.

01:12:28.468 --> 01:12:32.034
I-n-d-i-s-p

01:12:32.101 --> 01:12:35.800
e-n-s-i-b-i-e.

01:12:35.867 --> 01:12:37.667
Indispensable.

01:12:40.101 --> 01:12:41.368
Irresistible.

01:12:41.434 --> 01:12:46.500
I-r-r-e-s-i-s

01:12:46.567 --> 01:12:50.067
t-a-b-l-e.

01:12:50.134 --> 01:12:51.667
Irresistible.

01:12:56.267 --> 01:12:57.401
Repetition.

01:12:57.468 --> 01:13:02.700
R-e-p-e-t-i-o-n.

01:13:02.767 --> 01:13:04.201
Repetition.

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:09.734
Development.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:14.667
D-e-v-e-l-o-p-m-e-n-t.

01:13:15.767 --> 01:13:17.334
Development.

01:13:19.533 --> 01:13:21.034
Ingenious.

01:13:21.101 --> 01:13:26.001
I-n-g-e-n-u-o-u-s.

01:13:31.401 --> 01:13:33.434
Fussbudget.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:37.234
F-u-s-s-b-u-d-g-e-t.

01:13:37.867 --> 01:13:39.667
Fussbudget.

01:13:39.734 --> 01:13:42.001
Hey, how did he know
that word?

01:13:43.734 --> 01:13:45.234
Irremediable.

01:13:46.034 --> 01:13:49.101
I-r-r-e-m

01:13:49.167 --> 01:13:52.834
I-d-a-b-i-e.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.401
Irremediable.

01:13:55.301 --> 01:13:57.934
Hey, there's only
2 left!

01:13:58.001 --> 01:14:00.401
And one of them
is Charlie Brown!

01:14:00.468 --> 01:14:02.334
Hooray!

01:14:04.867 --> 01:14:06.468
That a boy, Charlie Brown!

01:14:06.533 --> 01:14:08.201
You can do it.

01:14:08.267 --> 01:14:12.934
Wee, the stage, t. v.,
nothing will stop us.

01:14:13.001 --> 01:14:14.167
Disastrous.

01:14:14.234 --> 01:14:18.101
D-i-s-a-s-t-r-o-u-s.

01:14:18.167 --> 01:14:19.567
Disastrous.

01:14:19.633 --> 01:14:22.967
Yeah, Charlie Brown,
hang on there!

01:14:24.567 --> 01:14:25.934
Occurrence.

01:14:26.001 --> 01:14:31.368
O-c-c-u-r-r-e-n-c-e.

01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:33.067
Occurrence.

01:14:35.301 --> 01:14:37.468
It's Charlie Brown's turn.

01:14:37.533 --> 01:14:40.667
If he gets this one,
and the other kid misses,

01:14:40.734 --> 01:14:43.500
why, he could be the winner.

01:14:45.301 --> 01:14:48.468
Come on, Charlie Brown.
You can do it!

01:14:48.533 --> 01:14:50.034
Incompetent.

01:14:50.101 --> 01:14:54.401
I-n-c-o-m-p-e-t-e-n-t.

01:14:54.468 --> 01:14:56.067
Incompetent.

01:14:56.134 --> 01:14:59.967
Hooray!
Charlie Brown is doing it!

01:15:00.034 --> 01:15:01.301
Hooray!

01:15:01.368 --> 01:15:04.468
I think he's gonna do it.
Hooray!

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:06.800
My future is assured.

01:15:06.867 --> 01:15:08.934
Do you think
he'll do it, Schroeder?

01:15:09.001 --> 01:15:10.500
I hope so.

01:15:10.567 --> 01:15:14.767
If the other kid misses this
next one, Charlie Brown wins.

01:15:14.834 --> 01:15:16.867
Come on, Charlie Brown!

01:15:16.934 --> 01:15:19.734
You can do it, Charlie Brown!

01:15:23.001 --> 01:15:24.034
Leisure.

01:15:24.101 --> 01:15:27.667
L-e-i-s-u-r-e.

01:15:27.734 --> 01:15:28.934
Leisure.

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:33.267
The word is "beagle"?

01:15:33.334 --> 01:15:36.500
Oh, boy. That's an easy one.

01:15:36.567 --> 01:15:38.267
That's his dog.

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:40.267
He'll get that one easy.

01:15:40.334 --> 01:15:44.767
Charlie Brown's at the threshold
of being a champion speller!

01:15:44.834 --> 01:15:46.101
Beagle.

01:15:47.434 --> 01:15:48.434
Beagle.

01:15:49.834 --> 01:15:52.900
B-e-a-g-e-l.

01:15:52.967 --> 01:15:54.201
Beagle.

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:58.734
Ugh!

01:16:04.867 --> 01:16:07.633
Owning 10% of Charlie Brown

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:10.967
is like owning
10% of nothing.

01:16:14.468 --> 01:16:18.834
Charlie Brown,
you, you make me mad!

01:17:57.101 --> 01:18:00.734
I guess nobody realized
that we were returning.

01:18:02.767 --> 01:18:05.500
Come on, Charlie Brown, let's go home.

01:18:23.767 --> 01:18:25.267
So long, Charlie Brown.

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:26.600
See you tomorrow.

01:20:10.301 --> 01:20:11.900
Oh, hi, Linus.

01:20:11.967 --> 01:20:14.301
Did you come
to take me to a movie?

01:20:14.368 --> 01:20:19.067
There's one downtown,
for mature audiences only.

01:20:19.134 --> 01:20:21.067
Good grief, no.

01:20:21.134 --> 01:20:23.500
I came to see Charlie Brown.

01:20:23.567 --> 01:20:24.867
Is he here?

01:20:24.934 --> 01:20:26.767
Yes, he's in his room.

01:20:28.834 --> 01:20:33.301
He's been in bed all day and
has the shades pulled down.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:41.034
Well, if you decide you
want to take me to a movie,

01:20:41.101 --> 01:20:43.167
you have my phone number.

01:20:48.067 --> 01:20:49.368
Who is it?

01:20:49.434 --> 01:20:52.900
It's me, Linus.
May I come in?

01:20:52.967 --> 01:20:54.468
I don't care.

01:20:59.667 --> 01:21:02.567
It's dark in here.
I can't see a thing.

01:21:02.633 --> 01:21:04.700
You mind if I
pull the shades up?

01:21:04.767 --> 01:21:06.301
I don't care.

01:21:11.134 --> 01:21:15.267
You weren't in school today, Charlie
Brown. All the kids missed you.

01:21:15.334 --> 01:21:19.134
I'm never going to school
again as long as I live.

01:21:19.201 --> 01:21:21.101
We had a ballgame
after school.

01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:22.334
I don't care.

01:21:22.401 --> 01:21:24.500
I'm never going to
play ball either.

01:21:24.567 --> 01:21:26.734
I'm never going to do
anything again.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.234
It's the first game
we've won all season.

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:31.600
Oh, brother.

01:21:31.667 --> 01:21:34.567
Well, I can understand
how you feel.

01:21:34.633 --> 01:21:37.600
You worked hard
studying for the spelling bee,

01:21:37.667 --> 01:21:40.700
and I suppose you feel
you let everyone down

01:21:40.767 --> 01:21:44.101
and you made a fool of
yourself and everything.

01:21:48.201 --> 01:21:50.667
But, did you notice
something, Charlie Brown?

01:21:50.734 --> 01:21:52.301
What's that?

01:21:52.368 --> 01:21:54.368
The world didn't
come to an end.

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:13.533
<i>now the shadows
of the morning</i>

01:23:16.633 --> 01:23:21.600
<i>have gone beyond
the august afternoon</i>

01:23:23.734 --> 01:23:27.767
<i>and Charlie's had his day</i>

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.767
<i>his very special day</i>

01:23:33.267 --> 01:23:37.967
<i>his morning and his evening
and his noon</i>

01:23:41.201 --> 01:23:46.101
<i>maybe it's a kind of magic</i>

01:23:49.167 --> 01:23:54.034
<i>that only
little boys can do</i>

01:23:55.667 --> 01:24:00.633
<i>but seeing Charlie smile</i>

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:05.267
<i>can make you stop a while</i>

01:24:05.334 --> 01:24:10.034
<i>and get you
feeling glad you're you</i>

01:24:12.934 --> 01:24:18.900
<i>he's only a boy
named Charlie</i>

01:24:18.967 --> 01:24:21.800
Welcome home,
Charlie Brown.

01:24:21.867 --> 01:24:26.500
<i>a boy named Charlie Brown</i>

01:24:29.201 --> 01:24:31.934
<i>he's just the kid
next door</i>

01:24:32.001 --> 01:24:35.368
<i>perhaps a little more</i>

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:41.800
<i>he's every kid
in every town</i>

01:24:45.334 --> 01:24:49.834
<i>the world is full
of lots of people</i>

01:24:53.401 --> 01:24:58.301
<i>here and there
and all around</i>

01:25:00.001 --> 01:25:03.834
<i>but people after all</i>

01:25:04.934 --> 01:25:08.234
<i>start out as bein' small</i>

01:25:09.267 --> 01:25:12.201
<i>and we're all</i>

01:25:12.267 --> 01:25:14.867
<i>a boy named</i>

01:25:14.934 --> 01:25:18.667
<i>Charlie Brown</i>
