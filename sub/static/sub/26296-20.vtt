Isn't that
the universal donor?

Gus can only receive blood
of the exact same type he has.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.972
And until we find enough donors,
we can't operate.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.729

will that take?

38:35.191 --> 38:37.752
So far, we've found
four potential donors.

everything we can

what was wrong, but he did,

told Teddy that you loved her,

24 hours previously,

40:53.550 --> 40:55.213
you had been in bed
