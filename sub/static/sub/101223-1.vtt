00:00.291 --> 00:02.874
(upbeat music)

00:22.427 --> 00:25.427
(suspenseful music)

01:44.543 --> 01:46.793
- Hey, where are you going?

01:49.251 --> 01:50.668
- The hell is it.

01:53.084 --> 01:55.334
- What are you looking for?

01:57.206 --> 02:01.789
- Try the outside pocket (indistinct).

02:10.542 --> 02:12.625
(snorts)

02:47.007 --> 02:49.257
- How did this get in here?

02:51.493 --> 02:52.326
- I don't know.

02:52.326 --> 02:54.250
I just packed everything from
the top drawer, like you said,

02:54.250 --> 02:56.050
you know, we packed in such a hurry.

03:01.027 --> 03:05.944
- Its (indistinct)

03:08.303 --> 03:10.636
I miss him so much already.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.033
- I know.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.907
- We need to go back and get him.

03:22.925 --> 03:27.050
- Hey, you know that's not possible, okay.

03:27.050 --> 03:28.940
- I just can't leave him in that house,

03:28.940 --> 03:30.587
My parents they'll...

03:32.440 --> 03:37.370
- Hey, hey they never did
anything to him, only you.

03:38.640 --> 03:39.760
He's gonna be okay.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.850
Look, I'm going to clean this
up, why don't you look at

03:45.237 --> 03:48.084
and you can know you'll be okay.

03:48.084 --> 03:48.917
- Yeah.

04:06.793 --> 04:09.210
(soft music)

04:30.994 --> 04:31.827
Shit.

04:42.927 --> 04:45.927
(suspenseful music)

05:10.815 --> 05:11.732
- You lost?

05:13.086 --> 05:14.786
You were gone for like 20 minutes.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.570
Take your pill today?

05:20.160 --> 05:20.993
- This morning.

05:21.950 --> 05:22.873
It's my last one.

05:24.690 --> 05:26.880
- Okay, once we're out on the
road, we'll get more okay?

05:26.880 --> 05:27.713
- How?

05:28.710 --> 05:29.810
- We'll figure it out.

05:35.986 --> 05:38.319
- I mean, it's a nice house.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.110
- We'll have a house like this someday.

05:41.980 --> 05:42.813
- Yeah.

05:46.131 --> 05:47.879
(dramatic music)

05:47.879 --> 05:48.879
- Goddammit!

05:54.788 --> 05:57.690
He's not coming, I told
you we couldn't trust him.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.770
I fucking told you.

05:59.770 --> 06:01.140
- Tyler said he would be here, okay.

06:01.140 --> 06:03.434
Now we just need to be patient.

06:03.434 --> 06:04.735
(dramatic music)

06:04.735 --> 06:05.568
- Fuck!

06:09.210 --> 06:10.043
- What is it?

06:13.710 --> 06:17.577
- Nothing, someone walked
by and I freaked out..

06:19.952 --> 06:21.803
- Oh, baby,

06:22.650 --> 06:23.840
baby, baby, baby.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.910
Hey, Tyler said he would be here.

06:26.910 --> 06:27.743
Okay.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.300
Just be patient, these things take time.

06:31.300 --> 06:34.800
- So then yesterday and the day before.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.720
- Look, it takes a while
to get new identities

06:36.720 --> 06:38.010
for three people.

06:38.010 --> 06:38.973
- For two days?

06:40.490 --> 06:43.314
- Do you want me to call
him and see where he's at?

06:43.314 --> 06:46.713
- No, they'll track us, no phones.

06:50.354 --> 06:51.700
(dramatic music)

06:51.700 --> 06:54.593
- Wait, you said you got rid of yours?

06:55.510 --> 06:56.570
- Oh, fuck yeah, I did.

06:56.570 --> 06:59.233
I smashed it, it's just
force of habit that's all.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.160
- Oh yeah.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.683
- Look, come on, let's go.

07:05.900 --> 07:06.733
- Alright.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.980
- Hey, you were just high

07:09.980 --> 07:12.160
and you know how you get some times?

07:12.160 --> 07:15.020
- No, it's not that we're
gonna get through this.

07:15.890 --> 07:17.129
Come on.

07:17.129 --> 07:17.980
(dramatic music)

07:17.980 --> 07:19.283
- Shit, shit shit.

07:21.230 --> 07:22.263
- Remy, what the hell.

07:22.263 --> 07:27.263
- People can see in, do you mind helping?

07:29.720 --> 07:30.686
- One sec.

07:30.686 --> 07:32.024
- This is important.

07:32.024 --> 07:33.107
- So is this.

07:37.683 --> 07:39.527
- Hey, hey, just let me.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.410
All fixed.

07:58.410 --> 07:59.243
- Thanks.

08:01.720 --> 08:06.720
Why don't you chill out a
bit and have a drink with me.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.063
- Who else knows we're here?

08:10.570 --> 08:12.067
- Nobody, okay?

08:12.067 --> 08:14.630
. What if Tyler told someone?

08:14.630 --> 08:16.880
- Tyler would not do that.

08:16.880 --> 08:17.903
It's gonna be fine.

08:20.790 --> 08:22.140
This will all be over soon.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.893
- This will never really be over.

08:26.090 --> 08:27.433
Not after what we did.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.870
We're gonna be looking over our shoulders

08:29.870 --> 08:31.360
for our entire lives.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.210
- That's not true.

08:32.210 --> 08:34.260
This will all be a memory one day.

08:34.260 --> 08:36.230
It's gonna be you and me.

08:36.230 --> 08:38.040
It's gonna be a sick fucking bad dream

08:38.040 --> 08:39.580
once Tyler comes to get us,

08:39.580 --> 08:41.570
he's gonna get us outta here.

08:41.570 --> 08:44.080
- I don't see why we can't just leave now.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.460
Its you and me.

08:45.460 --> 08:46.693
- We talked about this.

08:47.950 --> 08:50.420
Remember the plan we need, Tyler.

08:50.420 --> 08:53.593
We can't just go just until
we get to Austin, okay.

08:57.230 --> 08:59.350
Then we can have our honeymoon.

08:59.350 --> 09:00.400
Just like we planned.

09:05.770 --> 09:07.623
When I took those vows, I meant them.

09:08.950 --> 09:09.950
Now you're all mine.

09:11.940 --> 09:13.670
We're gonna get through this.

09:13.670 --> 09:15.440
Just gon' be you and me.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.857
(soft music)

09:28.452 --> 09:29.285
Come here.

09:30.321 --> 09:33.478
(suspenseful music)

09:33.478 --> 09:34.395
Just relax.

10:08.781 --> 10:10.090
- What is it?

10:10.090 --> 10:13.757
- You're so fucking
beautiful you know that.

10:17.903 --> 10:19.486
Hmm that's my girl.

10:49.093 --> 10:50.023
- What was that?

10:52.330 --> 10:53.800
- What was what?

10:53.800 --> 10:54.633
- That noise.

10:55.650 --> 10:56.730
- It's probably just the fridge.

10:56.730 --> 10:58.353
- No, I heard footsteps.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.640
- Baby, nobody else is here.

11:00.640 --> 11:02.499
Its just me and you.

11:02.499 --> 11:03.349
- No, I heard it.

11:04.827 --> 11:08.439
- Just relax, okay?

11:08.439 --> 11:10.700
Just relax.

11:10.700 --> 11:14.440
- I'm sorry, I'm just not in
the right head space right now

11:14.440 --> 11:15.273
to mess around.

11:17.380 --> 11:19.719
- Fine, I get it.

11:19.719 --> 11:24.719
Hey, I get it.

11:28.799 --> 11:31.213
- Hey, come here.

11:33.580 --> 11:36.073
Thank you for saying I'm beautiful.

11:38.130 --> 11:38.963
- Well, you are.

12:24.718 --> 12:26.885
(moaning)

13:48.317 --> 13:51.317
(suspenseful music)

13:53.696 --> 13:55.863
(sobbing)

13:59.713 --> 14:02.796
(suspenseful music)

14:44.351 --> 14:45.184
- Sam?

14:48.350 --> 14:49.183
Hello.

14:51.790 --> 14:52.623
Sam.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.650
Where are you?

14:55.650 --> 14:56.675
Sam.

14:56.675 --> 14:58.373
Hello.

14:58.373 --> 15:01.351
(suspenseful music)

15:01.351 --> 15:06.351
Sam.

15:18.229 --> 15:23.229
In there?

15:34.685 --> 15:35.518
Hello.

15:37.674 --> 15:39.704
Sam.

15:39.704 --> 15:42.204
(door creaks)

16:06.885 --> 16:07.885
Who's there?

16:09.915 --> 16:10.748
Hello.

16:12.454 --> 16:13.287
Sam.

16:18.820 --> 16:22.073
- The lady lives here has such good taste.

16:24.110 --> 16:25.200
- We're making a mess.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.560
What's gonna happen when
the people who live here,

16:26.560 --> 16:27.393
come back.

16:27.393 --> 16:29.800
- Oh, come on, we'll be long gone by then.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.070
- What are you doing?

16:31.070 --> 16:32.650
Don't put that on.

16:32.650 --> 16:35.100
- What is one dress, she's
not even gonna notice.

16:36.900 --> 16:41.313
And besides, I think it looks
way better on me anyways,

16:43.440 --> 16:45.793
- You look, credible.

16:50.030 --> 16:51.480
- Hey, I got one for you too.

16:53.350 --> 16:54.183
Try this on.

16:54.183 --> 16:55.343
- I don't want to.

16:57.088 --> 16:59.900
- What you want to be hold
up here and not have any fun?

16:59.900 --> 17:02.523
- Sam, please, it's not right.

17:04.230 --> 17:05.703
- Fine, I'll put it back.

17:16.990 --> 17:18.200
- Did Tyler say anything about the people

17:18.200 --> 17:19.603
whose house this is?

17:20.912 --> 17:22.500
- (sighing) only that
they're gonna be in Germany

17:22.500 --> 17:23.700
for like the next month.

17:27.270 --> 17:29.520
- Wonder what they're like.

17:53.901 --> 17:55.318
- Hey, what's up.

17:57.792 --> 18:00.129
- Do I look different?

18:00.129 --> 18:01.550
- Different, what do you mean?

18:01.550 --> 18:03.300
- When people see me.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.040
They're gonna know what I've done.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.410
- First of all, you
didn't do anything, okay?

18:07.410 --> 18:08.243
You weren't even there.

18:08.243 --> 18:10.120
- But it was my idea.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.700
I came up with the plan.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.500
- We came up with the plan together.

18:14.744 --> 18:16.330
- I wish we never did.

18:16.330 --> 18:18.300
- Are you fucking insane?

18:18.300 --> 18:20.530
After everything that prick did you?

18:20.530 --> 18:22.710
And all Tyler and I did
was rough him up a bit.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.563
He deserves way more than that.

18:25.460 --> 18:29.773
- My mom, she must've been so frightened.

18:31.230 --> 18:32.870
I keep thinking what she
must have gone through

18:32.870 --> 18:34.103
being tied up like that.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.633
- That bitch deserved just as much as him.

18:40.330 --> 18:42.090
- But her heart.

18:42.090 --> 18:43.373
She has that condition.

18:44.770 --> 18:45.870
- She's gonna be fine.

19:00.590 --> 19:01.423
- Hey.

19:05.220 --> 19:06.703
- You do look different.

19:06.703 --> 19:08.280
- How?

19:08.280 --> 19:10.823
Well, no one can touch you anymore.

19:12.430 --> 19:13.363
You're free.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.593
And you've never been more stunning.

19:20.163 --> 19:22.300
Do you know how much I fucking love you?

19:22.300 --> 19:23.217
I love you.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.293
Sam.

19:33.560 --> 19:34.977
Promise me again,

19:36.140 --> 19:37.490
you'll always keep me safe.

19:39.020 --> 19:42.950
- Hey, as long as there
are stars in that sky.

19:42.950 --> 19:44.693
I'm here to take care of you.

19:47.040 --> 19:47.873
Okay?

20:22.390 --> 20:25.289
(dramatic music)

20:25.289 --> 20:29.393
Sam, in the doorway.

20:32.411 --> 20:33.420
Right, what is it?

20:33.420 --> 20:35.741
There was a man in a mask.

20:35.741 --> 20:39.396
He was standing right
there, in the doorway.

20:39.396 --> 20:40.229
- A man?

20:40.229 --> 20:42.083
- Yes he was standing right there.

20:42.083 --> 20:44.400
- Hey, just breath.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.400
We're alone, there's nobody here.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.240
- No he was standing right there.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.223
I saw him.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.150
- Just need you to chill out.

20:53.150 --> 20:55.197
We're okay, we are alone here.

20:55.197 --> 20:56.573
- Man I saw him.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.633
- Okay, okay.

20:59.633 --> 21:00.810
Do you want me to go check?

21:01.780 --> 21:04.510
- Wait, don't go out there.

21:04.510 --> 21:08.593
- Hey, I'm gonna be fine,
there's nobody here.

21:09.570 --> 21:10.483
Just chill.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.720
(suspenseful music)

21:54.350 --> 21:55.933
- Free me, help me.

22:00.824 --> 22:02.241
Free me, help me.

22:43.962 --> 22:45.879
- You're hallucinating.

22:47.744 --> 22:49.827
This is all in your head.

23:01.745 --> 23:03.078
- Remy, help me.

23:04.155 --> 23:06.670
(screaming)

23:06.670 --> 23:07.503
Sam.

23:09.976 --> 23:10.976
Please stop.

23:31.922 --> 23:32.755
Stop.

23:34.563 --> 23:35.396
Please.

23:37.189 --> 23:38.022
Stop it.

23:42.539 --> 23:45.539
(suspenseful music)

24:20.920 --> 24:22.761
- You're going to die here.

24:22.761 --> 24:25.094
(screaming)

24:27.657 --> 24:30.062
- There's someone in this
house, we have to go.

24:30.062 --> 24:32.830
- Hey, there's nobody here, I
just checked the entire place.

24:32.830 --> 24:33.663
- I dint care we have to leave.

24:33.663 --> 24:34.498
Its not safe.

24:34.498 --> 24:35.570
- Goddammit you know we can't do that,

24:35.570 --> 24:37.240
not until Tyler gets here.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.073
- We can meet him somewhere else.

24:38.073 --> 24:39.840
Just not in this house.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.877
- How are we gonna contact them,
we have no phones remember?

24:42.877 --> 24:43.710
(crying)

24:43.710 --> 24:45.720
- Baby, all right chill.

24:45.720 --> 24:46.703
It's only us.

24:47.830 --> 24:50.258
Hey, when was the last time you slept?

24:50.258 --> 24:51.920
- I don't remember.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.880
- Come on you're going to lay down.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.039
- Oh no, not in that room.

24:56.039 --> 24:57.660
- Hey, well you need take a nap.

24:57.660 --> 25:00.260
- All right well just not in that room.

25:00.260 --> 25:02.170
- All right, there's the bedroom upstairs.

25:02.170 --> 25:03.493
Lets go, come on.

25:09.286 --> 25:11.460
what are you waiting for?

25:11.460 --> 25:12.863
- You checked every room?

25:14.090 --> 25:16.103
- Twice, now would you come on?

25:30.130 --> 25:31.490
Okay.

25:31.490 --> 25:32.473
Now this is better.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.193
Lay down.

25:35.588 --> 25:36.823
I don't feel tired.

25:38.020 --> 25:40.443
Everything is foggy but still so weird.

25:41.860 --> 25:43.570
- That's why you need a rest.

25:43.570 --> 25:44.930
Now lay down.

25:44.930 --> 25:47.350
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

25:47.350 --> 25:48.951
Why don't you take of these.

25:48.951 --> 25:50.118
- I can do it.

25:50.994 --> 25:51.827
- Okay.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.570
I'm gonna wake you okay,
up when Tyler gets here.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.773
- Now won't you lay with me?

26:11.773 --> 26:14.377
Just do I fall asleep?

26:14.377 --> 26:15.210
Of course.

26:28.286 --> 26:31.286
(suspenseful music)

29:25.317 --> 29:27.567
(snorting)

29:47.186 --> 29:50.186
(suspenseful music)

31:00.224 --> 31:02.807
(upbeat music)

32:02.187 --> 32:03.070
- Shit.

32:03.070 --> 32:04.272
- Calling your name.

32:04.272 --> 32:06.740
- Yeah I couldn't hear you
through the headphones.

32:06.740 --> 32:09.240
These people have a pretty
dope record collection.

32:12.670 --> 32:14.293
I'm definitely gonna keep these.

32:15.510 --> 32:17.280
- We don't have a record player.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.870
- Not yet.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.180
- When we do I'll get to our new house.

32:20.180 --> 32:21.630
I'm gonna buy one right away.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.640
- He's still not here, huh?

32:25.640 --> 32:26.823
- No, no.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.700
- Do we have any more crystal?

32:30.915 --> 32:33.743
- Oh yeah, there's one more
baggy left in the suitcase.

32:35.380 --> 32:37.300
- Hey, should maybe
slow down a little bit.

32:37.300 --> 32:39.250
That's that's the last of it, you know.

32:40.540 --> 32:42.570
- We'll be on the road soon, right?

32:42.570 --> 32:43.580
You promised.

32:43.580 --> 32:46.060
- Yeah but, there's like
2000 miles between us

32:46.060 --> 32:49.060
and our destination, you
might not be able to score.

32:49.060 --> 32:50.510
- Maybe Tyler will have some.

32:52.270 --> 32:53.103
- Maybe.

32:54.290 --> 32:55.340
Hey, how'd you sleep?

32:56.330 --> 32:57.580
- I had that dream again.

33:00.840 --> 33:02.140
One where I'm under water.

33:07.790 --> 33:08.623
- Was I there?

33:10.700 --> 33:11.783
- Usually you are,

33:14.600 --> 33:16.500
you always pull me out from the water.

33:19.370 --> 33:20.497
Not this time,

33:23.170 --> 33:24.850
this time I was all alone.

33:24.850 --> 33:26.703
- Hey, I'm here now.

33:28.021 --> 33:29.921
And I will be for as long as I breath.

33:34.930 --> 33:37.330
- First I was frightened.

33:37.330 --> 33:39.450
Brushing under the water like that

33:41.810 --> 33:44.023
surface just inches
away from my fingertips.

33:47.175 --> 33:48.973
Yet it seems so far away.

33:57.475 --> 33:59.725
How well do you know Tyler?

34:01.685 --> 34:02.635
- What do you mean?

34:03.670 --> 34:05.620
- Mean how well do you really know him?

34:07.760 --> 34:10.640
- Tyler has at least been
there for me, you know that.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.140
- But he has the money, right?

34:14.340 --> 34:16.860
What makes you think he
didn't just run off with it?

34:16.860 --> 34:18.960
- He wouldn't do that, okay?

34:18.960 --> 34:19.860
- How do you know?

34:23.670 --> 34:26.573
- Look, I told you about that
foster home I was in, right?

34:28.130 --> 34:30.973
He was the only person that
would look out for me there.

34:33.360 --> 34:35.073
He's just always been there for me.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.460
- Money changes people.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.670
- Not Tyler.

34:41.670 --> 34:43.070
- Then where the fuck is he?

34:44.352 --> 34:45.602
- I don't know.

34:59.583 --> 35:00.933
- Did you fuck him?

35:04.420 --> 35:05.844
- What?

35:05.844 --> 35:08.063
- Did you and Tyler ever have sex?

35:09.840 --> 35:11.210
- You fucking serious right now?

35:11.210 --> 35:12.818
- Is that a no?

35:12.818 --> 35:14.668
- Look, it was a long time ago, okay.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.763
It was years before I ever met you.

35:27.975 --> 35:29.243
- Figured as much.

35:32.503 --> 35:34.230
- The way you always talk about him.

35:34.230 --> 35:35.710
- Tyler's like a brother to me.

35:35.710 --> 35:36.643
- A brother who left us both to rot.

35:36.643 --> 35:39.723
- You're not fucking
fair, he's gonna be here.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.073
Goddammit.

35:45.850 --> 35:46.683
Shit.

35:50.980 --> 35:52.173
- Tyler's dead.

35:53.290 --> 35:55.039
- He's burning in hell.

35:55.039 --> 35:58.206
- What the fuck are you talking about?

35:59.151 --> 36:00.609
- I don't feel so well.

36:00.609 --> 36:02.192
- Shit, your pills.

36:03.050 --> 36:04.269
- They're gone I told you.

36:04.269 --> 36:05.352
- Remy, Remy!

36:08.247 --> 36:09.164
No, no, no.

36:12.718 --> 36:14.468
Remy, Remy I got you.

36:44.680 --> 36:45.887
- What's going on.

36:45.887 --> 36:47.213
- You had a seizure.

36:52.548 --> 36:53.381
Sit up.

36:56.349 --> 36:57.794
Where are we?

36:57.794 --> 37:00.635
- At the steak house baby.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.085
Everything's okay, I got you.

37:04.241 --> 37:05.141
That was so scary.

37:07.370 --> 37:08.203
- Sam.

37:09.125 --> 37:09.958
- Yeah.

37:10.867 --> 37:13.074
- You're gonna suffer for your sins.

37:13.074 --> 37:13.907
- What?

37:13.907 --> 37:15.422
- You're gonna burn in hell.

37:15.422 --> 37:16.718
You're going to burn.

37:16.718 --> 37:19.478
Burn, you're gonna burn.

37:19.478 --> 37:20.878
- Get off me.

37:20.878 --> 37:23.878
(suspenseful music)

37:32.069 --> 37:35.402
- You're gonna pay for what you've done.

37:37.018 --> 37:38.127
- Remy, what the fuck are you doing?

37:38.127 --> 37:39.794
Put that thing down.

37:40.847 --> 37:43.180
(screaming)

37:57.103 --> 38:00.103
(suspenseful music)

39:34.172 --> 39:36.589
(soft music)

39:54.950 --> 39:57.533
(upbeat music)

41:43.584 --> 41:46.265
- You gotta be kidding me.

41:46.265 --> 41:49.265
(suspenseful music)

44:04.857 --> 44:06.408
Sam.

44:06.408 --> 44:07.557
You down there?

44:07.557 --> 44:10.557
(suspenseful music)

44:39.847 --> 44:42.180
(screaming)

44:43.275 --> 44:44.108
Stop it.

44:45.346 --> 44:46.625
What do you love in me?

44:46.625 --> 44:49.375
(dramatic music)

44:51.045 --> 44:52.712
Please just go away.

45:38.149 --> 45:41.149
(suspenseful music)

46:01.708 --> 46:03.625
- Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

46:04.768 --> 46:05.601
Shit.

46:11.633 --> 46:12.560
- What are you watching?

46:12.560 --> 46:14.763
- Oh, its nothing.

46:15.598 --> 46:17.293
- I think its something.

46:18.700 --> 46:20.750
- Just the DVD I found in the other room.

46:22.080 --> 46:22.913
- What's on it?

46:23.940 --> 46:26.003
- You know, just boring home movies.

46:28.060 --> 46:30.290
How'd you sleep?

46:30.290 --> 46:32.010
- You're hiding something.

46:32.010 --> 46:32.843
I wanna see.

46:32.843 --> 46:36.380
- Seriously, it's just birthday party.

46:36.380 --> 46:37.830
- I don't care, give me that.

46:40.366 --> 46:43.449
(suspenseful music)

46:52.934 --> 46:53.767
- What is this?

46:53.767 --> 46:56.790
- Its nothing just give me the remote.

46:56.790 --> 46:57.890
- You found this here.

46:58.870 --> 47:00.600
- There's gotta be an explanation, okay?

47:00.600 --> 47:02.210
- An explanation?

47:02.210 --> 47:03.293
That's my house.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.743
- I know, I know, but listen.

47:08.316 --> 47:10.170
- How do they have a video of my house?

47:10.170 --> 47:11.003
- I don't know.

47:12.470 --> 47:13.303
- Fucking Tyler.

47:13.303 --> 47:15.400
He told us to wait here.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.973
These people are in on it.

47:17.987 --> 47:21.340
I fucking told you we couldn't trust him.

47:21.340 --> 47:22.550
- Wait Remy where are you going?

47:22.550 --> 47:24.683
- I'm getting the fuck out of here.

47:25.670 --> 47:26.503
- Wait.

47:27.580 --> 47:29.888
Remy, come on.

47:29.888 --> 47:32.726
Let go of me, you can't
fucking keep me here.

47:32.726 --> 47:34.059
- Wait a minute.

47:36.185 --> 47:37.018
Fuck.

47:38.304 --> 47:39.476
I'm sorry.

47:39.476 --> 47:42.082
- Your fucking hands off of me.

47:42.082 --> 47:44.078
- What are you doing with that?

47:44.078 --> 47:44.957
Put that thing down already.

47:44.957 --> 47:48.590
- Don't you ever fucking touch me again.

47:48.590 --> 47:49.980
- I'm sorry.

47:49.980 --> 47:52.110
Look, I freaked out okay.

47:52.110 --> 47:53.060
If you would've gone out there,

47:53.060 --> 47:54.793
I would not find you again.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.350
Look I didn't mean to hurt you.

48:01.782 --> 48:02.615
Its fine.

48:02.615 --> 48:03.610
Are you okay?

48:03.610 --> 48:04.860
- Of course I'm not okay.

48:07.450 --> 48:08.460
- Can we just go talk this through?

48:08.460 --> 48:10.710
- What they're talking about?

48:10.710 --> 48:12.940
- What we're gonna do next.

48:12.940 --> 48:14.163
- Please, come on.

48:23.680 --> 48:25.290
- We need to go back.

48:25.290 --> 48:28.328
I'll say we're sorry,
that we weren't thinking.

48:28.328 --> 48:30.653
It was because of the drugs.

48:30.653 --> 48:34.330
That we were desperate for
money, they'll understand.

48:34.330 --> 48:35.163
- Remy, we talked about this, okay?

48:35.163 --> 48:36.370
- No, no, no.

48:36.370 --> 48:38.787
(indistinct)

48:39.841 --> 48:41.193
- Would you please sit down?

48:42.420 --> 48:43.253
- We can't get back where we started,

48:43.253 --> 48:45.400
but now without Tyler.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.550
It's just money, right?

48:47.630 --> 48:49.010
- Remy, we've talked about this.

48:49.010 --> 48:50.380
We can't back there.

48:50.380 --> 48:51.613
- Of course we can.

48:55.560 --> 48:59.440
- Remy, I need to tell you something?

49:03.275 --> 49:04.403
- Could you please put that knife down.

49:04.403 --> 49:05.614
- Why?

49:05.614 --> 49:06.614
- I mean it.

49:09.536 --> 49:10.369
- Fine.

49:12.238 --> 49:13.071
What is it?

49:13.071 --> 49:13.990
- I need you to listen to me, okay.

49:13.990 --> 49:16.240
There's nothing for us back there.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.190
- What do you mean?

49:18.118 --> 49:21.443
(indistinct) but in time he'll forgive us.

49:22.420 --> 49:24.490
Well send me to rehab, of course.

49:24.490 --> 49:27.333
And when we're out, everything
will be back to normal.

49:28.550 --> 49:32.675
We'll be clean and happy,
like we used to be again.

49:32.675 --> 49:36.175
- No, no, Remy, that's not an option okay?

49:38.025 --> 49:40.645
- Fine, then I'll go by myself.

49:40.645 --> 49:42.312
- Remy they're dead.

49:44.205 --> 49:45.038
- What?

49:47.444 --> 49:48.694
- They're dead.

49:50.654 --> 49:52.750
- What are you talking about?

49:52.750 --> 49:54.193
- Would you please sit down.

49:57.010 --> 49:58.090
Please, sit.

50:03.210 --> 50:04.810
- What do you mean they're dead.

50:08.930 --> 50:11.813
- Look, there's a problem.

50:15.011 --> 50:17.320
We were all just so fucking
lit, it happened so fast.

50:17.320 --> 50:18.779
You know?

50:18.779 --> 50:21.793
And your mom, she had
a heart attack I think.

50:23.736 --> 50:25.780
You know, at first we
thought she was faking it.

50:25.780 --> 50:28.733
We tried to help her, but it's too late.

50:29.960 --> 50:32.910
And then Tyler, he just started
fucking bugging out and he.

50:36.420 --> 50:37.283
- He what?

50:39.490 --> 50:40.887
What did Tyler do?

50:44.750 --> 50:46.200
- He bashed Brian's skull in.

50:48.757 --> 50:50.307
- I was gonna tell you I swear.

50:53.900 --> 50:56.557
But you've been so on edge
and I just wanted to like

50:56.557 --> 50:57.807
the weirdest...

51:02.056 --> 51:03.656
- What about Billy?

51:03.656 --> 51:05.656
You just left him there?

51:07.597 --> 51:08.430
- No.

51:10.055 --> 51:11.055
- Then what?

51:14.191 --> 51:15.191
- He's gone.

51:17.258 --> 51:19.707
- What do you mean gone?

51:19.707 --> 51:21.033
- We had no choice.

51:22.200 --> 51:23.617
He recognized me.

51:28.858 --> 51:30.191
- You sick fuck.

51:32.330 --> 51:33.830
He was just a kid.

51:34.991 --> 51:36.810
He would've have said shit.

51:36.810 --> 51:38.797
- He would've talked, he saw me.

51:38.797 --> 51:41.170
And right now we'd be on our
way to the fucking gas chamber.

51:41.170 --> 51:42.003
Okay?

51:42.003 --> 51:43.800
- He was my brother.

51:43.800 --> 51:46.305
- Okay, he was like a brother to me too.

51:46.305 --> 51:48.705
You fucking love that kid
so much you know that.

51:53.606 --> 51:55.363
- I can't believe you.

51:55.363 --> 51:57.953
- I did it for us, you've
to understand that.

51:57.953 --> 51:58.870
- Fuck you.

52:01.060 --> 52:02.546
- Remy.

52:02.546 --> 52:05.043
(door knocks)

52:05.043 --> 52:06.340
Finally.

52:06.340 --> 52:08.670
- Listen, just pack your stuff, okay?

52:08.670 --> 52:09.893
Get out of here.

52:29.155 --> 52:29.988
- Remy.

52:34.915 --> 52:35.748
Remy.

52:51.670 --> 52:52.503
Hey.

52:53.573 --> 52:54.550
I was wondering where you ran off to.

52:54.550 --> 52:56.083
- Leave me alone.

52:57.880 --> 52:58.713
- Look,

53:01.550 --> 53:03.370
we've no choice, okay?

53:03.370 --> 53:05.369
We never planned for it
to go down like that.

53:05.369 --> 53:06.643
- We're both murderers.

53:08.070 --> 53:09.620
- You're not the murderer okay?

53:12.130 --> 53:13.580
- We're both murderers.

53:13.580 --> 53:16.187
And we're gonna get the
gas chamber like you said.

53:16.187 --> 53:18.137
- You're not gonna get the gas chamber.

53:19.340 --> 53:22.230
Tyler is gonna be here soon
and then we can disappear

53:22.230 --> 53:23.580
Just like we planned, okay.

53:25.783 --> 53:28.807
And even if by some
miracle we do get caught,

53:29.840 --> 53:32.021
I'll say you have nothing to do with it.

53:32.021 --> 53:33.420
You'll be fine.

53:33.420 --> 53:36.230
- I planned it, I don't
(indistinct) than anyone,

53:36.230 --> 53:38.090
I left the door unlocked, I am guilty.

53:38.090 --> 53:41.221
- You're not guilty,
it was not an accident.

53:41.221 --> 53:42.742
(doorbell rings)

53:42.742 --> 53:44.523
- Fuck, dammit wait here.

53:45.725 --> 53:49.005
(suspenseful music)

53:49.005 --> 53:49.838
- Fuck.

54:18.080 --> 54:18.913
- Is he here?

54:20.100 --> 54:23.563
- No, must just be some kids
playing a prank or something.

54:32.410 --> 54:33.360
What are you doing?

54:34.810 --> 54:35.853
- Getting fucked up.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.067
- Now is not really the time for that.

54:39.067 --> 54:40.467
- What's the fucking matter?

54:47.731 --> 54:50.148
(soft music)

54:53.570 --> 54:54.643
That's your ringtone.

54:57.730 --> 54:59.710
You just said you destroyed it.

54:59.710 --> 55:00.543
- I did.

55:03.980 --> 55:05.520
- You fucking cunt.

55:05.520 --> 55:06.460
- Remy I'm sorry.

55:06.460 --> 55:08.033
- You (indistinct) bitch.

55:09.150 --> 55:11.650
- It wasn't me and I swear it.

55:21.809 --> 55:24.226
(soft music)

55:31.286 --> 55:32.453
What the fuck.

55:34.346 --> 55:36.096
- I felt it in there.

55:37.033 --> 55:41.050
- I smashed this, I swear to priest.

55:41.050 --> 55:42.450
- It doesn't seem destroyed.

55:45.190 --> 55:46.023
- Its from you.

55:49.940 --> 55:52.620
- [Remy's V/O] Hey, I know
you won't ever hear this.

55:52.620 --> 55:54.980
But I didn't know what else to do,

55:54.980 --> 55:56.630
it hurt so much without you here?

55:57.590 --> 56:00.045
I have no one.

56:00.045 --> 56:02.000
I really miss you.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.460
I'm gonna see you soon.

56:03.460 --> 56:04.950
Wherever you are.

56:04.950 --> 56:06.692
I took all these pills,

56:06.692 --> 56:08.033
I'm in the bathtub now.

56:08.930 --> 56:09.890
It feels so warm.

56:11.107 --> 56:11.940
I love you so much.

56:11.940 --> 56:14.026
- When did you fucking leave this?

56:14.026 --> 56:14.859
- Wait what?

56:14.859 --> 56:16.737
- This voicemail about the pills.

56:16.737 --> 56:17.970
- What are you talking about?

56:17.970 --> 56:19.260
- Seriously, when did you leave it?

56:19.260 --> 56:20.450
- I didn't leave anything.

56:20.450 --> 56:22.021
I was with you the entire time.

56:22.021 --> 56:23.550
- Quit fucking around.

56:23.550 --> 56:25.420
I just heard it, you want
me to play it back for you?

56:25.420 --> 56:27.000
- You're scaring me.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.170
- Seriously, when did
you fucking leave it?

56:29.170 --> 56:30.003
- Sam stop.

56:31.515 --> 56:35.051
(doorbell ringing)
(door banging)

56:35.051 --> 56:35.884
- Remy.

56:39.494 --> 56:42.036
(screaming)

56:42.036 --> 56:43.203
- Dammit Remy.

56:45.767 --> 56:48.015
(door banging)

56:48.015 --> 56:51.015
(suspenseful music)

57:08.336 --> 57:10.503
(banging)

57:12.402 --> 57:14.569
(banging)

57:17.922 --> 57:19.839
- [Remy] You loved him?

57:21.199 --> 57:22.032
- What?

57:23.146 --> 57:25.721
- [Remy] You and Tyler ever have sex?

57:25.721 --> 57:27.096
- How could you ask me that?

57:27.096 --> 57:28.346
- Is that a no?

57:30.797 --> 57:31.964
- You serious?

57:35.567 --> 57:38.567
- The way you always talk about him.

57:41.287 --> 57:43.020
- Tyler's like a brother to me, okay?

57:43.020 --> 57:46.653
- Brother who left us both to rot.

57:46.653 --> 57:49.120
That's not fair.

57:49.120 --> 57:49.953
- He'll be here.

57:54.700 --> 57:58.670
- Tyler's dead, he's burning in hell.

57:59.635 --> 58:01.802
(banging)

58:12.710 --> 58:15.010
- Remy, come on, open up.

58:15.010 --> 58:15.930
- Go away.

58:17.732 --> 58:18.565
- Come on,

58:19.550 --> 58:20.383
Remy, there's something weird going on,

58:20.383 --> 58:22.040
we gotta stick together.

58:22.040 --> 58:25.294
- I said leave me alone.

58:25.294 --> 58:27.923
- Come on Remy, open the fucking door.

58:29.490 --> 58:31.110
- Goodbye Sam.

58:31.110 --> 58:31.943
- What?

58:33.353 --> 58:35.073
Remy, open the fucking door.

58:40.823 --> 58:43.823
(suspenseful music)

59:10.200 --> 59:11.033
- Tyler?

59:15.288 --> 59:16.488
What are you doing here?

59:19.941 --> 59:21.897
And why're you still wearing that?

59:25.810 --> 59:27.260
Tyler stop you're scaring me.

59:35.386 --> 59:37.026
Fuck.

59:37.026 --> 59:42.026
Goddammit what do you want?

59:56.654 --> 59:58.237
Remy, Remy wake up.

59:59.307 --> 1:00:00.472
- What's going on?

1:00:00.472 --> 1:00:01.639
Is Tyler here?

1:00:05.020 --> 1:00:07.210
Sam, you're scaring me,

1:00:07.210 --> 1:00:08.157
something happen?

1:00:12.470 --> 1:00:15.003
- Wait, what are you doing in here?

1:00:16.490 --> 1:00:19.223
Sleeping, you told me
to lie down, remember?

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:22.733
You've been sleeping here the whole time?

1:00:23.683 --> 1:00:26.593
What about, who was just downstairs?

1:00:27.830 --> 1:00:29.493
What about my phone?

1:00:29.493 --> 1:00:30.326
- Phone?

1:00:31.450 --> 1:00:32.550
- Yeah in the kitchen.

1:00:33.600 --> 1:00:34.433
- What are you talking about?

1:00:34.433 --> 1:00:35.940
You smashed your phone, remember?

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:38.380
- I did.

1:00:38.380 --> 1:00:39.497
I did, but...

1:00:40.849 --> 1:00:41.682
- But what?

1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:43.573
You okay?

1:00:48.830 --> 1:00:50.340
- I'm just really confused right now.

1:00:50.340 --> 1:00:52.040
I don't know what's going on then.

1:00:53.550 --> 1:00:56.685
- I think you're the one who needs a nap.

1:00:56.685 --> 1:00:57.852
Come lie down.

1:01:00.853 --> 1:01:01.833
Just relax.

1:01:11.780 --> 1:01:14.040
- Remy, Remy, what are you doing?

1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:15.123
- Taking what's mine.

1:01:17.375 --> 1:01:18.350
- What?

1:01:18.350 --> 1:01:19.703
- Your mine now forever.

1:01:21.970 --> 1:01:23.120
- Remy.

1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:23.953
- What's going on?

1:01:23.953 --> 1:01:25.630
- What's the matter?

1:01:25.630 --> 1:01:26.880
Isn't this our honeymoon.

1:01:28.550 --> 1:01:29.503
- What's going on?

1:01:31.130 --> 1:01:33.460
- You told me you were
going to protect me.

1:01:33.460 --> 1:01:36.102
That nothing bad would ever happen to me.

1:01:36.102 --> 1:01:37.740
But you know what?

1:01:37.740 --> 1:01:39.510
Something did,

1:01:39.510 --> 1:01:43.970
something very, very bad, you

1:01:46.590 --> 1:01:48.323
- Remy, what's going on?

1:01:49.210 --> 1:01:50.603
I love you.

1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:53.700
I love you so fucking much.

1:01:53.700 --> 1:01:55.363
- So glad you said that.

1:01:56.230 --> 1:01:58.500
'Cause you're gonna be here with me,

1:01:58.500 --> 1:02:00.299
in this house forever.

1:02:00.299 --> 1:02:02.632
(screaming)

1:02:04.890 --> 1:02:05.723
- Remy!

1:02:07.340 --> 1:02:08.440
- Where are you going?

1:02:10.067 --> 1:02:11.167
Won't you lay with me?

1:02:13.298 --> 1:02:14.597
Just until I fall asleep.

1:02:16.409 --> 1:02:18.742
(screaming)

1:02:19.644 --> 1:02:22.477
(dramatic music)

1:03:06.311 --> 1:03:07.144
- Remy.

1:03:08.141 --> 1:03:08.974
Fuck, no!

1:03:10.770 --> 1:03:11.603
Remy.

1:03:16.681 --> 1:03:20.098
I was just trying to fucking protect you.

1:03:55.351 --> 1:03:56.947
(phone ringing)

1:03:56.947 --> 1:03:57.823
- I'm sorry.

1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:02.153
Hello,

1:04:04.050 --> 1:04:05.350
I'm just around the block.

1:04:07.190 --> 1:04:08.570
Okay.

1:04:08.570 --> 1:04:09.470
I'll be home soon.

1:04:10.890 --> 1:04:11.723
Sorry.

1:04:14.550 --> 1:04:15.383
- Brian.

1:04:16.500 --> 1:04:18.771
We have to get back.

1:04:18.771 --> 1:04:20.720
- Or else what?

1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:22.053
- You know what.

1:04:23.910 --> 1:04:25.510
- Just run away together.

1:04:25.510 --> 1:04:26.343
You and me?

1:04:26.343 --> 1:04:27.593
- You know we can't.

1:04:28.950 --> 1:04:29.783
- Why?

1:04:30.619 --> 1:04:32.923
- Well, for starters we
don't have any money.

1:04:34.590 --> 1:04:36.570
- Can you say that Brian
has a bunch of money.

1:04:36.570 --> 1:04:39.653
Like stacks of cash in
a safe in his office?

1:04:41.070 --> 1:04:42.940
- Do you know the combination.

1:04:42.940 --> 1:04:43.773
- No.

1:04:44.740 --> 1:04:45.640
- Didn't think so.

1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:48.813
- Well, what if we broke it?

1:04:49.790 --> 1:04:52.463
We could like tie him up
and rough him up a bit.

1:04:53.362 --> 1:04:54.670
He could tell us the combo then.

1:04:54.670 --> 1:04:56.603
- They're gonna break us both in two.

1:05:00.060 --> 1:05:01.303
- What if we had help?

1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:04.899
Do you remember Tyler?

1:05:04.899 --> 1:05:05.732
- Yeah.

1:05:06.769 --> 1:05:08.500
- I think he'd help us.

1:05:08.500 --> 1:05:09.653
- Tyler would do that?

1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:14.080
- Yeah, I mean, we'd have to
probably talk him in a bit but,

1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:14.913
he'd be down.

1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:17.480
- Its too risky.

1:05:17.480 --> 1:05:19.343
Ryan would recognize me for sure.

1:05:20.510 --> 1:05:22.650
- Who says you even have to be there?

1:05:22.650 --> 1:05:24.143
Pretty sure we can handle it.

1:05:24.143 --> 1:05:25.793
- He'll know it was me.

1:05:29.114 --> 1:05:30.114
- Who cares.

1:05:31.277 --> 1:05:35.167
By the time he figured anything
out we'd be gone, long gone.

1:05:36.907 --> 1:05:38.520
And Tyler knows a guy that could help us

1:05:38.520 --> 1:05:39.573
get new identities.

1:05:40.906 --> 1:05:43.460
- We could just, disappear out of here,

1:05:43.460 --> 1:05:44.297
you and me.

1:05:46.875 --> 1:05:47.708
- Just us?

1:05:49.030 --> 1:05:49.863
- Just us.

1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:52.988
- Please?

1:05:52.988 --> 1:05:55.113
(crying)

1:05:55.113 --> 1:05:56.500
- I love the sound of that.

1:06:17.150 --> 1:06:17.983
- [Remy] Sam?

1:06:19.540 --> 1:06:20.373
Sam.

1:06:21.289 --> 1:06:22.139
Are you in there?

1:06:25.930 --> 1:06:29.013
(suspenseful music)

1:06:32.538 --> 1:06:34.462
- Hey, what's up?

1:06:34.462 --> 1:06:36.295
- Do I look different?

1:06:37.609 --> 1:06:39.720
- Different how, what do you mean?

1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:41.273
- People see me.

1:06:41.273 --> 1:06:44.292
- First of all, you didn't do anything.

1:06:44.292 --> 1:06:46.340
Okay. Both came up with
that line together.

1:06:46.340 --> 1:06:47.937
You weren't even there.

1:06:47.937 --> 1:06:49.937
- But it was my idea.

1:06:49.937 --> 1:06:51.840
I came up with the plan.

1:06:51.840 --> 1:06:55.840
- Look, we both came up
with that plan together.

1:06:56.842 --> 1:06:58.425
- Wish I never did.

1:07:20.510 --> 1:07:22.580
- You let them do this to me.

1:07:22.580 --> 1:07:23.970
You let them do this to me.

1:07:23.970 --> 1:07:26.259
You let them do this to me.

1:07:26.259 --> 1:07:28.378
You let them do this to me.

1:07:28.378 --> 1:07:30.711
(screaming)

1:07:49.550 --> 1:07:50.383
- [Remy] Hello?

1:07:51.260 --> 1:07:52.093
Sam.

1:07:53.978 --> 1:07:54.811
- Remy?

1:07:56.220 --> 1:07:57.500
Remy.

1:07:57.500 --> 1:07:58.513
Go hide.

1:08:00.020 --> 1:08:00.853
- [Remy] Sam?

1:08:02.846 --> 1:08:04.263
Are you in there.

1:08:05.947 --> 1:08:06.780
- Remy,

1:08:09.554 --> 1:08:11.554
fuck, fuck, fuck oh God.

1:08:46.932 --> 1:08:49.515
(upbeat music)

1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:27.650
- We know what you did.

1:09:27.650 --> 1:09:30.504
You can never leave this place.

1:09:30.504 --> 1:09:32.213
You're going to die here.

1:09:38.441 --> 1:09:40.459
- Oh goddammit.

1:09:40.459 --> 1:09:41.959
Oh, what the fuck.

1:09:56.544 --> 1:09:57.377
Fuck.

1:10:02.553 --> 1:10:03.470
Let me out.

1:10:07.141 --> 1:10:08.058
Let me out.

1:10:10.292 --> 1:10:13.042
(dramatic music)

1:10:14.441 --> 1:10:15.274
Oh God.

1:10:26.727 --> 1:10:29.060
- Why did you do this to me?

1:10:30.039 --> 1:10:31.687
- Remy, what are you talking about?

1:10:31.687 --> 1:10:32.810
- It's all your fault.

1:10:32.810 --> 1:10:34.030
- Remy, listen,

1:10:34.030 --> 1:10:34.945
I don't know what's going on right now,

1:10:34.945 --> 1:10:35.896
but we gotta get out of here.

1:10:35.896 --> 1:10:37.313
It's pretty nice.

1:10:38.585 --> 1:10:40.215
Remy what's going on?

1:10:40.215 --> 1:10:41.048
Remy!

1:10:47.532 --> 1:10:48.365
Remy!

1:10:58.119 --> 1:10:58.952
Remy!

1:11:14.189 --> 1:11:15.022
Remy!

1:11:57.842 --> 1:12:00.342
(soft music)

1:12:38.623 --> 1:12:40.223
- It's pretty nice.

1:12:40.223 --> 1:12:41.056
- Yeah,

1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:45.370
See, I told you Tyler would come through.

1:12:51.930 --> 1:12:52.922
Hey,

1:12:52.922 --> 1:12:55.072
why don't you come sit
down and relax a bit

1:12:59.152 --> 1:13:01.958
and I'm gonna go check out
the (indistinct) situation.

1:13:01.958 --> 1:13:02.791
- Okay.

1:13:53.526 --> 1:13:56.526
(suspenseful music)

1:14:26.716 --> 1:14:29.383
(upbeat music)
