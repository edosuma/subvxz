WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:01.234
.

00:06.607 --> 00:07.275
- You snuck out
this morning.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.277
- Oh, yeah.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.545
I-I went to the gym
kind of early.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.347
Needed to clear my head.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.149
- Anything you want
to talk about?

00:16.283 --> 00:19.087
- No.
It's nothing important.

00:19.120 --> 00:19.987
- Okay.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.489
- Thought they were
rousting vagrants

00:21.522 --> 00:23.124
when this one
stumbled in.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.192
Hey, Erin.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.595
- What's up,
Dr. Halstead?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.263
- Oh, you know, just staying
out of trouble.

00:29.297 --> 00:33.067
- Uh-huh.

00:33.101 --> 00:36.137
- So...
[clears throat]

00:36.170 --> 00:38.038
Abby tracked me down.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.608
- Yeah, I--

00:40.641 --> 00:43.144
I probably should've warned you.
She called me a few times too.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.612
- All right, so you knew
she was in Chicago.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.150
- She's here?
- Yes, she's here.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.151
She's looking for you.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.586
- Hey, gotta go.
- Does--

00:52.620 --> 00:55.223
Erin know
about the two of you?

00:55.256 --> 00:58.292
- Um, no, nothing.
I gotta go.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.627
- All right.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.829
- These woods are
in CPD jurisdiction,

01:01.862 --> 01:03.664
but the local boys are
pretty jacked up

01:03.697 --> 01:05.433
over this whole thing.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.534
You want me
to send 'em home?

01:06.567 --> 01:09.303
- Eh, might need 'em.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.638
- This is
Sergeant Hank Voight.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.540
Why don't you tell him
what you told us?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.208
- I was hiking Northeast.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.577
It's the fifth anniversary
of my dad's death.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.379
We used to do the trail
together.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.314
- Where was it
that you saw this girl?

01:20.348 --> 01:23.884
- Not sure.
I lost my bearings Wednesday,

01:23.917 --> 01:27.255
saw her Thursday.
It's Friday, right?

01:27.288 --> 01:28.356
I tried to help her.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.424
I went after her,
but I tripped.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.526
- Do you have any other details
about the girl?

01:32.560 --> 01:36.897
- She was white, about my age,
barefoot.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.668
She was bleeding,
running from something.

01:40.701 --> 01:44.338
It was about 5 miles in
when I saw her.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.906
- Thanks.
Go ahead, Caesar.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.176
- Let's go.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.413
- All right, so there's a girl
lost in the woods,

01:52.446 --> 01:54.382
she's barefoot,
and it's this cold out?

01:54.415 --> 01:56.150
Sounds like the guy's
hallucinating.

01:56.184 --> 01:59.220
- There's one way to find out.
Suit up.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.120
Get everyone together

02:00.154 --> 02:03.591
from every different
jurisdiction in five.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.727
Won't be any footprints,
but maybe we get lucky.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.729
[helicopter blades whirring]

02:08.762 --> 02:11.131
[rescue dogs barking]

02:16.504 --> 02:19.673
[metallic clanging]

02:23.711 --> 02:26.614
- Hank, we're a couple hundred
yards north of you,

02:26.647 --> 02:29.717
approaching a cabin.
We may have something.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.152
- Copy that.
Be right there.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:44.698 --> 02:47.468
- Clear.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.408
We heard something,
but the cabin's empty.

02:54.442 --> 02:58.679
- Huh.
Check that container.

02:58.712 --> 02:59.947
- That lock's new.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.283
That's weird, right?

03:10.591 --> 03:12.660
- [whimpering]

03:12.693 --> 03:14.428
- Hey, we're the police.
- Don't come in!

03:14.462 --> 03:16.497
There's a bomb!
It's a trap.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.299
He rigged it.
Please!

03:18.332 --> 03:21.335
Please, we're all gonna die!
[sobbing]

03:22.336 --> 03:23.304
- Guys?

03:23.337 --> 03:24.472
- Check it out.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:29.677 --> 03:30.644
- Yeah, it's clear.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.679
- I got nothing.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.582
- All the walls in here
are intact.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.350
Hank, what am I doing here?

03:36.384 --> 03:37.385
- It's your call.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.721
- [whimpering]

03:40.754 --> 03:41.789
- Fall back.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.592
- Erin!
- I'm already in here.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.626
Just fall back.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.361
- Jay.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.663
- [sobbing]
I can't leave, just go.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.732
- We need to get you
out of here.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.801
- [sobbing]
Just go.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.370
No, please, you can't
cross that line!

03:56.404 --> 03:58.439
I can't leave.
Just go.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.276
- It's okay.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.478
- [sobs]

04:04.512 --> 04:07.014
- It's all right.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.582
It's all right.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.818
- [sobbing]

04:10.851 --> 04:12.620
- Come on, you're okay.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.689
Let me look at these, okay?
Can I see this?

04:17.825 --> 04:18.858
- [sobs]

04:20.861 --> 04:23.331
I don't understand.

04:23.364 --> 04:26.700
He said that...
He--

04:26.734 --> 04:30.371
he would--he said
I couldn't take 'em off.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.640
[sobbing] He said I couldn't--
- It's okay, it's okay.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.309
- [sobbing]

04:35.343 --> 04:36.744
- Come on, we're gonna
get you out of here.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.078
- I can't leave.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.580
If I leave,
then he's gonna kill me.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.482
- No, that's not
gonna happen.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.683
- Why aren't you
listening to me?

04:42.716 --> 04:44.452
- It's okay, it's okay.
You're safe,

04:44.485 --> 04:47.287
you're safe, you're safe.
It's okay.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.898
Now, we can't
force you to do it,

04:57.931 --> 05:00.501
but it might help us catch
whoever did this.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.902
- He didn't touch me.

05:02.903 --> 05:06.039
- Thank God, but...
just in case--

05:06.073 --> 05:08.542
- I'm not stupid.
He didn't touch me.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.613
- Okay.
What did he want?

05:12.646 --> 05:15.916
- For me to stay
in the trailer.

05:15.949 --> 05:19.687
- Juliana, let me ask you,
can you picture the man?

05:28.996 --> 05:31.632
- Had you ever seen him
before?

05:31.665 --> 05:33.701
- No.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.736
He put an ad
up on Craigslist,

05:35.769 --> 05:37.971
a caretaker
for his cabin.

05:38.005 --> 05:42.676
I drove up there to meet him,
and he locked me up.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.845
I escaped.
[chuckles]

05:44.878 --> 05:46.680
- Okay, so you got out,

05:46.714 --> 05:48.115
and that hiker found you,
but you didn't want his help.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.950
Why not?

05:49.983 --> 05:51.752
- He said he was gonna
find the police,

05:51.785 --> 05:53.120
and Austin said
no police.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.929
- What about your car, the one
that you drove up there in?

06:01.962 --> 06:04.665
- He must've taken it.
My phone too.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.801
He's gonna come back.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.971
He always comes at noon,
and he said if I'm not there

06:11.004 --> 06:13.040
he's gonna find
my little sister.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.008
I have to go back there.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.613
- All right.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.621
- We need to get her working
on a composite sketch.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.789
Is she ready?

06:28.822 --> 06:32.993
- Uh, she is lucid,
her CT is clear.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.928
She is doing her best
to offer

06:34.962 --> 06:36.630
whatever details
she can remember

06:36.664 --> 06:38.131
without reliving
the trauma.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.767
I don't think
we should push her.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.035
- So she kept it together
well enough to lie to us.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.070
- That's not
what she's saying.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.739
- N-no, it's not.

06:45.773 --> 06:46.574
But given Juliana's state,

06:46.607 --> 06:49.142
it's possible
she could be lying.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.745
- It doesn't matter.
We gotta try to ID the guy.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.180
We have her clothes.
Let's swab 'em for DNA,

06:53.213 --> 06:55.983
see if Austin is
in the system.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.117
Can you run
a pregnancy test?

06:57.150 --> 06:59.019
She doesn't need to consent
for that.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.821
- What do you think
is going on with her?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.690
Is she protecting someone?

07:02.723 --> 07:05.659
- That is where we exit
my area of expertise.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.827
- You really don't trust her,
do you?

07:06.860 --> 07:10.898
- No.
This is a crazy tall tale.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.066
Let's just start with the test
and go from there.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.135
- All right.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.110
- Look who's here.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.113
- Hey, Al...

07:26.146 --> 07:27.180
Man, you don't
have to be here.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.716
Take time,

07:28.749 --> 07:30.183
mourn your daughter.
We got your back.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.186
- Oh. Honestly, if I don't
find something to do,

07:33.220 --> 07:35.956
I'm gonna wind up in a ditch.
[chuckles]

07:37.691 --> 07:40.027
- All right. Come on up.
We caught a weird one.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.028
- All right.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.930
- Hey, Alvin?
- Yeah?

07:42.963 --> 07:47.200
- If you ever want to not talk
about it, I'm your gal, okay?

07:47.234 --> 07:49.136
- Okay.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.704
Okay, okay.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.208
- Our kidnapping victim's been
ID'd as Juliana Parks.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.978
She's 20 years old.
No priors,

07:58.011 --> 07:59.947
grew up in Indiana
where her parents still live.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.281
- And they never
reported her missing?

08:01.314 --> 08:02.950
- No, they did,
in Indiana,

08:02.983 --> 08:03.951
and there's a lot
of money there.

08:03.984 --> 08:04.952
Her dad runs a law firm,

08:04.985 --> 08:07.187
but they were never
contacted for a ransom.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.222
- Juliana says
her head and her palms

08:09.256 --> 08:10.290
were injured from falling.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.760
- Running back to the cage
where she was locked up?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.027
- That's her story.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.730
She escaped, ran into the hiker,
then went back to her enclosure.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.932
- All right, any details
on the cabin?

08:18.966 --> 08:21.902
- Very, very little. It's owned
by an LLC based in Wyoming,

08:21.935 --> 08:24.037
but we cannot figure out
who's behind it.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.106
- All right,
so find out who sold it.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.176
We gotta start putting names
to this thing.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.211
Who was Juliana Parks
in contact with

08:31.244 --> 08:33.013
before she disappeared?

08:33.046 --> 08:35.749
Who knows her in Indiana?
Who knows her in Chicago?

08:35.783 --> 08:38.852
And get historical locations
on her car from NVLS.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.253
- On it, boss.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.756
- Ooh.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.997
- Um, I'll meet you inside.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.331
- What are you,
signing autographs?

08:51.364 --> 08:53.767
- I'll explain later.
I'll meet you inside.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.039
Abby, what are you
doing here?

08:59.072 --> 09:01.008
- Just waiting for you.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.577
- Uh...
well, it's negative 5 out.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.945
You want to talk inside?

09:04.978 --> 09:07.180
- Yeah.
- All right.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.889
- Gonna lock me up?

09:15.923 --> 09:17.925
- Do I need to?
- [laughs]

09:17.958 --> 09:19.827
I'm good.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.328
- So what's up?

09:21.361 --> 09:24.264
- I'm getting married
in July.

09:24.297 --> 09:28.035
He's a lawyer, a partner
at a firm in Philly.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.002
- That's great.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.871
- Well, the reason why
I had to see you is

09:30.904 --> 09:33.807
I need you to sign
our divorce papers.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.009
- Wh--am I hallucinating
right now?

09:36.043 --> 09:38.045
I thought I signed 'em,
like, eight years ago.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.248
- Well, I-I didn't
countersign them exactly.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.383
We're still married.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.053
- Wow.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.857
- Oh, don't be so dramatic.

09:49.890 --> 09:54.061
Just--just sign the thing
and I'm gone.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.195
- Um, sure, yeah.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.064
Where am I signing?
Let's do it.

09:57.097 --> 10:01.068
- Well, I-I don't walk around
with divorce papers.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.235
How about a drink?

10:04.404 --> 10:07.641
I'm in town for two days.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.945
- Um...yeah, sure.
All right.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.080
- Yeah?
- Let's get a drink.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.147
- Cool.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.350
- [sighs]

10:19.119 --> 10:21.955
- Okay. Until four years ago,
that cabin was owned

10:21.989 --> 10:25.192
by Darren and Geraldine Crane.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.961
They're both local.
She's a retired school teacher,

10:27.995 --> 10:29.062
full pension.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.131
- Husband?

10:32.365 --> 10:35.302
- Deceased as of last year.
Over the Road trucker.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.371
- All right.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.974
Ruzek, let's go.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.009
Let's see if she can
enlighten us

10:42.042 --> 10:44.678
on this, uh, mystery buyer.

10:44.712 --> 10:47.981
- Al, come on, did I do
something wrong, or...

10:48.015 --> 10:51.018
- No, you're eating.
Um, it's cold out.

10:52.019 --> 10:52.986
- I'm eating too.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.321
- But I don't care about that.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.389
- [laughs]
Zip up.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.460
- Please.
- Thank you.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.897
- Now, that's terrible.
Tied up?

11:03.931 --> 11:06.466
- She wasn't tied up.
She was chained to the wall.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.070
- [sighs] Well, the cabin
was Darren's place,

11:10.103 --> 11:11.972
before they called it
a man cave.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.140
- Huh.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.942
- He'd disappear out there
for days.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.009
- Hunting?

11:16.043 --> 11:19.446
- That's what he said,
but I never got my fur coat.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.248
- But you sold the cabin,
right?

11:21.281 --> 11:24.417
- Darren's decision.
He used to drive a truck.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.286
He got laid off.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.155
- He was in an accident,
right?

11:28.188 --> 11:31.458
- Which was not his fault,
but they let him go.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.931
I think that's what killed him,
losing his purpose.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.299
- Ma'am, the buyer
of the cabin,

11:39.332 --> 11:42.135
they shielded their identity
behind an LLC.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.038
- I-I don't know
what that means.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.307
- It just means that
they didn't want to be known.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.043
Were you by chance
at the closing?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.044
Did you meet the buyer?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.746
- No.

11:52.780 --> 11:56.183
Darren kept everything;
you can look in his office.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.218
- Please.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.354
- Can't barely bring myself
to set foot in there.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.196
I'll leave you to it.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.231
- Thanks very much.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.435
- Crack a window.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.505
- Dog found it,
started going nuts.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.515
- [sighs] This whole area's
a crime scene.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.551
Anybody who doesn't need
to be here should step off.

12:41.094 --> 12:41.895
- This body's still
getting worked on.

12:42.896 --> 12:43.931
This is a male victim.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.534
Tech thinks he was young,
maybe 25 at the most,

12:47.567 --> 12:49.502
based on the development
of the skull.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.404
Been buried here
for a year.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.407
- Juliana did say to Dr. Reese
that Austin was bragging,

12:54.441 --> 12:56.409
that this wasn't
his first time.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.811
- So she was telling
the truth.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.984
Bad vibe out here.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.386
- Yeah. I'll race you
back to the city.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.520
- Okay.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.290
- This is weird, right?

13:10.323 --> 13:11.992
I mean, you're selling
your house.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.427
Wouldn't you want to know
who was buying it?

13:14.461 --> 13:17.497
- Well, we're not
most people, so...

13:23.603 --> 13:26.606
- You know, Al, I don't...
really know what to say

13:26.639 --> 13:28.876
about Lexi.

13:36.383 --> 13:37.951
Can I give you a hug?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.622
- Hey.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.892
Hey, man.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.128
Thanks.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.369
- [clears throat]

13:57.537 --> 13:58.939
Oh.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.040
Here you go.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.946
- Austin Forchette.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.481
Paid to have the cabin inspected
before the sale.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.517
Okay.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.658
- Your girl said they were
feeding her?

14:18.691 --> 14:19.960
- Yeah, that's
what she said.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.528
Breakfast, lunch,
sensible dinner.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.562
- You say so,

14:22.595 --> 14:25.132
because these poor specimens
were starved to death.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.900
No sign of external injuries,

14:26.934 --> 14:29.903
just decreased
bone mineral density.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.104
- Mm, and the other body,

14:31.138 --> 14:32.605
how long ago you think
she was buried?

14:32.639 --> 14:35.175
- Three to four years ago.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.544
- Hmm. And what's that
right there, a break?

14:37.577 --> 14:39.947
- Multiple compression fractures
indicate

14:39.980 --> 14:41.548
the severity
of the bone loss.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.551
And they didn't heal,
so we can see the extent.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.653
- And they didn't heal
because he was starved.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.888
- Most likely cause
of death.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.359
- Huh.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.161
- We have a BOLO out
on Austin Forchette,

14:54.194 --> 14:57.064
24 years old.
Kid's barely a citizen.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.232
This is him his last year
in the foster care system.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.568
He's got no driver's license,
dropped out of high school--

15:01.601 --> 15:04.504
no cell phone, no bank account,
no political party,

15:04.537 --> 15:06.706
no known address.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.408
Yeah, in summary,
we can't find him.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.443
- So you're telling me
that a kid with no job,

15:10.477 --> 15:14.147
no education forms
an out-of-state corporation

15:14.181 --> 15:16.549
just so he can buy himself
a little cabin in the woods?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.119
- We're still waiting on a judge
to tell us who owns that LLC,

15:19.152 --> 15:21.221
but this guy,
he makes sense

15:21.254 --> 15:23.690
as far as snatching up
Juliana Parks is concerned.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.592
- I don't know,
because whoever snatched her up

15:25.625 --> 15:26.526
took care of her.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.561
That doesn't match
the victims that we got

15:28.595 --> 15:30.030
over here that died
of starvation.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.564
- I want to take another run
at this girl.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.500
Maybe she's protecting him
for some reason.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.602
- Um, you guys, you're not
gonna believe this.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.671
The Media Department
just forwarded it.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.110
- My name is Daniel Jung.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.046
I'm a U.S. Military-trained
hostage recovery specialist,

15:46.079 --> 15:47.514
and I've been hired
by a third party

15:47.547 --> 15:49.716
who offers $50,000

15:49.749 --> 15:52.219
for the return
of Shanee Wallis.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.487
Now, she was taken
with her friend Juliana Parks

15:54.521 --> 15:56.656
in the Chicagoland area
five days ago.

15:56.689 --> 16:00.760
Juliana has been recovered,
but Shanee is still being held.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.262
I am not law enforcement.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.064
I do not represent
law enforcement.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.067
I only want Shanee Wallis
returned to her family.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.103
You can contact me
at danieljungrecovery.com.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.172
- I want this one.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.109
- Who's Shanee Wallis?

16:18.345 --> 16:21.114
- Hey, Daniel Jung.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.216
So, you want to do
what I do?

16:23.250 --> 16:24.217
- Who are you?

16:24.251 --> 16:25.418
- I'm Detective Alvin Olinsky.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.755
This is Sergeant Hank Voight,
Chicago Police Department.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.490
So, what are you doing

16:30.523 --> 16:31.758
in the middle
of our investigation?

16:31.791 --> 16:34.527
- [chuckles]
Well, hold on, boys, okay?

16:34.561 --> 16:37.064
Look, I-I'm just trying to
locate Shanee Wallis,

16:37.097 --> 16:39.299
same as you. You know,
we should compare notes.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.101
- The first time we ever
heard that name

16:41.134 --> 16:43.170
was when you went public.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.239
- So who's paying you,
and what do they want?

16:46.273 --> 16:48.108
- [chuckles]
I have the right to conceal

16:48.141 --> 16:50.143
the identity of my client.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.679
- Sit down.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.082
- What's your angle here?

16:55.115 --> 16:57.617
Have you ever actually
recovered a hostage?

16:57.650 --> 17:00.720
- Look, I'm just trying
to help.

17:00.753 --> 17:05.657
- We found a little girl
chained up like a dog.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.528
So if you know what's going on,
this is your last chance

17:08.560 --> 17:11.198
to do right, or you're gonna be
charged with obstruction.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.803
- Okay, look,
a guy called me, all right?

17:16.836 --> 17:18.805
He had a voice modulator,
gave me five K up front.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.773
I get another ten
when I get Shanee Wallis back.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.343
Okay, the money's real.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.645
It hit my account
this morning.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.781
Y-you can trace the deposit.
You can trace the call.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.618
- Shanee Wallis wasn't
reported missing.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.720
Her friend
didn't mention anything.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.157
- Well, then someone's lying.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.126
But it's not me.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.699
- No, it's none of these.
He's older, he's bald.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.868
I'm sorry, I should have
said that earlier.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.171
[sighs]

17:51.204 --> 17:53.673
- Why did he separate
you and Shanee?

17:56.676 --> 17:58.411
- Why don't you want us
to find him?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.680
- [sighs]

18:00.713 --> 18:03.750
- I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.888
- Your friend,
Shanee Wallis,

18:08.921 --> 18:11.791
he took her,
and she's in danger, right?

18:13.426 --> 18:15.195
- [sobs]

18:15.228 --> 18:18.398
He said if I go to the police
he's gonna kill her!

18:18.431 --> 18:20.367
That's why I went
back to the cabin.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.235
He's gonna kill her!

18:22.269 --> 18:25.205
You gotta take me back!

18:25.238 --> 18:27.374
- You've given us
the bare minimum for days...

18:27.407 --> 18:28.875
- [sobs]
- And you are lying to me

18:28.908 --> 18:30.843
right now.
Is he on this sheet?

18:30.877 --> 18:32.345
- [sobbing]

18:32.379 --> 18:34.281
- Which one is Austin?

18:35.915 --> 18:37.116
- Him.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.154
- If your friend's dead now,
that's on you.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.626
- [sobbing]

18:46.659 --> 18:48.395
- Hey, Juliana?
Hey.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.629
- [sobs]

18:49.662 --> 18:50.730
- Any detail will help.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.166
Nothing is too small.
We just gotta find your friend.

18:54.501 --> 18:59.372
- He drives a green Jeep,
Indiana license plates.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.174
He said it belongs
to his brother.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.475
- Okay.

19:02.509 --> 19:06.213
- Please find her.
She's so scared.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.883
- Sarge, our victim saw
Austin Forchette

19:10.917 --> 19:13.320
driving his brother's car.
It's a green Jeep.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.153
- The odd detail there

19:14.187 --> 19:15.288
being Forchette doesn't have
a brother.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.790
- Right, but he did spend
five years in foster care

19:17.824 --> 19:19.959
with this guy,
Marcus Walker,

19:19.992 --> 19:22.429
and he drives
a '91 Green Jeep Cherokee.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.963
- He lives right here
on South Calumet.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.898
- All right, move fast.
I want him off that block

19:25.932 --> 19:27.467
before anybody knows
he's missing.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.501
- All right.
- All right,

19:28.535 --> 19:30.270
have Lindsay and Halstead
meet him over there.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.439
- Yeah.
- Copy that.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.310
- Green Cherokee.

19:39.446 --> 19:42.849
- Maybe she finally came around.
Let's hope it's not too late.

19:44.784 --> 19:45.985
- Are they cool?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.520
- I don't know, ask her.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.489
- No, sir.
You ask her.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.723
- No thanks.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.363
- Marcus Walker!

19:56.396 --> 19:58.365
- Hey, hey, hey.
Where you going?

19:58.398 --> 19:59.832
- What is this?

19:59.866 --> 20:00.933
You're here for Austin.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.469
- Where is he?
- He went out the back.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.471
I'm trying to get to my car.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.073
- 5021 George,

20:07.106 --> 20:08.875
advise responding units
that the wanted offender...

20:08.908 --> 20:09.776
- All right,
hold him down.

20:09.809 --> 20:10.677
- All right,
put your hands on the roof.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.012
- We are pursuing
in covert vehicles.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.382
- Copy that, 5021 George.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.362
What are you doing?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.275
Erin!

21:13.940 --> 21:15.342
Moving!

21:20.813 --> 21:22.549
I got movement!
He's still alive.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.884
Austin Forchette!
Turn the car off,

21:24.917 --> 21:26.619
put your hands
outside the vehicle!

21:26.653 --> 21:27.987
Do it nice and slow!

21:28.020 --> 21:29.055
- Gun!
- No!

21:32.058 --> 21:33.593
- Lincoln,
5021 emergency.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.396
Roll an ambulance
to 100th and Avenue N--

21:36.429 --> 21:37.397
N as in Nora.
We have an offender

21:37.430 --> 21:39.031
with a self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head.

21:39.065 --> 21:42.335
- Hey. Hey, hey,
ambo's on the way, stay with me.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.003
Stay with me.
Stay with me!

21:45.104 --> 21:47.306
Hey!

21:54.581 --> 21:57.384
- I think this is
Juliana Parks's car.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.851
- This could be
her friend's sweater.

22:12.665 --> 22:12.865
- Hey.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.470
Marcus.

22:18.605 --> 22:20.407
Hmm.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.474
You up to speed?

22:21.508 --> 22:22.775
- You mean
on Austin's death?

22:22.809 --> 22:25.144
- He tried to kill
two police officers,

22:25.177 --> 22:27.814
then he did what he did
to himself.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.284
Look, we need to account

22:32.318 --> 22:33.920
for your brother's whereabouts
last week.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.989
- As I told Detective Olinsky,

22:37.023 --> 22:38.491
I don't know
what he did all day.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.160
- A little compassion.
Girl's missing.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.795
- You think I know
where she is?

22:44.497 --> 22:46.766
Austin was messed up.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.736
November, he shows up
looking for a place to crash.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.605
We weren't really brothers.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.006
He just didn't have
anybody else.

22:55.675 --> 22:58.511
- Friends?
Girlfriend?

22:58.545 --> 22:59.979
- Girlfriend?

23:00.012 --> 23:01.748
You don't get it.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.550
He was touched.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.552
Yeah, the guy
hardly slept.

23:05.585 --> 23:06.919
Just played video games
on this thing.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.689
- He lured girls in
on Craigslist, right?

23:11.558 --> 23:12.792
Could he have used that?

23:12.825 --> 23:14.894
- No.
Austin didn't read or write.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.437
- So he must've had help.

23:24.471 --> 23:27.940
- Hey, I just gave him
a place to sleep, all right?

23:27.974 --> 23:29.576
That's it.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.812
- Mm-hmm.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.947
- Look, I'm telling you,
somebody tricked him.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.216
- Tricked him?

23:37.249 --> 23:39.486
- It wasn't me.
- Mm-hmm.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.722
- It wasn't me!

23:45.024 --> 23:48.227
- Bad news.
He tried to wipe this thing.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.562
- Who, the partner?

23:49.596 --> 23:50.830
We need that digital
search warrant.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.231
- No, we were actually able
to recover

23:52.264 --> 23:53.500
a couple gigs of data.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.634
They couldn't write
over everything.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.870
- Yeah, it's--we got their
whole Craigslist history.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.039
Mostly people responding
to the caretaker ad,

24:00.072 --> 24:01.941
Austin screens them.
It's pretty mild stuff

24:01.974 --> 24:03.610
except for this one guy.

24:03.643 --> 24:04.811
Anthony Ochoa.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.847
75 angry emails
back and forth.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.249
This is five years ago.
He's a local cat.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.684
- Bring him in.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.686
- That's the thing.
He won't come in.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.727
Anthony Ochoa?

24:20.760 --> 24:22.995
I'm Officer Ruzek.
This is Officer Atwater.

24:23.029 --> 24:26.265
- Can I see your credentials,
please? Badge and ID.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.501
- [scoffs] What, you want
my driver's license?

24:28.535 --> 24:30.637
- I need to make sure
you're not part of the game.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.674
- Okay.
Hold onto that.

24:41.648 --> 24:44.050
- These people.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.854
I didn't believe it was them
until I saw this.

24:47.887 --> 24:51.023
- I only want Shanee Wallis
returned to her family.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.959
- Exactly the kind of thing
Austin does.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.594
- What are you saying,
Austin hired someone

24:54.627 --> 24:55.728
to look into his own crimes?

24:55.762 --> 24:58.631
- [chuckles]
It's all games.

24:58.665 --> 25:01.868
When I met him,
I was on leave from law school.

25:01.901 --> 25:05.037
I drive out and interview
for the caretaker gig.

25:05.071 --> 25:07.540
I meet Austin
and an older man.

25:07.574 --> 25:08.841
- Older man? Did you get
the older man's name?

25:08.875 --> 25:11.711
- No, but I got a bad vibe.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.646
An evil vibe.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.847
Said I left my inhaler
in the car,

25:14.881 --> 25:17.917
got out, and drove away,
fast.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.119
- Okay, tell me
there's more,

25:20.152 --> 25:22.555
because you could've
told us that on the phone.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.956
- That was the beginning.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.893
When I posted online,
"Stay away from this scam,"

25:26.926 --> 25:28.327
they went to war.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.996
They hacked my bank account,

25:30.029 --> 25:32.632
sent private photos
of me and my boyfriend

25:32.665 --> 25:35.034
to my parents,
to my professors.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.670
They were good at this.
They ruined my life.

25:37.704 --> 25:38.638
- Okay, real sorry to hear
all of that,

25:38.671 --> 25:40.807
but did you ever get
the other guy's name?

25:40.840 --> 25:43.810
- The Mastermind?
No. I gave up.

25:43.843 --> 25:46.045
- Do you think you could
remember his face?

25:47.113 --> 25:49.716
- Would you remember the devil
if you met him?

25:51.217 --> 25:52.819
- Something's been
bugging me.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.754
This thing had to come
from somewhere.

25:54.787 --> 25:55.922
- Well, that's safe to say.

25:55.955 --> 25:56.989
- Right,
so I looked into it--

25:57.023 --> 25:59.058
- Hey, boss?
Sorry to interrupt.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.794
The witness who actually saw
suspect number two,

26:01.828 --> 26:03.696
he's willing to help.
He's still a little freaked out,

26:03.730 --> 26:05.698
but we're gonna have
a sketch soon.

26:05.732 --> 26:06.799
- All right.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.100
- All right, I got somewhere
on the shipping container.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.036
NICB sent over their file.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.171
The shipping company
reported this thing stolen

26:12.204 --> 26:13.339
five years ago.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.775
- Five years ago Forchette
would've been kind of young

26:15.808 --> 26:17.176
to steal a box off a truck.

26:17.209 --> 26:20.112
- Right, but we know that
he had help from someone.

26:20.146 --> 26:23.716
We also know that he purchased
the cabin from Darren Crane.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.652
- Mm-hmm.
- This is where it gets weird.

26:25.685 --> 26:28.087
Darren Crane was
driving the truck

26:28.120 --> 26:30.189
when this container
was stolen.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.191
- All right,
so talk to Crane's widow.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.093
Could be she knows
who was helping the kid.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.863
- Or could be the husband was
a co-conspirator, Sarge.

26:36.896 --> 26:37.797
- No, but he died
a year ago.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.399
Those girls were abducted
two weeks ago.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.034
Look, we're missing
something.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.203
Go talk to that widow.

26:44.236 --> 26:46.105
- Let's go.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.948
- Chicago PD!

26:55.982 --> 26:58.017
- Stop!
Please, you're hurting me!

26:59.051 --> 27:01.053
- You hear that?
- Check the door.

27:03.790 --> 27:06.726
- Chicago PD!

27:06.759 --> 27:10.129
Mrs. Crane?

27:10.162 --> 27:12.799
- Is someone there?

27:18.270 --> 27:21.674
Is someone there?
Help me!

27:25.144 --> 27:26.178
- Shanee Wallis?

27:26.212 --> 27:27.680
- Yeah.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.782
- We're gonna get you
outta here, okay?

27:31.317 --> 27:34.220
- Hey!
Chicago PD! Open up!

27:35.822 --> 27:38.858
- It won't work.
We're trapped.

27:56.075 --> 27:56.608
- Did we get a sketch yet?

27:57.476 --> 28:00.046
- Burgess is finishing up with
the witness.

28:02.414 --> 28:04.083
Who's Abby?

28:08.454 --> 28:10.156
She's been blowing up
your phone,

28:10.189 --> 28:11.223
sent, like, five texts

28:11.257 --> 28:13.359
while you were in the shower
last week.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.429
I been waiting for you
to tell me who this chick is,

28:17.463 --> 28:20.466
but it looks like
I'm just gonna have to ask.

28:28.775 --> 28:31.343
- Um...

28:31.377 --> 28:36.082
Abby ran Cultural Support
my last tour in Kandahar.

28:36.115 --> 28:42.054
About a year after I came home,
I saw her at a funeral in Vegas.

28:42.088 --> 28:46.893
Was--was a guy in our unit,
he had redeployed,

28:46.926 --> 28:49.095
and, um, he didn't--

28:50.496 --> 28:53.299
Um, I was, like,
blacking out most nights,

28:53.332 --> 28:55.802
and we were both
pretty shook up.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.905
And, um, we got married.
[chuckles]

29:01.207 --> 29:02.374
It was, like,
a 24-hour thing,

29:02.408 --> 29:06.412
it was a total joke,
and it is long over.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.350
- Jay, you married this girl,

29:11.383 --> 29:13.385
and you never told me.

29:15.521 --> 29:18.524
And you were never
gonna tell me.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.528
[knocking at the door]

29:23.562 --> 29:26.365
- Hey.
Um, we got a composite.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.434
We should get this out
on citywide, right?

29:29.969 --> 29:31.137
- Let me see that.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.377
Are you seeing this?

29:38.410 --> 29:39.478
- Seeing what?

29:39.511 --> 29:41.848
- It's him.
It's Darren Crane.

29:41.881 --> 29:42.915
- He's deceased.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.117
- As of a year ago.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.385
Darren owned the cabin.

29:46.418 --> 29:49.521
What if it was his corporation
he "sold it" to?

29:49.555 --> 29:51.190
He stole the container.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.926
Our witness met him
three years ago

29:53.960 --> 29:56.128
when he answered
this Craigslist ad.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.429
It's him.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.832
- Doesn't make any sense.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.868
Maybe there's
a third conspirator?

30:01.901 --> 30:04.203
Did Ruzek get anything
from the widow?

30:04.236 --> 30:06.873
- I mean, I called him
20 minutes ago.

30:07.874 --> 30:09.175
There was no answer.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.261
- [whispering] Go.
- Chicago PD!

30:30.229 --> 30:31.397
- Oh.
- Two of my detectives

30:31.430 --> 30:34.200
came here. They're parked
out front. Have you seen 'em?

30:34.233 --> 30:35.902
- No.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.203
- No?

30:37.236 --> 30:39.238
- Hey, Ruz! Atwater!
- No.

30:39.271 --> 30:40.572
- Turn this place
inside out.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.874
- You can't do that.

30:41.908 --> 30:44.176
- Geraldine, where are
my detectives?

30:44.210 --> 30:45.978
- I have no idea what you're
talking about.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.014
I'd like to speak
with your supervisor.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.982
- My Commander?
- Clear.

30:50.016 --> 30:53.252
- She's on her way.
You're not gonna like her.

30:53.285 --> 30:55.321
- Hey!
- Kevin! Adam!

31:07.033 --> 31:08.534
Hey, Sarge!

31:15.975 --> 31:17.443
- I've never seen that before
in my life.

31:17.476 --> 31:18.644
- Me either.
Open the door.

31:18.677 --> 31:19.645
- I wouldn't know how.

31:19.678 --> 31:20.646
- Open it!

31:20.679 --> 31:21.981
- My husband must have
put that in.

31:22.014 --> 31:22.982
I don't know anything
about--

31:23.015 --> 31:24.616
- What's the code?

31:24.650 --> 31:26.485
- I'm telling you,
I have no idea.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.554
- And I'm telling you
I know you do know,

31:28.587 --> 31:30.689
and I know that girl
is in there.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.358
Did you do something
to my men?

31:32.391 --> 31:34.560
- I can't open that door!

31:35.962 --> 31:37.997
- Come here. Come on.
- No.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.370
Let me go!
Where are you taking me?

31:46.605 --> 31:48.640
[grunts]

31:58.050 --> 32:01.253
- You really think I'm not gonna
get through that door?

32:01.287 --> 32:03.322
Hmm?

32:05.557 --> 32:07.960
Shanee Wallis.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.063
Is she alive?

32:11.097 --> 32:13.299
- I don't know
who that is.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.439
- What's the code
on the door?

32:20.472 --> 32:22.975
- I don't know.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.943
[whimpering]

32:25.711 --> 32:28.280
Listen to me.
- Huh?

32:28.314 --> 32:30.049
Listen to me.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.987
You do something
to my detectives?

32:35.021 --> 32:37.389
- You wouldn't dare.

32:37.423 --> 32:40.459
You don't have anything.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.394
No proof!

32:43.595 --> 32:46.498
- What's the code
on the door?

32:58.710 --> 32:58.910
- Well?

32:59.778 --> 33:00.679
- No way, this is
2-inch steel plate.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.081
- I'll call CFD.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.086
- [screams]

33:08.354 --> 33:10.556
- 3737.

33:15.294 --> 33:17.196
- Go.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.730
- Adam! Kevin!

33:18.764 --> 33:19.998
- In here!

33:22.768 --> 33:24.603
- Hey.
We need an ambulance, bro.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.238
She needs help.

33:30.209 --> 33:33.812
- Incorporation documents
off your computer.

33:33.845 --> 33:38.050
You created the LLC that
purchased your husband's cabin.

33:38.084 --> 33:40.152
You put it
in Austin Forchette's name,

33:40.186 --> 33:42.654
and then your forged
his signature, like, 60 times.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.656
- I wouldn't even know
how to do that.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.292
- You paid
the hostage consultant

33:46.325 --> 33:48.327
out of a bank account
you opened in Delaware

33:48.360 --> 33:49.728
in Austin's name.

33:49.761 --> 33:52.798
- [groans] If anyone did that,
it was Darren.

33:53.832 --> 33:56.068
He kept so many things
from me.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.771
- Then how'd you know
the code to the door?

33:59.805 --> 34:01.039
- 37?

34:02.174 --> 34:04.410
Darren's favorite number.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.312
He uses it all the time.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.780
This was just some game
they made up.

34:08.813 --> 34:12.050
- Oh, so you admit
you knew it?

34:14.219 --> 34:17.054
You admit it.
Yeah?

34:19.725 --> 34:23.094
- What was I supposed to do?

34:23.129 --> 34:25.397
Yeah, I was trying to be
the perfect wife.

34:27.366 --> 34:30.335
- Geraldine, you like
blaming other people.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.838
- I like telling the truth.

34:32.871 --> 34:37.676
- Yeah, well, maybe Darren
started this whole game...

34:37.708 --> 34:41.179
but you kept playing
after he died.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.815
And I think you hired
that half-assed consultant

34:43.849 --> 34:45.417
because you wanted it all
to end,

34:45.451 --> 34:50.322
but then when we showed up
at your door...

34:50.356 --> 34:52.658
you couldn't look us
in the eye.

34:55.927 --> 34:59.198
- You were starving that girl
to death in your home.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.634
And then you separated
the two girls,

35:02.668 --> 35:05.471
and you were only feeding
one of 'em.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.674
Help me understand that,
or no jury will.

35:16.215 --> 35:19.751
- Darren found that boy.

35:19.785 --> 35:25.391
He gave him work to keep him
out of trouble.

35:25.424 --> 35:29.461
He heard voices,
he told me.

35:29.495 --> 35:33.332
Darren tried, but that boy
is out of control.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.401
He does not know
right from wrong.

35:39.238 --> 35:42.274
- You can't put this
on Austin anymore.

35:44.543 --> 35:47.213
He shot himself in the head
yesterday.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.783
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

35:51.817 --> 35:54.186
Yeah, this is the gun
he used.

35:57.456 --> 36:01.493
And this is him about--mm,
ten minutes after he bled out.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.267
- They aren't real.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.901
- Hmm.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.170
- They can't be real.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.210
What are these?

36:35.361 --> 36:37.463
- Well, I'm confused.

36:37.496 --> 36:40.332
Was the husband the mastermind,
or was it her the whole time?

36:40.366 --> 36:42.768
- Kid, what are you
looking for?

36:42.801 --> 36:45.804
They can tell you all day long
why they killed someone.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.873
You're still not gonna
sleep any easier.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.588
- You were worried about me
when I was trapped

37:02.621 --> 37:04.256
down there,
weren't you?

37:04.290 --> 37:07.326
- That's not even close
to what I was just thinking.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.798
- Yeah, it was.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.378
- It's this one.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.919
- [sighs]

37:36.555 --> 37:39.791
- I should have
listened to you.

37:39.825 --> 37:42.961
Cops don't like to admit
when their instincts are wrong.

37:42.994 --> 37:47.265
- Honestly, I wouldn't have
believed my story either.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.641
- Hey.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.843
Hey, you.
- Hey.

37:57.876 --> 38:00.412
- Come here.

38:01.580 --> 38:04.015
- [sighs]

38:04.049 --> 38:05.984
- Wilson is running
through the showers

38:06.017 --> 38:08.420
wearing nothing
but a Kevlar vest, right?

38:08.454 --> 38:09.888
- [laughs]
Well, the lieutenant said,

38:09.921 --> 38:12.858
"All outdoor activities to be
conducted in body armor."

38:12.891 --> 38:13.859
- [laughs]
- Do you remember,

38:13.892 --> 38:17.829
he had his girlfriend's name
tattooed on his ass?

38:17.863 --> 38:19.898
- Did he tell you that was
his girlfriend?

38:19.931 --> 38:21.933
That was his dog's name.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.669
[both laughing]

38:23.702 --> 38:25.036
- That actually makes
more sense.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.338
- I know.

38:27.539 --> 38:29.675
- I could do
another one of these.

38:29.708 --> 38:33.645
- Um, no, I shouldn't.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.347
- Gotta get to the barracks?

38:35.381 --> 38:37.115
- We didn't drink enough
back then?

38:37.148 --> 38:40.619
- See, I think we could've
drank a little more.

38:42.153 --> 38:45.357
Maybe fixed things.

38:49.428 --> 38:50.896
- Maybe.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.967
It's good seeing you.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.036
I didn't think
it would be.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.205
- [laughs]

39:00.238 --> 39:04.109
- Um, I should probably sign
the papers and get going though.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.378
- I don't have 'em.

39:07.579 --> 39:11.617
I don't have them.
There's no one in Philly.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.387
- Abby.

39:19.157 --> 39:21.527
- I never told you
that I loved you.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.898
Even the day
that we got married.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.500
Didn't feel right.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.939
But I did.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.510
I really did.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.649
- Abby,

39:43.682 --> 39:46.985
you deserve
everything good.

39:48.787 --> 39:51.957
I'm just not the guy
that's gonna give it to you.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.107
- [sighs]

40:30.696 --> 40:32.230
- Hey.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.999
- Hey.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.134
- Um...

40:36.167 --> 40:39.004
I'm gonna go stay at Will's
for a little while.

40:39.037 --> 40:41.006
- You don't have to do that.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.613
- I love you.

40:47.646 --> 40:51.249
And I want to stay.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.984
Um...

40:53.018 --> 40:55.120
Who I was back then,
I'm not proud of it,

40:55.153 --> 40:59.658
and--and I know you think
that everything's behind,

40:59.691 --> 41:03.495
but it's not.

41:03.529 --> 41:06.665
And I'm still married,
and I gotta sort that out,

41:06.698 --> 41:09.200
and if--and--

41:09.234 --> 41:12.470
and I just don't think
I should be here right now.

41:13.805 --> 41:18.109
- Whatever it is,
I can handle it.

41:18.143 --> 41:21.713
- I don't know.

41:21.747 --> 41:25.517
I guess that's what I gotta go
figure out now.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.164
I'm sorry.

42:29.180 --> 42:29.314
.
