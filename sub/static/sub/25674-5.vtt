[cell door slams]

[doorbell rings]

01:21.790 --> 01:22.665
[Ginger] Ugh.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.710
Hey, guys. I thought you were
flaming shitbag number four.

01:25.794 --> 01:29.380
Ugh. Gosh. Slam it, Luschek!
Your entire driveway is covered.

01:29.464 --> 01:30.548
-This is my nightmare.
-Ugh.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.885
Yeah. The neighborhood kids
started Mischief Night a day early.

01:33.968 --> 01:38.181
I'm a target 'cause I like to crush
their skate ramps with my car. [chuckles]

01:38.264 --> 01:40.934
-Whoa.
-Come on in. Uh, take your shoes off.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.853
[children shouting indistinctly]

01:47.982 --> 01:52.153
Hey, I know alcohol is a gateway drug,
so I got you a Coke.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.364
Caffeine is also a gateway drug.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.160
Trust me, you're gonna need it.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.204
Alvarez has a way
of putting people to sleep.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.748
Everyone, your attention please.
Before we begin the draft,

02:03.832 --> 02:06.209
I'd like to go over
some standard operating procedures

02:06.292 --> 02:09.712
as well as some adjustments to
the scoring paradigms since last season.

02:09.796 --> 02:13.299
Please refer to page six in the packet
of your folders in order to follow along.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.051
Oh, I forgot my folder.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.469
We can share, honey.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.848
As always, all point-earning events

02:19.931 --> 02:23.017
must be witnessed by a third-party CO
in order to be counted.

02:23.101 --> 02:26.563
All mid-season trades must be approved
by me, your commissioner.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.899
Also, we have a zero-tolerance policy
for interference,

02:29.983 --> 02:32.193
which includes influencing, coercing,

02:32.277 --> 02:34.946
or manipulating inmate behavior
in order to earn points.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.823
-[burps]
-Al, we're all honest here.

02:36.906 --> 02:40.160
As far as scoring changes,
in the sexual category,

02:40.243 --> 02:43.163
scissoring has been bumped to 11 points
because it's not a thing.

02:43.246 --> 02:47.876
Oral and digital sex have been bumped
to five points each, giving or receiving.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.586
Digital? Like cyber? -I think he means fingerbanging.
-[laughs]

02:52.255 --> 02:53.256
What about hand-holding?

02:53.339 --> 02:55.800
-Arguably the most intimate act there is.
-Uh, maybe next year.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.721
In the emotional category,
bulimics are one point per vomit.

02:59.804 --> 03:03.057
Suicide has been pushed to 20,
failed attempt, ten.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.684
And finally, in the physical category,

03:04.767 --> 03:07.562
gang altercations,
now ten points per inmate.

03:07.645 --> 03:12.191
Murder has been bumped to 30 points,
murdered to 25.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.987
Escaped inmate is now 40 points,
but a recapture remains at five.

03:16.070 --> 03:19.449
Pregnancy is nine
with twins as a multiplier, obviously.

03:19.532 --> 03:23.119
Now, in the back of your folder,
you will find a list of inmate names

03:23.202 --> 03:25.246
as well as a roster board for the draft.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.957
These pencils are expensive,

03:28.041 --> 03:30.251
so please return them to me
at the end of the evening.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.379
Or we could use FanDraft.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.299
-What's FanDraft?
-[music playing on TV]

03:39.052 --> 03:43.097
Yeah. I hacked the software
so I could input the inmate data.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.642
Pretty amazing what you can accomplish
in a flow state.

03:45.725 --> 03:46.726
-Fuck me!
-That's awesome.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.686
I think we found ourselves
a new commissioner.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.271
-[laughs]
-All in favor?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.356
Yeah.

03:51.439 --> 03:54.359
All he did was input the data
from the folder that I made.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.903
Yeah, but it's futuristic now.
And there's music.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.947
Why don't you have a seat, Al?

04:01.407 --> 04:05.745
Sorry, Al. You had a good run,
but I'm a visual learner.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.289
You should try
some of this chili cheese dip.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.624
It's got a real kick.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.384
[Lorna] <i>♪ And if that diamond ring</i>
<i>Turns brass ♪</i>

04:19.467 --> 04:23.137
<i>♪ Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass ♪</i>

04:23.221 --> 04:26.474
<i>♪ And if that looking glass gets broke ♪</i>

04:26.557 --> 04:30.436
<i>♪ Mama's gonna buy you a nice fur coat</i>
<i>And if that-- ♪</i>

04:30.520 --> 04:34.148
It's "billy goat" not "fur coat." [grunts]

04:34.232 --> 04:38.444
Uh, no, I don't think so.
What would a baby do with a billy goat?

04:38.528 --> 04:41.656
They actually make great pets.
Their screams sound like human screams.

04:41.739 --> 04:42.991
It's very hilarious.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.618
Well, I can tell you that my baby
is gonna have fur.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.414
Vinnie, my husband, he's already
got him a little mini mink. [chuckles]

04:49.497 --> 04:51.040
His cousin is an importer.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.793
You know, when my Andrea was pregnant
the first time,

04:53.876 --> 04:56.421
-ooh, she had terrible insomnia, too.
-Mmm.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.841
She had five babies inside her.
Kept her up all night.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.926
Probably why she ate two of them.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.638
Did you just say she ate them?

05:05.722 --> 05:08.224
Only two.
At first I thought they just ran away,

05:08.308 --> 05:10.184
-but then I found pieces.
-[toilet flushes]

05:10.268 --> 05:12.979
Foot here, ear there. I get it.

05:13.062 --> 05:17.191
Being a mother is thankless work.
Want to meet her?

05:18.109 --> 05:21.154
Normally I wouldn't,
but she's pregnant again.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.531
Maybe you can support each other.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.075
-There you are.
-[squeaking]

05:26.159 --> 05:28.286
Oh, my God. That is disgusting.

05:28.369 --> 05:31.247
Oh. Why? It's just life.
If you're going to have a baby,

05:31.331 --> 05:34.334
you better get used to seeing
much worse than this. Trust me.

05:34.417 --> 05:38.838
The one with the white ear is Andrea.
And those are her kids cuddling with her.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.883
I call them the Leftovers. [chuckles]

05:41.966 --> 05:44.719
-This is a food joke. Mmm.
-Ah.

05:44.802 --> 05:50.391
I guess they are kind of cute...
in a disgusting way.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.518
Go on. They don't bite.

05:52.602 --> 05:57.190
Actually, that's a lie.
They do bite. Really freaking hard.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.983
Hi!

05:59.067 --> 06:01.819
[Linda] <i>And senior vice president</i>
<i>certainly comes with its challenges.</i>

06:01.903 --> 06:04.113
I mean, the press on this thing's
been a nightmare.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.449
Not to mention
getting everyone to cooperate.

06:07.408 --> 06:08.618
Oh.

06:09.452 --> 06:13.706
Luckily, I do have experience from my past
in rescuing an image.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.625
Our sorority almost lost its charter.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.418
I bet. Love the wig, by the way.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.046
Oh, thank you.
Real human hair, courtesy of MCC.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.297
I'd let you touch it,

06:21.380 --> 06:23.966
but with all the lice in the prisons,
you can't be too careful.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.051
[Fig] Uh-huh.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.222
I'm not normally a merlot girl,
but this Napa Valley is gorgeous.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.431
Sure you don't want some?

06:30.515 --> 06:33.267
Was there something specific
you wanted to talk to me about?

06:33.351 --> 06:36.979
Or did you call me in after hours
for a wine tasting?

06:38.773 --> 06:42.443
Uh, look, Natalie, I called you here

06:42.527 --> 06:45.154
because I wanted to get started
on the right foot.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.697
I don't wanna be one of those bosses

06:46.781 --> 06:48.324
who's cruel and condescending

06:48.407 --> 06:50.284
-to her female subordinates.
-Mmm.

06:50.368 --> 06:53.579
I would like to foster a positive
working relationship with MCC,

06:53.663 --> 06:55.498
not the contentious one

06:55.581 --> 06:57.959
that your predecessor, Joe Caputo,
was so committed to.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.210
Well, I'm not Joe.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.587
We approach things very differently,
he and I.

07:01.671 --> 07:04.465
Good, 'cause that man
was a massive liability. [scoffs]

07:04.549 --> 07:07.176
His incompetence led to a prison riot,
for God's sake.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.846
Not to mention his ethics,
or lack of, I should say.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.265
I know he conspired
to keep me in the prison for days

07:12.348 --> 07:15.017
even though he knew there was
an extra inmate in the final count.

07:16.018 --> 07:21.190
Actually, the final count was one short
until we found escaped inmate Chang,

07:21.274 --> 07:23.359
sleeping inside
a hollowed-out deer carcass.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.944
Then Joe must have fudged the numbers,

07:25.027 --> 07:28.489
because how else did I wind up in Ohio
with a crotch full of pubic lice?

07:28.573 --> 07:29.782
-Oh, Jesus.
-[scoffs]

07:29.866 --> 07:31.367
Yeah, I know. Despicable, right?

07:31.451 --> 07:34.036
Joe is an asshole.
I fucked him, too, several times.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.706
Terrible person.
But he didn't fudge the numbers.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.958
The final count was even,

07:39.041 --> 07:41.502
which means
we have even bigger problems here.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.548
So, you... You two... That son of a bitch.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.718
If you replaced an inmate
in the final count,

07:48.801 --> 07:51.512
then the inmate that you replaced
was never counted.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.765
Let us recall
the oh-so-tempting giant hole

07:54.849 --> 07:56.058
in the prison's fence.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.394
Someone needs to call a manhunt.
I need to call a manhunt.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.729
Actually, that's my job,

07:59.812 --> 08:03.107
but it looks like your PR nightmare
is just getting started.

08:05.067 --> 08:09.197
Oh, and sorry about the lice, by the way.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.283
Joe always did like a full bush.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.954
Ooh! [cheers]

08:17.038 --> 08:18.831
Someone owes us another round. I spent all my money
on loaded funnel cake.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.793
Come on. A bet's a bet, bro.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.712
All right. Three more, please.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.675
[man] Man, I'd let those two
handle my balls.

08:29.759 --> 08:33.137
-Don't you only got the one?
-It's a figure of speech.

08:34.180 --> 08:38.518
Yeah. I would love to put my penis
inside her vagina. [chuckles]

08:39.894 --> 08:41.687
Or butt.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.607
Yeah, butts are the new vaginas,
if you ask me.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.109
Damn right. I second that.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.112
Wait. Isn't your wife's butt off-limits
since the surgery?

08:50.196 --> 08:52.573

What? Why? It sounds like they're
just figuring this out now.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.901
That means we got at least
a couple weeks on 'em.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.820
That's plenty of time
to get across to Canada.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.531
Look, I've tried to run before.
But they'll catch us.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.326
Unless you kill yourself.
Then you can die free.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.288
Sorry.

09:40.371 --> 09:43.833
So, what?
You're just gonna turn yourself in?

09:43.916 --> 09:46.460

10:11.444 --> 10:14.071
I shouldn't have grabbed you. I'm sorry.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.199
Look, you just said you wanted
to have a normal life, right?

10:17.283 --> 10:20.328
And you can have that. With me. In Canada.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.705
Health care is free! And I can support us.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.333
I can do everything.
You won't even have to leave the house.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.336
-That sounds like prison again.
-That's not what I meant.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.378
What if we get caught?

10:29.462 --> 10:33.466
Are you trying to tell me you're willing
to put everything aside and go to prison?

10:33.549 --> 10:37.386
If it means I got a shot with you,
then fuck it. I don't care. Okay?

10:38.012 --> 10:40.139
It's less than 100 miles to the border.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.516
And we can hike right past it
through Wood Falls.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.687
There is an old campsite I used to go to
as a kid up there. It's beautiful.

10:46.771 --> 10:50.358
Didn't you say you always wanted us
to go camping together? Yeah?

10:50.441 --> 10:51.442
You have a tent?

10:52.026 --> 10:53.653
Maybe. I can check in the trunk.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.989
There ain't a tent in that trunk,
because I would have felt it. Trust me.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.158
I'm just gonna check. I'll be right back.

No. I can't do that.
I'm not gonna leave him high and dry.

Some ladies like a man
that bosses them around.

Hell, sometimes the only way I can get off
is with a foot on my face.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.310
No. It's not even like that, okay?

11:26.394 --> 11:28.312

[grunts] Oh, that's my Uber.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.279
You leavin'? Wait.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.127
[Dixon sighs]

11:56.757 --> 11:58.175
[sighs] Fuck.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.601
There's no tent. I'll make a lean-to.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.229
Where'd he go?

12:15.276 --> 12:19.029
I guess caffeine really is a gateway drug.
Okay, Blake, your go.

12:19.113 --> 12:23.617
[laughs] Okay. [coughs] Um... um...

12:23.701 --> 12:25.161
Carol Denning. [chuckles]

12:25.244 --> 12:27.913
Oh, rookie mistake.
The two queenpin sisters,

12:27.997 --> 12:31.167
they keep their noses cleaner
than a porn star's asshole.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.170
Plus, C and D block,
they haven't had a real bout in years.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.463
[Ginger] Only a matter of time.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.506
This prison's wealth gap
is not sustainable.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.675
I guess somebody listened to a podcast.

12:39.758 --> 12:42.928
Okay, Blake. You pick again.
We're snakin'.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.472
Uh...

12:45.556 --> 12:46.807
Barbara Denning.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.851
-[chuckling]
-Give me that.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.064
-Dayanara Diaz.
-Ooh, the guard killer.

12:54.648 --> 12:57.735
I got a thing for her mom.
Plus, night crying is three points.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.612
Two points, actual--

12:59.695 --> 13:01.822
But, you know,
I'm not the commissioner anymore, so...

13:01.906 --> 13:05.242
Aw! Moving right along. Virginia?

13:05.910 --> 13:07.077
Piper Chapman.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.329
[grunts]

13:08.412 --> 13:10.748
Seriously?
What do you want with Piper Chapman?

13:10.831 --> 13:13.375
That's none
of your motherfracking business.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.711
Wow, Ginge,
that's pretty close to cursing.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.671
We don't want an incident
like last year, do we?

13:17.755 --> 13:19.882
I know, I know.
I let the poop hit the fan last year.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.468
Okay. Stefanovic?

13:22.551 --> 13:24.011
I'll take Nicky Nichols.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.846
Fuck! Mother... Shit!

13:25.930 --> 13:27.723
Nice. I hear she's a real pussy slayer.

13:27.806 --> 13:28.974
-Fuck!
-Solid pick.

13:30.851 --> 13:35.231
You guys...
what if Joseph Smith made it all up?

13:35.314 --> 13:37.316
[toilet flushes]

13:39.735 --> 13:41.779
McCullough, your turn. [clears throat]

13:47.243 --> 13:48.619
Maria Ruiz.

13:54.208 --> 13:58.170
Oh, fucking mess. Mischief Night
isn't supposed to be until tomorrow.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.131
What the hell is Mischief Night, anyway?

14:01.215 --> 14:06.095
Where I come from, we celebrate Halloween
and Halloween only, like Americans.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.973
Yeah, well... [grunts]
it's an East Coast thing.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.100
But people take this shit serious.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.352
Something crazy always goes down.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.563
Last year a bunch of girls
got Bloody Mary'd.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.022
What's that?

14:17.106 --> 14:19.650
When you rub a used pad on someone's face
while she's sleeping.

14:19.733 --> 14:23.070
Next morning, ladies were going nuts
thinkin' they were marked by the devil.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.239
Or 'cause someone rubbed period blood
on their face. But either way, lots of shrieking.

14:27.491 --> 14:31.287
I don't believe any of that ghost shit.
Except the Holy Ghost.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.748
-And God and Jesus. And the Virgin Mary.
-[Vazquez] They're here, you know.

14:34.832 --> 14:38.002
My girl Rita said she saw the whole posse
one night in the guard bathroom.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.046
-She had a vision.
-[scoffs and chuckles]

14:41.130 --> 14:42.840
Did I say somethin' funny, cookie?

14:42.923 --> 14:46.635
Ain't nothing scary about ghosts.
It's people you gotta look out for.

14:49.263 --> 14:52.725
[scoffs] You should be lookin' out.
I hear bitches are comin' for you.

14:53.392 --> 14:57.396
Come on, let's go clean the breakroom.
I don't like this one's mopey face.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.024
Mopey's nothin'.
Wait till somebody smashes it in.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.693
That's when it's gonna be hard to look at.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.245
[sighs]

15:31.680 --> 15:33.599
I can't believe I'm awake right now.

15:33.682 --> 15:39.271
Yeah, I just drank two 5-hour Energies,
so I should be good for, like, ten hours.

15:39.355 --> 15:42.775
Inmate Nichols, time for work.

15:42.858 --> 15:48.614
Hey, come on. Hey, what could possibly
need cleaning at this ungodly hour?

15:48.697 --> 15:49.782
Nicky! [chuckles]

15:52.201 --> 15:53.369
Hey, neighbor.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.123
I think I saw a tit grab. That's a point.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.167
Break it up. Break it up!

16:01.043 --> 16:02.753
I'm so glad you're okay.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.339
"Okay" is definitely
on the list of things I am not,

16:05.422 --> 16:08.258
but I am happy to see
your psychotic cherub face.

16:08.342 --> 16:12.638
All right. Mops, buckets, frowns.
Let's go.

16:12.721 --> 16:15.140
So, what happened out there?
Did they give you more time?

16:15.224 --> 16:17.601
They tried,
but I was able to weasel my way out.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.145
All it took was reconnecting
with my broken condom of a father

16:20.229 --> 16:24.149
and then condemning the first human being
who ever truly cared about me.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.360
So, went well.

16:26.443 --> 16:29.488
Oh, you mean Red. Why? [stammers]
What's gonna happen to her? [stammers] I don't know.
They want her to burn for the riot,

16:32.700 --> 16:37.121
and I just handed them the torch
to save my own ass.

16:38.580 --> 16:42.209
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
all of us who surrendered,

16:42.292 --> 16:47.548
we didn't get any extra time, right?
So... thanks to you...

16:47.631 --> 16:51.260
I surrendered. It kinda evens out
when you think about it.

16:51.343 --> 16:55.389
Well, I'm not sure it exactly works
that way, but I appreciate the effort.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.725
No, Nicky, you can't blame yourself.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.978
It's every man for themselves.
See, I joined a gang.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.814
We're called D block, and we hate C block

17:03.897 --> 17:06.275
because they got the good job
and feather pillows,

17:06.358 --> 17:08.694
and because of what happened
last Valentine's Day,

17:08.777 --> 17:10.320
no one's allowed to celebrate anymore.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.948
I am familiar with the arbitrary,
pod-based gang warfare

17:13.032 --> 17:14.742
from my last staycation down here.

17:14.825 --> 17:18.579
You know, I cannot say that it ends well
for those involved.

17:18.662 --> 17:21.832
Probably not the best idea
for that fetus growing inside you, yeah?

17:21.915 --> 17:25.627
Oh, trust me, the gang thing
is the easiest part of this pregnancy.

17:25.711 --> 17:30.799
I had no idea about the discharge,
my nipples the size of helipads.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.177
And the insomnia. Oh, the insomnia.

17:33.260 --> 17:37.222
I was awake all night
playing with my bunkie's pet rats.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.933
Jeez, Lorna,
rats are disease-carrying vermin.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.645
They're gonna give your baby microcephali,
or macrocephali.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.649
The point is, the goal is,
you want normal cephali.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.027
Nicky, I've missed you.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.864
I missed you, too. Tell me more
about these helipad nipples you have.

17:53.947 --> 17:56.533
-Like, how big are we talking?
-[Lorna] Huge.

17:56.617 --> 18:00.204
Good... morning, Litchfield Max!

18:00.287 --> 18:05.375
Rise and shine, and welcome
to another crisp October day.

18:05.459 --> 18:10.214
Tomorrow is Halloween,
which means tonight is Mischief Night.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.548
And I know some of you feel

18:11.632 --> 18:16.637
like this is your chance
to exorcise your inner demons,

18:16.720 --> 18:19.473
but I urge you to ask yourself,

18:19.556 --> 18:23.727
"Is that really... the kind of energy
I want to be putting out into the world?

18:23.811 --> 18:28.816
What if, instead, I spent the day
performing acts of kindness?"

18:28.899 --> 18:33.695
Maybe surprise someone
with a non-sexual favor for them,

18:33.779 --> 18:38.117
or giving them
a non-sexual body compliment,

18:38.200 --> 18:42.913
or letting them know
that they have dried blood on their face.

18:42.996 --> 18:47.209
<i>I wish someone had let me know that.</i>
<i>Nobody told me until lunch. </i>

18:47.292 --> 18:51.004
<i>And by that time, my T-zone</i>
<i>was already starting to break out...</i>

18:53.132 --> 18:54.633
[Piper coughing]

18:56.593 --> 18:58.262
[choking and coughing]

18:58.345 --> 18:59.805
[laughs]

18:59.888 --> 19:01.807
Happy Mischief Day, roomie!

19:01.890 --> 19:03.350
What the fuck?

19:03.433 --> 19:06.311
Good old cheese-in-the-nose prank.
Gets 'em every time.

19:06.395 --> 19:09.022
Putting cheese in someone's nose
is not a prank.

19:09.106 --> 19:12.693
Well, let's see.
Made at least one person laugh. Ha! Me.

19:12.776 --> 19:16.947
Made at least one person sad. You.
Sounds like a prank to me.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.116
I can't hear anything that you're saying.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.952
Oh, yeah, I, uh...
I put some in your ears, too.

19:24.371 --> 19:27.916
-[gasps]
-[chuckles] Is it a prank now?

19:30.669 --> 19:34.173
-[sighs]
-Not so fast, snaggletooth.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.176
I'm gonna need you
to fill my commissary today.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.385
But I don't have any money.

19:38.468 --> 19:42.222
Nice try.
Too bad a little birdie named Stella

19:42.306 --> 19:45.100
told me all about you
and your privileged ass

19:45.184 --> 19:46.602
before she flew the coop.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.730
If I had to hear the name Piper
one more time I would've strangled her.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.190
You must've really made her mad.

19:51.273 --> 19:55.319
Anyway, you owe me for putting
your new girlfriend next door.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.988
-It's only fair.
-We did not ask you to do that.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.365
But I did it, so you owe me.

20:01.116 --> 20:03.076
Or do you wanna get tough about it?

20:05.746 --> 20:07.497
Fine. I'll do it.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.718
That woman is a fucking nightmare.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.553
Good morning to you, too.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.764
She put cheese in my face.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.016
That's not even a real prank.
Who does that?

20:26.099 --> 20:29.394
Plus, she wants me to fill her commissary.
This is full-on extortion.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.979
Can we take it down a couple notches?

20:31.063 --> 20:34.066
My arm killed me all night
and I haven't slept.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.860
I hate this place.

20:36.944 --> 20:41.073
Bosses, gang warfare, extortion.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.118
Since when are we living in <i>The Godfather?</i>

20:45.202 --> 20:47.871
Murphy's Irish, so it's more <i>The Departed.</i>

20:47.955 --> 20:50.082
Don't they all get shot in the face
at the end of that?

20:50.165 --> 20:51.541
Doesn't sound very promising.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.920
Listen, she's trying
to establish herself as alpha.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.631
Might as well roll onto your back
and let her sniff your genitals.

20:57.714 --> 21:00.926
Next week she'll get bored
and find some other beta bitch to pick on.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.720
I can only handle
so much genital sniffing.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.599
-Now I'm going to go handle cheese.
-Hmm.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.185
As a treat. You gonna come?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.812
Can't. I'm infirm.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.647
So I'll meet you in the yard?

21:13.730 --> 21:15.983
Look at us. Meeting for recess.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.944
[sniffs] Is that Gruyère? Nah. Too nutty.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.658
[indistinct chatter] [door buzzes]

21:34.626 --> 21:36.378
That wasn't what I think it was, was it?

21:36.461 --> 21:39.464
That depends. Did you think
it was a dead woman on a cart?

21:39.548 --> 21:43.302
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. You didn't... did you?

21:43.969 --> 21:45.554
-'Course not.
-[sighs]

21:45.637 --> 21:50.267
I know better than to off a good cellmate.
She was clean and quiet,

21:50.350 --> 21:52.602
and especially after she died.

21:52.686 --> 21:56.273
The last three days have been heavenly.
Minus the smell.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.526
Yeah. I know death is a part
of the circle of life.

21:59.609 --> 22:02.446
It's in every Disney movie
and some Pixar movies like <i>Up,</i>

22:02.529 --> 22:03.989
and some movies like <i>Stepmom.</i>

22:04.072 --> 22:07.451
But death gives me the gloomy-doomies.

22:07.534 --> 22:11.204
Can you give me some space here?
I'm trying to grieve.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.874
Mommy says that the best thing
for the gloomy-doomies

22:13.957 --> 22:16.835
is to be with friends,
but I don't have any here.

22:16.918 --> 22:18.628
Who are your friends, bunker lady?

22:18.712 --> 22:21.006
All I got is enemies these days.

22:21.089 --> 22:23.550
I could request to be your roommate.

22:24.259 --> 22:26.136
It's good to have company when you grieve.

22:26.219 --> 22:29.931
It's what the Jews call a, um, a shiver.
So you don't get cold.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.808
[stammers] Yeah, no offense,

22:31.892 --> 22:35.854
but I'd rather be locked in a cage
with a swarm of bees.

22:35.937 --> 22:37.856
Is that a no? Some people love bees.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.983
No. Hey, it's almost outside time.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.819
I've noticed that you always skip
outside time like I do.

22:42.903 --> 22:46.156
I've always wanted to go,
but I was never great at playground.

22:46.239 --> 22:49.576
Maybe, you and I, we can go together.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.370
Like friends. Not a date.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.125
Look, I'm not your damn prison mommy.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.504
You want friends, go make 'em yourself.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.798
If you're not gonna go,
then I'm not gonna go.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.801
You do what you want,
but don't do it in here.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.302
Get out of my cell

23:07.385 --> 23:10.514
before they have to carry you out
on a stretcher.

23:33.995 --> 23:37.624
So... they squealed on you, too, hmm?

23:39.334 --> 23:40.919
I guess it's just us now.

23:41.878 --> 23:47.551
The Russian and the black.
Like villains in a bad '80s action movie.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.177
Or any action movie.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.720
My girls ain't snitches.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.472
And yet here you are.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.767
How did you do it?

23:56.476 --> 23:59.896
I mean, it was so dark
after they blew that door open.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.189
And all that screaming.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.691
I didn't kill anybody.

24:02.774 --> 24:05.569
We both watched him
walk out of that room alive.

24:05.652 --> 24:08.321
And when they stormed,
I was dragged out in cuffs. Okay, so if you didn't kill him
and I didn't kill him,

24:11.158 --> 24:12.325
who the fuck did?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.995
Oh, I don't know for sure
you didn't kill him.

24:15.078 --> 24:17.372
[sighs] I didn't kill him.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.584
I suppose it doesn't matter now.

24:21.418 --> 24:26.631
They want us to go down,
regardless of what we did or didn't do.

24:26.715 --> 24:29.217
I ain't going down for shit I didn't do.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.721
And I ain't spending the rest of my life
in this fucked-up place.

24:33.597 --> 24:34.598
It's funny.

24:35.557 --> 24:38.852
After so many years,
it starts to feel like your home.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.147
And that these people are your family.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.400
Until you stop being useful.

24:45.483 --> 24:48.528
Then poof. They're gone.

24:48.612 --> 24:51.615
And you remember
that this is not your home

24:51.698 --> 24:54.159
and that you are alone here.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.621
Well, at least you got a real family
waiting for you.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.873
Inmates, let's go.

25:11.635 --> 25:15.805
Oh. Check, check, check it out.
Your MVP is all alone.

25:15.889 --> 25:19.059
Might be a good time to toss her.
Could get a day cry out of it.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.646
I thought
we weren't supposed to interfere.

25:22.729 --> 25:25.357
Nah. It's not interfering
if you're doing your job.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.317
Trust me, you don't want
to be playing catch up.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.402
Hopper's already got ten points
on a Bloody Mary.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.473
-Up, inmate.
-[gasps]

25:59.724 --> 26:02.310
Against the wall. I'm tossing your cell.

26:03.270 --> 26:06.481
-But I don't have anything--
-Get up. Now.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.576
[sighs] Fuck.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.336
This is some bullshit.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.421
[grunts]

26:46.479 --> 26:47.605
[door closes]

26:52.193 --> 26:53.486
[sighs]

27:29.564 --> 27:31.524
[breathing deeply]

27:56.091 --> 27:57.092
Hey. Hey.

28:03.139 --> 28:04.474
Is that a book?

28:07.977 --> 28:09.562
I think you could call it that,

28:09.646 --> 28:12.065
what with the pages and words
between two covers.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.150
Funny. Good so far?

28:14.734 --> 28:16.194
Did you need something?

28:17.112 --> 28:18.780
I was just saying hey.

28:20.073 --> 28:24.869
We're disability buddies, after all.
[chuckles] How's the smell?

28:25.495 --> 28:28.540
It's fine. It's a sling, not a cast.

28:28.623 --> 28:30.083
I broke my shoulder as a kid.

28:30.166 --> 28:32.794
After a few weeks
the sling started to smell

28:32.877 --> 28:35.338
like my brother Sean's
hockey jock. [scoffs]

28:35.422 --> 28:39.008
Not that I...
sniffed my brother's jock strap.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.552
Just happened to get a whiff of it

28:40.635 --> 28:43.555
while I was covering it in Tiger Balm
to burn his nuts off.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.390
Yeah, I heard you're quite the prankster.

28:45.473 --> 28:48.768
I try to keep it fun around here.
That gonna be a problem?

28:48.852 --> 28:51.271
Not for me,
but the fiancée's a little uptight.

28:51.354 --> 28:55.316
Oh, you should've seen her.
She had steam coming out of her ears.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.694
Once she got the cheese out.

28:57.777 --> 29:01.239
-You should see her ask for a manager.
-[chuckles]

29:01.322 --> 29:04.993
You got jokes. I could tell.
I'm funny, too.

29:05.618 --> 29:09.622
Yeah. Pranks are funny.
Extortion? Hmm, less so.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.512
Depends on your sense of humor.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.140
Look, I get it.
You're top dog around here.

29:27.223 --> 29:28.683
I respect that.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.269
But Piper is pretty unbearable
when she's upset,

29:31.352 --> 29:33.730
which makes my life a living hell.
[chuckles]

29:33.813 --> 29:36.316
So how about she fills
your commissary this time,

29:36.399 --> 29:38.401
and you agree to lay off her? For my sake, not hers.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.615
Normally, I'd tell you
to go fuck yourself,

29:43.698 --> 29:47.494
but lucky for you,
Mischief Day is a very special day

29:47.577 --> 29:49.204
for people with my personality type.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.080
Does that mean we have a deal?

29:51.956 --> 29:55.543
Consider it another one of my good deeds.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.296
It's important to have good karma,
you know?

29:59.380 --> 30:00.965
I'll keep that in mind.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.887
[sniffing] Mmm. Ooh.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.055
This is rotten.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.432
It's supposed to be like that.
Never heard of blue cheese?

30:09.516 --> 30:12.185
It's great in a pecan scone
or pear tartlet

30:12.268 --> 30:16.231
or stuffed in a date wrapped in bacon.
I took a cheese class once.

30:16.856 --> 30:19.234
White people go
to some weird-ass schools, man.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.527
[Gloria chuckles]

30:27.116 --> 30:28.868
[laughing]

30:31.037 --> 30:32.580
<i>Pendejas.</i>

30:32.664 --> 30:35.500
[Blanca] Psst. So, I got a plan.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.502
[Gloria] Oh, relax.
It was just a stupid prank.

30:37.585 --> 30:41.256
No, not about them, <i>boba.</i>
Ruiz is back in gen pop.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.466
I say we strike first,
before she makes her move.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.260
She knows we sold her out.

30:45.343 --> 30:48.346
And it worked. She's fucked.
So I'm good. I'm done striking.

30:48.429 --> 30:50.932
It's a miracle we didn't get extra time
after I jumped her ass.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.309
Oh, let sleeping bitches lie.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.395
Oh, that bitch don't sleep.

30:55.478 --> 30:58.648
You know she's out there coming up
with ways to take us down as we speak.

30:58.731 --> 31:01.276
Look, um, if you want
to do some stupid shit

31:01.359 --> 31:03.736
and get sent back to Ad Seg, go ahead.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.029
Nobody's stopping you.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.700
We don't gotta do nothing.
We let them bitches do it for us.

31:08.783 --> 31:12.287
We let them know she's the one who
freed the guards during the riot. Hmm?

31:12.370 --> 31:14.038
Let the rest take care of itself.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.749
[Ginger] All right.
That's it for today. Wrap it up.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.502
Faster you clean,
the faster you get out to the yard.

31:20.461 --> 31:21.671
I'm watching you, Chapman.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.182
[indistinct chatter]

31:46.279 --> 31:48.364
It's like a middle school dance out here.

31:49.157 --> 31:52.744
We're on the right side.
I hear D block is full of lesbians.

31:52.827 --> 31:56.915
At least C block has some family values.
Oh. Hey, look.

32:15.642 --> 32:18.186
We're not supposed to talk
'cause we're wearing different colors,

32:18.269 --> 32:19.437
but I wanted to say hi.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.606
How you hanging there?
I see you got rid of that limp.

32:22.273 --> 32:23.650
I took some ibuprofen.

32:25.026 --> 32:25.860
You look good.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.447
I'm far from good, trust me.
But the pain is better.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.824
That one giving you any trouble?

32:31.908 --> 32:33.451
[Dayanara] No. Mostly sleeps all day,

32:33.534 --> 32:36.120
kinda like one of those dogs
that's gonna die real soon.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.456
I told you. She's up to something.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.797
So, how's opening day treating you?

32:46.756 --> 32:50.843
A girl spat on Beth Hoefler.
You know, baby killer? She's one of mine.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.554
Nice. How many points is that again?

32:53.638 --> 32:56.808
Two. And I'm keeping my own records.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.893
Not that I doubt our new commissioner.

32:59.894 --> 33:02.021
What about you? Any action? No. Day's still young.

33:10.863 --> 33:16.077
Hey, did you see that? Chapman.
Eleven o'clock. Something's up with her.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.580
She looks pretty normal to me.
Except she keeps smelling her hands.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.708
Something's definitely up.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.794
I think I should go talk to her.
You stay here.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.088
Where else would I go?

33:29.007 --> 33:31.843
-Hey, Chapman. I saw that.
-What did I do?

33:33.970 --> 33:35.847
Oh, my God. Is that my tooth?

33:35.930 --> 33:38.391
No, it's an acrylic replica.
Yes, it's your tooth.

33:38.474 --> 33:41.310
-This is amazing.
-There's no such thing as a free lunch.

33:41.394 --> 33:45.314
You gotta give something to get something.
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.400
This isn't exactly back scratching

33:47.483 --> 33:49.694
if you're holding
a piece of my body hostage.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.947
What do you want?

33:53.573 --> 33:57.035
I want you to start something.
An altercation, preferably.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.371
With that one, in khaki.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.791
What? No.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.376
You like looking like a jack-o'lantern?

34:05.460 --> 34:07.879
Because you'll never get that fixed
while you're in here.

34:07.962 --> 34:09.756
Inmates have died waiting for fillings.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.848
Ruiz and I have a history.
It's complicated--

34:18.931 --> 34:22.101
She's the only one without a posse.
You don't want to get jumped, do you?

34:22.185 --> 34:23.603
-This is entrapment.
-[scoffs]

34:23.686 --> 34:26.773
Don't worry about it. I'll make sure
there's no fallout on you or her.

34:26.856 --> 34:30.109
And I'll break it up right away
before she gets any serious punches in.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.986
-[sighs]
-Oh...

34:32.070 --> 34:35.656
Make sure you yell something
really mean beforehand.

34:35.740 --> 34:40.495
Like, "stupid dum-dum" or something.
Just make it loud.

34:44.290 --> 34:45.958
[sighs]

34:46.042 --> 34:47.085
Fuck it. [groans]

34:52.924 --> 34:54.675
Long time no see, Chapman.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.386
[softly] I'm really sorry,
but I need my tooth.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.472
[loudly] You stupid dum-dum!

34:59.555 --> 35:00.807
-[Maria grunts]
-Whoa, whoa!

35:00.890 --> 35:03.643
Break it up! Chapman! What did I just say?

35:03.726 --> 35:07.355
That's it. Your rec time's over.
Come on. Come on.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.898
Was that a gang altercation?

35:08.981 --> 35:11.442
Told you.
I know a toxic person when I see one.

35:56.279 --> 36:00.366
Good afternoon. My name is Suzanne.
What's your name?

36:02.285 --> 36:04.036
I said, my name is Suzanne.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.205
Who's Anne?

36:06.289 --> 36:08.833
No. My name is Suzanne.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.501
I don't know any Anne.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.836
[panting]

36:12.712 --> 36:13.921
Ask them.

36:15.506 --> 36:16.716
[Suzanne] Uh...

36:23.347 --> 36:27.226
Sorry to bother you guys,
but do you know an Anne?

36:32.648 --> 36:35.943
<i>♪ I feel a draft coming in ♪</i>

36:37.361 --> 36:41.282

36:58.966 --> 37:00.134
[Frieda] Hey.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.844
The floor is lava.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.513
I knew it! [grunts]

37:06.432 --> 37:07.516
I knew it.

37:07.600 --> 37:11.312
-Psst. What's that?
-Oh.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.148
Not sure.

37:15.149 --> 37:18.986
What's the word for a bundle of sticks?
Starts with an "F."

37:19.070 --> 37:21.530
-Bring it over here.
-I can't. The floor is lava.

37:22.740 --> 37:26.327
-Mmm, whoa, whoa.
-It's okay. I'm wearing asbestos boots.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.411
Oh.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.290
Ooh, ooh. Careful. It's hot.

37:42.885 --> 37:44.804
-[Linda] Hello, Joe.
-[sighs]

37:45.471 --> 37:47.890
Nice digs. Long way from Purchasing, huh?

37:47.974 --> 37:49.350
You wanted to see me?

37:49.433 --> 37:50.434
I did.

37:51.769 --> 37:52.728
May I?

38:01.904 --> 38:04.240
-First off, I want to say how sorry--
-Save it.

38:05.074 --> 38:09.412
Okay. In that case,
I'm here to discuss Tasha Jefferson.

38:09.495 --> 38:11.038
She was one of the leaders of the riot.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.708
She negotiated
on behalf of the other inmates. I'm aware. I was there, remember?

38:19.088 --> 38:20.923
Are you aware the feds are charging her

38:21.007 --> 38:23.676
with second degree murder
for the death of Piscatella?

38:24.218 --> 38:25.970
A murder she most certainly
did not commit.

38:26.053 --> 38:28.306
I am sure that the FBI
is more than capable of determining

38:28.389 --> 38:29.598
the consequences of the riot.

38:29.682 --> 38:32.643
Come on, Linda.
We both know they don't care.

38:32.727 --> 38:35.479
They are crucifying her
to cover their ass,

38:35.563 --> 38:38.024
instead of figuring out
what actually happened down there.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.192
What do you expect me to do about it?

38:40.276 --> 38:42.445
Have MCC launch
their own separate investigation.

38:42.528 --> 38:44.739
-Mmm-hmm.
-The feds have too much on their plate.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.241
They're rushing this to get
to a verdict the press would like.

38:47.325 --> 38:51.454
Look, Joe, this isn't my department
and, quite frankly, I don't care.

38:53.372 --> 38:54.665
How can you say that?

38:54.749 --> 38:56.208
With the same moral turpitude

38:56.292 --> 38:58.961
that allowed you to leave me
rotting in Ohio for nearly a week.

38:59.045 --> 39:01.422
-Linda, I am sorry--
-Fuck you, Joe!

39:01.964 --> 39:04.675
I don't accept your bullshit apologies.

39:04.759 --> 39:07.553
Oh, and by the way,
I met your little side-piece, Natalie.

39:07.636 --> 39:10.222
She looks like a camel.
Is that your thing?

39:11.766 --> 39:12.975
I have a wide range.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.060
You're disgusting.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.896
Mmm-hmm.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.734
Like I said, there's nothing I can do
to help your friend.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.027
It's not my department.

39:23.694 --> 39:26.405
But what is my department is
overseeing personnel placement.

39:27.239 --> 39:29.200
I see you've recently
submitted an application

39:29.283 --> 39:31.077
for your old job back as warden.

39:32.536 --> 39:33.454
I did.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.790
[scoffs]

39:35.873 --> 39:39.502
Well, you're obviously incapable
of being the warden over at Litchfield.

39:39.585 --> 39:42.546
But I do have an opening
over at Missouri State Penitentiary.

39:42.630 --> 39:43.798
You could start this week.

39:43.881 --> 39:47.718
Missouri State? Missouri State is
the place where wardens go to die.

39:47.802 --> 39:51.514
The only reason there's an opening there
is the last guy committed suicide.

39:52.264 --> 39:54.350
-You're trying to bury me.
-Damn right, I am.

39:54.433 --> 39:58.312
So you can either take the job and submit
quietly or I could see you in court.

39:58.396 --> 40:02.066
-Court? Were we fucking married?
-I agreed not to file against MCC,

40:02.149 --> 40:04.568
but there is still the civil case
I could file against you

40:04.652 --> 40:06.779
for the heinous negligence
that left me in the system

40:06.862 --> 40:09.156
despite you knowing full well
that I was a civilian.

40:09.698 --> 40:11.117
You are worse than Natalie.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.452
I'll consider that a yes
to Missouri, then?

40:13.536 --> 40:14.745
And also a compliment.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.789
-Sounds like I don't have a choice.
-You don't.

40:16.872 --> 40:19.959
As you know, you will have to undergo
a full psychiatric evaluation

40:20.042 --> 40:21.377
before you return to work.

40:21.460 --> 40:24.422
Also, I have a few interview questions
we need to run through,

40:24.505 --> 40:25.923
mostly as a formality.

40:26.006 --> 40:27.216
Question number one.

40:27.299 --> 40:30.928
Can you remember a time in your life
when you kept a promise to someone?

40:31.011 --> 40:32.555
-Anyone?
-[sighs]

40:38.727 --> 40:41.105
-This is bad news.
-Yeah.

40:41.188 --> 40:44.942
Back in my day,
B block was neutral territory.

40:45.025 --> 40:47.820
I guess some of these ladies
can't kick a habit.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.614
Can I have it back now?

40:51.365 --> 40:54.785
Oh, I think it's best if I hold on to it
for safekeeping.

40:55.911 --> 40:57.037
Okay.

40:58.205 --> 41:00.416
I didn't want to do this, but...

41:00.499 --> 41:03.461
I think I'm gonna have
to invoke finders keepers.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.129
[chuckles]

41:06.589 --> 41:09.925
These are deadly weapons.

41:10.009 --> 41:11.552
Not a toy.

41:11.635 --> 41:13.512
-Strongly disagree.
-[scoffs]

41:13.596 --> 41:17.183
These are fence posts for building a fort.

41:17.266 --> 41:21.103
Why else would the ends
be sharpened? Hello?

41:21.187 --> 41:26.108
To shove in someone's ear
and puncture their brain.

41:26.859 --> 41:30.738
Or to turn their eyeballs
into shish kebabs.

41:30.821 --> 41:33.991
Or put a few holes in their windpipe.

41:34.074 --> 41:35.451
Now, trust me...

41:36.327 --> 41:39.622
I've seen it done... while I was doing it.

41:39.705 --> 41:43.334
Well, there is also the double shove
up the nose to pull out the brain.

41:43.417 --> 41:44.752
Exactly.

41:44.835 --> 41:49.131
Someone in here intends to hurt somebody,

41:49.882 --> 41:53.052
and I have a feeling that somebody is me.

41:53.135 --> 41:55.721
I hope they don't end up
in the same cell as you.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.431
That would be suspenseful.

41:58.098 --> 41:59.308
[sighs]

42:00.351 --> 42:03.479
Well, there's one way to make sure
that don't happen.

42:06.273 --> 42:07.107
You mean me?

42:07.191 --> 42:08.984
Uh, still want to be roommates?

42:09.068 --> 42:11.111
Would that make us friends?

42:12.780 --> 42:15.282
Sure. Why not?

42:15.366 --> 42:16.825
Oh!

42:19.745 --> 42:21.080
[Pennsatucky sighs]

42:21.163 --> 42:22.581
[Coates] This isn't working.

42:22.665 --> 42:25.084
-[clears throat]
-Maybe we should just keep going.

42:25.167 --> 42:28.462
We been going all day, and you promised me
we were gonna do camping things.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.464
Well, these bricks are a scam, okay?

42:30.548 --> 42:33.217
How do you call it a fire-starter
if it can't start a fire?

42:33.300 --> 42:36.345
[scoffs] They're not a scam, silly.
They won't catch. Wood can't catch fire
when it's in a stack like this.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.475
-It needs--
-I just need a minute. I got it!

42:42.977 --> 42:44.979
[mutters] Tell me how to start a fire...

42:46.939 --> 42:49.692
God! Damn it!

42:49.775 --> 42:52.194
-The fuck? Chill out!
-Shit!

42:52.278 --> 42:56.365
-Chill out? I just-- I burnt my hand!
-You're in a really fucking scary mood.

42:56.448 --> 42:57.658
I'm allowed to be stressed out.

42:57.741 --> 43:00.494
Okay? This is a very high-stress situation
that we're in.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.912
You think I don't know that?

43:01.996 --> 43:05.499
[scoffs] Last I looked,
they were looking for me.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.043
Okay? You don't need to kick shit around.

43:11.213 --> 43:13.424
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean to scare you.

43:13.507 --> 43:14.967
You're always fucking sorry.

43:15.050 --> 43:17.678
Literally.
You're sorry about something every day.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.805
Look, I know I'm not perfect, all right?

43:19.888 --> 43:21.724
But I am trying really, really hard.

43:21.807 --> 43:24.518
So maybe you could be
just a little more patient with me.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.562
Or maybe you're just wasting your time.

43:30.774 --> 43:33.485
-What do you mean?
-I don't know what I mean. I just...

43:34.361 --> 43:39.158
Just, my mom was right. She always said
that certain people have, like, um...

43:40.367 --> 43:41.660
like, patterns, you know?

43:41.744 --> 43:44.330
That... She would tell me
some people will never change,

43:44.413 --> 43:47.583
because they're just wired a certain way
and not to even bother.

43:47.666 --> 43:50.377
And you know what? Maybe she was right.
I don't know, like...

43:50.461 --> 43:53.130
Things will be easier
once we get across the border. I promise.

43:53.213 --> 43:55.924
Crossing a border doesn't make you
a different person.

43:56.675 --> 43:59.511
I am a different person, Doggett,
because of you. I'm out here in the middle of nowhere,
hiding from the cops,

44:03.307 --> 44:06.352
burning my goddamn hand
because of you, Doggett.

44:06.435 --> 44:09.021
If you told me a year ago
this is where I'd be, I would've laughed.

44:09.104 --> 44:10.939
-But here I am, right?
-[sighs]

44:12.399 --> 44:15.194
It takes work, but people can change.

44:16.070 --> 44:18.947
They just...
They got to make the decision to change

44:19.031 --> 44:21.200
and then do whatever it takes
to make it real.

44:21.867 --> 44:22.868
The way I see it,

44:22.951 --> 44:26.705
everybody's just one hard decision away
from having a whole different life.

44:28.040 --> 44:31.460
That's what this is.
This is a chance at a whole new life.

44:32.127 --> 44:34.588
-Yeah.
-I thought that's what you wanted.

44:35.381 --> 44:36.465
I'm tired.

44:37.549 --> 44:40.135
-I'm tired, too.
-Hmm.

44:40.219 --> 44:45.724
So could we just not make your specialty
schmear gem s'mores?

44:45.808 --> 44:49.311
Yeah. Actually, I got a backup plan.

44:50.729 --> 44:52.856
-[scoffs]
-Right?

44:56.735 --> 45:00.864
Yeah, how much to move
a two-bedroom to Missouri?

45:00.948 --> 45:02.449
Yes, Missouri.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.993
[man speaking indistinctly
over cell phone]

45:05.077 --> 45:06.870
What? I mean...

45:07.913 --> 45:12.501
Jesus. [stammers]
What if I get rid of some shit?

45:12.584 --> 45:14.545
How much to move a one-bedroom?

45:15.629 --> 45:18.632
Jesus Christ. You gotta be kidding me.

45:18.715 --> 45:22.594
I mean, your ad says movers,
not extortionists.

45:22.678 --> 45:24.179
Yes, I said extortion.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.432
[stammers] Never mind. Please. Never mind.

45:27.015 --> 45:28.600
-[phone beeps off]
-[sighs]

45:39.778 --> 45:41.238
Fucking miserable cunt.

45:42.614 --> 45:44.491
[cell phone ringing]

45:49.455 --> 45:50.330
Hello?

45:50.414 --> 45:53.792
[woman]<i> An inmate from Litchfield Federal</i>
<i>Prison is attempting to contact you.</i>

45:53.876 --> 45:56.462
<i>-To accept this call, please press one.</i>
-[sighs]

45:57.963 --> 45:58.964
[beeps]

46:00.382 --> 46:01.925
[Taystee] <i>I haven't heard from you.</i>

46:02.009 --> 46:02.843
Taystee?

46:02.926 --> 46:04.928
You said you were gonna see
what you could do.

46:06.555 --> 46:07.598
And I did.

46:08.223 --> 46:10.767
I met with the senior vice president
of MCC.

46:11.518 --> 46:13.103
<i>All right, what did he say?</i>

46:14.062 --> 46:15.981
And she said it wasn't her department.

46:16.064 --> 46:17.524
What the fuck does that mean?

46:17.608 --> 46:19.610
<i>It means I can't help you, Taystee.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

46:19.693 --> 46:23.280
I tried. [stammers]
I got no juice on this one.

46:23.363 --> 46:25.240
<i>There's got to be</i>
<i>something else you can do.</i>

46:25.324 --> 46:27.910
Like, help me find a good lawyer
so I can fight this thing.

46:27.993 --> 46:29.703
I don't know any good lawyers.

46:29.786 --> 46:33.040
Maybe if I did, I wouldn't have to move
to fucking Missouri.

46:33.123 --> 46:35.417
You're moving? To Missouri?

46:36.084 --> 46:37.169
It's a long story.

46:37.252 --> 46:38.629
You said you would help me.

46:38.712 --> 46:40.464
<i>I tried to help you. Repeatedly. </i>

46:40.547 --> 46:43.759
Do you remember me sitting across from you
in my boxer shorts,

46:43.842 --> 46:46.178
<i>after you locked me </i>
<i>in a shithole for two days? </i>

46:46.261 --> 46:48.722
That was me trying to help you!

46:49.264 --> 46:50.766
If you would've listened then,

46:50.849 --> 46:52.851
we wouldn't be having
this conversation right now.

46:52.935 --> 46:57.105
[sighs] So that's it, then?
You gonna let me go down like that?

46:57.189 --> 47:00.609
Look, Taystee, you clearly do not do
what other people want you to do.

47:00.692 --> 47:02.528
You do what you wanna do.

47:02.611 --> 47:04.821
<i>You say you wanna fight this?</i>
<i>Then go ahead and fight it.</i>

47:04.905 --> 47:07.241
You don't need a fancy lawyer for that.

47:07.324 --> 47:09.618
[stuttering] I'm just done. I'm done!

47:09.701 --> 47:11.036
[phone beeps off]

47:11.995 --> 47:13.121
[sighs]

47:16.208 --> 47:17.626
[sighing]

47:24.216 --> 47:26.468
[chokes and coughs]

47:50.200 --> 47:51.577
Hey. Daddy, right?

47:53.161 --> 47:54.955
I'm sorry, do I know you?

47:55.038 --> 47:57.541
[Maria] Ruiz. Just got in a few days ago.

47:57.624 --> 47:59.668
Ruiz. Ruiz.

48:00.294 --> 48:02.629
You're one of those pumpkins
from up the hill, yeah?

48:02.713 --> 48:04.965
Looks like Max gave you a warm welcome.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.259
Guards roughed us up real bad
after what happened.

48:07.342 --> 48:09.886
I got something to help with that
if you got the cash for it.

48:09.970 --> 48:13.724
No, I'm good. Actually, I was thinking,
um, that I could help you out.

48:14.766 --> 48:17.144
Why would I need help from a new fish?

48:17.227 --> 48:19.354
I heard you had some beef with C block.

48:19.438 --> 48:20.689
You hear that, huh?

48:20.772 --> 48:23.650
I swear, people always be hearing shit
around this place.

48:23.734 --> 48:24.985
No disrespect.

48:25.068 --> 48:28.530
I got my own shit to work out with some
of them if you need another player.

48:29.573 --> 48:30.991
That's really interesting.

48:31.074 --> 48:33.952
'Cause, see, what I hear is that Ruiz
is the one who turned

48:34.036 --> 48:35.954
and let the guards out
to save her own ass.

48:36.830 --> 48:39.499
Like I said, people hear shit.

48:39.583 --> 48:41.335
So thanks, but no thanks.

48:42.461 --> 48:43.670
And just between us,

48:43.754 --> 48:46.632
I think you got off lucky
fuckin' with a bunch of cookies.

48:47.257 --> 48:49.343
That shit would've happened here,

48:49.426 --> 48:53.930
we would have cut your tits off
and worn them... as tits.

48:54.014 --> 48:58.560
Good to meet you, Ruiz.
And cover that bruise up. It looks weird.

49:01.897 --> 49:05.067
-Hey, look what the cat coughed up.
-Hey.

49:05.150 --> 49:07.152
-Thought I saw the last of you, Nichols.
-No. Nah, I missed you too much.

49:09.321 --> 49:12.032
Plus, couldn't let you have
these girls to yourself.

49:12.115 --> 49:14.743
I mean, hey, what's life
without a little competition?

49:14.826 --> 49:15.952
Are you staying clean?

49:16.912 --> 49:17.913
Yes.

49:17.996 --> 49:19.247
Yeah.

49:19.331 --> 49:21.750
You still waging war on the backs
of drug-addled minions?

49:21.833 --> 49:23.418
Maybe. Maybe not.

49:23.502 --> 49:25.420
I guess you'll have to wait and see.

49:29.132 --> 49:31.093
[howling on TV]

49:31.176 --> 49:33.679
-[growling]
-[woman screaming]

49:34.846 --> 49:38.558
-[suspenseful music]
-[woman continues screaming]

49:44.690 --> 49:47.859
-What ya doin', Pipes?
-Shit. You scared me.

49:49.069 --> 49:50.237
It won't stick.

49:50.320 --> 49:53.240
-I think I need dental glue.
-Is that your tooth?

49:53.323 --> 49:56.159
Yeah. That Ginger guard
made me fight Ruiz for it.

49:56.243 --> 49:58.245
-You fought Ruiz?
-It was more like a hair-pull.

49:58.328 --> 49:59.413
It was kind of weird.

49:59.496 --> 50:02.582
It was like... the guards had a bet
or something.

50:02.666 --> 50:05.377
Well, probably. I mean,
it is Mischief Night, after all.

50:05.460 --> 50:08.130
Where were you, anyway?
You were supposed to meet me out there.

50:08.213 --> 50:10.549
I spent the holiday
celebrating with your roommate.

50:10.632 --> 50:12.426
We actually did this really funny thing

50:12.509 --> 50:14.845
where we filled some girl's Oreos
with toothpaste.

50:14.928 --> 50:16.513
She ate all of them anyway.

50:16.596 --> 50:18.432
I think she thought
they were mint-flavored.

50:18.515 --> 50:22.644
You spent the day with that evil person?

50:22.728 --> 50:25.564
Relax, Piper. I did it for you.

50:25.647 --> 50:29.693
I asked her to leave you alone
and she agreed, so... problem solved.

50:29.776 --> 50:31.194
Problem not solved.

50:31.278 --> 50:36.366
Now you are gonna owe her instead of me.
You just shifted the focus from me to you.

50:36.450 --> 50:38.660
Or maybe I made a friend
where you had an enemy.

50:38.744 --> 50:41.747
Also, if we're gonna keep fighting,
you should put in your tooth.

50:41.830 --> 50:43.331
Otherwise, I'm gonna laugh.

50:45.208 --> 50:46.918
But it won't stick. All right. Jesus.

50:53.133 --> 50:54.509
All right, come here.

50:56.887 --> 50:59.014
-Say, "Ah."
-Ah.

50:59.097 --> 51:01.975
[Suzanne] <i>Or you could shove them </i>
<i>under someone's tongue. </i>

51:02.058 --> 51:04.478
Or you could stick someone
in their belly button.

51:04.561 --> 51:08.982
Although, I have heard some people's
belly buttons are a tunnel to nowhere.

51:09.065 --> 51:11.610
And belly buttons tend to smell.

51:11.693 --> 51:14.029
And then your stick would be all smelly.

51:15.113 --> 51:17.365
There's the kidney punctures,

51:17.449 --> 51:19.826
liver puncture, spleen puncture,
all the organ punctures.

51:19.910 --> 51:24.122
[gasps] Or you could do sticky things
with the nether regions.

51:24.206 --> 51:25.999
Wait, both nether regions.

51:26.082 --> 51:29.836
I haven't thought of the nether regions.
That's a whole 'nother category.

Rough night? You and the rat pack
hit up a titty bar or something?

54:21.925 --> 54:23.468
They're gone, Nicky.

54:23.551 --> 54:24.886
Who's gone?

54:24.970 --> 54:27.347
Nutella, Briar, Julius.

54:27.430 --> 54:29.224
All of 'em. They're all gone.

54:29.307 --> 54:32.852
[Nicky] Maybe they ran away because
their names are so fucking weird.

54:32.936 --> 54:35.230
That is not funny. They're just kids.

54:35.313 --> 54:36.481
[Nicky] Mmm-hmm.

54:36.564 --> 54:39.025
What does the, uh,
rat whisperer say about it?

54:39.109 --> 54:42.862
I think she thinks
that Andrea has eaten her kids again.

54:42.946 --> 54:46.741
Mystery solved. Filicide.
That's when a parent kills their child.

54:46.825 --> 54:49.703
I know my parents are guilty of it.
Not in the literal sense, of course.

54:49.786 --> 54:53.665
But, you know, still, I would argue that
they probably have quite a lot in common

54:53.748 --> 54:55.500
with Mama Andrea Rat.

54:55.583 --> 54:56.960
[Swope] Hey, you two.

54:57.919 --> 55:00.296
-You're on mop duty with us.
-Man, come on.

55:00.380 --> 55:03.425
You really need, uh,
four people to mop one room?

55:03.508 --> 55:05.301
You questioning my cleaning strategy?

55:05.385 --> 55:07.345
Oh, no, ma'am. Cleanliness is godliness.

[Cathy] <i>Good morning, </i>

<i>Today is Halloween, </i>
<i>and you know what that means. </i>

55:13.476 --> 55:15.437
You mind just, like,
turning it down a little bit?

55:15.520 --> 55:18.273
I'm having trouble hearing
the suicidal voice in my head.

55:18.356 --> 55:22.444
Oh, that's too bad. I like Cathy.
Her talking relaxes me.

55:22.527 --> 55:25.572
You find that relaxing? Were you, um...
Were you raised by farm animals?

55:25.655 --> 55:28.742
Hey. Less talking,
more shutting the fuck up.

55:28.825 --> 55:30.243
See? He's on my side.

-Much better, thank you.
<i>-Beige sweaters. Black sweaters.</i>

55:35.665 --> 55:39.127
Her voice kinda sounds
like Nutella's, actually.

55:39.210 --> 55:42.297
-I think I can almost hear him.
-I hear something, too.

55:42.380 --> 55:44.049
[Cathy] <i>White sweaters. </i>

55:44.132 --> 55:46.176
<i>-Off-white sweaters. Brown sweaters.</i>
-[squeaking]

55:46.259 --> 55:47.552
[Lorna] Oh, my God.

55:47.635 --> 55:49.929
[gasps] Hey, Nutella!

55:50.013 --> 55:52.348
-Shh.
-Okay, last looks. Time to--

55:52.432 --> 55:55.685

-Nobody move.

55:57.228 --> 55:59.773
-Hopper. Hopper, come in.
<i>-Help me!</i>

55:59.856 --> 56:00.899
That's our cue.

56:03.359 --> 56:06.071
Lazlo! Augustine! Come here, baby.

56:06.154 --> 56:07.822
-Dump your buckets.
-No, thanks.

56:07.906 --> 56:09.282
[Lorna] Nicky, you gotta do it.

56:09.365 --> 56:11.743
Do it. Should I tell Daddy
you refused orders?

56:11.826 --> 56:12.911
[Lorna] Do it, Nicky.

56:12.994 --> 56:15.705
You don't want to be on his bad side.
Or her bad side. Whatever it is.

56:15.789 --> 56:17.540
-Fuck me. [yells]
-[Lorna] Nicky!

56:17.624 --> 56:20.043
Everyone follow me now
in an orderly fashion.

56:20.126 --> 56:21.669
At least now they are free.

56:21.753 --> 56:24.089
And they have
all the cheese they could want.

56:25.340 --> 56:27.217
-[Ginger] You hear that?
-Of course I heard it.

56:27.300 --> 56:29.469
What should we do?
Supposed to take them to their shift.

56:29.552 --> 56:31.346
Hopper's on it.
I'm taking mine to D block.

56:31.429 --> 56:32.847
Take yours to the packing warehouse.

56:32.931 --> 56:35.058
They'll let us know
when they figure out what that was.

56:35.141 --> 56:36.226
Copy that.

56:37.727 --> 56:39.854
[hissing and clicking tongue]

56:42.899 --> 56:45.151
Any idea who picked up Chatty Cathy?

56:45.235 --> 56:47.946
No idea.
I think she might be a free agent.

56:48.029 --> 56:49.239
Thank God.

56:51.658 --> 56:56.538
Okay, ladies. Get to packing
until we tell you otherwise.

56:57.372 --> 56:59.040
Let's, uh... Can we clean...

56:59.124 --> 57:01.334
Clean this. Clean those.

57:14.472 --> 57:15.598
Son of a mother!

57:35.785 --> 57:37.454
[Ginger] Everyone remain calm!

57:37.537 --> 57:39.539
Uh, the cheese has not been harmed.

57:39.622 --> 57:42.167
Uh, we'll wash it off.
Nobody saw anything.
