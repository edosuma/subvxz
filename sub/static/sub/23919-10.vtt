ANNOUNCER: The Americans.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.778
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.484
FX presents Atlanta.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.021
GLORIA:
Whoa.

00:21.055 --> 00:25.626
This is so beautiful.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.261
Wow.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.163
That's a good price.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.898
Mom, can we leave soon?

00:30.931 --> 00:32.966
I'm tired.
I was at school all day.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.669
I don't know what you gonna do
when you get a real job.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.305
You said school is my job.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.572
Boy, shut up.

00:38.606 --> 00:39.907
I'm almost done.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.942
Wow.

00:41.975 --> 00:44.612
("Give Me One Reason"
by Tracy Chapman playing)

00:44.645 --> 00:47.581
* Give me one reason
to stay here *

00:47.615 --> 00:50.551
* And I'll turn
right back around *

00:54.422 --> 00:57.625
* Give me one reason
to stay here *

00:57.658 --> 01:01.061
* And I'll turn
right back around *

01:03.731 --> 01:07.568
* Said I don't want
to leave you lonely *

01:07.601 --> 01:11.705
* You got to make me
change my mind *

01:13.741 --> 01:16.444
* Baby, I got your number *

01:16.477 --> 01:20.114
* Oh, and I know
that you got mine *

01:23.451 --> 01:24.718
* But you know
that I called you... *

01:24.752 --> 01:26.053
Mom, can I get this shirt?

01:26.086 --> 01:27.921
-This one, in my hand.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.957
Better not have
no craziness on it.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.225
No.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.427
Oh, why you had
to pick this color?

01:33.461 --> 01:35.062
This is the only one.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.330
Let me see it.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.665
* Call me anytime... *

01:37.698 --> 01:38.766
Thanks, Mom.

01:38.799 --> 01:39.900
Oh, don't thank me yet.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.135
You're gonna work for it.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.271
Go and get me a bag
of potato chips.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.639
-The kind with the owl on it.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.242
Over there, by the jeans and
the socks and the other snacks.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.278
Go on and find it, boy.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.336
GLORIA:
Earn?

02:15.369 --> 02:17.371
You better be up, in there.

02:19.039 --> 02:21.909
I am.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.845
* Here comes
the brand-new flava in ya ear *

02:24.878 --> 02:27.315
* Time for new flava
in ya ear... *

02:50.804 --> 02:52.172
EARN:
What's up?

02:52.206 --> 02:54.442
Chillin'.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.043
Cool shirt.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.111
Thanks.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.449
You do the math homework?

03:01.482 --> 03:02.950
I forgot about it.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.353
Just copy it during lunch.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.465
Hey, who did that?

03:17.498 --> 03:20.268
Huh?

03:20.301 --> 03:22.236
I said, who did that?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.841
Aw.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.618
Hey, man, I'm sorry, though.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.019
-I didn't mean to...
-Yo.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.054
You threw that yogurt
out the window?

03:41.088 --> 03:42.456
Yeah, listen, I'm sorry.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.866
DRIVER:
No moving around the bus.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.185
BOY: Every single time, you're
always like, "No, stop it."

04:12.219 --> 04:15.222
:
That doesn't even make no sense.
-You know, you know.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.592
CHRIS:
Oh, snap.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.260
Look at the nigga
with the FUBU shirt.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.363
Yo, man, let me see.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.833
Man, do I want one of these.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.868
I got to wait
till my birthday, though.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.504
MARK: Oh, Earn out here,
he trying to jump fresh.

04:30.538 --> 04:31.905
I see you.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.074
You know.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.809
MARK:
Okay. I got you.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.411
So, what-what you telling me is,

04:37.445 --> 04:40.080
y'all finna be mad at me for
the rest of the time I'm here...

04:40.113 --> 04:41.882
Hey, Earn.

04:41.915 --> 04:42.983
I like your shirt.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.418
Thanks.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.153
It's new.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.189
MARK:
Wait, wait, wait.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.824
Y'all had a sale, or something?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.660
Why both y'all
got the same shirt?

04:53.927 --> 04:56.129
CHRIS:
Oh, shit!

04:56.163 --> 04:57.365
One of y'all got a fake shirt.

04:57.398 --> 05:00.067
Look, this one has more stripes

05:00.100 --> 05:02.302
than that one,
and that one got a patch.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.905
Oh, no, y'all wearing
fake FUBU now?

05:07.808 --> 05:08.809
My shirt ain't fake.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.944
Talk to Earn.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.279
My shirt ain't fake, either.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.447
"My shirt ain't fake, either."

05:13.481 --> 05:15.749
One of y'all got a fake shirt.

05:15.783 --> 05:16.850
Let me see the tags.

05:27.495 --> 05:30.130
-Same to me.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.265
CHRIS:
I don't think he's here yet.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.734
He wasn't on the bus,
so he might come late.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.736
Definitely gonna know
which one fake.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.472
MR. HALEY:
Okay, ladies and gents.

05:38.506 --> 05:41.008
Let's take our seats.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.477
I'm Mr. Haley, and I'm subbing

05:43.511 --> 05:45.646
for Mrs. Fox's homeroom.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.481
Why your shoes so dirty?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.283
He got chicken grease
on his shoes.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.354
Please take a seat, young man.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.657
Your underarms smell like ribs.

05:59.226 --> 06:02.029
Sit down right now.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.869
I'm gonna write you up.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.337
CLASS:
Oh...

06:13.874 --> 06:15.042
Earthquake!

06:31.592 --> 06:35.195
So, do you know why
you're here today, Alfred?

06:35.228 --> 06:37.665
Racism. Not everybody's
gonna like me.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.901
Well, no, that's not it.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.135
Waleed came here today
because he believes

06:42.169 --> 06:44.271
you stole
his graphing calculator.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.173
Hmm. Racism.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.208
He did steal my calculator.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.610
I know he did.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.445
-No, I didn't.
-He's lying.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.246
I bought one from him.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.115
It was the one that got stolen.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.684
My name was already
engraved in it.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.185
Prove it, 'cause that's a lie.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.587
This is exactly
why we don't allow

06:59.620 --> 07:00.888
the buying and selling

07:00.921 --> 07:02.856
of any items
here on school property.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.858
You definitely know
that, Alfred.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.393
I've told you that
several times.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.396
Well, if that was true,

07:09.429 --> 07:11.031
then both of us are guilty.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.601
You'd have to write me
and him up.

07:13.634 --> 07:16.336
So do what you got to do.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.908
Okay. Alfred, go back to class.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.210
And if I hear about
you selling anything,

07:23.243 --> 07:25.579
I'm gonna send you to I.S.S.
Got it?

07:25.613 --> 07:27.414
I need a pass.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.585
There you go.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.300
Hey, they got snitches
up in here!

07:47.334 --> 07:48.435
-MR. WHITMAN: Alfred!

07:48.468 --> 07:50.103
I will write you up, boy.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.139
Go to class!

07:57.277 --> 07:59.412
Wait, so what's going on?

07:59.446 --> 08:02.182
Devin has the exact
same shirt as me.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.184
Well, pretty much.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.485
One of 'em's bootleg, though.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.521
-Fake.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.656
So?

08:08.689 --> 08:10.390
Your shirt looks fine to me.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.492
But if it's fake,
everybody's gonna roast me.

08:12.526 --> 08:13.861
Forever.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.763
Remember how Thomas
got his nickname?

08:15.796 --> 08:16.930
Who?

08:16.964 --> 08:19.032
Thomas Jones.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.267
Doo-doo Jones.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.135
Oh. Yeah.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.137
Well, is your shirt fake?

08:24.171 --> 08:26.940
I don't know.

08:26.974 --> 08:30.644
Doesn't seem like
a big deal to me.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.479
I've worn this shirt
twice this week.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.887
Beat your ass
with your hand-me-down overalls.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.963
Gonna be major differences

08:49.997 --> 08:51.799
between animal cells
and plant cells.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.835
The cell walls, for instance.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.237
So, when we're looking
under the microscope,

08:57.270 --> 08:59.973
we are going to locate

09:00.007 --> 09:02.375
the key differences.

09:02.409 --> 09:03.577
Denisha.

09:03.611 --> 09:06.379
Denisha, sit up.
You can't sleep here.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.682
My head hurts.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.317
MRS. BANKS:
Remember you said you were going

09:10.350 --> 09:11.885
to do some work today?

09:11.919 --> 09:13.120
DENISHA:
So?

09:13.153 --> 09:17.725
Everybody, go ahead
and break into your lab groups.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.496
Denisha, do we need to go
and talk outside?

09:23.530 --> 09:24.732
No.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.236
We talked about this
at the meeting.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.538
Are we gonna have
a good day today?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.574
I don't know. Are we?

09:43.951 --> 09:45.853
This one's a plant cell.

09:45.886 --> 09:49.222
Are you sure? I couldn't tell.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.591
There's a chloroplast in there.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.799
Hmm, I thought that was
a mitochondria.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.035
You're pretty smart, Earn.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.565
RACHAEL:
Look at this one.

10:32.599 --> 10:36.569
The thing on the right
is a vacuole, right?

10:36.603 --> 10:39.707
I think so.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.623
Last one.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.659
Yeah? Let me see.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.399
You got a thread on your shirt.

11:06.433 --> 11:10.670
Um... it's an animal cell.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.119
All done.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.885
Hey, yo, is that him?
That's him. Come on, come on.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.152
-Come on, come on.
-Oh, sh...

11:59.186 --> 12:02.055
-Hold up, hold up, hold up.
-Yo, yo, yo.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.726
Oh, shit. Look at this.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.129
Nigga, where did you get
this fake

12:09.162 --> 12:10.463
A thrift store?

12:10.497 --> 12:12.966
My shirt's not fake.
I got it at a regular store.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.037
I don't...
My mom bought it for me.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.171
BOTH:
Oh!

12:18.205 --> 12:19.472
-Come here, come here.
-Hold on.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.474
Look at him trying to hide
his fake shirt.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.877
Don't try and hide that shit
now. It's too late, nigga.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.312
My shirt's not fake.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.714
Uh, I don't know, man.
It looks fake to me.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.950
Hey, this nigga
ain't got on FUBU.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.319
-He got "FEBE."

12:32.352 --> 12:35.722
Hey! Hey, everybody!

12:35.755 --> 12:39.226
-This man got on FEBE!

12:39.259 --> 12:42.295
Like, type of nigga to wear
four-line Adidas and shit.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.555
* Excuse me, do you think that *

13:08.588 --> 13:11.324
* I might be able
to touch you? *

13:11.358 --> 13:15.062
*
-* Yay-yay *

13:15.095 --> 13:17.564
* I can tell you how I feel *

13:17.597 --> 13:20.733
* About you night and day *

13:20.767 --> 13:22.602
* How I feel about you *

13:22.635 --> 13:25.405
* No, no *

13:25.438 --> 13:29.209
* I can tell you how I feel
about you... *

13:40.820 --> 13:42.289
What's up?
You got that homework?

13:42.322 --> 13:43.924
Left it in my locker.

13:45.458 --> 13:48.661
Everyone's talking about
you and Devin's shirt.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.597
Yeah, I know.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.332
People in other grades
know about it.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.766
Well, your shirt is real,

13:53.800 --> 13:56.269
so you ain't got
nothing to worry about.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.471
Everybody's gonna roast
the hell out of Devin, though.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.408
It's gonna be bad. You can't
wear no fake shit here.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.310
Nobody knows
whose shirt is fake.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.113
Johnny's not even here.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.348
Yeah, he is. He came in late,

14:08.381 --> 14:10.984
but he was in Ms. Wells' class
with me. He's here.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.121
OLDER KID:
This fool got on FEBE, too.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.057
Hey, look, look,
look, look, man.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.327
So, tell me, whose is fake,
yours or little dude over there?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.662
Man, my dad bought this for me.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.198
All right?
I don't wear bootleg clothes.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.700
I got all the Jordans,
everyone knows that.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.003
And Earn come in here every day
looking like a bum,

14:30.037 --> 14:32.205
so y'all know his shirt is fake.
Y'all know it.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.308
My dad don't buy me
nothing fake.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.945
: Hey,
you a funny dude, man, hold on.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.512
-Hey, come here, nigga.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.248
-Come on, brah.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.816
Why you got to be like that?

14:47.887 --> 14:51.024
Ooh, Rush Hour soundtrack.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.028
:
Al.

14:55.062 --> 14:58.298
Al. Alfred.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.005
Nothing, really.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.873
Hey, you saw that Dragon Ball Z
last night?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.741
Nah, my mom won't
let me watch it anymore.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.477
Saw the black guy
with the red lips

15:10.510 --> 15:12.379
and now she says it's racist.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.782
-Oh, yeah, man, that's weird.
-Yo. You got to help me.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.217
Why, what's wrong?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.252
It's my shirt.
Somebody has the same one as me

15:19.286 --> 15:21.421
and now everybody's saying
one of us has a fake shirt.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.323
Oh, snap, man, that's you?

15:23.356 --> 15:24.724
-Nothing.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.726
-I was trying to be cool.
-Bruh.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.895
Man, is this shirt bootleg?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.363
I don't know.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.200
I got it at Marshalls,
but it was on sale.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.235
Man, that's why you can't be
buying stuff on sale.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.703
Bro, you got to get some money.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.171
He's tripping.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.840
Look, there's a hole in it.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.045
I'm serious, Al.
I need your help.

15:45.078 --> 15:48.215
I'm not cool like you.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.218
If the older kids find me,
they're gonna beat me up.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.320
Yeah, man, you're right.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.055
What should I do?
I'm freaking out.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.790
Uh, how cool is the other kid?

15:57.824 --> 16:00.460
He's pretty cool.
He always has dope clothes.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.595
His dad is, like, 30.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.863
Man, don't be acting nervous.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.133
I mean, people try
to come at you, just deny it.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.200
Confidence is the key.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.936
All right?

16:09.969 --> 16:12.639
Hold it down, cuzzo.
Heading to lunch.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.674
Okay.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.082
MRS. WILLIAMS: Make sure
you finish your packets

16:22.115 --> 16:23.750
and bring them in tomorrow.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.785
I'm going to place a bin
on my desk.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.354
I want you to put them in there.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.289
And cite your work, folks.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.325
The Internet is not a source...

16:32.359 --> 16:33.960
-All right,

16:33.993 --> 16:35.828
names at the top
of your packets.

16:35.862 --> 16:39.432
That's an easy 50 points.
Good job.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.616
Wait, Earn!

16:56.649 --> 16:58.918
Johnny? Guess who I found.
Check it out.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.120
Oh, this shit crazy.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.988
Let me see the tag.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.494
This one's fake!

17:07.527 --> 17:08.795
It says "made in Bangladesh."

17:08.828 --> 17:09.862
It should be China.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.030
I knew he was wrong as hell.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.934
Hey, yo, his shirt fake, y'all!
Yo!

17:14.967 --> 17:16.836
Hold up, hold up,
hold up, hold up, hold on.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.171
Let me see.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.546
Let me see.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.815
Man, this one the real shirt.

17:28.848 --> 17:32.385
It's supposed to say "made in
Bangladesh" on this one.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.922
Of course this fool gonna say
"made in China." He is Chinese.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.957
-Come on, man.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.193
That one the fake one.
Trust me, I know.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.664
Man, my shirt ain't fake.
It ain't.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.199
CHRIS:
Yo, this nigga homeless!

17:46.233 --> 17:48.368
Devin rockin' fake FUBU now.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.403
JOHNNY:
I'm not Chinese. I'm Filipino.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.988
Wait. Here you go, Earn.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.258
You know, that's my number,
if you want to call me.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.425
But only between 6:00 and 9:00.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.660
O-Okay, cool.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.596
-See you tomorrow, Earn.
-See ya.

18:19.732 --> 18:23.035
Yo. I can't believe this fool
tried to lie on you.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.671
Yeah, it's crazy.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.139
Yeah, 12th-graders
just found out.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.774
They're going in on this man.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.288
-Damn.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.290
Hey, FEBE, man.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.727
OLDER KID: You finna cry
or something

19:03.009 --> 19:05.645
("Passing Me By" by The Pharcyde
playing)

19:05.678 --> 19:08.381
GIRL : Band practice
will be moving to Room G today

19:08.415 --> 19:10.149
due to a leak in the ceiling.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.151
That is Room G.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.754
Just a reminder,
the book fair is this Tuesday.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.556
If you have any books
you want to donate,

19:16.589 --> 19:19.025
you can trade them
with Mr. Johnson...

19:21.461 --> 19:22.429
Spirit Week is next week.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.797
We will be doing Pajama Day,

19:24.831 --> 19:27.634
Sports, Crazy Hair,
and '80s Day...

19:50.890 --> 19:53.159
Everyone, please settle down.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.973
I came to let you all know
something very serious.

20:07.006 --> 20:10.943
Your classmate, Devin Myers,
committed suicide last night.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.615
We're not sure why,

20:15.648 --> 20:18.150
but we've heard
a couple of things.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.987
It seems Devin's parents
had just gotten divorced,

20:21.020 --> 20:23.990
and he was dealing with it
pretty hard.

20:24.023 --> 20:26.493
Now, if anybody needs to talk
about what happened,

20:26.526 --> 20:29.161
please visit Mrs. Lindell
in the counselor's office.

20:29.195 --> 20:33.065
Mrs. Banks or any other teacher
will write you a pass.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.868
Thank you, Mrs. Banks.

20:42.275 --> 20:44.644
MRS. BANKS:
I think it's good to remember

20:44.677 --> 20:47.380
that we all have

20:47.414 --> 20:50.082
personal things going on
in our life

20:50.116 --> 20:51.884
that other people may not
know about.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.522
So...

20:55.555 --> 20:57.690
-Hi, Mrs. Banks.
-Oh, hello, Denisha.

21:00.660 --> 21:04.030
MRS. BANKS:
But... let's try to be

21:04.063 --> 21:06.232
more understanding
of one another.

21:08.267 --> 21:12.204
Okay, um, turn to page 45

21:12.238 --> 21:13.540
in your books.

21:13.573 --> 21:17.043
And, uh, who wants to read?

21:17.076 --> 21:19.579
-I'll do it, Mrs. Banks.
-Okay.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.252
Whenever you're ready.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.263
Hey.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.666
You look tired.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.234
No, I'm okay.
Just a long day.

21:42.268 --> 21:45.438
Maybe you need to start going to
bed sooner and stop staying up.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.441
Hey, Earn.
-Hey, Auntie.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.077
GLORIA:
I got a call from the school.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.813
One of your classmates died.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.748
-Yeah, Devin.
-Hmm.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.350
-Kind of.

21:57.384 --> 22:00.620
That's so sad.
She seemed to think

22:00.653 --> 22:02.489
maybe some of the older boys
were messing with him.

22:02.522 --> 22:07.226
You better say something
if somebody tries harassing you.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.228
People will bully you
your whole life if you let 'em.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.830
-Yeah, they will.
-You got to stand up
for yourself.

22:10.863 --> 22:11.831
Mm-hmm, and you and your cousin

22:11.864 --> 22:14.634
got to look out for each other.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.636
You guys look out
for each other, now.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.839
Boy, get your feet
out that chair.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.273
GLORIA: You start
piano lessons tomorrow.

22:21.307 --> 22:23.876
-Yeah, I'm ready.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.845
I'm gonna lay out
a suit for you,

22:25.878 --> 22:28.180
so you'll need to add
a black belt.

22:28.214 --> 22:29.816
A suit?
Why I got to wear that?

22:29.849 --> 22:31.618
Because I said so.

22:31.651 --> 22:32.952
You want to make
a good impression.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.521
Our mother always said,

22:34.554 --> 22:36.789
"You got one chance to make
a first impression."

22:36.823 --> 22:38.290
LORRAINE:
Mm-hmm. True indeed.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.092
But it's gonna be all hot...

22:40.126 --> 22:41.360
GLORIA:
I don't care.

22:41.394 --> 22:44.030
You are a black man in America,

22:44.063 --> 22:46.866
and when you meet people,
you need to look good.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.968
Your clothes are important.

22:49.001 --> 22:52.905
That's true, Earn.
You need to wear the suit.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.210
GLORIA:
Oh, and I got you another one

22:58.244 --> 22:59.846
of those FUBU shirts.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.481
It was on sale.

23:01.514 --> 23:04.383
Don't say I never did
anything for you.
