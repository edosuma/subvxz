WEBVTT

00:06.214 --> 00:07.800
( â™ª )

00:10.051 --> 00:12.888
(Theme music on accordion)

00:20.354 --> 00:22.648
(Sizzling, lighter clicking)

00:22.731 --> 00:24.900
(Exhaling)

00:27.695 --> 00:30.071
(Ice rattling in glass)

00:30.698 --> 00:32.407
This is fucking

00:30.698 --> 00:32.407
bullshit, boys.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.535
We cannot sleep

00:32.491 --> 00:34.535
in airports

00:34.618 --> 00:35.786
and airplanes

00:34.618 --> 00:35.786
anymore

00:35.870 --> 00:37.204
'cause my back

00:35.870 --> 00:37.204
can't take it.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.455
You're fucking

00:37.287 --> 00:38.455
kidding me.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.455
We should have

00:38.539 --> 00:40.290
500 fucking dollars

00:38.539 --> 00:40.290
each right now.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.209
Yeah, well, maybe

00:40.374 --> 00:42.209
if you hadn't

00:40.374 --> 00:42.209
pulled out a handgun,

00:42.292 --> 00:44.920
we would! Did you ever

00:42.292 --> 00:44.920
think of that, Ricky?

00:42.292 --> 00:44.920
Fucking assholes.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.839
Well, the reason

00:45.004 --> 00:46.839
why I was asleep was

00:45.004 --> 00:46.839
'cause of you, man.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.298
You fucked up

00:46.922 --> 00:48.298
the hotels!

00:46.922 --> 00:48.298
This is my fault?

00:48.382 --> 00:49.758
The hotel was

00:48.382 --> 00:49.758
your fuck-up.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.758
Hey, no, no, no...

00:49.842 --> 00:51.176
Listen.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.176
We're day b...

00:49.842 --> 00:51.176
Fucking...

00:51.259 --> 00:54.013
We agreed on this

00:51.259 --> 00:54.013
together, okay?

00:51.259 --> 00:54.013
Did we?

00:54.095 --> 00:55.806
'Cause I remember

00:54.095 --> 00:55.806
Julian saying,

00:54.095 --> 00:55.806
No, no, don't...

00:55.890 --> 00:58.058
"Here's what we're

00:55.890 --> 00:58.058
doing, group."

00:55.890 --> 00:58.058
Don't even start.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.810
Don't even

00:58.141 --> 00:59.810
fucking start.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.810
Fucking bullshit.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.270
The only reason why

00:59.894 --> 01:02.270
we had any fun on

00:59.894 --> 01:02.270
this trip so far

01:02.354 --> 01:05.273
was because of me.

01:02.354 --> 01:05.273
Oh, yeah. Okay.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.609
Well, if we make money

01:05.357 --> 01:07.609
today, it's mine

01:07.693 --> 01:09.194
'cause I am recording

01:09.277 --> 01:11.613
at fucking

01:09.277 --> 01:11.613
Sun Studios tomorrow,

01:11.697 --> 01:13.824
come hell or fucking

01:11.697 --> 01:13.824
high water!

01:13.908 --> 01:16.201
We're going to be in Memphis,

01:13.908 --> 01:16.201
Tennessee tomorrow,

01:16.284 --> 01:17.870
the home of Sun Records,

01:17.953 --> 01:19.663
and I'm going to fucking

01:17.953 --> 01:19.663
record a hit song

01:19.747 --> 01:21.248
at Sun Studios,

01:21.331 --> 01:23.166
where all the legends

01:21.331 --> 01:23.166
have recorded.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.710
That's what's happening.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.710
I don't give a fuck.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.253
Ricky and Julian,

01:26.336 --> 01:28.047
they can take a big

01:26.336 --> 01:28.047
hydraulic suck on my nuts

01:28.129 --> 01:29.381
'cause that money's mine.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.050
Get in the

01:29.464 --> 01:31.050
fucking van.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.050
That's the deal.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.885
Great fucking trip

01:31.132 --> 01:32.885
so far, boys.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.469
Bubbles:

01:32.968 --> 01:34.469
I'm getting

01:32.968 --> 01:34.469
in the front...

01:34.553 --> 01:36.304
Go ahead, I don't

01:34.553 --> 01:36.304
even give a fuck.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.766
Johnny Cash

01:36.388 --> 01:38.766
wouldn't ride in

01:36.388 --> 01:38.766
the fucking back.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.393
Elvis wouldn't

01:38.849 --> 01:41.393
ride in the back.

01:41.476 --> 01:44.271
Elvis isn't even...

01:41.476 --> 01:44.271
Get the fuck in

01:41.476 --> 01:44.271
the van! Let's go!

01:45.731 --> 01:47.148
It's great that you

01:45.731 --> 01:47.148
got this dream, Bub,

01:47.232 --> 01:48.400
but just remember:

01:48.483 --> 01:50.069
this trip isn't

01:48.483 --> 01:50.069
all about you.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.570
Yeah, man.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.570
I mean, first you

01:50.151 --> 01:51.570
started to take over

01:51.653 --> 01:52.821
with all the

01:51.653 --> 01:52.821
astronaut horseshit,

01:52.905 --> 01:54.239
and now this

01:52.905 --> 01:54.239
music bullshit?

01:54.322 --> 01:55.616
Come on, man.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.616
I wasn't taking over.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.117
When you think

01:55.699 --> 01:57.117
about it...

01:57.200 --> 01:58.577
I mean, we've got to

01:57.200 --> 01:58.577
be realistic here.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.161
If I blow up as

01:58.660 --> 02:00.161
a big country star,

02:00.245 --> 02:02.330
and I could,

02:00.245 --> 02:02.330
then you guys

02:02.414 --> 02:04.332
would probably be

02:02.414 --> 02:04.332
working for me

02:02.414 --> 02:04.332
at that point,

02:04.416 --> 02:06.043
and I'd like

02:04.416 --> 02:06.043
that, but...

02:06.126 --> 02:07.711
you're going to

02:06.126 --> 02:07.711
have to change your

02:06.126 --> 02:07.711
fucking attitudes.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.296
(Scoffing)

02:07.795 --> 02:09.296
Well, you know, if we

02:07.795 --> 02:09.296
make some money today,

02:09.379 --> 02:10.547
you guys can

02:09.379 --> 02:10.547
spend your money

02:10.631 --> 02:12.215
on whatever the

02:10.631 --> 02:12.215
fuck you want,

02:12.299 --> 02:14.509
but I need some money

02:12.299 --> 02:14.509
to do what I have

02:12.299 --> 02:14.509
to do here today.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.261
Oh, maybe I want

02:14.593 --> 02:16.261
to do something

02:14.593 --> 02:16.261
too then, fuck it.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.055
What the fuck

02:16.344 --> 02:18.055
do you have to do?

02:16.344 --> 02:18.055
I don't know,

02:18.138 --> 02:19.556
but it's going to be

02:18.138 --> 02:19.556
something, something

02:18.138 --> 02:19.556
fucking awesome.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.182
You're not blowing

02:19.640 --> 02:21.182
all the fucking money.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.517
I know how this goes.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.227
Ricky and Julian

02:22.601 --> 02:24.227
spend all the money,

02:24.311 --> 02:25.562
nothing left

02:24.311 --> 02:25.562
for Bubbles.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.398
Nobody gives a fuck

02:25.646 --> 02:28.398
about Bubbles.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.192
Same story

02:28.482 --> 02:31.192
all the time.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.528
Fuck, I wish we

02:31.276 --> 02:33.528
could've stayed

02:31.276 --> 02:33.528
here last night.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.196
Look how nice

02:33.612 --> 02:35.196
this place is.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.196
I know.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.991
Look at that fucking

02:35.280 --> 02:36.991
hang-elier.

02:37.074 --> 02:40.911
What?

02:37.074 --> 02:40.911
The hanging light.

02:37.074 --> 02:40.911
It's huge.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.955
We probably would've

02:40.995 --> 02:42.955
had three rooms here...

02:43.038 --> 02:45.124
No, we would've

02:43.038 --> 02:45.124
had one little bed

02:45.206 --> 02:47.334
between the three of us.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.334
Woman:

02:45.206 --> 02:47.334
Hi there!

02:47.417 --> 02:48.752
Ricky:

02:47.417 --> 02:48.752
Now, let's see

02:47.417 --> 02:48.752
what the fuck

02:48.836 --> 02:50.169
they got us

02:48.836 --> 02:50.169
doing today.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.169
Hey, how's it going?

02:50.253 --> 02:51.672
Um, we were supposed

02:50.253 --> 02:51.672
to check in yesterday,

02:51.755 --> 02:53.090
uh, but we fucked up.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.883
But there could be

02:53.172 --> 02:54.883
a package here for us,

02:54.967 --> 02:56.510
for Ricky, Julian,

02:54.967 --> 02:56.510
and Bubbles.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.971
Okay, I'll check.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.971
It's probably

02:56.593 --> 02:58.971
from Swearnet.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.351
(Whispering)

03:02.099 --> 03:04.351
She's sexy...

03:02.099 --> 03:04.351
She's sexy.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.355
Would you like me to

03:06.687 --> 03:08.355
see if we have a room

03:08.438 --> 03:11.650
available for tonight?

03:08.438 --> 03:11.650
No, we have to

03:08.438 --> 03:11.650
go to Memphis.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.152
Playing in a big

03:11.733 --> 03:13.152
recording session.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.569
I'm a country

03:13.234 --> 03:14.569
star.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.780
No fucking way!

03:14.653 --> 03:16.780
We did it?

03:16.864 --> 03:18.490
Yeah, who's

03:16.864 --> 03:18.490
the dumbass with

03:16.864 --> 03:18.490
the handgun now,

03:18.573 --> 03:20.241
hey, Bub?

03:18.573 --> 03:20.241
You, still.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.576
How much is there?

03:21.660 --> 03:23.871
1,500 bucks.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.871
(Quietly)

03:21.660 --> 03:23.871
Yes!

03:23.954 --> 03:25.580
(Loud whisper)

03:23.954 --> 03:25.580
Holy fuck, yes!

03:25.664 --> 03:28.000
Yes! You guys

03:25.664 --> 03:28.000
split up $500,

03:28.083 --> 03:30.127
give me $1,000.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.127
That's exactly

03:28.083 --> 03:30.127
what I need.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.504
$1,000?

03:30.209 --> 03:32.504
To record tomorrow.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.297
Well, you better hope

03:32.587 --> 03:34.297
we make some money

03:32.587 --> 03:34.297
doing tasks today

03:34.381 --> 03:36.341
'cause this was

03:34.381 --> 03:36.341
supposed to go on

03:34.381 --> 03:36.341
my fucking credit card.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.218
Or did you guys

03:36.424 --> 03:38.218
forget about that?

03:36.424 --> 03:38.218
What?

03:38.301 --> 03:39.803
Fuck that. You said

03:38.301 --> 03:39.803
we could make

03:38.301 --> 03:39.803
monthly payments.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.596
That's how credit

03:39.887 --> 03:41.596
cards work, isn't it?

03:41.680 --> 03:43.306
I want some of

03:41.680 --> 03:43.306
the money to do

03:41.680 --> 03:43.306
something fun today.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.225
No, we've got to think

03:43.390 --> 03:45.225
about this, boys.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.227
Spend it wisely.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.188
The more we spend

03:47.310 --> 03:49.188
on me, the more

03:47.310 --> 03:49.188
we're going to make.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.606
What the fuck

03:50.105 --> 03:51.606
are the tasks?

03:51.690 --> 03:53.108
Okay, it says,

03:51.690 --> 03:53.108
"Go to The Joint

03:53.192 --> 03:55.694
to receive your tasks."

03:53.192 --> 03:55.694
To The Joint?

03:55.777 --> 03:57.612
The Joint.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.612
God, sounds like

03:55.777 --> 03:57.612
a fucking dispensary,

03:57.696 --> 03:59.280
and if it is,

03:57.696 --> 03:59.280
I'm getting higher

03:59.364 --> 04:01.241
than one of those

03:59.364 --> 04:01.241
fucked things

04:01.324 --> 04:03.410
that goes around

04:01.324 --> 04:03.410
the Earth with the

04:01.324 --> 04:03.410
monkeys in it.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.410
Fuck yeah!

04:03.493 --> 04:05.245
Oh my fuck,

04:03.493 --> 04:05.245
he's stupid

04:03.493 --> 04:05.245
sometimes, man.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.705
What's he talking

04:05.328 --> 04:06.705
about, monkeys?

04:08.707 --> 04:10.751
Holy fuck, boys!

04:08.707 --> 04:10.751
There it is.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.377
I'm getting fucking

04:10.834 --> 04:12.377
higher than the moon.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.879
Oh, no, you're

04:12.460 --> 04:13.879
not, Ricky.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.463
Check it out.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.549
It's barbecue!

04:15.547 --> 04:17.549
They sell barbecue!

04:17.632 --> 04:19.176
We're not buying

04:17.632 --> 04:19.176
a fucking barbecue

04:19.259 --> 04:20.761
and dragging that

04:19.259 --> 04:20.761
around with us.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.761
No, Ricky...

04:20.844 --> 04:22.596
It's a restaurant.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.596
It's not

04:20.844 --> 04:22.596
a dispensary,

04:22.679 --> 04:25.224
it's a barbecue.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.224
Oh, my fuck!

04:25.306 --> 04:28.060
Those fucking assholes

04:25.306 --> 04:28.060
are fucking with me again!

04:28.143 --> 04:29.352
Fuck, I'm

04:28.143 --> 04:29.352
excited, boys.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.812
Real New Orleans

04:29.436 --> 04:30.812
barbecue.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.147
I've never had this.

04:32.231 --> 04:33.565
One thing

04:32.231 --> 04:33.565
I'd like to know:

04:33.648 --> 04:35.192
Why did they get us

04:33.648 --> 04:35.192
to fucking meet here

04:35.275 --> 04:36.693
to pick up the task?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.693
Why?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.693
I'll tell you.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.070
'Cause of this

04:36.777 --> 04:38.070
fucking thing.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.529
Some weird challenge,

04:38.153 --> 04:39.529
I guarantee you.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.907
What?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.907
Julian:

04:39.613 --> 04:41.907
What are you

04:39.613 --> 04:41.907
talking about?

04:41.990 --> 04:44.701
It's... you know,

04:41.990 --> 04:44.701
hop the table, fucking

04:41.990 --> 04:44.701
bury that in you

04:44.785 --> 04:45.953
and then free meal,

04:44.785 --> 04:45.953
I guess.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.955
Bury that...?

04:46.036 --> 04:47.955
What?

04:48.038 --> 04:49.581
What the fuck else

04:48.038 --> 04:49.581
would it be for?

04:49.664 --> 04:51.541
Ricky, what are

04:49.664 --> 04:51.541
you talking about?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.835
Putting that up your

04:51.625 --> 04:53.835
arse for free food?

04:53.919 --> 04:55.712
Depends if you're a man

04:53.919 --> 04:55.712
or a woman, I guess.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.380
Or your mouth...

04:55.796 --> 04:57.380
Ricky, it's...

04:57.464 --> 04:59.967
Ricky, that's not

04:57.464 --> 04:59.967
going to be the

04:57.464 --> 04:59.967
fucking challenge.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.342
What are you

05:00.050 --> 05:01.342
talking about?

05:01.426 --> 05:02.719
It's for the

05:01.426 --> 05:02.719
paper towel.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.387
It's a paper towel

05:02.803 --> 05:04.387
holder, dumbass.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.807
Oh, really?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.807
It might be, I guess.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.807
That's kind of far out.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.767
You were going to

05:06.890 --> 05:08.767
drive that up your ass.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.767
I would've did it.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.727
Yeah, I know you

05:08.850 --> 05:10.727
would've did it.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.727
You're fucked.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.604
We take... You

05:10.811 --> 05:12.604
touch the table...

05:12.687 --> 05:14.355
Oh, here's the

05:12.687 --> 05:14.355
food, boys.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.357
There you go, guys.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.357
Holy fuck!

05:14.439 --> 05:16.357
Look at that!

05:16.441 --> 05:17.609
Ricky:

05:16.441 --> 05:17.609
Fuck!

05:16.441 --> 05:17.609
Thank you!

05:17.692 --> 05:19.153
Oh, my God!

05:17.692 --> 05:19.153
Enjoy!

05:19.236 --> 05:20.821
Oh, we will.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.821
Look at that, boys.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.031
That is serious.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.031
Ricky:

05:20.904 --> 05:23.031
I'm fucking starving.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.033
This doesn't make any...

05:23.115 --> 05:25.033
I'm telling you, man,

05:23.115 --> 05:25.033
Something's going on.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.534
Waitress:

05:25.117 --> 05:26.534
And I have this

05:25.117 --> 05:26.534
here for you too.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.328
Oh, yes.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.328
That's our task.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.789
Look at that, boys.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.789
I don't know that

05:28.411 --> 05:30.789
I want to eat that.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.582
(Chuckling)

05:33.875 --> 05:36.295
Okay, let's see

05:33.875 --> 05:36.295
what we got here.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.545
All right.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.175
"New Orleans tasks.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.384
"Number one:

05:41.258 --> 05:43.384

1,000 bucks.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.684
<i>What?</i>

05:48.515 --> 05:50.684
1,000 bucks?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.144
Oh, we're going to be

05:50.767 --> 05:52.144
rich. That's easy.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.728
I used to fucking

05:52.227 --> 05:53.728
pass out at cemeteries

05:53.812 --> 05:55.314
all kinds of times.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.314
That's easy.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.314
I will do that one.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.898
Yeah, we can

05:55.438 --> 05:56.898
all do it.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.483
We can have, like,

05:56.982 --> 05:58.483
a little camp-out

05:56.982 --> 05:58.483
or whatever.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.986
Done.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.986
There's an easy

05:58.566 --> 06:00.986
1,000 bucks.

"Number two: complete

amount of money."

06:09.494 --> 06:11.454
That's new.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.454
What's a Boil Up

06:09.494 --> 06:11.454
Challenge?

06:11.538 --> 06:13.540
Bubbles:

06:11.538 --> 06:13.540
All three must

06:11.538 --> 06:13.540
participate.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.917
A Boil Up Challenge,

06:13.623 --> 06:15.917
I believe, down here,

06:16.001 --> 06:18.670
is when, you know,

06:16.001 --> 06:18.670
when they bring out

06:16.001 --> 06:18.670
a great big pan of...

06:18.753 --> 06:20.839
you know, like, crawfish

06:18.753 --> 06:20.839
or shrimp or...

06:20.922 --> 06:23.091
Craw... What the fuck

06:20.922 --> 06:23.091
is a crawfish?

06:23.175 --> 06:24.634
Like, a crawfish,

06:23.175 --> 06:24.634
you know?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.303
Like, the...

06:24.718 --> 06:26.303
tail and...

06:26.385 --> 06:28.138
it's like a mini lobster,

06:26.385 --> 06:28.138
but it's cuter.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.514
(Scoffing)

06:28.222 --> 06:29.514
It's got cute

06:28.222 --> 06:29.514
little eyes.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.350
Boys, I'm not

06:29.597 --> 06:31.350
doing that one.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.559
Fuck that. I'm not

06:31.432 --> 06:32.559
eating seafood.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.102
Ricky:

06:32.642 --> 06:34.102
Where do you

06:32.642 --> 06:34.102
got to go?

06:34.186 --> 06:35.354
Julian:

06:34.186 --> 06:35.354
Well, we've got

06:34.186 --> 06:35.354
a bit of time...

06:35.436 --> 06:37.314
I'm going to a psychic.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.899
Oh, my fucking...

06:37.438 --> 06:38.899
I know.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.192
Okay, okay.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.192
Are you fucked

06:38.982 --> 06:40.192
in the head?

06:40.275 --> 06:42.027
Diss away... No,

06:40.275 --> 06:42.027
it's a real psychic.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.695
Oh!

06:42.110 --> 06:43.695
A real...

06:42.110 --> 06:43.695
Oh, it's a<i> real</i> one?

06:43.778 --> 06:45.322
Oh, a fucking

06:43.778 --> 06:45.322
real one. Oh!

06:43.778 --> 06:45.322
They're real down here.

06:45.404 --> 06:47.074
They got, like,

06:45.404 --> 06:47.074
a crystal ball and

06:45.404 --> 06:47.074
everything, man.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.951
Oh, my God,

06:47.157 --> 06:49.951
a crystal ball!

06:50.035 --> 06:52.662
There's no such thing

06:50.035 --> 06:52.662
as supernatural anything.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.122
Julian:

06:52.746 --> 06:54.122
Well, we'll find out.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.122
Ghosts...

06:54.206 --> 06:55.456
Ghosts are real.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.456
I've seen those

06:55.540 --> 06:56.917
in my own two eyes,

06:57.000 --> 06:58.752
but everything else...

06:57.000 --> 06:58.752
Ricky, you did not.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.461
Julian: What are

06:58.835 --> 07:00.461
you talking about?

06:58.835 --> 07:00.461
You were on mushrooms.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.630
There's no such thing

07:00.545 --> 07:02.630
as ghosts, man.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.630
It was real.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.008
No, it was real.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.008
If you're fucking spending

07:02.714 --> 07:05.008
a bunch of our money

07:05.092 --> 07:08.427
on some bullshit

07:05.092 --> 07:08.427
stupid psychic,

07:08.511 --> 07:11.181
you are definitely doing

07:08.511 --> 07:11.181
the Crawfish Challenge.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.892
I will do the

07:11.265 --> 07:13.892
Crawfish Challenge

07:11.265 --> 07:13.892
if I can do that.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.185
Well, then we're doing it.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.729
Ricky, why would

07:15.269 --> 07:17.729
you eat everything

07:17.812 --> 07:19.189
when you know we're

07:17.812 --> 07:19.189
going to fucking...

07:19.273 --> 07:20.565
How'd you get sauce

07:19.273 --> 07:20.565
on your forehead?

07:20.648 --> 07:22.359
What are you

07:20.648 --> 07:22.359
talking about?

07:22.442 --> 07:23.693
You got the shape

07:22.442 --> 07:23.693
of a rib

07:23.777 --> 07:26.154
right across your

07:23.777 --> 07:26.154
forehead, Ricky.

07:26.238 --> 07:29.283
(Deep sigh)

07:26.238 --> 07:29.283
Julian:

07:26.238 --> 07:29.283
Jesus Christ, Ricky.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.451
So, how big are

07:29.366 --> 07:31.451
these fucking things?

07:31.534 --> 07:34.329
They're only about

07:31.534 --> 07:34.329
a quarter the size

07:31.534 --> 07:34.329
of a lobster

07:34.413 --> 07:36.790
and I've been told that

07:34.413 --> 07:36.790
you just rip them off

07:36.873 --> 07:38.208
and it's like eating a...

07:38.292 --> 07:40.127
like a lobster-flavoured

07:38.292 --> 07:40.127
chicken wing.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.337
All right. You know, I

07:40.210 --> 07:42.337
might like these things.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.131
Last time I had

07:42.421 --> 07:44.131
a fucking lobster,

07:44.214 --> 07:45.715
I was drunk,

07:44.214 --> 07:45.715
seven years old,

07:45.799 --> 07:47.092
I puked everywhere.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.927
But maybe my taste

07:47.175 --> 07:48.927
buds matured, right?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.971
Oh, oh, fuck...

07:51.054 --> 07:52.931
What are you doing?

07:51.054 --> 07:52.931
Oh, Ricky, don't!

07:53.014 --> 07:55.309
No, things just

07:53.014 --> 07:55.309
shifting around there.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.309
I feel pretty good.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.144
I'm actually starting

07:55.392 --> 07:57.144
to feel hungry again.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.020
Boys, the smell

07:57.227 --> 07:59.020
coming out of that

07:57.227 --> 07:59.020
fucking restaurant

07:59.104 --> 08:00.272
is disgusting.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.522
It smells like

08:00.355 --> 08:01.522
your mother.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.066
Fuck off.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.066
Julian, listen, listen,

08:03.150 --> 08:05.444
do not pussy out

08:03.150 --> 08:05.444
on us now.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.404
This is a mystery

08:05.526 --> 08:07.404
amount of money.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.947
You've got to do this.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.158
Arnold Schwarzenegger

08:09.030 --> 08:11.158
eats these things.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.533
Think about it.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.533
All right.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.994
If Arnie can do it,

08:12.617 --> 08:13.994
I can fucking do it.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.703
It's all protein.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.703
I can do this.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.331
It's protein...

08:15.787 --> 08:17.331
And they're full

08:15.787 --> 08:17.331
of amino acids,

08:17.414 --> 08:18.873
which is another one

08:17.414 --> 08:18.873
of those muscle words

08:18.957 --> 08:20.167
I know you use.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.167
Oh, fuck you, man.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.418
Now you're

08:20.250 --> 08:21.418
being a dick.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.087
Bubbles:

08:22.502 --> 08:24.087
This isn't for us...

08:24.171 --> 08:26.131
Uh, y'all might

08:24.171 --> 08:26.131
want to get the fuck

08:24.171 --> 08:26.131
out of the way.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.008
Various:

08:26.214 --> 08:28.008
What? Are you serious?

08:26.214 --> 08:28.008
What the fuck is that?

08:28.091 --> 08:29.676
Man:

08:28.091 --> 08:29.676
Welcome to the

08:28.091 --> 08:29.676
Boil Up Challenge,

08:29.759 --> 08:31.052
compliments

08:29.759 --> 08:31.052
of Swearnet.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.762
Bubbles:

08:31.136 --> 08:32.762
Holy fuck!

08:32.846 --> 08:35.223
Are you fucking

08:32.846 --> 08:35.223
kidding me?

08:35.307 --> 08:36.933
Is that...

08:38.059 --> 08:40.145
We got to eat

08:38.059 --> 08:40.145
all those?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.521
Little mini

08:40.228 --> 08:41.521
lobsters, look.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.856
(In high-pitched voice)

08:41.604 --> 08:42.856
"Hello, Julian."

08:42.939 --> 08:44.065
Fuck.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.065
"Hi.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.692
I'm a mini lobster."

08:45.775 --> 08:47.527
This is fucked.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.527
Bubbles:

08:45.775 --> 08:47.527
So, here,

08:47.610 --> 08:49.863
if they're like lobsters,

08:47.610 --> 08:49.863
all you'll do...

08:49.946 --> 08:51.490
you'll fucking

08:49.946 --> 08:51.490
pinch that off.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.325
There you go. Look,

08:51.572 --> 08:53.325
he's got a little tail.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.993
Oh, I can't

08:53.408 --> 08:54.993
do this, man.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.870
Yes, you can,

08:55.076 --> 08:56.870
Julian.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.870
No, I can't.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.539
Look, I think, as

08:56.953 --> 08:59.539
long as you eat one,

08:59.622 --> 09:01.375
then that's going to

08:59.622 --> 09:01.375
mean you participated.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.834
Yeah, man, just eat one,

09:01.458 --> 09:02.834
I'll eat the rest of them.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.461
Bubbles:

09:02.917 --> 09:04.461
Open. I just kind

09:02.917 --> 09:04.461
of want to look

09:04.544 --> 09:06.213
in your teeth

09:04.544 --> 09:06.213
for a second

09:04.544 --> 09:06.213
I can't do it, m...

09:06.296 --> 09:08.131
(Gagging)

09:06.296 --> 09:08.131
They taste like

09:06.296 --> 09:08.131
salami a little bit.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.633
(Retching)

09:08.215 --> 09:10.633
Bubbles:

09:08.215 --> 09:10.633
Come on, Julian,

09:08.215 --> 09:10.633
hold on to it!

09:10.717 --> 09:12.677
Julian acts like

09:10.717 --> 09:12.677
this big fucking

09:12.760 --> 09:15.180
I-can-do-anything-in-

09:12.760 --> 09:15.180
the-world muscle man,

09:15.263 --> 09:17.974
and you put one tiny little

09:15.263 --> 09:17.974
piece of seafood in his mouth

09:18.058 --> 09:20.768
and he's puking like fucking

09:18.058 --> 09:20.768
Randy after he ate kale.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.562
Bubbles:

09:20.852 --> 09:22.562
Boys, hold on to it!

09:20.852 --> 09:22.562
(Coughing)

09:22.645 --> 09:24.523
Hold on to it!

09:22.645 --> 09:24.523
No, no!

09:24.647 --> 09:26.024
Ricky...

09:24.647 --> 09:26.024
(Vomiting)

09:24.647 --> 09:26.024
Ricky,

09:26.107 --> 09:28.068
don't start

09:26.107 --> 09:28.068
this again.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.068
I can't do this!

09:28.151 --> 09:30.028
I can't

09:28.151 --> 09:30.028
fucking do it.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.028
Hey, just hold up.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.280
Aww, you got the crew

09:30.111 --> 09:32.280
puking, for fuck's sake!

09:30.111 --> 09:32.280
(Retching)

09:32.364 --> 09:34.324
Julian... Ricky! Ricky!

09:34.408 --> 09:36.617
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.617
Various:

09:34.408 --> 09:36.617
(Vomiting, coughing)

09:36.701 --> 09:39.496
No... Oh, fuck.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.496
She's out of control here.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.998
You caused a fucking

09:39.579 --> 09:41.998
chain reaction.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.998
Guys, guys, guys!

09:42.082 --> 09:43.666
You can't be throwing up

09:42.082 --> 09:43.666
at my bar.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.502
It's bad for business.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.502
You got to get the fuck out.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.712
I'm sorry about this.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.712
You got to go.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.712
You just got to go.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.589
It's not my fault!

09:47.795 --> 09:49.589
Ricky:

09:47.795 --> 09:49.589
It is your

09:47.795 --> 09:49.589
fucking fault!

09:49.672 --> 09:51.132
It's not my fucking

09:49.672 --> 09:51.132
fault, you asshole!

09:51.216 --> 09:53.093
It's your

09:51.216 --> 09:53.093
fucking fault!

09:51.216 --> 09:53.093
Go fuck yourself!

09:53.176 --> 09:54.511
I don't like seafood!

09:54.594 --> 09:57.264
I didn't take

09:54.594 --> 09:57.264
the shit vein out.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.264
I'm sorry.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.433
How much money's that?

09:59.516 --> 10:01.309
How much is that?

09:59.516 --> 10:01.309
(Indistinct)

10:01.393 --> 10:02.936
400.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.936
(Indistinct muttering)

10:03.019 --> 10:04.396
I had to pay 100

10:04.479 --> 10:06.481
just to not have them

10:04.479 --> 10:06.481
call the fucking police

10:06.565 --> 10:08.483
'cause of you.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.483
And this is my

10:06.565 --> 10:08.483
fucking fault?

10:08.567 --> 10:10.402
Well, let's even it up.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.402
I<i> told</i> you I don't

10:08.567 --> 10:10.402
like seafood

10:10.485 --> 10:12.028
and I was going

10:10.485 --> 10:12.028
to puke, didn't I?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.821
Did I say that?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.821
Let's even it up.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.115
Oh, you know what?

10:13.905 --> 10:15.115
I guarantee you

10:15.198 --> 10:16.575
Swearnet knew that

10:15.198 --> 10:16.575
I don't like seafood

10:16.657 --> 10:18.034
and they did this

10:16.657 --> 10:18.034
to fuck us up.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.994
This is not

10:18.118 --> 10:19.994
my fault!

10:20.078 --> 10:22.830
Well, I'm just saying,

10:20.078 --> 10:22.830
I'm out 100 bucks now

10:22.914 --> 10:25.166
and we better get this

10:22.914 --> 10:25.166
task money figured out

10:25.250 --> 10:27.252
because if I don't

10:25.250 --> 10:27.252
have enough to

10:25.250 --> 10:27.252
record in Memphis,

10:27.335 --> 10:28.795
I don't know what's

10:27.335 --> 10:28.795
going to happen,

10:28.878 --> 10:30.464
but it's not

10:28.878 --> 10:30.464
going to be good.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.464
You fucking...

10:30.547 --> 10:32.048
Oh, what? You're

10:30.547 --> 10:32.048
not going to be

10:30.547 --> 10:32.048
our friend anymore?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.633
Is that where you're

10:32.132 --> 10:33.633
going to go with this?

10:33.716 --> 10:35.302
Huh? Is that where

10:33.716 --> 10:35.302
you're going to go?

10:33.716 --> 10:35.302
Maybe I won't.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.471
Maybe I won't.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.471
I'm just saying.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.473
I'm just fucking saying,

10:37.554 --> 10:39.473
when I'm rich and famous,

10:39.556 --> 10:40.974
making fucking bank,

10:41.057 --> 10:42.809
and you're not working

10:41.057 --> 10:42.809
for me all of the sudden,

10:42.892 --> 10:44.519
you're going

10:42.892 --> 10:44.519
to regret this.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.519
Believe me.

10:44.603 --> 10:46.104
Is that right?

10:44.603 --> 10:46.104
Listen...

10:44.603 --> 10:46.104
Believe me.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.731
Listen, I fucking puked

10:46.187 --> 10:48.731
for you today, okay?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.192
Oh, you did that for me,

10:48.815 --> 10:51.192
did you?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.192
You know how much I

10:48.815 --> 10:51.192
wanted to do that?

10:51.276 --> 10:52.902
Do you know how much

10:51.276 --> 10:52.902
I wanted to puke today?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.238
I didn't!

10:52.986 --> 10:55.238
I did it for you, man.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.324
Look, I know you

10:55.322 --> 10:57.324
tried your best.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.033
I'm sorry,

10:57.407 --> 10:59.033
I'm just...

10:59.117 --> 11:01.411
It's fucking high

10:59.117 --> 11:01.411
stakes here, okay?

11:01.495 --> 11:02.662
I'm sorry.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.081
Deedle, deedle.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.081
All right.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.416
Okay. All right.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.416
You know what?

11:06.500 --> 11:07.917
I'm going to be gone

11:06.500 --> 11:07.917
for a little while.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.836
I'll meet you guys

11:08.001 --> 11:09.836
back at the cemetery

11:09.919 --> 11:12.172
at 7:30.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.172
You good?

11:12.255 --> 11:13.714
Yeah, I'm good.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.714
Fuck you.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.175
Are you good?

11:15.258 --> 11:16.759
All right.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.261
Don't be dissing me

11:16.843 --> 11:18.261
when I'm gone.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.888
I'm good, man.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.888
We won't.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.807
See you later,

11:20.972 --> 11:22.807
crystal ball.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.518
(Cackling)

11:24.601 --> 11:26.727
He asked me not to

11:24.601 --> 11:26.727
and then I did!

11:26.811 --> 11:28.396
That was

11:26.811 --> 11:28.396
a good one, man.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.106
(Awkward chuckling)

11:30.190 --> 11:31.941
Aww, fuck.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.776
Crabs are the most annoying

11:32.025 --> 11:33.776
thing you could ever have

11:33.860 --> 11:35.694
crawling around your cock,

11:33.860 --> 11:35.694
aren't you, little assholes?

11:35.778 --> 11:37.405
Little legs fucking itchy,

11:35.778 --> 11:37.405
and little pinchers

11:37.489 --> 11:39.324
trying to fucking

11:37.489 --> 11:39.324
pinch at your bag.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.741
Well, guess what?

11:39.407 --> 11:40.741
You think you're

11:39.407 --> 11:40.741
smarter than me?

11:40.825 --> 11:42.410
You're not!

11:40.825 --> 11:42.410
One way or the other,

11:42.494 --> 11:44.829
you're coming off

11:42.494 --> 11:44.829
my fucking body today.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.080
Fuckers!

11:46.164 --> 11:47.832
I got to deal with

11:46.164 --> 11:47.832
these fucking crabs.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.584
They're driving

11:47.915 --> 11:49.584
me nuts. We're going

11:47.915 --> 11:49.584
go to the store,

11:49.668 --> 11:51.169
I'm going to get

11:49.668 --> 11:51.169
a blow torch...

11:49.668 --> 11:51.169
you can hold it...

11:51.252 --> 11:52.504
burn the fuckers

11:51.252 --> 11:52.504
right off me.

11:52.587 --> 11:53.921
I'm going to do this.

11:52.587 --> 11:53.921
A blow torch?

11:52.587 --> 11:53.921
Yes!

11:54.005 --> 11:55.340
Think about that.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.633
A wiener roast is what

11:55.423 --> 11:56.633
you're going to have.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.092
Well, it'll kill

11:56.715 --> 11:58.092
them, won't it?

11:58.176 --> 11:59.718
Yeah, but it'll...

11:59.802 --> 12:01.762
probably burn your wiener

11:59.802 --> 12:01.762
right off your body.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.181
Well, it'll grow back.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.807
No, Ricky,

12:03.264 --> 12:04.807
for the record,

12:04.891 --> 12:07.018
it will not grow back.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.354
You can't do that,

12:07.101 --> 12:09.354
for fuck's sakes.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.605
You need to see

12:09.437 --> 12:10.605
a doctor.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.315
That's what

12:10.689 --> 12:12.315
you need to do.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.192
You're going to let

12:12.399 --> 12:14.192
me spend money on

12:12.399 --> 12:14.192
a fucking doctor

12:14.275 --> 12:15.860
Well...

12:14.275 --> 12:15.860
after complaining to

12:14.275 --> 12:15.860
Julian and everybody else

12:15.943 --> 12:17.111
about spending money?

12:15.943 --> 12:17.111
This is...

12:17.195 --> 12:18.905
this is pretty much

12:17.195 --> 12:18.905
a medical emergency.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.115
At this point, they're

12:18.988 --> 12:21.115
taking over your body.

12:21.199 --> 12:24.869
They're probably

12:21.199 --> 12:24.869
expanding southward

12:21.199 --> 12:24.869
and northward.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.913
You need to see

12:24.952 --> 12:26.913
a fucking doctor.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.665
Let's just go

12:26.996 --> 12:28.665
to a hospital.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.665
Well, you know what?

12:28.747 --> 12:30.041
I need to find some

12:28.747 --> 12:30.041
fucking smokes.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.792
If I can get high

12:30.124 --> 12:31.792
right now...

12:31.876 --> 12:33.794
maybe I'll get high

12:31.876 --> 12:33.794
enough, the fucking

12:31.876 --> 12:33.794
things will die.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.338
You think if you

12:33.878 --> 12:35.338
get high enough,

12:35.422 --> 12:38.466
the crabs are just going

12:35.422 --> 12:38.466
to drop to their death?

12:38.550 --> 12:39.718
May as well find out.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.969
Ricky... oh, my God.

12:42.053 --> 12:45.682
Let's go to

12:42.053 --> 12:45.682
a hospital.

12:45.764 --> 12:47.766
Hey, how's it going?

12:45.764 --> 12:47.766
What's up, dude?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.102
Do you guys...

12:47.850 --> 12:49.102
I like the shirt.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.562
Thank you. You don't

12:49.185 --> 12:50.562
have any smoke

12:50.645 --> 12:52.063
or anything like

12:50.645 --> 12:52.063
that, do you?

12:50.645 --> 12:52.063
No, man.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.772
We're trying to

12:52.146 --> 12:53.772
get hooked up too.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.442
Fuck!

12:53.856 --> 12:55.442
All right, well,

12:55.525 --> 12:56.984
do you know where

12:55.525 --> 12:56.984
there's a good doctor

12:57.068 --> 12:59.195
in this fucking city

12:57.068 --> 12:59.195
that can take

12:57.068 --> 12:59.195
care of things?

12:59.279 --> 13:00.614
I've got some

12:59.279 --> 13:00.614
shit going on.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.614
It's bad.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.073
What kind of shit

13:00.697 --> 13:02.073
you got going on?

13:02.156 --> 13:03.491
Just... I got

13:02.156 --> 13:03.491
shit going on

13:03.575 --> 13:05.535
and things walking

13:03.575 --> 13:05.535
around and trying to...

13:05.619 --> 13:07.579
Yeah, it's... it's

13:05.619 --> 13:07.579
not a good thing.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.248
Fuck, dude.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.248
I know.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.248
Yeah.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.958
Well, uh,

13:10.331 --> 13:11.958
two blocks down

13:12.041 --> 13:13.418
on the left,

13:12.041 --> 13:13.418
the green doors,

13:13.501 --> 13:14.835
whatever you

13:13.501 --> 13:14.835
got going on,

13:14.919 --> 13:16.170
they can fix it.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.172
Really?

13:16.254 --> 13:18.172
So, it's a doctor?

13:18.256 --> 13:20.592
Yeah. Best doctor

13:18.256 --> 13:20.592
in the city.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.302
Awesome.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.302
Okay.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.302
Time to die,

13:22.385 --> 13:24.429
you little fuck faces!

13:22.385 --> 13:24.429
Ricky...!

13:25.888 --> 13:27.223
Woman:

13:25.888 --> 13:27.223
Have you ever had

13:25.888 --> 13:27.223
a reading before?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.517
Julian:

13:27.307 --> 13:29.517
Yeah, like, I called

13:27.307 --> 13:29.517
a phone psychic.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.645
I know they're... they're

13:29.601 --> 13:31.645
not real and everything.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.230
You guys are real.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.230
This is, you know, this

13:31.728 --> 13:34.230
is what I wanted to...

13:34.314 --> 13:36.232
I want the real deal.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.276
Woman:

13:36.316 --> 13:38.276
Okay. I... I just

13:36.316 --> 13:38.276
want to make sure

13:38.359 --> 13:39.778
because, depending

13:38.359 --> 13:39.778
on what comes up,

13:39.860 --> 13:41.237
you know, it can

13:39.860 --> 13:41.237
really impact

13:41.321 --> 13:42.905
the way you live

13:41.321 --> 13:42.905
your life afterwards.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.616
Yeah. No, I totally

13:42.989 --> 13:44.616
want to hear the...

13:44.699 --> 13:46.159
you know,

13:44.699 --> 13:46.159
what's going on.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.619
That's it, that's

13:46.242 --> 13:47.619
what I'm paying for.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.497
(Whispering)

13:49.120 --> 13:50.497
Ricky, let's just go.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.956
This isn't what

13:50.580 --> 13:51.956
I thought it was.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.956
No, no,

13:52.039 --> 13:53.583
she said to come right

13:52.039 --> 13:53.583
to the fucking back.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.251
Ricky, this is

13:53.667 --> 13:55.251
not a hospital,

13:55.335 --> 13:57.295
like I was picturing.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.295
How the fuck do

13:55.335 --> 13:57.295
you get in here?

13:57.378 --> 13:59.046
Let's just go.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.298
Fuck's sakes.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.675
Ricky!

14:01.758 --> 14:03.176
Oh, my God.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.843
Ricky, it's just

14:03.259 --> 14:04.843
a fucking curtain.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.554
You just do that.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.139
Oh.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.139
Woman:

14:06.638 --> 14:08.139
Good day, gentlemen.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.057
Hey, how the fuck

14:08.222 --> 14:10.057
are you doing?

14:10.141 --> 14:12.018
Uh, good.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.018
Are you the doc?

14:12.101 --> 14:13.936
Yes,

14:12.101 --> 14:13.936
that would be me.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.936
Awesome.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.980
Well, let's just

14:14.020 --> 14:15.980
define "doc" now.

14:16.063 --> 14:19.526
You don't have a medical

14:16.063 --> 14:19.526
licence, correct?

14:19.609 --> 14:22.069
Look, I've got a major,

14:19.609 --> 14:22.069
major situation going on.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.613
I hope you can help

14:22.153 --> 14:23.613
me deal with it.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.156
I'll pay you

14:23.697 --> 14:25.156
fucking cash.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.491
Go on.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.075
(Sigh)

14:28.785 --> 14:29.952
I've got cock crabs

14:30.036 --> 14:31.412
and they're fucking

14:30.036 --> 14:31.412
out of control.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.247
I can't get rid of

14:31.496 --> 14:33.247
the little bastards.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.082
Like, is there some kind of

14:33.331 --> 14:35.082
a cream you could make up

14:35.166 --> 14:36.751
or what do you do to

14:35.166 --> 14:36.751
deal with that shit?

14:36.835 --> 14:38.837
We certainly

14:36.835 --> 14:38.837
don't use any cream

14:38.919 --> 14:40.213
or anything else.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.756
We have no

14:40.296 --> 14:41.756
need for it.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.425
We deal with buggers

14:41.840 --> 14:44.425
all the time.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.927
After all, you are

14:44.509 --> 14:46.927
in New Orleans.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.806
I can, uh, handle

14:47.011 --> 14:49.806
that little

14:47.011 --> 14:49.806
problem for you

14:49.889 --> 14:51.725
once and for all

14:49.889 --> 14:51.725
for $120.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.561
Pff! Done! 120 bucks?

14:51.808 --> 14:54.561
Yeah, done.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.561
Ricky!

14:54.644 --> 14:57.021
Ricky...

14:54.644 --> 14:57.021
What?

14:54.644 --> 14:57.021
120 bucks?

14:57.104 --> 14:58.981
That's a good deal!

14:59.065 --> 15:00.358
Oh, my God.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.358
Woman:

14:59.065 --> 15:00.358
Let me see

14:59.065 --> 15:00.358
your problem.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.609
(Sigh)

15:03.653 --> 15:05.112
You're just going

15:03.653 --> 15:05.112
to pull your bird

15:05.196 --> 15:06.656
right out, are you,

15:05.196 --> 15:06.656
in here?

15:06.740 --> 15:08.199
Just let me see

15:06.740 --> 15:08.199
your problem.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.199
She's a doctor.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.535
She's a do...

15:08.282 --> 15:10.535
Oh, yeah, there

15:08.282 --> 15:10.535
it is, yeah.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.246
Oh. You do have

15:10.618 --> 15:13.246
an extreme case,

15:10.618 --> 15:13.246
don't you?

15:13.329 --> 15:15.164
Yeah, it's fucking bad,

15:13.329 --> 15:15.164
like I was saying.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.834
Woman:

15:15.248 --> 15:17.834
Don't worry.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.834
Look at them all.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.254
When you leave here,

15:17.917 --> 15:21.254
in a few hours,

15:21.337 --> 15:25.258
all those penis predators

15:21.337 --> 15:25.258
will have vacated.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.967
They'll be gone...

15:25.341 --> 15:26.967
You are amazing.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.137
I love you.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.137
...never to

15:27.051 --> 15:30.137
return again.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.599
They'll be gone.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.599
Oh, yeah,

15:30.221 --> 15:32.599
here we go.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.100
This is going to

15:32.682 --> 15:34.100
be interesting.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.185
Make them go!

15:36.269 --> 15:37.687
Fuck, yeah.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.687
Make them go!

15:37.771 --> 15:39.272
You better move.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.272
Fuck, yeah!

15:39.355 --> 15:41.023
You better

15:39.355 --> 15:41.023
move aside.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.023
Oh, yeah, no, God.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.609
I don't want to get

15:41.107 --> 15:42.609
hit with your rays.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.402
Banish them!

15:44.485 --> 15:45.904
Banish them...

15:44.485 --> 15:45.904
(Whispering)

15:44.485 --> 15:45.904
Are you fucking

15:44.485 --> 15:45.904
getting this?

15:45.986 --> 15:48.573
...almighty cleansing.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.824
Say bye-bye.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.200
Banish them!

15:51.284 --> 15:52.744
Ahh...

15:51.284 --> 15:52.744
(Exhaling)

15:52.827 --> 15:55.288
<i>ahh...</i>

15:52.827 --> 15:55.288
I actually felt

15:52.827 --> 15:55.288
something there.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.623
Ahhhh!

15:55.371 --> 15:56.623
Bubbles:

15:55.371 --> 15:56.623
Ricky...

15:56.706 --> 15:58.541
Oh...!

15:58.625 --> 15:59.793
You okay, doc?

15:59.876 --> 16:01.461
(Gasping)

15:59.876 --> 16:01.461
I'm tired.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.129
Ah...

16:01.544 --> 16:03.129
(Mouthing silently)

16:01.544 --> 16:03.129
Oh, my fuck.

16:03.212 --> 16:06.382
So, the first thing that

16:03.212 --> 16:06.382
comes up with this card,

16:06.466 --> 16:08.384
um, it just indicates

16:06.466 --> 16:08.384
some health issues,

16:08.468 --> 16:10.678
you know, likely

16:08.468 --> 16:10.678
surrounding the liver,

16:10.762 --> 16:12.764
uh, you know...

16:12.847 --> 16:15.015
Things happen,

16:12.847 --> 16:15.015
okay?

16:15.099 --> 16:17.101
Oh, my... hmm.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.312
Uh, you know,

16:17.184 --> 16:19.312
lots of ladies

16:19.395 --> 16:20.730
coming in and out.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.775
Uh, probably

16:20.814 --> 16:23.775
won't stay, okay?

16:23.858 --> 16:25.902
Um, but that's neither

16:23.858 --> 16:25.902
here nor there.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.321
Let me just see

16:25.985 --> 16:28.321
what else comes up.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.574
You know, I just...

16:31.658 --> 16:33.827
I-I don't see... ooh.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.328
I don't think you're

16:33.910 --> 16:35.328
going to get married.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.498
I mean, I... I don't

16:35.411 --> 16:38.498
see any kids here.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.667
Um...

16:40.750 --> 16:42.543
And... and this is

16:40.750 --> 16:42.543
basically an indication

16:42.627 --> 16:44.712
of, like, living

16:42.627 --> 16:44.712
every day that you can

16:44.796 --> 16:46.506
till its

16:44.796 --> 16:46.506
fullest, okay?

16:46.589 --> 16:48.132
Um, the journey

16:46.589 --> 16:48.132
is oftentimes

16:48.215 --> 16:50.384
just more important

16:48.215 --> 16:50.384
than the end.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.345
It's not that spooky.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.140
Ricky, how many people

16:54.138 --> 16:56.140
are dead in there?

16:56.223 --> 16:57.934
I don't know, man.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.934
How many you think?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.644
All of them.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.644
(Wheezy laughter)

16:59.727 --> 17:01.103
Well, maybe not

16:59.727 --> 17:01.103
all of them.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.647
Some of the undead.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.647
This kind of cemetery,

17:02.730 --> 17:04.440
they fucking crawl

17:02.730 --> 17:04.440
right out of the

17:02.730 --> 17:04.440
goddamn graves.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.776
I don't like

17:04.524 --> 17:06.776
this place.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.776
What?

17:06.860 --> 17:08.736
Why do people spend

17:06.860 --> 17:08.736
so much goddamn

17:06.860 --> 17:08.736
money on death?

17:08.820 --> 17:10.780
It's stupid.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.780
You're dead!

17:10.864 --> 17:13.073
I know, it's...

17:10.864 --> 17:13.073
pretty dumb.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.492
It's just a cemetery.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.203
It's just, like,

17:14.575 --> 17:17.203
nothing to

17:14.575 --> 17:17.203
worry about.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.038
Well, hopefully,

17:17.286 --> 17:19.038
as long as we don't

17:17.286 --> 17:19.038
fuck with them

17:19.121 --> 17:21.123
and piss them off,

17:19.121 --> 17:21.123
they shouldn't

17:19.121 --> 17:21.123
fuck with us.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.751
Who?

17:21.207 --> 17:23.751
Well, the ghosts and

17:21.207 --> 17:23.751
the zombies and shit.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.296
Ricky...

17:24.961 --> 17:27.296
Where the fuck

17:24.961 --> 17:27.296
is Jul...

17:27.380 --> 17:28.631
It's 7:55!

17:30.424 --> 17:32.134
Do you guys know

17:30.424 --> 17:32.134
where Julian is?

17:32.218 --> 17:33.803
Cameraman:

17:32.218 --> 17:33.803
I doubt he's

17:32.218 --> 17:33.803
going to show up.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.638
He was really fucked

17:33.887 --> 17:35.638
up after he left

17:33.887 --> 17:35.638
the fortune teller.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.390
Said he was going

17:35.722 --> 17:37.390
to go to the bar

17:37.473 --> 17:39.767
and get fucking

17:37.473 --> 17:39.767
wasted.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.767
What the fuck

17:37.473 --> 17:39.767
happened?

17:39.851 --> 17:42.061
Cameraman: It wasn't good.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.061
Found out he was

17:39.851 --> 17:42.061
going to die and shit.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.897
Oh, my fuck.

17:43.980 --> 17:47.191
See, this is why

17:43.980 --> 17:47.191
you should not go

17:43.980 --> 17:47.191
to those whack jobs.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.943
They just prey on

17:47.274 --> 17:48.943
dummies like him.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.904
Now he's going to

17:49.027 --> 17:50.904
be all fucked up.

17:51.863 --> 17:53.531
(Sigh)

17:51.863 --> 17:53.531
Poor bastard.

17:51.863 --> 17:53.531
I better go

17:51.863 --> 17:53.531
find him, man,

17:53.614 --> 17:55.033
make sure he's all

17:53.614 --> 17:55.033
right. You okay here?

17:55.115 --> 17:58.118
No, Ricky, I should

17:55.115 --> 17:58.118
actually go find Julian.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.454
I mean, I'm way better

17:58.202 --> 18:00.454
at talking to him

18:00.538 --> 18:01.831
when he's in that state.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.042
No, you should

18:02.248 --> 18:04.042
stay here in case

18:02.248 --> 18:04.042
things get fucked up.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.044
Make your $1,000

18:04.124 --> 18:06.044
for recording

18:04.124 --> 18:06.044
tomorrow, man, okay?

18:06.126 --> 18:07.921
No, Ricky, look,

18:06.126 --> 18:07.921
I appreciate that,

18:08.004 --> 18:10.006
but think about it.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.006
I'm way better

18:10.089 --> 18:11.674
at rationalizing

18:10.089 --> 18:11.674
with Julian,

18:11.758 --> 18:13.175
so why don't you stay here?

18:13.259 --> 18:15.177
I'll go into the

18:13.259 --> 18:15.177
populated area

18:15.261 --> 18:16.804
and then

18:15.261 --> 18:16.804
it'll be fine.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.098
I'll come back

18:16.888 --> 18:19.098
here in a bit.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.098
Bubs, I got this.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.267
I'm not going

18:19.181 --> 18:21.267
to let you down,

18:19.181 --> 18:21.267
man, all right?

18:21.350 --> 18:22.769
Besides, you don't

18:21.350 --> 18:22.769
believe in any of that

18:21.350 --> 18:22.769
super-unnatural shit.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.228
This place scares

18:22.852 --> 18:24.228
the fuck out of me.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.730
I could never spend the

18:24.311 --> 18:25.730
night here by myself.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.482
What?

18:25.813 --> 18:28.482
Yeah, look at this

18:25.813 --> 18:28.482
fucking place.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.443
Just get a stick,

18:28.566 --> 18:30.443
though. Anything

18:28.566 --> 18:30.443
comes at you,

18:30.526 --> 18:32.361
shove it right through

18:30.526 --> 18:32.361
its fucking eye

18:30.526 --> 18:32.361
sockets, all right?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.196
Good luck, buddy.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.196
Ricky...

18:34.280 --> 18:35.949
Ricky. Fuck!

18:37.241 --> 18:39.452
Ohhh, this is lovely.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.703
This is lovely.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.872
Bubbles is here by himself.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.541
Two minutes to 8:00.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.210
Okay, I'm going in.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.421
You guys should come

18:48.294 --> 18:50.421
with me just so it...

18:50.504 --> 18:51.965
they know I was in here.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.008
Let's go, all of us.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.635
You and you.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.635
Let's go.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.430
This is not that scary.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.140
Why would I be

18:59.513 --> 19:01.140
scared of this?

19:01.223 --> 19:03.768
It's just concrete

19:03.851 --> 19:05.436
and grass...

19:06.520 --> 19:07.730
There's nobody in here.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.316
Nobody alive, anyway.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.567
It's nothing.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.653
(Owl hooting)

19:13.736 --> 19:14.904
Quiet too.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.448
Fucking... eerie.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.992
Julian!

19:19.075 --> 19:20.868
Where the fuck are you, man?

19:22.244 --> 19:23.788
Julian!

19:23.871 --> 19:27.458
Various:

19:23.871 --> 19:27.458
(Indistinct shouts)

19:27.541 --> 19:28.709
Fuck's sakes.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.837
Julian:

19:28.793 --> 19:30.837
Ricky! Rick!

19:30.920 --> 19:32.755
Get the fuck

19:30.920 --> 19:32.755
up here, man!

19:32.839 --> 19:34.214
Hey, there!

19:32.839 --> 19:34.214
Yes!

19:32.839 --> 19:34.214
Woman:

19:32.839 --> 19:34.214
Get the fuck

19:34.298 --> 19:36.383
up here!

19:34.298 --> 19:36.383
Yes, yes, yes,

19:34.298 --> 19:36.383
yes, yes!

19:36.467 --> 19:38.594
(Cackling)

19:36.467 --> 19:38.594
Right on!

19:39.428 --> 19:40.638
Julian:

19:39.428 --> 19:40.638
Fuck, yeah!

19:40.721 --> 19:43.223
Ah, fuck.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.767
Julian: (Drunkenly)

19:43.307 --> 19:44.767
Ricky-y-y!

19:44.851 --> 19:46.519
Hey, buddy!

19:44.851 --> 19:46.519
Hey, how's it going?

19:46.602 --> 19:47.770
I love you, man.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.522
Let's get fucking

19:47.854 --> 19:49.522
wasted, bud!

19:49.605 --> 19:50.773
Come on!

19:51.941 --> 19:53.860
I got bad news

19:51.941 --> 19:53.860
today, dude.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.153
And this is Rain.

19:55.235 --> 19:56.696
Hey, how's it going?

19:55.235 --> 19:56.696
Rain.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.489
I'm paying for her.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.489
Nice.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.616
(Giggling)

19:58.572 --> 20:00.616
I heard they told you

19:58.572 --> 20:00.616
you were going to die

20:00.700 --> 20:02.284
or some bullshit.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.284
Yeah!

20:02.368 --> 20:04.954
Old Julian's days are

20:02.368 --> 20:04.954
numbered, I guess, man.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.455
I'm going to,

20:05.038 --> 20:06.455
you know,

20:06.539 --> 20:08.457
I'm going to be

20:06.539 --> 20:08.457
dying soon.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.209
I'm going to be

20:08.541 --> 20:10.209
broke and lonely

20:10.292 --> 20:12.753
and my liver's going

20:10.292 --> 20:12.753
to shit the bed on me,

20:12.837 --> 20:14.588
for fuck's sakes.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.588
(Drunken laughter)

20:14.672 --> 20:17.175
<i>But</i> I will

20:14.672 --> 20:17.175
live every day

20:17.257 --> 20:19.301
like it's every day

20:17.257 --> 20:19.301
for the rest of my life,

20:19.385 --> 20:21.095
and I don't give

20:19.385 --> 20:21.095
a fuck about anything...

20:21.179 --> 20:22.346
Not a fuck!

20:22.429 --> 20:23.597
Not a fuck-it!

20:23.681 --> 20:25.516
I get it, okay, I do.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.309
But seriously, man,

20:25.599 --> 20:27.309
you're listening to

20:25.599 --> 20:27.309
a fucking psychic here.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.187
You can't honestly

20:27.393 --> 20:29.187
believe that shit.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.938
You already know

20:29.269 --> 20:30.938
you're going to die.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.938
Everybody fucking dies.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.066
It's the oval of life.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.066
(Giggling)

20:33.149 --> 20:35.109
Fuck it, I'll get

20:33.149 --> 20:35.109
fucked up with you if

20:33.149 --> 20:35.109
that's what you want,

20:35.193 --> 20:37.070
but it's no fucking

20:35.193 --> 20:37.070
different than

20:35.193 --> 20:37.070
any other day.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.613
We already live every day

20:37.153 --> 20:39.613
like it's our last day

20:37.153 --> 20:39.613
on fucking Earth.

20:39.697 --> 20:42.241
It's the oval of life!

20:39.697 --> 20:42.241
(Laughter)

20:42.324 --> 20:43.492
Fuck!

20:42.324 --> 20:43.492
Seriously, man.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.827
What?

20:43.576 --> 20:44.827
We should get

20:43.576 --> 20:44.827
to the cemetery.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.370
Bubbles is there

20:44.911 --> 20:46.370
by himself.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.370
Oh, man.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.372
He's going

20:46.453 --> 20:48.372
to be fucked.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.372
No, no, no, no, no.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.290
No, no, no.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.290
Let's go help him

20:48.455 --> 20:50.290
make some money.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.290
Fuck that!

20:50.374 --> 20:51.667
I'm staying right

20:50.374 --> 20:51.667
the fuck here

20:50.374 --> 20:51.667
Fuck it.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.212
and we're

20:51.751 --> 20:54.212
getting wasted.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.212
Get a drink.

20:54.294 --> 20:55.462
One drink, come on.

20:55.546 --> 20:56.756
Just one

20:55.546 --> 20:56.756
fucking drink.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.382
One drink.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.803
This is not scary.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.263
Not s...

21:02.887 --> 21:04.263
(Twig snapping, owl hooting)

21:04.346 --> 21:06.891
What the fuck was that?

21:06.974 --> 21:09.810
Jesus! Are you guys

21:06.974 --> 21:09.810
throwing rocks behind me?

21:09.894 --> 21:11.395
To freak me out?

21:11.478 --> 21:14.065
It felt like

21:11.478 --> 21:14.065
something poked me.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.942
This is fucking

21:14.148 --> 21:15.942
awesome!

21:14.148 --> 21:15.942
(Giggling)

21:16.025 --> 21:17.526
Yeah!

21:16.025 --> 21:17.526
I fucking

21:16.025 --> 21:17.526
love it here!

21:17.610 --> 21:19.820
Yeah!

21:17.610 --> 21:19.820
Whoo-hoo!

21:17.610 --> 21:19.820
Okay, but you

21:17.610 --> 21:19.820
know what?

21:19.904 --> 21:21.488
I'm sorry you're dealing

21:19.904 --> 21:21.488
with some shit,

21:21.572 --> 21:23.574
but I'm going to

21:21.572 --> 21:23.574
have to go back to

21:21.572 --> 21:23.574
the cemetery, man.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.201
Ohhh...

21:23.657 --> 21:25.201
I promised Bubbles.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.201
I can't fucking

21:23.657 --> 21:25.201
just not...

21:25.284 --> 21:26.827
No, no, no...

21:25.284 --> 21:26.827
(Groaning loudly)

21:26.911 --> 21:28.079
Fuck that, okay?

21:28.162 --> 21:29.455
Bubbles is okay

21:28.162 --> 21:29.455
on his own, man.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.706
(Shrieking)

21:29.538 --> 21:30.706
Fuck that!

21:30.790 --> 21:32.833
Let him make his

21:30.790 --> 21:32.833
little 1,000 bucks

21:32.917 --> 21:35.753
to get his stupid

21:32.917 --> 21:35.753
fucking recording

21:32.917 --> 21:35.753
on the go, man.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.588
Fuck it!

21:35.836 --> 21:37.588
Listen...

21:35.836 --> 21:37.588
I don't care!

21:37.671 --> 21:39.173
I don't care.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.173
I'll go check.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.883
I'll fucking

21:39.257 --> 21:40.883
go check...

21:39.257 --> 21:40.883
Let's get fucked up!

21:40.967 --> 21:42.384
then we can drink

21:40.967 --> 21:42.384
more after.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.384
Let's get fucked up!

21:42.468 --> 21:44.511
(Shrieking)

21:42.468 --> 21:44.511
Let's get fucked up!

21:44.595 --> 21:45.846
(Wheezy laughter)

21:45.930 --> 21:49.976
Do you guys want

21:45.930 --> 21:49.976
to get fucked up...

21:50.059 --> 21:53.312
or do you want to

21:50.059 --> 21:53.312
get<i> super fucked up?</i>

21:53.395 --> 21:55.439
What are one of

21:53.395 --> 21:55.439
those things?

21:53.395 --> 21:55.439
What the fuck

21:53.395 --> 21:55.439
is that?

21:55.522 --> 21:56.774
Rain:

21:55.522 --> 21:56.774
Mushroom marks.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.484
Best there is.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.484
Julian:

21:56.857 --> 21:58.484
(Giddy laughter)

21:58.567 --> 22:00.402
(Laughing)

21:58.567 --> 22:00.402
Mushrooms!

22:00.486 --> 22:02.196
Mushrooms!

22:00.486 --> 22:02.196
Yes!

22:02.280 --> 22:03.781
Yes.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.781
Yes!

22:03.864 --> 22:05.032
Rain:

22:03.864 --> 22:05.032
(Laughing)

22:05.116 --> 22:06.909
Sorry, Bubs!

22:05.116 --> 22:06.909
(Giggling)

22:07.994 --> 22:09.162
Anyway, I'm not scared,

22:09.245 --> 22:10.454
if that's why you

22:09.245 --> 22:10.454
guys are thinking.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.623
I'm just, you know...

22:12.706 --> 22:15.375
worrying about Ricky

22:12.706 --> 22:15.375
more than anything.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.586
That's all it is,

22:15.459 --> 22:17.586
just worrying.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.547
I mean,

22:19.005 --> 22:20.547
Ricky's not back yet,

22:20.631 --> 22:22.633
which means

22:20.631 --> 22:22.633
he's either on his own

22:22.716 --> 22:24.510
or he's with Julian.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.679
Either way, it's

22:24.593 --> 22:26.679
not fucking good...

22:24.593 --> 22:26.679
I'll tell you that.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.849
Those two could very

22:26.762 --> 22:29.849
easily wind up in jail,

22:29.932 --> 22:32.059
and then I'll have

22:29.932 --> 22:32.059
to deal with it.

22:32.143 --> 22:34.561
I probably should

22:32.143 --> 22:34.561
go look for them,

22:34.645 --> 22:36.105
truth be told.

22:36.189 --> 22:38.565
I mean, as much as

22:36.189 --> 22:38.565
I'd like to stay here

22:38.649 --> 22:42.695
and finish this task,

22:38.649 --> 22:42.695
which would be very easy.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.197
That's the type

22:42.778 --> 22:44.197
of friend I am,

22:44.280 --> 22:47.658
unselfish friend, you know.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.451
So I'll forfeit

22:47.741 --> 22:49.451
the 1,000 bucks

22:49.535 --> 22:51.411
just to look after my friends.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.622
I think that's...

22:51.495 --> 22:53.622
Actually, you know what?

22:53.706 --> 22:56.167
The more I think about it,

22:53.706 --> 22:56.167
that's what I should do.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.336
That's what I should do.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.336
Fuck the money.

22:58.418 --> 23:01.005
Boys, let's two-step it

22:58.418 --> 23:01.005
right the fuck out of here.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.256
Let's go.

23:02.340 --> 23:04.591
Come on, move it.

23:04.675 --> 23:05.926
(Whimpering)

23:10.639 --> 23:12.099
(Shouting)

23:10.639 --> 23:12.099
Julian, where the

23:10.639 --> 23:12.099
fuck are you, man?

23:12.183 --> 23:13.600
I need coleslaw or

23:12.183 --> 23:13.600
something. I'm fucked!

23:13.684 --> 23:15.144
Boys, stop filming me.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.144
I'm too fucked up.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.354
Stop fucking filming me.

23:18.147 --> 23:20.733
Get the fuck off...

23:18.147 --> 23:20.733
Ah, fuck. Jesus Christ!

23:20.816 --> 23:22.651
What the fuck

23:20.816 --> 23:22.651
is going on...?

23:20.816 --> 23:22.651
What's going on, guy?

23:22.735 --> 23:24.195
Oh, you little

23:22.735 --> 23:24.195
fucking whores.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.195
Hey, hey, hey.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.404
Cut the cameras off.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.404
Cut the fucking cameras off.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.032
What the fuck, man?

23:26.488 --> 23:28.032
You like that?

23:28.115 --> 23:29.700
That fucking melts

23:28.115 --> 23:29.700
you, doesn't it?

23:28.115 --> 23:29.700
I'm a damn cop!

23:29.783 --> 23:30.951
What are you doing?

23:29.783 --> 23:30.951
Fucking whores!

23:31.035 --> 23:32.745
What kind of drugs

23:31.035 --> 23:32.745
are you on? Huh?

23:32.828 --> 23:34.914
Take a walk, dummy.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.914
Turn around.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.914
Arms behind your back.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.708
I'm trying to save

23:34.997 --> 23:37.708
the world from these

23:34.997 --> 23:37.708
little green fucking

23:34.997 --> 23:37.708
Martian whores

23:37.791 --> 23:39.377
biting my... Fuck!

23:37.791 --> 23:39.377
Ah, ah!

23:37.791 --> 23:39.377
What the fuck?

23:39.459 --> 23:41.712
Oh, fuck, oh fuck...

23:39.459 --> 23:41.712
Get... get down

23:39.459 --> 23:41.712
right now.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.672
Fuck you, fuck you,

23:41.795 --> 23:43.672
fuck you...

23:41.795 --> 23:43.672
Not in the piss.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.132
Get over here.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.132
(Panting)

23:45.216 --> 23:47.343
Turn around.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.343
Excuse me...

23:47.425 --> 23:49.303
Careful of

23:47.425 --> 23:49.303
my shoes, man!

23:47.425 --> 23:49.303
Excuse me!

23:47.425 --> 23:49.303
Officer, officer.

23:49.387 --> 23:50.888
Excuse me. Hi, hi.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.015
Ricky, Ricky,

23:50.971 --> 23:53.015
calm the fuck down.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.767
Bubbles, tell me

23:53.099 --> 23:54.767
you at least see

23:53.099 --> 23:54.767
these little...

23:54.850 --> 23:56.602
(Whimpering)

23:54.850 --> 23:56.602
green whores.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.602
Ricky, Ricky,

23:56.685 --> 23:57.937
what are you

23:56.685 --> 23:57.937
talking about...?

23:58.020 --> 23:59.688
Ahh! Fuck!

23:58.020 --> 23:59.688
Ricky!

23:58.020 --> 23:59.688
Your friend

23:59.772 --> 24:01.357
is clearly on some

23:59.772 --> 24:01.357
drugs or something.

24:01.439 --> 24:02.816
Bubbles:

24:01.439 --> 24:02.816
Um...

24:01.439 --> 24:02.816
All right,

24:01.439 --> 24:02.816
I'm taking him in.

24:02.900 --> 24:06.362
No! Listen. Uh,

24:02.900 --> 24:06.362
he is on drugs

24:02.900 --> 24:06.362
but officer,

24:06.444 --> 24:08.572
he's not on the type

24:06.444 --> 24:08.572
of drugs you think.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.533
He is on strong

24:08.655 --> 24:11.533
prescription

24:08.655 --> 24:11.533
medication.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.411
I was over here

24:11.617 --> 24:13.411
with him earlier.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.662
We just went to listen

24:13.493 --> 24:15.662
to some jazz music

24:15.746 --> 24:17.873
and he went to

24:15.746 --> 24:17.873
the bathroom.

24:15.746 --> 24:17.873
He's not supposed

24:15.746 --> 24:17.873
to be drinking

24:17.957 --> 24:20.751
and clearly he's

24:17.957 --> 24:20.751
had some alcohol...

24:20.834 --> 24:23.545
Ricky, Ricky.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.545
...and it is reacting

24:23.629 --> 24:26.966
with the very powerful legal

24:23.629 --> 24:26.966
medication that he's on.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.759
It's not...

24:27.049 --> 24:28.759
Ricky, Ricky.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.303
Calm...

24:28.842 --> 24:30.303
Throwing his piss?

24:30.386 --> 24:31.845
Ricky:

24:30.386 --> 24:31.845
We got to get the fuck

24:30.386 --> 24:31.845
out of here, Bubs.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.139
W-w-where y'all from?

24:33.222 --> 24:35.473
Um...

24:33.222 --> 24:35.473
(Indistinct)

24:33.222 --> 24:35.473
Ricky...

24:35.557 --> 24:37.435
We are from

24:35.557 --> 24:37.435
Canada, actually.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.603
Canada, the

24:37.517 --> 24:39.603
Great White North,

24:37.517 --> 24:39.603
you know?

24:39.686 --> 24:41.897
What the fuck you mean,

24:39.686 --> 24:41.897
"the Great White North", huh?

24:41.981 --> 24:43.481
You got a problem with

24:41.981 --> 24:43.481
the Great Black South?

24:43.565 --> 24:45.359
Oh, my God!

24:43.565 --> 24:45.359
You got a problem

24:43.565 --> 24:45.359
with black officers?

24:45.443 --> 24:47.027
No! My God, no!

24:47.111 --> 24:48.946
I think you're

24:47.111 --> 24:48.946
fantastic.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.949
I am down with all the

24:49.029 --> 24:51.949
colours of the rainbow,

24:52.032 --> 24:53.659
all the colours

24:52.032 --> 24:53.659
of the rainbow.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.286
Trying to say

24:53.742 --> 24:55.286
I'm gay?

24:55.369 --> 24:57.079
No!

24:55.369 --> 24:57.079
So, now you have

24:55.369 --> 24:57.079
a problem with

24:55.369 --> 24:57.079
gay people, huh?

24:57.163 --> 24:58.998
Oh, my God, no.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.998
There's a lot of gay

24:57.163 --> 24:58.998
people on the force.

24:59.081 --> 25:02.042
No, I am not...

24:59.081 --> 25:02.042
Listen, I would never...

25:02.126 --> 25:03.627
Even if you were,

25:02.126 --> 25:03.627
I wouldn't care.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.045
I'm down

25:03.710 --> 25:05.045
with everybody.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.381
Ahh, fuck off!

25:05.129 --> 25:07.381
Officer...

25:05.129 --> 25:07.381
Ricky! Ricky.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.300
Listen, I am going

25:07.465 --> 25:09.300
to take him home,

25:09.383 --> 25:11.010
if that's okay.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.010
It hurts...

25:09.383 --> 25:11.010
it hurts so much.

25:11.093 --> 25:13.179
He's clearly

25:11.093 --> 25:13.179
having a reaction.

25:13.262 --> 25:14.930
Ricky...

25:13.262 --> 25:14.930
Cut the fucking

25:13.262 --> 25:14.930
cameras off.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.224
I'll tell you what.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.224
Look...

25:17.308 --> 25:19.352
I'll bring your friend

25:17.308 --> 25:19.352
down to the station,

25:19.435 --> 25:21.270
book him for

25:19.435 --> 25:21.270
public indecency,

25:21.354 --> 25:23.189
public intoxication,

25:23.272 --> 25:25.523
being a public

25:23.272 --> 25:25.523
fucking idiot,

25:25.607 --> 25:26.775
or...

25:26.859 --> 25:28.526
you give me $100,

25:26.859 --> 25:28.526
I'll walk away.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.237
You take your

25:28.610 --> 25:30.237
friend home.

25:30.321 --> 25:32.865
100 bucks?

25:30.321 --> 25:32.865
What's it going to be?

25:32.948 --> 25:36.327
All right.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.327
Here, look...

25:32.948 --> 25:36.327
Various:

25:32.948 --> 25:36.327
(Indistinct chatter)

25:36.410 --> 25:38.620
Here you go.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.538
100 bucks right there.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.291
I'm going to

25:40.622 --> 25:42.291
get him home.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.460
Thank you.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.460
Get him home and tell

25:42.375 --> 25:44.460
him to put his cock up.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.046
I will tell him to

25:44.542 --> 25:47.046
put his penis away.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.506
Thank you, sir.

25:48.588 --> 25:51.384
Ricky, what in

25:48.588 --> 25:51.384
the flying fuck

25:48.588 --> 25:51.384
are you doing?

25:51.467 --> 25:53.135
We got to get

25:51.467 --> 25:53.135
the fuck away from

25:51.467 --> 25:53.135
these damned things.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.054
Away from what?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.054
Just... look

25:53.219 --> 25:55.054
at them all!

25:55.137 --> 25:56.514
Oh, fuck, there's

25:55.137 --> 25:56.514
a bunch of them

25:56.596 --> 25:57.890
coming there

25:56.596 --> 25:57.890
around the corner.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.683
Ricky, what? There's

25:57.973 --> 25:59.683
nothing there!

25:59.766 --> 26:02.186
Ricky, get over here,

25:59.766 --> 26:02.186
for fuck's sakes.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.604
Calm the fuck

26:02.269 --> 26:04.604
down, Ricky.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.690
Ricky, calm

26:04.688 --> 26:06.690
the fuck down.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.734
What the fuck...

26:06.773 --> 26:08.734
Look at me!

26:06.773 --> 26:08.734
Look at me.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.944
What the fuck is

26:08.817 --> 26:10.944
going on with you?

26:08.817 --> 26:10.944
Okay...

26:11.028 --> 26:13.613
Me and Julian

26:11.028 --> 26:13.613
took mushrooms.

26:11.028 --> 26:13.613
We probably

26:11.028 --> 26:13.613
took too many.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.533
I think I might

26:13.697 --> 26:15.533
be seeing things.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.533
I don't know.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.368
It's a good time

26:15.615 --> 26:17.368
but I'm fucked.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.368
Do you fucking think?

26:17.451 --> 26:19.328
Yeah.

26:17.451 --> 26:19.328
There's nothing

26:17.451 --> 26:19.328
here, Ricky.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.621
Calm down.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.621
Everything's fine.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.621
Okay.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.417
Just walk. Where in

26:21.705 --> 26:24.417
the fuck is Julian at?

26:24.500 --> 26:26.544
I've lost him.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.544
It was bad.

26:26.626 --> 26:28.504
What do you mean,

26:26.626 --> 26:28.504
you lost him? Where?

26:28.586 --> 26:32.466
He was with this

26:28.586 --> 26:32.466
stripper hooker

26:28.586 --> 26:32.466
or somebody called

26:28.586 --> 26:32.466
Blizzard or Snow

26:32.550 --> 26:33.759
or Ice or...

26:32.550 --> 26:33.759
What?

26:33.842 --> 26:35.719
And then he bought

26:33.842 --> 26:35.719
a dog, he said.

26:35.802 --> 26:37.430
And he started fucking

26:35.802 --> 26:37.430
bawling his head off.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.931
He bought a dog?

26:39.014 --> 26:40.640
There's only been

26:39.014 --> 26:40.640
a few times in my life

26:40.724 --> 26:42.684
where I've had to deal

26:40.724 --> 26:42.684
with Ricky and Julian

26:42.768 --> 26:44.520
being on mushrooms

26:42.768 --> 26:44.520
at the same time,

26:44.602 --> 26:46.772
and let me tell you,

26:44.602 --> 26:46.772
it is not fun.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.816
The situations they

26:46.855 --> 26:49.816
get into are fucked.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.485
I have the receipt

26:49.900 --> 26:51.485
in my pocket.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.485
Bubbles:

26:49.900 --> 26:51.485
Julian!

26:51.569 --> 26:53.904
I have... Boys, check

26:51.569 --> 26:53.904
this motherfucker out!

26:53.987 --> 26:55.989
Oh, my fuck.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.989
What is going on? Sir?

26:56.073 --> 26:59.076
This mushroom-head

26:56.073 --> 26:59.076
motherfucker

26:56.073 --> 26:59.076
owe me 350!

26:59.159 --> 27:00.827
Okay.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.827
And he won't

26:59.159 --> 27:00.827
give me back

27:00.911 --> 27:02.580
my fucking pony!

27:00.911 --> 27:02.580
Okay. No, listen.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.748
I will take...

27:02.662 --> 27:04.748
Julian,

27:02.662 --> 27:04.748
Julian:

27:02.662 --> 27:04.748
Bubs!

27:04.831 --> 27:05.999
give the man the

27:04.831 --> 27:05.999
money you owe him.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.085
This is my

27:06.083 --> 27:08.085
fucking dog...

27:08.168 --> 27:10.628
Don't you fucking

27:08.168 --> 27:10.628
touch me there,

27:08.168 --> 27:10.628
you motherfucker!

27:10.712 --> 27:12.423
What are you...

27:10.712 --> 27:12.423
He's not

27:10.712 --> 27:12.423
getting it back!

27:12.506 --> 27:14.967
Julian, pay the...

27:12.506 --> 27:14.967
He loves me, Bubs,

27:12.506 --> 27:14.967
he loves me!

27:15.050 --> 27:17.303
Julian, you are

27:15.050 --> 27:17.303
on fucking drugs.

27:17.386 --> 27:19.054
I don't have any

27:17.386 --> 27:19.054
fucking money.

27:17.386 --> 27:19.054
That is not a dog.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.889
I don't have

27:19.138 --> 27:20.889
any fucking money.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.889
That's a mini horse

27:20.973 --> 27:22.682
and you do not

27:20.973 --> 27:22.682
own him.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.682
No, I...

27:22.766 --> 27:24.518
Okay, just... Ricky,

27:22.766 --> 27:24.518
get me some money

27:22.766 --> 27:24.518
right now.

27:24.602 --> 27:25.852
Sir, please,

27:25.936 --> 27:27.104
just calm down.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.104
I've got nothing, Bubs.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.355
The bar tab was

27:27.187 --> 27:28.355
fucking crazy.

27:28.439 --> 27:29.982
I got nothing, man.

27:28.439 --> 27:29.982
Oh, my fuck.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.025
Pimp:

27:30.065 --> 27:32.025
Well, then, that's

27:30.065 --> 27:32.025
your friend, Julian...

27:32.109 --> 27:33.860
Julian:

27:32.109 --> 27:33.860
Oh... What? What?

27:33.944 --> 27:36.155
is gonna fucking die.

27:33.944 --> 27:36.155
No, no, no! Sir!

27:36.238 --> 27:38.282
Sir, listen, how much

27:36.238 --> 27:38.282
does he owe you?

27:38.365 --> 27:39.866
Julian:

27:38.365 --> 27:39.866
Fuck you.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.866
How much does

27:38.365 --> 27:39.866
he owe you?

27:39.950 --> 27:41.118
Pimp:

27:39.950 --> 27:41.118
350!

27:41.201 --> 27:43.036
Oh, my God.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.036
Okay, look, this...

27:43.120 --> 27:44.371
Julian :

27:43.120 --> 27:44.371
Bubs, don't

27:43.120 --> 27:44.371
pay him, man!

27:44.455 --> 27:45.831
This is every

27:44.455 --> 27:45.831
cent I have.

27:44.455 --> 27:45.831
Fuck him!

27:45.914 --> 27:48.708
No, no, no... Bubs!

27:45.914 --> 27:48.708
Would you consider $300?

27:48.792 --> 27:51.086
That's every penny

27:48.792 --> 27:51.086
we have to our name.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.421
I apologize for him.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.421
Are you fuck...

27:52.505 --> 27:54.214
He's on medication.

27:54.298 --> 27:55.633
No, I'm not

27:54.298 --> 27:55.633
on medication.

27:55.715 --> 27:56.883
Give my fucking

27:55.715 --> 27:56.883
pony, man.

27:55.715 --> 27:56.883
Julian,

27:56.967 --> 27:58.552
give me

27:56.967 --> 27:58.552
the fucking leash.

27:58.636 --> 27:59.928
Julian.

27:58.636 --> 27:59.928
Bubs, don't...

28:00.012 --> 28:04.517
Julian! This is not

28:00.012 --> 28:04.517
a dog named Scooby.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.143
Okay, here you go, sir.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.143
Give me my fucking

28:04.600 --> 28:06.143
pony, man.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.145
There you go.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.145
Give me my

28:06.226 --> 28:08.145
fucking pony, man.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.022
Put that down.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.022
You got your lady

28:10.105 --> 28:11.773
and you got your nice

28:10.105 --> 28:11.773
little horse there.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.691
Pimp:

28:11.857 --> 28:13.691
Get the fuck outta here.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.691
Bubs... Bubs...

28:13.775 --> 28:15.068
I'll kill you,

28:13.775 --> 28:15.068
motherfucker.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.612
Motherfucker.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.612
Come on here, girl!

28:16.694 --> 28:19.239
Shit.

28:16.694 --> 28:19.239
Go fuck yourself.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.617
That was mine!

28:19.323 --> 28:21.617
It was mine!

28:19.323 --> 28:21.617
Are you out of

28:19.323 --> 28:21.617
your fucking mind?

28:21.699 --> 28:24.995
He was going to shoot you

28:21.699 --> 28:24.995
over a fucking pony dog!

28:25.078 --> 28:26.497
Are you fucking kid...

28:26.580 --> 28:28.374
Aren't you supposed

28:26.580 --> 28:28.374
to be at the cemetery

28:28.457 --> 28:32.336
making your big...

28:28.457 --> 28:32.336
(slurring) fucking video

28:28.457 --> 28:32.336
recording... song shit?

28:32.419 --> 28:34.588
I was at the

28:32.419 --> 28:34.588
fucking cemetery.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.588
Oh! Oh, what,

28:34.672 --> 28:36.674
did you leave because

28:34.672 --> 28:36.674
you were scared?

28:36.756 --> 28:39.009
Were you

28:36.756 --> 28:39.009
fucking scared?

28:36.756 --> 28:39.009
Oh, I was scared, was I?

28:39.092 --> 28:41.094
Bawk, bawk, bawk.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.094
Huh? Scared?

28:41.178 --> 28:43.639
I wasn't fucking scared!

28:41.178 --> 28:43.639
I wasn't scared one bit.

28:41.178 --> 28:43.639
You were...

28:43.722 --> 28:45.307
You were totally

28:43.722 --> 28:45.307
fucking scared, man.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.434
You want to know

28:45.391 --> 28:47.434
why I'm not there?

28:45.391 --> 28:47.434
Why?

28:47.518 --> 28:49.436
Do you want

28:47.518 --> 28:49.436
to fucking know?

28:47.518 --> 28:49.436
Oh, please tell me,

28:49.520 --> 28:50.896
please.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.896
Because I was

28:49.520 --> 28:50.896
fucking worried

28:50.979 --> 28:52.272
(Voice breaking)

28:50.979 --> 28:52.272
about my two

28:50.979 --> 28:52.272
best friends.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.149
That's why.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.149
I was scared

28:54.233 --> 28:55.609
that something might

28:54.233 --> 28:55.609
happen to you

28:55.693 --> 28:58.070
and what do I find?

28:55.693 --> 28:58.070
What do I find?

28:58.153 --> 28:59.446
Him on mushrooms

28:59.530 --> 29:01.323
with his wiener out,

28:59.530 --> 29:01.323
getting arrested,

29:01.407 --> 29:03.325
and you here with

29:01.407 --> 29:03.325
a fucking mini horse

29:03.409 --> 29:04.660
with a big cock on it,

29:04.743 --> 29:07.037
arguing with

29:04.743 --> 29:07.037
a fucking pimp!

29:07.120 --> 29:09.456
What do you expect?

29:07.120 --> 29:09.456
All right. Okay...

29:09.540 --> 29:11.917
(Voice breaking)

29:09.540 --> 29:11.917
It's 'cause I love you,

29:09.540 --> 29:11.917
you fucking asshole!

29:12.000 --> 29:14.002
(Panting, whimpering)

29:12.000 --> 29:14.002
Okay, all right,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.002
okay, man.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.754
You don't have to cry.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.754
I'm sorry, man.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.754
Ricky:

29:14.086 --> 29:15.754
I'm sorry.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.214
You know what?

29:15.837 --> 29:17.214
It was fucking dumb.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.632
I haven't done

29:17.297 --> 29:18.632
mushrooms in a while

29:18.716 --> 29:20.426
and then they

29:18.716 --> 29:20.426
were on the table

29:20.509 --> 29:22.678
and they were like,

29:20.509 --> 29:22.678
"Ricky, come and..."

29:20.509 --> 29:22.678
(Indistinct muttering)

29:22.761 --> 29:24.137
and fucking I took them

29:22.761 --> 29:24.137
and they're fucking crazy!

29:24.221 --> 29:25.556
Ricky!

29:24.221 --> 29:25.556
And it's good

29:24.221 --> 29:25.556
but it's bad!

29:25.639 --> 29:27.725
Ricky! Ricky!

29:25.639 --> 29:27.725
Just calm down.

29:27.807 --> 29:29.393
Everybody just, please!

29:29.476 --> 29:30.894
Okay, are we

29:29.476 --> 29:30.894
all good?

29:30.977 --> 29:32.605
Do we all love

29:30.977 --> 29:32.605
each other now?

29:32.688 --> 29:33.855
Yes.

29:32.688 --> 29:33.855
Are we all... okay.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.148
All right. Okay.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.148
We always do.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.816
Okay. All right.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.527
How long did that

29:36.900 --> 29:38.527
fucking doctor say

29:36.900 --> 29:38.527
this spell would take

29:38.611 --> 29:40.696
to work on these

29:38.611 --> 29:40.696
fucking things?

29:38.611 --> 29:40.696
Ricky, just...

29:40.779 --> 29:42.239
step away, please.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.157
Keep your distance,

29:42.322 --> 29:44.157
please.

29:44.241 --> 29:45.534
Thank you for

29:44.241 --> 29:45.534
saving us...

29:45.618 --> 29:47.994
Ricky, this is how

29:45.618 --> 29:47.994
people share crabs.

29:48.078 --> 29:50.038
This is how I get

29:48.078 --> 29:50.038
them, right here.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.416
I wouldn't fucking give...

29:50.122 --> 29:52.416
I wouldn't care if

29:50.122 --> 29:52.416
you gave me crabs.

29:52.499 --> 29:55.168
I don't want

29:52.499 --> 29:55.168
any crabs.

29:52.499 --> 29:55.168
Under what

29:52.499 --> 29:55.168
circumstances

29:55.252 --> 29:57.129
would I ever

29:55.252 --> 29:57.129
give you crabs?

29:55.252 --> 29:57.129
Fuck...

29:57.212 --> 29:59.381
Julian:

29:57.212 --> 29:59.381
Where are we going?

29:57.212 --> 29:59.381
We're going to the airport.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.674
Okay. All right.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.674
For fuck's sakes.

30:00.758 --> 30:02.134
(Indistinct muttering)

30:02.217 --> 30:03.843
What the fuck

30:02.217 --> 30:03.843
are you doing?

30:02.217 --> 30:03.843
Ricky...

30:03.927 --> 30:05.596
Will you deal

30:03.927 --> 30:05.596
with him?

30:03.927 --> 30:05.596
Oh, fuck.

30:05.679 --> 30:07.389
Are they coming?

30:05.679 --> 30:07.389
Come on, up! Hey!

30:07.473 --> 30:09.475
Fuck you, you crazy

30:07.473 --> 30:09.475
little bitches!

30:09.558 --> 30:10.976
Tell 'em. Let's go.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.479
Let's go.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.479
Ricky... Oh, my fuck!

30:13.562 --> 30:15.939
How do I get

30:13.562 --> 30:15.939
involved in this?

30:16.022 --> 30:18.942
( â™ª )

31:45.904 --> 31:50.617
(Seabirds squawking)

32:01.169 --> 32:04.840
Fishes:

32:01.169 --> 32:04.840
Oh fuck! Fuck!

32:01.169 --> 32:04.840
Fuck off! Fuck!...

32:04.923 --> 32:08.051
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

32:11.388 --> 32:12.931
(Whisper)

32:11.388 --> 32:12.931
<i>Fuck.</i>

32:13.014 --> 32:15.392
(Light clicks off)

32:13.014 --> 32:15.392
<i>Fuck off.</i>
