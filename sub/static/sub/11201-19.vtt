00:01.267 --> 00:03.735
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:05.872 --> 00:07.339
What exactly do you want from me?

00:07.440 --> 00:12.742
The code to an Ancient tablet
that I helped Qetesh locate long ago.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.814
<i>CARTER: I take it</i>
<i>the anti-Prior device is working.</i>

00:14.914 --> 00:17.075
<i>MITCHELL: Well,</i>
<i>he didn't stop us from zatting him.</i>

00:20.420 --> 00:21.409
What the hell is going on?

00:21.521 --> 00:24.422
I had to be sure
this was working on her first.

00:26.226 --> 00:27.887
We've got to go.

00:39.973 --> 00:40.997
(CHATTERING)

00:46.780 --> 00:48.338
You're bluffing.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.575
You have nothing.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.224
I'll tell you what.

01:00.326 --> 01:05.127
I'll bet you everything I have
on this table against

01:05.231 --> 01:07.597
that cargo ship of yours outside.

01:08.101 --> 01:11.036
Your winnings wouldn't cover
the value of that ship.

01:13.373 --> 01:16.968
- What if I throw in this?
- And what's that supposed to be?

01:20.213 --> 01:22.113
(MEN GASPING)

01:29.789 --> 01:32.986
You've got your wager,
as foolish as it may be.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.852
I guess it's just my lucky day.

02:09.028 --> 02:11.724
I thought this was
an honest establishment.

02:11.831 --> 02:13.321
It is.

02:13.433 --> 02:16.231
And that's why it's necessary
to have you searched.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.844
I don't suppose we could call this even.

02:37.590 --> 02:38.750
Adria?

02:38.858 --> 02:42.624
Hello, Mother. It's good to see you.
It's been far too long.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.061
I did not expect to see you again.

03:55.602 --> 03:58.935
I had to return, Mother.
My work here is unfinished.

03:59.038 --> 04:00.164
Who is this?

04:00.273 --> 04:02.867
You really don't want to know.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.444
Get out, all of you.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.372
(MEN MUMBLING)

04:20.126 --> 04:22.686
I don't suppose you're going to let me just
walk out of here?

04:22.795 --> 04:24.285
I'm afraid not.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.063
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Mother,

04:27.166 --> 04:30.135
but your attempt to destroy the Ori
was unsuccessful.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.804
Am I supposed to take your word for that?

04:33.273 --> 04:36.436
I've been personally supervising
the construction of dozens of ships.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.703
Now that our intergalactic gate
is operational again,

04:38.811 --> 04:40.972
there's nothing to stop them
from coming here.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.516
We should have the entire galaxy
converted in a matter of months.

04:44.617 --> 04:48.053
Just because you've been building ships
doesn't prove anything.

04:48.655 --> 04:51.886
What are you doing here?
Where are your friends from Earth?

04:53.359 --> 04:54.826
Friends come and go.

04:55.995 --> 04:57.622
Have they abandoned you?

04:58.031 --> 05:00.022
I'd rather not talk about it.

05:03.002 --> 05:05.061
I really must know, Mother.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.808
You do realize, in a traditional
mother-daughter relationship,

05:09.909 --> 05:11.968
I'm supposed to be the bossy one?

05:13.680 --> 05:17.707
Oh, whatever.
Makes no difference now, anyway.

05:25.224 --> 05:26.919
I've got it. I figured it out.

05:27.026 --> 05:27.993
Got what?

05:28.094 --> 05:32.554
The answer you were looking for
to the Clava Thesaurusy thingami-jigamy.

05:32.765 --> 05:33.993
The Clava Thessara Infinitas?

05:34.100 --> 05:36.898
Right, that's the one. I know where it is.

05:40.306 --> 05:43.207
The Clava Thessara Infinitas, literally,
"The key to infinite treasure,"

05:43.309 --> 05:45.402
is the Ancient tablet
Athena was seeking from Qetesh.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.912
Now, it supposedly holds the clues to
the whereabouts of a vast storehouse of...

05:49.015 --> 05:52.041
Daniel, this is very interesting.
Get to the good part!

05:54.020 --> 05:54.987
The good part?

05:55.088 --> 05:57.488
I figured it out.
I know where the treasure is.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.956
You solved the Clava Thessara Infinitas?

06:00.093 --> 06:02.152
Yes, I most certainly did.

06:04.931 --> 06:09.163
Daniel shared some of his findings
with me last night before I went to sleep,

06:09.268 --> 06:11.896
and after a rather, well, nasty dream

06:12.004 --> 06:13.972
in which I appeared on
a television program where it seemed

06:14.073 --> 06:16.598
you had to dance with supposedly
well-known personalities

06:16.709 --> 06:18.802
in front of a panel of judges,

06:18.911 --> 06:21.004
a shape came to my mind.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.444
The symbol for infinity?

06:24.550 --> 06:27.986
Yes, infinite treasure, infinity. You see?

06:30.356 --> 06:37.228
And it intersects with six symbols, which,
when combined, correspond with

06:38.030 --> 06:39.258
a gate address.

06:39.365 --> 06:43.199
Why would the Ancients use the Earth
symbol for infinity to hide their treasure?

06:43.302 --> 06:45.736
Actually, no one knows the exact origin
of the symbol itself.

06:45.838 --> 06:48.466
It's been found on Tibetan rock carvings
dating back over a thousand years,

06:48.574 --> 06:49.666
as well as a host of other places.

06:49.776 --> 06:53.109
For all we know, it could well
have originated with the Ancients.

06:53.212 --> 06:56.579
You can rotate that symbol
any which way you want.

06:56.682 --> 06:59.879
Yes, but this is how
it appeared in my dream,

06:59.986 --> 07:03.353
and when we put these six symbols
into the database,

07:03.456 --> 07:06.016
it came up with only one address.

07:06.993 --> 07:09.655
Why does this all sound familiar?

07:11.431 --> 07:14.798
Did Adria not send you information
in dream form to lure us to the planet

07:14.901 --> 07:16.061
where the Sangraal was hidden?

07:16.169 --> 07:18.967
Yes, but, no, this is different.
I came up with this on my own.

07:19.071 --> 07:22.734
Okay, I suppose it is possible
that Qetesh knew its location

07:22.875 --> 07:26.106
and this is simply a latent memory
being dredged up by Athena.

07:26.212 --> 07:27.406
There you go.

07:27.513 --> 07:31.005
Do we have any idea what
this Ancient storehouse actually contains?

07:31.117 --> 07:34.177
No idea, sir, but it must be big if Athena
was so eager to get her hands on it.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.051
I feel very strongly about this, General.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.189
What can it hurt to send a team?

07:42.695 --> 07:44.663
I didn't send you that information.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.631
That's what I tried to tell them,
but they didn't believe me,

07:47.733 --> 07:50.133
especially when the
reconnaissance team returned.

07:50.236 --> 07:50.336
(ALARM SOUNDING)

07:50.336 --> 07:51.200
(ALARM SOUNDING)

07:51.337 --> 07:52.361
What is it?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.600
SG-3 and 8, they're coming in hot.
Open the iris.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.108
(MEN GRUNTING)

08:07.753 --> 08:10.017
They're right on our tail! Shut the gate!
Shut it down!

08:10.122 --> 08:11.316
Do it!

08:12.325 --> 08:15.055
Med teams to the gate room immediately!

08:21.534 --> 08:22.933
What happened?

08:23.035 --> 08:24.502
It was an ambush, sir.

08:24.604 --> 08:27.437
Ori soldiers made our position
as soon as we stepped through the gate.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.100
I lost two men, a couple more injured.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.734
That's not possible. That can't be.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.437
You tell that to the men who died.

08:35.548 --> 08:39.177
- Colonel, debrief in my office.
- Yes, sir.

08:46.325 --> 08:49.317
I was so certain that I was right,
I couldn't leave well enough alone,

08:49.428 --> 08:51.259
and the very next night...

08:51.664 --> 08:53.097
I had the same dream again.

08:53.199 --> 08:59.001
Only this time, the infinity shape appeared
vertically rather than horizontally.

08:59.405 --> 09:03.136
Note that, again,
it intersects with six symbols,

09:03.342 --> 09:08.279
and that, again, the six symbols
only match one address in our database.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.141
What?

09:19.458 --> 09:22.325
What's the problem?
We need to investigate this.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.521
- Vala.
- What?

09:24.630 --> 09:26.530
- Do you not see what's going on here?
- No.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.624
This is Adria telling us where to go
so she can pick us off.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.965
Next, you'll have a dream
where the symbol is on a slight angle,

09:32.071 --> 09:35.598
and I'll bet it will still correspond
to one single gate address.

09:35.775 --> 09:38.505
- She's using you, Vala.
- No. I would know.

09:38.611 --> 09:41.910
Well, you didn't know before, did you?

10:02.668 --> 10:05.034
<i>VALA: Things just got worse from there.</i>

10:12.812 --> 10:13.938
Daniel, what's happening?

10:14.046 --> 10:17.413
It's not looking good. Most of the I.O.A.
Delegates think you've been compromised.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.575
But I didn't do anything wrong.
I was trying to help.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.880
It doesn't matter
what your intentions were.

10:21.988 --> 10:24.684
If Adria can manipulate you like this
any time she wants to,

10:24.790 --> 10:26.985
then you've become a security risk.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.755
They're talking about removing you
from the team.

10:29.862 --> 10:30.886
What?

10:30.997 --> 10:32.828
They're also not comfortable
with the idea of letting you go,

10:32.932 --> 10:35.958
given everything you've learned
about Earth's defenses.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.098
I don't understand.

10:40.439 --> 10:44.432
They're talking about confinement, Vala,
at Area 51.

10:53.452 --> 10:54.919
You don't believe me either.

10:55.021 --> 10:58.252
You can't lie to me, Mother.
I can read the truth in your mind.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.086
I'm just surprised.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.554
So was I.

11:02.528 --> 11:04.655
How did you convince them to let you go?

11:04.764 --> 11:07.858
I didn't. That's the funny thing.

11:10.803 --> 11:13.567
<i>VALA: I guess they thought a locked door</i>
<i>could hold me.</i>

11:18.377 --> 11:21.244
<i>Or they never imagined</i>
<i>I'd make it off the base.</i>

11:41.701 --> 11:43.100
What do you plan to do now?

11:43.202 --> 11:46.194
Well, I had just won myself a cargo ship

11:46.305 --> 11:49.240
when you dropped by
and broke up the game, so...

11:49.709 --> 11:53.270
Is that really what you want?
A life alone, always on the run?

11:53.379 --> 11:56.143
That life no longer suits you, Mother.
You belong with me.

11:56.248 --> 11:59.376
Return with me to my ship, and take up
your rightful place as Mother of the Orici.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.477
Adria, stop it. I am not your mother.

12:03.255 --> 12:06.656
I may have given birth to you,
but we are not family,

12:06.759 --> 12:08.454
so stop pretending.

12:12.932 --> 12:17.232
You just need time to think about it.
We will talk further on our way.

12:19.105 --> 12:22.768
- Where are we going?
- To find the Clava Thessara Infinitas.

12:22.875 --> 12:26.003
- You think it's real?
- I think Colonel Carter was right.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.239
This might be knowledge from your time
as a Goa'uld

12:28.347 --> 12:30.542
being dredged up
through your subconscious.

12:30.649 --> 12:32.207
Well, you're too late.

12:33.185 --> 12:35.949
Despite the fact that they didn't trust me,
they thought they should check out

12:36.055 --> 12:38.387
the second gate address anyway,
just to be safe.

12:38.657 --> 12:41.353
I overheard them planning the mission
as I was leaving.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.623
Yes, but there's something
you're not telling me.

12:45.531 --> 12:49.365
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Don't play games with me, Mother.

12:49.468 --> 12:53.529
If I have to force this information
out of you, it will be quite unpleasant.

12:57.109 --> 13:01.068
They were worried about an ambush,
so they're taking the ship.

13:01.814 --> 13:04.612
We can beat them if we travel by stargate.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.877
Let's go. Now.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.924
Howdy!

13:26.038 --> 13:28.905
You didn't really think
we'd invite you to a party

13:29.008 --> 13:31.238
and not disable
your funky powers, did you?

13:31.844 --> 13:33.334
I have no idea what's going on.

13:33.445 --> 13:35.310
Don't worry, Vala, it's all part of the plan.

13:35.414 --> 13:38.008
Don't you ever speak to me, ever again.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.082
Lower your weapons.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.682
Buddy, I think you've got
the wrong planet.

13:47.793 --> 13:50.523
Lower your weapons or we will all perish.

13:50.629 --> 13:53.860
My master Lord Ba'al has targeted
this location from orbit.

14:11.383 --> 14:14.113
What are you doing?
Carrying out my orders.

14:22.761 --> 14:25.229
Okay, that wasn't part of the plan.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.900
Welcome.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.828
Don't waste your time.

14:33.939 --> 14:36.669
I've learned a thing or two
from my Tau'ri friends.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.706
This room is being flooded with
the same kind of EM field they generate

14:40.813 --> 14:42.610
with that clever little device of theirs,

14:42.715 --> 14:45.206
the one that prevents you
from using your mind powers.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.012
You should know
that won't hold me forever.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.712
Of course not.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.225
But that won't be a problem
after I'm done with you.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.361
They got the jump on us.
We had no time to react.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.963
Exactly how did Ba'al
manage to pull this off?

15:09.074 --> 15:11.235
I don't know,
but they had detailed intelligence.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.402
He was aware of both our locations
and intentions.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.639
The bigger question is,
what does Ba'al want with Adria?

15:15.748 --> 15:18.308
Perhaps he intends to negotiate
for shared control of the galaxy.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.544
She doesn't strike me as the sharing type.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.917
Either way, we do not want
those two hanging out together.

15:23.022 --> 15:25.718
Exactly. We have to get her back.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.485
- We're on it, sir.
- Wait.

15:28.327 --> 15:29.658
How's Vala?

15:31.664 --> 15:32.824
Pissed.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.231
Is somebody going to fill her in?

15:35.334 --> 15:37.996
Absolutely. Just not us.

15:43.809 --> 15:48.439
This isn't right, you know.
I escaped fair and square.

15:48.547 --> 15:51.015
Bringing me back here
is tantamount to kidnapping.

15:51.116 --> 15:54.449
Listen, we know you're upset, but you
have to understand, this is part of a plan.

15:54.553 --> 15:57.818
Upset? Why would I possibly be upset?

15:57.923 --> 16:00.619
Maybe because I was
betrayed and abandoned

16:00.726 --> 16:05.060
by the only people in the entire galaxy
I thought were my friends. Don't be silly.

16:06.498 --> 16:09.558
We are your friends,
and we did not betray you.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.602
You didn't exactly back me up,
now, did you?

16:11.704 --> 16:13.729
What she means is,
none of it actually happened.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.204
What are you talking about?

16:15.307 --> 16:19.243
This device is a slightly altered version
of the memory implant technology

16:19.345 --> 16:21.813
we received from a race
called the Galarans.

16:21.914 --> 16:24.906
We used it to create a fictional memory
and implant it in your mind.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.609
And we knew you'd have trouble
understanding all of this,

16:26.719 --> 16:28.482
so we took the liberty
of making a recording

16:28.587 --> 16:30.851
before you underwent the procedure.

16:31.223 --> 16:32.212
Look.

16:32.324 --> 16:35.987
<i>Tilt it up, all right. Oh, yeah.</i>

16:36.095 --> 16:37.756
<i>Thank you, now I can see.</i>

16:37.863 --> 16:38.887
<i>JACKSON: We're rolling!</i>

16:38.998 --> 16:41.489
<i>Oh, we're on? Why didn't you say so?</i>

16:41.600 --> 16:42.624
<i>JACKSON: Gum!</i>

16:45.104 --> 16:48.596
<i>Thanks! Hello, gorgeous.</i>

16:49.475 --> 16:51.670
<i>If you're watching this, you're obviously</i>
<i>back at Stargate Command</i>

16:51.777 --> 16:56.009
<i>and you are probably thinking that</i>
<i>everyone around you has gone completely</i>

16:56.348 --> 16:57.372
<i>- wonko.</i>
- Wonko.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.610
<i>With the possible exception of Daniel,</i>
<i>who, let's face it,</i>

16:59.718 --> 17:01.413
<i>was always a little bit...</i>

17:01.854 --> 17:02.912
<i>JACKSON: Vala!</i>

17:03.222 --> 17:08.592
<i>Sorry. Seriously, though,</i>
<i>substituting our memories was my idea.</i>

17:08.694 --> 17:11.959
<i>Brilliant, I know, and incredibly brave,</i>

17:12.064 --> 17:14.396
<i>but it was the only way</i>
<i>for the plan to work,</i>

17:14.500 --> 17:16.161
<i>so if you are watching this,</i>

17:16.268 --> 17:20.500
<i>you have obviously made it back,</i>
<i>and let me be the first to say, well done.</i>

17:20.839 --> 17:23.205
<i>And enjoy the substantial pay rise</i>
<i>that's been promised to you</i>

17:23.308 --> 17:24.297
<i>if the mission succeeds.</i>

17:24.410 --> 17:26.071
<i>JACKSON: Okay,</i>
<i>that's enough. Thank you.</i>

17:26.178 --> 17:27.167
<i>VALA: Okay.</i>

17:27.513 --> 17:29.071
<i>How was...</i>

17:30.215 --> 17:33.548
We heard that Adria had returned
through the supergate.

17:33.652 --> 17:35.779
Now, if the Ori are dead,
we thought we might be able

17:35.888 --> 17:38.049
to convince her to leave quietly
with her army.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.022
We knew that she'd be able to tell
if you were lying to her,

17:40.125 --> 17:42.889
so, as far as you were concerned,
it wasn't a lie.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.325
I escaped using a Sodan cloak.

17:47.866 --> 17:51.893
You allowed me to be exposed to radiation
so that you could carry out your plan.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.801
Your plan.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.397
And no, that was also
part of the false memory.

17:56.508 --> 17:59.477
We escorted you to the planet where
Adria found you and we dropped you off.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.637
You slept through it like a baby.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.817
So, no I.O. A?

18:09.288 --> 18:11.415
No Reynolds' men?

18:11.523 --> 18:15.186
No television program
about dancing with supposed celebrities?

18:16.962 --> 18:19.192
Actually, that part was real.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.196
How very disturbing.

18:25.370 --> 18:26.428
Yeah.

18:43.522 --> 18:45.888
- Comfy?
- You've made a terrible mistake.

18:45.991 --> 18:48.357
Release me now and I will be merciful.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.449
You're so much more pleasant

18:49.561 --> 18:52.223
when you lack the ability
to snap my neck with your thoughts.

18:52.331 --> 18:55.823
You're a fool, dealing with powers
way beyond your means.

18:55.934 --> 18:57.060
When my army catches up to you...

18:57.169 --> 18:59.501
Don't waste your breath.
Your army has no idea where you are,

18:59.605 --> 19:02.403
and it'll be days before they even begin
to question your disappearance.

19:02.508 --> 19:06.604
Even then, all their queries
will lead them to the Tau'ri.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.270
If you intend to kill me,

19:08.380 --> 19:12.214
you should know the Ori
will not halt their attacks on this galaxy.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.878
I have no intention of killing you.

19:15.020 --> 19:18.649
As a matter of fact, my whole plan
hinges on your being very much alive.

19:18.757 --> 19:21.351
So you can ransom me for your freedom?

19:21.493 --> 19:25.293
Far from it. You can offer me something
far more valuable,

19:25.397 --> 19:27.490
control of your army.

19:29.134 --> 19:31.864
- They'll never listen to you.
- No.

19:31.970 --> 19:33.528
But they do listen to you.

19:33.639 --> 19:37.973
There's nothing you can do
to make me bend my army to your will.

19:38.076 --> 19:39.043
(CHUCKLES)

19:41.847 --> 19:46.045
Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

19:55.694 --> 19:59.653
Agent Barrett has some information
regarding Ba'al's whereabouts.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.458
I got a call from one of my agents,

20:02.568 --> 20:05.401
undercover inside Ba'al's operations
here on Earth.

20:05.737 --> 20:07.706
Apparently, the clones are planning
to meet as a group.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.434
Apparently, the clones are planning
to meet as a group.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.700
Where and when?

20:09.808 --> 20:12.276
P3R-112, today.

20:13.278 --> 20:16.111
- Not a lot of notice.
- I just got the intel an hour ago.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.807
How reliable is it?

20:17.916 --> 20:19.008
My guy's embedded at the top.

20:19.117 --> 20:20.948
He wouldn't break cover
unless he was sure.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.521
Well, we've been here before.
We have a pretty good idea of the layout.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.386
- Take a Marine unit.
- Yes, sir.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.865
Kind of a quiet spot
for such a big meeting.

20:44.977 --> 20:48.310
- I think that's the idea.
- I'm not seeing a lot of movement.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.380
I think I know why.

21:09.701 --> 21:12.363
Looks like somebody got here before us.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.835
No wounds. No sign of combat.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.999
- Symbiote poison?
- I believe so.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.907
Why would the Ba'als kill their own Jaffa?

21:20.712 --> 21:23.875
I don't think the Jaffa were
the intended target.

21:53.612 --> 21:56.012
At last, the guest of honor.

22:03.221 --> 22:04.188
(SHRIEKING)

22:08.493 --> 22:11.929
You two are about to become
very well acquainted.

22:24.776 --> 22:28.212
Well, you've got to hand it to him.
The man throws a mean dinner party.

22:28.313 --> 22:30.338
Well, he knows we're coming after him.
He's covering his tracks.

22:30.449 --> 22:31.609
Indeed.

22:31.717 --> 22:32.684
(BEEPING)

22:34.986 --> 22:36.783
Stand back! I'm warning you!

22:37.422 --> 22:40.186
- Just take it easy.
- We're not going to hurt you.

22:42.861 --> 22:43.919
Much.

22:44.496 --> 22:46.361
I thought they were all dead.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.057
Apparently not.

22:57.609 --> 22:59.600
And I believe I know why.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.476
We've got a lead.

23:05.584 --> 23:09.145
Once he woke up, our Jaffa friend
was surprisingly forthcoming.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.723
He confirmed the fact that Ba'al was
behind the attack that killed all his clones.

23:12.824 --> 23:14.257
Apparently, he had assembled them
for what they thought

23:14.359 --> 23:16.384
was a meeting on the Adria situation.

23:16.495 --> 23:18.861
Instead, he beamed in canisters
of symbiote poison.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.454
Quite the door prize.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.159
Yeah, whatever Ba'al's up to,
he doesn't want any witnesses.

23:23.268 --> 23:26.328
Lucky for us, he didn't realize
one of his Jaffa uses tretonin.

23:26.438 --> 23:29.100
- Any idea where he is now?
- Actually, yes.

23:29.207 --> 23:32.574
The Jaffa was able to provide us with the
coordinates where Ba'al's ship is located.

23:32.677 --> 23:37.341
The <i>Odyssey</i> is standing by.
You move out again in one hour.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.723
Assuming for a moment
this Jaffa's telling the truth

23:51.830 --> 23:54.856
and we actually find Ba'al's ship,
how do you propose we capture Adria?

23:54.966 --> 23:58.902
Same way he got her off the planet.
We beam in, tag her and beam out.

23:59.004 --> 24:00.904
It's a big ship, Colonel.
How are we going to find her?

24:01.006 --> 24:03.167
Well, actually, it shouldn't be that difficult.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.209
We're assuming Ba'al has
some sort of technology

24:05.310 --> 24:06.834
similar to our own anti-Prior device.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.469
Otherwise,
she would have used her powers

24:08.580 --> 24:10.172
the instant he beamed her on board.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.443
If we scan for those
specific EM frequencies,

24:12.551 --> 24:15.748
we should be able to pinpoint her location
with a fair degree of accuracy.

24:15.854 --> 24:18.982
All this presupposes that we get the drop
on him, and he doesn't raise his shields.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.148
Yeah.

24:20.992 --> 24:23.051
All right, then. Good luck.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.965
Vala, you got a sec?

24:32.103 --> 24:33.229
Sure.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.740
You're welcome to sit this one out.

24:36.842 --> 24:39.675
(STUTTERING)
Why? I mean, why would I?

24:39.778 --> 24:42.713
You know why we're
bringing Adria back, right?

24:42.814 --> 24:47.444
Sure, to tell her to take her army
and clear off.

24:47.819 --> 24:51.516
And if she resists, we will take action.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.649
By killing her?

24:58.430 --> 25:01.888
- You're okay with that?
- Of course.

25:07.272 --> 25:08.569
All right.

25:17.315 --> 25:20.580
Wow. I take it we are cloaked?

25:21.052 --> 25:23.111
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

25:26.758 --> 25:29.192
Colonel, the result of your scan is here.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.599
This room shows a pronounced level
of the same EM radiation

25:37.702 --> 25:40.535
generated by the anti-Prior device.
Looks like you were right.

25:40.639 --> 25:42.231
Let's go get her.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.284
That's it.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.832
Don't worry. This will all be over soon.

26:08.934 --> 26:09.992
(BEEPING)

26:10.101 --> 26:11.534
Jaffa!

26:42.834 --> 26:44.893
<i>Odyssey,</i> we are good to go.

26:54.145 --> 26:56.739
Hey. Wake up.

27:03.188 --> 27:04.348
Sorry.

27:04.723 --> 27:07.089
It's not very comfortable.
Believe me, I know from experience,

27:07.192 --> 27:09.456
but we're not taking any chances.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.222
It's over, Adria.

27:13.131 --> 27:17.431
(IN BA'AL'S VOICE) I'm afraid you're
mistaken. Adria is no longer available.

27:26.911 --> 27:29.311
<i>LANDRY: (ON SCREEN)</i>
<i>Ba 'al is in Adria?</i>

27:29.414 --> 27:32.815
Yes, sir.
It's the bad-guy equivalent of cordon bleu.

27:32.951 --> 27:35.385
It actually makes sense
from his perspective, sir.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.387
CARTER: Not only has he taken on
a more powerful host,

27:37.489 --> 27:39.753
but Adria's also in control of the Ori army.

27:39.858 --> 27:42.656
<i>So he convinces them to do his bidding</i>
<i>and not hers?</i>

27:42.761 --> 27:45.355
When you think about it,
their goals aren't all that different.

27:45.463 --> 27:47.863
Control of the galaxy,
worshipped by millions.

27:47.966 --> 27:51.800
And if the Ori are dead, he'll never be
called to the carpet by the boys upstairs.

27:51.903 --> 27:53.165
<i>What do we do now?</i>

27:53.271 --> 27:54.863
Kill them both.

27:58.376 --> 28:01.345
Hard to argue with that logic. It's a twofer.

28:01.446 --> 28:04.973
Well, there's no guarantee that her army
would stop fighting even if she was dead.

28:05.083 --> 28:07.847
The only way to be certain is
for her to order them to stand down.

28:07.952 --> 28:09.317
Then how do we get her to do that?

28:09.421 --> 28:12.481
Well, if Ba'al's symbiote is suppressing
Adria's consciousness,

28:12.590 --> 28:14.182
we should be able to do the same thing.

28:14.292 --> 28:18.422
- Swap Ba'al out for someone we can trust.
- The Tok'ra.

28:18.763 --> 28:21.664
Doesn't suppressing the host
go against their fundamental beliefs?

28:21.766 --> 28:23.734
Well, I'm sure they'd make
an exception in this case.

28:23.835 --> 28:27.327
We've been trading intelligence with
the Tok'ra since the Ori ships first arrived.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.532
They want to get rid of them
just as much as we do.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.632
<i>Get in touch. See if you can set it up.</i>

28:31.743 --> 28:35.338
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>keep a close eye on your guest.</i>

28:43.188 --> 28:46.817
So, have you decided
what you intend to do with me?

28:47.525 --> 28:51.723
Well, we're still weighing our options.
Teal'c here had a good idea.

28:52.597 --> 28:55.395
- I can imagine.
- No, you cannot.

28:57.102 --> 29:00.003
I must caution you against
doing anything too rash.

29:00.105 --> 29:03.370
In fact, your best course of action
would be to release me.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.376
I think we have
a difference of opinion there.

29:06.478 --> 29:09.970
My whole plan was to order the Ori army
back out of this galaxy.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.379
You let me carry it out,
we'll be rid of them forever.

29:12.484 --> 29:16.648
That is our plan as well,
only without your participation.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.814
What do you mean?

29:18.923 --> 29:21.687
He means we're going to bring in
someone a little more reliable.

29:21.793 --> 29:25.160
See, right now, you're like a Pinto engine
in a '71 Mustang.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.356
We've got to swap you out
for a big-block Tok'ra.

29:27.465 --> 29:31.231
It takes a great deal of effort
to suppress a consciousness this powerful.

29:31.336 --> 29:33.463
The Tok'ra don't have the strength.

29:33.872 --> 29:37.865
Not to mention the fact that I'll kill Adria
the moment you try to remove me.

29:37.976 --> 29:40.137
Well, that's great. We can live with that.

29:40.245 --> 29:44.614
Perhaps, but remember,
I'm sharing Adria's mind.

29:44.716 --> 29:47.844
You would lose all access
to the knowledge I possess.

29:49.053 --> 29:50.418
For example?

29:50.989 --> 29:54.015
For one thing,
I can confirm the Ori are dead.

29:55.493 --> 29:57.825
And that's just the beginning.

29:58.029 --> 30:03.490
With my knowledge and your pluckiness,
we can accomplish a great deal.

30:04.736 --> 30:07.034
Remember how we worked together
to locate the Sangraal?

30:07.138 --> 30:10.835
As I recall,
your efforts were not particularly helpful.

30:11.242 --> 30:13.142
Of course, it's your decision.

30:13.711 --> 30:16.043
But it seems you only have two options:

30:16.147 --> 30:18.115
Work with me to our mutual benefit,

30:18.216 --> 30:22.585
or kill us both and miss out on
everything I have to offer.

30:31.729 --> 30:35.062
You're just in time.
The Tok'ra contingent's about to arrive.

30:44.542 --> 30:45.531
I am Ta'seem.

30:45.643 --> 30:48.737
I will be performing the surgery.
These are my assistants.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.678
Welcome on board the <i>Odyssey.</i>
I'm Colonel Davidson.

30:50.782 --> 30:53.478
I'm sure you know Colonel Carter,
Dr. Jackson, and Vala.

30:53.585 --> 30:57.112
Yes. I knew you as Qetesh.

30:58.389 --> 31:00.755
Things have changed a little since then.

31:02.126 --> 31:04.458
News that the leader of the Ori army
had been captured

31:04.562 --> 31:06.723
came as a ray of hope to my people.

31:06.831 --> 31:10.358
That being said, the extraction procedure
that we are about to undertake

31:10.468 --> 31:12.197
is extremely difficult.

31:12.303 --> 31:14.237
Even though we have refined
the process considerably,

31:14.339 --> 31:17.797
there remains a very real risk
that Adria will not survive.

31:17.909 --> 31:20.139
Well, the only other option we have
is to leave Ba'al in

31:20.245 --> 31:22.338
and trust he's telling the truth, so...

31:23.014 --> 31:24.948
Then we should begin immediately.

31:25.049 --> 31:28.815
Zanuf, the symbiote that we brought,
cannot survive outside of a host for long.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.911
The infirmary is this way.

31:40.932 --> 31:42.263
Time to go.

31:42.634 --> 31:44.067
What about our arrangement?

31:44.168 --> 31:45.829
Oh, you mean the part
where you string us along

31:45.937 --> 31:48.770
till you overcome the effects
of the anti-Prior device?

31:48.873 --> 31:50.670
We'll pass.

31:54.679 --> 31:55.873
(MONITOR BEEPING)

31:59.150 --> 32:03.382
The sedative appears to be working.
Heart rate and BP are holding steady.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.065
TA'SEEM: There it is. Let's begin.

32:17.802 --> 32:19.895
<i>We will need to work quickly.</i>
<i>The symbiote's autonomic response</i>

32:20.004 --> 32:22.700
<i>can trigger complications,</i>
<i>even under anesthetic.</i>

32:24.876 --> 32:27.003
<i>Initiating the first incision.</i>

32:28.680 --> 32:30.170
<i>I need suction.</i>

32:44.395 --> 32:45.589
What's up?

32:46.030 --> 32:47.054
Nothing.

32:47.165 --> 32:49.725
Just didn't feel like sticking around
for the surgery.

32:49.834 --> 32:51.825
You know, weak stomach and all that.

32:51.936 --> 32:55.770
Hey, you sure you're okay with this?

32:56.808 --> 32:58.435
Why does everyone keep asking me that?

32:58.543 --> 33:00.340
Because she's your daughter.

33:00.979 --> 33:04.278
And no matter what she's done, it must be
difficult to see her treated this way.

33:04.382 --> 33:06.748
Let's get something clear.
She's not my daughter, Daniel.

33:06.851 --> 33:10.412
The Ori impregnated me against my will
and forced me to bring her into the galaxy.

33:10.521 --> 33:14.048
I was an incubator,
a shipping crate and nothing more.

33:14.158 --> 33:17.650
I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe
that you don't feel something.

33:17.762 --> 33:21.755
I do. Satisfaction at seeing their plan fail.

33:25.503 --> 33:28.370
There, I've severed
the primary nerve conduit.

33:28.473 --> 33:30.600
You see how the filaments are retracting?

33:30.708 --> 33:33.006
Now, moving on to the lateral...

33:33.378 --> 33:35.141
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

33:35.780 --> 33:37.145
What is it?

33:38.149 --> 33:40.640
I was afraid this might happen.

33:44.922 --> 33:47.390
- Hey, what's up?
- Trouble with the surgery.

33:58.436 --> 33:59.528
What happened?

33:59.637 --> 34:02.504
Ba'al decided to be
even more difficult than usual.

34:02.607 --> 34:05.098
We were able to extract him,
but not before he released

34:05.209 --> 34:07.939
a deadly toxin
into Adria's nervous system.

34:09.247 --> 34:11.647
Can't the Tok'ra symbiote heal her?

34:11.749 --> 34:14.616
Unfortunately, we were unable
to complete the implantation.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.051
The host body was simply too weak.

34:17.155 --> 34:18.782
Adria is unconscious at the moment,

34:18.890 --> 34:21.859
but when she wakens,
she will suffer greatly before she dies.

34:21.959 --> 34:25.122
The one thing we can do for her
is an increased dosage of the toxin.

34:25.229 --> 34:27.288
It will kill her instantly.

34:27.398 --> 34:30.731
In the interest of patient care
and for our own safety,

34:30.835 --> 34:33.861
I recommend that
we administer it immediately.

34:40.144 --> 34:41.406
Do it.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.682
I'd like to be there.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.010
Crap!

35:56.721 --> 35:57.949
(ALARM BLARING)

36:17.141 --> 36:18.130
Adria.

36:18.242 --> 36:20.733
You and your friends
were trying to kill me, Mother.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.870
I can't let that happen.

36:29.453 --> 36:30.511
SG-1, come in.

36:30.621 --> 36:31.849
<i>What the hell's going on down there?</i>

36:31.956 --> 36:35.255
<i>I'm getting reports that all sections</i>
<i>around the infirmary are being sealed off.</i>

36:35.359 --> 36:37.657
It's Adria, sir. She's barricaded herself in.

36:37.762 --> 36:39.525
<i>Is there any way you can</i>
<i>beam us directly there?</i>

36:39.630 --> 36:40.619
Negative.

36:40.731 --> 36:43.165
<i>She seems to be generating</i>
<i>some kind of EM interference.</i>

36:43.267 --> 36:46.259
We're going to need a cutting torch
down here ASAP.

36:46.370 --> 36:47.735
<i>You got it.</i>

36:47.838 --> 36:49.567
There's an auxiliary control console
on this level.

36:49.674 --> 36:51.608
If I can get to it,
I might be able to override it.

36:51.709 --> 36:52.698
Go.

36:53.311 --> 36:54.744
(MOANS)

36:57.315 --> 36:59.283
You can quit acting.
You're obviously not sick.

36:59.383 --> 37:02.511
No, this body really is dying.

37:02.887 --> 37:06.653
I just want to use what little time
I have left as wisely as possible.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.952
By doing what?
Destroying me and my friends?

37:09.060 --> 37:10.755
Don't be silly, Mother.

37:10.861 --> 37:14.490
If I wanted to kill you,
I could have done it a long time ago.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.960
No, I need time to prepare.

37:19.103 --> 37:20.798
Prepare for what?

37:22.173 --> 37:23.197
Ascension.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.505
- Vala!
- Don't.

37:27.144 --> 37:28.975
Vala, can you hear me?

37:33.117 --> 37:35.711
Guys, it's Daniel. I can't reach Vala.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.955
Daniel Jackson, what is your location?

37:41.058 --> 37:43.390
Just outside the infirmary.
Adria's locked them in.

37:43.494 --> 37:44.927
We are blocked as well.

37:45.029 --> 37:47.623
Colonel Mitchell is attempting
to cut through one of the doors.

37:47.732 --> 37:49.199
Well, you better hurry up.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.598
I think I figured out
what she's trying to do.

37:51.702 --> 37:53.693
Adria's trying to ascend.

37:57.942 --> 38:01.742
Adria, you don't have to do this.

38:01.846 --> 38:04.337
Granted, this wasn't part of my plan,

38:04.882 --> 38:08.818
but I can still accomplish a great deal,
perhaps even more.

38:08.919 --> 38:10.580
More what?
More deaths, more enslavement?

38:10.688 --> 38:13.350
Don't attempt to play on
my compassion, Mother.

38:13.791 --> 38:17.386
As you said, I'm not your daughter.
I'm an Ori.

38:17.495 --> 38:19.292
Part Ori, part human.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.129
That will soon change.

38:43.854 --> 38:46.721
Great. Carter, how's that override coming?

38:46.824 --> 38:49.520
Well, it's not.
I mean, it wouldn't do any good.

38:51.462 --> 38:52.690
What the hell does that mean?

38:52.797 --> 38:54.560
She's not actually in control of the system.

38:54.665 --> 38:58.066
I think she's just holding the doors shut
with her mind.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.569
Cutting torch will take too long.

39:04.408 --> 39:07.070
- What is it?
- Your friends are very determined.

39:21.492 --> 39:24.689
Daniel, I'm showing a coolant leak
in the hallway you're in right now.

39:24.795 --> 39:28.322
Spotted that, thanks. It's Adria.
She's trying to distract us.

39:28.432 --> 39:30.593
Well, it's a hell of a distraction.
That stuff's toxic.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.168
You need to get out of there right now.

39:32.269 --> 39:34.169
<i>JACKSON: Yeah,</i>
<i>that's going to be a problem.</i>

39:34.271 --> 39:35.795
Can you shut it down?

39:35.906 --> 39:39.535
I'll have to re-route coolant out of
the entire section. I'm on it.

39:42.747 --> 39:46.581
Vala, if you can hear me,
I really need you to open the door!

39:50.354 --> 39:52.219
Adria, stop it, please!

40:21.018 --> 40:22.315
That's it.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.890
I always wondered
if you had it in you to kill me.

40:38.469 --> 40:40.027
Goodbye, Mother.

40:44.775 --> 40:48.142
- Nice work.
- It wasn't us. Adria let go.

41:15.773 --> 41:16.740
(COUGHING)

41:17.475 --> 41:19.670
- Jackson!
- I'm okay.

41:25.416 --> 41:26.883
Where's Adria?

41:28.719 --> 41:29.811
She's gone.

41:47.271 --> 41:48.932
JACKSON: And once Adria realized
she couldn't save herself,

41:49.039 --> 41:51.030
she had no choice but to ascend.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.909
What do you suppose this means for us?

41:54.011 --> 41:56.206
To be honest, I'm not sure.
If the Ori are still out there,

41:56.313 --> 41:58.008
then, presumably, she's joined the fight,

41:58.115 --> 42:01.107
but if Ba'al was telling the truth
and the Ori are dead,

42:01.218 --> 42:03.743
then she just assumed
all the power they once had.

42:03.854 --> 42:06.687
Either way, we could see some incarnation
of her again down the road.

42:06.790 --> 42:08.951
Holding a serious grudge.

42:09.059 --> 42:11.994
At least we may take comfort
in the knowledge that Ba'al is dead.

42:12.096 --> 42:15.065
Wouldn't put a deposit down
on that just yet.

42:17.468 --> 42:20.028
When we were breaking Adria
out of Ba'al's ship,

42:20.137 --> 42:22.537
I ran across another clone guarding her.

42:22.907 --> 42:24.704
Killed him, but where there is one...

42:24.808 --> 42:26.173
There may be more.

42:26.343 --> 42:29.278
We captured and killed Adria and Ba'al
on the same day.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.372
- Are you telling me this is all a wash?
- No.

42:33.784 --> 42:36.776
We dealt the Ori movement
a serious blow today,

42:36.887 --> 42:40.015
and we rid ourselves of Adria
for the time being.

42:40.124 --> 42:42.820
That is definitely a step ahead.
