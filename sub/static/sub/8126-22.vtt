mom?
Hi. We're home.

00:54.720 --> 00:59.624
Daddy? Daddy, you upstairs?
Anybody home?

00:59.692 --> 01:01.960
Ma, you in the kitchen?

01:02.028 --> 01:04.796
That's funny.
Sunday afternoon, nobody's home.

01:04.864 --> 01:07.799
- You know what that means?
- No. What?

01:07.867 --> 01:11.335
We got the whole house
to ourselves.

01:11.403 --> 01:13.138
Michael, no.

01:13.205 --> 01:15.140
Michael, yes.

01:16.642 --> 01:20.211
Come here! Come here!
No, Michael. No.

01:20.279 --> 01:22.781
Me, Tarzan. You, Jane.

01:22.848 --> 01:24.816
We go up to tree house.

01:24.884 --> 01:27.152
Oh, boy.
Jane putting on weight.

01:28.788 --> 01:31.756
No, Tarzan.
I lost five pounds.

01:31.824 --> 01:35.259
I think I found it.
Come. We go.

01:35.327 --> 01:40.665
[ Gasps ]
Gloria! What happened?
Did you hurt your foot?

01:40.733 --> 01:44.169
Oh. Hi, ma. No.
How are you?

01:44.236 --> 01:46.237
Hi.

01:47.372 --> 01:52.143
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm sorry.

01:52.211 --> 01:55.780
Oh, uh, no. No, ma.
That's, uh, that's all right.

01:55.848 --> 02:00.118
Where you been?
I had a special meeting
at the church.

02:00.186 --> 02:03.922
We had a cake sale.
Guess what I got.

02:03.989 --> 02:06.091
Uh, a cake.

02:06.158 --> 02:08.258
You guessed right away.

02:09.862 --> 02:14.332
They had so many
delicious things.
Oh. Hey, can I have a piece?

02:14.399 --> 02:17.535
Oh, sure. Get a knife
and some plates, Gloria.

02:17.603 --> 02:21.172
We made $102
for a worthy cause.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.174
Yeah?
What cause was that?

02:23.242 --> 02:27.311
I don't know. That's what
the next meeting is about.

02:27.379 --> 02:31.482
Where's Archie? How come
he's not home watching
the big football game?

02:31.550 --> 02:34.085
I guess he's still
at the launderette.

02:34.153 --> 02:36.721
You got daddy to go
to the launderette?
How'd you do that?

02:36.789 --> 02:39.490
I just asked him.
And he said yes?

02:39.558 --> 02:44.763
Yeah.
Right after he stopped yelling
and kicking the laundry bag.

02:44.830 --> 02:47.665
All right,
now listen to me,
all of youse.

02:47.733 --> 02:51.102
See what I'm doin' here?
I'm lockin' the door.
And youse all keep it locked.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.371
Archie!
What's goin' on?
What happened?

02:53.438 --> 02:55.840
Dummy up. Dummy up now
and I'll tell you.

02:55.908 --> 03:00.478
That arab laundryman Joe girgis
is gonna be comin' over here
after me.

03:00.545 --> 03:04.382
And when he comes,
we got to make like
there's nobody home, see?

03:04.449 --> 03:08.286
And from now on, Edith,
don't you set foot in
his launderette no more.

03:08.353 --> 03:12.090
I don't care what it costs,
go to the chinks.

03:12.158 --> 03:16.094
But don't go near
that arab again.

03:16.162 --> 03:18.296
Not unless you got
a dirty camel to wash.

03:18.363 --> 03:21.032
I'm gonna sue
that Egyptian phony.

03:21.100 --> 03:24.068
Arch. Arch.
He's not an Egyptian.
He's a Syrian.

03:24.136 --> 03:27.305
It's the same thing!
They're born pirates,
all of them!

03:27.372 --> 03:29.307
Here, look at
this here laundry.

03:29.374 --> 03:32.543
It's in shreds,
every piece of it there.
Archie, what happened?

03:32.611 --> 03:35.213
I took it into his place
and I stuck it in one
of them machines.

03:35.281 --> 03:38.983
I turned it on,
the machine busts wide open,
there's a flood all over.

03:39.051 --> 03:42.187
I run for my life.
I go down on one knee
and look at that.

03:42.254 --> 03:45.723
My brand-new Sunday pants there,
tore 'em wide open.

03:45.791 --> 03:49.828
I hurt my knee too.
Oh, no. I'm gonna sue that guy.

03:49.895 --> 03:52.964
First thing in the morning,
I'm gonna get myself
a good Jew lawyer.

03:55.767 --> 03:58.236
Archie, do you always
have to label people?

03:58.304 --> 04:01.105
Why can't you just get a lawyer?
Why does it have to be
a Jewish lawyer?

04:01.173 --> 04:05.476
'Cause when I'm gonna sue
an arab, I'm gonna get a guy
that's full of hate.

04:11.550 --> 04:13.885
Archie, look at this.

04:13.953 --> 04:17.620
You must have forgot
to separate the coloreds
from the whites.

04:17.689 --> 04:22.626
Archie forget to separate
the coloreds from the whites?

04:36.675 --> 04:39.844
Look, arch, I know you're upset,
but what do you want
to sue him for?

04:39.912 --> 04:41.846
Why don't you
talk to him first?

04:41.914 --> 04:43.948
I tried that.
How you gonna talk to a guy...

04:44.016 --> 04:46.417
Who's screamin' and cryin'
at the same time?

04:46.485 --> 04:48.920
I mean cryin'.
I mean real tears.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.322
He's standing there.
They're comin' out of him
like a geyser.

04:51.390 --> 04:54.292
Yeah.
Mr. girgis cries a lot.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.396
They're all that way, them
arabs. It's in their blood,
that wailin'.

04:58.463 --> 05:00.899
- What are you talking about?
- You never heard that?

05:00.966 --> 05:04.635
Why do you think
those people got
the wailin' wall?

05:04.703 --> 05:07.805
Archie, it's the Jewish people
who go to the wailing wall.

05:07.873 --> 05:09.807
That's only on one side
of it, smart guy.

05:09.875 --> 05:12.377
Who do you think is wailin'
on the other side?

05:16.382 --> 05:20.151
By the way, where was youse two
when all that laundry
had to be took?

05:20.219 --> 05:24.588
I went down to the library.
I had to look up a few things.
And I was helping him.

05:24.656 --> 05:27.892
What was you doin',
readin' to him, huh?

05:27.960 --> 05:31.296
Funny. Very funny. I'm doing
a paper on the supreme court.

05:31.363 --> 05:34.299
What's more important--
your dirty laundry
or the supreme court?

05:34.366 --> 05:37.302
The way Nixon's filling it,
what's the difference?

05:37.369 --> 05:42.206
Don't talk to me!
Archie, can I get you
some lunch?

05:42.274 --> 05:45.243
Is it lunchtime already?
Look, it's after 1:00.

05:45.311 --> 05:48.146
I'm missin'
the whole football game.
Get away from me, all of you!

05:48.213 --> 05:51.816
I'd better see
if there's anything
in this we can save.

05:51.883 --> 05:53.851
Gloria, will you help me?
<i>Oh, sure.</i>

05:53.919 --> 05:56.087
Go on, the two of youse.
Count up all that
damage there,

05:56.155 --> 05:58.222
'cause I'm gonna sue
that arab through the nose.

05:58.290 --> 06:01.692
And remember, Edith,
all them clothes
is practically new.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.495
<i>[ Tv announcer ]</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>our national anthem.</i>

06:04.563 --> 06:07.398
Good. The national anthem.
That means they ain't
started yet.

06:07.466 --> 06:09.667
We're in luck.
<i>¶ oh, say can you see ¶</i>

06:09.734 --> 06:12.136
<i>¶ by the dawn's</i>
<i> </i> <i>early light ¶</i>

06:12.204 --> 06:15.239
that is one terrible song.

06:18.010 --> 06:21.545
Don't start up nothin'
with me, meathead.
I'm watchin' the game.

06:21.613 --> 06:23.647
That's a beautiful song
and shut your face.

06:23.715 --> 06:26.250
Arch, the song glorifies war.

06:26.318 --> 06:29.253
And even as a song, it stinks.
Nobody can remember the words.

06:29.321 --> 06:31.522
You gonna ruin
this game for me?
Can you remember the words?

06:31.590 --> 06:34.692
Certainly, I can.
Come on, give me
the first few lines.

06:34.759 --> 06:38.796
Give me that thing.
I'll turn it on as soon
as you give me the lines.

06:38.864 --> 06:41.765
Oh, say can you see
by the dawn's early light...

06:41.833 --> 06:44.268
What so proudly we hailed,
of thee I sing.

06:46.005 --> 06:48.706
Wrong.
It ain't wrong.

06:48.773 --> 06:51.675
It is too.
"Of thee I sing" is from
"my country 'tis of thee."

06:51.743 --> 06:53.677
That's wrong.
What are you talking about?

06:53.745 --> 06:56.280
The next line of the
"star-spangled banner" is "at
the twilight's last gleaming."

06:56.348 --> 06:58.516
"At the twilight's
last gleaming" comes after
"of thee I sing."

06:58.583 --> 07:02.353
You've just proven my point.
Nobody can remember the words
because they're rotten words.

07:02.421 --> 07:06.357
Listen. "Oh, say, does
that star-spangled banner
ye-et wave?"

07:06.425 --> 07:08.426
What kind of word is "ye-et"?

07:09.761 --> 07:12.096
If it's
in the national anthem,
it's a good word!

07:12.164 --> 07:13.797
"Ye-et"?

07:13.865 --> 07:16.867
Yeah. "Ye-et."
I use it all the time.
Ye-et. Ye-et.

07:16.935 --> 07:18.936
Now give me "tha-at"!

07:22.041 --> 07:25.676
- What's all
the screaming about?
- The national anthem.

07:25.744 --> 07:29.047
Oh. Did the singer
forget the words again?

07:30.516 --> 07:32.450
<i>[ Doorbell rings ]</i>

07:32.518 --> 07:36.787
I'll get it.
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>
<i>Wait. Don't get nothin'.</i>

07:36.855 --> 07:39.190
I told you.
Get away from that door.

07:39.258 --> 07:41.859
It's that arab
laundryman Joe girgis.

07:41.927 --> 07:45.463
Now shush. Make like
there's nobody home.

07:45.531 --> 07:49.534
<i>I know you're in there,</i>
<i>Archie bunker! I see you</i>
<i>through the window!</i>

07:49.601 --> 07:52.270
He's seen you through
the window, Archie.

07:52.337 --> 07:54.305
Did he, Edith?

07:56.141 --> 07:59.544
Get away from there, girgis!
I ain't talkin' to you
except through a lawyer!

07:59.611 --> 08:03.047
My name's pronounced "girgis,"
and I want to talk to you
right now!

08:03.115 --> 08:05.849
Get off my stoop
or I'll sic the dog on you!

08:05.917 --> 08:08.919
You ain't got a dog, bunker,
and you owe me money!

08:08.987 --> 08:11.155
Archie, let him in.
The neighbors will hear.

08:11.223 --> 08:15.293
You bet the neighbors will hear!
Archie bunker owes me money!

08:15.360 --> 08:17.628
Hey, hey, girgis.
Listen, America!

08:17.696 --> 08:20.598
Archie bunker owes me money!

08:20.665 --> 08:23.568
Why, you common,
ignorant thing, you.

08:23.635 --> 08:26.036
Why would you yell that way
on a Sunday afternoon?

08:26.105 --> 08:30.374
You broke my best machine.
It's gonna cost me a good
85 bucks to fix it. Pay me!

08:30.442 --> 08:34.812
Me pay you? Your dumpy
machine ruined my laundry!
You owe me money.

08:34.879 --> 08:38.182
Edith made it out to worth
about 40 or 50, $65 there.

08:38.250 --> 08:41.152
Some of our best haberdashery
was in that load, right, Edith?

08:41.220 --> 08:45.423
Oh, yeah. There was six pairs
of fruit of the loom shorts--

08:45.491 --> 08:47.458
stifle yourself!

08:47.526 --> 08:49.927
That laundry you ruined
was worth a small fortune.

08:49.995 --> 08:52.396
That's right.
Eighty-nine cents a pair.

08:52.464 --> 08:54.898
<i>Get over there</i>
<i>and eat cake, will you?</i>

08:54.966 --> 08:57.801
You ruined my best washer.

08:57.869 --> 09:00.438
The machine I started
my business with.
My first top-loader.

09:00.506 --> 09:04.208
Never a day's trouble.
Never stopped. Never leaked.
Never jammed.

09:04.276 --> 09:09.380
Then along you come with
your lousy fruit of the looms
and tear the guts out of it.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.049
Oh. Get a load of this here.

09:12.117 --> 09:14.051
There goes the geyser again.

09:14.119 --> 09:17.588
We're gonna have to put down
newspaper for this guy.

09:17.656 --> 09:21.159
- Leave the guy alone.
- Will you go and help
your mother eat cake?

09:21.226 --> 09:25.396
You got some nerve comin'
over here and sayin' that
about that machine.

09:25.464 --> 09:27.565
That machine was ready
for the junk pile.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.867
That machine was a jewel
until you overloaded it.

09:29.934 --> 09:32.336
I'm telling the truth,
as God is my judge.

09:32.404 --> 09:34.372
God? What God? Allah?

09:34.439 --> 09:36.607
Allah don't
cut no ice around here.

09:38.777 --> 09:40.811
What are you talking about?
I'm a methodist.

09:40.879 --> 09:43.881
A methodist?
Maybe comin' through
the immigration you was.

09:43.948 --> 09:47.951
But you started facin' east
as soon as you got an apartment.

09:48.019 --> 09:50.321
No, buddy,
I'm gonna sue you.

09:50.389 --> 09:53.924
If anybody's gonna sue,
it's gonna be me.
You ain't got a leg to stand on.

09:53.992 --> 09:58.429
That's what I'm gonna
sue you about. Look at that.
A hole in my Sunday pants.

09:58.497 --> 10:01.432
Probably a torn "filament"
right there in the kneecap.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.634
Oh, no, buddy,
I'm gettin' a lawyer after you.

10:03.702 --> 10:05.670
Then I'll get
a lawyer too.

10:05.737 --> 10:08.639
Wait a second.
You're not gonna use a lawyer
for a case like this.

10:08.707 --> 10:10.641
You're gonna have to go
to a small-claims court.

10:10.709 --> 10:12.643
You're not gonna be
able to do that...

10:12.711 --> 10:15.713
Because you know
you guys ain't gonna be able
to afford to miss work.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.715
So why don't you
settle it yourselves?

10:17.782 --> 10:20.718
You get somebody
to act impartial,
sort of a referee.

10:20.785 --> 10:23.887
Somebody you both trust.
You tell them what happened,
let them decide.

10:23.955 --> 10:26.557
That's a good idea.
We'll get someone
who's fair and honest.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.159
In New York? Oh, geez!

10:30.495 --> 10:34.865
How about the reverend feltcher?
He's fair and honest.

10:34.933 --> 10:38.202
That's when he's workin'.
We don't know what
he does on his off-duty.

10:40.905 --> 10:43.574
Maybe Dr. Evans
would come over.

10:43.642 --> 10:47.578
Come on. What do you think,
he's Marcus welby?
He don't make no house calls.

10:47.646 --> 10:51.982
I got it. I know someone.
The lady I'm thinking about
is perfect for the job.

10:52.050 --> 10:55.953
Hold it. When you say lady,
no dice. Women is out.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.955
Daddy, you're such
a male chauvinist.

10:58.022 --> 10:59.990
In this day and age,
how can you say that?

11:00.058 --> 11:03.261
Like this here--
no women.

11:03.328 --> 11:06.530
But the lady I'm talkin'
about is your wife.
Huh?

11:06.598 --> 11:09.433
- Oh, my.

will you do it,

11:11.637 --> 11:14.639
Oh, no, Mr. girgis.
I couldn't do that.

11:14.706 --> 11:16.807
You see, I'm Archie's wife.

11:16.875 --> 11:20.378
Hold it. Everybody knows
you're my wife.
Sure you're my wife.

11:20.445 --> 11:22.413
But that's got nothin'
to do with anythin'.

11:22.481 --> 11:25.983
But, Archie, a judge
has to be impartial.

11:26.050 --> 11:30.321
Edith, you can be married to me
and still be impartial there.

11:30.389 --> 11:34.091
What are you talkin' about?
It's a good idea, girgis.
How come you thought of Edith?

11:34.159 --> 11:36.827

of my first customers.

of his launderette...

through the first rinse.

You want to use the bathroom?
Sure. Go on upstairs, girgis.

to be so smart and all.

about there, Edith?

a little court, that's all.

13:12.491 --> 13:17.060
Oh, Archie, I'm so worried
about bein' a judge.
It's a big responsibility.

13:17.128 --> 13:19.062
Why? It's
an open-and-shut case.

13:19.130 --> 13:22.132
Open-and-shut?

the evidence yet.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.469
She's gonna hear the evidence.
I want her to hear the evidence.

13:25.537 --> 13:29.273
I just don't want the evidence
to get in the way, that's all.

13:29.340 --> 13:33.210
- In the way of what?
- In the way, Edith,
of a fair and honest decision.

13:33.278 --> 13:36.480

I'll do the honest thing.

13:36.548 --> 13:38.482

Now you know
there's such a thing as
bein' overhonest, you know?

13:42.287 --> 13:44.789
And any real judge will
tell you that that's bad.

13:44.856 --> 13:46.791
Bad? Why?

13:46.858 --> 13:49.293
Overanything is bad, Edith.
Overworkin', overeatin'.

22:01.652 --> 22:06.489
But why?
You know how mad you get
when you gain a few pounds.

22:06.557 --> 22:08.558
Don't talk to me!

22:11.629 --> 22:14.764
You ain't guilty.
I'm guilty.
What's the difference?

22:14.832 --> 22:18.402
You or me, I'm the guy
that's gotta pay!
Oh, geez.

22:18.469 --> 22:21.738
What are you
cryin' about now?
You heard. You won.

22:21.806 --> 22:24.074
I'm cryin' because I'm happy.

22:25.876 --> 22:29.712
I mean,
this woman has redeemed
my faith in human nature.

22:31.215 --> 22:35.218
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm sorry.

22:35.286 --> 22:38.555
I'll send you the bill
in the morning.

22:40.658 --> 22:43.226
Good-bye, everybody.

23:17.128 --> 23:19.129
Get out of my chair.

23:27.372 --> 23:29.306
Daddy, don't be angry.

23:29.374 --> 23:31.574
You didn't want ma
to lie, did you?

23:32.643 --> 23:34.878
Who's talkin' about lyin'?

23:34.945 --> 23:37.381
I'm talkin' about families
stickin' together.

23:37.448 --> 23:42.252
Oh, Archie, I believe
in families stickin' together.

23:42.320 --> 23:48.091
But if I hadn't told the truth,
you'd never be able
to trust me again.

23:48.159 --> 23:51.328
And then how could we
stick together?

24:02.740 --> 24:06.709
You have ruined
another Sunday.

24:18.822 --> 24:24.428
You know, Archie,
I was thinkin' about that
king in the Bible-- Solomon.

24:24.495 --> 24:28.798
Remember the story about
the two women who was
fightin' over the baby...

24:28.866 --> 24:32.469
And they asked Solomon to judge
who was the real mother?

24:32.537 --> 24:35.539
And Solomon called
for a sword and said,

24:35.606 --> 24:38.208
"divide the living child
in two...

24:38.276 --> 24:42.679
And give one half to
the first woman and one half
to the second woman."

24:42.746 --> 24:46.216
And the first woman said,
"no. Don't hurt the child.
Give it to her."

24:46.284 --> 24:49.086
And the second woman said,
"no. Cut the child in two."

24:49.153 --> 24:53.290
But Solomon said,
"the child will not be hurt.

24:53.357 --> 24:55.459
"Give it to the first woman.

24:55.526 --> 25:00.497
Because her love has proved
that she's the real mother."

25:00.565 --> 25:05.535
Oh, my. That Solomon,
he was so smart.

25:06.604 --> 25:08.771
That's my point exactly,
Edith.

25:08.839 --> 25:11.608
I should have got
a smart Jew after that arab.

25:30.194 --> 25:34.131
