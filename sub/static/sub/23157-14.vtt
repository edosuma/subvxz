WEBVTT

00:00.131 --> 00:03.658
Go to the man, give him the money
and get the information.

00:11.142 --> 00:15.374
He tries to blackmail your grandmother with some information
he has about you, and you say you know nothing about it?

00:15.446 --> 00:17.175
Why are you doing this to me?

00:24.956 --> 00:29.017
Is that you, Amy?
Who's there? Who is it?

01:41.286 --> 01:43.220
Magnum!

01:45.669 --> 01:47.660
Magnum.!

01:50.174 --> 01:52.233
Morning, Higgins.

01:52.310 --> 01:56.269
- Your phone has been disconnected.
- What?

01:56.347 --> 01:59.339
Your phone has been disconnected!

02:00.551 --> 02:03.042
Disconnected? I thought
it was just out of order.

02:03.121 --> 02:05.612
I checked with the phone company.
It's been disconnected.

02:05.690 --> 02:08.920
Why would they do that? Usually because
one doesn't pay one's phone bill.

02:08.993 --> 02:11.723
Well, I always pay my phone bill.
Always?

02:11.796 --> 02:14.026
Well, sometimes I'm a little late.
Aha!

02:14.098 --> 02:18.398
But not this month. Besides, what business is
it of yours whether my phone is out of order?

02:18.469 --> 02:20.664
It's not out of order.
It's been disconnected.

02:20.738 --> 02:23.744
And it makes no difference to me until I
become your answering service. Higgins.

02:23.809 --> 02:27.245
I've taken dozens of calls from virtually
every scoundrel on this island, Higgins!

02:27.320 --> 02:30.756
Including tasteless, provocative messages
from your floozy girlfriends.

02:30.816 --> 02:34.081
I don't have any floozy girlfriends. Waiting
this very moment on Robin's private line...

02:34.702 --> 02:36.727
is a woman who asked me to,
and I quote,

02:36.804 --> 02:42.208
"" Tell that big hunk of a man to get his
body to the phone, so I can breathe heavy."

02:44.846 --> 02:46.746
That sounds like Agatha.

02:46.814 --> 02:48.839
I don't care
what her name is, Magnum.

02:48.916 --> 02:51.680
Oh, yes, you do. No, I don't.

03:00.995 --> 03:04.761
Agatha? Thomas. How did
you know it was me?

03:04.832 --> 03:07.027
I didn't tell Higgins
who was calling.

03:07.101 --> 03:09.433
Just a lucky guess.
What can I do for you?

03:09.504 --> 03:13.668
Are you in the mood to visit
an aging and tiresome woman?

03:13.741 --> 03:17.768
Oh, I'd rather see you instead.
Oh, Thomas.

03:17.845 --> 03:20.678
If only you'd been 20 years older,

03:20.748 --> 03:23.273
or I'd been 20 years younger,

03:23.351 --> 03:25.717
or both.

03:25.787 --> 03:29.416
When do you want me?
This is disgusting!

03:29.490 --> 03:32.254
Right, you got it.
About an hour. Okay.

03:34.362 --> 03:37.354
She wants to thank you
for bringing me to the phone.

03:37.432 --> 03:41.129
That is all. I will not become a party
to lascivious telephone calls...

03:41.202 --> 03:43.636
with disreputable women.

03:43.705 --> 03:46.469
Higgins, that was Agatha Kimball.

03:46.541 --> 03:49.009
Agatha Kimball?

03:50.778 --> 03:55.181
As in King Kamehameha Club
Agatha Kimball.

03:56.250 --> 03:59.947
You just hung up on
the nicest blind lady I know.

04:52.473 --> 04:54.464
It's lovely.

04:56.244 --> 04:58.371
You really think so?
I thought you closed the door...

04:58.446 --> 05:00.880
because of all the sour notes
that I've been hitting.

05:00.948 --> 05:05.715
No. I was talking about your cologne...
the scent, it's lovely.

05:05.787 --> 05:08.551
But your playing is lovely too.

05:08.623 --> 05:12.559
Now you're being really sweet because you know
I'm getting to this passage with the octaves...

05:12.627 --> 05:15.323
and I've never once gotten through it.

05:15.396 --> 05:19.059
It takes practice, Amy.
It just takes practice.

05:19.133 --> 05:22.591
Your father mastered the piano,
and I'm sure that you will too.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.661
It's in the Kimball blood.

05:26.073 --> 05:28.007
Yes, I guess it is.

05:29.444 --> 05:32.038
I think I'll go out in the garden
for a while,

05:32.113 --> 05:34.581
but please continue playing.

05:34.649 --> 05:37.413
I'm sure I'll be able
to hear you from out there.

05:52.166 --> 05:54.794
Oh, Grandma! Grandma?

05:56.537 --> 05:58.698
Stewart! Stewart!

06:00.708 --> 06:03.268
Stewart! Oh, God.

06:06.047 --> 06:08.481
It really made me happy
to hear from Agatha this morning.

06:08.549 --> 06:13.418
I hadn't talked to her in over a year, so I
was looking forward to seeing her again.

06:13.488 --> 06:16.082
I was also looking forward
to seeing Amy,

06:16.157 --> 06:18.853
since I hadn't seen her
in over a year either.

06:25.733 --> 06:29.829
I know I put that ramp back there
after I trimmed the flower beds.

06:29.904 --> 06:33.101
Well, you just didn't get it back
completely. She could've killed herself.

06:33.174 --> 06:37.736
I'm sorry, Mr. Crane, but I didn't know
if I was responsible for that.

06:37.812 --> 06:39.746
I'm very, very sorry.

06:39.814 --> 06:42.942
Okay, we'll talk about it later.

06:43.017 --> 06:46.111
May I help you?
Yes, I'm here to see Agatha.

06:46.187 --> 06:51.124
Well, I'm afraid she can't be disturbed
right now. Wait a minute. She called me.

06:51.192 --> 06:54.787
Well, I'll tell her you came by, and
maybe she'll get back to you, Mr., uh...

06:54.862 --> 06:58.491
- Magnum.
- Stewart, who is it?

06:58.566 --> 07:01.057
Amy. Tom.

07:02.637 --> 07:05.504
What are you doing here?
Agatha called me.

07:05.573 --> 07:07.234
She did? Yeah.

07:07.308 --> 07:09.435
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:10.745 --> 07:13.043
When did she call you?
This morning.

07:13.114 --> 07:16.277
After the accident?
What accident?

07:16.350 --> 07:18.841
Well, her wheelchair
went off a ramp and she fell.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.980
- Is she okay?
- Amy, I don't think that we should...

07:22.056 --> 07:24.081
I'm so sorry.
I'm being very rude.

07:24.158 --> 07:27.321
Thomas, this is my husband,
Stewart Crane. Stewart, Tom Magnum.

07:27.395 --> 07:29.158
How do you do? Stewart.

07:29.230 --> 07:31.824
I don't think we should disturb her.
I think she needs her rest.

07:31.899 --> 07:35.733
I think that Tom will be like a tonic
for her. Well, maybe you're right.

07:35.803 --> 07:39.239
I, uh... I have a few phone calls to make.
Will you excuse me? It was nice to meet you.

07:39.307 --> 07:41.366
Nice meeting you.

07:49.216 --> 07:53.209
Husband? Mm-hmm. We were
married six months ago.

07:53.287 --> 07:55.755
Oh, congratulations, Amy.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.950
I really think you mean that.

07:58.025 --> 08:00.016
I do.

08:00.962 --> 08:04.557
Agatha, this medication
will help you sleep.

08:04.632 --> 08:07.396
That's precisely why
I'm not going to take it.

08:07.468 --> 08:09.902
Maybe I can get her
to take it, Doctor.

08:09.971 --> 08:13.304
Thomas.
Hi, Agatha. How you doing?

08:13.374 --> 08:16.400
Amy said you had a fall.
Oh, it was nothing.

08:16.477 --> 08:22.245
- You could have killed yourself. - The caretaker forgot
to put the ramp all the way back. That's all it was.

08:22.316 --> 08:25.410
That's not the point. I don't
wanna hear any more about it.

08:25.486 --> 08:29.923
Now, please, let's forget about it.
I feel fine.

08:29.991 --> 08:32.687
And I'd like everybody
to leave this room...

08:32.760 --> 08:34.818
except Thomas.

08:42.003 --> 08:43.994
And shut the door.

08:45.640 --> 08:49.940
He's a very pushy doctor. I don't like
pushy people. You know what I mean?

08:51.345 --> 08:55.179
How you doing?
Oh, you still got it.

08:55.249 --> 08:57.683
I'm glad.

08:57.752 --> 09:00.482
I thought maybe you might have
shaved it off.

09:00.554 --> 09:03.648
Agatha, did you just call me here
to check my mustache?

09:04.725 --> 09:07.489
No. I...

09:07.561 --> 09:10.962
I'm in need of your services
again, Thomas.

09:11.032 --> 09:13.500
Does this have something
to do with your fall?

09:13.567 --> 09:15.501
No.

09:15.569 --> 09:18.436
No, it's about Amy.

09:18.506 --> 09:21.100
Yesterday morning I received
a telephone call from a man...

09:21.175 --> 09:26.010
who said he had some
"" enlightening information about Amy."

09:26.080 --> 09:31.882
And for the sum of $25,000
he would reveal the information to me...

09:31.952 --> 09:33.886
and only to me.

09:34.955 --> 09:39.221
That's all he said?
Just "" enlightening information?"

09:39.293 --> 09:41.124
That's all.

09:41.195 --> 09:44.858
So, I want you to go to the man,

09:44.932 --> 09:48.231
give him the money
and get the information.

09:48.302 --> 09:52.068
Agatha, I think before you start
throwing around 25 grand, we should...

09:52.139 --> 09:54.972
I don't wanna argue about it.

09:55.042 --> 09:57.772
If you don't wanna do it, I'll get
somebody else, but I'd prefer you do it...

09:57.845 --> 10:00.473
because I know that I can
trust you, Thomas Magnum.

10:01.615 --> 10:03.879
Well, I'll do it, Agatha, but...

10:03.951 --> 10:06.010
Thank you.

10:07.021 --> 10:10.718
The money's in a envelope
in my nightstand there.

10:10.791 --> 10:14.090
I'll get it.
The instructions are in it.

10:14.161 --> 10:16.493
And when you go to the man,

10:16.564 --> 10:21.365
whatever he tells you,
you keep to yourself.

10:21.435 --> 10:23.699
Agatha, you know I wouldn't
tell a soul except you.

10:23.771 --> 10:26.239
I don't want you to tell even me.

10:27.508 --> 10:31.000
I like my life the way it is.
I don't want anything to change.

10:32.213 --> 10:35.808
When my son ran out on Amy's mother
all those years ago,

10:35.883 --> 10:39.216
I thought I might never know the joy
of my only grandchild.

10:39.286 --> 10:44.019
And if it hadn't been for you being able to find Amy
and bringing us together after all those years...

10:44.091 --> 10:47.618
I don't want anything to destroy
what it took me so long to find.

10:48.896 --> 10:51.262
So, you go to the man,

10:51.332 --> 10:53.357
forget what he tells you...

10:53.434 --> 10:55.800
and see that he never bothers me again.

10:58.172 --> 11:00.265
You will, won't you, Thomas?

11:02.109 --> 11:04.202
You know I will.

11:05.513 --> 11:07.811
Take care. Mmm.

11:16.824 --> 11:20.123
Nice car. Thanks, Mr. Crane.

11:20.194 --> 11:24.597
Amy tells me you're responsible for uniting
her with Agatha after her parents died.

11:24.665 --> 11:27.133
Well, I made a few phone calls.

11:27.201 --> 11:30.136
Traced Amy to the mainland.
Put Agatha in contact with her.

11:30.204 --> 11:34.470
That's funny. She seems forever in your
debt. I never stop hearing about you.

11:34.542 --> 11:37.272
Well, she needn't be.
I did it as a favor to Agatha.

11:37.344 --> 11:40.108
And ended up getting favors
from Amy?

11:43.551 --> 11:46.952
Mr. Crane, I always admired
Amy's taste,

11:47.021 --> 11:48.955
up till right now.

11:49.023 --> 11:53.653
I'm not a threat to you, so don't come
looking at me like I'm her long-lost lover.

11:53.727 --> 11:56.594
I'm here at Agatha's request,
not Amy's.

11:58.732 --> 12:00.666
Uh, wait a minute. I...

12:02.336 --> 12:04.395
I apologize. Uh...

12:05.873 --> 12:08.307
I'm... I'm a jealous husband.

12:08.375 --> 12:10.502
I...

12:10.578 --> 12:12.842
Amy's been acting
a little strange recently,

12:12.913 --> 12:14.881
and when I saw the two of you, I...

12:14.949 --> 12:17.008
I'm sorry. I really am.

12:18.619 --> 12:22.521
I guess we're all a little bit jumpy
after Agatha's string of accidents.

12:22.590 --> 12:25.491
What are you talking about?
What string of accidents?

12:25.559 --> 12:28.926
Weird things have been happening...
near misses with reckless drivers,

12:28.996 --> 12:31.624
a couple of accidents
with the wheelchair...

12:31.699 --> 12:33.860
and other peculiar little things.

12:33.934 --> 12:36.198
Why would someone try
and harm Agatha?

12:36.270 --> 12:39.569
I don't know. I guess the obvious reason
would be for her money.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.575
Any ideas who might benefit most?

12:44.778 --> 12:46.837
I guess the first in line
would be Amy.

12:48.749 --> 12:51.718
I wonder who the second person
would be.

12:51.785 --> 12:54.219
Yeah, good point.

12:57.591 --> 13:00.389
The rendezvous was at the spot
overlooking Hanauma Bay,

13:00.461 --> 13:04.056
which is a place
where royalty used to meet.

13:05.399 --> 13:07.924
Times have changed a little.

13:08.002 --> 13:11.096
Today, I was meeting a blackmailer.

13:25.352 --> 13:29.015
I had been instructed by Agatha
to carry the envelope in my left hand...

13:29.089 --> 13:31.353
and walk toward the wall.

13:31.425 --> 13:34.292
It's terrific.
It's just like in the movies.

14:03.324 --> 14:05.952
You know Agatha Kimball?

14:06.026 --> 14:08.927
She had an accident and couldn't come.
I have the money.

14:10.864 --> 14:13.765
Let me see it.
First the information.

15:56.854 --> 15:59.721
By the time I passed the truck,
the guy was long gone.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.781
And since there were four ways
he could have gone,

16:01.859 --> 16:06.592
I decided to give up on him and go back to the
rendezvous point to get an I.D. on the body.

16:07.765 --> 16:10.996
I was a little late.
I couldn't get an I.D.

16:11.068 --> 16:13.709
But I remembered seeing the logo
on the truck the guy was driving...

16:14.772 --> 16:16.899
Fat Jack's.

16:18.175 --> 16:22.407
Now if I could just stay
one step ahead of the cops.

16:35.226 --> 16:39.026
They're all creeps, Jackie.
I'm sick of going out with creeps.

16:39.096 --> 16:43.055
Then don't go out with creeps anymore.
Get yourself a classy guy.

16:43.134 --> 16:46.900
Guys like that don't wanna go out
with fat girls like me.

16:46.971 --> 16:49.872
Sure they do,
'cause you got inner beauty.

16:49.940 --> 16:52.534
All you got to do is zero in
on the right man.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.573
Bingo.

17:03.487 --> 17:07.423
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Jack? The name's
Fat Jack. That's fat with an "" F."

17:07.491 --> 17:09.482
Well, I'm Tom Magnum with an "" M."

17:09.560 --> 17:12.825
I'm Eunice with anything.
How do you do?

17:12.896 --> 17:16.388
Mr. Jack, I was wondering...
Eunice is my baby sister.

17:16.467 --> 17:19.196
Oh, that's very nice. I was
wondering if you could tell me...

17:19.270 --> 17:21.204
Powder your nose, Eunice.

17:21.271 --> 17:24.935
Mr. Magnum and me,
we got some business to talk over.

17:29.647 --> 17:32.207
Jack?

17:32.283 --> 17:36.549
I met a man this morning who was driving your
truck. I wonder if you could help me with an I.D.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.555
He was a thin, wiry guy.

17:39.623 --> 17:42.649
Frank La Rue. You sure?

17:42.726 --> 17:46.594
He's the only guy who would borrow
my van and not bring it back on time.

17:46.664 --> 17:50.191
Just like now.
He's still not back with it.

17:50.267 --> 17:53.634
Well, Frank La Rue was shot.
He's dead.

17:53.704 --> 17:56.229
For once, he's got a good excuse.

17:58.876 --> 18:02.403
You sure don't seem surprised.
A guy like Frank turning up dead?

18:03.647 --> 18:07.310
No, I'm not surprised.
Is that all?

18:07.384 --> 18:09.579
No, that's not all.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.958
This, uh, real important to you?

18:19.029 --> 18:21.657
It's pretty important, yeah.

18:21.732 --> 18:23.666
You like my Eunice?

18:23.734 --> 18:26.635
Jack, I want the information,

18:26.704 --> 18:28.899
but I'm not gonna marry
your sister for it.

18:28.973 --> 18:32.409
You don't have to marry her.
All you got to do is take her out,

18:32.476 --> 18:35.206
show her a good time,
nuzzle her ear.

18:35.279 --> 18:37.372
Jack, I don't think
I'm her type anyway.

18:37.448 --> 18:40.008
I'm sure she's used
to the fine things, and I'm...

18:40.084 --> 18:43.611
well, I'm usually broke,
I'm kind of sloppy...

18:48.425 --> 18:50.393
Up to you.

18:50.461 --> 18:54.591
However, uh, I do have a friend
that I think would be just perfect for her.

18:54.665 --> 18:56.690
I thought you might.

19:03.841 --> 19:07.777
Fat Jack sent me to La Rue's residence,
if that's what you wanna call it.

19:07.845 --> 19:11.872
According to Jack, La Rue used to run
errands for him when they lived on Maui.

19:11.949 --> 19:15.715
When I asked him what kind of errands,
he just smiled.

19:19.890 --> 19:23.417
Anyway, Jack said La Rue
wasn't very reliable.

19:23.494 --> 19:27.931
He thought he'd gotten rid of him, and then
out of the blue, La Rue turned up on Oahu.

20:05.302 --> 20:09.238
I felt like someone had
just kicked me in the gut.

20:09.306 --> 20:13.970
The last thing I wanted to find was that Amy was
even remotely connected to someone like La Rue.

20:18.182 --> 20:20.412
Tom. Come on in.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.952
Come on. How's Agatha?

20:30.027 --> 20:33.292
She's sleeping. We finally
got her to take a sedative.

20:33.364 --> 20:35.628
I was just about to have a drink.

20:35.699 --> 20:37.963
Though I don't wanna really drink alone.
Would you...

20:38.035 --> 20:40.003
I'll have a drink with you.
Great.

20:40.070 --> 20:43.062
Scotch on the rocks. I know.

20:49.446 --> 20:51.573
Where's Stewart?

20:51.648 --> 20:55.584
He's out trying to finalize some
business deal that he's been working on.

20:55.652 --> 20:58.416
What business is he in anyway?

20:58.489 --> 21:00.957
It's a different one every time
I talk to him.

21:03.293 --> 21:05.352
To reunions.

21:07.698 --> 21:10.826
How'd you and
Stewart meet anyway?

21:10.901 --> 21:14.098
You really wanna talk about Stewart?
Okay.

21:14.171 --> 21:16.366
What do you wanna talk about?

21:18.675 --> 21:21.701
Well, I was thinking that maybe
we could talk about you and me.

21:22.913 --> 21:25.381
There's nothing to say.

21:25.449 --> 21:28.111
I don't know about that.

21:28.185 --> 21:31.177
This morning when I saw you, it brought
back a lot of old feelings for me.

21:31.255 --> 21:33.553
Old feelings?

21:33.624 --> 21:35.683
Then why'd you walk away
a year ago?

21:38.395 --> 21:42.092
Maybe because it just didn't
seem right at the time.

21:44.101 --> 21:46.399
And now that you're married
it does?

21:48.172 --> 21:50.640
That's a little low,
don't you think?

21:50.707 --> 21:53.870
Oh, maybe,
but I don't like to be used.

21:53.944 --> 21:58.813
I suppose you think that all this is just to
get you to tell me why Grandmother hired you?

21:58.882 --> 22:01.612
Mm-hmm. Well, it's not.

22:03.087 --> 22:05.612
It's just that she usually tells me
everything, you know.

22:05.689 --> 22:09.386
And this morning when she chased us
all out of the room,

22:09.460 --> 22:13.021
I naturally assumed that whatever it was,
had to do with me.

22:13.097 --> 22:17.500
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Yes. She's trying to protect you.

22:17.568 --> 22:19.627
From what?

22:21.371 --> 22:23.430
Frank La Rue.

22:28.846 --> 22:30.780
Is this supposed to be him?

22:30.848 --> 22:32.907
You tell me.

22:35.786 --> 22:38.186
Tom, I don't know this man.

22:38.355 --> 22:41.415
He was with the other girl. Um...

22:41.492 --> 22:43.926
Carol. Carol, whatever her name is.

22:43.994 --> 22:47.054
I worked with her for a couple of
weeks years ago. That's funny,

22:47.097 --> 22:50.328
'cause he claims to have some information
about you for a price.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.698
Blackmail, basically.

22:52.769 --> 22:56.466
What kind of information? I don't know.
He was killed before he could say.

22:56.540 --> 22:59.008
Killed? Uh-huh.

22:59.076 --> 23:01.544
Look, uh, I don't know anything
about that. I swear it.

23:01.612 --> 23:05.912
I only met him that one day and I can't
imagine what he could have on me. Amy. Amy!

23:05.949 --> 23:10.113
This man had his picture taken with you,
or your girlfriend, Carol,

23:10.187 --> 23:14.487
and he tries to blackmail your grandmother with some information
he has about you, and you say you know nothing about him?

23:14.558 --> 23:18.654
Why are you doing this to me?
I don't wanna do it, Amy. I don't like it.

23:18.729 --> 23:21.755
It's bad enough that my own grandmother is
paying off people to get information about me...

23:21.832 --> 23:25.393
That's not what she's doing! If she wanted
something, she should have asked me.

23:25.469 --> 23:28.768
I would have told her. She didn't have to go sneaking
around. She's trying to protect you, and so am I.

23:28.839 --> 23:31.330
But you got to tell me the truth.

23:35.245 --> 23:38.112
Not lovers, huh, Magnum?

23:39.983 --> 23:43.851
You are so full of it.
Stewart, it was my fault.

23:43.921 --> 23:45.980
Stewart, it was my...
Would you just...

23:48.992 --> 23:51.984
I deserved one.

23:56.667 --> 23:59.192
Have Agatha call me
when she wakes up.

24:09.346 --> 24:12.281
My jaw hurt a little,
but I deserved it.

24:12.349 --> 24:14.817
Amy stood there and lied to me,

24:14.885 --> 24:19.686
and because of a few tears,
I melted like an ice cube on Waikiki.

24:19.756 --> 24:22.350
Sometimes I really feel stupid.

24:22.426 --> 24:25.156
And this was one of them.

24:28.732 --> 24:31.166
Who's there?

24:31.235 --> 24:33.465
Is that you, Amy?

24:33.537 --> 24:35.903
Who is it?

24:35.973 --> 24:38.168
Stewart.

24:42.179 --> 24:45.080
Is it you, Amy?

24:46.483 --> 24:48.883
Stewart!

25:02.399 --> 25:04.663
I might have known the only reason
you invited me over here...

25:04.735 --> 25:07.966
was just to con me into taking
some friend of yours out.

25:09.506 --> 25:11.770
Ah. I'm not conning you, Rick.

25:11.842 --> 25:15.471
If I was conning you, why would I ask
T.C. along for lunch too, huh? Here.

25:15.545 --> 25:18.742
I don't know why we keep falling for this.
This ain't no lunch.

25:18.815 --> 25:20.874
This is a junk food break.

25:20.951 --> 25:23.749
And the answer is still N-O.

25:23.820 --> 25:26.380
One little date.
What can it hurt?

25:26.456 --> 25:28.788
If it can't hurt anything, then how come
you're not going out with her?

25:28.859 --> 25:31.419
Because she's got a crush
on you, that's why.

25:31.495 --> 25:35.124
She's got a crush on Rick?
What's so funny about that, ya big lug?

25:35.198 --> 25:38.099
She's crazy about him, T.C.

25:38.168 --> 25:40.636
Anyway, I don't trust blind dates.

25:40.704 --> 25:43.070
And neither do I, man.

25:43.140 --> 25:46.940
The last blind date I had made
me wish I was blind. Rick.

25:47.010 --> 25:50.275
This is a relative of a business client.
It's real important.

25:50.347 --> 25:53.748
Sure, I know. And the next thing you're
gonna tell me is that she's a stone ten.

25:53.817 --> 25:56.217
I'm really missing it, right?
I'll tell you what.

25:56.286 --> 25:59.744
I'll make it real easy on you.
Just have one drink with her at the club.

25:59.823 --> 26:01.916
And if it doesn't work out,
I'll take her home.

26:01.992 --> 26:04.119
One drink at the club?
That's right.

26:04.194 --> 26:06.355
And you promise you'll take her home?
Right.

26:06.430 --> 26:09.365
Oh, all right.
Get out of there. I'll do it.

26:09.433 --> 26:12.231
Thanks, pal. You're gonna love it.
She's a great girl.

26:12.302 --> 26:14.964
9:15... Ching's Laundry.

26:15.038 --> 26:18.371
Your shirts have been ready
for two weeks. You still owe 8.50.

26:18.442 --> 26:21.741
10:00... Camera Rentals
wishes to remind you...

26:21.812 --> 26:25.771
that you've exceeded your 30-day trial
period on the tripod by 60 days.

26:25.849 --> 26:30.309
30, the phone company called to verify the
fact that your phone has been disconnected.

26:30.387 --> 26:32.582
I really think I paid that bill, Higgins.

26:32.656 --> 26:37.559
And at 2:30 you received a call from an
hysterical woman who said, "" The rabbit died."

26:43.667 --> 26:47.728
I thought that might get you.
That's really not very funny, Higgins.

26:47.804 --> 26:51.205
No, it isn't funny at all.
These all came on Robin Masters's line.

26:51.274 --> 26:54.004
I can loan you some string
and a couple of tin cans...

26:54.077 --> 26:56.068
till you pay your phone bill.

26:56.146 --> 26:58.546
I paid that bill, T.C.!

26:59.616 --> 27:03.313
Amy? Amy called?
She say what it was about?

27:03.387 --> 27:07.323
Amy? Oh, yes. That was the one who
said something about another accident.

27:07.391 --> 27:10.155
I didn't quite get who or where.

27:12.362 --> 27:14.296
Hey, Higgins, sit down.
Have some lunch.

27:27.077 --> 27:30.171
What... What are you doing here?
Where's Agatha?

27:30.247 --> 27:33.580
I'm out here, Thomas.

27:34.651 --> 27:36.744
Agatha, are you all right?

27:36.820 --> 27:39.254
I got a message from Amy
saying you had another accident.

27:39.322 --> 27:43.622
Amy is too emotional. She makes a
big production out of everything.

27:43.693 --> 27:46.526
She was pushed into
the swimming pool.

27:46.596 --> 27:49.030
I fell into the swimming pool.

27:49.099 --> 27:51.397
I got my chair
too close to the edge.

27:51.468 --> 27:53.868
Agatha, you're not that careless.

27:53.937 --> 27:57.270
Thank you for your editorial
comments, Stewart.

27:57.340 --> 28:00.707
Would you be good enough
to leave the two of us alone?

28:03.513 --> 28:05.504
Thomas?

28:06.616 --> 28:09.710
I want you to push me
around a little.

28:09.786 --> 28:11.777
Okay.

28:16.660 --> 28:20.187
Agatha, what is going on? Hmm?

28:20.263 --> 28:22.322
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, come on!

28:22.399 --> 28:24.458
You fell off the ramp.
You fell into the pool.

28:24.534 --> 28:27.367
You're being blackmailed for information
on Amy, and the blackmailer's killed.

28:27.437 --> 28:30.235
Now what the hell is going on?

28:30.307 --> 28:34.471
So far as I'm concerned, it was my own
carelessness that caused the accident.

28:34.544 --> 28:38.275
What about Frank La Rue's accident?
Who caused that?

28:38.348 --> 28:42.648
He was the fellow with
the enlightening information, wasn't he?

28:42.719 --> 28:44.914
Amy told me about
your conversation.

28:44.988 --> 28:49.391
Did she tell you that I found a photo of
her and another girl taken with La Rue?

28:50.827 --> 28:53.489
Huh?

28:53.563 --> 28:57.465
No, she didn't mention that.

28:57.534 --> 29:00.594
But it doesn't matter
because the man is dead.

29:00.670 --> 29:02.604
And now the whole ordeal is over.

29:02.672 --> 29:04.867
Agatha, it is not over.

29:04.941 --> 29:07.068
Amy is lying to me about La Rue.

29:07.143 --> 29:09.864
And I get the feeling you're not being
totally honest with me either.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.280
Now what is it you two
are trying to protect?

29:13.850 --> 29:17.650
I am trying to protect a relationship
that I hold very dear to me.

29:19.155 --> 29:22.056
Agatha, how can you hold
something dear to you...

29:22.125 --> 29:24.355
when it's based on deception?

29:24.427 --> 29:27.828
That's enough, Thomas.
That's quite enough.

29:27.898 --> 29:30.765
This case is closed.

29:30.834 --> 29:34.531
And this, uh...
this is for your services.

29:34.604 --> 29:37.004
Come on, Agatha! No.

29:38.008 --> 29:42.911
Thank you very much.
And now you may go, Thomas, please.

29:44.514 --> 29:46.846
I'll find my own way back.

29:48.552 --> 29:50.782
Go along, Thomas.

30:06.262 --> 30:09.891
Amy? Amy?

30:10.247 --> 30:12.694
She left a while ago, sir.

30:12.776 --> 30:16.576
Did she say where she was going? She
headed for the yacht harbor, I think.

30:16.646 --> 30:19.046
Is she taking the boat out?
Sorry. I don't know.

30:19.115 --> 30:21.913
Oh. Thanks.

30:29.492 --> 30:31.926
Hey, T.M.
No wonder you're so hard to reach.

30:31.995 --> 30:34.828
T.C., I got to get to Maui.

30:34.898 --> 30:38.163
Can't help you, man.
I got to take the Mitchells...

30:38.234 --> 30:40.168
to Kauai at 3:00.

30:40.236 --> 30:42.602
No, that's great.
That gives us plenty of time.

30:42.672 --> 30:44.902
Plenty of time for what?
I ain't going nowhere.

30:44.975 --> 30:47.068
No, T.C., this is important.

30:47.143 --> 30:50.510
You remember the guy who I
told you was shot? Mm-hmm.

30:50.580 --> 30:53.913
Well, he used to live on Maui, and now I'm
pretty sure Amy's headed over there too.

30:53.984 --> 30:56.748
Amy? That's Agatha
Kimball's granddaughter.

30:56.820 --> 31:01.723
She's the one who said she doesn't know... T.C.,
I'll explain all that after we get going. Come on.

31:01.791 --> 31:04.487
Like I said,
I ain't going nowhere,

31:04.561 --> 31:08.691
unless you got some kind of money...
you know, gas money, something.

31:08.765 --> 31:11.734
Ah, come on, T.C.

31:11.801 --> 31:13.769
No money,

31:13.837 --> 31:16.067
no Maui.

31:16.139 --> 31:19.631
- I bought you lunch.
- Junk food.

31:22.145 --> 31:25.205
There. That's all I got.

31:25.281 --> 31:28.444
That's all I got. Oh.

31:30.787 --> 31:35.224
That's it. You need to take
this to a church somewhere.

31:35.291 --> 31:38.852
Man, I'm talking about real money,
not chump change.

31:38.928 --> 31:42.455
Wait. I do have
a couple hundred here, I think.

31:42.532 --> 31:44.659
I just got paid.

31:48.471 --> 31:52.237
Scooglie-wooglies! Man, where did you get this
from? You didn't do nothing illegal, did you?

31:52.308 --> 31:56.301
No, that's mine!
I've been on a case. This case.

31:56.379 --> 31:58.347
Yeah, well, maybe I better
hold this for you.

31:58.415 --> 32:03.352
We got some past debts that we need
to discuss, um, on our way to Maui.

32:03.420 --> 32:07.447
Shall we go? Wait, T.C. I never counted
that. I thought there was 250 bucks there.

32:07.524 --> 32:10.357
You better bone up on your accounting, boy,
'cause this is a lot of money here.

32:10.427 --> 32:12.725
T.C., how much is there anyway?

32:26.209 --> 32:28.837
Will you hurry up?
I got to get back for my next ride.

32:28.912 --> 32:31.437
Hurry up? There must be
a hundred boats down there.

32:31.514 --> 32:36.247
- Can't you get me a little lower? - If I wanted
to water-ski with this chopper, which I don't.

32:42.892 --> 32:46.487
There it is. Looks empty.

32:50.500 --> 32:54.368
Take me to, uh, uh, uh,
265 Kahului Drive.

32:54.437 --> 32:58.203
- I ain't running no taxi service.
- The gas money, T.C.

33:00.009 --> 33:03.536
You got a map or something?
You know where to find this place?

33:03.613 --> 33:06.844
- We'll ask someone.
- Ask someone?

33:06.916 --> 33:10.545
Boy, I can't...
I just can't believe you.

33:18.628 --> 33:21.756
Let's go. Thomas, I got
customers waiting for me.

33:59.636 --> 34:02.070
All right, just finished here.
I got to go now.

34:02.138 --> 34:04.732
Thanks, T.C. I owe you one.

34:33.603 --> 34:35.594
Hello?

34:40.510 --> 34:42.501
Hello?

34:47.750 --> 34:51.150
What do you want?
You another cop?

34:51.221 --> 34:55.453
No. Excuse me.
Has Amy Kimball been here?

34:55.525 --> 34:59.188
Amy Kimball died two years ago, mister.

35:14.811 --> 35:18.406
Amy Kimball died when she got caught
in a riptide off Lahaina.

35:18.481 --> 35:21.814
Her boyfriend had tried to save her,
but failed.

35:21.885 --> 35:23.978
His name was Frank La Rue.

35:24.053 --> 35:27.784
I knew now why he had called Agatha.
He probably thought $25,000...

35:27.857 --> 35:30.621
was a small price to pay
for exposing a phony.

35:30.693 --> 35:34.322
Unfortunately, for La Rue, he didn't
realize what price he'd have to pay...

35:34.397 --> 35:36.888
to keep the information a secret.

35:40.937 --> 35:42.928
Hello, Carol.

35:44.007 --> 35:46.339
It is Carol, isn't it?

35:48.745 --> 35:50.736
Carol Foster.

35:53.716 --> 35:56.617
Well, how did you know
where to find me?

35:56.686 --> 36:01.385
Oh, there was a girl at La Rue's who
filled me in on some of the highlights.

36:01.457 --> 36:03.448
Amy...

36:07.163 --> 36:10.599
Don't you think it's time
you filled me in on the details?

36:12.535 --> 36:15.129
Amy and I were roommates
for three years.

36:16.806 --> 36:20.640
We shared everything
about our lives, our families.

36:20.710 --> 36:22.735
It was a beautiful friendship.

36:26.783 --> 36:29.616
But something happened to Amy
when her mother died.

36:29.686 --> 36:32.655
She... She just dropped out.

36:32.722 --> 36:36.681
She started taking drugs and
hanging around guys like Frank La Rue.

36:38.528 --> 36:41.292
It was agony for me to watch someone
I loved like a sister...

36:41.364 --> 36:44.094
just self-destruct.

36:44.167 --> 36:47.659
So you decided to take over
where Amy left off?

36:49.105 --> 36:51.437
That's one way of looking at it.

36:56.312 --> 36:58.780
Amy really started going off
the deep end...

36:58.848 --> 37:02.079
at about the time the
you contacted her in Texas.

37:02.151 --> 37:04.676
Then I spoke to the real Amy?

37:04.754 --> 37:07.746
Uh-huh.
The first time you called,

37:07.824 --> 37:09.758
you got Amy.

37:09.826 --> 37:12.852
And then Grandma started to...

37:12.929 --> 37:14.863
I mean, um,

37:14.931 --> 37:17.832
her grandmother started
to write to her,

37:17.900 --> 37:21.734
and Amy was always so strung out
that she couldn't even read the mail.

37:21.804 --> 37:24.932
So, I started reading the letters.

37:26.209 --> 37:29.042
She sounded like
such a wonderful lady.

37:29.112 --> 37:32.639
I got so wrapped up
in those letters that...

37:32.715 --> 37:35.343
I found myself
answering them and...

37:35.418 --> 37:40.014
and pretty soon, I'd... I'd
just become Amy Kimball.

37:42.458 --> 37:45.052
I wanted to tell her.
I wanted to.

37:45.128 --> 37:48.222
And... And I tried, but...

37:48.297 --> 37:52.165
she seemed so happy that she'd
found her granddaughter again.

37:52.235 --> 37:54.430
I just couldn't do it.

37:54.504 --> 37:57.337
I couldn't shatter
her life like that.

37:57.407 --> 37:59.705
And yours.

38:01.044 --> 38:03.035
And mine.

38:04.047 --> 38:08.108
That's the real reason that I didn't
let anything develop between us.

38:08.184 --> 38:10.618
I knew I was a fake.

38:10.686 --> 38:14.053
And what about the inheritance?
The thought of that ever occur to you?

38:14.123 --> 38:16.751
I don't give a damn
about the money.

38:16.826 --> 38:19.989
I love her. I love her as if
she was my own grandmother.

38:20.063 --> 38:23.055
I don't care about the money.
I swear it.

38:23.132 --> 38:25.327
And what about
your grandmother's accidents?

38:25.401 --> 38:29.132
What about them? They're accidents. Then
you're naive, because they aren't accidents.

38:29.205 --> 38:31.400
Somebody wants to kill
your grandmother for her money.

38:31.474 --> 38:33.465
Well, it isn't me.

38:36.112 --> 38:38.239
I know that.

38:41.017 --> 38:43.110
No.

38:43.186 --> 38:46.246
Oh, no. It isn't... It isn't Stewart.

38:46.322 --> 38:49.382
Amy? It isn't. It isn't. Don't say it.
Because...

38:49.459 --> 38:53.327
Look, I know him. I know what he can
do and he couldn't do that. Amy.

38:53.396 --> 38:56.490
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

39:15.751 --> 39:18.447
What are you doing?
I'm gonna call Agatha.

39:24.460 --> 39:27.623
Operator, I'd like to charge this
to my home phone.

39:27.697 --> 39:30.097
It's 555-2131.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.293
My name? It's Robin Masters.

39:40.443 --> 39:44.539
Isn't she answering? Come on.
Let's get back to the boat.

39:58.828 --> 40:01.991
This isn't exactly the fastest way
to travel, but I guess we got no choice.

40:02.064 --> 40:04.055
It's a lot faster than you think.

40:04.133 --> 40:06.067
Stewart!

40:06.135 --> 40:09.229
You should have done what Agatha told you.
You should have taken the money and run.

40:09.305 --> 40:12.399
Because now you can't. Is that
what you plan to do, Stewart?

40:12.475 --> 40:16.172
Uh-huh, yeah. As soon as she finds out
you're not her granddaughter.

40:16.245 --> 40:18.179
You knew?

40:18.247 --> 40:20.943
La Rue came to me first
before he realized that...

40:21.017 --> 40:24.248
Agatha could dish out
a lot more cash than I could.

40:24.320 --> 40:27.289
Come on. Get up. We're gonna take a ride.
Get on the bridge.

40:27.356 --> 40:29.290
You want me to drive, Stewart?

40:29.358 --> 40:31.292
Yeah.

40:40.336 --> 40:42.395
- Stewart, you can't... Ow!
- You just...

40:54.050 --> 40:55.984
just give me the keys.

40:57.820 --> 40:59.754
Okay.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.985
Bye!

41:08.531 --> 41:11.466
Police.! Police.! Call the police.!

41:54.543 --> 41:57.603
Stewart, look out!

41:57.680 --> 42:00.171
Get out of the way.!

42:04.620 --> 42:06.815
Don't...

42:25.308 --> 42:28.004
I just don't see how I can do it,
that's all. I can't.

42:28.077 --> 42:30.511
Amy, we've just been through this.

42:30.579 --> 42:33.639
Now listen to me.
I want you to pull yourself together.

42:33.716 --> 42:37.914
This isn't gonna be nearly
as hard as you think it is.

42:37.987 --> 42:40.512
What if the words
won't come out of my mouth?

42:40.589 --> 42:43.387
They're not supposed to
come out of your mouth.

42:43.459 --> 42:46.451
They're supposed to
come out of your heart.

42:55.504 --> 42:57.495
Okay?

43:01.911 --> 43:03.845
Hey, Thomas.

43:03.913 --> 43:06.040
Hi, Rick. Am I glad
I bumped into you.

43:06.115 --> 43:09.551
Hi, Amy. I want you to meet
Denise, my date for tonight.

43:09.618 --> 43:11.950
Denise?

43:12.021 --> 43:15.855
- I'm Eunice's sister.
- Her sister?

43:15.925 --> 43:19.952
Eunice had root canal work done today
and just didn't feel like going out.

43:21.364 --> 43:23.298
Root canal.

43:24.467 --> 43:28.369
Yeah, well, we're gonna get a couple
of drinks. Boy, can you pick 'em.

43:30.239 --> 43:32.332
What's all that about?

43:33.476 --> 43:35.706
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

43:35.778 --> 43:38.508
Good evening, Amy, Magnum.

43:38.581 --> 43:40.947
Higgins.

43:41.016 --> 43:43.644
Don't you have something
to say to me?

43:44.820 --> 43:47.311
I'm sorry.

43:47.390 --> 43:49.620
For what?

43:49.692 --> 43:51.887
The bill. You paid it.

43:51.961 --> 43:55.658
What bill? The phone bill.

43:55.731 --> 43:58.256
Your phone wasn't disconnected.

43:58.334 --> 44:01.201
And why is that?

44:01.270 --> 44:04.501
The dogs chewed through the wire.

44:04.573 --> 44:08.475
Oh, Higgins, you're really going
to have to give them bones.

44:22.091 --> 44:24.525
Frances. Thank you, Frances.

44:24.593 --> 44:27.585
Who's there?

44:27.663 --> 44:29.654
Amy?

44:30.666 --> 44:32.861
Is it you, Amy?

44:34.437 --> 44:36.837
Thomas? Hi, Agatha.

44:36.906 --> 44:39.033
Hello, Thomas.

44:39.108 --> 44:41.201
Please, come. Sit.

44:42.445 --> 44:44.572
You too, Amy.

44:57.126 --> 44:59.686
Well,

44:59.762 --> 45:03.095
this is one of the most interesting
conversations I've ever heard.

45:09.905 --> 45:12.499
Aren't you going to say
anything at all, Amy?

45:14.877 --> 45:17.004
It's not Amy, Agatha.

45:17.079 --> 45:21.015
I'm Carol. Carol Foster.

45:21.083 --> 45:23.847
Oh, dear.

45:23.919 --> 45:27.286
And I am not your granddaughter.

45:29.058 --> 45:32.186
Well, perhaps not of my blood,

45:33.562 --> 45:36.497
but you are my granddaughter.

45:40.069 --> 45:42.697
You knew I wasn't
your real granddaughter?

45:42.771 --> 45:46.605
I was pretty certain
you weren't my son's real daughter.

45:46.675 --> 45:50.771
You could never play the piano
like a true Kimball.

45:51.780 --> 45:53.645
But...

45:53.716 --> 45:56.116
Oh, believe me, Amy,

45:57.686 --> 46:02.817
you are as important to me
as a granddaughter could ever be.

46:08.430 --> 46:11.763
Why didn't you say anything?

46:13.836 --> 46:18.170
Because all my life I dreamed
about having a granddaughter.

46:18.240 --> 46:20.970
And with you, Amy,
I had finally got one.

46:22.578 --> 46:25.604
And I figured you'd tell me
about it one day.

46:27.182 --> 46:29.878
But even if you hadn't,
it wouldn't matter.

46:29.952 --> 46:34.184
I can take anything you say to me.

46:35.925 --> 46:40.021
Just so long as you never...
say good-bye.

46:41.530 --> 46:44.055
Yes, that's a good girl.

46:44.133 --> 46:46.897
Now, now.

46:46.969 --> 46:49.199
Oh, my, my, my, my, my.

46:49.271 --> 46:51.466
Thomas, are you still here?

46:51.540 --> 46:54.168
Yeah, I'm right here, Agatha.

46:54.243 --> 46:57.007
Well, I think I could do
with a hug from you too.

46:58.247 --> 47:00.238
I can do that.

47:06.655 --> 47:10.182
I'm so glad you never
shaved that off.

47:10.259 --> 47:13.092
Such a beautiful brush.
