00:18.291 --> 00:21.493
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:21.495 --> 00:24.196
- Charlie said I could have her.
- No!

00:24.198 --> 00:27.432
No. No.

00:27.434 --> 00:29.334
Charlie?

00:29.336 --> 00:30.702
- Charlie.
- Yeah. Yeah, what?

00:30.704 --> 00:32.704
Wake up, wake up. We got to get up.

00:32.706 --> 00:34.573
Yeah, I'm...

00:34.575 --> 00:37.509
I'm still here.

00:37.511 --> 00:38.610
Um...

00:40.781 --> 00:42.648
Everything okay?

00:42.650 --> 00:45.350
Yeah, I just, uh, had a nightmare.

00:45.352 --> 00:47.352
Um... anything to do

00:47.354 --> 00:49.488
with what we were talking about?

00:49.490 --> 00:51.056
Where'd that land, anyway?

00:51.058 --> 00:52.925
Oh, well, we're two people
who have a kid,

00:52.927 --> 00:54.793
broke up, got pregnant
with another kid...

00:54.795 --> 00:56.428
- pretty straightforward.
- Ah.

00:56.430 --> 00:58.630
Clear as mud.

00:58.632 --> 01:00.966
The thing is, is I just feel
like every time I turn around,

01:00.968 --> 01:03.001
I'm pushed in a different direction.

01:03.003 --> 01:07.105
Okay, well, let's just
take things slow then.

01:07.107 --> 01:08.273
You focus on the baby,

01:08.275 --> 01:10.976
and we'll keep things stable
for you and Luke.

01:13.246 --> 01:15.747
Um, I'm gonna take off

01:15.749 --> 01:17.649
and see if I can grab
another couple hours sleep

01:17.651 --> 01:20.085
before shift starts.

01:20.087 --> 01:22.087
You sure you're okay?

01:22.089 --> 01:24.189
Yeah, Charlie, I'm fine.

01:24.191 --> 01:25.557
Okay.

01:31.397 --> 01:33.365
Alex, and one more thing.

01:33.367 --> 01:35.968
Mm-hmm.

01:35.970 --> 01:38.470
Thank you...

01:38.472 --> 01:41.473
for the, uh...

01:41.475 --> 01:43.809
talk.

01:43.811 --> 01:45.844
No problem.

01:45.846 --> 01:49.047
Stability, right?

01:49.049 --> 01:50.849
Stability.

02:00.393 --> 02:02.260
I didn't think
this would be so difficult.

02:02.262 --> 02:05.397
Jonathan, do you have Form A15?

02:05.399 --> 02:08.834
Babe, you made it through med school.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.503
I'm pretty sure this is gonna be
a piece of cake.

02:11.505 --> 02:13.839
Thank you. Yes, but intake meetings,

02:13.841 --> 02:17.175
references, police check, home study.

02:17.177 --> 02:18.910
What did you think?

02:18.912 --> 02:21.313
We're adopting a child,
not leasing a car.

02:21.315 --> 02:22.681
But there are so many questions.

02:22.683 --> 02:24.516
Listen. "What age range
would you consider?"

02:24.518 --> 02:25.684
"What gender would you like?"

02:25.686 --> 02:27.719
"Would you consider
a child with disabilities?"

02:27.721 --> 02:28.720
- Would you... 
- You heard the rep.

02:28.722 --> 02:30.055
These are just sample questions

02:30.057 --> 02:34.192
to figure out our motivations
for becoming parents.

02:34.194 --> 02:35.794
Jonathan, you were arrested?

02:35.796 --> 02:38.030
- Jonathan!
- Relax.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.965
It was in high school.

02:39.967 --> 02:41.700
I stole mascara from my girlfriend.

02:41.702 --> 02:43.468
- Girlfriend?
- All right.

02:43.470 --> 02:46.071
You know what? I-I can't do this
with you right now.

02:46.073 --> 02:48.340
All they want is for us
to answer some simple questions.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.876
I don't know why you
have to keep acting so...

02:50.878 --> 02:52.544
"So" what?
How... How am I acting?

02:52.546 --> 02:54.046
Weird.

02:59.419 --> 03:01.420
I'm s...

03:01.422 --> 03:03.288
I didn't mean that. I...

03:06.426 --> 03:08.727
Just... Just shut the door
on your way out.

03:15.636 --> 03:16.902
I'm very flattered.

03:16.904 --> 03:19.237
I'm a great fan of the work
Torbin General does.

03:19.239 --> 03:22.140
And we're excited at
the possibility of having you.

03:22.142 --> 03:24.876
We were thrilled you applied
after your three months with us.

03:24.878 --> 03:28.947
Yes, so was I...
a year ago, when I did that.

03:28.949 --> 03:32.617
I know. I apologize for things
moving so slowly,

03:32.619 --> 03:35.620
but you have to understand
it's a popular position,

03:35.622 --> 03:37.422
one that's still yours if you want it.

03:37.424 --> 03:38.723
Of course I want it.

03:38.725 --> 03:41.860
So, shall I take that as a yes?

03:41.862 --> 03:43.528
Can I have the day

03:43.530 --> 03:46.431
to think about it
and figure out my finances?

03:46.433 --> 03:47.933
I'll let you know tomorrow?

03:47.935 --> 03:50.435
Good enough. Talk soon, Dr. Katz.

03:50.437 --> 03:51.436
- Okay.
- Cheerio.

03:51.438 --> 03:52.671
Thanks.

03:54.674 --> 03:56.541
Covert FaceTime session.

03:56.543 --> 03:58.944
Try and tamp down my paranoia.

03:58.946 --> 04:01.179
It's just my sister, no big deal.

04:01.181 --> 04:03.482
What are you talking about?

04:03.484 --> 04:05.250
Finally patched things up
with your family.

04:05.252 --> 04:06.384
You're back for good.

04:06.386 --> 04:09.187
It's a very big deal,
es-especially to me.

04:11.290 --> 04:13.125
Are you okay?

04:13.127 --> 04:15.994
We need to talk.

04:15.996 --> 04:18.396
E.R. Can you save it for later?

04:18.398 --> 04:20.065
And I can tell you again
how happy I am

04:20.067 --> 04:24.569
to have you back in my life?

04:31.744 --> 04:34.946
Katrina. Didn't recognize you
without your makeup on.

04:34.948 --> 04:37.115
Funny. I'm heading
to the Zombiewalk.

04:37.117 --> 04:39.317
- You done for the day?
- Just finishing the night shift,

04:39.319 --> 04:40.952
which I rocked, by the way.

04:40.954 --> 04:43.321
Ah, karaoke with
the geriatric ward again, huh?

04:43.323 --> 04:44.923
Got to give the people what they want.

04:44.925 --> 04:46.491
Well, have fun. Just remember

04:46.493 --> 04:48.460
the only way to kill the undead is...

04:48.462 --> 04:50.328
to cancel their TV show.

04:50.330 --> 04:53.598
Or a silver bullet,
stake through the heart.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.901
Or you can cut off their head
with an ax.

04:57.970 --> 05:01.907
Um, hello, Blake.

05:01.909 --> 05:03.642
Black, please.

05:03.644 --> 05:06.611
What, uh... Whatcha doing?
Thought you hit the road.

05:06.613 --> 05:09.648
That's the thanks I get
for giving you your space?

05:09.650 --> 05:11.249
You did what again?

05:11.251 --> 05:14.352
You've been avoiding me, Charlie.

05:14.354 --> 05:16.588
I assumed it was 'cause
you and the baby mama

05:16.590 --> 05:18.490
needed some time to grieve.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.825
Oh, Martha's funeral.

05:20.827 --> 05:23.929
Well, then, thank you, I guess.

05:23.931 --> 05:26.131
Thank you for your tact. You're, uh...

05:26.133 --> 05:27.832
You're one hell of a stand-up spirit.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.834
Yes, I seem to recall
you mentioning something

05:29.836 --> 05:32.003
about helping me with that.

05:32.005 --> 05:34.539
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

05:34.541 --> 05:36.942
Thought you, uh, liked
the liminal state, though.

05:36.944 --> 05:39.911
You were, uh, worried
about where you might end up.

05:39.913 --> 05:41.746
Can't be any worse than this place...

05:41.748 --> 05:43.682
Screaming kids, old people.

05:43.684 --> 05:45.550
That.

05:45.552 --> 05:46.918
Uh, I got to go.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.387
Come on, man. I really need
your undivided here, okay?

05:49.389 --> 05:52.757
I'm a surgeon, Blake. The only
dividing I do is with a scalpel.

05:52.759 --> 05:54.993
But I'll help you, I promise.

05:54.995 --> 05:59.097
I just... duty calls. Got to run.

05:59.099 --> 06:01.666
Right, copy that.

06:01.668 --> 06:04.769
Okay, we got three patients
just arrived, all acute trauma.

06:04.771 --> 06:06.838
Car hit a guardrail. Let's look alive.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.874
Here we go.

06:09.876 --> 06:11.142
Maggie, Dev, take stretcher 1.

06:11.144 --> 06:12.444
- Yeah.
- All right.

06:12.446 --> 06:14.179
Let's get the second stretcher
into the trauma bay.

06:14.181 --> 06:16.715
- Check his vitals, Sekara.
- Yeah.

06:16.717 --> 06:18.950
We need O-neg with plenty of ringers.

06:18.952 --> 06:22.087
- Jackson, take the bag.
- Yeah.

06:22.089 --> 06:24.856
Okay, gonna need a FAST over here.

06:28.862 --> 06:30.629
I'm not getting anything.

06:30.631 --> 06:32.097
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

06:32.099 --> 06:33.765
He's gone.

06:33.767 --> 06:35.600
I've got massive internal hemorrhaging.

06:35.602 --> 06:38.370
We're losing him.

06:38.372 --> 06:40.071
All right, talk to me. What have we got?

06:40.073 --> 06:42.173
- Airbag deployed.
- Must've had his feet on the dash

06:42.175 --> 06:44.576
at the point of impact.

06:44.578 --> 06:45.977
Get ready to transfer.

06:45.979 --> 06:47.979
One, two, three.

06:47.981 --> 06:50.081
Wait, wait.

06:50.083 --> 06:51.316
That's me. I'm not...

06:51.318 --> 06:53.251
Let's get pressure on those
wounds. He's bleeding out.

06:53.253 --> 06:54.286
I'm dead?

06:56.290 --> 06:58.723
He's in hemorrhagic shock.
I need O-neg now.

06:58.725 --> 07:02.494
Man: Got it.

07:03.897 --> 07:06.264
Hey, hey.
You can hear us, right?

07:06.266 --> 07:07.732
You can, can't you?

07:07.734 --> 07:08.700
Alex: We're losing him.

07:08.702 --> 07:10.168
You can't let our little brother die.

07:10.170 --> 07:12.604
He's the whole reason we were
in that car in the first place.

07:12.606 --> 07:15.373
If you don't save him, our dad
is never gonna forgive himself.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.609
You brothers?

07:17.611 --> 07:19.511
They're brothers?

07:19.513 --> 07:21.513
Oh, my God.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.949
Hell of a force.
Look at that seatbelt mark.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.484
He's-He's got to have
internal damage.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.019
Compound complex fracture
to the tib, fib.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.787
I want to see if I can get
that shoulder back in.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.257
- Alex, can I use you for counter traction?
- Yep.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.959
We need to get him
up to imaging ASAP.

07:45.497 --> 07:46.464
Okay, he's good to go.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.832
Dr. Williams,
can you prep the O.R.?

07:47.834 --> 07:49.734
We need him there immediately
following the C.T. scan.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.103
Got it.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.571
Get Jackson to notify the family.

07:53.573 --> 07:56.874
We've already lost two of them.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.643
Your blood pressure's low,

07:58.645 --> 08:00.111
but that can happen with pregnancy.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.812
Other than that, everything looks good.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.382
I don't think your fall on
the sidewalk affected anything.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.616
Two left feet.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.985
I don't even know why
I'm still dressing up for this.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.388
Even I'm starting to think
I'm a little old for it.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.290
It says here you had
some trouble conceiving?

08:12.292 --> 08:13.925
That's putting it mildly.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.827
Five rounds of IVF
before I finally got pregnant.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.696
Cost me everything I had.

08:18.698 --> 08:19.997
Well, congratulations.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.799
You and your partner
must be thrilled.

08:21.801 --> 08:25.536
He is, as is his new
modern dancer girlfriend.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.504
Ah.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.206
We split after 13 years

08:29.208 --> 08:31.842
when it finally clicked
we didn't want the same things.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.077
Kids.

08:33.078 --> 08:36.113
13 years, and you started over
just like that?

08:36.115 --> 08:38.616
Oh, starting over's
the easy part.

08:38.618 --> 08:40.784
Hard part's leaving.

08:40.787 --> 08:44.889
But you got to decide
what you want most.

08:44.891 --> 08:47.224
I just need you
to sign your release form,

08:47.226 --> 08:48.392
and then you can go.

08:48.394 --> 08:49.694
Okay.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.295
Right there.

08:53.765 --> 08:55.433
Something wrong?

08:55.435 --> 08:57.835
Yeah. Uh...

08:57.837 --> 09:00.104
I-I don't remember
how to sign my name.

09:02.775 --> 09:06.243
Dr. Lin, the nosebleed
in cubicle 3,

09:06.245 --> 09:09.080
- he's starting to get restless.
- I'm on it.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.247
Yeah.

09:15.253 --> 09:17.154
I know you have
a hell of a busy nightlife,

09:17.156 --> 09:18.255
but in case you forgot,

09:18.257 --> 09:19.857
people enter here
in dire situations,

09:19.859 --> 09:22.426
and we kind of need you to be... 
I don't know... awake.

09:22.428 --> 09:23.661
I'm sorry.

09:23.663 --> 09:24.962
I'm exhausted.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.864
I've been spending every night
at Sydney's,

09:26.866 --> 09:30.935
and her tiny, little hobbit bed
is just so hobbity.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.737
So why don't you and Sydney
buy a bigger bed,

09:32.739 --> 09:34.772
something more orc-sized.

09:34.774 --> 09:35.906
We're not buying a bed.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.343
Why not? You and Sydney
basically live together.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.911
Oh, I get it.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.080
It's because you guys aren't
really that serious, right?

09:43.082 --> 09:45.583
Exactly. We're just... 
We're just keeping it loose.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.585
- Wrong. You want to know why?
- Mm-hmm.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.953
Because sleeping over every night

09:48.955 --> 09:51.589
means that you are serious,
very serious.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.858
Seriously. I'm serious.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.960
Cereal.

09:55.962 --> 09:57.795
You weren't expecting
that last one, were you?

09:57.797 --> 09:59.163
You're a child.

09:59.165 --> 10:00.498
Can't hide from the truth, Lin.

10:00.500 --> 10:04.568
You guys are in a serious relationship.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.871
Sekara, Scott.

10:06.873 --> 10:09.440
Deal with that mustache.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.808
Go.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.480
Alex: Dr. Williams?

10:16.482 --> 10:19.450
Just tying off the abdominal bleed now.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.953
I thought Dr. Harris
was going to be joining us.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.422
He is.

10:27.793 --> 10:31.762
All right, let me get in there,
have a look.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.230
That is not good.

10:33.232 --> 10:35.833
Bowel must have perforated
on impact.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.068
Needle driver.

10:39.571 --> 10:42.339
Charlie, we gonna do this or what?

10:42.341 --> 10:44.275
I'm kind of in the middle
of something important,

10:44.277 --> 10:47.378
in case you hadn't noticed.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.579
How come when I was in a coma,

10:48.581 --> 10:51.415
you never came in to look in
on me before I croaked?

10:51.417 --> 10:53.050
I don't know, Blake.
Maybe that's because

10:53.052 --> 10:55.519
you weren't my patient.
We'll talk when I get back.

11:02.027 --> 11:03.394
How'd you do that?

11:17.676 --> 11:20.544
You okay?

11:20.546 --> 11:23.514
Uh, yeah. Just got held up.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.149
How's our patient doing?

11:25.151 --> 11:27.718
He's hemodynamically stable.
Blood gases are okay.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.520
And we seem to be
controlling the bleeding.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.155
Branch of the superior
mesenteric vein.

11:31.157 --> 11:32.289
We've already tied it off.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.592
Working on the tear in the bowel.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.127
How's the leg?

11:36.129 --> 11:38.295
Uh, tibia's broken in two places.

11:38.297 --> 11:39.764
I'm gonna need plates and screw...

11:39.766 --> 11:40.831
Oh.

11:42.468 --> 11:43.768
Oh, you're right, Charlie.

11:43.770 --> 11:46.170
I think I will stick around for a while.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.441
You sure you're okay?

11:50.443 --> 11:51.575
Never better.

11:53.612 --> 11:58.048
You have a rapidly expanding
acute subdural hematoma.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.184
The right side of your brain
is swelling.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.452
Swelling how?

12:01.454 --> 12:04.088
Like it's gonna bust through my skull?

12:04.090 --> 12:06.824
No, I wouldn't use those words.
The skull is hard.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.626
Therefore, the hematoma
can push the brain

12:08.628 --> 12:11.028
down into the spinal column,
and we don't want that.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.863
When you fell,
you must have hit your head.

12:12.865 --> 12:15.065
- Do you remember that?
- Uh, I don't know.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.868
I-I stepped off the curb
and went down.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.304
I was so focused on the

12:20.306 --> 12:22.506
ba... by.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.909
Okay, okay. Okay, we need to
get you into an operating room

12:24.911 --> 12:26.644
right away. I need to open the skull,

12:26.646 --> 12:28.979
remove the hematoma, and then
release some of the pressure.

12:28.981 --> 12:29.999
- Okay?
- Okay, Dr. Hamza,

12:29.999 --> 12:31.017
I just need a moment with you.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.583
And, Trudy, lay back.
One second.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.751
Okay.

12:36.688 --> 12:38.522
- Hmm?
- She's 23 weeks pregnant.

12:38.524 --> 12:39.857
Anesthetic alone
increases the risk

12:39.859 --> 12:41.192
of spontaneous miscarriages,

12:41.194 --> 12:43.394
not to mention the risks of
infection, seizure, blood clots.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.830
Yes, I know this, but if we don't
get her into surgery right away,

12:45.832 --> 12:48.365
we won't have the privilege
of worrying about the baby.

12:50.902 --> 12:53.337
So, you really
don't remember anything.

12:53.339 --> 12:56.240
All I know is that I woke up
in a heap on the sidewalk

12:56.242 --> 12:58.175
surrounded by monsters.

12:58.177 --> 13:01.545
- I'm sorry. Monsters?
- He's talking about Zombiewalk.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.180
Must have been
a primo buzz kill, huh,

13:03.182 --> 13:04.949
waking up in the middle
of that gore-fest?

13:04.951 --> 13:07.384
Buzz kill? Are you implying
that I'm a drug user?

13:07.386 --> 13:08.953
Is he implying that I'm a drug user?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.955
It's just something we need to ask.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.389
Doesn't have to be illegal drugs.

13:12.391 --> 13:14.358
Sometimes, medication
can act against each other.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.961
Okay, I don't take anything, okay?
I just...

13:16.963 --> 13:19.230
I-I can't even have a cup
of coffee without feeling sick.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.365
Yeah, okay, can you raise
your arms for me?

13:21.367 --> 13:22.633
Thank you.

13:27.439 --> 13:28.572
Sekara, we got a problem.

13:28.574 --> 13:30.207
I can't find the source of the bleed.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.209
So, is that fake blood
from the Zombiewalk?

13:32.211 --> 13:33.544
No, no, no.
It's definitely real.

13:33.546 --> 13:37.548
The question is,
if it's not his, whose is it?

13:42.821 --> 13:44.221
- Dr. Hamza?
- Go.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.789
We have an issue with the bone bank.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.925
Apparently, we're still waiting
for it to be up and running.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.261
The skull flap could be unusable
if we can't freeze it.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.263
Where's the closest alternative?

13:52.265 --> 13:54.465
Victoria Mercy. It's too far away.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.799
The bone flap won't make it.

13:55.801 --> 13:58.569
Are you familiar with the work
of Dr. Hillinger?

13:58.571 --> 13:59.803
He believed storing bone flaps

13:59.805 --> 14:01.372
in the subcutaneous fat of the abdomen

14:01.374 --> 14:03.073
is an effective way
to keep them nourished.

14:03.075 --> 14:06.176
You're proposing we put
Trudy's skull into her abdomen?

14:06.178 --> 14:08.379
- It's actually quite common.
- Have you ever seen it done

14:08.381 --> 14:10.247
on a patient
who was 23 weeks pregnant?

14:10.249 --> 14:12.549
We have a small window
to save this patient's life.

14:12.551 --> 14:14.118
If you have a time-efficient alternative

14:14.120 --> 14:17.454
to store this bone flap and
preserve it, then I'm all ears.

14:19.758 --> 14:23.260
Okay, Mr. Dolson, I have veal
sandwich from Papa Alfredo's

14:23.262 --> 14:24.695
I've been wanting to eat all morning.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.063
So let's make this quick, shall we?

14:26.065 --> 14:28.465
I told you I don't remember.

14:28.467 --> 14:30.067
That might work
with Cagney and Lacey here,

14:30.069 --> 14:31.702
but I've been around the block
a few times,

14:31.704 --> 14:33.003
and I'm not buying it.

14:33.005 --> 14:34.505
Neither are the cops when I call them.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.640
- Whoa, okay.
- Which I'm gonna do now.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.175
Okay, w...  wait.

14:38.177 --> 14:39.610
- I'm dialing.
- Give me a second

14:39.612 --> 14:40.945
to get my bearings, okay?

14:40.947 --> 14:42.680
Don't you think I want to know
what happened

14:42.682 --> 14:45.249
- just as much as you do?
- I don't know. Do you?

14:45.251 --> 14:46.917
Zach, may I speak with you
for a second?

14:46.919 --> 14:49.186
Kind of in the middle of losing
game of Clue here, Lin.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.021
I think I might be able
to help with that.

14:54.359 --> 14:57.094
Look what you did to me, freak.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.129
Whoa, wait. You two know each other?

14:59.131 --> 15:00.364
Apparently, they're roommates.

15:00.366 --> 15:01.765
Yeah, he's the one that did this.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.767
- What?!
- Get ready to die, bro.

15:03.769 --> 15:04.969
- Whoa.
- Okay, calm down, Niles.

15:04.971 --> 15:06.704
- No, no, no, no.
- Niles, is that your name? Niles?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.472
Niles, listen, I'm just gonna
give you a little...

15:08.474 --> 15:09.707
- Boop.
- Ohh!

15:09.709 --> 15:12.576
Aah! Ohh!

15:12.578 --> 15:14.244
- Boop?
- Just a little.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.512
Oh.

15:22.988 --> 15:25.823
Cassie, can you retract
the spleen, please?

15:25.825 --> 15:27.624
No problem. I've got it.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.734
Roxy: Looks like we have a ghost.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.769
Can we get more sterilized tools now?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.304
You know what? I'm-I'm sorry.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.373
Dr. Harris, I w... 
I wasn't gonna say anything,

15:42.375 --> 15:45.476
- but I have to speak up.
- Go ahead, Cassie.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.244
We've got to get
the HVAC fixed in here.

15:47.246 --> 15:49.613
It's wreaking havoc. And I know
that you're Chief of Surgery,

15:49.615 --> 15:51.115
and I don't mean
to be bossy, but...

15:51.117 --> 15:53.350
No, it's... that's a good idea.

15:53.352 --> 15:55.352
Hmm.

15:55.354 --> 15:58.088
HVAC aside, is there anything
that I... we need

15:58.090 --> 16:01.191
to be concerned about,
as pertains to the patient?

16:01.193 --> 16:05.162
Um... can't be 100% sure.

16:05.164 --> 16:08.332
Uh, can't exactly talk to the patient.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.800
Right.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.301
How's the patient now, Roxy?

16:11.303 --> 16:13.203
Roxy: Looks good from where I sit.

16:13.205 --> 16:15.205
Looks good from where I sit, too, Doc.

16:15.207 --> 16:17.241
- Spoke too soon.
- Damn it.

16:17.243 --> 16:19.343
The diaphragm has ruptured.
I can't ventilate him.

16:19.345 --> 16:21.245
- He's suffocating.
- We've got to fix this tear.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.280
I need sutures, and we're gonna
need a chest tube.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.615
How's that leg going, Charlie?

16:24.617 --> 16:26.583
Uh...

16:26.585 --> 16:28.185
I'm done.

16:28.187 --> 16:32.056
Somebody close for me.
Stepping out.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.308
Sorry, I don't know how I missed
the diaphragm tear on the C.T.

16:38.310 --> 16:40.844
He had massive injuries
in his belly. It happens.

16:40.846 --> 16:42.445
It's no excuse.

16:42.447 --> 16:43.980
He's coming back up.

16:43.982 --> 16:46.716
Right.

16:46.718 --> 16:49.753
Cassie, shake it off.

16:49.755 --> 16:51.721
We got the stomach down.
Let's anchor it.

16:51.723 --> 16:54.157
2-0 silk, suture.

16:54.159 --> 16:57.494
Ugh, this guy had a full lunch.

16:57.496 --> 17:00.230
Someone get Dr. Williams a gastro tube.

17:00.232 --> 17:01.564
Knife.

17:06.604 --> 17:09.271
There you have it.

17:09.273 --> 17:12.876
Okay, securing gastrostomy tube.

17:15.613 --> 17:17.113
Almost done.

17:21.685 --> 17:23.720
That's it. Looks like
we're out of the woods.

17:23.722 --> 17:24.988
Good job, Cassie.

17:24.990 --> 17:27.089
Thanks for not reaming me out.

17:27.092 --> 17:28.358
Hey, we get to tell a father

17:28.359 --> 17:31.227
that his one remaining son
is still alive.

17:31.229 --> 17:33.463
That is all that matters to me
right now.

17:37.335 --> 17:39.669
Is he in there, my boy, Ezra?

17:39.671 --> 17:41.971
You must be Mr. Town.
I am Dr. Reid. Let's...

17:41.973 --> 17:43.907
Let's find you somewhere private
that we can talk, okay?

17:43.909 --> 17:45.942
Just answer the damn question.
Is he in there?

17:45.944 --> 17:47.310
Yes. Yes, he is, okay?

17:47.312 --> 17:49.446
Now, your son was pretty
banged up from the accident,

17:49.448 --> 17:50.480
but the surgery's gone well,

17:50.482 --> 17:52.082
and we are expecting a full recovery.

17:52.084 --> 17:53.550
And what about, uh, Kieran

17:53.552 --> 17:57.087
and-and, uh... and Isaac?

17:57.089 --> 17:58.421
I am so sorry.

17:58.423 --> 18:01.024
Sir, somebody was supposed
to have-have told you.

18:01.026 --> 18:03.526
What? That they're dead?

18:03.528 --> 18:04.661
Yes, they told me.

18:04.663 --> 18:06.129
But that-that... 
that doesn't matter.

18:06.131 --> 18:08.231
I-I need to see them.

18:08.233 --> 18:11.401
I need to s-see them now.

18:11.403 --> 18:12.502
Have you been drinking?

18:12.504 --> 18:14.704
What-What does that
got to do with anything?

18:14.706 --> 18:18.041
Okay. Let's-Let's just
get you a cup of coffee, okay?

18:18.043 --> 18:20.310
Let's just start there.

18:20.312 --> 18:23.213
Come on. Let's go.

18:23.215 --> 18:24.280
This doesn't make any sense.

18:24.282 --> 18:26.416
I wouldn't just attack you
for no reason.

18:26.418 --> 18:28.385
Oh, yeah, unless you were pissed
about how I left the kitchen.

18:28.387 --> 18:30.220
- I leave crumbs, right, bro?
- Yeah.

18:30.222 --> 18:31.654
He works nights,
I work days.

18:31.656 --> 18:34.224
I come home for lunch every day
for a protein shake.

18:34.226 --> 18:36.426
50% whey,
little bit of soy milk,

18:36.428 --> 18:39.362
glutamine for the boys.

18:39.364 --> 18:41.030
I'm starting to get
why you punched him.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.466
But this morning, I come home,
Bart's sleeping on the couch.

18:43.468 --> 18:46.369
He gets up, freaks out,
and punches me in the face.

18:46.371 --> 18:47.837
Completely unprovoked.

18:47.839 --> 18:50.240
- Bart, how much do you weigh?
- 130 pounds.

18:50.242 --> 18:51.474
And, Niles?

18:51.476 --> 18:54.110
260. But that's lean muscle.

18:54.112 --> 18:56.746
I'm like 10% body fat.

18:58.016 --> 18:59.349
I know, I know, I could be better,

18:59.351 --> 19:02.786
but, uh, I got a sweet tooth.

19:02.788 --> 19:04.287
Excuse us.

19:05.624 --> 19:06.956
What do you think?

19:06.958 --> 19:10.927
He's lying. Nobody's 10% body fat.

19:10.929 --> 19:12.996
Maggie, it doesn't matter what I think,

19:12.998 --> 19:15.598
because no matter how you cut
it, it's a domestic dispute.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.301
But why would tiny Bart
attack giant Niles?

19:18.303 --> 19:20.003
It makes no sense.

19:20.005 --> 19:23.306
Maybe Bart doesn't like
Niles' tiny hobbit bed.

19:23.308 --> 19:25.475
I don't care. It's not
my problem to figure out.

19:25.477 --> 19:27.477
- I'm calling.
- Okay.

19:27.479 --> 19:30.547
Lin, I'm sorry about what I said
about the hobbit bed.

19:30.549 --> 19:33.116
I didn't mean that you and Katz
are like those two goons.

19:33.118 --> 19:34.717
No, we're not. And we won't be,

19:34.719 --> 19:37.620
- 'cause we don't live together.
- Yes, you do.

19:37.622 --> 19:38.655
- No, we don't.
- Yes...

19:38.657 --> 19:41.658
Hi. I would like to report an incident.

19:41.660 --> 19:42.792
Hope Zion.

19:44.728 --> 19:46.162
Mr. Town?

19:49.967 --> 19:51.634
Can't Irish this up, huh?

19:51.636 --> 19:55.238
No. And even if I could...

19:55.240 --> 19:56.272
Listen, there's a chapel.

19:56.274 --> 19:57.440
There's somebody you could talk to.

19:57.442 --> 19:58.842
I could arrange it if you'd like.

19:58.844 --> 20:02.145
Done enough talking in church
basements about problems.

20:04.648 --> 20:06.316
Listen, why don't we have a seat,

20:06.318 --> 20:09.452
and you can have a drink of that?

20:09.454 --> 20:12.722
Bet now you know why
they were driving so fast, huh?

20:12.724 --> 20:14.991
Get away from me.

20:14.993 --> 20:16.759
I'm sorry.

20:16.761 --> 20:21.197
We don't have to talk about this
right now if you don't want to.

20:21.199 --> 20:24.200
You know, Ezra was, uh...

20:24.202 --> 20:26.469
the only one left,

20:26.471 --> 20:29.239
after the other two, uh,

20:29.241 --> 20:32.542
flew the coop.

20:32.544 --> 20:34.377
And then they just...

20:34.379 --> 20:38.948
they just had to
stick their noses in,

20:38.950 --> 20:41.584
try to take him from me.

20:41.586 --> 20:43.052
And so you fought,
and they left.

20:43.054 --> 20:44.921
Mm-hmm.

20:44.923 --> 20:46.956
- Need to see my boys.
- Um, okay. Uh, you know what?

20:46.958 --> 20:49.192
I know that you do, but you need
to calm down right now.

20:49.194 --> 20:50.260
You're too upset.

20:50.262 --> 20:52.328
You don't know a damn thing about me.

20:52.330 --> 20:54.864
Okay, I'm sorry. You're right, I don't.

20:54.866 --> 20:56.566
But I-I do know something
about drinking.

20:56.568 --> 20:58.101
I have been around it my whole life.

20:58.103 --> 20:59.702
And whatever you're feeling right now,

20:59.704 --> 21:01.638
if you don't deal with this,
it's gonna be nothing

21:01.640 --> 21:02.906
compared to how awful you feel

21:02.908 --> 21:05.675
when you sober up tomorrow
and realize that they're gone.

21:09.747 --> 21:11.681
Mr. Town, this is one of the last times

21:11.683 --> 21:15.118
that you get to see the boys.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.120
Don't you want to remember it?

21:21.226 --> 21:23.359
That kid could've died
back there. You get that?

21:23.361 --> 21:25.361
Oh.

21:25.363 --> 21:27.397
It was a joke.

21:27.399 --> 21:30.333
How was I supposed to know he
was going to fish out like that?

21:30.335 --> 21:31.834
You sat on his chest.

21:31.836 --> 21:34.137
Hey, news flash, old man.

21:34.139 --> 21:36.406
- I'm a ghost.
- No.

21:36.408 --> 21:38.575
See, right before
I walked in that O.R.,

21:38.577 --> 21:40.009
you grabbed my arm.

21:40.011 --> 21:42.478
- How'd you do that?
- Well, guess it looks like

21:42.480 --> 21:45.181
you don't know as much
as you think you do.

21:45.183 --> 21:47.917
Well, you seem to be the expert,
so why don't you tell me?

21:50.956 --> 21:52.021
Blake!

21:52.023 --> 21:53.456
- Pshew.
- Okay, okay.

21:53.458 --> 21:55.592
Enough, okay?

21:55.594 --> 21:57.760
You want to leave, all right?

21:57.762 --> 21:59.729
- Let's do that.
- Let's, uh... Let's get you gone.

21:59.731 --> 22:01.064
What, now?

22:01.066 --> 22:04.300
No way. I'm just starting to
figure out how to have fun here.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.209
Wow.

22:13.211 --> 22:14.877
Kind of makes you think, doesn't it?

22:14.879 --> 22:16.579
One day, we just run out of ink,

22:16.581 --> 22:19.182
and someone throws us in a drawer.

22:25.990 --> 22:29.425
You are not staying here.
I won't let you.

22:29.427 --> 22:31.728
Maybe I'm supposed to stay here.

22:31.730 --> 22:33.496
Yeah, and do what, huh?
Move stuff around?

22:33.498 --> 22:34.797
You gonna scare people?

22:34.799 --> 22:36.532
- You're scared?
- Oh, no.

22:36.534 --> 22:38.601
I'm not scared.

22:38.603 --> 22:40.069
Bye, Charlie.

22:44.541 --> 22:46.242
Blake.

22:46.244 --> 22:47.777
Blake?

22:54.818 --> 22:56.319
Who's Blake?

22:59.256 --> 23:01.057
Hey, sorry. I just got your text.

23:01.059 --> 23:02.959
I was in surgery.

23:02.961 --> 23:04.827
I'm happy to help wherever I can.

23:04.829 --> 23:06.763
Great. Can you grab,
uh, sutures and gauze,

23:06.765 --> 23:08.364
and we'll, um, finish this?

23:08.366 --> 23:09.432
Yeah.

23:14.138 --> 23:17.206
Charlie, who's Blake?
What does he want?

23:17.208 --> 23:19.542
I don't know. I don't know.

23:23.514 --> 23:26.949
All right. Um...

23:26.951 --> 23:29.686
Well,

23:29.688 --> 23:33.289
Ezra's father would like
to look at his other sons,

23:33.291 --> 23:38.094
so I have to make them
as presentable as possible.

23:38.096 --> 23:39.662
Do you need my help?

23:39.664 --> 23:40.897
No.

23:50.574 --> 23:52.508
Hey, where's security?
I thought you called them.

23:52.510 --> 23:55.211
I did, but, you know, who falls asleep

23:55.213 --> 23:56.913
while waiting for the cops
to arrest them?

23:56.915 --> 23:58.247
We need to rule out concussion.

23:58.249 --> 23:59.615
Duh. I was just about to do that

23:59.617 --> 24:01.517
before you so rudely interrupted me.

24:01.519 --> 24:03.286
Uh, maybe wait for the cops.

24:03.288 --> 24:05.688
You do remember he came in here
covered in someone else's blood.

24:07.892 --> 24:09.058
Yo.

24:09.060 --> 24:12.061
Bartholomew. Wakey-wakey, friend.

24:12.063 --> 24:13.196
Whoa.

24:13.198 --> 24:15.732
Everybody down!
This place is gonna blow!

24:15.734 --> 24:17.266
- Somebody quick.
- Call security.

24:17.268 --> 24:19.802
- I thought you called security.
- Call them again!

24:19.804 --> 24:22.839
I need somebody to knock this guy out.

24:22.841 --> 24:25.441
I don't think we need to do that, Billy.

24:25.443 --> 24:27.343
He's already asleep.

24:29.467 --> 24:32.369
Dev! How we doing on the help?

24:32.371 --> 24:34.738
- RBD...
- R.E.M. sleep behavior disorder.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.339
Which means Bart
may not have been lying

24:36.341 --> 24:37.641
about not remembering anything.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.009
Right.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.244
Scott, we're gonna be there.
Just give us a second.

24:41.246 --> 24:42.579
Yeah, no problem.

24:42.581 --> 24:44.314
Jackson's still looking for security.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.650
And you still haven't woken him up?

24:46.652 --> 24:48.585
No, it could spook him
and make him more violent.

24:48.587 --> 24:50.654
We're gonna tranq him first. Clonazepam,

24:50.656 --> 24:53.757
44 megs right in the butt.
Be strong.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.492
- Wait, what? Me?
- I found him!

24:55.494 --> 24:57.561
- Somebody call the police!
- Wait, why am I doing it?

24:57.563 --> 24:59.229
- Good luck.
- Listen, Sekara, I didn't want

24:59.231 --> 25:01.398
to have to tell you this,
but evaluations are upcoming,

25:01.400 --> 25:03.366
and your paperwork
is iffy at best.

25:03.368 --> 25:05.969
Or at least it will be
when I'm done with it.

25:05.971 --> 25:07.471
Bart: He's got the whole place rigged!

25:07.473 --> 25:09.272
Just give me the syringe.

25:12.978 --> 25:14.211
Stay back!

25:14.213 --> 25:15.245
Ohh!

25:18.617 --> 25:20.951
Bad news is I couldn't find security.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.186
Good news... found this in their locker.

25:25.657 --> 25:29.159
- Yeah, or we could just do that.
- Yeah.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.027
Jackson! There you are.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.963
Here's that file
on Blake Mitchell you asked for.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.798
You know he's deceased, right?

25:34.800 --> 25:36.566
Yeah, I know that, but, um,

25:36.568 --> 25:39.436
some patients are harder
to shake than others.

25:39.438 --> 25:42.205
Mm.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.007
Is that a stun gun?

25:51.350 --> 25:53.116
Yeah, today's weird.

25:57.722 --> 25:58.755
You okay?

25:58.757 --> 26:00.090
Huh? Oh, yeah.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.025
Just a little tired.

26:02.027 --> 26:03.527
Maybe we should take a break.

26:03.529 --> 26:06.029
I'm fine.

26:06.031 --> 26:08.965
Can I have, uh... 
Can I have some gauze, please?

26:08.967 --> 26:12.469
I can finish them on my own.

26:12.471 --> 26:17.007
Can we just get through this, please?

26:17.009 --> 26:18.141
You're crying.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.043
No, Dr. Williams,

26:20.045 --> 26:22.679
I am not crying.

26:22.681 --> 26:25.081
I'm not.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.052
Okay, so what if I am?

26:29.054 --> 26:30.253
Aren't I allowed to?

26:30.255 --> 26:34.357
They're dead. She's dead.
Everybody's dead.

26:34.359 --> 26:36.860
You know what? Don't bother. I know...

26:36.862 --> 26:40.363
I know how ridiculous I sound right now.

26:40.365 --> 26:43.667
Why don't we... sit?

26:43.669 --> 26:44.801
Let's sit.

26:44.803 --> 26:47.037
Why? So you can give me
some kind of pep talk,

26:47.039 --> 26:48.238
some long-winded advice

26:48.240 --> 26:51.107
about how I'm not processing
my mother's death?

26:51.109 --> 26:53.577
That's what everybody thinks, right?

26:53.579 --> 26:54.611
No.

26:54.613 --> 26:58.348
We're... just sitting.

26:58.350 --> 27:01.151
Okay, yeah, let's-let's...
let's do that.

27:03.554 --> 27:07.223
We're doing it.

27:09.995 --> 27:11.962
I'm getting ready to place
the calvarial bone flap

27:11.964 --> 27:15.532
inside the abdominal pocket.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.436
Uh, just give me a second

27:19.438 --> 27:20.971
to find out what the hell is going on.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.340
Get me 75 mics of ritodrine.
It's the baby.

27:23.342 --> 27:24.774
Trudy's having contractions.

27:24.776 --> 27:26.209
- She's in labor?
- I'm trying to stop it.

27:26.211 --> 27:28.078
I don't know about you,
but I'm not really in the mood

27:28.080 --> 27:29.779
to do an emergency
C-section here.

27:29.781 --> 27:32.549
- Talk to me, Dr. Katz.
- Give me another 50 mics.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.184
We've only cut
into the subcutaneous fat,

27:34.186 --> 27:35.452
and her levels
have been fine.

27:35.454 --> 27:38.021
Like I said,
nothing about babies is easy.

27:40.859 --> 27:43.827
No. Are we hitting her again, or...

27:43.829 --> 27:46.162
Yes, hit her again, another 25 mics.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.364
Come on, Trudy.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.300
You fought so hard. Don't give up now.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.836
- Okay, it's not working.
- Just give it a second.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.271
She can't handle more. Wait.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.307
Oh, come on.

27:57.309 --> 28:00.577
Come on, Trudy.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.313
Okay, hold up. She's coming down.

28:03.315 --> 28:04.981
The contractions are spacing out.

28:04.983 --> 28:07.851
The only other thing
I know about babies...

28:07.853 --> 28:10.186
They are always miracles.

28:16.227 --> 28:17.994
What do I do?

28:20.431 --> 28:22.399
Tell them how you feel.

28:33.110 --> 28:36.379
You boys look like crap,
you know that?

28:36.381 --> 28:38.148
But you got nothing
on the old man.

28:38.150 --> 28:41.251
I am the king of the crap house.

28:48.225 --> 28:49.926
I messed up.

28:51.996 --> 28:54.164
I didn't mean to,

28:54.166 --> 28:55.699
but I did.

28:58.969 --> 29:02.038
Ezzie was right to call you.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.307
It should be me lying here, not you.

29:08.579 --> 29:10.814
You're my good boys.

29:14.352 --> 29:17.587
I should have been better for you.

29:17.589 --> 29:21.024
I-I should have been.

29:21.026 --> 29:25.361
And-And I'm sorry.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.931
I'm-I'm sorry.

29:35.981 --> 29:38.683
Blake: Still stalking me, Charlie?

29:38.685 --> 29:42.720
Well, to be honest, you're not a
difficult spirit to track down.

29:42.722 --> 29:45.189
Just need to follow the path
of chaos and confusion.

29:45.191 --> 29:47.658
Oh, I'm having fun.

29:47.660 --> 29:48.759
Yeah?

29:52.798 --> 29:55.366
- What's that?
- That's a hospital file.

29:55.368 --> 29:56.901
Yours.

29:56.903 --> 30:01.072
Do you want to, uh, have a little read?

30:01.074 --> 30:03.507
No, just give me the CliffNotes.

30:03.509 --> 30:05.142
Mm.

30:05.144 --> 30:08.346
Well, let's see. The, uh, first entry

30:08.348 --> 30:11.282
is from when you were 5.

30:11.284 --> 30:12.950
Little boy who fell down a lot...

30:12.952 --> 30:14.352
Least that's what your folks said.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.721
Yeah, I was a... I was a stinker.

30:16.723 --> 30:18.089
Mm-hmm.

30:18.091 --> 30:20.558
Hairline fracture
from falling out of a tree.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.460
Broken arm from basketball.

30:22.462 --> 30:23.861
Broken nose from chasing a...

30:23.863 --> 30:26.063
Cat down the stairs.

30:26.065 --> 30:28.499
I tripped.

30:28.501 --> 30:31.168
Cat had a mean left hook.

30:31.170 --> 30:33.504
Don't... Don't sweat it.

30:33.506 --> 30:35.573
I'm in a good place now.

30:35.575 --> 30:37.875
Yeah, what about the little kid
who went through all that?

30:37.877 --> 30:38.943
How does he feel?

30:38.945 --> 30:40.544
That's kid's dead, Charlie.

30:40.546 --> 30:43.147
Yeah? Then how come
I can still see him?

30:49.087 --> 30:52.523
What are you gonna do, Blake?

30:52.525 --> 30:53.791
Are you gonna torment the living

30:53.793 --> 30:55.259
till they feel as bad as you do?

30:55.261 --> 30:58.262
I don't know. Worth a try.

30:58.264 --> 30:59.830
I know what your parents did to you.

30:59.832 --> 31:01.032
Stop it.

31:01.034 --> 31:03.467
- Why are you protecting them?
- Just stop it.

31:05.537 --> 31:09.040
Charlie... Because I was bad.

31:09.042 --> 31:12.476
They tried to fix me, but they couldn't.

31:12.478 --> 31:15.112
You're not bad, buddy.

31:15.114 --> 31:17.381
There's no such thing.

31:17.383 --> 31:19.550
Then why did they do it?

31:25.624 --> 31:29.260
Because they were hurting,

31:29.262 --> 31:32.063
and they were in pain,

31:32.065 --> 31:35.466
and no one helped them.

31:35.468 --> 31:39.470
And I'm not gonna let
the same thing happen to you.

31:39.472 --> 31:43.741
It's time you stopped paying
for their mistakes, okay?

31:43.743 --> 31:48.379
I just don't want to hurt anymore.

31:48.381 --> 31:50.514
I know.

31:50.516 --> 31:52.883
You won't.

31:52.885 --> 31:54.251
Uh...

31:54.253 --> 31:56.454
But I need you to do something for me.

31:58.457 --> 32:00.958
Can you be brave?

32:00.960 --> 32:04.295
Am I dying?

32:04.297 --> 32:06.964
No.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.599
You're free.

32:19.912 --> 32:22.713
Bart: Somebody said
I roughed up a Dr. Scott?

32:22.715 --> 32:24.115
How is he?

32:24.117 --> 32:27.451
He's still a pain in the ass,
but that's not your fault.

32:27.453 --> 32:29.253
Bart, we figured out
what's wrong with you.

32:29.255 --> 32:31.522
You have R.E.M. sleep
behavior disorder.

32:31.524 --> 32:32.857
Do you know what that is?

32:32.859 --> 32:34.692
Is it like sleep terrors?

32:34.694 --> 32:36.393
My mom said I had that
when I was a kid.

32:36.395 --> 32:38.262
Sometimes it's confused
with sleep terrors,

32:38.264 --> 32:40.464
but the disorder
means that the paralysis

32:40.466 --> 32:43.634
that normally occurs
during R.E.M. sleep is absent.

32:43.636 --> 32:46.604
So the sufferer
"acts out" their dreams.

32:46.606 --> 32:49.406
It can be triggered by stress
or sleep deprivation.

32:49.408 --> 32:51.775
You been burning the candle
at both ends?

32:51.777 --> 32:53.844
I started picking up
some extra shifts

32:53.846 --> 32:55.479
after my last roommate bailed.

32:55.481 --> 32:58.015
I guess I haven't
got caught up on sleep.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.084
Well, good news is
you can relax now.

33:00.086 --> 33:02.119
We're gonna keep you overnight,
run a couple tests,

33:02.121 --> 33:05.990
just make sure this isn't
related to something bigger.

33:05.992 --> 33:09.693
Oh. Great. So the weird
sleepwalking disease

33:09.695 --> 33:13.597
might be the least of
my problems. That's perfect.

33:13.599 --> 33:15.366
Is there anyone we can call for you?

33:15.368 --> 33:17.701
Actually, I was thinking I'd stay,

33:17.703 --> 33:20.504
you know, see how he makes out.

33:20.506 --> 33:23.641
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:23.643 --> 33:26.911
Uh, you obviously haven't looked
for an apartment in this city.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.781
Well, the dueling roomies
have made up,

33:30.783 --> 33:33.417
and all is right with the world.

33:33.419 --> 33:35.152
Maggs, I'm an idiot.

33:35.154 --> 33:37.388
I agree, but go on.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.822
Look.

33:38.824 --> 33:41.292
You shouldn't move in
with Sydney if you're not ready.

33:41.294 --> 33:43.194
It's just that I was happy
to finally see you happy,

33:43.196 --> 33:45.329
and I didn't want to see you
screw that up.

33:45.331 --> 33:48.699
Can we just go back to the part
where we agree you're an idiot?

33:48.701 --> 33:51.302
You like this girl.
I see it in your face

33:51.304 --> 33:54.838
every time you're with her.
So what gives?

33:54.840 --> 33:56.340
Every time that Syd and I get close,

33:56.342 --> 34:00.044
something goes down, and she leaves.

34:00.046 --> 34:02.313
I just don't want that to happen again.

34:02.315 --> 34:04.181
So, you think that keeping her
at arm's length

34:04.183 --> 34:07.918
is the surefire way to stay together.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.353
You think I'm being ridiculous.

34:09.355 --> 34:12.856
No. No, no, not at all.

34:12.858 --> 34:14.458
I think you're in love.

34:18.862 --> 34:21.031
How are you feeling, Trudy?

34:21.033 --> 34:25.369
Oh, you know, totally freaked out.

34:25.371 --> 34:27.538
How long is it gonna be like this?

34:27.540 --> 34:29.039
Just a few more weeks.

34:29.041 --> 34:30.774
And what about the baby?

34:30.775 --> 34:32.643
How is this gonna affect my pregnancy?

34:32.645 --> 34:33.978
It won't.

34:33.980 --> 34:36.580
You and the baby will be very
closely monitored, I promise.

34:36.581 --> 34:38.983
Oh, the cards were stacked against us,

34:38.985 --> 34:41.351
and yet here we are.

34:41.353 --> 34:43.887
Quod intelligitur esse.

34:43.889 --> 34:46.590
That's Latin for,
"It is meant to be."

34:46.592 --> 34:49.092
Hmm. Bashert.

34:49.094 --> 34:52.463
Yiddish. Means the same thing.

34:52.465 --> 34:55.599
Latin, Yiddish... We'll take
all the help we can get.

34:57.203 --> 34:59.169
It's been a long day.

34:59.171 --> 35:01.338
- You just rest, okay?
- Okay.

35:01.340 --> 35:04.608
But first, thought you might
want to hear something.

35:28.900 --> 35:31.235
Dad?

35:31.237 --> 35:32.569
I'll give you a moment.

35:32.571 --> 35:34.204
Thank you.

35:34.206 --> 35:37.374
What happened?

35:37.376 --> 35:40.277
What are all these things?

35:40.279 --> 35:42.546
Where's Kieran and Isaac, Dad?

35:45.050 --> 35:47.318
They're with your mother, Ezzie.

35:52.223 --> 35:53.924
They're gone?

35:57.195 --> 35:58.862
N...

35:58.864 --> 36:00.998
No.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.168
I promise I will do better.

36:04.170 --> 36:08.205
No. No, Dad.

36:08.207 --> 36:11.342
I'm s...

36:11.344 --> 36:15.079
I'm sorry.

36:40.585 --> 36:43.420
Hey.

36:43.422 --> 36:46.190
No, I haven't been, uh, lurking
here all day like a creep.

36:46.192 --> 36:49.560
I-I just got here.

36:49.562 --> 36:52.796
I, uh, thought maybe you'd want
to look over my answers

36:52.798 --> 36:54.531
before I send it in.

36:57.602 --> 36:59.436
And you're still angry.

37:01.973 --> 37:03.774
Okay, I get that.

37:03.776 --> 37:05.676
Um...

37:05.678 --> 37:07.978
Strange tendencies, learning disability,

37:07.980 --> 37:10.714
special needs, social anxiety.

37:12.750 --> 37:15.219
And finally one day, it was Asperger's.

37:17.622 --> 37:19.423
That was my list.

37:19.425 --> 37:22.359
Uh, Shahir, this, um...

37:22.361 --> 37:24.128
This isn't about that.

37:27.465 --> 37:30.601
When I look at this piece of paper

37:30.603 --> 37:33.537
and a list like that,

37:33.539 --> 37:35.305
you know, if my parents
were given a choice,

37:35.307 --> 37:37.608
I wonder if they would've chosen me.

37:41.146 --> 37:45.649
I wouldn't have made
anyone's list, Jonathan.

37:49.187 --> 37:52.089
Well, then how come you're on mine?

37:52.091 --> 37:53.290
Hmm?

37:53.292 --> 37:55.959
- You don't have a list.
- I do, and you're on it.

37:57.730 --> 37:59.530
But you're right, you know?

37:59.532 --> 38:01.932
We start making labels and lists

38:01.934 --> 38:06.103
and, uh, must-haves, and...

38:06.105 --> 38:09.873
we'll miss out on someone truly special.

38:09.875 --> 38:11.675
Then why are we doing it,

38:11.677 --> 38:13.410
hmm?

38:13.412 --> 38:17.714
Because if we don't, then we're
gonna miss out altogether.

38:17.716 --> 38:22.286
You do want a child, right?

38:22.288 --> 38:23.820
A baby?

38:28.059 --> 38:30.160
And nothing with babies comes easy.

38:30.162 --> 38:32.963
That's right.

38:32.965 --> 38:34.965
- Okay.
- Let's do this, then.

38:42.540 --> 38:43.674
What do you say

38:43.676 --> 38:46.343
to dual pillow-top comfort
with memory foam,

38:46.345 --> 38:49.279
complete with box frame
and under-bed storage?

38:49.281 --> 38:51.982
And here I was expecting
some weird medical scan.

38:51.984 --> 38:55.319
Au contraire. Though, I did do
a scan of your apartment,

38:55.321 --> 38:58.155
and my professional opinion
is you need a bigger bed.

38:58.157 --> 38:59.990
- Hmm.
- We need one.

38:59.992 --> 39:02.993
- I need one.
- You trying to move in with me?

39:02.995 --> 39:06.463
I'm serious about us. Sue me.

39:06.465 --> 39:09.266
Wait till you see the, uh,
goose-down pillows I found.

39:11.536 --> 39:15.539
We put a skull in a pregnant
woman's abdominal wall today.

39:15.541 --> 39:16.607
Cool.

39:16.609 --> 39:18.375
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

39:18.377 --> 39:20.944
It was terrifying

39:20.946 --> 39:24.781
and... awe-inspiring.

39:27.185 --> 39:30.053
It's why I became a doctor.

39:30.055 --> 39:31.455
You know?

39:31.457 --> 39:36.159
That feeling, it's like...a drug.

39:36.161 --> 39:37.794
I knew from the moment I started

39:37.796 --> 39:40.163
that I wanted to work
at the very best hospitals,

39:40.165 --> 39:42.199
and I won't give that up.

39:42.201 --> 39:44.901
Not for anyone.

39:44.903 --> 39:47.638
Is someone asking you to?

39:47.640 --> 39:50.841
I got a job offer.

39:50.843 --> 39:54.011
At Torbin General.

39:54.013 --> 39:56.146
Torbin General in London?

39:58.983 --> 40:01.285
Oh, I knew it.

40:01.287 --> 40:03.887
You keep doing this to me.

40:03.889 --> 40:08.325
As soon as I let you in,
as soon as I commit to us...

40:08.327 --> 40:09.826
Come with me.

40:09.828 --> 40:10.894
What?

40:10.896 --> 40:13.397
There are geese 
in England.

40:13.399 --> 40:14.665
Sorry?

40:14.667 --> 40:16.733
For the pillows.

40:16.735 --> 40:18.835
I'm serious. Come with me.

40:18.837 --> 40:21.171
I can't go without you, Maggie.
I can't. I...

40:21.173 --> 40:24.241
I'll come.

40:25.611 --> 40:28.779
- You will?
- Yeah.

40:28.781 --> 40:30.147
Okay.

40:35.688 --> 40:38.689
Mm, but, seriously,
we need a bigger bed.

40:53.137 --> 40:54.237
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:54.239 --> 40:55.939
Sorry, I didn't realize
you were coming over.

40:55.941 --> 40:57.374
I already put Luke down.

40:57.376 --> 41:00.077
Oh, that's okay. I gave him
a few extra hugs this morning.

41:00.079 --> 41:01.712
Should tide me over.

41:01.714 --> 41:03.447
Brought you, uh, dim sum

41:03.449 --> 41:06.850
from that place you like
with the flowers on the tables.

41:10.154 --> 41:11.621
Bringing out the big guns?

41:11.623 --> 41:13.190
Ohh, yeah.

41:16.060 --> 41:18.929
Listen. Um...

41:18.931 --> 41:22.499
Blake was, uh...

41:22.501 --> 41:23.867
was this poor messed-up kid

41:23.869 --> 41:27.237
with, um, very cruel parents.

41:30.809 --> 41:35.212
And they broke his heart.

41:35.214 --> 41:37.948
He's gone now.

41:37.950 --> 41:40.951
This one really rattled you.

41:40.953 --> 41:44.554
Yeah, yeah. He, uh...

41:44.556 --> 41:46.857
He could touch things,
move them around.

41:46.859 --> 41:50.026
Don't know how he did that.

41:53.232 --> 41:55.899
Okay, Charlie, you know
the dream that I had earlier?

41:58.604 --> 42:02.239
Something... a spirit
or a ghost or whatever...

42:05.810 --> 42:07.944
It took one of our kids.

42:07.946 --> 42:10.480
I-I know it sounds crazy.

42:10.482 --> 42:12.315
But with everything that's going
on, I just...

42:12.317 --> 42:14.985
Alex, I took care of it, okay?
It's not gonna happen again.

42:14.987 --> 42:16.420
You-You can't say that.

42:16.422 --> 42:19.322
You-You don't know.
This thing is-is changing.

42:19.324 --> 42:20.791
What if something
really bad happens?

42:20.793 --> 42:22.959
Nothing bad is gonna happen, okay?

42:22.961 --> 42:25.896
I swear to you.

42:25.898 --> 42:27.931
I'll prove it to you if I have to.

42:31.036 --> 42:33.537
No matter what happens,

42:33.539 --> 42:36.139
okay?

42:36.141 --> 42:38.341
Okay.
