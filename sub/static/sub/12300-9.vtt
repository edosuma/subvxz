01:13.539 --> 01:16.918
There's been speculation that this
police investigation will start...

01:16.918 --> 01:20.421
with one of the victims
involved in an office dispute,

01:20.421 --> 01:22.173
but that has not yet
been confirmed.

01:22.173 --> 01:24.258
Thank you.
This much I can tell you ...

01:24.258 --> 01:27.303
Can you believe it? It's national news and
we don't even know what happened.

01:27.595 --> 01:31.015
Some alpaca herdsman in Peru knows
more about our case than we do.

01:31.015 --> 01:32.558
He knows what to
look for, he does.

01:36.229 --> 01:37.271
One over the left eye...

01:43.653 --> 01:45.196
... and one right between the eyes ...

01:53.538 --> 01:58.626
...and one into the right eye--
boom, boom, boom--

01:58.626 --> 02:00.294
and that's called the kill zone.

02:00.670 --> 02:02.588
No messing around,
clean and deadly.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.883
Hey, guys.
So, nobody saw a shooter.

02:05.883 --> 02:08.386
I've got seven people that
say they heard a shot.

02:08.636 --> 02:10.972
One shot for all three victims?

02:10.972 --> 02:12.515
Yeah, it's ridiculous--
one shot.

02:13.224 --> 02:14.267
There's no way.

02:14.267 --> 02:18.855
I also have a couple of witnesses.
They say they heard a car screech away.

02:19.397 --> 02:21.149
So we're still interviewing.
Keep me posted.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.986
So how did three people
get shot in broad daylight...

02:24.986 --> 02:27.280
on a busy street and
nobody sees anything?

02:28.740 --> 02:29.782
Sniper.

03:15.877 --> 03:19.505
No two witnesses place the shot
coming from the same direction.

03:20.131 --> 03:21.382
Okay, shoes ...

03:22.217 --> 03:24.886
Lost shoes indicate people
running for their lives.

03:24.886 --> 03:29.849
Yeah, not these three: Jason Groves,
Lou Blake, and Maya Franklin.

03:29.849 --> 03:34.854
Jason was a stockbroker, Lou a janitor,
and Maya was a secretary.

03:35.021 --> 03:35.772
They work together?

03:35.772 --> 03:39.275
No. So far, there hasn't been any
connection or workplace issues.

03:39.275 --> 03:40.944
You know, the press got it wrong.

03:40.944 --> 03:43.196
Let's get all the surveillance
video from the street --

03:43.196 --> 03:44.322
interior and exterior.

03:44.322 --> 03:45.114
You got it.

03:45.114 --> 03:47.700
Alexx, how many bullets
am I looking for?

03:48.034 --> 03:50.995
Guy in the suit --
bullet lodged in his head.

03:50.995 --> 03:56.209
That man, same thing. And let's see what
happened to your bullet, sweetheart.

03:56.876 --> 03:59.087
Messed up your pretty weave,
that's for sure.

04:00.255 --> 04:03.800
Yeah, it went right through you.
Through and through.

04:04.008 --> 04:06.010
Okay. Calleigh?

04:06.010 --> 04:08.012
Let's find the third bullet.
We need to triangulate.

04:08.012 --> 04:10.473
Hopefully, we can locate the
shooter's position.

04:10.473 --> 04:11.516
Speed.

04:16.103 --> 04:18.147
Don't these people have
anything better to do?

04:18.147 --> 04:21.024
Okay, all right, remember where you are.
Anything catch your eye?

04:21.024 --> 04:21.776
Not yet.

04:21.776 --> 04:23.695
All right. So, let's get
everything back to the lab.

04:23.695 --> 04:27.866
We need to start the victimology and figure
out why these three people got shot, okay?

04:28.616 --> 04:29.993
I've got one divot over here.

04:32.912 --> 04:37.250
Victim dropped in her tracks,
bullet went through her head ...

04:37.250 --> 04:39.669
hit here, based on
the teardrop shape.

04:41.671 --> 04:45.842
Tail indicates that it traveled
in this direction ...

04:48.303 --> 04:50.346
... and maybe it's a small caliber.

04:51.681 --> 04:52.432
Looks like a .223.

04:52.432 --> 04:56.811
.223. Okay, let's get the trajectory.

04:56.811 --> 05:00.982
You and I will work the bullets.
Alexx, you and I are on the bodies.

05:12.035 --> 05:15.914
Okay, Maya, let's see what's
going on with you.

05:20.335 --> 05:21.669
Angle is downward ...

05:23.338 --> 05:28.551
into the glabella, perforated the brain,
then exited through the occipital bone.

05:40.522 --> 05:42.607
20.5 degrees.

05:42.607 --> 05:44.317
What were the other angles?

05:46.694 --> 05:51.908
20.8 and downward; Mr. Groves.
20.1 downward; Mr. Blake.

05:52.033 --> 05:55.870
Hard to get that shot from the ground
unless the shooter's ten feet tall.

05:56.579 --> 05:58.414
Or they're in a tenth-story window.

06:00.708 --> 06:04.212
Bullet entered her brain, shut down her
central nervous system --

06:04.212 --> 06:05.255
immediately fatal.

06:10.969 --> 06:15.139
Never felt a thing. Next best thing
to going in your sleep.

06:19.435 --> 06:21.521
These are not your
daddy's bullets.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.858
Normally bullets have
striations, but these don't.

06:25.233 --> 06:26.943
Sabots encased in plastic.

06:27.360 --> 06:31.322
Specialty bullets: Not illegal but
also not widely available.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.830
Right -- encased in plastic
to protect the bullet,

06:38.830 --> 06:41.958
making it impossible to match
it to a specific weapon, right?

06:41.958 --> 06:44.627
This guy is thinking ahead.
He does not want to get caught.

06:44.627 --> 06:48.298
Maybe he's just beginning. Three dead
before morning rush hour is over.

06:49.340 --> 06:53.511
Who knows ... Excuse me. ...
What the day will bring us.

06:54.679 --> 06:55.513
Horatio.

06:55.513 --> 06:57.390
... And the rest is back here.

06:58.516 --> 07:00.852
Sitting right there was
Dee Lawrence --

07:01.686 --> 07:04.272
73, tourist from Oklahoma.

07:06.482 --> 07:09.319
She was shot at 9:15 when
the bus driver stopped...

07:09.319 --> 07:12.447
for a bathroom break
around second near Langley.

07:12.655 --> 07:15.366
Wait a minute. Did you just say
Second and Langley?

07:19.537 --> 07:20.955
We've got a fourth victim.

07:22.498 --> 07:25.001
The driver said he saw people
running outside.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.837
He heard the back
window shatter.

07:29.130 --> 07:32.217
he heard screams,
he didn't know what was going on,

07:32.217 --> 07:34.260
and in a panic, took off.

07:34.160 --> 07:37.038
He went straight to the hospital.
They couldn't save her.

07:37.038 --> 07:40.125
Why would he suddenly be shooting
at a moving target, though?

07:40.750 --> 07:41.668
He missed?

07:42.710 --> 07:45.088
Not this guy.
Not this guy.

08:45.148 --> 08:47.734
Victim number four,
the grandmother.

08:47.734 --> 08:50.278
Trajectory is upward ...

08:50.278 --> 08:52.781
into the left ...
temporal lobe.

08:54.741 --> 08:58.661
Alexx, you just said upward --
2.5 degrees upward.

08:58.661 --> 08:59.579
How is that possible?

08:59.579 --> 09:00.705
Ricochet?

09:03.333 --> 09:05.960
You're going to tell me that
that bullet is not a sabot.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.420
No, it's a nine millimeter.

09:07.420 --> 09:10.590
And that means we have two shooters:
One in the sky, one on the ground.

09:10.590 --> 09:13.009
Then that could explain the shot
that was heard at the scene.

09:13.009 --> 09:14.385
Could be from the nine millimeter.
Megan,

09:14.636 --> 09:17.555
Megan, you and Eric are on a different case.
Take the grandmother on the bus.

09:17.889 --> 09:18.932
You got it.

09:19.557 --> 09:20.934
We have somewhere to be.

09:27.023 --> 09:28.066
That's good.

09:29.359 --> 09:30.068
All right, good.

09:30.276 --> 09:34.447
These lasers should get us up close to
where these shots were taken from.

09:35.406 --> 09:36.449
You ready, Angel?

09:37.826 --> 09:39.911
All right...
let 'er rip.

09:51.423 --> 09:53.049
650 yards.

09:56.177 --> 09:57.887
That's six and a half
football fields.

09:57.887 --> 09:59.472
One shot, one kill.

10:02.392 --> 10:05.103
This guy's either military
traded or police.

10:05.145 --> 10:08.022
He's marine corps, probably.
They're the best snipers in the world.

10:08.648 --> 10:12.819
So, that is his nest up there.
Let's go find out if he left us anything.

10:25.230 --> 10:29.401
The sniper taped that door shut. He didn't
want the gunshots echoing in the stairwell.

10:29.401 --> 10:33.196
He would have had to disassemble the rifle
and hide it in something to get it up here.

10:33.196 --> 10:36.867
Maybe it was a Winchester model 70 or
a Remington 700, I don't know.

10:36.867 --> 10:39.536
Charles Whitman disguised himself
as a delivery man to get up ...

10:39.536 --> 10:42.497
the Texas tower and he got there,
he just wheeled his guns...

10:42.497 --> 10:46.668
and his ammo onto the observation deck and
killed fourteen people. He wounded 31.

10:46.793 --> 10:50.005
This sniper moved to the
high ground as well, didn't he?

10:50.005 --> 10:54.551
All right, if I was a sniper,
what's the first thing I would do?

10:54.759 --> 10:58.054
You'd pick your spot.
Prone position is best for shooting.

10:58.054 --> 11:02.058
Right, the problem is, is this
wall obscures my view of the target.

11:02.601 --> 11:04.644
Yeah, so maybe you
were kneeling.

11:06.104 --> 11:09.024
And maybe I went higher.
Take a look at that.

11:14.196 --> 11:18.158
So what do you get
when a six-foot-tall man...

11:18.158 --> 11:20.577
lays down with a
three-foot-long rifle?

11:21.203 --> 11:23.580
Hot flashes.
But that's just me.

11:25.665 --> 11:28.251
What you get is a GSR cone.

11:33.673 --> 11:35.675
This is his location.

11:35.675 --> 11:37.636
This is where he shot from.

11:37.636 --> 11:40.472
This is a tough
location for exposure.

11:40.472 --> 11:43.600
You can be seen by a helicopter,
any one of these buildings ...

11:46.853 --> 11:49.564
I've got burlap with gravel glued on.

11:50.732 --> 11:51.775
Camouflage.

11:52.067 --> 11:54.528
Better than camouflage --
you know what that is?

11:54.528 --> 11:58.198
That's from a homemade
urban guilley suit.

11:59.241 --> 12:01.618
It's what marines wear in the
desert as camouflage.

12:04.663 --> 12:06.790
And take a look at this.

12:07.833 --> 12:10.418
This is not gunpowder.

12:12.504 --> 12:13.588
Sand.

12:13.588 --> 12:14.923
Sand.
On a roof?

12:16.466 --> 12:18.593
Yeah, it's from a sand sock.

12:18.593 --> 12:22.931
You hold it in your hand or you put it on
the ground, right underneath the muzzle,

12:22.931 --> 12:27.102
and one squeeze is enough to raise the
barrel right to the sweet spot on the target.

12:33.150 --> 12:34.526
This guy is scary.

12:41.783 --> 12:45.078
Look, Marisol,
it's not my case, okay?

12:45.078 --> 12:50.250
If you want dad to stay home or call in sick
from work you should call him yourself.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.376
You know he's not
going to listen, okay?

12:51.376 --> 12:55.964
I got to go. I have to go.
I'll call you later. Bye.

12:58.466 --> 13:00.051
What's up?
You talking to your sister?

13:00.051 --> 13:03.597
Yeah, our dad works downtown
and she worries about everything.

13:04.848 --> 13:07.350
So what's going on
with the sniper case?

13:07.642 --> 13:12.856
Well, Horatio and Calleigh found
his nest and I'm on victimology.

13:12.898 --> 13:14.191
Find any connection?

13:14.191 --> 13:15.484
Nothing obvious.

13:15.775 --> 13:18.445
That's good time to look
for the un-obvious.

13:19.696 --> 13:22.949
I'm aware of that. H.
Says that to me all the time.

13:23.158 --> 13:25.327
You know, it's great minds ...

13:25.327 --> 13:26.411
You're unbelievable.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.414
I am.
See you later.

13:32.501 --> 13:35.170
Hey, they get anything on the
nine millimeter in Grandma Lawrence?

13:35.170 --> 13:36.546
Show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

13:36.546 --> 13:38.131
Nothing. No match in IBIS.

13:38.131 --> 13:41.510
Ah, I've got something.
Nine millimeter plus. Check it out.

13:42.552 --> 13:46.139
That spec is government issue
blue paint called "postal blue."

13:46.139 --> 13:47.807
One guess what it's used on?

13:47.807 --> 13:49.184
Depressed mailmen.

13:50.727 --> 13:55.315
The bullet that killed grandma ricocheted off
a mailbox near northeast second and Langley.

13:56.316 --> 13:59.152
Must be this one near the
southeast corner.

14:00.195 --> 14:03.615
Put one of those uh,
chartered tour buses in the street.

14:06.409 --> 14:08.995
And line up the back of the
bus with the mailbox.

14:12.123 --> 14:14.209
Can you do a 180 to
the other side?

14:19.214 --> 14:20.298
An ATM.

14:21.466 --> 14:23.009
What do ATMs have?

14:23.009 --> 14:24.636
Surveillance cameras.

14:25.053 --> 14:29.224
And what do I have?
Surveillance tapes from downtown.

14:33.353 --> 14:36.773
Adhesive residue on the rooftop
door was electrical tape.

14:37.607 --> 14:40.318
And we got through the night
without another shooting.

14:40.318 --> 14:42.487
My mom wants me to
come home to Louisiana,

14:42.487 --> 14:44.990
but I told her even Al Qaeda
couldn't make me.

14:45.323 --> 14:48.285
People are starting to get nervous,
which is the way he wants it.

14:48.285 --> 14:50.078
Take a look at this and
tell me what you think it is.

14:52.164 --> 14:53.665
Some type of vegetation.

14:54.207 --> 14:55.876
We found three of
them on the roof.

14:56.877 --> 15:01.381
In terms of the guilley suit, we were right.
Made the entire thing out of this --

15:01.381 --> 15:04.509
the burlap we found up there.
Must've taken him weeks.

15:04.634 --> 15:08.597
Snipers are patient. They can lay in
wait for days waiting for the target.

15:08.597 --> 15:10.182
If conditions aren't right,
they won't take the shot.

15:10.182 --> 15:11.600
You know a lot about snipers.

15:11.600 --> 15:15.187
I used to date one.
Marine corps, special op, 38 kills.

15:15.187 --> 15:17.772
He's retired now. He runs a
rifle range about an hour away.

15:17.814 --> 15:20.317
You still friends?
Yeah.

15:34.956 --> 15:37.334
Been a while since
I fired one of these.

15:37.334 --> 15:38.585
You know your way around a gun.

15:40.962 --> 15:42.005
Sniping is different.

15:43.882 --> 15:45.675
Comes to shooting,
you can't trust just your eyes.

15:45.675 --> 15:47.052
Just like a crime scene.

15:47.344 --> 15:49.429
Most people think a bullet
travels in a straight line.

15:50.305 --> 15:52.516
The  actual path of a bullet
is arced, like a rainbow.

15:58.605 --> 16:00.732
That's the first thing your
sniper has to take into account.

16:00.732 --> 16:05.946
The next thing is the wind.
See that tall grass, fifty feet ahead?

16:06.404 --> 16:09.533
Means the wind is moving at
three to five miles an hour.

16:09.533 --> 16:12.661
But at 75 feet, wind speed's
completely different.

16:13.328 --> 16:14.371
Take a look at those tall reeds.

16:15.455 --> 16:17.666
Tells you the wind is going
at five to eight miles an hour.

16:20.210 --> 16:23.380
So no matter where your target is,
you adjust for the wind.

16:23.380 --> 16:24.714
Kentucky windage.

16:24.714 --> 16:28.385
In the 20/100th of a second it
takes a sniper to pull the trigger...

16:28.385 --> 16:31.346
he takes one controlled breath ...

16:32.097 --> 16:34.266
and decides if conditions
are right to take a life.

16:38.520 --> 16:41.231
You put a human being at the
end of the barrel of your weapon ...

16:41.231 --> 16:42.774
and you become god.

16:43.441 --> 16:44.651
You have all the power.

16:48.405 --> 16:49.447
You stay in control.

16:51.158 --> 16:52.742
The shot has to be perfect to take it.

16:59.374 --> 17:02.586
We know you were downtown
yesterday morning at this ATM.

17:02.586 --> 17:06.673
You took out $40.00 at around 9:15,
right before that sniper hit.

17:06.673 --> 17:10.218
Yeah, I ... I hit the ground.
It scared me to death.

17:10.218 --> 17:12.596
Really.
What'd you see?

17:12.721 --> 17:14.097
Pavement,
like everybody else.

17:14.097 --> 17:15.932
I was talking about who was
doing the shooting.

17:15.932 --> 17:20.270
I didn't see anybody.
Just the other people who were dying.

17:20.479 --> 17:22.355
Mr. Santoya, do you own a gun?

17:22.355 --> 17:25.275
A gun?
No. Never.

17:27.109 --> 17:28.945
What's this all about?

17:28.945 --> 17:30.655
May we come in?
Why?

17:30.655 --> 17:32.115
We just want to talk to you.

17:32.115 --> 17:33.867
So go ahead and talk.

17:34.701 --> 17:37.704
All right, there was another
shooting downtown yesterday.

17:37.704 --> 17:39.456
Someone killed a
73-year-old grandmother.

17:39.456 --> 17:43.001
And that someone was near the
ATM the same time as you.

17:45.170 --> 17:47.130
Look, I-I ...
I wish could help you.

17:48.465 --> 17:49.508
I'm sorry.

17:49.925 --> 17:52.219
If you'll excuse me,
I have other things to do.

17:53.053 --> 17:54.095
I'm sorry.

17:57.474 --> 17:58.433
You believe that?

17:58.433 --> 18:01.061
What? That he slammed the
door in our faces or his story?

18:01.061 --> 18:03.355
Either. Neither.
He's hiding something.

18:03.980 --> 18:06.191
You're looking at
Japanese Black Pine.

18:06.191 --> 18:10.153
Now, it's not indigenous to Miami but
it is commonly used to grow bonsai trees.

18:10.362 --> 18:12.030
Our sniper has a hobby.

18:12.030 --> 18:16.368
And patience - it takes twenty to thirty
years to grow a bonsai tree.

18:16.368 --> 18:17.911
I also found urine.

18:17.994 --> 18:20.622
Probably up there all night
waiting to take his shots.

18:22.290 --> 18:23.291
It happened again.

18:24.334 --> 18:29.256
Police just arrived on the scene. Now,
witnesses tell us one person has been shot.

18:29.256 --> 18:31.341
There may be others,
we just don't know yet.

18:31.341 --> 18:35.512
What we do know is that the sniper has
once again struck in downtown Miami.

18:35.679 --> 18:38.640
Second day, second shooting.

18:39.182 --> 18:41.184
Could be unrelated.
Could be a copycat.

18:41.184 --> 18:42.602
It's the same part of town.

18:42.602 --> 18:46.231
Yeah, but the first shooting happened
in the morning. The MO's different.

18:46.231 --> 18:49.025
Is it? The only time busier
than early morning...

18:49.025 --> 18:51.236
is evening rush hour when
people are trying to get home.

18:51.653 --> 18:53.280
Or get a quick bite to eat.

18:55.365 --> 18:59.578
Michael Corday, 39. Professor
at Miami-Dade Community College,

18:59.578 --> 19:02.205
had a wife and three kids
and no one heard any shots.

19:02.372 --> 19:04.249
He just bought a hot dog
and fell over dead.

19:05.083 --> 19:08.545
Director's ready to have a stroke.
He wants to call in the feds.

19:08.670 --> 19:12.257
Two shootings, two days, four victims
-- this guy's on a spree.

19:12.257 --> 19:13.758
Can we place him on a building?

19:13.758 --> 19:16.595
Not with just one bullet,
but I can approximate distance.

19:16.595 --> 19:19.598
So the only evidence we have
are bullets we can't use...

19:19.598 --> 19:21.057
and strips of a
homemade guilley suit.

19:21.057 --> 19:24.227
Let's not forget the sand
and the bonsai needles.

19:25.270 --> 19:28.356
The further the evidence takes us
away from the crime scene,

19:28.356 --> 19:30.650
the greater the chance he'll let
down his guard.

19:31.359 --> 19:32.944
And that's when we'll get him.

19:38.866 --> 19:39.908
Speed.

19:40.617 --> 19:43.912
So, betonanything.com posted
three-to-one odds ...

19:43.912 --> 19:45.330
that he's going to shoot
again monday morning.

19:45.330 --> 19:46.498
Sounds like a good bet.

19:46.498 --> 19:48.834
Ten-to-one odds that he's going
to shoot in a different location.

19:48.834 --> 19:51.754
Okay, but he is shooting people
downtown for a reason.

19:52.171 --> 19:54.882
Well, you know,
Delko's dad works downtown ...

19:54.882 --> 19:57.301
and his sister doesn't
want him to go to work.

19:59.011 --> 20:01.305
What do you think the odds are,
realistically,

20:01.305 --> 20:04.016
that we're going to find this guy
before somebody else gets killed?

20:04.391 --> 20:08.604
I don't know. But if this guy gets us to
change the way we do our jobs,

20:08.604 --> 20:12.441
then those odds are going to go up.
So let's not do that, okay?

20:12.608 --> 20:13.901
All right.

20:13.901 --> 20:14.943
Hang in there.

20:19.281 --> 20:20.324
He's lying.

20:21.533 --> 20:23.619
About what,
I don't know.

20:25.245 --> 20:26.497
So what do we know?

20:27.956 --> 20:31.710
That, at 9:15, Ray Santoya
was at the ATM.

20:31.919 --> 20:34.838
And so, the question is:
What was he doing at 9:16?

20:35.339 --> 20:39.802
Shooting the nine-millimeter at something.
Maybe he saw the sniper.

20:40.010 --> 20:41.595
Or was working with him.

20:42.221 --> 20:44.640
Wait.
Go back one.

20:45.057 --> 20:46.100
What do you see?

20:53.399 --> 20:55.359
Bring his face up full screen.

20:57.236 --> 20:58.487
His glasses.

20:58.487 --> 20:59.613
There's a reflection.

21:10.374 --> 21:13.043
It's the Nuevitas baseball team.
That's their logo.

21:13.252 --> 21:15.587
And he's talking to whoever's
wearing that jacket.

21:16.213 --> 21:17.631
We may have a witness.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.091
To both shootings.

21:26.432 --> 21:27.516
Can I help you?

21:29.184 --> 21:31.937
Yeah. Uh, we're looking
for Ray Santoya.

21:32.896 --> 21:33.939
He's not here.

21:34.690 --> 21:37.943
Miami Dade Police.
Can we come in?

21:38.777 --> 21:40.904
Sure.
Yes.

21:41.530 --> 21:42.614
Thank you.

21:45.951 --> 21:46.994
And you are?

21:47.828 --> 21:49.163
Gustavo Santoya.

21:49.371 --> 21:50.622
Gustavo?

21:52.708 --> 21:53.667
What's going on?

21:53.876 --> 21:56.003
We need to ask you and your
son some questions.

21:56.003 --> 21:56.920
What about?

21:58.797 --> 22:00.340
Do you mind if I take
a look at that jacket?

22:00.340 --> 22:02.092
Wait a minute, what for?

22:03.135 --> 22:04.261
Right here.

22:06.346 --> 22:07.431
What the hell are you doing?

22:07.639 --> 22:08.891
Don't worry.
It's waterproof.

22:15.606 --> 22:17.191
But not GSR-proof.

22:19.068 --> 22:20.402
Remove your jacket, please.

22:20.402 --> 22:22.446
No, no, it-it's not his.
It's mine.

22:22.446 --> 22:23.614
Father ...
I was wearing it.

22:23.614 --> 22:24.364
Don't do this.

22:24.364 --> 22:29.495
It was me. I was there.
Nobody else. And not my son.

22:35.209 --> 22:37.711
I swear on my mother's grave,
no lo sabia.

22:38.295 --> 22:40.214
I didn't know.
People were ...

22:42.007 --> 22:44.134
Yo crei que veia al
que disparava.

22:44.676 --> 22:46.220
You thought you saw the sniper?

22:46.637 --> 22:47.971
No, not the sniper.

22:48.180 --> 22:49.223
Then who?

22:55.771 --> 22:58.899
The car was full of callejeros ...
street kids.

23:01.485 --> 23:03.570
I thought I saw a gun.

23:03.570 --> 23:07.741
El tenia una pistola negra. A black gun--
he was holding it. I swear to you.

23:09.827 --> 23:11.912
I didn't see any woman in the car.

23:12.996 --> 23:14.039
Solo los cuatro muchachos.

23:15.624 --> 23:16.959
The four boys were laughing ...

23:19.503 --> 23:20.879
at the people dying.

23:22.047 --> 23:24.758
Well, you didn't see her because
she wasn't in the car.

23:32.516 --> 23:33.892
Tell her family I'm sorry.

23:35.269 --> 23:37.646
I was trying to protect my father.

23:42.484 --> 23:43.527
All right.

23:46.989 --> 23:48.031
Okay, get up.

24:00.586 --> 24:02.212
Four dead in the so-called
Miami sniper ...

24:02.212 --> 24:04.506
... four shootings, so far,
have been linked to the sniper.

24:04.506 --> 24:07.926
A car backfired earlier today,
causing panic in downtown Miami ...

24:07.926 --> 24:10.262
... worried parents are keeping their
children home from school...

24:10.262 --> 24:13.724
... the special bullet is designed to prevent
the authorities from tracking...

24:13.724 --> 24:15.017
...some people say they can't trust...

24:15.017 --> 24:17.644
So far, all victims have been
shot during rush hour.

26:31.987 --> 26:34.239
So far, I've confirmed
our businessman...

26:34.239 --> 26:37.910
was inside the dry cleaners two
minutes before all hell broke loose.

26:37.910 --> 26:40.662
Good. Good.
Confirm this for me.

26:40.996 --> 26:42.623
The sand on the right is...?

26:44.500 --> 26:48.378
Is ... a mixture of
calcifying green algae

26:48.629 --> 26:53.092
and brown swiss cheese-looking
grains uniform in size.

26:53.092 --> 26:54.468
Likely from erosion?

26:54.468 --> 26:55.219
Beach sand.

26:55.219 --> 26:59.473
Sand on the left? Found traces of this
on the roof, in the sniper's nest.

26:59.890 --> 27:02.309
Gastropods-snails --

27:03.352 --> 27:08.273
and football-shaped grains
of benthic foraminifier.

27:08.273 --> 27:12.069
But not homologous.
I'm thinking from a quarry.

27:12.486 --> 27:13.904
I'm thinking you're right.

27:16.281 --> 27:17.991
Based on the penetration test --

27:17.991 --> 27:20.452
I used a gelatin block to reconstruct
the human tissue --

27:20.452 --> 27:23.038
the shooter was 975 yards away.

27:23.038 --> 27:24.039
You're kidding.

27:24.039 --> 27:25.416
Give or take a yard or two.

27:25.416 --> 27:29.378
650 yards for the first shot,
975 for the second.

27:29.378 --> 27:30.587
He was showing off.

27:30.587 --> 27:32.798
Maybe he's making a sport of it.

27:33.841 --> 27:37.052
The sand in the shooter's
sand sock is coral.

27:37.261 --> 27:39.805
So he practices shooting
in a coral quarry.

27:39.805 --> 27:41.724
Right. Which would give
him the distance he needs.

27:41.724 --> 27:44.977
Now, these three locations
are all abandoned.

27:46.770 --> 27:50.733
Gives him the isolation he wants.
So you want to look at all three?

27:50.733 --> 27:52.901
Don't need to.
Take a look at that.

27:53.944 --> 27:54.945
Jet fuel.

27:54.945 --> 27:58.073
Jet fuel and coral.
Now watch this.

28:05.748 --> 28:08.375
There you go like
giving us directions.

28:39.990 --> 28:40.991
Natural sound cover.

28:41.408 --> 28:43.410
The perfect place
to keep your rifle on.

28:44.328 --> 28:45.370
So if I was him ...

28:48.791 --> 28:49.917
where would I shoot from?

28:52.753 --> 28:53.796
Well, he needs distance.

28:53.796 --> 28:56.381
Because he's a long-range shooter, right?

29:04.556 --> 29:05.933
Nothing moves here.

29:10.771 --> 29:11.772
Take a look at this.

29:15.651 --> 29:17.736
That flag is how he judges the wind.

29:18.737 --> 29:20.406
So if he's shooting from there ...

29:22.157 --> 29:23.534
Where does the bullet end up?

30:29.583 --> 30:34.380
Christopher Harwood, 42,
ex-marine corps special ops.

30:55.901 --> 30:57.361
His world and welcome to it.

31:04.034 --> 31:05.369
Everything's in perfect order.

31:05.703 --> 31:09.540
He's trying to control his environment
the way he wants to control us.

31:16.130 --> 31:17.673
Firearm data cards.

31:18.507 --> 31:20.592
There must be 20,000.

31:23.262 --> 31:25.556
He's recorded every
shot he's ever taken.

31:25.556 --> 31:26.598
Or planning to.

31:27.641 --> 31:29.310
This one was dated this morning.

31:34.898 --> 31:36.066
That could be residue.

31:36.817 --> 31:40.321
He's been on another rooftop
since taking out his latest victim.

31:40.321 --> 31:41.572
This could tell us where he's been.

31:41.572 --> 31:43.657
Or where he is right now.

31:48.329 --> 31:53.042
I matched the dry cleaning receipt to our
Stockbroker Jason Groves, screen on the left.

31:54.084 --> 31:57.630
He stops in to drop off his wife's
blouse and two pairs of pants.

31:57.630 --> 31:58.380
Okay.

31:58.380 --> 32:03.594
Screen on the right is Lou Blake, janitor.
He's picking up some pictures of his dogs.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.805
I hope somebody's feeding them.

32:08.057 --> 32:13.312
In the center, Maya Franklin, secretary.
She stops at Dade sugar and spice, 9:09.

32:14.605 --> 32:19.818
Stands in line five minutes and 23 seconds.
Three total strangers just living their lives.

32:19.985 --> 32:21.487
What about our fourth victim?

32:21.487 --> 32:24.740
On the cell phone, eating a hot dog,
talking to his wife.

32:24.740 --> 32:29.954
Okay ... one-hour photo shop one-hour
dry cleaners, coffee shop, fast food.

32:30.913 --> 32:32.373
Is that our theme?

32:33.874 --> 32:35.334
They were all in a hurry.

32:35.960 --> 32:36.835
Is that it?

32:36.835 --> 32:38.462
That was it for them.

32:40.547 --> 32:42.341
Five hours to rush hour.

33:02.194 --> 33:05.030
Let's find out what this
residue is made of.

33:17.876 --> 33:21.505
Three hours till downtown
becomes one big living target.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.044
Keep me posted.

33:29.549 --> 33:32.844
The substance on the back of the
data card was a hardcore adhesive...

33:32.844 --> 33:36.097
called rt600. It was only used two
years after Hurricane Andrew.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.100
To prevent rooftops from going airborne
in case of another hurricane.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.685
Now, I've narrowed it down
to three buildings.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.229
We've got to get it down to one.
Okay ...

33:43.229 --> 33:44.230
here's what we need to do.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.651
We've got to outhunt the hunter.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.527
Where do we start?

33:51.613 --> 33:52.656
Where he did.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.492
He climbed up to the roof of the hotel ...

33:57.994 --> 33:59.871
he'd been preparing
for a long time.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.667
He changed into his guilley suit...

34:05.627 --> 34:07.212
assembled his weapon ...

34:11.632 --> 34:13.301
... scope last.

34:21.518 --> 34:22.268
Climbs even higher ...

34:25.480 --> 34:26.940
gets into position ...

34:28.315 --> 34:30.318
He waited for the right conditions.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.947
Then his targets were irrelevant
because the people that he killed...

34:35.447 --> 34:39.202
were picked at random.
Meaning he picked spots ...

34:40.411 --> 34:41.538
and not victims.

34:47.460 --> 34:48.712
Once he hunkered down ...

34:58.555 --> 35:01.308
... he was up there all night,
dry firing.

35:03.393 --> 35:06.313
... he didn't eat,
he didn't move --

35:06.313 --> 35:07.355
not for any reason.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.070
He waited for as long as it took.

35:14.904 --> 35:18.074
And he didn't take the shot
until conditions were perfect.

35:18.825 --> 35:22.579
Like a skier visualizing a
hill before the race starts.

35:22.787 --> 35:27.709
Because he was waiting for
his puzzle to be complete.

35:31.755 --> 35:34.841
He used a flag or a tree
to gauge the wind.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.260
But it didn't matter how
long he waited ...

35:39.137 --> 35:44.351
... because as soon as those
pieces fell together he'd be ready.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.895
To take three shots.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.615
And the answer, my friend ...

36:42.701 --> 36:44.369
is blowin' in the wind.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.170
Speed ... what do you got?

36:54.796 --> 36:59.217
Of the three buildings that used rt600
after Hurricane Andrew only one

36:59.217 --> 37:02.387
has not been re-roofed
narrowing it down to this one.

37:02.679 --> 37:07.183
Now, these are satellite photos
taken from the past 72 hours.

37:07.183 --> 37:07.934
He hasn't been there.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.894
Okay, but this guy is a chameleon.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.272
He could blend into a side of beef.
Why this building?

37:12.606 --> 37:16.359
These are lines of sight from
the building to surrounding areas.

37:19.654 --> 37:21.740
Let's turn it 180 degrees, please.

37:26.369 --> 37:30.206
All industrial. Okay,
now shift 90 degrees west.

37:34.377 --> 37:35.712
Targets everywhere.

37:37.589 --> 37:41.760
Okay, now, there's a high-traffic area in the
upper left quadrant. Highlight that, please.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.933
Now let's check the line of sight.

37:50.435 --> 37:53.647
That's his kind of spot.
Lots of people walking into it.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.150
Yeah, but that's got to be
over 800 yards away.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.029
Get Eric up in the
chopper, Speed.

38:17.337 --> 38:20.423
Okay, H, I'm in position to
scramble the wind condition.

38:20.423 --> 38:23.134
Copy that, Eric.
Stay in position.

38:33.603 --> 38:36.731
Calleigh.
Calleigh, where are you?

38:37.565 --> 38:39.776
I'm with SWAT,
heading upstairs.

38:41.861 --> 38:44.447
Okay, you'll be my eyes and ears.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.368
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's a sniper in the vicinity.

38:48.368 --> 38:50.662
I need everyone
to leave the area now!

38:50.662 --> 38:54.499
Officer, listen, I need a 360
quarter-mile perimeter clear!

38:54.499 --> 38:55.292
You got it.

38:55.292 --> 38:56.543
Eric, speak to me.

38:57.377 --> 38:59.462
Ma'am-- can't be here.

39:05.719 --> 39:08.138
Horatio, you're right
in the line of fire.

39:08.346 --> 39:13.560
Okay, listen up! This guy is one shot, one kill.
If he can't make it, he's not going to take it.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.688
Eric, the wind from the
chopper ruins his shot.

39:20.275 --> 39:21.109
SWAT has him in sight.

39:22.235 --> 39:26.114
I need to know if this is all-clear.
I need confirmation, Calleigh.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.294
Release your weapon!

39:39.502 --> 39:40.545
Turn it over!

39:43.882 --> 39:46.968
Code four, code four.
Sniper has been apprehended.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.888
The sniper has been apprehended.
We have him in custody.

40:17.332 --> 40:20.377
Nice work. Have you considered
a transfer to SWAT?

40:21.002 --> 40:22.712
I don't look good in all black.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.256
I beg to differ.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.473
Don't you want to know why?

40:34.724 --> 40:37.310
You just killed four innocent people.
You're evil.

40:37.310 --> 40:40.647
You enjoy death.
I hope you enjoy your own. Take him.
