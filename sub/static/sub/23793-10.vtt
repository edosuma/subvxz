>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.100 --> 00:35.800
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:35.867 --> 00:36.533
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.600 --> 00:37.900
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:37.967 --> 00:39.000
FOR JOINING US.

00:39.066 --> 00:40.266
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:40.333 --> 00:41.300
THE WEEK,

00:41.367 --> 00:43.633
WHICH HAS ONCE AGAIN BEEN

00:43.700 --> 00:45.800
CHAOTIC, FROM A VOLCANO ERUPTING

00:45.867 --> 00:47.367
IN HAWAII TO KANYE WEST IMPLYING

00:47.433 --> 00:48.934
SLAVERY WAS A CHOICE

00:49.000 --> 00:50.667
TO PAUL RYAN PICKING A FIGHT

00:50.734 --> 00:51.400
WITH THE HOUSE CHAPLAIN

00:51.467 --> 00:52.567
FOR SOME REASON

00:52.633 --> 00:54.266
TO TRUMP SPEAKING AT THE NRA

00:54.333 --> 00:59.533
CONVENTION ABOUT KNIFE CRIME IN

00:59.600 --> 01:01.367
LONDON IN EXTREMELY VIVID TERMS.

01:01.433 --> 01:04.767
>> THERE'S BLOOD ALL OVER THE

01:04.834 --> 01:05.967
FLOORS OF THIS HOSPITAL.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.567
THEY SAY IT'S AS BAD AS A

01:07.633 --> 01:08.667
MILITARY WAR ZONE HOSPITAL.

01:08.734 --> 01:14.500
KNIVES, KNIVES KNIVES.

01:14.567 --> 01:15.400
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:15.467 --> 01:16.133
I'LL SAY THIS.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.367
HE MAY NOT BE PRESIDENTIAL

01:18.433 --> 01:19.200
MATERIAL, BUT SLAP

01:19.266 --> 01:20.467
A BLACK MOCK TURTLENECK ON HIM

01:20.533 --> 01:23.033
AND HIS SLAM POETRY IS ON POINT.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.767
"KNIVES, KNIVES, KNIVES.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.967
FORK, FORKS, FORKS.

01:27.033 --> 01:29.800
SPOONS."

01:29.867 --> 01:30.700
BUT LET'S NOT GET SUCKED INTO

01:30.767 --> 01:31.633
ALL THAT.

01:31.700 --> 01:32.166
INSTEAD, LET'S MOVE ON TO

01:32.233 --> 01:32.934
WEST VIRGINIA,

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
THE STATE WHOSE

01:34.066 --> 01:35.367
SEAL SEEMS TO COMMEMORATE PAPA

01:35.433 --> 01:39.734
SMURF'S DEATH IN THE CIVIL WAR.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.734
LOOK AT IT.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.533
IT'S A LITTLE RED SMURF HAT

01:41.600 --> 01:42.100
ON A GRAVE THAT SAYS

01:42.166 --> 01:42.734
"JUNE 20, 1863."

01:42.800 --> 01:44.233
WHAT ELSE COULD THAT POSSIBLY

01:44.300 --> 01:45.400
MEAN?

01:45.467 --> 01:46.800
ONE OF WEST VIRGINIA'S SENATE

01:46.867 --> 01:47.700
SEATS IS UP FOR GRABS THIS FALL,

01:47.767 --> 01:48.300
AND THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IS

01:48.367 --> 01:50.400
THIS TUESDAY.

01:50.467 --> 01:52.166
THE POLLS ARE CLOSE, WITH 24% OF

01:52.233 --> 01:53.500
VOTERS UNDECIDED, SO THIS RESULT

01:53.567 --> 01:54.867
IS VERY MUCH UP IN THE AIR.

01:54.934 --> 01:56.667
AND ONE CANDIDATE IN PARTICULAR

01:56.734 --> 01:58.667
HAS BEEN GRABBING HEADLINES.

01:58.734 --> 01:59.867
>> THE NEWEST CANDIDATE IN THIS

01:59.934 --> 02:00.900
RACE IS JUST HOPING THAT

02:00.967 --> 02:03.934
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS ARE

02:04.000 --> 02:05.100
REDEMPTION-MINDED BECAUSE HE

02:05.166 --> 02:07.533
JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON.

02:07.600 --> 02:08.767
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT.

02:08.834 --> 02:09.834
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I PRESENT

02:09.900 --> 02:12.166
TO YOU YOUR NEWEST WEST VIRGINIA

02:12.233 --> 02:15.767
SENATE CANDIDATE, O.J. SIMPSON!

02:15.834 --> 02:16.233
I'M KIDDING!

02:16.300 --> 02:16.734
I'M KIDDING!

02:16.800 --> 02:17.400
I'M KIDDING!

02:17.467 --> 02:23.433
I'M KIDDING!

02:23.500 --> 02:24.300
THE JUICE IS NOT RUNNING.

02:24.367 --> 02:25.033
THE CANDIDATE IN QUESTION IS

02:25.100 --> 02:25.967
THIS GUY, DON BLANKENSHIP, WHO

02:26.033 --> 02:27.400
USED TO RUN A COAL COMPANY

02:27.467 --> 02:28.400
CALLED MASSEY ENERGY, WHICH I

02:28.467 --> 02:30.700
KNOW IS SURPRISING, BECAUSE HE

02:30.767 --> 02:31.867
DOES LOOKS MORE LIKE THE

02:31.934 --> 02:33.867
BUTLER FOR A FAMILY OF GHOSTS.

02:33.934 --> 02:34.800
WE'VE ACTUALLY DISCUSSED

02:34.867 --> 02:35.533
BLANKENSHIP BEFORE ON THIS SHOW,

02:35.600 --> 02:38.800
SPECIFICALLY THE FACT THAT ONE

02:38.867 --> 02:40.633
OF HIS COMPANY'S MINES HAD AN

02:40.700 --> 02:41.166
EXPLOSION IN

02:41.233 --> 02:42.200
2010 THAT KILLED 29 WORKERS.

02:42.266 --> 02:42.767
AND WHILE BLANKENSHIP DENIES

02:42.834 --> 02:43.133
RESPONSIBILITY,

02:43.200 --> 02:44.567
HE WAS CONVICTED OF CONSPIRING

02:44.633 --> 02:46.066
TO VIOLATE FEDERAL SAFETY

02:46.133 --> 02:47.633
STANDARDS IN THE WAKE OF THAT

02:47.700 --> 02:48.633
DISASTER AND SUBSEQUENTLY SERVED

02:48.700 --> 02:50.300
A YEAR IN PRISON.

02:50.367 --> 02:52.333
AND IF YOU THINK HE'D WANT TO

02:52.400 --> 02:54.200
STEER AWAY FROM ANY TALK OF WHAT

02:54.266 --> 02:55.200
I JUST SAID IN HIS ADS, THINK

02:55.266 --> 02:56.633
AGAIN.

02:56.700 --> 02:57.900
>> DID YOU KNOW DON

02:57.967 --> 03:00.567
BLANKENSHIP'S TRIAL WAS NOT

03:00.633 --> 03:01.300
>> REALLY?

03:01.367 --> 03:02.000
YOU SURE?

03:02.066 --> 03:03.433
>> OH, YEAH.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.800
THE OBAMA JUDGE WOULDN'T EVEN

03:04.867 --> 03:06.333
LET DON MENTION THE EXPLOSION.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.600
AND THE OBAMA PROSECUTORS KNEW

03:07.667 --> 03:08.467
DON HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

03:08.533 --> 03:09.734
EXPLOSION.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.633
>> WEST VIRGINIANS KNEW THAT

03:11.700 --> 03:13.133
OBAMA WAS AGAINST THEM AND COAL.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.400
NOW THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT

03:14.467 --> 03:16.166
HAPPENED WHEN DON FOUGHT BACK.

03:16.233 --> 03:17.400
>> I'M VOTING FOR DON.

03:17.467 --> 03:18.333
>> NOW THAT I KNOW THE WHOLE

03:18.400 --> 03:23.567
TRUTH, ME TOO.

03:23.633 --> 03:25.834
>> John: COOL.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.266
NOW, OF ALL THE INSANE THINGS IN

03:27.333 --> 03:28.834
THAT AD, FROM THAT MAN DRINKING

03:28.900 --> 03:31.100
FROM A CLEARLY EMPTY COFFEE MUG

03:31.166 --> 03:33.667
TO THE TERM "OBAMA JUDGE,"

03:33.734 --> 03:35.066
PERHAPS THE WEIRDEST IS THAT ALL

03:35.133 --> 03:36.667
THOSE TWO PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW IN

03:36.734 --> 03:38.266
ORDER TO VOTE FOR BLANKENSHIP IS

03:38.333 --> 03:40.533
THAT HE DIDN'T BLOW UP A MINE.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.900
THAT'S IT!

03:41.967 --> 03:42.834
THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAID "IS

03:42.900 --> 03:44.000
DON BLANKENSHIP THE GOLDEN STATE

03:44.066 --> 03:45.133
KILLER?"

03:45.200 --> 03:46.166
"NO, THEY CAUGHT THAT GUY!"

03:46.233 --> 03:46.834
"WELL, THAT'S ALL I NEED TO

03:46.900 --> 03:47.567
KNOW.

03:47.633 --> 03:50.734
I'M VOTING FOR DON!"

03:50.800 --> 03:54.567
CHEERS.

03:54.633 --> 03:56.100
AND IF BLANKENSHIP WANTS TO

03:56.166 --> 03:57.400
DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM THAT MINE

03:57.467 --> 03:59.200
EXPLOSION, IT DOESN'T HELP THAT

03:59.266 --> 04:01.133
HE TALKS ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.066
IN FACT, HE RELEASED ANOTHER AD

04:03.133 --> 04:04.800
THIS WEEK, THIS TIME ADDING ON A

04:04.867 --> 04:05.433
BIZARRE SWIPE AT SENATE MAJORITY

04:05.500 --> 04:05.667
LEADER

04:05.734 --> 04:06.400
MITCH MCCONNELL.

04:06.467 --> 04:08.800
AND I'LL WARN YOU, THIS MAN IS

04:08.867 --> 04:10.800
DANGEROUSLY CHARISMATIC.

04:10.867 --> 04:12.166
>> POLITICIANS ARE RUNNING A LOT

04:12.233 --> 04:13.266
OF CRAZY ADS.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.233
THEY BLEW UP THE COAL MINE AND

04:15.300 --> 04:16.667
THEN PUT ME IN PRISON.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.166
NOW THEY'RE RUNNING ADS TO SAY

04:18.233 --> 04:19.100
THE COAL MINE BLEW UP AND I WENT

04:19.166 --> 04:20.467
TO PRISON.

04:20.533 --> 04:22.333
THERE'S NO SURPRISE THERE.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.133
BUT IF YOU WANT JOBS, IF YOU

04:24.200 --> 04:24.934
WANT TO END THE DRUG EPIDEMIC

04:25.000 --> 04:27.100
AND YOU WANT TO PROTECT THE

04:27.166 --> 04:29.200
UNBORN, YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR ME.

04:29.266 --> 04:31.367
ONE OF MY GOALS AS U.S. SENATOR

04:31.433 --> 04:33.800
WILL BE TO DITCH COCAINE MITCH.

04:33.867 --> 04:35.233
WHEN YOU VOTE FOR ME, YOU'RE

04:35.300 --> 04:38.100
VOTING FOR THE SAKE OF THE KIDS.

04:38.166 --> 04:39.533
>> John: YES, HE CALLED

04:39.600 --> 04:41.367
MITCH MCCONNELL "COCAINE MITCH,"

04:41.433 --> 04:44.333
WHICH IS A FAR MORE BADASS NAME

04:44.400 --> 04:45.266
THAN THIS MAN DESERVES.

04:45.333 --> 04:48.333
IT'D BE LIKE IF WE STARTED

04:48.400 --> 04:49.333
CALLING HER

04:49.400 --> 04:50.200
JULIE "SKULLFUCKER" ANDREWS.

04:50.266 --> 04:52.600
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT WORKS.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.500
AS FOR WHERE "COCAINE MITCH"

04:53.567 --> 04:58.100
COMES FROM, IT'S BOTH

04:58.166 --> 04:59.500
COMPLICATED AND EXTREMELY DUMB.

04:59.567 --> 05:00.133
ESSENTIALLY, IT'S GOT SOMETHING

05:00.200 --> 05:00.767
TO DO WITH THE FACT MCCONNELL'S

05:00.834 --> 05:01.667
FATHER-IN-LAW,

05:01.734 --> 05:02.433
JAMES CHAO, OWNS A SHIPPING

05:02.500 --> 05:03.033
COMPANY, AND COCAINE MAY HAVE

05:03.100 --> 05:03.667
BEEN FOUND ON ONE OF HIS

05:03.734 --> 05:04.333
COMPANY'S SHIPS.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.767
THAT'S BASICALLY IT.

05:05.834 --> 05:06.400
BUT BLANKENSHIP IS CLEARLY

05:06.467 --> 05:07.900
CONCERNED ABOUT CHAO.

05:07.967 --> 05:08.800
HE MADE HEADLINES RECENTLY,

05:08.867 --> 05:09.667
SAYING,

05:09.734 --> 05:10.800
"I HAVE AN ISSUE WHEN THE

05:10.867 --> 05:11.667
FATHER-IN-LAW IS A WEALTHY CHINA

05:11.734 --> 05:13.734
PERSON,"

05:13.800 --> 05:14.834
WHICH ON ONE HAND IS PRETTY

05:14.900 --> 05:16.400
RACIST BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

05:16.467 --> 05:16.800
IT'S IMPRESSIVELY

05:16.867 --> 05:19.000
GENDER-NEUTRAL.

05:19.066 --> 05:20.734
SO MAYBE THAT SHOULD BE HIS

05:20.800 --> 05:21.800
CAMPAIGN PLATFORM.

05:21.867 --> 05:23.433
DON BLANKENSHIP: BRINGING RACISM

05:23.500 --> 05:26.400
INTO THE 21ST CENTURY.

05:26.467 --> 05:28.100
BUT FAR FROM BACKING DOWN FROM

05:28.166 --> 05:29.934
THAT TERM, BLANKENSHIP DEFENDED

05:30.000 --> 05:31.700
IT IN HIS SIGNATURE STYLE.

05:31.767 --> 05:34.000
>> I DON'T SEE THIS INSINUATION

05:34.066 --> 05:35.300
BY THE PRESS THAT THERE'S

05:35.367 --> 05:36.233
SOMETHING RACIST ABOUT SAYING

05:36.300 --> 05:37.667
"A CHINA PERSON."

05:37.734 --> 05:39.133
SOME PEOPLE ARE KOREAN PERSONS,

05:39.200 --> 05:39.867
AND SOME OF THEM ARE AFRICAN

05:39.934 --> 05:41.033
PERSONS.

05:41.100 --> 05:44.333
IT'S NOT ANY SLANDER THERE.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.166
>> John: EXCEPT NO ONE HAS EVER

05:46.233 --> 05:48.567
USED ANY OF THOSE PHRASES.

05:48.633 --> 05:49.166
EVER.

05:49.233 --> 05:50.200
AND BY THE WAY, "AFRICAN

05:50.266 --> 05:52.533
PERSONS" SOUNDS LIKE AN ALBUM

05:52.600 --> 05:53.767
PAUL SIMON MADE THAT THE RECORD

05:53.834 --> 05:55.500
LABEL ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY

05:55.567 --> 05:58.333
REFUSED TO RELEASE.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.333
AND LOOK, I KNOW THAT IT'S

05:59.400 --> 06:00.033
TEMPTING TO WRITE

06:00.100 --> 06:02.166
BLANKENSHIP OFF AS A WACKY

06:02.233 --> 06:03.300
OUTLIER, BUT THE TRUTH IS, WHEN

06:03.367 --> 06:05.066
A PARTY MOVES AS FAR TO THE

06:05.133 --> 06:06.133
RIGHT AS REPUBLICANS HAVE, THE

06:06.200 --> 06:07.800
FRINGE GUYS ARE NO LONGER

06:07.867 --> 06:08.934
FRINGE.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.033
THEY POP UP ALL THE TIME,

06:10.100 --> 06:11.567
AND SOMETIMES THEY WIN.

06:11.633 --> 06:12.900
AND BLANKENSHIP IS NOT ONLY

06:12.967 --> 06:15.033
SURGING IN THE POLLS RIGHT NOW,

06:15.100 --> 06:16.166
BUT HE RECENTLY PUT OUT AN AD

06:16.233 --> 06:17.600
DOUBLING DOWN ON EVERYTHING

06:17.667 --> 06:21.033
YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.066
>> SWAMP CAPTAIN MITCH McCONNELL

06:22.133 --> 06:22.734
HAS CREATED MILLIONS OF JOBS FOR

06:22.800 --> 06:24.100
CHINA PEOPLE.

06:24.166 --> 06:24.633
WHILE DOING SO,

06:24.700 --> 06:26.333
MITCH HAS GOTTEN RICH.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.633
IN FACT, HIS CHINA FAMILY HAS

06:27.700 --> 06:28.300
GIVEN HIM TENS OF MILLIONS OF

06:28.367 --> 06:29.834
DOLLARS.

06:29.900 --> 06:30.734
MITCH'S SWAMP PEOPLE ARE NOW

06:30.800 --> 06:31.967
RUNNING FALSE NEGATIVE ADS

06:32.033 --> 06:33.500
AGAINST ME.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.233
THEY ARE ALSO CHILDISHLY CALLING

06:35.300 --> 06:37.100
ME DESPICABLE AND MENTALLY ILL.

06:37.166 --> 06:38.200
THE WAR TO DRAIN THE SWAMP AND

06:38.266 --> 06:39.567
CREATE JOBS FOR WEST VIRGINIA

06:39.633 --> 06:41.834
PEOPLE HAS BEGUN.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.333
I WILL BEAT JOE MANCHIN AND

06:43.400 --> 06:44.500
DITCH COCAINE MITCH

06:44.567 --> 06:48.200
FOR THE SAKE OF THE KIDS.

06:48.266 --> 06:49.033
>> John: WOW.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.133
LOOK, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.

06:50.200 --> 06:50.700
SOMEONE, AT THE VERY LEAST,

06:50.767 --> 06:52.367
PLEASE TELL DON BLANKENSHIP THAT

06:52.433 --> 06:53.367
HE'S ALLOWED TO MAKE FACIAL

06:53.433 --> 06:54.700
EXPRESSIONS WHEN HE TALKS, THAT

06:54.767 --> 06:56.433
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A CHINA

06:56.500 --> 06:58.433
FAMILY, AND THAT STEALING TWO

06:58.500 --> 07:00.066
KIDS FROM A WATERPARK IS NOT AT

07:00.133 --> 07:01.100
ALL WHAT PEOPLE MEAN BY DRAINING

07:01.166 --> 07:03.934
THE SWAMP.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.200
AND NOW THIS.

07:09.266 --> 07:11.100
>> Announcer: AND NOW THE

07:11.166 --> 07:12.266
INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF

07:12.333 --> 07:13.300
COMBINING LOCAL NEWS AND THE

07:13.367 --> 07:18.834
FIFTH OF MAY.

07:18.900 --> 07:19.433
>> BUENOS DIAS.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.834
>> .

07:21.900 --> 07:22.133
>> DIOS MIO.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.834
>> WELCOME.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.000
>> CINCO de MAYO.

07:25.066 --> 07:27.233
>> GRAB YOUR GUACAMOLE AND START

07:27.300 --> 07:28.400
MIXING THE MARGARITAS.

07:28.467 --> 07:32.800
>> HELLO, OR SHOULD WE SAY HOLA.

07:32.867 --> 07:34.300
>> HAPPY CINCO de MAYO.

07:34.367 --> 07:34.467
>>

07:34.533 --> 07:38.233
CINCO de MAYO CELEBRATION.

07:38.300 --> 07:42.700
>> SPANISH FOR THE FIFTH OF MAY.

07:42.767 --> 07:45.900
>> OLE!

07:45.967 --> 07:49.433
>> OLE.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.834
>> HAPPY CINCO de MAYO.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.433
>> OLE.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.867
>> MOLE.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.400
OLE FOR MOLE.

07:58.467 --> 08:01.066
>> COMMEMORATING MEXICO'S

08:01.133 --> 08:03.166
VICTORY OVER THE FRENCH BATTLE

08:03.233 --> 08:03.667
OF THE PUEBLA.

08:03.734 --> 08:07.000
>> IS IT A BIG CELEBRATION IN

08:07.066 --> 08:07.233
MEXICO?

08:07.300 --> 08:09.233
>> NO.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.033
NO.

08:11.100 --> 08:11.700
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:11.767 --> 08:12.467
FOR OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT, WE

08:12.533 --> 08:13.066
THOUGHT WE'D CHECK IN ON THE

08:13.133 --> 08:13.600
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

08:13.667 --> 08:14.166
ONGOING TRUMP SCANDALS WE'VE

08:14.233 --> 08:14.767
BEEN CALLING

08:14.834 --> 08:15.367
"STUPID WATERGATE,"

08:15.433 --> 08:16.800
A STORY WITH ALL THE GRAVITY OF

08:16.867 --> 08:17.400
WATERGATE IF DURING IT, THERE

08:17.467 --> 08:18.934
WAS A GAS LEAK IN THE WHITE

08:19.000 --> 08:19.667
HOUSE, AND NIXON HAD BEEN

08:19.734 --> 08:22.000
REALLY INTO HUFFING GLUE.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.066
WELL, THIS WEEK, STUPID

08:23.133 --> 08:24.600
WATERGATE HAD ANOTHER PLOT TWIST

08:24.667 --> 08:26.433
THANKS TO RUDY GIULIANI, WHO

08:26.500 --> 08:28.033
ONLY JOINED TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM

08:28.100 --> 08:30.600
TWO WEEKS AGO, BUT ON WEDNESDAY

08:30.667 --> 08:31.800
MADE BIG NEWS DURING AN

08:31.867 --> 08:32.600
APPEARANCE ON FOX.

08:32.667 --> 08:33.633
BASICALLY,

08:33.700 --> 08:35.700
TRUMP IS ON RECORD DENYING

08:35.767 --> 08:37.467
KNOWING ABOUT A $130,000 PAYMENT

08:37.533 --> 08:38.967
TO STORMY DANIELS TO KEEP QUIET

08:39.033 --> 08:41.567
ABOUT THEIR ALLEGED AFFAIR.

08:41.633 --> 08:42.400
BUT DESPITE THAT, FOR SOME

08:42.467 --> 08:44.433
REASON, GIULIANI, TRUMP'S

08:44.500 --> 08:47.233
LAWYER, NOW REMEMBER, OFFERED A

08:47.300 --> 08:47.867
WHOLE NEW STORY ABOUT WHERE THE

08:47.934 --> 08:48.934
MONEY CAME FROM THAT EVEN

08:49.000 --> 08:50.600
STARTLED SEAN HANNITY.

08:50.667 --> 08:51.667
>> I'M GIVING YOU A FACT NOW

08:51.734 --> 08:53.367
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

08:53.433 --> 08:56.400
IT'S NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY.

08:56.467 --> 08:57.934
NO CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION,

08:58.000 --> 08:59.433
SO --

08:59.500 --> 09:00.300
>> THEY FUNNELED IT THROUGH

09:00.367 --> 09:01.867
A LAW FIRM.

09:01.934 --> 09:02.934
>> FUNNELED IT THROUGH A LAW

09:03.000 --> 09:03.400
FIRM AND THE PRESIDENT

09:03.467 --> 09:05.734
REPAID IT.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.600
>> OH, I DIDN'T KNOW.

09:06.667 --> 09:07.800
HE DID?

09:07.867 --> 09:10.066
>> YES.

09:10.133 --> 09:10.700
>> THERE'S NO CAMPAIGN FINANCE

09:10.767 --> 09:12.433
LAW.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.300
>> ZERO.

09:13.367 --> 09:14.200
>> John: ZERO.

09:14.266 --> 09:14.967
HE NOT ONLY CONTRADICTED WHAT

09:15.033 --> 09:16.567
HIS CLIENT SAID, HE TOPPED IT

09:16.633 --> 09:17.400
OFF WITH THE DRUNK-SOUNDING

09:17.467 --> 09:18.667
"ZERO" OF A MAN SAYING

09:18.734 --> 09:20.033
"MY GIRLFRIEND LEFT ME, BUT

09:20.100 --> 09:20.767
GUESS HOW MANY FUCKS

09:20.834 --> 09:22.233
THIS GUY GIVES?

09:22.300 --> 09:27.567
ZERO!"

09:27.633 --> 09:29.333
NOW, IN SAYING THAT, GIULIANI

09:29.400 --> 09:30.133
MAY HAVE JUST EXPOSED TRUMP

09:30.200 --> 09:30.834
TO MULTIPLE NEW LEGAL

09:30.900 --> 09:32.100
AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS.

09:32.166 --> 09:33.133
BUT HE WASN'T DONE.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.467
BECAUSE DURING HIS MEDIA BLITZ,

09:34.533 --> 09:35.834
HE ALSO UNDERCUT THE WHITE

09:35.900 --> 09:36.934
HOUSE'S OFFICIAL LINE ON WHY

09:37.000 --> 09:38.567
JAMES COMEY WAS FIRED,

09:38.633 --> 09:39.433
PREMATURELY ANNOUNCED THE

09:39.500 --> 09:40.900
RELEASE OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES

09:40.967 --> 09:42.367
FROM NORTH KOREA, SOMETHING

09:42.433 --> 09:43.633
THAT, AS OF THIS TAPING, HAS

09:43.700 --> 09:45.100
STILL NOT HAPPENED, AND MADE

09:45.166 --> 09:46.567
THIS CREEPY COMMENT ABOUT WHAT

09:46.633 --> 09:48.834
WOULD HAPPEN IF PROSECUTORS

09:48.900 --> 09:49.734
TARGETED TRUMP'S DAUGHTER.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.100
>> I THINK I WOULD GET ON MY

09:52.166 --> 09:54.567
CHARGER AND GO RIGHT INTO THEIR

09:54.633 --> 09:55.667
OFFICES WITH A LANCE IF THEY GO

09:55.734 --> 09:56.667
AFTER IVANKA.

09:56.734 --> 09:58.500
>> WHAT ABOUT HIS SON-IN-LAW,

09:58.567 --> 10:00.133
THEY TALK ABOUT HIM.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.000
>> I GUESS JARED IS A FINE MAN,

10:01.066 --> 10:03.900
YOU KNOW THAT.

10:03.967 --> 10:05.000
BUT MEN ARE, YOU KNOW,

10:05.066 --> 10:06.800
DISPOSABLE.

10:06.867 --> 10:07.900
BUT A FINE WOMAN LIKE IVANKA?

10:07.967 --> 10:10.734
COME ON.

10:10.800 --> 10:16.333
>> John: OKAY, SETTING ASIDE THE

10:16.400 --> 10:17.233
SLEAZINESS OF CALLING IVANKA A

10:17.300 --> 10:18.567
"FINE WOMAN," LET'S NOT FORGET

10:18.633 --> 10:19.867
THAT HE ALSO JUST CALLED A

10:19.934 --> 10:21.433
LIVING HUMAN BEING "DISPOSABLE."

10:21.500 --> 10:22.300
WHICH IS PRETTY HARSH.

10:22.367 --> 10:23.233
BUT ALSO...

10:23.300 --> 10:25.900
EH, IT'S JARED, YA KNOW?

10:25.967 --> 10:27.000
IT'S JARED.

10:27.066 --> 10:27.834
HE'S BASICALLY A 6'3" STACK OF

10:27.900 --> 10:29.400
PACKING PEANUTS.

10:29.467 --> 10:32.266
IT'S JARED.

10:32.333 --> 10:35.433
HE IS USELESS.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.300
GIULIANI'S INTERVIEW WAS SO

10:36.367 --> 10:36.934
ILL-ADVISED AND CHAOTIC, IT LEFT

10:37.000 --> 10:37.734
MANY PEOPLE ON TV WONDERING WHAT

10:37.800 --> 10:38.300
EXACTLY HAD BECOME OF HIM.

10:38.367 --> 10:38.934
>> IT'S A LONG WAY FROM

10:39.000 --> 10:39.834
AMERICA'S MAYOR AFTER 9/11.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.000
>> THERE IS SOMETHING OFF ABOUT

10:41.066 --> 10:42.567
RUDY GIULIANI.

10:42.633 --> 10:44.200
THIS IS NOT THE RUDY GIULIANI WE

10:44.266 --> 10:45.367
KNOW.

10:45.433 --> 10:47.200
>> I MEAN, THIS IS SHOCKING

10:47.266 --> 10:48.433
COMING FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS THE

10:48.500 --> 10:49.667
POST 9/11 MAYOR OF NEW YORK

10:49.734 --> 10:50.934
CITY.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.700
> AFTER 9/11, I THINK GIULIANI

10:52.767 --> 10:54.100
HAD A TON OF CREDIBILITY WITH

10:54.166 --> 10:55.100
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

10:55.166 --> 10:56.900
OVER THIS PAST WEEK, IT SEEMS

10:56.967 --> 10:58.500
LIKE THAT'S KIND OF ALL WORN

10:58.567 --> 11:03.567
OFF.

11:03.633 --> 11:04.800
>> John: EXACTLY, PEOPLE SEEM TO

11:04.867 --> 11:06.066
BE AS SHOCKED AT FINDING OUT WHO

11:06.133 --> 11:07.133
GIULIANI REALLY IS AS A CHILD AT

11:07.200 --> 11:08.033
DISNEYWORLD WHO ACCIDENTALLY SAW

11:08.100 --> 11:08.800
MICKEY MOUSE PULL OFF HIS HEAD

11:08.867 --> 11:09.867
TO REVEAL HE WAS ACTUALLY

11:09.934 --> 11:12.900
TILDA SWINTON.

11:12.967 --> 11:13.900
NOT ONLY ARE YOU NOT WHAT I

11:13.967 --> 11:17.834
THOUGHT YOU WERE A MOMENT AGO,

11:17.900 --> 11:19.467
YOU'RE FUCKING TERRIFYING.

11:19.533 --> 11:23.867
AND IF ANY PART OF YOU IS ALSO

11:23.934 --> 11:25.100
WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED

11:25.166 --> 11:25.900
TO RUDY GIULIANI, TONIGHT, WE'RE

11:25.967 --> 11:26.567
GOING TO TRY AND ANSWER THAT FOR

11:26.633 --> 11:26.934
YOU.

11:27.000 --> 11:27.700
BECAUSE THE SHORT ANSWER IS:

11:27.767 --> 11:28.100
NOTHING.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.066
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY.

11:30.133 --> 11:30.967
AND I KNOW THAT MAY BE A LITTLE

11:31.033 --> 11:32.166
JARRING TO HEAR, BECAUSE THE

11:32.233 --> 11:34.600
THING HE'S MOST FAMOUS FOR IS

11:34.667 --> 11:36.200
BEING MAYOR OF NEW YORK ON 9/11,

11:36.266 --> 11:38.233
AFTER WHICH HE WAS RIGHTLY

11:38.300 --> 11:39.233
CELEBRATED FOR BEING A CALM,

11:39.300 --> 11:40.066
STEADY PRESENCE.

11:40.133 --> 11:40.633
HE WAS TIME'S PERSON OF THE

11:40.700 --> 11:41.500
YEAR.

11:41.567 --> 11:42.133
HE RECEIVED AN

11:42.200 --> 11:43.500
HONORARY KNIGHTHOOD FROM GREAT

11:43.567 --> 11:44.734
BRITAIN, AND ITS CLOSEST

11:44.800 --> 11:46.233
AMERICAN EQUIVALENT: BEING

11:46.300 --> 11:48.800
PLAYED IN A MADE-FOR-TV MOVIE BY

11:48.867 --> 11:50.967
MR. JAMES WOODS.

11:51.033 --> 11:52.066
>> DEMOCRATS ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT

11:52.133 --> 11:54.467
THINGS GETTING BETTER.

11:54.533 --> 11:55.367
REPUBLICANS DID WHATEVER THEY

11:55.433 --> 12:04.066
COULD TO MAKE THEM BETTER.

12:04.133 --> 12:05.467
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR,

12:05.533 --> 12:14.100
RIGHT?

12:14.166 --> 12:18.533
>> John: HOT.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.266
RIGHT, RIGHT?

12:19.333 --> 12:20.667
I MEAN, COME ON.

12:20.734 --> 12:21.934
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO WATCH JAMES

12:22.000 --> 12:23.233
WOODS AND THE LADY FROM

12:23.300 --> 12:24.433
"KINDERGARTEN COP" TRADE

12:24.500 --> 12:26.200
REPUBLICAN-THEMED PILLOW TALK ON

12:26.266 --> 12:27.900
A GREEN-SCREENED BEACH BEFORE

12:27.967 --> 12:28.734
EXCHANGING THE MOST SEXLESS KISS

12:28.800 --> 12:30.900
IN THE HISTORY OF FILM?

12:30.967 --> 12:32.200
HOW DID THAT NOT WIN ALL THE

12:32.266 --> 12:33.533
AWARDS?

12:33.600 --> 12:34.734
BUT TO TRULY UNDERSTAND

12:34.800 --> 12:35.433
GIULIANI, YOU HAVE TO GO BACK

12:35.500 --> 12:37.834
BEFORE 9/11.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.967
HE FIRST MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF

12:40.033 --> 12:41.200
AS A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, WHERE

12:41.266 --> 12:42.333
HE ACQUIRED A DEEP AND LASTING

12:42.400 --> 12:43.367
TASTE FOR THE LIMELIGHT,

12:43.433 --> 12:45.033
PERFORMING STUNTS LIKE GOING

12:45.100 --> 12:46.500
UNDERCOVER TO BUY CRACK WHILE

12:46.567 --> 12:49.000
DRESSED IN A HELL'S ANGELS VEST

12:49.066 --> 12:50.100
AND A WHITE DRESS SHIRT.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.500
WHICH MADE HIM LOOK LESS LIKE A

12:51.567 --> 12:53.400
STREET JUNKIE AND MORE LIKE THE

12:53.467 --> 12:54.633
THIRD BEST MEMBER OF AN ALL-DAD

12:54.700 --> 12:55.433
BLUES BAND CALLED

12:55.500 --> 12:58.100
DAD TO THE BONE.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.900
HE EVENTUALLY DECIDED TO RUN FOR

12:59.967 --> 13:00.867
MAYOR, WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT RISKY

13:00.934 --> 13:02.166
AT THE TIME, DUE TO SOME

13:02.233 --> 13:04.133
SUBSTANTIAL BAGGAGE.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.300
AN INTERNAL DOCUMENT PRODUCED BY

13:05.367 --> 13:06.734
HIS OWN CAMPAIGN FLAGGED A

13:06.800 --> 13:08.867
"WEIRDNESS FACTOR" AROUND HIM,

13:08.934 --> 13:10.767
BECAUSE -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

13:10.834 --> 13:12.133
HIS FIRST MARRIAGE WAS TO HIS

13:12.200 --> 13:13.667
SECOND COUSIN.

13:13.734 --> 13:14.867
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:14.934 --> 13:16.266
AMERICA'S MAYOR WAS A

13:16.333 --> 13:19.667
CUZ-NUZZLER.

13:19.734 --> 13:21.633
BUT DON'T WORRY, HE HAS AN

13:21.700 --> 13:23.066
EXCUSE FOR THAT.

13:23.133 --> 13:24.433
>> GIULIANI SAYS THEY ONLY

13:24.500 --> 13:25.900
DISCOVERED THEIR FAMILY RELATION

13:25.967 --> 13:28.934
AFTER MANY YEARS OF MARRIAGE.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.700
>> John: OH, BULLSHIT!

13:30.767 --> 13:32.700
HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS WEIRD AT

13:32.767 --> 13:33.467
THE WEDDING CEREMONY WHEN ONE

13:33.533 --> 13:34.767
SIDE OF THE CHURCH

13:34.834 --> 13:36.734
WAS BOTH FAMILIES AND THE OTHER

13:36.800 --> 13:37.700
WAS JUST ONE VERY NERVOUS

13:37.767 --> 13:38.433
PHOTOGRAPHER

13:38.500 --> 13:39.166
WHO DIDN'T TAKE A SINGLE

13:39.233 --> 13:41.967
PICTURE?

13:42.033 --> 13:43.934
NOW, NEVERTHELESS, GIULIANI WAS

13:44.000 --> 13:46.433
ELECTED, AND AS MAYOR, CONTINUED

13:46.500 --> 13:47.800
HIS LOVE OF THE CAMERA, SHOWING

13:47.867 --> 13:48.300
UP EVERYWHERE, FROM

13:48.367 --> 13:53.000
THE WHOOPI GOLDBERG MOVIE

13:53.066 --> 13:53.734
"EDDIE" TO AN EPISODE OF

13:53.800 --> 13:54.867
"LAW & ORDER" TO

13:54.934 --> 13:55.467
BILL COSBY'S CBS SITCOM,

13:55.533 --> 13:56.834
WHICH HAS NOT DATED BADLY IN ANY

13:56.900 --> 13:58.734
SHAPE OR FORM!

13:58.800 --> 13:59.767
BUT WHAT MANY NEW YORKERS

13:59.834 --> 14:00.567
REMEMBER MOST ABOUT THE GIULIANI

14:00.633 --> 14:01.834
YEARS WAS HIS UNRELENTINGLY

14:01.900 --> 14:03.033
ABRASIVE PERSONAL STYLE.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.533
HE HAD A WEEKLY LOCAL RADIO

14:05.600 --> 14:06.600
SHOW WHERE HE WOULD TAKE CALLS

14:06.667 --> 14:09.533
FROM CONSTITUENTS.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.734
WHICH SHOULD BE EASY TO DO --

14:10.800 --> 14:11.934
JUST LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERNS,

14:12.000 --> 14:12.967
AND POLITELY DISAGREE WHEN

14:13.033 --> 14:13.834
NECESSARY.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.100
BUT JUST LISTEN TO THIS EXCHANGE

14:15.166 --> 14:16.166
WITH A FERRET OWNER ANNOYED BY

14:16.233 --> 14:16.834
THE CITY'S BAN ON OWNING THEM AS

14:16.900 --> 14:18.300
PETS.

14:18.367 --> 14:19.000
>> THERE'S SOMETHING DERANGED

14:19.066 --> 14:20.000
ABOUT YOU.

14:20.066 --> 14:21.667
>> NO, THERE ISN'T, SIR.

14:21.734 --> 14:24.700
>> YOU --

14:24.767 --> 14:28.166
>> THE LAW STATES --

14:28.233 --> 14:30.300
>> THE EXCESSIVE CONCERN --

14:30.367 --> 14:30.934
THAT YOU HAVE FOR FERRETS IS

14:31.000 --> 14:32.967
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD EXAMINE

14:33.033 --> 14:34.233
WITH A THERAPIST.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.333
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER,

14:35.400 --> 14:36.200
DAVID.

14:36.266 --> 14:36.867
THANK YOU.

14:36.934 --> 14:37.600
THIS EXCESSIVE CONCERN WITH

14:37.667 --> 14:41.934
LITTLE WEASELS IS A SICKNESS.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.166
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S

14:43.233 --> 14:44.266
THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK ACTIVELY

14:44.333 --> 14:45.433
CHOOSING TO INSULT A NEW YORKER

14:45.500 --> 14:46.500
WHOSE ONLY CRIME WAS BEING A FAN

14:46.567 --> 14:48.500
OF FERRETS.

14:48.567 --> 14:49.133
AND I'M SURE THAT, WHEN HE WAS

14:49.200 --> 14:50.133
GIVEN THE CHANCE TO PRESENT HIS

14:50.200 --> 14:53.533
SIDE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, THAT

14:53.600 --> 14:54.033
HE WAS COMPLETELY

14:54.100 --> 14:54.667
REASONABLE.

14:54.734 --> 14:55.533
>> DAVID, THANKS FOR COMING ON.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.200
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT,

14:56.266 --> 14:56.667
TUCKER.

14:56.734 --> 14:57.633
>> YOU HAVE IN YOUR HANDS, MY

14:57.700 --> 14:59.500
NOTES HERE SAY, ONE FERRET IS

14:59.567 --> 15:03.133
NAMED MASTER LINUS VAN PELT AND

15:03.200 --> 15:03.800
THE OTHER, PRINCESS KATIE MINI

15:03.867 --> 15:04.567
MITTS.

15:04.633 --> 15:05.967
>> AND THAT'S HER!

15:06.033 --> 15:06.667
>> John: FUCK IT, I HATE TO SAY

15:06.734 --> 15:07.233
IT, BUT I THINK I'M ON

15:07.300 --> 15:15.533
GIULIANI'S SIDE.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.400
I'M ON TEAM GIULIANI.

15:16.467 --> 15:17.000
IT TURNS OUT FERRET ADVOCATES

15:17.066 --> 15:18.033
ARE A LOT LIKE A FERRETS.

15:18.100 --> 15:18.667
I THOUGHT I'D LIKE THEM, THEN I

15:18.734 --> 15:19.400
SAW ONE, AND NOW I'M NOT SO

15:19.467 --> 15:20.033
SURE.

15:20.100 --> 15:20.667
BUT IT WENT WELL BEYOND PICKING

15:20.734 --> 15:22.033
FIGHTS WITH FERRET ENTHUSIASTS.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.367
GIULIANI ADOPTED A FAMOUSLY

15:23.433 --> 15:25.000
TOUGH-ON-CRIME STANCE, WITH A

15:25.066 --> 15:26.166
SEVERELY INCREASED POLICE

15:26.233 --> 15:27.667
PRESENCE, AND AN AGGRESSIVE

15:27.734 --> 15:28.834
CRACKDOWN ON SO-CALLED "QUALITY

15:28.900 --> 15:29.667
OF LIFE CRIMES", LIKE

15:29.734 --> 15:31.500
PANHANDLING AND JAYWALKING.

15:31.567 --> 15:33.133
NOW, THIS APPROACH ANTAGONIZED A

15:33.200 --> 15:35.166
LOT OF PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE

15:35.233 --> 15:36.467
OF COLOR.

15:36.533 --> 15:38.233
MANY REMEMBER IT AS A TIME WHEN

15:38.300 --> 15:39.333
THE POLICE WERE LICENSED TO DO

15:39.400 --> 15:40.667
WHATEVER THEY WANTED --

15:40.734 --> 15:42.433
A CRITICISM EVEN SHARED BY SOME

15:42.500 --> 15:44.100
FORMER COPS.

15:44.166 --> 15:45.533
>> WE WOULD GET A LOT OF FLACK,

15:45.600 --> 15:46.800
"AW, YOU'RE JUST DOING THIS

15:46.867 --> 15:48.667
BECAUSE GIULIANI IS LETTING YOU

15:48.734 --> 15:50.300
DO THIS," AND IN MY HEART I KNEW

15:50.367 --> 15:52.033
IT WAS TRUE.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.900
IF POLICE OFFICERS WERE JUST

15:54.967 --> 15:56.100
EVERY SINGLE PERSON I WANT TO

15:56.166 --> 15:57.100
STOP YOU, I WANT TO QUESTION

15:57.166 --> 15:59.800
YOU, I WANT TO FRISK YOU, THEN

15:59.867 --> 16:02.967
CIVIL RIGHTS ARE GONE.

16:03.033 --> 16:03.567
>> John: AND THAT'S PRETTY

16:03.633 --> 16:04.433
CHILLING.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.867
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S EASY

16:05.934 --> 16:06.467
TO NAVIGATE NEW YORK STREETS

16:06.533 --> 16:07.266
ANYWAY.

16:07.333 --> 16:11.600
AT WORST, YOU'RE TRYING TO GET

16:11.667 --> 16:12.567
AROUND 14 BELGIAN TOURISTS WHO

16:12.633 --> 16:14.567
DON'T KNOW HOW TO FUCKING WALK

16:14.633 --> 16:15.266
IN A CITY, AND AT BEST YOU

16:15.333 --> 16:16.000
MIGHT BE AMBUSHED BY

16:16.066 --> 16:17.000
BILLY EICHNER.

16:17.066 --> 16:18.533
AND IF YOU ARE NOT UP ON YOUR

16:18.600 --> 16:19.300
MERYL STREEP TRIVIA, YOU DESERVE

16:19.367 --> 16:20.066
EVERYTHING HE'S ABOUT TO GIVE

16:20.133 --> 16:22.600
YOU.

16:22.667 --> 16:24.100
BY THE END OF GIULIANI'S SECOND

16:24.166 --> 16:25.834
TERM, MANY NEW YORKERS WERE SICK

16:25.900 --> 16:27.133
OF HIS BULLSHIT.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.300
AT ONE POINT, HE EVEN HAD TO

16:28.367 --> 16:28.767
MOVE OUT OF THE

16:28.834 --> 16:30.700
MAYOR'S RESIDENCE, AMID

16:30.767 --> 16:32.000
ACCUSATIONS OF AN EXTRAMARITAL

16:32.066 --> 16:33.400
AFFAIR, WHICH HE HANDLED IN THE

16:33.467 --> 16:36.066
WORST POSSIBLE WAY.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.700
>> GIULIANI TOLD THE MEDIA IN AN

16:37.767 --> 16:39.467
EXTRAORDINARY NEWS CONFERENCE

16:39.533 --> 16:40.600
THAT HE INTENDED TO SEPARATE

16:40.667 --> 16:42.400
FROM THE FIRST LADY.

16:42.467 --> 16:44.500
>> WE'VE GROWN, GROWN TO LIVE

16:44.567 --> 16:46.133
INDEPENDENT AND SEPARATE LIVES.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.066
>> HE'D GIVEN NO HEADS-UP TO HIS

16:47.133 --> 16:50.600
WIFE.

16:50.667 --> 16:51.600
>> John: WOW!

16:51.667 --> 16:52.967
THAT IS JUST ABOUT THE MOST

16:53.033 --> 16:54.700
HUMILIATING WAY POSSIBLE TO END

16:54.767 --> 16:57.934
A MARRIAGE OTHER THAN ANNOUNCING

16:58.000 --> 16:58.734
PUBLICLY, "WHOOPS, I BONED MY

16:58.800 --> 17:01.367
COUSIN!"

17:01.433 --> 17:03.000
BUT THEN, OF COURSE, 9/11

17:03.066 --> 17:04.900
HAPPENED, AND ALL WAS FORGOTTEN,

17:04.967 --> 17:06.200
BECAUSE AS "AMERICA'S MAYOR,"

17:06.266 --> 17:06.967
HIS REPUTATION WAS SUDDENLY

17:07.033 --> 17:09.000
SOLID GOLD.

17:09.066 --> 17:10.000
AND UPON LEAVING OFFICE,

17:10.066 --> 17:11.066
HE IMMEDIATELY CASHED IN.

17:11.133 --> 17:12.266
HE WROTE A BOOK.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.867
HE GAVE SPEECHES MAKING AS MUCH

17:13.934 --> 17:15.667
AS $200,000 A POP, AND HE

17:15.734 --> 17:16.934
LAUNCHED A CONSULTING FIRM

17:17.000 --> 17:19.734
CALLED GIULIANI PARTNERS,

17:19.800 --> 17:21.467
A NAME THAT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE

17:21.533 --> 17:22.200
A EUPHEMISM FOR

17:22.266 --> 17:23.567
COUSINS WHO FUCK.

17:23.633 --> 17:24.967
"OH, THEM?

17:25.033 --> 17:25.834
THEY'RE GIULIANI PARTNERS.

17:25.900 --> 17:26.834
IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT AT

17:26.900 --> 17:27.567
THEIR GREAT-GRANDMOTHER'S

17:27.633 --> 17:29.467
FUNERAL.

17:29.533 --> 17:32.667
NANA ALWAYS WAS A MATCH-MAKER!"

17:32.734 --> 17:34.567
HE ALSO BECAME A PARTNER IN A

17:34.633 --> 17:36.467
LAW FIRM, AND OVER THE YEARS,

17:36.533 --> 17:37.800
HIS FIRMS REPRESENTED CLIENTS

17:37.867 --> 17:39.433
SUCH AS A TOBACCO COMPANY,

17:39.500 --> 17:40.633
A PRIVATE PRISON COMPANY,

17:40.700 --> 17:42.066
BANK OF AMERICA,

17:42.133 --> 17:43.633
NEWSCORP, WHO OWNED FOX NEWS,

17:43.700 --> 17:45.367
AND PURDUE PHARMA, THE COMPANY

17:45.433 --> 17:46.133
THAT GOT IN TROUBLE FOR

17:46.200 --> 17:47.000
SUPERCHARGING

17:47.066 --> 17:48.266
THE OPIOID CRISIS.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.567
BASICALLY THE KIND OF COMPANIES

17:49.633 --> 17:50.900
WHOSE LOGOS YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE

17:50.967 --> 17:52.400
ON A NASCAR CAR DRIVEN BY A

17:52.467 --> 17:54.800
HOMICIDAL GRIZZLY BEAR.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.800
AND THEN, IN 2007, GIULIANI

17:56.867 --> 17:58.400
LAUNCHED WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

17:58.467 --> 17:59.133
HIS DESTINY:

17:59.200 --> 18:01.834
A CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT, WHICH

18:01.900 --> 18:04.567
WAS CATASTROPHICALLY BAD.

18:04.633 --> 18:06.233
HE TALKED NONSTOP ABOUT 9/11,

18:06.300 --> 18:07.133
WITH SOME SUPPORTERS EVEN

18:07.200 --> 18:09.233
HOLDING A

18:09.300 --> 18:11.367
$9.11-PER-PERSON FUNDRAISER.

18:11.433 --> 18:12.266
ALL OF WHICH TRIGGERED THIS

18:12.333 --> 18:13.333
MEMORABLE LINE FROM

18:13.400 --> 18:13.967
THEN-CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN DURING

18:14.033 --> 18:17.633
A DEBATE.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.100
>> THERE'S ONLY THREE THINGS HE

18:19.166 --> 18:20.333
MENTIONS IN A SENTENCE: A NOUN,

18:20.400 --> 18:21.266
AND A VERB, AND 9/11. I MEAN,

18:21.333 --> 18:23.333
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.300
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE.

18:25.367 --> 18:26.867
>> John: HE'S RIGHT.

18:26.934 --> 18:28.433
GIULIANI COULD NOT STOP

18:28.500 --> 18:30.333
LEVERAGING 9/11 FOR HIS OWN

18:30.400 --> 18:32.433
ENDS, AS EVIDENCED BY HIS

18:32.500 --> 18:33.834
CLASSIC CHILDREN'S BOOK,

18:33.900 --> 18:34.500
"ONE FISH, TWO FISH,

18:34.567 --> 18:37.066
RED FISH, 9/11".

18:37.133 --> 18:38.266
IN THE END, HIS CAMPAIGN FLAMED

18:38.333 --> 18:40.066
OUT SPECTACULARLY,

18:40.133 --> 18:42.567
HE DIDN'T WIN A SINGLE STATE,

18:42.633 --> 18:44.467
AND HE WENT FROM THE FRONTRUNNER

18:44.533 --> 18:45.533
FOR THE PRESIDENCY TO BEING OUT

18:45.600 --> 18:47.400
OF THE RACE BY JANUARY, HAVING

18:47.467 --> 18:49.100
SPENT AROUND $50 MILLION,

18:49.166 --> 18:51.333
ALL TO END UP WITH PRECISELY

18:51.400 --> 19:00.333
ZERO DELEGATES.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.500
OR, AS HE WOULD PUT IT...

19:03.567 --> 19:07.300
>> ZERO.

19:07.367 --> 19:08.000
>> John: EXACTLY.

19:08.066 --> 19:09.033
AND AFTER THAT COMPLETELY

19:09.100 --> 19:09.667
HUMILIATING PRESIDENTIAL FLOP,

19:09.734 --> 19:10.367
GIULIANI ENDED UP FADING FROM

19:10.433 --> 19:10.967
VIEW, EVENTUALLY WASHING UP IN

19:11.033 --> 19:12.900
D-LIST PLACES LIKE THIS.

19:12.967 --> 19:14.166
>> WE LOVE THE MOB MOVIES

19:14.233 --> 19:20.033
YOU LOVE.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.500
>> FORGET ABOUT IT.

19:21.567 --> 19:22.400
>> AMC MOB WEEK, HOSTED BY RUDY

19:22.467 --> 19:23.033
GIULIANI.

19:23.100 --> 19:23.767
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.033
THAT IS A STEEP FALL.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.300
JUST TEN YEARS AFTER BEING NAMED

19:27.367 --> 19:30.033
"TIME" PERSON OF THE YEAR,

19:30.100 --> 19:31.834
GIULIANI WAS DOING VJ WORK

19:31.900 --> 19:32.500
FOR A CABLE NETWORK'S

19:32.567 --> 19:33.300
EDITED-FOR-TELEVISION

19:33.367 --> 19:38.533
PRESENTATION OF "SCARFACE."

19:38.600 --> 19:39.300
JUST THINK ABOUT HOW CRAZY

19:39.367 --> 19:39.867
THAT IS.

19:39.934 --> 19:42.066
THAT WOULD BE LIKE IF, IN TEN

19:42.133 --> 19:45.667
YEARS, BRAVO ANNOUNCED A

19:45.734 --> 19:46.900
"FUCK BOYS OF THE '90s" MARATHON

19:46.967 --> 19:47.600
HOSTED BY

19:47.667 --> 19:50.400
MALALA YOUSAFZAI.

19:50.467 --> 19:53.700
HOW THE FUCK DID THAT HAPPEN?

19:53.767 --> 19:54.667
WHAT DID I MISS?

19:54.734 --> 19:55.400
CLEARLY, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

19:55.467 --> 19:55.934
GOODWILL HAS SOMEHOW BEEN

19:56.000 --> 19:57.233
SQUANDERED.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.200
WOW.

19:58.266 --> 20:00.867
WOW.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.133
AFTER THAT, GIULIANI FRITTERED

20:03.200 --> 20:05.066
AWAY YEARS AS A RENT-A-QUOTE

20:05.133 --> 20:07.433
PUNDIT ON CABLE NEWS,

20:07.500 --> 20:08.400
SAYING VARIOUS AWFUL THINGS,

20:08.467 --> 20:08.967
AND DIDN'T TRULY JOIN

20:09.033 --> 20:11.133
TRUMP'S ORBIT UNTIL JANUARY

20:11.200 --> 20:15.934
2017, WHEN HE WAS NAMED TRUMP'S

20:16.000 --> 20:16.767
NOW, WHY DID TRUMP GIVE HIM

20:16.834 --> 20:17.266
THE JOB?

20:17.333 --> 20:17.900
WHO KNOWS?

20:17.967 --> 20:18.600
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE GIULIANI

20:18.667 --> 20:19.266
HAD A SECURITY CONSULTING

20:19.333 --> 20:19.867
BUSINESS CALLED

20:19.934 --> 20:23.433
GIULIANI SECURITY AND SAFETY,

20:23.500 --> 20:24.367
DESPITE SEEMINGLY HAVING NO REAL

20:24.433 --> 20:26.500
BACKGROUND IN CYBER-SECURITY.

20:26.567 --> 20:27.433
AND IF YOU WATCH GIULIANI

20:27.500 --> 20:28.200
FOR EVEN TEN SECONDS,

20:28.266 --> 20:29.033
YOU GET THE SENSE HE TRIES TO

20:29.100 --> 20:30.633
CHECK HIS E-MAIL BY OPENING A

20:30.700 --> 20:31.433
WORD DOC AND TYPING:

20:31.500 --> 20:31.967
"HI, GOOGLE.

20:32.033 --> 20:32.934
CHECK E-MAIL.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.100
THANKS, RUDY."

20:35.166 --> 20:37.834
ALTHOUGH THE TRUTH IS, TRUMP'S

20:37.900 --> 20:39.033
REAL AFFECTION FOR GIULIANI

20:39.100 --> 20:39.700
PROBABLY CAME FROM HIS

20:39.767 --> 20:40.333
WILLINGNESS DURING

20:40.400 --> 20:41.300
THE CAMPAIGN TO LEND HIS LAST

20:41.367 --> 20:46.400
SHREDS OF CREDIBILITY TO

20:46.467 --> 20:47.266
VARIOUS POISONOUS NONSENSE

20:47.333 --> 20:47.867
LIKE THIS:

20:47.934 --> 20:48.967
>> IF I DID 1/10 OF WHAT HILLARY

20:49.033 --> 20:51.233
CLINTON DID, I'D BE IN JAIL.

20:51.300 --> 20:53.600
SHE PAID PEOPLE TO CREATE

20:53.667 --> 20:56.000
VIOLENCE AT HIS RALLIES.

20:56.066 --> 20:58.734
SHE SOLD ABOUT 20% OF OUR

20:58.800 --> 21:01.066
URANIUM TO RUSSIA.

21:01.133 --> 21:04.100
I HAVE EIGHT TIMES ONLINE SINCE

21:04.166 --> 21:05.834
JANUARY, IN WHICH SHE'S HAD

21:05.900 --> 21:08.066
MASSIVE COUGHING FITS.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.433
SO GO ONLINE AND PUT DOWN

21:09.500 --> 21:10.800
HILLARY CLINTON ILLNESS, TAKE A

21:10.867 --> 21:13.033
LOOK AT THE VIDEOS FOR YOURSELF.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.567
>> John: NOW OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S

21:14.633 --> 21:15.867
ALL HORSESHIT.

21:15.934 --> 21:16.834
BUT I DO AGREE WITH HIM ON ONE

21:16.900 --> 21:18.166
POINT: YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GO

21:18.233 --> 21:23.266
ONLINE AND VISIT

21:23.333 --> 21:25.800
HillaryClintonIlness.com

21:25.867 --> 21:27.133
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIDEOS,

21:27.200 --> 21:27.734
BECAUSE THEY ARE EYE-OPENING.

21:27.800 --> 21:28.333
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS,

21:28.400 --> 21:35.266
WE BOUGHT THE URL FOR

21:35.333 --> 21:37.834
HillaryClintonIllness.com

21:37.900 --> 21:39.100
AND MADE IT AUTOMATICALLY

21:39.166 --> 21:40.500
REDIRECT TO SOMETHING RUDY

21:40.567 --> 21:41.500
GIULIANI WOULD HATE:

21:41.567 --> 21:42.166
THIS ANIMATION OF TWO FERRETS

21:42.233 --> 21:42.700
FUCKING.

21:42.767 --> 21:43.467
ALSO IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT

21:43.533 --> 21:51.767
GIULIANI SECURITY, OWNED BY

21:51.834 --> 21:53.066
DIDN'T THINK TO BUY THE URL

21:53.133 --> 21:54.166
GIULLIANI-SECURITY.COM, SO WE

21:54.233 --> 21:55.467
NOW OWN THAT AS WELL, AND IT

21:55.533 --> 21:57.266
LINKS TO THE ONLY THING GIULIANI

21:57.333 --> 21:58.266
WOULD HATE MORE THAN TWO FERRETS

21:58.333 --> 21:59.166
FUCKING:

21:59.233 --> 22:00.100
TWO FERRETS WHO ARE COUSINS NOT

22:00.166 --> 22:01.767
FUCKING.

22:01.834 --> 22:03.767
THE SEXUAL TENSION'S UNBEARABLE!

22:03.834 --> 22:06.967
YOU KNOW EACH OTHER SO WELL!

22:07.033 --> 22:08.667
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THIS

22:08.734 --> 22:10.166
IN TOTAL, YOU REALIZE:

22:10.233 --> 22:11.567
GIULIANI'S ROLE AS TRUMP'S

22:11.633 --> 22:12.900
LAWYER ISN'T AN ABERRATION.

22:12.967 --> 22:14.200
EVERYTHING IN HIS LIFE HAS LED

22:14.266 --> 22:15.867
TO THIS.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.333
AND WHILE HE MAY WELL BE

22:17.400 --> 22:18.367
PROVIDING TERRIBLE LEGAL

22:18.433 --> 22:19.600
REPRESENTATION FOR TRUMP, HE'S

22:19.667 --> 22:21.433
ACTUALLY THE MOST HONEST

22:21.500 --> 22:22.400
REPRESENTATION OF HIM IN

22:22.467 --> 22:23.867
GENERAL.

22:23.934 --> 22:25.000
BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT:

22:25.066 --> 22:25.867
THEY'RE BASICALLY

22:25.934 --> 22:27.300
TWO VERSIONS OF THE SAME PERSON.

22:27.367 --> 22:28.533
THEY'RE BOTH NEW YORKERS

22:28.600 --> 22:30.000
COASTING ON THEIR REPUTATIONS,

22:30.066 --> 22:31.367
THEY BOTH HAD THREE MARRIAGES,

22:31.433 --> 22:32.533
NEITHER OF THEM CAN SHUT UP WHEN

22:32.600 --> 22:34.066
IN FRONT OF A CAMERA, AND

22:34.133 --> 22:36.467
PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY,

22:36.533 --> 22:37.633
THEY BOTH WANT TO FUCK IVANKA.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.367
WHICH IS WEIRD FOR TRUMP BECAUSE

22:39.433 --> 22:40.567
IVANKA IS IN HIS FAMILY, AND

22:40.633 --> 22:41.467
IT'S WEIRD FOR GIULIANI BECAUSE

22:41.533 --> 22:48.867
SHE ISN'T.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.333
SO...

22:50.400 --> 22:51.433
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO GIULIANI IS

22:51.500 --> 22:55.734
REALLY NOT THE RIGHT QUESTION.

22:55.800 --> 22:56.834
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS.

22:56.900 --> 22:57.500
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM IS

22:57.567 --> 22:57.900
MORE TO THE POINT.

22:57.967 --> 22:58.633
HE'S NOW THE PUBLIC FACE OF

22:58.700 --> 23:00.834
TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM, AND WHO

23:00.900 --> 23:01.633
KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO COME OF

23:01.700 --> 23:02.533
THAT?

23:02.600 --> 23:03.567
MAYBE HE BRINGS TRUMP DOWN

23:03.633 --> 23:04.767
THROUGH SHEER INCOMPETENCE.

23:04.834 --> 23:05.467
MAYBE HE GETS FIRED IN THE NEXT

23:05.533 --> 23:06.533
TWO WEEKS.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.834
ALTHOUGH, TO BE HONEST, AT THE

23:07.900 --> 23:09.133
RATE WE'RE GOING, HE'S SO

23:09.200 --> 23:10.967
FATALLY FLAWED AS A HUMAN BEING

23:11.033 --> 23:12.567
THAT HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO END

23:12.633 --> 23:13.967
UP PRESIDENT.

23:14.033 --> 23:15.700
ALTHOUGH TO DO THAT, HE'LL NEED

23:15.767 --> 23:17.300
A CAMPAIGN WEBSITE, WHICH HE

23:17.367 --> 23:20.033
MIGHT FIND DIFFICULT.

23:20.100 --> 23:21.400
BECAUSE FOR THE RECORD,

23:21.467 --> 23:23.700
RUDY.

23:23.767 --> 23:24.800
GIULIANI2024.COM IS NO LONGER

23:24.867 --> 23:26.633
AVAILABLE, BECAUSE WE BOUGHT IT,

23:26.700 --> 23:28.233
AND IT LINKS TO A DANCING FERRET

23:28.300 --> 23:30.166
GIVING YOU THE FINGER.

23:30.233 --> 23:38.066
AND NOW THIS.

23:38.133 --> 23:39.533
>> Announcer: AND NOW

23:39.600 --> 23:40.834
"LAST WEEK TONIGHT" SALUTES THE

23:40.900 --> 23:44.700
HORSES WHO DIDN'T WIN THE

23:44.767 --> 23:47.066
KENTUCKY DERBY.

23:47.133 --> 23:49.667
KNOCK IT OFF, PAMELA.

23:49.734 --> 23:51.233
FORWARD, FORWARD, FORWARD.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.633
CUTE VIDEO YOU WILL LIKE.

23:52.700 --> 23:56.600
ARE YOU THERE GOD, IT'S ME, A

23:56.667 --> 23:59.367
HORSE.

23:59.433 --> 24:03.266
I FUCKING LOVE APPLES.

24:03.333 --> 24:05.467
A DRAWING OF THE PROPHET

24:05.533 --> 24:06.300
MOHAMMED.

24:06.367 --> 24:06.667
JUST KIDDING.

24:06.734 --> 24:08.066
IT'S A HORSE.

24:08.133 --> 24:10.266
HELP, I AM TRAPPED IN THIS HORSE

24:10.333 --> 24:12.433
SUIT AND SOMEONE KEEPS WHIPPING

24:12.500 --> 24:13.266
ME.

24:13.333 --> 24:14.467
AND COCAINE MANAGE.

24:14.533 --> 24:16.734
YOU MAY NOT HAVE WON, BUT YOU

24:16.800 --> 24:18.400
ARE ALL STILL HORSES, AND THAT

24:18.467 --> 24:21.000
IS SOMETHING.

24:21.066 --> 24:22.266
>> John: AND FINALLY TONIGHT:

24:22.333 --> 24:24.266
A QUICK UPDATE CONCERNING

24:24.333 --> 24:25.400
ALASKA,

24:25.467 --> 24:26.033
THE STATE SO FAR NORTH IT'S

24:26.100 --> 24:26.600
ALMOST AT THE

24:26.667 --> 24:27.100
EDGE OF OUR PLANET.

24:27.166 --> 24:27.567
#FLATEARTH.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.467
#TRUTH.

24:29.533 --> 24:30.533
YOU MAY REMEMBER, A FEW WEEKS

24:30.600 --> 24:31.734
AGO, WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT

24:31.800 --> 24:32.834
THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY A FEW

24:32.900 --> 24:34.633
REMAINING

24:34.700 --> 24:36.233
BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO STORES,

24:36.300 --> 24:36.900
MOST OF WHICH ARE IN ALASKA, AND

24:36.967 --> 24:37.667
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.

24:37.734 --> 24:38.867
SO TO HELP THEM OUT, WE BOUGHT A

24:38.934 --> 24:39.433
NUMBER OF ITEMS FROM RUSSELL

24:39.500 --> 24:40.433
CROWE'S RECENT

24:40.500 --> 24:41.467
DIVORCE AUCTION, AND AT THE END

24:41.533 --> 24:42.633
OF THE SHOW,

24:42.700 --> 24:43.934
WE ISSUED THE MANAGER OF THE

24:44.000 --> 24:45.200
BLOCKBUSTER IN ANCHORAGE AN

24:45.266 --> 24:47.000
ULTIMATUM, TO CALL US WITHIN 48

24:47.066 --> 24:48.967
HOURS SO WE COULD SEND IT ALL TO

24:49.033 --> 24:50.233
HIM.

24:50.300 --> 24:52.000
WELL, I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS.

24:52.066 --> 24:53.567
HE CALLED.

24:53.633 --> 24:55.300
>> HBO HOST JOHN OLIVER HAS

24:55.367 --> 24:57.467
DELIVERED ON HIS PROMISE, AS

24:57.533 --> 24:59.000
SOME PRIZED MOVIE MEMORABILIA IS

24:59.066 --> 25:01.200
NOW ON DISPLAY IN ANCHORAGE'S

25:01.266 --> 25:03.700
LAST BLOCKBUSTER.

25:03.767 --> 25:04.467
>> YES, JUST IN TIME

25:04.533 --> 25:05.667
FOR TOURIST SEASON.

25:05.734 --> 25:06.934
RUSSELL CROWE'S JOCKSTRAP HAS

25:07.000 --> 25:09.333
ARRIVED AT THE BLOCKBUSTER ON

25:09.400 --> 25:10.533
DEBARR.

25:10.600 --> 25:11.367
A MINI-SHRINE TO RUSSELL

25:11.433 --> 25:12.567
CROWE HAS BEEN ERECTED IN EAST

25:12.633 --> 25:13.700
ANCHORAGE.

25:13.767 --> 25:14.433
>> EVERYBODY ASKS ME, DID THEY

25:14.500 --> 25:15.367
WASH IT?

25:15.433 --> 25:16.533
I DON'T KNOW.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.133
I HOPE THEY DID.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.567
>> John: WELL, I'VE GOT BAD NEWS

25:20.633 --> 25:21.867
FOR YOU, BECAUSE WE DIDN'T.

25:21.934 --> 25:24.667
WE DIDN'T WASH IT AT ALL.

25:24.734 --> 25:25.867
AND YOU PROBABLY SHOULD,

25:25.934 --> 25:26.967
BECAUSE IT'S A DOCUMENTED FACT

25:27.033 --> 25:28.400
THAT RUSSELL CROWE'S 2005

25:28.467 --> 25:34.533
SCROTUM-MUSK WILL ATTRACT BEARS.

25:34.600 --> 25:38.200
THAT'S A FACT, A NATURE FACT.

25:38.266 --> 25:39.000
AND HONESTLY, IF THAT HAD BEEN

25:39.066 --> 25:39.834
THE END OF THE STORY, I'D HAVE

25:39.900 --> 25:40.467
BEEN HAPPY JUST KNOWING THAT WE

25:40.533 --> 25:41.033
TRIED TO HELP THAT STORE BY

25:41.100 --> 25:41.667
DOING SOMETHING BREATHTAKINGLY

25:41.734 --> 25:42.166
STUPID.

25:42.233 --> 25:43.266
BUT AMAZINGLY, THIS STORY

25:43.333 --> 25:44.900
ACTUALLY GETS BETTER.

25:44.967 --> 25:46.200
BECAUSE AFTER OUR SEGMENT,

25:46.266 --> 25:48.266
RUSSELL CROWE TWEETED,

25:48.333 --> 25:49.400
"I AM PLANNING NOW ON HOW TO

25:49.467 --> 25:51.333
BEST USE THE JOHN OLIVER MONEY.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.567
GIVEN HE'S OFTEN SHOWN GENUINE

25:52.633 --> 25:53.900
LOVE FOR AUSTRALIANS AND

25:53.967 --> 25:54.967
AUSTRALIA, IT'S GOT TO BE

25:55.033 --> 25:59.700
SOMETHING SPECIAL,"

25:59.767 --> 26:00.800
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

26:00.867 --> 26:01.533
MAINLY BECAUSE, AS FAR AS I AM

26:01.600 --> 26:02.066
AWARE, I HAVE NEVER SHOWN

26:02.133 --> 26:02.767
GENUINE LOVE FOR

26:02.834 --> 26:04.233
AUSTRALIANS OR AUSTRALIA.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.300
AT MOST, I'VE SHOWN MORBID

26:06.367 --> 26:08.633
CURIOSITY FOR IT, THE WAY

26:08.700 --> 26:09.667
A 9-YEAR-OLD POKES

26:09.734 --> 26:10.533
A DEAD FROG WITH A STICK.

26:10.600 --> 26:11.934
I'M ENDLESSLY FASCINATED AND

26:12.000 --> 26:14.166
GROSSED OUT AT THE SAME TIME.

26:14.233 --> 26:15.867
WELL, THIS WEEK, RUSSELL CROWE

26:15.934 --> 26:18.967
REVEALED HIS PLANS, IN A

26:19.033 --> 26:20.066
SURPRISINGLY WELL-PRODUCED

26:20.133 --> 26:21.500
VIDEO, AND I HAVE TO SAY IT IS

26:21.567 --> 26:23.400
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

26:23.467 --> 26:25.367
THIS IS REAL.

26:25.433 --> 26:26.667
>> G'DAY, WE'RE THE IRWINS, AND

26:26.734 --> 26:28.066
WE'RE HERE AT THE AUSTRALIA ZOO

26:28.133 --> 26:30.467
WILDLIFE HOSPITAL WHERE WE TREAT

26:30.533 --> 26:33.633
SO MANY ANIMALS.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.133
KOALAS RIGHT NOW ARE SUFFERING

26:35.200 --> 26:36.400
A DISEASE CALLED CHLAMYDIA.

26:36.467 --> 26:38.000
IT CAN CAUSE BLINDNESS,

26:38.066 --> 26:39.533
INFERTILITY, AND EVEN COST A

26:39.600 --> 26:42.066
KOALA ITS LIFE.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.500
BUT NOW WE'RE TRIALING A NEW

26:43.567 --> 26:45.000
VACCINE AND THERE IS HOPE FOR

26:45.066 --> 26:46.500
THE FUTURE.

26:46.567 --> 26:48.266
>> ABSOLUTELY, SO THANK YOU SO

26:48.333 --> 26:49.900
MUCH TO RUSSELL CROWE FOR YOUR

26:49.967 --> 26:51.567
AMAZING DONATION TO HELP THESE

26:51.633 --> 26:56.200
KOALAS.

26:56.266 --> 27:00.033
>> John: OKAY, SO.

27:00.100 --> 27:04.000
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS,

27:04.066 --> 27:05.066
THE FRIST ONE BEING

27:05.133 --> 27:05.700
HOW DID ALL OF THOSE KOALAS GET

27:05.767 --> 27:07.000
CHLAMYDIA?

27:07.066 --> 27:08.700
OR I GUESS I SHOULD ASK, WHAT

27:08.767 --> 27:09.367
EXACTLY HAPPENED AFTER THIS

27:09.433 --> 27:10.667
PHOTOSHOOT WITH

27:10.734 --> 27:11.400
HARRY STYLES ON ONE DIRECTION'S

27:11.467 --> 27:17.100
2012 TOUR?

27:17.166 --> 27:17.967
THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION.

27:18.033 --> 27:18.600
AND YOU MIGHT BE THINKING,

27:18.667 --> 27:19.367
"WELL, HOLD ON.

27:19.433 --> 27:20.200
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THE MONEY

27:20.266 --> 27:20.867
YOU SPENT ON HIS ITEMS WENT TO

27:20.934 --> 27:22.433
THOSE KOALAS?"

27:22.500 --> 27:23.700
WELL, THE VIDEO HAD A LITTLE

27:23.767 --> 27:26.667
TWIST AT THE END.

27:26.734 --> 27:27.667
>> AND A BIG THANK YOU

27:27.734 --> 27:29.233
TO JOHN OLIVER FOR BUYING SOME

27:29.300 --> 27:30.133
OF RUSSELL'S INCREDIBLE THINGS

27:30.200 --> 27:32.433
IN HIS AUCTION.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.233
YOU ARE HELPING FOR THE FIGHT

27:34.300 --> 27:35.433
FOR CHLAMYDIA AND A PLAQUE HAS

27:35.500 --> 27:36.600
BEEN ORGANIZED IN YOUR HONOR.

27:36.667 --> 27:41.700
CHECK IT OUT.

27:41.767 --> 27:42.400
>> John: ARE YOU

27:42.467 --> 27:46.567
NOT ENTERTAINED?

27:46.633 --> 27:47.867
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?

27:47.934 --> 27:50.467
WELL PLAYED, RUSSELL CROWE.

27:50.533 --> 27:57.233
WELL PLAYED INDEED.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.500
THAT MAY HONESTLY BE THE

27:58.567 --> 27:59.100
GREATEST THING

27:59.166 --> 27:59.633
I'VE EVER SEEN.

27:59.700 --> 28:00.433
I'LL BE HONEST, BACK WHEN THIS

28:00.500 --> 28:02.033
SHOW STARTED, I WROTE DOWN MY

28:02.100 --> 28:05.600
ONE AND ONLY GOAL FOR IT, AND

28:05.667 --> 28:06.767
I PUT IT IN THIS ENVELOPE.

28:06.834 --> 28:08.433
IT WAS A SIMPLE GOAL, JUST THREE

28:08.500 --> 28:09.233
WORDS LONG.

28:09.300 --> 28:12.033
THAT GOAL?

28:12.100 --> 28:15.200
"A KOALA CHLAMYDIA WARD."

28:15.266 --> 28:16.500
SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS, WE'VE

28:16.567 --> 28:17.266
ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING WE SET

28:17.333 --> 28:19.000
OUT TO DO ON THIS SHOW.

28:19.066 --> 28:20.667
WHICH MEANS

28:20.734 --> 28:22.667
THANKS VERY MUCH, EVERYONE.

28:22.734 --> 28:23.567
BUT WE ARE FUCKING DONE HERE.

28:23.633 --> 28:26.266
THAT'S RIGHT.

28:26.333 --> 28:33.667
THIS SHOW'S OVER.

28:33.734 --> 28:35.834
DON'T THINK OF THIS AS A SAD

28:35.900 --> 28:36.734
OCCASION, BECAUSE I LEAVE YOU IN

28:36.800 --> 28:38.133
TOTAL TRIUMPH.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.734
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED "LAST WEEK

28:39.800 --> 28:42.433
TONIGHT" OVER THE YEARS.

28:42.500 --> 28:42.934
I KNOW WE MADE IT RATHER

28:43.000 --> 28:43.867
DIFFICULT TO DO SO.

28:43.934 --> 28:46.367
BUT WE LEARNED SOME THINGS ALONG

28:46.433 --> 28:47.667
THE WAY, AND WE HAD EXACTLY

28:47.734 --> 28:48.500
4 LAUGHS.

28:48.567 --> 28:49.667
THAT'S SOMETHING.

28:49.734 --> 28:50.700
THE POINT IS, PACK IT UP, GUYS,

28:50.767 --> 28:51.600
WE'RE GOING HOME!

28:51.667 --> 28:55.934
WE DID IT, JEFF!

28:56.033 --> 28:56.800
WE DID IT.

28:56.867 --> 28:57.533
WE GOT THE KOALA WARD!

28:57.600 --> 28:59.533
AND I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE ASKING,

28:59.600 --> 29:00.133
"BUT, JOHN, WASN'T MAKING FOUR

29:00.200 --> 29:02.266
AND A HALF SEASONS OF

29:02.333 --> 29:02.867
AGGRESSIVELY RESEARCHED COMEDY

29:02.934 --> 29:04.066
A FAIRLY INEFFICIENT WAY OF

29:04.133 --> 29:04.867
GETTING A KOALA CHLAMYDIA WARD

29:04.934 --> 29:06.233
NAMED AFTER YOU?"

29:06.300 --> 29:07.533
AND TO THAT I ANSWER,

29:07.600 --> 29:09.066
WELL, IT WORKED.

29:09.133 --> 29:10.467
SO, I GUESS...

29:10.533 --> 29:13.600
FUCK YOU?

29:13.667 --> 29:15.767
I GUESS...

29:15.834 --> 29:16.767
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

29:16.834 --> 29:17.934
I'VE GOT A DATE WITH SOME VERY

29:18.000 --> 29:18.467
CONTAGIOUS KOALAS.

29:18.533 --> 29:19.033
THAT'S OUR SERIES!

29:19.100 --> 29:20.600
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING!

29:20.667 --> 29:24.934
GOODBYE FOREVER!

29:25.000 --> 29:29.800
I REGRET NOTHING!

29:29.867 --> 29:41.266
MY WORK HERE IS DONE!
