ABBY LEE:
<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:02.769 --> 00:04.738
<i>Maddie is shooting a movie,</i>
<i>but I have</i>

00:04.738 --> 00:06.440
<i>the next best thing: Brynn.</i>

00:06.440 --> 00:09.743
Are you kidding me? You never
taught her a (bleep) thing!

00:09.743 --> 00:11.879
ABBY LEE: <i>The minis are gonna</i>
<i>come in today.</i>

00:11.879 --> 00:13.981
If you don't get
your arms up, go home.

00:13.981 --> 00:15.015
JESSALYNN:
<i>Oh, we got a crier.</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:16.583
WOMAN:
Abby Lee Miller,

00:16.583 --> 00:21.054
in serious legal drama,
faces up to five years in jail.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.122
I'm finished!

00:22.122 --> 00:24.258
JILL:
<i>We received an e‐mail</i>

00:24.258 --> 00:25.826
that she's resigning.
What?

00:25.826 --> 00:27.761
JESSALYNN: <i>Abby has quit</i>
<i>on this team again.</i>

00:27.761 --> 00:29.463
JILL: It's not looking good,
you guys.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.000
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:33.000 --> 00:34.902
JILL:
<i>Abby resigned from the team.</i>

00:34.902 --> 00:37.104
ASHLEE: She still wants them
to dance under her name.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.973
I can't imagine her
<i>not</i> coming back.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.643
I am going to teach you
a large group number.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.211
Ha!

00:44.211 --> 00:46.013
Think I'm starting to
get a little nervous now.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.414
Success is a journey.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.483
JESSALYNN: <i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>your kid wasn't really</i>

00:49.483 --> 00:50.584
as good as I thought
she was gonna be.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.486
TIFFANIE:
<i>Peyton was in the corner</i>

00:52.486 --> 00:53.887
going, "Mommy, just stop!"
KERRI: No, she didn't.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.756
Peyton was on my lap,
dumb (bleep).

00:55.756 --> 00:58.725
(gasps)
Your problem is
your kid can't learn the dance.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.294
HOLLY:
<i>Everyone's hitting a wall,</i>

01:00.294 --> 01:01.261
and they have no leader.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.866
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

01:12.606 --> 01:15.542
3rd Street, we meet again!

01:15.542 --> 01:17.177
Talk about full circle.
HOLLY: You know what?

01:17.177 --> 01:19.446
Even though Abby's not here,
I'm glad the girls are here.

01:19.446 --> 01:21.782
JILL:
<i>Abby resigned from the team.</i>

01:21.782 --> 01:23.584
She kicked us out of her studio.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.552
<i>She lives there, literally.</i>

01:25.552 --> 01:29.056
<i>In light of her legal woes,</i>
<i>Abby is an emotional wreck.</i>

01:29.056 --> 01:31.024
<i>Showing up</i>
<i>with her makeup half done</i>

01:31.024 --> 01:32.893
<i>and her hair in curlers,</i>

01:32.893 --> 01:35.162
<i>wasting time,</i>
<i>eating our snacks.</i>

01:35.162 --> 01:37.464
<i>And it's been difficult</i>
<i>for all of us,</i>

01:37.464 --> 01:39.900
<i>but especially for the kids.</i>

01:39.900 --> 01:42.469
<i>Abby's always talking</i>
<i>about her brand.</i>

01:42.469 --> 01:45.639
<i>Let's face it, these children</i>
<i>are part of her brand.</i>

01:45.639 --> 01:47.207
<i>We can't give up.</i>

01:47.207 --> 01:49.843
ASHLEE: She still
wants them to dance

01:49.843 --> 01:51.144
under her name
at competitions?

01:51.144 --> 01:52.212
We're still competing ALDC,

01:52.212 --> 01:54.214
'cause Gia is here.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.583
I think for sure
she will be back.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.852
I can't imagine her
<i>not</i> coming back.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.621
MELISSA:
<i>My girls have danced for Abby</i>

02:00.621 --> 02:02.456
<i>since they were little</i>
<i>three‐year‐olds.</i>

02:02.456 --> 02:03.757
<i>It's hard on Maddie</i>

02:03.757 --> 02:05.959
just because, you know,
she wants to be with her team

02:05.959 --> 02:09.262
<i>to help them, but Maddie's</i>
<i>out filming a movie right now.</i>

02:09.262 --> 02:10.897
<i>She needs to focus on herself.</i>

02:10.897 --> 02:11.932
Oh, you know Nia's not here.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.467
MELISSA:
Where's Nia?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.801
Where? Wha... What?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.872
NIA: Yeah, I have
to go right now.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.741
HOLLY:
<i>As soon as I find Nia,</i>

02:20.741 --> 02:22.009
I could tell something is wrong.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.877
She's definitely upset
about something.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.178
What happened?
(sniffling)

02:30.717 --> 02:31.752
Oh, Nia.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.388
You know people
on social media are cruel.

02:34.388 --> 02:38.492
<i>Nia posted a video</i>
<i>on social media</i>

02:38.492 --> 02:40.227
demonstrating turns,

02:40.227 --> 02:42.029
<i>and it wasn't well received.</i>

02:42.029 --> 02:43.597
<i>That alone is tough,</i>

02:43.597 --> 02:47.634
<i>coupled with the fact that Abby</i>
<i>abandoned the girls again.</i>

02:47.634 --> 02:49.369
<i>Nia is frustrated.</i>

02:49.369 --> 02:50.671
JILL:
You okay, Nia?

02:50.671 --> 02:51.905
HOLLY:
She's fine.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.141
Just some negative stuff
on social media.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.375
It happens.
JILL: You know what? Honey.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.911
(crying)
Oh. Oh.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.579
JILL:
Haters are gonna hate.

02:59.579 --> 03:00.781
Don't let them make you cry.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.282
JILL: Everybody gets it.
You're not alone.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.950
HOLLY:
<i>The stress of Abby being gone</i>

03:03.950 --> 03:05.252
is clearly bothering Nia.

03:05.252 --> 03:06.820
The girls need to be strong

03:06.820 --> 03:08.355
<i>now more than ever.</i>

03:08.355 --> 03:09.723
<i>Their careers cannot fall apart</i>

03:09.723 --> 03:11.658
just because Abby's is.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.427
JILL:
Gia's here.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.262
Hey!
GIANNA:
Hey, guys.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.531
JILL: Hello, peanuts. You guys
have never been here before.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.332
JESSALYNN: Hey.
Hi.
GIANNA: Come on in, guys.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.568
ASHLEE: So did you come
mostly for the girls,

03:21.568 --> 03:24.037
that they're here,
or because Abby told you to?

03:24.037 --> 03:27.074
She had given me the routines
and the competition info,

03:27.074 --> 03:29.443
so we are still
competing as planned.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.778
(chuckles): We'll take it
by day, week by week,

03:31.778 --> 03:33.180
and we'll see.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.047
Okay.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.985
GIANNA: Normally, the
first day of rehearsal,

03:38.985 --> 03:40.287
Abby would have a pyramid
on the wall.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.855
That's not
really my thing.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.725
I'm just here to tell you guys
what's going on this week,

03:44.725 --> 03:46.460
and to get the routine started
as fast as I can.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.928
We are going to FIERCE

03:47.928 --> 03:50.664
Dance Competition
in Lawndale, California.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.232
(girls cheering)

03:52.232 --> 03:54.835
But no solos this week.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.370
Three duets.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.172
(girls exclaiming)
Oh, my God.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.274
GIANNA:
So, the first duet...

04:04.878 --> 04:07.881
Nia and Kalani, you
guys are getting a duet.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.016
(cheering)

04:10.016 --> 04:11.618
It's kind of a spin
on an African routine.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.420
HOLLY:
<i>Hearing that Nia and Kalani</i>

04:13.420 --> 04:15.622
have a duet‐‐ bingo!

04:15.622 --> 04:18.592
<i>She can pull out a win</i>
<i>doing an African dance duet.</i>

04:18.592 --> 04:20.627
<i>I think it will be enough</i>
<i>to give her a little boost</i>

04:20.627 --> 04:23.864
<i>in confidence</i>
<i>after such a harrowing day.</i>

04:23.864 --> 04:25.799
GIANNA: It's something
that I don't

04:25.799 --> 04:28.034
normally do, so
I am going to have

04:28.034 --> 04:29.302
some help with this.

04:29.302 --> 04:32.205
Uh, Travis Payne's assistant,
Aisha Francis,

04:32.205 --> 04:34.541
is gonna come in and
work with you guys.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.176
I am super excited to be working
with Aisha again.

04:36.176 --> 04:39.146
<i>We haven't seen her since</i>
<i>we did our Travis Payne dance.</i>

04:39.146 --> 04:41.681
She was super nice, and she
really pushed us to our fullest.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.417
Next, we're gonna
do a mini duet.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.886
(girls cheering)

04:48.488 --> 04:50.657
It's called "Don't Be
Afraid of the Dark."

04:50.657 --> 04:52.125
It was a routine
that we competed

04:52.125 --> 04:53.326
two or three seasons ago.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.862
<i>It was Asia and Chloe.</i>

04:55.862 --> 04:57.531
And it's going to be
Peyton and Alexus.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.032
(cheering)

05:01.034 --> 05:02.202
PEYTON:
<i>I have to learn</i>

05:02.202 --> 05:04.004
two dances in three days,

05:04.004 --> 05:06.439
but I think I can do it.

05:06.439 --> 05:08.809
I have one more,
who I don't think

05:08.809 --> 05:11.144
has ever been
paired together.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.813
The duet is called
"The Odd Couple."

05:15.649 --> 05:16.950
They already know!

05:16.950 --> 05:18.885
Kendall and Brynn.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.654
(cheering, excited chatter)

05:20.654 --> 05:23.390
Kendall is kind of
the hard‐core,

05:23.390 --> 05:24.491
dark, punk‐rock chick,

05:24.491 --> 05:26.459
while Brynn would be
the complete opposite.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.029
ASHLEE:
So what part

05:29.029 --> 05:30.931
is the harder part exactly?

05:30.931 --> 05:32.666
It's a duet.
They're gonna do the same thing.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.367
It's the same thing?
I was just wondering.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.869
JESSALYNN: She wants Brynn
to have the harder part,

05:35.869 --> 05:37.237
and all the leg tricks

05:37.237 --> 05:39.005
and all that stuff
that the little kids do.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.042
JILL: Maybe you should just
be thankful you have a duet,

05:42.042 --> 05:43.577
because there are
two kids...
I am grateful.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.945
...four kids,
four kids

05:44.945 --> 05:46.713
on this team that
don't have one.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.215
Brynn, if Abby were here,

05:48.215 --> 05:51.151
she would say, "Your mother
just blew it for you."

05:51.151 --> 05:53.386
JILL:
<i>I think Ashlee is so desperate</i>

05:53.386 --> 05:54.988
<i>that she's throwing my kid</i>

05:54.988 --> 05:56.923
under the bus yet again.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.359
<i>This woman is rude.</i>

05:59.359 --> 06:01.461
I gave you guys
a little heads‐up last week

06:01.461 --> 06:04.631
about the group dance, and I
think that's gonna need a lot

06:04.631 --> 06:07.400
more work than
we think it is, so...

06:07.400 --> 06:10.904
For next week,
we are doing a line...

06:10.904 --> 06:12.138
with everyone.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.441
I think that Abby put

06:14.441 --> 06:15.775
all the girls together
for the group dance

06:15.775 --> 06:17.711
<i>because I think</i>
<i>she needs the minis</i>

06:17.711 --> 06:19.512
<i>and the mini moms to realize</i>
<i>if you're gonna be</i>

06:19.512 --> 06:21.248
<i>on this team,</i>
<i>you need to step it up.</i>

06:21.248 --> 06:23.283
I'm actually
gonna bring in

06:23.283 --> 06:25.051
the person that's helping us
with the group

06:25.051 --> 06:26.152
and he can tell
you guys about it.

06:26.152 --> 06:29.189
(girls murmuring)

06:29.189 --> 06:31.625
(cheering)

06:31.625 --> 06:34.194
GIANNA: So this is Nakul
and his assistant Monica.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.330
Well, if you guys
don't know who I am,

06:37.330 --> 06:39.199
I know who you guys are.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.467
I love your team,

06:40.467 --> 06:42.802
and I've been watching
you for many years.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.337
I don't know if you have
been watching me,

06:44.337 --> 06:46.006
but I'm the Bollywood guy on
<i>So You Think You Can Dance.</i>

06:46.006 --> 06:48.608
(cheering)

06:48.608 --> 06:50.977
I am going to teach you

06:50.977 --> 06:53.013
a large group number.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.214
ALL:
Thank you!

06:54.214 --> 06:55.548
So I'm very excited.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.817
Let's get started
doing Bollywood,

06:57.817 --> 07:01.021
because Bollywood's all about
joy and happiness

07:01.021 --> 07:03.890
and we're gonna win first place
with this number.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.892
(cheering)

07:05.892 --> 07:06.993
Namaste!

07:06.993 --> 07:08.361
NAKUL:
Yes!

07:08.361 --> 07:11.531
I'm in love with Nakul.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.600
<i>He's a breath of fresh air.</i>

07:13.600 --> 07:15.068
<i>Their leader has left them.</i>

07:15.068 --> 07:18.338
He is just what
our kids need right now.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.773
<i>I just hope and pray</i>

07:19.773 --> 07:22.575
<i>these minis are gonna keep up</i>
<i>with our girls.</i>

07:25.812 --> 07:27.147
NAKUL:
<i>Did you all know</i>

07:27.147 --> 07:28.715
that you're all playing

07:28.715 --> 07:30.884
little princesses in
my Bollywood number?

07:30.884 --> 07:33.553
You're going to see the prince.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.090
Half our circle
keeps getting wider.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.326
Oh, I kind of miss
our studio right about now.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.694
SARI: What is
going on with that?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.529
I know that she resigned
last week, so she's still...?

07:42.529 --> 07:44.965
MELISSA: Why you guys
still here if she resigned?

07:44.965 --> 07:46.132
That's...
I'm curious about that.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.033
But why are
you here, then?

07:47.033 --> 07:47.934
Because we're here with Gia.

07:47.934 --> 07:48.868
We're part of the team.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.337
Okay, but Gia did
invite us back,

07:50.337 --> 07:51.838
said that we're a part of
the group, and that's why,

07:51.838 --> 07:52.872
I think, I'm here.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.274
JESSALYNN:
It's not rocket science

07:54.274 --> 07:56.076
that there barely is
an elite team,

07:56.076 --> 07:57.711
there's probably not
gonna be a mini team.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.412
TIFFANIE: Every day
we get a group dance,

07:59.412 --> 08:01.581
we're happy with that.

08:01.581 --> 08:03.049
<i>Abby's going through</i>
<i>a lot right now,</i>

08:03.049 --> 08:05.085

and get ready

34:40.579 --> 34:42.213
for the group now?

34:42.213 --> 34:43.782
JESSALYNN: <i>This group dance</i>
<i>is the first time</i>

34:43.782 --> 34:45.517
<i>our girls are competing</i>
<i>with the minis.</i>

34:45.517 --> 34:48.320
Not only is it one of the
hardest dances we've ever done,

34:48.320 --> 34:51.256
<i>but without Abby here,</i>
<i>it's been chaotic.</i>

34:51.256 --> 34:53.792
<i>Kerri had a huge meltdown.</i>

34:53.792 --> 34:56.628
<i>The mini moms have been</i>
<i>at each other's throats,</i>

34:56.628 --> 34:57.996
and I don't know
if they're ready for this.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.165
(gasps)

35:00.165 --> 35:01.399
Hi!

35:01.399 --> 35:02.968
ALL:
Hey!

35:02.968 --> 35:03.969
NAKUL:
Oh, my gosh.

35:03.969 --> 35:04.970
Look at you guys.

35:04.970 --> 35:07.939
Namaste!

35:07.939 --> 35:09.174
ALL:
Namaste.

35:09.174 --> 35:10.408
Yay.

35:10.408 --> 35:12.477
Gather round. Come here.
I need to talk to you guys.

35:12.477 --> 35:14.145
We have to deliver.

35:14.145 --> 35:15.513
Not just because it's you,

35:15.513 --> 35:17.582
but because you're doing
something so cultural.

35:17.582 --> 35:19.517
Now, that's just one angle.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.886
The second angle is
Mr. Nakul has a reputation.

35:21.886 --> 35:25.323
And I usually
never put anything on stage

35:25.323 --> 35:27.959
until it's ready.

35:27.959 --> 35:28.893
Are you ready?
GIRLS: Yes!

35:28.893 --> 35:30.829
Do you feel ready?
Yes!

35:30.829 --> 35:32.597
Are you gonna do this?
Yes!

35:32.597 --> 35:34.499
All right.
Girls, we're all walking!

35:34.499 --> 35:35.500
Let's go!

35:35.500 --> 35:37.235
Moms and girls, here we go!

35:37.235 --> 35:39.571
KERRI: <i>I've been freaking out</i>
<i>over this dance.</i>

35:39.571 --> 35:41.806
I'm freaking out about
everything this week.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.341
<i>I'm scared.</i>

35:43.341 --> 35:46.177
<i>Even though Abby's not there,</i>
<i>Abby sees everything.</i>

35:46.177 --> 35:48.613
I don't want all the moms
to blame her for messing up.

35:48.613 --> 35:50.148

36:07.032 --> 36:08.833

to make it through here.

36:27.485 --> 36:29.220
<i>The kids are stressed.</i>

36:29.220 --> 36:31.056
<i>They've got a lot</i>

36:31.056 --> 36:32.824
<i>Now Abby has these minis</i>

36:32.824 --> 36:35.493
<i>dancing with our kids</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

36:35.493 --> 36:37.529

JILL: <i>I really was impressed</i>
<i>with the group dance.</i>

38:39.317 --> 38:41.853
All the kids together
looked great.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.888
<i>There were a couple little kids</i>

38:43.888 --> 38:47.025

TIFFANIE: <i>Alexus's future's</i>
<i>really on the line.</i>

39:05.610 --> 39:06.878
We're not a team right now,

39:06.878 --> 39:08.813
and if we ever want
to become a team,

39:08.813 --> 39:10.181
<i>we need to win for Abby.</i>

39:10.181 --> 39:12.617
We have a top champion:

39:12.617 --> 39:14.652

of the Dark."

39:14.652 --> 39:17.455

39:17.455 --> 39:20.592
KERRI: <i>I'm super proud</i>

39:20.592 --> 39:22.093
<i>She's meant to perform,</i>

39:22.093 --> 39:24.095
<i>she's meant to make</i>
<i>other people laugh and smile</i>

39:24.095 --> 39:26.898

she can do at such a young age.

ASHLEE: <i>We didn't come here</i>
<i>to get third place.</i>

39:47.886 --> 39:50.488
I think Jill totally needs
to stop protecting Kendall.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.757
<i>It is not doing her good.</i>

39:52.757 --> 39:54.025
The more everybody babies her,

the worse and worse
she's gonna get.

Our little team,

41:05.363 --> 41:07.332
<i>which has grown</i>
<i>with these minis,</i>

41:07.332 --> 41:08.333
came out on top.

41:10.568 --> 41:13.071
Congratulations to all of you.
I'm very, very happy.

41:13.071 --> 41:16.007
Thank you for bringing
this art form to our girls.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.375
Thank you.

41:18.443 --> 41:20.044
The girls proved to everyone

41:20.044 --> 41:24.182
<i>that they can win without Abby,</i>
<i>with any style of dance.</i>

41:24.182 --> 41:25.183
As crazy as

41:25.183 --> 41:26.584
this experience is,

41:26.584 --> 41:27.885
all of you new moms

41:27.885 --> 41:29.220
need to learn
to work as a team.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.322
HOLLY: It could be
a defining moment for you.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.690
Or it might be not be for you.
So...

41:32.690 --> 41:34.492
It takes tough moms

41:34.492 --> 41:36.327
and tough kids
to make it through here.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.428
Honestly,
you may not make it.

41:37.428 --> 41:38.196
This is not easy.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.372
KERRI:
But we have to have

41:47.372 --> 41:48.439
a unified group.

41:48.439 --> 41:49.807
What do we have to lose?
MARY:
Right.

41:49.807 --> 41:51.142
My sanity.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.983
Hello, ladies.

41:58.983 --> 42:00.118
You were gone last week.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.285
Are you back

42:01.285 --> 42:03.287
for good this week?
No.

42:03.287 --> 42:04.589
HOLLY:
<i>This is ridiculous!</i>

42:04.589 --> 42:06.090
I think you've lost your mind!

42:06.090 --> 42:08.192
JESSALYNN:
Oh.

42:08.192 --> 42:09.427
We have a mini!

42:09.427 --> 42:10.595
I just need to know
if we're staying...

42:10.595 --> 42:12.296
Do you want your kid
in the routine or not?

42:12.296 --> 42:14.599
I do.
Then get out of here right now!

42:14.599 --> 42:16.134
MELISSA: <i>Abby Lee Miller</i>
<i>runs the show, you don't.</i>

42:16.134 --> 42:17.602
And she'll never let you
run the show.

42:18.736 --> 42:20.438
I felt like Kendall didn't care.

42:20.438 --> 42:22.774
(bleep) you. You are so (bleep)
desperate, it's sickening.
