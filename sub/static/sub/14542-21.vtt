Tell him I'm busy.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.957

the boiler having a leak, though.

Now, we're gonna need you
to get this train moving.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.638

It's not hot enough yet.

he's ready to murder someone.

ever since--

Davis: Now, these Californians...

39:32.280 --> 39:34.590
they're on the wrong side of history.

39:34.720 --> 39:38.270
They're trying to rip apart
the very thing that makes us strong.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.234
Two minutes.

40:18.640 --> 40:19.994
(GASPS)

40:22.880 --> 40:24.598
Oh, my God.

(DOOR OPENS)

40:30.800 --> 40:32.279
I wish you hadn't seen this.

40:34.280 --> 40:35.873
You son of a bitch.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.997
You're gonna kill everybody.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.149
Not everybody.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.670
I really meant
what I said tonight.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.110
I do love you.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.078
With all my heart.

41:21.080 --> 41:24.072
Davis: Because it signified
a bright future.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.356

And we say it with one voice.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.950
-(APPLAUSE)
- So tonight,

41:51.080 --> 41:53.799
let us all remember to say
God bless our heroes,

41:53.920 --> 41:56.799
the Republic of Texas,

41:56.920 --> 41:59.036
and God bless
the United States of America.
