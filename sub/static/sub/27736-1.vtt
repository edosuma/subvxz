02:45.644 --> 02:48.578
Oh. Oh, now... now I need to
brush up on my time-management skills.

02:48.580 --> 02:51.047
- You have a problem!
- Thank you for that. A problem?

02:51.049 --> 02:54.884
- Yeah, you're a hoarder!
- A problem? I don't think being a hoarder is the problem.

02:54.886 --> 02:57.720
Yeah, like, look at this.
Okay? A taxi receipt from 2010.

02:57.722 --> 02:59.756
You never know
when you might need it.

02:59.758 --> 03:02.892
I can tell you this right now:
You will not need this.

03:02.894 --> 03:05.895
This is my paperwork. Please put it down.
We'll deal with this later.

03:05.897 --> 03:08.498
And "my paperwork." Like a
taxi receipt is now paperwork?

03:08.500 --> 03:11.234
Oh, so calling it paperwork
is a problem for you now?

03:11.236 --> 03:14.404
Can you please stop saying
the word paperwork? God!

03:14.406 --> 03:16.406
God-fucking-dammit!

03:16.408 --> 03:18.274
I just had this shirt
dry-cleaned.

03:18.276 --> 03:19.912
I'm sorry, man.

03:20.579 --> 03:25.082
Um, I'm sorry, honey, you...
you had your shirt dry-cleaned?

03:25.084 --> 03:27.418
Yeah. Yeah, dry-cleaned.
I took it to whatever that place

03:27.420 --> 03:30.423
is called that you always go to
and asked them to dry-clean it.

03:32.024 --> 03:33.626
If you'll excuse me...

03:39.032 --> 03:41.200
I got a lot riding on this.

03:55.048 --> 03:56.748
Simon, give me your shirt.

03:56.750 --> 03:59.050
- What?
- Your shirt. Let's go.

03:59.052 --> 04:00.552
No.

04:00.554 --> 04:02.420
Come on.

04:02.422 --> 04:03.888
Get off of me!

04:03.890 --> 04:06.825
Jesus Christ!
What's gotten into you, man?

04:06.827 --> 04:08.960
Help me, dude, come on.

04:08.962 --> 04:10.965
Okay, okay, lay off. Jesus.

04:17.471 --> 04:19.807
I'm not gonna even ask, man.

04:25.345 --> 04:28.916
Come on. Let's go. Come on.
Come on, come on.

04:41.163 --> 04:43.198
Do I look okay?

05:27.977 --> 05:29.712
- What?
- Yo, chill! Come on.

05:31.413 --> 05:34.549
Hey, don't worry, man. I didn't
tell her anything about the crabs.

05:34.551 --> 05:37.752
- Sit down and shut up.
- Alright. - Back off, little dude.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.521
This is a
conversation between men.

05:40.523 --> 05:42.325
Glad you could take it there.

05:56.073 --> 05:58.506
Do you need a hand with that?

05:58.508 --> 06:01.609
- What?
- You're so lame.

06:01.611 --> 06:05.082
Alright, kids, let's bring it in!

06:22.900 --> 06:25.567
Hey, are... are you okay?
Do you need some help?

06:25.569 --> 06:27.471
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

06:29.707 --> 06:32.742
Um, you're Howie, right?
Simon's brother?

06:32.744 --> 06:34.878
Hmm. Yeah.
Don't hold it against me.

06:36.380 --> 06:38.915
Uh, Simon and I
are in French class together.

06:38.917 --> 06:41.751
Yeah, he's sort of a buffoon.

06:41.753 --> 06:43.989
No, he's not.

06:45.624 --> 06:47.993
You know, you guys
kind of have the same eyes.

06:49.728 --> 06:51.997
Both deep-set.

06:54.133 --> 06:55.565
Bless you.

06:55.567 --> 06:57.469
Thanks.

07:00.072 --> 07:02.572
Uh, I-I'm Lindsay.

07:02.574 --> 07:04.977
By the way.

07:05.811 --> 07:07.443
What are you in for?

07:07.445 --> 07:08.781
Asthma.

07:09.949 --> 07:11.348
Broken arm.

07:11.350 --> 07:13.418
Yeah, I can see.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.694
No, no, wait. Go back.

07:23.696 --> 07:26.432
- To what?
- The spelling bee.

07:31.204 --> 07:32.838
Do you guys know
that girl Lindsay?

07:35.042 --> 07:37.776
Simon, I think
she's in your French class?

07:37.778 --> 07:40.477
- So?
- So is she?

07:40.479 --> 07:42.781
Maybe.

07:42.783 --> 07:45.984
It's not a tough question.
She is or she isn't.

07:45.986 --> 07:48.820
Does she have, like, dark hair?
A birthmark right here?

07:48.822 --> 07:51.690
- Yeah, I think so.
- Fucking Tigo.

07:51.692 --> 07:53.692
Yeah, Tigo was her nickname,
right?

07:53.694 --> 07:56.194
Bruce Stagno fucked her when
she was a freshman or something

07:56.196 --> 07:59.198
and said she had this, like,
flesh-eating disease all over her body.

07:59.200 --> 08:03.135
- Impetigo.
- That's the most moronic thing I've ever heard.

08:03.137 --> 08:05.304
Well,
that's what Bruce Stagno said,

08:05.306 --> 08:08.209
and apparently it's really contagious,
so just keep your distance, bro.

08:09.210 --> 08:11.145
Fuck me. Look at her.

08:12.479 --> 08:16.382
She knows exactly what she's doing.
She's teasing us, man.

08:16.384 --> 08:18.019
<i>Occasion.</i>

08:19.821 --> 08:21.387
<i>Occasion.</i>

08:21.389 --> 08:24.190
<i>O-C-C-A...</i>

08:24.192 --> 08:27.762
<i>S-I-O-N.</i>

08:36.504 --> 08:38.740
Hey.

08:44.847 --> 08:46.847
- Hello?
- <i>Hi. Uh...</i>

08:46.849 --> 08:49.116
<i>can you tell the boys
that I don't think</i>

08:49.118 --> 08:52.921
<i>I'm gonna make it in time for dinner again?
I just... I got a little...</i>

08:54.623 --> 08:57.526
- Was that Dad?
- It's a wrong number.

09:01.364 --> 09:02.631
Okay.

09:07.437 --> 09:09.938
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

09:28.291 --> 09:30.960
Scoot over.

09:40.970 --> 09:43.673
I just need you to fuckin' move!

09:56.120 --> 09:58.022
<i>Come on,
I want to show you something.</i>

09:59.590 --> 10:01.990
Look.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.293
What?

10:04.295 --> 10:06.597
Dad slept on the couch again
last night.

10:10.668 --> 10:12.603
I just thought
you'd want to know.

10:15.706 --> 10:19.010
You know, we could've met
in a coffee shop.

10:20.811 --> 10:23.148
I can think clearer here.

10:24.316 --> 10:27.686
And what is it that you need
to think so clearly about?

10:29.721 --> 10:33.022
About our current
sleeping arrangements?

10:33.024 --> 10:35.459
I've never slept better.

10:35.461 --> 10:39.530
Yeah, well, the thing is, I
can't look to the right anymore.

10:39.532 --> 10:42.165
- You're not missing anything.
- C'mon, I'm serious.

10:42.167 --> 10:43.536
So am I.

10:48.541 --> 10:50.543
I really don't know
what to tell you.

10:55.747 --> 10:58.549
I was walking to work the other
day and I saw this couple.

10:58.551 --> 11:00.985
They couldn't have been
more than 25.

11:00.987 --> 11:03.189
And they were going at it.

11:05.191 --> 11:07.992
Hands everywhere,
tongues everywhere...

11:07.994 --> 11:12.165
That frenetic... energetic love?

11:14.401 --> 11:16.603
And I saw us in them.

11:21.208 --> 11:22.775
The good part of us.

11:27.414 --> 11:30.415
You know, I'm really not
prepared to talk about this

11:30.417 --> 11:32.786
in a barber shop
if I'm being honest.

11:44.031 --> 11:45.433
Bye.

12:01.549 --> 12:02.716
Simon!

12:03.284 --> 12:06.054
How many times do I have
to tell you to stop doing that?

12:18.467 --> 12:21.067
So you excited
to get your cast off?

12:21.069 --> 12:22.638
I guess.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.642
You want to go out and get
some ice cream after?

12:28.644 --> 12:30.446
What am I, like, seven?

12:31.480 --> 12:33.614
No. It's just that's what
we always did.

12:33.616 --> 12:35.482
You know,
we went to the doctor,

12:35.484 --> 12:38.185
and then we went
to go get ice cream after.

12:38.187 --> 12:40.656
Well, I don't need ice cream,
okay?

12:48.864 --> 12:51.466
Relationships are complicated.

12:51.468 --> 12:52.669
Okay?

12:57.507 --> 13:00.675
Look, I know that your brother
thinks it's something that I did.

13:00.677 --> 13:03.012
It's not, you know?

13:05.682 --> 13:07.882
Hello?

13:07.884 --> 13:11.688
Okay, Mom. I'd like to just focus on
my arm for right now, if that's okay?

13:32.410 --> 13:36.145
- Howie Sheffield!
- Dr. Rogers. Good to see you.

13:36.147 --> 13:38.749
- Ready to get this thing off?
- Yep.

13:39.216 --> 13:43.052
- It was sort of a chick magnet, though, wasn't it?
- Uh, I guess.

13:43.054 --> 13:45.154
I can keep it on if you like.

13:45.156 --> 13:47.825
Mm, no, that's okay,
Dr. Rogers.

13:59.571 --> 14:02.840
- Way to go. Yes.
- Thanks.

14:04.209 --> 14:06.509
I'm so proud of you!

14:06.511 --> 14:08.578
Everything okay?

14:08.580 --> 14:11.748
- Oh, he was a real champ. Yeah.
- That's my boy. - Feels great.

14:11.750 --> 14:15.287
Yeah, the kid tells me that you may
have some availability in your schedule.

14:16.521 --> 14:18.590
That's my direct line.

14:20.392 --> 14:22.194
Thanks, Dr. Rogers.

14:24.396 --> 14:26.098
- Here, I got it.
- Kevin?

14:28.601 --> 14:29.966
- Thanks.
- How you doing?

14:29.968 --> 14:31.602
- Good.
- Good.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.540
- Availability? What the fuck?
- I dunno.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.217
I'm sorry I said that.

16:06.334 --> 16:08.669
Come on!

16:10.338 --> 16:12.641
Hey, that means you too, guys.
Come on, bring it in.

16:17.646 --> 16:19.248
Alright. Now.

16:29.358 --> 16:31.391
Hey, where's your cast?

16:31.393 --> 16:33.694
I... got it off.

16:33.696 --> 16:35.897
So what are you still doing
here?

16:35.899 --> 16:40.735
- What do you mean?
- I mean how are you still excused from gym?

16:40.737 --> 16:44.672
Uh, well, uh, they don't know
that I got it off, so...

16:44.674 --> 16:47.040
You don't think
they'll maybe find out?

16:47.042 --> 16:50.210
- Are you gonna tell them?
- Um, no.

16:50.212 --> 16:52.916
Well, I think we're good, then.

17:14.771 --> 17:16.773
What's with you anyway?

17:18.040 --> 17:19.474
What's with me? Nothing.

17:19.477 --> 17:21.977
I'm not trying to pry
or anything.

17:21.979 --> 17:23.444
- I'm fine.
- Fine.

17:23.446 --> 17:24.915
Fine.

17:27.718 --> 17:29.453
- You know, you don't...
- I'm fine.

17:40.966 --> 17:43.601
Sometimes I feel like
I've been eaten by a shark.

17:45.303 --> 17:47.071
Swallowed whole.

17:49.407 --> 17:51.641
But I'm not dead,
I'm just, like...

17:51.643 --> 17:53.343
living in the shark,

17:53.345 --> 17:55.179
in its belly.

17:58.483 --> 18:01.920
And even though they keep
trying, no one will ever find me.

18:06.625 --> 18:10.529
If you want, I... could
bring you a sandwich tomorrow.

18:11.630 --> 18:12.999
I don't mind.

18:14.199 --> 18:16.335
Uh, yeah, okay. Sure.

18:30.650 --> 18:32.717
How old do you think she is?

18:32.719 --> 18:34.552
I dunno. Probably, like, 80.

18:34.554 --> 18:37.021
No, no,
the woman from the bus.

18:37.023 --> 18:39.156
You guys should see him
in the morning.

18:39.158 --> 18:40.793
He spends hours
in front of the mirror.

18:42.863 --> 18:45.365
No, she... she's just, like,
such a woman, you know?

18:47.034 --> 18:50.902
You can just tell she does,
like, womanly things,

18:50.904 --> 18:54.008
like... gets manicures
and eats petit fours.

19:01.048 --> 19:03.884
You ever heard about that kid that
got caught fucking a cantaloupe?

19:09.723 --> 19:11.323
That's bullshit.

19:11.325 --> 19:13.727
Oh, come on, like you
haven't thought about it.

19:47.029 --> 19:48.594
Come on.

19:48.596 --> 19:51.100
- I'm good.
- We're here, though.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.936
Suit yourself.

20:55.599 --> 20:57.168
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

20:57.801 --> 20:59.170
I'm sorry.

21:32.204 --> 21:34.405
Um, one.

21:37.976 --> 21:39.645
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

22:18.885 --> 22:20.253
Yeah?

22:22.021 --> 22:24.891
Sorry, Ma. I know that's no way
to answer the phone.

22:27.093 --> 22:28.695
No, I missed the bus.

22:30.264 --> 22:31.464
Uh-huh.

22:33.267 --> 22:36.469
Yes, I know that's
no reason to not go at all.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.773
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I was just...

22:40.774 --> 22:43.610
I've got a lot of stuff
on my mind right now.

22:45.478 --> 22:50.048
Yes, yes, okay, I'll make sure not
getting expelled is one of them! Yes!

22:53.921 --> 22:56.291
Fuuuuuck...!!!

23:18.313 --> 23:19.948
Ah, fuck.

23:26.821 --> 23:29.290
What the fuck are you doing?

23:29.292 --> 23:31.958
Um... flying a kite?

23:31.960 --> 23:33.528
Why?

23:35.530 --> 23:37.532
Not sure.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.536
- It doesn't seem like you're very good at it.
- Nope.

23:43.538 --> 23:46.142
No, it doesn't.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.618
Dad's definitely cheating
on Mom.

23:58.287 --> 23:59.853
How do you know?

23:59.855 --> 24:02.124
I saw him
with Felicity Kavanagh.

24:03.793 --> 24:05.362
Jesus.

24:11.701 --> 24:15.403
<i>It wasn't always this way. There were good times.</i>

24:15.405 --> 24:17.172
Great ones, even.

24:17.174 --> 24:20.474
Times when just the thought
of her would make me smile.

24:20.476 --> 24:23.812
I'd be on the subway and...

24:23.814 --> 24:27.015
I would feel myself just...

24:27.017 --> 24:30.387
grinning this stupid grin
and I'd think...

24:32.589 --> 24:36.024
This is love, this is love.
This is... this is it.

24:36.026 --> 24:38.595
A stupid smile
when you're alone.

24:42.599 --> 24:45.836
And then somehow, over time,
I stopped smiling.

24:57.514 --> 24:59.248
I'd try to.

24:59.250 --> 25:02.184
I'd try to get back
to that place.

25:02.186 --> 25:06.390
And I realized you better hold onto
those times when you're smiling,

25:06.392 --> 25:09.193
because when you stop,
that's when it starts.

26:16.497 --> 26:18.131
Fuck.

27:32.208 --> 27:34.908
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

27:34.910 --> 27:36.911
Talking points?
Marina Abramovic?

27:36.913 --> 27:40.014
Are you trying to win this woman
over with Marina Abromovic?

27:40.016 --> 27:42.216
Yeah, do you even know
who she is?

27:42.218 --> 27:45.221
Well, you're not the only one
who can read a subway poster.

27:46.222 --> 27:49.423
You'd be better off discussing
the health benefits of Trimino.

27:49.425 --> 27:50.793
Come on.

28:21.626 --> 28:24.259
I threw up before I grew up,

28:24.261 --> 28:26.795
and always wondered
why I was stood up.

28:26.797 --> 28:30.932
In the kitchen just wishing he
would pick me up, raise me up,

28:30.934 --> 28:34.270
my makeup fading, degrading,
turning into hating.

28:34.272 --> 28:36.073
If I cry, I'll just die.

28:37.075 --> 28:40.476
So I suck it up
as my stomach knots up,

28:40.478 --> 28:41.978
and I hold my breath

28:41.980 --> 28:44.182
till this bullshit rests.

28:54.693 --> 28:57.260
<i>Knees up,
lower down. Knees up.</i>

28:57.262 --> 28:58.662
<i>Good.</i>

28:58.664 --> 29:00.329
<i>Lift.</i>

29:00.331 --> 29:02.332
<i>Not only is this exercise
good for your glutes,</i>

29:02.334 --> 29:04.501
<i>it's also really good
for your shoulders,</i>

29:04.503 --> 29:06.503
<i>strength and stability.</i>

29:06.505 --> 29:07.937
<i>Two more.</i>

29:12.511 --> 29:16.880
<i>Lower down. Knees up.
Lower down. Knees up. Good.</i>

29:33.165 --> 29:35.466
Ah, c'mon,
you know who I'm talking about.

29:35.468 --> 29:38.135
Sweetie, I'm gonna have
to ask you to sit down.

29:38.137 --> 29:39.970
The beautiful one
who always sits over there?

29:39.972 --> 29:42.540
Honey, I'm gonna have to insist.
This thing stops short?

29:42.542 --> 29:45.143
You got a date
with the windshield.

30:09.603 --> 30:11.505
Howie, is that you?

30:19.380 --> 30:22.514
Hey, I'm thinking about going
back to the store part-time.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.218
Hattie called me today.

30:33.260 --> 30:37.096
"Wow, that's so great, Mom.
I'm so happy for you.

30:37.098 --> 30:40.435
Seriously,
I know how much you missed it."

31:14.903 --> 31:17.338
Hey, dude, remember that movie
we saw with Joaquin Phoenix

31:17.340 --> 31:19.807
and, like, the shit being
smeared all over the walls?

31:19.809 --> 31:22.108
What the hell are you talking about?

31:22.110 --> 31:24.978
Y'know, like, that beautiful
young girl with the rosy cheeks

31:24.980 --> 31:27.014
gets kidnapped and sodomized
by Michael Caine.

31:27.016 --> 31:28.516
What, Quills?
No, she wasn't sodomized.

31:28.518 --> 31:30.284
There was definitely
some rape going on.

31:30.286 --> 31:31.919
Remember she used
to take Marquis's books

31:31.921 --> 31:33.789
and glue the pages
into another book

31:33.791 --> 31:35.990
so Michael Caine
wouldn't find out?

31:35.992 --> 31:39.661
And then she'd read them in bed
with the dude she was in love with.

31:39.663 --> 31:40.831
So?

31:43.667 --> 31:45.168
So nothing.

31:47.671 --> 31:49.939
I gotta find her.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.341
Who?

31:53.343 --> 31:55.044
The woman from the bus.

32:00.684 --> 32:02.951
Hey, wait.
That's my toothbrush, dude.

32:02.953 --> 32:05.487
Ah, shit. Sorry, dude.

32:18.870 --> 32:21.370
I'm starving.
Can you ask someone for bread?

32:21.372 --> 32:23.506
Who?

32:23.508 --> 32:26.076
I don't know,
someone who has access to it?

32:27.879 --> 32:31.714
Excuse me. Sir? Hi.
Could we please get some bread?

32:31.716 --> 32:33.218
Thank you.

32:35.987 --> 32:37.720
I was handling it.

32:37.722 --> 32:40.225
It's just bread. It's fine.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.862
You say it's bread,
but it's not bread.

32:44.864 --> 32:46.864
Can't it just be bread?

32:46.866 --> 32:50.101
Just this once,
could it just be bread?

32:54.673 --> 32:56.406
That's not...

32:56.408 --> 32:58.911
I knew this would happen.

33:01.012 --> 33:02.548
I wasn't...

33:10.924 --> 33:12.558
I hate this place.

33:29.809 --> 33:31.943
- What did you really expect tonight?
- I know.

33:31.945 --> 33:35.146
- That we'd just go out to dinner and...
- No, I mean, I...

33:35.148 --> 33:38.585
I didn't necessarily think
things would just be wrapped up.

34:04.745 --> 34:06.745
What's going on?

34:06.747 --> 34:08.647
We're fixing the engine
on the car.

34:08.649 --> 34:10.649
What does it look like?

34:10.650 --> 34:13.752
They say that when you're
going through a rough time,

34:13.754 --> 34:16.257
you should busy yourself
with a new project.

34:19.193 --> 34:21.027
So where is Dad?

34:21.029 --> 34:22.797
I don't know.

34:23.531 --> 34:25.665
Is he coming home?

34:25.667 --> 34:27.435
I don't know.

34:30.839 --> 34:32.206
So that's it?

34:33.775 --> 34:35.010
Maybe.

34:37.946 --> 34:39.679
Uh, can I help you, or...

34:39.681 --> 34:42.851
Yes, dear. You can knit me
a fucking sweater.

35:16.486 --> 35:18.386
Here! Take a good look!

35:18.388 --> 35:20.187
What are you doing?!

35:20.189 --> 35:22.690
I know what you've been looking for.
I'm not stupid.

35:22.692 --> 35:24.225
Please!

35:24.227 --> 35:26.727
Bruce Stagno
is a fucking liar, okay?

35:26.729 --> 35:28.329
Okay.

35:28.331 --> 35:30.000
Okay.

35:44.581 --> 35:46.848
Alright, man,
let's just get our card and go.

35:46.850 --> 35:50.085
We can't just do that, alright?
We gotta get her a cake, too.

35:50.087 --> 35:52.090
- Cake? Really?
- Yeah.

35:53.924 --> 35:55.626
Okay.

35:56.860 --> 35:59.097
If there is a hell,
this is it.

36:03.434 --> 36:06.969
- "Mother, you've been there since the beginning and...
- No, no.

36:06.971 --> 36:09.539
I didn't even finish.

36:15.613 --> 36:17.115
Uh...

36:18.950 --> 36:20.450
Hey, how about this one?

36:20.452 --> 36:22.620
Whatever, just grab one.

36:23.555 --> 36:25.423
Oh, my God, it's her.

36:27.126 --> 36:28.560
Who?

36:30.762 --> 36:32.230
What do I do?

36:33.331 --> 36:35.467
Just go up to her, dude.

36:39.337 --> 36:41.572
Huh?

36:41.574 --> 36:44.340
Okay, look,
just get my back, okay?

36:44.342 --> 36:45.911
Okay, man.

36:52.585 --> 36:53.919
Shit.

36:55.354 --> 36:58.355
Oh. Uh, sorry.
No, it wasn't you.

36:58.357 --> 37:00.992
It was, um...
Great choice. Really.

37:00.994 --> 37:02.795
Dude, come on, let's go.

37:06.799 --> 37:08.833
<i>There's this kind of bird.
Um...</i>

37:08.835 --> 37:10.601
it's called a grebe.

37:10.603 --> 37:14.172
And, um,
specifically a Western grebe.

37:14.174 --> 37:16.808
And, uh, there's this...

37:16.810 --> 37:19.010
this mating ritual they have,

37:19.012 --> 37:23.515
where they... they kind
of sprint across the water,

37:23.517 --> 37:26.951
together, um, in groups of two.

37:26.953 --> 37:31.689
And, um...
their ability to stay together

37:31.691 --> 37:34.026
while they're going
across the water

37:34.028 --> 37:38.032
is actually what determines
the future of the relationship.

37:39.033 --> 37:41.533
It's like if one of the partners
can't keep stride,

37:41.535 --> 37:43.838
then they don't make the cut.

37:49.710 --> 37:54.215
I think there was a time...
when Tom and I were in sync.

37:55.216 --> 37:57.416
You know, when we were...

37:57.418 --> 38:00.653
running in the same direction...

38:00.655 --> 38:02.323
at the same time.

38:03.658 --> 38:05.059
But...

38:06.427 --> 38:09.864
...I don't really remember now.

38:15.237 --> 38:19.239
Sometimes I think
that if we were... grebes,

38:19.241 --> 38:20.876
then...

38:22.443 --> 38:25.881
...there's no way in a million
years we would've have partnered up.

39:31.949 --> 39:34.316
Simon, why are you looking at me
like that?

39:34.318 --> 39:36.352
- I wasn't looking at you.
- Yes, you were.

39:36.354 --> 39:38.954
You were very much looking at me
in a way.

39:38.956 --> 39:41.326
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be.

39:47.332 --> 39:49.265
- See, that's what we need.
- Hmm.

39:49.267 --> 39:50.766
- What?
- More pictures.

39:50.768 --> 39:53.338
We don't have any pictures
of us as a family.

39:54.172 --> 39:56.873
Excuse me. Excuse me, miss?

39:56.875 --> 40:00.643
Hi. Would you mind
taking a picture of us?

40:00.645 --> 40:02.612
- No, Mom, come on. That's insane.
- It's fine.

40:02.614 --> 40:04.280
Do you mind?
You just press that...

40:04.282 --> 40:05.982
Dude,
it's the girl from the bus.

40:05.984 --> 40:08.351
Okay, come on, come on.
Get over here.

40:08.353 --> 40:10.354
- Okay. - Okay.
- Make it good, boys.

40:10.356 --> 40:13.056
Yeah, Mom,
let's not do too many, though,

40:13.058 --> 40:16.025
because people don't like it
when you interrupt their day.

40:16.027 --> 40:17.560
- It's fine. She's fine.
- Ahem.

40:17.562 --> 40:20.366
Look up. Okay.

40:23.069 --> 40:27.505
One thing. I just want to... like,
just straighten that out a little bit.

40:29.141 --> 40:31.811
- Thank you. - Yeah.
- Look in the camera, Simon.

40:34.914 --> 40:37.881
- Is that good?
- Yeah, I think we got it. I think.

40:37.883 --> 40:39.316
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

40:39.318 --> 40:42.221
Okay, let's see what we got.

40:43.222 --> 40:44.888
Oh, that's good.

40:44.890 --> 40:46.590
Ugh, I look terrible.

40:46.592 --> 40:50.096
You look nice, Simon. What's that?
Oh, you took a video.

40:51.331 --> 40:53.733
Oh, look at that.
We look so good.

40:54.734 --> 40:56.902
That's cute.
Look how cute we are.

40:59.039 --> 41:01.274
Oh. Okay.

41:03.443 --> 41:06.911
- Thank you.
- Sure. No problem. It was my pleasure.

41:06.913 --> 41:08.615
Nice to see you again.

41:09.616 --> 41:13.718
- You two know each other?
- No. I-I... We don't. We don't know each other.

41:13.720 --> 41:16.422
We took... we take
the bus together sometimes.

41:16.424 --> 41:18.857
- Oh. Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.

41:18.859 --> 41:20.525
- Well, I'm Carla.
- Hi.

41:20.527 --> 41:23.028
And, uh, this is Simon
and Howie.

41:23.030 --> 41:25.732
But I guess
you already know that.

41:26.867 --> 41:28.968
I'm Odessa.

41:28.970 --> 41:30.938
Odessa.

41:32.539 --> 41:34.440
- Sorry?
- No, uh, beautiful?

41:34.442 --> 41:36.275
I just said your name
was beautiful.

41:36.277 --> 41:39.078
- Eh, it's alright.
- Well, thanks, Odessa,

41:39.080 --> 41:41.783
for the pictures. And videos.

41:43.618 --> 41:45.918
See you around sometime.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.489
Where?

41:48.457 --> 41:50.091
The bus.

41:52.261 --> 41:54.660
I work at the, uh,
farmer's market.

41:54.662 --> 41:56.796
I sell vegetables there.

41:56.798 --> 42:01.170
It's the stand right next to the
one that sells all that wool?

42:02.471 --> 42:04.306
I-I love wool.

42:19.922 --> 42:22.689
<i>She'd never know.
Like the snow,</i>

42:22.691 --> 42:25.794
she left him cold, frozen...

42:39.608 --> 42:43.277
She'd never know.
Like the snow,

42:43.279 --> 42:45.780
she left him cold, frozen...

42:45.782 --> 42:48.017
Speak up!

42:54.558 --> 42:56.624
She'd never know.

42:56.626 --> 43:00.728
Like the snow,
she left him cold, frozen,

43:00.730 --> 43:02.964
unable to speak, weep.

43:02.966 --> 43:05.032
No sleep for weeks.

43:05.034 --> 43:07.735
She was his... for a time.

43:07.737 --> 43:09.538
Naked. Sublime.

43:09.540 --> 43:12.543
His eyes breathing her in...
like sin.

43:13.477 --> 43:14.979
Unravelling.

43:17.748 --> 43:20.417
Uh, that's... all I got so far.

43:23.187 --> 43:25.555
Uh... anyone?

43:25.557 --> 43:27.389
Um, I dunno.

43:27.391 --> 43:29.258
"His eyes breathing her in"?

43:29.260 --> 43:31.059
Mm, you're right.

43:31.061 --> 43:34.763
I mean, I was into it. I was.
But that sorta stuck out to me.

43:34.765 --> 43:38.268
It felt a little false. I mean,
just to the rest of the stuff.

43:38.270 --> 43:41.104
Because I really liked
the rest of the stuff.

43:41.106 --> 43:43.774
- Does it have a title?
- Uh...

43:45.577 --> 43:48.013
An Ode to Odessa.

43:51.416 --> 43:52.584
Yeah.

44:00.225 --> 44:02.091
Howie?

44:02.093 --> 44:03.693
Oh, hey.

44:03.695 --> 44:06.031
Hey, come sit with us.
This is Eduardo.

44:07.799 --> 44:09.732
Uh, hey, what's up, Eddy?

44:09.734 --> 44:11.968
- It's Eduardo.
- C'mon.

44:11.970 --> 44:14.238
Uh... no, no, that's okay.
Really.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.241
I'm... not feeling
that side of the room.

44:17.243 --> 44:19.612
But it was really good
to see you.

44:24.951 --> 44:27.952
Hey, so, uh, Eduardo,

44:27.954 --> 44:31.088
what happened there?
Skiing accident?

44:31.090 --> 44:33.125
At least I have an injury,
bro.

44:36.262 --> 44:37.730
Howie, wait.

44:41.968 --> 44:45.439
Hey, um, I'm sorry about him.

44:46.573 --> 44:48.976
And I'm also really sorry
about the other day.

44:51.278 --> 44:55.113
That idiot gave me that nickname
and it took a while to shake.

44:55.115 --> 44:58.750
- No, you don't have to.
- Kinda like when you're fat...

44:58.752 --> 45:00.085
Even if you lose
all this weight,

45:00.087 --> 45:02.122
you still kinda think
you're fat?

45:03.757 --> 45:07.995
I sometimes feel like that's all
people see when they look at me.

45:09.763 --> 45:13.100
It's fine. You don't have
to explain anything to me.

45:14.101 --> 45:17.104
Uh, I... just thought
I owed you something.

45:18.038 --> 45:21.109
No, uh, really, you don't.

45:37.892 --> 45:39.360
Howie.

45:40.696 --> 45:43.532
- Hey.
- Come sit.

45:46.502 --> 45:48.537
- Fancy seeing you here.
- Yeah.

45:52.708 --> 45:54.675
Oh, sorry. Your locket.

45:54.677 --> 45:57.810
Uh, I noticed it before.
It's beautiful.

45:57.812 --> 46:01.581
Thanks. It was, uh,
it was my grandmother's.

46:01.583 --> 46:03.583
I nearly didn't get it,
actually.

46:03.585 --> 46:07.821
Um, my uncle was reading her will
off a Post-It note and, uh...

46:07.823 --> 46:12.660
it was bequeathed to me? I don't what
the word is, but... Is it "bequeathed"?

46:12.662 --> 46:15.195
Uh, well, if your grandmother
was Queen Elizabeth.

46:15.197 --> 46:17.732
Right. Well, the point is,

46:17.734 --> 46:20.867
- I... I nearly didn't get it.
- Oh.

46:20.869 --> 46:23.837
- So...
- My grandmother once gave me a needlepoint pillow.

46:23.839 --> 46:27.175
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that said "I never finish anyth..."

46:27.177 --> 46:30.378
- Any what?
- No, that's the joke. Right?

46:30.380 --> 46:31.746
"Anyth..."

46:31.748 --> 46:33.548
No, like "anything"
isn't finished,

46:33.550 --> 46:35.083
'cause she never finishes
anything?

46:35.085 --> 46:37.585
Right, right, right.
Okay, yes, yes, I get it.

46:37.587 --> 46:39.620
I just like
hearing you talk about it.

46:39.622 --> 46:42.056
No, no, it's great stuff. It really is.
It's classic pillow.

46:42.058 --> 46:44.859
I like hearing you explain the
most obvious joke in the world.

46:44.861 --> 46:46.861
Sounds like a funny grandma.

46:46.863 --> 46:49.197
Yeah, she's a...
she's a firecracker.

46:49.199 --> 46:51.702
Mm.

46:52.770 --> 46:54.204
Um...

46:55.606 --> 46:57.406
Oh, this is my stop!

46:57.408 --> 47:01.212
- Oh.
- Okay, um... it was nice to see you, Howie.

47:31.410 --> 47:34.246
- Ah!
- Fuck.

47:36.248 --> 47:39.282
- Is your mother home?
- No, she went to Whole Foods.

47:39.284 --> 47:42.020
I came to pick up
some of my stuff.

47:43.823 --> 47:45.825
- That's never good.
- Yeah.

47:49.161 --> 47:51.831
You know,
you kinda look like crap, Dad.

47:52.832 --> 47:54.998
Well...

47:55.000 --> 47:57.835
I'm sorry that I don't meet your
high standards of appearance, son.

47:57.837 --> 47:59.839
Sorry.

48:02.941 --> 48:06.544
I've been a good dad, right?
I went to T-ball games and...

48:06.546 --> 48:08.779
I went to school plays, right?

48:08.781 --> 48:13.553
I mean, I don't think we were in
any school plays, but... I guess so.

48:17.190 --> 48:18.859
I love you, kids.

48:20.293 --> 48:22.295
And I love your mother.

48:30.069 --> 48:32.871
- Oh, hello.
- Let me... let me help you with those.

48:32.873 --> 48:35.707
It's okay. No, I got it.

48:35.709 --> 48:38.812
Jesus. They're just groceries!
C'mon.

48:46.720 --> 48:49.254
Uh, we were gonna go
to Reggie's.

48:49.256 --> 48:51.824
You know, if you wanted to come.

48:51.826 --> 48:53.695
- Oh, it's okay, honey...
- Okay.

48:55.028 --> 48:57.095
I love Reggie's.

48:57.097 --> 48:58.900
Just picking up some stuff.

49:06.006 --> 49:08.073
- You didn't even touch them.
- Look at me.

49:08.075 --> 49:11.009
Do I look like someone who'd be
interested in lifting weights?

49:11.011 --> 49:13.679
- Well, I just thought...
- There's nothing wrong with some tone.

49:13.681 --> 49:17.350
And, well, we think it could help
with your focus and your self-esteem.

49:17.352 --> 49:20.088
- We?
- So you guys are, like, a team now?

49:22.690 --> 49:24.925
Well, fine.
Just give them to Simon.

49:24.927 --> 49:27.728
- Maybe he wants them.
- I don't want 'em.

49:27.730 --> 49:30.463
It wouldn't hurt, you know,
for either of you to buff up.

49:30.465 --> 49:32.566
Eh, it could, actually,
if done incorrectly.

49:32.568 --> 49:35.569
Yeah, since when was being buff
valued in this family anyway?

49:35.571 --> 49:38.206
And I use the term "family"
really loosely.

49:44.446 --> 49:46.213
Boys...

49:46.215 --> 49:48.448
I knew it! You're fucking
Felicity Kavanagh!

49:48.450 --> 49:50.985
- Simon Sheffield!
- What are you talking about?

49:50.987 --> 49:55.088
Felicity Kavanagh. I saw you. Sitting
on the same side of the table.

49:55.090 --> 49:57.624
- Let me explain.
- Okay, boys, boys, that's enough.

49:57.626 --> 49:59.761
Ahem.

49:59.763 --> 50:02.897
Your father and I obviously have
some issues that we need to sort out,

50:02.899 --> 50:05.635
and we are taking
the necessary steps...

50:07.504 --> 50:10.072
Screw it.
He's fucking Felicity Kavanagh.

51:45.203 --> 51:47.004
- Hey.
- Hi.

51:47.006 --> 51:48.041
Hey.

51:50.743 --> 51:52.076
You know,
this is a fucking scam.

51:52.078 --> 51:53.544
You think it's gonna be
all cheap and shit

51:53.546 --> 51:55.846
'cause it costs
57 cents a pound,

51:55.848 --> 51:59.216
but what they don't tell you is that
peanut-butter cups are heavy as shit,

51:59.218 --> 52:03.055
so your fucking yogurt ends up
costing, like, $15.

52:03.057 --> 52:05.589
Has anyone ever told you
that you're a moron?

52:05.591 --> 52:08.894
- Has anyone ever told you you should blow me?
- Oh!

52:08.896 --> 52:10.528
In your fuckin' dreams, man!

52:10.530 --> 52:12.099
Look who it is.

52:13.299 --> 52:15.366
- Howie!!
- Shut up! Seriously.

52:15.368 --> 52:17.969
Yeah, what is with you?

52:17.971 --> 52:20.974
She's pissed 'cause Howie's
obsessed with some 30-year-old.

52:22.042 --> 52:23.775
Wait, what?

52:23.777 --> 52:25.310
Idiot.

52:25.312 --> 52:27.614
Nothing. Some woman.

52:28.649 --> 52:31.452
This is gross.
I'm... I'm outta here.

52:34.488 --> 52:36.555
Idiots.

52:36.557 --> 52:38.223
The both of you.

52:38.225 --> 52:39.727
- Yeah.
- What?

52:40.761 --> 52:42.964
What did we do?

52:51.673 --> 52:54.339
It hadn't all gone away.

52:54.341 --> 52:56.778
The beautiful nothingness
had stayed.

53:01.449 --> 53:03.516
And the weight of it
made him choke

53:03.518 --> 53:06.155
as her eyes continued
to make their way through him.

54:01.578 --> 54:04.648
- How much for this? - Two dollars.
- Uh, they're not for sale.

54:21.665 --> 54:24.934
- I'll give you five bucks for these three.
- We told you.

54:24.936 --> 54:26.735
My mom's going through
something, guy.

54:26.737 --> 54:28.873
We're not really selling
anything right now.

54:45.590 --> 54:47.190
Go.

54:47.192 --> 54:49.094
- Oh, it's my turn?
- Yeah.

54:55.033 --> 54:58.036
Hearts.

55:02.774 --> 55:04.710
- Mom, that's you.
- Oh.

55:05.711 --> 55:07.378
Hearts...

55:47.354 --> 55:49.756
I think it's over here.
Come on.

55:53.327 --> 55:55.860
It's gonna be worth it.
It says here:

55:55.862 --> 55:59.298
"Cubes of silky tofu
become a steadfast calm

55:59.300 --> 56:02.669
in an otherwise wild mix
of garlic."

56:03.771 --> 56:06.038
Sounds like you and Mom.

56:06.040 --> 56:09.343
Wait. Am I the, uh, the tofu,
or the garlic?

56:11.178 --> 56:13.111
Scoot yourself through there.

56:13.113 --> 56:14.813
What? Why?

56:14.815 --> 56:18.617
Because...
I think it's the right way.

56:18.619 --> 56:22.189
So you think the way to this fancy
restaurant is through this fucking fence?

56:25.059 --> 56:26.560
Really?

56:31.199 --> 56:33.001
I'm really trying here.

56:34.802 --> 56:36.338
Okay?

56:41.009 --> 56:42.811
You should know that.

56:46.581 --> 56:48.881
C'mon.

56:48.883 --> 56:51.152
Yeah, whatever.

57:06.835 --> 57:08.670
I'm starving.

57:25.355 --> 57:27.621
Fuck you!!

57:27.623 --> 57:29.259
Fuck you!

57:33.430 --> 57:36.266
Uh... it is okay
if we just go home?

57:38.868 --> 57:42.439
I mean, Mom made a ton
of eggplant parm, so...

57:43.273 --> 57:44.808
...we can eat the leftovers.

57:46.642 --> 57:48.544
Yeah, it's my favourite.

58:20.244 --> 58:21.677
Hey, how was dinner?

58:21.679 --> 58:23.779
Uh, we hit some snags.

58:23.781 --> 58:27.484
Mom, you look really pretty
in this light.

58:27.486 --> 58:30.755
Ah, thank you, honey.
That's so sweet.

58:31.923 --> 58:34.792
Maybe it's the, uh,
incandescent lighting.

58:44.936 --> 58:48.006
- Oh, this looks great. Thanks.
- Sure.

58:51.609 --> 58:53.212
Hey, Simon.

58:55.647 --> 58:57.349
Uh, gimme a break.

59:01.153 --> 59:04.323
I just like a good bulb,
ya know?

59:05.324 --> 59:08.292
- Hmm.
- I think lighting as a whole

59:08.294 --> 59:10.863
should be taken
way more seriously.

59:14.534 --> 59:15.968
Mm.

59:50.004 --> 59:52.571
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

59:52.573 --> 59:55.176
Hi.

59:58.212 --> 01:00:01.715
- Want to smell something nice?
- Yeah. Yeah!

01:00:03.217 --> 01:00:04.716
Wow. Yeah.

01:00:04.718 --> 01:00:07.587
- You know what that is?
- Uh... no. What is it?

01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:10.055
- It's basil.
- Alright.

01:00:10.057 --> 01:00:12.191
Yeah, it's my favourite.

01:00:12.193 --> 01:00:14.527
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

01:00:14.529 --> 01:00:16.362
I, uh, I got you something.

01:00:16.364 --> 01:00:17.630
Uh...

01:00:17.632 --> 01:00:19.967
it's Paul Newman.

01:00:20.901 --> 01:00:23.369
- Yeah.
- But he's not Paul Newman yet.

01:00:23.371 --> 01:00:24.803
- Mm-hmm.
- He's just Paul Newman.

01:00:24.805 --> 01:00:26.807
You know,
like another face in the crowd.

01:00:28.243 --> 01:00:30.977
- Thanks.
- Yeah, I find it hopeful. - Yeah.

01:00:30.979 --> 01:00:33.915
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Hmm.

01:00:37.452 --> 01:00:40.153
So... this is...
this is your stuff, huh?

01:00:40.155 --> 01:00:42.456
Yeah.

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:44.324
- You grow all of it, huh?
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah.

01:00:44.326 --> 01:00:45.892
Yeah.

01:00:45.894 --> 01:00:47.430
Ahem.

01:00:50.666 --> 01:00:53.267
Actually, you know what?
I, uh...

01:00:53.269 --> 01:00:57.171
My mom's waiting for me
at, uh... the carwash.

01:00:57.173 --> 01:00:58.939
Okay. Yeah, no, go.

01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:02.912
- Alright, cool. Um, it's good to see you.
- To see you, too.

01:01:03.646 --> 01:01:06.847
See ya. Oh, you know what?
Let me, uh...

01:01:06.849 --> 01:01:09.083
give you something
from my garden.

01:01:09.085 --> 01:01:11.586
- Oh.
- That's for you.

01:01:11.588 --> 01:01:13.089
- Alright.
- Yeah.

01:01:16.593 --> 01:01:18.158
I mean...

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.794
- Excellent.
- It is? Okay. Good.

01:01:20.796 --> 01:01:24.499
Well, I...
I prefer them cooked, myself.

01:01:24.501 --> 01:01:26.501
Eh.

01:01:26.503 --> 01:01:28.936
Maybe I'll cook the rest.

01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:22.024
You know,
I once saw a shoe up there,

01:02:22.026 --> 01:02:24.360
hanging like the ones
on the telephone wires.

01:02:24.362 --> 01:02:27.165
I could never really figure out
how it got up there, though.

01:02:29.735 --> 01:02:31.170
Hi.

01:02:33.572 --> 01:02:36.175
I never slept
with Bruce Stagno.

01:02:38.944 --> 01:02:42.581
Him and my brother...
they used to be friends.

01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:48.755
He'd always be hanging around my
house and he'd give me these looks.

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:54.093
I guess I maybe liked
the attention, so...

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.796
...I'd flirt back.

01:02:57.963 --> 01:03:00.263
It was harmless, though.

01:03:00.265 --> 01:03:02.402
It was totally harmless.

01:03:06.206 --> 01:03:08.106
I remember I'd...

01:03:08.108 --> 01:03:12.612
I'd used to make him cookies
and... and brownies.

01:03:14.781 --> 01:03:17.984
I would just bake for him
if I knew he was coming over.

01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:22.989
And, um...

01:03:24.424 --> 01:03:26.558
...then one day, I...

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.628
I noticed that he started
spending more time with me

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:31.799
in the kitchen
than with my brother.

01:03:34.635 --> 01:03:37.304
And he was really popular,
you know?

01:03:44.145 --> 01:03:46.245
So, uh...

01:03:46.247 --> 01:03:48.582
one day,
we were in the basement.

01:03:50.819 --> 01:03:53.254
He started to give me a massage.

01:03:57.158 --> 01:03:58.827
I liked it.

01:04:00.027 --> 01:04:02.363
So... I let him do it.

01:04:04.999 --> 01:04:08.336
I remember he was snacking
on Goldfish and...

01:04:09.937 --> 01:04:13.842
...when he went in to kiss me,
there was still one in his mouth.

01:04:16.278 --> 01:04:19.181
I can't...
actually eat them anymore.

01:04:23.952 --> 01:04:25.687
Anyways, he, um...

01:04:28.691 --> 01:04:30.626
...he... he tried to go further.

01:04:35.698 --> 01:04:38.868
I pushed him off,
but he kept trying.

01:04:40.703 --> 01:04:43.704
I guess I was yelling
or something...

01:04:43.706 --> 01:04:45.308
'cause my brother...

01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:50.379
...came down and basically threw him
off of me and beat the shit out of him.

01:04:54.885 --> 01:04:56.652
Bruce was crazy...

01:04:58.889 --> 01:05:01.388
...calling me a tease and...

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:03.894
whatever he could think of.

01:05:09.232 --> 01:05:11.735
I think he was embarrassed,
really.

01:05:14.404 --> 01:05:17.039
This little nothing girl
turning him down.

01:05:22.513 --> 01:05:24.548
That's how it started.

01:05:26.416 --> 01:05:29.253
The next day at school,
he spread the rumour.

01:05:31.355 --> 01:05:35.693
Took a really...
really long time to shake it.

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:42.364
Him and my brother
never spoke again.

01:05:42.366 --> 01:05:44.767
So, um...

01:05:44.769 --> 01:05:47.037
Yeah, that...
that's what happened.

01:05:54.779 --> 01:05:56.581
You're not nothing.

01:05:59.584 --> 01:06:00.953
Thanks.

01:06:22.741 --> 01:06:25.141
Remember when we first met,
you would tell me

01:06:25.143 --> 01:06:28.614
about all the pottery classes you
took and all the books you'd read?

01:06:29.982 --> 01:06:33.452
I really did read all those books.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.422
Maybe I made up the bits
about the pottery.

01:06:38.424 --> 01:06:41.191
Yeah. No matter how many times I asked,

01:06:41.193 --> 01:06:43.861
nothing would ever materialize.

01:06:45.197 --> 01:06:47.466
It was always
still in the kiln.

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:53.504
I wanted you to think
that I was smart...

01:06:53.506 --> 01:06:55.105
and cultured.

01:06:55.107 --> 01:06:57.308
I did.

01:06:57.310 --> 01:06:59.212
You are.

01:07:01.781 --> 01:07:05.017
You know,
when it was just the two of us,

01:07:05.019 --> 01:07:07.652
before the kids,

01:07:07.654 --> 01:07:10.355
I used to go through my day
just...

01:07:10.357 --> 01:07:14.026
collecting little stories and...

01:07:14.028 --> 01:07:16.028
pieces of things that happened,

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:18.731
and I couldn't wait
to tell you about it.

01:07:21.902 --> 01:07:24.371
And then at some point, I...

01:07:25.973 --> 01:07:28.042
...it just didn't seem worth it.

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.383
I'm sorry, Carla,
for fucking this up for us.

01:07:43.691 --> 01:07:45.259
I'm sorry.

01:07:47.495 --> 01:07:50.164
I'm sorry
I stopped giving a shit.

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:39.447
Uh, need any help
with these?

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.950
Hi.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:46.554
Yes, I do. That would...
that would be great. Thank you.

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:49.323
- Mm-hmm.
- You can put this crap... - Okay.

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:53.130
- Grab... some of those and... and pop 'em in the back.
- Okay, yeah.

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:01.903
- I'll take this.
- Thanks. - Yeah.

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:16.252
The poem is really beautiful.
Who is it?

01:09:16.987 --> 01:09:18.354
Uh, me.

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:21.993
- You wrote that?
- Yeah.

01:09:32.937 --> 01:09:34.703
I like that colour.

01:09:34.706 --> 01:09:36.606
Oh.

01:09:36.608 --> 01:09:39.809
Yeah, it's stupid.
I thought it was fun.

01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:41.446
It's just, um...

01:09:42.947 --> 01:09:44.680
It's called Jade Dragon.

01:09:44.682 --> 01:09:45.982
Mm.

01:09:45.984 --> 01:09:48.451
Jade Dragon.

01:10:24.057 --> 01:10:26.925
It's all hidden by the snow
right now,

01:10:26.927 --> 01:10:29.861
but you should see it.
It's really amazing.

01:10:29.863 --> 01:10:31.428
It's already amazing.

01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:38.004
- You can put that right there.
- Over here?

01:10:49.082 --> 01:10:51.017
Here.

01:10:52.018 --> 01:10:53.353
Thanks.

01:10:59.593 --> 01:11:01.759
It's so different up here.

01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:03.264
Yeah, I know.

01:11:14.775 --> 01:11:17.044
Yeah, my... my dad uses one.

01:11:17.912 --> 01:11:20.579
I always thought it was weird,

01:11:20.581 --> 01:11:23.283
but then... I dunno,
I understood it.

01:11:23.285 --> 01:11:25.620
- Yeah.
- It felt masculine.

01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:33.295
You know I've seen you before
at the market.

01:11:34.296 --> 01:11:37.132
All those times
before you came up to me.

01:11:40.302 --> 01:11:43.236
I actually started
to look forward to it.

01:11:43.238 --> 01:11:45.307
Feeling you watching me.

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.626
I didn't mean to...

01:12:06.628 --> 01:12:09.165
No, no, no. It's me. I, uh...

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.969
Fuck.

01:12:14.771 --> 01:12:17.972
You just don't know
what it's been like.

01:12:17.974 --> 01:12:21.108
This knot... in my stomach.

01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:23.980
Everywhere I go,
I think I see you.

01:12:26.349 --> 01:12:29.384
My throat is dry all the time.
My head is hazy.

01:12:29.386 --> 01:12:32.989
I... I don't even fucking get dressed in
the morning without thinking about you.

01:12:36.559 --> 01:12:37.994
C'mere.

01:12:40.364 --> 01:12:41.864
C'mere.

01:12:44.868 --> 01:12:46.567
Look, I-I'm sorry. I'm...

01:12:46.569 --> 01:12:50.007
That was so fucking, like,
moronic of me. I...

01:13:08.826 --> 01:13:11.160
What? What? What's the matter?

01:13:11.162 --> 01:13:13.062
- Oh!
- No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

01:13:13.064 --> 01:13:14.998
- No, no!
- I fucked up!

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.167
No, no, no. I'm going through
a really hard time right now.

01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:21.704
I'm going through a really hard time
right now. I'm in the middle of a divorce,

01:13:21.706 --> 01:13:26.244
and, um, he wants to take the garden
from me, because he's a fucking asshole.

01:13:28.413 --> 01:13:30.749
I just...

01:13:31.616 --> 01:13:34.017
You must be so freaked out
right now.

01:13:34.019 --> 01:13:37.053
No, no.
Uh, I-I-I know how it is.

01:13:37.055 --> 01:13:39.756
- No, I can't...
- If-if you... want...

01:13:39.758 --> 01:13:42.525
want me to stay, I...
we can talk.

01:13:42.527 --> 01:13:45.862
I can't believe I unloaded
all this crap on you.

01:13:45.864 --> 01:13:49.532
If... if you ever want to...
talk...

01:13:49.534 --> 01:13:52.071
No.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.574
What is wrong with me?

01:13:58.077 --> 01:14:00.279
You're a fucking teenager!

01:14:04.283 --> 01:14:06.085
Well, uh...

01:14:07.086 --> 01:14:09.287
...thanks for...

01:14:09.289 --> 01:14:10.788
everything.

01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:13.123
Uh...

01:14:43.491 --> 01:14:45.959
<i>Sometimes,
when I'm lying in bed...</i>

01:14:47.328 --> 01:14:50.098
<i>...I think back to when
I didn't know her at all.</i>

01:14:51.999 --> 01:14:54.500
When she was a question mark...

01:14:54.502 --> 01:14:56.938
and I had to fill in
all the blanks.

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:01.142
She was perfect then.

01:15:04.345 --> 01:15:06.447
And as I got to know her...

01:15:09.283 --> 01:15:11.518
...something amazing happened.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.287
I loved her more.

01:15:15.357 --> 01:15:17.524
This is something
I could actually feel.

01:15:17.526 --> 01:15:21.361
Each day, I... could feel...

01:15:21.363 --> 01:15:24.364
my love growing,
like an affliction.

01:15:24.366 --> 01:15:28.570
My heart was growing so big and so
full, it was actually making me choke.

01:15:29.371 --> 01:15:31.039
Mm-hmm. Okay.

01:15:34.309 --> 01:15:36.979
So here we go from this...

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.980
...this bare canvas,

01:15:39.982 --> 01:15:42.384
and all those years in between
and...

01:15:43.051 --> 01:15:45.318
now to that same canvas,

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.889
but now...

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.330
...there are...
there are too many colours.

01:16:00.203 --> 01:16:01.903
It's all muddy, right?

01:16:01.905 --> 01:16:04.238
And I wish I could take
some of that away,

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.341
I wish I could take some of
the paint away, but I can't.

01:16:07.343 --> 01:16:11.781
It's, uh, it's dry, you know.
I can't... I can't change it.

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:20.790
I guess... I guess, uh, what I'm
trying to get around to is...

01:16:22.792 --> 01:16:25.229
...that I'm realizing
that I like it.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.436
That... this muddy painting is...
it's beautiful in its own way.

01:16:34.438 --> 01:16:37.608
The colours all stacked up
on top of each other.

01:16:43.247 --> 01:16:45.617
It's substantial, you know?

01:16:48.719 --> 01:16:50.555
It's heavy.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.827
Carla?

01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:00.632
Do you feel the same way?

01:17:14.079 --> 01:17:15.647
Ma?

01:17:16.982 --> 01:17:18.350
Ma!

01:17:23.656 --> 01:17:25.458
What the fuck?

01:17:30.296 --> 01:17:31.664
Hey.

01:17:33.499 --> 01:17:37.670
Okay, why don't we all just take
a minute and talk about this?

01:17:40.506 --> 01:17:44.041
No, I'm going crazy with all
this passive-aggressive bullshit.

01:17:44.043 --> 01:17:46.644
Either end it or don't.
For godssake,

01:17:46.646 --> 01:17:48.279
I've been holding my breath
for months.

01:17:48.281 --> 01:17:51.117
- Honey, please.
- Ah, who gives a shit?

01:18:13.674 --> 01:18:16.209
I don't think
I've ever seen you cry.

01:18:18.912 --> 01:18:22.349
- I'm allergic to ragweed, so...
- Where you going?

01:18:26.553 --> 01:18:28.723
Do you want me to come with you?

01:19:36.992 --> 01:19:41.261
Now we're just tossing. Alright, let's see 'em.

01:19:41.263 --> 01:19:42.799
Come on.

01:19:52.475 --> 01:19:55.443
- I thought you had asthma.
- So did they.

01:19:55.445 --> 01:19:57.313
Oh, yeah?

01:20:04.822 --> 01:20:09.157
<i>And years later, when I was
in my thirties and drank red wine,</i>

01:20:09.159 --> 01:20:12.830
<i>people called me Howard and asked
me stupid questions at parties...</i>

01:20:13.864 --> 01:20:16.667
<i>...I'd realize
it had all meant something.</i>

01:20:23.207 --> 01:20:25.607
<i>If you asked me
to pick out one,</i>

01:20:25.609 --> 01:20:28.343
<i>a moment that made me,</i>

01:20:28.345 --> 01:20:30.779
<i>that shaped me,</i>

01:20:30.781 --> 01:20:33.348
<i>I'd probably take a deep breath,</i>

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:36.285
<i>look you square in the eye</i>

01:20:36.287 --> 01:20:38.688
<i>and say:</i>

01:20:38.690 --> 01:20:40.625
<i>Hell if I know.</i>

01:20:44.698 --> 01:20:47.196
