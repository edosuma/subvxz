00:05.166 --> 00:06.300

celebrate this moment

00:06.333 --> 00:08.033
by writing you guys a check.

00:08.033 --> 00:09.567
both: Whoa!

00:09.567 --> 00:12.266
- You and Tom are
----ing machines.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.767
You can party and the next
morning, you're all business.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.667
- They keep showing me a guy
who's like, got a lot going on.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.567
You'll know if it's
worth it to keep going,

00:20.600 --> 00:23.000
and I don't think it is.

00:23.033 --> 00:25.667
Am I just not important,

00:25.700 --> 00:27.266
or am I not, like--
- You know what, just,

00:27.300 --> 00:29.100
you need to be my number one.

00:29.133 --> 00:30.500
- Are you guys
going out of town?

00:30.533 --> 00:32.300
- We're going to, uh, Big Bear.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.433
- Scheana's boyfriend Rob
has a house there.

00:36.033 --> 00:37.633
- Thanks for having us!
- Thanks, Rob!

00:37.667 --> 00:40.333
- We have pabbleboards,
bocce ball, music, boats--

00:40.333 --> 00:42.300

00:42.333 --> 00:43.734

coming for my man.

00:43.734 --> 00:46.700
- I have a negative view...
- But James--

00:46.734 --> 00:50.333

the one I love in jeopardy.

00:50.333 --> 00:54.200

I'm just a heavy sleeper.

I think I'm going to
go for a little bit of a run.

02:25.266 --> 02:27.100
- You're going
for a run, yeah, right.

02:27.133 --> 02:29.266

Last night,
when I said I loved Lala,

these feelings that make me

02:46.300 --> 02:48.033

a very interesting friendship,

03:06.133 --> 03:08.400

a couple years ago.

Now they're like bro/sis,
but they fight all the time.

03:12.533 --> 03:14.533
I don't really
get their dynamic,

03:14.567 --> 03:17.500

I do not want
to be cooking again.

03:22.166 --> 03:25.567
cooking breakfast, and Sandoval
makes the best breakfast.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.600
- I think maybe
you should make breakfast.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.567
- Oh, man.
- You're so good at breakfast.

03:29.600 --> 03:33.200
- There's ten people, I think
I saw one dozen eggs in there.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.400
That's kind of like
throwing a cup of water

03:34.433 --> 03:35.667

03:35.700 --> 03:37.200
- Wake his ass up,

03:37.200 --> 03:38.567
- I'm not going
to wake him up yet,

03:38.600 --> 03:41.000
because Rob needs to
put gas in the boat.

18:57.133 --> 19:00.000
I want to go to Vegas.
- I want to come.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.400
I think it would be good
if I'm there because

19:01.433 --> 19:03.133
I know you and Sandoval
have this way of sort of

19:03.133 --> 19:05.233
like enabling one another
to like, misbehave.

19:05.266 --> 19:07.233
Like, stay up all night
at a poker table,

19:07.266 --> 19:09.367
or go get tattoos.
- Not on this trip.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.467
This trip to Vegas,
it's a business trip.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.633
Of course there's always the
chance that it could devolve

19:14.667 --> 19:17.467
into whatever debauchery
we usually get into.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.133
I'm freaking out right now.

19:20.133 --> 19:21.767

to happen this time.

in me for my birthday.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.133
It's my birthday,
and what I say goes.

19:29.166 --> 19:31.000

kidding me, Stassi?

19:31.033 --> 19:32.300

running after her.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.000

19:34.033 --> 19:36.166
I thought everything
would be different.

19:36.166 --> 19:38.633
And it's not totally different.

19:38.667 --> 19:43.767
I'm scared that I'm repeating
the same mistake over again.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.533
- It's so hard not to fall back
into those old habits.

19:45.567 --> 19:47.567
If you're in a bad mood,
or you're drunk,

19:47.567 --> 19:50.400
it gets so hard not to be like,
really, we're doing this again?

19:50.433 --> 19:51.567
Like, you must find yourself
saying that to him.

19:51.567 --> 19:54.533
- Yes, every ----ing day.

19:54.567 --> 19:58.700
- Sucks, I'm seriously sorry.
- You know, and I feel stupid.

19:58.700 --> 20:01.233
Patrick and I
are in this pattern

20:01.266 --> 20:03.000
that we cannot get out of,

20:03.033 --> 20:05.500
where we fight, and break up.

20:05.533 --> 20:09.667
Even hearing me say that,
it sounds crazy.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.066

in relationships.

There's billions of people

20:20.033 --> 20:22.033

who likes psycho girls?

20:26.467 --> 20:28.133

20:28.166 --> 20:29.467

the front or the back?

20:29.467 --> 20:31.000
No, the back
or the front of the board.

I used to go through, like,
a seven pack of condoms--

28:11.033 --> 28:15.700
- She is just the best
being on the planet.

28:15.734 --> 28:18.300
- We all hang out,
and it's always been fine,

28:18.300 --> 28:19.767
but like,
on this trip especially,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.633
I've just noticed the bond
between you guys,

28:22.667 --> 28:25.300
and then like, the bond
between everyone else here,

28:25.300 --> 28:27.133
and it's different.

28:27.166 --> 28:29.533
But the thing is, it's
not you coming on to James.

28:29.567 --> 28:34.033
It's like, James behaving
a certain way around you.

28:35.166 --> 28:38.567
- I'm naked, stop!
- I'm not looking at Lala!

28:40.600 --> 28:42.567
- I feel like
you guys are like,

28:42.600 --> 28:46.433
bonding on a whole other level
than just like, friends.

28:46.467 --> 28:49.200
And I don't see him
doing that with any other girl.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.266
Which makes me concerned.

28:51.300 --> 28:53.166
- Raquel's a sweet girl,

28:53.200 --> 28:55.567
but it takes a tough bitch
to deal with James.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.600
And I don't know
that she's the toughest person.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.433
- Here's the thing.

28:59.467 --> 29:04.200
If I felt like James was acting
a certain way towards me,

29:04.200 --> 29:08.100
there is no way that I would
disrespect my man that way

29:08.100 --> 29:09.700
and allow something
like that to happen.

29:09.734 --> 29:11.166
- Yeah.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.300
- You don't have
anything to worry about.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.633
With me or anybody else.
- Okay.

29:14.633 --> 29:17.033

30:43.300 --> 30:44.633

with George Clooney.

30:50.300 --> 30:51.700
- Yeah.
- I didn't even know that.

30:51.700 --> 30:54.033
- Well, you see,
that, to me, is attractive.

30:54.066 --> 30:56.100
Somebody that's philanthropic,
somebody who's giving.

30:56.133 --> 30:57.567
- It's a reflection
on their character.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.700
- It's also a reflection
of how they are in bed.

30:59.734 --> 31:02.033

- Somebody's who's a selfish

selfish pieces of sh--.

You've probably had

31:20.633 --> 31:22.467
- Okay, I want
to talk about Ken.

31:22.467 --> 31:26.033
You met him at 21,
and then he married you,

31:26.066 --> 31:27.333
what, in six weeks?

31:27.333 --> 31:29.200
- Well we got engaged
after six weeks.

31:29.233 --> 31:31.200
- Oh, engaged.
- And we got married

31:31.200 --> 31:33.033
within three months.

31:33.066 --> 31:36.200
We met through my brother,
and I looked at him.

31:36.233 --> 31:38.166
There was
an instant connection.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.734
- That really happened.

31:40.767 --> 31:44.066
But the first night
that I met him,

31:44.100 --> 31:47.066
he said to me, "I'm not going
to give you my number,

31:47.066 --> 31:48.734
because I think I'm going
to fall in love with you."

31:48.767 --> 31:51.667
- It was the sweetest thing

31:51.700 --> 31:53.600
I ever heard.
- Like, okay, so like,

31:53.600 --> 31:56.300
on the first date, was there
some magic sentence

31:56.333 --> 31:58.233
that you uttered?
- He actually said to me,

31:58.233 --> 31:59.700
"I will never
ask you to marry me

31:59.734 --> 32:01.467
because I know you don't
want to get married."

32:01.500 --> 32:03.300
And I said,
"Well, ask me anyway."

32:03.333 --> 32:06.200
He said "Will you marry me?"
And I said "Yes, I will."

32:06.233 --> 32:07.633
It was kind of a trick,
really, I guess.

32:07.667 --> 32:09.367
- I see what you're saying.
I, you know,

32:09.400 --> 32:12.100

we're just being,

32:12.133 --> 32:14.166
how did you get him,
when he had to get you.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.600
- Yeah.
- And I think it's

32:15.633 --> 32:17.700
that attitude that
attracts people to you.

32:17.734 --> 32:19.567
- But I think every woman
should have that attitude.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.367
- Yes, and this is
why I'm asking.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.467
- You should meet them
on an equal level.

32:23.500 --> 32:26.467
Anything else is not worth
going down that path.

32:28.467 --> 32:30.066

adopt a new mindset.

32:42.433 --> 32:45.333

37:08.066 --> 37:09.567
But I wasn't.
It was just because

37:09.600 --> 37:11.567
I was still a broke
little bus boy.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.333
Her man was the guy
who had all of that,

37:14.333 --> 37:16.200

running along with him.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.467
Do I think that could
have happened? Absolutely.

37:19.467 --> 37:23.567
You know Ray J hit it first
before Kanye, right?

37:23.600 --> 37:26.333

37:26.333 --> 37:27.734
you're going

going to see Lala anymore.

37:29.633 --> 37:33.200
So let's not give each other
that type of decision.

Morning, sunshine.

Well, I hate to be the one
to make you get up,

but we have
to take everything off

38:38.033 --> 38:39.400

in the laundry room.

it was Rob's house.

jets off, cover's locked.

- It's all the sheets,
all the blankets, correct?

38:58.300 --> 39:01.300
- No, not the blankets.
And just, any trash, obviously.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.433

39:03.433 --> 39:05.133
my near-death experience.

I checked the list twice.

It's like an eBay

believes this bullsh--

41:09.100 --> 41:11.533

First of all, Jax is so
threatened by Rob.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.667
Because Rob is taller than him,
better looking than him,

41:18.700 --> 41:20.667
younger than him,
more successful than him.

41:20.700 --> 41:24.133

he wants what Rob and I have.

hard time expressing that.

we don't say it.

If he's not at the point
where he's as in love as I am,

41:56.033 --> 41:57.767
I'm okay with that
because I know he loves me.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.166
I'm sorry--oh, sorry,

Scheana,
were you still talking?

42:00.700 --> 42:02.533

over some other
bullsh-- that he's spewing.

42:04.700 --> 42:08.300
