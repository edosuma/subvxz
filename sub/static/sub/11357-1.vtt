01:12.490 --> 01:15.326
This is the city,
Paris, France.

01:15.535 --> 01:18.079
It is just like
any other big city,

01:18.288 --> 01:21.708
London, New York, Tokyo,

01:21.916 --> 01:24.753
except for two
little things--

01:24.961 --> 01:27.589
in Paris,
people eat better,

01:27.797 --> 01:31.092
and in Paris,
people make love...

01:31.301 --> 01:35.555
Well, perhaps not better,
but certainly more often.

01:37.849 --> 01:41.770
They do it any time,
any place--

01:41.978 --> 01:43.688
on the left bank...

01:46.024 --> 01:47.734
On the right bank...

01:50.695 --> 01:52.697
And in between.

01:54.407 --> 01:56.785
They do it by day,

01:56.993 --> 01:59.579
and they do it by night.

02:01.456 --> 02:04.125
The butcher...

02:04.334 --> 02:06.294
The Baker...

02:06.503 --> 02:09.214
And the friendly
undertaker.

02:13.259 --> 02:17.055
They do it in motion.

02:17.263 --> 02:21.476
They do it sitting
absolutely still.

02:21.684 --> 02:24.479
Poodles do it.

02:24.687 --> 02:26.773
Tourists do it.

02:27.941 --> 02:30.193
Generals do it.

02:34.155 --> 02:38.618
Once in a while,
even existentialists do it.

02:42.831 --> 02:44.791
There is young love...

02:47.335 --> 02:49.254
And old love.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.804
Married love...

03:01.766 --> 03:05.019
And illicit love.

03:05.228 --> 03:08.481
That is where I come in.

03:08.690 --> 03:11.025
My name is Claude Chavasse.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.946
I am what you would call
the private eye.

03:15.155 --> 03:18.324
It was Monday, June 11th,
6:15 A.M.

03:18.533 --> 03:20.326
I had been working
the night watch

03:20.535 --> 03:23.663
on the Place Vendome
outside the Ritz Hotel.

03:41.890 --> 03:44.392
In order to protect
the innocent,

03:44.601 --> 03:48.021
I will call this
the case of Madame X.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.023
Of course she was not
entirely innocent.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.192
While Monsieur X
was attending

03:52.400 --> 03:54.819
a business conference
in London,

03:55.028 --> 03:58.698
she was conferring nightly
in suite 14 of The Ritz.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.938
8:45 A.M.

04:30.146 --> 04:33.107
I arrived at number 17
rue Mallebranche

04:33.316 --> 04:35.068
this is where I live.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.237
This is also
where I have my office.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.864
It is a very quiet
neighborhood.

My clients
prefer it this way.

04:43.618 --> 04:44.786
Bonjour, madame.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.329
Bonjour,
Monsieur Chavasse.

04:48.248 --> 04:51.209
It is a neat, normal life
we have here.

04:51.417 --> 04:54.754
There is just myself,
my daughter, and her cello.

The symphony.
Haydn's <i>88th.</i>

I tell you what I'm doing,
but you never tell me.

06:26.596 --> 06:28.181
That's because I love you,

Ariane, please.

07:21.401 --> 07:23.194
He's very attractive.

07:23.403 --> 07:25.029
He's very
objectionable

07:25.238 --> 07:26.406

He is?

07:27.990 --> 07:29.450
And utterly no good.

07:29.659 --> 07:30.868
What did he do?

07:31.077 --> 07:32.203
That's enough.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.294
I don't think I've ever
seen his face in the files.

Ariane,
you've been told

07:50.847 --> 07:52.932
to stay away
from those files.

07:53.141 --> 07:55.977
I've been trying, papa,
but they're so fascinating.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.104
At the conservatory,
all the girls envy me

07:58.312 --> 08:00.273
because I have
my private library.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.649
Library.

08:01.858 --> 08:03.317
This is not a library.

This is a sewer.

I guess my favorite one's
in file "D."

had a heart attack

08:25.006 --> 08:27.425

up the Matterhorn.

08:27.633 --> 08:30.845
How she must have loved him
to give up everything--

08:31.053 --> 08:34.682
the Duke, the castles,
the horses, and the hounds.

08:34.890 --> 08:38.186
For what? 2 weeks
of shameless passion.

08:38.394 --> 08:41.022
2 glorious weeks.

08:41.230 --> 08:44.525
It was a terrible scandal
with a terrible end.

08:44.734 --> 08:45.818
But it was worth it...

08:46.027 --> 08:47.528
What woman
could ask for more

08:47.737 --> 08:49.697
than to die together
with her lover,

08:49.906 --> 08:51.324
buried under an avalanche,

08:51.532 --> 08:53.284
locked in each other's
arms forever?

08:53.493 --> 08:57.538
Nonsense. They'll thaw out,
and that will be it.

08:57.747 --> 09:01.209
How can you be so cruel?

09:01.417 --> 09:03.211
Don't you have
any sympathy?

09:03.419 --> 09:05.630
I do. My sympathy
is with the Duke

09:05.838 --> 09:07.632
and the horses
and the hounds.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.009
How about the case
of the benedictine monk

09:10.218 --> 09:12.887

the love of a young widow?

09:13.095 --> 09:16.224

the secret formula

09:16.432 --> 09:17.391

by her husband.

29:57.464 --> 29:58.256
Are you?

29:58.465 --> 30:00.425
I don't think so.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.095
It's all very confusing.

30:05.722 --> 30:06.931
May I use your phone?

30:07.140 --> 30:08.767
Go ahead.
Help yourself.

30:12.937 --> 30:15.190
Hello.
Give me the concierge.

30:18.109 --> 30:19.652
Concierge, is there
another Frank Flannagan

30:19.861 --> 30:21.988
in this hotel?

30:22.197 --> 30:24.115
Well, is there
another suite 14?

30:25.992 --> 30:28.703
This is The Ritz,
isn't it?

30:33.166 --> 30:35.585
I'm terribly sorry,

30:35.794 --> 30:39.172
but you must understand.
I--I'm terribly nervous.

30:39.380 --> 30:40.590
Have some of this.

30:40.799 --> 30:43.176
It's so preposterous.

30:43.384 --> 30:46.012
Apparently, I am the victim
of misinformation--

30:46.221 --> 30:48.181
a case
of mistaken identity.

30:48.389 --> 30:49.265
Cheers.

30:49.474 --> 30:50.517
Cheers.

30:51.726 --> 30:53.686

30:53.895 --> 30:55.146
I can smell
my wife's perfume.

30:55.355 --> 30:56.314
Hmm?

While you're looking,

31:35.854 --> 31:38.356
if you happen to find
my left slipper...

32:00.879 --> 32:02.672
Is this it?

32:02.881 --> 32:03.923
Thank you!

32:04.132 --> 32:06.593
I'm sorry
to cause you trouble.

32:06.801 --> 32:07.927
It's no trouble.
I'm glad you came.

32:08.136 --> 32:09.721
I've been trying to find
this for a week.

32:09.929 --> 32:13.433
I was so upset,

32:13.641 --> 32:17.353
I went to a Turkish bath
for 3 massages.

32:17.562 --> 32:18.396
You look good.

32:18.605 --> 32:19.647
Thank you.

you're going to the analyst.

32:45.506 --> 32:47.091
Bad dog!

32:47.300 --> 32:49.636
When I saw you
in the corridor,

32:49.844 --> 32:51.971
I could have sworn
you were my wife.

32:52.180 --> 32:54.057
You mustn't jump
to conclusions.

32:54.265 --> 32:56.142
Yeah.

32:56.351 --> 32:58.978
Actually,
you don't look like her.

32:59.187 --> 33:01.230
My wife is much more...

33:01.439 --> 33:02.732
Not that she's heavy.

33:02.941 --> 33:04.651
She's very beautiful,

33:04.859 --> 33:07.153
she's one of the most
beautiful women in the world.

33:07.362 --> 33:08.446
I'm sure she is.

33:08.655 --> 33:10.490
I do wish
you could meet her.

33:10.698 --> 33:12.909
Well, maybe
some other time.

33:13.117 --> 33:14.744
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.

33:14.953 --> 33:16.621
I understand.

33:16.829 --> 33:19.123
Good night, madame.
Good night, monsieur.

33:19.332 --> 33:20.333
Good night.

33:20.541 --> 33:21.417
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

33:23.628 --> 33:26.839
Perhaps I'd better
put this back on.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.299
Ha ha ha!

33:30.677 --> 33:31.803
How about that guy?

33:32.011 --> 33:34.138
Told his wife
he was in London!

33:34.347 --> 33:36.432
You can't trust
a husband anymore.

33:36.641 --> 33:38.017
If it hadn't been
for you...

33:38.226 --> 33:39.435
I'd have got...

33:39.644 --> 33:41.521
I was glad to do it.

A madman running around
The Ritz with a loaded gun!

33:44.232 --> 33:45.692
Ever hear of such a thing?

33:45.900 --> 33:47.110
It's nothing unusual.

33:47.318 --> 33:48.987
There are 7,000 hotels
in Paris,

33:49.195 --> 33:51.030
220,000 hotel rooms,

33:51.239 --> 33:53.616
and in approximately
40,000 of them,

33:53.825 --> 33:55.702
especially
on a night like this--

33:55.910 --> 33:57.120
what are you
talking about?

33:57.328 --> 33:59.038
These are
official figures.

33:59.247 --> 34:00.206
Good night, Mr. Flannagan.

34:00.415 --> 34:01.332
Good night.

34:01.541 --> 34:02.625
It was nice
meeting you.

Wait! You can't go.

Who are you?

34:06.212 --> 34:07.672
Oh, that's not
important.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.172
You seem to know
who <i>I</i> am.

34:09.382 --> 34:10.507
You're Frank Flannagan--

34:10.717 --> 34:13.511
American, oil,
construction business,

34:13.719 --> 34:16.139
turbojet engines,
Pepsi-cola,

34:16.347 --> 34:18.516
and you hit the spot.

34:18.725 --> 34:21.686
How did you know about
the husband coming here?

34:21.893 --> 34:24.355
You are 6'3",

34:24.563 --> 34:27.065
but you don't look like
Abraham Lincoln.

34:27.275 --> 34:29.235
Who said I did?

34:29.444 --> 34:32.405
How did you know
about tonight?

34:32.612 --> 34:34.532
A friend of a friend
of a friend.

34:34.741 --> 34:37.493

of a friend of--whose?

34:37.702 --> 34:40.996
Tell me.
Why did you warn me?

34:41.205 --> 34:43.081
Why?

34:43.291 --> 34:45.877
It's simple.
I'm against violence.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.545
In my opinion, there's too much
shooting in the world

34:48.755 --> 34:50.005
and not enough love.

34:50.214 --> 34:51.841
How's that again?

34:52.050 --> 34:53.259
If people
loved each other more,

34:53.467 --> 34:55.887
they'd shoot
each other less.

34:58.056 --> 35:01.893
Are you a religious fanatic
or something?

35:02.101 --> 35:03.186
[Knock on door]

35:05.271 --> 35:06.439

35:06.647 --> 35:08.858
It's me again.
The husband.

35:18.910 --> 35:19.911
Come in.

35:22.205 --> 35:24.207
I'm sorry to make
a nuisance of myself,

35:24.415 --> 35:27.210
but I forgot something.
I bought it in London.

35:27.418 --> 35:30.254
I guess they'll take it back.
I still have the sales slip.

35:30.463 --> 35:31.297
Good-bye.

35:31.506 --> 35:32.757
Good-bye.

Good-bye.

35:44.977 --> 35:47.271
You can't go now.
He may be watching.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.148
I think
he's still suspicious.

35:49.357 --> 35:52.068
But it's
getting late.

35:52.276 --> 35:53.945

the gypsies back.

36:01.369 --> 36:02.495

A little
background music.

36:14.132 --> 36:16.092
It's amazing what
fiddles can do for you,

36:16.300 --> 36:18.636
especially
if you're not a talker,

36:18.845 --> 36:21.347
and I'm not
much of a talker.

36:21.556 --> 36:23.474
When you're
traveling around--

36:23.683 --> 36:27.478
Madrid, Rome,
the Scandinavian countries--

36:27.687 --> 36:29.313
do you take
your gypsies along?

36:29.522 --> 36:31.357
Of course not.

36:31.566 --> 36:36.362
Except once I had them
join me in Stockholm.

of the twin sisters.

Quite a bit.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.831
Aren't you a little
too young for that?

36:47.039 --> 36:50.001
I was about to ask you
a similar question.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.628
Aren't you a little
too old for that?

36:52.837 --> 36:54.380
That hurts.

36:54.589 --> 36:57.383
First you save a man's life
and then stab him. Is that kind?

36:57.592 --> 37:00.887
I take it back,

37:01.095 --> 37:02.889
if you take back
what you said.

37:03.097 --> 37:05.224
I take it back.

conceited and clumsy

37:10.855 --> 37:13.232

I quite agree.

37:17.737 --> 37:20.239
This? Champagne.

37:20.448 --> 37:24.869
I know. With fish,
you have white wine.

With gypsies,
champagne. Right?

37:27.455 --> 37:30.166
Right. We'll have

Positive.

She's not what
you'd call a dame.

Why, the little liar.

Why do you suppose
she did it?

To put herself in
the same class with you.

Too late for what?

Whenever a girl gets
serious, you run.

01:58:55.171 --> 01:58:58.049
She's very serious,
so start running.
