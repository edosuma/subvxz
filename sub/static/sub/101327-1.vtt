WEBVTT

00:14.710 --> 00:17.974
The future was
anything but certain.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.455
These were the times
that tested the courage

00:20.498 --> 00:24.111
of our convictions and
the strength of our union.

00:24.154 --> 00:28.637
One year ago,
I took office amid two wars,

00:28.680 --> 00:32.206
and the economy
rocked by a severe recession.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.643
The financial system
on the verge of collapse

00:34.686 --> 00:36.645
and a government deeply in debt.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.778
Experts from across
the political spectrum warned

00:39.822 --> 00:41.693
that if we did not act--

00:41.737 --> 00:46.437
♪ Angel, angel, come to me

00:49.484 --> 00:53.966
♪ Angel, angel, set me free

00:54.010 --> 00:54.880
Hey, kiddo.

00:57.753 --> 01:01.539
♪ I need you and you need me

01:01.583 --> 01:04.412
I want you to know
that I've spoken with him

01:04.455 --> 01:06.979
and he's never
gonna do that to you again.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.897
You don't believe me.

01:11.941 --> 01:15.640
Do you believe
that God writes a story

01:15.684 --> 01:17.816
for every soul that's ever born?

01:21.516 --> 01:23.518
I've never
looked at it that way.

01:24.562 --> 01:26.086
Is that what you believe?

01:28.740 --> 01:29.785
I think God does.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.703
And how do you
think your story ends?

01:36.487 --> 01:37.923
Like all good stories.

01:39.708 --> 01:40.578
With justice.

01:42.058 --> 01:42.972
Justice.

01:45.975 --> 01:48.151
But doesn't that assume

01:48.195 --> 01:50.762
that everyone has
done something wrong?

01:50.806 --> 01:53.025
Something that
they should pay for?

01:57.726 --> 02:00.685
Everybody's guilty
of something, Doctor.

02:02.078 --> 02:02.948
Okay.

02:10.042 --> 02:12.088
What the fuck?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.568
Oh God!

02:25.754 --> 02:29.453
Dear diary,
is it my fault that I was born

02:29.497 --> 02:31.542
into the age of
Instagramification?

02:32.935 --> 02:35.677
Oh yeah, that is hot.
More of that please.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.722
The age where
our normal consists

02:37.766 --> 02:41.291
of projecting the most
mundane moments

02:41.335 --> 02:43.598
of our day out to anyone,

02:43.641 --> 02:45.861
who for whatever reason they
have wants to see them.

02:45.904 --> 02:48.168
Wants to keep up with our lives

02:48.211 --> 02:50.561
through the screen on
their phone.

02:50.605 --> 02:54.565
My awesome brunch,
the cool places I get to go,

02:54.609 --> 02:57.655
the fancy people
I get to party with,

02:57.699 --> 02:59.091
and it terrifies me.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.834
Give me the pouty lip thing
that you do.

03:03.922 --> 03:06.838
Yeah, yeah, that's it,
that's it.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.666
-Which is why...
-Yeah, that's it right there.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.668
...without you I would be lost,

03:10.712 --> 03:13.889
without my unplugged sanctuary
from this world

03:13.932 --> 03:18.502
that is wired for insanity,
I would lose my mind.

03:18.546 --> 03:21.375
What's your comfort level
showing' some skin?

03:22.376 --> 03:26.249
What I can tell you is not
for anyone.

03:26.293 --> 03:32.255
Not my 117,000 followers,
or 2,341 friends.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.344
Not creepy photographers.

03:34.388 --> 03:39.306
No, this is only

03:39.349 --> 03:42.134
for us.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.875
Okay.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.225
Oh, I think you got it.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.143
Seriously, if you're ever
interested in doing

03:51.187 --> 03:54.146
-some more artistic work
sometime...
-Mm-hmm.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.061
The rate is much higher.

03:58.063 --> 04:01.328
And what is your idea of more
artistic work?

04:01.371 --> 04:05.636
Series of black and whites
that capture the true essence
of the female form.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.509
It's very classy.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.600
What?

04:12.643 --> 04:14.645
Look, it's not like
it's porn or anything.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.125
Yeah.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.213
Not interested.

04:19.954 --> 04:22.914
-I'll post these next week.
-Great.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.612
Hey, if there are any standouts
from this one

04:24.655 --> 04:26.440
I'll make some prints.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.398
And if I do, I'll give you one.

04:28.442 --> 04:29.921
Sounds good.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.723
Yeah, definitely.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.551
Definitely, definitely,
definitely.

04:50.594 --> 04:53.423
Dude, let me call you back,
lemme call you back.

04:55.773 --> 04:56.905
You never called.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.342
Nice try, 'kay?

04:59.386 --> 05:00.256
The other night?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.301
Whiskey Go-Go?

05:03.390 --> 05:06.044
You've got me confused with
someone else, okay?

05:06.958 --> 05:09.047
You asked me for my number.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.919
Are you one of those girls who
takes a guy's number

05:10.962 --> 05:14.792
and never calls him 'cause
that's really messed up.

05:17.578 --> 05:19.319
You don't remember me, do you?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.582
How wasted were you?

05:38.990 --> 05:40.644
What's up, crazy?

05:40.688 --> 05:42.385
Yeah, we really
don't need to talk.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.127
Axel shit on the bed again.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.911
Oh, good boy!

05:46.955 --> 05:49.914
Oh hi!
Who wants to go for a walk?

05:49.958 --> 05:52.961
I think Axel wants to go for a
walk, okay, go get your leash!

05:53.004 --> 05:55.485
Go get your leash, yay,
good boy!

05:55.529 --> 05:57.618
Can you just shut up and get out
of here already?

05:57.661 --> 05:59.010
Ugh, everything will
be out on Thursday,

05:59.054 --> 06:00.838
I'd appreciate it if you
weren't here.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.884
I mean if that isn't
too much to ask now, is it?

06:04.973 --> 06:07.715
You know,
I really don't get you.

06:07.758 --> 06:10.370
That's funny,
because I get you completely.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.677
So what, everything
you said was bullshit?

06:13.721 --> 06:16.680
And what specifically
are you referring to?

06:16.724 --> 06:20.728
Don't you fuckin' play
your mind games with me.

06:24.819 --> 06:25.689
Stand down.

06:28.213 --> 06:31.739
You're both sick, you and that
mentally challenged dog.

06:31.782 --> 06:34.219
I'm glad to be done with
the both of you.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.222
So how was your shoot?

06:37.266 --> 06:38.310
Oh, another rooftop.

06:38.354 --> 06:40.400
You are so the rooftop girl.

06:40.443 --> 06:43.664
Oh yes, darling, it is so
glamorous to live my life.

06:43.707 --> 06:45.143
I'd kill to have your life.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.232
Pft, how sweet of you to say.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.931
-So, who shot you?
-Ugh, Kevin.

06:49.974 --> 06:53.413
Holy shit, he's got like
literally over 9800 followers.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.893
-And he's still a creep.
-Well, can you
hook me up with him?

06:55.937 --> 06:58.896
No, no, no, trust me, you do not
wanna shoot with this guy,
he's like,

06:58.940 --> 07:01.725
the Harvey Weinstein
of Instagram photographers.

07:01.769 --> 07:05.686
Yeah, but he's got, like,
literally over 9800 followers.

07:05.729 --> 07:08.166
Oh my God, like literally,
or literally literally?

07:08.210 --> 07:10.342
Can you please just invite him
to your party?

07:10.386 --> 07:11.909
This would be great
exposure for me.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.389
Wait, why don't you just
cast a spell

07:13.433 --> 07:14.434
to get more followers?

07:14.477 --> 07:16.000
-Ha ha.
-Fuck you.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.698
Love you with all my heart.

07:17.741 --> 07:18.612
Not anymore.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.443
Welcome to Comparative Religion.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.185
Or what you get a degree in
when no religion

07:27.229 --> 07:29.840
you subscribe to would have you
as a follower.

07:32.669 --> 07:36.194
The Babylonian myth of human
creation opens with the words...

07:38.588 --> 07:40.938
Inuma

07:42.462 --> 07:43.811
Ilu

07:45.508 --> 07:47.684
Awilum.

07:48.772 --> 07:51.514
Or, "when the gods were human."

07:51.558 --> 07:53.473
The language indicates a belief

07:53.516 --> 07:56.954
that a piece of the gods was
also once present in humans.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.043
Humans.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.917
Similar to Adam in the J text of
the old testament.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.571
Made out of clay

08:04.614 --> 08:06.181
which was then mixed with blood

08:06.224 --> 08:08.618
by the rebellious
God of knowledge.

08:08.662 --> 08:13.449
Now in that way humans shared
a divine gift of understanding

08:13.493 --> 08:16.191
and received something immortal.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.541
The spirit.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.155
What can I say?

08:24.199 --> 08:26.680
He's hot as fuck.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.943
Not hot like the guys my age
think is hot.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.728
Not texting me "sup"
and then expecting me

08:31.772 --> 08:34.251
to come over, give them
a blowjob while they play

08:34.296 --> 08:35.818
a first-person shooter game hot.

08:35.863 --> 08:36.994
No.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.212
No, no, no, no.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.998
I'm talking like old-school hot.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.740
Like taking me out to
a four-star restaurant

08:43.784 --> 08:46.917
then taking me to the opera,
taking me home,

08:46.961 --> 08:50.530
holding me down and choking me
just the right amount

08:50.573 --> 08:54.490
as he keeps me safe forever.
That kind of hot.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.492
You know, I would say I have daddy issues

08:56.536 --> 08:58.712
but since I can't remember
either one of my parents,

08:58.755 --> 09:00.104
what does it matter?

09:00.148 --> 09:03.020
Hi, I'm Sarah,
I'm auditing class.

09:03.064 --> 09:08.156
So wait, if the immortal spirit
is man's soul,

09:08.199 --> 09:12.595
wouldn't that mean that
our souls are actually
foreign to our bodies?

09:13.988 --> 09:16.991
Well, I suppose you could
see it that way.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.558
Okay, and doesn't that mean

09:18.601 --> 09:22.431
that our entire
Judeo-Christian society

09:22.474 --> 09:26.304
is actually
built on the idea that

09:26.348 --> 09:29.481
some alien force is driving
our bodies?

09:29.525 --> 09:31.396
I'm not sure I follow you.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.790
I'm asking
if what you're saying is

09:33.834 --> 09:37.838
that our souls
are in fact alien invaders?

09:39.013 --> 09:41.624
Sarah, I think you're auditing
the wrong class.

09:41.668 --> 09:44.148
Advanced abnormal psychology is
down the hall.

09:46.542 --> 09:49.414
But actually,
Sarah brings up a valid point.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.548
What's the difference between
a god infusing a piece

09:52.592 --> 09:54.376
of themselves into a human

09:54.419 --> 09:57.118
and demonic

09:58.946 --> 09:59.816
possession?

10:01.252 --> 10:02.950
Now in many cultures
around the world,

10:02.993 --> 10:06.214
possession states are part of
normal cultural practice.

10:06.257 --> 10:09.783
These possession states become
disorders when unwanted,

10:11.219 --> 10:15.658
cause distress or impairment
and are not accepted

10:15.702 --> 10:20.620
as part of a cultural or
societal norm in one society.

10:22.578 --> 10:25.015
Okay, that's all
we have time for today.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.582
For those of you who don't
know her,

10:26.626 --> 10:30.325
this is Marie Clark,
your extraordinarily,

10:30.368 --> 10:33.241
brilliant, and gifted TA.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.939
Get your papers
to her by Thursday.

10:35.983 --> 10:36.984
I'm gonna go.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.684
Next week we will
explore plot similarities

10:41.728 --> 10:43.555
between the
Sumerian epic Gilgamesh,

10:43.599 --> 10:47.908
and the iconic
James Bond, Dr. No.

10:47.951 --> 10:51.868
What does this have to do
with comparative religion,
you ask.

10:51.912 --> 10:55.350
Nothing, I just think it's cool
they have the same plot.

10:59.354 --> 11:00.964
Marie.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.531
Marie!

11:02.574 --> 11:04.228
Hey.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.142
Hey.

11:06.709 --> 11:09.059
You're moving in to your new
apartment this weekend, huh?

11:09.103 --> 11:11.192
-You remembered.
-Yeah.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.889
So you all set,
you need any help?

11:12.933 --> 11:15.718
Oh no, trust me, you do not
wanna lug in my couch.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.460
Well, I've been known to lug
a few couches in my day.

11:18.503 --> 11:22.159
No, I'm good, my friend Richard
is helping me out too
on the side.

11:22.203 --> 11:24.727
I don't have that much stuff.

11:24.771 --> 11:25.641
Great.

11:27.512 --> 11:31.560
I am having
a small party on Saturday.

11:31.603 --> 11:35.216
I mean, if you wanna come,
maybe give it your blessing.

11:35.259 --> 11:39.699
Hmm. Well, would you prefer
a blessing from Enki or Enlil?

11:40.830 --> 11:43.746
Do you really need to ask?

11:44.660 --> 11:46.140
-Enki.
-Enki.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.057
Well, I'll see you there.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.591
And your aunt was hostile
towards you growing up

12:02.634 --> 12:04.898
and you always felt that
that was unfair.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.031
I don't mean
to sound ungrateful.

12:08.075 --> 12:12.514
You know, Aunt Rebecca was
generous to take me in.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.125
She didn't have to do that.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.955
You know,
everything was fine until...

12:18.999 --> 12:22.002
She blamed you for
your uncle's death.

12:22.045 --> 12:25.266
Even though you had
nothing to do with it.

12:25.309 --> 12:30.880
So do you feel guilty about his
death in any way?

12:30.924 --> 12:31.794
No.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.232
Just sad for Aunt Rebecca.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.630
I wanna go back to your

12:41.673 --> 12:43.893
infatuation with your professor,

12:43.937 --> 12:46.113
this, uh, what was his name?

12:46.156 --> 12:50.073
-Ah, Harris, yes.
-Infatuation?

12:50.117 --> 12:54.469
-Well, have you acted on
your desires with him?
-Yeah, no, no.

12:54.512 --> 12:58.038
-So what, no, is that a
I can't quite-no, yes, no?
-That's a yes. No.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.431
-No, I, I--
-You sure, this is a no now?

13:00.475 --> 13:01.911
It's a hard no.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.521
- It's a no, okay.
-No I haven't.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.437
I got it.
So now, are you going to?

13:06.481 --> 13:09.658
Can't a schoolgirl
just have a crush?

13:11.486 --> 13:13.793
Marie, I just want you to

13:13.836 --> 13:15.838
be careful with
this relationship.

13:15.882 --> 13:19.537
I mean, there's something
you're trying to explore

13:19.581 --> 13:23.237
from your past,
and your professor is
giving you the lens.

13:23.280 --> 13:27.154
I just don't think that
it's that healthy

13:27.197 --> 13:28.503
for you to go there.

13:31.898 --> 13:35.031
I'm done
trying to remember my past.

13:36.511 --> 13:37.860
I'll never know
what really happened

13:37.904 --> 13:41.342
so I'm moving forward.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.780
Well, I think that is wonderful.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.521
Yeah, no truly, I'm all good,
I'm good.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.871
I believe, I do, I do.

13:48.915 --> 13:54.007
Let the past live where it
belongs .

13:54.050 --> 13:56.313
God knows you deserve it.

13:56.357 --> 14:00.752
You deserve to be happy, hmm?

14:01.928 --> 14:02.798
I'm trying.

14:08.108 --> 14:11.938
I hope you know how
much I love you.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.722
Oh, like no other.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.550
Where is this going?
Please pick down.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.900
Okay, okay, back, back,
back, okay.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.380
I'm losing it,
I'm losing it.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.251
Okay, okay, okay,
right here.

14:22.731 --> 14:23.993
Here for now, okay?

14:24.037 --> 14:25.734
I think it's great
forever, yeah.

14:25.777 --> 14:28.171
Okay, for now.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.826
Oh.

14:32.654 --> 14:33.916
Where's Axel?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.876
-Exploring the building.
-Right.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.921
I wish I could wander around
the halls of any place

14:38.965 --> 14:42.359
I just moved into and
claim any particular spot

14:42.403 --> 14:45.362
I wanted with
a few drops of piss.

14:47.408 --> 14:48.452
How many is that?

14:48.496 --> 14:51.716
118,216.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.632
-Oh, 17!

14:54.676 --> 14:56.547
Fame whore.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.985
Whatever, okay,
over 120,000 followers

14:59.028 --> 15:01.248
and I can pay off
my student loans.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.597
Are you poor?

15:02.640 --> 15:04.381
Oh, I didn't know.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.253
Help me, I'm poor.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.908
-I was born with a trust fund.
-Oh, I know.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.735
-As I may have told you.
-Mm.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.389
Which means
that from the age of two

15:12.433 --> 15:14.826
I had it burned into my head
that my sole purpose

15:14.870 --> 15:20.049
in life was not to lose
the family fortune.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.790
Money's always been
a burden for me, really.

15:21.833 --> 15:26.838
Wow. It must be so hard
to be so rich.

15:26.882 --> 15:29.232
Yes, you plebs have no idea.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.632
Okay, give it back.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.112
Is this a diary?

15:39.155 --> 15:40.504
No, just give it back.

15:40.548 --> 15:43.203
Oh, how 20th century of thee.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.682
Okay, come on, okay,
give it back, give it back.

15:44.726 --> 15:45.901
-No, stop!
-"Dear diary, I'd really like--"

15:45.945 --> 15:47.337
It's for me, okay!

15:47.381 --> 15:48.425
All right.

15:51.080 --> 15:51.994
Blow a gasket.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.909
It's only for me.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.221
I won't touch it again.

16:01.264 --> 16:02.135
Yeah.

16:14.016 --> 16:17.367
You're ridiculous.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.716
You're ridiculous.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.157
Richard put his hands
on you yesterday

16:24.200 --> 16:27.638
and I nearly ripped
his goddamn head off.

16:27.682 --> 16:30.685
I think I might be over
protective of you.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.602
I have no idea what
I would do without you.

16:36.343 --> 16:38.345
Am I becoming obsessed with you?

16:38.388 --> 16:41.478
No, okay, I'm gonna take
Brighton's advice,

16:41.522 --> 16:44.264
find another outlet
and paying it forward

16:44.307 --> 16:47.571
by helping those who are not in as good a place as I am.

16:49.791 --> 16:53.012
Love is the name for
our pursuit of wholeness.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.406
For our desire to be complete.

16:57.364 --> 17:01.194
According to Greek mythology,
humans were originally created

17:01.237 --> 17:06.329
with four arms, four legs
and a head with two faces.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.202
Fearing their power,

17:09.244 --> 17:12.988
Zeus split them into
two separate parts

17:13.031 --> 17:16.339
condemning them to
spend their lives

17:16.383 --> 17:18.428
in search of their...

17:21.605 --> 17:23.564
We'll pick it up here
next week, yeah?

17:23.607 --> 17:24.478
Okay.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.482
Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark,

17:28.525 --> 17:31.050
-bark, bark, bark. Hold on,
-Marie, Marie!

17:31.093 --> 17:33.269
I'll be right back,
be right back.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.054
Marie, Marie wait a second.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.577
Marie!

18:23.232 --> 18:25.234
Now you strike me

18:25.278 --> 18:27.367
as having had
a military background.

18:27.410 --> 18:30.457
Aah, you're perceptive.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.155
-I was in intel for the 114.
-Oh.

18:33.199 --> 18:36.332
-You?
-Mm, me? No.

18:36.376 --> 18:37.377
Flat feet.

18:39.074 --> 18:41.381
So do you always party
with your patients?

18:41.424 --> 18:46.168
You always
party with your students?

18:49.040 --> 18:50.520
Alex, hi, hi!

18:51.521 --> 18:54.089
This place looks great!

18:54.133 --> 18:55.873
Thank you
so much for this, truly,

18:55.917 --> 18:57.527
you are a life saver.

18:57.571 --> 19:00.356
I'm sorry things worked out
rough with Bobby.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.315
I did warn you, didn't I?

19:02.358 --> 19:05.056
You did, and you were right.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.755
But thank you for this, truly.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.452
I promise to be a good tenant.

19:09.496 --> 19:12.977
Well, you won't have to worry
about anything here.

19:14.718 --> 19:15.806
What's this?

19:15.850 --> 19:17.591
Security cameras.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.941
You can actually see everything
that goes on here

19:19.984 --> 19:21.986
on your phone whenever you want.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.466
You can watch me?

19:23.510 --> 19:26.426
Oh, God no, no, you have
control over everything.

19:26.469 --> 19:30.169
-You just have to download
the app and reset the password.
-Mm-kay.

19:30.212 --> 19:33.041
You can alert the police too
so they can see what's
going on in here.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.825
I don't think
that's gonna be necessary

19:34.869 --> 19:36.740
but good to know, thank you.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.918
Perfect.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.572
Okay, so before you say anything

19:42.616 --> 19:44.792
I just want you to know that
I had nothing to do

19:44.835 --> 19:46.315
with Bobby finding out
about this party.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.361
Mm-hmm, how'd he get my address?

19:48.404 --> 19:49.927
Uh, I don't know.

19:50.841 --> 19:51.886
Give me that.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.240
Thanks.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.851
I'm sorry, and I love you.

20:00.895 --> 20:02.157
And I just had to come here
as a man

20:02.201 --> 20:03.724
to tell you that to your face.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.247
And if you want me
to turn away now

20:05.291 --> 20:07.162
and walk away for
the rest of my life

20:07.206 --> 20:09.686
-just say the word
and that's what I'll do.
-Walk away.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.253
Oh come on, baby,
don't be like that.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.776
Look, I think it's time for
you to go.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.430
You a watch maker?

20:14.474 --> 20:15.649
Excuse me?

20:15.692 --> 20:18.391
-Do you make watches?
-No.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.654
Then who the fuck are you
to tell me when it's time
for me to go?

20:20.697 --> 20:23.744
-I don't want any trouble.
-You're damn right you don't
want trouble.

20:23.787 --> 20:26.225
What you wanna do is
go walk away

20:26.268 --> 20:28.966
and keep on enjoying your
fucking trouble free existence.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.099
All right, all right, all right.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.100
That's enough.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.711
We're at a party, okay?

20:34.755 --> 20:37.845
Gentleman don't act like this
at a party.

20:37.888 --> 20:38.846
Who the fuck are you?

20:39.890 --> 20:41.196
I'm Gregory Harris.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.243
Bobby D'Angelino.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.856
-Can I ask you something, Bobby?
-You may.

20:49.857 --> 20:52.120
Were you born
this much of an asshole

20:52.163 --> 20:53.600
or did you just grow up
that way?

20:53.643 --> 20:55.254
What the fuck did you just
say to me?

20:55.297 --> 20:57.430
I said get the fuck outta here.

20:58.605 --> 20:59.823
Now.

21:01.695 --> 21:02.826
You're crazy, man.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.004
You have no idea.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.621
You're all fuckin' nuts.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.670
You deserve whatever
you got coming' to you.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.418
-Hi!
-Hey! Hey.

21:30.724 --> 21:33.161
Please meet my star pupil,
Marie Clark.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.598
Marie, this is my wife, Amelia.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.687
-How do you do?
-So nice to meet you.

21:37.731 --> 21:41.082
Gregory just can't stop talking
about how wonderful you are.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.563
So sorry you had to see that.

21:43.606 --> 21:45.608
I can't believe that's your
first impression of me.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.262
Oh please don't worry.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.047
My impression of you is just
beginning to form.

21:50.091 --> 21:50.961
I need a drink.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.187
Made a new friend.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.145
-Say hello.
-Hello.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.410
Come on, let's go, hurry up!

22:09.153 --> 22:10.851
So what do you like to shoot on?

22:15.116 --> 22:17.945
-What are you doing here?
-What's the problem? I don't
understand what's the problem.

22:17.988 --> 22:20.513
The problem is you brought me
to a college kegger right now.

22:20.556 --> 22:22.384
I brought you to
my student's party.

22:22.428 --> 22:25.518
She invited me, I don't
understand what the problem is.

22:27.215 --> 22:28.825
Hi.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.000
I'm Marie.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.350
I know.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.263
Do I know you?

22:32.307 --> 22:34.048
I'm a friend of Sarah's.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.746
Why are you holding my phone?

22:36.790 --> 22:39.314
Oh, is this yours,
I didn't know.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.708
I was gonna see who it
belonged to.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.189
You know it's not a good idea

22:45.233 --> 22:47.235
to leave those things
lying around.

22:47.278 --> 22:50.630
I know all of Sarah's friends,
you're not one of them.

22:50.673 --> 22:52.936
How could you know all of them?

22:52.980 --> 22:55.591
Oh, you mean you're like
Facebook friends with Sarah,

22:55.635 --> 22:57.898
so you don't actually know her.

22:57.941 --> 23:01.292
Do we ever actually know
the people who are in our lives?

23:02.511 --> 23:03.686
-Right.
-Mmm.

23:03.730 --> 23:04.600
Mm, excuse me.

23:09.997 --> 23:12.391
Oh hey, Marie, can't stand
your party by the way.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.393
-Hey, hey, in here, in here.
-Hi.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.091
He needs us!

23:18.397 --> 23:21.748
-Who is that?
-Who?

23:21.791 --> 23:24.272
-That, th--
-Who are you talking about?

23:24.315 --> 23:26.317
Okay, he was just,
he was just up there.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.363
-Do you not want me to
become famous?
-What?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.496
Okay, because being photographed
by Kevin is like

23:30.539 --> 23:32.846
a really huge deal, and I know
it means nothing to you

23:32.889 --> 23:35.239
because you have
like a million followers
and you're so fucking perfect--

23:35.283 --> 23:36.893
I am not always perfect--

23:36.937 --> 23:42.246
But to me, exposure to
9800 people would be huge.

23:43.334 --> 23:46.773
- Amelia, seriously?
-Pardon me, what am I
supposed to be wearing?

23:46.816 --> 23:48.688
And you're smoking a cigarette.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.603
You're so disrespectful,
you are...

24:14.975 --> 24:16.759
It really was a lovely party.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.634
I wish I didn't have to go.

24:21.677 --> 24:25.072
Oh, me too, but alas your
chariot awaits, okay.

24:25.115 --> 24:26.508
A Uber?

24:26.552 --> 24:27.596
A Lyft.

24:27.640 --> 24:28.902
Whore.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.599
Slut.

24:31.818 --> 24:33.602
Okay, okay, here we go.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.561
If I fall
down the stairs and die

24:35.604 --> 24:38.215
will you write me
a beautiful eulogy?

24:38.259 --> 24:42.959
-Oh that hurt.
Okay, and we're sitting.
-I'm English, darling.

24:43.003 --> 24:45.919
-You're no longer making
any sense. Okay.
-Yes.

24:47.181 --> 24:50.619
But am I not theater, darling?

24:51.707 --> 24:52.578
I mean really.

24:55.276 --> 24:56.146
Forgot my bag.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.540
Okay.

25:07.593 --> 25:12.032
Okay, so text me when you're
home safe in bed, okay?

25:14.251 --> 25:16.297
There's nothing safe
about my bed

25:17.472 --> 25:20.040
and never well be.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.522
Good night, Richard.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.536
Alone at last.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.667
Oh my...

25:39.625 --> 25:41.931
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

25:44.499 --> 25:45.631
I thought you left.

25:46.893 --> 25:50.418
Well, I dropped Amelia off
and came back.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.116
Why?

25:56.903 --> 25:58.557
I like being around you.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.429
I like being around you too.

26:10.307 --> 26:13.223
No, I mean, it's different.

26:14.268 --> 26:17.488
I mean, I like you.

26:22.015 --> 26:22.885
A lot.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.369
How about some water, yeah?

26:48.519 --> 26:50.609
Perfect.

27:35.741 --> 27:39.614
"Dear Marie, thank you for
letting me sleep it off

27:39.658 --> 27:41.137
on your couch last night.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.792
I'm sorry for making an ass
of myself.

27:43.836 --> 27:45.402
I hope you can forgive me.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.622
Harris."

28:12.125 --> 28:14.301
Wow, you know what,
as fun as that sounds

28:14.344 --> 28:16.869
I've actually got myself a date.

28:16.912 --> 28:21.830
You know, well, with a glass of
wine and Floyd's Moses.

28:21.874 --> 28:22.701
The Egyptian.

28:24.354 --> 28:28.010
Yeah, twice, and it gets funnier
every time I read it.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.711
Okay, well, have fun
with Umberto.

29:01.957 --> 29:05.482
Dear Marie,
while you don't know me

29:05.526 --> 29:08.659
I am writing to return what
appears to be your diary?

29:18.234 --> 29:20.846
Since I cannot be absolutely
sure it's yours

29:20.889 --> 29:23.544
I found my hope to be your
address on a piece of paper

29:23.587 --> 29:25.372
in the back of the book.

29:25.415 --> 29:27.504
Prior to returning it over to
its rightful owner

29:27.548 --> 29:30.899
I thought it best to ask you
a few pertinent questions.

29:30.943 --> 29:33.641
Please answer carefully because it could mean the difference

29:33.684 --> 29:36.383
between possession of this
repository

29:36.426 --> 29:39.212
at first some very intimate
thoughts and events

29:39.255 --> 29:40.430
that have happened

29:40.474 --> 29:42.432
over an extremely active life.

29:42.476 --> 29:45.305
Where did you meet so many
interesting people?

29:55.054 --> 29:59.145
"While I can only imagine how
disconcerting it must be

29:59.188 --> 30:03.149
to realize you have possibly
misplaced,

30:03.192 --> 30:07.849
and then to learn, in fact
you have lost such
a personal item,

30:07.893 --> 30:11.853
it would be inconceivable
for me to comprehend

30:11.897 --> 30:15.422
a situation whereby someone
other than yourself was

30:15.465 --> 30:21.123
in possession of these
innermost thoughts."

30:21.167 --> 30:24.779
-This is some creepy shit.
-Yeah, yeah, tell me about it.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.477
-Oh, who do you think wrote it?
-I have no idea.

30:27.521 --> 30:30.306
-Well, did you call the police?
-For what, a letter?

30:30.350 --> 30:33.048
I'm sure they'll have
them working in shifts.

30:33.092 --> 30:34.745
Valid.

30:34.789 --> 30:37.444
Can you do like a spell.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.185
-And reveal who took it?

30:39.228 --> 30:41.448
Sweetie, it' doesn't
really work like that.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.493
Okay, well that sucks.

30:45.974 --> 30:47.976
So what did you
say about me in it?

30:49.935 --> 30:50.805
Good things.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.241
-Really?
-Only.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.896
-Only good things.
-Yes, really only good--

30:54.940 --> 30:57.072
Can you not stress me out
right now?

30:58.291 --> 30:59.945
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.472
I am in a terrible dilemma.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.648
Being single as you are,
I risk the possibility

31:07.691 --> 31:09.998
of alienating you to the point
where nothing more

31:10.042 --> 31:12.914
than an exchange of a book will take place between us.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.222
For example, would I be better
off using this diary

31:16.265 --> 31:17.919
as a means of meeting you?

31:34.240 --> 31:35.589
What the fuck?

31:37.199 --> 31:39.941
My puppet,
you found her!

31:39.985 --> 31:43.118
-What is this?
-Do you like it?

31:43.162 --> 31:44.641
You sounded
so scared on the phone

31:44.685 --> 31:46.948
I thought I should do
something nice.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.558
She's for good things only.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.214
I'm telling you,
she may look scary

31:52.258 --> 31:55.043
but her purpose is to
protect you.

32:02.485 --> 32:04.923
Hypothetically speaking,
let's suppose

32:04.966 --> 32:08.013
I never even brought up
the subject of the diary

32:08.056 --> 32:12.017
but instead decided to
bump into you

32:12.060 --> 32:15.629
in a manner of speaking,
who would be the wiser?

32:17.326 --> 32:20.112
I could be very careful
as to my demeanor

32:20.155 --> 32:22.201
using subtlety and guile.

32:22.244 --> 32:25.682
Never letting on
what I know, but in fact

32:25.726 --> 32:28.120
we would appear to have so much in common

32:28.163 --> 32:31.950
you would marvel at
how I anticipate your needs,

32:31.993 --> 32:36.041
your desires, your fantasies.

32:37.303 --> 32:41.220
It crossed my mind
more than once, believe me.

33:03.416 --> 33:06.114
Fortunately I believe in
complete honesty.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.992
In fact being honest,
not only with others

33:14.035 --> 33:17.430
but also with oneself is
something I credit

33:17.473 --> 33:21.042
with allowing me to leave
the hospital one year earlier

33:21.086 --> 33:24.263
than even the most optimistic
doctors anticipated.

33:25.220 --> 33:28.267
But one can never be exact
about such things.

33:29.746 --> 33:33.185
Signing off for now, your angel.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.930
Ree, ree, wake up!

33:39.974 --> 33:43.064
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, are you okay?

33:43.108 --> 33:45.936
Oh no, you've killed me!

33:45.980 --> 33:47.373
Oh, does it still hurt?

33:48.939 --> 33:50.985
-Too soon?
-Too soon.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.205
Yeah, good, you deserve it.

33:53.248 --> 33:56.121
-Just tell me this, all right?
-Hmm?

33:56.164 --> 33:59.689
If you really have some sort of
psychopathic person

33:59.733 --> 34:02.214
slipping you love letters,
why on heaven and earth

34:02.257 --> 34:06.218
would you leave
your front door unlocked
whilst you're in the loo? Ow!

34:07.958 --> 34:09.003
But I did lock it.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.440
And I put the chain on.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.052
Well, then how did I get in?

34:15.922 --> 34:16.750
I have no idea.

34:18.578 --> 34:21.101
You're a ball of stress,
darling. You really
should carve out

34:21.146 --> 34:23.931
more time for relaxation
and meditation.

34:23.974 --> 34:29.589
Maybe go back to your painting.
I know.

34:29.632 --> 34:32.460
Come with me to my family villa
next weekend.

34:32.505 --> 34:37.074
-I've been dying to show you
the place for ages.
-Yeah, it sounds nice.

34:37.118 --> 34:40.252
Or I could just get you a heavy
bag for your birthday
and be done with it.

34:40.295 --> 34:43.385
-It's cheaper than
plastic surgery.
-Oh man up, you're fine.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.866
There's the girl
I love and adore.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.085
Hit it.

34:54.222 --> 34:57.356
-Hello?
- Hey, what
are you doing?

34:57.399 --> 35:00.098
-Just painting.
-Oh good, you're not
doing anything.

35:00.141 --> 35:03.231
-I need a favor.
-Okay.

35:03.275 --> 35:07.061
Kevin wants to shoot me, but
only if you do it with me too.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.324
No, I really don't wanna shoot
with Kevin again.

35:09.368 --> 35:10.934
You have to do this for me.

35:13.154 --> 35:14.547
One hour, that's it.

35:14.590 --> 35:15.896
Oh, you are an angel.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.073
Too soon?

35:19.117 --> 35:20.509
Too soon.

35:20.553 --> 35:22.903
I love you more
than life itself.

35:22.946 --> 35:23.817
Right.

35:37.004 --> 35:39.180
Ah, okay.

35:40.355 --> 35:42.270
Yeah, that's nice.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.315
Okay, hold that.

35:44.316 --> 35:45.578
Love it.

35:45.621 --> 35:46.666
Hold it, hold it.

35:46.709 --> 35:47.841
Don't try as hard.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.804
Damn Marie, that's great.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.503
Beautiful, beautiful.

35:57.546 --> 35:58.939
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold that.

35:58.982 --> 36:00.636
Oh it's great, it's great.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.595
Okay, I think we got it.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.466
Thank you so much, ladies.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.860
Oh, so when are you
going to post these?

36:06.903 --> 36:10.472
Oh yeah, I don't know, but I'll
definitely give you a heads up.

36:14.998 --> 36:17.000
Hey, Marie,
do you have a second?

36:18.741 --> 36:22.354
We got some fantastic shots
last time and I made
some prints.

36:22.397 --> 36:24.138
I'm gonna submit one and I'd
love to get your opinion

36:24.182 --> 36:25.400
on which one was your favorite.

36:25.444 --> 36:26.793
Cool, where are they?

36:28.621 --> 36:30.536
Uh, yeah, I don't
let anyone see prints

36:30.579 --> 36:32.712
until I get
the subject's approval.

36:33.974 --> 36:37.238
It'll only take a minute
if you wanna hang out.

36:37.282 --> 36:40.894
No, that's okay,
I have some glamorous plans

36:40.937 --> 36:43.636
-I must attend to, darling.
-Oh, bummer.

36:43.679 --> 36:46.160
Oh, I will see you later
at that thing.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.074
Don't be late.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.821
-Kevin, I really have to go.
-Hey, hey, hey.

36:54.864 --> 36:56.649
Look, I promise,
no funny business.

36:56.692 --> 36:59.042
I just wanna give you
some prints, okay?

37:00.914 --> 37:03.525
The prints, okay?
That's it.

37:26.287 --> 37:27.593
What is this?

37:34.991 --> 37:37.777
Do you have any idea how
beautiful you are?

37:44.827 --> 37:47.700
Oh, God damn.

38:01.757 --> 38:03.193
Change your mind?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.771
Aunt Rebecca, hi.

38:15.815 --> 38:21.951
It's your niece, Marie .

38:21.995 --> 38:25.128
Uh, it would just be
really great to see you.

38:33.963 --> 38:36.314
I am so, so sorry I'm late.

38:36.357 --> 38:39.012
I just haven't been sleeping
well lately.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.363
What's keeping you up at night?

38:42.407 --> 38:43.321
I lost my diary.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.845
Maybe that's it.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.132
I didn't know you kept a diary.

39:12.175 --> 39:13.046
Guilty.

39:14.221 --> 39:16.223
What do you write about
in your diary?

39:17.485 --> 39:18.356
Everything.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.141
Who do you think took it?

39:21.184 --> 39:22.447
I have no idea.

39:23.622 --> 39:24.927
But it's so good to see you.

39:25.798 --> 39:26.929
How are you?

39:29.018 --> 39:30.237
I'm lonely, Marie.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.109
I'm sorry I can't see you more.

39:33.153 --> 39:34.110
It's just between school and--

39:34.154 --> 39:35.373
It doesn't matter.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.990
Aunt Rebecca,
can I ask you, can--

39:46.296 --> 39:49.387
Were my father and Uncle Carl
alike in any way?

39:50.953 --> 39:54.000
Wow, we don't talk about
the past, Marie.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.610
But I'm just trying to
get sense of--

39:55.654 --> 39:57.612
A sense of what?

39:57.656 --> 40:00.920
You're trying to
find yourself, hmm?

40:00.963 --> 40:03.183
Is that why you keep a diary?

40:03.226 --> 40:04.750
I wasn't trying to upset you.

40:07.492 --> 40:09.407
You are just like your mother.

40:11.017 --> 40:11.931
Savage.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.195
Savage, what do you...

40:17.676 --> 40:19.895
She killed your father,
didn't she?

40:21.506 --> 40:23.986
You know I don't remember
what happened.

40:28.338 --> 40:31.167
I thought I could do this,
but I can't.

40:31.211 --> 40:33.039
Aunt Rebecca, I'm sorry,
I didn't--

40:33.082 --> 40:36.782
You know, there's a reason we
don't talk about the past.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.306
It stirs things up.

41:27.006 --> 41:28.529
Don't you see you need me?

41:29.704 --> 41:32.925
Without me you are just the helpless scared little girl

41:32.968 --> 41:35.928
you always feared you
would become.

41:35.971 --> 41:39.322
Fear not, for I am closer to you than you think.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.891
Now that I have your diary

41:42.935 --> 41:45.590
I understand completely
what you need

41:46.678 --> 41:48.506
and I'm going to give it to you.

41:49.594 --> 41:50.812
I had to kill Kevin.

41:51.726 --> 41:53.554
You know I did.

41:53.598 --> 41:55.948
You are no one's commodity.

41:55.991 --> 41:57.863
What do you want from me?

41:59.212 --> 42:00.648
It's the police, ma'am.

42:00.692 --> 42:02.215
Is everything all right?

42:02.258 --> 42:03.346
Everything's fine.

42:07.742 --> 42:08.613
Just a minute.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.578
-Marie Clark?
-Yeah.

42:22.496 --> 42:24.063
Do you know this man?

42:25.804 --> 42:28.894
He wanted to give me some prints
from our previous shoot.

42:28.937 --> 42:30.460
A lot of prints.

42:30.504 --> 42:33.594
You were plastered all over
his studio.

42:33.638 --> 42:36.423
Yeah, it made me uncomfortable,
so I left.

42:36.466 --> 42:37.642
With your friend Sarah.

42:37.685 --> 42:39.513
No, she left before.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.689
And what time was that exactly?

42:41.733 --> 42:44.170
I don't know, maybe 4:15,
something like that.

42:48.740 --> 42:50.393
A little jumpy, aren't we?

42:51.656 --> 42:55.224
It's just a little shocking to
hear that someone's dead.

42:55.268 --> 42:59.315
I mean, I can't pretend I liked
the guy. He's creepy as fuck.

42:59.359 --> 43:03.406
But I mean, no one,
no one deserves that.

43:04.538 --> 43:06.018
Deserves what?

43:06.061 --> 43:06.932
To be murdered.

43:08.281 --> 43:09.674
Oh, not just murdered.

43:11.023 --> 43:14.156
Kevin Duncan was assassinated
by a professional.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.637
A professional?

43:16.681 --> 43:18.160
We have reason to believe

43:18.204 --> 43:20.336
the killer has
military training.

43:22.338 --> 43:23.731
Why did you leave anyway?

43:25.646 --> 43:27.953
Were you afraid he was planning
to take advantage of you?
Assault you?

43:27.996 --> 43:30.129
I don't know what he wanted,
I just didn't wanna be there

43:30.172 --> 43:31.478
I didn't feel safe.

43:33.132 --> 43:35.656
You have a lot of
books on God.

43:35.700 --> 43:38.964
Yeah, I'm getting my masters in
comparative religion.

43:39.007 --> 43:39.878
Hmm.

43:45.710 --> 43:49.061
OCD,
I gotta touch myself.

43:49.104 --> 43:51.629
I don't want to be rude,
but it's been a pretty
intense day.

43:51.672 --> 43:55.894
Do you need anything else from
me or are we done here?

43:55.937 --> 43:58.940
This was a severely brutal
murder, Marie.

43:58.984 --> 44:01.726
Whoever did this is capable of
a level of violence

44:01.769 --> 44:04.598
most people can't
easily comprehend.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.949
So, for your own safety,

44:07.993 --> 44:10.648
I hope you're not keeping
anything from us.

44:42.592 --> 44:43.724
Hey.

44:45.421 --> 44:47.032
Axel.

44:52.428 --> 44:55.388
Hey, Axel.

44:56.998 --> 44:57.999
Axel?

45:00.480 --> 45:01.568
Okay.

45:15.538 --> 45:16.409
Stop!

45:48.484 --> 45:50.791
Hey, nice of you to show up.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.794
You might wanna try doing it at
the start of class

45:53.838 --> 45:55.448
instead of the end.

45:59.931 --> 46:01.149
What's wrong?

46:02.585 --> 46:04.762
I think I might
be losing my mind.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.855
Well, generally if you're asking
whether or not

46:10.898 --> 46:12.813
you're going crazy
it's a pretty safe bet

46:12.857 --> 46:14.075
to say you're sane.

46:15.685 --> 46:17.122
And just because you're paranoid
doesn't mean

46:17.165 --> 46:19.298
that they're all not
out to get you.

46:24.782 --> 46:25.695
I'll buy you a drink,

46:26.914 --> 46:28.133
you can tell me about
all your problems.

46:28.176 --> 46:29.047
'Kay.

46:31.049 --> 46:33.834
No, you were right to
not go to the cops.

46:33.878 --> 46:36.576
You'd only confirm
their suspicions that
you were involved somehow.

46:36.619 --> 46:40.493
Great. I mean yes, I'm glad
you agree with my instincts

46:40.536 --> 46:43.931
but I mean, if I can't go to
the cops, who can I trust?

46:46.804 --> 46:48.544
I have somebody that can help.

46:48.588 --> 46:49.719
What, like a P.I.?

46:52.331 --> 46:54.463
Yeah, you could say that.

46:59.729 --> 47:01.296
I see you're aim's improved

47:01.340 --> 47:05.170
since the last time I beat you.

47:05.213 --> 47:06.998
Have you developed amnesia?

47:07.041 --> 47:08.869
Because I remember
whooping your ass

47:08.913 --> 47:10.349
the last time we played.

47:11.350 --> 47:12.873
Put your money on the table.

47:15.920 --> 47:17.878
Money on the table.

47:17.922 --> 47:20.881
Where was that the last time
we played?

47:20.925 --> 47:22.056
Abu Dhabi.

47:22.100 --> 47:23.101
Ooh!

47:23.144 --> 47:24.711
The weapons convention.

47:24.754 --> 47:25.799
Yup.

47:27.322 --> 47:29.629
The time Keith
almost blew our cover.

47:30.586 --> 47:32.110
That's the one.

47:32.153 --> 47:33.720
Fucker still owes us
for that one.

47:33.763 --> 47:35.678
He's this close to being'
strung up by his balls

47:35.722 --> 47:37.724
for the rest of his life.

47:37.767 --> 47:38.856
Where's he at now?

47:40.945 --> 47:41.859
The agency.

47:44.557 --> 47:45.645
That figures.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.476
Speaking of owing favors.

47:51.564 --> 47:53.696
Oh yeah, what's her name again?

47:53.740 --> 47:54.872
Marie.

47:54.915 --> 47:56.221
Marie Clark.

47:56.264 --> 47:57.135
Marie Clark.

48:01.052 --> 48:02.923
Hey brother, are you all right?

48:02.967 --> 48:04.359
Don't I look all right?

48:08.494 --> 48:09.930
This girl I told you about,

48:09.974 --> 48:11.497
the girl I told you that needs
your help?

48:11.540 --> 48:12.411
She's special.

48:14.979 --> 48:16.981
So if you're not up for this...

48:17.024 --> 48:19.374
Catching a stalker, that's easy.

48:19.418 --> 48:22.595
-They always come to you.
-Angus, that's not
what I'm talking about.

48:22.638 --> 48:26.729
I owe you one. I told you I'd
take care of the young student.

48:26.773 --> 48:29.645
It's not like that. She's in
a fragile place right now.

48:29.689 --> 48:31.473
Now I don't need you
going up there

48:31.517 --> 48:34.041
at 11:30 AM smelling like
whiskey, you feel me?

48:34.085 --> 48:36.957
Do you really have to insult me?

48:37.001 --> 48:39.655
Implying that I'd stoop so low

48:40.613 --> 48:44.834
as to meet a new client for
the first time, drunk?

48:48.751 --> 48:50.536
I'm a fucking professional.

49:06.552 --> 49:09.685
There we go, okay.

49:09.729 --> 49:12.732
I'm not gonna sugar
coat it for you, woman.

49:12.775 --> 49:14.560
I've seen things that'd turn

49:14.603 --> 49:16.562
another man's nuts into raisins.

49:16.605 --> 49:18.085
Oh, okay.

49:18.129 --> 49:20.000
I'm midway through
a vicious divorce

49:20.044 --> 49:22.481
and I'm taking down
a liter of Jameson a night.

49:22.524 --> 49:26.485
My company is in serious danger
of going down the shitter.

49:26.528 --> 49:30.663
'Cause I was having an affair

49:30.706 --> 49:32.708
with my 22-year-old assistant.

49:34.014 --> 49:37.496
-And my wife caught us on tape.
-Wow.

49:37.539 --> 49:40.151
But I'm really good at
what I do.

49:40.194 --> 49:42.196
I can solve your problem
for you.

49:48.028 --> 49:51.292
Oh, I see you've already K.O.'d
the security cameras.

49:53.512 --> 49:55.253
Strong Solutions, wow.

49:55.296 --> 49:57.559
That's quite a name
for your company.

49:57.603 --> 49:59.561
-Do you like it?
-Oh yeah, I do, no it's,

49:59.605 --> 50:01.085
it gives the impression

50:01.128 --> 50:03.043
that you have strong solutions

50:04.044 --> 50:06.699
for people's problems.

50:06.742 --> 50:09.745
Yes love, that we do.

50:12.574 --> 50:14.924
Okay, yeah, so,
how does this work?

50:14.968 --> 50:17.492
You know, what do we do first?

50:20.582 --> 50:23.107
First we find out how this
person's been getting

50:23.150 --> 50:24.978
in and out of your apartment.

50:32.029 --> 50:33.204
Perfect.

50:36.250 --> 50:39.775
Yeah, you definitely wanna have
these locks changed.

50:39.819 --> 50:43.475
But there's no sign of forced
entry in the apartment.

50:43.518 --> 50:45.694
Whoever's coming in here
has a key.

50:45.738 --> 50:47.261
Yeah, but I put the chain on it.

50:47.305 --> 50:48.958
Chains can be opened from
the outside

50:49.002 --> 50:51.265
with a rubber band
and a piece of tape.

50:51.309 --> 50:53.441
Pop this under the door when
you're here alone.

50:53.485 --> 50:55.095
It will not keep an intruder
out forever

50:55.139 --> 50:56.836
but it'll slow him down
long enough

50:56.879 --> 50:59.708
for you to get a suitable
weapon. Do you have a gun?

50:59.752 --> 51:02.537
-No, God, no, no.
-Well, you should get
yourself one.

51:02.581 --> 51:05.410
Or at least a decent
canister of pepper spray.

51:05.453 --> 51:07.977
And I'm gonna need a list of
everyone in your life

51:08.021 --> 51:10.110
who could've taken your diary.

51:10.154 --> 51:14.810
The good, the bad,
and everyone in between.

51:18.249 --> 51:21.991
Okay, this is the list of
their names.

51:22.035 --> 51:25.343
-If you need anything--
-Oh, names are enough.

51:25.386 --> 51:27.084
You did it alphabetically.

51:28.998 --> 51:31.218
Yeah, that's just how my mind
works I guess.

51:31.262 --> 51:32.132
Impressive.

51:33.916 --> 51:35.440
So what do we do now?

51:35.483 --> 51:37.659
Now I find out
who's been stalking you

51:37.703 --> 51:39.487
and I'm gonna make them stop.

52:00.291 --> 52:01.161
What?

52:02.162 --> 52:03.337
Robert D'Angelino!

52:05.992 --> 52:09.082
Never heard of him.

52:09.126 --> 52:11.215
I'm here to talk to you
about a murder.

52:22.878 --> 52:23.749
Who died?

52:23.792 --> 52:25.054
Kevin Duncan.

52:25.098 --> 52:26.969
Never heard of him either.

52:27.013 --> 52:28.580
You sure about that?

52:28.623 --> 52:30.234
'Cause your ex-girlfriend was
the last person

52:30.277 --> 52:31.322
to see him alive.

52:37.415 --> 52:38.546
So what are you saying?

52:38.590 --> 52:39.547
Marie killed him?

52:39.591 --> 52:40.896
Maybe you killed him.

52:41.984 --> 52:43.464
Oh, I see.

52:43.508 --> 52:44.726
You fell for it too.

52:46.163 --> 52:47.033
Fell for what?

52:49.078 --> 52:51.516
She plays it all cute and sweet

52:51.559 --> 52:53.387
but that's not who she
really is.

52:56.129 --> 52:57.391
Oh no?

53:00.786 --> 53:01.656
Who is she then?

53:03.441 --> 53:05.747
You don't know shit,
get the fuck out of my--

53:05.791 --> 53:09.751
Stay the fuck away from her,
do you hear me? Hmm,
do you hear me?

53:09.795 --> 53:14.234
Because if you come within
a mile of Marie Clark ever again
I'll be coming back.

53:14.278 --> 53:16.541
And if I have to come back,
we're not gonna have

53:16.584 --> 53:18.107
as nice a chat
as we're having now.

53:21.894 --> 53:24.940
Now you boys make sure to enjoy
the rest of your day.

53:25.985 --> 53:28.117
Life can be shorter than
you think.

53:30.946 --> 53:33.340
Eight years of marriage,
and she leaves

53:33.384 --> 53:36.822
without a word, a note, nothing.

53:37.736 --> 53:39.346
It's like she just vanished.

53:39.390 --> 53:40.391
I'm so sorry.

53:41.783 --> 53:43.611
Maybe she got bored.

53:43.655 --> 53:45.439
I mean, how many times can you
hear a guy get drunk

53:45.483 --> 53:50.270
and rant about Amakelites before
the novelty wears off.

53:50.314 --> 53:53.578
-Amalekites.
-Amalekites.

53:53.621 --> 53:56.450
Well, I could listen to you rant
about Abimelech

53:56.494 --> 54:00.237
and the Amelekites until David
brings 200 foreskins to Saul.

54:01.673 --> 54:04.241
Dear God. You are perfect.

54:05.242 --> 54:06.939
-Stop.
-Seriously.

54:08.201 --> 54:09.594
You quote Maimonides.

54:11.117 --> 54:14.642
You have a million followers on
that social media thing.

54:14.686 --> 54:17.645
You're kind, you're sweet,
you're funny.

54:18.733 --> 54:20.169
Beautiful beyond words.

54:21.693 --> 54:23.608
And you're fucking brilliant.

54:23.651 --> 54:25.784
You're gonna make
a major contribution

54:25.827 --> 54:28.177
with your research in Enuma.

54:28.221 --> 54:29.048
So what gives?

54:30.702 --> 54:32.617
You must have
a defect somewhere.

54:33.705 --> 54:36.969
I just can't for the life of me
figure out what it is.

54:37.012 --> 54:38.405
Well, I do have a stalker.

54:39.537 --> 54:40.494
There's that.

54:40.538 --> 54:41.365
Yeah.

54:42.670 --> 54:45.543
How are things working out
with Angus?

54:45.586 --> 54:47.632
Yeah, how do you
know him exactly?

54:49.155 --> 54:52.158
We served together
in a private company.

54:52.201 --> 54:54.639
What, like mercenaries?

54:56.771 --> 55:00.601
Something like that.
It's best to keep it vague.

55:00.645 --> 55:03.909
You know, what important is that
you can trust him to look out
for your best interest.

55:03.952 --> 55:06.825
-Are you sure about that?
-Do you really think
I would bring someone

55:06.868 --> 55:11.786
-in your life you can't trust?
-And what about you, huh?

55:11.830 --> 55:15.268
Like all the sudden you're some
G.I. Joe mercenary assassin?

55:15.312 --> 55:17.488
I collected intel
when I was active.

55:19.620 --> 55:23.885
They had other people do
the killing.

55:26.018 --> 55:28.542
I just did it to pay for school.

55:28.586 --> 55:30.370
I'm retired from that life now.

55:31.415 --> 55:32.938
Hey, this is my life now.

55:38.813 --> 55:41.076
First temple split
heaven and earth.

55:42.295 --> 55:44.079
Watery shrine built for
a prince.

55:44.993 --> 55:46.691
Water poured from his
pure canal.

55:46.734 --> 55:48.649
Oh my God, wow.

55:48.693 --> 55:52.044
I can't believe you got
the university to acquire this.

55:52.087 --> 55:55.264
It must have cost a fortune.

55:56.353 --> 55:58.877
Well, when I saw it
it was going up for auction

55:58.920 --> 56:01.923
I told the dean I'd quit if they
didn't acquire it.

56:03.011 --> 56:05.797
You were ready to quit your job
over this? Why?

56:07.538 --> 56:09.931
Well, I knew
it would make you happy.

56:11.019 --> 56:11.890
Really?

56:14.762 --> 56:15.633
Really.

56:45.489 --> 56:48.187
Why are you here,
Mr. McGlocklin?

56:48.230 --> 56:51.364
Between you and me
I'm just padding my books.

56:52.321 --> 56:53.932
It looks good to
the client when we meet

56:53.975 --> 56:56.151
with all potentially
relevant people in person.

56:56.195 --> 56:58.632
I don't have an objective here

56:58.676 --> 57:01.156
but since I am here,
anything you can tell me

57:01.200 --> 57:04.203
about who might be
stalking her, could be helpful.

57:05.639 --> 57:07.511
Does Marie have any enemies?

57:07.554 --> 57:09.426
Every beautiful girl
has enemies.

57:09.469 --> 57:11.819
But does she have
enemies capable of murder?

57:11.863 --> 57:14.300
Given the right
circumstance just about anyone,

57:14.343 --> 57:16.781
I think, is capable of murder.

57:16.824 --> 57:19.523
Isn't that
your experience, sergeant?

57:19.566 --> 57:22.047
Oh, retired now.

57:22.090 --> 57:25.659
Oh, really? So why
did you leave the Army?

57:25.703 --> 57:27.835
Oh, that's
a long and boring story.

57:27.879 --> 57:29.707
You know, I really like the way

57:29.750 --> 57:31.404
you've decorated your office.

57:31.448 --> 57:32.797
Well, thank you.

57:32.840 --> 57:34.712
Did you do it
yourself or hire someone?

57:34.755 --> 57:36.583
What do they call them?

57:36.627 --> 57:38.324
Interior designers.

57:38.367 --> 57:40.674
Why, are you
looking for someone?

57:40.718 --> 57:43.634
Oh, I don't think
I could afford them.

57:43.677 --> 57:46.114
You must have
a very successful practice.

57:46.158 --> 57:50.031
Ah, yes, well I do well enough.

57:53.426 --> 57:56.603
What's your hourly rate,
if you don't mind me asking?

57:57.735 --> 57:59.519
My clients pay me by the month

57:59.563 --> 58:02.435
and get whatever
time they need from me.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.655
How does Marie pay you for that?

58:04.698 --> 58:07.179
I mean, I'm doing
a favor for a buddy

58:07.222 --> 58:09.355
'cause she made it clear
she couldn't afford my rates.

58:09.398 --> 58:12.750
I wanna make sure she's not
taking me for a run, you know?

58:12.793 --> 58:16.362
Mistaking my generosity
for stupidity and whatnot.

58:16.405 --> 58:21.541
Mr. McGlocklin, Marie survived
a very traumatic childhood

58:21.585 --> 58:25.589
and has worked incredibly hard
to get where she is today.

58:25.632 --> 58:27.460
And where is she today?

58:27.504 --> 58:30.724
Able to function as a normal,
successful human being,

58:30.768 --> 58:32.639
and with a very bright future.

58:32.683 --> 58:34.989
The fact that she is
not completely immobilized

58:35.033 --> 58:37.078
by the trauma
that she went through,

58:37.122 --> 58:40.342
that's nothing short of
a miracle, Mr. McGlocklin.

58:40.386 --> 58:43.389
-I didn't know.
-Yes, well, know this.

58:43.432 --> 58:48.002
I care deeply for Marie,
as I do all of my patients.

58:48.046 --> 58:52.572
I tell you, I do not appreciate
a character such as yourself

58:52.616 --> 58:57.490
nosing about her business in
your cavalier military fashion.

58:57.534 --> 59:00.624
So if you will excuse me,
I think we're done here.

59:20.687 --> 59:22.994
Oh, hold the door. Thank you.

59:36.007 --> 59:39.663
Don't tell anyone
where you're going.

59:39.706 --> 59:41.752
Don't bring any
devices with you.

59:43.536 --> 59:45.538
I'll control your social media.

59:47.671 --> 59:51.109
And within 48 hours, I'm gonna have whoever did this

59:51.152 --> 59:52.937
nailed to the fucking wall.

Told you I was a trust fund kid.

01:01:33.124 --> 01:01:35.735
That's Tres,
he's the groundskeeper.

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:38.216
He looks after
the place when we're not here

01:01:38.259 --> 01:01:40.392
which is most of the time.

01:01:40.435 --> 01:01:43.787
So it's a pretty
good deal for him actually.

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:45.614
He's staying with us?

01:01:45.658 --> 01:01:48.095
Only in the shed, darling.
Don't let the help in the house.

01:01:48.139 --> 01:01:51.751
-So he doesn't have keys?
-He's perfectly harmless.

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:54.449
Don't be fooled by
his appearance,
he's an absolute sweetheart.

01:01:54.493 --> 01:01:56.451
-He's kind of like you
in his one way.
-Oh that is unfortunate.

01:01:56.495 --> 01:01:57.757
Good to see you, Mr. Richard.

01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:58.671
Hello.

01:02:00.194 --> 01:02:02.849
The house is in
perfect working order,

01:02:02.893 --> 01:02:05.765
I turned off the security
system like you asked

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:09.116
so we won't have no problem
with the police like last time.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.639
Thank you.

01:02:10.683 --> 01:02:14.556
Tres, this is
my dear friend, Marie.

01:02:15.557 --> 01:02:17.516
Marie, this is Tres.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.345
Glad to know you, Miss Marie.

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:26.394
Wait until I show you the view.

01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:30.137
Tres, darling, would you
put the luggage away please.

01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:31.965
Happy to, Mr. Richard.

01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:33.314
Thank you.

01:02:33.358 --> 01:02:35.447
Is the bar fully stocked?

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:37.928
Well, I knew it was you coming

01:02:37.971 --> 01:02:41.366
so I'm gonna let you answer
that one for yourself.

01:02:41.409 --> 01:02:46.066
-Tres, you are a godsend.
-We do what we can, Mr.
Richard. We do what we can.

01:03:47.998 --> 01:03:49.129
Keep your hands where I
can see 'em

01:03:49.173 --> 01:03:50.957
and move over to the corner.

01:03:54.526 --> 01:03:59.836
-Who sent you?
-That's an impressive piece
of machinery you have there.

01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:03.056
You tell that piece of shit
I've done everything he asked,

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:04.928
all right, he ain't got
any reason to be doing' this.

01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:07.278
What is it you think
I'm here to do?

01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:11.325
-Motherfucker.
-I'm not here for
the reasons you think I'm here.

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:12.587
Down on your knees.

01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:14.328
-That's not gonna happen.
-What?

01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:16.330
I'm not getting down on my knees

01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:17.897
and you're not gonna shoot me.

01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:19.986
-Oh, you don't think so?
-No.

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:23.772
-You're not a killer.
-You don't know.

01:04:23.816 --> 01:04:28.516
Huh, I know that you were
the smartest kid in your class.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.867
And you had a natural
ability for programming.

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:33.870
But you had social
anxieties too, and secretly felt

01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:36.655
that the other little fuckers
were always laughing at you.

01:04:36.698 --> 01:04:38.875
Which, they were.

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.748
Put down the gun, son.
I'm only here to talk.

01:04:49.711 --> 01:04:51.409
Why are you
monitoring Marie Clark?

01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:52.497
I don't know what--

01:04:54.455 --> 01:04:55.979
My time's run out.

01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:57.806
So if you don't
start giving me answers

01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:59.939
I'm gonna blow that
pretty little head of yours

01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:01.419
all over that X there,
do you hear me?

01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:02.942
I'm telling you, man.
I don't know shit,

01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:04.204
they don't tell me shit, okay?

01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:07.599
Oh, they, hmm?

01:05:07.642 --> 01:05:09.427
They is a start.

01:05:13.039 --> 01:05:16.738
Who's they?
Hmm?

01:05:19.176 --> 01:05:20.612
No?

01:05:20.655 --> 01:05:22.483
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, okay, listen.

01:05:22.527 --> 01:05:24.311
All right, okay I met a guy
at the party

01:05:24.355 --> 01:05:26.792
-and he offered me
a lot of dough.
-Huh.

01:05:26.835 --> 01:05:29.621
And he set me up as
her boyfriend's roommate

01:05:29.664 --> 01:05:30.970
when she moved out
to monitor her.

01:05:31.014 --> 01:05:32.580
Okay, so I hacked into her shit.

01:05:32.624 --> 01:05:34.321
-To do what?
-Just to fuck with her.

01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:35.888
To fuck with her how?

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.934
Just to fuck with
her head and stuff like,

01:05:37.977 --> 01:05:43.678
-make her paranoid,
like she's going crazy.
-Who was the guy?

01:05:43.722 --> 01:05:46.159
I don't know, he paid me cash.
I never heard from him again.

01:05:46.203 --> 01:05:48.770
Well, if he paid you up front
and you never saw
the guy again

01:05:48.814 --> 01:05:49.902
why didn't you just
pocket the money

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:51.991
and leave the poor girl alone?

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:53.123
'Cause this isn't the kinda
guy you wanna piss off.

01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:54.385
What do you mean?

01:05:55.473 --> 01:05:57.649
He's like, evil, okay?

01:05:57.692 --> 01:06:00.173
He's like into
some real dark shit.

01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:08.790
Here are your quarters.

01:06:14.448 --> 01:06:16.059
It's a bit musky.

01:06:29.507 --> 01:06:32.597
Grandmother had
an obsession with dolls.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.512
This is just
the tip of the iceberg.

01:06:34.555 --> 01:06:36.209
You should see the attic.

01:06:36.253 --> 01:06:38.690
Creepy dolls, perfect.

01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:41.258
Well, there's no point
hiding it from you.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.696
They can walk and talk.

01:06:46.654 --> 01:06:48.178
-And then they have--
-Okay, okay,

01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:50.832
you really are insane,
you know this, right?

01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:57.839
You know, one time I found
a particularly randy Annalee
doll on top of one of my Kens.

01:06:57.883 --> 01:07:02.757
Knickers over her head.
We should really just throw them
in a bin and be done with it.

01:07:02.801 --> 01:07:04.498
But since it would
break mother's heart

01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:07.240
to do such a cruel
and heartless thing...

01:07:25.084 --> 01:07:27.304
There, that does it.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:32.874
I could find you another room.

01:07:32.918 --> 01:07:38.054
Oh no, no.
Richard this is wonderful.

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:38.967
Thank you.

01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:40.056
Come, come.

01:07:41.709 --> 01:07:42.580
None of that.

01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:44.799
We're on holiday.

01:07:47.193 --> 01:07:49.369
You don't need to get
all emotional and, you know,

01:07:49.413 --> 01:07:51.632
take time away from
more important things.

01:07:51.676 --> 01:07:55.027
Like getting properly legless.

01:07:56.942 --> 01:07:58.813
How 'bout
a nice couple of Pimm's?

01:07:58.857 --> 01:08:00.772
Sounds lovely, doesn't it?

01:08:00.815 --> 01:08:02.426
Yeah, lovely.

01:08:09.259 --> 01:08:12.175
You took custody of
your niece when she was how old?

01:08:12.218 --> 01:08:16.787
Fifteen, she was fifteen
when my brother died.

01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:18.572
How long was it then

01:08:18.616 --> 01:08:21.140
before you checked
her into the hospital?

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:25.144
How do you know about that?

01:08:25.188 --> 01:08:27.145
All due respect, it's my job

01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:28.886
to know everything about Marie.

01:08:30.453 --> 01:08:32.151
What else do you think you know?

01:08:34.501 --> 01:08:36.372
What else are you afraid I know?

01:08:40.506 --> 01:08:42.553
I think I'd like
you to leave now.

01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:44.337
Rebecca, I want
you to look at me.

01:08:44.381 --> 01:08:48.124
You've been carrying an immense
weight on your shoulders.

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:50.343
And I can remove
that weight for you.

01:08:55.522 --> 01:08:56.654
I want you to understand that

01:08:56.697 --> 01:08:58.872
what happened isn't your fault.

01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:01.658
You were just doing
what you felt you had to do.

01:09:01.702 --> 01:09:02.834
Yes.

01:09:02.877 --> 01:09:04.488
Can you trust me, Rebecca?

01:09:09.014 --> 01:09:11.886
Now talk me
through the order of events

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:14.671
until the day you
put her in the hospital.

01:09:24.029 --> 01:09:26.336
We're here.

01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:31.602
Darling, this is
your Uncle Carl.

01:09:31.645 --> 01:09:34.779
-Carl, this is Marie.
-Hi.

01:09:41.524 --> 01:09:42.395
I'll grab this.

01:09:56.453 --> 01:09:58.498
Carl, Carl!

01:09:58.542 --> 01:09:59.717
Carl?

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.806
Carl? Carl!

01:10:01.849 --> 01:10:04.069
My mom sent me
an angel to protect me.

01:10:05.418 --> 01:10:08.465
Marie, what happened here?

01:10:08.508 --> 01:10:10.597
It was my angel.

01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:11.511
She did it.

01:10:16.299 --> 01:10:20.564
Hello, we're here
to see Dr. Kellogg.

01:10:24.176 --> 01:10:27.440
Remember, we don't
talk about the past.

01:10:30.965 --> 01:10:31.836
To anyone.

01:10:34.534 --> 01:10:37.233
Oh, don't look so scared, Marie,

01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:39.539
this place is not
as bad as all that.

01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:41.933
Now let me show you
to your new bedroom.

01:10:55.555 --> 01:10:56.426
It's all right.

01:11:02.519 --> 01:11:07.567
-Hello there, Rosemary.
-Can I help you?

01:11:07.611 --> 01:11:10.440
That's very pretty pin
you have on there.

01:11:10.483 --> 01:11:11.354
Thank you.

01:11:12.398 --> 01:11:14.182
Did you make it yourself?

01:11:14.226 --> 01:11:16.489
Why yes, I actually did.

01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:20.754
I thought so, it has
that one of a kind feel to it.

01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:23.975
Well, how can I help you?

01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:26.630
Well, I was hoping you
could let me take a look

01:11:26.673 --> 01:11:28.675
at a file for a former patient.

01:11:38.555 --> 01:11:40.513
So Marie had
two primary doctors,

01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:44.038
first Kellogg, then Brighton?

01:11:44.082 --> 01:11:45.388
Yes, that's correct.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.912
Is Dr. Kellogg still here?

01:11:50.088 --> 01:11:51.611
Dr. Kellogg was murdered

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.919
in the parking lot
two weeks ago.

01:11:57.138 --> 01:11:58.618
He was stabbed to death.

01:12:03.057 --> 01:12:07.148
-It looks like your client was
part of a program called Alter.
-Alter?

01:12:07.192 --> 01:12:10.630
Alter was part of a post-911
experimental project blitz.

01:12:10.674 --> 01:12:12.284
When they were
giving the green light

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:13.416
to just about anything.

01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:15.287
What can you tell me about it?

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.855
It was started by
an outside contractor.

01:12:17.898 --> 01:12:21.946
It was a program for
developing unwitting assassins.

01:12:21.989 --> 01:12:23.513
Why was it abandoned?

01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:25.384
They found out he was
using a mental patient

01:12:25.428 --> 01:12:27.386
as a test subject.

01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:29.214
Shut it down quick.

01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:30.215
Hmm.

01:12:30.258 --> 01:12:31.303
That's all I got.

01:12:33.087 --> 01:12:36.308
I know what you're risking
by giving me this, Keith.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.528
Don't think it
goes unappreciated.

01:12:39.833 --> 01:12:43.228
Well, you find this motherfucker
that did this to Harris

01:12:43.271 --> 01:12:45.970
and you do to him
what I wish I could.

01:12:53.673 --> 01:12:56.894
You sleep all right
last night, Miss Marie?

01:12:56.937 --> 01:12:58.939
I did, thank you.

01:13:00.593 --> 01:13:02.813
You ain't from
around here, are you?

01:13:04.945 --> 01:13:07.992
No, I'm not. I mean, yeah,
no, not originally.

01:13:08.035 --> 01:13:09.472
That's like me.

01:13:09.515 --> 01:13:12.126
I ain't from around here
originally neither.

01:13:13.954 --> 01:13:18.002
But you ain't an open
gate motherfucker, are you?

01:13:18.045 --> 01:13:18.916
Excuse me?

01:13:20.439 --> 01:13:22.354
It's just there's three
kinds of people in this world.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.443
You got your open gate
motherfuckers,

01:13:24.487 --> 01:13:26.489
your closed gate motherfuckers,

01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:29.317
and your locked gate
motherfuckers.

01:13:29.361 --> 01:13:32.538
Now what's your open gate
motherfucker saying?

01:13:32.582 --> 01:13:36.586
-I don't know.
-Well, he's saying,
"My gate is open.

01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:39.502
What's mine is yours,
you can come take my shit."

01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:43.462
And if you're foolish enough
to leave your gate open

01:13:43.506 --> 01:13:45.638
I'm gonna take your shit.

01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:48.598
But then you got
your locked gate motherfucker.

01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:50.774
Now what they saying'...

01:13:52.819 --> 01:13:55.953
They saying',
"My shit is valuable.

01:13:57.084 --> 01:13:59.304
I don't want you
to take my shit."

01:14:00.348 --> 01:14:02.481
But if you think
some little ol' rinky dink

01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:04.091
motherfuckin' lock
gonna keep me out

01:14:04.135 --> 01:14:06.442
I'm definitely gonna
take your shit.

01:14:09.009 --> 01:14:13.231
And finally you got
your closed gate motherfuckers.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.277
Now what they saying',

01:14:16.321 --> 01:14:18.845
what they saying' is,
"My shit is valuable.

01:14:20.194 --> 01:14:22.849
I don't want you to take it."

01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:26.723
But I don't need no
mother fuckin' rinky dink lock

01:14:26.766 --> 01:14:28.725
to keep you out, no.

01:14:28.768 --> 01:14:31.075
You ain't gonna touch my shit

01:14:31.118 --> 01:14:33.512
'cause you know I'm
such a bad motherfucker."

01:14:39.562 --> 01:14:42.739
So, the moral of the story is?

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:47.657
Always be
a closed gate motherfucker?

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.746
Closed gate motherfucker.

01:14:49.789 --> 01:14:51.574
I'll keep that in mind, thanks.

01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:54.533
Now you have yourself
a nice run now, Miss Marie.

01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:58.668
I appreciate you
taking the time to see me again.

01:14:58.711 --> 01:15:03.499
Well, I must say I was curious
when you contacted me again.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.370
Thank you.

01:15:11.202 --> 01:15:14.814
-Hot!
-Now, you said you
needed my expert opinion

01:15:14.858 --> 01:15:16.903
on a different case
that you're working on?

01:15:16.947 --> 01:15:20.559
A runaway,
her parents are terrified
'cause the daughter suffers

01:15:20.603 --> 01:15:23.040
from multiple
personality disorder.

01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:25.608
Trying to get a good sense
of what life's like

01:15:25.651 --> 01:15:27.305
for someone with this disorder

01:15:27.348 --> 01:15:29.699
so I can figure out
where to begin.

01:15:29.742 --> 01:15:31.222
Do you think you can help me?

01:15:31.265 --> 01:15:33.398
Well, the disorder
you're referring to is

01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:37.402
dissociative identity
disorder, which just happens

01:15:37.445 --> 01:15:38.925
to be my specialty.

01:15:38.969 --> 01:15:41.058
I think you know that.

01:15:41.101 --> 01:15:43.060
That's why I came to you first.

01:15:43.103 --> 01:15:44.540
Always start with the best.

01:15:45.628 --> 01:15:48.326
So what would you like to know?

01:15:48.369 --> 01:15:51.242
Well, is it like
it is in the movies?

01:15:51.285 --> 01:15:53.157
With one personality
being normal

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.291
and the other
a brutal psychopath?

01:15:57.335 --> 01:15:58.858
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:15:58.902 --> 01:16:00.164
How so?

01:16:00.207 --> 01:16:01.948
Well, it doesn't
make it any easier

01:16:01.992 --> 01:16:03.602
on the DID community that

01:16:03.646 --> 01:16:05.909
movies only portray them

01:16:05.952 --> 01:16:07.606
as monsters

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:11.479
whose alters commit
these violent, evil deeds.

01:16:11.523 --> 01:16:14.700
I'm sorry, what
did you say, alters?

01:16:14.744 --> 01:16:17.268
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:16:17.311 --> 01:16:21.315
We refer to the dominant
identity as the host.

01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:24.667
And all the other identities,
the ones the patients creates

01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:27.408
to protect themselves
from whatever trauma

01:16:27.452 --> 01:16:28.845
that they went through

01:16:29.976 --> 01:16:32.892
those are called alters.

01:16:32.936 --> 01:16:35.503
What type of trauma?

01:16:35.547 --> 01:16:37.288
Childhood trauma.

01:16:41.509 --> 01:16:43.599
The worst part is I knew.

01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:48.212
I knew the whole time, and
I convinced myself I was crazy.

01:16:49.692 --> 01:16:51.737
You convinced me I was crazy.

01:16:51.781 --> 01:16:53.173
You sick gaslighting fuck.

01:16:54.697 --> 01:16:55.785
You're out of your mind.

01:16:55.828 --> 01:16:59.223
She told me Larry, she told me.

01:16:59.266 --> 01:17:00.746
She's a child.

01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:04.358
A child with an active
imagination, that's all.

01:17:04.402 --> 01:17:06.622
I let this happen.

01:17:08.188 --> 01:17:11.452
Please God, send me an angel.

01:17:11.496 --> 01:17:13.454
-An angel to protect me always.

01:17:13.498 --> 01:17:14.673
Here you go again.

01:17:16.022 --> 01:17:18.372
All the times that,
you know, she fell down,

01:17:18.416 --> 01:17:19.678
all the times that
she had the bruises.

01:17:19.722 --> 01:17:21.027
You need to calm down,

01:17:21.071 --> 01:17:22.812
you're gonna give
yourself a seizure.

01:17:22.855 --> 01:17:24.291
You hurt her!

01:17:24.335 --> 01:17:25.336
You hurt her!

01:17:25.379 --> 01:17:28.687
You hurt her!

01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:29.819
I hate you!

01:17:44.529 --> 01:17:47.314
Please God, send me an angel.

01:17:47.358 --> 01:17:49.577
An angel who will protect me.

01:17:49.621 --> 01:17:53.669
Please God, send me an angel.

01:17:53.712 --> 01:17:55.714
You've been a bad girl, Marie.

01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:55.426
Oh baby, I'm sorry.

01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:55.094
Just let the past
live where it belongs.

01:19:57.749 --> 01:20:00.186
You deserve to be happy.

01:20:04.538 --> 01:20:07.280
You know there's a reason
we don't talk about the past.

01:20:07.324 --> 01:20:08.804
Stirs things up.

01:20:13.634 --> 01:20:14.505
Hi.

01:20:17.203 --> 01:20:19.162
You don't remember me, do you?

01:20:19.205 --> 01:20:20.685
How wasted were you?

01:20:47.538 --> 01:20:50.628
Come on, fix me a drink, Angel.

01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:18.134
♪ Angel, angel, come to me

01:21:20.092 --> 01:21:24.967
♪ Angel, angel, set me free

01:21:26.664 --> 01:21:31.799
♪ I need you and you need me

01:21:33.627 --> 01:21:37.501
♪ My angel for

01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:41.940
♪ eternity

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:46.814
That's my angel.

01:21:57.564 --> 01:22:00.306
The child manifests
an alter to endure the pain

01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:03.570
that's been inflicted on them
so they can survive it.

01:22:03.614 --> 01:22:06.138
So they can pretend that
it's happening to someone else

01:22:06.182 --> 01:22:08.880
or there's someone else there
to protect them.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:12.318
And so the violence
makes them violent.

01:22:12.362 --> 01:22:15.191
No, no, no, no, the vast
majority of those afflicted

01:22:15.234 --> 01:22:20.457
with DID do not have alters
who commit violent acts.

01:22:21.327 --> 01:22:25.244
But they are still,
all of them, they are beholden

01:22:25.288 --> 01:22:29.335
to the same basic
tenets as the host.

01:22:29.379 --> 01:22:31.555
So could someone
hypnotize an alter

01:22:31.598 --> 01:22:33.644
without the host
being aware of it?

01:22:33.687 --> 01:22:35.820
-Control that alter?

01:22:35.863 --> 01:22:40.738
Well, they would have to
be an exceptional hypnotist.

01:22:40.781 --> 01:22:44.872
-Could you do it?
-Why would I want to?

01:22:45.786 --> 01:22:51.923
-I don't know,
why did you do it to Marie?
-I beg your pardon?

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:54.534
Was it to get a government
contract to fund your work?

01:22:54.578 --> 01:22:57.798
In exchange for creating the
most lethal kind of assassin?

01:23:01.193 --> 01:23:02.934
What kind of assassin is that?

01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:05.458
The unknowing kind.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:10.724
You're the one who's
been terrorizing Marie

01:23:10.768 --> 01:23:15.381
trying to drive her crazy so
you can pin the murders on her.

01:23:17.514 --> 01:23:20.212
How many people
have you made her kill?

01:23:20.256 --> 01:23:22.562
Well, I really can't recall.

01:23:22.606 --> 01:23:24.651
Yeah well,
you don't know this yet

01:23:24.695 --> 01:23:27.915
but you really fucked up...

01:23:27.959 --> 01:23:31.267
-Ah.
-...when you murdered my friend.

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:33.399
Oh, I did?

01:23:35.706 --> 01:23:36.576
Oh .

01:23:45.846 --> 01:23:48.936
But now you see,
your friend Harris,

01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:52.723
he just simply got in the way.

01:23:52.766 --> 01:23:56.074
I mean he encouraged her
to ask the wrong questions

01:23:56.118 --> 01:23:59.251
and he introduced her to you.

01:24:04.517 --> 01:24:07.564
Tell me,
how does it feel to know that

01:24:08.826 --> 01:24:11.176
you're the reason
that your friend is dead?

01:24:41.989 --> 01:24:42.860
No.

01:24:44.775 --> 01:24:45.645
You're ready.

01:24:48.996 --> 01:24:54.350
♪ Angel, Angel come to me

01:24:55.220 --> 01:25:00.530
♪ Angel, Angel set me free

01:25:03.272 --> 01:25:08.755
♪ I need you and you need me

01:25:08.799 --> 01:25:12.281
♪ My angel for

01:25:12.324 --> 01:25:15.458
♪ eternity

01:25:36.043 --> 01:25:38.437
When are you going
to give it back to her?

01:25:40.396 --> 01:25:42.354
You said it would be
helpful to read her diary

01:25:42.398 --> 01:25:44.139
to know her inner thoughts.

01:25:47.098 --> 01:25:49.492
You didn't say you were
going to keep it.

01:25:51.798 --> 01:25:53.800
I mean, really.

01:25:53.844 --> 01:25:55.150
She's gone to pieces.

01:25:56.238 --> 01:25:57.891
And what on God's
green earth were you doing

01:25:57.935 --> 01:26:01.417
sending her letters?
How was that therapeutic?

01:26:03.027 --> 01:26:05.334
Oh, my boy.

01:26:06.944 --> 01:26:12.210
How little you understand
about the abnormal mind.

01:26:12.254 --> 01:26:15.257
No, no, no, no,
it's a good thing

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.346
that you are so cute.

01:26:17.389 --> 01:26:20.871
Otherwise I might not
keep you around.

01:26:20.914 --> 01:26:23.265
No, no, come on, no, no.

01:26:23.308 --> 01:26:25.528
I missed you.

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:29.532
Did you?

01:26:32.622 --> 01:26:35.451
I'm in the mood for
a Pimm's Cup.

01:26:35.494 --> 01:26:38.715
Would you be a darling
and slice the cucumbers for me?

01:26:45.678 --> 01:26:46.810
With pleasure.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:23.586
Come on, where is she.

01:27:31.376 --> 01:27:34.031
Okay, here she is.

01:27:38.688 --> 01:27:40.080
Oh, just in time.

01:27:41.473 --> 01:27:43.388
I was beginning to get worried.

01:27:47.479 --> 01:27:49.002
What are you doing here?

01:27:51.048 --> 01:27:52.179
I came to explain.

01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:55.313
Explain what?

01:27:58.795 --> 01:28:00.797
Explain what?

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:04.844
Oh, suit yourself,
but this is a marvelous vintage.

01:28:04.888 --> 01:28:07.499
You know, one thing
you can say for Richard,

01:28:08.892 --> 01:28:12.025
he knows a good red
when he sees one.

01:28:13.592 --> 01:28:16.247
Mm, ah.

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:17.944
Why are you here?

01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:23.950
I can only help you
if you trust me.

01:28:23.994 --> 01:28:28.346
Now you do trust me,
don't you, Marie?

01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:29.478
Of course, yeah.

01:28:29.521 --> 01:28:31.044
Good, that's very good.

01:28:33.003 --> 01:28:35.745
Because I'm gonna give you
what you always wanted.

01:28:35.788 --> 01:28:38.965
I'm gonna tell you
what happened to you.

01:28:42.534 --> 01:28:44.536
After Jane killed your uncle,

01:28:46.712 --> 01:28:49.715
your Aunt Rebecca
checked you into the hospital.

01:28:52.979 --> 01:28:53.980
That's when I found you.

01:28:58.724 --> 01:29:00.509
And I loved you both equally.

01:29:03.947 --> 01:29:06.645
Jane wanted to become
the perfect assassin.

01:29:09.866 --> 01:29:11.563
Jane liked killing people.

01:29:15.959 --> 01:29:20.137
Marie loved studying ancient cultures and religions.

01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:24.271
But with Jane,
there was money to be made.

01:29:27.013 --> 01:29:29.451
When the government
proved unreliable

01:29:29.494 --> 01:29:31.975
it became evident
that we would have to find

01:29:32.018 --> 01:29:35.805
more creative ways
to finance our work.

01:29:51.473 --> 01:29:53.779
That's when
I perfected the trigger.

01:29:55.738 --> 01:29:57.479
Something that
would make Jane come out

01:29:57.522 --> 01:29:59.481
to protect you on cue.

01:30:27.117 --> 01:30:30.860
And that's when Jane and I
went into business together.

01:30:39.259 --> 01:30:44.047
And I must say we had one
hell of a good run, my dear.

01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:48.051
I mean we, we could
have gone on forever.

01:30:48.094 --> 01:30:51.010
And, you know, nobody
would have been the wiser.

01:30:54.536 --> 01:30:58.453
My colleague Kellogg had no idea he was my first guinea pig.

01:31:05.198 --> 01:31:09.464
But unfortunately for him, he got a visit from the agency.

01:31:09.507 --> 01:31:13.076
Experimental surgery,
are you out of your mind?

01:31:13.119 --> 01:31:16.340
And was stupid enough
to tell me about it.

01:31:16.383 --> 01:31:18.647
Bark, bark, bark,
bark, bark, bark, bark.

01:31:18.690 --> 01:31:20.257
Marie, Marie!

01:31:37.579 --> 01:31:40.233
And that could have
been the end of it.

01:31:40.277 --> 01:31:43.280
But Marie had to have

01:31:43.323 --> 01:31:45.195
her schoolgirl crush

01:31:45.238 --> 01:31:49.155
on her professor, and that's
when all the trouble began.

01:31:57.642 --> 01:31:58.687
Harris had to go.

01:31:59.731 --> 01:32:01.167
No question about it.

01:32:08.784 --> 01:32:10.133
But I'm not a monster.

01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:15.791
I did that one myself, for you.

01:32:17.444 --> 01:32:19.925
-Oh? What do we have here?

01:32:21.448 --> 01:32:24.843
You know the problem
with men like you?

01:32:24.887 --> 01:32:26.497
You always think you're smarter

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:28.107
than the woman
you're talking to.

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:32.416
Marie.

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.331
Stupid.

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:39.989
You see, we're one, doctor.

01:32:40.032 --> 01:32:43.558
And what Jane and I do,
we do because we have to.

01:32:43.601 --> 01:32:46.212
Marie, Marie,
I want you to listen to me.

01:32:49.041 --> 01:32:50.739
I bet you have a small dick.

01:32:50.782 --> 01:32:54.656
Marie, everything I did,
I did it for you.

01:32:54.699 --> 01:32:56.875
-Take it out.
-What?

01:32:56.919 --> 01:32:59.661
Take out your dick.

01:32:59.704 --> 01:33:03.490
Marie, Marie,
I want you to look at me.

01:33:03.534 --> 01:33:05.188
Are you gonna make us cut it off

01:33:05.231 --> 01:33:07.103
so we can
measure it for ourselves?

01:33:07.146 --> 01:33:08.844
-Please.

01:33:12.499 --> 01:33:16.068
Like we thought, tiny.

01:33:16.112 --> 01:33:18.897
Put it away now.
I find the sight depressing

01:33:18.941 --> 01:33:20.769
and we're not gonna
be depressed any more.

01:33:20.812 --> 01:33:22.727
-Please, oh please,
listen to reason.
-No!

01:33:22.771 --> 01:33:25.469
-Ow!
-For once you are gonna shut up

01:33:25.512 --> 01:33:27.384
-and listen for once.
-Okay, okay, okay.

01:33:27.427 --> 01:33:29.516
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'm listening.

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:31.823
Just be calm, stay calm.

01:33:31.867 --> 01:33:33.433
Don't tell us what to do!

01:33:33.477 --> 01:33:35.479
I'm sorry, just
please don't hurt me.

01:33:35.522 --> 01:33:38.177
Just please,
please don't hurt me.

01:33:38.221 --> 01:33:40.353
God writes a story
for each and every single

01:33:40.397 --> 01:33:42.094
one of us, doctor.

01:33:42.138 --> 01:33:43.879
Don't you remember?

01:33:43.922 --> 01:33:48.231
You kill for pleasure
and God punishes those

01:33:48.274 --> 01:33:51.190
who take their pleasure
in other people's pain.

01:33:52.365 --> 01:33:55.891
And now it's your time
for your story to end, doctor.

01:33:55.934 --> 01:34:00.722
No you, you are not as smart
as you think you are, sweetie.

01:34:01.723 --> 01:34:03.681
Oh no?

01:34:09.992 --> 01:34:14.823
Did you really think
that I would turn you

01:34:14.866 --> 01:34:17.216
into a killing machine without

01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:22.047
certain safety measures?

01:34:23.962 --> 01:34:24.833
Hmm?

01:34:30.752 --> 01:34:34.712
Only a fool creates a monster

01:34:34.756 --> 01:34:40.544
without embedding
an off switch in it.

01:34:43.373 --> 01:34:44.243
Hmm?

01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:51.990
Oh, now this is a pity.

01:34:53.992 --> 01:34:57.169
Don't you see how
I care for you, Marie?

01:35:01.478 --> 01:35:04.481
The plan was for you to
spend the rest of your life

01:35:04.524 --> 01:35:08.703
in a nice, clean
facility for killing Kevin.

01:35:12.881 --> 01:35:13.838
But now?

01:35:15.535 --> 01:35:19.844
You humiliated me.

01:35:22.978 --> 01:35:26.459
And now, I'm gonna
make you suffer for it.

01:35:38.776 --> 01:35:42.562
You know, it really is just you

01:35:42.606 --> 01:35:45.740
tiny-dicked,
locked gate motherfuckers

01:35:45.783 --> 01:35:48.133
that give the rest
of us men a bad name.

01:35:49.831 --> 01:35:51.528
Your time is up.

01:35:55.532 --> 01:35:56.402
You all right?

01:35:57.490 --> 01:36:00.058
Yeah, thank you.

01:36:03.279 --> 01:36:04.497
Richard?

01:36:05.847 --> 01:36:06.891
Dead.

01:36:12.114 --> 01:36:14.856
Just for my own edification,

01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:24.126
to whom do I have the privilege
of addressing at the moment?

01:36:34.527 --> 01:36:36.529
We're gonna get along just fine.

01:36:54.504 --> 01:36:58.464
Once you've had a violent
stalker penetrate your life

01:36:58.508 --> 01:37:00.205
you will not be the same.

01:37:00.249 --> 01:37:03.469
The paranoia,
it never goes away.

01:37:04.775 --> 01:37:07.778
Not a day goes by when
I do not think of Brighton

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.565
and all of
the people he murdered.

01:37:14.611 --> 01:37:17.527
I think about how he was
almost the end of my life.

01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:20.704
My story.

01:37:22.749 --> 01:37:27.842
And there are still times
when I feel paralyzed with fear.

01:37:29.931 --> 01:37:35.197
But then I remind myself
that what Brighton did to me,

01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:40.898
what anyone does to you,

01:37:43.335 --> 01:37:45.163
it's not the end of your story.

01:37:48.732 --> 01:37:50.255
It's just the beginning.

01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:52.518
Thank you.

01:38:01.527 --> 01:38:04.748
Now, do any of y'all have
any questions for Miss Marie?

01:38:06.924 --> 01:38:09.144
-You, right here.
-Hi.

01:38:09.187 --> 01:38:12.756
-Hi.
-So now that you've
come forth with your story,

01:38:12.799 --> 01:38:15.063
I mean you've revealed so much.

01:38:15.106 --> 01:38:17.761
I feel like I know you.

01:38:17.804 --> 01:38:22.897
Your writing is so, uh,
natural and mature.

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.637
Thank you.

01:38:24.681 --> 01:38:28.467
I just, I wonder, putting
yourself out there like this,

01:38:28.511 --> 01:38:31.557
I mean do you think
that you're opening yourself up

01:38:31.601 --> 01:38:34.212
to other stalkers
coming after you?

01:38:52.752 --> 01:38:57.409
For their sake, we hope not.
