31:33.620 --> 31:35.290

right there.

31:35.290 --> 31:38.360
In my research, I actually found
a trail that's closer.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.390
Closer?
Than this?

31:40.390 --> 31:42.130

is located.

If the tail map is accurate,

the higgins haunting

Dorothy actually didn't fall

And, you know, falling down

there is a phenomena
where because you thought

37:37.450 --> 37:39.680
dorothy did pass away there,

37:39.690 --> 37:40.950

is trying to make

37:40.950 --> 37:42.650
sense of the information
you already have,

37:42.660 --> 37:43.820

The white man came in.

Of course, a lot of unhappy

38:52.490 --> 38:53.730
Even though our evidence

38:53.730 --> 38:55.930
showed no connection
to native americans,

38:55.930 --> 38:58.130
it did point to dorothy's
brother robert

38:58.130 --> 39:01.770

of activity in both houses.

39:01.770 --> 39:03.970
There could be something here
with intelligence

39:03.970 --> 39:06.470
because when we started
talking to robert,

39:06.470 --> 39:09.370
we were getting
direct responses.

39:09.380 --> 39:12.380

39:14.950 --> 39:16.610
I heard a male voice.

39:16.620 --> 39:18.120

that important to us

39:18.120 --> 39:19.820
is that it's doing
what we're asking,

39:19.820 --> 39:21.190
and it's on command,

39:21.190 --> 39:24.020

we're referencing robert,

39:24.020 --> 39:25.560
which sort of leads us
to believe

39:25.560 --> 39:28.960
that could be who we are
communicating with.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.300
Okay.

39:30.300 --> 39:32.830

the exact place robert died,

40:00.930 --> 40:03.430
we do know
he did grow up here,

40:03.430 --> 40:07.000
and because we got responses
from him and not from dorothy,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.530
tim and native
american spirits,

40:09.540 --> 40:12.300
it leads us to believe that
robert is behind the haunting

40:12.310 --> 40:16.340
and remains spiritually
attached to the home.

40:16.340 --> 40:19.310
Robert might be
the dominant spirit here.

40:19.310 --> 40:20.450
Jason: And on cue.

40:20.450 --> 40:23.050

of how to interact

40:23.050 --> 40:25.350
with the physical
world here.

40:25.350 --> 40:27.320
That's incredible.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.720
But what about the apparition

40:28.720 --> 40:31.790

experiences in the guest house?

40:36.400 --> 40:37.830

create it.

40:39.730 --> 40:41.100

where people do feel
either a weight on their chest

41:07.060 --> 41:08.860
or that they're being choked.

41:08.860 --> 41:10.800
And it's tough to say
because we weren't there,

41:10.800 --> 41:13.360
but if it was something
that seemed to continue,

41:13.370 --> 41:15.130
then I would be concerned.

41:15.140 --> 41:18.270
But what we discovered,
there's nothing to fear.

41:18.270 --> 41:19.770
And if there's any more
problems,

41:19.770 --> 41:21.210
just call us
and we'll come back.

41:21.210 --> 41:22.270
We'll do whatever you need.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.910
I appreciate you guys
so much.

41:23.910 --> 41:25.140
-Oh, well, thank you.
-Thank you.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.180
It's been a great experience
and an honor

41:27.180 --> 41:28.310
to meet you guys,
honestly.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.080
-Well, thank you.
-Thank you.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.680
Jason: Knowing dorothy did not
die a torturous death

41:32.690 --> 41:34.020
at the foot of the stairs

41:34.020 --> 41:36.490
and tim didn't commit suicide
in the guest house,

41:36.490 --> 41:37.920
we have no reason to believe

41:37.920 --> 41:42.360
that they would be a threatening
presence targeting the family.

41:42.360 --> 41:45.500
We hope that this new
understanding of old family ties

41:45.500 --> 41:47.570
helps the higgins family
live in harmony

41:47.570 --> 41:49.670
with the former residents
who are still attached

41:49.670 --> 41:53.000
to their childhood home
and brings peace of mind

41:53.010 --> 41:55.240
for their baby's safety
in the nursery.

41:55.240 --> 42:00.210
