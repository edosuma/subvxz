00:45.160 --> 00:46.844
Coochie, coochie, coochie!

00:50.880 --> 00:53.645
Yeah. No, I know. Uh-huh.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.320
No, I'm not. I'm not.
No, I'm paying attention.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.121
Mom, I'm listening. Just talk.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.801

I'm in the car. I'm literally in the car.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.565
David, hey. David Clark.

02:12.760 --> 02:13.841
Rick Nathanson.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.724
- Uh, I'm sorry.
- Little Ricky. We went to college together.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.644
Oh, shit. Hey, dude.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.287
We all took ecstasy at Dave Matthews
one time and I tried to kiss you.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.844
That's right. I remember that. Yeah.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.167
Yeah. "Crash."

02:27.360 --> 02:28.441
Yup.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.564
Wow. I didn't recognize you.
You look very different.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.888
I've gained a little bit of daddy weight.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.491
You know the drill.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.250
Actually, I don't, no.

02:37.880 --> 02:41.009
- No way. No way! Still a free agent.
- Mm.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.363
You son of a bitch!
You lucky son of a bitch.

02:44.600 --> 02:48.525
You lucky, lucky son of a bitch.
Wow, that's amazing. Wow.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.086
Here. For old times' sake, huh?

02:52.960 --> 02:54.041
For daddy stress.

02:55.080 --> 02:56.411
You're still dealing weed?

02:56.920 --> 02:58.445
Best in Denver.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.328
That's fucking awesome. Oh, my God.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.446
That is so cool.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.369
- You're still at it.
- Yeah.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.642
- I envy you, man. I do.
- Ah.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.525
Look at you. No wife, no kids.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.091
- No responsibilities.
- Mm-hm.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.567
Pfft, nothing. You got nothing.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.161
You could disappear tomorrow
and who'd even know?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.924
- Oh, what I wouldn't give.
- Yeah.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.361
Oh, hey, I didn't mean
that in like, I mean...

03:22.560 --> 03:25.211
No. It's all right. It doesn't bother me.
It's all right.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.604
- Great seeing you.
- Great seeing you.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.370
Okay, bud, I believe in you.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.409
- Hey, David?
- Yeah?

03:31.880 --> 03:34.247
- Facebook me. We'll get weird.
- I don't think so.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.245
- Ha, ha! Get out of here.
- Good luck with the family.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.804
Oh, fuck. Fuck me. Fuck.
Hey, great news.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.923
We're gonna get high and fuck tonight.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.407
I'm sorry, honey.
Put Mommy on the phone, okay?

04:00.640 --> 04:04.326
<i>I'm-a take my skin', boot, rings
All off</i>

04:04.520 --> 04:07.888
<i>Skirt, boots, rings All off</i>

04:08.080 --> 04:11.129
<i>Ooh, baby, you so bad, boy
Drive me mad, boy</i>

04:11.320 --> 04:13.402
<i>You don't care what they
Say about me</i>

04:13.640 --> 04:17.406
<i>Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem, problem</i>

04:25.440 --> 04:26.805
Wow.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.731
- You dance super good.
- Thanks.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.002
I'm Kymberly. With a Y.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.522
I'm Rose. With an R.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.804
Is that your stage name?

04:38.040 --> 04:39.883
- My what?
- Your stage name.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.323
To protect yourself from the creeps
out there. You should pick one.

04:43.520 --> 04:48.401
You know, something simple but sexy
and cute and short, maybe.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.086
- Do you have a nickname?
- Totally!

04:51.280 --> 04:52.520
Great. Use that, because...

04:52.720 --> 04:54.643
I even got a tattoo of it.
Do you wanna see?

04:54.840 --> 04:55.921
Uh, well, n...

04:56.120 --> 04:57.326
Check it out.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.087
"Boner Garage." Oh, whoa.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.049
You got a little arrow there even.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.009
Is that not like the hottest?

05:05.240 --> 05:07.242
Boner Garage, you're up.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.570
Oh, look at that. So excited and
full of life. That'll fade.

05:11.760 --> 05:16.641
Hey, Rose. I know you're "technically" on
break, but I need a lap dance. Table five.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.684
Just don't get too close.
The guy has two hook hands.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.730
How did we let that guy back in here?

05:23.160 --> 05:25.401
Must have picked the locks. Ha, ha!

05:53.680 --> 05:54.886
How was work this evening?

05:55.120 --> 05:56.201
What do you care?

05:56.400 --> 05:57.526
I'm just asking.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.960
Oh, just don't.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.203
Fine. Well, is your dummy boyfriend around?

06:01.400 --> 06:03.721
No. Jimmy's with his parents. Why?

06:03.960 --> 06:06.804
Well, because Jimmy still owes me
400 bucks, so...

06:07.360 --> 06:09.442
Maybe you shouldn't loan drugs
to people.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.362
- All right. Good tip.
- Mm-hm.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.443
I was thinking is that maybe you
could help him out, settle his debt.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.762
- Not a fucking chance.
- You'd be doing me a solid, neighbor.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.406
Oh, really? Neighbor?
You're not a neighbor.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.604
You're a drug dealer whose apartment
smells like cheese and feet.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.690
Mm. Yeah, it's a candle
I got from Anthropologie.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.770
Cheesy Feet. That's what they call it.
It's a bestseller.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.721
Oh, Rose, got a piece of your mail here.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.767
I'd lend you some money,
but we're not neighbors.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.206
Oh, you're such a dick!

06:43.360 --> 06:45.124
Have fun dying alone, jerk.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.641
Have fun digging out the singles
from your crotch.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.609
My crotch only takes 20s, David.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.366
Hey, David.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.604
- Hi, Kenny.
- I heard you and Mrs. O'Reilly fighting.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.849
It's called flirting, Kenny.
You'll learn about it in college.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.046
What are you doing up?
It's almost 2. Where's your mom?

07:05.240 --> 07:09.245
- Uh, she went for a drink. With a friend.
- When?

07:09.920 --> 07:11.285
Last week.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.801
Uh, so I got the whole place to myself.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.731
Yeah. Rolling Han Solo
for the weekend.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.888
Mm-hm.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.964
Um, speaking of rolling,
I was wondering if...

07:22.160 --> 07:25.607
- I don't sell to kids, Kenny.
- I'm 18. I'm gonna get my own place soon.

07:25.840 --> 07:26.887
Not a kid, David.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.040
Yeah, you are. Take care.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.847
Give me my fucking phone.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.964
- You guys are such assholes.
- Hey, baby.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.400
Leave her alone.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.441
- Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
- Unhand her.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.005
Hey, leave her alone.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.723
Goddamn it, Kenny.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.039
- Fucking tough guy Huh?
- You don't have to...

07:48.040 --> 07:49.201
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.727
Easy, easy. What's going on here?

07:51.920 --> 07:55.970
- Mind your fucking business, old man.
- Oh, my God. You're a dude. Ha, ha!

07:56.200 --> 07:59.568
That scared me. Your voice was so much
deeper than your bone structure.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.762
These assholes are trying
to steal my iPhone.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.048
You have an iPhone?
Aren't you homeless?

08:04.240 --> 08:06.083
So? Fuck you, dude.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.049
Okay, this was fun. Carry on.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.890
- Come on, let's go.
- What? No.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.328
These guys are picking on her
and it's not fair.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.966
What you gonna do, white boy?
You some type of hero?

08:16.160 --> 08:17.650
Not a hero. He's a dumb kid.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.727
I got an idea. Leave the girl alone.
Just move along. Huh, what do you say?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.160
- "Move along"?
- Yeah.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.762
- What are you, some kind of cop?
- He's not a cop. He's actually really cool.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.200
- Thanks.
- He's a drug dealer.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.568
- Really?
- Goddamn it, Kenny.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.886
Give me your backpack.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.160
I don't wanna fight.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.847
Well, there's not gonna be a fight.
See, you either give me the backpack...

08:37.039 --> 08:39.566
...or I'm gonna stab you in the neck
and take it.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.765
It's a real Sophie's choice here, huh?
All right.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.286
Okay, backpack it is.

08:45.480 --> 08:46.561
If you wa...

08:49.080 --> 08:50.161
Run, Kenny!

08:52.400 --> 08:53.561
You're dead meat!

08:58.400 --> 09:02.325
Hey, sorry, I dropped my phone.
Are we still going out tonight or what?

09:04.080 --> 09:05.730
Fucking shit! Shit!

09:08.440 --> 09:09.885
Oh, shit.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.970
Sorry. This is fucking dumb.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.169
Whoa-ho-ho, motherfucker.

09:29.080 --> 09:32.004
- We got you now.
- Unh!

09:32.200 --> 09:35.283
- Do whatever's in the safe too.
- Look at that.

09:35.480 --> 09:38.324
It's not even my money.
If you take that my boss will kill me.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.370
You okay, David?
I can help. I'll call the cops.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.011
No, I'm okay.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.847
Hey!

10:01.480 --> 10:03.289
Whoa, what the...! Unh!

10:03.480 --> 10:05.482
When Mr. Brad calls, you answer!
Get in there!

10:14.480 --> 10:17.529
Please don't tell me
where we're going. I love surprises.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.362
- All right. Okay.
- Can I help you?

10:20.560 --> 10:22.688
Hi. You ordered two black guys.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.848
Oh. Okay. This guy.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.361
No. David Clark here
to see Mr. Gurdlinger, please?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.921
I'll tell him you're here.
Can I get you something?

10:30.120 --> 10:31.929
Coffee. Tea. Fresca.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.167
Hmm.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.801
You know what,
a Fresca sounds really good.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.519
- You got it.
- Appreciate it.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.966
Hold on one second.
You guys want anything? It's on me.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.326
Replenishes electrolytes.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.205
Don't want you cramping up
when you jerk each other off.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.481
Nice meeting you.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.320
Easy.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.370
Easy. Oof!

10:52.560 --> 10:54.881
Okay. I'm gonna hang out here
if that's all right.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.128
Oh, thank you for that.
That's very helpful.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.085
Oh! David Clark.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.250
You're a hard man to find.
Take it easy on the plastic.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.761
Whoa, Brad, what the fuck is this?

11:06.600 --> 11:09.126
Look, man, I was gonna call you back.
Do not kill me.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.521
- I got robbed, okay. I swear.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:11.640 --> 11:12.766
What are you...? What...?

11:12.960 --> 11:14.007
Oh, the plastic?

11:14.280 --> 11:15.441
Yeah, the plastic.

11:15.640 --> 11:16.687
I've seen Dexter.

11:16.880 --> 11:21.488
Buddy, I'm putting in a new skylight,
you idiot. Ha, ha.

11:21.960 --> 11:25.043
You should have seen your face just now.
You shit a brick.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.364
Well, what am I supposed to think, man?

11:27.560 --> 11:30.370
You've got these thugs throwing a bag
over my head. Come on.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.121
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't mean to freak you out.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.324
- It's fine.
- You do know I've killed people though?

11:36.960 --> 11:38.086
Yeah, Brad, I know.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.486
Ha-ha. All right, have a seat.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.605
Whoa, what the fuck is that?

11:42.840 --> 11:46.083
What? Oh, my orca?
Yeah, I bought an orca.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.324
I make a lot of money.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.961
So you bought a whale?

11:52.160 --> 11:53.685
Well, I don't like sports cars.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.360
- Yeah, yeah.
- So where's my money, David?

11:56.680 --> 11:59.160
Come on, man. We go back.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.368
We do go back.
But it's not college anymore.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.608
We're not selling lids out of my dorm room.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.371
And you owe me $43,000.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.564
I told you, I got robbed, Brad.
They took everything I had, man.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.843
This week's drop, 22 grand
of my money that I'd saved. I'm fucked.

12:13.080 --> 12:18.166
Listen, this is a fucked-up situation.
But I might have a win-win for both of us.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.451
- Great.
- I have a smidge of very choice...

12:21.640 --> 12:23.324
...mari-ju-ana down in Mexico...

12:23.520 --> 12:25.409
...and I need it here by Sunday night.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.444
My regular courier is out
because he got gunned down.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.920
That's where you come in.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.727
You could be my mule.
I need someone I can trust.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.527
Go to Mexico, bring it back by Sunday
night, not only will I forgive your debt...

12:36.720 --> 12:41.089
...I will pay you
a standard courier fee of $100,000.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.369
You're gonna give me 100 grand to move
a smidge across the border?

12:45.240 --> 12:47.447
Smidge and a half. It's nothing.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.644
Dude, I got rolled
by the fucking cast of <i>Annie.</i>

12:50.840 --> 12:54.401
I come walking in here and you ask me
to be an international drug dealer.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.888
This is easy money, David.
All you gotta do is pop down to Mexico...

12:58.080 --> 13:01.527
...go to this address, tell them you're
there to pick up for Pablo Chacon.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.848
- Who the fuck is Pablo Chacon?
- I am.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.766
You don't get respect from Mexicans
when your name is Brad Gurdlinger, right?

13:10.960 --> 13:15.522
I mean, that's white in any language.
See? Big Bad Brad thought of everything.

13:18.200 --> 13:22.091
I don't know. I don't think so, man.
This is way out of my league.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.685
It's a federal crime.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.805
If I try to cross the border with more
than a pound, you're talking like, um...

13:28.960 --> 13:32.009
Twenty-five years in Mexican prison.
If you get a happy judge.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.242
Yeah. Jeez. Not good.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.966
- Although, you're forgetting one thing.
- What?

13:37.160 --> 13:39.527
You don't have a fucking choice.

13:42.680 --> 13:45.445
So now you're gonna become
an even bigger drug dealer?

13:45.640 --> 13:48.007
Drug smuggler, Kenny.
There's a difference.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.001
You're probably gonna get
searched at the border.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.722
No offense, you look like
a total drug dealer.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.605
- No shit. Thanks, dude.
- You could wear a disguise.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.605
- What?
- A disguise.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.484
That's what I thought. A disguise.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.684
I dress up. What's the hot
Halloween outfit these days?

14:06.880 --> 14:09.611
Bane from Batman? Someone like that?
Wear something over my face?

14:09.800 --> 14:12.565
There's no drugs in here.
You've got nothing to worry about.

14:12.760 --> 14:13.920
Great idea.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.326
Hey, pardon me. Hi.

14:18.520 --> 14:23.162
Hate to bug you, but I'm trying to get the
fam to the zoo and I'm lost as all heck.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.930
Fuck off, real-life Flanders.

14:25.520 --> 14:30.242
It's my fault. When it comes to reading
maps, I sure can be an old flibbertigibbet.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.724
Hey. No parking here, sir.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.410
Perfect. Fucking tourists.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.041
Oh, jeez. I'm awful sorry, officer.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.163
I don't know which way is up around here.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.011
No problem.
Our city can get confusing sometimes.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.770
Trying to find our way to the zoo.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.806
It's two blocks up that way,
take a left, two blocks...

14:54.760 --> 14:55.841
Holy fucking shit.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.205
Thank you, dickheads.

15:00.320 --> 15:03.449
<i>Hey little lady, don't you say maybe</i>

15:03.640 --> 15:06.530
Rose, the guy at the bar asked for you
by name.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.131
Treat him nice.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.561
<i>Baby, I'ma show you how to</i>

15:10.800 --> 15:11.881
Yeah!

15:12.240 --> 15:13.969
Hi. I'm Rose.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.730
- Hi. Hi.
- What...? Oh, please. No.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.968
- No, Rose. Hey, Rose, Rose.
- No, no, no, no.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.527
- Please. Listen to me.
- Duh, duh, duh, duh.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.644
Ch-ch-ch-chuh.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.330
You asshole.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.405
Don't worry. You don't have
to get naked and all that stuff.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.931
- Unless you want to, you know. Oof!
- Mm-hm.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.400
- Fuck.
- What do you want?

15:40.280 --> 15:43.523
How would you like to spend 4th of July
weekend making 10 grand?

15:43.720 --> 15:44.801
- What?
- Rose, listen.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.725
All I'm asking is that you
go to Mexico with me.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.125
All right? And then we drive home together
in an RV.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.401
Mm-hm.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.080
- And that RV has some pot in it.
- Drug dealing?

15:55.280 --> 15:58.045
No, it's not drug dealing. It's not.
No, it's smuggling.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.402
- Are you out of your mind?
- Rose, listen to me.

16:00.760 --> 16:05.322
Now, me crossing the border by myself,
huge red flag. Huge, all right?

16:05.560 --> 16:07.642
But families,
they don't get a second look.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.730
So, Rose, I need you to be my wife.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.882
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

16:14.080 --> 16:17.641
Look, Rose, 10,000 bucks,
and your flight's already paid for.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.205
You can't buy me.

16:19.400 --> 16:22.370
I'm not buying you, all right?
I'm renting you.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.607
Hmm.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.006
<i>Like Pretty Woman.</i>

16:26.200 --> 16:28.043
<i>Pretty Woman?</i>
She was a prostitute.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.924
And I don't trust you.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.171
- What did she say?
- What the fuck do you think? She said no.

16:37.360 --> 16:41.331
Cool. So I guess it's just us, then. A little
father and son bonding trip to Mexico.

16:41.560 --> 16:45.485
Are you kidding? You and me alone in a van?
It'll look like the pervert Olympics.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.882
No way. Absolutely not.
No, we need a girl.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.687
And unless you can think of someone
that can leave town tomorrow, I'm fucked.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.491
I know a girl.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.288
I don't get it. What's in it for me?

17:00.480 --> 17:04.690
I'm thinking a roof over your head, some
actual hot food. That'd be good enough.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.165
I'm thinking 1000.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.682
Fine, 1000 bucks, but that's it.

17:09.920 --> 17:14.130
Great. And if we get caught I'll say you
drugged and kidnapped me. Cool?

17:15.200 --> 17:18.249
Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, that's fine.
But that's it.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.801
Kenny, meet your new sister.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.807
This is great. I've always wanted a sister.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.489
- Get it off me. Get it off! Get off!
- Hey, come on. Let go.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.411
- Come on. We gotta clean you up.
- What's wrong with you?

17:32.600 --> 17:35.331
- Don't say that.
- I didn't mean to make her uncomfortable.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.646
<i>Wild child</i>

17:36.840 --> 17:38.410
Boner Garage!

17:38.600 --> 17:41.171
<i>Going all out Going for broke</i>

17:43.400 --> 17:45.607
Oh, great. Rose, I'm glad I caught you.

17:45.800 --> 17:49.043
I wanted to go over a couple
of minor policy changes...

17:49.240 --> 17:52.050
- ...that we have here at the club.
- Like what?

17:52.240 --> 17:55.562
Like, I want you to start having sex
with the customers for money.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.569
What? That's totally illegal, Todd.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.290
Come on, what are you gonna do?

18:01.480 --> 18:06.088
I gotta stay competitive with those
fuckers who opened up across the street.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.725
You mean the Apple Store?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.365
Yeah, and they're killing us.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.806
Oh, God.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.970
That's it. I can't do it. I quit.

18:14.600 --> 18:15.886
Did you hear the good news?

18:16.080 --> 18:18.367
Now we get to fuck the customers
for money.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.041
- Wha...?
- Boner Garage loves it.

18:21.280 --> 18:25.365
I'm out of here. I am out of here.
I quit.

18:35.560 --> 18:36.686
Fuck.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.366
Fuck.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.568
So, Casey, I guess it's nice for you
to get your hair cut.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.285
Being homeless and all...

19:06.480 --> 19:10.121
I'm not homeless, fucktard. I have a home.
But I left because my parent...

19:10.320 --> 19:14.564
Shut up, okay? Please. I don't need
to hear your hard-luck backstory right now.

19:14.760 --> 19:19.368
I rented Precious on Netflix eight months
ago and I still haven't watched the thing.

19:19.560 --> 19:20.641
Here. You know what?

19:20.880 --> 19:24.202
Just give me a little peace and quiet
and buy yourself some new clothes.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.722
You know, the kind of stuff that loved
children wear. Not this garbage.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.445
All right? Thank you.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.841
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.608
You're fine.
You already like a total dipshit.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.924
Here. You're gonna need it.
You look like Eminem from <i>8 Mile.</i>

19:40.400 --> 19:42.528
Go with her.
Make sure she doesn't steal it.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.609
And stay the fuck out of Hot Topic.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.400
David Clark?

19:47.160 --> 19:49.401
Okay, what are we doing today?

19:49.600 --> 19:52.570
Yeah, I say,
give me something that says:

19:52.760 --> 19:56.970
"I get up every morning at 5:30 and
commute for an hour to a bullshit job...

19:57.200 --> 19:59.771
...where my boss expects me
to kiss his balls all day...

19:59.960 --> 20:03.965
...so I can afford to keep my ungrateful
kids decked out in Dora the Explorer shit...

20:04.160 --> 20:06.321
...and my wife up to her fat ass
in self-help videos...

20:06.520 --> 20:09.285
...until the day I get the courage
to put a shotgun in my mouth."

20:11.800 --> 20:13.006
Right here.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.843
Yeah. That's it. That's the one.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.201
All right.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.211
Get a full body check.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.925
Sorry.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.808
Hi, you folks have everything you need?

21:26.200 --> 21:27.406
Oh, you betcha!

21:27.600 --> 21:31.685
Yeah, we're heading out on a family vacay
here, you know? Off to see grandma, huh?

21:32.440 --> 21:34.010
Well, you have a lovely family.

21:34.200 --> 21:37.522
Oh, thank you very much. Yeah, this
is my son, Kenny Miller, right here.

21:37.720 --> 21:40.041
- And my lovely daughter...
- Casey?

21:40.240 --> 21:43.369
Casey. Casey Miller, that's right.
And I'm David Miller.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.607
We're the Millers.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.646
Yeah, now, you know, I got my hands
full here. Couple of kooky teenagers.

21:49.080 --> 21:52.641
Yeah, I'm going through all those
typical teenage girl issues like:

21:52.840 --> 21:55.491
Finals and college applications...

21:55.800 --> 21:58.007
...and am I gonna get asked to prom.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.680
Plus, I haven't gotten my period in
two months...

22:01.000 --> 22:03.924
...which is really weird because
I've mostly just been doing anal.

22:05.560 --> 22:08.484
Ha-ha-ha! Oh, that's enough.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.731
Well, thank you for your help, "Natalie."

22:13.600 --> 22:15.250
Take your seats, please.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.646
You fucking kidding me?

22:18.840 --> 22:20.808
I'm good. I got it.
Right over here. Thanks.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.923
Thank you. Sorry.

22:23.120 --> 22:27.569
- Honey! Hi! You made it!
- Mm-hm. Eat a dick.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.285
- Sorry, sorry. Okay.
- Mm-mm.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.768
- Wow, you look really, like...
- Don't. Just don't, all right?

22:33.160 --> 22:34.207
Hi, Mom.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.561
- Jesus.
Mm-hm.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.725
And who's that?

22:37.920 --> 22:40.730
Well, that's your daughter. Casey.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.287
Hey.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.766
Mm-hm.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.286
I want 30,000 now.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.127
- No fucking way.
- Okay. Have a safe flight.

22:48.320 --> 22:52.291
What? No. Okay. Fine!
Fine. Bloodsucker.

22:52.480 --> 22:56.405
Mm. All right, happy wife,
happy life. Hi, kids!

22:57.720 --> 22:59.927
- Make room for your mother.
- Okay.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.364
- Hey!
- Whoa! No, I didn't...!

23:04.560 --> 23:07.530
What the fuck? Don't you ever think
that you can ever...

23:07.720 --> 23:10.007
Family meeting. Let's go.
Get in the back. Go.

23:10.240 --> 23:11.924
- I didn't mean to.
- I don't care.

23:12.160 --> 23:16.210
- He just hit me in the fucking face.
- Will you march? No one wants to hear...

23:18.880 --> 23:20.803
What the fuck?! Are you kidding me?

23:21.080 --> 23:23.447
Oh, come on, relax, Dorothy. Jesus.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.211
We're not at the border.
Who cares what they think?

23:26.400 --> 23:29.324
It's about not drawing attention
to ourselves, you little hobo.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.843
Hey! Don't talk to her like that.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.120
Rose, relax, okay?
The only thing you need to worry about...

23:35.240 --> 23:37.971
...is making them think you could
be someone's mother. Okay?

23:38.160 --> 23:40.561
Are you kidding me?
I can do this shit in my sleep.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.091
Excuse me.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.807
Lord, we thank thee for the blessing
of this family vacation.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.560
May David find his bliss
and bring us home back safely.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.889
May Kenny and Casey fortify
their sibling bond...

23:54.080 --> 23:57.209
...over the warm glow
of our devoted hearts.

23:57.600 --> 24:01.241
And may this entire airplane
find safe passage...

24:01.440 --> 24:03.488
...and a bountiful life.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.366
Even the Jews.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.210
- Amen.
- That was a good one.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.890
That was beautiful.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.367
- Oh.
- I wish my family was more like that.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.244
Oh, stop. Don't.

24:14.440 --> 24:17.887
No, no, no. Come on. Come in here.
Hug it out. Don't you cry.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.206
Aw, honey.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.571
<i>Fuck you.</i>

24:21.840 --> 24:23.604
All better now? Okay.

24:23.840 --> 24:27.925
Oh, and don't forget you can use Chex Mix
as a surprise casserole topping.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.929
Adds that real special crunch.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.009
- Wow, what a great tip.
- Sure!

24:32.240 --> 24:33.366
Bye-bye.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.288
Holy shit, where did that come from?

24:36.480 --> 24:39.324
It's five summers with my Aunt Barb
in Oklahoma.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.601
That was amazing.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.564
Calm down. It wasn't that great.

24:42.760 --> 24:46.321
Ah, goddamn it. Brad said the RV was
supposed to be out here waiting for us.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.522
Anybody sees a camper, just let me know.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.207
Whoa.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.884
What the fuck is this?

25:03.080 --> 25:04.206
This thing is ridiculous.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.770
- Can you drive this?
- I don't know.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.371
How fast does it go?

25:41.920 --> 25:44.048
Why the hell are you reading that thing?

25:46.040 --> 25:48.884
Because I like it. It's fun.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.411
It's informative.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.523
"It's fun." That's your idea of fun, huh?

25:52.720 --> 25:55.371
I have a VCR manual from the '90s
you should check out.

25:55.560 --> 25:58.325
- I think you'd probably enjoy that.
- Fireworks!

25:58.520 --> 26:00.045
Oh, my God, guys, look!

26:00.280 --> 26:02.851
Fireworks! Hey! Fireworks!
Pull over! There's fireworks!

26:03.080 --> 26:04.684
We're not pulling over for fireworks.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.281
- Oh, Oh, stern.
- What? It's Fourth of July weekend.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.448
Don't be such a grumpy asshole. Pull over!

26:09.640 --> 26:10.926
No. Absolutely not.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.764
Oh, come on, I vote fireworks too.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.970
See? Even this loser wants fireworks.
Fireworks!

26:16.160 --> 26:18.481
- Fireworks! Fireworks!
- The kids wanna see fireworks.

26:18.720 --> 26:20.600
Fireworks!
Fireworks! Fireworks!

26:20.720 --> 26:21.846
Okay, enough!

26:25.160 --> 26:28.767
Enough!
Let's get something straight right now!

26:28.960 --> 26:30.883
You are not my kids! Okay?

26:31.280 --> 26:33.647
You are not my wife!
And we are not a family!

26:33.840 --> 26:35.285
All right? This is a job!

26:35.480 --> 26:37.005
We are not the Brady Bunch!

26:37.240 --> 26:39.925
I'm Marky Mark
and y'all are the Funky Bunch!

26:40.840 --> 26:43.525
- The what?
- I'm the boss. You hear me?

26:43.800 --> 26:48.647
So cut the shit! Otherwise, I will turn
this RV around immediately!

26:48.960 --> 26:52.487
And we will drive straight home.
No drugs for anyone!

26:52.960 --> 26:54.041
This vacation sucks.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.605
You...

26:56.120 --> 26:57.645
It is not a vacation!

27:05.680 --> 27:07.603
There we go. You fucking happy? Come on.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.201
Here we go. Everybody
just be cool. All right?

27:22.280 --> 27:23.486
Hey there!

27:23.680 --> 27:26.923
You got the Miller family here,
reporting for leisure, sir.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.401
We're just heading down
to <i>México</i> way to do a...

27:31.280 --> 27:35.888
Oh. Okay. Great. Fantastic. All right,
thank you. Take care, now. All right.

27:36.960 --> 27:41.488
Whoo! Did you see that? I told you
this RV would work! We totally blend.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.405
Congratulations. You
just snuck into Mexico.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.527
What is this?

27:51.720 --> 27:53.404
- A meth lab?
- It's Mexico, Casey.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.364
That's a donkey, donkey, donkey.

27:55.800 --> 27:59.088
- This RV blends right in, David.
- Will you calm down?

27:59.400 --> 28:02.404
This thing is ginormous.
I mean, it's ridiculous.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.441
<i>You have
arrived at your destination.</i>

28:11.560 --> 28:13.483
<i>The route guidance is now finished.</i>

28:13.680 --> 28:15.682
Are you sure these guys are expecting you?

28:15.920 --> 28:17.604
Rose, we're good. All right?

28:17.840 --> 28:21.162
Now will you calm down? These are
Brad's guys. Nothing to worry about.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.964
Open Sesame. Here we go.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.726
Hey!

28:25.440 --> 28:27.408
Hey, I think that guy was in <i>La Bamba.</i>

28:28.280 --> 28:31.124
Is that a little football over there?
That's fun. Soccer.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.845
Kids are a good sign, I guess.

28:37.080 --> 28:40.641
- Hey there.
- What is this place?

28:40.840 --> 28:43.969
Will you look at this?
It's a cute little drug-dealing community.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.804
They probably sell churros.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.490
Will you relax?

28:48.680 --> 28:50.842
It's fine. We're totally fine.

28:51.120 --> 28:55.250
I'll run in, pick up a duffel bag, a suitcase
or something and we'll be on our way.

28:55.440 --> 28:59.001
Hi. Now come on.
See, it's the welcome wagon.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.440
Let me go talk to this guy.

29:01.400 --> 29:05.121
<i>Hola. Hola,</i> big man, <i>me llamo</i> David.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.641
Yeah, I'm here to pick
up for Brad Gurdlinger.

29:09.720 --> 29:10.846
- Oh.
- He's got a gun.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.247
- Oh, God.
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

29:13.480 --> 29:16.927
- Oh, God.
- Palo Hacon! Palo Hacon!

29:17.120 --> 29:18.485
Pablo Chacon?

29:20.880 --> 29:23.406
Pablo Chacon. I'm here to pick up
for Pablo Chacon.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.921
You are the White Gringo
with the haircut of a donkey.

29:26.120 --> 29:27.929
Uh, yeah. <i>Sí.</i>

29:28.160 --> 29:31.721
Yeah. Yeah, <i>mucho white-o.</i>
Very, very gringo. Yeah.

29:31.920 --> 29:35.766
- Who are they?
- Um, that's my "family."

29:36.000 --> 29:38.162
You know, uh, <i>mi familia.</i>

29:38.360 --> 29:41.409
You know, helping me out here
with the deal. Yeah.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.205
Yeah.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.846
Yeah. I know, I can't believe it either.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.920
<i>Do you see his eye? Jesus Christ.</i>

29:52.960 --> 29:54.689
Come! Drugs now.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.689
- Okay, great.
- What?

29:56.880 --> 29:58.530
That's great. Let's do it. Okay.

30:00.160 --> 30:03.607
All right, big fella, where's the smidge
of weed everyone's talking about?

30:15.320 --> 30:18.085
- This is a little more than a smidge.
- Oh, dear.

30:18.280 --> 30:19.964
Calm down. Okay?
We're gonna be fine.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.571
Oh, yeah, sure, right.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.684
All we're doing is smuggling
two metric tons of marijuana...

30:24.920 --> 30:28.208
...across an international border
in a rented motor home!

30:28.720 --> 30:31.451
I don't see what could possibly go wrong!
Ugh!

30:33.040 --> 30:35.850
Okay, uh, I'm gonna
make a phone call real quick.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.607
Kenny, watch the pot.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.921
It's a great place.

30:46.440 --> 30:47.851
Fuck you.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.445
<i>Hey. Buddy.</i>

31:00.600 --> 31:04.241
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm like an amazing sculptor.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.006
<i>- What are you talking about?
- I've been working all day.</i>

31:07.160 --> 31:11.609
It's an orca and he's breaching
and I'm balls deep in his blow hole.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.847
<i>What the fuck?</i>

31:13.040 --> 31:14.087
<i>Uh-oh, something wrong?</i>

31:14.240 --> 31:16.891
Yeah! Something's wrong.
Something's very, very wrong. Okay?

31:17.040 --> 31:18.371
You said "a smidge of pot."

31:18.560 --> 31:20.130
<i>This is not a smidge.</i>

31:20.280 --> 31:21.770
- Smidge and a half? No?
<i>- No.</i>

31:21.920 --> 31:25.129
You got me moving enough weed
to kill Willie-fucking-Nelson, man!

31:26.160 --> 31:30.324
Okay? They're using a goddamn bucket
brigade to put it on the RV as we speak!

31:30.480 --> 31:34.201
You walked in, told them you were picking
up for Pablo Chacon and they were like:

31:34.600 --> 31:36.170
- "No problem!"
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

31:36.320 --> 31:39.403
Why do you sound surprised?
You told them we were coming, right?

31:39.560 --> 31:40.607
<i>Relax!</i>

31:40.760 --> 31:44.810
Everything's gonna be fine, man. I greased
the guard in lane one at the border.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.731
He'll let you breeze through,
I'll see you in the morning!

31:47.920 --> 31:49.251
<i>I'll even buy you brunch.</i>

31:49.520 --> 31:51.284
<i>Can I change the subject for a second?</i>

31:51.440 --> 31:53.283
If you get back and see the sculpture...

31:53.440 --> 31:56.603
...you're gonna look at it and be like,
"Whoa, those balls are huge."

31:56.760 --> 31:59.445
The balls are the only part
that are not anatomically correct.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.130
Everything else is perfect.

32:01.280 --> 32:05.444
But I made the balls a little larger
as a tribute to my manhood.

32:05.600 --> 32:06.761
Fuck you, Brad.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.888
<i>That's the David I love!</i>

32:09.040 --> 32:11.611
Fuck you too! Come on, let's do this!

32:11.760 --> 32:13.603
<i>Ha, ha! I'll see you soon,
my little drug mule!</i>

32:13.760 --> 32:15.250
<i>Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw...</i>

32:16.720 --> 32:17.721
Shit!

32:22.400 --> 32:24.721
Oh, no. Thank you. I'm good.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.845
You reject my mother's gift?

32:29.200 --> 32:31.931
I mean, I don't know
whether I'd put it in those terms.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.122
- Shut up and take the fruit.
- Right. Got it.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.446
Thank you, ma'am.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.489
- You wanna get us killed?
- What?

32:38.240 --> 32:39.401
Namaste.

32:47.800 --> 32:48.881
Whoa.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.287
I think Snoop Dogg would fuck this fridge.

32:51.520 --> 32:52.851
At least it keeps it fresh.

32:53.800 --> 32:57.441
Well, as long as no one sets foot
inside the RV...

32:57.640 --> 33:00.484
...looks through a window,
or weighs us...

33:01.440 --> 33:04.171
- ...we should be pretty good.
- We'll be fine.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.250
We're totally fucked.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.369
Aw, shit. What the hell is this?

33:25.600 --> 33:28.080
- What's it look like? It's a cop, genius.
- Be cool.

33:28.280 --> 33:31.887
- Remember we're the Millers. Okay.
- Okay. Yeah. Okay. Cool.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.487
- Oh.<i> Buenos dias,</i> officer.
<i>- Hola.</i>

33:35.680 --> 33:38.445
I'm sorry if we were violating
some of your traffic laws.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.883
You see, the family and I got into
a heated game of road bingo and...

33:42.120 --> 33:44.122
- Cut the shit.
- I'm sorry?

33:44.320 --> 33:46.846
I saw you leaving
Pablo Chacon's compound.

33:47.080 --> 33:50.084
And we both know if I search
your mobile home, what I'd find.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.282
Much prison time for such things.

33:52.480 --> 33:53.811
Yeah. Yeah.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.242
But I don't feel like arresting anybody...

33:56.440 --> 33:59.762
...so I'll just simply take my bribe
and I'll be on my way.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.083
Well, all right. Ha, ha.

34:04.560 --> 34:07.769
This is what I'm talking about.
Great! How much we talking? 100? 200?

34:07.960 --> 34:10.201
- One thousand.
- A thousand?

34:10.440 --> 34:13.125
- Mm-hm.
- What, are you buying a house down here?

34:14.000 --> 34:17.925
It's a lot. Um, we don't have
that sort of cash on us right now.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.003
You see, that's gonna be a problem.

34:22.239 --> 34:23.366
Yeah, yeah.

34:23.560 --> 34:26.928
Maybe you can offer me
something else. Say, uh...

34:28.199 --> 34:30.328
...something a little more personal?

34:32.080 --> 34:34.400
- Oh.
- Oh.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.127
I gotcha. Rose, suck his dick.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.442
Fuck you, I'm not sucking anything.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.409
Come on. Will you be a team player?

34:43.639 --> 34:46.246
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Will you stop being selfish?

34:46.440 --> 34:48.761
Please, please, <i>señora.</i>
No need to be alarmed.

34:49.480 --> 34:54.246
See, I'm, how you say, a man who
prefers the company of other men.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.889
- Oh.
- Oh.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.727
- David, suck his dick.
- Rose.

35:00.920 --> 35:03.446
Five seconds tops. Just cradle the balls.

35:03.640 --> 35:05.005
Mm.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.244
Come on, David. Be a team player.
You're gonna have fun.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.650
Um...

35:12.280 --> 35:15.045
Okay. Kenny! Front and center, buddy.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.890
Uh...

35:17.080 --> 35:18.360
Okay, so what's the plan?

35:18.520 --> 35:21.330
Go up there and pretend to
and then you're gonna jump him?

35:21.520 --> 35:22.806
The plan is, um...

35:23.000 --> 35:24.240
Here. Come here, come here.

35:24.640 --> 35:27.689
Okay, um, let's see.
You, you're this bottle cap.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.690
Right? And I am this cigarette butt.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.601
Okay, that's us. All right? Okay?
He's over there, right by this, that bush.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.006
We'll make him the pebble.

35:36.200 --> 35:39.886
You will go and meet him behind
the bush right over there.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.128
You suck his dick,
and we get outta here.

35:42.360 --> 35:44.840
- Okay? Bring it in, on three.
- What?! No!

35:45.040 --> 35:46.724
What do you mean no? What's wrong?

35:46.920 --> 35:49.605
- Well, I'm not gay.
- Are you sure?

35:50.680 --> 35:52.682
I mean, you never really know
until you know.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.287
- No. I'm not gay.
- Okay. All right. Calm down.

35:55.480 --> 35:59.485
Look, this gay panic situation you're having
now, it's coming off a little homophobic.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.401
What, because I don't want
a penis in my mouth?

36:02.600 --> 36:05.046
Exactly. It's exactly
what homophobic means.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.847
Look, you go over there, you just,
you know, you pretend it's a girl's dick.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.605
Any girl's dick you want.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.565
- I'm not sure I agree with that logic.
- Look, listen to me.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.171
- What is he saying to him?
- I have no idea.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.402
All right? Just listen to me. All right?

36:19.600 --> 36:20.726
Come on, man.

36:20.920 --> 36:23.321
This is your chance to be the hero.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.847
- I don't know, David.
- Don't do it for me.

36:27.040 --> 36:30.442
Don't even do it for you.
Do it for the girls. For Rose and Casey.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.689
Because, believe me, they won't last
two days in a Mexican prison.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.844
- Okay.
- Attaboy!

36:39.080 --> 36:41.128
- I'll do it for the girls.
- I'm proud of you.

36:42.040 --> 36:44.088
Hey. What's going on?

36:44.280 --> 36:46.851
Somebody sucking my dick,
or am I getting 1000 pesos?

36:47.040 --> 36:48.610
No, he's gonna w...

36:49.360 --> 36:51.806
- "Pesos"? Why didn't you say so?
- Mm-hm. A thousand.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.083
Oh, well, that's like, what, 80 bucks
American?

36:55.280 --> 36:57.601
Here. Here you go.
A hundred. Keep the change.

37:04.840 --> 37:08.049
Can't believe you were gonna suck
that guy's dick. Come on, let's go.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.688
<i>All vehicles, please proceed
slowly in assigned lanes...</i>

37:22.920 --> 37:24.649
<i>...and prepare for vehicle inspection.</i>

37:27.680 --> 37:29.011
Okay, here we go. This is it.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.645
Kenny, grab the hats. Hurry.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.646
You said the guard was just
gonna wave us through.

37:33.840 --> 37:37.242
He will. But let's look the part so
the others don't get suspicious.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.730
What the fuck does this guy want?

37:45.920 --> 37:47.649
I don't know. But he's honking.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.920
- Hi!
- Just ignore them.

37:51.320 --> 37:55.689
Okay, he's really honking and it's making a huge scene.
I think he just wants to say hi.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.450
Oh, my God. I don't wanna say hi.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.927
They're just waving. If we just wave,
he'll stop.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.849
Fine. I'll say hi. Fine.

38:02.640 --> 38:03.687
- Hi!
- Hi!

38:03.920 --> 38:06.969
Howdy-doody! Quite a rig you got there,
amigo.

38:07.160 --> 38:11.290
That is quite a rig
you guys have there too.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.960
Well, thank you very kindly.
We do love her.

38:14.160 --> 38:17.323
We don't take her out as often as
we used to when our girl was small.

38:17.680 --> 38:22.288
It can be such a bear to carve out quality
family time but you gotta do it, don't you?

38:22.640 --> 38:24.608
Yeah, David and Rose Miller here.

38:24.800 --> 38:25.926
Oh.

38:26.120 --> 38:29.806
This is my daughter, Casey, right here.
And my son, Kenny.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.371
- How handsome.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

38:33.560 --> 38:36.245
Don Fitzgerald,
my smoldering wife, Edith...

38:36.440 --> 38:38.249
...and our daughter. Say hi, Melissa.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.120
- <i>Lane one, please pull forward.</i>
- Oh.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.686
<i>Sir. Sir, please pull forward.</i>

38:56.920 --> 38:58.206
I got a joint here.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.322
- Shut down lane one.
- It's medicinal.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.005
- What'd he say?
- He has a joint.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.645
That's it?

39:07.840 --> 39:08.887
- Hide it.
- Okay.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.844
Get rid of it! Oh, my God!

39:11.040 --> 39:12.485
Holy shit.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.843
- Oh, that was so close.
- You have a baby!

39:15.360 --> 39:18.011
- Oh, I love babies!
- Oh.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.771
Oh, look at that gorgeous
little bundle of joy!

39:21.000 --> 39:23.128
What's that beautiful little baby's name?

39:23.880 --> 39:27.043
- This is our little...
- LeBron.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.010
- Name's LeBron.
- Yup.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.487
- Oh.
- A little French fella.

39:31.720 --> 39:32.767
It's our little LeBron.

39:32.960 --> 39:36.407
I was against the name at first, but
the missus has a real soft spot...

39:36.640 --> 39:38.760
...for prima donnas who'll never
be as good as Jordan.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.405
I can't see the face.

39:41.080 --> 39:45.005
- I'm dying to see his face.
- Sir, pull forward to lane two.

39:45.360 --> 39:48.489
- Oh, fuck! Okay, put on the hats.
- You gotta pull over.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.081
- Here we go.
- Great.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.331
- My God, I feel like a fucking idiot.
- That's the idea.

39:55.520 --> 39:59.889
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Everybody smile
and follow my lead, all right?

40:00.120 --> 40:03.010
I'm gonna take us to the promised land.
Here we go. Here we go.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.485
Steady.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.202
- Steady.
- Shit.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.289
Shh. Shh, shh. I got this one.

40:17.480 --> 40:22.646
Okay. Everybody just smile. Everybody
be cool. Here we go. Follow my lead. Ahem.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.921
You bringing anything
into the United States, sir?

40:27.120 --> 40:28.360
Yuh...

40:29.000 --> 40:31.571
Sir, are you bringing any contraband
back into the United States?

40:31.760 --> 40:32.807
Um...

40:33.000 --> 40:34.240
- Sir?
- David!

40:38.760 --> 40:41.525
Folks, I need you to pull over and exit the
vehicle, please.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.847
- But...
- Sir, is that actually necessary?

40:45.080 --> 40:47.208
I mean, these kids
are pooped and we've just...

40:47.400 --> 40:50.290
I need everybody out of this
recreational vehicle immediately.

40:50.480 --> 40:53.131
- I'll just put the baby down.
- We'll put the baby away.

40:53.320 --> 40:58.406
Bring the child, pull over to the secondary
inspection area and exit the vehicle now!

40:59.440 --> 41:00.965
- Okay.
- Good.

41:04.600 --> 41:05.840
It's okay. It's all right.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.923
It's okay, baby. It's just a puppy.

41:08.720 --> 41:09.960
Stand down.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.042
All right. It's okay.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.601
Before I search the vehicle, is there
anything you wanna tell me about?

41:17.800 --> 41:19.370
Because after I open that door...

41:20.200 --> 41:21.440
...I can't help you.

41:27.240 --> 41:30.722
Last chance. I'm gonna search this vehicle
top to bottom.

41:31.440 --> 41:32.487
All right.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.681
We got runners!

41:41.920 --> 41:43.684
We got runners!

41:44.400 --> 41:47.165
Sorry to inconvenience you, folks.
This happens a lot.

41:47.360 --> 41:48.771
You have a nice day.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.448
Go. Go, go!

42:12.920 --> 42:14.968
Ah. Well, that was fucking easy!

42:16.520 --> 42:18.010
- Oh, my God.
- God!

42:18.200 --> 42:19.247
Whoo! We did it!

42:19.520 --> 42:23.002
Nicely done, Millers! Give it up!
Very good job. Here you go.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.806
Rose! Yeah! David! There you go!

42:26.000 --> 42:30.483
We are all officially international drug
smugglers. Add it to the resume.

42:30.680 --> 42:33.524
Ha, ha.
How about a little victory music, huh?

42:37.840 --> 42:38.921
Oh, no, no, no.

42:39.120 --> 42:41.407
- Don't change it. I love this song.
- Me too.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.126
What? I didn't even like this song
when it was popular.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.731
Come on, loosen up, David.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.407
<i>Please stick to the rivers</i>

42:50.600 --> 42:52.762
<i>And the lakes that you're used to</i>

42:53.000 --> 42:54.047
Don't do this.

42:54.240 --> 42:57.608
What? This isn't even
a good victory song.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.842
No, stop. We are not doing this.

43:00.040 --> 43:03.169
This is embarrassing. Stop.

43:04.440 --> 43:05.726
Ah, come on.

43:06.800 --> 43:10.009
<i>I seen a rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone</i>

43:10.200 --> 43:12.407
<i>Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is 10 shades of gray</i>

43:12.600 --> 43:13.647
<i>What the fuck?</i>

43:14.520 --> 43:17.603
<i>I pray all 10 fade away
Seldom praise him for the sunny days</i>

43:17.800 --> 43:19.689
<i>You claim the insane
And name this place in time</i>

43:19.880 --> 43:23.282
<i>For fallin' prey to crime, I swear
The system got you victim to your own mind</i>

43:23.480 --> 43:26.484
<i>Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true</i>

43:26.680 --> 43:28.728
<i>Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and</i>

43:28.920 --> 43:31.651
<i>Don't go chasin' waterfalls</i>

43:31.840 --> 43:34.286
- Whoo!
- Whoo, yeah, Kenny!

43:34.480 --> 43:36.050
Where did you learn to do that?

43:36.240 --> 43:37.685
Yeah, whatever.

44:01.800 --> 44:02.847
<i>Señor Chacon.</i>

44:04.800 --> 44:06.529
We were not expecting you.

44:06.720 --> 44:10.645
I decided to bring the gringo myself
to make sure everything goes as planned.

44:10.840 --> 44:14.925
But the gringo has already left with the
shipment, señor.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.281
What gringo?

44:16.480 --> 44:18.448
The gringo with the haircut of a donkey.

44:19.360 --> 44:21.727
You mean this gringo
with the haircut of a donkey.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.000
I have failed you, señor.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.726
If you saw this gringo again would you
recognize him?

44:27.080 --> 44:29.924
He was driving an RV with his family.

44:30.280 --> 44:31.691
Get in the car.

44:53.720 --> 44:55.688
Oh, how fast are you going?

44:56.640 --> 44:59.564
Calm down, I'm going the speed limit.
We won't get pulled over.

44:59.800 --> 45:03.600
No, no. I mean, loaded down like this
in a 15-ton vehicle...

45:03.840 --> 45:06.161
...going up a 10 percent grade.

45:06.760 --> 45:10.890
Just use your head, David.
I don't think you think things through.

45:11.080 --> 45:14.562
- What?
- Weight distribution loading and towing.

45:14.760 --> 45:15.921
- See?
- Yeah, I do.

45:16.120 --> 45:17.451
I thought this plan through.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.881
- Seems to be working out.
- Oh, great.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.485
Oh, Shit!

45:25.760 --> 45:27.524
Seriously. God...!

45:35.120 --> 45:37.088
Was this part of your plan, David?

45:37.280 --> 45:38.361
Damn it.

45:38.760 --> 45:41.570
- Wait, what are we gonna do now?
- I don't kno...

45:41.800 --> 45:43.040
I can't even get a signal.

45:43.840 --> 45:46.491
No shit. We're in the fucking middle of
nowhere, dude.

45:46.720 --> 45:48.370
Oh, gee, thank you, Casey.

45:48.560 --> 45:51.166
Thank you for your amazing problem
solving skills. So helpful.

45:51.360 --> 45:52.646
Whoa. Hey, what are you doing?

45:52.840 --> 45:56.287
I'm not gonna stand on the side of the
road next to an RV filled with pot.

45:56.520 --> 45:57.806
I'm gonna try to find help.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.163
- Yeah, fuck this. I'm going with her. Bye.
- What?

46:01.400 --> 46:04.006
- Wait up!
- Ugh. Ridiculous!

46:04.640 --> 46:08.247
Okay. Actually, that's fine. Good idea.
Okay, hurry back though, please.

46:08.440 --> 46:11.887
"Oh, I have a plan." Really? Good plan.
You don't have any plans.

46:14.520 --> 46:15.806
Women, am I right?

46:16.880 --> 46:18.530
Shut the fuck up, Kenny.

46:20.760 --> 46:24.401
And he's so smug. Ugh.
He drives me crazy.

46:24.600 --> 46:25.931
Well, yeah, he's an idiot.

46:26.120 --> 46:28.487
No, he's not an idiot.
He's actually kind of smart.

46:28.720 --> 46:29.926
Why are you defending him?

46:30.120 --> 46:32.327
I'm not defending him.
I'm just saying that he...

46:32.520 --> 46:36.286
Have you seen where we are?
This whole plan is so stupid.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.646
Oh, really?

46:37.840 --> 46:41.128
What golden advice did you follow that
ended with you on the streets?

46:41.360 --> 46:44.648
I don't live on the streets, okay?
I crash with friends.

46:44.840 --> 46:46.922
Ah. Okay. I see.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.885
So you were kind of between
couches when David and Kenny found you.

46:50.080 --> 46:52.242
Are you gonna lecture me?
Seriously, I'll puke.

46:52.440 --> 46:54.169
You know what, I'm not lecturing you.

46:54.360 --> 46:57.011
Okay, good. Because I don't
need advice from a stripper.

46:57.200 --> 46:59.240
All right, you know what you little shit?
I swear...

47:00.360 --> 47:01.771
What the hell is this?

47:03.160 --> 47:05.970
Well, look at this
cute little couple of hitchhikers.

47:06.160 --> 47:07.571
We're here to save your bacon.

47:07.800 --> 47:10.246
Saddle up, little ladies. Ha-ha-ha!

47:10.440 --> 47:12.442
Hey. Hi, what's going on?

47:12.680 --> 47:16.241
They pulled up right after you guys left.
They're gonna tow us to a mechanic.

47:16.440 --> 47:18.363
They keeping asking to hold
the weed baby.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.921
All right, all right, calm down. Okay.

47:21.120 --> 47:24.602
Just calm down, all right? I got this.
Watch.

47:25.600 --> 47:27.443
I'm holding that baby.

47:27.640 --> 47:30.769
Edie, you will, I promise,
but it's nap time for LeBron.

47:30.960 --> 47:32.041
Come on, guys, let's go.

47:32.280 --> 47:35.409
All aboard the Fitzgerald Express.
Honk, honk!

47:35.600 --> 47:38.080
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Toot, toot!

47:39.120 --> 47:41.566
It's like we're pretending it's a train,
but it's not.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.530
- Surrounded by goblins.
- Okay.

47:50.760 --> 47:51.966
Oh, Oh, Oh!

47:52.160 --> 47:54.766
One more sec, okay? Hold on,
one second. Don't freak.

47:54.960 --> 47:56.680
When you're a synchronized swimmer...

47:56.840 --> 47:59.081
...you can't use a maxi pad,
you can see it.

47:59.280 --> 48:01.123
So my friend bought me a box of tampins.

48:01.320 --> 48:03.846
And I'll tell you, I had
a hard time inserting those.

48:04.040 --> 48:06.122
- It would just stick halfway out.
- Mm-hm.

48:06.360 --> 48:08.280
- It was just like a Roman candle.
- Mm-hm.

48:08.440 --> 48:11.569
And that is how I found out
I was born with a shallow vagina.

48:13.360 --> 48:17.570
- That was such a detailed story, Edie.
- Thank you!

48:17.760 --> 48:22.448
You gotta do a one-woman show.
It's, like, so many layers, you know?

48:23.480 --> 48:25.687
So, what's your story, David?

48:25.920 --> 48:27.729
- What do you mean?
- How'd you two meet?

48:27.960 --> 48:30.486
Ah! Honey, tell her.

48:30.680 --> 48:33.251
And don't leave out
any of the romantic parts.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.931
Okay. All right.

48:35.120 --> 48:37.248
Where did we first meet. Um...

48:37.440 --> 48:38.805
It's great.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.641
Well, that would have been when Rose
moved into my apartment building.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.683
- Ah. That's right.
- Mm-hm.

48:46.280 --> 48:49.443
I remember watching her through the
crack in my door as she was...

48:49.640 --> 48:50.926
Wait, you were spying on me?

48:51.120 --> 48:53.885
Now, hon, just because you've heard it
a thousand times...

48:54.080 --> 48:56.287
...doesn't mean you should interrupt.
Don't be rude.

48:56.840 --> 48:59.002
All right. Proceed.

48:59.840 --> 49:01.410
But, yeah, I was spying on her.

49:01.600 --> 49:03.967
She was unloading this U-Haul
all by herself.

49:04.400 --> 49:08.485
I wanna go help her, but I don't wanna come
off like I'm hitting on her, because...

49:09.080 --> 49:11.924
...you know, I'd like to hit on her
maybe at some point.

49:13.120 --> 49:15.282
And, uh...

49:15.480 --> 49:20.884
...she was wearing these little navy
blue Chuck Taylors and these jean shorts.

49:21.080 --> 49:23.606
No pockets on the back,
however that happened.

49:23.800 --> 49:27.043
And this, uh, Tom Waits T-shirt.

49:27.240 --> 49:28.969
I was like, "Oh, that's cool."

49:29.160 --> 49:30.685
Because I love Tom Waits.

49:30.880 --> 49:32.803
And she just looked beautiful.

49:37.840 --> 49:40.002
If you're into that kind of mean,
pretty thing.

49:42.560 --> 49:43.607
So, anyway, uh...

49:43.800 --> 49:48.488
...she starts to bring up this really big
weird-looking painting up the stairs.

49:48.680 --> 49:52.526
And I'm like, "Okay, here's my shot."
All right, so I go outside...

49:52.720 --> 49:56.042
...and I help her with it.
I'm trying to, at least.

49:56.240 --> 49:57.969
She looks at me and goes: "Stop it!"

49:58.160 --> 50:00.527
- She just snaps at me.
- You started yanking at it.

50:00.760 --> 50:02.683
Next thing you know, it's a tug of war...

50:02.880 --> 50:05.087
...pulling it back
and forth and out of nowhere...

50:05.280 --> 50:08.443
His fat fist
goes right through the canvas.

50:08.640 --> 50:11.803
- But it was an accident.
- Doesn't matter! You ruined my painting.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.924
Okay. Honestly, I really think
you should've thanked me.

50:15.120 --> 50:17.202
Yeah, because that painting
was hideous.

50:18.760 --> 50:21.331
My grandfather painted that painting.

50:21.520 --> 50:24.330
And it was my favorite thing
in the entire world.

50:25.720 --> 50:28.690
So we get in this screaming
match in front of the whole building.

50:28.920 --> 50:31.207
And everybody comes out
and is watching it.

50:31.480 --> 50:33.608
I mean, from that moment,
we hated each other.

50:33.840 --> 50:35.285
Oh, man.

50:36.600 --> 50:40.366
- And then you fell in love. Oh!
- Yeah. Then we fell in love.

50:40.560 --> 50:44.610
- Ha, ha!
- Hey, now. I think this is our exit.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.280
David, could you grab me the map
out of the glove box?

50:47.800 --> 50:49.131
Yes, sir.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.611
- Whoa. Whoa. Uh...
- Whoa!

50:52.800 --> 50:55.770
Oh, hey, sorry about that, buddy.
Didn't mean to scare you there.

50:55.960 --> 50:57.803
That's just my service pistol and badge.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.082
Oh. Your badge.

51:00.680 --> 51:03.126
- Are you a cop?
- No, no, no.

51:03.320 --> 51:04.970
No? Oh, God.

51:06.080 --> 51:07.286
- I'm in the DEA.
- Oh.

51:13.240 --> 51:16.130
Yeah, my Don has been an agent for the
last 22 years.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.004
On a bit of a hiatus at the moment.

51:18.200 --> 51:21.090
They took him out of the field,
he wasn't aggressive enough.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.487
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry. It's not right, Don.

51:23.720 --> 51:26.769
Those young guns aren't half the
agent you are, those crumb-bums.

51:26.960 --> 51:29.486
Edith, you know how I feel
about your cussing.

51:29.680 --> 51:32.889
- I'm sorry, Don.
- Edith can be a little hot-blooded at times.

51:33.080 --> 51:35.890
- I'm 1/8 Italian, so...
- Oh. It's okay.

51:37.040 --> 51:40.840
Uh, hey, if you guys will excuse me.

51:41.040 --> 51:42.849
- Wanna join me?
- Where are you off to?

51:43.040 --> 51:45.361
- We're gonna check on the baby.
- Gonna take a dump.

51:45.560 --> 51:47.927
- Check the baby's dumps.
- That's what we should say.

51:48.160 --> 51:51.209
- Yeah, just go check on Lebanon.
- LeBron. His name's LeBron.

51:51.400 --> 51:55.007
He just has a terrible tummy.
And it's just bad diarrhea stuff.

51:55.200 --> 51:56.531
Do we still have cornstarch?

51:56.720 --> 51:58.961
Yeah, there's
cornstarch for his bottom.

51:59.160 --> 52:00.844
- Family meeting.
- Yep.

52:01.840 --> 52:03.683
I'm getting my hands on that baby.

52:06.160 --> 52:08.322
He's a narc?
Are you fucking kidding me?!

52:08.680 --> 52:12.002
Stop panicking! We haven't done anything
suspicious yet, so just relax!

52:12.280 --> 52:15.648
Oh, really? Okay. What about when they
wanna hold our precious weed baby?

52:15.840 --> 52:17.171
Give me the baby, all right?

52:17.400 --> 52:19.721
I'll handle it if it happens.
I'll take care of it.

52:19.920 --> 52:23.481
Right now, all we have to do is
get away from that fucked up family.

52:23.840 --> 52:25.490
Oh, fuck. Why are we stopping?

52:25.680 --> 52:29.162
They heard us. They heard us.
Fuck, we're going to jail.

52:31.880 --> 52:34.042
No, no, no.
We're just at the garage, okay?

52:34.240 --> 52:37.210
Everybody calm down. We haven't
done anything. You're right.

52:37.400 --> 52:40.927
I'll ditch this guy real fast. We're gonna
get in and get out of here, okay?

52:41.120 --> 52:43.771
Game face, okay?
Miller time. Here we go.

52:45.080 --> 52:46.684
No other repair shops nearby?

52:46.880 --> 52:51.010
Run by a Christian and open after
supper on a Saturday night? No, sir.

52:51.280 --> 52:54.887
Ah, shoot. I'd give you the hose out
of our rig and send you on your way...

52:55.080 --> 52:56.764
...but we'd be stranded ourselves.

52:57.240 --> 53:00.164
Besides, this way we can all get to
know each other better.

53:00.440 --> 53:02.727
- What's happening?
- They're closed till morning.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.531
Oklahoma.

53:05.240 --> 53:06.287
Oh, God.

53:06.480 --> 53:09.086
You folks can make camp with the
Fitzgeralds tonight.

53:09.280 --> 53:13.330
I know a great spot. We'll set up the old
tents and you can bed down in our Winni.

53:13.520 --> 53:16.126
- I'll give you a hand with your gear.
- No, no, no.

53:16.320 --> 53:18.368
That's okay.
Millers carry their own weight.

53:18.640 --> 53:21.564
- I knew I liked you, David.
- Kenny, you wanna get our shit?

53:22.360 --> 53:24.601
- Hey.
- This will be a hoot.

53:25.080 --> 53:28.289
I'll watch your little one so you and your
man can have some snuggle time.

53:28.480 --> 53:30.960
- I don't want you to have to...
- I am good with babies.

53:31.160 --> 53:33.561
Nonsense! Oh, give me the baby.
Give me that baby!

53:45.000 --> 53:46.047
Shit!

53:47.480 --> 53:48.527
Oh, my God!

53:49.720 --> 53:51.768
Oh, my God!

53:52.440 --> 53:55.649
Oh, my God.
Why isn't there blood?!

53:55.840 --> 53:58.730
Oh, my God! What's happening?

53:58.960 --> 54:02.931
Thanks a lot, Mom. Now what am I
supposed to use for my health project?

54:03.120 --> 54:05.361
I'm gonna fail and have to go to
community college.

54:05.560 --> 54:08.131
- My future's ruined!
- Honey.

54:08.480 --> 54:10.323
Mrs. Fitzgerald, are you all right?

54:10.520 --> 54:13.842
- That baby was...?
- Oh, did you think that LeBron was...?

54:14.040 --> 54:17.886
Heh-heh-heh.
- No, no, no. LeBron was a sack of herbs.

54:18.080 --> 54:19.684
Oregano and basil mostly.

54:19.880 --> 54:22.611
We were just treating it like
a real baby, a summer project.

54:22.800 --> 54:25.121
- Extra credit.
- It teaches the students that...

54:25.360 --> 54:27.000
...nothing ruins your life like children.

54:27.680 --> 54:31.162
Yeah. And it also sends that message
to teens, just stick to the big A.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.169
- Yeah, anal.
- Abstinence, you meant.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.243
- Neither makes a baby.
- He confuses them.

54:37.040 --> 54:39.850
Anyway, I'm so sorry, Edie.
We promised our Casey...

54:40.080 --> 54:43.641
...that we would treat it like a real baby
all summer and we went too far.

54:43.880 --> 54:44.927
Got used to it. Sorry.

54:45.120 --> 54:46.681
And so I'm embarrassed, actually.

54:46.880 --> 54:48.530
I think that would scare anybody.

54:48.760 --> 54:52.048
She's very emotional. You should have
seen her at the end of <i>Free Willy.</i>

54:52.240 --> 54:53.446
Oh, stop it, Don.

54:55.880 --> 54:57.291
I love that whale.

54:57.680 --> 55:00.126
Well, who loves campfire games?

55:00.280 --> 55:02.123
Oh, Don.

55:04.840 --> 55:07.081
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my pleasure to welcome you...

55:07.280 --> 55:10.409
...to the annual
singing Fitzgerald family jamboree.

55:11.400 --> 55:13.368
Our usual guests couldn't
be here this year.

55:13.760 --> 55:17.207
- Uh, they're called the Osmond family.
- Ha-ha-ha!

55:19.800 --> 55:25.204
But in their place this year we have the
very talented and wonderful Miller family.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.801
Let's get this party started
with a Fitzgerald family favorite.

55:30.400 --> 55:33.244
<i>Breakin' rocks in the hot sun</i>

55:33.400 --> 55:39.760
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

55:39.920 --> 55:41.251
It always does.

55:41.440 --> 55:44.728
<i>I needed to steal some money
'Cause I had none</i>

55:44.880 --> 55:47.167
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

55:47.360 --> 55:48.407
Now just the Millers.

55:48.560 --> 55:52.042
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

55:52.240 --> 55:55.722
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

55:56.680 --> 56:00.685
I want you to imagine you committed a felony,
you've been tried and sent to prison...

56:00.840 --> 56:04.561
...and you're standing out in the sun
breaking up rocks with a sledgehammer. And...

56:04.720 --> 56:07.644
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

56:07.840 --> 56:10.650
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

56:10.840 --> 56:12.719
- All right, that's great.
- That's good.

56:12.720 --> 56:15.166
- That's fun. Great song.
- I love it. That was great.

56:15.320 --> 56:16.890
Great choice.

56:17.040 --> 56:20.362
- Great, kids.
- Well, that was an A for effort.

56:20.560 --> 56:23.166
- Whoo! I got the spirit!
- That's great.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.600
<i>It's a bird, it's a plane.</i>

56:24.720 --> 56:27.724
- U.S. Air Force, U.S. Air Force. Ollie North!
- Take me home to...

56:27.880 --> 56:29.291
Looks like a sea animal.

56:29.720 --> 56:30.846
Hammer tooth shark.

56:31.040 --> 56:35.602
We wait until they fall asleep and then
we sneak into their tent, all right?

56:35.800 --> 56:37.723
Mm. Cut their throats.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.369
- What?
- What?

56:40.560 --> 56:42.369
No. Jesus.

56:42.680 --> 56:44.569
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

56:44.760 --> 56:48.242
I wasn't saying to do that. I didn't say that.
I thought you were gonna it.

56:48.440 --> 56:50.841
You thought I was gonna say
"cut their throats"?

56:51.280 --> 56:53.681
Who do you think I am, Scarface?
Give me a break.

56:53.880 --> 56:55.760
- Herbert Walker Bush!
- Paper airplanes!

56:56.320 --> 56:57.651
Clowns. Clown sandwich.

56:57.840 --> 56:59.444
Don't lock the baby in the basement.

56:59.680 --> 57:02.729
What I was gonna say: We sneak
into the tent, steal Don's keys...

57:02.920 --> 57:06.686
...then we take the RV back to the shop and I
can swap out their radiator hose for ours.

57:06.880 --> 57:08.928
Ah. Got it.

57:09.120 --> 57:11.885
- The Earth! The Earth is on fire!
- Atmosphere.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.366
Uh...

57:13.560 --> 57:14.686
Plain and simple.

57:14.880 --> 57:16.484
AI Qaeda! AI Qaeda!

57:18.400 --> 57:19.640
It was "plain and simple."

57:19.840 --> 57:25.131
- See, this was a plane, and then this w...
- Oh, Melissa, of course it was.

57:25.480 --> 57:26.720
That is so clever.

57:26.960 --> 57:28.689
Gosh, I thought it was really good.

57:29.400 --> 57:31.243
I'm a terrible drawer, so...

57:32.440 --> 57:34.329
- Great, because you're up next.
- Ah.

57:36.280 --> 57:38.408
- Passing the baton.
- Nice work.

57:38.640 --> 57:40.441
Okay. Let's go, Kenny.

57:40.640 --> 57:42.369
All right, Kenny, here we go.

57:42.600 --> 57:44.887
- Draw your brains out.
- All right, that's a line.

57:45.080 --> 57:47.242
- A slash. Guns and Roses.
- Looks like a spring.

57:47.480 --> 57:50.529
What is that? That's a... Kenny,
come on, draw something, buddy.

57:50.720 --> 57:51.846
- String.
- Come on, son.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.566
- Rocket. It's a rocket or...
- Is that a cucumber?

57:54.760 --> 57:56.046
This is really stupid.

57:56.280 --> 57:58.886
Is it a bad drawing, Kenny?
My guess is "bad drawing."

57:59.400 --> 58:02.643
- It's...
- Oh! A penis! A penis.

58:03.200 --> 58:06.249
It's a big dick. Those are balls.

58:06.440 --> 58:09.649
It's a big black dick! It's a drawing.
Black! It's a big black dick.

58:10.600 --> 58:12.887
It's a big, big black cock!

58:13.640 --> 58:14.801
<i>Black Cock Down!</i>

58:19.960 --> 58:21.200
It's a skateboard.

58:21.480 --> 58:24.245
- It's a skateboard, great.
- A skateboard. Of course it is.

58:24.440 --> 58:27.364
- It's a big black skateboard.
- I see it.

58:27.600 --> 58:30.604
Of course. It's very clear.
But, you see, it was up... There's...

58:30.800 --> 58:34.043
Its wheels, so I didn't see it
down on the ground, and then it...

58:37.920 --> 58:40.651
<i>Black Cock Down? Black Cock Down?</i>

58:40.840 --> 58:43.491
Nice job, Meryl Streep.
Very subtle character work.

58:43.680 --> 58:45.682
Not my fault that Kenny can't draw.

58:45.880 --> 58:47.564
Don't you pick on Kenny.

58:47.760 --> 58:50.161
Nothing about that
looked like a skateboard.

58:50.360 --> 58:53.204
You leave him alone.
Where the hell's Kenny?

58:53.400 --> 58:55.482
- You guys, come here.
- What?

58:55.680 --> 58:57.364
- What's going on?
- Look at these two.

58:57.560 --> 58:59.403
- Aww.
Uh-oh.

59:02.160 --> 59:04.811
- Guess I'm not the best drawer.
- No, you were great.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.048
- I knew that was a skateboard.
- Yeah.

59:07.400 --> 59:10.324
- I don't know where the confusion was.
- No, I... That...

59:10.640 --> 59:12.130
Yeah.

59:13.040 --> 59:16.089
I, um, really like your family.
They're, uh...

59:16.320 --> 59:19.881
- They're different.
- Well, they're not my family. I mean...

59:20.080 --> 59:21.570
Yeah, no, I get what you mean.

59:21.760 --> 59:23.683
- She wants him to kiss her.
- Absolutely.

59:23.880 --> 59:27.202
- She does, right?
- And sometimes I feel like I'm adopted...

59:27.400 --> 59:29.528
...or an alien, you know, or something.

59:29.720 --> 59:32.644
Right. That's what I meant. Um...

59:32.880 --> 59:35.406
But also, you know, I
would totally adopt you.

59:35.920 --> 59:37.126
You know, um...

59:38.640 --> 59:41.928
Not that I wanna be your daddy.
I just, uh...

59:42.400 --> 59:44.607
- He's talking too much.
- He won't shut up.

59:47.040 --> 59:48.326
Uh, well, good night.

59:50.560 --> 59:52.324
- I'll see you.
- Okay. Um...

59:52.800 --> 59:53.961
Fucking hug.

59:54.160 --> 59:55.241
Okay.

59:56.680 --> 59:57.727
And, uh, Melissa?

59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.604
- Yeah?
- Uh, watch out for bears.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.407
Um, you know. Can't see them coming.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.286
Good tip.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.850
That poor kid.
Well, you should go talk to him.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.486
Who?

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.321
I said you should go...
Well, who do you think?

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.403
Me? What the hell am I gonna say?

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.329
Talk to him about guy stuff.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.929
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Come on, how hard is it? Just go.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.170
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- Hey.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.402
- Anybody sitting here?
- Uh, no.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.649
Well, good, good, good, good.
All right.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.491
So, um...

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.524
...I saw what just happened
with you and Melissa.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.924
- Oh.
- Um...

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.802
You know, you don't have to be scared to
kiss a girl. Heh-heh.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.329
I mean, you damn near sucked a guy's dick
nine hours ago. What are you shy now for?

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.644
That's not funny, David.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.130
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.048
It was a bad joke. Ahem.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.085
You wanna know something I used
to do when I was your age...

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.487
...kept me from
getting nervous around girls?

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.443
- Yeah.
- I would just count to three.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.283
- Count to three?
- Yeah.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.571
- That's your big advice? Count to three?
- Yeah.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.970
I mean, if you ever wanna kiss a girl
or ask her to go out, or I mean...

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.687
Actually, if you get scared of anything,
just do this: just count to three...

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.251
...and then do it.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.762
Because if you take too long, you overthink
it and you'll just drive yourself crazy.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.803
Trust me, it'll change your life.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.924
I guess that makes sense.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.527
- Thanks.
- Yeah. No problem.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.122
And, you know, if you have any other
questions...

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.288
...about, like, the birds and the bees...

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.171
...who puts what into where,
any of that fun stuff...

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.006
...just don't hesitate to ask, okay?

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.287
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.040
- Good talk.
- Yeah, good talk.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.003
Oh, my back.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.927
- So old.
- Yeah.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.883
<i>Wait. You go in.
I'll keep a lookout, okay? Good.</i>

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.721
<i>Fuck you. This was your idea.
You're going the fuck in there.</i>

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.570
<i>Why are you yelling at me?</i>

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.808
<i>I am not yelling at you.</i>

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.446
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.560
<i>Watch.</i>

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.531
Bin Laden!

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.205
What's happening? Is it raccoons?

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.641
God.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.690
You were right about them, Edith.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.644
- No. I'm so sorry.
- Let me explain.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.251
This is completely explainable.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.721
- A misunderstanding.
- We didn't mean to do this.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.760
- You just have to understand something.
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.442
We have never done anything like this with
another couple before.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.651
Uh-huh.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.446
That's no judgment on you.
We're no squares.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.802
- I own a vibrator.
- That's right, she does.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.360
- Awesome.
- I wasn't for it at first.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:46.450
The darn thing's made in China,
for cripes' sake...

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:51.362
...but when you've been married this long
you look for anything to spice things up.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:55.406
So, of course we've discussed a scenario
like this.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.725
Yes. And tonight when you brought up
that big black "babymaker"...

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.848
- Well, we got it.
- Loud and clear.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.361
Our vibrator is named "Joe Morgan."

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.724
We were picking up
what you were putting down.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.048
- Same page.
- Interesting.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.330
We're very flattered by this, but right
now, in the middle of the night...

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.922
...I'm not sure I'm really ready for it.
Aw, Don.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.447
Got it. Totally understood. Not a problem.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.005
We just had to ask. So...

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.486
Wait. I have an idea.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:31.008
Okay. Maybe I could take
a baby step tonight.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.771
I mean, my mouth is for my marriage.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.924
But I've never touched
another woman before.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.328
I would be okay with that. Yeah.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.087
Oh, great.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.200
Rose?

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.487
- There you go.
- Okay. All right, I'm sitting.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.171
- Are you okay?
- David.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.370
- Mother to mother, is this okay with you?
- Yes. "Mother." Yes.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.881
- Are you sure?
- Let's get this mother started.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.521
- Shall we? Okay.
- Ha-ha-ha!

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.764
- Okay, Don, are you watching?
- I'm good.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.563
Okay. Uh, wow.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.411
My heart's pounding
so fast in my chest.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.251
- Ahem. So I guess we're swinging.
- Hmm? Oh, yeah.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.283
Ooh. Ha, ha.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.925
Sorry that I'm taking so long.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.202
Hello. Ha-ha-ha!

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.889
Okay, I'm just gonna do it real fast.
There we go.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.011
- There they are.
- There they are.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.488
- Wow! Wow!
- It's happening. This is happening.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.563
Don, are you looking at this?
I'm touching her boobs.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:35.008
- This is a miracle.
- Okey-doke.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.483
- Would you like to feel my breasts?
- I think that's enough for tonight.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.489
- You're right.
- Don't give away the farm.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.444
- A little roughhouse?
- We should wait.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.408
- Are you okay down there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.011
Have fun tonight, kids.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.285
- Awesome.
- I'm never gonna wash these hands.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.845
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.640
Thank you so much.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.080
- Good night. That was great.
- Okay, bye, guys.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.202
Great. What now, genius?

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.408
- Tell me... What?
- Oh, Oh, oh. I don't know.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.090
I just got earfucked in a tent.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.050
If you let her finger bang you
they would have given us the keys.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.965
Oh, really? Why don't you go
suck Don's dick for them...

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:13.329
...and then you get the keys?
He was certainly loving on those earlobes.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:16.882
Okay, look. First, unlike you, I only
suck a man's dick if I'm in love, okay?

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.724
That's kind of a personal rule I have.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.167
- Yeah, and secondly... And secondly...
- What?

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.289
I don't have a second one.
I don't know where I was going with that.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.329
Fucking idiot.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.883
Oh, I thought of one. I got one.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.048
Here comes Joe Morgan up to the plate.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.811
Oh, Don.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.481
Okay, what?

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:50.891
What? What do you mean?

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.445
Do you wanna talk about it...

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.405
...or mope around like
someone kicked you in the vagina?

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.323
Okay. Um...

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.568
Well, I've never really like...

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.922
Had sex before. Shocker.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.650
Kissed a girl before.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.608
Wait, what? I thought you said
you were like 18.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.401
- Okay, you know what, forget it.
- Okay, okay, wait. Okay.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.604
Come on. Sit down.
Don't need to be so dramatic.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.411
Look, it's okay
that you haven't kissed a girl.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.807
I'm sure there are some girls...

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.764
...who I've never met...

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.567
...that find inexperience
kind of sweet.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:30.163
I don't wanna be a sweet, inexperienced
guy who's never been worth kissing.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:35.648
I wanna be the guy who grabs a girl
and kisses her. You know?

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:41.445
Okay, let me make one thing clear.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.689
This isn't one of those moments
where the girl kisses the boy...

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.884
...and realizes she's been in love with him
the whole time, okay?

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.848
You're my fake brother
and you're a sweet kid...

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.560
...so this is for you
to bring back to Melissa.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.888
- What is?
- I'm gonna kiss you, dingus.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.245
Oh.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.491
- What are you doing? Shut your eyes.
- Okay, sorry. Right.

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.927
That's weird. That's really weird.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.168
- Sorry.
- All right. Ahem.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.962
That was okay.
Now more tongue.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.401
Tongue. I can do that.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.287
Too much tongue. Too much tongue.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:26.087
Right. Too much...
Yeah, that's my fault. My bad. Sorry.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.201
Less tongue.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:35.767
That was good.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.884
All right, now this time, I want you
to choke me a little bit.

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:44.051
- Uh, okay.
- Whoa. What's going on here?

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.729
Uh, it's...

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.844
- We're not doing what it looks like.
- Really?

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.731
It looks like Casey's
teaching you how to kiss out of pity.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.081
Mm-hm.

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:55.850
Uh, well, then it is what
it looks like, yeah.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.486
Really.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.285
What did you teach him?

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:02.404
The basics.
He's never kissed a girl before.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.531
You haven't?
Oh. Well, honey, show me.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.881
- Uh, really?
- Yes.

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:09.606
Okay. Uh...

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.447
Oh. Not bad.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.005
It's not bad.

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:18.163
- Try this.
- Okay.

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:19.441
Come here.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.046
There you go.

01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:28.203
You feel that?
What I did with my tongue?

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.169
- Yes, ma'am.
- Show Casey what you just learned.

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.410
Look at that.

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:40.680
Mm! Whoa!

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.120
Wait. Hold on.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:46.251
I wanna get a picture of you with the
first girl you ever kissed. Here you go.

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:47.965
- Mm-hm. Make it good.
- Good.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.090
Rose. Get in there.
There you go. Photobomb it.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.606
- This is getting better, it's getting better.
- Okay.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.125
It's so cute.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.521
Use your hands. They got
so much fun stuff to play with.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.290
You're not using your hands.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.730
Kenny?

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.281
- No, Melissa... It's, uh...
- I'm sorry.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.010
Melissa, wait.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.206
Fuck.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.324
You know, there's a 50-50 chance
she'll be into it.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.443
Redhead. They're crazy.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.565
Grab your things, guys.
Kenny, grab my stuff. Thanks.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.166
- Here we go.
- Well, looks like you're ready to roll.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:44.006
Gary called me first thing. He seemed real
eager for y'all to come pick her up.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.845
- Good. Good, good, good. Okay.
- Guess this is it, then.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.765
- Good luck to you, David.
- Hey, thank you, Don. Take care, will you?

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:53.481
Hey, yeah, listen, I would appreciate it
if you kept what happened last night...

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.967
...all that Chinese
vibrator talk, between us.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.169
- Yeah.
- If folks at my church found out about that...

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.927
Yeah. Oh, yeah. No, no. I get it. Yeah.
No, say no more. Mum's the word, okay?

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.201
Before you go running off...

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.681
- Yeah?
- Well, last night notwithstanding...

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.730
...things bedroom-wise between me
and Mrs. Fitzgerald...

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.963
- ...haven't been a real five-alarm fire of late.
- Okay.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.607
Now that I'm not working as much, we have
a chance to light the flame again...

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.684
- ...but our matches are wet.
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.083
- If you catch my drift.
- I do, yeah.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.083
Yeah, the matches are genitals. I get it.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.050
No, I was talking about our passion.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.282
Right. Sorry, sorry. Of course.
That's the way...

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.090
- That's okay. That's all right.
- Yeah.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.924
So we've been looking for new ideas...

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.084
...and she read on the internet
about this finger thing...

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.483
- Don, you don't need to share that with me.
- No, no, it's okay. I want to.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.210
Okay, as long as you're comfortable.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.925
- I need your advice, David.
- Mm-hm.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.050
You and Rose seem hotter for each other
than a couple mice...

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.282
...having sexual congress in a wool sock.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.365
- We do?
- Yeah.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.330
You're like newlyweds,
the way you keep looking at each other.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.400
- We are?
- Yeah. I guess I just wanna know...

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:02.521
...what do you do to keep things exciting
after years in the same fishing hole?

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.842
- Hmm.
- What's your secret?

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.406
Right.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.642
- And by fishing hole you mean...
- Genitals.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.080
That's genitals. Okay. Um.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.369
Yeah, um, my secret? Uh...

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.328
Well, you know what I do, Don?

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.126
I just treat
Rose like she's a stripper.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.050
- No kidding?
- No kidding.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.362
Like she's a dirty, dirty stripper.

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.124
Okay. Heh-heh-heh.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.765
Dirtier the better. Heh.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.082
- Heh, heh.
- Okay, watch your step.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.131
It surprise... It sneaks up on you.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.726
Everyone got your bags?

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.847
Oh. I am so sorry that Melissa
isn't here to say goodbye.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.681
She just won't come out of that bedroom.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.610
You know, she's been sick to her tummy
ever since last night.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.128
- I think it was something that she ate.
- Just tell her I'm really sorry.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.651
- Oh, sure.
- Oh.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.451
Sure will.

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.129
Oh, so sweet, kids.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.402
You'll always be my special lover.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.082
Ow! Oh, Edie.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.520
Bye!

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.564
- Happy birthday, America!
- Bye!

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.524
- See ya, now!
- Bye-bye, now.

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.564
- Thank you.
- Bye.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.560
Let's get out of here. You guys, go to
the RV. I'll get the keys from Skeeter.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.451
Hello?!

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.809
Hey, Brad, I was just gonna call you.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.208
Where are you?
Thought you'd be here by now.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.805
<i>I told you I needed it today.</i>

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.442
No, I know that. No, we just had a little
bit of engine trouble's all, okay?

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.929
We're gonna be on the road in five minutes,
at your front door in just a few hours, okay?

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.809
Nothing stopping us now.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.685
What the fuck?

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.410
Hand me the phone.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.961
Uh, Brad, can you hold on for a sec?

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.322
All right, let's not do anything rash.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.206
- I'm David, what's your name?
- Pablo Chacon.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.488
Shut the fuck up. Stop, stop.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.371
- Hola, Brad.
- Pablo!

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:11.051
You send this amateur fuck-up
to steal from me?

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.931
Listen, I don't know
what David told you... Hello?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.685
I would have loved to say good-bye to him.

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.927
Pablo Chacon.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.809
Turns out there's a real Pablo Chacon
and we stole from him.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.806
So this is probably gonna end well,
I would imagine.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.007
I'll be right back.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.567
No rush.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.489
I thought you said we were
picking up drugs for Pablo Chacon.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.291
I thought we were.
Brad told me he was Pablo Chacon.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.681
- Why do you trust that guy?
- I don't, okay?

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:52.167
Can you guys stop bickering
for five seconds?

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.482
Okay, how did he even find us?

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.130
- We don't know.
- I don't know.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.566
With this.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.524
Cool, is that a transmitter?
That's like a...

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.967
You put that in the RV, huh?
In one of the bags?

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:09.330
- How could you not think of that?
- Because I don't know what I'm doing!

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.807
- Have you not figured that out?
- Silence!

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.610
You all die now.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:19.081
But together as a family, with honor.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:24.203
But we're not even a real family, okay?
I don't even know these people.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.003
She's right. That's absolutely right. No, no.
We're not related at all, any of us.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.525
No. We're just friends.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.569
- No, we're not...
- We are not friends!

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.166
Look, I'm just a small-time
fucking drug dealer.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.685
I sell dime bags, all right?

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.487
My daughter here
is just a homeless gutter punk, all right?

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.890
And my son is just a fucking dork that
lives in my building. We don't look alike!

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.725
- Not related.
- A virgin, okay? And my "wife"?

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.969
I mean, she's just a cheap stripper.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.088
Hey, thanks, David. Nice.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.811
- We will not do anything if...
- Wait, wait. Heh.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.850
In the capri pants and the sensible
footwear, a stripper?

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.206
Yes.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.366
That's right, I am...

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.890
...Mr. Chacon.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.927
Just give me one chance...

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:13.206
...to prove to you that I'm worth
way more alive than I am dead.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:21.220
<i>Sweet</i>

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:25.940
<i>Emotion</i>

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.130
<i>Talk about things
And nobody cares</i>

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.007
<i>Wearing hot things
That nobody wears</i>

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:48.323
<i>Some sweat hog knew
She's a real good liar</i>

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.089
<i>'Cause the backstage boogie
Set your pants on fire</i>

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:01.765
<i>Sweet</i>

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:02.420
<i>Emotion</i>

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.180
<i>Sweet</i>

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.321
<i>Emotion</i>

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.410
<i>You stand in the front
Just a shakin' your ass</i>

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.609
<i>I'll take you backstage
You'll be drinking my glass</i>

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.369
<i>I'm talkin' about something
You can sure understand</i>

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.082
Have some respect, it's your mother.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.771
Get in the RV! Go, go, go!

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.487
Why are we fighting?

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.250
- Do you know how to drive this?
- No.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.520
No weapons. Here we go.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.882
- Hurry!
- I don't know how it works.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.851
Fuck!

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:52.291
- What just happened?
- I knocked him out. Let's go.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.641
- You did not.
- Yes, I did.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.245
Come on, Rose, come on. Come on!

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.006
- Look out!
- Oh, no, please.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.442
Kenny! Kenny, give me the wheel!

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.045
No, do not pull over!

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:18.051
Go this way!
No, no, no. Don't get on the freeway.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.686
- Kenny, just let me in.
- I can't. I'll stop.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.370
Don't stop! You can't stop.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.846
Goddamn it, will you let go?

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.963
No, no, no, no!
You're gonna get us killed!

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.691
- All right, just get out of the way.
- I can't.

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.841
Is everybody okay?

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.849
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. What...?

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.087
Fuck.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.370
Fuck!

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.166
Ow! Shit! Fuck, fucking...

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.482
Ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow!

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.450
- Oh, my God. Fucking shit! Fuck!
- What the hell is he doing?

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.728
Fuck a donkey! It hurts so much.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.201
Settle down, man.
What the hell's going on?

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.323
Oh, my God! I'm gonna die.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.482
Kenny, listen to me.
Calm down, all right?

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.483
Not gonna die. Tell us what's going on.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.211
- Tell us what happened.
- Fucking spider bit me, David!

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.931
- What? Where did it happen?
- Bit me on my balls.

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.922
On my fucking balls. On my balls,
on my fucking balls!

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.003
Oh, God. Let me see.
Kenny, let me see it.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.731
No. No fucking way. You're not seeing it.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.641
Come on. I can't help you unless you
show me. Sweetie, just show it to me.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:33.127
Kenny, will you just man up
and drop your pants?

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.964
We've all seen a dick.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:41.565
All right, let's see it.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:46.486
What? What is it?
What does it look like?

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.483
- I can't look.
- Um...

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.564
- Is it bad?
- Hey, listen to me. It's not that bad.

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.882
- Dude, it's really bad.
- No, it isn't.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:56.646
- Have you seen what that... Look.
- I'm not gonna look.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.963
- You're going to a hospital.
- What? No. No fucking way.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.321
How bad is it?

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.524
You're okay. Rub some dirt
on it. Let's get back in the RV.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.331
No. You're going to see a doctor.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.608
No fucking way.
No, absolutely not, Rose.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.371
He's not going to a hospital.
We don't have time.

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.727
Trust me. Kenny is fine.

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.406
I can't feel my bingo.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:22.484
- Goddamn it, Kenny.
- Yeah. Totally fine.

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:25.689
- Go grab him. Grab him!
- If he's dead, we're leaving him.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:36.485
Yeah, this is David Mille... David Clark,
calling for Mr. Gurdlinger again.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.204
Yes, I'll hold.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.404
Who's my big black and white baby? Yeah.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.168
You are. Yes, you are.

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.489
- Yellow-ski.
- Oh, hello, Brad.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.450
Where the fuck have you been?
I left you five messages, man!

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.491
David! You're alive! Cool.
How'd that happen?

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.444
Ask the real Pablo Chacon.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:02.005
<i>I'm not gonna make excuses.</i>

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.930
It was kind of a dick move.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.688
- "A dick move"? A dick move!
<i>- Little bit.</i>

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.570
Little bit of a dick move.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.451
Well, tell you what. I'm not driving
another fucking mile.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:15.764
<i>All right? I want goddamn hazard pay from
your ass. Otherwise, I'll turn around...</i>

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.891
...and give this smidge of pot back to
Chacon, along with your fucking address.

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.121
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:23.521
Sounds like you're
threatening to double-cross me.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.489
Fucking right I am.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.608
And I'm kind of turned on right now.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.966
<i>You make a good case for hazard pay.
How much you want?</i>

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.930
How much? Oh, I don't know,
half a million dollars.

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.366
<i>- How about that?</i>
- Done.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.244
Fucking right, it's done. Good.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.324
But I need it here by tonight
or the deal is off.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.610
No problem. That's fine with me.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.489
<i>Where the hell are you, anyway?</i>

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:50.726
We're at the Corrales Regional Medical
Center in Buttfuck, New Mexico.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.245
- Why?
<i>- Why? Why?</i>

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:56.001
Because this goddamn Kenny kid got his
fucking nuts bit by a giant spider.

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.403
That is amazing. Will you let me know
if he develops super powers?

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.082
Listen, man, giddyup, okay? Tick-tock.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.921
Tick-tock. Okay.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.961
Hola, Pablo. Es Brad.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:14.044
Okay. Here me out.
I wanna ask you something.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.844
Scottie? The doctor will see you now.

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.364
Text me, girl. I gotta bounce.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.206
Know what I'm saying?

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:36.002
Oh, God. Really? That guy?

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.371
- What? He's hot.
- Okay.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.206
"I gotta bounce."

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.323
- Miller family?
- Yeah.

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:47.240
Hi. Hello, how are you?

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:50.125
Oh, great. What's the news,
doc, huh? Can we get going?

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.084
- He's about to tell us.
- Oh, good.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:56.046
I'm afraid your son had a pretty severe
allergic reaction to the spider's venom.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.242
Ooh. Too bad. Better get him home.
Where is he?

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:02.525
He's in a lot of pain right now, we won't
be able to release him for a few hours yet.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.201
- Why?
- David? David, David! Stop it.

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.691
Please. Continue.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.449
Uh, he's on an IV
to get some antibiotics...

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:16.406
Who the fuck cares, man?
Okay? We got shit to do.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.649
Go get my son and bring him
and his giant nut out here right now.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:23.242
Stop it. Doctor, thank you.
I appreciate you taking care of our son.

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.081
- Thank you very much.
- Sure. You seem like a very caring father.

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:31.246
- What is your fucking problem?
- What?!

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.966
Are you crazy? It's only a few hours.
We'll be fine.

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.400
No, we're not fine. Okay?

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.570
We'll be dead in a few hours.
You forget who's following us?

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.121
Look, here's what I say we do, all right?

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.251
We leave him here,
and then we just keep going, all right?

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.364
So you're saying that the three
of us, we just leave him here.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.491
No! No, no, no. We don't leave him here.
No. Absolutely not. No, we leave...

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.085
...with him here.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.087
Okay.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.447
You know, if we leave Kenny here,
it really isn't...

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.167
Ah.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.091
No. I don't know where I was going
with that. That's stupid.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.566
Seriously.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.365
- What's that?
- I don't know.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.325
- Don't answer it! It's for me!
- What?

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.327
What's up, dawg?

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:22.330
Not much, dawg. What's up with you?

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.488
Here to pick up Casey,
know what I'm saying?

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.200
I'm awake and I speak English,
so, yeah, I do know.

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:31.569
- What's your name, man?
- Scottie P., you know what I'm saying? Ha-ha.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.124
Again, I do know what you're saying.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.800
But I appreciate you continuing
to check in with me.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.606
- Hi! Bye. We're gonna go.
- Whoa, wait!

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:42.041
- Where do you think you're going?
- Out.

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.682
I have just made lunch.

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.201
- When are you coming back?
- I don't know, later.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.289
No! Hey, stop! Stop, listen to me.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.289
Once Kenny is ready, we're out of here.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.962
We will leave with or without you.
If you're not here, we're gone. Got it?

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.242
Okay, fine. That's totally fine.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:00.364
Wait. Come here.
I'd like to have a chat with your friend.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.006
- Are you kidding me?
- I am not kidding you.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.611
Would you please have a seat.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.006
What is going on?

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.210
So, Scottie P.,
what exactly do you do for a living?

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.450
- Oh, Mom!
- I work for A & J Amusements.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.080
I'm rocking that Monkey Maze,
you know what I'm saying?

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.569
- What the hell is the Monkey Maze?
- Oh, it's like a Terrifying Deathtrap...

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.131
...but for little kids.

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.561
You're working at the fair. You're a carny.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:34.326
No, I drive a motorcycle.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.845
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.246
Yeah.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.325
What about you guys? Where you, uh,
stopping in from, you know what I'm saying?

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:43.482
- Uh, D-town.
- Oh, Detroit.

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.086
No, no, no. The other one.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.969
D-town. The other D-town.

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.487
- Denver...?
- That's the one. There you go.

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:52.080
- Colorado.
- That's the one.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.407
Yeah, I love my Rockies,
you know what I'm saying?

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.682
Oh, you like the Rockies?
You're a baseball fan?

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.967
- Uh, no, the mountains.
- Of course.

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.805
Hey, those are cool tats, man.

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.122
Oh, for real. Thank you, bro.
You see the cobra?

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.682
- What's this? The one right there?
- Oh, this?

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.285
Uh-huh.

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.363
That's my credo. "No ragrets."

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.410
Mm-hm. How about that.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.088
- You have no regrets?
- Nope.

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.881
- Not one?
- Nope. Ha, ha.

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:23.486
I wish I did. To talk about something.

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.721
Not one regret, huh?

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:27.082
That's how I been living my whole life.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.288
I went to a tattoo artist, I was like:

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.647
"This how I live.
Can you put that on my body?"

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.325
- And he did it.
- Dad.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:36.609
- Not even a single letter?
- No, I can't think of one.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.604
- I love all the letters, know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.808
A lot of letters in the alphabet.
How many?

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.930
- It's in the 20s.
- It's definitely in the 20s, I agree.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.560
Twenty-six, I think, if you count Y.

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.803
- Do you have any questions for us, Scottie P?
- Dad.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.444
- How did you make her so hot?
- What's that?

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:57.651
- Uh, Casey.
- Aw, that's very sweet of you.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.167
He wants to know
how we made Casey so hot.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:03.608
- It's, uh...
- You guys had to...

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.286
- What'd you ask us?
- ...seminate, like, each other?

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.283
Uh... Sorry?

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:11.159
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- Like, is there a way to make them, like...

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.286
...attractive? Like, kids?

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.602
- Doggie style. Know what I mean?
- Dope.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.240
- Dad.
- Well, I love him. I think he's great.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.125
A real winner.
If I were you, I wouldn't use protection.

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.805
Scottie P., you're the man.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.920
- Yo, for real. Thanks, man.
- We're leaving. Bye!

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:31.120
- Nice meeting you. You do you, Scottie P.
- You too.

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.329
Casey, make good choices!

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.004
Come on, she's gonna be fine.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.885
Tattooed kid on a motorcycle, no helmet.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.568
Actually, she might already be pregnant.

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.051
I cannot believe her.
Where the hell is she?

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:02.926
Look who is concerned about someone
other than themselves.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.088
What? I just want to get back on
the road.

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.645
No, I know.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.764
That kid was a dickhead, huh?

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.291
- Right?
- Know what I'm saying?

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:13.404
- Ha! Jerk.
- Unbelievable.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.921
Must get her shitty taste in men
from her mother.

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.721
I'm sorry. It was a cheap shot.

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.366
Cheap shot, okay? I'm taking it back.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.847
I'm sure your boyfriend Jimmy
is very nice.

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.884
He seems like a very good guy.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.841
Well, he's not. He left.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.642
Maxed out all my credit cards,
cleaned out my bank account...

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.251
...jetted out of town.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:45.002
He stole my favorite mug. Which was
a pretty shitty thing to do. Even for him.

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:47.646
- I'm really sorry about that. That sucks.
- Whatever.

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:50.804
That's what you get
for dating a guy who dates strippers.

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:52.407
Ah, come on.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.762
You're a lot more than that, Rose,
and you know it.

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.044
- What?
- Rose is not even my real name.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.331
What's your real name?

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:06.926
Sarah.

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:08.806
With an "h"?

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.481
Yep. Right there at the end.

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.250
It's the best way to spell it.

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:16.330
- That's what my mother thought. Heh.
- Heh.

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.209
Well, David's not my real name either.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:23.371
- Really?
- I'm being serious.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.331
Wow. So you're being ser...

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.564
Well, so then, what's your real name?

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:32.046
Barbara.

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:34.481
- Barbara?
- Yeah, named after my mom.

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.967
Oh, so, what are you, like, a Barbara Jr.?

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.322
- You're Barbara Jr.
- You got it. Yeah, yeah.

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:43.171
My friends in high school
and grade school called me Babs.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.885
Oh, scarred childhood.

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:49.045
Not really, not at all. I mean, I was in
musical theater, so I was actually revered.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.447
Very funny.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.850
You have a hair...

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.365
Yank, or put behind the ear?

01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:59.800
Guess we could...

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.766
...tuck it back there.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.962
Whoa. What's going on in here?

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.291
We should ask you the same thing,
young lady! Huh?

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.522
- We've been worried sick.
- That's right.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.882
Why are you guys talking like that?

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.281
Shit, is someone here?

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:19.450
Yeah! Yeah, us.
We're here. That's who's here.

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.206
We didn't know if you were dead
in a ditch! Huh?

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.040
You couldn't have called?
Something?

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.124
Or send one of those text messages
you're always sending out?

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:31.450
"Hey, it's me, Casey, I'm not dead in a
ditch." LOL, picture of a whale, #YOLO.

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.250
- Anything!
- Okay.

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.205
Fine! Whatever!

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.050
Sorry.

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.480
- Whoa!
- Thank you!

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.561
- Was that so hard?
- Appreciate that.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.883
- She learned a new word, Rose.
- Thank God. "I'm sorry."

01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.203
Un-fucking-believable.

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.005
It's gonna be great.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.048
Oh! There he is. Kenny!

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:53.720
- Okay, let's go.
- Oh, my God, you look so much better.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.161
- Doesn't he?
- Like a thousand bucks. Let's go.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.241
- Come on, we gotta hurry. Come on!
- Take it easy!

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.283
- Will you just relax?!
- Look, I can't...

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.167
- Oh, great.
- Aah!

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:07.806
- Kenny.
- That's my elbow. Oh...

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.247
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:13.091
Look what happens when you
run around like a crazy person.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:16.284
What do mean? He's fine.
Come on, Ken-doll, hop up. Here we go.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.562
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.406
- David!
- Look, this job has a deadline...

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.489
...and it's in four fucking hours.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.441
If you think I'm gonna lose half a million
dollars because of Kenny's boo-boos...

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.967
- ...then you're out of your mind.
- Whoa. Wait a second.

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:33.923
You're making half a million dollars
on this deal?

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:40.245
- Uh, roughly.
- I cannot believe you.

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:41.885
Listen to me. I can explain.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:47.291
You are making $500,000
and you were only gonna pay me 30?

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:51.041
You're getting 30 grand?
I'm getting a thousand!

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.085
Wait, you guys are getting paid?

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:54.725
- You're a liar.
- No, no, no.

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:57.042
- We want to renegotiate.
- No. No way.

01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:58.601
- What? David.
- No. No way.

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:02.930
You made your deal with me, I made my
deal with Brad. We're getting outta here.

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:07.248
See? Good. Casey gets it.
We're not renegotiating now. Let's go.

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:11.240
I believe we are, right now, because you
wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for us.

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:12.641
You're right about that.

01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:15.571
I'd be in Denver now if it wasn't
for you slowing me down.

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:19.162
Are you shitting...? Slowing you down?
What the hell are you talking...?

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:22.007
Whoa, where the hell are you going?
Hey, hey!

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.049
Hey, I said where are you going?

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:26.328
You know what? You leave,
you get nothing.

01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:27.965
I don't want your money, okay?

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:31.044
Casey, come back.
We have to stay together.

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.765
- Come on!
- Why?

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.965
Because we're a family? Huh?

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:38.404
You want to spend Christmas together?
Help me with my homework?

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:41.690
Please. This whole thing
has been a total joke.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:45.883
Oh, no, I'll tell you what the joke is!
You want to know what the...?

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.006
The j...

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.090
I'm not gonna tell you the joke!

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:53.489
You don't deserve to hear the joke!
Let's go.

01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:56.081
- I don't think you knew the joke.
- I knew a joke.

01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.964
We have to go back and get her.

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:00.686
What? Are you kidding me?
She left! Screw her, okay?

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.564
Are you coming with me or not, Rose?

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:07.442
Fine. I'll slide your check
under your door. Kenny, let's go.

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:10.725
Kenny, come on! Let's go, man.

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:13.526
We can't leave her, David. It's not right.

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.605
- You know what?
- What?

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.764
You all deserve each other.

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.011
Da... Wha...?

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.331
He'll come back.

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.087
Right?

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:00.367
Yo, girl!

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.567
- I got your text. What's up?
- Hey.

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.000
Are you alone?

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:10.411
Yeah. You think we can go someplace
private and talk?

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:14.727
I know just the spot,
you know what I'm saying? Heh-heh.

01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:23.164
- A little better.
- See, you're not in synch with what I'm doing.

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.284
I'm just playing a major scale,
but, um, we can move it down.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.726
- Let's move it.
- Shitty scale.

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.370
Stop talking. Just shut the fuck up.

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.005
<i>- Hey, what's up?</i>
- Hey, Brad.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:36.249
I'm just getting some singing lessons
from my main man Ben Folds Five.

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:39.802
- Ain't that right, Ben Folds Five?
- My name is Ben Folds.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.729
"Five" is the name of the band.

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:43.649
You're fucking with me. I love it.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.128
You gotta meet this guy.
Benji Five is a laugh riot.

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:49.160
<i>Remember that song "Brick"
we used to listen to?</i>

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:53.444
<i>She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly</i>

01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:56.405
<i>It's... I've got... It's that guy.
I fucking got that guy.</i>

01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.170
He's like my personal bitch.

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.607
- Listen, is everything okay?
- Yeah.

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.762
Yeah, yeah. Uh, things are fine.

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:05.890
I'm about 200 miles away.
I'll be there in three hours, all right?

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:09.567
- All right. Peace.
- Agh, fucking asshole.

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:11.051
Scales. Let's do this.

01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.605
This gig sucks.

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:14.808
Don't talk to me like that.
I will have you killed.

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:16.803
And no one will miss
your fucking nerd music.

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.164
<i>Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!</i>

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.010
Great. That's loud.

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:41.329
Yeah, nice try, radio. Nice try. Heh.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.764
Okay. Ahem.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.166
Let's get there.

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:49.569
Hoo.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.240
Quiet.

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:00.770
And I knew better too.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.321
But we were all on the road together...

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:06.330
...and it got kind of fun, you know?

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.207
Yeah. Uh-huh.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:11.644
And I started thinking of us as kind of
like this...

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.724
Whatever, it's stupid.

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:18.047
- Fuck them.
- Yeah, fuck them.

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:22.484
Yo, right now, girl, Scottie P. is gonna make
you feel real good, know what I'm saying?

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:25.047
- Ha-ha.
- Uh, heh.

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:28.369
I'm sorry, I'm just feeling kind of cry-ey
and that...

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:31.363
- I'm just gonna go, okay?
- Come on, girl.

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.881
- You texted me. You know what's up.
- Scottie.

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.320
Hey!

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:36.646
Get your hands off of her!

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.171
Come here, Casey.

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.204
You put your hands on her again...

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.085
...I will rip that fucking tattoo
right off of your chest.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.361
You know what I'm saying?

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.608
- Oh, really, bitch?
- Yeah, bitch.

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:49.883
You know what? Why don't you leave
the girls alone, man.

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.684
What are you gonna do, eyebrows?

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:54.685
One...

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:56.640
...two...

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.408
Ow! Broke my nose!

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.764
You're an aggressive woman.
Know what I'm saying?

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.287
Are you okay?

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:11.000
I'm fine. That was awesome.
You fucking decked him!

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:13.521
I've dealt with handsy
assholes like him at work.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.000
Let's just get out of here.

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:17.004
Thanks for the backup.
Why the counting?

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:19.447
If you're gonna punch someone,
punch them on one.

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.005
Well, David told me to count.

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:23.481
David? David hasn't punched
anybody ever.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.243
I think this Way. Exit.

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:36.691
I have returned.

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:40.807
Ha-ha-ha. So here's what happened, okay?

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:46.126
I'm out on the open road, just by myself, right?
And I'm just beelining it to a huge payday.

01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:48.681
And I start to realize something:
it's boring in here.

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:50.800
So I thought,
"You know what you gotta do, dummy?"

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:54.527
"You gotta turn this RV around
and go back and get those dip sticks."

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.923
Heh. I'm just kidding,
you're not dip sticks.

01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.889
What do you say we go home?
Come on, let's go.

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.849
Hey, David? Go fuck yourself.

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.289
Uh...? Ha!

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.360
"Go fuck yourself."
"You go fuck yourself."

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.048
Rose, you say, "Go fuck yourself." Then
Kenny's like, "I don't want to fuck anybody."

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:15.283
This is what I miss, right?
The Ping-Pong action, the repartee.

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:19.729
Come on, guys. Let's get out of here, go home.
Get in the RV, go home, get out of here.

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:22.201
Come on, let's go!

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:25.125
- Whoa, hey, hold on. Where you going?
- Are you serious?

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.203
Look, look, look. Okay.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.806
I know what this is about, and I get it.

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:33.009
All right?
We're gonna split the $500,000.

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:37.051
Evenly. Betwixt the four of us.

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:40.489
You guys get what I'm saying here?
Kenny, you wanna be like this: "Pfft!"

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.087
Like you're from... Right?
That's a lot of video games, kiddo.

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:47.642
All right, Casey, you can buy a house,
and run away from it.

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.520
You know what I mean? Like, whatever.
You get $125,000.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:51.806
You get $125,000.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.685
You get a... I mean, I'm like
fucking Oprah here. You know?

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:57.486
If she was a white dude at a carnival. Heh.

01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:00.211
Come on, guys. Let's get in the RV...

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.001
...and take our butts back to Denver where
we're gonna be rich and we're gonna get paid.

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:07.766
- Come on, come on.
- Uh, David, listen.

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:10.964
You misled us. You left us.

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:15.045
And then you come waltzing back in here all...
I don't know what the hell that was...

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:17.680
...and you just expect
that we all just forget about it.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.571
What's wrong with you?

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:22.447
How do we trust you?

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:29.404
Okay, look, what do you want?
Do you want me to beg?

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.170
Kids? What do you think?

01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:34.051
- That would make me feel a lot better.
- Works for me. Sure.

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.124
You're joking.

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:41.046
Wha...?

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.569
You really want me to get on my knees?
And beg you?

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.203
It's a good thing I'm wearing
my begging pants.

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.567
I usually only do this before sex.

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:53.845
Okay, okay, I'm going, I'm going.
Please, please.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.970
Ahem. Let's do it. Here we go.

01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:58.167
Okay! To the RV, let's go.

01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.607
Come on, Babs.

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:05.440
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.
There's clowns everywhere.

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.801
Here, let Pops get in here.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.287
We're right down here.
I parked it next to an RV.

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.486
- Melissa.
- Kenny.

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:17.250
- Rose!
- Edie.

01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:18.646
- Shit.
- Shit.

01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:21.201
I never get used to that language.

01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:26.171
What in the H-E-L-L
are you people doing here?

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.606
Uh... Uh, uh...

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:30.121
- We came to see the fireworks.
- Yeah. Fireworks.

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:34.810
Us too! That's so weird!
They're supposed to be amazing here.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.445
- Melissa, can we talk?
- No.

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:38.404
- Mom, come on, let's go.
- Melissa!

01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:40.882
Why are you being so rude?

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.686
Do you have your period?
Do you need a tampin?

01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:46.884
Mom, I don't need a tampin.
I don't want to be near these people.

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:49.248
- Kenny. Let's go.
- We should get out of here.

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.484
- What happened last night was wrong.
- Oh, boy.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.004
Oh, my God, she knows.

01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.802
My daughter knows what we've done.

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.043
Melissa, yes, it was wrong of me
to fondle Mrs. Miller's breasts.

01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:08.406
You're right. I'm not gonna deny that it
gave me a certain amount of pleasure.

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:13.726
That said, your father and I are struggling
with some serious intimacy issues.

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.046
Okay, no, stop!

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:16.765
I'm not as tight as I once was.

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:19.361
- Look...
- He just falls right out.

01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:21.608
It's like throwing a hot dog
down a hallway.

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:23.962
Ew! What are you talking about?

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:28.484
I saw Kenny making out with his sister
and mother while their dad watched.

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:31.410
What? Oh, my...!

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:34.729
- It wasn't quite like that.
- That's not exactly what happened.

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.850
Rose isn't my mom, she's not
my sister. We're not a real family.

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.208
That's enough, son!
What are you saying?

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.449
He's been drinking. It's hard
to understand. He's being ridiculous.

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.325
David hired us to help him smuggle drugs
across the border.

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.010
You're drug dealers?

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:51.370
No! No, we're drug smugglers.
There's a difference.

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.170
There's not a difference.

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.125
Okay, Edie, we can explain, all right?

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.687
This is a small misunderstanding.
It really is.

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:01.486
When he says "smuggle," he doesn't
know what he's saying.

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:03.921
- It's not drugs.
- He doesn't know what drugs are.

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.088
Seriously. It's just a little tequila.

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:08.641
What?

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:09.887
Oh, my God!

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:13.806
- Hey. Ah, thank God you're alive.
- He's got a gun!

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:16.202
Listen! Hey, hey, hey.
No, no! Wait, wait, wait!

01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.291
This is gonna be fun!

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.210
I still got it.

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.084
Don's a badass.

01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:42.007
Oh, Don.

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.644
Melissa, go find a police officer.

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:48.810
Okay, Don. Don, listen to me.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.401
No. Drug smuggling, David?

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.568
And to think of the moment we shared.

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.205
No, Don, there's another guy.

01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.484
I don't want to hear about other men!

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.522
What? No! No, no! No! There's
another guy trying to kill us!

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.131
What? Who?

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.481
Pablo Chacon.

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.167
Pablo Chacon.

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:07.486
<i>Buenas noches,</i> Millers.

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:09.364
What is he saying?
What does that mean?

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.289
It's a familiar Mexican greeting.

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:14.643
You in the short jeans
and the funny mustache, give me the gun.

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.126
Melissa.

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.081
And the mug.

01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.320
Please don't hurt her.

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:29.050
- Take her.
- Are you okay? It's okay.

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:33.926
Now the keys, please.

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.606
Here. Here, here, here.

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.163
Okay, great. You have your drugs,
so you don't have to kill us.

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.124
Oh, I don't have to kill you, huh?

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.407
You take my drugs.

01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:45.570
You make me cross the border into
this fucked-up country.

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.922
You try to burn my face with steam!

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:50.407
- I'm sorry.
- You destroy my car!

01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.006
And I don't like what you do to my man
every time we meet.

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.402
You are the worst family I've ever met.

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.242
But, you're right, I
don't have to kill you.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:09.167
I want to kill you. All of you.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.403
Stop. Stop.

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:15.930
Don't do this. Don't kill these people.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.607
This is all my fault. I'm the one that
did this. I'm the drug dealer here.

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:22.165
This is an innocent family...

01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.601
...in the wrong place
at the wrong time. Okay?

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:27.206
And this kid?

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:30.649
This kid's got the biggest fucking heart
I've ever seen in my life.

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:33.130
And I'm lucky to call him a friend.

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:37.286
Man, an hour ago, I would have killed
this girl for you.

01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:40.609
But she's tough as hell.
And a lot smarter than me.

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.166
And this one.

01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:47.491
You. Sarah.

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.727
You're the strongest woman
I've ever met.

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:52.684
And you'd make a great mom.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.845
I love all of them.

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:00.160
Don't kill them.

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:01.926
Please.

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.451
Just kill me.

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.806
- Tell you what, I'll make a deal, okay?
- Okay.

01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:10.407
I kill you first so you don't
watch your family die.

01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.005
David.

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:33.563
Kenny! That was amazing!

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:42.089
I'd like to think I taught him that.

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:45.326
- Mm.
- I know I taught him that.

01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:49.088
Put that tongue back in your mouth,
young man.

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:52.120
Oh.

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.163
Wow.

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.886
- You kiss a lot better than my sister.
- Hey!

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:00.326
- One, two, three.
- Mm-hm.

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:13.691
Well, Mr. Chacon, on behalf
of the United States of America...

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:15.928
...I'd like to welcome you to our country.

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:17.531
Grab a seat.

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:20.927
Sorry you won't get to experience
the freedom part.

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:23.368
Don, you're my hero.

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:29.163
I want you to use those zip ties tonight.

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:44.167
Here.

01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:46.246
Thank you, David.

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:51.167
- We're gonna go.
- Not so fast.

01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:52.606
- Oh, no, Don.
- Dad, please.

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.245
Girls, hush.

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.929
I believe that you are good people.

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.282
But you broke the law. All of you.

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:05.007
And worse than that, you put my wife
and daughter's lives in danger.

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:08.404
- Sorry.
- Gonna have to place you under arrest.

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:09.840
- Don, why?
- No, Dad, don't.

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.525
And I'm gonna do just that...

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.369
...right after I turn around...

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:16.566
...and hug my family.

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:30.685
David, come on.

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:39.686
It's all here!

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.560
I am blown away, David. Great job.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.162
But it's late.

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.524
Deadline was last night, so,
sorry, buddy, no deal.

01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:52.484
Brad, I almost got killed
over this shit. Twice.

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:56.480
I'm not gonna be an asshole about this.
I got two tons of premium weed.

01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.526
Yes! And you got Chacon
pinched in the process...

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:03.843
- ...which is a huge win for team Brad.
- Mm-hm.

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:07.169
So how about we shake hands
and call it even.

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.811
- You were never gonna pay me, were you?
- Oh! Bingo. Heh-heh.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:17.361
Was that a dick move?
I can't even tell anymore.

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:22.404
- Move!
- Go! Go! Go!

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.441
- Down, down, down!
- Get on the ground! Freeze!

01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.050
Clear!

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:34.481
You double-crossed me.

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.370
Kind of a dick move, right?

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:39.010
You got nothing on me!

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.691
Nothing at all.

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:44.251
Oh, shit! Look at this guy.

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.329
Who let in 50 Cent?

01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:50.082
- Nice work, David.
- Thank you, Don.

01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:52.328
Now, I know you don't get your money...

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.689
...but doing the right thing
had to feel a whole lot better.

01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:57.491
No.

01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:59.445
All right, maybe a little bit.

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:04.089
As promised, in exchange for your
testimony against Chacon and Gurdlinger...

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:07.563
...we have to keep you in witness
protection for three to six months.

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:10.206
- Just me?
- Just you.

01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:16.651
Oh. And any other witnesses to the crime.

01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:29.244
- <i>There you are.</i>
<i>- I don't care.</i>

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.560
- Look at this hot nerd.
- Rub some dirt on it.

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:33.170
- What are you doing?
- Look at this.

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:39.206
You gotta tell Casey to stop posting this stuff.
It's already got a million hits...

01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:40.766
...and growing.

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:43.930
Okay, okay, I'll tell her after lunch.
Oof, you know what else?

01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:45.690
I can see down your tank top.

01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:53.521
- Hey there.
- Hey.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:56.803
- Wanted to introduce ourselves. I'm Dan.
- Hey, Dan.

01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:58.883
My wife, Kathy. We just moved in.

01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:00.685
- Hello.
- We're the Johnsons.

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:03.002
Oh, great. Welcome to the neighborhood.

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:04.965
Hey, guys. Come here.

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:06.286
Come meet our neighbors.

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:07.527
I'm David.

01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:09.888
And this is my family right here.

01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:11.280
This is my son, Kenny.

01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:12.646
My daughter, Casey.

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.326
- And this is my wife, Sarah.
- Nice to meet you.

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:18.046
- We're the Millers.
- Ah. Pleasure.

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:20.567
Thanks for saying hi.
All right, take care now.

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:22.609
- See you soon. Bye.
- Bye.

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:25.161
- I don't like them.
- I don't like them either.

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.721
Why introduce yourself?
I mean, who the fuck are you?

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:30.884
I can't believe this.
We're stuck in the suburbs.

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:35.045
Now, this sucks. I can't wait for the
trial to be over. Gotta get outta here.

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:41.447
Stick to the big A.

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.170
- Anal.
- Abstinence, you meant.

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.129
- Neither makes a baby.
- He confuses...

01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:47.965
Oscars! For all of you!

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:51.124
That's very nice of you, but we're
not that good of an actor, no.

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.887
- Those guys are picking on that girl.
- Where?

01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:01.568
- I'll never forget these moments.
- What?

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.200
- And I hope you don't either.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:05.880
And, action.

01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:09.963
It takes two men to open this
mini-fridge.

01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:12.568
Aah!

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:16.611
It's literally so hard!

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:20.160
- Okay, you guys, seriously, you're mak...
- Ha-ha-ha!

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:21.487
Look, look, look.

01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:24.769
- Ha, ha!
- Leave the girls alone.

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:28.089
What are you gonna do, freckles?
What are you gonna do, Don Knotts?

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:30.322
What are you gonna do,
guy with great posture?

01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:34.802
Ow! Broke my nose!

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:37.401
I'm terrified of blood,
you know what I'm saying?

01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:40.684
You just deviated my septum,
you know what I'm saying?

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:44.287
Uh, I want a Band-Aid.

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:47.762
- Closed?
- They're closed. Till morning.

01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:50.400
Oklahoma.
Oh, poop.

01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.642
Cheese and rice.
Ants on a log.

01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:55.121
Poop on a Popsicle.
Oh, cock marbles.

01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:58.170
- Oh, fuck.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.451
It just stopped at a certain point...

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:18.041
...and you just couldn't
insert it any more.

01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:21.363
Well, I just looked like I had,
like, a Stormtrooper dick.

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:27.849
So I'm just gonna... There we go.
There they are.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.081
This is crazy.

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:32.363
Those are just gorgeous, gorgeous,
gorgeous breasts.

01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:36.564
Cut! All right. Cut.

01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:38.929
- And, action.
- Whoo!

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:42.010
- How about a little victory music, shall we?
- Yes, please.

01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:46.810
- I love this song!
- This is awesome!

01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:55.127
<i>You're job's a joke, you're broke
Your love life's D.O.A.</i>

01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:58.284
<i>I'll be there for you</i>

01:53:58.440 --> 01:53:59.965
<i>When the rain starts to fall</i>

01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:03.283
<i>I'll be there for you</i>

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:06.006
<i>'Cause you're there for me too</i>

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:08.527
That was really good.

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:12.681
That's very funny.

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:25.208
<i>Adiós, Millers.</i>
