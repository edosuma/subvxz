01:40.768 --> 01:43.728
- Let's take it to the lighthouse.
- Absolutely.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.688
- Show the way!
- Come on.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.743
- It's the liquidators.
- Really?

01:58.911 --> 02:00.453
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:16.804 --> 02:21.516
Say, fat chops, you got the time? Or did you eat your pocket watch?

02:21.600 --> 02:23.976
- Bug off, you little shit.
- Fuck you.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.146
Son of a bitch!

02:29.525 --> 02:31.609
Come here, you little guinea bastard.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.319
Come back here.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.906
I'm gonna kick the shit... Get over here.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.435
Was that nice, Daddy?

03:06.979 --> 03:07.979
Mmm.

03:09.565 --> 03:11.524
Who makes you feel good?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.276
You do, kid.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.654
Me and nobody else?

03:20.200 --> 03:23.119
'Cause I see how the other girls look at you.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.162
Mmm.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.124
But I'm your little tiger cub.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.462
Hmm?

03:38.594 --> 03:43.014
You just make me want to run around the jungle.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.433
And...

03:48.228 --> 03:49.437
Pounce!

03:50.856 --> 03:52.523
Jesus!

03:52.649 --> 03:54.734
What the hell's wrong with you?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.111
I'm your little tiger.

03:57.321 --> 03:59.655
Then I should use a goddamn whip.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.242
Don't be mad, Daddy.

04:03.994 --> 04:07.788
I can't help it. You just make me wild.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.916
I'm fucking bleeding.

04:10.334 --> 04:13.336
- Can I put some gauze on it?
- Forget it.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.714
Just don't get so carried away. Huh?

04:44.785 --> 04:45.785
Mrs. Schroeder.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.540
I was wondering if we might speak about a private matter.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.096
Yes, of course.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.141
A man has made me an offer.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.810
Of what nature?

05:11.561 --> 05:14.730
Financial? Domestic? Sexual?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.400
Yes.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.236
Who is he?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.864
He runs things.

05:26.910 --> 05:30.204
He'll provide for me and my children.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.081
Will he marry you?

05:33.417 --> 05:35.209
I wouldn't think so.

05:37.421 --> 05:40.381
There are various words for that sort of woman,

05:40.465 --> 05:42.591
none of them are flattering.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.928
He'll provide, ma'am.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.893
Do you know why I live in Atlantic City?

05:53.270 --> 05:56.856
- No.
- Mr. McGarry owned a quarter interest

05:56.940 --> 05:59.608
in an oilfield in Titusville, Pennsylvania.

06:00.736 --> 06:05.531
A man from the Standard Oil Company made him a large cash offer for his share.

06:06.867 --> 06:11.871
And so Mr. McGarry built a 16-room mansion on the shore.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.625
Six months later he was dead of influenza.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.963
I now live in a smaller house on Raleigh Avenue.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.673
It suits my needs

06:22.799 --> 06:26.886
and I have the freedom to devote myself to matters I consider important.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.055
The Movement.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.224
Temperance was meant to protect women, Margaret,

06:32.976 --> 06:36.145
but the ballot box will free us.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.733
Only one more state for complete ratification.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.652
I've no mansion to sell, ma'am.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.865
Which is why you must do as you see fit.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.827
You owe no one else an explanation.

06:57.959 --> 07:02.755
This contains useful knowledge.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.382
I highly recommend that you read it.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.457
Give me one of those.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.725
How about you call in sick tonight?

07:57.727 --> 07:59.687
Don't you ever get tired?

08:00.564 --> 08:02.398
Not with you, I don't.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.568
Like you do with the other girls.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.656
- Not tired exactly.
- No?

08:11.908 --> 08:12.950
What is it then?

08:14.327 --> 08:15.786
It's nothin'.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.584
It don't work.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.378
That horse cock? Please.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.172
I'm serious.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.966
You're the first broad in years who put any lead in my pencil at all.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.844
- You don't have to flatter me, dear.
- I ain't. Honest injun.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.513
Couple years ago I had an affliction down there.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.724
It got better, but then...

08:38.101 --> 08:39.351
I don't know.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.187
It just didn't work no more.

08:42.898 --> 08:43.898
Then you met me.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.152
And then I met you.

09:03.960 --> 09:04.960
Yeah?

09:06.630 --> 09:08.797
What kind of way is that to answer a telephone?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.133
- A.R.
- So?

09:12.219 --> 09:14.845
I gather you haven't made it up to Saratoga.

09:14.930 --> 09:15.971
Yeah, no, not yet.

09:16.806 --> 09:20.684
- How'd you know where I was?
- I have a crystal ball, Charlie. You know that.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.770
I see

09:23.480 --> 09:25.606
you're not wearing your trousers.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.278
So what gives?

09:31.821 --> 09:34.615
I've been waiting for a report on Mr. Darmody.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.783
Right.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.994
Yeah, well I can't really speak to that now.

09:39.496 --> 09:43.457
I wouldn't think so, considering the company you've been keeping.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.877
Can I call you back? I'm with his wife right now.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.838
No, you're not, Charlie.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.341
You're with his mother.

10:00.642 --> 10:04.645
A kid and a skinny fella in broad daylight on the boards.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.690
I'm still thunderstruck. In this day and age.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.984
They're not from your ward, you're sure about that?

10:10.068 --> 10:13.070
No, I know every tick on the hind of every dog.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.532
Maybe over to Boyd's turf. They had a dago look.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.534
And what look is that?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.370
Feebleminded.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.789
I'll get the boys cracking, Nuck.

10:23.873 --> 10:27.626
If there's a nickel of your money in a nun's cooze, we'll shake it loose.

10:27.711 --> 10:30.045
Why don't we let Eli handle it?

10:30.255 --> 10:31.338
And put a steak on that.

10:43.393 --> 10:47.271
On the Boardwalk, Eli, 100 yards from my suite.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.483
And laying in wait, too, obviously. That was his last stop.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.320
Nobody from A.C. Would be dumb enough to pull a stunt like this.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.405
These fuckin' Italians though,

10:56.781 --> 10:58.407
they don't respect the rules.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.831
Luciano, is he still hanging around?

11:06.333 --> 11:09.084
- Who?
- Rothstein's torpedo, the greaseball.

11:09.252 --> 11:12.463
I'll give you three to one he's either behind this or knows who is.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.089
So is he?

11:14.591 --> 11:15.591
Is he what?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.509
- Hanging around!
- He comes and goes.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.678
I got other fish to fry besides him.

11:19.763 --> 11:20.763
Well, fry them already!

11:20.847 --> 11:23.057
I don't want this happening ever again

11:23.141 --> 11:26.352
where some guinea pissant gets the idea that he...

11:28.104 --> 11:29.355
Knock, God damn it.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.522
I did.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.690
Well, knock like a man.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.400
I think I should not disturb you.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.611
- Then why are you?
- Frank Hague,

11:35.695 --> 11:38.280
- the mayor of Jersey City...
- I know who the fuck he is.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.531
He wishes to tell you

11:39.616 --> 11:43.118
he has spent several nights waiting at the Hotel Shelburne.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.538
He does not wish to spend many more.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.624
Unless you see him soon...

11:53.880 --> 11:55.881
"There are many roads to Rome,

11:55.965 --> 11:59.551
"but there will be only one through New Jersey."

12:01.471 --> 12:02.805
Set up a dinner or something.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.727
And you bring that dago in.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.995
Careful. What if you miss?

12:27.288 --> 12:28.831
The trick is not to, so I don't.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.252
Are you fucking crazy?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.507
Over there you never played five-finger fillet?

12:40.051 --> 12:42.678
We did. I'm just sayin',

12:43.513 --> 12:46.348
we were more interested in winning the war.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.018
Go ahead.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.563
For old times.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.943
Johnny's coming.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.460
Hey, Johnny, how you doing?

13:15.003 --> 13:17.004
I got a cracked molar is how I'm doing.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.716
- Did you see a dentist?
- For what?

13:22.010 --> 13:23.635
Might as well yank it out yourself, right?

13:26.723 --> 13:29.391
We're sitting down with Sheridan, getting outta Greektown.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.355
- How come?
- I gave you the chance.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.150
I don't need the money, I don't need the aggravation.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.111
It was a... Whattaya? An oversight, that's all.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.197
You wanna put me in a war?

13:43.281 --> 13:45.824
That's why I brung you out from fucking Brooklyn?

13:45.909 --> 13:49.244
You watch the door. You drive my car.

13:50.705 --> 13:51.788
And you.

13:52.457 --> 13:53.957
Are you smart?

13:54.792 --> 13:56.043
Are you?

13:58.630 --> 14:00.380
Go clean the Buick.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.016
Fucking micks. No offense.

14:11.601 --> 14:16.480
They crawl up outta the bog, come in here, my house, and spill blood

14:16.773 --> 14:18.941
'cause that one don't know how to do business.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.651
I think it's a mistake, Johnny.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.403
What's with this Johnny shit?

14:23.488 --> 14:24.863
Mr. Torrio.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.282
To get out of Greektown completely.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.661
We made headway at that bar, Anastos'.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.207
- What kinda money did that joint bring in?
- Good.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.125
Not great, but it's a foothold.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.171
I know you don't want a war,

14:42.131 --> 14:43.632
but retreating?

14:44.884 --> 14:45.926
How does that look?

14:52.475 --> 14:55.310
We should talk to them, Mr. Torrio.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.188
We should come to an understanding.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.692
What's that supposed to mean?

15:07.323 --> 15:10.075
I wish I'd known you were coming, sir. I would have prepared something.

15:10.159 --> 15:15.163
It's a surprise field office review, Nelson. Lack of notice is precisely the point.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.082
Of course.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.002
I told you this isn't a damn storage room.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.169
Clear out!

15:26.801 --> 15:30.470
The report I mentioned in my wire, sir. I had planned to mail it.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.681
Well, you certainly have plenty of stamps.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.353
You're placing Enoch Thompson at the head of a criminal organization

15:38.438 --> 15:40.272
controlling Atlantic County.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.941
I believe I've established a pervasive pattern of illegality

15:43.026 --> 15:45.527
as it relates to alcohol with him at the very center.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.363
Where are the financial records?

15:48.531 --> 15:52.200
The corroborating witnesses? What do I take to the District Attorney?

15:52.368 --> 15:54.453
I'm asking for the resources to build that case.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.246
I need numbers, Nelson!

15:56.331 --> 15:58.582
Bottles broken by the thousand,

15:58.666 --> 16:00.959
trucks, boats and stills seized and put out of commission.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.753
There's also a capital crime there.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.297
I don't see it.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.508
Thompson sent James Darmody to steal back a shipment of whiskey

16:08.593 --> 16:10.302
he sold to Arnold Rothstein.

16:10.720 --> 16:14.389
Darmody and an unnamed accomplice executed five men.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.225
Then Thompson pinned the murders on Hans Schroeder.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.020
What is this obsession with the Schroeder character?

16:21.022 --> 16:22.147
Sir?

16:22.231 --> 16:25.067
You requisitioned the immigration file on his wife?

16:30.406 --> 16:32.407
I'm only being thorough, sir.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.661
You're a Prohibition agent, not Bulldog Drummond.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.415
Bring me numbers.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.679
What time is it?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.515
About half three.

16:58.434 --> 17:02.020
3:30.

17:03.481 --> 17:06.983
It's 3:30, bearcat. Get a wiggle on.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.819
Don't go overboard.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.445
You don't want me to sound American.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.491
No, I don't think I do.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.619
An Irish maiden, that's what you'd like.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.873
And what would you like?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.376
I haven't thought about it.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.586
That's a lot of bunk.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.675
What'll my neighbors say?

17:32.343 --> 17:35.220
They're not gonna be your neighbors anymore.

17:36.431 --> 17:39.015
Do you give all the widows new flats?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.601
I help out where I can.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.525
And what happened here?

17:50.695 --> 17:52.070
A hunting accident.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.615
Who was hunting whom?

17:58.828 --> 18:01.079
I have to pick up the children

18:01.164 --> 18:03.874
- and get back to work.
- No, you don't.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.585
And then what am I?

18:48.377 --> 18:50.712
Are you sure I can't slice something, peel something?

18:50.797 --> 18:53.048
You're a guest. You get up and I'll break your legs.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.175
What's he saying?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.259
Nothing. He wants to help.

18:56.344 --> 18:59.596
Al told me about your friend. Poor girl down at the restaurant?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.681
Pearl. The waitress.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.518
Right. Yeah.

19:04.602 --> 19:08.230
Such a tragedy. My God! To get hit by a streetcar.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.858
You want to talk to that driver, make sure he's more careful in the future.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.151
Yeah.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.530
How many links, Princeton?

19:16.697 --> 19:18.532
Uh... Just one will do.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.075
I'll give you three.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.619
He's a grown man, Al. He knows what he wants.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.205
And he'll take what I give him.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.124
Sonny?

19:28.251 --> 19:30.085
Leave him. He's in his own world.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.422
Sonny, dinner.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.759
Fucking kid.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.596
Come on, baby. Time to eat.

19:42.765 --> 19:43.765
Make some coffee.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.185
Did that stupid Irish cow break her arms?

19:47.603 --> 19:50.272
You know, I may not talk Italian, but I know what stupido means.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.113
Some house I got.

19:58.447 --> 20:02.450
A guinea for a mother, a mick for a wife and a dumbbell for a son.

20:02.827 --> 20:03.869
Don't call him that.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.787
I got a little boy myself at home.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.039
Yeah? Do you have a likeness?

20:08.124 --> 20:11.459
Not with me. He's a little guy, dark eyes like his mom.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.420
A real chatterbox.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.547
But he comes when you call him at least, huh?

20:15.631 --> 20:18.383
Mostly. He's got a mind of his own though.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.846
You like your eggs, Sonny?

20:25.683 --> 20:27.642
I told you. He's a dopey little bastard.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.108
Mama.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.032
I got it. I got it, okay?

21:14.357 --> 21:16.775
How about this?

21:20.321 --> 21:21.613
No.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.074
Perhaps Madame could describe it better to me.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.368
Why does anybody buy underwear?

21:26.786 --> 21:30.246
Some women wish to hide, others wish to reveal.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.875
Well, I want it in lights.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.003
Something vampy

21:38.089 --> 21:39.381
and sheer,

21:40.841 --> 21:42.842
with a cutout right here.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.888
A moment please.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.267
You got some job, sister.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.311
I've done worse.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.271
I bet you have.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.109
And voilà.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.831
I want to see what it looks like.

22:13.749 --> 22:14.916
On her.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.491
You don't wear a brassiere?

23:32.745 --> 23:35.330
I've tried them. They're not comfortable.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.832
You should try again. You're saggy.

23:39.710 --> 23:42.128
You've had children. You can tell.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.008
You look like the kitchen help.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.887
A quickie bent over the table.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.474
He doesn't seem to mind.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.854
You don't know very much, do you?

24:00.189 --> 24:01.898
You'd be surprised.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.693
They raised him a good Catholic boy.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.906
And every once in a while

24:10.825 --> 24:13.618
he starts thinking he might go to hell,

24:13.953 --> 24:17.288
and that he'd better change before it's too late.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.708
But all I gotta do is this.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.088
And this.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.390
And then he doesn't feel so Catholic anymore.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.354
When I was a girl in Ireland,

24:41.564 --> 24:43.523
a raggedy man would come round every spring

24:43.607 --> 24:45.817
with a little bantam rooster.

24:46.068 --> 24:48.736
He'd trained it to peck out The Mountains of Mourne

24:48.904 --> 24:51.573
on a toy piano that hung off his chest.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.241
So?

24:53.576 --> 24:56.327
Well, the first year he came,

24:56.579 --> 25:00.623
we, all of us, the girls in that place, we thought it magical.

25:01.584 --> 25:04.669
The second year, we laughed behind our hands

25:04.753 --> 25:06.963
at the odd man in his tatters.

25:07.464 --> 25:10.091
And the third year, we didn't even go.

25:10.217 --> 25:13.845
Because The Mountains of Mourne was all that little rooster could ever do.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.431
So what's the point?

25:18.058 --> 25:21.769
That maybe your cunny isn't quite the draw you think it is.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.196
I quit.

25:56.472 --> 25:57.805
Thank you.

25:58.807 --> 25:59.974
Let me help you, Mr. Kessler.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.517
No, no, please.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.814
Come, children, come.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.956
Emily, Teddy, be careful. Don't break anything.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.333
They break, it will be fixed.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.004
The kitchen has food to start.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.426
The dining, a bathroom.

26:35.636 --> 26:40.014
Upstairs there is a room for the boy, a room for the girl

26:40.099 --> 26:42.016
and the master bedroom.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.310
It's very beautiful.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.355
Yes, good. Missus, I go now.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.316
Do I wait for Mr. Thompson?

26:50.693 --> 26:52.610
Oh, he will call.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.571
Is he nice to you, Mr. Kessler?

26:56.198 --> 26:58.449
Nucky? Yes, he is nice.

26:58.993 --> 27:01.911
Mr. Thompson is a very nice man.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.415
Are you trying to sass me, you greasy cocksucker?

27:06.625 --> 27:08.084
I thought you was all about manners.

27:08.168 --> 27:11.296
I treat people as gentlemen until they prove otherwise.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.298
All you've proven is you're a thieving little prick

27:13.382 --> 27:14.674
who shows up where he doesn't belong.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.801
Since when do you need permission to look at the ocean?

27:16.885 --> 27:18.553
To look at my ocean?

27:19.763 --> 27:22.473
Since your boss tried to lift 100 grand out of my pocket.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.475
Mr. Rothstein don't see it that way.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.769
Mr. Rothstein don't run this town.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.855
No, he runs New York. Maybe you heard of it.

27:28.939 --> 27:30.440
You like it around here though, do you?

27:32.026 --> 27:34.360
I like the view between that geisha's legs.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.909
You're referring to Gillian Darmody?

27:42.953 --> 27:44.579
Is that her name?

27:49.293 --> 27:52.211
I'll fucking bury this in your fucking head.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.425
Get the fuck off me!

28:08.771 --> 28:13.983
Mrs. Darmody is free to do as she pleases, not always to her benefit.

28:14.777 --> 28:20.281
But I strongly suggest you treat her in every particular with the utmost regard.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.207
Charles, right?

28:29.291 --> 28:32.418
Lucky.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.797
Everything you see here, it's mine.

28:35.881 --> 28:39.550
Buy a drink, place a bet, ride the fucking Ferris wheel.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.094
- And if you steal...
- I ain't took nothing.

28:41.178 --> 28:45.431
If you steal, Charles, from my men,

28:46.558 --> 28:48.226
you steal from me.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.604
So tell the pack of guineas you came down here with

28:51.730 --> 28:54.357
and tell your boss in New York.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.150
I don't know what you're talking about.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.570
Jesus Christ!

29:00.322 --> 29:02.240
What the fuck are you doing?

29:02.324 --> 29:04.242
You said to knock in a manly fashion.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.077
Well, leave the door on the hinges.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.412
What do you want?

29:07.496 --> 29:08.496
Mrs. Schroeder.

29:09.665 --> 29:10.665
Yes?

29:11.208 --> 29:13.709
Is very happy with the accommodations.

29:15.462 --> 29:16.546
Good.

29:17.965 --> 29:19.340
You can go.

29:19.967 --> 29:24.178
Thank you very much, Mr. Thompson, for showing me how it's done here.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.787
It's open.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.296
Hey, Kit.

29:59.173 --> 30:02.717
You don't really want to be in here all by yourself, do you?

30:07.431 --> 30:08.848
I think I do.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.189
She left this

30:16.273 --> 30:17.398
in my room.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.235
Thanks.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.571
Hey. Come down and sit with us.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.406
I will.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.909
A few minutes.

32:04.506 --> 32:05.631
She's not there.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.343
You're looking for that one? She's gone.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.179
You are?

32:12.931 --> 32:14.015
Edith Mauer.

32:14.516 --> 32:15.600
Mrs.

32:15.684 --> 32:16.684
Mrs. Mauer,

32:17.477 --> 32:18.686
where is she?

32:18.770 --> 32:20.980
Off drinking champagne, I wouldn't be surprised.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.857
Why do you say that?

32:23.984 --> 32:25.443
She's out all hours.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.361
Expects me to watch over her brats.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.405
And she works for French people.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.198
The Ritz.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.659
Nothing but the best for her.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.661
Pretty high opinion of herself?

32:36.288 --> 32:38.039
Butter wouldn't melt.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.541
And not four months a widow.

32:41.668 --> 32:42.877
He was a lovely man.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.128
Mr. Schroeder?

32:44.212 --> 32:46.464
- He always brought us the day-old crullers.
- Mmm.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.966
- And just now...
- Yeah?

32:49.051 --> 32:52.345
...a blue limousine pulls up and carts them off, her and her children.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.347
- A Rolls?
- How's that?

32:54.431 --> 32:56.098
The limousine. A Rolls-Royce?

32:57.601 --> 32:58.726
It certainly was.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.732
She did something wrong, didn't she?

33:07.569 --> 33:10.154
Is there anything else you can tell me?

33:10.238 --> 33:11.238
Yes.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.116
She's a whore.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.252
Mae Murray, that's who you look like.

33:25.712 --> 33:28.089
- You really think so?
- Sure I do.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.591
The Taming of Kaiser Bull.

33:30.676 --> 33:33.135
Maybe I'll take you to the pictures.

33:48.652 --> 33:49.777
Classy. Huh?

33:50.153 --> 33:53.739
I was a kid, there was a sign outside, "No dogs or Irish."

33:53.824 --> 33:55.449
Now I can buy this fucking joint.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.952
You're an inspiration to us all.

33:58.495 --> 33:59.662
Go on, search them.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.374
After the stunt you pulled, you don't trust me?

34:03.458 --> 34:04.667
No, I don't.

34:06.420 --> 34:07.920
They're clean.

34:21.143 --> 34:24.018
Tip her good. She's a real beauty, this one.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.438
Thanks.

34:26.523 --> 34:28.065
Any time.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.609
So?

34:31.194 --> 34:32.235
So what?

34:32.320 --> 34:34.739
- Now we search you fellas.
- It was you called this meet,

34:34.822 --> 34:35.906
not me.

34:35.991 --> 34:38.074
And I'll tell youse right now. I am packing heat.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.786
- We all are.
- No, that wasn't the deal.

34:40.871 --> 34:42.788
You want to hash this out or not?

34:42.873 --> 34:44.581
I don't like this, Johnny.

34:44.666 --> 34:45.666
If I wanted to kill youse,

34:45.751 --> 34:48.002
you wouldn't have made it through the front door.

34:51.797 --> 34:52.840
All right.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.886
Relax. Everything's gonna be fine.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.569
Sorry for the ruckus, but ask anybody who knows me,

35:13.653 --> 35:16.030
Charlie Sheridan ain't a fella takes a threat lying down.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.657
We were expanding our reach. It wasn't so much a threat.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.951
Dipping our toes in the water.

35:21.036 --> 35:24.079
And youse got all wet. At least your whore did.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.040
She was 18-years-old.

35:26.541 --> 35:27.625
What?

35:29.211 --> 35:30.294
The girl.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.254
So youse want to get sentimental?

35:32.339 --> 35:34.799
Anastos, the Greek fella youse beat on?

35:34.883 --> 35:36.217
You cracked his jaw.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.052
He can't eat regular for another month.

35:38.178 --> 35:39.845
Let's just say the whole thing

35:39.930 --> 35:43.307
was an unfortunate series of misunderstandings.

35:46.311 --> 35:47.394
Fine.

35:50.273 --> 35:51.816
I'm sorry about the girl.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.571
Your mug, Liam,

35:58.782 --> 36:00.449
it'd be nice to hear that from him.

36:00.534 --> 36:01.826
Liam works for me.

36:02.327 --> 36:06.163
I told him to pick a whore and he did, in order so's I could make my point.

36:06.248 --> 36:09.291
And you did, and it's done. Over.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.420
Let's talk turkey.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.756
Fine.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.469
In the interest of keeping good relations,

36:21.805 --> 36:23.347
I'll give youse a three-block territory

36:23.431 --> 36:26.684
starting on Hallstead, between Randolph and Monroe.

36:26.768 --> 36:29.770
There's some good joints there, real busy. You should make a decent buck.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.314
The rest of the delta,

36:32.399 --> 36:34.108
meaning anything between Harrison...

36:36.319 --> 36:38.153
Ho! What the fuck?

36:38.363 --> 36:39.572
Nobody fucking move.

36:39.656 --> 36:41.031
- Easy.
- His boot!

36:41.783 --> 36:43.284
The fuck's he got in there?

36:44.286 --> 36:45.494
It's a knife.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.123
I thought you fucking searched them.

36:59.301 --> 37:01.302
You sneak a blade into a meet.

37:01.595 --> 37:03.095
What the fuck you trying to pull?

37:03.179 --> 37:04.930
You fellas got guns.

37:05.015 --> 37:08.100
I forgot I had it on me. I'm sorry.

37:12.314 --> 37:13.939
Maybe I cut your throat with it.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.817
Next time you'll remember.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.246
What's this?

37:31.625 --> 37:33.584
It's called a skull crusher.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.463
It's for cracking walnuts.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.884
I'll crack a few with it, let you know.

37:42.844 --> 37:44.011
Let's have a drink.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.348
Let bygones be bygones, all around.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.663
- I'm gonna visit the head.
- I'll bring the car around.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.584
- Thanks, sweetie. Here's for you.
- Thanks.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.211
What happened to the blonde?

38:17.921 --> 38:19.254
She's on coffee break.

38:32.769 --> 38:33.894
Thank you.

38:41.403 --> 38:42.444
Christ!

38:46.449 --> 38:47.700
Come on, wrap it up.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.910
- Come on.
- You prick.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.370
Fuck.

38:51.913 --> 38:53.080
Go, get out of here, go!

39:01.006 --> 39:02.923
You piece of shit. Come here.

39:04.300 --> 39:07.094
I think you'd agree that Greektown belongs to us now.

39:16.604 --> 39:17.604
Come on.

39:53.183 --> 39:54.683
What are you up to in there?

39:55.393 --> 39:56.643
Are you ill?

39:57.437 --> 39:59.354
I was luxuriating.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.775
I like making you happy.

40:03.860 --> 40:09.531
Thank you.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.202
And

40:14.329 --> 40:15.621
thank you.

40:23.213 --> 40:25.631
That'll take some getting used to.

40:32.639 --> 40:33.722
Hello.

40:34.224 --> 40:35.265
Yeah.

40:36.476 --> 40:37.643
God damn it.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.355
Tell him I'm on my way.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.567
- Is something wrong?
- Just business.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.281
You know who Hardeen is?

40:51.407 --> 40:54.284
- Should I?
- He's Houdini's brother.

40:54.494 --> 40:55.828
But he's just as good.

40:56.663 --> 40:58.455
He's opening tonight at the Globe.

40:58.540 --> 40:59.706
I have to turn up.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.043
- Business again, is it?
- Partly.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.379
I'd like you to come with me.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.630
See the act.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.299
We'll have a light supper with him after, just us.

41:09.384 --> 41:11.218
With Mr. Hardeen?

41:12.011 --> 41:13.262
His wife maybe, too.

41:13.346 --> 41:14.513
At the Marlborough.

41:15.181 --> 41:16.306
These show people,

41:16.724 --> 41:18.892
some of them are a lot of fun.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.396
Houdini's brother.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.898
Does he escape from things as well?

41:25.650 --> 41:28.402
I'll bet he escapes from the dinner check.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.002
Sorry, fellas. Private party.

41:45.712 --> 41:48.213
Pick a gal though. Enjoy yourselves.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.760
He's a genius, this kid.

41:54.095 --> 41:55.429
Fucking strategy.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.181
They'd come after us eventually.

41:57.265 --> 41:59.725
"Us"? So you're sticking around?

42:01.978 --> 42:03.979
I could use a dozen like you.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.772
The balls on this mick.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.692
Fucking Ruggiero.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.360
Who's that?

42:10.445 --> 42:13.197
The puppet with the sword. In Sicily.

42:19.662 --> 42:23.165
I'd just like to say that Jimmy Darmody's a stand-up guy.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.293
When he ain't on the floor pissin' himself, that is.

42:29.297 --> 42:31.798
A few weeks ago, I'm up in his room,

42:31.883 --> 42:33.550
I squeeze a shot off as a joke.

42:33.635 --> 42:36.470
Next thing he's practically humping the floor.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.513
Swear to God.

42:41.226 --> 42:44.269
But you know, he was over there in France,

42:44.354 --> 42:48.899
and I heard there wasn't one paddy that could scrub a latrine whiter than our Jim.

42:53.738 --> 42:54.738
Here's to him.

42:58.368 --> 43:01.495
Not like you, huh, Captain Capone?

43:03.206 --> 43:05.499
Hand-to-hand with the Kaiser himself.

43:08.753 --> 43:11.880
That is how you got your scars, right, Al?

43:13.549 --> 43:16.385
Unlike some of us, I don't need to brag about what I did.

43:17.262 --> 43:18.887
The Lost Battalion.

43:19.389 --> 43:22.015
He got so lost he thought Brooklyn was in France.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.948
All week you got me cooling my heels.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.285
In a deluxe suite at the Shelburne. You don't like it?

43:42.203 --> 43:43.996
I'm a simple man.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.331
All I need is a bed, the love of a good woman,

43:46.416 --> 43:48.125
and an envelope about so thick.

43:48.751 --> 43:50.377
I made sure you got all three.

43:51.004 --> 43:52.879
That you did, my host.

43:55.591 --> 43:57.551
So are you gonna fight me on this road appropriations bill?

43:57.885 --> 43:59.428
I got mouths to feed up north, too.

43:59.721 --> 44:02.848
There's plenty for both of us, so let's be fair with each other.

44:03.224 --> 44:05.225
You don't have enough friends in Trenton these days?

44:06.060 --> 44:08.228
I got a man I'm sending to the White House.

44:08.354 --> 44:09.396
That's a friend worth having.

44:11.107 --> 44:12.399
"Ladies and gentlemen,

44:12.483 --> 44:15.402
"the green thumb of the Garden State, Senator Walter Edge."

44:16.362 --> 44:18.196
So he's not the great emancipator.

44:18.448 --> 44:20.282
But it'll pay off for me.

44:20.366 --> 44:22.326
And if the two of us shake hands on the road money,

44:22.410 --> 44:24.286
it'll pay off for you.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.588
Where are we going after this?

44:35.256 --> 44:36.298
Tonight?

44:37.216 --> 44:40.427
You got something more important? 'Cause I can head home.

44:42.138 --> 44:44.264
- You wanna see Hardeen?
- Who?

44:45.016 --> 44:48.060
Houdini's brother, but he's just as good. I was gonna take my girl.

44:48.603 --> 44:50.187
What, I'm the third wheel?

44:50.938 --> 44:52.731
I'll get you a date.

44:53.232 --> 44:54.358
Only one?

45:03.076 --> 45:04.117
Who is it?

45:18.007 --> 45:19.466
Who's there?

45:49.747 --> 45:51.706
Supposing I was the Fuller Brush salesman?

45:51.791 --> 45:53.291
- What's behind your back?
- My hands.

45:53.376 --> 45:55.043
Don't get cute! What are you holding?

45:56.879 --> 45:59.506
What are you worried about, tough guy?

46:09.559 --> 46:10.684
Steaks.

46:11.185 --> 46:13.478
Chicago's finest. They packed them in salt.

46:15.231 --> 46:17.607
When we met first time, you said you liked 'em.

46:22.947 --> 46:24.698
Do you wanna come in?

46:39.172 --> 46:40.547
Drink?

46:41.340 --> 46:44.593
I get stupid I drink too much, run off at the mouth.

46:50.975 --> 46:53.268
That stuff you said in front of the boys,

46:53.352 --> 46:54.686
about me and the war?

46:55.646 --> 46:56.730
It makes me look bad.

46:57.523 --> 46:59.774
That ain't how you treat a buddy.

47:00.860 --> 47:02.152
Is that what we are?

47:03.112 --> 47:04.446
What did you think we were?

47:05.823 --> 47:06.990
Accomplices.

47:08.618 --> 47:10.660
It's the same thing, right?

47:13.581 --> 47:14.664
Those steaks,

47:14.749 --> 47:16.791
have one of the girls fry them up with eggs.

47:16.876 --> 47:18.001
Not too long.

47:18.085 --> 47:22.923
Or, you know, come around the house, whenever, we'll make them there.

47:24.342 --> 47:25.675
Yeah, sure.

47:28.346 --> 47:29.429
Thanks.

47:31.057 --> 47:32.265
Okay then.

47:37.438 --> 47:38.772
He's deaf, you know.

47:41.859 --> 47:43.318
My boy, Sonny.

47:47.365 --> 47:48.406
I know.

47:48.783 --> 47:52.994
It fucking kills me to think he's being punished for the shit I done.

47:53.704 --> 47:55.121
Take him to a doctor, Al.

47:55.206 --> 47:58.291
They can't fix it. It's... It's in the blood.

48:01.963 --> 48:03.630
I play the mandolin.

48:05.216 --> 48:06.633
Sing to him.

48:08.678 --> 48:11.304
Put his hand right here.

48:15.518 --> 48:17.060
He feels it.

48:19.230 --> 48:21.523
But he doesn't know what it is.

48:26.237 --> 48:27.362
Just

48:28.489 --> 48:29.656
keep at it.

48:30.992 --> 48:34.911
Medicine now, they're finding new things every day.

48:39.709 --> 48:41.084
Hey, what's

48:41.961 --> 48:44.337
a flat beer and that Sheridan prick got in common?

48:46.549 --> 48:47.757
No head.

48:52.513 --> 48:54.180
I came up with that myself.

49:25.463 --> 49:26.921
A lot of noise from a little box.

49:27.506 --> 49:30.091
Which one are we talking about?

49:30.176 --> 49:32.218
You're a devil at heart, Mr. Hague.

49:36.140 --> 49:38.975
So what's your pleasure, you Republican son of a bitch?

49:40.603 --> 49:42.145
I want the highway.

49:42.229 --> 49:44.147
Two lanes coming south from Newark,

49:44.231 --> 49:46.066
and a straight shot to the Pennsylvania border.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.233
New York and Philly?

49:47.318 --> 49:48.610
Can we shake on it?

49:57.161 --> 49:59.579
You're putting a big bet on Walter Edge.

49:59.747 --> 50:01.748
- Maybe.
- I wouldn't.

50:02.792 --> 50:04.000
Why not?

50:04.085 --> 50:07.253
Because he's a silent partner in a paving company.

50:09.048 --> 50:10.423
Where?

50:10.508 --> 50:11.841
It doesn't really have an address,

50:11.926 --> 50:15.762
but let's say it's Jersey City, where your roads aren't.

50:18.933 --> 50:20.433
Why are you telling me this, Frank?

50:21.268 --> 50:23.895
'Cause guys like Edge will come and go.

50:24.438 --> 50:26.856
But bosses like us?

50:28.984 --> 50:30.276
We're here to stay.

50:42.164 --> 50:44.582
"'Pussycat, pussycat, what did you there? '

50:44.667 --> 50:47.752
"'I frightened a little mouse under the chair."'

50:50.464 --> 50:51.923
They're usually asleep by 9:00,

50:52.007 --> 50:54.092
so they shouldn't be any trouble.

50:54.343 --> 50:56.845
No trouble at all. I love babies.

50:57.471 --> 51:00.473
I sit for most of the other young ladies, too.

51:03.644 --> 51:05.103
I don't usually...

51:06.439 --> 51:08.565
I'm seeing Hardeen tonight.

51:08.983 --> 51:10.650
Yes, very nice.

51:16.741 --> 51:18.158
Excuse me.

51:23.038 --> 51:24.622
- Hello?
- Missus.

51:24.999 --> 51:26.332
Mr. Kessler.

51:27.168 --> 51:28.877
Did I not have the time right?

51:29.086 --> 51:31.045
- The time?
- Of the show.

51:31.589 --> 51:34.048
Mr. Thompson said you'd pick me up.

51:34.175 --> 51:37.844
Missus, Nucky wishes to say he is busy tonight.

51:38.012 --> 51:39.345
I'm sorry?

51:39.930 --> 51:42.766
Tonight he has business. He said to tell you.

51:42.850 --> 51:43.850
Oh.

51:45.060 --> 51:46.394
Very well.

51:46.520 --> 51:47.979
He will call.

51:55.738 --> 51:56.780
Ma'am?

52:00.826 --> 52:02.869
I'm Annabelle, your neighbor across the way?

52:03.579 --> 52:04.788
Margaret Schroeder.

52:05.748 --> 52:06.790
Are they yours?

52:07.291 --> 52:08.291
Yes.

52:09.001 --> 52:11.586
- Emily and Theodore.
- Hello, sweethearts.

52:11.670 --> 52:13.713
- Hello.
- Aren't you gorgeous?

52:14.298 --> 52:16.508
Mrs. Charlton told me she was looking after them.

52:16.592 --> 52:18.134
I was wondering if I could throw mine in as well.

52:19.970 --> 52:21.221
This is Ruby.

52:22.223 --> 52:23.264
Go on, sugarplum,

52:23.349 --> 52:24.724
meet new friends.

52:26.894 --> 52:28.144
Doll is pretty.

52:28.687 --> 52:31.439
Would you mind? Us girls all help each other out here.

52:33.734 --> 52:34.901
Which girls?

52:35.361 --> 52:38.154
You know, the concubines.

52:39.490 --> 52:41.616
My fella just called. He's all hot and bothered.

52:41.700 --> 52:43.326
I didn't have time to make arrangements.

52:43.410 --> 52:45.411
I promise I'll do the same for you.

52:49.333 --> 52:51.251
Is this the three-bedroom?

52:53.337 --> 52:54.838
Yes, it is.

52:55.589 --> 52:56.589
Well,

52:57.758 --> 52:59.843
your fella's certainly sweet on you.

55:01.423 --> 55:02.799
God.

55:02.883 --> 55:04.550
There you go.

55:07.471 --> 55:08.888
I like that.

55:08.973 --> 55:11.307
What's going on behind those baby blues? Hmm?

55:14.269 --> 55:17.355
I try to be good. I really do.

55:21.110 --> 55:23.611
It's too late to be good tonight, dolly.
