WEBVTT

01:16.057 --> 01:17.443
Guy in a mask came in shooting.

01:17.443 --> 01:19.149
Three down, two dead.

01:19.149 --> 01:20.873
Bar closed at 4:00.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.771
Cleaners were finished by 5:00.

01:22.771 --> 01:24.500
These two were the owners.

01:25.031 --> 01:27.120
Miami trust fund babies.

01:27.304 --> 01:28.892
What about robbery?

01:28.892 --> 01:31.584
Cash drawers were cleaned out.
No witnesses yet.

01:33.073 --> 01:36.217
All right.
No gun, no bloodtrail,

01:36.217 --> 01:38.110
shooter entered cleanly...

01:38.934 --> 01:41.653
and exited cleanly, apparently.

01:42.482 --> 01:43.835
Who called this in?

01:43.835 --> 01:44.873
Third victim.

01:44.873 --> 01:46.199
Ricky Murdoch.

01:46.601 --> 01:47.605
How's he doing?

01:47.605 --> 01:50.544
He was hit on his shoulder and chest
paramedics just took him.

01:51.317 --> 01:52.999
So we've got a survivor.

02:00.705 --> 02:02.050
Ricky?

02:02.444 --> 02:05.100
Ricky, my name's Horatio Caine.
How you feeling?

02:05.532 --> 02:07.449
Like I just got shot.

02:07.969 --> 02:10.538
Now, listen, anything you can tell me

02:10.538 --> 02:13.313
about the man who did this
might help me catch him.

02:13.443 --> 02:14.843
What do you remember?

02:15.286 --> 02:17.347
He just came in and started shooting.

02:17.577 --> 02:19.409
We didn't have time to react or anything.

02:19.409 --> 02:21.082
So you didn't see his face.

02:21.279 --> 02:23.115
No, he was wearing a mask.

02:23.179 --> 02:24.777
Did he say anything?

02:25.274 --> 02:27.012
Just started shooting.

02:27.237 --> 02:28.586
Right. Okay.

02:29.554 --> 02:31.007
It's so weird.

02:31.153 --> 02:32.606
What's weird?

02:35.137 --> 02:36.858
I remember him shooting me once.

02:38.663 --> 02:40.063
But I was hit twice.

02:40.624 --> 02:42.095
Well, you know what
happens sometimes,

02:42.095 --> 02:45.896
trauma can affect our perception
of the situation,

02:46.505 --> 02:49.524
and the bad guys come to count on that.

02:50.414 --> 02:51.791
That means he's going to get away?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.349
What it means, Ricky,

02:53.349 --> 02:55.915
is that he doesn't understand
how evidence works.

02:56.117 --> 02:57.349
But you know what?

02:58.023 --> 02:59.215
He will.

03:35.028 --> 03:37.392
MIAMI
2x05 The Best Defense

03:52.275 --> 03:55.307
Justin Sayers and Brad Dawson.

03:55.496 --> 03:56.880
Co-owners.

03:57.911 --> 03:59.598
Not anymore.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.867
Club where people come

04:02.867 --> 04:05.350
when the door guy
turns you down everywhere else.

04:05.350 --> 04:07.847
So this is your hangout, speed.

04:08.357 --> 04:11.432
you know, did you ever think about
taking up standup comedy

04:11.432 --> 04:13.577
or something like that?
Because you're really very funny.

04:13.577 --> 04:15.412
Glad you noticed.
I appreciate it. Thanks.

04:16.015 --> 04:18.332
H mentioned the cocaine here.

04:19.728 --> 04:20.880
Let's see, the, uh,

04:20.880 --> 04:23.497
cleaning crew was done by 5:00.

04:23.650 --> 04:26.641
Our victims were probably doing
blow right before they got shot.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.459
Did you find any casings?

04:37.132 --> 04:40.655
No. I'm thinking that the suspect
must've used a revolver.

04:40.813 --> 04:42.831
Or he picked up after himself.

04:43.353 --> 04:46.720
Forethought or afterthought.
Either way, the guy's not stupid.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.555
We're dealing with
an organized criminal.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.852
Means he probably didn't
dump the gun nearby.

04:50.852 --> 04:52.703
But I'll check the dumpsters,
just in case.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.871
Cleaning crew didn't do a very good job.

04:59.181 --> 05:01.617
Still a lot of prints to process.

05:04.098 --> 05:05.509
or maybe just one.

05:10.408 --> 05:11.559
Licorice.

05:11.559 --> 05:13.314
Ouzo.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.841
Greek liqueur.

05:15.188 --> 05:18.594
Maybe our shooter had a quick shot
to steady his nerves before he left.

05:21.137 --> 05:23.284
We've got some smudges.

05:23.788 --> 05:25.413
Maybe a partial.

05:25.565 --> 05:27.051
It's a tough ask.

05:29.709 --> 05:31.217
That's got to be bad for you.

05:31.217 --> 05:32.675
That's gross.

05:32.823 --> 05:34.233
Bugs.

05:34.373 --> 05:37.405
They're attracted to the sweetness,
they go in right through the pourer.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.196
There are no bugs in the glass,

05:39.196 --> 05:41.381
so it must've been poured
from a different bottle.

05:45.085 --> 05:48.577
The best ouzo comes
from this greek island, lesbos.

05:49.491 --> 05:51.176
A connoisseur.

05:51.447 --> 05:54.700
Well, this girl, astrid,
took me to a greek wedding.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.331
Fresh bottle.

05:58.585 --> 06:00.088
And fresh print.

06:00.597 --> 06:02.028
Right there.

06:05.371 --> 06:06.937
That could be cocaine.

06:07.192 --> 06:08.558
Can't dust it.

06:09.427 --> 06:10.856
Better bring that to the lab.

06:10.856 --> 06:14.241
According to the vic, this cowboy came
through the front door, guns blazing.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.193
I wonder if he tied up his horse.

06:19.649 --> 06:21.650
Got a void the length of a car.

06:22.608 --> 06:24.723
Street sweeper came by.

06:31.370 --> 06:33.843
Left a scum residue everywhere but here.

06:34.457 --> 06:35.830
Let's, uh...

06:35.935 --> 06:38.000
let's check the time the
street sweeper came by.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.052
Maybe our guy's car was parked here.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.027
A little scum could break the whole case.

06:51.653 --> 06:52.617
Hi.

06:52.617 --> 06:53.822
Hi back.

06:53.822 --> 06:55.259
Hey...

06:55.259 --> 06:56.840
I found this in my car.

06:57.020 --> 06:58.056
Oh. Thanks.

06:58.056 --> 06:59.566
Think it fell off when we were...

06:59.566 --> 07:00.813
yeah.

07:01.470 --> 07:02.912
I, uh...

07:02.912 --> 07:05.619
I thought that you, uh,broke the moon roof.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.675
A friend of mine owns a convertible.

07:07.675 --> 07:10.139
If you're not doing anything friday night,
I was hoping...

07:10.139 --> 07:11.834
Dad! Hi. / Hey!

07:11.834 --> 07:13.784
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks. And you?

07:13.784 --> 07:15.752
- What are you doing here?
- How are you?

07:15.752 --> 07:16.939
Uh...

07:16.939 --> 07:20.013
this is a colleague of mine,
a friend of mine, John Hagen.

07:20.013 --> 07:21.734
- This is my dad.
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.

07:21.734 --> 07:23.849
- How do you do?
- If you'll forgive me, I have to run.

07:23.849 --> 07:25.117
So long.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.629
Nice fella.

07:27.963 --> 07:29.841
Okay, what's happened now?

07:29.841 --> 07:31.965
Why do you always make it sound so bad?

07:32.355 --> 07:33.635
Did mom take you back?

07:33.635 --> 07:36.276
No, but she might,
'cause I got myself in the rotation

07:36.276 --> 07:39.128
with the public defenders
at the miami-dade county court.

07:39.172 --> 07:41.359
That's great.
How'd you manage that?

07:41.359 --> 07:43.453
Old pal of mine,
works in the state's office,

07:43.453 --> 07:46.282
said he'd put me in the rotation
if I stayed sober.

07:46.282 --> 07:48.583
Last sunday, been 60 days.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.965
Congratulations, daddy.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.240
Thank you. / I wish I could stay
and hang out with you,

07:54.240 --> 07:56.966
but I'm working on a double. Will you
call me when they assign you a case?

07:56.966 --> 07:59.838
Well, they already have.
I wanted you to be the first to know.

08:01.788 --> 08:04.598
- Do you feel confident?
- Well, it's an easy one, truth be told.

08:04.598 --> 08:06.926
You know, my client's
already confessed.

08:06.926 --> 08:09.755
She stabbed her boyfriend
with a screwdriver.

08:09.755 --> 08:11.479
Well, what does the evidence say?

08:11.629 --> 08:14.184
- There wasn't any evidence.
- There's always evidence.

08:14.184 --> 08:16.886
I guess the police department
probably stopped processing it

08:16.886 --> 08:19.392
when she confessed and figured
they would undermine the case.

08:19.392 --> 08:22.187
You mean after she confesses,
they don't want to hear about it anymore?

08:22.187 --> 08:23.968
I thought they only did
that in the old days.

08:23.968 --> 08:27.044
I guess using legal advantage
never goes out of style.

08:27.044 --> 08:29.616
You can call the prosecutor,
and get ahold of the evidence.

08:29.727 --> 08:32.119
Yeah, I know, I know.
They might have a fight on their hands.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.926
I think they do.

08:34.018 --> 08:35.941
I'm on my cell,
if you need me. / Thanks!

08:36.549 --> 08:37.929
Brad Dawson.

08:38.202 --> 08:40.794
It took a bit of digging
to find the entry wound.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.373
But then he finally gave it up.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.848
The bullet entered
through the oral cavity,

08:45.848 --> 08:49.440
punctured the throat before coming
to rest in the middle cerebella.

08:50.549 --> 08:54.060
No powder burns around the lips
or in the oral cavity.

08:54.543 --> 08:56.070
His mouth was open.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.164
He must've been talking.

08:58.735 --> 09:00.195
Or screaming.

09:00.370 --> 09:01.785
No!

09:05.121 --> 09:06.118
Alexx,

09:06.118 --> 09:08.809
what about Justin over here?
Let's take a look at him.

09:10.048 --> 09:13.264
Found traces of cocaine
in Justin's nasal passage.

09:13.414 --> 09:14.788
More in his system.

09:14.941 --> 09:18.454
Bullet entered the left cheek
on an upward trajectory,

09:18.454 --> 09:20.302
lodged into the frontal lobe.

09:20.302 --> 09:21.941
He died of exanguination.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.296
Take a look at these, Alexx.

09:25.138 --> 09:27.335
His knuckles are bruid and scraped.

09:28.186 --> 09:29.493
That's not all.

09:29.493 --> 09:31.195
Found skin under his fingernails.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.608
Sent a sample to DNA.

09:32.710 --> 09:34.493
How much skin? / A lot.

09:34.546 --> 09:36.129
Accordion style.

09:38.379 --> 09:40.159
Kid put up a fight.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.343
That's not the version I heard.

09:51.994 --> 09:53.552
Thank you, Monica.

09:53.806 --> 09:54.706
Thank you.

09:55.257 --> 09:57.368
Your doctor said you were very lucky.

09:57.767 --> 10:00.023
Yeah, yeah, the bullet just...

10:00.411 --> 10:01.761
barely missed my heart.

10:01.761 --> 10:02.803
That is lucky.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.451
It's my understanding that

10:04.451 --> 10:07.152
Brad, Justin and you were friends.

10:07.152 --> 10:08.351
We met at the club,

10:08.351 --> 10:09.339
yeah.

10:10.004 --> 10:12.531
They let me shadow them. I just
wanted to see how the business worked.

10:12.531 --> 10:16.056
Long hours, hard work and
all the cocaine you can snort, right?

10:18.853 --> 10:20.174
They were into it.

10:20.367 --> 10:21.595
I wasn't really.

10:21.595 --> 10:24.594
Here's the thing, Ricky.
We found a great deal of skin

10:24.594 --> 10:26.673
under justin's fingernails

10:26.812 --> 10:30.001
and the only way that could get there
would be as a result of a struggle.

10:30.001 --> 10:32.296
Now, your version of the story

10:32.296 --> 10:34.145
is that the shooter entered,

10:34.145 --> 10:37.367
fired and left immediately,

10:37.540 --> 10:39.645
so I'm confused.

10:40.971 --> 10:44.611
What...? / I need you
to let me see your arms.

10:45.113 --> 10:46.449
Ricky!

10:46.857 --> 10:48.833
I came as soon as I heard.
Is everything all right?

10:48.833 --> 10:52.667
Yeah. / I'm Aaron Schecter.
I represent the Murdoch family.

10:54.555 --> 10:57.307
Murdoch sugar. / That's right.
"The sweet life. "

10:57.307 --> 10:59.313
Biggest conglomerate
in north or south america.

10:59.313 --> 11:00.691
Who am I dealing with?

11:00.691 --> 11:02.874
- Uh, we're with the city.
- Okay, that's great.

11:02.874 --> 11:05.802
Listen, it's very important that the Murdoch
family name is protected at all times.

11:05.802 --> 11:09.441
The media, unfortunately,
tends to seize on things like this.

11:09.441 --> 11:11.565
Is there anything I can tell them
about the investigation?

11:11.565 --> 11:14.168
You can tell them that young ricky here

11:14.168 --> 11:16.358
is lying about his participation in a murder.

11:16.358 --> 11:18.113
I'm sure he misspoke due to trauma.

11:18.113 --> 11:20.598
Ricky, this is your chance to clear this up.

11:20.598 --> 11:22.178
Ricky's said all he's going to say today.

11:22.178 --> 11:25.010
Are you sure you want this man speaking for you?

11:30.984 --> 11:32.888
That's the way it is in my family.

11:34.619 --> 11:35.877
Okay.

11:35.877 --> 11:37.450
To be continued.

11:46.041 --> 11:48.280
You I.D. The powder that left this print?

11:48.280 --> 11:50.580
Yeah. Cocaine hydrochloride.

11:51.931 --> 11:54.272
Delko, don't take this personally, man,

11:54.792 --> 11:56.531
but you stink.

11:57.171 --> 12:00.275
Look, man, I've been crawling around
in dumpsters all day looking for a gun,

12:00.275 --> 12:02.179
all right? / Well, I hope you
at least found the thing.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.303
No, I didn't, as a matter of fact.

12:04.303 --> 12:06.412
Joseph, why don't you give me the print on the bottle

12:06.412 --> 12:08.195
and stop talking about where I've been and

12:08.195 --> 12:09.346
how I smell?

12:09.346 --> 12:11.564
Photometric stereo imaging.

12:11.736 --> 12:15.433
Captures the 3-d visible print
off a surface not suitable for lifting.

12:17.725 --> 12:20.151
See, with each angle of light,

12:20.151 --> 12:22.635
the texture of the bottle's surface changes,

12:22.635 --> 12:25.678
illuminating a different section of the fingerprint.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.113
Then we download them,

12:37.283 --> 12:40.663
run them through the software
and we get...

12:40.811 --> 12:43.166
A three-dimensional image of a fingerprint.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.812
Then all I have to do is suppress the image texture,

12:45.812 --> 12:47.837
run it through a linear filter...

12:49.030 --> 12:51.494
like magic.
3-d to 2-D.

12:51.881 --> 12:53.633
Workable print.

12:53.764 --> 12:55.880
That's great. Run that
through AFIS for me, will you?

12:56.133 --> 12:57.282
Done.

13:06.717 --> 13:09.386
Mr. Angelo Sedaris.

13:09.386 --> 13:10.885
Club owner.

13:10.885 --> 13:14.211
All applicants for a liquor license
have to get fingerprinted.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.085
His club's called "silenus. "

13:16.085 --> 13:19.689
Yeah. And he's located less than a blockfrom the crime scene.

13:19.689 --> 13:22.597
Silenus- a guy in greek mythologywho liked to party.

13:22.597 --> 13:25.005
So Angelo has a sense of humor.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.814
I wonder if he's heard the one
about the guy who walks into the bar

13:27.814 --> 13:29.729
and starts shooting people.

13:30.248 --> 13:32.366
I stopped by on the way home.

13:32.656 --> 13:34.423
Club owners, we do that.

13:35.051 --> 13:38.021
The only other people that's going to be up is one of us.

13:38.021 --> 13:39.096
What time?

13:39.096 --> 13:40.267
5:30.

13:40.267 --> 13:41.896
Gone by 6:00.

13:41.896 --> 13:44.431
Play all night, sleep all day.

13:46.114 --> 13:49.235
Justin tried to serve me a shot of cheap ouzo.

13:49.235 --> 13:51.214
Loser. / Justin's a loser

13:51.214 --> 13:54.339
because you are a top-shelf guywho likes expensive ouzo and

13:54.339 --> 13:56.701
has a very expensive cocaine habit.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.846
I don't do blow.

14:00.331 --> 14:01.647
Herb's more my style.

14:01.647 --> 14:04.195
You had cocaine all over your fingers, Angelo.

14:04.195 --> 14:07.068
That's how the lab was able to get your print.

14:09.954 --> 14:13.097
How did you injure your hand, Angelo?

14:15.116 --> 14:16.727
It could have been anywhere,
I don't know. / But it wasn't-

14:16.727 --> 14:20.189
it was at the club, while you and
Justin were fighting over that cocaine.

14:20.189 --> 14:22.897
- Just before you shot him.
- I didn't shoot anyone.

14:28.713 --> 14:30.324
Okay.

14:30.712 --> 14:34.103
Justin and Brad stopped by the club earlier.

14:34.246 --> 14:37.836
I let them punks in my vip,
and what do they do?

14:49.866 --> 14:51.847
so I went back to get it.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.374
Have a drink, Angelo. / Man...

14:55.797 --> 14:57.245
you take my coke,

14:57.245 --> 14:59.526
I take your good ouzo.

15:04.092 --> 15:06.479
I wasn't about to leave my coke.

15:06.632 --> 15:09.991
Hey, yo, gimme that.
This is my stuff. / Hey!

15:18.403 --> 15:20.226
I didn't shoot them.

15:20.885 --> 15:23.404
I just took the rest of my stuff and went home.

15:25.154 --> 15:29.144
Angelo just comped to cocaine possession.

15:29.446 --> 15:31.398
Woops.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.980
I'm going to need to examine
your car. / For what?

15:35.797 --> 15:37.230
For scum.

15:51.487 --> 15:54.348
Angelo's got nice taste in cars.

15:54.500 --> 15:57.024
Hard to go wrong when you spend 80 grand.

15:58.242 --> 16:00.587
So, I checked with city maintenance.

16:00.735 --> 16:02.776
The sweeper that works that street

16:02.776 --> 16:05.817
does it around 7:45,
give or take a couple of minutes.

16:05.817 --> 16:07.939
Rescue got the call at 7:55.

16:07.939 --> 16:10.352
And Angelo said he was gone by 6:00.

16:10.557 --> 16:13.100
If we put his car on the scene,
we've caught him in a lie.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.920
Hey, let me ask you a question.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.230
Why would you add
a cheap compact disk player

16:18.230 --> 16:20.716
on to a top-of-the-line
german audio system?

16:22.120 --> 16:23.578
Well, you wouldn'T.

16:26.794 --> 16:28.292
That's cute.

16:35.101 --> 16:36.427
.22 revolver..

16:36.427 --> 16:38.525
just like the rounds we found in our victims.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.392
So, you'll process Angelo's gun,

16:43.392 --> 16:45.969
- I'll brief Horatio?
- I'll be in firearms.

16:46.174 --> 16:47.456
Calleigh. / Hi, dad.

16:47.456 --> 16:49.022
Got discovery.

16:49.022 --> 16:50.571
Looked at the trace results,

16:50.571 --> 16:53.301
and there was motor oil in the boyfriend's stab wounds.

16:53.301 --> 16:55.634
I don't know any of the particulars of the case, dad.

16:55.634 --> 16:57.614
I don't think my girl did it.

16:57.747 --> 16:59.949
Really? / Yeah, I believe that the evidence

16:59.949 --> 17:02.586
is beginning to contradict her confession.

17:05.348 --> 17:06.732
Okay.

17:06.732 --> 17:08.834
Case history.
Start with the oil.

17:09.098 --> 17:10.118
Okay.

17:10.118 --> 17:12.195
Gloria Haberfield,
19 years old,

17:12.195 --> 17:13.351
sitting, uh...

17:13.351 --> 17:15.979
with her paramour, Duane
Edmunds, in his car.

17:15.979 --> 17:17.643
They get into an argument.

17:17.643 --> 17:19.584
- Don't listen. That's your promiss... - I do listen...

17:19.584 --> 17:21.252
Duane you don't listen to me.

17:24.934 --> 17:29.500
and here, the police allege
that Gloria reached into the glove box,

17:29.500 --> 17:31.584
took out a screwdriver

17:31.584 --> 17:33.914
and stabbed Duane.

17:33.914 --> 17:35.589
Stabbed him and stabbed him and stabbed him

17:35.589 --> 17:37.112
like a friend of Julius Caesar.

17:39.870 --> 17:43.206
It says here that the police have an eyewitnessthat saw everything.

17:51.148 --> 17:52.671
she thought she did.

17:52.671 --> 17:55.182
Late night, looking through glass.

17:55.182 --> 17:57.513
And I've been asking around.
This kid, Duane,

17:57.513 --> 17:59.350
his car has got a faulty carburetor,

17:59.350 --> 18:03.497
so he keeps a screwdriver
on hand in the car to adjust, you know,

18:03.497 --> 18:04.690
for cold starts.

18:04.690 --> 18:06.685
Okay, explain it to me in context, dad.

18:06.685 --> 18:07.999
Well, if it was me,

18:07.999 --> 18:11.121
why would I keep that screw driver way
over there in that glove compartment,

18:11.121 --> 18:14.939
when he could keep it right by his side,
right there in the door side pocket,

18:14.939 --> 18:16.584
nice and handy?

18:16.584 --> 18:18.143
So in order for the girl to attack him,

18:18.143 --> 18:20.637
she would've had to have reached
across his body and grab it.

18:20.637 --> 18:23.533
Exactly, but that doesn't make
any sense, now, does it? No.

18:23.533 --> 18:24.964
But what does make sense is,

18:24.964 --> 18:29.888
he gets mad, he reaches down,
he grabs for that trusty old screwdriver...

18:30.972 --> 18:33.136
and he attacks her.

18:39.224 --> 18:41.719
you got a case for
self-defense right there.

18:41.719 --> 18:45.748
I just think you're going to have to have more
than motor oil in a stab wound to prove it.

18:46.027 --> 18:48.134
That's why I want them
to take a look at this car.

18:48.284 --> 18:53.443
Blood analysis, weapon strikes,
and tool marks on the interior.

18:53.443 --> 18:55.332
Tool marks are my specialty.

18:55.332 --> 18:57.457
Well, as much as I like
our pleasant conversation...

18:57.457 --> 18:59.478
dad, it's already been assigned
to another criminalist.

18:59.478 --> 19:01.303
He's a good csi-
his name's Eric.

19:01.303 --> 19:04.624
Good as he may be,
he is no rival for my little lamb chop.

19:07.495 --> 19:11.093
All right, I promise you that I will
check in on things and I will observe,

19:11.093 --> 19:14.434
but I have to work on my own case
or Horatio's going to have my hide.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.300
Good. Go get 'em.

20:05.985 --> 20:07.333
Hey, John.

20:07.333 --> 20:08.859
What'd you tell your father?

20:08.859 --> 20:12.055
Excuse me? / Prosecutor just called
me in the haberfield case.

20:12.055 --> 20:16.266
Your father persuaded his client to change
her plea about stabbing her boyfriend.

20:16.377 --> 20:18.624
- That's your case?
- Like you didn't know that.

20:18.624 --> 20:21.865
No, I didn't know that. I've been
trying to stay at arm's length about it.

20:21.865 --> 20:23.498
What'd you tell him, Calleigh?

20:24.075 --> 20:26.323
I told him that he should
take a look at the evidence,

20:26.323 --> 20:27.715
which is what I would
have told any attorney.

20:27.715 --> 20:29.523
Great. Well, now my suspect
changed her story.

20:29.523 --> 20:31.236
Well, you know what, John?
That's her right.

20:31.236 --> 20:33.568
Just like it's the state's
right to take it to trial.

20:33.568 --> 20:35.721
This is B.S. Total B.S.

20:35.721 --> 20:38.939
Hey, are you more upset about the
constitution or about your arrest jacket?

20:38.939 --> 20:41.275
I care about a confession
she freely gave me that.

20:41.275 --> 20:43.895
- Now she's saying I coerced.
- Well, John, if the evidence is good,

20:43.895 --> 20:46.332
then the confession will stick.

20:46.332 --> 20:50.301
- Whose side are you on?
- I didn't realize that evidence took sides.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.687
Is this urgent, detective?

20:57.453 --> 20:58.695
It can wait.

21:12.465 --> 21:13.741
You okay?

21:13.741 --> 21:15.270
You know it.

21:17.508 --> 21:20.493
Okay. Angelo's gun.

21:21.563 --> 21:23.866
I've gotten a little sidetracked.

21:24.099 --> 21:26.228
All right. What have you got?

21:26.434 --> 21:27.894
Uh, basically,

21:27.894 --> 21:29.778
the bullet striations don't match,

21:29.778 --> 21:32.514
so this wasn't the gun that was
used to shoot the two victims,

21:32.514 --> 21:34.934
and the club owner,
Angelo, was telling us the truth.

21:34.934 --> 21:38.991
Okay, so our only confirmed liar,
then, is Ricky Murdoch.

21:38.991 --> 21:40.626
Yeah. / All right.

21:42.901 --> 21:45.048
What are you looking for exactly?

21:46.508 --> 21:48.675
Something's not right, Alexx.

21:48.832 --> 21:50.010
Such as?

21:50.010 --> 21:51.531
Let's talk about timeline.

21:51.531 --> 21:55.254
Is it possible Justin died earlier
than was in your report?

21:55.254 --> 21:58.410
I examined both the bodies in the bar
just after 9:00 A.M.-

21:58.410 --> 22:00.112
Blood had just begun to settle.

22:00.112 --> 22:02.192
Was there any indication of rigor?

22:02.192 --> 22:04.657
Slight stiffening in the eye
muscles, that's all.

22:04.657 --> 22:08.067
Right, so what is the earliest
he could have died?

22:08.067 --> 22:09.565
Mm, 6:30.

22:09.565 --> 22:11.537
6:30. What about latest?

22:11.844 --> 22:14.817
7:15, 7:30 at the outside.

22:14.982 --> 22:16.831
7:30 at the outside.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.516
So rescue got a call-out at 7:58.

22:21.142 --> 22:24.055
Sounds like Ricky has
a problem with his timeline.

22:24.055 --> 22:25.953
Right. He's missing an hour.

22:27.154 --> 22:28.999
I wonder if his lawyer knows that.

22:28.999 --> 22:32.035
This weapon was found
15 minutes ago in a dumpster

22:32.035 --> 22:36.267
behind a club by a private security
firm hired by the Murdoch family.

22:36.267 --> 22:39.815
Miami-dade police have confirmed
that the owner of the club,

22:39.815 --> 22:41.533
an Angelo Sedaris,

22:41.533 --> 22:43.426
is being questioned in the shooting.

22:43.426 --> 22:46.725
Didn't your guys already look
at that club owner's gun and rule it out?

22:46.725 --> 22:50.061
Yes, we did, but the public
doesn't know that, do they?

22:50.061 --> 22:52.702
To solve these brutal attacks.
To help,

22:52.702 --> 22:57.352
the Murdoch family is posting
a reward of a half a million dollars

22:57.352 --> 23:00.963
to any information that
leads to an arrest.

23:01.204 --> 23:02.256
Thank you.

23:02.497 --> 23:03.568
Thank you, Aaron.

23:07.407 --> 23:08.239
Gentlemen.

23:08.239 --> 23:11.099
H, we searched the trash in
a three-block radius for that gun.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.149
And?

23:12.149 --> 23:14.129
It's got to be a stunt.
It's not the murder weapon.

23:14.129 --> 23:16.144
No, it is the murder weapon.
It was cleaned

23:16.144 --> 23:17.887
and dropped where we could find it.

23:18.238 --> 23:20.085
- By who?
- By Ricky's attorney.

23:20.085 --> 23:22.442
Why would ricky's attorney hand
us the murder weapon?

23:22.442 --> 23:25.576
Because Ricky's got a smart attorney,
and he knows we're looking at his client.

23:25.576 --> 23:26.857
He'll try to get ahead of us.

23:26.857 --> 23:29.462
So now let's get ahead of him.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.246
Mr. Schecter.

23:41.138 --> 23:44.379
The security staff that found the gun
gave it to me immediately afterwards.

23:44.379 --> 23:47.483
It has not left my possession.
The chain of evidence is preserved.

23:49.550 --> 23:50.884
How helpful.

23:51.845 --> 23:52.904
You know, Aaron,

23:52.904 --> 23:55.637
some might call this hiding in plain sight.

23:55.637 --> 23:58.179
I hope you're not suggesting that
Ricky had prior knowledge of

23:58.179 --> 24:00.091
that gun's whereabouts
or any part in this tragedy?

24:00.091 --> 24:02.438
Well, I guess that depends, doesn't it?

24:02.741 --> 24:06.306
It depends on where Ricky was
between the time of the murder

24:06.923 --> 24:10.271
- and the 911 call.
- Struggling to stay conscious.

24:10.499 --> 24:12.386
He's an innocent victim of
a random shooting.

24:12.386 --> 24:15.647
By a masked man who killed two
of his friends and then spared him.

24:15.647 --> 24:16.587
- I remember.
- What are you implying?

24:16.587 --> 24:18.636
I'm not implying anything, Aaron.

24:18.636 --> 24:21.184
What I want is to see the
bullet hits on his body.

24:21.184 --> 24:24.141
- Oh, that's going to take a warrant.
- Not necessarily.

24:25.315 --> 24:27.815
What are you getting at, lieutenant?
What are you doing?

24:28.055 --> 24:29.417
Aaron,

24:29.417 --> 24:32.042
you will be first to know.

24:36.198 --> 24:37.244
Speed...

24:37.404 --> 24:39.738
I want to find the shirt that Ricky
wore when he got shot.

24:39.738 --> 24:41.365
The paramedics cut it off him.

24:41.365 --> 24:43.509
- You want to test it for lead?
- Yeah, here's what I want to do.

24:43.509 --> 24:45.013
I want to reconstruct the shooting.

24:45.013 --> 24:47.651
Start close and work back
for distance, all right?

24:47.651 --> 24:49.679
Arm's length first. / Good.

24:50.274 --> 24:51.366
You got it.

25:05.849 --> 25:07.456
Viscous substance.

25:07.820 --> 25:09.474
Doesn't look like motor oil.

25:10.204 --> 25:11.928
Won't know until I test it.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.392
You know she stabbed
him eight times?

25:18.392 --> 25:20.882
Yeah, you've told me
that eight times,

25:20.882 --> 25:24.142
and it still doesn't change
what I have to do here.

25:37.706 --> 25:38.941
You find something?

25:40.385 --> 25:41.975
I'm not sure yet.

25:57.447 --> 25:59.842
- That could be anything.
- I wouldn't bother.

26:03.222 --> 26:04.616
It's no bother.

26:23.237 --> 26:25.961
That looks like it could've been
done with a screwdriver.

26:26.944 --> 26:28.898
I thought you were going
to be hands off.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.827
Do you see any hands?

26:31.930 --> 26:34.309
But you're going to
check it, right? / Yes.

26:34.429 --> 26:36.863
As a matter of fact,
I'm just finishing up right now.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.643
You're worse than Hagen.

26:39.008 --> 26:40.723
Did Hagen ask you to check that?

26:40.723 --> 26:43.198
No, actually, he asked
me not to bother.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.891
That's interesting.

26:47.910 --> 26:50.968
The indent matches the business
end of the screwdriver.

26:50.968 --> 26:53.220
And there isn't a drop of blood on it.

26:54.426 --> 26:57.265
So it could have been the boyfriend's
first act of aggression.

27:03.559 --> 27:07.759
which could mean that everything
she did after that was self-defense.

27:07.759 --> 27:10.709
Dad, you walk as quiet as a mouse.

27:10.709 --> 27:13.329
Young man, you gonna put that
in your report, right?

27:13.469 --> 27:14.567
Okay, then

27:14.567 --> 27:16.745
- got a case to prepare.
- Well, it's just a start, dad.

27:16.745 --> 27:19.221
I know, I know there's
other stuff to analyze,

27:19.221 --> 27:21.509
but that colleague of yours,
detective Hagen?

27:21.509 --> 27:24.383
I'll put him in the box.
Get his feet to the fire,

27:24.383 --> 27:26.598
Okay, then. Bye, sweetie.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.535
I appreciate it, young man.

27:28.535 --> 27:30.129
Just doing my job, sir.

27:34.094 --> 27:36.997
Your old man doesn't know about
you and Hagen, does he?

27:37.296 --> 27:38.795
I didn't know that you knew it.

27:38.795 --> 27:40.012
Oh, right.

27:40.012 --> 27:41.545
Big secret.

27:41.883 --> 27:43.562
Does everybody know?

27:44.292 --> 27:45.481
Calleigh, we're CSIs.

27:45.481 --> 27:48.989
I mean, if we can't figure something
going on between two people, then...

27:49.975 --> 27:52.521
did he really ask you not
to look at the seat belt?

27:57.622 --> 27:58.831
Hey, John.

27:59.672 --> 28:00.741
Hey.

28:00.741 --> 28:03.561
I just wanted to ask you
something face-to-face.

28:03.561 --> 28:06.352
Did you try and overlook evidence
with regard to the seat belt?

28:06.352 --> 28:08.003
- I didn't think it was important.
- A tool mark

28:08.003 --> 28:11.021
on the accused girl's seat belt
in this case and it's not important?

28:11.021 --> 28:13.225
If it doesn't establish
a specific window of time...

28:13.225 --> 28:16.227
a case is the totality of evidence,
and you know that.

28:16.227 --> 28:17.900
Come on. That's CSI talk.

28:17.900 --> 28:21.448
I'm a cop. I got an eyewitness
and a signed confession

28:21.448 --> 28:25.837
and an old man blowing my whole case
apart to pull himself up out of the bottle.

28:28.311 --> 28:30.220
- I didn't mean that.
- I think you did.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.794
And you know what?
As we speak,

28:32.794 --> 28:36.074
that "old man" may be trying to save
the life of an innocent woman.

28:36.243 --> 28:38.898
You know what?
I don't think friday night's going to work.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.078
Yeah.

28:40.198 --> 28:41.545
I couldn't agree more.

29:02.420 --> 29:03.824
Ricky's shirt?

29:03.824 --> 29:06.525
You were right. Paramedics had it.
No warrant necessary.

29:06.525 --> 29:08.854
Okay... what about
comparable distance?

29:08.854 --> 29:10.153
Three feet.

29:10.153 --> 29:14.027
Left the same amount of residue
around the entry tear that ricky's had.

29:14.776 --> 29:16.692
So, based on the powder burns alone,

29:16.692 --> 29:20.322
it's would have been physically
impossible for Ricky to shoot himself.

29:20.466 --> 29:22.225
Somebody else fired the gun.

29:26.424 --> 29:29.602
What about the partial print
on the ouzo glass?

29:29.757 --> 29:31.607
There's no match on AFIS.

29:32.467 --> 29:33.531
Okay.

29:33.990 --> 29:35.270
All right, here's what I want to do:

29:35.270 --> 29:38.513
Let's contact the east
coast bar association.

29:38.513 --> 29:39.969
Check with them, all right?

29:52.401 --> 29:53.855
Well, gentlemen,

29:53.855 --> 29:55.980
it looks like our lawyer...

29:56.207 --> 29:58.191
is going to need a lawyer.

29:58.271 --> 29:59.826
Ricky's resting.

29:59.975 --> 30:01.027
He couldn't make it.

30:01.027 --> 30:02.843
That's fine. I didn't want
to speak to ricky anyway.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.844
You know, Aaron,
what I was thiining was

30:04.844 --> 30:10.822
how long it would take a guy
wearing a $5,000 suit to get it dirty?

30:11.209 --> 30:13.082
Is there something you
wanted to ask me?

30:13.082 --> 30:14.958
The club tropos, Aaron,

30:14.958 --> 30:16.246
have you ever been there?

30:16.246 --> 30:17.574
Yesterday morning.

30:17.574 --> 30:18.950
First time.

30:20.957 --> 30:22.303
You neglected to mention that.

30:22.303 --> 30:24.072
I was doing business with ricky.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.978
Meeting Ricky on business.

30:25.978 --> 30:27.195
And when you got there,

30:27.195 --> 30:29.813
Justin and Brad were
dead already, right?

30:29.813 --> 30:32.558
Which means your client was
facing a double murder charge and

30:32.558 --> 30:34.682
you had to think of something fast.

30:35.754 --> 30:36.690
What am I going to do?

30:36.690 --> 30:38.728
Listen to me.
There was a robbery.

30:38.728 --> 30:40.973
A man came in,
he was wearing a mask.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.622
He killed both your friends,
you were injured.

30:42.622 --> 30:43.883
You were injured.

30:44.918 --> 30:45.849
Take it.

30:45.849 --> 30:46.847
No, no, I can'T...

30:46.847 --> 30:48.754
it'll be so fast,
you won't even feel it. Take it.

30:48.754 --> 30:50.935
I can't! / Ricky...

30:52.742 --> 30:54.119
what am I going to do?

30:54.119 --> 30:56.061
Just think of something, Aaron!

30:56.204 --> 30:58.540
Tell me, what am I going to do?!

30:59.696 --> 31:01.389
it went wrong!

31:02.507 --> 31:03.938
Pick a shoulder, ricky. / What?!

31:03.938 --> 31:05.961
Pick a shoulder, left or right.
You gotta have a favorite.

31:05.961 --> 31:07.889
No... no...

31:08.588 --> 31:10.153
I met with my client.

31:10.153 --> 31:12.911
I had a glass of ouzo and then
I left and went back to my office.

31:12.911 --> 31:15.827
- What time was that?
- 7:00. No later.

31:17.406 --> 31:19.399
You're lying. / Say I am.

31:19.399 --> 31:21.828
Say I shot my own client for looks.

31:21.828 --> 31:24.960
Why would I shoot the kid twice?
Near his heart, no less.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.519
Why?

31:26.519 --> 31:29.945
Aaron, I'm going to let
the gun tell me that.

31:29.945 --> 31:31.813
What are you talking about?

31:31.895 --> 31:33.975
See you in court.

32:02.634 --> 32:04.178
I'm so tired of you.
I'll do what I want to! / I am the man!

32:04.178 --> 32:05.313
- Why are doing this to me?
- I will do it!

32:05.313 --> 32:06.627
I am the man!

32:06.627 --> 32:07.924
What'd I say?

32:07.924 --> 32:09.193
I told you...

32:44.232 --> 32:45.978
Hi. This is CSI Calleigh Duquesne.

32:45.978 --> 32:49.143
I need to speak to the prosecutor
in the haberfield case, please.

32:49.584 --> 32:50.855
Thank you.

32:50.992 --> 32:52.274
I'll hold.

32:53.152 --> 32:55.268
Didn't the state's attorney
explain this to you?

32:55.268 --> 32:58.112
'Cause information like this is
supposed to come out of his office.

32:58.112 --> 32:59.681
Well, yes, he did, but

32:59.681 --> 33:01.776
yeah, I'd like to hear it from you.

33:03.243 --> 33:06.183
Well, she killed him, dad.

33:06.358 --> 33:08.540
In self-defense. / No.

33:09.461 --> 33:12.250
Well, this blood pattern,
for this to have occurred,

33:12.250 --> 33:16.638
his head would have had to
have been forward and down.

33:18.354 --> 33:20.813
As if he were unconscious.

33:21.071 --> 33:25.109
And the person has to be alive
to bleed, and this spatter

33:25.624 --> 33:30.148
is very distinctive.
This is an arterial blood spray.

33:30.148 --> 33:31.706
This is...

33:31.933 --> 33:34.818
well, it's the stab wound
that killed him and...

33:35.288 --> 33:37.692
she would have had to
have lifted his head

33:37.692 --> 33:39.914
back off his chest.

33:47.660 --> 33:49.978
That's all here in the evidence,
I guess.

33:49.978 --> 33:51.764
Basically...

33:52.152 --> 33:55.714
Duane attacked her,
and she defended herself, but...

33:55.914 --> 33:57.636
she didn't have to kill him.

33:59.304 --> 34:02.904
He stopped being a threat
as soon as he was unconscious.

34:03.145 --> 34:04.746
Yeah.

34:07.918 --> 34:11.063
Well, I shouldn't have rejected
that deal they were offering.

34:13.274 --> 34:15.590
I just buried my client.

34:16.094 --> 34:17.502
No.

34:17.716 --> 34:20.408
Hey, daddy, you're doing a great job,

34:20.408 --> 34:24.592
and you're a good man.
Don't ever start thinking that you're not.

34:27.208 --> 34:29.175
Do you want to go have some dinner?

34:29.563 --> 34:30.820
No...

34:30.820 --> 34:33.190
don't start worrying about me now.

34:33.190 --> 34:35.460
I.. I'm not going to do something stupid,

34:35.460 --> 34:37.815
drown my sorrows, you know.

34:37.969 --> 34:40.437
I love your mama too much for that.

34:42.623 --> 34:44.944
I just need a little bit of alone time.

34:44.944 --> 34:46.699
Contemplate things.

34:49.706 --> 34:51.389
See you.

35:08.593 --> 35:10.680
How concerned
she might be about you.

35:11.246 --> 35:12.684
I'm fine.

35:12.784 --> 35:14.103
You sure?

35:14.355 --> 35:15.575
Yeah.

35:16.096 --> 35:16.976
Okay.

35:17.751 --> 35:19.878
These are the bullets
they dug out of Ricky.

35:19.878 --> 35:22.658
Right. Looks like one of
them's been shaved off.

35:22.807 --> 35:25.679
Sometimes the cylinders aren't
correctly aligned with the barrel.

35:25.679 --> 35:27.353
There's something else.

35:27.885 --> 35:30.490
He was shot twice, wasn't he?

35:30.642 --> 35:32.858
You're not thinking about
a sympathetic discharge, are you?

35:32.858 --> 35:35.906
- 'Cause I've only ever read about that.
- You read about it because it happens.

35:35.906 --> 35:38.870
You squeeze the trigger once,
the gun fires twice,

35:38.870 --> 35:43.627
yet only a single round is
emitted from the barrel cleanly.

35:43.627 --> 35:46.155
The second one gets
compressed by the recoil,

35:46.155 --> 35:48.319
comes out an adjacent chamber,

35:48.319 --> 35:50.590
producing a second
accidental discharge.

35:50.590 --> 35:51.654
Right.

35:51.654 --> 35:54.061
Only happens with poorly made guns.

36:00.462 --> 36:03.880
So, Aaron lines up
on Ricky's shoulder...

36:04.020 --> 36:05.286
pick a shoulder.
You got to have a favorite.

36:05.286 --> 36:06.546
Left or right?
Pick a shoulder.

36:06.546 --> 36:07.890
You don't have to do this.

36:07.890 --> 36:09.783
Just one shot. One shot.

36:09.783 --> 36:13.829
The gun misfires and
it's the sympathetic projectile

36:14.006 --> 36:15.863
that hits him in the chest.

36:17.722 --> 36:19.849
No! yaah!

36:25.364 --> 36:27.710
You're till gonna have to put
the gun in the lawyer's hand.

36:27.710 --> 36:29.080
Yes, I am.

36:30.294 --> 36:31.845
Schecter cleaned it.

36:32.271 --> 36:33.650
Let's check it again.

36:39.163 --> 36:40.686
Are you sure this is legal, sir?

36:40.686 --> 36:43.023
Taking samples from Mr. Schecter's car?

36:43.205 --> 36:45.059
Is this a public parking lot?

36:45.059 --> 36:46.327
Yes.

36:46.669 --> 36:47.907
Then it's legal.

36:49.430 --> 36:51.255
Horatio? / Yes, ma'am.

36:53.658 --> 36:55.190
So, Ricky's company?

36:55.190 --> 36:58.772
Ricky's company bought a building
right across the street from tropos.

36:58.772 --> 37:01.832
- He was planning on opening a club.
- Not without a liquor license.

37:01.832 --> 37:03.481
He applied to the state.

37:03.481 --> 37:05.911
But our victims' bar was so close,

37:05.911 --> 37:07.433
they wouldn't issue one.

37:07.433 --> 37:13.328
"Denied. " You see, this is where
a family attorney earns his money.

37:37.538 --> 37:40.102
I found a fiber lodged
in the trigger of the gun.

37:40.102 --> 37:41.542
Is it probative?

37:41.542 --> 37:42.853
It's a fine wool.

37:42.853 --> 37:45.595
It's 14.5 microns.

37:45.595 --> 37:48.693
That's thinner than human hair.
It was also weld with silk.

37:48.838 --> 37:52.707
Fine wool and silk, traditionally used to
make very expensive italian suits.

37:52.707 --> 37:54.461
Nice going, calleigh. Speed?

37:54.671 --> 37:56.572
I got a match on the car.

37:56.714 --> 37:59.942
Same detergents,
same disinfectants, same scum.

37:59.942 --> 38:02.521
Lawyer's car was parked outside
the bar when it was swept.

38:02.521 --> 38:03.963
Excellent.

38:05.209 --> 38:08.175
I hope you have good
cause for bringing us here.

38:08.413 --> 38:09.864
How would murd be?

38:09.864 --> 38:11.857
It'd be great if you had the evidence.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.210
Ricky has a company.

38:13.322 --> 38:16.961
- Ricky has lots of companies.
- That's actually quite true.

38:17.204 --> 38:20.079
Ricky has many companies,
but the company

38:20.157 --> 38:23.418
that she's referring to
was planning to open a club

38:23.418 --> 38:25.985
directly across the street from tropos.

38:26.158 --> 38:29.290
Ricky's money was going to
provide the liquor license,

38:29.290 --> 38:33.233
and Justin and Brad had been
tapped to run the club.

38:33.233 --> 38:35.675
- Wasn't that the deal?
- There was no deal, lieutenant.

38:35.675 --> 38:37.793
You lied, Aaron.
There was no deal,

38:37.793 --> 38:40.379
because Justin and Brad backed out,

38:40.518 --> 38:42.838
and you got angry, didn't you, Ricky?

38:43.298 --> 38:44.102
Anything!

38:44.102 --> 38:46.242
What the hell is the matter with you?

38:46.652 --> 38:48.116
No. No!

38:48.319 --> 38:49.385
whoa.

38:49.989 --> 38:51.216
Ricky!

38:52.777 --> 38:56.219
so, what did you walk into, Aaron?

38:57.664 --> 38:59.266
You walked in

38:59.448 --> 39:03.054
on your client shooting
two of his friends.

39:03.890 --> 39:05.655
You had a choice to make.

39:05.807 --> 39:07.552
Your choice was,
you could be a witness

39:07.552 --> 39:11.010
and help us
and lose the family account,

39:11.162 --> 39:13.173
or you could do what you did,

39:13.173 --> 39:15.447
create a little damage control

39:15.447 --> 39:19.000
in which your gun misfired.

39:25.384 --> 39:27.445
You don't have any proof.

39:27.677 --> 39:28.686
Not true.

39:28.686 --> 39:34.433
You're wearing another beautiful
handmade italian suit, Aaron.

39:34.433 --> 39:36.673
I'm sure you've got
a closet full of them.

39:36.673 --> 39:38.482
And we located

39:38.482 --> 39:43.059
a fiber that was lodged between the
trigger and the trigger guard, Aaron.

39:43.059 --> 39:48.215
And the only way that is possible is
if the suit is in close proximity

39:48.215 --> 39:50.939
to a weapon as it's being fired.

39:51.084 --> 39:54.729
It's called "friction transfer. "

39:56.660 --> 39:58.618
You used your sleeve

39:59.969 --> 40:01.876
so you wouldn't leave prints...

40:01.876 --> 40:04.426
And that little fiber

40:04.426 --> 40:07.013
places the murder weapon

40:07.013 --> 40:08.607
in your hand.

40:09.352 --> 40:12.875
In addition, the sample we took from
your car puts you in the bar 45 minutes

40:12.875 --> 40:15.213
after you said you'd left the bar.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.267
How am I doing so far?

40:24.136 --> 40:26.113
Ricky, I can no longer represent you.

40:26.113 --> 40:28.335
You're going to have to find
yourself a new lawyer.

40:28.335 --> 40:29.717
No, no, no,

40:29.717 --> 40:31.549
you're my lawyer.

40:31.549 --> 40:35.217
First, there's the investigation,
then there's the trial.

40:35.217 --> 40:38.394
You think I'm a smart lawyer, you
haven't met my old law professor yet.

40:38.394 --> 40:41.338
But you know what?
You're about to.

40:42.296 --> 40:44.159
I look forward to it.

40:44.789 --> 40:46.272
I'll be ready.

40:47.101 --> 40:48.527
Cuff 'em.

40:59.902 --> 41:01.274
Calleigh.

41:02.345 --> 41:05.012
Hey. I'm not really up for
any conversation right now.

41:05.012 --> 41:06.085
Listen,

41:06.085 --> 41:09.218
I found your dad in a bar
on 14th street.

41:14.737 --> 41:17.005
I'm sorry.
I'll get him in my car.

41:17.480 --> 41:19.281
You didn't need to do this.

41:22.278 --> 41:23.835
Yes, I did.

41:32.222 --> 41:33.725
Hi, lamb chop.

41:33.725 --> 41:35.388
Hi, dad.

41:35.748 --> 41:38.249
A little too much contemplation?

41:39.343 --> 41:42.310
- More than my fair share.
- Let's take you home.

41:53.489 --> 41:55.203
I'm fine now.

41:56.326 --> 41:57.706
In here? / Yep.

41:58.169 --> 41:59.739
There you go.

42:02.508 --> 42:03.664
I'm okay.

42:09.543 --> 42:10.806
Hang on a second.

42:12.365 --> 42:15.068
Son, you really should consider speaking to the prosecutor.

42:15.068 --> 42:16.847
He might be able to cut you a deal.

42:16.922 --> 42:18.599
I've got nothing to deal.

42:20.157 --> 42:21.562
You're not gonna get him.

42:22.423 --> 42:26.211
My family's gonna pay for the best
legal defense you've ever come up against.

42:27.202 --> 42:28.887
And when this is over,

42:28.887 --> 42:30.307
I'm still gonna open my club.

42:30.307 --> 42:31.925
Aaron's still gonna be my lawyer.

42:32.608 --> 42:33.922
You know why?

42:34.372 --> 42:36.512
Because the best defense...

42:36.729 --> 42:38.122
is money.

42:41.287 --> 42:43.069
Ricky,

42:43.150 --> 42:44.882
the best defense

42:44.882 --> 42:47.084
is an honest life.

42:49.906 --> 42:52.026
Take him.
