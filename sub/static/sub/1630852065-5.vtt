00:14.340 --> 00:16.881
Stella. The Pluto was due
back an hour ago.

00:16.965 --> 00:18.631
Where are you? Why aren't you here?

00:18.715 --> 00:21.298
Oh, hey, Loaf. Oh, relax.
Everything's under control--

00:21.381 --> 00:23.131
-[Kira growls]
-Ow! [clears throat]

00:24.965 --> 00:26.465
[Captain Garbage chuckles]

00:28.131 --> 00:30.048
Hey, sorry. But, um...

00:30.673 --> 00:34.215
Is that peanut butter
on both of your eyebrows?

00:34.298 --> 00:36.298
Is everything okay?
Wait, are you not Stella?

00:36.381 --> 00:38.048
Have you been body-snatched?

00:38.131 --> 00:41.381
I could not be better. Loaf, uh...
[clears throat]

00:41.465 --> 00:44.923
Could you tell the Council
that I'll be a tiny bit late? My... um...

00:45.006 --> 00:46.381
My performance review is--

00:46.465 --> 00:47.798
Is this afternoon, I know.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.465
Terrifying to be scrutinized.

00:49.548 --> 00:52.840
What if they find out you secretly
always hated being in outer space?

00:53.173 --> 00:54.756
What? You've always hate...

00:54.840 --> 00:57.215
No, Loaf, I'm not worried about that, I...

00:57.298 --> 01:00.715
-Ow!
-Of course not, because you're you.

01:00.798 --> 01:03.090
You always know how to--

01:03.173 --> 01:04.673
-[growls]
-Oh.

01:04.756 --> 01:06.048
You got little stowaways?

01:06.131 --> 01:09.090
Aw, that one looks like Chonies,
and that one looks like Ed.

01:09.173 --> 01:10.548
Wait, wait, wait, what's going on?

about this planet.

01:58.298 --> 02:02.215
You said that every time
we've landed on a planet.

02:02.298 --> 02:04.506
Yeah, for months.

02:04.590 --> 02:06.548
More times than I can count.

02:06.631 --> 02:08.048
What? No way.

02:08.465 --> 02:10.173
I think this might be the one.

02:10.256 --> 02:11.923
I think this might be the one.

I think this might be the one.

Okay. [sighs]

02:23.298 --> 02:25.298
I know the last few planets
haven't exactly met

02:25.381 --> 02:28.256
the Council's very high standards,

02:28.340 --> 02:29.631
but this time--

02:29.715 --> 02:30.715
[water running]

02:31.715 --> 02:33.131
Water's bugs.

02:33.715 --> 02:34.840

-Out of here.

02:34.923 --> 02:36.340
What's wrong with drinking bugs?

02:36.423 --> 02:38.131
What, do you need a lemon in it?

02:38.215 --> 02:40.715
I did it on my planet,
so why can't humans?

02:40.798 --> 02:43.173
Kira, humans aren't the problem.

02:43.256 --> 02:45.340
In fact... in fact,

02:45.423 --> 02:47.840
I think we can revive our wilting morale

02:47.923 --> 02:50.048
by doing what humans would do.

02:50.131 --> 02:52.840
Colonize this place
and say that we discovered it?

02:52.923 --> 02:54.548
[chuckles] No.

02:54.631 --> 02:57.381
We are taking a day off!

02:57.715 --> 03:00.465
-You're joking.
-Uh, do I sound like I'm joking?

03:00.548 --> 03:02.215
Yeah, pretty much always.

03:02.298 --> 03:04.090
My performance review's tomorrow.

03:04.173 --> 03:06.256
Tomorrow's tomorrow.

03:06.340 --> 03:08.965
That leaves us plenty of time to relax.

03:09.048 --> 03:10.215
Huh.

03:10.298 --> 03:12.590
Can I speak with you for a minute?

03:14.215 --> 03:17.215
Garbage, uh, the review is my chance
to make the Council see

03:17.298 --> 03:19.590
that I'm Captain material. I need to prep.

03:19.715 --> 03:22.881
You've got this, Stella.
If anything, you're too prepared.

03:22.965 --> 03:24.923
Too prepared? Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no.

03:25.006 --> 03:27.090
No, no! In a good way! But look at us.

03:45.715 --> 03:47.006
What? I'm thirsty.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.631

for an exceptional captain:

03:58.715 --> 04:00.715
strategy, insight, focus...

04:00.798 --> 04:02.965
Oh, no, no, it's insight,

04:17.423 --> 04:19.215

Listen to the Council,
stop dropping your blaster!

Protocol for first encounter
with an alien species.

Yes!

05:58.631 --> 06:00.881
One at a time. One at a time!

06:00.965 --> 06:03.340
Okay, so I was the leader.

06:03.423 --> 06:06.881
We're all walking around in the market
eating all the yummy free stuff.

06:06.965 --> 06:08.506
You mean like samples?

06:08.590 --> 06:10.006
Yeah, samples. [giggles]

06:10.090 --> 06:12.173
All of the samples.

06:12.256 --> 06:15.465
We pretended we had money
and wanted to buy things,

06:15.548 --> 06:17.673
but we didn't. [giggles]

06:18.256 --> 06:20.715
Stella! Can you scratch my nose, please?

06:20.798 --> 06:24.881
No, me! My nose is the Captain's nose,
so it's gotta be scratched.

06:24.965 --> 06:26.631
I... You know, I'm not gonna...

06:26.715 --> 06:28.590
Ugh, you know what, just finish the story.

06:28.923 --> 06:32.548
[Nomi] So, so, at the bug water
planet's market, Garbage--

06:32.631 --> 06:34.131
[Ed] When he was still a grown-up.

06:34.215 --> 06:36.256
[Nomi] Yeah, he was still a big boy.

06:36.756 --> 06:38.465
I am the Captain!

06:38.548 --> 06:41.423
[Nomi] Yeah, so, so,
he put a snack in his mouth,

06:41.506 --> 06:43.923
except it was not a snack.

06:44.006 --> 06:45.673
But he didn't chew it.

06:45.756 --> 06:48.090
-[spits]
-[cries]

06:48.173 --> 06:50.965
It tasted like shoe, but alive.

06:51.048 --> 06:54.673
[Ed] And... And then everyone
at the market was so mad at us.

06:54.756 --> 06:57.756
[Nomi] And everyone made faces like,

06:57.840 --> 07:00.298
"Argh, we are mad at you guys!"

07:00.381 --> 07:01.548
Which was us.

07:01.631 --> 07:05.215
Okay, so you were escaping
an angry mob because,

07:05.298 --> 07:08.756
Garbage, you almost ate a baby by mistake?

07:09.131 --> 07:11.173
It tasted like an alive wallet.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.298
Anyway, then we were all so scared,

07:13.381 --> 07:15.048
except for Captain Me!

07:15.131 --> 07:19.048
True. Captain Garbage was...
Was very, very brave.

07:19.131 --> 07:20.756
He bravely said.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.131
[clears throat]

07:22.215 --> 07:25.673
"Let's run away from them right now!"

07:25.965 --> 07:28.381
[all scream]

07:28.465 --> 07:32.381
[Ed] Then, we ran into a weird alien guy.

07:32.465 --> 07:34.715
[Captain Garbage]
I saw the weird alien guy first.

07:34.798 --> 07:37.173
He looked sneaky, so I said...

07:37.256 --> 07:38.756
"Can you help to hide us?"

07:38.840 --> 07:39.965
And he said...

07:40.048 --> 07:42.840
-"Sure, want to turn into babies?"
-So, I said...

07:42.923 --> 07:44.381
"Okay.

07:44.465 --> 07:47.048
Make us babies so we can have a disguise."

07:48.423 --> 07:50.590
[Chonies] And so,
we skipped away from the mob.

07:50.673 --> 07:53.006
Captain Garbage saved the day!

07:53.090 --> 07:54.215
That's right. I did.

07:54.298 --> 07:57.590
[Nomi] Then we did cartwheels
all the way back to the Pluto.

07:57.673 --> 07:59.673
-I'm gonna be sick.
-It's okay, Stella.

07:59.756 --> 08:01.340
Yeah, Chonies was already sick

08:01.423 --> 08:03.298
-over there in the corner.
-Twice!

08:03.381 --> 08:06.548
Okay, it's fine. I can fix this.
All we need to do is--

Where are you? Why aren't you here?

08:38.506 --> 08:40.465
-Oh, hey, Loaf. Oh, relax.

-Pew, pew!

08:50.215 --> 08:53.465

Is that the crew?

-Loaf? Loaf?
-[Loaf groans]

08:56.965 --> 08:58.548
Loaf, get up!

09:01.131 --> 09:04.506
Hi, Loafy. I have peanut butter that
I made in my mouth from chewing peanuts.

09:04.590 --> 09:05.715
See? Aah.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.756
Stella, listen, just...

09:09.840 --> 09:11.548
get back to the M-Bark!

09:11.631 --> 09:13.506
Oh, and tell the Council what?

09:13.590 --> 09:16.673
"Sorry I'm late, my crew turned
into puptots on my watch.

09:16.756 --> 09:20.256
How'd you feel about making me a Captain?
Huh? Never? I agree!"

09:20.923 --> 09:23.381
But what if

09:23.465 --> 09:25.340
you can use the
genetic enhancement machine

09:25.423 --> 09:28.631
to make them grown-ups again
before you meet with the Council.

09:28.715 --> 09:31.090
[inhales] Uh... Oh, that might work,

09:31.173 --> 09:34.006
-but my pilot and my Captain are...
-Arf, arf, arf.

09:34.090 --> 09:36.506
-[Nomi] I'm gonna barf! Barf, barf, barf!
-Dizzy.

09:37.173 --> 09:39.631
Oh, songs about barf make me...

09:39.715 --> 09:41.673
I gotta go. You got this.

10:47.423 --> 10:49.131
Shortcut! Yeah!

10:50.215 --> 10:52.798
Yay! Woo-hoo-hoo!

10:52.881 --> 10:56.465
-Nomi! Ugh. Let me drive now.
-No! I want to!

10:56.548 --> 10:58.215
[gasps] Look!

11:02.381 --> 11:06.006
Nomi, you did a great job,
but now it's Stella's turn.

11:07.965 --> 11:09.215
[snores]

11:24.840 --> 11:26.340
[roars]

11:32.631 --> 11:35.048
[roars]

11:40.048 --> 11:41.465
[all] Yeah!

11:43.548 --> 11:45.340
-Whoa!
-[squeaks]

11:45.423 --> 11:47.215
[cheering, laughing]

11:50.881 --> 11:53.215
Battle stations!

11:53.673 --> 11:55.215
Nope!

11:58.298 --> 11:59.631
I want to go out.

11:59.715 --> 12:01.923
-Stella, as Captain, I command you to--
-[gasps]

12:02.006 --> 12:04.840
No, please sit still.
I'm trying to keep you safe.

12:05.048 --> 12:06.798
-From that!
-[Captain Garbage] No, stop. Stop!

12:08.090 --> 12:10.590
-[cheering, laughing]
-Woo-hoo!

12:12.298 --> 12:14.173
[sighs] Sit tight, puptots.

12:14.256 --> 12:16.465
Time to teach these baddies some manners.

12:17.131 --> 12:19.090
[puppies giggle]

12:26.131 --> 12:27.548
[yelps, gasps]

12:28.715 --> 12:29.756
[alien roaring]

12:47.465 --> 12:49.548
Okay, protocol for first encounter
with an alien species

12:49.631 --> 12:52.381
-is to de-escalate potential conflict.
-[alien shrieking]

12:52.965 --> 12:54.256
Hey, friends.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.923
It's clear that smashing and harvesting
ships for parts is your whole thing,

12:58.006 --> 12:59.923
but I'm just wondering
if you could just, um... [screams]

13:01.340 --> 13:04.465
Whew! Okay, if you want
to play it that way, fine!

13:05.506 --> 13:06.881
[aliens shrieking]

13:13.506 --> 13:16.673
[shrieking]

13:18.131 --> 13:22.340
[strained] I've got an important meeting
and you're making me very late!

13:22.756 --> 13:24.298
[grunts]

13:25.423 --> 13:27.090
[shrieking]

13:28.548 --> 13:30.590
Whoa! [grunts]

13:30.673 --> 13:32.173
[puppies chanting]
Stella and the vultures!

13:32.256 --> 13:33.923
-[gasps]
-Stella and the vultures!

13:34.006 --> 13:35.506
Stella and the vultures!

13:35.590 --> 13:36.590
[phone ringing]

13:36.673 --> 13:38.381
[Loaf] Stella,
Duchess came looking for you.

13:38.465 --> 13:40.215
She's asking why you're not here
for your review.

13:40.298 --> 13:42.215
I didn't want to lie, so I played dead.

13:47.923 --> 13:49.506
Loaf, this is not a good time!

13:49.590 --> 13:51.340
I have an engine to save,
puppies to protect,

13:51.423 --> 13:53.715
and very resourceful
space vultures trying to kill me.

13:53.798 --> 13:56.715
[Loaf] Wow! Space vultures! Oh, no.
My lungs hurt.

13:56.798 --> 13:58.798
Hold on, I'm grabbing my inhaler.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.465
[inhales]

14:01.548 --> 14:04.548
-[cheers, barks]
-[Ed] Yeah!

14:04.840 --> 14:06.923
Why did I ever want to become a Captain?

14:07.840 --> 14:11.048
I'm not cut out for this! I couldn't even
run a daycare, let alone a...

14:11.131 --> 14:12.631
That's it! Daycare!

14:12.715 --> 14:16.298
-[laugh, howl]
-Okay, puppies of the Pluto!

14:16.381 --> 14:19.215
This is our ship and no one
is gonna rip it to pieces.

14:19.298 --> 14:22.256
-Are you ready to save the day?
-Woo-hoo!

14:22.340 --> 14:25.256
-[Ed] Yeah.
-With your big boy Captain.

14:25.840 --> 14:28.173
I am the Captain!

14:28.381 --> 14:30.381
Yay! Woo-hoo!

14:30.465 --> 14:32.923
Yeah, you are! Nomi,

14:33.006 --> 14:36.381
-you get to fly the big space plane.
-Pew, pew, pew!

14:36.465 --> 14:39.840
Chonies, fill the remaining engine
with fire!

14:41.090 --> 14:42.548
Ed, stay out of trouble.

14:42.631 --> 14:45.215
No, no, no, no, wait. Hide from trouble.

14:46.423 --> 14:48.840
I'm the sneakiest boy.

14:48.923 --> 14:50.256
That's right, buddy.

14:50.340 --> 14:52.590
And, Kira, watch out for baddies.

14:53.340 --> 14:54.506
[howls]

14:55.173 --> 14:56.590
[shrieks]

14:56.673 --> 14:58.423
[grunts, groaning]

15:02.506 --> 15:03.506
[sighs]

15:11.881 --> 15:13.840
I'm great at this!

15:15.715 --> 15:16.965
Woo-hoo!

15:19.215 --> 15:22.423
Nomi, make the spaceship go zoom!

15:24.173 --> 15:26.631
-[puppies cheering]
-Woo-hoo-hoo!

15:27.006 --> 15:29.715
Okay, puppies, who wants
to help Stella get back in time

15:29.798 --> 15:31.215
for her performance review?

15:32.840 --> 15:34.840
I... I mean, Nomi,

15:34.923 --> 15:36.798
you want to hit the turbo button now?

15:38.215 --> 15:39.923
[giggles]

15:51.215 --> 15:53.298
[screams]

15:55.090 --> 15:58.590
-Loafy, I'm so excited to see you!
-[puppies] Yeah! Woo-hoo!

15:58.673 --> 16:02.173
Stella, how could something
so cute be so upsetting?

16:02.256 --> 16:03.506
[puppies cheering, giggling]

16:10.881 --> 16:12.881
-I hope this works.
-[laughing]

16:12.965 --> 16:14.631
That wasn't a joke.

16:16.048 --> 16:18.673
I know. I'm laughing
because I missed my review,

16:18.756 --> 16:22.465
[snorts] I wrecked the ship
and probably also my career.

16:22.923 --> 16:25.548
-[continues laughing]
-Oh. Ha-ha?

16:27.840 --> 16:28.965
[cheering]

16:31.256 --> 16:32.340
[Duchess clears throat]

16:32.423 --> 16:33.798
[yelps]

16:33.881 --> 16:35.131
-Stella.
-[gasps]

16:35.215 --> 16:36.840
You missed your review.

16:36.923 --> 16:39.465
-I know. I'm sorry.
-[Loaf clears throat]

16:39.881 --> 16:42.465
Uh, Duchess. It's not her fault. She was--

16:42.548 --> 16:44.548
-Be quiet, Loaf.
-[yelps, swoons]

16:44.631 --> 16:47.048
Come along, Stella.
We'll do the review now.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.423
Oh, uh, okay, sure.

16:53.715 --> 16:56.215
[gasps] I got thumbs now?

16:57.006 --> 16:58.006
Puppies?

16:58.090 --> 17:00.715
Yes, I'm sorry, Duchess.
I should have stayed with my crew.

17:00.798 --> 17:02.840
I wanted so hard to ace
this performance review.

17:02.923 --> 17:05.756
I did my best
and I tried to do the right thing, but...

17:05.840 --> 17:06.965
-I agree.
-Huh?

17:07.048 --> 17:09.965
You did and I'm impressed.

17:10.048 --> 17:12.340
You've shown that
one team member's tenacity

17:12.423 --> 17:14.715
can inspire an entire crew too,

17:14.798 --> 17:16.715
well, grow up.

17:16.798 --> 17:18.381
You're a credit to the M-Bark.

17:18.465 --> 17:21.090
Captaincy isn't far away for you.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.673
[sighs] Thank you so much.

17:22.756 --> 17:25.006
Thank you, thank you. I, um...

17:36.090 --> 17:38.506
A REAL DOGS DINER

17:39.131 --> 17:40.465
-Yes! Stella!
-Yeah. Woo-hoo!

17:40.548 --> 17:42.465
-There she is.
-Woo! Yay, Stella!

17:42.548 --> 17:43.840
-We're rooting for you.
-Yeah!

17:43.923 --> 17:44.923
[laughs]

17:45.006 --> 17:47.298
You guys, I didn't tell you
how it went yet.

17:47.381 --> 17:50.840
You didn't have to.
We saw you in action the whole time.

17:50.923 --> 17:52.048
You were amazing.

17:52.131 --> 17:54.340
Wait, so, you remember everything?

17:54.465 --> 17:57.381
-Oh, yeah.
-All of it.

17:58.131 --> 18:00.965
Yeah. Sorry about all the mess
we made on the ship,

18:01.048 --> 18:03.923
including the mess
you probably haven't discovered yet.

18:04.006 --> 18:05.715
But we made you this.

18:08.881 --> 18:10.798
Aw, thanks, you guys.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.590
It's adorable that you made this
when you were puppies.

18:14.881 --> 18:17.756
Yeah, that's right. When we were puppies.

18:18.756 --> 18:22.423
All hail future Captain Stella!

18:22.506 --> 18:25.423
-[cheering]
-[all chanting] Stella, Stella, Stella!

18:25.506 --> 18:26.715
[Ed] You go, girl!

18:28.756 --> 18:30.756
