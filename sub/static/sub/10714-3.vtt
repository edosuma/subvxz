00:03.702 --> 00:05.803
Mike, your father's coming over now.

00:05.828 --> 00:07.061
This is the perfect time to ask him.

00:07.063 --> 00:09.930
Why do you always want us to connect?

00:09.932 --> 00:13.834
Can I just run out the
clock until he dies?

00:13.836 --> 00:15.536
You and your dad have
been getting closer,

00:15.538 --> 00:17.037
so let's keep that going.

00:17.039 --> 00:18.339
- Here he comes.
- Stop it, stop it, stop it.

00:18.341 --> 00:19.740
He's almost here. Don't be nervous.

00:19.742 --> 00:20.808
- Dad, hey.
- Hi.

00:20.810 --> 00:24.045
It's game night. You wanna be partners?

00:24.047 --> 00:26.380
- Sure, why not?
- Really?

00:26.382 --> 00:30.751
Thanks. I mean, I don't care.

00:30.753 --> 00:32.485
It doesn't matter who
your partner is, Dad.

00:32.488 --> 00:34.221
Stella and I always win.

00:34.223 --> 00:35.222
You know, now that you're adults,

00:35.224 --> 00:37.425
I think you can handle the truth.

00:37.427 --> 00:38.759
We always let you win.

00:38.761 --> 00:39.994
What?

00:39.996 --> 00:41.695
- You let us win?
- Don't be upset.

00:41.697 --> 00:43.531
We were just trying to
bolster your self-esteem.

00:43.533 --> 00:46.600
Not a parent's job.

00:46.602 --> 00:50.004
With all the non-stop praise and
trophies for just showing up

00:50.006 --> 00:53.407
your generation can't handle losing.

00:53.409 --> 00:55.676
I don't want to win
without actually winning.

00:55.678 --> 00:59.547
Stella, we're gonna win tonight,
on our own, fair and square.

00:59.549 --> 01:01.215
Yeah!

01:01.217 --> 01:04.084
If we're losing, let us win.

01:04.087 --> 01:05.953
Are you kidding? We're
going to crush 'em.

01:05.955 --> 01:07.455
Right, partner?

01:07.457 --> 01:09.256
Oh, I forgot the damn ketchup.

01:09.258 --> 01:11.992
I'll get it for you...

01:11.994 --> 01:14.895
partner.

01:14.897 --> 01:16.897
- Bob.
- Hey, Alice.

01:16.899 --> 01:20.000
I have a big surprise for you.

01:20.002 --> 01:22.536
- Ethan!
- Hey, Dad!

01:22.538 --> 01:24.839
Hey!

01:24.841 --> 01:27.675
Everyone, it's Alice's boy, Ethan,

01:27.677 --> 01:28.909
the professional golfer.

01:28.911 --> 01:30.244
Isn't he handsome?

01:30.246 --> 01:32.480
Lock up your daughters. He's single.

01:32.482 --> 01:33.814
- Mom.
- Come here, Ethan.

01:33.816 --> 01:35.049
Say hi to everyone.

01:35.051 --> 01:39.320
Martina? Stella? Oh, so good to see you!

01:39.322 --> 01:43.591
- And who is your lovely friend?
- Ethan, it's me, Shea.

01:43.593 --> 01:45.192
Shea?

01:45.194 --> 01:46.861
Little Shea with the
coke bottle glasses,

01:46.863 --> 01:49.630
acne, and dental headgear?

01:49.632 --> 01:53.200
Yes, puberty was not my friend.

01:53.202 --> 01:56.137
Nor were any actual people.

01:56.139 --> 01:57.671
Well, look at you now.

01:57.673 --> 01:59.840
Not that I'm looking.

01:59.842 --> 02:03.577
I mean, I am, but just
the regular amount.

02:03.579 --> 02:06.080
Hey, how about a round
of drinks on the house

02:06.082 --> 02:07.982
for my wonderful son?

02:07.984 --> 02:11.585
Wow, all I did was get the ketchup, Dad.

02:11.587 --> 02:12.753
Not you!

02:12.755 --> 02:13.854
Ethan!

02:13.856 --> 02:18.325
Hey, Mike. My brother
from another mother!

02:18.327 --> 02:21.195
And father.

02:21.197 --> 02:22.763
So what brings you to Seattle, Ethan?

02:22.765 --> 02:24.999
On my way to the Tokyo Pro-Am.

02:25.001 --> 02:26.066
The sponsors are putting me up

02:26.068 --> 02:27.368
for the night at the Four Seasons.

02:27.370 --> 02:28.469
The Four Seasons, Mike.

02:28.471 --> 02:31.906
That's all the seasons there are.

02:31.908 --> 02:33.174
I remember you when I fitted you

02:33.176 --> 02:34.909
for your first set of clubs.

02:34.911 --> 02:36.644
Only ten years old, and
you could already drive

02:36.646 --> 02:39.013
the ball 200 yards.

02:39.015 --> 02:41.215
I still have those clubs, Dad.

02:41.217 --> 02:44.085
You trying to make me cry?

02:44.087 --> 02:45.853
Well, a celebration is in order.

02:45.855 --> 02:47.621
I think we should move game night.

02:47.623 --> 02:49.056
I love game night.

02:49.058 --> 02:51.258
And me and you, Dad, we're
an unbeatable team.

02:51.260 --> 02:54.428
Perfect! We'll be partners!

02:54.430 --> 02:56.397
No reason not to be.

02:58.266 --> 03:00.000
Here's your stupid ketchup.

03:13.815 --> 03:16.117
My client cancelled so...

03:16.119 --> 03:19.186
Were you gonna eat that sugary cereal?

03:19.188 --> 03:22.490
How did you figure it out, detective?

03:22.492 --> 03:25.192
You specifically asked me
not to buy sugary things,

03:25.194 --> 03:26.727
so you could cut down on sugar.

03:26.729 --> 03:29.530
I only say that because
you get turned on

03:29.532 --> 03:33.701
when I pretend I'm going
to improve myself.

03:33.703 --> 03:36.003
Mike, I know what it's like to
give up something you love.

03:36.005 --> 03:38.806
I gave up smoking, which was
the hardest thing I've done

03:38.808 --> 03:43.878
and I pushed humans out of me.

03:43.880 --> 03:47.381
I hate when you win arguments
using your vagina.

03:47.383 --> 03:48.449
I'll get rid of it.

03:54.623 --> 03:56.690
I feel so alone.

03:58.994 --> 04:01.529
Do you think you're turning to cereal

04:01.531 --> 04:03.564
because when Ethan's
around your dad shows

04:03.566 --> 04:04.899
an obvious preference to him,

04:04.901 --> 04:06.534
and deep down you know
you need to confront him

04:06.536 --> 04:09.236
about the resentment you've
been harboring for 20 years?

04:09.238 --> 04:10.838
No.

04:12.841 --> 04:14.675
So you don't think there's
any sibling rivalry

04:14.677 --> 04:17.344
going on here at all?

04:17.346 --> 04:19.380
No.

04:19.382 --> 04:21.415
I wish my step-brother
would fail at something

04:21.416 --> 04:23.417
so I could be the good son.

04:23.419 --> 04:25.386
Does that make me a terrible person?

04:25.388 --> 04:27.855
Yes, yes, it does.

04:27.857 --> 04:30.624
Sweetie, there's stuff that I do

04:30.626 --> 04:33.160
in my therapy practice that might help.

04:33.162 --> 04:35.963
For example... we could role play,

04:35.965 --> 04:38.733
so I can show you that it's not
gonna be as hard as you think.

04:38.735 --> 04:39.934
And I'm going to do it

04:39.936 --> 04:43.037
just to show you what a
bad idea it would be.

04:45.674 --> 04:49.643
I'll be Bob and you say
what's in your heart.

04:49.645 --> 04:52.847
Okay, Dad...

04:52.849 --> 04:55.750
I loved having sex
with you this morning.

05:00.555 --> 05:01.722
Take it seriously.

05:01.724 --> 05:05.960
I can't. You know why? It's dumb.

05:05.962 --> 05:08.796
There's no wrong way to do this.

05:11.333 --> 05:15.236
Dad... you've always preferred Ethan,

05:15.238 --> 05:18.239
and you're a mean son of
a bitch with devil eyes.

05:19.474 --> 05:21.308
Why won't you take this seriously?

05:21.310 --> 05:22.543
Because, well, are we sure

05:22.545 --> 05:25.513
that therapy does anything?

05:28.450 --> 05:29.517
Say what now?

05:29.519 --> 05:31.118
Now you're upset. This is what happens

05:31.120 --> 05:34.088
when you express your feelings.

05:34.090 --> 05:37.391
Wow, you know what? I need some air.

05:37.393 --> 05:38.426
Shows what you know.

05:38.428 --> 05:41.028
Everyone needs air!

05:43.598 --> 05:45.633
Good one, Mike.

05:47.369 --> 05:49.070
I can't believe they let us win.

05:49.072 --> 05:51.238
I guess they wanted us to
feel good about ourselves.

05:51.240 --> 05:55.009
I mean, who do they think
they are, alcohol?

05:55.011 --> 05:56.177
If we're going to win fair and square,

05:56.179 --> 05:58.212
we need to work our
butts off practicing.

05:58.214 --> 06:00.147
That sounds awful, but...

06:00.149 --> 06:02.450
Okay, I'll get the weed.

06:02.452 --> 06:03.818
We can't practice high.

06:03.820 --> 06:04.919
Why not?

06:04.921 --> 06:06.921
As long as we also play the game high,

06:06.923 --> 06:08.489
we're golden.

06:08.491 --> 06:12.193
You should really know
that as a scientist.

[coughing]

06:28.143 --> 06:30.244
Ethan?

06:30.246 --> 06:32.413
Welcome to the Four Seasons?

06:35.941 --> 06:38.810
Please don't tell anyone,
especially my dad and...

06:38.812 --> 06:41.879
Mom! So good to see you!

06:41.935 --> 06:44.659
Ethan Alexander Ellis,

06:44.684 --> 06:46.817
what the hell are you
doing in this shed?

06:46.819 --> 06:48.919
What are you doing in this shed?

06:48.921 --> 06:51.355
A mother always knows
where her son is...

06:51.357 --> 06:55.125
when she's got a tracking
app on her phone.

06:55.127 --> 06:57.595
Look, Mom, I actually came home

06:57.597 --> 06:58.963
to tell you and Dad something,

06:58.965 --> 07:01.132
but Dad made such a fuss
about how proud he is of me

07:01.134 --> 07:02.767
that I chickened out.

07:02.769 --> 07:05.202
You see, I have this thing...

07:05.204 --> 07:06.170
A thing?

07:06.172 --> 07:09.139
Oh, my God! My baby's dying.

07:09.141 --> 07:12.109
I'm not dying, Mom.

07:12.111 --> 07:13.944
My hands shake when I putt.

07:13.946 --> 07:16.180
It's called the yips.

07:16.182 --> 07:17.381
My golf career is over.

07:17.383 --> 07:19.650
- Aw, honey.
- Aw.

07:19.652 --> 07:20.751
There go my dreams of being

07:20.753 --> 07:23.354
the completely black Tiger Woods.

07:24.556 --> 07:26.457
They're not even sure what causes it.

07:26.459 --> 07:28.058
It could just be psychological.

07:28.060 --> 07:31.362
Oh, my God! My boy's crazy!

07:31.364 --> 07:33.964
But none of this explains
why you are in a shed.

07:33.966 --> 07:35.032
You've got money.

07:35.034 --> 07:36.834
I had money.

07:36.836 --> 07:40.204
I also had the idea I could
play high-stakes poker.

07:40.206 --> 07:44.441
So you're crazy, broke,
and you're not a golfer.

07:44.443 --> 07:46.744
Your father's a dead man.

07:46.746 --> 07:48.179
Okay, here's what we'll do.

07:48.181 --> 07:50.881
I'll talk to him. I
know how to handle him.

07:50.883 --> 07:54.151
Or...

07:54.153 --> 07:58.355
are we missing an opportunity
for some real growth?

07:58.357 --> 07:59.890
Martina is right.

07:59.892 --> 08:01.392
I should tell Dad.

08:01.394 --> 08:02.526
I'll do it at game night.

08:02.528 --> 08:03.928
There'll be a nice family vibe,

08:03.930 --> 08:04.929
he'll have a few drinks in him...

08:04.931 --> 08:06.630
All right, all right, but if you feel

08:06.632 --> 08:08.999
like you're going to cry,
you just look over to me

08:09.001 --> 08:11.569
and I will step in and fix everything.

08:11.571 --> 08:12.803
You know, Alice,

08:12.805 --> 08:15.539
this might be an opportunity
for growth for you too.

08:15.541 --> 08:19.376
Aw, all that therapy mumbo
jumbo is for white people.

08:23.181 --> 08:24.782
So tonight's game is Celebrity.

08:24.784 --> 08:26.250
I wrote this one.

08:26.252 --> 08:27.718
She was the first white woman

08:27.720 --> 08:30.321
on "The Real Housewives of Atlanta."

08:30.323 --> 08:31.956
No idea.

08:31.958 --> 08:33.457
Kim Zolciak?

08:33.458 --> 08:36.693
The Jackie Robinson of that show?

08:36.696 --> 08:38.429
She broke the color barrier.

08:38.431 --> 08:40.798
Everybody knows that.

08:40.799 --> 08:44.268
Nobody knows yours. Neil deGrasse Tyson?

08:44.270 --> 08:46.470
He's a hugely popular astrophysicist.

08:46.472 --> 08:48.005
Whatever.

08:48.007 --> 08:50.374
I don't get your whole space thing.

08:50.376 --> 08:52.009
Thinking about how big the universe is

08:52.011 --> 08:56.280
makes me feel like I'm non-significant.

08:56.282 --> 08:57.815
Well, that's what I love.

08:57.817 --> 09:01.819
It makes everything seem
small, even my problems.

09:01.821 --> 09:03.654
Yeah, that's how I feel

09:03.656 --> 09:07.892
when someone famous looks
like crap in their sex tape.

09:07.894 --> 09:10.928
I mean, that's the day you
don't get your roots done?

09:12.597 --> 09:14.532
We're looking at the top of your head!

09:16.868 --> 09:20.171
- Mike.
- Honey...

09:20.173 --> 09:23.073
Sorry for crapping on therapy.

09:23.075 --> 09:25.109
It's probably real.

09:28.146 --> 09:30.815
I'm gonna be an adult and I'm
gonna talk to Dad about Ethan.

09:30.817 --> 09:33.884
Oh, that's such a good idea!

09:33.886 --> 09:36.587
Oh, I'm so proud of you!

09:36.589 --> 09:38.589
But don't do it.

09:40.158 --> 09:41.625
But you said I should do it.

09:41.627 --> 09:42.993
I did say you should do it.

09:42.995 --> 09:44.128
So I should do it.

09:44.130 --> 09:45.696
No, you definitely shouldn't do it.

09:48.233 --> 09:51.135
You know how you needed air before?

09:51.137 --> 09:52.470
Now I need air.

09:52.472 --> 09:54.038
Are you happy?

09:54.040 --> 09:56.707
You made me need air!

10:11.923 --> 10:13.624
You're not going to believe this.

10:13.626 --> 10:14.725
Ethan is living in the shed

10:14.727 --> 10:16.827
and he blew all of his money gambling.

10:16.829 --> 10:19.563
What?

10:21.533 --> 10:22.566
You knew?

10:22.568 --> 10:25.803
I bumped into him in there.

10:27.205 --> 10:28.472
- Does Dad know?
- No.

10:28.474 --> 10:29.640
And you can't tell him.

10:29.642 --> 10:32.176
Ethan is going to tell
everyone at game night.

10:32.178 --> 10:35.813
[laughs]

10:35.815 --> 10:38.082
It's gonna crush my father.

10:39.284 --> 10:41.285
It's too bad.

So that was your first kiss?

10:47.360 --> 10:48.208
Yes.

10:48.372 --> 10:50.405
I never told anyone that story,

10:50.407 --> 10:54.376
even our coworkers at
the Renaissance Faire.

10:54.378 --> 10:58.380
He may have only been a jester,
but he was my knight that day.

10:59.582 --> 11:01.183
<i>Girls, game's starting!</i>

11:01.185 --> 11:03.385
Oh, no! We didn't practice!

11:03.387 --> 11:04.586
We did the exact thing everyone accuses

11:04.588 --> 11:06.021
our generation of.

11:06.023 --> 11:09.057
We agreed we deserve to win,
but we didn't do the work.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.926
We just spent all that time
getting to know each other.

11:10.928 --> 11:13.462
Now don't you wish we'd gotten high?

11:14.397 --> 11:16.899
Okay. I'm the time-keeper,

11:16.901 --> 11:20.535
but I'm also here to help
anyone who needs help.

11:24.073 --> 11:26.875
The names are right there.
Are we ready to play?

11:26.877 --> 11:29.077
Let's just go first
and get it over with.

11:29.079 --> 11:31.813
Ready? And... go!

11:31.815 --> 11:34.249
Ooh! You had your first
sexy dream about him.

11:34.251 --> 11:35.250
Benedict Cumberbatch!

11:35.252 --> 11:37.586
Don't get it, but yes!

11:37.588 --> 11:39.154
Oh, that black guy that you like.

11:39.156 --> 11:41.189
What now?

11:41.191 --> 11:43.592
- Neil deGrasse Tyson!
- Yes!

11:43.594 --> 11:45.561
Oh, I got into a fight
about her at the DMV

11:45.563 --> 11:46.929
and that's why I don't
have a driver's license.

11:46.931 --> 11:50.065
- Miley Cyrus!
- Yes!

11:50.067 --> 11:52.601
You don't have a driver's license?

11:52.603 --> 11:53.569
- [bell dings]
- Oh, my God!

11:53.571 --> 11:55.037
We're awesome!

11:55.039 --> 11:56.138
Okay.

11:56.140 --> 12:00.008
Mike and Martina, you're up.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.009
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.278
And... go!

12:03.280 --> 12:05.080
Easy! You said I look like her.

12:05.082 --> 12:06.315
Uh... Lucille Ball.

12:06.317 --> 12:08.016
What?

12:08.018 --> 12:09.184
She looks crazy.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.652
I couldn't think of another redhead.

12:10.654 --> 12:11.653
Uh... Nicole Kidman.

12:11.655 --> 12:13.689
No, the girl from "Zero Dark Thirty"!

12:13.691 --> 12:14.723
Isn't that Nicole Kidman?

12:14.725 --> 12:16.658
[bell dings]

12:16.660 --> 12:17.993
It was Jessica Chastain!

12:17.995 --> 12:19.027
How could I say you look like her?

12:19.029 --> 12:21.263
I don't know who that is.

12:21.265 --> 12:25.634
Oh, now I remember. I
said I look like her,

12:25.636 --> 12:28.170
and you said, "I don't
know who that is."

12:28.172 --> 12:30.439
So the current score is 3 to 0.

12:30.441 --> 12:32.140
Seems like you're unable to
win because you don't have

12:32.142 --> 12:35.978
the requisite skills
to excel at the game.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.281
We need to work on your trash talk.

12:40.550 --> 12:43.418
Choking under pressure, huh?

12:43.420 --> 12:46.755
This is exactly why Mike
never made it as a golfer.

12:46.757 --> 12:48.624
But at least I got one.

12:48.626 --> 12:50.926
That big dummy's got a surprise coming.

12:52.595 --> 12:54.796
Okay, Bob and Ethan, you're up.

12:54.798 --> 12:56.198
And, Ethan, remember,

12:56.200 --> 12:59.835
if you need any help, I'm right here.

12:59.837 --> 13:03.038
He knows where you are, Alice.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.973
And... go!

13:04.975 --> 13:07.409
I like one of his movies,
but hate the other one.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.443
Kevin Costner.

13:08.445 --> 13:10.612
Yes!

13:10.614 --> 13:12.915
You know me so well, son.

13:14.550 --> 13:17.052
That guy with the thing and
they go into the thing.

13:17.054 --> 13:18.153
"Ocean's Eleven"!

13:18.155 --> 13:20.222
Yes!

13:20.224 --> 13:23.192
But the actor, the one with
the face I want to punch.

13:23.194 --> 13:24.927
There's so many!

13:24.929 --> 13:26.161
Narrow it down! Narrow it down!

13:26.163 --> 13:28.030
Clooney! Damon! Pitt!

13:28.032 --> 13:29.464
- [bell dings]
- Oh, to be fair,

13:29.466 --> 13:32.167
I would have punched all those guys.

13:32.169 --> 13:33.969
But it was Casey Affleck.

13:36.873 --> 13:38.941
Mike, remember when Ethan
introduced me to Costner

13:38.943 --> 13:40.776
at that celeb tourney?

13:40.778 --> 13:43.779
Terrific grip on his handshake
for a gay movie star.

13:46.482 --> 13:47.783
Kevin Costner is not gay.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.385
Oh, please, he's an actor.
They're all gay.

13:52.255 --> 13:54.756
And before you girls
jump down my throat,

13:54.758 --> 13:56.959
I'm fine with it. I shook
his hand, didn't I?

13:58.962 --> 14:00.229
Hey, Ethan, you got any more

14:00.231 --> 14:02.264
of those celebrity tourneys coming up?

14:07.804 --> 14:10.973
I'm right here, baby.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.475
Why does Grandma keep
saying where she is?

14:14.644 --> 14:18.280
Well, I do have something
to tell you, Dad.

14:18.282 --> 14:20.616
He does.

14:20.618 --> 14:22.718
And it's that...

14:24.954 --> 14:27.789
At the Tokyo Pro-Am, I'm going
to play with Bill Murray.

14:29.626 --> 14:30.826
He's my favorite!

14:30.828 --> 14:33.228
I know and I'd love to
introduce you to him!

14:33.230 --> 14:35.697
Is this guy a hell of a son or what?

14:36.966 --> 14:38.467
Hey, Ethan, why don't
you call Bill Murray

14:38.469 --> 14:41.403
from your suite at the Four Seasons?

14:45.575 --> 14:48.210
It probably makes this
place look like a shed.

14:52.115 --> 14:53.282
Martina...

14:53.284 --> 14:54.883
Guys... kitchen.

14:54.885 --> 14:55.984
Okay.

14:55.986 --> 14:57.886
You have to tell your dad the truth now.

14:57.888 --> 14:59.488
And you two have to shut up and let him.

14:59.490 --> 15:02.257
I know you all think that
therapy's not effective...

15:02.259 --> 15:04.560
- That's not what I said.
- It's what I said.

15:06.930 --> 15:08.864
Look, Ethan.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.366
In therapy we say it's
best to avoid words

15:11.368 --> 15:13.135
like "always" and "never."

15:13.137 --> 15:15.270
Express what you're feeling
with "I" statements

15:15.272 --> 15:17.372
and come from a place of love.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.508
Got it?

15:19.510 --> 15:21.043
Got it.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.644
The living room's this way.

15:26.516 --> 15:27.950
- Bob?
- Hmm?

15:27.952 --> 15:31.386
Ethan has something to say to you.

15:31.388 --> 15:34.056
Well, for starters,

15:34.058 --> 15:35.657
you're not gonna get
to meet Bill Murray.

15:35.659 --> 15:37.392
What?

15:40.663 --> 15:44.333
You don't get to meet Bill Murray.

15:47.403 --> 15:49.504
I'm sorry.

15:50.506 --> 15:51.807
Go on, Ethan.

15:54.544 --> 15:58.680
The truth is...

15:58.682 --> 16:00.349
Bill pulled out of the Tokyo Pro-Am,

16:00.351 --> 16:02.084
but maybe you can meet
him at the Phoenix.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.518
I'll give him a call.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.654
Well, this is ridiculous.
He's never gonna tell him!

16:05.656 --> 16:06.622
Tell me what?

16:06.624 --> 16:08.123
- I'll do it, baby.
- No!

16:08.125 --> 16:09.925
Ethan is going to do it
himself in a healthy,

16:09.927 --> 16:14.096
- therapeutic manner.
- Oh, good lord!

16:15.798 --> 16:18.133
I'm with her.

16:18.135 --> 16:20.602
Enough with this therapy baloney!

16:20.604 --> 16:22.471
That's it! I can't take it anymore!

16:22.473 --> 16:24.273
Therapy is not baloney!

16:24.275 --> 16:27.409
It's real and I do it for a living.

16:27.411 --> 16:29.978
And thank God I do, 'cause otherwise,

16:29.980 --> 16:31.780
we'd be in a world where
people just blurt out

16:31.782 --> 16:35.117
that Ethan's golf career is over
and he's living in our shed!

16:45.528 --> 16:49.531
Now that was healthy and therapeutic.

16:54.604 --> 16:56.805
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Dad.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.274
The last thing I'd ever want
to do is disappoint you.

17:00.169 --> 17:01.202
I was embarrassed.

17:01.204 --> 17:04.038
I'm embarrassed too for my outburst.

17:07.742 --> 17:11.846
But this isn't about me, so
I'll just be right here.

17:11.848 --> 17:14.114
Unfortunately... this means I'll need

17:14.116 --> 17:16.183
to stay with you until
I get back on my feet.

17:16.185 --> 17:18.085
I guess we got something in common, Dad.

17:18.087 --> 17:21.088
We both got kids who are
disappointments living at home.

17:21.089 --> 17:23.824
- both: Hey!
- Hey!

17:23.826 --> 17:25.159
Disappointment?

17:25.161 --> 17:27.928
This man is not a disappointment!

17:27.930 --> 17:30.231
It took a lot of guts for
him to tell me the truth,

17:30.233 --> 17:32.066
the guts of a champion.

17:32.068 --> 17:33.934
A champion who needs
a hug, I'm guessing.

17:37.105 --> 17:39.673
Seriously?

17:45.780 --> 17:47.314
What are you doing here?

17:47.316 --> 17:51.018
Ethan told me you come out
here to eat children's cereal.

17:52.420 --> 17:55.756
Yes, alone.

17:55.758 --> 17:57.691
What the hell's the matter with you?

17:57.693 --> 17:59.960
Whenever Ethan's around, you
always get bent out of shape.

17:59.962 --> 18:01.428
What's your problem with him?

18:01.430 --> 18:04.331
It's not Ethan; it's you!
You're the problem!

18:04.333 --> 18:08.702
You never once give me...

18:08.704 --> 18:11.672
You always treat him...

18:11.674 --> 18:14.041
What? Why do you stop?

18:14.043 --> 18:17.278
It's best to avoid words
like "always" and "never."

18:17.280 --> 18:18.546
Why?

18:18.548 --> 18:21.382
I don't know. It's something I heard.

18:21.384 --> 18:25.419
Look, Dad, I feel like
you prefer Ethan to me.

18:26.621 --> 18:29.089
And it hurts...

18:29.091 --> 18:32.960
the feelings...

18:32.962 --> 18:34.195
of me.

18:36.598 --> 18:37.731
Ah, screw it.

18:37.733 --> 18:39.099
Just get out of here

18:39.101 --> 18:42.102
and let me eat my cereal.

18:42.104 --> 18:43.137
Suit yourself.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.443
Look.

18:49.445 --> 18:53.113
When you were born, I
was in a bad marriage.

18:53.115 --> 18:55.516
And maybe I associate you with that.

18:55.518 --> 18:58.185
But then I met Alice, and
I was in a happy marriage

18:58.187 --> 19:02.890
with this little boy
who really needed me.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.526
It probably won't make
you feel any better,

19:05.528 --> 19:06.827
but the mistakes I made with you

19:06.829 --> 19:09.129
made me a better father to Ethan.

19:09.131 --> 19:12.233
You are a good father.

19:12.235 --> 19:13.934
To him.

19:15.771 --> 19:19.807
Plus Ethan, he looks up to me.

19:19.809 --> 19:22.176
He worships the ground I walk on.

19:22.178 --> 19:23.644
Do you feel that way about me?

19:23.646 --> 19:29.183
I'd have to be delusional
to feel that way about you.

19:29.185 --> 19:31.619
You are a pain in the ass, Mike.

19:31.621 --> 19:33.821
You are a son of a bitch, dad.

19:33.823 --> 19:38.325
Look at us getting all mushy.

19:38.327 --> 19:39.326
What you got there?

19:39.328 --> 19:40.528
Eh, Captain Crunch.

19:40.530 --> 19:43.664
With Crunchberries? It's good stuff.

19:43.666 --> 19:44.832
You know, when you were a kid

19:44.834 --> 19:46.233
I used to take all the marshmallows

19:46.235 --> 19:47.802
out of the Lucky Charms.

19:47.804 --> 19:50.604
Lucky Charms has marshmallows?

19:53.608 --> 19:55.176
Good night, Mike.

19:55.178 --> 19:57.978
You can come out now, Martina.

20:01.483 --> 20:02.917
I may have been a bad dad,

20:02.919 --> 20:05.553
but I'm still a hell of a detective.

20:08.890 --> 20:12.827
Lucy, you got some 'splaining to do.

20:12.829 --> 20:17.565
So do you, secret sugar cereal eater.

20:17.567 --> 20:18.866
Yours is way worse than mine.

20:18.868 --> 20:21.035
Cigarettes were never part
of a balanced breakfast.

20:21.037 --> 20:23.804
They were in the trailer
park I grew up in.

20:26.208 --> 20:29.746
That was a great talk that you two had.

20:30.575 --> 20:33.708
And whoever gave you that
"always" and "never" advice,

20:33.733 --> 20:35.521
sounds like a beautiful genius.

20:37.473 --> 20:39.692
I apologize for ever doubting it.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.614
Taste like cigarettes.

20:45.739 --> 20:47.692
You taste like Crunchberries.

20:49.867 --> 20:51.180
Lucky you.
