enjoyed more than stories

00:04.700 --> 00:06.160

enjoyed less

to Puerto Rico?

00:23.470 --> 00:24.710

the village she grew up in

childhood in the memoir.

down there.

three pairs of socks per day.

You said eating raw fish
makes you feel like a pelican.

00:55.740 --> 00:57.480

isn't raw fish.

It's 2021.
Who even uses cash anymore?

16:55.040 --> 16:57.460
- I always tell you
to carry some just in case.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.560

17:00.440 --> 17:02.350
Second, it makes it harder

I just want to say,

17:56.370 --> 17:58.670
we're sorry about
all the weirdness earlier.

17:58.770 --> 18:02.150
We were just being silly
and feeling a little jealous

18:02.250 --> 18:04.610
because Uncle Connor knew
about Cayden and we didn't.

18:05.580 --> 18:08.680
- You told them about Cayden?
You broke the code.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.880

It just slipped out.

18:29.110 --> 18:30.730
- I didn't wanna talk
to you about stuff

18:30.830 --> 18:32.660
because you're my parents.

We're just cringe.
We're cringe.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.110
- Like all the other parents,
we're cringe.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.470
both: We're cringe,
we're cringe, we're cringe.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.600

the same thing.

19:07.700 --> 19:10.330
- Well, you're lucky to have
such a cool uncle.

19:10.430 --> 19:12.770
- He also said I have
to step up my sneaker game

19:12.870 --> 19:14.650
since boys love cool kicks.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.690
So he's buying me
a pair of Pump Omnis.

Okay, whoa.

it was gonna hurt this much.

I--I can't look.
Is he almost done?

the R of "Marina."

19:31.040 --> 19:32.900

19:33.000 --> 19:34.780

the rest?

19:34.880 --> 19:38.990
- No, you're worth it.
You are so worth it.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.230
And just--why is there
so much blood?

19:41.330 --> 19:43.030

19:43.130 --> 19:45.190
Listen, I know tonight
didn't go as you planned,

19:45.290 --> 19:46.750

19:46.850 --> 19:48.270
that you put in
the effort, okay?

19:48.370 --> 19:50.280
And this is
a really nice surprise.

19:50.380 --> 19:54.240
- Look, I promise to be more
into trying new things.

19:54.340 --> 19:56.520
And I know I'm not
the sexiest guy in the world.

19:56.620 --> 19:59.320

who I married, okay?

19:59.420 --> 20:00.880
I love Tomás,

20:00.980 --> 20:03.090

seeing him again,

to go home with Tom.

20:10.390 --> 20:12.890
In fact, I've changed my mind.

20:12.990 --> 20:15.100
I want to get "Tom"
instead of "Tomás."

20:15.200 --> 20:17.500
- Because she loves me
just as I am.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.600
- Absolutely.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.740
And it's two letters shorter.
That looks very painful.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.820

20:24.920 --> 20:26.740
Oh, here's the bone.
He's at the bone!
