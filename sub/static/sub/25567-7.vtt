-Dad, she said you were dead!
-Didn't we talk on the phone yesterday?

01:37.096 --> 01:39.307
It's been such a long time,
I miss you already.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.393
Look, I explained this already,
Daddy and Mommy aren't--

What a drag, this conversation again?
I can't take it anymore!

01:48.316 --> 01:49.901

-[Alfonso] What did she do wrong?
-She was so sweet.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.523
She was eating toilet paper
like cotton candy. Poor thing, this isn't for everyone.

06:02.528 --> 06:07.742
[Liliane] <i>It's me! I am the fourth</i>
<i>Plimplom! And I want my place back!</i>

It's been how many years?

06:11.871 --> 06:15.291
-Go seek some treatment!
<i>-</i> [Liliane] <i>I've done therapy for 30 years.</i>

06:15.374 --> 06:19.212
[Liliane] <i>And I learned to accept things.</i>
<i>Weak people need to be replaced indeed.</i>

06:19.295 --> 06:21.798
OK, honey! Why don't we
talk some other time?

06:21.881 --> 06:25.426
<i>-Let's go on with the show--</i>
<i>-And my tiara? Did you keep it for me?</i>

06:31.015 --> 06:33.059
Put that back in the chest, now.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.192
Find this woman, see what she wants,
give her some money! End this!

06:41.275 --> 06:44.195
Fine. Calm down.
Everything is already underway.

06:44.278 --> 06:47.073
Thanks for cutting to the commercials.
It was a disaster.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.033
Disaster? That call was the best!

06:49.117 --> 06:51.828
We're number two,
we just couldn't beat the soap opera! -This isn't what I wanted, Marcinho!
-It's even better!

06:54.705 --> 06:57.667
The show you were going to do
would have a whipped cream pool,

06:57.750 --> 07:00.503
an old-lady makeover,
desserts, weather forecast--

07:00.586 --> 07:02.630
We were going to do something relevant!

07:02.713 --> 07:06.134
Relevant is sex, scandal,
product placement.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.554
In the 80s, who do you think
paid for your show? Berenice Ketchup!

07:09.637 --> 07:12.765
If you don't want content,
you're working for the wrong person!

07:12.849 --> 07:15.476
Now, do what I asked
and I'll go to my pie game segment!

07:15.560 --> 07:18.688

Do you know who you're talking to?

07:18.771 --> 07:20.064
FOURTH PLIMPLOM RETURNS!

07:20.148 --> 07:22.692
[Brandon] How come no one mentioned
this Mushroom Girl?

07:24.444 --> 07:27.405
Brandon, to be remembered,
you have to leave your mark.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.906
Look at the Plimploms story!

07:33.369 --> 07:35.455
What is the biggest problem in the world?

07:36.622 --> 07:40.543
-The return of the fourth Plimplom?
-No, Brandon! It's the extinction of bees.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.754
I've told you! The bees are disappearing! Phew. You know I'm allergic.

07:46.424 --> 07:50.303
I know, but if the bees are gone,
life on Earth ends.

07:50.803 --> 07:51.804

I came to wish you good luck.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.522

08:22.251 --> 08:26.923

-Then sign this, the divorce papers.

08:46.984 --> 08:48.486
[Samantha] Do I sign here?

08:53.449 --> 08:55.076
I don't need you, Dodoi.

Well, guys, let's go to the next segment.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.846
I don't think you want
to expose intimate details.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.766
Yes, I do! That's why I came here!

10:42.933 --> 10:44.602
When I left the Plimploms,

10:44.685 --> 10:49.065
I was a bit disoriented.
But then I had some time to reflect.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.151
And it's very common for those who work
in this kind of thing

10:52.234 --> 10:54.945
to have deep psychological traumas.
Right, Samantha?

10:55.029 --> 10:56.322
No, not me.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.615
[crowd] Oh!

10:57.698 --> 10:58.866
[Liliane] Focus on me.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.369
Anyway, problems aren't interesting.

11:01.452 --> 11:04.622
All of a sudden, I was back here
and I'm great!

11:04.705 --> 11:05.873
Just look at my hair.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.877
I am happy! I've attempted suicide,
I've never sunbathed.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.088
And for all this I have to thank...

-Hi!
-Laila?

11:50.251 --> 11:53.337
I really have to pee.
You can stay, it's only pee.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.090
-[Dodoi] What's this?
-I came straight from work.

11:56.173 --> 12:00.094
-I'll leave you alone.
-Big party? Samantha must be proud.

12:00.177 --> 12:02.096
We're not together anymore.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.392
-I'd better give you some privacy.
-[Laila] Don't worry, it's your party!

12:06.475 --> 12:09.437
Juninho says you're like a brother
to him. We're home, baby.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.105
Are you hooking up with Juninho?

12:11.188 --> 12:14.942
He told me that you grew up together,
he was there the day you were arrested.

12:15.025 --> 12:18.696
-But does he know we--
-Of course not, he's super jealous!

12:18.779 --> 12:22.658
It would be a mess if he found out,
if he caught us locked up in the bathroom.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.577
[knocking on door]

12:24.660 --> 12:28.164
[Juninho] <i>Dodoi? Where are you, candy-ass?</i>
<i>The game isn't over yet!</i>

12:28.247 --> 12:30.583
[Juninho] <i>I want to introduce you</i>
<i>to my girl, man.</i>

12:32.543 --> 12:36.046
-This warrior here has thick skin!
-Not at all!

12:36.130 --> 12:40.593
-This woman kicks ass! At ten years old--
-Nine!

12:40.676 --> 12:43.471
At nine years old,
she toured all over Brazil,

12:43.554 --> 12:45.681
performed eight times a week,

12:45.764 --> 12:48.434
no sleep, no playing, no studying.

12:48.517 --> 12:51.228
And all that sacrifice
was while singing a song

12:51.312 --> 12:53.189
that has someone else's voice.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.901
-What?
-[Liliane] Impeccable.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.487
[Liliane] She'd get nothing wrong,
not a verse.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.907
Nobody realized that the one
singing the Plimploms song was me!

13:02.990 --> 13:04.950
-[crowd] Whoa!
-What are you talking about?

13:05.409 --> 13:08.412
My darling, are you sure
you were discharged from hospital?

13:08.496 --> 13:09.705
It doesn't look like it.

13:09.788 --> 13:13.751
I'm being all polite with you,
and you came for what? To lie on my show?

13:13.834 --> 13:15.461
[condescending] Aww!

13:15.544 --> 13:18.881
Poor girl! Nobody told her. No problem.

13:18.964 --> 13:23.636
We've begun a new era of the Plimploms.
No more secrets.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.013
-OK, I'm a virgin!
-[both women] Tico, please!

13:27.139 --> 13:29.350
Samantha, Brazil...

13:30.142 --> 13:33.896
the voice in the Plimploms song is mine!

13:34.271 --> 13:36.190
[crowd cheers]

13:36.273 --> 13:38.692
I brought a little souvenir here
to prove it!

13:39.193 --> 13:40.861
Marcinho, what the hell is this?

13:43.030 --> 13:43.948
[knocking]

13:44.031 --> 13:46.867
[Juninho] <i>Dodoi, everyone saw you</i>
<i>going in there! Come out!</i>

13:46.951 --> 13:49.078
Just a minute! I'm coming!

13:49.161 --> 13:52.623
-What do we do? Juninho will think--
-That we had wild sex on the sink?

13:53.624 --> 13:56.544
[Juninho] <i>Whoever loses has to drink</i>
<i>the whole bottle. Come out!</i>

13:56.627 --> 13:57.670
I should open the door

13:57.753 --> 14:00.631
after everything you've done.
You weren't very kind to me.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.551
[Dodoi] Laila, don't do this! Laila.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.677
Hey--

14:07.721 --> 14:13.686
[singing badly]
♪ <i>Telepathically here's what he said </i>♪

14:14.311 --> 14:19.650
[singing badly] ♪ <i>We are all of this </i>♪

14:20.442 --> 14:24.613
[singing badly]
♪ <i>It's time to know we're not-- </i>♪

14:27.449 --> 14:30.286
[Liliane] Was that clear that I sang
the entire song by myself?

14:30.369 --> 14:31.954
[Marcinho] Yeah, it's clear...

14:32.746 --> 14:36.000
This is a historical moment!
Stay on her. Stay on her!

14:36.083 --> 14:37.543
[Liliane] Cute, right?

14:37.918 --> 14:41.672
The voice in Mom's music
isn't really Mom's voice?

14:42.089 --> 14:43.883
I'm in shock.

14:44.300 --> 14:48.262
-Does that mean I'm not Mom's son?
-How much coffee did you drink today?

14:49.054 --> 14:51.515
What else is still hidden in here?

14:54.018 --> 14:57.521
-[Brandon] Do you know how to use it?
-[Cindy] I saw it on the internet. [Cindy] Playing it backwards
may reveal a satanic message.

15:01.483 --> 15:02.693
[slow, strange voice]

15:02.776 --> 15:06.405
[record, vaguely] <i>Eat Berenice Ketchup!</i>

15:06.488 --> 15:09.950
[Liliane] Wow! I can tell
you do Cross-Fit!

15:10.034 --> 15:13.287
-[Tico] I'm glad you noticed.
-[Liliane] I lifted tires at the clinic.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.497
-How cool--
-[Samantha] Excuse me, sweetheart.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.042
-Who should I kill?
-Who should you thank, right?

15:18.125 --> 15:22.129
Because we beat the soap opera!
I've achieved the impossible!

15:22.212 --> 15:25.507
What do you mean, you achieved it?
You planned this bullshit?

15:25.591 --> 15:27.760
Getting us to first place
on prime time? Yes.

15:27.843 --> 15:31.388
-Marcinho, this song was my life!
-No. Now this show is yours!

15:32.056 --> 15:33.515
This show is no one's anymore.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.768
Do you know how hard it was
to find this woman?

15:35.851 --> 15:37.978
Lucky I already had a record
in that clinic.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.816
This is one episode, angel.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.360
Finish the show.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.613
Next week, a guy who has sex with trees.
No one will remember her!

15:49.406 --> 15:50.950
[laughing]

15:51.033 --> 15:53.243
You should have seen his face, love!

15:53.327 --> 15:56.455
Were you afraid of me, Dodoi?
What's up with that?

15:56.538 --> 15:59.333
[Juninho] Remember when you wanted
to make out with Sandrinha?

15:59.416 --> 16:01.961
I got my aunt's house ready,
you were there for hours.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.672
What happened?
Nothing, man. You're such a chicken.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.550
-I was 13, Juninho.
-At 13, I already had two daughters.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.012
And I consider them my own!
Look at this cute pic!

16:12.513 --> 16:15.349
-Laila, that's you naked.
-I know. I changed the subject.

16:15.432 --> 16:18.018
This party is awful. I don't know anyone.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.520
Just fucking gatecrashers!

16:19.603 --> 16:22.606
Where is Tizio, where is Guile?
Where's Big Head?

16:22.940 --> 16:25.192
I'll take you to a party
that is super trendy.

16:25.275 --> 16:28.028
-What's this, Juninho?
-[Juninho] A little treat for my niece.

16:28.112 --> 16:31.323
We'll drop it on the way. I stop the car,
you don't need to get out. -[Juninho] Drop it and leave.
-Why do you give gifts to your niece?

16:35.119 --> 16:38.414
-[man] <i>What is this, you son of a bitch?</i>
-[police sirens]

16:39.123 --> 16:42.042
We've just discovered the biggest secret
of the Plimploms.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.169
Let's make a pact. We'll never--

16:44.253 --> 16:46.046
Never tell Mom that on their album

16:46.130 --> 16:48.257
there's a subliminal message
to sell ketchup!

16:48.340 --> 16:51.010
-I think that pizza made me sick.
-[bee buzzing]

16:51.093 --> 16:53.303
Did you hear that noise?
I think it was a bee!

16:53.387 --> 16:55.806
You're delirious.
They're all in the bathroom.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.182
[buzzing]

16:57.266 --> 16:58.767
Oh, my God!

16:58.851 --> 17:00.853
Oh! I cannot die!

17:00.936 --> 17:03.230
My autobiography
hasn't been published yet.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.733
I don't want to be a posthumous author!

17:05.816 --> 17:08.152
-[both scream]
-[bee buzzes]

17:09.611 --> 17:12.740
Good evening!
Before we go to our last segment,

17:12.823 --> 17:15.784
I wanted to say goodbye
to our friend Liliane

17:15.867 --> 17:17.994
and tell you something very important:

17:18.494 --> 17:21.040
when I thought about bringing back
the Plimploms,

17:21.123 --> 17:23.000
I had a very clear idea in my head,

17:23.083 --> 17:26.712
which was to rescue that time of love
when people sat in front of the--

17:26.795 --> 17:30.007
Samantha, nobody can live in the past!

17:30.090 --> 17:31.842
So what are you doing here?

17:31.925 --> 17:35.387
I'm here because, as a Plimplom,
I couldn't let the show flop.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.098
And there will be no goodbyes!

17:38.682 --> 17:44.605
Me and my helpers, we're going
to bring some joy into your homes.

17:44.688 --> 17:48.358
But just a little bit, because life
is also made of disappointment,

17:48.442 --> 17:50.819
sadness, and scenes with corpses!

17:51.945 --> 17:53.739
Well, shall we finish with a song?

17:54.239 --> 17:55.115
<i>Hi guys,</i>

17:55.199 --> 17:58.410
<i>I can't speak too loud</i>
<i>because we are in a super tight situation.</i>

17:58.494 --> 17:59.828
<i>Right, Dodoi?</i>

17:59.912 --> 18:01.830
[police sirens]

18:01.914 --> 18:05.918
<i>The hashtag of the day is:</i>
<i>"Is risky love tastier?"</i>

18:06.001 --> 18:08.003
<i>-The best story will win a--</i>
-[gunshot]

18:08.087 --> 18:09.797
-[gunshots]
-Was that a gunshot, guys?

18:09.880 --> 18:12.508
At my party? Wanna screw me over again?

18:12.591 --> 18:14.510
What's with all this resentment?

18:14.593 --> 18:16.804
I was in prison
because of one of your parties!

18:16.887 --> 18:19.014
Not because of me!
There were no innocents!

18:19.098 --> 18:21.350
You could have jumped the fence!

18:21.433 --> 18:23.977
I have two children, OK?
I'm not getting arrested again.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.939
[knocking] Open up, Juninho!
You're surrounded! Police!

18:27.022 --> 18:28.482
[knocking]

18:31.902 --> 18:35.656
[bees buzz]

18:36.532 --> 18:38.992
-[Cindy] We're screwed.
-You said it would be OK!

18:39.076 --> 18:40.410
Because I'm the big sister!

18:40.494 --> 18:42.704
But Dad is not coming back
and Mom will be late.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.833
-This is the end.
-I haven't even finished writing my book!

18:46.583 --> 18:50.671
But think about this:
we're going to die saving the world.

18:51.338 --> 18:55.050
Has anyone here ever seen a UFO?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.218
Yeah!

18:56.927 --> 19:01.306
-We all saw it, remember?
-Come, Porky, it's your time to shine.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.724
Of course I do.

19:02.808 --> 19:06.061
Ciggy, this one's for you! It went--

19:06.145 --> 19:08.564
-Enough! You schemer!
-Don't talk to her like that!

19:08.647 --> 19:12.192
Now you're the one who can't stand
the pressure of the stage, Samantha!

19:12.276 --> 19:15.404
You may have the voice,
but that's not what made this group.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.738
It was my talent.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.575
Even if you hadn't left,
you wouldn't be here.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.827
Because you weren't born to shine!

19:22.619 --> 19:24.454
You can have the fame.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.040
You can have the name.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.209
You can have history with the gang.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.794
[Liliane] But I...

19:32.212 --> 19:34.506
-I have the ability to fight!
-You have what?

19:34.798 --> 19:37.968
I've prepared myself for this day
for 30 years!

19:38.051 --> 19:39.970
Is it your job to interrupt success?

19:40.053 --> 19:42.097
30 years and you have nothing better?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.266
I planned this far,
but now I'm improvising.

19:44.349 --> 19:47.811
Ahh! None of you have the right
to host this show!

19:48.353 --> 19:52.566
We are going to sing "Porky's Diner",
which is a song that everyone knows--

19:52.649 --> 19:57.946
[Tico] Hold on, hold it.
Why didn't I ever have a solo song?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.531
They're completely crazy!

19:59.615 --> 20:02.701
Director, focus here on me, please.
I'm ready for my close-up.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.537
-I want a close-up!
-[Liliane] How rude!

20:05.621 --> 20:08.498
-[Alfonso] Excuse me, Tico!
-[Tico] This is my close-up!

20:08.582 --> 20:10.167
Fight back, damn it!

20:28.727 --> 20:32.189
I thought I didn't need anyone, but I do.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.608
But it's not you guys.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.996
Good night, Plimploms.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.125
This is the last time I call you that.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.170
It's time to grow up.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.970
Samantha, get back on stage now!
What are you doing?

21:03.053 --> 21:04.763
Want to do your knitting segment?

21:04.846 --> 21:07.683
Let's do it! I have a good
ketchup brand contact.

21:07.766 --> 21:12.062
Do you want me to crawl?
Want to step on me, angel? Go on!

21:12.145 --> 21:13.939
Samantha. Do something!

21:21.029 --> 21:22.572
[woman] Hey, cutie!

21:24.616 --> 21:25.909
[woman] Samantha?

21:27.369 --> 21:28.578
Remember me?

21:28.954 --> 21:30.455
Samantha, right?

21:30.539 --> 21:33.458
Symantha with a "Y".
Because there's only one Samantha.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.961
-Would you take a photo with me?
-Sure, I'll do it.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.421
The originals!

21:38.880 --> 21:42.259
Yeah, love, could I borrow
your phone really quick?

21:42.342 --> 21:44.469
-Of course!
-Be right back.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.263
[dialing]

21:46.346 --> 21:47.806
[dialing tone]

21:48.557 --> 21:49.975
<i>-</i> [Dodoi] <i>Yeah.</i>
-Hi, Dodoi.

21:50.267 --> 21:53.353
-Can we talk?
<i>-</i> [Dodoi] <i>I'm screwed.</i>

21:53.645 --> 21:54.604
What happened?

21:55.814 --> 21:57.107
I'll explain later.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.067
[Samantha] <i>Tell me where you are.</i>

21:59.151 --> 22:00.777
I'll come and get you now.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.073
<i>I love you, Liliane!</i>

22:05.157 --> 22:07.284
<i>I didn't run away! I discharged myself!</i>

22:07.367 --> 22:10.329
<i>If anyone has a right to be</i>
<i>the new Samantha, it's me!</i>

22:10.412 --> 22:11.830
<i>This show needs a woman!</i>

22:11.913 --> 22:13.957
But that person is me!

22:21.214 --> 22:24.384
<i>-</i> [Liliane] <i>No way, you're not a woman!</i>
<i>-</i> [Alfonso] <i>It's me!</i>

22:30.724 --> 22:32.976
[Samantha] Didn't you have
a better place to hide?

22:35.687 --> 22:39.066
-Are the police downstairs?
-[Samantha] I explained your situation.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.734
[Samantha] They felt sorry for you.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.195
What "situation"?

22:43.278 --> 22:48.742
You know how it is, right, Dodoi?
Being away from your kids, out of shape...

22:49.076 --> 22:50.827
It makes a person reach their limit.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.080
Are you trying to destroy me?
I'm on the edge.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.332
That's exactly what I told them.

22:55.916 --> 22:59.294
But I also promised
that I wouldn't let you do anything crazy.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.548
There's a drink with your name down there.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.092
"Dodoi on the rocks"!

23:05.175 --> 23:07.010
[both laugh]

23:12.599 --> 23:15.102
It's not my signature, Dodoi.
It's my autograph.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.605
My autograph has a heart,
my signature has a star.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.745
There's a rumor
that this drink is an aphrodisiac--

23:42.254 --> 23:44.214
-Shall we go home?
-Yeah.

23:44.297 --> 23:49.386
[police] <i>Easy, Dodoi! Don't do</i>
<i>anything hasty. Your family loves you!</i>

23:49.719 --> 23:53.223
-What exactly did you say to them?
-Shall we stay here a bit longer?

23:53.807 --> 23:56.601
-OK.
<i>-</i> [police] <i>We're here for your safety!</i>

24:04.860 --> 24:08.196
Who's there? Watch out, I'm armed!
My husband is dangerous!

24:08.280 --> 24:10.991
-Dodoi, unleash the dog!
-Careful! I'm unleashing it!

24:11.241 --> 24:13.368
[Cindy] <i>I don't want</i>
<i>to get grounded again!</i>

24:14.286 --> 24:17.414
[Brandon] <i>Be quiet, Cindy!</i>
<i>Mom might hear us!</i>

24:22.669 --> 24:23.962
What are you doing there?

24:24.045 --> 24:28.258
-[Cindy] Mom, I brought a bunch of bees.
-[Brandon] She brought this stuff!

24:28.341 --> 24:30.218
[Cindy] I didn't know he was allergic!

24:30.302 --> 24:34.514
Calm down! Come on, my babies.
It's OK now!

24:35.056 --> 24:38.476
[Samantha] Give me a kiss.
Mom's beautiful baby!

24:38.935 --> 24:40.228
What's going on?

24:40.312 --> 24:44.065
-[car horns beeping]
-[commotion outside]

24:45.525 --> 24:48.486
There are lots of reporters!
They're selling masks of Mom's face!

24:49.154 --> 24:52.908
-Because Mom is actually famous, Brandon.
-[Brandon] More people are coming!

24:52.991 --> 24:54.034
[car horns beeping]

24:54.743 --> 24:57.329
There's a banner:
"Samantha for President!"

24:57.412 --> 25:00.248
-[laughing] "Samantha for President!"
-No, Dodoi, seriously!

25:00.332 --> 25:02.167
I need to think about the future.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.754
-And I'm an honest person.
-Off to a bad start, then.

25:05.837 --> 25:09.174
No, wait! I am charismatic,
I'm disciplined,

25:09.633 --> 25:10.759
I'm communicative...

25:11.509 --> 25:14.387
and what matters the most
is I love this country!

25:16.890 --> 25:20.310
If that's what people want,
who am I to say no?

25:22.229 --> 25:24.606
What matters is
that you never stop believing!
