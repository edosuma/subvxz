00:31.479 --> 00:32.647
Welcome, welcome,

00:32.714 --> 00:33.448
welcome to "last week tonight!"

00:33.515 --> 00:34.482
I'm John Oliver.

00:34.549 --> 00:36.384
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:36.451 --> 00:38.353
Just time for a quick
recap of the week.

00:38.420 --> 00:39.321
And we're going to focus on a

00:39.387 --> 00:40.989
couple of stories
out of britain.

00:41.056 --> 00:42.223
First, brexit, which I believe

00:42.290 --> 00:43.725
is short for "brain exit," the

00:43.792 --> 00:44.960
official word for when

00:45.026 --> 00:45.994
everything that makes sense goes

00:46.061 --> 00:47.395
out the window and everyone is

00:47.462 --> 00:49.030
just stupid all the time.

00:49.097 --> 00:50.298
Britain was supposed to have

00:50.365 --> 00:51.466
left the e. U. By Friday, but the

00:51.533 --> 00:54.569
day before the deadline,
this happened.

00:54.636 --> 00:56.338
The u. K. Is heading for a

00:56.404 --> 00:58.039
Halloween brexit after the e. U.

00:58.106 --> 00:59.374
Extended the deadline for

00:59.441 --> 01:02.944
withdrawal until
October the 31st.

01:03.011 --> 01:05.346
"Halloween brexit"?

01:05.413 --> 01:06.748
Look, brexit is plenty scary

01:06.815 --> 01:10.485
enough without adding
Halloween to it.

01:10.552 --> 01:11.853
It's like we found out there was

01:11.920 --> 01:13.221
a meteor rapidly approaching

01:13.288 --> 01:14.789
earth and named it "weinstein."

01:14.856 --> 01:16.091
It's overkill.

01:16.157 --> 01:19.594
It's complete overkill
at that point.

01:19.661 --> 01:20.228
But it is true, the brexit

01:20.295 --> 01:22.998
deadline has been
delayed until October.

01:23.064 --> 01:24.866
Now, what will they do
with the extra time?

01:24.899 --> 01:25.467
Who knows?

01:25.533 --> 01:26.134
It's hard to imagine that

01:26.201 --> 01:27.035
unsolvable problems ‐‐ like how

01:27.102 --> 01:27.702
to create a hard border with

01:27.769 --> 01:28.436
Ireland without sparking

01:28.503 --> 01:29.671
sectarian violence ‐‐

01:29.738 --> 01:31.473
will suddenly be solved
within six months.

01:31.539 --> 01:32.807
And many, many British people

01:32.874 --> 01:35.210
seem exhausted by the extension.

01:35.276 --> 01:36.244
I imagine in six months' time

01:36.311 --> 01:37.379
we'll probably be in the same

01:37.445 --> 01:38.880
place we're at now, another

01:38.947 --> 01:39.781
stalemate where it's either

01:39.848 --> 01:41.583
gonna get suspended ‐‐ extended

01:41.650 --> 01:44.252
another six months or who knows?

01:44.319 --> 01:45.320
Oh, god.

01:45.387 --> 01:48.757
Another six months
talking about brexit?

01:48.823 --> 01:50.592
Yeah, I can
see how she feels.

01:50.659 --> 01:51.926
Or at least I could before

01:51.993 --> 01:53.428
brexit interviews started

01:53.495 --> 01:54.295
featuring people being casually

01:54.362 --> 01:56.898
eaten by parrots when they talk.

01:56.965 --> 01:58.933
I would trade another 18 months

01:59.000 --> 02:00.568
of brexit to find out
more about that man.

02:00.635 --> 02:03.471
Like "how did he
become a Yankees fan?"

02:03.538 --> 02:05.640
And "is that his parrot?"

02:05.707 --> 02:06.741
'Cause if it isn't, that is the

02:06.808 --> 02:07.876
calmest I've seen someone stay

02:07.942 --> 02:10.711
during a random televised
parrot attack.

02:10.779 --> 02:11.846
This wasn't even the first time

02:11.913 --> 02:13.481
that the deadline has
been pushed back.

02:13.548 --> 02:14.449
Britain was supposed to leave on

02:14.516 --> 02:15.583
march 29th.

02:15.650 --> 02:16.384
And to hear some brexit

02:16.451 --> 02:17.285
supporters tell it, that's when

02:17.352 --> 02:19.120
it did happen.

02:19.187 --> 02:20.488
The 29th of march should have

02:20.555 --> 02:21.122
been the day we leave, and in my

02:21.189 --> 02:23.692
eyes, we've left.

02:23.758 --> 02:25.226
But it's not and you haven't.

02:25.293 --> 02:26.361
So what?

02:26.428 --> 02:27.996
In my eyes, we have.

02:28.063 --> 02:28.863
Today is our independence day,

02:28.930 --> 02:29.764
and whether we have it or not,

02:29.831 --> 02:31.332
we're celebrating it.

02:31.399 --> 02:33.368
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

02:33.435 --> 02:34.335
Hold on, hold on.

02:34.402 --> 02:35.570
If all that matters to brexit

02:35.637 --> 02:36.571
supporters is what happens

02:36.638 --> 02:38.673
"in their eyes," we may've found

02:38.740 --> 02:40.241
Cancel brexit, but

02:40.308 --> 02:42.177
allow everyone to say it

02:42.243 --> 02:44.479
happened if it makes
them feel better.

02:44.546 --> 02:45.847
That way, no devastating

02:45.914 --> 02:46.915
economic consequences and brexit

02:46.981 --> 02:47.882
supporters get to live happily

02:47.949 --> 02:48.883
ever after in their own personal

02:48.950 --> 02:51.820
"United Kingdom of
the imagination."

02:51.886 --> 02:53.588
But that wasn't the only big

02:53.655 --> 02:54.022
news out of britain.

02:54.089 --> 02:55.590
There was also news concerning

02:55.657 --> 02:56.958
Julian Assange, the most

02:57.025 --> 02:58.093
controversial Australian export

02:58.159 --> 03:00.361
since vegemite.

03:00.428 --> 03:02.864
This week saw a
major development.

03:02.931 --> 03:04.432
Julian Assange arrested.

03:04.499 --> 03:06.134
Julian Assange, now with a

03:06.201 --> 03:06.668
beard, carried out of the

03:06.735 --> 03:07.902
Ecuadorian embassy by London's

03:07.969 --> 03:11.005
metropolitan police.

03:11.072 --> 03:13.174
That bedraggled
beard, lengthy hair.

03:13.241 --> 03:15.243
Looking tired, looking older,

03:15.310 --> 03:17.579
significantly much older.

03:17.645 --> 03:18.747
Looking a very different man

03:18.813 --> 03:19.814
than the one who went into that

03:19.881 --> 03:23.084
embassy some seven years ago.

03:23.151 --> 03:24.219
That's a weird tone to

03:24.285 --> 03:26.287
take on a story that
is this important.

03:26.354 --> 03:27.255
"Yes, his arrest sparks a

03:27.322 --> 03:28.356
difficult debate about the

03:28.423 --> 03:29.290
efficacy of journalistic

03:29.357 --> 03:30.225
protections in the age of

03:30.291 --> 03:32.894
cyber‐espionage, but
look how bad he looks!

03:32.961 --> 03:34.395
He looks like a peeled potato

03:34.462 --> 03:35.029
rolled in spiderwebs.

03:35.096 --> 03:37.432
He looks like Kenneth
Branagh's ghost.

03:37.499 --> 03:39.701
He looks like Gandalf
fucked his stick.

03:39.768 --> 03:41.636
We're having fun.

03:41.703 --> 03:43.171
We're having fun, aren't we?"

03:43.238 --> 03:44.706
But, look, this is a big deal.

03:44.773 --> 03:46.407
Julian Assange has now been

03:46.474 --> 03:47.442
kicked out of the Ecuadorian

03:47.509 --> 03:49.611
embassy after spending
seven years there.

03:49.677 --> 03:54.082
And part of the reason they

03:54.149 --> 03:55.350
may have wanted him out may be

03:55.416 --> 03:56.584
that he did not make life easy

03:56.651 --> 03:57.218
for his hosts.

03:57.285 --> 03:57.986
There have been reports for

03:58.052 --> 03:58.787
some time that assange was sort

03:58.853 --> 04:00.021
of ‐‐ had outlived his welcome

04:00.088 --> 04:01.156
there in the embassy for all

04:01.222 --> 04:02.123
sorts of reasons, including

04:02.190 --> 04:03.925
his ‐‐ you know, that his cat

04:03.992 --> 04:05.426
had been making a mess and that

04:05.493 --> 04:07.462
he was skateboarding
in the halls.

04:07.529 --> 04:09.764
Stealing wi‐fi.

04:09.831 --> 04:11.499
Oh, that's not all.

04:11.566 --> 04:12.600
The ambassador also said that

04:12.667 --> 04:13.968
assange's indoor soccer games

04:14.035 --> 04:15.470
had destroyed embassy equipment

04:15.537 --> 04:16.504
and the government had to

04:16.571 --> 04:19.307
require him to start
cleaning his bathroom.

04:19.374 --> 04:20.675
And, look, at some point in our

04:20.742 --> 04:22.277
lives, we have all lived with

04:22.343 --> 04:23.578
someone like this, and we wished

04:23.645 --> 04:25.046
that we could have British

04:25.113 --> 04:26.548
police carry them out of our

04:26.614 --> 04:28.650
building like a hastily
rolled carpet.

04:28.716 --> 04:29.884
And, look, it's easy to dislike

04:29.951 --> 04:31.386
Julian Assange.

04:31.452 --> 04:33.655
He first fled to the embassy to

04:33.721 --> 04:35.790
escape extradition to Sweden on

04:35.857 --> 04:37.759
rape charges, charges he denies.

04:37.826 --> 04:40.028
And alongside the valuable

04:40.094 --> 04:41.496
information that wikileaks has

04:41.563 --> 04:42.764
helped release, they've also

04:42.831 --> 04:43.765
recklessly published the

04:43.832 --> 04:44.732
sensitive personal data of

04:44.799 --> 04:47.402
hundreds of ordinary people,

04:47.468 --> 04:48.937
potentially putting
lives at risk.

04:49.003 --> 04:50.939
And that's not even getting into

04:51.005 --> 04:51.472
the fact that wikileak's

04:51.539 --> 04:52.373
publication of hacked emails in

04:52.440 --> 04:53.708
2016 helped elect
trump president.

04:53.775 --> 04:55.076
So you're allowed not to like

04:55.143 --> 04:56.211
him, but America's current

04:56.277 --> 04:57.579
attempts to extradite him hang

04:57.645 --> 04:58.479
on a specific charge that many

04:58.546 --> 05:00.014
press advocates find unsettling.

05:00.081 --> 05:01.583
The u. S. Justice department

05:01.649 --> 05:02.784
has charged him with conspiracy

05:02.851 --> 05:04.652
to commit computer intrusion.

05:04.719 --> 05:06.221
Authorities are accusing assange

05:06.287 --> 05:07.522
of conspiring to crack a

05:07.589 --> 05:08.857
password in order to obtain

05:08.923 --> 05:11.893
classified government documents.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.127
Now, that charge stems

05:13.194 --> 05:14.095
from his correspondence with

05:14.162 --> 05:15.230
Chelsea Manning before the

05:15.296 --> 05:16.397
publication of classified

05:16.464 --> 05:17.298
documents in 2010.

05:17.365 --> 05:18.800
And on its face, it currently

05:18.867 --> 05:20.401
seems more than a little flimsy,

05:20.468 --> 05:21.870
prompting the committee to

05:21.936 --> 05:23.605
protect journalists to call it

05:23.671 --> 05:24.539
"troubling for press freedom,"

05:24.606 --> 05:25.607
because the indictment's

05:25.673 --> 05:26.708
language seems to criminalize a

05:26.774 --> 05:27.742
broad range of legally protected

05:27.809 --> 05:30.311
and common
journalistic activity.

05:30.378 --> 05:31.880
And while it is still early at

05:31.946 --> 05:32.847
this point and we don't know

05:32.914 --> 05:33.882
what else assange might be

05:33.948 --> 05:34.983
charged with, or even whether

05:35.049 --> 05:36.317
the u. K. Will extradite him at

05:36.384 --> 05:37.719
all, this story is worrying for

05:37.785 --> 05:38.786
One,

05:38.853 --> 05:40.121
because journalistic freedoms

05:40.188 --> 05:42.690
may be under threat.

05:42.757 --> 05:44.158
And two, unfortunately, in order

05:44.225 --> 05:45.493
to protect them, we may be

05:45.560 --> 05:47.061
forced to utter the one phrase

05:47.128 --> 05:48.496
in the english language scarier

05:48.563 --> 05:50.064
than "Halloween brexit" and

05:50.131 --> 05:51.432
that's, "I'm really sorry,

05:51.499 --> 05:53.801
everyone, but it might actually

05:53.868 --> 05:54.702
be time to defend
Julian Assange."

05:54.769 --> 05:56.137
And now this.

05:56.204 --> 05:59.641
And now, why
would you say that?

05:59.707 --> 06:02.744
Amazon earned $92
million last quarter.

06:02.810 --> 06:06.748
You know why?

06:06.814 --> 06:07.949
'Cause they sell sex toys and

06:08.016 --> 06:09.918
Walmart can't or
won't sell sex toys.

06:09.984 --> 06:11.152
Amazon does.

06:11.219 --> 06:12.820
A friend of mine works
in the warehouse.

06:12.887 --> 06:13.721
He says they sell a ton of them.

06:13.788 --> 06:14.923
Yeah.

06:14.989 --> 06:16.591
I'm just telling you how it is.

06:16.658 --> 06:18.059
Are you smelling me?

06:18.126 --> 06:20.194
Eh, sniffing you a little bit.

06:20.261 --> 06:26.935
You smell good.

06:27.001 --> 06:28.102
Hooters girl Rachel
is here live.

06:28.169 --> 06:29.470
How do I know?

06:29.537 --> 06:29.904
I just touched her.

06:29.971 --> 06:30.705
The weather is kind of like

06:30.772 --> 06:38.246
Harvey weinstein, assaulting us

06:38.313 --> 06:39.414
today with the heat
and temperatures.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.114
Okay, Charlie, I'm going to

06:40.181 --> 06:41.349
sit here and hang out with my

06:41.382 --> 06:41.782
new best friend.

06:41.816 --> 06:42.550
I think you two should get a

06:42.617 --> 06:43.251
hotel room or something.

06:43.318 --> 06:44.316
That's a lot of action
going on over there.

06:44.385 --> 06:46.621
Everybody wants a yoga
girl, right, Jason?

06:46.688 --> 06:49.457
That's right.

06:49.524 --> 06:53.061
- All right, on that note...
- Moving on.

06:53.127 --> 06:55.563
Our main story tonight
concerns drugs.

06:55.630 --> 06:56.731
On one hand, America's war on

06:56.798 --> 07:01.869
them has been a complete

07:01.936 --> 07:02.537
catastrophe, but on the other

07:02.603 --> 07:03.438
hand, it did also give

07:03.504 --> 07:04.138
us this photo of Nancy Reagan

07:04.205 --> 07:05.406
sitting on Mr. t's lap, so it

07:05.473 --> 07:06.174
wasn't a complete loss.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.041
And by the way, I pity the fool

07:07.108 --> 07:08.409
that didn't think they were

07:08.476 --> 07:13.081
gonna fuck after that.

07:13.147 --> 07:14.315
Specifically, specifically,

07:14.382 --> 07:15.416
we're going to talk
about opioids.

07:15.483 --> 07:16.017
And if you're thinking, "hold

07:16.084 --> 07:17.018
on, didn't you do a
show on this before?"

07:17.051 --> 07:18.386
Yeah, we did one two
and a half years ago.

07:18.453 --> 07:19.887
But tonight, we're going to do

07:19.954 --> 07:21.622
an update for a couple
of key reasons.

07:21.689 --> 07:23.391
First, the epidemic
is very much ongoing.

07:23.458 --> 07:24.359
In 2017, opioid overdoses killed

07:24.425 --> 07:28.529
more than 47,000 Americans.

07:28.596 --> 07:29.931
And second, since then, we've

07:29.998 --> 07:30.698
learned a lot more about many of

07:30.765 --> 07:31.332
the companies involved, and some

07:31.399 --> 07:32.900
of it has been amazing.

07:32.967 --> 07:34.135
For instance, a criminal case

07:34.202 --> 07:35.737
involving executives from the

07:35.803 --> 07:37.472
drugmaker insys unearthed a

07:37.538 --> 07:39.273
rap video they allegedly made to

07:39.340 --> 07:41.943
motivate their sales force to go

07:42.010 --> 07:42.610
out and sell a painkiller

07:42.677 --> 07:43.344
containing the highly addictive

07:43.411 --> 07:47.382
drug fentanyl.

07:47.448 --> 07:47.982
Take a look.

08:10.338 --> 08:11.372
Yes.

08:11.439 --> 08:12.407
Beast.

08:12.473 --> 08:13.207
Let's just stop for a moment to

08:13.274 --> 08:14.475
unpack the line, "if you're

08:14.542 --> 08:15.376
trying to ball, I'll substitute

08:15.443 --> 08:16.344
you like a xylitol."

08:16.411 --> 08:17.678
That is a reference to the key

08:17.745 --> 08:18.646
ingredient in sugar‐free gum.

08:18.713 --> 08:19.547
It is astonishingly, almost

08:19.614 --> 08:22.583
impossibly lame.

08:22.650 --> 08:23.851
It is genuinely difficult to

08:23.918 --> 08:25.586
come up with a rap
that's lamer that that.

08:25.653 --> 08:26.320
"Splash rules

08:26.387 --> 08:27.021
everything around me.

08:27.088 --> 08:28.256
Hanks get the mermaid.

08:28.322 --> 08:30.458
Daryl Daryl Hannah y'all."

08:30.525 --> 08:32.126
Now, is that lame?

08:32.193 --> 08:32.994
Is that lame?

08:33.061 --> 08:33.861
Yes.

08:33.928 --> 08:35.663
Is it lamer than
the insys video?

08:35.730 --> 08:36.998
I think it's hard for you to

08:37.065 --> 08:37.999
make that case.

08:38.066 --> 08:39.833
And that rap video was just the

08:39.900 --> 08:41.001
tip of the iceberg in terms of

08:41.068 --> 08:42.336
new information now coming out

08:42.403 --> 08:43.671
through numerous court cases.

08:43.738 --> 08:45.239
So tonight, let's pull a few of

08:45.306 --> 08:46.541
these new revelations together

08:46.607 --> 08:47.708
and look at what we've learned

08:47.775 --> 08:49.010
about how the first wave of the

08:49.077 --> 08:51.345
opioid crisis began, because

08:51.412 --> 08:53.081
it's a story of how major

08:53.147 --> 08:54.215
companies acted wildly

08:54.282 --> 08:55.583
irresponsibly, skirted any

08:55.650 --> 08:56.584
meaningful consequences, and for

08:56.651 --> 08:59.053
the most part, avoided
public scrutiny.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.355
And let's start with
drug distributors.

09:01.422 --> 09:02.824
These are the big three.

09:02.890 --> 09:03.758
They're the companies

09:03.825 --> 09:05.059
responsible for getting drugs to

09:05.126 --> 09:06.127
pharmacies and hospitals.

09:06.194 --> 09:07.495
They're supposed to alert

09:07.562 --> 09:08.763
authorities if they notice

09:08.830 --> 09:15.536
suspicious orders of
controlled substances.

09:15.603 --> 09:16.938
But for a sense of just how

09:17.004 --> 09:18.272
badly they failed to do that,

09:18.339 --> 09:19.540
look at Kermit, West Virginia,

09:19.607 --> 09:20.875
named, of course, because it's

09:20.942 --> 09:22.110
where Kermit the frog lives with

09:22.176 --> 09:22.643
his secret second family.

09:22.710 --> 09:23.344
Oh, that's right.

09:23.411 --> 09:24.045
He's in a thruple with

09:24.112 --> 09:24.846
two salamanders named francois

09:24.912 --> 09:26.814
and Gary, and they are
very, very happy.

09:26.881 --> 09:27.615
It was never you, miss piggy.

09:27.682 --> 09:30.017
It was him.

09:30.084 --> 09:31.252
The amount of opioids sent to

09:31.319 --> 09:32.987
Kermit, a town of just 400

09:33.054 --> 09:36.757
people, was utterly ridiculous.

09:36.824 --> 09:38.459
This undercover video of

09:38.526 --> 09:40.228
Kermit's main pharmacy shows

09:40.294 --> 09:42.029
scores of people picking up

09:42.096 --> 09:43.631
prescriptions inside and at the

09:43.698 --> 09:45.466
drive‐thru window.

09:45.533 --> 09:47.335
More than 3 million doses of

09:47.401 --> 09:49.403
hydrocodone were ordered by a

09:49.470 --> 09:50.905
Kermit pharmacist, James wooley,

09:50.972 --> 09:52.607
in one year.

09:52.673 --> 09:55.042
It's true.

09:55.109 --> 09:57.678
3 million doses to a
town of 400 people.

09:57.745 --> 09:58.813
That's around 7500 pills for

09:58.880 --> 10:01.382
every resident in Kermit.

10:01.449 --> 10:02.917
And just to be clear, we mean

10:02.984 --> 10:04.185
every resident in Kermit, not

10:04.252 --> 10:06.420
every resident "in Kermit."

10:06.487 --> 10:07.588
Kermit ‐‐ Kermit is a top, I'll

10:07.655 --> 10:10.057
have you know.

10:10.124 --> 10:13.427
Not that that is any
of your business.

10:13.494 --> 10:14.629
But those sorts of figures

10:14.695 --> 10:15.763
clearly should've caught the

10:15.830 --> 10:17.098
attention of distributors.

10:17.165 --> 10:19.267
In fact, the largest one,

10:19.333 --> 10:20.535
mckesson, alone, shipped

10:20.601 --> 10:21.435
5 million doses of opioids to

10:21.502 --> 10:22.937
Kermit in just two years.

10:23.004 --> 10:24.138
And that's just one example of

10:24.205 --> 10:26.807
mckesson's reckless behavior.

10:26.874 --> 10:27.975
And the problem is, at no point

10:28.042 --> 10:29.710
were they effectively deterred.

10:29.777 --> 10:33.481
In 2008, the DEA alleged

10:33.548 --> 10:34.982
that mckesson had failed to

10:35.049 --> 10:36.184
control its controlled
substances.

10:36.250 --> 10:37.084
Mckesson agreed to pay a

10:37.151 --> 10:38.052
$13 million fine ‐‐

10:38.119 --> 10:39.153
that's all ‐‐ without admitting

10:39.220 --> 10:40.221
wrongdoing, and also promised to

10:40.288 --> 10:41.322
do better by implementing a

10:41.389 --> 10:44.358
controlled substances
monitoring program.

10:44.425 --> 10:48.196
But that emphatically
didn't work.

10:48.262 --> 10:49.864
In fact, a DEA official later

10:49.931 --> 10:50.865
wrote, "their bad acts had

10:50.932 --> 10:52.066
continued and escalated

10:52.133 --> 10:53.301
to a level of egregiousness not

10:53.367 --> 10:55.036
seen before."

10:55.102 --> 10:57.271
Because of course they did.

10:57.338 --> 10:58.573
You can't put mckesson in charge

10:58.639 --> 11:00.741
of monitoring mckesson.

11:00.808 --> 11:02.410
If the bears in your zoo get out

11:02.476 --> 11:03.744
at night and start mauling the

11:03.811 --> 11:05.580
other animals, you don't

11:05.646 --> 11:06.280
deputize one of the bears to

11:06.347 --> 11:07.748
monitor the situation.

11:07.815 --> 11:08.816
And I know what you're thinking.

11:08.883 --> 11:10.718
"But, John, I've already bought

11:10.785 --> 11:11.852
him a little sheriff's outfit to

11:11.919 --> 11:14.622
wear and I think he'd
look great in it."

11:14.689 --> 11:15.990
And yes, of course he would, but

11:16.057 --> 11:17.291
at the end of the day, bears are

11:17.358 --> 11:19.694
gonna bear.

11:19.760 --> 11:20.861
It's just in their nature.

11:20.928 --> 11:21.762
And again, before you say,

11:21.829 --> 11:22.797
"well, I've spent quite a bit of

11:22.863 --> 11:23.731
money designing a custom‐made

11:23.798 --> 11:24.799
sheriff's badge just for him.

11:24.865 --> 11:26.000
Don't you think the bear will

11:26.067 --> 11:27.134
recognize the gravitas of that

11:27.201 --> 11:28.069
symbol and feel compelled to

11:28.135 --> 11:29.937
grow and change his
bear ways in some way?"

11:30.004 --> 11:32.340
No, I don't, because
bears respect nothing.

11:32.406 --> 11:34.308
They think the importance we

11:34.375 --> 11:38.246
place on symbols and status

11:38.312 --> 11:39.080
makes us weak, they value

11:39.146 --> 11:39.714
nothing but blood and strength.

11:39.780 --> 11:46.120
And I know what you're
going to say now.

11:46.187 --> 11:46.787
"Is there anything I can do?"

11:46.854 --> 11:47.822
And the answer, of course, is

11:47.888 --> 11:48.589
no, because while you were

11:48.656 --> 11:49.957
talking, sheriff
bear mauled you.

11:50.024 --> 11:50.858
You're dead.

11:50.925 --> 11:51.959
Goodbye.

11:52.026 --> 11:52.760
The point is, mckesson

11:52.827 --> 11:53.628
monitoring itself clearly didn't

11:53.694 --> 11:57.164
work, because in 2017, they

11:57.231 --> 11:58.266
wound up agreeing to a bigger

11:58.332 --> 11:59.267
fine, this time, $150 million,

11:59.333 --> 12:00.668
which sounds like a lot, until

12:00.735 --> 12:02.036
you realize that's less than one

12:02.103 --> 12:04.672
one‐thousandth of their revenue

12:04.739 --> 12:07.341
for one year.

12:07.408 --> 12:09.677
And while today mckesson says

12:09.744 --> 12:10.144
they've improved their

12:10.211 --> 12:10.911
monitoring systems ‐‐ for

12:10.978 --> 12:13.180
realsies this time,
pinky promise ‐‐

12:13.247 --> 12:15.149
and they argue that they weren't

12:15.216 --> 12:16.317
the ones setting the demand for

12:16.384 --> 12:17.885
opioids at any point, even the

12:17.952 --> 12:19.253
DEA agent in charge of their

12:19.320 --> 12:22.590
case thought their
settlement was absurd.

12:22.657 --> 12:26.861
How do you settle?

12:26.927 --> 12:27.862
How do you say, it's okay, just,

12:27.928 --> 12:29.096
"here, write this check this

12:29.163 --> 12:29.997
time and ‐‐ and close this place

12:30.064 --> 12:30.831
for a little bit, sign this

12:30.898 --> 12:31.365
piece of paper."

12:31.432 --> 12:32.366
How do you do that?

12:32.433 --> 12:33.668
No.

12:33.734 --> 12:34.869
Put 'em in jail.

12:34.935 --> 12:36.170
He's right.

12:36.237 --> 12:39.774
Put 'em in jail!

12:39.840 --> 12:41.075
And honestly, I'd watch an

12:41.142 --> 12:41.809
entire show that's just that guy

12:41.876 --> 12:43.344
telling me where to put things.

12:43.411 --> 12:44.278
Mckesson executives?

12:44.345 --> 12:45.813
"Put 'em in jail!"

12:45.880 --> 12:46.514
These carrots?

12:46.580 --> 12:47.948
"Put 'em in soup!"

12:48.015 --> 12:48.949
This group of corgis?

12:49.016 --> 12:51.152
"Put 'em in tiny boots!

12:51.218 --> 12:54.155
They should be in boots!"

12:54.221 --> 12:56.757
But that is the
big problem here.

12:56.824 --> 12:58.125
For companies involved in the

12:58.192 --> 12:58.993
opioid crisis, fines just became

12:59.060 --> 13:01.195
the cost of doing business.

13:01.262 --> 13:02.930
And throughout this crisis, it's

13:02.997 --> 13:04.632
been difficult to find any real

13:04.699 --> 13:06.000
accountability for the people

13:06.067 --> 13:07.468
involved, and there may be no

13:07.535 --> 13:09.136
more frustrating example of that

13:09.203 --> 13:10.371
than purdue pharma, the

13:10.438 --> 13:12.239
manufacturer behind oxycontin,

13:12.306 --> 13:13.474
the drug that arguably

13:13.541 --> 13:15.209
kickstarted the crisis.

13:15.276 --> 13:16.744
Purdue famously aggressively

13:16.811 --> 13:18.312
marketed oxycontin to doctors as

13:18.379 --> 13:19.780
a less addictive painkiller that

13:19.847 --> 13:21.515
could be used to treat common

13:21.582 --> 13:23.017
conditions like backaches and

13:23.084 --> 13:26.020
knee pain, which was
obviously untrue.

13:26.087 --> 13:27.621
It would be like using cocaine

13:27.688 --> 13:28.956
for a toothache.

13:29.023 --> 13:30.491
Which, incidentally back in the

13:30.558 --> 13:36.697
1800s, people actually did.

13:36.764 --> 13:37.565
What an idea.

13:37.631 --> 13:39.066
"My tooth hurt this morning, but

13:39.133 --> 13:40.368
I took some medicine, and now

13:40.434 --> 13:43.671
I'm really fucking psyched about

13:43.738 --> 13:47.441
20 different business ideas.

13:47.508 --> 13:54.582
I'm going to write a screenplay.

13:54.648 --> 13:56.417
I know it's the 1800s!"

13:56.484 --> 13:57.151
Purdue is owned by members of

13:57.218 --> 13:58.018
the sackler family.

13:58.085 --> 13:58.853
Collectively they're worth an

13:58.919 --> 13:59.620
estimated $13 billion, which has

13:59.687 --> 14:00.521
enabled them to proudly slap

14:00.588 --> 14:01.021
their name on some truly

14:01.088 --> 14:01.655
impressive monuments to other

14:01.722 --> 14:02.289
people's talent.

14:02.356 --> 14:03.257
The sackler name is on parts of

14:03.324 --> 14:04.525
the met, the louvre, the museum

14:04.592 --> 14:05.159
of natural history, the national

14:05.226 --> 14:05.960
gallery in London, the royal

14:06.026 --> 14:06.927
college of art, an institute at

14:06.994 --> 14:08.129
Yale, a library at Oxford,

14:08.195 --> 14:08.963
and the sackler crossing at the

14:09.029 --> 14:11.198
royal botanic gardens.

14:11.265 --> 14:12.833
Not bad for a family whose name

14:12.900 --> 14:14.335
sounds like a hamburglar‐like

14:14.402 --> 14:16.771
villain that steals testicles.

14:16.837 --> 14:18.072
"Oh, no!

14:18.139 --> 14:19.540
The sackler came in the middle

14:19.607 --> 14:21.041
of the night, and now my penis

14:21.108 --> 14:23.811
is shivering!"

14:23.878 --> 14:28.883
The sacklers love putting their

14:28.949 --> 14:29.784
names on things.

14:29.850 --> 14:30.951
Although until very recently,

14:31.018 --> 14:31.685
they've been miraculously good

14:31.752 --> 14:32.887
at keeping their name off the

14:32.953 --> 14:33.320
opioid crisis.

14:33.387 --> 14:35.423
But that is now changing with

14:35.489 --> 14:35.990
protests like this.

14:36.056 --> 14:36.757
In New York City this

14:36.824 --> 14:37.758
weekend, protesters flooded the

14:37.825 --> 14:40.194
guggenheim museum.

14:40.261 --> 14:41.462
They dropped fake prescription

14:41.529 --> 14:42.963
slips from the upper walkway,

14:43.030 --> 14:43.964
angry that the museum takes big

14:44.031 --> 14:45.800
donations from the sackler

14:45.866 --> 14:46.434
family, which has been accused

14:46.500 --> 14:52.807
of engineering the
opioid epidemic.

14:52.873 --> 14:53.641
Wow.

14:53.707 --> 14:54.308
Look, I know this isn't the

14:54.375 --> 14:54.909
point, but spare a thought for

14:54.975 --> 14:55.876
the guggenheim janitor who has

14:55.943 --> 14:56.744
to clean all that up.

14:56.811 --> 14:57.778
Dennis didn't take millions from

14:57.845 --> 14:58.979
the pharmaceutical industry.

14:59.046 --> 15:00.114
Dennis gets $15 an hour and

15:00.181 --> 15:01.549
maybe the occasional chance to

15:01.615 --> 15:04.251
masturbate on a cezanne.

15:04.318 --> 15:05.186
Look, look, hey.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.521
I didn't say he was
a good janitor.

15:07.588 --> 15:10.558
I just said you should
think about him.

15:10.624 --> 15:11.926
The reason for this change in

15:11.992 --> 15:13.027
public perception is a dawning

15:13.093 --> 15:14.462
realization at just how deeply

15:14.528 --> 15:15.896
some of the sacklers were

15:15.963 --> 15:17.498
involved, because unlike most

15:17.565 --> 15:18.699
second‐generation heirs to a

15:18.766 --> 15:21.702
family fortune, some
were very hands‐on.

15:21.769 --> 15:23.304
Richard sackler worked at purdue

15:23.370 --> 15:25.840
throughout the crisis, serving

15:25.906 --> 15:28.876
as president from 1999 to 2003,

15:28.943 --> 15:29.777
and served on the board along

15:29.844 --> 15:31.245
with seven other family members.

15:31.312 --> 15:32.413
And now, thanks to a number of

15:32.480 --> 15:37.384
lawsuits filed by various

15:37.451 --> 15:38.652
states, we're getting glimpses

15:38.719 --> 15:39.587
of Richard's involvement.

15:39.653 --> 15:40.421
Massachusetts alleges that

15:40.488 --> 15:41.455
Richard sackler at one point

15:41.522 --> 15:42.289
demanded to be sent into the

15:42.356 --> 15:44.592
field with sales reps
on visits to doctors.

15:44.658 --> 15:46.460
In fact, his micromanagement was

15:46.527 --> 15:47.161
apparently so extreme that

15:47.228 --> 15:48.329
purdue's vp of sales and

15:48.395 --> 15:49.563
marketing wrote to the ceo,

15:49.630 --> 15:50.865
"anything you can do to reduce

15:50.931 --> 15:52.166
the direct contact of Richard

15:52.233 --> 15:56.070
into the organization
is appreciated."

15:56.136 --> 15:57.538
And going by some of his

15:57.605 --> 15:58.372
statements, this micromanagement

15:58.439 --> 16:01.909
was in service of a
pretty clear purpose.

16:01.976 --> 16:03.277
According to newly filed

16:03.344 --> 16:04.612
court documents, when oxycontin

16:04.678 --> 16:06.180
was first released,

16:06.247 --> 16:07.515
Richard sackler, purdue's former

16:07.581 --> 16:09.283
president and son of the company

16:09.350 --> 16:11.318
founder, is quoted saying at a

16:11.385 --> 16:13.454
company event that the launch

16:13.521 --> 16:14.755
would be followed by a "blizzard

16:14.822 --> 16:16.390
of prescriptions."

16:16.457 --> 16:17.725
Amazingly, the full

16:17.791 --> 16:20.027
quote is actually worse.

16:20.094 --> 16:21.195
He calls it "a blizzard of

16:21.262 --> 16:22.830
prescriptions that will bury the

16:22.897 --> 16:24.732
competition," and then goes on

16:24.798 --> 16:26.300
to say "the blizzard will be so

16:26.367 --> 16:28.269
deep, dense, and white."

16:28.335 --> 16:30.070
And, look, as a tagline for

16:30.137 --> 16:31.839
"frozen 2," that's pretty good,

16:31.906 --> 16:33.173
but it's troubling when applied

16:33.240 --> 16:36.010
to addictive fucking
painkillers.

16:36.076 --> 16:37.478
And Richard sackler's glib tone

16:37.545 --> 16:38.913
continued, even as purdue began

16:38.979 --> 16:40.414
to see the consequences of the

16:40.481 --> 16:43.183
drugs that they were pushing.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.119
At the dawn of the opioid

16:45.185 --> 16:46.086
epidemic, when 59 deaths were

16:46.153 --> 16:47.788
reported in a single state,

16:47.855 --> 16:49.590
purdue's president wrote, "this

16:49.657 --> 16:51.091
is not too bad.

16:51.158 --> 16:53.561
It could have been far worse."

16:53.627 --> 16:55.262
Wow.

16:55.329 --> 16:57.298
That is both callous and also

16:57.364 --> 16:58.465
completely besides the point,

16:58.532 --> 16:59.500
because the phrase "it could

16:59.567 --> 17:01.135
have been worse" can be applied

17:01.201 --> 17:01.635
to literally anything.

17:01.702 --> 17:03.437
In fact, one of the only things

17:03.504 --> 17:05.005
it cannot apply to is

17:05.071 --> 17:05.573
Richard sackler's statement

17:05.638 --> 17:10.344
regarding those 59 deaths.

17:10.411 --> 17:11.878
And I have to say, I'm just not

17:11.945 --> 17:17.483
sure the full horror of that

17:17.550 --> 17:20.588
comment comes across when you

17:20.654 --> 17:22.122
just hear a guy
reading it on TV.

17:22.189 --> 17:22.856
And the problem is, we have to

17:22.923 --> 17:23.557
use clips like that because

17:23.624 --> 17:25.159
there are no clips
of Richard sackler.

17:25.224 --> 17:25.925
He never does interviews.

17:25.992 --> 17:26.827
Even that photo is one of only a

17:26.894 --> 17:28.295
small handful we could find.

17:28.362 --> 17:29.430
And think of how remarkable that

17:29.496 --> 17:30.798
is in and of itself.

17:30.864 --> 17:32.166
He's an incredibly rich man, and

17:32.232 --> 17:33.400
it's genuinely easier to find

17:33.467 --> 17:35.169
multiple image options of birds

17:35.235 --> 17:37.438
standing on turtles or babies

17:37.504 --> 17:41.075
that look like Wallace Shawn.

17:41.141 --> 17:42.409
And lets all agree, those babies

17:42.476 --> 17:48.983
look a lot like Wallace Shawn.

17:49.049 --> 17:50.217
And this ‐‐ this invisibility

17:50.284 --> 17:51.185
feels deliberate.

17:51.251 --> 17:51.952
And whether it is or not, it has

17:52.019 --> 17:52.987
definitely been convenient for

17:53.053 --> 17:54.121
Richard sackler, because it's

17:54.188 --> 17:55.356
honestly hard to tell the story

17:55.422 --> 18:00.127
of his time at purdue
without any video.

18:00.194 --> 18:01.428
There is only so long anyone

18:01.495 --> 18:02.196
will listen to someone at a desk

18:02.262 --> 18:03.364
reading from court documents.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.766
Trust me, I know that.

18:05.833 --> 18:09.003
I'm painfully aware of that.

18:09.069 --> 18:10.070
So tonight, we've actually done

18:10.137 --> 18:11.672
something unusual.

18:11.739 --> 18:13.173
To help you get the emotional

18:13.240 --> 18:14.208
impact of Richard sackler's

18:14.274 --> 18:17.344
actual words, we got
an actor to play him.

18:17.411 --> 18:18.212
So let's ‐‐ let's try that last

18:18.278 --> 18:19.346
quote again.

18:19.413 --> 18:20.614
Richard sackler, a news article

18:20.681 --> 18:21.715
about oxycontin addiction says

18:21.782 --> 18:23.784
it's caused 59 deaths
in a single state.

18:23.851 --> 18:27.521
How do you respond?

18:27.588 --> 18:29.890
This is not too bad.

18:29.957 --> 18:31.659
It could have been far worse.

18:31.725 --> 18:33.160
That's right.

18:33.227 --> 18:35.596
We got Michael fucking Keaton.

18:35.663 --> 18:38.832
Because ‐‐ and
I'll tell you why.

18:38.899 --> 18:40.200
Because when you're casting for

18:40.267 --> 18:41.035
a shadowy heir to a vast fortune

18:41.101 --> 18:42.403
who doesn't like to be in the

18:42.469 --> 18:43.871
limelight, you go Batman.

18:43.937 --> 18:46.540
And, look, that helps
a little bit, right?

18:46.607 --> 18:47.875
Here, let's try another one.

18:47.941 --> 18:49.043
As evidence mounted that oxy was

18:49.109 --> 18:50.544
causing widespread addiction,

18:50.611 --> 18:51.645
sackler urged the company to

18:51.712 --> 18:54.248
publicly blame those
who were addicted.

18:54.314 --> 18:58.218
Michael Keaton, what
did he actually write?

18:58.285 --> 18:59.453
We have to hammer on the

18:59.520 --> 19:01.455
abusers in every way possible.

19:01.522 --> 19:05.359
They are the culprits
and the problem.

19:05.426 --> 19:14.668
They are reckless criminals.

19:14.735 --> 19:16.070
Sackler
genuinely wrote that.

19:16.136 --> 19:17.104
Not only does that come off as

19:17.171 --> 19:17.705
malicious and cold‐hearted, it

19:17.771 --> 19:18.272
also doesn't make any sense.

19:18.338 --> 19:19.173
He's furious at people who are

19:19.239 --> 19:20.274
part of the problem, but the

19:20.340 --> 19:21.141
people he's angry at helped make

19:21.208 --> 19:22.643
him incredibly rich.

19:22.710 --> 19:23.877
You don't see Adam levine

19:23.944 --> 19:25.145
releasing a song condemning

19:25.212 --> 19:26.547
horny middle‐aged women because

19:26.613 --> 19:28.716
that would be hypocritical.

19:28.782 --> 19:30.117
Who do you think made you who

19:30.184 --> 19:36.390
you are, Adam?

19:36.457 --> 19:37.057
It's your "just dangerous

19:37.124 --> 19:37.825
enough for suburban moms to

19:37.891 --> 19:38.459
masturbate to" energy that got

19:38.525 --> 19:39.259
you where you are today.

19:39.326 --> 19:43.330
Show some respect
for your base, son.

19:43.397 --> 19:45.065
Now, now, for legal reasons, I

19:45.132 --> 19:46.366
have to tell you the sacklers

19:46.433 --> 19:47.668
and purdue insist the family

19:47.735 --> 19:49.169
didn't cause the opioid crisis

19:49.236 --> 19:50.471
and vigorously deny the claims

19:50.537 --> 19:51.739
in the lawsuits we've mentioned,

19:51.805 --> 19:52.706
saying that Richard sackler's

19:52.773 --> 19:54.441
comments have been taken out of

19:54.508 --> 19:55.142
context, with quotes

19:55.209 --> 19:56.443
cherry‐picked from among tens of

19:56.510 --> 19:57.644
millions of other emails and

19:57.711 --> 19:59.813
business documents.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.715
But two things about that.

20:01.782 --> 20:02.583
First, whenever they've added

20:02.649 --> 20:04.918
context, it hasn't
really helped much.

20:04.985 --> 20:06.086
For instance, their explanation

20:06.153 --> 20:08.055
for sackler saying the news of

20:08.122 --> 20:10.090
59 deaths was "not too bad" was

20:10.157 --> 20:11.391
that he was "merely commenting

20:11.458 --> 20:16.163
about the nature of recent press

20:16.230 --> 20:18.165
coverage," which is not better

20:18.232 --> 20:19.166
in any meaningful way.

20:19.233 --> 20:20.000
As for that "blizzard of

20:20.067 --> 20:20.968
prescriptions" line, they've

20:21.034 --> 20:22.269
claimed the full context for

20:22.336 --> 20:22.970
that is that his remarks were an

20:23.036 --> 20:24.204
allusion to his delayed arrival

20:24.271 --> 20:25.672
at that event due to the

20:25.739 --> 20:29.376
well‐known blizzard of 1996.

20:29.443 --> 20:32.079
Which, again, in no
way exonerates him.

20:32.146 --> 20:33.046
"Oh, hey, guys.

20:33.113 --> 20:34.081
It's not like Richard was

20:34.148 --> 20:35.048
recklessly and callously

20:35.115 --> 20:35.916
anticipating oxycontin's

20:35.983 --> 20:38.452
popularity while
it was sunny out.

20:38.519 --> 20:39.853
It was snowing.

20:39.920 --> 20:42.523
Hello?"

20:42.589 --> 20:44.024
And the thing is, for a family

20:44.091 --> 20:45.292
that complains about a lack of

20:45.359 --> 20:46.693
context, they have fought

20:46.760 --> 20:48.695
tirelessly to withhold it,

20:48.762 --> 20:51.532
because time and again, they

20:51.598 --> 20:52.699
have settled cases on the

20:52.766 --> 20:53.801
condition that evidence will be

20:53.867 --> 20:56.937
sealed and unavailable
to the public.

20:57.004 --> 20:57.871
In fact, a few years back,

20:57.938 --> 20:59.239
purdue settled a lawsuit with

20:59.306 --> 21:00.841
Kentucky on the condition that

21:00.908 --> 21:01.441
the state a. G. Destroy

21:01.508 --> 21:04.077
17 million pages of documents.

21:04.144 --> 21:05.913
17 million pages.

21:05.979 --> 21:07.314
That's an actual blizzard of

21:07.381 --> 21:08.549
context that they did not want

21:08.615 --> 21:10.284
anyone to see.

21:10.350 --> 21:11.552
And you can kind of see why,

21:11.618 --> 21:13.120
because just the glimpses of

21:13.187 --> 21:14.388
information we've seen recently

21:14.454 --> 21:16.156
resulted in that guggenheim

21:16.223 --> 21:17.491
protest, which, in turn, led to

21:17.558 --> 21:18.625
the museum deciding to stop

21:18.692 --> 21:21.028
taking funding
from the sacklers.

21:21.094 --> 21:22.129
And the guggenheim is not the

21:22.196 --> 21:24.798
only institution cutting ties.

21:24.865 --> 21:26.233
The sacklers and London's

21:26.300 --> 21:27.534
national portrait gallery have

21:27.601 --> 21:28.836
mutually agreed to call off a

21:28.902 --> 21:38.011
planned donation $1.3
million donation.

21:38.078 --> 21:38.779
It's true, the

21:38.846 --> 21:39.646
portrait gallery bailed on the

21:39.713 --> 21:40.380
sacklers too.

21:40.447 --> 21:41.281
And I know that, as punishments

21:41.348 --> 21:45.085
go, getting to keep $1.3 million

21:45.152 --> 21:46.520
doesn't sound all
that fucking bad.

21:46.587 --> 21:47.254
But keep in mind that these

21:47.321 --> 21:47.921
people have infinite money and

21:47.988 --> 21:49.423
seem to enjoy nothing more than

21:49.489 --> 21:50.657
using it to purchase
social status.

21:50.724 --> 21:51.325
So not getting to put their name

21:51.391 --> 21:54.127
on things may be a
real punishment.

21:54.194 --> 21:55.462
But I would argue that should

21:55.529 --> 21:56.730
only be half of it.

21:56.797 --> 21:58.098
The other half is having to put

21:58.165 --> 21:59.333
their name on the opioid crisis

21:59.399 --> 22:01.368
they've fought so hard to

22:01.435 --> 22:03.303
distance themselves from.

22:03.370 --> 22:04.671
And that public accounting is

22:04.738 --> 22:08.609
starting to become possible

22:08.675 --> 22:09.977
despite the fact that

22:10.043 --> 22:10.544
Richard sackler has barely

22:10.611 --> 22:11.378
appeared in public.

22:11.445 --> 22:12.479
And there's actually a

22:12.546 --> 22:14.114
tantalizing development, because

22:14.181 --> 22:14.748
a few weeks ago, the transcript

22:14.815 --> 22:15.816
of a video deposition that

22:15.883 --> 22:16.817
Richard sackler gave in that

22:16.884 --> 22:18.485
Kentucky case ‐‐ the case,

22:18.552 --> 22:19.152
remember, where 17 million

22:19.219 --> 22:20.420
documents were destroyed ‐‐

22:20.487 --> 22:22.756
leaked to pro publica
and stat news.

22:22.823 --> 22:24.558
This is it right here.

22:24.625 --> 22:26.426
This is the thing purdue really

22:26.493 --> 22:30.731
didn't want anyone to see.

22:30.797 --> 22:32.699
And there is some
damning stuff in here.

22:32.766 --> 22:33.500
The really effective thing would

22:33.567 --> 22:34.701
be to see the video of this

22:34.768 --> 22:35.903
deposition, but purdue is

22:35.969 --> 22:37.604
fighting ferociously hard to

22:37.671 --> 22:39.640
keep it under seal,
which benefits them.

22:39.706 --> 22:41.141
As you've seen tonight,

22:41.208 --> 22:42.142
newscasters reading quotes will

22:42.209 --> 22:44.044
only get you so far.

22:44.111 --> 22:46.680
But we have the deposition, and

22:46.747 --> 22:47.714
you should know, Michael Keaton

22:47.781 --> 22:49.716
is not the only actor we got to

22:49.783 --> 22:51.418
play Richard sackler.

22:51.485 --> 22:52.953
In fact, we got multiple actors

22:53.020 --> 22:55.289
to read parts of sackler's

22:55.355 --> 22:59.459
deposition, word‐for‐word.

22:59.526 --> 23:00.227
And who better to convey the

23:00.294 --> 23:01.261
arrogance of an early exchange

23:01.328 --> 23:02.462
about sackler's involvement in

23:02.529 --> 23:03.263
purdue than someone responsible

23:03.330 --> 23:04.431
for playing one of the greatest

23:04.498 --> 23:08.168
drug dealers in
television history?

23:08.235 --> 23:10.604
On July 30th of 2014, were

23:10.671 --> 23:14.675
you a director of
purdue pharma inc?

23:14.741 --> 23:17.277
Not that I'm aware.

23:17.344 --> 23:18.312
This is an affidavit filed in

23:18.378 --> 23:21.248
the Southern district
of West Virginia.

23:21.315 --> 23:27.020
And does that appear
to be your name?

23:27.087 --> 23:29.356
That does.

23:29.423 --> 23:33.126
And it's dated July 30, 2014.

23:33.193 --> 23:34.895
It says "declaration of

23:34.962 --> 23:36.396
Dr. Richard s. Sackler.

23:36.463 --> 23:38.265
I am a director of

23:38.332 --> 23:39.466
purdue pharma inc, the general

23:39.533 --> 23:41.768
partner of purdue pharma llp.

23:41.835 --> 23:45.605
I've held this
position since 1990."

23:45.672 --> 23:46.740
If that's what it says, then

23:46.807 --> 23:49.276
that's what it says.

23:49.343 --> 23:50.477
Wow, Richard sackler

23:50.544 --> 23:53.413
came off like a real
dick there, right?

23:53.480 --> 23:54.548
Certainly more so than if I'd

23:54.614 --> 23:55.849
just read that to you.

23:55.916 --> 23:56.783
And since we had Bryan cranston,

23:56.850 --> 23:58.285
we didn't stop there.

23:58.352 --> 23:59.820
Because this deposition also

23:59.886 --> 24:01.688
contains an excerpt of a speech

24:01.755 --> 24:03.724
that sackler gave when oxycontin

24:03.790 --> 24:04.591
was launched, bragging about how

24:04.658 --> 24:07.194
quickly purdue got the
fda to approve it.

24:07.260 --> 24:08.328
So we had him go full

24:08.395 --> 24:12.632
Walter white on that one too.

24:12.699 --> 24:15.402
This didn't just happen.

24:15.469 --> 24:16.670
It was a deftly coordinated

24:16.737 --> 24:19.139
planned event that took dozens

24:19.206 --> 24:22.342
of workers years of
effort to succeed.

24:22.409 --> 24:23.877
The most demanding new drug

24:23.944 --> 24:25.912
approval package for any

24:25.979 --> 24:27.180
analgesic product ever submitted

24:27.247 --> 24:30.417
didn't languish at the agency.

24:30.484 --> 24:32.252
Unlike the years that other

24:32.319 --> 24:34.821
filings linger at fda, this

24:34.888 --> 24:40.527
product was approved
in 11 months, 14 days.

24:40.594 --> 24:42.396
Our previous best approval time

24:42.462 --> 24:44.398
for other products was measured

24:44.464 --> 24:52.039
in years, not months.

24:52.105 --> 24:55.409
God, I felt that
in my fucking bones.

24:55.475 --> 24:57.778
And, look, sure, we
could've stopped there.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.746
Those two actors are
already incredible.

24:59.813 --> 25:03.150
But then we remembered,
this is hbo.

25:03.216 --> 25:05.352
And if we want someone to read

25:05.419 --> 25:07.254
the shit out of another

25:07.320 --> 25:13.560
email that Richard
sackler wrote, this one

25:13.627 --> 25:21.301
characterizing his
devotion to oxycontin,

25:21.334 --> 25:22.669
we have access to the cast of

25:22.736 --> 25:23.503
another iconic drug drama.

25:23.570 --> 25:25.305
Brace yourselves, everyone.

25:25.372 --> 25:26.373
Omar comin'.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.407
You won't believe how

25:27.474 --> 25:28.175
committed I am to make oxycontin

25:28.241 --> 25:29.242
a huge success.

25:29.309 --> 25:30.310
It is almost that I've dedicated

25:30.377 --> 25:30.911
my life to it.

25:30.977 --> 25:32.012
Indeed.

25:32.079 --> 25:32.846
And, look, the only problem is,

25:32.913 --> 25:34.581
all of these actors
are pretty cool.

25:34.648 --> 25:36.783
And Richard sackler
decidedly is not.

25:36.850 --> 25:37.884
And so to embody the fact that

25:37.951 --> 25:39.419
he responded "I don't know" more

25:39.486 --> 25:40.187
than 100 times during his

25:40.253 --> 25:42.055
deposition, we asked

25:42.122 --> 25:43.090
Richard kind to read just a

25:43.156 --> 25:48.895
selection of them.

25:48.962 --> 25:52.132
How much money has purdue or

25:52.199 --> 25:52.566
purdue pharma made?

25:52.632 --> 25:55.802
I don't know.

25:55.869 --> 25:57.804
Do know how much the sackler

25:57.871 --> 25:59.405
family has made up a
sale of oxycontin?

25:59.438 --> 26:03.009
I don't know.

26:03.076 --> 26:04.611
Who is Lydia Johnson?

26:04.678 --> 26:05.345
I don't know.

26:05.378 --> 26:05.712
I don't know.

26:05.745 --> 26:06.413
I don't know.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.147
I don't know.

26:07.214 --> 26:10.650
I don't know.

26:10.717 --> 26:13.619
How many purdue
entities are there?

26:13.620 --> 26:15.422
I don't know!

26:15.489 --> 26:16.256
Pretty effective, huh?

26:16.323 --> 26:17.090
And Richard sackler might say,

26:17.157 --> 26:18.692
"I didn't sound like that," but

26:18.758 --> 26:19.559
we don't know that if we can't

26:19.626 --> 26:20.494
see the tape, which is why he

26:20.560 --> 26:22.963
should absolutely allow
it to be released.

26:23.029 --> 26:23.964
But if he doesn't, we can only

26:24.030 --> 26:25.232
imagine what was going on during

26:25.298 --> 26:26.566
his deposition.

26:26.633 --> 26:27.701
For instance, maybe he was

26:27.767 --> 26:28.902
sloppily eating a Turkey

26:28.969 --> 26:30.170
sandwich during this actual

26:30.237 --> 26:35.242
exchange about
oxycontin addiction.

26:35.308 --> 26:36.776
Have you made any effort, or

26:36.843 --> 26:37.577
as we sit here today, do you

26:37.644 --> 26:38.979
know how many patients who took

26:39.045 --> 26:40.113
oxycontin in Kentucky became

26:40.180 --> 26:43.083
dependent or addicted?

26:43.150 --> 26:44.484
No.

26:44.551 --> 26:46.453
Do you believe that an

26:46.520 --> 26:47.654
inappropriate number of patients

26:47.721 --> 26:48.588
or an excessive number of

26:48.655 --> 26:49.723
patients who took oxycontin in

26:49.789 --> 26:53.527
Kentucky became
addicted or dependent?

26:53.593 --> 26:55.262
No.

26:55.328 --> 26:56.429
Do you know or has purdue

26:56.496 --> 26:57.931
made any effort to ascertain how

26:57.998 --> 26:59.399
many people who were started on

26:59.466 --> 27:01.101
oxycontin wound up becoming

27:01.168 --> 27:02.702
dependent and moving on to

27:02.769 --> 27:05.071
heroin at some point?

27:05.138 --> 27:09.809
No.

27:09.876 --> 27:11.344
Why would he eat a

27:11.411 --> 27:14.181
sandwich during such a
serious deposition?

27:14.247 --> 27:15.749
I mean, yes, maybe he didn't,

27:15.815 --> 27:16.750
but it would be so easy for

27:16.816 --> 27:21.454
Richard sackler to
prove he didn't.

27:21.521 --> 27:22.589
The point is, until he does,

27:22.656 --> 27:25.392
we've uploaded videos of four

27:25.458 --> 27:26.693
different Richard sacklers

27:26.760 --> 27:28.028
reading extracts from his emails

27:28.094 --> 27:28.862
and deposition to

27:28.929 --> 27:30.363
sacklergallery.com, which I'm

27:30.430 --> 27:31.498
sure they'll enjoy.

27:31.565 --> 27:32.566
They love having their names on

27:32.632 --> 27:34.634
fucking galleries.

27:34.701 --> 27:35.936
We've also linked to various

27:36.002 --> 27:37.070
state lawsuits at the site so

27:37.137 --> 27:40.807
that you can read
them for yourself.

27:40.874 --> 27:42.175
The point here is,

27:42.242 --> 27:43.443
Richard sackler's deposition

27:43.510 --> 27:44.644
should not be something purdue

27:44.711 --> 27:46.012
gets to bury like it's buried so

27:46.079 --> 27:47.247
many other things
over the years.

27:47.314 --> 27:48.048
So please go to the website and

27:48.114 --> 27:50.050
watch and use the
clips as you see fit.

27:50.116 --> 27:51.284
So if Richard sackler wanted

27:51.351 --> 27:51.918
context, then guess what?

27:51.985 --> 27:55.922
This is it.

27:55.989 --> 27:56.823
It is a blizzard of context!

27:56.890 --> 27:58.725
Deep, dense, and white!

27:58.792 --> 28:00.994
You're welcome, sackler family!

28:01.061 --> 28:03.530
That's our show!

28:03.597 --> 28:04.464
Thanks so much for watching!

28:04.531 --> 28:05.498
See you next week!

28:05.565 --> 28:08.168
Good night!

28:25.252 --> 28:27.320
The launch of oxycontin

28:27.387 --> 28:29.689
tablets will be followed by a

28:29.756 --> 28:32.192
blizzard of prescriptions that

28:32.259 --> 28:33.526
will bury the competition!

28:33.593 --> 28:34.794
The prescription blizzard will

28:34.861 --> 28:35.862
be so deep, dense, and white!
