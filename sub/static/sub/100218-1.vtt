10:43.017 --> 10:45.019
Of course.
I wouldn't miss it.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.979
See you then. Love you.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.397
Love you too,
hi to mom.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.528
Hi.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.405
Surprise!

11:37.405 --> 11:39.365
I know I said I was busy
but I figured

11:39.365 --> 11:41.075
you might need a burger
right about now.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.326
Am I right?

11:42.326 --> 11:44.286
I totally forgot
to pick up dinner.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.496
Yeah, come in.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.793
I'll grab plates.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.343
How's it going?

12:00.928 --> 12:03.597
I have to come up with an idea
for a whole new toy line

12:03.597 --> 12:05.266
and learn everything
about Hanukkah,

12:05.266 --> 12:07.143
in the next week.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.103
Is there anything you need?

12:09.103 --> 12:10.771
It's gonna be a long night.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.440
Would you mind
getting me a coffee?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.567
Actually, I thought
you might say that.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.486
Which is why
I already got you one.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.281
It's black.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.782
Which is better for work

12:21.782 --> 12:24.618
as opposed to that Non-Fat
triple cinnamon thing you get.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.288
You're the best.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.081
No, no, no...

12:29.081 --> 12:31.083
Oh, come on! Foul!

12:32.293 --> 12:33.794
Are you watching
the game here?

12:33.794 --> 12:35.421
My cable's out, babe.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.631
I'll be out of your hair
as soon as it's over.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.300
I'm not in your way am I?

12:39.300 --> 12:42.595
Oh, no, not at all.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.389
Come on!

12:47.516 --> 12:48.976
Unbelievable.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.311
-Here.
-Thanks.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.396
I'm just gonna grab...

13:08.120 --> 13:09.997

hit the three...

13:19.882 --> 13:24.637
[alarm buzzes]

13:50.538 --> 13:53.207
[Christy] It's just a large
sugar free pumpkin spice latte

13:53.207 --> 13:55.709
with soy milk, no foam,
an extra espresso shot

13:55.709 --> 13:57.294
served at 120 degrees

13:57.294 --> 14:00.506
and filled three quarters
of the way up in this cup.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.759
With no whip cream
please, this time.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.512
You're definitely
getting whip cream.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.056
Excuse me?

14:09.056 --> 14:11.183
Oh, nothing, nothing...

14:13.477 --> 14:14.937
Probably extra whip cream.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.274
Are you insinuating
that my order

14:18.274 --> 14:19.733
warrants them
getting it wrong?

14:19.733 --> 14:21.735
I would never
insinuate that.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.737
So, what exactly
is wrong with my order?

14:23.737 --> 14:26.282
It's a little
complicated.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.908
They offer something
I like here

14:27.908 --> 14:29.326
and I want to enjoy it.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.869
In your own mug, no less.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.496
That's better
for the environment.

14:34.957 --> 14:38.794
You know, things worth doing
are worth doing right.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.921
I'm just saying, some of us
might be running late.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.591
Maybe allow more time to get
where you're going.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.094
My dad says "better to be
waiting than waited on."

14:47.094 --> 14:49.597
I like that.
I'll have to remember that one.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.769
Sugar free soy pumpkin,

14:55.769 --> 14:58.939
extra shot served at
exactly 120 degrees.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.817
Extra whip cream.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.777
Thank you so much.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.154
Keep the change.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.914
Hey, I'm at Happy Goat,
you would not believe today.

15:15.914 --> 15:18.208
Anyway, I'm excited to
meet Alex's teacher.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.543
See you soon.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.589
Oh, I didn't
order a muffin.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.883
This isn't just
any muffin.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.427
This is an apology muffin.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.596
Are apology muffins
any good?

15:30.596 --> 15:32.973
They're delicious.
They have to be.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.476
Listen, before, I was...

15:35.476 --> 15:37.311
Insanely rude!

15:37.311 --> 15:39.271
Yeah, and I'm sorry.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.982
I like that you have
a mug for the environment.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.110
Apology muffin accepted.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.948
And...

15:49.948 --> 15:51.992
Are you waiting for
me to apologize?

15:51.992 --> 15:53.327
That's how an apology
muffin works.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.953
You can't just make up
muffin rules.

15:54.953 --> 15:56.330
It took two of us to be
rude in that run in.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.706
You were way more rude.

15:57.706 --> 15:58.874
You're both here!

15:58.874 --> 16:00.250
Hey Samantha?

16:00.250 --> 16:03.003
You already met. Great!
Let's get started.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.005
We are definitely
not getting started.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.715
More like we're finished here.
Nice to see you.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.634
Wait, what's happening?

16:09.677 --> 16:11.261
Stop!

16:11.261 --> 16:15.015
Christy, you have eight days
to get your act together

16:15.015 --> 16:17.643
and Jonathan here
is an amazing teacher.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.269
See? Some people
think I'm amazing.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.896
And you!

16:20.896 --> 16:22.856
You told me at post parent
teacher conference drinks

16:22.856 --> 16:25.526
that your girlfriend's family
is flying in for Christmas,

16:25.526 --> 16:27.653
and how much do you know
about Christmas?

16:27.653 --> 16:29.613
How much?

16:29.613 --> 16:31.615
Nothing.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.158
Nothing!

16:33.158 --> 16:35.536
Christy, do you think
you can help with that?

16:35.536 --> 16:38.372
What's a post parent-teacher
conference drinks?

16:38.372 --> 16:41.792
The only way parents and
teachers actually

16:41.792 --> 16:43.085
get to know each other.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.670
Now, did you hear
what he just said?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.839
Yeah, and I still don't think I
can learn a thing from this man.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.424
She's incorrigible!

16:48.424 --> 16:51.635
[musical ringtone]

16:52.553 --> 16:53.929
Hey.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.348
No I'm just finishing up.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.393
A wreath? Sure.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.395
What was the other thing?

17:01.395 --> 17:02.980
Fruitcake?

17:02.980 --> 17:05.315
No problem.
Will pick both up.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.029
You don't know what
a fruitcake is, do you?

17:11.029 --> 17:13.240
Of course I know
what a fruitcake is!

17:13.240 --> 17:16.410
I just didn't think
people actually eat them.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.411
[laughs]

17:17.411 --> 17:18.746
What gave you that idea?

17:18.746 --> 17:20.873
Every Christmas episode
of every TV show, ever.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.624
Well they're delicious,
but only if you know

17:22.624 --> 17:24.209
where to get them.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.044
Do you?

17:26.044 --> 17:28.297
Well Christy does.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.425
She can teach you about
fruitcake, gingerbread houses

17:31.425 --> 17:33.302
and adorable
ugly-sweaters.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.096
And Christy, Jonathan
can teach you about...

17:36.096 --> 17:37.890
I don't know.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.183
Chicken soup, maybe?

17:39.183 --> 17:40.851
Is that a Hanukkah thing?

17:42.728 --> 17:44.813
You really know a place where
I can get a good fruitcake?

17:44.813 --> 17:46.231
I know three.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.816
And a nice wreath joint.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.777
There's different
types of wreaths?

17:49.777 --> 17:53.614
You don't need
soup for Hanukkah

17:53.614 --> 17:55.407
but you do need
potato latkes

17:55.407 --> 17:57.284
and it's best
if they're homemade.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.289
Alright, what if,
and this is a big what if,

18:02.289 --> 18:05.793
we put our
differences aside...

18:05.793 --> 18:07.503
Just for the time being.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.546
For the time being, exactly.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.965
Long enough...

18:11.965 --> 18:13.592
To help each other out.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.520
Apology muffin accepted.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.158
I should get back to the office,
you got this.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.872
So when's the big
client dinner?

18:43.872 --> 18:46.041
Christmas Eve, ironically.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.168
Which is also
the last night of Hanukkah.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.670
Eight days from now.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.588
Sorta funny, huh?

18:51.588 --> 18:53.757
Is it? How come?

18:53.757 --> 18:57.803
Eight days of Hanukkah?
Nothing?

18:59.137 --> 19:01.682
Now I see why Samantha
called me,

19:01.682 --> 19:03.684
should we get
started right away?

19:03.684 --> 19:07.521
Sure, is there
a Hanukkah thing we can do now?

19:07.521 --> 19:09.064
Let's see, we can't
light the menorah

19:09.064 --> 19:11.233
until after sundown...

19:11.233 --> 19:13.235
That's it!
Let's get you a menorah.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.237
Great! That's like...

19:15.237 --> 19:16.738
a candle holder, right?

19:16.738 --> 19:19.575
We really have a lot
of work ahead of us.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.909
Come on.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.123
[Christy]
Okay, let me get this straight.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.876
So every night
you light one more candle.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.545
And you always
use the middle one

19:31.545 --> 19:32.754
to light the others?

19:32.754 --> 19:34.256
The shamash.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.717
That's how you say it.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.887
OK, so tonight,
the first night,

19:39.887 --> 19:43.724
you would have the candle
on the right and the...

19:43.724 --> 19:45.559
"Sh-mash" in the middle.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.436
Look at you,
you're a natural.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.688
This is it.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.232
What is this?

19:52.232 --> 19:54.610
A good place to start...

19:55.944 --> 19:57.321
After you.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.723
It's beautiful.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.685
Jewish traditions
go back 6000 years.

20:30.103 --> 20:33.440
No, you see, that's backwards.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.610
You read Hebrew
from right-to-left.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.611
Here, let me show you.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.780
I was hoping
you were here.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.449
Of course I'm here,
where else would I be?

20:44.117 --> 20:46.161
Savta, we need a menorah.
Can you help us?

20:46.161 --> 20:47.788
You know where they are.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.289
Thank you,
I'll be right back.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.461
So much tradition.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.796
It's wonderful.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.799
The story of the Jewish people
is a long one.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.969
Seems like it's all about
family and community.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.638
These things are important.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.223
The most important.

21:07.808 --> 21:08.976
Found the perfect one.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.190
You never
introduce, Yonny.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.692
Sorry, savta.

21:16.692 --> 21:20.028
This is Christy.
Christy this is Tovah.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.071
Shaloam.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.448
I'm sorry,
is it Tovah or savta?

21:23.448 --> 21:26.493
Oh, ha, no --
Tovah is her name.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.537
Savta is what she is.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.664
It means grandmother.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.582
How much for the menorah?

21:32.582 --> 21:34.626
Oh, let me see...

21:34.626 --> 21:35.961
Another kiss.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.172
Thank you.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.549
So, tell me, this one.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.883
She's the new girlfriend?

21:41.883 --> 21:43.385
No, savta.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.387
She's a... student.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.596
Ah.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.765
So, how long did
they hold you back?

21:51.768 --> 21:53.770
Is that Jonathan
in those pictures?

21:53.770 --> 21:55.022
Oh yeah.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.566
[all talking over each other]

21:57.566 --> 21:59.234
Shh!

22:00.569 --> 22:04.156
He's been to Egypt,
he's been to China...

22:04.156 --> 22:05.991
[Christy]
You've been all over.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.994
Every year, new adventure.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.746
I believe you need
to see things

22:10.746 --> 22:12.581
outside of your
own perspective

22:12.581 --> 22:14.374
to truly
understand the world.

22:14.374 --> 22:17.377
You may like it, you may
hate it, but at least...

22:17.377 --> 22:18.837
You know for yourself.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.130
That's right.

22:22.215 --> 22:24.051
My yonny's impressive, huh?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.261
Thank you, okay.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.721
We're done here.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.556
Let's start learning
about Hanukkah

22:29.556 --> 22:31.558
with your new Menorah.

22:31.558 --> 22:35.062
What? You start learning
with the menorah?

22:35.062 --> 22:36.938
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

22:36.938 --> 22:39.149
Personally, I would
start with latkes.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.652
You learn better
on full stomach.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.571
She's not wrong.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.948
She never is.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.159
You don't have time
for lunch, do you?

22:51.620 --> 22:53.121
I had lunch plans
with Heather,

22:53.121 --> 22:54.790
I hope you don't mind
if she joins us.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.249
Not at all.

22:56.249 --> 22:58.919
I'll get a sense of what
she expects for Christmas Eve.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.713
So your boyfriend doesn't mind
spending Christmas Eve

23:01.713 --> 23:03.090
at a work event?

23:03.090 --> 23:04.591
Heather would kill me.

23:04.591 --> 23:07.844
Peter's not much
for the holidays.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.972
-Surprised?
-A little bit.

23:12.265 --> 23:13.892
To be honest, me too,

23:13.892 --> 23:16.561
but we can't help
who we fall for.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.565
Look at me, I never expected to
be planning a winter wonderland

23:20.565 --> 23:21.942
in my apartment,

23:21.942 --> 23:23.985
but if Heather's dad
doesn't like me it's over.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.862
Cool, so no pressure.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.114
Yeah, none at all.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.201
Did you always
want to teach?

23:31.201 --> 23:32.452
No ma'am.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.788
I was going to
be an adventurous archaeologist.

23:34.788 --> 23:35.956
Because...

23:35.956 --> 23:37.624
Indiana Jones.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.000
That's right.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.503
No one told me there'd be
a decade of student loans

23:41.503 --> 23:43.380
before one treasure hunt

23:43.380 --> 23:45.465
so like our friend, Indie,

23:45.465 --> 23:47.008
I took a part-time
gig teaching.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.301
Turns out, I love it.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.137
You found your passion.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.221
I can relate.

23:53.348 --> 23:55.809
Hello, hello...
Am I late?

23:55.809 --> 23:57.561
It was hard to find.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.229
-Hey, no.
-Hi.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.148
Heather, Christy,
Christy, Heather.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.941
Girlfriend extraordinaire.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.485
You must be Jonathan's new
Hanukkah student.

24:05.485 --> 24:07.946
Part time student,
part time teacher,

24:07.946 --> 24:09.614
full time hungry.

24:09.614 --> 24:10.949
You're a teacher as well?

24:10.949 --> 24:13.160
We ordered those
potato pancakes

24:13.160 --> 24:14.828
and jelly doughnuts
I told you about.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.997
I know, crazy lunch,
but it's all for the lessons.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.874
Isn't Hanukkah random?

24:18.874 --> 24:20.500
I know, right?

24:20.500 --> 24:22.002
Like, why eight days?

24:22.002 --> 24:23.670
Why not cap it at a week?

24:23.670 --> 24:27.174
Well, there's
a miracle involved.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.884
Listening.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.678
[Jonathan]
So 2200 years ago

24:31.678 --> 24:34.055
a small Hebrew army

24:34.055 --> 24:37.559
fought back to drive their
GrecoSyrian invaders

24:37.559 --> 24:39.060
out of Israel,

24:39.060 --> 24:41.062
but upon their return
they discovered

24:41.062 --> 24:43.690
their holiest temple
has been desecrated!

24:43.690 --> 24:45.483
That's intense.

24:45.483 --> 24:46.693
Very intense.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.904
Time was running out
to restore the temple,

24:48.904 --> 24:52.532
and the Maccabees, the family
in charge of the rebellion,

24:52.532 --> 24:55.869
only had enough oil
to light one lamp.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.871
There's a miracle
a-coming.

24:57.871 --> 25:00.874
The oil, which was only
enough for one night mind you,

25:00.874 --> 25:04.044
miraculously
lasted for...

25:04.044 --> 25:05.879
Eight nights!

25:05.879 --> 25:07.130
That's right.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.715
The Maccabees were
able to finish

25:08.715 --> 25:11.384
restoring their holy temple.

25:11.384 --> 25:14.095
In honor of this miracle,
we light the menorah

25:14.095 --> 25:15.722
for eight nights

25:15.722 --> 25:19.184
and display the flames
for the world to see.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.062
That's why Hanukkah is called
the Festival of Light.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.772
That's a pretty
cool story.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.734
OK, so these are
the Latkes

25:27.734 --> 25:29.486
and those are the sofganyot.

25:29.486 --> 25:33.031
I'm gonna dig right in.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.748
That is like a Jelly Doughnut on
performing enhancing steroids.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.625
The secret
ingredient is love.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.627
The secret
ingredient is sugar.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.879
That too...

25:52.467 --> 25:53.802
Wait!

25:53.802 --> 25:55.595
Try it with sour cream.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.931
[Christy]
Really? That's very random.

25:57.931 --> 25:59.891
Not random, it's traditional.

25:59.891 --> 26:02.310
But, if you don't want
to be traditional...

26:02.310 --> 26:03.770
No, no! I'll do it.

26:08.441 --> 26:10.151
Pretty good right?

26:10.151 --> 26:11.528
Amazing!

26:13.613 --> 26:15.282
Oh, sorry.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.117
You know what?
I've got to take this.

26:17.117 --> 26:20.370
Hello? Hi.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.917
You didn't tell her about
the Christmas lessons, did you?

26:25.917 --> 26:28.295
Of course not,
I want it to be a surprise.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.505
What if it
doesn't work out?

26:30.505 --> 26:33.591
What if I'm just
bad at Christmas?

26:33.591 --> 26:35.468
Of course it's
going to work out.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.595
I, too, am an
excellent teacher.

26:37.595 --> 26:41.016
Tomorrow we switch gears,
focus on my favorite thing

26:41.016 --> 26:42.642
in the world bar none.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.311
Christmas.

26:44.311 --> 26:47.731
Though sour cream and latkes
are creeping up on that list.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.816
Can you meet me at
Tinsel Town after work?

26:49.816 --> 26:51.359
Perfect. Yes.
Totally.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.028
One question...

26:53.028 --> 26:54.696
What's a Tinsel Town?

26:54.696 --> 26:58.575
[alarm goes off]

27:22.766 --> 27:25.685
It's OK, everything is OK.

27:25.685 --> 27:27.687
Things are never OK when you
start a sentence like that.

27:27.687 --> 27:31.358
Pat just heard David invited
Toys & Tricks to his party.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.777
Toys & Tricks? Why?
They're the worst!

27:33.777 --> 27:35.695
The board loved the idea of
having a new line of toys

27:35.695 --> 27:37.947
pitched so much that
now they want options.

27:37.947 --> 27:39.240
Ugh!

27:39.240 --> 27:42.702
So, it's a competition
and I still have nothing.

27:42.702 --> 27:45.413
You are the best at this
and I say that knowing full well

27:45.413 --> 27:47.665

28:10.897 --> 28:13.733
We did say six, right?

28:13.733 --> 28:16.903
I kind of figured
you'd be late.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.989
Better to be waiting
than waited on, right

28:19.989 --> 28:22.575
You remembered?

28:22.575 --> 28:24.369
Yeah,

29:36.608 --> 29:38.818
it's a few

for effort for sure!

35:07.313 --> 35:10.316
Oh man, really? That bad?

35:10.316 --> 35:12.443
No, no, it's
actually pretty good.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.195
You'll get better.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.364
So I know tomorrow
is Saturday

35:16.364 --> 35:17.990
but are you around to meet
me for our next lesson?

35:17.990 --> 35:19.992
Text me
the address and time.

35:19.992 --> 35:21.160
Great.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.995
Remember how
we say goodbye?

35:22.995 --> 35:26.833
Chag Sameach.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.793
Really close.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.671
A little more hah.

35:31.671 --> 35:32.922
Chag Sameach.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.382
Like you have a little phlegm
in your throat.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.509
Chag Sameach.

35:36.509 --> 35:37.718
Perfect.

35:37.718 --> 35:39.220
And Merry Christmas
to you too.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.763

Alright, one, two?

36:10.376 --> 36:12.336
We've got a two
for one deal, yes?

36:12.336 --> 36:14.172
Did you tell them about that?

36:14.172 --> 36:17.550
Right, for you sir.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.637
Not quite what you were
expecting, huh?

36:21.637 --> 36:23.097
What are you doing?

36:23.097 --> 36:25.391
It was your idea, sort of.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.727
Every year I do
a fundraiser for my class.

36:27.727 --> 36:31.814
You made me realize
people are desperate

36:31.814 --> 36:32.940
for good fruitcake.

36:32.940 --> 36:35.568
Then showed me this place.
It's perfect.

36:35.568 --> 36:39.780
I love it so, don't take
this the wrong way but;

36:39.780 --> 36:41.657
what does this have
to do with Hanukkah?

36:41.657 --> 36:44.535
A large part of
Judaism is community.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.370
Holidays are not
just for celebrating

36:46.370 --> 36:47.830
but for giving back.

36:47.830 --> 36:49.916
I wanted to show
you how we...

36:52.084 --> 36:53.502
I mean, you don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.296
No, no, no.
It's on my list!

36:55.296 --> 36:56.881
Spirit of giving.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.467
I guess it can count
for both of us.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.428
How can I help?

37:02.428 --> 37:04.889
We could use your
business skills,

37:04.889 --> 37:06.933
your business acumen.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.060
Guys, this is Christy.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.604
She's a professional,
so we're in good hands here.

37:11.604 --> 37:12.813
-I mean...
-Right?

37:19.278 --> 37:21.739
Hey Alex, your mom
said you'd be here.

37:21.739 --> 37:24.283
Do I get a discount because
I'm in Mr. Silver's class?

37:24.283 --> 37:26.452
Oh, you are?
That'll be three fifty.

37:26.452 --> 37:28.079
You're tougher than
Mr. Silver.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.205
Is he tough?

37:29.205 --> 37:30.748
He's like, the right
amount of tough.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.959
He says "you learn by
doing for yourself,".

37:32.959 --> 37:34.460
He's kind of right,
isn't he?

37:34.460 --> 37:35.795
He's fun.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.797
You tell anyone
I gave this to you

37:37.797 --> 37:39.215
and there's
going to be trouble.

How do they have
all that energy?

Natural sugar!

37:47.139 --> 37:50.476
Oh no, you've been dipping
into your own supply.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.105
Thank you
for coming out today.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.148
I should get home
and wrap some gifts.

37:56.148 --> 37:57.483
That's on my list too!

37:57.483 --> 37:59.235
Do you know how
to wrap them properly?

37:59.235 --> 38:00.486
Properly?
What are you saying?

38:00.486 --> 38:02.029
There's a proper way
to wrap gifts?

38:03.364 --> 38:04.573
Here, have this.

38:04.573 --> 38:05.783
Then come to my place where
I can show you

38:05.783 --> 38:06.993
how to wrap like a pro.

38:10.663 --> 38:12.331
Great.
That'll be $3.50.

38:12.331 --> 38:15.167
It's for a really
good cause.

38:17.920 --> 38:18.337
OK, OK,

38:24.844 --> 38:27.847
OK this way...

38:29.640 --> 38:32.018
You get eight gifts
for each person?

38:32.018 --> 38:34.061
A gift per night.

38:34.061 --> 38:35.938
It sounds like a lot but
they're mostly small

38:35.938 --> 38:37.315
and then one
or two big ones.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.526
You have no idea how many pairs
of socks I had as a kid.

38:40.526 --> 38:42.486
This is so exciting.

38:42.486 --> 38:46.032
Wrapping is an art form
and I am like Monet.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.076
I have a kit.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.548
Is this what my place is going
to look like when we're done?

39:02.548 --> 39:04.133
That is the plan.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.510
You ready?

39:06.510 --> 39:08.512
Oh wow, you weren't kidding.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.473
Let's do this.

39:11.807 --> 39:13.017
[Christy]
Dragons?

39:13.017 --> 39:15.686
-Nice.
-Right?

39:15.686 --> 39:17.563
This is so cute.

39:22.693 --> 39:26.572
The best idea I have so far
is "Stockbroker Action Figures."

39:26.572 --> 39:29.700
Do they fight
tax crime or something?

39:29.700 --> 39:31.869
I know.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.705
Oh, no you have to make it
a little more even.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.082
Even okay.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.833
A lot of it is caring.

39:37.833 --> 39:40.544
If you care enough to put
the effort in, it shows.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.880
You want to know what
makes the perfect gift?

39:42.880 --> 39:44.548
Listening.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.342
If you listen
hard enough,

39:46.342 --> 39:48.219
people will tell
you what they want.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.514
That's how I try to deal
with my students, actually.

39:51.514 --> 39:54.266
You're wonderful
with your students.

39:54.266 --> 39:57.353
I hope I can relate to my
kids... you know, eventually.

39:57.353 --> 40:00.022
So you're thinking about
having kids?

40:00.022 --> 40:02.900
Yeah, I mean, we're not
there yet but...

40:02.900 --> 40:04.610
one day, hopefully.

40:04.610 --> 40:06.445
I get kids.

40:06.445 --> 40:09.281
We're kindred spirits.

40:09.281 --> 40:11.283
That's why I love
working with them.

40:11.283 --> 40:13.452
Just don't tell Heather.

40:13.452 --> 40:15.287
"Don't tell Heather?"

40:15.287 --> 40:16.622
You know how it is.

40:16.622 --> 40:19.041

you make adjustments.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.459

Everything okay?

40:43.816 --> 40:45.317

40:45.317 --> 40:46.527
He heard Toys & Tricks have
something up their sleeve

40:46.527 --> 40:48.279
and wanted me to do
some digging around.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.989
Can you come in?

40:49.989 --> 40:51.657
-Of course.

No, no, I know.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.503
Okay.

41:16.432 --> 41:19.018
You know that Stockbroker
thing you mentioned?

41:19.018 --> 41:21.645
What if it came with, like,
a comic book that taught kids

41:21.645 --> 41:24.023
lessons about
economics and stuff?

41:24.023 --> 41:25.858
There might be
something there.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.328
Good, everyone is here.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.662

Well let's hear it
because rumor has it

have something great.

I was thinking the best
toys make learning fun.

41:50.507 --> 41:53.052
Maybe there's a way to
make our most inspiring

41:53.052 --> 41:56.096

into action figures?

41:58.057 --> 42:00.351

there yet...

It's perfect. Do it!

It's just a seed.

a winner to me.

executive decision.

42:09.693 --> 42:12.321
Take tomorrow off, but get
a prototype together for Monday.

give me Sunday off?

42:24.583 --> 42:26.835
Between us,
the pitch isn't there yet,

42:26.835 --> 42:28.379
but focus on
the comic book aspect.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.256
That's a real selling
point in this market.

42:30.256 --> 42:32.299

jumping into sales?

Half the things
Pat knows come from you.

be a spot open...

Let's worry first about
getting you promoted.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.856

let's both get out of here.

Fine. I get it.

Think bigger!

44:48.018 --> 44:49.728
Can I ask you
something random?

Why do you think my friend
won't apply to a job

44:52.731 --> 44:55.150
she'd be amazing at?

44:55.150 --> 44:56.860
Is this Samantha?

44:56.860 --> 44:59.988
Let's call her... "Pamantha."

45:01.490 --> 45:04.243
Well I don't know
about... Pamantha,

45:04.243 --> 45:06.912
but if one of my students
isn't applying themselves

45:06.912 --> 45:08.831
it's usually
insecurity.

45:08.831 --> 45:11.834
Like if they don't try
they won't fail, you know?

45:11.834 --> 45:15.295
But if they don't try
they won't succeed either!

45:15.295 --> 45:16.422
Exactly.

45:16.422 --> 45:18.257
That's the lesson
I try to teach them.

your own, you know that, right?

trusts your instincts.

their lead and trust them too.

to trust mine!

46:49.014 --> 46:50.724
but we can get started.

46:50.724 --> 46:52.434
Hope you don't mind I asked
Peter to pick me up here

46:52.434 --> 46:53.519
to buy some time.

46:53.519 --> 46:55.604
Yeah, sure.

46:56.772 --> 46:58.148
What do you think?

46:58.148 --> 47:00.108
Can we turn this place
into a Christmas wonderland?

47:00.108 --> 47:03.028
It's gonna take
some work, but yes!

47:07.533 --> 47:09.910
Okay, so a lot of work.

47:09.910 --> 47:12.037
-Which way is the...
-No, uh no.

47:12.037 --> 47:14.289
Let's not with this, no.

47:14.289 --> 47:16.875
Jonathan.

47:21.713 --> 47:24.466
So I got a phone call
and I showed up

47:24.466 --> 47:25.551
and the cops were there.

47:25.551 --> 47:28.804
It became
an international incident.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.389
Stop it! They did not!

47:30.389 --> 47:33.225
The moral of the story is never
trust a bunch of 13 year-olds

47:33.225 --> 47:36.228
pick a spot
for lunch in Morocco.

47:36.228 --> 47:38.230
[both laugh]

47:38.230 --> 47:40.315
Peter will be
here any minute.

47:40.315 --> 47:42.109
Then, before it's too late...

47:53.412 --> 47:55.956
You learn by doing
for yourself.

48:15.684 --> 48:17.936
Ba-ruch A-tah Ado-nai

48:37.164 --> 48:39.124
Great.

48:39.124 --> 48:40.751
[knock on the door]

48:40.751 --> 48:42.753
Do you mind if I freshen up?

48:42.753 --> 48:44.755
Yeah of course,
up the stairs on the right.

48:44.755 --> 48:45.881
Thank you.

48:49.301 --> 48:50.594
Hey, you must be Peter.

48:50.594 --> 48:51.803
So they tell me.

48:51.803 --> 48:55.098
Jonathan.
Christy is just freshening up.

48:55.098 --> 48:57.100
Do you want a drink or anything?

48:57.100 --> 48:58.644
I'm great, thanks.

48:58.644 --> 49:00.312
Wow.

49:00.312 --> 49:01.980
Why didn't you
buy the big one?

49:03.649 --> 49:05.901
You couldn't pay me to get
that thing into my place.

49:05.901 --> 49:07.653
Can't stand the mess.

49:09.112 --> 49:11.990
Nice apartment, though.

49:11.990 --> 49:13.408
What do you do Johnny?

49:13.408 --> 49:14.951
High school teacher.

49:14.951 --> 49:17.788
Wow, that's great.

49:17.788 --> 49:21.166
I'm in stocks myself. For now.

49:21.166 --> 49:22.668
Christy and I,
we got big plans.

49:22.668 --> 49:24.002
In fact, once she
lands this promotion

49:24.002 --> 49:25.170
I've set her up
to leverage it.

49:25.170 --> 49:27.130
Leverage it?

49:27.130 --> 49:29.508
It's a bit of a surprise,

49:29.508 --> 49:32.094
but I got her an interview
at National Bank.

49:32.094 --> 49:34.346
With the new title
she'll get it for sure.

49:34.346 --> 49:36.014
Does Christy want to
be a banker?

49:36.014 --> 49:37.599
Wants to?

49:37.599 --> 49:39.851
It's a 20%
pay-bump.

49:39.851 --> 49:42.145
I thought Christy loved
working with toys.

49:42.145 --> 49:44.940
Who actually loves
what they do, right?

49:46.566 --> 49:47.609
I do.

49:49.653 --> 49:51.113
Great, great.

49:51.113 --> 49:53.031
Hey, thanks for waiting.

49:53.031 --> 49:54.074
Ready to go?

49:54.074 --> 49:55.534
Sure am.

49:55.534 --> 49:57.035
Nice to meet you Johnny.

49:57.035 --> 49:58.286
Petey...

49:59.579 --> 50:00.706
Oh, my jacket.

50:00.706 --> 50:02.457
I'll pull
the car around.

50:06.795 --> 50:08.380
Hey, wait.

50:08.380 --> 50:10.090
Peter was saying
something that...

50:12.884 --> 50:14.386
Never mind.

50:14.386 --> 50:15.554
Enjoy your dinner.

50:15.554 --> 50:17.139
What were you gonna say?

50:18.557 --> 50:19.766
It's none of my business,

50:19.766 --> 50:22.853
but you and Peter
may be on different pages.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.354
What does that mean?

50:24.354 --> 50:25.647
I don't know, I thought
you were passionate

50:25.647 --> 50:28.817
about your work,
not money or titles.

50:29.818 --> 50:30.902
I am.

50:30.902 --> 50:32.612
Then you shouldn't
settle for less..

50:32.612 --> 50:35.407
What about you?

50:35.407 --> 50:38.910
You've all but given up
on having your own kids.

50:38.910 --> 50:40.829
-That's different.
-Is it?

50:43.373 --> 50:45.917
We're talking about you.

50:45.917 --> 50:48.086
The same person
who orders coffee

50:48.086 --> 50:49.546
right down
to the temperature

50:49.546 --> 50:51.923
should fight for what she
wants in her relationship.

50:51.923 --> 50:53.884
You're right.

50:53.884 --> 50:56.303
This is none
of your business.

51:06.605 --> 51:08.106
Why did I say that?

51:09.775 --> 51:11.818
I'm talking to a tree...

51:20.410 --> 51:22.412
You think they'll get mad
if I just want meat?

51:22.412 --> 51:23.872
I'm trying to stick
to my keto diet.

51:28.835 --> 51:31.129
Babe, you okay?

51:31.129 --> 51:33.507
What? Oh yes.

51:33.507 --> 51:36.134
Keto. Sounds delicious.

51:37.427 --> 51:39.137
I get it.

51:39.137 --> 51:40.597
You're thinking
about work.

51:40.597 --> 51:42.349
I'm sure your
idea is great.

51:42.349 --> 51:45.060
Yeah.

51:46.978 --> 51:48.980
OK, I was going to surprise
you with this a little later

51:48.980 --> 51:51.191
but seeing as how you
need a pick me up...

51:52.317 --> 51:54.653
Peter this is not
the right time for...

51:54.653 --> 51:56.655
Paperwork?

52:00.116 --> 52:01.910
It's National
Bank's application.

52:01.910 --> 52:03.620
For an interview
I set up.

52:03.620 --> 52:05.288
Interview?

52:05.288 --> 52:07.749
I had to pull a few strings
but, it was worth it.

52:07.749 --> 52:10.502
Of course it's contingent
on a higher role so,

52:10.502 --> 52:12.170
you have to land
that promotion.

52:13.338 --> 52:15.507
These are the future plans
you wanted to talk about.

52:15.507 --> 52:16.967
Exciting, right?

52:16.967 --> 52:18.844
It's not what imagined, Peter...

52:18.844 --> 52:20.345
Like I was telling Johnny,

52:20.345 --> 52:22.013
a couple of years
at the bank and then...

52:22.013 --> 52:23.431
We are gold.

52:23.431 --> 52:24.724
You talked to
Jonathan about this?

52:24.724 --> 52:26.726
But boy did he not get it.

52:26.726 --> 52:28.186
[laughs]

52:28.186 --> 52:30.730
Some people just completely
miss the point, you know?

52:30.730 --> 52:33.859
Yeah, I guess
some people do.

52:35.527 --> 52:37.028

53:03.179 --> 53:05.307
That's your gameface,
"I got this" look?

53:09.561 --> 53:11.229
It's very rough.

53:11.229 --> 53:12.564
I see that.

53:12.564 --> 53:14.774
We can release it
with this comic.

53:15.984 --> 53:19.654
It's educational
and, you know, fun.

53:19.654 --> 53:21.281
That's a great idea.

53:21.281 --> 53:23.366
-It's missing something.
-You'll get there.

53:23.366 --> 53:24.701
What are you
basing that on?

53:24.701 --> 53:26.870
You. I am basing that on you.

53:26.870 --> 53:28.204
If any one can do this...

53:28.204 --> 53:29.497
It's you.

53:30.665 --> 53:32.000
Hold me.

54:29.140 --> 54:31.810
OK, you can do this.

[Jingle Bells ringtone]

55:13.685 --> 55:14.978
Hey dad, what's up?

55:14.978 --> 55:17.522
Merry pre
Pre-Christmas eve-eve!

55:17.522 --> 55:20.859
I'm super excited too, but...

55:20.859 --> 55:22.610
Oh, I don't like "buts."

55:22.610 --> 55:24.029
Peter can't make it.

55:24.029 --> 55:25.864
Working out
or a game's on?

55:25.864 --> 55:28.158
Probably both.

55:28.158 --> 55:30.785
We'll set up a spot
just in case he frees up.

55:30.785 --> 55:32.203
Everything OK otherwise?

55:32.203 --> 55:33.329
Not really.

55:33.329 --> 55:35.373
Things are... tough.

55:35.373 --> 55:37.042
I'm sorry to hear
that sweetheart.

55:37.042 --> 55:39.002
I know you're going
to get through it.

55:39.002 --> 55:41.838
Everyone keeps saying that,
how do you all know?

55:41.838 --> 55:43.715
[Dad]
Because we have faith in you

55:43.715 --> 55:45.675
even when you don't
have faith in yourself.

55:45.675 --> 55:47.552
You'll find it
soon enough.

55:47.552 --> 55:49.262
What do I do until then?

55:50.597 --> 55:53.224
Get yourself some coffee?

55:54.559 --> 55:57.562
That's a pretty good idea, Dad.
Thank you.

55:59.230 --> 56:00.732
I'll talk to
you later, bye.

56:15.246 --> 56:16.873
I know you.

amazing everything's are going.

56:22.337 --> 56:24.464
Well he's
a wonderful teacher.

56:24.464 --> 56:27.092
I mean his students,
they must just love him, right?

56:27.092 --> 56:28.676
Everyone loves him.

56:28.676 --> 56:30.512
Well, maybe everyone.

56:30.512 --> 56:32.430
He's supposed to be
meeting my dad this week.

56:32.430 --> 56:33.765
That's gonna
be a tough one.

56:33.765 --> 56:35.683
You kidding?
You have nothing to worry about.

56:35.683 --> 56:36.810
Jonathan's amazing!

56:36.810 --> 56:38.269
Yeah he is...

56:38.269 --> 56:39.604
You said it yourself.

56:39.604 --> 56:40.980
Who doesn't love him, right?

56:40.980 --> 56:43.274
Yeah, no one.

Ice green tea with
almond milk for Heather.

56:50.782 --> 56:52.617
It was nice to bump into you.

thinking to do, so...

You got it right!

57:07.423 --> 57:09.134
Sorry about before.

57:09.134 --> 57:11.136
It was my first week
and I kept messing up.

57:11.136 --> 57:12.512
No, it's okay.

57:12.512 --> 57:14.973
I kind thought you were
getting it wrong on purpose.

57:14.973 --> 57:16.182
Why?

57:16.182 --> 57:17.559
[Christy] It was an annoying
order, I know...

57:17.559 --> 57:19.102
No way!

57:19.102 --> 57:21.229
There's nothing wrong with
getting exactly what you want.

it's Christy, Jonathan's...

What do I know?

57:41.124 --> 57:43.835
Are you alright sweetheart?
Is everything OK?

57:43.835 --> 57:47.463
I need to buy something
special for someone

57:47.463 --> 57:49.299
to say "I'm sorry."

57:49.299 --> 57:51.843
And do I know
this someone?

57:51.843 --> 57:53.845
You might.

57:53.845 --> 57:56.431
Is he the one that
should be apologizing?

57:56.431 --> 57:58.183
I should be
the one to go first.

57:58.183 --> 58:00.727
Do you have any idea
of what I can get him?

58:02.312 --> 58:03.730
I think I can help.

58:03.730 --> 58:05.857
Come on.

58:27.086 --> 58:28.296
Come in.

58:32.050 --> 58:34.219
I should never
have said anything.

58:34.219 --> 58:36.221
Who am I to give
anyone advice on...

58:36.221 --> 58:37.889
Please, just open this.

58:48.566 --> 58:51.236
I had one just like it
in my room when I was a kid.

58:51.236 --> 58:53.071
That's why your
grandmother thought

58:53.071 --> 58:54.739
it would make
such a great gift.

58:56.032 --> 58:57.825
You shouldn't have
after what I said.

58:57.825 --> 59:01.371
I shouldn't hide
what I want from...

59:01.371 --> 59:03.665
Anyone.

59:03.665 --> 59:05.500
Thank you for
telling me that.

59:09.629 --> 59:11.256
Wait right here.

59:21.557 --> 59:23.518

You didn't finish?

59:33.194 --> 59:35.655
It takes so much work
to finish a tree.

59:35.655 --> 59:38.241
Yes, yes it does.

59:38.241 --> 59:39.909
Okay, I've gotta go now

59:39.909 --> 59:41.911
but I'll come by tomorrow
before I go to my parents'

59:41.911 --> 59:43.079
and help you finish.

59:43.079 --> 59:45.039
I would like that
very much.

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:34.339
[ringtone]

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:38.092
You're calling to say you will
be there tonight after all!

01:00:38.092 --> 01:00:41.346
Actually, I'm callinge because
my boss gave me box tickets

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:42.930
to the game tomorrow.

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.807
David's holiday
party is tomorrow.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:47.477
I know, but you
know how my boss is.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:49.812
When she asks,
she's not really asking.

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:52.106
I get it.

01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:53.358
Listen I gotta go.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:55.610
I need to make sure
this toy is ready.

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.362
Say hi to your folks
tonight for me.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.545
[knock on the door]

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:24.472
OK, we don't have
a lot of time

01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:26.849
and a ton
of work to do...

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:29.143
This looks exactly the same
as when we stopped.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.605
Whoa, what's wrong?

01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:34.399
Wrong?
Oh, no, it's good news.

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:35.858
We don't have to
finish the tree.

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:38.653
Well, why not?

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:41.030
Seems like Heather
thinks it's too soon

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.074
for me to meet her dad.

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:47.161
And for us to spend
the holidays together.

01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:50.706
And be in
a relationship...

01:01:50.706 --> 01:01:52.875
You broke up?

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.753
Apparently we were
"moving too fast"

01:01:55.753 --> 01:01:58.047
and she was sure
"her dad was going to love me"

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:01.217
and that it would make
things "too hard."

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:03.594
What does that
even mean?

01:02:03.594 --> 01:02:06.347
I'm so sorry, Jonathan.

01:02:06.347 --> 01:02:09.350
Honestly, the more I think about
it the more it feels right.

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:12.103
Heather was great,

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:14.355
but we really did
see the world differently.

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.443
Guess I don't have to
impress her family anymore.

01:02:22.613 --> 01:02:24.240
Will lighting
the menorah help?

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.242
I tried,
it didn't help much.

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:28.369
A pile of latkes
sorta did.

01:02:32.665 --> 01:02:34.792
I have an amazing idea!

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:37.128
I don't like
the sound of this.

01:02:46.804 --> 01:02:49.098
How did you talk
me into this?

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:52.727
You had no plans tonight,
all those presents...

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:54.687
What were you going to do?
Stay home and mope?

01:02:54.687 --> 01:02:59.484
Yeah, I had moping and feeling
sorry for myself all lined up.

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:01.402
You're gonna
love my family

01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:03.154
and they already
have a seat set up,

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:06.073
shame for it go to waste.

01:03:06.073 --> 01:03:07.617
They couldn't put in
a little effort

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.118
to make it festive around here?

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:11.329
[Christy laughs]

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:13.915
I never grow tired
of hearing you laugh.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:16.918
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey there.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:19.003
-How are you kiddo?
-Good.

01:03:19.003 --> 01:03:21.422
Dad this is Jonathan,

01:03:21.422 --> 01:03:23.007
Jonathan this is my dad.

01:03:23.007 --> 01:03:25.009
Jonathan, great to
finally meet you.

01:03:25.009 --> 01:03:26.427
Hope you like eggnog.

01:03:26.427 --> 01:03:28.971
I'm not sure.
Never had it before.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.681
Alright then,
this is gonna be fun.

01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.183
Please, come on in.

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:33.518
Can I?

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.606
So, Christy tells us
you're a teacher.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:41.817
Middle school. Yes.

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:43.528
More than just
middle school.

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:46.030
She's been teaching me as much
as I've been teaching her.

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:47.532
I don't know about that.

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:49.033
[all laugh]

01:03:49.033 --> 01:03:51.661
I'm sorry, is that the Dead Sea?

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:54.956
Actually it is, yeah.
Here's the Taj Mahal.

01:03:57.542 --> 01:04:00.044
And is this the Amazon?

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:02.588
I may be spoiled but they
could use air-conditioning.

01:04:02.588 --> 01:04:04.257
-Mom.
-What?

01:04:05.424 --> 01:04:07.552
To know something you really
have to experience it,

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.512
don't you think?

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.472
I definitely do.

01:04:13.474 --> 01:04:15.560
Come on in
and meet everyone.

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:24.360
That was delicious.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.653
Thank you.

01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:27.196
Wait til you have mom's pie.

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:29.240
Is there a special pie
for Hanukkah, Jonathan?

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.242
We don't really do pie,

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:32.577
but we have sofganyot...

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:35.538
They're like amazing
jelly donuts

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:39.500
baked in this awesome way,
to put it technically.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.753
I think we had those in Israel,
didn't we dear?

01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:44.589
You're right, yup.
Sugar on top.

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:45.840
Absolutely delicious.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.092
[all laugh]
[distant singing]

01:04:48.092 --> 01:04:49.552
You hear that?

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:51.262
The carolers are here!

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:53.556
They're outside.
Please, come.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.766
Come on, everybody!

01:04:55.766 --> 01:04:57.518

come from?

Hanukkah songs!

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:16.430
We also have them.

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:17.890

one of my lessons.

Thank you.

Not a bad haul for your
first White Elephant.

01:06:32.863 --> 01:06:34.323
I'm so sorry I stole it.

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:35.991
You can definitely
have it back...

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:37.118
Really?

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:38.911
-Yeah.
-No, I'm just kidding.

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:40.246
It's all yours.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:41.872
You have to
come back next year.

01:06:41.872 --> 01:06:43.999
Careful,
I'll take you up on that.

01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:45.543
Expect that.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:46.836
Bye my darling.

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.212
-I love you.
-I love you too.

-Thank you guys.
-You're welcome.

-Bye.
-Goodnight.

01:07:08.607 --> 01:07:11.068
Your family's
something else.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:14.780
That's what
it's all about.

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.074
Christmas I mean.

01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:21.662
The tree,
the food, the gifts,

01:07:21.662 --> 01:07:22.955
it's all great but,

01:07:22.955 --> 01:07:24.749
when it comes down to it,

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:27.835
what makes it
truly special

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:29.628
is just being with
the people you love.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:34.300
That's my
last lesson.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:38.679
When you understand that,
you understand Christmas.

01:07:38.679 --> 01:07:40.765
Well what do you know?

01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:43.434
Another thing Christmas
and Hanukkah have in common.

01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:59.325
[alarm buzzes]

01:08:20.304 --> 01:08:22.973
OK, so, don't be mad.

01:08:22.973 --> 01:08:25.850
I'll tell you the same thing I
tell Alex when she says that --

01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:27.269
no deal.

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:30.147
I gave Pat your
statistic reports.

01:08:30.147 --> 01:08:31.607
Why?

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:34.734
Because you are
amazing at research

01:08:34.734 --> 01:08:37.738
and would be a huge asset
to sales if you tried.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.865
But you weren't
going to try so...

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:40.866
I tricked you.

01:08:40.866 --> 01:08:42.993
And?

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:46.080
And he said it's
exactly what he needed.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.747
And that as soon
as there's an opening

01:08:47.747 --> 01:08:49.041
he would offer you the job.

01:08:49.041 --> 01:08:50.835
Well can you go
and get promoted,

01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:52.670
so that job
in sales opens up?

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:54.255
Definitely!

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:58.676
Don't stay too late,
it's Christmas Eve!

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:00.678
And wish me luck.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:02.011
Good luck!

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:19.446
Hey, where's Peter?

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:25.035
Babe, what are
you doing here?

01:09:25.035 --> 01:09:27.872
I came to talk...
What's going on?

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.832
You remember the guys
from the office.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.207
We're getting ready
for the big game.

01:09:31.207 --> 01:09:33.127
Your boss invited
all of you?

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.546
Not exactly.

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:37.798
We found out this morning
she had to fly out of town

01:09:37.798 --> 01:09:38.883
and can't make it.

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:40.885
Luckily for us she
gave me the tickets

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:43.720
so, we're all going.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.683
I came here to tell you that
I didn't really need you

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.560
to come tonight.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.145
Great!

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:52.479
But I wanted you to.

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.400
Oh.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.028
Peter I thought the reason
you weren't coming

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.446
was because of work.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:01.906
It is.

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:04.033
But I kinda really want
to go to the game too...

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:07.328
Besides I didn't want to get
in the way while you worked.

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:09.955
You didn't ask me what I
wanted though, did you?

01:10:32.269 --> 01:10:33.771
I...

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.943
Wow, you look
wonderful.

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:41.403
Sorry to stop
by unannounced,

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:46.408
I'm just on my way to the
dinner and wanted to thank you.

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:50.204
You were a great student.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:54.291
Not for the lessons,
for the support.

01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:57.211
I don't know what's going
to happen tonight

01:10:57.211 --> 01:11:00.381
but I do know
what I want now.

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:01.715
And I'm gonna go for it.

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:08.931
Is Peter going to
join you at the party?

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:12.476
Oh, I don't think
that's going to happen...

01:11:12.476 --> 01:11:15.980
Seeing as how we
just broke up.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.316
I'm so sorry.
Come in.

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:26.407
What happened?

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:31.120
I realized we've been
holding on to the idea

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.997
of each other
for so long

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:36.417
we'd lost sight of what
we really wanted...

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.923
Wow.

01:11:42.923 --> 01:11:44.508
What do you think?

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:50.889
It's beautiful but...

01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:52.266
why?

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:56.145
It occurred to
me last night

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.313
that we put so
much effort into this,

01:11:58.313 --> 01:11:59.690
it would be a shame
not to finish it.

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.275
I was going to
send you a picture

01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:02.985
but now that you're here,
what do you think?

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.361
Did I do it right?

01:12:04.361 --> 01:12:07.740
Things worth doing,
are worth doing right.

01:12:16.957 --> 01:12:21.712
I remembered you were
admiring it so...

01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:29.053
Why don't you
come with me tonight?

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:32.056
To the party?
Do you need me to?

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:36.643
No...
But I want you to.

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:41.732
Give me a minute...

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.620
What do you think?

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.246
I think you need to
wear suits more often.

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.422
Of all the years
I've been teaching,

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:07.674
the past few days have
been the most inspiring.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.928
I bet you say that
to all your students.

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:17.476
Is that?

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:18.852
Yeah.

01:13:18.852 --> 01:13:20.771
I was trying to be as
authentic as possible.

01:13:24.024 --> 01:13:27.444
I don't know how
to tell you this

01:13:27.444 --> 01:13:30.405
but, that's parsley.

01:13:30.405 --> 01:13:31.949
That's not mistletoe.

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:36.620
There's a difference
between parsley...

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.748
-Yeah, a little bit.
-Good to know.

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:43.502
[both laugh]

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:45.295
-It's pretty close, though.
-Yeah, super.

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.735
Thank you very much,
very nice of you to say,

01:14:08.735 --> 01:14:11.238
credit goes to
my lovely wife as always.

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:13.657
Thank you so much for coming,
it's great to see you.

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:17.870
Christy Dickinson,
so nice to see you.

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:19.163
And who is this?

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:21.248
This is Jonathan,
and Jonathan this is David,

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:22.624
our gracious host.

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:24.543
-You have a beautiful home.
-Thank you, Jonathan.

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:25.752
Welcome.

01:14:25.752 --> 01:14:27.004
And these are for you.

01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:28.672
My my, do you mind
if I open them now?

01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:29.882
[Christy]
Go for it.

01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:34.261
Just like my Savta
used to make in Israel.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.352
My goodness, where
did you find these?

01:14:42.352 --> 01:14:44.479
I made them, actually.

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:47.232
Fancy that.
Enjoy the party.

01:14:47.232 --> 01:14:49.484
Please, both of you.
Pat's over there, FYI.

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:51.361
We'll be lighting
the candles shortly,

01:14:51.361 --> 01:14:52.571
I'll find you.

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:54.031
Enjoy.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.784
Is it too late
to make a break for it?

01:14:57.784 --> 01:14:59.870
If you need a distraction
just give me the signal

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.705
and I'll break into
"Hanukkah, Oh Hanukkah."

01:15:01.705 --> 01:15:02.998
Perfect.

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:05.167
-Shall we?
-Sure.

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:07.377
[both]
Thank you.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:20.224
What is this?

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:22.392
David's wife
grew up with Christmas.

01:15:22.392 --> 01:15:24.311
They incorporate it into
the Hanukkah party every year.

01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:27.356
He meant it when they
said they go all out.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:28.857
Beautiful.

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:31.109
Sure is...

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:35.656
Would have been really useful
information about a week ago.

01:15:37.741 --> 01:15:39.159
Pat, this is Jonathan.

01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:42.663
Have you seen
Toys & Tricks yet?

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:44.081
Oh yes.

01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:45.832
And you'll never guess who
they're newest employee is.

01:15:49.753 --> 01:15:51.213
Edgar works for
Toys & Tricks?

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:52.923
As of yesterday.

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:55.592
Seems he had information
they found very useful.

01:15:55.592 --> 01:15:57.511
Oh, no...
How bad?

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.346
Hope you brought
your A-Game.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.602
So we don't like Edgar?

01:16:05.602 --> 01:16:07.271
Mmm mmm.

01:16:16.029 --> 01:16:17.447
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:16:17.447 --> 01:16:19.032
May I have your
attention please?

01:16:19.032 --> 01:16:21.285
It's time to
light the menorah

01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:23.287
one last time this year.

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:26.873
Usually we offer this honor
to one of our special guests...

01:16:26.873 --> 01:16:30.335
An expert, perhaps?

01:16:30.335 --> 01:16:32.212
You got this.

01:16:32.212 --> 01:16:33.964
It would be
an honor, David.

and thank you
everyone for coming.

01:17:45.869 --> 01:17:48.205
Please enjoy the rest
of the evening!

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.875
It's such a pleasure
having you here.

01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:53.293
I probably
shouldn't say this

01:17:53.293 --> 01:17:57.214
but I do hope your idea
is better than Toys & Tricks.

01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:58.548
You didn't like theirs?

01:17:58.548 --> 01:18:00.634
I'm not thrilled with it
but the board thinks

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:02.552
they're the more
economical option.

01:18:02.552 --> 01:18:05.847
It will be hard to
convince them otherwise.

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:08.058
Well if you have a minute
I can grab my prototype.

01:18:08.058 --> 01:18:10.060
I think you'll like it.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:11.395
As long as it's
not as boring as

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:13.397
"Congressional Action Figures."

01:18:14.731 --> 01:18:17.025
Congressional
Action Figures?

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:19.152
That was their idea.

01:18:19.152 --> 01:18:22.572
It's not terrible but...

01:18:22.572 --> 01:18:24.699
a little boring.

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:27.577
Your boyfriend is wonderful
with kids, by the way.

01:18:27.577 --> 01:18:29.704
Oh, he's not...

01:18:29.704 --> 01:18:31.164
Thank you.

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.088
Okay, I'll be back guys.

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.467
Hey, what happened?

01:18:42.467 --> 01:18:44.594
That jerk Edgar
stole my idea!

01:18:44.594 --> 01:18:45.929
What? How?

01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:48.056
Doesn't matter,
because my gut was right,

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:49.391
it boring.

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.935
Still, now I have
nothing to show David...

01:18:57.524 --> 01:18:59.401
You never got
to teach me dreidel.

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:01.486
[Jonathan] You think
you could use this somehow?

01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:03.613
Nope.
I got nothing.

01:19:03.613 --> 01:19:06.158
Well it wasn't my favorite
game growing up anyway.

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:10.787
My favorite game was this
Hanukkah game I made up

01:19:10.787 --> 01:19:13.290
called Maccabees
vs. The Greeks.

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:14.374
What did you say?

01:19:14.374 --> 01:19:15.876
Maccabees
vs. The Greeks.

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:17.210
I had to play make believe

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:18.628
since they didn't actually
have toys for it...

01:19:18.628 --> 01:19:20.130
I could kiss you!

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:21.381
What's that now?

01:19:21.381 --> 01:19:24.509
And here we are,
so how about that pitch?

01:19:24.509 --> 01:19:27.804
Oh I can't just
yet because...

01:19:27.804 --> 01:19:30.807
Jonathan wanted to
lead everyone in song!

01:19:33.393 --> 01:19:34.436
I did?

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:35.645
You sure did!

01:19:35.645 --> 01:19:37.647
And drag it out!

01:19:37.647 --> 01:19:40.650
Alright.

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:44.279
Hope you're all
having a great evening.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:47.240

That was perfect.

01:21:01.439 --> 01:21:03.191
Great! Why did I do that?

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:06.069
Jonathan,
that was wonderful.

01:21:06.069 --> 01:21:08.196
Yes. It was, wasn't it?

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:10.156
As is this...

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:14.578
What is this?

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:15.912
A Maccabee.

01:21:15.912 --> 01:21:17.330
A Maccabee?

01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:20.250
It's just a rough prototype,
we'll fill in the details

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:22.252
but remember growing up

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:24.838
how you used to have
to pretend to be a Maccabee

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:27.090
because there was no toy
out there to play with?

01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:29.384
Yes, yes that's
exactly right.

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.469
Well now there could be.

01:21:31.469 --> 01:21:33.096
Not just the Maccabees,

01:21:33.096 --> 01:21:34.931
an entire biblical themed

01:21:34.931 --> 01:21:36.641
action figure toy line.

01:21:36.641 --> 01:21:37.934
David the King!

01:21:37.934 --> 01:21:39.561
Yes! Ruth and Esther!

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.062
Everyone!

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:42.939
And, every action figure would
have their own comic book

01:21:42.939 --> 01:21:44.441
to tell their story.

01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:47.027
Kids would learn
while they played.

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:51.781
This is...

01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:53.450
A game changer!

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:55.452
This is what
we should be working on!

01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:56.870
You think the board
will go along with it?

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:59.122
Oh yes, yes I do.

01:21:59.122 --> 01:22:01.291
It's economical,
fills a hole in the market,

01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:02.876
and it's actually good.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:05.086
Christy, do you want to be
in business together?

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:06.713
That's exactly
what I want, David.

01:22:08.548 --> 01:22:10.634
Can I... Keep this for a bit?

01:22:10.634 --> 01:22:11.885
It's all yours.

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.638
Maccabee.

01:22:25.398 --> 01:22:27.108
Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:28.485
Are you kidding?
That was all you!

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:30.070
You're amazing.

01:22:33.573 --> 01:22:36.159
Next time,
for reference...

01:22:36.159 --> 01:22:37.661
That's mistletoe.

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:05.855
There she is!

01:23:05.855 --> 01:23:08.191
The board loved it!
Everyone loved it.

01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:09.526
Congratulations, Christie.

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:11.444
It is a fantastic toy line.

01:23:11.444 --> 01:23:15.073
I was just telling David how,
as our new senior designer,

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:17.117
we could not be
prouder of you.

01:23:17.117 --> 01:23:19.661
When can we launch?

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.621
We'll rush it
so it's out by April.

01:23:21.621 --> 01:23:22.706
So soon?

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:23.873
Oh, I get it.

01:23:23.873 --> 01:23:25.875
You want to be
ready for Passover.
