WEBVTT

00:01.343 --> 00:02.074
<i>So here's what you missed</i>

00:02.094 --> 00:03.477
<i>Santana thought that Brody</i>

00:03.512 --> 00:05.296
<i>was a drug dealer...</i>
He's not a drug dealer.

00:05.330 --> 00:06.731
<i>...but it turns out</i>
<i>he's a gigolo.</i>

00:06.765 --> 00:08.148
<i>And Santana figured it out</i>
<i>and told Finn...</i>

00:08.183 --> 00:10.234
Pack your bags.
<i>...so Finn went to New York,</i>

00:10.269 --> 00:11.269
<i>beat the crap out of Brody</i>
<i>and told him to...</i>

00:11.303 --> 00:13.488
Stay away from my future wife!

00:13.490 --> 00:15.840
<i>And Rachel has no idea</i>
<i>any of this is going on. Yikes.</i>

00:15.874 --> 00:17.575
<i>Will's still mad at Finn</i>
<i>for kissing Emma...</i>

00:17.609 --> 00:19.110
I'm so sorry.
Sorry's not going to cut it.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.129
<i>...so Finn left the glee club</i>
<i>to go to college to become</i>

00:21.163 --> 00:22.780
<i>a teacher, and Blaine's got a</i>
<i>crush on Sam, which he's had</i>

00:22.814 --> 00:25.116
<i>every since the Sadie Hawkins</i>
<i>dance, but Sam just thinks that</i>

00:25.150 --> 00:27.085
<i>he and Blaine are besties,</i>
<i>which they totally are,</i>

00:27.119 --> 00:29.755
<i>but still... And that's
what you missed on...</i> Glee!

00:30.873 --> 00:34.292
Here. Don't tell anyone
and you don't have to thank me.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.844
Dude, what are you doing?

00:36.879 --> 00:39.430
It's only 50 bucks.
Just take the money.

00:39.465 --> 00:42.600
I know what you've been up to,
and it just has to stop.

00:42.634 --> 00:44.519
What are you talking about?

00:44.553 --> 00:46.020
<i>Last week, I found a shortcut</i>

00:46.054 --> 00:47.638
<i>between my locker</i>
<i>and the parking lot...</i>

00:47.672 --> 00:49.440
<i>walking through the cafeteria</i>
<i>cuts out 15 seconds</i>

00:49.475 --> 00:53.311
<i>from my daily routine...</i>
<i>and yesterday I saw something.</i>

00:57.900 --> 00:59.283
Listen, I know your dad's been

00:59.318 --> 01:00.785
struggling,
and I just want to help.

01:00.819 --> 01:03.287
Help you feed your family.

01:03.322 --> 01:05.022
Hunger's a big problem
in this country.

01:05.040 --> 01:08.025
Although so is obesity,
which is confusing.

01:08.043 --> 01:10.128
Okay, can you promise
to keep a secret?

01:10.162 --> 01:11.529
Yeah, of course.

01:11.547 --> 01:13.581
I have been stealing pasta.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.801
But it's not for dinner.

01:16.835 --> 01:18.803
It's...

01:18.837 --> 01:20.138
it's art.

01:22.925 --> 01:25.560
So... what do you think?

01:28.096 --> 01:30.648
Are those macaroni portraits?

01:30.682 --> 01:31.983
They're my guilty pleasure.

01:32.017 --> 01:33.901
My art teacher thinks
I'm some sort of a genius,

01:33.936 --> 01:36.988
like the ugly guy in <i>Shine</i>
except with macaroni.

01:37.022 --> 01:38.389
Is this Emma Stone?
Yeah.

01:38.407 --> 01:40.241
And then you got LeAnn Rimes,

01:40.275 --> 01:42.043
Ralph Macchio.

01:42.077 --> 01:43.911
Those are the guys
from <i>Duck Dynasty.</i>

01:43.946 --> 01:45.246
I even did Kurt.

01:46.698 --> 01:48.366
The macaroni
really captures him.

01:49.868 --> 01:51.869
Thank you for sharing this
with me.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.171
This is really incredible.

01:53.205 --> 01:54.205
Whoa, whoa, not so fast.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.007
Now it's your turn. So...

01:56.041 --> 01:59.010
My turn for what?

01:59.044 --> 02:00.261
For your guilty pleasure.

02:00.295 --> 02:03.181
I... I don't have
a guilty pleasure.

02:03.215 --> 02:04.415
Okay, you're lying.

02:04.433 --> 02:05.933
Everybody's got that one thing
that they like

02:05.968 --> 02:07.185
that they're so ashamed of

02:07.219 --> 02:09.020
that they refuse
to admit it to anybody.

02:09.054 --> 02:11.422
I love...

02:11.440 --> 02:13.191
Wham!

02:13.225 --> 02:15.359
What?
The band Wham!

02:15.394 --> 02:16.777
They're like my favorite
band of all time.

02:16.812 --> 02:18.029
Hi, guys.

02:18.063 --> 02:19.763
Hey, Tina.

02:19.781 --> 02:20.781
Hey, Tina.

02:20.816 --> 02:22.617
Did you hear the news?

02:22.651 --> 02:24.602
Mr. Shue is out with
the flu this week.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.704
Hey, uh, just curious. Are you
gonna go over to his house

02:26.738 --> 02:28.105
and straddle him
while he's passed out

02:28.123 --> 02:29.290
and rub some ointment on chest?

02:29.324 --> 02:30.875
That's was a phase.

02:30.909 --> 02:33.411
Anyway, don't bother coming
to Glee Club this week.

02:33.445 --> 02:34.612
It's canceled.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.800
Not necessarily.

02:41.641 --> 02:43.995
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

02:45.759 --> 02:47.058
Why are we here?
I thought Mr. Shue was sick.

02:47.092 --> 02:48.626
Yeah, why are we here?

02:48.644 --> 02:50.923
I was wondering the same thing.

02:50.940 --> 02:54.159
Oh, come on, guys. Regionals
is only a few weeks away.

02:54.194 --> 02:57.162
Even without an adviser, we can't
afford to miss one week of preparation.

02:57.197 --> 02:59.498
Which is why Blaine and I asked
you all to come here.

02:59.532 --> 03:01.900
We have come up with an
assignment for this week.

03:01.918 --> 03:03.402
Please be songs about sweaters.

03:05.705 --> 03:07.840
Huh?

03:07.874 --> 03:10.843
Guilty pleasures. Come on!

03:10.877 --> 03:13.345
We all have some musical shame.
You know what I'm talking about.

03:13.380 --> 03:16.081
You know, that secret love we dare
not speak, but when it comes out

03:16.099 --> 03:17.683
on the radio,
you can't help but turn up

03:17.717 --> 03:18.667
the volume and sing along?

03:18.702 --> 03:19.885
Yeah, and we're
supposed to sing

03:19.919 --> 03:21.186
one of those songs
for regionals?

03:21.221 --> 03:23.439
No. Sam and I were speaking
earlier,

03:23.473 --> 03:24.756
just, like, shooting the crap

03:24.774 --> 03:26.358
like two bros do, you know,

03:26.393 --> 03:28.944
and we felt really safe
with each other.

03:28.978 --> 03:31.563
So we decided to reveal
our guilty pleasures.

03:31.597 --> 03:35.034
And it felt amazing. I mean,
letting go of this big secret

03:35.068 --> 03:36.518
made me feel so good.

03:36.553 --> 03:39.621
And figured if we all share
musical shame with each other,

03:39.656 --> 03:42.041
we could all become a more
cohesive team for regionals.

03:42.075 --> 03:43.442
Unique knows no shame, baby.

03:43.460 --> 03:45.294
So, besides Unique, does anybody
else have something

03:45.328 --> 03:46.545
they would like to share?

03:46.579 --> 03:50.082
Guys, this is a great
team-building exercise.

03:50.116 --> 03:51.633
Okay, well,
then you guys go first.

03:51.668 --> 03:54.636

you, we could... show you!

Everyone hates you.

06:06.102 --> 06:08.086
Excuse me?

06:08.104 --> 06:10.255
Maybe that's why nobody wants
to work with you.

06:12.225 --> 06:14.193
I'm trying to change,
but my pastor says

06:14.227 --> 06:15.394
even Jesus took baby steps.

06:15.428 --> 06:17.262
Do you go to the
Church of Satan?

06:17.280 --> 06:18.430
Because you're really mean.

06:18.448 --> 06:20.232
You tell Marley that she's fat

06:20.266 --> 06:21.867
even though your face
looks like a soccer ball,

06:21.901 --> 06:23.402
and we both know that
blonds have magical powers,

06:23.436 --> 06:26.038
like doing the splits
or turning Swedish.

06:26.072 --> 06:30.042
You need to use your magical
powers for good and not evil.

06:30.076 --> 06:32.878
And that is why I'm inviting you
to take off your Joker mask

06:32.912 --> 06:34.546
and bare your soul
for the world to see.

06:34.581 --> 06:37.799

Tonight's guest is McKinley
High's biggest bitch,

the girl with the weird
lizard ears, Kitty.

06:49.128 --> 06:50.262
Mm...

06:50.296 --> 06:52.080
that cat has
about three weeks to live

06:52.115 --> 06:54.416
and this fondue smells
like hot acrid barf.

06:54.450 --> 06:56.101
Thank you so much.
So, Kitty,

06:56.135 --> 06:57.669
everyone at school hates you

06:57.704 --> 07:00.138
because you're a two-faced lying
slut who no one can trust.

07:00.173 --> 07:03.625
True. And yet everyone keeps
telling me their secrets,

07:03.660 --> 07:06.094
so I must be doing
something right.

07:06.129 --> 07:08.113
Touché. I think the problem is

07:08.147 --> 07:09.498
that people haven't gotten
to know you yet.

07:09.532 --> 07:12.167
So tonight, you, me
and Lord Tubbington

07:12.201 --> 07:14.419
are gonna tell our deepest
darkest secrets.

07:14.454 --> 07:16.321
You tell me
your guilty pleasures

07:16.339 --> 07:17.989
and I'll tell you mine. Go.

07:18.007 --> 07:20.609
Guilty pleasure?
Mm.

07:20.643 --> 07:22.344
I like to fart around
old people and watch the look

07:22.378 --> 07:24.162
on their faces 'cause they just
assume they did it.

07:24.180 --> 07:25.631
That's awesome. Me, too.

07:25.665 --> 07:26.765
Okay, guilty pleasure.

07:26.799 --> 07:28.333
When I look at
a white dog or cat,

07:28.351 --> 07:30.018
I assume that they're racist.

07:30.053 --> 07:33.338
Lord Tubbington's guilty
pleasure is Scientology.

07:33.356 --> 07:35.023
Guilty pleasure. Bring it on.

07:35.058 --> 07:37.442
Guilty pleasure.
Bring it on again.

07:37.477 --> 07:39.311
Guilty pleasure.
Bring it on, all or nothing.

07:39.345 --> 07:40.279
Bring it on, in it to win it.

07:40.313 --> 07:41.947
Bring it on,
fight to the finish.

07:41.981 --> 07:43.482
That one's horrible. There's no
way you could like that.

07:43.516 --> 07:44.516
Guilty pleasure!

07:44.534 --> 07:46.201
No, I can't say.

07:46.235 --> 07:47.519
No, you can't do that.

07:47.537 --> 07:49.204
Come on.
This is the safe space.

07:49.238 --> 07:50.522
We're on the Internet.

07:50.556 --> 07:52.857
No.

07:52.875 --> 07:55.694
No.

07:55.712 --> 07:57.379
It's too horrible.

07:57.413 --> 07:58.580
Can you whisper it in my ear?

08:04.053 --> 08:06.054
Oh, my God.

08:07.757 --> 08:11.059
See, everybody, by acting out
our secret shames,

08:11.094 --> 08:13.178
like Carly's traumatic
sense-memory

08:13.212 --> 08:15.547
of potty training,

08:15.565 --> 08:18.216
we become more
vulnerable as actors.

08:18.234 --> 08:21.269
Kurt, you're up.

08:23.556 --> 08:25.557
<i>You want to see
some real acting?</i>

08:25.575 --> 08:27.993
<i>You're looking at it,</i>
<i>because this is nothing</i>

08:28.027 --> 08:29.411
<i>compared to my real</i>
<i>guilty secrets.</i>

08:29.445 --> 08:32.364
<i>And as a gay man,</i>
<i>there are so many to pick from.</i>

08:32.398 --> 08:35.082
<i>Like my obsessive marathons</i>

08:35.118 --> 08:37.001
<i>- of powerhouse women</i>-

08:37.035 --> 08:40.405
Golden Girls, Murder She Wrote,
Moonlighting, Designing Women.

08:40.440 --> 08:43.908
<i>Or my very private</i> Sweatin'
to the Oldies <i>sessions on DVD</i>

08:43.926 --> 08:45.544
<i>with the uncompromising</i>
<i>Richard Simmons.</i>

08:45.578 --> 08:49.047
<i>But my most secret, my most</i>
<i>guilty pleasure of late?</i>

08:49.081 --> 08:50.599
<i>My boyfriend arm.</i>

08:50.633 --> 08:52.901
<i>I ordered it online one night</i>
<i>while on Ambien.</i>

08:52.935 --> 08:56.221
<i>Yes, I know it's a little bit</i>
<i>Jeffrey Dahmer,</i>

08:56.255 --> 08:58.190
<i>but what can I say?</i>

08:58.224 --> 09:00.692
<i>I love being held in Bruce's</i>
<i>warm, non-judgmental embrace.</i>

09:00.727 --> 09:02.361
<i>And yes, I named him Bruce.</i>

09:02.395 --> 09:04.429
<i>That's my real guilty secret.</i>

09:04.447 --> 09:06.431
<i>And if anyone ever found out,</i>
<i>especially Adam,</i>

09:06.449 --> 09:08.200
<i>or God forbid, Blaine,</i>

09:08.234 --> 09:11.870
<i>or even Rachel and Santana,</i>
<i>it would totally destroy me.</i>

09:13.406 --> 09:15.907
Dude, put some pants on.
I need to talk to you.

09:15.941 --> 09:19.611
<i>So, lately I've...</i>
<i>I've been battling</i>

09:19.629 --> 09:23.081
a really deep-seeded sense of
shame about something in my life,

09:23.115 --> 09:24.299
and it's a secret
I've kept buried

09:24.333 --> 09:26.585
for as long as I can remember.
Really?

09:26.619 --> 09:28.787
Yeah, and I've been waiting

09:28.805 --> 09:32.174
to, like, let it out and release this
inner sin that's tortured my insides.

09:35.144 --> 09:37.479
Do-do you have
feelings for me?

09:37.513 --> 09:39.097
What? Dude, no, come on.
What?

09:39.131 --> 09:41.099
Obvious-obviously,
I'm kidding. I'm just...

09:41.133 --> 09:43.101
It's a million times worse
than that.

09:43.135 --> 09:46.988
Well, until you can speak it,
you're gonna be stuck

09:47.023 --> 09:48.990
in this shame spiral
forever, so...

09:49.025 --> 09:50.442
Hey, you can...

09:50.476 --> 09:52.527
you can trust me.
You can tell me anything.

09:54.980 --> 09:57.833
I like Barry Manilow.
What?

09:57.867 --> 09:59.951
I said I like Barry Manilow.

10:03.873 --> 10:05.340
No, no, no, you can't-you can't
say that in a locker room.

10:05.374 --> 10:09.845
I know, I know, I know, but see,
I just relate to his stories:

10:09.879 --> 10:11.012
The-the breakups,
the lost love.

10:11.047 --> 10:13.298
Oh, and the rain, who shot who?

10:13.332 --> 10:14.999
It's like he's
talking right to me.

10:15.017 --> 10:17.469
Well, then I think
you need to come out

10:17.503 --> 10:19.137
to everyone and say that.

10:19.171 --> 10:20.138
No.

10:20.172 --> 10:21.189
Once you stop hiding,

10:21.224 --> 10:23.024
you'll feel so much better.

10:23.059 --> 10:24.276
You really think
I could just...

10:24.310 --> 10:26.778
stand up in front
of everybody and

10:26.813 --> 10:29.314
say that I'm a Fan-ilow?

10:34.395 --> 10:36.146
Stop! As loyal fans
of <i>Fondue for Two,</i>

10:36.180 --> 10:38.515
we demand to know what your
guilty pleasure is. Tell us.

10:38.533 --> 10:40.651
None of your business.

10:40.685 --> 10:42.653
Spice Girls.

10:46.574 --> 10:48.659
I love the Spice Girls!

10:50.161 --> 10:52.329
Okay, keep it down.
People are staring.

10:52.363 --> 10:54.965
When I was little, I had
the Spice Girl movie on a loop.

10:54.999 --> 10:57.000
I used to make their clothes
out of my grandmother's sheets.

10:57.034 --> 10:58.335
I dreamed I was one of them.

10:58.369 --> 11:00.870
We must do the Spice Girls.
It has to be done!

11:00.889 --> 11:03.307
And this fierce black woman
will be Scary Spice.

11:03.341 --> 11:05.208
Nothing scarier than a girl
with a penis.

11:08.062 --> 11:10.046
Kidding.

11:11.566 --> 11:13.684
Okay, this is ridiculous.
If I'm going to be paying

11:13.718 --> 11:15.235
a third of the rent,

11:15.270 --> 11:17.854
I'm going to be needing
a third of the shelf space.

11:17.888 --> 11:20.574
Don't get too comfortable, okay?
This is only temporary.

11:20.608 --> 11:22.526
I don't even think you need all
these beauty products, Rachel,

11:22.560 --> 11:23.744
'cause they're not really having
the desired effect.

11:23.778 --> 11:25.028
Unless you goal is to look like
a reject

11:25.062 --> 11:26.413
from the <i>Shahs of Sunset.</i>

11:26.447 --> 11:27.581
One, Rachel's beautiful.

11:27.615 --> 11:28.749
Two,

11:28.783 --> 11:30.033
you're a bitch,
and those are my products, okay?

11:30.067 --> 11:31.752
And maybe if you used them,

11:31.786 --> 11:33.754
you wouldn't have more oil than
the Middle East on your face.

11:33.788 --> 11:35.005
Ooh.

11:35.039 --> 11:36.757
That's really funny.

11:36.791 --> 11:38.675
You
want to play with me, Kurt,

11:38.710 --> 11:40.761
'cause I can play
all day every day.

11:40.795 --> 11:44.014
What if I just told your BFF

11:44.048 --> 11:46.099
about her BF
and his man-whoring ways?

11:47.719 --> 11:48.885
We had a pact.

11:48.919 --> 11:50.187
What if I broke that pact, huh?

11:50.221 --> 11:52.055
What would you do?
Attack me

11:52.089 --> 11:53.256
with your exfoliating loofah?

11:53.274 --> 11:54.758
Okay, she can't find out

11:54.776 --> 11:55.925
until after her
<i>Funny Girl</i> audition, all right?

11:55.944 --> 11:57.694
That would wreck her.
Maybe if you made me

11:57.729 --> 11:59.863
some space,
I'd care a little bit more.

11:59.897 --> 12:01.898
I want that whole top row.

12:05.787 --> 12:06.903
Ooh la la.

12:06.937 --> 12:08.905
Rachel Berry in a towel.

12:08.939 --> 12:10.407
How could Brody give
all that up?

12:10.441 --> 12:12.108
You know what, not now, okay.

12:12.126 --> 12:13.243
It's too soon.

12:13.277 --> 12:15.078
Everything still reminds me
of him.

12:15.112 --> 12:17.047
You know we first met
in the bathroom,

12:17.081 --> 12:18.448
bonding over
our moisturizing ritual?

12:18.466 --> 12:21.117
Wow, that sounds really
not romantic

12:21.135 --> 12:22.619
and also very, very gay.

12:22.637 --> 12:24.621
Is that why he left,
huh? Did he finally

12:24.639 --> 12:26.757
admit to having a boyfriend
on the side?

12:28.426 --> 12:31.294
You know, he actually didn't
even say why.

12:31.312 --> 12:32.396
I don't understand
what's happening.

12:32.430 --> 12:33.797
Why won't you talk to me?

12:33.815 --> 12:35.315
We'll always be friends.

12:35.350 --> 12:36.566
Puke.

12:36.601 --> 12:38.986
That is the most clichéd
breakup line ever.

12:39.020 --> 12:41.655
You're not gonna be friends,
and you don't need him.

12:41.689 --> 12:43.073
I mean, you've got friends
right here.

12:43.107 --> 12:45.975
What? Friends who mock my looks
and undermine my confidence?

12:45.994 --> 12:48.445
No, friends who cheer you up

12:48.479 --> 12:51.481
by playing pranks
on your other friend.

12:51.499 --> 12:52.749
What are you talking about?

12:52.784 --> 12:54.984
Maybe a mascara mustache
for Lady Hummel,

12:55.003 --> 12:56.753
which would probably be
the only facial hair

12:56.788 --> 12:59.923
he's ever had,
or we could do that

12:59.957 --> 13:02.642
stick-his-hand-in-warm-water-
make-him-wet-the-bed trick?

13:02.677 --> 13:04.678
Lady's choice.

13:12.854 --> 13:14.838
What the hell is that?

13:14.856 --> 13:16.673
Oh, my God,

13:16.691 --> 13:17.841
the curtain means privacy.

13:17.859 --> 13:19.676
Oh, my God, Kurt.

13:19.694 --> 13:20.861
That thing is really creepy.

13:20.895 --> 13:22.446
What is that?

13:22.480 --> 13:24.347
I thought it was stupid
the first time I saw it, too,

13:24.365 --> 13:26.683
but I kept thinking
about the ad.

13:26.701 --> 13:28.618
You know, "Are you lonely?
Do you need companionship?"

13:28.653 --> 13:30.620
"Yes, yes,
I need all those things."

13:30.655 --> 13:32.856
It just offers you a nice, protective arm
around you while you sleep at night.

13:32.874 --> 13:34.124
Hey, I mean, it's probably safer

13:34.158 --> 13:36.026
than trolling Grindr
for a man-whore.

13:36.060 --> 13:37.461
Did you name it?

13:37.495 --> 13:40.964
His name is Bruce,
and we're exclusive.

13:40.998 --> 13:43.417
So you cannot borrow him.

13:46.054 --> 13:48.037
Oh, my gosh.

13:51.008 --> 13:53.477
I love Barry Manilow.

13:53.511 --> 13:55.479
I mean, not just,

13:55.513 --> 13:57.898
you know, the Barry Manilow
Love on Ice Tour,

13:57.932 --> 14:00.734
but-but I think

14:00.768 --> 14:04.321
he's an amazing songwriter
and performer,

14:04.355 --> 14:08.057
an I also believe
he's underappreciated,

14:08.076 --> 14:09.893
has amazing hair,

14:09.911 --> 14:12.045
and has done a hell
of a lot of good for this world

14:12.080 --> 14:14.731
through his
light-rock talent.

14:14.749 --> 14:17.367
This is who I am,
and I make no apologies.

16:30.367 --> 16:31.885
You've given me the courage

16:31.919 --> 16:33.887
to stand... well,

16:33.921 --> 16:35.639
sit in front of my peers
and proudly state

16:35.673 --> 16:37.140
that I'm a Fan-ilow as well.

16:37.174 --> 16:38.207
Guys,

16:38.226 --> 16:39.509
I like him, too.

16:39.543 --> 16:41.144
Music aside,
the guy's got style.

16:41.178 --> 16:42.979
All right, if it was '79,
I'd be rocking

16:43.014 --> 16:44.881
the Manilow center part
instead of the Bieber.

16:44.899 --> 16:47.183
Are you guys kidding?
You guys really like Barry, huh?

16:47.217 --> 16:48.818
Dude, everyone loves Barry,

16:48.853 --> 16:51.321
but thank you for making us
finally say it out loud.

16:51.355 --> 16:52.722
Go Sam.

16:52.740 --> 16:53.890
We love the Barry!

16:56.060 --> 16:58.161
Best number ever!

16:59.914 --> 17:01.731
Okay, everyone,

17:01.749 --> 17:03.166
it's time to decide
which Spice Girls

17:03.200 --> 17:05.068
we're all going to be.

17:07.088 --> 17:09.204
Mercedes, I don't
think that you should be Scary Spice

17:09.239 --> 17:10.540
just because your black.

17:10.574 --> 17:12.742
Excuse you? I think
that it's really racist

17:12.760 --> 17:14.928
that the Scary Spice
is the only black one.

17:14.962 --> 17:16.412
Marley should be Posh Spice
because you're so skinny

17:16.430 --> 17:18.080
and you make everyone
uncomfortable.

17:18.098 --> 17:19.348
Kitty, I think that you

17:19.383 --> 17:21.518
should be Ginger Spice
and I can be Sporty Spice.

17:21.551 --> 17:24.104
So if I'm not Scary Spice,
does that mean I'm Baby Spice?

17:24.137 --> 17:25.888
Sorry I'm late, guys.

17:25.923 --> 17:27.256
Tina, you can be
the Scary Spice.

17:27.275 --> 17:28.525
The black one?
That doesn't make any sense.

17:28.559 --> 17:29.592
That's what I said.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.260
Oh, my God, guys,
you will not believe

17:31.279 --> 17:33.262
what just happened.
It's so horrible,

17:33.281 --> 17:35.265
I'm not even sure
I can repeat it.

17:35.299 --> 17:37.567
Hey!

17:37.601 --> 17:39.268
Tell me it's not true.

17:39.287 --> 17:43.073
Tell me you're not planning
to sing a Chris Brown song.

17:50.784 --> 17:52.284
Looks like our guilty
pleasure lesson

17:52.319 --> 17:54.036
has really been taking
over the school.

17:54.070 --> 17:55.054
Yeah, that kid's always had

17:55.088 --> 17:57.039
a really weird obsession
with culottes.

17:57.073 --> 17:59.158
What's up?

17:59.192 --> 18:00.326
Uh, here's the thing.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.711
Uh, so far this week, you know,
you've been

18:02.746 --> 18:04.163
talking the talk;
But now I need you

18:04.197 --> 18:06.332
To walk the walk, pilgrim.

18:06.366 --> 18:08.417
I've been honest about my guilty
pleasures, and I even wore

18:08.468 --> 18:10.169
- those tiny little Wham! Sh...
- Shh.

18:10.203 --> 18:12.555
I wore those
tiny little Wham! Shorts,

18:12.589 --> 18:14.640
and we did that great
number, but now

18:14.674 --> 18:16.592
it's your turn to be honest,

18:16.643 --> 18:19.211
because you haven't
really been yet so far.

18:20.380 --> 18:22.431
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:22.482 --> 18:24.266
Well, you know, you're only as
sick as your secrets, dude,

18:24.317 --> 18:26.068
and that's what this
week's assignment

18:26.102 --> 18:27.153
is really about.

18:27.187 --> 18:28.237
This is your chance

18:28.271 --> 18:30.022
to really set an example
for the glee club.

18:30.056 --> 18:32.324
What's yours gonna be?

18:35.162 --> 18:36.445
Really? Seriously?

18:36.496 --> 18:38.364
I don't understand
what you're all so upset about.

18:38.398 --> 18:39.915
That's why it's upsetting.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.283
Look, look, I get that
Chris Brown is a douchebag.

18:41.334 --> 18:43.169
I don't think that douche
is a strong enough word

18:43.203 --> 18:44.703
to describe Chris Brown. He
brutally beat up his girlfriend.

18:44.737 --> 18:46.672
He beat up a window
at <i>Good Morning America.</i>

18:46.706 --> 18:48.541
He says horribly misogynistic
things on Twitter.

18:48.575 --> 18:50.459
What about the Frank Ocean fight
in the parking lot?

18:50.510 --> 18:51.677
But mostly, he beat up
his girlfriend, Rihanna,

18:51.711 --> 18:53.429
and then he got a picture
of a battered woman

18:53.463 --> 18:55.514
tattooed on his neck; the dude is psychopath.
I know, listen,

18:55.549 --> 18:58.300
I know, and that is why
I chose his song, okay?

18:58.351 --> 19:00.269
The assignment
was guilty pleasures.

19:00.303 --> 19:02.471
I like his music,
and I feel guilty about it.

19:02.522 --> 19:03.772
You like his music?

19:03.807 --> 19:05.524
Some of it, yeah. I mean,

19:05.559 --> 19:06.976
I don't think all of it's bad.

19:07.010 --> 19:08.194
It doesn't mean that I like him,
and it doesn't mean

19:08.228 --> 19:10.529
that I think
that he's a role model.

19:10.564 --> 19:13.282
We do Whitney Houston songs,
okay, Britney Spears songs,

19:13.316 --> 19:15.401
and none of them
are any role models.

19:15.435 --> 19:17.319
You shut your mouth!
And what about Rihanna?

19:17.370 --> 19:18.821
Do we really think
that bad girl RiRi

19:18.872 --> 19:20.322
is some kind of a role model?

19:20.373 --> 19:21.540
I mean, she's the one
who got back together

19:21.575 --> 19:24.126
with him.
Are you kidding me?

19:24.160 --> 19:26.795
Yes, seriously, we always do
Rihanna songs, and do we always

19:26.830 --> 19:28.330
agree with everything
that she says and does?

19:28.381 --> 19:29.582
Are we saying that it's okay

19:29.616 --> 19:31.133
to go back to somebody
that abuses you?

19:31.167 --> 19:32.635
No, we're not.

19:32.669 --> 19:34.303
Look, all I am saying
is that I think

19:34.337 --> 19:35.504
that we should be able
to separate

19:35.555 --> 19:37.723
the art from the artist.

19:37.757 --> 19:40.342
Well, I don't think you should, and
personally, I can't listen to his music

19:40.393 --> 19:42.344
without thinking about
the horrible person behind it.

19:42.395 --> 19:43.562
I agree,

19:43.597 --> 19:44.930
and if there was a list
of people's music

19:44.964 --> 19:46.148
that we should never do
in this room,

19:46.182 --> 19:47.349
Chris Brown would be at the top

19:47.400 --> 19:49.235
of that list.
And unfortunately,

19:49.269 --> 19:50.236
we live in a democracy,

19:50.270 --> 19:51.904
so we can't force you
to do anything.

19:51.938 --> 19:53.805
We just really think
you should think about it.

19:55.025 --> 19:57.309
Chris Brown's a total
powder keg, dude.

20:02.815 --> 20:04.199
No peeking.

20:04.251 --> 20:06.619
And...
Oh.

20:06.653 --> 20:08.587
I'm peeking.
Peek, peek, peek, peek, peek.

20:08.622 --> 20:10.372
Oh, my God.

20:10.423 --> 20:12.007
Kurt, you gave my boyfriend
pillow a sex change.

20:12.042 --> 20:14.043
That's so sweet.

20:14.094 --> 20:15.094
A little perfume and voilà.

20:15.128 --> 20:17.179
If you ever tell anyone
about this,

20:17.213 --> 20:19.632
I have no ethical problems
with Hummel-cide.

20:21.968 --> 20:23.936
You don't seem as excited
about yours.

20:23.970 --> 20:25.771
This is weird,

20:25.805 --> 20:27.022
and I'm not lonely.

20:27.057 --> 20:29.141
Okay, I don't need
anything to cuddle with.

20:29.175 --> 20:30.309
Just 'cause Brody moved out
doesn't mean

20:30.343 --> 20:31.443
that we're not gonna
get back together.

20:31.478 --> 20:33.312
Okay, no.

20:33.346 --> 20:34.563
What?

20:34.614 --> 20:35.948
I'm sorry.

20:35.982 --> 20:38.233
It is over,
and it's gonna stay over.

20:38.285 --> 20:40.202
I was wrong Brody
being a drug dealer,

20:40.236 --> 20:42.288
but I was just wrong
about what he was selling.

20:42.322 --> 20:44.123
Your boyfriend
wasn't a caterwaiter,

20:44.157 --> 20:45.741
he was gigolo.

20:45.792 --> 20:46.959
Like Magic Mike

20:46.993 --> 20:49.745
with happy endings for money.

20:49.796 --> 20:51.497
That's not true, right?

20:51.531 --> 20:53.215
You didn't... you
didn't know about that.

20:53.249 --> 20:54.466
It's not true, right?

20:56.252 --> 20:59.204
Right?

21:02.142 --> 21:03.175
You're welcome.

21:05.545 --> 21:06.512
Why did you have to do that?

21:06.546 --> 21:09.047
It was for her own good.

about exactly, Blaine?

24:01.604 --> 24:04.356
Shut it. Uh, it was
about Kurt, obviously.

24:04.390 --> 24:06.525
That breakup's still
a fresh wound.

24:06.559 --> 24:07.776
But it's really about
the musical genius

24:07.827 --> 24:11.663
of Phil Collins, and like
any musician of his time,

24:11.698 --> 24:13.782
when you dominate that period
with such success,

24:13.833 --> 24:16.535
people tend to make fun
of you and put them down,

24:16.569 --> 24:18.704
but the truth is he's
a musical legend, and I'm tired

24:18.738 --> 24:19.788
of people making fun of him.

24:19.839 --> 24:21.673
And I'm gonna dedicate
a good part of my future

24:21.708 --> 24:24.576
ensuring that his genius
is understood and appreciated.

24:26.579 --> 24:28.430
I am no longer in the closet

24:28.464 --> 24:30.749
about my love for Phil Collins.

24:33.686 --> 24:36.471
All right, everybody, give it up
for Blaine Anderson.

24:43.349 --> 24:46.151

great week so far, you guys,

24:46.202 --> 24:47.402

how did it feel to be so open

27:01.537 --> 27:02.504
about your Spice love?

27:02.538 --> 27:03.788
Liberating.

27:03.839 --> 27:06.875
We only hope you can see us
for who we really are.

27:06.909 --> 27:11.262
I applaud your courage in such
an openly Spice-phobic time.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.099
Especially you, Kitty...
actually I don't think I've

27:14.133 --> 27:16.134
ever seen you so, uh...

27:16.185 --> 27:18.219
uh...
So what?

27:20.255 --> 27:21.806
Happy to be part of the team.

27:21.857 --> 27:24.059

my girl is spicy!

27:24.093 --> 27:25.810

27:25.861 --> 27:28.113

just fantastic.

Cheese and rice,
you scared me, Tina.

29:50.239 --> 29:51.237
My name is Vicki,

29:51.264 --> 29:52.121
I am an android.

29:52.135 --> 29:53.469
I'm fantastic.

29:53.503 --> 29:55.454
Made of plastic.
She's Vicki the robot girl

29:55.472 --> 29:56.672
from <i>Small Wonder.</i>

29:56.723 --> 29:58.223
The TV cult classic.
<i>Small Wonder</i>

29:58.258 --> 30:01.226
has made me the woman I am
today, free to speak my mind

30:01.261 --> 30:03.178
and think outside the box.
Good afternoon, Jake.

30:03.229 --> 30:04.763
Hey, Vicki.

30:04.797 --> 30:06.465
That's it... I've reached
my guilty pleasures

30:06.483 --> 30:08.183
obscure-reference-that-
nobody-cares-about limit.

30:08.234 --> 30:10.185
I've got to go talk
to some normal people.

30:10.236 --> 30:11.970
I'm out of here.
Wait, wait, hold on.

30:11.988 --> 30:13.856
I need to apologize first, okay?

30:13.907 --> 30:15.858
I didn't know about
the Bobby Brown thing.

30:15.909 --> 30:18.110
You do realize that

30:18.144 --> 30:19.945
Bobby Brown allegedly

30:19.979 --> 30:22.314
got Whitney Houston
hooked on crack, right?

30:22.332 --> 30:23.949
Let me get this straight.

30:23.983 --> 30:25.951
You know about
Vicki the robot girl,

30:25.985 --> 30:27.819
but you didn't know
about Bobby and Whitney?

30:29.155 --> 30:30.205
I'm out of here.

30:30.256 --> 30:32.157
I will follow you.
No, go away.

30:32.175 --> 30:34.209
Stop.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.211
Hey, okay?

30:36.262 --> 30:39.014
So, this week has
made me kind of crazy.

30:39.049 --> 30:40.999
And I get why we don't
support Chris Brown.

30:41.017 --> 30:43.018
But, I mean, does
it really matter

30:43.053 --> 30:45.020
what a couple of
high school kids think?

30:45.055 --> 30:46.972
Maybe not.

30:47.006 --> 30:51.026
But every ocean starts with
one drop of water, right?

30:53.179 --> 30:55.180
I sound like my grandma.

30:58.184 --> 31:01.904
Hey... so are we okay?

31:01.955 --> 31:05.357
You know, I have
a guilty pleasure

31:05.375 --> 31:07.025
I haven't told you about.

31:07.043 --> 31:08.744
Please don't say me 'cause
that would be very cheesy.

31:08.795 --> 31:10.162
Oh, my God.

31:10.196 --> 31:12.381
Actually it's anything
starring Jessica Simpson.

31:15.919 --> 31:17.886
But...

31:17.921 --> 31:19.922
now that you mention it.

31:35.822 --> 31:37.106
Hey.

31:39.909 --> 31:42.027
What's this?

31:42.061 --> 31:43.996
I was hoping that I could have
dinner with you tonight.

31:45.231 --> 31:47.065
I'm sorry, is it not enough?

31:47.083 --> 31:48.917
I wasn't sure what the going
rate was these days

31:48.952 --> 31:50.702
for male hookers.

31:50.736 --> 31:52.737
Don't judge me.
Oh, really?

31:52.755 --> 31:53.956
For selling your body?

31:54.007 --> 31:55.740
Not everybody has
doting daddies

31:55.758 --> 31:56.741
to pay their bills.

31:58.845 --> 32:01.096
I'm such an idiot.

32:01.131 --> 32:03.432
I'm such an idiot.

32:03.466 --> 32:06.435
You told me
that if we were honest

32:06.469 --> 32:09.138
with each other
that anything was possible.

32:09.189 --> 32:10.973
Why did you lie to me?

32:11.024 --> 32:12.141
Why did you lie to me?

32:12.192 --> 32:13.225
When did I lie to you?

32:13.259 --> 32:14.560
Who do you think
did this to my face?

32:14.594 --> 32:16.428
Your ex-fiancé.

32:16.446 --> 32:19.264
He jumped out of a bathroom,
went all Frankenstein on me.

32:23.036 --> 32:25.454
Finn came all the way here
to do that?

32:25.488 --> 32:26.905
Yeah.

32:26.939 --> 32:30.075
And who's the liar now?

32:30.109 --> 32:32.161
I know you still love him.

32:33.463 --> 32:35.947
And I know that you slept
with him at that wedding.

32:38.134 --> 32:39.968
Did Santana tell you that?

32:40.003 --> 32:42.971
No one had to tell me.

32:44.290 --> 32:47.476
Look, I'm sorry that
I lied about all

32:47.510 --> 32:49.294
that stuff, okay,
but I meant everything

32:49.312 --> 32:51.630
that I ever said about
how I feel about you.

32:57.654 --> 33:00.239
You're right,
I haven't been, uh...

33:02.358 --> 33:04.860
...completely honest with you.

33:06.312 --> 33:08.664
I think that there
was a part of me

33:08.698 --> 33:11.867
that was... using this.

33:14.087 --> 33:18.006
Partly to make Finn
jealous and, um,

33:18.041 --> 33:21.043
the other part to just...

33:21.094 --> 33:24.263
fill my own personal heartache.

33:30.336 --> 33:32.837
So, what, this is...

33:32.855 --> 33:34.856
it's just over?

33:40.396 --> 33:41.863
Yeah, uh...

33:43.182 --> 33:45.984
...it feels like it is.

33:49.355 --> 33:51.373

I wanted to do one more Phil
Collins song before they made us

36:46.705 --> 36:48.923
put our guilty pleasures
back in the closet.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.708
Well, maybe we don't have to.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.009
I mean, everybody
seems to be having

36:52.044 --> 36:53.577
so much fun with them
out on the table.

36:53.595 --> 36:55.579
Maybe life's just
better this way.

36:55.597 --> 36:57.348
I don't know about that.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.016
I think if we always
indulged ourselves

36:59.051 --> 37:00.251
in that kind of thing,
I think we'd make

37:00.285 --> 37:01.686
a lot of people
pretty uncomfortable.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.971
You don't have to
be uncomfortable.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.525
Dude, it's okay.
I-I get it.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.426
Your...

37:09.444 --> 37:10.561
your guilty pleasure is me.

37:10.595 --> 37:12.429
Um...

37:12.447 --> 37:14.264
I mean, I-I've known all
year, and you know, frankly,

37:14.282 --> 37:16.400
I'm an attractive
guy, and you are

37:16.434 --> 37:18.452
into dudes, and if you weren't

37:18.487 --> 37:20.571
into me, I'd probably
be pretty offended.

37:22.441 --> 37:25.459
Hm-hm, um... you're...

37:25.494 --> 37:27.712
not freaked out?

37:27.746 --> 37:30.131
Because... I don't want
to jeopardize our friendship.

37:30.165 --> 37:32.083
I mean, you've been there for me Dude.
Okay. Just stop.

37:32.117 --> 37:33.300
Throughout this whole Kurt thing...
Nothing's gonna change.

37:33.335 --> 37:35.285
Stop. Nothing is
going to change.

37:35.303 --> 37:36.470
Oh.

37:36.505 --> 37:38.255
Okay? We're like...
we're like brothers.

37:38.289 --> 37:40.224
I trust you,

37:40.258 --> 37:42.593
and you know, to
tell you the truth,

37:42.627 --> 37:45.312
the attention feels
kind of... kind of good.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.148
It-It's flattering.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.465
Hug it out.
Let's go.

37:50.402 --> 37:51.936
Come on.
Hug it out.

37:53.689 --> 37:55.606
Oh.

38:00.478 --> 38:01.912
Um...

38:01.947 --> 38:03.480
Dude, um...

38:03.498 --> 38:05.449
please tell me that that is only

38:05.483 --> 38:06.817
a pack of Life Savers
in your pocket.

38:06.835 --> 38:08.836
Oh, yeah, no,
they're breath mints.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.337
Oh.
Do you want one?

38:10.372 --> 38:11.956
Uh, yeah, sure.

38:11.990 --> 38:12.957
All right.

38:12.991 --> 38:14.592
Mm, thanks.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.593
All right.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.461
Let's go lead one more class.

38:17.495 --> 38:19.597
I have a song that everyone's
gonna love, so...

38:19.631 --> 38:21.348
Wait up.

38:23.385 --> 38:24.501
This... this is crazy.

38:24.519 --> 38:25.836
This show is like crack.

38:25.854 --> 38:27.838
I cannot believe this
was on regular TV.

38:27.856 --> 38:29.840
I thought you'd like this
<i>Facts of Life</i> marathon.

38:29.858 --> 38:32.009
Thank God I recorded
six months of it on the DVR.

38:32.027 --> 38:33.778
Thank you, TV Land!

38:33.812 --> 38:34.945
Okay, so please tell me

38:34.980 --> 38:36.513
that the chick on
this motorcycle

38:36.531 --> 38:38.616
and that super bitch get
together in the end.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.785
They do not, but...

38:40.819 --> 38:42.620
George Clooney joins
the cast later No way.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.788
As the handyman
with a heart of gold.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.372
Oh, I love those guys.

38:45.407 --> 38:47.792
And a mullet.
Okay, we have to turn this into

38:47.826 --> 38:49.660
a musical so that
I can play Jo.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.328
Can I be Blair,
and we can do a duet?

38:51.362 --> 38:52.696
Oh...

38:52.714 --> 38:54.131
Well,
that depends on

38:54.166 --> 38:57.051
what, uh, happened with you
and the American Psycho.

38:57.085 --> 38:59.870
Yeah, we had a-a pretty mature

38:59.888 --> 39:02.006
and honest conversation.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.674
You know, we decided that

39:03.708 --> 39:05.559
we're obviously gonna
be professional,

39:05.594 --> 39:07.478
because we're gonna see
each other all the time,

39:07.512 --> 39:08.729
and be in each other's
lives because we go

39:08.764 --> 39:10.514
to the same school.

39:10.548 --> 39:11.682
But, um...

39:11.716 --> 39:14.652
but yeah, it's... it's over.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.071
For real.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.941
And, you know,
I really have you to thank.

39:22.694 --> 39:23.661
Because you didn't give up,

39:23.695 --> 39:25.529
and you really were trying

39:25.563 --> 39:26.747
to make me see, and...

39:26.782 --> 39:29.083
I-I appreciate you

39:29.117 --> 39:31.669
getting Finn to come
and defend my honor.

39:31.703 --> 39:32.753
I know that was you,

39:32.788 --> 39:34.672
so...

39:34.706 --> 39:35.906
I swear I will never

39:35.924 --> 39:39.576
doubt your Mexican psychic
third eye ever again.

39:47.803 --> 39:50.254
Why the long face?
You've got a hot

39:50.272 --> 39:51.889
boyfriend pillow
in there named Colin.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.891
I named him Colin after
the non-threatening boy

39:53.925 --> 39:55.609
in <i>The Secret Garden,</i>
'cause I know you loved it.

39:57.813 --> 39:59.763
Don't be sad.

40:01.650 --> 40:02.783
I'm not.
