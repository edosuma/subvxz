03:00.340 --> 03:02.040
That's mine.

03:03.942 --> 03:06.079
Well, I saw it first, shithead.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.518
Well, actually,
the deer's mine.

03:12.552 --> 03:14.886
And you two shitheads
are trespassing.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.289
Come on, Rayburn.

03:16.322 --> 03:17.956
You ain't going to miss
one buck.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.292
It's a goddamn zoo
around here.

03:19.325 --> 03:20.926
Well, that's the point.

03:20.959 --> 03:22.861
This is a sanctuary,
you dumbshit.

03:22.894 --> 03:24.297
Now, put down your rifles.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.498
Okay.

03:27.066 --> 03:30.303
Rayburn Swanson
is a goddamn tree hugger.

03:30.336 --> 03:32.071
Who'd have thought?

03:32.105 --> 03:33.306
Well, people change.

03:34.574 --> 03:36.142
No, they don't.

03:47.919 --> 03:49.955
You can pick up
your guns later.

03:49.988 --> 03:51.790
Don't let me catch you
here again, all right?

04:16.048 --> 04:18.517
Don't suppose you boys
could give me a jump?

05:08.067 --> 05:09.335
Hey, Thor.

05:12.338 --> 05:14.340
How you doing, huh?
Are you tired?

05:20.313 --> 05:22.181
Any more activity?

05:28.388 --> 05:30.490
Weren't you supposed
to do the dishes?

05:39.298 --> 05:43.136
<i>A defunct paper
mill on Sawbill Reservation</i>

05:43.169 --> 05:45.937
<i>is now ground zero
for the war on drugs.</i>

05:45.971 --> 05:47.973
<i>The locals call it
the Factory.</i>

05:48.006 --> 05:51.344
<i>Sawbill Nation unanimously
voted last night</i>

05:51.377 --> 05:54.213
<i>to condemn the old paper mill
next month.</i>

05:54.247 --> 05:56.716
<i>Karl Blackhawk
is with the tribal police</i>

05:56.749 --> 05:59.419
<i>and has been working
diligently...</i>

06:12.231 --> 06:13.633
Where'd you find him this time?

06:13.666 --> 06:15.168
Over at the Factory.

06:15.201 --> 06:18.003
Attracts trouble
from all sides, Alice.

06:18.036 --> 06:22.408
Trying to clean that place up,
but... losing battle, I guess.

06:22.442 --> 06:25.010
He's got blood on him.

06:25.043 --> 06:26.479
What happened?

06:26.512 --> 06:28.080
According to him, nothin'.

06:28.114 --> 06:29.449
Just tripped.

06:29.482 --> 06:32.218
Any trouble around town
last night?

06:32.251 --> 06:34.019
Don't recall a time
there wasn't, Alice.

06:34.053 --> 06:36.021
Anything involving him?

06:36.055 --> 06:37.457
Not that I know of.

06:37.490 --> 06:39.392
But I wouldn't, uh...

06:39.425 --> 06:40.760
I wouldn't bet on it.

06:40.793 --> 06:42.395
Thanks, Karl.
I'll take him home.

06:42.428 --> 06:44.029
Mm-hm.

06:44.063 --> 06:46.232
I can't keep doing you favors,
Alice.

06:46.265 --> 06:48.534
Sooner or later your brother's
gonna get caught up in something

06:48.568 --> 06:50.403
you won't be able
to get him out of.

06:55.441 --> 06:57.276
Come on. Get out.

07:08.721 --> 07:11.123
What were you doing in that
place last night, Brooks?

07:12.725 --> 07:14.293
None of your business.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.129
You still taking your meds?

07:17.163 --> 07:18.531
Every day.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.633
Can you...?

07:20.666 --> 07:22.368
Can you stop that, please?

07:26.539 --> 07:28.708
Whose blood is that
on your shirt?

07:28.741 --> 07:30.776
Mostly mine.

07:32.445 --> 07:34.313
Sam Moonblood
beat the shit out of me.

07:34.347 --> 07:36.816
What? Why?

07:36.849 --> 07:38.551
A woman.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.353
Why don't you take
the back roads?

07:40.386 --> 07:41.754
What woman, Brooks?

07:45.091 --> 07:48.261
You have any idea
what Moonblood does?

07:48.294 --> 07:50.530
Whatever it is, it's outside
of my jurisdiction.

07:50.563 --> 07:54.700
Him and that creepy fuck Olsen,
they push it all.

07:54.734 --> 07:56.769
Drugs. Gambling.

07:58.571 --> 08:00.473
Whoring.

08:00.506 --> 08:02.141
Were you paying for sex?

08:02.174 --> 08:03.676
Nah.

08:03.709 --> 08:06.712
She wasn't a hooker.

08:06.746 --> 08:09.382
Can you just turn around
and take a different way home?

08:09.415 --> 08:10.850
- No, I need to go this way.
- I don't want to go this way.

08:10.883 --> 08:12.618
I gotta go this way,
I gotta do something.

08:12.652 --> 08:15.221
I don't want to go this
fucking way! Just turn around!

08:16.355 --> 08:18.090
Oh, shit, I...

08:18.124 --> 08:21.527
Shit, I'm sorry, Brooks. I...

08:21.561 --> 08:22.728
I wasn't thinking.

08:42.615 --> 08:44.517
Still think you're cut out
for this?

08:46.686 --> 08:48.654
Don't think I forgot
what day it is.

08:48.688 --> 08:50.756
I'm gonna come by
the motel later.

08:52.525 --> 08:54.360
I'm not sure I'll be around.

08:54.393 --> 08:56.195
Well, I'm gonna
come by anyway.

08:56.228 --> 08:58.197
<i>Unit one-three-one.</i>

08:58.230 --> 09:00.132
Go for one-three-one.

09:00.166 --> 09:03.369
<i>We've got a possible homicide
out on Buck Lake.</i>

09:04.837 --> 09:07.173
Ten-four. I'm on my way.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.255
Oh, shit.

09:26.759 --> 09:28.361
Hey, kids.

09:28.394 --> 09:29.695
Thank you for having us,
Mr. Swanson.

09:29.729 --> 09:31.430
This is a real treat
for the students.

09:31.464 --> 09:33.933
Well, my pleasure, ma'am.

09:33.966 --> 09:35.868
Are you intoxicated?

09:35.901 --> 09:38.304
Don't worry,
the kids won't notice.

09:40.439 --> 09:43.809
Welcome to the Gwen Swanson
Wildlife Sanctuary.

09:43.843 --> 09:45.711
Now, who knows
what a sanctuary is?

09:46.779 --> 09:48.848
No one?

09:48.881 --> 09:53.586
Well, it's a place where no
trapping or hunting's allowed.

09:53.619 --> 09:57.323
A safe haven for animals.

09:57.356 --> 09:58.758
You see this area here?

09:58.791 --> 10:01.560
Look, almost 50 square miles.

10:01.594 --> 10:03.596
That's my sanctuary.

10:03.629 --> 10:07.333
My dad said you've killed
more animals than anyone.

10:07.366 --> 10:09.735
Used some real nasty traps too.

10:11.904 --> 10:14.440
Done my share.
like everyone else around here.

10:15.675 --> 10:17.309
But I stopped all that.

10:17.343 --> 10:19.345
Why?

10:19.378 --> 10:21.447
My daughter didn't like it.

10:21.480 --> 10:25.317
So now, instead of trapping
animals for their fur,

10:25.351 --> 10:28.320
I use humane traps
to catch the problem ones,

10:28.354 --> 10:30.322
and then I release them here,

10:30.356 --> 10:32.425
where they can live
without human threat.

10:34.894 --> 10:37.697
Now, every now and then I...

10:39.031 --> 10:41.734
I do snare kids...

10:44.470 --> 10:45.771
...when they talk out of turn.

10:56.549 --> 10:57.917
Can you turn her over?

11:05.591 --> 11:07.727
The body was dumped
postmortem in the water,

11:07.760 --> 11:09.462
probably a good week ago.

11:13.332 --> 11:15.801
What do you think this about?

11:15.835 --> 11:19.238
Well, I'm not sure,
but I'll make a note.

11:37.957 --> 11:39.592
Get forensics up here.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.444
Sheriff!

12:07.419 --> 12:09.555
You think whoever killed her
was hunting her for sport?

12:11.423 --> 12:13.492
I wouldn't call that a sport,
but, yeah.

12:14.627 --> 12:15.761
She was hunted.

12:17.763 --> 12:19.899
Somebody get a saw
and cut this out.

14:06.639 --> 14:08.774
Jesus. You pregnant?

14:12.212 --> 14:14.013
Aren't you a bit old
for that?

14:14.046 --> 14:16.216
Still have no manners,
huh, Rayburn?

14:16.249 --> 14:18.951
Still got no personality,
eh, Blackhawk?

14:18.984 --> 14:21.221
Got something to talk to you
about.

14:21.254 --> 14:24.657
Well, you better
come inside then.

14:25.858 --> 14:27.127
Not you.

14:32.731 --> 14:36.669
I missed you.
Oh, I missed you.

14:36.702 --> 14:38.204
I don't suppose
you and Blackhawk came here

14:38.238 --> 14:40.073
to pass out cigars.

14:41.507 --> 14:42.942
Uh...

14:47.046 --> 14:50.683
Karl and me want to hold
a funeral for Gwen.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.989
You know, five years
is a long time, Ray.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.194
I don't want to do this
without you.

15:02.594 --> 15:04.230
She's my daughter too.

15:04.264 --> 15:06.066
I know.

15:06.099 --> 15:09.001
I got a say in this,
and I say no.

15:09.034 --> 15:11.537
Ray, don't make this harder.

15:11.570 --> 15:14.207
Well, you can't replace Gwen
with Blackhawk's fuckin' baby.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.842
Hey!
That's not fair.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.911
You think you're the only one
who misses her?

15:26.752 --> 15:28.821
After everything that's
happened, you're still drinking?

15:28.854 --> 15:29.989
Oh, shut up.

15:36.996 --> 15:39.132
It's just a formality.

15:39.165 --> 15:42.034
Just sign it and the court'll issue
an official death certificate.

15:46.206 --> 15:49.242
Listen, we bought a plot,
and it's a really nice place.

15:56.882 --> 15:58.584
Funeral's in two weeks.

16:11.730 --> 16:13.799
Come in.

16:13.832 --> 16:16.602
Wasn't easy,
but we got it out.

16:19.105 --> 16:21.840
You know, there's plenty
of people happy you're sheriff.

16:21.874 --> 16:23.575
You can't please everybody.

16:25.778 --> 16:27.213
Thanks, Hansen.

17:19.964 --> 17:22.202
<i>This just in, breaking news.</i>

17:22.234 --> 17:25.904
<i>We're here at a crime scene
by Buckridge and Echo Falls.</i>

17:25.938 --> 17:28.874
<i>Looks like there is a body
of a young woman here,</i>

17:28.907 --> 17:31.677
<i>and the identity
has not been revealed.</i>

17:31.710 --> 17:33.745
<i>We're trying to get some
interviews with the police,</i>

17:33.779 --> 17:36.748
<i>but it looks like they're
getting ready to move the body.</i>

17:36.782 --> 17:38.418
<i>We'll update you more live</i>

17:38.451 --> 17:40.420
<i>as information
becomes available.</i>

17:40.453 --> 17:42.020
<i>For now, back to you.</i>

17:53.366 --> 17:55.767
You didn't have
to get me anything.

17:55.801 --> 17:57.604
Mm. It's not much.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.874
Where'd you find this?

18:03.709 --> 18:06.246
It was in the storage box
in the attic.

18:10.716 --> 18:12.017
Dad looks so young.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.729
We should, um...

18:25.931 --> 18:29.269
we should talk about what
happened to you in the barn.

18:29.302 --> 18:30.969
No.

18:36.041 --> 18:39.179
I should have adopted you
when Mom and Dad died.

18:39.212 --> 18:42.148
I should have taken you
to Chicago with me.

18:42.182 --> 18:45.017
You didn't know nothin'
about raising a kid.

18:45.051 --> 18:47.920
Yeah, well, I knew more
than those fucking people.

18:58.797 --> 18:59.998
Hey, Alice?

19:01.934 --> 19:04.103
Yeah?

19:04.137 --> 19:07.739
If I messed up and did something
bad, what would you do?

19:07.773 --> 19:09.409
What are you talking about?

19:11.344 --> 19:15.415
If I fucked up and did something
stupid, would you help me out?

19:21.054 --> 19:22.322
Sheriff?

19:24.324 --> 19:26.092
Hold on a sec, all right?

19:30.230 --> 19:32.098
I'm Rayburn Swanson.

19:32.131 --> 19:33.932
I know who you are.
What do you want?

19:33.966 --> 19:36.269
I was told at the station
I could find you here.

19:36.302 --> 19:39.539
I need to see that girl.
She could be my daughter.

19:39.572 --> 19:41.274
I'm kind of in the middle
of something...

19:41.307 --> 19:43.176
Please.

19:45.844 --> 19:48.348
All right, well, we'll finish
this when I get back, okay?

20:01.494 --> 20:02.894
Well?

20:06.099 --> 20:07.567
No.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.934
No.

20:14.906 --> 20:16.342
Fuck.

20:16.376 --> 20:18.211
I saw your brother earlier.

20:18.244 --> 20:20.280
Someone sure did
a number on him.

20:20.313 --> 20:22.448
Hope he didn't give you
any trouble.

20:22.482 --> 20:25.084
I got to be honest,
he has some bad habits.

20:25.118 --> 20:27.086
Some? Jesus Christ.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.887
You know what gets me the most?
Those knuckles.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.456
- Those knuckles fuckin' kill me.
- Yeah.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.525
That and he went through
a six-pack while I examined him.

20:32.558 --> 20:34.926
Just? It's usually a case.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.429
Oh. Doctor,

20:36.462 --> 20:40.099
<i>do you know much about Rayburn?</i>

20:41.900 --> 20:43.169
Do you have kids?

20:43.202 --> 20:45.171
No.

20:45.204 --> 20:47.407
Then you can't begin to imagine
what he's gone through.

21:04.557 --> 21:06.192
Can I join you?

21:08.461 --> 21:10.962
Sure.

21:13.899 --> 21:15.335
Hey, Pete.

21:15.368 --> 21:16.868
Hey, Alice. Long time.

21:18.638 --> 21:21.441
I remember hearing about the
disappearance of your daughter.

21:23.076 --> 21:25.877
Things like that didn't happen
around here.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.547
Yeah, the world's
a shitty place.

21:28.980 --> 21:30.483
It can be.

21:30.516 --> 21:32.418
Well, it was for that girl
you found today.

21:34.654 --> 21:36.955
I've only been sheriff
a couple of months.

21:38.324 --> 21:39.958
I'm still catching up
on active cases.

21:39.991 --> 21:43.995
Yeah, my daughter's case
is far from active.

21:46.132 --> 21:48.534
My training is very different
from the officers around here.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.269
Yeah, I heard.
What do you want?

21:53.239 --> 21:55.174
A chance to prove...

21:55.208 --> 21:57.042
The chance of solving
a missing persons case

21:57.076 --> 21:59.479
after 48 hours is almost zero.

21:59.512 --> 22:03.082
What do you think the chances
are after five goddamn years?

22:03.116 --> 22:05.984
Or didn't they teach you that
in your fancy college?

22:11.324 --> 22:12.658
I'm going to take a leak.

22:12.692 --> 22:14.926
You gonna be here
when I come back?

22:14.960 --> 22:16.596
- You need me to be?
- Not really.

22:16.629 --> 22:19.565
Don't hesitate to call, Rayburn.

22:19.599 --> 22:22.168
- I'm here to help.
- I don't got a phone.

22:55.701 --> 22:57.170
Quiet, Thor.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.710
You ain't getting shit unless
I see something in those...

23:06.279 --> 23:07.680
What the hell?

23:07.713 --> 23:09.348
Thor.

23:29.135 --> 23:31.270
Son of a bitch.

24:11.377 --> 24:13.813
I know you're there, pal.

24:13.846 --> 24:16.082
Just want to talk,
that's all.

24:23.523 --> 24:25.791
This is a sanctuary.

24:25.825 --> 24:27.393
You can't hunt here.

24:43.109 --> 24:45.144
Don't be getting stupid.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.328
Come on.

26:56.976 --> 26:58.477
Oh...

27:48.894 --> 27:50.730
Okay, asshole.

27:50.763 --> 27:52.431
What were you tracking?

30:48.941 --> 30:50.643
Whatever it is,
I'm innocent.

30:50.676 --> 30:52.845
Oh, there's nothing innocent
about you, Jim.

30:55.148 --> 30:56.916
Your parents
would be proud.

30:59.785 --> 31:00.920
Thanks.

31:02.554 --> 31:03.923
You have a minute?

31:03.956 --> 31:05.457
Sure.

31:06.792 --> 31:08.460
You hear about that girl

31:08.494 --> 31:09.995
they found dead
in the boundary waters?

31:10.029 --> 31:12.098
Yeah, you betcha.
Horrible thing.

31:12.132 --> 31:14.967
Was she really hunted,
like the papers said?

31:20.240 --> 31:22.441
What do you think he used?

31:26.578 --> 31:28.981
World's oldest weapon
delivery system.

31:29.014 --> 31:30.582
It's called an atlatl.

31:30.616 --> 31:32.885
Developed over
30,000 years ago.

31:32.918 --> 31:34.820
And people still use these
for hunting?

31:34.853 --> 31:36.722
Maybe some real die-hards,
but it ain't legal.

31:38.924 --> 31:41.194
Clearly you're not
a suspect.

31:41.227 --> 31:42.828
Hold your horses.

31:44.630 --> 31:47.733
A well-made atlatl
can deliver a spear

31:47.766 --> 31:49.635
over 100 miles an hour.

31:52.604 --> 31:55.040
- Jesus.
- Ain't no toy.

31:55.075 --> 31:57.077
It was designed to kill.

31:57.110 --> 31:59.578
Do any members
use an atlatl?

31:59.611 --> 32:01.747
- Not that I know of.
- Where could you buy one?

32:01.780 --> 32:04.217
Well, you're not going to find
it at Walmart, that's for sure.

32:04.250 --> 32:07.153
There's a local fella
you could probably start with.

32:07.187 --> 32:09.155
Sam Moonblood's his name.

32:09.189 --> 32:11.291
Hangs at the Factory
over in Sawbill.

32:11.324 --> 32:14.194
Makes 'em... and he sells 'em.

32:15.627 --> 32:17.596
Thanks.

32:17.629 --> 32:21.000
Careful, Alice,
when you pay him a visit.

32:21.033 --> 32:22.935
He's not too friendly
to your kind.

32:22.968 --> 32:24.903
Women? Or cops?

32:26.005 --> 32:27.207
Both.

33:17.656 --> 33:18.991
Hey.

34:21.987 --> 34:23.922
Yo, bitch! What you want?

34:36.069 --> 34:37.735
You lost...

34:37.768 --> 34:39.737
or looking for your brother?

34:41.274 --> 34:43.007
I have some questions.

34:43.041 --> 34:45.411
That badge don't mean shit
out here, lady.

34:45.445 --> 34:47.280
Is Sam Moonblood around?

34:47.313 --> 34:49.014
He's probably huntin'.

34:49.047 --> 34:50.250
Oh, yeah? Whereabouts?

34:50.283 --> 34:53.119
Shut your cock-hole, Patty.

34:54.387 --> 34:56.822
Does Sam Moonblood use atlatls
when he hunts?

34:56.855 --> 34:58.391
What are you getting at?

35:00.293 --> 35:02.794
We hear things out here too,
you know.

35:02.828 --> 35:05.265
Sam's a lot of things...

35:05.298 --> 35:06.832
but he ain't a killer.

35:09.034 --> 35:11.837
You tell Sam Moonblood
I'm looking for him.

35:11.870 --> 35:14.174
Fucking dick.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.069
Oh, shit.

35:45.238 --> 35:48.208
Moonblood has a place
over in Sawbill.

35:48.241 --> 35:49.908
You'll find him there.

35:49.942 --> 35:51.977
Thank you, Patty.

35:53.946 --> 35:55.415
Look after yourself.

37:31.444 --> 37:33.179
What the...

37:35.315 --> 37:37.283
Hey. Hey.

37:39.152 --> 37:40.286
Hey.

37:43.556 --> 37:46.125
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

37:46.159 --> 37:48.361
Hey, hey, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

37:48.394 --> 37:50.430
I'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

37:50.463 --> 37:52.365
Listen to me, okay?

37:52.398 --> 37:54.334
Let me help you.

37:54.367 --> 37:56.102
I want to help you.

37:56.135 --> 37:57.403
Okay?

37:57.437 --> 37:58.904
Let me show you.

37:58.937 --> 38:00.239
Please.

38:03.909 --> 38:07.213
It's gonna be a lot warmer
down there out of the wind.

38:07.246 --> 38:09.981
We don't go down there,
we'll freeze.

38:11.317 --> 38:13.052
Please.

38:13.086 --> 38:14.986
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

38:34.674 --> 38:36.041
Here.

38:36.075 --> 38:37.410
Hold this.

38:37.443 --> 38:39.010
Shit.

38:41.481 --> 38:43.048
Goddamn it.

38:44.450 --> 38:46.052
Oh, come on.

38:46.085 --> 38:47.919
No, no, no, no, no.

38:47.953 --> 38:49.955
Oh, no, you got
to be kid...

38:49.988 --> 38:53.092
Oh, no. Shit!

38:53.126 --> 38:55.428
My whiskey.

39:05.036 --> 39:07.440
My ex-wife used to call me
abrasive.

39:09.375 --> 39:11.677
I think I understand
what she meant now.

39:13.479 --> 39:15.081
I'm sorry.

39:18.016 --> 39:19.685
This is a pitfall.

39:19.719 --> 39:21.287
For trapping animals.

39:26.692 --> 39:28.960
This is a real
nasty way to go.

39:28.994 --> 39:31.397
There's a few of these
old traps around,

39:31.431 --> 39:33.266
but I don't use 'em anymore.

39:45.144 --> 39:46.412
Okay...

39:48.314 --> 39:50.616
I'm just going
to put these on you, okay?

39:57.723 --> 40:00.092
Okay, there you go.

40:01.794 --> 40:04.363
Can you talk?

40:06.165 --> 40:07.433
No.

40:07.467 --> 40:09.068
My name's Rayburn.

40:16.375 --> 40:18.244
M...

40:18.277 --> 40:19.412
O...

40:21.481 --> 40:24.217
Molly. Molly.

40:25.685 --> 40:27.753
It's nice to know you, Molly.

40:30.490 --> 40:32.692
Do you know
who that man is?

40:34.227 --> 40:35.595
No?

40:42.235 --> 40:44.237
Try and get
some sleep, okay?

40:44.270 --> 40:46.205
We got a long walk
tomorrow.

40:58.751 --> 41:00.653
It's going to be okay.

41:23.409 --> 41:25.278
Sam Moonblood?

43:21.694 --> 43:23.696
- Freeze!
- Whoa, easy!

43:23.729 --> 43:25.665
It's me, Alice.

43:25.698 --> 43:27.600
Holy shit.

43:31.671 --> 43:33.739
Followed you
and called you in.

43:33.773 --> 43:35.941
Jesus Christ.
Breaking and entering?

43:35.975 --> 43:37.443
It was an urgent matter.

43:37.476 --> 43:38.844
Yeah, well, you need
a warrant, Sheriff.

43:38.878 --> 43:40.513
Probable cause.

43:40.546 --> 43:41.914
Moonblood's tracks
are all over this.

43:41.947 --> 43:43.749
We know that the suspect
used an atlatl,

43:43.783 --> 43:45.685
and he has atlatls
in his fucking basement,

43:45.718 --> 43:48.320
and the spearhead
has an MB on it.

43:48.354 --> 43:50.756
And no one knows
where the hell he is.

43:50.790 --> 43:53.292
Does your brother
own an atlatl?

43:57.363 --> 43:58.764
Young girl missing.

43:58.798 --> 44:00.966
Now, the mother hangs out
at the Factory.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.470
Said she got in an altercation
a few nights back with a man

44:04.503 --> 44:06.238
she named Brooks.

44:07.473 --> 44:10.309
- What are you trying to say?
- He was getting handsy with her.

44:10.342 --> 44:12.445
He wouldn't leave,
so Sam Moonblood tossed him out.

44:12.478 --> 44:14.380
My brother would never
kidnap a young girl.

44:16.615 --> 44:19.318
We never know as much
as we think we do, Alice.

44:19.351 --> 44:20.953
Now, I know your brother
went through some hard times

44:20.986 --> 44:22.722
after your parents passed...

44:22.755 --> 44:25.257
There's nothing wrong
with my brother.

44:25.291 --> 44:27.827
- Then bring him in.
- Are you forgetting who the sheriff is?

44:27.860 --> 44:30.529
There is no sheriff here.

44:30.563 --> 44:32.898
This is Sawbill nation.

44:41.540 --> 44:43.409
We make quite a pair, kid.

44:47.713 --> 44:49.982
My place is southwest of here,

44:50.015 --> 44:53.018
probably six miles.

45:22.414 --> 45:24.550
Hey. Hey, it's me.

45:25.818 --> 45:26.952
Brooks?

46:09.129 --> 46:10.663
I need a break.

46:25.778 --> 46:27.046
It's not much further.

46:31.817 --> 46:33.552
I need a drink.

46:42.995 --> 46:45.898
I bet your mom and dad
will be real happy to see you.

46:52.138 --> 46:55.407
I lost my daughter too.

46:57.009 --> 46:58.577
On my watch.

47:01.147 --> 47:04.150
You know what?
You might...

47:04.184 --> 47:05.851
maybe...

47:05.885 --> 47:07.453
yeah.

47:10.723 --> 47:11.824
Open it.

47:24.870 --> 47:26.405
You recognize her?

47:41.054 --> 47:42.155
Let's go.

47:49.795 --> 47:51.630
<i>Sheriff, copy a call.</i>

47:51.664 --> 47:53.565
<i>My brothers are complaining</i>

47:53.599 --> 47:55.467
<i>Rayburn Swanson confiscated
their rifles.</i>

47:55.501 --> 47:57.036
<i>Can you go check it out?</i>

48:24.164 --> 48:25.564
Take a seat.

48:40.313 --> 48:42.182
Let me get you some water.

48:50.123 --> 48:52.058
Thor?

49:42.375 --> 49:43.909
Who are you?

49:43.942 --> 49:45.544
Who are you?

51:11.864 --> 51:14.167
Rayburn?

51:14.200 --> 51:16.902
Rayburn,
it's Sheriff Gustafson.

51:16.935 --> 51:20.073
I'm here about
those guns you took.

51:20.106 --> 51:22.040
Do you have a moment to talk?

51:42.861 --> 51:44.130
Put your gun down!

51:44.164 --> 51:46.199
I said put your gun down!

51:46.232 --> 51:48.901
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Put your gun down, goddamn it!

51:48.934 --> 51:50.869
- He's still here. He's here!
- What have you done?

51:50.903 --> 51:52.804
- What have you done?
- What? No, no, no, no, no!

51:52.838 --> 51:55.974
- What have you done?
- Sheriff! Behind you, behind you!

51:56.008 --> 51:57.809
Drop your weapon!

51:57.843 --> 51:59.445
Drop your weapon
and get on your knees!

51:59.479 --> 52:01.214
Now!

52:01.247 --> 52:02.714
Do it now!

52:06.486 --> 52:09.721
- Oh, my God.
- Put your hands on your head, now!

52:12.858 --> 52:14.060
Sheriff.

52:15.794 --> 52:18.064
This man,
he hunted this girl.

52:24.836 --> 52:26.306
You got to be careful.

52:28.807 --> 52:30.143
Sheriff.

52:32.811 --> 52:34.746
Sheriff.

52:36.316 --> 52:38.117
Oh! Oh!

52:42.155 --> 52:43.989
Go, Brooks.

52:44.022 --> 52:45.225
Go home.

52:56.369 --> 52:57.803
Rayburn?

54:03.035 --> 54:04.537
Help!

54:07.073 --> 54:10.008
Hello? Hello?

54:10.042 --> 54:12.844
<i>This is dispatch.
Identify, please.</i>

54:12.878 --> 54:17.049
I need an ambulance at
Rayburn Swanson's immediately.

54:19.185 --> 54:21.454
A girl is hurt real bad.

54:21.487 --> 54:22.921
Rayburn Swanson's.

54:35.368 --> 54:36.602
Karl.

54:42.141 --> 54:44.042
Ray?

54:44.077 --> 54:45.278
What happened?

54:45.311 --> 54:47.146
It's Gustafson.

54:47.180 --> 54:48.348
She fucking shot me.

54:48.381 --> 54:50.616
What? Why?

54:50.650 --> 54:53.152
She's protecting Brooks.

54:53.186 --> 54:54.354
He did it.

54:55.555 --> 54:57.390
We need to get you
to a hospital.

54:57.423 --> 55:01.194
No, no, no.
They'll be looking for me.

55:01.227 --> 55:04.630
I need checkpoints on every road
in and out of this county.

55:04.664 --> 55:06.965
- You hear me?
- Yes. She's coming with you.

55:23.249 --> 55:25.618
What the fuck have I done?

55:28.688 --> 55:30.356
<i>All units, all units.</i>

55:30.390 --> 55:33.126
<i>Be on the lookout
for Rayburn Swanson.</i>

55:35.428 --> 55:36.629
It's okay, just hold on.

55:36.662 --> 55:38.398
No.

55:38.431 --> 55:40.233
Hold on,
we're going to be there soon.

55:40.266 --> 55:41.667
Hang in there, buddy.

55:43.302 --> 55:44.670
I'm sorry.

55:47.173 --> 55:48.341
What?

55:48.374 --> 55:50.309
You're not too old...

55:51.477 --> 55:53.044
to be a mother again.

55:53.079 --> 55:54.180
You deserve it.

55:55.681 --> 55:57.183
I'm sorry I wasn't
a better father.

55:57.216 --> 55:59.218
Just stop. It's okay.

56:01.554 --> 56:03.189
And, Karl,
you're a good man.

56:04.990 --> 56:07.460
You're just saying that because
you think you're dying.

56:07.493 --> 56:09.328
Don't worry, we can go back
to hating each other

56:09.362 --> 56:11.364
after you're all stitched up.

56:23.342 --> 56:25.077
Thanks for coming, Doctor.
I appreciate it.

56:25.111 --> 56:27.513
- Where is he?
- He's over here.

56:27.547 --> 56:29.148
Jesus.

56:31.049 --> 56:33.519
It's the best I could do, doc.

56:36.489 --> 56:38.057
Okay, this is it.

56:38.090 --> 56:40.226
He's here.
This is Dr. Boone.

56:40.259 --> 56:42.195
We met at the morgue.

56:42.228 --> 56:44.297
I hope you don't plan
on taking me there, Doc.

56:44.330 --> 56:46.132
What in the hell
did you get yourself into?

56:46.165 --> 56:48.434
I came across
the wrong kind of man.

56:48.468 --> 56:50.203
Or woman, I guess.

56:50.236 --> 56:52.003
He needs a hospital,
not a fucking RV.

56:52.037 --> 56:54.005
I have emergency supplies,
including blood bags.

56:54.039 --> 56:55.141
Please?

56:56.742 --> 56:58.511
We have no choice, Doc.

56:58.544 --> 57:00.112
I'll see what I can do.

57:00.146 --> 57:01.581
I need some space.

57:01.614 --> 57:03.216
Okay. Yeah.

57:03.249 --> 57:04.517
Okay.

57:19.765 --> 57:21.267
He'll be okay,
all right?

57:21.300 --> 57:22.535
Okay.

57:25.605 --> 57:27.173
Do me a favor,

57:27.206 --> 57:29.609
go back to the car
and lock the doors, okay?

57:29.642 --> 57:31.143
Be careful.

57:36.749 --> 57:38.251
Yeah, this is Blackhawk.

57:38.284 --> 57:40.219
I need backup
at the Factory right now.

57:50.096 --> 57:51.364
Hey.

57:53.099 --> 57:54.300
Can I get some?

57:57.203 --> 57:58.604
Brooks!

57:58.638 --> 58:00.540
Hey, come here!

58:02.174 --> 58:03.709
Brooks! Hey!

58:20.393 --> 58:21.494
Brooks!

58:22.595 --> 58:23.796
Brooks! Stop!

58:31.771 --> 58:33.439
Get back
or I'll fucking kill him.

58:33.472 --> 58:35.741
- Okay. Stay calm.
- Move the cars or I'll kill him.

58:35.775 --> 58:39.211
Hey, take it easy, Brooks.
Let's just think this thing through here.

58:39.245 --> 58:40.713
This isn't just my fault, okay?

58:40.746 --> 58:42.148
I didn't start any of it!

58:42.181 --> 58:43.616
Hey, I understand.

58:43.649 --> 58:45.685
But you have the power
to put an end to this.

58:45.718 --> 58:48.654
So why don't you just put that
down and we'll talk, okay?

58:48.688 --> 58:51.324
Brooks, we're just trying to help
Rayburn here. He's seriously hurt.

58:51.357 --> 58:53.125
You can help him
when we're on the road, okay?

58:53.159 --> 58:54.393
Just move the cars...

58:54.427 --> 58:57.563
Come here.

58:57.597 --> 58:59.432
Put your hands
behind your back.

58:59.465 --> 59:01.601
Hey, hey, hey. Easy. Easy.

59:09.875 --> 59:12.178
Did they find Rayburn?

59:12.211 --> 59:13.646
Your brother's
been arrested.

59:27.426 --> 59:28.728
Hey.

59:28.761 --> 59:30.563
- Where is he?
- Take it easy.

59:30.596 --> 59:31.864
I want to talk to him.

59:31.897 --> 59:33.566
Where is he?

59:33.599 --> 59:36.302
Did you shoot
Rayburn Swanson?

59:37.737 --> 59:40.706
That is an ongoing investigation
in my county.

59:40.740 --> 59:42.908
It has nothing
to do with you.

59:42.942 --> 59:45.911
I want to talk to my fucking
brother, goddamn it.

59:45.945 --> 59:49.582
No. This is not
your county, Alice.

59:49.615 --> 59:51.917
Now, your brother
wants to come clean.

59:51.951 --> 59:53.786
Says he has something
to show us.

01:00:15.808 --> 01:00:17.476
Over there.

01:00:35.361 --> 01:00:36.829
Shit.

01:00:38.531 --> 01:00:40.266
Call a paramedic.

01:00:52.712 --> 01:00:55.448
- <i>Who is he?</i>
- <i>Sam Moonblood.</i>

01:00:55.481 --> 01:00:57.016
After the altercation
at the Factory,

01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:59.285
your brother jumped him
in the parking lot.

01:00:59.318 --> 01:01:01.620
Been keeping him here
ever since.

01:01:01.654 --> 01:01:04.690
Brooks says he doesn't know
anything about Molly Johnson.

01:01:04.724 --> 01:01:06.358
I believe him.

01:01:06.392 --> 01:01:09.328
Several eyewitnesses place him
at the Factory

01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:12.598
around the same time you
and Rayburn had your encounter.

01:01:12.631 --> 01:01:16.736
So whoever was out there
with you, it ain't Brooks.

01:01:18.437 --> 01:01:19.972
I'm going to recommend
you be placed on leave

01:01:20.005 --> 01:01:21.941
while you're investigated.

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:26.512
We got pics of this already.

01:01:38.557 --> 01:01:40.860
I'm sorry, Alice.

01:01:42.428 --> 01:01:43.562
I got angry.

01:01:44.997 --> 01:01:47.333
But I had nothing
to do with those girls.

01:01:51.871 --> 01:01:53.939
Hey.

01:01:53.973 --> 01:01:56.442
You know I came back for you?

01:01:58.410 --> 01:01:59.678
You know that, right?

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.456
Better go, Alice.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.382
Rayburn didn't kill
those girls.

01:02:40.553 --> 01:02:43.022
Well,
thanks for saving my life.

01:02:43.056 --> 01:02:45.457
I think
you saved mine too.

01:02:50.763 --> 01:02:52.464
They got him, right?

01:02:55.968 --> 01:02:57.436
What?

01:02:57.469 --> 01:02:59.038
Karl says it wasn't Brooks.

01:03:01.006 --> 01:03:03.076
He says the timelines
don't match.

01:05:01.061 --> 01:05:03.929
<i>Sheriff,
we got a call from Sawbill Reservation.</i>

01:05:03.963 --> 01:05:06.632
<i>Blackhawk wants to see you
at the Factory ASAP.</i>

01:05:06.665 --> 01:05:07.933
<i>Over and out.</i>

01:05:38.764 --> 01:05:41.201
Funny, Rayburn changed
his story.

01:05:41.234 --> 01:05:43.869
Said that it was the suspect
that must have shot him.

01:05:45.971 --> 01:05:47.906
We all make mistakes.

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.242
Yeah.

01:05:50.609 --> 01:05:52.212
Let me do the talking, okay?

01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:55.215
<i>We got one lead.</i>

01:05:55.248 --> 01:05:58.751
Whoever this guy is likely
bought an atlatl from you.

01:05:58.784 --> 01:06:02.921
I'm not the only one in America
who makes atlatls.

01:06:02.955 --> 01:06:05.958
Who you been selling to
in the past year or so?

01:06:05.991 --> 01:06:07.893
Can't be too many.

01:06:07.926 --> 01:06:10.130
Look...

01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:15.268
I'm really sorry about what
my brother did to you, okay?

01:06:15.301 --> 01:06:17.770
He's going to get
what's coming to him.

01:06:17.803 --> 01:06:20.939
But right now, there's someone
out there killing teenage girls,

01:06:20.973 --> 01:06:22.308
and we need you to talk to us.

01:06:27.046 --> 01:06:28.314
I don't got names.

01:06:28.348 --> 01:06:30.049
Only faces.

01:06:30.083 --> 01:06:31.617
I don't keep receipts,

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:33.786
'cause nobody
returns my atlatls.

01:06:33.819 --> 01:06:35.621
Now, if you got mug shots,
maybe I can help you,

01:06:35.654 --> 01:06:37.790
but if not,
you're shit out of luck.

01:06:48.901 --> 01:06:50.702
That's a good spear.

01:06:50.736 --> 01:06:52.072
It's made from pine.

01:06:52.105 --> 01:06:53.806
I only use birch.

01:06:53.839 --> 01:06:55.808
I don't mark my spears.

01:06:55.841 --> 01:06:58.010
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

01:07:02.415 --> 01:07:04.750
Thanks for your time.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.881
Can't go one day, Dad?

01:08:08.914 --> 01:08:11.049
I'm just going
to get a beer.

01:08:11.084 --> 01:08:13.186
Jesus, you're like
your mom.

01:08:13.219 --> 01:08:14.720
Should I be like you?

01:08:15.854 --> 01:08:17.390
I'll be right back, okay?

01:08:18.457 --> 01:08:20.260
I'm going to start walking.

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:23.462
Don't be stupid.

01:08:47.953 --> 01:08:50.022
Whiskey.

01:09:47.247 --> 01:09:48.981
She's gonna be okay?

01:09:49.014 --> 01:09:50.116
We're just
gonna keep an eye on her.

01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:52.017
Thank you.

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.813
Hi, Molly.

01:10:24.117 --> 01:10:26.486
We're going to get you
all better, I promise.

01:11:22.141 --> 01:11:24.544
No, I'm just here
to settle my debt.

01:12:34.647 --> 01:12:36.115
Hey!

01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:37.650
Can I help you?

01:12:37.683 --> 01:12:39.485
No.

01:12:39.519 --> 01:12:40.653
Nice truck.

01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:52.931
I need to see
the autopsy report.

01:14:45.411 --> 01:14:47.146
Sorry to bother you.

01:14:47.179 --> 01:14:48.614
Yeah?

01:14:50.583 --> 01:14:52.351
Is your son home?

01:14:52.385 --> 01:14:54.554
No one here but me.

01:14:56.222 --> 01:14:57.490
Well, it's just...

01:14:58.891 --> 01:15:01.561
last week this guy helped
jump-start my truck.

01:15:01.594 --> 01:15:03.663
I could've sworn this was
the truck he was driving.

01:15:03.696 --> 01:15:05.331
Just wanted to thank him.

01:15:05.364 --> 01:15:06.732
- Sorry about that.
- Oh.

01:15:06.766 --> 01:15:08.200
That would've been
my neighbor.

01:15:08.234 --> 01:15:09.769
He uses it sometimes.

01:15:10.803 --> 01:15:12.271
Lives up the hill there.

01:15:15.474 --> 01:15:17.176
Well, thank you, sir.

01:15:17.209 --> 01:15:18.411
You betcha.

01:17:49.528 --> 01:17:52.631
Dr. Boone left for the day,
but if you'd like to follow me,

01:17:52.665 --> 01:17:55.334
the autopsy report
should be in his office.

01:17:55.367 --> 01:17:56.869
Great.

01:17:56.902 --> 01:17:58.838
This can't be the file.

01:17:58.871 --> 01:18:00.940
It has none
of the photo evidence in it.

01:18:00.973 --> 01:18:02.641
Oh, I'll keep looking.

01:18:02.675 --> 01:18:04.009
Yeah, there have to be more.

01:18:10.883 --> 01:18:12.485
Who's this?

01:18:13.986 --> 01:18:16.422
Dr. Boone's daughter,
Melissa.

01:18:16.455 --> 01:18:17.757
Melissa.

01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:19.358
I didn't know
he had a daughter.

01:18:19.391 --> 01:18:21.594
Yeah, she was hit
by a drunk driver

01:18:21.627 --> 01:18:23.063
and left alone
in the forest to die.

01:18:23.096 --> 01:18:24.764
Poor girl.

01:18:24.797 --> 01:18:26.665
Melissa.

01:18:26.699 --> 01:18:28.868
Melissa Boone.

01:18:34.807 --> 01:18:36.408
Open it.

01:18:41.847 --> 01:18:43.048
Go upstairs.

01:18:44.650 --> 01:18:46.886
Hansen, with me.

01:18:53.726 --> 01:18:54.994
Call the paramedics.

01:18:55.027 --> 01:18:56.495
Jesus Christ.

01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:39.872
We got the APB out on Boone.

01:19:39.905 --> 01:19:41.540
You okay?

01:19:43.676 --> 01:19:45.477
I have to talk to Rayburn.

01:20:11.437 --> 01:20:12.671
Go.

01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:32.558
Rayburn?

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:35.461
Rayburn.

01:20:38.597 --> 01:20:40.032
I know who took Gwen.

01:22:32.278 --> 01:22:33.612
Rayburn.

01:22:35.881 --> 01:22:37.150
Rayburn.

01:23:55.661 --> 01:23:56.795
Why?

01:23:58.164 --> 01:23:59.965
Why Gwen?

01:23:59.998 --> 01:24:02.034
I was a good father.

01:24:02.068 --> 01:24:04.937
You were a drunk.

01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:07.039
She would've grown
into a fuckup,

01:24:07.073 --> 01:24:08.674
just like you.

01:24:09.975 --> 01:24:11.710
A drain on everyone.

01:24:13.979 --> 01:24:16.949
I only took the ones
that no one would miss.

01:24:41.107 --> 01:24:43.243
Rayburn, stop! Don't do it.

01:24:43.276 --> 01:24:44.810
Please.

01:24:49.082 --> 01:24:51.817
This man needs to die
for what he did to my daughter.

01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:53.353
Rayburn, don't do this.

01:24:53.386 --> 01:24:54.953
Don't do this.

01:24:54.987 --> 01:24:56.889
Let me take him in.

01:24:56.922 --> 01:24:59.092
Let him rot in jail.

01:25:01.894 --> 01:25:04.830
You want to talk to me
about right and wrong, Sheriff?

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.869
Now you can either walk away,
or you can shoot me again,

01:25:10.903 --> 01:25:13.739
but this ends now.

01:25:13.772 --> 01:25:15.175
Get up, get up.

01:25:15.208 --> 01:25:17.210
Goddamn it, Rayburn!

01:25:19.912 --> 01:25:22.215
I covered this trap years ago.

01:25:22.248 --> 01:25:24.484
Realized I didn't like
killing animals.

01:25:24.517 --> 01:25:26.286
Rayburn, please.

01:25:26.319 --> 01:25:28.221
I'll make an exception for you.

01:26:03.556 --> 01:26:07.260
You're going to let me die
like some animal?

01:26:10.028 --> 01:26:12.030
No.

01:26:12.065 --> 01:26:14.367
I would never leave
an animal suffering.

01:26:38.291 --> 01:26:40.193
Now we're even, Sheriff.

01:28:27.533 --> 01:28:29.068
<i>In local news,</i>

01:28:29.102 --> 01:28:30.636
<i>authorities are still searching</i>

01:28:30.670 --> 01:28:33.373
<i>for suspected serial killer
Dr. John Boone,</i>

01:28:33.406 --> 01:28:35.108
<i>whose last known whereabouts...</i>

01:28:35.141 --> 01:28:36.576
Don't worry, we'll get
this piece of shit.
