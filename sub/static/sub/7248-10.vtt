Previously on Gilmore Girls:

00:04.171 --> 00:07.591
- You have a formal coming up?
- Yeah, but I don't think I'm gonna go.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.092
Nonsense. Of course you're going.

00:09.176 --> 00:12.763
I just don't want you to miss on
any experience because you're too afraid.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.307
I'm afraid? Of what?

00:15.432 --> 00:17.059
Of asking Dean.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.144
Are you asking me
to go to a dance with you?

00:19.228 --> 00:20.270
No.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.522
Yes.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.816
- Bye, Grandma. Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.906
- What do you know about this boy?
- I know that Rory likes him...

00:30.989 --> 00:34.493
and that his parole officer has high hopes
for his rehabilitation.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.620
- Hey.
- What?

00:37.037 --> 00:40.999
- Thank you for tonight. It was perfect.
- You're welcome.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.797
- Lorelai, get up. Right now!
- What?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.131
Rory's not home.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.175
Have you been here all night?

00:50.259 --> 00:51.259
Oh, no.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.428
- Please let me come with you.
- No!

00:53.845 --> 00:55.013
I have to go home.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.349
Let's be calm
until we know what happened.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.684
They were out all night!

00:58.725 --> 01:01.061
- She'll get pregnant.
- No, she's not.

01:01.144 --> 01:04.438
She's smart and careful, and I trust her.
She's gonna be fine.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.943
If you can't accept or believe that,
then I don't want you in this house!

01:08.026 --> 01:11.655
Do you have any idea what it's like
to wake up with my mother here...

01:11.738 --> 01:13.699
and find out that you never came home?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.575
So all this is about Grandma being here?

01:15.659 --> 01:17.703
No, it's about
the feeling of complete terror...

01:17.786 --> 01:19.705
when you're not in bed in the morning!

01:19.746 --> 01:20.831
Nothing happened!

01:20.914 --> 01:22.708
It's a different terror when I find out...

01:22.749 --> 01:24.626
that you spent the night with some guy!

01:24.710 --> 01:27.337
I'm sorry that I screwed up,
and that you got yelled at...

01:27.421 --> 01:30.090
but I didn't do anything. And you know it!

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:39.057 --> 01:41.226
People, please pay attention!

01:41.309 --> 01:45.564
Now, I want my before Mary over here
and my after Mary over here.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.066
Wise men, shepherd,
line up for the processional.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.193
I only have half a donkey?

01:50.694 --> 01:52.904
I need the rest of the donkey.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.408
- Hold still, Kirk.
- You stuck me.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.993
- Did not.
- Did, too.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.828
Okay, be quiet now.

02:05.792 --> 02:09.253
Taylor, the Baby Jesus
is missing an arm again.

02:09.336 --> 02:10.380
What?

02:10.464 --> 02:13.175
- I was getting it out of the trunk and...
- Let me see that.

02:13.258 --> 02:17.345
For Pete's sake. Okay, listen up!
The arm is missing!

02:17.637 --> 02:19.639
I repeat, the arm is missing!

02:19.723 --> 02:23.351
Maybe it's time to get a new Baby Jesus.
One that's a boy.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.772
- It's a doll. No one can tell.
- It has a bow.

02:26.855 --> 02:31.526
This has been the Baby Jesus
in every Christmas Pageant since 1965.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.070
- Were you here in 1965?
- No, I wasn't.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.614
Find the arm.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.080
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.292
- You're flinching.
- You stuck me once and might do it again.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.211
You know what? You're done.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.132
- I swear, I've looked twice.
- Look again.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.842
Taylor, come quickly.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.553
Our before Mary's
about to become an after.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.931
Who else in town is knocked up?

03:14.694 --> 03:16.488
- Find the arm?
- Nope.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.748
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.895
- Hey, I thought we were meeting at Luke's.
- We were?

04:31.479 --> 04:33.982
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I forgot.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.027
Let me guess.
You and Lorelai haven't made up yet?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.194
Nope.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.031
Things are still very Miracle Worker
at my house.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.533
God, how did everything
get so screwed up?

04:43.616 --> 04:46.286
You staying out all night with Dean
had a part in it.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.913
And my grandmother being there
to witness it didn't help.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.874
- Never does.
- It sucks.

04:51.082 --> 04:54.252
Things were good.
School was good, Dean was good.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.255
Now my mother and I are barely speaking.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.507
Mom and Grandma are barely speaking.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.552
- Dean's new name is Narcolepsy Boy.
- How's he taking it?

05:02.635 --> 05:04.596
I haven't talked to him since it happened.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.890
- That's four days ago.
- I know.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.476
- Has he called?
- I told him not to.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.770
- And he listened?
- No.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.438
Good boy.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.900
I really need to talk about
something else now.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.277
- You went shopping.
- Yes, I did.

05:19.527 --> 05:22.155
I got a mooing cow-shaped timer
for Sookie...

05:22.197 --> 05:24.908
some Cardio Salsa tapes for Michel,
a book for Dean.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.243
- You got Dean a book?
- Yeah, Metamorphosis.

05:28.536 --> 05:29.579
It's Kafka.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.290
- Very romantic.
- I think it is romantic.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.959
I know I've always dreamed
that some guy would get me...

05:35.043 --> 05:37.128
a really confusing Czechoslovakian novel.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.713
I think he'll appreciate it.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.716
- A book sends the wrong message.
- What are you talking about?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.844
Look at what a gift says
to the other person, not to you.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.388
Remember two years ago,
I got my mom that perfume?

05:47.472 --> 05:49.098
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.811
To me that said, 'Mom, you work hard.
You deserve something fancy. '

05:52.894 --> 05:56.606
To my mother, it said,
'Mom, here's some smelly sex juice...

05:56.689 --> 05:58.233
'the kind I use to lure boys with. '

05:58.316 --> 06:00.818
And resulted in me being sent to
Bible camp all summer.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.821
- Yeah, but...
- Imagine that you actually gave Dean...

06:03.905 --> 06:07.200
something really romantic,
and he gave you a football.

06:07.283 --> 06:11.162
Your hypothetical romantic present
is saying that you really like him...

06:11.246 --> 06:13.873
and his present is saying,
'Let's just be friends. '

06:13.957 --> 06:18.169
- You're saying that this book...
- Is a Czechoslovakian football, yes.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.005
Then what do I get him?

06:21.089 --> 06:24.884
You should find out what he's giving you,
and then gauge your gift accordingly.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.011
But doesn't that take the fun out of it?

06:27.095 --> 06:28.888
Gift-giving is serious business.

06:28.972 --> 06:33.101
If you don't believe me, try spending
a month at Korean Bible Camp.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.688
Yes, right there.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.232
Now flip the elf and the fairy.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.235
- Which one's the fairy?
- The one with the wand.

06:42.318 --> 06:44.070
What are you doing?

06:44.195 --> 06:46.489
- Isn't this a wand?
- No, that is a staff.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.367
- This isn't a fairy?
- That is Little Bo Peep.

06:49.450 --> 06:52.870
- You don't wanna move her?
- I would prefer that you didn't.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.958
- So, we're still looking for a fairy.
- The search continues.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.462
- No chance you're gonna help me?
- None whatsoever.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.301
Independence Inn. Lorelai speaking.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.720
Mom, hello.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.306
I wanted to talk about
the Christmas dinner this Friday.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.224
- Christmas dinner.
- You forgot.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.435
There's been a lot going on around here.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.604
Your shindig's not high
on my list of things to obsess about.

07:18.688 --> 07:22.692
I'm sorry if the timing's bad, but the world
does not always revolve around you.

07:22.775 --> 07:23.943
Thanks for the tip.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.237
Cocktails are at 6:00. Dinner is at 8:00.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.698
- I probably won't be there for cocktails.
- Why not?

07:28.823 --> 07:31.784
- Because I have to work.
- You can't leave work early?

07:31.868 --> 07:33.244
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

07:33.328 --> 07:34.912
It's not in my job description.

07:35.204 --> 07:36.497
Then don't come.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.416
- What?
- Don't come.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.377
This is obviously
an enormous burden for you.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.713
- Yeah, but...
- Just send Rory.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.134
You're telling me not to come to
the Christmas party?

07:48.176 --> 07:49.677
You're obviously too busy.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.472
I had the German measles in fifth grade.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.807
I still had to show up
to the Christmas party.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.559
Let's be honest here.

07:56.642 --> 08:00.271
I'm not too happy with you right now,
and I assume you're not happy with me.

08:00.354 --> 08:04.776
My polka-dot dress matched my face,
and still I had to sit through 12 courses.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.071
I am tired of forcing you
to do all those terrible things...

08:08.154 --> 08:09.614
that infringe upon your life.

08:09.697 --> 08:12.992
And I do not have the energy to pretend
that the way you treated me...

08:13.034 --> 08:14.494
was in any way acceptable.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.662
So you're uninviting me
to Christmas dinner?

08:16.746 --> 08:18.039
Yes, I am.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.540
- Fine.
- Fine.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.043
- Anything else?
- I believe that's all.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.253
Great, Mom.
It's been swell talking to you.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.214
- Goodbye, Lorelai.
- Bye.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.302
- This one?
- No.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.144
I wish you'd change your mind.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.355
It's not my mind
that needs to be changed.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.774
- I don't think she meant it.
- She meant it.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.818
Maybe she thinks she meant it
at the time...

08:46.901 --> 08:49.529
but I bet she won't mean it
when I show up without you.

08:49.570 --> 08:53.366
Without a map to follow that reasoning,
I say, 'Take a hat, it's cold outside. '

08:53.407 --> 08:57.370
- You just wanna hold a grudge.
- Yes, it burns more calories.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.871
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.707
How do you think your grandma
got those legs of hers?

09:01.791 --> 09:04.210
She's not exactly a StairMaster gal.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.171
Never saw her on the running track.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.092
I don't remember the Country Club
organizing a Tae-Bo class.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.593
Fine, forget it.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.137
Should I put your name
on Grandma's present?

09:15.221 --> 09:18.891
Yes. Sign it 'The innkeeper
formerly known as her daughter. '

09:18.975 --> 09:21.143
- You know what I think?
- What?

09:21.227 --> 09:23.771
I think you're acting a little immature.

09:23.854 --> 09:24.897
I'm not acting.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.526
What about the apple tarts?
You wait all year for those apple tarts.

09:29.026 --> 09:31.529
I can live without the apple tarts.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.864
You've made up songs
after eating five of them...

09:33.948 --> 09:36.617
with lyrics that contradict
that last statement.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.412
- You have to go. You're late.
- You really won't come?

09:39.453 --> 09:42.790
Is somebody speaking? It couldn't be Rory.
She's halfway to Hartford.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.458
Fine, I'm going.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.212
Drive carefully. Watch out for ice.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.216
Bring me back one of those tarts.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.276
- Hi, Grandma.
- Rory, come in. You look lovely.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.111
This is from me and Mom.

10:12.194 --> 10:15.656
Aren't you thoughtful?
I'll just put it under the tree.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.783
Mom actually picked it out.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.661
- Do you know Holland Prescott?
- I met her last year.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.247
- Holland, look who's here.
- Hello, Rory.

10:23.539 --> 10:27.001
- That's not my proposal.
- Yes, I know. Henry toned it down a little.

10:27.084 --> 10:31.422
- Henry did? He is a toddler.
- He thought your take was conservative.

10:31.505 --> 10:34.717
- And a moron!
- Be very careful.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.969
This man may be our boss one day.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.555
- That will never happen.
- All right.

10:39.638 --> 10:40.765
Have you heard something?

10:40.848 --> 10:42.600
Richard, Alan, look who's here.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.143
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.187
- Where's your mother?
- She...

10:46.687 --> 10:50.316
- Over by the apple tarts, I assume.
- Lorelai couldn't come tonight.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.902
- She couldn't?
- No, she had to work.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.988
Speaking of which,
I'm gonna give that man a call.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.032
You're getting yourself all worked up.

10:58.115 --> 11:01.368
As long as I've been with this company,
it's been run by gentlemen.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.954
Revising a man's work
without so much as a phone call...

11:04.038 --> 11:06.832
- would have been unheard of.
- It's a new world out there.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.877
Please stop all this shoptalk.
We're here to celebrate.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.547
- I'm gonna call that man.
- It's past midnight in London.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.216
Even better.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.469
Grandma, could I talk to you
alone, please?

11:18.552 --> 11:20.012
You need something to drink.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.139
I wanna apologize about the other night.

11:22.223 --> 11:25.851
- Please, this is a party.
- I messed up. It's my fault.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.895
This isn't the time or place
to discuss this.

11:27.978 --> 11:30.856
- Your mother should've taught you that.
- Don't be mad at her.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.441
I'm not mad at anyone.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.276
Go back in and join the party.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.363
And take this to Gigi on your way back.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.661
Yes, Joe, I know it's Friday night,
but I ordered my pizza an hour ago.

11:43.744 --> 11:46.539
No, I did not hear about the delivery van.

11:48.916 --> 11:52.837
I am very sorry to hear that.
Was it a fairly new van?

11:54.129 --> 11:57.967
Great. As with most tragedies in life...

11:58.050 --> 12:00.719
there comes a time
when you need to pick up and move on.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.806
So what's the next phase
of the delivery saga?

12:08.310 --> 12:11.939
How long until your brother's back
with the Razor scooter?

12:15.359 --> 12:17.695
Just call me when he gets there.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.238
Bye, Joe.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.097
- Hi there. How you doing?
- Fine.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.850
Good. Shouldn't you have
a squeegee with you?

13:29.933 --> 13:32.436
- I was...
- Looking for Rory? She's not here.

13:32.519 --> 13:33.687
Okay.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.231
- I'll tell her you tapped.
- Thanks.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.736
Something else?

13:41.862 --> 13:44.031
I wanted to say
that things got all messed up.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.158
- Yes, they did.
- And I'm sorry.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.703
- But nothing happened.
- Okay, I have to go.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.247
We sat down,
and we were reading this book...

13:52.331 --> 13:53.916
and then we fell asleep.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.835
Pick a more interesting book next time.

14:00.255 --> 14:03.050
So am I public enemy number one
with you?

14:03.133 --> 14:05.135
Number one? I don't know.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.137
Would you settle for top five?

14:07.221 --> 14:10.974
I'm still hot for that crazy bomber guy
who's been living in a cave for a year.

14:11.058 --> 14:13.519
Please, just tell me where I stand.

14:13.727 --> 14:16.355
I don't know where you stand, okay?

14:16.397 --> 14:19.191
All I know is my 16-year-old
didn't come home one night.

14:19.274 --> 14:20.734
You had something to do with that.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.320
- I told you, nothing happened.
- I heard.

14:23.403 --> 14:25.823
You can hate me,
but you have to believe me.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.741
I wouldn't let anything happen to her.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.785
- You happened to her.
- I won't hurt her.

14:29.868 --> 14:33.163
- You know, I was 16 when I had Rory.
- I know.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.374
That is the same age she is now.

14:35.415 --> 14:36.834
She wants to go to Harvard.

14:36.917 --> 14:40.504
She will, and if she doesn't,
it won't be because of me.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.634
I don't hate you.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.262
- No?
- No.

14:48.762 --> 14:52.224
Though I did imagine 20 ways
to remove your head from your body.

14:54.309 --> 14:56.353
Which one looked the best?

14:56.436 --> 14:58.730
Hedge clippers. Dull ones.

14:58.772 --> 15:01.316
Sure, you wouldn't want it to go quick.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.609
Exactly.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.615
Okay, I'm gonna go.

15:12.786 --> 15:15.247
We have a really nice front door.

15:15.747 --> 15:18.125
You might wanna use it sometimes.

15:18.333 --> 15:19.543
Got it.

15:20.168 --> 15:21.420
See you.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.909
- Henry, you ring on three.
- I thought it was two.

15:52.075 --> 15:55.412
- Chuck rings on two. You ring on three.
- I'm on one.

15:55.746 --> 15:59.041
- Are you sure?
- Nope. Sorry, you're right. I'm two.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.627
From the top. One, two.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.849
- Rory coming?
- No.

16:15.932 --> 16:17.434
- She on a date?
- No.

16:17.517 --> 16:19.353
Good. So you forbid her
to see the bag boy.

16:19.436 --> 16:20.937
I'd rather not talk about it.

16:21.021 --> 16:24.733
- Just tell me you forbid her to see him.
- I did not.

16:24.816 --> 16:26.151
Are you crazy?

16:26.818 --> 16:29.821
He's moving up to produce,
so he's become quite a catch.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.865
- That kid is trouble.
- Can I order?

16:31.948 --> 16:33.700
First time I saw him, I thought that.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.119
I'm the one who told you
I thought he was trouble.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.454
You told me I was crazy.

16:37.537 --> 16:39.414
You are crazy, and he is trouble.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.376
He is not trouble.
He's 6'2', he's beautiful...

16:42.459 --> 16:44.169
and he's in love with my daughter.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.545
- Trouble.
- Big time.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.506
I'll get you a burger.

16:47.839 --> 16:48.924
Wait.

16:49.549 --> 16:50.634
Can I see a menu?

16:50.717 --> 16:52.469
- You need to see a menu?
- Yes.

16:52.552 --> 16:55.347
- You come here every day.
- But I usually order the same thing.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.516
Tonight I'm in the mood for
something different.

16:57.557 --> 17:00.060
- A menu.
- Piece of paper, list of food offered.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.187
Here.

17:07.150 --> 17:09.027
It's not in Japanese.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.656
Don't you have any kind of holiday special,
something festive?

17:12.739 --> 17:15.534
I just got some Grey Poupon. It's French.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.496
Tonight's my parents'
big Christmas celebration.

17:19.913 --> 17:23.791
There's good food,
these amazing apple tarts, big tree.

17:24.291 --> 17:28.130
It's the only holiday I actually enjoy
going over there for, and this year...

17:28.213 --> 17:29.256
I'm uninvited.

17:29.339 --> 17:32.175
Why would anybody
celebrate Christmas two weeks early?

17:32.259 --> 17:34.052
Did you hear that I was uninvited?

17:34.136 --> 17:36.138
To your parents' fake Christmas party?
I did.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.889
- Do you care?
- Obviously you do.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.100
Yes, I do. And I don't know why.

17:40.183 --> 17:42.727
You liked going,
Rory's there without you...

17:42.811 --> 17:44.896
you and Rory aren't getting along
right now...

17:44.980 --> 17:49.442
and you feel bad at being separated
at a time you usually share together.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.863
Did I mention you come here
every damn day?

17:53.029 --> 17:55.657
- I'll have a burger.
- Coming right up.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.039
Emily, you've outdone yourself yet again.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.835
Yes, I can't imagine the hours you spent
slaving over a hot stove.

18:06.918 --> 18:09.254
- You're teasing me, Alan.
- It's delicious.

18:09.337 --> 18:12.424
A compliment for my chef
is a compliment for me. Thank you.

18:12.507 --> 18:15.760
I, for one, would like to know
where Henry is at this hour.

18:15.844 --> 18:19.347
Probably gallivanting around London
like a bull out to stud.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.891
Richard, please.

18:21.474 --> 18:24.102
How's he supposed to negotiate
the contract tomorrow...

18:24.144 --> 18:26.646
if he's been out at all hours
with some cheap tramp?

18:26.730 --> 18:28.356
Knowing Henry, she wasn't cheap.

18:28.440 --> 18:32.277
This is wildly inappropriate dinner
conversation in front of a young lady.

18:32.319 --> 18:36.448
- Is it unbearably hot in here?
- Don't loosen your tie at the table.

18:36.531 --> 18:39.326
What are your plans
for the Christmas holidays, Rory?

18:39.409 --> 18:41.036
I'll just be hanging out with my mom.

18:41.119 --> 18:44.706
It's a shame she couldn't come.
She's always such a kick.

18:44.956 --> 18:48.543
Lorelai wasn't feeling well,
so I suggested she stay home.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.796
It is hot in here.
I'm gonna lower the thermostat.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.008
- Poor thing. What's wrong with her?
- She has a touch of the flu.

18:55.091 --> 18:58.845
- Forget the thermostat.
- I thought you said she was working.

18:59.012 --> 19:02.641
She was supposed to work,
but then she caught the flu.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.143
Tell her we missed her.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.269
I will.

19:08.271 --> 19:09.981
For heaven's sake.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.908
- What did you do?
- You wanted something festive.

19:19.991 --> 19:23.036
- You made me a Santa burger.
- It's no big deal.

19:23.119 --> 19:25.121
He has a hat and everything.

19:25.205 --> 19:27.165
Yeah, I just cut a piece of Wonder Bread...

19:27.248 --> 19:29.626
poured on some ketchup,
piped on some cream cheese.

19:29.709 --> 19:33.380
No one ever made me something
quite this disgusting before.

19:33.588 --> 19:35.131
- I thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.509
- What?
- Outside.

19:37.592 --> 19:40.762
- It's like the North Pole out there.
- This sign isn't a decoration.

19:40.845 --> 19:44.015
- Nothing in here is a decoration.
- It disturbs the other customers.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.434
Really? Maybe we should take a vote.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.604
Who thinks we shouldn't use
cell phones in here?

19:52.148 --> 19:53.733
Screw democracy.

19:54.859 --> 19:57.445
Perfect. Now I have to check my voicemail.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.323
What's going on?

20:00.407 --> 20:02.742
We were caroling around town
and we got chilly.

20:02.826 --> 20:05.704
We thought we could trade you a song
for some hot chocolate.

20:05.787 --> 20:09.040
- You want free hot chocolate?
- We'll sing for it, any tune you like.

20:09.082 --> 20:11.543
- And then I give you free hot chocolate?
- Yeah.

20:11.584 --> 20:13.628
You can have your hot chocolate,
pay for it...

20:13.712 --> 20:15.672
then go next door
and sing for marshmallows.

20:15.755 --> 20:17.757
- Oh, my God.
- These are your neighbors...

20:17.841 --> 20:19.551
Shut up, Taylor. What's going on?

20:19.592 --> 20:22.387
- My father's in the hospital.
- What?

20:22.429 --> 20:24.556
He collapsed or something. I don't know.

20:24.639 --> 20:27.434
I need to call a cab. Where's the phone?

20:28.143 --> 20:30.145
Can anybody give me...
I'm holding a phone.

20:30.228 --> 20:32.939
- Calm down.
- I can't. I need a cab.

20:33.022 --> 20:34.524
What's the number? God.

20:34.607 --> 20:39.112
It's something cabs, or cabs something.
1-800-CABS?

20:39.195 --> 20:41.573
Can somebody tell me
the damn number of the cab guy?

20:41.614 --> 20:42.615
I'll drive you.

20:42.699 --> 20:45.493
But there's food, and people,
and a burger with a face.

20:45.577 --> 20:49.747
Everybody out, we're closed.
Let's go! Food's on me.

20:49.873 --> 20:52.250
Put on your coat and get your stuff.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.086
Taylor, have your hot chocolate,
then lock up.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.380
Come on, my truck's out back.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.385
- Luke, I'm...
- I know. Let's go.

21:14.647 --> 21:15.773
- Look.
- Relax.

21:15.857 --> 21:19.152
- We're being passed by senior citizens.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

21:19.235 --> 21:20.486
Bye, Grandma.

21:20.570 --> 21:21.738
There's ice on the road.

21:21.821 --> 21:25.575
- Those people aren't being safe.
- At least they're getting somewhere.

21:25.658 --> 21:29.287
You've checked it five times.
I've listened to it twice. It's not changing.

21:29.329 --> 21:32.290
'Grandpa's in the hospital. Please come. '
No details, no info.

21:32.332 --> 21:35.418
- Who taught her to leave messages?
- I'm sure she was in a hurry.

21:35.501 --> 21:38.171
I need details.
Why is he in the hospital? How bad is it?

21:38.254 --> 21:41.841
What are the circumstances
involving him being in the hospital?

21:41.925 --> 21:44.385
We'll be there very soon,
and you'll know everything.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.304
- What if he's dead?
- He's not dead.

21:46.346 --> 21:47.639
- How do you know?
- I know.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.141
You're psychic now?
You're suddenly getting visions...

21:50.225 --> 21:53.978
while you drive at 20 miles an hour
in the oldest truck known to man?

21:54.687 --> 21:57.106
I'm sorry. You're killing yourself
to get me there...

21:57.190 --> 21:59.400
- and I'm yelling at you. I don't mean it.
- I know.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.569
I feel like this is one of those moments...

22:01.653 --> 22:05.823
where I should be remembering
all the great times I had with my dad.

22:06.699 --> 22:09.160
The time he took me shopping
for a Barbie...

22:09.202 --> 22:11.454
or to the circus, or fishing.

22:12.038 --> 22:15.333
- My mind is a complete blank.
- I'm sure it happened.

22:15.708 --> 22:17.460
No, it didn't. We never did any of that.

22:17.543 --> 22:20.088
He went to work, came home,
read the paper, went to bed.

22:20.171 --> 22:22.465
I snuck out the window. Simple.

22:22.548 --> 22:24.717
He was a very by-the-numbers guy.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.804
I was never very good with numbers.

22:28.179 --> 22:30.056
I'm sure he loves you.

22:32.266 --> 22:34.268
My dad is not a bad guy.

22:34.560 --> 22:35.895
I'm sure he's not.

22:35.979 --> 22:38.564
He lived his life the way
he thought he was supposed to.

22:38.648 --> 22:42.568
He followed the rules taught to him
by his non-fishing, non-Barbie-buying dad.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.153
He worked hard.

22:44.362 --> 22:47.407
He bought a nice house.
He provided for my mom.

22:47.490 --> 22:49.492
All he asked in return...

22:49.575 --> 22:52.662
was for his daughter
to wear white dresses and go to cotillion...

22:52.745 --> 22:55.206
and want the same life that he had.

22:55.707 --> 22:59.001
What a disappointment it must have been
for him to get me.

22:59.085 --> 23:02.004
I can't imagine anyone seeing you
as a disappointment.

23:02.088 --> 23:05.591
I bet you'd buy a Barbie for your daughter.

23:06.592 --> 23:09.387
I'd probably give her the cash
to buy it herself...

23:09.470 --> 23:11.639
and then meet her by the baseball cards.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.809
- You'll make a great dad.
- You make a great mom.

23:19.731 --> 23:24.068
It's just the daughter part
I don't have down yet.

23:27.905 --> 23:29.407
Okay, hold on.

23:30.199 --> 23:32.201
That Camaro is dust.

23:41.127 --> 23:43.588
- But why can't I see him?
- They're running some tests.

23:43.671 --> 23:46.382
- I'd like to meet the doctor.
- You will.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.259
Some strange man
is working on my husband.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.386
- I have a right to meet this person.
- You will.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.763
- I wanna see the room you'll put him in.
- You will.

23:52.805 --> 23:55.725
Stop saying, 'You will. '
Put a proper sentence together.

23:55.808 --> 23:58.186
Ma'am, please wait here.

24:02.482 --> 24:06.777
- Did you find out anything?
- Please. They run this place like the CIA.

24:08.362 --> 24:10.907
Joshua, thank God.
This place is infuriating.

24:10.990 --> 24:14.535
It's all right. I'm gonna check on him now.
Have you filled out the forms?

24:14.619 --> 24:16.787
I don't care about forms,
I wanna see my husband.

24:16.871 --> 24:18.623
- Is she being obstinate?
- Very.

24:18.706 --> 24:22.084
Let me see what's going on,
and we'll take it from there.

24:22.919 --> 24:25.296
And there he goes, through the doors.

24:25.379 --> 24:28.674
- Maybe I should call Mom again.
- Never mind, I'm sure she's very busy.

24:28.758 --> 24:31.802
- That's not true...
- Go get your grandfather a paper.

24:32.178 --> 24:33.971
The Wall Street Journal or Barron's.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.474
He'll want something to read
when he gets to his room.

24:36.557 --> 24:39.018
Okay, can I get you anything?
Maybe a coffee?

24:39.101 --> 24:40.811
No, dear, I'm fine.

24:59.872 --> 25:02.333
We're not here. Speak if you must.

25:13.928 --> 25:18.683
- Ms. Gilmore, I need you to...
- It's not Ms. Gilmore, it's Mrs. Gilmore.

25:19.475 --> 25:21.143
I am not a Cosmo woman.

25:21.227 --> 25:24.230
I know this is difficult,
but if you don't fill out these forms...

25:24.313 --> 25:25.856
You'll do what?

25:26.065 --> 25:28.401
I'd like to hear
in your most condescending tone...

25:28.484 --> 25:31.654
what my punishment will be
for not filling out these forms.

25:31.737 --> 25:35.908
Are there bamboo shoots involved?
Some dark, deep hole in the ground?

25:35.992 --> 25:37.702
Rats nibbling at my toes?

25:38.369 --> 25:42.206
Okay, we're supposed to follow
the blue line around the corner...

25:42.289 --> 25:44.291
and then we should be...

25:45.918 --> 25:47.753
Where's The Scarecrow
when you need him?

25:47.837 --> 25:51.799
- We have to ask someone else.
- No! We just have to pick one!

25:52.341 --> 25:54.885
We can't just
wander around here aimlessly.

25:54.969 --> 25:57.513
Somewhere in this hospital
are my mother and my father.

25:57.596 --> 25:59.265
I know I don't get along with them...

25:59.348 --> 26:02.351
but there has to be some sort of intuition,
some blood bond...

26:02.435 --> 26:04.937
- that will somehow lead me to them.
- That's crazy.

26:05.021 --> 26:08.024
- My great-uncle founded this hospital...
- And that's Emily.

26:08.107 --> 26:11.819
...you insensitive paper peddler!
His portrait is hanging in the lobby.

26:11.902 --> 26:14.363
It's right above the sign
that says 'Founder'!

26:17.616 --> 26:19.702
What's going on? How is he?

26:20.453 --> 26:21.662
You came.

26:21.746 --> 26:25.082
- Of course I came. How's Dad?
- That's what I'm trying to find out.

26:25.124 --> 26:28.002
But this woman keeps pestering me
with idiotic questions...

26:28.085 --> 26:30.588
like what's the number
of my insurance policy.

26:30.671 --> 26:34.216
- I need to get this information.
- You need to get sensitivity training.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.260
What if I fill out this information...

26:36.302 --> 26:38.971
and you can go find someone
who can tell us how my dad is?

26:39.054 --> 26:40.681
- I'm not...
- Or I can go...

26:40.765 --> 26:44.810
and you can stay here and continue
to discuss this with my mother.

26:46.979 --> 26:48.731
- I'll go.
- Thank you.

26:51.942 --> 26:55.112
- You got rid of her.
- Yes. Tell me what happened.

26:55.362 --> 26:57.198
- That was amazing.
- Mom, please.

26:57.281 --> 26:58.699
I don't know what happened.

26:58.783 --> 27:02.453
He was hot, and he went to turn down
the thermostat, and then...

27:02.495 --> 27:04.455
- Were you on a date?
- What?

27:04.497 --> 27:06.790
- You have an escort.
- No, it's Luke.

27:06.832 --> 27:09.251
Which is her way of saying
we weren't on a date.

27:09.335 --> 27:11.962
- I didn't mean it like that.
- How am I supposed to know?

27:12.004 --> 27:14.673
- It's Friday night. You're here with a man.
- With Luke.

27:14.757 --> 27:17.134
It's not insane to assume
a date was involved.

27:17.218 --> 27:20.930
You're right, it's entirely possible
that I was out on a date.

27:21.013 --> 27:22.014
Just not with me.

27:22.097 --> 27:25.643
I was eating at Luke's, I got the message.
He gave me a ride. End of story.

27:25.726 --> 27:28.020
- Is Dr. Reynolds here?
- Joshua got here a while ago.

27:28.103 --> 27:30.731
He was supposed to be back
the minute he knew something.

27:30.814 --> 27:31.815
Let's go find him.

27:31.899 --> 27:34.109
You can't find him. You can't find anyone.

27:34.151 --> 27:36.570
Everyone keeps disappearing
behind those doors.

27:36.654 --> 27:38.322
Come on, let's go.

27:41.825 --> 27:44.161
I didn't know you could do that.

27:44.370 --> 27:45.871
I'll wait here.

27:50.876 --> 27:53.837
I gave your mom a ride.
We weren't on a date.

27:54.797 --> 27:55.798
Okay.

27:55.881 --> 27:58.676
She and your grandmother went back
to find a doctor.

27:58.717 --> 28:00.719
Did they find out anything else
about Grandpa?

28:00.803 --> 28:03.681
I don't think so.
Give your mom some time back there.

28:03.722 --> 28:05.891
I bet she'll find something out.

28:05.975 --> 28:08.477
- Thanks for bringing her.
- You're welcome.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.853
You okay?

28:10.437 --> 28:14.316
- I don't want him to die.
- You tell him that when you see him.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.360
People like to hear that.

28:21.448 --> 28:24.285
It was horrible. It happened so fast.

28:24.660 --> 28:28.080
He'll come out of the testing room
any minute, so hang in there.

28:28.163 --> 28:29.331
Where's Grandma?

28:29.415 --> 28:31.959
Kicking some patient
out of the room with the good view.

28:32.042 --> 28:33.961
- Really?
- I hope they get him unhooked fast.

28:34.044 --> 28:36.380
Otherwise he'll go without
the life-support machine.

28:36.422 --> 28:39.174
- How long before they bring him back?
- Very soon.

28:39.216 --> 28:42.094
- I'd like to do something.
- Like rollerblade?

28:42.177 --> 28:45.055
Like get some coffee
or make phone calls...

28:45.097 --> 28:47.307
or do something
that isn't standing here waiting.

28:47.391 --> 28:50.102
Okay. As partial as I am to the phone...

28:50.185 --> 28:52.021
I'm voting for the get coffee idea.

28:52.104 --> 28:53.439
Okay, good.

28:53.647 --> 28:56.442
- Luke, tea?
- Peppermint, preferably.

28:56.525 --> 28:58.193
I'll be right back.

29:01.905 --> 29:03.615
He's gonna be fine.

29:03.782 --> 29:06.201
- I was just getting to know him.
- I know.

29:06.243 --> 29:08.579
- I don't want him to...
- He's not.

29:08.996 --> 29:10.748
Go get your coffee.

29:16.170 --> 29:18.797
- Oh, man.
- You were very brave for her.

29:20.257 --> 29:21.759
It's my turn.

29:22.259 --> 29:23.343
This sucks.

29:23.427 --> 29:25.262
Come on, you gotta think positive here.

29:25.345 --> 29:27.306
Bright side, good thoughts.

29:27.389 --> 29:29.141
Rainbows, unicorns.

29:30.267 --> 29:32.936
Clowns. Little, cute...

29:34.480 --> 29:35.731
furry...

29:35.939 --> 29:37.941
- Okay, I'm out.
- Thank God.

29:39.568 --> 29:41.570
We've secured him the room...

29:41.653 --> 29:43.906
but the pillows
are completely unacceptable.

29:43.989 --> 29:46.825
I'm gonna see if I can find some down ones
and some slippers.

29:46.909 --> 29:48.410
We'll be here.

29:51.705 --> 29:55.125
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm just not real big on hospitals.

29:55.167 --> 29:59.171
The smell, people being wheeled by
with tubes sticking out of them.

29:59.254 --> 30:01.131
Drainage fluids, gaping holes.

30:01.173 --> 30:04.468
- Listen, why don't you go home?
- You want me to go?

30:04.635 --> 30:06.553
- You don't look so good.
- Thanks.

30:06.637 --> 30:09.139
That's not what I meant.
You always look good.

30:09.223 --> 30:12.142
- Yeah?
- I meant you always look healthy.

30:12.226 --> 30:13.310
Okay.

30:13.393 --> 30:15.813
But you don't look so healthy now.
You look...

30:15.854 --> 30:16.939
- Unhealthy.
- Yes.

30:17.022 --> 30:18.106
Okay.

30:19.191 --> 30:20.359
What?

30:20.442 --> 30:23.320
So I said you look good.
We're not in fifth grade.

30:23.362 --> 30:25.405
'You look good. ' Big deal.

30:28.200 --> 30:29.910
Stop staring at me.

30:34.706 --> 30:37.501
See? That's what you get for being cocky.

30:45.884 --> 30:46.969
How is he?

30:47.052 --> 30:50.305
- He's a little groggy right now.
- What's going on? How were the tests?

30:50.347 --> 30:53.183
The doctor'll have to tell you that.
I'm just a transport guy.

30:53.267 --> 30:54.601
When is the doctor coming out?

30:54.685 --> 30:58.021
I'm not sure, but you can go on
with your dad until he gets here.

30:58.063 --> 30:59.982
- Go ahead. I'm good.
- That's okay.

31:00.065 --> 31:02.859
I'm gonna go find my mom and Rory
and tell them he's back.

31:02.943 --> 31:05.445
- I can tell them when they get here.
- That's okay.

31:05.529 --> 31:07.864
I think they'd like to know now.

31:08.031 --> 31:11.201
- You almost ran me over.
- Good thing we're in a hospital.

31:11.285 --> 31:13.954
- Where were you going?
- To find you. They brought Dad up.

31:14.037 --> 31:15.205
- When?
- Just now.

31:15.289 --> 31:18.375
- How is he? Did you talk to him?
- No, I was coming to find you.

31:18.458 --> 31:22.129
- Come on.
- Go ahead, I'm gonna go find Rory.

31:22.421 --> 31:23.463
- Fine.
- Okay.

31:23.547 --> 31:25.340
I could look for Rory.

31:25.382 --> 31:27.718
- No, that's okay. I'll do it.
- I thought so.

31:27.759 --> 31:29.344
Look, it's Rory.

31:29.428 --> 31:32.347
The coffee machine was jammed,
so I got chicken soup and PEZ.

31:32.389 --> 31:34.725
- I was coming to look for you.
- Is everything okay?

31:34.766 --> 31:37.561
They just brought Grandpa back up.
He's in Room 202.

31:37.644 --> 31:41.189
- Come on.
- You go ahead. I have to make a call.

31:41.690 --> 31:43.567
- Hurry up.
- I'll meet you there.

31:43.650 --> 31:45.402
- Who are you gonna go find now?
- Stop.

31:45.485 --> 31:47.404
How about Jimmy Hoffa?
That'll keep you busy.

31:47.487 --> 31:50.073
- Stop.
- You can't avoid going in there forever.

31:50.157 --> 31:52.367
I'm not avoiding anything.
I'm gonna find coffee.

31:52.409 --> 31:54.619
- The machine's jammed.
- There are other machines.

31:54.703 --> 31:58.040
- Admit you're afraid.
- You've no idea what you're talking about.

31:58.123 --> 31:59.750
- The truth hurts.
- You know what hurts?

31:59.833 --> 32:02.252
Having a screwdriver
jammed in the side of your head.

32:02.294 --> 32:03.378
What?

32:03.420 --> 32:04.796
Oh, my God!

32:07.966 --> 32:10.302
'Year-end optimism
in recent earnings reports...

32:10.385 --> 32:14.097
'have pushed shares of
the telecommunications giant above $65.'

32:14.848 --> 32:16.099
Rubbish.

32:16.141 --> 32:20.437
'However, some experts say
that the stock is dangerously overvalued. '

32:23.023 --> 32:24.191
How are we doing?

32:24.274 --> 32:26.777
We're done with the front page
of The Financial Times...

32:26.860 --> 32:30.322
- and all of The Wall Street Journal.
- Very good progress.

32:30.405 --> 32:33.116
Why don't you
save the rest of the paper till later?

32:33.200 --> 32:34.284
Okay.

32:36.828 --> 32:39.039
If I hug you is it gonna hurt?

32:39.122 --> 32:40.916
Pain is part of life.

32:45.796 --> 32:47.714
This little girl likes you.

32:47.798 --> 32:49.758
She has good taste.

32:55.722 --> 32:58.141
- Where's Mom?
- Looking for coffee.

32:58.266 --> 33:01.061
- What are you doing?
- Staring at my shoes.

33:01.770 --> 33:03.313
Okay, carry on.

33:08.276 --> 33:12.155
I finally found you decent pillows.
They're not down, but they give a little.

33:12.239 --> 33:14.908
- We need to talk.
- Can you lift your head at all?

33:14.991 --> 33:17.327
- This is serious.
- Just a little.

33:17.786 --> 33:21.665
There is a key in my top desk drawer.

33:21.832 --> 33:24.167
- Better, yes?
- It's to the safe.

33:24.251 --> 33:25.293
One more time.

33:25.377 --> 33:28.672
All of our stock information is in there...

33:28.713 --> 33:31.550
plus all of the insurance information.

33:32.175 --> 33:34.302
If I could just find you
some different sheets.

33:34.386 --> 33:38.181
Our will is in my lower left drawer.
Dennis has a copy if there's a problem.

33:38.265 --> 33:40.141
I could get Dava to bring some from home.

33:40.225 --> 33:42.727
Emily, this is serious.
We have to be practical.

33:42.811 --> 33:44.437
I'm gonna have Dava get those sheets.

33:44.521 --> 33:46.690
- Listen to me. If I die...
- No!

33:47.691 --> 33:51.152
Richard Gilmore, there may be
many things happening in this hospital...

33:51.236 --> 33:53.029
but your dying is not one of them.

33:53.071 --> 33:54.155
- But...
- No!

33:54.239 --> 33:57.492
I did not sign on to your dying,
and it is not going to happen.

33:57.534 --> 34:00.161
Not tonight, not for a very long time.

34:00.245 --> 34:02.497
In fact, I demand to go first.

34:02.831 --> 34:04.749
Do I make myself clear?

34:05.083 --> 34:06.459
Yes, Emily.

34:07.377 --> 34:09.045
You may go first.

34:09.545 --> 34:10.672
Good.

34:11.297 --> 34:13.341
I'm gonna get you those sheets.

34:25.853 --> 34:27.063
No luck?

34:27.355 --> 34:29.315
I think I'm wearing it down.

34:29.399 --> 34:31.025
You're pathetic.

34:32.569 --> 34:34.779
- Is the doctor back?
- Not yet.

34:36.197 --> 34:39.199
- You had a visitor tonight.
- Yeah? Who?

34:39.451 --> 34:41.953
- Narcolepsy Boy.
- Dean came over?

34:42.036 --> 34:43.163
Yeah.

34:43.246 --> 34:46.166
He pulled the old
tapping-on-the-window bit.

34:46.623 --> 34:49.668
- Were you mean?
- Excuse me, I am never mean.

34:49.753 --> 34:51.212
You were mean.

34:51.295 --> 34:53.757
- He told me nothing happened.
- Nothing did.

34:53.797 --> 34:56.217
- I know.
- You do? Really?

34:56.342 --> 35:00.680
There are only two things
that I totally trust in this entire world:

35:00.930 --> 35:04.267
The fact that I'll never be able to
understand what Charo is saying...

35:04.351 --> 35:07.103
no matter how long
she lives in this country...

35:07.187 --> 35:08.438
and you.

35:08.772 --> 35:10.190
Hopefully not in that order.

35:10.273 --> 35:13.401
You have to understand
the major panic factor that went on there.

35:13.485 --> 35:16.196
I really do, and I'm so sorry.

35:16.363 --> 35:18.907
Nothing like that will happen again,
I swear.

35:19.449 --> 35:21.284
- Don't swear.
- Why not?

35:21.326 --> 35:23.870
- Because you are your mother's daughter.
- Meaning?

35:23.953 --> 35:25.413
It means things can happen...

35:25.497 --> 35:27.832
even when you
don't really mean for them to happen.

35:27.916 --> 35:29.417
They will not happen.

35:30.502 --> 35:31.586
Okay.

35:32.295 --> 35:34.631
I hated going to that party tonight
without you.

35:34.714 --> 35:37.634
I hated you going to that party tonight
without me.

35:37.717 --> 35:41.471
- How were the apple tarts?
- Grandma didn't make them this year.

35:41.513 --> 35:43.014
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:43.098 --> 35:44.641
- That's weird.
- I know.

35:44.724 --> 35:46.267
- Are you lying?
- Through my teeth.

35:46.351 --> 35:47.435
Good girl.

35:52.607 --> 35:54.109
- Hello.
- Hi.

35:55.902 --> 35:59.989
- Lf you don't mind, I think I need to just...
- Sure. Sit, please.

36:01.658 --> 36:03.868
- How is he?
- You know, he's...

36:06.371 --> 36:07.831
I don't know.

36:10.083 --> 36:11.793
That's a nice tie.

36:12.168 --> 36:14.003
It's Brooks Brothers.

36:14.796 --> 36:16.840
It was bothering him tonight.

36:16.923 --> 36:20.468
I told him not to loosen it.
I wanted him to look nice for our guests.

36:20.552 --> 36:22.053
So he didn't.

36:22.846 --> 36:24.264
And then...

36:26.015 --> 36:29.060
The paramedics took it off him
on the way here.

36:29.143 --> 36:32.063
I just haven't been able to put it down yet.

36:33.398 --> 36:35.149
I must sound crazy.

36:36.693 --> 36:40.780
I've kept my father's entire store
just the way he left it.

36:41.739 --> 36:44.200
- Really?
- I turned it into a diner.

36:44.242 --> 36:48.788
But I kept all his stuff on the walls,
his pictures in the office.

36:49.163 --> 36:51.165
Even the Hardware sign.

36:51.583 --> 36:55.920
I'm sure he would've appreciated having
his life's work being honored like that.

36:56.004 --> 36:58.548
He would have called me a damn fool.

37:03.636 --> 37:06.556
I don't know what Lorelai's told you
about her father.

37:06.598 --> 37:08.641
I can certainly imagine...

37:09.601 --> 37:11.561
But he's a very good man.

37:12.061 --> 37:14.230
He always did the right thing
for his family.

37:14.272 --> 37:16.232
That's what she told me.

37:19.235 --> 37:22.363
What exactly is going on
between the two of you?

37:23.197 --> 37:24.407
Nothing.

37:25.158 --> 37:26.409
Really.

37:28.536 --> 37:30.538
We're friends, that's it.

37:31.789 --> 37:34.083
You're idiots, the both of you.

37:35.752 --> 37:38.421
- There you are. Where have you been?
- Coffee hunt.

37:38.504 --> 37:41.424
- What's going on?
- Your mother called me an idiot.

37:41.466 --> 37:43.217
You must've sucked up good.

37:43.259 --> 37:45.303
I'm gonna go wash my face.

37:55.647 --> 37:57.440
So what you gonna do?

38:02.278 --> 38:05.990
- Okay, I'm just gonna...
- I'll be here.

38:49.951 --> 38:53.579
...I've heard for such a long time.
How are you doing, darling?

38:54.956 --> 38:58.709
It looks like we're going to be
stuck with you for a while longer.

38:58.793 --> 39:00.419
It was just a touch of angina.

39:00.503 --> 39:03.422
- But you have to watch your diet.
- That's gonna be important.

39:03.506 --> 39:05.633
No more red meat, heavy desserts.

39:05.716 --> 39:09.345
- You're gonna have to exercise regularly.
- Golf doesn't count.

39:09.428 --> 39:10.513
Can he go home?

39:10.596 --> 39:13.182
We'd like to keep him overnight though,
just to be sure.

39:13.266 --> 39:16.811
- But he's fine.
- As long as he does what he's told, yes.

39:19.939 --> 39:22.108
I heard. Everything's okay.

39:22.191 --> 39:25.528
Yeah. They're gonna keep him overnight...

39:26.946 --> 39:28.865
but he's gonna be fine.

39:33.077 --> 39:35.413
Okay. See, here's where the guy...

39:35.496 --> 39:39.375
is supposed to give the girl
his handkerchief, but I don't have one.

39:39.458 --> 39:43.880
And plus, I find the practice
a little revolting, so...

39:44.338 --> 39:46.257
- I'm okay.
- You sure?

39:46.382 --> 39:48.009
- Yeah.
- All right.

39:48.384 --> 39:50.386
I got this for you.

39:51.178 --> 39:53.890
- Where did you get that?
- Nurses' lounge.

39:55.224 --> 39:58.144
What? You're not the only one
who can flirt.

39:58.477 --> 40:00.855
The door was open.

40:01.939 --> 40:04.442
- Thank you.
- Anything else I can do?

40:05.568 --> 40:08.237
- Could you take Rory home?
- Yeah, sure.

40:08.446 --> 40:10.031
What about you?

40:10.072 --> 40:12.909
I'm gonna stick around here for a while...

40:12.950 --> 40:14.952
and make sure everything's settled.

40:15.036 --> 40:18.289
- You take her, and I'll drive the jeep back.
- Okay.

40:19.415 --> 40:21.667
- He's gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

40:21.918 --> 40:25.880
I think it was those financial papers
that really did the trick.

40:25.963 --> 40:29.550
Luke's gonna take you home.
I'm gonna hang out here for a while.

40:29.592 --> 40:31.844
- I'll stay, too.
- No, go. Call Dean.

40:31.927 --> 40:35.681
Talk mushy and then spend an hour
arguing over who's gonna hang up first.

40:35.765 --> 40:38.017
- You're gross.
- I'll call you later.

40:38.100 --> 40:41.896
Okay. Tell him goodbye for me,
and tell him I'll come back tomorrow.

40:41.937 --> 40:43.773
- Okay, I will.
- Bye.

40:46.942 --> 40:49.403
Walk fast and look straight ahead.

41:00.289 --> 41:02.208
- Thanks.
- I'll call you.

41:05.169 --> 41:07.254
- He's almost asleep.
- Good.

41:09.799 --> 41:12.593
- Where's Rory?
- I sent her home with Luke.

41:12.802 --> 41:14.303
What about you?

41:14.804 --> 41:18.474
I thought I'd stick around
in case anybody needed anything.

41:19.141 --> 41:20.726
- Really?
- Not you.

41:20.810 --> 41:22.395
You obviously don't need anything.

41:22.478 --> 41:25.564
But somebody somewhere in this hospital
might need something...

41:25.648 --> 41:28.818
and I'm gonna be the person
who gets it for them.

41:29.652 --> 41:32.446
Would you like to go to the cafeteria
for something to eat?

41:32.488 --> 41:35.157
Yes, maybe somebody in the cafeteria
will need something.

41:35.241 --> 41:36.242
Oh, dear.

41:36.325 --> 41:38.536
And won't they feel lucky
when they see me?

41:38.619 --> 41:42.289
'I needed something, and there you were. '
It's gonna be a great moment.

41:54.677 --> 41:57.221
- Hello.
- Hey, how's your dad?

41:57.304 --> 41:58.556
Better...

41:58.973 --> 42:02.518
though he says life is not life
unless it includes a steak.

42:02.601 --> 42:05.813
- How come you're not out with everyone?
- I have some things to do.

42:05.855 --> 42:09.358
- Right. Anyway, this is for you.
- What's it for?

42:09.775 --> 42:12.653
Just thank you, Christmas, whatever.

42:12.695 --> 42:16.407
- Christmas isn't for two weeks.
- Do we really have to do this again?

42:18.868 --> 42:20.911
I just thought, God forbid...

42:20.995 --> 42:25.457
something happens to that one,
you might need a spare. Here.

42:33.966 --> 42:35.968
Does that look wrong.

42:38.387 --> 42:39.555
There.

42:41.056 --> 42:42.850
Turn out the lights.

42:42.892 --> 42:46.228
For what? It's not even
the real procession. It's just the rehearsal.

42:46.312 --> 42:48.564
So? It's pretty.

42:48.606 --> 42:51.567
Why do they need to rehearse it?
It's the same thing every year.

42:51.650 --> 42:53.527
Come on, Luke, please?

42:59.909 --> 43:02.953
It's hard to imagine
living somewhere else, isn't it?

43:03.120 --> 43:04.914
Thanks for the hat.

43:05.414 --> 43:06.957
You're welcome.

43:07.416 --> 43:09.084
Looks good on you.

43:09.835 --> 43:11.086
Good how?

43:11.837 --> 43:13.881
Just watch the procession.
