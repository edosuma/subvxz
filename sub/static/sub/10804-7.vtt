00:14.808 --> 00:17.561
Potential juror number 17,
please state your name.

00:17.644 --> 00:19.395
Richard Day.

00:20.438 --> 00:23.524
Can you state for the court
any preexisting opinion, any at all,

00:23.608 --> 00:25.860
that you may hold for the defendant,
Frank Castle?

00:25.944 --> 00:29.072
You mean the Punisher?
I think he's an animal...

00:29.155 --> 00:31.741
a sick, twisted, venal...

00:31.825 --> 00:34.327
Hero.
That's what we should be calling him.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.663
Doing the things the cops won't do,
Frank Castle is a...

00:36.746 --> 00:39.040
A grotesque insult
to the Second Amendment,

00:39.123 --> 00:42.168
a fascist without the authority.
If you ask me,

00:42.251 --> 00:43.837
people like Frank Castle ought to be...

00:43.920 --> 00:46.297
Applauded for putting all the thieves

00:46.380 --> 00:49.008
and muggers and rapists in the morgue,
where they belong.

00:49.092 --> 00:54.305
Let those bastards feel scared
walking down the street for a change.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.742
It's Son of Sam all over again.

01:13.825 --> 01:14.951
It's Bernie Goetz...

01:15.034 --> 01:16.911
It's like the only thing protecting us
is Frank.

01:16.995 --> 01:19.706
I just moved my family to New York,
and now we're moving out.

01:19.789 --> 01:23.793
If anyone can kill anyone in this town...
where does the insanity end?

01:40.769 --> 01:45.189
Counselors, over 400 potential jurors
have come through this courtroom.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.482
So I should tell you,

01:46.565 --> 01:50.695
if you can't agree to move forward
with the 12 men and women selected,

01:50.779 --> 01:53.865
I will make this trial
a living hell for all of you.

01:53.948 --> 01:57.201
Your Honor, New York hasn't seen a trial
this divisive and this public in years.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.746
Finding an impartial jury is not easy.

01:59.829 --> 02:02.040
Everybody has an opinion
about Frank Castle.

02:02.123 --> 02:06.753
It's New York, Mr. Nelson.
Everybody has an opinion about everything.

02:06.836 --> 02:10.924
Ms. Reyes, is the prosecution
satisfied with its jury panel?

02:11.007 --> 02:13.885
-Yes, Your Honor.
-And the defense, Mr. Nelson?

02:16.930 --> 02:20.599
- Uh, yes, Your Honor, we are.
- Thank Christ.

02:22.601 --> 02:25.689
The trial of The People
of New York v. Frank Castle

02:25.772 --> 02:27.565
is now in session.

04:03.077 --> 04:07.123
If I get my hands on the worthless intern
who organized these files...

04:07.206 --> 04:09.918
Oh, I'm sure that intern's
just following the DA's orders.

04:10.001 --> 04:11.460
It's not officially sabotage,

04:11.544 --> 04:14.380
- just sets it back.
- It's a cheap trick.

04:14.463 --> 04:18.301
We got bigger problems.
Like, locking a defense.

04:18.384 --> 04:21.137
-M'Naghten Rule's still our best bet.
-What's that?

04:21.220 --> 04:24.598
-Uh, the, uh, insanity plea.
-Whoa, whoa, guys...

04:24.682 --> 04:26.725
We need to buy a "not guilty" verdict.

04:26.810 --> 04:28.770
My high school debate team
could prove that Castle did it.

04:28.853 --> 04:30.188
We need an affirmative defense.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.982
Yeah, yeah, I get that,
but I'm not so sure Frank is insane.

04:33.732 --> 04:37.111
I'm no doctor, but I'd say he's at least
driven past Crazy Town.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.780
- Foggy, I'm serious.
- She has a point.

04:38.863 --> 04:42.366
I mean, insanity only has a 0.12%
acquittal rate in New York.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.577
Reyes is just gonna call in

04:44.660 --> 04:47.121
some expert shrink witness
to blow our case apart.

04:47.205 --> 04:49.623
- What case?
- Look, what if we...

04:49.707 --> 04:52.585
push for a mistrial?
We get more time.

04:52.668 --> 04:54.796
We talk about the DNR and the suits
and Reyes' involvement.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.965
We get her kicked off the case.

04:57.048 --> 04:58.716
She wouldn't see it coming.

04:58.800 --> 05:02.846
If we go down that road now,
we gotta prove, in a court of law,

05:02.929 --> 05:06.349
that the government willfully
hid evidence of the Punisher ambush,

05:06.432 --> 05:07.934
and that Reyes was involved.

05:08.017 --> 05:11.270
-Well, I was there and you were there.
-We're not exactly impartial, okay?

05:11.354 --> 05:13.857
And either way, we need
an opening statement tomorrow.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.400
I can open with PTSD
as a mitigating factor,

05:16.484 --> 05:17.776
focus on Castle's time at war.

05:17.861 --> 05:19.946
So you think the war
is what made Frank what he is?

05:20.029 --> 05:22.656
Our only goal is to reduce the charges
and set precedent.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.408
Castle made a lot of enemies, all right?

05:24.492 --> 05:26.452
If he goes into general population,
he's as good as dead.

05:26.535 --> 05:29.372
We need to get him somewhere safe,
where he can get help, and...

05:29.455 --> 05:30.456
citing PTSD could do that.

05:30.539 --> 05:33.584
I mean, none of us know
what Castle saw over there...

05:33.667 --> 05:39.048
but research suggests that...
PTSD can be triggered by new stressors.

05:39.132 --> 05:40.466
Like losing your family.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.010
I need to get to work
on the opening statement,

05:42.093 --> 05:44.137
but we need to be sure
Castle will get on board with this.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.804
Uh, I'll try.

05:45.889 --> 05:48.557
I mean, Frank made it pretty clear
he's willing to talk to me, at least,

05:48.641 --> 05:50.226
just as long as I'm alone.

05:50.309 --> 05:54.022
-Are you sure you wanna do that?
-Well, I wanna help.

05:54.105 --> 05:56.524
We have a better shot
at getting him to talk if I go.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.903
I'll grab the list of questions
I was working on.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.905
Okay.

06:04.782 --> 06:05.950
Karen...

06:07.368 --> 06:10.579
You know you don't
have to do this by yourself.

06:10.663 --> 06:13.166
It's okay.
Castle doesn't scare me.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.795
- Maybe he should.
- I can take care of myself.

06:18.796 --> 06:22.341
I know...
but I'd be saying it to Foggy.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.677
- Or a Navy SEAL.

06:27.596 --> 06:28.806
Just watch your back.

06:32.310 --> 06:33.519
Promise.

06:35.104 --> 06:37.606
Here you go.
Just do me a favor, stick to the script.

06:37.690 --> 06:38.691
Okay.

06:40.068 --> 06:43.029
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

06:45.656 --> 06:48.409
- Grow up so fast, don't they?

07:55.184 --> 07:58.312
- Hi, Frank.
- Ma'am.

08:06.820 --> 08:11.367
Um, we've been, uh,
looking over similar cases...

08:11.450 --> 08:12.701
legal precedents, and, uh...

08:12.785 --> 08:16.372
we... we think it would help
to bring forth someone from your past...

08:16.455 --> 08:19.917
maybe from your... your military unit,
someone who could, uh...

08:20.001 --> 08:21.710
speak to the nature of your service.

08:21.794 --> 08:26.132
-What's that got to do with anything?
-Um... it's a character witness.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.386
Uh, we put someone on the stand who...
who knows you well.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.430
Uh, can...
can speak to what you've been through.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.598
PTSD, huh?

08:35.766 --> 08:37.685
We think it would greatly
help with your defense.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.688
Don't do that.
It's an insult.

08:41.439 --> 08:43.232
Lots of veterans experience it.

08:43.316 --> 08:44.900
I'm not talking about me,
I'm talking about them.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.820
It's an insult to them,
people who are actually going through it.

08:47.903 --> 08:51.282
I know what you wanna do,
you wanna sit here and label me

08:51.365 --> 08:55.161
just another case of some crazy-ass
combat vet who lost his mind, huh?

08:55.244 --> 08:59.040
Maybe that'll appeal to some shitbag jury
in some shitbag court.

09:01.167 --> 09:03.294
It wasn't on a battlefield.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.340
That's not when my life went to shit.

09:09.050 --> 09:11.677
Now, ma'am, I believe that you told me
that you were gonna find me answers.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.721
That's what you said to me.
Do you have anything for me or not?

09:13.804 --> 09:14.972
-Not that easy.
-That what you want?

09:15.056 --> 09:17.100
-You want things to be easy?
-You are on trial

09:17.183 --> 09:20.186
for multiple homicides and you don't
have a defense strategy in place.

09:20.269 --> 09:23.064
You don't cooperate with us,

09:23.147 --> 09:25.566
it doesn't matter if I help you
figure out who killed your family,

09:25.649 --> 09:26.942
you will never see justice.

09:27.860 --> 09:32.740
All you will do, the rest of your life,
is rot in a goddamn jail cell!

09:41.790 --> 09:44.835
Colonel Ray Schoonover.
My old CO.

09:46.962 --> 09:50.133
Let's forget the PTSD defense,
but if you want a character witness,

09:50.216 --> 09:51.717
the colonel, he will do.

09:53.094 --> 09:54.095
Thank you.

09:54.178 --> 09:57.014
Now, ma'am, do you have
anything for me or not?

09:58.099 --> 10:02.603
Maybe I just ought to go back
and rot in my goddamn jail cell?

10:03.854 --> 10:06.774
Yeah.
Yeah, I did some digging.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.403
All right, there are huge moving parts
and they do not want to be seen.

10:10.486 --> 10:13.239
I've already looked at all of those.
I've done it a hundred times.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.032
Sure...

10:15.116 --> 10:16.534
but you haven't done it with me.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.462
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

10:28.546 --> 10:31.674
- Imagine, if you will--

10:33.551 --> 10:36.304
--Yeah, this is Matt.

10:36.387 --> 10:39.432
- I found a lead.
- Hold on.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.232
Elektra, I can't do this right now.

10:48.316 --> 10:50.568
The guy who encoded
that ledger of ours?

10:50.651 --> 10:52.695
Some pervy NYU professor,

10:52.778 --> 10:55.448
master cryptographer
who teaches Asian studies.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.866
- I'm gonna go beat the cipher out of him.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.243
-Yeah.
-You wanna come?

10:59.327 --> 11:00.536
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.288
You check out these Dogs of Hell depos?

11:02.371 --> 11:03.414
Might as well have been written in crayon.

11:03.497 --> 11:04.790
I think we could poke some holes in these.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.709
That's great. Yeah.
Just, uh, give me a minute.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.636
The most important case we've ever handled
starts in the morning.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.054
I can't go with you.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.848
-Can't or won't?
-Can't.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.351
My life doesn't stop every time you call.

11:23.434 --> 11:26.144
This may be our one chance
to translate this ledger

11:26.229 --> 11:30.233
before the Yakuza adjust their plans
and we lose all the progress we've made.

11:30.316 --> 11:31.484
You're infuriating.

11:31.567 --> 11:34.194
Tell me in person. Two hours.
Barclay and Church.

11:34.278 --> 11:37.323
I know I'm into some sick shit,
but next time, I swear,

11:37.406 --> 11:41.285
all I wanna do is eat moo goo gai pan
off your bodies.

11:41.369 --> 11:44.663
All day.

11:44.747 --> 11:48.542
-We're not Chinese.
-Whatever, it's all hot to me.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.295
What?

11:51.379 --> 11:53.589
He's a repulsive asshole.

11:53.672 --> 11:57.635
A repulsive asshole
who pays well.

11:58.802 --> 12:03.266
I can't tell any of you apart,
but I guarantee...

12:03.349 --> 12:07.270
I know all your tongues
better than you do.

12:07.353 --> 12:10.230
So... be nice.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.150
Get out.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.210
Hey, honey, I'm home.

12:32.295 --> 12:35.381
And you've been awfully naughty.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.554
You're gonna wanna stay real still.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.693
What the hell do you want from me?

12:55.776 --> 12:58.779
-You were hired by the Yakuza.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.864
You encrypted files for them.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.908
Money must be good.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.828
Not many professors can afford
garish, high-rise flats

13:05.911 --> 13:08.331
and a revolving door of prostitutes.

13:08.414 --> 13:09.707
What do you want me to do?

13:09.790 --> 13:13.711
What you do best, Philip.
Translate.

13:13.794 --> 13:14.837
But this time for us.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.131
They will kill me
if I tell you anything.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.258
And if you don't,
we'll make you beg for killing.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.894
Thirty stories up, Philip.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.980
You'd make a mighty good mess.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.399
More liquid than solid,
I'd imagine.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.736
-What do you say, Professor?
-Come on, please...

13:40.153 --> 13:41.238
Please... please.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.031
- I'll pay you, I'll do anything.
- Once more.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.453
I can't.
I can't, they'll kill me.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.580
- It's gonna break.

13:49.663 --> 13:50.998
Okay!
Okay, shit!

13:51.081 --> 13:52.916
- Stop! I'll do it! I'll do it!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.042
I'll help you.

14:03.135 --> 14:06.680
All right, be a pet and tell us
how to read this last page.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.018
They wanted a code
that couldn't be hacked.

14:15.564 --> 14:18.275
I put the Japanese alphabet...

14:18.359 --> 14:20.068
through a cipher.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.905
Now...

14:22.988 --> 14:26.909
put the characters through the matrix,
you can decode it all.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.452
You do it.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.923
There's weekly shipments.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.384
Next one is tonight at 11:00.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.595
Bay Ridge Rail Yard.

14:46.679 --> 14:49.014
You find a boxcar with that number...

14:50.307 --> 14:52.768
and you can find the train
you're looking for.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.019
What are they shipping?

14:54.937 --> 14:56.146
It doesn't say, I swear.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.691
- I swear!
- I can't help you anymore.

15:02.861 --> 15:06.073
Well, thank you
for your help, Professor.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.994
Do yourself a favor.
Find better business partners.

15:11.829 --> 15:13.080
And kill your decorator.

15:34.643 --> 15:37.187
Hey. Hungry?

15:37.270 --> 15:40.566
No. I don't think
I'm ever gonna eat again.

15:41.609 --> 15:43.444
Cost of looking at these all day.

15:43.527 --> 15:46.321
Yeah.
How about some fresh coffee?

15:46.404 --> 15:48.156
Yes.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.579
Uh, where's Matt?

15:53.662 --> 15:56.206
I thought he'd be
burning the midnight oil with you.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.917
I... He's, um...

15:59.001 --> 16:01.253
He's working on his opening statements.

16:01.837 --> 16:03.005
Oh.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.341
Did you... you talk to Castle?

16:07.926 --> 16:09.470
Yeah, um...

16:11.263 --> 16:14.850
He, uh, won't endorse PTSD, so...

16:14.933 --> 16:16.644
Oh, shit!

16:16.727 --> 16:19.104
He's... he's not having
war flashbacks, Foggy.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.481
It... it's just not the truth.

16:20.564 --> 16:23.441
Did Castle say anything that we can use?

16:23.526 --> 16:25.443
'Cause when the judge
calls his first witness tomorrow,

16:25.528 --> 16:28.947
my only plan so far is to run away, and...

16:29.031 --> 16:30.866
open a butcher shop.

16:30.949 --> 16:34.912
Well... I, uh, went over
some of our files with Frank.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.498
The medical examiner's report
from his family's murder,

16:37.581 --> 16:38.749
it's filled out by a, um...

16:39.667 --> 16:41.877
-Dr. Gregory Tepper.
-Yeah.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.796
He's the chief medical examiner.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.089
He's scheduled to testify for Reyes.

16:46.173 --> 16:51.428
Well... his report says
that Lisa, Frank, Jr. and Maria Castle

16:51.512 --> 16:55.641
each were killed by a single gunshot,
but Frank says there were multiple wounds.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.769
He describes them in awful detail, um...

16:59.770 --> 17:01.564
different angles, uh...

17:01.647 --> 17:04.441
bullet calibers, exit wounds
that are too big for a handgun.

17:04.525 --> 17:07.528
I mean, his family
was practically shredded.

17:07.611 --> 17:11.657
There's a discrepancy,
which is good, but...

17:11.740 --> 17:15.869
it's still their word against Frank's,
who was also shot in the head.

17:15.953 --> 17:16.954
Okay.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.873
Just for a minute...

17:20.916 --> 17:23.961
try... try to be Frank Castle.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.672
To be solely fueled by...

17:26.755 --> 17:30.050
by a single cluster of seconds.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.638
One moment in... in your entire life...

17:37.933 --> 17:41.103
And every time you close your eyes,
you relive that moment.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.148
And every time you open them,
you find only the...

17:45.232 --> 17:50.153
the briefest peace before you realize
that that nightmare is real.

17:51.614 --> 17:53.531
That nothing has changed.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.452
Your family isn't coming back.

17:58.621 --> 18:00.873
And so you watch them die...

18:01.874 --> 18:04.167
all over again right in front of you.

18:05.085 --> 18:08.380
We're not talking about something
that happened to Frank Castle,

18:08.463 --> 18:11.424
we're talking about something
that is happening to him.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.096
I hear you.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.766
But...

18:18.849 --> 18:22.060
short of having his family's
bodies exhumed...

18:23.604 --> 18:26.857
we still have no proof
that what Frank is saying is the truth.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.945
Okay, so...

18:33.571 --> 18:36.825
Let's say the ME's report... was doctored.

18:36.909 --> 18:40.245
It's still tangential and,
so far, inadmissible.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.708
What?

18:44.792 --> 18:48.629
Unless we can get this ME to corroborate
Frank's story on the stand.

18:49.672 --> 18:51.256
Can you do that?

18:51.339 --> 18:55.052
It's a long shot.
He's still probably in her pocket, but...

18:56.053 --> 18:57.054
if it works...

18:58.138 --> 18:59.640
maybe we expose Reyes

18:59.723 --> 19:01.684
and we get the mistrial
you've been praying for.

19:01.767 --> 19:05.729
So, trial starts in a few hours,

19:05.813 --> 19:07.648
and in lieu of a bullet-damaged brain,

19:07.731 --> 19:11.902
our case hinges on getting
a dirty medical examiner

19:11.985 --> 19:13.320
to crack on the stand.

19:14.822 --> 19:17.658
Guess I'll call Matt.
Give him the news.

19:17.741 --> 19:18.867
Oh, I'll do it.

19:18.951 --> 19:22.204
As long as he has
the opening statement of the year, I'd...

19:23.580 --> 19:25.582
I think maybe we have a chance.

19:30.921 --> 19:34.632
We should make bets
on what the Yakuza are exporting.

19:34.717 --> 19:37.302
Hundred bucks says exotic animals...

19:37.385 --> 19:39.888
or counterfeit purses.

19:39.972 --> 19:42.307
Last time these guys
brought something into town,

19:42.390 --> 19:45.227
it was a cargo ship transporting a kid.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.688
- Human trafficking?
- Yeah, something like that.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.780
- Oh...
- Elektra.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.242
All these cars are empty.
This one's full.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.953
So are the others beyond it.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.706
-Full of what?
-I don't know.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.624
There's no negative space.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.168
Cargo is uniform.
There's no real shape.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.545
There's a lot of it, though.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.464
Enough to buckle the tracks.

20:15.215 --> 20:18.176
You're right.
This is ours.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.345
Come on, let's go.
Let's have a look.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.575
- Dirt.
- Do they know we're here?

20:43.660 --> 20:44.745
Is this a decoy?

20:47.664 --> 20:48.791
Wait.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.086
- They're coming.
- Let's go.

22:30.225 --> 22:32.102
- You okay?

22:33.103 --> 22:35.605
The best things in life
leave you breathless, right?

22:36.273 --> 22:40.318
I'm glad you feel that way,
'cause I got something for ya.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.826
--It's your lucky day.

23:32.495 --> 23:33.496
Ahh!

24:03.693 --> 24:06.363
What the hell took you so long?

24:11.868 --> 24:13.370
- You hurt?

24:17.790 --> 24:19.376
- Let me see.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.004
Ow.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.218
Do you think
this one will scar?

24:28.301 --> 24:30.220
Don't they all?

24:31.888 --> 24:34.057
I suppose I'll never have
short hair again.

24:34.141 --> 24:37.227
Well, you could always tell people
you got it fighting the Yakuza.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.522
No one would believe you anyway.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.821
-All right.
-Thank you.

24:51.533 --> 24:54.869
- We make a good team, Matthew.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.331
Keep some pressure on it.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.380
What do you tell people?

25:06.506 --> 25:07.590
About?

25:09.134 --> 25:10.802
Where you got your scars?

25:14.764 --> 25:17.100
Um...

25:17.184 --> 25:19.186
Lucky me, I wear suits to work, so...

25:20.187 --> 25:21.396
rarely comes up.

25:22.605 --> 25:25.192
What do you tell the women
you bring home?

25:25.275 --> 25:27.319
Well, they're enjoying themselves
too much.

25:27.402 --> 25:29.404
--They don't ask.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.613
Sure.

25:34.409 --> 25:35.410
Oh, hey.

25:36.328 --> 25:39.164
- You're bleeding.
- Oh.

25:46.088 --> 25:49.382
-That okay?
-It takes a lot more to hurt me.

25:52.219 --> 25:54.971
You, on the other hand...

26:05.857 --> 26:09.068
Oh... I haven't seen this one.

26:10.862 --> 26:13.072
Yeah, the Russians like their knives.

26:14.116 --> 26:15.992
At least, I think it was the Russians.

26:17.494 --> 26:18.995
And these?

26:20.538 --> 26:21.789
The Yakuza.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.043
Actually, a ninja named Nobu.

26:27.212 --> 26:29.131
Nobu Yoshioka?

26:29.214 --> 26:30.840
What, you know him?

26:30.923 --> 26:32.800
By reputation.

26:35.011 --> 26:38.014
Yeah, this was him, too.
That hurt.

26:39.056 --> 26:41.893
And the, uh, two on my back.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.984
Wasn't there in college.

26:50.067 --> 26:52.279
Most of them weren't.

26:54.239 --> 26:55.490
You've been busy, huh?

26:56.199 --> 26:57.742
Seems we both have.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.713
Where did you go, Elektra?

27:13.675 --> 27:15.343
The last time we were together...

27:20.348 --> 27:22.767
As far from you as I could.

27:24.602 --> 27:28.981
And...
did you find whatever...

27:30.024 --> 27:32.109
you were looking for?

27:33.736 --> 27:36.906
Mostly I found that I was alone.

27:38.450 --> 27:40.702
Then why didn't you come back?

27:42.370 --> 27:44.997
Because you don't know
what I know.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.754
Because you deserve better.

28:09.564 --> 28:11.233
Lie down.
Get some rest.

29:30.853 --> 29:34.316
I'm, uh...
I'm really late.

29:34.399 --> 29:39.446
I... I will look into the exports,
see where they're coming from.

29:39.529 --> 29:41.448
Yeah.

29:43.157 --> 29:45.785
Have a good day in court, Matthew.

29:55.545 --> 29:56.796
Today, of all days...

29:57.839 --> 29:59.799
I mean, he said he'd be late,
but this is ridiculous.

29:59.882 --> 30:02.009
Foggy,
what is going on with him?

30:02.969 --> 30:06.097
All rise.
Court is now in session,

30:06.180 --> 30:09.266
the Honorable Judge
Cynthia Batzer presiding.

30:09.351 --> 30:16.232
Indictment number 1986-4447,
The People v. Frank Castle.

30:16.316 --> 30:17.775
Be seated.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.406
Looks like you're a man down.

30:23.490 --> 30:26.075
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

30:26.158 --> 30:28.995
the defendant has been indicted
for several serious crimes.

30:29.078 --> 30:31.789
But I'm instructing you,
as a point of law...

30:31.873 --> 30:33.833
You know those college stress dreams,

30:33.916 --> 30:35.960
when you show up to your class
in your underwear?

30:36.043 --> 30:37.754
-Yeah?
-That's me right now.

30:38.755 --> 30:41.883
God damn, Matt was supposed
to deliver opening, not me.

30:41.966 --> 30:44.802
Ms. Reyes, are the People ready
to begin opening statements?

30:44.886 --> 30:46.262
More than ready, Your Honor.

30:47.304 --> 30:48.515
Should we be worried?

30:48.598 --> 30:51.976
I mean, there's no way Matt
misses this, right?

30:52.059 --> 30:53.478
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

30:54.604 --> 30:59.025
Frank Castle brutally tortured
and murdered 30 people.

31:00.234 --> 31:02.278
Thirty that we know of.

31:03.655 --> 31:06.282
He took the law into his own hands.

31:06.366 --> 31:12.038
Acted as judge, jury, and...
most violent executioner.

31:12.121 --> 31:17.334
And you will hear that the defendant's
victims were criminals...

31:17.419 --> 31:20.337
but the victims
are not on trial here today,

31:20.422 --> 31:23.966
and justice does not belong
in the hands of a man like Frank Castle.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.260
This isn't the Wild West.

31:26.343 --> 31:30.557
Justice is served here...
in a court of law.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.850
And it is up to each of you

31:32.934 --> 31:36.604
to take back the city
from lawless vigilantes...

31:37.522 --> 31:38.731
like Frank Castle.

31:45.447 --> 31:47.449
This man is no hero.

31:49.451 --> 31:50.910
He's a serial killer.

31:52.369 --> 31:54.872
And he is guilty.

31:58.292 --> 31:59.419
Thank you.

32:02.088 --> 32:05.758
Mr. Nelson, are you
prepared to make your opening statement?

32:05.842 --> 32:08.302
-She's good.
-So are you.

32:09.303 --> 32:10.680
Mr. Nelson?

32:12.640 --> 32:16.811
Mr. Nelson, are you reserving the right
to make your statement at a later time?

32:25.111 --> 32:26.112
Screw it.

32:27.238 --> 32:29.073
Um...

32:29.156 --> 32:32.702
No, Your Honor, um...
the defense is ready to proceed.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.417
Uh, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

32:41.669 --> 32:44.756
the defendant, Frank Castle, is not...

32:47.174 --> 32:48.425
Sorry.

32:50.470 --> 32:52.639
--Um...

32:53.389 --> 32:56.684
Mr. Castle is as much a victim...

32:59.604 --> 33:01.188
No, he's not.

33:08.530 --> 33:11.198
Okay, so...

33:11.282 --> 33:14.661
you're 19...
standing in hot sand...

33:15.411 --> 33:17.079
sun burning down...

33:18.873 --> 33:19.999
noise...

33:20.833 --> 33:22.919
yelling, gunfire...

33:24.420 --> 33:26.463
The only thing
that you know for sure

33:26.548 --> 33:29.216
is that you're surrounded
by an enemy that wants you dead.

33:30.968 --> 33:33.638
But you do it.
You endure it.

33:33.721 --> 33:35.347
Why?

33:35.431 --> 33:38.601
Because you have orders.
And you have a duty.

33:39.977 --> 33:43.064
And also because
your life doesn't end here.

33:44.231 --> 33:47.026
You have people you love
waiting at home.

33:47.944 --> 33:52.073
Because... aside from being
a decorated marine...

33:52.156 --> 33:57.411
the man before you is a good husband
and an excellent father.

33:58.913 --> 34:02.834
Frank Castle returned from the hell of war

34:02.917 --> 34:05.461
wanting nothing more
than to pick up his life.

34:06.754 --> 34:11.300
But his wife...
young son and daughter

34:11.383 --> 34:13.845
were brutally murdered by criminals,

34:13.928 --> 34:17.640
and no one, not the police and...

34:17.724 --> 34:21.644
certainly not the District Attorney
stepped up to make it right.

34:21.728 --> 34:23.730
See, Frank Castle never came home.

34:23.813 --> 34:26.858
He just traded in one war zone
for another.

34:31.070 --> 34:34.448
This trial isn't about vigilantes.

34:34.531 --> 34:37.493
It's about the failure
of the justice system.

34:37.577 --> 34:40.788
And how one man, Frank Castle,
is being used as a pawn

34:40.872 --> 34:43.082
to cover up that system's mistakes.

34:43.165 --> 34:45.835
The prosecution wants blood.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.087
But as the judge just said...

34:48.170 --> 34:52.133
to get it, they have to prove their case
beyond a reasonable doubt.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.177
So all I'm asking of you today...

34:56.095 --> 34:57.680
keep an open mind.

35:00.099 --> 35:02.268
That's all, Your Honor.

35:05.938 --> 35:09.316
That was a pretty thick slice
of bullshit there, counselor.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.068
Prosecution,
call your first witness.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.153
Yes, Your Honor.

35:12.236 --> 35:14.155
-Sorry, guys.
-Where the hell have you been?

35:14.238 --> 35:16.157
Look, I made a mistake, Karen,
I feel terrible about it,

35:16.240 --> 35:17.700
but, Foggy, I caught some of
your opening statement.

35:17.784 --> 35:18.993
- You did great.
- He was amazing.

35:19.076 --> 35:21.328
Hey, hey, thanks for keeping
us afloat, buddy.

35:22.371 --> 35:24.540
Yeah, well...

35:24.624 --> 35:28.044
hopefully Reyes didn't notice
my buckets of flop sweat.

35:28.127 --> 35:30.713
And if the DA's office didn't suspect
we had nothing before,

35:30.797 --> 35:31.798
they gotta be sure now.

35:31.881 --> 35:33.049
Well, then we'll just have to change that.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.051
Yeah, who's on the prosecution's
witness list for tomorrow?

35:35.134 --> 35:37.594
Uh... I've got it, here.

35:41.432 --> 35:43.017
Tepper, wonderful.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.687
Reyes is calling
the chief medical examiner.

35:45.770 --> 35:47.271
From rocky start to Hail Mary.

35:47.354 --> 35:48.355
Why, what do we know about him?

35:48.439 --> 35:50.733
I showed Frank a copy
of his family's autopsy report.

35:50.817 --> 35:52.609
He claims they're faked,
and Tepper's name is all over them.

35:52.694 --> 35:53.695
Well, that's great. All right.

35:53.778 --> 35:55.612
-So we should get him on the record.
-That's what we said.

35:55.697 --> 35:57.699
Which you would've known
had you shown up to the office at all.

35:57.782 --> 36:00.034
-Let me take lead on it, buddy.
-Like you took the lead this morning?

36:00.117 --> 36:01.869
You've made your point, all right?
Let me try at least.

36:01.953 --> 36:02.954
Let me get a crack at this guy.

36:03.037 --> 36:05.581
Even if we get the false reports
entered into evidence,

36:05.665 --> 36:08.542
and it's a big "if,"
since they concern an unrelated crime,

36:08.625 --> 36:11.295
odds are slim that this clown's
gonna incriminate himself.

36:11.378 --> 36:14.173
Unless two brilliant attorneys
can figure out a way to trip him up.

36:14.256 --> 36:17.802
-Exactly.
-You want it? Knock yourself out.

36:17.885 --> 36:21.889
But Tepper ain't talking without a fight.
The DA's pulling his strings.

36:21.973 --> 36:24.809
And he's had plenty of time
to bulletproof his story.

36:24.892 --> 36:28.604
We only have 12 hours to tear it down.
I don't know how we do that by tomorrow.

36:28.688 --> 36:32.108
Because Karen's gonna catch me up,
and we're gonna figure out a way.

36:33.275 --> 36:35.778
Fine, but I'm going back to the office,

36:35.862 --> 36:38.280
'cause I have the rest of the trial
to prep for.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.537
-You let him down, Matt.
-I know. Hey, I know.

36:45.621 --> 36:47.289
- But I'm gonna make it up to him.

36:47.373 --> 36:48.499
And I'm gonna make it up to you.

36:49.458 --> 36:50.793
Come on.

36:50.877 --> 36:52.628
You get Tepper thinking
about the real report.

36:52.712 --> 36:54.171
-Mmm-hmm.
-The real truth.

36:54.255 --> 36:57.091
And then when he's disoriented,
I follow up with something like...

36:57.174 --> 36:59.010
"Who had you change the report?"

36:59.093 --> 37:00.594
And even if he says "no one,"
it proves--

37:00.677 --> 37:02.096
It proves that the report was changed.

37:02.179 --> 37:03.597
-And that's--
-That's brilliant.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.058
-See? You're a natural.
-Huh.

37:06.142 --> 37:08.019
Well, I keep good company.

37:08.853 --> 37:09.896
Ah, you know what?

37:09.979 --> 37:12.148
Why don't I help you go through
Tepper's bread-crumb questions?

37:12.231 --> 37:13.983
We could, you know, set 'em up,
knock 'em down?

37:14.066 --> 37:15.692
All right, but it'll be boring.

37:15.777 --> 37:17.403
--And tedious.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.322
-Could take all night.
-Hmm.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.742
Well, I don't mind.

37:22.825 --> 37:24.911
-What?
-You ever consider law school?

37:24.994 --> 37:27.789
Oh, I don't know.

37:27.872 --> 37:30.249
Well, Foggy and I know
a lot of good people at Columbia.

37:31.542 --> 37:34.086
I mean, if it's even something you want.

37:35.712 --> 37:39.175
Just thinking Nelson and Murdock
might be more fun as...

37:39.258 --> 37:41.093
Nelson, Murdock and Page.

37:42.553 --> 37:45.848
You're... you're sweet.
Uh...

37:47.058 --> 37:50.436
I don't know. I don't know if law school's
really the right fit for me.

37:50.519 --> 37:51.896
Um...

37:51.979 --> 37:55.399
I guess there's just something
about the rules and the loopholes.

37:55.482 --> 37:58.903
It just feels like the truth
gets lost a little too often.

37:58.986 --> 38:01.155
Well, not every case will be
The People v. Frank Castle.

38:01.238 --> 38:02.323
Right, right.

38:02.406 --> 38:05.617
But, you know,
it's not just this case. It's...

38:06.828 --> 38:09.746
Uh...

38:11.791 --> 38:13.042
What is it?

38:16.212 --> 38:17.338
You know, we...

38:20.257 --> 38:21.383
You ever...

38:22.426 --> 38:24.553
think back to the night we first met?

38:25.972 --> 38:28.349
Yeah, all the time.

38:31.435 --> 38:34.355
While I sat in that police station...

38:34.438 --> 38:35.606
alone.

38:37.441 --> 38:39.235
I was afraid of the whole world.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.239
Well, at least, until...

38:43.322 --> 38:45.241
you and Foggy came into my life and...

38:46.575 --> 38:50.204
You trusted me.
You gave me hope.

38:53.207 --> 38:56.836
And then we came back to your place.

38:56.919 --> 38:59.338
- I offered you Thai food.

39:00.339 --> 39:01.590
God...

39:02.674 --> 39:05.261
I remember everything about that night,
'cause it's...

39:06.262 --> 39:08.389
not every day your life is threatened...

39:09.598 --> 39:11.893
then saved by a man in black.

39:14.979 --> 39:16.772
Hey, you...

39:17.648 --> 39:19.942
You believe in what he does?

39:20.026 --> 39:23.279
-You know, the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.
-Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. Um...

39:27.574 --> 39:28.910
I, uh...

39:31.162 --> 39:34.373
- What?
- I... believe in the law.

39:36.083 --> 39:39.003
-If that's what you're asking.
-Right. No, but... but...

39:39.086 --> 39:40.922
But what about when the law fails?

39:41.005 --> 39:42.756
Like it did with me,
like it did with Frank.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.926
You know, what are we supposed to turn to?
What should we...

39:45.009 --> 39:47.511
What should we believe
will protect us then?

39:49.388 --> 39:53.935
- See, you're asking a Catholic lawyer.

39:54.018 --> 39:55.727
- I, uh... Yes.
- What do you...

39:55.811 --> 39:58.480
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know.

39:59.899 --> 40:01.442
Uh, I guess it's just...

40:01.525 --> 40:04.278
ever since we took on Frank's case,
like...

40:04.361 --> 40:05.362
I keep...

40:06.363 --> 40:09.909
I keep asking myself if there's really
a difference between...

40:11.243 --> 40:13.704
between someone who saves lives and...

40:13.787 --> 40:17.208
someone who prevents
lives from needing to be saved at all.

40:17.291 --> 40:18.334
Right?

40:20.377 --> 40:21.462
Wait...
Wait a second.

40:21.545 --> 40:25.132
Frank Castle should be behind bars.

40:25.216 --> 40:27.676
I mean, he deserves a fair trial,
but he's murdered people.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.220
Yeah, right.
Bad people.

40:29.303 --> 40:30.721
I mean, like the ones
who killed his family

40:30.804 --> 40:31.805
or the ones who came after me.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.183
But it's not Frank's decision
who lives or dies.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.352
That's up to God...

40:36.435 --> 40:39.146
or sometimes a jury.

40:39.230 --> 40:41.065
What happened to Frank's family
is a tragedy, Karen,

40:41.148 --> 40:42.566
but it doesn't give him
the right to kill--

40:42.649 --> 40:44.651
No. No, no, no. God...
God, no! Not the right, that's...

40:44.735 --> 40:46.403
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm just saying that...

40:46.487 --> 40:48.030
I can understand why Frank...
why...

40:48.114 --> 40:49.823
why anyone would seek vengeance
for something after...

40:49.906 --> 40:51.408
-after losing it--
-Whoa, no, no, no.

40:51.492 --> 40:53.619
That's not the same.
Vengeance is not justice.

40:53.702 --> 40:55.287
What he's doing is completely wrong.

40:55.371 --> 40:57.206
But, right or wrong,
you can't deny that it works.

41:01.002 --> 41:02.211
You really believe that?

41:02.294 --> 41:03.963
I don't know. No.

41:09.593 --> 41:10.927
Maybe.

41:19.603 --> 41:21.272
-Um...
-No, um...

41:21.355 --> 41:23.857
You know, maybe this is a good time
to call it a night.

41:25.026 --> 41:27.444
I just think we're both exhausted,
and...

41:27.528 --> 41:30.031
-You know, a case this big, let's just...
-Um...

41:30.114 --> 41:31.490
Yes, you're probably right.

41:33.867 --> 41:36.996
I don't know, maybe, uh, after...
after the trial's over.

41:37.079 --> 41:39.415
- Yeah, a real date next time.
- Good.

41:42.543 --> 41:43.544
Thanks.

41:54.971 --> 41:56.973
-Uh, good night.
-Good night, Karen.

41:59.226 --> 42:00.644
Get some rest.

42:13.240 --> 42:17.328
-How long were you listening?
-I wasn't listening.

42:17.411 --> 42:19.038
I didn't hear anything
about your work

42:19.121 --> 42:22.499
that would make me want
to tie a noose and test it on my neck.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.086
I won't even mention what I didn't hear
about your girlfriend.

42:25.169 --> 42:28.339
-I warned you not to interrupt my life.
-This is not your life, Matthew.

42:28.422 --> 42:30.632
You may not give a damn about
what I've made for myself,

42:30.716 --> 42:32.509
but that is what's most important to me.

42:32.593 --> 42:35.804
All right?
She... is important to me.

42:36.722 --> 42:37.764
Right.

42:38.890 --> 42:39.975
Sorry.

42:41.602 --> 42:45.231
I didn't know your time pairing wine
with Thai food was so important.

42:45.314 --> 42:47.108
--What do you want?

42:47.191 --> 42:50.986
I looked more carefully at Roxxon's
construction investment.

42:51.070 --> 42:53.697
Seems there's only a small number
of projects in New York

42:53.780 --> 42:55.949
capable of moving that much dirt.

42:56.032 --> 42:59.245
We pay the sites a visit,
I bet we find out what they're hiding.

43:00.162 --> 43:02.539
-What are these sites?
-Um...

43:02.623 --> 43:06.210
The Conservatory Hotel,
the Midtown Tunnel project,

43:06.293 --> 43:08.712
and some big build site at 44th and 11th.

43:08.795 --> 43:10.797
44th and 11th.

43:10.881 --> 43:12.424
-You know it?
-Yeah, Midland Circle.

43:13.092 --> 43:14.551
There was a tenement on that block

43:14.635 --> 43:18.139
before Wilson Fisk swallowed it up
in his Better Tomorrow initiative.

43:18.222 --> 43:20.807
-How did the Japanese get hold of it?
-I don't know.

43:20.891 --> 43:24.270
But before I fought Nobu,
I found blueprints at Midland Circle.

43:25.479 --> 43:29.065
Now, I always thought Nobu was just
a weapon Fisk sent to take me out,

43:29.150 --> 43:31.402
that Fisk had interests
tied up in the building,

43:31.485 --> 43:32.903
but maybe he didn't want it at all.

43:32.986 --> 43:36.115
I mean, what if he only acquired
Midland Circle for the Japanese?

43:36.198 --> 43:38.033
That's a curious riddle,

43:38.117 --> 43:39.868
one I think we should go
and solve together.

43:39.951 --> 43:41.162
Elektra, I got court in the morning.

43:41.245 --> 43:43.872
-I got a case to prepare, I got...
-Tomorrow night, then.

43:48.043 --> 43:49.670
Cheap wine.

43:49.753 --> 43:52.256
Finish your homework.
I'll do some recon.

43:55.801 --> 43:58.220
And so, Dr. Tepper,
the medical examiner's office

43:58.304 --> 44:01.765
can confirm that the 15 victims
found at the Irish Social Club

44:01.848 --> 44:03.434
all died of multiple gunshot wounds.

44:03.517 --> 44:05.561
Yes, that's correct.

44:05.644 --> 44:11.066
Um, all 15 victims died of wounds
inflicted by the same caliber bullet...

44:11.150 --> 44:13.569
each shot multiple times.

44:14.361 --> 44:15.362
Thank you.

44:16.363 --> 44:17.406
Your witness.

44:23.119 --> 44:25.914
- Cross your fingers.
- I'm crossing everything.

44:37.176 --> 44:38.885
Dr. Gregory Tepper,

44:38.969 --> 44:41.555
how long have you been medical examiner
for the city of New York?

44:41.638 --> 44:44.015
Uh, 14 years,
uh, give or take.

44:44.099 --> 44:46.977
And how many death certificates would you
estimate you've signed in that time?

44:47.060 --> 44:48.061
Huh?

44:49.187 --> 44:51.648
Um, I don't, uh...

44:51.732 --> 44:52.858
It's probably in the tens of thousands.

44:52.941 --> 44:55.068
Objection, Your Honor,
leading the witness...

44:55.151 --> 44:57.529
- I'm not sure where.
- Mr. Murdock--

44:57.613 --> 44:59.323
I have something I need to say.

45:00.073 --> 45:02.451
-Doctor?
-Your Honor, I'm sorry, but...

45:02.534 --> 45:04.286
I have to, on the record...

45:05.454 --> 45:07.539
I need to say something
about what I did.

45:09.916 --> 45:12.336
- Clear the gallery.
- Yes, Your Honor.

45:12.419 --> 45:16.214
All jury members,
please exit back to the deliberation room.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.342
Everyone in the gallery,

45:18.425 --> 45:21.595
please make your way
out of the courtroom at this time.

45:26.850 --> 45:28.018
What's all this about?

45:29.102 --> 45:30.437
I...

45:30.521 --> 45:34.608
I know what the defense was gonna
ask me about, and it's true.

45:34.691 --> 45:36.568
I altered the autopsy reports.

45:36.652 --> 45:38.445
Uh, you're referring
to the official findings

45:38.529 --> 45:40.071
on the murders of Frank Castle's family?

45:40.155 --> 45:42.073
Not just them.

45:42.157 --> 45:44.242
You don't understand.
I had to do it.

45:44.326 --> 45:48.372
-Those animals came to my office.
-Who came to your office?

45:48.955 --> 45:50.916
After the defendant's
family was murdered,

45:50.999 --> 45:52.918
two men I'd never seen before...

45:53.001 --> 45:56.087
they warned me,
if I didn't fix the case reports,

45:56.171 --> 45:58.590
they'd come after my family next.

45:58.674 --> 46:02.260
You falsified the autopsy
findings on the Castle family?

46:02.928 --> 46:04.805
Them and one more.

46:04.888 --> 46:06.723
- Who?
- I don't know.

46:06.807 --> 46:08.809
Some John Doe killed the same day.

46:08.892 --> 46:11.186
Male, adult, multiple gunshot wounds.

46:11.269 --> 46:14.523
Look, you can fire me, arrest me...
I don't care.

46:14.606 --> 46:18.109
I thought this was behind me,
but after last night...

46:18.193 --> 46:20.612
Doctor, did something happen last night
to impact your testimony?

46:20.696 --> 46:23.031
She was in my house.

46:23.114 --> 46:24.366
She tied me up.

46:25.492 --> 46:28.954
She said she didn't give a damn
who got to me before.

46:29.037 --> 46:31.665
If I didn't tell the defense
what really happened,

46:31.748 --> 46:33.334
she'd hunt me down and kill me.

46:33.417 --> 46:35.419
-Who told you this?
-I don't know.

46:36.378 --> 46:37.379
A woman.

46:37.463 --> 46:40.424
Her face was covered.
Had some foreign accent.

46:40.507 --> 46:43.385
Your Honor, I believe the defense
intends to distract the jury

46:43.469 --> 46:46.972
and make this case about some
impossible-to-prove conspiracy theories--

46:47.055 --> 46:48.056
Impossible to prove?

46:48.139 --> 46:50.351
Your ME just confirmed
that he doctored the autopsy records.

46:50.434 --> 46:52.185
He also said that he'd been threatened.

46:52.268 --> 46:55.271
If my office finds out that your firm
had anything to do with this--

46:55.356 --> 46:58.359
Our firm? For all we know,
it was you who sent those goons.

46:58.442 --> 46:59.568
I've heard enough.

46:59.651 --> 47:03.405
It's clear to me that whatever Dr. Tepper
may know about these autopsy reports

47:03.489 --> 47:04.906
has been tainted

47:04.990 --> 47:08.118
by threats made by person
or persons unknown.

47:08.201 --> 47:09.828
Then the defense asks for a mistrial.

47:09.911 --> 47:13.039
Not on your life, Mr. Nelson.
I'm still not convinced these documents,

47:13.123 --> 47:15.709
whatever they may be,
are even relevant to this trial.

47:15.792 --> 47:18.837
I'm striking the doctor's entire testimony

47:18.920 --> 47:21.757
and instructing the jurors to disregard
anything they may have heard.

47:21.840 --> 47:24.468
-Your Honor, I strongly urge you to--
-We're done here, counselor.

47:24.551 --> 47:27.638
Trial will reconvene tomorrow
with the prosecution's next witness.

47:29.556 --> 47:31.266
Once again,
Reyes finds a new way to screw us.

47:31.349 --> 47:33.644
You'd think it'd get easier,
but somehow it's more painful.

47:33.727 --> 47:36.438
Foggy. Foggy... it wasn't Reyes.

47:37.439 --> 47:39.900
-What?
-The woman who threatened Tepper.

47:41.610 --> 47:42.778
It was Elektra.

47:44.070 --> 47:46.072
From college.

47:46.156 --> 47:48.324
-Elektra?
-Yeah, she's back in town.

47:49.701 --> 47:51.286
-Your ex-girlfriend?
-Yes.

47:51.369 --> 47:54.122
No.
This is insane.

47:54.205 --> 47:57.459
She's a diplomat's daughter, a...
a debutante.

47:57.543 --> 47:59.961
Not anymore.
She's, uh...

48:01.379 --> 48:03.590
She's... she's different.
She's... she's dangerous.

48:03.674 --> 48:06.134
Yeah, no shit.
She nearly got you expelled.

48:06.217 --> 48:09.471
I mean, she screwed your semester
of torts, civil procedure...

48:09.555 --> 48:12.265
You almost missed the final
because she hurt you so bad.

48:12.348 --> 48:13.391
And now, what?

48:13.475 --> 48:15.894
-She's... breaking into an ME's house?
-Okay.

48:15.977 --> 48:17.771
So, the Yakuza
didn't go away, all right?

48:17.854 --> 48:18.897
They're still here in Hell's Kitchen.

48:18.980 --> 48:21.357
Elektra is trying to help me stop them,
infiltrating--

48:21.442 --> 48:22.818
What are you even talking about?

48:22.901 --> 48:24.653
She was going up against them by herself,
and she--

48:24.736 --> 48:27.155
-Your ex-girlfriend?
-Yeah, I'm trying to protect the city--

48:27.238 --> 48:31.284
I knew she was crazy,
I didn't know that she was homicidal.

48:31.367 --> 48:33.244
She's, um...

48:34.538 --> 48:35.997
my new client.

48:37.332 --> 48:39.876
Foggy, the, uh... rich one.

48:39.960 --> 48:41.211
The private one.

48:44.172 --> 48:46.049
-You lied again.
-I did, I lied,

48:46.132 --> 48:47.884
but, look, the Yakuza are funneling
money into something

48:47.968 --> 48:49.511
even bigger and darker than before,
all right?

48:49.595 --> 48:51.137
Elektra came to me,
I'm trying to help her--

48:51.221 --> 48:53.807
You wanted to take this trial!

48:53.890 --> 48:56.226
You missed
strategy sessions...

48:56.309 --> 48:59.771
witness prep, opening statements,
and you criminally decimate--

48:59.855 --> 49:00.856
No, I didn't. She...

49:00.939 --> 49:02.774
I never told her anything about
the trial, all right?

49:02.858 --> 49:05.611
The one witness that could've helped us
do what I wanted to do,

49:05.694 --> 49:06.695
which is take down Reyes!

49:06.778 --> 49:09.322
She must've overheard me talking to Karen,
and then she moved on her own.

49:09.405 --> 49:10.949
I would... I didn't sanction,
I would never--

49:11.032 --> 49:13.744
- I don't care! I don't care, Matt!
- I'm furious with her!

49:13.827 --> 49:16.037
Stop acting like these things
just happen to you!

49:16.121 --> 49:18.832
No one's making you go out all hours
of the night fighting bad guys

49:18.915 --> 49:22.919
and nobody makes you lie to your friends,
over and over again!

49:24.505 --> 49:26.840
Elektra is not the problem, Matt.

49:29.593 --> 49:30.677
You are.

49:33.514 --> 49:34.598
It's almost dark.

49:34.681 --> 49:36.892
-I'm sure there's someplace you gotta be--
-You're not walking away.

49:36.975 --> 49:38.685
-No, 'cause you know what?
-Don't walk away from me, Foggy.

49:38.769 --> 49:42.438
If the last few days are any indication,
you sure as hell haven't been here!

49:45.400 --> 49:48.612
Going forward, I will count on you
for nothing at all.

49:53.033 --> 49:55.160
Tell your girlfriend to stay away
from my trial.

49:55.243 --> 49:57.037
Yeah, she's not...
Elektra's not my girlfriend.

49:57.120 --> 49:59.414
Then you should be the one
to tell Karen about her.

50:03.251 --> 50:04.502
Hey.

50:04.586 --> 50:07.548
-Hey, I heard yelling.
-Yeah, you should talk to Matt about it.

50:07.631 --> 50:08.632
- Foggy!

50:11.342 --> 50:12.886
-Hey, what the hell happened in there?
-We're fine.

50:12.969 --> 50:15.055
No, no, no, you don't treat me
like I'm just your secretary.

50:15.138 --> 50:16.389
I've done more work
on this case than you have!

50:16.472 --> 50:19.309
-I can't get into this right now, Karen.
-No, enough of the dodgy bullshit.

50:19.392 --> 50:20.936
I deserve to know
what is going on with you two.

50:21.019 --> 50:22.020
With you.

50:23.021 --> 50:25.481
You asking as my co-worker?

50:25.566 --> 50:28.401
- Or my girlfriend?

50:29.319 --> 50:31.071
-Both.
-Yeah.

50:31.154 --> 50:32.530
I am sorry you're caught
in the middle of this,

50:32.614 --> 50:34.449
- but right now, I have to go.

50:34.532 --> 50:37.160
-Where?
-I'll see you tomorrow, Karen.

50:39.955 --> 50:42.040
Yeah, maybe.

50:58.014 --> 51:02.143
What the hell did you do?
I told you to stay out of my life.

51:02.227 --> 51:04.270
I never asked you to coerce a witness!

51:04.354 --> 51:06.522
-You had a problem, so I stepped in.
-No! It doesn't help.

51:06.607 --> 51:09.234
We can't even use his testimony
because of you. It was all thrown out.

51:09.317 --> 51:11.194
I was only following your rules.

51:12.237 --> 51:14.865
-What rules?
-You don't get what you want by day.

51:14.948 --> 51:17.868
You take it by force at night.

51:17.951 --> 51:19.995
This is who you are, Matthew.

51:21.329 --> 51:24.082
And don't fool yourself into thinking
it's anything else.

51:24.165 --> 51:26.209
--What I do...

51:26.292 --> 51:27.919
is none of your business.

51:28.795 --> 51:32.090
-Both halves of my life are mine.
-Fine.

51:33.508 --> 51:36.094
I'll stay out of your boring legal shit.

51:37.721 --> 51:39.890
Now, you wanna fight me?

51:39.973 --> 51:42.893
Or you wanna fight the guys
who are tearing your city apart?

52:52.628 --> 52:55.673
-You didn't wanna help?
-You didn't want me to.

52:58.176 --> 52:59.177
Ready?

53:09.855 --> 53:11.022
You hear something?

53:12.899 --> 53:15.568
- We're alone.

53:39.384 --> 53:42.637
It's empty.
There's nothing in here.

53:42.720 --> 53:46.349
- The Yakuza were guarding something.
- Yeah, but...

53:53.606 --> 53:54.607
Shh!

53:55.525 --> 53:57.778
- Elektra.
- What?

54:00.864 --> 54:02.407
You're not gonna believe this.

54:16.963 --> 54:18.048
Holy shit.

54:22.302 --> 54:25.096
Why are the Yakuza
digging a hole?

54:27.598 --> 54:29.059
Give me the flashlight.

54:40.528 --> 54:43.865
-Did it hit the bottom?
-No.

54:45.033 --> 54:47.202
Tell me when it does.
