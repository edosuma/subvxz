...the freedom to fall short
of perfection

15:40.091 --> 15:42.808
and still be judged by the same
standard as everyone else? That.

15:42.849 --> 15:44.183
- Thank you.
- No.

15:44.217 --> 15:45.818
Didn't you hear our chant?
It was really quite clear.

15:45.849 --> 15:47.266
- It's quite long.
- You know, look.

15:47.333 --> 15:48.867
- We want to be socially responsible.
- We do.

15:48.952 --> 15:50.369
We want to do the right thing.
[ Sighs ]

15:50.420 --> 15:52.337
- But it's hard to keep track...
- So hard.

15:52.405 --> 15:53.939
...of all the companies
that we like

15:53.990 --> 15:55.440
- and that we don't like.
- Don't like.

15:55.508 --> 15:58.477
[ Sighs ] We're -- we're just trying
to make it in this world,

get her to her soccer game.

16:00.747 --> 16:01.913
- Ooh.
- Not Youth Soccer Federation.

16:01.981 --> 16:02.931
'Cause if it's Youth Soccer
Federation --

16:03.016 --> 16:04.349
- I don't want to know.
- Oh, my god!

16:05.100 --> 16:06.551
You know what?
Sh-shame! Shame!

16:06.585 --> 16:07.936
Shame!
Shame on you.

16:08.428 --> 16:10.946
You are no better than
the people in that restaurant.

16:11.031 --> 16:12.631
Come on, Cam let's go.

16:12.699 --> 16:13.916
Come on.

16:14.000 --> 16:14.800
Think they bought it?

16:14.802 --> 16:15.818
Keep your head up.
Don't look back.

16:15.886 --> 16:18.187
Being right
is mostly confidence.

16:21.642 --> 16:23.877
[ Sighs ]

16:24.807 --> 16:26.759
Okay, look.
I'm sorry.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.377
We good?

16:30.697 --> 16:31.681
Apparently not.

16:32.885 --> 16:34.769
Look, complaining about
a line at an airport

16:34.853 --> 16:36.587
is easier than
admitting the truth

16:36.622 --> 16:38.889
about why I want you
to become a citizen.

16:40.492 --> 16:41.575
I guess it still bothers me

16:41.660 --> 16:43.127
that you have all these ties
to Javier.

16:43.211 --> 16:44.595
What ties?
What are you talking about?

16:44.680 --> 16:46.564
Gloria Delgado-Pritchett.

16:46.648 --> 16:50.134
You still have his last name.
You're both Colombians.

16:50.185 --> 16:51.635
When you and I come back
to the country,

16:51.687 --> 16:52.937
we have to wait
in separate lines

16:53.005 --> 16:54.405
like we're not even
in the same family.

16:54.456 --> 16:55.740
I don't know.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.975
I guess I just thought that
if you committed to America,

16:58.043 --> 17:01.462
in some weird way,
you'd be recommitting to me.

17:03.972 --> 17:05.539
That's the longest
you've ever been quiet,

17:05.607 --> 17:07.457
and it's terrifying.

17:07.541 --> 17:09.108
I know nobody asked
for my advice --

17:09.176 --> 17:10.560
Yet you're talking.

17:10.645 --> 17:11.528
I agree with Jay.

17:11.613 --> 17:12.529
Let's hear him out.

17:12.614 --> 17:13.814
Don't do this for him, mom.

17:13.881 --> 17:15.115
You're all over the place.

17:15.183 --> 17:18.018
But you also shouldn't worry
about what dad thinks.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.453
I think you should become
a citizen

17:19.503 --> 17:22.888
because even back when
we were alone in our apartment,

17:22.957 --> 17:24.523
this is what you always wanted.

17:26.461 --> 17:28.528
Remember sitting by the window,

17:28.596 --> 17:31.782
watching reruns of "Miami vice"
on the neighbor's TV,

17:31.866 --> 17:33.717
and all the bad guys were caught

17:33.801 --> 17:36.486
and all the policemen had
those -- those nice cars?

17:37.175 --> 17:38.375
We used to watch that

17:38.426 --> 17:40.861
and think what
an amazing country this was.

17:42.697 --> 17:44.548
Did a little research.

17:44.632 --> 17:48.185
If mom isn't a citizen when Jay
"moves on to a better place,"

17:48.252 --> 17:50.921
we could be looking at
a pretty hefty estate tax.

17:51.005 --> 17:53.056
I don't want to sound
insensitive,

17:53.107 --> 17:55.659
but I have acquired
a real taste for truffles.

17:56.850 --> 17:58.384
All right, kids, four laps.

17:58.466 --> 18:00.016
First one to finish wins.

18:00.101 --> 18:02.319
It's not rocket science,
unfortunately for you,

18:02.403 --> 18:03.920
because I think
you'd find that easier.

18:04.005 --> 18:05.205
[ Laughs ]

Come on, Alex!
You can do it!

18:07.975 --> 18:09.860
I ran six miles
the morning you were born!

18:09.944 --> 18:11.778
You came out of the womb
ready for this!

Sanjay! Your 115 cousins
are rooting for you!

Why are you ignoring me?

All right, on your mark.

18:18.229 --> 18:20.731
Look. I didn't mean
to weird you out yesterday.

18:20.765 --> 18:23.283
Stop it. I'm not falling
for these little mind games.

18:23.368 --> 18:24.585
- Get set.
- It's not a game.

18:24.669 --> 18:26.670

Stop running, Alex!
It's a trap!

What are you doing?

18:35.797 --> 18:37.547
I was telling the truth
yesterday.

18:37.598 --> 18:39.316
I don't care
if I lose valedictorian

that I really like you.

Yes.

with my skinny legs.

I love your hair.

18:58.790 --> 18:59.708

gets an answer wrong.

I think we can dial it back.

So, co-valedictorians it is.
