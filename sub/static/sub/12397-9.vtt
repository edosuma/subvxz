09:09.410 --> 09:11.048
- EXCUSE YOU.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.446
- UH, I GOT
A CABLE INSTALLATION.

09:13.480 --> 09:16.517
MY CLIENT WAS GIVEN A WINDOW
FROM 7:00 TO 4:00.

09:16.550 --> 09:18.381
IT'S 5:15.

09:18.420 --> 09:21.116
RIDE WITH ME, AND I'LL
FILL YOU IN ON EVERYTHING.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.357

09:26.900 --> 09:28.197
- OH, WOW.

09:28.230 --> 09:29.424
SHE LOOKS A LOT YOUNGER
THAN YOU, ZACH.

09:29.460 --> 09:30.825
- OH, I WASN'T A STUDENT.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.394
I WAS WORKING CAMPUS SECURITY.

09:32.430 --> 09:35.297
GRETCHEN--
SHE DOESN'T JUDGE.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.308
- MM, BECAUSE TRUE LOVE
KNOWS NO BOUNDS.

09:37.340 --> 09:38.830
- TIMES ARE TOUGH, YOU KNOW.

09:38.870 --> 09:39.837
I'M WORKING TWO JOBS.
WE NEVER SEE EACH OTHER.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.472
- WHAT'S YOUR OTHER JOB?

09:41.510 --> 09:43.808

09:45.850 --> 09:47.477
- LIFE'S A BUFFET.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.771
- IF SHE HASN'T CHEATED ON YOU
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

09:48.820 --> 09:50.219
WHY WOULD SHE START NOW?

09:50.250 --> 09:52.241
- JUST--
I FEEL HER PULLING AWAY.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.110
I DON'T WANNA LOSE HER.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.116
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.479
I WON'T.

HEY, MAN, WE'RE GONNA STAY
IN HERE.

10:09.170 --> 10:11.229

10:28.090 --> 10:29.648
I DIDN'T GET TO PEE
IN THE OFFICE

10:29.690 --> 10:31.681
BECAUSE YOU SPAZZED OUT.

10:31.730 --> 10:32.822

DIDN'T HE?

13:08.820 --> 13:10.788
- HE SAID HE HAD TO PEE.

13:10.820 --> 13:14.381
- YES, BUT DO YOU BELIEVE
THE WORLD IS A MAN'S TOILET?

13:14.420 --> 13:17.184
- NO.
NO, I DO NOT.

MUCH CLEARER NOW.

13:22.460 --> 13:23.597
MY PREVIOUS DIAGNOSIS

13:23.630 --> 13:25.666
MAY HAVE BEEN PREMATURE,

YOU'RE AFRAID
THAT WORKING WITH SHAWN

13:36.040 --> 13:37.405
IS GONNA GET YOU KILLED.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.543
- WHAT?

13:39.580 --> 13:41.616
- IT'S ALL
IN MY LATEST BOOK.

13:41.650 --> 13:45.984
IN DREAMS I WALK WITH YOU.

I'M SURE THAT
YOU'LL FIND THIS ENLIGHTENING.

"WHEN ONE IS IN
A PERPETUAL STATE OF PANIC--"

13:56.500 --> 13:57.626
- PERPETUAL?
- THAT MEANS "NEVER-ENDING."

13:57.670 --> 13:58.796
- I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.468
I WAS EXPRESSING INDIGNATION.

IN HER COURT

14:43.810 --> 14:44.947
AND HAS BEEN FOR A WHILE.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.538
YOU SENT HER
FIVE DOZEN ROSES

14:46.580 --> 14:48.116
AND A CAKE
WITH NELSON ROCKEFELLER ON IT.

14:48.150 --> 14:49.708
- SHAWN, DR. SIMPSON SAYS

14:49.750 --> 14:51.809
THAT SHE IS THE KEY
TO MY MENTAL HEALTH.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.010

DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS ANYMORE.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.210
WHAT IS HE A DOCTOR OF,
EXACTLY, ANYWAY?

14:55.260 --> 14:56.784

LITTLE TRICKS

16:58.350 --> 17:00.215

JUST BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T LEARN
BASIC READING SKILLS

17:01.250 --> 17:02.547
WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG.

17:02.580 --> 17:06.983

18:27.340 --> 18:28.534
- YOU PLAYED COLLEGE BALL?
- OOH.

18:28.570 --> 18:29.935
- YEAH.

18:29.970 --> 18:31.335
THE MAJORS SCOUTED ME.
I HAD MY PICK.

18:31.370 --> 18:32.632
- OH.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.831
- AND THEN ATV HAD TO GO
AND FLIP.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.075
RUPTURED MY SPLEEN,
CRUSHED MY L-4 AND 5.

18:37.110 --> 18:39.772
DOC SAID IF I WASN'T SO DRUNK,
I'D'VE PROBABLY BEEN PARALYZED.

18:39.810 --> 18:41.846
- WOW.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.279
- NO COMPLAINTS THOUGH.
[laughs]

18:43.320 --> 18:44.617
FOR A DUDE
WHO'S NOT SPLITTING ATOMS,

18:44.650 --> 18:45.844
I THINK I DID OKAY.

18:45.890 --> 18:47.016
- WELL...
- GOT THIS SWEET GIG.

18:47.050 --> 18:48.688
GOOD HOURS, SUMMERS OFF.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.722
57 MINUTES TO SIN CITY,
GATE TO GATE.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.182
I AM BAKING MY CAKE
AND THEN FROSTING IT

18:52.230 --> 18:53.424
AND THEN EATING IT.

18:53.460 --> 18:56.623
WHALE TIME.
[chuckles]

18:56.660 --> 18:57.661
- HURT YOUR HAND?

18:57.700 --> 19:00.191
- OLD LACROSSE INJURY.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.697
WHAT DO YOU WANT, BUDUSKI?

19:02.740 --> 19:04.105
- THEY SENT ME
FROM THE OFFICE, COACH BAGG.

19:04.140 --> 19:05.937
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO READ THIS
AND APPROVE IT.

19:05.970 --> 19:10.976
ALSO, I THINK ONE OF THOSE
DODGEBALLS GLANCED MY SCROTUM.

19:11.010 --> 19:12.307
- STOP WHINING!
YOUR SACK'S FINE.

19:12.350 --> 19:14.170
I'LL READ IT LATER.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.312
- I DON'T KNOW, COACH.

19:15.350 --> 19:16.669
- WHAT'D I JUST SAY, WEANUS?

19:16.720 --> 19:20.850
GET OUT OF HERE,
AND GIVE ME 50!

19:20.890 --> 19:22.084
SEE, LOOK AT THAT EGGHEAD.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.680
HE HAS NO CHANCE
TO MAKE THE PROS.

19:24.730 --> 19:25.685
GOT NO STROKE
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

19:25.730 --> 19:26.958
NOT LIKE I DID.

19:26.990 --> 19:30.619
RAIN DANCE!

19:33.570 --> 19:35.561
- IT'S SO SAD.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.909
- CASH DOLARES.

19:37.940 --> 19:41.205
- 30, 31...

19:41.240 --> 19:42.229
[door shuts]

19:42.280 --> 19:44.202
- CABLE GUY WAS RIGHT.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.343
HIS WIFE'S GETTING COZY
WITH MR. WOODCOCK IN THERE.

19:46.380 --> 19:48.974
SHE LEAVES HIM
LITTLE BOOTY-CALL MEMOS.

19:49.020 --> 19:50.544
- [yawns]
POOR MR. CABLE GUY.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.614
- UH-HUH.

19:51.650 --> 19:54.517
- 34.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.016
- YOU LITERALLY JUST FELL ASLEEP
ON YOUR FEET.

19:56.060 --> 19:58.051
- SHAWN, I NEED TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

19:58.090 --> 19:59.182
- OKAY.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.596
- [sighs]
OH, MAN.

20:03.630 --> 20:04.927
[tense music]

20:04.970 --> 20:07.495
- 37.

20:07.540 --> 20:13.638

20:13.680 --> 20:14.977
- OH.

20:15.010 --> 20:16.500
- SHAWN?
- YEAH.

20:16.540 --> 20:19.600
THAT WAY.

20:26.150 --> 20:28.152
HUH.

20:28.190 --> 20:30.158
MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE GONE LEFT
AT THE WATER HEATERS.

20:30.190 --> 20:32.556
[door closes]

20:32.590 --> 20:36.526
GUS, WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.

20:36.560 --> 20:41.736
AS LONG AS WE STICK TOGETHER.

20:41.770 --> 20:45.308
[laughter]

20:45.340 --> 20:48.673
- WHAT WAS THAT?

21:01.920 --> 21:04.081
- GUS?
- YES?

21:04.130 --> 21:07.998
- WE NEED TO RUN.
- YES.

21:08.030 --> 21:09.327
- GUS?

21:09.360 --> 21:10.918
GUS, PICK UP YOUR FEET, MAN!

21:10.970 --> 21:13.495

21:13.540 --> 21:14.893
SHAWN?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.909
I CAN'T SEE YOU, SHAWN!

21:17.940 --> 21:20.033
- LEFT, GUS! LEFT!

21:20.070 --> 21:21.901
STAY WITH ME, GUS!

21:21.940 --> 21:24.044
I CAN SEE THE LIGHT!

21:24.080 --> 21:26.469
LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT!

21:26.510 --> 21:30.014
- DO NOT LEAVE ME, SHAWN!

21:31.890 --> 21:34.313
- LEFT! LEFT!

21:34.360 --> 21:36.248
LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT!

21:36.290 --> 21:38.224
- I CAN'T SEE YOU, SHAWN.

21:38.260 --> 21:40.922
DID YOU SAY LEFT OR RIGHT?

21:40.960 --> 21:42.393
- [deep voice] OH.

21:42.430 --> 21:44.193
AND PUT THE LOTION
IN THE BASKET, WILL YA?

21:44.230 --> 21:45.663
[chuckles]

21:45.700 --> 21:49.192
- WHEW.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.662
SHAWN, I'M COMING!

21:50.710 --> 21:51.768
[grunting]

21:51.810 --> 21:56.099
[laughter]

21:56.140 --> 21:57.869
WHO'S THERE?

21:57.910 --> 21:59.377
CAN YOU HELP ME
GET OUT OF HERE?

21:59.410 --> 22:01.048
I'LL BUY YOU SOME BUNUELOS.

[jump rope hits ground]
- WHAT?

22:41.860 --> 22:42.986
[both growling]

22:43.020 --> 22:44.920
- NO.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.855
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.026
[both laughing]

22:49.060 --> 22:51.722
- NO! NO!
[all laughing]

- SHAWN! DAMN YOU!

23:24.830 --> 23:27.594

23:31.270 --> 23:32.339
- DON'T! STOP, STOP.

23:32.370 --> 23:33.473
STOP, STOP WITH THE BALL.

23:33.510 --> 23:35.330
NO BALLS. PLEASE.

23:35.380 --> 23:36.369
NO BALLS IN MY FACE.

23:36.410 --> 23:38.105
- SHOULDN'T WE WAKE HIM?

23:38.150 --> 23:39.299
HE'S CLEARLY BEING PELTED
BY BALLS.

23:39.350 --> 23:41.318
- LET THE DREAM
RUN ITS COURSE, SHAWN.

23:41.350 --> 23:43.011
THIS IS
HOW THE THERAPY WORKS.

23:43.050 --> 23:44.312
IT'S NOT ALWAYS PLEASANT.

23:44.350 --> 23:46.944
- NO, STOP, OOH.
- [chuckles]

23:46.990 --> 23:48.480

[grunting]

23:57.530 --> 23:59.395
- [clears throat]

23:59.430 --> 24:01.637
- YOU LEFT ME, SHAWN.
YOU FLAT-OUT DESERTED ME.

24:01.670 --> 24:03.831
- WHAT?
WHY WOULD I POSSIBLY DO THAT?

24:03.870 --> 24:05.030
- YOU DID IT, SHAWN!
YOU ALWAYS DO IT!

24:05.070 --> 24:06.503
- GUS, WE GET CAUGHT TOGETHER,

24:06.540 --> 24:08.269
WE FACE DEATH TOGETHER,
IT HAPPENS EVERY WEEK.

24:08.310 --> 24:10.540
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE I STAND
WITH YOU ANYMORE, SHAWN.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.104
- WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD HIM

24:12.150 --> 24:14.471
HIS NIGHTMARES
WERE ALL ABOUT EMMANUELLE.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.579
- NO, I SAID
THEY WERE ALL ABOUT YOU.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.918
- WHAT?
THIS GUY IS A FRAUD, GUS.

24:18.950 --> 24:21.180
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
HE'S A REAL DOCTOR.

24:21.220 --> 24:23.552
- I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
I WAS RATED

24:23.590 --> 24:27.321
IN THE TOP 13 OF SANTA BARBARA
DREAM THERAPISTS IN 2007.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.659
I ONE TIME ACTUALLY ENTERED
KATE CAPSHAW'S DREAM

24:30.700 --> 24:32.361
AND INTERACTED WITH HER.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.537
[laughs]

24:33.570 --> 24:34.935
CAN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT IT

24:34.970 --> 24:35.698
BECAUSE OF
THE PENDING COURT CASE.

24:35.740 --> 24:39.005
BUT IMPRESSIVE, NO?

24:39.040 --> 24:41.907
- CAPSHAW.
YEAH. NAH.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.271
YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY COOL,
ACTUALLY.

24:43.310 --> 24:44.777
GUS, HEY.

24:44.810 --> 24:46.141
YOU KNOW THAT
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD YOUR BACK,

24:46.180 --> 24:47.579
AND I ALWAYS, ALWAYS WILL.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.576
- I DON'T KNOW, SHAWN.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.588
THINGS ARE CHANGING.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.316
I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL, BUT
I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T TRUST YOU.

24:54.360 --> 24:57.249
- OH, COME ON, BUDDY.
IT WAS JUST A DREAM, YOU KNOW?

24:57.290 --> 24:59.383
THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS
WHAT THEY SEEM IN DREAMS.

24:59.430 --> 25:01.898
- OH, YES, THEY ARE.
EVEN MORE SO.

25:01.930 --> 25:04.091
- [pops lips]

25:04.130 --> 25:05.529
NO.

25:05.570 --> 25:08.232
NO, GUS, THAT'S IT.
WE KNOW BETTER.

25:08.270 --> 25:11.103
THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS
WHAT THEY SEEM.

25:11.140 --> 25:13.836
- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I'LL TUTOR
FUNCTIONALLY ILLITERATE ADULTS.

25:15.540 --> 25:16.575
- FOR A DUDE
WHO'S NOT SPLITTING ATOMS,

25:16.610 --> 25:18.703
I THINK I DID OKAY.

25:20.410 --> 25:22.514
GRETCHEN EIKLEBERRY
WASN'T HAVING AN AFFAIR.

25:22.550 --> 25:25.917
SHE WAS TEACHING COACH BAGG
HOW TO READ.

25:25.950 --> 25:27.656
- THEN PERHAPS YOU'LL ENJOY
MY LATEST BOOK.

25:27.690 --> 25:30.409
IN DREAMS I WALK WITH YOU.

25:30.460 --> 25:33.486
LET'S PICK_A RANDOM PAGE.
[mu5Ical ringtone]

25:33.530 --> 25:36.499
- EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.

25:36.530 --> 25:40.193
HELLO.
[sighs]

25:40.230 --> 25:42.790
I SEE.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.603
GUS, THAT WAS BRANNIGAN.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.733
I HAVE BAD NEWS
AND BAD NEWS.

25:46.770 --> 25:48.237
- I'LL TAKE THE BAD NEWS.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.009
- COACH DEREK BAGG WAS FOUND

25:50.040 --> 25:52.008
BEATEN TO A BLOODY PULP
IN HIS OFFICE.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.574
HE'S DEAD, GUS.
HE'S DEAD.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.178
- OH, MY GOSH.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.189
D. BAGG IS DEAD?
WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?

25:58.220 --> 26:02.281
- ZACH EIKLEBERRY HAS BEEN
ARRESTED FOR HIS MURDER.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.459
- HE HAS A BAD HEART.
AND GOUT.

26:04.490 --> 26:05.787
AND I.B.S.
- SHE GETS IT, GRETCHEN.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.559
I DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.228
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LAUGH
WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER!

26:10.260 --> 26:11.397
HI.

26:11.430 --> 26:13.660
I'M ALLERGIC TO EVERYTHING.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.338
- I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GETTING PAID FOR THIS.

26:15.370 --> 26:16.667
- LASSIE, THIS IS
NOT ABOUT MONEY.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.406
THIS IS ABOUT HONOR.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.408
THIS IS ABOUT PROFESSIONAL
CRIME-FIGHTING COURTESY.

26:20.440 --> 26:21.532
- AND MONEY.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.401
- THIS WAS OUR CASE FIRST!

26:24.450 --> 26:25.974
- SO I'M JUST SITTING THERE,

26:26.010 --> 26:28.570
CROCHETING ROBYN'S GIANT HAT,

26:28.620 --> 26:30.144
AND I JUST HAPPEN TO OVERHEAR
YOUR CONVERSATION

26:30.180 --> 26:32.011
ABOUT YOUR DOMESTIC CASE.

26:32.050 --> 26:33.915
- THAT IS BUSH LEAGUE.
- BUSH.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.110
_ THEN AT THE CRIME SCENE,
WHAT DO I FIND

26:36.160 --> 26:37.718
BUT A THREATENING LETTER
TO THE COACH

26:37.760 --> 26:39.580
FROM ZACH EIKLEBERRY?

26:39.630 --> 26:42.190
AND I SAY TO MYSELF,
"SELF, THAT'S YOUR GUY."

26:42.230 --> 26:43.788
- WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?

26:43.830 --> 26:45.923
- THEN I FOLLOW HIM
TO SOME BOWLING ALLEY,

26:45.970 --> 26:49.360
AND THERE I FIND
EVEN MORE THREATENING LETTERS.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.106
REAL SICKO STUFF.

26:51.140 --> 26:52.562
THE RAVINGS
OF A MANIAC WOODSMAN.

26:52.610 --> 26:54.271
- OOH.
- SMALL WORLD, HUH?

26:54.310 --> 26:57.302
- WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING.

26:57.340 --> 26:58.341
SOMEBODY DIED.

26:58.380 --> 26:59.677
- BUSH!

26:59.710 --> 27:01.143
both: BUSH!

27:01.180 --> 27:02.215
- HEY, ZACH.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.319
- HI, GUYS.

27:03.350 --> 27:04.715
- MR. AND MR. SPENCER.

27:04.750 --> 27:06.308
- I LIKE THE LADIES.

27:06.350 --> 27:08.250
- I'M AFRAID
I ONLY HAVE BAD NEWS.

27:08.290 --> 27:09.484
THERE'S HARD EVIDENCE THAT
IMPLICATES YOU IN THIS MURDER,

27:09.520 --> 27:11.624
AND WE DISCOVERED
THAT YOUR WIFE HERE

27:11.660 --> 27:13.582
ISN'T HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH ANYONE.

27:13.630 --> 27:15.621
IN FACT, I'M SENSING

27:15.660 --> 27:18.390
SHE WAS TEACHING COACH BAGG
HOW TO READ.

27:18.430 --> 27:20.022
- I JUST WROTE THOSE LETTERS
TO BLOW OFF STEAM.

27:20.070 --> 27:23.494
I DIDN'T BEAT ANYONE TO DEATH.
LOOK AT ME.

27:23.540 --> 27:25.303
I COULDN'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST MUSCLES MCHANDSOMEFACE.

27:25.340 --> 27:26.466
- NO.

27:26.510 --> 27:29.570
- SORRY I DOUBTED YOU, BABY.

27:29.610 --> 27:32.249
I JUST--I CAN'T SEEM
TO GET OUT OF MY OWN WAY.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.713
- THAT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE YOU HAVE WEBBED FEET.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.014
ZACH, SURE,

27:36.050 --> 27:38.086
SOME MEN FIND A SECOND WIND
IN MIDDLE LIFE

27:38.120 --> 27:41.248
AND GET THEMSELVES IN ANY SORT
OF PHYSICAL SHAPE.

27:41.290 --> 27:42.985
BUT YOU DIDN'T,
AND THAT'S OKAY,

27:43.020 --> 27:46.080
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU,
CABLE GUY.

27:46.130 --> 27:48.621
- THAT'S BACKHANDED, NO?
- UH-UH.

27:48.660 --> 27:51.128
- NOT ON THE LIPS.

27:52.430 --> 27:53.829
HE WOULDN'T HURT A FLY!

27:53.870 --> 27:55.599
HE'S NOT MAN ENOUGH!

27:55.640 --> 27:59.337
NO!

27:59.370 --> 28:00.462
- I LOVE YOU, BABY!

28:00.510 --> 28:02.535
- OKAY.
- I LOVE YOU!

28:02.580 --> 28:04.969
- I HEARD YOU!
[cell phone chimes]

28:05.010 --> 28:07.843
- WOODY!
- CA-CAW!

28:11.420 --> 28:13.115
- I NEED YOUR HONESTY.

28:13.150 --> 28:17.052
IS IT TOO MUCH?

28:17.090 --> 28:18.455
THE CHROME?

28:18.490 --> 28:19.718
- AH.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.022
- MM.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

28:21.060 --> 28:22.550
NO, IT'S--
- WORKS FOR ME.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.397
- REALLY? IT'S NOT
ALL MIDLIFE-CRISIS-Y?

28:24.430 --> 28:26.819
- NO, NO.
- NO. IT'S SO SHINY.

28:26.870 --> 28:28.030
- CAN'T GO WRONG
WITH THE CUSTOM.

28:28.070 --> 28:29.435
- PICKED A WINNER.
- YEAH.

28:29.470 --> 28:34.305
- [grunts]
WHY, I LOVE YOU BOTH SO MUCH.

28:34.340 --> 28:37.377
NOW WHOEVER KILLED THIS GUY MADE
SURE HE WAS NEVER COMING BACK.

28:37.410 --> 28:41.039
HE'S GOT FRACTURES
TO HIS RIBS, KNEECAPS, JAW.

28:41.080 --> 28:43.548
CRACKED HEAD, BROKEN NOSE.

28:43.580 --> 28:46.378
AND BASED ON THESE LACERATIONS
TO HIS WRISTS AND CHEEKS,

28:46.420 --> 28:48.559
I'D SAY HE WAS PROBABLY BOUND
AND GAGGED

28:48.590 --> 28:50.717
BEFORE THEY WENT AT HIM
PINATA STYLE.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.819
- WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH HIS DIGITS?

28:52.860 --> 28:54.919
- OH, YEAH. INDEX FINGER
AND MIDDLE FINGER ARE BROKEN.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.791
BUT IT LOOKS
TO HAVE BEEN DONE EARLIER,

28:56.830 --> 28:57.967
MAYBE A DAY OR TWO BEFORE.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.797
- IT'S AN OLD LACROSSE INJURY.

28:59.830 --> 29:01.536
- REALLY?

29:01.570 --> 29:03.629
- SPEAKING OF BABY-SMOOTH,

29:03.670 --> 29:06.662
I NAIRED MY BUTTOCKS
LAST NIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

29:06.710 --> 29:08.507
- MAN, I AM TIRED.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.531
- I'M TIRED TOO.

29:10.580 --> 29:12.548
AS MUCH AS I TRY NOT TO TAKE
MY WORK HOME WITH ME,

29:12.580 --> 29:14.719
WHEN I'M ALONE IN BED...

29:14.750 --> 29:17.810
AND I TURN OUT THE LIGHT...

29:17.850 --> 29:19.249
I SEE THEM.

29:19.290 --> 29:20.416
THEY TALK TO ME.

29:20.450 --> 29:21.815
THEY TELL ME
HOW THEY WISHED

29:21.860 --> 29:23.555
THEY HAD MADE
A DIFFERENT CHOICE IN LIFE.

29:23.590 --> 29:25.854
HOW THEY WISH THEY HAD TAKEN
A DIFFERENT PATH TO WORK

29:25.890 --> 29:27.653
THAT FINAL DAY OR--

29:27.690 --> 29:30.864
OR MADE ABSOLUTELY SURE
THEY LOCKED THE FRONT DOOR.

29:30.900 --> 29:34.631
WE ALL COME INTO THIS WORLD
THE SAME WAY WE GO OUT.

29:34.670 --> 29:37.195
ALONE.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.765
BUT SOMEHOW...

29:39.810 --> 29:42.278
THEY SEEM MORE LONELY
THAN THAT.

29:42.310 --> 29:44.540
- THAT'S INTENSE.
- THAT'S TOO LONELY.

29:44.580 --> 29:47.674
- I MEAN, TAKE THIS FELLOW.
I'LL BET HE WAS A GREAT GUY.

29:47.710 --> 29:49.849

I'M SORRY.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.829
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
TROUBLE SLEEPING, DEAR.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.246
- WHERE'S SHAWN?

31:24.280 --> 31:25.542
- HE WENT TO DRIVE
HIS DAD HOME.

31:25.580 --> 31:27.468

31:29.620 --> 31:33.386
THESE GRAW BOATS AREN'T GONNA

31:37.820 --> 31:40.152
BURTON, OH, GOD.
MY HANDS ARE WET.

31:40.190 --> 31:41.726
I'LL RUIN YOUR NICE SHIRT.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.796
- I DON'T CARE.

31:43.830 --> 31:47.823
OH, IT IS SO GOOD
TO BE HOME, MOM.

31:47.870 --> 31:49.269
IT FEELS SAFE.

31:49.300 --> 31:50.892
FINALLY.

31:50.940 --> 31:53.807
- THAT'S A NICE THING TO SAY.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.831
SO ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME
ABOUT EMMANUELLE?

31:55.880 --> 31:58.599
I THOUGHT SHE WAS SPENDING
THANKSGIVING WITH US.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.572
- OH, SHE BAILED ON ME, MOM.

32:00.610 --> 32:02.749
SHE'S NOT RETURNING MY CALLS
OR ANYTHING.

32:02.780 --> 32:06.284
- SHE DOESN'T DESERVE YOU.
WHO IS SHE, ANYWAY?

32:06.320 --> 32:07.878
WHAT HAS SHE DONE WITH HER LIFE?
- [scoffs]

32:07.920 --> 32:10.480
- YOU ARE BURTON GUSTER.

32:10.520 --> 32:12.556
IS SHE THE REASON YOU'RE HAVING
THESE BAD DREAMS?

32:12.590 --> 32:15.627

32:38.190 --> 32:39.942
- WELL, DARLING,
THE MORE THINGS CHANGE,

32:39.990 --> 32:41.912
THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.487
LIFE IS ABOUT BEING ADAPTABLE
BUT REMAINING TRUE TO YOURSELF.

I MEAN, WE CAN'T GOVERN
OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTIONS,

32:48.000 --> 32:49.695

OUR OWN.

OH, THANK GOD.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.192
I SAID WHEN I CAME BACK

THIS WAS OUR CASE.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.123
NOW CHECK IT.

37:50.160 --> 37:53.721
COACH BAGG WAS SUPPLEMENTING
HIS INCOME BY GAMBLING.

37:53.770 --> 37:56.034
- 57 MINUTES TO SIN CITY,
GATE TO GATE.

37:56.070 --> 37:58.368

37:58.410 --> 38:01.208
WHEN HE WAS DOING THOSE
SEXY CHIN-UPS ON THE FIELD.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.071
- GRETCH, CHECK THE LATS!

38:03.110 --> 38:05.305
I CAN DO, LIKE, 16 OF THESE!

38:05.350 --> 38:08.148
- BUT, BOY, WERE THEY BARKING
AT HIM IN OUR MEETING.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.876
- IT'S AN OLD LACROSSE INJURY.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.115
- THAT WAS
NO LACROSSE INJURY, GUS.

38:13.150 --> 38:15.914
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU DON'T PAY YOUR DEBTS.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.655
- [grunts]

38:17.690 --> 38:18.827
- I'LL GIVE YOU ONE GUESS.
TOO LATE.

38:18.860 --> 38:20.122
- GYM TEACHERS.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.958
- IT WAS
THAT BIG MEATHEAD PARENT.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.868
HE WAS NOBODY'S FATHER, GUS.

38:26.900 --> 38:27.992
WELL, HE MAY BE
SOMEBODY'S FATHER.

38:28.030 --> 38:29.065
I DON'T KNOW HIM FROM ADAM,

38:29.100 --> 38:30.533
BUT I DO KNOW THIS.

38:30.570 --> 38:32.401
HE WAS SOME BOOKIE'S MUSCLE,

38:32.440 --> 38:34.601
AND HE BROKE
COACH BAGG'S FINGERS.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.904
THEN, A COUPLE DAYS LATER,

38:36.940 --> 38:37.838
COACH COULDN'T COME UP
WITH THE DOUGH.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.177
BOOM!

38:39.210 --> 38:42.748
HE CAME BACK
AND FINISHED THE JOB.

38:42.780 --> 38:44.839
WHOO!
THAT'S HOW I DO IT!

38:44.890 --> 38:47.108
- [snoring]

38:47.150 --> 38:48.242
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

38:48.290 --> 38:49.814
WE'S ABOUT TO GET PAID.

38:49.860 --> 38:52.920
[engine revs]

38:52.960 --> 38:54.427
RELEASE THE PRISONER
AND RELEASE THE FUNDS!

38:54.460 --> 38:55.996
I'VE SOLVED THE CASE.

38:56.030 --> 38:57.998
- SHH.

38:58.030 --> 39:07.405
* WAIT FOR IT

39:07.440 --> 39:09.271
[rock music]

39:09.310 --> 39:10.379
- NO WAY.
- MAN.

39:10.410 --> 39:12.173
- NO DAMN WAY!

39:12.210 --> 39:13.575
HOW?

39:13.610 --> 39:17.114
- I'VE LEARNED NOT TO ASK.

39:17.150 --> 39:18.412
- YOU'RE FREE TO GO.
- OH, THANK YOU.

39:18.450 --> 39:20.247
- YOU'RE A FREE MAN.

39:20.290 --> 39:21.985
- I GOTTA THANK YOU GUYS.

39:22.020 --> 39:24.159
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS
THE SCARY DETECTIVE LADY

39:24.190 --> 39:25.350
WHO ACTUALLY GOT ME RELEASED.

39:25.390 --> 39:27.358
YOU GUYS TRIED,
WHICH IS SOMETHING.

39:27.390 --> 39:29.221
- WE'RE HAPPY
YOU FOUND EACH OTHER AGAIN.

39:29.260 --> 39:32.468
- GRETCHEN HELD VIGIL FOR ME
ALL NIGHT.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.365
I FELT LIKE
I WAS ON DEATH ROW.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.992
- IT'S TIME WE REESTABLISH

39:36.040 --> 39:36.995
WHAT MADE US A GREAT COUPLE
TO BEGIN WITH.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.564
WHATEVER THAT WAS.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.703
- SHE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A COMPLETE MAKEOVER

39:40.740 --> 39:42.401
INVOLVING EXTENSIVE WAXING.

39:42.440 --> 39:43.372
- HOPEFULLY, BY THE TIME
I'M FINISHED WITH YOU,

39:43.410 --> 39:44.946
I WON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE YOU.

39:44.980 --> 39:46.743
EXCEPT FOR
YOUR KIND, KIND HEART.

39:46.780 --> 39:49.169
- KIND HEART.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.370
- OH, GOD, SOMEONE
GIVE ME A GRAPPLING HOOK.

39:51.420 --> 39:53.183
- GRETCHEN.
- WHAT? YES.

39:53.220 --> 39:57.156
LET'S GO HOME.

39:57.190 --> 39:58.851
- YOU KNOW, SHAWN,

39:58.890 --> 40:00.118
I THINK THERE'S A LESSON
IN ALL THIS FOR ME.

40:00.160 --> 40:03.129
A ROAD MAP
BACK TO EMMANUELLE.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.422
- GUS, I'M ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN

40:04.470 --> 40:05.869
THAT THAT IS, IN FACT,
NOT THE LESSON.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.629
- MM.
- EMMANUELLE'S GONE.

40:07.670 --> 40:09.535
- MM-HMM.
- IN THE MEANTIME, YOU HAVE ME.

40:09.570 --> 40:11.629
AND YOUR COINS
AND YOUR STAMPS.

40:11.670 --> 40:14.036
- THANKS, EM MANUELLE.

40:14.070 --> 40:15.731
- YOU REALLY
DO NEED SLEEP, BUDDY.

40:18.450 --> 40:19.405
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

40:19.450 --> 40:20.474
I'M A CELEBRITY, ALL RIGHT?

40:20.510 --> 40:22.717
MY TWITTER ACCOUNT IS VERIFIED.

40:22.750 --> 40:26.379
AND I WAS PROMISED MASSIVE
RADIO AND SOCIAL MEDIA SUPPORT.

40:26.420 --> 40:28.285
UNG, LOOK AT ME
WHEN I'M BERATING YOU.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.548
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST FORGET IT.

40:29.590 --> 40:31.114
JUST--JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.229
I DON'T CARE
WHERE YOU GO, JUST GO.

40:32.260 --> 40:35.058
NOT THAT WAY,
GO THAT WAY!

40:49.510 --> 40:52.274
- I CAN IMAGINE.
WELL, I'M LOOKING FORWARD

40:52.310 --> 40:54.039
TO FINALLY READING
YOUR BOOK, DOCTOR.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.509
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.
[chuckles]

40:57.550 --> 40:58.812
TELL ME SOMETHING.

40:58.850 --> 41:00.738
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN SLEEPING?

41:00.790 --> 41:02.314
- LIKE A BABY,
THANKS TO YOU.

A DREAM CATCHER IN HUMAN FORM

41:05.890 --> 41:07.084
WITH A CHIN THAT'S COVETED
AROUND THE WORLD.

I'M JUST GLAD
THAT YOU WERE ABLE

41:09.530 --> 41:12.590
TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE
OF YOUR NIGHTMARES.

41:12.630 --> 41:14.996
- I NEED TO TAKE A LEAK.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.530
