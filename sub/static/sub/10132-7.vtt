Uh, the girls asked me if they

08:05.235 --> 08:08.029
could stay up a little late.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.198
We had no idea

08:08.071 --> 08:10.198
he'd say yes.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.951
Plus, it was an

08:10.240 --> 08:12.951
educational program.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.286
Tiffany?

08:14.328 --> 08:17.414
Tiffany, live from Tokyo.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.458
Danny, this is coming

08:17.456 --> 08:19.458
to us via satellite

08:19.499 --> 08:23.086
from one of Japan's oldest

08:19.499 --> 08:23.086
and most sacred malls.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.299
Oh, it's been

08:25.255 --> 08:27.299
a long day.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.843
Oh, yeah,

08:27.341 --> 08:29.843
I'm bushed.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.803
I can hardly keep

08:29.884 --> 08:31.803
my eyes open.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.888
- Oh, night, dad.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.888
- Goodnight, daddy.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.515
[yawns]

08:33.930 --> 08:35.515
Goodnight, dad.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.809
Hold it, son.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.021
Joey, face it.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.021
You're a soft touch.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.064
You let those girls

08:41.062 --> 08:43.064
take advantage of you.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.984
I know, Danny. I don't,

08:43.106 --> 08:45.984
I don't wanna be a bad guy.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.363
No, no.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.363
Freddy Krueger is a bad guy.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.781
Sometimes a parent

08:49.404 --> 08:51.781
has to say, "No."

08:51.823 --> 08:54.159
If you put your foot down,

08:51.823 --> 08:54.159
they'll respect you more.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.743
Are you sure?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.954
Trust me.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.954
I know my dad stuff.

08:57.996 --> 09:02.750
- Okay, no more Mr. Pushover.

08:57.996 --> 09:02.750
- Good.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.628
I can be as tough as any

09:02.792 --> 09:05.628
authority figure in this house.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.130
You can do it.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.966
Maybe I oughta tape the rest

09:07.172 --> 09:09.966
of that special..

09:12.344 --> 09:15.055
But they'll watch it when

09:12.344 --> 09:15.055
I tell them they can watch it.

[applauding]

09:42.916 --> 09:44.292
Well, Mr. Strowbridge,

09:42.916 --> 09:44.292
what do you think?

09:44.334 --> 09:45.626
I don't know

09:44.334 --> 09:45.626
much about music

09:45.668 --> 09:46.836
but I know what I like.

09:46.878 --> 09:50.257
- Did you like it?

09:46.878 --> 09:50.257
- I don't know.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.133
Well, here's a fun idea.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.427
After they sing there song

09:53.468 --> 09:55.220
have Danny do a number

09:53.468 --> 09:55.220
with the band.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.764
That's your fun idea?

09:57.805 --> 09:59.015
Rebecca, this is

09:57.805 --> 09:59.015
your show, too.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.892
- Why not you sing?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.892
- No.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.354
The audience loves to see

10:00.934 --> 10:04.354
you embarrass yourself.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.980
I love to see it, too.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.482
And I love it as well.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.401
But don't forget I'll be

10:07.524 --> 10:09.401
in Fresno tonight judging

10:09.443 --> 10:10.693
the Miss Kadota Fig Pageant.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.488
That's right.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.488
Fresno, fig judging.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.407
Yeah, I won't have any time

10:13.530 --> 10:15.407
to rehearse with the band.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.783
He won't have time to

10:15.449 --> 10:16.783
rehearse with the band.

10:16.824 --> 10:19.286
Trust me, sir, he does

10:16.824 --> 10:19.286
need a lot of rehearsal.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.247
He's not exactly

10:19.327 --> 10:22.247
a rock 'n' roll animal.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.957
I can get another band.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.501
On the other hand, he does

10:23.998 --> 10:26.501
have that Mick Jagger quality.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.258
Hello, Mrs. Gibbler.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.218
This is Joey Gladstone again.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.596
Uh, have you heard

10:35.260 --> 10:37.596
from D.J. yet?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.139
No?

10:39.180 --> 10:41.682
I'm worried sick and

10:39.180 --> 10:41.682
I don't know who else to call.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.017
Well, listen,

10:41.724 --> 10:43.017
if you hear from D.J.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.353
tell her I want her home

10:43.059 --> 10:45.353
immediately.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.105
Uh-huh. Thanks.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.900
Cookie.

10:50.942 --> 10:53.027
Michelle, no more cookies.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.737
Look at this, you can eat

10:54.779 --> 10:57.907
a magic, little green tree.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.534
Stephie, eat.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.078
Stephie?

10:59.576 --> 11:02.078
Eat broccoli?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.413
Get real.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.916
Steph.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.835
Has D.J. ever been late

11:06.958 --> 11:08.835
like this before?

11:08.876 --> 11:11.212
I don't think so,

11:08.876 --> 11:11.212
but everything before

11:11.254 --> 11:13.548
I was five

11:11.254 --> 11:13.548
is a little bit fuzzy.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.384
Hi.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.762
D.J., you're home.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.515
It's nice to see you, too.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.393
- You're an hour late.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.393
- Oh, sorry.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.061
After karate class,

11:25.435 --> 11:27.061
we all hung around

11:27.103 --> 11:28.146
and planned strategy

11:28.188 --> 11:29.981
for the big tournament

11:28.188 --> 11:29.981
on Saturday.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.317
It's gonna be so rad.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.819
What did you make for dinner?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.695
Can we order pizza?

11:36.737 --> 11:39.115
D.J., I was scared to death.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.534
I didn't know

11:39.157 --> 11:40.534
what happened to you.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.827
Joey, I'm fine.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.827
I was with my friends.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.622
- It's no big deal.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.622
- It's a very big deal.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.877
D.J., you know the rules.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.087
Why didn't you pick up

11:50.918 --> 11:53.087
a phone and call me?

11:53.129 --> 11:55.131
- I forgot.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.131
- That's no excuse.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.758
If your father was here, you

11:55.173 --> 11:57.758
would have remembered to call.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.344
Joey, why are you acting

11:57.800 --> 11:59.344
like this?

11:59.386 --> 12:00.970
Because you had me

11:59.386 --> 12:00.970
worried sick

12:01.012 --> 12:02.597
and you don't seem

12:01.012 --> 12:02.597
to care.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.891
- Joey, don't have a cow.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.891
- 'Don't have a cow?'

12:04.932 --> 12:07.602
That's it.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.602
This weekend, you are grounded.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.690
This weekend is

12:09.354 --> 12:11.690
my karate tournament.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.441
I've been practicing

12:11.730 --> 12:13.441
for months.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.527
Well, then I guess you're

12:13.483 --> 12:15.527
just gonna have to miss it.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.488
You gotta be kidding.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.488
I can't miss it.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.990
- Yes, you can.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.990
- No, I can't.

12:21.032 --> 12:23.034
When dad gets home,

12:21.032 --> 12:23.034
he'll say I'm ungrounded.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.494
I wouldn't count on that.

12:24.536 --> 12:27.121
I'm in charge here,

12:24.536 --> 12:27.121
and I say you're grounded.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.790
No, I'm not, I'm going

12:27.163 --> 12:29.790
to that karate tournament.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.918
- D.J.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.918
- You can't tell me what to do.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.294
You're not my father.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.558
Michelle, you want some egg?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.602
I made it look like

12:46.600 --> 12:48.602
the sun, see.

12:48.643 --> 12:51.020
There's little rays

12:48.643 --> 12:51.020
made of cheese.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.441
Cookie.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.152
Now, Michelle.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.447
I know I'm not your father

13:00.488 --> 13:01.989
but it would make me

13:00.488 --> 13:01.989
very happy

13:02.031 --> 13:03.991
if you ate some breakfast.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.784
Okay, Joey.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.456
Okay, here, Michelle.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.124
Oh, thank you.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.544
- Good morning.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.544
- Morning.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.794
Joseph, make sure

13:14.586 --> 13:15.794
to watch me on

13:15.836 --> 13:17.380
Danny's talk show

13:15.836 --> 13:17.380
this morning.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.591
You too, spanky.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.591
Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.429
Oh, egg sun

13:21.551 --> 13:24.429
with cheese rays.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.680
Very creative.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.435
Hey, Jess,

13:28.057 --> 13:30.435
have you seen D.J. today?

13:30.477 --> 13:33.229
Yes, I have and you're not

13:30.477 --> 13:33.229
her favorite guy this morning.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.481
Oh, man.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.856
Joseph, the kid was late.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.984
She didn't call.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.984
You had to do something.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.695
Just glad it was you

13:38.025 --> 13:40.695
and not me.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.821
I hate having D.J.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.821
mad at me like this.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.240
It's driving me nuts.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.992
I hate all this tension.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.034
I'm going upstairs right now

13:47.076 --> 13:48.202
and letting her off the hook.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.746
Woah, woah, woah, Joseph.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.998
Take it from a guy whose

13:49.788 --> 13:51.998
father grounded him a lot.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.541
Most of the '70s.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.586
We yelled and we screamed

13:53.583 --> 13:56.586
but it all blew over.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.005
You're doing the right thing.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.005
Stick to your guns, alright?

13:59.046 --> 14:00.423
Thanks.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.468
You done with

14:00.465 --> 14:03.468
that, Michelle?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.136
Ooh, I guess not.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.682
Glad to see your

14:06.721 --> 14:08.682
appetite is back.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.809
- Wish me luck.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.809
- 'Good luck.'

14:10.849 --> 14:12.226
- Bye! Pfft.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.226
- Bye!

14:16.147 --> 14:19.609
- Hi, Michelle.

14:16.147 --> 14:19.609
- Hi.

14:19.651 --> 14:23.863
- Good morning, D.J.

14:19.651 --> 14:23.863
- Good day, Mr. Gladstone.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.533
I, uh, made your lunch.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.868
No, thank you.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.868
I'll be purchasing my meal.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.745
[horn honking]

14:28.909 --> 14:30.745
There's my ride.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.163
Have a nice day.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.790
I intend to.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.042
Don't worry, Joey.

14:36.083 --> 14:39.546
I still love you, no matter

14:36.083 --> 14:39.546
how much you punish D.J.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.466
Can I eat her lunch?

14:50.014 --> 14:52.809
Over the years, the fig

14:50.014 --> 14:52.809
has gotten a bad rep.

14:52.851 --> 14:56.020
A lot of people think of it

14:52.851 --> 14:56.020
as only a filling for a Newton.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.648
That's fascinating.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.025
I can see why

14:58.690 --> 15:01.025
you're Miss Kadota Fig.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.654
You should.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.654
You were one of the judges.

15:04.696 --> 15:08.324
Yes. Well, what else

15:04.696 --> 15:08.324
do we have for today?

15:08.366 --> 15:10.493
Your brother in law's band.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.078
Oh, right.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.954
Honest folks, the fact

15:12.119 --> 15:13.954
that we're related

15:13.996 --> 15:16.249
has nothing to do with him

18:17.931 --> 18:20.808

(D.J.)

18:35.073 --> 18:36.699
'I'll start.'

18:36.741 --> 18:38.993
Dad, Joey had no right

18:36.741 --> 18:38.993
to try to ground me

18:39.035 --> 18:40.453
when I have a karate tournament.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.664
Dad, tell Joey

18:40.494 --> 18:43.664
he can't do that.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.459
D.J., you know that when

18:43.706 --> 18:46.459
I'm not here, I turn over

18:46.500 --> 18:50.129
all responsibility for you three

18:46.500 --> 18:50.129
girls to Uncle Jesse and Joey.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.381
Dad, that punishment

18:50.170 --> 18:52.381
is way too unfair.

18:52.423 --> 18:54.467
No stick.

18:54.508 --> 18:55.885
(all)

18:54.508 --> 18:55.885
Shh!

18:55.927 --> 18:59.388
That wasn't talking.

18:55.927 --> 18:59.388
That was explaining.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.975
D.J., I think the reason this

18:59.430 --> 19:01.975
is so hard for you is because

19:02.016 --> 19:04.393
it's the first time Joey's

19:02.016 --> 19:04.393
really put his foot down.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.315
I have to say that

19:06.479 --> 19:09.315
I side with Joseph 100 percent.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.859
You do the crime,

19:09.356 --> 19:11.859
you do the time.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.028

19:11.901 --> 19:14.028

19:14.070 --> 19:15.696

19:15.738 --> 19:17.698
I've been watching

19:15.738 --> 19:17.698
too many old movies.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.620
This meeting is not fair.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.620
Everyone's against me.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.831
Dad, do something.

19:24.872 --> 19:28.167
[sighs]

19:24.872 --> 19:28.167
Joey's decision is final.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.961
How can you do this to me?

19:30.003 --> 19:31.796
- D.J., you should have called.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.796
- I'm not doing anything to--

19:31.838 --> 19:33.172
That's exactly

19:31.838 --> 19:33.172
why you should have called.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.675
Joey was in charge--

19:35.716 --> 19:37.468
Stop it.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.054
I hate to see

19:37.510 --> 19:40.054
everyone fighting.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.265
Now just sit down and listen

19:40.096 --> 19:43.265
to what I have to say.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.101
Danny, you told me

19:43.307 --> 19:45.101
that if I put my foot down

19:45.143 --> 19:46.853
the girls would respect me.

19:46.894 --> 19:50.023
Now, D.J. hates me

19:46.894 --> 19:50.023
and my foot.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.650
D.J. was the one who came

19:50.064 --> 19:52.650
in late without calling.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.234
Why are you blaming yourself?

19:54.276 --> 19:55.987
Cause this whole thing started

19:54.276 --> 19:55.987
when I tried

19:56.029 --> 19:57.446
to be Mr. Discipline.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.615
That's not me.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.492
The best part about

19:59.657 --> 20:01.492
being in this family

20:01.534 --> 20:02.994
is all the love

20:01.534 --> 20:02.994
and all the great times

20:03.036 --> 20:05.538
we have together.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.915
My family was always fighting.

20:07.957 --> 20:11.085
I don't wanna go

20:07.957 --> 20:11.085
through that again.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.545
Oh, Joseph,

20:11.127 --> 20:12.545
there's no such thing

20:12.586 --> 20:14.588
as a family that doesn't fight.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.632
I mean, even Herman Munster

20:14.630 --> 20:16.632
yelled at poor little Eddie

20:16.674 --> 20:18.009
once in a while.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.846
Look, Joey.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.139
The love, the fun

20:23.181 --> 20:25.099
the responsibility,

20:23.181 --> 20:25.099
the discipline.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.684
They all go together.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.645
When you're in this family,

20:26.726 --> 20:29.645
you're in all the way.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.313
You did the right thing.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.067
D.J. deserved

20:31.355 --> 20:34.067
to be punished.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.401
Am I right, D.J.?

20:37.361 --> 20:39.697
Okay, I give up.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.366
I won't go to

20:39.739 --> 20:42.366
my karate tournament.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.368
But if you're waiting for me

20:42.408 --> 20:44.368
to be happy about it

20:44.410 --> 20:45.578
it won't happen.

20:48.206 --> 20:51.417
- I'll go talk to her.

20:48.206 --> 20:51.417
- No, I'll go talk to her.

20:53.544 --> 20:56.089
I have here

20:53.544 --> 20:56.089
the names of everyone

20:56.130 --> 20:57.924
who talked without the stick.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.218
Uncle Jesse, me,

20:57.965 --> 21:00.218
daddy, me again--

21:00.259 --> 21:01.552
- You little mouse.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.552
- Aah!

21:07.141 --> 21:08.267
[knock on door]

21:08.308 --> 21:10.561
D.J., can I talk to you

21:08.308 --> 21:10.561
a little more?

21:10.603 --> 21:13.898
Sure, I'm not going anywhere.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.898
Remember?

21:18.611 --> 21:20.529
I'm worried about

21:18.611 --> 21:20.529
what's happening to us.

21:20.571 --> 21:23.074
We've always been

21:20.571 --> 21:23.074
great buddies, right?

21:23.116 --> 21:24.283
Yeah, I guess.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.827
D.J., you know we have.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.579
I've known you

21:26.869 --> 21:28.579
your whole life.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.497
I was at the hospital

21:28.621 --> 21:30.497
the day you were born.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.210
Boy, when I first saw you

21:34.252 --> 21:36.045
talk about crying.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.547
You were fine.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.547
I was sobbing hysterically.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.802
But I did you a big favor

21:40.549 --> 21:42.802
that day, do you remember?

21:42.843 --> 21:44.929
Joey, I was a day old.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.305
Well, I remember.

21:46.346 --> 21:49.308
Your mom and dad

21:46.346 --> 21:49.308
wanted to name you Farrah.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.685
Farrah?

21:51.727 --> 21:54.354
I said, "Hey, we can't

21:51.727 --> 21:54.354
name her after a hairstyle."

21:56.649 --> 21:58.567
That was close.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.111
I better do my homework.

22:04.907 --> 22:08.119
D.J., we've always

22:04.907 --> 22:08.119
been great buddies.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.372
And I thought that

22:10.621 --> 22:12.372
living together would

22:12.414 --> 22:14.541
bring us even closer.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.711
'But now that I'm like a parent,

22:14.583 --> 22:17.711
it kind of changes things, huh?'

22:17.753 --> 22:21.548
Yeah, I never pictured

22:17.753 --> 22:21.548
you punishing me.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.675
Yeah, me neither.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.887
D.J.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.808
Last night when

22:28.597 --> 22:30.808
I didn't know where you were

22:30.850 --> 22:33.686
I was scared to death.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.479
If anything ever

22:33.727 --> 22:35.479
happened to you..

22:40.484 --> 22:44.822
I'm sorry about all those

22:40.484 --> 22:44.822
mean things I said to you.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.325
I was just mad.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.618
That's good.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.579
'Cause I love you so much.

22:52.621 --> 22:55.208
I love you, too, Joey.

23:01.547 --> 23:05.218
Hey, if it weren't for you,

23:01.547 --> 23:05.218
I'd be Farrah Jo Tanner.

23:06.593 --> 23:09.555
- Eww!

23:09.596 --> 23:12.474
You know what

23:09.596 --> 23:12.474
I'm thinking, Deej?

23:12.516 --> 23:14.935
I'm kind of new

23:12.516 --> 23:14.935
at this discipline thing.

23:14.977 --> 23:17.395
I know that you should

23:14.977 --> 23:17.395
be grounded, but..

23:17.437 --> 23:20.816
...maybe grounding you for this

23:17.437 --> 23:20.816
weekend was a little unfair.

23:20.858 --> 23:23.401
You mean it? I can go

23:20.858 --> 23:23.401
to my karate tournament?

23:23.443 --> 23:26.280
- Yeah, what the heck.

23:23.443 --> 23:26.280
- Thank you, thank you.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.075
You're gonna

23:27.489 --> 23:29.075
make a great dad.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.160
Why, cause you got

23:29.116 --> 23:31.160
what you wanted?

23:31.202 --> 23:33.411
No, because you were fair.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.915
Well, thanks.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.833
Now remember,

23:35.956 --> 23:37.833
next weekend, you're grounded.

23:37.875 --> 23:41.545
Oh, that's fine, that's great,

23:37.875 --> 23:41.545
that's perfect.

23:41.587 --> 23:42.963
Oh, wait, I just remembered.

23:43.005 --> 23:46.842
Kimmy and I had plans

23:43.005 --> 23:46.842
to go horseback riding.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.386
You know I had to try.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.764
Okay, just karate.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.557
- Ha!

23:51.805 --> 23:53.557
- Hyah!

23:56.852 --> 23:58.771
- Okay, I'm convinced.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.771
- Ha!
