WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:08.476
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.576 --> 00:10.244
A U.S. NAVY AIRCRAFT
HIT A TARGET

00:10.344 --> 00:11.745
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF BAGHDAD.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.347
TURNS OUT IT'S A MADRASA.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.216
IT'S AN ISLAMIC
RELIGIOUS SCHOOL,

00:15.316 --> 00:17.017
BOYS STUDYING THE KORAN--

00:17.118 --> 00:19.753
16 OF THEM DEAD.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.622
I FLEW THAT MISSION.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.091
MADRASA MURDERER.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.259
SHORTLY AFTER YOU
COMPLETE THIS MISSION,

00:25.359 --> 00:29.130
YOU WORK YOURSELF UP INTO
A STATE OF EXTREME EXERTION.

00:29.230 --> 00:32.166
DON'T YOU THINK THERE'S
A STRONG DESIRE THERE

00:32.266 --> 00:34.835
TO ATONE FOR YOUR ACTIONS?

00:34.935 --> 00:36.437
YOU'RE GOING
BACK TO A PLACE

00:36.537 --> 00:39.240
WHERE YOU DROPPED A BOMB.
YOUR FACE IS ON THE INTERNET

00:39.340 --> 00:41.242
AND THERE'S A PRICE
ON YOUR HEAD.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.485
SURPRISED?

00:52.586 --> 00:56.124
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D COME BACK AGAIN.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.527
- I'M BACK.
- GOOD.

00:59.627 --> 01:03.197
COME ON IN.

01:03.297 --> 01:07.168
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE?
I'VE JUST MADE A POT.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.802
YEAH, COFFEE'S GOOD.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.143
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?
I GOT, UH...

01:15.243 --> 01:17.145
SKIM, WHOLE MILK.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.380
- GOT SOME SOY HERE--
- BLACK.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.715
I LIKE TO TASTE
THE BEANS.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.118
- ( coffee pouring )
- BET YOU NEED A LOT OF COFFEE

01:24.218 --> 01:26.420
TO LISTEN TO
THE FUCK-UPS IN HERE.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.056
I DON'T DRINK COFFEE,
JUST TEA.

01:29.157 --> 01:33.294
I KEEP IT FOR MY PATIENTS.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.662
BLOOD PRESSURE?
IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.130
NO, I'VE JUST, UM--

01:36.230 --> 01:37.998
I'VE JUST NEVER REALLY
LIKED THE TASTE.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.401
AH, A SUBCONSCIOUS
IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.070
WHAT, DO YOU GET CHECKUPS?
EKG?

01:43.171 --> 01:44.938
YEP, EVERY YEAR.

01:45.038 --> 01:47.040
YEAH?
AND HOW'S YOUR HEART?

01:47.141 --> 01:48.676
IT'S PERFECT.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.945
UM, LOOK, ALEX, I'M--

01:52.045 --> 01:55.283
I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU CAME BACK.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.718
TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, I WAS, UM--

01:57.818 --> 02:00.288
I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED
AFTER YOU LEFT LAST WEEK.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.256
'CAUSE I WANTED TO GO
BACK TO BAGHDAD?

02:02.356 --> 02:04.592
- YES.
- WELL, I WENT.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.794
HMM.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.963
MAN, PAUL.

02:10.063 --> 02:11.799
( coughs )
SORRY, BUT...

02:11.899 --> 02:13.867
THE ONE THING I DON'T
COMPROMISE ON IS COFFEE.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.770
( theme music playing )

02:33.354 --> 02:36.257
IS THAT YOUR REACTION WHENEVER
THE COFFEE ISN'T PERFECT?

02:36.357 --> 02:38.592
ISN'T PERFECT?

02:38.692 --> 02:40.894
PAUL, IT'S LIKE ATTEMPTED
MURDER, YOUR COFFEE.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.896
- ( Paul laughs )
- BUT LET ME HEAR
YOUR INTERPRETATION.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.667
- IT'S OBVIOUS YOU HAVE ONE.
- WELL, NOT REALLY.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.602
I REMEMBER I USED TO HAVE
THIS PATIENT ONCE

02:48.702 --> 02:51.104
AND HE WOULD COME IN
AND BEFORE EACH SESSION

02:51.205 --> 02:53.374
HE WOULD SAY, "STOP."

02:53.474 --> 02:55.976
AND THEN HE WOULD
POP A PILL.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.911
AND IT WAS JUST A RITUAL--

02:58.011 --> 02:59.713
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

02:59.813 --> 03:02.883
WELL, I THINK,
IN HIS PARTICULAR CASE,

03:02.983 --> 03:04.418
WHAT HE WANTED
TO SHOW ME

03:04.518 --> 03:08.956
WAS HIS DISTRESS
AND HIS PAIN.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.525
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE WITH THE COFFEE,

03:11.625 --> 03:13.227
MAYBE YOU'RE
JUST TELLING ME

03:13.327 --> 03:15.095
THAT YOU'RE ONLY GONNA
COME TO THERAPY

03:15.195 --> 03:17.365
UNDER YOUR CONDITIONS.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.099
AND ANYTHING
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE

03:19.199 --> 03:20.634
YOU'RE GONNA
SPIT OUT RIGHT AWAY.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.803
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING
JUST A LITTLE DRAMATIC?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.838
- COME ON, PAUL.
- MAYBE.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.379
SO, ALEX...

03:33.213 --> 03:35.115
WHY DID YOU COME BACK?

03:35.215 --> 03:38.619
I WANT YOUR ADVICE
ON ANOTHER LITTLE MATTER.

03:38.719 --> 03:42.089
BESIDES, YOU DESERVE
TO KNOW HOW MY TRIP WENT,

03:42.189 --> 03:43.724
BEING THAT YOU HELPED ME
DECIDE TO GO.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.693
FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS,
BY THE WAY,

03:45.793 --> 03:48.296
BECAUSE MY VISIT DIDN'T
DO WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.431
AND WHAT WAS IT
SUPPOSED TO DO?

03:50.531 --> 03:52.633
LET'S JUST CUT
TO THE CHASE, OKAY?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.436
SATURDAY MORNING I'M
STANDING IN THE STREET
NEAR THE BOMB SITE.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.937
IT'S LIKE LONDON
AFTER THE BLITZ.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.439
JUST RUBBLE, YOU KNOW?

03:58.539 --> 04:01.475
THIS AREA HAD BEEN
HIT AGAIN AND AGAIN--

04:01.575 --> 04:04.645
BY US, BY THEM,
BY SUICIDE BOMBERS.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.548
WE HOOKED UP
WITH A RED CROSS UNIT.

04:07.648 --> 04:10.117
THEY TAKE US
TO THIS MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.386
IT'S A TRIAGE UNIT.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.888
THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH DOCTORS
TO TREAT EVERYBODY.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.123
IT WAS CHAOS.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.526
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

04:20.361 --> 04:22.630
I WAS JUST WATCHING.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.532
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND, DOC,
IN MY LINE OF WORK

04:24.632 --> 04:27.401
I'M 10-15,000
FEET UP IN THE AIR.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.003
MISSILE LOCKS IN
ON THE TARGET BY RADAR

04:30.103 --> 04:31.405
ON A SCREEN.
I DON'T SEE PEOPLE.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.842
I JUST PRESS
A BUTTON AND BOOM.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.716
IT WAS KINDA CRAZY TO BE
DOWN THERE ALL OF A SUDDEN.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.219
SO HOW DID THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL

04:46.320 --> 04:48.689
COMING FACE TO FACE
WITH THE VICTIMS?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.795
HOW WOULD IT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

04:58.031 --> 05:00.067
SCARED.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.870
UM, GUILTY.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.674
SEE, THAT WOULD BE
THE NORMAL REACTION.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.276
I KNEW THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
THE TRAUMA OF MY LIFE.

05:09.377 --> 05:12.813
BUT I FELT NOTHING.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.715
AND THEN I REALIZED

05:14.815 --> 05:17.751
THE SYSTEM DID
A GREAT JOB ON ME.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.555
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"THE SYSTEM"?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.357
LISTEN, THERE'S PEOPLE
DOWN THERE--

05:23.457 --> 05:25.526
ARMS AND LEGS MISSING,

05:25.626 --> 05:27.861
FACES BLOWN OFF--
IT'S CARNAGE.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.730
AND THE PARENTS
ARE WALKING AROUND,

05:29.830 --> 05:31.632
THEY'RE WAITING TO SEE IF
THEIR CHILDREN ARE GONNA LIVE

05:31.732 --> 05:33.634
OR DIE ALL BECAUSE
OF WHAT I DID.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.904
BUT WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?
TO ME THEY LOOKED LIKE

05:37.004 --> 05:39.507
200 PEOPLE STANDING
IN LINE AT THE PHARMACY.

05:39.607 --> 05:42.776
DID YOU FEEL ANY
CONNECTION WITH THEM?

05:42.876 --> 05:45.679
DID YOU FEEL
IN ANY WAY RESPONSIBLE

05:45.779 --> 05:47.681
- FOR WHAT THEY'D SUFFERED?
- NO NO NO.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.383
IN THAT MOMENT,
ALL I CARED ABOUT

05:49.483 --> 05:50.851
WAS WHETHER THEY
CHEATED ME OR NOT.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.787
I MEAN, THE SYSTEM.
THE PEOPLE IN THE MADRASA,

05:53.887 --> 05:56.323
IT WASN'T ANY DIFFERENT
THAN SEEING IT ON TV.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.892
THE ONLY THING
ON MY MIND IN THAT MOMENT

05:58.992 --> 06:01.028
WAS WHETHER THE SYSTEM
KNEW THAT THE BUILDINGS

06:01.128 --> 06:03.196
NEAR THE TARGET'S BUNKER,
THE ONE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO

06:03.296 --> 06:05.365
GET MY ONE-TON BOMB,
IF THEY KNEW

06:05.466 --> 06:08.135
THESE BUILDINGS WERE
FULL OF CHILDREN OR NOT

06:08.235 --> 06:10.804
AS THEY CLAIM.
NOTHING ELSE MATTERED.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.941
SO IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT...

06:15.042 --> 06:16.376
YOU HAD DONE
THE RIGHT THING.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.378
LIKE YOU SAID
LAST WEEK, IF YOU--

06:18.479 --> 06:19.847
IF YOU HIT THE TARGET
YOU SLEEP WELL.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.549
YES.

06:22.416 --> 06:25.753
AND ALL THOSE
PEOPLE WHOSE

06:25.853 --> 06:29.122
SUFFERING YOU WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR...

06:30.691 --> 06:32.860
COULD YOU NOT SEE THEM?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.228
NO NO. I SAW THEM.

06:35.328 --> 06:38.165
I FELT NOTHING FOR THEM.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.868
AND THEN I REALIZED,
HOW INGENIOUS

06:40.968 --> 06:42.302
THAT MY BODY

06:42.402 --> 06:44.438
HAS A BUILT-IN
SEPARATION MECHANISM.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.106
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
"SEPARATION"?

06:46.206 --> 06:47.541
COMPARTMENTALIZATION.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.843
I'M STANDING THERE
AND ALL I CARED ABOUT

06:49.943 --> 06:53.246
WAS WHETHER I MADE
A PRECISE HIT.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.115
THE ENEMY IS A FORMULA--

06:55.215 --> 06:57.751
SIZE OF BUILDING, AMOUNT
OF PEOPLE MULTIPLIED BY

06:57.851 --> 06:59.587
THE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES
DIVIDED BY 100

06:59.687 --> 07:01.388
EQUALS THE NUMBER
OF ESTIMATED CASUALTIES.

07:01.489 --> 07:05.192
YOU UNDERSTAND?
I'M STANDING THERE,
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.338
I HAD THIS FRIEND WHO DIED

07:18.438 --> 07:20.841
FOUR MONTHS AGO.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.576
ANYWAY, I--

07:22.676 --> 07:24.377
I WENT TO THE FUNERAL.

07:24.478 --> 07:27.748
AND ALL THROUGHOUT
THE SERVICE

07:27.848 --> 07:31.619
I KEPT SAYING TO MYSELF,
"WHY DON'T I FEEL SAD?"

07:31.719 --> 07:34.287
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
"MAYBE I DIDN'T LOVE HIM.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.825
MAYBE I DIDN'T CARE."

07:37.925 --> 07:41.629
I TORMENTED MYSELF
FOR ABOUT A WEEK.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.565
ANYWAY, FINALLY
I REALIZED

07:44.665 --> 07:47.568
THAT ACTUALLY
I FELT A GREAT DEAL.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.603
EVEN THE FACT
THAT I WAS SO BUSY

07:49.703 --> 07:51.471
WITH MY GUILTY FEELINGS,

07:51.572 --> 07:53.541
EVEN THAT ATTESTS

07:53.641 --> 07:56.677
TO HOW MUCH
I FELT ABOUT HIM.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.347
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
THAT I WAS FEELING

08:00.447 --> 08:02.115
BUT I DIDN'T FEEL
THAT I WAS FEELING?

08:02.215 --> 08:04.985
I THINK THAT YOU HAVE

08:05.085 --> 08:08.188
VERY VERY DEEP

08:08.288 --> 08:09.557
FEELINGS ABOUT THESE PEOPLE.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.159
BUT SOMETHING STRONG
INSIDE YOU

08:12.259 --> 08:15.462
PREVENTS YOU FROM
ACKNOWLEDGING THOSE FEELINGS.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.866
NOT JUST TO ME
OR TO ANYBODY ELSE,

08:19.499 --> 08:20.868
BUT TO YOURSELF.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.303
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

08:23.403 --> 08:24.872
I DON'T GET
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.940
FEELINGS ARE NOT
A PHILOSOPHY.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.476
YOU EITHER FEEL OR YOU DON'T.
YOU CAN'T BULLSHIT ABOUT IT.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.944
WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M BULLSHITTING?

08:31.044 --> 08:34.381
LISTEN, I'M PAYING YOU
$150 FOR LESS THAN AN HOUR

08:34.481 --> 08:35.816
AND I DON'T SEE YOU
MAKING AN EFFORT.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.417
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
SMARTER THAN ME

08:37.517 --> 08:39.086
AND I'M DEFINITELY
NOT FEELING THAT.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.221
OH, SO WE'RE COMPETING

08:41.321 --> 08:44.391
TO SEE WHO'S THE SMARTEST.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.826
YEAH?

08:45.926 --> 08:48.261
YOU KNOW, ALEX,
I THINK THAT

08:48.361 --> 08:49.997
HERE, LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE,

08:50.097 --> 08:51.665
LIKE WITH THE COFFEE,
FOR INSTANCE,

08:51.765 --> 08:55.769
YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH
WHAT'S THE BEST.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.440
MUST BE VERY DIFFICULT.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.810
COME ON, GIVE ME A BREAK.

09:02.910 --> 09:06.013
IT MUST BE KIND OF
FRIGHTENING FOR YOU TO FEEL...

09:08.716 --> 09:10.450
EMPATHY WITH THESE PEOPLE.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.587
SO YOU CREATE THIS
KIND OF ALTERNATE
REALITY FOR YOURSELF

09:13.687 --> 09:15.088
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHERE,

09:15.188 --> 09:17.758
"OH NO, THEY WERE JUST WAITING
IN LINE AT THE PHARMACY.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.961
I'M JUST THE
ACCIDENTAL TOURIST,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.063
NOT THE PILOT
WHO BOMBED THEM

09:23.163 --> 09:24.397
OR KILLED THEIR FAMILY."

09:24.497 --> 09:26.433
( laughs )

09:26.533 --> 09:29.970
OH, I WISH YOU WERE RIGHT.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.807
BUT IT'S MUCH MORE
FUNDAMENTAL.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.077
LOOK, IF YOU HOLD ON
TO THIS--

09:37.177 --> 09:39.246
THIS ORGAN

09:39.346 --> 09:41.715
CALLED GUILT FEELINGS--

09:41.815 --> 09:43.651
AND I BELIEVE
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.419
IT'S AN ORGAN
LIKE THE SPLEEN OR LIVER--

09:46.519 --> 09:50.090
THE SYSTEM WILL CUT IT
OUT OF YOU COMPLETELY.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.496
UNDERSTAND? I HAVE NO WAY
OF FEELING GUILT ANYMORE.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.565
I DON'T HAVE THE ORGAN.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.301
SO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
IT'S POSSIBLE TO

10:01.401 --> 10:05.172
AMPUTATE SUCH AN ORGAN?

10:07.875 --> 10:09.877
YOU WENT BACK TO IRAQ.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.514
WHY WAS IT SO IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO GO BACK?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.684
TO RISK YOUR LIFE
JUST TO--

10:16.784 --> 10:18.218
JUST TO BE THERE?

10:18.318 --> 10:21.388
I TOLD YOU, I WANTED TO CHECK
IF ANYTHING WAS LEFT.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.423
AND--

10:23.523 --> 10:25.693
AND I WANTED
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

10:25.793 --> 10:27.661
WHEN I COME DOWN
FROM THAT TOP VIEW.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.330
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.732
THAT'S RIGHT, NOTHING.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.203
CAN WE--

10:36.303 --> 10:38.271
CAN WE GO BACK
FOR A MOMENT TO THE, UH--

10:38.371 --> 10:40.473
TO THE SITE OF THE BOMBING?

10:40.573 --> 10:43.310
CAN YOU DESCRIBE ONE MOMENT
WHEN YOU SAID TO YOURSELF,

10:43.410 --> 10:46.313
"I SHOULD BE FEELING
SOMETHING NOW,

10:46.413 --> 10:48.982
RIGHT NOW, AND I DON'T"?

10:50.117 --> 10:52.753
( sighs )

10:54.021 --> 10:55.789
UM...

10:59.392 --> 11:00.794
YEAH, THERE WAS A MOMENT.

11:00.894 --> 11:04.264
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

11:04.364 --> 11:08.168
BUT THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN
THIS OLD MAN CAME OVER TO ME.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.469
HE HAD BEEN BURNED.

11:09.569 --> 11:12.740
HIS ARM WAS BANDAGED.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.143
HE KEPT LOOKING AT ME
WITH A STRANGE LITTLE SMILE.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.214
( speaks Arabic )

11:21.314 --> 11:24.484
WHICH MEANS "I KNOW YOU."

11:24.584 --> 11:27.220
"I KNOW YOU."

11:27.320 --> 11:29.322
I IGNORED HIM AT FIRST,
BUT A COUPLE MINUTES LATER

11:29.422 --> 11:30.623
HE WAS BACK.
"I KNOW YOU,"

11:30.724 --> 11:32.259
"I KNOW YOU,"
HE KEPT SAYING.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.028
FOR A SECOND I THOUGHT
HE DID RECOGNIZE ME,

11:35.128 --> 11:36.764
BUT I DIDN'T
REALLY BELIEVE THAT.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.032
I DOUBT HE'D EVER SEEN
THE INTERNET BUT...

11:41.034 --> 11:44.337
IN SOME DEEP
INTUITIVE WAY...

11:46.206 --> 11:48.041
HE KNEW.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.443
HE KNEW I WAS THE MAN
WHO DROPPED THE BOMB

11:50.543 --> 11:53.781
THAT DESTROYED THE WHOLE
STREET WE WERE STANDING ON.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.321
OH.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.423
YOU COULD BE--

12:03.523 --> 12:06.693
YOU COULD BE DESCRIBING
A MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE,

12:06.794 --> 12:08.628
LIKE A DREAM.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.363
YEAH, IT WAS LIKE A DREAM,

12:10.463 --> 12:12.099
LIKE A TOTALLY
BIZARRE DREAM.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.733
HE STARTED LOOKING
LIKE SOME OLD WARLOCK

12:13.834 --> 12:15.668
OUT OF, LIKE, A FAIRY TALE
OR SOMETHING.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.838
AND HE WOULDN'T
LEAVE ME ALONE.
HE KEPT POINTING AT ME.

12:17.938 --> 12:21.741
( speaks Arabic )
I KNOW YOU.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.812
AND I LOOKED IN HIS EYES.

12:24.912 --> 12:28.448
AND HE WAS SORT OF AMUSED,
KIND OF FRIENDLY,

12:28.548 --> 12:29.783
THE WAY MY FATHER
LOOKS AT ME

12:29.883 --> 12:31.318
WHEN HE THINKS
I'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.953
LIKE HE KNOWS MY SECRETS.
LIKE NO MATTER WHAT I DO

12:33.053 --> 12:34.421
I CAN'T HIDE FROM IT.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.356
AND I WAS FROZEN THERE.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.325
AND BY THAT TIME
PEOPLE HAD GATHERED

12:38.425 --> 12:39.893
AND THEY WERE WATCHING US.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.731
AND FINALLY SOMEONE
FROM THE CHURCH GROUP CAME
AND PULLED ME AWAY,

12:44.832 --> 12:47.835
BUT THAT OLD MAN, HE NEVER
TOOK HIS EYES OFF ME.

12:55.909 --> 12:59.012
YOU STILL THINK IT'S TOO EARLY
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FATHER?

13:00.881 --> 13:04.184
WHY, BECAUSE HE POPPED
INTO MY HEAD FOR A SECOND?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.652
( laughs )

13:05.752 --> 13:08.388
YOU PEOPLE. WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

13:08.488 --> 13:10.690
I GIVE YOU A LITTLE CRUMB
AND YOU LUNGE AT IT.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.392
NO.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.861
I'M JUST ASKING
MYSELF, ALEX,

13:13.961 --> 13:15.595
WHAT WAS IT
ABOUT THAT OLD MAN

13:15.695 --> 13:18.365
THAT MAKES YOU THINK
ABOUT YOUR FATHER?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.133
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING:

13:20.233 --> 13:22.502
IF THERE'S SOMEONE
WHO DOES NOT KNOW
THE MEANING OF GUILT,

13:22.602 --> 13:24.337
IT'S MY FATHER.
YOU KNOW WHY?

13:24.437 --> 13:26.739
BECAUSE IF HE COULD FEEL,

13:26.840 --> 13:29.709
HE WOULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.913
YOU KNOW, MY FATHER
KILLED HIS FATHER

13:33.013 --> 13:35.983
WITH HIS BARE HANDS.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.218
YEAH.
AND THAT'S A FACT.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.255
MAN, I'D LOVE TO
SEE HIM ON THIS COUCH.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.925
MAN, DOC, YOU'D HAVE
A FIELD DAY WITH HIM.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.130
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.399
OH, NOW I GOT
YOUR ATTENTION.

13:54.201 --> 13:57.905
WELL, I DON'T THINK I CAN
TELL IT AS WELL AS HE DOES.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.672
BUT I'LL TRY.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.876
MID-'50s, RIGHT?
JIM CROW OKLAHOMA.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.547
MY OLD MAN HAD PISSED OFF
THE LOCAL GOOD OL' BOYS

14:07.647 --> 14:11.218
BY TRYING TO ORGANIZE SOME
BLACK LABOR AT THIS FACTORY.

14:11.318 --> 14:14.054
THEY TRIED TO THREATEN HIM
BUT MY DAD DIDN'T BACK DOWN.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.823
HE'S A TOUGH SON OF A BITCH,
I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.

14:16.924 --> 14:19.126
ANYWAY, THE WHOLE THING,
IT JUST ESCALATED.

14:19.226 --> 14:23.030
AND, UH,
THIS MOB WITH HOODS

14:23.130 --> 14:25.165
ATTACKED HIS HOUSE.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.434
MY UNCLE RONNIE WAS ON
THE FRONT PORCH WITH A RIFLE.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.403
THEY SHOT HIM DOWN.
SHOT MY AUNT JEANNIE TOO.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.072
AND THEN THEY CAME INSIDE.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.440
SO MY FATHER TAKES
THE REST OF THE FAMILY,

14:33.540 --> 14:36.009
THEY RUN DOWNSTAIRS
TO THE BOILER ROOM,

14:36.109 --> 14:37.644
TO THE BASEMENT.
RIGHT NEAR THE BOILER,

14:37.744 --> 14:40.713
THEY ALL CRAMMED INTO THIS
AREA, THIS HIDDEN ROOM.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.482
MY GRANDFATHER, HIS FATHER,

14:42.582 --> 14:44.351
WAS VERY SICK,

14:44.451 --> 14:47.287
DYING OF LUNG CANCER.
AND HE HAD THIS, UH,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.389
APPARENTLY HE HAD THIS--
( wheezes )

14:49.489 --> 14:51.959
THIS WHEEZING
AND THIS HACKING COUGH.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.327
SO MY FATHER PUTS HIS HAND

14:54.427 --> 14:56.529
OVER HIS FATHER'S
MOUTH AND NOSE

14:56.629 --> 14:59.099
AND HE KEPT IT THERE WHILE
THEY SEARCHED THE BASEMENT,

14:59.199 --> 15:02.269
KEPT IT CLAMPED TIGHT.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.871
THEN WHEN THEY
FINALLY CLEARED OUT

15:04.972 --> 15:07.007
MY GRANDFATHER WAS DEAD.

15:07.107 --> 15:10.010
HE'D SUFFOCATED.

15:13.813 --> 15:17.050
- THERE IT IS.
- THAT'S, UH...

15:17.150 --> 15:19.052
THAT'S A HORRIFIC STORY.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.021
HE TELLS IT EVERY YEAR
ON MY GRANDFATHER'S BIRTHDAY.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.090
IT'S A TRADITION.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.959
AND YOU REALLY BELIEVE
HE DOESN'T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.694
I'M TELLING YOU,

15:27.794 --> 15:30.697
HE ALWAYS USED
TO SAY, "LEAVE THE GUILT
FOR THE WHITE MAN.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.300
( laughs )
WE CAN'T AFFORD IT."

15:35.235 --> 15:38.238
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT HE'S SAYING THAT

15:38.338 --> 15:41.274
IT'S DANGEROUS
TO FEEL GUILTY,

15:41.374 --> 15:43.843
THAT IT'S
A KIND OF WEAKNESS.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.845
MAYBE THAT'S
A MESSAGE THAT

15:45.945 --> 15:47.414
YOU'VE GROWN UP WITH.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.749
WHAT CAN I SAY?
THAT'S JUST MY FATHER'S WAY.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.685
- BUT IS IT YOUR WAY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.389
HEY, IT WORKS FOR HIM.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.191
DOESN'T NECESSARILY
MAKE HIM AN ASSHOLE.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.061
PEOPLE LOVE MY FATHER.
MY WIFE IS CRAZY ABOUT HIM.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.430
YOU SHOULD SEE HIM
AT FAMILY DINNERS.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.366
HE'S GOT HER OFF IN A CORNER
AND TELLING JOKES AND...

16:06.466 --> 16:08.201
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE APPRECIATES HIM.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.936
- ( water pouring )
- MAYBE THAT'S WHY WE LASTED

16:10.037 --> 16:11.704
AS LONG AS WE DID.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.773
YOU SAY "LASTED"

16:13.873 --> 16:15.275
AS IF IT WAS PAST TENSE.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.645
YEAH.

16:18.745 --> 16:22.115
YEAH, ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHY
I CAME TO SEE YOU TODAY.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.417
THERE'S THIS ISSUE
WITH MY WIFE.

16:24.517 --> 16:28.288
WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
WHEN I CAME HOME FROM MY TRIP,

16:28.388 --> 16:32.092
IT WAS LATE AND THE KIDS
WERE ALREADY ASLEEP.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.897
AND I SAW MY WIFE.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.732
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU SAW YOUR WIFE?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.501
I LOOKED AT HER.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.437
I REALLY LOOKED AT HER.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.575
SHE WAS SLEEPING IN FRONT
OF THE TELEVISION.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.378
FOR AN HOUR, AN HOUR
AND A HALF NONSTOP

16:51.478 --> 16:54.481
I SAT THERE WITHOUT
TAKING MY EYES OFF HER.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.786
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WATCHED YOUR WIFE SLEEP
FOR AN HOUR STRAIGHT?

17:01.688 --> 17:04.424
WELL, I USUALLY FALL ASLEEP
BEFORE SHE DOES.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.127
WELL, TRY IT ONCE,
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.729
WHAT'LL SURPRISE ME?

17:09.829 --> 17:13.032
WHAT YOU'LL DISCOVER...

17:13.133 --> 17:15.535
ABOUT HER,

17:15.635 --> 17:17.270
ABOUT YOURSELF.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.874
I WAS LOOKING AT HER,

17:21.974 --> 17:24.844
LOOKING AT EVERY INCH
OF HER BODY.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.214
AND I SAID TO MYSELF...

17:29.382 --> 17:32.519
"WHO THE HELL IS THIS WOMAN

17:32.619 --> 17:36.423
SLEEPING ON THE SOFA
IN FRONT OF THE TV?

17:36.523 --> 17:39.492
WHAT THE HELL DOES
SHE KNOW ABOUT ME?

17:39.592 --> 17:42.262
WHAT DOES SHE THINK
SHE KNOWS ABOUT ME?

17:42.362 --> 17:45.098
AND WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING

17:45.198 --> 17:47.500
LIVING WITH HER
IN THE SAME LIVING ROOM,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.736
IN THE SAME HOUSE
WITH THE SAME KIDS

17:49.836 --> 17:51.738
FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS?"

17:53.873 --> 17:55.542
UNDERSTAND?

18:00.413 --> 18:03.616
AND I'M SITTING THERE
OPPOSITE HER, RIGHT?

18:03.716 --> 18:05.918
SHE DOESN'T IMAGINE
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH MY HEAD.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.355
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

18:08.455 --> 18:11.591
SHE STARTS GRINDING
HER TEETH.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.260
NOW IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I EVER SAW HER

18:13.360 --> 18:14.961
GRIND HER TEETH
IN HER SLEEP.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.330
AND I'M TALKING
SOMETHING SICK,

18:17.430 --> 18:19.966
FRIGHTENING. THE SOUND
THAT CAME OUT OF HER MOUTH--

18:20.066 --> 18:21.334
IT-- HOW DO YOU--

18:21.434 --> 18:23.870
YOU COULD CUT DIAMONDS
BETWEEN HER TEETH, OKAY?

18:23.970 --> 18:26.105
IT REALLY FUCKED ME UP.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.607
SOUNDS PRETTY UPSETTING.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.809
SHOCKING, I TELL YOU.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.278
AND SUDDENLY I UNDERSTOOD.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.446
FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS
THIS WOMAN'S BEEN SO BUSY

18:33.546 --> 18:35.182
PRETENDING THAT
EVERYTHING'S OKAY,

18:35.282 --> 18:37.684
FLOWING.
SHE'S A MODEL MOTHER,

18:37.784 --> 18:39.686
A MODEL WIFE,

18:39.786 --> 18:42.455
AN OUTSTANDING LECTURER
AT A COMMUNICATIONS COLLEGE.
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

18:42.555 --> 18:44.391
VERY IMPRESSIVE
IN FRONT OF MY FELLOW PILOTS.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.893
AND IT TURNS OUT
SHE TAKES IT ALL OUT

18:46.993 --> 18:49.529
ON HER TEETH AT NIGHT.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.832
WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
PRETTY COMMON, ACTUALLY.

18:52.932 --> 18:56.736
THEY DON'T THINK IT HAS
ANYTHING TO DO WITH STRESS.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.940
IT HAS TO DO WITH FLAWS IN
THE STRUCTURE OF THE JAW.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.442
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

19:02.542 --> 19:05.144
NO, IT'S CONNECTED
TO HER STRESS.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.714
- IN WHAT WAY?
- IN WHAT--

19:09.549 --> 19:13.286
OKAY. SHE IS A TOTALLY
REPRESSED PERSON.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.955
AND ALL HER REPRESSIONS
COME OUT AT NIGHT

19:16.055 --> 19:18.124
IN HER SLEEP.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.592
SO SHE GRINDS HER TEETH.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.093
MMM.

19:21.194 --> 19:24.731
YOU THINK MICHAELA
MAY HAVE TROUBLE WITH
HER FEELINGS TOO?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.199
( laughs )

19:26.299 --> 19:28.535
YOU THINK I DON'T FEEL?
WAIT TILL YOU MEET HER.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.738
EVERYTHING IS JUST
LIKE CLOCKWORK.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.173
CLOCKWORK, THAT'S WHAT--
IT'S CLOCKWORK.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.642
THE KIDS
HAVE BEEN GOING TO BED

19:35.742 --> 19:38.445
AT THE SAME HOUR SINCE
THEY WERE TWO DAYS OLD.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.314
THEY GOT SICK
ON A FIXED DATE.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.783
WE'D HAVE SEX
ON A FIXED DATE

19:43.883 --> 19:46.152
IN A FIXED POSITION.
AND MICHAELA EVEN FARTS

19:46.253 --> 19:48.488
ONCE A YEAR
ON A FIXED DATE.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.558
ONCE A YEAR ON THE NIGHT
AFTER EASTER SUNDAY

19:51.658 --> 19:54.894
SHE FARTS.
SHE LETS HERSELF FART
ONCE, MAYBE TWICE.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.629
A LITTLE ONE,
NOT THAT MUCH.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.299
AND THEN IT'S OVER.
NO FARTING FOR THE REST
OF THE YEAR.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.401
MAN, SHE'S
A PROGRAMMED PERSON.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.504
EVERY EMOTION
IS UNDER CONTROL.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.740
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
A LITTLE ANGRY WITH HER.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.279
NO.
WHAT--

20:12.379 --> 20:15.415
- WHY--
- JUST THE WAY
YOU TALK ABOUT HER.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.251
NO. TAKES A LOT MORE
THAN MICHAELA'S SCHEDULE
TO MAKE ME ANGRY.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.720
I GOT THE IMPRESSION BEFORE
WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING

20:20.820 --> 20:24.357
THAT MAYBE YOU'RE A LITTLE
ANGRY WITH YOURSELF, ALEX.

20:24.457 --> 20:27.427
I MEAN, YOU WENT
ALL THE WAY TO IRAQ

20:27.527 --> 20:29.462
AND YOU COULDN'T FEEL
ANYTHING.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.799
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.404
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO
MICHAELA ABOUT IT?

20:37.504 --> 20:40.373
MMM, OF COURSE.
OVER OUR MORNING COFFEE.

20:40.473 --> 20:43.343
SHE SAYS, "YES, HONEY.
I GRIND MY TEETH.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.979
YOU ONLY NOTICED IT NOW?
YOU ARE SUCH A SWEETHEART.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.181
THAT'S WHAT I'D CALL LOVE."

20:49.282 --> 20:51.684
AND THEN SHE SAID,
"BABY, PLEASE CUT DOWN
ON YOUR COFFEE.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.753
REMEMBER WHAT
THE DOCTOR SAID?"

20:53.853 --> 20:56.789
SINCE MY HEART ATTACK
SHE LETS ME HAVE ONE CUP
OF COFFEE A DAY.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.426
AND THAT BATTERY ACID YOU
GAVE ME, THAT'S NOT COFFEE.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.494
- THAT DOESN'T COUNT.
- OKAY OKAY.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.030
SO YOU DON'T LIKE MICHAELA

21:04.130 --> 21:07.800
WORRYING ABOUT YOU,
TREATING YOU LIKE
YOU'RE SICK?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.569
( sighs )

21:09.669 --> 21:12.605
IT'S JUST--
IT'S LIKE SHE'S ON A MISSION

21:12.705 --> 21:14.907
TO GET ME BACK UP
IN THE AIR ASAP.

21:15.007 --> 21:18.345
SHE SAYS I'M FIT AS A FIDDLE
AND I NEED TO BE KNOCKING ON
THE NAVY'S DOOR TO GET BACK.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.079
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOU'VE FLOWN?

21:20.179 --> 21:21.581
TWO MONTHS
SINCE MY HEART ATTACK.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.417
IT MUST BE HARD
TO BE AWAY FROM THAT WORLD,

21:24.517 --> 21:28.187
NOT TO BE PART
OF WHAT USED TO BE

21:28.287 --> 21:30.323
THE CENTER OF YOUR LIFE.

21:30.423 --> 21:33.092
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M STILL ONE OF THEM, OKAY?
SO YOU CAN RELAX ON THAT.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.995
BUT MEANWHILE,
SITTING AT HOME THINKING
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY

21:36.095 --> 21:38.398
THAT YOU MIGHT
NEVER FLY AGAIN--

21:38.498 --> 21:40.132
OF COURSE I'LL FLY AGAIN.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.134
PEOPLE WITH WORSE INJURIES
HAVE BOUNCED BACK.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.236
DO YOU WANT
TO GO BACK, ALEX?

21:44.337 --> 21:47.106
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

21:47.206 --> 21:49.609
BUT MICHAELA'S DYING
FOR ME TO GO BACK.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.278
AND AT NIGHT SHE GRINDS
HER TEETH LIKE SOME KIND OF--

21:52.379 --> 21:55.882
ALEX, IT'S NOT LIKE SHE
CHANGED OVERNIGHT.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.984
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

21:58.084 --> 22:00.787
I THINK THERE ARE THINGS
ABOUT MICHAELA THAT REALLY
BOTHER YOU

22:00.887 --> 22:04.457
BECAUSE THEY REFLECT
SOMETHING INSIDE YOU

22:04.557 --> 22:05.925
THAT YOU CAN'T LIVE WITH.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.460
LIKE WHAT?

22:07.560 --> 22:10.162
LIKE HER PASSION
FOR YOU TO FLY AGAIN.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.765
I'M NOT 100% CONVINCED

22:12.865 --> 22:14.667
THAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT
TO GO BACK.

22:16.869 --> 22:19.372
MAYBE BECAUSE

22:19.472 --> 22:22.709
YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE
FORGIVING YOURSELF.

22:24.944 --> 22:28.748
OKAY, ALL OF THIS
JUST REINFORCES MY DECISION
TO LEAVE HOME.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.983
WHAT?

22:32.919 --> 22:34.421
WHY?

22:34.521 --> 22:36.789
YEAH, I DON'T THINK--

22:38.425 --> 22:40.693
IT'S POINTLESS TO DRAG
THIS OUT FOR YEARS.

22:40.793 --> 22:43.696
WHEN A PERSON DECIDES HE'S NOT
IN LOVE WITH HIS SPOUSE

22:43.796 --> 22:46.298
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO PUT OFF LEAVING HOME.
ISN'T THAT SO?

22:46.399 --> 22:48.468
IT'S OVER.
IT'S DEAD.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.437
I'VE HAD FRIENDS
WHO'VE REACHED THIS CONCLUSIO.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.172
THEY GO TO THREE YEARS
OF COUPLES THERAPY AND THEY
STILL END UP SEPARATING.

22:53.272 --> 22:55.608
SO WHAT'S THE USE?
I SAY CUT THAT SHIT.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.544
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S A LITTLE EXTREME?

22:57.644 --> 23:00.279
I MEAN, IT IS POSSIBLE
TO OVERCOME A CRISIS.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.115
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I REALIZED?

23:04.383 --> 23:06.753
THAT I WAS NEVER
IN LOVE WITH HER,

23:06.853 --> 23:08.688
WITH MICHAELA.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.023
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

23:11.123 --> 23:13.860
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A TERRIBLE
REALIZATION THAT IS?

23:16.362 --> 23:18.364
WHAT DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO DO?

23:18.465 --> 23:21.568
FIND A LOVER LIKE MY DAD?

23:21.668 --> 23:24.236
START COMING HOME
LATE AT NIGHT?

23:24.336 --> 23:25.972
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A GOOD EXCUSE ANYMORE.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.175
I WON'T DO ANYTHING BUT SIT
ON MY ASS AND WATCH TV.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.978
SO WHAT?

23:34.881 --> 23:36.816
YOU LOOK UPSET.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.818
NO, I'M JUST--

23:40.587 --> 23:42.121
I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED,
THAT'S ALL.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.390
WELL, DON'T BE.
IT'S...

23:44.491 --> 23:46.893
- I FEEL A GREAT RELIEF.
- NO, I'M SURE.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.328
THERE MUST BE
TREMENDOUS RELIEF IN JUST

23:49.428 --> 23:52.198
WALKING AWAY.

23:52.298 --> 23:54.934
BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED
IT'S THE SOLUTION.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.236
WHY NOT?

23:57.336 --> 24:01.307
I SUPPOSE BECAUSE
I ASK MYSELF:

24:01.407 --> 24:03.242
WHO ARE YOU
REALLY LEAVING?

24:03.342 --> 24:04.611
MAYBE YOU'RE LEAVING
HER BECAUSE

24:04.711 --> 24:06.479
SHE'S SUCH A FRIGHTENING
REFLECTION OF YOU.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.915
MAYBE YOU'RE
LEAVING YOURSELF,

24:09.015 --> 24:10.182
NOT YOUR WIFE.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.485
NO.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.053
IT'S IRRELEVANT.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.588
I HAVE NO REASON TO GO BACK.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.690
WE'RE FINISHED.
WE'RE DONE.
WE'RE FINISHED.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.494
HAVE YOU SAID
ANYTHING TO, UH--

24:21.594 --> 24:22.895
TO HER ABOUT IT?

24:22.995 --> 24:25.431
NOT YET.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.199
I THOUGHT I'D CONSULT
WITH YOU FIRST.

24:27.299 --> 24:30.302
IS THIS REALLY
A CONSULTATION?

24:30.402 --> 24:32.304
BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

24:32.404 --> 24:34.574
AGAIN, I FEEL
LIKE I'M A RUBBER STAMP

24:34.674 --> 24:36.308
FOR A DECISION
THAT YOU'VE ALREADY MADE.

24:36.408 --> 24:38.611
NO NO,
ON THE CONTRARY.

24:38.711 --> 24:41.080
THIS MEETING CLINCHED
THE MATTER, NOT BEFORE.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.448
YOU CAN TAKE
CREDIT FOR IT.

24:42.549 --> 24:45.618
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
GIVING ME CREDIT?

24:45.718 --> 24:48.921
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THAT
YOU GIVE ME CREDIT.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.923
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING
IS YOU'RE ASKING ME

24:51.023 --> 24:54.727
TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOUR BIG DECISIONS.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.664
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:57.764 --> 25:00.667
IT'S NOT ME MAKING
THESE DECISIONS, IT'S YOU.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.969
YOU KNEW BEFORE YOU WALKED
THROUGH THAT DOOR

25:03.069 --> 25:04.571
THAT YOU WERE GOING
TO GO BACK TO IRAQ.

25:04.671 --> 25:07.173
YOU KNEW BEFORE YOU EVER
BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT

25:07.273 --> 25:09.341
OF MICHAELA'S TEETH GRINDING

25:09.441 --> 25:11.377
THAT YOUR MARRIAGE
WAS DEEPLY IN TROUBLE.

25:11.477 --> 25:15.514
THESE AREN'T CONCLUSIONS
THAT YOU'VE COME TO HERE
ON THIS COUCH

25:15.615 --> 25:18.117
IN THE LAST WEEK
WITH MY PERMISSION.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.426
AREN'T THESE THINGS
THAT HAVE BEEN

25:27.526 --> 25:29.996
BOILING OVER INSIDE YOU

25:30.096 --> 25:32.064
FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME,
ALEX?

25:38.170 --> 25:40.172
I-I GOT TO GO.

25:41.407 --> 25:43.843
LIKE YOU SAY,
MY TIME IS UP.

25:46.412 --> 25:48.681
( sighs )

25:54.587 --> 25:56.355
HEY, DON'T WORRY.

25:56.455 --> 25:58.825
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.236
( theme music playing )
