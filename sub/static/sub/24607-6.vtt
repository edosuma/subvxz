WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:02.524
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.567 --> 00:04.134
THE VALLEY IS OURS.

00:04.178 --> 00:07.398
AS LONG AS YOU STAY HERE,
WE WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.183
WE'LL COME WITHOUT A FIGHT.

00:09.226 --> 00:11.881
I BET YOU WILL,
TRAITOR.

00:11.924 --> 00:14.536
IF THIS IS THE LAST
LIVING VALLEY ON EARTH,

00:14.579 --> 00:16.146
THEN IT SHOULD BE OURS.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.235
WE CAN'T LET IT GET
INTO HER TORSO.

00:18.279 --> 00:19.062
IT'S MOVING.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.803
OK, THIS IS GONNA HURT.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.500
AAH!

00:22.544 --> 00:23.806
CLARKE: I GOT IT.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.590
AHH.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.201
MONTY, ON RADIO:
THE PRISONERS HAVE

00:27.244 --> 00:28.767
A MISSILE SYSTEM
ON THEIR TRANSPORT SHIP.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.117
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.205
MISSILES?

00:31.248 --> 00:32.684
HIDE SOMEWHERE
AND TAKE COVER.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.208
HIDE FROM AN EYE
IN THE SKY?

00:34.251 --> 00:35.774
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

00:35.818 --> 00:38.429
-FIRE AT WILL.
-FIRE IN THE HOLE.

01:02.888 --> 01:03.933
GROSS.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.109
MADI.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.111
THE INFECTION'S
PASSING,

01:08.155 --> 01:10.505
BUT THIS IS GONNA HURT.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.246
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT JACKSON?

01:12.289 --> 01:15.118
JACKSON'S TENDING TO
INDRA AND THE OTHERS
IN MEDBAY.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.120
JUST DO IT.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.262
CLARKE:
MADI'S A BIG FAN.

01:28.305 --> 01:31.613
SHE'S HEARD EVERY STORY
ABOUT THE GIRL UNDER THE FLOOR

01:31.656 --> 01:33.789
WHO SAVED THE HUMAN RACE.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.399
NOW WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

01:35.443 --> 01:39.534
YOU SURVIVED 6 YEARS
OF RADIATION?

01:40.839 --> 01:42.406
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

01:42.450 --> 01:45.888
SYNTHETIC NIGHTBLOOD,
LIKE ME.

01:45.931 --> 01:49.152
I TOOK HER TO BECCA'S LAB
AND SHARED MY BONE MARROW

01:49.196 --> 01:50.197
TO KEEP HER ALIVE.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.547
YOU'RE LUCKY
CLARKE FOUND YOU.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.465
READY TO MOVE?

01:57.508 --> 01:58.857
SHE NEEDS ANOTHER
DAY'S REST.

01:58.901 --> 02:01.033
SHE NEEDS TO BE
WITH HER PEOPLE.

02:01.077 --> 02:03.035
I'M DONE LICKING
MY WOUNDS.

02:03.079 --> 02:07.518
LET'S GO REMIND
THE OTHERS WHAT
WE PROMISED THEM.

02:26.972 --> 02:30.541
OCTAVIA'S SUCH A BADASS.

02:30.585 --> 02:33.892
I WISH WE DIDN'T
HAVE TO LIE TO HER.

02:35.155 --> 02:39.289
HEY. WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THIS.

02:39.333 --> 02:42.249
WE HAVE TO LIE TO EVERYONE
TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

02:42.292 --> 02:45.121
IF THE GROUNDERS
FIND OUT WHAT YOU ARE,

02:45.165 --> 02:48.646
SOME OF THEM MIGHT TRY
TO REPLACE OCTAVIA WITH YOU.

02:48.690 --> 02:53.608
I CAN'T HAVE YOU CAUGHT UP
IN A POWER STRUGGLE,

02:53.651 --> 02:56.350
ESPECIALLY DURING A WAR.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.370
HUNDREDS ARE STILL
REFUSING TO COME OUT
OF THE BUNKER,

03:16.413 --> 03:18.241
AFRAID THEY'LL BE
BOMBED IN THE STREETS.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.504
YOU SAID THEY NEEDED
TO SEE ME,

03:20.548 --> 03:22.506
BUT THEY CAN BARELY
LOOK AT ME.

03:22.550 --> 03:24.247
WHAT AREN'T YOU
TELLING ME?

03:24.291 --> 03:27.772
WORD HAS SPREAD ABOUT
OUR DEFEAT IN THE WASTELAND.

03:27.816 --> 03:30.471
DIYOZA'S FIREPOWER
HAS CRIPPLED US.

03:30.514 --> 03:31.994
THE SOIL HERE IS DEAD.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.430
I DON'T CARE
HOW MUCH IT RAINS,

03:33.474 --> 03:34.866
IT WON'T BE ARABLE
FOR YEARS.

03:34.910 --> 03:35.998
AND, AS YOU KNOW,
THE HYDROFARM

03:36.041 --> 03:37.260
CAN BARELY PRODUCE
ENOUGH--

03:37.304 --> 03:38.522
STOP IT.

03:38.566 --> 03:41.351
WE HAVE FACED WORSE
ODDS THAN THIS.

03:41.395 --> 03:45.137
YES, BUT NOW WE KNOW
THE WARNING SIGNS
OF REBELLION.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.227
I ONCE BETRAYED YOU
WHEN YOU WERE VULNERABLE,

03:47.270 --> 03:49.141
WHEN WONKRU WAS
LIVING IN FEAR.

03:49.185 --> 03:52.362
LOOK AROUND YOU.
IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN

03:52.406 --> 03:54.277
UNLESS YOU TAKE CONTROL.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.627
BELLAMY: OCTAVIA.

03:58.977 --> 04:01.458
GLAD TO SEE YOU
BACK ON YOUR FEET.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.547
SHE TRIED TO GET IN
TO SEE YOU, BUT
THEY WOULDN'T LET--

04:03.591 --> 04:05.157
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

04:05.201 --> 04:09.074
I JUST WANTED TO
THANK YOU FOR
SAVING MY PEOPLE.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.120
THEY'RE NOT
YOUR PEOPLE.

04:11.163 --> 04:14.645
AZGEDA IS A MEMORY.
THERE IS ONLY WONKRU,

04:14.689 --> 04:16.604
AND THERE IS NO PLACE
IN IT FOR YOU.

04:16.647 --> 04:19.781
BELLAMY:
I KNOW YOU TWO
HAVE HISTORY,

04:19.824 --> 04:22.000
BUT ECHO IS ON
OUR SIDE.

04:22.044 --> 04:26.483
SHE PROVED HERSELF
DOZENS OF TIMES ON
THE RING.

04:26.527 --> 04:28.224
THIS ISN'T THE RING.

04:28.268 --> 04:32.663
WONKRU, I BANISHED
THIS MURDERER

04:32.707 --> 04:35.579
FROM THE BUNKER
6 YEARS AGO.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.668
MY JUDGMENT
STILL STANDS.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.583
BELLAMY: O.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.672
SHE HAS 24 HOURS.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.588
IF SHE'S STILL HERE
BY THEN,

04:44.632 --> 04:46.938
SHE FIGHTS IN THE ARENA.

04:50.551 --> 04:53.293
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.386
OCTAVIA!

04:59.429 --> 05:00.735
OCTAVIA, STOP.

05:00.778 --> 05:03.651
IT WAS 6 YEARS AGO.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.696
YOU JUST CAN'T
CAST HER OUT.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.569
SHE WON'T SURVIVE.

05:12.268 --> 05:13.617
DIYOZA'S SHIP.

05:17.055 --> 05:19.797
MAN: MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

05:19.841 --> 05:23.148
BELLAMY. BELLAMY,
GET IN THE BUNKER.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.717
NOT WITHOUT ECHO.

05:29.546 --> 05:32.419
COOPER: BLODREINA, YOU HAVE
TO GET BELOW GROUND, TOO.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.463
ECHO!

05:33.507 --> 05:36.336
ECHO: BELLAMY!

05:41.428 --> 05:43.952
COOPER:
BLODREINA, LOOK.

05:58.009 --> 06:00.403
DIYOZA OVER LOUDSPEAKER:
PEOPLE OF WONKRU,

06:00.447 --> 06:04.973
THIS IS COLONEL DIYOZA
OFFERING YOU A CHANCE FOR PEACE.

06:05.016 --> 06:09.369
I KNOW YOU ALL SUFFERED,
I KNOW YOU'RE HUNGRY,

06:09.412 --> 06:13.416
AND SO MANY OF YOU ARE
WEARY OF OCTAVIA'S RULE,

06:13.460 --> 06:16.593
BUT NOW YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

06:16.637 --> 06:19.030
ABANDON YOUR WEAPONS,
LEAVE WONKRU BEHIND,

06:19.074 --> 06:21.076
AND JOIN US IN
SHALLOW VALLEY.

06:21.119 --> 06:24.427
WE HAVE PLENTY OF FOOD
AND SHELTER FOR THOSE

06:24.471 --> 06:25.472
SEEKING A BETTER LIFE.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.821
SHE'S RECRUITING.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.431
DIYOZA: WHEN OUR SHIP
RETURNS TONIGHT,

06:28.475 --> 06:29.824
HEAD FOR THE WASTELANDS.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.653
ANYONE WAITING FOR US
OUTSIDE THE RUINS

06:32.696 --> 06:33.741
WILL BE RESCUED.

06:33.784 --> 06:36.439
BUT COME UNARMED.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.398
IF OCTAVIA ATTACKS
OUR SHIP,

06:38.441 --> 06:42.576
WE WILL RETALIATE AGAINST
YOUR CITY WITH LETHAL FORCE.

06:42.619 --> 06:46.580
WE'RE WATCHING EVERYTHING,
ALWAYS.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.452
THERE IS A PLACE IN
THE VALLEY FOR ALL OF US,

06:49.496 --> 06:52.890
SO PLEASE CHOOSE WISELY.

07:25.488 --> 07:28.360
DIYOZA: IF WHAT YOU SAY
ABOUT THE FARM IS TRUE,

07:28.404 --> 07:30.711
THIS WON'T MAKE HER
ANY FRIENDS.

07:30.754 --> 07:31.668
NO, THIS IS THEATER.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.453
SHE KNOWS WE'RE
STILL WATCHING.

07:33.496 --> 07:36.456
SHE WANTS US TO THINK
SHE'S STILL IN CONTROL.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.849
OR SHE IS IN CONTROL
AND YOU'RE NOT AS USEFUL

07:38.893 --> 07:42.505
AS YOUR GIRLFRIEND
AFTER ALL.

07:42.549 --> 07:45.029
RELAX, KANE.

07:45.073 --> 07:48.555
FOSTERING DISSENT
IS LIKE SEDUCTION,

07:48.598 --> 07:51.253
IT TAKES TIME.

07:53.647 --> 07:56.171
ANYTHING?

07:56.214 --> 07:57.564
HMM.

07:57.607 --> 08:02.656
DON'T WORRY,
THERE ARE CAVES
ALL OVER THIS VALLEY.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.222
MURPHY'S IN ONE
OF THEM.

08:04.266 --> 08:07.487
AS SOON AS HE SURFACES,
HE DIES.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.014
HEY.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.238
WHAT IS THIS?

08:20.282 --> 08:23.633
WE NEED A PLACE TO
HOUSE THE DEFECTORS.

08:23.677 --> 08:24.547
DEFECTORS?

08:24.591 --> 08:27.202
YOU AND YOUR POLITICS.

08:27.245 --> 08:30.510
TWO MISSILES AND THIS
WAR WOULD BE OVER.

08:30.553 --> 08:31.554
AND THEN WHAT?

08:31.598 --> 08:35.906
HOW MANY OF OUR PEOPLE
ARE FARMERS?

08:35.950 --> 08:38.474
HOW MANY ARE ENGINEERS?

08:38.518 --> 08:42.217
KANE: HOW MANY ARE EXPECTED
TO DIE OF A MYSTERY VIRUS?

08:44.915 --> 08:46.700
SAY THAT AGAIN.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.528
STAND DOWN,
MCCREARY.

08:48.571 --> 08:51.313
ABBY'S WORKING
AROUND THE CLOCK

08:51.356 --> 08:53.924
TO FIND A CURE
FOR YOU AND THE OTHERS.

08:53.968 --> 08:58.668
YOU KILL KANE AND ALL
THAT GOES AWAY.

09:01.845 --> 09:04.935
YOU THINK WE'RE DIVIDING
THEIR FORCES,

09:04.979 --> 09:08.112
BUT HE IS DIVIDING OURS.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.598
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO WIN THIS WAR.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.209
"IN WAR, THE GREATEST
VICTORY IS ONE

09:18.253 --> 09:20.908
THAT REQUIRES NO BATTLE."

09:20.951 --> 09:24.389
SUN TZU.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.049
WE HAVE EVERYTHING--

09:32.093 --> 09:35.923
THE VALLEY, THE WEAPONS,

09:35.966 --> 09:37.664
THE EYE IN THE SKY.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.666
THEY HAVE NOTHING.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.842
THEY'RE ALREADY HUNGRY,

09:41.885 --> 09:45.323
AND NOW THEY'RE WATCHING
THEIR LEADER BURN FOOD.

09:45.367 --> 09:48.718
WE'RE THE ONLY THING
THAT CAN DEFEAT US.

09:50.285 --> 09:53.549
IT MUST BE HARD...

09:53.593 --> 09:57.074
BEING A VISIONARY SURROUNDED
BY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SEE.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.600
STORY OF MY LIFE.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.645
DIYOZA, ON P.A.: I KNOW
YOU'VE ALL SUFFERED.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.908
I KNOW YOU'RE HUNGRY AND--

10:06.606 --> 10:08.999
THAT MIGHT BE DIYOZA'S VOICE,
BUT THOSE ARE KANE'S WORDS.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.698
HE KNOWS WHERE WE'RE
VULNERABLE AND HE'S
SHARING IT WITH THE ENEMY.

10:11.741 --> 10:13.700
COOPER: WE NEED TO ASSUME
OTHERS WILL BE WILLING
TO DO THE SAME.

10:13.743 --> 10:17.181
IN THE ARENA, KANE
OPENLY DEFIED YOU
TO STIR DISSENT,

10:17.225 --> 10:19.836
AND DISSENT SPREADS
LIKE ANY VIRUS.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.361
I WANT PATROLS
ALONG THE PERIMETER
AROUND THE CLOCK.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.972
WHEN THAT SHIP
COMES BACK,

10:25.015 --> 10:27.583
ANYONE CAUGHT
BEYOND THE RUINS--

10:27.627 --> 10:30.281
MILLER: THIS IS
A PRIVATE MEETING.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.762
OCTAVIA:
IT'S FINE.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.984
WE ALL HAVE PEOPLE
IN THAT VALLEY

10:37.027 --> 10:38.246
THAT NEED OUR HELP.

10:38.289 --> 10:39.987
IF YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER,

10:40.030 --> 10:42.424
I AM NOT INTERESTED
IN RESCUING TRAITORS.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.600
I'M TRYING TO PREVENT
MORE OF THEM.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.734
YOUR PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY
AND YOU'RE WORRYING
ABOUT DEFECTORS?

10:47.777 --> 10:50.737
WE SHOULD STOP WASTING
TIME LOOKING FOR ENEMIES
IN POLIS,

10:50.780 --> 10:53.609
AND WE SHOULD START
TRYING TO FIND A WAY
BACK TO THAT VALLEY.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.612
LAST TIME I CHECKED,
DIYOZA CAN SEE
OUR EVERY MOVE.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.223
THAT'S WHERE MONTY
COMES IN.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.837
LASER-COM.
IT'S DIALED RIGHT
INTO THEIR MOTHER SHIP.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.969
ALL I NEED IS A RELAY
TOWER ON THE GROUND

11:06.013 --> 11:07.754
THAT WE BUILD OUT OF SCRAP
AND A COMPUTER.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.930
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO
BLIND THE EYE
FROM RIGHT HERE.

11:09.973 --> 11:13.107
MILLER: GOOD PLAN.
ONCE IT'S DOWN,
WE CAN ATTACK.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.936
FINE. MILLER
SET MONTY UP.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.155
COOPER, SHOOT ANYONE
WHO TRIES TO DEFECT.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.723
WE'RE DONE HERE.
TIME TO TRAIN.

11:28.470 --> 11:31.516
THAT IS NOT MY SISTER.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.736
CHANGE MY MIND,
YOU MEAN? NO.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.303
BELLAMY: CLARKE?

11:35.346 --> 11:38.436
I'M SORRY,
I HAVE TO GO.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.485
CLARKE: MADI.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.922
MADI: HEY, CLARKE.
GAIA WAS TELLING ME

11:45.966 --> 11:47.707
ABOUT WONKRU
COMBAT TACTICS.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.797
GAIA: ACCORDING TO MADI,
SHE'S ENCOUNTERED OUR ENEMY.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.060
PERHAPS SHE COULD TRAIN
WITH OUR NOVITIATES

11:53.103 --> 11:54.801
AND TELL THEM ABOUT IT.

11:54.844 --> 11:58.326
THANK YOU, BUT MADI'S
NOT WONKRU.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.980
SHE'S SHALLOW VALLEY.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.634
SO THAT'S HOW
YOU SURVIVED.

12:02.678 --> 12:06.029
IS IT TRUE THAT
PRAIMFAYA MISSED
THE ENTIRE VALLEY?

12:06.073 --> 12:10.381
YES, BUT THAT'S NOT
HOW I SURVIVED.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.862
CLARKE USED HER BONE MARROW
TO MAKE ME A NIGHTBLOOD.

12:12.906 --> 12:15.082
HMM.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.997
I OWE HER MY LIFE.

12:17.040 --> 12:21.653
GAIA, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE US...

12:30.401 --> 12:32.055
I TOLD YOU NOT TO
GO EASY.

12:32.099 --> 12:35.624
BELLAMY: MAYBE YOU SHOULD
FIGHT SOMEONE WHO'S NOT
AFRAID OF YOU.

12:36.712 --> 12:40.542
COOPER, GIVE HIM
YOUR SWORD.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.285
YOUR FUNERAL.

12:48.289 --> 12:51.292
SURE YOU'RE UP
FOR THIS?

13:01.171 --> 13:02.607
YOU FIGHT LIKE AZGEDA.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.827
NOT A LOT TO DO
IN SPACE FOR 6 YEARS,

13:04.871 --> 13:06.829
PICKED UP A FEW THINGS.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.487
LET'S GET SOMETHING
STRAIGHT.

13:12.530 --> 13:16.926
IF ECHO LEAVES,
I AM GOING WITH HER.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.758
AHH!

13:24.194 --> 13:26.327
SHE IS NOT YOUR ENEMY.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.895
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.

13:28.938 --> 13:33.029
I KNOW WHAT SHE'S DONE.

13:33.073 --> 13:35.162
GINA AT MOUNT WEATHER.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.164
AHH!

13:37.207 --> 13:39.427
ILIAN IN THE CONCLAVE.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.995
ME ON THAT DAMN CLIFF.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.439
WE ALL HAVE THINGS
TO ANSWER FOR,

13:51.482 --> 13:54.007
THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T
BE FORGIVEN BUT ARE

13:54.050 --> 13:56.879
BECAUSE WE DID THEM
FOR OUR PEOPLE,

13:56.923 --> 13:58.185
OUR FAMILY.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.882
ECHO IS NO DIFFERENT.

13:59.926 --> 14:03.494
SHE WAS AN AZGEDA SPY,
BUT NOW SHE'S WITH ME,

14:03.538 --> 14:05.670
YOUR BROTHER WHO
IS TRYING VERY HARD

14:05.714 --> 14:07.498
TO UNDERSTAND WHO
YOU ARE NOW COMPARED

14:07.542 --> 14:11.720
TO WHO YOU WERE
6 YEARS AGO.

14:13.156 --> 14:16.899
ALL I'M ASKING IS
FOR YOU TO DO THE SAME.

14:23.297 --> 14:25.125
WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.996
YOU'RE NOT GOING
WITH ME.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.520
LIKE HELL I'M NOT.
WE SURVIVE TOGETHER,

14:29.564 --> 14:32.132
ALL OF US, LIKE ALWAYS.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.221
-MONTY AND HARPER
ARE COMING, TOO?
-YES.

14:34.264 --> 14:35.962
-NO.
-ECHO.

14:36.005 --> 14:39.530
YOU ARE NOT DYING FOR ME,
AND NEITHER ARE THEY.

14:39.574 --> 14:42.533
YOUR SISTER NEEDS
YOU HERE, BELLAMY.

14:42.577 --> 14:45.101
SHE'S FIGHTING AN ENEMY
SHE CAN'T BEAT,

14:45.145 --> 14:48.235
AND NOW DIYOZA IS
USING THE FACT THAT
HER PEOPLE KNOW IT

14:48.278 --> 14:51.368
TO PULL THEM APART.

14:53.370 --> 14:57.809
SO WHAT WOULD YOU
DO ABOUT IT, SPY?

14:59.855 --> 15:01.726
THE TRUTH?

15:01.770 --> 15:03.163
SURRENDER.

15:03.206 --> 15:06.035
ONLY A FOOL FIGHTS
A WAR THEY CAN'T WIN.

15:06.079 --> 15:09.256
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.692
SPY FOR ME.

15:10.735 --> 15:13.695
WHEN THAT SHIP
COMES BACK TONIGHT,

15:13.738 --> 15:15.392
PEOPLE WILL TRY
TO DEFECT,

15:15.436 --> 15:17.046
AND I CAN'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.048
BELLAMY: OCTAVIA, THAT
IS NOT WHAT I MEANT.

15:19.092 --> 15:22.269
ECHO:
NO, BUT IT'S SMART.

15:22.312 --> 15:24.010
IF NO ONE GOES
FOR THE SHIP,

15:24.053 --> 15:26.621
DIYOZA WILL THINK
WONKRU'S STILL UNIFIED.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.579
SHE'LL LOSE FAITH
IN KANE.

15:28.623 --> 15:31.669
WHAT HAPPENS
TO THE PEOPLE
THAT SHE TURNS IN?

15:33.106 --> 15:36.283
OCTAVIA: ROOT OUT THE TRAITORS,
BRING ME THEIR NAMES

15:36.326 --> 15:37.588
BEFORE THEY DEFECT,

15:37.632 --> 15:41.505
AND YOUR BANISHMENT
IS LIFTED.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.994
LOOK, IT'S BEEN 3 HOURS.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.735
MAYBE THIS THING DOESN'T
WORK UNDERGROUND.

15:53.778 --> 15:57.086
IT'S POSSIBLE.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.829
I GUESS CAVES ARE
KIND OF OUR THING, HUH?

16:00.872 --> 16:04.833
SHUT UP, JOHN.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.226
SIT STILL.

16:06.269 --> 16:08.663
WHOA, WHOA.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
BAD, BAD IDEA.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.230
I SAID, STOP MOVING.

16:10.273 --> 16:13.059
IF I CAN GET INTO
THE ACCESS PANEL,

16:13.102 --> 16:17.237
MAYBE I COULD SHUT
THIS STUPID THING OFF.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.283
AAH!

16:20.327 --> 16:24.026
SO MUCH FOR RAVEN'S
STAR STUDENT, HUH?

16:26.724 --> 16:29.684
LOOK...

16:29.727 --> 16:32.208
SHE'S GONNA BE OK.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.254
AT LEAST WE KNOW
SHE'S ALIVE.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.386
IT'S HONESTLY MORE THAN
WE CAN SAY FOR THE OTHERS.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.433
WHAT?

16:39.476 --> 16:41.870
NOTHING.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.046
I CAN DO THIS.
I JUST...

16:44.090 --> 16:47.876
I JUST NEED SOME
BETTER TOOLS
AND MAYBE SOME...

16:47.919 --> 16:50.487
MAYBE SOME WHAT?

16:50.531 --> 16:52.794
SOME GLOVES.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.622
THERE WERE SOME GLOVES
IN BECCA'S CAPSULE.

16:54.665 --> 16:58.887
OH, GREAT, THEN ONLY
ONE OF US GETS TO BE
ELECTROCUTED.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.062
-AWESOME PLAN.
-COME ON.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.890
WE'RE GOING TO
THE ROCKET.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.283
NO, NO, NO.
SLOW DOWN, OK?

17:03.326 --> 17:05.154
IF WE GO OUTSIDE AND
THE SIGNAL COMES BACK ONLINE,

17:05.198 --> 17:06.068
THEY'LL FIND US.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.549
WRONG.
THEY'LL FIND YOU.

17:08.592 --> 17:09.898
RIGHT.

17:09.941 --> 17:13.075
SO WE BETTER MOVE FAST.

17:25.174 --> 17:27.350
MCCREARY: LET'S GO HUNTING.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.309
LET'S GO.

17:36.968 --> 17:39.493
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:39.536 --> 17:41.843
WE JUST WANT
TO TALK.

17:41.886 --> 17:45.238
I'M TARIK.
THIS IS KARINA.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.111
WE SAW BLODREINA
CAST YOU OUT.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.026
WHERE WILL YOU GO?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.941
I HAVEN'T FIGURED
THAT PART OUT.

17:52.984 --> 17:55.987
WE HAVE.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.259
IF WE HAD THE COURAGE,
WE WOULD HAVE LEFT
WITH KANE,

18:06.302 --> 18:09.871
BUT NOW WE HAVE
A SECOND CHANCE
TO GO HOME.

18:09.914 --> 18:12.003
IF OCTAVIA CATCHES YOU,
SHE'LL KILL YOU.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.005
LIVING WITH WHAT WE'VE
DONE TO SURVIVE

18:14.049 --> 18:16.965
IS WORSE THAN DEATH.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.228
THIS IS A CHANCE
TO START AGAIN,

18:19.272 --> 18:22.318
TO START OUR FAMILY
WHERE WE'RE FREE.

18:22.362 --> 18:25.016
WE'RE NOT ALONE.
OTHERS ARE LEAVING, TOO.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.976
WILL YOU JOIN US?

18:36.376 --> 18:38.987
WOULD YOU
STOP PACING?

18:39.030 --> 18:41.468
CAN YOU DO IT
OR NOT?

18:41.511 --> 18:43.948
I HAVE ACCESS TO
THE MOTHER SHIP FROM
THE LASER-COM,

18:43.992 --> 18:45.559
BUT EVERYTHING'S
ENCRYPTED, SO NO.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.213
WHEN WE WERE UP THERE,
I COULD HAVE OPENED
A BACKDOOR

18:47.256 --> 18:49.040
FROM THE INSIDE,
BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW

18:49.084 --> 18:50.172
THEY HAD A DAMN CAMERA!

18:50.216 --> 18:51.956
HEY, HEY, MONTY.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.088
TAKE IT EASY.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.350
LOOK, WHY ARE WE
EVEN DOING THIS?

18:54.394 --> 18:56.091
SO YOUR SISTER
CAN GO TO WAR?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.006
WHAT HAPPENED TO US
BEING THE GOOD GUYS?

18:58.049 --> 18:59.355
-WE ARE.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.227
LETTING HER KILL PEOPLE
FOR DEFECTING.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.272
CORRECTION--THINKING
ABOUT DEFECTING.

19:03.316 --> 19:05.361
RAVEN'S A PRISONER.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.320
MURPHY HAS A SHOCK COLLAR
AROUND HIS NECK

19:07.363 --> 19:09.148
AND IS ALONE IN THE WOODS
WITH EMORI.

19:09.191 --> 19:13.021
THIS...THIS IS HOW
WE GET BACK TO THEM.

19:13.064 --> 19:16.198
COME ON, JUST TRY AGAIN.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.722
I'M TELLING YOU,
I CAN'T DO IT FROM HERE.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.032
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

19:24.075 --> 19:25.207
NO TAKERS?

19:25.251 --> 19:26.991
ECHO: OH, NO,
THERE WERE TAKERS.

19:27.035 --> 19:29.037
I'M JUST NOT
TURNING THEM IN.

19:32.475 --> 19:35.261
SOME BAD THINGS WENT
ON DOWN HERE, BELLAMY.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.306
NO ONE WILL
TALK ABOUT IT,

19:37.350 --> 19:40.222
NOT EVEN THE ONES
THAT WANT TO DEFECT.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.615
I CAN SEE IT IN
THEIR FACES.

19:41.658 --> 19:46.968
I'M SORRY. I KNOW THIS
MEANS I'LL BE BANISHED,

19:47.011 --> 19:49.579
BUT I CAN'T DO IT.

19:54.105 --> 19:55.890
THEN LET'S
DEFECT WITH THEM.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.283
MONTY: BELLAMY.

19:57.326 --> 19:58.806
BELLAMY: YOU SAID
YOU CAN'T DO IT FROM HERE,

19:58.849 --> 20:02.418
BUT WE COULD DO THIS IF
WE HAD INSIDE HELP, RIGHT?

20:05.291 --> 20:07.162
I COULD PUT THE BACKDOOR
CODE IN A THUMB DRIVE.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.598
ECHO: BELLAMY,
OCTAVIA'S NOT JOKING

20:08.642 --> 20:11.253
WHEN SHE SAID DEFECTORS
WILL BE SHOT.

20:11.297 --> 20:15.257
ADMITTEDLY,
NOT A PERFECT PLAN.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.182
NIYLAH: CLARKE.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.141
CLARKE, YOU AWAKE?

20:33.144 --> 20:35.625
YEAH. AHEM.

20:35.669 --> 20:38.541
SHH. MADI'S SLEEPING.

20:42.153 --> 20:45.069
AM I CRAZY OR ARE
YOU AVOIDING ME?

20:45.113 --> 20:49.291
NO. I'M SORRY.

20:49.335 --> 20:55.210
IT'S JUST EVERYTHING'S
SO DIFFERENT.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.300
NOT SO DIFFERENT.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.436
YOU SAVED OUR
LIVES AGAIN.

21:03.479 --> 21:06.090
THANK YOU, BY THE WAY.

21:06.134 --> 21:10.138
THAT WASN'T ME.
THAT WAS BELLAMY.

21:10.181 --> 21:13.968
I WAS READY TO GO
TO WAR TO PROTECT HER.

21:14.011 --> 21:17.058
LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH
FOUND NEW FAMILIES.

21:17.101 --> 21:20.148
SO YOU'RE HAPPY HERE?

21:20.191 --> 21:22.281
IT WAS HARD
FOR A WHILE,

21:22.324 --> 21:25.153
REALLY HARD,

21:25.196 --> 21:27.155
BUT WE SURVIVED,

21:27.198 --> 21:29.157
THANKS TO OCTAVIA.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.812
YOU MEAN BLODREINA.

21:31.855 --> 21:35.337
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE SUN
TO SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER SEEN IT?

21:38.122 --> 21:40.386
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE FLAME?

21:40.429 --> 21:42.475
WHAT ABOUT IT?

21:42.518 --> 21:44.520
THE TIME OF
THE COMMANDERS IS OVER.

21:44.564 --> 21:48.568
DOES GAIA
STILL HAVE IT?

21:48.611 --> 21:53.355
THEY SAY YOU MADE HER
INTO A NATBLIDA.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.183
IS THAT TRUE?

21:55.226 --> 21:57.490
YEAH.

21:57.533 --> 22:00.710
I CAN STILL TELL
WHEN YOU'RE LYING.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.126
GAIA?

22:25.169 --> 22:26.432
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

22:26.475 --> 22:30.436
PROTECTING THE LAST
TRUE NATBLIDA,

22:30.479 --> 22:33.395
AS MY ORDER HAS
ALWAYS DONE.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.801
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

22:47.844 --> 22:50.804
WHAT ARE YOU,
FLEIMKEPA OR WONKRU?

22:50.847 --> 22:52.414
BLODREINA SAVED MY LIFE,

22:52.458 --> 22:54.938
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN FORGET MY FAITH.

22:54.982 --> 22:57.201
YOU ARE OUT
OF YOUR MIND

22:57.245 --> 22:59.290
IF YOU THINK I'M GONNA
LET YOU KILL MY FRIEND.

22:59.334 --> 23:02.032
NIYLAH IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.817
YOU'RE WONKRU
OR YOU'RE THE ENEMY.

23:03.860 --> 23:06.167
THAT'S WHAT SHE BELIEVES.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.821
IF YOU WANT
TO PROTECT MADI,

23:07.864 --> 23:10.040
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.868
-I SAID NO.
-CLARKE.

23:11.912 --> 23:15.219
MADI IS NOT A THREAT
TO OCTAVIA.

23:15.263 --> 23:18.048
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

23:19.789 --> 23:22.662
SHE'S A CHILD.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.577
YES, A NIGHTBLOOD CHILD

23:24.620 --> 23:27.536
WHO APPEARED TWO DAYS
AFTER WE ROSE FROM THE ASHES.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.843
THAT'S NO COINCIDENCE,
CLARKE.

23:29.886 --> 23:32.976
OCTAVIA'S NOT GONNA
SEE IT THAT WAY,

23:33.020 --> 23:35.849
AND NEITHER DO I.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.285
LISTEN TO ME.

23:37.328 --> 23:40.114
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
FORCE THE FLAME ON MADI--

23:40.157 --> 23:41.463
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.857
AND I'M NOT THE ONE
YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID OF.

23:49.950 --> 23:54.041
GO, BEFORE SHE
SEES YOU.

23:57.218 --> 23:59.568
I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

24:01.396 --> 24:03.442
SO DO I.

24:11.928 --> 24:15.541
CLARKE.
WHAT HAPPENED?

24:15.584 --> 24:17.804
SOMEONE TRIED TO
ATTACK YOU.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.632
I DIDN'T SEE
HIS FACE.

24:19.675 --> 24:23.418
WHY WOULD ONE OF YOUR
OWN PEOPLE WANT TO DO THAT?

24:23.462 --> 24:27.509
THESE ARE DANGEROUS
TIMES FOR ALL OF US.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.032
EVEN MADI?

24:29.076 --> 24:30.730
I'M SORRY, MY FRIEND,

24:30.773 --> 24:35.474
BUT A TRUE NIGHTBLOOD
COULD TEAR WONKRU APART.

24:37.432 --> 24:41.871
GIVE ME TILL MORNING
TO TELL OCTAVIA MYSELF.

24:41.915 --> 24:44.352
IF YOU TELL THE TRUTH,
SHE WILL SHOW MERCY.

24:44.395 --> 24:45.919
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT?

24:45.962 --> 24:49.923
NO, BUT I DO HOPE IT.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.844
ALL RIGHT,
JUST HOLD STILL.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.976
DON'T GIVE ME
THAT LOOK.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.632
I WAS STARTING TO
GET THE HANG OF THIS.

25:04.981 --> 25:05.939
AAH!

25:05.982 --> 25:07.549
-DAMMIT!

25:07.593 --> 25:09.638
NOW YOU'RE JUST DOING IT
TO ME ON PURPOSE.

25:09.682 --> 25:10.857
ARE YOU CRAZY?

25:10.900 --> 25:14.861
I DON'T ENJOY SEEING
YOU SUFFER, JOHN.

25:14.904 --> 25:17.167
THEN WHY'D
YOU LEAVE ME?

25:17.211 --> 25:20.083
BECAUSE YOU BROKE
MY HEART.

25:23.086 --> 25:26.089
WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

25:26.133 --> 25:29.397
IT'S COMPLICATED.
I NEED A MINUTE TO THINK.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.532
HELL, YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO ENDED THINGS WITH
ME, EMORI.

25:33.575 --> 25:34.881
REMEMBER THAT?

25:34.924 --> 25:38.972
AFTER YOU PUSHED ME AWAY
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

25:39.015 --> 25:40.669
TILL I HAD NO CHOICE.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.453
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU
DIDN'T NEED ME ANYMORE.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.978
YOU WERE ALWAYS OFF WITH RAVEN
DOING YOUR OWN THING.

25:45.021 --> 25:48.677
SO WHAT?

25:48.721 --> 25:51.201
YOU WERE JEALOUS?

26:00.863 --> 26:02.996
WHEN WE WERE
ON THE RING,

26:03.039 --> 26:06.652
I WAS PART OF SOMETHING
BIGGER THAN MYSELF.

26:06.695 --> 26:09.916
I DIDN'T KNOW
I NEEDED THAT,

26:09.959 --> 26:12.614
BUT I DID.

26:12.658 --> 26:16.009
AND YOU PUNISHED ME
FOR IT.

26:18.838 --> 26:22.015
THE RING'S STARTING
TO LOOK PRETTY GOOD
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.758
HOW MUCH FUEL'S
LEFT IN THIS THING?

26:25.801 --> 26:27.498
NOT ENOUGH.

26:27.542 --> 26:30.240
WHY? WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING?

26:32.112 --> 26:34.941
OCTAVIA: SO, WHAT
DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?

26:34.984 --> 26:37.160
NOTHING YOU'RE
GONNA LIKE.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.423
I'M NOT TURNING
PEOPLE IN

26:39.467 --> 26:40.903
SO YOU CAN
EXECUTE THEM.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.775
A SPY AND A MURDERER
WITH A CONSCIENCE.

26:42.818 --> 26:45.429
YOU'RE RIGHT, BELLAMY,
SHE HAS CHANGED.

26:45.473 --> 26:48.432
COOPER: DO YOU HAVE
THE NAMES OR NOT?

26:48.476 --> 26:50.696
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.
MONTY WAS WRONG.

26:50.739 --> 26:53.394
HE CAN'T HACK
THE EYE FROM HERE,

26:53.437 --> 26:55.309
NOT WITHOUT
INSIDE HELP.

26:55.352 --> 26:56.789
SO YOU'VE BOTH FAILED.

26:56.832 --> 27:00.836
NOT EXACTLY.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.055
WHAT IS THAT?

27:02.098 --> 27:03.796
INSIDE HELP.

27:03.839 --> 27:05.145
THERE'S A PROGRAM ON IT

27:05.188 --> 27:06.755
WHICH OPENS THE BACKDOOR
TO THEIR SYSTEMS,

27:06.799 --> 27:09.976
GIVING US CONTROL OF
THE CAMERA ON THEIR
MOTHER SHIP.

27:10.019 --> 27:12.108
MONTY SAYS IT'S
EASY TO USE

27:12.152 --> 27:15.590
IF WE CAN GET INSIDE
THEIR FIREWALL.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.679
YOU WANT ME TO LET
YOU DEFECT?

27:17.723 --> 27:20.682
EITHER THAT OR YOUR PEOPLE
STARVE TO DEATH HERE IN POLIS

27:20.726 --> 27:23.076
WHEN YOUR FARM
STOPS PRODUCING.

27:23.119 --> 27:24.643
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

27:24.686 --> 27:27.080
I'M NOT SENDING YOU
ON A SUICIDE MISSION.

27:27.123 --> 27:28.472
OCTAVIA--

27:28.516 --> 27:29.735
DIYOZA KNOWS WHO
YOU ARE.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.258
SHE KNOWS YOU'RE
MY BROTHER.

27:31.301 --> 27:34.000
SHE'LL NEVER BELIEVE
YOU'RE A DEFECTOR.

27:34.043 --> 27:35.436
SHE'LL BELIEVE ME.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.046
I ALREADY HAVE
THE PERFECT COVER.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.700
I'M BANISHED.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.354
THE DEFECTORS THINK
I'M ONE OF THEM.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.704
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS LET ME GO ALONE.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.097
I DON'T LIKE IT.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.752
LETTING TRAITORS GO
WILL PROMOTE DISSENT.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.754
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S A POLITICAL SACRIFICE,

27:48.797 --> 27:53.280
BUT A NECESSARY ONE
IF YOU WANT YOUR PEOPLE
TO SURVIVE.

27:57.501 --> 28:00.287
CALL OFF THE PATROLS.

28:01.462 --> 28:02.985
THAT'S AN ORDER.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.335
BUT ONCE YOU'RE
ON THAT SHIP,

28:05.379 --> 28:07.990
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

28:08.034 --> 28:10.253
IF YOU'RE DISCOVERED

28:10.297 --> 28:14.518
OR YOU FAIL TO
TAKE DOWN THE EYE,

28:14.562 --> 28:17.870
NO ONE IS COMING TO SAVE YOU.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.968
THE LATEST
GROUNDER FASHION

28:29.011 --> 28:30.970
WITH ONE SMALL
MODIFICATION.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.189
THE JUMP DRIVE
IS HIDDEN INSIDE.

28:33.233 --> 28:34.321
CLEVER.

28:34.364 --> 28:35.409
ONCE YOU'RE ON
THE INSIDE,

28:35.452 --> 28:36.715
GET IT TO RAVEN.

28:36.758 --> 28:40.153
SHE'LL KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

28:40.196 --> 28:42.895
DON'T GET
KILLED, OK?

28:42.938 --> 28:45.767
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO LIKED MY ALGAE.

28:45.811 --> 28:49.292
ACTUALLY, I WAS
JUST BEING POLITE.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.916
I'VE GOT THIS.

29:03.959 --> 29:05.569
YEAH, I KNOW.

29:05.613 --> 29:09.225
SO ONCE THE EYE'S DOWN,
IT'LL TAKE AT LEAST 6 DAYS

29:09.269 --> 29:11.706
FOR OCTAVIA AND HER ARMY
TO GET THERE,

29:11.750 --> 29:13.273
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'LL
BE IN THE ROVER

29:13.316 --> 29:15.928
AND I CAN GET THERE...

29:17.016 --> 29:19.975
WE FOUND EACH OTHER
IN A CAGE.

29:20.019 --> 29:25.894
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
I KNOW WE'LL FIND
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

29:25.938 --> 29:28.679
YEAH.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.942
WHAT'S WRONG?

30:13.986 --> 30:15.030
WE CAN'T STAY HERE.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.466
NO. NO, CLARKE.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.947
MADI, PLEASE DON'T
QUESTION ME RIGHT NOW.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.470
YOU SHOULD HAVE NEVER
LEFT THAT VALLEY.

30:20.514 --> 30:23.343
I DID THAT BECAUSE
YOU WERE IN TROUBLE.

30:28.348 --> 30:29.871
LISTEN TO ME.

30:29.915 --> 30:32.004
NIYLAH KNOWS THE TRUTH
ABOUT YOU.

30:32.047 --> 30:34.180
AND WHEN OCTAVIA
FINDS OUT--

30:34.223 --> 30:35.355
OCTAVIA'S YOUR FRIEND.

30:35.398 --> 30:37.357
SHE USED TO BE,

30:37.400 --> 30:39.098
BUT 6 YEARS IS
A LONG TIME.

30:39.141 --> 30:43.319
OCTAVIA IS NOT THE GIRL
FROM THE STORIES I TOLD YOU.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.278
NOT ANYMORE.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.888
YOU THINK SHE'LL
HURT ME?

30:46.932 --> 30:48.107
I DON'T KNOW,

30:48.150 --> 30:50.587
BUT I DO KNOW THAT
I CAN'T RISK

30:50.631 --> 30:53.286
ANYTHING BAD
HAPPENING TO YOU.

30:53.329 --> 30:56.898
YOU'RE MY FAMILY,

30:56.942 --> 30:59.379
AND FAMILY LOOKS OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

30:59.422 --> 31:00.859
WHERE WILL WE GO?

31:00.902 --> 31:05.080
HOME, WHEN THE TRANSPORT
SHIP GETS BACK.

31:05.124 --> 31:07.343
NO ONE CARES ABOUT
YOUR BLOOD THERE.

31:07.387 --> 31:08.779
YOU'LL BE SAFE THERE.

31:08.823 --> 31:10.564
YOU WON'T. CLARKE,
IF WE GO BACK,

31:10.607 --> 31:12.218
DIYOZA WILL KILL YOU.

31:12.261 --> 31:14.698
I KNOW IT SUCKS,

31:14.742 --> 31:17.397
BUT SOMETIMES THERE
ARE NO GOOD CHOICES.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.400
NOW, IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO ME,

31:20.443 --> 31:24.186
YOU NEED TO FIND MY MOM.

31:24.230 --> 31:26.188
YOU FIND ABBY, OK?

31:26.232 --> 31:29.061
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

31:30.584 --> 31:32.760
COME HERE.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.118
THOUGHT YOU SAID
HE WAS HERE.

31:43.162 --> 31:44.728
HE WAS,

31:44.772 --> 31:46.905
AT LEAST 20 MINUTES AGO,

31:46.948 --> 31:48.819
THEN THE SIGNAL
WENT DARK AGAIN.

31:48.863 --> 31:51.910
I'M GUESSING HE'S
CAVE HOPPING.

31:51.953 --> 31:55.435
AT LEAST THAT'S
WHAT I WOULD DO.

31:55.478 --> 31:57.785
OVER HERE.

32:03.791 --> 32:06.663
LET'S FINISH THIS.

32:12.234 --> 32:15.063
MCCREARY: STAY SHARP.
HE'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

32:17.805 --> 32:20.460
UP AHEAD, 50 FEET.

32:20.503 --> 32:23.680
SPREAD OUT.

32:25.813 --> 32:28.207
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN
HERE, MURPHY.

32:28.250 --> 32:31.166
YOU HAVE 5 SECONDS
TO COME OUT.

32:33.255 --> 32:39.696
3, 2, 1.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.571
HEH HEH.

32:46.442 --> 32:48.531
ALL RIGHT.

33:02.110 --> 33:05.157
THIS DOESN'T MEAN
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.168
MCCREARY: MURPHY!

33:17.473 --> 33:18.518
MURPHY:
THAT'S MCCREARY.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.913
I GOT IT.

33:34.534 --> 33:37.145
WE HAVE A HOSTAGE.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.985
MAN: IT'S COMING!

33:52.291 --> 33:54.858
MAN: COME ON, WE'VE GOT
TO GET TO THE TRANSPORT.

33:54.902 --> 33:56.643
MAN 2: WE'VE GOT
TO GO NOW.

33:56.686 --> 34:01.430
CLARKE: HEY, COME ON.
IT'S TIME.

34:07.610 --> 34:10.178
MAN: HURRY, HURRY.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.151
MADI, WAIT HERE.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.245
ECHO'S DEFECTING?

34:33.288 --> 34:34.463
UH, NOT EXACTLY.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.204
COME ON, I'LL EXPLAIN
IN THE BUNKER.

34:36.248 --> 34:38.119
BELLAMY.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.903
WE'RE LEAVING, TOO.

34:39.947 --> 34:41.340
WHAT?

34:41.383 --> 34:43.603
IT'S NOT SAFE
FOR US HERE.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.779
NO. CLARKE, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

34:45.822 --> 34:48.129
ECHO'S DEFECTING SO WE
CAN TAKE DOWN THE EYE,
AND ONCE IT'S DOWN--

34:48.173 --> 34:49.609
NO, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

34:49.652 --> 34:52.133
DIYOZA IS THE LEAST
OF MY CONCERNS.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.353
YOUR SISTER IS
DANGEROUS,

34:54.396 --> 34:57.182
AND MADI'S...

34:59.271 --> 35:01.229
MADI. MADI?

35:01.273 --> 35:03.753
MADI!

35:11.979 --> 35:13.459
SHE'S GONE.

35:13.502 --> 35:16.505
WE HAVE TO FIND HER. NOW.

35:18.203 --> 35:19.769
MADI?

35:31.216 --> 35:34.306
ECHO: GOOD,
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

35:34.349 --> 35:36.351
THE OTHERS ARE
ALREADY LEAVING.

35:36.395 --> 35:38.527
STAY WITH ME.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.355
WE'LL BE OK.

35:49.364 --> 35:53.368
MAN: NOW. LET'S GO.
MOVE. COME ON.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.371
MADI!

35:56.415 --> 35:58.721
MADI, WHERE ARE YOU?

36:04.336 --> 36:06.425
WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.297
MAN: IT'S HERE. COME ON.

36:09.341 --> 36:12.953
SEE? IT'S RIGHT THERE.
COME ON. MOVE.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.304
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.786
AAH!

36:21.091 --> 36:22.571
MAN: RUN! RUN!

36:22.615 --> 36:24.182
ECHO: COME ON!

36:25.748 --> 36:28.055
CLARKE:
THEY'RE SHOOTING
AT THE DEFECTORS.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.453
AHH!

36:37.325 --> 36:38.239
KEEP MOVING!

36:42.374 --> 36:44.898
CLARKE: THERE.

36:44.941 --> 36:46.856
ON ME.

36:52.384 --> 36:55.430
BELLAMY: COOPER.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.348
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

37:00.392 --> 37:02.263
OCTAVIA SAID
TO LET THEM GO.

37:02.307 --> 37:05.223
WHO DO YOU THINK
GAVE ME THE ORDER?

37:19.324 --> 37:21.369
ENTER.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.806
IS IT DONE?

37:23.850 --> 37:25.765
MADI: BLODREINA.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.379
MADI.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.381
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

37:33.425 --> 37:36.341
I NEED TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

37:54.489 --> 37:57.623
CLARKE: MADI?

37:59.059 --> 38:00.234
MADI!

38:00.278 --> 38:02.323
OCTAVIA, GET AWAY
FROM HER.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.630
CLARKE, IT'S OK.

38:04.673 --> 38:07.285
I CAME TO HER.

38:10.592 --> 38:12.638
OCTAVIA:
LET HER PASS.

38:25.694 --> 38:27.827
CLARKE: WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

38:29.350 --> 38:32.484
IT'S OK.
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

38:33.746 --> 38:35.748
I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU LIED, CLARKE.

38:35.791 --> 38:37.793
YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT HER.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.666
BUT MADI NO LONGER
NEEDS YOUR PROTECTION.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.581
SHE HAS MINE.

38:42.624 --> 38:45.888
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE THE GIRL UNDER
THE FLOOR.

38:45.932 --> 38:49.544
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE AFRAID ANYMORE.

38:51.285 --> 38:55.202
YOUR TRAINING
BEGINS TOMORROW.

38:55.245 --> 39:00.207
DON'T WORRY, YOUR
SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.564
CLARKE: LET ME SEE
THAT HAND.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.392
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD,
BUT I TOLD HER

39:11.436 --> 39:13.089
I DON'T WANT TO BE
COMMANDER.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.614
I DID IT TO KEEP
YOU SAFE.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.964
THAT'S MY JOB.

39:18.007 --> 39:22.925
AND YOU JUST MADE IT
A WHOLE LOT HARDER.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.843
WE HAD A DEAL.

39:27.887 --> 39:30.106
YOU SAID YOU WOULD
LET THEM GO.

39:30.150 --> 39:33.719
I SAID I'D LET
ECHO GO, AND I DID.

39:33.762 --> 39:35.721
YOU MURDERED
YOUR OWN PEOPLE.

39:35.764 --> 39:37.940
I EXECUTED TRAITORS,

39:37.984 --> 39:41.422
AND I MADE IT LOOK LIKE
A REAL DEFECTION.

39:41.466 --> 39:45.992
DO YOU REALLY THINK
DIYOZA WOULD BELIEVE
ECHO'S STORY

39:46.035 --> 39:48.386
IF I JUST LET THEM GO?

39:50.388 --> 39:54.087
LET ME KNOW WHEN
THE EYE IS DOWN.

39:59.919 --> 40:01.877
ALL RIGHT, MOVE IT.

40:01.921 --> 40:05.577
ALL THE WAY DOWN
TO THE END.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.621
UP AGAINST THAT WALL.

40:06.665 --> 40:07.883
KARINA: TARIK.

40:07.927 --> 40:09.668
STAY WITH ME,
KARINA.

40:09.711 --> 40:13.280
NOT TARIK.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.545
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

40:17.589 --> 40:20.200
LET'S SEE WHAT
YOU GOT.

40:20.243 --> 40:22.463
STAY WITH ME.

40:22.507 --> 40:24.160
HEY, I LIKE THIS.

40:24.204 --> 40:25.248
STAY WITH ME.

40:25.292 --> 40:28.600
YOU GOT ANY WEAPONS?

40:28.643 --> 40:30.602
ANYTHING SHINY?

40:30.645 --> 40:34.214
NOTHING.
SHE NEEDS A DOCTOR.

40:34.257 --> 40:38.392
QUIET. EYES FRONT.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.612
UHH!

40:40.655 --> 40:43.353
THIS IS NICE.

40:45.530 --> 40:46.922
I'M GONNA KEEP THAT.

40:46.966 --> 40:51.187
DIYOZA:
PARKER, THAT'S ENOUGH.

40:51.231 --> 40:52.624
SHE'S BEEN SHOT.

40:52.667 --> 40:56.932
LET ME SEE.
PUT PRESSURE ON IT.

40:56.976 --> 41:00.196
ABBY WILL TREAT IT ONCE
WE GET TO THE GROUND.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.634
WE APPRECIATE THE RISK
YOU'VE ALL TAKEN,

41:02.677 --> 41:05.854
BUT UNTIL WE GET TO
KNOW YOU BETTER...

41:16.648 --> 41:17.649
WHAT IS THIS?

41:17.692 --> 41:19.389
JUST A PRECAUTION.

41:19.433 --> 41:20.782
DO I GET ONE, TOO?

41:20.826 --> 41:22.523
STOP WORRYING, KANE.

41:22.567 --> 41:23.959
I TAKE CARE
OF MY FRIENDS.

41:24.003 --> 41:27.223
NOW COME ON,
LET'S GO HOME.

41:38.147 --> 41:42.369
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
