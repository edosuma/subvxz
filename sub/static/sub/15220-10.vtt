'Theorising that one could time
travel within his own lifetime,

00:28.895 --> 00:32.189
Dr Sam Beckett stepped into the
Quantum Leap accelerator

00:32.189 --> 00:34.234
and vanished.

00:39.197 --> 00:41.574
He woke to find himself trapped in
the past,

00:41.574 --> 00:44.828
facing mirror images that were not
his own

00:44.828 --> 00:49.499
and driven by an unknown force to
change history for the better.

00:50.542 --> 00:52.669
His only guide on this journey is Al,

00:52.669 --> 00:54.838
an observer from his own time

00:54.838 --> 00:59.592
who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear

00:59.592 --> 01:03.972
And so Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:03.972 --> 01:07.017
striving to put right what once went
wrong

01:07.017 --> 01:12.063
and hoping each time that his next
leap will be the leap home.'

01:20.363 --> 01:22.699
Pearson, you forgot the talc.

01:22.699 --> 01:24.826
Er, yes.

01:24.826 --> 01:26.995
Yes, well, talc.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.003
Use it.

01:38.340 --> 01:40.383
All right, that's enough.

01:41.843 --> 01:43.887
Really, Pearson.

03:26.239 --> 03:28.450
I'm the servant of a higher power.

03:28.450 --> 03:31.870
But now I found myself a servant of a
much different kind.'

03:31.870 --> 03:34.873
I want you to turn over my wardrobe,
weed out all the old suits.

03:34.873 --> 03:37.959
Anything in particular, sir?
Use your judgement.

03:37.959 --> 03:39.794
Good morning, sir!
Calloway.

03:39.794 --> 03:41.796
It's a beautiful tree, sir.

03:41.796 --> 03:43.923
Get rid of it. I want a bigger one.

03:43.923 --> 03:46.051
My thoughts precisely, sir.

03:47.552 --> 03:50.680
You heard Mr Blake. Get a bigger
tree. Right!

03:54.017 --> 03:56.102
(CLOCK CHIMES)

04:01.191 --> 04:03.902
Mmm! (LAUGHS) Sir.

04:09.366 --> 04:11.534
Where is it?
Sir?

04:11.534 --> 04:14.120
Where the hell is my newspaper?

04:15.580 --> 04:17.999
Where the hell is Mr Blake's paper?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.587
Well, let me see.

04:22.587 --> 04:27.217
Er, where...where would I have put
that darn newspaper?

04:27.217 --> 04:28.677
Um...

04:28.677 --> 04:32.597
Why not try the foyer
where it always is?

04:32.597 --> 04:35.350
The foyer. Yes, sir.

04:44.484 --> 04:46.528
Ha-ha, the foyer.

04:50.699 --> 04:53.535
Er, guys, you got the thing...

05:12.679 --> 05:14.848
The day before Christmas.

05:14.848 --> 05:19.603
Yeah, and I sure would like to find
one of those under my tree.

05:19.603 --> 05:23.315
I'm a 200-pound valet.
Well, count your blessings.

05:23.315 --> 05:26.443
You could be wearing a red suit and
ringing a bell in front of Macy's.

05:27.485 --> 05:31.114
And you could be a waiter at Trader
Vic's.

05:32.157 --> 05:35.577
Hey, it's not Christmas where I am.
I mean, when I am.

05:35.577 --> 05:38.622
It's the middle of July.
OK.

05:38.622 --> 05:40.790
Pearson!

05:40.790 --> 05:43.585
Who's this guy I'm working for?
Michael Blake.

05:43.585 --> 05:45.879
One of the richest guys in the
country.

05:45.879 --> 05:51.593
He started out buying small mom and
pop companies, automating them, then
selling them for profit.

05:51.593 --> 05:55.764
Now he does it with corporations. He
put more people out of work than the
Great Depression.

05:55.764 --> 05:57.891
And me?
You're Reginald Pearson.

05:57.891 --> 06:01.394
You've been picking up after Blake
for three years. Pearson!

06:01.394 --> 06:04.230
Coming, sir! Why am I here?

06:04.230 --> 06:07.317
Well, um, we're working on...

06:07.317 --> 06:09.569
Oh!
Al, Al!

06:09.569 --> 06:13.156
But Ziggy says this one could be a
little tricky.

06:13.156 --> 06:15.659
Why tricky?
Why tricky? Well...

06:16.785 --> 06:18.828
You may have to bathe him.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.378
Here's your paper, sir.

06:26.378 --> 06:28.421
It's about time.
Sorry, sir.

06:29.506 --> 06:32.384
Well, look at that. Khrushchev at
Disneyland.

06:32.384 --> 06:36.262
Why don't they just invite him to
the Pentagon and let him go through
the files?

06:36.262 --> 06:39.599
I don't care what those doves on
Capitol Hill say, sir.

06:39.599 --> 06:44.896
War is inevitable. I only hope we
have the good sense to strike first.

06:44.896 --> 06:47.023
We will never go to war against
Russia.

06:48.233 --> 06:52.362
In fact, the time is gonna come when
we break down all the barriers

06:52.362 --> 06:55.532
and, well, we work with them as
allies.

06:57.158 --> 07:00.036
Could happen, don't you think?

07:21.766 --> 07:25.103
Hello?
"Hello?"

07:25.103 --> 07:29.816
Calloway, have you noticed anything
strange about Pearson lately?

07:29.816 --> 07:31.985
Definitely, sir. He worries me.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.529
Perhaps we should consider
termination?

07:34.529 --> 07:36.698
Oh, you think we should fire him?

07:36.698 --> 07:40.201
Er, it was just an option, sir.

07:40.201 --> 07:42.662
"..here in the lobby
to see Mr Blake."

07:42.662 --> 07:44.748
OK, thanks.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.752
Sir, that was Bert.

07:48.752 --> 07:50.920
Er, the doorman.

07:50.920 --> 07:55.258
And he said there's a Captain Downey
waiting for you in the lobby, sir.

07:55.258 --> 07:57.260
Captain Downey?
Mm-hm.

07:57.260 --> 08:01.222
It's those Salvation Army people
I was telling you about, sir.

08:02.265 --> 08:05.226
Well, get rid of them.
I'm sorry, sir?

08:06.645 --> 08:08.772
Get rid of them, Pearson.

08:08.772 --> 08:11.566
Er...how?

08:11.566 --> 08:13.652
I really don't care how.

08:14.694 --> 08:18.615
Tell them I'm not at home.
Tell them I'm out of the country.

08:18.615 --> 08:20.951
Better yet, just tell them to go
invade a country.

08:20.951 --> 08:23.119
I don't care. Just get rid of them.

08:23.119 --> 08:26.748
Sir, don't you think
that it would be...?

08:26.748 --> 08:28.333
Yes, sir.

08:31.294 --> 08:33.129

08:33.129 --> 08:34.881
Yes, sir.

08:38.510 --> 08:41.929
(BRASS BAND PLAYS)
Excuse me, Captain Downey?

08:43.474 --> 08:46.018
We're here to see Mr Blake.
Well, I'm sorry,

08:46.018 --> 08:48.187
but Mr Blake is unavailable
right now.

08:48.187 --> 08:50.648
I bet he'd change his mind
if he saw her.

08:50.648 --> 08:55.110
Mr Blake is never available.
Mr Blake hasn't been available for
the last 18 months.

08:55.110 --> 08:59.532
He returns all my mail and I am not
gonna let him tear down the Fourth
Street Mission.

08:59.532 --> 09:01.742
And I'm here to tell him that to his
face.

09:01.742 --> 09:06.205
Well, I'm sure that Mr Blake has no
intention of demolishing the
mission.

09:06.205 --> 09:08.249
Oh, yes, I do!

09:08.249 --> 09:11.418
Mr Blake, this is Captain Downey
from the Salvation Army.

09:11.418 --> 09:14.547
Yes, I can hear that, Pearson. Quiet!

09:14.547 --> 09:18.425
(MUSIC STOPS)
Now, listen, Colonel Downey.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.761
Pearson, like most of the people in
the world,

09:20.761 --> 09:23.055
has no idea what he's talking about.

09:23.055 --> 09:25.224
First of all, I am Captain Downey.

09:25.224 --> 09:27.268
You're...Downey?

09:28.477 --> 09:32.314
And second, Pearson is right
when he says you shouldn't tear down
the mission.

09:32.314 --> 09:36.986
Well, yes, sir, I'm sure they perform
a valuable service.

09:36.986 --> 09:40.364
The Fourth Street Mission has served
Lower Manhattan for 47 years.

09:40.364 --> 09:42.533
We help 165 people every week

09:42.533 --> 09:46.203
with food and temporary shelter,
counselling and spiritual guidance,

09:46.203 --> 09:48.080
which you can read about in my
report.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.416
Your report, Captain, is irrelevant.

09:50.416 --> 09:53.711
My attorneys have been in touch with
your organisation for over a year,

09:53.711 --> 09:56.463
giving you ample time to move.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.425
There's nowhere to go.
That's not my fault.

09:59.425 --> 10:03.846
Sir, maybe she could move into one
of your properties... Shut up.

10:03.846 --> 10:05.973
Shut up, Calloway.
Yes, sir.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.392
Why can't you give us more time?

10:08.392 --> 10:10.853
If your building isn't down by
December 31st,

10:10.853 --> 10:12.813
I lose my permit to build.

10:12.813 --> 10:17.276
I'm not gonna let that happen. I have
big plans for that property.

10:17.276 --> 10:20.154
Blake Plaza.
Yes, and once it's completed,

10:20.154 --> 10:24.909
I'll have the most contemporary
theatres, shops, offices and
apartments in New York.

10:24.909 --> 10:27.286
But not for the people at the
mission, sir.

10:27.286 --> 10:30.289
It's not my job to save the world.

10:30.289 --> 10:32.958
God forbid. That'd mean you care
about people.

10:32.958 --> 10:36.504
Sir, maybe you could find a way to
accommodate both your needs.

10:36.504 --> 10:39.590
Pearson, you're way out of line
here. Yes, sir.

10:39.590 --> 10:43.761
I think you should worry about your
job and let me worry about mine.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.889
Which is being a grouch.

10:50.309 --> 10:52.353
What did you say?

10:53.771 --> 10:57.608
Well?
Er, who are you talking to, sir?

10:57.608 --> 11:01.195
I'm talking to this jerk right here!

11:02.404 --> 11:04.490
Well, where did he go?

11:05.449 --> 11:07.660
Who?
Never mind.

11:07.660 --> 11:12.832
Pearson, I want these people
out of here. Call the police
if you have to.

11:13.707 --> 11:18.212
Well, if you'll excuse me, Captain
Downey.

11:24.260 --> 11:27.847
He saw you! How could he have seen
you? He actually saw you!

11:27.847 --> 11:31.851
He didn't listen, though. I hope I
didn't get you in trouble.

11:31.851 --> 11:35.354
Er, no. I'm just sorry I couldn't
help you.

11:35.354 --> 11:38.941
Well, we'll survive. It's all in
God's hands now.

11:38.941 --> 11:41.861
But that doesn't mean I'm not gonna
help.

11:41.861 --> 11:44.530
Lieutenant, as loudly as you can.

11:44.530 --> 11:46.532
And two, three, four...

11:46.532 --> 11:50.452
â™ª Bringing in the sheaves, bringing
in the sheaves

11:50.452 --> 11:54.206
â™ª We will go rejoicing, bringing in
the sheaves

11:54.206 --> 11:57.877
â™ª Bringing in the sheaves, bringing
in the sheaves... â™ª

11:57.877 --> 12:01.755
How could Blake see you?
Ziggy says it was a weird fluke.

12:01.755 --> 12:05.301
What kind of a fluke? Well,
apparently, his neurons and mesons

12:05.301 --> 12:07.386
are on a frequency close to yours.

12:07.386 --> 12:09.889
So I'm gonna get Ziggy to shift my
image a little bit

12:09.889 --> 12:12.391
and then only you will be able to
receive me.

12:12.391 --> 12:14.518
It's kind of like tuning a radio.

12:14.518 --> 12:15.936
There.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.230
Now, that should clear things up.

12:20.441 --> 12:23.527
Except for why I'm here.
That should be obvious.

12:23.527 --> 12:27.323
Well, to save the mission, I guess.
No, no, to save Blake.

12:27.323 --> 12:30.743
Blake? What does a man like Blake
need to have saved?

12:30.743 --> 12:32.578
His soul.

12:32.578 --> 12:35.206
BLAKE: I'm tired of sitting here
waiting around.

12:35.206 --> 12:39.084
These people, if they can't do it,
tell them to get lost. Yes, sir.

12:39.084 --> 12:41.629
Get rid of 'em.
Yes, sir.

12:45.412 --> 12:50.750
Al, how am I supposed to save Blake's
soul - if he even has one?

12:50.750 --> 12:55.213
You saw how he treated those people.
Out. Polyester. Keep this one.

12:55.213 --> 12:57.424
We don't know very much about the
guy.

12:57.424 --> 13:01.219
Every time we try and get background
information, Ziggy comes up empty.

13:01.219 --> 13:05.307
You know what they say? If you wanna
find out something about someone...

13:06.474 --> 13:08.977
..you check their closet.
Yeah.

13:08.977 --> 13:13.690
Oh, yeah, sure. Go to the closet,
you're gonna pull out a big box of
information.

13:13.690 --> 13:16.276
Whooo, whoooo...

13:17.652 --> 13:20.906
What have you got, Havanas?
No, not Havanas, pictures.

13:20.906 --> 13:23.533
Old pictures. Look at that.

13:27.787 --> 13:29.789
Al, he changed his name.

13:29.789 --> 13:32.626
No wonder we couldn't find any
information on him.

13:32.626 --> 13:34.669
Carol Of The Bells.

13:36.254 --> 13:39.591
Looks like he started out in a
slightly different neighbourhood.

13:39.591 --> 13:44.804
Yeah. All right, have Ziggy figure
out where these pictures were taken.

13:44.804 --> 13:47.682
Then get all the information you can
on Michael Blakowski.

13:47.682 --> 13:52.771
Can you believe it's Christmas
and he has no second thoughts about
throwing those people on the streets?

13:52.771 --> 13:56.066
Well, he's a real Scrooge.
Yeah, you can say that again.

13:56.066 --> 14:00.278
Scrooge.
Al...Al, you're a genius.

14:01.863 --> 14:04.241
I am?
Yes, you are. Absolutely.

14:04.241 --> 14:07.536
Michael is Scrooge, right?

14:07.536 --> 14:12.499
He's alone, he's miserable. It's like
Charles... Dickens.

14:12.499 --> 14:15.627
It's like Dickens created his
character based on this guy.

14:15.627 --> 14:18.713
So?
So we Scrooge him.

14:18.713 --> 14:21.466
Oh, OK. How do we do that?

14:21.466 --> 14:23.635
We take him back to his beginnings.

14:23.635 --> 14:26.930
We try and remind him there's more
important things in life.

14:30.350 --> 14:32.394
Where are you going?
To get some help.

14:32.394 --> 14:36.064
What do you think I'm doing here?
That's not what I'm talking about.

14:37.232 --> 14:40.443
Er, Bibi.
Mm-hm.

14:40.443 --> 14:41.653
Thanks...

14:48.201 --> 14:50.203
Never mind.

14:50.203 --> 14:53.790
â™ª Deck the halls with me and Bibi â™ª

14:59.212 --> 15:01.172
Captain Downey.
Mr Pearson!

15:06.803 --> 15:09.681
You're doing a wonderful job here.
Thank you.

15:09.681 --> 15:14.352
Listen, I wanted to apologise about
what happened at the apartment.

15:19.274 --> 15:24.362
Listen, I think I may be able to stop
Blake from tearing down the mission.

15:26.656 --> 15:28.700
But I'm gonna need your help.

15:29.701 --> 15:31.870
When do we start?

15:31.870 --> 15:34.080
Have Pearson call me at the club.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.583
I can't believe he left and didn't
say anything.

15:36.583 --> 15:39.127
Nothing Pearson does
surprises me any more.

15:39.127 --> 15:42.088
Good luck on the Henderson deal,
sir.

15:42.088 --> 15:44.090
Luck had nothing to do with it.

15:44.090 --> 15:47.761
I had the guts and the fortitude to
automate Henderson's bakery.

15:47.761 --> 15:50.388
That's why United Federal wants to
buy it, not luck.

15:50.388 --> 15:52.515
Quite right, sir.

15:52.515 --> 15:54.392
Quite right.

15:58.438 --> 16:01.483
George, what the hell are these suits
doing back here?

16:02.984 --> 16:05.862
Pearson, what the hell are you doing
here? Where's George?

16:05.862 --> 16:09.866
Well, sir, he had a little emergency
come up at home.

16:09.866 --> 16:12.452
I was carrying out your suits

16:12.452 --> 16:14.913
and he asked me if I could just
cover for him.

16:16.289 --> 16:19.209
Where the hell did these pictures
come from? Pictures, sir?

16:20.418 --> 16:24.089
Ha, ha, yeah, those. You know, I was
cleaning out your closet.

16:24.089 --> 16:27.717
And I came across those. They just
fell in with the suits.

16:27.717 --> 16:31.388
When I was picking everything up, I
couldn't help but notice...

16:31.388 --> 16:33.056
the woman.

16:33.056 --> 16:35.892
Is she a relative?
She was my mother.

16:37.936 --> 16:40.897
She passed away shortly after this
picture was taken.

16:41.856 --> 16:43.900
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

16:46.278 --> 16:48.321
She was a very beautiful woman.

16:49.489 --> 16:52.951
Your father was a lucky guy.
My father was a bum!

16:52.951 --> 16:57.038
He left us when I was three.
My mother had to scrub floors just so
we could eat.

16:57.038 --> 17:01.334
That poor woman died on her hands and
knees, cleaning someone else's
bathroom.

17:03.420 --> 17:04.880
Well, I...

17:24.983 --> 17:26.984
Now?
Go ahead.

17:32.616 --> 17:35.785
Why have we stopped?
I think we've got a flat tyre.

17:35.785 --> 17:38.830
Don't be ridiculous. We would have
felt it.

17:38.830 --> 17:41.416
(HISS OF AIR)
I don't know. I think we do.

17:46.004 --> 17:48.173
Er, yeah, look at that.

17:48.173 --> 17:51.218
Oh, this is great. I'll never make
that meeting now.

17:52.761 --> 17:56.014
Pearson! This is skid row, for crying
out loud!

17:56.014 --> 17:59.559
We've got no business driving here.
No wonder we have a flat. Sorry, sir.

17:59.559 --> 18:03.980

thing changed as fast as we can...

Mr Blake?

18:45.522 --> 18:48.858
Are you OK? You look like you've
just seen a ghost.

18:50.151 --> 18:51.736
Um...

18:51.736 --> 18:54.781
No, I just thought... Do you know
those boys?

18:54.781 --> 18:56.908
What boys?

18:56.908 --> 18:58.994
The ones that were...

19:00.078 --> 19:03.206
Never mind. What brings you to this
part of town?

19:03.206 --> 19:05.750
Well, we had a flat tyre.

19:05.750 --> 19:10.213
How unfortunate. There's a pay phone
around the corner. It's inside.

19:10.213 --> 19:13.967
That's Stigler's coffee shop.
Yes. How did you know that?

19:13.967 --> 19:16.094
I grew up on this street.

19:16.094 --> 19:18.221
See that building right over there?

19:18.221 --> 19:20.807
Charlie O'Riley used to live there.

19:20.807 --> 19:24.311
Charlie and I used to do everything
together when we were kids.

19:24.311 --> 19:27.731
It's hard to imagine you as a kid,
er, sir.

19:27.731 --> 19:32.652
We used to play stick ball for hours,
every day, just like these kids.

19:33.904 --> 19:36.156
Does he still live there?
I don't know.

There's one for you here. That's

just in the neighbourhood, Max.

This is Miss Downey.

How do you do?

Mr Pearson, nice to meet you.

You guys are old buddies, huh?

20:36.216 --> 20:39.427
Are you kidding? Since we were kids!

20:39.427 --> 20:42.722
Hey, Max, you remember old Charlie
O'Riley?

20:42.722 --> 20:45.934
How could I forget him? You were
like Siamese twins.

20:45.934 --> 20:50.313
Remember the time we dropped them
water bags out the window on ol'
lady Malone?

20:50.313 --> 20:52.357
Whooooa!
That's right.

20:52.357 --> 20:55.318
She chased us, and we were laughing
so hard, we fell down.

20:55.318 --> 20:59.406
Charlie snuck back to her house and
locked her out. He did!

20:59.406 --> 21:02.701
He locked her out of her own house.
Do you ever hear from him?

21:04.911 --> 21:06.955
You mean you don't know?

21:10.917 --> 21:13.044
What, Max? Know what?

21:13.044 --> 21:15.171
Charlie was killed.

21:15.171 --> 21:18.258
Yeah, about four years ago.

21:18.258 --> 21:21.094
How?
He got drunk.

21:21.094 --> 21:24.347
Damn fool jumped out
in front of a bus.

21:24.347 --> 21:26.141
Yeah.

21:26.141 --> 21:30.562
He'd been in pretty bad shape since
he lost his job at Henderson's.

21:30.562 --> 21:34.190
The bakery? Yeah, he got laid off
when they automated.

21:34.190 --> 21:36.735
Couldn't find another job. Went on
the skids.

21:36.735 --> 21:38.653
What a shame.

21:39.696 --> 21:41.740
He had five kids.

21:43.617 --> 21:46.119
Here, Max.
Get outta here!

21:46.119 --> 21:48.580
Get outta here! Put it away! It's on
the house.

21:48.580 --> 21:50.665
Just keep it, will you, Max?

21:52.626 --> 21:53.793
What?

21:56.171 --> 21:58.298
I do something wrong?

21:58.298 --> 22:00.342
No, I did.

the window.

his old neighbourhood.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.171
I don't understand you.

23:38.171 --> 23:40.506
It's obvious that it's working.

23:42.091 --> 23:44.552
It is?
Sure.

23:44.552 --> 23:47.972
That little walk down Memory Lane
jogged something in him

23:47.972 --> 23:50.058
and he's sitting there thinking
about it.

23:50.058 --> 23:52.185
You've gotta keep pushing now.

23:52.185 --> 23:53.644
How?

23:54.645 --> 23:58.149
Well, you took him to the past. Now
you've gotta show him his present.

that this is the right thing to do.

Are you OK?

24:10.661 --> 24:12.038
Yeah.

Yeah, I'm just thinking about my
Christmas in '62.

in the snow. It was great.

don't.

30:08.770 --> 30:12.648
(APPLAUSE)
That was wonderful.

30:15.109 --> 30:18.071
Now, tonight, we have a very special
treat.

30:18.071 --> 30:20.615
Piernik and makowiec.
Ah!

30:20.615 --> 30:22.784
WOMAN: It's better than it sounds.

30:24.118 --> 30:26.079
What's that?

30:26.079 --> 30:30.708
It's Polish. Honey nut cake and poppy
seed jelly roll cake.

30:30.708 --> 30:32.752
It's a tradition.

30:34.128 --> 30:36.172
More piernik, Mr Blake?

30:37.382 --> 30:39.550
Oh, no, I really couldn't.

30:39.550 --> 30:42.887
You don't like it?
No. I mean, yes, I do!

30:42.887 --> 30:44.639
It's delicious.

30:44.639 --> 30:47.684
My mother used to make this for me
every Christmas.

30:47.684 --> 30:50.728
Well, I can't think of a nicer
compliment.

30:50.728 --> 30:52.897
You made this?

30:52.897 --> 30:55.650
She sings and she cooks.
It's amazing.

30:55.650 --> 31:00.405
No, no, it's just... It's just that
there's so much I don't know
about you.

31:01.989 --> 31:04.117
And I'd like that to change.

31:08.496 --> 31:12.583
Now, would you just look at this?
This is better than anything we
could have dreamed of.

31:12.583 --> 31:14.877
You've saved a man and the mission.

31:14.877 --> 31:17.046
Looks like it, doesn't it?

31:17.046 --> 31:19.632
What do you mean? You did it, Sam.

31:19.632 --> 31:22.885
All we have to do now is sit back
and let nature take its course.

31:24.554 --> 31:26.848
Hey, hey, look at this.

31:27.598 --> 31:29.976
Well, what have you got there?

31:29.976 --> 31:32.103
This is for you.

31:32.103 --> 31:34.272
For me?

31:34.272 --> 31:36.274
His name is Sheldon.

31:37.859 --> 31:39.652
Come here.

31:41.612 --> 31:44.115
I'd put my money on a horse named
Sheldon any day.

31:44.115 --> 31:48.661
Ziggy says there's a 97% chance

31:48.661 --> 31:50.747
that you've turned Blake...

31:52.665 --> 31:55.126
Uh-oh, 95?
What?

31:55.126 --> 31:56.669
93?

31:56.669 --> 31:59.922
The odds are going down.
I don't know why. Me first!

32:03.509 --> 32:05.553
I think I do.

32:06.471 --> 32:08.181
Thanks.

32:08.181 --> 32:11.225
I made him cos Santa Claus can't come
visit us this year.

32:11.225 --> 32:14.645
We don't have a home to live in.
Do you have a home?

32:22.236 --> 32:24.405
I underestimated you, Captain.

32:24.405 --> 32:27.241
Pretty clever, using the kids.
Excuse me?

32:27.241 --> 32:31.913
Don't play dumb! You were trying to
make a mark out of me and I was
actually falling for it.

32:31.913 --> 32:33.998
But it isn't going to work.

32:35.124 --> 32:37.794
You hear that, Pearson? It's not
going to work.

32:38.503 --> 32:40.713
This building comes down in one
week!

32:40.713 --> 32:43.758
It's gonna take a lot more than
piernik and makowiec

32:43.758 --> 32:46.010
and some three-legged horse
to stop it!

32:47.261 --> 32:48.471
Pearson!

33:08.515 --> 33:11.268
I won't be needing you any more
tonight.

33:11.268 --> 33:14.605
Sir, if you just give me...
Good night, Pearson.

33:14.605 --> 33:16.273
Mr Blake...

33:17.399 --> 33:19.526
..I was not trying to trick you.

33:19.526 --> 33:22.070
What were you trying to do?

33:22.070 --> 33:24.615
Well, sir...

33:24.615 --> 33:28.452
I was trying... ..to change me
into somebody that I'm not.

33:29.787 --> 33:31.997
Now I'm going to bed.

33:31.997 --> 33:35.834
And you'd better hope that I still
don't wanna fire you when I get up
in the morning.

33:35.834 --> 33:39.505
And get rid of that damn tree!

33:43.801 --> 33:45.302
Yes, sir.

33:50.766 --> 33:52.810
What's with Ebenezer there?

33:54.520 --> 33:57.731
He's ready to tear down the mission
with his bare hands.

33:57.731 --> 33:59.691
I think I'm making things worse.

33:59.691 --> 34:02.820
Well, you gotta save the man's soul
or you can't leap out of here.

34:02.820 --> 34:05.114
Think about the people down at the
mission.

34:05.114 --> 34:07.282
He's never gonna believe me again.

34:07.282 --> 34:09.743
I'll be lucky if I have a job in the
morning.

34:09.743 --> 34:12.871
It would take a miracle to convince
him that he's wrong.

34:15.916 --> 34:19.168
You know something, I don't like
that look on your face.

34:21.295 --> 34:22.714
Uh-uh.

34:23.799 --> 34:26.635
We're Scrooging Blake, right.
Right.

34:26.635 --> 34:30.389
Right. And I think we should just
keep at it.

34:30.389 --> 34:35.601
Keep at it? And give him
the Ghost of Christmas Future.

Oooh-oooh...

35:11.513 --> 35:15.559
Wait a minute. I know who you are.
You're that jerk from the lobby.

I recognise the bad clothes and the
pale complexion.

35:18.604 --> 35:20.189

35:20.189 --> 35:24.568

Pearson put you up to this, didn't
he? It's good make-up.

35:39.750 --> 35:45.672
Are you hard of hearing? I'm here to
show you your future. Ooooh!

35:45.672 --> 35:48.842
Well, maybe I should just show you
your future!

35:52.387 --> 35:54.765
You're pretty quick.
I didn't see you move.

35:54.765 --> 35:57.935

36:25.421 --> 36:27.548

36:32.052 --> 36:35.264
What, sir?
You don't see it?

36:35.264 --> 36:39.268
It's standing right there,
smoking a cigar, staring at me!

36:39.268 --> 36:42.479
It's horrible. It needs a tan.

see here is you.

doctor.

can't see or hear it.

Yes, he distinctly said this side
of the Blake plaza.

Well, sir, do you see him anywhere?

been working pretty hard lately.

dreams can...

Stay with me.

38:13.737 --> 38:15.906
I'm right here, sir.

38:15.906 --> 38:19.952
Maybe we should find out why he
brought you down here. Ask him.

38:19.952 --> 38:22.246
That's a good idea.
Why did you bring me?

38:22.246 --> 38:24.581

else happens to me.

unable to meet mortgage commitments.

That's a sign, isn't it?

43:50.949 --> 43:52.785
I think so, sir, yes.

43:52.785 --> 43:59.291
â™ª Round yon Virgin

43:59.291 --> 44:04.254
â™ª Mother and child

44:05.672 --> 44:10.636
â™ª Holy infant

44:10.636 --> 44:14.723
â™ª So tender and mild â™ª

44:14.723 --> 44:16.850
Go on, sir.

44:16.850 --> 44:24.525
â™ª Sleep in heavenly peace

44:29.238 --> 44:36.161
â™ª Sleep in heavenly peace â™ª

44:37.538 --> 44:39.665
Mr Blake!

44:39.665 --> 44:41.708
What a nice surprise.

44:44.336 --> 44:46.839
Do you have room
for one more lost soul?

44:48.424 --> 44:50.467
Of course.

44:52.177 --> 44:54.346
What happens to him, Al?

44:54.346 --> 44:57.641
Well, in six months, he marries
Downey.

44:57.641 --> 44:59.810
And they have three kids.

44:59.810 --> 45:01.937
That's great.
Yeah, that's great.

45:01.937 --> 45:04.273
So I guess
he never builds the plaza, huh?

45:05.232 --> 45:07.401
No, he does build it.

45:07.401 --> 45:09.778
And he puts the mission on the first
floor.

45:12.865 --> 45:14.032
Hmmm.

45:16.243 --> 45:19.788
I wonder if he'd have knocked on
that door if you hadn't put that star
up there.

45:21.331 --> 45:24.334
I didn't put the star up there.

45:36.680 --> 45:38.724
Merry Christmas, Al.

45:40.184 --> 45:42.227
Merry Christmas, Sam.

46:03.624 --> 46:05.667
(SHIP'S HORN)

46:10.839 --> 46:12.883
Philip? Oh, Philip!

46:17.054 --> 46:19.098
Why the hell are you here?

46:21.475 --> 46:23.268
Oh, boy!
