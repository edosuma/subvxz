00:53.556 --> 00:55.363
'Tis the night...

00:55.453 --> 00:59.602
...the night of the grave's delight.

02:01.223 --> 02:02.955
Gotcha.

02:03.675 --> 02:05.550
Get up.

02:05.630 --> 02:09.476
Hey. They're not your mates.
Your mates are over here.

02:09.556 --> 02:11.155
Go on. Go.

02:19.290 --> 02:21.289
You think I give a shit, Corey?

02:42.723 --> 02:45.722
- Ready for the money shot?
- Yeah, man.

03:03.922 --> 03:07.968
The fuck? Are you blind? Faggot!

03:08.423 --> 03:13.222
How many times have I got to
tell you you are not welcome here?

03:13.872 --> 03:16.088
Are you fucking mute as well?

03:20.755 --> 03:22.976
Get the fuck up. Go. Go!

03:23.056 --> 03:25.122
Yeah, run, you little fag!

03:28.256 --> 03:30.343
Fuckin' freak gives me the creeps.

03:33.489 --> 03:35.288
What a dickhead.

04:04.122 --> 04:05.842
- Mr. M.
- Boys.

04:05.922 --> 04:07.788
How you going?

04:08.122 --> 04:09.988
Mr. M.

04:10.988 --> 04:14.776
I've been trying all afternoon
to get this damn printer to work.

04:14.856 --> 04:17.721
Have you tried... plugging it in?

04:21.922 --> 04:25.404
- It's fixed.
- What? What did you do?

04:25.484 --> 04:26.810
Show me what you did.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.809
Mr. M.

04:28.889 --> 04:32.909
No pop-tarts. I guess you
didn't know I was coming over?

04:32.989 --> 04:35.009
So, how was your final day?

04:35.089 --> 04:37.243
Must be a bit sad leaving school behind.

04:37.323 --> 04:40.010
- That's not the word I'd use.
- You home for dinner?

04:40.090 --> 04:42.942
I'm sure you can microwave
your lean cuisine on your own.

04:43.022 --> 04:45.544
Having dinner together
isn't just about eating.

04:45.624 --> 04:48.655
- It's about...
- Spending quality time together.

04:51.490 --> 04:53.909
Wait. What'd...
what'd you want to talk about?

04:53.989 --> 04:56.776
Oh, well... what are you doing tonight?

04:56.856 --> 05:00.476
- Skating. Trick or treating.
- Thought you hated Halloween.

05:00.556 --> 05:04.009
- Shouldn't you be studying?
- Well, exams don't start till next week.

05:04.089 --> 05:07.562
Every grade counts if you're gonna
get a scholarship to New York.

05:12.856 --> 05:16.921
- Have you been in my room again?
- This came in the mail today.

05:20.056 --> 05:22.642
They're on the other side of the world, mate.

05:22.722 --> 05:25.909
I thought you were going
to study here, like your old man.

05:25.989 --> 05:28.055
You might have thought that.

05:28.822 --> 05:31.490
Photography's a fun hobby.

05:31.570 --> 05:35.688
- But it's hardly gonna pay the bills, is it?
- Can we talk about this another time?

05:35.822 --> 05:38.821
Maybe, I don't know, my 18th?

05:45.922 --> 05:47.455
Corey?

05:50.755 --> 05:52.043
Yep?

05:52.123 --> 05:54.642
I thought we might go away for the weekend.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.788
Up to the lake for a bit of fishing.
What do you say?

05:58.289 --> 06:01.842
It just sounds like great fun.
Don't you think?

06:01.922 --> 06:03.788
I think I have to study.

06:20.957 --> 06:23.376
Man, kill me if I ever end up like him.

06:23.456 --> 06:25.255
<i>Amigo,</i> it's a promise.

06:25.689 --> 06:28.183
- Is that a whole bottle of vodka?
- Yeah. Here you are.

06:28.263 --> 06:31.921
- He's gonna notice that's gone.
- So? What's he gonna do?

06:32.222 --> 06:34.772
Bore you to death? The guy's a numbnut.

06:36.490 --> 06:38.955
Off the bed, dickheads. What the hell?

06:42.922 --> 06:45.155
What's the plan for tonight?

06:47.456 --> 06:50.109
A little trick. A little treat.

06:50.189 --> 06:52.456
Then a whole lot of tits at the tower.

06:53.523 --> 06:56.323
So we're finishing high school
the way we spent it.

06:59.889 --> 07:03.875
What's the matter, New York? Too good for it?

07:03.955 --> 07:05.989
What is this shit?

07:07.855 --> 07:09.775
You actually pissed about that?

07:09.855 --> 07:12.642
Well, I thought we were
all going to Box Hill.

07:12.722 --> 07:14.775
The world is bigger than that.

07:14.855 --> 07:17.446
So, what, you're just gonna ditch... us?

07:17.525 --> 07:21.049
Well, come on. It's not like we can hang out
at the tower forever, smoking billies.

07:21.129 --> 07:23.143
What the hell is wrong with that?

07:24.222 --> 07:26.256
Yo, Dave Grohl!

07:26.555 --> 07:28.373
Shut the fuck up.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.403
It was just an idea.

07:38.489 --> 07:40.477
If it means that much to you...

07:40.556 --> 07:42.989
...don't get your panties in a twist.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.856
My panties are fine, fuck knuckle.

07:48.256 --> 07:50.686
I don't like it when Mum and Dad fight.

07:58.189 --> 08:01.223
- Hi.
- You're letting light in.

08:10.389 --> 08:13.256
- Want a hand?
- I don't need your help.

08:16.189 --> 08:19.423
Not bad, man. Some choice cuts.

08:21.655 --> 08:25.102
But your prime, A-grade, <i>numero uno...</i>

08:25.182 --> 08:27.235
<i>...piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance...</i>

08:27.589 --> 08:29.975
...is gonna have to be...

08:30.055 --> 08:31.776
...yeah!

08:31.856 --> 08:33.876
This shit's got a date
with the local photocopier.

08:33.956 --> 08:36.222
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

08:37.222 --> 08:39.956
You want to live the dream, don't ya?

08:40.056 --> 08:43.076
Want the world to see
your amazing photography?

08:43.155 --> 08:47.242
Well, lucky you got friends like us,
even if you're too stupid to realize it.

08:47.322 --> 08:49.772
Dude, New York had nothing to do with you.

08:50.189 --> 08:52.189
You don't ever get bored?

08:52.289 --> 08:54.242
Same old shit every day?

08:54.322 --> 08:56.542
Don't you ever want to get out of here?

08:56.622 --> 08:59.875
<i>Hombre...</i> I'm a god here.

08:59.955 --> 09:03.022
Weed to smoke, bitches to fuck.

09:03.356 --> 09:06.822
- Fags to bash.
- What's he done to you?

09:07.289 --> 09:09.689
Let me explain to you the law of the jungle.

09:10.705 --> 09:13.755
You want to run with the wolves,
you gotta kill a few lambs.

09:15.256 --> 09:17.489
So which one you gonna be?

09:20.422 --> 09:24.489
- Fine. Go nuts.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

09:25.356 --> 09:27.709
Now, can you stop being a buzzkill?

09:27.789 --> 09:30.449
Please? It's Halloween.

10:49.621 --> 10:51.189
Yeah!

11:11.523 --> 11:13.355
Care to do the honors?

11:14.222 --> 11:17.622
- Law of the jungle, huh?
- We all live by it, mate.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.589
What are you meant to be?

12:26.669 --> 12:28.824
A sheep in wolves' clothing?

12:29.488 --> 12:31.076
Whatever.

12:31.655 --> 12:35.056
Halloween's just an American
invention to sell lollies.

12:39.689 --> 12:41.222
Incorrect.

12:57.655 --> 13:00.522
Oh, yeah? Enlighten me.

13:07.455 --> 13:11.709
'Tis the night,
the night of the grave's delight.

13:11.789 --> 13:14.275
And the warlocks are at their play.

13:14.755 --> 13:18.342
Ye think that without,
the wild winds shout...

13:18.422 --> 13:21.656
...but no, it is they, it is they.

15:21.922 --> 15:25.683
Nice pic. But not your finest hour.

15:25.763 --> 15:27.389
The boys think it is.

15:30.712 --> 15:34.189
'Cause I know they're the first ones
I'd turn to for an art critique.

15:35.255 --> 15:38.375
- What's the problem?
- Who said there was a problem?

15:38.455 --> 15:40.842
You only fry your brain
when there's something on it.

15:40.922 --> 15:42.756
My brain's fine.

15:43.823 --> 15:45.822
At least nangs don't give you cancer.

15:47.855 --> 15:49.675
It's worth it.

15:49.755 --> 15:52.111
Hey, why don't you come down from there?

15:52.191 --> 15:56.642
I hate heights. My bedroom's on the
first floor, and even that freaks me out.

15:56.722 --> 15:59.342
There are way more scary things than falling.

16:07.722 --> 16:10.923
Sort of closing,
circling around her, and then...

16:20.021 --> 16:23.255
You know, you're a much nicer guy
when you're not around them.

16:23.855 --> 16:25.922
We all do shit to fit in.

16:27.055 --> 16:28.809
Is it worth it?

16:28.889 --> 16:32.010
Just 'cause they're good with
a sodastream, doesn't make them...

16:32.090 --> 16:34.155
<i>...amigos para siempre.</i>

16:36.155 --> 16:40.388
- How about you back off my mates?
- These guys don't get you.

16:43.689 --> 16:45.489
We're teenagers.

16:46.722 --> 16:49.742
Nobody gets us. That's half the fun.

16:49.822 --> 16:51.355
No.

16:52.589 --> 16:55.388
Everyone has somebody who understands them.

16:58.921 --> 17:02.322
You're not the only one who wants
out of this town, you know.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.241
Who said I want out?

17:05.320 --> 17:07.555
Got everything I need right here.

17:10.855 --> 17:14.055
Weed to smoke, fags to bash, bitches to...

17:14.888 --> 17:16.388
...fuck.

17:21.320 --> 17:23.439
Spliff's up.

17:24.288 --> 17:25.775
Romany?

17:25.855 --> 17:27.655
Tokey-toke?

17:39.887 --> 17:41.954
What about you, coz?

17:47.221 --> 17:49.055
Another toke?

17:49.455 --> 17:51.522
I'm good.

17:58.055 --> 18:00.773
Corey! Where are you going?

19:36.722 --> 19:39.555
Oh, shit! I'm late for work.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.222
Skip it.

19:45.955 --> 19:48.275
- Wait.
- Some of us gotta earn a buck.

19:48.355 --> 19:52.041
Yeah, like daddy wouldn't
buy you anything you asked for.

19:52.121 --> 19:56.845
What's wrong? You scared the baby birds
are all grown up and leaving the nest?

19:56.925 --> 19:58.774
Poor Jango.

19:58.854 --> 20:02.675
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Move! I've got graveyard shift.

20:02.754 --> 20:05.622
Then you're... right where you need to be.

20:09.155 --> 20:12.522
Boys! We're moving out. Get up.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.888
Quicker! Let's go.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.455
- Trick or treat.
- -Hey, Deirdre, you coming?

20:46.422 --> 20:48.012
Hey, you okay?

20:52.455 --> 20:54.655
Are you trying to kill me?

20:54.954 --> 20:56.788
Oh, fuck!

20:58.255 --> 21:00.309
Why can't you arseholes leave me alone?

21:00.988 --> 21:02.222
You don't own the park.

21:02.302 --> 21:05.158
Shouldn't you be with your wolves
gang-banging some mental defective...

21:05.238 --> 21:07.374
...from the drama class?

21:07.454 --> 21:09.698
- At least I got mates.
- Yeah, I'm sure they're awesome...

21:09.778 --> 21:13.108
- ...once you get to know them.
- Yeah, they are.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.388
Then why are you here?

21:27.421 --> 21:29.288
You're bleeding.

21:52.388 --> 21:54.235
Oh, shit!

22:01.021 --> 22:03.821
- Still gullible.
- Oh, you fucker!

22:05.955 --> 22:08.529
And then you wonder why nobody likes you.

22:08.788 --> 22:11.808
- Got anything to eat?
- Do I look like a servo?

22:11.888 --> 22:14.854
- You must have scored trick or treating.
- It's kids stuff, man.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.205
- We're kids.
- Well, you, maybe.

22:17.285 --> 22:21.009
Right. I forgot, gramps.
That's why you're dressed as teen wolf.

22:21.089 --> 22:23.122
And what are you supposed to be?

22:24.121 --> 22:25.921
Your mum?

22:30.431 --> 22:33.322
What? Jonah. Hey!

22:33.788 --> 22:36.208
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:36.288 --> 22:39.821
Wasn't cool. You can hit me if you want.

22:40.021 --> 22:42.255
One free hit, anywhere you want.

22:44.221 --> 22:46.055
Walk me home.

22:47.321 --> 22:49.155
I'm not gonna hit you.

22:50.005 --> 22:52.205
You're gonna walk me home instead.

22:52.854 --> 22:54.875
Get fucked. I'm not going anywhere with you.

22:54.955 --> 22:57.321
Maybe I have a concussion.

22:57.421 --> 22:59.774
Maybe I'll get lost.

22:59.854 --> 23:02.489
Maybe I'll fall and never wake up.

23:03.555 --> 23:06.941
Or maybe, you owe me...

23:07.021 --> 23:08.888
...old pal.

23:18.688 --> 23:21.522
If I knew they were coming,
I'd have baked a cake.

23:23.588 --> 23:26.834
Fine, but we're going now. Alright? Move it.

23:28.954 --> 23:32.588
- But aren't we gonna say hello first?
- Hurry it up, dickhead.

24:21.521 --> 24:24.555
Hey. Notice where we are?

24:25.754 --> 24:27.588
A bridge?

24:28.588 --> 24:30.455
Not just any bridge.

24:35.921 --> 24:37.955
The bridge over Cocytus.

24:38.455 --> 24:40.292
Where the veils are thin...

24:40.521 --> 24:44.322
...and once we cross,
we leave the mortal realm.

24:46.221 --> 24:49.674
Once we cross, we leave the mortal realm.

24:49.754 --> 24:53.555
And enter the world of enchantment,
where we see things as they really are.

24:55.021 --> 24:57.055
Where dreams are true.

24:57.654 --> 24:59.488
Stories too.

25:02.921 --> 25:04.754
I miss that game.

25:05.021 --> 25:07.288
Everything was simpler then.

25:08.355 --> 25:11.422
- And boring.
- "Boring"?

25:11.788 --> 25:15.908
We saw zombies and ghosts and werewolves.

25:16.088 --> 25:19.488
- I was never bored.
- It was just a stupid game.

25:21.388 --> 25:25.034
It was kids, trying to spook each other
with a bunch of fairy tales...

25:25.114 --> 25:27.042
...and chickenshit dares.

25:28.221 --> 25:30.454
Well, let's play again.

25:30.888 --> 25:34.308
- We're not kids anymore.
- We're not grown-ups either.

25:34.388 --> 25:37.389
Not yet. And besides...

25:37.888 --> 25:40.088
...I have something to show you.

25:42.588 --> 25:46.988
Believe me, there's nothing you could
show me that I'd possibly give a shit about.

25:47.821 --> 25:49.888
You sure about that?

25:58.454 --> 26:00.521
Your head still hurt?

26:01.121 --> 26:02.895
Excruciating.

26:04.488 --> 26:08.288
This thing that you wanted to show me,
it'd better blow my mind, alright?

26:09.205 --> 26:10.672
It's a promise.

26:18.122 --> 26:21.521
This is just for tonight. Don't think
'cause we're talking, we're friends.

26:22.821 --> 26:24.688
I wouldn't dream of it.

26:27.621 --> 26:30.875
And remember the rules.
Game isn't over till we get home.

26:30.955 --> 26:33.588
No wimping out midway through. I know.

26:36.221 --> 26:38.088
Ready to cross?

26:41.021 --> 26:42.821
You're on.

26:46.854 --> 26:48.741
<i>'Tis the night...</i>

26:48.821 --> 26:52.621
<i>...the night of the grave's delight.</i>

27:04.088 --> 27:05.655
Hey.

27:06.055 --> 27:07.888
Short cut.

27:09.854 --> 27:13.088
It rained last week.
I'm not going in some deathtrap drain.

27:14.088 --> 27:16.108
Come on. This is Cocytus.

27:16.188 --> 27:18.608
It's more than a drain. It's a passageway.

27:18.688 --> 27:22.721
It could lead us anywhere.
Where's your sense of adventure?

27:23.688 --> 27:26.694
Where's your common sense?
I don't want to go in there.

27:26.774 --> 27:30.255
Scared? Scared certain death lurks within?

27:31.021 --> 27:33.288
It's not death I'm scared of.

27:34.888 --> 27:36.688
Jeannie was scared.

27:37.854 --> 27:39.721
Is this part of the game?

27:40.454 --> 27:42.721
Haven't you heard the stories?

27:45.155 --> 27:47.021
Once there was...

27:48.317 --> 27:50.454
...and once there was not.

27:51.621 --> 27:55.654
<i>A girl called Jeannie
who was afraid of the dark.</i>

27:55.754 --> 27:59.554
<i>She played Cocytus too with her older sister.</i>

28:00.421 --> 28:06.050
<i>In her fantasy, they were princesses
living in a castle far, far away.</i>

28:06.621 --> 28:09.641
<i>Two dreamers, united against the world...</i>

28:10.221 --> 28:13.022
<i>...waiting for their lives to begin.</i>

28:13.888 --> 28:16.888
<i>And one day, the knights came.</i>

28:17.721 --> 28:20.955
<i>But they weren't valiant or brave.</i>

28:21.654 --> 28:26.341
<i>And though they were pretty,
the girls weren't wise.</i>

28:26.421 --> 28:29.217
<i>For wolves may lurk...</i>

28:29.296 --> 28:31.684
<i>...in any guise.</i>

28:34.188 --> 28:38.521
<i>She didn't want to be left behind,
so she followed.</i>

28:42.055 --> 28:45.176
<i>But the distance between them
grew and grew...</i>

28:45.255 --> 28:49.088
<i>...until she could barely
see her sister anymore.</i>

28:54.504 --> 28:57.205
<i>While Jeannie was afraid of the dark...</i>

28:57.285 --> 28:59.967
<i>...she was more scared of being left behind.</i>

29:03.420 --> 29:04.775
Katherine!

29:04.855 --> 29:07.774
<i>But Jeannie didn't know
that there are some dark places...</i>

29:07.854 --> 29:10.122
<i>...one should never walk alone.</i>

29:12.254 --> 29:14.475
<i>For tunnels can be longer than they appear.</i>

29:14.555 --> 29:16.442
Katherine!

29:16.522 --> 29:20.218
<i>And there are things in this world
we don't read about in the storybooks.</i>

29:23.138 --> 29:25.972
<i>Not everyone can survive the dark.</i>

29:31.354 --> 29:33.188
Did she die?

29:33.988 --> 29:36.421
Can't have a good story without a dead body.

29:37.287 --> 29:41.078
Now she's just another lonely ghost
haunting these tunnels.

29:41.157 --> 29:42.988
The saddest part...

29:43.838 --> 29:46.105
...she doesn't even know she's dead.

29:47.287 --> 29:49.108
Ghosts, huh?

29:50.287 --> 29:52.825
Suppose you believe in the tooth fairy too.

29:52.905 --> 29:54.641
Light a match.

29:54.721 --> 29:58.143
Only when she sees light
does she realize she's dead.

29:59.254 --> 30:02.174
And her scream will stay with you
till the day you die.

30:02.254 --> 30:03.509
- You're trippin'.
- Light it.

30:03.589 --> 30:06.021
- You're retarded.
- You're scared.

30:10.654 --> 30:12.688
Least I'm not the only one.

31:20.904 --> 31:22.738
Be ready.

31:25.921 --> 31:28.275
Yeah, Kurt Cobain.
You don't know who Kurt Cobain is?

31:28.355 --> 31:29.368
No.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.054
Hey!

32:11.888 --> 32:13.688
Who wants to go hunting?

32:32.574 --> 32:36.107
Miss Susie had a steamboat.

32:36.187 --> 32:39.021
The steamboat had a bell.

32:39.621 --> 32:42.474
Miss Susie went to heaven.

32:42.954 --> 32:45.755
The steamboat went to hell.

32:55.554 --> 32:57.154
I wish you'd go away.

33:04.621 --> 33:07.288
We taking High Street or Cotham?

33:14.320 --> 33:16.554
I'm not falling for your shit again.

33:23.320 --> 33:25.154
Yeah, I am.

33:42.220 --> 33:45.287
Suppose you want to walk
on the other side of the street.

33:46.721 --> 33:48.921
This place doesn't scare me anymore.

33:51.920 --> 33:53.788
Yeah, right.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.354
You used to wet yourself
when we passed Boo Radley's.

34:03.454 --> 34:05.254
His name is Edward.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.920
It's open.

34:23.054 --> 34:24.873
I'm not going inside.

34:25.353 --> 34:27.987
You have to. We're playing Cocytus.

34:32.487 --> 34:36.121
When exactly did someone shove a straw
up your arse and suck out all the fun?

34:41.688 --> 34:43.254
Fine.

34:44.187 --> 34:46.821
Hey. Can I borrow your board for a second?

35:01.987 --> 35:04.205
- Guess you'd better go get it.
- Fuck!

35:28.788 --> 35:31.174
- This is where it happened.
- What? Let me out.

35:31.254 --> 35:34.721
Poor Edward. He was only ten years old.

35:35.920 --> 35:38.174
I'm gonna kick you really hard in the face.

35:38.454 --> 35:40.741
Edward's dreams were so big.

35:40.820 --> 35:43.341
They were like universes unfolding forever.

35:46.020 --> 35:49.449
In Edward's world, a paper plane...

35:49.529 --> 35:51.610
...could be a turbojet...

35:51.887 --> 35:54.087
<i>...fighting the forces of darkness.</i>

35:59.987 --> 36:03.621
<i>The trees were allies,
hiding you in their branches.</i>

36:05.488 --> 36:08.488
<i>And Edward ruled it all from his island base.</i>

36:12.688 --> 36:17.174
<i>And then, one summer's day,
Edward made a promise...</i>

36:17.254 --> 36:20.275
<i>...here in the presence
of the masters of the universe...</i>

36:20.355 --> 36:23.421
<i>...the sea monkeys and the galactic army.</i>

36:23.987 --> 36:27.374
<i>He swore an oath to follow his dreams...</i>

36:27.454 --> 36:30.074
<i>...no matter how ridiculous...</i>

36:30.154 --> 36:34.555
<i>...to explore the shadows,
no matter how scary.</i>

36:36.920 --> 36:39.188
<i>And his vow was heard.</i>

36:40.521 --> 36:43.588
You absolute muppet!

36:44.787 --> 36:49.677
<i>When you're a kid, you want to explore
and see what's hiding in the shadows...</i>

36:49.756 --> 36:52.207
<i>...even if it scares the shit out of you.</i>

36:52.287 --> 36:54.721
<i>You'll cross the bridge over Cocytus.</i>

36:55.287 --> 36:56.979
<i>But...</i>

36:57.059 --> 37:00.476
<i>...as people grow older,
they lose that wonder.</i>

37:00.787 --> 37:04.455
<i>Scary things aren't fun anymore, just scary.</i>

37:05.320 --> 37:07.188
<i>So they shut them out.</i>

37:13.354 --> 37:17.041
<i>The dreams he once promised
to live were stored away in boxes...</i>

37:17.421 --> 37:19.674
<i>...stored away for another day...</i>

37:19.753 --> 37:23.840
<i>...and the days passed,
and the dreams were quickly forgotten.</i>

37:24.420 --> 37:25.878
<i>But...</i>

37:25.958 --> 37:28.633
<i>...abandon your dreams and they can become...</i>

37:29.654 --> 37:31.304
...resentful.

37:31.554 --> 37:35.954
<i>And as poor Edward let life's
little compromises accumulate...</i>

37:36.654 --> 37:41.223
<i>...the gap between who he was
and who he wanted to be...</i>

37:41.303 --> 37:43.186
<i>...grew larger.</i>

37:44.187 --> 37:48.421
<i>And as his dreams turned to darklings...</i>

37:48.521 --> 37:51.988
<i>...the sparkle faded from his eyes.</i>

38:01.854 --> 38:03.920
<i>Now he sits there...</i>

38:04.421 --> 38:07.174
<i>...in front of the TV, late into the night...</i>

38:07.254 --> 38:09.860
<i>...with the volume turned way up.</i>

38:10.254 --> 38:14.121
<i>And he knows that one day,
he'll have to pay the price...</i>

38:14.720 --> 38:18.787
<i>...for breaking his promise
and abandoning his dreams.</i>

38:26.953 --> 38:28.807
<i>And that price...</i>

38:28.887 --> 38:31.740
<i>...is why I don't ever...</i>

38:31.820 --> 38:33.887
<i>...want to grow up.</i>

38:42.320 --> 38:44.387
Shit! Get off!

38:48.454 --> 38:50.341
Do you expect me to believe that?

38:50.421 --> 38:54.898
Sometimes you have to pull back a piece
of reality when it gets in the way.

38:55.620 --> 38:57.355
I think you're full of shit.

38:58.521 --> 39:00.554
Take a look in the window.

39:04.953 --> 39:06.673
You look in it.

39:06.753 --> 39:08.907
I'm not the one that doesn't believe.

39:08.987 --> 39:10.773
It's, what...

39:10.853 --> 39:12.640
...twenty meters?

39:12.720 --> 39:14.374
Then I'll let you out.

40:13.820 --> 40:15.654
Trick or treat!

40:17.620 --> 40:19.198
Shit!

40:26.987 --> 40:28.988
Why the fuck did you do that?

40:29.720 --> 40:32.194
- Come on. It was funny.
- You know I hate being scared.

40:32.274 --> 40:34.074
No, I don't.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.640
The Corey I knew loved being scared.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.740
Halloween was his favorite day of the year.

40:39.820 --> 40:42.540
His head was full of dreams
he was gonna live.

40:42.620 --> 40:44.620
What happened to you?

40:48.120 --> 40:49.920
It's called survival.

40:51.187 --> 40:53.187
Law of the jungle.

40:53.687 --> 40:55.188
Survival.

41:02.288 --> 41:04.088
You clearly don't have a concussion.

41:06.454 --> 41:08.677
Find your own way home, right?

41:14.454 --> 41:15.734
Okay, truce.

41:17.287 --> 41:19.473
I'll stop trying to freak you out if...

41:19.553 --> 41:22.187
<i>...you stop running away for once.</i>

41:27.424 --> 41:29.520
I'll even make it up to you.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.421
How?

41:40.120 --> 41:41.640
School?

41:42.120 --> 41:43.604
Best years of our lives.

41:46.420 --> 41:49.220
You have a funny way
of making it up to people.

41:57.620 --> 41:59.487
Chuck us your board.

41:59.987 --> 42:01.787
What about security?

42:05.387 --> 42:07.587
Is there anything you're not scared of?

42:11.420 --> 42:13.487
I didn't say I was scared.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.720
I just have a cautionary nature.

43:50.787 --> 43:52.313
Boom.

44:08.319 --> 44:10.954
See? Easy as.

44:22.487 --> 44:25.034
You know, most people
aren't really scared of heights.

44:25.114 --> 44:27.553
At least... not of falling.

44:27.853 --> 44:29.854
What are they scared of, then?

44:30.620 --> 44:32.653
They're scared they'll jump.

44:35.887 --> 44:38.108
Is this the thing you wanted to show me?

44:38.587 --> 44:40.854
This is a thing I wanted to show you.

44:44.987 --> 44:48.241
Shit. What's with all the birds?

44:48.720 --> 44:51.520
They say animals know when they're gonna die.

44:52.220 --> 44:54.420
So they come here for their final moments.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.154
I like to keep them company.

45:00.087 --> 45:02.120
Nobody should die alone.

45:46.853 --> 45:48.943
When my dog died, he knew.

45:50.087 --> 45:53.353
Went off behind the rubbish tip
at the back of the yard.

45:54.887 --> 45:57.154
Took us, like, three days to find him.

46:00.053 --> 46:01.920
My mum knew.

46:02.753 --> 46:06.767
She was always worried, 'cause she had me
late, that she wouldn't always be around.

46:10.286 --> 46:14.887
That's why she always used to tell stories
about fantasy lands where I'd be safe.

46:17.687 --> 46:19.920
It's one way to survive, I guess.

46:27.853 --> 46:30.253
Is that why she always played that song?

46:31.120 --> 46:32.695
You remember that?

46:37.348 --> 46:42.971
<i>When you walk through a storm</i>

46:43.051 --> 46:48.273
<i>Hold your head up high</i>

46:48.353 --> 46:50.020
You shouldn't sing.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.540
It's bullshit, anyway.

46:56.820 --> 46:58.673
"You'll never walk alone."

46:58.753 --> 47:00.707
I'd rather be alone.

47:00.787 --> 47:03.054
No one to rely on but yourself.

47:03.386 --> 47:05.653
No one to drag you down.

47:06.219 --> 47:08.718
Nobody to have your back either.

47:10.653 --> 47:13.339
I remember this exhibition at the museum.

47:13.419 --> 47:15.253
There was a quote.

47:15.553 --> 47:19.354
"Man is by nature a social animal.

47:19.987 --> 47:23.988
Anyone who does not partake of society...

47:25.020 --> 47:26.854
...is either a beast...

47:28.620 --> 47:30.420
...or a God."

47:32.353 --> 47:35.109
Jango would say you're a little lamb.

47:35.189 --> 47:37.253
At least I'm not a beast.

47:37.807 --> 47:40.471
Can you say the same, dances with wolves?

47:50.386 --> 47:54.220
If there's one thing I won't miss,
it's these corridors.

47:59.219 --> 48:01.487
Feels like we should do a nudie run.

48:06.019 --> 48:08.220
Or you too scared of security?

48:10.453 --> 48:13.339
It's not security you need
to be worried about.

48:13.420 --> 48:15.907
It's the wolves in the walls that'll get ya.

48:16.619 --> 48:19.086
<i>I hoped we were done with these stories.</i>

48:19.853 --> 48:21.654
<i>This isn't a story.</i>

48:22.286 --> 48:24.553
<i>Everyone notices different things.</i>

48:25.253 --> 48:27.654
Some notice the moment you change your hair.

48:28.453 --> 48:31.253
Others always notice
what shoes you're wearing.

48:33.453 --> 48:35.087
I noticed them change.

48:39.453 --> 48:42.120
<i>It was the smell I noticed first.</i>

48:43.019 --> 48:47.053
<i>The stench of twisting, multiplying hormones.</i>

48:47.988 --> 48:50.110
<i>It always preceded them.</i>

48:50.520 --> 48:54.320
<i>No amount of cheap safeway
deodorant can cover that odor.</i>

48:59.887 --> 49:03.120
I saw skin disappear
beneath unwelcome hair...

49:03.940 --> 49:06.840
<i>...voices deepen into growls.</i>

49:06.920 --> 49:09.120
<i>Like a virus, it spread.</i>

49:09.753 --> 49:12.373
<i>And once that toxin poisons you...</i>

49:12.853 --> 49:16.127
<i>...you're capable of doing things
you never thought you'd do...</i>

49:16.787 --> 49:18.888
<i>...all in the name of survival.</i>

49:24.514 --> 49:27.009
<i>No matter where you hide...</i>

49:27.089 --> 49:28.969
<i>...they sniff you out.</i>

49:40.653 --> 49:42.720
And for those that didn't change...

49:44.387 --> 49:46.654
<i>...those that were left behind...</i>

49:53.019 --> 49:55.887
<i>...those that didn't have
the taste for blood...</i>

49:59.986 --> 50:03.000
<i>...there was only one thing you could do.</i>

50:34.653 --> 50:35.841
Jonah!

50:59.787 --> 51:01.320
Jonah?

51:19.720 --> 51:21.787
There's only one thing you can do.

52:37.786 --> 52:41.440
Welcome to the library, the sanctuary
for geeks, freaks and outcasts.

52:41.520 --> 52:44.608
Guess you're one of us now.
One of us! One of us!

52:44.688 --> 52:47.573
- Why'd you disappear?
- To see how you liked it.

52:47.653 --> 52:50.487
- I didn't.
- Well, color me surprised.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.140
- Is there another way out of here?
- In a coffin?

53:08.220 --> 53:10.367
You really are no help.

53:23.587 --> 53:26.038
Well, I guess we're saved, then.

53:26.118 --> 53:27.906
- Wait.
- What?

53:27.986 --> 53:30.813
They're your friends.
What's the worst they could do?

53:30.893 --> 53:33.117
How's this for a chaos theory, arsehole?

53:35.252 --> 53:37.188
Yeah, Jango.

53:37.388 --> 53:40.187
He decked you sober.
You don't want to see him pissed.

53:41.253 --> 53:42.806
There you go.

53:42.886 --> 53:45.086
- Cheers.
- Wear that.

53:52.186 --> 53:55.187
He won't hurt me if he knows
I'm with you. Right?

53:59.752 --> 54:02.220
You still don't want to be seen with me.

54:04.119 --> 54:06.520
Nobody means anything to you, do they?

54:12.653 --> 54:14.920
Shitty books that you love so much.

54:19.553 --> 54:21.554
Shove these fireworks...

54:24.253 --> 54:25.689
I've got an idea.

54:27.952 --> 54:29.819
Shut up.

54:30.519 --> 54:32.406
Did you hear something?

54:32.486 --> 54:34.406
Wait, what?

54:34.486 --> 54:36.487
Come out and play.

54:39.219 --> 54:41.487
Where are you?

55:10.819 --> 55:12.620
Thank you.

55:37.520 --> 55:41.521
Do you know Laura Premble?
This place kinda reminds me of her.

55:43.019 --> 55:46.287
This isn't one of those
"Penthouse forum" stories, is it?

55:47.319 --> 55:50.772
Well... she was the first person
I, you know...

55:50.852 --> 55:53.053
...fooled around with.

55:54.453 --> 55:57.686
But no, a bunch of us
came here after year 11 formal.

55:58.719 --> 56:02.153
I barely knew her, but...
everyone was pairing up.

56:02.953 --> 56:04.819
I remember thinking...

56:05.253 --> 56:07.053
"...jackpot!"

56:10.019 --> 56:11.886
You liked her?

56:12.186 --> 56:13.753
Yeah.

56:15.652 --> 56:18.139
But, man, she could drink.

56:18.219 --> 56:20.487
She drank so much.

56:29.053 --> 56:31.120
She just got kinda quiet.

56:36.119 --> 56:38.753
She just sat there staring off into the dark.

56:44.886 --> 56:49.172
And she dropped a bottle. It smashed
on the concrete. She didn't even move.

56:56.353 --> 56:58.586
It's like she wasn't really there.

57:04.286 --> 57:06.353
It's not much of a story, I guess.

57:07.186 --> 57:09.020
What'd you do after formal?

57:11.319 --> 57:12.853
I didn't go.

57:16.153 --> 57:17.953
Oh, well...

57:22.153 --> 57:23.949
...I guess you didn't miss much.

58:04.219 --> 58:07.806
<i>Miss Susie had a steamboat,
the steamboat had a bell</i>

58:07.886 --> 58:11.713
<i>Miss Susie went to heaven,
the steamboat went to...</i>

58:15.519 --> 58:19.073
<i>Hello, operator, give me number nine</i>

58:19.153 --> 58:21.774
<i>- If you disconnect me
- I'll chop off your...</i>

58:21.854 --> 58:25.472
<i>Behind the refrigerator,
there was a piece of glass</i>

58:25.552 --> 58:28.516
<i>Miss Susie sat upon it,
and broke her little...</i>

58:28.596 --> 58:31.737
<i>Ask me no more questions,
tell me no more lies</i>

58:31.817 --> 58:33.627
<i>The boys are in the bathroom</i>

58:33.707 --> 58:36.340
<i>Zipping up their... flies are in the meadow</i>

58:36.420 --> 58:37.974
<i>Bees are in the park</i>

58:38.054 --> 58:41.974
<i>Miss Susie and her boyfriend
are kissing in the D-A-R-K</i>

58:42.054 --> 58:45.711
<i>D-A-R-K, D-A-R-K...</i>

58:58.253 --> 59:00.119
You still hungry?

59:23.586 --> 59:25.539
What the fuck? It's just me.

59:25.619 --> 59:27.486
I thought you hated Halloween.

59:29.619 --> 59:31.652
Twick or tweat.

59:34.886 --> 59:37.686
Here. You stink.

59:39.786 --> 59:41.839
It's not my fault there's a heatwave.

59:41.919 --> 59:45.719
It's the hole in the ozone layer.
Those spray cans don't help.

59:48.219 --> 59:50.953
You know in some places
it snows on Halloween?

59:51.986 --> 59:54.036
You like snow?

59:54.219 --> 59:56.053
I've never seen it.

59:57.419 --> 01:00:00.652
That's why I'm saving up all
my slave wage from this dump.

01:00:01.452 --> 01:00:03.719
So I can fly away to Canada.

01:00:04.419 --> 01:00:06.253
Get a log cabin.

01:00:07.719 --> 01:00:09.606
It snows most of the year there.

01:00:09.686 --> 01:00:12.753
The rivers are so frozen,
you can skate on them.

01:00:16.352 --> 01:00:18.786
It snows quite a bit in New York too.

01:00:21.086 --> 01:00:23.153
You're gonna go, aren't you?

01:00:29.253 --> 01:00:31.273
Did you ever let down a friend?

01:00:31.352 --> 01:00:33.366
Like stand someone up?

01:00:33.816 --> 01:00:37.159
Sure. If I had a dollar
for every person I left waiting...

01:00:37.239 --> 01:00:39.519
...under the clocks at Flinders Street...

01:00:42.153 --> 01:00:44.019
...I'd have nine dollars.

01:00:44.786 --> 01:00:46.287
No.

01:00:48.119 --> 01:00:49.986
I mean...

01:00:51.586 --> 01:00:55.586
...did you ever say that you'd be there
for someone no matter what...

01:00:58.002 --> 01:01:00.002
...and then you weren't?

01:01:02.385 --> 01:01:04.820
I had this one friend in primary school.

01:01:06.986 --> 01:01:10.606
She even joined me at callispastics,
even though she was a total unco.

01:01:10.786 --> 01:01:12.652
What happened to her?

01:01:15.385 --> 01:01:17.419
Never really thought about it.

01:01:19.186 --> 01:01:21.281
I went to a different high school...

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:23.983
...started hanging out with other girls.

01:01:24.652 --> 01:01:26.686
The cool kids, you know.

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:32.253
I just couldn't keep playing
with my little ponies forever, right?

01:01:35.219 --> 01:01:38.687
I guess I didn't notice when the gaps
between us got bigger and bigger.

01:01:41.752 --> 01:01:43.753
I haven't seen her for years.

01:01:46.352 --> 01:01:48.386
She was just a friend.

01:01:49.852 --> 01:01:51.386
Why?

01:01:53.953 --> 01:01:56.986
I guess sometimes you don't realize
who you've left behind.

01:02:00.519 --> 01:02:02.553
Or who's right in front of you.

01:02:06.919 --> 01:02:08.419
Yeah.

01:02:09.518 --> 01:02:10.903
Maybe.

01:02:13.739 --> 01:02:17.386
Or maybe you could get out
of your fucking diapers for once.

01:02:17.919 --> 01:02:22.006
You think you're frustrated here?
Try living in the same world in a skirt...

01:02:22.086 --> 01:02:25.639
...surrounded by a bunch of babies
who don't even notice you.

01:02:25.719 --> 01:02:28.131
Why can't you guys just grow up?

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:30.226
Girls do! We just stand here...

01:02:30.306 --> 01:02:35.016
...waiting, while you guys are stuck
with your heads in the... trees.

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:39.806
Is this 'cause I didn't
thank you for the slurpee?

01:02:39.886 --> 01:02:41.690
I don't under...

01:03:12.752 --> 01:03:14.619
We do want to grow up.

01:03:15.819 --> 01:03:18.672
There's just a part of us
that doesn't want to stop.

01:03:18.752 --> 01:03:20.319
Stop?

01:03:23.686 --> 01:03:25.552
Climbing trees.

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.119
Trick or treat!

01:03:31.452 --> 01:03:32.953
Great.

01:03:40.218 --> 01:03:43.706
Well! Ring-a-ding-ding, cozza.

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:47.106
You sly hound. Thought your head was hurting.

01:03:47.185 --> 01:03:48.973
Turns out you were just hurting for head.

01:03:49.053 --> 01:03:51.339
- Real smooth.
- Thank you.

01:03:51.419 --> 01:03:54.286
So? Where have you been?

01:03:55.218 --> 01:03:58.622
- Looking everywhere for you.
- Don't tell me you were getting bored?

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:01.386
Hey, Bobby. Want to go for a ride?

01:04:03.686 --> 01:04:05.186
Hey.

01:04:06.118 --> 01:04:07.683
You're not...

01:04:07.763 --> 01:04:10.792
...pissed about before, are ya?

01:04:12.085 --> 01:04:15.152
I mean, any hole's a goal, you know.

01:04:15.886 --> 01:04:18.285
Maybe you shouldn't talk about her like that.

01:04:20.419 --> 01:04:23.407
Is this true love? It is, isn't it?

01:04:50.953 --> 01:04:54.761
Anyway, we're not done yet.
The night's not over. Copies ready?

01:04:54.941 --> 01:04:56.519
Almost.

01:04:59.552 --> 01:05:01.419
Forget something?

01:05:05.852 --> 01:05:07.773
Hey, guess what we found at the cemetery.

01:05:07.853 --> 01:05:10.569
- What?
- The little fag's mother.

01:05:10.649 --> 01:05:12.143
Yeah.

01:05:12.223 --> 01:05:15.046
And wait till you see
what we did to her tombstone.

01:05:15.485 --> 01:05:17.552
We're gonna need photos of it.

01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:21.089
So... grab your shit. Let's go.

01:05:21.818 --> 01:05:23.538
Got everything?

01:05:23.618 --> 01:05:27.272
- Slushy. Did you get me my slushy?
- Yeah, yeah. I got your slushy.

01:05:27.452 --> 01:05:29.105
Thank you.

01:05:29.185 --> 01:05:30.719
Nah.

01:05:33.952 --> 01:05:35.452
What?

01:05:39.619 --> 01:05:41.419
What's the problem, cozza?

01:05:42.018 --> 01:05:44.419
Is he your boyfriend or something?

01:05:48.686 --> 01:05:51.285
- I don't want to be like that.
- Like what?

01:05:52.552 --> 01:05:54.052
Cruel.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:59.205
Didn't know you batted for that team.

01:05:59.285 --> 01:06:01.185
What if I did?

01:06:01.265 --> 01:06:03.352
Would you still be my friend?

01:06:03.686 --> 01:06:06.233
Or would you throw dead animals at my house?

01:06:06.313 --> 01:06:09.305
Alright, what... what are you saying, man?

01:06:09.385 --> 01:06:11.372
Maybe I'm not one of you anymore.

01:06:12.451 --> 01:06:13.985
Hey.

01:06:14.852 --> 01:06:16.686
You are one of us.

01:06:17.719 --> 01:06:19.552
Or you're nobody.

01:06:19.953 --> 01:06:22.187
I guess you're friends with nobody, then?

01:06:22.816 --> 01:06:24.663
Fuck you!

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.266
Fight! Fight!
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

01:06:46.485 --> 01:06:48.018
Mate.

01:06:48.786 --> 01:06:50.332
Nah.

01:07:03.752 --> 01:07:04.986
Corey!

01:07:19.019 --> 01:07:20.586
Fuck.

01:07:43.152 --> 01:07:44.719
Jonah!

01:07:46.586 --> 01:07:48.652
Jonah? You in there?

01:07:49.985 --> 01:07:51.486
Jonah?

01:08:15.418 --> 01:08:19.506
<i>Now he sits there, in front of the TV...</i>

01:08:19.586 --> 01:08:23.185
<i>...late into the night,
with the volume turned way up.</i>

01:12:08.751 --> 01:12:10.552
Turn off the light.

01:12:24.685 --> 01:12:26.552
Why'd you leave?

01:12:28.985 --> 01:12:31.018
You're the one who left.

01:12:40.618 --> 01:12:42.419
Come outside.

01:12:43.918 --> 01:12:45.805
- Why?
- 'Cause I want to explain.

01:12:45.885 --> 01:12:47.718
You can't.

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.918
Keep it.

01:13:23.519 --> 01:13:25.585
You're breaking the rules, you know.

01:13:28.119 --> 01:13:29.985
What rules?

01:13:31.152 --> 01:13:32.652
Cocytus.

01:13:34.519 --> 01:13:38.018
- Game doesn't stop till we get home.
- That's kids stuff.

01:13:39.918 --> 01:13:41.452
So?

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:45.152
We're kids.

01:13:47.152 --> 01:13:49.018
At least for tonight.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:01.119
You can be such a dick sometimes.

01:14:02.385 --> 01:14:03.885
Yeah.

01:14:05.051 --> 01:14:09.258
Come on. Best way to keep the wolf
from your door is to go to his.

01:14:29.785 --> 01:14:31.738
<i>One thing's for sure.</i>

01:14:31.818 --> 01:14:33.885
<i>Jango and I are no longer friends.</i>

01:14:40.918 --> 01:14:42.751
Thank you.

01:14:48.252 --> 01:14:50.485
Got time for one more house call.

01:14:54.985 --> 01:14:56.551
Fuck!

01:15:01.419 --> 01:15:03.106
Motherfucker.

01:17:00.401 --> 01:17:03.401
Are you trying to kill yourself? You'll fall.

01:17:04.185 --> 01:17:06.404
People aren't really scared of falling.

01:17:06.484 --> 01:17:10.038
- They're scared of jumping.
- I'm scared my dad will kill you.

01:17:10.118 --> 01:17:12.038
What are you doing here?

01:17:12.118 --> 01:17:14.985
- Is your face okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:17:16.851 --> 01:17:19.918
I just thought you might want
some snow on Halloween.

01:17:21.918 --> 01:17:24.574
- That stuff's toxic.
- So?

01:17:24.654 --> 01:17:27.485
- It'll give you cancer.
- It's worth it.

01:17:27.565 --> 01:17:31.585
- Romany, are you okay in there?
- I'm fine. Go back to bed.

01:17:32.517 --> 01:17:35.585
- You should go.
- One more thing.

01:17:41.585 --> 01:17:45.435
I owe you an apology.
I've been a real dick tonight.

01:17:46.351 --> 01:17:47.878
Just tonight?

01:17:49.218 --> 01:17:51.252
Maybe for a while.

01:17:54.018 --> 01:17:56.052
But I did notice you.

01:17:56.284 --> 01:18:01.252
And sometimes the boys just climb
the trees to get a better look at the view.

01:18:17.918 --> 01:18:19.718
Happy Halloween.

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:47.152
You'll catch your death if you stay
in the snow for too long.

01:19:18.217 --> 01:19:20.052
So, what happens now?

01:19:23.751 --> 01:19:26.605
I think this is where you show me
one of your callisthenic routines.

01:19:26.685 --> 01:19:29.085
I will punch you in the face.

01:19:34.685 --> 01:19:37.805
I guess you go back
to the company of wolves...

01:19:37.885 --> 01:19:40.752
...and I get to escape
to the wilds of Canada.

01:19:44.251 --> 01:19:45.752
Unless...

01:19:46.517 --> 01:19:48.085
Unless?

01:19:48.938 --> 01:19:50.485
Well...

01:19:51.284 --> 01:19:53.685
...I don't know for sure, but...

01:19:54.618 --> 01:19:58.052
...I imagine there are some pretty
good photography courses in Canada.

01:20:01.518 --> 01:20:04.552
There would be a lot of beautiful
things there to capture.

01:20:10.785 --> 01:20:12.852
Do you really want me to come?

01:20:13.551 --> 01:20:18.004
Sometimes it's just easier to live your dream
if you have someone to share it with.

01:20:19.251 --> 01:20:23.902
And... maybe you don't come to Canada, but...

01:20:25.085 --> 01:20:27.551
...we can make sure we both get out of here.

01:20:34.451 --> 01:20:37.738
What, if... if I live my dream,
you'll live yours?

01:20:37.818 --> 01:20:39.504
Yeah.

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.518
Want to swear?

01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:46.237
- Sure, motherfucker.
- No, I mean it.

01:20:46.317 --> 01:20:48.052
Let's do this.

01:20:48.518 --> 01:20:52.119
If you go back on this, I will come at
you in the black of some terrible night.

01:20:52.199 --> 01:20:55.268
And I will bring a pointy reckoning
that will shudder you.

01:21:04.384 --> 01:21:06.585
I'm through with breaking promises.

01:21:40.918 --> 01:21:43.237
- Don't fall.
- Too late.

01:21:43.317 --> 01:21:46.151
- Shut up.
- Okay.

01:22:13.184 --> 01:22:14.752
Jonah!

01:22:28.968 --> 01:22:30.171
Rex?

01:22:39.918 --> 01:22:42.318
Rex! Hey.

01:25:16.836 --> 01:25:23.841
<i>Oh, now feel it coming back again</i>

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:35.597
<i>Like a rolling thunder chasing the wind</i>

01:25:40.673 --> 01:25:47.138
<i>Forces pulling from the center
of the Earth again</i>

01:25:52.314 --> 01:25:56.112
<i>I can feel it</i>

01:25:58.177 --> 01:26:01.866
<i>I can feel it</i>

01:26:04.028 --> 01:26:08.077
<i>I can feel it</i>

01:26:09.685 --> 01:26:12.538
- Come on.
- <i>I can feel it</i>

01:26:12.618 --> 01:26:14.258
Let's get out of here.

01:26:18.451 --> 01:26:19.951
Jonah.

01:26:46.217 --> 01:26:48.618
Jonah! Stop!

01:26:57.717 --> 01:27:00.551
What was that place? Who is that man?

01:27:00.917 --> 01:27:04.285
- I don't know him.
- He looked familiar.

01:27:05.017 --> 01:27:08.837
We meet him twice.
First time, you don't remember.

01:27:08.917 --> 01:27:11.185
The second time, you never forget.

01:27:38.317 --> 01:27:40.384
What if I lied to you?

01:27:41.050 --> 01:27:43.018
When I said I didn't want to grow up?

01:27:52.551 --> 01:27:54.104
Run.

01:27:54.184 --> 01:27:56.870
Run! Run!

01:28:13.817 --> 01:28:15.395
Jonah!

01:28:45.151 --> 01:28:46.851
We need more light.

01:29:00.917 --> 01:29:02.485
Hey.

01:29:04.317 --> 01:29:06.318
They can't hurt us if we stick together.

01:29:07.217 --> 01:29:09.305
They won't let us go forward.

01:29:09.784 --> 01:29:13.251
Then let's go back,
where the dreams are true.

01:29:14.017 --> 01:29:15.637
The stories too.

01:29:51.284 --> 01:29:54.351
Jonah. Jonah.

01:31:08.717 --> 01:31:10.584
We need to go higher.

01:32:05.184 --> 01:32:07.051
My best friend.

01:32:07.717 --> 01:32:10.151
Why did we leave all this behind?

01:32:10.784 --> 01:32:13.584
- We needed more.
- Did you?

01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:17.721
<i>Do you remember that day?</i>

01:32:18.051 --> 01:32:20.055
<i>Like it was yesterday.</i>

01:32:20.135 --> 01:32:23.302
<i>It kinda was, since we kept it so close.</i>

01:32:25.617 --> 01:32:27.704
<i>It was Halloween then too.</i>

01:32:28.084 --> 01:32:31.704
<i>We were all dressed up.
I still had my first camera.</i>

01:32:31.784 --> 01:32:33.784
<i>Don't make it too real.</i>

01:32:34.684 --> 01:32:39.837
<i>It was getting late. And it isn't midnight
when young boys turn into pumpkins.</i>

01:32:39.917 --> 01:32:42.550
<i>It's when the street lights turn on.</i>

01:32:44.784 --> 01:32:46.617
<i>It was a bad idea.</i>

01:32:47.617 --> 01:32:51.051
<i>The boys knew that from the start, but...</i>

01:32:52.151 --> 01:32:54.751
<i>...nobody wants to be the one left behind.</i>

01:32:58.650 --> 01:33:02.051
<i>Even though tunnels
can be longer than they appear.</i>

01:33:05.184 --> 01:33:09.665
<i>And there are things in this world
we don't read about in storybooks.</i>

01:33:15.984 --> 01:33:19.871
<i>Wolves may lurk in any guise.</i>

01:33:20.984 --> 01:33:23.018
<i>And only in the dark...</i>

01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:26.684
<i>...do we learn how far we'll go to survive.</i>

01:33:27.817 --> 01:33:30.851
<i>Even if it means running
as fast as you can...</i>

01:33:31.717 --> 01:33:34.564
<i>...and leaving behind everything you value.</i>

01:33:42.317 --> 01:33:43.818
Corey.

01:33:48.784 --> 01:33:51.817
<i>And that was the last time
that they played Cocytus.</i>

01:34:14.117 --> 01:34:16.184
It'll be morning soon.

01:35:05.316 --> 01:35:07.185
Is it getting cold?

01:35:08.884 --> 01:35:10.751
Think so.

01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:18.951
We have to go home eventually.

01:35:21.283 --> 01:35:23.284
Then the game will be over.

01:35:28.617 --> 01:35:31.061
What would happen if we change the ending?

01:35:33.250 --> 01:35:34.851
What ending?

01:35:36.850 --> 01:35:38.851
To the story in the drain.

01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:43.617
What if I...

01:35:50.884 --> 01:35:53.433
- ...what if he stayed?
- He left.

01:35:56.316 --> 01:35:58.184
Maybe he didn't.

01:36:02.784 --> 01:36:04.984
Maybe it just seemed like he did.

01:36:07.450 --> 01:36:10.517
And as he was walking away, he turned back...

01:36:11.050 --> 01:36:13.651
...'cause he realized
who his real friend was.

01:36:14.384 --> 01:36:18.144
'Cause together, they could do anything.
They could cross the bridge to Cocytus.

01:36:18.223 --> 01:36:21.650
They could outwit the darklings.
They could outrun the wolves.

01:36:22.051 --> 01:36:24.450
Why couldn't they defeat two bullies?

01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:27.604
And then?

01:36:27.684 --> 01:36:30.884
And then they live their dreams
like they promised each other.

01:36:32.751 --> 01:36:34.817
That's what should have happened.

01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:38.484
I like that ending.

01:36:41.684 --> 01:36:43.884
But that's not what happened.

01:36:50.917 --> 01:36:52.784
I'm ready to show you now.

01:37:05.116 --> 01:37:07.150
This is where we say goodbye.

01:37:08.817 --> 01:37:11.051
This where you live now, homey?

01:37:12.216 --> 01:37:14.284
Yeah, real mature, smart-arse.

01:37:16.917 --> 01:37:19.150
Thought you were in a hurry to grow up.

01:37:22.283 --> 01:37:24.517
Maybe I was a bit hasty on that one.

01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:27.617
Good to hear it.

01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:47.650
I'm sorry.

01:37:51.617 --> 01:37:53.417
For leaving.

01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:59.416
You know...

01:37:59.683 --> 01:38:01.150
...tonight...

01:38:02.617 --> 01:38:04.884
...kind of made up for the rest of it.

01:38:18.917 --> 01:38:20.750
Turn around.

01:38:33.917 --> 01:38:35.550
Jonah!

01:38:36.116 --> 01:38:37.984
Hey, Jonah!

01:38:54.817 --> 01:38:58.050
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Jonah!

01:40:30.818 --> 01:40:32.350
Dad!

01:40:33.418 --> 01:40:35.644
Dad, are you there?

01:40:39.150 --> 01:40:40.983
Dad, I need you.

01:42:23.617 --> 01:42:26.251
Judging by the state of his...

01:42:29.717 --> 01:42:32.536
...the... condition...

01:42:32.915 --> 01:42:35.970
...he's in, they think he
must have been in the water...

01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:39.117
...since late afternoon.

01:42:41.216 --> 01:42:43.003
He must have...

01:42:43.083 --> 01:42:46.883
...fallen while he was crossing and...

01:42:49.949 --> 01:42:51.816
...hit his head.

01:42:57.083 --> 01:42:59.084
We climbed trees together.

01:43:05.150 --> 01:43:07.217
That was a long time ago.

01:43:16.983 --> 01:43:19.450
Are we still going to the lake this weekend?

01:43:21.849 --> 01:43:23.571
Only if you want to.

01:43:24.316 --> 01:43:25.850
Yeah.

01:43:27.816 --> 01:43:29.617
I do.

01:43:31.816 --> 01:43:33.617
Are you ready to go?

01:43:38.383 --> 01:43:40.850
I just want to stay here a little longer.

01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:46.250
Your friends are here.

01:44:31.517 --> 01:44:33.350
Forget something?

01:45:39.983 --> 01:45:42.236
Hey, you there? Can you hear me?

01:45:42.316 --> 01:45:44.303
<i>You're cutting in and out a bit.</i>

01:45:44.383 --> 01:45:48.394
Yeah, this Wi-Fi's bullshit.
Dude, how are the performances going?

01:45:48.474 --> 01:45:50.603
- <i>Full houses so far.</i>
- Really?

01:45:50.683 --> 01:45:53.050
<i>Hey, look. Can you see it?</i>

01:45:56.966 --> 01:46:00.186
- Is it snow?
- <i>Yeah. Happy Halloween.</i>

01:46:01.315 --> 01:46:02.769
<i>Where are you heading tonight?</i>

01:46:02.849 --> 01:46:06.570
The voice are paying me to get shots
of the parade in the village tonight.

01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:08.490
<i>What are you gonna be?</i>

01:46:11.715 --> 01:46:13.250
Romany?

01:46:15.016 --> 01:46:17.100
Romany? Hello?
