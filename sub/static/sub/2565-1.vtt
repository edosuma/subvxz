00:33.951 --> 00:38.047
<i>She came along the alley and up
the back stairs the way she always used to.</i>

00:39.248 --> 00:41.797
Doc hadn't seen her in over a year.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.961
Nobody had.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.630
Back then it was always sandals...

00:46.797 --> 00:49.175
...bottom half of a flower-print bikini...

00:49.341 --> 00:52.971
...and a faded
Country Joe and the Fish T-shirt.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.980
Tonight, she was all in flatland gear...

00:56.139 --> 00:58.813
...hair a lot shorter than he remembered...

00:58.976 --> 01:02.355
...looking just like she swore
she would never look.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.200
<i>Psst.</i>

01:16.952 --> 01:18.829
That you, Shasta?

01:23.292 --> 01:25.841
Thinks he's hallucinating.

01:26.503 --> 01:31.350
No, just a new package, I guess.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.024
I need your help, Doc.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.948
You know I have an office now?
It's like a day job and everything.

01:50.110 --> 01:54.365
I looked in the phone book
and almost went over there.

01:54.531 --> 01:59.128
Then I thought better for everyone
if this looks like a secret rendezvous.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.505
Is somebody keeping a close eye?

02:03.790 --> 02:07.294
Just spent an hour on surface streets
trying to make it look good.

02:13.884 --> 02:14.976
Uh...

02:16.553 --> 02:17.975
You want a beer?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.775
How about a beer?
You want a beer?

02:21.933 --> 02:23.105
Yeah.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.983
Uh...

02:37.741 --> 02:39.743
There's this guy.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.789
Gentleman of the straight-world persuasion?

02:49.211 --> 02:50.758
Okay, Doc.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.433
He's married.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.852
Some, uh, money situation?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.064
And the wife, uh, she knows about you?

03:05.227 --> 03:07.525
She's seeing somebody too.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.690
But it's not just the usual.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.700
I think they're working
on some creepy, little scheme.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.032
To make off with the hubby's fortune?

03:15.195 --> 03:19.166
Yeah, I think I've heard
of that happening once or twice.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.624
And you want me to do, uh, what exactly?

03:26.415 --> 03:28.463
Is they want me in on it.

03:30.127 --> 03:33.051
They think I'm the one who can reach him
when he's vulnerable.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.307
Or as much as he ever gets.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.931
Bare-ass and asleep.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.096
I knew you'd understand.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.523
Are you still trying to figure out
if it's right or wrong?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.486
Worse than that.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.415
How much loyalty I owe him.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.543
Groovy.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.836
All right...

04:05.996 --> 04:08.920
...emotions aside,
let's look at the rent.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.301
How much of, uh, your rent's
he been picking up?

04:11.460 --> 04:14.885
- All of it.
- Pretty, uh, hefty?

04:15.046 --> 04:16.514
For Hancock Park?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.392
You're giving him IOUs
for everything, of course.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.680
You fucker.
If I had known you were still this bitter...

04:22.846 --> 04:25.850
Me? I'm trying to be professional, is all.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.273
All right.

04:29.436 --> 04:34.317
How much have the, uh, wifey
and boyfriend offered to cut you in for?

04:37.152 --> 04:38.699
It isn't what you're thinking.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.081
Don't worry. Thinking comes later.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.452
What else?

04:48.371 --> 04:50.044
I'm not sure.

04:50.832 --> 04:54.052
It sounds like they wanna commit him
to a loony bin.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.216
<i>Back when they were together...</i>

04:59.424 --> 05:04.180
<i>...she could go weeks without anything
more complicated than a pout.</i>

05:04.346 --> 05:07.725
<i>Now she was laying some heavy combination
of face ingredients...</i>

05:07.933 --> 05:10.812
<i>...on Doc that he couldn't read at all.</i>

05:11.853 --> 05:13.400
Argh. Fuck.

05:13.563 --> 05:19.036
<i>Come to think of it, there'd
never been this much sorrow in her voice.</i>

05:19.194 --> 05:21.413
Heard you're seeing someone downtown?

05:21.613 --> 05:22.865
Penny?

05:24.074 --> 05:25.496
Some kind of junior DA?

05:26.868 --> 05:30.918
Yeah, you think, uh, somebody down there
could stop this before it happens?

05:31.373 --> 05:33.717
Not too many places
I could go with this, Doc.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.889
I'll talk to Penny.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.928
See what we can see.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.770
Your happy couple, they have names?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.770
It's Mickey Wolfmann.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.903
Who's always in the paper?
The real-estate big shot?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.320
Yeah.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.327
Can't tell anyone about this, Doc.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.750
Oh.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.130
Huh.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.463
Deaf and dumb, part of my job.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.087
How do I reach you?

06:21.631 --> 06:23.224
You don't.

06:23.967 --> 06:27.312
I moved out of my old place.
Staying where I can anymore.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.063
Don't ask.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.684
There's room here.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.485
Walk me down to my car?

06:41.693 --> 06:43.616
Someone might be watching.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.502
- You never did let me down, Doc.
- Don't worry. I'll...

06:54.664 --> 06:56.962
No, I mean, really. Ever.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.051
Sure I did.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.838
No. You were always true.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.472
You know, you don't have to go.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.265
Watch your toes.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.851
Vroom.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.688
<i>Doc ran through all the things
he hadn't asked Shasta.</i>

07:55.850 --> 07:57.727
<i>Like how much she'd come to depend on...</i>

07:57.894 --> 08:01.524
<i>Wolfmann's guaranteed level
of ease and power.</i>

08:01.690 --> 08:03.909
<i>And least askable of all:</i>

08:04.067 --> 08:07.571
<i>How passionately did she really feel
about old Mickey?</i>

08:11.366 --> 08:12.993
- Hey, what's up, Doc?
- Hey, Denis.

08:13.159 --> 08:16.379
What's up, man?
What's going on? Doing all right?

08:16.538 --> 08:18.916
<i>Doc knew the likely reply:</i>

08:19.082 --> 08:21.631
<i>"I love him. What else?"</i>

08:21.793 --> 08:23.716
<i>With the unspoken footnote...</i>

08:23.878 --> 08:27.758
<i>...that the word these days
was being way too overused.</i>

08:27.924 --> 08:29.426
What you looking at?

08:35.181 --> 08:36.433
You hungry?

08:36.599 --> 08:38.727
Like Godzilla says to Mothra, man:

08:38.893 --> 08:40.440
"Let's go eat someplace."

08:40.602 --> 08:43.402
<i>So when Doc and Denis came in that night...</i>

08:43.565 --> 08:46.785
<i>...it wasn't just the
usual hungry doper thing.</i>

08:46.985 --> 08:48.453
<i>It was something else.</i>

08:48.611 --> 08:52.536
<i>And with Neptune moving
at last out of the Scorpio death-trip...</i>

08:52.699 --> 08:56.454
<i>...and rising into the Sagittarian light
of the higher mind...</i>

08:56.619 --> 08:59.463
<i>...it was bound to be
something love-related.</i>

08:59.622 --> 09:02.091
<i>And I thought I knew what it was.</i>

09:02.250 --> 09:03.627
So...?

09:05.545 --> 09:08.219
She stuck her head in for a minute.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.429
You feeling broken up?

09:10.592 --> 09:13.562
Kind of weird seeing her again, you know?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.473
Yeah, I figured next time I saw her,
it'd be on the tube.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.482
Not in person.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.813
- Well, you'd better do something about this.
- Heh.

09:22.979 --> 09:23.980
Yeah, again?

09:24.147 --> 09:26.525
Can't tell you enough:
Change your hair, change your life.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.068
Mm.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.078
Mm. Well, what do you recommend?

09:31.237 --> 09:32.830
It's up to you.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.333
Follow your intuition.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.469
Hello?

09:50.632 --> 09:52.134
Hey, Aunt Reet?

09:53.635 --> 09:56.184
- Hello?
- Yes, honey. Make it quick.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.771
I got a live one tonight,
and I totally fucked up my face.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.858
<i>Aw. Oh, okay. Mickey Wolfmann,
what can you tell me?</i>

10:04.020 --> 10:06.523
Powerhouse in L.A. real estate.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.033
From the desert to the sea.

10:09.192 --> 10:12.662
Technically Jewish, but wants to be a Nazi.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.243
What's he to you?

10:14.405 --> 10:15.702
<i>Possible case.</i>

10:15.865 --> 10:19.085
<i>Let's say I wanted to hang out
and rap with this Wolfmann.</i>

10:19.953 --> 10:22.047
Say it's a really bad idea.

10:22.205 --> 10:26.506
He goes around with a dozen bikers,
mostly Aryan Brotherhood alumni.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.170
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.963
I flunked Social Studies...

10:30.130 --> 10:32.383
...but, uh, Jews and Aryan Brotherhood...

10:32.549 --> 10:34.301
...isn't there something about hatred?

10:34.467 --> 10:37.971
No. Mickey's eccentric.
More and more lately.

10:38.138 --> 10:42.814
I'd say, stoned out of his fucking mind
since he discovered drugs.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.070
No offense to you, Doc.

10:46.437 --> 10:50.067
So where would I, uh, find him?
Like accidentally?

10:50.275 --> 10:54.200
Try the Channel View Estates,
his latest insult to the environment.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.491
The one that Bigfoot Bjornsen
does the commercials for?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.500
- That's the one.
- Uh-huh.

10:59.659 --> 11:04.085
Maybe your old cop buddy's the one
who should be taking care of your case.

11:04.247 --> 11:07.717
Yeah, well, I did think
about going to Bigfoot with this...

11:07.876 --> 11:11.801
...but just as I reached for the phone,
history and all, I thought:

11:11.963 --> 11:13.215
Mm...

11:13.381 --> 11:16.931
- Well, maybe you're better off with the Nazis.
- Heh.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.094
All right, all right.

11:18.261 --> 11:22.266
<i>I got major liquid-liner issues.
I gotta get off now, Larry.</i>

11:22.432 --> 11:23.604
All right.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.106
<i>Morning, Sam.</i>

11:26.269 --> 11:27.896
<i>Hey, man.</i>

11:28.062 --> 11:29.814
<i>I don't want you paying rent.</i>

11:29.981 --> 11:32.860
<i>Rent's a hassle.
I wanna see you in your own pad...</i>

11:33.026 --> 11:34.278
Howdy, Bigfoot.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.071
<i>...at Channel View Estates...</i>

11:36.237 --> 11:39.662
<i>...Artesia's newest and grooviest
residential housing development.</i>

11:39.824 --> 11:41.792
<i>No buzzkill credit checks.</i>

11:41.951 --> 11:45.296
<i>No rip-off minimum down payments.
That's not your bag.</i>

11:45.455 --> 11:46.923
<i>But check this out:</i>

11:47.081 --> 11:51.382
<i>Fully-equipped kitchen with automatic
self-cleaning oven and breakfast nook.</i>

11:51.544 --> 11:52.921
<i>Out of sight.</i>

11:53.087 --> 11:56.387
<i>Attached one-car
and available two-car garage.</i>

11:56.549 --> 11:57.971
<i>And best of all...</i>

11:58.134 --> 12:00.557
<i>...a view of the Dominguez
Flood Control Channel...</i>

12:00.720 --> 12:03.394
<i>...that can only be described in two words:</i>

12:03.556 --> 12:05.058
<i>Right on.</i>

12:05.600 --> 12:08.069
So, what's all this now?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.075
<i>What's up, Doc?</i>

12:14.651 --> 12:16.119
What...?

12:18.780 --> 12:22.501
"Michael Wolfmann, one of Los Angeles's
most prominent real estate developers...

12:22.659 --> 12:24.627
...announced at a press conference...

12:24.786 --> 12:28.040
...he's proceeding with construction
of several housing developments...

12:28.206 --> 12:30.504
...the most immediate
to be Channel View Estates.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.214
- Hey, Doc.
- Howdy.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.846
Cop came around last night
looking for you again.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.348
- Bigfoot?
- Yeah. That's the one.

12:37.507 --> 12:38.850
Huh.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.682
I wonder why he didn't kick in my door
like usual.

12:41.844 --> 12:46.065
He might've been thinking about it, but said
something like, "Tomorrow's another day."

12:46.224 --> 12:47.976
Which would be today, right?

12:49.519 --> 12:51.942
Not if I can help it.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.947
All right, "Wolfmann,
known for his outlandish advertising...

12:56.109 --> 12:59.079
...and aggressive style, has been...

12:59.237 --> 13:01.990
...involved in the Southern
California real estate market..."

13:02.156 --> 13:05.035
...for the past 23 fucking years, you know.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.373
- Morning, Doc.
- Hey. Morning, Petunia.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.384
- I love your Afro. Uh-huh.
- Oh, yeah? Thank you.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.387
Oh, Doc. You have someone
waiting in your office.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.887
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.640
Hey, man. Sorry to, uh, keep you waiting.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.566
- Dr. Sportello?
- That's right. What it is, my brother.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.733
Peace. I'm Tariq Khalil.

13:35.898 --> 13:36.945
Cool.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.530
Sit down.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.534
What's up, man?
How can I help you today?

13:45.700 --> 13:50.376
There's this white boy I was in the joint with.
Aryan Brotherhood.

13:50.538 --> 13:54.543
We did some business, and, uh,
now we're both out and he still owes me.

13:54.709 --> 13:58.134
I can't tell you the details,
but it's a whole lot of money.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.424
Mm. How about his name?

14:00.590 --> 14:02.433
Glen Charlock.

14:02.592 --> 14:07.439
Mm-hm.
And, urn, you know where he's staying now?

14:07.597 --> 14:09.349
I know where he works.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.268
He's a bodyguard
for this builder named Wolfmann.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.989
If you don't mind my asking, Mr. Khalil,
how'd you hear about me?

14:24.155 --> 14:27.034
Sledge. Sledge Poteet.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.292
Wow.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.044
Blast from the past. Far out.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.580
Yeah.

14:31.746 --> 14:35.250
He said you helped him out
of a situation back in '67.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.339
First time I got shot at.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.550
If you don't mind an obvious question...

14:39.712 --> 14:42.591
...you, uh, know where
this Glen Charlock works.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.260
Why not, uh, just go over there
and look him up directly?

14:45.426 --> 14:49.306
Well, because Wolfmann likes to surround
himself with the Aryan Brotherhood.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.065
Day and night.

14:51.224 --> 14:56.196
And, see, outside of Glen,
I ain't never liked the company of Nazis.

14:56.354 --> 15:00.951
Mm-hm. So, uh, send some white guy
to get his head hammered?

15:01.109 --> 15:04.204
- More or less.
- Mm.

15:04.362 --> 15:07.366
Now when you were inside,
were you in a gang?

15:07.532 --> 15:09.660
The Black Guerrilla Family.

15:10.993 --> 15:15.624
And you say you did business with who now?
The Aryan Brotherhood?

15:15.790 --> 15:17.133
Listen...

15:17.291 --> 15:21.171
...we found we share some of the similar
opinions about the U.S. government.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.589
That's all.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.553
I can dig.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.811
There's something else?

15:28.970 --> 15:31.189
Matter of fact, there is.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.606
My old street gang. The Artesia Crips.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.520
See, when I came home from Chino...

15:37.687 --> 15:40.315
...I looked for them
and found it ain't just them gone...

15:40.481 --> 15:42.904
...but the whole damn turf itself.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.239
What do you mean "gone"?

15:44.402 --> 15:47.030
Man, I'm talking not there.

15:47.196 --> 15:50.621
Ground up into little pieces.
Seagulls picking all over it.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.626
Man, I thought I was tripping.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.914
Got in my car, I drove around,
came back, still gone.

15:56.247 --> 16:00.002
Nothing. Nobody.
Just a ghost town.

16:00.168 --> 16:04.218
With a big sign that said,
Corning to this site soon.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.884
- With a big-ass ugly picture of some houses.
- Mm-hm.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.553
- And guess who the builder is?
- Let me guess...

16:10.720 --> 16:12.688
Wolfmann again.

16:13.431 --> 16:17.061
Okay. Can you show me
up here on the map?

16:17.226 --> 16:21.072
<i>Long, sad history of L.A. land use.</i>

16:21.230 --> 16:24.359
Mexican families bounced out
of Chavez Ravine...

16:24.525 --> 16:26.653
...to build Dodger Stadium.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.665
American Indians swept out
of Bunker Hill for the Music Center.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.917
And now Tariq's neighborhood...

16:33.075 --> 16:36.670
...bulldozed aside for
Channel View Estates.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.356
Hello?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.118
Hi. I'm Jade.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.954
Welcome to Chick Planet Massage.

18:37.116 --> 18:41.087
Take note of today's Pussy Eater's Special,
which is good all day till closing time.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.213
- How much is it?
- Fourteen ninety-five.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.927
Well, not that 14.95 ain't
a totally groovy price...

18:48.085 --> 18:51.055
...but I'm trying to locate this guy
who works for Mr. Wolfmann.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.886
Oh, does he eat pussy?

18:53.049 --> 18:55.393
Fella named Glen Charlock?

18:55.551 --> 18:57.974
Oh, sure, Glen. He comes in here.
He eats pussy.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.607
Well, Glen and I were in Chino around
the same time. You seen him today?

19:01.766 --> 19:03.234
Are you a cop?

19:03.392 --> 19:04.689
Nope.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.605
The reason I ask is
if you were a cop...

19:07.772 --> 19:10.241
...you'd be entitled to a free preview
of our special.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.197
Well, how about a licensed Pl?

19:13.903 --> 19:15.655
Hey, Bambi!

19:19.575 --> 19:21.543
Oh, my...

19:23.079 --> 19:24.922
Oh, do...? Um...

19:25.081 --> 19:27.584
Where do we, um...?

19:30.753 --> 19:32.755
Not you, Bong Brain.

19:33.756 --> 19:37.477
See, I thought here, where it says
Pussy Eater's Special...

19:37.635 --> 19:39.763
...is what that means is...

19:51.691 --> 19:53.113
That's groovy.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.153
Congratulations, hippie scum.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.782
And welcome to a world of inconvenience.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.163
<i>Well, morning, Sam.</i>

20:39.321 --> 20:42.495
<i>Like a bad luck
planet in today's horoscope...</i>

20:42.658 --> 20:46.663
<i>Where's the old hippie-hating
mad dog himself in the flesh:</i>

20:46.829 --> 20:50.834
<i>Lieutenant Detective
Christian F. Bigfoot Bjornsen.</i>

20:51.000 --> 20:55.801
<i>SAG member, John Wayne walk,
flattop of Flintstone proportions...</i>

20:55.963 --> 21:01.265
<i>...and that little evil-shit twinkle in his
eye that says "civil rights violations."</i>

21:01.427 --> 21:03.100
What's up, Doc?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.696
How about your ex-girlfriend?

21:12.688 --> 21:14.690
Shasta...

21:14.857 --> 21:16.700
...Fay...

21:16.859 --> 21:18.031
...Hepworth.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.534
Shasta Fay Hepworth.

21:20.696 --> 21:25.372
She is a known intimate
of Glen's employer, Mickey Wolfmann.

21:26.202 --> 21:30.628
But do you think
that Glen and Shasta were...

21:36.170 --> 21:38.719
...F-U-C-K-I-N-G-ing?

21:39.423 --> 21:40.549
Fucking-ing?

21:42.718 --> 21:44.846
Is that why you killed him?

21:45.387 --> 21:48.391
- Bigfoot...
- How does it make you feel?

21:50.643 --> 21:52.520
Here you are still carrying the torch...

21:52.686 --> 21:55.565
...and there she is in the company
of all those Nazi lowlifes?

21:55.731 --> 21:58.359
Keep doing that, Bigfoot.
You're giving me a hard-on.

21:58.526 --> 22:02.576
Tough little wop monkey,
as my friend Fatso Judson always says.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.037
So while suspect, that's you...

22:06.200 --> 22:09.830
...is having alleged midday nap
so necessary to the hippie lifestyle...

22:10.496 --> 22:14.171
...some sort of incident occurs
in the vicinity of Channel View Estates.

22:14.333 --> 22:18.383
Firearms are discharged. When the dust settles,
we find one Glen Charlock deceased.

22:18.546 --> 22:23.347
But more compellingly for L.A.P.D. is the
man Charlock was supposed to be guarding.

22:23.509 --> 22:27.355
Michael Z. Wolfmann has vanished...

22:27.513 --> 22:30.437
...giving local law enforcement
less than 24 hours...

22:30.599 --> 22:34.274
...before the Feds call it a kidnapping
and come in to fuck everything up.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.859
So perhaps, Sportello,
you can help forestall this...

22:37.022 --> 22:39.775
...by providing the names
of the other members of your cult.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.407
Cult?

22:42.570 --> 22:45.039
No one would be stupid enough
to attempt this alone...

22:45.197 --> 22:47.950
...which suggests some kind
of Mansonoid conspiracy. Agree?

22:48.450 --> 22:49.793
No.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.296
Look, I've been referred to...

22:52.454 --> 22:55.628
<i>...more than one time by the L.A. Times...</i>

22:55.791 --> 22:58.715
...as a Renaissance detective. Okay?

22:58.878 --> 23:01.051
Which means I am many things.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.386
One thing I am not is stupid...

23:03.549 --> 23:08.271
...so purely out of noblesse oblige,
I extend this assumption to cover you as well.

23:08.429 --> 23:09.476
What the fuck?

23:09.638 --> 23:11.106
Hey, Saunch.

23:11.265 --> 23:12.767
What's up, Doc?

23:12.933 --> 23:14.651
You know you have no case here.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.904
So if you're gonna charge him, you better.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.655
Otherwise, you have to let him go.

23:18.814 --> 23:22.660
Remember who this is you're talking to.
That's Bigfoot Bjornsen. Renaissance cop.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.154
I know who he is.

23:25.988 --> 23:29.492
So, what's the beef here, exactly?

23:29.658 --> 23:34.835
It doesn't have much to do with your specialty,
which I understand is marine law?

23:34.997 --> 23:37.170
We got plenty of crime on the high seas.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.837
Okay, well, so far, we have murder.
And kidnapping.

23:41.003 --> 23:44.007
We can work in pirates
if it would make you more comfortable.

23:44.173 --> 23:45.641
Either way, it's high-profile.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.176
Yeah, but, um...

23:47.343 --> 23:51.598
...given your history of harassment with
my client, this'll never make it to trial.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.108
No, I think we could take this to trial...

23:54.266 --> 23:57.566
...but with our luck, you know,
the jury pool will be 99 percent...

23:57.728 --> 23:58.775
...hippie.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.361
Unless you change the venue
to, like, Orange County.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.321
Not as many hippies there, you know?

24:03.484 --> 24:04.861
Saunch, who you working for?

24:05.027 --> 24:08.907
Clients pay me for work, Doc.
Clients pay me for work, Doc.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.287
So?

24:12.868 --> 24:14.962
I've decided I'm gonna kick Mr. Sportello.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.964
You're gonna kick him?
Well, that's assault.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.922
I think it's police slang, Saunch.
It means “out me loose."

24:21.085 --> 24:23.338
I'll release the suspect
at the impound garage.

24:23.504 --> 24:24.801
Promise?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.893
I promise.

25:00.416 --> 25:03.496
<i>Apparently, a party of
civilians on some training exercise...</i>

25:03.627 --> 25:05.220
<i>...in anti-guerrilla warfare.</i>

25:05.379 --> 25:07.427
<i>They assumed that this construction site...</i>

25:07.589 --> 25:09.512
<i>...not yet open for occupancy...</i>

25:09.675 --> 25:12.269
<i>...was deserted enough
to provide a realistic setting...</i>

25:12.428 --> 25:16.899
<i>...for what we must assume
was only a harmless patriotic scenario.</i>

25:17.725 --> 25:22.026
<i>Tragically, however, live ammunition somehow
found its way into these war games...</i>

25:22.187 --> 25:26.613
<i>...and tonight, one ex-prison inmate lies
slain while prominent construction mogul...</i>

25:26.775 --> 25:28.095
<i>...Michael Wolfmann has vanished.</i>

25:29.445 --> 25:30.788
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.118
<i>Hey.</i>

25:32.281 --> 25:34.579
Listen, we, uh...

25:35.325 --> 25:38.420
We sent a police academy hotshot
over to the last known address...

25:38.579 --> 25:39.796
...of Shasta Fay Hepworth.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.457
Oh, fuck. No, not this.

25:41.623 --> 25:44.046
<i>Yeah, they got there, and it was, uh...</i>

25:45.627 --> 25:47.504
<i>- They looked in the window and...</i>
- What?

25:47.671 --> 25:48.888
What?

25:49.631 --> 25:52.680
<i>They tried to open the door,
and she's just, uh...</i>

25:53.594 --> 25:56.063
<i>They went in and, you know.</i>

25:58.140 --> 25:59.312
<i>Phew.</i>

25:59.475 --> 26:01.352
<i>You know, she's gone.</i>

26:05.856 --> 26:08.029
<i>Sportello, she's gone.</i>

26:10.360 --> 26:11.907
She's out there, man.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.574
<i>- Out there?</i>
- Yeah.

26:14.740 --> 26:15.992
<i>What does that mean?</i>

26:16.158 --> 26:19.958
She's disappeared, just like Mickey.
Maybe you'd think there was a connection.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.624
<i>- She's disappeared?</i>
- Yeah, she's gone, man. Baby.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.841
She's gone. She disappeared. What...?

26:28.045 --> 26:29.843
She went all groovy on us.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.552
You know, Bigfoot, man.

26:31.715 --> 26:35.345
Can we just try to be fucking professional?

26:35.511 --> 26:38.014
I mean, just pretend to be professional.

26:38.222 --> 26:39.690
Shasta Fay Hepworth. She's gone.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.145
<i>Fuck you.</i>

26:48.982 --> 26:53.203
<i>Doc could never figure out
what Shasta might've seen in him...</i>

26:53.362 --> 26:57.742
<i>...besides being just about the only doper
she knew who didn't use heroin...</i>

26:57.908 --> 27:01.003
<i>...freeing up a lot of
time for both of them.</i>

27:01.161 --> 27:05.758
<i>And it wasn't any clearer
about what had driven them apart either.</i>

27:05.916 --> 27:10.342
<i>They each gradually located
a different karmic thermal...</i>

27:10.504 --> 27:14.634
<i>...watching the other glide away
into different fates.</i>

27:15.259 --> 27:16.476
<i>Does it ever end?</i>

27:17.845 --> 27:19.188
<i>Of course it does.</i>

27:19.346 --> 27:20.814
<i>It did.</i>

27:39.366 --> 27:40.663
<i>Hello?</i>

27:41.410 --> 27:42.753
Hello?

27:42.911 --> 27:46.085
<i>- Mr. Sportello?</i>
- Mm-hm.

27:46.456 --> 27:49.005
<i>I got your number from the head shop.</i>

27:49.168 --> 27:51.546
<i>Down in Gordita Beach.</i>

27:51.712 --> 27:54.090
<i>I'm calling about my husband.
He was a...</i>

27:54.256 --> 27:56.509
<i>...close friend of a friend of yours.</i>

27:56.675 --> 27:58.552
<i>Shasta Fay Hepworth.</i>

27:59.761 --> 28:03.607
Uh-huh. And, um, your name is...?

28:03.765 --> 28:06.484
<i>- Hope Harlingen.</i>
- Mm-hm.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.779
And your husband is...?

28:08.937 --> 28:10.564
<i>Dead.</i>

28:12.357 --> 28:14.109
I'm sorry to hear that.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.278
- Do you want a cookie?
- I'm all right.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.743
So you never heard of him or his music?

28:18.906 --> 28:20.624
Mm...

28:20.782 --> 28:23.456
Inside the surf-sax category
he was this towering figure...

28:23.619 --> 28:25.542
...because he improvised once in a while.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.628
Instead of repeating the second
and third chorus note for note.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.004
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.

28:31.627 --> 28:35.598
Coy and I should've met cute,
but we actually met squalid.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.975
Down at Oscar's in San Ysidro.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.852
Oh, boy.

28:41.011 --> 28:44.185
I had just run into this bathroom stall
without checking first...

28:44.348 --> 28:48.649
...and I already had my finger
down my throat to vomit up...

28:48.810 --> 28:51.654
...this big balloon of dope
I had just scored...

28:52.564 --> 28:56.489
...and there Coy sat, gringo digestion,
about to take this giant shit.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.996
And we both let go at the same time...

29:00.155 --> 29:03.329
...and there's just vomit
and shit all over the place...

29:03.492 --> 29:04.994
...and with my head in his lap.

29:06.662 --> 29:10.417
And to complicate things,
he had this hard-on.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.009
Sure.

29:13.168 --> 29:15.296
One thing leads to another and...

29:15.462 --> 29:18.432
We pretty much started shooting up
together on a regular basis.

29:21.385 --> 29:24.013
Then along comes little Amethyst.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.853
I don't know
if you have the stomach for it, but...

29:31.520 --> 29:33.193
This is...

29:33.855 --> 29:35.528
...what we had her looking like.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.785
Everybody helpfully pointed out how...

29:37.943 --> 29:40.696
...the heroin was actually coming
through my breast milk...

29:43.240 --> 29:44.366
Mm-hm.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.661
...but who could afford formula, you know?

29:47.327 --> 29:49.455
It's a long way from
where we are now.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.749
Yeah, no, seems like
you're doing real good.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.383
I'm a drug counselor.

29:53.542 --> 29:54.714
- Sorry?
- A drug counselor.

29:54.876 --> 29:55.877
Uh-huh.

29:56.086 --> 29:59.556
Trying to talk kids into sensible drug use.

30:10.350 --> 30:13.069
- What do you think of my chompers?
- Hmm.

30:13.228 --> 30:14.696
You like them?

30:15.647 --> 30:18.526
No... I... Yes. Yeah.
No, I hadn't noticed.

30:19.318 --> 30:22.037
Heroin sucks the calcium out
of your body like a vampire.

30:22.195 --> 30:25.449
If you use it for any length of time,
your teeth just go all to hell.

30:26.575 --> 30:27.997
And that's the good part.

30:29.494 --> 30:33.419
So listen, this thing that happened
to your husband, how can I help you?

30:35.292 --> 30:38.546
Mr. Sportello,
I don't think Coy is really dead.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.637
Well, did you ID his body?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.097
No.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.354
Whoever it was that called...

30:47.512 --> 30:50.265
...just said that one
of his band members did that.

30:50.474 --> 30:52.727
What do you mean "whoever called"?
The police?

30:52.893 --> 30:55.772
I mean, it's, uh, supposed
to be next of kin.

30:59.983 --> 31:04.159
And then this deposit shows up.
Close to his disappearance.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.491
Interesting sum.

31:07.657 --> 31:11.378
Why would this big deposit
just suddenly appear in my account?

31:11.536 --> 31:13.959
I went to the bank.
I talked to the bank manager.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.466
He kept saying:
“You just lost your deposit slip."

31:16.625 --> 31:18.969
“You just lost your deposit slip."

31:19.127 --> 31:21.880
And I don't lose deposit slips this big.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.392
Do you have a picture of Coy
I could borrow?

31:25.550 --> 31:27.052
That, I do have.

31:29.679 --> 31:34.310
<i>These were perilous times,
astrologically speaking, for dopers...</i>

31:34.476 --> 31:37.650
<i>...especially those of high school age.</i>

31:37.854 --> 31:40.607
<i>Who'd been born, most of them,
under a 90-degree aspect...</i>

31:40.774 --> 31:43.493
<i>...the unluckiest angle possible...</i>

31:43.652 --> 31:46.451
<i>...between Neptune, the doper's planet...</i>

31:46.613 --> 31:50.334
<i>...and Uranus,
the planet of rude surprises.</i>

31:54.204 --> 31:56.002
<i>Doc had known it to happen...</i>

31:56.206 --> 31:59.676
<i>...that those left behind would refuse
to believe that people they loved...</i>

31:59.835 --> 32:02.839
<i>...or even took the same classes with,
were really dead.</i>

32:03.004 --> 32:08.135
<i>They came up with all kinds of alternate
stories so it wouldn't have to be true.</i>

32:11.263 --> 32:14.233
- Yeah.
- How did Coy and Shasta know each other?

32:15.183 --> 32:18.153
She picked us up hitchhiking once.

32:18.895 --> 32:22.616
I think Coy and her stayed in touch somehow.
I don't really know for sure.

32:26.695 --> 32:30.450
All right, well, uh, I'll call you
when I know something.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.049
Thank you.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.592
See you.

32:41.751 --> 32:44.755
<i>Shasta had mentioned
a possible laughing academy angle...</i>

32:44.921 --> 32:47.219
<i>...to Mickey Wolfmann's matrimonial drama.</i>

32:47.382 --> 32:49.885
<i>And Doc thought
it might be interesting to see...</i>

32:50.051 --> 32:53.681
<i>...how society-page superstar
Mrs. Sloane Wolfmann would react...</i>

32:53.847 --> 32:55.941
<i>...when somebody brought up the topic.</i>

32:56.099 --> 33:00.229
<i>If Mickey was currently being held against
his will in some private nuthouse...</i>

33:00.395 --> 33:03.774
<i>...then Doc's immediate chore would
be to try and find out which one.</i>

33:03.940 --> 33:05.317
Do you like the lighting?

33:05.484 --> 33:06.906
Uh-huh.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.284
Jimmy Wong Howe did it for us.
Years ago.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.161
Luz!

33:12.324 --> 33:15.544
The midday <i>refrescos</i> now,
if you wouldn't mind.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.667
Shall we sit?

33:18.830 --> 33:22.084
Now, your husband was planning
to endow a new wing for our facility.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.127
He actually tendered us a sum in advance.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.757
Somehow, it didn't seem right
to keep the money...

33:27.923 --> 33:30.051
...while little was known
of his whereabouts.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.094
So we'd like to refund you the sum.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.183
And if, and as we all pray...

33:34.346 --> 33:37.475
...when Mr. Wolfmann is heard from again,
why then, perhaps...

33:37.641 --> 33:40.440
...the process can resume again.

33:40.602 --> 33:42.604
We did recently endow another facility.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.148
In Ojai.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.608
- In Ojai?
- The Chryskylodon Institute.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.118
Kriskleddone?

33:48.276 --> 33:50.825
It's an ancient Indian word
that means "serenity."

33:50.987 --> 33:52.330
Ah, of course.

33:52.489 --> 33:54.457
Are you somehow a subsidiary?

33:54.616 --> 33:57.244
Perhaps one of our Sister Sanatoria?

33:57.994 --> 33:59.837
Mr. Riggs Warbling.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.627
My spiritual coach.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.884
- How do you do?
- Pleasurable.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.296
If you tell us where to send the
refund and what form you'd like it in...

34:07.462 --> 34:09.760
Small bills!
With nonconsecutive serial numbers.

34:09.922 --> 34:11.971
Riggs! Enough.

34:12.132 --> 34:15.137
He's always making these terrible jokes.
I'm so sorry.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.054
Perhaps if a company officer...

34:17.222 --> 34:20.146
...simply endorsed Michael's check
back to one of his accounts.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.733
Of course. Let us know the account number
and it's <i>as</i> good as in the mail.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.774
- Let me find you a deposit form.
- Wonderful.

34:31.695 --> 34:33.242
<i>So this is Riggs.</i>

34:33.405 --> 34:35.498
<i>The spiritual advisor.</i>

34:35.657 --> 34:36.873
<i>And there's Sloane.</i>

34:37.033 --> 34:40.663
<i>Maybe not so much English rose
as English daffodil.</i>

34:41.830 --> 34:44.674
<i>And this is L.A.P.D., busy as ever.</i>

34:44.873 --> 34:46.672
<i>Protecting and sewing.</i>

34:46.835 --> 34:50.681
<i>Getting in some last-minute free catering
before the Feds show up.</i>

34:50.839 --> 34:54.469
<i>And there's Luz,
the sexy Chicana housekeeper.</i>

34:54.634 --> 34:57.308
<i>Or pretending to be?</i>

34:58.847 --> 35:00.724
<i>Some kidnapping.</i>

35:00.890 --> 35:05.236
<i>Doc would bet an ounce of seedless Hawaiian
and throw in a pack of Zig-Zags...</i>

35:05.395 --> 35:09.116
<i>...that Sloane and old Riggs here
were fucking regularly.</i>

35:09.274 --> 35:12.323
<i>And that this was
the BF Shasta had mentioned.</i>

35:13.361 --> 35:15.705
<i>Did Shasta have a room of her own here?</i>

35:15.864 --> 35:18.538
<i>Or did they all just cozy up together?</i>

35:38.887 --> 35:40.730
Holy shit!

35:40.889 --> 35:42.311
I'm ticklish, babe.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.851
Oh, I like that.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.860
Keep looking.
I'm in there somewhere.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.271
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

35:47.437 --> 35:48.814
On, Vicky.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.358
Oh, Roxy.

35:51.524 --> 35:54.073
Carol, Sloane...

35:55.111 --> 35:56.658
Cute, huh?

35:56.821 --> 36:00.075
My tits aren't really that big,
but it's the thought that counts.

36:00.241 --> 36:03.495
Now, did, uh, all of you ladies
pose for these?

36:03.662 --> 36:07.041
A guy over in North Hollywood
does custom work.

36:07.832 --> 36:11.211
And what about that, uh,
girl that's gone missing?

36:11.378 --> 36:12.425
Shasta?

36:12.587 --> 36:15.090
- Yeah, she's in there someplace.
- Yeah?

36:16.007 --> 36:18.681
You know Mickey used to take me
in the shower to fuck?

36:18.843 --> 36:19.890
Oh, yeah?

36:20.053 --> 36:24.058
Uh-huh. And I never got to do anything
on that groovy bed in there.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.692
Luz!

36:27.977 --> 36:30.526
- Ah. Another time, perhaps?
- Mm-hm.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.075
Ooh. Black girl.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.955
Bigfoot.

37:01.511 --> 37:04.765
<i>Something had been
puzzling Doc now for a while.</i>

37:04.931 --> 37:09.482
<i>Namely, what, exactly, the fuck,
was with Bigfoot here?</i>

37:12.397 --> 37:14.741
<i>As much as he'd like to stay and chat...</i>

37:14.899 --> 37:17.573
<i>...he had a lunch date to keep
with part-time squeeze...</i>

37:17.736 --> 37:20.114
<i>...Deputy DA Penny Kimball.</i>

37:20.613 --> 37:24.993
<i>It was only because someone else had
canceled that she was able to pencil him in.</i>

37:25.160 --> 37:29.961
<i>And Doc didn't wanna fuck up her act,
considering they were meeting in public.</i>

37:31.458 --> 37:32.675
Hi.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.546
This Wolfmann-Charlock case...

37:35.712 --> 37:38.386
Apparently, one of your girlfriends
is a principal.

37:39.966 --> 37:42.094
I just heard that she skipped.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.933
Let me put it to you like this:

37:44.095 --> 37:47.099
How close were you
with Shasta Fay Hepworth?

37:47.265 --> 37:50.018
I've been asking myself that very question.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.028
It was all over years ago.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.530
- Months? I don't know.
- Years?

37:53.688 --> 37:56.441
If you hadn't come along,
who knows how bad it might've got?

37:56.608 --> 37:59.361
- True. You were a mess when I met you.
- And how about now?

37:59.527 --> 38:04.374
Old times aside, have you had any contact
with her in the last, say, week or so?

38:05.533 --> 38:07.456
Well, funny you should ask.

38:08.369 --> 38:11.589
She called me up a couple days ago
before Mickey Wolfmann disappeared.

38:11.748 --> 38:13.716
Told me how his wife and her boyfriend...

38:13.875 --> 38:17.049
...were plotting to hustle Mickey
and grab all his money.

38:17.212 --> 38:21.092
So I sure hope that you guys or the cops
or whoever are looking into that.

38:21.257 --> 38:25.057
With your years of experience as a Pl,
would you call that a reliable lead?

38:25.220 --> 38:26.767
I've known worse.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.482
Oh, I can dig.
You're just gonna ignore that?

38:29.641 --> 38:33.236
Some hippie chick with boyfriend trouble,
brains mushed up with dope and sex?

38:33.394 --> 38:35.021
I've never seen you so emotional.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.566
The lights are out.
Never seen you during the day.

38:37.732 --> 38:41.453
You didn't tell Bjornsen any of this
when he pulled you in at the crime scene.

38:41.611 --> 38:44.706
That's because I promised Shasta
I'd come talk to you first, right?

38:44.864 --> 38:48.164
See if anybody at the DA could help out
with this. I tried to call you.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.954
- Day and night. No reply.
- You tried to call me. Really?

38:51.120 --> 38:52.872
Yeah. Look, I forgot. I don't know.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.666
Look, all know is the next thing...

38:54.833 --> 38:58.838
...Shasta's missing, Wolfmann's gone
and, uh, Glen Charlock's dead.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.203
Bjornsen seems to think
you're <i>as</i> good a suspect as any.

39:02.549 --> 39:06.099
"Seems to"? Wait a minute.
You been talking to Bigfoot about me?

39:06.261 --> 39:08.059
Doc, please.

39:08.221 --> 39:11.441
Besides, maybe you did it.
Has that crossed your mind?

39:11.599 --> 39:13.567
- Maybe you just forgot?
- What? Did do what?

39:13.726 --> 39:14.943
Killed Glen Charlock.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.525
- Kill him?
- Yeah.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.780
What?

39:18.857 --> 39:20.700
How would I forget something like that?

39:20.859 --> 39:24.159
- Grass, and who knows what else.
- I'm only a light smoker.

39:24.320 --> 39:27.039
- How many joints have you had today?
- Check the logbook.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.620
Can't remember?

39:31.119 --> 39:36.376
I don't see how my smoking has any link
to the Wolfmann-Charlock-Shasta case.

39:36.541 --> 39:37.588
No?

39:37.750 --> 39:41.129
Then how come Miss Hepworth
dismantled your relationship?

39:41.296 --> 39:43.094
She had other fish to fry.

39:43.673 --> 39:46.643
- Would you say you're still in love with her?
- Mm.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.557
No.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.472
Take off your glasses.

39:52.599 --> 39:53.942
No.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.568
I'm not... Wait.
What is this?

39:55.727 --> 39:59.903
Hectic week ahead for me, so unless things
heat up dramatically, I hope you understand.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.782
Walk me back to work?

40:14.037 --> 40:16.415
I'm Agent Flatweed.
This is Agent Borderline. FBI.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.424
- I'm with...
- I have to use the bathroom.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.711
It's been brought to our attention...

40:20.877 --> 40:24.472
...you had a visit from a black prison
militant calling himself Tariq Khalil.

40:24.631 --> 40:26.224
We naturally became curious.

40:26.382 --> 40:28.510
Let's talk upstairs, Larry.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.861
Did I miss an episode?

40:39.020 --> 40:41.148
I love you guys every Sunday night, 8 p.m.

40:41.689 --> 40:45.535
We like investigating and spending energy
on Black Nationalist Hate Groups.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.947
It's the chronology, really.
Khalil visits your place of business.

40:49.113 --> 40:53.243
The next day, a known prison acquaintance
of his, Glen Charlock, is slain...

40:53.409 --> 40:57.004
...Michael Wolfmann disappears
and you get arrested on suspicion...

40:57.163 --> 40:59.211
...and, somewhat
mysteriously, let go again.

40:59.415 --> 41:02.168
Yeah. Well, have you talked
to Bigfoot Bjornsen about this?

41:02.335 --> 41:04.429
He's real intelligent
about this kind of shit.

41:04.587 --> 41:07.466
Mr. Bjornsen's antipathy
at the federal level is well known.

41:07.632 --> 41:10.511
Heh. Ah, some guys are like that.

41:10.677 --> 41:13.647
- Mm.
- So, what is it you want with me?

41:13.805 --> 41:16.399
Ordinarily, we're the ones
asking the questions here.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.356
Sure thing, fellas.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.363
But aren't we all in the same business?

41:22.522 --> 41:24.149
There's no need to be insulting.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.239
Why don't you just tell us
what Mr. Khalil had to say...

41:27.402 --> 41:29.154
...when he visited you the other day.

41:29.862 --> 41:33.366
Because he's privileged
and I'm a client is why.

41:33.533 --> 41:37.504
If it has a bearing on the
Wolfmann case, then we may have to disagree.

41:40.248 --> 41:43.502
Look, I really wish
I could help you guys out, but...

41:43.668 --> 41:46.387
...if you're so focused
on the Black Panthers...

41:46.546 --> 41:49.425
...then what's with your interest
in Mickey Wolfmann?

41:49.966 --> 41:54.437
Is somebody playing Monopoly, uh,
with federal housing money?

41:57.223 --> 42:01.854
Are you figuring Mickey's kidnapping
is a Black Panther operation?

42:02.020 --> 42:05.445
They put the snatch on Mickey,
trying to prove a political point...

42:05.606 --> 42:09.076
...or maybe a nice shot
at some ransom money?

42:10.611 --> 42:14.616
Maybe you've thought of putting that forward
as a cover story for whatever did happen.

42:14.782 --> 42:18.286
Do you realize how thoroughly
we can fuck your life up?

42:18.911 --> 42:20.128
Huh. Uh-huh.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.128
Right.

42:23.332 --> 42:24.754
Can I be frank a minute?

42:24.917 --> 42:27.045
- Why stop now?
- Please.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.634
All right. You be Dino.
You be the other guy.

42:29.797 --> 42:33.222
And tell Penny Davis, Jr.
What a lovely day we had. Thank you.

42:33.384 --> 42:38.515
As a COINTELPRO informant, you could
be making up to $300 a month, Larry.

42:38.681 --> 42:40.274
Just consider that.

42:40.433 --> 42:41.776
U.S. dollars?

42:41.934 --> 42:44.813
And we'll throw in a Book of Mormon.

42:44.979 --> 42:45.980
Free.

42:55.073 --> 42:58.077
<i>Doc, a mysterious,
young oriental cutie...</i>

42:58.242 --> 43:01.712
<i>...just dropped off</i> a <i>package for you
at the front desk.</i>

43:21.849 --> 43:23.066
<i>Well...</i>

43:23.726 --> 43:26.946
...it's dark and lonely work,
but somebody's gotta do it, right?

43:27.105 --> 43:29.949
<i>Heard they cut you loose.
Need to see you about something.</i>

43:30.108 --> 43:32.702
<i>I'm working weeknights
at Club Asiatique in San Pedro.</i>

43:32.860 --> 43:34.988
<i>Love and peace,</i> Jade.

43:35.863 --> 43:39.458
<i>P.S. Beware the Golden Fang!</i>

43:48.292 --> 43:50.966
I can't stay out here long.
This is Golden Fang territory.

43:51.129 --> 43:54.383
A girl don't necessarily wanna get
into difficulties with those folks.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.392
What is it?
A band?

43:56.592 --> 43:57.764
You wish.

43:57.927 --> 44:01.602
I just wanted to say how sorry I was.
I felt shitty about what I did.

44:01.764 --> 44:04.438
- Which was what again?
- I'm not a snitch.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.524
The cops said they'd drop charges
if we put you in the scene...

44:07.687 --> 44:09.860
...which they already knew you were.

44:10.022 --> 44:13.196
- I'm, like, so sorry, Larry.
- Call me Doc. It's cool, Jade.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.407
- That copper?
- Mm, Bigfoot?

44:15.570 --> 44:17.038
He's a warped sheet of plastic.

44:17.196 --> 44:20.746
Mm. So was it Bigfoot who put me
on the Buenos Noches Express...

44:20.908 --> 44:22.080
...or did he subcontract it?

44:22.869 --> 44:26.248
I missed all that, man. Last thing
I remember was eating Bambi's pussy...

44:26.414 --> 44:29.338
...and Puck Beaverton's tattoo,
like, it was pulsating.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.595
Puck...? What's a Puck Beaverton?

44:32.753 --> 44:36.678
He's a baldheaded asshole with a
swastika tattoo you don't wanna meet.

44:36.841 --> 44:40.846
We were so freaked with the BadAss Brigade
stomping in there, we didn't stick around.

44:41.679 --> 44:45.604
There's somebody who wants to talk to you.
He thinks you can help each other out.

44:45.766 --> 44:50.112
He's a new face. I'm not sure of his name,
but I know he's in some trouble.

44:53.274 --> 44:55.072
I would've come by your office, man...

44:55.234 --> 44:58.158
...but I thought
there might be unfriendly eyeballs.

44:58.321 --> 44:59.618
Hi.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.579
Well, is this safe enough for you out here?

45:02.742 --> 45:05.291
Let's light this
and pretend we came out to smoke.

45:05.453 --> 45:07.831
- All right.
- I'm supposed to be dead.

45:07.997 --> 45:10.045
There's also a rumor that you're not.

45:10.208 --> 45:14.179
That don't come as such great news.
Being dead is part of my job image.

45:14.337 --> 45:15.930
Like what I do.

45:16.547 --> 45:18.515
You working for these people at the club?

45:18.674 --> 45:21.769
I don't know. Maybe.
It's where I pick up my paycheck.

45:21.928 --> 45:23.225
Where are you staying?

45:23.387 --> 45:25.264
House in Topanga Canyon.

45:25.431 --> 45:27.525
Band I used to play for, The Boards.

45:27.683 --> 45:29.777
But none of them know it's me.

45:29.936 --> 45:31.859
How can they not know it's you?

45:32.021 --> 45:34.490
Even when I was alive,
they didn't know it was me.

45:34.649 --> 45:38.153
- The sax player. The session guy.
- Mm.

45:38.319 --> 45:41.323
Plus, over the years,
there's been a big turnover in personnel.

45:41.489 --> 45:43.457
Like, The Boards I played with...

45:43.616 --> 45:46.665
...most of them have gone off
and formed other bands.

45:46.827 --> 45:48.670
Only one or two of the old crew left...

45:48.829 --> 45:52.504
...and, luckily, they're suffering
from heavy Doper's Memory.

45:52.667 --> 45:53.964
Mm.

45:54.126 --> 45:57.346
Story is you came to grief
behind some bad smack.

45:57.505 --> 45:59.098
You still into that?

45:59.257 --> 46:00.474
No.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.347
No.

46:03.177 --> 46:05.145
I'm clean these days.

46:06.681 --> 46:10.106
I spent my time rehabilitating up in...

46:10.268 --> 46:11.645
- You know, I...
- It's okay.

46:11.811 --> 46:14.439
How can I talk about
what I don't hear?

46:14.605 --> 46:15.822
Yeah.

46:16.816 --> 46:18.568
The thing I wanted to see you about...

46:18.734 --> 46:20.953
...I was wondering
if you could check on people.

46:21.112 --> 46:24.116
A lady and a little girl.

46:24.282 --> 46:27.411
See if they're okay,
without bringing me into it.

46:27.576 --> 46:30.830
It's down in Torrance.
Just see if they're still living there.

46:30.997 --> 46:32.340
See what's in the driveway.

46:32.498 --> 46:36.048
Law enforcement in the picture,
any details you find interesting.

46:36.210 --> 46:37.883
All right, I'm on it.

46:41.257 --> 46:43.476
I can't pay you right now.

46:44.135 --> 46:45.182
When you can.

46:45.344 --> 46:47.563
Unless you believe information is money...

46:47.722 --> 46:50.896
...in which case,
I could ask you something.

46:51.058 --> 46:53.686
Bearing in mind that either I don't know...

46:53.853 --> 46:56.402
...or it's my ass if I tell you...

46:57.315 --> 46:58.532
...what is it?

46:58.691 --> 47:00.659
Ever heard of the Golden Fang?

47:00.818 --> 47:02.616
Sure. It's a boat.

47:02.778 --> 47:05.281
- A boat?
- A big schooner, somebody said.

47:05.448 --> 47:09.453
Brings stuff in and out of the country,
but no one wants to talk about it.

47:10.119 --> 47:11.496
Because?

47:13.581 --> 47:14.958
That was it.

47:16.417 --> 47:17.794
How do you know?

47:17.960 --> 47:21.089
Saw it sail in when I got here tonight.

47:22.298 --> 47:23.971
I don't know what I just saw.

47:24.133 --> 47:25.601
Me neither.

47:26.093 --> 47:29.267
Fact, I don't even wanna know.

47:32.183 --> 47:34.481
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Coy.

47:34.643 --> 47:37.567
<i>Doc figured it might
have been easier to let Coy know...</i>

47:37.730 --> 47:40.825
<i>...that Hope and little Amethyst
were doing just fine.</i>

47:40.983 --> 47:44.738
<i>But he had a rule against getting involved
in matrimonials...</i>

47:44.904 --> 47:47.157
<i>...which had just gone up in smoke...</i>

47:47.323 --> 47:50.668
<i>...like the Asian indica in the joint
they'd been smoking...</i>

47:50.826 --> 47:56.253
<i>...creating an extra layer of fog on top of
the one Doc was already standing inside of.</i>

47:56.415 --> 48:00.966
Meet the schooner <i>Golden</i> Fang,
out of Charlotte Amalie.

48:01.128 --> 48:03.551
- Where is that?
- U.S. Virgin Islands.

48:04.548 --> 48:07.427
- Bermuda Triangle?
- Close enough.

48:07.593 --> 48:09.516
Sizable vessel.

48:10.346 --> 48:13.566
She has a tendency to show up here
in the middle of the night...

48:13.724 --> 48:15.271
...no running lights...

48:15.434 --> 48:17.061
...no radio traffic.

48:17.228 --> 48:20.232
See, the problem with this vessel
is trying to find out anything.

48:20.398 --> 48:23.902
People back off, change the subject
and get real creepy.

48:24.985 --> 48:28.831
The owners are listed
as a consortium in the Bahamas.

48:31.659 --> 48:35.709
Her real name isn't really the <i>Golden Fang.</i>

48:35.871 --> 48:39.000
She was originally a fishing boat
named <i>Preserved.</i>

48:39.166 --> 48:41.919
Then after World War ll,
she was bought by Burke Stodger.

48:42.086 --> 48:46.307
Burke Stodger. Burke Stodger the actor?
.45-Caliber <i>Kissoff</i> Burke Stodger?

48:46.465 --> 48:47.842
The movie star.

48:49.677 --> 48:51.020
What?

48:56.183 --> 49:01.656
He gets blacklisted because of his politics
and branded a communist.

49:01.814 --> 49:04.192
So he takes the boat, splits the country...

49:04.358 --> 49:07.362
...which is where
your Bermuda Triangle comes in.

49:07.528 --> 49:10.452
Hi. I'm Chlorinda.
How can I help you?

49:10.865 --> 49:15.120
Uh, well, I'm gonna have
the house anchovy loaf to start...

49:15.286 --> 49:18.256
...and, um, the devil ray filet.

49:18.414 --> 49:20.758
Can I get that deep-fried in beer batter?

49:20.916 --> 49:24.011
It's your stomach.
What can I get for you, little buddy?

49:24.170 --> 49:28.266
Mm, I'll take the jellyfish teriyaki
croquettes and the eel Trovatore, please.

49:28.424 --> 49:31.143
Okay. And to drink, gentlemen?

49:31.302 --> 49:33.475
You'll wanna get fucked
up before this meal.

49:33.637 --> 49:34.684
That's for sure.

49:34.847 --> 49:37.316
I have some recommendations.
Maybe the, uh, Tequila Zombie.

49:37.475 --> 49:38.852
- Make it two.
- All right.

49:39.018 --> 49:40.395
Thank you.

49:42.605 --> 49:46.951
So Burke's blacklisted, takes the boat,
splits the country.

49:47.610 --> 49:50.989
Somewhere between San Pedro and Papeete,
the boat disappears...

49:51.155 --> 49:53.829
...till one day a couple years later...

49:53.991 --> 49:57.165
...the boat and the owner
suddenly reappear.

49:57.328 --> 49:58.420
- You dig?
- Mm-hm.

49:58.579 --> 50:01.924
The <i>Preserved</i> is in the opposite ocean,
off of Cuba...

50:02.666 --> 50:06.011
...and Burke Stodger on the front page
of the <i>Daily Variety...</i>

50:06.170 --> 50:09.891
...in an article reporting
his return to pictures...

50:10.049 --> 50:13.349
...in a major motion picture
called Commie Confidential.

50:13.719 --> 50:17.519
Whoa. So Burke's working again.

50:17.681 --> 50:20.230
And his politics have miraculously changed.

50:20.392 --> 50:21.439
And the ship?

50:22.186 --> 50:26.987
Man, they removed any traces of soul
that she once had.

50:27.149 --> 50:28.401
It's a horror story.

50:29.151 --> 50:32.200
Are you emotionally involved?
With the boat?

50:32.655 --> 50:35.033
She's not just a boat, Doc.

50:35.908 --> 50:38.036
She's much more than that.

50:39.703 --> 50:40.750
All right.

50:40.913 --> 50:44.383
Well, I know why I'm so interested.

50:45.251 --> 50:46.343
But why are you?

50:46.502 --> 50:49.802
A story I heard the other night,
something about a smuggling angle.

50:50.464 --> 50:52.387
And the story you heard...

50:52.550 --> 50:54.928
...did it happen to include
Mickey Wolfmann?

50:56.136 --> 50:58.639
Not so far. Why?

50:59.390 --> 51:02.109
According to scuttlebutt,
shortly before he disappeared...

51:02.268 --> 51:06.648
...Mickey Wolfmann was seen taking
the <i>Golden Fang</i> out for a three-hour tour.

51:06.814 --> 51:07.861
Or should I say:

51:08.023 --> 51:09.320
<i>A three-hour tour</i>

51:09.525 --> 51:12.745
And, uh, was he accompanied
by his lovely companion?

51:15.406 --> 51:16.828
Okay.

51:16.991 --> 51:19.085
- My fucking ex, old Shasta Fay?
- I know.

51:19.243 --> 51:23.669
I know who she is. But, Doc, I thought
you were done with all that sad bullshit.

51:23.831 --> 51:26.129
Listen, did everybody make it back okay?

51:26.292 --> 51:28.465
Nobody was pushed overboard,
nothing like that?

51:28.627 --> 51:33.428
Actually, the word I'm hearing is that Mickey
Wolfmann might not be as missing as we think.

51:33.591 --> 51:35.514
Like gone but not gone?

51:37.052 --> 51:39.771
Man, you're gonna love this.

51:41.765 --> 51:44.365
The rumor is that the Department
of Justice is trying to broker...

51:44.476 --> 51:46.604
- Uh-uh-uh.
- Here you go.

51:46.770 --> 51:47.896
Thank you.

51:50.733 --> 51:53.156
I'm hearing that the
Department of Justice...

51:53.319 --> 51:56.038
...is trying to broker
a Vegas deal for him.

51:56.196 --> 51:59.120
Doesn't compute. Say again.
Vegas. Wolfmann.

51:59.950 --> 52:01.668
FBI stuff.

52:01.827 --> 52:05.582
They need somebody else on the Strip
who's not Italian.

52:06.248 --> 52:07.295
You dig?

52:07.458 --> 52:10.462
Like Howard Hughes
when he bought the Desert Inn.

52:13.756 --> 52:14.973
Howard Hughes was Italian?

52:16.216 --> 52:19.060
No. They want white people.

52:19.261 --> 52:22.856
They want white, Anglo owners on the Strip.

52:23.474 --> 52:25.602
Who better than Mickey Wolfmann?

52:34.026 --> 52:35.243
Hello?

52:37.571 --> 52:38.743
Hello?

52:39.448 --> 52:41.166
All right, Doc.

52:41.325 --> 52:43.999
<i>So she just departed San Pedro
on board the Golden</i> Fang.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.505
- Who?
<i>- Your ex, Shasta Fay.</i>

52:46.664 --> 52:48.712
<i>Shasta's on the Golden Fang?</i>

52:48.874 --> 52:51.753
<i>My friend in the DOJ just called me, yeah.</i>

52:51.919 --> 52:55.093
- All right, where's it going?
<i>- Out at sea some place.</i>

52:55.339 --> 52:57.216
- Huh?
<i>- Out at sea some place and...</i>

52:57.383 --> 52:58.635
Yeah, where?

52:58.801 --> 53:01.475
<i>Not known. Not known.</i>

53:03.764 --> 53:06.017
<i>Hang tight. I'm gonna get back to you.</i>

53:06.183 --> 53:08.231
All right, cool. Call me...

53:52.896 --> 53:54.990
<i>Penny Kimball, Deputy DA.</i>

53:55.899 --> 53:57.116
Hey.

53:57.860 --> 53:59.157
<i>Who is this?</i>

53:59.903 --> 54:01.029
It's me.

54:01.196 --> 54:02.994
<i>Where did you get this number?</i>

54:03.490 --> 54:05.208
It's Doc.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.662
Oh.

54:08.620 --> 54:11.169
<i>I thought you'd never want
to speak to me again.</i>

54:11.999 --> 54:14.468
Mm. Didn't, uh...

54:14.626 --> 54:17.095
I didn't mind talking to the FBI.

54:17.254 --> 54:18.927
<i>Am I in trouble?</i>

54:20.132 --> 54:22.055
I don't know. Are you?

54:26.096 --> 54:29.691
It's an awful nice night
out here at the beach.

54:30.392 --> 54:31.939
<i>Hmm.</i>

54:33.145 --> 54:35.068
<i>But you're a dirty, filthy hippie.</i>

54:35.230 --> 54:38.029
<i>What would a nice clean girl
like me do with you?</i>

54:39.067 --> 54:41.286
Well, you could, uh...

54:41.445 --> 54:44.665
...bring your soap and clean my feet.

54:45.616 --> 54:47.243
Ew.

54:47.409 --> 54:48.956
<i>No, thank you.</i>

54:51.789 --> 54:54.417
<i>But then again, I could bring you a</i> pizza.

54:57.586 --> 54:59.213
<i>I can hear your pants growing.</i>

55:02.800 --> 55:04.052
So...?

55:04.676 --> 55:06.519
<i>I'll be there in an hour.</i>

55:06.678 --> 55:08.225
<i>And wash your feet first.</i>

55:08.388 --> 55:10.356
<i>...Problems for which government has...</i>

55:10.516 --> 55:11.642
Freedom.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.190
Heavy on the "dumb."

55:15.562 --> 55:18.402
<i>- -The moral and spiritual crisis in
the universities would still exist.</i>

55:18.524 --> 55:20.822
<i>The destructive activists
of our universities...</i>

55:20.984 --> 55:24.033
That's the best
thing I've heard all day.

55:26.031 --> 55:27.328
You want one?

55:27.491 --> 55:29.414
<i>Nixon downplayed the antiwar message...</i>

55:29.576 --> 55:31.203
<i>...inherent in the New
Year's bombers' attack.</i>

55:31.370 --> 55:35.125
<i>When he called on the vigilant California
to take back cities and universities...</i>

55:35.290 --> 55:37.167
<i>...he was interrupted by a heckler.</i>

55:37.334 --> 55:39.054
<i>Hey! Tricky Dick! Fuck you!</i>

55:39.127 --> 55:41.221
<i>You listen to me
when I say that to you!</i>

55:41.380 --> 55:44.429
<i>Fuck you! Fuck everybody in the family!</i>

55:45.217 --> 55:47.766
Now, what the fuck?

55:48.720 --> 55:51.849
<i>He's identified as unemployed
UCLA student Rick Doppel.</i>

55:52.015 --> 55:54.359
- Who?
- Oh, Doppler? That's no hippie.

55:54.518 --> 55:56.111
That's Chucky.

55:56.895 --> 55:58.442
Yeah? Is it a friend of yours?

55:58.605 --> 56:00.824
<i>Secret Service took
the man for questioning...</i>

56:00.983 --> 56:02.360
Everybody knows Chucky.

56:02.526 --> 56:06.201
If he's not at the Hall of Justice,
he's down at the Glass House.

56:07.155 --> 56:08.782
A snitch?

56:09.449 --> 56:11.326
An informant, please.

56:11.493 --> 56:13.916
And he only works with the Red Squad.

56:14.079 --> 56:20.303
Whoa. So, what's he...? Why is he screaming
and yelling like that at Nixon again?

56:21.712 --> 56:26.513
Now that he's been on TV,
he has instant and wide credibility.

56:26.675 --> 56:29.929
Police can infiltrate him
into any group they want to.

56:31.763 --> 56:33.606
Bastards.

56:36.768 --> 56:39.191
- Do you love me?
- Any group.

56:40.981 --> 56:42.449
<i>Hmm...</i>

56:42.608 --> 56:46.613
<i>A snitch. A spy. A weasel.</i>

56:46.778 --> 56:48.155
<i>And dang...</i>

56:48.322 --> 56:53.294
<i>...if it ain't a resurrected tenor sax player,
working undercover.</i>

56:53.452 --> 56:55.045
<i>But for who?</i>

56:55.203 --> 57:00.175
<i>These patriotic pals of President Nixon
called Vigilant California?</i>

57:00.334 --> 57:02.837
<i>Some other unseen hand?</i>

57:03.003 --> 57:04.926
Now, who am I again?

57:05.088 --> 57:06.965
You're the photographer.

57:07.132 --> 57:09.851
- And the name of the magazine is...?
<i>- Stone Turntable.</i>

57:10.010 --> 57:11.057
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

57:11.219 --> 57:14.940
<i>Coy's band, The Boards, were
currently renting a place in Topanga Canyon...</i>

57:15.098 --> 57:17.942
<i>...from a bass player turned
record company executive...</i>

57:18.101 --> 57:22.106
<i>...which trend watchers took as further
evidence of the end of Hollywood...</i>

57:22.272 --> 57:25.196
<i>...if not the world, as they had known it.</i>

57:26.026 --> 57:29.621
<i>Doc and Denis hadn't dropped acid
for years in this town...</i>

57:29.780 --> 57:34.160
<i>...without picking up
some kind of extrasensory chops.</i>

57:34.326 --> 57:37.626
<i>And truth was, since crossing
the doorsill of this place...</i>

57:37.788 --> 57:42.715
<i>...they couldn't help noticing
what you would call an atmosphere.</i>

57:44.086 --> 57:45.303
Thank you.

57:48.215 --> 57:49.683
Ooh.

57:49.841 --> 57:52.310
What are you doing here?

57:52.469 --> 57:55.268
I drove up with Bambi.
She heard Spotted Dick were here...

57:55.430 --> 57:57.933
...so I had to come along
and keep her out of trouble.

57:58.100 --> 58:01.024
She's possessed.
She's got Spotted Dick posters on the walls...

58:01.186 --> 58:04.315
...sheets and pillow cases,
T-shirts, souvenir roach clips.

58:04.481 --> 58:06.108
All right, she's keen on the Dick.

58:06.274 --> 58:09.073
It's 24 hours a day.
She's got Spotted Dick albums on stereo.

58:09.236 --> 58:10.328
Okay, yeah, now listen.

58:10.487 --> 58:13.787
I'm looking for that guy that I met
at Club Asiatique the other night.

58:13.949 --> 58:15.622
- He's here.
- Yeah? Where?

58:15.784 --> 58:18.333
- He's in the kitchen.
- The kitchen?

58:19.162 --> 58:21.836
Hey, before you leave.
Can I get a ride with you?

58:21.999 --> 58:24.422
- This place is freaking me out.
- Mm...

58:24.584 --> 58:25.836
Okay.

58:30.590 --> 58:34.060
Good evening, Larry Sportello,
Stone Turntable magazine.

58:34.219 --> 58:38.190
- Smedley, Spotted Dick, keyboards.
- Mm-hm.

58:40.851 --> 58:43.570
<i>Was it possible that at every gathering...</i>

58:43.729 --> 58:48.280
<i>Concert, peace rally,
love-in, be-in and freak-in...</i>

58:48.442 --> 58:50.820
<i>...here, up North, back East, wherever.</i>

58:50.986 --> 58:53.956
<i>...some dark crews had
been busy all along...</i>

58:54.114 --> 58:57.163
<i>...reclaiming the music,
the resistance to power...</i>

58:57.325 --> 59:00.249
<i>...the sexual desire
from epic to everyday...</i>

59:00.412 --> 59:05.384
<i>...all they could sweep up,
for the ancient forces of greed and fear.</i>

59:06.460 --> 59:09.384
<i>"Gee," he thought, "I don't know."</i>

59:10.422 --> 59:11.594
Hey.

59:12.299 --> 59:13.596
Hi.

59:19.598 --> 59:22.522
Hi there. Remember me, Larry Sportello?

59:22.684 --> 59:24.903
<i>Stone Turntable magazine?</i>

59:25.062 --> 59:28.737
You, um, asked me
to, uh, look into that, um...

59:29.608 --> 59:30.860
...vehicle.

59:31.026 --> 59:33.654
- What?
- The vehicle?

59:34.279 --> 59:38.159
Yeah, what was the make and model
that you looked at again?

59:38.325 --> 59:41.078
You were asking about that older type VW...

59:41.244 --> 59:43.997
...with the hearts and blue birds and...

59:44.164 --> 59:46.462
Any replacement parts?

59:46.625 --> 59:47.842
None I could see.

59:48.001 --> 59:50.220
What about street legal?

59:50.378 --> 59:52.472
Was it any hassles with registration?

59:52.631 --> 59:55.555
Didn't seem to be any...

59:56.468 --> 59:58.766
- You saw Hope?
- Yeah, for a minute.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.397
She's okay.

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:02.603
Looks like she's been staying clean too.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.018
How'd she do it?

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:07.688
I don't know.
She's, uh, back teaching is all she said.

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:10.653
You know, public health,
drug awareness, something like that.

01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:13.285
- Where?
- Where? I don't know.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.070
She didn't say.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.036
It doesn't matter.

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:22.169
No way I could ever go back to them.

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:25.672
All right, man.
Look, you can't go back to them?

01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:28.459
Who? Because what? Why?

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:31.344
Because it would be my ass
and my family's too.

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:35.929
It's like a gang.
It's like once you're in, you're in for life.

01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:37.764
Did you know that
when you signed up?

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:41.556
All I knew was we couldn't do each other
any good staying together.

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:44.270
The baby looked like shit,
getting worse every day.

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:48.187
We were just getting fucked up
and sitting there and saying:

01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:49.946
"Well, we gotta do something.

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:53.075
You're dragging us down, and..."

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:57.325
Listen, I'm not asking you
to give away any secrets here.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:01.458
But I think I saw you on the tube
at a rally for Nixon.

01:01:02.117 --> 01:01:05.166
And your question is,
Which side am I on?

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.625
Yes.

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:12.253
Well, you know,
these people here have money.

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:17.050
It's not like those Bible freaks that go up
and down the beach, like, screaming at you.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.513
They really wanna help.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:23.806
I thought it was something good to do
for my country.

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:25.349
Stupid as that sounds.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.438
But what I really found out was...

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:32.528
...they just wanna, like, use us
and keep the membership in line.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:35.909
"My country, right or wrong"
with Vietnam going on...

01:01:36.067 --> 01:01:38.286
...it's just fucking crazy.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:46.332
Suppose your mom was on smack.

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.539
My mom?

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.707
Yeah, what would you do?

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:54.219
- You know, wouldn't you try to help her?
- Yeah. I think...

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:58.428
Are you saying that the U.S.
is somebody's mom?

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.389
And she's, um, strung out?

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.430
- I'm trying to...
- On what?

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:08.601
On sending people off to die
in jungles for no reason.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:13.364
Something wrong and suicidal about that
that she can't stop.

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:14.568
Mm...

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:18.781
And Vigilant California, or whoever it is
you're working for, wouldn't buy that?

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:22.994
I don't belong here, man.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:26.330
I do get the feeling
you'd rather be someplace else.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:29.463
Yeah. Back where I was would be nice.

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.461
See, if I did just run a fast check...

01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:39.723
...and happened to find some angle
that you haven't thought of...

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:45.388
Listen, nothing personal, but there's
too much you haven't thought of.

01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:48.523
Man, I can dig.
You're trying to chase me off of this.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:52.186
Whatever it is that you're caught inside,
I'm out here on the outside of it.

01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:54.855
And I can, you know, move in ways
that you may not be able to.

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:57.945
Shh. How'd the baby look? Amethyst.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:00.281
Oh, man. A sweetie pie.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:01.660
- She looked good?
- Yeah.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.573
- No sign of them little kid blues?
- “Little kid blues"?

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:06.537
No, that happens.
They get that.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.202
Yeah. No, none I could see...

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:11.292
You saw it a little bit.
I blew this solo, man.

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.752
Listen, who set you up with these people?

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:15.713
Where did it come from?

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:19.550
I mean, come on. Gimme a glimpse here, man.
Who set you up with these people?

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:21.340
When I first started snitching...

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:25.386
...I realized how often people asked
questions they already know the answers to.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:27.896
They just wanna hear it from another voice.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.603
Like one outside their head.

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:33.564
You better find Shasta Fay.

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:37.572
Shasta Fay.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:17.987
Thanks for the lift, boys.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:20.649
See you around. Jade. Jade.

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:23.534
You said in your note,
“Beware of the <i>Golden Fang."</i>

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:26.572
Why am I supposed to beware of a boat?

01:04:32.494 --> 01:04:36.340
They're an lndochinese heroin cartel.

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:38.921
A vertical package.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:43.635
They grow it, bring it in, step on it,
run stateside networks of local street dealers...

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:47.267
...and take a separate percentage
off of each operation.

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.053
So you're dealing smack?

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:55.317
No, but they use Chick Planet
as a front to launder money.

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:57.689
See you around.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:04.075
<i>Reluctant, maybe even a little desperate...</i>

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.862
<i>...Doc figured
he had to go visit Bigfoot now.</i>

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:12.918
<i>On principle, he tried to spend as tittie
time around the Glass House as possible.</i>

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:17.707
<i>All this strange alternate cop history
and cop politics...</i>

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:21.502
<i>Cop dynasties, cop heroes and evildoers...</i>

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:24.512
<i>...saintly cops and psycho cops...</i>

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:29.017
<i>...cops too stupid to live
and cops too smart for their own good.</i>

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:32.600
<i>- -Insulated by secret loyalties
and codes of silence...</i>

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:35.436
<i>...from the world
they'd all been given to control.</i>

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.570
<i>Bigfoot's native element.
The air he breathed.</i>

01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:46.110
<i>The big time he'd been so crazy to get away
from the beach and be promoted into.</i>

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:51.031
<i>Then why so grumpy, Bigfoot?</i>

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:55.247
<i>Doc remembered dimly
a story from tong past.</i>

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:57.504
<i>A rumor about</i> a <i>partner of Bigfoot's...</i>

01:05:57.662 --> 01:06:01.212
<i>...who'd been shot and killed</i>
a <i>while back in the line of duty.</i>

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.877
<i>And ever since then,
the story went...</i>

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:06.341
<i>...Bigfoot had worked alone.</i>

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:12.056
I hope this won't be another one of those
unabridged paranoid hippie monologues...

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:14.220
...I seem obliged to sit through.

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:17.516
So, what if someone dies,
but is resurrected?

01:06:18.016 --> 01:06:20.565
Not, at first glance,
a matter for Homicide.

01:06:21.186 --> 01:06:23.359
So who around here handles resurrections?

01:06:24.022 --> 01:06:25.899
Bunco Squad, usually.

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:30.070
Does that mean the L.A.P.D. believes every, uh,
return from the dead is some kind of con?

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:33.080
You're dead, you're dead.
Are we talking philosophy?

01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:42.131
That there is Coy Harlingen,
the stiff in question.

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:44.543
That was taken last night.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.928
Remind me why I give a shit again?

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:53.100
He worked for the department
as a snitch...

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:57.890
...not to mention some patriotic badasses
known as Vigilant California.

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:04.191
They may have been in on the raid
at Channel View Estates.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:05.697
Remember that place, Bigfoot?

01:07:09.317 --> 01:07:10.614
All right.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:14.451
All right, I'll look into it personally.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:18.956
Sometimes,
it's just about doing the right thing.

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.821
Who are you?

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.827
Clancy Charlock.

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:56.494
Glen Charlock's sister, mother, sis...

01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:57.748
Sister.

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.786
“Saster." Ha, ha.

01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:05.173
I'm so sorry about your, um, brother.

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:07.084
Glen was a shit.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:10.129
Bound to have his series
canceled sometime.

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:13.424
That don't keep me from wanting
to know who his killer is.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:17.140
Goodness. Did you talk to the police?

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:20.522
They talked to me.
Some smart-ass named Bigfoot.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.901
He seemed less concerned with Glen's murder
than Mickey Wolfmann's disappearance.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:27.060
But he's a fan of yours all right.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.154
Said you might be able to help.

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:30.907
Did he now?

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:34.782
Did you hear the Wolfmann's working
on a way to give away all his money?

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.742
Why would he wanna do that?

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.707
He was on a guilt trip, man.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:42.163
Doing tons of acid and peyote and...

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.787
Just got to a point. He felt bad...

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:48.127
...about making people pay
for cheap houses.

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:53.595
Are you gonna keep holding on
to that tank or you gonna marry it?

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:01.145
He wanted to build this place
in the desert...

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:04.478
...where people could come and live for free,
called the Arrepentimiento.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.064
Uh-huh. Arrepentimiento.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:09.228
And now, what's that mean again?

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:11.193
Spanish for "sorry about that."

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:17.194
Uh-huh.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:30.546
Um...

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:32.836
Do you think that, um...

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:35.255
...you know, maybe your brother
was just, um...

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.970
...you know, doing his job
to try to prevent, um...

01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:40.760
...whoever it was
from putting the snatch on Mickey?

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.225
That's way too fucking sentimental.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:47.109
Sounds like somebody objected
to Mickey's big giveaway.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:48.776
Mm.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.858
The, uh, wife?

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.943
Business partners? Um...

01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:56.742
Puck Beaverton.

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:58.949
He had the duty
that day to guard Mickey.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:01.706
But changed shifts with Glen
at the last minute.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.868
Puck Beaverton.
Interesting fellow, I hear.

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.627
He's a major-league asshole.

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:08.038
Mm. Sounds like you dated.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.706
Him and his roommate.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:12.250
Two at a time?

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.086
That's my preference.

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:22.060
Well, you know where I might be able
to find this, uh, Puck fella?

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:25.813
Dropped out of sight after Glen's murder.

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:26.973
Set sail.

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:30.652
Heh. "Set sail"?
Like on a boat?

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.984
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Mm-hm.

01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:37.609
If you find him, you'll let me know?

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:43.995
Well, um, perhaps we should continue
this conversación someplace else.

01:10:50.288 --> 01:10:53.007
I've got a date.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.217
Thank you.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:00.597
Oh, and Miss Charlock.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:03.681
I just need your contact information
from you.

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:05.891
- Sure.
- Okay. Here's a pen.

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.186
Hey, Clance...

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:12.022
...did Glen ever mention
one of Mickey's ladies...

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:14.028
...who goes by the name of Shasta?

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:15.609
The girl who's gone missing?

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.195
- That's her.
- Yeah.

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:21.236
She was in love with him.
Deeply in love.

01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:24.781
Oh, Shasta and Doc lived together
for a short while.

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:27.455
Oh.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:28.952
Bummer.

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:33.210
Well, as someone who's been down
this particular exit ramp:

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:36.000
You can only cruise
the boulevards of regret so far.

01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:38.545
Then you gotta get back up
onto the freeway again.

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:39.883
Yeah.

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:42.052
Good luck.

01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:44.926
- See you.
- Bye now.

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:05.135
<i>I wish you could see these waves.</i>

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:14.600
<i>It's one more of these places a voice from
somewhere else tells you you have to be.</i>

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:23.274
<i>Remember that day with the Ouija board?</i>

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:27.491
<i>I miss those days...</i>

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:29.371
<i>...and I miss you.</i>

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:36.004
<i>Nothing was supposed
to happen this way, Doc.</i>

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.548
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.675
<i>You don't remember
the Ouija board, do you, Doc?</i>

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:49.134
<i>It had been one
of those prolonged times of no dope.</i>

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:54.977
You think it knows where we can score?

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:56.645
Ask.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.978
Just do it by yourself like that.

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:04.695
<i>Nobody had any. Everybody was
desperate and suffering lapses of judgment.</i>

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:08.737
Eight-4-2-9-3.

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:12.453
- It's a phone number!
- One-2-5-0-1.

01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:17.454
It's ringing.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.180
<i>Howdy, dopers. We've got whatever you need.</i>

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:23.835
<i>And remember: the sooner you get over here,
the more there 'll be left for you.</i>

01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:28.177
<i>So come on down to 4723 Sunset Boulevard.
You better hurry.</i>

01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:30.467
Okay, I'm sorry, who
is it that I'm talking to?

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:31.873
- She hung up.
- Let's go!

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:36.515
She's screaming at you:
“Stay away! I'm a police trap!"

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:40.644
Aw, there's a problem with Ouija boards.

01:15:01.372 --> 01:15:02.589
Shasta!

01:15:10.423 --> 01:15:13.097
<i>That board sure did its work.</i>

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:19.270
<i>They didn't score any dope that day,
but somehow, suddenly, it didn't matter.</i>

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:23.403
<i>It was weird that in the limited space
of a postcard...</i>

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:27.737
<i>...Shasta should have chosen
to remember that one day in the rain.</i>

01:15:27.898 --> 01:15:30.117
<i>It had stuck with Doc too...</i>

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:33.200
<i>...even though it was late
in their time together...</i>

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:36.662
<i>...when she was already
halfway out the door.</i>

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:08.322
Hey, Denis?

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:10.567
Denis, I'm-a go look around.

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.735
Wanna wait in the car
or come cover my back?

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:15.325
I was gonna try to go find a pizza.
Is that okay?

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:18.662
Now you recall this is stick shift,
not automatic and so forth?

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:20.497
It's easy as pie, Doc.

01:16:29.502 --> 01:16:31.129
Mm.

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:35.007
Good afternoon. Mm...

01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:38.678
This is the address they gave me
at Club Asiatique in San Pedro.

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:42.189
Just here to pick up a package
for the management.

01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:47.357
Hello, this is Xandra from front desk.

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:50.781
We have a pickup for management.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:56.282
Follow me.

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:10.676
Dr. Blatnoyd will see you in a moment.

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:35.660
So you have some ID, I imagine?

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:37.445
Mm-hm.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.839
I don't know what this is. What is it?

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:52.423
It's oriental or something. Is it Chinese?

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:57.215
Well, I figured, uh, you being Chinese...

01:17:58.632 --> 01:18:00.930
What? What are you talking about?

01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:05.398
The Golden Fang?

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:08.939
It's a syndicate.

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:12.063
Most of us happen to be dentists.

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:16.951
A syndicate of dentists
set up long ago for tax purposes.

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:18.611
All legit.

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:27.792
Where did you tell Xandra
you were from again?

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:30.381
Uh...

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.672
Oh...

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:38.385
Why, you're another one
of those hippie dope fiends, aren't you?

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:42.301
My goodness.
My goodness me.

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:45.096
Here for a little perking up, are we?

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:48.732
Dig it.

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:52.107
It's from Darmstadt.

01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:53.316
Lab quality.

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:56.153
I try not to do any dope
I can't pay for, is what it is.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:19:02.288
No, no, on the house! In fact, maybe I'm
gonna even join you for one little moment.

01:19:09.036 --> 01:19:10.583
Well, just to be sociable.

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:11.793
There you go.

01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:17.337
Doctor, I think there's a problem
with the couch in your office.

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:19.597
And bring that bottle.

01:19:57.501 --> 01:19:59.503
<i>What do you think of my chompers?</i>

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:04.433
Heroin sucks the calcium
out of your body like a vampire.

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:07.640
If you use it for any length of time,
your teeth go all to hell.

01:20:11.015 --> 01:20:12.892
And that's just the good part.

01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:19.444
Doc!

01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:23.698
Doc?

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:28.332
Dr. Rudy, I'm back.

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:31.043
You're not Dr. Rudy.

01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:33.412
You're not Dr. Rudy.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:38.083
That's at Japonica, ain't it?

01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:40.586
Japonica Fenway?

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:43.013
Imagine meeting you here.

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:46.597
<i>Doc rooted through the city dump
that was his memory...</i>

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:51.060
<i>...recalling that Japonica here had been a
pretty open-and-shut runaway daughter case.</i>

01:20:51.555 --> 01:20:53.102
<i>Hardly worth daily scale...</i>

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:56.565
<i>...let alone the extravagant bonus
her father, Crocker Fenway...</i>

01:20:56.727 --> 01:21:01.949
<i>...had insisted on paying when Doc
finally brought Japonica back home.</i>

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:03.734
So, what have you been up to?

01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:06.154
Escaping, mostly.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.573
And I escape real good.

01:21:08.739 --> 01:21:10.286
Escaping what?

01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:15.543
Chryskylodon. This, like, booby hatch
my parents keep sending me to.

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.081
"Booby hatch"?

01:21:17.247 --> 01:21:19.215
- Up in Ojai?
- You know it?

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.298
Shakes a tambourine.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.470
- Ooh.
- Aah!

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:25.552
Dr. Rudy!

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.637
Okay. All right.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.850
Japonica, you promised me.
Did you not promise me?

01:21:32.012 --> 01:21:34.092
- What are you doing here?
- I escaped again for you.

01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:37.359
Oof! Woo-hoo!

01:21:37.518 --> 01:21:41.022
Look at the greedy little hippie.
Snorting away, are you?

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:42.861
- Your parents know you're here?
- No.

01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:46.243
<i>The Fenways?
They were heavy-duty South Bay money...</i>

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:50.532
<i>...and led lives of unusually high density
and often incoherence.</i>

01:21:50.697 --> 01:21:54.702
<i>Her father, Crocker, also known
as the Dark Prince of Palos Verdes...</i>

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:57.712
<i>...was a lead lawyer at the office
of Voorhees-Krueger...</i>

01:21:57.871 --> 01:22:00.670
<i>...who had given Doc
his first paying gig as a PI.</i>

01:22:02.126 --> 01:22:03.844
Man, like, I'm sorry.

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:06.596
Denis, what is it this time?
That's my steering wheel?

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:09.804
- I don't know how to drive.
- Aw, man, I thought you said you...

01:22:09.967 --> 01:22:11.514
Hey.

01:22:11.677 --> 01:22:13.304
Smile Maintenance Chick.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:14.596
How lovely.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:17.516
Miss Fenway may appear
a little psychotic today.

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:18.771
Groovy.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:22.025
- What?
- It's groovy being insane, man.

01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:23.481
Where you at?

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:25.570
It's not groovy to be insane.

01:22:25.732 --> 01:22:28.030
Japonica here
has been institutionalized for it.

01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:31.865
Okay, come on now, Denis. We've gotta
figure out a way back to the beach.

01:22:32.072 --> 01:22:33.915
If you need a ride,
I'm heading that way.

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:35.500
Huh? Uh...

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:37.912
Cop friendly, everything
cool with your ride?

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:40.046
Brake lights, license plate, so forth?

01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:41.502
A-okay.

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:45.465
Mind if I tag along with you guys?
Contingencies of the road and so forth?

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:48.722
That's a good idea. Maybe we should
do more of that, tsk, tsk, for the road?

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:51.134
Yes. Yeah. You want some?

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.677
Excuse me.

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:53.890
Come on.

01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:02.228
What's in that bag
you're stuffing under Doc's seat?

01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:06.740
Pay no attention to that bag.
It'll only make everybody paranoid.

01:23:07.608 --> 01:23:09.610
<i>Though he may have rescued Japonica...</i>

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:13.201
<i>...from a life of dark
and unspecified hippie horror...</i>

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:16.082
<i>...apparently restoration
to the bosom of her family...</i>

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.619
<i>...had been enough
to really drive her around the bend.</i>

01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:22.506
Oh, fuck!

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.587
- Fucking assholes!
- Easy, easy.

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:27.094
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I can't...

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:30.176
- Okay, we are so fucked! I got...
- Nice and easy.

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:32.307
Christ, Christ. Some...

01:23:33.926 --> 01:23:35.303
Are you the Great Beast?

01:23:35.469 --> 01:23:37.016
No, no, that's a policeman.

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.219
You were driving without your headlights.

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:41.225
But I can see in the dark.

01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:43.519
Perhaps you shouldn't be driving, then.

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:46.780
- I'm gonna need to see all your IDs.
- What is this all about, sir?

01:23:46.939 --> 01:23:50.284
Any gathering of three or more civilians
is considered a possible cult.

01:23:50.484 --> 01:23:52.828
What? It's Charlie Manson again?

01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:56.661
Criteria includes reference
to the Book of Revelation...

01:23:56.823 --> 01:23:58.746
...males with shoulder-length hair...

01:23:58.909 --> 01:24:01.628
...and endangerment
through inattentive driving...

01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:03.460
...all of which has been exhibited.

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:06.250
- Oh, I don't think so.
- Man, listen.

01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:09.590
This is a Mercedes.
It's only painted one color.

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:12.222
- Y'all hang tight.
- That should count for something.

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:13.941
- Good point.
- Okay. All right.

01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:20.143
Okay, okay. Oh, God, I'm actually
gonna have a heart attack.

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:22.307
Actually my heart is
racing like a little...

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:25.360
- What?
- Yes, sir?

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:26.987
I'm gonna hand these in...

01:24:27.145 --> 01:24:29.773
...and as long as there aren't
any wants or warrants...

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.910
...you won't hear any more about this.
- Thank you, officer.

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:35.321
- Thank you, sir.
- Drive safely.

01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:38.536
- Here you go, Blat. Dr. Rudy.
- No, that's yours.

01:24:38.699 --> 01:24:40.576
- And Japonica here.
- That's beautiful.

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:42.665
Denis, take this.

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:44.375
This one is Denis's.

01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:01.471
Idiots Unlimited.

01:25:01.638 --> 01:25:04.642
Oh, yeah, I'm in an evil
mood myself tonight.

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:06.526
<i>What can I do?</i>

01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:10.030
Dr. Rudy Blatnoyd, DDS...

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:14.117
...has perpetrated his last root canal,
I'm afraid.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:17.662
<i>Hablo inglés,</i> man.
What's that...? He's dead?

01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:20.700
They found him
next to a trampoline in Bel Air...

01:25:20.866 --> 01:25:22.868
...with a fatal neck injury.

01:25:23.035 --> 01:25:27.506
So far no witnesses, no motives,
no suspects...

01:25:27.664 --> 01:25:28.711
...apart from you.

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:32.211
Mm, not me. Why me?

01:25:32.419 --> 01:25:34.513
You were observed in Blatnoyd's company.

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:37.845
Both of you riding in a vehicle
full of drug-crazed hippies.

01:25:38.008 --> 01:25:39.976
<i>Yeah, well, you know...</i>

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:41.933
...the owner of that vehicle...

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:47.192
...is a very well-respected, um, you know,
lawyer down in Palos Verdes.

01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:49.979
And his daughter was driving.
She offered me a ride.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:52.239
And cops didn't even give her a ticket.

01:25:52.439 --> 01:25:55.067
<i>You know, Blatnoyd
was her friend, not mine.</i>

01:25:55.233 --> 01:25:56.234
Go to bed.

01:25:56.443 --> 01:25:58.787
I'm working.
Why am I gonna go to bed?

01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:03.951
I think it's time we had one of our chats.

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:05.460
Uh...

01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:08.418
All right. Yup.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:15.629
So with this Coy Harlingen matter...

01:26:16.922 --> 01:26:19.050
...on the face of it...

01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:22.390
...it's one more OD,
one less junkie, case cleared.

01:26:22.552 --> 01:26:24.771
And on the not face of it?

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:29.021
Why, what do we have here?

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:32.230
Why don't you pick a card?

01:26:32.396 --> 01:26:33.943
Any card.

01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:36.609
These are field interrogation reports.

01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:39.073
See if you find anything
that looks familiar.

01:26:39.236 --> 01:26:41.113
Card tricks.

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:43.457
No.

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.117
Mm.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:48.249
Puck Beaverton.

01:26:48.412 --> 01:26:50.881
Excellent choice.
One of Mickey Wolfmann's bodyguards.

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:53.459
Interesting fellow, I hear.

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:56.011
Sheriff's people ran into him
at the Venice home...

01:26:56.169 --> 01:26:59.093
...of the dealer that sold Harlingen
the smack that killed him.

01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:00.633
Or didn't kill him.

01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:04.099
Wait, so, what was Puck doing
at Coy's dealer's place?

01:27:04.261 --> 01:27:07.310
The interesting thing
about this overdose...

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:10.692
...is that Leonard James Loosemeat
a.k.a. El Drano...

01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:13.070
...was known for this 3 percent product...

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:16.607
...yet the report says what killed him
was pure China White Number Four.

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:20.152
Like, from the whole-seller?
Whoever's bringing it in?

01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:24.073
I seem to recall that some years ago,
just before he went into Folsom...

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:28.085
...Beaverton used to work
for this loan shark...

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:30.295
...Adrian Prussia.

01:27:30.454 --> 01:27:32.627
Fucking zoinks! I know Adrian Prussia.

01:27:34.124 --> 01:27:35.876
I know him from my skip-tracing days.

01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:39.637
He's a bad man. Used a baseball bat.
You know, he's sick.

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:42.511
And Coy's dealer, El Drano...

01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:45.678
...also happened
to be Prussia's steady customer.

01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:50.266
So maybe Puck was there on Adrian's behalf.

01:27:51.808 --> 01:27:53.276
What do you think?

01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:00.325
I think you and Adrian have a history
you're not sharing with me.

01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:08.496
Got it, lieutenant!

01:28:09.826 --> 01:28:11.999
You got it, lieutenant.

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:20.463
Pancakes aren't quite as good as my mother's,
but what I really go for here is the respect.

01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:21.972
Respect.

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:24.553
You didn't get enough of that
from your mom.

01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:30.723
You probably imagine that I have a lot
of status up in Robbery-Homicide.

01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:33.517
I mean, who could blame you
for thinking that.

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:37.358
The reality, however...

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:42.075
...no Cielo Drive for Bigfoot.

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:46.413
No TV movie rights
or book deals for Bigfoot.

01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:52.831
I mean, even the extra work is drying up.

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.920
God help us all.

01:28:58.458 --> 01:29:00.927
Dentists on trampolines.

01:29:02.254 --> 01:29:05.724
You know, Dr. Blatnoyd
had puncture wounds on his throat...

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:08.931
...consistent with bites
from canines of a midsize wild animal.

01:29:09.094 --> 01:29:11.096
That's what the coroner told me!

01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:12.765
Swallow that!

01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:15.192
Listen, that's mighty weird, Bigfoot.

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:18.320
Okay? Because Blatnoyd
was a partner in a tax dodge...

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:21.903
...that calls itself
The Golden Fang Enterprises.

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:26.157
You didn't happen to get the, uh, SID to test
those neck punctures for gold or nothing?

01:29:26.319 --> 01:29:28.492
I shouldn't think there'd be much trace.

01:29:28.655 --> 01:29:32.956
Gold is all but chemically inactive,
as you might have learned in chemistry class...

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:36.292
...if you hadn't been ditching all the time
to score dope, Sportello.

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:39.500
Every contact leaves traces.

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:41.839
It would sure be ironic,
is all I'm saying...

01:29:42.002 --> 01:29:44.972
...if Blatnoyd was bit to death
by a golden fang...

01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:47.758
...or, like, even better,
like, two golden fangs?

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:50.393
I don't see why any of this
would be material.

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:52.225
Because it's the Golden Fang.

01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:55.982
- It's the decedent's tax shelter. So, what?
- No, man, it's not a tax shelter.

01:29:56.141 --> 01:30:01.113
It's something,
Bigfoot, man, much more, more vast.

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:06.242
This wouldn't be just more
of your paranoid hippie bullshit, would it?

01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:09.200
Look, have the lab check
for traces of copper.

01:30:09.362 --> 01:30:13.117
Not the kind that goes stumbling all over
the crime scene contaminating evidence.

01:30:13.283 --> 01:30:14.535
More like copper the metal.

01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:17.124
You see, gold teeth are never made
with pure gold.

01:30:17.287 --> 01:30:19.039
Dentists like to alloy it with copper.

01:30:19.205 --> 01:30:23.676
If you hadn't ditched forensics class to go steal
hubcaps to plant on some innocent hippie...

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:25.633
...you might have known that.

01:30:27.714 --> 01:30:30.433
Oh, you feel like a cop almost, don't you?

01:30:34.638 --> 01:30:36.015
Good day.

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:48.156
Okay, it's coming!

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:50.912
So where to?

01:30:51.071 --> 01:30:54.291
A place up in Ojai called Chryskylodon.

01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:55.951
Chryskylodon?

01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:57.960
"Animal tooth."

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:02.875
Ancient Indian word, Sortilège?
It means "serenity."

01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:06.921
I minored in the Classics.
It's not Indian, it's Ancient Greek.

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:10.557
It means "animal tooth made out of gold."

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:17.848
You're doing good, Doc.

01:31:20.892 --> 01:31:23.190
- Thanks, Lège.
- Okay.

01:31:25.355 --> 01:31:29.861
<i>Owing to Governor Reagan's shutdown
of most of the state mental facilities...</i>

01:31:30.026 --> 01:31:34.202
<i>...the private sector had been given
carte blanche to pick up the stack.</i>

01:31:34.364 --> 01:31:38.710
<i>Soon, in fact, becoming a standard
California child-rearing resource...</i>

- Mr. Sportello.
- Mm.

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:46.047
- Dr. Aubrey Threeply.
- Oh, how do you do?

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:48.052
- So good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:50.339
- Welcome. Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:54.180
Would you...? Sorry.
Would you like to use the facilities?

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:57.892
You already used the bathroom?
Before we take a tour of the facility?

01:31:58.054 --> 01:31:59.772
This is my colleague Dr. Lily Hammer.

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:01.604
- Mr. Sportello.
- How do you do?

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:02.858
Thank you.

01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:04.486
Please join us.

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:08.114
This is our administrative lounge.

01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:11.072
Our Chenin blanc comes

Hands steady as a rock today I see,
Kimberly.

01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:17.957
So happy you noticed, Dr. Threeply.

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:20.619
- More soup?
- Yes, if you know what's good for you.

01:32:20.827 --> 01:32:24.923
Have you been with us before, Mr. Sportello?
I know I've seen your face.

01:32:25.081 --> 01:32:28.927
Mm. First time I've been down here.
Normally, I don't get much south of South City.

01:32:29.085 --> 01:32:31.179
And abnormally?

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:32.927
What?

01:32:33.089 --> 01:32:37.060
Well, I only meant that with any number
of qualified facilities in the Bay Area...

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:39.892
...why even bother coming
all the way down here to us?

01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:42.729
Mm...

01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:46.486
My clients believe
that Ojai is a planetary chakra.

01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:58.157
Chryskylodon's motion picture palace.

01:32:58.323 --> 01:33:00.496
Now showing the Burke Stodger marathon.

01:33:00.658 --> 01:33:04.504
All Burke, all day, 24 hours of Stodger.

01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:06.832
<i>...people's museum.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:08.170
<i>This place is a lie.</i>

01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:10.961

Alexander Graham Bell!</i>

01:33:22.055 --> 01:33:23.272
<i>And he was an American!</i>

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:25.104
<i>Get that, comrade.</i>

01:33:26.059 --> 01:33:28.482
<i>Everything on this table is as phony
as the town.</i>

01:33:28.645 --> 01:33:30.739
<i>The rotten system you call communism.</i>

01:33:33.942 --> 01:33:35.615
<i>It was occurring to Doc now...</i>

01:33:35.777 --> 01:33:39.953
<i>...something Jade said once
about vertical integration...</i>

01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:43.619
<i>...that if the Golden Fang
can get its customers strung out...</i>

01:33:43.785 --> 01:33:47.039
<i>...why not turn around
and sell them</i> a <i>program to help kick?</i>

01:33:47.205 --> 01:33:48.752
<i>Get them coming and going.</i>

01:33:48.915 --> 01:33:50.883
<i>Twice as much revenue.</i>

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:54.967
<i>As long as American life
was something to be escaped from...</i>

01:33:55.130 --> 01:34:00.227
<i>...the cartel could always be sure
of a bottomless pool of new customers.</i>

01:34:31.708 --> 01:34:33.335
Any questions?

01:34:35.628 --> 01:34:38.347
Is that a swastika on that man's face?

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:40.759
Um, no, it isn't.

01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:45.271
That's an ancient Hindu symbol
meaning "All is well."

01:34:45.722 --> 01:34:50.148
- It brings good fortune, luck and well-being.
- Oh.

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:52.608
What do you mean?

01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:55.653
Only that it looked like a swastika to me.

01:34:55.815 --> 01:34:58.989
Well, he isn't a regular employee
of the Institute.

01:35:02.488 --> 01:35:05.492
Perhaps you should pay no attention
to that man.

01:35:16.836 --> 01:35:19.214
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.300
...encapsulated in the charming phrase:

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:25.057
Which means, of course,
"You must be very tired."

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:29.976
Which brings us to the institute's
own Zen garden imported from Kyoto.

01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:33.862
But each textured pebble,
each grain of white sand...

01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:37.069
...was transported and reassembled here
exactly in place...

01:35:37.232 --> 01:35:39.906
...by a team of some
of our more obsessive patients.

01:36:30.702 --> 01:36:32.045
Mickey.

01:36:33.997 --> 01:36:36.375
Mickey.

01:36:39.585 --> 01:36:40.757
Mickey.

01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:48.052
Hello, little hippie.

01:36:49.095 --> 01:36:50.142
How are you?

01:36:51.889 --> 01:36:53.436
Uh...

01:36:53.766 --> 01:36:55.393
What are you doing here?

01:36:58.313 --> 01:37:00.156
They're helping me.

01:37:01.399 --> 01:37:05.779
They're helping me wake up
from my bad hippie dream.

01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:08.748
Well, what'd you dream about?

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.500
I dreamed I gave away all my money.

01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:20.464
Yeah.

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:25.177
Who brought you here?

01:37:28.301 --> 01:37:30.099
My friends.

01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:36.685
Who are your friends? The FBI?

01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:42.899
I spent my whole life...

01:37:44.734 --> 01:37:48.204
I spent my whole life
making people pay for shelter.

01:37:48.363 --> 01:37:51.617
And all along, I didn't realize...

01:37:54.911 --> 01:37:58.666
I didn't realize
it was supposed to be for free.

01:37:59.999 --> 01:38:01.592
For free.

01:38:05.129 --> 01:38:06.631
Where's Shasta?

01:38:15.348 --> 01:38:18.192
What? Tell me, did she come with you?

01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:20.236
Is she here?

01:38:24.315 --> 01:38:26.317
Mickey, where the fuck is Shasta?

01:38:27.735 --> 01:38:29.658
Go away, little hippie.

01:38:33.658 --> 01:38:35.160
Go away.

01:38:36.994 --> 01:38:41.340
<i>"A new casino, a hotel,
25,000 square feet...</i>

01:38:42.959 --> 01:38:46.054
<i>...nine dining places,
race and sport booking...</i>

01:38:46.212 --> 01:38:49.307
<i>...shopping, a spa, local swimming pools...</i>

01:38:49.465 --> 01:38:51.263
...and a wedding chapel.

01:38:52.635 --> 01:38:56.139
Wolfmann hopes to attract
many Hollywood celebrities."

01:39:02.061 --> 01:39:04.109
1-Adam-12, handle code 3.

01:39:25.001 --> 01:39:28.050
<i>We don't have much to go on.
Just the broadcast Barrett put out.</i>

01:39:28.212 --> 01:39:31.136
<i>He was ambushed by two male Negroes,
possibly on foot.</i>

01:39:31.299 --> 01:39:34.143
<i>He thinks he wounded both of them,
but we can't be sure.</i>

01:39:34.302 --> 01:39:36.646
<i>Far as I know, we have two units, code 100.</i>

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:38.932
Aw, Bigfoot, you're adorable.

01:39:39.098 --> 01:39:41.567
<i>I'm sure I got them. Both of them.</i>

01:39:41.767 --> 01:39:43.690
<i>The rest of us can shake the area on foot.</i>

01:39:43.853 --> 01:39:47.778
<i>Johnson, you and your partner stay here and
preserve the scene for the investigators.</i>

01:39:50.693 --> 01:39:52.036
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:54.572
Hi, Shasta.

01:39:56.365 --> 01:39:57.742
Hi, Doc.

01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:06.585
Well, either I'm on the time machine...

01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:08.253
...or you're back.

01:40:09.587 --> 01:40:11.760
I've been away.

01:40:13.090 --> 01:40:15.434
- Where you been?
- Up north.

01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:17.266
Family stuff.

01:40:20.014 --> 01:40:22.608
Anything been happening down here?

01:40:26.938 --> 01:40:32.069
Your friend in the, uh,
construction business?

01:40:32.235 --> 01:40:34.283
Oh, that's all over.

01:40:34.445 --> 01:40:37.790
He's back with Sloane and the kids.
And so what?

01:40:37.949 --> 01:40:39.622
Mm-hm.

01:40:40.243 --> 01:40:43.747
You know you got a load of people
out looking for you, Shasta.

01:40:43.913 --> 01:40:45.210
Well, here I am.

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:47.421
C'est la vie.

01:40:47.583 --> 01:40:48.835
“C'est la vie."

01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:51.720
<i>Que se fucking sera sera.</i>

01:40:54.298 --> 01:40:56.266
Something like that.

01:41:05.685 --> 01:41:07.483
Well, I like your necklace.

01:41:10.398 --> 01:41:12.275
Can't be good.

01:41:18.114 --> 01:41:19.240
Mm-hm.

01:41:19.782 --> 01:41:22.285
Yeah, word is your girl's back in town.

01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:25.580
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, that's news to me.</i>

01:41:26.497 --> 01:41:27.919
Where you been?

01:41:28.541 --> 01:41:30.669
No place I'd recommend.

01:41:32.587 --> 01:41:35.136
<i>Any developments
on the Coy Harlingen matter?</i>

01:41:35.298 --> 01:41:36.800
Like you give a shit?

01:41:36.966 --> 01:41:41.346
Any of them include Prussia or Beaverton
or any of the fuckers that I've given you?

01:41:41.554 --> 01:41:43.522
All right, forget that. Listen, listen.

01:41:43.681 --> 01:41:46.025
Any results on those fang marks?

01:41:46.225 --> 01:41:49.604
Coroner's people got very upset with me
for suggesting more lab work.

01:41:52.023 --> 01:41:56.824
Well, I just thought it'd be a helpful tip
to a fellow professional.

01:41:56.986 --> 01:41:59.705
- You know?
- Oh, really? How's that, Sportello?

01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:03.830
Yeah, when your own, um,
hearing comes up.

01:42:05.036 --> 01:42:06.663
What are you suggesting?

01:42:11.417 --> 01:42:15.718
One county supervisor with a bug up his <i>ass</i>
is all it takes to bring you down, Bigfoot.

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:26.398
This is Mrs. Chastity Bjornsen...

01:42:26.557 --> 01:42:30.278
...and if that is one more sociopathic
"special employee" of my husband...

01:42:30.436 --> 01:42:33.656
...I will thank you
to stop harassing him on his day off.

01:42:33.814 --> 01:42:34.906
It's Sportello.

01:42:35.066 --> 01:42:38.912
Oh, Sportello.
Doc Sportello? The Doc Sportello?

01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:40.913
So we meet at last.

01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:43.245
Mr. Moral Fucking Turpitude himself!

01:42:43.407 --> 01:42:45.910
Have you any idea
of the therapist bills around here...

01:42:46.077 --> 01:42:48.079
...for which you are directly responsible?

01:42:48.245 --> 01:42:50.794
- The department picks up a little.
- Oh, the department?

01:42:50.956 --> 01:42:53.880
Yeah, after a deductible
that would choke a fucking horse.

01:42:54.627 --> 01:42:56.300
All right, you know, he called me.

01:42:56.462 --> 01:43:00.717
<i>I fail to understand your spineless
response to that dirty, hippie piece of shit.</i>

01:43:00.883 --> 01:43:02.601
<i>Would you get the fuck up?</i>

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.762
<i>Get the fuck up, Christian.</i>

01:43:05.721 --> 01:43:07.439
<i>Christian, get the fuck up!</i>

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:09.938
- Now, Christian, please!
- Okay.

01:43:10.101 --> 01:43:14.777
And would you stop acting like a beaten dog.
I ask you for one fucking day a week.

01:43:15.523 --> 01:43:16.820
No...

01:43:42.466 --> 01:43:44.764
What kind of girl do you need, Doc?

01:43:50.683 --> 01:43:53.812
Maybe a thing for one
of those Manson chicks?

01:43:55.604 --> 01:43:59.074
Well, thing is that...

01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:01.327
...depends on what...

01:44:01.485 --> 01:44:03.613
Are you sure you wanna be doing that?

01:44:03.779 --> 01:44:08.000
Submissive, brainwashed, horny, little
teeners who do exactly what you want...

01:44:08.159 --> 01:44:10.537
...before you even know what that is.

01:44:12.788 --> 01:44:17.760
You don't have to say a word out loud.
They get it all by ESP.

01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:20.671
Your kind of chick, Doc?

01:44:22.757 --> 01:44:25.010
You the one that's been stealing
my magazines?

01:44:25.801 --> 01:44:27.519
What would Charlie do?

01:44:31.849 --> 01:44:34.022
Well, probably not this.

01:44:55.956 --> 01:44:59.711
Listen, I'm sorry about Mickey.

01:44:59.877 --> 01:45:01.220
Mickey.

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:10.434
Mickey could have taught all you
swinging beach bums a thing or two.

01:45:12.348 --> 01:45:15.318
He was just so powerful.

01:45:18.479 --> 01:45:21.983
Sometimes he could almost
make you feel invisible.

01:45:25.611 --> 01:45:27.033
Fast

01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:30.742
Brutal.

01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:36.255
Not what you'd call a considerate lover.

01:45:39.834 --> 01:45:42.383
But we adored it about him.

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:47.557
Me...

01:45:49.593 --> 01:45:52.767
...and Sloane and Luz.

01:45:58.269 --> 01:46:02.524
It's so nice to be made to feel invisible
that way sometimes.

01:46:02.690 --> 01:46:04.442
Mm.

01:46:05.067 --> 01:46:08.617
And guys just love
to hear shit like this.

01:46:21.125 --> 01:46:23.969
He'd bring me to
lunch in Beverly Hills.

01:46:26.589 --> 01:46:29.433
One big hand wrapped
around my bare arm...

01:46:29.592 --> 01:46:32.311
...steering me blind
down those bright streets...

01:46:32.469 --> 01:46:35.643
...into some space
where it was dark and cool.

01:46:35.806 --> 01:46:39.185
You couldn't smell any food, only alcohol.

01:46:41.103 --> 01:46:43.447
He had tables full of them.

01:46:44.148 --> 01:46:45.900
They'd all be drinking...

01:46:49.278 --> 01:46:52.828
...in a room that could have been any size.

01:46:55.075 --> 01:46:57.169
And they all knew Mickey.

01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:02.208
They wanted, some of them...

01:47:04.001 --> 01:47:05.924
...to be Mickey.

01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:13.094
He might as well have been
bringing me in on a leash.

01:47:19.308 --> 01:47:21.606
He kept me in those micro-minidresses...

01:47:21.769 --> 01:47:24.864
...never allowing me
to wear anything underneath.

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:35.870
Just offering me up
to whoever wanted...

01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:38.248
<i>...to stare...</i>

01:47:39.787 --> 01:47:41.289
...or grab.

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:47.716
Sometimes, he'd fix me up
with some of his friends...

01:47:47.878 --> 01:47:51.883
...and I'd have to do whatever they wanted.

01:47:52.508 --> 01:47:54.385
Why are you telling me this?

01:47:56.261 --> 01:47:58.434
I'm sorry, Doc.

01:47:59.223 --> 01:48:01.021
Do you want me to stop?

01:48:06.897 --> 01:48:10.117
If my girlfriend had run off
to be the bought-and-sold whore...

01:48:10.275 --> 01:48:13.028
...of some scumbag developer...

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:19.577
I'd just be so angry,
I don't know what I'd do.

01:48:26.417 --> 01:48:27.760
No.

01:48:29.878 --> 01:48:33.428
I'm even lying about that.
I know what I'd do.

01:48:35.592 --> 01:48:38.846
If I had the faithless little bitch
over my lap like this...

01:49:40.657 --> 01:49:43.376
This doesn't mean we're back together.

01:49:45.871 --> 01:49:46.963
Mm.

01:49:47.122 --> 01:49:48.669
Of course not.

01:50:23.033 --> 01:50:26.879
You didn't get this necklace up North, hmm?

01:50:30.207 --> 01:50:32.380
I went on a boat ride.

01:50:35.963 --> 01:50:37.931
Like a three-hour tour?

01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:43.387
They told me...

01:50:43.554 --> 01:50:48.230
...I was precious cargo that couldn't
be insured because of inherent vice.

01:50:49.393 --> 01:50:50.940
What's that?

01:50:53.564 --> 01:50:55.032
I don't know.

01:51:10.122 --> 01:51:12.250
- Hmm?
- Kiss me.

01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:39.030
<i>"Inherent vice,"
in a marine insurance policy...</i>

01:51:39.193 --> 01:51:42.117
<i>...is anything that you can't avoid.</i>

01:51:42.279 --> 01:51:43.576
<i>Eggs break...</i>

01:51:43.739 --> 01:51:45.116
<i>...chocolate melts...</i>

01:51:45.282 --> 01:51:47.455
<i>...glass shatters...</i>

01:51:47.618 --> 01:51:52.249
<i>...and Doc wondered what that meant
when it applied to ex-old ladies.</i>

01:52:03.467 --> 01:52:05.219
What's on your mind, Doc?

01:52:06.303 --> 01:52:08.180
Besides the usual?

01:52:11.558 --> 01:52:13.060
I don't know.

01:52:14.728 --> 01:52:17.197
I'm like, you know...

01:52:18.732 --> 01:52:22.453
...working myself
into a brain freeze here, Lège.

01:52:25.322 --> 01:52:27.495
Well, put it another way:

01:52:27.658 --> 01:52:30.286
What's gonna nag at you
in the middle of the night?

01:52:30.869 --> 01:52:34.169
What's gonna nag at me
in the middle of the night?

01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:38.593
Little kid blues?

01:52:40.504 --> 01:52:42.552
Saxophone players?

01:52:47.719 --> 01:52:49.517
You know, whatever...

01:52:50.847 --> 01:52:55.023
...he meant to do...
Coy, you know, mistakes aside, and...

01:52:58.021 --> 01:53:01.571
Nobody deserves to go through life
without seeing their daughter.

01:53:02.359 --> 01:53:04.202
That don't sit well with me.

01:53:09.408 --> 01:53:11.081
Then go get them.

01:53:13.495 --> 01:53:14.963
- Put it on your desk.
- Thank you.

01:53:15.122 --> 01:53:17.796
- Whoa. What are you doing here? Yeah.
- “Whoa"?

01:53:17.958 --> 01:53:21.383
Wanted to see if you were free for dinner.
I didn't mean to freak you out.

01:53:21.545 --> 01:53:23.047
Are you all right?

01:53:23.213 --> 01:53:25.307
- Am I?
- Are you?

01:53:26.216 --> 01:53:28.344
Should I call security?

01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:30.729
- No, Rhus.
- I don't think we need...

01:53:30.929 --> 01:53:33.057
This is the one
I was telling you about.

01:53:44.359 --> 01:53:45.406
Yeah?

01:53:45.569 --> 01:53:47.412
You know your pals
have Mickey Wolfmann?

01:53:47.571 --> 01:53:51.075
What? The FBI? I mean, we suspected,
but we couldn't prove it.

01:53:51.241 --> 01:53:52.788
Well, I saw him in their custody.

01:53:52.951 --> 01:53:54.828
- You saw him?
- Yeah.

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.048
Would you be willing
to let me depone you?

01:53:59.207 --> 01:54:00.504
- Sure would.
- You would?

01:54:00.667 --> 01:54:01.759
What is it?

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:04.884
You, me, a tape machine,
maybe another DDA to witness it.

01:54:05.047 --> 01:54:07.766
- All right, I need something from you though.
- What?

01:54:07.924 --> 01:54:09.926
I need to look up somebody's jacket.

01:54:10.635 --> 01:54:13.514
That's it? That's no big deal.
We do that all the time.

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:16.559
What, you break into officially
sealed records all the time?

01:54:17.142 --> 01:54:19.110
Grow up. What's the name on the file?

01:54:20.729 --> 01:54:22.697
Adrian Prussia.

01:54:34.409 --> 01:54:37.629
<i>As if looking for something
he didn't want to find...</i>

01:54:37.788 --> 01:54:41.292
<i>...it became clear as vodka
you keep in the icebox...</i>

01:54:41.458 --> 01:54:46.180
<i>...that, whatever the connection
between the L.A.P.D. and Adrian Prussia...</i>

01:54:46.338 --> 01:54:49.638
<i>...he might as well have been working
for them as a contract killer...</i>

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:52.428
<i>...doing deeds for them
they couldn't do for themselves.</i>

01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:58.647
<i>Time after time, he was pulled in,
questioned, arraigned, indicted, no matter.</i>

01:54:58.809 --> 01:55:01.153
<i>Somehow the cases
never quite got to trial...</i>

01:55:01.311 --> 01:55:04.815
<i>...each being bargained down
in the interest of justice...</i>

01:55:05.023 --> 01:55:08.118
<i>...not to mention Adrian,
who invariably walked.</i>

01:55:08.276 --> 01:55:10.995
<i>And one of those deeds
appeared to be labeled...</i>

01:55:11.196 --> 01:55:15.747
<i>... "the justifiable homicide"
of one of the L.A.P.D.'s very own:</i>

01:55:15.909 --> 01:55:18.583
<i>Vincent indelicato.</i>

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:20.292
<i>Otherwise known as...</i>

01:55:20.455 --> 01:55:21.877
<i>...Bigfoot's partner.</i>

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:23.337
Bigfoot.

01:55:24.501 --> 01:55:26.048
<i>Bigfoot's partner?</i>

01:55:26.211 --> 01:55:28.430
<i>Fucking Bigfoot's partner?</i>

01:55:28.588 --> 01:55:31.216
Oh, fuck.

01:55:31.383 --> 01:55:36.435
<i>Bigfoot's air of possessed
melancholy now began to make sense.</i>

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:38.519
<i>This was mourning, all right.</i>

01:55:39.141 --> 01:55:40.188
<i>And it was deep.</i>

01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:41.897
This your new partner, Bigfoot?

01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:45.280
Want a banana, Adrian?
Bend over and I'll stick it in for you.

01:55:45.439 --> 01:55:47.237
Fuck you and fuck your banana.

01:55:47.399 --> 01:55:49.447
Oh, man, oh, man.

01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:54.206
<i>Never be surprised at the levels
of disrespect within the L.A.P.D.</i>

01:55:54.364 --> 01:55:58.585
<i>But this was downright nasty,
not to mention unprofessional.</i>

01:55:58.743 --> 01:56:02.748
<i>This bond between partners was nearly
the only thing Doc had ever found...</i>

01:56:02.914 --> 01:56:05.383
<i>...to admire about the L.A.P.D.</i>

01:56:06.209 --> 01:56:09.133
<i>You know, there's places
you don't wanna go, Doc.</i>

01:56:10.297 --> 01:56:12.049
Go back to the beach.

01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:15.010
You smell like a patchouli fart.

01:56:16.887 --> 01:56:18.810
<i>So here's Doc.</i>

01:56:20.432 --> 01:56:22.776
<i>Midnight, pitch-dark.</i> ..

01:56:22.934 --> 01:56:25.653
<i>...can't remember whether
they drained the pool or not...</i>

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:28.235
<i>...but, hey, what the fuck's it matter?</i>

01:56:28.773 --> 01:56:31.492
<i>He bounced once, twice...</i>

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:34.871
<i>...and then off the end of the board
in</i> a <i>blind cannonball...</i>

01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:38.625
<i>...down into old karma
with Adrian Prussia...</i>

01:56:38.783 --> 01:56:40.626
<i>...who had not only shot at him once...</i>

01:56:40.785 --> 01:56:44.665
<i>...but threatened him
with a Carl Yastrzemski Special baseball bat.</i>

01:56:44.831 --> 01:56:47.926
<i>All this leaving Doc to wonder:</i>

01:56:48.084 --> 01:56:50.507
<i>"Where's the partner to watch my back?"</i>

01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:54.512
Far out, man.

01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:56.597
Right.

01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:59.262
Psychedelic.

01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:01.397
Done.

01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:09.773
So you're here about...?

01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:12.192
Good question.

01:57:12.442 --> 01:57:14.069
Uh...

01:57:16.738 --> 01:57:20.163
Wait a minute.
This is bullshit.

01:57:20.909 --> 01:57:22.126
I remember you.

01:57:23.119 --> 01:57:26.248
You're that kid from Fritz's shop
out in Santa Monica, right?

01:57:26.414 --> 01:57:27.461
Yeah.

01:57:27.666 --> 01:57:30.761
So, what you up to these days?
Skip tracing?

01:57:30.919 --> 01:57:33.092
Or did you go into the priesthood?

01:57:34.005 --> 01:57:35.348
PI.

01:57:36.049 --> 01:57:39.474
Heh. They gave you a license?

01:57:40.637 --> 01:57:42.389
So who sent you here?

01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:44.565
- Mm. Uh...
- Who are you working for today?

01:57:44.724 --> 01:57:47.398
All on spec.
All on my own time.

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:51.447
Wrong answer.

01:57:52.649 --> 01:57:56.745
How much of your own time
do you think you got left, kid?

01:57:57.821 --> 01:58:00.540
I was just about to ask.

01:58:02.367 --> 01:58:04.586
Howdy, Puck.

01:58:04.744 --> 01:58:06.337
Do I know you?

01:58:06.496 --> 01:58:08.624
I don't think I do.

01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:12.385
I don't know, you must remind me
of someone I ran into someplace.

01:58:12.544 --> 01:58:13.761
My mistake.

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:17.174
I have a busy day ahead...

01:58:18.383 --> 01:58:20.727
...and I know nothing...

01:58:21.928 --> 01:58:23.771
...of any of this.

01:58:31.104 --> 01:58:32.651
What are you doing here?

01:58:34.816 --> 01:58:38.195
I was just, uh, talking to Adrian.

01:58:40.697 --> 01:58:42.165
Mm.

01:58:42.699 --> 01:58:44.201
It's these, uh...

01:58:45.535 --> 01:58:47.833
...various cases I'm working on.

01:58:47.996 --> 01:58:49.498
And, uh...

01:58:51.791 --> 01:58:54.886
...mm, Glen Charlock...

01:58:55.837 --> 01:58:59.512
...and, uh, Vincent indelicato...

01:59:13.146 --> 01:59:14.739
...and, uh...

01:59:14.898 --> 01:59:16.741
...where'd...

01:59:18.735 --> 01:59:20.078
...you...

01:59:20.695 --> 01:59:22.072
...get that-?

01:59:24.532 --> 01:59:26.534
That necklace...

01:59:26.701 --> 01:59:28.669
...it looks funny on you.

01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:31.297
Big man, small necklace.

01:59:33.124 --> 01:59:36.094
Acid invites you through a door.

01:59:36.795 --> 01:59:39.639
PCP opens that door...

01:59:39.798 --> 01:59:41.220
<i>...shoves you through it...</i>

01:59:41.383 --> 01:59:43.852
...slams the door behind you...

01:59:44.844 --> 01:59:45.891
...and locks it.

01:59:54.312 --> 01:59:56.690
Special treat for you today, doper.

01:59:57.357 --> 01:59:59.280
Just got it in a shipment...

01:59:59.442 --> 02:00:01.444
...of pure Number 4.

02:00:02.737 --> 02:00:05.411
Ain't a white guy's finger laid on it...

02:00:05.573 --> 02:00:07.871
...between the Golden Triangle...

02:00:09.786 --> 02:00:12.130
...and your own throbbing vein.

02:00:13.164 --> 02:00:15.508
Just let me step out here...

02:00:16.167 --> 02:00:17.840
...and I'll go get you some.

02:00:25.009 --> 02:00:26.761
Don't go away now.

02:01:37.207 --> 02:01:38.550
Puck!

02:01:44.839 --> 02:01:46.307
Pucky!

02:02:04.901 --> 02:02:06.574
Did I hit you?

02:02:34.764 --> 02:02:36.186
Bigfoot?

02:02:36.766 --> 02:02:38.518
What the fuck?

02:02:40.311 --> 02:02:42.655
Did you take care of them okay, Doc?

02:02:42.814 --> 02:02:47.160
You fucking lunatic! What is this?

02:02:47.318 --> 02:02:49.912
I'm in enough shit personally
with the captain...

02:02:50.071 --> 02:02:52.699
...and I've seen you on the range.
Nice work.

02:02:54.450 --> 02:02:55.702
What are you...?

02:02:56.786 --> 02:03:00.165
And that there,
is that what I think it is? Huh?

02:03:00.331 --> 02:03:04.086
There's one of or two of them.
There's more. Enough left for evidence.

02:03:04.252 --> 02:03:06.880
Man, Bigfoot, I saw the movie.

02:03:07.046 --> 02:03:10.596
As I recall, that character
comes to a bad end.

02:03:10.758 --> 02:03:12.180
Put the gun away, Doc.

02:03:12.343 --> 02:03:13.890
- What?
- The gun. Put it away.

02:03:14.053 --> 02:03:17.148
This is the Golden Fang
you're about to rip off, man.

02:03:17.307 --> 02:03:20.436
The fully fucking weird outfit
that kills people.

02:03:20.602 --> 02:03:24.027
That's according to your own
delusional system. Get in the car.

02:03:24.188 --> 02:03:25.656
Get in the car!

02:03:48.171 --> 02:03:49.844
Where are we going?

02:03:51.299 --> 02:03:54.348
We had to impound your car again.

02:03:55.053 --> 02:03:57.021
It was parked illegally...

02:03:57.847 --> 02:03:59.690
...in front of Adrian's.

02:04:34.842 --> 02:04:36.185
<i>Psst.</i>

02:04:36.344 --> 02:04:39.769
<i>Doper's ESP, Doc.</i>

02:04:39.931 --> 02:04:42.480
<i>Doper's ESP.</i>

02:04:48.564 --> 02:04:51.238
<i>Oh, no.</i>

02:04:51.401 --> 02:04:54.405
<i>Bigfoot, you motherfucker.</i>

02:04:55.905 --> 02:05:00.786
<i>Okay, Doc, you have what looks to be</i>
a <i>20-kilo inconvenience in your trunk.</i>

02:05:00.952 --> 02:05:04.422
<i>And Bigfoot, no doubt,
putting out word to that effect.</i>

02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:07.208
<i>And once again, you're the bait.</i>

02:05:33.443 --> 02:05:34.945
Hello?

02:05:35.111 --> 02:05:37.409
<i>It's sure been a long time.</i>

02:05:38.322 --> 02:05:40.450
And your name was?

02:05:41.034 --> 02:05:42.877
<i>This is Crocker Fenway.</i>

02:05:43.411 --> 02:05:45.459
Japonica's dad?

02:05:46.289 --> 02:05:48.007
Oh...

02:05:48.166 --> 02:05:49.918
What happened this time?

02:05:50.084 --> 02:05:54.635
<i>You have something that belongs to some
people I represent, and they'd like it back.</i>

02:05:55.757 --> 02:05:59.432
Oh. So you're a principal in all this?

02:05:59.594 --> 02:06:02.894
<i>It's only because of me
and our small transaction over Japonica...</i>

02:06:03.056 --> 02:06:05.104
<i>...that you're still alive.</i>

02:06:05.266 --> 02:06:07.485
Ever so grateful, sir.

02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:11.363
So, what do we do?

02:06:11.522 --> 02:06:13.741
I suppose someone wants their, uh...

02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:16.201
...back?

02:06:16.819 --> 02:06:21.916
<i>Why don't we meet this evening at 6:00
at my club, The Portola, in Elysian Park.</i>

02:06:23.201 --> 02:06:25.795
Mm-hm. ls there a dress code?

02:06:25.953 --> 02:06:28.297
<i>A jacket and tie, if possible.</i>

02:06:29.999 --> 02:06:31.717
I'll see you then.

02:06:43.763 --> 02:06:45.686
Mr. Sportello.

02:06:46.474 --> 02:06:48.192
Mr. Fenway.

02:07:03.407 --> 02:07:05.705
To a peaceful...

02:07:06.744 --> 02:07:08.291
...resolution.

02:07:14.210 --> 02:07:16.884
How's the family?

02:07:17.421 --> 02:07:19.048
Japonica's...

02:07:19.799 --> 02:07:21.722
...doing fine, if that's what you mean.

02:07:23.761 --> 02:07:25.183
You know...

02:07:25.346 --> 02:07:29.442
...I think I saw old Japonica
the other day at my doctor's office.

02:07:31.102 --> 02:07:34.572
You ever run across a dentist
named Rudy Blatnoyd?

02:07:34.772 --> 02:07:38.822
The son of a bitch who until recently
was corrupting my daughter?

02:07:38.985 --> 02:07:41.613
Yes, I do seem to recall the name.

02:07:41.779 --> 02:07:45.409
He perished in a trampoline accident,
didn't he?

02:07:45.575 --> 02:07:48.328
L.A.P.D. aren't so sure it was an accident.

02:07:49.078 --> 02:07:51.297
And you'd like to know if I did it?

02:07:54.083 --> 02:07:56.131
What possible motive would I have?

02:07:57.670 --> 02:08:00.093
Just because the man preyed on...

02:08:00.256 --> 02:08:03.180
...an emotionally vulnerable child?

02:08:03.968 --> 02:08:06.062
Forced her to engage
in sexual practices...

02:08:06.220 --> 02:08:09.645
...that might appall
even a sophisticate like yourself?

02:08:09.807 --> 02:08:12.481
Does that mean I'd have any reason
to see his miserable...

02:08:12.643 --> 02:08:14.395
...pedophile career come to an end?

02:08:14.562 --> 02:08:18.658
What a vindictive person
you must imagine me.

02:08:19.150 --> 02:08:20.777
Mm...

02:08:20.943 --> 02:08:26.370
Mm, I did suspect he was fucking
his receptionist, but what dentist doesn't?

02:08:26.532 --> 02:08:28.955
It's some oath they
all take in dentist school.

02:08:29.118 --> 02:08:34.716
Anyhow, it's a long way
from strange and weird sex, isn't it?

02:08:34.874 --> 02:08:37.047
What about when he forced
my girl to listen...

02:08:37.210 --> 02:08:41.306
...to original cast albums of Broadway
musicals while he had his way with her?

02:08:44.842 --> 02:08:48.392
Or the tastelessness of the decor...

02:08:49.889 --> 02:08:52.608
...of resort hotel rooms he took her to...

02:08:52.767 --> 02:08:56.021
...during endodontist conventions.

02:08:56.187 --> 02:08:57.655
The wallpaper.

02:08:58.814 --> 02:09:00.782
The lamps.

02:09:03.986 --> 02:09:06.785
Japonica's of legal age now, isn't she?

02:09:07.365 --> 02:09:10.039
In a father's eye,
they're always too young.

02:09:18.084 --> 02:09:19.677
To the matter at hand.

02:09:19.835 --> 02:09:23.885
Those I represent are prepared to offer you
a generous compensation package...

02:09:24.048 --> 02:09:26.767
...for the safe return of their property.

02:09:27.927 --> 02:09:30.521
Suppose it didn't have to be
in the form of money.

02:09:31.764 --> 02:09:34.017
Well, money would be a lot easier.

02:09:36.227 --> 02:09:39.401
There's a saxophone player
named Coy Harlingen.

02:09:39.563 --> 02:09:43.909
He's been working undercover for different
anti-subversive outfits, including the L.A.P.D.

02:09:44.068 --> 02:09:48.494
And he's come to feel lately
that he made the wrong career choice.

02:09:48.656 --> 02:09:50.829
It lost him his family, his freedom.

02:09:50.992 --> 02:09:53.211
And like you, he only has one daughter.

02:09:53.911 --> 02:09:55.379
Please.

02:09:55.538 --> 02:09:59.168
Okay. Well, he wants out.

02:09:59.333 --> 02:10:01.756
And I think I can
square it with the heat.

02:10:01.919 --> 02:10:05.594
But there's this other bunch,
Vigilant California.

02:10:05.756 --> 02:10:08.009
And, well, whoever's running them,
of course...

02:10:12.805 --> 02:10:16.855
My guess is they'd prefer he not disclose
any confidential information.

02:10:17.018 --> 02:10:18.861
Last thing he'd ever do.

02:10:19.395 --> 02:10:20.897
Your personal guarantee?

02:10:21.105 --> 02:10:23.403
I'll go after him myself
if he tries anything.

02:10:24.734 --> 02:10:26.452
Then we have a deal.

02:10:28.195 --> 02:10:29.868
That's all you wanted?

02:10:30.031 --> 02:10:32.204
No money now?
Are you sure?

02:10:35.244 --> 02:10:39.340
Well, now, how much money would I have to
take from you so I wouldn't lose your respect?

02:10:41.125 --> 02:10:44.129
It's a bit late for that, Mr. Sportello.

02:10:44.295 --> 02:10:48.596
People like you lose all claim to respect
the first time they pay anybody rent.

02:10:53.095 --> 02:10:55.814
Well, I may not be as well-connected...

02:10:55.973 --> 02:10:59.728
...and for sure, not as much
into revenge as you folks are...

02:11:01.312 --> 02:11:03.940
...but if you're jiving with me, my man...

02:11:04.106 --> 02:11:05.153
...I say to you:

02:11:08.194 --> 02:11:09.616
Hmm?

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:16.452
So where we gonna do this handoff?

02:11:18.829 --> 02:11:20.547
<i>Don't know much about history</i>

02:11:21.499 --> 02:11:24.252
<i>Don't know much biology</i>

02:11:25.336 --> 02:11:28.180
<i>Don't know much about science books</i>

02:11:28.339 --> 02:11:31.684
Golden Fang operatives, 12 o'clock.
Fast approaching.

02:11:31.842 --> 02:11:33.185
Look sharp.

02:11:36.597 --> 02:11:39.191
<i>And I know that if you love me too</i>

02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:42.229
<i>What a wonderful world it would be</i>

02:11:44.063 --> 02:11:46.862
<i>Don't know much about geography</i>

02:11:47.691 --> 02:11:50.615
<i>Don't know much trigonometry</i>

02:11:51.404 --> 02:11:54.157
All right, you got the keys in here?

02:11:55.282 --> 02:11:57.455
<i>Don't know what a slide rule is for</i>

02:11:58.911 --> 02:12:01.630
<i>But I do know, one and one is two</i>

02:12:02.289 --> 02:12:05.338
<i>And if this world could be with you</i>

02:12:05.501 --> 02:12:08.505
<i>What a wonderful world this would be</i>

02:12:10.798 --> 02:12:12.596
Now, what's all this?

02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:16.349
It's a credit card.
Don't hippies have them?

02:12:16.512 --> 02:12:20.016
Yeah, I must've meant that why is
your mother handing me this?

02:12:20.182 --> 02:12:23.436
- It's not for you.
- Ah. Uh...

02:12:24.478 --> 02:12:28.699
You're supposed to tell him: "Well done.
Welcome back to the main herd.

02:12:28.858 --> 02:12:30.360
Safe journeys."

02:12:30.526 --> 02:12:32.119
That's journeys, plural.

02:12:32.278 --> 02:12:34.701
"Well done. Welcome back to the herd.
Safe journeys."

02:12:34.864 --> 02:12:37.037
Okay, I guess I can remember that.

02:12:47.376 --> 02:12:49.378
- What are you looking at?
- Huh?

02:12:49.545 --> 02:12:50.762
What?

02:12:57.094 --> 02:13:01.065
So you guys been working
for the Golden Fang long?

02:13:12.151 --> 02:13:13.368
Okay.

02:13:23.287 --> 02:13:26.291
Sassy, little girl. Nasty. Mean.

02:13:34.465 --> 02:13:36.934
There's nothing? All right.

02:14:00.491 --> 02:14:01.617
Everything's cool.

02:14:01.784 --> 02:14:05.163
I'm officially off everybody's payroll.
Burke Stodger just called me.

02:14:05.329 --> 02:14:06.876
You're a dangerous hombre.

02:14:07.039 --> 02:14:08.291
Drive.

02:14:31.313 --> 02:14:32.656
You all right?

02:14:34.608 --> 02:14:36.326
I'm nervous.

02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:38.195
Yeah.

02:14:41.115 --> 02:14:43.163
You know what the Indians say.

02:14:44.118 --> 02:14:45.836
- You saved my life...
- Ugh...

02:14:45.995 --> 02:14:47.872
...now you're responsible for it.

02:14:48.038 --> 02:14:50.666
No, man. No, that's not true.

02:14:52.042 --> 02:14:54.215
Some hippie made that up, man.

02:14:55.462 --> 02:14:58.261
You saved your own life, man.
Now you get to live it.

02:15:53.979 --> 02:15:55.447
Baby!

02:16:13.957 --> 02:16:17.461
<i>Yet there is no avoiding time.</i>

02:16:17.628 --> 02:16:19.881
<i>The sea of time.</i>

02:16:20.881 --> 02:16:24.431
<i>The sea of memory and forgetfulness.</i>

02:16:24.593 --> 02:16:28.939
<i>The years of promise gone
and unrecoverable.</i>

02:16:29.098 --> 02:16:33.022
<i>Of the land almost allowed
to claim its better destiny...</i>

02:16:33.184 --> 02:16:37.861
<i>...only to have that claim jumped
by evildoers known all too well...</i>

02:16:38.022 --> 02:16:39.525
<i>...and taken instead...</i>

02:16:39.691 --> 02:16:44.619
<i>...and held hostage to the future
we must live in now, forever.</i>

02:16:44.780 --> 02:16:46.498
So who got her?

02:16:46.656 --> 02:16:48.375
Department of Justice.

02:16:48.534 --> 02:16:50.753
So, like, uh, justice was served?

02:16:50.911 --> 02:16:54.540
That's exactly right, Doc.
That's exactly right.

02:16:54.707 --> 02:16:59.964
<i>May we trust this blessed ship
is bound for some better shore.</i>

02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:02.882
<i>Risen and redeemed.</i>

02:17:03.382 --> 02:17:08.808
<i>Where the American fate
mercifully fatted to transpire.</i>

02:17:22.567 --> 02:17:24.161
Don't get up.

02:17:24.318 --> 02:17:26.538
Bigfoot. Man...

02:17:27.322 --> 02:17:29.495
You smashed down my door?

02:17:30.117 --> 02:17:31.243
Come on.

02:17:31.660 --> 02:17:35.459
After a long and busy day
of civil rights violations...

02:17:36.206 --> 02:17:39.880
...I found myself in the neighborhood
and compelled to drop in.

02:17:40.419 --> 02:17:45.141
Just to check and see the current state
of affairs of my old stomping grounds.

02:17:45.299 --> 02:17:49.020
Seeing as your effort to keep lines
of communication had been...

02:17:49.178 --> 02:17:50.395
...limited.

02:17:50.554 --> 02:17:52.352
To say the least.

02:17:53.348 --> 02:17:56.022
Well, I've been busy.

02:17:56.769 --> 02:18:00.615
Trying to figure out which side
of the Zig-Zag paper's the sticky side?

02:18:03.566 --> 02:18:05.240
Give it to me.

02:18:33.513 --> 02:18:34.731
Listen.

02:18:34.932 --> 02:18:36.900
- I'm sorry about last night.
- I'm sorry about last night

02:18:37.058 --> 02:18:38.481
- You?
- You?

02:18:38.644 --> 02:18:40.566
Why should you be sorry?

02:18:42.356 --> 02:18:44.074
Weird.

02:19:13.512 --> 02:19:15.513
Uh...

02:19:19.726 --> 02:19:21.853
Are you okay, brother?

02:19:26.316 --> 02:19:28.410
I'm not your brother.

02:19:29.903 --> 02:19:32.576
No, but you could use a keeper.

02:19:52.259 --> 02:19:54.011
<i>Remember that day?</i>

02:19:54.177 --> 02:19:57.522
<i>The Ouija board set us off
into that big storm?</i>

02:20:00.434 --> 02:20:02.937
This feels the same way tonight.

02:20:06.023 --> 02:20:07.650
Just us.

02:20:08.317 --> 02:20:09.785
Together.

02:20:15.574 --> 02:20:18.293
Almost like being underwater.

02:20:22.205 --> 02:20:24.003
The world...

02:20:25.959 --> 02:20:27.677
...everything...

02:20:30.255 --> 02:20:32.553
...gone someplace else.

02:20:37.804 --> 02:20:40.774
Just figured it was
Sortilége setting us up.

02:20:43.852 --> 02:20:45.104
No.

02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:47.147
Her Ouija board and...

02:20:47.314 --> 02:20:51.114
- She knows things, Doc.
- Mm.

02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:56.494
Maybe about us
that we don't know.

02:21:12.214 --> 02:21:14.888
This don't mean we're back together.

02:21:22.557 --> 02:21:24.309
Of course not.
