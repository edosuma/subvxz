<i>NARRATOR".
A quiet, balmy midnight in Gotham City.</i>

00:15.099 --> 00:17.310
<i>Not a creature is stirring...</i>

00:17.519 --> 00:19.729
. . . <i>except these creatures.</i>

00:19.938 --> 00:22.899
<i>Though they're barely stirring.</i>

00:23.107 --> 00:25.068
<i>And this creature.</i>

00:25.276 --> 00:27.529
<i>An Egyptian king?</i>

00:27.737 --> 00:29.447
<i>And a tank full of crocodiles?</i>

00:30.990 --> 00:33.701
<i>In our beloved borough?</i>

00:33.910 --> 00:36.621
Yes, my babies.

00:36.829 --> 00:41.167
Sethos,
how's my crowning achievement coming?

00:41.376 --> 00:43.545
Any news from the Royal Lapidary?

00:43.753 --> 00:48.091
Unless he's behind schedule, he should
be opening that safe at this very moment.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

00:57.350 --> 01:01.729
Dig this perfect blue-white diamond.

01:01.938 --> 01:08.903
Sixty-eight carats if she's an ounce,
or my name ain't Amenophis Tewfik.

01:09.112 --> 01:12.282
The king did not send me,
his Royal Lapidary, for diamonds.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.077
What's going on?

01:17.787 --> 01:21.291
How did you get in here?
I can't have this sort of thing, you know?

01:21.499 --> 01:27.088
I advise you both to remain quite motionless
while I summon the authorities.

01:33.511 --> 01:38.558
Ah. This should be
more to His Kingship's taste.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.894
- What is it?
-A string of amber beads.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.938
Amber beads?

01:44.147 --> 01:45.607
Exactly, Tutly.

01:45.815 --> 01:47.191
With beauties such as these...

01:47.358 --> 01:49.861
...His Royal Kingship
shall hatch an infernal scheme...

01:50.028 --> 01:54.032
...that within a fortnight should have
all of Gotham City in his royal clutches.

01:55.617 --> 01:58.661
Miss Patrick, a headache pill, please.

01:58.870 --> 02:04.292
I still don't quite understand how you could
be rendered unconscious by a lead pencil.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.629
Pestle, commissioner. A lead pestle.

02:07.837 --> 02:10.256
Which my assailants dropped
in their escape.

02:11.007 --> 02:12.342
Hmm.

02:13.217 --> 02:15.970
Uh, no, no, Miss Patrick, I don't need a pill.
It's for Mister, uh...

02:16.137 --> 02:18.931
Oh. Time for your mid-morning vitamin,
commissioner.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.975
Oh, really? Oh, well, what do you know.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.977
All right, thank you.

02:24.145 --> 02:27.190
Pestle. A lead pestle.

02:28.775 --> 02:31.653
Odd sort of weapon, don't you agree?

02:32.153 --> 02:37.450
And rather odd assailants, come to think of it,
in their strange Egyptian garbs.

02:37.659 --> 02:38.910
Egyptian?

02:39.118 --> 02:41.621
Well, there can be no doubt about it,
commissioner.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.457
The mad monarch
must once again be on the loose.

02:44.666 --> 02:49.045
And have something even madder than ever
up his fourth-dynasty sleeve.

02:49.253 --> 02:53.257
Gentlemen, I propose to call Batman.

02:55.551 --> 02:56.594
Yes, commissioner?

02:56.761 --> 02:59.347
<i>A strange and terrible threat to Gotham City.</i>

02:59.514 --> 03:01.099
<i>An ultimatum from the remote past.</i>

03:01.307 --> 03:02.642
<i>I think it's King Tut.</i>

03:02.850 --> 03:04.686
We're on our way.

03:04.894 --> 03:07.897
Holy hieroglyphics.
This might mean a battle royal.

03:08.106 --> 03:10.108
Not the first, Dick, nor the last.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.193
To the Batpoles.

04:37.904 --> 04:42.742
Egyptian garb, amber beads, lead pestles.
Can there be any doubt about it, Boy Wonder?

04:42.909 --> 04:44.619
Only the shadow of a doubt perhaps...

04:44.786 --> 04:47.497
...but certainly worth a telephone call
to Yale University.

04:47.663 --> 04:50.416
That's a sharp idea.
Positively trenchant, Batman.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.376
Miss Patrick.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.425
- Something for you, Batman?
-No. No pills.

04:59.634 --> 05:03.179
No, thank you, my dear.
I seldom resort to medication of any kind.

05:03.387 --> 05:06.933
You see, one's body
has remarkable restorative powers of its own.

05:07.141 --> 05:12.772
Miss Patrick, please, just get Dean Gerber
on the telephone for Batman at Yale University.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.398
Yes, sir.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.902
I would hate to think
that our eminent professor of Egyptology...

05:18.110 --> 05:21.322
...had suffered a relapse
into his eerie twin trauma.

05:21.489 --> 05:25.284
You're too soft on hardened arch criminals,
Batman.

05:25.493 --> 05:29.163
But, Chief O'Hara, he really believed
Gotham City was ancient Thebes...

05:29.372 --> 05:32.583
...and that he himself
was the reincarnation of King Tut.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.585
Dean Gerber on three.

05:34.752 --> 05:37.004
Uh, you take it, Batman.

05:38.214 --> 05:40.925
Hello, Dean Gerber. This is Batman.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.387
Batman.

05:45.221 --> 05:48.516
B-A-T-M-A-N.

05:48.975 --> 05:51.394
That's right, Dean Gerber, in Gotham City.

05:52.353 --> 05:56.107
I'm calling in reference
to your professor of Egyptology.

05:56.440 --> 06:00.194
Oh? When did he take over the chair?

06:00.486 --> 06:02.530
And his predecessor?

06:04.407 --> 06:05.783
Oh.

06:06.075 --> 06:08.578
Yes, that's what I was afraid of.

06:08.786 --> 06:11.289
Thank you. Goodbye.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.877
Bad news, Batman?

06:16.085 --> 06:18.045
It couldn't be worse.

06:18.588 --> 06:23.426
The professor fell off the podium
during a teach-in and hasn't been seen since.

06:24.093 --> 06:27.138
Holy sarcophagus.
That means he's a supercrook again.

06:27.305 --> 06:32.852
But what kind of a supercrook would scoff
at genuine diamonds and rubies...

06:33.060 --> 06:36.314
...and then have his stooges make off
with a string of amber beads?

06:36.522 --> 06:38.441
Some of them even with beetles in them.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.693
Beetles, Chief O'Hara?

06:40.902 --> 06:44.614
You mean scarabs imprisoned in amber?

06:46.741 --> 06:49.952
A lead pestle.

06:51.037 --> 06:54.790
Pestles haven't been made of lead
since the turn of the century.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.084
Does that suggest something, Batman?

06:57.293 --> 06:59.670
Yes. An apothecary.

06:59.879 --> 07:04.842
A word recently superseded
by that of druggists or pharmacists.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.471
Commissioner, do you have a copy
of the Gotham City classified directory?

07:08.638 --> 07:10.306
Miss Patrick.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.475
No, no pills, please.

07:12.683 --> 07:15.144
Just bring Batman the classified directory,
please.

07:15.353 --> 07:17.563
It would be a pleasure.

07:19.690 --> 07:24.153
I'm afraid the summer relief girl for my
regular secretary Bonnie isn't much of a relief.

07:24.737 --> 07:29.158
She seems eager to please,
a virtue in anyone.

07:30.034 --> 07:32.328
That will be all, Miss Patrick. Thank you.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.080
Thank you.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.920
Aha. Just as I surmised.

07:41.128 --> 07:45.299
Of the dozens of pharmacies,
the scores of drugstores in Gotham City...

07:45.508 --> 07:47.927
...there's only one apothecary.

07:48.135 --> 07:51.347
The Apex Apothecary Shop
in the Pyramid Building.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.225
Doubtless to be found on the top floor.

07:54.433 --> 07:57.687
Let's pay them a call, Robin.

07:59.730 --> 08:04.110
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in a back room
of the Apex Apothecary Shop...</i>

08:04.318 --> 08:09.323
<i>...the demented despot is engaged
in an unholy operation.</i>

08:09.824 --> 08:13.411
<i>What kind of black magic is this?</i>

08:13.703 --> 08:17.665
<i>An attempt to release the dead
from their ancient tomb?</i>

08:18.290 --> 08:22.503
If you ask me, giving them bugs the hot-foot
ain't gonna do nothing.

08:22.712 --> 08:26.215
Dead is dead,
or my name ain't Amenophis Tewfik.

08:26.424 --> 08:30.678
These are not bugs, Amenophis.

08:31.095 --> 08:37.601
They are scarabs of a species extinct
for at least 4000 years.

08:38.144 --> 08:42.732
Encased in amber,
they have slumbered away the centuries...

08:42.940 --> 08:46.485
...in a state of suspended animation.

08:46.694 --> 08:50.781
And now I shall begin
their shock treatments...

08:50.990 --> 08:53.826
...to reactivate their little nervous systems.

08:54.368 --> 08:59.373
About 100,000 volts,
wouldn't you say, Royal Apothecary?

08:59.582 --> 09:00.833
I concur, doctor.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.085
Power.

09:04.295 --> 09:06.297
- Power.
- Amps.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.091
Amps.

09:09.258 --> 09:12.344
- Air.
- Air.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.014
One hundred thousand volts.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.187
One hundred thousand volts.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.608
Oxygen.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.486
Oxygen.

09:28.694 --> 09:32.239
Breathe, my children.

09:32.448 --> 09:36.452
Free yourselves from the arms of Osiris.

09:36.660 --> 09:40.581
Shake off the shackles of the sepulcher.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.583
Live.

09:43.042 --> 09:44.627
Live.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.338
Live!

09:50.800 --> 09:51.926
They ain't living.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.680
More oxygen. I'm going to 200,000 volts.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.401
Failure.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.571
Abject failure.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.201
All my plans...

10:17.409 --> 10:22.373
...all my dreams of domination,
crumbled into dust.

10:22.790 --> 10:28.129
I shall end this miserable existence...

10:28.337 --> 10:33.300
...by throwing myself
off the Aswan High Dam.

10:40.015 --> 10:43.644
How about that?
That cockroach is really kicking.

10:44.728 --> 10:49.650
No, it's not.
You're just saying that to make me feel good.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.527
They're all kicking.

10:51.735 --> 10:55.656
Look, Your Kingship,
you've got yourself a batch of real live ones.

10:57.116 --> 10:58.951
I have?

11:05.708 --> 11:07.626
Thank heavens.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.880
I have!

11:19.847 --> 11:23.893
Gee-whiz, Batman, dropping in on a drugstore
might have been easier.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.312
Exercise never hurt anyone, Robin.

11:26.520 --> 11:31.650
We must always keep the element of surprise
on our side.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.777
What are you doing here?

11:34.445 --> 11:36.197
I might ask you the same question.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.992
Pursuing enemies of law and order
wherever they happen to be.

11:40.201 --> 11:42.119
Aren't you in the wrong city?

11:42.328 --> 11:45.539
On special assignment for The <i>Daily</i> Sentinel.
You know my aide, Kato.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.167
Robin, the Boy Wonder.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.253
Well, I don't wanna hold you up
from your crime-fighting.

11:51.462 --> 11:53.923
Thank you,
and good luck to you, Mr. Hornet.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.091
Nice to have met you.

11:57.968 --> 12:01.096
Gosh, Batman,
what are they dressed like that for?

12:04.975 --> 12:07.144
They live, they live!

12:07.436 --> 12:10.940
Shh! What's that?

12:11.357 --> 12:13.943
It's the burglar alarm bell
on the main shop window.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.694
Go see who it is.

12:15.903 --> 12:19.406
Don't just stand there. Go see who it is.

12:28.123 --> 12:33.337
Gentlemen, you might have found the elevator
a little more convenient.

12:33.545 --> 12:38.217
But what form of curative do you require?

12:38.842 --> 12:40.177
Nothing, thank you.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.846
A nostrum called nothing?

12:43.055 --> 12:45.975
That I do not carry, sirrah. But...

12:47.935 --> 12:52.523
...I do have all kinds of potions...

12:52.731 --> 12:54.566
...lotions...

12:54.775 --> 12:58.737
...and notions in stock.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.614
No, nothing.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.493
And, uh, what's in the back room?

13:04.702 --> 13:08.706
Trolls and ghouls and amulets.

13:08.914 --> 13:15.170
Evil spells that will turn your bones
to celery stalks.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.966
Nevertheless,
I think we should take a look for ourselves.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.926
But, no!

13:22.052 --> 13:24.972
Take another think, Batman.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.406
We took care of them.

14:24.615 --> 14:25.741
We powdered them, boss.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.952
Good. Through the backdoor,
down the fire escape.

14:29.161 --> 14:31.497
Bolt the door behind us.

14:33.374 --> 14:34.666
Here, here.

14:39.213 --> 14:41.840
Too late, Robin.
Thanks to a well-equipped...

14:43.425 --> 14:45.386
...apothecary.

14:45.928 --> 14:49.264
Foiled again by that fat pharaoh.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.353
What's that?

14:55.687 --> 14:58.148
Look.Look.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.944
Holy Frankenstein.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.071
-It's alive.
-Yes.

15:04.238 --> 15:06.615
- But what is it?
-Scarabaeus sacer.

15:06.824 --> 15:11.286
A specie of ancient Egyptian beetle
sacred to the sun god Hymeopolos...

15:11.495 --> 15:15.040
...and from which the term "scarab"
is derived.

15:15.249 --> 15:18.585
You should know that, Robin,
if you're up on your studies of Egyptology.

15:18.794 --> 15:20.629
You're right.

15:20.796 --> 15:24.633
Ah. Think of it. Think of it.

15:24.842 --> 15:28.804
An insect like this, extinct for centuries...

15:29.012 --> 15:32.975
...suddenly unleashed on our community.

15:34.560 --> 15:38.897
I know hieroglyphics self-taught
are a chore, Robin.

15:39.773 --> 15:45.154
But it's a surefire way to unravel
the secrets of the ancient mystics.

15:45.362 --> 15:48.365
You mean you've discovered
what that moonstruck monarch is up to?

15:48.574 --> 15:49.741
I fear so.

15:49.950 --> 15:54.580
Inscribed
upon this ancient papyrus scroll...

15:54.788 --> 15:59.418
...is the chemical formula
for abu raubu simbu tu.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.836
Abu what?

16:01.044 --> 16:02.588
Abu raubu simbu tu.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.131
In more modern terms:

16:04.339 --> 16:07.468
CK to the second power
plus OL to the ninth power...

16:07.676 --> 16:12.055
...equals KO to the third power
plus 2CL to the fourth power.

16:12.264 --> 16:15.726
CK to the second power?
What kind of equation is that?

16:15.934 --> 16:20.981
In the more modern lexicon of chemistry,
one that has been obsolete for years...

16:21.190 --> 16:24.860
...because the most important ingredient
is missing.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.737
Unavailable.

16:26.945 --> 16:30.365
Distilled essence of scarab lymphs.

16:30.574 --> 16:33.368
- Holy corpuscles.
-Yes.

16:33.577 --> 16:38.040
And this ingredient, combined
with other elements in the chemical formula...

16:38.248 --> 16:43.378
...produces a potion
capable of paralyzing the human will.

16:43.712 --> 16:47.341
Tut could put Gotham City under his power
if he can make enough of the stuff.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.426
And get it to the populous somehow.

16:49.635 --> 16:52.679
- He only has a few resurrected scarabs.
-Unfortunately, Robin...

16:52.888 --> 16:57.142
...given the proper climatic conditions,
scarabs are able to multiply a thousand fold.

16:57.351 --> 16:59.394
- Yes, Alfred?
-Just coming to report, sir.

16:59.603 --> 17:03.315
The talking sphinx will be on the lawn
of Wayne Manor within hours.

17:03.524 --> 17:05.776
- Talking sphinx?
-If you remember, Robin...

17:05.983 --> 17:11.240
...last year Tut made his royal predictions
through the great stone sphinx...

17:11.448 --> 17:13.992
...thus creating terror in this city.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.244
Oh, of course. How could I have forgotten?

17:16.453 --> 17:20.499
I recently heard
that the sphinx was being offered for sale.

17:20.707 --> 17:21.750
Sold?

17:21.959 --> 17:24.586
Just when I was going
to have need of it again.

17:24.795 --> 17:27.339
Who purchased my inscrutable lady?

17:27.548 --> 17:29.466
Millionaire Bruce Wayne.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.094
Yeah, I might have known it.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.595
Sheer spite.

17:33.804 --> 17:36.056
Just because I kidnapped him last year.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.892
What's he planning to do,
make a reading lamp out of her?

17:39.059 --> 17:45.774
"Mr. Wayne has been quoted as saying...

17:46.608 --> 17:49.194
...he will donate...

17:49.403 --> 17:55.367
...this criminal curiosity...

17:55.951 --> 17:59.496
...to the Black Museum...

18:00.038 --> 18:04.084
...at Scotland Yard."

18:04.293 --> 18:06.378
The Black Museum.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.131
<i>Scotland Yard.</i>

18:09.756 --> 18:11.967
That's the Hall of Fame.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.803
Now I belong to the ages.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.138
Just think of it.

18:16.346 --> 18:19.600
Cheek to jowl
with such great ones of crimes:

18:19.808 --> 18:25.188
Landru, Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden.

18:25.397 --> 18:28.358
- And the Lavender Hill Mob.
-Ha, ha, yes.

18:28.525 --> 18:35.073
Now, I need my unfathomable female here
and now for my royal predictions.

18:35.282 --> 18:39.453
After I'm crowned king of Gotham City,
we can think about the Black Museum.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.955
Oh, we didn't think of it, Your Kingship.
Mister--

18:42.164 --> 18:44.708
I know it, Sethos!

18:44.916 --> 18:50.714
But Mr. Bruce Wayne may have
second thoughts coming very shortly.

18:53.300 --> 18:59.723
When night descends on Wayne Manor,
you too will descend...

18:59.931 --> 19:02.643
...and pinch my sphinx.

19:20.077 --> 19:25.165
- Shh. Quietly.
-There's only one light in the house, upstairs.

19:25.374 --> 19:26.667
I don't think anyone's home.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.086
Sure. This sphinx pinch is a cinch.

19:29.294 --> 19:30.337
Push.

19:35.050 --> 19:36.802
Well, Alfred...

19:37.010 --> 19:42.766
...it looks like my young ward and I
are going fishing again for the big one.

19:49.856 --> 19:54.778
Welcome home, my inscrutable lady.

19:54.986 --> 20:00.242
Soon I'll have a new prophecy
for you to announce.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.163
It's Tut all right, Batman.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.374
I think we're in some kind of greenhouse.

20:07.582 --> 20:09.668
I know, chum.
I've been getting your messages.

20:09.876 --> 20:13.046
I've tracked you
to the old, abandoned Gizeh Gardens...

20:13.255 --> 20:15.048
...at the corner of Elm and Harvard.

20:15.674 --> 20:19.553
I'll see what else I can find out.
You may wanna call Commissioner Gordon.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.264
Your Majesty.

20:22.472 --> 20:23.682
It worked, Your Majesty.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.393
The experiment is a success.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.437
It worked. Ha-ha-ha!

20:28.645 --> 20:30.021
It worked!

20:30.230 --> 20:33.150
Praise to the sacred baboons.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.777
The cow goddess of Hathor.

20:35.986 --> 20:38.155
Osiris, the holy one.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.115
Oh, yes, yes.

20:40.323 --> 20:43.535
And praise me too.

20:43.744 --> 20:48.331
For the first time
since the golden age of Ramses Junior...

20:48.540 --> 20:53.754
...there exists the elixir
of abu raubu simbu tu.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.964
Now may I go back to my apothecary shop?

20:56.173 --> 20:57.883
Don't be a booby.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.594
There's still work to be done.

21:00.802 --> 21:05.599
First, you must crystallize this lovely nectar
into a powder...

21:05.807 --> 21:10.061
...and then insert the powder into a capsule.

21:10.729 --> 21:12.731
Like so.

21:13.899 --> 21:19.321
And you, Cleo,
my lovely queen of the Nile in exile...

21:19.529 --> 21:23.033
...you know what to do then, don't you?

21:23.241 --> 21:24.993
Yeah, Tut-tut.

21:25.202 --> 21:29.664
I slip it to Commissioner Gordon
instead of his mid-morning vitamin A.

21:31.708 --> 21:32.959
Batman, you better--

21:35.879 --> 21:37.881
That couldn't have made a noise.

21:38.048 --> 21:40.008
I haven't hooked up a loud speaker system.

21:40.217 --> 21:44.554
Well, I sure heard something,
boss, or my name ain't Ameno-- Ooh.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.601
Perhaps we should take a look,
Your Kingship.

21:49.810 --> 21:53.104
The sphinx is hollow,
but it may not be empty.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.774
Good idea, Royal Lapidary.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.693
Release the hidden spring.

22:04.157 --> 22:07.369
We've lost him. He must have dropped
the Bat-radio. It's sensitive.

22:07.577 --> 22:12.040
- Whatever will you do now, sir?
-There's always the Bat-geiger Counter.

22:14.793 --> 22:16.169
Good.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.921
It's picking him up already.

22:18.129 --> 22:19.172
How?

22:19.381 --> 22:22.342
I planted radioactive Bat-pellets in his belt.

22:22.551 --> 22:26.263
Now, if I can just synchronize
this miniaturized model...

22:26.471 --> 22:30.016
...with the parent Bat-geiger Counter...

22:30.809 --> 22:33.311
...ah!
We should have no trouble finding him.

22:33.770 --> 22:34.855
Drag him out.

22:38.024 --> 22:41.236
On your knees, Helot.

22:41.444 --> 22:44.614
On your knees before the almighty pharaoh.

22:44.823 --> 22:45.991
Never.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.118
What? Never?

22:48.326 --> 22:51.580
You dare to match your will against mine?

22:51.788 --> 22:55.750
Give him a shot of your bug juice, boss.
That will take the wind out of his sails.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.086
Good idea, Tutling.

22:58.295 --> 22:59.921
We have need of a guinea pig.

23:00.130 --> 23:03.091
Proceed, Royal Apothecary.

23:04.092 --> 23:06.261
Get him, get him!

23:09.431 --> 23:11.266
Get him. Get him!

23:11.474 --> 23:13.101
Watch out for the scarabs!

23:16.438 --> 23:19.107
All right, my young testee.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.319
It will only sting for a minute.

23:22.527 --> 23:25.447
Then your cares will be over forever.

23:25.655 --> 23:27.240
No!

23:33.830 --> 23:35.081
Holy jawbreaker.

23:40.921 --> 23:43.632
I told you, my lovelies, if all went well...

23:43.840 --> 23:48.094
...you'd soon be dining
on something better than frogs and fishes.

23:48.303 --> 23:51.890
Not much better, granted,
but he'll do for a snack.

23:52.098 --> 23:55.060
I hope you all have healthy appetites.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.937
Eat your din-din.
