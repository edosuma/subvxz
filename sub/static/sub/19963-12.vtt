00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:03.771 --> 00:05.037
<i> (theme music playing)</i>

00:08.642 --> 00:12.211
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.213 --> 00:14.279
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.281 --> 00:19.852
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:19.854 --> 00:22.821
<i> ¶ Got a beautiful breeze</i>
<i> blowing through ¶</i>

00:22.823 --> 00:27.826
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>
<i> who knows where ¶</i>

00:27.828 --> 00:30.362
<i> ¶ And I'll get there I swear ¶</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:35.968
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:50.217 --> 00:51.483
He went this way!

00:56.223 --> 00:58.924
I'm sorry.
Were you looking for this?

01:01.929 --> 01:03.162
(chuckles)

01:05.900 --> 01:08.400
Strongbow is a diversion!
Get Rider!

01:08.402 --> 01:09.935
Huh?

01:09.937 --> 01:12.971
Gah! After them!
Go! Go! Go!

01:14.275 --> 01:15.340
(all panting)

01:15.342 --> 01:17.376
We lost them.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.244
Oh, come on!
Seriously, guys!

01:20.748 --> 01:23.282
(panting) Man, we were
so close this time.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.452
Well, if by "close",
you mean "not even a little,"

01:26.454 --> 01:28.253
then yes,
I completely agree.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.523
Fellas, if you can't catch us
when we're going easy on you,

01:31.525 --> 01:33.692
how do you expect
to catch this "master thief"

01:33.694 --> 01:35.294
that's terrorizing the town?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.396
Captain calls him
the Silent Striker.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.264
Yeah, I'm not calling him that.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.399
Eugene:
Well, Captain,

01:40.401 --> 01:42.701
I believe this exercise
in humility has proven

01:42.703 --> 01:46.305
that my esteemed colleague,
Lance here, is more
than qualified

01:46.307 --> 01:47.806
to assist me
in training your men

01:47.808 --> 01:49.741
in the fine art
of thief-catching.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.577
So, what do you say?

01:51.579 --> 01:52.878
Does he get the job?

01:52.880 --> 01:54.480
No.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.383
Eh, I'm not sure
how I feel

01:58.385 --> 02:00.319
about this whole
public servant
business anyway.

02:00.321 --> 02:04.423
Rapunzel:
The entire kingdom is in a panic
over this Silent Striker,

02:04.425 --> 02:08.393
so Pascal and I figured
we had to do our part
to help catch him.

02:11.432 --> 02:15.934
Uh, Raps, maybe you should leave
the bad-guy snatching
to the pros.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.403
Wait, Cass! No!

02:18.405 --> 02:19.505
It's so obvi--

02:19.507 --> 02:20.739
(screaming)

02:21.742 --> 02:23.609
Obvious was
kind of the point.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.310
Here, let me
help you down.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.447
No, no,
I'll do it myself,
thank you.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.482
-But I have
a safer way to get you...
-(cutting and ripping)

02:30.484 --> 02:32.618
(grunting)
My leg!

02:32.620 --> 02:34.586
...down.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.356
(laughing)
It's almost
laughably simple.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.424
We catch this Striker,
prove that you're trustworthy,

02:39.426 --> 02:41.927
and bam-o,
the Captain hires you
on the spot.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.529
Then let's find us
the Striker.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.764
Well, he's not here.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.466
Ooh, let's get kebabs.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.801
Oh, forget the kebabs!
We've got detective work
to do!

02:49.803 --> 02:51.436
(dejectedly)
But the kebabs...

02:52.606 --> 02:54.006
Cobbler:
<i> As I always do each morning,</i>

02:54.008 --> 02:55.774
<i> I placed my best shoes</i>
<i> in the display window.</i>

02:55.776 --> 02:56.842
(bell ringing)

02:59.046 --> 03:00.846
Cobbler:
<i> He took all my money...</i>

03:00.848 --> 03:03.448
...from the till,
from the safe,

03:03.450 --> 03:05.117
even my secret shoe stash.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.520
Hummina!

03:08.522 --> 03:10.889
Monty:
<i> It happened during</i>
<i> the after-school rush.</i>

03:10.891 --> 03:12.791
<i> That's my busiest time.</i>

03:16.497 --> 03:17.796
(gasping)

03:17.798 --> 03:19.031
He cleaned me out.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.566
Mmm. Mmm.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.701
Uh, you know you gotta
pay for those, son.

03:24.672 --> 03:27.673
Xavier:
<i> I was walking over</i>
<i> to get a customer her change.</i>

03:27.675 --> 03:29.841
<i> I turned my back</i>
<i> for one second,</i>

03:29.843 --> 03:32.945
<i> and suddenly,</i>
<i> the whole chest was empty.</i>

03:34.481 --> 03:37.716
Uh-huh. I believe we have
enough to go on here.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.485
Well, that was a waste of time.

03:40.487 --> 03:41.920
Hey, look at that!

03:42.890 --> 03:44.823
Hmm.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.491
Hold on a second.

03:46.493 --> 03:47.826
We hit a dead-end.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.361
Hey!

03:49.363 --> 03:51.530
What do we really know
about this guy, huh?

03:51.532 --> 03:53.398
He hits his marks
during peak hours,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.601
his preferred
method of extraction
is using sleight of hand,

03:55.603 --> 03:57.002
and he's after cash only.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.538
Oh, and he's also
working through town

03:59.540 --> 04:01.573
using a distinct
inward spiral pattern,

04:01.575 --> 04:04.576
which points us
to the exact area
he will strike next.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.980
I'd say we have
enough to set a trap
for our Silent Striker.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.728
Come on, everybody.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.563
Fast, fun money,
ladies and gents.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.765
Just find the coin
and win the purse.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.737
Ah, wrong trail!
Who's next? Next up!

04:31.739 --> 04:33.905
Ah, wrong trail! Try again!

04:33.907 --> 04:34.973
Ow!

04:37.044 --> 04:38.710
Gotcha!

04:38.712 --> 04:41.780
(laughs) Not so silent
or strike-y anymore, are you?

04:41.782 --> 04:45.751
Now, let's get a look
at this so-called master thief.

04:45.753 --> 04:49.154
Wow! I did not
see that coming.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.825
Eugene:
Your Majesty, Captain,

04:53.827 --> 04:57.029
may I present
the Silent Strikers?

04:57.965 --> 05:00.132
They're children.

05:00.134 --> 05:03.769
(sarcastically) Wow, Captain,
figure that out by yourself,

05:03.771 --> 05:06.138
or did your ace detectives
tip you off?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.910
What are
your names, children?

05:11.912 --> 05:13.679
She doesn't talk much,

05:13.681 --> 05:15.781
but they call us
the Bidness sisters.

05:15.783 --> 05:16.848
I'm Nonya.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.117
Well, Nonya Bidness...

05:19.119 --> 05:20.752
(girls giggling)

05:20.754 --> 05:22.954
Very funny.
No one is laugh--

05:22.956 --> 05:24.656
(laughing)

05:24.658 --> 05:25.757
-I did.
-That was funny.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.958
That was definitely
a little funny.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.628
We can't send
two children to jail.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.764
But we can't just let
these two criminals go either.

05:32.766 --> 05:36.101
Yeah, they'll just run off
and start stealing again.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.170
Speaking from
personal experience anyway.

05:38.172 --> 05:42.040
Yes, you and Eugene too
have past experience,
don't you?

05:42.042 --> 05:46.044
Perhaps the two of you could
take these two under your wing
for a few days.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.714
See if you can't
help them straighten up.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.982
And get them to return
what they took.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.618
Oh, we're flattered,

05:53.620 --> 05:55.954
but see, Lance and I
really aren't about kids.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.890
(laughing) Or wings.
I'm a drumstick man.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.994
This might be
exactly the thing
that could earn my trust.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.696
But, of course,
what kind of guys

06:04.698 --> 06:06.898
would turn their backs
on children in need?

06:06.900 --> 06:09.201
Very good.
I will leave them
in your hands.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.171
So, we mentor
some cute kids
for a day or so.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.940
How hard could it be?

06:18.145 --> 06:20.812
You will be on your feet
before you know it, Cass.

06:20.814 --> 06:25.183
But until then,
nurses Pascal and Rapunzel
are at your service.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.519
So, what would you like us
to do first?

06:27.521 --> 06:28.754
(Pascal squeaking)

06:29.823 --> 06:32.824
Uh, I really appreciate it,
Raps, really,

06:32.826 --> 06:35.894
but I don't do the whole
getting nurtured thing, so...

06:35.896 --> 06:38.029
Oh, okay.
(laughs)

06:38.031 --> 06:41.600
I get it.
You wanna handle things
in the typical Cass fashion,

06:41.602 --> 06:42.834
solo.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.870
Remember, though,
if you need anything...

06:44.872 --> 06:47.105
I just need
some peace and quiet.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.673
Right.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.575
And maybe an extra pillow?

06:50.577 --> 06:51.943
Soup? Lullaby?

06:51.945 --> 06:54.045
Should I rotate your mattress?

06:54.047 --> 06:56.581
Brush your hair?
Bed-time story?

06:56.583 --> 06:58.116
Facial?
Game of checkers?

06:58.118 --> 06:59.985
-(door closing)
-(sighing)

07:01.121 --> 07:03.088
(door opening)

07:03.090 --> 07:04.890
Are you sure you're--

07:04.892 --> 07:06.124
-I'm fine!
-(door closing)

07:12.866 --> 07:14.099
(both panting)

07:14.101 --> 07:16.067
Let me go!

07:16.069 --> 07:18.970
Okay, first rule
of not being a thief.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.573
Don't steal.
Pretty obvious.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.908
Second rule--

07:22.910 --> 07:24.943
Making people
chase you five miles
makes them cranky.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.248
Aw! Aren't you
a fancy little thief?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.150
I'm calling mine Red,
'cause she's got--

07:32.152 --> 07:34.052
Red hair.
Yeah, I get it.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.087
You can't just--
Ow! Oh!

07:36.089 --> 07:37.989
Okay, I'm calling mine Angry.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.825
We don't do nicknames.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.561
Listen, Angry,
you don't wanna be here,

07:42.563 --> 07:43.829
and we don't wanna be here.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.096
So fancy!

07:45.098 --> 07:46.998
(grumbles)
So, just return
what you stole,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.567
and we can all
get on with our lives.

07:48.569 --> 07:51.169
Besides, you don't
wanna be thieves.
Trust us.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.171
It's not a viable
long-term career.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.073
Maybe you two
were just bad at it.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.176
(gasps)
Bad at it?
Bad at it?

07:58.178 --> 08:01.112
-We were
the original Strikers, okay?
-Mm-hmm.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.781
We invented techniques
that are used by criminals

08:02.783 --> 08:04.483
all around the world
to this day.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.184
-All around the world.
-You ever heard
of the Drop and Stop?

08:08.021 --> 08:09.688
-Seriously? Never?
-Kids today!

08:09.690 --> 08:11.990
We used to use it all the time
to rob caravans back in the day.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.292
See, one of us would find a way
to distract the lead carriage

08:14.294 --> 08:17.262
while the other would
go around back and steal...

08:17.264 --> 08:18.663
La, la, la.
You know what? Never mind.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.032
My point is the life
of a criminal is hard.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.300
You're always on the run.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.202
Not to mention
the enemies you make.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.638
Whew! We once
tried to double-cross
this guy called the Baron.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.673
He hasn't stopped
hunting us since.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.308
Of course,
it didn't help matters

08:30.310 --> 08:33.879
that Eugene stole
his prize stallion.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.181
And the worst part
is the guilt you have
to live with.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.050
You see this?
First thing I ever stole.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.686
It's a shameful reminder
of my criminal past.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.123
Why'd you steal
something so worthless?

08:45.125 --> 08:46.892
What? You...

08:46.893 --> 08:48.660
It's not worthless.
It has sentimental...

08:48.662 --> 08:49.694
It's worthless.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.829
Thieving tip number one.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.632
Take the most valuable
thing in the room.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.300
Lance, Lance,

08:55.302 --> 08:57.168
we've gotta make
them better people,
not better thieves.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.904
-Thieves are people too.
-(chains clanking)

09:01.174 --> 09:02.741
(sighs) You know,
I'm impressed.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.143
Annoyed, yes,
but I'm impressed.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.313
(Eugene and Lance panting)

09:08.315 --> 09:09.881
You know, we could
scare them straight.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.884
Of course,
we'd have to take them
to some tough-looking types.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.819
You and I,
we're too pretty
to be scary.

09:14.821 --> 09:18.023
(chuckles) Well,
you're half right, anyway.

09:18.025 --> 09:21.192
Who do we know
that's both scary and ugly?

09:21.194 --> 09:23.194
Well, well, well,

09:23.196 --> 09:26.831
so you think you can handle
a life of crime, huh?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.837
(Hook Foot crying)

09:32.839 --> 09:34.372
I need that to walk.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.342
You know,
that kind of reminded me
of us when we were that age.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.711
Yeah, me too.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.247
-(Hook Foot wailing)
-Man, Hook Foot is really
crying, isn't he?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.182
(marching)

09:47.854 --> 09:51.022
Ugh! Keep it down!

09:51.024 --> 09:53.725
-Stan: What just happened?
-Pete: She's talking to you,
Stan.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.961
-Stan: Me?
-Pete: You're the one
who wanted to march.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.362
I just wanted
to stand right here.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.697
Stan: Say it.
Don't spray it.

09:58.699 --> 10:03.301
(crying)
Guys, I'm trying
to nap in here!

10:09.743 --> 10:12.043
-(door opening)
-(wheelchair rolling)

10:12.045 --> 10:15.747
Sorry. I asked Pete and Stan
to stand outside

10:15.749 --> 10:17.115
and make sure
you got peace and quiet,

10:17.117 --> 10:20.085
but I forgot
they tend to bicker.

10:20.087 --> 10:23.054
(sighing) Rapunzel,
I told you. I don't need--

10:23.056 --> 10:26.091
I just wanted to let you know
that they have been relieved
of duty.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.059
Thank you.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.661
Rapunzel:
And replaced with Maximus.

10:29.663 --> 10:30.795
(door closing)

10:30.797 --> 10:32.497
-(Maximus whinnying)
-(hooves clumping)

10:32.499 --> 10:37.435
-(Maximus whinnying)
-(hooves clumping)

10:37.437 --> 10:39.471
(whimpering)

10:40.407 --> 10:42.140
Hey! Service!

10:42.142 --> 10:44.342
Yeah, place has gotten real slow

10:44.344 --> 10:47.512
since Attila left
to open up shop with Monty.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.750
That's it.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.386
Come on, Red.
We're making lunch.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.354
(sighs)

10:56.356 --> 10:58.356
What's wrong with you?

10:58.358 --> 11:00.258
Oh, what's wrong?
I don't know.

11:00.260 --> 11:04.195
I'm trying to prevent
two smart, little kids
with a world of potential

11:04.197 --> 11:05.697
from throwing their lives away,

11:05.699 --> 11:08.800
and I can't even figure out
how to get them to listen.

11:08.802 --> 11:12.370
Yeah, got yourself
a head-scratcher there.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.705
Let me ask you something.

11:13.707 --> 11:17.375
When you were our age,
would you have listened?

11:19.279 --> 11:22.981
No. In fact,
I'd probably still be
out there cheating and stealing

11:22.983 --> 11:25.550
if it weren't for...
Wait a minute. That's it!

11:25.552 --> 11:27.952
You two are the Striker?

11:27.954 --> 11:30.889
Long hair and brains?
Good for you.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.558
(laughs)
Well, being master thieves,

11:33.560 --> 11:36.161
I bet you're really good
at Hide and Seek.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.396
(scoffs)
That's kid stuff.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.398
Ah, too bad.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.500
I was hoping you'd play
with Pascal and me,

11:42.502 --> 11:44.235
but it's probably better
if you don't.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.138
He's kind of a pro.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.440
(Pascal grunting)

11:50.143 --> 11:51.443
(Pascal squeaking)

11:53.080 --> 11:54.612
(Pascal squeaking)

11:58.752 --> 12:00.452
Can he turn into any color?

12:02.556 --> 12:05.557
What do you know?
Mine does talk.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.894
Sometimes, it's like
he's not even there.

12:10.864 --> 12:11.930
Pascal?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.836
Pascal, you can come out now.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.972
Pascal?

12:22.909 --> 12:24.242
Are you still there?

12:29.750 --> 12:30.882
(Pascal squeaking)

12:30.884 --> 12:32.951
(exclaims)

12:32.953 --> 12:34.452
(Pascal squeaking triumphantly)

12:34.454 --> 12:35.520
(giggling)

12:35.522 --> 12:36.755
(giggling)

12:40.460 --> 12:42.927
Nice, cozy bed.
Not too shabby, huh?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.429
Just think.
If you let me help,

12:44.431 --> 12:46.131
you can get one
of your very own.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.766
Why are you doing all this?

12:47.768 --> 12:50.802
Usually, adults
just try to get rid of us.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.071
They don't take us
to meet princesses.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.874
Well, honestly,
at first,

12:55.876 --> 12:57.375
I was only trying
to get Lance a job.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.980
But now, I just really
wanna help you start over.

13:01.982 --> 13:06.918
(yawning)
Well, starting over
is not that easy.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.386
Stealing is.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.388
Look, I know what it's like
to be angry at the world.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.323
And you're right.
Stealing is easy.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.426
But Rapunzel showed me that
it's when you stop taking
things for yourself

13:15.428 --> 13:17.095
that you really get
the most in return.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.764
It's not like we wanna steal.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.333
We just need enough
to get away.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.435
Get away from who?

13:24.437 --> 13:25.570
Angry?

13:37.250 --> 13:38.416
Hmm?

13:38.418 --> 13:39.584
Shh.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.664
-(door opening)
-(groaning)

13:52.666 --> 13:55.166
-(clanking)
-(gasping)

13:58.605 --> 14:00.672
-(screaming)
-Cass, wait! It's me.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.641
Ugh. Rapunzel,
what are you doing?

14:03.643 --> 14:05.877
Well, you've been
sleeping all day,

14:05.879 --> 14:08.847
and I was worried
you'd wake up in the middle
of the night hungry, and...

14:08.849 --> 14:11.950
Rapunzel,
for the last time,

14:11.952 --> 14:14.986
if I need help,
I'll ask for it.

14:14.988 --> 14:18.890
(scoffs) You know,
Cass, I don't know why
you're making this so hard.

14:18.892 --> 14:21.960
I'm just doing what
any good friend would do.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.229
Thanks, Rapunzel,
but I think I got it.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.464
-(door slamming)
-(sighs)

14:33.206 --> 14:35.073
(Red snoring)

15:01.868 --> 15:04.002
I woke up,
and it was gone.

15:12.545 --> 15:16.414
Not only did you lose track
of two helpless children,

15:16.416 --> 15:19.717
you managed to let them steal
the princess's tiara.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.419
Okay, I wouldn't
call them helpless.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.587
Enough.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.455
Your services are
no longer required here.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.857
You're both fired!

15:28.895 --> 15:30.862
(laughs)
Joke's on that guy.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.196
He never hired me.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.369
I'm so sorry
about your tiara,
Rapunzel.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.805
I thought for sure
I could fix those girls.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.607
You know, like
how you fixed me.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.276
Eugene, I didn't fix you.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.545
You can't make
someone better.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.480
The best you can do
is give them a chance.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.016
If they don't want
your help, then...

15:55.422 --> 15:59.390
...all you can do
is be there for them
until they do.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.160
The thing is I'm sure
they did want help,

16:02.162 --> 16:03.594
but they're running
from something,

16:03.596 --> 16:04.996
and I have a feeling it's bad.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.664
If I just knew
where to look for them.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.633
Cassandra:
You could start
with that flower.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.670
It only grows
by the river cliffs.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.039
You're right!
I'm going to get Lance.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.342
Thank you, Cassandra.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.910
In fact,
to show my appreciation,

16:18.912 --> 16:21.479
I'm not ever going
to make fun of... that.

16:24.985 --> 16:29.821
(sighs)
Cass, I'm sorry
I got so pushy earlier.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.489
And I'm sorry I yelled.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.192
I just couldn't bear
to see you struggle

16:34.194 --> 16:36.327
when I could make things
so much easier for you,

16:36.329 --> 16:38.262
but I shouldn't
have assumed.

16:38.264 --> 16:41.499
From now on,
I will only help
if you ask me.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.667
I can work with that.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.771
Don't look
at me like that.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.439
We had to do it.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.141
The Baron's men are here.

16:50.143 --> 16:54.879
You heard Eugene.
He'll never stop
coming after us.

16:54.881 --> 16:58.883
For two thieves who thought
they were clever enough
to steal from the Baron,

16:58.885 --> 17:01.285
you sure made it
easy to find you.

17:04.657 --> 17:09.193
(girls screaming)

17:09.195 --> 17:10.228
Weasel.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.297
I'd recognize
that smell anywhere.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.565
-(chuckling)
-(struggling)

17:14.567 --> 17:16.134
The girls have been
running from the Baron.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.969
They're in more trouble
than I thought.

17:17.971 --> 17:19.237
So, what do we do?

17:19.239 --> 17:20.538
We're unarmed
and out-numbered.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.540
We can try the Heave Ho,
a Bob and Weave,

17:22.542 --> 17:24.709
a Shoehorn Sam,
a Lucky 18.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.511
No, no tricks.
The girls could get hurt.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.814
What, so we just ask Weasel
to let the girls go real nicely?

17:29.816 --> 17:33.251
Last time I checked,
we were on his boss's
most wanted list, too.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.619
Let's hope
that's still the case.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.121
(sighs)

17:38.358 --> 17:39.690
-Eugene: Anthony the Weasel?
-Huh?

17:39.692 --> 17:41.526
Eugene:
Long time, no see.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.428
Are people still
calling you the Weasel?

17:43.430 --> 17:45.363
I mean, I guess
if you can't change the face,

17:45.365 --> 17:47.331
why change the name, right?

17:47.333 --> 17:50.768
(laughs)
Rider and Strongbow.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.571
To what do I owe
this most dubious pleasure?

17:53.573 --> 17:56.441
I'm here to offer you
the deal of a lifetime,
my frenemy,

17:56.443 --> 17:59.877
the infamous thieves
who double-crossed the Baron
on numerous occasions

17:59.879 --> 18:01.245
in exchange for the kids.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.450
Well, that's an awfully noble
and heroic gesture,

18:05.452 --> 18:09.020
coming from such
a notorious scoundrel
as yourself, Flynn Rider.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.922
Well, what can I say?

18:10.924 --> 18:12.323
People change.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.294
You've got a deal.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.365
What are you doing?

18:21.367 --> 18:23.367
Don't worry about us, kiddo.
We've got a plan.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.269
I just need you two
to run, okay?

18:33.480 --> 18:36.814
Hurry. We can still make
the last boat out of Corona.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.916
I know you're not
happy about this,

18:38.918 --> 18:41.486
but we finally have enough money
to get away from here,

18:41.488 --> 18:43.921
start fresh.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.923
Red:
Everyone is always
turning their backs on us.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.058
Everyone.

18:47.060 --> 18:49.861
Everyone but them.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.433
So, uh, Eugene,

18:55.435 --> 18:57.468
you wanna let me in
on the actual plan
part of this plan?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.971
Yeah, uh, I'm still
working on that.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.906
Let's get back to the Baron.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.915
(rustling)

19:10.917 --> 19:13.384
(birds chirping)

19:15.622 --> 19:16.754
(whinnying)

19:17.757 --> 19:19.090
-Huh?
-I dunno.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.393
(grumbling)

19:25.532 --> 19:27.498
(guards exclaiming)

19:27.500 --> 19:28.766
What the...

19:36.676 --> 19:38.442
Angry, you came back,

19:38.444 --> 19:40.011
and you used
the Drop and Stop.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.513
Thought I'd go old school.
Don't let it get to your head.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.681
Now, come on.

19:45.618 --> 19:46.517
(blowing raspberry)

19:48.788 --> 19:50.421
(grumbling)

19:51.491 --> 19:52.823
I think these
belong to you.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.625
Wait a minute.

19:55.628 --> 19:56.827
Where's the other one?

19:56.829 --> 19:58.529
-(shackle clinking)
-(grumbling)

20:02.502 --> 20:04.669
(door clanging)

20:04.671 --> 20:06.904
Look, I know
I can't force you
to accept my help.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.973
Heck, I don't
even technically work
for the Guards right now,

20:08.975 --> 20:11.642
so I can't even make you
return what you took.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.545
But I can still give you
the chance to change.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.980
What if we don't want it?

20:15.982 --> 20:18.649
Then all I can do
is be here for you
until you do.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.718
Here, I want you
to have this.

20:22.689 --> 20:25.923
(giggling)
As a shameful reminder
of my life of crime?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.558
As a reminder
of the first day

20:27.560 --> 20:29.493
you didn't have
to steal something,

20:29.495 --> 20:31.596
because someone was happy
to give it to you.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.907
Well, so much
for getting you
the job.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.876
Eh, I didn't really wanna
work for the Captain anyway.

20:45.878 --> 20:46.911
Too much yelling.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.579
You let them what?

20:48.581 --> 20:51.048
I take full responsibility
for everything they stole,

20:51.050 --> 20:52.750
and I really want to--

20:52.752 --> 20:54.652
Guard:
Sir, you should come
and see this!

21:02.428 --> 21:04.595
Well, Captain, if everything
has been returned,

21:04.597 --> 21:07.531
there's nothing Eugene needs
to take responsibility for.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.739
And seems to me
the Guards still need
the help of a former thief.

21:14.741 --> 21:15.806
(chuckles)

21:15.808 --> 21:18.109
Or two.

21:18.111 --> 21:23.481
(sighing) I suppose
this means you've been
reinstated, Fitzherbert.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.616
As for Strongbow,

21:25.618 --> 21:28.753
I'm willing to try
having a second consultant

21:28.755 --> 21:30.955
if he's amenable.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.724
Lance, up to you, buddy.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.159
I appreciate the offer,

21:35.161 --> 21:36.661
but no thanks, Captain.

21:36.663 --> 21:39.797
I actually found
a job on my own.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.767
You are looking
at the new chef
of the Snuggly Duckling.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.001
Today is my first day.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.604
-Then why aren't you there?
-I'm taking a personal day.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.805
(sighs deeply)

21:51.844 --> 21:54.045
You sure you're okay
letting them go?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.116
Eugene:
They'll be back.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.651
When they're ready.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.086
(Strongbow chuckling)

22:06.359 --> 22:08.726
("More of Me" playing)

22:25.611 --> 22:28.779
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:28.781 --> 22:30.915
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's more</i>
<i> of me to give ¶</i>

22:32.785 --> 22:33.751
<i> ¶ Yeah ¶</i>

22:33.753 --> 22:35.953
<i> ¶ There's more of me to give ¶</i>
