00:28.779 --> 00:29.697

00:35.745 --> 00:38.037
Oh my God.
Thank you.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.706
Thank you for coming out.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.499
(audience cheering)

00:41.500 --> 00:43.376
It's good to be here.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.670
This is what I look like.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.132
It's mostly my fault.

00:49.133 --> 00:51.926
Well, it's all my fault.

00:51.927 --> 00:53.887
I wish I had
an excuse, you know?

00:53.888 --> 00:57.307
Like I had to gain
all this weight for a movie.

00:57.308 --> 00:59.559
There's no movie.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.019
If you saw me eat,
you would think

01:01.020 --> 01:04.272
there were multiple movies.

01:04.272 --> 01:08.193
Are they doing a
live action "Shrek?"

01:08.194 --> 01:11.488
This guy's gonna be perfect!

01:11.489 --> 01:13.615
I'm wearing my shirt untucked.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.575
The untucked shirt.

01:15.576 --> 01:19.788
The fat man's last hurrah.

01:19.789 --> 01:23.833
Next stop muumuu.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.043
You might see a guy
with his shirt untucked

01:25.044 --> 01:28.838
and think,
"Oh, was he in a hurry?

01:28.839 --> 01:31.216
Is he going casual?"

01:31.217 --> 01:32.801
But you should know
that someone very close

01:32.802 --> 01:35.386
to that man saw him
with his shirt tucked in,

01:35.387 --> 01:38.723
and said, "Don't do that.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.476
"That's visually unpleasing.

01:41.477 --> 01:45.396
You look better
not fully dressed."

01:45.397 --> 01:50.360
The untucked shirt,
it's like the male wonder bra.

01:50.361 --> 01:53.613
There's a surprise
underneath and...

01:53.614 --> 01:56.866
you're not gonna like it.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.118
(audience applauding)

01:59.119 --> 02:02.789
This is not an UNTUCKit.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.290
UNTUCKit, which is
a brand of shirt.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.960
I do love those
UNTUCKit commercials.

02:06.961 --> 02:10.880
They present it like some
revolutionary technology.

02:10.881 --> 02:15.385
It's a shirt that can
be worn untucked.

02:15.386 --> 02:18.471
Wow!

02:18.472 --> 02:21.724
Like a magic shirt?

02:21.725 --> 02:22.976
That's right.

02:22.977 --> 02:25.520
Can other shirts do that?

02:25.521 --> 02:27.105
No, this is a special shirt.

02:27.106 --> 02:30.859
It goes with our
unzipped pants.

02:30.860 --> 02:33.194
And our unbuckled
belt, and combined

02:33.195 --> 02:37.448
with your uncombed hair
you can look unemployed.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.577
And be unwelcome
in restaurants.

02:40.578 --> 02:44.039
That's unbelievable.

02:46.375 --> 02:50.420
This shirt is actually a 2XL.

02:50.421 --> 02:54.257
That's right, I did it.

02:54.258 --> 02:57.760
Mission accomplished.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.388
(audience cheering,
applauding)

03:03.309 --> 03:07.020
There should be a moving up
ceremony for when you hit 2XL.

03:07.021 --> 03:09.689
It is with great pride
and slight disgust,

03:09.690 --> 03:11.983
that we present
this garment roughly

03:11.984 --> 03:14.944
the size of a circus tent,

03:14.945 --> 03:19.490
to this slob who
actually struggles to
put on his own socks.

03:19.491 --> 03:23.328
He may now burp for
no reason at all.

03:23.329 --> 03:25.747
I am new to the 2XL community.

03:25.748 --> 03:29.208
They've been very welcoming.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.376
I did some research.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.629
You know what
the size after 2XL is?

03:32.630 --> 03:35.715
Kill yourself.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.092
No, it's 3X!

03:38.093 --> 03:39.761
Triple X!

03:39.762 --> 03:43.598
That's pornographic.

03:43.599 --> 03:47.602
It's so fat it's obscene.

03:47.603 --> 03:51.981
Triple X does sound like
some fat on fat action.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.652
Oh, yeah.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.528
Oh, yeah.
And I'm headin' there,

03:57.529 --> 04:00.740
hopefully by
the end of the show.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.033
I don't know what happened.

04:02.034 --> 04:07.580
All I did was eat
abusively for 40 years.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.750
And suddenly I'm fat?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.169
That doesn't seem fair.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.629
I am now at the size,

04:14.630 --> 04:16.505
when I go in clothing
stores sales people

04:16.507 --> 04:19.216
look at me like,
"We got nothing for you.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.220
And you can't
use our bathroom."

04:24.014 --> 04:26.349
When I go out to eat,
if I order a salad,

04:26.350 --> 04:29.894
the waiter's
always like, "Aw.

04:29.895 --> 04:33.106
Look at you try."

04:33.107 --> 04:35.191
I'm always afraid he's gonna
gather the whole staff,

04:35.192 --> 04:39.654
"The fat pig is trying,
the fat pig is trying, I..."

04:39.655 --> 04:41.572
(audience laughs)

04:41.573 --> 04:43.449
I've always talked
about my weight

04:43.450 --> 04:46.452
in my stand up but in
the past after shows

04:46.453 --> 04:48.329
if I ran into audience
members they'd be

04:48.330 --> 04:51.332
like, "Jim, you're not that
fat, you're not that fat."

04:51.333 --> 04:53.793
But now after shows people
are like, "Good show."

04:53.794 --> 04:56.796
(audience laughs)

04:56.797 --> 05:00.383
"You nailed it."

05:00.384 --> 05:03.136
I don't care.
I like to eat!

05:03.137 --> 05:05.555
I like to eat.
You know, when you like to eat,

05:05.556 --> 05:08.349
what's weird is people
assume you enjoy cooking.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.934
(audience laughs)

05:09.935 --> 05:13.271
Well, you must know your
way around the kitchen.

05:13.272 --> 05:16.149
I know where the food is.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.359
Well, you must love to cook.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.819
Look, I like to sleep.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.779
It doesn't mean
I wanna build a bed.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.906
(audience laughs)

05:23.907 --> 05:27.076
The truth is, I don't
like to do anything.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.953
Like when I order
delivery, I'm kind

05:28.954 --> 05:32.623
of annoyed they don't
know what I want already.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.752
What, do I have
to do everything?

05:38.797 --> 05:41.632
I did lose some weight
last summer, thank you.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.051
- Thank you.
- (audience applauding)

05:43.052 --> 05:45.219
I did. I did.

05:45.220 --> 05:48.306
Well, I had
my appendix removed.

05:48.307 --> 05:51.142
But it still counts.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.227
I didn't know what
the appendix was,

05:53.228 --> 05:56.272
and since I'm an idiot I
just pretended like I did.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.192
The doctor was like, "We have
to remove your appendix,"

05:59.193 --> 06:03.404
and I was, like,
"Both of them?"

06:03.405 --> 06:04.655
Luckily he thought
I was kidding.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.908
He was, like...
(imitates laughing)

06:06.909 --> 06:07.951
Ah!

06:10.245 --> 06:12.622
I'm so grateful
he didn't call me out.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.082
I don't know what
I would've said, you know?

06:14.083 --> 06:15.875
Like, "There's
only one appendix."

06:15.876 --> 06:21.547
"Oh, ha ha, appendix.
I-- I thought you said lungs.

06:21.548 --> 06:27.136
To me they sound
similar 'cause I'm dumb."

06:27.137 --> 06:29.680
I didn't know what
the appendix was,

06:29.681 --> 06:31.140
but I don't feel that bad.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.267
The doctor told me
science isn't even sure

06:33.268 --> 06:36.020
what the appendix
does exactly.

06:36.021 --> 06:39.482
Science isn't even sure
why the appendix exists.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.442
And I heard that and
I was, like, oh my gosh,

06:41.443 --> 06:45.905
the appendix is
like a Kardashian.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.240
It is.

06:47.241 --> 06:51.744
(audience cheering,
applauding)

06:51.745 --> 06:55.581
Think about it.
It's a mystery to everyone.

06:55.582 --> 06:59.544
But for some of us,
causes excruciating pain.

06:59.545 --> 07:02.547
It needs to be
removed with a knife.

07:02.548 --> 07:05.967
Obviously, I'm not
promoting violence,

07:05.968 --> 07:08.261
against any of
the Kardashians.

07:08.262 --> 07:12.265
Just the mother.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.267
There's always one person
that gets too into that joke.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.477
"Yes, kill the mother.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.730
Kill her and smear
her blood on my face."

07:19.731 --> 07:21.607
(audience laughs)

07:21.608 --> 07:23.067
I think it's strange

07:23.068 --> 07:25.528
science doesn't know
what the appendix does.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.405
That means nobody knows.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.407
You never hear,
"Science doesn't know,

07:29.408 --> 07:32.869
"but Earl has a theory.

07:32.870 --> 07:37.498
Earl, when you were
cleaning the toilet,
you mumbled something."

07:37.499 --> 07:39.500
How is that
an acceptable answer

07:39.501 --> 07:43.254
from the entire
scientific community?

07:43.255 --> 07:47.008
"Yeah, we don't know.

07:47.009 --> 07:51.387
Well, back to
cloning everything."

07:51.388 --> 07:54.515
And they just
remove the appendix.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.392
That's the solution.
Take it out!

07:56.393 --> 07:58.561
We don't know
what it does.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.062
And it's fine.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.772
But you know the first time
they did it,

08:01.773 --> 08:05.027
"We removed your appendix.
Let's see what happens."

08:09.364 --> 08:11.657
I had my appendix
removed in Alaska.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.744
That's not why I went there.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.454
I was on vacation
with my family,

08:16.455 --> 08:18.998
and I had this sharp
pain in my abdomen,

08:18.999 --> 08:21.459
and since I'm a genius,
my first thought was,

08:21.460 --> 08:26.047
"Oh, I pulled a
muscle in my stomach."

08:26.048 --> 08:29.842
That's what
I sincerely thought.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.804
See all these muscles?

08:33.804 --> 08:37.265
I thought I pulled one...

08:37.267 --> 08:40.436
doin' nothin'.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.230
And the pain
was overwhelming.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.773
I couldn't move.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.399
My wife was like,
"I'm gonna go for help,

08:45.400 --> 08:46.567
I'm gonna go for help."

08:46.568 --> 08:48.986
But we're in a
remote area of Alaska

08:48.987 --> 08:51.572
so she just ran
to nearby cabins.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.741
Eventually she came back
all out of breath.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.201
She's like, "I found a guy,
I found a guy."

08:55.202 --> 08:56.869
I was, like, "Oh good,
is he a doctor?"

08:56.870 --> 08:57.870
She goes, "No."

08:57.871 --> 08:58.955
I go, "Is he a nurse?"

08:58.956 --> 09:02.041
She goes, "He's a lawyer."

09:02.042 --> 09:05.920
I guess he can do my will.

09:05.921 --> 09:09.257
So then this
lawyer-doctor came over,

09:09.258 --> 09:10.925
and started
asking me questions,

09:10.926 --> 09:12.969
and when you're in pain
all questions are annoying.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.470
He's like,
"Do you have a fever?"

09:14.471 --> 09:17.640
And I was like,
"Are you even a lawyer?"

09:17.641 --> 09:18.975
He's like,
"Is it a dull pain?"

09:18.976 --> 09:22.770
"There's nothing
boring about this."

09:22.771 --> 09:26.399
Eventually I had to be
airlifted on advice of counsel.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.151
(audience laughs)

09:29.152 --> 09:32.363
I was airlifted,
which was embarrassing,

09:32.364 --> 09:34.740
'cause unlike a heroic
airlift if someone

09:34.741 --> 09:38.119
from a natural disaster
or a wounded solider,

09:38.120 --> 09:40.329
I was just a fat guy
with a tummy ache.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.457
(audience laughs)

09:43.458 --> 09:48.379
The helicopter pilot was like,
"Wait, your stomach hurts?"

09:48.380 --> 09:52.466
"Yeah, it's real sore."

09:52.467 --> 09:55.761
"Do you know how much it
costs to rent a helicopter?"

09:55.762 --> 09:58.056
"But my tummy hurts."

09:59.683 --> 10:01.225
I knew it was expensive.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.352
I sat on that helicopter
the entire ride

10:03.353 --> 10:05.771
just holding my
stomach and praying,

10:05.772 --> 10:08.482
praying, "Please
don't let this be gas."

10:08.483 --> 10:10.735
(audience laughs)

10:10.736 --> 10:14.572
"Sweet Jesus,
don't let this be gas.

10:14.573 --> 10:17.742
'Cause if it's gas
I don't think I can
return to my family."

10:17.743 --> 10:19.535
(audience laughs)

10:19.536 --> 10:20.745
Hey kids, daddy's back.

10:20.746 --> 10:23.331
Had some gas.

10:23.332 --> 10:24.832
Took a helicopter ride.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.626
None of you wanted to
go to college did ya?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.128
It's a little out of
our price range now.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.755
We don't know what
caused the gas.

10:30.756 --> 10:34.258
It might've been daddy's
three breakfast burritos.

10:34.259 --> 10:37.803
Pretty much
a medical mystery.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.847
I was airlifted to
the closest hospital.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.098
They removed my appendix.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.266
They did a good job.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.768
I mean, I'm female now.

10:43.769 --> 10:47.104
(audience laughs)

10:47.105 --> 10:49.357
The surgeon who
removed my appendix,

10:49.358 --> 10:52.902
his name was Dr. Muffuletta.

10:52.903 --> 10:57.782
Which is also the name of a
delicious New Orleans sandwich.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.951
And I do look like a
guy who would know that.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.703
So when he introduced
himself I was like,

11:02.704 --> 11:07.249
am I being visited by
the ghost of sandwich past?

11:07.250 --> 11:09.585
Is Nurse Po'Boy
about to come in?

11:09.586 --> 11:12.630
(audience laughs)

11:12.631 --> 11:15.466
I woke up after the surgery
covered in Mardi Gras beads.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.052
(audience laughs)

11:18.053 --> 11:20.096
No, I woke up and there
was a nurse standing there

11:20.097 --> 11:22.390
and she was like,
"The surgery was a success.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.517
Just let me know if
it hurts when you pee,"

11:24.518 --> 11:26.936
and I was like wait,
where's the appendix?

11:26.937 --> 11:29.063
(audience laughs)

11:29.064 --> 11:32.108
How exactly did you remove it?

11:32.109 --> 11:35.736
This doesn't sound
like a success at all.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.322
Then she explained,
right before the surgery,

11:38.323 --> 11:40.116
they inserted a catheter.

11:40.117 --> 11:43.035
I didn't know what that
was so I was like, "Oh, okay."

11:43.036 --> 11:44.662
And then I started
piecing it together.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.205
It hurts when I pee,
catheter.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.166
I'm suing this hospital!

11:49.167 --> 11:53.129
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer-doctor.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.547
What monsters.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.675
If given a choice of
peeing all over myself,

11:57.676 --> 12:01.220
or having a tube
inserted in my penis...

12:01.221 --> 12:05.516
I'll take the pee shower.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.477
I guess I'm old
fashioned, you know?

12:08.478 --> 12:12.606
(audience cheering,
applauding)

12:12.607 --> 12:15.192
Checking out of the hospital,
the desk clerk was so excited.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.861
He was like, "You had
your appendix removed.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.029
I had my gallbladder
taken out."

12:19.030 --> 12:22.199
I was like, "We should
vacation together.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.993
"What are the odds
two fat Americans

12:23.994 --> 12:27.580
had surgery on their
digestive system?"

12:27.581 --> 12:31.000
I was released from the hospital
the day after the surgery.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.626
They gave me pain killers.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.212
They also instructed
me to do some walking,

12:35.213 --> 12:37.089
which I assume was
part of the recovery,

12:37.090 --> 12:41.469
but it kind of felt like
a commentary on my weight.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.972
"Have you ever
done any walking?

12:44.973 --> 12:46.265
"Have you ever leaned
forward and let

12:46.266 --> 12:50.352
"your legs propel
your fat ass?

12:50.353 --> 12:54.690
Let's take a break from
your motorized scooter."

12:54.691 --> 12:57.193
And I was in Alaska, so
I said this was perfect.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.695
So I returned to my family,
and we immediately

12:59.696 --> 13:01.697
went on a hike
and it was great.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.699
Alaska's beautiful.
My kids were havin' fun.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.495
I was pretending like
I enjoyed being outside.

13:07.496 --> 13:11.040
And then suddenly we saw
a bear, like, 500 yards away,

13:11.041 --> 13:16.420
this huge brown bear, like,
way bigger then a gummy bear.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.589
And I was so excited
'cause I watch nature shows,

13:18.590 --> 13:20.466
but I had never seen
a bear in person

13:20.467 --> 13:22.593
so it felt like
a celebrity sighting.

13:22.594 --> 13:26.222
I was like, "Oh my God, I've
watched you on Animal Planet.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.723
"You're so much taller
in person.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.975
Can we do a selfie?"

13:29.976 --> 13:31.936
But unlike
a celebrity sighting,

13:31.937 --> 13:34.855
there was the risk of death.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.482
Like, you never hear,
we're in restaurant,

13:36.483 --> 13:38.025
Tom Hanks walked in
and then

13:38.026 --> 13:41.445
he came over and
murdered my family.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.198
That never happens.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.200
But the bear was far away,
so I took out

13:46.201 --> 13:48.244
my phone and I started
taking pictures,

13:48.245 --> 13:50.120
and then suddenly
the bear stood up,

13:50.121 --> 13:53.541
roared and looked
right at me.

13:53.542 --> 13:54.959
Started creeping towards me,

13:54.960 --> 13:56.293
tilting his head
back and forth

13:56.294 --> 13:59.964
almost like
he recognized me.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.424
"That guy looks like
Phillip Seymour Hoffman."

14:02.425 --> 14:06.804
(audience cheering,
applauding)

14:06.805 --> 14:09.598
I was terrified.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.517
Luckily, we were
with a tour guide,

14:11.518 --> 14:12.893
and I looked at him
and he goes, "Don't worry,

14:12.894 --> 14:14.436
I have bear spray,"
and I was like,

14:14.437 --> 14:16.855
"Do you have
anything stronger?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.233
"Like a bear gun?

14:19.234 --> 14:20.776
"'Cause I don't think
this bear's

14:20.777 --> 14:23.821
approaching to
get his hair done."

14:23.822 --> 14:26.031
And the bear kept coming,
kept coming,

14:26.032 --> 14:27.783
and then suddenly
the tour guide goes,

14:27.784 --> 14:30.953
"Okay, I want everyone to
start walking backwards slowly.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.122
Walk backwards slowly."

14:33.123 --> 14:37.293
I guess, so the
bear could catch up.

14:37.294 --> 14:39.628
So we started walking
backwards slowly.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.965
By then the bear
was in a full sprint.

14:42.966 --> 14:48.012
I had surgery 12 hours ago,
so I smelled delicious.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.847
I was also sunburned,
so I probably

14:49.848 --> 14:53.851
looked like
a giant land salmon.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.436
The bear couldn't
believe his luck,

14:55.437 --> 14:58.522
like, "I'm not gonna have
to eat for a month."

14:58.523 --> 14:59.732
I was like,
"I'm gonna die!

14:59.733 --> 15:01.358
I'm gonna be
eaten by a bear!"

15:01.359 --> 15:06.196
Which is ironic given how
many animals I've eaten.

15:06.197 --> 15:08.032
So I started humming
"Circle of Life,"

15:08.033 --> 15:11.076
and continued walking
backwards slowly.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.786
I should point out
it's not like

15:12.787 --> 15:15.581
we were walking backwards
slowly to a car or a cabin.

15:15.582 --> 15:19.585
We were walking backwards
slowly to nothing.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.587
It probably looked like
we were teasing the bear

15:21.588 --> 15:25.215
like, "Come
and get it, Mr. Bear.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.886
"Are you looking to
get a little grisly?

15:28.887 --> 15:32.139
Craving a little 2XL
are you?"

15:32.140 --> 15:34.683
And before you knew it
the bear was upon us,

15:34.684 --> 15:37.770
and he killed us
and we died.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.146
Such a bloody mess.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.732
No, what really happened,

15:41.733 --> 15:43.734
is at one point the tour
guide pulled out this thing,

15:43.735 --> 15:45.569
it looked like a pen.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.906
I was like, "Great, he's gonna
ask for the bears autograph."

15:48.907 --> 15:50.741
And I learned later on
it was a bear flare,

15:50.742 --> 15:52.951
and he squeezed it,
and this tiny fire ball

15:52.952 --> 15:55.204
went out towards the bear
and I was like, "Oh good,

15:55.205 --> 15:58.791
something to anger the bear."

15:58.792 --> 16:00.584
The fireball bounced
off the bear.

16:00.585 --> 16:03.587
The bear stopped and then
just ran the other way

16:03.588 --> 16:06.757
like it forgot
something at home.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.134
And we all looked at each
other like, "Oh my gosh,

16:09.135 --> 16:11.178
that just happened,
that just happened."

16:11.179 --> 16:12.721
And that's a true story.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.974
Well, most of that's true.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.769
Well, it's all true
except there was no bear.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.940
(audience cheering,
applauding)

16:24.734 --> 16:28.570
And--

16:28.571 --> 16:31.532
No, there was a bear.

16:31.533 --> 16:35.828
I do sometimes lie up here.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.205
I'm not proud of it.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.957
But sometimes we
all have to lie.

16:39.958 --> 16:43.127
Like, even when I tell
my children not to lie,

16:43.128 --> 16:46.004
I'm kind of lying to them.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.465
Some people are like, "You
should never lie to a child,"

16:48.466 --> 16:51.760
and those people
don't have kids.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.221
'Cause when you have kids,
you lie to them all the time.

16:54.222 --> 16:55.639
You're, like, "You wouldn't
like this ice cream,

16:55.640 --> 16:59.935
"it's very spicy.

16:59.936 --> 17:03.272
"I'd share but
Santa said I can't.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.607
Now why don't you go to sleep
so I can wrestle your mom?"

17:05.608 --> 17:10.945
(audience laughs)

17:10.946 --> 17:12.865
I'm not encouraging lying.

17:12.866 --> 17:16.034
I'm just saying there are
times when you need to, right?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.953
Like if you're late
to meet someone,

17:17.954 --> 17:20.038
and you can see that
they're already angry,

17:20.039 --> 17:23.916
and you don't have an excuse,
you have to lie.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.544
'Cause if you told
that person the truth,

17:25.545 --> 17:28.130
they would never
speak to you again.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.590
You can't be like,
"Hey, I gotta come clean.

17:29.591 --> 17:33.218
I just couldn't
motivate to get goin'."

17:33.219 --> 17:34.970
"I mean,
eventually I could.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.930
What I'm tryin' to say is
I don't value your time."

17:36.931 --> 17:40.559
(audience laughs)

17:40.560 --> 17:42.311
I've identified
there are two times

17:42.312 --> 17:44.897
when it's socially
acceptable to lie.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.357
To spare someone's feelings,
it's okay to lie.

17:47.358 --> 17:50.402
It's also okay to lie
to cover up a murder.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.613
(audience laughs)

17:52.614 --> 17:55.949
Allow me to explain.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.535
When we discover
someone's a murderer,

17:58.536 --> 18:00.829
we also learn they've
done some fibbin'.

18:00.830 --> 18:04.625
But we tend to focus
on the murder part.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.835
You never hear, "I'm angry
he killed that guy,

18:06.836 --> 18:09.630
but frankly I'm more upset
about the lying."

18:09.631 --> 18:13.091
It's the dishonesty
that bothers me.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.136
Some trust has been broken.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.888
Speaking of lying murderers,

18:17.889 --> 18:21.225
I watch a lot of "Dateline."
I don't wanna brag.

18:21.226 --> 18:24.311
Some other winners out there.

18:24.312 --> 18:27.439
If you're unfamiliar or
you have a life, "Dateline" --

18:27.440 --> 18:29.066
(audience laughs)

18:29.067 --> 18:32.110
is a news magazine
show like "60 Minutes,"

18:32.111 --> 18:37.324
but at one point "Dateline"
just went all-in on murder.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.284
And it's usually
spousal murder.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.078
Like if you watch
"Dateline," it appears

18:41.079 --> 18:43.121
most marriages
end in murder.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.750
(audience laughs)

18:46.751 --> 18:48.710
Every episode
starts the same.

18:48.711 --> 18:52.923
They had the perfect
marriage.

18:52.924 --> 18:56.176
But you know someone's
gettin' killed.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.594
A husband, a wife.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.012
Sometimes they'll
get someone else

18:59.013 --> 19:02.266
to kill their spouse,
which seems impersonal.

19:02.267 --> 19:05.853
Like, you took a vow,
do it yourself.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.646
(audience laughs)

19:07.647 --> 19:09.565
Anyway, I was watchin'
this one episode

19:09.566 --> 19:11.441
of "Dateline" about this
guy who murdered his wife.

19:11.442 --> 19:12.860
It was gruesome.

19:12.861 --> 19:17.197
I was watchin' with my
wife on our anniversary.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.824
My wife didn't care.

19:18.825 --> 19:22.160
I mean, she wasn't thrilled
I was taking notes.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.203
"What are you writing down?"

19:23.204 --> 19:26.039
"This guy's just sloppy.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.167
It's like he's
tryin' to get caught."

19:29.168 --> 19:32.379
If anything, this guy's
plan was full proof.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.172
What he did
on his anniversary

19:34.173 --> 19:35.966
is he threw a party
for him and his wife,

19:35.967 --> 19:37.593
and they invited
all their friends

19:37.594 --> 19:39.803
so that they could see
how happy they were,

19:39.804 --> 19:42.306
and then the next morning
he took his wife fishing.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.141
He rented a boat,
he brought a cooler,

19:44.142 --> 19:47.603
some tackle, three
concrete blocks and a tarp.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.521
(audience laughs)

19:49.522 --> 19:52.566
You know, for fishing.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.651
And he woulda gotten
away with the whole thing,

19:54.652 --> 19:58.739
but three months after his
wife disappeared at sea,

19:58.740 --> 20:01.992
he got engaged
to a stripper.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.578
Which is kinda suspicious.

20:04.579 --> 20:06.455
And to celebrate
their engagement,

20:06.456 --> 20:09.166
they dropped acid,
as tradition would have.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.710
(audience laughs)

20:11.711 --> 20:13.795
And while tripping
on acid, he admitted

20:13.796 --> 20:16.590
the whole thing
to his fiance.

20:16.591 --> 20:20.761
And she turned him in
'cause she didn't
appreciate the dishonesty.

20:20.762 --> 20:23.430
(audience laughs)

20:23.431 --> 20:26.225
(audience cheering,
applauding)

20:29.854 --> 20:32.814
And as the episode ended
all I could think is,

20:32.815 --> 20:35.817
"I'm a terrific husband."

20:35.818 --> 20:39.655
I've never even thought
of murdering my wife.

20:39.656 --> 20:44.076
Well, I've never made
plans to murder my wife.

20:44.077 --> 20:47.287
Well, I don't own
concrete blocks.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.414
(audience laughs)

20:49.415 --> 20:51.333
I can see some of
you are like,

20:51.334 --> 20:54.336
"Jim, I don't
like the murder jokes.
I don't like them."

20:54.337 --> 20:55.796
But wouldn't it
be great if

20:55.797 --> 20:59.007
in a week, you learned
I was a murderer?

20:59.008 --> 21:00.384
'Cause then you could brag.

21:00.385 --> 21:01.760
You could be like,
"Oh my gosh,

21:01.761 --> 21:04.304
"we were at the taping
for his special.

21:04.305 --> 21:07.724
And he had all these
jokes on murder."

21:07.725 --> 21:09.017
"Were they good?"

21:09.018 --> 21:11.603
"Not really, no.

21:11.604 --> 21:15.857
He was better at
murder than comedy."

21:15.858 --> 21:17.275
If you know me,
I would do anything

21:17.276 --> 21:19.820
for my wife, and that's
part of my alibi.

21:19.821 --> 21:22.322
No, I--

21:22.323 --> 21:26.034
(audience cheering,
applauding)

21:26.035 --> 21:27.786
I would do anything
for my wife,

21:27.787 --> 21:29.830
but I'm not
a romantic person.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.206
I wish I was.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.916
There are moments when
it's glaringly obvious.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.043
I get to travel so
much during stand up.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.254
I did a show in Cologne,
Germany,

21:37.255 --> 21:39.673
and before the show, I was
walking over this bridge

21:39.674 --> 21:41.216
that went across
the Rhine River,

21:41.217 --> 21:43.218
and as I walked across,
I noticed

21:43.219 --> 21:45.012
there were
hundreds of locks,

21:45.013 --> 21:46.847
hundreds of locks
on this bridge,

21:46.848 --> 21:48.515
and each of the locks
had two initials,

21:48.516 --> 21:50.600
and it was apparent
that couples

21:50.601 --> 21:52.144
had put the lock there

21:52.145 --> 21:54.354
as a symbol
of their relationship,

21:54.355 --> 21:56.565
and I looked at it and
I thought, "That's perfect."

21:56.566 --> 22:01.403
Nothing captures love
like a rusty padlock,

22:01.404 --> 22:05.240
dangling over filthy water.

22:05.241 --> 22:08.702
But it was visually spectacular
and it affected me.

22:08.703 --> 22:10.495
I'm almost embarrassed
to admit this.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.081
I found myself
spending the next hour

22:13.082 --> 22:16.418
just kind of looking
for a hardware store

22:16.419 --> 22:18.086
in this town I
had never been in.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.088
I spent an hour
looking and eventually

22:20.089 --> 22:21.465
I found a hardware store.

22:21.466 --> 22:24.259
I went in and I
bought a bolt cutter.

22:24.260 --> 22:28.680
(audience cheering,
applauding)

22:28.681 --> 22:33.602
And I went back and I started
snipping off the locks.

22:33.603 --> 22:36.772
And with each snip
I said, "It's over.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.441
It's over.
You're free."

22:39.442 --> 22:44.029
And people were
givin' me dirty looks.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.990
What a grand romantic
gesture right?

22:46.991 --> 22:51.995
But, you know the first guy
who did that was a psycho.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.247
Like his partner
or girlfriend was

22:54.248 --> 22:57.084
not a willing participant.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.835
He was like,
"You're probably wondering

22:58.836 --> 23:03.131
"why I brought you to
the middle of the bridge,

23:03.132 --> 23:05.050
"in March.

23:05.051 --> 23:08.595
I'm gonna do something
you'll never ever forget."

23:08.596 --> 23:12.599
She was like, "Oh my gosh,
are you gonna jump?"

23:12.600 --> 23:16.603
"No. I wanna
put this lock here.

23:16.604 --> 23:19.272
"I'll put it here as
a symbol of our love.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.608
"Soon others will do it,
and the bridge

23:21.609 --> 23:23.568
"will be covered with locks.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.862
"But you'll know
that the first lock

23:25.863 --> 23:28.573
was the symbol of our love."

23:28.574 --> 23:32.119
And the woman's like,
"Is that my bike lock?"

23:32.120 --> 23:34.913
(audience laughs)

23:34.914 --> 23:35.872
"Not anymore."

23:35.873 --> 23:39.626
(audience laughs)

23:39.627 --> 23:44.172
"Jim, that's a sad story."

23:44.173 --> 23:47.134
Recently, I was invited to
a surprise birthday party.

23:47.135 --> 23:52.139
It was a surprise
birthday party for a dog.

23:52.140 --> 23:54.975
That's right, I have friends
that are mentally ill.

23:54.976 --> 23:57.352
(audience laughs)

23:57.353 --> 23:59.312
I went, I went. It was in
my apartment building

23:59.313 --> 24:00.939
and I needed the material.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.151
(audience laughs)

24:04.152 --> 24:08.321
And to be fair,
the dog was surprised.

24:08.322 --> 24:10.824
Didn't suspect a thing.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.492
Dog didn't know
it was his birthday.

24:12.493 --> 24:15.245
The dog didn't know
it had a birthday.

24:15.246 --> 24:19.457
The dog wasn't sure why
people were in the apartment.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.168
It was the dog's
third birthday,

24:21.169 --> 24:23.336
which in dog years
doesn't matter.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.463
(audience laughs)

24:25.464 --> 24:27.799
Someone made that up and
we just went along with it.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.093
Oh, one year equals
seven for doggies?

24:30.094 --> 24:31.970
Okay.

24:31.971 --> 24:36.224
When I see a dog,
I'll do math.

24:36.225 --> 24:39.227
That's not fulfilling
some dog need, you know?

24:39.228 --> 24:41.855
There's not a dog sitting
in a bar right now

24:41.856 --> 24:45.650
going, "I'm not three,
I'm 21!

24:45.651 --> 24:49.029
I can legally drink!"

24:49.030 --> 24:52.574
That's not how dogs
keep track of time.

24:52.575 --> 24:55.744
If you have a dog, you know
they don't keep track of time.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.495
You've left your home,
forgotten something,

24:57.496 --> 24:59.289
walked back in
only to be greeted

24:59.290 --> 25:02.375
by your dog like you've
just returned from war.

25:02.376 --> 25:05.545
"You're back!
It's a miracle!

25:05.546 --> 25:09.090
You're back after I don't know
how long 'cause I'm a dog."

25:09.091 --> 25:13.303
(audience laughs)

25:13.304 --> 25:16.181
These poor dogs.

25:16.182 --> 25:20.852
We just attach these points
of view on these poor dogs.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.063
Like dog
is man's best friend.

25:23.064 --> 25:26.316
How desperate are humans?

25:26.317 --> 25:28.985
We're best friends, right?

25:28.986 --> 25:32.948
Dog's like, "Well, aren't
we different species?"

25:32.949 --> 25:34.449
"But we're
best friends forever."

25:34.450 --> 25:39.162
"You know you lock me
in the house all day,

25:39.163 --> 25:42.499
"with nothing but
a bowl of water.

25:42.500 --> 25:46.586
You'd think you'd let your
best friend sit on the couch."

25:46.587 --> 25:48.713
"We're best friends. Now
put on this fireman's outfit.

25:48.714 --> 25:52.592
We're gonna do a photo
shoot for Instagram."

25:52.593 --> 25:54.094
"You know sometimes
when you sleep,

25:54.095 --> 25:55.553
I think about
eating your face."

25:55.554 --> 25:58.266
(audience laughs)

26:01.894 --> 26:03.645
But I get it.
I love dogs too.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.480
I love animals.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.065
We all have a friend
that announces

26:07.066 --> 26:09.192
they love animals
in a way that implies

26:09.193 --> 26:12.320
the rest of us
are drowning kittens.

26:12.321 --> 26:15.824
"Yeah, but I love animals."

26:15.825 --> 26:17.742
Well, that's a pretty
exclusive group

26:17.743 --> 26:22.205
of just you and anyone
who's not a serial killer.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.541
"Yeah, but I just get
along with animals better."

26:24.542 --> 26:26.668
Or humans don't like you.

26:26.669 --> 26:30.964
(audience laughs)

26:30.965 --> 26:33.091
I did have
an opportunity to

26:33.092 --> 26:35.343
go on a safari,
which was unbelievable.

26:35.344 --> 26:38.138
It was breathtaking
how bad the wifi was.

26:38.139 --> 26:40.849
(audience laughs)

26:40.850 --> 26:42.475
I went on a safari
which is just

26:42.476 --> 26:46.187
a fancy word
for animal stalking.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.564
'Cause that's what
you do on a safari.

26:47.565 --> 26:49.399
You follow animals
and watch them.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.110
You're like...

26:58.075 --> 26:59.117
Beautiful.

26:59.118 --> 27:02.620
(audience laughs)

27:02.621 --> 27:04.331
It's a good thing
these animals

27:04.332 --> 27:07.334
can't report us
to the police.

27:07.335 --> 27:10.086
"Yeah, officer, that fat
guy in the untucked shirt

27:10.087 --> 27:14.758
"followed me for an
hour this morning.

27:14.759 --> 27:18.053
"I woke up and he was taking
pictures of me and my family.

27:18.054 --> 27:20.764
(audience laughs)

27:20.765 --> 27:23.767
"We were naked.

27:23.768 --> 27:25.810
Yeah, the guy who looks like
Phillip Seymour Hoffman."

27:25.811 --> 27:29.647
(audience laughs)

27:29.648 --> 27:32.734
On the safari, I saw one
animal kill another animal,

27:32.735 --> 27:34.652
and intellectually I was,
like, I don't wanna see that,

27:34.653 --> 27:38.323
but emotionally in the
moment I was like, "Get him."

27:38.324 --> 27:41.242
"Kill it!"

27:41.243 --> 27:43.620
My kids were totally
savage about it.

27:43.621 --> 27:46.998
They're like, "Kill him,
kill him! I want blood."

27:46.999 --> 27:48.583
My kids were with me.

27:48.584 --> 27:53.129
My kids were poorly
behaved on a safari.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.589
They're six and seven,

27:54.590 --> 27:56.633
and animals would walk by
like, "Savages."

27:56.634 --> 27:59.010
(audience laughs)

27:59.011 --> 28:01.763
My two youngest are six
and seven year old boys,

28:01.764 --> 28:03.932
and they're total savages.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.600
They're constantly
picking on me.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.727
They're jumping on me
and they pick on me.

28:07.728 --> 28:10.271
How they pick on me recently
is they make fun of my,

28:10.272 --> 28:12.899
what they call
my huge boy part.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.568
(audience laughs)

28:15.569 --> 28:18.738
Now before you think I'm
walking around the house naked,

28:18.739 --> 28:22.826
or in fact
have a huge boy part,

28:22.827 --> 28:25.620
you should know that, like,
when you have young sons,

28:25.621 --> 28:28.415
you have to constantly
encourage them to
use the bathroom,

28:28.416 --> 28:30.458
and if you're a dad,
sometimes you pee with them,

28:30.459 --> 28:33.461
so that's why they've
seen my boy part.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.004
But that doesn't
explain why sometimes

28:35.005 --> 28:36.673
at dinner, they'll
just point at me

28:36.674 --> 28:41.136
and giggle, and go,
"Dad and his huge boy part."

28:41.137 --> 28:42.429
I never know what to say.

28:42.430 --> 28:45.765
I'm like, "Guilty."

28:45.766 --> 28:47.851
"Got me again.
Did you hear that honey?"

28:47.852 --> 28:50.563
(audience laughs)

28:57.194 --> 28:58.653
Lovely weather out there.

28:58.654 --> 29:00.447
(audience laughs)

29:00.448 --> 29:02.532
I prefer the cold to hot.
I do.

29:02.533 --> 29:04.451
I know that's surprising
looking at me,

29:04.452 --> 29:07.078
given I look like a snowman.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.955
(audience cheering,
applauding)

29:08.956 --> 29:10.623
But I prefer
the cold you know?

29:10.624 --> 29:12.625
Last summer
I was in Las Vegas.

29:12.626 --> 29:15.462
It was 114 degrees.

29:15.463 --> 29:17.297
114 degrees.

29:17.298 --> 29:20.008
You can actually hear
the sun at that point.

29:20.009 --> 29:22.760
(imitates sun crackling)

29:22.761 --> 29:24.512
It didn't feel safe.

29:24.513 --> 29:28.475
I was, like, "Are we
supposed to be here?"

29:28.476 --> 29:30.143
114-- Like, you're never
at a friends house

29:30.144 --> 29:31.561
and, "Warm in here."

29:31.562 --> 29:35.231
"Yeah, I set the
thermostat to 114.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.775
That's how I like it.
I'm part lizard."

29:37.776 --> 29:40.278
(audience laughs)

29:40.279 --> 29:42.197
Thermostats don't
even go up that high.

29:42.198 --> 29:46.159
Meat thermometers do.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.120
I think God is just
cooking people in Vegas.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.663
(imitates sun crackling)

29:50.664 --> 29:52.999
"Ooh, that one's smoking.
I love smoked meat."

29:53.000 --> 29:55.502
(imitates sun crackling)

29:55.503 --> 29:59.088
It was 114 degrees,
which was shocking,

29:59.089 --> 30:02.592
but not as shocking as how
casually Las Vegas residents

30:02.593 --> 30:04.636
just went about their
day in that heat.

30:04.637 --> 30:05.970
It was like...
(imitates sun crackling)

30:05.971 --> 30:07.347
They were like,
"Let's play Frisbee.

30:07.348 --> 30:08.556
Time to walk the dog."

30:08.557 --> 30:11.476
I was like, "Get inside!

30:11.477 --> 30:14.395
"The Earth is on fire!

30:14.396 --> 30:18.525
"Get inside and beg
for God's forgiveness.

30:18.526 --> 30:22.195
You've obviously angered him!"

30:22.196 --> 30:24.239
That's why Vegas
is called Sin City,

30:24.240 --> 30:28.201
it's the same
temperature as Hell.

30:28.202 --> 30:30.036
I have a friend
from Vegas.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.162
I told him it was 114.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.539
He goes, "That's nothin'."

30:32.540 --> 30:35.250
I'm like,
"No, that's somethin'.

30:35.251 --> 30:38.461
That's actually the
temperature you boil water at."

30:38.462 --> 30:42.549
He's, like, "It's not that bad."
"Not if you're makin' Ramen."

30:42.550 --> 30:44.092
He's, like,
"That's our summer."

30:44.093 --> 30:45.969
That's not summer.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.887
Summer is when you
barbecue on the grill,

30:47.888 --> 30:50.265
not the side walk.

30:50.266 --> 30:53.726
It's so weird to be places
where summer is the enemy.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.937
I was, like, in the
southwest, they talk

30:55.938 --> 30:57.605
about summer like
it's an ex lover

30:57.606 --> 30:59.691
they never wanna see again.

30:59.692 --> 31:04.195
"We gotta get outta here
before summer gets here.

31:04.196 --> 31:08.616
Last year, I couldn't leave my
house when summer was here."

31:08.617 --> 31:10.577
You ever notice the
further north you go,

31:10.578 --> 31:12.787
the more obsessed
people are with summer?

31:12.788 --> 31:15.707
Like I-- In February,
I was in Bangor, Maine,

31:15.708 --> 31:17.625
and everyone was
talking about summer.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.836
Everyone I met, they're
like, "You gotta come
back during summer.

31:19.837 --> 31:21.963
You gotta come back."

31:21.964 --> 31:23.715
Which is a strange
way to greet someone.

31:23.716 --> 31:25.425
"Hi, how are ya?
Come back later."

31:25.426 --> 31:28.511
(audience laughs)

31:28.512 --> 31:29.846
And it was everyone.

31:29.847 --> 31:31.139
"You gotta come
back during summer,

31:31.140 --> 31:34.017
you gotta, I'm--"
"Yeah but I'm here now."

31:34.018 --> 31:35.893
"Just make sure
you come back."

31:35.894 --> 31:37.770
"I didn't wanna
come the first time."

31:37.771 --> 31:39.814
(audience laughs)

31:39.815 --> 31:42.233
But I love how northern
cities sell summer.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.193
Like, "Summer here's
unbelievable.

31:44.194 --> 31:47.780
It's perfect. For one twelfth
of the year it's ideal.

31:47.781 --> 31:49.198
"Otherwise
it's a tundra filled

31:49.199 --> 31:52.577
"with alcoholism
and depression.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.955
But for those 13 odd
days it's worth it."

31:55.956 --> 31:58.124
(audience laughs, cheers)

31:58.125 --> 32:01.127
I did nothing today.

32:01.128 --> 32:02.837
Didn't feel any
pressure to do anything.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.881
Some places you feel like
a pressure to do something,

32:04.882 --> 32:07.508
like St. Louis,
"You gotta go see our arch."

32:07.509 --> 32:09.594
"I don't want to."

32:09.595 --> 32:11.596
"Go look at our arch."

32:11.597 --> 32:16.142
"Why don't I just go
McDonald's and see two?"

32:16.143 --> 32:18.436
San Antonio, "You
gotta go to the Alamo."

32:18.437 --> 32:20.730
"I was gonna nap."

32:20.731 --> 32:22.732
"No, you're gonna stand
outside in blistering heat

32:22.733 --> 32:24.817
and look at a building."

32:24.818 --> 32:29.030
"Can't I just say
I forgot about the Alamo?"

32:29.031 --> 32:31.199
You know who didn't
wanna go to the Alamo?

32:31.200 --> 32:33.576
The people who
died at the Alamo.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.078
I bet their
last thought was,

32:35.079 --> 32:36.996
"I wish I didn't
go to the Alamo.

32:36.997 --> 32:40.541
I thought it was a
rental car company."

32:40.542 --> 32:43.211
Can you imagine
that level of bravery?

32:43.212 --> 32:47.131
187 Texans fought
2,000 of Santa Anna's

32:47.132 --> 32:49.717
finest Mexican troops
and at one point

32:49.718 --> 32:51.969
those 180 Texans
just decided,

32:51.970 --> 32:54.639
"We should just fight
'til we all die."

32:54.640 --> 32:56.307
Like, if I was there
I would've been like,

32:56.308 --> 32:58.559
"Excuse me.
I love the idea of Texas too,

32:58.560 --> 33:03.314
"but have you tried
this Mexican food?

33:03.315 --> 33:07.652
"It is delicioso.

33:07.653 --> 33:11.864
I propose we remember
the guacamole."

33:11.865 --> 33:15.660
Of course Vegas, the big
assignment is to gamble.

33:15.661 --> 33:18.121
Nobody every admits
they gamble when
they go to Las Vegas.

33:18.122 --> 33:19.872
"You goin' to Vegas,
you gonna gamble?"

33:19.873 --> 33:22.041
"No, I'm gonna see shows."

33:22.042 --> 33:23.334
"You're not gonna
gamble at all?"

33:23.335 --> 33:25.169
"Well, if I walk by
a poker table

33:25.170 --> 33:29.882
"I might sit down
and lose $10,000.

33:29.883 --> 33:33.469
I'm mainly going
for the shows."

33:33.470 --> 33:35.471
We don't like to
admit we gamble.
People never admit it.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.140
They're like,
"I'm not gambling,

33:37.141 --> 33:39.142
"I'm just pulling this lever.
I like to pull levers.

33:39.143 --> 33:40.852
"It's a good arm workout.

33:40.853 --> 33:43.020
"I'm not gambling, I'm just
watching these horses run

33:43.021 --> 33:45.940
and letting the winner
determine if I keep my home."

33:45.941 --> 33:48.192
(audience laughs)

33:48.193 --> 33:50.695
We are country that
loves to bet on horses.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.739
Every spring,
we track the three races

33:52.740 --> 33:54.073
of the Triple Crown,
and every spring

33:54.074 --> 33:55.283
I always have
the same thought.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.660
We're still doing this?

33:57.661 --> 34:00.997
Is Woodrow Wilson president?

34:00.998 --> 34:02.707
But people love
the Triple Crown.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.168
The Kentucky Derby,
where people bet on horses

34:05.169 --> 34:09.045
while they're dressed
like characters from
"Gone with the Wind."

34:09.047 --> 34:12.341
It's like prom for gamblers.

34:12.342 --> 34:13.842
"Do you like my hat?

34:13.844 --> 34:15.553
I'm living in
my sisters garage."

34:15.554 --> 34:17.889
(audience laughs)

34:17.889 --> 34:21.184
"'Cause I have a debilitating
gambling addiction.

34:21.185 --> 34:25.103
Shall we have
another mint julep?"

34:25.105 --> 34:26.688
They always
announce the winner

34:26.690 --> 34:27.982
of each race on the news.

34:27.983 --> 34:29.400
You can always tell the horse

34:29.400 --> 34:31.235
was named by a guy
on his eighth wife.

34:31.235 --> 34:35.822
The horse is always named
like Viagra's Revenge.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.659
Alimony Be Damned.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.953
They show a picture of the
winning horse on the news.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.580
They could show us
a picture of any horse,

34:42.581 --> 34:44.873
we wouldn't
know the difference.

34:44.875 --> 34:47.168
I don't know
what we're supposed
to do with that horse image.

34:47.168 --> 34:51.255
It's not like we're gonna
run into that horse in a bar.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.592
"Excuse me, did you win
the Kentucky Derby?"

34:54.592 --> 34:57.720
"I did,
I won the Kentucky Derby.

34:57.721 --> 35:01.557
Now I'm in a bar,
enjoying a Heiferweizen."

35:01.558 --> 35:04.602
There is the classic photo
of the winning horse right?

35:04.603 --> 35:06.687
They're always wearing
that huge horseshoe

35:06.688 --> 35:10.817
wreath of flowers they stole
from someone's grave site.

35:10.818 --> 35:12.568
Standing next to
the winning horse

35:12.569 --> 35:15.029
is the owner of the horse,
who did not train the horse,

35:15.030 --> 35:17.740
did not ride the horse,
and based on body language

35:17.741 --> 35:20.660
has never really
met the horse.

35:20.661 --> 35:26.165
There the owner stands,
looking like they've
never paid taxes.

35:26.166 --> 35:28.125
Sitting on top of
the winning horse

35:28.126 --> 35:29.585
is the jockey,
who's dressed like

35:29.586 --> 35:33.840
he just came from
a local pride parade.

35:33.841 --> 35:36.259
They always interview the
jockey expecting some insight.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.969
They're like, "How'd you win?"

35:37.970 --> 35:40.137
The jockey's like, "I whipped
the horse and it ran."

35:40.138 --> 35:42.139
(audience laughs)

35:42.140 --> 35:44.308
It's very rare
for a horse to win

35:44.309 --> 35:45.935
all three races in
the Triple Crown,

35:45.936 --> 35:50.565
mainly 'cause they're
horses and they don't care.

35:50.566 --> 35:54.443
Mostly they just want someone
to stop whipping them,

35:54.444 --> 35:56.571
'cause they're horses.

35:56.572 --> 35:57.989
I didn't know this.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.199
After the Triple Crown,
all those horses retire.

36:00.200 --> 36:03.202
They retire
at the age of three.

36:03.203 --> 36:05.580
It feels early.

36:05.581 --> 36:07.540
They retire and then
they're sent out to stud.

36:07.541 --> 36:10.042
Those horses get
paid to have sex,

36:10.043 --> 36:14.213
which in some ways is better
than winning the Triple Crown.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.924
That's like
the quadruple crown.

36:16.925 --> 36:19.135
That's gotta be an
adjustment for those horses.

36:19.136 --> 36:20.678
Like, "Hey, remember
when we whipped you

36:20.679 --> 36:22.054
"and we wanted you to run?

36:22.055 --> 36:24.432
"Well, now when we
whip you, we're gonna

36:24.433 --> 36:26.392
have you do something
a little different."

36:26.393 --> 36:29.770
(audience laughs)

36:29.771 --> 36:33.190
"How many horse jokes
is this guy gonna do?

36:33.191 --> 36:37.194
I never thought
I'd miss a murder joke."

36:37.195 --> 36:40.156
There's a lot more
horse jokes.

36:40.157 --> 36:43.910
And if you haven't noticed,
I know nothing about horses.

36:43.911 --> 36:46.662
I don't horseback ride
mainly because

36:46.663 --> 36:52.293
I prefer to be comfortable,
and it's not the 1800's.

36:52.294 --> 36:54.086
I'm sure the horses
aren't thrilled either.

36:54.087 --> 36:55.630
They're like, "Why am I
carrying you around?

36:55.631 --> 36:58.633
I saw you drive up
in a Honda Civic?"

36:58.634 --> 37:02.303
(audience cheering,
applauding)

37:02.304 --> 37:04.013
But people like
to horseback ride.

37:04.014 --> 37:05.932
I have a friend,
she told me the reason

37:05.933 --> 37:08.351
she enjoys horseback riding
is 'cause she loves horses

37:08.352 --> 37:10.269
which seems like
a strange way

37:10.270 --> 37:12.688
of expressing love
for something.

37:12.689 --> 37:15.983
Making it carry you
around on its back.

37:15.984 --> 37:18.110
I mean I love my
Great Aunt Katie.

37:18.111 --> 37:20.488
(audience laughs)

37:20.489 --> 37:24.283
I'm not gonna make her
carry me around on her back.

37:24.284 --> 37:25.326
Not anymore, yeah.

37:25.327 --> 37:27.536
(audience laughs)

37:27.537 --> 37:29.163
I don't even know why
we have to specify

37:29.164 --> 37:31.749
that it's horse-back riding.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.377
(audience laughs)

37:34.378 --> 37:36.170
Are there people like,
"Hey, you wanna ride a horse?

37:36.171 --> 37:38.422
What part?"

37:38.423 --> 37:41.676
(audience laughs)

37:41.677 --> 37:45.554
"The part that looks
like a seat, the back."

37:45.555 --> 37:49.100
"Oh good, 'cause I've
done horse-ass riding.

37:49.101 --> 37:51.102
That was painful,
I kept fallin' off."

37:51.103 --> 37:53.479
(audience laughs)

37:53.480 --> 37:55.064
I should probably tell you,

37:55.065 --> 37:57.358
the rest of the show
is all horse jokes.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.110
(audience cheering,
applauding)

37:59.111 --> 38:02.488
(gasps)
"Is he serious?"

38:02.489 --> 38:04.866
(audience cheering,
applauding)

38:07.327 --> 38:09.620
There are different
types of horses.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.873
(audience laughs)

38:13.208 --> 38:15.960
"He's gonna
keep going isn't he?"

38:15.961 --> 38:18.295
No, there are breeds
of horses, right?

38:18.296 --> 38:20.214
Which is different
from horse breeding.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.258
I don't know if you've ever
seen two horses breed,

38:22.259 --> 38:24.927
but that'll keep you
awake at night.

38:24.928 --> 38:29.056
If you've never
seen two horses breed,
do not YouTube it.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.559
Do not YouTube it and
print out still images.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.185
Don't do that.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.979
Don't affix your face
on one of the images

38:34.980 --> 38:36.188
and show your wife
and think it's funny.

38:36.189 --> 38:38.524
She won't think it's funny.

38:38.525 --> 38:42.194
But that says more
about her then you.

38:42.195 --> 38:43.279
What was I talkin' about?

38:43.280 --> 38:45.740
Horses.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.616
It's strange how
we treat horses.

38:47.617 --> 38:49.035
We give horses shoes.

38:49.036 --> 38:51.912
I don't even know
if horses need shoes.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.749
You never seen a horse in the
wild walking around like, "Ow!

38:54.750 --> 38:56.459
"Ow!

38:56.460 --> 38:59.879
I wish I had some damn shoes!"

38:59.880 --> 39:02.506
We give horses shoes
that are metal.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.591
Metal.

39:03.592 --> 39:07.678
That's worse then Crocs.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.722
That must be hard
to shop for right?

39:09.723 --> 39:11.640
"Do you have anything in
metal but not a slip on?

39:11.641 --> 39:14.810
Something I can
nail to my foot."

39:14.811 --> 39:19.065
That's what we do,
we nail it to their foot!

39:19.066 --> 39:21.400
And when we're not doing
that, we're literally

39:21.401 --> 39:25.196
tossing the horseshoe
around as a game.

39:25.197 --> 39:29.700
The horse must be like,
"What the hell are you
doin' with my shoes?

39:29.701 --> 39:31.869
It probably looks like
we're taunting the horse.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.747
"Hey, horse, why don't you
come and get your shoes?

39:34.748 --> 39:36.415
"Why don't you go and grab it?

39:36.416 --> 39:40.211
Oh, you can't, 'cause
you don't have hands!"

39:40.212 --> 39:45.925
The horse shoe,
a symbol of luck for
everyone but the horse.

39:45.926 --> 39:47.635
I don't know
if this is true.

39:47.636 --> 39:49.553
Someone told me that when
horses are sent out to stud,

39:49.554 --> 39:53.808
some female horses will
wear high heel horse shoes.

39:53.809 --> 39:55.267
Makes them more confident.

39:55.268 --> 39:58.562
"I'm gonna be payin'
for this later on.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.689
Oh, and I've been
on my feet all day."

40:00.690 --> 40:03.485
(audience laughs)

40:05.320 --> 40:08.989
"That's gotta be the
end of the horse jokes."

40:08.990 --> 40:11.242
Horse people,

40:11.243 --> 40:12.785
and I'm not
talkin' about people

40:12.786 --> 40:15.621
that are half-horse,
half-human,

40:15.622 --> 40:18.916
which are centaur's
and they don't exist...

40:18.917 --> 40:21.418
anymore, right?

40:21.419 --> 40:23.504
No, people who own
horses will tell you

40:23.505 --> 40:26.632
that the horse can't even feel
the nail going in their foot.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.634
Not that anyone's ever
heard a horse go,

40:28.635 --> 40:30.928
"That's fine, hammer away.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.556
Next time glue,
just don't tell me where
you got the glue from."

40:33.557 --> 40:36.392
(audience laughs)

40:36.393 --> 40:39.562
Oh, that was too edgy?

40:39.563 --> 40:42.982
There's no horses in here.

40:42.983 --> 40:44.608
There's not a horse
in the front row goin',

40:44.609 --> 40:47.945
"Hey, take it easy on
the glue jokes. I'm gonna--"

40:47.946 --> 40:49.321
I love how some of you
look for it.

40:49.322 --> 40:50.990
"Is there a horse out there?"

40:50.991 --> 40:52.742
(audience laughs)

40:56.621 --> 40:59.915
It's strange how we
treat horses, you know?

40:59.916 --> 41:01.667
The most shocking way
how we treat horses

41:01.668 --> 41:05.921
is when they break
their leg, we shoot them.

41:05.922 --> 41:09.216
That's a harsh medical plan.

41:09.217 --> 41:10.885
And someone explained
the reason

41:10.886 --> 41:12.761
they shoot horses when
they break their leg

41:12.762 --> 41:14.597
is 'cause it's
unlikely the leg

41:14.598 --> 41:17.099
will heal properly,
and I was like, unlikely?

41:17.100 --> 41:19.476
So there's a chance?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.979
Can you imagine how
stressed out horses must be?

41:21.980 --> 41:23.439
Like, "I stepped on a branch.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.150
"It was a branch,
put down the gun!

41:26.151 --> 41:27.568
Look at the branch,
it's a branch!"

41:27.569 --> 41:29.111
Even if they're
injured they're like,

41:29.112 --> 41:31.488
"I'll walk it off,
I'm gonna walk it off.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.531
"Put the gun down, jeez.

41:32.532 --> 41:35.117
"You guys, anyone?

41:35.118 --> 41:36.410
"Have you ever
heard of Ben Gay?

41:36.411 --> 41:38.245
What's goin' on?
Put down the gun!"

41:38.246 --> 41:41.041
(audience laughs)

41:44.002 --> 41:47.254
I can see on
some of your faces,

41:47.255 --> 41:50.966
that you would frankly prefer
if I did more horse jokes.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.801
(audience laughs)

41:52.802 --> 41:57.182
(audience cheering,
applauding)

42:01.436 --> 42:02.728
Okay.

42:02.729 --> 42:04.396
(audience laughs)

42:04.397 --> 42:06.982
It's odd, how we
treat horses 'cause

42:06.983 --> 42:08.651
we live in this
era where we treat

42:08.652 --> 42:11.403
our dogs and cats
as family members.

42:11.404 --> 42:13.656
People are always trying to
get their dog on an airplane.

42:13.657 --> 42:15.241
You know it's just
a matter of time

42:15.242 --> 42:17.618
before someone brings
a horse on a plane.

42:17.619 --> 42:20.579
"Are you kidding me?

42:20.580 --> 42:23.874
"This is my therapy horse.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.752
He keeps me calm
on the flight."

42:26.753 --> 42:31.048
"We'd like to welcome
our Silver Medallion
members to board.

42:31.049 --> 42:34.969
"And anyone traveling
with a farm animal,

42:34.970 --> 42:37.638
"you can board at Gate 47.

42:37.639 --> 42:40.307
Feel free to grab some
sugar cubes that we've..."

42:40.308 --> 42:43.103
(audience laughs)

42:46.564 --> 42:48.816
Horse power.

42:48.817 --> 42:49.985
(audience laughs)

42:52.195 --> 42:56.115
Horse power is so
different from girl power.

42:56.116 --> 42:59.285
Do you know what I mean?
It's like, "You go, horse!"

42:59.286 --> 43:02.204
Hey!

43:02.205 --> 43:04.164
Hay is what horses eat.

43:04.165 --> 43:06.918
(audience laughs)

43:08.503 --> 43:10.379
Okay, I can tell at this point

43:10.380 --> 43:14.216
there's probably one
or two, or 300 of you,

43:14.217 --> 43:16.635
that are frankly annoyed
by the horse jokes.

43:16.636 --> 43:18.512
(audience laughs)

43:18.513 --> 43:20.389
And I want you to know that

43:20.390 --> 43:23.183
your annoyance
gives me pleasure.

43:23.184 --> 43:24.685
(audience laughs)

43:24.686 --> 43:29.607
(audience cheering,
applauding)

43:31.693 --> 43:33.444
All right, you know what?
That's, that's--

43:33.445 --> 43:35.612
No more horse jokes.
I promise, I promise.

43:35.613 --> 43:38.449
All right?
Anyway, um...

43:38.450 --> 43:40.743
ponies...

43:40.744 --> 43:42.036
are completely different.

43:42.037 --> 43:44.204
(audience laughs)

43:44.205 --> 43:45.497
Here's the problem with doing

43:45.498 --> 43:48.625
roughly 10 minutes
of horse jokes.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.294
Besides the audience
hating you

43:50.295 --> 43:52.379
for the rest
of their lives.

43:52.380 --> 43:54.465
It's for the next
couple minutes

43:54.466 --> 43:56.550
you will all be like,
"Is there a horse joke comin'?"

43:56.551 --> 43:58.844
(audience laughs)

43:58.845 --> 44:02.306
Or you're gonna be
like, "He coulda put a
horse joke in there.

44:02.307 --> 44:03.807
"He didn't use the
reference 'giddy up.'

44:03.808 --> 44:06.435
Why wouldn't he
put it in there?"

44:06.436 --> 44:09.521
But I want you to put
the horse jokes aside.

44:09.522 --> 44:12.608
Put them in a barn.

44:12.609 --> 44:14.527
And I'm gonna talk
about something else.

44:17.072 --> 44:18.864
Maybe.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.366
No, it's over.

44:20.367 --> 44:23.243
I-- You know,
as I mentioned earlier

44:23.244 --> 44:24.870
I did some shows
in Europe and I only

44:24.871 --> 44:28.665
bring that up to
try and impress you.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.459
But I flew over.

44:30.460 --> 44:34.004
Really the only way to
get across the Atlantic.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.798
You rarely run into someone
who's like, "You know what?

44:35.799 --> 44:38.967
I paddle boarded.
It was a great arm workout."

44:38.968 --> 44:42.596
I flew over.
That transatlantic flight
wipes people out.

44:42.597 --> 44:44.306
People are a mess.

44:44.307 --> 44:46.892
They're like, "I need a day.
I need a day."

44:46.893 --> 44:49.103
The flight doesn't
sound that hard.

44:49.104 --> 44:50.562
It's like, "Oh, it was brutal.

44:50.563 --> 44:53.440
"I had to sit and
watch two movies.

44:53.441 --> 44:56.819
"I felt like I was
being water boarded.

44:56.820 --> 44:58.445
I need a day."

44:58.446 --> 45:02.032
I was flying back,
3,000 miles, seven hours.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.700
We landed.
The guy sitting next to me

45:03.701 --> 45:06.203
was like,
"That took too long."

45:06.204 --> 45:11.041
It used to take six weeks,

45:11.042 --> 45:13.168
on a boat,

45:13.169 --> 45:16.296
if you survived.

45:16.297 --> 45:17.965
That's how long it
took Columbus to get

45:17.966 --> 45:20.968
from Spain to the western
hemisphere, six weeks.

45:20.969 --> 45:22.928
But you know, once Columbus
got here he was like,

45:22.929 --> 45:26.807
"I need a day.
I am so boat-lagged.

45:26.808 --> 45:28.100
"Give me a day and
I'll get right down

45:28.101 --> 45:30.894
to murdering
and plundering."

45:30.895 --> 45:34.523
"Jim don't bring up Columbus,
you're too white."

45:34.524 --> 45:36.692
But Columbus, that's part
of our history right?

45:36.693 --> 45:38.152
Columbus ushered
in all these people

45:38.153 --> 45:40.070
that came to the
western hemisphere,

45:40.071 --> 45:41.905
and some of them
did bad things.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.491
But humans have done bad
things throughout the world.

45:44.492 --> 45:47.119
Like in Australia the way
some of the settlers

45:47.120 --> 45:49.079
treated the aboriginals,
it was not nice.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.206
It was not a g'day.

45:51.207 --> 45:53.208
(audience laughs)

45:53.209 --> 45:56.086
In fact it was a series
of bad days or bidet's.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.088
(audience laughs)

45:58.089 --> 46:00.757
In New Zealand,
the settlers shared

46:00.758 --> 46:02.843
the land with the native
people, the Maori people,

46:02.844 --> 46:05.053
a very noble
warrior-like people,

46:05.054 --> 46:07.097
but the Maori weren't even the
first people in New Zealand.

46:07.098 --> 46:09.349
The first people in New
Zealand were the Moriori

46:09.350 --> 46:13.187
and then the Maori
came and ate them.

46:13.188 --> 46:15.772
Not even makin' that up.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.566
That's the most
intimidating thing

46:17.567 --> 46:20.027
you could do to
your enemy, right?

46:20.028 --> 46:21.612
Like, "Oh, you're
gonna kill me?"

46:21.613 --> 46:23.864
"Yeah, and then I'm gonna
grab some mayonnaise."

46:23.865 --> 46:26.033
(audience laughs)

46:26.034 --> 46:28.827
"What are you gonna d-- Oh!"

46:28.828 --> 46:32.164
Could you imagine those initial
English settlers in New Zealand?

46:32.165 --> 46:34.541
'Cause the British
had conquered the world.

46:34.542 --> 46:35.959
They had colonies
on every continent

46:35.960 --> 46:37.586
so by the time they
got to New Zealand

46:37.587 --> 46:39.046
they were like,
"We've done this before.

46:39.047 --> 46:41.006
Let's meet with the
locals and take over."

46:41.007 --> 46:42.966
So they met with the Maori
and they're like,

46:42.967 --> 46:44.885
"So what happened to
these Moriori people,
did you kill them?"

46:44.886 --> 46:47.012
And they're like,
"Yeah, and then we ate them."

46:47.013 --> 46:48.805
The English were like,
"We were thinkin'

46:48.806 --> 46:51.934
"we could share the islands.

46:51.935 --> 46:54.686
"You wanna share?
You're not hungry now are you?

46:54.687 --> 46:56.313
"You know what?
Get 'em some shepherds pie.

46:56.314 --> 46:58.273
Tell 'em it's made
out of shepherds."

46:58.274 --> 47:01.235
(audience laughs)

47:01.236 --> 47:04.488
"Jim even makes
colonialism about eating."

47:04.489 --> 47:05.865
(audience laughs)

47:07.909 --> 47:09.535
They were cannibals.
By the way,

47:09.536 --> 47:12.329
at one time, all human
civilizations were cannibal,

47:12.330 --> 47:14.414
which means back then it
meant something different

47:14.415 --> 47:17.417
when someone said,
"I'm craving Indian or Thai."

47:17.418 --> 47:21.046
(audience laughs)

47:21.047 --> 47:26.635
I can see how you
wanna be offended,
but there's no reason.

47:26.636 --> 47:28.095
When I was in Europe,
I tried all

47:28.096 --> 47:30.013
the local specialties,
you know?

47:30.014 --> 47:31.848
Norway, I tried
reindeer meat.

47:31.849 --> 47:34.476
I was in a Norwegian
butcher shop in January,

47:34.477 --> 47:36.353
and they had a sale
on reindeer meat,

47:36.354 --> 47:38.897
and nothing says
Christmas season is over,

47:38.898 --> 47:41.817
(audience laughs)

47:41.818 --> 47:44.861
quite like a sale
on reindeer meat.

47:44.862 --> 47:48.365
It's gotta be a
tough day for Santa.

47:48.366 --> 47:50.784
"I wanna thank all you reindeer
who helped this Christmas.

47:50.785 --> 47:54.621
"Great job.
Now when I call your name,

47:54.622 --> 47:56.873
come with me into
the smokehouse."

47:56.874 --> 47:59.710
(audience laughs)

47:59.711 --> 48:01.503
France, I ate so much cheese.

48:01.504 --> 48:03.630
So much delicious
French cheese,

48:03.631 --> 48:06.383
and I feel like I'm
still digesting it.

48:06.384 --> 48:10.345
My delicate American body
couldn't handle
the French cheese.

48:10.346 --> 48:12.431
And it's not like
I don't eat cheese.

48:12.432 --> 48:15.809
Most of you are looking at me
like, "We think you eat cheese.

48:15.810 --> 48:19.313
We think you might
only eat cheese."

48:19.314 --> 48:22.065
But the French, they eat
cheese on a whole other level.

48:22.066 --> 48:23.817
In France,
they make eating cheese

48:23.818 --> 48:25.652
an official course
of the meal.

48:25.653 --> 48:27.362
So you'll eat an appetizer,

48:27.363 --> 48:29.489
then you'll eat an entree,
then for no reason at all

48:29.490 --> 48:32.784
you eat a bunch of
chunks of cheese,

48:32.785 --> 48:34.036
then you eat dessert.

48:34.037 --> 48:37.080
After that,
you go to the hospital.

48:37.081 --> 48:40.000
And of course, I've eaten
chunks of cheese before,

48:40.001 --> 48:42.419
just not in public.

48:42.420 --> 48:45.213
Or with pants on.

48:45.214 --> 48:47.007
Eating chunks of cheese,

48:47.008 --> 48:49.301
that's something I'm
usually caught doing.

48:49.302 --> 48:50.927
My wife's like, "What
the hell are you doin'?"

48:50.928 --> 48:54.097
"Nothing honey!"

48:54.098 --> 48:56.892
I remember the first time
I had the cheese course,

48:56.893 --> 48:58.977
I'd eaten an appetizer,
I'd eaten my entree

48:58.978 --> 49:00.520
and I started eating
my cheese course,

49:00.521 --> 49:04.524
and I heard my heart
say, "Are you mad at me?

49:04.525 --> 49:07.110
Did I do something
to anger you?"

49:07.111 --> 49:08.820
My brain took over.
"It's all right,
it's all right.

49:08.821 --> 49:11.156
"There's gonna be
some sweating.

49:11.157 --> 49:13.617
"Bowels, you can take
a couple weeks off.

49:13.618 --> 49:15.285
Appendix, get ready to blow."

49:15.286 --> 49:16.745
(audience laughs)

49:16.746 --> 49:19.247
Tried so many delicious
French cheeses,

49:19.248 --> 49:21.541
and I couldn't tell you
the name of one of them.

49:21.542 --> 49:23.293
And they would
tell me the names.

49:23.294 --> 49:25.837
They're like, "This is
(imitating French).

49:25.838 --> 49:28.340
From the
(imitating French) region."

49:28.341 --> 49:31.510
And I'd be like,
"So not cheddar?

49:31.511 --> 49:32.928
"'Cause I tried cheddar.

49:32.929 --> 49:35.806
"You guys get cheddar
over here yet?

49:35.807 --> 49:38.600
I like me some cheddar."

49:38.601 --> 49:41.395
Some of the French cheeses
I tried were goat cheese,

49:41.396 --> 49:44.606
or as the goats
call it, cheese.

49:44.607 --> 49:48.485
They're not caught up
in your cow cheese bias.

49:48.486 --> 49:51.780
You know, when I see cheese
I don't even see an animal.

49:51.781 --> 49:54.741
I just see something
my body can't process.

49:54.742 --> 49:58.245
(audience laughs)

49:58.246 --> 50:00.956
I like goat cheese. I'd never
looked at a goat and thought,

50:00.957 --> 50:02.833
"I bet that would
make good cheese."

50:02.834 --> 50:04.710
(audience laughs)

50:04.711 --> 50:06.461
How do we even get to
the point of goat cheese?

50:06.462 --> 50:08.755
Was someone like,
"This cow cheese is good,

50:08.756 --> 50:11.758
but see that dog that
looks like it smokes meth?"

50:11.759 --> 50:16.681
(audience cheering,
applauding)

50:18.516 --> 50:20.892
"Can someone try and milk it?

50:20.893 --> 50:21.977
"I got a hunch it
would make cheese

50:21.978 --> 50:24.229
that would great with beets."

50:24.230 --> 50:26.565
(audience laughs)

50:26.566 --> 50:29.192
Those Europeans, they have
a different approach to dairy.

50:29.193 --> 50:30.736
When they make a
sandwich in Europe

50:30.737 --> 50:32.362
they put butter
on their bread,

50:32.363 --> 50:34.239
they put butter on the bread,
and then mayonnaise.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.032
Ugh.

50:36.033 --> 50:39.077
That's like putting on
contacts and glasses.

50:39.078 --> 50:41.288
(audience laughs)

50:41.289 --> 50:42.622
Butter on the bread
of a sandwich?

50:42.623 --> 50:44.291
That actually sounds
like something Americans

50:44.292 --> 50:47.544
would do that Europeans
would criticize us for.

50:47.545 --> 50:50.255
"Those American pigs,
when they make a sandwich,

50:50.256 --> 50:52.507
"they put butter on the bread.

50:52.508 --> 50:55.302
No wonder they fat pig."

50:55.303 --> 50:57.971
That's a good impression
of absolutely every European.

50:57.972 --> 51:02.058
(audience laughs)

51:02.059 --> 51:03.435
I did love doing
shows over there.

51:03.436 --> 51:05.479
You never knew what
was gonna work.

51:05.480 --> 51:06.980
Sometimes there's
a language barrier.

51:06.981 --> 51:08.774
There's different references.

51:08.775 --> 51:10.233
There's famous people
in other countries

51:10.234 --> 51:11.651
we've never heard of.

51:11.652 --> 51:13.653
I was doing this show
in Ireland before.

51:13.654 --> 51:15.280
I was doing the sound check
before the show,

51:15.281 --> 51:16.573
and the sound guy was like,

51:16.574 --> 51:18.909
"Do you have any
special requests?"

51:18.910 --> 51:20.994
And I jokingly said, "Well,
I'll probably close my show

51:20.995 --> 51:23.163
by singing Raglan Road,"

51:23.164 --> 51:24.498
which is a famous
Irish folk song

51:24.499 --> 51:26.583
based on a famous Irish poem

51:26.584 --> 51:30.378
and the sound guy was like,
"Ooh, I don't recommend that."

51:30.379 --> 51:32.839
And I was like,
"Well, I was kidding but why?"

51:32.840 --> 51:35.258
And he goes, "Well recently
Billy Joelle did that."

51:35.259 --> 51:37.511
And I was like,
"Who's Billy Joelle?"

51:37.512 --> 51:39.513
(audience laughs)

51:39.514 --> 51:42.933
And he goes, "You don't
know who Billy Joelle is?"

51:42.934 --> 51:45.519
I was like, "I'm from
another country,

51:45.520 --> 51:46.520
"I don't know
who's famous here.

51:46.521 --> 51:47.979
"What is it,
Superman's dad?

51:47.980 --> 51:50.023
I don't know."

51:50.024 --> 51:53.235
He goes, "Billy Joelle
is from America.

51:53.236 --> 51:55.320
And I was like,
"Oh my gosh, there's
an American who's famous

51:55.321 --> 51:59.032
in Ireland that
I've never heard of."

51:59.033 --> 52:03.537
He goes, "Billy Joelle,
Piano Man. Uptown Girl."

52:03.538 --> 52:05.580
I was like,
"Oh, you mean Billy Joel."

52:05.581 --> 52:07.499
(audience laughs)

52:07.500 --> 52:10.126
He goes,
"No, it's Billy Joelle."

52:10.127 --> 52:13.088
For a second I thought,
"Maybe he's right."

52:13.089 --> 52:15.341
(audience laughs)

52:17.009 --> 52:19.511
This wouldn't be the
first time I discovered

52:19.512 --> 52:23.598
I mispronounced someone's
name for my entire life.

52:23.599 --> 52:25.392
In my mind I started
going through

52:25.393 --> 52:27.143
every conversation
I had on Billy Joel.

52:27.144 --> 52:30.021
I'm like, "Did anybody
else say Billy Joelle?

52:30.022 --> 52:34.317
When I said Billy Joel,
did anyone look at me strange?"

52:34.318 --> 52:36.528
Then I remember, you know
who pronounces it Billy Joel?

52:36.529 --> 52:38.822
Billy Joel.

52:38.823 --> 52:41.199
And at that point
the opening act had come in,

52:41.200 --> 52:43.076
and he was also from Ireland,
and I said,

52:43.077 --> 52:45.161
"Hey, this sound guys
calls Billy Joel Billy Joelle.

52:45.162 --> 52:49.082
And the Irish comic
goes, "It is Billy Joelle."

52:49.083 --> 52:52.502
I was like, "Is everyone
crazy in this country?

52:52.503 --> 52:54.629
What, there's no one
in Ireland named Joel?"

52:54.630 --> 52:57.799
And he goes, "Yeah,
we call them Joelle."

52:57.800 --> 52:59.801
I was like, "Well then,
what would you call someone

52:59.802 --> 53:01.595
who's actually named Joelle?"

53:01.596 --> 53:05.599
He goes, "You mean
like Billy Joelle?"

53:05.600 --> 53:09.060
Stop it.

53:09.061 --> 53:10.395
No.

53:10.396 --> 53:12.022
I loved Ireland.

53:12.023 --> 53:13.356
I spent two weeks there.

53:13.357 --> 53:15.191
One of the weeks,
I was in Donegal,

53:15.192 --> 53:17.903
which is a county in
the northwestern part of
the Republic,

53:17.904 --> 53:19.654
and I had noticed something.

53:19.655 --> 53:21.907
Everyone in Donegal
has a washer and dryer,

53:21.908 --> 53:24.242
but nobody uses their dryer.

53:24.243 --> 53:26.536
They're like,
"That won't be necessary.

53:26.537 --> 53:29.247
We'll just
hang that out to dry."

53:29.248 --> 53:31.082
And I was kinda skeptical,
but I was staying with friends,

53:31.083 --> 53:32.709
and they offered
to do my laundry,

53:32.710 --> 53:34.169
so they took my clothes
and they washed it,

53:34.170 --> 53:35.962
and they hung it out to dry,

53:35.963 --> 53:38.757
and I was kind of impressed
'cause after only three days...

53:38.758 --> 53:41.384
(audience laughs)

53:41.385 --> 53:43.011
my clothes were still wet.

53:43.012 --> 53:45.305
(audience laughs)

53:45.306 --> 53:46.640
'Cause what they've
yet to realize

53:46.641 --> 53:49.517
is it rains every
day in Donegal.

53:49.518 --> 53:52.479
It's like living in a shower.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.898
But my friend, she was so
proud of the line drying,

53:54.899 --> 53:56.775
she goes,
"Isn't that just better?

53:56.776 --> 53:59.069
Doesn't that smell glorious?"

53:59.070 --> 54:02.781
Meanwhile I'm holding
a wet tee shirt.

54:02.782 --> 54:04.240
"Yeah, this is great.

54:04.241 --> 54:08.620
I can just pretend
I got off a log ride."

54:08.621 --> 54:11.414
"There's nothing better than
waking up on a cold morning

54:11.415 --> 54:14.125
and putting on a wet
Billy Joelle tee shirt."

54:14.126 --> 54:16.169
(audience laughs)

54:16.170 --> 54:20.424
(audience cheering,
applauding)

54:24.095 --> 54:25.720
My kids were with
me in Amsterdam.

54:25.721 --> 54:27.347
I brought my kids to
the Anne Frank house.

54:27.348 --> 54:29.307
I told some friends that
and they were like,

54:29.308 --> 54:31.518
"Aren't your kids
a little young for
the Anne Frank house?"

54:31.519 --> 54:35.188
And you know what I learned?
They are. They're too young.

54:35.189 --> 54:36.856
But I wanted to
bring them, you know?

54:36.857 --> 54:38.733
It's an important place
I want them to learn.

54:38.734 --> 54:40.819
So I brought them.
We were standing outside
the Anne Frank house,

54:40.820 --> 54:43.488
and I said, "This is a
special somber place.

54:43.489 --> 54:46.157
"This is where Anne Frank,
her family and some friends

54:46.158 --> 54:47.993
"hid from the Nazis
for two years,

54:47.994 --> 54:49.536
"and they couldn't
speak during the day,

54:49.537 --> 54:51.329
"and Anne also
wrote this diary.

54:51.330 --> 54:52.455
So let's be respectful."

54:52.456 --> 54:53.957
My six year old
raises his hand

54:53.958 --> 54:56.376
and he goes, "Do they
have video games here?"

54:56.377 --> 54:57.877
(audience laughs)

54:57.878 --> 55:01.423
And I said, "I'm gonna
need you to be quiet,

55:01.424 --> 55:03.383
for the rest of your life."

55:03.384 --> 55:05.176
(audience laughs)

55:05.177 --> 55:07.178
I bought tickets online
to the Anne Frank house.

55:07.179 --> 55:08.972
I Googled it.

55:08.973 --> 55:11.016
The Anne Frank house
has a Google rating

55:11.017 --> 55:14.853
of 4.4 out of five stars.

55:14.854 --> 55:19.482
Who's giving the Anne
Frank house a bad review?

55:19.483 --> 55:21.776
(audience laughs)

55:21.777 --> 55:24.529
It's like, "Yeah,
it wasn't that fun.

55:24.530 --> 55:27.449
It was kind of crowded,
and there were no video games."

55:27.450 --> 55:29.409
(audience laughs)

55:29.410 --> 55:32.704
Why do we feel the need
to review everything?

55:32.705 --> 55:36.541
Nobody's going to Anne Frank's
house looking for hot dogs.

55:36.542 --> 55:41.129
"Well, I misread it. I thought
it was Anne's Frank house.

55:41.130 --> 55:44.424
I was gettin' ready to
have me an Amsterdam dog."

55:44.425 --> 55:46.176
(audience laughs)

55:46.177 --> 55:47.719
When I travel with my kids,

55:47.720 --> 55:50.305
we always try to do one
educational thing a day.

55:50.306 --> 55:53.475
It usually involves going to
a museum, and museums are great,

55:53.476 --> 55:55.810
they're important, but
they're also exhausting, right?

55:55.811 --> 55:58.104
Acting like you're
interested in that crap.

55:58.105 --> 56:00.398
(audience laughs)

56:00.399 --> 56:03.735
There's so much pressure
to be impressed in a museum.

56:03.736 --> 56:05.653
It's like "Ooh,
look at that kids.

56:05.654 --> 56:08.114
"Wow, that's a, well
that's a water fountain.

56:08.115 --> 56:10.784
What do we got over here?"

56:10.785 --> 56:12.869
And I've been to all
kinds of museums.

56:12.870 --> 56:14.871
I've been to
children's museums,

56:14.872 --> 56:17.415
which are really just
museums of diseases

56:17.416 --> 56:20.543
your kids can get from
other peoples kids.

56:20.544 --> 56:22.087
It's like, "Why don't
you go over there

56:22.088 --> 56:25.215
and see if we get
the chicken pox."

56:25.216 --> 56:28.468
In Stockholm, I brought
my kids to a ship museum,

56:28.469 --> 56:32.597
the Vasa Museum.
It was a ship museum,
but it only had one ship,

56:32.598 --> 56:35.683
so it felt more
like a ship garage.

56:35.684 --> 56:37.936
But that one ship,
the Vasa ship,

56:37.937 --> 56:42.190
sunk on its maiden voyage
in Stockholm's harbor
in the 1700's,

56:42.191 --> 56:45.360
which is not good,
but that's the largest
attraction in Sweden.

56:45.361 --> 56:47.278
Most countries,
their big attraction

56:47.279 --> 56:49.948
is a design marvel like
the Sydney Opera House

56:49.949 --> 56:52.200
or the Eiffel Tower,
but Sweden was like,

56:52.201 --> 56:54.452
"Here's our boat
that didn't float."

56:54.453 --> 56:57.288
(audience laughs)

56:57.289 --> 56:59.290
"This is why
we make furniture."

56:59.291 --> 57:02.794
(audience laughs)

57:02.795 --> 57:04.963
"That, ironically, floats."

57:04.964 --> 57:07.632
(audience laughs)

57:07.633 --> 57:09.884
Often the museums
are art museums.

57:09.885 --> 57:12.053
Those are the most
intimidating, right?

57:12.054 --> 57:15.181
'Cause in art museums, they
tell us what is the good art.

57:15.182 --> 57:17.600
We have no say in the matter.
"That's good art."

57:17.601 --> 57:22.438
"Oh, okay.
I'll take your word for it."

57:22.439 --> 57:24.357
They treat everyone like
a child in an art museum.

57:24.358 --> 57:25.441
They're like,
"Don't touch anything.

57:25.442 --> 57:26.818
Nobody touch anything."

57:26.819 --> 57:29.612
I wasn't gonna.

57:29.613 --> 57:30.780
Now I kinda want to.

57:30.781 --> 57:32.740
(audience laughs)

57:32.741 --> 57:34.033
Everyone's speaking
in hushed tones.

57:34.034 --> 57:35.410
"Be respectful.

57:35.411 --> 57:38.663
"We're about to look at
the work of a mad man.

57:38.664 --> 57:42.083
He painted this after he
chopped off his own ear."

57:42.084 --> 57:45.503
"Why are we whispering?
Van Gogh's dead.

57:45.504 --> 57:48.006
Even if he was alive,
he couldn't hear us."

57:48.007 --> 57:50.383
(audience laughs)

57:50.384 --> 57:52.135
Recently after a show,
someone came up to me.

57:52.136 --> 57:54.095
They're like you know,
it's not pronounced Van Gogh,

57:54.096 --> 57:56.139
it's pronounced
Billy Joelle.

57:56.140 --> 57:58.349
(audience laughs)

57:58.350 --> 58:02.646
(audience cheering,
applauding)

58:05.107 --> 58:07.734
I do find it hard
to leave art museums,

58:07.735 --> 58:10.278
mainly 'cause I
can't find the exit.

58:10.279 --> 58:12.030
Great, another room filled

58:12.031 --> 58:14.908
with paintings of
ugly Dutch people.

58:14.909 --> 58:19.621
In the 1600's they painted
every ugly Dutch person.

58:19.622 --> 58:21.873
"Hey, you're hard to look at.
Can I do your portrait?"

58:21.874 --> 58:25.251
(audience laughs)

58:25.252 --> 58:26.961
"Makin' that hay
look good aren't ya?"

58:26.962 --> 58:28.880
(audience laughs)

58:28.881 --> 58:32.258
Fine art, sometimes I feel
like it's wasted on me.

58:32.259 --> 58:33.384
You know like the Mona Lisa?

58:33.385 --> 58:35.053
We've all seen the Mona Lisa.

58:35.054 --> 58:37.805
The most beautiful
smile in the world.

58:37.806 --> 58:39.390
The most beautiful smile.

58:39.391 --> 58:41.309
I'm like, "Have you
seen Halle Berry?"

58:41.310 --> 58:42.894
(audience laughs)

58:42.895 --> 58:44.395
Heck, have you
seen Chuck Berry?

58:44.396 --> 58:45.688
(audience laughs)

58:45.689 --> 58:48.399
I don't even know
if Mona Lisa's smiling.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.735
To me it looks like she's,
just came from the dentist.

58:50.736 --> 58:51.736
She's like, "Mmm."

58:51.737 --> 58:53.905
(audience laughs)

58:53.906 --> 58:57.033
"Novocain's wearin' off."

58:57.034 --> 58:59.619
Art museums will
occasionally ask

58:59.620 --> 59:01.246
if you'd like to
become a member.

59:01.247 --> 59:02.872
"Would you like to
become a member?"

59:02.873 --> 59:07.293
"Uh, how, how often would
I have to come here?"

59:07.294 --> 59:10.004
(audience laughs)

59:10.005 --> 59:15.593
I think I can only pretend
to be interested once.

59:15.594 --> 59:18.054
There's always people
sketching in an art museum.

59:18.055 --> 59:19.347
I always point them
out to security.

59:19.348 --> 59:21.641
I'm like, "Copying."

59:21.642 --> 59:26.479
Got a forgery
happening mid forge.

59:26.480 --> 59:30.358
Those art museum security guards
you know, they're important.

59:30.359 --> 59:33.278
Some of that art is priceless.
Some of it's on loan.

59:33.279 --> 59:34.279
You see that next to a painting.

59:34.280 --> 59:37.532
On loan from a rich person.

59:37.533 --> 59:41.536
"The poor people
may look at my art.

59:41.537 --> 59:44.747
But don't let them get their
peasant fingers on it."

59:44.748 --> 59:47.542
(audience laughs)

59:47.543 --> 59:49.377
Some of that art is priceless.

59:49.378 --> 59:54.173
Recently, a Da Vinci painting
sold for $450 million.

59:54.174 --> 59:58.261
400-- What room do you
put that in your house?

59:58.262 --> 01:00:00.888
"I put that in the game room."

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:03.016
It was a Da Vinci
painting, Salvator Mundi.

01:00:03.017 --> 01:00:04.976
It was a painting of Jesus,

01:00:04.977 --> 01:00:07.979
but it's not like Da Vinci even
knew what Jesus looked like.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:11.024
He painted it 1500 years
after Jesus walked the earth.

01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:12.817
So he was just guessing.
He's like, "I don't know.

01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:14.736
He's got brown eyes probably?
I don't know."

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:16.029
(audience laughs)

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:20.158
He probably just
painted someone he knew.

01:00:20.159 --> 01:00:21.868
You know back in
the day they're like,

01:00:21.869 --> 01:00:24.078
people are like, "What,
is that your nephew Eddie?"

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:26.748
Da Vinci's like,
"No, that's Jesus.

01:00:26.749 --> 01:00:28.416
(audience laughs)

01:00:28.417 --> 01:00:30.918
The savior of the world."

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:32.545
(audience laughs)

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:36.966
"Eddie is wearing
the same outfit as him."

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.509
"That's a coincidence."

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.263
(audience laughs)

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:44.807
So many paintings
of Jesus right?

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:48.186
But there's really two
types of paintings of Jesus.

01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:51.898
There's Jesus as an adult,
or Jesus as a baby.

01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:54.817
There's no teenage Jesus.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:58.988
There's no acne Jesus,

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.115
with the beginning
of a mustache.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:02.950
(audience laughs)

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:06.329
"Jim, you're going
to Hell for that."

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:10.166
And you sound
so dumb right now.

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:12.710
That is my worst fear is to
come across like an idiot,

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:14.504
and you guys are like,
"You should be terrified then."

01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:16.422
(audience laughs)

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:18.716
I mostly get nervous
when I'm talking to
really smart people.

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:20.301
You ever been
talking to someone,

01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:24.180
and you hear yourself
not make sense?

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:27.850
But instead of stopping,
you just keep talkin'?

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:32.021
"You know what? I'll pull it
together at the end.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:35.650
Oops, that might
not have been a word."

01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:38.403
That's usually the moment
where I make eye contact
with my wife.

01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:40.780
She's like, "What the hell
are you doing?"

01:01:40.781 --> 01:01:44.242
"I'm trying to
make you look good."

01:01:44.243 --> 01:01:46.285
Here's how dumb I am.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:48.413
When someone's criticized
on social media

01:01:48.414 --> 01:01:51.416
for being stupid,
I get nervous.

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:55.086
Like, "Oh, they're comin'
for all us dummies.

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:59.298
Probably gonna start with a
spellin' test or somethin'."

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:01.676
(Jim chuckles)

01:02:01.677 --> 01:02:04.429
The kids aren't with me,
but if we're really quiet

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.264
we can hear them screaming
in New York City.

01:02:06.265 --> 01:02:07.932
(audience laughs)

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:09.767
When I travel
without my children,

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.310
in between those
moments of guilt,

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:13.688
are just hours of happiness.

01:02:13.689 --> 01:02:15.523
(audience laughs)

01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:18.652
(audience cheering,
applauding)

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:22.780
I mean, I love my kids.

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:24.907
I just love them more
when I'm not with them.

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:26.993
(audience laughs)

01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:29.370
And when I travel without
my kids, I do nothing.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.122
I'm so productive when
I travel with them.

01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:33.166
When they're not here,
I do nothing,

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:35.084
and then I'll do nothing
all day and then

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.003
I'll call home
and my saintly wife

01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:38.796
will just pick up the phone,

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:41.132
and there'll be chaos
in the background.

01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:42.508
And she'll be like,
"What'd you do today?"

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.552
And I'll be like,
"What'd I do?

01:02:44.553 --> 01:02:47.805
"Well, I got up.

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:50.141
Did that a couple times."

01:02:50.142 --> 01:02:51.809
(audience laughs)

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:55.396
"Enough about me.
What about you?"

01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:57.064
And she'll put my
kids on the phone.

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:58.357
They'll be like,
"Third grade's hard,"

01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:01.652
and I'll be like,
"It gets so much worse."

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:03.279
School is hard you know?

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.072
I try and be supportive
in the morning.

01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:07.283
I'll be like, "Look,
I know you don't wanna go,

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:11.871
"but just remember, I never
have to go to school again.

01:03:11.872 --> 01:03:14.081
Anyway, off you go.
I'm gonna nap."

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:15.584
(audience laughs)

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:19.754
I don't know.
I wouldn't wanna be a kid.

01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:20.963
I like the age I am.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.215
I wouldn't
wanna be a teenager.

01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:23.508
I wouldn't wanna be
in my 20's.

01:03:23.509 --> 01:03:25.510
I like being 30 years old.

01:03:25.511 --> 01:03:29.639
(audience laughs)

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.767
I try and schedule tours
around school breaks, you know?

01:03:32.768 --> 01:03:35.770
Like at Christmas one year,
I did a bunch of shows
in Florida,

01:03:35.771 --> 01:03:37.355
and my wife
and kids came down.

01:03:37.356 --> 01:03:38.856
My wife's family
also came down

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:41.067
'cause they didn't want
us to have a good time.

01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:43.861
(audience laughs)

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:46.489
I'm kidding.
I love my wife's family.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:49.867
Did that sound believable?

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:50.993
I do love them.

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:52.453
They're my in-laws.

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:54.413
That's a strange term,
in-laws.

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:58.209
"Are you related?"
"Uh, legally.

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:01.462
In a court of law."

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:03.589
In-law, it's like the
opposite of being in love.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.758
We're in law.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:08.553
We law each other.

01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:10.888
Very much.

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:12.890
In-laws are like
family you're assigned.

01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:14.392
It's like, "You wanna spend
your life with that person?

01:04:14.393 --> 01:04:17.353
You gotta take
those 10 people."

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:20.147
"All of them?"

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:24.360
My only issue with my in-laws
is there's too many of them.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:25.945
My wife is
one of nine children,

01:04:25.946 --> 01:04:28.823
so every holiday all
nine of the siblings

01:04:28.824 --> 01:04:31.033
and their individual
families all

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:34.870
get together and spend
every moment together.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:39.542
Over Christmas, I went to
a movie with 30 people.

01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:42.336
I didn't even know
that was legal.

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:43.754
We were walkin' around,

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:47.383
people thought we
were from a church.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:51.304
To put it in perspective Jesus
only walked around with 12.

01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:53.598
(audience laughs)

01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:56.058
I learned very
quickly I don't wanna

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:59.061
do anything with 30 people.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.147
If I was on the Titanic
and the last rescue boat

01:05:01.148 --> 01:05:04.525
was filled with 30 people,
I'd be like, "You guys go ahead.

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:06.360
"I don't want to be
there when you try

01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:07.778
and decide
where to eat lunch."

01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:10.197
(audience laughs)

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:12.533
Oh, but it was more
then 30 people,

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:15.745
'cause sometimes those
30 people will invite
other people.

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:17.622
So you'll have
conversations and someone

01:05:17.623 --> 01:05:20.374
will be like, "I'm your
wife's uncles best friend."

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:23.210
Oh, there's a term for that.
Stranger.

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:25.588
(audience laughs)

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:27.048
You're a total stranger.

01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:30.551
(audience cheering,
applauding)

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:32.303
I do love my wife's parents.

01:05:32.304 --> 01:05:33.929
Their names are
Louise and Dominic

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.640
so I call them Louise and Dom.

01:05:35.641 --> 01:05:37.725
My wife's siblings, some
of them have gotten married

01:05:37.726 --> 01:05:39.894
and their spouses,
some of their spouses

01:05:39.895 --> 01:05:45.358
call Louise and Dom
Mom and Dad 'cause
they're weirdos.

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:46.692
No, I understand.

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:47.985
Sometimes you
marry into a family

01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:49.695
and become so close
to the parents

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:52.573
that you wanna call them
Mom and Dad, but don't.

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:54.867
(audience laughs)

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:59.080
It's weird and confusing
for the rest of us.

01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:01.832
Wait, that's his mom?

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:03.084
He married his sister?

01:06:03.085 --> 01:06:05.628
(audience laughs)

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:07.797
What state is he from?

01:06:07.798 --> 01:06:09.800
(audience laughs)

01:06:12.094 --> 01:06:14.220
This is, by the way
this is all prosthetic.

01:06:14.221 --> 01:06:16.138
(audience laughs)

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:17.473
After the show it comes off.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.600
I just air it out
and it's like,

01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:23.521
I feel so free when I get
it off, you know what I mean?

01:06:23.522 --> 01:06:26.524
It's getting harder and harder
to motivate to exercise.

01:06:26.525 --> 01:06:29.610
In your 20's, you're like,
"I wanna be with someone
physically fit,

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:31.112
so I'll be physically fit,"
and in your 30's,

01:06:31.113 --> 01:06:33.406
you're like,
"I wanna fight off aging,"

01:06:33.407 --> 01:06:35.366
and in your 40's
you're like, "It's over."

01:06:35.367 --> 01:06:37.868
(audience laughs)

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.745
And now I'm at the
point where I look

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:43.874
at morbidly obese people and
I'm like, "They seem happy."

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:47.712
That's one way to live a life.

01:06:47.713 --> 01:06:50.339
I used to exercise
to lose weight.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:55.136
Now I exercise so I can
continue to fit in cars.

01:06:55.137 --> 01:06:57.471
It's still a fitness goal.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:00.433
(audience laughs)

01:07:00.434 --> 01:07:03.394
I've been in better
shape in my life.

01:07:03.395 --> 01:07:05.146
I go in and out.
It's been awhile.

01:07:05.147 --> 01:07:06.814
Not last year but
the year before

01:07:06.815 --> 01:07:08.607
my big accomplishment is

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:10.484
I ran the
New York City Marathon.

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.528
- (audience applauds)
- Thank you.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.739
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:18.075
Half of you are,
like, "No, you didn't."

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:20.494
I did, you bastards,
all right?

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:23.748
I ran and completed.
All right, fine, I didn't.

01:07:23.749 --> 01:07:25.833
(audience laughs)

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:28.419
But I thought about it.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:31.672
Which I guess is technically
different then running it.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:33.549
It turns out I couldn't run

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:37.678
the New York City Marathon
'cause I didn't want to.

01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:40.347
Which is the main reason
I don't do a lotta things.

01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:42.433
I just rarely admit it.

01:07:42.434 --> 01:07:44.518
It's like, "Hey, Jim,
why didn't you come
to my birthday party?"

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:47.438
"I didn't want to."

01:07:47.439 --> 01:07:49.940
We never really reply
to invitations that way.

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:53.861
"Don't wanna go.

01:07:53.862 --> 01:07:56.697
Completely available,
just not interested."

01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:59.575
(audience laughs)

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:02.203
"Really wish I wasn't there,
so I won't be."

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:04.413
(audience laughs)

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.874
I know people who have run
the New York City Marathon.

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:08.584
They always bring it up.

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:10.211
They're like, "Yeah, I ran
the New York City Marathon."

01:08:10.212 --> 01:08:12.922
I always ask, "Did you win?"

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:14.590
"No, but I finished."

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:16.926
"What place you come at?"
"I don't know."

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:20.304
"Sounds like
you came in last."

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:24.975
"Really what you're saying
is you lost the New York
City Marathon."

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.435
"If I were you I
wouldn't bring that up."

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.020
(audience laughs)

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:30.356
But that's why some
people run marathons

01:08:30.357 --> 01:08:32.817
so that they can say,
"I ran a marathon."

01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:36.278
Which to me is not
a good enough reason.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.988
Heck, I can say
I ran a marathon.

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:40.866
In fact, earlier I did.

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:43.077
It didn't feel good,
it felt dishonest.

01:08:43.078 --> 01:08:47.832
I guess what I'm trying to say
is marathon runners are liars.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:50.167
All of them.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:52.044
It's too far.
It's way too far.

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:56.549
26.2 miles, that's too far
to run, jog or frankly drive.

01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:58.716
Let's be serious.

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.594
But you know what?
I'm not a runner.

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:01.761
I'm not a runner.
Half of you are like,

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:04.014
"We never thought you were.

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:06.433
At this point we're not
sure if you're a walker."

01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:08.519
But running is huge right?

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.270
There are stores
just for runners.

01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:12.022
There's magazines
dedicated to running.

01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:14.441
"Runners World," a magazine
all about running,

01:09:14.442 --> 01:09:16.484
and if you thought
running was boring,

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.863
wait 'til you read
about running.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:21.698
(audience laughs)

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.535
At this point,
is there any information

01:09:24.536 --> 01:09:27.872
we don't have on running?

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:32.001
Oh, you're supposed to use
your arms when you run.

01:09:32.002 --> 01:09:36.046
What? I think I've been
runnin' backwards.

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:38.340
No wonder I keep losin'.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.926
(audience laughs)

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:41.969
The runners high.

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:44.220
I'm sure that's not a myth.

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:50.394
Let me get this right.
You're confusing
exhaustion for high?

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:53.147
Have you ever
been high before?

01:09:53.148 --> 01:09:58.027
How can you confuse,
"I can't breathe" with "Joy?"

01:09:58.028 --> 01:10:00.362
(audience laughs)

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.781
The runner's high.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:04.700
Has anyone ever used
that as an excuse?

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:08.704
Sorry I ate all the chips.
Runner's high.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:10.205
Hey, I ran a 10K
in high school.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.875
I think I'm still high.

01:10:12.876 --> 01:10:15.502
But there's running, and then
there's running a marathon.

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:19.340
You know you have to
pay to run a marathon?

01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:21.467
What?

01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:23.093
For the New York City Marathon

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:25.262
you have to pay $250

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:31.268
to run by yourself 26 miles.

01:10:31.269 --> 01:10:35.522
That's some
S&M stuff there.

01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:36.982
That's like the subplot of

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:39.068
a "Law & Order:
Special Victims Unit."

01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:41.362
You gotta pay that up front.

01:10:41.363 --> 01:10:43.030
It's not like there's
a toll system.

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:44.406
Like we're on 13 mile.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:47.910
What is this a chip reader?

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:49.745
You ever see the
beginning of a marathon?

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:52.331
All there runners line up in
their voluntary prison number?

01:10:52.332 --> 01:10:54.249
(audience laughs)

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:57.586
And then someone
shoots a gun. Red flag.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:01.215
And the runners disperse
like Godzilla's approaching.

01:11:01.216 --> 01:11:03.175
Ah!

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:07.137
Why is there a weapon
involved in a foot race?

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:11.058
Whatever happened to
someone saying "go?"

01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:13.560
All right let's review how
we're gonna start the marathon.

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:15.562
We'll get all the
lemmings lined up there

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:18.774
and then without any warning,
Cooter will shoot his .357.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:21.235
(audience laughs)

01:11:21.236 --> 01:11:24.321
In the air this time, Cooter.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:26.615
Then we'll just sit
back, count the money

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:29.243
and watch some of
them soil themselves.

01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:30.786
(audience laughs)

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:34.207
(audience cheering,
applauding)

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:41.255
You ever see the
winner of a marathon?

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:43.590
They do not look healthy.

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:47.219
They look like they were
forced to run a marathon.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:50.139
Like it was some negotiation
as part of ransom.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.515
I finished, I finished!

01:11:51.516 --> 01:11:54.476
Now can I have my children?

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:57.062
I ran 26 miles,
I drank my own urine,

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:59.106
I'm wearing
a tin foil blanket.

01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:02.359
What's going on
with my kids?

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.778
Of course I respect
people who run marathons.

01:12:04.779 --> 01:12:06.071
Heck, I'm impressed
by the people

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:08.741
who pass out
water at marathons.

01:12:08.742 --> 01:12:11.869
I always look at them,
I'm like, I couldn't do that.

01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:16.749
Probably gotta get up early,
then you gotta find cups.

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:20.252
Then there's passin'
out all that water.

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:23.881
My arm's just sore
thinkin' about it.

01:12:23.882 --> 01:12:26.216
At least those people are doing
something at the marathon.

01:12:26.217 --> 01:12:28.260
You ever see the rest of the
people watchin' the marathon?

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:30.387
They're like.

01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:32.057
(audience laughs)

01:12:36.144 --> 01:12:40.105
What is going on
in your life,

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:44.818
if you're watching
strangers run a marathon?

01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:46.654
(audience laughs)

01:12:49.491 --> 01:12:51.784
I suppose some of them are
there supporting friends.

01:12:51.785 --> 01:12:53.368
I wouldn't want that.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:58.123
I don't even want someone
to see me in a hurry.

01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:01.168
That seems like a big
request of a friend, right?

01:13:01.169 --> 01:13:05.089
"Hey, can you watch
me run 26 miles?

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:08.300
Only take your entire Sunday."

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:11.136
You can only watch someone
run part of a marathon.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:12.638
It's not that big
of a commitment.

01:13:12.639 --> 01:13:14.306
It's like, "You can do it,
you can do it!

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:15.641
All right,
I'm goin' to brunch."

01:13:15.642 --> 01:13:18.685
(audience laughs)

01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:21.105
But you could watch
someone run a marathon.

01:13:21.106 --> 01:13:22.481
You can't go into
a health club

01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:25.442
and watch someone
on a treadmill.

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:26.986
(audience laughs)

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.411
"Excuse me sir,
what are you doin'?"

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.539
"I'm supportin' that lady."

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:41.458
(audience laughs)

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:44.920
"Do you, uh,
do you know her?"

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.922
"Not yet,

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:51.718
but I brought her this
lock for the bridge."

01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:54.096
All right, that is all for me.
Thank you very much.

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:55.472
(audience cheering,
applauding)

01:13:55.473 --> 01:13:57.307
This was so fun.
Thank you for coming.

01:13:57.308 --> 01:13:59.519
Appreciate it.

01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:07.193
(audience applauding,
cheering)
