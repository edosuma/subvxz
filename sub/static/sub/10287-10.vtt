00:02.035 --> 00:05.095
BOY. it is really coming down out there.

00:05.272 --> 00:07.502
Shut the window. sir.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.644
-Look. Mac.
-Oh. yes. sir. real nice.

00:10.810 --> 00:14.300
I'll put it in the fridge so you'll have
something to play with next summer.

00:14.613 --> 00:17.343
-It's beautiful. isn't it?
-Oh. sure.

00:17.516 --> 00:20.006
Heart attacks. Traffic deaths are up.

00:20.186 --> 00:23.346
Nothing like dying
in a winter wonderland. is there?

00:23.522 --> 00:26.252
Boy. I think it's enchanting.

00:26.425 --> 00:30.115
You know. snowdrifts up to here.
Jack Frost nipping at your nose.

00:30.295 --> 00:33.885
That lush. he hangs out in the lobby.
Yeah. he tried that with me too.

00:35.500 --> 00:39.700
-Well. I'm done with the heater.
-Are you crazy? It is still freezing in here.

00:39.871 --> 00:45.001
I didn't say I fixed it. I just said I'm done.
That baby wrestled me to the mat and won.

00:45.610 --> 00:48.140
-What are you gonna do next?
-Give the plumbing a shot.

00:48.313 --> 00:52.753
We got icicles hanging out of the faucets.
and most of the toilet water's frozen over.

00:53.384 --> 00:55.884
-You mean we can't--?
-Oh. you can give it a try.

00:56.054 --> 00:59.924
I mean. I like to think that's why
the good Lord gave us body heat.

01:01.893 --> 01:03.763
-Bail reports.
HARRY: Thanks. Selma.

01:03.928 --> 01:05.257
Here.

01:05.430 --> 01:07.330
-We got a few minutes?
-Sure.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.770
I'll be in the ladies' room.

01:56.481 --> 01:59.451
Court finds the defendant guilty.
and a $25 fine.

02:00.317 --> 02:02.217
Oh. no.

02:02.386 --> 02:04.876
I believe it was frozen. sir.

02:05.055 --> 02:07.145
It is a little chilly in here. isn't it?

02:07.324 --> 02:08.624
The Arctic is chilly. sir.

02:08.791 --> 02:11.921
We're talking glaciers in the commodes.
remember?

02:13.696 --> 02:17.356
Oh. no. No. it's so brisk and refreshing.

02:17.533 --> 02:21.333
While Nanook certainly is entitled
to her opinion...

02:21.704 --> 02:25.904
...we of the warm-blooded variety
feel as though an adjournment is in order.

02:26.075 --> 02:27.975
You mean shut down?

02:29.645 --> 02:31.665
Nah.

02:31.846 --> 02:35.476
You've got about six layers of clothes
hidden underneath that robe. don't you?

02:35.650 --> 02:37.850
It's good to be the king.

02:38.019 --> 02:42.479
-Next case. Mac.
-Call Warren Wilson and Frank Hayes.

02:43.425 --> 02:46.485
Okay. right over here.

02:49.598 --> 02:52.228
No messing on the floor.

02:53.501 --> 02:55.401
That's the law.

02:55.704 --> 02:58.674
Let me guess. Somebody got bit.

02:58.839 --> 03:01.039
Somebody got violated.

03:04.678 --> 03:07.478
Mac. don't let me guess anymore.

03:07.648 --> 03:10.448
It's ridiculous. No one was violated.
It's simple assault.

03:10.618 --> 03:13.988
Mr. Wilson here accosted Mr. Hayes.
and. according to eyewitnesses...

03:14.154 --> 03:18.154
...beat him about the head and neck
with a rubber dog bone.

03:18.324 --> 03:19.624
-Motive?
-Your Honor...

03:19.791 --> 03:23.091
...last week Mr. Hayes' dog
apparently had his way with Simone...

03:23.261 --> 03:24.791
...and an argument ensued.

03:24.962 --> 03:28.422
-Simone is the poodle. right?
-A prizewinning poodle. Your Honor.

03:28.599 --> 03:31.969
I'm paid expensive fees
to mate her with other prizewinners.

03:32.136 --> 03:35.126
He admits it. He's a dog pimp.

03:35.539 --> 03:37.869
There's gotta be laws
against sick stuff like that.

03:38.042 --> 03:40.102
-Mr. Hayes.
-I've seen his setup. Your Honor.

03:40.277 --> 03:41.467
He's got dozens of them.

03:41.646 --> 03:45.946
He must be running the largest kennel
of prostitution in the city.

03:46.117 --> 03:48.047
-Grow up. mutt face.
-Listen. you twerp.

03:48.219 --> 03:49.689
All right. that's enough.

03:49.854 --> 03:53.454
Your Honor. we have affidavits proving
that Mr. Hayes' animal was unleashed...

03:53.624 --> 03:55.284
...at the time of the coupling.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.428
Since Mr. Wilson's property
was damaged...

03:57.594 --> 04:00.964
...| suggest that the charge
be reduced to aggravated assault.

04:01.131 --> 04:03.001
Was your dog unleashed at the time?

04:03.166 --> 04:06.326
He was leashed. Your Honor.
but he chewed through it to get at her.

04:06.503 --> 04:10.003
Which ain't his fault.
because she led him on.

04:11.140 --> 04:12.630
That's a dog. Mr. Hayes.

04:12.808 --> 04:14.868
I know that. but she keeps coming by...

04:15.044 --> 04:19.314
...tempting him with those fancy ribbons
in her hair. that exotic perfume...

04:19.481 --> 04:22.541
...and that coquettish little trot of hers.

04:22.718 --> 04:27.488
-That is a disproven clichÃ©. Your Honor.
-That's a dog. Miss Young.

04:27.656 --> 04:30.086
That's right. Garth couldn't help himself.

04:30.259 --> 04:31.279
Garth?

04:32.127 --> 04:36.117
Hey. fine name for a dog. yes. sir.
Lot of character.

04:36.297 --> 04:38.627
The people are not willing
to reduce the charges...

04:38.800 --> 04:40.500
...because there was no damage done.

04:40.668 --> 04:43.728
I have a statement here
from a qualified veterinarian verifying...

04:43.905 --> 04:46.965
...that the defendant's dog
was not impregnated...

04:47.141 --> 04:51.101
...vis-a-vis the Garth tryst.

04:52.780 --> 04:55.410
Too close to call. huh?

04:55.983 --> 05:00.923
Men are men are men.
I'm rooting for the poodle.

05:03.191 --> 05:06.351
This document does not support
your claim of damage and injury.

05:06.794 --> 05:09.234
-I was damaged financially. Your Honor.
-How so?

05:10.331 --> 05:14.531
Simone won't consort
with other poodles anymore.

05:16.304 --> 05:20.474
-You mean. she's...?
-Got a thing for that tramp. right.

05:22.243 --> 05:24.773
Yeah. congratulations.

05:25.446 --> 05:28.246
I'm sorry. but that is not a defense
in an assault case.

05:28.416 --> 05:33.076
Court finds the defendant guilty as charged.
30 days suspended sentence. $500 fine.

05:33.254 --> 05:35.594
In accordance with law.
the dogs will be checked...

05:35.757 --> 05:39.627
...by the animal-regulation center
before they're returned to their owners.

05:40.361 --> 05:41.621
Uh....

05:41.796 --> 05:44.886
Hey. Art. Can I borrow your hammer
till the end of the session?

05:45.066 --> 05:48.296
-Hey. no prob.
-Case dismissed.

05:50.304 --> 05:52.504
Maybe I should have asked
for the rubber mallet.

05:52.673 --> 05:54.663
I could see it coming.

05:55.910 --> 05:59.440
-Bull. Selma. will you get the dogs?
-Let's go. big fella.

06:00.148 --> 06:02.408
Do you think it's okay
if I give him a bone?

06:02.583 --> 06:04.813
Well. if you're sure you're done with it.

06:09.190 --> 06:13.060
-Come on. sweetheart.
-She's gonna cry a lot if I'm not with her.

06:13.227 --> 06:18.127
I'll tell her the story of my life
so she won't feel so bad.

06:20.134 --> 06:23.074
Mr. Wilson. I'm sorry
I couldn't do more for you.

06:23.237 --> 06:26.497
Thanks. I appreciate your efforts.
Where do I pay this fine anyway?

06:26.674 --> 06:29.644
-Clerk's office. first floor.
-Thanks.

06:32.779 --> 06:33.909
Oh. Fielding.

06:34.614 --> 06:38.114
I want you to know there's no hard feelings.
I know you were doing your job.

06:38.285 --> 06:39.875
Got it.

06:40.052 --> 06:41.352
May I say something else?

06:42.520 --> 06:43.950
Shoot.

06:44.689 --> 06:46.449
I find you very attractive.

06:56.034 --> 06:57.594
What?

06:58.236 --> 07:01.256
I just feel attracted to you.
I thought you should know.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.333
You mean. you're...?

07:06.509 --> 07:08.169
Aren't you?

07:15.717 --> 07:17.877
Well. what do you think?

07:18.085 --> 07:20.845
I'm sorry. If I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to offend you.

07:21.021 --> 07:26.021
It's just that when you glanced at me.
I thought we had this eye thing going.

07:27.027 --> 07:29.497
-That's a twitch.
-Just forget it.

07:29.663 --> 07:33.533
-I get a tremor if we have a heavy night.
-Forget it. I made a mistake. all right?

07:33.701 --> 07:37.761
Yeah. well. you bet you did. I never even
slapped anybody with a towel in gym class.

07:39.339 --> 07:42.239
-Next case. Your Honor.
-What a night.

07:42.408 --> 07:43.498
What's the matter. Art?

07:44.077 --> 07:46.477
Well. I got some good news.
and I got some bad news.

07:46.646 --> 07:47.736
What's the bad news?

07:47.914 --> 07:49.644
I just spoke to the building manager.

07:49.815 --> 07:52.805
The blizzard has almost stopped
all the traffic in Manhattan.

07:52.985 --> 07:55.545
Snowdrifts have blocked
most of the structures.

07:55.721 --> 07:59.551
The police are requesting everybody stays
in their building until further notice.

07:59.724 --> 08:01.924
We could be locked in here
for a couple of days.

08:02.827 --> 08:04.817
What's the good news?

08:04.996 --> 08:06.586
There isn't any.

08:08.632 --> 08:10.122
I lied.

08:10.901 --> 08:15.531
We forgive you. Art.
Strategy time. Ten-minute recess.

08:16.907 --> 08:19.767
-You want a good laugh?
-Dan. we have a little situation here.

08:19.943 --> 08:23.743
Yeah. well. I had a little situation
over there. That Wilson guy...

08:23.914 --> 08:25.514
...he's gaY-

08:26.181 --> 08:28.911
-And?
-And...

08:29.084 --> 08:30.924
ICHUCKLESI

08:32.587 --> 08:35.748
...he thought I was.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.650
Aâ€œ? You?

08:43.230 --> 08:45.960
Give me your vise-grips. Art.

08:46.133 --> 08:49.473
Dan. we have a serious problem.
We are snowed in.

08:51.003 --> 08:55.133
Oh. great. Nothing like being closed up
with scores of criminals...

08:55.308 --> 08:58.398
...and their good friends.
the dregs of the earth.

08:58.577 --> 09:03.407
No. Dan. this could be great. you know.
trapped in here all cozy-like. nothing to do.

09:03.581 --> 09:05.311
It's like a ski lodge.

Jean-Claude Killy. I presume.

09:15.192 --> 09:17.322
The most important thing
is we get organized...

09:17.494 --> 09:19.594
...before we tell them.
so they don't panic.

09:19.763 --> 09:22.493
Mac. go to the commissary.
and check on the food situation.

09:22.666 --> 09:26.356
I believe it's Mexican fiesta night. sir.

09:26.536 --> 09:27.996
I mean see what they have left.

09:28.171 --> 09:30.761
-There must be over a hundred people.
-Right.

09:31.239 --> 09:34.699
Dan. go to the civil-defense shelter
in the basement and check on blankets.

09:34.876 --> 09:36.536
I hope they're not rough.

09:36.711 --> 09:39.481
My skin can't take anything rough.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.074
I think we can fit a dozen or so
comfortably in the office...

10:14.247 --> 10:16.737
...and then four or five in the file room.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.636
-And--
-What's that?

10:18.817 --> 10:21.977
-The power lines are frozen.
They're starting to snap one by one.

10:22.154 --> 10:24.124
We're gonna be without lights?

10:24.289 --> 10:27.549
No. the emergency generator
will take care of everything.

10:28.726 --> 10:30.446
Except the elevators.

-All of it?

10:56.053 --> 11:00.423
Yep. right down to the rancid little leaves
of lettuce they stick under the Jell-O.

11:02.526 --> 11:05.426
This is it.

11:05.862 --> 11:09.092
-For the floor?
-For the building.

11:10.100 --> 11:13.560
-You wanna hear the alternatives?
-No. I'm not ready for that.

11:16.440 --> 11:20.000
Oh, I'll start the bidding at $50.

11:20.644 --> 11:23.054
Have you told them
about our situation yet?

The police have asked this
of every building in Manhattan.

12:00.913 --> 12:03.683
The blizzard has effectively shut down
the city.

12:04.484 --> 12:07.924
New York is closed?

12:08.187 --> 12:09.877
Afraid so.

12:10.056 --> 12:13.216
The building manager has asked.
for safety and management reasons...

12:13.392 --> 12:16.522
...that everyone remain
on the floor they're on now.

12:18.264 --> 12:21.394
What about food?

12:22.401 --> 12:24.931
That's a logistic
we're gonna take care of right away.

12:25.271 --> 12:27.171
I'm hungry-

12:28.107 --> 12:30.007
I bet.

12:30.176 --> 12:35.436
Your cooperation in this matter
is greatly appreciated.

12:36.882 --> 12:39.372
I hope they're not armed.

12:40.018 --> 12:41.878
You know. I seen this movie once...

12:42.053 --> 12:45.513
...where the survivors of an airplane crash
had to resort to cannibalism...

12:45.690 --> 12:47.320
...just to stay alive.

12:49.093 --> 12:51.563
They held a lottery to see who'd be first.

12:52.762 --> 12:56.062
You crazy. We only been trapped
in here five minutes.

12:57.033 --> 12:58.763
Oh. yeah. you're right.

12:58.934 --> 13:01.934
That was my own fault
for skipping breakfast.

13:04.173 --> 13:07.233
-More news.
-Good or bad?

13:07.409 --> 13:10.139
I'm not sure.
Fie|ding's stuck in an elevator.

13:11.947 --> 13:13.967
I'm not sure either.

13:14.148 --> 13:16.908
Oh. that guy Wilson's stuck
in there with him too.

13:17.285 --> 13:19.745
You are kidding.

13:20.054 --> 13:22.354
-The guy with the poodle?
-Yeah.

13:22.756 --> 13:26.816
Turns out that Wilson is gay. right?
So anyway he thinks that Dan is gay.

13:26.993 --> 13:29.863
And he must've said something to Dan
because Dan went crazy...

13:30.030 --> 13:32.690
...and wondered
how the guy could think that.

13:34.801 --> 13:39.141
These are the days of our lives.

13:41.341 --> 13:43.441
Hello. Hello.

13:49.549 --> 13:51.039
What's your first name?

13:52.719 --> 13:55.809
Dan. But my friends call me Killer.

13:58.258 --> 13:59.948
We could be here quite a while. Dan.

14:01.127 --> 14:03.817
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

14:04.564 --> 14:07.164
It means.
why don't we be civil to each other?

14:07.333 --> 14:10.203
It might make

14:11.270 --> 14:15.100
You will get no pleasant situations
from me.

14:16.274 --> 14:17.614
Are you really that stupid?

14:18.909 --> 14:21.809
That's for me to know
and for you to find out.

14:22.746 --> 14:25.646
And I thought I disappointed my father.

Yeah. I guess. He hasn't made a move yet.

14:40.329 --> 14:42.459
-Mr. Wilson?
WILSON: I'm fine.

Hey. listen. creep.

We're doing everything we can.

-Great.

Well. back to the old drawing board.

-We almost had a riot.

15:44.353 --> 15:48.483
Somebody started a rumor that there was
a box of Milk Duds in the building.

15:48.657 --> 15:51.287
I don't blame them.
I'm getting kind of hungry myself.

15:51.460 --> 15:54.330
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Why don't we all sing some camp songs?

15:55.763 --> 15:58.763
Battle fatigue. I saw it in Nam.

15:58.933 --> 16:01.563
What's the matter with you?
It would be great for morale.

16:01.736 --> 16:05.066
Sing-alongs warm the spirit.
which. in turn. warm the body.

-This is the perfect place.

-Thank you.

We're going to a hootenanny.

Hope Simone's all right. She hates the cold.
I left her a little sweater at home.

about stereotypes...

How'd you do?

16:52.350 --> 16:57.480
-A hundred and forty thousand?
-Yeah. And. by the way. I can't stand dogs.

16:57.655 --> 17:01.145
What about Simone?
And her little sweater?

17:01.626 --> 17:03.586
That's business. Fielding.

17:03.762 --> 17:06.031
The little bitch is an investment.

17:06.431 --> 17:09.560
I'd dress her up in mink
if I thought it'd increase my profits.

17:11.167 --> 17:13.498
You're my kind of guy. Wilson.

17:19.242 --> 17:21.873
I don't believe I just said that.

That's ironic. isn't it?
You and me being stuck here.

17:27.416 --> 17:30.647
I've had nightmares
about situations like this.

17:30.987 --> 17:32.007
That's normal.

What's normal?

17:35.792 --> 17:38.422
To consider an alternative lifestyle.

17:38.594 --> 17:42.864
I wasn't considering anything.
It was a terrible dream.

17:43.032 --> 17:45.472

Bull dug a tunnel in the snow
out through the second-floor window.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.850
He said he was gonna get some food.
Well. he only got out about 6 feet...

18:35.016 --> 18:38.876

-Mac. call the fire department.

18:39.054 --> 18:41.254

I'm sure he's gonna be just fine.

Oh.

Don't worry. it won't bite.

19:28.999 --> 19:32.439
You said "former."
What'd he do. ditch you?

19:33.270 --> 19:35.800
In a way. He died.

19:37.407 --> 19:40.307
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay. Forget it.

19:41.978 --> 19:42.998
What happened to him?

19:43.179 --> 19:45.739
Same thing happens to a lot of guys:
Worked too hard...

19:45.916 --> 19:47.636
...smoked too much. didn't exercise.

19:49.118 --> 19:50.708

if we change the subject?

Sure. Sure.

I got a little sarcastic...

20:23.347 --> 20:25.777
-Attractive.
