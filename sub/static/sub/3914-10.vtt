-Kh|yen.
-You found him?

00:10.886 --> 00:12.797
JOHN: We rerouted
his neuro-Iink
to track him.

00:12.888 --> 00:15.470
DUTCH: The RAC is in the most
heavily fortified station
in the Quad.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.048
JOHN: But the good news
is our badges get us in
the front door.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.595
Ijust want to know
who's protecting her.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.721
Dutch doesn't
need protecting.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.598
Then why is she
marked for Red 17?

00:22.689 --> 00:24.475
The Company will drop
all charges against you

00:24.566 --> 00:28.275
in exchange for a
future favor of my choosing.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.982
You could wipe out
an entire bloodline

00:31.114 --> 00:32.729
or target just one
person in the crowd.

ALVIS: Waris what they
call it when the big dogs win.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.158

00:36.286 --> 00:37.321

with that.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.410
You might as well believe
in monsters and Level 6
Killjoys.

00:39.498 --> 00:43.662
Alvis Akari, you're
under arrest for orchestrating
the Leith Bazaar massacre.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.705
I'm an agent.
We're on the same side.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.127
I'm not so sure we are.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.005
We're not.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.291

Alvis in Westhole.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.292
What's the charge?

01:28.380 --> 01:29.540
Sedition and mass murder.

01:29.673 --> 01:33.382
They're saying he
ordered the Bazaar attack.
When it rains it poops.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.796
Come on, we all know
Alvis hates the Company.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.627
He'd never kill civilians.

01:37.723 --> 01:41.591
I got nothing against
the freaky little bastard,
but he is a revolutionary.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.848
He's saved our asses
a dozen times and never
asked for anything in return.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.353
He's being setup.
Why?

01:47.524 --> 01:48.764
Things have been tense
leading up to claim day.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.601
The Company could
be using Alvis
to send a message,

01:51.695 --> 01:54.186
remind everyone who's boss.
Now, if that's what this is,

01:54.531 --> 01:56.146
they'll cut him loose
once they've made their point.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.902
Great, well,
let's pray
for that, then.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.900
We've got enough
on our plate right now.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.199
Khlyen told me something
when lwas leaving.

02:03.707 --> 02:06.915
He said I needed my team,
that something was coming.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.122
I think he meant to the Quad.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.420
Like what?
That's all he said.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.050
I think maybe
you should leave.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.879
Maybe you should leave.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.050
No.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.255
I mean both of you, take Lucy,
be a moving target.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.219
You stole his shit,
he's going to
come looking for you.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.096
So, we better make sure
we're ready for when he does.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.434
How?
Well, first,

02:26.563 --> 02:28.645
I need to know everything
about Khlyen, Level 6...

02:28.732 --> 02:30.222
Red 17.
What?

02:30.651 --> 02:31.936
Turin brought it up.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.063
He said you're on
some kind of a list.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.941
Seriously?
JOHN: That's
in play now? Great.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.405
I mean, I...
I need a chart.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.073
I need to find out
how we're all connected,

02:40.243 --> 02:41.904
so our goal still
remains the same.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.736
Johnny, if yourfriend,
Carleen, can decrypt
Khlyen's files,

02:44.831 --> 02:46.822
we can figure out
what makesa Level 6
vulnerable

02:46.917 --> 02:49.784
and use his
secrets against him
before he gets to us.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.248
This is it.

02:52.756 --> 02:53.962
One last play.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.464
We win here,
or I lose for good.

Old Town is going
to lose her shit.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.957

coerced that confession.

have to use

So, with Westerley,
they took precautions.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.708
Including building a network
of self-sustaining
bunkers underground

07:49.803 --> 07:51.043

forgot about.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.294

without a Companyjob.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.432
Illegals stay in Westerley,
they can't afford to leave.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.603
They spend their
whole lives down here.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.944
I don't see Alvis.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.441
Alvis couldn't
make it, he's...

11:39.574 --> 11:41.110
RAT KING: I know
where he is, Auntie.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.109
It still doesn't explain
why I should trust you.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.906
Because Alvis does.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.456
We need the codes.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.697
We can trade
anything you want.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.757
You want to
prove yourselves,
prove your faith.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.467
DUTCH: HOW?

12:01.930 --> 12:03.545
This is my sister, Rena.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.472
The fever burns through her.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.555
I was hoping to
appeal to Alvis
for a blood blessing.

12:14.651 --> 12:15.982
Bless her.

holy supplies.

just more imposters.

how to fake your
own last rites.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.968

from a home that
we've forgotten.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.137
Finding soil on Qresh.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.847
And the roots grew.

12:58.695 --> 13:02.233
to two moons,
one mother tree
to unite us all.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.529
And when we rise,
her branches hold us.

13:06.911 --> 13:10.244
And when we tire,
her trunk shelters us.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.830
And when we die,

13:18.214 --> 13:20.421
her roots will carry us home.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.059

your people using them?

13:56.586 --> 13:59.749
Alvis says they're holy,
to be saved for
the end of days.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.711
But honestly, we've
been trapped down
here long enough.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.714
I'm ashamed I doubted you.

14:08.806 --> 14:12.765
That's okay,
you're forgiven.

and ears everywhere.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.483
Three Scarbacks
were beaten
outside of our tunnels

14:23.613 --> 14:24.819
just before
the Leith massacre.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.687
They were stripped
naked by three men,

14:26.866 --> 14:28.606
who threw their
own tags and clothes

14:28.701 --> 14:32.319
into the sewers
as they changed
into stolen robes.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.950
I thought you were involved
until the blessing.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.957
Yeah, and Alvis
would never use
imposter monks.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.625
This has "false
flag" all over it.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.747
We need to get this to Hills,

14:40.838 --> 14:43.124

to buy Alvis
some more time.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.125
Thank you.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.135
Shit, I'm... Hey,
I'mjust going
to say it.

You need to take your sister
to get a real blessing.

On whether to allow
Seventh Generation Westies

15:47.447 --> 15:48.482

15:48.573 --> 15:51.110

Not our fault.

Leith is terrified
of you little
rampaging Westerlyns.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.291
We need to look like
we’re hearing them.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.122
I'm not a Westerlyn
and something tells me

16:08.217 --> 16:10.629
it's not radical Scarbacks
Leithians should be afraid of.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.138
Oh, well, / would love
to hear your theories

wasn't a request.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.928
Or have you forgotten
your debt to me?

16:22.857 --> 16:23.972
I have not.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.941
So, get those
tight pants of yours
to Qresh immediately,

16:27.028 --> 16:30.236

I previously did for you

16:30.323 --> 16:32.905

37:12.689 --> 37:14.145
We can't leave,
he's not here.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.733
LUCY: Still no response
from D’avin.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.682
Well, then, what the hell
are you good for? Find him.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.984
LUCY: John, the bombers
are almost here.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.566
Don't say it.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.238
Dutch, he's a good soldier.

37:25.118 --> 37:27.450
He knows to go to ground.
He's probably already in
the tunnels.

37:28.621 --> 37:29.906
And if he's not?

37:30.373 --> 37:32.034
He wanted to leave,
I said no.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.615
He would still
want us to go.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.076
I'm always telling him
to have faith in you,

37:36.254 --> 37:37.790
now, we need to
have faith in him.

37:43.678 --> 37:44.793
Go.

37:46.556 --> 37:47.887
Be safe, D'av.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.180
Alright, everyone
hold onto their ponats.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.564
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

39:43.339 --> 39:45.079
Khlyen's got him.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.086
We don't know that.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.505
The last thing
D'avin mentioned
was seeing him.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.305
LUCY: John, incoming
automated message
from Carleen.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.598
I'll take it in
my room, Loose.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.156
Lucy?
Yes, Dutch?

40:12.243 --> 40:13.949
I want to record a message.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.286
I want you to broadcast
it on loop to D'avin.

40:17.373 --> 40:18.408
D’avin is not receiving.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.453
Shutting up.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.584
I know you're out there.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.922
(PANTING)

40:33.806 --> 40:36.183
And / know that
you’ll eventually hear me.

41:29.487 --> 41:34.151
D'AVlN: Qresh, Leith,
Westerley.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.874
DUTCH: Wherever
