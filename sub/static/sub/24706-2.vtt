NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> NYPD Blue:

00:04.053 --> 00:05.406
l don't want you testifying.

00:05.573 --> 00:08.849
She called the DA behind my back.
Said she'd take six on a plea.

00:09.053 --> 00:11.408
-Janice. . . .
-Gina Zarone can put you in jail.

00:11.613 --> 00:13.444
Want me to voucher
that for lntelligence?

00:13.653 --> 00:16.486
No, let me do it, and l'll do it
when we get back, all right?

00:16.693 --> 00:18.285
SlPOWlCZ:
l've gone to AA.

00:18.493 --> 00:22.486
l did 90 meetings in 90 days.
So l'd like to resume seeing you.

00:22.693 --> 00:26.481
We will give you 1 00K for an
exclusive interview after the trial.

00:26.653 --> 00:28.769
-Not interested.
-lAB's looking at you.

00:28.973 --> 00:30.247
They had a guy on me at court.

00:30.573 --> 00:33.406
KELLY: Police! Police! Against the wall!
SlPOWlCZ: Turn around!

00:33.613 --> 00:35.205

KELLY: Andy, book our friends.
l gotta talk to Fancy.

00:38.453 --> 00:41.490
-You had no idea this was cops, huh?
-No idea.

00:41.693 --> 00:44.526
lf you were set up on cops,
we should have been notified.

00:44.733 --> 00:46.052
l told you, we had no idea.

01:02.453 --> 01:07.243
l'll tell you why you're upset, Darryl.
Because you believe in the right things.

01:07.413 --> 01:09.973
l used to. l don't know
what happened to me.

01:10.173 --> 01:12.004
You think he's happy
about what happened?

01:12.213 --> 01:14.124
You happy, detective?

01:15.773 --> 01:17.570
KELLY:
l'm just doing the DD5.

01:17.733 --> 01:19.963
l'm just saying,
no one's happy with the situation.

01:20.173 --> 01:23.848
-We want everybody on the same side.
-l think it's too late for that.

01:24.013 --> 01:25.446
l don't think that's true.

01:25.613 --> 01:28.446
lt's never too late. Right, detective?

01:28.893 --> 01:30.690
Just do what you gotta do.

01:30.893 --> 01:34.169
-Here you go.
-No.

01:40.493 --> 01:43.451
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:43.733 --> 01:46.725
-Did you get some sleep last night?
-Couple hours.

01:48.333 --> 01:51.643
-You here for their statements?
COSTAS: On standby.

01:51.853 --> 01:54.003
lAB still thinks they're gonna
give names.

01:54.173 --> 01:58.405
Then they're gonna go over to the
switching yard and root for a train wreck.

02:01.573 --> 02:06.089
-On dinner, l was thinking Georgetti's.
-Fine.

02:06.413 --> 02:11.441
-Unless you think someplace else.
-No, Georgetti's is good.

02:12.293 --> 02:16.047
-l'm looking forward to it.
-Me too.

02:18.653 --> 02:21.690
-Morning, John.
-Morning, Andy.

02:22.813 --> 02:24.963
-See you.
-Yeah.

02:29.293 --> 02:31.090
l've got no place to work.

02:31.293 --> 02:34.808
They'll need our desks for
the foreseeable future, analyzing files.

02:34.973 --> 02:37.282
They'll start with World War ll.

02:37.733 --> 02:41.169
-You get your 5 in?
-Last night.

02:42.333 --> 02:47.043
John, when they were done on the bust,
they got onto you and Licalsi.

02:47.413 --> 02:49.165
Marino ledger.

02:49.333 --> 02:53.326
Stuff like, if it's Medavoy's case,
how come you held the ledger?

02:54.173 --> 02:57.882
-Got me in their cross hairs.
-l need your statement, John.

02:58.533 --> 03:02.082
-l don't have a place to type one.
-l'll take an oral statement if you want.

03:02.533 --> 03:06.811
-No, thanks.
-Our problem is your failure to notify.

03:07.013 --> 03:09.971
l'll say this to you once more.
We didn't know they were cops.

03:10.173 --> 03:13.131
l don't see you setting up
because some dealer got robbed.

03:13.333 --> 03:16.291
We set up because civilians
were getting hurt.

03:16.493 --> 03:21.886
What were we doing, Brigham? Running
a shakedown? Busting cops to cut in?

03:22.093 --> 03:24.288
BRlGHAM: Lower your voice.
-You calling us dirty?

03:24.453 --> 03:26.967
-Why don't you say it.
-l'll tell you this much. . .

03:27.173 --> 03:31.564
. . .if you weren't, pray these guys flip.
Now you got dick-fist off failure to notify.

03:31.773 --> 03:35.402
-l got dick-fist, huh? l got dick-fist?!
-We got a homicide.

03:35.813 --> 03:37.690
Come on.

03:38.853 --> 03:42.050
-Let's go do our job. Come on, Andy.
-We'll be here.

03:42.213 --> 03:46.889
lf l got dick-fist, Brigham,
my fist looks like your face.

04:48.253 --> 04:49.971
For Whom the Skell Rolls

05:18.893 --> 05:20.531
Thank you.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.967
Mine's been dead a good eight hours.

05:35.733 --> 05:40.932
See his hands? Defense wounds.
Trying to protect himself, cover his face.

05:41.093 --> 05:43.243
Might have a print on the inside
of the lampshade.

05:43.453 --> 05:45.409
We got a blood trail out here.

05:45.573 --> 05:47.291
SlPOWlCZ:
Come on.

06:09.293 --> 06:13.206
MEDAVO Y: There's some.
SlPOWlCZ: Walk into an apartment.

06:13.733 --> 06:15.166
MEDAVO Y:
Nope.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.608
He's going right out the fire escape.

06:17.853 --> 06:19.445
[HELlCOPTER HOVERS]

06:19.613 --> 06:20.887
There.

06:22.013 --> 06:24.652
SlPOWlCZ: Cut on his right hand. See?
MEDAVO Y: Oh, yeah.

06:24.813 --> 06:27.805
SlPOWlCZ: All right, here we go.
-So, Andy. . .

06:27.973 --> 06:30.441
. . .you and John are with
those busted cops, huh?

06:30.653 --> 06:34.441
-Yeah. Watch yourself, there's blood.
-Yeah, right.

06:34.613 --> 06:36.046
So listen. . .

06:36.253 --> 06:38.483
. . .in reference to John. . .

06:38.973 --> 06:41.203
. . .was lAB. . .

06:41.533 --> 06:43.842
. . .looking at him. . .

06:44.733 --> 06:47.201
. . .in any other reference?

06:47.373 --> 06:50.968
Come on, do better, Medavoy.
There, here's his trail again.

06:51.133 --> 06:53.408
MEDAVO Y:
Uh. . . .

06:53.573 --> 06:55.689
l guess what l was wondering was. . .

06:55.893 --> 06:58.691
. . .are they looking at John
in connection with Linardi?

06:58.893 --> 07:00.246
Yeah.

07:00.973 --> 07:05.330
Where it was my case,
why didn't l have the ledger?

07:05.493 --> 07:07.529
Why didn't l get it those two days?

07:07.733 --> 07:08.413
My impression, one thing and another,
it got turned in a little late.

07:08.413 --> 07:11.962
My impression, one thing and another,
it got turned in a little late.

07:12.173 --> 07:15.882
MEDAVO Y: Right. Yeah, that's right.
One thing and another, l. . . .

07:16.093 --> 07:20.484
l never got around to vouchering it,
never got around to asking him for it.

07:20.653 --> 07:24.009
-You work a case, the paperwork's last.
-Yeah, exactly.

07:24.333 --> 07:28.212
The blood ends here.
He must've drove off or got into a cab.

07:28.373 --> 07:30.648
All right, let's get word to the ERs.

07:30.813 --> 07:34.442
-Walk-ins treated for knife wounds--
WOMAN: Excuse me.

07:34.613 --> 07:36.968
-Get a sample of this blood.
WOMAN: Can l get through?

07:37.133 --> 07:39.647
MEDAVO Y: Yeah, l got it.
-There's some inside here too.

07:39.813 --> 07:41.883
COP: Stay back.
-Why? What's going on?

07:42.053 --> 07:45.489
-Sorry, ma'am.
-l want to go up and mind my business.

07:45.653 --> 07:48.213
COP: l'm sorry, ma'am.
SlPOWlCZ: Excuse me, you live here?

07:48.413 --> 07:51.564
-My cousin does. l was babysitting.
SlPOWlCZ: Who's your cousin?

07:51.773 --> 07:54.731
Barbara Kane, 344.

07:56.013 --> 07:58.083
SlPOWlCZ:
Can l talk to you for a second?

07:58.253 --> 08:00.050
Kids, let me talk to your cousin.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.249
-Medavoy, give me a hand here.
-What happened?

08:02.413 --> 08:04.973
SlPOWlCZ:
Well, l just want to talk to you.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.044
Let's go over here.

08:08.213 --> 08:09.931
Uh. . . .

08:10.933 --> 08:12.571
Listen, there's. . . .

08:13.653 --> 08:17.043
There's no easy way
for me to tell you this.

08:17.333 --> 08:20.803
Something happened in there,
and your cousin got murdered.

08:23.133 --> 08:25.852
Oh, my God!

08:26.933 --> 08:31.529
-Oh, my God!
-Try to pull yourself together if you can.

08:31.693 --> 08:35.368
-Pull yourself together for the little ones.
BO Y: Tanya, where's my mommy?

08:35.533 --> 08:38.923
She's upstairs, baby.

08:39.092 --> 08:42.768
Son, listen, why don't you come
over here with me.

08:43.212 --> 08:45.932
Medavoy, you might look
after her for a second.

08:46.093 --> 08:50.883
Come here, kids.
My name is Andy Sipowicz.

08:51.293 --> 08:54.012
l just want to talk to you for a second.

09:00.213 --> 09:03.410
Miss Licalsi,
tell us what happened. . .

09:03.573 --> 09:06.406
. . .when you met Angelo Marino
that night.

09:06.573 --> 09:08.211
We were in the back of his car.

09:08.373 --> 09:11.524
He asked me why l hadn't
obeyed his instructions.

09:11.733 --> 09:15.123
-And what were those instructions?
-To kill Detective John Kelly.

09:15.293 --> 09:18.251
SlNCLAlR: What was your reply?
LlCALSl: l said, l was working on it.

09:18.613 --> 09:22.003
-And what was Mr. Marino's reaction?
-He was infuriated.

09:22.373 --> 09:25.092
He said that l was
in love with John Kelly.

09:25.573 --> 09:28.087
And was that the truth?

09:28.253 --> 09:30.084
Yes.

09:30.533 --> 09:34.446
What, if anything, did you think
Marino would do at that moment?

09:34.613 --> 09:38.049
l was afraid he'd kill me
and then later kill Detective Kelly.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.047
Did you believe Mr. Marino
and his bodyguard to be armed?

09:41.213 --> 09:44.728
LlCALSl: l knew Tony, his driver,
carried a .38 revolver.

09:45.053 --> 09:47.009
Angelo Marino usually carried. . .

09:47.173 --> 09:47.333
. . .a .45 caliber automatic in the pouch
behind the passenger seat.

09:47.333 --> 09:51.087
. . .a .45 caliber automatic in the pouch
behind the passenger seat.

09:52.013 --> 09:56.609
Knowing them to be armed and fearing
it was Marino's intention to kill you. . .

09:56.773 --> 09:58.491
. . .how did you react?

09:58.653 --> 10:00.723
l panicked.

10:01.453 --> 10:05.492
-l drew my weapon, and l shot both.
-Would it be fair to say. . .

10:05.693 --> 10:08.651
. . .that this was a spontaneous act
born of panic and fear?

10:08.813 --> 10:10.610
Yes.

10:11.373 --> 10:13.091
As you know. . .

10:13.253 --> 10:16.484
. . .someone else,
Alfonse Giardella. . .

10:16.813 --> 10:19.373
. . .confessed to these shootings.

10:19.533 --> 10:22.923
ln effect, you got away
with what you did.

10:23.133 --> 10:25.852
What prompted you to come forward?

10:26.013 --> 10:27.924
l couldn't live with myself anymore.

10:28.093 --> 10:31.051
SlNCLAlR: Were you counseled?
LlCALSl: A priest.

10:31.533 --> 10:33.091
Father Jerry Downey.

10:33.253 --> 10:36.245
How did you come into contact
with Father Downey?

10:36.413 --> 10:40.565
He's John Kelly's parish priest. l'd asked
John if he knew someone l could talk to.

10:40.813 --> 10:44.726
Was giving you the name of his priest
John Kelly's only connection. . .

10:44.973 --> 10:47.806
-. . .with your decision to confess?
-Yes.

10:48.293 --> 10:51.285
John Kelly never knew about any of this.

10:52.453 --> 10:54.205
Nothing further, Your Honor.

10:57.093 --> 11:01.405
Miss Licalsi, you've stated that six days
elapsed between Marino's ordering. . .

11:01.573 --> 11:04.724
. . .you to kill Kelly and the time
you killed Marino and his driver.

11:04.933 --> 11:06.730
That's right.

11:06.893 --> 11:11.364
During that period, since you were
directly disobeying his orders. . .

11:11.533 --> 11:15.970
. . .did it occur to you that the next time
you saw Marino, you might be in danger?

11:16.133 --> 11:18.169
l was worried,
if that's what you mean.

11:18.373 --> 11:21.649
You knew the task he gave you was
important. You knew his reputation.

11:21.853 --> 11:23.047
Yes.

11:23.213 --> 11:26.569
When you were called to the meeting
and knew you'd have to confront him. . .

11:26.733 --> 11:29.486
-. . .how much notice were you given?
-A few hours.

11:29.653 --> 11:33.282
During those hours, Miss Licalsi,
as you anticipated the meeting. . .

11:33.493 --> 11:33.893
. . .with a violent and dangerous man. . .

11:33.893 --> 11:35.929
. . .with a violent and dangerous man. . .

11:36.093 --> 11:40.371
. . .who had turned your life upside down
and was threatening to destroy it. . .

11:40.573 --> 11:44.930
. . .you never considered the act
that could solve all your problems. . .

11:45.173 --> 11:48.404
. . .save the man you loved
and extricate yourself from danger?

11:48.573 --> 11:51.645
l never thought about shooting Marino
until l was in the car.

11:51.853 --> 11:54.890
How could this sense of danger
come to you as a sudden revelation?

11:55.053 --> 11:58.523
You were an experienced officer.
You had successfully conducted a life. . .

11:58.693 --> 12:02.322
. . .of duplicity and secrecy for months,
as you would for months to come.

12:02.493 --> 12:04.211
Was it only during these few hours. . .

12:04.373 --> 12:07.331
. . .that your capacity for planning
and forethought escaped you?

12:07.493 --> 12:11.805
-l don't pretend my behavior made sense.
-There's hard logic to your behavior.

12:11.973 --> 12:14.612
What you did in that car
makes the coldest kind of sense.

12:14.813 --> 12:17.771
ls there a question in there, Your Honor?

12:19.013 --> 12:22.483
Miss Licalsi, as someone with
considerable professional experience. . .

12:22.653 --> 12:25.008
. . .do you believe a woman
who killed two men. . .

12:25.173 --> 12:29.724
. . .would get more favorable treatment if
she appeared to confess with remorse. . .

12:29.893 --> 12:32.805
-. . .or if an ex-lover turned her in?
-Objection. lrrelevant.

12:33.093 --> 12:36.403
-Sustained.
-Nothing further then, Your Honor.

12:37.933 --> 12:40.322
JUDGE:
You may step down, Miss Licalsi.

12:50.253 --> 12:52.608
SlPOWlCZ:
Up here. Let's go.

12:52.773 --> 12:56.766
-l got Fancy.
-Come on, Bernard.

13:01.893 --> 13:05.329
Lieutenant, we've got
a double homicide. . .

13:05.493 --> 13:08.963
. . .black male and female,
both multiple stab wounds.

13:09.133 --> 13:12.728
Found a paring knife at the crime scene.
Could be the murder weapon.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.849
Along with some foil crack pipes.

13:15.013 --> 13:18.483
Trail of blood. He could have used
a car to get away. Picked up a guy.

13:18.933 --> 13:21.242
Neighbors say he was
threatening the female vic.

13:21.453 --> 13:24.286
-Was the guy cut?
-No, not on the hands.

13:24.613 --> 13:26.843
He said he was with another woman
all night long.

13:27.013 --> 13:30.210
She's not home, but Medavoy and
Martinez are looking for her now.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.606
That's the third dealer to pick
Quint and Guyce out of lineups.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.126
KELLY:
Yeah.

13:39.133 --> 13:41.647
-They finger anybody else?
-They're not moving.

13:41.813 --> 13:43.405
They both say it was just them.

13:43.573 --> 13:47.168
-lAB must be thrilled.
-They're waiting for your DD5.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.369
He's conducting an interview
on a homicide.

13:49.533 --> 13:54.084
l don't care if he's conducting the
New York Philharmonic, l want that DD5.

13:54.933 --> 13:58.892
KELLY: Andy's got the interview.
-Use Donna's desk.

14:08.453 --> 14:11.570
-You got a warrant on you, Bernard.
-Look. . .

14:11.733 --> 14:15.521
. . .l admit l got a problem,
a terrible problem with crack.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.292
Parole violation.

14:17.453 --> 14:21.605
-Associating with drug users.
-lt put me in, it jammed me up on parole.

14:21.773 --> 14:25.004
But l hold a job. l'm not robbing,
and l'm not breaking in.

14:25.213 --> 14:28.683
''That bitch Barbara took my
money and didn't bring my rock.

14:28.853 --> 14:30.923
l'm gonna mess that bitch up good. ''

14:31.093 --> 14:33.368
Two witnesses heard you say that
last night.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.485
When l gave her my money
around 8, she said she'd be back.

14:36.653 --> 14:40.282
So when 9:30 rolls around,
l'm mad because the bitch wasn't back.

14:40.493 --> 14:42.324
You got any fresh cuts on you,
Bernard?

14:42.533 --> 14:45.525
No, nothing. Just some old scars.

14:46.893 --> 14:51.364
Oh, look. l wasn't the only one gave
Barbara money. Other dudes did too.

14:51.533 --> 14:54.252
See, you got to understand.
When the weather's okay. . .

14:54.413 --> 14:57.883
. . .that building is wide open.
l mean, it's like one great big party.

14:58.053 --> 14:59.850
People moving in and out all night.

15:00.053 --> 15:04.649
-Music, refreshments. . . .
-People moving one place to the next.

15:04.893 --> 15:06.770
So when she gets
back right before 1 0. . .

15:06.933 --> 15:09.527
. . .l go to this other woman's
crib to watch <b> <i>S</i> </b> <i>tar</i> <b> <i>T</i> </b> <i>rek</i>.

15:09.733 --> 15:13.692
This is Shawanda
that no one can find.

15:15.013 --> 15:16.605
Look.

15:17.613 --> 15:21.208
There was this dude with Barbara when
she came back from copping, okay?

15:21.493 --> 15:24.291
He was with her,
or he followed her.

15:24.453 --> 15:27.013
Or whatever. All l know is
l didn't see him before.

15:27.173 --> 15:30.848
-This isn't Jerome she was killed with.
-No, Jerome was inside her place.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.129
l didn't know him.
He wasn't from the building.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.322
[KNOCKlNG ]

15:34.493 --> 15:35.926
SlPOWlCZ: Yeah?
-You got a second?

15:36.133 --> 15:37.805
Yeah.

15:37.973 --> 15:40.533
You sit tight, Bernard.

15:44.293 --> 15:45.282
Yeah?

15:45.453 --> 15:47.921
Shawanda Wilson.
First she said she was with Bernard.

15:48.093 --> 15:50.482
Then she said
she didn't wanna say anything.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.205
SlPOWlCZ:
Shawanda.

15:53.373 --> 15:57.207
Listen, you know about the murders
at the building last night?

15:57.413 --> 15:58.926
-Don't know nothing.
-Come on. . .

15:59.093 --> 16:02.244
. . .if you were smoking crack,
nobody's gonna give you trouble.

16:02.413 --> 16:05.723
-We want to find who did those killings.
-lt wasn't Bernard.

16:05.893 --> 16:09.442
Because l saw Barbara downstairs when
l come to my door to let Bernard in.

16:09.613 --> 16:13.208
-What time was that?
-About 9:30.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.933
You let him in, he stayed with you,
he never went back out?

16:16.093 --> 16:17.685
Uh-uh.

16:17.853 --> 16:20.651
-What were you doing?
-Fooling around, watching TV.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.413
Yeah? What'd you watch?

16:21.413 --> 16:22.129
Yeah? What'd you watch?

16:22.293 --> 16:24.523
-Why?
-Come on, just tell me.

16:24.773 --> 16:29.722
<b> <i>S</i> </b> <i>tar</i> <b> <i>T</i> </b> <i>rek</i>. Bernard watches the one
with Spock. l like the one with Le Var.

16:29.933 --> 16:33.812
-Right. Okay, thanks.
MARTlNEZ: All right. Come on.

16:35.133 --> 16:38.364
John, this guy didn't do it.

16:38.533 --> 16:41.252
-No cuts?
-No, no cuts. The broad he's banging. . .

16:41.413 --> 16:44.803
. . .tells the right story. They were both
watching the <b> <i>S</i> </b> <i>tars</i> <b> <i>h</i> </b> <i>i</i> <b> <i>p</i> </b> E <i>nter</i> <b> <i>p</i> </b> <i>rise</i>.

16:44.973 --> 16:49.171
The guy saw someone with the female
different from who she croaked with.

16:49.453 --> 16:52.763
Said she came back with this guy
after she'd copped.

16:52.933 --> 16:56.289
-We'll pick him up on the street.
-Son of a bitch, l'm gonna miss dinner.

16:56.453 --> 16:58.409
This is an incomplete statement.

16:58.573 --> 17:01.326
-How is it incomplete?
-l want detail on why you set up.

17:01.493 --> 17:04.212
l want to know why Tahir
wasn't registered as an informant.

17:04.373 --> 17:06.762
-Why didn't you want that on my 5?
-What did you say?

17:06.933 --> 17:09.970
l have a murder to attend to.
l will fix that later.

17:10.213 --> 17:12.010
You float crap about the ledger. . .

17:12.213 --> 17:15.285
-. . .then you think you dictate schedules?
-l will fix it later.

17:15.453 --> 17:18.411
You're gonna find out
what your position is.

17:18.573 --> 17:20.450
Medavoy.

17:20.613 --> 17:24.321
-You doing an 8 to 4 tomorrow?
-Yes, sir.

17:24.573 --> 17:28.691
After lAB runs lineups on the arrested
officers, make yourself available.

17:29.533 --> 17:32.764
MEDAVO Y: ln what connection?
HAVERlLL: Excuse me?

17:32.933 --> 17:35.367
ln what connection would
l be talking with them?

17:35.533 --> 17:40.163
Just make yourself available, Medavoy.
lAB will tell you the connection.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.331
SlPOWlCZ: Medavoy will stand up.
-They wanna put him in the middle.

17:56.493 --> 17:59.166
BERNARD: People will recognize me.
-Nobody will recognize you.

17:59.333 --> 18:02.564
-We're in a car with smoked windows.
BERNARD: This will help my violation?

18:02.773 --> 18:05.333
Help us find this guy,
it's gonna do you some good. Come on.

18:05.493 --> 18:08.132
Give us somebody in an hour,
l'll give you 20 bucks.

18:08.293 --> 18:10.204
-Give me a minute, John.
KELLY: All right.

18:10.373 --> 18:13.285
So how was the doctor's, Dan?
What'd they say about your hip?

18:13.453 --> 18:15.683
lt's going, like the fenders
on my DeSoto.

18:15.853 --> 18:17.445
What did she say about Georgetti's?

18:17.613 --> 18:20.366
-She's good with that.
-How do you feel?

18:20.533 --> 18:24.765
-Okay. We're working on a homicide--
-You going to a meeting tonight?

18:24.933 --> 18:27.447
-Yeah, l'm gonna try.
-lt's very important for you.

18:27.613 --> 18:30.844
-l am gonna try to make it.
-Nothing is more important than sobriety.

18:31.013 --> 18:32.128
Nothing takes precedence.

18:32.293 --> 18:35.410
l gotta take this guy out.
l'm gonna take Sylvia to dinner.

18:35.573 --> 18:38.212
l will try to make
the frigging meeting, okay?

18:38.373 --> 18:40.762
You think this is a game?
Think you can take a shortcut?

18:40.933 --> 18:43.003
-Dan, come on.
-You're still full of yourself.

18:43.173 --> 18:46.324
You're not giving credit
for 1 8 years of sobriety.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.848
Here, want a shortcut?
Here's 1 0 bucks.

18:49.013 --> 18:52.767
Save yourself three months.
Go out and buy a bottle now.

19:05.613 --> 19:08.081
Oh, man, they gonna know
l'm with the police.

19:08.253 --> 19:09.368
You're a moron.

19:09.573 --> 19:14.124
These are tinted windows. They can't
see in, and we are running out of light.

19:14.333 --> 19:16.403
l see Calvin by the Caddie.

19:16.773 --> 19:20.368
KELLY: What's he got to do with this?
-Nothing. l just know him from the joint.

19:20.573 --> 19:23.041
-You trying to bust my balls, Bernard?
-No.

19:23.253 --> 19:28.452
lf you don't see that guy from last night,
l don't give a rat's ass, so shut up.

19:28.613 --> 19:33.733
-Sylvia couldn't change the time?
-No, she had to go to the 2-5 later.

19:33.933 --> 19:37.767
Couldn't work unless we did it on time.
The dinner's bagged now. lt's bagged.

19:37.933 --> 19:39.810
KELLY: You can do it another night.
-Yeah.

19:40.173 --> 19:42.243
How about your buddy?

19:42.413 --> 19:46.531
Dan? Oh, he's great. He just
stopped in to predict my doom.

19:46.733 --> 19:48.405
l don't see him.

19:48.773 --> 19:51.287
KELLY: Tell you what. lf we have
to come back tomorrow. . .

19:51.453 --> 19:53.683
. . .we lock you up tonight.
You make the decision.

19:54.013 --> 19:56.652

You were in Marino's pocket all along.

21:22.533 --> 21:26.208
lAB's talking to Medavoy tomorrow.

21:26.373 --> 21:29.922
-About the ledger?
-Yeah.

21:35.533 --> 21:37.888
Come here. Come here.

21:55.453 --> 21:58.445
ABRAMS: We've heard a great deal
about the enormous pressures. . .

21:58.613 --> 22:02.686
. . .Miss Licalsi was under. Her worries
for her father's reputation and career. . .

22:02.853 --> 22:04.525
. . .her love for Detective Kelly.

22:04.693 --> 22:06.012
But, ladies and gentlemen. . .

22:06.293 --> 22:10.605
. . .no one made Janice Licalsi
get into Angelo Marino's car.

22:10.813 --> 22:12.451
She had a choice.

22:13.453 --> 22:16.604
As a police officer, she knew
she could have Marino arrested.

22:16.773 --> 22:19.412
She chose not to do that.
lnstead. . .

22:19.613 --> 22:24.607
. . .she became judge, jury
and executioner all in one.

22:26.573 --> 22:31.089
Whether she subsequently came
forward out of genuine remorse. . .

22:31.293 --> 22:35.332
. . .or because her crime was discovered
and was about to be exposed. . .

22:35.493 --> 22:39.725
. . .she is not relieved of her responsibility
for what she did that night.

22:39.893 --> 22:41.733
Even in our age of pass-the-blame
psychologizing. . .

22:41.733 --> 22:43.132
Even in our age of pass-the-blame
psychologizing. . .

. . .feeling like you're in a tight spot. . .

22:45.453 --> 22:50.607
. . .does not qualify as extreme emotional
disturbance as defined by the law.

22:50.813 --> 22:54.601
When Janice Licalsi fired those
five hollow-point shells. . .

22:54.773 --> 22:58.163
. . .she knew exactly what she was doing.
She was getting out from under.

22:58.333 --> 23:01.609
The law describes such an act
as murder with forethought. . .

23:01.853 --> 23:04.811
. . .and it prescribes a price.

23:04.973 --> 23:09.125
lt is your duty now
to exact it.

23:20.453 --> 23:22.842
SlNCLAlR:
Ladies and gentlemen. . .

23:23.013 --> 23:25.288
. . .seventeen months ago. . .

23:25.453 --> 23:28.570
. . .Janice Licalsi
began a desperate attempt. . .

23:28.813 --> 23:31.373
. . .to save her father's career
and reputation. . .

23:31.613 --> 23:34.127
. . .and set in motion a series of events. . .

23:34.293 --> 23:38.366
. . .which culminated in a terrible act
for which she's now on trial.

23:38.533 --> 23:39.693
Per the orders of Angelo Marino. . .

23:39.693 --> 23:41.012
Per the orders of Angelo Marino. . .

23:41.173 --> 23:43.812
. . .who was threatening. . .

23:44.173 --> 23:46.050
. . .to expose her father. . .

23:46.213 --> 23:48.773
. . .for having once been
on the mob payroll. . .

23:48.933 --> 23:52.369
. . .Janice Licalsi transferred precincts.

23:52.813 --> 23:55.008
Per Marino's orders. . .

23:55.173 --> 23:58.370
. . .she surveilled Detective John Kelly. . .

23:58.533 --> 24:01.809
. . .seduced him and won his trust.

24:02.333 --> 24:07.327
Then, as so often happens
in this sort of human tragedy. . .

24:08.493 --> 24:10.006
. . .fate. . .

24:10.173 --> 24:12.482
. . .played a cruel trick.

24:12.653 --> 24:16.692
Janice Licalsi and John Kelly. . .

24:16.853 --> 24:18.047
. . .fell in love.

24:18.253 --> 24:22.007
Then she was ordered. . .

24:22.173 --> 24:24.323
. . .to kill him.

24:25.453 --> 24:28.763
For all her desire to protect her father. . .

24:29.253 --> 24:32.370
. . .Janice Licalsi could never
commit such a repugnant act.

24:32.533 --> 24:38.085
Day after day went by, and still she
failed to carry out Marino's order.

24:38.253 --> 24:40.050
After six days. . .

24:40.213 --> 24:42.568
. . .she was summoned
by Marino to a meeting. . .

24:42.733 --> 24:44.883
. . .in an underground garage.

24:45.053 --> 24:49.046
She knew the meaning of this summons.
She knew that by failing to act. . .

24:49.253 --> 24:51.528
. . .she had put her own life
at risk as well.

24:51.693 --> 24:56.813
As she entered Marino's car, she was
like someone who has gone off a cliff.

24:56.973 --> 25:00.329
At that instant, in fear for her life
as Marino confronted her. . .

25:00.493 --> 25:02.404
. . .Janice Licalsi's instincts took over.

25:02.573 --> 25:07.169
ln a single explosive
and unthinking moment, she reacted.

25:11.693 --> 25:14.127
The woman you are to judge. . .

25:14.293 --> 25:16.204
. . .could not be more different. . .

25:16.373 --> 25:18.489
. . .from those who hide
behind the shield of. . .

25:18.733 --> 25:20.371
. . .victimization. . .

25:20.533 --> 25:23.764
. . .in order to deny
the most egregious acts.

25:23.933 --> 25:28.563
Janice Licalsi is taking responsibility
for her actions.

25:28.733 --> 25:32.408
Janice Licalsi is willing
to pay her debt to society.

25:32.573 --> 25:36.168
All she asks
is that you take into account. . .

25:36.533 --> 25:39.764
. . .the obvious
and undeniable presence. . .

25:40.053 --> 25:45.685
. . .of what the state penal code
calls ''extreme emotional disturbance. ''

25:47.253 --> 25:48.891
lf you believe. . .

25:49.053 --> 25:52.284
. . .that a woman threatened
with her father's destruction. . .

25:52.453 --> 25:56.241
. . .the murder of her lover
and her own likely death. . .

25:56.773 --> 26:02.450
. . .could possibly be subject
to extreme emotional disturbance. . .

26:02.933 --> 26:06.403
. . .then l ask you to do
as the law requires.

26:06.573 --> 26:09.724
l ask you to return the lesser verdict. . .

26:10.373 --> 26:12.250

Let's put that behind us, all right?

28:22.613 --> 28:25.525
Look, they're crucifying John.
l think l got something for him.

28:25.733 --> 28:28.486
-What?
-l've been working for this party.

28:28.653 --> 28:30.803
Actually, she's a madam.

28:31.013 --> 28:34.767
She had me watching her place. One of
her girls was getting harassed by a pimp.

28:34.973 --> 28:38.807
-l need to put food on my table.
-All right, come on, what happened?

28:39.093 --> 28:42.881
So me and the madam become pals.
l sit with her in the living room at nights.

28:43.093 --> 28:45.004
We chew the fat.

28:45.173 --> 28:49.086
Then one night a trick calls up
asking for Suzie and Denise.

28:49.413 --> 28:53.008
Break out the teenage-schoolgirl outfits.

28:53.653 --> 28:58.090
-Norval Grolsch, Andy.
-Who the hell is that?

28:58.293 --> 29:00.011
Norval Grolsch. . .

29:00.173 --> 29:02.004

29:02.213 --> 29:04.283
. . .Norman Gardner.

29:04.493 --> 29:09.283
Who, blow-hard newscaster
asshole that he is. . .

29:09.493 --> 29:14.169
. . .turns out he likes
his headmaster act on tape.

29:15.053 --> 29:16.406
Now. . .

29:16.573 --> 29:18.768
. . .l owe John.

29:20.253 --> 29:23.211
You tell him if he wants to use this,
he's welcome to it.

29:23.373 --> 29:27.969
Yeah. Well, if he doesn't,
somebody else might.

29:41.373 --> 29:43.728
When's lAB coming for me?

29:44.093 --> 29:46.971
This is like the Chinese water torture.

29:47.173 --> 29:49.528
-Try to relax.
-Yeah, sure.

29:49.693 --> 29:54.687
Gregory. This is gonna be all right.
You did nothing wrong with that ledger.

29:55.053 --> 29:56.930
Neither did John.

29:58.533 --> 30:01.605
l'm just afraid l'm gonna stammer.

30:02.773 --> 30:05.048
You're gonna do fine.

30:05.213 --> 30:09.001
Yeah, but if l stammer,
they're gonna think l'm covering up.

30:09.933 --> 30:13.892
Gregory, it's on record
that you stammer.

30:14.053 --> 30:16.567
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

30:17.173 --> 30:20.961
lf they think l'm covering up,
it's gonna louse up John.

30:22.653 --> 30:25.167
l don't want to louse up my friend.

30:33.213 --> 30:34.328
KELLY:
Okay, Reginald.

30:34.573 --> 30:37.246
Since l was in here last,
we firmed up on a few things. . .

30:37.413 --> 30:41.770
. . .and we're looking at you for something
that happened over the weekend.

30:43.173 --> 30:45.004
Let me explain how it goes.

30:45.173 --> 30:48.449
-ls this gonna be an ass-kicking?
-No.

30:48.773 --> 30:50.968
l'm not going to lay a hand on you.

30:51.533 --> 30:53.728
Now, there's two ways
we can go with this.

30:54.053 --> 30:54.853
l've read you your rights,
and you can have a lawyer in here.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.209
l've read you your rights,
and you can have a lawyer in here.

30:58.373 --> 31:02.844
Or you and l can sit here and get
to the bottom of this, because frankly. . .

31:03.013 --> 31:06.289
-. . .l don't think it is how it looks.
-That's right.

31:06.453 --> 31:08.603
So you want to continue
without an attorney?

31:08.813 --> 31:10.690
Yeah.

31:12.573 --> 31:15.770
How do you mean
''it's not the way it looks''?

31:18.493 --> 31:21.007
l've looked into your background.

31:21.173 --> 31:24.722
You've been working consistently
for two years.

31:25.173 --> 31:28.370
You've had some bumps,
but l think you're a decent man.

31:28.533 --> 31:30.524
And l don't think. . .

31:30.693 --> 31:33.685
. . .that you could be living
the way you lived. . .

31:33.853 --> 31:36.287
. . .without character and heart.

31:36.533 --> 31:40.082
l've been working my ass off
for the last two years.

31:40.253 --> 31:45.611
l know. Something set you off in that
apartment. l don't know what it was.

31:45.773 --> 31:51.530
l don't know if somebody was bothering
you, tried to humiliate you. l don't know.

31:51.693 --> 31:53.570
l don't know what happened.

31:54.013 --> 31:57.528
But the bad news is, l have
enough right now to lock you up.

31:57.693 --> 32:01.163
Your blood was all over the place.
And nowadays, Reginald. . .

32:01.333 --> 32:05.884
. . .blood is like a fingerprint.
And people saw you there.

32:07.093 --> 32:12.121
So l can lock you up right now
as a crazy man.

32:13.373 --> 32:16.285
l don't want to do that,
because you're not. . .

32:17.493 --> 32:20.212
. . .because you're a decent guy.
So help me.

32:21.533 --> 32:23.649
Think about it.

32:23.813 --> 32:28.682
Remember what it was that set
you off. Can you do that?

32:30.653 --> 32:32.723
l'll be back.

32:49.413 --> 32:53.372
-Norman, glad you could make it.
-What do you want?

32:53.573 --> 32:56.929
l got something newsworthy
l thought l'd give you first crack at.

32:57.093 --> 32:59.561
Why don't you come on up
to my temporary quarters.

32:59.733 --> 33:00.927

of a ledger belonging to Angelo Marino?

35:13.413 --> 35:15.244
Yes.

35:15.973 --> 35:20.046
-Who turned that ledger in for voucher?
-That was Detective John Kelly.

35:20.493 --> 35:25.408
Your case log shows it was entered
two days following the other evidence.

35:25.573 --> 35:27.450
That was on me.

35:27.613 --> 35:29.331
My logging was interrupted.

35:29.493 --> 35:32.451
l knew Detective Kelly
had the ledger. . .

35:32.613 --> 35:35.047
. . .and l didn't ask him for it
for a couple of days.

35:35.213 --> 35:38.091
What interrupted your logging?

35:38.253 --> 35:41.006
l don't specifically recall.

35:41.173 --> 35:43.562
l was working on other aspects
of the case.

35:43.733 --> 35:47.442
There was no resistance on the part of
Detective Kelly in turning that ledger in?

35:47.653 --> 35:48.802
None whatsoever.

35:48.973 --> 35:54.733
During that two-day period, was Kelly
the only detective with access to it?

35:54.973 --> 35:57.726
l guess you could put it like that.

35:57.893 --> 36:02.444
lt was on me, though, you know.
l just never got around to picking it up.

36:06.493 --> 36:08.768
You guys want anything else?

36:13.213 --> 36:14.805
MARTENS:
No. That'll do it.

36:17.293 --> 36:18.931
Okay.

36:27.093 --> 36:32.884
Listen, man. l'm 33 years old.
l did 1 4 years in jail.

36:33.213 --> 36:37.331
l did one to four, cost me 1 8 months
for a hardware-store robbery.

36:37.613 --> 36:39.126
l got back out.

36:39.293 --> 36:42.683
l did four more because
the hardware-store guy said l tried. . .

36:42.853 --> 36:47.404
. . .to stick him up again
just to get me out of the neighborhood.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.291
Third time. . .

36:49.453 --> 36:52.411
. . .l get halfway through
a grocery-store robbery. . .

36:52.573 --> 36:56.532
. . .get scared.
That's when l get grabbed.

36:57.293 --> 36:59.682
l been out two years.

36:59.853 --> 37:01.969
l've worked hard.

37:02.133 --> 37:06.012
l been working day and night
because l didn't want to go back.

37:07.013 --> 37:09.163
But l. . .

37:10.213 --> 37:13.091
. . .go up there to that building.

37:13.253 --> 37:17.007
You know the way it is,
it's like a damn cellblock.

37:18.093 --> 37:22.006
People with their doors open,
women inside.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.323
You just start talking.

37:25.133 --> 37:29.285
You reach into your pocket,
get some money for the rock stars.

37:29.453 --> 37:33.332
That's what they call themselves,
rock stars.

37:33.493 --> 37:36.166
All they want to do
is smoke that crack.

37:37.773 --> 37:39.570
l go in.

37:40.493 --> 37:42.449
l smoke a little.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.089
l see a woman.

37:48.293 --> 37:50.170
And this. . . .

37:51.093 --> 37:53.049
This punk. . . .

37:53.213 --> 37:55.727
This punk. . .

37:55.893 --> 37:58.202
. . .comes up on me.

37:58.373 --> 38:02.571
Don't want me messing with his ho.

38:02.733 --> 38:06.328
So l slapped him like a woman.

38:08.693 --> 38:11.048
He's gonna try and take me. . .

38:13.053 --> 38:14.725
. . .strong-arm me. . .

38:15.453 --> 38:18.047
. . .jump on me.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.363
How'd the people get cut?

38:22.293 --> 38:23.851
He tried to rob me.

38:24.413 --> 38:27.405
-The guy in Barbara's apartment?
-Yeah.

38:28.213 --> 38:33.082
The punk's talking all that stuff,
then he tries to rob me.

38:34.493 --> 38:39.009
l pulled out my 380
and ordered their ass upstairs.

38:39.413 --> 38:44.282
l tied the bitch up with
an electrical cord. Tied her up real tight.

38:44.453 --> 38:46.683
Next thing l know. . .

38:48.013 --> 38:51.289
. . .this punk is gonna try
and jump on me.

38:53.893 --> 38:56.612
So l started punching him. . .

38:56.773 --> 38:58.764
. . .and punching him.

39:02.373 --> 39:04.204
Then l see the knife.

39:09.253 --> 39:11.403
When l broke the skin. . .

39:13.133 --> 39:16.648
. . .with that thing,
l knew l had messed up bad.

39:19.013 --> 39:22.483
These two rock stars were gonna. . .

39:22.653 --> 39:24.803
. . .ruin my whole life.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.806
HAVERlLL:
Forget about it.

39:29.973 --> 39:32.168
Bernard Jenkins goes
back into the system.

39:32.493 --> 39:36.645
l made a deal with him. l gave him my
word. He led us to a double murderer. . .

39:36.813 --> 39:40.010
-. . .because l said l'd help him out.
-You don't get to make deals.

39:40.173 --> 39:42.892
-That's why you have supervisors.
-l can't do my job. . .

39:43.053 --> 39:47.365
-. . .unless my word is good on the street.
-Maybe there's a message in that.

39:47.533 --> 39:49.171
You know, you make me sick.

39:49.333 --> 39:52.166
Take a few tests, you kiss asses,
think that makes you a boss?

39:52.333 --> 39:54.085
-John.
-You think that makes you a boss?

39:54.253 --> 39:55.242
FANCY:
John!

39:58.773 --> 40:02.846
Give Bernard Jenkins his deal.
Kelly just gave me what l need.

40:16.693 --> 40:18.172
MAN:
Be seated.

40:22.013 --> 40:24.527
l understand you've reached a verdict.

40:24.693 --> 40:27.605
Miss Foreperson, have
you reached a verdict?

40:28.373 --> 40:31.683
-Yes.
-Will the defendant please rise?

40:34.093 --> 40:37.449
How say you as to the first count
of murder in the second degree?

40:37.773 --> 40:40.446
-Guilty or not guilty?
-Not guilty.

40:40.733 --> 40:42.724
How say you to the second count. . .

40:42.893 --> 40:45.487
-. . .of manslaughter in the first degree?
-Guilty.

40:46.373 --> 40:48.603
JUDGE:
ls that the verdict of the jury?

40:49.413 --> 40:50.641
Ladies and gentlemen. . .

40:50.813 --> 40:54.328
. . .thank you for your patience
and service in this very difficult trial.

40:54.533 --> 40:57.889
The people of New York State
are grateful. You are now excused.

40:58.213 --> 41:01.603
Bail will be continued pending sentence,
and court is adjourned.

41:04.773 --> 41:08.322
Two years max,
work release in six months.

41:09.133 --> 41:12.045
Not bad for a shyster mouthpiece.

41:31.573 --> 41:35.043
-Thanks.
-The meal they said would never happen.

41:36.253 --> 41:41.168
-l'm sorry about all the delays.
-That's okay.

41:43.733 --> 41:45.132
Excuse me.

41:45.293 --> 41:49.445

like olive oil? lt's cut up into little cubes.

41:49.653 --> 41:51.530
-<b> <i>F</i> </b> <i>o</i> <b> <i>c</i> </b> <i>a</i> <b> <i>cc</i> </b> <i>ia.</i>

41:57.813 --> 42:00.327
-Sorry.
-Andy, it's okay.

42:00.493 --> 42:03.565
No. Part of the reason we came here
is because you like that bread.

42:03.733 --> 42:05.212
lt doesn't matter.

42:06.973 --> 42:09.885
l'll try the <b> <i>p</i> </b> <i>ane marino.</i>

42:48.333 --> 42:51.405

42:51.573 --> 42:53.962
. . .or with this bread here.

42:54.133 --> 42:56.931
Couple of years ago,
that's a three-alarm fire.

l'm proud of your self-control.

43:00.613 --> 43:02.126
