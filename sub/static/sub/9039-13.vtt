HOW ABOUT
WE DON'T INTERFERE

05:20.400 --> 05:22.067
AND LET HER LIVE
HER OWN LIFE?

05:22.067 --> 05:24.467
MAYBE WE COULD SET
AN EXAMPLE.

05:28.900 --> 05:32.300

10:50.067 --> 10:52.267
- ALLY'S BEEN PICKING ON
JUDY FEENY.

10:52.267 --> 10:54.167
- ALLY?
MY ALLY?

10:54.167 --> 10:55.600
ALLY BARONE?

10:55.600 --> 10:57.300
- YEAH.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.433
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

10:59.433 --> 11:00.933
THIS ONE?

11:00.933 --> 11:02.533
THE LITTLE BALLERINA THERE?

11:02.533 --> 11:05.600
- YEAH, YEAH.
THEY'RE ALL ANGELS.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.567
- ARE YOU SURE THAT IT'S ALLY
MAKING THE TROUBLE, 'CAUSE...

11:08.567 --> 11:10.400
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE LOOKING
IN THAT MIRROR,

11:10.400 --> 11:13.433
EVERYTHING'S REVERSED.

11:13.433 --> 11:15.800
- JUDY FEENY WEARS
THESE BIG THICK GLASSES,

11:15.800 --> 11:19.033
AND YOUR LITTLE ALLY
SAYS SHE LOOKS LIKE AN OWL.

11:19.033 --> 11:20.233
- OKAY, WELL...

11:20.233 --> 11:22.633
- SO SHE, UH, HOOTS AT HER.

11:22.633 --> 11:23.767
AND SHE GOES,

11:23.767 --> 11:26.667
"JUDY HOOTIE,
SHE'S GOT COOTIES."

11:26.667 --> 11:29.067
- OH.

11:29.067 --> 11:32.500
OH.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.033
- THE KIDS LIKE TO FIND A WORD

11:34.033 --> 11:35.700
THAT RHYMES
WITH SOMEONE'S NAME,

11:35.700 --> 11:38.633
AND WHEN THEY DO,
THEY JUST NEVER LET UP.

11:38.633 --> 11:41.200
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

11:49.633 --> 11:50.633
- HEY.
- HEY.

11:50.633 --> 11:52.033
I THOUGHT
YOU LEFT FOR WORK

11:52.033 --> 11:53.333
WITHOUT KISSING ME
GOOD-BYE.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.033
- I RODE THE BUS TO SCHOOL
TODAY WITH ALLY.

11:55.033 --> 11:56.267
- YOU DID?
- YES.

11:56.267 --> 11:59.333
AND ALLY'S THE BULLY.
- WHAT?

11:59.333 --> 12:00.900
- WELL, DOTTIE TOLD ME--

12:00.900 --> 12:02.233
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
DOTTIE?

12:02.233 --> 12:06.867
- THE BUS DRIVER.
TAKE AN INTEREST.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.433
ANYWAY, SHE TOLD ME

12:08.433 --> 12:10.033
THAT ALLY'S BEEN PICKING ON

12:10.033 --> 12:11.367
THIS LITTLE GIRL
WITH BIG GLASSES,

12:11.367 --> 12:12.933
CALLING HER AN OWL.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.533
JUDY HOOTIE.
RHYMING.

12:15.533 --> 12:17.867
- HUH.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.367
- THAT'S YOUR REACTION TO,
"YOUR DAUGHTER'S A BULLY"?

12:20.367 --> 12:21.567
"HUH?"

12:21.567 --> 12:22.767
- NO.

12:22.767 --> 12:25.733
IT'S NOT RIGHT,
AND I'LL TALK TO HER.

12:25.733 --> 12:27.100
- THAT'S IT?

12:27.100 --> 12:32.200
YOU SEEM PRETTY
LAISSEZ-FAIRE ABOUT THIS.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.167
- LAISSEZ-FAIRE.

12:34.167 --> 12:36.267
SHE'S JUST BEING A KID.

12:36.267 --> 12:37.867
THAT'S WHAT KIDS DO, HONEY.

12:37.867 --> 12:39.267
- NO, NO, NOT ALL KIDS.

12:39.267 --> 12:40.700
NOT ME.
NOT ROBERT.

12:40.700 --> 12:41.833
NOT LITTLE JUDY HOOTIE,

12:41.833 --> 12:45.267
WHO'S BEEN ACCUSED
OF HAVING COOTIES.

12:45.267 --> 12:47.267
- I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.467
- I DON'T THINK
YOU KNOW YOUR DAUGHTER.

12:50.467 --> 12:51.533
YEAH, YEAH.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.233
CUTE LITTLE FACE,
BLONDE HAIR--

12:53.233 --> 12:54.933
THAT'S HER COVER.

12:54.933 --> 12:56.167
RIGHT?

12:56.167 --> 12:58.133
SHE SEEMS HARMLESS.
OKAY, YEAH.

12:58.133 --> 12:59.533
SHE'S LIKE THE FISH

12:59.533 --> 13:01.300
THAT DISGUISES ITSELF
AS A ROCK, YOU KNOW,

13:01.300 --> 13:02.733
AND THEN YOU SWIM BY...

13:02.733 --> 13:06.000
RRRAHHH!

13:06.000 --> 13:07.767
- SHE'S A NORMAL KID, RAY.

13:07.767 --> 13:10.400
- NO, NORMAL KIDS
DON'T PICK ON OTHER KIDS.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
- WHAT?

13:11.400 --> 13:13.267
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:13.267 --> 13:15.233
YOU WERE A KID.
YOU KNOW.

13:15.233 --> 13:17.033
THE BUS, THE PLAYGROUND.

13:17.033 --> 13:18.833
THOSE ARE ALL TOUGH PLACES.

13:18.833 --> 13:20.900
- WELL, IT TURNS OUT
THEY WEREN'T SO TOUGH

13:20.900 --> 13:22.133
UNTIL SHE SHOWED UP.

13:22.133 --> 13:24.500
- OH...
PLEASE, RAY.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.267
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
JUST WALK AWAY.

13:26.267 --> 13:28.167
YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE
TO POINT A FINGER, BUT...

13:28.167 --> 13:32.100
SHE'S THIS WAY BECAUSE OF YOU.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.433
- EXCUSE ME?

13:33.433 --> 13:34.767
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HEARD ME.

13:34.767 --> 13:36.667
YOU'RE THE ROLE MODEL
FOR HER, NOT ME.

13:36.667 --> 13:37.867
I'M NOT THE WOMAN HERE.

13:37.867 --> 13:39.333
- OH, NO?

13:39.333 --> 13:40.633
- AH, SEE?
RIGHT THERE.

13:40.633 --> 13:42.100
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.633
THAT ATTITUDE,
THAT SMARTY-PANTS,

13:43.633 --> 13:44.733
STICK UP FOR YOURSELF,

13:44.733 --> 13:46.367
DON'T TAKE ANY CRAP
FROM ANYBODY--

13:46.367 --> 13:48.233
- SO YOU'RE ACCUSING ME
OF TEACHING MY DAUGHTER

13:48.233 --> 13:49.633
TO BE SELF-CONFIDENT.

13:49.633 --> 13:50.800
- THAT'S RIGHT.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.700
EVERY JERK I EVER MET
WAS SELF-CONFIDENT.

13:53.700 --> 13:57.133
- YEAH.
NOT EVERY JERK.

13:57.133 --> 13:59.867
LISTEN, I KNOW THE IDEA
OF BEING INDEPENDENT

13:59.867 --> 14:03.500
IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY
YOUR MOTHER RAISED YOU--

14:03.500 --> 14:04.600
- HEY, HEY, HEY.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.333
NEVER MIND
WHAT MY MOTHER DID, OKAY?

14:06.333 --> 14:12.333
AT LEAST I DIDN'T TURN OUT
PUSHY AND MEAN LIKE...

14:12.333 --> 14:13.833
- WHAT?

14:13.833 --> 14:16.467
ME?

14:16.467 --> 14:19.600
YOU THINK
I'M PUSHY AND MEAN?

14:19.600 --> 14:24.300
- YOU WANT TO PUSH ME
RIGHT NOW, DON'T YOU?

14:24.300 --> 14:26.400
- YEAH, YOU'D PROBABLY TATTLE.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.167
- WOW, I'LL TELL YOU,

14:28.167 --> 14:30.733
IT'S A GOOD THING WE DIDN'T KNOW
EACH OTHER WHEN WE WERE LITTLE,

14:30.733 --> 14:32.300
'CAUSE I WOULDN'T
HAVE LIKED YOU.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.900
- I WOULDN'T HAVE
LIKED YOU EITHER, OKAY?

14:33.900 --> 14:36.233
- YEAH, YEAH, STANDING IN
YOUR LITTLE GROUPS AT SCHOOL,

14:36.233 --> 14:37.600
MAKING FUN OF THE KID

14:37.600 --> 14:42.100
WHOSE MOM SHOWED UP
WITH HIS SNOW PANTS.

14:42.100 --> 14:45.367
- [laughing]
SNOW PANTS.

14:45.367 --> 14:50.333
- THERE WAS
A GOOD CHANCE OF SNOW.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.867
SEE?
YOU--YOU'RE BRINGING ALLY

14:51.867 --> 14:53.433
INTO THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

14:53.433 --> 14:58.067
DEBRA BARONE'S
ASS-KICKING INCORPORATED.

14:58.067 --> 15:00.367
PUSHING PEOPLE DOWN
SINCE 1972.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.367
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

15:02.367 --> 15:06.200
THAT'S BETTER THAN WORKING
AT RAY'S HOUSE OF WUSS.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.333
YOU WANT HER TO BE
TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON YOU.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.800
- NO, I DON'T.
- YOU RODE HER BUS TODAY!

15:11.800 --> 15:13.900
- SO--YEAH, AND YOU TAUGHT HER
TO BE SELF-CONFIDENT,

15:13.900 --> 15:16.433
AND NOW SHE'S HANGING KIDS OUT
THE BUS WINDOW BY THEIR ANKLES.

15:16.433 --> 15:17.900
- I TOLD YOU
THAT I WOULD TALK TO HER

15:17.900 --> 15:19.167
ABOUT PICKING ON
THAT LITTLE GIRL

15:19.167 --> 15:20.633
WHEN SHE GETS HOME.

15:20.633 --> 15:22.367
- NO, YOU DON'T TALK TO HER.
YOU'LL SPIN IT.

15:22.367 --> 15:23.800
I'LL TALK TO HER.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.633
- DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK
OR...SOMEPLACE?

15:25.633 --> 15:28.567
- YEAH, YEAH, AND YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT THE KISS GOOD-BYE.

15:28.567 --> 15:30.133
- OH, NO.
WHAT'LL I DO?

15:30.133 --> 15:31.533
- YOU'LL MISS IT, BABY.

15:31.533 --> 15:32.733
- OH, YEAH.

15:32.733 --> 15:37.067
HEY, HEY, LAME-MOND GAY-MOND
GO AWAY-MOND.

15:37.067 --> 15:39.567
- BULLY!

15:39.567 --> 15:41.000
YOU BULLY!

15:41.000 --> 15:43.300
- RELAX.
RELAX.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.433
- DEBRA, DEBRA,
LOVELY WIFE,

15:45.433 --> 15:48.767
WHY AM I STUCK WITH YOU
FOR LIFE?

15:52.367 --> 15:55.200
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE
HAD THAT ONE FOR A WHILE.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.600
- MAYBE.
WHY? WHAT?

15:56.600 --> 15:58.133
YOU WANT ONE
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD?

15:58.133 --> 16:00.833
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

16:00.833 --> 16:04.267
YOU'RE A STUPID IDIOT
STINKER B.M.!

16:16.067 --> 16:18.967
- ALLY?

16:18.967 --> 16:20.967
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:20.967 --> 16:22.233
TRYING TO GET TO HER
BEFORE I CAN?

16:22.233 --> 16:25.200
- [scoffs]
NO.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
LOOKING OUTSIDE?

16:27.600 --> 16:29.867
- I WAS LOOKING--
FOR YOUR INFORMATION--

16:29.867 --> 16:32.233
THERE'S A SHRUBBERY...

16:32.233 --> 16:34.200
THIEF GOING AROUND.

16:37.933 --> 16:40.267
AW, CRAP.

16:40.267 --> 16:45.633
- HI, WE WERE JUST ON OUR WAY
TO THE MARKET, AND I--

16:45.633 --> 16:47.100
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:47.100 --> 16:49.000
- NOTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:49.000 --> 16:52.567
- I SENSE TENSION AND ANGER.

16:52.567 --> 16:56.167
- MAYBE YOU'RE PICKING UP
YOUR OWN SCENT.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.500
- WE'RE FINE, MARIE.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.567
- RAYMOND?

17:08.567 --> 17:11.533
- ALLY'S THE ONE THAT'S BEEN
BULLYING THE KIDS ON THE BUS.

17:11.533 --> 17:12.733
- OH, MY...

17:12.733 --> 17:14.200
- OH, YEAH?

17:14.200 --> 17:17.000
GOOD FOR HER.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.367
WHAT DID SHE DO?

17:18.367 --> 17:20.233
- NEVER MIND.
AND IT'S NOT GOOD.

17:20.233 --> 17:22.200
- HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.500
HEY, TIGER!

17:23.500 --> 17:25.033
- ALL RIGHT,
FRANK, FRANK.

17:25.033 --> 17:27.067
HONEY, I NEED YOU
TO COME OVER HERE

17:27.067 --> 17:28.400
AND SIT DOWN
FOR A MINUTE.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.700
- AL-LY! BOOM-BA-YAY!

17:30.700 --> 17:32.633
AL-LY!
BOOM-BA-YAY!

17:32.633 --> 17:35.233
- STOP IT, FRANK.

17:35.233 --> 17:37.967
HONEY, HAVE YOU BEEN PICKING ON
OTHER CHILDREN?

17:37.967 --> 17:39.200
- OH, MARIE.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.433
- ALLY, DOTTIE TOLD ME

17:41.433 --> 17:43.500
THAT YOU'VE BEEN MAKING FUN
OF JUDY FEENY.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.800
- WHY WERE YOU
ON MY BUS TODAY?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.033
- BECAUSE...

17:48.033 --> 17:49.867
DADDY LOVES YOU
VERY MUCH.

17:49.867 --> 17:52.433
- YECCHH.

17:52.433 --> 17:53.933
- ALL THE KIDS
WERE MAKING FUN OF ME

17:53.933 --> 17:55.200
ON THE RIDE HOME.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.067
- WHICH ONES?
GIVE ME THEIR NAMES.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.267
- LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

17:59.267 --> 18:00.833
- THEY WERE
MAKING FUN OF YOU?

18:00.833 --> 18:02.133
- YES, THEY KEPT SAYING,

18:02.133 --> 18:04.267
"BABY ALLY
AND HER DORKY DADDY."

18:04.267 --> 18:09.367
- [laughing]
YOU'RE DORKY DADDY.

18:09.367 --> 18:11.200
- HONEY, I'M SORRY.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.633
LOOK, I WAS JUST TRYING--

18:12.633 --> 18:13.800
I DIDN'T KNOW--

18:13.800 --> 18:16.000
- DO I HAVE TO RIDE
ON THE BUS TOMORROW?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.467
- LOOK, SWEETIE,
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS,

18:17.467 --> 18:18.867
THOSE KIDS
WILL FORGET ABOUT IT,

18:18.867 --> 18:20.600
AND THEY'LL MOVE ON
TO SOMETHING ELSE.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.767
- I'M GONNA MAKE UP
A MEAN SONG ABOUT JUDY.

18:23.767 --> 18:25.933
- OH, HONEY,
WE DON'T SING MEAN SONGS.

18:25.933 --> 18:27.833
- ALL RIGHT.
MARIE...PLEASE.

18:27.833 --> 18:31.167
ALLY, NOW, I KNOW I TOLD YOU
TO STICK UP FOR YOURSELF.

18:31.167 --> 18:32.633
- BUT--BUT--

18:32.633 --> 18:34.433
- YEAH, SO I'M GONNA
MAKE FUN OF JUDY HOOTIE,

18:34.433 --> 18:36.600
AND THEN ALL THE OTHER KIDS
WILL LAUGH AT HER.

18:43.233 --> 18:46.667
- YOU'RE DOING
A GOOD JOB WITH HER.

18:52.667 --> 18:55.133
- HONEY, WE NEED TO TALK.
OKAY?

18:55.133 --> 18:56.600
- OKAY.
YOU WANT TO?

18:56.600 --> 18:58.067
- NO, YOU GO AHEAD.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

18:58.067 --> 18:59.467
YOU SHOULD DO IT.

18:59.467 --> 19:02.367
- OKAY.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.600
UM...

19:04.600 --> 19:07.767
OKAY, HONEY.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.167
YOU SEE, YOU SAW TODAY

19:09.167 --> 19:13.733
THAT IT'S NOT FUN
TO GET PICKED ON, RIGHT?

19:13.733 --> 19:15.633
AND, UM, YOU KNOW,

19:15.633 --> 19:17.567
THERE ARE A LOT
OF BAD KIDS OUT THERE,

19:17.567 --> 19:21.333
AND--AND YOU
SHOULD STOP BEING ONE.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.467
- DON'T SAY THAT!
- WHAT?

19:23.467 --> 19:24.867
- YOU JUST SAID SHE WAS--

19:24.867 --> 19:26.267
SHE WAS A BAD KID.

19:26.267 --> 19:27.533
- I DID NOT!
- YES, YOU DID.

19:27.533 --> 19:29.433
YOU JUST SAID--
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

19:33.567 --> 19:35.600
THERE ARE A LOT
OF GREAT KIDS OUT THERE,

19:35.600 --> 19:37.267
AND YOU SHOULD TRY
TO BE LIKE THEM.

19:37.267 --> 19:38.600
- ALL RIGHT, RAY, STOP.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.433
WHAT DADDY'S
TRYING TO SAY--

19:40.433 --> 19:44.233
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
INTERPRET FOR ME.

19:44.233 --> 19:45.800
WHAT MOMMY
IS TRYING TO SAY--

19:45.800 --> 19:47.400
- RAY.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.500
- SEE?
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.733
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY, ALLY?

19:57.600 --> 19:59.933
THERE'S A KIND OF FISH
THAT LOOKS LIKE A ROCK.

19:59.933 --> 20:02.767
- OH, RAY, WOULD YOU STOP?
MY GOD.

20:02.767 --> 20:04.267
- DO YOU THINK I'M BAD?
