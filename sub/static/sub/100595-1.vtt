Get your phone!

01:29.746 --> 01:31.780
Hey, get your phone!

01:31.782 --> 01:33.282
Hey, I need your phone!

01:33.284 --> 01:34.783
Ma'am, I need your phone, hey!

01:34.785 --> 01:35.950
- I need your phone.
- Get your phone.

01:35.952 --> 01:36.952
Come on, lady, let's go!

02:03.314 --> 02:04.148
Hey.

02:20.863 --> 02:21.996
Rose!

02:21.998 --> 02:23.333
Give me a hand with this?

02:26.369 --> 02:28.839
Holy shit, almost carjacked.

02:30.373 --> 02:31.208
Watch out!

02:35.511 --> 02:37.681
Fuck!

02:40.985 --> 02:42.854
Get out of the street, Rose.

02:43.687 --> 02:45.255
You could have been killed.

03:07.878 --> 03:10.412
Hey, I can take you.

03:10.414 --> 03:11.545
Mom, it's less than a mile.

03:11.547 --> 03:13.884
Well, weather said
it might storm.

03:15.419 --> 03:16.921
Looks pretty nice out to me.

03:19.723 --> 03:20.725
Okay.

03:22.892 --> 03:24.726
Be safe, okay?

03:24.728 --> 03:25.560
I love you.

03:25.562 --> 03:26.397
I love you too.

03:27.730 --> 03:28.896
I'll be back tonight.

03:28.898 --> 03:29.734
Okay.

03:48.319 --> 03:49.254
Shh!

03:49.586 --> 03:50.421
Sorry.

03:51.421 --> 03:52.256
Hey.

03:58.329 --> 04:00.429
Well, I guess welcome.

04:00.431 --> 04:01.266
Sit.

04:26.789 --> 04:27.823
Did you hear that Harden lost

04:27.825 --> 04:29.790
their star basketball player?

04:29.792 --> 04:32.494
He was hit by a car,
he died right there.

04:32.496 --> 04:34.332
Maybe we'll actually
win this year.

04:35.132 --> 04:35.766
Too soon.

04:39.469 --> 04:41.472
Hey, you just moved here, right?

04:42.806 --> 04:44.342
2626 Pacific?

04:46.008 --> 04:46.943
Mini-Cooper?

04:47.878 --> 04:50.113
Yeah sorry, that was
a really weird day.

04:53.984 --> 04:55.353
Health, me too, come on!

04:58.856 --> 04:59.856
- Slut!
- Slut!

05:03.126 --> 05:05.527
This doesn't look like Room 220.

05:05.529 --> 05:06.497
Relax, you're fine.

05:08.532 --> 05:09.998
It's my first day so I
feel like I should just...

05:10.000 --> 05:11.532
Really, it's Coach Daly.

05:11.534 --> 05:12.469
He doesn't give a fuck.

05:13.169 --> 05:15.372
Plus he likes me, a lot.

05:17.541 --> 05:19.677
So spill it. What's your story?

05:20.510 --> 05:21.511
I don't really have a story.

05:27.851 --> 05:29.184
Right, because moving halfway

05:29.186 --> 05:31.022
through the year
isn't shady as fuck.

05:33.424 --> 05:34.392
How is that shady?

05:35.525 --> 05:37.191
Well, I mean most families wait.

05:37.193 --> 05:39.693
Let you finish out
the school year.

05:39.695 --> 05:41.032
Unless you're running
from something.

05:42.032 --> 05:43.368
It's just my Dad's job.

05:44.534 --> 05:46.600
He got transferred
here so we moved.

05:46.602 --> 05:48.038
Hmm, where'd you move from?

05:48.871 --> 05:50.871
Bangor, Bangor, Maine.

05:51.707 --> 05:53.741
Jesus Christ, don't
let the animals

05:53.743 --> 05:55.443
around here find that out.

05:55.445 --> 05:56.080
Why not?

05:57.214 --> 05:59.047
How many
variations of Bang-her

05:59.049 --> 06:00.582
and your name can you handle?

06:07.056 --> 06:08.558
Oh fuck!

06:09.726 --> 06:11.592
You're not gonna go in
there and get that are you?

06:11.594 --> 06:12.693
It's my lucky pen.

06:12.695 --> 06:14.464
I've used it for like every
test since sixth grade.

06:15.065 --> 06:15.900
Gross.

06:21.604 --> 06:23.741
Yeah, well I've never gotten
less than an A with it.

06:25.108 --> 06:26.077
Really gross.

06:28.611 --> 06:30.614
Is there a reason you
two aren't in class?

06:31.614 --> 06:33.450
Rose got her period.

06:34.618 --> 06:36.921
She should be happy if
she's anything like you.

06:53.270 --> 06:56.474
Scariest movie ever.

07:06.616 --> 07:07.784
Mother fucker.

07:11.787 --> 07:13.787
Is that Lila Larson,
the cheerleader?

07:13.789 --> 07:15.159
More like cheer-cunt.

07:16.292 --> 07:17.627
Or is it cunt-leader?

07:19.296 --> 07:20.229
Who's with her, is that...?

07:20.231 --> 07:21.962
- No one, no one.
- Does he go to our school?

07:21.964 --> 07:23.500
Just, let's get some snacks.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.133
Hey, Biology class, what's up?

07:26.135 --> 07:27.135
Hi.

07:27.137 --> 07:28.302
Do you like your movie?

07:28.304 --> 07:30.304
Yeah, it's a deranged killer

07:30.306 --> 07:32.674
in the woods with a Mom complex.

07:32.676 --> 07:33.708
I mean, what's not to like?

07:33.710 --> 07:35.643
I know right, it's classic.

07:35.645 --> 07:38.179
Great, so we're gonna
take two large popcorns,

07:38.181 --> 07:40.984
a set of drinks, and
some Milk duds please.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.488
Are you guys hiring?

07:46.155 --> 07:47.821
Yeah, yeah, I guess we are.

07:47.823 --> 07:49.691
Are you looking for a job?

07:49.693 --> 07:50.991
My Mom just wants me to get one.

07:50.993 --> 07:51.626
That is awesome.

07:51.628 --> 07:53.328
I can totally hook you up.

07:53.330 --> 07:55.330
That is awesome, I'm actually
looking for a job too

07:55.332 --> 07:56.834
so you can hook both of us up.

08:02.705 --> 08:03.840
You look so happy?

08:04.840 --> 08:05.975
That was a long time ago.

08:06.876 --> 08:09.579
You look so good in pink, you
should wear it more often.

08:10.179 --> 08:11.681
Did you find a movie yet or not?

08:12.181 --> 08:14.715
No, I feel like horror movies

08:14.717 --> 08:16.184
aren't really scary anymore.

08:16.186 --> 08:17.751
Oh, you wanna be scared?

08:17.753 --> 08:19.587
What, are you gonna get a
Ouija board or something?

08:19.589 --> 08:20.558
No, what am I, eight?

08:21.892 --> 08:22.860
Here, give me this.

08:24.695 --> 08:28.866
Um, let's see if this
is scary enough for you.

08:31.368 --> 08:34.038
Okay, I found this game,
47, have you heard of it?

08:34.737 --> 08:35.869
It's a summoning game.

08:35.871 --> 08:37.205
No, I haven't, what is it?

08:37.207 --> 08:39.373
It says it's a two-player game

08:39.375 --> 08:40.575
where you do this weird ritual

08:40.577 --> 08:43.713
and then set a photo timer
on your phone for 10 seconds.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.885
So we're summoning the
dead from our phones?

08:48.919 --> 08:52.220
The iDead!

08:52.222 --> 08:55.223
I don't know, TVs,
mirrors, why not a phone?

08:55.225 --> 08:56.226
It's just a portal.

08:57.627 --> 08:58.595
Doesn't work, but...

08:59.763 --> 09:01.629
Or maybe you're just scared.

09:01.631 --> 09:02.900
No, I'm not scared.

09:03.766 --> 09:04.568
Okay.

09:10.774 --> 09:15.243
First, light a candle
between the two players.

09:15.245 --> 09:16.080
Lame.

09:19.750 --> 09:22.753
You take a piece
of paper and write

09:23.285 --> 09:26.924
"To... the darkness...

09:28.158 --> 09:31.762
...I am bound."

09:33.096 --> 09:34.097
Then....

09:35.164 --> 09:36.099
Uh...

09:37.967 --> 09:38.969
Give me your finger.

09:40.770 --> 09:41.938
Give me your finger!

09:44.441 --> 09:45.276
Ow!

09:48.111 --> 09:50.945
You put a drop of blood from

09:50.947 --> 09:52.650
each player on the page.

09:56.285 --> 10:00.625
Into the flame bound by
blood, bound by darkness.

10:05.294 --> 10:07.664
And then, I need your phone.

10:08.799 --> 10:09.964
Why can't we use your phone?

10:09.966 --> 10:11.168
Just give me your phone.

10:12.836 --> 10:14.138
Okay, it says...

10:15.472 --> 10:17.839
All you have to do is
set the photo timer

10:17.841 --> 10:19.710
on your phone and then..

10:20.876 --> 10:22.844
...and then we pass the
phone back and forth

10:22.846 --> 10:24.845
while saying the
summoning chant.

10:24.847 --> 10:26.150
Whoever it lands on loses.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.017
Okay, from the fires of
Hell we dare you to come

10:29.019 --> 10:31.319
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

10:32.289 --> 10:34.822
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come

10:34.824 --> 10:36.760
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

10:37.861 --> 10:39.159
Hurry, go!

10:39.161 --> 10:40.829
- From the fires of Hell.
- From the fires of Hell

10:40.831 --> 10:42.497
we dare you to come

10:42.499 --> 10:44.669
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

10:45.501 --> 10:47.167
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come

10:47.169 --> 10:48.905
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

10:50.005 --> 10:50.839
From the fires of...

10:54.010 --> 10:56.080
Looks like you lose.

10:58.848 --> 11:00.183
What does it mean if I lose?

11:01.885 --> 11:02.720
Um.

11:03.853 --> 11:05.186
What does it say?

11:05.188 --> 11:07.891
Nothing, you're
right, it's lame.

11:10.193 --> 11:13.364
Looking into the lens, you
are summoning an evil spirit,

11:14.231 --> 11:16.064
taunting it to kill one of you.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.766
And whoever's left
holding the camera

11:17.768 --> 11:21.536
when the photo snaps
will die within 47 hours.

11:21.538 --> 11:24.404
Okay, unless you play the
game with someone else

11:24.406 --> 11:25.473
and the phone snaps
on their picture

11:25.475 --> 11:27.712
and then you pass the
death curse off onto them.

11:28.245 --> 11:29.746
It's just a death curse.

11:31.213 --> 11:32.846
Right.

11:32.848 --> 11:34.548
Oh my God, you don't really
think this is real, do you?

11:34.550 --> 11:36.383
It's just a game, calm down.

11:36.385 --> 11:37.755
Yeah, well you're
not the one who lost.

11:39.222 --> 11:40.388
Okay.

11:43.393 --> 11:45.129
Oh crap, it's
late, I have to go.

11:45.795 --> 11:46.927
Just sleep over.

11:46.929 --> 11:48.229
No I can't, my
parents are really

11:48.231 --> 11:50.230
overprotective since I...

11:50.232 --> 11:52.566
It's a long story, I'll
tell you about it later.

11:52.568 --> 11:54.802
Okay, I mean, you only
live a couple houses

11:54.804 --> 11:55.936
down, what's the big deal?

11:55.938 --> 12:00.240
I know, I'll explain
it another time.

12:00.242 --> 12:01.111
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

12:01.911 --> 12:02.746
Okay.

12:03.579 --> 12:04.579
Bye.

12:04.581 --> 12:05.416
Bye.

15:03.259 --> 15:04.094
Come on!

15:07.597 --> 15:09.129
Hey, can we talk for a second?

15:09.131 --> 15:09.765
Yeah, what's up?

15:11.601 --> 15:13.270
I'm really afraid I'm gonna die.

15:14.471 --> 15:16.771
Oh God, is this
because of the sirens?

15:16.773 --> 15:18.105
Look, I told you, it's Texas.

15:18.107 --> 15:20.141
They go off all the time.

15:20.143 --> 15:22.442
Trisha Harden fell from
the I-20 Highway overpass

15:22.444 --> 15:24.112
onto oncoming traffic.

15:24.114 --> 15:25.115
Shit.

15:26.182 --> 15:27.114
Who's Trisha Harden?

15:27.116 --> 15:29.617
Rachel Grady drowned in her pool

15:29.619 --> 15:31.451
and she was a state
swim champion.

15:31.453 --> 15:33.787
Carla McCann disappeared
and she was presumed dead

15:33.789 --> 15:34.788
after she talked to her parents.

15:34.790 --> 15:37.124
I'm sorry, who are these people?

15:37.126 --> 15:38.294
It's the game, Cadence.

15:39.462 --> 15:42.162
They all just died
after playing the game.

15:42.164 --> 15:44.465
Are you talking
about the phone game?

15:44.467 --> 15:46.135
The game that we
played yesterday?

15:48.670 --> 15:52.040
Oh my God, you're
actually freaking out.

15:52.042 --> 15:53.141
You know it's just
a bunch of stories

15:53.143 --> 15:55.308
made up by some
horror geeks, right?

15:55.310 --> 15:58.146
They're real obituaries,
and people are dead.

15:58.148 --> 16:00.181
People die every
fucking day, okay?

16:00.183 --> 16:02.019
It's not from some
stupid iPhone game.

16:05.188 --> 16:06.019
Look, you spent all night

16:06.021 --> 16:07.488
looking stuff
up on the internet.

16:07.490 --> 16:09.824
That's gonna make
anyone go crazy.

16:09.826 --> 16:11.325
I mean, one time I
got this spider bite

16:11.327 --> 16:13.661
and I spent all night
researching spider bites.

16:13.663 --> 16:15.196
I thought I was gonna die.

16:15.198 --> 16:17.532
I begged my Mom to
take me to the clinic.

16:17.534 --> 16:19.370
But I didn't die, I was fine.

16:20.837 --> 16:22.335
I don't know, the internet
has that affect on people.

16:22.337 --> 16:25.208
There's like a name
for it or something.

16:26.241 --> 16:27.074
This is different.

16:27.076 --> 16:29.343
It's just the
worldwide mind fuck.

16:29.345 --> 16:30.845
Seriously, listen to yourself.

16:30.847 --> 16:34.514
A game we found on the internet
is gonna kill you, really?

16:34.516 --> 16:36.183
Something's already happening.

16:36.185 --> 16:37.685
Is this why you had to
leave your last school,

16:37.687 --> 16:39.023
'cause you're fucking nuts?

16:40.557 --> 16:43.523
I'm just tired and

16:43.525 --> 16:46.096
I think the sirens really
got to me last night.

16:53.535 --> 16:55.235
How old are y'all?

16:55.237 --> 16:56.237
We're 17.

16:56.239 --> 16:57.571
Actually, almost 18.

16:57.573 --> 16:59.373
And if you
read the app it turns

16:59.375 --> 17:01.211
out that I am also a peer tutor.

17:02.544 --> 17:05.048
And I was on the
Wag App for like a week.

17:06.248 --> 17:08.249
You come ready to
work on Thursday.

17:08.251 --> 17:09.716
Don't be late.

17:09.718 --> 17:13.222
If you ain't 10 minutes
early, you're 15 minutes late.

17:16.258 --> 17:18.559
♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪

17:18.561 --> 17:20.764
♪ Let's all go to the lob... ♪

17:42.252 --> 17:43.253
Ugh.

17:54.596 --> 17:57.598
♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪

18:12.448 --> 18:13.350
Cadence?

18:15.784 --> 18:16.620
Hello?

18:19.322 --> 18:20.123
Is anybody here?

19:21.516 --> 19:23.352
Hey, open up!

19:26.355 --> 19:27.388
What's wrong, what's
wrong, what's wrong?

19:27.390 --> 19:28.388
What happened?

19:28.390 --> 19:30.861
A demon, a monster in
there, it attacked me!

19:40.570 --> 19:42.903
Me kill you, Rose!

19:42.905 --> 19:45.876
You die now!

19:46.876 --> 19:48.178
Oh, you're so stupid!

19:56.285 --> 19:57.888
You know what I mean?

20:02.557 --> 20:04.927
Have you ever heard of the
expression "speak of the devil"?

20:05.762 --> 20:08.061
Yeah, like when you talk about
somebody and they show up?

20:08.063 --> 20:10.731
It comes from the idea that
if you speak of the devil

20:10.733 --> 20:12.736
then you're inviting him in.

20:14.437 --> 20:16.240
Okay, where are you
going with this?

20:17.907 --> 20:21.408
I think that when
we played 47 Hours

20:21.410 --> 20:22.912
we were inviting something in.

20:25.480 --> 20:28.081
You don't actually
believe that do you?

20:28.083 --> 20:29.449
Not logically, but...

20:29.451 --> 20:30.751
But what?

20:30.753 --> 20:33.087
I mean, I think that
if I break a mirror

20:33.089 --> 20:35.923
or a black cat walks in front
of me I'm not gonna get hurt,

20:35.925 --> 20:38.426
but I still try my best
to avoid doing that stuff.

20:38.428 --> 20:39.263
Okay.

20:42.598 --> 20:44.432
I mean, you're not even a
little bit superstitious?

20:44.434 --> 20:47.437
No, I own a fucking
black cat, I don't care.

20:49.104 --> 20:52.642
Well, what if I
took your lucky pen?

20:55.477 --> 20:56.446
- And broke it.
- Stop!

20:58.448 --> 20:59.813
See, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

20:59.815 --> 21:01.782
If you can manifest
positivity and good luck

21:01.784 --> 21:03.117
then you can manifest evil.

21:03.119 --> 21:04.517
That's completely different.

21:04.519 --> 21:05.453
How is that different?

21:05.455 --> 21:06.790
This is so stupid.

21:07.823 --> 21:09.122
Cadence, what are you doing?

21:09.124 --> 21:11.492
You don't want the curse
on you anymore, right?

21:11.494 --> 21:12.626
All you have to do is
play with someone else

21:12.628 --> 21:13.797
and have them lose.

21:14.964 --> 21:16.964
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come

21:16.966 --> 21:19.468
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

21:20.636 --> 21:21.769
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come

21:21.771 --> 21:23.674
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

21:24.673 --> 21:25.805
From the fires of
Hell we dare you to...

21:28.977 --> 21:30.511
There you go.

21:30.513 --> 21:31.978
No more curse, no
more freaking out.

21:31.980 --> 21:34.350
You're free to move
about the cabin.

21:35.650 --> 21:40.487
What about the rituals like
the candles and the, what?

21:40.489 --> 21:41.991
I just made that part up.

21:43.159 --> 21:44.361
Okay, thank you.

21:45.495 --> 21:46.994
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

22:01.843 --> 22:03.176
So we'll get to learn
about it next week.

22:03.178 --> 22:03.878
Okay, thank you.

22:03.880 --> 22:06.679
Yeah of course, you did great.

22:06.681 --> 22:07.514
Thanks, bye.

22:07.516 --> 22:08.351
See you.

22:12.522 --> 22:14.554
Peer tutoring?

22:14.556 --> 22:15.622
Nerd.

22:15.624 --> 22:17.057
You just went to detention,
you're a delinquent.

22:17.059 --> 22:19.029
I'm just a product
of my environment.

22:19.896 --> 22:21.695
Well, you said it.

22:21.697 --> 22:22.866
I'm taking you out.

22:28.603 --> 22:29.869
You girls better hurry.

22:29.871 --> 22:32.872
I think Planned
Parenthood closes at six.

22:34.209 --> 22:35.443
You should really
get a punch card

22:35.445 --> 22:37.077
for your abortions, Cadence.

22:37.079 --> 22:38.579
You might get your
fifth one free.

22:38.581 --> 22:39.213
Oh.

22:40.550 --> 22:42.715
Ha, ha, ha, ha, good one.

22:42.717 --> 22:45.051
No really, you're funny,
what else do you got?

22:45.053 --> 22:45.919
Tell me more.

22:45.921 --> 22:48.054
Are you a fucking psycho?

22:48.056 --> 22:48.888
Get outta here.

22:48.890 --> 22:51.559
Uh, not as good.

22:51.561 --> 22:53.060
I guess you're not as
funny as I thought.

22:53.062 --> 22:55.564
Just leave you whore, God!

22:58.234 --> 22:59.466
You know, you should
really enjoy your

22:59.468 --> 23:02.570
last year here, Lila, 'cause
this bitchy cheerleader thing

23:02.572 --> 23:04.938
you got going on doesn't
work after high school.

23:04.940 --> 23:08.908
You fucking loser.

23:08.910 --> 23:11.645
Your life is already fucked.

23:11.647 --> 23:14.615
And everyone here
knows about you and

23:14.617 --> 23:17.618
that shit stays with
you, right girls?

23:17.620 --> 23:22.626
You might as well just like,
I don't know, kill yourself.

23:28.598 --> 23:29.929
Later, bitches!

23:29.931 --> 23:31.934
Is she serious?

23:33.268 --> 23:35.602
Due to the severe
weather we're experiencing,

23:35.604 --> 23:37.937
all school events will
have to be rescheduled.

23:37.939 --> 23:41.108
New times will be posted
first thing in the morning.

23:41.110 --> 23:42.746
Thank you.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.113

And there was, there
was a man coming.

25:02.891 --> 25:04.858
No, there was a.

25:04.860 --> 25:06.359
Oh, it's nothing.

25:06.361 --> 25:08.361
They just need to run a
few minutes of the film

25:08.363 --> 25:09.362
to calibrate the projectors.

25:09.364 --> 25:10.534
It wasn't a film.

25:11.434 --> 25:13.032
I think he's gonna
get really mad at us

25:13.034 --> 25:14.702
if we take any longer.

25:14.704 --> 25:17.607
Will you run back and I'll
come back as soon as I can?

25:18.774 --> 25:19.575
Are you sure you're okay?

25:21.043 --> 25:23.377
Yeah, um, yeah.

25:23.379 --> 25:24.744
It was just a film.

25:24.746 --> 25:26.714
I think I'm just tired.

25:26.716 --> 25:27.880
- Is not about...
- Ladies and gentlemen...

25:27.882 --> 25:29.716
No, it's not about anything.

25:29.718 --> 25:31.217
We will be
closing early tonight

25:31.219 --> 25:32.785
due to severe weather.

25:32.787 --> 25:34.221
Pick up your free
pass on the way out,

25:34.223 --> 25:36.560
drive safe, and
come back and see us.

26:28.444 --> 26:30.310
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come,

26:30.312 --> 26:31.145
through darkness.

27:16.324 --> 27:18.324
Cadence.

27:18.326 --> 27:20.159
Cadence, please turn that down.

27:20.161 --> 27:21.331
I'm exhausted.

28:33.435 --> 28:36.570
The tornado warning in
the Central Dallas Area

28:36.572 --> 28:39.907
in Southport remains in effect
until about 9:30 tonight.

28:39.909 --> 28:43.109
The major part of the
cell as you can see

28:43.111 --> 28:47.947
is centered along I-20, and
within this cell is a supercell,

28:47.949 --> 28:49.582
so with all the
moisture in the air

28:49.584 --> 28:52.452
and this cold front
pushing that air down

28:52.454 --> 28:55.455
slowly generating a
massive amount of energy.

28:55.457 --> 28:58.958
And the storm will continue to
build as the evening goes on,

28:58.960 --> 29:01.830
but right now there is
no confirmed tornado.

29:03.966 --> 29:05.599
Cadence?

29:05.601 --> 29:07.935
Hey, did you just call me
through a blocked number?

29:07.937 --> 29:10.603
No, why what's up?

29:10.605 --> 29:13.273
Nothing, I just got a
call from a blocked number

29:13.275 --> 29:14.608
and I thought it was you.

29:14.610 --> 29:16.944
Why would I block my number?

29:16.946 --> 29:18.445
I don't know.

29:18.447 --> 29:20.446
Is everything okay?

29:20.448 --> 29:22.482
Yeah I just, I figured you were

29:22.484 --> 29:25.284
freaking out because of
the storm or something.

29:25.286 --> 29:27.020
You kinda sound funny?

29:27.022 --> 29:27.955
Funny how?

29:27.957 --> 29:30.991
Funny like a clown?

29:30.993 --> 29:32.495
You are so odd.

29:33.461 --> 29:34.962
Later, hater.

29:34.964 --> 29:36.295
Hey.

29:36.297 --> 29:37.296
Yeah?

29:37.298 --> 29:38.467
You'd tell me if anything

29:39.634 --> 29:41.301
weird at all was
happening, right?

29:41.303 --> 29:43.139
Weird like curse weird?

29:44.473 --> 29:47.040
I can't believe your still
obsessed with that stupid game.

29:47.042 --> 29:48.140
Just promise, okay?

29:48.142 --> 29:50.313
Okay, I promise.

29:53.015 --> 29:54.313
Okay.

29:54.315 --> 29:55.150
Freak.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.987
The storm is
possible until it passes you by.

30:00.989 --> 30:04.157
Of course unless you have
a storm shelter to go into.

30:04.159 --> 30:05.993
So let's check in
now with Jeff Weiss

30:05.995 --> 30:07.030
in Storm Spotter One.

30:11.033 --> 30:12.131
Where do you think you're going?

30:12.133 --> 30:14.167
I just need to go to
Cadence's house for a minute.

30:14.169 --> 30:15.205
Are you kidding me?

30:17.072 --> 30:19.171
No, Ma'am, there's
a tornado watch.

30:19.173 --> 30:20.674
It's for a school project, Mom.

30:20.676 --> 30:22.912
No, absolutely not.

30:24.345 --> 30:25.147
Whatever.

30:30.351 --> 30:32.686
Weather changes
to watch across the country.

30:32.688 --> 30:35.054
Get your umbrellas and your
booties if you're going out.

30:51.105 --> 30:52.071
Oh, what the fuck?

30:57.646 --> 30:59.215
What the hell are you doing?

31:00.149 --> 31:01.351
I need you to play
the game with me.

31:01.717 --> 31:02.949
I know that's stupid and

31:02.951 --> 31:05.084
you think I'm crazy but I just
can't get it out of my head

31:05.086 --> 31:06.052
and I really don't
want you to die.

31:06.054 --> 31:07.053
I'm not gonna die.

31:07.055 --> 31:08.121
Okay, then just play with me.

31:08.123 --> 31:09.255
And then you don't have
to talk to me ever again.

31:09.257 --> 31:12.125
And I will figure out the
rest of the game by myself

31:12.127 --> 31:13.260
I just need you to
play it with me, okay?

31:13.262 --> 31:15.063
Okay, okay, I'll do it.

31:19.567 --> 31:21.234
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come,

31:21.236 --> 31:22.572
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

31:23.706 --> 31:25.738
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come,

31:25.740 --> 31:27.273
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

31:27.275 --> 31:28.574
From the fires of
Hell we dare you to...

31:32.113 --> 31:35.418
Okay, I will leave
you alone now.

31:36.986 --> 31:39.455
Wait, your Mom let you go
in the storm like this?

31:42.157 --> 31:43.426
I snuck out my window.

31:50.265 --> 31:52.435
Hey, what is that smell?

31:53.601 --> 31:54.434
What smell?

31:54.436 --> 31:55.605
It smells like gas.

31:56.772 --> 31:58.975
That's weird, I
don't smell anything.

32:01.610 --> 32:03.275
You seriously need
to quit smoking.

32:03.277 --> 32:04.980
Your sense of smell is whacked.

32:06.648 --> 32:08.117
Just don't light any matches.

32:09.284 --> 32:13.119
Hey, since you already
snuck out and everything

32:13.121 --> 32:14.620
do you wanna hang out for a bit?

32:14.622 --> 32:16.292
My Mom's not coming
home tonight.

32:18.627 --> 32:19.462
Okay.

32:34.208 --> 32:35.044
What?

32:37.146 --> 32:38.481
Can I ask you something?

32:39.648 --> 32:40.282
Yeah.

32:42.684 --> 32:44.320
What really happened in Maine?

32:46.487 --> 32:49.321
Just what I told you,
that my dad lost his job

32:49.323 --> 32:50.994
and then he got a new job here.

32:52.326 --> 32:53.659
You can't bullshit
a bullshitter.

32:53.661 --> 32:54.997
I know something happened.

32:57.666 --> 32:58.898
Look, I'm not gonna judge you.

32:58.900 --> 33:02.505
I'm sure whatever you did, I've
done a helluva lot worse so.

33:05.340 --> 33:06.175
There was...

33:08.677 --> 33:12.515
There was this guy, Cory,

33:14.216 --> 33:17.216
who was a junior
when I was a freshman

33:17.218 --> 33:20.689
in my old high school,
who I really liked.

33:22.224 --> 33:24.027
And he decided to
throw a party one night

33:25.526 --> 33:27.196
and all of my
friends and I went.

33:28.863 --> 33:32.067
And he gave me a lot of shots,

33:33.468 --> 33:35.534
which I wasn't really used to
'cause I don't really drink.

33:35.536 --> 33:38.540
And I just had one after the
other and got really drunk

33:40.242 --> 33:41.744
to the point of
almost passing out.

33:45.714 --> 33:50.250
And then I woke up in his
bedroom and all the lights

33:50.252 --> 33:52.252
were out and his hands
were all over me,

33:52.254 --> 33:54.223
and I kept telling him
to stop and he wouldn't.

33:58.392 --> 34:01.895
I told my Mom the next day
'cause I tell her everything,

34:01.897 --> 34:03.733
and I begged her
not to tell anyone.

34:05.133 --> 34:07.236
But she did, she tried
to press charges.

34:10.738 --> 34:12.608
And then everyone
at school found out.

34:14.910 --> 34:16.245
And they called me a liar,

34:18.747 --> 34:19.845
and just made my
life a living hell.

34:19.847 --> 34:22.414
It was really impossible
to be around them anymore

34:22.416 --> 34:24.252
so I just couldn't
go back to school

34:26.421 --> 34:27.921
What happened to him?

34:29.590 --> 34:32.591
Nothing, he went
to a Big 12 school

34:32.593 --> 34:34.764
and I think he got
a full scholarship.

34:36.597 --> 34:37.432
Wow.

34:39.468 --> 34:41.137
I mean, what's your story?

34:44.305 --> 34:45.441
I don't have a story.

34:47.441 --> 34:49.276
I'm perfect, I'm
actually thinking

34:49.278 --> 34:51.781
about running for
class president so.

35:04.293 --> 35:05.294
What is this?

35:13.501 --> 35:15.204
Oh my God, Cadence.

35:17.305 --> 35:18.140
Yeah, I.

35:19.307 --> 35:21.975
I got them to take
down a lot of the pages

35:21.977 --> 35:25.348
but they just keep
popping up more.

35:28.349 --> 35:29.649
Did you call the police?

35:29.651 --> 35:33.653
No, like you said,
you press charges

35:33.655 --> 35:35.821
and it just gets worse.

35:35.823 --> 35:38.193
I just kinda wanna
forget it ever happened.

35:40.662 --> 35:42.495
I'm really sorry.

35:42.497 --> 35:45.168
Fuck 'em, right?

35:46.334 --> 35:47.169
Yeah.

35:54.508 --> 35:57.376
Don't worry, I told you
they go off all the time.

35:57.378 --> 36:00.348
Just go before your
Mom freaks out.

36:02.517 --> 36:03.719
Go, good night!

36:34.416 --> 36:35.548
Pink.

36:35.550 --> 36:38.385
I thought black was the
official color of teen angst.

36:38.387 --> 36:39.419
What do you want?

36:39.421 --> 36:40.887
Okay.

36:40.889 --> 36:43.055
I'm not gonna be here when
you get home from school.

36:43.057 --> 36:45.425
Jack and I are going to
Austin for the weekend.

36:45.427 --> 36:46.392
What?

36:46.394 --> 36:48.061
I'll leave you money.

36:48.063 --> 36:50.729
You can call Aunt Kim
if something comes up.

36:50.731 --> 36:52.567
You really don't
remember, do you?

36:54.735 --> 36:57.570
My music showcase
is on Saturday.

36:57.572 --> 36:58.604
Oh honey, I'm sorry.

36:58.606 --> 36:59.909
I'll come to the next one.

37:00.909 --> 37:01.744
Whatever.

37:02.910 --> 37:04.412
You're my little snowflake.

37:06.414 --> 37:07.916
Hey, I love you.

37:16.425 --> 37:17.923
For the record,
you can't pull off

37:17.925 --> 37:19.794
the walk of shame
look anymore, okay?

37:38.947 --> 37:40.316
Babe, you were awesome.

37:46.454 --> 37:48.623
So there's a party
tomorrow night, you in?

37:51.626 --> 37:52.260
Right on.

37:55.130 --> 37:56.798
So I'll text you the address.

38:05.506 --> 38:06.472
What up, Rose?

38:06.474 --> 38:07.309
Hi.

38:11.146 --> 38:12.314
What was he doing here?

38:14.648 --> 38:17.649
Isn't he that cheerleader's
boyfriend or something?

38:17.651 --> 38:19.487
Boyfriend's a strong term.

38:23.992 --> 38:25.394
What are you doing here?

38:29.530 --> 38:31.997
Oh fuck.

38:31.999 --> 38:33.668
I know I'm being
really annoying.

38:35.537 --> 38:37.840
I just really need you to
figure this out with me.

38:39.006 --> 38:41.006
Fine, but if I
play you're coming

38:41.008 --> 38:42.677
to a party with me tomorrow.

38:44.678 --> 38:45.548
No, I'm not.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.548
Yeah, you are.

38:48.550 --> 38:49.883
No, I don't want to.

38:49.885 --> 38:51.854
Well, do you want me to
play the game or not?

39:02.030 --> 39:03.863
I will go to the party if
you just take it seriously

39:03.865 --> 39:06.698
so we can figure
it out together.

I don't really drink.

41:07.722 --> 41:08.490
Yeah, me either.

41:10.659 --> 41:12.825
You really don't look
like you're in college.

41:12.827 --> 41:13.662
No?

41:15.329 --> 41:15.963
Neither do you.

41:17.999 --> 41:19.535
I'm just here with my friend.

41:21.735 --> 41:22.570
Nice.

41:23.704 --> 41:24.539
I'm Justin.

41:25.706 --> 41:26.608
I'm Rose.

41:27.409 --> 41:29.175
Well, it is nice
to meet you, Rose.

41:29.177 --> 41:30.546
It's nice to meet you too.

41:32.847 --> 41:34.680
Do you wanna go
sit down somewhere?

41:34.682 --> 41:36.552
I'm not gonna have sex with you.

41:37.352 --> 41:38.484
Wow.

41:38.486 --> 41:43.191
Okay, well let me at least
not buy you dinner first.

41:44.726 --> 41:48.227
I'm sorry,
I sometimes just...

41:48.229 --> 41:51.567
You know, I was honestly just
thinking maybe the patio.

41:54.035 --> 41:55.367
After you?

42:24.765 --> 42:25.765
You okay?

42:25.767 --> 42:27.733
Hey, you all right?

42:27.735 --> 42:29.736
Okay well, now you gotta
tell me everything.

42:29.738 --> 42:33.106
And start from birth but
leave out all those messy bits

42:33.108 --> 42:35.577
like the placenta and the blood.

42:36.410 --> 42:37.579
Did you say placenta?

42:38.747 --> 42:42.247
Placenta is the worst opening
line in history I think.

42:42.249 --> 42:43.916
You know, now that I
actually say it out loud

42:43.918 --> 42:44.954
it sounds pretty bad.

42:45.919 --> 42:46.755
Placenta.

42:47.789 --> 42:49.254
- Placenta.
- Stop saying it then.

42:49.256 --> 42:50.789
- What, placenta?
- Yes.

42:52.260 --> 42:53.959
You wanna know what's crazy?

42:53.961 --> 42:56.095
I don't think that
I have ever actually

42:56.097 --> 42:58.296
said that word in
my entire life.

42:58.298 --> 42:59.601
You must inspire me, Rose.

43:00.267 --> 43:02.801
I don't know whether
I should be honored

43:02.803 --> 43:04.137
or just creeped out.

43:04.139 --> 43:06.439
Oh, definitely
creeped out, yeah.

43:06.441 --> 43:07.610
Okay.

43:47.816 --> 43:49.481
So it was really fucked up.

43:49.483 --> 43:50.816
So the girls lured her out there

43:50.818 --> 43:52.318
and then they tried to kill her.

43:52.320 --> 43:55.187
It's like some Dexter
level shit right there.

43:55.189 --> 43:56.856
I actually did hear about that.

43:56.858 --> 43:58.360
Something about
some internet game.

43:59.860 --> 44:01.494
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

44:01.496 --> 44:03.829
Yeah man, that's
creepy pasta, dude.

44:03.831 --> 44:05.198
They blamed it on Slender Man.

44:05.200 --> 44:08.166
They said that he
told them to do it.

44:08.168 --> 44:09.269
What if he really did do it?

44:12.006 --> 44:14.710
Are you saying you think
that the Slender Man is real?

44:16.043 --> 44:18.176
It's just the
whole thing is that

44:18.178 --> 44:21.015
you look at a photo of him
and then you go crazy, right?

44:22.050 --> 44:24.182
You do know that it's
all a joke, right?

44:24.184 --> 44:24.883
Please tell me you know that.

44:24.885 --> 44:26.753
No, but that's what happened.

44:26.755 --> 44:29.021
They looked at the photo
and then they went crazy.

44:29.023 --> 44:30.758
So doesn't that mean it's real?

44:31.526 --> 44:33.024
I know a creepy pasta game.

44:33.026 --> 44:35.193
What game is that?

44:35.195 --> 44:36.030
47.

44:37.197 --> 44:39.030
Cadence, no.

44:39.032 --> 44:39.999
What are you doing?

44:40.001 --> 44:41.934
I mean, unless you're
too scared to play,

44:41.936 --> 44:42.767
- we don't have to.
- No, uh.

44:42.769 --> 44:44.202
Yeah no, I'm
definitely not scared.

44:44.204 --> 44:46.204
Okay, then play with me.

44:46.206 --> 44:47.875
Okay, bring it on.

44:51.847 --> 44:53.546
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come,

44:53.548 --> 44:56.381
through darkness and blood
if you're real pick one.

44:56.383 --> 44:57.550
Please don't do it.

44:57.552 --> 44:59.218
- It's just a silly game.
- Better hurry.

44:59.220 --> 45:00.919
Okay, through the.

45:00.921 --> 45:01.921
- From the fires of Hell...
- From the fires of Hell.

45:01.923 --> 45:03.789
- We dare you to come...
- We dare you to come.

45:03.791 --> 45:05.224
- Through darkness and blood...
- Through darkness and blood.

45:05.226 --> 45:07.396
- If you're real pick one.
- If you're real pick one.

45:10.398 --> 45:12.298
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come

45:12.300 --> 45:14.269
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

45:16.503 --> 45:18.239
Through the...

45:19.573 --> 45:20.573
That was not cool.

45:20.575 --> 45:21.573
Hey, don't worry about it.

45:21.575 --> 45:22.844
It's just some stupid game.

45:23.410 --> 45:24.912
It's bullshit.

45:25.979 --> 45:27.579
Oh, I'm sorry.

45:27.581 --> 45:30.983
I hate to interrupt this
little teen skank drama fest,

45:30.985 --> 45:32.952
but I played that generic game

45:32.954 --> 45:36.325
and as you can see I am
fucking thriving.

45:37.925 --> 45:38.826
Wait, you played the game?

45:39.961 --> 45:41.930
Yeah, don't be so fucking basic.

45:42.597 --> 45:43.799
When, when did you play it?

45:44.698 --> 45:47.432
Wednesday after the
wrestling matches.

45:47.434 --> 45:50.468
At the after party, we actually
played a lot of games there.

45:50.470 --> 45:51.840
Wrestlers are a lot of fun.

45:53.006 --> 45:56.608
Well, if it isn't Lila
Larson, head cheer-cunt

45:56.610 --> 45:59.178
or is it cunt-leader,
I can't remember?

45:59.180 --> 46:00.146
Ooh.

46:00.148 --> 46:02.615
Wow Liam, this is a
new low, even for you.

46:02.617 --> 46:06.151
Well, remember, you were the
one that broke up with me so...

46:06.153 --> 46:08.620
You know, I'm sure
somehow in that little

46:08.622 --> 46:11.122
twisted mind of yours
you think that having sex

46:11.124 --> 46:13.459
with my ex makes
you as good as me,

46:13.461 --> 46:16.629
that it somehow validates you,

46:16.631 --> 46:20.966
but he told all his friends
that he's only fucking you

46:20.968 --> 46:24.135
because you do ass
to mouth.

46:29.010 --> 46:29.776
Oh my God!

46:29.778 --> 46:33.044
- You are disgusting!
- Cadence!

46:33.046 --> 46:33.945
Fuck!

46:33.947 --> 46:36.481
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

46:36.483 --> 46:37.985
Here, come on, we have
to get her out of here.

46:39.486 --> 46:40.488
Almost there.

46:42.155 --> 46:44.490
No, no, I don't wanna go home.

46:44.492 --> 46:45.658
- No, no.
- Come on.

46:45.660 --> 46:46.658
Be careful, be careful.

46:46.660 --> 46:48.363
Watch your head,
watch your head.

46:50.164 --> 46:51.499
Okay, I'm taking us home.

46:55.903 --> 46:56.903
Do you want me to follow you?

46:56.905 --> 46:57.669
Are you gonna be okay?

46:57.671 --> 46:59.204
No I'm gonna be good, thank you.

46:59.206 --> 47:00.208
All right.

47:01.376 --> 47:03.675
Hey, I'm really sorry that
my sister was such a bitch.

47:03.677 --> 47:05.678
It was like growing
up with this little

47:05.680 --> 47:09.180
evil blond sociopath.

47:09.182 --> 47:10.515
That's probably why
I'm a psych major.

47:10.517 --> 47:14.519
Yeah, I just, I didn't
know you had a sister.

47:14.521 --> 47:17.222
Yeah, Lila.

47:17.224 --> 47:19.358
Lila Larson is your sister?

47:19.360 --> 47:21.059
I'm afraid so.

47:21.061 --> 47:21.693
Wow.

47:23.363 --> 47:25.196
Ah shit, dude!

47:25.198 --> 47:28.033
Hey, I'm on probation,
all right so we gotta go.

47:28.035 --> 47:29.200
- All right.
- Come on.

47:29.202 --> 47:30.236
- Okay.
- Yeah, you should get going.

47:30.238 --> 47:31.370
Yeah, you should get going.

47:31.372 --> 47:32.437
Okay.

47:32.439 --> 47:33.939
- We'll see you later?
- Yeah, I'll see you soon.

47:33.941 --> 47:35.543
- Okay. Bye!
- Okay.

47:41.081 --> 47:43.082
Buenos Dias, Cadence!

47:43.084 --> 47:45.117
<i>Dormiste bien?</i>

47:53.093 --> 47:54.392
I got you orange juice.

47:54.394 --> 47:56.095
Why are you speaking Spanish?

47:56.097 --> 47:58.233
Because we have a Spanish
test to study for.

47:59.233 --> 48:00.432
Why are you in such a good mood?

48:00.434 --> 48:02.236
Because it's a
beautiful day out.

48:04.405 --> 48:05.941
What happened last night?

48:06.740 --> 48:07.943
You don't remember?

48:09.144 --> 48:12.080
The last thing I remember is
dancing in the living room.

48:13.414 --> 48:16.082
Okay, well, a lot more
than that happened.

48:16.084 --> 48:16.952
Like what?

48:18.285 --> 48:20.586
Actually, just
don't tell me okay?

48:20.588 --> 48:22.088
I don't want to know.

48:22.090 --> 48:24.122
Are you sure you don't
want me to tell you?

48:24.124 --> 48:27.425
No, I woke up in my own
bed with my clothes on

48:27.427 --> 48:29.428
with no tattoos or
visible injuries.

48:29.430 --> 48:30.432
I'd say I'm good.

48:32.133 --> 48:36.135
Okay well, long story short
is that Lila Larson is alive,

48:36.137 --> 48:38.269
which means that the
game is bullshit.

48:38.271 --> 48:39.771
Lila Larson, the cheer-cunt.

48:39.773 --> 48:42.608
The cunt-leader, yeah, you
made the same joke last night.

48:42.610 --> 48:44.609
Wait, she was at the party?

48:44.611 --> 48:46.144
Yeah.

48:46.146 --> 48:48.146
Did she see me with Liam?

48:48.148 --> 48:48.983
Yeah.

48:50.151 --> 48:50.953
And?

48:51.785 --> 48:53.454
And it was a little bit awkward.

48:54.622 --> 48:56.454
Oh, fuck.

48:56.456 --> 48:58.289
Okay, well don't tell
me anything else.

48:58.291 --> 48:59.124
No you need to know this.

48:59.126 --> 49:00.626
Lila Larson is alive.

49:00.628 --> 49:03.294
She played the game Wednesday
after the wrestling match

49:03.296 --> 49:04.796
and she was at the
party Saturday night,

49:04.798 --> 49:07.298
which means that two days
went by, more than two days.

49:07.300 --> 49:08.300
So the game is bullshit.

49:08.302 --> 49:10.301
Yay!

49:10.303 --> 49:13.008
I kinda wish it was real
just so we could see her die.

49:14.474 --> 49:16.675
Well, she didn't die but
you puked all over her.

49:16.677 --> 49:18.309
Okay, you can go now.

49:18.311 --> 49:20.314
It was green
and nasty and gross.

49:50.677 --> 49:52.343
Hey.

49:52.345 --> 49:53.044
What's happening?

49:53.046 --> 49:54.713
Did somebody die or something?

49:54.715 --> 49:57.082
Students, I think most of
you have heard the news

49:57.084 --> 49:59.350
by now that a student at
Lincoln Heights High School

49:59.352 --> 50:00.521
has passed away.

50:01.722 --> 50:05.191
Lila Larson was loved
for her school spirit

50:05.193 --> 50:07.693
and vibrant personality.

50:07.695 --> 50:09.528
She was an excellent
cheerleader.

50:09.530 --> 50:12.865
Her vivacious personality
will be missed in this class.

50:12.867 --> 50:15.367
She was also an
excellent student.

50:15.369 --> 50:19.204
Memorial services will be
held soon, so stay tuned.

50:19.206 --> 50:21.709
We'll let you know as soon
as we have information.

50:25.113 --> 50:26.548
She didn't even know Lila!

50:32.220 --> 50:34.222
Hey, what's the matter?

50:36.389 --> 50:37.558
She got the day wrong.

50:38.726 --> 50:39.727
What?

50:41.729 --> 50:42.764
Lila's dead.

50:46.233 --> 50:48.069
Wait, are you serious?

50:49.236 --> 50:50.568
She said she played
the game on Wednesday

50:50.570 --> 50:52.403
after the wrestling
match 'cause that's

50:52.405 --> 50:54.740
when wrestling
matches usually are.

50:54.742 --> 50:57.245
This week it was on Thursday
because of the storm.

50:58.912 --> 51:00.282
She didn't make it two days.

51:02.282 --> 51:04.785
No, that's just a
coincidence, okay?

51:05.919 --> 51:10.258
A freakish and sad coincidence.

51:11.425 --> 51:12.760
She's dead, Cadence.

51:14.294 --> 51:17.463
She played the
game and she died.

51:17.465 --> 51:20.168
Well, that's not possible
because it's not real.

51:21.434 --> 51:23.604
I don't know, I mean what if...

51:25.773 --> 51:26.775
What if it is real?

51:30.610 --> 51:31.779
I don't wanna die.

51:32.646 --> 51:33.782
I know.

51:35.483 --> 51:36.782
Well, let's think.

51:36.784 --> 51:39.621
I mean, the game's on me, right?

51:43.356 --> 51:44.291
No, it's on Justin.

51:46.293 --> 51:47.294
Wait.

51:49.796 --> 51:52.300
Fuck.

51:56.836 --> 51:58.172
Fuck.

51:59.307 --> 52:01.640
I mean, why the fuck would
I play the game with him?

52:01.642 --> 52:04.309
Jack Daniels made
you do it I guess?

52:04.311 --> 52:06.514
So what, they found
her car in the creek?

52:07.981 --> 52:10.316
No, they found it next to
creek and she was drowned

52:10.318 --> 52:12.486
in the creek like the
car had crashed and

52:13.854 --> 52:16.321
she was running
away from something.

52:16.323 --> 52:18.323
You don't think she
just had too much

52:18.325 --> 52:20.658
to drink at the
party or something?

52:20.660 --> 52:23.361
No, I don't think everyone
gets as drunk as you do.

52:23.363 --> 52:24.262
Right, because it
makes a lot more sense

52:24.264 --> 52:27.233
that a fucking iPhone
game killed her.

52:27.235 --> 52:29.001
God, it's so dumb.

52:29.003 --> 52:31.003
No, what's dumb is
living in denial.

52:31.005 --> 52:33.372
This is real, it's happening.

52:33.374 --> 52:35.006
I know you don't like
talking about real shit...

52:35.008 --> 52:36.177
Excuse me?

52:39.012 --> 52:40.512
You can't just run
away from this one.

52:40.514 --> 52:42.013
You can't just deactivate
your Facebook page

52:42.015 --> 52:43.515
and hope for the best.

52:43.517 --> 52:45.017
Me, runaway?

52:45.019 --> 52:47.255
Okay Bang-her, Maine, fuck you!

53:00.034 --> 53:01.033
If you really don't
care then that's fine.

53:01.035 --> 53:04.706
I'll just figure it out
all by myself, I guess.

54:03.097 --> 54:03.961
- Rose.
- Hi.

54:03.963 --> 54:05.097
Hi.

54:05.099 --> 54:06.631
I'm so sorry for your loss.

54:06.633 --> 54:08.100
Thank you.

54:08.102 --> 54:08.937
Yeah.

54:09.938 --> 54:12.470
I don't know, it's just
really, it's surreal.

54:12.472 --> 54:14.640
I know this might not be
the appropriate thing to say

54:14.642 --> 54:17.343
but I'm just really
happy to be seeing you.

54:17.345 --> 54:18.943
Do you wanna go outside?

54:18.945 --> 54:20.447
Yeah, that'd be really nice.

54:21.481 --> 54:22.316
Come on.

54:29.622 --> 54:34.359
I know you think that she was
probably just some evil bitch.

54:34.361 --> 54:35.126
No, I don't.

54:35.128 --> 54:36.331
No, she was.

54:40.133 --> 54:41.802
But that wasn't really her.

54:43.137 --> 54:45.307
I don't know, I think
that she was just so,

54:46.474 --> 54:49.811
she was so desperate to
be popular, you know?

54:50.811 --> 54:51.778
It changed her.

54:55.849 --> 54:57.985
I'm really glad that
you came here today.

54:59.519 --> 55:00.619
To be honest with ya,

55:00.621 --> 55:02.657
I wasn't sure that I was
ever gonna see you again.

55:05.659 --> 55:07.361
I need to ask you something.

55:08.496 --> 55:09.997
Yeah, of course, what is it?

55:12.532 --> 55:14.001
We need to play that phone game.

55:15.168 --> 55:17.001
The one that we played
on Saturday night.

55:17.003 --> 55:17.838
What?

55:19.539 --> 55:21.173
Are you serious, now?

55:21.175 --> 55:22.673
Yeah, it's really important.

55:22.675 --> 55:23.374
But why?

55:23.376 --> 55:24.843
I know that this sounds crazy.

55:24.845 --> 55:26.514
I just need you
to trust me, okay?

55:28.182 --> 55:29.351
That game is real.

55:30.517 --> 55:32.019
It's what killed your sister.

55:36.189 --> 55:38.023
That is not fucking funny.

55:38.025 --> 55:39.191
I'm not trying to be funny.

55:39.193 --> 55:41.028
I just need you to believe me.

55:43.063 --> 55:44.032
It's real.

55:45.532 --> 55:48.033
It killed your sister and

55:48.035 --> 55:50.538
if you don't play it again
it's gonna kill you too.

55:54.041 --> 55:55.744
Please, Justin.

56:05.052 --> 56:06.885
What the hell is
wrong with you, freak?

56:06.887 --> 56:08.220
Just get out of my way.

56:08.222 --> 56:10.425
I really think that
you should leave.

56:12.726 --> 56:13.561
All right.

56:32.947 --> 56:34.745
You need to come
with me right now.

56:34.747 --> 56:35.914
What?

56:35.916 --> 56:37.749
I need you to play 47 hours now.

56:37.751 --> 56:40.486
Okay look, I don't know
what is wrong with you two

56:40.488 --> 56:41.553
all right, but
whatever sick obsession

56:41.555 --> 56:43.254
- you have with this game...
- If you don't play the

56:43.256 --> 56:45.624
game you're gonna fucking
die, so just do it.

56:46.927 --> 56:48.926
Look, I'm sorry
about your sister.

56:48.928 --> 56:50.762
I really am, okay?

56:50.764 --> 56:52.930
But I don't have the
time to explain to you

56:52.932 --> 56:53.932
what's going on here so unless

56:53.934 --> 56:55.767
you want me to make a
scene in front of your

56:55.769 --> 56:58.439
entire fucking family,
then you'll just do it.

57:01.642 --> 57:02.444
Take the phone.

57:09.282 --> 57:10.951
There you go, game's on me now.

58:01.168 --> 58:02.503
I can't breathe.

58:04.738 --> 58:06.674
I can't breathe, help me!

58:08.675 --> 58:10.711
Help me, I can't breathe!

58:11.678 --> 58:12.680
I'm rotting!

59:08.267 --> 59:11.068
Cadence, honey, come here.

59:11.070 --> 59:13.771
Are you okay, are you okay?

59:13.773 --> 59:14.740
What happened?

59:14.742 --> 59:15.740
Here.

59:15.742 --> 59:17.075
Okay, you're fine, you're fine.

59:17.077 --> 59:19.811
Just night terrors?

59:19.813 --> 59:20.912
What?

59:27.755 --> 59:29.289
Honey, you cracked your screen.

59:30.657 --> 59:31.291
Yeah.

59:33.793 --> 59:34.595
That's really scary.

59:35.597 --> 59:37.762
I think we should start
alternating every night.

59:37.764 --> 59:39.296
I don't wanna take any chances.

59:39.298 --> 59:40.798
I don't care what we do.

59:40.800 --> 59:42.033
We just need to
figure this shit out

59:42.035 --> 59:44.606
'cause I'm not playing this for
the rest of my fucking life.

59:45.972 --> 59:48.939
So then meet me at the
library during lunch.

59:48.941 --> 59:49.776
Okay.

59:57.818 --> 59:59.653
Who the fuck wrote this thing?

1:00:01.854 --> 1:00:02.720
It looks like whoever wrote it

1:00:02.722 --> 1:00:04.659
didn't want us to
know who they are.

1:00:05.325 --> 1:00:06.794
Yeah, well that's too bad.

1:00:09.329 --> 1:00:10.164
Fuck me.

What?

1:01:05.918 --> 1:01:08.887
The horror site, Spider's Web.

1:01:08.889 --> 1:01:10.724
We're looking for
Raven Lockness.

1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:14.059
Raven Lockness!

1:01:14.061 --> 1:01:17.731
Jesus Fucking
Christ, I have a fan.

1:01:18.898 --> 1:01:21.533
Do you run the horror
site the Spider's Web?

1:01:21.535 --> 1:01:23.371
Just until I sell
my first novel.

1:01:24.537 --> 1:01:27.773
Full scholarship to
college, English degree,

1:01:27.775 --> 1:01:30.878
summa cum laude,
and look at me now.

1:01:32.044 --> 1:01:34.879
Stay in high school
forever, girls.

1:01:34.881 --> 1:01:37.916
The real world is a
goddamn horror show.

1:01:37.918 --> 1:01:40.220
Can you please sit down
and just talk to us?

1:01:43.557 --> 1:01:45.890
So where do you get the
stories that are on your site?

1:01:45.892 --> 1:01:47.925
Are you the one who writes them?

1:01:47.927 --> 1:01:49.227
I write some of them.

1:01:49.229 --> 1:01:50.732
What about "47 Hours"?

1:01:52.398 --> 1:01:53.433
The summoning game?

1:01:54.802 --> 1:01:55.769
I didn't write that one.

1:01:56.936 --> 1:01:57.936
That's not on my site anymore.

1:01:57.938 --> 1:01:59.773
Yes it is, we just played it.

1:02:01.575 --> 1:02:02.744
So you know about it?

1:02:06.079 --> 1:02:07.979
We think that that
game cursed us somehow.

1:02:07.981 --> 1:02:09.580
Probably think we're nuts.

1:02:09.582 --> 1:02:11.418
No, the mind is
a powerful thing.

1:02:12.919 --> 1:02:15.756
If you believe it,
then it's real.

1:02:19.126 --> 1:02:21.926
Anonymous, no author.

1:02:21.928 --> 1:02:23.928
No that's not possible,
someone must have written it

1:02:23.930 --> 1:02:25.963
so can you just look
up who submitted it?

1:02:25.965 --> 1:02:27.097
Well, a lot of
the stories online

1:02:27.099 --> 1:02:28.966
are written by lots of people.

1:02:28.968 --> 1:02:31.602
They're written and
rewritten and shared

1:02:31.604 --> 1:02:34.307
and collected and added to.

1:02:35.474 --> 1:02:37.441
They're basically
like urban legends.

1:02:37.443 --> 1:02:38.276
They come from sort of

1:02:38.278 --> 1:02:40.445
a collective
consciousness, I guess.

1:02:40.447 --> 1:02:41.946
Okay, so what are you saying?

1:02:41.948 --> 1:02:43.950
I can't tell you who
actually wrote it.

1:02:45.952 --> 1:02:47.954
I can tell you who
posted it though.

1:02:59.298 --> 1:03:00.333
Great, thanks.

1:03:04.003 --> 1:03:05.472
You need to take that game down.

1:03:07.474 --> 1:03:08.976
Thanks so much for your help.

1:03:15.648 --> 1:03:16.851
Who are you texting?

1:03:17.918 --> 1:03:19.984
Liam, his roommate's a
full-blown computer hacker.

1:03:19.986 --> 1:03:22.322
That's how he gets all
his bootleg video games.

1:03:27.994 --> 1:03:30.160
When are we gonna
get together again?

1:03:30.162 --> 1:03:30.861
Come on, you know.

1:03:30.863 --> 1:03:34.999
For a little one on one time.

1:03:35.001 --> 1:03:38.035
Well never, if you keep
saying it like that.

1:03:38.037 --> 1:03:39.873
Why do you have
so many computers?

1:03:41.041 --> 1:03:43.073
The bottom six are mining
bitcoin and the top three

1:03:43.075 --> 1:03:44.845
are running different
bots on Warcraft.

1:03:46.178 --> 1:03:47.512
Huh.

1:03:47.514 --> 1:03:49.349
Yeah, that seems about right.

1:03:51.017 --> 1:03:53.017
So why exactly do you
want this address?

1:03:53.019 --> 1:03:54.021
It seems weird.

1:03:56.023 --> 1:03:58.025
If I told you, you
wouldn't believe me.

1:03:59.392 --> 1:04:01.026
Well, here you go.

1:04:01.028 --> 1:04:06.033
6661FM 991 Red Water, Texas.

1:04:07.367 --> 1:04:09.871
East Texas, north of
Longview, near Texarkana.

1:04:11.537 --> 1:04:12.537
Yeah.

1:04:12.539 --> 1:04:13.407
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

1:04:15.207 --> 1:04:16.043
Be careful.

1:04:17.010 --> 1:04:20.211
In my experience, people
who post anonymously

1:04:20.213 --> 1:04:21.916
do it for a reason.

1:04:49.742 --> 1:04:51.242
Wait, Cadence.

1:04:51.244 --> 1:04:52.577
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

1:04:52.579 --> 1:04:54.115
It's a fucking horrible idea.

1:05:10.764 --> 1:05:12.262
What do you want?

1:05:12.264 --> 1:05:14.265
Sorry to bother you.

1:05:14.267 --> 1:05:16.767
Not very sorry, it seems.

1:05:16.769 --> 1:05:19.104
We're just looking for
the author of this story.

1:05:19.106 --> 1:05:20.604
It's called 47 hours.

1:05:20.606 --> 1:05:24.608
Well, I never read no books
so you're in the wrong place.

1:05:24.610 --> 1:05:27.278
It's not a book, it's just
a story on some website.

1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:28.312
It's called the Spider's Web.

1:05:28.314 --> 1:05:30.115
I never heard of it,

1:05:30.117 --> 1:05:33.785
and I definitely did
not put anything on it.

1:05:33.787 --> 1:05:35.990
Well, does anyone
else live with you or?

1:05:38.124 --> 1:05:38.959
Like I said.

1:05:40.459 --> 1:05:43.794
I don't know nothin' about
no stories on a website.

1:05:58.144 --> 1:05:59.313
Psst, over here.

1:06:03.316 --> 1:06:04.816
You read the story?

1:06:04.818 --> 1:06:07.684
Course they read the story,
why else would they be here?

1:06:07.686 --> 1:06:10.155
But did they read the story?

1:06:10.157 --> 1:06:13.658
They have the look,
definitely read it.

1:06:13.660 --> 1:06:14.662
Did you read it?

1:06:16.329 --> 1:06:18.495
Yeah, yeah, we read it.

1:06:18.497 --> 1:06:21.166
How long, how long
have you been playing?

1:06:21.168 --> 1:06:22.169
Tell me, how long?

1:06:23.503 --> 1:06:24.669
About a week.

1:06:26.206 --> 1:06:28.175
Just a week, that's all.

1:06:29.342 --> 1:06:31.175
Ask us how long
we've been playing.

1:06:31.177 --> 1:06:32.843
Ask us.

1:06:32.845 --> 1:06:34.845
Five years.

1:06:34.847 --> 1:06:37.682
We've been playing
the game five years.

1:06:37.684 --> 1:06:39.053
Did you write it?

1:06:39.852 --> 1:06:41.519
We.

1:06:41.521 --> 1:06:43.354
We posted it but
we didn't write it.

1:06:43.356 --> 1:06:44.689
Where did
you get it from?

1:06:44.691 --> 1:06:47.225
From the web, where else?

1:06:47.227 --> 1:06:49.193
So who wrote it first?

1:06:49.195 --> 1:06:51.064
- Him, I suppose.
- Shh!

1:06:52.231 --> 1:06:53.530
Who is he?

1:06:53.532 --> 1:06:56.569
Don't be silly,
you know who he is.

1:06:58.271 --> 1:07:00.537
That's right, or you
wouldn't be here.

1:07:00.539 --> 1:07:02.575
The more you play, the
more you'll see him.

1:07:04.211 --> 1:07:05.209
Well, I don't get it?

1:07:05.211 --> 1:07:06.878
Why would you post it if
you knew the bad things

1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:07.879
that would happen
to other people?

1:07:07.881 --> 1:07:12.720
Because if you die maybe
he'll leave us alone.

1:07:17.224 --> 1:07:18.722
What the hell are
you doing here?

1:07:44.316 --> 1:07:45.119
You okay?

1:07:47.586 --> 1:07:48.588
Yeah, I...

1:07:49.923 --> 1:07:52.256
I just thought we'd
get some answers today.

1:07:52.258 --> 1:07:55.292
I know, we're gonna
figure it out though.

1:07:55.294 --> 1:07:56.794
And fuck him, whoever he is.

1:07:56.796 --> 1:07:57.798
We're not gonna die.

1:08:00.432 --> 1:08:03.600
I don't wanna end up
like those girls either.

1:08:03.602 --> 1:08:05.303
Yeah well, I'm pretty
sure those inbred bitches

1:08:05.305 --> 1:08:07.274
were freaks way
before this started.

1:08:13.445 --> 1:08:14.614
It's time to switch.

1:09:37.363 --> 1:09:38.198
Rose!

1:09:39.398 --> 1:09:41.365
Hey, you okay?

1:09:41.367 --> 1:09:43.704
I mean, other than that
huge zit on your cheek?

1:09:45.037 --> 1:09:48.373
Oh relax, it's a tiny zit,
it's the least of our worries.

1:09:48.375 --> 1:09:50.544
Actually, I think I
found a solution, look.

1:09:54.046 --> 1:09:54.881
Death row.

1:09:56.049 --> 1:09:56.917
What do you mean?

1:09:58.018 --> 1:09:59.217
All we have to do is play
with a death row inmate.

1:09:59.219 --> 1:10:01.418
I mean, we'd have to do it
through the glass or some shit

1:10:01.420 --> 1:10:02.386
but I think it would work.

1:10:02.388 --> 1:10:03.721
Are you being serious?

1:10:03.723 --> 1:10:05.422
Yeah, I mean, they're
gonna die anyways.

1:10:05.424 --> 1:10:06.427
It's a win-win situation.

1:10:08.561 --> 1:10:09.195
What?

1:10:10.397 --> 1:10:12.265
I don't know if I can do that.

1:10:13.566 --> 1:10:14.568
Wait, why?

1:10:15.835 --> 1:10:18.435
[Announcer <i>Paradise awaits
you at the incomparable</i>

1:10:18.437 --> 1:10:21.739
<i>Wakuini Kanuki Resort on the
beautiful island of Lanai.</i>

1:10:21.741 --> 1:10:23.074
You off today?

1:10:23.076 --> 1:10:25.075
I have a surprise.

1:10:25.077 --> 1:10:25.946
For me?

1:10:26.745 --> 1:10:29.413
Well, for us.

1:10:29.415 --> 1:10:30.948
We're going on vacation?

1:10:30.950 --> 1:10:32.617
Well, I am.

1:10:32.619 --> 1:10:34.255
We are, Jack and I.

1:10:35.421 --> 1:10:36.753
Honeymoon!

1:10:36.755 --> 1:10:37.590
Right.

1:10:38.558 --> 1:10:40.958
Okay, so what does this
have to do with me?

1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:43.593
Well, we're all
moving to Austin.

1:10:43.595 --> 1:10:45.596
Jack has family there
and his grandmother isn't

1:10:45.598 --> 1:10:47.935
doing well so he wants
to be close to her.

1:10:49.602 --> 1:10:52.636
She's rich, about to die, right?

1:10:52.638 --> 1:10:53.940
How noble of him.

1:10:54.941 --> 1:10:57.441
Noble and financially
beneficial.

1:10:57.443 --> 1:10:59.444
Can't you just be
happy for me, Cadence?

1:10:59.446 --> 1:11:00.778
It's not always about you.

1:11:00.780 --> 1:11:03.480
He's the best thing that
ever happened to me.

1:11:03.482 --> 1:11:04.481
Really?

1:11:04.483 --> 1:11:06.820
Don't you feel sorry for
yourself, what about me?

1:11:07.987 --> 1:11:10.488
I gave and I gave and
I gave to your father

1:11:10.490 --> 1:11:12.457
and he left you to
raise me all on my own.

1:11:12.459 --> 1:11:13.958
Oh well, I'm sorry you were

1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:17.627
- subjected to raise me.
- No, I loved raising you.

1:11:17.629 --> 1:11:18.962
But now I need to
do something for me.

1:11:18.964 --> 1:11:21.632
I mean, don't I deserve that?

1:11:21.634 --> 1:11:25.472
Jack makes me feel
good, I'm finally happy.

1:11:27.506 --> 1:11:29.806
Well, I'm not
moving to Austin so.

1:11:29.808 --> 1:11:31.476
I understand, you wanna finish

1:11:31.478 --> 1:11:33.543
out high school
with your friends.

1:11:33.545 --> 1:11:35.480
You can move in with your dad.

1:11:35.482 --> 1:11:36.116
Fuck that!

1:11:38.151 --> 1:11:39.820
Sweetie, we'll figure it out!

1:11:42.655 --> 1:11:44.654
Oh, I'm staying over
at Jack's tonight.

1:11:44.656 --> 1:11:45.825
You're on your own for dinner.

1:11:51.497 --> 1:11:52.332
Cadence?

1:11:56.402 --> 1:11:57.370
Hello?

1:12:19.526 --> 1:12:20.361
Hello?

1:12:26.698 --> 1:12:28.434
Holy shit, Rose.

1:12:29.536 --> 1:12:31.038
I thought you were her mother.

1:12:33.205 --> 1:12:34.872
What time is it?

1:12:34.874 --> 1:12:36.207
Is her Mom downstairs?

1:12:36.209 --> 1:12:37.044
No.

1:12:38.611 --> 1:12:39.446
Good.

1:12:52.224 --> 1:12:54.394
So I guess you're
gonna judge me now too.

1:12:55.228 --> 1:12:57.895
Go ahead, it's true.

1:12:57.897 --> 1:12:59.400
I'm a horrible person.

1:13:01.768 --> 1:13:02.736
No you're not.

1:13:05.237 --> 1:13:06.736
What happened?

1:13:06.738 --> 1:13:09.108
What didn't happen,
life fucking happened.

1:13:10.576 --> 1:13:12.610
We can't all be
perfect like you.

1:13:15.581 --> 1:13:16.916
Just go, okay.

1:13:19.652 --> 1:13:20.918
We have to play.

1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:23.753
Oh my God, enough
with the fucking game.

1:13:23.755 --> 1:13:25.925
I'm done, I'm not
doing it anymore.

1:13:27.259 --> 1:13:29.260
I'm sorry but we
really have to play.

1:13:29.262 --> 1:13:30.761
What, are we just
gonna play everyday

1:13:30.763 --> 1:13:32.599
for the rest of our lives?

1:13:33.633 --> 1:13:35.600
Thanks, but no thanks.

1:13:35.602 --> 1:13:37.601
I'll just let it kill me, okay.

1:13:37.603 --> 1:13:39.270
It'll be doing me a
favor at this point.

1:13:45.678 --> 1:13:48.613
Oh, that's right, it's on you.

1:13:48.615 --> 1:13:49.650
Well, let's fix that.

1:13:55.655 --> 1:13:57.288
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come

1:13:57.290 --> 1:13:59.957
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

1:13:59.959 --> 1:14:01.659
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come

1:14:01.661 --> 1:14:03.630
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

1:14:04.630 --> 1:14:05.629
From the fires of Hell we...

1:14:08.134 --> 1:14:09.300
There, it's done.

1:14:09.302 --> 1:14:12.505
Just go, okay, I need to sleep.

1:14:15.974 --> 1:14:17.641
The experiment with
baby monkeys showed

1:14:17.643 --> 1:14:19.644
that the monkeys who were
denied physical contact

1:14:19.646 --> 1:14:21.979
were more likely to
exhibit aberrant behaviors

1:14:21.981 --> 1:14:25.650
such as self mutilation,
autistic rocking...

1:14:27.152 --> 1:14:29.686
Dr. Harlow's critics believed
that these experiments

1:14:29.688 --> 1:14:31.821
actually did not transfer
to human subjects.

1:14:31.823 --> 1:14:35.159
They believed that
nursing was as important.

1:14:35.161 --> 1:14:36.497
Hey, you okay?

1:14:37.996 --> 1:14:39.163
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:14:39.165 --> 1:14:40.698
I wouldn't talk to
her if I were you.

1:14:40.700 --> 1:14:42.166
She might put a curse on you.

1:14:42.168 --> 1:14:45.002
Everybody knows about that
weirdo witchcraft shit

1:14:45.004 --> 1:14:45.970
you put on Justin.

1:14:45.972 --> 1:14:47.872
She wanted him to drink
her menstrual blood.

1:14:47.874 --> 1:14:50.041
All right, ladies, break it up.

1:14:50.043 --> 1:14:52.045
Do I need to take that?

1:14:53.012 --> 1:14:54.548
No, you don't have to take it.

1:14:56.715 --> 1:14:58.349
Your assignment is
to write an essay

1:14:58.351 --> 1:15:00.016
on the importance
of physical contact

1:15:00.018 --> 1:15:03.721
and what the emotional
and physical effects

1:15:03.723 --> 1:15:05.526
are in the absence of contact.

1:15:15.034 --> 1:15:15.902
Hey.

1:15:17.036 --> 1:15:17.871
You're here.

1:15:18.838 --> 1:15:21.204
Yeah well, I didn't have
anywhere else to be.

1:15:21.206 --> 1:15:23.576
I figured you'd probably
be too hung over.

1:15:24.376 --> 1:15:26.045
Trust me, I am.

1:15:28.046 --> 1:15:32.749
Um, okay, so I have peer
tutoring after school,

1:15:32.751 --> 1:15:34.385
and then I was thinking
that maybe I could come

1:15:34.387 --> 1:15:36.052
to your house afterwards
and we could talk

1:15:36.054 --> 1:15:37.323
about the prison inmate thing.

1:15:38.256 --> 1:15:40.658
I think it is a really good idea

1:15:40.660 --> 1:15:43.226
and I'm really happy
that you stuck with this.

1:15:43.228 --> 1:15:45.796
Okay well, I'm working
at the drive-in

1:15:45.798 --> 1:15:46.800
so why don't you
just meet me there?

1:15:47.767 --> 1:15:48.602
Okay.

1:15:52.772 --> 1:15:54.308
Ladies, this bathroom's closed.

1:15:55.073 --> 1:15:56.677
You can't smoke in here.

1:15:57.643 --> 1:15:59.912
And yet here I am, Peter.

1:16:01.747 --> 1:16:03.616
You know I'm gonna have
to report you now, right?

1:16:07.420 --> 1:16:08.755
Come on, come on.

1:16:09.287 --> 1:16:10.590
I got a lotta work to do.

1:16:13.793 --> 1:16:16.929
Okay, that's it,
you're free to go.

1:16:18.263 --> 1:16:19.765
I'm sorry it's been really hard.

1:16:31.143 --> 1:16:32.278
I'll see you on Thursday.

1:17:24.863 --> 1:17:26.700
Shit, the
game's still on me!

1:17:53.860 --> 1:17:55.860
What the fuck, dude?

1:17:55.862 --> 1:17:58.194
I told you no phones on shift.

1:17:58.196 --> 1:18:00.196
Hey Cadence, um it's me.

1:18:00.198 --> 1:18:02.065
I think we made a
mistake with the game.

1:18:02.067 --> 1:18:04.200
I think that it's on me
now and we gotta play

1:18:04.202 --> 1:18:06.203
by 7:47 or something
bad is gonna...

1:18:06.205 --> 1:18:07.538
The mailbox
is full and cannot

1:18:07.540 --> 1:18:08.873
accept messages at this time.

1:18:08.875 --> 1:18:10.310
- Goodbye.
- Ah, fuck!

1:18:11.110 --> 1:18:12.877
You know, that could
be an emergency?

1:18:12.879 --> 1:18:14.848
I'll have you know my
grandma's really ill.

1:18:15.848 --> 1:18:17.384
You told me your
grandma had passed.

1:18:18.384 --> 1:18:20.387
Well I have two grandmas, so...

1:18:24.857 --> 1:18:25.926
Fuck.

1:18:27.393 --> 1:18:28.228
Come on.

1:18:32.231 --> 1:18:34.931
And what that means,
folks, is that if you

1:18:34.933 --> 1:18:36.400
are in the path of that storm,

1:18:36.402 --> 1:18:38.101
and I can't stress this enough,

1:18:38.103 --> 1:18:41.006
you need to take shelter
and protect yourself.

1:19:22.113 --> 1:19:23.279
Peter!

1:19:23.281 --> 1:19:24.950
Hey, hey, Peter!

1:19:26.117 --> 1:19:27.419
Peter, it's me!

1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:28.955
Peter!

1:19:37.295 --> 1:19:38.130
Peter?

1:19:42.300 --> 1:19:44.303
Hello?

1:20:23.942 --> 1:20:24.878
Peter?

1:21:03.381 --> 1:21:04.384
Wait!

1:21:05.384 --> 1:21:06.083
Wait!

1:21:06.085 --> 1:21:07.551
Wait, stop, I need your help!

1:21:07.553 --> 1:21:09.890
Sorry guys, I need your help!

1:21:11.057 --> 1:21:12.556
What the hell happened to you?

1:21:12.558 --> 1:21:14.224
I just need your help.

1:21:14.226 --> 1:21:16.392
I need you to play
this game with me.

1:21:16.394 --> 1:21:17.328
47 hours, it's...

1:21:17.330 --> 1:21:19.062
Have you have a complete
mental breakdown?

1:21:19.064 --> 1:21:21.731
- No, I...
- Let go of me, you freak.

1:21:21.733 --> 1:21:23.400
My life really depends on this.

1:21:23.402 --> 1:21:25.569
Oh good, I'm glad your
life depends on it.

1:21:25.571 --> 1:21:27.738
I hope you do die, you
stupid little bitch.

1:21:27.740 --> 1:21:29.506
You seem to be
under the impression

1:21:29.508 --> 1:21:31.344
that anybody here cares
whether or not you die.

1:21:33.112 --> 1:21:34.080
I'll play with you.

1:21:37.082 --> 1:21:37.918
Really?

1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:41.921
Thank you.

1:21:42.620 --> 1:21:43.923
Thank you so much.

1:21:46.424 --> 1:21:47.427
Okay.

1:21:48.760 --> 1:21:50.260
From the fires of Hell,
we dare you to come

1:21:50.262 --> 1:21:51.965
though darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.

1:21:52.464 --> 1:21:53.599
Okay, now you go
from "fires of hell."

1:21:55.101 --> 1:21:57.167
From the fires of Hell...

1:21:57.169 --> 1:21:57.938
Just right now.

1:22:04.276 --> 1:22:05.111
Aw.

1:22:07.278 --> 1:22:08.113
Oh.

1:22:11.116 --> 1:22:13.150
Stop that crazy bitch!

1:22:13.152 --> 1:22:14.621
She assaulted me
in the bathroom!

1:23:07.372 --> 1:23:09.041
Come on.

1:23:10.675 --> 1:23:11.408
<i>You have reached the</i>

1:23:11.410 --> 1:23:13.345
- <i>voice mailbox...</i>
- Shit.

1:23:59.558 --> 1:24:00.891
Where in the hell do you think

1:24:00.893 --> 1:24:01.891
- you're going?
- I gotta go find Rose.

1:24:01.893 --> 1:24:03.593
Are you crazy, you can't leave.

1:24:03.595 --> 1:24:06.262
There's a damn storm
bearing down on us.

1:24:06.264 --> 1:24:07.898
You know, they act like
there's gonna be a tornado

1:24:07.900 --> 1:24:09.399
every time it fucking
rains in this town

1:24:09.401 --> 1:24:11.237
and nothing ever happens
so I think I'm fine.

1:24:40.933 --> 1:24:42.332
Cadence!

1:24:42.334 --> 1:24:43.432
Whoa, what the hell
happened to you?

1:24:43.434 --> 1:24:44.133
- Where's Cadence?
- She's not here.

1:24:44.135 --> 1:24:45.601
What do you mean she's not here?

1:24:45.603 --> 1:24:46.435
She just left.

1:24:46.437 --> 1:24:47.770
Well, where did she go?

1:24:47.772 --> 1:24:48.771
She went looking for you.

1:24:48.773 --> 1:24:50.173
I told her it wasn't a good idea

1:24:50.175 --> 1:24:51.440
with the damn storm and all.

1:24:51.442 --> 1:24:53.443
Your phone, I need your phone.

1:24:53.445 --> 1:24:55.444
On the wall there.

1:24:55.446 --> 1:24:57.150
Hey, hey girl!

1:24:59.317 --> 1:25:00.152
What are you doing?

1:25:07.625 --> 1:25:08.958
I don't know her number.

1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:10.629
You don't know her number?

1:25:11.496 --> 1:25:12.629
How is that possible?

1:25:12.631 --> 1:25:14.198
You girls call each other
about every five minutes.

1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:15.798
You must have her number, right?

1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:16.967
You got a directory
or something?

1:25:16.969 --> 1:25:19.139
- Probably.
- Okay, so where is it?

1:25:19.671 --> 1:25:21.674
All right, okay, just calm down.

1:25:22.674 --> 1:25:24.341
- Gotta be here somewhere.
- Where do you keep the files?

1:25:24.343 --> 1:25:26.312
- Carbondale directory.
- Yes, yes, Carbondale.

1:25:42.995 --> 1:25:43.830
Fuck.

1:25:45.363 --> 1:25:45.962
Hello?

1:25:45.964 --> 1:25:48.332
Cadence? Thank God.

1:25:48.334 --> 1:25:49.300
Rose, where are you?

1:25:49.302 --> 1:25:51.368
Why haven't you been
picking up your phone?

1:25:51.370 --> 1:25:52.705
There's been a problem
with the game that's...

1:25:54.339 --> 1:25:55.373
There's been some
sort of mistake.

1:25:55.375 --> 1:25:57.673
I need you to get back
here as soon as possible.

1:25:57.675 --> 1:25:59.508
Okay, I'm, I'm coming.

1:26:02.513 --> 1:26:04.681
These storms get any
worse, you get your ass

1:26:04.683 --> 1:26:06.382
to a storm shelter, you hear me?

1:26:06.384 --> 1:26:07.219
Yeah.

1:26:08.519 --> 1:26:10.721
There's been reports of
power flashes from the...

1:26:23.701 --> 1:26:25.204
Cadence!

1:26:27.872 --> 1:26:31.374
I'm here, take it,
take it, take it!

1:26:31.376 --> 1:26:33.543
From the fires of Hell
we dare you to come.

1:26:33.545 --> 1:26:34.380
Rose!

1:27:03.741 --> 1:27:07.279
Rose, Rose, Rose, you're
okay, you're okay.

1:27:08.080 --> 1:27:09.913
I can't feel my leg.

1:27:09.915 --> 1:27:11.480
No, no, you're
okay, you're okay.

1:27:11.482 --> 1:27:13.417
My legs aren't okay.

1:27:13.419 --> 1:27:16.086
Just take it, take it, take it!

1:27:16.088 --> 1:27:16.923
Here.

1:27:18.456 --> 1:27:19.422
From the fires.

1:27:19.424 --> 1:27:21.425
Of Hell we dare you to come.

1:27:21.427 --> 1:27:22.626
- Through the darkness.
- Through the darkness

1:27:22.628 --> 1:27:24.493
and blood, if you're
real pick one.

1:27:24.495 --> 1:27:25.761
Through the fire...

1:27:29.101 --> 1:27:29.936
What?

1:27:32.103 --> 1:27:34.471
Cadence, what's wrong?

1:27:34.473 --> 1:27:35.105
Nothing.

1:27:35.107 --> 1:27:36.440
Cadence.

1:27:36.442 --> 1:27:38.778
You're okay, it's
just a stupid game.

1:27:54.625 --> 1:27:57.127
And a huge chunk
of the movie screen

1:27:57.129 --> 1:27:59.966
falls from the sky
and cuts Rose in half.

1:28:00.799 --> 1:28:01.668
And?

1:28:02.668 --> 1:28:04.637
That's it, he got her.

1:28:05.804 --> 1:28:08.971
Stupid bitches, they
tried to outsmart it.

1:28:08.973 --> 1:28:10.806
That never works.

1:28:10.808 --> 1:28:12.141
Right.

1:28:12.143 --> 1:28:15.479
And all the demons I've
ever summoned hate that.

1:28:15.481 --> 1:28:17.317
Have you ever even
really tried it?

1:28:18.983 --> 1:28:19.986
I'm serious!

1:28:21.487 --> 1:28:23.456
Whatever, it's not real.

1:28:24.122 --> 1:28:25.357
Of course it's not real.

1:28:26.692 --> 1:28:29.493
Oh my God, you're
fucking scared.

1:28:29.495 --> 1:28:31.363
No I'm not, I'm kidding.

1:28:32.531 --> 1:28:33.366
I'm kidding.

1:28:35.534 --> 1:28:36.369
Okay.

1:28:37.536 --> 1:28:38.371
Let's play.

1:28:40.505 --> 1:28:42.705
From the fires of Hell,
we dare you to come

1:28:42.707 --> 1:28:45.574
through darkness and blood,
if you're real pick one.
