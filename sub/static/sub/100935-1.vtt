Venezuela when I was seven.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.160

lady, Miss Janna.

<i> Lorena: He's a soldier</i>

He's really cute,
and he's so nice to me.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.364
- You've only been here
a couple months.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.399
You don't waste any time.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.335
- Oh, it's not like that.
He just ask me to dance,

04:30.437 --> 04:32.738
and then we talk...

04:34.308 --> 04:35.841
I think I like him.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.709
- Only fools rush in, Lorena.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.614
But if he doesn't have three
eyes and a hump on his back,

04:42.716 --> 04:44.883
I'll let you go out with him.
- Oh, thank you, Mrs. Castro!

04:44.985 --> 04:47.853
- But only,
and always, chaperoned.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.621
- (Sighs) He'll think
I'm a child.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.690
<i> - Then he's not worth you.</i>

04:51.792 --> 04:53.625
Your mother would kill me

05:03.137 --> 05:04.169
- (Chuckles lightly)

05:05.739 --> 05:08.473
I hired you to be my son's
nanny, not a maid.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.511
- Can I ask you a question?

05:14.181 --> 05:16.648
Ah.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.551
You have this big,
beautiful house,

05:19.653 --> 05:21.019
a nice car,

05:21.121 --> 05:23.522
you own two nail salons--
- About to have three.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.327
- And you do it all alone,
no husband.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.063
It's very impressive.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.998
I want to know,

05:33.100 --> 05:35.467
how do you get that?

05:35.569 --> 05:37.803
- A helluva lotta hard work.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.840
The new store in Centerville
opens next week!

05:44.311 --> 05:47.579
- You know I'm very grateful
for this job,

05:47.681 --> 05:49.214
and... and Kyle,

05:49.316 --> 05:51.817
he's such a good boy,

05:51.919 --> 05:54.720
but... I think--
- You want more.

05:56.423 --> 05:59.358
- Do you think I could ever
work at your nail store?

05:59.460 --> 06:02.327
- What about Kyle?
- Oh, I can do both.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.796
I can work at the nail store
while Kyle is at school,

06:04.898 --> 06:06.865
and then I can come home
and stay with him

06:06.967 --> 06:09.301
until you get back home.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.870
- You know, I think you could,
too.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.372
I'd be happy to train you.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.973
- (Excited laugh)
Thank you.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.108
- (Chuckles)

06:18.979 --> 06:21.713
- Um, I had a really nice time.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.119
- How many times have I told
you, John?

06:27.221 --> 06:29.554
No kissing.
- Uh, jeez, Mrs. C,

06:29.656 --> 06:31.656
we've been seeing each other
for a month now.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.495
You didn't say I can't kiss you
though!

06:36.597 --> 06:38.430
- Such a bad boy.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.936
What's he doing with a bike?

06:45.038 --> 06:46.838
- He rode it in from Quantico.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.373
- In this weather?

06:48.475 --> 06:51.243
That's 20 miles away!
- Uh, 25, actually.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.779
But I would ride twice that far
just to see my princess.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.013
- (Chuckles)

06:55.115 --> 06:57.182
- I'll see you next week.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.121
(Pool balls clack)

07:03.223 --> 07:07.392
Mercedes: So... you and John are
getting kinda serious, huh?

07:07.494 --> 07:11.363
- I guess so.
It's been eight months.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.465
- I don't get what you see
in him.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.867
- You don't like John?

07:15.969 --> 07:18.637
- He kinda drinks a lot.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.539
And he always "happens"
to forget his wallet

07:20.641 --> 07:22.674
whenever we go out.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.776
- John's a good guy.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.678
Why can't you be happy for me?

07:30.184 --> 07:31.750
- Hey, Warden,

07:31.852 --> 07:33.852
could I have a minute
with my girl?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.121
- I asked you
not to call me that.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.589
I'm gonna go get some fries.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.924
- All right, grab me a beer.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.760
Pfft!

07:45.332 --> 07:47.299
She keeps eating like that,
she'll never find a boyfriend.

07:47.401 --> 07:48.934
- That's not nice, John.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.169
- Oh, what do I care?

07:51.271 --> 07:53.572
Besides, she's not nearly
as hot as you...

07:53.674 --> 07:56.208
and your sexy little body.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.143
- (playful) Stop.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.014
- I uh...

08:03.116 --> 08:04.483
found something
by the pool table.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.318
Do you wanna see what it is?
- Mm-hmm.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.656
- Now...

08:13.093 --> 08:14.826
I know it's not much,

08:14.928 --> 08:16.628
and I know I just found it,

08:17.831 --> 08:19.865
but...

08:22.236 --> 08:23.902
here you are.
- (Gasps)

08:24.004 --> 08:26.538
- Until I get a real diamond.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.241
- (Shocked laugh) Are you
asking me to marry you?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.711
- It's more of a promise.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.913
I don't wanna lose you.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.048
- But I'm not going anywhere.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.252
- Yeah, but you've got this
great job working at the salon

08:40.354 --> 08:42.821
and I don't want some other guy
to come by

08:42.923 --> 08:45.624
and scoop you up.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.225
- I wouldn't do that.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.995
I'm happy with you.

08:50.097 --> 08:53.031
- And I wanna keep it that way.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.967
I want you, Lorena,

08:58.639 --> 09:01.306
all to myself.

09:04.278 --> 09:05.844
I love you.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.414
- I love you, too.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.522
(Giggles happily)

09:19.126 --> 09:21.860
<i>Lorena: I built fantasies of us</i>

09:32.973 --> 09:34.306
I do.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.114

09:43.216 --> 09:46.251
- (Chuckles) Forever and ever.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.456
(Giggles happily)

09:59.800 --> 10:01.900
- Is that a new blouse?

10:02.002 --> 10:04.369
Did you go shopping without me?

10:04.471 --> 10:06.438
- I got it from the PX
at Quantico.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.775
Now that I'm married,
I get base privileges.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.744
Oh, and there's an amazing
grocery store,

10:12.846 --> 10:16.014
and gas is half the price there.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.450
I just feel so blessed with
everything that's happened.

10:18.552 --> 10:20.552
- You know,
if John's got any buddies

10:20.654 --> 10:22.487
that you want to set me up with

10:22.589 --> 10:24.756
then, I wouldn't mind having
your life, either.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.858
- Maybe you would like Todd.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.528
- Who's that?
And is he as hot as John?

10:30.631 --> 10:33.431
- (Laughs) No one is as
handsome as John.

10:34.868 --> 10:38.169
And Todd is his cousin.
He came from New York,

10:38.271 --> 10:40.572
he's staying with us for awhile.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.574
- I mean, you've only been
married a couple of weeks

10:42.676 --> 10:44.342
and somebody's already living
with you?

10:44.444 --> 10:46.244
<i> That seems kinda messed up.</i>

10:46.346 --> 10:48.246
- They grew up together.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.181
John says they're like brothers.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.450
- Still, so what?
Your place is tiny!

10:52.552 --> 10:55.687
And, I mean,
that's gotta cramp your...

10:55.789 --> 10:58.256
your "newlywed" activities.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.759
- We find... time.

11:02.729 --> 11:06.331
Besides, family is very
important to the both of us.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.435
And John says it'll only be
for a couple of weeks.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.537
- Well, John says a lot
of things.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.273
What do you say?

11:17.811 --> 11:20.612

- Hey, baby.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.424
What's got you so excited?

11:32.526 --> 11:34.259
- A surprise!

11:34.361 --> 11:37.762
I made reservations for us at
Blackbird's tonight for dinner.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.398
- That fancy place in DC?
- Mm-hmm.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.333
- I can't afford that.
- I can!

11:42.436 --> 11:44.202
I got my first paycheck today.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.710
- Okay.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.978
<i> Uh, yeah, I guess.</i>

11:54.081 --> 11:57.082
But that,
that place is so stuffy.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.817
Let's just go to Chelsea's.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.786
- But I want to celebrate...
some place special.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.855
- Hey, Chelsea's has wings.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.124
Oh, you love wings!

12:06.226 --> 12:08.393
Please?

12:08.495 --> 12:10.195
You wanna make me happy,
don't you?

12:10.297 --> 12:11.796

12:11.898 --> 12:13.598
(Toilet flushes)

12:13.700 --> 12:16.468
- Hey! Grab your jacket, cous,
we're headed to Chelsea's.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.636
Lorena's treat.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.171
Todd: (Laughs)
- Isn't she the best?

12:20.273 --> 12:21.940
- Awesome, dude.

12:24.211 --> 12:25.577
Thanks!

12:26.680 --> 12:28.646
- John. John.
- What?

12:31.852 --> 12:34.185
- I thought it was just
supposed to be the two of us.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.722
- Don't be rude, babe.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.691
Look... if one of your family
was staying with us,

12:39.793 --> 12:41.292
we'd include them.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.249
- John, come on, let's go.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.417
- We just got more shots.
(Glasses clink)

13:06.520 --> 13:08.553
- I'm hungry,
and this is no fun.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.288
- I dunno, Todd and I are
having a blast.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.756
- Two.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.326
- Okay, fine. You two stay
and take a cab home.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.529
I'm leaving.
- Oh yeah?

13:17.631 --> 13:19.664

you're going 85.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.396
- I know what I'm doing.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.198
- John, I'm serious. Slow down!
You're going to get us killed.

- Shut up!
I know what I'm doing!

Why?

15:04.938 --> 15:06.104
- Sir, have you been drinking?

15:06.206 --> 15:09.674
- Uh, a few beers,
but I'm okay.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.277
- I was passing by and saw
a scuffle through the window.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.879
- Oh, we, uh, we just moved in.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.582
We haven't had a time
to put up um...

15:17.684 --> 15:19.684

- Oh!

15:30.030 --> 15:32.163
Oh...

15:32.265 --> 15:33.998
It's not like that.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.067
She gets paranoid sometimes,

15:36.169 --> 15:38.836

her down.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.571
Right, baby?

- Ma'am, are you okay?

15:49.182 --> 15:50.481
Do you wanna stay here?

15:52.852 --> 15:54.652
You have someone
who you can stay with?

15:59.526 --> 16:01.859
- (Shaky) But I want to leave
anyway.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.095
- You betcha. Come on.

<i> It didn't.</i>

16:58.785 --> 17:02.420

the apartment,

17:02.522 --> 17:05.490
in the bedroom, and...

17:05.592 --> 17:08.026
he made me have sex.
(Whimpering)

17:10.897 --> 17:14.198
After, I...
I went to the kitchen and...

17:16.102 --> 17:19.037
(Crying) I took the knife.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.840
Then I don't remember. I...

17:25.011 --> 17:27.645
(Crying)

17:27.747 --> 17:29.614
And then there was so much
blood.

17:29.716 --> 17:33.184
- Yeah, we're aware of
the incident, ma'am.

17:33.286 --> 17:36.320
But, uh, what I need
to know now is, is...

17:37.457 --> 17:39.624
where it is.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.060
<i> The appendage -</i>
<i> what did you do with it?</i>

17:42.162 --> 17:44.028
- What about what that bastard
did to her to make her do this?

17:44.130 --> 17:46.297
- This woman's husband
is here in this hospital

17:46.399 --> 17:48.232
and he's in critical condition.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.901
- (Panicked) John's here?

17:50.003 --> 17:51.702
Please, please,
don't let him find me.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.171
- No, ma'am, I don't think
that's possible.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.740
He's in pretty bad shape.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.175
<i> What we need to do now</i>

17:57.277 --> 18:00.211
is to locate... "it"

18:02.916 --> 18:04.782
to see if they can sew it
back on.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.820
- (Crying) I threw it out
the car window...

18:11.524 --> 18:14.659
on Old C-C-Centreville Road,

18:14.761 --> 18:16.727
n-near a convenience store.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.131
- Send them out.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.300
<i> Do a grid search on Old</i>
<i> Centreville,</i>

18:22.402 --> 18:24.168
<i> around the convenience store.</i>

18:30.143 --> 18:31.943
Okay, so a, a nurse is gonna
come in

18:32.045 --> 18:34.378
and, uh,
administer a PERK exam.

18:35.849 --> 18:37.648
Do you know what that is?

18:41.054 --> 18:42.553
- It's a rape kit, honey.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.056
They're gonna collect evidence

18:45.158 --> 18:47.191
so they can prove
what John did to you.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.395
- All right, ya'll sit tight.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.397
The nurse'll be right in.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.166
- Can I go home after that?

18:56.369 --> 18:58.169
- We're a long way from that.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.843
<i> Lorena: A lot of what happened</i>
<i> the first night was a blur,</i>

19:05.945 --> 19:08.579

terrified.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.349
I have no idea that what
I've done

19:11.451 --> 19:13.618
will change my life forever.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.655
(Crying) John came in
the bedroom

19:17.757 --> 19:20.258
and he took off his clothes
and...

19:21.995 --> 19:24.595
but he kept his underwears on.

19:24.697 --> 19:27.565
- He... he kept them on?

19:28.768 --> 19:30.434
Um... (pages flip)

19:30.537 --> 19:32.103
Yeah.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.307
You said earlier
he took them off.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.442
- Okay, maybe he took them off.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.145
- So which one is it,
Mrs. Bobbitt?

19:41.247 --> 19:44.048
Did he keep them on
or take it off?

19:44.150 --> 19:45.883
- He kept them on.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.318
- Are we gonna be here much
longer?

19:47.420 --> 19:48.786
She's been at this all night.
She hasn't slept--

19:48.888 --> 19:51.055
- Just a couple more questions.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.658
You said earlier you tried
to scream.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.059
- Yes.
- And uh...

19:55.161 --> 19:57.662
your husband's friend, Robbie -
is that his name?

19:57.764 --> 20:00.464
- (Crying) Robbie Johnston.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.834
He came to stay with us
from New York.

20:03.937 --> 20:05.937
He and John went out drinking.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.173
- So... Robbie's sleeping
on a couch

20:09.275 --> 20:11.275
in the living room,

20:11.377 --> 20:13.177
and he doesn't hear anything?

20:15.081 --> 20:17.148
- (Crying) The bedroom door
was closed.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.351
- Still, I'm sure he could've
easily heard you

20:20.453 --> 20:22.286
if, indeed, you did yell.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.754
- Are you insinuating that
she didn't?

20:23.856 --> 20:25.523
- This is an official police
interview.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.691
So, I'm gonna tell you
one last time

20:26.793 --> 20:28.459
to please refrain from talking.

20:31.197 --> 20:34.599
<i> Lorena: I was interrogated</i>
<i> for more than 14 hours,</i>

20:34.701 --> 20:36.867
<i> kept awake all night.</i>

20:36.970 --> 20:39.804
I didn't understand
what was happening

20:39.906 --> 20:42.039
and my English then,

20:42.141 --> 20:44.141
it wasn't so good.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.744
I was never offered
a translator or an attorney

<i> to help me to navigate</i>
<i> through</i>

20:49.616 --> 20:52.783

20:52.885 --> 20:55.686
(Crying) I told him that...

20:55.788 --> 20:57.622
he shouldn't do this to me.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.692
- And? Did he reply?

21:01.794 --> 21:05.463
- (Crying) He said he doesn't
care about my feelings.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.934
(Sniffling and crying)

21:10.036 --> 21:12.336
I ask him...

21:12.438 --> 21:16.540
if he has orgasm inside of me

21:17.910 --> 21:21.479
because it hurt me
when he made me do that.

21:23.983 --> 21:27.251
He always... have orgasm

21:30.890 --> 21:33.257
and he doesn't wait for me

21:34.961 --> 21:36.894
to have orgasm.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.465
He's selfish,

21:43.236 --> 21:46.037
and I don't think it's fair.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.139
So I...

21:48.241 --> 21:50.741
I-I-I pulled,
I pulled back the sheets

21:50.843 --> 21:53.110
and did...

21:53.212 --> 21:56.914
and then...

21:57.016 --> 21:58.516
I did it.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.522
<i> I couldn't even understand</i>

I... that did not exist

22:09.929 --> 22:12.763

22:16.769 --> 22:20.705
that it wouldn't help through
my case

22:20.807 --> 22:22.940
and I was basically
incriminating myself.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.875
What I meant was

22:24.977 --> 22:27.144
that John was just taking
what he wanted.

Man: Okay, we got some less
than-positive news today.

44:06.544 --> 44:09.178
The District Attorney's office
has decided

44:09.280 --> 44:11.314
that John should only be charged

44:11.416 --> 44:15.051
with "marital sexual assault."

44:15.153 --> 44:17.086
- But he raped me.

44:17.188 --> 44:20.056
- Well, Virginia law states
that the charge of rape

44:20.158 --> 44:22.625
can only be applied to couples

44:22.727 --> 44:24.761
who aren't living together
at the time of the incident

physical injury to the victim,

44:27.599 --> 44:29.766
which is you.

44:29.868 --> 44:32.635
Neither of those elements
apply here.

44:32.737 --> 44:35.004
- So, the law says that...

44:35.106 --> 44:37.440
my husband can rape me...

44:37.542 --> 44:39.609
as long as he doesn't
beat me up?

44:39.711 --> 44:41.411
- Unfortunately, yes,

44:41.513 --> 44:44.480
uh, that's how the statute's
currently written.

44:44.582 --> 44:46.182
- How is that fair?

44:48.687 --> 44:51.954
He was abusing me.
I was just... protecting myself.

44:52.057 --> 44:55.224

really hard at your trial.

44:57.395 --> 44:59.562
Lorena, right now,

44:59.664 --> 45:01.964

45:04.035 --> 45:06.135
how they-they spin his side
of the story...

45:09.374 --> 45:11.874
- What happens if they say
I'm guilty?

45:11.976 --> 45:14.477

this charge

45:14.579 --> 45:17.146
of malicious wounding
is a serious one.

45:18.616 --> 45:22.085
If you stand trial
and are found guilty,

48:34.946 --> 48:38.981

48:40.418 --> 48:43.119
I thought he would stop,

48:43.221 --> 48:45.421
that I could make it better,

48:45.523 --> 48:48.758
but he just keep doing it.

48:48.860 --> 48:51.661
And now he took my temporary
green card

48:51.763 --> 48:53.462
and my papers with him.

48:53.564 --> 48:54.931
- Where did he go?

48:55.033 --> 48:57.133
- Back to New York.

48:58.569 --> 49:01.437
He said that immigration
is gonna come

49:01.539 --> 49:03.839
and throw me out of my country.

49:03.942 --> 49:06.442
- No. No, they won't.

49:12.350 --> 49:14.517
<i> Lorena: John constantly</i>

49:14.619 --> 49:17.586
<i> even though my visa status</i>

49:17.689 --> 49:19.588
<i> had nothing to do with him.</i>

49:19.691 --> 49:23.726
He basically used
my visa status

49:23.828 --> 49:26.095
as another weapon
to control me.

49:27.465 --> 49:29.932
(Polaroid camera whirs)

49:32.270 --> 49:34.503
- I'm gonna send these
to the INS.

49:34.605 --> 49:36.105
- What good will that do?

49:36.207 --> 49:38.507
- You can seek asylum
as an abused spouse,

49:38.609 --> 49:40.343
get your permanent green card.

49:40.445 --> 49:42.745
- John says they won't
believe me.

49:42.847 --> 49:44.547
- With these, how can they not?

49:49.454 --> 49:52.088

49:52.190 --> 49:54.590

the jury finds the defendant...

50:20.284 --> 50:22.585
not guilty... (Courtroom cheers)
of marital sexual assault.

50:22.687 --> 50:24.186

The defendant is free to go.

50:26.357 --> 50:29.158
(Low hum of chatter)

50:32.864 --> 50:35.197
Juror: The jury was persuaded
by Mr. Bobbitt's lawyer

50:35.299 --> 50:37.299
that the case was
too circumstantial.

50:37.402 --> 50:40.536
We couldn't rely on
Mrs. Bobbitt's word alone.

50:40.638 --> 50:42.671
If someone had heard her scream

50:42.774 --> 50:45.074
or there'd been some sort of
bruising,

50:45.176 --> 50:47.510
that'd be more substantive
evidence.

50:47.612 --> 50:49.979
- The law said that evidence

50:50.081 --> 50:52.915
from previous abuse
was inadmissible.

50:54.218 --> 50:56.619
That still upsets me
to this day.

50:58.156 --> 50:59.688
- Get lost!

Would you creeps get a life?!

John's acquittal is a blow

52:34.185 --> 52:35.885
We need to tweak our strategy
a little bit,

52:35.987 --> 52:38.521

an open mind.

a couple times

- In addition, we'd like
to plead irresistible impulse.

53:09.353 --> 53:12.288
- What does that mean?

53:12.390 --> 53:15.524
- Well, we would argue
that you, the defendant,

53:15.626 --> 53:17.326
couldn't control your actions

53:17.428 --> 53:20.229
as a result of a mental
disorder.

53:20.331 --> 53:22.731
It's a type of insanity plea.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.869
- But I'm not crazy.

53:26.971 --> 53:29.505
- Here, here's the deal, Lorena.

53:29.607 --> 53:31.907
I'm-I'm not blaming you at all,

53:32.009 --> 53:35.444
nor am I judging you
for what you did.

53:35.546 --> 53:37.446
But you already said
you did it,

53:37.548 --> 53:39.648
you confessed to the police.

53:39.750 --> 53:43.085
- If I do something, I take
responsibility for it.

53:43.187 --> 53:45.387
- So, given that,

53:45.489 --> 53:48.090
we need to argue
why you did it.

53:48.192 --> 53:50.326
- Lorena, we need to put you
up on the stand

53:50.428 --> 53:52.795
so that you can tell everyone
what John did to you.

53:57.101 --> 53:59.568
- You want me to...

53:59.670 --> 54:02.304

54:21.092 --> 54:22.625

- Hey, you...

54:34.739 --> 54:36.872
- What're you doing here?

54:36.974 --> 54:39.441
- I just drove all night
from New York.

54:39.543 --> 54:42.678
Uh, I wanted to catch you
before you went to work.

54:42.780 --> 54:45.614
- I haven't seen or heard
from you in over a year.

54:45.716 --> 54:47.249
I don't want to talk
to you now.

54:47.351 --> 54:49.985
- Then don't, just...

54:50.087 --> 54:52.087
just listen.

54:52.189 --> 54:53.822
Please?

55:01.599 --> 55:02.898
(Door clicks shut)

55:04.001 --> 55:05.367
- Uh...

55:08.839 --> 55:10.906
I've had a lot of time
to think about...

55:11.008 --> 55:13.475
what's important
since I've been gone.

55:17.281 --> 55:19.915
I got counselling, uh,
from Father McMahon,

55:20.017 --> 55:22.551
and I talked to some older
married couples and...

55:25.189 --> 55:27.089
they said that I should admit
my faults,

55:29.460 --> 55:31.760
uh, beg you for forgiveness,

55:33.164 --> 55:34.997
and uh...

55:37.234 --> 55:40.803
and hope and pray that you...
might uh...

55:43.541 --> 55:45.941
uh, give me another chance.

55:49.380 --> 55:51.046
- I can't just magically erase

55:51.148 --> 55:52.681
everything you did
and said to me.

55:52.783 --> 55:54.416
- Oh, I'm not asking you to.

55:57.321 --> 55:58.721
All I want is for another
chance to make you happy.

55:58.823 --> 56:00.689
I-I know I can do that.

56:02.626 --> 56:05.828
- If we try again,

56:05.930 --> 56:08.664
you have to promise
not to hurt me.

56:10.568 --> 56:12.134
- Promise.

56:12.236 --> 56:13.569
I'm gonna stop drinking,

56:13.671 --> 56:15.671
and I am committed to working
on our marriage.

56:18.476 --> 56:21.043
- Swear to me

56:21.145 --> 56:23.779
that, as my husband,

56:23.881 --> 56:25.514
you won't hurt me.

56:25.616 --> 56:27.816
- On my honor as a Marine.

56:42.199 --> 56:45.167
<i> Lorena: People ask why</i>
<i> I went back with him.</i>

56:45.269 --> 56:49.171

I was 22-years-old,

56:51.442 --> 56:54.410
a Catholic,
a virgin before I met him.

56:54.512 --> 56:56.979
I believed so much in marriage.

56:57.081 --> 56:59.381

57:22.540 --> 57:24.039
- Robbie.
- Hi.

57:24.141 --> 57:25.808
- Nice to see you again.
- I told John

57:25.910 --> 57:27.910
I wouldn't get in the way.
- I'll make up the couch.

57:28.012 --> 57:29.711
It's not very comfortable,

57:29.814 --> 57:31.647
but it should do
for a couple of weeks.

57:31.749 --> 57:34.249
John can you go grab the extra
pair of sheets, please?

57:34.351 --> 57:35.818
- Uh, we were just going
to the hardware store

57:35.920 --> 57:37.786
to get some plywood.
- What for?

57:37.888 --> 57:39.388
- Uh, building a partition,

57:39.490 --> 57:42.991
so Robbie can have
his own room.

57:43.093 --> 57:44.960
- I thought you said it was
just for a couple weeks.

57:45.062 --> 57:46.662
<i> - Dude, you said it was cool</i>

57:46.764 --> 57:48.263

with you guys.

57:50.401 --> 57:52.868
- What happened to working on
our marriage?

57:52.970 --> 57:55.137
- We're doing that, baby!
- With Robbie here?

57:55.239 --> 57:57.539
- I-I don't have money for
my own place, man.

57:57.641 --> 57:58.874
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

57:58.976 --> 58:02.077
Lorena's just being bitchy.
- Dude.

58:02.179 --> 58:04.513
Seriously? Uncool.

58:09.186 --> 58:11.687
- You happy now?
You made him leave.

58:11.789 --> 58:14.122
- Is he going to pay the rent?
Buy food? Pay the electric--

58:14.225 --> 58:16.825
- It just doesn't stop
with you, does it?!

58:16.927 --> 58:20.562
Just nag, nag, nag!
At least Robbie can leave.

58:22.433 --> 58:23.799
- So can I.

58:26.170 --> 58:27.669
- Where do you think
you're going?

58:27.771 --> 58:29.438
- Away from you.

58:29.540 --> 58:31.039
It's been six months
since you came back.

58:31.141 --> 58:32.541
You don't have a job,

58:32.643 --> 58:34.476
you flirt with other girls
right under my nose,

58:34.578 --> 58:36.411
you started drinking again,

58:36.514 --> 58:38.447
and you'd rather hang out
with your friends

58:38.549 --> 58:40.382
than spend time with me
in this marriage.

58:41.886 --> 58:43.418
I'm done.

58:44.588 --> 58:46.221
I want a divorce.

58:49.860 --> 58:51.960
- (Deadly calm) You're...

58:52.062 --> 58:53.595
divorcing me.

59:02.640 --> 59:05.207

- I say when we're finished!

59:07.144 --> 59:10.445
Doesn't matter if we're
divorced or separated.

59:10.548 --> 59:12.347
You know I can find you...

59:14.285 --> 59:16.618
and I can screw you
whenever I want.

59:16.720 --> 59:19.988
You're mine, Lorena.

59:20.090 --> 59:22.057
Don't forget it.

59:22.159 --> 59:24.793
- (Gasping for breath)

59:28.465 --> 59:30.198
(Door closes)

59:30.301 --> 59:31.967
(Whimpers)

59:38.576 --> 59:40.042
- Thank you.

59:46.917 --> 59:49.217
Thank you so much
for letting me come over.

59:50.421 --> 59:52.754
I didn't know who else
to talk to.

59:52.856 --> 59:54.489
- You know I'm always here
for you.

59:56.226 --> 59:57.659
Now what's going on?

59:59.363 --> 1:00:00.529
- It's John...

1:00:00.631 --> 1:00:02.264
- Oh...

1:00:04.668 --> 1:00:06.735
I was really hoping it would
work out this time.

1:00:09.540 --> 1:00:11.773
- I know now that
he'll never change.

1:00:13.277 --> 1:00:15.143
The marriage,

1:00:19.083 --> 1:00:20.983
it's over.
(Crying)

1:00:21.085 --> 1:00:23.619
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1:00:26.390 --> 1:00:28.857
Do you wanna stay here?
The guest room is all made up.

1:00:28.959 --> 1:00:30.826
- It doesn't matter.

1:00:30.928 --> 1:00:33.395
He knows where you live.

1:00:33.497 --> 1:00:34.896
He might try to hurt you, too.

1:00:34.999 --> 1:00:36.865
- Well, I'd like to see him try.

1:00:40.938 --> 1:00:43.939
- He watches...

1:00:44.041 --> 1:00:45.507
every move I make.

1:00:48.412 --> 1:00:51.847
Sometimes I think...
he follows me.

1:00:55.119 --> 1:00:57.386

Do you have an opinion,
Dr. Feister,

1:14:02.272 --> 1:14:04.639
as to whether Lorena Bobbitt
was suffering

1:14:04.741 --> 1:14:08.810
from any kind of severe mental
disease or disorder

1:14:08.912 --> 1:14:11.746
at the time when she cut off
her husband's penis?

1:14:11.848 --> 1:14:13.815
- Yes, she suffered from post
traumatic stress disorder,

1:14:13.917 --> 1:14:15.817
major depressive disorder,

1:14:15.919 --> 1:14:18.519
and anxiety disorder.

1:14:18.621 --> 1:14:20.922
- What, if anything,
did these disorders have to do

1:14:21.024 --> 1:14:23.891
with her ability to control her
impulses?

1:14:23.993 --> 1:14:25.526

any control

1:14:25.628 --> 1:14:28.229

1:14:28.331 --> 1:14:31.899
<i> She was already experiencing</i>
<i> extreme distress.</i>

1:14:32.001 --> 1:14:34.769

<i> closed off</i>

1:14:34.871 --> 1:14:37.338
<i> every avenue of escape to her</i>

1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:39.073
because he said to her

1:14:39.175 --> 1:14:42.343
that it really didn't matter
if she left,

1:14:42.445 --> 1:14:44.645
he would continue to be violent
toward her,

1:14:45.882 --> 1:14:48.015
<i> to rape her,</i>

1:14:48.117 --> 1:14:50.751
<i> to abuse her.</i>

1:14:50.854 --> 1:14:53.521
This created, for her,
a kind of impasse.

1:14:53.623 --> 1:14:56.624
<i> A situation that made</i>
<i> her crazy.</i>

1:14:56.726 --> 1:14:58.559
She became psychotic,

1:14:58.661 --> 1:14:59.994
and, at that point in time,

1:15:00.096 --> 1:15:03.364
she attacked the instrument
of her torture.

1:15:04.634 --> 1:15:06.968
That is, her husband's penis.
