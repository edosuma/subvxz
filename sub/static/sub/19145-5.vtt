00:00.901 --> 00:02.568
Previously on Cardinal...

00:02.569 --> 00:05.571
Just please tell me
why you're doing this.

00:05.572 --> 00:06.912
You should be happy.

00:07.074 --> 00:08.454
You were gonna die tonight.

00:09.403 --> 00:10.586
That's Katie's.

00:10.587 --> 00:11.911
Where did you find it?

00:11.912 --> 00:13.246
On Windigo island,

00:13.247 --> 00:14.247
near the mineshaft.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.748
She promised things
would return to normal

00:15.749 --> 00:16.749
when she's back in Financial.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.613
What do you mean, when
she's back in Financial?

00:18.614 --> 00:20.586
Her transfer to CIS,
it's some assignment.

00:20.587 --> 00:21.787
You didn't know that?

00:21.788 --> 00:24.123
My suspect cashed in
chips four nights ago.

00:24.124 --> 00:25.258
Do you think you could

00:25.259 --> 00:26.759
get your hands on some of the money?

00:26.760 --> 00:28.094
Just some serial numbers.

00:28.095 --> 00:30.118
That's fresh money,
straight from the bank.

00:30.119 --> 00:32.298
Why would you launder new bills?

00:32.299 --> 00:33.299
My wife

00:33.300 --> 00:35.101
has bipolar disorder.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.002
It's hard for Kelly
to see her like this.

00:38.105 --> 00:39.772
Woodrow "Woody" Baldwin.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.774
Our thief follows his targets home

00:41.775 --> 00:42.975
with their new stuff.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.577
Then he hits their house later.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.645
- Untie me! Untie me!
- Shh-shh-shh.

00:49.116 --> 00:50.416
I came for the guitar.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:00.354 --> 02:01.654
Found his truck.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.158
Edie.

02:08.027 --> 02:09.495
It's okay. Hey.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.164
Nothing changes.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.907
We're still gonna finish Keith.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.339
We just can't do it here.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.208
Why not?

02:22.209 --> 02:23.509
Because of him.

02:23.877 --> 02:24.877
If someone misses him,

02:24.878 --> 02:25.878
if someone

02:25.879 --> 02:27.713
knows where he went last night.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.534
Maybe someone saw his truck out front.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.517
Can't take that chance.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.020
What are you looking at, Keith?

02:35.389 --> 02:36.689
Where will we go?

02:40.894 --> 02:42.728
I know a place. I do my photos there.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.230
It's safe. It's clean.

02:44.231 --> 02:45.531
No one's there.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.203
Eric?

02:51.405 --> 02:52.705
Eric.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.580
Maybe we should just stop.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.043
Maybe we should just be done.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.382
How does that go?

03:04.951 --> 03:06.252
I mean, how-how does that go?

03:06.253 --> 03:07.553
How does that go?

03:08.088 --> 03:09.588
We just wipe the slate clean?

03:57.971 --> 03:59.311
Just keep your head.

04:00.807 --> 04:01.974
It's just a normal day.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.809
You go to work, get the drugs.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.311
I'll get the new place set up.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.575
We'll take Keith there tonight,

04:06.576 --> 04:07.876
after dark, okay?

04:11.985 --> 04:13.365
There's no excuse.

04:14.321 --> 04:16.789
But right when we
decided to start trying,

04:18.858 --> 04:20.159
I got this assignment.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.534
I knew the transfer was coming.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.298
New department.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.467
New partner.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.806
It all felt like too much.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.830
So you started taking them again?

04:43.850 --> 04:45.150
I never stopped.

04:54.694 --> 04:55.994
I know it's wrong.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.833
You could have said
no to the assignment.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.835
It's a delay.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.538
That's all.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.839
Just to get through this.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.599
I'm tired of being the
one fighting for us, Lise.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.220
If this isn't something that you want,

05:21.221 --> 05:22.521
you need to say so.

05:27.594 --> 05:28.594
It is.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.936
I ran the numbers twice.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.404
The money Cardinal used to buy chips

05:38.405 --> 05:40.072
is straight from the bank.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.533
It doesn't come from Corbett.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.895
He's laundering his own money?

05:44.244 --> 05:45.578
Clean money?

05:45.579 --> 05:46.912
Why?

05:46.913 --> 05:48.113
Same reason you'd

05:48.114 --> 05:49.414
launder dirty money.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.085
You disrupt the
connection to the source.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.920
It means he's not getting payoffs.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.889
No, it means he's paying someone,

05:57.924 --> 06:00.593
someone he doesn't want
to be associated with.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.728
So he's covering his tracks.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.310
God, this is good, Delorme.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.232
This is confirmation.

06:07.634 --> 06:08.634
I don't see it.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.603
Look, Cardinal tipped off Corbett.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.904
That part we know.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.739
He got a cop killed.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.107
That's a hell of a secret.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.131
That's the kind of secret

06:16.132 --> 06:17.632
that you pay to keep quiet.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.948
Come on. What is it?

06:22.949 --> 06:24.249
I don't know.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.287
I've worked with Cardinal now.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.495
I wonder if he'd do it.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.330
You said it yourself.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.932
Would he doesn't matter.

06:49.309 --> 06:50.676
Because he did.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.811
You did good work, Delorme.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.480
You find out who this guy is paying off,

06:54.481 --> 06:55.481
we got him.

07:18.505 --> 07:19.805
John.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.730
You know how stupid it is to come here?

07:27.714 --> 07:29.014
How'd you find my house?

07:29.683 --> 07:31.183
Followed you from the station.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.352
Yesterday.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.914
Drove all over this pretty little town.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.931
You even know how to use that thing?

07:41.394 --> 07:43.328
Don't think it's very complicated.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.034
What's this?

08:22.068 --> 08:23.435
Everything I could manage

08:23.436 --> 08:25.037
short of selling my house.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.146
Will you walk out of here with that?

08:29.075 --> 08:30.575
I never want to see you again.

08:33.580 --> 08:34.919
Didn't agree to a buy-out.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.049
Six months ago,

08:40.086 --> 08:41.385
I caught this case.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.423
Katie Pine.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.291
A missing twelve-year-old girl.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.592
It was my job

08:48.428 --> 08:49.728
to find her.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.711
But I didn't ask the right questions,

08:54.601 --> 08:56.221
didn't look in the right corners.

08:59.439 --> 09:00.939
And the man who did that

09:04.310 --> 09:05.610
hasn't stopped.

09:08.782 --> 09:09.948
Are you

09:09.949 --> 09:11.450
trying to put this on me?

09:18.958 --> 09:20.459
I can't do this anymore.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.129
What about the dead cop?

09:24.130 --> 09:25.750
You don't care about him anymore?

09:28.802 --> 09:30.302
More than you'll ever know.

09:30.970 --> 09:32.270
So you'll keep paying.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.606
Or I'll tell the world.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.168
My partner's investigating me.

09:37.677 --> 09:38.977
If we keep this up,

09:40.013 --> 09:41.814
we'll be caught.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.148
I have no doubt.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.449
Is he any good?

09:46.519 --> 09:47.819
She is, yeah.

09:52.358 --> 09:53.658
And for a second there,

09:54.994 --> 09:57.830
I thought you were making
a plea from the heart

09:57.831 --> 09:59.832
but you're just afraid
of getting caught,

09:59.833 --> 10:01.834
just like everybody else.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.135
Take the money.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.004
Never come back.

11:27.676 --> 11:28.976
Hey kiddo.

11:30.937 --> 11:31.937
What? You're here-

11:31.938 --> 11:33.238
you're here now?

11:34.907 --> 11:35.907
Well I don't understand.

11:35.908 --> 11:37.208
I thought you were...

11:37.577 --> 11:38.877
what about class?

11:40.079 --> 11:41.079
Well sure, sure.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.747
I'll-I'll-I'll come pick you up.

11:42.748 --> 11:44.048
I'll be right there.

11:44.917 --> 11:46.217
Hey.

11:47.570 --> 11:49.170
You should have told me you were coming.

11:49.171 --> 11:50.638
I'd have got you a flight.

11:50.923 --> 11:52.724
You would have said not to come.

11:52.792 --> 11:53.792
That's okay.

11:53.793 --> 11:55.093
Anyway, I like the bus.

11:55.595 --> 11:56.895
Well it's just

11:57.263 --> 11:58.763
it's not a great time, Kel.

11:58.764 --> 11:59.764
I know.

11:59.765 --> 12:01.065
I saw the news.

12:01.601 --> 12:03.301
I thought you can use some company.

12:04.270 --> 12:05.570
Hey, what's a Form 1?

12:06.105 --> 12:07.405
Why do you ask?

12:08.274 --> 12:09.894
'Cause that's what mom is.

12:10.443 --> 12:12.666
According to the nurse who
wouldn't let me speak to her,

12:12.667 --> 12:13.967
she's a Form 1.

12:18.117 --> 12:19.417
It's just,

12:19.785 --> 12:22.120
it's just the way they-they keep track.

12:22.121 --> 12:23.421
Dad,

12:23.789 --> 12:25.290
I came all the way here.

12:28.828 --> 12:30.128
Form 1

12:31.464 --> 12:32.631
means that she's a,

12:32.632 --> 12:35.634
a danger to herself and
possibly to other people.

12:35.635 --> 12:39.938
So she's in the hospital involuntarily.

12:41.807 --> 12:43.942
So is it as bad as it's ever been?

12:45.622 --> 12:46.645
That's not what you said.

12:49.015 --> 12:50.015
I want to see her.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.620
Cardinal.

12:55.655 --> 12:57.322
White male, forties,

12:57.323 --> 12:59.991
dumped sometime last night
or early this morning.

12:59.992 --> 13:02.827
Well that's way too
old to be Keith London.

13:02.828 --> 13:04.329
So who is this?

13:04.330 --> 13:05.497
No ID yet,

13:05.498 --> 13:07.641
but I'm guessing it's
connected to the burnt out truck

13:07.642 --> 13:09.109
my boys found off Mukwa Road.

13:10.503 --> 13:11.836
Any sign of torture?

13:11.837 --> 13:13.672
It's hard to say yet.

13:13.673 --> 13:15.053
He's wrapped up pretty good

13:16.008 --> 13:18.142
but it does look like he was tortured.

13:21.380 --> 13:22.680
IDENT found it nearby.

13:25.351 --> 13:28.486
Our corpse has all ten of his
so they're running the print.

13:37.530 --> 13:39.510
Tell me you're up for
this right now, John.

13:45.705 --> 13:47.005
What's on your mind, Jer?

13:49.909 --> 13:51.543
If more had been done to stop this guy

13:51.544 --> 13:53.545
back when it was just an Indian girl,

13:53.546 --> 13:55.126
none of this would be happening.

13:56.749 --> 14:00.051
I defended you more times than you know.

14:00.052 --> 14:01.720
Even when it cost me.

14:01.721 --> 14:04.222
Said you were one of the good ones.

14:04.223 --> 14:05.523
Clean.

14:06.759 --> 14:08.059
Maybe I'm a fool.

14:15.601 --> 14:16.901
Your partner's here.

14:43.763 --> 14:45.063
Cardinal?

14:46.098 --> 14:47.398
It's our B&E suspect.

14:52.772 --> 14:54.072
It's Woody Baldwin.

15:40.319 --> 15:41.619
Dammit.

15:52.665 --> 15:53.965
Edie, what's going on?

15:54.834 --> 15:56.634
I-I dropped my earring.

15:58.170 --> 15:59.470
Jesus.

15:59.839 --> 16:01.139
There it is.

16:02.007 --> 16:03.307
What happened to you?

16:03.709 --> 16:05.643
It's, it's stupid, I

16:07.346 --> 16:08.880
tripped on the steps at my house.

16:08.881 --> 16:09.881
I, um,

16:09.882 --> 16:11.482
hit my head on the railing.

16:13.052 --> 16:14.652
You need to see a doctor.

16:15.554 --> 16:16.854
I did.

16:17.022 --> 16:18.322
He said I'm fine.

16:18.357 --> 16:19.524
You should go home.

16:19.525 --> 16:20.692
Rest.

16:20.693 --> 16:22.353
I'll get someone to cover for you.

16:23.195 --> 16:24.495
Okay.

16:35.207 --> 16:36.507
Hello.

16:40.546 --> 16:41.846
Here you go.

16:43.582 --> 16:44.882
I have some good news.

16:46.552 --> 16:47.719
Your daughter called.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.020
She's coming by.

16:50.556 --> 16:51.856
Kelly's here?

16:52.391 --> 16:54.425
And the doctor thinks

16:54.426 --> 16:55.560
it'll be

16:55.561 --> 16:57.461
nice for you to spend
some time together.

17:00.399 --> 17:03.735
She sounds so grown up.

17:03.736 --> 17:04.736
How old is she now?

17:04.737 --> 17:06.037
Um, sixteen?

17:09.575 --> 17:10.909
Catherine.

17:10.910 --> 17:12.210
She's seventeen.

17:14.246 --> 17:15.546
Well,

17:17.950 --> 17:19.550
it'll be nice to see her.

17:22.755 --> 17:24.055
Yeah, thanks.

17:26.258 --> 17:28.259
The finger belongs to Keith London.

17:28.260 --> 17:29.727
Make this make sense to me.

17:32.264 --> 17:33.298
Woody was on the job.

17:33.299 --> 17:34.299
He hit the wrong house.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.100
He paid with his life.

17:36.101 --> 17:37.268
This is a quick kill,

17:37.269 --> 17:38.569
hasty disposal.

17:38.938 --> 17:40.518
I think the killer was surprised

17:42.141 --> 17:43.141
and he's off plan.

17:43.142 --> 17:44.442
He'll make a mistake.

17:46.111 --> 17:47.571
Talk to Woody Baldwin's wife.

17:53.953 --> 17:55.453
I'm so sorry about last night.

17:56.733 --> 17:58.156
I don't know what Josh was thinking

17:58.157 --> 17:59.457
coming to your place.

18:01.293 --> 18:02.593
He told me he, um,

18:03.329 --> 18:04.963
he shared some stuff.

18:04.964 --> 18:06.264
It's none of my business.

18:07.266 --> 18:09.167
You must think I am an asshole.

18:09.168 --> 18:11.508
Whatever else is going on in your life,

18:13.472 --> 18:14.772
park it.

18:42.668 --> 18:45.003
Mrs. Baldwin, I'm Detective Cardinal

18:45.004 --> 18:46.971
and this is Detective Delorme.

18:53.012 --> 18:54.679
When he didn't come home, I

18:58.350 --> 18:59.817
we had had a disagreement

19:00.886 --> 19:03.187
and I just thought that
he was blowing off steam.

19:05.357 --> 19:08.359
Do you have any idea
where he went last night?

19:08.360 --> 19:09.827
No, no.

19:11.897 --> 19:13.197
Mrs. Baldwin,

19:15.367 --> 19:18.536
we think your husband
was working last night,

19:18.537 --> 19:19.917
that he was robbing houses.

19:22.541 --> 19:23.541
I don't know, I just-

19:23.542 --> 19:24.842
Mrs. Baldwin.

19:27.379 --> 19:28.913
We need to find who did this.

19:32.718 --> 19:35.219
I begged him to stop. I-I did, I just-

19:35.220 --> 19:37.388
We think it's possible

19:37.389 --> 19:40.191
that your husband broke
into that person's house.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.568
He checked things online.

19:50.569 --> 19:52.904
He researched them to
see what they were worth.

19:52.905 --> 19:54.008
Okay, here we are.

19:54.009 --> 19:55.309
Yesterday's history.

19:56.442 --> 19:58.776
A whole bunch of searches for Ovation,

19:58.777 --> 19:59.911
Keith's guitar.

19:59.912 --> 20:01.913
Okay, so he spots Keith with the guitar

20:01.914 --> 20:03.414
or spots the killer himself

20:03.415 --> 20:05.083
who's taken the guitar from Keith.

20:05.084 --> 20:06.284
Follows him home.

20:06.285 --> 20:08.453
We know Woody found
his targets at the mall.

20:08.454 --> 20:11.089
Why does the killer take
the guitar to the mall?

20:11.090 --> 20:12.090
Try to resell it?

20:12.091 --> 20:13.391
Get it appraised?

20:15.127 --> 20:17.261
There's a music store
at the South Ridge Mall.

20:18.931 --> 20:20.231
Catherine?

20:20.766 --> 20:22.146
You have a special visitor.

20:24.770 --> 20:25.770
Catherine?

20:38.618 --> 20:40.285
Maybe she's in the common room?

20:40.286 --> 20:41.786
No, I was just there.

20:46.792 --> 20:48.259
Catherine, are you in there?

21:00.640 --> 21:01.973
What? What is it?

21:01.974 --> 21:03.808
Her coat and boots are gone.

21:09.482 --> 21:10.649
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Hi.

21:10.650 --> 21:13.485
I'm Detective Delorme.
Detective Cardinal.

21:13.486 --> 21:15.320
We need to know if a customer brought in

21:15.321 --> 21:16.655
an Ovation guitar last night,

21:16.656 --> 21:18.823
maybe to sell or repair.

21:18.824 --> 21:21.493
No. Well, not a customer.

21:21.494 --> 21:22.694
Well you've seen one?

21:22.695 --> 21:24.329
Yeah. One of my staff just bought one,

21:24.330 --> 21:25.513
brought it in to restring it.

21:25.514 --> 21:26.364
Why? What's up?

21:26.365 --> 21:27.999
An employee? What's his name?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.300
Eric.

21:29.335 --> 21:30.335
Fraser.

21:30.336 --> 21:32.671
The guitar's hot, isn't it?

21:32.672 --> 21:34.005
Is, Eric here?

21:34.006 --> 21:36.007
No. Not till tomorrow.

21:36.008 --> 21:37.842
Look, I'm gonna need you to call him

21:37.843 --> 21:39.678
and tell him he has to come in to,

21:39.679 --> 21:40.979
to fill in for someone.

21:41.180 --> 21:42.180
I can't.

21:42.181 --> 21:43.848
He doesn't believe in cell phones.

21:43.849 --> 21:45.350
Some kinda, I don't know,

21:45.351 --> 21:47.218
philosophical objection.

21:47.219 --> 21:48.219
We'll need his address.

21:48.220 --> 21:49.521
Yeah. Sure. Give me a sec.

21:49.522 --> 21:52.023
Look, I'm gonna post someone here.

21:52.024 --> 21:55.026
If Eric happens to come
before the officer arrives,

21:55.027 --> 21:57.195
I want you not to tell him we were here.

21:57.196 --> 21:58.496
Do you understand?

21:58.531 --> 22:00.498
You just step away and call me.

22:02.535 --> 22:03.535
All right.

22:03.536 --> 22:04.869
I'll get a patrol here.

22:04.870 --> 22:05.870
Call Flower,

22:05.871 --> 22:07.372
see what CPIC has on Fraser.

22:13.546 --> 22:14.546
What?

22:19.251 --> 22:21.019
Katie Pine was here.

22:26.225 --> 22:27.525
We got him.

22:28.058 --> 22:29.090
Good afternoon.

22:29.091 --> 22:31.559
We begin this hour with breaking news.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.727
Algonquin Bay Police

22:32.728 --> 22:34.929
are investigating a suspicious death

22:34.930 --> 22:36.731
following the discovery of a man's body

22:36.732 --> 22:37.799
this morning.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.101
The man was found in the
woods near Hartley Road

22:40.102 --> 22:41.402
around 9 am

22:41.403 --> 22:43.571
and was pronounced dead at the scene.

22:43.572 --> 22:45.573
The victim's identity is being withheld

22:45.574 --> 22:47.775
but an ABPD spokesman described him as

22:47.776 --> 22:49.076
known to police.

22:50.245 --> 22:51.613
How could this happen?

22:51.614 --> 22:52.947
Don't worry, okay?

22:52.948 --> 22:54.248
We're gonna find her.

22:55.584 --> 22:57.251
Hey. I checked around the building.

22:57.252 --> 22:58.552
She's not on the grounds.

22:59.755 --> 23:01.255
Your mom's been doing really well.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.256
She'll be okay.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.777
Yeah, well, she couldn't have gone far

23:03.778 --> 23:05.612
but I'll drive around,
take a look around.

23:05.613 --> 23:06.727
I'm coming with you.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.597
Eric Fraser,

23:09.598 --> 23:10.765
two charges of mischief,

23:10.766 --> 23:11.933
one in Sault Ste. Marie,

23:11.934 --> 23:13.134
and one in Markham

23:13.135 --> 23:15.937
and two years ago a theft charge,

23:15.938 --> 23:17.238
Markham again.

23:19.108 --> 23:21.409
It got him ninety days in Algoma.

23:21.977 --> 23:23.277
Family?

23:23.445 --> 23:24.745
None listed.

23:28.283 --> 23:29.583
You've done this before?

23:30.786 --> 23:32.086
Lots of times.

23:33.322 --> 23:34.622
At the range.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.791
Yeah, saw him come in earlier.

23:36.792 --> 23:37.825
Why? Is he in,

23:37.826 --> 23:39.427
is he in some kind of trouble?

23:44.967 --> 23:46.267
He's right up there.

23:46.301 --> 23:47.601
Number four.

23:49.638 --> 23:51.338
- The doorbell doesn't work.
- Okay.

23:57.646 --> 23:58.946
Mr. Fraser?

24:03.519 --> 24:04.819
Mr. Fraser!

24:23.839 --> 24:25.139
No?

24:27.342 --> 24:28.642
No.

24:34.183 --> 24:36.184
It's too small.

24:36.185 --> 24:37.208
There's not enough space.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.509
No, and too public.

24:39.722 --> 24:43.024
Up and down those
stairs with his victims.

24:43.025 --> 24:46.027
No. He must have another space.

24:46.028 --> 24:47.328
Get a BOLO out.

24:48.063 --> 24:49.063
Yeah.

24:56.872 --> 24:58.039
Hello?

24:58.040 --> 24:59.507
Is the basement clean?

25:00.375 --> 25:01.676
Yeah.

25:01.677 --> 25:03.900
You flushed the drains?
You did everything I said?

25:03.901 --> 25:05.379
Yeah. I did.

25:05.380 --> 25:06.380
Listen to me.

25:06.381 --> 25:07.548
What's wrong?

25:07.549 --> 25:09.884
You need to get Keith out of your house.

25:09.885 --> 25:11.185
What?

25:12.221 --> 25:13.881
They found the thief's body.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.557
How?

25:16.558 --> 25:17.858
I don't know.

25:19.228 --> 25:21.362
But it could lead the
police to your place.

25:23.065 --> 25:24.365
Edie.

25:25.234 --> 25:26.534
Edie.

25:26.935 --> 25:29.270
It doesn't matter because
they won't find anything

25:29.271 --> 25:31.211
because you're gonna
get him out of there.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.740
I can't.

25:33.776 --> 25:35.076
I can't lift him.

25:37.246 --> 25:39.580
I'm twenty minutes away from your place.

25:39.581 --> 25:40.881
This has to happen now.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.050
You can do it.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.720
I believe in you.

25:57.633 --> 25:59.293
You can't blame yourself for this.

26:00.469 --> 26:01.769
I stress her out.

26:02.437 --> 26:05.106
Hey, everyone stresses out their mom.

26:05.107 --> 26:06.407
I know I do.

26:06.775 --> 26:08.742
Does your mom run off into the snow?

26:14.650 --> 26:15.950
Sorry. It's just...

26:17.953 --> 26:19.773
everyone thinks that they have advice.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.126
Fraser drives a red van.

26:25.127 --> 26:27.628
BOLO's gone out with the tags.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.130
Do you want an IDENT team here?

26:29.131 --> 26:30.298
Yeah.

26:30.299 --> 26:32.300
Why don't we park the
whole circus out front

26:32.301 --> 26:34.302
so he can see us from blocks away?

26:34.303 --> 26:35.603
Any other bright ideas?

26:37.472 --> 26:39.974
Hey. I'm just as frustrated as you are.

26:39.975 --> 26:41.275
Somehow I doubt it.

26:46.982 --> 26:48.605
Is there something on your mind?

26:48.606 --> 26:50.318
Yeah. That kid out there

26:50.319 --> 26:52.153
who's probably already dead

26:52.154 --> 26:54.655
and I'm gonna carry that
around for the rest of my days.

26:54.656 --> 26:55.656
Are you?

26:55.657 --> 26:56.858
Or are you moving on?

26:56.859 --> 26:58.459
What is this, a pain contest?

26:59.494 --> 27:00.761
Because I concede.

27:01.630 --> 27:02.830
You are an asshole,

27:02.831 --> 27:04.131
to answer your question.

27:05.334 --> 27:08.002
You don't back into this job, Delorme.

27:08.003 --> 27:09.170
You don't half ass it

27:09.171 --> 27:11.005
until something better comes along.

27:11.006 --> 27:12.340
Maybe that worked in Financial.

27:12.341 --> 27:13.641
Maybe it works at home.

27:14.877 --> 27:16.177
But not here.

27:18.013 --> 27:20.147
Because your focus is
one hundred percent.

27:24.019 --> 27:25.839
Whatever you think you're looking for,

27:26.688 --> 27:27.988
there's nothing to find.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.527
Where are you going?

27:33.528 --> 27:35.668
To call Eric Fraser's Parole Officer.

28:43.098 --> 28:44.932
All right, you got it.

28:49.104 --> 28:50.404
What's this?

28:51.606 --> 28:53.574
One batch labelled "October".

28:54.609 --> 28:55.909
That's Katie Pine.

28:57.112 --> 28:58.946
One labelled "January".

28:58.947 --> 29:00.247
Todd Curry.

29:03.652 --> 29:04.952
Nothing for this month.

29:05.287 --> 29:06.587
No Keith.

29:07.956 --> 29:09.536
He hasn't finished with him yet.

29:13.295 --> 29:14.635
And they're all close-ups.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.464
Could be taken anywhere.

29:16.465 --> 29:18.466
Yeah, but where does he process them?

29:18.467 --> 29:20.801
He needs space, power, water.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.269
Not some hole in the ground.

29:24.506 --> 29:25.806
What?

29:26.641 --> 29:28.544
Parole Officer said he
worked at the music store

29:28.545 --> 29:30.445
for the last eight
months and before that

29:31.680 --> 29:33.420
as a night guard at Holder Security.

29:35.183 --> 29:37.163
That's the same company
as Maureen LaBelle.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.820
That's where he spotted Billy LaBelle.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.990
And he'd have access to properties,

29:42.991 --> 29:45.159
empty buildings, warehouses.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.994
So we need a vacant space

29:46.995 --> 29:49.363
that was under contract
to Holder Security

29:49.364 --> 29:50.964
while Eric was working for them.

29:52.167 --> 29:53.467
There can't be that many.

30:01.376 --> 30:02.976
Please make it stop.

30:04.513 --> 30:07.014
Please. I'm scared.

30:17.514 --> 30:18.514
There. Stop. That's her.

30:28.692 --> 30:29.992
Mom?

30:31.228 --> 30:32.528
Honey?

30:33.063 --> 30:34.530
What are you doing here?

30:34.531 --> 30:35.831
Mom, you scared me.

30:38.068 --> 30:39.235
I just...

30:39.236 --> 30:40.836
I wanted to clear my head.

30:42.405 --> 30:44.265
I couldn't talk myself into going back.

30:46.543 --> 30:48.010
Your hands must be freezing.

30:55.051 --> 30:56.351
Restraints.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.687
From when they brought me in.

31:01.057 --> 31:02.917
You shouldn't have to see me like this.

31:14.404 --> 31:15.704
How's the ice this year?

31:20.243 --> 31:21.543
It was late.

31:22.579 --> 31:24.880
Fishing huts didn't go out
till the end of January.

31:28.084 --> 31:29.384
It looks solid now.

32:02.786 --> 32:04.086
He's here.

32:07.457 --> 32:09.291
Dispatch, this is DC Delorme.

32:09.292 --> 32:10.807
We need all available units

32:10.808 --> 32:13.110
to the Brandell School
on Kildare Avenue.

32:13.111 --> 32:14.111
Armed subject,

32:14.112 --> 32:15.112
possible hostage.

32:15.113 --> 32:16.280
We need full ERT.

34:54.105 --> 34:55.572
Please make it stop.

34:56.774 --> 34:57.774
Please.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.754
Please, I'm scared.

35:12.123 --> 35:13.423
Please stop.

35:19.297 --> 35:20.297
Please.

35:38.483 --> 35:39.983
Please, I'm scared.

35:41.652 --> 35:43.820
Please stop.

35:49.327 --> 35:50.550
It's in the vest!

35:50.551 --> 35:52.017
Go! Go!

38:07.965 --> 38:09.265
Eric.

38:13.004 --> 38:14.304
Where's Keith?

38:20.478 --> 38:21.778
Where's Keith?

39:00.017 --> 39:01.317
John!

39:17.680 --> 39:20.048
We checked every inch of the school.

39:20.049 --> 39:21.650
There's no sign of Keith London.

39:23.186 --> 39:24.926
We're looking for a body, aren't we?

39:28.024 --> 39:30.025
You should go to the hospital,

39:30.026 --> 39:31.326
get that looked at.

39:40.203 --> 39:41.503
You okay?

39:41.871 --> 39:43.171
Yeah. Nothing broken.

39:47.377 --> 39:49.378
He's gonna need a change of clothes.

39:49.379 --> 39:50.579
Yeah. I'll get it.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.105
Chateau Guay Motel.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.267
What happened?

41:53.970 --> 41:55.270
They got Eric.

42:00.310 --> 42:01.810
You don't have to do this.

42:04.514 --> 42:06.281
I could tell them that he hurt you.

42:09.485 --> 42:10.986
You can let me go.

42:16.659 --> 42:17.659
Please. Okay?

42:17.660 --> 42:18.960
You can let me go.

42:21.164 --> 42:22.164
Please.

42:31.507 --> 42:32.807
No.

42:33.843 --> 42:34.843
I can't.
