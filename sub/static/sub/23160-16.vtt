WEBVTT

00:00.017 --> 00:01.109
No!

00:01.185 --> 00:03.619
Are you telling me we're
not staying here? Yes.

00:04.889 --> 00:06.880
I forgot my loincloth and spear.

00:06.957 --> 00:08.288
Will you just keep quiet?

00:08.359 --> 00:11.328
The last time you were here some
poor guy tried to hang himself...

00:11.395 --> 00:12.657
because you wouldn't shut up!

00:12.730 --> 00:16.791
If he so much as touches one hair
on her head, I'm gonna kill him.

00:16.967 --> 00:19.800
Let me have Blanche and the butler guy,
and we'll call it even.

00:19.870 --> 00:21.030
I'm gonna kill you.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.203
Harder, harder!

01:45.123 --> 01:46.954
<i>Welcome to St. Louis.</i>

01:47.025 --> 01:48.993
<i>Maybe it ain't
the best of towns...</i>

01:49.061 --> 01:50.892
<i>but it ain't the worst, either.</i>

01:50.963 --> 01:54.831
<i>So what if the football team and the
baseball team got to share the same nickname?</i>

01:54.900 --> 01:57.368
<i>Who cares? I call it home.</i>

02:07.546 --> 02:10.674
<i>Name's Gillis, Luther.
Private Eye.</i>

02:10.749 --> 02:13.013
<i>I don't work
out of town much anymore.</i>

02:13.085 --> 02:16.680
<i>I mean, there was one recent trip to
Hawaii, but that don't really count.</i>

02:16.989 --> 02:20.083
<i>It was peaches and cream compared
to the one I just wrapped up.</i>

02:20.626 --> 02:24.289
<i>I'm talking about big-city loan
sharking, extortion and racketeering.</i>

02:24.363 --> 02:26.263
<i>And except for one
little loose end...</i>

02:26.331 --> 02:29.698
<i>I was ready to head back to
the office and call it a day.</i>

02:29.768 --> 02:31.429
<i>But I wasn't sure
what was louder...</i>

02:31.503 --> 02:33.494
<i>the sound of my wingtips
on the cobblestone...</i>

02:33.572 --> 02:35.597
<i>or this nagging feeling
in my gut...</i>

02:35.674 --> 02:38.006
<i>that I should've taken care
of that loose end.</i>

02:38.176 --> 02:40.371
<i>But like I said, who cares?</i>

02:40.612 --> 02:43.080
<i>My secretary, Blanche,
and my dumbo nephew, Jack...</i>

02:43.282 --> 02:44.943
<i>wanted me to get back early.</i>

02:45.017 --> 02:46.848
<i>Said they had
a big surprise for me.</i>

02:46.952 --> 02:49.887
<i>And I didn't have the heart
to tell them I hate surprises.</i>

02:49.955 --> 02:51.252
Gillis.

02:53.425 --> 02:56.189
<i>So much for surprises
and loose ends.</i>

03:02.134 --> 03:04.534
Okay, freeze!
No, no.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.632
You're gonna be sorry.

03:13.578 --> 03:16.012
Never, never say "freeze."

03:17.449 --> 03:20.009
The only place you hear
that word is on television.

03:20.085 --> 03:22.246
You're gonna get yourself killed.
Sorry.

03:22.321 --> 03:24.448
Sorry?
You're always sorry.

03:24.723 --> 03:27.749
Here I go, I take you in from
that lousy brother of mine...

03:27.826 --> 03:30.954
I give you a job, despite the
fact you got a college diploma...

03:31.430 --> 03:32.692
and what do you do?

03:32.764 --> 03:33.890
I disappoint you.

03:33.966 --> 03:36.025
And you say "freeze."
I'm sorry.

03:36.702 --> 03:38.693
Can I go to the hospital now?
In a minute.

03:39.938 --> 03:43.305
Now, what's the big surprise
you guys got in store for me?

03:43.408 --> 03:45.433
I'm gonna give you
three guesses.

03:45.811 --> 03:47.301
Can I go to the hospital?

03:47.379 --> 03:49.847
Someone died, someone got born,
someone got married.

03:49.915 --> 03:52.349
Who cares? Whatever.
What's it say?

03:52.417 --> 03:54.351
That we're gonna go
on a long trip.

03:54.519 --> 03:57.545
Kind of like a vacation,
or a honeymoon.

03:57.622 --> 03:59.681
Blanche, will you quit
talking about Niagara Falls?

03:59.758 --> 04:01.020
If I told you once,
I told you...

04:01.093 --> 04:02.458
We're not going
to Niagara Falls.

04:02.527 --> 04:04.586
It says nothing
about Niagara Falls!

04:04.663 --> 04:05.960
How about a hospital?

04:09.835 --> 04:13.635
It says, that,
"you are cordially invited...

04:13.705 --> 04:16.731
"by the National Academy
of Private lnvestigators..."

04:16.808 --> 04:19.435
"to their 17th
annual convention..."

04:19.543 --> 04:23.503
"to receive
a Golden Keyhole Award..."

04:23.582 --> 04:26.415
"for the best nonfiction
book of the year..."

04:26.485 --> 04:29.818
<i>"You Want To Be A Private Eye?</i>
By Luther H. Gillis."

04:29.888 --> 04:31.082
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

04:32.024 --> 04:35.425
"Personal and Confidential.
Top Secret."

04:35.494 --> 04:36.483
So, don't tell nobody.

04:37.863 --> 04:39.455
No kidding? Me?

04:39.798 --> 04:41.629
No kidding. You.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.825
Says you even got to
make a speech.

04:46.104 --> 04:48.800
So we were gonna take you
out tonight and celebrate.

04:48.874 --> 04:51.638
Jack was gonna wish us
bon voyage and everything.

04:52.811 --> 04:54.039
Boy, this is great!

04:54.813 --> 04:56.610
Never mind, I'll get a cab.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.812
Where's this convention,
Blanche?

05:05.824 --> 05:07.052
<i>Maybe Hawaii isn't...</i>

05:07.125 --> 05:09.025
<i>the most breathtaking
place in the world...</i>

05:09.094 --> 05:11.289
<i>but if it isn't,
I don't know what is.</i>

05:11.363 --> 05:13.831
<i>And even though big-league sports
haven't come our way yet...</i>

05:13.899 --> 05:16.925
<i>we have plenty of big-league
sunsets to keep us going.</i>

05:17.202 --> 05:18.567
<i>I call it home.</i>

05:21.206 --> 05:25.472
<i>And home was where I was looking
forward to being for all of next week.</i>

05:25.610 --> 05:27.669
<i>After a real tough case
on the Big Island...</i>

05:27.746 --> 05:29.873
<i>I was ready
for some quiet R and R.</i>

05:29.948 --> 05:32.508
<i>The only thing was,
my little voice was telling me...</i>

05:32.584 --> 05:35.781
<i>there was some little loose
end I hadn't wrapped up.</i>

05:35.854 --> 05:37.879
<i>If I was listening
carefully enough...</i>

05:37.956 --> 05:39.651
<i>perhaps I would have heard it.</i>

05:40.092 --> 05:42.287
<i>Instead, I was hearing
other music, namely...</i>

05:42.360 --> 05:45.158
<i>a little Tchaikovsky
and a lot of Tolstoy.</i>

05:45.397 --> 05:49.356
<i>Yes, I was finally going to take the
time and get through</i> War and Peace.

05:49.568 --> 05:52.469
<i>Some people make New Year's
resolutions to stop drinking...</i>

05:52.571 --> 05:54.038
<i>or quit kicking their dog.</i>

05:54.106 --> 05:57.564
<i>Me, I was finally going to
conquer Russian romanticism.</i>

05:58.543 --> 05:59.635
Magnum.

06:00.579 --> 06:01.910
I say, Magnum.

06:02.681 --> 06:03.773
Magnum!

06:05.283 --> 06:07.217
Will you take them off?
What?

06:07.285 --> 06:08.877
Will you take them off?

06:08.987 --> 06:10.921
Why are you yelling at me?
I'm not...

06:12.257 --> 06:14.225
Magnum, we must
have a talk at once.

06:14.292 --> 06:16.192
What about?
About this mail.

06:16.561 --> 06:17.585
What about it?

06:17.662 --> 06:20.153
While I appreciate your
retrieving it from the box...

06:20.232 --> 06:23.224
I do not appreciate your
leaving it under the chainsaw...

06:23.301 --> 06:25.861
in the gardener's shed
for the past five days.

06:25.937 --> 06:28.997
That is not where I'm accustomed to
going through the estate correspondence.

06:29.074 --> 06:30.598
Higgins, I can explain.

06:30.675 --> 06:34.611
I knew I could count on hearing that
pathetic little phrase once again.

06:34.679 --> 06:37.273
It is as regular as the
rising and setting of the...

06:37.349 --> 06:39.544
Do you wanna know why or not?
Not.

06:39.918 --> 06:42.944
I just don't want it to happen again,
and it won't happen again.

06:43.021 --> 06:45.489
From now on, it will be
the lads' duty, not yours.

06:46.625 --> 06:48.957
Because of you, the whole
financial pyramid...

06:49.027 --> 06:51.427
that is my managing
of the estate economy...

06:51.496 --> 06:56.058
could come crashing down into a
depression that would rival that of '29.

06:56.168 --> 06:57.692
Liens, foreclosures.

06:59.905 --> 07:01.065
Oh, my God.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.641
A wedding, a birth, a death.

07:09.047 --> 07:13.074
I'm sorry, Magnum,
this apparently is addressed to you.

07:13.885 --> 07:15.045
That's my mail?

07:15.120 --> 07:19.887
"You are cordially invited by the National
Academy of Private lnvestigators..."

07:20.926 --> 07:25.488
"to their 17th annual convention
to present a Golden Keyhole Award."

07:26.898 --> 07:28.297
How droll.

07:28.700 --> 07:31.965
"The Mauka Room
of the Kalanianaole Hotel.

07:32.237 --> 07:35.400
"Top Secret. Personal and Confidential."
Higgins, give me my mail.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.837
By the by, Magnum,
do they tell you what the password is?

07:39.344 --> 07:41.244
All right, Higgins, enough.

07:41.346 --> 07:43.507
I mean, who would wanna go
to this silly thing anyway?

07:43.582 --> 07:45.550
It's probably just a...
Mistake.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.911
This telegram is obviously
a follow-up explaining that.

07:47.986 --> 07:50.181
All some terrible
misunderstanding.

07:51.122 --> 07:53.682
After all, how could
they possibly want you?

08:16.481 --> 08:18.449
Aloha!

08:19.684 --> 08:21.549
It's okay.
You say you didn't get...

08:21.620 --> 08:24.248
the telegram till now?
No harm done, I believe you.

08:24.322 --> 08:26.813
Just tell us where you want us to
wait till you get our rooms ready.

08:26.891 --> 08:28.017
Calcutta.

08:29.928 --> 08:31.122
Luther.

08:31.229 --> 08:34.221
Luther, they said we couldn't stay here.
Of course we can stay here.

08:34.299 --> 08:37.700
I mean when a guy I worked with,
lay my keister on the line for...

08:37.769 --> 08:40.863
takes me to the airport, buys me some
macadamia nuts, puts me on a plane...

08:40.938 --> 08:43.066
Luther.
And tells me with a straight face...

08:43.140 --> 08:45.109
the next time I'm in Hawaii
to look him up...

08:45.176 --> 08:48.111
I'm talking about Tom 'You can
come stay with me, pal' Magnum.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.579
I never said that!
It doesn't matter.

08:50.649 --> 08:52.844
I gave this address to the convention,
we have to stay here.

08:52.917 --> 08:54.111
I'm afraid that's impossible.

08:54.185 --> 08:57.621
You see, Mr. Masters is expecting
the entire stewardess contingent...

08:57.689 --> 09:02.251
of TransGlobal Airways flights 276
and 512 to be staying here next week.

09:02.327 --> 09:04.022
That's okay.
They won't bother us.

09:04.095 --> 09:08.395
That's not the point.
The point is you are not staying here.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.898
Wait, wait.
I got to get this right.

09:11.069 --> 09:14.300
I come all the way to Hawaii to get
the biggest award of my career...

09:14.372 --> 09:17.830
"Top Secret," they tell me. "Confidential."
Just let us know where you're staying...

09:17.909 --> 09:19.604
"We'll contact you," they say.

09:19.678 --> 09:22.841
So, I give them the address of
the only friend I have in Hawaii.

09:22.914 --> 09:25.007
And this friend is telling me
I'm not staying here?

09:25.083 --> 09:28.143
We'll get you another room.
We'll call them up...

09:30.889 --> 09:33.380
And what will Jack...
Shut up! All of you!

09:34.492 --> 09:37.655
Now, there isn't any reason for all
of this screaming and hollering.

09:37.729 --> 09:39.253
These things happen.

09:39.331 --> 09:41.231
Me and Luther can go to a hotel.

09:42.167 --> 09:43.532
Separate rooms, of course.

09:43.601 --> 09:46.798
Oh, good. Good.
I'll take you both over to the hotel...

09:46.871 --> 09:49.271
get the rooms,
and then we can go to the convention...

09:49.341 --> 09:51.309
and let them know
where to find you.

09:51.376 --> 09:52.536
You boys just go along.

09:52.610 --> 09:55.238
I'm gonna stay here and cook up
a little something special...

09:55.313 --> 09:56.974
for just the four of us.

09:57.048 --> 09:58.447
That really isn't necessary.

09:59.050 --> 10:02.747
No, sure, don't worry, I'm gonna have
it ready by the time they get back.

10:03.722 --> 10:05.349
Smoked kielbasa...

10:05.423 --> 10:08.950
direct from Khartousian's Deli,
East 63rd.

10:09.027 --> 10:11.393
My specialty.
Where's the pots and pans?

10:12.664 --> 10:13.790
In the kitchen.

10:16.101 --> 10:18.501
Hadn't you better start
checking on those rooms?

10:19.437 --> 10:21.598
Why can't you stay
with your daughter Nancy?

10:21.673 --> 10:24.642
I'd love to, but she's in a
boarding school, in Detroit.

10:24.743 --> 10:27.177
Chicago.
It's Tim that's in Detroit.

10:27.245 --> 10:28.803
Whatever. What are we
waiting for?

10:28.880 --> 10:31.144
Let's get to the convention
and check out some of the guys.

10:31.216 --> 10:33.878
And find another room.
Yeah, ain't we got fun!

10:39.290 --> 10:41.758
 Do svidaniya
<i>to Russian romanticism.</i>

10:41.959 --> 10:44.223
<i>The closest I'd probably
get to it now would be...</i>

10:44.295 --> 10:46.763
<i>the Russian dressing
on the chicken sandwiches...</i>

10:46.931 --> 10:49.365
<i>at the closing banquet
Wednesday night.</i>

10:49.467 --> 10:52.698
<i>Somehow, my appetite for all
this wasn't quite whetted.</i>

10:55.707 --> 10:58.107
Excuse me. Says on
the invitation here...

10:58.176 --> 11:01.043
we're supposed to get in touch
with a guy named Lloyd DeWitt.

11:01.112 --> 11:02.773
He's the local secretary.

11:03.548 --> 11:04.606
You know him?

11:05.016 --> 11:06.984
I've bumped into him
a couple of times.

11:07.051 --> 11:09.611
Bourbon on the rocks and
hold the flowers, please.

11:09.687 --> 11:12.087
 That's him over there.

11:12.390 --> 11:13.516
Who?

11:13.925 --> 11:15.187
Lloyd Dewitt.

11:16.027 --> 11:18.222
You mean that guy
with the food on his shirt?

11:19.030 --> 11:20.122
Yeah.

11:20.565 --> 11:21.691
That's class.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.233
Well, he sells hotdogs
on the North Shore.

11:25.536 --> 11:27.333
Really? Could've fooled me.

11:27.638 --> 11:31.130
Being a Pl must be just a sideline,
like most of you guys out here.

11:32.543 --> 11:33.976
You must be Luther Gillis.

11:34.679 --> 11:37.409
You're late.
I didn't expect you to turn up at all.

11:37.482 --> 11:39.950
Are you kidding, DeWitt?
And miss my award?

11:40.017 --> 11:41.746
This here's an old pal
of mine, Tom Magnum.

11:41.819 --> 11:42.877
Hi.
Hi.

11:42.954 --> 11:45.252
He was along for the ride when
I put Artie Canoe behind bars.

11:45.323 --> 11:47.188
Keanu. Artie Keanu.

11:47.258 --> 11:48.623
How is that crud, anyway?

11:48.693 --> 11:51.526
Keanu? He escaped
from prison three weeks ago.

11:51.596 --> 11:53.359
Great! We can nail him again!

11:53.431 --> 11:56.229
No, no. We are not
going to nail anybody.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.995
The police are going to
nail him again.

11:58.069 --> 12:00.902
We are going to get you a room
so that you can get your award...

12:00.972 --> 12:04.430
and then we, Luther, we are going
to get you back to St. Louis.

12:04.509 --> 12:07.103
Yeah, but I thought you
could... But nothing.

12:07.812 --> 12:09.177
No Artie Keanu.

12:10.948 --> 12:14.008
Don't worry about it, he's gonna
be captured. And when he is...

12:14.085 --> 12:17.020
I'm sure it will have something to
do with computers and electronics.

12:17.088 --> 12:18.783
Computers are for sissies.

12:19.190 --> 12:21.249
Luther.
Oh, really?

12:21.325 --> 12:24.089
Well, let me tell you that
computers and electronics...

12:24.162 --> 12:26.630
are the wave of the future
in this industry.

12:27.064 --> 12:31.398
Foot-tails and stakeouts will
become as obsolete as Panama hats...

12:31.502 --> 12:34.130
and the ubiquitous informants
on the street.

12:34.839 --> 12:38.104
Be ready for the future,
or you'll wind up in the past.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.172
Who said that?
I did.

12:40.645 --> 12:42.237
It's in my book:

12:42.313 --> 12:44.747
<i>Private Investigative Techniques
In the Computer Age...</i>

12:44.816 --> 12:46.943
subtitled <i>Software and You.</i>

12:47.018 --> 12:49.248
You can pick one up
in the lobby for <i>$</i> 7.95.

12:49.320 --> 12:50.981
Yeah, well,
that's very interesting...

12:51.055 --> 12:53.819
Sounds great.
You're quite an entrepreneur.

12:54.392 --> 12:55.484
Onions extra?

13:02.099 --> 13:03.327
I'm sorry.

13:07.038 --> 13:08.596
Hey, go ahead, laugh it up.

13:08.673 --> 13:12.302
But computers have
revolutionized my business.

13:12.777 --> 13:15.371
Really? You can't eat
a computer at a ballgame.

13:16.314 --> 13:19.374
But, hey, save some of your
shirt for me for later.

13:19.917 --> 13:20.975
I might get hungry.

13:23.654 --> 13:25.519
Yes, I'm still here.

13:25.723 --> 13:27.122
That's great!

13:28.826 --> 13:31.659
Gillis. G-l-L-L-l-S.

13:32.330 --> 13:33.797
Right. Right.

13:33.865 --> 13:36.595
6:00? They'll be there.

13:37.034 --> 13:39.867
Oh, and thank you
very, very much.

13:40.271 --> 13:41.363
Thank you.

13:45.543 --> 13:47.408
Blackie, you are a con.

13:47.478 --> 13:50.345
You remember the time when you
and me and Frankie Albright...

13:50.414 --> 13:53.679
busted up that Greek Olive
smuggling ring in the...

13:53.751 --> 13:57.414
Hey, Tom, I want you to meet some
buddies of mine from the old days.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.752
This is Rudy G,
Nick The Stick, and Blackie.

13:59.824 --> 14:01.052
Glad to meet you, pal.

14:01.125 --> 14:04.686
Hi, guys. Luther, I got the room.
Let's go get Blanche.

14:04.829 --> 14:06.421
Hey, we just got here.

14:06.631 --> 14:09.031
Me and the boys have got
some memories to catch up on.

14:09.100 --> 14:13.366
You know, Tom was with me and helped me
bust up that Artie Canoe guy a while back.

14:13.437 --> 14:16.531
Yeah, it reminded me of the
time when I was back in Keokuk.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.199
There were these
bohemian used cars...

14:18.276 --> 14:20.073
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

14:20.144 --> 14:22.806
<i>You're thinking I spent the
whole day at the convention...</i>

14:22.880 --> 14:24.279
<i>bored out of my mind.</i>

14:24.582 --> 14:26.447
<i>Well, this time you're wrong.</i>

14:26.918 --> 14:29.318
<i>You see, after my
initial reluctance...</i>

14:29.387 --> 14:34.188
<i>I found the boys, Blackie, Nick The
Stick and Rudy G, quite interesting.</i>

14:34.325 --> 14:35.883
<i>Their stories were bizarre...</i>

14:35.960 --> 14:39.623
<i>but it was kind of neat to hear about
the good old days. I was fascinated.</i>

14:39.697 --> 14:42.131
<i>It was kind of like
being in a Sam Spade movie.</i>

14:42.400 --> 14:45.927
Boy, those guys are the most boring
bunch of liars I've ever heard.

14:46.003 --> 14:47.868
I couldn't wait
to blow that joint.

14:55.346 --> 14:57.075
Blanche could never
cook that stuff.

14:57.148 --> 14:59.378
Higgins! Higgins!

15:11.028 --> 15:12.859
Hey! They're not here!

15:12.964 --> 15:15.057
There's a good reason for that.
What?

15:15.299 --> 15:17.233
This note says
they've been kidnapped.

15:24.066 --> 15:26.057
<i>The shock of having
someone close to you...</i>

15:26.127 --> 15:28.687
<i>suddenly and inexplicably
yanked away...</i>

15:28.762 --> 15:30.753
<i>was a brutal reminder
of how fragile...</i>

15:30.831 --> 15:32.298
<i>human relationships can be.</i>

15:33.000 --> 15:35.093
<i>Of course, we were both
too professional...</i>

15:35.169 --> 15:38.332
<i>to let that affect our realistic
assessment of the facts.</i>

15:38.506 --> 15:41.373
I know what happened.
It's as clear as the nose on my face.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.839
The butler got Blanche drunk,
seduced her...

15:44.945 --> 15:47.914
wrote this phony kidnap note,
and then ran off with her.

15:47.982 --> 15:51.179
Why would Blanche run off with
Higgins, Luther, when she's got you?

15:52.186 --> 15:53.551
Yeah, you're right.

15:55.990 --> 15:57.890
Artie Keanu.
What?

15:57.992 --> 16:01.120
Artie Keanu. He wants revenge
for us putting him away.

16:01.195 --> 16:03.356
So he takes Higgins and Blanche.

16:03.497 --> 16:04.725
That makes sense.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.661
Why didn't he say that
on the note?

16:07.735 --> 16:11.227
It doesn't say anything in the note.
It just says, "Wait for instructions."

16:12.706 --> 16:14.537
It looks like
they're coming around.

16:15.376 --> 16:17.469
Big deal. They're not gonna
tell us anything.

16:17.545 --> 16:19.376
Luther,
this is no time for jokes!

16:19.446 --> 16:21.937
I'm not joking.
I wanna get Artie Canoe. So do I!

16:22.016 --> 16:24.211
Well, this is your turf,
your burg. Where do we start?

16:26.387 --> 16:29.481
You have got a strange way of
getting information out here.

16:29.557 --> 16:31.548
Whatever happened to grabbing
the bum by the collar...

16:31.625 --> 16:32.751
and shaking it out of him?

16:32.826 --> 16:35.659
You don't shake someone down
like lce Pick.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.754
No, you play tennis with him.
What a place.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.797
Great return,
lce Pick. Your point.

16:41.869 --> 16:43.200
What are you talking about?

16:43.270 --> 16:45.761
T.C. Oh, yeah.
Great return, lce Pick.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.329
Sorry,
what were you saying, Luther?

16:47.474 --> 16:49.442
I was saying, you don't
play tennis with someone...

16:49.510 --> 16:51.671
to get information.
You shake it out of him.

16:56.717 --> 16:57.809
Thomas.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.544
Big Sally.

17:00.621 --> 17:03.784
I'm not interested in your love life.
What did he tell you?

17:03.857 --> 17:05.790
Big Sally happens to be
Artie's wife.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.723
Ice Pick thinks that maybe
she's hiding him out.

17:07.795 --> 17:09.558
Where?
Come on, Orville.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.130
You know, if he...

17:17.204 --> 17:21.071
if he so much as touches one hair
on her head, I'm gonna kill him.

17:22.009 --> 17:24.772
He won't, Luther.
Artie Keanu wants us.

17:24.845 --> 17:27.040
Yeah, well, that's what
he's gonna get. Us.

17:27.381 --> 17:30.908
You know, me and Blanche,
we've been together a pretty long time.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.079
We...

17:33.153 --> 17:37.112
Well, what I mean is, I'd have to run
an ad, get a young chick, train her.

17:37.191 --> 17:38.419
You know what I mean?

17:39.460 --> 17:40.586
I think so.

17:42.396 --> 17:44.762
I'll get that.
Nice serve, lce Pick!

17:50.571 --> 17:51.629
Big Sally.

17:51.705 --> 17:54.196
We know. She's married
to Artie Canoe. Where is she?

17:54.275 --> 17:56.709
They've got a place
at Malu Beach.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.237
Hey!
We playing here, or what?

18:01.382 --> 18:02.940
That's all I need to know.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.849
Wait a minute, Luther!

18:05.052 --> 18:07.714
We need some more information.
We don't even know they're there!

18:07.788 --> 18:09.688
Will you just wait?
You just wait.

18:09.757 --> 18:11.315
Luther Gillis is on the move.

18:15.029 --> 18:16.189
Shh!

18:16.897 --> 18:17.989
Sorry.

18:18.699 --> 18:20.826
I forgot my loincloth and spear.

18:20.901 --> 18:22.391
Will you just keep quiet?

18:24.104 --> 18:27.073
All right. Here's what I
think we ought to do first.

18:27.141 --> 18:28.699
Save the strategy
for the dominoes.

18:28.776 --> 18:30.607
You bust in the front door,
I'll go in the back.

18:30.678 --> 18:33.374
Luther, we don't even
know they're in there. So?

18:33.447 --> 18:36.245
So, we have been
all through this before.

18:36.317 --> 18:38.547
There's no reason to
go in there guns blazing.

18:38.619 --> 18:41.452
All right, all right.
Synchronize our watches.

18:42.056 --> 18:44.616
What? Put the big hand on six,
big guy.

18:45.659 --> 18:48.423
I give you three minutes.
You bust in the front door.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.092
Luther!

19:00.874 --> 19:02.739
<i>One of the tougher
things about being...</i>

19:02.810 --> 19:05.677
<i>a Private Investigator was
doing what I was doing now.</i>

19:05.946 --> 19:08.744
<i>Going into a potentially
dangerous situation...</i>

19:08.816 --> 19:11.876
<i>without really knowing what
form the danger would take.</i>

19:12.286 --> 19:13.583
<i>Or from whom.</i>

19:13.887 --> 19:15.548
<i>But when the stakes are high...</i>

19:15.622 --> 19:19.388
<i>you sometimes have to gamble
and hope for the best.</i>

19:19.626 --> 19:22.891
<i>And above all,
remain cool and calm.</i>

19:25.199 --> 19:27.963
<i>My head was spinning
like the carousel at Coney...</i>

19:28.535 --> 19:31.470
<i>and my heart was pounding
like Gene Krupa at the Copa.</i>

19:31.672 --> 19:33.503
<i>But like I said, who cares?</i>

19:33.574 --> 19:36.600
<i>These cruds had Blanche and I
didn't care what else they had.</i>

19:37.144 --> 19:41.171
<i>Guns, knives, cannons, B-17's,
I was ready for anything.</i>

19:43.884 --> 19:46.375
That's what you get
for sneaking around my house.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.318
You get up
and I'll hit you again.

19:53.744 --> 19:54.938
Put down the pan.

19:57.381 --> 19:58.678
Please, please.

19:59.650 --> 20:02.118
You guys touch me,
you'll be history.

20:02.185 --> 20:06.121
Don't worry, lady, the only thing that's
gonna touch you is a 10-foot pole.

20:06.189 --> 20:08.384
Luther!
Where's Artie Canoe?

20:08.959 --> 20:11.052
I don't have
to listen to that creep.

20:11.128 --> 20:14.655
You guys can rob me, beat me,
kill me, whatever...

20:14.731 --> 20:16.858
but I don't have to
listen to him.

20:17.267 --> 20:18.996
Listen, I know how you feel.

20:19.169 --> 20:21.797
Would you mind telling me
where I might find Artie?

20:21.872 --> 20:24.238
I don't mind at all,
if I knew myself.

20:25.142 --> 20:27.906
What you guys want
with the ugly ape? You cops?

20:27.978 --> 20:30.572
Well, actually, we're private
investigators and we think that...

20:30.647 --> 20:31.841
Artie may be responsible...

20:32.983 --> 20:34.780
He ain't responsible
for nothing.

20:34.851 --> 20:38.082
The jerk escapes from prison,
does he give me a call?

20:38.321 --> 20:39.879
Does he send me any bread?

20:39.956 --> 20:42.891
Does he let me know
he's okay? No, nothing.

20:43.293 --> 20:44.954
So, what you want with him?

20:45.028 --> 20:48.828
Well, we think he was involved in a
kidnapping of two friends of ours.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.196
Look, can you help us?

20:51.768 --> 20:52.860
I don't know.

20:53.370 --> 20:57.238
<i>*</i> You always hurt
the one you love <i>*</i>

20:58.542 --> 21:01.636
<i>*</i> The one you shouldn't
hurt at all <i>*</i>

21:02.112 --> 21:04.512
No, wait! No, no,
he can't hear you. No.

21:06.049 --> 21:08.574
Try the Celestial Mission
on Hotel Street.

21:08.652 --> 21:10.677
Friend of his named Jo runs it.

21:10.954 --> 21:13.445
If anybody'll know, it'll be Jo.

21:13.523 --> 21:15.787
<i>*</i> You always break
the kindest heart <i>*</i>

21:15.859 --> 21:18.555
Right, well, thank you,
I'll just get him out of here.

21:18.628 --> 21:22.428
<i>*</i> With a hasty word
you can't recall <i>*</i>

21:22.499 --> 21:24.330
Come on, Luther. Here we go.

21:24.534 --> 21:29.267
<i>*</i> So if I broke
your heart last night <i>*</i>

21:30.040 --> 21:34.340
<i>*</i> It's because
I love you most of all <i>**</i>

21:37.881 --> 21:39.610
What'd she say?
What'd she say?

21:39.683 --> 21:40.843
Nothing.

21:40.917 --> 21:42.748
Come on, come on,
what'd she tell you?

21:42.819 --> 21:46.152
Nothing, Luther!
She wasn't very helpful.

21:46.423 --> 21:47.890
And neither were you.

21:48.024 --> 21:50.424
What about synchronizing our watches?
You jumped the gun.

21:50.494 --> 21:51.961
Details. Details.

21:52.295 --> 21:55.059
Just 'cause I shot my mouth off a
little bit, she whacked me out...

21:55.132 --> 21:58.329
doesn't mean... Doesn't mean you
should withhold anything she said.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.528
I'm not withholding anything,
Luther.

22:00.604 --> 22:04.768
I'm just gonna drop you off at Doc
lbold's so you can get your head examined.

22:04.841 --> 22:06.536
And then I'm gonna go
back to the estate...

22:06.610 --> 22:08.669
and see if there's any
messages from the kidnappers.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.474
And then I'll pick you up, okay?

22:11.314 --> 22:13.544
Look, I'm not the one
who made her mad.

22:16.019 --> 22:17.816
Thanks. Thanks, Chuckie.

22:20.323 --> 22:22.553
I was just wondering
how Blanche is doing.

22:26.897 --> 22:28.694
Some honeymoon, huh?

22:29.032 --> 22:31.296
Only part that's romantic
about this is...

22:31.368 --> 22:34.963
I'm locked up in a secluded
shack with a guy on the beach.

22:35.806 --> 22:38.001
Only thing is,
it's the wrong guy.

22:38.475 --> 22:40.306
I'm quite sorry
to disappoint you.

22:40.510 --> 22:43.877
I can assure you this is not my
idea of idyllic bliss, either.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.074
In fact, your presence here,
my dear woman...

22:46.216 --> 22:48.207
acutely exacerbates
the situation.

22:48.418 --> 22:49.544
Uh-uh.

22:49.753 --> 22:53.052
You think you're gonna get
someplace with me using flattery?

22:55.192 --> 22:56.318
No way.

22:57.027 --> 23:01.293
Hey, are you some kind
of a duke or something?

23:02.232 --> 23:04.462
Maybe a count?
Miss Rafferty...

23:04.935 --> 23:06.163
Blanche.

23:06.236 --> 23:10.673
Miss Rafferty, although the Higgins
lineage is decidedly distinguished...

23:10.740 --> 23:12.105
it is not of the realm.

23:12.709 --> 23:16.110
I guess you're not being held
here on account of for your bread.

23:16.847 --> 23:20.112
Miss Rafferty, I'm quite sure that
the reason we're being held here...

23:20.183 --> 23:22.913
can be directly attributed to
the presence of your fiancé...

23:22.986 --> 23:24.317
I wish.
Luther Gillis...

23:24.387 --> 23:26.821
that walking anachronism,
here on this island.

23:26.990 --> 23:30.323
And all this time Luther thought
that you didn't like him.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.985
And here you are
complimenting him.

23:33.363 --> 23:34.762
What a guy.

23:36.099 --> 23:39.865
Nevertheless, Mr. Higgins,
I think that you're making a mistake.

23:39.936 --> 23:41.597
We're here on account of Magnum.

23:41.705 --> 23:43.673
He must've done something
to make somebody mad.

23:43.740 --> 23:46.300
Your hypothesis is not beyond
the realm of possibility.

23:46.376 --> 23:48.503
All right,
so sometimes I'm wrong.

23:49.012 --> 23:50.673
We still got to
get out of this mess.

23:55.919 --> 23:57.181
Like one time...

23:57.787 --> 24:01.086
I remember this time when
Luther, Chuckie and me...

24:01.391 --> 24:03.586
Chuckie. Chuckie was
Luther's ex-partner.

24:03.660 --> 24:07.756
He got snuffed in San Jose,
'53, outside of a dance hall.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.900
What am I talking about?

24:12.102 --> 24:13.694
Sometimes I ramble.

24:14.804 --> 24:15.896
Anyway...

24:16.139 --> 24:18.266
Chuckie and me
was being held prisoner...

24:18.341 --> 24:20.901
by Moe Safronsky and his gang...

24:21.211 --> 24:23.179
in this cabin in the Catskills.

24:23.413 --> 24:27.873
See, these hotel comedians,
they was being bumped off one by one...

24:27.984 --> 24:31.613
Please, Miss Rafferty, I fail to see
how some sordid tale from the past...

24:31.688 --> 24:34.020
can have any relevance
to our current plight.

24:36.059 --> 24:38.653
Now, you happen to have
a hairpin on you?

24:38.728 --> 24:40.025
Yeah, sure.

24:41.298 --> 24:42.560
You look okay.

24:46.269 --> 24:50.103
I shall attempt to remove the hairpin
from your hair with my teeth...

24:50.607 --> 24:53.303
and use it
to try to undo our bonds.

24:53.777 --> 24:56.610
It may take some time and effort,
but it will be worth it.

24:56.813 --> 24:59.373
Not unlike the time that I was
imprisoned with Bertie Farnbush...

24:59.449 --> 25:02.680
and his maiden sister in an
Albanian zipper factory by...

25:02.752 --> 25:05.880
Hey, hey. Would you just
spare me the...

25:06.122 --> 25:08.522
"sordid tales of your past"?

25:08.725 --> 25:11.523
And, let's just get
the hell out of here, huh?

25:11.861 --> 25:14.557
Would you kindly lean toward me.

25:22.038 --> 25:24.666
<i>More on "potentially
dangerous situations."</i>

25:24.741 --> 25:27.642
<i>Even though I realized it was risky
coming down to Hotel Street...</i>

25:27.711 --> 25:29.542
<i>and looking for
Artie Keanu alone...</i>

25:29.612 --> 25:33.571
<i>I realized the alternative,
coming down here with Luther...</i>

25:33.650 --> 25:35.049
<i>was worse.</i>

25:35.118 --> 25:39.885
<i>So I left him with Doc Ibold and a fervent
request that he be heavily sedated.</i>

25:40.056 --> 25:42.718
<i>Preferably for the next
six or seven years.</i>

25:46.863 --> 25:48.125
Hi there.

25:49.566 --> 25:50.726
Jo around?

26:02.212 --> 26:03.474
Bye-bye, baby.

26:20.330 --> 26:21.558
Hi.

26:25.635 --> 26:26.761
Is Jo around?

26:27.404 --> 26:30.498
I'm Jo. And I'm around.

26:31.975 --> 26:33.602
But you can take your pick.

26:33.676 --> 26:37.544
No. Well, I mean, you don't understand.
Big Sally sent me.

26:39.082 --> 26:40.743
Who?
Big Sally.

26:41.017 --> 26:42.245
Artie's old lady.

26:43.553 --> 26:45.544
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

26:45.622 --> 26:47.988
Artie Canoe, Keanu.
I have to see him.

26:48.858 --> 26:50.951
Listen, mister...
I understand.

26:51.027 --> 26:53.257
I didn't wanna come here all
the way from Seattle, either...

26:53.329 --> 26:56.389
but when Big Sally called me and
told me that Artie was in this fix...

26:56.466 --> 26:59.663
I think you better turn around
and walk right back out that door.

27:02.972 --> 27:04.599
No Artie?
Get.

27:06.242 --> 27:09.439
Right. Well, it was nice
meeting you ladies.

27:09.512 --> 27:10.843
Nice meeting
you, too. Bye-bye.

27:10.914 --> 27:12.074
Thanks anyway.

27:12.148 --> 27:13.877
Come again.
Good night.

27:13.950 --> 27:16.475
<i>Big Sally had
obviously set us up.</i>

27:16.553 --> 27:19.044
<i>But, at least as far as
the danger aspect went...</i>

27:19.122 --> 27:21.181
<i>my fears had proved
to be unfounded.</i>

27:21.257 --> 27:23.191
<i>I was getting out of here
in one piece.</i>

27:23.259 --> 27:24.521
Artie Canoe. Where is he?

27:24.594 --> 27:26.789
Tell me or I'll rip
the lips off your face!

27:26.996 --> 27:28.827
I'll peel the scar
off your cheek.

27:29.265 --> 27:31.733
Come on, Luther,
he's not even here. What?

27:34.237 --> 27:35.761
What'd you do that for?

27:39.242 --> 27:40.368
Come on, Luther.

27:49.419 --> 27:51.353
Ain't this great?
No!

27:55.625 --> 27:57.650
What is going on in here?

27:57.727 --> 27:59.126
Stop it!
Stop it right now!

28:00.230 --> 28:01.629
Get him, girls!

28:02.165 --> 28:03.393
Put her down!

28:12.175 --> 28:13.233
Harder, harder!

28:16.446 --> 28:19.472
All right,
hold it! Everybody!

28:19.549 --> 28:21.176
You're all under arrest.

28:21.851 --> 28:23.478
Hi, Frank.

28:34.222 --> 28:36.315
The slammer,
the big house, the hoosegow...

28:36.399 --> 28:38.697
I know all the names,
they don't scare me.

28:38.768 --> 28:41.601
They haven't built a joint big enough
to hold Luther Gillis for long.

28:41.671 --> 28:43.036
Shut up!

28:43.306 --> 28:46.673
What's the matter,
the place getting to you? No, you are!

28:46.910 --> 28:49.606
Do you have to fill every
silence with endless chatter?

28:49.679 --> 28:51.579
Can't you be quiet
for just one minute?

28:51.648 --> 28:53.172
You drive everyone
around you crazy!

28:53.249 --> 28:55.183
No, I don't!
Yes, you do!

28:56.486 --> 28:59.512
The last time you were here some
poor guy tried to hang himself...

28:59.589 --> 29:01.181
because you wouldn't shut up!

29:01.257 --> 29:02.747
Oh, yeah, Scrungo.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.088
Wonder whatever happened to him.

29:05.929 --> 29:07.829
Now all we got
are these creepos.

29:08.398 --> 29:09.524
Luther.

29:09.599 --> 29:11.089
You lousy bums.

29:11.468 --> 29:12.765
He didn't mean it.

29:12.836 --> 29:14.030
To hell with them.

29:14.104 --> 29:16.971
It hadn't been for them, we'd have
been on to Blanche and Higgins now.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.735
Not them. You!

29:19.609 --> 29:20.906
What are you talking about?

29:20.977 --> 29:22.342
I'm talking about...

29:22.412 --> 29:24.380
how you always go
into a situation...

29:24.481 --> 29:27.041
like you're James Cagney or
Humphrey Bogart or somebody...

29:27.117 --> 29:29.381
without any regard
for the consequences.

29:29.719 --> 29:31.016
Didn't hurt them any.

29:33.389 --> 29:35.516
Those were movies, Luther.

29:35.658 --> 29:38.456
This is real.
Big Sally set us up.

29:38.528 --> 29:40.018
Now, if you would have
stayed put...

29:40.096 --> 29:42.963
I could have found that out
without us having to go to jail.

29:43.032 --> 29:44.693
Don't you ever stop to think?

29:45.935 --> 29:47.300
Yeah, I stop and think.

29:47.670 --> 29:49.501
I stop and think that Blanche...

29:49.572 --> 29:51.437
the lady that's been
with me all these years...

29:51.508 --> 29:54.568
when I been coming in like Cagney
and Bogart, might be dead now...

29:54.644 --> 29:55.770
'cause of me.

29:56.179 --> 29:58.044
That's what I've been
thinking about.

29:58.181 --> 30:01.344
And that's why I'm gonna stop
at nothing till I find her.

30:01.885 --> 30:03.477
So, no more
of that funny business...

30:03.553 --> 30:06.021
like getting that doc
to fill me up with dope.

30:06.089 --> 30:07.215
Okay?

30:07.457 --> 30:11.052
Now, we're either working this one
together, or we're not working at all.

30:11.394 --> 30:12.622
What do you say?

30:15.498 --> 30:16.590
Okay.

30:19.002 --> 30:22.233
So, where are your buddies that are
gonna spring us from this joint?

30:23.072 --> 30:25.939
Wait a minute.
Where's Doc lbold?

30:26.009 --> 30:28.239
How did you know
to get to Hotel Street?

30:28.511 --> 30:31.674
Let's just say that Sawbones
got a taste of his own medicine.

30:32.282 --> 30:33.544
You know what I mean?

30:33.950 --> 30:37.477
And if you wanna know how I figured
out how to follow you to Jo's...

30:37.554 --> 30:40.387
well, you'll just have to wait
till my next book comes out.

30:41.291 --> 30:42.758
So, where are your friends?

30:58.074 --> 31:00.269
Hey, Scrungo.
How's it going?

31:07.250 --> 31:10.344
Hey, Scrungo. I say,
how's it going? Hi.

31:16.359 --> 31:17.883
Put me in with those guys.

31:24.701 --> 31:26.362
<i>$</i> 50,000.

31:26.436 --> 31:29.633
Where's Thomas gonna get that kind
of money by 3:00 in the morning?

31:29.739 --> 31:33.038
Hopefully from the same place
he's gonna pay this lOU.

31:33.309 --> 31:34.867
You talk about favors...

31:34.944 --> 31:36.434
You know, this is
just like the movies.

31:36.512 --> 31:38.912
Come alone. No cops.
A secluded beach.

31:39.349 --> 31:42.341
Well, I still think he should
call the cops. No. No cops.

31:42.418 --> 31:44.477
That was Robin's attorney.
He's wiring the money.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.488
You mean Robin's gonna pay
<i>$</i> 50,000 for Higgins?

31:46.556 --> 31:49.024
He would. But we're not gonna pay it.
I have a plan.

31:49.092 --> 31:50.616
Wait a minute. Luther.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.060
Oh, he's up feeding the dogs.

31:53.596 --> 31:56.565
Yeah? Well, he's been feeding
the lads for the last half hour.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.970
I believed him.
This time I really believed him.

32:07.043 --> 32:08.237
Where do you think he is?

32:09.412 --> 32:11.642
<i>I was right on
top of the situation.</i>

32:11.714 --> 32:13.682
<i>Luther H. Gillis
was on the move.</i>

32:14.150 --> 32:16.983
<i>And this time I was gonna get
the truth out of Big Sally...</i>

32:17.053 --> 32:19.749
<i>about where Artie Canoe was,
if it killed her.</i>

32:24.527 --> 32:26.324
<i>That's why I ditched
the big guy.</i>

32:27.196 --> 32:30.131
<i>I just don't think he has the
stomach for the rough stuff.</i>

32:45.481 --> 32:47.449
You?
Yeah, it's me.

32:47.850 --> 32:49.841
You're going to be sorry
you did that.

32:49.919 --> 32:53.286
I'll save it for confession.
Right now, it's your turn, fatso.

32:53.356 --> 32:54.687
Where's Artie Canoe?

32:54.957 --> 32:56.254
That's Keanu.

32:56.326 --> 32:57.793
Whatever. Who cares?

33:01.431 --> 33:02.921
Luther Gillis.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.390
I owe you one.

33:05.835 --> 33:09.771
Well, let me have Blanche and the
butler guy and we'll call it even.

33:10.039 --> 33:12.940
I'm gonna kill you,
then we'll call it even.

33:13.376 --> 33:14.707
How about just Blanche?

33:14.777 --> 33:16.802
I don't know what you're
talking about, Gillis.

33:16.879 --> 33:18.710
All I know is you're history.

33:19.215 --> 33:22.309
The only thing I'm sorry about
is your partner ain't here also.

33:23.553 --> 33:24.815
Hi, guy.

33:27.557 --> 33:28.922
Where's Higgins?

33:29.092 --> 33:32.084
Come on. I don't know what
you guys are talking about.

33:32.362 --> 33:33.761
That's not good enough, Artie.

33:34.330 --> 33:37.128
Let me tell you what's gonna
happen if after I count to three...

33:37.200 --> 33:39.566
you don't tell me where
Blanche and Higgins are.

33:39.635 --> 33:42.297
Luther's gonna hit Big Sally over
the head with the frying pan...

33:42.372 --> 33:43.771
you're gonna shoot Luther...

33:43.840 --> 33:45.068
and then I'm gonna shoot you.

33:45.208 --> 33:47.802
Then I'm
going to shoot you, mister.

33:48.478 --> 33:50.673
No, no, no.
See, I didn't finish.

33:51.414 --> 33:54.247
Then you're gonna shoot me
and they're gonna shoot you.

33:55.318 --> 33:56.808
Who?
Them.

34:06.262 --> 34:08.230
Okay, Artie, where are they?

34:08.898 --> 34:09.989
Who?

34:10.766 --> 34:12.257
Blanche and the butler!

34:12.467 --> 34:14.458
I don't know
who you're talking about.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.407
You know, me, Luther,
and Chuckie...

34:23.478 --> 34:26.243
used to work out of this
five-story walkup on East 11th.

34:26.616 --> 34:28.413
Boy, those were the days.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.882
Now, they got an elevator
in that place and everything.

34:32.054 --> 34:33.179
How're you doing?

34:33.255 --> 34:35.554
Almost finished.
Keep talking.

34:36.458 --> 34:41.328
Another five minutes and you'll probably
have him catatonic, along with me.

34:42.197 --> 34:44.166
What?
Nothing, just keep talking.

34:44.567 --> 34:47.297
Yeah. Right.
I am kind of good at it.

34:47.703 --> 34:49.431
Hey, go for it, Hig.

34:50.907 --> 34:52.306
Quite. You, too.

34:53.409 --> 34:56.242
Anyway, I first met Luther...

34:56.446 --> 35:01.349
at the King Arthur And His
Court Ballroom. July 12, 1953.

35:01.651 --> 35:06.020
It was 9:30 and I was wearing
this strapless blue gown.

35:06.722 --> 35:08.781
Oh, the big full moon
was shining...

35:08.925 --> 35:11.189
and the Browns lost
a game to the Tigers.

35:11.260 --> 35:12.454
How romantic.

35:13.396 --> 35:17.025
Yeah. Luther and me danced all night.
I made <i>$</i> 450.

35:19.035 --> 35:23.028
And then, after that, Luther came
in every night for a whole week.

35:23.573 --> 35:25.700
And at the end of it,
he popped the question.

35:25.775 --> 35:28.903
He asked me to be his secretary.
Of course, at that time...

35:29.545 --> 35:32.639
boy, I didn't know what it meant
to be a private detective...

35:32.715 --> 35:35.548
much less what a secretary
did for a private detective.

35:35.618 --> 35:38.109
But, boy, I soon found out
the hard way.

35:38.754 --> 35:41.723
Like the time back in 1956...
I've...

35:42.758 --> 35:44.453
finally slipped the knot.

35:45.661 --> 35:47.185
Hey, terrific!

35:51.267 --> 35:53.895
Are you ready?
Yes.

35:57.807 --> 36:00.275
Are you?
Piece of cake.

36:09.185 --> 36:12.052
What's the matter with you?
Nothing, needlehead.

36:24.033 --> 36:25.022
My God.

36:25.701 --> 36:26.895
A piece of cake.

36:27.703 --> 36:30.467
Of course, that was just the
first of a series of blows...

36:30.540 --> 36:33.236
I was about to deliver,
which would have rendered him helpless.

36:33.309 --> 36:35.903
Sure, that's what Luther
always says, too.

36:37.713 --> 36:39.943
We'll walk to the nearest
phone and call a cab.

36:40.016 --> 36:41.813
Great. How much
do you tip these guys?

36:41.884 --> 36:42.976
Nothing.

36:46.589 --> 36:49.524
All expenses are paid
by DeWitt's Dogs.

36:49.959 --> 36:52.689
Including the <i>$</i> 50,000
I'm getting for you two.

36:52.762 --> 36:54.525
Now get back inside.

37:01.687 --> 37:04.121
<i>We left Rick and T.C.
to deal with Artie Keanu...</i>

37:04.190 --> 37:06.681
<i>Big Sally, half the
Honolulu Police Force...</i>

37:06.759 --> 37:08.624
<i>and the biggest bust since...</i>

37:09.095 --> 37:12.223
<i>Since... Well,
the last time we busted Artie Keanu.</i>

37:12.965 --> 37:16.662
<i>The only thing was, I wish I could
have left Luther with them, too.</i>

37:17.003 --> 37:18.766
<i>I was beginning
to get the feeling...</i>

37:18.838 --> 37:21.136
<i>I was stuck with the big guy
for the duration.</i>

37:21.274 --> 37:24.141
<i>The only thing more depressing
than that was this case.</i>

37:24.210 --> 37:26.075
<i>Because we'd run out of leads.</i>

37:26.145 --> 37:28.841
<i>You try being a detective
with no leads.</i>

37:29.015 --> 37:32.143
<i>It's like a tailor without a needle,
or Godzilla without Tokyo.</i>

37:32.218 --> 37:34.209
<i>Or a bad guy without a motive.</i>

37:35.388 --> 37:36.753
Did you say something?

37:37.123 --> 37:39.353
What? No.

37:41.961 --> 37:46.057
I was just thinking, though, you know,
<i>$</i> 50,000 isn't a heck of a lot of money...

37:46.132 --> 37:48.623
to soak Robin Masters for.
He's worth millions.

37:49.402 --> 37:52.701
They had to kidnap Higgins and
Blanche for another reason.

37:53.272 --> 37:57.072
Yeah, us. But we've already been
through that with Artie Canoe.

37:57.143 --> 38:00.704
And as far as I know, this is the
only time you and I work together.

38:00.780 --> 38:03.908
Nice try, big guy, but you'll have
to come up with something else.

38:04.050 --> 38:06.541
Or just go through with the
exchange and hope for the best.

38:06.619 --> 38:09.213
You really believe that?
Not for a second.

38:14.327 --> 38:17.728
What are you making, a little
bunny rabbit? It's not even Easter.

38:18.431 --> 38:22.162
No, it's the Fourth of July.
Bang, bang.

38:22.802 --> 38:24.565
Huh?
Plastique.

38:25.905 --> 38:27.668
I don't care what he's wearing.

38:27.740 --> 38:30.868
I wanna know why he's putting
that clay under our chairs.

38:31.043 --> 38:32.806
To blow us up, evidently.

38:33.412 --> 38:36.643
Excellent deduction.
Maybe you should have been the Pl.

38:37.583 --> 38:38.982
No, thank you.

38:39.519 --> 38:43.455
If I may inquire, though,
what is the purpose of your extortion?

38:43.890 --> 38:45.289
Merely money?

38:45.625 --> 38:48.093
If that is the case,
I can assure you that... Look...

38:48.160 --> 38:51.994
<i>$</i> 50,000 is <i>$</i> 50,000,
but I'm here to settle a score...

38:52.064 --> 38:53.861
I owe Luther Gillis.

38:55.368 --> 38:58.667
Listen, mister,
I've worked for Luther for a long time.

38:58.738 --> 39:01.468
I typed the reports on
every thug he ever busted.

39:01.774 --> 39:05.073
And to be honest with you, I don't
know you from a hole in the ground.

39:05.444 --> 39:09.210
Blanche, maybe this
will jog your memory.

39:09.615 --> 39:13.016
Tiffany Arms Hotel,
December, 1966.

39:13.986 --> 39:17.149
That would be the Frangakis caper.
What about it?

39:17.356 --> 39:20.655
I was the cop who lost his
career because of Luther Gillis.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.450
You were the secret witness?

39:22.728 --> 39:24.787
My whole life down in flames.

39:25.031 --> 39:28.831
Well, you deserved it.
You were a bagman for Tony Frangakis.

39:29.635 --> 39:32.695
Once. One lousy time.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.533
My wife was pregnant
and we needed the money.

39:35.608 --> 39:37.439
So, you didn't go to jail.

39:38.010 --> 39:40.001
Worse. I lost everything.

39:41.881 --> 39:45.977
But, you overcame the setback,
didn't you? You rehabilitated.

39:46.185 --> 39:49.018
You've got a business.
You learned a trade. Hot dogs.

39:50.089 --> 39:51.249
Computers.

39:52.191 --> 39:55.388
Why throw it all away? Why?

39:55.895 --> 39:59.160
For just a fleeting,
transitory moment of revenge?

40:01.467 --> 40:02.525
Yes.

40:08.074 --> 40:10.907
This is no time to be reading your mail.
We got to find some clues.

40:10.977 --> 40:12.604
I think maybe I just have.

40:12.678 --> 40:14.202
That's great news, big guy.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.872
I'm gonna call the convention.

40:17.083 --> 40:19.574
I'll tell them we got
the flu or something.

40:19.652 --> 40:22.246
Some tropical disease
like terminal sunburn.

40:23.155 --> 40:26.647
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lloyd
DeWitt. This is Luther Gillis speaking.

40:27.093 --> 40:28.822
What do you mean he isn't there?

40:29.595 --> 40:30.857
This is Luther Gillis.

40:30.930 --> 40:34.422
I'm supposed to be there tonight to
accept an award for the best book.

40:36.068 --> 40:38.468
What do you mean I was
never gonna get an award?

40:39.572 --> 40:40.664
Luther.

40:40.740 --> 40:44.574
We're talking about <i>So You Want To
Be A Private Eye?</i> by Luther Gillis.

40:44.644 --> 40:46.805
It's supposed... Supposed
to sucker you to Hawaii!

40:46.879 --> 40:48.278
Look at this, Luther.

40:48.681 --> 40:51.047
Big deal. It was typed on
the same typewriter, so what?

40:51.117 --> 40:53.312
Not the same typewriter,
the same computer!

40:53.386 --> 40:55.149
This was done by dot-matrix.

40:55.221 --> 40:57.712
Who's Dot Matrix?
And what's she got to do with this?

40:58.157 --> 41:01.251
She's a computer, Luther.
Now, come on. Look at this.

41:01.327 --> 41:05.491
Lloyd DeWitt accessed into the Academy's
computer just to get you to Hawaii.

41:06.699 --> 41:07.859
Holy cow.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.093
Come on.

41:09.669 --> 41:10.829
Where you going?

41:11.170 --> 41:12.398
To get a hot dog.

41:20.780 --> 41:22.680
Hey, that's my purse.

41:23.149 --> 41:25.049
You won't need it
where you're going.

41:26.352 --> 41:27.751
Wait for me outside.

41:30.389 --> 41:33.825
See you all later.
I'm going to close up the stand forever.

41:39.098 --> 41:40.827
Quite ingenious.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.192
Frankly, I'm impressed.

41:43.736 --> 41:45.294
Frankly, I'm depressed.

41:46.105 --> 41:48.767
And all the time, I thought
DeWitt was stupid...

41:48.841 --> 41:52.709
for having the exchange of prisoners
and ransom occur at the same location.

41:53.379 --> 41:55.370
But how diabolically clever
of him.

41:56.882 --> 42:01.080
You see, if Magnum or your Mr.
Gillis attempt any tricks...

42:02.822 --> 42:05.188
he'll simply blow us up
by remote control.

42:06.792 --> 42:08.020
Extraordinary.

42:08.561 --> 42:10.722
Let's just kick in
the doors and go in blazing.

42:10.796 --> 42:14.357
Look, Luther, even though we're early
and have the advantage of surprise...

42:14.433 --> 42:16.628
I still think we ought to
use some finesse.

42:16.769 --> 42:18.703
I thought I was.
What's your big idea?

42:20.039 --> 42:22.633
Well, I think we ought to do
it this way. Here's the plan.

42:22.708 --> 42:26.075
Save it for dominoes, big guy.
You go in the back, I'll take the front.

42:27.113 --> 42:28.671
That's what I was gonna say.

42:29.348 --> 42:32.511
You know, I think I'm really
beginning to like working with you.

42:32.852 --> 42:35.787
Maybe it's because you've
started reminding me of Chuckie.

42:36.655 --> 42:37.986
Chuckie's dead.

42:38.791 --> 42:40.258
All right, what time is it?

42:42.228 --> 42:43.490
4:53.

42:43.562 --> 42:46.463
That's close enough.
I'll give you three minutes' head start.

42:55.341 --> 42:56.808
<i>Just like the last time...</i>

42:56.876 --> 42:59.208
<i>when we thought Artie Keanu
had Blanche and Higgins...</i>

42:59.278 --> 43:01.906
<i>we were going into a
dangerous situation blind.</i>

43:01.981 --> 43:05.473
<i>But, unlike the last time,
we had a couple of things going for us.</i>

43:05.551 --> 43:08.850
<i>One, we definitely knew where
Blanche and Higgins were.</i>

43:08.921 --> 43:12.448
<i>And two, for the first time
I really had the feeling...</i>

43:12.525 --> 43:14.720
<i>that Luther and I were
really working together.</i>

43:15.327 --> 43:16.316
<i>It felt good.</i>

43:17.062 --> 43:18.290
To hell with it!

43:19.698 --> 43:21.131
This feels great.

43:30.810 --> 43:33.608
DeWitt, give me one blonde to
go and throw in the butler.

43:33.679 --> 43:37.115
You're through. Spring them or
I'll make you part of the menu.

43:37.950 --> 43:41.113
I wish you'd try, Gillis,
I'd just love it if you would.

43:41.187 --> 43:43.678
Forget about the radio,
this is no time for music.

43:43.756 --> 43:46.054
The only singing you're gonna
do is in a cage. Let's go.

43:46.125 --> 43:49.356
Don't make me nervous. If you had any
technical sophistication at all...

43:49.428 --> 43:52.693
you'd realize that this
is a remote control unit.

43:52.765 --> 43:57.327
All I have to do is press that button
and your Blanche and that Englishman...

43:57.403 --> 43:59.633
will leave this world,
literally.

44:00.840 --> 44:03.001
All right, what do you want?
<i>$</i> 50,000?

44:03.409 --> 44:06.867
If I knew you needed money, I would've
signed over the royalties of my book.

44:07.146 --> 44:08.636
Cut with the jokes, Gillis.

44:08.714 --> 44:12.047
All I need <i>$</i> 50,000 for is to leave
the country after I kill you.

44:12.117 --> 44:13.243
Now drop the gun.

44:13.853 --> 44:16.686
Okay, but now
you got to say why.

44:17.723 --> 44:19.247
Tony Frangakis.

44:19.325 --> 44:21.919
Who?
Tony Frangakis.

44:23.596 --> 44:25.894
Well, what about him?
Is he your brother or something?

44:25.965 --> 44:30.026
No. No, I worked for him.
Once. Once.

44:30.669 --> 44:33.160
And then you busted him
and I got caught in the net.

44:33.539 --> 44:36.975
It's funny, I was so small then,
you didn't even know who I was.

44:37.109 --> 44:39.771
I guess things have kind of
changed now, haven't they?

44:42.014 --> 44:44.414
Wait a minute, where's Magnum?

44:44.683 --> 44:47.379
No! He's got a...

44:55.060 --> 44:56.152
Blanche!

44:57.396 --> 44:59.193
Blanche!
Luther!

44:59.598 --> 45:03.796
Blanche! She's dead.
And the butler, too.

45:03.936 --> 45:05.198
Luther.

45:05.271 --> 45:08.866
Blanche, Blanche, I'm so sorry.

45:09.074 --> 45:10.200
Luther.

45:10.276 --> 45:12.904
He killed them.
They're dead. They're dead.

45:13.312 --> 45:15.473
This time I was
really gonna do it.

45:15.547 --> 45:16.707
Luther, listen to me.

45:16.782 --> 45:20.218
Blanche, I know you can't hear me,
but I want you to know...

45:20.286 --> 45:22.618
this time I was
really gonna marry you.

45:22.855 --> 45:23.947
I really...

45:33.499 --> 45:36.991
Luther, I tried to tell you.
I got them out.

45:56.889 --> 45:57.981
You know something...

45:58.057 --> 46:01.322
this is going to be
the best, most wonderful...

46:01.393 --> 46:03.861
happy day of my entire life.

46:05.631 --> 46:08.395
I just wonder
what's keeping Luther.

46:13.672 --> 46:14.934
He's 20 minutes late.

46:15.007 --> 46:16.565
I know.
Where is he?

46:17.576 --> 46:18.770
He' s coming.

46:37.796 --> 46:39.058
Blanche Rafferty?

46:57.883 --> 47:00.750
"Sorry I missed the wedding.
Stop."

47:00.919 --> 47:02.978
"Had to go back. Stop."

47:03.389 --> 47:05.584
"Some bozos got Jack. Stop."

47:05.991 --> 47:08.653
"Say hi to the big guy
and the butler. Stop."

47:09.328 --> 47:10.955
"Love, Luther. Stop."

47:14.366 --> 47:15.663
Oh, my God.

47:29.615 --> 47:31.913
<i>Well,
I got out of that one, kiddos.</i>

47:32.184 --> 47:34.049
<i>But I knew Blanche
would get over it...</i>

47:34.186 --> 47:35.551
<i>after a while.</i>

47:36.121 --> 47:37.315
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

47:38.023 --> 47:40.116
<i>I had a loose end to tie up.</i>
