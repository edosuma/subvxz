WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.915
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.971 --> 00:06.315
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.373 --> 00:08.943
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.920
These are their stories.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.619
(TRAFFIC HUMMING)

00:16.015 --> 00:18.326
Jimmy, the flowers were a bad idea.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.126
I shouldn't even be here.

00:20.187 --> 00:23.100
Don't be like that. There he is.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.140
Ten hours on a bus from Montreal,

00:29.196 --> 00:31.733
my roids are screaming blue murder.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.138
Well, welcome home, Mickey.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.815
We need to talk. Where's your car?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.521
In the lot, down by 9th.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.452
Look, you're gonna have to take a cab.

00:50.517 --> 00:52.326
Roseanne, I'm sorry.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.662
What about the USB account?

00:58.725 --> 00:59.897
Empty.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.871
They're all, except Trust
House and Citibank.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.738
Those I managed to close
before he got to them.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.504
I put the money in a safety deposit box.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.102
Son of a bitch!

01:08.201 --> 01:11.410
And Dougie did all this by himself?

01:11.538 --> 01:13.347
Just don't hurt him.

01:16.810 --> 01:20.155
(STUTTERING)
Mickey, I didn't know it was yours.

01:21.848 --> 01:23.452
Who did you think it belonged to,

01:23.517 --> 01:25.588
you worthless twit, Santa Claus?

01:25.686 --> 01:29.259
You don't understand. This is the
most important thing in my life.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.360
That money is my life!

01:31.692 --> 01:33.171
And I want it back,

01:33.226 --> 01:35.729
every penny, or I swear to God,

01:35.796 --> 01:38.072
I'll take it out of your hide.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.102
Mmm?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.214
You've worked too hard for this.

01:49.376 --> 01:50.753
Maybe I should just give it back.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.449
Baby, you're slipping.

01:52.512 --> 01:53.855
Let me call them.

01:56.383 --> 01:59.421
Look, Doug, we need their help.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.106
JIMMY: Doug's apartment is empty.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.300
Nobody's seen him since yesterday.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.707
His mother'll know where he is.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:23.143 --> 02:24.645
He called her.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.553
I promised her he wouldn't get hurt.

02:28.615 --> 02:32.119
Seabreeze Motel in Montauk, Room 114.

02:41.028 --> 02:42.371
Excuse me.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.699
You're excused.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.541
Stand up, you son of a bitch!

03:50.497 --> 03:52.875
The old man, Mickey Connelly,
owns this place.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.469
His son Jimmy used it as an office

03:54.534 --> 03:55.774
when he was out of the country.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.611
The old man was ducking a RICO indictment

03:57.671 --> 03:59.150
for bookmaking on the internet.

03:59.206 --> 04:02.119
Yeah, well, his legal troubles are over now.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.578
Got a murder here,

04:04.644 --> 04:06.419
suicide there. He ate the gun.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.551
Cleaning service found them this morning.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.993
Time of death sometime last night.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.889
- Thanks.
- All right.

04:13.019 --> 04:14.828
Can I get a pair of tweezers please?

04:14.888 --> 04:18.927
This must be some of that father-son
bonding I've heard so much about.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.569
These cuts were made before he died,

04:22.629 --> 04:25.337
but for some reason they were untreated.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.606
I'll be over here while you do that.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.687
It's frosted glass.

04:47.587 --> 04:48.793
He has

04:49.956 --> 04:54.735
abrasions delicately around
the sides of his mouth.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.911
Well, he was gagged.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.446
Explains why he didn't answer his phone.

05:02.502 --> 05:03.742
He's got voice-mail.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.250
The lab can retrieve the messages.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.382
Mickey's passport.

05:12.579 --> 05:16.083
Irish customs entry stamp
dated November last year.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.090
Exit stamp dated two weeks ago.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.194
Having fun?

05:21.254 --> 05:23.962
I'm listening. He left Ireland two weeks ago.

05:24.024 --> 05:27.062
Canadian customs stamp,
also from two weeks ago.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.538
No US stamp.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.833
Make a note to the ME
to check for ocular fluids.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.476
His eyes are dry and irritated.

05:35.535 --> 05:37.310
The mucus is thick.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.743
Could be from sleep deprivation.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.213
And he's dehydrated.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.781
His cuticles have shrunk.

05:48.481 --> 05:51.587
Maybe Junior kept him on ice
before killing him.

05:53.119 --> 05:54.792
Except that Junior

05:57.057 --> 05:58.900
shows the same signs.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.333
Mickey had to have a damn good reason

06:03.396 --> 06:05.672
to come back and risk getting
pinched on a fugitive warrant.

06:05.732 --> 06:06.904
How's $2 million bucks?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.607
That's what the DA's always figured
he had stashed away somewhere.

06:09.669 --> 06:10.943
Works for me.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.041
The old man found out the
kid was skimming from him,

06:13.106 --> 06:15.017
they got their Irish up.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.248
I don't think that they got anything up.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.654
The ME found elevated levels of sodium,

06:19.713 --> 06:22.057
urea, nitrogen in the eye mucus,

06:22.115 --> 06:25.289
kidney and liver enzymes
outside the normal range.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.759
Stomach and the bowels empty.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.764
Now, the Connellys, they were starved,

06:31.825 --> 06:34.271
sleep deprived, dehydrated.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.704
They sound like POWs.

06:35.762 --> 06:37.673
The ME also found minute traces of duct tape

06:37.731 --> 06:40.177
around the ankles and wrists of both men.

06:40.233 --> 06:44.204
The tech's got the code for Mickey's
voice-mail. His son's birth date.

06:45.605 --> 06:46.879
(BEEPING)

06:47.107 --> 06:49.485
“It's Roseanne again, calling for Jimmy.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.613
“It's been a week. I need to hear from you.

06:51.678 --> 06:52.679
“Just call me.”

06:52.746 --> 06:54.020
(BEEPING)

06:54.080 --> 06:56.082
Roseanne would be Jimmy's wife.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.753
Last Wednesday.

06:58.518 --> 07:01.158
It's a week since she's heard from him.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.768
You think she would've filed
a missing persons report.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.341
I thought he was away on business.

07:10.397 --> 07:13.207
I didn't even know he was with his father.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.141
You've been camping out in here?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.746
Andy fell asleep watching a video.

07:18.805 --> 07:20.216
I didn't wanna move him.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.550
I noticed that your bedrooms,
they face the street.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.295
Is it safer back here?

07:34.554 --> 07:35.658
You're terrified.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.703
Anybody that has the front to
kill Mickey Connelly and his son

07:38.758 --> 07:40.999
might just come after you, too.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.543
You knew Jimmy was in trouble.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.779
Maybe you had something to do with it?

08:00.280 --> 08:02.783
(STUTTERING)
He called Thursday.

08:03.550 --> 08:07.555
He tried to pretend everything
was okay, but I knew better.

08:07.620 --> 08:08.894
EAMES: Where was he?

08:08.955 --> 08:12.402
He was with Mickey. He said he'd be home soon.

08:12.459 --> 08:15.531
There was some problem,
some money was missing.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.839
He called you just to check in?

08:18.965 --> 08:22.845
No, he wanted Andy's Social Security
number. He didn't say why.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.279
Your son have a bank account?

08:33.046 --> 08:35.116
They opened an account
for the kid when he was born.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.059
Last month Jimmy got a safe
deposit box under the account.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.826
The bank says he emptied the box 2 days ago.

08:40.886 --> 08:43.390
2 days ago he was dead. So
who emptied the box?

08:43.456 --> 08:45.595
We're checking the bank security tapes.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.766
GOREN: That's him.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.437
DEAKINS: We know this guy?

08:51.498 --> 08:53.478
These are the left ears of both men.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.078
Same shape.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.079
Similar lobes.

09:00.607 --> 09:03.247
Ear structure patterns run in families.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.753
Especially siblings.

09:14.587 --> 09:15.930
Want some?

09:16.289 --> 09:17.791
(DOOR OPENING)

09:19.626 --> 09:21.663
He'll meet you tomorrow
when they break for lunch.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.471
Doug, it's almost over now.

09:24.531 --> 09:27.535
No one can ever tell you what to do again.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.748
GOREN: His name is Douglas Morgan.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.752
He's Mickey's son by his second ex-wife.

09:34.808 --> 09:35.809
Jimmy's half-brother.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.013
How come we never heard of him?

09:37.077 --> 09:39.819
Well, there's no record he's ever been
involved in his father's business.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.790
Just a couple of misdemeanor forgeries.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.691
He's been a pipsqueak up until now.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.922
You like this guy.

09:44.984 --> 09:47.396
Well, a nobody who scammed the scam artist?

09:47.454 --> 09:48.694
I'd buy him a drink.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.063
First, you have to find him.

09:50.123 --> 09:54.037
He moved out of his last known 3 years
ago. No job since last winter.

09:54.094 --> 09:58.236
Credit report says he got 5 credit
cards in the last 4 months.

09:59.232 --> 10:02.805
They never learn. If you
don't want to be found, pay cash.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.616
Mr. Morgan, he checked out last Monday.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.086
He was here for a couple of weeks.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.315
By himself?

10:11.377 --> 10:12.981
He had visitors.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.217
No, I didn't notice those two.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.318
Who did you notice?

10:18.384 --> 10:22.696
Well, this one young man
with blond hair, goatee.

10:22.755 --> 10:25.998
He spent a lot of time parked
out here in a chair, reading.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.039
Well, you'd think he'd be warmer inside.

10:28.094 --> 10:31.735
I figured Mr. Morgan had company

10:31.798 --> 10:34.506
and this fellow was giving him his privacy.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.513
GOREN: Well, that's one way to look at it.

10:39.606 --> 10:42.280
This room is very clean.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.715
There's no marks.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.818
No fingerprints.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.728
Same story here.

10:51.784 --> 10:53.491
We keep things tidy.

10:54.220 --> 10:57.133
Anybody stay here since Mr. Morgan left?

10:57.724 --> 10:58.725
KEPPLER: Nah.

10:58.791 --> 11:01.271
We don't get a lot of traffic
out here after Labor Day.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.637
When did they replace the shower door?

11:05.131 --> 11:06.508
We didn't.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.785
There's lime encrustation

11:16.342 --> 11:18.618
and soap residue on this door.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.182
And there's none on this one

11:22.248 --> 11:25.889
and the caulking is still soft.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.493
This shower door was broken,
and they replaced it.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.400
The frosted glass in Jimmy's arm.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.028
They were here.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.607
They were kept here for two weeks.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.174
Two men in a tub.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.415
Last year, when Mickey went on the lam,

11:48.474 --> 11:52.115
a dozen bank accounts were opened using
Doug Morgan's Social Security number.

11:52.178 --> 11:55.455
Within two months, there was nearly
$2 million dollars in those accounts.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.223
Mickey hid the money under Doug's
name without telling Doug,

11:58.284 --> 12:00.093
figuring no one would look there.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.223
Somehow Dougie found out.

12:01.287 --> 12:04.291
Starting 4 months ago, he emptied
all but 2 of the accounts.

12:04.357 --> 12:08.134
Those 2 accounts were closed the same
day Jimmy opened the safe deposit box.

12:08.194 --> 12:11.107
We think that Jimmy got wind
of what was going on

12:11.164 --> 12:13.110
and got the money out before Doug did.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.271
And put it in the safe deposit box.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.770
So Dougie tortured his father and his brother

12:17.837 --> 12:19.817
just to squeeze the last dollar out of them?

12:19.872 --> 12:21.909
Well, the last $200,000.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.454
What the hell is wrong with this kid?

12:23.509 --> 12:25.546
Didn't daddy spend enough
time playing catch with him?

12:25.612 --> 12:27.387
Or he got too much attention from his mother.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.860
His last parole report says he was
living with her as of 3 years ago.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.294
How sweet.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.828
VERA: Dougie thought he had a God-given right

12:38.891 --> 12:40.962
to freeload off his mother.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.440
Uh-uh.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.499
Don't walk there.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.876
- You're gonna make dirt on my carpet here.
- Yeah.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.279
Put these on. I got them at the hospital.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.685
Put them over your feet.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.679
There's only 3 of them.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.247
Well, someone could sit on a chair.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.394
This is a one bedroom, right?

13:07.453 --> 13:08.830
Mmm-hmm.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.460
Where did Doug sleep?

13:11.524 --> 13:14.266
Where do you think? On the couch.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.341
I used to have a bigger place,

13:17.397 --> 13:20.276
but after I got out of the hospital

13:20.333 --> 13:23.280
cleaning a big place didn't appeal to me.

13:24.203 --> 13:27.116
What about his father, Mickey?
You been in touch with him?

13:27.173 --> 13:29.414
What do I want with that louse?

13:29.842 --> 13:33.255
A louse who knows his way to your heart.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.027
Thank you.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.567
That's $73.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.105
It's a bit expensive.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.011
I mean, unless it's Canadian dollars.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.979
Did Mickey drop it off?

13:57.270 --> 14:01.082
I wouldn't set foot in the
same room with that man,

14:02.475 --> 14:06.116
unless it was to go to his wake.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.116
Just your luck.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.227
He was found dead 4 days ago.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.825
Oh...

14:17.223 --> 14:19.100
Dear Mary. Oh.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.039
What about his boy, Jimmy?

14:30.837 --> 14:32.748
Why, you like Jimmy?

14:35.041 --> 14:36.884
He was decent enough.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.221
Hadn't been for Jimmy,

14:41.814 --> 14:44.886
Dougie wouldn't have even
known he had a father.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.256
Jimmy brought this to you?

14:50.156 --> 14:52.193
Came over looking for Doug?

14:53.493 --> 14:57.771
And you knew where he was, because
Doug keeps in touch with his mother.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.001
Yeah.

15:01.934 --> 15:05.177
He told me if Jimmy comes asking for him,

15:06.272 --> 15:08.013
to say where he is.

15:10.042 --> 15:12.044
And when Jimmy left here,

15:12.945 --> 15:15.983
you called Doug and told him
that Jimmy was on the way?

15:16.249 --> 15:18.923
Dougie wouldn't hurt Jimmy. He loved him!

15:19.352 --> 15:21.389
We still need to find him.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.832
Mickey left a lot of money behind.

15:26.225 --> 15:27.431
Really?

15:28.728 --> 15:32.767
You mean, like clean money
that could go to Dougie?

15:33.366 --> 15:35.004
If we can find him.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.272
I don't have his address.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.652
It's in Brooklyn. It's a sublet.

15:46.712 --> 15:50.626
He said over on Ovington.
A nice, bright place.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.287
EAMES: You been?

15:52.418 --> 15:54.193
He sent the picture.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.127
No return address.

15:58.324 --> 15:59.598
Bird seed.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.669
We just ask the neighborhood
bird seed store.

16:03.729 --> 16:07.108
Look, through the window,
across the street, on the roof.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.303
A pigeon coop.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.978
You've come a long way, Doug.

16:14.907 --> 16:18.480
No more self-doubt, no more negativity.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.214
Thank you, sir.

16:31.123 --> 16:34.070
This isn't just a gift to the program, Doug,

16:34.460 --> 16:36.565
this is a gift to yourself.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.306
I'm proud of you.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.819
I'm sure Lena is, too.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.864
You go home. I'll catch up later.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.352
There, second floor.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.257
It's the same color curtains.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.289
(DOORBELL BUZZING)

17:42.695 --> 17:45.869
All these show is a man resembling my
client entering and leaving a room.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.434
What he did in there is anyone's guess.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.104
We guess he stole the contents

17:49.168 --> 17:50.511
of his brother's safe deposit box.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.640
Right, Doug?

17:51.704 --> 17:54.344
COOPER: My guess, you got nothing
and we're not adding to it.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.246
I think your client has something to say.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.594
Am I right? You have something to tell us?

18:07.086 --> 18:10.932
You think I'm responsible for what
happened to my father and Jimmy.

18:11.223 --> 18:14.102
Well, are you?

18:14.160 --> 18:15.264
COOPER: Now, wait a minute.

18:15.328 --> 18:18.207
No, wait. You gotta say it out
loud, so we all understand.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.504
Don't say a word.

18:19.565 --> 18:22.842
When you see things clearly,
you make them happen.

18:24.403 --> 18:27.316
I did what I had to do. I killed them.

18:27.873 --> 18:31.013
COOPER: Okay, he did that against
the advice of his counsel.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.921
I need to speak to him in a room, right now.

18:39.585 --> 18:41.496
Well, that was smooth.

18:42.221 --> 18:44.531
You better get Carver down here.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.036
Do you have the letter
that he sent his mother?

18:57.069 --> 18:59.982
This spontaneous statement might not
take the place of a confession,

19:00.039 --> 19:02.645
but I can't see how his
lawyer can step away from it.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.710
GOREN: He's using an interesting vocabulary.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.553
Is this something I should be concerned with?

19:07.613 --> 19:09.524
Here's another one.
"Without your encouragement,

19:09.582 --> 19:13.029
"I'd still be someone without a future,
sleeping on his mother's couch."

19:13.085 --> 19:15.258
He thanks her for kicking him out.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.732
This about Doug Morgan?

19:16.789 --> 19:19.326
It's the letter that he wrote his mother.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.064
The first part, he apologizes for
the hurt that he caused her.

19:22.128 --> 19:25.007
Second part, he thanks her for
everything that she's done for him.

19:25.064 --> 19:28.341
Last part, he lays out
his plan for his future.

19:28.801 --> 19:32.476
"I now understand I need to develop
a new strategy for my life,

19:32.538 --> 19:36.645
"a new program for the
software of my conceptions."

19:37.643 --> 19:38.781
It's gobbledygook.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.619
It's high-level gobbledygook.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.253
This is from a guy who didn't
even finish the 10th grade.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.796
These are not his ideas.

19:48.921 --> 19:52.459
You saw the way he glanced up
every time before he spoke?

19:53.959 --> 19:55.802
Manson's women

19:56.262 --> 19:59.300
did the same thing during
their murder trials.

19:59.398 --> 20:00.672
He's visualizing.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.637
Visualizing what?

20:02.702 --> 20:05.649
No, not what. Who.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.281
DEAKINS: What's he looking at?

20:14.380 --> 20:17.657
GOREN: He's looking for
support, for direction.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.762
He's looking for her.

20:32.998 --> 20:34.705
No, no, no.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.671
I don't know these people.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.114
Mr. Morgan, if someone influenced you,

20:39.171 --> 20:41.378
it would mitigate your responsibility.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.423
I am responsible.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.519
Nobody told me what to do.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.925
You did it to transform yourself?

20:51.650 --> 20:54.153
That's what it says
in the letter to your mother.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.492
Your "Negative self-programming"

20:57.556 --> 21:01.003
was leading you to "a
counter-effective life strategy."

21:01.227 --> 21:02.297
Yes.

21:04.663 --> 21:07.200
You wanted to transform your context.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.869
Yes. That's what I did.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.936
What's a "context", Doug?

21:27.453 --> 21:29.763
You know, Doug, it's in your letter.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.200
You don't you know what it means?

21:35.861 --> 21:39.206
(STUTTERING)
It's hard to say.

21:44.403 --> 21:46.474
Because someone told you to write it?

21:47.439 --> 21:48.918
This girl?

21:50.242 --> 21:52.984
Is that who you picture when you look up?

21:57.149 --> 21:58.184
No.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.066
I am the author of my life
and I make the choices.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.770
And I choose, I don't wanna
talk to you anymore.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.939
I took another look at Doug's credit cards.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.140
Every couple of weeks,

22:18.204 --> 22:20.115
there's a $400 to $500 charge

22:20.172 --> 22:22.152
to one of two out-of-state companies.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.745
It'll take a few days to chase them down.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.856
Every couple of weeks.

22:29.615 --> 22:31.288
All right, try a keyword search.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.762
Use "Context transformation."

22:37.756 --> 22:39.895
Nearly a thousand results.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.098
Now refine it. Add "Tuition".

23:02.548 --> 23:05.028

23:05.451 --> 23:07.226

23:08.220 --> 23:09.961
At the head of the class.

23:10.256 --> 23:12.258

We're supposed to wait for the
person who told us about GraceNote.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.630
PEGGY: Just register and go in.
I'm sure she'll show up.

23:39.685 --> 23:42.131
Well, I would, except Mr. Skeptic here...

23:42.187 --> 23:43.791
We only knew what she told us,

23:43.856 --> 23:45.335
we don't even know her name.

23:45.391 --> 23:48.964
Maybe you know her. She said
her picture was on your webpage.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.133
Could you look it up on your laptop?

23:52.264 --> 23:54.505
Hey. Nice to see you.

23:58.537 --> 24:00.016
I don't know her.

24:00.072 --> 24:03.315
Well, maybe someone in charge
does. What about him?

24:03.409 --> 24:04.786
Bye, see you then.

24:04.843 --> 24:07.255
That's Randall Fuller. He founded GraceNote.

24:07.313 --> 24:08.986
Well, even better.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.060
Mr. Fuller,

24:12.918 --> 24:15.899
we were invited here by
someone who works for you.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.491
We don't know that, honey.

24:17.556 --> 24:18.694
Well...

24:19.458 --> 24:22.268
You can see she's helping
with the seminar, right there.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.740
Anyway, nobody seems to know her...

24:28.367 --> 24:30.506
Nobody seems to know her...

24:31.236 --> 24:33.216
You made us, didn't you?

24:34.273 --> 24:35.513
What gave us away?

24:35.574 --> 24:36.985
Her sensible shoes.

24:37.042 --> 24:40.148
And her sleeve, it's shiny from
rubbing against your holster.

24:40.212 --> 24:43.318
Oh, and your belt is scratched
where you clip your badge.

24:43.382 --> 24:44.383
He's good.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.726
Yeah, well, reading people
is part of what I do.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.696
And to answer your question, Detectives,

24:48.754 --> 24:51.132
she's probably a student volunteer.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.069
Since everyone who attends our
seminars signs a photo release,

24:54.126 --> 24:56.367
we'd have no way of identifying her.

24:57.529 --> 24:59.440
What about Doug Morgan?

25:02.134 --> 25:04.171
He attended your seminars.

25:21.086 --> 25:22.622
I thought I was gonna pop a valve.

25:22.688 --> 25:27.637
4 hours of constant promises of a
better life or a more confident self.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.798
It was a sales pitch
for their weekend seminar,

25:29.862 --> 25:31.705
which is a warm-up for their insight series,

25:31.764 --> 25:34.176
the mentors program, the destiny workshops.

25:34.233 --> 25:37.214
You could spend $30 grand
on the whole nine yards.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.805
Is it a cult, mind control?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.111
- No.
- Yes.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.543
How reassuring.

25:41.607 --> 25:44.611
They use the same psychological
coercion as cults.

25:44.676 --> 25:46.212
So did the guy who sold me my car.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.554
No one forced those people
to stay last night,

25:48.614 --> 25:49.820
they were enjoying themselves.

25:49.882 --> 25:54.388
They stayed because of peer-group
pressure, manufactured peer-group.

25:54.453 --> 25:57.161
They pay to sit in a room for hours on end.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.828
They submit to group hypnosis,

25:59.892 --> 26:01.530
deep breathing, guided imagery...

26:01.593 --> 26:05.370
That's a relaxation technique. Those people
did not look like zombies when they came out.

26:05.431 --> 26:08.071
No, they were euphoric.
They got a shot of optimism.

26:08.133 --> 26:10.841
It's very powerful. They can't
wait to repeat the experience.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.439
So they sign up for another seminar.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.006
If it helps them, what's the harm?

26:14.073 --> 26:18.146
Is it possible it had a more
profound effect on Doug Morgan?

26:19.778 --> 26:24.420
What, someone susceptible, unhappy,
with no clear sense of himself?

26:30.556 --> 26:31.660
Look,

26:32.391 --> 26:34.496
strip down all the double-talk,

26:34.560 --> 26:39.009
what is it that Randall Fuller
really said to those people?

26:39.398 --> 26:42.004
Everything that you've done is wrong.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.274
Everything you are is false.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.044
But it's not your fault,
you were programmed that way.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.947
Leave it to GraceNote
to give you back your life.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.287
It's very seductive.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.723
And they just happened to pick
Doug to work their magic on?

26:55.781 --> 26:57.954
Every participant signs a release form.

26:58.016 --> 27:00.690
The small print gives them the
right to run a credit check.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.891
They found the bank accounts under his name.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.957
They knew before he did
how much money he was worth.

27:05.023 --> 27:06.161
GOREN: And they played him.

27:06.225 --> 27:09.229
He can't be the first one.
Check with consumer affairs.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.137
If we can establish a criminal pattern,

27:11.196 --> 27:13.540
we can bring GraceNote to a crashing halt.

27:16.602 --> 27:19.310
We went to one of their weekend seminars.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.544
I used to feel so isolated, but…

27:22.007 --> 27:23.987
after that weekend, I never felt so...

27:24.042 --> 27:25.646
GOREN: So alive?

27:28.313 --> 27:30.953
And the 2 of you signed up for more classes.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.727
No. Just me.

27:33.819 --> 27:37.460
I had seminars every night,
every other weekend.

27:37.756 --> 27:39.326
There were cruises.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.064
What kept you going back?

27:41.126 --> 27:43.697
Being in that room, being told that

27:44.329 --> 27:46.866
my life had limitless possibilities.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.305
I needed to keep hearing it.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.713
Tell me how they got your money.

27:54.139 --> 27:56.710
I was encouraged to make large gifts.

27:58.210 --> 28:01.817
Encouraged you, specifically,
who encouraged you?

28:01.947 --> 28:04.257
Well, at first, the higher-ups
in the organization.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.318
And eventually, they
brought in Randall Fuller.

28:06.385 --> 28:07.557
He was the closer.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.599
Yeah, and he was very good at it.

28:09.655 --> 28:12.397
By that point I wasn't thinking very clearly.

28:12.457 --> 28:14.767
Why did you drop your complaint?

28:22.367 --> 28:24.472
Was there a woman involved?

28:25.237 --> 28:26.307
Yes.

28:29.975 --> 28:33.616
I thought she was another student like me.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.590
I see now I was being handled.

28:39.985 --> 28:41.055
Yes.

28:43.589 --> 28:45.933
That's her. That's her.

28:48.493 --> 28:49.938
Lena Caruso.

28:57.636 --> 28:59.138
He needs to see you.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.213
I know. I'm meeting him tomorrow.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.118
He's going out of town for the
day. It has to be tonight.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.614
He's sorry.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.452
That isn't a problem, is it?

29:21.193 --> 29:25.266
RAFI: A maid found her in a bathtub
in a motel room in Long Island City.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.604
She'd opened her veins.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.906
EAMES: Yeah, I have
hesitation cuts on this one.

29:28.967 --> 29:30.446
Yeah. Same here.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.544
She probably did it to herself.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.414
Lips are cracked, gums are drawn back.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.545
Cuticles are cracked pre-mortem.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.957
Dehydration, starvation.

29:41.546 --> 29:43.719
The GraceNote suicide diet.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.231
GOREN: Her family in Cleveland got
a letter from her 3 years ago.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.735
Same format as Doug's.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.135
I'm sorry, I'm grateful, I'm movin’ on.

29:55.193 --> 29:56.501
That's the last they heard from her.

29:56.561 --> 29:58.097
- And the Connelly's money?
- Gone.

29:58.163 --> 29:59.642
Into GraceNote's coffers.

29:59.698 --> 30:00.768
That hasn't been proven yet.

30:00.832 --> 30:02.834
That's who she worked for.
That's why she's dead.

30:02.901 --> 30:05.507
Even your dentist thought she was
just a student at GraceNote.

30:05.570 --> 30:07.709
He also said that Fuller's the
one who closed the deals.

30:07.773 --> 30:11.585
Look, Doug Morgan, he loved his
brother, he feared his father.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.852
Fuller's the only one that could've
convinced him to kill both of them.

30:14.913 --> 30:16.756
You believe it. I'm happy to prosecute it.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.261
Just get Doug Morgan to confirm it.

30:20.686 --> 30:24.224
Four hundred, five hundred, twelve hundred.

30:24.289 --> 30:27.236
It goes on and on, Doug. All
the money you paid to GraceNote.

30:27.292 --> 30:30.330
I took their classes because I wanted to.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.872
They helped me a lot.

30:31.930 --> 30:34.206
Well, tell us what you learned, Doug.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.370
Well,

30:36.335 --> 30:37.905
I learned that

30:37.969 --> 30:41.382
I wasn't living a real life.

30:41.840 --> 30:46.585
I was making decisions because of
things that happened to me in my past.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.887
Right, you started questioning
everything you did.

30:49.948 --> 30:52.224
Am I really making a free choice

30:52.284 --> 30:55.527
or am I being controlled
by the bad programming in...

30:56.521 --> 31:00.435
What is it GraceNote calls it,
my psychic drive?

31:00.625 --> 31:02.662
Yes, because you can't trust the past.

31:02.728 --> 31:06.676
There's what happened, and what
you tell yourself happened.

31:07.132 --> 31:08.543
It was holding me back.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.079
Holding you back from what?

31:10.135 --> 31:11.341
From...

31:12.437 --> 31:14.439
From being extraordinary.

31:17.809 --> 31:21.882
GOREN: It's hard to explain if you
haven't been through GraceNote.

31:21.947 --> 31:23.449
Yes. They don't get it.

31:23.515 --> 31:27.361
It was worth a lot to you, and you
showed your appreciation with gifts.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.660
The money that you took from
your father, it wasn't for you,

31:29.721 --> 31:31.826
you gave it to GraceNote.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.267
As a gift.

31:33.325 --> 31:36.329
Did Mr. Fuller know
where the money came from?

31:37.062 --> 31:39.508
I told him my family gave it to me.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.711
Doug, you remember the girl from the bank?

31:41.767 --> 31:44.475
Her name was Lena. You met
her at GraceNote, right?

31:45.804 --> 31:47.477
She was taking classes with me.

31:47.539 --> 31:50.986
She helped you decide to make
those gifts to Randall Fuller.

31:51.042 --> 31:53.283
We talked about it, but I decided.

31:53.345 --> 31:56.986
Randall Fuller used Lena to convince
you to give that money to GraceNote.

31:57.048 --> 32:00.154
He manipulated you into killing
your father and brother.

32:00.218 --> 32:03.222
No, no, Lena is in love with me.

32:03.288 --> 32:06.599
She decided to be with me.
She made that decision.

32:10.061 --> 32:12.803
Fuller makes the decisions.

32:14.566 --> 32:16.170
That's not true.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.739
GOREN: Doug, listen to me.

32:19.538 --> 32:23.315
Lena is dead. She committed
suicide last weekend.

32:25.710 --> 32:28.088
You see how her lips are chapped?

32:28.847 --> 32:31.384
The cracked cuticles on her fingers?

32:35.821 --> 32:39.769
Those are the same things we found
on your dad and your brother.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.594
Lena was denied sleep,

32:43.228 --> 32:45.230
food, water.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.537
(groaning)

32:47.432 --> 32:49.469
Doug, he broke her.

32:49.534 --> 32:50.569
It's not true.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.137
He drove her to suicide.

32:52.204 --> 32:55.185
It's bad programming. It's
just a story from your past.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.310
Doug, it's what happened.

32:56.374 --> 32:57.717
No! You...

32:57.943 --> 33:01.083
(STUTTERING)
It's how you see it.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.183
It's the story you tell.

33:03.248 --> 33:04.989
It's how you see it.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.929
It's not the way it is.

33:07.986 --> 33:11.365
You can't differentiate one
thing from another, you...

33:11.957 --> 33:13.231
(BANGING)

33:13.825 --> 33:14.963
(DOOR BUZZING)

33:18.129 --> 33:19.767
I know how it is.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.272
I get it.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.578
You don't. You're not clear.

33:30.775 --> 33:33.779
I'm getting a sense my client
might be amending his plea.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.792
Not guilty by reason of mental disease?

33:40.585 --> 33:42.360
I don't know about an insanity defense,

33:42.420 --> 33:46.163
but his credibility as a witness
against Fuller is doubtful.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.932
Assuming he'd even testify against Fuller.

33:48.994 --> 33:53.136
CARVER: Must be frustrating,
a mind even you can't unlock.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.972
Well, let's get someone who can.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.877
The person who locked it in the first place.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.413
FULLER: (ON MIKE) ...
your life, your day. Thank you.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.285
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

34:07.746 --> 34:09.248
- Mr. Fuller...
- I have a car waiting.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.554
We'll take you wherever you like.

34:11.616 --> 34:13.721
We asked you if you knew
a man named Doug Morgan.

34:13.784 --> 34:16.025
He attended your seminars,
but you didn't remember him.

34:16.087 --> 34:17.565
Right, I was in a hurry.

34:17.621 --> 34:18.828
You mean, you remember him now?

34:18.889 --> 34:21.130
Oh, yes, of course. He made
a large donation to GraceNote.

34:21.192 --> 34:22.967
He told us a little over $2,000,000.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.599
Yeah, somewhere in that neighborhood.
Why, is there a problem?

34:25.664 --> 34:29.168
Yes, see, Doug Morgan stole that money
from his father's bookmaking operation.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.577
I had no idea.

34:30.635 --> 34:34.208
The girl we asked about, that student
volunteer, Lena Caruso, she helped him.

34:34.272 --> 34:36.809
"Helped," that's a bit of an
understatement. She manipulated him.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.183
I'm really sorry to hear it.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.722
You don't know how sorry.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.313
Because the money is proceeds
from an illegal enterprise.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.380
The bookmaking.

34:43.447 --> 34:45.553
The DA is moving to seize it
under the RICO act.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.790
We're here to serve you with the papers.

34:48.853 --> 34:52.197
This money was a gift.
You can ask Mr. Morgan.

34:53.024 --> 34:56.597
Well, between us, Mr. Morgan isn't
making a lot of sense right now.

34:56.661 --> 35:00.234
I'm sure your lawyer can work out
a repayment schedule with the DA.

35:00.665 --> 35:03.077
But this money has been committed.

35:03.134 --> 35:04.977
Look, we're innocent victims here.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.572
You know what, to tell you the truth,

35:06.638 --> 35:09.949
I don't care if you keep the money or not.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.885
Right now, we have a problem with Mr. Morgan.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.823
He confessed to the killing.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.484
He confessed to stealing the money.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.825
But right now, his present mental state,

35:19.884 --> 35:22.057
I don't think his confession's gonna hold up.

35:22.854 --> 35:26.301
GOREN: Mr. Morgan was pretty
unstable to start with.

35:27.759 --> 35:31.172
Well, I mean, if you just have
a look at him for yourself,

35:31.229 --> 35:34.438
maybe you'll be able to
straighten him out for us.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.938
And if I straighten him out?

35:37.235 --> 35:40.910
I'm sure the DA wouldn't
have a problem with

35:40.972 --> 35:42.645
taking a look at your money problem.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.653
You can't promise that!

35:46.211 --> 35:49.420
I don't want him skipping out
on an insanity plea.

35:51.216 --> 35:53.196
I'll fix it with the DA.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.561
Just think about it.

36:03.728 --> 36:05.833
The DA said that if you
help them with Morgan,

36:05.897 --> 36:07.899
they won't push for restitution.

36:08.133 --> 36:10.636
What if we just gave them the money outright?

36:10.702 --> 36:12.978
They'll still insist on an audit.

36:17.142 --> 36:18.951
If I'm unsuccessful,

36:19.010 --> 36:22.014
if Morgan ends up more unstable than before,

36:24.082 --> 36:26.119
do I still get to keep the money?

36:27.519 --> 36:30.591
According to the DA, all
you have to do is try.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.244
Mr. Fuller.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.677
Hello, Doug.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.846
Why don't you sit here.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.687
You've been going through
a challenging time, Doug.

36:55.146 --> 36:56.921
I'd like to assist you.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.919
CARVER: Mr. Cooper, you've
explained to your client

36:59.984 --> 37:02.123
that we're prepared to accept his claim

37:02.187 --> 37:04.565
of sole responsibility for the two murders?

37:04.622 --> 37:06.602
Yes, Mr. Carver, I did.

37:06.658 --> 37:10.470
Before we proceed, we need precise details

37:10.528 --> 37:13.771
of how you committed the crimes.

37:14.432 --> 37:16.105
Do you understand?

37:20.138 --> 37:21.412
Go ahead.

37:23.441 --> 37:24.647
Well,

37:25.009 --> 37:26.955
I took my father's money and he found out.

37:27.011 --> 37:29.150
Hold on. We said precise details.

37:29.214 --> 37:31.956
The money, how did you find out about it?

37:33.084 --> 37:35.428
What's the hidden context, Doug?

37:37.222 --> 37:39.224
I'm not a competent person.

37:39.324 --> 37:41.167
I can't handle money.

37:44.162 --> 37:46.642
I was getting my finances in order.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.676
I sent away for my credit report.

37:48.733 --> 37:51.009
The bank accounts were listed on the report.

37:51.069 --> 37:53.549
Weren't you afraid your
father'd come after you?

37:55.840 --> 37:59.185
I'm still a child, I let fear control me.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.913
Yes, that's the context.

38:03.515 --> 38:06.325
I wanted to use the money for a good purpose.

38:06.417 --> 38:09.125
Something that I'm passionate about.

38:10.188 --> 38:11.792
I wasn't afraid.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.363
So, when your father came after you...

38:16.628 --> 38:21.168
I took his gun, I made Jimmy tie
up Dad and I tied up Jimmy.

38:21.466 --> 38:24.037
And then you kept them in that
motel room for 12 days?

38:24.102 --> 38:26.582
Just you, alone, and those two guys?

38:29.340 --> 38:30.751
I know this one.

38:31.075 --> 38:32.611
I'm not strong.

38:35.079 --> 38:36.717
I'm not powerful.

38:38.216 --> 38:40.059
No one listens to me.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.160
Yes, just me alone.

38:43.955 --> 38:46.561
I made them give up the rest of the money.

38:46.624 --> 38:48.831
I drove them to Dad's office.

38:53.298 --> 38:56.404
And that's when you overcame
your biggest fear.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.586
You changed your way of being.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.015
Yes.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.215
You killed your dad and
transformed your life.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.095
Yes, I did.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.893
EAMES: And you killed your
brother for the same reason.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.059
Yes.

39:18.890 --> 39:23.270
The brother who loved you,
who watched out for you.

39:24.095 --> 39:25.870
It wasn't real love.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.910
The context wasn't authentic.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.412
He watched out for me out of guilt.

39:30.635 --> 39:32.205
It's old stuff.

39:33.338 --> 39:34.976
It's in the past.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.216
You killed your dad and you let it go.

39:37.275 --> 39:38.345
Yes.

39:47.785 --> 39:49.025
Well,

39:50.121 --> 39:53.591
so then you became everything
that GraceNote promised you.

39:54.192 --> 39:56.968
I mean, like it says right
here in the brochure.

39:57.028 --> 40:00.976
Look, you became the creator
of your own destiny.

40:03.167 --> 40:05.340
That's right. That's right.

40:05.703 --> 40:10.152
Wow, look at you, you're a success story.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.822
Doug's a success story.

40:16.180 --> 40:17.750
Well, Detective...

40:17.815 --> 40:20.455
Well, look at him. He's
the master of his own fate.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.327
Put the past in the past.

40:22.387 --> 40:24.867
He transformed his way of life.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.994
He created his own destiny.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.766
I think he hit the GraceNote trifecta.

40:29.827 --> 40:31.534
Yes, Mr. Fuller?

40:32.664 --> 40:34.871
In a manner of speaking, sure.

40:35.433 --> 40:39.074
So, aren't you gonna use him
as a shining example

40:40.038 --> 40:42.848
of what can be accomplished
with GraceNote's help?

40:50.748 --> 40:52.728
I don't know about that.

40:52.917 --> 40:56.364
But don't you want your
students to follow his example?

40:58.489 --> 41:00.992
I would hope they would find another path.

41:03.528 --> 41:04.598
Oh?

41:11.269 --> 41:12.839
What do you mean?

41:14.539 --> 41:17.611
You mean murder is not the right path?

41:19.077 --> 41:21.182
I would have to say no, Detective.

41:22.013 --> 41:24.084
So, he failed.

41:25.116 --> 41:28.063
Wasn't killing his father a way
to free him from the past?

41:28.119 --> 41:29.393
Of course not.

41:29.454 --> 41:30.865
Do you hear that, Doug?

41:31.823 --> 41:33.359
You failed the course.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.869
You're the same scared loser you were,

41:35.927 --> 41:37.770
when you joined GraceNote.

41:37.829 --> 41:41.003
You... You told me if I killed him,

41:41.432 --> 41:43.571
if I killed him, I'd make the break.

41:43.634 --> 41:45.170
That's not true, Doug.

41:45.236 --> 41:46.806
That's a myth you constructed.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.646
You told me! You...

41:49.440 --> 41:52.046
I did everything you told me, Mr. Fuller.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.111
Everything?

41:53.177 --> 41:56.181
To get the money, all the
money, and to kill them.

41:56.247 --> 41:59.626
He said it would be the last
step to power, to excellence.

41:59.684 --> 42:00.822
That's what you said.

42:00.885 --> 42:02.660
GOREN: That was a lie, Doug.

42:05.890 --> 42:07.631
That was a big lie.

42:08.659 --> 42:10.297
And that's why you killed Lena.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.373
Did you? Did you do it?

42:13.431 --> 42:17.140
Of course not. She slashed her
wrists, she committed suicide.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.738
How do you know that, Mr. Fuller?

42:24.642 --> 42:26.679
Well, I can't say exactly.

42:26.844 --> 42:29.347
She knew someone at GraceNote.
They must've told me there.

42:29.414 --> 42:32.122
The only people we informed
of her death were her parents,

42:32.183 --> 42:34.629
but they weren't told how she died.

42:35.086 --> 42:39.296
Randall Fuller, you are
under arrest for murder.

42:46.864 --> 42:48.844
What did you do to my life?

42:50.601 --> 42:52.274
It wasn't much of a life to begin with.

42:52.336 --> 42:55.749
And I'm not sure the rest of yours
will be something to write home about.

43:01.913 --> 43:04.359
At least Doug learned one
of GraceNote's lessons.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.418
Taking responsibility for his actions.

43:07.485 --> 43:09.431
Something even Randall Fuller couldn't do.

43:09.487 --> 43:12.593
Well, he'll have plenty of opportunity
to learn where he's going.
