We'll find out once we get down there.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.506
E1 and I will climb down first to check.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.637
Stay here.
Contact us if something happens.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.721
Yes, sir.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.695
What is this?

04:39.487 --> 04:41.072
How can there be so many plants here?

04:52.750 --> 04:55.253
<i>There's a storage room here.</i>

05:01.759 --> 05:04.304
Why are there so many plants here?

05:05.388 --> 05:09.142
Are you sure it's okay for us
to just walk in like this?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.561
This storage wasn't on the map.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.364
Look at these stems.
How does this make any sense?

05:24.782 --> 05:25.783
Tell me about it.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.953
You don't see anything
this large back on Earth.

05:30.079 --> 05:34.000
How did they grow all this?

05:37.420 --> 05:40.506
Man, this place is amazing.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.345
It looks like there are multiple storages.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.199
Wow, isn't the mission a success
if we retrieved just one?

06:06.282 --> 06:08.117
Look at how many there are.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.707
They're all green.

06:15.875 --> 06:19.212
That means they're all
in good condition, right?

06:26.135 --> 06:27.804
They hid them all down here?

06:33.935 --> 06:35.353
It seems like the system

06:35.978 --> 06:38.439
for this facility
is separate from where we were.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.191
What is this?

06:42.360 --> 06:43.861
A lunar water capsule broke.

06:45.530 --> 06:49.534
How can all these plants grow
with this little water? It makes no sense.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.661
You're right. If we use this,

06:52.370 --> 06:54.705
we'll never have to worry
about water again.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.542
Only if we can keep it under control.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.879
-Begin the retrieval.
-Yes, Captain.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.923
-Chief Gong, search the premises.
-Yes, sir.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.758
E1, Sun.

07:05.842 --> 07:06.676
Yes, sir.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.391
How many capsules is this?

09:25.022 --> 09:28.150
Hurry. It's been neglected,
so we don't know what state it's in.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.277
Yes, Captain.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.409
Chief Gong, how does
the other storage look?

09:36.492 --> 09:37.910
The situation is similar.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.579
Most of the samples are fine.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.539
These samples are full too.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.376
We'll have to use a rover to carry these.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.670
Let's go home already, please.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.589
-What's that?
-What?

09:50.131 --> 09:51.007
Hold on.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.655
What is this?

10:15.948 --> 10:17.742
What's wrong? What's going on?

10:18.659 --> 10:19.910
Get it!

10:20.494 --> 10:21.370
Look out, E1!

10:23.914 --> 10:24.999
Wait here.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.650
Are you all right?

11:32.733 --> 11:33.984
I'm fine, sir.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.673
E1.

11:58.926 --> 11:59.802
Get back inside!

12:51.812 --> 12:53.355
Watch out!

12:57.902 --> 12:59.361
It's headed your way, E2!

13:08.537 --> 13:09.538
Captain.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.380
We have to get out of here. Now!

13:18.464 --> 13:19.465
Evacuate, now!

13:19.548 --> 13:21.342
Samples. I'll grab the samples.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.386
I will. I'll grab them.
You should go first.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.013
What about E1?

13:26.096 --> 13:27.723
-We have to get out now.
-Let's go.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.974
-Come on.
-No, wait.

13:29.058 --> 13:29.975
Let's go!

13:39.777 --> 13:42.530
<i>Warning. Thermoregulator anomaly detected.</i>

-Get over here!

14:22.111 --> 14:23.028
I need help!

14:23.612 --> 14:24.488
E2.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.866
-E2!
-We have a man down here!

14:28.284 --> 14:30.286
-We need to get him to the infirmary.
-What?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.288
Give me a hand. Lift him.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.180
There's blood in his lungs and pleurae.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.850
His heart rate is at 146,
and his BP is 75 over 43.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.060
I need to open him up. Sterilized gauze.

15:03.027 --> 15:03.986
Scalpel.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.963
His BP is way too low.

15:23.047 --> 15:26.050
Can you grab all type B blood bags
in the medical kit?

15:32.723 --> 15:33.724
We have two.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.769
That's not enough. Can you ask the others?

15:38.437 --> 15:40.064
We need more type B blood.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.650
I'm type O. You can draw my blood.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.454
Do you feel dizzy?

15:55.537 --> 15:56.789
No, I'm fine.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.708
Let me know right away
if you feel dizzy or unusual.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.709
Okay.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.727
She ripped off his arm.

16:19.353 --> 16:22.648
Then she crawled all over the ceiling.
What is this…

16:24.066 --> 16:27.861
First, some water killed people,
and then a monster shows up too.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.447
Could she be the one who killed Lee Gisu?

16:30.531 --> 16:31.365
Yes.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.366
I think so.

16:33.617 --> 16:36.120
Why is she following us around?

16:36.203 --> 16:38.914
-To kill us all?
-I think it's because of the lunar water.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.251
What?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.753
I think that's why she killed Gisu,

16:45.337 --> 16:46.672
and attacked us.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.342
She keeps showing up
where the lunar water is.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.013
She's after the same thing as us.

16:54.805 --> 16:58.308
Is it really possible
that she's a survivor?

16:58.392 --> 16:59.435
A survivor?

17:00.144 --> 17:04.023
How can she be a survivor?
A kid can't live here for five years.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.066
She was a kid, right? Wasn't she?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.776
She was. She seemed like a child

17:08.277 --> 17:11.321
who wanted to keep what's hers,
who didn't want us to take it away.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.282
It may sound odd…

17:15.826 --> 17:17.911
but that was the behavior of a child.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.873
Are you saying <i>we're</i> the intruders?

17:44.772 --> 17:45.856
Like with Gisu,

17:46.356 --> 17:49.068
she may be using only
ventilation shafts to get around.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.653
You can get anywhere you like

17:51.737 --> 17:54.364
by using shaft INP-07. You're right.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.533
We're connected to the SAA.

<i>are still unknown.</i>

18:06.502 --> 18:07.961
What about the samples?

18:15.427 --> 18:18.639
We may lose more lives at this rate.
Do we have to continue?

18:18.722 --> 18:19.807
<i>As I mentioned before,</i>

18:19.890 --> 18:23.560
<i>this operation will be a failure</i>
<i>if anybody else gets the lunar water.</i>

18:24.478 --> 18:27.773
<i>I don't care if you kill the intruder.</i>
<i>You must catch them.</i>

18:28.273 --> 18:32.486
<i>Also, make sure you retrieve</i>
<i>the lunar water that was taken.</i>

18:32.569 --> 18:33.821
It was a kid.

18:34.738 --> 18:35.572
What?

18:36.323 --> 18:38.534
The intruder seemed like a little kid.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.203
The kid was wearing a lab coat too.

18:41.787 --> 18:42.788
<i>So what?</i>

18:43.372 --> 18:45.791
Is there a possibility
that this kid's a survivor?

18:49.253 --> 18:54.675
<i>Stop trying to make things</i>
<i>more complicated than they should be.</i>

18:55.217 --> 18:57.010
<i>That's not what's important.</i>

18:57.094 --> 18:58.720
<i>Why does the kid's identity matter?</i>

18:59.221 --> 19:01.014
<i>That won't change your mission.</i>

19:04.935 --> 19:05.811
<i>I…</i>

19:07.187 --> 19:08.230
<i>sometimes</i>

19:09.314 --> 19:11.400
<i>dream of standing in the rain.</i>

19:13.193 --> 19:15.779
When I wake up from that wonderful dream,

19:17.156 --> 19:19.283
it's painful beyond words to wake up

19:20.492 --> 19:22.452
to this horrendous and sad reality.

19:22.953 --> 19:23.829
<i>We must</i>

19:25.205 --> 19:27.040
<i>make sure it rains,</i>

19:28.208 --> 19:29.209
once again,

19:30.210 --> 19:34.173
over this land, so that water
may flow abundantly on Earth.

19:34.923 --> 19:39.428
<i>We must recreate that world again.</i>

19:40.929 --> 19:43.932
<i>I'll send you backup very soon.</i>

19:45.184 --> 19:46.727
<i>Hold out just a little longer.</i>

19:57.237 --> 19:58.989
PHOTOS

20:06.914 --> 20:08.624
Is it because of Director Choi?

20:09.291 --> 20:11.877
Why can't I go back into the data storage?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.587
It's too dangerous to go back.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.049
We don't know what happened
to the lunar water after it leaked.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.759
I finally found it.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.511
I can't give up like this.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.096
It's dangerous, and that's it.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.230
I can't condone more deaths.

20:32.689 --> 20:35.359
There were 117 crew members
here at Balhae Station.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.277
None of them survived.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.613
If we take the lunar water back now,

20:40.697 --> 20:42.449
we may end up sacrificing more.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.578
It doesn't matter what you find out.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.413
The lunar water will be taken back

20:49.289 --> 20:50.415
with that kid.

20:50.499 --> 20:54.336
Then that's all the more reason
to get to the data in the data storage.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.547
Now that we know the danger
that lies in the lunar water,

20:57.631 --> 20:59.716
we need to investigate as much as we can.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.179
I don't care if you don't trust me.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.848
I'm not doing this
for personal reasons only.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.396
<i>Captain, we're ready to make a search.</i>

21:15.190 --> 21:16.900
Okay. I'll be there.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.529
I know you'll go even if I say no.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.782
Go with Doc Hong. You can't go alone.

21:25.158 --> 21:28.662
If you find anything on the lunar water
or that child, report back right away.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.039
Okay.

21:41.341 --> 21:42.718
I'm at Storage Three.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.512
<i>We're still on our way</i>
<i>to the facility hallway.</i>

21:46.138 --> 21:48.640
-Get into the shaft there and take a look.
-<i>Yes, sir.</i>

21:48.724 --> 21:50.851
I'll start searching here and move there.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.060
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

22:37.647 --> 22:38.815
It'll take a while.

22:39.566 --> 22:42.569
If it ends before we get back,
call for me. I'll come for you.

22:42.652 --> 22:43.779
Okay, Doc.

22:44.571 --> 22:45.697
Are you sure

22:46.239 --> 22:47.491
you two will be okay?

22:47.574 --> 22:49.201
What's the worst that could happen?

22:52.079 --> 22:53.330
Why? Anything to say?

22:53.830 --> 22:55.040
Do you think

22:56.541 --> 22:58.668
the lunar water research data is in there?

23:00.754 --> 23:02.089
I hope so.

23:02.589 --> 23:03.465
I really do.

23:04.883 --> 23:05.926
I'll be back.

23:06.009 --> 23:06.843
Okay.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.189
Damn, that thing is here again.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.733
Those eyes keep popping up.

24:06.319 --> 24:08.029
She must like to draw.

24:08.113 --> 24:11.825
Captain, we've arrived
at the shaft of the facility hallway.

24:12.868 --> 24:16.413
The cover is still intact.
I don't think she escaped through here.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.166
Chief.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.988
Damn it!

25:53.885 --> 25:55.053
It looks fine, right?

25:55.804 --> 25:56.680
Yes.

25:57.681 --> 25:58.557

26:42.976 --> 26:45.395
What was Dr. Song Wonkyung like?

26:55.655 --> 26:58.158
I had no idea she had been working here.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.913
I only found out after the accident
at Balhae Station was made known.

27:06.249 --> 27:08.752
I thought you two were
by yourselves without parents.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.672
How could she keep you in the dark?

27:12.756 --> 27:16.509
Back then, something else
was more important to her than me.

27:21.222 --> 27:22.557
There was this one time

27:23.642 --> 27:25.894
when she contacted me first.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.940
<i>It was right before the accident.</i>

27:31.024 --> 27:32.400
SONG WONKYUNG

27:41.117 --> 27:42.410
If I had

27:44.037 --> 27:46.748
picked up her call…

27:51.795 --> 27:53.672
would it have changed anything?

28:03.640 --> 28:05.975
Captain, we're inside
the facility hallway.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.065
This area is not on the map,

28:12.607 --> 28:13.817
but it looks like…

28:17.195 --> 28:19.322
this leads to the dorms.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.829
We'll expand our search
and check the dorms too.

28:26.329 --> 28:28.039
<i>Okay. Be careful.</i>

28:32.502 --> 28:33.795
I'm sick of this.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.325
It worked. It's open.

Wait, did someone erase everything?

29:59.172 --> 30:01.758
DATA BRICK SEARCH COMPLETE

30:02.383 --> 30:04.636
It looks like
the data was erased on purpose.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.534
Damn it.

30:28.117 --> 30:28.952
Captain.

30:30.787 --> 30:31.996
Why are you two here?

30:32.497 --> 30:33.915
What about searching the dorms?

30:33.998 --> 30:35.750
I see why people can die

30:36.584 --> 30:38.086
when they're too shocked.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.256
This doesn't seem right.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.927
It looked like this hallway
would lead us into the dorms.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.972
It feels like we've been
circling the same area.

30:49.055 --> 30:50.390
Exactly.

30:50.473 --> 30:52.767
It's like playing tag.

30:53.351 --> 30:56.479
She knows exactly where we are
and always manages to avoid us.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.190
She knows her way around here
much better than we do.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.534
Who could have deleted this?

31:09.617 --> 31:11.160
Why? For what reason?

31:45.278 --> 31:46.988
I told you to call me.

31:48.990 --> 31:52.035
No, I'm fine.
What happened to the research data?

31:52.118 --> 31:53.661
Why did you take them out?

31:55.038 --> 31:57.665
Aren't you supposed to join the search?

31:58.541 --> 31:59.667
Oh, you haven't heard.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.545
We decided to stop the search
and meet at the command center.

32:03.379 --> 32:06.215
There could be a safety issue
if we leave these here.

32:06.299 --> 32:09.844
So I'll move the samples
back to the command center.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.054
Why?

32:12.555 --> 32:14.057
Was it Captain Han's order?

32:16.225 --> 32:17.852
You said

32:18.478 --> 32:21.898
that monster seems to be
after the lunar water like we are.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.442
Don't worry.

32:24.525 --> 32:28.112
We're only being careful,
just in case anything happens.

32:29.572 --> 32:30.448
No.

32:31.532 --> 32:33.826
I make the decisions
when it comes to the samples.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.913
We'll keep the lunar water
and the kit here.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.628
All right, then.

32:45.171 --> 32:47.423
Let me know right away
if anything happens.

32:55.723 --> 32:58.810
Did we miss a passage
on the holographic map?

32:59.310 --> 33:02.480
I'm sorry. I'll check once again
when we get to the command center.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.440
But that girl…

33:05.191 --> 33:06.109
That monster?

33:06.776 --> 33:09.570
What do we call her? Whatever.
But why is she so important?

33:09.654 --> 33:11.948
We should head home
now that we found the sample.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.441
<i>Captain.</i>

33:46.524 --> 33:48.776
<i>Captain, she's here.</i>

33:49.610 --> 33:50.695
What do you mean?

33:51.279 --> 33:52.697
Doc Hong, respond.

33:59.746 --> 34:00.621
Captain.

34:21.684 --> 34:22.560
Wait!

34:47.752 --> 34:49.378
Dr. Song, step back.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.255
One second.

34:51.839 --> 34:53.549
Don't get near me. Give me a second.

38:43.404 --> 38:44.739
