00:37.968 --> 00:39.168
Disappeared.

00:39.203 --> 00:41.037
We're guessing he's
gone off his meds.

00:41.071 --> 00:42.538
His meds?

00:42.573 --> 00:44.874
He's supposed
to co-lead a presentation

00:44.908 --> 00:47.210
For the department of defense on
this bio-fuels project tomorrow.

00:47.244 --> 00:50.346
What's your tomorrow look like?
Do you have a suit?

00:50.380 --> 00:52.815
So this is how
you use your gift.

00:58.121 --> 00:59.355
I'm sorry, do I know you?

00:59.389 --> 01:01.624
So this is how
you use your gift.

01:05.462 --> 01:07.296
She looked at me and she said,

01:07.331 --> 01:09.498
"is this how you use your gift?"

01:09.533 --> 01:11.334
I dreamt about
her, too.

01:11.368 --> 01:14.337
<i>Devalos has just found
another family-- blood gone,</i>

01:14.371 --> 01:15.471
Posed for pictures.

01:15.505 --> 01:17.473
He wants me to go
take a look.

01:18.775 --> 01:20.776
He's getting away!

01:20.811 --> 01:22.945
Stop him!

01:22.980 --> 01:24.614
Turn him around.

01:27.117 --> 01:29.051
You dream things,
don't you?

01:29.086 --> 01:31.520
I'm not telling you anything.

01:31.555 --> 01:33.589
If you change your mind.

01:39.263 --> 01:40.596
<i>Jennifer, is that you?</i>

01:40.631 --> 01:43.199
Stay where there are people.
I'll come and get you.

02:00.751 --> 02:03.386
Now tell me what happened.

02:07.057 --> 02:12.495
I, uh... I had a dream
he was coming after me.

02:13.997 --> 02:16.332
You were right, I do dream.

02:18.135 --> 02:21.070
The thing is, I didn't realize
the things I saw in my sleep

02:21.104 --> 02:23.005
Were actually happening.

02:24.508 --> 02:26.909
Not until I went inside
the prescott house

02:26.943 --> 02:30.212
And saw them all
sitting there-- dead.

02:30.247 --> 02:32.114
It's okay.

02:32.149 --> 02:34.950
We're not going to let
anything happen to you.

02:36.453 --> 02:39.622
So these dreams--
did you see him?

02:39.656 --> 02:42.024
Can you tell me anything
about him?

02:42.959 --> 02:45.261
I never see him.

02:45.295 --> 02:50.066
<i>Can't even really be sure
he is a him.</i>

02:50.100 --> 02:52.535
<i>Although his hands
look like man's hands.</i>

02:52.569 --> 02:53.669
<i>And he's white.</i>

02:53.704 --> 02:57.106
I know he's white.

02:57.174 --> 02:59.241
I only see what he sees.

02:59.276 --> 03:01.110
I only see through
his eyes.

03:02.279 --> 03:05.247
You make it sound like it's been
going on for a while.

03:05.282 --> 03:09.318
Just since the accident.

03:09.353 --> 03:14.557
<i>Just before I turned 16,
I was with my parents.</i>

03:14.591 --> 03:17.460
<i>We were coming back home
from college night.</i>

03:17.494 --> 03:19.061
<i>I was sleeping in the back,</i>

03:19.096 --> 03:21.497
<i>So I didn't have
a seat belt on.</i>

03:21.531 --> 03:24.433
<i>So when the car slammed on
its brakes in front of us,</i>

03:24.468 --> 03:26.936
<i>I didn't even see anything.</i>

03:26.970 --> 03:28.838
<i>They say I never woke up.</i>

03:28.872 --> 03:32.842
<i>Just got thrown through that
window and onto the highway.</i>

03:32.876 --> 03:38.180
But I actually remember
flying past my parents...

03:40.050 --> 03:42.918
Kind of knowing
I'd never see them again.

03:44.755 --> 03:47.957
They told me in the hospital
that that wasn't possible.

03:47.991 --> 03:51.160
<i>But I still remember it.</i>

03:57.367 --> 03:59.869
And that's when
the dreams started?

03:59.903 --> 04:01.971
In the hospital, yeah.

04:02.005 --> 04:04.740
Do you want to tell
me about your dreams?

04:06.410 --> 04:11.781
Okay, but, uh, could we get
some food first?

04:13.517 --> 04:17.853
At first it was just woods--
walking through woods.

04:17.887 --> 04:18.988
Feet.

04:19.022 --> 04:20.656
I think it must have
been near flagstaff.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.758
And then it was sitting
in woods and waiting--

04:22.793 --> 04:23.993
Lots of waiting.

04:26.797 --> 04:29.298
And then...

04:39.476 --> 04:42.478
It was hard-- watching it die.

04:42.512 --> 04:44.079
I love animals.

04:45.982 --> 04:48.818
And then it got weirder.

04:48.852 --> 04:51.954
He started draining
the blood out of it.

05:01.131 --> 05:02.798
At first I didn't think
much of it.

05:02.833 --> 05:05.534
My dad used to hunt, so I knew
all about bleeding your kill

05:05.569 --> 05:07.403
To keep the meat.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.505
It was the posing
that creeped me out.

05:13.844 --> 05:16.245
He seemed to like
taking picture of it.

05:16.279 --> 05:17.379
All shriveled up.

05:17.414 --> 05:19.482
And then he started
taking it places.

05:26.656 --> 05:29.492
It's almost 6:00 in the morning.

05:29.526 --> 05:31.594
You have to be exhausted.

05:31.628 --> 05:33.262
I know I am.

05:33.296 --> 05:35.631
So how does this work?

05:35.665 --> 05:37.633
I can't go back out there.

05:37.667 --> 05:41.670
He knows who I am
and he wants to kill me.

05:43.974 --> 05:47.476
You're not going to take me
back to jail, are you?

05:47.511 --> 05:50.679
Marie, honey, I need you
to come out of there.

05:50.714 --> 05:53.082
No! I'm never coming
out of here!

05:53.116 --> 05:54.517
Not now, not ever!

05:54.551 --> 05:56.986
Marie, everybody has got
to get to school.

05:57.020 --> 06:00.055
Daddy has got a big meeting
with the department of defense,

06:00.090 --> 06:01.957
So I really need you
to unlock this door!

06:01.992 --> 06:03.325
No, I want mommy!

06:03.360 --> 06:04.660
Mommy is not here.

06:04.694 --> 06:06.929
Mommy!
Open this door,
young lady!

06:06.963 --> 06:09.031
The problem is, you've
messed with forces

06:09.065 --> 06:10.733
No man
should ever mess with--

06:10.767 --> 06:12.301
She lost her tooth.

06:12.335 --> 06:13.636
When she looked under her pillow

06:13.670 --> 06:15.738
And saw that there wasn't
any money there...

06:15.772 --> 06:18.207
That's a big screwup.

06:18.241 --> 06:20.910
She lost her tooth
in the middle of the night?

06:20.944 --> 06:22.511
Well... How am I supposed
to get in there?

06:22.546 --> 06:24.079
How am I supposed
to even know?

06:24.114 --> 06:26.382
Hey, you're the parent.

06:26.416 --> 06:28.584
Just go in there
and coax her out.

06:28.618 --> 06:31.287
I'll sneak in, I'll slip
a dollar under her pillow.

06:31.321 --> 06:32.555
What?

06:32.589 --> 06:33.856
I can't do that.

06:33.890 --> 06:35.991
I'm a kid. That would
make me a traitor.

06:36.026 --> 06:37.259
Oh...
Mom still not here?

06:37.294 --> 06:38.794
No. I don't know
what to tell you, ariel.

06:38.828 --> 06:41.030
She left in the middle of the
night to do something for work.

06:41.064 --> 06:42.331
I got a text--
I know she's okay,

06:42.365 --> 06:43.799
But I have no idea
when she's coming back.

06:43.833 --> 06:45.067
How am I supposed
to get to school

06:45.101 --> 06:46.335
If I can't use her car?

06:46.369 --> 06:47.703
I'm gonna take you.
I'm gonna take everybody.

06:47.737 --> 06:49.572
As soon as I get marie
out of her room.

06:51.207 --> 06:54.310
All right, fine.
You got a buck?

06:56.279 --> 06:58.480
Here.

06:58.515 --> 07:00.816
All right,
I'm goin' in.

07:00.850 --> 07:02.318
Marie, it's bridge.

07:02.352 --> 07:04.053
Open up or else
I'm telling mom

07:04.087 --> 07:06.555
Where you hide
your dirty underwear.

07:07.490 --> 07:08.757
That was easy.

07:08.792 --> 07:10.659
I'm here.

07:10.694 --> 07:14.296
Finally. I have to leave
for school right now...

07:18.635 --> 07:20.970
Joe, ariel, say hi.

07:21.004 --> 07:21.837
This is jennifer.

07:21.871 --> 07:23.339
Wow. Dumb tooth fairy

07:23.373 --> 07:26.308
Left a dollar under
my pillow when it was
supposed to be for...

07:26.343 --> 07:28.410
Hey!

07:28.445 --> 07:31.480
You're the girl in
my dream who tried
to kill herself.

08:23.917 --> 08:26.185
<i>Are you serious about this?
She needs our help.</i>

08:26.220 --> 08:27.654
It'll probably just be
a couple days.

08:27.688 --> 08:29.122
If I understand
everything you've told me,

08:29.156 --> 08:31.991
This girl's being pursued
by a serial killer--

08:32.025 --> 08:34.126
A serial killer who
targets families.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.895
That's why I called my boss.

08:35.929 --> 08:37.764
He's arranging to have
a police car

08:37.798 --> 08:40.866
Posted outside of our house
as long as jennifer's here.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.035
Oh, okay then, well, it will
just be like normal.

08:43.070 --> 08:44.937
Allison, come on,
you haven't slept.

08:44.972 --> 08:47.106
You're not thinking clearly.
This girl is a criminal.

08:47.141 --> 08:48.408
She's an orphan.

08:48.442 --> 08:50.009
She stole some food to eat.

08:50.044 --> 08:52.011
Okay, be that as it may,
there has to be another option.

08:52.046 --> 08:54.814
Look, this is the only
protective custody

08:54.848 --> 08:56.249
I could get her
to agree to.

08:56.283 --> 08:58.051
I mean, think about it--
she doesn't have a home.

08:58.085 --> 08:59.752
She doesn't want
to go back to jail.

08:59.787 --> 09:00.887
She's frightened.

09:00.921 --> 09:02.522
Well, so are your children.

09:02.556 --> 09:04.924
They dreamt about her
killing herself.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.359
You dreamt about
her killing herself.

09:06.393 --> 09:09.262
That is not something
I want my daughters around.

09:09.296 --> 09:11.631
That is not something
I want my daughters exposed to.

09:11.665 --> 09:13.733
Now can you guarantee me
that she is stable?

09:13.767 --> 09:15.601
Huh? Can you?

09:15.636 --> 09:17.670
Can you guarantee me
that one of our girls

09:17.705 --> 09:19.706
Isn't going to come home
and find this kid

09:19.740 --> 09:20.873
Swinging from a rafter?

09:20.908 --> 09:23.943
Your point is taken.

09:23.977 --> 09:25.478
Listen, I promise you,

09:25.512 --> 09:28.114
I will not let this girl
out of my sight

09:28.148 --> 09:30.283
As long as she
is here, okay?

09:30.317 --> 09:32.085
I gotta go.
Okay, look, I know.

09:32.119 --> 09:34.053
I know you have a big day.

09:34.088 --> 09:36.522
And I know I haven't
made it any easier.

09:38.358 --> 09:40.193
Good luck.

09:48.335 --> 09:51.003
Well, she's as ready
as she's ever going to be.

09:51.905 --> 09:54.540
And you're sure she understands?

09:54.574 --> 09:56.608
I'm not agreeing
to anything up front,

09:56.643 --> 09:58.577
But if she gives us something
we can use,

09:58.611 --> 10:00.279
I'll withdraw the breaking
and entering charges.

10:00.313 --> 10:03.082
I explained it all to her.

10:03.116 --> 10:05.517
And she knows that if we sense
that she's being

10:05.552 --> 10:08.520
Less than forthcoming, I reserve
the right to re-file?

10:08.555 --> 10:10.356
Well, she's a little girl.

10:10.390 --> 10:12.858
But she knows she's giving
something to get something.

10:12.892 --> 10:14.727
You two get some sleep?

10:14.761 --> 10:16.395
Well, some.

10:16.429 --> 10:18.163
Oh, thanks for sending
the car.

10:18.198 --> 10:20.065
<i>You have to understand--</i>

10:20.100 --> 10:23.268
Up until I actually saw that
family sitting in their tv room,

10:23.303 --> 10:26.038
I just thought it was
a picture-taking thing.

10:26.072 --> 10:28.240
What do you mean?

10:28.274 --> 10:30.909
When I would dream, it would be
about their picture being taken.

10:30.944 --> 10:32.845
<i>He was just always taking
pictures of them,</i>

10:32.879 --> 10:35.881
<i>Of their house.</i>

10:35.915 --> 10:38.050
I never made the connection
to the elk.

10:39.819 --> 10:42.121
Then it was alarm systems.

10:42.155 --> 10:45.457
<i>I realize now he was trying
to learn everything he could</i>

10:45.492 --> 10:46.992
<i>About alarm systems.</i>

10:47.026 --> 10:50.329
And then one night
I was sleeping

10:50.363 --> 10:53.899
Under these high school
bleachers, and I had a dream.

10:53.933 --> 10:56.402
<i>But this dream was different.</i>

10:56.436 --> 10:59.638
<i>There's no camera,
no lens to look through.</i>

11:00.473 --> 11:02.808
<i>He seemed to get
into the house.</i>

11:04.844 --> 11:07.246
And I woke up,
and I was so hungry,

11:07.280 --> 11:09.281
And all my friend
had found to eat

11:09.315 --> 11:11.717
Was someone else's garbage.

11:11.751 --> 11:15.154
So I thought, let's just
go over there, take a look.

11:15.188 --> 11:17.022
So for you, this
was just about
helping yourself

11:17.056 --> 11:18.190
To the contents
of their kitchen.

11:18.224 --> 11:19.925
Okay.

11:19.959 --> 11:21.493
So what happened then?

11:21.528 --> 11:24.930
And then I heard the tv.

11:24.964 --> 11:26.832
David...

11:26.866 --> 11:30.202
<i>So I went into the tv room,
and I saw them.</i>

11:34.240 --> 11:35.807
And what did
you think?

11:35.841 --> 11:37.842
I didn't know what to think.

11:37.877 --> 11:39.777
I didn't know what they were.

11:39.812 --> 11:42.881
I thought they were people,
and I thought they were alive

11:42.915 --> 11:44.382
Or had once been alive.

11:44.416 --> 11:45.783
I just...

11:45.818 --> 11:48.219
I thought I needed
to get out of there,

11:48.254 --> 11:49.487
So I did.

11:49.522 --> 11:51.356
And what about
the second family?

11:51.390 --> 11:52.590
What about them?

11:52.625 --> 11:55.059
Did you dream about him
taking pictures of them?

11:55.094 --> 11:56.928
Yeah. And their house.

11:58.631 --> 12:02.400
But I never saw an address,
or I would have warned them;

12:02.434 --> 12:04.035
I would've called someone.

12:04.069 --> 12:05.737
You're sure about that?

12:07.071 --> 12:09.706
But the night of
the murders--

12:09.740 --> 12:11.741
That night--
you did see an address?

12:11.776 --> 12:12.909
Yeah.

12:12.944 --> 12:15.378
And you saw someone
defeat the alarm system

12:15.413 --> 12:16.713
And break in?

12:16.747 --> 12:17.948
Yeah.

12:17.982 --> 12:19.416
But you didn't call anyone then.

12:19.450 --> 12:22.152
It's okay.

12:22.186 --> 12:25.222
Just tell them the truth.

12:27.291 --> 12:29.192
I didn't call anyone.

12:29.227 --> 12:32.095
I just went over there
hoping to find food.

12:32.129 --> 12:35.432
<i>I got in there
and the cops showed up,</i>

12:35.466 --> 12:36.700
<i>So I hid in that closet.</i>

12:36.734 --> 12:37.968
<i>But in all the time</i>

12:38.002 --> 12:39.836
That you've been
dreaming these dreams,

12:39.871 --> 12:43.073
Seeing things
through this man's eyes,

12:43.107 --> 12:46.276
You've... Never seen his face?

12:46.310 --> 12:48.345
Never seen his license plate,

12:48.379 --> 12:50.046
His home address...?

12:50.081 --> 12:53.984
If there's anything else
you could give us...

12:55.253 --> 12:56.653
He, uh,

12:56.687 --> 12:58.221
He didn't just
take pictures.

12:58.256 --> 13:02.292
He liked to draw, too.

13:04.161 --> 13:08.365
Yeah. Uh, sometimes when
I'm not doing anything...

13:08.399 --> 13:10.000
I draw it, too.

13:10.034 --> 13:12.035
I don't even think about it,

13:12.069 --> 13:14.938
I just look down and it's there.

13:18.276 --> 13:20.377
I don't know, allison...

13:20.411 --> 13:22.512
Caucasian,
takes pictures,

13:22.547 --> 13:24.681
Knows his way around
an alarm system.

13:24.715 --> 13:26.683
Oh, yeah,
and loves clowns.

13:26.717 --> 13:29.119
<i>Not exactly
the da vinci ce.</i>

13:29.153 --> 13:30.587
Lee, you tell me,

13:30.621 --> 13:33.223
Are we any further ahead
than we were this morning?

13:33.257 --> 13:34.558
This morning we had nothing.

13:34.592 --> 13:37.427
Now at least
we have next to nothing.

13:37.461 --> 13:39.896
I guess this alarm thing's
a good place to start.

13:39.931 --> 13:41.064
If she's telling the truth.

13:41.098 --> 13:42.766
If she's telling the truth.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.101
What do you mean,
if she's telling the truth?

13:45.136 --> 13:46.202
Come on, allison,

13:46.237 --> 13:47.604
She's basically a street kid.

13:47.638 --> 13:49.439
Take it from me,
they learn fast

13:49.473 --> 13:51.007
How to say what they need

13:51.042 --> 13:52.442
To keep their
head above water.

13:52.476 --> 13:54.678
I'm sorry, you're wrong.
You're both wrong.

13:54.712 --> 13:56.580
How can you be so sure?

13:56.614 --> 13:59.516
Your dreams, you've been
dreaming them all your life,

13:59.550 --> 14:00.617
Haven't you?

14:00.651 --> 14:02.185
Yeah. So?

14:03.119 --> 14:06.088
Didn't you just
tell me that this girl

14:06.122 --> 14:08.357
<i>Just started dreaming?</i>

14:08.391 --> 14:09.758
Don't you find that
awfully convenient?

14:09.793 --> 14:11.594
Well, I-I'm sorry
I can't explain it.

14:11.628 --> 14:13.262
I don't know how to prove it.

14:13.296 --> 14:15.231
But I can tell you
I believe her.

14:15.265 --> 14:17.933
I believe that this girl
has a direct line

14:17.968 --> 14:19.869
To this guy's head--
which means

14:19.903 --> 14:21.470
She's not gonna
stop dreaming.

14:21.505 --> 14:24.039
And he is not gonna stop
doing what he is doing.

14:24.074 --> 14:25.708
Which means
at some point in time,

14:25.742 --> 14:29.078
She is probably gonna see
something that's of value to us.

14:29.112 --> 14:31.280
Well, I hope
you're right.

14:31.314 --> 14:34.617
In the meantime,
this girl is in your home.

14:34.651 --> 14:36.018
Be careful.

14:36.052 --> 14:39.955
I'll-I'll tell my husband
that you said that.

14:39.990 --> 14:42.157
<i>The paradox of aviation</i>

14:42.192 --> 14:44.727
Is that you need enough fuel
to power your aircraft

14:44.761 --> 14:48.063
And provide lift
for the manpower to fly it,

14:48.098 --> 14:52.401
<i>Your payload and the weight
of the fuel itself.</i>

14:52.435 --> 14:55.671
This is why it's long been
a dream of aviators everywhere

14:55.705 --> 14:58.941
To find a fuel that has
little or no weight.

14:58.975 --> 15:01.410
Colonel reidy,
ladies and gentlemen,

15:01.444 --> 15:04.547
We believe we have come up
with a breakthrough,

15:04.581 --> 15:08.050
Next-generation,
synthetic fuel hybrid,

15:08.084 --> 15:09.985
Whose weight is one-eighth

15:10.020 --> 15:11.921
That of conventional fuels.

15:11.955 --> 15:13.355
Now, the key to this...

15:13.390 --> 15:15.758
This amazing breakthrough

15:15.792 --> 15:18.060
Is the ability to harness

15:18.094 --> 15:21.864
The innate energy found in
the latest synthetic polymers.

15:23.198 --> 15:25.733
Which
synthetic polymers?

15:27.536 --> 15:29.370
Excuse me?

15:29.404 --> 15:31.672
It's a simple question.

15:31.707 --> 15:33.908
maybe I'll give you

15:33.942 --> 15:36.410
The first letter and
you can try to guess.

15:36.445 --> 15:38.946
Who is this man?
How did he get in here?

15:38.981 --> 15:40.948
I'm a genius;
I have clearance.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.016
He's with me.

15:42.050 --> 15:43.150
Joe, come on.

15:43.185 --> 15:44.785
Starts with a "p,"

15:44.820 --> 15:46.721
Rhymes with "bismaleimides."

15:46.755 --> 15:47.755
Keith.

15:47.789 --> 15:49.624
Joey, baby,
you can do this.

15:49.658 --> 15:53.060
Keith, I need you
to turn around and
leave this room.
No, dan.

15:53.095 --> 15:54.795
This is a simple question.

15:54.830 --> 15:58.299
Right? If joe would...
Would do his homework,

15:58.333 --> 16:00.668
If joe would have
applied himself...

16:00.702 --> 16:02.503
I want to know
who this man is.

16:02.537 --> 16:04.171
Who am I?

16:04.206 --> 16:07.842
I am thomas edison.

16:07.876 --> 16:09.644
I am madame curie.

16:09.678 --> 16:13.180
I am steve "the man" jobs!

16:13.215 --> 16:14.882
And this is my apple!

16:14.917 --> 16:17.585
This is my radium!

16:17.619 --> 16:18.786
This is my lightbulb!

16:18.820 --> 16:20.588
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let

16:20.622 --> 16:23.391
Somebody else
tell you about it!

16:30.933 --> 16:34.635
You know, if you'd rather
I stay someplace else...

16:34.670 --> 16:37.171
Well..

16:37.205 --> 16:39.607
Why would you say that?

16:39.641 --> 16:41.709
Why would you think that?

16:41.743 --> 16:44.345
I'm just saying
I'm pretty self-sufficient.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.414
I'd find a place to sleep.

16:46.448 --> 16:49.984
Besides, I don't
think that I impressed
your friends too much.

16:50.018 --> 16:52.553
It's not like I had
a lot to offer.

16:54.289 --> 16:57.158
And I think they had
a hard time understanding

16:57.192 --> 17:00.194
How I could go into that house,

17:00.228 --> 17:03.030
See those dead people...

17:03.065 --> 17:06.200
And steal their food.

17:07.636 --> 17:11.771
I know that you have been
through a lot in your life.

17:12.840 --> 17:16.844
We all know that you
have been through a lot.

17:16.877 --> 17:18.779
In your life.

17:18.814 --> 17:20.114
Okay?

17:21.349 --> 17:22.583
Hey.

17:22.617 --> 17:25.786
Come on, let's get you
some dinner, okay?

17:55.548 --> 17:58.651
Hey, are you in there?

17:58.685 --> 18:00.853
No.

18:01.755 --> 18:02.821
You okay?

18:02.856 --> 18:04.089
I don't know, al.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.392
What can I
do for you?

18:06.426 --> 18:09.561
I'm just looking for my husband.

18:09.596 --> 18:11.463
Okay, I lied;
I'm in here.

18:11.498 --> 18:13.732
Go back to bed.
What are you doing?

18:13.767 --> 18:15.901
I can't sleep,
and I can't wander
around the house

18:15.936 --> 18:17.836
'cause there's a stranger
sleeping in the living room.

18:17.871 --> 18:20.072
How many times do you want me
to apologize for that?

18:20.106 --> 18:21.407
I'm not asking
you to apologize.

18:21.441 --> 18:23.742
I'm just saying,
I had the...

18:23.777 --> 18:27.212
The most not-of-this-earth
professional experience
of my life today,

18:27.247 --> 18:30.783
And... And it just
keeps running over and
over again in my head.

18:30.817 --> 18:32.418
Okay. Come on,
you're home now.

18:32.452 --> 18:34.653
Come on, come on,
come back to bed.

18:34.688 --> 18:36.522
I'm trying to sleep,
but I can't,

18:36.556 --> 18:38.624
Not without hearing
that maniac

18:38.658 --> 18:41.694
Call from the back of the room
that he's-he's albert einstein

18:41.728 --> 18:43.629
Or niels bohr
or nicolaus copernicus

18:43.663 --> 18:46.065
Or whoever the hell
he's claiming to be.

18:46.099 --> 18:48.133
All right, take a deep breath.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.936
I mean, he's-he's-he's
full-blown crazy.

18:50.971 --> 18:52.638
He's out of his mind.

18:52.672 --> 18:54.206
That's the scary part.

18:55.340 --> 18:58.443
You're standing in a room
with military guys
and government guys,

18:58.477 --> 19:01.479
And you're trying to get them
to take a leap of faith

19:01.513 --> 19:04.348
And-and invest in
this thing that doesn't
really even exist yet,

19:04.383 --> 19:05.850
And they want to believe.

19:05.884 --> 19:09.220
And then this crazy
guy shows up and says
that he invented it,

19:09.254 --> 19:10.555
And he did.

19:10.589 --> 19:13.124
And then all of a sudden,
everybody in the room realizes

19:13.158 --> 19:14.859
They're in league
with a crazy man.

19:14.893 --> 19:17.762
It's just not what I anticipated
when I woke up this morning.

19:17.796 --> 19:19.397
Shh...

19:20.899 --> 19:22.033
Shh.

19:22.067 --> 19:23.768
Take a breath.

19:23.802 --> 19:25.069
Shh.

19:26.338 --> 19:30.141
Do you really think that this
is gonna make a difference?

19:30.175 --> 19:32.877
Close your eyes.

19:32.911 --> 19:35.079
Shh.

19:35.114 --> 19:37.615
You may be on
to something.

19:47.392 --> 19:49.360
You all right?

19:49.394 --> 19:51.496
I saw you fall.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.768
Ew, you licked it.

19:56.802 --> 19:58.469
It's only blood.

19:58.504 --> 20:00.705
You won't miss it.

20:00.739 --> 20:02.574
Here, put
that on it.

20:02.608 --> 20:04.542
Press it.

20:05.578 --> 20:07.846
It still hurts.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.882
It stopped bleeding,
but it still hurts.

20:10.916 --> 20:13.084
That'll go away.

20:13.118 --> 20:15.920
Here, for the tears.

20:15.955 --> 20:18.523
Thank you.

20:18.557 --> 20:20.425
That's a nice camera.

20:20.459 --> 20:22.894
What are you taking
a picture of?

20:22.928 --> 20:24.696
People.

20:24.730 --> 20:26.231
You.

20:26.265 --> 20:28.600
Those folks
over there.

20:28.634 --> 20:31.803
They're your
parents, right?

20:31.837 --> 20:34.539
It's my little
brother's birthday.

20:34.573 --> 20:36.507
We're here for a picnic.

20:36.542 --> 20:38.643
Nice balloon.

20:42.181 --> 20:45.383
Well, you tell
your little brother

20:45.417 --> 20:48.686
Happy birthday from me.

20:48.721 --> 20:50.822
And who knows,

20:50.856 --> 20:53.458
Maybe I'll see you
again sometime.

21:04.899 --> 21:05.932
I don't know.

21:05.966 --> 21:08.568
I mean, yeah, yeah,
it looks like him.

21:08.602 --> 21:10.570
It's just hard to tell.

21:10.604 --> 21:12.405
I saw his face
in a balloon.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.307
It's just hard
to say for sure.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.242
But the essence
is there, right?

21:16.277 --> 21:18.378
The shaved head,
the beard...?

21:18.412 --> 21:20.280
Yeah.
All right,

21:20.314 --> 21:21.948
I'll get this
distributed internally,

21:21.982 --> 21:25.518
See if we can't narrow down
who this guy is.

21:25.553 --> 21:28.021
Uh... Maybe...

21:28.055 --> 21:30.390
We should mention the accent.
What accent?

21:30.424 --> 21:32.058
You never
mentioned
an accent.

21:32.093 --> 21:35.061
Well, last night was
the first time I ever
heard him talk.

21:35.096 --> 21:36.796
What kind of accent?

21:36.831 --> 21:39.532
It was kind of southern,
kindf... Weird.

21:39.567 --> 21:42.869
Yeah, I'd say
we should include that.

21:50.678 --> 21:52.212
Joe. Good you're here.

21:52.246 --> 21:55.148
Listen, would you, uh, mind
joining us in here for a second?

21:55.182 --> 21:56.382
Keith and I?

22:03.124 --> 22:06.292
Please, joe,
take a seat.

22:21.308 --> 22:23.243
I'm sorry.

22:26.479 --> 22:29.147
What? Something
you wanted to add?

22:31.918 --> 22:34.887
Okay, now, we've got
a situation here, gentlemen.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.923
I had breakfast this morning
with our friends from the dod,

22:37.957 --> 22:41.093
And I offered a formal apology
to colonel reidy.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.195
I explained to him
that keith here

22:43.229 --> 22:45.397
Was struggling with...

22:45.431 --> 22:46.798
Several crises

22:46.833 --> 22:49.034
In his personal life,
that he showed up

22:49.068 --> 22:50.669
Yesterday, despite
being ordered not to,

22:50.703 --> 22:52.271
That he was under
the influence

22:52.305 --> 22:55.507
Of intense antidepressants
and antipsychotics.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.477
Now, the colonel offered
that he's had some experience

22:58.511 --> 23:01.046
With family members who
have been highly medicated,

23:01.080 --> 23:04.216
And he offered us
the opportunity to return.

23:04.250 --> 23:07.486
With millions of dollars
invested in research

23:07.520 --> 23:09.454
And almost
a hundred jobs at stake,

23:09.489 --> 23:11.423
I, of course,
accepted his offer.

23:11.457 --> 23:13.659
So...

23:13.693 --> 23:16.595
I need the two of you
to work together,

23:16.629 --> 23:19.531
To come up with a
joint presentation,

23:19.565 --> 23:20.766
One that you're both
comfortable with.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.601
Now, I've made it
very clear to keith here

23:22.635 --> 23:26.405
That I really don't give a damn
who came up with the science

23:26.472 --> 23:27.973
That makes this fuel possible.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.341
I own it.

23:29.375 --> 23:32.911
So I want the two of you
to go back in there and be

23:32.946 --> 23:35.714
The lovebirds that
I know you're both
capable of being,

23:35.748 --> 23:37.616
And I want you
to sell it.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.085
I want you to sell it
like our lives depend on it.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.587
Because frankly... They do.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.658
With all due respect,
I'd rather not.

23:46.693 --> 23:49.294
With all due respect,
I don't care.

23:49.329 --> 23:51.496
Believe me, I'd send keith
back in there by himself

23:51.531 --> 23:54.199
If I could, but the chance
of him being seen

23:54.233 --> 23:56.401
As anything other than
a lunatic at this point

23:56.436 --> 23:57.836
Was completely
destroyed yesterday.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.237
He is a lunatic.

23:59.272 --> 24:00.806
He's your lunatic.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.274
Count me out.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.745
Hey, joe.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.747
I'm not a lunatic.

24:14.354 --> 24:16.688
I have a bipolar disorder.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.423
Okay?

24:23.361 --> 24:24.762
So...

24:24.796 --> 24:29.633
Usually I can keep it
under control with medication.

24:29.668 --> 24:31.702
Uh, the problem is,

24:31.736 --> 24:34.905
The pills I take,
they-they slow me down,

24:34.940 --> 24:37.241
They dull my thinking.

24:37.275 --> 24:39.476
And normally,
that wouldn't be a problem--

24:39.511 --> 24:43.647
You know, I'm pretty smart,
even on medication...

24:43.682 --> 24:46.917
But this-this light fuel thing

24:46.952 --> 24:49.153
Just...

24:49.187 --> 24:52.790
I knew that the only chance
that I had of cracking it

24:52.824 --> 24:56.327
Was if I took myself
off the meds.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.098
So I did.
Not withstanding

25:01.132 --> 25:03.534
My candor with him this morning,
the dod is unaware

25:03.568 --> 25:05.669
Of the chronic nature
of keith's condition.

25:05.704 --> 25:09.206
Believe me... They'd never
continue to give him

25:09.241 --> 25:12.509
The necessary security
clearances if they were.

25:14.379 --> 25:16.847
I need someone--

25:16.881 --> 25:17.982
We...

25:18.016 --> 25:19.883
Need someone
to help us.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.285
To help keith...

25:24.155 --> 25:26.290
...Put this over.

25:26.324 --> 25:29.393
It would mean
a great deal to me.

25:29.427 --> 25:31.161
It would mean a great
deal to the company.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.330
As a matter of fact,
I would like to draw up

25:33.365 --> 25:34.865
A new contract for you
this afternoon,

25:34.899 --> 25:38.936
One that's more commensurate
with your new level of...

25:38.970 --> 25:40.337
Responsibility.

25:42.140 --> 25:45.509
So, what do you say, Joe?

25:48.779 --> 25:50.513
Whatcha gonna buy me?

25:52.649 --> 25:54.550
That's not funny.

25:54.585 --> 25:56.619
Come on, honey,
it's a raise!

25:56.653 --> 25:57.820
It's a promotion.

25:57.854 --> 25:59.488
It's supposed to
make you happy.

25:59.523 --> 26:01.190
Hey, I'm happy
about the money.

26:01.224 --> 26:02.658
I just don't
like the idea

26:02.693 --> 26:05.294
Of being paid to be this...
This guy's chaperone.

26:05.329 --> 26:07.163
Which is what I am.

26:07.197 --> 26:09.398
Oh, come on, there's
more to it than that.

26:09.433 --> 26:12.335
Don't worry, okay?
I'm not gonna turn
down the money.

26:12.369 --> 26:16.405
I can't; not with a new
mouth to feed around here.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.407
Oh, you should have
seen her today--

26:18.442 --> 26:21.477
Working with the police,
spending time with people,

26:21.511 --> 26:23.079
Having lunch with everybody.

26:23.113 --> 26:26.916
I mean, I actually
sort of see her come out
of herself a little bit.

26:33.790 --> 26:36.425
Oh, well, that's nice, allison.

26:36.460 --> 26:39.595
Ah, please don't rain
on my bad news about me

26:39.630 --> 26:41.097
Getting a job
with the good news

26:41.131 --> 26:44.500
About this girl
that I... Barely know.

26:44.534 --> 26:47.303
That's, uh, that's impressive.

26:47.337 --> 26:49.705
It's like listening
to myself on tape.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.741
Well, you didn't say anything.
You know

26:51.775 --> 26:54.744
There's a limit to what you
can do for this girl, right?

26:54.778 --> 26:56.545
And I'm worried
that you're gonna be

26:56.580 --> 26:58.481
Bumping up against her
really soon.

26:58.515 --> 27:00.349
You know, she's
getting healthier, joe.

27:00.384 --> 27:01.751
She is changing.

27:01.785 --> 27:03.352
I can see it.

27:03.387 --> 27:06.155
Well, you've had her
for a few days,

27:06.189 --> 27:08.824
And the world's had
her for 18 years.

27:08.859 --> 27:11.961
Problems like hers don't
just go away overnight.

27:11.995 --> 27:17.199
And at the end of the day,
it's not your job to fix them.

27:20.671 --> 27:24.407
Woman
Paging dr. Bender.
Paging dr. Bender, please.

27:24.441 --> 27:26.842
Man
You're rushing.
Don't rush.

27:26.877 --> 27:30.179
I'm rushing
'cause my shift is
over, mr. Thigpen.

27:30.213 --> 27:31.580
Your shift is over, too.

27:31.615 --> 27:33.549
You're the only
man I know

27:33.583 --> 27:35.985
<i>Spends all day
taking people's blood,</i>

27:36.019 --> 27:39.188
Soon as you're off work,
anytime you're able,

27:39.222 --> 27:40.956
Can't wait to give it.

27:40.991 --> 27:44.527
I'd think you'd get
enough of this 9:00
to 5:00 every day.

27:44.561 --> 27:47.463
That's the difference
between you and I.

27:47.497 --> 27:49.365
I love blood.

27:49.399 --> 27:52.168
Oh, it's just
so remarkable.

27:52.202 --> 27:53.669
Things it can do.

27:53.704 --> 27:55.571
Think about it.

27:55.605 --> 27:57.807
You put that
needle in my arm

27:57.841 --> 28:00.843
And that little bag down
there fills up with my blood,

28:00.877 --> 28:02.745
With a part of me,

28:02.779 --> 28:05.448
Who knows where
it's gonna go.

28:05.482 --> 28:07.049
Could be anywhere.

28:07.084 --> 28:09.452
<i>I could be anywhere.</i>

28:34.943 --> 28:36.977
<i>Extraordinary, really,</i>

28:37.012 --> 28:40.080
<i>All the times I've donated.</i>

28:40.115 --> 28:42.816
<i>You know, there are dozens
of people out there</i>

28:42.851 --> 28:44.451
<i>Walking around with my blood,</i>

28:44.486 --> 28:48.255
<i>With the essence
of me inside them?</i>

28:48.289 --> 28:51.492
<i>And I have records
on all of them.</i>

28:51.526 --> 28:53.427
<i>They know nothing about me.</i>

28:53.461 --> 28:55.129
<i>But I make it my business</i>

28:55.163 --> 28:57.865
<i>To know everything
I can about them.</i>

28:57.899 --> 28:59.733
<i>Where they're living.</i>

28:59.768 --> 29:01.101
<i>How the life...</i>

29:01.136 --> 29:05.305
<i>I've made it possible for them
to continue is going.</i>

29:05.340 --> 29:10.310
<i>For them, it's a completely
anonymous transaction.</i>

29:10.345 --> 29:12.913
<i>But for me...</i>

29:12.947 --> 29:15.949
<i>It's so intimate.</i>

29:15.984 --> 29:20.754
<i>I wonder if they ever think
about where it came from.</i>

29:26.528 --> 29:27.961
No!

29:27.996 --> 29:29.863
Hey, hey,
you all right?

29:29.898 --> 29:32.800
I've been waiting
for you to wake up.

29:32.834 --> 29:36.603
Hey, listen, listen,
I think I figured it out.

29:36.638 --> 29:41.208
I think I know why you
dream the way that you do.

29:43.878 --> 29:47.347
Jennifer?

29:47.382 --> 29:51.318
I had a dream, too.

29:51.352 --> 29:53.220
He did it.

29:53.254 --> 29:55.489
Allison, he killed
that family,

29:55.523 --> 29:58.659
The one that I saw
in the park.

29:58.693 --> 30:01.495
They're all dead.

30:01.529 --> 30:03.530
Okay. Okay.

30:03.565 --> 30:04.998
It's okay, it's okay.

30:05.033 --> 30:06.633
It's all gonna
be over soon.

30:06.668 --> 30:09.236
No, it's not!

30:09.270 --> 30:11.605
He's never gonna stop
what he's doing!

30:11.639 --> 30:12.940
He is.

30:12.974 --> 30:15.876
I know his name.

30:15.910 --> 30:19.446
I think I know how he
became a part of you.

30:19.481 --> 30:21.482
And after tonight,
I don't think

30:21.516 --> 30:24.852
You're ever gonna be dreaming
through his eyes again.

30:30.024 --> 30:33.126
Okay. It's okay,
it's okay.

30:42.890 --> 30:44.591
I was right?

30:44.625 --> 30:46.593
They're dead, aren't they?

30:52.433 --> 30:55.569
The police just got there.

30:55.603 --> 30:58.471
He killed them last night.

30:58.506 --> 31:01.775
Posed them in their backyard.

31:03.578 --> 31:05.946
It's all almost over, Jennifer.

31:05.980 --> 31:08.381
We got his name,
we've got his face--

31:08.416 --> 31:10.317
We're gonna catch him.

31:10.351 --> 31:13.620
It's just a matter of time
at this point.

31:16.857 --> 31:19.092
Jennifer?

31:19.126 --> 31:22.295
Do you think I could
get it taken out?

31:22.330 --> 31:24.364
I'm sorry, what-what's that?

31:24.398 --> 31:26.266
The blood?

31:26.300 --> 31:28.768
Maybe they could
take it out.

31:28.803 --> 31:31.271
Have you ever heard
of anything like that,

31:31.305 --> 31:34.507
An operation or something?

31:34.542 --> 31:36.242
Allison.

31:36.277 --> 31:37.844
Take a look at this.

31:43.416 --> 31:45.818
This guy look familiar?

31:48.188 --> 31:51.023
that's him.

31:51.057 --> 31:53.158
Name's Jonathan Thigpen,
he's had a couple

31:53.193 --> 31:55.294
Of different addresses
registered with the dmv.

31:55.328 --> 31:58.297
Most recent one's
in an apartment in glendale.

31:58.331 --> 32:02.001
I'm gonna head over,
and I'll call you, okay?

32:09.809 --> 32:12.677
You never accepted
my apology.

32:12.711 --> 32:15.280
That's all right;
I don't blame you.

32:15.314 --> 32:17.182
What do you want, keith?

32:17.216 --> 32:19.384
<i>That girl from
the twilight movies.</i>

32:19.418 --> 32:22.320
But that's not gonna happen.

32:22.354 --> 32:25.290
I think I need to be
my own boss.

32:25.324 --> 32:27.192
I think I need to
live in a world--

32:27.226 --> 32:29.360
Professionally,
I'm talking about--

32:29.395 --> 32:33.598
Where I have more control
over the pressure.

32:33.632 --> 32:35.633
I resigned this morning.

32:35.668 --> 32:36.935
What?!

32:36.969 --> 32:39.471
I resigned. Yeah.

32:39.505 --> 32:42.707
I went and talked to dan,
shared my thinking.

32:42.741 --> 32:44.476
He gets it.

32:44.510 --> 32:47.278
I have to agree to some
non-compete language,

32:47.313 --> 32:50.081
But, uh, he's gonna spring me.

32:53.052 --> 32:54.986
I'm sorry.

32:55.020 --> 32:57.655
I mean, I'm happy for you
if that's what you want.

32:57.690 --> 33:02.961
I told him to make you me.

33:02.995 --> 33:05.797
Minus the medication,
obviously.

33:05.831 --> 33:09.467
I think you'd do a good
job at running this place.

33:09.502 --> 33:10.735
Are you sure?

33:10.769 --> 33:12.704
I'm not edison
or curie or jobs.

33:12.738 --> 33:15.039
I mentioned that to him.

33:15.074 --> 33:16.975
He seemed to understand.

33:42.367 --> 33:43.734
Hi, lee.

33:43.768 --> 33:46.470
No, she's right here.

33:46.504 --> 33:49.106
I brought her home so she
could try to get some rest.

33:50.742 --> 33:52.142
He's gone?

33:56.448 --> 33:58.782
Well, it's just
a matter of time.

33:58.817 --> 34:00.551
Let's talk later.

34:08.493 --> 34:10.728
He's gone, isn't he?
He got away.

34:10.762 --> 34:11.795
For now.

34:11.830 --> 34:13.264
The police are
going to get him.

34:13.297 --> 34:15.299
Maybe.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.434
But I've been
thinking about it.

34:17.469 --> 34:19.637
Even if he does go
to jail forever,

34:19.670 --> 34:22.306
I still have his blood
inside me.

34:22.340 --> 34:23.806
What happens when
I fall asleep?

34:23.842 --> 34:26.610
Do I get to dream about the
walls of his prison cell

34:26.645 --> 34:28.012
For the next 50 years?

34:35.587 --> 34:38.489
I don't know.

34:38.523 --> 34:40.891
I mean, whenever I dream
about something like this,

34:40.925 --> 34:43.159
After they catch the person,

34:43.194 --> 34:46.597
After the person is no longer
a danger to anyone else,

34:46.630 --> 34:48.931
The dreams stop.

34:48.967 --> 34:51.534
That is what I'm hoping
happens for you.

34:51.569 --> 34:54.471
But I'm not really like you,
remember?

34:54.505 --> 34:56.040
I wasn't born with this.

34:56.074 --> 34:58.042
I see these things

34:58.076 --> 35:03.747
Because I'm carrying a little
piece of this killer inside me.

35:03.782 --> 35:09.720
And that's not going to change
when they arrest him.

35:09.754 --> 35:11.689
And an hour later,
they bring down a key.

35:11.723 --> 35:13.090
Keith's office is my office.

35:13.124 --> 35:14.325
Oh, honey!

35:14.359 --> 35:15.592
I know, it's nice.

35:15.627 --> 35:17.361
It's got windows
and a couch.

35:17.395 --> 35:19.596
They've already set up
an appointment for me

35:19.631 --> 35:22.666
To go back and pitch to
the department of defense.

35:22.701 --> 35:25.536
I got to tell you, I worry about
keith out there all by himself.

35:25.570 --> 35:28.138
I don't think he quite
realizes what he's in for.

35:29.273 --> 35:32.408
Mom! Dad!

35:33.877 --> 35:35.545
I had $40 of babysitting
money in there,

35:35.579 --> 35:37.346
And then I got out of the shower
and it's not there.

35:37.381 --> 35:39.482
Are you sure you didn't
put it somewhere else?

35:39.516 --> 35:41.350
Positive.
And why are you doing this?

35:41.385 --> 35:43.853
Why are you protecting her?
We all know who took it.

35:43.887 --> 35:45.688
Hey, hey, hey, ariel,
come on.

35:45.722 --> 35:47.457
We don't know
anything yet.

35:47.491 --> 35:48.624
Okay, fine.

35:48.659 --> 35:50.526
I'll talk to jennifer
about it.

35:51.829 --> 35:54.597
Ariel.

35:56.633 --> 35:59.101
Wow, I didn't realize it was
going to be this easy.

35:59.135 --> 36:01.570
She's gone.

36:01.604 --> 36:02.904
Nice, huh?

36:02.939 --> 36:06.108
Well, the cash we keep in
here for emergencies is gone.

36:06.142 --> 36:07.843
You better check
your purse.

36:07.877 --> 36:10.112
This doesn't
make any sense.

36:10.146 --> 36:11.780
It makes all the sense
in the world.

36:11.814 --> 36:13.615
You invited a thief
into our house.

36:13.650 --> 36:14.983
She stole from us.

36:15.018 --> 36:16.518
That's what thieves do.

36:27.597 --> 36:29.564
Everybody all right?

36:29.599 --> 36:31.133
Quite a ride, huh?

36:31.167 --> 36:34.102
Hope you didn't
get jostled too much.

36:37.807 --> 36:39.975
Policeman
Sir, you want to turn
around slowly

36:40.009 --> 36:42.110
And show yourself, please?

36:45.348 --> 36:47.049
Sorry to startle you, sir,

36:47.083 --> 36:48.784
But you're going to need
to move your vehicle.

36:48.818 --> 36:50.452
This road is private property.

36:50.486 --> 36:51.653
The owner called it in.

36:51.688 --> 36:52.954
Oh, my goodness.
I'm sorry.

36:52.989 --> 36:54.256
I had no idea.

36:54.290 --> 36:55.691
Hey, no harm, no foul.

36:58.861 --> 37:01.095
We're a little out of the way
for someone like you.

37:01.130 --> 37:02.864
You, uh, you got anything
good in there?

37:02.898 --> 37:05.433
I'm sure there's something
there you're gonna want.

37:05.467 --> 37:07.235
Why don't you
take a look?

37:13.575 --> 37:15.176
Ooh, what the...

37:26.322 --> 37:28.923
Oh, my...

37:32.528 --> 37:34.629
No more.

37:34.663 --> 37:36.864
No more.

37:36.899 --> 37:38.967
No more.

37:57.801 --> 37:59.335
Hi.

37:59.369 --> 38:01.937
Hey, what are
you doing here?

38:01.972 --> 38:04.240
I didn't think you were
going to be here till tonight.

38:04.274 --> 38:06.042
Well, you've been here for,
like, 13 hours,

38:06.076 --> 38:08.044
So I thought maybe
you could use a break.

38:08.078 --> 38:09.178
Any news?

38:09.212 --> 38:11.714
She's been like this all d.

38:11.748 --> 38:13.316
She hasn't moved. She hasn't

38:13.350 --> 38:15.017
Opened her eyes.

38:19.423 --> 38:21.324
That hers?

38:21.358 --> 38:22.725
Yeah, it's her journal.

38:22.759 --> 38:24.794
I've been reading it
to see if maybe, uh,

38:24.828 --> 38:27.163
She wrote about somebody
who was in her life

38:27.197 --> 38:28.531
Before the accident.

38:28.565 --> 38:31.167
Somebody I should call.
Somebody who should be here.

38:31.201 --> 38:33.302
And?

38:34.705 --> 38:36.405
Mm. Okay.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.207
You, go on.

38:38.241 --> 38:39.642
Go home. Up, up.

38:40.877 --> 38:43.112
Get some food.
Get a little rest.

38:43.146 --> 38:44.947
Clean up.

38:44.981 --> 38:47.249
I'm going to be here till
you're ready to come back.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.385
Okay?

38:53.824 --> 38:55.558
I don't understand--

38:55.592 --> 38:57.760
A truck like that
with a refrigeration unit?

38:57.794 --> 38:59.729
I mean, how many
of those are there?

38:59.763 --> 39:01.664
How hard can that be
to track down?

39:01.698 --> 39:03.599
Scanlon
Yeah, well, according
to the dmv,

39:03.633 --> 39:05.434
Jonathan thigpen isn't
the registered owner

39:05.469 --> 39:07.670
Of any vehicle,
let alone a truck.

39:07.704 --> 39:10.239
Whatever vehicle you
and jennifer saw him in,

39:10.273 --> 39:13.442
We have to assume it was either
stolen or purchased illegally.

39:13.477 --> 39:15.077
What about that policeman?

39:15.112 --> 39:16.912
There must have been
tire tracks nearby.

39:16.947 --> 39:18.981
There were, but that still
doesn't tell us

39:19.015 --> 39:21.217
What the truck
actually looks like.

39:21.251 --> 39:23.052
You see the problem here,
don't you?

39:26.556 --> 39:28.190
Great, it's starting to rain.

39:28.225 --> 39:31.727
Really? Not a cloud
in the sky here.

39:38.135 --> 39:39.402
Hey, you still there?

39:39.436 --> 39:41.237
I'm going to have
to call you back.

39:41.271 --> 39:43.072
You know where to find me.

40:29.686 --> 40:31.420
Scanlon
Hey, long time, no speak.

40:31.455 --> 40:32.788
It still raining where you are?

40:32.823 --> 40:34.990
No, it's suddenly very clear.

40:36.026 --> 40:38.060
And not just the weather.

40:45.334 --> 40:46.868
Go! Go! Go!

40:49.472 --> 40:50.905
Go!
Go!

40:50.940 --> 40:53.241
go! Go! Go!

40:53.275 --> 40:54.976
Watch it!
Hold the line!

41:06.557 --> 41:08.891
Hey.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.928
Welcome back.

41:13.263 --> 41:15.898
You've been unconscious
for a couple days.

41:15.933 --> 41:19.068
Oh, it's so nice
to see your eyes open.

41:20.604 --> 41:24.474
That man, the... The one
that we've been looking for?

41:25.542 --> 41:26.743
I think he's dead.

41:26.777 --> 41:28.778
I-I think that
he shot himself.

41:28.812 --> 41:31.347
Yeah, day before yesterday.

41:31.382 --> 41:34.283
Looks like you're going
to be fine, by the way.

41:34.318 --> 41:38.588
I think this means that
all of those bad dreams
you've been having--

41:38.622 --> 41:42.058
The ones that you've been
seeing through his eyes--

41:42.092 --> 41:44.227
They're over.

41:45.429 --> 41:47.730
So any bad dreams you
have from here on out,

41:47.765 --> 41:49.332
They're your doing.

41:52.770 --> 41:55.405
I stole from you.

41:55.439 --> 41:57.106
You and your kids.

41:58.642 --> 42:00.176
I know.

42:00.210 --> 42:02.845
As soon as I get out
of here, I...

42:02.880 --> 42:06.282
I'll figure out a way
to pay it all back.

42:08.619 --> 42:10.853
I know that, too.

42:12.322 --> 42:14.057
Hey, you know what?

42:14.091 --> 42:15.558
First, we've got
to get you better.

42:15.592 --> 42:17.660
Then, we've got to get you
in touch with some people

42:17.694 --> 42:21.097
Who know how to help you
put your life back together.

42:21.131 --> 42:23.900
Get your education going
again, help you get a job,

42:23.934 --> 42:26.035
So you're not
living on the street.

42:26.070 --> 42:28.471
Sorry.

42:28.505 --> 42:31.541
I don't know who
those people are.

42:31.575 --> 42:34.710
I don't know how
to do any of that.

42:34.745 --> 42:37.847
Hey, I don't either.

42:38.849 --> 42:42.185
But I have it
from an unimpeachable source

42:42.219 --> 42:44.854
That it is going to happen.

42:44.888 --> 42:47.423
It's all going to work out.

42:47.458 --> 42:49.592
You're going to be just fine.

42:49.626 --> 42:54.063
What "unimpeachable source"?

42:55.966 --> 42:57.767
Your mom.

43:00.104 --> 43:02.238
She told me
so many things.

43:03.607 --> 43:06.175
But the most
important was...

43:07.544 --> 43:11.714
...She wanted you to know
how sorry she was

43:11.748 --> 43:14.050
<i>To leave you all alone.</i>

43:18.021 --> 43:22.024
<i>Sorry that you suddenly
had to fend for yourself.</i>

43:25.562 --> 43:29.799
But more important,

43:29.833 --> 43:33.269
She wanted you to know
that in the moment

43:33.303 --> 43:35.638
Right before she died,

43:35.672 --> 43:38.841
<i>She saw you pass over her.</i>

43:40.711 --> 43:43.813
<i>And she has been
watching you ever since.</i>

43:51.755 --> 43:54.223
She will always
be with you.

43:57.394 --> 44:01.797
So live your life
like it matters.
