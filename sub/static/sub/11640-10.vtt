Otherwise,
if we reach hollows trench,

16:55.448 --> 16:57.048
We'll be sitting ducks
out there.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.616
Hollows trench...

16:58.618 --> 16:59.684
Do you think it's deep enough
to drown that giant thing?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.819
One way to find out.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.955
Full steamer ahead.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.394
[ all screaming ]

17:14.599 --> 17:15.800
Oh, no!

17:19.104 --> 17:22.040
[ laughs ]

17:25.611 --> 17:29.113
I did it!
I finally got rid of you!

17:30.949 --> 17:35.520
[ all screaming ]

17:37.890 --> 17:40.458
<i>Wu: Until you embrace</i>
<i>what holds you back,</i>

17:40.460 --> 17:43.227
<i>You'll never discover</i>
<i>your true potential.</i>

17:46.465 --> 17:48.099
[ wails ]

17:48.101 --> 17:52.737
<i>Your weakness</i>
<i>is you give up too easily.</i>

17:52.739 --> 17:55.740
<i>You only like</i>
<i>what comes easy.</i>

18:05.217 --> 18:07.618
<i>Don't be afraid to fail, nya.</i>

18:13.192 --> 18:15.660
[ all screaming ]

18:23.068 --> 18:27.438
What?
Nya!

18:37.282 --> 18:40.551
She's unlocked
her true potential.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.801
No!

19:25.130 --> 19:28.633
[ cheering ]

19:49.855 --> 19:52.156
[ screams ]

19:59.031 --> 20:01.165
Take my hand!

20:01.167 --> 20:03.868
Why? So you can take
the realm crystal,

20:03.870 --> 20:06.637
And use it to find your own
prized pupil?

20:06.639 --> 20:09.006
You're all
my prized pupils.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.542
But none of us
can do this alone.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.244
You're strong, morro,

20:13.246 --> 20:16.614
But it takes others to make us
stronger -- even me.

20:16.616 --> 20:22.386
Take my hand, so we can be
stronger together.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.588
Please, morro.

20:27.259 --> 20:31.963
[ grunting ]

20:31.965 --> 20:36.801
You can only save those
who want to be saved.

20:36.803 --> 20:40.304
Goodbye, sensei.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.806
Ah!

20:46.712 --> 20:48.579
Morro!

20:57.122 --> 20:59.991
[ seagulls crying ]

21:15.040 --> 21:16.540
All right!

21:16.542 --> 21:18.976
Lloyd, you made it.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.411
And so did you!

21:20.413 --> 21:22.313
Good to have you back.
You just missed --

21:22.315 --> 21:24.115
Oh, I know what I missed.

21:24.117 --> 21:27.118
I got a glimpse of
what would happen next

21:27.120 --> 21:29.787
And knew morro
had to return alone.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.555
Just 'cause I'm a green ninja

21:31.557 --> 21:34.058
Doesn't mean I have to
save the day,

21:34.060 --> 21:36.794
Especially when I have
friends to rely on.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.064
And that's why
destiny chose you.

21:40.066 --> 21:43.401
It appears your father's robe
has imparted wisdom,

21:43.403 --> 21:47.305
But you still have a lot to
master to earn the sensei title.

21:47.307 --> 21:51.275
If that's the path I'm on,
I'll take it one step at a time.

21:51.277 --> 21:54.478
The cursed realm is gone,

21:54.480 --> 21:57.315
And so is my father.

21:57.317 --> 22:01.552
But I know we're all in
a better place.

22:01.554 --> 22:04.055
Some of us may look
a little different,

22:04.057 --> 22:06.824
But like our team,
some things never change.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.394
And if they do, that's okay.

22:10.396 --> 22:13.030
Sometimes we just need to
go with the flow.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.466
'cause even if the path
isn't always straight,

22:15.468 --> 22:16.967
We go forward with confidence,

22:16.969 --> 22:19.036
Because we trust where
we're headed.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.472
Yeah, and speaking of
where we're headed,

22:21.474 --> 22:22.907
I've been dying to know,

22:22.909 --> 22:24.575
What are the other realms like,
lloyd?

22:24.577 --> 22:25.976
Come on, spill it.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.145
We have to know what we're
saving, right?

22:28.147 --> 22:29.980
Lloyd: Let's just say,

22:29.982 --> 22:34.452
The future looks bright,
for us and for ninjago.
