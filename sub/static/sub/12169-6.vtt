01:08.367 --> 01:09.561
Hello ?

01:23.127 --> 01:25.038
Good morning, Dr. Weir.

01:25.207 --> 01:28.199
- l’m Dr. Adam Fletcher.
- Where am l ?

01:28.407 --> 01:31.126
You’re in the Acute Care Unit
of Willoughby State Hospital.

01:35.047 --> 01:37.686
Willoughby.
That’s-- That’s a psychiatric hospital.

01:38.207 --> 01:39.925
Outside D.C., yes.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.882
l’m on Earth ?

01:42.727 --> 01:43.876
Yes.

01:45.167 --> 01:46.839
When did l get back ?

01:47.007 --> 01:49.123
You mean, back to Earth ?

01:50.247 --> 01:52.397
Dr. Weir, you never left.

02:55.367 --> 02:57.676
You had just begun mediating
a treaty for the U.N...

02:59.007 --> 03:00.725
... when you collapsed mid-speech.

03:04.247 --> 03:07.364
You’ve been under
a tremendous amount of stress recently.

03:07.527 --> 03:09.563
The treaty negotiation
was the final straw...

03:09.727 --> 03:13.276
... that triggered what is known as
a brief reactive psychosis.

03:14.767 --> 03:16.803
l know you’re confused.

03:17.007 --> 03:18.520
This disorder can be frightening.

03:18.727 --> 03:21.400
The good news is your condition
is most likely transitory.

03:21.607 --> 03:25.282
These episodes usually pass
within a number of days.

03:25.767 --> 03:29.157
l’m sorry, but how did l get here ?

03:29.767 --> 03:32.486
You were transported by ambulance
to a hospital in D.C. --

03:32.647 --> 03:34.126
No, l mean, from Atlantis.

03:36.767 --> 03:39.156
l don’t remember coming back.

03:40.047 --> 03:41.196
Atlantis ?

03:42.727 --> 03:44.763
What’s your security clearance ?

03:45.687 --> 03:47.996
Did you wanna talk to someone
regarding the treaty ?

03:49.487 --> 03:50.806
The U.N. accord.

03:51.447 --> 03:54.007
Non-nuclear proliferation
in North Africa.

03:54.207 --> 03:56.482
That’s what you were mediating
when you collapsed.

03:57.967 --> 04:01.880
l negotiated that treaty
well over two years ago.

04:02.087 --> 04:03.076
No.

04:03.687 --> 04:05.200
Three days ago.

04:06.607 --> 04:08.040
Since then, you’ve been here...

04:08.207 --> 04:11.040
... in a severely depressed
and near-catatonic state.

04:11.927 --> 04:12.916
No.

04:14.247 --> 04:16.807
No, l was in my office...

04:16.966 --> 04:20.357
... and l was reading over
a mission report and--

04:23.247 --> 04:24.885
This-- This can’t be real.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.958
Dr. Weir, l assure you...

04:27.687 --> 04:29.439
... it is real.

04:29.607 --> 04:33.122
Okay. Okay, then, yes.

04:33.287 --> 04:37.678
There is somebody l need to speak with
regarding the treaty...

04:37.847 --> 04:38.996
... right away.

04:47.127 --> 04:49.038
Oh, thank God.

04:49.207 --> 04:51.243
General O’Neill.

04:51.767 --> 04:53.086
Dr. Weir.

04:53.247 --> 04:54.885
Thank you so much for coming.

04:55.047 --> 04:58.039
Hopefully you’Il be able
to help sort out this entire mess.

04:58.247 --> 04:59.965
Anything l can do to help.

05:03.167 --> 05:06.204
- Would you like me to-- ?
- Oh, please.

05:06.367 --> 05:07.846
- -sit ?

05:09.727 --> 05:12.605
It is a relief just seeing a friendly face.

05:12.767 --> 05:15.042
Yeah, l was going for friendly.

05:17.447 --> 05:20.519
This is all very confusing for me.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.917
The last thing l remember...

05:23.087 --> 05:25.647
... l was in Atlantis
and everything was fine.

05:25.807 --> 05:28.037
And next thing l know,
l wake up here.

05:28.887 --> 05:32.357
Everything was fine...

05:32.887 --> 05:34.320
... in Atlantis ?

05:34.487 --> 05:38.799
The problem is my memory.
l have no memory of coming back.

05:38.967 --> 05:41.037
l don’t know
if l came through the stargate...

05:41.207 --> 05:43.721
<i>... or aboard the Daedalus, or--</i>

05:44.407 --> 05:45.396
What ?

05:47.207 --> 05:52.600
Dr. Weir, l’m not quite sure l’m qualified
to be in this conversation.

05:52.767 --> 05:53.836
Oh, please.

05:54.007 --> 05:55.440
You ran Stargate Command.

05:55.607 --> 05:58.565
You are probably
the most qualified person on this planet.

05:58.727 --> 06:00.046
Yeah, okay.

06:01.967 --> 06:03.923
- Why are you doing this ?
- What ?

06:04.087 --> 06:05.839
l’m not trying to do anything.

06:06.847 --> 06:08.963
If you don’t know
what l’m talking about...

06:09.127 --> 06:11.118
... then you’re not really Jack O’Neill.

06:11.287 --> 06:12.959
Oh, l’m Jack O’Neill, all right.

06:13.127 --> 06:16.164
That’s the one thing
in this conversation l am sure about.

06:16.967 --> 06:18.605
l met you a few months ago...

06:18.767 --> 06:23.045
... when we first approached you to help
broker this nonproliferation treaty.

06:23.207 --> 06:26.199
l don’t know anything
about » Atlantis »...

06:26.407 --> 06:29.683
... except that it was a fairly mediocre
Donovan song.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.485
Not one of my favorites.

06:33.127 --> 06:36.324
Now, this Stargate program
l’m supposed to have run--

06:36.487 --> 06:38.682
A facility inside Cheyenne Mountain,
Colorado.

06:38.847 --> 06:42.442
- That would be NORAD.
- Underneath NORAD, yes.

06:42.607 --> 06:44.006
And the stargate ?

06:46.007 --> 06:49.238
It’s a portal that allows
intergalactic travel.

06:49.407 --> 06:51.637
The program’s been in operation
for over 10 years.

06:51.807 --> 06:55.482
You started the whole thing
when you first encountered--

06:59.727 --> 07:01.046
What ?

07:03.127 --> 07:05.436
Look, why don’t l get
Dr. Fletcher in here ?

07:06.007 --> 07:07.918
No, just...

07:08.567 --> 07:09.636
Just leave.

07:10.367 --> 07:12.801
- Please.
- All right.

07:13.327 --> 07:14.646
Listen...

07:14.807 --> 07:17.480
... for what it’s worth,
l hope you get better soon.

07:18.167 --> 07:19.759
We need you.

07:48.527 --> 07:51.678
No, let me go ! No, please let me go !

07:51.847 --> 07:53.599
Let me go ! No !

07:56.647 --> 07:58.319
Let me go !

07:59.847 --> 08:01.599
No, no !

08:02.487 --> 08:03.078
No !

08:21.047 --> 08:24.164
l’ve spoken with several people
at the Pentagon.

08:25.327 --> 08:26.840
They assure me...

08:27.007 --> 08:30.124
... there is no such thing
as the Stargate program.

08:32.366 --> 08:35.563
No Atlantis base in another galaxy.

08:36.246 --> 08:38.715
And no Department
of Homeworld Security.

08:39.527 --> 08:41.198
l’m sorry.

08:41.407 --> 08:46.720
So you are telling me that l dreamt up
the last two years of my life ?

08:47.807 --> 08:51.959
Sometimes when a person experiences
a significant emotional trauma...

08:52.127 --> 08:56.245
... their mind just decides to shut down
to escape the pain.

08:56.607 --> 09:00.122
l have brokered dozens of treaties.

09:00.487 --> 09:03.604
Many of them very stressful, yes...

09:04.047 --> 09:06.607
... but none of them bad enough...

09:07.247 --> 09:09.841
... to cause significant
emotional trauma.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.282
The treaty negotiation
was just the trigger point.

09:13.167 --> 09:16.762
We believe the actual trauma
you suffered occurred three weeks ago.

09:19.887 --> 09:23.721
You were riding in a car
with a man named Simon Wallis.

09:27.007 --> 09:30.317
- You remember Simon ?
- Yes, of course l do.

09:30.647 --> 09:34.799
- We’re no longer in a relationship, but--
- You were coming home from dinner.

09:35.407 --> 09:40.083
A car ran a red light and broadsided you,
impacting the driver’s side door.

09:42.047 --> 09:44.436
Simon was killed instantly.

09:48.407 --> 09:51.285
You suffered only minor injuries
in the crash...

09:51.487 --> 09:53.125
... made a quick recovery.

09:53.287 --> 09:55.323
But in the days
following Simon’s funeral...

09:55.487 --> 09:58.524
... several of your colleagues
noticed your behavior changing.

09:58.727 --> 10:00.877
Clear signs of depression.

10:01.087 --> 10:03.203
- Confusion.
- No.

10:03.407 --> 10:06.524
It culminated in your collapse
at the negotiation.

10:06.687 --> 10:09.724
No. l’m sorry, l don’t believe you.

10:09.887 --> 10:12.799
Sometimes the mind’s only way
to cope with tragedy...

10:12.967 --> 10:15.720
... is to completely erase it
from memory.

10:15.887 --> 10:20.085
And on rare occasions, supplant it with
something else. In this case, something--

10:25.647 --> 10:26.636
You all right ?

10:47.327 --> 10:48.680
Hello, sweetheart.

10:49.287 --> 10:50.640
Mom.

10:53.647 --> 10:56.605
l don’t understand
what’s happening to me, Mom.

10:57.207 --> 11:02.918
l feel as if-- As if l’m asleep
or l’m in a dream.

11:04.687 --> 11:06.439
Look at me.

11:07.407 --> 11:08.999
Do l look like a dream ?

11:10.287 --> 11:12.164
My hand.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.356
Does it feel like a dream ?

11:18.087 --> 11:19.076
No.

11:20.927 --> 11:23.646
But neither did the last two years
of my life.

11:24.527 --> 11:28.645
l just-- l can’t believe
it was all a figment of my imagination.

11:30.207 --> 11:31.686
Give it time.

11:31.847 --> 11:34.315
The doctors here
will help you get through this.

11:35.087 --> 11:36.998
The accident...

11:40.647 --> 11:43.207
Getting that phone call
was the worst night of my life.

11:44.607 --> 11:47.644
We all miss Simon terribly...

11:48.247 --> 11:50.920
... but l don’t know what l’d do
if l lost you.

11:56.287 --> 11:58.357
Oh, wait. l have something.

12:01.087 --> 12:02.076
Your father’s watch.

12:04.007 --> 12:05.998
l found it a few months ago.

12:06.167 --> 12:10.399
- He’d always meant to give it to you.
- l know. l mean...

12:11.407 --> 12:13.796
l mean, l took this with me.

12:23.887 --> 12:26.321
It’s all right, sweetheart.

12:26.967 --> 12:28.844
You’re safe now.

12:29.527 --> 12:31.483
You’Il be fine.

12:32.047 --> 12:34.436
l’Il make certain of it.

13:03.327 --> 13:04.396
Hello ?

13:31.927 --> 13:33.599
Someone-- !

13:34.087 --> 13:36.601
What’s wrong, what’s wrong ?
What’s wrong ?

13:43.807 --> 13:47.402
l’m going to prescribe
some additional medications for you.

13:47.567 --> 13:49.683
A mood stabilizer, an antidepressant...

13:50.247 --> 13:54.001
... and also stronger
antipsychotic medications.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.921
These should help reduce
the acute symptoms you’re experiencing.

13:58.127 --> 14:00.960
Wipe out the last two years
of my life.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.239
l talked with your mother.

14:03.447 --> 14:05.836
She told me how, as a child,
you had a brief phase...

14:06.007 --> 14:08.726
... where you dreamed
of being an astronaut.

14:08.927 --> 14:12.203
She and your father even bought you
a telescope for your 12th birthday.

14:12.367 --> 14:13.880
It’s true.

14:14.087 --> 14:17.079
Sometimes childhood fantasies
can offer a peaceful refuge...

14:17.247 --> 14:19.886
... from the harsh realities of adult life.

14:21.687 --> 14:24.406
So you’re saying when Simon died...

14:24.567 --> 14:27.718
... my mind shut down
and went to another galaxy ?

14:28.207 --> 14:30.721
It traveled as far as it could
to escape the pain.

14:30.927 --> 14:33.157
And in the matter of three days...

14:33.327 --> 14:36.364
... l managed to live out
an entire two years of my life ?

14:36.567 --> 14:39.286
Time is relative in a dream state.

14:39.687 --> 14:43.157
People live out entire lifetimes
in the blink of an eye.

14:44.207 --> 14:47.119
Imagine you were in my position,
listening to your story.

14:47.327 --> 14:49.716
Traveling to another galaxy
through a stargate...

14:49.887 --> 14:54.677
... leading an expedition
to the lost city of Atlantis.

14:56.447 --> 14:57.960
Would you believe it ?

15:19.407 --> 15:20.556
Dr. Weir ?

15:24.487 --> 15:25.920
Your medications.

15:29.087 --> 15:30.679
Thanks.

15:46.847 --> 15:48.758
Have you gone
out to the garden today ?

15:48.927 --> 15:52.806
No. l was going to,
but they’re out there...

15:52.967 --> 15:55.959
... so l decided
it would be better to wait.

15:56.127 --> 15:59.915
- The others ?
- Yes. Four of them.

16:00.087 --> 16:04.603
- Did they see you ?
- Of course. They were waiting for me.

16:04.767 --> 16:06.325
- Did you speak to them ?
- Yes.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.481
l told them what you told me to say...

16:09.647 --> 16:13.526
... that my blood
isn’t theirs for the taking.

16:13.727 --> 16:16.446
Good for you, Enid.
That was very brave.

16:16.647 --> 16:17.682
Excuse me ?

16:19.327 --> 16:20.840
What others ?

16:21.447 --> 16:25.235
The invaders, dear,
from one of the moons of Saturn.

16:25.447 --> 16:27.165
They’re cold-blooded, you see.

16:27.367 --> 16:29.881
So they need our warm blood
for theirs.

16:30.087 --> 16:32.555
You have to be very careful.

16:33.407 --> 16:35.921
Dr. Fletcher
doesn’t think they’re real...

16:36.487 --> 16:37.636
... but l know the truth.

16:39.647 --> 16:42.081
Dr. Weir,
would you like to speak next ?

16:42.287 --> 16:45.120
Perhaps you can tell the group
about your experience in Atlantis.

16:46.647 --> 16:47.636
No.

16:48.127 --> 16:50.118
Sometimes, when we share
these experiences--

16:50.287 --> 16:53.165
l said, no.

17:42.407 --> 17:44.079
Go away.

17:58.167 --> 18:00.044
Go away !

18:34.487 --> 18:36.523
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:36.687 --> 18:38.678
Oh, please.

18:45.887 --> 18:48.765
Will l ever remember the accident ?

18:48.927 --> 18:50.121
l don’t know.

18:50.567 --> 18:54.879
Often in cases like this,
the memory of the trauma never returns.

18:55.727 --> 18:58.241
Maybe it’s the mind protecting itself.

18:58.447 --> 19:00.836
l suppose it’s a good thing, really.

19:01.047 --> 19:04.119
l mean, there’s pain enough,
even without remembering it.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.082
What ?

19:10.407 --> 19:12.045
It’s just, you’re doing great.

19:13.487 --> 19:15.523
l’m impressed.

19:16.287 --> 19:17.322
You’re sleeping well ?

19:17.487 --> 19:20.604
Yes. l’m sleeping better
than l can remember.

19:20.767 --> 19:23.645
Good. l think you’re ready.

19:25.127 --> 19:26.526
Ready ?

19:37.327 --> 19:39.363
Well, is it how you remember it ?

19:39.567 --> 19:42.035
It’s exactly how l remember it.

19:46.447 --> 19:50.406
Oh, Sedgewick. Hey, sweetie. Hey.

19:50.607 --> 19:51.756
Hey.

19:51.927 --> 19:53.758
Welcome home, sweetheart.

20:06.727 --> 20:07.921
Hello, hello.

20:09.447 --> 20:11.756
- General.
- Enough with the » general, » okay ?

20:11.927 --> 20:13.076
It’s Jack.

20:13.287 --> 20:15.118
But which Jack is it ?

20:15.807 --> 20:16.796
What ?

20:17.007 --> 20:20.397
l’m sorry. l was just trying
to have some fun at my own expense.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.400
Too soon, maybe.

20:23.567 --> 20:27.196
- So you all settled back in ?
- Getting there.

20:28.007 --> 20:29.963
So l hear you’re going back
to teaching.

20:30.167 --> 20:32.601
Yeah, my poli-sci class
at Georgetown.

20:32.767 --> 20:35.042
They’re holding it open for me
for the fall.

20:36.127 --> 20:39.802
Have you given any thought
to coming back to the negotiating table ?

20:41.087 --> 20:43.442
That nonproliferation treaty...

20:43.607 --> 20:46.963
... you kind of left us hanging
mid-sentence there.

20:47.167 --> 20:50.682
Sure be nice to hear
the punch line someday.

20:53.327 --> 20:55.318
And the U.N. would be okay with that ?

20:55.487 --> 20:59.082
Not just okay, they’re insisting.

20:59.527 --> 21:01.119
Really ?

21:01.287 --> 21:03.039
When you’re the best,
you’re the best.

21:03.207 --> 21:05.641
Even if you’ve had a little...

21:07.127 --> 21:10.005
... setback, so to speak.

21:11.647 --> 21:13.683
He said awkwardly.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.559
It’s only if you feel
you’re ready to go back.

21:21.647 --> 21:25.276
Well, actually, yeah.

21:25.487 --> 21:27.637
l think l am.

21:42.087 --> 21:43.440
Hey.

21:44.167 --> 21:46.237
It’s good to be home.

22:30.287 --> 22:32.198
What do you got, doc ?

22:32.887 --> 22:34.525
It’s getting worse.

22:34.727 --> 22:36.957
It’s not just her brain anymore.

22:37.127 --> 22:39.277
It’s spreading throughout her body.

22:40.407 --> 22:42.318
We’re losing her.

22:47.207 --> 22:48.435
Those are all nanites ?

22:48.607 --> 22:51.246
Aye. They’ve spread
throughout her entire body.

22:51.407 --> 22:52.806
How did they get inside her ?

22:52.967 --> 22:56.323
Niam. He attacked her
in the Puddle Jumper.

22:57.767 --> 23:00.520
In that one moment,
he managed to infect her with nanites...

23:00.687 --> 23:02.439
... that began replicating immediately.

23:02.767 --> 23:05.600
Now they’re multiplying exponentially,
consuming her.

23:05.767 --> 23:09.362
- How much time does she have ?
- l don’t think their intention’s to kill her.

23:09.807 --> 23:12.799
If that were the case,
they could have easily done it already.

23:12.967 --> 23:15.561
l don’t think there’s enough
to survive on their own.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.877
They need Élizabeth’s body
as raw material.

23:18.047 --> 23:21.244
They’re attempting to assimilate her,
transform her into one of them ?

23:21.407 --> 23:25.366
Until they reach numbers to form a viable
independent entity, l would say so, yes.

23:25.527 --> 23:27.085
This is how they replicate ?

23:27.247 --> 23:30.683
l doubt it’s the normal way.
It may be a last-ditch attempt to survive.

23:30.847 --> 23:32.917
- How do we stop them ?
- EMP.

23:33.087 --> 23:35.920
Hit them with the electromagnetic pulse
like we did last time.

23:36.087 --> 23:38.806
l’m afraid we’re well beyond
that possibility now, colonel.

23:38.967 --> 23:43.245
Nanites have bonded to neurons and cells
throughout her central nervous system.

23:43.407 --> 23:47.116
If we attempt to disable them, we’Il
likely end up killing her along with them.

23:47.287 --> 23:48.720
Then how do we help her ?

23:48.887 --> 23:52.084
In a petri dish, her white blood cells
attack individual nanites...

23:52.247 --> 23:55.523
... as though they were a bacterium
or a virus, quite successfully.

23:55.727 --> 23:59.163
For some reason, inside the body,
there’s almost no immune response.

23:59.487 --> 24:03.321
It’s as if the nanites themselves convinced
her immune system they pose no threat.

24:03.487 --> 24:05.796
- How do they do that ?
- l have no idea.

24:06.847 --> 24:09.998
l’ve begun administering drugs
to help boost her immunities.

24:10.567 --> 24:12.444
- Doesn’t seem to be working.
- Not yet.

24:12.647 --> 24:14.285
l just increased the dosage.

24:15.047 --> 24:18.437
For the moment,
we’re losing this battle.

24:28.687 --> 24:32.043
Hey. Right on time. You all set ?

24:32.207 --> 24:34.482
- l think so.
- Did you get some sleep ?

24:34.647 --> 24:37.957
Yes. But still,
l’ve been really tired lately.

24:38.127 --> 24:40.846
Maybe you’ve gotta work yourself
back into playing shape.

24:41.367 --> 24:45.201
Spend time doing some short shifts
before you jump up to the first line.

24:45.367 --> 24:48.677
l’m sorry. l don’t know
a thing about football.

24:49.567 --> 24:52.127
Nor hockey, apparently.

24:53.447 --> 24:54.800
Thanks.

24:55.007 --> 24:57.237
Strange, Jack, l’m...

24:57.407 --> 24:59.477
l feel kind of numb.

24:59.647 --> 25:02.605
- You know, l feel like that all the time.
- l’m serious.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.519
Did you talk to Dr. Fletcher about it ?

25:04.727 --> 25:06.763
Yes. He says
probably just my medications.

25:06.927 --> 25:10.078
He’s gonna adjust the doses,
dial them back, see if that helps.

25:10.247 --> 25:12.317
Probably just a matter
of balance then, eh ?

25:12.927 --> 25:14.246
All right.

25:14.727 --> 25:17.195
Now, just to be sure
we’re on the same page...

25:17.367 --> 25:20.279
... we’re against the proliferation
of nuclear weapons, right ?

25:20.447 --> 25:21.482
Got it.

25:34.007 --> 25:36.362
Do you think she’s aware we’re here ?

25:36.567 --> 25:39.445
How can she be ? She’s unconscious.

25:41.727 --> 25:43.160
You may be right.

25:43.327 --> 25:46.399
You could try talking to her.
Tell her to keep fighting.

25:46.567 --> 25:48.956
And that will help exactly how ?

25:49.127 --> 25:52.642
In a coma, one’s sense of hearing
is the last to go and the first to return.

25:53.167 --> 25:56.523
There are cases where patients
were able to hear others talking to them.

25:56.687 --> 25:59.485
Were these comas caused
by nanites invading peoples’bodies ?

25:59.647 --> 26:01.797
No, but there are indications
she’s thinking.

26:01.967 --> 26:03.764
- You mean dreaming.
- More than that.

26:04.527 --> 26:07.041
Her mind is extremely active
for someone in a coma.

26:07.207 --> 26:10.358
Her EEG reads almost as if
she were going about her daily life...

26:10.567 --> 26:13.365
... which suggests
she may well be able to hear us.

26:13.567 --> 26:15.717
What the hell are they doing to her ?

26:15.927 --> 26:16.916
l wish l knew.

26:18.447 --> 26:21.245
The immune-boosting drugs
are having no effect.

26:22.687 --> 26:25.076
Aggressive little bastards.

26:27.447 --> 26:29.517
- What ?
- What ?

26:29.687 --> 26:31.803
That’s the same look l get
when l have an idea.

26:31.967 --> 26:35.357
- How would you know how you looked ?
- It’s happened in front of a mirror.

26:35.527 --> 26:36.642
Carson, what is it ?

26:37.287 --> 26:40.757
l don’t know about brilliant,
but it just might...

26:40.927 --> 26:42.918
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing ?

26:44.647 --> 26:46.478
If Carson’s right
and you can hear me...

26:46.647 --> 26:49.923
... l suppose l should say
something profound.

26:53.127 --> 26:56.642
Okay, l’m not so good at profound...

26:56.807 --> 26:58.559
... but you should know...

26:58.727 --> 27:01.366
... we’re doing everything we can
to get you through this.

27:31.407 --> 27:34.205
These nanites, l don’t know
what they’re putting you through.

27:34.367 --> 27:36.198
l don’t know
what they’re doing to you...

27:37.847 --> 27:39.360
... but don’t let them get to you.

27:45.247 --> 27:47.681
We’re doing everything we can
to bring you back...

27:47.847 --> 27:49.838
... but you’ve got to do your part.

27:50.007 --> 27:51.440
You gotta fight this.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.360
l’m sure this is just a result...

28:04.527 --> 28:06.836
... of the adjustment l made
to your medications.

28:07.327 --> 28:10.205
l think l may have
dialed them back too far.

28:10.407 --> 28:13.285
It’s all a question of balance.

28:14.847 --> 28:16.439
That’s what General O’Neill said.

28:18.007 --> 28:19.042
Yes. Well, he’s right.

28:19.887 --> 28:22.879
Don’t worry.
We’Il get you back to normal.

28:26.447 --> 28:28.085
<i>Élizabeth...</i>

28:32.167 --> 28:33.361
What do you want ?

29:09.287 --> 29:12.006
No. Wait. No.

29:12.207 --> 29:15.324
Let go of me ! No !

29:29.927 --> 29:31.246
Hey.

29:33.287 --> 29:35.005
How you feeling ?

29:38.487 --> 29:40.603
Why am l back here ?

29:41.007 --> 29:42.122
They’re worried.

29:42.727 --> 29:45.036
Frankly, so am l.

29:48.087 --> 29:51.921
Look, obviously, l’ve been pushing you
a little hard on this treaty thing.

29:52.087 --> 29:53.520
No.

29:53.687 --> 29:56.360
- l feel fine.
- Well, you’re not.

29:57.967 --> 30:00.401
You’re gonna be here
until you get better.

30:08.407 --> 30:09.396
<i>Okay.</i>

30:09.647 --> 30:11.000
We think we’ve found a way...

30:11.167 --> 30:14.204
... to uncouple the nanite cells
from Élizabeth’s cells.

30:14.367 --> 30:15.595
-« ou » ?We« ou » ??
- How ?

30:15.767 --> 30:18.759
We create a distraction.

30:19.567 --> 30:22.718
It finally occurred to me
why l wasn’t having any success.

30:22.887 --> 30:25.117
What were the nanites originally
designed to do ?

30:25.327 --> 30:28.160
- Fight the Wraith.
- That’s what we’Il get them to do now.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.524
By implanting a small amount
of Wraith tissue into Dr. Weir’s body--

30:31.687 --> 30:33.598
- Just like a tumor.
- A small tumor, yes.

30:33.767 --> 30:35.723
- The nanite cells will--
- Will attack it.

30:35.887 --> 30:37.605
It’s what they’re programmed to do...

30:37.767 --> 30:40.884
... which will draw them away
from Élizabeth’s cells, unbinding them.

30:41.047 --> 30:44.926
It will only last a few seconds before
the nanites attack the Wraith tissue...

30:45.087 --> 30:47.203
- ... and return focus to Dr. Weir.
- All we need.

30:47.367 --> 30:51.246
Distraction to draw them away from her
so we can zap them with the EM pulse.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.156
Okay. Let’s do it.

30:57.327 --> 30:58.680
Rodney, come here a minute.

31:47.287 --> 31:50.677
Wait a minute. Aren’t we supposed
to turn off all Earth-based equipment...

31:50.847 --> 31:52.360
... in the room before we do this ?

31:52.527 --> 31:54.802
The EM pulse will be directed
through the scanner.

31:54.967 --> 31:56.685
The other equipment should be fine.

32:03.567 --> 32:05.478
l keep seeing these symbols.

32:06.487 --> 32:09.047
- Eight of them.
- Do they mean something to you ?

32:09.767 --> 32:12.964
This is the dialing sequence
for the stargate.

32:13.167 --> 32:15.078
From Earth to Atlantis.

32:15.287 --> 32:17.005
« Dialing sequence« ou » ??
Like a phone number ?

32:17.447 --> 32:20.245
Look, l know
you think l’m delusional...

32:20.767 --> 32:22.997
... but l can’t shake
the overpowering feeling...

32:23.167 --> 32:28.799
... that something or someone
is trying to communicate with me.

32:29.167 --> 32:33.080
- And what are they trying to say ?
- That Atlantis is real.

32:33.447 --> 32:35.642
And that l have to get back there.

32:36.167 --> 32:37.156
And...

32:37.727 --> 32:40.241
So we’re the fantasy ?

32:43.127 --> 32:44.799
- Yes.
- You know...

32:45.367 --> 32:48.757
... l don’t mind being fantasized
about occasionally...

32:49.047 --> 32:51.641
... but come on, we’re right here.

32:52.127 --> 32:53.276
How would you get there ?

32:54.127 --> 32:56.322
Go to Stargate Command.

32:57.447 --> 32:59.756
So now you just wanna waltz
into NORAD, is that it ?

32:59.927 --> 33:01.519
l know what you told me.

33:02.087 --> 33:06.239
But l also know what l feel.

33:06.647 --> 33:10.959
Atlantis is real.
And l will get back there.

33:11.207 --> 33:12.322
And it’s working.

33:16.927 --> 33:17.916
They’re moving fast.

33:18.087 --> 33:20.647
- Get ready with the EM pulse.
- l’m ready on your mark.

33:21.247 --> 33:23.363
And now.

33:29.527 --> 33:31.279
l thought you said that--

33:33.327 --> 33:35.682
- It worked.
- Carson, you might be an absolute--

33:35.847 --> 33:39.203
Oh, no. We didn’t get them all.

33:39.407 --> 33:40.760
How is that possible ?

33:40.967 --> 33:43.162
l don’t bloody know.

33:43.327 --> 33:45.716
They’ve been using organic material
to replicate...

33:45.887 --> 33:47.957
... which rendered them immune
to the EM pulse.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.276
So now what ?

33:49.927 --> 33:51.724
They’ve started replicating again.

33:56.807 --> 33:58.718
You spit out your pills again,
didn’t you ?

34:01.007 --> 34:02.884
You disappoint me, Élizabeth.

34:03.087 --> 34:04.759
The pills are not gonna help me.

34:04.967 --> 34:06.878
Not if you won’t let them.

34:07.447 --> 34:10.041
You leave me no other choice.

34:11.806 --> 34:13.525
No !

34:22.806 --> 34:24.001
Don’t do this.

34:26.766 --> 34:27.802
This will hurt.

34:33.567 --> 34:35.523
- What do we do now ?
- Zap her again.

34:35.687 --> 34:37.199
Keep it up till they’re gone.

34:37.367 --> 34:39.927
A number of nanites
have migrated into the arteries...

34:40.087 --> 34:42.521
... that supply blood flow
to functions of her brain.

34:42.687 --> 34:44.405
They’re telling us they can kill her.

34:44.567 --> 34:46.364
Switch her over
to 100 percent oxygen.

34:46.527 --> 34:48.882
Start her on norepinephrine,
five mics per minute.

34:49.047 --> 34:52.755
Reducing blood flow to parts of her brain
will put her into cerebral hypoxia.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.320
What will that do ?

34:54.487 --> 34:57.399
Render her essentially brain-dead,
which makes no sense.

34:57.607 --> 34:59.518
Unless she’s fighting it.

35:02.287 --> 35:04.642
It’s the only thing that makes sense.

35:04.927 --> 35:06.838
The replicators see us
as organic machines.

35:07.007 --> 35:09.601
They’re trying to take control
of the machine they’re in.

35:09.767 --> 35:12.156
You mean,
replace Élizabeth’s consciousness ?

35:12.327 --> 35:14.477
Maybe when we zapped her
with the EMP...

35:14.647 --> 35:16.683
... we killed enough
of them to even the odds.

35:16.847 --> 35:18.883
Gave her a fighting chance
at stopping them.

35:19.087 --> 35:22.796
Reality check. There are
microscopic robots in her brain.

35:22.967 --> 35:24.161
How does she fight that ?

35:24.327 --> 35:27.399
You said her mind was active,
like she was thinking, living life.

35:27.607 --> 35:30.280
What if this was the only way
they could get to her ?

35:30.447 --> 35:34.042
What if they were trying
to force her to give up ?

35:34.207 --> 35:36.801
- A battle of wills ?
- Exactly.

35:37.167 --> 35:40.318
Her neural activity supports
Colonel Sheppard’s hypothesis, Rodney.

35:40.887 --> 35:42.366
So, what, we can’t do anything ?

35:42.527 --> 35:46.884
l can increase the oxygen levels
in her blood, give her a little more time...

35:47.087 --> 35:51.922
- ... but yes, she’s on her own.
- No. She’s not.

35:55.047 --> 35:57.117
You’re not alone.
We’re right here with you.

35:57.287 --> 35:58.481
You have to fight this.

35:58.647 --> 36:00.205
<i>Fight this. Fight this...</i>

36:53.527 --> 36:55.119
Dr. Weir ?

36:56.327 --> 36:57.316
It’s okay.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.404
You’re safe now.

37:00.687 --> 37:01.802
Where am l ?

37:02.767 --> 37:04.166
Stargate Command.

37:05.247 --> 37:06.805
It’s okay.

37:07.007 --> 37:08.520
Follow me.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.046
Élizabeth.

37:12.527 --> 37:14.199
Don’t listen to them.

37:15.167 --> 37:16.156
What’s wrong ?

37:16.367 --> 37:18.005
This way.

37:22.167 --> 37:24.158
l’m not going to hurt you.

37:25.247 --> 37:27.442
The hell you aren’t.

37:39.487 --> 37:42.365
They’ve begun to spread faster.
We’re losing her.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.245
Not yet we’re not.

37:44.447 --> 37:45.596
What are you doing ?

37:46.447 --> 37:48.358
What are you, crazy ?
She could infect you.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.159
Élizabeth.

37:52.047 --> 37:53.560
John.

37:53.767 --> 37:56.201
You’ve been infected by nanites.

37:56.407 --> 37:58.875
They’re trying to take control
of your mind and body.

37:59.967 --> 38:01.161
Don’t let them do it.

38:02.207 --> 38:04.198
You have to fight them.

38:04.407 --> 38:05.556
So fight.

38:05.767 --> 38:07.405
Élizabeth.

38:08.727 --> 38:10.285
You have to come with us.

38:11.967 --> 38:13.286
l’m sorry.

38:13.767 --> 38:16.201
You know which way you have to go.

38:17.167 --> 38:18.646
Run.

38:24.847 --> 38:26.485
Get him out of there.

38:27.167 --> 38:29.442
Put him into isolation
and run a scan immediately.

38:48.127 --> 38:49.446
l can’t let you go.

38:49.647 --> 38:51.399
You’re not General O’Neill.

38:52.327 --> 38:53.840
Élizabeth, listen to me.

38:54.047 --> 38:56.197
You see that ? That’s the stargate.

38:56.367 --> 38:58.722
And yes, leaving
is exactly what l plan to do.

38:58.927 --> 39:00.406
l won’t let you go.

39:00.607 --> 39:02.120
You can’t stop me.

39:02.767 --> 39:05.918
On the contrary. l already have.

39:06.527 --> 39:08.802
l made your friend disappear,
haven’t l ?

39:09.207 --> 39:10.196
That’s right.

39:10.407 --> 39:14.036
He can’t help you now.
And you can’t possibly get past me.

39:14.807 --> 39:16.035
So you see...

39:16.887 --> 39:18.115
... you’ve lost.

39:36.487 --> 39:37.920
Where am l ?

39:38.127 --> 39:41.085
The infirmary. How you feeling ?

39:45.607 --> 39:47.165
l’m back in Atlantis.

39:48.127 --> 39:49.799
You never left.

40:07.367 --> 40:09.039
Still up, huh ?

40:09.247 --> 40:10.726
Oh, hey.

40:11.727 --> 40:14.525
Yeah, l wasn’t all that keen
to go back to sleep just yet.

40:14.727 --> 40:15.876
Understandable.

40:16.087 --> 40:18.203
l’m glad you’ve been released
from quarantine.

40:18.407 --> 40:19.886
Yeah.

40:20.087 --> 40:22.476
Well, l guess the nanites
were too focused on you...

40:22.647 --> 40:23.796
... to spread to me.

40:26.247 --> 40:29.922
l now realize just how insidious
they really are.

40:30.487 --> 40:32.921
If such a small number
of them could do that to me...

40:33.087 --> 40:34.918
Let’s just take it as a win right now.

40:35.087 --> 40:36.759
All right. Still...

40:37.527 --> 40:39.757
... l can’t believe l was only out
for five hours.

40:40.447 --> 40:41.960
Felt longer, huh ?

40:42.167 --> 40:45.284
Yes. A lifetime.

40:46.687 --> 40:49.565
Well, it’s good to have you back
in the real world.

40:51.087 --> 40:52.918
At least l think it’s the real world.

40:53.127 --> 40:55.038
l could be infected now,
which makes me--

40:55.207 --> 40:56.720
John.

40:57.207 --> 40:58.435
Don’t.

40:59.167 --> 41:00.885
Sorry.
