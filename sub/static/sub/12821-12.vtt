00:00.633 --> 00:02.701
<i>Previously on "zero hour"...</i>

00:02.703 --> 00:03.735
What am i looking at?

00:03.738 --> 00:05.270
A blueprint
for the son of god.

00:05.272 --> 00:06.405
They didn't want the cross.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.207
They wanted what was
inside of it.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.308
The blood of christ.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.509
Remember what happens

00:10.511 --> 00:12.077
Right before
the end of the world?

00:12.079 --> 00:14.346
Christ returns to earth.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.548
There is to be
no negotiation,

00:16.550 --> 00:18.617
Just death
and proof of death.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.387
Hank and laila die today.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.055
You'd fight for me?

00:23.057 --> 00:24.757
If anybody came at you,
i'd cut 'em in half.

00:24.759 --> 00:26.492
You do believe in god?

00:26.494 --> 00:30.529
I believe that there are things
beyond our comprehension.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.531
Is one of those things
a higher power?

00:32.533 --> 00:33.699
I don't know.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.235
I draw.
Helps me see things.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.704
Things i don't want
to forget.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.172
You really think
you can fix me?

00:40.174 --> 00:42.241
Your eyes will be sensitive
for a while.

00:42.243 --> 00:45.177
It didn't work.
Vision is a little bit off.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.179
You didn't come here

00:47.181 --> 00:48.514
To save me, did you,
laila?

00:51.218 --> 00:53.052
Beck, they're getting away.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.353
Come here, pretty one.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.555
Don't shoot!
He's got a hostage!

<i>11 is the number of birth,</i>

01:12.740 --> 01:15.808
<i>The fruit of a mother's womb.</i>

01:15.810 --> 01:19.078
<i>But the child
that comes forth</i>

01:19.080 --> 01:21.180
<i>Shall bring impending doom.</i>

03:07.288 --> 03:10.689
I'm looking for n35ag.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.958
Alpha... whatever "g" is.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.794
Hey, will you go get
that printout, please?

03:15.796 --> 03:17.462
Thank you. Hank!

03:17.464 --> 03:19.364
We got nothing.
Wherever they went,

03:19.366 --> 03:20.966
Wherever they took rachel,
they're in the wind now.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.301
Yeah, well, they're
in a helicopter.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.468
They couldn't have
gotten far.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.703
No, they didn't.
That's the point.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.971
We found the copter

03:25.973 --> 03:27.506
Ditched at an airstrip
in maine.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.474
An airstrip,
it turns out,

03:29.476 --> 03:33.312
Where a gulfstream licensed
to the 41 trust was hangared.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.314
A plane like that holds
5,000 miles worth of fuel.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.216
They could be anywhere
by now.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.484
Keep lookin'!

03:40.654 --> 03:41.987
Mickle.

03:41.989 --> 03:42.955
Why'd you let me
go to sleep?

03:42.957 --> 03:44.456
You've been through
a lot.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.625
Sometimes turning the brain
off for 20 minutes

03:46.627 --> 03:48.293
Is the best thing
you can do.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.661
Laila--She's, uh...

03:49.663 --> 03:52.631
They told me.
I'm sorry.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.300
Why does religion
do this to people?

03:55.302 --> 03:59.271
It's not religion, it's man's
faulty interpretation of it.

03:59.273 --> 04:03.475
We somehow think killing
in the name of god

04:03.477 --> 04:05.244
Will give us what we want,

04:05.246 --> 04:09.381
While forgetting
one of the first things he said.

04:09.383 --> 04:12.417
"Thou shalt not kill."

04:18.491 --> 04:19.690
What is this?

04:19.692 --> 04:22.294
Oh, uh...
it's old habit.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.329
Write down my dreams
so i don't forget 'em.

04:24.331 --> 04:25.430
Vespers?

04:25.432 --> 04:27.633
It's a name.
Some sort of explorer.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.269
And... olive trees?

04:30.271 --> 04:31.603
Does it matter?

04:31.605 --> 04:33.338
Indulge me.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.474
They were carrying them
in the snow.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.643
Look, we shouldn't be
talking about this now.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.845
We need to find rachel.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.780
Right.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.449
Arron? What about cell phones?

04:44.451 --> 04:47.286
Vincent's and lynch--
Anything on them?

04:55.362 --> 04:59.031
I've had this blindfold on for
long enough, don't you think?

05:07.774 --> 05:09.308
Where are we?

05:10.576 --> 05:13.679
Welcome to the holiest
of the holies.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.466
Take her to the room
if you could.

05:36.069 --> 05:39.938
Make sure she has a bed
with the others.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.816
Gentlemen,
you are seeing something

05:50.818 --> 05:53.352
Very few eyes ever have--

05:53.354 --> 05:56.588
The monastery of st. John
of patmos,

05:56.590 --> 05:59.491
A place long hidden
from the world.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.959
Excuse me, ms. Lynch.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.995
If i could have a moment?

06:03.997 --> 06:07.866
As far as i know, uh,
i'm not necessary anymore.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.434
I've given you
what you want.

06:10.503 --> 06:13.138
We lost dr. Galliston
yesterday.

06:13.140 --> 06:17.008
The man who was going to
spearhead the cloning work.

06:17.010 --> 06:20.479
The good news is, he provided
a template for us.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.580
For you.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.815
Uh... um...

06:23.817 --> 06:24.983
I'm not, um...

06:24.985 --> 06:28.019
I'm not proficient
in that sort of...

06:28.021 --> 06:31.123
But you do have
the necessary information now.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.791
Step by step.

06:32.793 --> 06:36.995
Have you forgotten
the reason you came on?

06:36.997 --> 06:41.433
Your ambition to sequence
the blood of christ?

06:41.435 --> 06:43.602
My thought was
i could publish--

06:43.604 --> 06:45.570
In the "journal
of science, medicine."

06:45.572 --> 06:47.606
Show the world
what we've done.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.776
Oh, the world will know,
theo.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.745
But first we've got to
finish what we've begun.

07:03.055 --> 07:04.990
What is this?

07:04.992 --> 07:07.592
You're to hand off
your weapons, mr. Vincent.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.994
No, thank you.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.595
This is a house of god.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.064
It's a non-Negotiable point.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.742
The lord said,
"love thy enemy."

07:23.744 --> 07:27.012
He never said to trust him.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.148
Where are you taking me?

07:30.150 --> 07:32.150
Your questions
are annoying me.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.820
Well, at least tell me
what country we're in.

07:55.174 --> 07:57.576
Hey! Foreign number!

07:58.611 --> 08:00.979
Hey, track it!

08:04.117 --> 08:05.917
Hello?

08:05.919 --> 08:07.752
Arron.
Rachel.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.955
Oh, my god, are you--
Where--Where are you?

08:09.957 --> 08:13.091
I don't know. Um,
i'm in some monastery somewhere.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.227
Guys have accents. It sounds
like they're eastern european--

08:15.229 --> 08:16.495
Arron!

08:17.664 --> 08:19.564
Rachel!

08:19.566 --> 08:21.032
Wh--

08:22.569 --> 08:24.636
You get it?
Did you get it?!

08:24.638 --> 08:27.906
Tell me you tracked that.
It looks like it was
a sat phone,

08:27.908 --> 08:29.875
So we should be able
to iso it on gps.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.109
Just...

08:31.111 --> 08:32.177
What?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.745
The location it's showing--

08:33.746 --> 08:35.080
It's not on this earth.

08:38.851 --> 08:44.956
Â™ª

08:52.298 --> 08:53.765
Okay, how about we go over
this one more time?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.901
Now, the signal is telling you
what, exactly?

08:55.903 --> 08:57.969
Your friend's call is not
geo-Locating

08:57.971 --> 08:59.671
On the surface of this world.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.541
Does that not say
"gulf of thailand"?

09:02.543 --> 09:05.110
<i>It says a hundred miles
beneath the gulf of thailand.</i>

09:05.112 --> 09:07.178
Hundred--
That's what i'm trying
to tell you.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.847
I've never gotten a reading
like this before.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.850
They're scrambling it.
So let's unscramble it.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.219
I don't know how the hell
to do it, but i'll try.

09:48.187 --> 09:49.788
Do you speak english?

09:49.790 --> 09:50.989
I do.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.325
Good. Can you
tell me where i am?

09:54.360 --> 09:56.828
A waiting room.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.164
I guess you'd call it
that, right?

09:59.166 --> 10:01.199
A waiting room?

10:01.201 --> 10:03.602
A good sort of waiting room.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.870
A waiting room for what?

10:07.373 --> 10:08.840
For heaven.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.816
Have you seen mickle?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.851
No, but i got something.

10:19.853 --> 10:23.254
Gps uses four satellites
to locate an object, right?
Mm-Hmm.

10:23.256 --> 10:26.358
Rachel's call gave us three
over tajikistan

10:26.360 --> 10:29.728
And a fourth over
perth, australia.
That can't be right,

10:29.730 --> 10:31.329
'Cause they're halfway across
the world from each other.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.732
They must have re-Coded one
to act as a decoy,

10:33.734 --> 10:35.700
Broadcast a false signal from
the other side of the world--

10:35.702 --> 10:37.769
You skew the data.
I built a map

10:37.771 --> 10:41.973
Based on where the three
known satellites overlap,

10:41.975 --> 10:43.875
And the probabilities of
whether they overlap

10:43.877 --> 10:48.179
Now, it's either east or west
of this area in tajikistan.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.652
Oh. I'd say east.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.821
Blacked-Out airspace.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.390
Somebody very powerful

10:58.392 --> 11:01.826
Does not want people
to look there.

11:04.697 --> 11:08.066
It's a great group here.
From all over the world.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.802
Like a noah's ark of girls.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.772
How'd you end up here?

11:13.774 --> 11:17.242
In my village, it hadn't
rained in almost a year.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.444
Many people were dying.

11:19.446 --> 11:23.815
The 41 trust came in--
With food, medicine.

11:23.817 --> 11:27.719
Ms. Lynch was there
the day my mother passed.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.889
She took me in,
brought me here--

11:30.891 --> 11:32.424
Into this family.

11:32.426 --> 11:35.727
She gave us all this
incredible place to live.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.929
Clothing, school.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.998
For orphans like us,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.401
We never would have
had that otherwise.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.769
Orphans.

11:44.771 --> 11:47.272
You, too?

11:47.274 --> 11:48.873
Yeah, but...

11:48.875 --> 11:50.442
But what?

11:52.111 --> 11:54.746
Do you guys always stay
in here?

11:54.748 --> 11:57.782
Mostly, but it's not like
we can't do what we want.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.053
Then why's the door locked
from the outside?

12:06.126 --> 12:08.126
Yamin.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.839
She's the first
to be chosen.

12:22.041 --> 12:24.042
Chosen for what?

12:29.515 --> 12:31.449
Oh. I can't believe it.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.984
This...

12:32.986 --> 12:34.953
Is the blood of christ.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.956
A viable, living strain
of d.N.A.,

12:37.958 --> 12:40.125
After 2,000 years of dormancy.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.860
Resurrection, theo.

12:41.862 --> 12:45.196
Life born from death.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.366
Almost makes you want to be
a believer, doesn't it?

12:48.368 --> 12:52.170
I don't know what to believe
anymore, but this...

12:52.172 --> 12:53.905
This is incredible.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.040
And per the template
dr. Galliston laid out,

12:56.042 --> 12:58.243
It can be propagated?

12:58.245 --> 13:01.012
Theoretically, yes.
Like dolly the sheep,

13:01.014 --> 13:02.280
You'd remove
the genetic information

13:02.282 --> 13:04.215
From an unfertilized egg,

13:04.217 --> 13:07.886
Slide in the new d.N.A.,
put it in vitro...

13:07.888 --> 13:10.121
And let natural birth occur.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.524
Perhaps it's time
to get started.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.420
Oh...

14:03.609 --> 14:06.211
They have done something
to me, haven't they?

14:19.592 --> 14:21.860
That's a lot
of blacked-Out airspace.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.928
It's gotta be at least
200 square miles.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.997
Area 51's only blacked out
for 20.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.366
Impossible.
What is?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.235
So i figured if we can't see
what's there digitally,

14:30.237 --> 14:31.569
We'd go old school.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.072
It's just a bunch
of wilderness.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.640
You're missing something.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.042
The satellite image has
two mountain ranges

14:38.044 --> 14:40.411
On either side
of the blacked-Out space.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.381
And on this map,
there is only one.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.283
Looks like they pinched them
together on the map,

14:45.285 --> 14:46.618
Made one range.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.586
But on the satellite,
there are definitely two,

14:48.588 --> 14:50.154
With a valley in between

14:50.156 --> 14:51.656
Underneath
the blacked-Out space.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.559
What the hell's
going on here?
Maybe the map's wrong.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.128
Well, then this map
would have to be wrong.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.464
And this one, too.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.900
Look at that.
Three different maps.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.035
Three different cartographers
over hundreds of years,

15:04.037 --> 15:06.337
And all of them
omit the valley.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.673
You know what you're
saying, don't you?
Conspiracy.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.275
Big one. Huge.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.076
We're talking about hiding
a chunk of land

15:12.078 --> 15:14.178
The size of rhode island.
It can't be done.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.680
It's already been done.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.416
The question is,
what are they hiding?

15:28.294 --> 15:32.630
Hail mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.933
Blessed art thou
amongst women,

15:34.935 --> 15:38.336
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, jesus.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.548
Fruit of thy womb.

15:53.152 --> 15:55.153
The burmese girl--

15:55.155 --> 15:57.455
There's been
a complication.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.129
What's going on?

16:05.131 --> 16:06.331
I don't know. I...

16:06.333 --> 16:07.598
It was standard in vitro
procedure.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.101
We implanted the egg,
everything was fine,

16:10.103 --> 16:11.569
Then she goes into
cardiac arrest.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.089
We need to hold off until
we know what we're dealing with.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.324
We know what we're
dealing with.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.026
We don't.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.261
We just tried to put
2,000-Year-Old d.N.A.

16:37.263 --> 16:40.198
Into a woman's body, and that
woman's body rejected it.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.667
<i>Or did the d.N.A.
Reject her?</i>

16:42.669 --> 16:46.337
This isn't just some
40-Year-Old soccer mom

16:46.339 --> 16:47.672
Trying to get pregnant.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.074
We're talking about
the son of god.

16:50.076 --> 16:52.243
Why do you think mary
was chosen?

16:52.245 --> 16:54.445
Because she had
the right d.N.A.?

16:54.447 --> 16:58.649
It was because the purity
in her heart was unsurpassed.

16:58.651 --> 17:02.253
That's the type of host
we need to be looking for.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.203
What are you doing?

17:19.204 --> 17:21.172
I'm looking for a way out.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.473
Everyone is homesick
at first...

17:23.476 --> 17:25.042
But you'll learn.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.277
There's nothing
but love here.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.678
Yeah? Is that why they
keep us locked in here,

17:27.680 --> 17:30.048
To keep all the love
from getting out?

17:31.584 --> 17:35.453
They'd like to see you
up in the chapel, alima.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.790
Don't go with him.

17:40.259 --> 17:43.227
You're wrong about
this place, rachel.

17:46.698 --> 17:48.566
It couldn't have been
an oversight, right?

17:48.568 --> 17:51.335
The mapmakers would have to know
that a valley was there.

17:51.337 --> 17:54.305
Maybe not. Little-Known
thing about cartography--

17:54.307 --> 17:56.174
Lots of plagiarism.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.842
Ever hear of "trap streets"?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.811
It's a little trick
where a mapmaker

17:59.813 --> 18:02.346
Would create a street
that doesn't exist, a trap.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.515
And if that street shows up
on a later map,

18:04.517 --> 18:06.217
They know that that map
copied theirs.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.753
So people would just blindly
copy the mapmaker before them?

18:08.755 --> 18:10.588
With whatever new
that's been discovered,

18:10.590 --> 18:13.357
But, yeah, for a long time,
that's exactly how it was.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.193
So if there was a conspiracy
to hide the valley,

18:15.195 --> 18:16.861
I mean,
it couldn't take much.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.362
If the area's remote
enough,

18:18.364 --> 18:20.364
Few people go back
and re-Map it.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.634
That is, until satellites
started doing the work for them.

18:23.636 --> 18:27.138
Technology changes,
and they're still hiding it.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.841
It's positively thrilling,
hank.

18:29.843 --> 18:32.110
And frightening.
Mm.

18:32.112 --> 18:35.213
I've got a couple of other maps
i want to run against this.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.747
Be back in a minute.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.186
Get that look off
your face, okay?

18:42.188 --> 18:43.521
We're gonna go there

18:43.523 --> 18:45.356
And we're gonna bring
rachel home.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.826
We keep asking
where they took her,

18:48.828 --> 18:50.361
But we haven't asked why.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.363
I mean, they already got
what they wanted from you,

18:52.365 --> 18:54.465
So...

18:54.467 --> 18:57.535
Mickle, what are you
doing here?

18:57.537 --> 18:59.570
I brought some people
to see you.

19:01.406 --> 19:02.840
What the hell is going on?

19:02.842 --> 19:04.876
It's not what you think,
hank.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.210
They can help.

19:06.212 --> 19:08.779
How?
I told them
what you saw.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.915
The olive trees,
vespers.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.251
Mateus vespers,
to be precise.

19:13.253 --> 19:16.587
A man we've been looking for
for 500 years.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.656
I'm not dealing
with these people.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.191
They tried to kill me.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.426
Hank,
you're the rationalist.

19:22.428 --> 19:25.630
If we wanted you dead
at this moment, you would be.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.533
The fact is, your life
and death mean nothing now.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.868
The pyrates have taken
what they wanted.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.904
They have the blood of christ.

19:32.906 --> 19:35.473
And only you...

19:35.475 --> 19:37.775
Seem to know
where they've taken it.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.411
It was a dream.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.713
No, hank.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.383
It was a vision.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.286
You saw into the past.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.930
1452--

19:58.932 --> 20:00.698
There was a schism
in the church

20:00.700 --> 20:03.534
Over chapter 7 of revelations,

20:03.536 --> 20:08.239
Where it is written
that 144,000 people

20:08.241 --> 20:11.676
Will be saved
when the end of days comes.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.844
Who are the 144,000?

20:13.846 --> 20:15.413
If you ask the pyrates,

20:15.415 --> 20:17.548
Only the descendants
of the 12 tribes of israel.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.451
Holy bloodlines,
noblemen, clergy,

20:20.453 --> 20:22.787
Captains of industry
and commerce--The powerful.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.455
But the church disagreed,

20:24.457 --> 20:27.992
Saying salvation
was for all christians.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.927
So the pyrates broke
with the church,

20:29.929 --> 20:33.431
Went to the mount of olives
in the dead of night

20:33.433 --> 20:36.834
And stole branches
from the sacred trees.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.270
Why?
Scripture says

20:39.272 --> 20:42.540
<i>The apocalypse will begin
not at the mount of olives</i>

20:42.542 --> 20:44.609
In jerusalem,

20:44.611 --> 20:46.377
But instead
a new mount of olives

20:46.379 --> 20:48.412
In a new jerusalem.

20:48.414 --> 20:52.316
So... the pyrates
decided to just make one?

20:52.318 --> 20:54.585
Give the apocalypse
a little nudge?

20:54.587 --> 20:58.556
The shepherds have been
looking for this new jerusalem

20:58.558 --> 21:01.392
For 500 years.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.995
And somehow...

21:03.997 --> 21:06.397
You saw it, hank.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.534
I didn't see anything.

21:10.536 --> 21:14.205
After all you've
witnessed...

21:18.010 --> 21:22.513
Why do you find it hard
to believe

21:22.515 --> 21:25.650
That maybe god
visited you?!

21:29.388 --> 21:31.656
That maybe he

21:31.658 --> 21:34.492
Put those images
in your head?

21:36.995 --> 21:39.563
Because if i were him,

21:39.565 --> 21:42.733
I wouldn't choose
hank galliston.

21:42.735 --> 21:46.637
Saul was a nonbeliever, too,

21:46.639 --> 21:51.575
Until the lord
showed him a vision

21:51.577 --> 21:54.445
On the road to damascus.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.080
Saul was a saint.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.549
I am an editor
of a magazine.

21:58.551 --> 22:02.653
With a missing staff writer
who i desperately want back.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.389
What we want
is in the same place.

22:05.391 --> 22:08.492
Do you think this is
where they've gone?

22:08.494 --> 22:09.827
This new jerusalem?

22:09.829 --> 22:12.863
The pyrates have waited
five centuries

22:12.865 --> 22:15.466
For this moment.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.068
It's the only place
they'd go.

22:20.372 --> 22:23.541
What did you see, hank?
Where are they?

22:48.934 --> 22:51.836
They turn on me,
it's on you, mickle.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.071
I only agreed to do this
because of you.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.606
Trust me,
where we're going,

22:55.608 --> 22:57.508
You're gonna want
every one of them.

22:58.910 --> 23:02.446
This pilot says he can
get us to the interior.

23:02.448 --> 23:03.647
In this thing?

23:03.649 --> 23:07.918
It's tajikistan.
Take what you can get.

23:09.454 --> 23:11.155
Beck, you ready?

23:12.657 --> 23:14.759
I'm trying to decide if i'm
hoping he's there or not.

23:16.628 --> 23:20.431
Something good has to come out
of all of this for someone.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.600
Maybe it's you.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.435
Yeah.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.679
It's been two hours since
the fertilization procedure.

23:35.681 --> 23:38.616
She's stable.
Resting comfortably.

23:38.618 --> 23:41.419
Her body--It's accepted
the d.N.A.?

23:41.421 --> 23:42.820
It would appear so.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.591
Not again.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.527
Blood pressure's dropping.

23:49.529 --> 23:52.029
I've never seen it fall
this fast. It--

23:52.031 --> 23:54.565
It's like the life
is being drained out of her.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.435
Son of a bitch!

23:57.437 --> 23:59.437
E.E.G.'S flatlining.

23:59.439 --> 24:02.006
Will someone tell me
what is happening to her?

24:08.647 --> 24:10.614
All nerve activity
in her head...

24:11.784 --> 24:13.451
Just stopped.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.898
He says
there's nothing out here,

24:27.900 --> 24:29.800
No military installations,
nothing that would warrant

24:29.802 --> 24:31.502
Any kind of blackout.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.841
He says the terrain's so bad,

24:36.843 --> 24:39.076
Not even tajiks come this far.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.583
What is it, hank?

24:45.585 --> 24:48.652
The three mountains--
It's what i saw in my dream.

24:55.794 --> 24:57.761
What the hell is happening
to me?

25:00.265 --> 25:02.199
I can't do this anymore.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.635
You say that like you have
a choice, dr. Riley.

25:04.637 --> 25:05.970
This doesn't trouble you?

25:05.972 --> 25:07.805
Having blood on your hands
like this?

25:07.807 --> 25:09.273
Blood on my hands?

25:09.275 --> 25:12.142
Have you forgotten what
we're trying to achieve here?

25:12.144 --> 25:15.145
We're talking about deliverance
into the kingdom of heaven.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.681
Every one of us
is going to die.

25:19.584 --> 25:20.751
You're out of your mind.

25:25.657 --> 25:27.091
Say that again.

25:32.297 --> 25:34.798
We have an array
of young women

25:34.800 --> 25:37.067
Still available to us,

25:37.069 --> 25:40.137
All with different
genetic makeup.

25:40.139 --> 25:43.707
We just haven't found
the right optimum host.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.811
So why don't you find us one?

25:58.690 --> 26:00.291
Rachel.

26:47.672 --> 26:49.373
I understand.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.241
She goes back.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.920
I understand
there was a development.

27:02.922 --> 27:05.255
Turns out we didn't need
another.
What do you mean?

27:05.257 --> 27:08.092
She stabilized--
Blood pressure, e.E.G.

27:08.094 --> 27:11.161
Everything suddenly
went back to normal,

27:11.163 --> 27:13.364
Like someone rebooted
her system.

27:13.366 --> 27:16.133
And the fertilization?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.401
Still viable.

27:19.338 --> 27:22.272
Then she carries
the child.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.397
Navigation's down, he's saying.
Comms, too!

27:51.704 --> 27:53.203
He's dumping his fuel!

27:53.205 --> 27:56.874
He's telling everyone to brace!
We're going down!

28:17.296 --> 28:19.296
What the hell happened?

28:19.298 --> 28:20.864
He says it just died.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.232
He's never seen anything
like it before.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.868
All systems at once.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.938
We lost two.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.340
Tried calling out,
but no signal.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.488
Something's happening.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.825
What did they do to you?

29:25.096 --> 29:26.964
I'm still trying
to understand...

29:26.966 --> 29:29.266
Why you let her go.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.068
I mean, the amount of tests
we still need to run...

29:31.070 --> 29:32.803
Let her rest.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.905
She's served her purpose.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.106
They were always
just going to be

29:36.108 --> 29:37.775
The first round
of experiments.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.409
You must have known that.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.779
They have the bodies

29:41.781 --> 29:43.781
For pregnancy, certainly,

29:43.783 --> 29:46.283
But the wisdom,
the spiritual certitude

29:46.285 --> 29:48.886
To follow this through?

29:48.888 --> 29:50.554
They're hardly more
than girls.

29:50.556 --> 29:53.223
She served her purpose.

29:53.225 --> 29:56.226
She proved it could be done.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.564
Now it's time
for the real work to begin.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.901
With the one that'll
actually bear the child.

30:05.103 --> 30:06.370
Then who?

30:10.909 --> 30:13.277
Oh, theo...

30:13.279 --> 30:14.912
Don't you know?

30:33.031 --> 30:35.532
If i asked you for help,

30:35.534 --> 30:37.601
Would you give it to me?

30:42.307 --> 30:44.875
You have great trust in you.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.109
Why is that?

30:49.347 --> 30:52.583
That's the way she raised you,

30:52.585 --> 30:54.184
Isn't it?

30:55.587 --> 30:59.189
So you would never question.

31:00.391 --> 31:01.592
We're outsiders here.

31:01.594 --> 31:04.628
Captive behind locked doors.

31:05.930 --> 31:10.067
If i didn't want to be here,

31:10.069 --> 31:11.635
Would you help me to leave?

31:14.172 --> 31:16.039
All right.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.976
My gun--Do you know
where it is?

31:21.579 --> 31:24.915
Would you get it for me?

31:49.675 --> 31:52.509
What are they saying?

31:52.511 --> 31:56.246
That it's impossible--
Fire burning on snow.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.516
The lake of fire
from revelations.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.451
It's a sign the end
has begun.

32:01.453 --> 32:05.289
It's just jet fuel
that the pilot dumped.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.457
Somehow it ignited.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.559
It's amazing that a man
with such sight

32:09.561 --> 32:12.362
Cannot see what's
right before him.

33:07.419 --> 33:10.520
They're gone! They're gone!

33:12.992 --> 33:14.091
What happened?!

33:14.093 --> 33:15.759
What happened?!

33:15.761 --> 33:19.596
The other four are gone!
Go back! Go back!

33:19.598 --> 33:21.498
Go easy, go easy!
Go easy!

33:21.500 --> 33:23.333
What are you talking about?

33:23.335 --> 33:24.501
Tell us!

33:24.503 --> 33:27.337
He's coming!

33:27.339 --> 33:29.706
Who's coming?

33:33.312 --> 33:36.279
It comes, it comes,
it comes...

33:36.281 --> 33:37.781
It comes, it comes, it comes,

33:37.783 --> 33:40.150
It comes.
Complete psychic break.
He can't tell us anything.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.685
He just keeps saying
the same thing

33:41.687 --> 33:43.787
Over and over and over.
The others are gone.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.722
No sign.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.425
The moon--
The moon is under her feet.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.427
<i>That's why--
That's why it comes.</i>

33:50.429 --> 33:51.695
<i>That's why it comes.</i>

33:51.697 --> 33:54.698
The beast--
It comes for her.
For who?

33:54.700 --> 33:57.667
For... the woman, the woman.
For the woman,

33:57.669 --> 33:59.036
For she is with child.

34:00.471 --> 34:02.272
It's taken.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.774
<i>She is with child.</i>

34:03.776 --> 34:05.575
<i>What he's saying
is revelations--</i>

34:05.577 --> 34:08.512
<i>Chapter 12, first 2 verses.</i>

34:08.514 --> 34:10.047
"And there appeared..."

34:10.049 --> 34:11.815
"Appeared a great dragon.

34:11.817 --> 34:15.652
"His--His tail
drew the third part

34:15.654 --> 34:18.388
"Of the stars of heaven,
and he cast them to the earth.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.358
"The dragon came
for the woman,

34:21.360 --> 34:24.161
"To devour her child...

34:24.163 --> 34:25.695
As soon as it is born."

35:16.781 --> 35:20.750
Seems he has more fidelity
to you than he does me.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.753
After all these years
i've reared him.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.356
He's incapable of saying no,
isn't he?

35:26.358 --> 35:28.792
Which was always
the experiment--

35:28.794 --> 35:31.795
To see if i had
the maternal instinct

35:31.797 --> 35:34.164
To take a cloned child--

35:34.166 --> 35:38.802
An imperfect result
of experimentation--

35:38.804 --> 35:41.171
And create something
angelic.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.541
He has no hate...

35:45.910 --> 35:47.577
Nor will he.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.317
He's yours if you want him.

35:55.586 --> 35:59.156
His relationship with me
was never to be forever.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.558
Or perhaps you'd like
to shoot me.

36:08.232 --> 36:10.867
I want to be fixed.

36:10.869 --> 36:13.436
Which is why you brokered
a deal with galliston

36:13.438 --> 36:17.274
Back on plum island
behind my back.

36:17.276 --> 36:21.178
Just as you brokered one
with him behind my back.

36:22.813 --> 36:24.814
You think i don't know
everything that happens

36:24.816 --> 36:26.583
Under my watch?

36:26.585 --> 36:29.419
You don't think i made sure
what ended up

36:29.421 --> 36:32.589
In that needle galliston used?

36:32.591 --> 36:34.791
Yes, vincent.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.560
I can fix you.

36:36.562 --> 36:39.763
Repair every genetic
imperfection

36:39.765 --> 36:42.365
So that you may actually
be human.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.568
But you, of course, will have
to do one last thing for me.

36:46.671 --> 36:49.239
You have wondered,
haven't you, why you're here?

36:50.341 --> 36:52.342
Because...

36:52.344 --> 36:56.980
You are one of the 144,000.

36:59.517 --> 37:02.652
Despite your current
iteration,

37:02.654 --> 37:05.922
The blood you come from
hearkens back through germany,

37:05.924 --> 37:07.958
Through the dietrich family,
all the way back

37:07.960 --> 37:11.328
To the 12 tribes of israel.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.296
I...

37:13.298 --> 37:15.599
You've got holy blood,
vincent.

37:15.601 --> 37:18.268
Not only can we fix you,

37:18.270 --> 37:19.803
We can save you.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.672
But you need to do
one last thing.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.941
Raise your gun a final time

37:24.943 --> 37:27.811
In service
of a greater mercy.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.946
You want me to kill.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.682
That is what you were
put on this earth for.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.918
I think you'd agree.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.921
Who?

37:39.690 --> 37:42.259
Come, my beautiful girls.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.495
All these months
and years

37:45.497 --> 37:48.698
We've tried to please
god, haven't we?

37:48.700 --> 37:51.968
The prayers, the study,
the service.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.005
I think he's so pleased.

38:04.682 --> 38:07.951
I just came in
to tell you that,

38:07.953 --> 38:10.854
And to make sure you know

38:10.856 --> 38:12.722
That this is not the end.

38:13.824 --> 38:16.860
It's just a doorway
to better things, right?

38:25.736 --> 38:27.937
I love you all.

38:37.415 --> 38:39.816
We need to get out of here.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.418
Now.

38:51.529 --> 38:53.330
I don't want them
to suffer.

38:53.332 --> 38:56.966
I know they're not the chosen,
but they have served god.

38:56.968 --> 39:01.004
I'd rather they die now
than witness what'll come next.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.838
May i raise him
to the light, lord...
