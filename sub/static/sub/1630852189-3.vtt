Touch Glyn again and I'll kill you.

00:03.550 --> 00:04.625
You'll kill me?!

00:05.600 --> 00:09.350
Been on the phone with Liverpool.
I've been offered the job.

00:09.625 --> 00:12.375
It's the next logical step for me.
Yes - for you.

00:12.650 --> 00:15.600
When I think of the future,
I think in terms of 'us'.

00:17.725 --> 00:20.425
What's wrong with her?
Don't ask.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.300
Your mother would've wanted you
to forgive and move on.

00:24.575 --> 00:26.300
Why are you saying that now?

00:26.575 --> 00:29.650
At 10.36pm,
Ifan Williams goes out for a smoke.

00:29.775 --> 00:32.575
Do we have a name?
Piotr Korecki.

00:33.225 --> 00:35.525
We'd better bring him in right now.

I don't know.

03:49.325 --> 03:50.475
A while.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.650
What did he want?

03:53.775 --> 03:54.775
Nothing.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.575
What did you talk about then?

04:00.225 --> 04:03.200
He was talking about
the man that got killed.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.550
What did he say about him?

04:11.300 --> 04:14.300
He was asking where you were
on Monday night.

04:16.425 --> 04:17.650
And what did you say?

04:17.775 --> 04:19.725
I told him you went to the pub.

04:21.525 --> 04:22.650
Your face.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.200
Who did it?

04:29.250 --> 04:31.600
I bumped into Marc on the estate.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.625
I couldn't help myself.

04:34.750 --> 04:39.700
You shouldn't have done that, Sion.
You've got to be careful out there.

04:45.575 --> 04:46.575
Listen to me.

04:48.675 --> 04:53.550
The only thing you can trust
is this.

04:55.175 --> 04:56.175
OK?

05:04.300 --> 05:06.525
Ti a fi.

05:10.175 --> 05:12.325
I'll always look after you, Glyn.

05:15.375 --> 05:18.300
And if that priest
comes over here again...

05:19.525 --> 05:22.350

08:24.550 --> 08:25.675
What do you think?

08:26.175 --> 08:28.525
He was caught on CCTV
assaulting Ifan.

08:28.650 --> 08:30.600
He made a run for it on arrest.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.225
Doesn't look good for him.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.250
Mm.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.550
What's bothering you?
I don't know.

08:41.675 --> 08:43.375
You saw that reaction.

08:44.275 --> 08:46.250
Panic. Fear.

08:46.375 --> 08:48.175
Perhaps it's just guilt.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.300
Perhaps.

08:51.550 --> 08:53.750
Let's wait and see
what forensics say.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.750
Get onto Europol in the morning.
See if they have anything on record.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.750
I'm heading off
before it gets pointless.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.525

I know you're angry
but we need to talk about this.

You're early.
Good morning to you too.

11:58.600 --> 12:02.325
It seems there was a bit of trouble
on the estate last night.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.550
A few locals got a bit rowdy...

12:05.675 --> 12:07.525
..and threw some bottles.

12:07.650 --> 12:10.675
Great. Let's run
a Community Impact Assessment.

12:11.325 --> 12:13.500

12:14.250 --> 12:17.300
Kid gloves though.
Let's not make things worse.

12:18.575 --> 12:22.775
One of the PCs mentioned a local
priest who helped calm things down.

12:23.425 --> 12:25.200
OK. Find out who he is.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.325
Where are you going?
I need to do something.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.225
Can you hold the fort for a bit?
Sure.

12:37.675 --> 12:39.450
I need to go to the farm...

12:39.575 --> 12:42.350
..to let them know
we've made an arrest.

12:42.625 --> 12:45.300
Keep me in the loop.
Of course.

12:46.175 --> 12:47.300
Oh, and Boss?

12:48.425 --> 12:51.450
Get yourself a coffee.
You look like shit.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.375
You look terrible.

14:02.225 --> 14:03.225
Diolch.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.750
You're not going to work, are you?
What do you think?

14:22.450 --> 14:23.450

14:24.475 --> 14:25.475
Follow me.

14:34.350 --> 14:36.250
Here you go. For your birds.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.525
Are you sure don't need them?
I'm sure.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.600
Did you sack the maid or something?

14:48.425 --> 14:49.425
No.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.675
She moved on.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.650
Someone had to.

14:55.300 --> 14:58.350
I don't know what's going on
with you, Sion...

14:58.475 --> 15:00.375
..but this has got to stop.

15:00.675 --> 15:03.500
You can't call me
like you did last night.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.275
I know it was you.

15:07.225 --> 15:09.475
It's not fair. You finished with me.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.775
You can't call me...

15:13.275 --> 15:16.500
..and expect me to be there
whenever you want me.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.625
OK.

15:19.325 --> 15:20.350
No, it's not OK.

15:20.475 --> 15:23.700
The next time you want me
late at night you'll phone again.

15:24.450 --> 15:26.375
You've made your point.

15:27.650 --> 15:30.600
I won't follow the same pattern
over and over.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.250
I can't.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.475
Great.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.225
You can be a real dick
sometimes, Sion.

15:43.450 --> 15:46.500
I'm sorry about
everything you've been through...

15:46.625 --> 15:47.650
..I really am...

15:48.300 --> 15:50.700
..but you don't have a monopoly
on pain.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.200
You OK?

15:57.325 --> 15:58.350
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:58.475 --> 15:59.475
We're fine.

16:01.550 --> 16:03.300
Everything's alright.

16:36.775 --> 16:37.775
Cadi.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.500
You wouldn't answer your phone.

16:41.175 --> 16:42.475
Is this work related?

16:42.750 --> 16:46.250
Then it can wait.
Rach, please!

16:47.275 --> 16:50.275
I want to be with you.
This job won't change that.

16:50.550 --> 16:53.550
I can come back every weekend.
Liverpool isn't far.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.425
It's only a couple of hours.
Cadi, stop!

16:56.700 --> 16:59.525
Don't try to gloss over
what you've done.

16:59.650 --> 17:02.300
You applied for a job
without telling me.

17:02.425 --> 17:04.500
You had an interview
without telling me.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.350
I couldn't tell you until I knew...
Cadi, come on!

17:07.625 --> 17:09.350
You could have told me.

17:09.475 --> 17:12.500
You could have shared it
but you chose not to.

17:15.350 --> 17:18.175
I didn't think.
That's the problem.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.450
You didn't think about me.

17:20.575 --> 17:22.175
About us.

17:31.650 --> 17:34.275
You knew I was driven
when you met me.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.450
That's not what this is about.
I'm not trying to hold you back.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.450
I haven't got time
to do this right now.

17:42.575 --> 17:45.475
I don't see how this changes things.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.600
It already has changed things.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.375
Look, I have to go.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.350
I've got work to do.

17:51.650 --> 17:52.650
So do you.

18:07.775 --> 18:09.775
HE RINGS THE DOORBELL

18:19.300 --> 18:20.300
Come in.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.750
I'll make you some tea now.

18:31.250 --> 18:32.625
Don't go to any trouble.

18:32.750 --> 18:35.250
It's fine. I'm making some anyway.
Thank you.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.400
Are you going to be a farmer?

18:44.350 --> 18:46.300
Do you like yellow tractors?

18:46.425 --> 18:48.650
Everyone knows
the red ones are the best.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.725
He should be in school
but it's just a bit too soon...

18:53.375 --> 18:54.575
..for both of us.

18:55.675 --> 18:56.675
Thank you.

18:57.175 --> 18:58.300
Have you got kids?

18:58.550 --> 18:59.550
Just the one.

19:00.750 --> 19:04.525
She's only little
but she's her own person already.

19:06.500 --> 19:11.275
It's like they've been here before.
His first word was 'tractor'!

19:16.250 --> 19:17.400
Hey, come on!

19:19.550 --> 19:21.350
Take these eggs to Granny.

19:21.625 --> 19:24.300
She might even boil one for you.

19:36.250 --> 19:39.275
I came to tell you
that an arrest was made last night.

19:40.525 --> 19:44.200
Does the name Piotr Korecki
mean anything to you?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.750
No... who is he?

19:47.400 --> 19:51.475
He's a Polish builder
who works on the old hospital site.

19:57.775 --> 20:01.475
We had some Polish workers here
a few summers back...

20:02.475 --> 20:04.625
..but I don't remember that name.

20:04.750 --> 20:08.200
Would you have any records?
Yes, somewhere.

20:08.325 --> 20:10.475
Mair helped Ifan with that stuff.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.675
I can have a look.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.200
It must be difficult...

20:15.475 --> 20:18.350
..living so close
to your mother-in-law.

20:19.725 --> 20:22.175
It's good for Guto...

20:22.550 --> 20:24.450
..but it's not always easy.

20:24.575 --> 20:26.625
I was born 20 miles from here...

20:26.750 --> 20:29.300
..but farming's not in my family.

20:31.425 --> 20:33.425
It's a different world.

20:35.450 --> 20:39.200
When I first met Mair,
she offered me tea so I accepted.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.225
Thought I was being polite.

20:41.350 --> 20:44.575
Turns out I should've said no
two or three times...

20:44.700 --> 20:47.475
..so as not to come across
as demanding!

20:47.600 --> 20:49.200
There are rules.

20:49.325 --> 20:51.300
Invisible. Unwritten.

20:52.575 --> 20:55.400
A different language
that I can't speak.

20:55.525 --> 20:57.625
I've given up trying to learn it.

21:00.650 --> 21:04.550
The only good thing to come out of
the whole thing was Guto.

21:05.450 --> 21:08.275
The offer
of a Family Liaison Officer...

21:08.475 --> 21:09.600
..still stands.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.275
It's OK to change your mind.

21:13.525 --> 21:15.725
You don't have to cope on your own.

21:18.325 --> 21:21.325
I've been coping on my own
for years.

23:40.325 --> 23:44.675
The LIO reports.
I'm afraid they're all handwritten.

23:45.325 --> 23:49.175
I went through them and put them
in order but I'm not sure it helps.

23:49.450 --> 23:50.450
Thanks, Alys.

23:50.575 --> 23:54.550
The duty sergeant's been in touch
about Piotr Korecki.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.425
He's refusing food.

23:56.550 --> 23:58.350
He's a mess, apparently.

23:58.475 --> 23:59.475
OK, thanks.

24:00.475 --> 24:02.700
Coffee?
You're a lifesaver.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.325
Oh, and I set up a meeting for you
in the church.

24:06.600 --> 24:09.300
Vaughan will meet you there.
Great.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.350
Yeah, OK. See you later.

25:08.275 --> 25:09.275
BANGS ON DOOR

25:09.400 --> 25:10.400
Mam!

25:11.575 --> 25:12.575
Mam!

25:15.400 --> 25:16.400
Mam!

25:16.525 --> 25:18.525
BANGS ON THE DOOR

25:19.575 --> 25:20.575
Mam!

25:22.625 --> 25:23.625
Mam!

25:36.325 --> 25:37.325
You OK?

25:37.450 --> 25:38.625
Yeah, just great.

25:39.450 --> 25:42.250
This day just keeps getting better.

25:47.225 --> 25:48.500
Father McEwan?

25:50.175 --> 25:52.650
DCI Cadi John.
This is DS Owen Vaughan.

25:52.775 --> 25:54.650
Thank you for seeing us.

25:55.375 --> 25:58.450
I'm sure you're very busy.
Is this about Ifan Williams?

25:59.350 --> 26:02.175
Did you know him?
I knew of him.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.425
Of his family.

26:04.325 --> 26:06.725
Their roots are deep in this area.

26:08.325 --> 26:09.325
Take a seat.

26:09.450 --> 26:10.450
Thank you.

26:14.175 --> 26:16.425
How long
have you been a priest here?

26:21.200 --> 26:22.575
Too long, some might say.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.775
Twenty years.

26:25.525 --> 26:28.400
The community must've changed
over the years.

26:28.675 --> 26:30.775
Not as much as you'd think.

26:31.600 --> 26:35.525
This place has always attracted
a mix of people.

26:36.250 --> 26:38.650
The mines drew people
from everywhere.

26:38.775 --> 26:41.675
More recently, it's Polish people.

26:42.350 --> 26:43.350
Mm.

26:43.475 --> 26:45.325
How has that worked?

26:46.700 --> 26:49.575
The Welsh and the Polish
are very similar.

26:49.700 --> 26:51.550
Reserved in nature.

26:52.475 --> 26:55.375
Worried about
what other people think.

26:56.450 --> 27:00.625
I spent a few years in Poland myself
when I was a student.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.650
It's been really good
for the church.

27:07.275 --> 27:10.500
You know Piotr Korecki and his wife.

27:12.350 --> 27:13.475
Of course.

27:13.750 --> 27:19.225
Were you aware of any tension
between him and Ifan Williams?

27:19.675 --> 27:21.175
No.

27:21.425 --> 27:24.325
I couldn't believe it
when he was arrested.

27:25.725 --> 27:29.650
It seems so unlikely
that he'd be involved.

27:29.775 --> 27:30.775
Why?

27:31.275 --> 27:34.550
You get a sense
of people's character...

27:35.375 --> 27:37.525
..when you see them every Sunday.

27:38.575 --> 27:41.600
Of course,
I can't go into any detail.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.675
What's said in Confession
is sacred...

27:45.325 --> 27:46.625
..between them and God.

27:46.750 --> 27:49.650
We visited
Dafydd O'Connell yesterday.

27:50.325 --> 27:51.500
Do you know him?

27:52.500 --> 27:53.500
Yes, I do.

27:53.625 --> 27:56.750
He used to come to church regularly.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.200
And now?

27:59.725 --> 28:02.725
People lose faith and find it again.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.500
It's not my place to judge.

28:06.625 --> 28:09.175
He worked for Ifan Williams
for years.

28:09.475 --> 28:12.175
Were you aware of that?
Yes.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.500
He gave his life to that place.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.450
Yes, then he left suddenly.

28:19.200 --> 28:22.525
It's fair to say
it was pretty much over...

28:22.650 --> 28:25.250
..when Ifan's father died.

28:25.525 --> 28:28.600
There was no love lost
between Ifan and Dafydd.

28:28.725 --> 28:30.750
They were very different people.
In what way?

28:31.400 --> 28:35.200
Dafydd wanted to work
for the land...

28:36.375 --> 28:39.625
..and Ifan wanted the land
to work for him.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.725
RUMBLES OF THUNDER

29:54.325 --> 29:55.325
Dion?

29:56.375 --> 29:57.375
You OK?

29:58.475 --> 30:00.575
Locked out. Forgot my key.

30:01.425 --> 30:05.175
Do you want to come in for a bit,
until your mum comes back?

31:51.775 --> 31:53.175
Mam?

31:53.300 --> 31:54.750
What are you doing?

31:57.275 --> 31:58.275
Nothing.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.725
This is Dad's room.
Yes, I know.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.400
It's OK.

32:04.300 --> 32:05.300
Come here.

32:07.325 --> 32:08.750
Everything's OK.

32:16.550 --> 32:18.500
I think...
This one.

32:21.650 --> 32:23.200
BANGING ON THE DOOR

32:23.325 --> 32:24.725
Dion! Open the door!

32:25.700 --> 32:27.650
I know you're in there.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.250
Dion?

32:30.375 --> 32:31.700
I'm not messing about.

32:33.475 --> 32:35.275
Open this door now!

32:36.600 --> 32:37.600
Dion!

32:38.650 --> 32:40.275
Where is he?

32:40.575 --> 32:41.575
Dion?

32:43.775 --> 32:45.450
What have I told you?

32:46.300 --> 32:48.475
Home!
But it was raining.

32:48.775 --> 32:50.275
He was being nice.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.500
Home. Now!

32:58.525 --> 33:01.700
I swear to God, if you've touched
a hair on his head...

33:02.350 --> 33:04.300
..I'll fucking kill you.

33:27.250 --> 33:30.325
SHE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR
You wanted a word?

33:30.450 --> 33:32.525
Europol just came back to me.

33:33.175 --> 33:36.200
It seems they have no record
of Piotr Korecki.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.725
They've got nothing on him?
Apparently not.

33:41.225 --> 33:43.525
Sorry, that's not much help, is it?

33:45.450 --> 33:46.450
What is it?

33:47.425 --> 33:49.675
The image of him assaulting Ifan...

33:50.175 --> 33:53.350
..is at odds with
what people say about him.

33:53.475 --> 33:57.450
I was hoping a little of his history
would make things clearer.

33:57.575 --> 34:00.575
He'll be here overnight
until we hear from forensics.

34:01.225 --> 34:02.650
Right... back to it then.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.375
Cadi.

34:05.650 --> 34:06.725
A word of advice.

34:07.225 --> 34:08.425
Go home.

34:09.325 --> 34:13.675
Sometimes a breakthrough comes
when we think about something else.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.400
What's going on?

34:48.275 --> 34:50.750
Your brother.
That's what's going on.

34:51.500 --> 34:52.525
What's he done?

34:53.250 --> 34:58.300
Keep that idiot away from my boy.
What the fuck are you trying to say?

34:58.575 --> 35:02.650
Unless you want to make a formal
complaint, I suggest you go home.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.200
I think that's enough for one day.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.500
Do you?

35:12.725 --> 35:14.550
You - inside!

35:16.625 --> 35:17.625
Glyn?

35:18.350 --> 35:19.350
Glyn!

35:20.175 --> 35:21.750
Glyn, ti'n oce?

35:22.425 --> 35:25.200
Apparently Dion, the child...

35:25.475 --> 35:26.600
..forgot his key.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.775
Glyn hasn't spoken since we arrived.

35:29.450 --> 35:32.375
He wouldn't hurt anyone.
He just wouldn't.

35:32.650 --> 35:33.775
Fuck!

35:34.275 --> 35:35.425
Who the fuck does she think she is?

35:35.550 --> 35:36.550
I understand.

35:36.675 --> 35:38.775
No, you don't understand.

35:39.775 --> 35:42.350
Has there been any tension before?

35:43.725 --> 35:45.575
Her son's a good kid...

35:47.700 --> 35:50.700
..but a while back
he came into our garden...

35:51.200 --> 35:53.300
..and got stuck in Glyn's shed.

35:53.575 --> 35:56.725
Got himself in a state. Panicked.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.175
She blamed it all on Glyn.

35:59.450 --> 36:03.175
We can talk to her if you like.
It would be pointless.

36:03.450 --> 36:05.375
It would make no difference.

36:05.650 --> 36:07.500
What happened to your face?

36:11.175 --> 36:12.175
Accident.

36:12.450 --> 36:16.250
At the building site?
Yes.

36:19.175 --> 36:21.550
If you have any more problems,
give us a call.

36:22.650 --> 36:25.550
In the meantime,
keep out of each other's way.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.550
He did nothing wrong.
Why should we keep out of their way?

36:29.675 --> 36:33.450
I was thinking of your brother.
It'd be less stressful for him.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
It was nice to meet you, Glyn.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.450
We'll let ourselves out.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.250
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

36:49.725 --> 36:51.500
Ty'd laen.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.425
Come on.

36:59.775 --> 37:01.275
Glyn?

37:16.600 --> 37:18.225
Get your coat.

37:19.425 --> 37:20.675
We're going out.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.600
LAUGHTER

37:53.425 --> 37:56.500
Good grief! She's here!
What's this?

37:57.300 --> 37:59.450
Thought we'd toast the old place.

37:59.575 --> 38:01.500
Here you go.
Thanks.

38:04.625 --> 38:06.725
To Dad.
To Dad.

38:11.275 --> 38:13.600
Well, we got there in the end.

38:13.725 --> 38:17.700
You've worked so hard, Beth.
It's all done, at least.

38:18.450 --> 38:20.400
It just looks so empty.

38:25.275 --> 38:26.275
Right.

38:26.775 --> 38:30.275
Let's light this fire one last time.

38:43.575 --> 38:46.300
Come on. The food's not that bad!

38:56.600 --> 38:58.600
You didn't do anything wrong.

39:00.725 --> 39:02.450
You did a good thing.

39:04.725 --> 39:07.250
A kind thing, letting that boy in.

39:08.625 --> 39:09.625
It was her.

39:11.425 --> 39:13.350
She was bang out of order.

39:18.725 --> 39:21.625
You shouldn't have to
change the way you are.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.275
It's the world that needs to change.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.725
I'll listen next time.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.500
There are people that...

39:38.175 --> 39:40.275
They'll walk all over you.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.625
Like Marc?

39:46.550 --> 39:48.700
Mm! Like Marc.

39:52.250 --> 39:54.300
Thanks for sticking up for me.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.200
I'll always stick up for you.
You know that.

40:01.200 --> 40:04.700
We're on the same team, aren't we?
Ti a fi.

40:07.650 --> 40:08.725
Of course we are.

40:11.625 --> 40:13.325
I'm glad I've got you.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.375
Caru ti, Sion.

40:30.750 --> 40:32.725
Stay here. I'll be back now.

40:46.425 --> 40:48.425
HE SOBS

41:05.225 --> 41:06.550
They've got three kids.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.225
The new owners.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.275
I like that.

41:11.550 --> 41:13.575
They'll have this place...

41:14.225 --> 41:16.275
..and make memories, like we did.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.675
We're all just passing through.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.250
There's a cheery thought!

41:22.625 --> 41:26.775
Let's hope none of them sneaks out
of their bedrooms at night...

41:27.275 --> 41:29.475
..and sets off a coastguard rescue.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.450
I was looking at the stars.

41:32.325 --> 41:35.400
They didn't look for me for long!
Dad didn't kick off.

41:35.675 --> 41:37.375
I couldn't believe it.

41:37.500 --> 41:38.500
KNOCK ON DOOR

41:40.300 --> 41:41.550
I'll go.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.575
It was a brilliant place to grow up.

41:51.225 --> 41:54.200
Who else gets to live
on their own island?

41:58.350 --> 42:00.400
Rachel! Get yourself a glass.

42:00.675 --> 42:04.650
We're reminiscing.
No, thanks. I don't want to intrude.

42:04.775 --> 42:06.625
You're not intruding.

42:07.425 --> 42:09.575
I just want a quick word with Cadi.

42:11.175 --> 42:12.425
Yeah, of course.

42:14.250 --> 42:15.525
Let's go downstairs.

42:26.725 --> 42:30.575
I didn't know you had company.
I wouldn't have come over.

42:30.700 --> 42:31.725
I'm glad you did.

42:35.700 --> 42:39.250
I've been thinking about
what you said all day...

42:40.475 --> 42:41.700
..and you're right.

42:43.675 --> 42:44.675
It's just...

42:45.725 --> 42:47.675
..I've moved around so much.

42:50.550 --> 42:54.275
You learn not to invest too heavily
in people.

42:56.375 --> 42:58.175
It's easier not to.

43:00.325 --> 43:01.325
What?

43:01.450 --> 43:03.500
So what you're saying is...

43:04.175 --> 43:07.425
..you keep everyone at arm's length
because it's easier.

43:07.550 --> 43:09.200
No, it's not that.

43:12.325 --> 43:16.525
I've seen the damage people can do.
So have I.

43:20.300 --> 43:24.200
You know, I would've fallen for it
if I were younger.

43:27.325 --> 43:28.350
The mystery...

43:29.375 --> 43:32.550
..the desperation
of getting close to someone...

43:32.675 --> 43:34.700
..who was so near and yet so far.

43:35.350 --> 43:37.175
You know what?

43:37.600 --> 43:39.675
I'm too old for that now.

43:42.375 --> 43:45.250
I know what I want.
So do I.

43:45.675 --> 43:48.500
So why do you look over my shoulder?
I don't.

43:50.275 --> 43:52.400
The worst thing is...

43:53.575 --> 43:55.575
..I thought we had something.

43:57.275 --> 43:59.700
You're still searching
for something...

44:00.200 --> 44:02.500
..and I don't think you know
what it is.

44:02.775 --> 44:04.325
I want you...

44:05.425 --> 44:09.700
You say all the right things
but you don't mean them, not really.

44:10.600 --> 44:13.350
You're just used to
having your own way.

44:14.625 --> 44:16.275
Don't lie to me, Cadi.

44:17.500 --> 44:21.675
Don't lie to yourself either.
You're worth more than that.

44:34.575 --> 44:36.250
Rach, please...?

44:44.675 --> 44:46.700
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

46:12.675 --> 46:14.300
Our Father...

46:17.275 --> 46:19.675
..who art in Heaven...

46:24.275 --> 46:26.500
..hallowed be Thy name.

46:30.475 --> 46:32.525
Thy kingdom come...

46:34.275 --> 46:37.500
..thy will be done...

46:40.175 --> 46:45.400
..on earth as it is in Heaven.

46:48.650 --> 46:52.725
Give us this day our daily bread...

46:56.375 --> 46:59.375
..and forgive us our trespasses...

47:00.725 --> 47:05.575
..as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

47:07.725 --> 47:11.425
And lead us not into temptation...

47:13.675 --> 47:16.675
..but deliver us from evil.

47:20.750 --> 47:23.600
For thine is the kingdom...

47:24.775 --> 47:29.275
..the power...

47:29.650 --> 47:31.400
..and the glory.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.675
For ever and ever.

47:50.650 --> 47:51.775
Amen.

48:25.500 --> 48:28.250
DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS SHUT
