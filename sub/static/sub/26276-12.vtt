from an old military buddy,

08:55.143 --> 08:56.927
and he's gonna be able
to patch us through.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.800
The problem is he's in the
middle of a mission right now.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.236
That's why you need my computer.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.759
You need
an encrypted connection.

09:03.978 --> 09:06.241
Very well.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.678
You have permission
to give the man my number.

09:13.727 --> 09:16.381

09:18.340 --> 09:20.385
Y-You're making a soldier wait.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.345
Fine.

09:24.389 --> 09:26.435
Thank you.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.612
Mr. Magnum, sir.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.092
Staff Sergeant Howl.

09:31.135 --> 09:34.486
First of all, I want to offer
my deepest condolences.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.098
Thank you, sir.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.926
You must have some friends
in high places

09:38.969 --> 09:40.362
to make this commo shot happen.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.016
Yeah, I have a few.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.061
How you holding up?

09:44.105 --> 09:47.978
If I can be honest...
it's been hard.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.763
All I can do is suck it up.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.853
I understand. Unfortunately.

09:52.896 --> 09:57.161
I know what it's like to lose
a parent while serving overseas.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.294
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.Yeah, it was a...

09:59.337 --> 10:01.644

10:01.688 --> 10:03.341
So, um...

10:03.385 --> 10:04.473

10:04.516 --> 10:06.301
I'm the company's
forward observer,

10:06.344 --> 10:08.390
so I don't want to leave
until my replacement gets here.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.827
Anyway, how can I help?

Well, the guy I'm looking for,

10:12.524 --> 10:13.830
Skip Jenkins--

10:13.874 --> 10:16.137
did your father
ever mention him?

10:16.180 --> 10:19.227
No, sir. First time I heard
his name was in the report.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.576
He was last seen
at your father's apartment

10:20.620 --> 10:22.099
after he skipped bail.
Can you think

10:22.143 --> 10:24.885
of any reason why
he would've gone there?

10:24.928 --> 10:26.756
Anything he might've
been looking for?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.105
I can't.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.107
But my dad's lived
in quite a few places

10:30.151 --> 10:31.456
over the years,

10:31.500 --> 10:33.458
and he keeps a lot of stuff
in a storage unit.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.983
I can send you the details
if that'd be helpful.Uh, yes.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.680
Very much so. That'd be great.

Sorry, sir,
but I should head out.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.341
Understood.

10:46.384 --> 10:51.172
Mr. Magnum, sir,
my father was a good man.

10:51.215 --> 10:54.044
A-All he ever wanted to do
was to serve others,

10:54.088 --> 10:55.785
and he's the reason
I'm doing the same.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.527
I want to help,
but I'm needed here.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.529
Promise me

11:00.572 --> 11:02.923
you'll do whatever you can to
get the guy who did this to him.

11:02.966 --> 11:06.100

to Barry's cloud.

info so that I can ping her?

Sure, if you can drop me off
at the rental car place in town.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm going in the, uh...

14:22.513 --> 14:25.821
the opposite direction,
but Magnum could give you

a lift on his way
to the nonprofit.

in the opposite direction.

14:39.704 --> 14:40.923
I don't think so, either.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.620
I honestly think she
likes me, but is afraid

14:42.664 --> 14:45.058

Okay, here we go.

Seriously?
Come on!

18:05.432 --> 18:07.129
Come on? This
wasn't my fault.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.391
Are-are you kidding me?

18:08.435 --> 18:09.958
You got to watch
where you're going!

18:10.001 --> 18:11.786
Me? You're the one
who slammed on the brakes.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.353
TC: Well, you're
the rear vehicle.

18:14.354 --> 18:15.746
Look at my bumper.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.793
It looks fine to me.[TC sighs]

18:18.836 --> 18:21.361
I can't believe this, man.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.537
You know what?

18:23.580 --> 18:25.408
I guess it's just
a scratch.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.715
Don't even
worry about it.

18:27.758 --> 18:30.152
Uh, great. Thanks.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.546
Sorry... about that.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.940
[van engine starts]

18:38.465 --> 18:40.641
Mahalo!Hey!

18:43.470 --> 18:44.601
HIGGINS:
So what is

18:44.645 --> 18:45.994
on this laptop, exactly?

18:46.037 --> 18:47.474
I don't know.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.998
You had TC get into an accident
for no reason at all?

18:50.041 --> 18:51.347
No, it's connected
to Barry's cloud.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.088
I want to see what
his recent activity was

18:53.132 --> 18:54.263
before he was murdered.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.569
Why didn't you
just say that?

18:57.397 --> 19:00.008
It looks like the last thing
Barry uploaded

19:00.051 --> 19:02.184
was a photo from his cell phone.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.273
I can't make out
the warehouse,

19:04.317 --> 19:05.753
or where it was taken from.

19:05.796 --> 19:10.105
Was it geotagged?Yes, but he deleted
the Exif data.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.368
English, please?It'll take a minute.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.721
Um... by the way,

19:17.765 --> 19:20.202
I had no idea
that you lost a parent

19:20.246 --> 19:21.595
while you were
in the military.

19:21.638 --> 19:22.900
[clears throat]

19:22.944 --> 19:24.511
I'm... I'm really sorry.

19:24.554 --> 19:27.470
Thanks.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.516
It was my mom.

19:29.559 --> 19:32.127
That must've been hard.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.912
I know it was
a long time ago,

19:34.956 --> 19:37.915
but if you ever want
to talk about it...

19:37.959 --> 19:39.961
Yeah.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.272
[computer beeps]Okay, got it.

19:46.315 --> 19:49.188
Barry took the photo
from a motel in Kunia.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.493
Oh, that's interesting.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.192
What is?One of Barry's

19:53.235 --> 19:54.845
other devices accessed the photo

19:54.889 --> 19:57.413
through the cloud
afterhe was killed.

19:57.457 --> 20:00.242
Skip must have found one
of Barry's devices

20:00.286 --> 20:01.504
at his apartment.

20:01.548 --> 20:02.766
Mm-hmm.He must still

20:02.810 --> 20:04.551
be after whatever it is
he killed Barry for.

20:04.594 --> 20:08.207
I'm gonna go check
out the motel.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.687
Oh, Thomas, uh,
just so you know,

20:10.731 --> 20:13.386
the 488 is on its way here
as we speak.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.170
Are you serious?

20:15.214 --> 20:17.607
Yes. You're chasing
after an accused killer.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.131
I can't have you putzing around
on a scooter.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.872
Thank you. So-so,
you paid my debt?

20:21.916 --> 20:23.526
No, I didn't.

20:23.570 --> 20:26.921
It's a loan, which I expect to
be repaid in full with interest.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.836
In the meantime...

20:30.272 --> 20:32.056
...take the black one.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.362
Are you kidding me?

20:37.932 --> 20:41.022
Thanks. I owe you one.One? More like 600.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.763
MAGNUM:
Don't get me wrong.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.634
I'm thankful
for Kumu's scooter,

20:44.678 --> 20:47.376
and its amazing gas mileage,
but if I'm right,

20:47.420 --> 20:49.639
and there's a chance
Skip is at this motel,

20:49.683 --> 20:52.120
I'd rather get there
in ten minutes than 30.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.165
[engine revving]

20:59.910 --> 21:01.434
Have you seen this guy?

21:01.477 --> 21:04.001
Yeah, he's in 212.
Right up there.

21:04.045 --> 21:05.525
MAGNUM: Sometimes being
a private investigator means

21:05.568 --> 21:06.917
playing a character.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.615
A handyman, a custodian,

21:08.658 --> 21:11.313
someone who can blend in so
you don't scare the skip away.

21:11.357 --> 21:14.621
But sometimes scaring the skip is exactly what you want to do.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.451
[pounding on door]

21:18.494 --> 21:20.670
Skip Jenkins?
HPD. Can we talk?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.281
[pounding]

21:25.762 --> 21:26.894
[pounding continues]

21:36.425 --> 21:38.340
Hey, Skip. Come here.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.473
[grunting]

21:40.516 --> 21:43.389
[quietly]:
Come on...

21:43.432 --> 21:44.781
[zip tie tightens]

21:44.825 --> 21:47.523
You got to believe me, man.
I didn't kill him.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.047
That's for the
courts to decide.

21:50.091 --> 21:52.006
Are you kidding me?
You know how guilty I look?

21:52.049 --> 21:53.747
Yeah, I do, actually.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.488
You were found standing over
his body covered in blood.

21:55.531 --> 21:57.490
That's because he was still
alive when I found him.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.361
What about your
previous altercations?

21:59.405 --> 22:01.798
Yeah, okay, we got into it
in the past,

22:01.842 --> 22:03.452
but it was never
anything personal.

22:03.496 --> 22:06.281
When I found him in the alley,
I wanted to save his life.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.936
All right? Tri-Tried to
stop the bleeding, okay,

22:08.979 --> 22:10.459
but it was too late.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.375
You went back
to Barry's apartment.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.377
Why?

22:15.421 --> 22:17.423
I went there to find out
who actually killed Barry.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.512
Think about it.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.427
Why would I risk being caught
by going back to his house?

22:23.254 --> 22:24.995
The only reason I ran was
to prove my innocence.

22:25.039 --> 22:28.390
And that's also why
you came out here?
Yes.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.870
Staking out that warehouse
across the street

22:29.913 --> 22:32.220
was the last thing Barry did
before he was killed.

22:32.263 --> 22:36.093
MAGNUM: I have a pretty good
track record following my gut,

22:36.137 --> 22:39.401
and right now, my gut says Skip could be telling the truth.

22:39.445 --> 22:42.099
Look, I know it's your
job to bring me in,

22:42.143 --> 22:44.406
but if you care about
who really killed Barry,

22:44.450 --> 22:46.582
I think the answer's
in that warehouse.

22:46.626 --> 22:49.193
MAGNUM: I know this job came
from a bail bondsman,

22:49.237 --> 22:51.457
but the second I made a promise to Sergeant Howl,

22:51.500 --> 22:53.154
he became my client.

22:53.197 --> 22:56.549
My promise to him wasn't to bring Skip in for a big reward.

22:56.592 --> 22:59.421
It was to get justice
for his dad.

22:59.465 --> 23:03.382
Okay, let's go find out
who the real killer is.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.830
SKIP: I've been here
most of the day scoping it out.

23:16.873 --> 23:19.876
The main thing I saw was
a few trucks going in and out.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.401
Did you get a look
at any of the drivers?

23:22.444 --> 23:24.228
See what they
were carrying?
No.

23:24.272 --> 23:25.926
But that's the old
Kula chocolate factory,

23:25.969 --> 23:27.623
and it's been shut down
for years.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.452
It's abandoned, so those trucks
have no reason to be there.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.106
I got to go check it out.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.803
What about me?

23:33.847 --> 23:35.631
Well...

23:35.675 --> 23:37.285
[clucking]Ow!

23:37.328 --> 23:40.331
Beaker, be gentle, not so rough.

23:40.375 --> 23:43.770
You are developing an unhealthy
relationship with poultry.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.424
You know,
it's a little-known fact,

23:45.467 --> 23:49.079
most chickens have the IQ
of a 13-year-old human child.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.647
That's not even
close to being true.

23:51.691 --> 23:53.475
Oh, come on, man.
You're just jealous

23:53.519 --> 23:54.868
'cause I'm making
some new friends.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.260
Yeah, you got me.

23:56.304 --> 23:57.871
I'm threatened by a
couple of dumb birds.

23:57.914 --> 24:00.482
You know what? Beaker, Chick
Norris and I are gonna pretend

24:00.526 --> 24:02.571
you didn't say that,
because you've been displaying

24:02.615 --> 24:05.226
such mad skills
putting that thing together.

24:05.269 --> 24:07.663
Speaking of mad skills... done.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.665
You ready to fire
this thing up?

24:09.709 --> 24:10.971
Wait, wait, wait.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.320
[clucking]

24:12.363 --> 24:13.713
What are you doing?

24:13.756 --> 24:15.802
Oh, I don't want them to watch.

24:15.845 --> 24:17.760
You see, uh, they're chickens,
and that's a grill.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.762
That's basically
like an electric chair to them.

24:19.806 --> 24:20.981
You got issues.

24:21.024 --> 24:23.810
Drums, please.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.856
[clangs]

24:31.165 --> 24:33.210
You know, I'm gonna
go ahead and take back

24:33.254 --> 24:35.212
that mad skills thing
I said earlier. You suck.

24:35.256 --> 24:36.387
[phone ringing]

24:38.651 --> 24:39.826
Hey.MAGNUM: Hey.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.436
Where you guys at?RICK: Where are we at

24:41.480 --> 24:43.612
on the island,
or where are we at putting

24:43.656 --> 24:46.659
your grill together for you
without you helping at all?

24:46.702 --> 24:48.269
[chuckling]: Okay, I get it.
You're at my place.

24:48.312 --> 24:49.488
Yeah. Why?

24:49.531 --> 24:52.360
Well, I need help,
but I'm in Kunia.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.667
Okay, well, we could head out
there right now,

24:54.710 --> 24:57.452
but if it's urgent, I'd call
somebody who lives out there.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.975
Hmm.

25:01.848 --> 25:04.067
Wow. This place is a dump.

25:04.111 --> 25:06.374
Congrats on getting
your own apartment, Magnum.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.115
Now why am I here?

25:08.158 --> 25:10.291
Well, see for yourself.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.902
You got Skip? When?

25:12.946 --> 25:14.208
How?!Look,

25:14.251 --> 25:15.557
that's not important.
What is important is,

25:15.601 --> 25:17.864
I don't think he's the killer.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.561
Is that what he told you?

25:19.605 --> 25:22.869
Magnum, every skip trace says
they're innocent.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.784
I can't believe you fell for
the oldest trick in the book.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.829
Yeah, but the last thing Barry
did was went across the street

25:26.873 --> 25:28.048
and checked out that warehouse.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.571
I think that's
what got him killed.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.878
I'm telling you, something
shady's going on in there.

25:31.921 --> 25:34.750
Okay, his lips are moving,
but all I see are dollar signs

25:34.794 --> 25:35.969
coming out
of his mouth.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.666
Does he know
how much money he's worth?

25:37.710 --> 25:39.755
This isn't about money.Then what is it about?

25:39.799 --> 25:41.496
Why am I here?I just don't know

25:41.540 --> 25:43.803
what's going on, okay?
That's why I texted you,

25:43.846 --> 25:45.805
because I needed somebody
I can trust to watch Skip

25:45.848 --> 25:47.850
while I go across the street
and check the warehouse out.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.939
Or you texted me
because I live closer

25:49.983 --> 25:51.854
to this dump than Rick or TC.

25:51.898 --> 25:53.421
Yeah, yeah, that, too.

25:53.464 --> 25:56.555
Magnum, seriously,
you are running out of time.

25:56.598 --> 25:59.993
If you want the cash,
you need to turn Skip in now.

26:00.036 --> 26:02.343
Well, you're right about me
running out of time.

26:02.386 --> 26:03.562
[sighs]

26:03.605 --> 26:04.911
How about this?

26:04.954 --> 26:07.435
If you give me time
to catch the real killer,

26:07.478 --> 26:09.219
you can keep the reward money.

26:09.263 --> 26:10.307
Wha...?

26:11.570 --> 26:13.006
All of it?

26:13.049 --> 26:14.181
All the money.

26:14.224 --> 26:15.617
Okay, what's the catch?

26:15.661 --> 26:17.576
Uh, I have my reasons, okay?

26:17.619 --> 26:20.013
All you got to worry about is
sitting back, relaxing

26:20.056 --> 26:22.232
and watching
some free cable.

26:22.276 --> 26:25.148
This is gonna be the easiest
money you will ever make.

26:25.192 --> 26:28.151
Come on, what
do you say? Deal?

26:29.675 --> 26:32.460
I'm suspicious,
but I'm not an idiot.

26:32.503 --> 26:33.940
Of course I'll take the deal.

26:33.983 --> 26:35.158
Of course you're
gonna take the deal.

26:35.202 --> 26:36.377
I'll see you
in a little bit.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.596
[door opens, closes]

26:37.639 --> 26:39.119
LUTHER:
So, Skippy, my man,

26:39.162 --> 26:40.686
you play War?

26:40.729 --> 26:42.775
Can you untie me?

26:42.818 --> 26:44.037
No.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.255
But don't sweat it.

26:45.299 --> 26:46.735
I'll deal.[playing cards shuffling]

26:51.261 --> 26:52.741
MAGNUM:
I know it doesn't seem fair

26:52.785 --> 26:55.265
to give Luther the reward
for babysitting Skip,

26:55.309 --> 26:58.268
but being a private
investigator isn't about

26:58.312 --> 27:01.010
getting what's fair. It's about getting the job done.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.059
And opening

27:06.102 --> 27:08.931
and closing doors
as quietly as you can.

27:08.975 --> 27:11.542
[door creaking]

27:38.221 --> 27:40.659
Now, I've seen contraband

27:40.702 --> 27:42.704
smuggled around in everything

27:42.748 --> 27:44.488
from coffee grinds
to dead fish.

27:44.532 --> 27:47.622
And if Skip's right, and
Barry was murdered over this,

27:47.666 --> 27:49.363
my guess is
it was for something

27:49.406 --> 27:51.713
other than pro surfing
reject shirts.

27:54.237 --> 27:56.936
Something like
a crate full of drugs.

28:09.557 --> 28:10.645
[door opens]
