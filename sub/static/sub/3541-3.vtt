<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.920 --> 00:06.388
For over a century
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.556 --> 00:08.456
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:08.692 --> 00:11.058
- What are you?
- I'm a vampire.

00:11.261 --> 00:14.230
Tell me about your ex, Katherine?
She broke your heart.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.625
That was a long time ago.

00:15.832 --> 00:16.958
Why do I look like her?

00:18.868 --> 00:22.099
- What's your problem?
- I don't know, okay?

00:22.272 --> 00:24.467
- So the black sheep returns.
- Tyler?

00:24.641 --> 00:27.109
- Who's the guy with Caroline?
- Mason Lockwood.

00:27.310 --> 00:28.641
The Lockwoods have a secret.

00:28.812 --> 00:31.303
They're not vampires.
They're something else.

00:31.481 --> 00:34.245
I love Stefan.
It's always gonna be Stefan.

00:34.718 --> 00:35.946
No, Damon. Stop it, ahh!

00:37.287 --> 00:39.778
It's Katherine.
She undid everything good about him.

00:39.989 --> 00:41.115
I hate him, Stefan.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.924
I fed her blood.
Katherine obviously killed her.

00:46.096 --> 00:48.997
- And A plus B equals...
- Because I'm starving.

00:51.367 --> 00:53.164
Thanks for coming, Ric.

00:53.336 --> 00:56.863
Can I get you something to drink?
Coffee, bourbon, bourbon in your coffee?

00:57.040 --> 01:00.339
- Elena mentioned you needed my help.
- Yeah.

01:00.510 --> 01:04.879
We were, uh, hoping you could help shed
some light on the Lockwood family.

01:13.189 --> 01:15.282
<i>Why would I know anything</i>
<i>about the Lockwoods?</i>

01:15.458 --> 01:17.289
Well, you wouldn't.

01:17.460 --> 01:20.190
But your dead...
Not-dead vampire wife might.

01:21.564 --> 01:24.397
Isobel's research from when you guys
were at Duke together.

01:24.567 --> 01:27.229
You said that she had spent years
researching this town.

01:27.403 --> 01:33.535
Isobel's research here in Mystic Falls
was rooted in folklore and legend.

01:33.777 --> 01:36.712
At the time,
I thought most of which was fiction.

01:36.913 --> 01:38.471
Like that amazing vampire story.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.879
- Aside from vampires, what else?
- The lycanthrope.

01:45.421 --> 01:48.413
Wait, like werewolves?

01:48.658 --> 01:50.023
No way. Impossible.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.821
- Way too Lon Chaney.
- Is it?

01:53.863 --> 01:57.890
I've been on this planet 160 some
odd years, never come across one.

01:58.067 --> 02:00.729
If werewolves exist,
where the hell are they?

02:15.618 --> 02:16.949
<i>Why suspect the Lockwoods?</i>

02:17.120 --> 02:20.920
Vervain didn't affect the mayor
on Founders Day, the Gilbert device did.

02:21.090 --> 02:22.785
And it affected his son Tyler.

02:22.959 --> 02:25.689
<i>And at the school carnival,</i>
<i>his Uncle Mason exhibited...</i>

02:25.895 --> 02:29.422
<i>...inhuman behavior when he fought</i>
<i>one of the carnival workers.</i>

02:33.403 --> 02:36.964
It suggested some sort
of a supernatural entity.

02:37.140 --> 02:40.906
We were hoping that Isobel's research
could help us figure out what it is.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.136
Well, all of her things are still at Duke.
Ahem.

02:43.346 --> 02:46.804
I mean, her office is still there.
She's technically still missing.

02:46.983 --> 02:49.383
So can we get access to it?

03:08.905 --> 03:12.773
Ric, we need to know
what we're dealing with.

03:12.942 --> 03:16.139
If this wolfman thing is true, I've seen
enough movies to know it's not good.

03:24.087 --> 03:27.147
It means Mason Lockwood
is a real-life Lon Chaney.

03:27.323 --> 03:31.089
And that little Tyler punk
may just very well be Lon Chaney Jr.

03:31.261 --> 03:35.925
Which means Bela Lugosi, meaning me,
is totally screwed.

03:52.682 --> 03:54.707
Caroline?

04:02.191 --> 04:03.453
Caroline?

04:15.238 --> 04:17.798
<i>It's Caroline. Leave a message.</i>

04:17.974 --> 04:19.964
Hey, uh, I thought you said
you were at home.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.235
Tyler's doing a thing
at the swimming hole.

04:22.445 --> 04:24.242
I wanted us to spend the day together.

04:24.447 --> 04:26.972
Where are you? Call me.

04:31.587 --> 04:34.852
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Which part?

04:35.024 --> 04:37.185
Digging through
my birth mother's lifework...

04:37.360 --> 04:39.419
...or going to Duke with Damon?

04:39.595 --> 04:42.689
Heh, either. Both.

04:42.865 --> 04:47.700
Well, I'm sure about the first part.
But then again, Ric is a good buffer.

04:47.870 --> 04:52.773
So we can bond
in our anti-Damon solidarity.

04:54.610 --> 04:56.202
I wish you were coming, though.

04:56.412 --> 04:59.404
You know what, maybe we should wait
a couple of days, huh?

05:00.049 --> 05:03.212
Wait till, uh, Caroline's less of a danger,
and then I can go with you.

05:03.419 --> 05:07.253
It's okay that I'm going, right?
Be honest, if it's not, I can stay here.

05:07.423 --> 05:09.948
- We can take care of Caroline.
- No, I want you to go.

05:10.126 --> 05:11.184
Okay? I do.

05:11.361 --> 05:14.728
You have questions about your lineage
and about Katherine and...

05:14.931 --> 05:17.422
I'm not gonna let the fact
that Damon is going...

05:17.600 --> 05:20.091
...keep you from an opportunity
to get some answers.

05:21.904 --> 05:23.462
- You hate it, though.
- I hate it.

05:24.841 --> 05:28.208
- But I love you.
- I love you too.

05:30.546 --> 05:31.740
<i>It's been a while.</i>

05:31.914 --> 05:36.010
Heh, well, school's been keeping me,
you know, busy.

05:37.387 --> 05:39.378
I want you to know
it means a lot to me...

05:39.555 --> 05:42.285
...that Elena has a connection
to her mother.

05:42.458 --> 05:44.221
I appreciate you bringing her along.

05:44.394 --> 05:48.888
Yeah. Well, I figured it was time to take
care of my wife's things, you know?

05:52.035 --> 05:55.835
Look, Jenna, I know, uh, things between
you and I have been a little start-and-stop.

05:56.039 --> 05:57.939
And I'm sorry for that.

05:58.107 --> 06:01.167
- But maybe once I can...
- Uh, no, don't do that.

06:01.344 --> 06:05.872
Not the "half, maybe apology,
hope for the future" thing.

06:07.316 --> 06:09.682
Elena, are you coming?

06:14.190 --> 06:15.817
Do what you need to do, okay?

06:25.068 --> 06:27.002
- Hey, you okay?
- Heh, yeah.

06:27.170 --> 06:29.502
Just men and their baggage, heh.

06:31.874 --> 06:34.502
Sorry you can't come too, Stef.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.615
- Call me if you need anything.
- I'll take good care of her.

06:50.093 --> 06:52.391
Okay, time to go.

06:59.102 --> 07:00.626
Bye.

07:03.873 --> 07:06.899
Have you ever been down
to those old ruins in the woods?

07:07.110 --> 07:09.044
- The old Lockwood estate?
- Yeah.

07:09.245 --> 07:10.507
What do you know about it?

07:10.680 --> 07:14.207
It was the original plantation house.
Beautiful antebellum architecture.

07:14.383 --> 07:17.045
And if it hadn't burnt to the ground,
we'd probably be living in it.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.244
Hmm.

07:19.155 --> 07:22.147
What's the deal
with the freaky underground cellar?

07:24.026 --> 07:25.891
We don't talk about
those kind of rooms.

07:26.129 --> 07:28.563
- Why not?
- Well, this is the South, honey.

07:28.731 --> 07:31.825
But no one likes to reminisce about
the old slave days.

07:32.001 --> 07:35.334
Hey. What are you guys talking about?

07:35.505 --> 07:38.201
We were just talking about
the old Lockwood property.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.899
Thinking of having friends over.

07:41.077 --> 07:44.877
Be careful. If anything happens
on the property, the family is liable.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.947
Of course.

07:52.355 --> 07:55.290
I don't know how to make
a day-walking ring.

07:55.458 --> 07:58.916
Emily made mine, made Damon's too.
Instructions must be in the Grimoire.

07:59.162 --> 08:02.529
- That doesn't mean I can cast a spell.
- Bonnie, ahem.

08:03.266 --> 08:06.702
You know how to drop vampires
with a single look.

08:06.869 --> 08:09.861
Okay? I think you can figure it out.

08:10.039 --> 08:12.599
Caroline killed someone, Stefan.

08:12.775 --> 08:14.743
I can't make it easier for her to do it.

08:14.911 --> 08:18.574
We're not making it easier for her.
We're giving her the chance to survive.

08:18.781 --> 08:22.547
Every day she's cut off from her old life,
from you, from Elena, from Matt...

08:22.718 --> 08:25.551
...it'll make it harder for her
to hold on to her humanity.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.053
- You know she won't hurt anyone else?
- I don't.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.692
But if we don't do
everything we can...

08:30.893 --> 08:34.192
...or at least trust the fact
that she can keep it together...

08:35.998 --> 08:38.261
...we might as well
just stake her right now.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.701
I don't know if I can trust her.
Not with this.

08:42.337 --> 08:43.895
Then trust me.

08:48.578 --> 08:50.512
How are you doing back there?

08:50.746 --> 08:54.238
You know, this whole pretending
to hate me thing is getting a little silly.

08:54.417 --> 08:57.682
Heh, I don't think she's pretending.
You did kill her brother.

08:57.853 --> 09:00.583
There is a huge asterisk
next to that statement.

09:00.756 --> 09:01.780
He came back to life.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.449
Thanks to a ring
you didn't know he was wearing.

09:04.660 --> 09:06.719
- Why are you sure I didn't know?
- Did you?

09:07.296 --> 09:08.490
Yes.

09:09.632 --> 09:13.295
- You're lying.
- Elena, I saw the ring.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.996
It's a big, tacky thing.
It's hard to miss.

09:22.111 --> 09:25.706
So I don't get to choose the ring
I have to wear the rest of my life?

09:25.881 --> 09:28.475
- Hey, if you don't want it...
- No, she...

09:28.651 --> 09:30.346
She wants it.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.646
- Now what?
- The part where I explain the rules.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.657
The witch who spells the ring
has the power to de-spell it.

09:37.827 --> 09:41.627
- So if you do anything to hurt anyone...
- I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

09:41.797 --> 09:43.355
You're a vampire.

09:43.566 --> 09:46.296
That means the urge to kill
is a part of who you are.

09:46.502 --> 09:49.369
The minute you let it take over,
I will stop you.

09:50.906 --> 09:55.309
- You're supposed to be my friend.
- I can't ignore what happened, okay?

09:55.511 --> 09:59.379
You're gonna have to prove
that the Caroline I remember isn't gone.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.340
Now put the ring on the bed.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.192
Do you really think I meant
to kill that guy at the carnival?

10:13.362 --> 10:17.162
He's still dead. Now, do you want me
to cast the spell or not?

10:43.359 --> 10:45.122
All done.

10:49.965 --> 10:51.125
Hmm...

10:52.101 --> 10:53.762
So that's it?

10:53.936 --> 10:57.133
I mean, nothing witchy happened, heh.

10:57.340 --> 11:01.208
You know, no flickering lights,
no gusts of wind.

11:01.377 --> 11:03.436
- Have you even done this before?
- Caroline.

11:03.646 --> 11:06.171
Well, I just wanna make sure it worked.

11:08.718 --> 11:10.276
It worked.

11:12.555 --> 11:14.546
What if it hadn't, Bonnie?

11:14.724 --> 11:15.782
She's all yours.

11:28.804 --> 11:32.399
So Isobel was officially employed
by the Anthropology Department...

11:32.575 --> 11:36.739
...given that most paranormal phenomena
is rooted in folklore.

11:37.580 --> 11:40.606
Excuse me. Hi, I'm Alaric Saltzman.

11:40.816 --> 11:43.216
- I called earlier.
- Yes.

11:43.386 --> 11:46.617
Uh, of course. I'm Vanessa Monroe,
research assistant.

11:46.822 --> 11:48.153
Comparative folklore.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.353
Oh, let me grab Isobel's keys.

11:50.526 --> 11:53.984
Sorry, my friends Elena and Damon.
I hope this isn't an imposition.

11:54.196 --> 11:56.994
Oh, please,
Isobel's office is right through there.

11:57.166 --> 12:00.567
Isobel was one of my first professors.
I'm a grad student.

12:00.736 --> 12:02.829
She was brilliant.

12:03.005 --> 12:05.803
And one of the reasons
I went into folklore.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.805
I have to ask, um...

12:10.679 --> 12:13.512
...has there been any news?
- No, no, I'm afraid not.

12:14.550 --> 12:16.040
It's right this way.

12:28.130 --> 12:30.564
I'll grab the light.
Feel free to look around.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.961
It's fascinating, isn't it?

12:34.603 --> 12:35.831
Mm-hm.

12:43.579 --> 12:45.342
Where did she go?

12:58.360 --> 12:59.884
Hurry.

13:07.236 --> 13:08.362
Pull it out.

13:09.004 --> 13:11.063
I can't reach it, Elena.

13:11.240 --> 13:15.267
Just pull the damn thing out. It hurts.

13:24.086 --> 13:26.884
- That bitch is dead.
- Uh, you're not gonna kill her.

13:28.090 --> 13:29.785
Watch me.

13:29.959 --> 13:33.827
You touch her and I swear
I will never speak to you again.

13:33.996 --> 13:36.931
What makes you think
that has any power over me?

13:37.099 --> 13:40.034
Because I took an arrow in the back
for you?

13:40.202 --> 13:43.000
You are severely overestimating yourself.

13:43.205 --> 13:46.197
Right, I forgot that I was speaking
to a psychotic mind...

13:46.408 --> 13:48.968
...who snaps
and kills people impulsively.

13:49.144 --> 13:52.841
- Fine, go ahead, do whatever you want.
- You're trying to manipulate me.

13:53.015 --> 13:57.918
If by manipulate you mean
tell the truth, okay, guilty.

14:01.123 --> 14:02.715
Okay.

14:05.060 --> 14:06.186
Please.

14:06.362 --> 14:08.990
Okay, I freaked.
You would have done the same thing.

14:09.198 --> 14:11.996
It is not possible.
Katherine Pierce can't be alive.

14:12.201 --> 14:15.534
And Damon Salvatore died in 1864.

14:16.138 --> 14:18.163
Okay, I read Isobel's research.

14:18.340 --> 14:21.241
Well, then you should know
just how possible this is.

14:29.718 --> 14:31.845
I'm Elena Gilbert.

14:32.021 --> 14:35.320
Isobel's daughter
and a descendent of Katherine Pierce.

14:37.993 --> 14:40.325
And this is Damon Salvatore,
who you just shot.

14:40.496 --> 14:42.828
I'd be extra nice to me right now.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.262
Look, we need your help, okay?

14:45.501 --> 14:49.232
We need to see all of Isobel's research.
Anything related to Mystic Falls.

14:52.575 --> 14:54.475
So, what do I do when I see the rabbit?

14:54.643 --> 14:57.237
Chase it, catch it, feed on it.

14:57.413 --> 15:01.406
Isn't killing cute, defenseless animals
the first step in becoming a serial killer?

15:01.617 --> 15:04.780
You sort of skipped serial killer
and went straight to vampire.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.478
If you're not serious about this,
you should tell me.

15:07.690 --> 15:09.180
No, I am.

15:09.758 --> 15:13.125
Look, I swear that I am, okay?
But it's just...

15:13.629 --> 15:16.063
I haven't been in the sun for days.

15:16.231 --> 15:18.699
Everyone's at the swimming hole,
and Matt is there.

15:18.901 --> 15:21.893
He finally told me he loved me,
but I've been blowing him off.

15:22.071 --> 15:26.303
And now you want me to eat bunnies,
and I'm kind of freaking out, okay?

15:29.411 --> 15:31.777
- Now you're laughing at me.
- No, I'm not laughing.

15:31.947 --> 15:34.245
None of this is funny, trust me. It's, heh...

15:34.717 --> 15:36.207
It's just that, uh...

15:38.253 --> 15:40.721
- What?
- When someone becomes a vampire...

15:40.889 --> 15:45.326
...all of their natural behaviors
get sort of, uh, uh, amplified.

15:45.761 --> 15:46.819
What do you mean?

15:47.062 --> 15:52.056
I mean, uh, as a human, I cared deeply
for people and how they felt.

15:52.234 --> 15:56.068
Uh, if they were hurting, I felt their pain.
And I felt guilty if I caused it.

15:56.238 --> 16:00.732
And, uh, as a vampire, all of that got...

16:01.677 --> 16:02.769
...magnified.

16:05.848 --> 16:09.648
So you're saying,
that now I'm basically...

16:09.818 --> 16:13.151
...an insecure, neurotic,
control freak on crack.

16:13.989 --> 16:18.551
Well, I wasn't gonna say it
like that, but...

16:19.428 --> 16:21.953
- Hey, listen. Let's hunt, okay?
- Ugh.

16:22.131 --> 16:23.655
And then after that...

16:23.832 --> 16:26.096
...we'll go to the swimming hole.
- Really?

16:26.301 --> 16:28.599
Matt is the closest connection
to your humanity.

16:28.771 --> 16:31.262
And I think that being around him
is a good thing.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.172
- Okay.
- Come on.

16:34.343 --> 16:37.369
Okay. Bunnies.

16:37.613 --> 16:41.140
This box tracks Katherine's arrival...

16:41.316 --> 16:45.514
...to Mystic Falls in April of 1864.

16:46.221 --> 16:49.679
- Is that all there is about her?
- All that I'm aware of.

16:53.395 --> 16:55.022
Here.

16:56.365 --> 16:57.389
Take this.

16:58.667 --> 17:02.194
- Does vervain really work?
- Nope, not at all.

17:04.239 --> 17:05.797
Can he hear us?

17:05.973 --> 17:08.374
No, that would be creepy.

17:08.977 --> 17:10.535
Can he read minds too?

17:10.713 --> 17:14.809
You know, if you wanna
see me naked, all you have to do is ask.

17:15.384 --> 17:18.147
No. That, he can't do.

17:19.253 --> 17:22.712
He is very capable
of being a first-rate jackass.

17:36.205 --> 17:38.673
Is it me,
or did Aimee Bradley's ass get hot?

17:38.841 --> 17:40.706
All class, all class.

17:40.876 --> 17:43.504
- Where's Forbes?
- I wish I knew.

17:43.712 --> 17:46.374
- You guys on the outs already?
- No, we're fine.

17:46.548 --> 17:49.540
I'm fine. I'm just not sure where she is.

17:51.453 --> 17:52.886
What's your uncle doing here?

17:57.426 --> 17:59.553
You busting us, or are you joining us?

17:59.728 --> 18:02.754
Neither. You make sure
everyone's out of here by dark.

18:02.965 --> 18:06.025
- What happens after dark?
- Someone ends up wasted and dead.

18:07.402 --> 18:09.199
You heard your mom.
The family's liable.

18:09.404 --> 18:10.769
Don't be a party-killer.

18:10.973 --> 18:13.806
I didn't say to stop partying.
I said to take it elsewhere.

18:15.377 --> 18:18.312
All right. We'll be out of here.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.593
Why are you looking at him
with your serious vampire look?

18:35.230 --> 18:37.357
My what? My serious vampire look?

18:37.533 --> 18:40.093
Mm-hm. It's different
from your worried vampire look.

18:40.502 --> 18:43.494
Neither stray too far
from your "Hey, it's Tuesday" look.

18:44.473 --> 18:45.667
Oh, I get it.

18:45.841 --> 18:48.071
Okay, you think I'm, uh...

18:48.243 --> 18:50.234
You think I'm too serious, that it?

18:50.412 --> 18:52.277
I mean,
I wasn't gonna say it like that, but...

18:52.447 --> 18:53.471
Hmm.

18:54.917 --> 18:58.148
- Hey, Aimee.
- Thanks.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.912
You're missing all the fun.

19:00.122 --> 19:02.784
- Ugh, not waterproof.
- Too bad.

19:02.991 --> 19:05.357
So, uh, there's a full moon tonight.

19:05.527 --> 19:07.995
We gonna light a fire later
and tell ghost stories?

19:08.230 --> 19:10.164
- I don't know. Heh-heh-heh.
- Matt.

19:10.999 --> 19:12.364
I've been calling you.

19:12.601 --> 19:15.661
I know, I got held up.
But I'm here now.

19:16.338 --> 19:17.532
Hey, Caroline.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.465
Go find somebody single to stalk, Aimee.

19:25.848 --> 19:28.442
- Seriously?
- Heh, she was flirting with you.

19:28.650 --> 19:30.845
She's harmless.
You don't have to be rude.

19:31.019 --> 19:34.147
- You're mad?
- You've been dodging my calls all day.

19:34.323 --> 19:37.884
And you get to show up here
and be the jealous girlfriend?

19:38.060 --> 19:39.891
It's kind of lame, Care.

19:42.397 --> 19:45.525
- Hey, I saw that, you compelled her.
- Yeah, she deserved it.

19:45.701 --> 19:49.694
Caroline, nobody deserves to have their
mind messed with for shallow reasons.

19:49.905 --> 19:52.738
You know, why is everyone sticking up
for Aimee freaking Bradley?

19:54.276 --> 19:56.176
You're letting your jealousy
get the best of you.

19:56.345 --> 20:01.009
Oh, so now I have magnified
jealousy issues too. That's great.

20:01.183 --> 20:03.310
I told you this wasn't gonna be easy.

20:03.485 --> 20:06.249
Yeah, well,
might as well have stayed dead.

20:06.421 --> 20:09.584
My entire personality is killing me.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.193
Shut up.

20:20.002 --> 20:21.230
Any luck?

20:21.403 --> 20:24.702
There's nothing in here about Katherine
that we don't already know.

20:24.873 --> 20:28.400
Oh, man. You know, it's a bummer
we're not friends anymore.

20:28.577 --> 20:30.010
I could tell you what I know.

20:31.847 --> 20:34.111
Now who's manipulating who?

20:34.850 --> 20:38.115
Hey, guys, check this out.

20:41.089 --> 20:43.751
There's no record
of werewolf mythology in Mystic Falls.

20:43.926 --> 20:47.623
But here are some records
of some of the lesser known legends.

20:47.829 --> 20:52.232
Everything from, uh, Scandinavian
skin-walkers to the Maréchal de Retz.

20:55.137 --> 20:58.402
Which roughly translates into
"the curse of the sun and moon."

20:59.107 --> 21:01.234
- It's Native American.
- Aztec.

21:01.410 --> 21:04.902
It explains one origin of the werewolf
curse traced through Virginia.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.414
<i>600 years ago...</i>

21:07.582 --> 21:10.779
<i>...the Aztecs were plagued</i>
<i>by werewolves and vampires.</i>

21:10.953 --> 21:15.083
<i>They terrorized the countryside,</i>
<i>made farming and hunting impossible.</i>

21:15.257 --> 21:18.158
Until an Aztec shaman cursed them.

21:18.760 --> 21:22.753
Making vampires slaves to the sun
and werewolves servants of the moon.

21:22.965 --> 21:25.559
As a result,
vampires could only prowl at night...

21:25.734 --> 21:28.134
...and werewolves
could only turn on a full moon.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.498
<i>When the full moon crests in the sky,</i>
<i>who's ever unlucky enough...</i>

21:31.673 --> 21:34.642
<i>...to fall under the werewolf curse</i>
<i>turns into a wolf.</i>

21:36.812 --> 21:38.575
Can they control the transformation?

21:39.781 --> 21:43.410
If it were a choice,
it wouldn't be called a curse.

21:47.289 --> 21:51.123
<i>Werewolves will attack humans.</i>
<i>But instinct and centuries of rivalry...</i>

21:51.326 --> 21:54.090
<i>...have hardwired them</i>
<i>to hunt their prey of choice:</i>

21:54.830 --> 21:56.263
Vampires.

22:01.303 --> 22:05.501
Well, if werewolves are hunting vampires,
I would know about it.

22:05.674 --> 22:08.268
Not if there aren't
that many werewolves left alive.

22:09.111 --> 22:12.103
Hundreds of years ago,
vampires hunted them almost to extinction.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.214
- Why do that?
- To protect themselves.

22:14.449 --> 22:17.941
Legend has it that a werewolf bite
is fatal to vampires.

22:22.224 --> 22:23.248
Oh.

22:35.619 --> 22:37.917
We gotta get out of here.

22:38.622 --> 22:41.113
Come on, guys.
Tyler wants us out of here.

22:41.324 --> 22:43.121
We gotta move the party.

22:43.326 --> 22:45.226
He's mad at me.

22:48.865 --> 22:49.957
Go talk to him.

22:52.202 --> 22:53.567
I'll wait.

22:57.974 --> 22:59.635
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:59.843 --> 23:01.276
We've learned some stuff here.

23:01.444 --> 23:04.572
And I know it's gonna sound crazy,
but I wanted to fill you in.

23:05.081 --> 23:06.605
What's up?

23:13.557 --> 23:14.990
Still mad?

23:15.158 --> 23:18.616
I thought we were past
all this insecurity stuff, Caroline.

23:18.795 --> 23:21.161
I told you how I felt.
What more do you need?

23:21.398 --> 23:23.958
Nothing, nothing. L...

23:24.167 --> 23:26.965
I don't need anything else.

23:27.170 --> 23:29.001
I'm sorry, Matt. I'm so sorry.

23:29.172 --> 23:32.232
I'm so, so, so sorry.

23:32.442 --> 23:33.466
I'm not kidding.

23:33.643 --> 23:36.612
- I'm not gonna put up with the drama.
- No, no more drama.

23:36.780 --> 23:38.975
Just... I promise. Just...

23:40.784 --> 23:42.649
Just this.

23:47.457 --> 23:49.015
Come on.

23:49.192 --> 23:52.457
I don't know what it means,
or if we should even believe it, but...

23:52.629 --> 23:54.028
...it's a full moon, Stefan.

23:54.264 --> 23:57.131
- After what you saw Mason Lockwood do...
- I'll be careful.

23:57.300 --> 23:59.461
- <i>There's one more thing.</i>
- What is it?

23:59.669 --> 24:03.696
According to the legend,
a werewolf bite can kill a vampire.

24:11.781 --> 24:13.510
Listen, um, I gotta go.

24:13.717 --> 24:16.049
<i>- I'II, uh, see you when you get home, okay?</i>
- Okay.

25:08.471 --> 25:09.995
- What is this place?
- Relax.

25:10.173 --> 25:12.232
Wait, what is this place?

25:12.409 --> 25:15.037
It's a, you know...

25:15.745 --> 25:16.837
Not much farther, Aimee.

25:17.013 --> 25:19.675
Ha, ha, really, Tyler?
You drag me all the way out here?

25:19.849 --> 25:22.283
I had to move the party.
So I'm moving the party.

25:22.485 --> 25:26.012
- Where are we going?
- It's right around this tree.

25:27.023 --> 25:29.787
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah, come on.

25:33.430 --> 25:36.456
- What is this place?
- It's a ruin.

25:36.633 --> 25:38.863
Buried underneath
my family's old estate.

25:39.035 --> 25:42.801
- No one will know we're down here.
- Is everyone else coming?

25:43.006 --> 25:44.268
Yeah.

25:44.441 --> 25:46.568
Unless you rather I tell them not to.

25:47.711 --> 25:49.804
- You're single, right?
- Oh, yeah.

25:51.314 --> 25:52.941
Let's go.

27:04.154 --> 27:07.954
Hey, um, have you done any research
on doppelgangers?

27:08.158 --> 27:13.061
Well, the word means a lot
of different things to different cultures.

27:13.229 --> 27:18.166
But typically a doppelganger
is a living, breathing double of oneself.

27:18.334 --> 27:22.668
Did Isobel have anything that'd explain
the link between me and Katherine?

27:22.839 --> 27:25.672
That's all she had on Katherine,
unfortunately.

27:30.647 --> 27:34.174
But I can tell you...

27:34.350 --> 27:38.480
...that doppelgangers usually torment
the people they look like...

27:38.655 --> 27:41.749
...trying to undo their lives.

27:41.958 --> 27:44.017
It's not exactly uplifting.

27:44.194 --> 27:46.389
And more things we already know.

27:47.997 --> 27:51.228
Just... I wanna know why we look alike.

27:52.669 --> 27:55.160
- Head-scratcher, isn't it?
- Do you know something?

27:55.338 --> 27:57.203
Or are you just being yourself?

27:57.373 --> 28:00.831
Well, if I know anything,
I'm not gonna tell you.

28:01.010 --> 28:02.375
Not with that attitude.

28:03.413 --> 28:07.349
That's good. And this is coming from
someone who wants to be my friend.

28:08.017 --> 28:09.780
But you know what?

28:10.019 --> 28:14.922
Friends don't manipulate friends.
They help each other.

28:23.032 --> 28:25.296
Wait, wait. No, I'm sorry.

28:25.935 --> 28:27.266
What's the deal? Come on.

28:29.372 --> 28:31.135
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, I can't.

28:31.307 --> 28:33.502
I'm... I'm not into it.

28:33.710 --> 28:36.076
- Then why'd you come with me?
- I don't know.

28:36.246 --> 28:39.238
I'm not even really sure why
I was flirting with you. L...

28:39.415 --> 28:41.144
I like Matt.

28:41.317 --> 28:42.375
Ouch!

28:43.853 --> 28:45.115
Um...

28:45.655 --> 28:48.283
- Okay, uh...
- I'm gonna go.

28:48.458 --> 28:49.584
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

28:51.060 --> 28:52.186
Wow.

28:53.363 --> 28:54.660
Um...

30:14.777 --> 30:15.903
Thanks.

30:16.079 --> 30:19.378
I trust you, uh, not to
say anything about this to anyone.

30:19.582 --> 30:22.244
Or else Damon will kill me in my sleep?

30:22.418 --> 30:24.716
He gave me the 411.

30:25.421 --> 30:28.515
But if you need anything, you'll call?

30:29.092 --> 30:31.060
Hopefully I won't have to.

30:31.227 --> 30:33.525
But if you do...

30:35.765 --> 30:39.292
Listen, you don't wanna get
caught up in this. Really.

30:39.469 --> 30:40.800
It'll take over.

30:40.970 --> 30:44.201
And it'll keep you
from being able to live your life.

30:44.374 --> 30:47.036
Isobel's disappearance...

30:47.877 --> 30:49.538
...was it related to her research?

30:49.946 --> 30:53.905
Isobel became her research.

30:54.083 --> 30:57.280
Uh, she wanted to become a vampire.

30:58.488 --> 30:59.580
She got her wish.

31:01.391 --> 31:05.088
I guess that would put a strain
on a marriage.

31:05.261 --> 31:06.319
Uh...

31:07.897 --> 31:12.095
Anyway, I was wondering what it would,
uh, be like to come back here. It's, uh...

31:12.935 --> 31:15.597
It's okay. It's really okay.

31:16.239 --> 31:20.801
It feels good to have her in my past.

31:20.977 --> 31:24.708
You know,
it's time to move beyond this.

31:24.881 --> 31:25.939
Hmm.

31:32.121 --> 31:33.611
Here.

31:35.224 --> 31:36.851
Allow me.

31:39.996 --> 31:42.260
You're not gonna be able
to hate me forever.

31:42.432 --> 31:43.592
Can we just go?

31:46.436 --> 31:47.801
You didn't dig deep enough.

31:49.539 --> 31:50.733
"Petrova"?

31:51.607 --> 31:55.202
- I saw this on the shelf.
- Katherine originally came from Europe.

31:55.378 --> 31:59.940
Petrova was her real name.
Katerina Petrova to be exact.

32:01.484 --> 32:02.610
How did you know that?

32:02.819 --> 32:06.880
Back when,
I saw it engraved on an old heirloom.

32:07.356 --> 32:09.790
Men snoop too, you know.

32:10.159 --> 32:12.627
Let me know what you find.
Very curious myself.

32:15.765 --> 32:17.858
You have every right to hate me.

32:18.701 --> 32:20.464
I understand.

32:21.838 --> 32:23.829
You hated me before
and we became friends.

32:26.976 --> 32:30.537
It would suck
if that was gone forever.

32:32.215 --> 32:35.707
So is it?

32:35.918 --> 32:38.352
Have I lost you forever?

32:40.423 --> 32:42.721
Thank you for the book, Damon.

32:54.704 --> 32:56.899
This looks like the spot.

32:57.707 --> 32:58.731
For what?

33:05.448 --> 33:06.847
Did you hear that?

33:21.464 --> 33:22.897
Argh, damn.

33:23.766 --> 33:27.065
- What happened?
- I'm a klutz.

33:28.104 --> 33:29.935
What's the matter?

33:31.707 --> 33:33.641
What...? What are you doing?

33:34.544 --> 33:36.341
Caroline?

33:42.251 --> 33:45.345
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline.

33:47.123 --> 33:48.613
What the hell? Your face.

33:55.565 --> 33:58.261
Stop it. Hey, stop, stop, stop.

34:00.069 --> 34:01.434
Stop.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.870
- Oh, my God.
- No, no. No, stop. Listen to me.

34:07.243 --> 34:08.870
We need to get out
of these woods. Now.

34:09.078 --> 34:10.909
- We need to leave.
- What was that?

34:12.648 --> 34:15.446
Matt, stay down. Do not move.

34:21.424 --> 34:23.755
You and me, we're gonna run, okay?

34:23.926 --> 34:26.360
It's gonna follow us,
we'll lead it away from Matt.

34:26.529 --> 34:29.657
So you need to run as fast as you can.
Do you understand me?

34:29.899 --> 34:31.389
Go, go.

34:36.272 --> 34:38.672
- Wait, what is it?
- It's a werewolf.

34:38.841 --> 34:41.810
- It will try to kill us, and it can.
- Hey.

34:42.445 --> 34:43.639
What are you two doing?

34:46.782 --> 34:47.806
What are you doing here?

34:50.953 --> 34:52.318
Stefan!

34:58.995 --> 35:00.860
No!

35:18.147 --> 35:20.638
You're not gonna
remember what I did to you.

35:20.816 --> 35:22.443
Or what you saw me become.

35:22.652 --> 35:24.984
We were just making out in the woods.

35:25.955 --> 35:28.651
And then an animal attacked you.

35:28.824 --> 35:31.759
- And bit your neck.
- It's weird, it just came out of nowhere.

35:42.204 --> 35:44.604
What are we gonna do about Tyler?

35:45.308 --> 35:46.935
I took care of it.

35:47.143 --> 35:49.611
I'll get Matt on vervain.

35:49.779 --> 35:51.644
Keep you from being able to compel him.

35:51.814 --> 35:54.612
But it'll also keep you
from being able to drink his blood.

35:57.053 --> 35:59.214
- I can't believe I hurt him.
- I know.

35:59.689 --> 36:05.719
He's the one person on this entire planet
that I never wanted to hurt.

36:05.961 --> 36:07.656
It's not gonna get any easier.

36:09.265 --> 36:12.462
You're just gonna have to work
that much harder.

36:13.202 --> 36:15.864
I shouldn't be with him, should I?

36:16.339 --> 36:17.636
Not if there's any danger.

36:17.807 --> 36:20.241
I'm the last person
to make that decision for you.

36:20.476 --> 36:24.071
If I followed my advice, I would've
walked away from Elena a long time ago.

36:24.246 --> 36:25.577
Do you ever think you should have?

36:27.817 --> 36:29.876
I know I should have.

36:30.553 --> 36:32.521
I just can't.

36:53.209 --> 36:55.177
Wanna toss me those?

37:12.862 --> 37:14.489
It was you.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.740
I can't believe an animal attacked you.

37:27.910 --> 37:30.708
Yeah. There have been a lot
of animal attacks lately.

37:30.880 --> 37:35.078
- Well, are you okay?
- I've been better, heh.

37:35.251 --> 37:37.811
- How are you?
- I'm okay, I'm worried about you.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.716
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

37:45.561 --> 37:48.530
- Seriously, Aimee?
- We were just talking.

37:48.731 --> 37:50.392
- Is that what you call it?
- Yeah, heh.

37:50.599 --> 37:52.624
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not, Matt.

37:52.802 --> 37:54.963
She's into you and anyone can see it.

37:55.137 --> 37:57.901
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
I'm just gonna go.

37:59.408 --> 38:01.342
Knock it off.

38:04.447 --> 38:06.847
- What are you doing?
- This isn't my fault, Matt.

38:07.049 --> 38:09.711
She's after you, and I shouldn't
have to put up with that.

38:09.885 --> 38:12.854
- I thought you said no more drama.
- Well, I lied.

38:14.690 --> 38:16.624
Just forget it.

38:17.326 --> 38:19.260
Just forget all of it.

38:21.330 --> 38:24.163
So, what?
Are you, like, breaking up with me?

38:27.102 --> 38:30.128
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess that's what I'm doing.

38:58.400 --> 39:02.166
Ric, I wasn't expecting
you and Elena till later.

39:14.016 --> 39:16.610
I should've done that this morning.

39:24.293 --> 39:25.419
Road trips work for us.

39:25.628 --> 39:28.654
This doesn't mean things are back
to the way they used to be.

39:28.831 --> 39:31.061
Oh, come on.

39:31.233 --> 39:34.862
You know I chipped a little bit off
of your wall of hatred.

39:35.671 --> 39:37.263
I need to know the truth.

39:38.674 --> 39:40.164
When you broke Jeremy's neck...

39:40.342 --> 39:42.833
...did you know
that he was wearing the ring?

39:46.448 --> 39:49.246
No. No, I didn't.

39:49.418 --> 39:53.912
Katherine really pissed me off,
and I snapped, and...

39:56.692 --> 39:58.626
I got lucky with the ring.

39:58.794 --> 40:01.661
I don't know what I would've done
if he wasn't wearing it.

40:04.767 --> 40:08.567
Elena, I'm sorry.

40:10.472 --> 40:13.100
Thank you for being honest with me.

40:14.476 --> 40:17.809
And the answer to your question
about our friendship...

40:18.814 --> 40:20.714
...is yes.

40:21.784 --> 40:23.615
You have lost me forever.

40:28.924 --> 40:30.755
But you knew that already, didn't you?

40:32.962 --> 40:34.827
You used me today.

40:38.834 --> 40:41.302
You had information
I needed to know.

40:41.470 --> 40:44.200
I thought friends
don't manipulate friends.

40:49.011 --> 40:53.072
You and Katherine have a lot more
in common than just your looks.

41:18.674 --> 41:21.871
- Elena?
- Nope, try again.

41:24.513 --> 41:25.775
Katherine.

41:29.485 --> 41:33.683
Don't be frightened.
We're gonna have so much fun together.
