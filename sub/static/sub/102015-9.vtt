WEBVTT

00:11.762 --> 00:12.763
Mom!

00:14.431 --> 00:15.641
I need your help.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.309
Austin, what's the matter?

00:17.392 --> 00:19.311
Don't tell me.
You've run out of clean socks.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.355
No. No, it's worse than that.

00:21.438 --> 00:25.025
I'm hosting a reunion for
my college friends and Sue's out of town.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.109
Where is she?

00:26.193 --> 00:27.986
She went to visit a friend.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.112
What friend?

00:29.196 --> 00:30.489
I don't know. I don't know.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.573
You know, for the life of me
I can't figure out

00:32.658 --> 00:34.910
how shy, little Sue
ended up making so many friends.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.162
Mom! What am I gonna do?

00:37.246 --> 00:40.541
All the guys are coming over,
and I told them that we would have lunch

00:40.624 --> 00:42.292
or, you know, at least snacks.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.294
Oh, my dear boy. Do not fret.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.629
I'll help you.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.548
Oh, my God. Would you?

00:47.631 --> 00:49.216
Of course.

00:49.299 --> 00:52.219
I've been itching to get into
that new kitchen of yours.

00:52.302 --> 00:55.055
I can't wait to get my hands
on that shiny new pastry jigger.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.099
Oh, yes.

00:57.182 --> 01:00.018
I'll throw you boys
the best tea party you've ever had.

01:00.644 --> 01:01.770
Well, what's this?

01:01.854 --> 01:03.480
Why's the boy over here in his slippers?

01:03.564 --> 01:06.567
Our son is throwing a tea party
for his friends, and I'm going to help.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.735
Well, can't he take care of himself?

01:08.819 --> 01:11.405
-No.
-You're already needed here for tea.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.781
The board meeting, remember?

01:12.865 --> 01:13.866
What board meeting?

01:13.949 --> 01:17.202
Edward, you seem to forget you've married
the best housewife in all of New England.

01:17.286 --> 01:20.747
I can host two tea parties with my eyes
closed and one hand tied behind my back.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.666
Well, there's no need for contortions.

01:22.749 --> 01:23.834
Maybe Emily can help.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.294
Oh, I'm afraid she can't.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.379
She's been locked in her room
since yesterday.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.298
Since her poem got published.

01:29.381 --> 01:30.716
No one's seen her.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.926
I imagine she's dealing
with a lot of shame.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.511
I saw her last night.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.055
You did? Where?

01:38.807 --> 01:42.227
You know, actually,
I didn't, come to think of it.

01:42.311 --> 01:43.312
It was very strange.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.522
She's been doing this
more and more these days.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.150
Hiding like some madwoman in an attic.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.445
It's really quite unsettling.
I do hope it's just a phase.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.633
Dad.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.764
What's this board meeting?

02:19.348 --> 02:23.143
A board meeting of the investors of
The Springfield Republican and affiliates,

02:23.227 --> 02:25.270
of which we are now one.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.941
Wait, you put our money
in that man's paper?

02:29.024 --> 02:31.527
Yes, that's right.
The remainder of the Newman estate.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.612
I've decided to invest it with Mr. Bowles.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.155
-But Dad, he--
-I must admit,

02:35.239 --> 02:38.283
I was a bit skeptical at first,
but he's made a rather compelling case.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.285
The newspaper business can only expand.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.828
Print journalism is the future.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.956
But, Father, I don't understand.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.499
I mean...

02:46.166 --> 02:49.920
how could you give money to
the man who published Emily's poem?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.047
I thought you were
completely opposed to that.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.383
You know, he plans
on publishing even more of them.

02:54.466 --> 02:57.386
Well, I suppose times change, don't they?

02:57.469 --> 02:59.388
And besides,
if I'd made a fuss about that,

02:59.471 --> 03:02.766
it might have made it more complicated
to make the investment.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.269
Oh, okay. So it's all about the money?

03:06.228 --> 03:07.229
I get it.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.898
So much for your principles.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.239
Don't you speak to me like that.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.741
You should've consulted with me
before making this decision.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.159
Consult you?

03:21.243 --> 03:22.327
Yes.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.997
I am a partner in this business with you.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.666
Yet you keep making decisions
entirely without me!

03:27.749 --> 03:29.042
You treat me like a child.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.753
My dear boy, you are a child.
My God, look at yourself.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.089
It's almost noon,
and you're still in your dressing gown.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.216
I have been too busy to get changed.

03:36.300 --> 03:40.470
Too busy being frantic
about a tea party with your friends.

03:40.554 --> 03:44.224
Just one of the many aspects of your life
over which you seem to exhibit no control.

03:44.308 --> 03:47.895
I thought you made me a partner
in this firm because you value my opinion.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.981
I made you a partner in this firm
because you are my son.

03:52.149 --> 03:55.569
And if I hadn't, it would have
reflected badly on the family.

03:56.111 --> 03:59.406
Your opinions have nothing to do with it,

03:59.865 --> 04:02.367
least of all in matters of investment.

04:05.287 --> 04:09.791
Okay, well, just so you know,
I've invested in things too.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.503
Good things. Things that will
make the world a better place.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.671
Like what? Like your forged painting?

04:14.755 --> 04:16.839
You thought
I wouldn't find out about that.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.343
Honestly, to think of
everything I've given you.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.387
All the opportunities
I've handed to you on a plate,

04:22.471 --> 04:25.516
and what have you done with it all?
What have you accomplished?

04:26.558 --> 04:27.768
Nothing.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.605
It's just one failure after another.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.899
-I have--
-You say what you will about Emily,

04:34.691 --> 04:36.985
but at least she has her damn poems.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.446
Come in.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.365
Good morning, Dickinsons.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.118
Did I come at a bad time?

04:45.202 --> 04:49.623
No. I was just filling Austin in
on the exciting news of our joint venture.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.042
Yes. The newest members of our board.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.420
The fine upstanding leaders
of New England's largest daily newspaper.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.506
We are gonna change the world together.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.925
That is when it's not changing itself.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.220
Here.
You are not gonna believe this, Eddy.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.304
Can I call you Eddy?

05:04.388 --> 05:07.391
Here is a telegram
from Mr. Greeley down in New York.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.602
There's absolutely crazy news
coming out of Virginia right now.

05:10.686 --> 05:12.145
What news? What's happened?

05:12.229 --> 05:14.731
That madman, John Brown, the abolitionist?

05:14.815 --> 05:16.316
He tried to raid Harpers Ferry.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.194
John Brown.
That bloodthirsty man with the bowie knife

05:19.278 --> 05:20.612
that caused all that trouble
down in Kansas?

05:20.696 --> 05:21.864
Yes, exactly.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.408
The guy thinks of himself
as some kind of biblical prophet.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.911
I mean, what a face, crazy hair.
Has all the makings of a celebrity.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.372
We've been covering him
quite extensively in our paper.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.874
Just tell us what happened.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.501
Well, turns out
he formed a ragtag little army

05:34.585 --> 05:36.920
and tried to raid the federal arsenal
down at Harpers Ferry.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.549
I'm told his plan was to instigate
a massive slave rebellion in the South.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.467
Oh, my God, that's insane.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.136
Did it work?

05:44.219 --> 05:46.096
Of course not. It was a total shitshow.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.264
Most of his men were killed.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.184
The rest of them,
including Brown, will be in custody soon.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.895
Brown will be hanged for treason,
and I wouldn't be surprised

05:52.978 --> 05:55.480
if this doesn't heat things up
all the way to a civil war.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.774
No, it can't. It won't.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.359
Cooler heads will prevail.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.195
They can't prevail forever.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.698
I mean, this country's a tinderbox, and
this could be the match that lights it.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.116
God, what a disaster.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.368
Eddy, you're right. This is a disaster.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.120
But it could be good for us.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.039
What the hell does that mean?

06:12.831 --> 06:14.249
War sells papers, my friend.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.418
War sells papers.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.629
Even now, the rumors are flying.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.714
All of Brown's collaborators
will be exposed.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.217
I mean, the guy couldn't have
made more mistakes if he tried.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.011
All of his associates will be
tracked down, everyone who funded this,

06:26.094 --> 06:28.764
and we will sell hundreds of papers
as the facts come out.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.183
I mean,
thank God this guy was such a failure.

06:31.642 --> 06:34.394
No one is a failure
who stands up for what he believes in.

06:36.563 --> 06:37.773
Goodbye.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.441
You're not gonna stay for the meeting?

06:39.525 --> 06:41.193
No. I have better things to do

06:41.276 --> 06:43.946
than sit around and figure out
how to profit from war.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.989
Yes, he's having a tea party.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.912
Where's Emily?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.706
She's up in her bedroom.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.815
Henry. Thank God, you're safe.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.233
I'm not safe.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.235
I thought people were going to rise up.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.654
I thought this was the beginning
of a whole new world.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.740
Things will have to get worse
before they can get better.

07:28.824 --> 07:33.495
This country is gonna have to be destroyed
before it can be healed.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.455
Isn't there something that we can do?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.374
I'm doing what I have to do.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.834
I'm leaving.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.460
With my family.

07:41.837 --> 07:44.506
Betty was right.
I put my daughter's life at risk.

07:44.923 --> 07:48.218
And if they track us down,
Lord knows what they'll do.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.303
But...

07:50.053 --> 07:51.180
where will you go?

07:51.638 --> 07:52.973
I can't tell you that.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.435
Goodbye...

07:57.436 --> 07:58.604
Mr. Dickinson.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.650
Austin.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.737
Will I ever see you again?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.240
It doesn't seem likely.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.702
It's so nice of you to come all this way.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.120
Mary, it's nothing.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.747
It's been far too long.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.458
And it felt wrong, you know?

09:01.542 --> 09:04.211
To see so much of Sam
and so little of you.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.338
Well, most people see more of Sam.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.424
He loves to be out in the world.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.009
I prefer to stay home.

09:11.093 --> 09:12.302
Of course. I know that.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.055
But, Mary, I've missed you.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.265
Have you?

09:16.640 --> 09:18.267
You were once my dearest friend.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.353
Do you remember that summer?

09:21.937 --> 09:24.273
That incredibly hot summer in Geneva

09:24.356 --> 09:26.900
when you and I would go swimming
in the lake every day?

09:27.484 --> 09:30.112
Yes, that was the summer my father died.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.240
Was it that summer?

09:34.992 --> 09:36.618
I thought that was the summer after.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.829
The summer my father died.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.331
No, your father died
the year after my father.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.333
God.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.586
What happy childhoods we both had.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.299
Yes, things were difficult.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.383
I got you, Sam!

09:51.466 --> 09:52.467
Although...

09:53.302 --> 09:56.930
looking back on it now, it seems like
those were the easiest years of my life.

09:57.806 --> 09:58.807
Really?

09:59.766 --> 10:02.060
Are things very hard?

10:02.144 --> 10:03.145
Oh, you know,

10:03.228 --> 10:06.356
marriage, children,
it's all very challenging.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.152
Sam Jr.'s just like his father.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.278
Is he?

10:11.361 --> 10:12.571
In what way?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.366
Too much energy.

10:20.204 --> 10:23.123
You and Austin,
you still don't have children?

10:25.501 --> 10:28.921
Well, I suppose
that makes things easier in a way,

10:29.296 --> 10:31.507
especially since
you're so active in society.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.968
It's been quite something
reading about all of your salons.

10:35.052 --> 10:37.262
Your home sounds truly elegant.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.306
The Evergreens.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.517
It's really become
the center of the world.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.227
Yes.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.604
Well, obviously,
Sam has been a huge part of that,

10:45.687 --> 10:47.940
giving us such nice write-ups.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.942
He's been so generous.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.276
Indeed.

10:51.360 --> 10:56.990
Well, knowing Sam,
he must be getting something in return.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.326
In return?

10:59.409 --> 11:00.410
Yes.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.622
Some Amherst lady
has caught his eye, no doubt.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.124
I--

11:06.208 --> 11:10.295
But for now, I'm very glad he was able
to use his influence to help you.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.548
I've always loved you, Suzie.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.883
You were such a dear friend.

12:05.601 --> 12:08.729
We got drunk and we tobogganed
to Northampton and back. Hey!

12:08.812 --> 12:11.440
-And then Ship passed out on the quad.
-Yes. I did.

12:11.523 --> 12:14.776
The best day of my life,
and I don't even remember it.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.363
College ruled. Amherst forever!

12:20.449 --> 12:22.743
Life was so frolicsome.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.787
Gentlemen, tea is served.

12:26.288 --> 12:29.416
Now, I know George likes
lots of cream and lots of sugar.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.169
Shipley, of course,
is a no cream, lots of honey man.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.672
Archibald is a dash of milk, no sugar.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.133
Sylvester is a dash of sugar, no milk.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.303
My Austin likes his dark as night.

12:41.386 --> 12:44.932
And Toshiaki prefers green,
for it reminds him of home.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.644
Actually, Mrs. D, I'm taking a break
from caffeine this month.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.687
I'll just take some hot water with lemon.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.690
Look in your cup, Mr. Toshiaki.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.108
I think you'll be pleased.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.029
It's just hot water with lemon.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.614
How did you know?

13:00.697 --> 13:02.950
Now, let me go fetch the scones.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.499
Hey, Austin?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.377
It's so cool of you to organize this.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.629
I can't remember
the last time we were all together.

13:15.712 --> 13:16.755
Even Shipley's here.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.633
Yeah. Well, Shipley's
been boarding with my parents.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.260
Yeah, I moved out yesterday though.

13:21.343 --> 13:23.929
But then I heard
we're having a bro hang so I'm back.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.515
Ship is engaged to Lavinia.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.267
-What?
-What? You're joking.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.601
-No.
-Congrats!

13:29.685 --> 13:30.894
The engagement is off.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.939
I don't have good luck with women.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.482
Well...

13:35.899 --> 13:37.484
I'm just glad that we all made it.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.319
I miss you guys.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.571
And everyone's here.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.448
No. Not everyone.
We're still waiting for Frazar.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.533
Wait, Frazar?

13:44.616 --> 13:46.159
-Frazar Stearns is coming?
-Yes.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.953
-I thought he was at West Point.
-He is.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.497
But he's on a break right now,
and I ran into him at the opera.

13:50.581 --> 13:52.291
-Opera!
-Yeah, so I invited him.

13:52.374 --> 13:56.503
It was actually seeing Frazar that gave me
the idea to put together this reunion.

13:56.587 --> 13:58.797
-Frazar's such a good guy.
-Can't wait to see him.

13:58.881 --> 14:02.342
God, it's so good to have
the gang back together again, right?

14:02.426 --> 14:03.844
Yeah.

14:04.428 --> 14:07.723
And if there's a war coming,
at least we have each other.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.352
Bro. Way to kill the mood, bro.

14:12.436 --> 14:14.563
Are you talking about
the situation down at Harpers Ferry?

14:14.646 --> 14:15.898
Yeah. John Brown.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.025
John Brown is the worst.

14:18.108 --> 14:21.028
All those Brown Bros want
is to just burn everything down.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.696
I think they might be right.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.908
Or, even if they're wrong,
it's too late to stop them.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.993
Dickinson, you're being a bed-wetter.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.371
The polls say no one wants war,
and polls are never wrong.

14:31.455 --> 14:33.373
Right. And piggybacking off of that,

14:33.457 --> 14:35.834
I know I said
I'm out of the prediction business,

14:35.918 --> 14:37.753
but I bet it's all gonna be fine.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.505
Maybe, but what if it's not?

14:39.588 --> 14:41.215
What if things were never fine?

14:41.757 --> 14:43.759
And what if they need to get worse
before they get better?

14:43.842 --> 14:45.636
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys, crazy idea.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.640
-What if we did this every week?
-Did what?

14:49.723 --> 14:51.558
Like, got together
and talked about politics.

14:51.642 --> 14:55.687
Like, just hanging out but also analyzing
the political situation and stuff.

14:55.771 --> 14:57.606
And what if we got someone to record it?

14:57.689 --> 14:59.900
Like write it all down or whatever,

14:59.983 --> 15:02.444
and then people could
kind of, you know, tune in.

15:02.528 --> 15:04.029
We could do advertisements...

15:04.905 --> 15:07.241
for aprons.

15:07.824 --> 15:08.992
Blue aprons.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.329
Hot fresh scones for everyone, with jam.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.250
Don't you guys realize if there's a war,
we'll be expected to fight?

15:16.708 --> 15:20.337
This isn't like when we were kids
playing with our little toy soldiers.

15:21.255 --> 15:24.591
Thousands of people,
real people, will die.

15:24.675 --> 15:26.260
People like us.

15:26.343 --> 15:29.304
And our generation,
we'll be on the front lines.

15:30.556 --> 15:32.808
It's like Abraham Lincoln said
at the convention,

15:33.308 --> 15:35.561
"A house divided cannot stand."

15:36.436 --> 15:38.313
Oh, that's nonsense.

15:39.106 --> 15:39.940
Mom?

15:40.023 --> 15:42.943
If I can find a way
to serve two perfect tea parties,

15:43.026 --> 15:46.238
we Americans can figure out
how to keep our country together.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.115
You know, I'm curious

15:48.198 --> 15:51.493
how you intend to cover
this whole Harpers Ferry event?

15:51.577 --> 15:54.621
The key is endorsing John Brown's spirit
but not his actions.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.582
See, we gotta keep
those abolitionists on board

15:56.665 --> 16:00.586
whilst at the same time not alienating
our moderate and, in some cases,

16:00.669 --> 16:02.087
Southern-leaning readership.

16:02.671 --> 16:05.799
With that strategy, The Republican can
soon be one of the biggest papers in the--

16:06.717 --> 16:08.051
Not to worry. I'll get that.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.096
I wonder how much longer
this will be a country.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.764
It might be two countries soon.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.893
Well, if that's the case,
we'll need to have a presence in both.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.979
In this information boom,
it's all about the eyeballs.

16:19.062 --> 16:22.566
We need as many as possible glued
to our pages for as long as possible.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.109
It's an attention economy.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.659
Shut the door behind you, Mother.

16:32.743 --> 16:34.578
We're discussing matters of state in here.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.455
Yes, Edward.

16:36.914 --> 16:39.917
Well, in my opinion...

16:42.127 --> 16:45.130
maybe wars wouldn't happen
if men simply had better manners.

16:58.310 --> 16:59.353
Mr. Shipley.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.480
-Hello.
-Hey, Mrs. D.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.524
Those scones were dope.

17:03.607 --> 17:06.359
Well, thank you for saying so.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.780
I worked so hard today.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.574
I threw two impeccable tea parties,

17:13.282 --> 17:14.617
but nobody even noticed.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.786
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.496
Are you kidding? I noticed.

17:18.372 --> 17:19.873
You're a domestic goddess, Mrs. D.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.541
Honestly.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.252
You live up to every ideal of womanhood.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.048
That's truly very kind.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.925
-Thank you.
-I want a wife just like you.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.637
It's why I'm here
trying to make up with Lavinia.

17:35.055 --> 17:38.058
Because who could be
more like a mother than her daughter?

17:40.561 --> 17:42.271
I thought the engagement was off?

17:43.897 --> 17:48.193
Listen. If there's a civil war coming,
I want someone to love me through it.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.452
Thank you, Mr. Shipley.

18:04.001 --> 18:06.420
Lavinia? We need to talk.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.088
Ship, you need to knock.

18:08.172 --> 18:09.673
The country is on the verge of war,

18:09.756 --> 18:12.926
and I don't want there to be
any conflict between us.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.720
What are you talking about?

18:14.803 --> 18:16.180
We gotta work this out, Vinnie.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.473
You're the perfect wife for me,
and I know it.

18:20.184 --> 18:21.185
Let's get married.

18:23.103 --> 18:26.648
Ship, we broke up because you can't ever
accept me for who I am.

18:26.732 --> 18:30.569
One minute I'm too sexual,
the next I'm too intellectual.

18:32.196 --> 18:33.739
You'll never love the real Lavinia.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.033
I will. I mean, I do. I do, Vinnie.

18:36.491 --> 18:37.910
How can I prove it to you?

18:37.993 --> 18:43.165
How can I show you that nothing
you could ever do would turn me away?

18:47.711 --> 18:48.921
I have an idea.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.381
Taste my whip.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.258
What?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.151
What the hell?

19:34.842 --> 19:35.926
Yes.

19:55.112 --> 19:57.114
I was sorry to hear that you've been sick.

19:57.948 --> 19:58.949
Are you better now?

19:59.283 --> 20:00.284
Sick?

20:04.371 --> 20:07.416
I see.
That's what Sam's been telling everyone.

20:09.001 --> 20:10.169
So, you haven't been sick?

20:10.252 --> 20:11.587
Not physically, no.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.046
So...

20:13.755 --> 20:14.756
What then?

20:18.218 --> 20:19.219
You see...

20:22.556 --> 20:24.975
We were going to
have a baby girl this year.

20:27.019 --> 20:28.020
But...

20:28.896 --> 20:29.897
she died.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.274
Inside of me.

20:34.193 --> 20:35.319
God, Mary.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.030
I'm so sorry.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.157
I... I just...

20:41.783 --> 20:42.784
lost it.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.295
Something like that...

20:56.006 --> 20:57.841
Something like that happened to me.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.595
Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.686
It's like I have been trying...

21:12.981 --> 21:16.485
I have been trying to push the pain away.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.571
You don't have to push it away.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.241
It's okay to feel it.

21:40.050 --> 21:41.218
Must be Frazar.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.636
Frazar Stearns.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.180
-Man, I can't wait to see him.
-We are ready.

21:49.893 --> 21:50.936
Fra--

21:51.019 --> 21:52.646
Emily. It's you.

21:55.107 --> 21:56.650
Were you expecting someone else?

21:56.733 --> 21:58.068
Yes, but it's good to see you.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.236
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.113
Why don't I take this?

22:03.782 --> 22:05.033
Are you okay?

22:09.288 --> 22:10.289
I don't know.

22:11.748 --> 22:14.960
Well, some of the guys
are over having tea.

22:15.794 --> 22:16.795
You wanna join?

22:17.880 --> 22:18.881
Yeah.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.216
That's why I'm here.

22:22.092 --> 22:24.261
I just think I need
to be around people right now.

22:26.221 --> 22:27.222
Okay.

22:31.518 --> 22:34.188
Well, maybe not.
I'm not really sure. Just kinda--

22:36.690 --> 22:38.108
-Emily.
-Hey, George.

22:41.111 --> 22:43.322
You guys remember my sister, Emily.

22:45.032 --> 22:46.575
What have you all been up to?

22:46.658 --> 22:47.659
Oh, you know.

22:48.035 --> 22:49.328
Talking about the news.

22:50.037 --> 22:51.747
What a crazy day this is.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.957
Not as crazy as the shit going on up here.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.046
God, it's like there's a kind of cleaving
in my mind like my brain is split.

23:01.548 --> 23:02.758
Do you guys ever have that?

23:05.802 --> 23:07.763
Not this week. No.

23:08.680 --> 23:09.806
Don't mind me.

23:10.599 --> 23:12.100
I'll just stare at the fire.

23:25.948 --> 23:29.409
Maybe we should
stop talking about politics.

23:29.493 --> 23:31.411
Honestly, I don't want to spend
my fun afternoon

23:31.495 --> 23:34.122
imagining all my friends dying in a war.

23:36.625 --> 23:38.126
The man - to die - tomorrow -

23:38.877 --> 23:41.255
Harks for the meadow bird -

23:42.923 --> 23:47.135
Because its music stirs the axe
that clamors for his head

23:51.974 --> 23:52.975
I'll get it.

23:56.812 --> 23:58.021
She's fun.

24:02.234 --> 24:04.361
Hi. Emily, right?

24:07.698 --> 24:09.741
You're... Nobody.

24:11.785 --> 24:13.161
No. I'm--

24:13.245 --> 24:14.997
Frazar! Hey!

24:15.455 --> 24:16.665
There you are.

24:17.249 --> 24:18.584
You're here.

24:21.295 --> 24:24.131
Emily, this is Frazar Stearns,
my old college friend.

24:24.214 --> 24:25.799
-You remember him, don't you?
-Yeah.

24:25.883 --> 24:27.801
I think we met at a couple of those
house parties you used to throw.

24:27.885 --> 24:30.095
This is Nobody. He's Nobody.

24:30.179 --> 24:31.555
You're-- You're Nobody.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.473
Emily, don't be rude.

24:33.557 --> 24:35.434
My sister can be a little strange.
Please don't be offended.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.019
No, no. That's okay. I remember.

24:39.646 --> 24:40.564
Oh, God.

24:43.442 --> 24:44.443
You're gonna die.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.111
Emily, stop it.

24:46.195 --> 24:48.238
No, Austin. He's going to die.
I have seen it!

24:50.449 --> 24:52.868
Don't you remember? The field?

24:54.036 --> 24:57.831
The explosion, the battle, the bullet.
It hits you like a bird.

24:57.915 --> 25:00.125
Okay, this is starting
to get a little intense.

25:00.209 --> 25:02.127
You need to get out of here.
Save yourself!

25:02.211 --> 25:03.837
-Leave--
-Emily! Emily, that's enough.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.340
Listen, the guys are in the parlor.

25:06.423 --> 25:09.343
Go get some tea while I figure out
how to manage my sister.

25:09.426 --> 25:10.636
Okay. Thanks.

25:11.637 --> 25:12.596
Em.

25:14.848 --> 25:16.475
Oh, my God. Sue.

25:17.976 --> 25:20.145
So, it's real. It's all real.

25:20.896 --> 25:23.649
Emily, what was that?
You can't do that to people.

25:23.732 --> 25:27.694
I was hoping I was crazy,
but everything I saw yesterday,

25:27.778 --> 25:30.364
-everything I experienced--
-What are you talking about?

25:30.447 --> 25:33.408
Austin, I have to tell you something.
I have to tell you something terrible.

25:34.451 --> 25:35.452
What?

25:39.081 --> 25:42.918
Sue has betrayed you with Sam.

25:43.752 --> 25:45.379
I saw them in here.

25:46.922 --> 25:48.131
I'm so sorry.

25:50.843 --> 25:52.177
Did you not hear what I said?

25:52.261 --> 25:54.596
-Sue cheated on you.
-I know about that already.

25:56.557 --> 25:57.558
You do?

25:58.350 --> 25:59.351
Yeah.

26:00.143 --> 26:01.186
I've known for weeks.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.570
Well, great.

26:13.824 --> 26:16.034
I guess that means
you know everything then.

26:17.411 --> 26:18.829
You know about Sam.

26:19.371 --> 26:20.706
You know about the baby.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.416
What baby?

26:27.296 --> 26:28.297
Emily.

26:30.007 --> 26:31.008
What baby?

26:33.635 --> 26:34.761
I can't say.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.430
Yes, you can.

26:38.098 --> 26:39.308
You just said it.

26:40.017 --> 26:41.977
Emily! What baby?

26:42.060 --> 26:43.896
Sue's and yours.

26:45.939 --> 26:47.149
Sue had a baby?

26:47.733 --> 26:51.153
No, no, no. She didn't.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.034
When?

26:58.285 --> 27:01.705
At your wedding.
She was pregnant, but then she miscarried.

27:02.581 --> 27:06.210
I'm sorry. Austin, I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

27:13.217 --> 27:15.135
Can you just--
Can you please say something?

27:15.219 --> 27:16.303
Austin?

27:17.513 --> 27:19.139
Just say something. Austin!

27:19.223 --> 27:20.265
Oh, God.

27:22.601 --> 27:23.727
Dad was right.

27:25.103 --> 27:27.731
I'm a failure. I'm a total utter failure.

27:28.232 --> 27:30.275
-I'm a joke.
-No, that is not true.

27:30.359 --> 27:32.569
Yes, it is, Emily.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.321
Yes.

27:35.155 --> 27:36.240
You don't understand.

27:38.408 --> 27:40.953
Nothing I do works.

27:41.870 --> 27:45.290
Everything I touch breaks.

27:48.001 --> 27:51.046
I've been trying so hard to find meaning.

27:51.129 --> 27:53.549
To find something...

27:55.467 --> 27:57.678
that will make Sue love me.

27:58.595 --> 28:01.348
But nothing I do will ever matter.

28:02.057 --> 28:03.684
I'm a joke, Emily.

28:05.811 --> 28:06.937
A fraud...

28:09.940 --> 28:13.151
with a hole inside
that nothing can ever fill.

28:28.166 --> 28:32.045
I like a look of agony
Because I know it's true -

28:35.132 --> 28:37.259
Men do not sham convulsion

28:38.010 --> 28:39.553
Nor simulate a Throe -

28:45.100 --> 28:48.520
The Eyes glaze once and that is death

28:50.606 --> 28:52.024
Impossible to feign

29:03.827 --> 29:05.495
The Beads upon the Forehead

29:11.960 --> 29:13.962
By homely Anguish strung.

29:20.719 --> 29:21.762
Austin.

29:25.474 --> 29:28.685
You are not a fraud.

29:32.022 --> 29:34.650
In fact,
you are the most genuine person I know.

29:38.320 --> 29:41.657
You are so full of love.
You have so much love to give.

29:41.740 --> 29:43.867
And none of us could survive without it...

29:46.453 --> 29:47.663
least of all me.

29:53.794 --> 29:55.212
Do you really mean that?

29:59.007 --> 30:00.634
Don't I always say what I mean?

30:19.611 --> 30:21.947
Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.

30:22.030 --> 30:24.324
-I didn't mean to scare you.
-It's okay.

30:25.826 --> 30:28.203
I'm training to be a soldier,
I gotta be tough.

30:31.081 --> 30:33.584
I enjoyed your poem, by the way.

30:33.667 --> 30:34.918
What?

30:35.711 --> 30:36.795
Your poem.

30:37.838 --> 30:38.881
In the paper?

30:39.381 --> 30:43.093
Oh. Right. Thank you.

30:44.052 --> 30:45.637
I thought it was beautiful.

30:46.346 --> 30:47.472
Do you have more?

30:48.015 --> 30:49.474
I'd love to read them.

30:51.435 --> 30:52.603
I did have more.

30:54.855 --> 30:56.565
But I gave them all to my editor.

31:00.068 --> 31:01.195
Terrible mistake.

31:02.154 --> 31:04.698
Why? You don't wanna be published?

31:05.240 --> 31:06.450
Part of me does.

31:09.411 --> 31:10.412
Or did.

31:13.832 --> 31:17.085
But another part of me is
pretty sure that fame isn't good for me.

31:20.464 --> 31:22.841
In fact,
I think it could be very dangerous.

31:24.635 --> 31:25.761
How so?

31:32.017 --> 31:33.435
How can I put this?

31:37.731 --> 31:40.150
If fame belonged to me
I could not escape her--

31:42.903 --> 31:45.030
In that case,
you'd better get your poems back.
