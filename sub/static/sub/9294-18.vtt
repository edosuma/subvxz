00:13.030 --> 00:14.358
Mr Knowles, my name is Jack Bauer.

00:14.398 --> 00:16.126
Jonas Hodges is in possession

00:16.166 --> 00:18.267
Of a military-grade bio-weapon.

00:18.336 --> 00:20.665
I was contaminated when trying
to intercept the canisters.

00:20.705 --> 00:21.959
I promise you, sir,

00:22.005 --> 00:23.301
The weapon is on your base.

00:23.341 --> 00:24.402
Do you have any idea

00:24.442 --> 00:25.869
Where they might be? Think I might.

00:25.909 --> 00:29.139
I have an order from the
president of the United States.

00:29.179 --> 00:30.441
To search this building.

00:30.481 --> 00:32.042
Are there weapons of mass destruction?

00:32.082 --> 00:33.611
Are there weapons of any kind?

00:33.651 --> 00:34.845
You've got five minutes

00:34.885 --> 00:37.014
To get these helicopters flying out of here

00:37.054 --> 00:38.449
With all of you on board.

00:38.489 --> 00:39.684
Larry, I want you and your men

00:39.724 --> 00:41.118
To pull out on Hodges' timetable.

00:41.158 --> 00:43.153
Tony, you're gonna need to
find a way to stay behind.

00:43.193 --> 00:45.055
We're gonna get your vectors over to a man

00:45.095 --> 00:46.390
That we contacted inside Starkwood.

00:46.430 --> 00:47.558
His name is Douglas Knowles.

00:47.598 --> 00:49.059
He believes he knows where the weapons are.

00:49.099 --> 00:51.634
Stay here. I'll be right back.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.871
Jack!

00:54.938 --> 00:56.339
We need a medic!

00:56.407 --> 00:58.369
The bio-agent is more virulent than we thought.

00:58.409 --> 00:59.903
All we're doing here is just masking

00:59.943 --> 01:01.725
The symptoms. I understand.

01:02.913 --> 01:04.208
There's something you may want to consider.

01:04.248 --> 01:05.447
What's that?

01:05.516 --> 01:06.510
A possible treatment using stem cells

01:06.550 --> 01:08.178
From a genetically compatible donor.

01:08.218 --> 01:09.480
I saw your file, and it says

01:09.520 --> 01:10.648
You have a daughter.

01:10.688 --> 01:13.857
I don't want my daughter involved in this.

01:13.924 --> 01:15.892
It should be her choice.

01:15.959 --> 01:16.993
Well, it's not.

01:17.060 --> 01:18.661
I'm the one who's dying.

01:18.729 --> 01:19.896
I'm in.

01:19.963 --> 01:21.498
But they got Knowles.

01:21.565 --> 01:23.366
A little loyalty.

01:23.434 --> 01:25.195
Wasn't that the least I deserved?

01:25.235 --> 01:27.941
You can't take on the federal government.

01:31.909 --> 01:34.377
I have a visual on the weapon.

01:34.445 --> 01:35.840
Okay, those are the canisters.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.268
I'll notify admiral Smith the

01:37.308 --> 01:38.882
target is locate

01:38.949 --> 01:41.879
You remember Starkwood was deployed to Pakistan,

01:41.919 --> 01:44.715
That we requisitioned a
missile system at that time.

01:44.755 --> 01:47.256
Well, three of those missiles

01:47.324 --> 01:48.786
Are now loaded with a pathogen

01:48.826 --> 01:51.895
And aimed at cities on our eastern seaboard.

01:51.962 --> 01:53.924
You will keep this conversation to yourself

01:53.964 --> 01:55.125
And turn the planes around.

01:55.165 --> 01:57.561
And if you do not comply, madam president,

01:57.601 --> 01:59.268
I will have no choice

01:59.336 --> 02:01.098
But to launch those missiles.

02:01.138 --> 02:03.100
Abort the air strike, admiral Smith.

02:03.140 --> 02:04.268
Ma'am, with all respect…

02:04.308 --> 02:05.302
Damn it, admiral.

02:05.342 --> 02:07.520
Abort the air strike immediately!

02:34.972 --> 02:36.305
Tony, it's Jack.

02:36.373 --> 02:37.474
Do you copy?

02:37.541 --> 02:38.969
Jack, what the hell is going on?

02:39.009 --> 02:40.237
Where are those F-18s?

02:40.277 --> 02:42.105
Tim woods just called from the white house.

02:42.145 --> 02:43.908
The president canceled the air strike.

02:43.948 --> 02:44.914
What?

02:44.982 --> 02:45.982
Why?

02:46.049 --> 02:47.411
She doesn't believe our intel

02:47.451 --> 02:49.212
Is strong enough to justify military action.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.887
Is she out of her mind?

02:50.955 --> 02:53.116
Jack, I saw those canisters
with my own eyes.

02:53.156 --> 02:54.652
So did you. They're in that bunker.

02:54.692 --> 02:57.254
She's not gonna get any better
intel than that. I know.

02:57.294 --> 02:58.656
It doesn't make any sense, but right now,

02:58.696 --> 03:00.223
We've got a presidential order to pull you out

03:00.263 --> 03:01.792
Of the Starkwood compound, along
with the perimeter teams.

03:01.832 --> 03:03.260
Tony, Larry's been told the president's decision.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.496
He's preparing to move his
teams out, but he's got

03:05.536 --> 03:06.964
To get you out of there first.

03:07.004 --> 03:09.032
He'll be sending you coordinates
for an exfiltration point

03:09.072 --> 03:11.273
Along the southwest perimeter.

03:11.341 --> 03:12.575
Tony?

03:12.643 --> 03:14.644
Hold on a second.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.653
Tony, what's going on?

03:23.721 --> 03:25.354
Jack, I might know

03:25.422 --> 03:27.417
Why the president called off that air strike.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.925
What do you mean?

03:28.993 --> 03:32.461
I think Starkwood's got
surface-to-surface missiles.

03:32.530 --> 03:34.257
That's how they're gonna deploy the bio-weapon.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.765
How do you know this?

03:35.833 --> 03:38.028
A fuel truck just pulled up next to the bunker

03:38.068 --> 03:40.312
Where they're storing the weapons.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.968
They're pumping RP-7 into an underground depot.

03:44.008 --> 03:45.642
What's RP-7?

03:45.709 --> 03:48.205
It's a propellant only used in
surface-to-surface missiles.

03:48.245 --> 03:49.406
Tony, are you sure?

03:49.446 --> 03:51.426
I'm looking right at it, Jack.

03:53.350 --> 03:54.912
Do you have any C4 on you?

03:54.952 --> 03:56.547
Yeah, I've got three charges
and a remote detonator.

03:56.587 --> 03:57.854
Do you think

03:57.922 --> 03:59.650
You can gain access to the
underground fuel depot?

03:59.690 --> 04:01.184
Yeah, I think we've got a play,

04:01.224 --> 04:02.820
But I've got to move soon…

04:02.860 --> 04:04.588
Before that fuel truck pulls away.

04:04.628 --> 04:06.223
Okay, I want you to maintain your position.

04:06.263 --> 04:07.591
I'm gonna call the president.

04:07.631 --> 04:09.599
Come with me.

04:13.771 --> 04:15.672
What is it, Tim?

04:17.841 --> 04:19.904
Madam president, the joint chiefs

04:19.944 --> 04:21.505
Are beginning to question your decision

04:21.545 --> 04:24.441
To call off the air strike against Starkwood.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.944
They think the intelligence
we received from Tony Almeida

04:26.984 --> 04:29.112
Was sufficient and that we may be missing

04:29.152 --> 04:30.514
An opportunity to destroy the bio-weapons.

04:30.554 --> 04:32.521
I gave my orders, Tim.

04:32.590 --> 04:34.156
No air strike.

04:34.224 --> 04:37.694
No military action of any kind against Starkwood.

04:39.162 --> 04:40.558
Now, I asked you to handle

04:40.598 --> 04:42.059
The joint chiefs; handle them.

04:42.099 --> 04:43.293
I'll do my best, ma'am,

04:43.333 --> 04:44.500
But if I may…

04:44.568 --> 04:46.020
What is our next move?

04:48.739 --> 04:51.511
Jonas Hodges is coming to the white house.

04:52.576 --> 04:54.877
He wants to speak with me alone.

04:54.945 --> 04:58.014
For what possible reason? I don't know.

04:58.082 --> 04:59.643
Madam president, shouldn't your advisors

04:59.683 --> 05:00.644
Be at that meeting?

05:00.684 --> 05:02.664
Tim, stop asking me questions.

05:06.023 --> 05:07.657
If you want to help,

05:07.725 --> 05:09.720
Make sure as few people as possible know

05:09.760 --> 05:11.321
That Jonas Hodges is coming here.

05:11.361 --> 05:12.962
And bring him in

05:13.030 --> 05:15.698
Through the southeast service entrance.

05:17.101 --> 05:18.034
Yes?

05:18.102 --> 05:19.429
Madam president, Jack Bauer

05:19.469 --> 05:20.965
And Renée Walker are calling from FBI.

05:21.005 --> 05:22.132
You did speak to FBI?

05:22.172 --> 05:24.473
Yes, ma'am, five minutes ago.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.003
I gave them your reason for calling off

05:26.043 --> 05:27.571
The air strike, but I must warn you,

05:27.611 --> 05:29.006
They were skeptical as well.

05:29.046 --> 05:30.947
Be ready for Hodges.

05:36.987 --> 05:38.220
Mr Bauer,

05:38.288 --> 05:39.783
Agent Walker, this is the president.

05:39.823 --> 05:41.351
Madam president, we need to talk.

05:41.391 --> 05:43.626
No, Mr Bauer, we don't.

05:43.694 --> 05:44.822
You need to listen.

05:44.862 --> 05:46.490
I appreciate everything that you have done

05:46.530 --> 05:47.791
In gathering this intel,

05:47.831 --> 05:48.993
But I still need more

05:49.033 --> 05:50.928
Before I can authorize an air strike.

05:50.968 --> 05:51.901
I'm sorry.

05:51.969 --> 05:53.263
Madam president, with all due respect,

05:53.303 --> 05:54.498
I don't believe you're being truthful

05:54.538 --> 05:56.706
With us.

05:56.774 --> 05:58.240
Excuse me?

05:58.308 --> 05:59.703
I think you called off the air strike

05:59.743 --> 06:01.038
Because Jonas Hodges is in possession

06:01.078 --> 06:02.205
Of surface-to-surface missiles

06:02.245 --> 06:03.373
Armed with the bio-weapon,

06:03.413 --> 06:04.842
And he's threatening to use them

06:04.882 --> 06:07.720
In case you try to take action against him.

06:07.751 --> 06:09.647
Madam president, Tony Almeida witnessed a truck

06:09.687 --> 06:12.783
Pumping RP-7 rocket fuel
into an underground depot

06:12.823 --> 06:14.184
Situated right next to the bunker

06:14.224 --> 06:16.020
Where the bio-weapons are being stored.

06:16.060 --> 06:18.421
The only purpose for RP-7 rocket fuel

06:18.461 --> 06:19.913
Is to launch missiles.

06:23.033 --> 06:26.135
Madam president, please just tell us the truth.

06:26.670 --> 06:29.772
Jack, Hodges has 13 python missiles

06:29.840 --> 06:31.568
Armed with the bio-weapons.

06:31.608 --> 06:34.844
Three are currently aimed at American cities.

06:34.912 --> 06:36.674
He demanded that I recall the planes,

06:36.714 --> 06:37.675
Or he would launch.

06:37.715 --> 06:38.809
What does Hodges want?

06:38.849 --> 06:39.982
I don't know…

06:40.050 --> 06:41.311
But he's requested a face-to-face meeting.

06:41.351 --> 06:43.380
He'll be at the white house in a few minutes.

06:43.420 --> 06:44.848
Madam president, the only reason he wants

06:44.888 --> 06:46.817
A face-to-face meeting is to lay out his demands,

06:46.857 --> 06:48.919
And whatever they are, you
cannot negotiate with him.

06:48.959 --> 06:51.354
I'm not planning on negotiating
with him, Jack.

06:51.394 --> 06:54.163
Once he places his cards on the table,

06:54.231 --> 06:56.827
I am sure that I can… I can make him realize

06:56.867 --> 06:59.296
The futility of what he is trying to do.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.899
Jonas Hodges is a traitor and a terrorist,

07:01.939 --> 07:03.333
And after everything that's happened today,

07:03.373 --> 07:04.501
Are you really naive enough

07:04.541 --> 07:06.369
To believe that you can simply talk to him

07:06.409 --> 07:07.437
And change his mind?

07:07.477 --> 07:09.039
I'm not new at this, Jack,

07:09.079 --> 07:11.041
And right now, I don't have another option.

07:11.081 --> 07:12.209
Madam president, you do.

07:12.249 --> 07:13.711
Tony Almeida is still inside Starkwood.

07:13.751 --> 07:15.512
I ordered him exfiltrated immediately.

07:15.552 --> 07:16.714
What's he still doing there?

07:16.754 --> 07:19.616
I asked him to stand by
until I could talk to you.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.685
He believes he can gain access to the fuel depot

07:21.725 --> 07:23.253
And lay a series of explosive charges

07:23.293 --> 07:24.855
And take the missiles out.

07:24.895 --> 07:27.324
Now, I believe this can work,
but we need to act quickly.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.692
What about the bio-weapons?

07:28.732 --> 07:31.161
RP-7 rocket fuel burns at 5,000 degrees.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.662
There will be nothing left.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.798
Once the weapons are destroyed,
Larry Moss and his teams

07:34.838 --> 07:37.067
Can move in on Starkwood and lock it down.

07:37.107 --> 07:39.436
Hodges gave standing orders to his men

07:39.476 --> 07:41.638
To launch the missiles at the first detection

07:41.678 --> 07:43.579
Of government interference.

07:43.647 --> 07:45.042
If Almeida is detected,

07:45.082 --> 07:47.377
Thousands of Americans will die, Jack.

07:47.417 --> 07:49.079
Madam president, I know that there's a risk,

07:49.119 --> 07:51.148
But I would not be asking you to do this

07:51.188 --> 07:53.300
If I didn't think it would work.

07:53.356 --> 07:55.524
Please, I am begging you.

07:55.592 --> 07:57.226
Trust me.

08:02.632 --> 08:03.961
How long did the doctors

08:04.001 --> 08:05.567
Give you to live?

08:08.338 --> 08:09.738
Uh, they're not sure,

08:09.807 --> 08:13.742
But the pathogen has started to take effect.

08:16.313 --> 08:20.009
Then there's not much I can
threaten you with, is there?

08:20.750 --> 08:24.153
I expect you'll do what you think is right.

08:33.163 --> 08:35.530
What the hell does that mean?

08:35.597 --> 08:37.433
She wants us to go in.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.001
But she didn't authorize it.

08:40.070 --> 08:41.136
She can't.

08:41.205 --> 08:43.299
She needs this to be a covert operation.

08:43.340 --> 08:44.701
If something were to go wrong

08:44.741 --> 08:46.270
And those missiles were to be launched,

08:46.310 --> 08:47.838
The president needs to be able to swear

08:47.878 --> 08:49.039
Under oath that we were working

08:49.079 --> 08:50.012
On our own.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.275
She wants us to go in.

08:51.315 --> 08:53.716
Notify Larry. We need to move fast.

08:58.155 --> 09:00.383
I told you I'd get you to the white house.

09:00.423 --> 09:02.524
I just didn't think it would be

09:02.592 --> 09:04.327
Under these conditions.

09:06.897 --> 09:08.679
It was brilliant, you know.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.295
What was that, sir?

09:11.335 --> 09:13.802
What you did to make Almeida think

09:13.871 --> 09:15.804
That you were betraying me.

09:15.873 --> 09:17.340
Quite brilliant.

09:17.407 --> 09:20.109
Thank you, sir.

09:20.177 --> 09:22.745
You put yourself in harm's way, Greg,

09:22.812 --> 09:24.847
And I'll never forget that.

09:27.851 --> 09:30.552
I can't believe… I'm feeling nervous.

09:30.620 --> 09:32.922
You're gonna do fine, sir.

09:34.258 --> 09:35.324
Thank you, Tim.

09:35.392 --> 09:36.759
You're welcome.

09:38.262 --> 09:40.090
So, it sounds to me like the president

09:40.130 --> 09:41.691
Didn't actually authorize this.

09:41.731 --> 09:42.865
Technically, no.

09:42.933 --> 09:45.128
It was more of an… an indirect order,

09:45.168 --> 09:47.197
But believe me, Larry, she wants this to happen.

09:47.237 --> 09:48.866
She's gonna meet with Hodges,

09:48.906 --> 09:51.414
And we're gonna blow those fuel tanks.

09:51.775 --> 09:53.009
Larry, do you have

09:53.076 --> 09:54.743
A problem with this?

09:57.047 --> 09:58.680
As a matter of fact, no.

09:58.748 --> 10:00.149
None whatsoever.

10:00.217 --> 10:02.512
These Starkwood bastards drew on my men.

10:02.552 --> 10:04.248
I'm looking forward to getting back in there.

10:04.288 --> 10:06.483
All right, have your teams hold their position

10:06.523 --> 10:07.550
And be ready to move.

10:07.590 --> 10:09.052
Believe me, you'll know when it happens.

10:09.092 --> 10:11.360
All right.

10:26.276 --> 10:27.343
Tony,

10:27.411 --> 10:29.072
–It's Jack. Do you copy?
–Yeah, I'm here.

10:29.112 --> 10:30.107
You were right about the missiles.

10:30.147 --> 10:31.141
The president confirmed it.

10:31.181 --> 10:32.175
We're gonna have to carry this out

10:32.215 --> 10:33.443
As a covert operation.

10:33.483 --> 10:35.178
Larry and his men are standing
by to lock down Starkwood

10:35.218 --> 10:36.813
As soon as the missiles have been destroyed.

10:36.853 --> 10:37.853
Good. Tony…

10:37.921 --> 10:39.516
I need to know that you can do this

10:39.556 --> 10:40.717
Without being detected.

10:40.757 --> 10:42.319
Hodges's given his men standing orders

10:42.359 --> 10:44.587
To launch those missiles if
there's a breach of any kind.

10:44.627 --> 10:46.728
Yeah. I can do it.

10:46.796 --> 10:48.597
Okay. Good luck.

10:48.665 --> 10:50.666
Yeah.

11:02.645 --> 11:04.580
We're done here.

11:04.647 --> 11:06.843
I'm going to go run a perimeter check.

11:06.883 --> 11:08.611
You said you just finished one.

11:08.651 --> 11:10.019
I know.

11:10.087 --> 11:13.387
But I don't think we can
be too careful right now.

11:34.644 --> 11:36.612
It's me. Yeah.

11:36.679 --> 11:38.141
Auxiliary tanks are fueled and ready.

11:38.181 --> 11:39.615
Confirmed.

11:39.682 --> 11:41.345
I'll be down in a few minutes.

11:41.385 --> 11:42.385
Copy that.

11:45.655 --> 11:46.922
Freeze!

11:46.990 --> 11:48.991
Let me see your hands.

11:51.661 --> 11:53.695
Almeida.

11:53.763 --> 11:56.032
Put your gun on the ground.

11:56.099 --> 11:58.100
Slowly.

12:03.373 --> 12:04.306
Kick it.

12:08.412 --> 12:10.346
Drag him under the truck.

12:10.414 --> 12:11.514
Now! Let's go!

12:24.227 --> 12:25.861
Hands up.

12:25.929 --> 12:27.657
What do you think you're doing?

12:27.697 --> 12:29.592
You're going to take me do to the fuel tan ks.

12:29.632 --> 12:31.633
Let's go.

12:33.537 --> 12:34.836
Ah-ah.

12:48.085 --> 12:50.086
Open it up.

12:55.959 --> 12:58.394
Go ahead.

13:24.889 --> 13:26.890
Very good. Thank you.

13:30.662 --> 13:32.929
Mr Hodges.

13:32.997 --> 13:34.431
Madam president.

13:34.499 --> 13:36.733
This is Greg Seaton,

13:36.801 --> 13:38.968
My associate.

13:39.036 --> 13:40.030
He's a remarkable man.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.432
Doesn't look remarkable,

13:41.472 --> 13:42.800
But believe me, he's a genius.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.609
Yes, I know Mr Seaton.

13:47.178 --> 13:49.045
Thank you, gentlemen.

13:51.015 --> 13:53.016
It never gets old, does it?

13:54.585 --> 13:57.153
Stepping into the… the oval office.

13:57.221 --> 13:58.188
Almost

13:58.255 --> 14:00.156
Smells of history.

14:00.224 --> 14:01.191
Can we sit?

14:01.258 --> 14:03.226
Please.

14:03.294 --> 14:05.495
You know, this is the first time

14:05.563 --> 14:07.558
I've been in this room since you were elected?

14:07.598 --> 14:08.959
I'm aware of that, yes.

14:08.999 --> 14:10.060
Under your predecessor,

14:10.100 --> 14:13.470
I used to drop by every couple of months.

14:13.538 --> 14:15.639
I'd brief president Daniels

14:15.707 --> 14:18.809
On what was really going on in the world.

14:18.876 --> 14:21.311
And you've been excluded now.

14:21.379 --> 14:23.513
Is that what this is about?

14:23.581 --> 14:25.349
No, ma'am.

14:25.416 --> 14:27.330
It's about allowing Starkwood

14:28.853 --> 14:30.821
Protecting this country.

14:30.888 --> 14:32.350
You have been attacking

14:32.390 --> 14:33.557
This country.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.225
You and general Juma

14:35.292 --> 14:38.228
Have killed hundreds of innocent people,

14:38.295 --> 14:40.296
Including my son.

14:42.233 --> 14:45.168
Madam president,

14:45.236 --> 14:47.198
I'm deeply sorry for your loss,

14:47.238 --> 14:48.972
And my heart breaks

14:49.039 --> 14:50.668
For all the lives that were taken today,

14:50.708 --> 14:51.808
But I'm shocked

14:51.876 --> 14:53.338
That you would think that I had anything

14:53.378 --> 14:55.139
To do with it. We have evidence

14:55.179 --> 14:57.174
That you've been working with Juma.

14:57.214 --> 15:00.751
Your intelligence agencies have failed you.

15:00.818 --> 15:02.647
If I had known what Juma was up to,

15:02.687 --> 15:03.681
I would have done

15:03.721 --> 15:05.450
Everything in my power to stop him.

15:05.490 --> 15:08.825
So let's push aside all
these baseless accusations

15:08.893 --> 15:10.855
And maybe we can do some business here.

15:10.895 --> 15:12.896
I'm listening.

15:14.932 --> 15:16.867
Madam president,

15:16.934 --> 15:18.896
I know you're a student of history,

15:18.936 --> 15:20.365
And so you're well aware

15:20.405 --> 15:22.367
That our nation's independence was won

15:22.407 --> 15:23.601
With the aid of private armies,

15:23.641 --> 15:26.743
And we can't survive without them.

15:26.811 --> 15:29.139
Look how easy it was to get
bio-weapons into this country.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.742
Our defenses are fragile.

15:30.782 --> 15:32.643
They're on the verge of collapse.

15:32.683 --> 15:35.713
But it's not too late to do something about it.

15:35.753 --> 15:37.888
So what are you suggesting?

15:37.955 --> 15:39.890
In short,

15:39.957 --> 15:41.858
I want a seat at the table.

15:41.926 --> 15:44.896
Starkwood needs to be involved in the shaping

15:44.962 --> 15:47.898
Of military policy, domestic and global.

15:47.965 --> 15:50.066
It sounds more like

15:50.134 --> 15:52.263
You want a seat at the head of the table.

15:52.303 --> 15:55.433
Madam president, I'm not here
to supplant your authority.

15:55.473 --> 15:57.468
What I'm proposing is a partnership.

15:57.508 --> 15:59.576
Think of Starkwood

15:59.644 --> 16:01.672
As the fifth branch of the military.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.713
Greg?

16:05.983 --> 16:07.578
This contains the protocols

16:07.618 --> 16:10.654
That will serve as the basis of our agreement.

16:11.456 --> 16:13.418
I suggest that we review them together.

16:13.458 --> 16:16.392
Jonas, I agreed to this meeting

16:16.461 --> 16:19.356
Because I wanted to hear what you had to say.

16:19.396 --> 16:22.165
But what you're proposing is blackmail.

16:22.232 --> 16:25.129
Well, that's putting it in
the worst possible light.

16:25.169 --> 16:28.638
You are threatening to kill thousands of people.

16:30.675 --> 16:33.977
I'm not proud of this chapter.

16:34.044 --> 16:36.746
I'm the first to admit it.

16:36.814 --> 16:38.008
And it's time to turn the page.

16:38.048 --> 16:40.010
This country has seen enough bloodshed today.

16:40.050 --> 16:43.013
For the sake of the American
people, madam president,

16:43.053 --> 16:45.455
I implore you to work with me,

16:45.523 --> 16:47.991
And let's move past this.

16:55.533 --> 16:58.201
Pick up the document, madam president.

17:21.726 --> 17:23.059
Let's go.

17:23.127 --> 17:25.222
Come on. Get up now, or I'll leave you down here.

17:25.262 --> 17:26.723
And you don't want that believe me. Get up!

17:26.763 --> 17:28.064
Let's go!

17:57.995 --> 18:00.697
?

18:12.777 --> 18:13.877
Come on!

18:21.418 --> 18:22.953
What is it?

18:23.020 --> 18:24.320
Code 363.

18:24.388 --> 18:25.382
That's a government breach.

18:25.422 --> 18:26.651
We're supposed to launch.

18:26.691 --> 18:27.919
Are you sure it's not a false alarm?

18:27.959 --> 18:29.025
No way to tell.

18:29.093 --> 18:30.087
We've got standing

18:30.127 --> 18:31.227
Orders, though.

18:31.295 --> 18:33.407
Let's start the launch sequence.

18:39.704 --> 18:41.071
Too late.

18:51.716 --> 18:53.650
Launch sequence complete.

18:53.718 --> 18:55.284
Target is locked.

18:55.352 --> 18:56.681
Enter the firing codes.

18:56.721 --> 18:58.082
Sir, we need to confirm this.

18:58.122 --> 19:00.017
That's not the correct protocol.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.518
We're about to kill 10,000 people.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.520
We should get someone on the phone.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.095
Enter the codes.

19:05.162 --> 19:06.129
Now!

19:06.196 --> 19:07.831
No, sir.

19:44.535 --> 19:46.497
That's it. That's us. Let's go.

19:46.537 --> 19:47.637
We're a go!

19:47.705 --> 19:49.539
We're a go!

20:01.251 --> 20:02.552
Tony?

20:02.619 --> 20:04.788
Tony, do you copy?

20:04.855 --> 20:05.964
An explosion of that magnitude

20:06.004 --> 20:07.190
would have short

20:07.257 --> 20:11.085
We're gonna have to wait for
Larry and his men to move in.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.202
It says here that you want

20:19.269 --> 20:22.099
Active status in the Pentagon's
strategic planning group.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.573
That's correct.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.468
That would give you access to
level 6 classified material.

20:27.511 --> 20:29.273
Not even the vice president has that clearance.

20:29.313 --> 20:32.816
These points are nonnegotiable.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.645
I'm not here to debate them.

20:34.685 --> 20:36.080
Let's review the next section,

20:36.120 --> 20:37.741
Which concerns senate oversight

20:37.781 --> 20:39.761
of Starkwood field operations.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.853
I'm sorry to interrupt,
madam president, but I need

20:42.893 --> 20:43.854
To speak with you.

20:43.894 --> 20:44.961
Can it wait?

20:45.029 --> 20:46.930
No, ma'am, it can't.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.458
Will you excuse me for a moment?

20:48.498 --> 20:50.499
Of course.

21:01.311 --> 21:02.740
Satcom has just detected

21:02.780 --> 21:04.775
A massive explosion on the Starkwood compound.

21:04.815 --> 21:05.776
The bio-weapons facility

21:05.816 --> 21:06.877
Has been destroyed.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.045
Are you sure? Yes, ma'am.

21:08.085 --> 21:09.379
Judging by the size of the explosion,

21:09.419 --> 21:10.414
Nothing could have survived.

21:10.454 --> 21:11.949
But I don't know how this happened.

21:11.989 --> 21:13.223
This wasn't us.

21:13.290 --> 21:14.919
Call FBI and have them lock down Starkwood.

21:14.959 --> 21:17.071
They're already moving in. Good.

21:17.128 --> 21:20.696
And when this is over, I want
to speak to Jack Bauer.

21:20.765 --> 21:21.798
Yes, ma'am.

21:21.866 --> 21:24.167
You know…

21:26.203 --> 21:27.965
I'm not sure I'm reaching her.

21:28.005 --> 21:29.133
I think you handled it

21:29.173 --> 21:30.740
Perfectly, sir.

21:30.808 --> 21:33.476
We'll see.

21:36.213 --> 21:37.713
What the hell is this?

21:37.782 --> 21:40.477
Put this document into
evidence, and take these men

21:40.517 --> 21:41.818
Into custody.

21:41.886 --> 21:43.280
What are you thinking? Have you lost

21:43.320 --> 21:44.453
your mind?

21:44.521 --> 21:45.950
Jonas, we've taken out your missiles.

21:45.990 --> 21:48.091
It's over.

21:49.493 --> 21:50.681
That's impossible.

21:50.694 --> 21:53.129
It's the truth.

21:53.197 --> 21:56.065
And you're under arrest.

21:56.133 --> 21:57.762
You are a terrorist and a murderer,

21:57.802 --> 22:00.464
And I'm gonna do everything
in my power to make sure

22:00.504 --> 22:02.880
That you pay dearly for your crimes.

22:04.308 --> 22:07.510
My only crime is that I'm trying to protect

22:07.577 --> 22:08.845
My country!

22:08.913 --> 22:11.647
You think this ends with me?

22:11.715 --> 22:13.878
I'm just a small cog in a very big machine.

22:13.918 --> 22:15.051
Hold on.

22:18.088 --> 22:20.517
You can't even begin to imagine
what you're up against.

22:20.557 --> 22:23.059
What are you talking about?

22:24.929 --> 22:27.230
You'll find out.

22:31.068 --> 22:33.803
Get him out of here.

23:03.503 --> 23:04.463
The advanced bio-hazard team
is reporting

23:04.503 --> 23:05.963
No trace of the bio-weapon anywhere

23:06.003 --> 23:06.964
Near the blast sight.

23:07.004 --> 23:08.232
It was incinerated in the explosion.

23:08.272 --> 23:09.372
Good.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.768
Any word on Tony? Not yet.

23:10.808 --> 23:11.935
Larry's searching the compound now.

23:11.975 --> 23:13.237
We should hear something soon.

23:13.277 --> 23:14.344
Mr Bauer,

23:14.412 --> 23:16.474
You have a phone call; it's the president.

23:16.514 --> 23:18.976
I'll take it in the conference room. Thank you.

23:19.016 --> 23:20.483
I'll be right back.

23:31.995 --> 23:33.051
Madam president.

23:33.097 --> 23:35.098
Mr Bauer, Jonas Hodges is

23:35.165 --> 23:37.234
Under arrest.

23:37.301 --> 23:38.435
That's good news.

23:38.502 --> 23:39.703
That's very good.

23:39.770 --> 23:44.140
Jack, you and your team
provided me with an option.

23:44.208 --> 23:47.043
And for that, I am deeply grateful.

23:47.111 --> 23:49.546
And so are the American people.

23:49.614 --> 23:51.990
Madam president, it was Tony Almeida

23:52.049 --> 23:54.579
Who risked his life to destroy those missiles.

23:54.619 --> 23:55.913
And as you know, he's facing arrest

23:55.953 --> 23:57.481
For things he did leading up to today,

23:57.521 --> 23:59.149
And I was hoping that maybe

23:59.189 --> 24:01.625
You could…

24:01.692 --> 24:03.526
Yes, Mr Bauer?

24:08.299 --> 24:10.066
Jack?

24:12.102 --> 24:13.536
Um, I'm sorry, I…

24:13.604 --> 24:16.172
Completely forgot what I was saying.

24:16.240 --> 24:19.008
You were talking about Mr Almeida.

24:19.076 --> 24:20.454
And my answer is yes, I-I will

24:20.494 --> 24:21.939
take his action condition.

24:21.979 --> 24:24.914
Thank you.

24:26.950 --> 24:28.752
What's happening?

24:28.819 --> 24:31.988
I-I-I'm not exactly sure.

24:32.055 --> 24:35.158
Jack, I am so sorry
you're going through this.

24:35.225 --> 24:37.521
I wish that there were something I could do.

24:37.561 --> 24:40.424
M-madam president, I appreciate this phone call.

24:40.464 --> 24:43.166
But I'm sorry. I-I have to go.

24:43.233 --> 24:44.167
Of course.

24:44.234 --> 24:45.268
Thank you.

24:52.943 --> 24:53.876
Jonas Hodges

24:53.944 --> 24:54.972
Has been arrested.

24:55.012 --> 24:55.945
Let me know

24:56.013 --> 24:57.375
As soon as you got Tony.

24:57.415 --> 24:59.131
I need to go see Dr macer.

25:01.151 --> 25:02.852
Yes, madam president?

25:02.920 --> 25:05.288
Call Ben Landry at CDC.

25:05.356 --> 25:07.890
Tell him that I want real-time updates

25:07.958 --> 25:08.919
On Jack Bauer's condition.

25:08.959 --> 25:09.959
Yes, ma'am.

25:22.172 --> 25:24.435
We've secured all entry points and command posts

25:24.475 --> 25:27.438
And are sweeping the compound
on a grid-by-grid basis.

25:27.478 --> 25:28.606
Are you meeting any resistance?

25:28.646 --> 25:30.213
No.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.476
They're surrendering peacefully and cooperating.

25:32.516 --> 25:34.617
Most of the men on this base,

25:34.685 --> 25:37.415
I don't think they had any
idea what was going on.

25:37.455 --> 25:39.055
What about Almeida?

25:39.122 --> 25:40.623
Uh, he's here.

25:40.691 --> 25:41.624
We found him.

25:41.692 --> 25:43.321
Is he okay? Some cuts and bruises,

25:43.361 --> 25:45.189
But otherwise, he's in pretty good shape.

25:45.229 --> 25:46.363
Good. Good.

25:46.430 --> 25:47.858
Jack will be glad to hear that.

25:47.898 --> 25:50.132
Listen, Renée…

25:50.200 --> 25:52.262
We've known each other a long time, you know.

25:52.302 --> 25:53.798
Um, so much stuff has happened today.

25:53.838 --> 25:55.572
Yeah.

25:55.639 --> 25:57.100
We have a lot to talk about.

25:57.140 --> 25:59.876
I know.

25:59.943 --> 26:00.971
Excuse me, agent Walker.
She's in the waiting area.

26:01.011 --> 26:02.812
Okay, thank you.

26:02.880 --> 26:03.974
Larry, I've got to go.

26:04.014 --> 26:05.042
Kim Bauer's here.
Jack's daughter?

26:05.082 --> 26:06.744
Yes. I-I asked her to come.

26:06.784 --> 26:09.218
There's this experimental treatment

26:09.286 --> 26:11.248
For Jack's disease, but he
needs compatible stem cells.

26:11.288 --> 26:13.584
It's a long shot, but it's
the only hope he's got.

26:13.624 --> 26:15.859
Okay.

26:15.926 --> 26:17.555
Let me know how it goes, all right?

26:17.595 --> 26:19.311
I will. I'm going off com.

26:19.329 --> 26:21.898
All right.

26:23.734 --> 26:25.195
Did they say something about Kim Bauer?

26:25.235 --> 26:28.004
Yeah, she's at FBI

26:28.071 --> 26:29.433
Helping with a treatment for Jack,

26:29.473 --> 26:31.268
Some, uh, some kind of stem cell therapy.

26:31.308 --> 26:33.504
So they think he's gonna be all right?

26:33.544 --> 26:35.912
Didn't sound promising.

26:38.582 --> 26:41.078
Listen, Tony, he's
This isn't easy for me,

26:41.118 --> 26:43.986
But, uh… I'm under orders

26:44.054 --> 26:45.383
To take you into federal custody.

26:45.423 --> 26:47.290
Yeah, I know.

26:47.357 --> 26:48.686
You did a brave thing here.

26:48.726 --> 26:50.888
Probably saved thousands of lives.

26:50.928 --> 26:52.829
For the record,

26:52.897 --> 26:55.025
I don't think this is how you should be repaid.

26:55.065 --> 26:57.266
I appreciate that, but, uh…

26:59.269 --> 27:01.098
I'm ready to pay for what I've done.

27:01.138 --> 27:03.250
Get the cuffs off him, will you?

27:05.008 --> 27:06.136
Choppers on the way.

27:06.176 --> 27:08.948
I'll be taking you back to FBI, all right?

27:11.014 --> 27:13.950
Memory loss is consistent with the disease,

27:14.017 --> 27:14.951
Mr Bauer.

27:15.018 --> 27:16.113
I just wouldn't have expected it

27:16.153 --> 27:18.020
To manifest this quickly.

27:18.088 --> 27:20.857
It's not just memory loss.

27:20.925 --> 27:22.926
It feels like…

27:26.363 --> 27:28.937
I don't know exactly how to explain it.

27:28.999 --> 27:31.233
I feel like, uh,

27:31.301 --> 27:33.631
Like I'm losing some part of myself.

27:33.671 --> 27:35.638
The disease profile includes

27:35.706 --> 27:39.275
Personality changes, sometimes
even hallucinations.

27:39.343 --> 27:41.104
But this is a weaponized pathogen

27:41.144 --> 27:42.339
We don't know much about.

27:42.379 --> 27:45.242
Military's still combing through the remains

27:45.282 --> 27:46.777
Of the bio-weapons lab in Sangala,

27:46.817 --> 27:48.479
So we expect to learn something

27:48.519 --> 27:49.486
Very soon.

27:49.553 --> 27:50.815
You were able to give me something

27:50.855 --> 27:52.703
That controlled the shaking.

27:53.691 --> 27:54.885
Is there anything that you can give me

27:54.925 --> 27:55.920
That would help me with this?

27:55.960 --> 27:57.460
No.

27:57.528 --> 27:59.228
I'm sorry.

28:01.231 --> 28:02.932
Okay.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.567
Thank you. Excuse me.

28:16.914 --> 28:20.349
Jack, is it all right?

28:20.417 --> 28:21.684
Yeah, um,

28:21.752 --> 28:24.014
I'm gonna need to go on record about everything

28:24.054 --> 28:25.015
That happened today.

28:25.055 --> 28:26.283
And we need to do it soon.

28:26.323 --> 28:28.118
I'm not sure how much longer I'm gonna be

28:28.158 --> 28:29.553
Able to provide you with the details.

28:29.593 --> 28:31.193
Okay.

28:31.261 --> 28:33.023
First, there's something that you need to know.

28:33.063 --> 28:34.597
What?

28:34.665 --> 28:36.499
It's about Kim.

28:36.567 --> 28:38.001
She's here, Jack.

28:38.068 --> 28:39.530
I told her that you were sick

28:39.570 --> 28:41.198
And that she might be able to help

28:41.238 --> 28:43.372
With the treatment.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.441
You did…

28:47.444 --> 28:49.378
You did what?

28:49.446 --> 28:50.379
Come here.

28:50.447 --> 28:52.448
Come here.

28:55.586 --> 28:56.886
Who the hell

28:56.954 --> 28:58.181
Do you think you are?

28:58.221 --> 28:59.155
Who the hell

28:59.222 --> 29:00.890
Do you think you are?

29:02.192 --> 29:04.393
You think this is easy?

29:04.461 --> 29:06.423
You think you understand what I'm going through?

29:06.463 --> 29:07.491
Because you don't.

29:07.531 --> 29:08.464
I am dying.

29:08.532 --> 29:10.900
And I was okay with it.

29:10.968 --> 29:13.502
I could handle it.

29:13.571 --> 29:16.634
And now you've put in front of me the one thing,

29:16.674 --> 29:19.202
The one thing that is gonna make this unbearable.

29:19.242 --> 29:21.171
Jack, listen… no, you listen to me.

29:21.211 --> 29:24.374
I specifically told you do not
drag my daughter into this.

29:24.414 --> 29:26.983
No one dragged her into anything.

29:27.051 --> 29:29.493
She's been trying to see you all day.

29:35.292 --> 29:36.425
What?

29:36.493 --> 29:39.729
She was at the senate hearing this morning.

29:39.797 --> 29:42.398
She flew out from I.a To be there,

29:42.466 --> 29:44.428
But we pulled you out before she could see you.

29:44.468 --> 29:46.363
She's been leaving messages
at our office all day.

29:46.403 --> 29:48.779
They just didn't get to me till now.

29:51.475 --> 29:54.572
If you want, I can tell her that you're not here.

29:54.612 --> 29:57.614
I can tell her that you can't see her.

30:00.718 --> 30:03.086
Can't do that.

30:06.757 --> 30:08.524
Where is she?

30:08.592 --> 30:10.392
Down the hall.

30:12.429 --> 30:14.396
Show me.

30:45.459 --> 30:47.460
Daddy.

30:50.798 --> 30:53.132
How are you feeling?

30:54.167 --> 30:56.535
I'm-I'm okay.

30:56.604 --> 30:59.072
You're not in any pain?

30:59.139 --> 31:00.873
No.

31:02.342 --> 31:04.577
Come sit down.

31:18.859 --> 31:21.989
Did agent Walker tell you that
I was trying to find you?

31:22.029 --> 31:25.397
Yeah.

31:25.397 --> 31:27.028
I've tried everything to track you down:

31:27.068 --> 31:28.863
State department, private investigators.

31:28.903 --> 31:31.633
Every time I got a phone number or an address,

31:31.673 --> 31:33.607
You were already gone.

31:33.675 --> 31:35.309
I'm sorry.

31:35.377 --> 31:37.939
I thought I was doing the best thing for you

31:37.979 --> 31:39.380
By staying away.

31:42.217 --> 31:45.018
Daddy, I've missed you so much.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.590
I've missed you,

31:49.658 --> 31:51.659
Too.

31:52.927 --> 31:55.095
You need to know how sorry I am

31:55.163 --> 31:56.525
For everything that you've had

31:56.565 --> 31:57.965
to live through

31:58.032 --> 31:59.467
No, don't do that.

31:59.534 --> 32:00.796
Don't put that on yourself.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.364
I'm the one that should apologize.

32:02.404 --> 32:03.671
I pushed you away.

32:03.739 --> 32:05.600
And instead of taking responsibility

32:05.640 --> 32:09.777
For all the mistakes I've made
in my life, I blamed you.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.145
And it was stupid

32:12.213 --> 32:14.214
And immature.

32:15.751 --> 32:19.052
And now, all the time that we've lost…

32:23.191 --> 32:25.654
Agent Walker told me that there's a chance—

32:25.694 --> 32:28.996
A small chance— that I could help you,

32:29.063 --> 32:30.713
And you don't want me to.

32:30.766 --> 32:32.746
The treatment is experimental.

32:33.268 --> 32:35.330
And I don't think it's going to work.

32:35.370 --> 32:38.500
And you don't want to because
you're afraid to ask me.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.541
No.

32:41.743 --> 32:43.677
There's a risk to you.

32:43.745 --> 32:46.213
A small risk…

32:46.281 --> 32:48.148
Worth taking.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.283
Not to me.

32:50.985 --> 32:54.121
Kim… I'm dying.

32:55.356 --> 32:57.118
And whatever small chance there is

32:57.158 --> 32:59.259
To stop that from happening—

32:59.327 --> 33:03.564
It is not worth the pain for me to let you

33:03.632 --> 33:05.126
Sit there and watch me die.

33:05.166 --> 33:07.568
Daddy, I don't want to lose you.

33:07.636 --> 33:09.737
Come here.

33:09.805 --> 33:11.104
Come on. I don't.

33:12.340 --> 33:14.669
Sweetheart, it's going to be all right.

33:14.709 --> 33:17.283
It's gonna be all right. I promise you.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.084
What is it?

33:26.154 --> 33:28.789
What?

33:31.125 --> 33:33.293
Sweetheart, I'm sorry…

33:33.361 --> 33:36.564
But you need to go.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.775
Please, baby, please, I'm begging you.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.371
I love you so much.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.881
Honey, I love you, too. Please, baby.

33:48.242 --> 33:50.243
Thank you. Go.

34:33.554 --> 34:36.590
Auxiliary gate 6 is clear.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.426
Copy that, P-2. Hold your position.

34:48.770 --> 34:50.170
Freeze!

34:50.237 --> 34:51.492
Show me your hands.

34:51.505 --> 34:52.672
Get 'em up!

35:03.484 --> 35:04.652
P-2 to dispatch.

35:04.719 --> 35:07.281
I have an agent down and a suspect in custody.

35:07.321 --> 35:08.422
Code red.

35:08.489 --> 35:09.890
Copy that, P-2.

35:09.958 --> 35:11.953
All available agents respond to auxiliary gate 6.

35:11.993 --> 35:13.493
Code red.

35:18.900 --> 35:20.901
Hands on the hood.

35:38.653 --> 35:41.689
P-2 to dispatch.

35:41.756 --> 35:44.528
Put me through to agent Moss. It's urgent.

35:47.495 --> 35:49.162
Agent Moss.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.626
Agent Moss, this is Davis
at auxiliary gate 6.

35:51.666 --> 35:53.461
I have a Starkwood op in custody.

35:53.501 --> 35:55.030
He killed one of our agents.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.798
He was carrying a canister of the bio-weapon,

35:56.838 --> 35:57.899
Trying to smuggle it out

35:57.939 --> 35:59.067
Using one of our vehicles.

35:59.107 --> 36:00.941
What⁈ are you sure?

36:01.009 --> 36:02.876
I'm looking at it right now.

36:05.747 --> 36:08.548
Agent Davis?

36:08.617 --> 36:10.417
Davis⁈

36:15.657 --> 36:17.357
Walker.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.688
Renée, we got a breach
in the cordon at gate 6.

36:19.728 --> 36:20.855
One of the Starkwood ops—

36:20.895 --> 36:22.323
He's got a canister of the bio-weapon.

36:22.363 --> 36:23.463
What?

36:23.531 --> 36:24.826
It was ID'd by agent Davis,

36:24.866 --> 36:26.394
Who I believe has just been shot.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.396
The suspect may be fleeing in an FBI vehicle,

36:28.436 --> 36:30.632
So I need you to close down all access roads,

36:30.672 --> 36:32.233
And alert perimeter units and metro police.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.501
Janis, get me DC metro.

36:33.541 --> 36:35.003
I'm gonna pursue it from the air.

36:35.043 --> 36:37.144
Let's go! Let us up!

36:38.747 --> 36:40.047
Renée,

36:40.115 --> 36:41.977
Alert homeland, let them know what's going on.

36:42.017 --> 36:43.912
Are we thinking this is another attack, Larry?

36:43.952 --> 36:45.780
I don't know, but there's enough prion variant

36:45.820 --> 36:49.186
In one of those canisters
to take out a small city.

37:10.644 --> 37:12.606
Agent miller, are there any major roadways

37:12.646 --> 37:14.976
In our perimeter that Starkwood
operatives could have used?

37:15.016 --> 37:16.116
Yes, sir.

37:16.184 --> 37:17.444
We're coming up on highway 42.

37:17.484 --> 37:18.780
Should I turn us that way?

37:18.820 --> 37:19.942
Yes, until we get

37:19.987 --> 37:21.883
A stronger directive from agent Walker.

37:21.923 --> 37:23.824
Roger that.

37:23.891 --> 37:26.154
Yes, sir. We'll keep homeland apprised

37:26.194 --> 37:27.828
With real-time updates.

37:27.895 --> 37:29.691
Did you access the GPS locator system?

37:29.731 --> 37:31.664
Yeah, I'm scanning

37:31.733 --> 37:33.828
Transponders for the stolen FBI vehicle.

37:33.868 --> 37:35.029
How long will that take?

37:35.069 --> 37:36.998
As long as it takes for the
satellite to reposition.

37:37.038 --> 37:40.006
When you spoke to Larry, you mentioned

37:40.074 --> 37:41.341
An attack?

37:41.408 --> 37:42.670
The Starkwood operative

37:42.710 --> 37:44.505
We're trying to find stole a canister

37:44.545 --> 37:46.046
Of the bio-weapon.

37:46.114 --> 37:48.176
I thought Tony Almeida destroyed all the weapons.

37:48.216 --> 37:49.315
Apparently not.

37:49.383 --> 37:51.312
How did this operative get past our perimeter?

37:51.352 --> 37:53.854
Shot and killed two of our agents.

37:53.921 --> 37:56.256
This is it.

37:56.323 --> 38:00.151
The suspect is getting off
highway 42 at Smoketree avenue.

38:01.796 --> 38:03.557
Put me on the interagency channel.

38:03.597 --> 38:05.259
Go ahead. All units, this is

38:05.299 --> 38:06.460
Agent Walker with FBI.

38:06.500 --> 38:09.469
Suspect has exited highway 42 at Smoketree.

38:09.536 --> 38:11.099
He's heading north into the industrial corridor.

38:11.139 --> 38:12.666
Units in the vicinity, please respond.

38:12.706 --> 38:13.807
Renée, it's me.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.169
We're over Smoketree right now.

38:15.209 --> 38:16.938
We're redirecting, and we'll tighten our pursuit.

38:16.978 --> 38:20.278
Got it. I'll reroute swat
team alpha to the scene.

38:20.782 --> 38:22.009
Swat team alpha, we need

38:22.049 --> 38:23.044
To set up a roadblock

38:23.084 --> 38:24.511
At the Fairfax county line.

38:24.551 --> 38:26.513
DC metro's covering the
district line in case he tries

38:26.553 --> 38:28.554
To double back.

38:34.128 --> 38:35.662
Sir.

38:35.729 --> 38:37.730
I have a visual.

38:37.799 --> 38:39.966
Yeah. Got him.

38:46.274 --> 38:48.041
Send us lower.

38:55.183 --> 38:58.813
Yeah, he's pulling off the
road. Get us down there now.

39:01.289 --> 39:02.483
Renée, it's Larry. Suspect is on foot.

39:02.523 --> 39:03.818
We can't wait for backup.

39:03.858 --> 39:05.119
We're moving in right now.

39:05.159 --> 39:06.954
All right. SWAT team's a few minutes out.

39:06.994 --> 39:08.895
Careful, Larry. Yeah.

39:08.963 --> 39:12.132
Remember, suspect has a canister,

39:12.200 --> 39:13.327
So pick your shots.

39:13.367 --> 39:14.762
If possible, let's take him alive.

39:14.802 --> 39:16.002
Yes, sir.

39:22.676 --> 39:24.305
We got to get out of here.

39:24.345 --> 39:25.673
Almeida, cover. Let's go.

39:25.713 --> 39:27.714
Come on!

39:56.210 --> 39:57.911
Sir, relax.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.679
Relax.

39:59.747 --> 40:01.114
I'm okay. Relax.

40:05.753 --> 40:07.453
Swallow. Tony.

40:08.722 --> 40:09.856
Tony!

40:09.924 --> 40:12.525
Tony!

40:18.933 --> 40:21.768
What…?

40:21.835 --> 40:24.670
I'm sorry, Larry.

40:24.738 --> 40:26.873
Oh… God…

40:26.941 --> 40:28.508
Oh!

41:16.557 --> 41:18.391
Let me see it.

41:39.013 --> 41:40.780
Man oveis location.

41:40.848 --> 41:43.158
How the hell do we get out of here?

41:43.217 --> 41:46.113
I want you to take this, find a place to hide.

41:46.153 --> 41:47.915
Wait for my call. What about you?

41:47.955 --> 41:49.350
I'm gonna wait on the FBI,

41:49.390 --> 41:51.718
Figure out a way to get you out of here.

41:51.758 --> 41:52.925
Go!

41:53.305 --> 41:59.945
