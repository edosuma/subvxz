WEBVTT

00:06.007 --> 00:09.340
[Punching, kicking]

00:10.553 --> 00:13.670
Every kick from
your boot is bliss.

00:13.931 --> 00:17.048
Speaking of kinky, I'm
gonna need your chi.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.151
Why isn't this working?

00:31.157 --> 00:33.068
Probably my fault.

00:33.326 --> 00:36.033
Tell me where you're
keeping the wolf!

00:41.542 --> 00:44.784
I swear, Tamsin, I'll kill
you if you don't wake up.

00:45.046 --> 00:46.161
Come on.

00:47.506 --> 00:51.374
Dyson. I could really use
your help to rescue you.

00:51.636 --> 00:53.592
Here's hoping you're okay.

00:56.766 --> 01:00.850
Aifa, look at me. There
must be a way out of here.

01:04.649 --> 01:09.484
It's called death.
And it's coming for you.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.295
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

01:30.549 --> 01:33.165
It's harder when you don't
know what you are.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.214
My love carries a
death sentence.

01:36.472 --> 01:38.383
l was lost for years.

01:38.641 --> 01:41.257
Searching while hiding.

01:41.519 --> 01:45.387
Only to find I belong to a
world hidden from humans.

01:45.648 --> 01:47.013
I won't hide anymore.

01:47.275 --> 01:50.267
I will live the life I choose.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.440
It's critical that we re-boot
Tamsin immediately,

01:58.703 --> 01:59.943
so that we can rescue Dyson.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.284
Any questions?

02:01.539 --> 02:04.076
Yeah, do you have a
non-Ibiza party mix?

02:04.333 --> 02:05.789
I'm so over that scene.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.328
Get dumped by
one Spanish prince,

02:07.586 --> 02:09.668
and no more island
raves for any of us.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.207
Screw you, Amanda.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.171
I'd rather keep
screwing Fernando.

02:13.426 --> 02:13.960
What!

02:14.218 --> 02:15.799
To avenge you sweetie.

02:16.053 --> 02:16.712
Slut.

02:16.971 --> 02:17.801
Whore.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.011
God you're hot.

02:20.266 --> 02:22.803
Stop, just stop!

02:23.060 --> 02:25.676
Before I yank out every
kitsune hair on your head!

02:25.938 --> 02:26.097
Bitch.

02:26.355 --> 02:29.347
Amanda, Kasey, please.
Just focus.

02:29.608 --> 02:32.520
Poor Tam Tam.
Such a fugly sleeper.

02:32.778 --> 02:33.767
She's not sleeping.
She's dying.

02:34.030 --> 02:34.769
Well, she's been shot.

02:35.031 --> 02:36.487
Nothing to do with
the bullet, babes.

02:36.741 --> 02:39.904
Unaligned and un-believably
duh, am I right?

02:40.161 --> 02:42.777
Tamsin's clearly at the
end of her life cycle.

02:43.039 --> 02:44.995
Lookie.

02:49.045 --> 02:51.627
She is...

02:54.050 --> 02:55.586
she's dying.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.799
--A|so split ends.
--Ew.

02:58.054 --> 02:59.590
There must be something
we can do to stop it.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.548
To live, to serve...
to expire.

03:03.809 --> 03:04.924
Over and over again.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.393
Besides, death's
gonna be a sweet out,

03:07.646 --> 03:10.103
considering who Tamsin's
gotten involved with.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.940
A bad guy.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.775
Like, Voldemort bad.

03:15.029 --> 03:15.779
And old.

03:16.030 --> 03:16.519
Old as time.

03:16.781 --> 03:17.941
Well who is he?

03:18.199 --> 03:20.861
--I don't know his name.
--Don't wanna know.

03:22.828 --> 03:25.740
The least we can do is take this
bullet out. I'll scrub in.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.283
You're a doctor?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.748
No, but I've been
pre-med for 20 years.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.208
I love college.

03:31.462 --> 03:32.212
|'|| prep the patient.

03:32.463 --> 03:33.919
Do we have time
for a makeover?

03:34.173 --> 03:36.414
It's a horizontal
laceration, Kasey.

03:36.675 --> 03:39.758
Of course we do!

03:40.012 --> 03:41.593
Ginger Bitches.

03:44.517 --> 03:46.473
What a shitstorm
of Fae proportions.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.428
Kenzi, oh my god.
Are you all right?

03:51.690 --> 03:53.146
Yeah, just keeping it realsies

03:53.401 --> 03:54.766
with my peeps in Tent City.

03:55.027 --> 03:55.857
You're in the sewers?

03:56.112 --> 03:57.852
Please tell me
you've found Dyson.

03:58.114 --> 03:59.979
Found, yes.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.072
Rescued?
Still working on it.

04:02.326 --> 04:03.782
But, are you sure
you're okay?

04:04.036 --> 04:04.786
Totally.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.743
Just had to evac the Dal.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.953
The Morrigan finally shifted
into total psycho drive.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.166
And wow-- has she
ever gotten chubs.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.126
Pizza's here, battery dying,
love you, bye.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.711
Wait, Kenzi don't--

04:17.007 --> 04:18.747
Speaking of dying.

04:24.473 --> 04:27.010
Hi!

04:27.268 --> 04:27.882
I knew I was a goner,

04:28.144 --> 04:30.601
I didn't think l was gonna
wake up in slut heaven.

04:30.855 --> 04:33.847
O-M-G-G.
The extra G is for glitter.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.645
Amanda?
You're a freakin' genius.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.767
Stitchwork's not
bad either, Kasey.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.487
And the best part is, you
barely look like you're dying!

04:44.368 --> 04:46.950
What did you girls tell Bo?

04:48.038 --> 04:50.575
Ladies. Can we have a moment?

04:50.833 --> 04:52.949
Only if you don't mind us
rifling through your drawers.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.166
Slash trying on your underwear.

04:57.465 --> 04:58.295
Sorry about that.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.006
They'll be out of luck.
I don't wear underwear.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.966
Good to know.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.883
The girls set your pre-op
makeover to Pretty Woman.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.883
Before she met Richard Gere.

05:11.187 --> 05:11.926
What?!

05:12.188 --> 05:13.928
Not that I care how
you look as long

05:14.190 --> 05:17.182
as you're willing to help get
Dyson out of the compound.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.354
I saw ten guards, just
around the perimeter.

05:19.612 --> 05:22.149
What if we were able to
get most of them together.

05:22.406 --> 05:25.364
Could you cast doubt
over an entire room?

05:25.618 --> 05:30.203
Look, there was a time, I could
lay waste to an entire army.

05:30.456 --> 05:33.744
Now if I go full
Valkyrie I'll pass out.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.538
Sucks to get old.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.371
Yeah I bet.

05:40.633 --> 05:41.748
Sorry.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.126
You should be. You never
got to see me in my prime.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.675
I could settle a battle
with the blink of an eye.

05:48.933 --> 05:52.517
Before I got weak and started
slumming it as a mercenary.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.510
Fell in with the wrong guy?

05:56.232 --> 05:59.349
Or so the movie
version would go.

05:59.610 --> 06:02.852
If we're gonna battle royale for our
boy I'm gonna need to power up.

06:03.113 --> 06:06.480
There's this dealer,
Massimo. He can juice me.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.778
Druids are good like that.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.947
I've always wanted
to meet the Druid.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.947
This should be fun then.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.621
Now let me check my very
packed social calendar,

06:17.878 --> 06:21.712
uh, nope. Not scheduled to
take any of your guff.

06:21.966 --> 06:24.799
No matter how
chouette your shoes are.

06:25.052 --> 06:30.172
Thanks, I use them
to crush rodents.

06:30.432 --> 06:34.801
And just so you know,
I am not that afraid of death.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.474
Although open
to other alternatives.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.767
Your easy-to-snap
human body?

06:40.025 --> 06:41.890
What challenge
would that pose?

06:42.152 --> 06:44.985
I've seen better constructed
dorm room bookcases.

06:47.241 --> 06:51.905
l was thinking of someone
with genuine power.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.778
Someone the Light hold
dear to their hearts.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.371
Dyson .

06:56.625 --> 06:57.375
Lauren--!

06:57.626 --> 06:59.867
No, swizzle spine.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.869
I meant Trick.

07:02.131 --> 07:07.216
Your beloved
Blood King... is dead.

07:18.022 --> 07:20.934
Aifa. Please talk to me.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.318
Is my daughter okay?

07:23.569 --> 07:24.854
Bo is fine.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.774
She's my daughter, you see.
My daughter. Bo is my daughter.

07:28.032 --> 07:30.774
Bo is my daughter.

07:31.035 --> 07:35.950
J) Dark, light, wrong, right.
Skip to my loo darlin' J)

07:36.206 --> 07:38.743
1’ Skip to my loo. 1’

07:39.001 --> 07:41.413
Most couldn't handle the pain.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.831
But I could.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.704
lcan.

07:48.052 --> 07:50.008
What does he want?

07:53.223 --> 07:57.182
At first he wanted... me.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.482
He'd been watching me.
Tracking me.

08:02.733 --> 08:06.942
Thought me powerful,
the most powerful.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.027
Then he saw me
defeated, broken,

08:09.281 --> 08:11.363
after Bo and I fought.

08:11.617 --> 08:14.780
Still he picked me
up. Brought me here.

08:15.037 --> 08:18.529
Aifa. What did he do to you?

08:18.791 --> 08:21.658
Always with the quesitons.

08:21.919 --> 08:25.207
What's the ultimate
type of Fae, Succubus?

08:25.464 --> 08:27.420
Who's the strongest?

08:30.260 --> 08:33.502
But I never told them.

08:33.764 --> 08:40.351
I never told them it's
my Bo, my daughter.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.560
I told him it was you.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.853
I saw it in her
eyes, that night.

08:47.111 --> 08:49.898
you gave up your wolf,
to save her.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.113
Yes.

08:54.993 --> 09:00.738
I did too, gave up the
wolf to save my girl.

09:00.999 --> 09:07.040
Because we love her.
We love her.

09:12.845 --> 09:15.587
My husband was
bartending at the Dal.

09:15.848 --> 09:18.510
The things they
asked him to do...

09:18.767 --> 09:22.180
do you think he survived?

09:22.438 --> 09:25.771
Is this right?
Are you a Cabbit?

09:26.024 --> 09:28.401
Hence the
thirty-eight children.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.109
| only hope I live long
enough to see them again.

09:31.363 --> 09:34.321
I promise you, you will survive.

09:34.575 --> 09:37.362
It's not nice to make
promises you can't keep.

09:37.619 --> 09:41.111
And you know better than to
get attached to the lab rats.

09:41.373 --> 09:44.160
I know better than to take
advice from a sociopath.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.750
I've put you in here
Lauren for your own good.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.839
But now- We have so much to do.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.924
Surgical tools,
some antiseptic--

09:55.179 --> 09:56.669
and ten minutes, to save her.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.794
Those are your terms?

09:58.056 --> 09:59.557
Then I'm all yours.

10:05.022 --> 10:06.808
I'll see what
I can rustle up...

10:07.065 --> 10:08.930
Ten minutes, doctor!

10:09.193 --> 10:12.856
My my my, the
spider and the fly.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.569
But who is spinning the web?

10:14.823 --> 10:15.812
Massimo.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.359
Tamsin, darling.
You look like ass.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.951
And you, you
look good enough to eat.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.115
Where's my pick-me-up?

10:22.372 --> 10:23.498
It's my own personal mix.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.205
Should help inject
some hot pink

10:25.459 --> 10:27.666
back into those frosty
Scandinavian cheeks.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.410
Careful though. It's potent,

10:29.671 --> 10:31.582
and not for
recreational use.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.877
|'|| hold it,
just in case.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.296
Until we need you
at your strongest.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.510
It's good thinking.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.801
Sister solidarity,
can you dig it?

10:42.059 --> 10:44.846
I think I'll try Trick again.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.479
You're trembling.
Are you losing your edge?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.769
Last person who said
that lost their hand.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.983
But not by you.

10:56.698 --> 11:00.407
I'm sorry. I loved Acacia too.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.901
Love will get you killed.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.278
I'd love to linger,
watch this all go to hell

11:04.540 --> 11:07.031
but I've a date with
a cabin up north.

11:11.129 --> 11:11.959
Will it work?

11:12.214 --> 11:15.581
Measured it three times,
cut it once.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.799
He won't measure.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.473
Any luck?

11:25.727 --> 11:28.810
Sure, I mean,
I still have you.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.564
Let everybody go.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.778
Immediately.

11:44.663 --> 11:47.370
They took my little
brother, you see.

11:47.624 --> 11:51.287
We were camping,
in our treehouse.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.661
He got scared of the moans
that came over the wind.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.538
I told him it was crickets--
a loon, maybe.

11:56.800 --> 12:01.214
And in the morning,
he was gone.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.759
Well, his head was gone.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.429
They said it was me.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.888
That must have been
very, very hard for you.

12:13.150 --> 12:17.769
You mean being shipped off to
the asylum, or not knowing?

12:18.030 --> 12:23.275
Both, actually, but
I was determined.

12:24.745 --> 12:29.159
By 21, I'd figured it out.
It had to have been a Wendigo.

12:29.416 --> 12:34.956
They can be very
territorial, when provoked.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.795
We didn't provoke it.

12:38.050 --> 12:40.006
We didn't provoke anything.

12:44.973 --> 12:49.763
But I found one,
later on in my journeys.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.476
I'm not sure that it's the
one that killed William,

12:51.730 --> 12:54.142
but I made sure he suffered.

12:55.067 --> 12:58.855
Your brother would have
been very proud of you.

12:59.112 --> 13:05.278
I didn't find any real pleasure
in it, not at that point.

13:05.535 --> 13:09.403
I discovered a
whole race of Fae.

13:09.665 --> 13:11.826
A whole race of creatures,
evolved beyond our imagination.

13:12.084 --> 13:16.874
That's what this is about
Lauren. This is about evolution.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.462
The Fae will find you,

13:19.716 --> 13:21.672
and they will take
more than your head.

13:23.679 --> 13:29.265
Well, go tell them.
Go on, go, tell them.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.351
They already know that you're
AWOL, that you betrayed them.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.344
They won't take you back.

13:34.606 --> 13:37.564
You flee this compound, and
you flee your protection,

13:40.445 --> 13:42.356
How long have you
known I worked for them?

13:42.614 --> 13:45.481
Long enough to know you're the
only one that could help me.

13:45.742 --> 13:50.577
You're the only that can help
the human race, ascend. Lauren.

13:50.831 --> 13:51.786
You're insane.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.453
We both know
that's not true.

13:55.711 --> 14:00.796
Deep down in your heart you
understand me, and what I want.

14:01.049 --> 14:05.418
Listen, I brought you here, so
you can extract the stem cells

14:05.679 --> 14:08.341
from the strongest
Fae I could find,

14:08.598 --> 14:09.178
and implant them...

14:09.433 --> 14:10.468
...into you.

14:10.726 --> 14:11.761
Correct.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.226
A crossbreed.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.765
You want to become Fae.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.891
And I'm going to use
Dyson's DNA to do it.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.902
No, I can't do this.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.616
Don't pussy out on me now.

14:29.870 --> 14:30.950
It's gonna hurt.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.867
Stay strong and remember
we're doing this for Dyson.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.912
You! Stop right there.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.626
Don't hold back okay.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.838
Guys we are so glad you're
here, we are so lost.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.752
Take it easy Meryl Streep.

14:45.010 --> 14:45.874
Go big or go home.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.797
Could you please help us?

14:48.055 --> 14:50.592
Hey, do you guys know
where the mall is?

14:50.849 --> 14:53.966
Don't be fooled,
they're just like the others.

14:54.227 --> 14:54.761
What?

14:55.020 --> 14:55.884
Take them to the cells.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.226
Told you we'd get inside.

14:57.481 --> 14:59.847
Yeah all we had to do
was act like girls.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.814
Hi.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.986
What is this place?

15:09.868 --> 15:11.324
You're quite the comedienne.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.364
But not a terrorist.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.658
Those should-be-extinct Fae
elders in the banquet room

15:15.916 --> 15:18.498
might have bought your
hysterical anti-human rhetoric.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.582
But Bo won't.

15:19.836 --> 15:20.791
Bo's not here.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.252
And Trick's dead,

15:22.506 --> 15:25.122
and Dyson's probably
a shag carpet by now.

15:25.383 --> 15:28.875
Hale, then.
The motherflippin' Ash.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.718
Hale's gone, sweetie.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.463
Pissed his leather panties
while he begged for his life.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.808
Left you, like
the coward he is.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.098
Is this your endgame?

15:39.356 --> 15:42.519
Torture the human for
info on... what, exactly?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.812
l have some very
specific questions

15:45.070 --> 15:48.688
about the Sucuslut's lineage.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.814
You want to
talk about Bo?

15:51.076 --> 15:55.740
I've tried bribery, the
Mesmer, a parasite...

15:55.997 --> 15:58.409
You could try not
being such a bitch.

15:58.667 --> 16:02.501
It's like the French Revolution
all over again, am I right?

16:04.172 --> 16:07.289
So gratifying finding
pleasure in the little things.

16:07.551 --> 16:10.918
Like watching Channing
Tatum dancing, in 3D.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.135
Why don't we
start with that?

16:14.391 --> 16:14.971
Bo.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.762
What? Broke up with Lauren?
Can now supersuck a crowd?

16:18.019 --> 16:19.930
Enjoys online cat videos?

16:20.188 --> 16:22.053
You might as well just
tourture away hunny,

16:24.109 --> 16:28.523
Bo can feed, off multiple
chi-- at the same time?

16:31.408 --> 16:33.490
I doubt even Bo could
hoover deep enough

16:33.743 --> 16:35.699
to remove those crowsfeet!

16:40.333 --> 16:42.949
What the hell--
is this thing on?

16:43.211 --> 16:44.121
Ow!

16:44.379 --> 16:46.210
I don't have time
for these games.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.920
Perhaps the
sanctuary is warded.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.632
Or the Blood King cast some
heavy duty protection spells

16:50.886 --> 16:52.467
over his lair.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.757
The sanctuary
must be warded!

16:55.015 --> 16:56.880
You are
so wise, Ma'am.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.508
Anyway,
I have what I need.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.270
You do?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.352
Take the girl
somewhere you can end her,

17:03.607 --> 17:05.188
once and for all.

17:13.992 --> 17:17.655
Hi, I'm Dr. Taft.
How's it hanging?

17:17.913 --> 17:19.949
Judging by your pants,
high and to the left.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.664
Ha ha ha. That's good.

17:22.918 --> 17:24.499
So you're the human
behind all this?

17:24.753 --> 17:27.085
Yes and you're the latest
addition to my collection.

17:27.339 --> 17:30.297
I'm here to get Dyson, and
no mad scientist can stop me.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.716
How about a sane one?

17:35.096 --> 17:37.758
Thank god you're okay.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.348
You came for Dyson.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.478
I knew you would.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.351
Actually, I traced
the number on your phone.

17:50.612 --> 17:51.772
I can save you both.

17:52.030 --> 17:55.693
Actually, Dr. Lewis
doesn't need saving.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.361
She's my partner.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.075
That's a pretty
sick interpretation.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.865
Actually, it's a
pretty flattering one,

18:01.122 --> 18:03.113
I thought he was my boss.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.785
Lauren, what is this?

18:05.043 --> 18:07.580
The Fae ruined my life, Bo.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.829
They cursed my girlfriend,
they have held me prisoner,

18:11.091 --> 18:12.752
sometimes literally.

18:13.009 --> 18:17.844
And all the while,
my brain-- my talents,

18:18.098 --> 18:20.089
don't you see?

18:20.350 --> 18:23.888
This is a chance for me
to do something meaningful.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.272
To save my kind.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.434
You have been brainwashed.
This is not you.

18:28.692 --> 18:33.607
Please, Bo. Maybe
that was our problem.

18:33.863 --> 18:38.573
Did you know that my
name isn't even Lauren?

18:39.369 --> 18:45.831
Whoever you are I know you,
and I love you.

18:46.084 --> 18:49.702
And I loved you.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.750
Which is why I will
do the surgery,

18:53.008 --> 18:56.125
So long as you agree to
let Bo go, unharmed.

18:56.386 --> 18:57.341
What surgery?

18:57.595 --> 18:58.801
Color me skeptical.

18:59.055 --> 19:03.799
But why the change of heart?

19:04.060 --> 19:07.928
The Fae will never
let me live out there.

19:08.189 --> 19:11.272
Here I have a chance
to transform humanity--

19:11.526 --> 19:14.893
and take out the one man
who's stood in my way.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.144
Who?

19:16.406 --> 19:21.742
Dyson, Bo.
I can't save you both.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.987
Just like you
couldn't love us both.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.789
Goodbye.

19:33.048 --> 19:35.004
Take Bo to her cell.

19:37.886 --> 19:38.921
You are a monster.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.794
Oh no, not yet, not yet.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.843
I can't wait for you to
see me after, Succubus.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.840
I think you'll find
me very familiar.

19:53.568 --> 19:57.777
He took out six of my men before
we managed to sedate him.

19:58.031 --> 20:02.991
Oh well, all in the
name of science.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.204
Congratulations, my friend.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.164
lam not your friend.

20:10.418 --> 20:14.127
No. What you are, is
the fastest, strongest,

20:14.381 --> 20:19.501
most magnificent creature
that I have ever encountered.

20:20.303 --> 20:24.387
Do what you want with me.
Just let the others go.

20:24.641 --> 20:28.850
So noble! I hope that
doesn't rub off on me.

20:30.271 --> 20:37.018
Oh, I hope that temper
doesn't rub off on me either.

20:37.278 --> 20:41.863
I cannot wait to be the
recipient of all you have.

20:42.117 --> 20:44.483
And I can't wait to
feel what you feel.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.287
I'll see you on the
other side, my friend.

21:00.427 --> 21:03.760
I do like the wolf, you know.
It'd be nice if he survives.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.469
I wouldn't bet on it.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.482
It feels bad in here.

21:22.740 --> 21:23.695
You claustrophobic
or something?

21:23.950 --> 21:25.315
I lived with death.

21:25.577 --> 21:28.740
And whatever was in here
before us? Begged for it.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.453
Well hold it together, Tamsin.

21:30.707 --> 21:34.416
Because right now you
are all that I've got left.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.874
Bo?

21:39.132 --> 21:41.123
Sweetheart?

21:44.053 --> 21:45.088
Mom?

21:45.346 --> 21:47.007
No, it can't be. No.

21:47.265 --> 21:48.926
I gave them nothing.

21:49.184 --> 21:51.015
I gave them the wolf.

21:51.853 --> 21:55.471
You going
to introduce me?

21:55.732 --> 21:58.519
Tamsin, this is Aifa.

21:58.776 --> 22:01.768
My mom.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.689
They pit
Fae against Fae,

22:05.950 --> 22:07.565
make us feed off each other...

22:07.827 --> 22:10.990
Bo, my daughter. Bo.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.579
Keep her from the evil.

22:15.960 --> 22:16.949
Mom, it's okay.

22:17.212 --> 22:20.579
It's not okay,
you have to leave.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.799
If your father was here
he would kill them all.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.795
Then resurrect them
and kill them again.

22:28.056 --> 22:29.296
My father?

22:32.310 --> 22:34.050
They want powerful?

22:34.312 --> 22:35.768
They fear us?

22:36.022 --> 22:40.561
If he were here,
if he were here...

22:40.818 --> 22:44.060
he would never allow this
to happen to his seed.

22:46.658 --> 22:49.115
Mom, what does this have
to do with my father?

22:52.455 --> 22:53.319
I'm sorry.

22:56.501 --> 23:01.245
I don't need your pity.

23:01.506 --> 23:06.842
If these assholes want a
fight, let's give 'em one.

23:07.095 --> 23:09.051
Juice me.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.716
What are you doing?

23:11.975 --> 23:14.387
You really need to
learn how to share.

23:32.120 --> 23:32.905
Whoa.

23:36.499 --> 23:41.118
Feels like the Trojan war and
WWII running through my veins.

23:41.379 --> 23:44.041
You ready
to do this?

23:44.966 --> 23:47.457
Save it for the big show.

23:51.431 --> 23:54.673
Don't struggle Dyson.
It's futile.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.809
Lauren, why?!

23:59.063 --> 24:03.397
Because I've injected you
with six doses of anisthetic.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.609
Don't do this.

24:06.863 --> 24:08.478
You ready, Isaac?

24:11.034 --> 24:16.870
When was the last time you
actually operated on a human?

24:17.123 --> 24:18.329
Relax.

24:18.583 --> 24:21.074
This is the
last time you'll be human.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.005
Extracting bone marrow...

24:32.180 --> 24:35.718
Argh!

24:38.936 --> 24:42.099
I'm sorry-- but it has to be
done. I have to end this.

24:42.357 --> 24:44.222
Better, better.
But don't apologize.

24:44.484 --> 24:47.146
Be firm. Tell her you
expect full severance.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.813
The Morrigan's gonna
severance my heart

24:49.072 --> 24:51.609
from my chest if I
actually try to quit.

24:51.866 --> 24:54.653
There, good as gold.
Take a look.

24:54.911 --> 24:55.775
Thanks.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.197
I hate the sight of blood.

24:57.455 --> 25:00.288
Speaking of blood, I still
seem to have all of mine.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.918
Thank goddess for Trick's
anti-violence-in-the-lair

25:03.169 --> 25:03.919
thing-a-ma-protect—ums.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.832
You should
thank your hips.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.832
Bruce, I said we
could be friends.

25:10.093 --> 25:13.756
No, Kenzi-- I clocked it
earlier. Check your pocket.

25:17.558 --> 25:21.142
You know, from the poem?

25:21.396 --> 25:24.229
"To Clan Zamora,
a gift bestowed.

25:24.482 --> 25:27.064
"Immune to evil
deed, to blow.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.775
"For he who
carries sacred twig.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.146
"Immortality shall cling."

25:33.408 --> 25:35.865
Holy ballsauce, Bruce.

25:36.119 --> 25:38.576
I have a PhD in
Medieval Fae Verse.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.572
You're telling me, this
stick's what kept me safe?

25:41.833 --> 25:43.664
Somehow you've acquired
the Twig of Zamora.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.783
Which is weird because
traditionally it's passed down

25:46.045 --> 25:47.251
from father to son...

25:47.505 --> 25:49.461
Zamora.

25:49.716 --> 25:50.705
Oh, Hale.

25:50.967 --> 25:52.457
What about him?

25:54.262 --> 25:56.719
He just saved my life.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.634
[Fighting]

25:58.891 --> 26:00.392
Quit it,
or we get the dogs!

26:00.643 --> 26:02.144
For all we know, they are dogs.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.431
Hey, this
is unauthorized!

26:13.614 --> 26:15.696
Your move Valkyrie.

26:16.409 --> 26:19.822
You've disappointed me.
You've failed.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.035
You should be
unconcious right now.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.635
Nice job.

26:43.102 --> 26:47.061
[Gasping]

26:47.315 --> 26:52.560
If you find Dyson, he
has my Wilco bootleg.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.812
No, no, no.
Come on.

27:15.426 --> 27:18.088
Bless you, child. You
really are the chosen one.

27:20.765 --> 27:21.515
Where will we go?

27:21.766 --> 27:23.381
Anywhere but here.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.476
Who let my pets loose?

27:34.737 --> 27:37.695
No, no, no, no. No need
to restrain the Succubus.

27:39.742 --> 27:41.573
She'll be my first test.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.034
I normally don't do virgins.

27:43.287 --> 27:48.907
Don't you want to take a
little dance with the new me?

27:49.168 --> 27:52.126
Or would you
rather mate first?

27:57.134 --> 27:59.466
What did Lauren do to you?

27:59.720 --> 28:04.305
I am reborn, I'm Fae.

28:04.559 --> 28:09.019
Take it from me,
the learning curve is brutal.

28:09.272 --> 28:13.481
And I'm a quick study and I need
to get through that door, now.

28:13.734 --> 28:16.646
Then you'll have to get
through me first.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.940
Awesome.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.358
As you wish.

28:20.616 --> 28:21.901
No!

28:28.791 --> 28:30.327
Argh!

28:32.962 --> 28:33.712
Bo.

28:35.590 --> 28:38.923
Whatever he is? Needs to die.

28:42.847 --> 28:45.133
Oh, Mom. Mom?

28:49.145 --> 28:51.352
Mom, can you hear me?

28:51.606 --> 28:54.643
Of course
I can, Isabeau.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.859
You know, that was
my mother's name.

28:58.112 --> 29:00.398
Yes, I know.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.032
Trick told me everything.

29:02.283 --> 29:07.118
Trick... Look out
for him, Bo.

29:07.371 --> 29:11.705
What? Who?

29:11.959 --> 29:13.790
Trick?

29:14.045 --> 29:18.709
Taft? My father?

29:18.966 --> 29:20.376
We've gotta get out of here.

29:20.635 --> 29:23.798
No, I don't want
to leave her in this place.

29:24.055 --> 29:26.592
I left her once before,
and look what happened.

29:26.849 --> 29:31.138
This place took her
mind and her strength,

29:31.395 --> 29:33.226
but Aifa held on
just to protect you.

29:33.481 --> 29:35.642
Do not let that be in vain.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.265
I will stay with her.

29:37.526 --> 29:40.689
None of us will get out
of here if you do not.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.983
Thank you.

29:47.328 --> 29:50.536
Oh mom, I am so sorry.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.405
Time to go.

29:54.418 --> 29:58.502
I'm ready to end this.
Let's go!

30:13.104 --> 30:15.060
This place is
a freakin' maze.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.850
This is the operating room.

30:17.108 --> 30:20.726
Sorry, I don't think Dr.
Frankenbitch is here.

30:20.987 --> 30:25.947
Besides, I told you.
It's time to go.

30:26.993 --> 30:29.075
And where might that be?

30:30.538 --> 30:32.324
Wherever he wants you.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.242
I knew you'd betray me.

30:38.671 --> 30:39.626
Mmm.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.666
You played it well.

30:41.924 --> 30:45.883
You're smart.
Always liked that about you.

30:46.137 --> 30:48.674
And I've always known
I couldn't trust you.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.796
You should've learned
from the Dawning.

30:51.058 --> 30:53.174
Trust your instincts.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.685
I won't go easy.

30:56.939 --> 30:59.305
I know.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.728
That's why
I brought this.

31:01.986 --> 31:04.693
One hair from someone you trust,
two from someone you love,

31:04.947 --> 31:07.780
and three from your own head.

31:08.034 --> 31:12.277
Woven together by the kiss of
someone who'd never betray you.

31:15.750 --> 31:16.990
[Smash]

31:21.422 --> 31:24.414
Never known a Druid mix
to be a dud before.

31:24.675 --> 31:25.915
Maybe he fudged the recipe.

31:26.177 --> 31:29.294
Or maybe you don't love
and trust the way you claim.

31:29.555 --> 31:33.139
This isn't about me,
Tam Tam.

31:33.392 --> 31:37.010
This is about you.

31:38.939 --> 31:42.773
That taste, on your lips?

31:43.027 --> 31:46.736
Those feelings of doubt?

31:46.989 --> 31:50.652
Kinda sucks, huh?

31:50.910 --> 31:53.822
I'll just have to take
you down old school.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.662
I am stronger
and older.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.656
All I just heard?

31:58.918 --> 32:00.158
Was old.

32:03.130 --> 32:03.994
Baby Fae.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.462
Dead woman.

32:08.094 --> 32:11.336
Blood King, bested
by a car trunk?

32:11.597 --> 32:12.712
Not on my watch.

32:12.973 --> 32:16.682
[Footsteps approaching]

32:16.936 --> 32:20.178
I warn you, there will be no
mercy for someone fool enough

32:20.439 --> 32:23.977
to abduct me from my own
place of sanctuary--!

32:24.985 --> 32:28.819
No need to go all Wrath of the
Titans, old man. It's only me.

32:29.073 --> 32:32.657
[Chuckles] Get me outta here!

32:33.661 --> 32:36.277
[Crashing]

32:46.173 --> 32:47.583
You don't want to fight me.

32:47.842 --> 32:48.957
You want to succumb.

32:49.218 --> 32:53.962
What I want is your hideous
Skeletor face out of mine!

32:59.145 --> 33:02.808
Impressive, but you can't
resist me forever.

33:03.065 --> 33:04.851
That's my line.

33:11.532 --> 33:14.444
Tastes like fear to me.
Delicious.

33:14.702 --> 33:16.613
Playtime's over.

33:46.442 --> 33:47.397
No.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.770
C'mon. Finish it!

33:54.074 --> 33:59.034
I'm not doing that.
And you don't want to do this.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.454
You can stop too.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.039
Shut up.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.872
You have a choice.

34:08.130 --> 34:11.122
I'm already dead.

34:11.383 --> 34:15.968
You are more alive than
anyone I've ever met.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.932
I don't know what to do.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.762
Fight.

34:34.782 --> 34:36.192
It's okay.

34:36.450 --> 34:41.740
No. No, no, no,
I've cursed us.

34:41.997 --> 34:45.831
You have no idea.

34:46.085 --> 34:49.498
He's gonna come after us.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.620
No. You need to listen to me.

34:51.882 --> 34:53.668
We need to get the
team back together,

34:53.926 --> 34:59.546
regroup, okay?
Somewhere safe!

34:59.807 --> 35:01.047
Safe.

35:01.308 --> 35:03.890
Yeah.

35:04.144 --> 35:05.133
Okay.

35:07.147 --> 35:08.933
I'm gonna get Dyson.

35:09.191 --> 35:12.024
And I'll find Kenzi.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.853
What about Lauren?

35:16.115 --> 35:18.948
I don't know where
they took her.

35:21.537 --> 35:26.076
You're not like
anyone I've ever met.

35:26.333 --> 35:30.326
In any of my many lifetimes.

35:40.097 --> 35:41.212
Let's go.

35:42.099 --> 35:43.964
Meet me at the Dal.

35:44.977 --> 35:46.387
My last act as the Acting Ash

35:46.645 --> 35:49.102
was protecting the Blood King
from the clutches of the Dark.

35:49.356 --> 35:50.971
Last piece?

35:51.233 --> 35:53.724
Turns out politics
wasn't my thing.

35:53.986 --> 35:55.351
So what now?

36:00.075 --> 36:01.281
Stella.

36:08.584 --> 36:11.747
Stella's got
a gig in Scotland.

36:12.004 --> 36:16.418
As good a place as any to hide
out, 'til this battle is won.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.633
You are wrong. You would
have made a great Ash.

36:20.804 --> 36:24.422
Later.
I gotta see about a girl.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.215
What about The Morrigan?

36:26.477 --> 36:31.722
Don't worry about it.
I got a guy on the inside.

36:34.943 --> 36:37.229
Her Royal Thighness
is ready for delivery.

36:37.488 --> 36:39.729
Provided you're
clear on what I'll get

36:39.990 --> 36:42.367
for playing my part, Hale.

36:47.790 --> 36:51.749
Stop struggling, dearest.
You bruise so easily.

36:52.002 --> 36:55.460
Yep, yeah, that
sounds acceptable.

36:55.714 --> 37:00.629
We'll hash it out over
a nice cup of tea. Ta!

37:00.886 --> 37:04.754
It's like my birthday,
La Shoshain,

37:05.015 --> 37:11.261
and the St. Valentine's Day
Massacre, all rolled into one!

37:15.776 --> 37:18.859
Hang on, hang on!

37:19.113 --> 37:21.525
You can't kill me.

37:21.782 --> 37:22.862
I'm pretty sure I can.

37:23.117 --> 37:28.703
No, no.
We're connected. Brothers.

37:28.956 --> 37:30.321
You were right about one thing.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.698
What's that?

37:32.960 --> 37:36.077
Dr. Lewis is a genius.

37:36.338 --> 37:38.750
She somehow mixed
Fae DNA with yours.

37:39.007 --> 37:42.750
I know it. I can feel it.

37:46.807 --> 37:49.139
But it wasn't mine.

37:49.393 --> 37:52.977
You're half human.
Half Cabbit.

37:54.148 --> 37:55.979
No.

37:57.109 --> 37:58.474
No!

37:58.735 --> 38:03.775
Despite you forcing them to do
it, Fae don't usually eat Fae.

38:04.032 --> 38:09.823
But for you, I think I'm
gonna make an exception.

38:10.080 --> 38:14.414
Listen to me, I'm a
billionaire! A billionaire!

38:14.668 --> 38:16.704
I can make it
worth while, for you!

38:16.962 --> 38:20.079
Best thing I can offer
you is a head start.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.591
Not gonna make
much difference.

38:21.842 --> 38:24.629
But at least it'll
make it more fun.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.670
For me.

38:49.495 --> 38:50.735
Look out for surprise attacks.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.612
Surprise. I'm huge.
I don't do stealth.

38:53.874 --> 38:56.160
Bruce, I'll be fine.
Really, you have to go.

38:56.418 --> 38:58.283
If The Morrigan finds
out you helped me...

38:58.545 --> 39:00.706
The Morrigan just declared
you an enemy of the realm.

39:00.964 --> 39:03.171
I'm not leaving your
side 'til you're safe.

39:03.425 --> 39:04.790
You're tough, Kenzi.

39:05.052 --> 39:05.586
But you're human.

39:05.844 --> 39:06.879
Not for long.

39:07.137 --> 39:08.092
What?

39:12.100 --> 39:14.716
I met someone who said
he could make me Fae.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.060
Think I'm going to
take him up on it.

39:17.314 --> 39:18.850
Bad idea.

39:19.107 --> 39:21.814
I'll probably owe Massimo
for the rest of my life, but...

39:22.069 --> 39:24.731
Massimo, the Druid?
Really bad idea!

39:24.988 --> 39:28.446
My friends need me, Bruce.
Need me to nut up.

39:28.700 --> 39:33.660
Do the rescuing, for once.
And I can't when I'm-- this.

39:33.914 --> 39:35.404
I'm not letting you
meet him alone.

39:35.666 --> 39:37.156
Well, it's a long walk.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.452
Who's walking?

39:40.003 --> 39:43.962
The Morrigan's new toy.
And you get to drive.

39:45.425 --> 39:46.881
I love you!

39:47.135 --> 39:48.716
I love you too, Kenzi.

39:48.971 --> 39:50.882
I was talking to the car.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.050
Uh, idiot.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.470
Just-- try to keep
it on the road.

39:56.728 --> 40:01.267
Road? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

40:09.366 --> 40:12.984
I don't remember
calling in for a ride.

40:13.245 --> 40:14.280
Get in.

40:24.965 --> 40:25.875
You're looking pretty rough.

40:26.133 --> 40:27.919
You should have
seen the other guy.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.131
I bet.

40:29.678 --> 40:33.091
I'm so stubborn.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.680
I should have
expired years ago.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.220
Now there's
nowhere to run.

40:38.687 --> 40:42.646
Whatever it is,
we'll get through it together.

40:47.154 --> 40:51.693
[Radio] J) Well, I'm the type of
guy who will never settle down J)

40:51.950 --> 40:53.156
That song...

40:53.869 --> 40:55.905
I heard this during
Bo's Dawning.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.579
It's Bo's father.

41:04.087 --> 41:04.917
What?

41:05.631 --> 41:09.294
You know, we all
have to make choices.

41:09.551 --> 41:12.714
[Car accelerating]

41:12.971 --> 41:15.007
Tamsin, what are you doing?

41:17.517 --> 41:18.427
Tamsin!

41:20.604 --> 41:21.719
We all gotta die someday.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.891
Tamsin stop the car!

41:25.525 --> 41:26.651
Slow down!

41:49.424 --> 41:53.258
Kenzi? Trick?

41:53.512 --> 41:56.504

You're right.

42:22.124 --> 42:24.740
I don't.

42:25.001 --> 42:29.961
But when I figure it out, you
are in serious shit, Wanderer.

42:43.395 --> 42:48.230
Cards and music. Got anything
other than parlour tricks?

42:48.483 --> 42:53.193
[Boom]
