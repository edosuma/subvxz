Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express.

00:05.640 --> 00:10.714
Come and watch pikeys making
a mess of the lives they were given

00:12.215 --> 00:14.638
by 'im upstairs.

00:14.628 --> 00:18.064
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:18.056 --> 00:19.148
Stay away!

00:19.142 --> 00:21.667
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace...

00:21.660 --> 00:22.934
Oi!

00:22.924 --> 00:25.904
..kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:25.895 --> 00:29.592
Cos this, people reckon -
and me included -

00:29.592 --> 00:33.380
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented.

00:33.374 --> 00:37.162
To calm us all down to
stop us going mental.

00:37.156 --> 00:41.536
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.529 --> 00:43.747
We are worth every penny.

00:43.745 --> 00:48.045
For grinding your
axes you shit on our head.

00:48.141 --> 00:50.441
But you pay the taxes.

00:53.553 --> 00:57.489
Imagine a Britain without
Chatsworth buccaneers

00:57.486 --> 01:01.104
who'd cum on your face for the price
of a beer. Make poverty history,

01:01.094 --> 01:03.642
cheaper drugs now!

01:03.643 --> 01:07.181
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

'Batman's drowning his sorrows
in the corner of a bar.

01:23.163 --> 01:25.609
'Some Joker starts a fight.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.648
'It gets out of hand -
glasses flying.

01:27.645 --> 01:29.863
'So why doesn't he step in?

01:29.863 --> 01:31.945
'Because he's not Batman,

01:31.938 --> 01:36.728
'he's one of them whingeing
Fathers For Justice twats.

01:38.291 --> 01:42.330
'Now, don't get me wrong,
having kids is great.

01:42.326 --> 01:44.612
'You can make good money from them.

01:44.608 --> 01:47.008
'But why would you
want to ruin a good thing

01:47.005 --> 01:48.916
'by having one of your own?

01:55.192 --> 01:56.932
Who's the fucking daddy?

02:00.437 --> 02:03.133
What's that?

02:03.131 --> 02:05.804
Is that spending money
your grand-daddy's giving you?

02:07.444 --> 02:09.719
Big girls need to
look after their money.

02:09.715 --> 02:11.933
What have we got here?

02:11.928 --> 02:14.305
Don't forget to water down
the spirits,

02:14.304 --> 02:17.057
and there's a brewery delivery
at five tomorrow.

02:17.051 --> 02:18.928
I've cooked and frozen enough meals

02:18.925 --> 02:22.292
for the pair of you to last till
me and Katie get back from Brighton.

02:22.284 --> 02:24.104
All you have to do is
ping it and eat it.

02:24.103 --> 02:26.779
Ta, Mam, have a good 'un.

02:26.878 --> 02:28.755
Hey, I've got it all planned.

02:28.745 --> 02:30.918
After I've dropped Katie off
at her dad's,

02:30.917 --> 02:33.192
it's sea, shopping and cock...

02:33.192 --> 02:35.774
ling. Favourite past time of mine,

02:35.772 --> 02:37.262
a Sunday was never a Sunday

02:37.251 --> 02:39.765
without a trip to the
cockle beds of New Brighton.

02:40.835 --> 02:44.009
A weekend trip once in a
blue moon to see her dad.

02:44.001 --> 02:45.320
It's not right, is it?

02:45.310 --> 02:49.189
She'll be in tears on that train
ride back up here Sunday night.

02:49.188 --> 02:51.236
And who'll be left
to pick up t'pieces?

02:51.234 --> 02:53.520
Us, as per usual.

02:53.511 --> 02:56.105
What you playing at? Eh?

02:56.097 --> 02:57.121
Oi.

02:57.119 --> 02:59.098
Who the fuck do you think you are?

02:59.097 --> 03:02.772
Do you know who you're messing
with? Where's my money?

03:02.766 --> 03:04.017
Take it outside.

03:09.119 --> 03:10.507
Go on.

03:13.658 --> 03:17.150
He think's he's invincible cos
Chesney and Carl are wanted
for what he did.

03:17.144 --> 03:19.362
Not one fucking person
believes he did it.

03:19.362 --> 03:21.171
He's taking liberties.

03:21.165 --> 03:23.372
Dad, he needs putting in his place.

03:23.368 --> 03:27.634
Going to miss your Grand-daddy, yeah?
Give us a kiss.

03:27.628 --> 03:28.993
Take care, sweetheart.

03:28.986 --> 03:31.090
Right, come on Katie, say bye-bye.

03:31.079 --> 03:32.228
See you all.

03:32.228 --> 03:33.081
Bye.

03:32.228 --> 03:34.059
Bye.
Bye, darling.

03:41.342 --> 03:43.492
What is it with you and my family?

03:43.491 --> 03:44.901
You must mean Carl.

03:46.010 --> 03:47.773
Cos I ain't got around to Liam yet.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.944
Maine Road as it was then.

04:22.172 --> 04:26.723
Cockneys with fear in their eyes
looking for cabs in Moss Side.

04:26.719 --> 04:29.722
Proper football, you know?

04:29.717 --> 04:32.106
Total football.

04:32.097 --> 04:35.373
Pie and a pint,
not a prawn sandwich in sight.

04:37.331 --> 04:43.054
It was a time when players fought
for the badge not the money.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.097
Good men.

04:47.096 --> 04:48.779
Good, honest...

04:48.771 --> 04:51.080
family men.

04:52.714 --> 04:55.717
Just...just like meself.

05:01.026 --> 05:04.575
We stood on those terraces,
man and boy.

05:06.292 --> 05:08.931
Hand in hand.

05:08.925 --> 05:10.369
You and me.

05:13.059 --> 05:15.345
We can do it again, son.

05:17.097 --> 05:19.110
Eastlands.

05:19.105 --> 05:20.504
Nothing else on telly?

05:20.500 --> 05:21.967
Turn it over!

05:21.964 --> 05:24.751
Please, Carl, just come home.

05:24.744 --> 05:26.735
CHEERING

05:26.734 --> 05:29.248
Yeah, fuck you!

05:29.240 --> 05:32.971
Oh, police want to interview me,
she says.

05:32.970 --> 05:36.383
What I actually said was,
"You're wanted for
a police interview."

05:36.373 --> 05:38.853
Yeah, and I'm dragged in
for a televised appeal

05:38.845 --> 05:41.052
begging the little
tosspot to come home.

05:41.046 --> 05:41.751
You were crying.

05:41.046 --> 05:43.219
You were crying.
Me eyes were watering.

05:43.219 --> 05:46.962
I've an allergy to
high-pressurised situations.

05:46.958 --> 05:47.424
He's your son!

05:46.958 --> 05:49.142
He's your son!
He made his bed. Let him lie in it.

05:49.137 --> 05:50.399
Crocodile tears dried up, have they?

05:50.389 --> 05:53.074
Just the usual, and no
more smart-arse remarks

05:54.234 --> 05:57.101
If that was one of mine,
I'd be out there turning

05:57.096 --> 05:59.769
every last stone, not drowning
my pitiful sorrows

05:59.766 --> 06:02.792
and crying like a big
girl's corset on national television.

06:02.782 --> 06:05.637
With a father like you, is it
any wonder the kid did a runner?

06:05.636 --> 06:08.309
Guilty as charged, Paddy!

06:08.301 --> 06:10.633
What I think the author
is trying to say

06:10.631 --> 06:13.828
is that we mustn't give up
on the ones we love.

06:13.828 --> 06:16.365
And would anyone
like to read a passage

06:16.365 --> 06:18.401
that encapsulates that sentiment?

06:18.391 --> 06:23.033
Face it, Libby, it's not the lure
of literature, it's the free plonk.

06:25.250 --> 06:28.526
My place Saturday. Italian night.

06:28.519 --> 06:32.387
Carbonara, Captain Corelli's
Mandolin.

06:32.377 --> 06:34.379
We'll never get that read in time!

06:34.376 --> 06:38.324
I'll rent the DVD. It's better
than pissing about with the books.

06:38.318 --> 06:39.888
Drink to that!

06:42.019 --> 06:43.805
Sorry.

06:43.797 --> 06:48.985
It's not your fault.
Classic post-traumatic malfunction.

06:48.977 --> 06:50.911
Two options.

06:50.906 --> 06:53.909
Half a Viagra and a
glass of grapefruit juice.

06:53.907 --> 06:57.172
Or you go to the police
and get closure.

06:57.169 --> 06:58.625
They wouldn't believe me.

06:58.622 --> 07:02.080
You're a canvas of evidence, Ian.

07:02.078 --> 07:03.887
Jimmy's on a suspended.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.805
If the police can't touch him
for Bonehead's murder,

07:06.797 --> 07:08.128
he'd go down for this.

07:08.125 --> 07:11.401
And then there's nothing to
stop Carl from coming home.

07:13.170 --> 07:14.501
Is that what this is about?

07:15.817 --> 07:17.580
You want him to come back, don't you?

07:17.573 --> 07:18.585
No.

07:18.584 --> 07:20.074
What?

07:20.066 --> 07:21.931
He's a fucking trouble magnet.

07:21.931 --> 07:24.172
Everything he touches turns to shit.

07:24.164 --> 07:26.712
I thought you would have
sussed that out by now.

07:28.088 --> 07:29.589
(GROANS)

07:30.625 --> 07:31.705
Where is he?

07:31.706 --> 07:33.890
MOBILE RINGS

07:35.595 --> 07:38.439
Bacon! To what do I owe the honour?

07:58.425 --> 07:59.426
Search warrant.

08:01.837 --> 08:06.888
They're ripping the place apart.
They're not going to find anything
embarrassing, are they, Frank?

08:06.880 --> 08:09.280
Well, there's Libby's
love bunny under the pillow.

08:09.279 --> 08:11.998
She meant drugs, you twat.

08:14.020 --> 08:17.592
I meant evidence that
would put Carl behind bars.

08:17.587 --> 08:19.646
Carl's an innocent man!

08:19.646 --> 08:21.375
(PADDY COUGHS)

08:21.369 --> 08:23.451
Not that it's any of my business,

08:23.444 --> 08:27.028
but a little bird has just
told me the cops have confirmed

08:27.018 --> 08:31.432
that blood found on clothes taken
from Chesney's is Bonehead's.

08:31.422 --> 08:33.207
Pint.

08:33.203 --> 08:35.717
What the fuck you looking at?

08:35.714 --> 08:38.581
So that's what you think,
now, is it? My Carl's guilty?

08:38.572 --> 08:42.053
Doesn't matter what I think,
Gallagher, the evidence is mounting.

08:42.051 --> 08:43.746
OK, thick as pig shit? Maybe.

08:43.736 --> 08:46.751
Brains wired directly into
his testicles? Definitely.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.310
But a murderer? Fu... Come on!

08:49.301 --> 08:51.633
We all know who's
really responsible.

08:56.572 --> 08:58.472
You got something you want to say?

09:02.874 --> 09:04.159
My son is innocent.

09:04.154 --> 09:05.769
Well, tell that to the police.

09:05.762 --> 09:09.300
Am I the only one that has
had enough of this gobshite?

09:09.290 --> 09:11.679
Now fuck off before
I fucking beat the...

09:16.709 --> 09:19.507
Not on my patch, son.

09:19.502 --> 09:21.697
You're small fry.
Not worth the effort.

09:21.690 --> 09:24.807
But lay one finger
on any of mine again

09:24.800 --> 09:29.612
and you'll see I'm not above
fishing for tiddlers. Now, get!

09:29.602 --> 09:32.048
Go on!

09:34.677 --> 09:37.601
Nice one, Dad.

MOBILE RINGS

09:42.849 --> 09:45.010
Hi, Mum.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.447
All right, yeah, OK, I'm on me way.

09:50.188 --> 09:51.871
What's got into you?

10:09.102 --> 10:10.308
What's this about, Shane?

10:10.301 --> 10:11.859
I'm celebrating.

10:11.856 --> 10:13.187
Celebrating what?

10:13.181 --> 10:15.649
Freedom. A life of do
what you want to do

10:15.644 --> 10:19.478
whenever the fuck you,
you want to do it, freedom.

10:19.468 --> 10:20.605
What you on about?

10:20.603 --> 10:23.527
You and me, come on.
The two of us forever.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.660
Get off.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.227
Have you two had a barney?

10:26.218 --> 10:27.731
No.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.405
VOMITING

10:30.399 --> 10:33.607
What the fuck was all
that about in the pub, then?

10:33.606 --> 10:36.678
You better have a damned good
reason for pulling that stunt.

10:41.523 --> 10:45.175
I double check negative results,
I'm never wrong.

10:51.512 --> 10:53.468
You're firing blanks?

10:57.288 --> 10:59.256
COUGHING

10:59.250 --> 11:03.778
Sperm donation was hardly going
to make you a millionaire, was it?

11:03.767 --> 11:06.372
Although plenty of wankers are.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.869
It wasn't about the money, it was...

11:08.867 --> 11:10.027
What?

11:11.882 --> 11:13.793
You said you didn't want kids.

11:13.786 --> 11:15.640
And you agreed.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.153
I was fine with it then.

11:20.649 --> 11:23.573
But just seeing our
Jamie with Connor

11:23.569 --> 11:26.254
and...little Katie legging around.

11:27.501 --> 11:29.890
Me and you
looking out for Stella and Liam.

11:31.579 --> 11:32.864
It just got me thinking.

11:32.862 --> 11:35.524
You know, thoughts that
I'd never even thought of.

11:35.522 --> 11:38.173
I was feeling stuff
that I never thought I'd feel.

11:38.165 --> 11:41.316
So you thought, "I'll knock one off
in a clinic and, wi' a bit of luck,

11:41.307 --> 11:43.969
"in nine months there'll be
a little me knocking about."

11:43.964 --> 11:48.071
Kelly...
Everywhere I look, I see babies.

11:48.061 --> 11:49.972
Then stop looking.

11:52.309 --> 11:54.243
Fuck's sake, Shane.

11:59.201 --> 12:01.977
You know and I know
it's an impossible dream.

12:04.314 --> 12:05.941
Just get over it.

12:08.536 --> 12:09.685
Here you go, Mum.

12:13.961 --> 12:15.303
Oh, god!

12:15.302 --> 12:18.214
You might as well walk around
with targets on your back.

12:18.210 --> 12:21.509
Sometimes you have to put yourself at
risk for the things you believe in.

12:21.502 --> 12:23.652
And the people you're
supposed to love!

12:23.647 --> 12:27.037
Look at the Suffragettes,
Tiananmen Square, Greenham Common.

12:27.031 --> 12:31.491
History is shaped, Frank, by people
standing up for what they believe in.

12:31.490 --> 12:33.663
Yeah? A dead hero's no hero, son.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.041
They're on to you already.

12:37.036 --> 12:38.970
Get down! Get down!

12:38.966 --> 12:40.979
Get...cut?

12:40.977 --> 12:42.126
Get out.

12:46.019 --> 12:49.318
Police, please.
This is Libby Croker...

12:49.318 --> 12:50.842
What the fuck are you doing?

12:50.839 --> 12:53.046
I thought you had more
backbone than that.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.953
She really doesn't know you,
does she?

12:55.949 --> 12:58.588
Take it from someone
who's had years of experience

12:58.578 --> 13:00.114
getting their arse kicked.

13:00.106 --> 13:03.416
Best course of action, shut
the fuck up and keep your head down.

13:03.413 --> 13:05.290
We have to stand up to them, Frank.

13:05.281 --> 13:07.374
Yeah, well, best of
luck with that one.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.771
God almighty!

13:11.442 --> 13:13.501
All they've got is
Sammy's stupid statement.

13:13.499 --> 13:15.035
Big deal.
It's her word against ours.

13:15.030 --> 13:17.089
Two against one.

13:17.082 --> 13:18.356
What?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.440
It's not just the statement.

13:23.439 --> 13:24.997
They raided your house

13:24.991 --> 13:28.324
and found some clothes
covered in Bonehead's blood.

13:29.968 --> 13:33.608
They've got you down for murder,
and Carl as your accomplice.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.030
I didn't even know
they were trying for kids.

13:43.582 --> 13:46.233
I wonder if it tastes any different.

13:47.854 --> 13:49.583
You know,
like you can always tell

13:49.578 --> 13:51.512
if lager's non-alcoholic
or cola's diet.

13:53.727 --> 13:57.322
I'm just saying, Kelly would
have known already, wouldn't she?

13:57.319 --> 13:59.594
All the spam javelin she has.

14:03.022 --> 14:05.877
It's a terrible affliction for a man.

14:05.871 --> 14:08.726
So we put our heads together
and come up with a solution.

14:13.282 --> 14:15.512
Someone's a bit down in the dumps.

14:15.508 --> 14:17.157
Chocolate's a dead give away.

14:17.154 --> 14:19.930
Unless it's a substitute for
Ian not...giving you enough.

14:19.930 --> 14:21.852
Yeah, or maybe it's
just because I'm hungry.

14:24.036 --> 14:25.970
Can you put one of these
up in your window?

14:27.348 --> 14:30.670
Go and get us another one,
give us ten.

14:30.668 --> 14:32.818
Nice one.

14:32.818 --> 14:36.709
What's the point? Carl and Chesney
are a pair of selfish bastards.

14:36.699 --> 14:38.314
A bit out of order.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.779
Everyone's going through hell
because of him.

14:40.770 --> 14:42.863
Windows smashed in, house terrorised,

14:42.859 --> 14:45.771
but that's nothing compared
to not knowing where he is,

14:45.769 --> 14:48.920
what's happened to him.
But he's fucked off, hasn't he?

14:48.917 --> 14:50.669
What's out of sight is out of mind.

14:50.662 --> 14:53.017
He doesn't give a shit
about anyone but himself.

14:53.008 --> 14:54.805
MOBILE RINGS

15:05.647 --> 15:07.103
Why didn't you call me?

15:07.098 --> 15:08.360
And put you at risk?

15:08.358 --> 15:12.260
You can't tell anyone we're here.
If Jimmy finds out, we're all dead.

15:12.252 --> 15:15.176
And if the cops get us,
we're going down.

15:15.172 --> 15:16.616
How's Ian?

15:17.918 --> 15:21.445
Angry, scared, hurt.

15:21.444 --> 15:22.786
So what's the plan?

15:26.971 --> 15:29.872
Have I got to do
everything around here?

15:29.869 --> 15:31.882
I need your little black book.

15:36.668 --> 15:38.590
DOOR OPENS

15:38.582 --> 15:39.844
Make it quick.

15:39.845 --> 15:42.268
I want you to retract your statement.

15:42.268 --> 15:43.724
I'm sticking by what I saw.

15:43.722 --> 15:46.589
But you didn't see anything.

15:46.582 --> 15:48.561
Everybody knows Jimmy did it.

15:48.557 --> 15:52.232
Without your statement,
Carl and Chesney can come home.

15:52.225 --> 15:55.092
And Jimmy could go down.
He's my brother.

15:55.081 --> 15:57.481
And he's ruining your life.

15:57.476 --> 16:00.866
What Bonehead did was wrong but
he didn't deserve to die for it.

16:00.858 --> 16:04.055
What, is Jimmy's going to that
to every bloke that disses ya?

16:04.050 --> 16:05.210
He cares about me.

16:05.207 --> 16:09.098
He controls you. Just like he
controls everybody 'round here.

16:09.094 --> 16:12.416
You are just as trapped
as Carl and Chesney.

16:14.677 --> 16:19.011
If you could see what this
is doing to 'em, Sammy.

16:19.002 --> 16:21.288
They're back.

16:21.284 --> 16:22.444
Jesus, they're back.

16:22.442 --> 16:23.602
DOOR OPENS

16:26.024 --> 16:27.912
What you talking to this sweat for?

16:27.906 --> 16:30.761
She's just told me Carl and
Chesney have been in touch.

16:30.761 --> 16:34.242
They've decided to stay where they
are, till they know it's safer.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.526
For everyone. In't that right?

16:39.300 --> 16:40.483
Get out.

16:48.044 --> 16:50.217
Hear from them again,
say hello from me.

16:50.207 --> 16:53.472
And tell Carl I'll keep an
eye on Liam and Ian for him.

16:55.704 --> 16:57.922
Make sure they don't
come to any harm.

17:05.901 --> 17:08.938
Frank said I could get
some literary advice here.

17:08.928 --> 17:12.750
Did he? That's great.
We're reading Captain Corelli's...

17:12.746 --> 17:16.386
Actually, I was looking
for help on the creative side.

17:16.384 --> 17:17.464
Oh.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.890
He said you charge
a flat fee of 10%?

17:20.884 --> 17:23.182
Me Job Seekers Allowance form.

17:23.182 --> 17:27.255
It needs someone with a...
creative touch.

17:29.996 --> 17:32.146
Cheers, Percy. See you again.

17:32.142 --> 17:35.043
Oh, right, Margi,

17:35.040 --> 17:37.361
that's a flat rate, 10%.

17:37.352 --> 17:38.956
No more.

17:40.607 --> 17:42.620
Just give us a minute, will ya?

17:42.618 --> 17:45.030
I've been wrestling with
me conscience all morning.

17:45.027 --> 17:46.460
Oh, yeah and who won?

17:46.456 --> 17:49.357
This is benefit fraud.
I'm party to a crime.

17:49.352 --> 17:51.308
They're not doing it
for duck islands

17:51.299 --> 17:53.472
and having their moats drained,
are they?

17:53.467 --> 17:56.186
It's not greed that's
motivating them, it's hunger.

17:58.926 --> 18:02.214
Margi's husband, Arthur, was
shot in Afghanistan two years ago.

18:02.205 --> 18:05.504
Do you think she gets any back-up
from the shit bags in power?

18:05.500 --> 18:09.197
No, she's still struggling to cope
with the death of a brilliant father

18:09.191 --> 18:13.082
and husband who just happened to be
the only bread winner in the family.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.093
Your call, Lib.

18:17.085 --> 18:19.360
Just give me a minute.

18:27.570 --> 18:29.640
Is it the Afghanistan story again?

18:29.630 --> 18:32.224
Yeah, I think it's best.
How is the old bastard?

18:32.213 --> 18:33.350
Still an old bastard.

18:37.287 --> 18:38.766
Right, next, please.

18:42.714 --> 18:45.194
Oh, right, come in, lads.

18:45.186 --> 18:48.064
Now, I just need to ask
a few questions.

18:54.136 --> 18:56.366
Good looking, guaranteed.

18:56.356 --> 18:57.914
Don't think so.

18:57.913 --> 19:01.132
Stick it in the fridge, good lad.
They can run it up the clinic later.

19:01.130 --> 19:03.462
This one's not past
its sell by date, Dad.

19:03.457 --> 19:06.745
Mine's tried and tested.
Five times over, that I know about.

19:06.741 --> 19:08.459
Yeah, but I'm fresh. Virginal.

19:08.453 --> 19:09.659
We'll toss for it.

19:09.650 --> 19:11.789
Again? I'm whacked out.

19:11.787 --> 19:13.152
A coin.

19:13.146 --> 19:14.158
Three ways?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.064
Between me and Micky.

19:16.063 --> 19:18.293
At least we're the same generation.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.084
Fair's fair.

19:23.426 --> 19:25.496
Wisdom of Solomon.

19:25.494 --> 19:27.655
We'll mix them.

19:37.909 --> 19:40.082
What?

19:40.078 --> 19:43.559
I was like full to bursting.
Haven't had a bl...ird for ages.

19:51.586 --> 19:53.122
What's so important?

19:53.116 --> 19:58.144
IVF'll cost you a fortune,
so we thought we'd all, you know...

20:20.164 --> 20:22.780
We've mixed it all up so you
won't know whose is whose,

20:22.779 --> 20:24.383
but chances are it'll be mine.

20:24.376 --> 20:26.674
I knocked out six and
I'm a cracking swimmer,

20:26.674 --> 20:28.448
so mine'll be in there
like swimwear.

20:28.446 --> 20:31.415
You think Kelly'll be up for it?

20:31.414 --> 20:37.114
I didn't take to the idea meself at
first, but when you think about it,

20:37.114 --> 20:41.005
the DNA will be
near enough identical.

20:41.003 --> 20:42.675
Nobody will know it's not mine.

20:42.668 --> 20:47.219
Except me, you, your dad,
Jamie, oh, and Micky.

20:48.713 --> 20:49.759
Faster!

20:49.760 --> 20:51.614
Yes, mistress.

20:53.499 --> 20:55.399
Tell your dad thanks for the offer

20:55.398 --> 20:58.196
but I'd rather die than have
any part of him in me again!

21:02.084 --> 21:04.120
Sorry. Shane, I didn't mean...

21:06.341 --> 21:07.433
HE BARKS

21:07.430 --> 21:09.227
Oh, shut the fuck up!

21:10.877 --> 21:14.517
She won't budge.
Not while Jimmy's around at least.

21:14.516 --> 21:15.904
We're fucked.

21:15.903 --> 21:17.234
Something'll come up.

21:17.227 --> 21:20.310
Clothes with blood on 'em!
Statement from Sammy.

21:20.309 --> 21:22.777
Footage from the phone
for all we know.

21:22.768 --> 21:24.895
We're fucked! I'm calling Mum.

21:24.886 --> 21:27.275
Taliban's easier to
deal with than this shit.

21:27.265 --> 21:29.221
You'll never make it
out the country.

21:29.213 --> 21:32.660
Your names will be at every passport
control desk at every airport.

21:32.658 --> 21:36.355
So what do we do, Joe, just
wait here till they come for us?!

21:36.354 --> 21:39.414
No. We wait here until we
figure out our next move.

21:39.414 --> 21:41.837
It'll be OK.

21:43.604 --> 21:45.652
Hello?

21:45.651 --> 21:47.107
Stay here.

21:59.163 --> 22:00.209
Empty your pockets.

22:03.987 --> 22:05.818
Just a bit of business

22:11.370 --> 22:14.282
What you two do behind my
son's back is your business.

22:14.276 --> 22:16.972
Secret's safe with me,
my silence is easily bought.

22:16.971 --> 22:19.895
I'll have 60 fags as well.

22:19.891 --> 22:21.233
Piss off, Frank.

22:21.232 --> 22:24.156
Take anything else and I'll
break your fuckin' arms.

22:28.476 --> 22:31.309
Well, I'll just pay a little
visit to Ian then, shall I?

22:31.301 --> 22:32.654
See what he has to say...

22:56.802 --> 22:58.212
You OK?

23:01.382 --> 23:03.304
If the writing
on the wall's wrong...

23:05.004 --> 23:07.757
If what I know about you
is incorrect.

23:09.359 --> 23:11.270
If you did it.

23:11.261 --> 23:12.307
What?

23:12.301 --> 23:15.873
No, listen. If you did it, I'm here.
With ya.

23:15.870 --> 23:17.588
Is that what you think?

23:17.578 --> 23:19.728
Well, innocent men don't run, son.

23:19.726 --> 23:21.887
Well, I'll go to the police then.

23:21.885 --> 23:24.058
Did you ejaculate
both your brain cells?

23:24.047 --> 23:27.346
Piss off before somebody else
goes down in the crossfire.

23:27.346 --> 23:30.133
Just leave, son.
There's fuck all here for ya now.

23:30.122 --> 23:32.727
I'm going nowhere.

23:32.722 --> 23:34.098
Please, son.

23:34.092 --> 23:35.434
Just go.

23:35.433 --> 23:39.017
When Jimmy finds out that
you're back, which he will...

23:40.268 --> 23:41.565
He'll...

23:45.878 --> 23:48.506
I don't want to lose you, son.

23:48.502 --> 23:50.993
And Ian's taken a hiding and...

23:50.993 --> 23:52.847
He's got Ian?

23:52.844 --> 23:55.130
And he'll pick us off one by one.

23:57.256 --> 23:58.291
Just go.

24:08.323 --> 24:11.872
Hi, Lillian, sorry we're late.
I've brought Liam as well.
I hope that's OK?

24:11.865 --> 24:15.175
He's been here more times than
half the vicars we service.

24:15.169 --> 24:16.067
You know Trixie, Liam?

24:16.062 --> 24:17.154
You know Trixie, Liam?
Yeah.

24:17.151 --> 24:20.871
Didn't want to leave him on his own.
He's worrying himself
sick about Carl.

24:20.867 --> 24:25.088
Add a drop of that, love,
while I stir. What do you think?

24:26.660 --> 24:27.627
Mmm. Lovely.

24:31.353 --> 24:33.366
Are you having tea with us, Kelly?

24:34.926 --> 24:38.521
What say you come round ours, Liam?
Lillian's cooking ain't up to much.

24:38.518 --> 24:39.803
That's lovely that is.

24:39.793 --> 24:42.444
Yeah, but I know
where your fingers've been.

24:42.441 --> 24:43.885
You sure. Yep.

24:45.972 --> 24:47.746
Here we are, girls.

24:47.739 --> 24:50.458
Ohh! Is that sauce homemade?

24:52.606 --> 24:54.255
Is that sauce homemade?

25:03.823 --> 25:05.006
Carl?

25:19.907 --> 25:23.195
If you don't fess up and get your
slag of a sister to tell the truth,

25:23.195 --> 25:26.039
I'll fucking kill ya.

25:26.033 --> 25:27.671
If I'm going down anyway,

25:27.665 --> 25:28.905
it might as well be
for something I did.

25:28.894 --> 25:30.464
it might as well be
for something I did.
Fuck you.

25:35.627 --> 25:37.117
You shouldn't have come back.

25:37.109 --> 25:39.543
Jimmy, no!

25:39.537 --> 25:41.539
Jimmy, in! No!

25:41.533 --> 25:42.067
Come on then!

25:41.533 --> 25:43.114
Come on then!
Leave it, leave it!

25:43.113 --> 25:43.863
Come on!

25:43.113 --> 25:45.149
You're dead, Gallagher.

25:45.145 --> 25:46.897
You're whole family
are fucking dead!

25:49.126 --> 25:53.256
I need this sorting, Mickey.
And quick. I want him out
of my life once and for all.

25:53.249 --> 25:55.524
And I don't care what it takes.

26:00.391 --> 26:03.246
One of your five a day.

26:03.237 --> 26:06.161
Two of your five a day.

26:06.153 --> 26:07.802
I heard you're infertile.

26:10.733 --> 26:12.360
You would've made a good dad.

26:18.630 --> 26:21.019
Sorry I snapped earlier. It's just...

26:21.013 --> 26:23.049
You took me by surprise.

26:23.046 --> 26:25.640
So you'll do it?

26:25.635 --> 26:30.914
Touched as I am by the Maguire
boys' generous donation...

26:30.905 --> 26:34.864
The only things that matter to me
are the things we share.

26:34.861 --> 26:37.318
It's what we're about, Shane.

26:37.317 --> 26:40.161
I don't want a baby unless it's
something we can do together.

26:40.157 --> 26:42.432
You could adopt.

26:42.424 --> 26:45.552
I wouldn't have
minded being adopted.
I mean, it's a bit late now.

26:45.551 --> 26:48.122
I'm way past the cute stage
and into the alarming

26:48.119 --> 26:51.384
potentially psychotic stage.
Which I'm not, by the way.

26:51.375 --> 26:53.775
But try telling that
to a prospective parent.

26:54.817 --> 26:57.752
He's got a point.
Think about it.

26:57.742 --> 26:59.619
What does Frank offer him and Stella?

26:59.611 --> 27:02.205
Where's their
positive male role model?

27:02.193 --> 27:04.172
Where's their Shane Maguire?

27:04.173 --> 27:06.198
Fuck, Kel, that's it.

27:06.188 --> 27:08.474
Hang on,
he only lives two doors away.

27:08.465 --> 27:12.856
No mum, dad AWOL, living in a pub.

27:12.855 --> 27:14.948
Katie.

27:14.945 --> 27:17.493
We could have her here.

27:17.487 --> 27:20.422
We'd give her everything that
Mandy would have wanted to.

27:20.413 --> 27:22.256
What do you think?

27:22.252 --> 27:25.324
Even if Lip agreed,
which he wouldn't,

27:25.316 --> 27:27.375
we'd never get past
the social workers.

27:29.051 --> 27:32.555
You're part of a gangster dynasty
stretching back to the potato famine

27:32.546 --> 27:35.026
and I earn me living flat on my back.

27:35.018 --> 27:38.795
Why don't you just do it? Don't tell
anyone, don't attract any attention.

27:38.785 --> 27:42.027
A bit more baby sitting.
Bit more picking up from school.

27:42.023 --> 27:45.333
Few more teas around at
Uncle Shane's and Auntie Kel's?

27:53.225 --> 27:54.886
Are you OK?

27:54.885 --> 27:56.807
Dead on my feet.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.928
New ward sister's
getting on my wick.

27:58.922 --> 28:02.710
She's only been there five minutes
and it's "Do this, do that."

28:02.705 --> 28:06.095
She seemed all right to me.

28:06.095 --> 28:09.314
When she rang.
She were worried you might be ill,

28:09.312 --> 28:14.102
seeing's how you haven't
turned up to work for two days and
you weren't answering your mobile.

28:14.099 --> 28:15.498
What's going on?

28:18.023 --> 28:19.058
Carl's back.

28:19.047 --> 28:20.503
What? When?

28:20.493 --> 28:22.097
Couple of days.

28:22.093 --> 28:24.573
Where is he?

28:24.565 --> 28:27.762
You know what, on second thoughts,
don't tell me, I don't want to know.

28:27.757 --> 28:30.669
He needed help.
I couldn't just leave him, could I?

28:30.661 --> 28:32.310
Why not?

28:32.309 --> 28:34.709
Because he's a mate.

28:36.501 --> 28:38.571
You're still in love with him.

28:38.561 --> 28:39.277
No, I'm not.

28:39.272 --> 28:40.864
Bollocks.

28:40.859 --> 28:42.998
I broke his heart to be with you.

28:42.989 --> 28:46.868
Yeah, and as soon as I can't satisfy
ya, you go running back to him.

28:46.860 --> 28:51.752
That's not fair. I care about
him the same way you should.

28:51.743 --> 28:54.246
He needs his brother, Ian.

29:00.348 --> 29:01.497
SHOUTING

29:01.495 --> 29:04.384
Gallagher. Come on, Carl.

29:06.661 --> 29:08.549
Gallagher get out here now!

29:12.115 --> 29:14.572
Going to fucking knock you out,
Carl Gallagher.

29:16.570 --> 29:17.525
Gallagher.

29:27.197 --> 29:29.074
You sure you want to do this?

29:30.981 --> 29:32.198
OK.

29:33.345 --> 29:35.916
You're rushing it.

29:35.910 --> 29:38.799
Just hold it steady.

29:38.797 --> 29:41.834
You've got all the time in the world.

29:41.830 --> 29:44.628
Just take it slowly,

29:44.625 --> 29:47.526
relax,

29:47.521 --> 29:48.977
cock,

29:50.799 --> 29:53.165
put your finger on the trigger

29:53.155 --> 29:59.663
and squeeze gently, really gently.

30:01.761 --> 30:04.468
Feel it?

30:04.462 --> 30:06.612
A bit more pressure and...

30:06.609 --> 30:07.610
GUN CLICKS

30:08.671 --> 30:11.697
Right. Where are the bullets?

30:11.686 --> 30:12.937
Carl. You sure?

30:12.931 --> 30:15.126
Have I got a choice?

30:15.117 --> 30:16.812
You could disappear again.

30:16.809 --> 30:19.004
It's not just about me
It's affecting everyone.

30:18.995 --> 30:19.711
Like me as well?

30:18.995 --> 30:20.212
Yeah Mickey, you as well.

30:20.206 --> 30:21.537
Yeah Mickey, you as well.
Let me do it.

30:21.529 --> 30:23.178
No.

30:34.477 --> 30:37.321
Wrap a towel round it.
It keeps the noise to a minimum.

30:37.315 --> 30:39.692
Yeah, get as close as you
can and aim for the chest.

30:39.693 --> 30:40.921
Fuck you doing?

30:40.916 --> 30:43.817
Fuck you doing?
Carl, you're a decent lad,
you don't do stuff like this.

30:43.808 --> 30:46.971
He's going after my family, Joe.
What am I supposed to do?

30:46.968 --> 30:49.755
Just sit tight, yeah?
It's fucking kicking off out there.

30:49.747 --> 30:52.352
Jimmy's mobs on the rampage.
You won't get close.

30:52.347 --> 30:55.020
You only get one pop, don't ya?

30:55.010 --> 30:57.581
You got to make sure
your timing's spot on.

31:00.858 --> 31:02.564
OK.

31:02.559 --> 31:04.618
But tomorrow he's dead.

31:18.325 --> 31:19.280
GALLAGHER!

31:37.473 --> 31:40.044
Your dad said you lot were
the only ones off limits.

31:40.042 --> 31:42.055
I'm glad you were listening.

31:51.723 --> 31:53.532
What you waiting for?

32:05.175 --> 32:08.531
Tell Carl if I can't get him,
I'll get his family instead.

32:08.526 --> 32:12.792
Liam. Ian. Shouldn't be too difficult
to find out where he lives.

32:12.786 --> 32:15.471
I'll pick them
fuckers off one by one.

32:15.468 --> 32:19.040
Starting with his dad.
I know exactly where he'll be.

32:20.877 --> 32:22.037
Let's go, boys!

32:43.873 --> 32:47.070
Well, you should take
it as a compliment.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.989
She's the finest MILF that
Chatsworth has to offer.

32:49.984 --> 32:51.724
You're staying the night.

32:51.722 --> 32:54.828
When I said MILF,
I wasn't actually suggesting...

32:54.819 --> 32:56.730
In your dreams, Frank.

32:58.444 --> 32:59.331
And stay up there.

32:59.321 --> 33:00.345
And stay up there.
Jamie?

33:00.339 --> 33:01.636
What's going on?

33:01.631 --> 33:04.919
Get hold of Libby and Patty and tell
them to stay put wherever they are.

33:04.919 --> 33:06.841
We've got problems.

33:06.833 --> 33:08.846
Jimmy.

33:08.845 --> 33:11.723
We? That's a Gallagher problem, son.
Not ours.

33:15.498 --> 33:17.898
Libby, it's Karen, Karen Maguire.

33:17.894 --> 33:19.338
Where are ya?

33:38.717 --> 33:40.139
Where's Carl?

33:42.468 --> 33:43.526
Gallaghers.

33:43.515 --> 33:44.948
Sit down! Sit down!

33:49.503 --> 33:51.733
They're not here.

33:59.318 --> 34:01.092
She said they're not here.

34:05.859 --> 34:07.212
There's more of us than you.

34:09.945 --> 34:12.869
It's not our fight. Unless you're
stupid enough to make it ours.

34:15.197 --> 34:15.982
Fuck off!

34:15.980 --> 34:18.141
Fuck off!
Go on, fuck off.

34:18.130 --> 34:20.042
You're all barred.

34:21.099 --> 34:25.058
Anyone sees Carl Gallagher,
he comes to me. You got it?

34:26.351 --> 34:28.263
Let's go, boys.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.641
You going to sort this or not?

34:34.639 --> 34:37.847
I took a bullet from a kid not much
older than him a few months back

34:37.838 --> 34:43.105
and if you think I'm going
risk taking another
for a Gallagher, think again.

34:43.105 --> 34:48.042
People are looking to you, Dad.
Waiting for you to stand.

34:48.034 --> 34:50.342
Then they'll be a long
time fuckin' waiting.

34:52.897 --> 34:56.549
Is this the kind of shit you want
for your son? Living like this?

34:57.641 --> 34:58.721
No.

34:58.713 --> 35:01.250
I need your help, mate.
You going to step up?

35:13.361 --> 35:15.556
Fucking brilliant(!)

35:31.467 --> 35:32.980
I want Jimmy.

35:34.564 --> 35:38.318
He needs to learn a lesson on
how things are done round here.

35:38.313 --> 35:39.678
Learn some manners.

35:39.669 --> 35:41.068
Fuck off.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.737
(GROANS)

35:44.727 --> 35:47.753
Like not speaking
until he's spoken to.

35:47.745 --> 35:49.474
Now we backed off at first

35:49.467 --> 35:55.212
because Jimmy's little problem
was his little problem.

35:56.781 --> 36:00.080
But then he made it ours.

36:00.079 --> 36:01.728
He got a bit too cocky.

36:06.271 --> 36:09.547
Now, you think you've got contacts.

36:09.541 --> 36:13.659
Make a call, your little
scally mates will be round

36:13.658 --> 36:16.274
as fast as their little BMXs
will carry them.

36:16.270 --> 36:18.431
You're fuck all
without your dad, anyway.

36:20.783 --> 36:23.069
Unfortunately for you...

36:25.437 --> 36:26.881
(WHISPERS) ..you're wrong.

36:30.035 --> 36:31.696
(GROANS)

36:31.690 --> 36:36.343
Now, you miserable bunch,
you need to learn respect.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.167
You've shown my family none.

36:40.819 --> 36:44.050
You've shown the people
of Chatsworth none.

36:44.041 --> 36:47.056
And that will not be tolerated.

36:48.622 --> 36:51.432
Not now.

36:51.431 --> 36:52.955
Not never.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.105
DOOR OPENS

36:55.099 --> 36:56.919
So give me Jimmy.

36:58.515 --> 37:00.164
Now.

37:07.115 --> 37:08.571
You heard the boy.

37:16.323 --> 37:18.348
Over to you, son.

37:19.753 --> 37:22.335
SPLASHING

37:29.165 --> 37:31.030
MACHINERY CLANKS

37:31.021 --> 37:33.797
SHOUTING AND GROANING

37:58.196 --> 38:00.289
You're with me now, mate.

38:00.287 --> 38:02.847
I've got this feeling
everything's going to be OK.

38:04.758 --> 38:07.318
I need to find Carl.

38:07.308 --> 38:08.821
He might need back-up.

38:08.813 --> 38:12.488
Carl'll be fine.
Take my word for it.

38:21.667 --> 38:24.101
You stick with me.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.223
I wanted to make sure you were OK.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.657
I wanted to make sure you were OK.
What the fuck do you care?

38:49.647 --> 38:51.478
There was trouble last night.

38:51.474 --> 38:54.671
There was trouble last week,
when I took a twatting for you.

38:54.669 --> 38:56.591
Didn't see you here then. Or maybe
it's not me you're interested in?

38:56.581 --> 38:58.515
Didn't see you here then. Or maybe
it's not me you're interested in?
Oh, grow up.

38:58.507 --> 39:00.327
I shouldn't have run. I know that.

39:00.317 --> 39:02.444
I wish I could change things,
but I can't.

39:02.439 --> 39:03.633
PHONE RINGS

39:03.629 --> 39:05.130
No. You can't.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.519
Just give him a chance.

39:06.509 --> 39:09.751
Please, Ian. Things can
go back to the way they were.

39:09.742 --> 39:10.948
No. They can't.

39:12.779 --> 39:15.225
Yeah, they can.

39:15.222 --> 39:16.166
What the fuck?!

39:16.161 --> 39:17.241
What are you doing?

39:17.241 --> 39:19.402
What I should have done at the start.

39:19.403 --> 39:22.884
No need. It's been sorted.
He wouldn't have done it anyway.

39:24.331 --> 39:26.526
You know what?

39:26.517 --> 39:28.917
Worst thing is, I would.

39:28.913 --> 39:31.620
To make up for the shit
that I put you through.

39:37.576 --> 39:41.763
Oh, yeah, that's right!
Run after him.

39:41.758 --> 39:43.202
I'm not running after him.

39:43.193 --> 39:44.672
I'm leaving.

39:46.788 --> 39:49.211
Max!

39:58.001 --> 40:00.276
My name's Carl Gallagher.

40:00.269 --> 40:01.839
Chesney Karib.

40:21.635 --> 40:23.671
Lip's getting married.

40:23.663 --> 40:27.053
He's got a degree,
a new job in London,

40:27.052 --> 40:31.250
a fiancee with a figure like
an hour glass, and a rich dad.

40:31.245 --> 40:34.169
Katie's going to live with him

40:34.161 --> 40:37.073
and he's going to be a proper
daddy to her. Great, isn't it?

40:41.363 --> 40:43.399
It's brilliant.

40:46.655 --> 40:51.160
Like shite it is.
But Katie looked so happy, son,

40:51.156 --> 40:56.605
and much as I wanted to,
I could hardly rip her away from
her dad's arms, could I?

40:56.597 --> 40:58.087
You did the right thing, Mam.

40:59.215 --> 41:00.295
Yeah.

41:00.287 --> 41:06.146
You're all right!
I was so worried.

41:06.139 --> 41:08.016
Couldn't sleep a wink at Lillian's.

41:08.011 --> 41:10.411
Stiff sheets? Funny shade of yellow?

41:10.407 --> 41:11.760
Yes!

41:11.759 --> 41:15.195
Lillian always gives
the incontinence room to visitors.

41:15.189 --> 41:17.589
Oh...

41:17.588 --> 41:19.692
Well, back in our own beds tonight.

41:19.687 --> 41:20.893
Own beds?

41:20.885 --> 41:23.968
Yeah, get back in your own room.

41:25.592 --> 41:26.991
Nice one.

41:26.981 --> 41:30.178
I'm getting off.

41:44.454 --> 41:46.319
Aren't you still a fugitive?

41:46.319 --> 41:48.355
Sammy's withdrawn her statement.

41:48.346 --> 41:50.200
What about the clothes
they found at Chesney's house?

41:50.197 --> 41:51.926
What about the clothes
they found at Chesney's house?
They were Jimmy's.

41:51.921 --> 41:55.834
Stupid git planted his own gear.
Got them to test the
bloodstained clothes,

41:55.832 --> 41:57.663
which proved they were his
and not Chesney's.

41:55.832 --> 42:00.189
which proved they were his
and not Chesney's.
Well, I'm glad you're home.

42:00.186 --> 42:01.699
Is he in?

42:01.690 --> 42:03.442
Liam?

42:03.441 --> 42:05.454
Carl, you're back.

42:05.454 --> 42:06.864
Long time no see.

42:06.859 --> 42:09.236
Have you trod in something?

42:09.234 --> 42:11.589
Oh, you're joking me!

42:11.582 --> 42:13.982
You're not coming in
until it's all off.

42:15.936 --> 42:17.619
Fancy a brew?

42:20.910 --> 42:22.855
You fucking bastard!

42:27.315 --> 42:30.284
Clumsy as ever, Mr Bolton?

42:30.285 --> 42:31.365
Why did you do it?

42:31.363 --> 42:32.625
Why did you do it?
Not now.

42:32.622 --> 42:34.419
Yes, now.

42:34.415 --> 42:36.815
Ian wants you back, Max.

42:36.809 --> 42:39.221
So do I.

42:39.219 --> 42:41.289
That's the problem.

42:41.279 --> 42:45.170
I'd always come between you,
and I don't want to.

42:45.164 --> 42:47.837
You were right to have the abortion.

42:49.783 --> 42:51.660
You and me with a kid?

42:51.649 --> 42:54.049
Could you imagine?

42:54.045 --> 42:57.014
See, you and Ian on the other hand,
I can see that.

42:57.011 --> 42:59.559
You love each other enough for that.

42:59.549 --> 43:03.189
If it was Ian's,
you wouldn't have got rid of it.

43:03.185 --> 43:05.972
And that bothers you, does it?
A big dent in your ego?

43:05.962 --> 43:08.362
No.

43:08.356 --> 43:10.756
You and me are just mates.

43:10.751 --> 43:12.059
You and Ian are soul mates.

43:30.393 --> 43:34.511
'I had the weirdest dream.
I was sat in the Jockey
