I mean, they're even better this way.

I totally agree. When it
congeals into one piece,

Where is he?

08:21.352 --> 08:22.792
Is he with that girl,

08:22.840 --> 08:24.658
the confident pizza chef?

08:24.709 --> 08:26.952
Um, I don't really know where he is.

08:26.977 --> 08:29.673
He's Dean. He's probably
at a yacht auction or something.

08:29.774 --> 08:32.488
A Yachtion. It's a word I just make up.

08:32.577 --> 08:34.647
[CHUCKLES] Amanda, by the way.

08:34.727 --> 08:36.837
Are you Dean's housekeeper
or something?

08:37.057 --> 08:38.514
No, I'm his brother.

08:38.549 --> 08:40.102
You're Dean's brother?

08:40.248 --> 08:41.289
Yes, I'm Dean's brother.

08:41.315 --> 08:43.182
My mom had an elective C-section,

08:43.207 --> 08:45.450
so I was born two weeks early.

08:45.475 --> 08:46.656
I could've used the whole nine months,

08:46.681 --> 08:48.102
obviously, that's what God
wants you to have,

08:48.127 --> 08:50.536
but she wanted to get back
to work, and now I'm this.

08:50.561 --> 08:52.079
Oh, you poor thing!

08:52.556 --> 08:55.079
If I just got one more week, man, woot!

08:55.385 --> 08:57.875
I'd be, like, 5'8",
running a hedge fund,

08:57.900 --> 09:00.024
just alpha-ing everybody around,

09:00.049 --> 09:01.808
throwing coffee at my assistant.

09:01.871 --> 09:03.137
It'd be awesome.

09:03.756 --> 09:06.160
You are so much funnier than Dean.

09:06.195 --> 09:10.064
Oh, thanks, you know,
I'm a comedic personality.

09:10.199 --> 09:11.432
That's amazing!

09:12.424 --> 09:14.317
I always thought comedians
were so brave.

09:14.342 --> 09:15.384
Oh, yeah, totally.

09:15.409 --> 09:18.303
Everyone's like Marines,
but it's comedians.

09:18.763 --> 09:20.408
Give me your phone.
I'll give you my number...

09:20.443 --> 09:22.004
in case you every need it.

09:22.331 --> 09:24.264
- You sure?
- Yeah.

09:25.415 --> 09:26.480
There's probably moisturizer

09:26.516 --> 09:28.039
and nail polish all over that phone

09:28.064 --> 09:30.092
from all the numbers
girls are giving me.

09:30.486 --> 09:33.353
You know, you're just another
girl giving me her phone number.

09:34.632 --> 09:36.410
Good night, sweet prince.

09:36.510 --> 09:39.478
I'm sorry I wasn't right
for you on the outside.

09:40.230 --> 09:41.363
It's over, Benji.

09:41.405 --> 09:44.168
The likes and comments
have stopped rolling in.

09:44.247 --> 09:47.094
Esther, Dean is really,
really out of your league.

09:47.131 --> 09:50.032
He dates girls right before
they marry Adam Levine.

09:50.542 --> 09:52.983
Are you saying I could
marry Adam Levine now?

09:53.016 --> 09:54.412
No, I'm saying people like you and me

09:54.437 --> 09:55.698
gotta know our place in the world.

09:55.723 --> 09:57.018
You can't just date anybody.

09:57.043 --> 09:58.801
Like, Amanda came by earlier
and gave me her number.

09:58.826 --> 10:00.514
That doesn't mean
I'm gonna ask her out.

10:00.539 --> 10:03.642
What? You have
Amanda's number?! Are you kidding me?

10:03.667 --> 10:05.860
I'm sitting here refreshing
my ass off for hours,

10:05.889 --> 10:07.635
and you finally tell me that?

10:07.661 --> 10:08.861
Come on, who cares?

10:08.886 --> 10:10.252
I mean, she's just messing with me.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.961
She laughed at my jokes,
but it's pretty obvious

10:11.986 --> 10:14.147
she just gave me her number to
try to get back at my brother.

10:14.172 --> 10:16.825
- Um, hello?
- Hello.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.604
So what, okay?

10:18.652 --> 10:20.235
Dude, don't you see?

10:20.260 --> 10:22.193
Amanda wants to be with you
to get to Dean.

10:22.218 --> 10:24.150
Dean wants to be with me
to get rid of Amanda.

10:24.175 --> 10:27.103
It's a win-win-win-win situation.

10:27.429 --> 10:30.128
Four wins. Four people can win.

10:30.875 --> 10:32.287
All right, I guess you're right.
I'll call her.

10:32.322 --> 10:35.813
Yay! Oh, my God, we haven't agreed
this much since we saw <i> Moana.</i>

10:35.839 --> 10:37.465
<i>Moana</i> was so good.
It's, like, the only time

10:37.490 --> 10:38.979
The Rock has ever been believable.

10:39.004 --> 10:41.840
I know, it was amazing. It's the
<i>Goodfellas</i> for our generation.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.121
Okay, so we gotta play this real smart.

10:44.146 --> 10:46.254
Like, we wanna rehearse.
We wanna know exactly

10:46.279 --> 10:48.742
what you're gonna say
to Amanda, word for word,

10:48.767 --> 10:50.561
- calculated, planned out.
- [RINGING]

10:50.586 --> 10:52.823
- I already dialed.
- No, stop!

10:52.848 --> 10:54.556
- It's ringing!
- Hang up! We're not ready!

10:54.581 --> 10:56.800
Hello, please hold for Mr. Benji.

10:56.914 --> 10:58.280
[SOFTLY] I forgot
your last name.

10:58.921 --> 11:00.888
Hey, what's up? Sorry, new assistant.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.663
Um, can you just hang on one sec?

11:02.740 --> 11:04.106
Sorry, one sec.

11:04.368 --> 11:07.128
I don't know. -Should I
invite her to minigolf?

11:07.338 --> 11:09.271
No. Do you want to sound like a psycho?

11:09.307 --> 11:11.014
Ask her if she wants
to try Zumba lessons.

11:11.039 --> 11:13.688
No, caricatures at the beach?
[FREAKING OUT]

11:13.713 --> 11:15.670
Um, so I was thinking
if you're not busy tonight,

11:15.695 --> 11:17.954
do you want to come over
for dinner? I can cook.

11:18.021 --> 11:20.188
Tonight? -Yeah, Dean is going
to that real estate gala.

11:21.134 --> 11:23.067
- He won't be here.
- The ball?

11:23.102 --> 11:24.546
- Oh, my, the ball.
- Oh, okay, yeah!

11:24.571 --> 11:26.537
Sweet. All right. See you then.

11:28.213 --> 11:30.090
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, wait.

11:30.196 --> 11:32.065
We need to do something
that will make Dean

11:32.090 --> 11:33.788
want to retaliate against her.

11:33.813 --> 11:35.820
- That's right.
- Nothing too violent.

11:35.915 --> 11:38.849
Not quite a felony,
but almost felonious.

11:39.657 --> 11:40.851
Yeah...

11:41.485 --> 11:42.720
I know what we can do.

11:42.755 --> 11:44.077
I feel so alive. I feel like

11:44.102 --> 11:45.546
a Bruce Springsteen song right now.

11:45.571 --> 11:48.375
I just feel, like...
Ow. I bit my tongue.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.748
It hurts really bad. It stings.

11:53.513 --> 11:57.265
Dude, okay, you know what? Your
stupid Instagram trick didn't work.

11:57.351 --> 11:58.804
Amanda just threw another one of these

11:58.829 --> 12:00.703
fat blue statues through my window.

12:00.728 --> 12:03.889
Someone threw a statue
through your window?

12:03.943 --> 12:08.879
Wow, that picture of Esther
must've really gotten to her.

12:08.915 --> 12:10.616
Why are you guys talking
like this now? What's the deal?

12:10.641 --> 12:13.679
Why are you guys talking
like that, like, "Oh!"

12:14.115 --> 12:16.570
That's weird. You know what,
it doesn't even matter, okay?

12:16.595 --> 12:18.323
You said it would work
and it didn't, okay?

12:18.348 --> 12:20.780
So stop playing puzzle
like you're sitting <i> shiva,</i>

12:20.805 --> 12:23.397
- and fix this!
- BENJI: Can I pitch you an idea?

12:23.504 --> 12:27.710
You should take Esther to the
LA Realtors Association event!

12:28.660 --> 12:30.102
Think about it, man.

12:30.182 --> 12:32.116
You're gonna go there with Esther,

12:32.141 --> 12:34.209
who's pretty much a wet baby hippo.

12:34.234 --> 12:35.651
It's gonna drive Amanda crazy.

12:35.687 --> 12:37.160
She's not gonna be
interested in you at all!

12:37.229 --> 12:40.056
- [LAUGHS]
- What? What's so funny?

12:40.081 --> 12:45.881
You want... You want me to take
Esther to my work event,

12:45.948 --> 12:48.588
okay, and have her stand next to me...

12:48.808 --> 12:51.413
So, like, my colleagues would see that?

12:51.547 --> 12:54.073
Bro, a Property Bro
is going to be there.

12:54.098 --> 12:56.300
The good-looking Property Bro
is going to be there.

12:56.325 --> 12:58.008
Come on, I read the invitation.

12:58.033 --> 13:00.061
It's gonna be passed apps.
He won't even notice Esther.

13:00.086 --> 13:02.696
You won't see me.
I'll be out of your way.

13:02.721 --> 13:04.847
It'll just be the hearsay
that I was there.

13:05.433 --> 13:08.287
Man, you know what,
Amanda is going to think

13:08.312 --> 13:11.219
I am disgusting, dude!

13:11.373 --> 13:13.473
Honestly, I'm a genius, man.

13:13.498 --> 13:14.597
This is great. Okay.

13:14.622 --> 13:17.167
Esther, I want you to get off your ass

13:17.192 --> 13:19.032
and we're gonna go shopping right now.

13:19.057 --> 13:21.313
- I could shop.
- Yeah, you can and you will.

13:21.338 --> 13:25.676
You're gonna dress not like
a fat kid on laundry day.

13:25.701 --> 13:27.601
Dude, you don't wanna try
crackers with honey?

13:27.626 --> 13:29.383
Shut up. Come on, let's go.

13:29.817 --> 13:31.784
It's our second date. Whoo!

13:33.681 --> 13:35.080
This is your day.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.048
You can date a tall hot guy.

13:41.535 --> 13:43.468
What do you think?

13:43.711 --> 13:45.548
Wow, I'm surprised
that actually fits you.

13:45.573 --> 13:48.904
Really? Oh, I usually shop
in the kids' section

13:48.929 --> 13:50.236
just 'cause it's more affordable

13:50.261 --> 13:52.442
and more flattering for my body type.

13:52.653 --> 13:54.937
You are going to be
the cutest flower girl.

13:54.962 --> 13:56.962
Aunt Debbie's going to be
so proud of you.

13:57.263 --> 13:59.972
Oh, you have a beautiful daughter!

14:01.602 --> 14:03.154
Hi.

14:03.627 --> 14:04.827
Esther, we have to go now.

14:04.852 --> 14:06.213
Okay, we can go.

14:06.599 --> 14:08.657
Um, just so you know,

14:08.716 --> 14:09.952
I'm gonna go rip the dress,

14:09.977 --> 14:12.145
and then I'm gonna tell them
there was some damage.

14:12.170 --> 14:13.831
- We'll get a discount.
- Nice.

14:13.856 --> 14:16.015
Usually girls want me to spend
more money on them, not less.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.932
I guess I'm not like most girls.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.858
No, you're not. Not at all.

14:23.743 --> 14:26.355
Oh, my God, it smells so good.

14:26.455 --> 14:29.712
Well, thank you. It's my Moroccan
grandmother's polenta recipe.

14:29.785 --> 14:33.140
Oh, you're really different from
most of the guys I go out with.

14:33.260 --> 14:35.543
You mean most guys
don't make you polenta

14:35.578 --> 14:38.546
with paprika so fresh that
it'll deviate your septum?

14:40.117 --> 14:43.551
Hmm. Speaking of most guys,
where is Dean tonight?

14:44.086 --> 14:46.000
He is, uh...

14:46.099 --> 14:49.962
I think he's doing a charity
basketball game with Macklemore.

14:50.049 --> 14:53.394
Hmm. So, can I help with anything?

14:54.219 --> 14:56.849
Uh, sure. You want to,
um, slice some tomatoes?

14:56.956 --> 14:58.265
- Oh, yeah.
- Cool.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.884
Oh, heirloom tomatoes are my favorite!

15:00.909 --> 15:02.368
They're in season right now, too.

15:02.404 --> 15:05.238
Let's just not use those.
Let's use canned tomatoes.

15:05.286 --> 15:09.188
Realtors Association Gala.
Is this where Dean is?

15:10.251 --> 15:12.371
Is he with that confident pizza chef?

15:12.478 --> 15:14.866
Oh, her, she's just... she's nobody.

15:14.891 --> 15:16.055
She's not a threat to you.

15:16.091 --> 15:18.136
She's just a loser. There's
nothing to be intimidated by.

15:18.161 --> 15:20.282
She's a walking
yeast infection. It's fine.

15:20.307 --> 15:22.174
You are just like your brother.

15:22.199 --> 15:24.430
- I'm nothing...
- All you guys do is lie.

15:24.455 --> 15:26.518
- Let's start over.
- I'm going to confront him.

15:26.678 --> 15:27.837
You don't gotta confront anybody.

15:27.862 --> 15:29.569
Come on, let's talk this through.

15:30.202 --> 15:31.797
You've gotta move on
from guys like Dean.

15:31.822 --> 15:33.789
Move on to someone who appreciates you

15:33.871 --> 15:35.898
and your art, you know?

15:37.220 --> 15:40.028
Come on, I've been caramelizing
onions for eight hours!

15:40.395 --> 15:43.420
I don't care how many Wheat
Thins I flush down the toilet.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.466
It's your old pipes. It's your problem.

15:45.786 --> 15:49.373
You hear me? And cut to me on my
birthday with a brand-new toilet.

15:49.546 --> 15:50.806
- Wow.
- I'm just saying.

15:52.173 --> 15:53.946
Oh, my God, boys, you keep me young.

15:53.978 --> 15:55.821
- You really do!
- I love that!

15:55.846 --> 15:58.312
- I just love that!
- All right, I gotta fill up

15:58.337 --> 15:59.948
the old gas tank with some spanakopita.

16:00.006 --> 16:03.447
Um, I'll let you guys talk
amongst yourselves, okay?

16:03.600 --> 16:04.794
- Okay!
- Yeah?

16:04.955 --> 16:08.023
[LAUGHS]
I love it! I love it!

16:08.634 --> 16:09.778
Dean, she's a firecracker!

16:09.803 --> 16:12.434
Why have you never introduced me
to this woman before?

16:12.641 --> 16:15.673
Yeah, it's weird. At first I
thought she was annoying, but...

16:16.186 --> 16:18.762
she kind of just laughs at all
my jokes, no matter what,

16:18.787 --> 16:19.796
and that's really cool for me

16:19.821 --> 16:21.716
'cause I'm trying to
work on my comedy...

16:21.882 --> 16:24.301
Dean? Did you want a... Dean?

16:24.348 --> 16:26.021
- Give me a second.
- Okay.

16:26.502 --> 16:28.469
- Dean, hi!
- Hey, what's up?

16:28.504 --> 16:30.309
How come you can't be
like this all the time?

16:30.346 --> 16:33.374
- What? Oh, did I do good?
- Yeah, you did pretty good.

16:33.476 --> 16:35.286
I think your friends are great.

16:35.311 --> 16:37.813
I hate that guy. He grew his
hair out long after I did.

16:37.838 --> 16:39.970
- Dean, Dean, Dean...
- What are you doing...?

16:39.995 --> 16:41.232
What are you doing here?

16:41.257 --> 16:42.615
I said that. You don't...

16:42.640 --> 16:44.473
Same. I said it, too. I'm sorry.

16:44.767 --> 16:48.011
So, Amanda was at our house
and I was cooking her dinner...

16:48.036 --> 16:50.798
Hold on a second.
You had a date with Amanda?

16:50.823 --> 16:54.186
It wasn't really a date.
It was part of our scheme!

16:54.319 --> 16:56.094
It was all in this together.

16:56.119 --> 16:58.165
Hold on, okay.
You don't actually believe

16:58.201 --> 17:00.167
that I'm that easy to be
manipulated, do you?

17:00.203 --> 17:02.169
Dean, you are way too handsome
to be manipulated.

17:02.205 --> 17:04.227
- That is not what this is...
- Oh, God!

17:04.252 --> 17:06.465
- No, no, no...
- That's obviously what this is.

17:06.491 --> 17:09.093
Listen up, guys. Amanda's
gonna be here any second.

17:09.117 --> 17:10.883
I didn't intend
for any of this to happen.

17:10.919 --> 17:11.996
You've dated everyone in LA.

17:12.021 --> 17:14.172
There's no way for us to not be
brothers and Eskimo brothers.

17:14.196 --> 17:16.067
- I'm sorry!
- She's crazy...

17:16.092 --> 17:17.092
I need to talk to you.

17:17.126 --> 17:18.423
- Hey.
- In private.

17:18.448 --> 17:20.781
Not so fast, Amanda, hi.

17:20.821 --> 17:22.569
Anything you want to say
to Dean tonight,

17:22.595 --> 17:23.928
you can say it in front of me

17:23.953 --> 17:26.094
because I'm his plus-one
and maybe more than that.

17:26.118 --> 17:27.624
You must be Esther.

17:27.648 --> 17:29.616
That's right, I am Esther.

17:29.865 --> 17:32.132
I knew you were confident
from Dean's photo,

17:32.157 --> 17:35.345
but the way you rock
that quinceaÃ±era dress

17:35.370 --> 17:36.596
in public proves it.

17:36.646 --> 17:39.975
Actually, thank you... Or <i> gracias.</i>

17:40.068 --> 17:41.916
Whatever you got to say,
just say it, go ahead.

17:41.951 --> 17:44.069
[SCOFFS] Fine.
What kind of monster

17:44.094 --> 17:46.176
sleeps with someone for three weeks

17:46.201 --> 17:48.335
and suddenly just doesn't
return their calls?

17:48.763 --> 17:51.258
I've been trying to contact you
for the last month.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.612
No, that's crazy. I...

17:53.637 --> 17:56.230
We had sex together ten times, tops.

17:56.690 --> 17:58.105
Okay, that barely warrants a call back.

17:58.130 --> 17:59.240
What do you think, we're married?

17:59.265 --> 18:00.331
That's really bad, Dean.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.448
In all fairness, a girl's never

18:01.473 --> 18:02.747
slept with me ten times.

18:02.772 --> 18:04.705
That's pretty much marriage for me.

18:04.775 --> 18:08.205
No. I told her... I told you I didn't
want to be in a relationship.

18:08.230 --> 18:11.901
You did not say that! You asked
me to pick you up at the airport.

18:11.973 --> 18:13.401
That's because I'm protesting Uber

18:13.426 --> 18:15.337
because you know what's been
happening with them lately.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.295
For real, any time you need
a ride to the airport,

18:17.320 --> 18:18.670
I will do it for you, I promise you.

18:18.695 --> 18:21.102
- Anytime, LaGuardia...
- I will never accept a ride

18:21.163 --> 18:23.197
from you ever. Ever!

18:23.222 --> 18:25.022
I want to say I'm sorry.

18:25.134 --> 18:26.525
I didn't know you weren't crazy.

18:26.550 --> 18:27.976
He made it seem like you were a nutbag.

18:28.001 --> 18:30.089
I would not have tried to
schtupp my brother's girlfriend.

18:30.114 --> 18:31.634
I didn't know you
were sleeping together.

18:31.659 --> 18:32.681
No, your brother

18:32.706 --> 18:36.240
was a total dick to me and
thought I would just go away,

18:36.340 --> 18:38.537
but I'm taking a stand so he
doesn't do this to the next girl.

18:38.562 --> 18:40.461
Okay, well, now you know she's lying,

18:40.497 --> 18:43.464
because no girl cares that much
about what other girls think.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.532
- I do sometimes.
- He makes a really good point

18:45.557 --> 18:47.872
because if you were
trying to make a feminist stand,

18:47.897 --> 18:50.164
then why'd you then
give him a statue as a gift?

18:50.289 --> 18:52.800
Since Dean clearly lacks
respect for women,

18:52.935 --> 18:55.117
I wanted him to have
a constant reminder

18:55.142 --> 18:57.232
of the eternal power
of the female form.

18:57.384 --> 18:58.705
That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.

18:58.730 --> 18:59.780
I don't even know what that means.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.995
- Let's go.
- I'll see you later.

19:01.020 --> 19:02.175
- Don't listen to her.
- Now!

19:02.848 --> 19:03.914
Can I talk to you?

19:04.084 --> 19:05.525
I'm just curious.

19:05.632 --> 19:08.366
Um, you can't entertain
a girl for one hour?

19:08.391 --> 19:10.299
I was up against impossible odds!

19:10.336 --> 19:11.325
- What?
- We're ugly people

19:11.350 --> 19:12.598
trying to sleep with pretty people.

19:12.623 --> 19:13.891
Do you think that's what Darwin wanted?

19:13.916 --> 19:15.883
We're gonna be their rebounds, okay?

19:15.942 --> 19:18.079
They're gonna fight, they're gonna
be sad, they're gonna be broken,

19:18.104 --> 19:20.368
and we're gonna swoop in
and pick up the pieces.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.556
Let's not let this plan go.

19:21.581 --> 19:23.614
Yeah. We can make it work.

19:23.790 --> 19:25.315
[CLATTERING]

19:25.715 --> 19:27.515
Well, of course
that's what's happening.

19:27.808 --> 19:28.841
[MOANING]

19:28.876 --> 19:30.142
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Oh...

19:30.167 --> 19:32.301
Earlier you requested
a personal tray of spanakopita.

19:32.359 --> 19:34.972
I'm so sorry, but you must have
me confused with someone else.

19:34.997 --> 19:37.619
Are you sure,
'cause I thought it was you.

19:37.644 --> 19:40.478
It wasn't me,
but I do think that I know

19:40.503 --> 19:42.425
who it was, and I can get that to her.

19:42.475 --> 19:44.152
- Well...
- Just hand it over.

19:44.177 --> 19:45.835
- Sure.
- Thank you.

19:45.860 --> 19:47.960
- Okay.
- Appreciate it. Thank you.

19:47.995 --> 19:51.730
- He knew you were lying.
- Whatever.

19:52.062 --> 19:54.558
I'm gonna take a hot bath
and listen to Britney.

19:54.583 --> 19:55.829
I just wanna wash my hands.

19:55.854 --> 19:57.921
I couldn't because I didn't want
the spray tan to come off.

19:57.998 --> 20:00.656
It's the white Jaguar,
and I know exactly

20:00.681 --> 20:02.474
how much change there
was in that cup holder,

20:02.499 --> 20:05.366
so don't be a bad <i> hombre, comprendito?</i>

20:05.485 --> 20:06.618
I'm not the valet, dude.

20:07.078 --> 20:09.078
We talked for, like,
30 minutes earlier.

20:09.103 --> 20:10.536
Remember, I told you that story...

20:10.561 --> 20:12.437
My mistake.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.324
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

20:14.977 --> 20:17.489
Thank you so much for getting
Dean and I back together.

20:17.514 --> 20:19.580
Sure, yeah, happy you guys are happy.

20:19.605 --> 20:21.809
Yeah. Can I ask you a question?

20:21.834 --> 20:24.594
- Sure.
- Is it more fun to be smart or pretty?

20:25.234 --> 20:26.679
You are so cute!

20:27.020 --> 20:28.874
Yeah. Can you answer the question?

20:29.573 --> 20:32.096
Um... smart?

20:32.326 --> 20:34.353
- Really?
- No.

20:34.378 --> 20:35.999
- Okay.
- Pretty.

20:36.023 --> 20:37.226
We're putting you on the spot.

20:37.251 --> 20:39.242
I'm sorry. It was
good to see you again.

20:39.267 --> 20:41.467
Oh, I'm actually seeing Dean
at your house tonight,

20:41.492 --> 20:43.574
- so I'll see you there.
- See you then!

20:46.084 --> 20:47.819
Oh, my God, I love her.

20:47.967 --> 20:50.134
Hear that? I would've
actually had a chance with her...

20:50.729 --> 20:52.729
What about me looks
like a valet parker?

20:52.754 --> 20:54.961
What are the visual cues
that I'm a valet parker?

20:54.986 --> 20:56.595
Am I wearing a red vest and a bowtie?

20:56.620 --> 20:58.377
Benji, you have a serviceman's face.

20:58.402 --> 21:01.628
It's not her fault.
It's not a bad thing, okay?

21:01.653 --> 21:03.456
- James Franco has it.
- And, of course,

21:03.481 --> 21:05.448
his Jaguar comes before my car.

21:07.460 --> 21:11.107
It's like I have the vibes of
someone you shouldn't respect.
