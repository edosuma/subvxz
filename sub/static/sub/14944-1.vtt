Twenty years ago,

00:30.656 --> 00:33.693
when the corporations
bailed out our
failed governments,

00:33.784 --> 00:36.491
they sold it to
us as salvation.

paid for that rescue

We have awakened
to the truth.

We have become slaves
to the Corporate Congress.

from this time and place,

00:55.431 --> 00:56.841
to friend and foe alike,

00:57.225 --> 01:00.638
that we have
passed the torch
to a new generation

unwilling to permit
the undoing of human
rights and dignities.

01:05.191 --> 01:07.807
And let every
corporation know,

01:07.902 --> 01:10.314
whether it wishes
us well or ill,

01:10.404 --> 01:13.692

you're under arrest.

Under section 76
of the Union Code,

01:42.019 --> 01:45.261
you are charged with
being the leader of
the terrorist group Liber8,

16:37.247 --> 16:40.205
Okay, wait.
Let’s figure this out,
okay? Meet me.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.328
No.
You’re going to need money.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.660
You’re going to need
a place to stay, right?

16:45.297 --> 16:47.754
That's the first
thing you've said
that does make sense.

16:47.841 --> 16:48.830
Good, then what
/ want you to...

16:48.967 --> 16:49.956
(DISCONNECTS)

16:50.343 --> 16:51.423
Hello?

17:18.788 --> 17:21.621
Am I the only one
to point out
the obvious here?

17:24.544 --> 17:25.954
Listen, Travis.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.632
Even ifwe manage to
make an impact in this time,

17:29.716 --> 17:34.335
there's still enough years
between now and the revolution
to turn it around.

17:34.429 --> 17:37.512
The revolution is on
our schedule, Kellog.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.303
The war begins now.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.595
Now, about me.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.436
Hello?

18:28.024 --> 18:29.480
Get out of my head, Alec.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.855
You can't shut me out.
I built the system
we're talking on, remember?

18:33.446 --> 18:36.233
But I understand
you think by telling
me what I'll become,

18:36.366 --> 18:37.606
it'l| create some
sort of paradox

18:37.701 --> 18:39.282
whereby my knowing,
it won't actually happen?

18:39.369 --> 18:40.779
But what you may not
know is that there are

18:40.870 --> 18:42.906
two schools of
quantum time travel theory.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.538
On the one hand,
you've already
changed the future

18:45.625 --> 18:46.660
by going back in time.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.208
The damage is done,
you can't stop
what's already been started.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.296
What's the other?

18:54.384 --> 18:57.091
That this journey is part
of your own time/ine
from the future.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.461
That is to say
that all these events
have actually happened before,

18:59.556 --> 19:02.218
and you're simply going
through the motions, again.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.102
Does that mean I'll
get back to my time?

19:08.231 --> 19:11.098
If that's what happens,
orhappened.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.270
It's a little confusing,
even for me.

19:14.404 --> 19:16.986
Or maybe you're just
some expert hacker thief
who stole all my research,

19:17.073 --> 19:19.280
and this is some
elaborate ruse.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.693
You're so pretty.

20:05.872 --> 20:06.952
What?

20:08.500 --> 20:09.831
Not cool.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.500
Turn it off, Alec.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.288
IS it off?

20:18.051 --> 20:19.632
Yeah, it's off.

20:23.890 --> 20:24.970
(SIGHS)

20:29.562 --> 20:30.847
(STATIC)

20:31.398 --> 20:32.433
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:32.524 --> 20:34.890
Something just happened.
I'm getting a lot
of interference.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.485
Relax. It's probably my CMR.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.822
CMR?
Cellular Memory Re view.

20:40.198 --> 20:43.486
I am outfitted with
a CMR bio-upgrade.

20:44.160 --> 20:49.700
A memory pack is
implanted into my skull
and records telemetry,

20:49.833 --> 20:51.494
video and audio to my cortex.

20:51.835 --> 20:55.419
It's to be used in
chain of evidence in trials.

20:55.672 --> 20:58.129
So no one needs to testify.
It's all recorded.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.456
Everything is on playback?

20:59.551 --> 21:03.669
I usually download everything
to the CPS server at
the end of the day.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.869
KIERA: (CHUCKLES)
Very funny, mister!

21:31.791 --> 21:34.032
You can have him
back when you're done.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.455
Soy-moo, again?

21:41.718 --> 21:44.130
Kiera. See you
after work, sweetheart.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.632
I'll meet you on the train.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.055
Kiera.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.257
Bye,Dad.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.565
How old is your son, Kiera?

22:04.073 --> 22:05.609
That's enough for tonight.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.912
Shit.

22:21.591 --> 22:22.922
(SNIFFLES)

22:29.182 --> 22:30.672

God damn.

(BEEPS)

24:13.453 --> 24:15.364
They catch an employee,

24:15.455 --> 24:17.411
they call him a rogue trader,
they throw him in jail.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.622
My son is right.
When the bank CEO does it,

24:19.709 --> 24:22.917
they bail him
out with our money.
How is that justice?

24:23.046 --> 24:24.377
(PANTING) Sorry.

24:24.756 --> 24:27.919
Alec, did you sleep
in the barn again
last night?

24:28.051 --> 24:29.882
Yeah, sorry. Big project.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.716
No need to be sorry.
This is my stepson, Alec.

24:34.724 --> 24:35.884
Why don't you join us?

24:37.393 --> 24:39.884
Um, maybe some other time.

24:40.396 --> 24:41.727
It was nice meeting you.
All of you.

24:41.898 --> 24:43.229
MAN: You too.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.731
Okay, uh... Long night.

24:45.818 --> 24:46.978
lthink I'm gonna
go grab a shower.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.317
Mmm-hmm.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.484

Not yet.

REPORTER: Good evening.

25:05.088 --> 25:07.329
Police in Portland are trying
to locate the shooter

25:07.423 --> 25:10.210
in a gang/and
slaying that took
the lives ofthree men

25:10.301 --> 25:12.257
in a brazen evening
attack last night.

25:12.345 --> 25:15.963

not surprised to
find them here.

REPORTER:
. . . describe automatic gunfire
from a black SUV

25:19.602 --> 25:21.968
as several patrons
were leaving the restaurant.

25:22.105 --> 25:24.767
Police have not released
the identity of the victims,

25:24.857 --> 25:28.099
but a spokesperson
said the gunmen were
known to police,

25:28.194 --> 25:30.810
and have ties to gang
activity in the area.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.607
(REPORTER
CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

26:05.356 --> 26:07.062
Can you believe this?

26:09.026 --> 26:10.061
What have you got?

26:10.486 --> 26:11.942
All signs point
to an explosion.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.610
But there are no
bomb fragments,

26:13.698 --> 26:17.156
no evidence of
combustible material,
no residue at all.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.451
How is that even possible?

26:20.538 --> 26:22.074
Yeah. Good question.

CARLOS: Do you recognize her?

26:23.416 --> 26:24.496
Not one of mine.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.661
Just give me a sec, huh?

26:27.670 --> 26:28.830
Excuse me.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.173
Can I help you?

26:31.674 --> 26:32.834
No, thank you.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.551
Uh, see, I don't think
you understand.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.921
This is a crime scene,
so I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

26:40.183 --> 26:41.298
You're law enforcement?

26:41.392 --> 26:43.053
Detective Carlos Fonnegra.
Special Investigations Unit.

26:43.186 --> 26:45.097
So ifyou could just...
You brought in
a suspect last night.

26:45.188 --> 26:47.725
Male. 30's. Red jumpsuit.
Probably intoxicated.

26:48.441 --> 26:49.681
We did.

26:49.859 --> 26:51.850
Are you suggesting
he has something to do
with this explosion?

26:51.944 --> 26:54.276
Yes. Did you bring in
any other suspects last night?

26:54.363 --> 26:55.648
No, just the one
you described.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.022
You saying he's
part of a gang?

26:57.116 --> 26:58.231
A very dangerous one.

26:58.743 --> 27:01.075
There are six others
headed somewhere this way.

27:01.204 --> 27:02.910
And I'm assuming
at least one of
them is injured.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.371
You know quite a bit
about this incident.

27:06.209 --> 27:07.699
What agency are you with?

27:09.086 --> 27:10.462
I'm, uh...

27:11.923 --> 27:13.163
lthink I'm
going to get going.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.872
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa!
Hey, come on.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.832
Anything you can add
to help lighten my workload

27:16.928 --> 27:19.089
would be greatly
appreciated, trust me.

27:19.222 --> 27:21.304
I'm sorry, I don't
want to get in trouble.

27:21.432 --> 27:23.514
And this isn't
myjurisdiction.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.683
Okay, look, this character
that we brought in last night,

27:25.770 --> 27:27.761
he's got no ID,
he's not telling
us his name.

27:27.897 --> 27:31.014
He doesn't show up in
any print or DNA databases.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.484
A little help would be nice.

27:36.739 --> 27:40.402
His name is Lucas Ingram,
and you won't find
him in any database.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.735
See? What else you got?

27:44.497 --> 27:46.158
I've said too much already.

27:47.458 --> 27:50.165
Okay, come on.
I think both of us
know that you're a cop.

27:50.253 --> 27:51.914
I don't know why you're
pretending not to be.

27:52.088 --> 27:53.703
Aren't we supposed to
be on the same side?

each other out?

28:07.061 --> 28:08.722
You know, you showing
up without approval

28:08.855 --> 28:10.561
could be quite
the political hot potato.

in a room with, uh...

28:19.824 --> 28:21.405
What's his name? Lucas Ingram.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.451

whether or not
you want to help me.

29:11.375 --> 29:12.831
Well, you seem to
have adjusted quickly.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.542

Probably doing things
they shouldn't be.

29:17.548 --> 29:18.663

are talking right now.

29:23.346 --> 29:25.962
Detective, could you
give us a minute?

29:26.349 --> 29:28.055
I think it might help.

29:42.865 --> 29:44.321

29:51.040 --> 29:52.155

up in the prison?

The device was smuggled in.

29:54.251 --> 29:55.411
You had someone
on the inside.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.710

You can't go back
and file a report.

back to 2077?

30:00.549 --> 30:03.837
You can't undo
what's been done.
We're here. We can't get back.

30:03.928 --> 30:04.963
You don't know that.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.670
Actually, before
Ijoined the movement
I was a SadTech engineer,

30:07.765 --> 30:09.551
so yes, I do.

30:10.685 --> 30:12.050
And let me be clear.

30:12.687 --> 30:14.894
This has always
been a one-way ticket.

30:18.901 --> 30:20.232
Look,

30:21.237 --> 30:23.023
with the knowledge you have,

30:23.698 --> 30:27.566
why don't you just
make some quick money
on the stock market or sports,

30:28.077 --> 30:31.365
buy an island
and just hide out
when shit hits the fan?

30:32.248 --> 30:35.740
Stay out of our way and
we'll leave you alone.

You're a Protector.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.626
Yeah, a Protector.

30:44.802 --> 30:45.962
Just a nobody cop.

30:47.263 --> 30:49.595
You, you're somebody.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.597
And I bet with the
right person and the
proper means to look,

30:55.730 --> 30:58.096
/ could find out
quite a bit about you.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.688
Is the right person me?

30:59.775 --> 31:01.231
Yes, I'm talking to you!

31:01.318 --> 31:03.024
What?
It is me!

31:03.112 --> 31:04.898
Okay, sweet,
what are we looking for?

31:07.074 --> 31:08.985
You were born Lucas Talbert.

31:09.452 --> 31:10.567
Talbert, got it.

31:10.661 --> 31:12.037
You took your
mother’s name, Ingram,

31:12.163 --> 31:13.573
when your father
went to prison.

31:14.665 --> 31:19.159
She was... Oh, correction.
She will be born in Victoria

a few years from now
to Kent and Mary-Lee Ingram.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.623
Mary-Lee Ingram, found her.

31:26.343 --> 31:27.924

31:28.596 --> 31:30.461
66 Beaconsfield Road.

31:30.931 --> 31:31.966
It's on a cul-de-sac.

31:33.309 --> 31:34.924
Last house on the right.

31:38.189 --> 31:39.679
That's the price of
being a famous terrorist.

31:39.982 --> 31:41.643
You wouldn't.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.266
Right before I
buy that island.

31:45.488 --> 31:46.819
Wait!

31:47.782 --> 31:49.272
I'll tell you what I know.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.825
What did you say to him?

31:53.954 --> 31:55.660
We talked about his future.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.364
My boss wants a word.

32:00.503 --> 32:03.666
So this Ingram
character is linked to
gang activity in Portland?

32:05.883 --> 32:08.716
Ijust spent
the better part of a decade
crushing the local gangs,

32:08.844 --> 32:11.256
and I'll be damned if
some Oregon startups
are going to come up here

32:11.347 --> 32:13.008
and make camp in my backyard.

32:13.516 --> 32:14.881
You understand me, Detective?

32:15.184 --> 32:16.390
Yes, sir.

32:17.019 --> 32:18.384
Then enlighten me.

32:21.524 --> 32:23.310
My hunch is they are
moving their territory north.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.518
They’re part of a larger gang.

32:27.655 --> 32:29.065
West Coast-based.

32:29.490 --> 32:30.855
Started in Portland.

32:31.659 --> 32:33.650
They will expand
rapidly by taking over

32:33.786 --> 32:35.822
other gang chapters
and affiliates.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.699
Did you guys
call in the Marines?

32:42.920 --> 32:44.080
Stay back, folks.

32:44.713 --> 32:48.581
You can expect
well-coordinated and
violent criminal activity.

32:52.388 --> 32:57.724
A ruthless disregard
for the law and some
unorthodox tactics.

33:02.189 --> 33:03.395

33:09.071 --> 33:10.186
So you're an expert?

33:10.281 --> 33:12.192

something like that?

33:13.075 --> 33:14.064
Something like that.

33:35.306 --> 33:37.638
Who's your direct supervisor?
Your lieutenant?

33:37.766 --> 33:39.267
My direct supervisor, sir?

33:39.476 --> 33:40.932
Who do you report to?

33:41.604 --> 33:44.437
I want to know who
to thank for setting up
a Portland-based operation

33:44.648 --> 33:46.764
in my precinct
without my authorization.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.447
Still waiting, Detective.

33:54.283 --> 33:55.272
(PHONE RINGS)

33:59.663 --> 34:00.743
Yeah.

34:02.124 --> 34:03.910
Put him through.

34:04.001 --> 34:05.411
Walt.

34:06.629 --> 34:08.790
Woah, woah, woah, slow down.

34:15.262 --> 34:16.672
Son of a bitch.

34:18.849 --> 34:20.464
I have two officers down.

34:20.601 --> 34:23.217
Their cruiser was stripped
of weapons and ammunition.

34:23.312 --> 34:24.301
Whatever you're
talking about...

34:24.396 --> 34:25.385
It already started.

34:27.441 --> 34:29.432
They're following
tactical protocols.

34:29.526 --> 34:31.517
Shelter, weapons, credits.

34:31.654 --> 34:33.190
Currency.
CARLOS: Money?
That's their plan?

34:33.322 --> 34:34.562
We got a half
a dozen bank alarms

34:34.698 --> 34:35.983
being triggered
all through the city.

34:36.158 --> 34:37.659
Is this in their playbook?

34:38.369 --> 34:39.484
It's a diversion.

34:39.620 --> 34:40.700
What?

34:40.829 --> 34:41.864
There's only one
bank being robbed.

34:42.289 --> 34:43.529
DILLON: And how the hell
do you know that?

34:43.666 --> 34:44.997
Focus on the
last alarm tripped.

34:46.502 --> 34:47.537
Why that one?

34:47.836 --> 34:50.168
Because they wouldn't move
until they had cover.

34:53.008 --> 34:53.997
Go.

Carlos, I need a weapon.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.731
No, what I need you
to do is stay back
and keep out of my way.

35:11.860 --> 35:14.522
Listen to me,
with guys like these
I need a weapon!

35:14.655 --> 35:15.861
Not a chance!

still out of the question?

Alec, listen,
no matter what
happens to me,

37:45.139 --> 37:47.846
you have to tell
people these guys are
going to start a war!

37:47.975 --> 37:49.181
No one is going to believe me.

they broke him out of holding.
He's gone.

I can get my
hands on right now.

some pretty crazy
shit back there.

for saving my ass?

Yes. Yes, you should.

I can't figure is

whether you just
like playing hero,

Thanks for everything today.

40:50.657 --> 40:51.692
Yeah.

41:02.044 --> 41:03.955
They didn't have to murder
those officers like that.

41:04.046 --> 41:07.163
They're soldiers,
starting a war that
they already lost once.

41:07.591 --> 41:09.502
So that's why
they were in prison.
'Cause they lost a war?

41:09.676 --> 41:10.961

assassinate the heads

41:12.888 --> 41:15.846
killing tens of
thousands of innocents
as collateral damage.

41:15.932 --> 41:18.389

do now, just pick up
where they left off?

Not if I can help it.

what happens. To me.

Forget it. You’re right.

know too much about

where you tell me
