WEBVTT

01:05.147 --> 01:06.941
Get away from me!

01:07.024 --> 01:08.776
Thorne is mine!

01:08.859 --> 01:10.611
<i>Previously on</i> Batman...

01:13.239 --> 01:14.282
Look out, Harvey!

01:16.659 --> 01:17.743
Harvey!

01:17.827 --> 01:20.746
Now, you understand,
there's going to be some scarring.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.674
Harvey...

02:01.495 --> 02:03.956
This is it.
Rupert Thorne's bookie joint.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.172
Good heads, we leave him alone.

02:12.214 --> 02:14.967
Bad heads, we hit him hard.

02:33.152 --> 02:34.362
Everybody, down!

02:36.614 --> 02:38.741
I said, down!

02:48.167 --> 02:51.045
Don't bother to adjust the picture.

02:51.128 --> 02:54.465
For the next five minutes,
I'm in control.

02:54.548 --> 02:55.925
Get the money.

03:05.309 --> 03:06.310
Hey, look at this.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.646
Must be
a couple of hundred silver dollars.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.147
Bring it.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.530
I'll take that.

03:17.613 --> 03:19.865
Jewelry wasn't part of the plan.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.576
- We gotta flip for it.
- What?

03:30.543 --> 03:32.378
Good side, leave it.

03:32.461 --> 03:33.838
But, Two-Face...

03:36.841 --> 03:38.342
I said leave it!

03:45.850 --> 03:50.646
Before I go, I want you all to give
Rupert Thorne a message for me.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.697
How much did he take me for this time?

04:00.281 --> 04:02.366
$200,000.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.118
I thought we got rid of this guy.

04:04.201 --> 04:06.287
Are you kidding? We created him.

04:07.955 --> 04:09.457
Six months of this is long enough!

04:09.540 --> 04:11.208
Spread the word.

04:11.292 --> 04:14.253
I'm putting out a contract. $1 million.

04:14.336 --> 04:16.881
No. Make it $2 million.

04:18.883 --> 04:23.137
A million dollars a face
to the man who brings me Two-Face.

04:32.605 --> 04:33.939
Harvey.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.163
Stay back!

04:53.501 --> 04:56.170
Harvey, please, let me help you.

04:57.087 --> 05:00.007
You... You saw what was happening.

05:00.090 --> 05:02.802
You knew something
was terribly wrong with me.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.595
I thought you were my friend.

05:04.678 --> 05:07.765
You should've been able to help me,
but you didn't.

05:09.308 --> 05:11.101
Now, look at me!

05:11.185 --> 05:12.770
But I tried, Harvey.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.733
Harvey!

05:17.858 --> 05:21.862
Why couldn't you save me?

05:31.121 --> 05:33.040
Why couldn't you save us, son?

05:55.479 --> 05:57.857
So what are you
dreaming tonight, Harvey?

05:58.607 --> 05:59.984
Peaceful dreams?

06:00.568 --> 06:01.652
Or nightmares?

06:01.902 --> 06:03.904
Maybe both at once.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.535
Sleep well, my friend.

06:09.618 --> 06:13.163
Wherever you are,
whatever you've become,

06:13.289 --> 06:15.624
I will save you.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.501
I swear.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.394
- Grace Lamont?
- Yes?

06:35.477 --> 06:37.771
I'm Detective Leopold.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.024
It's about your fiancÃ©.

06:42.902 --> 06:46.238
So, unless we can get to Harvey
before Thorne does,

06:46.322 --> 06:47.823
he won't stand much of a chance.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.034
I wish I could help,
but I haven't seen him

06:50.117 --> 06:52.036
since that horrible day in the hospital.

06:52.119 --> 06:54.663
I don't know where he is.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.625
It is possible
that Harvey might try to see you.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.336
If he does, you activate this beeper,

07:00.419 --> 07:04.006
and we'll be able to trace the signal
to wherever you are.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.098
It's all in your hands.

07:16.727 --> 07:19.188
All we have to do now is wait.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.565
What makes you so sure
Two-Face will come back here?

07:21.649 --> 07:25.027
He'll come back. They always come back.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.297
$64,800,

07:45.381 --> 07:48.842
$64,900, $65,000.

07:52.429 --> 07:55.933
You don't touch anything
until I tell you to, punk.

07:58.310 --> 08:01.855
You always were
a couple of greedy little beggars,

08:01.939 --> 08:05.776
even when I prosecuted you as DA.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.498
What are you looking at?

08:21.583 --> 08:24.837
Gee, Two-Face, if you miss her,
why don't you go see her?

08:24.920 --> 08:27.339
Sure, we could even bring her here,
if you want.

08:43.689 --> 08:46.358
Forget it.
We have more important things to do.

08:49.111 --> 08:52.156
I've decided it's time to finish Thorne

08:52.239 --> 08:53.699
once and for all.

08:53.782 --> 08:55.367
You're gonna knock him off?

08:55.451 --> 08:57.536
Let's just say, I'm gonna do to him

08:57.619 --> 09:00.414
exactly what he did to me.

09:05.794 --> 09:09.590
So you think you've discerned
a pattern to his crimes?

09:09.673 --> 09:12.051
Just look at the places
he's robbed, Alfred.

09:12.134 --> 09:17.181
Club 22, Gemini Jewelers,
the Two's Company Cafe.

09:17.264 --> 09:19.516
Two's? My word!

09:19.600 --> 09:22.352
Has anyone informed
the Second National Bank?

09:22.436 --> 09:23.604
That won't be a target.

09:23.687 --> 09:25.689
Every place Two-Face has robbed

09:25.773 --> 09:28.942
is also a front
for Rupert Thorne's criminal activities.

09:29.026 --> 09:32.738
Unfortunately, he's used up
all of Thorne's places.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.366
Perhaps, he'll rob them twice.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.327
A sort of double-or-nothing.

09:38.410 --> 09:41.830
No. I think Two-Face
is through humiliating Thorne.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.749
Now he wants him out of the way.

09:43.832 --> 09:45.501
And I think I know how.

09:56.470 --> 09:59.973
Keep your guard up, sir.
Harvey is no longer the fellow we knew.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.643
I still feel that
somewhere inside that monster

10:02.726 --> 10:04.311
is my old friend.

10:04.394 --> 10:07.564
That may make him even more dangerous.

10:44.309 --> 10:45.686
Hey, this looks like something.

10:45.769 --> 10:48.605
"Rupert Thorne. Confidential."

10:51.483 --> 10:53.610
For years, I tried to subpoena this.

10:53.735 --> 10:58.198
"Money laundering, payoffs, blackmail."
It's all here.

11:00.033 --> 11:02.327
I'II destroy Thorne with his file

11:02.494 --> 11:04.163
just like he destroyed me with mine!

11:04.746 --> 11:06.456
Come on, let's get out of here.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.059
You're coming with me, Harvey.

11:29.396 --> 11:30.898
I want to help you.

11:30.981 --> 11:34.651
Help me? You don't know
anything about me.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.820
I know that you have friends, Harvey.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.822
Friends who love and care about you.

11:39.489 --> 11:41.950
Harvey's friends are no friends of mine.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.369
What about Grace?

11:44.453 --> 11:45.621
Grace?

11:47.289 --> 11:48.749
What do you know about Grace?

11:48.832 --> 11:52.502
She still loves you, Harvey.
She keeps your picture.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.796
Every day, she waits and prays.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.506
She wants you back, Harv.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.508
Hey, what's taking you guys-

11:58.592 --> 11:59.927
Holy...

12:07.017 --> 12:09.102
Come on, let's get out of here!

12:11.688 --> 12:13.941
No, Harvey. Wait.

12:18.737 --> 12:19.738
Let go of me!

12:32.042 --> 12:35.087
Hey, there. You okay, Batman?

12:35.170 --> 12:37.965
Looks like you took
a nasty fall there, fellow.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.718
Harvey! Where's Harvey?

12:41.927 --> 12:43.595
Ain't nobody here but us, son.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.060
- You all right?
- Yeah.

12:50.644 --> 12:51.853
I'm fine.

13:05.742 --> 13:08.161
Wait till the police
get a load of this stuff.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.414
It's even got his Swiss bank accounts.

13:25.721 --> 13:26.763
Stop the car!

13:37.441 --> 13:39.735
- Hello?
<i>- Grace?</i>

13:39.818 --> 13:40.944
Harvey?

13:41.445 --> 13:43.989
<i>- Whm an you?
All!</i>

13:45.032 --> 13:46.199
I wanna see you.

13:46.283 --> 13:49.369
Yes! Yes, of course, darling. Where?

13:49.453 --> 13:50.996
<i>Look out your window.</i>

13:54.166 --> 13:56.168
<i>They'll bring you to me.</i>

14:02.007 --> 14:05.927
Harvey, you know
that no matter what, I love you.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.388
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

14:10.432 --> 14:12.059
He did What?

14:18.774 --> 14:21.902
If he gives those files
to the police, I'm ruined!

14:21.985 --> 14:24.029
We've got to stop him now!

14:34.289 --> 14:37.042
Grab your hat, Rupie,
and your checkbook.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.586
Tonight may be our lucky night.

15:01.441 --> 15:02.818
This way, ma'am.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.408
In there.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.008
Hello, Grace.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.636
Harvey.

15:33.682 --> 15:36.309
My name is Two-Face now.

15:36.393 --> 15:37.727
No, Harvey.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.438
This is my world now.

15:40.147 --> 15:43.608
A dichotomy of order and chaos...

15:43.692 --> 15:45.277
Just like me.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.988
Harvey, what's happened to your mind?

15:48.071 --> 15:51.032
Your feelings?
You used to listen to your feelings.

15:51.116 --> 15:54.411
This is what I listen to now.

16:02.627 --> 16:04.963
Chance, Grace.

16:05.046 --> 16:06.673
Chance is everything.

16:06.756 --> 16:10.969
Whether you're born or not,
whether you live or die,

16:11.052 --> 16:12.929
whether you're good or bad,

16:14.055 --> 16:16.183
it's all arbitrary.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.934
That's nonsense, Harvey.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.854
Was it chance
that made you District Attorney?

16:20.979 --> 16:23.023
Was it chance
that made you fall in love with me?

16:23.106 --> 16:25.734
Take control of your life, Harvey.

16:25.817 --> 16:27.277
You don't need a coin.

16:28.111 --> 16:29.404
And you don't need this.

16:32.407 --> 16:34.868
You don't ever need to hide from me.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.134
- I love you.
- Grace.

16:52.969 --> 16:53.970
What is it?

17:05.649 --> 17:07.400
At last we meet,

17:07.734 --> 17:13.698
face to face... To face.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.116
You!

17:23.208 --> 17:25.669
You did very well,
leading us to your boyfriend.

17:27.128 --> 17:28.213
Grace?

17:28.296 --> 17:32.092
Now, now, she thought
she was alerting the police.

17:32.175 --> 17:34.427
She wanted to save you.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.638
I'm so sorry, Harvey.

17:40.767 --> 17:43.019
So much for control, huh, Grace?

18:14.384 --> 18:15.844
It ain't here, boss.

18:15.927 --> 18:18.471
That file is here, all right.
Now, where is it?

18:18.555 --> 18:21.558
Not a chance, you slime!

18:26.646 --> 18:29.482
Such a pretty face, Harvey.

18:29.566 --> 18:32.152
- Let her go!
- Give me the file.

18:52.839 --> 18:55.675
- Get rid of them.
- But you said...

18:56.301 --> 18:58.511
Your boyfriend first.

19:10.231 --> 19:11.232
Batman!

19:12.609 --> 19:14.903
This is the last time
you interfere with me.

20:17.882 --> 20:19.884
No! Two-Face, don't!

20:19.968 --> 20:21.886
- You can't let him.
- Harvey!

20:21.970 --> 20:25.390
- What are you doing?
- Taking control of my life.

20:25.473 --> 20:26.975
Let the law handle it.

20:27.058 --> 20:28.518
The law?

20:28.601 --> 20:31.980
Here's the only law!
The law of averages,

20:32.105 --> 20:33.898
the great equalizer.

20:48.079 --> 20:50.665
No! What have you done?

20:50.749 --> 20:52.709
My coin, where is it?

20:52.792 --> 20:55.003
I can't decide without...

20:55.086 --> 20:58.131
Oh, no! It's got to be here!
It's got to!

20:59.299 --> 21:00.842
I have to have it!

21:10.101 --> 21:13.605
It's all right now, Harvey. I'm here.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.329
Poor Harvey. So filled with anger.

21:29.412 --> 21:30.705
Do you think there's any hope?

21:30.789 --> 21:34.542
Where there's love,
there's hope, Commissioner.

21:38.755 --> 21:41.090
Well, a little luck wouldn't hurt.

21:45.553 --> 21:47.514
For you, Harvey.

22:27.804 --> 22:28.805
English - SDH
