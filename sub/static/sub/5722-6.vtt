out of Berlin Station.

00:23.233 --> 00:24.401
So there was something in
the additional documents

00:24.468 --> 00:26.235
the SVR didn't
want you to see.

00:26.303 --> 00:29.071

material he got from the CIA.

00:29.139 --> 00:30.406

05:45.246 --> 05:46.946
It was the Russians
who did it.

05:47.015 --> 05:48.681
That is confirmed.
They used your operation

05:48.749 --> 05:50.249

05:50.317 --> 05:51.783

it wasn't meant for During;
it was for <i>me.</i>

05:58.458 --> 06:00.692
Want to tell me
why the Russians give a shit

06:00.760 --> 06:02.161
whether you're alive or dead?

06:03.930 --> 06:06.381
Because they don't want me to
see something in the documents

06:06.459 --> 06:08.381
those hackers stole from you.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.367

06:15.349 --> 06:16.390
I don't know.

06:17.786 --> 06:20.192
Which is why you need
to get the documents for me.

06:20.227 --> 06:22.042
Ah.

06:22.109 --> 06:23.443
Right now, they think I'm dead--

06:23.510 --> 06:24.744
Quinn made it look
like you killed me--

06:24.812 --> 06:26.579
- so there is a window.
- You want me

06:26.647 --> 06:28.848

06:28.916 --> 06:31.050

might cause some problems?

06:34.054 --> 06:36.688
You've already got problems.

that we're meeting like this

- instead of me just knocking
on your hotel door? - I don't know.

06:46.599 --> 06:49.534
Maybe because you knew
I wouldn't answer it.

06:52.272 --> 06:55.574
There's a line between us
that you drew.

06:55.642 --> 06:57.309
Forget that.

Look, you've been sitting here
thinking about this.

14:13.733 --> 14:15.434
I-I just walked
through the door.

14:15.502 --> 14:17.804
Please, give me some time.

14:27.948 --> 14:32.051
I just talked to Saul. I thought
he would help me, but he won't.

14:32.119 --> 14:34.120
He won't help me find
those documents.

14:34.188 --> 14:37.456
Shut up about these documents!
About these...

14:37.524 --> 14:39.458
Man, who cares about
these goddamn documents?

14:39.526 --> 14:41.259
Quinn walked out that
door bleeding to death

14:41.328 --> 14:44.095

Called a sweep.

On what authority?

16:17.253 --> 16:18.954
On the authority of someone
blew up our goddamn plane.

16:19.022 --> 16:20.755
Believe me,
I'm aware.

16:20.823 --> 16:22.857
You want to tell me why you
didn't order a sweep yourself?

16:22.926 --> 16:24.559
I mean, if you're interested
in who actually did it,

16:24.627 --> 16:26.861
- who got their nose inside our tent.
- What the hell's

16:26.930 --> 16:28.563

- You having me tailed?

16:28.631 --> 16:30.165

- You having anyone else

16:30.233 --> 16:31.766
- in this office tailed?
- What do you mean?

16:31.834 --> 16:33.735
Do not give me one more
of your fuckwit non-answers,

16:33.803 --> 16:36.004
Dar, 'cause I'm this close, this
close to taking your head off.

16:36.072 --> 16:39.041
- You are? - I know what this
is about. You think I don't?

16:39.108 --> 16:41.708
30 years ago, 30 years,
I leaked three names to Mossad,

16:41.776 --> 16:43.710
three terrorist names,
during a desperate time,

16:43.778 --> 16:45.413
the Inti-fucking-fada.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.748
My mistake. I paid
for it. You hang on

16:47.816 --> 16:50.418

16:51.519 --> 16:53.421

16:53.488 --> 16:56.424
It's not the Israelis
and it's not me.

You went to him,

they weren't involved.

17:01.863 --> 17:03.729
Then how did he explain being
in Geneva

17:03.797 --> 17:06.266
at the exact moment
our jet blew up there?

17:06.334 --> 17:09.069
- You want to tell me that?
- You need to get your head out of your ass

17:09.136 --> 17:10.502
about the goddamn Israelis.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.305
Why? Because you say so?

17:12.373 --> 17:15.108
No. 'Cause it was the Russians.

17:15.175 --> 17:17.844
(muffled): Uh-huh, the Russians
who have been propping up Assad

17:17.911 --> 17:21.013
for the past five years, they've
gotten inside our station here.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.782
- That's who blew up our plane.
- How do you know that?

17:23.851 --> 17:27.119
SAUL (muffled): - I just fucking do.
- You tipped off

17:27.188 --> 17:28.588
your Israeli friend,

17:28.655 --> 17:30.190
you're screwing your coworker,

17:30.257 --> 17:32.558

17:40.834 --> 17:42.101
Fuck you.

17:42.168 --> 17:44.837
No. Fuck you.

Oh, Christ.

17:48.809 --> 17:50.943
What you've been up to,
he can figure out.

17:51.011 --> 17:53.345
- All he'll do is get me
shipped back to Langley. - Good.

17:53.413 --> 17:56.248
I'll be cross-examined for
six months when I'm needed here.

17:56.316 --> 17:57.483

30:41.962 --> 30:44.797
He's too sick
to go anywhere.

30:44.865 --> 30:47.299
- He was walking in the hall.
- And now his stitches are bleeding.

30:47.367 --> 30:49.301
MAN: He's not as
sick as you say.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.103
It's all right, Hussein.

30:54.089 --> 30:55.874

31:16.061 --> 31:18.430
(exhales)

31:32.711 --> 31:35.313
You are an American.

31:38.049 --> 31:39.483
A spy.

31:39.551 --> 31:41.419
He's my patient and
a guest in my home.

31:41.486 --> 31:43.454
- A spy is not a guest.
- He's not a spy.

31:43.522 --> 31:44.755
He asked me
to warn you

31:44.823 --> 31:45.987
you were talking too loud.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.224
_

31:47.225 --> 31:49.193
(Hussein protests)

31:54.264 --> 31:55.832
This <i>kuffar</i>

31:55.899 --> 31:58.435
heard our plans
of our attack here.

31:58.502 --> 32:00.470
I only heard a few words.

32:00.538 --> 32:02.572
It didn't make sense.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.041
Now that I know,
it really doesn't make sense.

32:05.042 --> 32:08.077
_

32:08.078 --> 32:10.413
- Why doesn't it make sense?
- He's just out of prison.

32:10.481 --> 32:12.749
You think they're not gonna
have him under surveillance?

32:12.817 --> 32:15.251
You try another attack now,
you'll all be arrested

32:15.319 --> 32:17.220
or imprisoned,
this time for life.

32:19.122 --> 32:21.057
Unless...

32:21.124 --> 32:23.993
getting arrested is the point.

32:24.061 --> 32:28.831
The real jihad
is in Syria.

32:28.898 --> 32:30.766
But there you'd have to fight.

32:31.601 --> 32:32.200
(shouts)

32:32.268 --> 32:34.837
(panting)

32:38.375 --> 32:40.909
(panting)

32:40.977 --> 32:44.346
Look, I understand you not
wanting to go is all I'm saying.

32:44.414 --> 32:46.749
I've seen enough of Syria
to know.

32:46.816 --> 32:49.084
I'm a walking

32:49.151 --> 32:51.353
staph infection.
I need to go.

32:51.421 --> 32:54.089
So you follow me, kill me,
do whatever you need to do.

32:54.156 --> 32:56.091
Just make sure
the police aren't watching.

32:56.158 --> 32:58.093
Don't make a mess.

32:58.160 --> 33:01.397
I'm a guest here.

33:13.509 --> 33:16.111
- What is it?
- Those documents that were taken before,

33:16.178 --> 33:18.113
they got taken again.
Saul Berenson accessed them

33:18.180 --> 33:20.115
- from my terminal.
- Almost 20 minutes ago.

33:20.182 --> 33:22.050
- I had to verify what was taken.
- Jesus Christ.

33:22.118 --> 33:23.985
I wasn't clear on his status,
if there's some kind

33:24.053 --> 33:25.987
of cloud. I...

33:29.791 --> 33:33.160
Where's Saul? I was told
he just blew off the polygraph.

33:33.228 --> 33:36.163
Not just. He left the office with
a copy of the breach documents.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.732
Well, there's a team on him.
He shouldn't be hard to find.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.968
He slipped them already
and powered off his cell.

33:41.036 --> 33:45.072
You're fucking him. You must
have a way to get in touch.

33:48.977 --> 33:51.312
(phone ringing)

33:55.282 --> 33:57.784
Did the sweep turn up anything?

33:57.852 --> 33:59.886
You have to come back in, Saul.

34:00.988 --> 34:02.923
So nothing at all?

34:02.990 --> 34:05.492
Nobody's really been thinking
much about bugs

34:05.560 --> 34:06.960
since you took the documents
and ran.

34:07.027 --> 34:09.161
Did you hear me?

34:09.228 --> 34:10.831
Yeah.

34:10.898 --> 34:13.099
This is serious.

34:13.167 --> 34:14.868
Come back in.

34:14.936 --> 34:18.804
I can square things with Dar.
We can work him together.

34:18.871 --> 34:21.139
He's only making an issue of
this because you won't tell him

34:21.208 --> 34:22.641
what's really going on.

34:22.708 --> 34:24.409
(whispering):
We got a fix on his location.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.645
(whispering): - Pick him up.
ALLISON: - What is it, Saul?

34:26.713 --> 34:28.147
What's so important

34:28.215 --> 34:29.715
you had to steal the documents?

34:29.783 --> 34:31.583
Is there something
in there we missed?

34:31.650 --> 34:33.585
Is he listening?

34:33.652 --> 34:35.955
- Who?
SAUL: - Who do you think?

34:36.023 --> 34:36.956
Is he there with you?

34:37.023 --> 34:39.891
Yes.

34:39.958 --> 34:43.328
Dar, it's what
I already told you.

34:43.396 --> 34:45.763
Russians.

34:45.831 --> 34:47.099
Give me that.

34:48.266 --> 34:49.701
(quiet chatter)

34:49.768 --> 34:50.469
Saul?

34:51.603 --> 34:52.937
Saul!

34:59.344 --> 35:01.112
Are you expected? I'll direct
you to the table, sir?

35:01.179 --> 35:02.514
- Yes.
- With me.

35:04.116 --> 35:05.850
I want to talk to you
about Carrie Mathison.

35:05.918 --> 35:08.285
MAN: This gentleman says
you're expecting him?

35:08.353 --> 35:10.688
That's okay, Martin.

35:16.028 --> 35:17.829
I don't have much time.
I'm expecting someone.

35:17.897 --> 35:19.831
So am I, so what you need
to do is listen.

35:22.100 --> 35:23.467
Carrie came to me for help,

35:23.535 --> 35:25.436
asked me to bring her
some classified files.

35:25.504 --> 35:26.870
I refused.

35:26.938 --> 35:28.472
Not just because it's my job.

35:28.540 --> 35:30.474
I didn't trust her.

35:30.542 --> 35:33.777
Because of you,
for one thing, but...

35:33.845 --> 35:36.347
(breathing loudly)

35:36.415 --> 35:38.949
Anyway, I didn't believe her.
Now I do.

35:39.017 --> 35:41.552
I need you
to give her something for me.

35:41.619 --> 35:44.788
What makes you think
I'm even in contact with her?

35:44.856 --> 35:46.990
You're saying you're not?

35:47.059 --> 35:49.160
'Cause we don't have much time.

35:51.563 --> 35:53.663
I'm talking about classified
material, for Carrie's eyes

35:53.730 --> 35:55.998
alone, not for you, not for your
people, not to tweet or post

35:56.067 --> 35:58.435
on your Web site. Carrie only.
Do you understand that?

35:58.502 --> 36:00.570
Do you?

36:03.807 --> 36:06.509
MARTIN: Herr During, these men
won't identify themselves.

36:06.577 --> 36:07.910
- We're investigating a terrorist act.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen...

36:07.978 --> 36:09.245
- Sit down.
- Wait. You're in Germany.

36:09.313 --> 36:11.681
This is my club,
and this man is my guest.

36:11.748 --> 36:14.384
- You have no authority here.
- Did he give you anything?

36:14.452 --> 36:16.186
- What are you talking about?
- Give it to us

36:16.253 --> 36:17.853
now, and we'll
leave you in peace.

36:17.921 --> 36:20.122
He didn't give me anything.

36:20.190 --> 36:22.891
We'll need
to search you.

36:22.959 --> 36:25.060
Sir.

36:25.228 --> 36:29.198
Excuse me. These men
are with the CIA.

36:29.265 --> 36:31.166
They won't say that.

36:31.234 --> 36:33.968
They won't say who they are,
or what they're looking for.

36:34.036 --> 36:35.537
They just come in,
search my guest,

36:35.605 --> 36:37.172
and now they want
to search me.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.174
And you know what?

36:39.242 --> 36:41.276
I'll agree.

36:41.344 --> 36:43.478
On the condition
that you apologize

36:43.546 --> 36:45.847
to everyone in this room
when you don't find

36:45.915 --> 36:48.183
- what you're looking for.
- Whatever you say. (snaps fingers)

37:11.340 --> 37:13.006
Let's take him out of here.

37:15.176 --> 37:18.212
We had an agreement, sir.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.848
Sorry for the inconvenience.

38:51.137 --> 38:53.238
You are not well enough
to leave.

38:53.306 --> 38:56.007
I will talk
to that crazy man.

38:56.075 --> 38:58.310
You should stay,
at least one more night.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.345
I'll sleep outside the door.

39:00.412 --> 39:02.747

for taking care of me.

You have somewhere
to go, I hope?

after you?

You here to stop me?

not a spy.

39:29.608 --> 39:32.343

39:32.410 --> 39:36.680
Hajik... wants
to execute you.

No one supports him.

You work for him.

A mercenary.
