WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.872
<i>Previously on "Ascension"...</i>

00:02.873 --> 00:05.944
As far as the crew believe, they're
halfway through a 100-year journey.

00:05.945 --> 00:08.524
- And one of them is a murderer.
- <i>I don't think Stokes did it.</i>

00:08.525 --> 00:11.265
<i>What if the saboteurs have
been around longer than we've suspected.</i>

00:11.266 --> 00:14.201
If Lorelei made the same connection,
it might be why she died.

00:14.202 --> 00:16.379
<i>(Krueger): You have
someone inside Ascension.</i>

00:16.379 --> 00:19.292
You have a
wild imagination.

00:19.713 --> 00:21.920
<i>Sex is the true
currency here on this ship.</i>

00:21.921 --> 00:24.252
Don't undermine me
with my girls, Will.

00:24.253 --> 00:27.248
<i>(Denninger): And Rose?</i>
- He's got to someone in your inner circle.

00:27.249 --> 00:28.808
<i>Can you uncover his spy?</i>

00:28.981 --> 00:31.504
Your life and the
life of this project

00:31.505 --> 00:32.805
have the same expectancy.

00:32.845 --> 00:35.106
<i>(Krueger): I'm not just there
To investigate a murder, am I?</i>

00:35.107 --> 00:37.728
He's hiding something and
TC wants to know what that is.

00:37.729 --> 00:38.857
Experiments?

00:38.955 --> 00:40.922
<i>She's what we've been
working towards, isn't she.</i>

00:40.923 --> 00:42.665
<i>She's the best
chance we have.</i>

00:43.195 --> 00:44.771
I'm scared.

00:44.772 --> 00:47.527
This whole project is
one big lie told to 600 people.

00:47.528 --> 00:50.734
I can get tissue samples from their living
relatives, then we can test their DNA.

00:50.735 --> 00:52.292
<i>(Krueger): There's no way
I can't get to them.</i>

00:52.293 --> 00:55.182
Let me out!

00:57.520 --> 01:00.016
(♪ Jazz ♪)

01:05.458 --> 01:08.301
Excuse me!

01:08.504 --> 01:10.059
I didn't think
it could be possible

01:10.060 --> 01:12.661
to top last year's Ostara,
but you have done it.

01:12.732 --> 01:13.771
(chuckling)

01:13.833 --> 01:15.934
So many eager faces.

01:15.935 --> 01:18.337
They spend the year hoping
and praying they'll be chosen

01:18.338 --> 01:19.604
to have a child.

01:19.605 --> 01:21.740
Tonight they find out
if they won the lottery.

01:21.741 --> 01:24.476
Those who aren't chosen,
you think they'll blame you?

01:24.477 --> 01:26.244
There's always
a few who feel

01:26.245 --> 01:28.747
like I have some
influence over the birth list.

01:28.748 --> 01:31.383
All I really do is
keep the alcohol flowing.

01:31.384 --> 01:33.352
What about us?

01:33.353 --> 01:36.588
Do you ever regret
not having a legacy?

01:36.589 --> 01:40.359
Do we have to have this
discussion again, William?

01:40.360 --> 01:43.261
Yeah, we wouldn't want
to talk about anything

01:43.262 --> 01:45.464
that's simmering
beneath the surface.

01:45.465 --> 01:47.599
I'm content. You're
the one with regrets.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.194
Mmhmm.

01:50.269 --> 01:52.245
Thank you.

01:59.545 --> 02:04.049
<i>(Krueger): So, what is this,
some kind of fertility festival?</i>

02:04.050 --> 02:05.584
Essentially.
It's Ostara.

02:05.585 --> 02:08.487
It's a completely unique
cultural phenomenon.

02:08.488 --> 02:10.422
It evolved into
what it became now

02:10.423 --> 02:14.092
out of the necessity for keeping
the ship's population static.

02:14.093 --> 02:16.495
Everything on the ship is
geared to this moment,

02:16.496 --> 02:18.663
finding out who the
birth computer chose.

02:18.664 --> 02:21.666
- With a little help.
- I don't make the selections.

02:21.667 --> 02:23.769
Before couples are
allowed to be marries,

02:23.770 --> 02:25.570
they submit their profiles

02:25.571 --> 02:27.372
and find out their chances
of being selected.

02:27.373 --> 02:31.176
That makes it easy to kill off
any pairings you don't like.

02:31.177 --> 02:34.046
The integrity of
the experiment depends

02:34.047 --> 02:35.884
on non-interference.

02:42.622 --> 02:45.323
What is it? What are you
waiting for, Gault?

02:45.324 --> 02:46.558
If I were single,

02:46.559 --> 02:49.127
I'd be doing a damn site
more than just watching.

02:49.128 --> 02:52.464
You put your name in
for marriage approval?

02:52.465 --> 02:54.533
Every year for the last
3 years straight.

02:54.534 --> 02:57.135
Ah, don't lose faith.
You're a high-value male.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.770
An officer.

02:58.771 --> 03:01.540
It's just a matter of
finding you the right match.

03:01.541 --> 03:03.341
Ma'am!

03:03.342 --> 03:07.179
Do your captain a favor.
Make sure the XO enjoys himself.

03:07.180 --> 03:09.514
To Ostara!

03:09.515 --> 03:10.715
<i>(crew): Ostara!</i>

03:10.716 --> 03:12.084
To Ostara.

03:12.085 --> 03:14.234
(crew applauding)

03:18.624 --> 03:20.808
(woman laughing, echoing)

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:39.112 --> 03:42.719
(woman continues laughing)

03:48.888 --> 03:51.558
Mom!

03:52.825 --> 03:55.494
<i>(whispering):
Hi, Christa.</i>

03:55.495 --> 03:57.295
Do you hear that, mom?

03:57.296 --> 03:59.197
(muttering indistinctly)

03:59.198 --> 04:01.833
(woman continues laughing)

04:20.386 --> 04:23.507
(footsteps)

04:40.373 --> 04:41.540
Be honest.

04:41.541 --> 04:44.776
Who rigs the birth list,
Viondra or your dad?

04:44.777 --> 04:48.847
It isn't rigged, but it's
not a true lottery, either.

04:48.848 --> 04:50.849
Come here!

04:50.850 --> 04:53.952
It's weighted to take into
account genetic variance

04:53.953 --> 04:55.420
in a small gene pool.

04:55.421 --> 04:57.222
Think about it.

04:57.223 --> 04:59.545
We only have 600 people...

05:02.428 --> 05:03.895
To make billions.

05:03.896 --> 05:06.831
So there's a chance,
then, for you and me.

05:06.832 --> 05:09.401
Depends what
the computer decides.

05:09.402 --> 05:11.736
It's kind of romantic,
if you think about it.

05:11.737 --> 05:14.673
One match out of hundreds.

05:14.674 --> 05:17.242
It's a machine that
decides our lives for us.

05:17.243 --> 05:19.803
There's nothing
romantic about that.

05:21.581 --> 05:22.781
(sighing)

05:22.782 --> 05:24.683
Come on.

05:24.684 --> 05:27.388
I don't want to
miss the dancing.

05:35.795 --> 05:38.396
Can you believe she's
actually wearing a crown?

05:38.397 --> 05:39.664
(chuckling)

05:39.665 --> 05:41.333
She thinks she's royalty.

05:41.334 --> 05:44.269
No, it's not a crown.
It's a fertility wreath!

05:44.270 --> 05:47.005
Seems wrong that someone
who opted out of the birth list

05:47.006 --> 05:48.440
should preside over it.

05:48.441 --> 05:50.008
That's actually
a necessity.

05:50.009 --> 05:53.612
It would be such a temptation
to put yourself on the list.

05:53.613 --> 05:56.548
Ah, you're too
young to remember,

05:56.549 --> 05:57.916
but just a
dozen years ago,

05:57.917 --> 06:00.652
the selection was the
most tense day on the ship.

06:00.653 --> 06:02.754
Now it's a party!

06:02.755 --> 06:05.557
<i>(Denninger):
Welcome to Ostara!</i>

06:05.558 --> 06:08.526
<i>(crew):
To Ostara!</i>

06:08.527 --> 06:12.597
The originals knew a journey
of this magnitude

06:12.598 --> 06:15.333
comes with
great sacrifice.

06:15.334 --> 06:20.405
Our lives and laws are governed
by a different set of needs.

06:20.406 --> 06:25.377
Our ancestors could fall
in love, marry and have children

06:25.378 --> 06:26.711
as fate would allow.

06:26.712 --> 06:30.348
But we have a
bigger responsibility:

06:30.349 --> 06:32.951
To ensure the survival
of the human race.

06:32.952 --> 06:36.732
(crew cheering and applauding)

06:56.575 --> 06:58.413
Lorelei?

07:03.916 --> 07:08.887
For us, death and life
are intrinsically intertwined.

07:08.888 --> 07:12.724
Without one, there
cannot be the other.

07:12.725 --> 07:17.165
Let us pause and remember those
who are no longer with us.

07:19.765 --> 07:21.933
Ike Messmer, medical,

07:21.934 --> 07:25.904
John Stokes, stockyard master,

07:25.905 --> 07:30.075
and Lorelei wright, archives.

07:30.076 --> 07:32.544
In their passing,

07:32.545 --> 07:37.123
they allow for a creation
of new life, of new hope.

07:46.692 --> 07:49.639
Lorelei, don't!

07:50.796 --> 07:53.798
Now for the moment
you've been waiting for.

07:53.799 --> 07:57.267
The computer's selection was
sealed in this envelope, unseen.

07:59.038 --> 08:01.106
It is my honor to present...

08:01.107 --> 08:02.941
Deborah and Timothy Fermi.

08:02.942 --> 08:06.028
<i>(woman): Whoo!</i>

08:07.079 --> 08:09.818
Susan and Paul Carr.

08:13.419 --> 08:17.689
And the last name selected for
this year's birth list is...

08:17.690 --> 08:19.824
Emily and Duke Vanderhaus.

08:19.825 --> 08:21.760
(crowd cheering)

08:21.761 --> 08:24.153
Duke, I...

08:26.399 --> 08:29.501
<i>(Viondra): Escort them
to their sleeping pods.</i>

08:29.502 --> 08:30.887
(crowd whistling)

08:38.443 --> 08:40.765
Lorelei, wait!

08:55.761 --> 08:57.762
<i>(Lorelei, echoing):
Look away!</i>

08:57.763 --> 09:00.532
Look away!

09:00.533 --> 09:03.792
<i>(on video):
Let me put on some music.</i>

09:08.207 --> 09:09.974
<i>I love it when you do that.</i>

09:09.975 --> 09:12.444
What is this?

09:12.445 --> 09:15.011
<i>What else do you like?</i>

09:24.924 --> 09:27.625
Shut it off.
Shut it off!

09:27.626 --> 09:30.297
<i>(distorted):
Look away, Christa!</i>

09:31.697 --> 09:34.055
Look away!

09:36.001 --> 09:40.004
(moaning)

09:40.005 --> 09:42.674
(screaming)

09:42.675 --> 09:44.355
<i>(woman):
What's wrong?</i>

09:45.044 --> 09:46.544
Christa!

09:46.545 --> 09:49.307
It's Ok!
Christa, it's Ok!

10:00.759 --> 10:02.560
(Christa gasping)

10:02.561 --> 10:05.096
Go back, before
the tape starts.

10:05.097 --> 10:06.498
(chuckling)

10:06.499 --> 10:08.066
You see?

10:08.067 --> 10:10.101
She's reacting before
the tape begins.

10:10.102 --> 10:11.803
She knew it was
gonna happen,

10:11.804 --> 10:13.571
just like in the
medical center.

10:13.572 --> 10:14.572
And the milk!

10:14.573 --> 10:16.140
My father said
morphic resonance

10:16.141 --> 10:18.176
would take a minimum
of 3 generations,

10:18.177 --> 10:19.210
and he was right!

10:19.211 --> 10:20.245
She's the catalyst.

10:20.246 --> 10:21.880
(Christa screaming on video)

10:21.881 --> 10:25.083
Looks like things are getting
out of hand on your ship.

10:25.084 --> 10:26.284
It's Ostara.

10:26.285 --> 10:28.019
Everyone gets
a little crazy.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.622
Christa is
extremely unstable.

10:30.623 --> 10:33.758
You clearly haven't spent
much time with teenagers.

10:33.759 --> 10:35.627
They're volatile by definition.

10:35.628 --> 10:38.596
You sit here, and you watch
them day in and day out,

10:38.597 --> 10:40.899
but I think that you
forget they're people.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.634
And you forget
I've known Christa

10:42.635 --> 10:43.835
since the day she was born.

10:43.836 --> 10:45.570
I watched her
take her first steps.

10:45.571 --> 10:48.306
And now you get to watch
the project's effect on her.

10:48.307 --> 10:50.803
I bet you're very proud.

10:58.584 --> 11:00.084
What does it do?

11:00.085 --> 11:03.254
Basically, it uses
magnets to look inside you.

11:03.255 --> 11:06.052
Robert's father built
it a long time ago.

11:06.959 --> 11:09.093
Will it be able
to help me?

11:09.094 --> 11:11.996
Part of what makes the brain
just so hard to understand

11:11.997 --> 11:13.698
is that we're stuck
inside of it.

11:13.699 --> 11:15.266
We're just trying
to figure it out.

11:15.267 --> 11:17.869
Like solving
a maze from the inside.

11:17.870 --> 11:19.604
You still don't
remember anything

11:19.605 --> 11:21.105
about the time
when you were sick?

11:21.106 --> 11:22.674
I remember seeing Lorelei.

11:22.675 --> 11:23.775
Lorelei?

11:23.776 --> 11:26.010
You mean in a dream?

11:26.011 --> 11:28.057
At the party.

11:29.815 --> 11:33.585
Lorelei kept telling me to
look away, but I couldn't.

11:33.586 --> 11:36.949
Sometimes, this feeling,
it comes over me.

11:38.023 --> 11:40.992
I don't know how
to explain it.

11:40.993 --> 11:43.628
Try. I'd like to know.

11:43.629 --> 11:48.415
It feels like
I'm holding back an ocean.

11:50.936 --> 11:54.138
<i>(Viondra): Dammit, William!</i>
You should've known better.

11:54.139 --> 11:56.708
How many times am
I gonna have to tell you?

11:56.709 --> 11:58.810
I had no idea Lorelei
was filming me.

11:58.811 --> 12:00.912
Half of power
is perception,

12:00.913 --> 12:03.214
and thanks to your stunning
lack of restraint,

12:03.215 --> 12:05.950
everything that I have
worked for has come undone

12:05.951 --> 12:07.285
in one humiliating moment!

12:07.286 --> 12:08.920
It's gonna blow over.

12:08.921 --> 12:12.290
We're not gonna end up in
the lower decks anytime soon.

12:12.291 --> 12:15.660
Do you think all my efforts
to keep you seated,

12:15.661 --> 12:17.929
the negotiation,
the favor-trading,

12:17.930 --> 12:19.297
my lunches with Rose,

12:19.298 --> 12:22.667
are because I'm afraid
to go back to the lower decks?

12:22.668 --> 12:25.637
I've been there, William!
It doesn't frighten me!

12:25.638 --> 12:28.039
It was your goddamn
birth-list ceremony!

12:28.040 --> 12:30.875
I mean, how the hell
did that video get shown?

12:30.876 --> 12:34.312
I have no idea,
but it's cost us dearly!

12:34.313 --> 12:39.117
Do you think I don't know
what people say about me,

12:39.118 --> 12:42.954
that I'm self-indulgent,
manipulative, a harpy?

12:42.955 --> 12:46.090
I'm not who people
think I am, William.

12:46.091 --> 12:47.392
I'm not.

12:47.393 --> 12:51.029
If they knew the compromises
that I have made...

12:51.030 --> 12:54.065
That was the bargain
that we both entered into.

12:54.066 --> 12:56.901
You're the one
that complicated it.

12:56.902 --> 13:00.071
Because I was foolish enough
to love you,

13:00.072 --> 13:03.227
to think that we were
in this together?

13:10.115 --> 13:12.850
And they meant
nothing to me.

13:12.851 --> 13:14.252
You know that.

13:14.253 --> 13:17.288
None of them
compare to you.

13:17.289 --> 13:20.124
I saw the way
you looked at Lorelei.

13:20.125 --> 13:24.228
It's been years since I've
seen that look in your eyes.

13:24.229 --> 13:27.524
I'd almost forgotten
you were capable of it.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.055
I hope it was worth it.

13:37.976 --> 13:41.012
You know, you can drink
in the officer's lounge

13:41.013 --> 13:42.413
now that you're a cadet.

13:42.414 --> 13:44.807
It's not my
favorite place right now.

13:46.852 --> 13:48.319
Of all the men on the ship,

13:48.320 --> 13:51.025
I never would've
guessed it was the captain.

13:52.057 --> 13:53.958
I'm sorry, James.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.760
(sniffing)

13:55.761 --> 13:57.929
I don't know what to say.

13:57.930 --> 14:00.832
Don't.

14:00.833 --> 14:03.334
We're never gonna
be matched, Nora.

14:03.335 --> 14:05.069
There's no point
in starting this.

14:05.070 --> 14:07.739
- James!
- I knew I didn't have a future with Lorelei.

14:07.740 --> 14:11.075
But with you, I fooled myself
into thinking it was possible.

14:11.076 --> 14:13.244
It is! You have to
have faith in the system.

14:13.245 --> 14:14.512
The system's rigged,

14:14.513 --> 14:16.814
all the hope in the
world won't change that.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.483
I refuse to believe that.

14:18.484 --> 14:19.884
It's the truth.

14:19.885 --> 14:23.054
So, until someone
finds the courage

14:23.055 --> 14:25.389
to destroy the birth computer

14:25.390 --> 14:27.258
and change everything
on this ship,

14:27.259 --> 14:30.068
we should stop
seeing each other.

14:42.274 --> 14:43.975
You know, it's kind...

14:43.976 --> 14:46.077
Looks like
someone lost a bet!

14:46.078 --> 14:49.247
Um, no, a couple of
the guys just had a wager

14:49.248 --> 14:52.784
about who'd get chosen
for the birth list.

14:52.785 --> 14:55.353
That's a pretty
steep challenge,

14:55.354 --> 14:58.523
trying to keep people
from procreating.

14:58.524 --> 15:01.826
Kind of goes against
human nature.

15:01.827 --> 15:06.063
How do they keep them
from getting knocked up?

15:06.064 --> 15:10.134
And fooling around seems to
be their number-one pastime.

15:10.135 --> 15:14.405
It's, um, subcutaneous birth-
control implants at puberty.

15:14.406 --> 15:17.341
And everyone just
always follows the rules?

15:17.342 --> 15:20.011
Uh, no.

15:20.012 --> 15:22.113
No, uh, some people rebel.

15:22.114 --> 15:25.183
They try to circumvent the
system, rip out their implants.

15:25.184 --> 15:27.018
Their kids are
called "unclaimed."

15:27.019 --> 15:29.954
The families are pretty much at
the bottom of the food chain.

15:29.955 --> 15:31.255
Total pariahs.

15:31.256 --> 15:34.091
And they knowingly put
themselves in that position?

15:34.092 --> 15:36.060
Well, some people
are just hardwired

15:36.061 --> 15:37.295
to want to have families,

15:37.296 --> 15:39.397
regardless of whether
or not they should.

15:39.398 --> 15:40.598
Should?

15:40.599 --> 15:43.501
Genetically
speaking, of course.

15:43.502 --> 15:45.408
Of course.

15:49.942 --> 15:53.010
And what does Enzmann
look for, genetically speaking,

15:53.011 --> 15:55.346
when determining who
make the birth list?

15:55.347 --> 15:58.850
Oh, no, no, no! Harris has
nothing to do with it.

15:58.851 --> 16:01.018
It's purely a
mathematic equation.

16:01.019 --> 16:03.221
Also known as
old-school eugenics.

16:03.222 --> 16:05.289
Well, that's kind
of a strong word.

16:05.290 --> 16:08.059
You're deciding who
can and cannot procreate.

16:08.060 --> 16:09.460
From where I stand,

16:09.461 --> 16:13.264
that makes social Darwinism
look like a walk in the park.

16:13.265 --> 16:15.533
You could've fired
a warning shot!

16:15.534 --> 16:18.002
Warren told you
she got my report?

16:18.003 --> 16:20.571
Yes, and she's on her way
over here now.

16:20.572 --> 16:25.176
I thought you were starting
to grasp what we're doing here,

16:25.177 --> 16:27.979
the impact it will have
on all of our futures.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.615
Oh, I do, and I think
that you've gone unchecked

16:30.616 --> 16:32.499
for far too long.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.385
You have no concept
of the damage you've done.

16:34.386 --> 16:36.087
You've cut me off
at the knees!

16:36.088 --> 16:38.890
I don't work for you.

16:38.891 --> 16:40.658
I work for her.

16:48.233 --> 16:49.667
(rose chuckling)

16:49.668 --> 16:52.069
You're working out
your frustrations,

16:52.070 --> 16:54.572
or are you just avoiding
your lovely wife?

16:54.573 --> 16:56.641
I'd imagine she's not
pleased with you!

16:56.642 --> 16:58.609
My marriage is none
of your business.

16:58.610 --> 17:01.312
You made it the business
of everyone on this ship.

17:01.313 --> 17:04.482
That was some show you put on.
I was on the edge of my seat!

17:04.483 --> 17:07.018
I couldn't wait to see
what would happen next.

17:07.019 --> 17:09.587
Nothing stands in the way
of my duty to the ship.

17:09.588 --> 17:11.422
You'd be wise
to remember that.

17:11.423 --> 17:13.590
Looks like
I've overstayed my welcome.

17:13.592 --> 17:15.126
Captain.

17:15.127 --> 17:17.623
Rose, I'll see you
in chambers.

17:19.397 --> 17:21.031
(chuckling)

17:21.032 --> 17:22.633
Is something funny?

17:22.634 --> 17:26.704
You have no idea how
powerless you really are.

17:26.704 --> 17:28.539
What do you want, Rose?

17:28.540 --> 17:31.709
I want you to step down
as captain, Denninger.

17:31.710 --> 17:32.710
Ha! Never.

17:32.711 --> 17:35.379
Fine! Very well.

17:35.380 --> 17:38.249
I prefer the public
humiliation anyway.

17:38.250 --> 17:41.352
Your movie swayed councilman
Davis to see things my way.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.654
Now I have a
clear majority.

17:43.655 --> 17:46.524
I'm gonna make you beg in
front of the whole ship.

17:46.525 --> 17:50.461
It's been a while since I've
seen a Denninger on their knees,

17:50.462 --> 17:53.513
but tell your wife
I send my regards.

17:54.633 --> 17:56.470
(Rose groaning)

17:58.070 --> 17:59.570
<i>(woman):
What's going on?</i>

17:59.571 --> 18:02.139
(groaning)

18:02.140 --> 18:04.290
<i>(man 1):
Sir! Sir!</i>

18:07.279 --> 18:09.447
(groaning)

18:09.448 --> 18:12.049
<i>(man 2):
Sir, that's enough! Stop!</i>

18:12.050 --> 18:15.353
Sir! Councilman!

18:15.354 --> 18:17.468
- Please!
- Sir!

18:18.457 --> 18:21.647
You're done,
Denninger! Done!

18:22.594 --> 18:24.695
<i>(Denninger):
Let go!</i>

18:24.696 --> 18:27.131
Get off of me!
I'm fine.

18:27.132 --> 18:29.350
(panting)

18:30.202 --> 18:31.761
(beeping)

18:40.712 --> 18:42.410
(lock beeping)

18:45.751 --> 18:48.185
Time for your
happy pills, Stokes.

18:48.186 --> 18:49.468
You know the drill.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.257
I need to go to the can.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.805
Pills first!

19:16.048 --> 19:17.815
(groaning)

19:35.434 --> 19:38.381
(beeping)

19:41.173 --> 19:43.183
(grunting)

19:47.546 --> 19:49.780
<i>(Warren): I've left room
for your comments.</i>

19:49.781 --> 19:52.116
You cannot send
this report up the chain.

19:52.117 --> 19:55.386
- Perhaps you forget our respective ranks.
- Seriously, Katherine...

19:55.387 --> 19:57.755
If this is a plea
based on personal friendship...

19:57.756 --> 19:58.856
Friendship, my ass!

19:58.857 --> 20:00.658
From the beginning,
you've seen this

20:00.659 --> 20:03.227
as a stepping stone to power
in and of itself.

20:03.228 --> 20:05.796
It means nothing to you.
That's why you need me.

20:05.797 --> 20:07.698
Only someone who
lives and breathes

20:07.699 --> 20:10.801
and devotes his life, his
health, his sanity to this job

20:10.802 --> 20:12.636
has any chance of
pulling it off.

20:12.637 --> 20:15.806
So, you're the only smart,
motivated person on the planet?

20:15.807 --> 20:18.876
I'm not irreplaceable
because I'm smart.

20:18.877 --> 20:21.512
I'm irreplaceable
because I'm obsessed!

20:21.513 --> 20:24.582
Do you know how
we met, your father and I?

20:24.583 --> 20:27.785
It was at Nellis. I was part of
the president's advance team.

20:27.786 --> 20:29.120
And when we arrived,

20:29.121 --> 20:31.322
we found your father
working on the tarmac,

20:31.323 --> 20:32.656
covered in grease and dirt,

20:32.657 --> 20:35.326
up to his elbows in one
of his prototype engines.

20:35.327 --> 20:38.195
He was threatening to murder
every airman on the base

20:38.196 --> 20:40.531
if he didn't get a socket
wrench that moment.

20:40.532 --> 20:45.202
But, evidently, the same design
had exploded a few days before.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.771
And I grabbed that wrench,
and I marched up to him

20:47.772 --> 20:49.773
and introduced myself
to your father.

20:49.774 --> 20:51.575
And he hired me on the spot.

20:51.576 --> 20:55.412
You quit a job with the
president to work for my father?

20:55.413 --> 20:56.780
Yes.

20:56.781 --> 20:59.583
He had a way of making
other men, even great men,

20:59.584 --> 21:02.567
seem ordinary when
they stood beside him.

21:04.923 --> 21:08.659
I didn't take
this job for power.

21:08.660 --> 21:11.662
I took it because it
means something to me.

21:11.663 --> 21:13.531
And I am questioning

21:13.532 --> 21:16.233
whether you're the right
person to drive this ship.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.668
(cell phone ringing)

21:17.669 --> 21:18.869
(sighing)

21:18.870 --> 21:20.371
(scoffing)

21:20.372 --> 21:21.672
Yeah.

21:21.673 --> 21:24.275
<i>(Carrillo): We have a problem.
Stokes is gone.</i>

21:24.276 --> 21:29.513
Nine, together.
Ten, and done!

21:38.857 --> 21:41.825
I heard Lorelei was
pregnant when she died.

21:41.826 --> 21:44.695
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

21:44.696 --> 21:46.797
Report back to the
stewardess dorms.

21:46.798 --> 21:49.358
Prepare for a
full inspection.

21:49.701 --> 21:51.434
Now!

22:21.900 --> 22:24.327
(sighing)

22:30.408 --> 22:32.543
Don't worry.
No one saw me.

22:32.544 --> 22:35.379
I was careful.

22:35.380 --> 22:37.481
That wasn't smart.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.550
I'm under a lot
of scrutiny.

22:39.551 --> 22:41.785
It sounds like
you need to relax.

22:41.786 --> 22:44.595
No, what I need
is to find out...

22:46.391 --> 22:50.861
Look, what I need is to find
out who uploaded that video.

22:50.862 --> 22:54.632
There's only one person
it could've been.

22:54.633 --> 22:56.533
Your wife.

22:56.534 --> 23:00.804
What possible reason
would she have to do that?

23:00.805 --> 23:04.341
Hell hath no fury like
an older woman scorned.

23:04.342 --> 23:06.644
Don't underestimate
experience.

23:06.645 --> 23:09.407
Can experience
give you a child?

23:11.549 --> 23:14.775
I need something, a favor.

23:15.787 --> 23:17.888
Can I trust you?

23:17.889 --> 23:19.935
Anything.

23:23.628 --> 23:26.930
I need this delivered
to the lower 40s.

23:26.931 --> 23:29.500
I can't do it myself.

23:29.501 --> 23:31.001
There are too
many eyes on me.

23:31.002 --> 23:33.568
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

23:42.447 --> 23:44.457
(zipper lowering)

24:00.532 --> 24:04.069
Ssorry! I... I didn't know
you were down here.

24:35.533 --> 24:38.030
(door slamming)

24:39.070 --> 24:41.505
Hey!

24:41.506 --> 24:45.676
What deck are we on, huh?

24:45.677 --> 24:48.045
Where's the
captain been hiding?

24:48.046 --> 24:51.081
I've never been on this
part of the ship before.

24:51.082 --> 24:53.517
We must be below
water reclamation,

24:53.518 --> 24:54.885
near the pusher plate.

24:54.886 --> 24:56.453
(grunting)

24:56.454 --> 25:00.270
I can't... I can't imagine
how this must be for you.

25:01.726 --> 25:04.962
I didn't kill
that girl, all right?

25:04.963 --> 25:07.131
I will not rot
down here forever.

25:07.132 --> 25:09.133
You can tell
the captain that.

25:09.134 --> 25:12.637
I'm afraid that's
not gonna happen.

25:14.072 --> 25:18.130
Then you take me to him,
and I'll tell him myself.

25:19.611 --> 25:21.745
(gasping)

25:21.746 --> 25:24.000
You know I'm
a butcher, right?

25:28.686 --> 25:30.593
I need to talk to you.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.824
Duke will be back soon.

25:33.825 --> 25:35.893
I'm looking for
Lorelei's stenotab.

25:35.894 --> 25:37.895
Do you know where it is?

25:37.896 --> 25:41.131
All of her possessions were
turned into the safety office.

25:41.132 --> 25:43.934
The stenotab was
never logged in.

25:43.935 --> 25:45.936
Who did you
turn it over to?

25:45.937 --> 25:47.671
Who do you think?

25:47.672 --> 25:50.007
Why are you
acting this way?

25:50.008 --> 25:52.776
Aaron, you know
what's between us is over.

25:52.777 --> 25:54.778
You can't find excuses to...

25:54.779 --> 25:57.147
You're the one discussing
our relationship,

25:57.148 --> 25:58.949
not me.

25:58.950 --> 26:02.019
I came to ask a question,
and I got an answer.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.996
Thank you.

26:05.523 --> 26:08.692
Oh, and congratulations
on the birth list.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.635
You must be very happy.

26:14.632 --> 26:16.133
We're locked down.

26:16.134 --> 26:18.802
Security's looking for him.
He can't get far.

26:18.803 --> 26:22.473
Director Warren is talking
contingency plans, Carrillo.

26:22.474 --> 26:25.609
It's not just the project
that's at stake. It's us.

26:25.610 --> 26:27.933
Find Stokes.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.719
Who's that?

26:55.073 --> 26:57.841
I'm supposed to
deliver this.

26:57.842 --> 26:59.610
From the captain.

27:09.988 --> 27:12.089
You're not getting
enough rations.

27:12.090 --> 27:14.691
He's an unclaimed, isn't he?

27:14.692 --> 27:16.876
You should go.

27:20.565 --> 27:23.634
Take me to the bridge.
I wanna talk to Denninger.

27:23.635 --> 27:24.902
You've gotta believe me!

27:24.903 --> 27:26.870
He doesn't know
any more than you do.

27:26.871 --> 27:28.672
No, you're lying!
He framed me!

27:28.673 --> 27:30.707
I know that you
didn't kill Lorelei.

27:30.708 --> 27:33.043
How do you know
that, huh? Who are you?

27:33.044 --> 27:34.778
(men talking in distance)

27:34.779 --> 27:36.647
Safety officers!

27:36.648 --> 27:39.283
(man on hand radio, indistinct)

27:39.284 --> 27:41.329
<i>(guard):
Sound the all clear.</i>

27:51.329 --> 27:54.034
(both panting)

27:55.099 --> 27:56.937
Why didn't you scream?

27:58.169 --> 28:00.304
I wanna help you.

28:00.305 --> 28:02.801
Why? What do you care?

28:08.179 --> 28:10.953
No, don't go in
there, please! Please!

28:30.902 --> 28:33.711
(breathing heavily)

28:40.278 --> 28:43.052
The ship landed?

28:44.082 --> 28:46.058
Where?

28:51.255 --> 28:53.440
We're on earth.

28:57.695 --> 29:01.665
That's impossible.
We didn't turn around.

29:01.666 --> 29:03.712
You never left.

29:06.004 --> 29:10.774
No, we... we haven't had
contact in decades.

29:10.775 --> 29:13.343
No, this is
some kind of trick!

29:13.344 --> 29:16.880
Stokes, listen to me!
You never left earth.

29:16.881 --> 29:20.651
(crying)

29:20.652 --> 29:23.186
I don't...
I don't understand!

29:23.187 --> 29:24.888
I don't understand!

29:24.889 --> 29:28.959
They've been lying to you
since before you were born.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.762
They've lied to you
about everything.

29:31.763 --> 29:33.739
We have to get
out of here now.

29:34.766 --> 29:36.266
Stokes!

29:36.267 --> 29:38.277
We have to go now!

29:40.238 --> 29:42.110
We have to go!

29:53.985 --> 29:56.186
How's she doing?

29:56.187 --> 29:57.921
She suffered
intense trauma,

29:57.922 --> 30:00.791
and her brain may have
forged some faulty pathways

30:00.792 --> 30:02.059
to avoid dealing with it.

30:02.060 --> 30:05.262
- She's been through a lot.
- Yeah.

30:05.263 --> 30:08.231
That video that was
shown during Ostara,

30:08.232 --> 30:12.369
can you tracks the access code
that was used to upload it.

30:12.370 --> 30:15.172
The subvid data
woven into each file,

30:15.173 --> 30:18.328
it should track the codes.

30:20.044 --> 30:22.846
So, it looks like
this was broadcast

30:22.847 --> 30:25.282
from a terminal
on deck 13.

30:25.283 --> 30:27.250
<i>(Lorelei): Let me put
on some music.</i>

30:27.251 --> 30:29.419
<i>(Bryce):
Section C. Wait a minute.</i>

30:29.420 --> 30:31.021
That doesn't make any sense.

30:31.022 --> 30:32.322
What is it?

30:32.323 --> 30:35.492
That's the captain's
access code.

30:35.493 --> 30:38.228
That's impossible!
The captain didn't upload it.

30:38.229 --> 30:41.765
Well, then, somebody
who had his code did.

30:41.766 --> 30:44.332
<i>(Lorelei): I love it
when you do that.</i>

30:45.169 --> 30:47.562
<i>(echoing):
Christa!</i>

30:48.840 --> 30:51.544
Christa!

30:59.417 --> 31:01.818
Hi! What are
you doing home?

31:01.819 --> 31:06.022
I got off work early
to have my implant removed.

31:06.023 --> 31:08.091
(chuckling)

31:08.092 --> 31:11.595
I still can't believe
this is happening.

31:15.533 --> 31:17.501
What's wrong?

31:17.502 --> 31:22.218
Gault came by to ask
about Lorelei's stenotab.

31:23.174 --> 31:24.374
Gault, here?

31:24.375 --> 31:26.843
And what did you tell him?

31:26.844 --> 31:29.045
That you took it
to the safety office.

31:29.046 --> 31:31.348
He told me it was
never logged in.

31:31.349 --> 31:32.349
Hmm...

31:32.350 --> 31:34.384
Duke, tell me the truth.

31:34.385 --> 31:37.154
It was stolen from
the safety office.

31:37.155 --> 31:40.557
I didn't realize it was
missing until after Ostara.

31:40.558 --> 31:42.325
Why didn't you tell me?

31:42.326 --> 31:46.930
The better question is why did
Gault bypass the safety office

31:46.931 --> 31:49.199
and come to see my
wife in our cabin?

31:49.200 --> 31:52.936
He probably thought I'd
forgotten to give it to you.

31:52.937 --> 31:55.438
I'm not a fool, Emily.

31:55.439 --> 31:58.241
Please don't
treat me like one.

31:58.242 --> 32:00.947
I've seen the way
he looks at you.

32:04.348 --> 32:07.984
We haven't always been
as close as I'd like,

32:07.985 --> 32:10.453
but we're going
to have a child.

32:10.454 --> 32:12.556
We've been chosen.

32:12.557 --> 32:15.892
I need to know that
I'm your first choice.

32:15.893 --> 32:18.216
You are.

32:19.430 --> 32:22.309
And that there hasn't
been anyone else.

32:32.276 --> 32:34.110
I told myself I was
being paranoid,

32:34.111 --> 32:35.345
that it was one-sided.

32:35.346 --> 32:37.547
"Let him have a
crush," I thought.

32:37.548 --> 32:38.949
"Let him envy me!"

32:38.950 --> 32:41.318
I ended it. I ended
it to be with you.

32:41.319 --> 32:43.669
(sniffling)

32:43.670 --> 32:46.022
Sleeping with an officer's
wife, that is serious enough,

32:46.023 --> 32:47.924
but now that your
implant is gone...

32:47.925 --> 32:49.893
Duke, I would never!

32:49.894 --> 32:52.596
If he touches you now, that is
treason against the ship,

32:52.597 --> 32:54.564
and I will make sure

32:54.565 --> 32:57.634
he goes straight back
to the lower decks.

32:57.635 --> 32:59.993
(crying)

33:01.505 --> 33:04.107
(both panting)

33:04.108 --> 33:05.598
This way!

33:08.412 --> 33:09.913
(beeping)

33:09.914 --> 33:11.439
Come on!

33:13.451 --> 33:15.452
(man on hand radio, indistinct)

33:15.453 --> 33:17.359
Stop where you are!

33:23.294 --> 33:25.495
How did you get
past the checkpoint?

33:25.496 --> 33:28.398
TC group.
Full authorization.

33:28.399 --> 33:29.466
Step aside.

33:29.467 --> 33:31.339
Yes, sir.
I apologize.

33:34.105 --> 33:36.139
All right.
Thank you.

33:36.140 --> 33:39.342
An armed contingent
just arrived from TC.

33:39.343 --> 33:42.045
There's been a vote
of no confidence.

33:42.046 --> 33:45.282
The TC group wants to
move in another direction,

33:45.283 --> 33:47.984
and I'll be taking
a more hands-on rule

33:47.985 --> 33:49.352
for the time being.

33:49.353 --> 33:52.389
They're arriving to
escort me off the premises,

33:52.390 --> 33:55.492
drive me into
a field somewhere?

33:55.493 --> 33:57.394
Katherine, please!

33:57.395 --> 34:01.197
I told you we are close.
I've had a success!

34:01.198 --> 34:03.700
All you have done
is conceal the truth

34:03.701 --> 34:07.003
about the anomaly,
the sabotage, the explosion.

34:07.004 --> 34:10.072
The group feels you have
lost your objectivity,

34:10.074 --> 34:11.206
and they're right.

34:11.208 --> 34:12.976
You've become a liability.

34:12.976 --> 34:15.078
Perhaps if you had
been more forthcoming,

34:15.079 --> 34:16.679
you wouldn't find
yourself in this position.

34:16.681 --> 34:19.416
Well, what are you
gonna tell my family,

34:19.417 --> 34:21.952
that I drove my car
off a bridge?

34:21.953 --> 34:23.553
Or is it gonna be
a hiking accident?

34:23.554 --> 34:25.522
Oh, don't
torture yourself!

34:25.523 --> 34:27.690
Harris, your family
will be well provided for.

34:27.692 --> 34:30.592
So, all of this, keeping me
here, was just to keep me busy

34:30.594 --> 34:32.329
until my retirement
squad arrives?

34:32.330 --> 34:35.331
Listen, I know you
consider this a betrayal.

34:35.333 --> 34:37.100
Without me,
this project is over.

34:37.101 --> 34:40.136
The people on that ship don't
stand a chance. You'll fail.

34:40.137 --> 34:43.540
They'll be gassed inside of
6 months, and you know it!

34:43.541 --> 34:45.375
You've already failed, Harris.

34:45.376 --> 34:47.277
- Katherine, please!
- It's over.

34:47.277 --> 34:50.013
I'm begging you!
Katherine?

34:50.014 --> 34:52.822
Please! Listen to me!

34:55.485 --> 34:57.120
(stenotab beeping)

34:57.121 --> 34:58.521
Whatever you have planned,

34:58.522 --> 35:01.111
you sure you have
enough to unseat him?

35:10.568 --> 35:13.168
(men and women clearing throats)

35:21.278 --> 35:23.480
Mrs. Denninger.

35:23.481 --> 35:25.682
Would you please
tell the council

35:25.683 --> 35:28.351
the laws regarding
the birth list?

35:28.352 --> 35:30.754
No man or woman will reproduce

35:30.755 --> 35:33.623
who has not been selected
from the birth list.

35:33.624 --> 35:37.594
Mmhmm, and the children born
from unsanctioned pairings

35:37.595 --> 35:40.363
are a burden to
the shipboard community.

35:40.364 --> 35:44.300
And their progenitors
are subject to discipline,

35:44.301 --> 35:46.236
are they not?

35:46.237 --> 35:47.704
The parent of an unclaimed

35:47.705 --> 35:49.773
is forbidden to
hold office or rank.

35:49.774 --> 35:51.784
Exactly!

35:53.077 --> 35:54.775
Send them in, please.

36:19.437 --> 36:22.072
Director Warren.

36:22.073 --> 36:25.675
Mr. Carrillo,
thank you for coming.

36:25.676 --> 36:28.511
Well, as you may
have guessed,

36:28.512 --> 36:30.547
there's been a
change in leadership.

36:30.548 --> 36:33.550
I'll be overseeing <i>Ascension</i>
during the transitional period.

36:33.551 --> 36:36.186
I want you to know
how grateful I am

36:36.187 --> 36:38.421
for alerting me
to the anomaly.

36:38.422 --> 36:40.590
I was just doing my job.

36:40.591 --> 36:43.093
Well, that's why
I'm keeping you on.

36:43.094 --> 36:45.654
I look forward to
working with you.

36:59.743 --> 37:02.812
Katherine, please!

37:02.813 --> 37:06.583
Director Warren, please!

37:06.584 --> 37:09.552
Katherine,
I'm begging you!

37:09.553 --> 37:11.521
Look at me!

37:11.522 --> 37:13.949
Come on, this way!

37:15.192 --> 37:16.856
Come on!

37:30.474 --> 37:32.520
<i>(echoing): Christa.</i>

37:34.245 --> 37:37.213
Christa!

37:37.214 --> 37:39.225
Christa!

37:41.719 --> 37:44.250
I wanna show you.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.681
You didn't
congratulate me!

38:11.682 --> 38:13.349
I'm gonna be a father!

38:13.350 --> 38:14.450
Duke...

38:14.451 --> 38:16.553
After all these
years of waiting,

38:16.554 --> 38:18.521
I should be happy about it,
but I'm not,

38:18.522 --> 38:19.822
'cause, see,
I just found out

38:19.823 --> 38:23.293
that my wife has been
sleeping with another man!

38:23.294 --> 38:26.380
You couldn't find
your own woman, huh?

38:27.731 --> 38:29.666
(Vanderhaus grunting,
Gault groaning)

38:29.667 --> 38:34.627
Goddamn decker!
You put your hands on my wife!

38:35.906 --> 38:37.952
Captain...

38:39.710 --> 38:42.912
You know this woman
and child, don't you?

38:42.913 --> 38:46.783
And what is the nature of
your relationship with them?

38:46.784 --> 38:47.984
None.

38:47.985 --> 38:49.686
None?

38:49.687 --> 38:50.987
(chuckling)

38:50.988 --> 38:53.790
You've been sending ration
credits to them, sir.

38:53.791 --> 38:56.526
I took it upon myself
to ensure food for the boy.

38:56.527 --> 38:57.961
Hardly an impeachable defense.

38:57.962 --> 38:58.962
Is that so?

38:58.963 --> 39:01.564
Now that it's out in the open,

39:01.565 --> 39:03.733
I find councilman
Davis' unwillingness

39:03.734 --> 39:06.269
to take responsibility
for his son shameful.

39:06.270 --> 39:09.606
It's bad enough that Davis
has broken the ship's laws,

39:09.607 --> 39:12.242
but to allow his
own child to suffer

39:12.243 --> 39:16.346
so that he can maintain his
position and life of luxury

39:16.347 --> 39:17.732
is repugnant.

39:21.752 --> 39:23.953
Well...

39:23.954 --> 39:26.723
In light of these
recent revelations,

39:26.724 --> 39:28.625
perhaps we should...

39:28.626 --> 39:31.561
The ship's bylaws are
quite clear on this matter.

39:31.562 --> 39:33.572
Goddammit, Rose!

39:40.004 --> 39:41.537
Councilman Davis,

39:41.538 --> 39:44.540
I'm afraid we are going
to have to demand

39:44.541 --> 39:46.899
your immediate
resignation.

39:56.287 --> 39:57.987
(panting)

39:57.988 --> 40:00.727
(birds chirping)

40:05.396 --> 40:07.930
It's so bright!

40:07.931 --> 40:10.394
I can barely see!

40:12.069 --> 40:14.070
(laughing)

40:14.071 --> 40:17.088
Stokes, please, we gotta
get out of here now!

40:20.911 --> 40:23.685
We've gotta go!

40:33.457 --> 40:37.827
Hans Yablon.
I knew him.

40:41.532 --> 40:45.139
Captain Elgin.

40:46.570 --> 40:49.739
Mitchell bowman.
What... what is this?

40:49.740 --> 40:51.674
It's a memorial.

40:51.675 --> 40:56.115
All these people died
without ever knowing the truth?

41:01.552 --> 41:03.041
Dwight crouch.

41:04.722 --> 41:07.423
Stokes, we gotta
go now! Hey!

41:07.424 --> 41:09.459
We have to
go now! Hey!

41:09.460 --> 41:11.427
(both grunting)

41:11.428 --> 41:12.795
Why did you bring me here?

41:12.796 --> 41:15.998
Why did you bring me
here to my son's grave?

41:15.999 --> 41:18.566
(panting)

41:24.441 --> 41:26.521
(men grunting)

41:27.711 --> 41:30.113
(roaring)

41:30.114 --> 41:32.382
(gasping)

41:32.383 --> 41:34.684
(both grunting)

41:34.685 --> 41:36.070
Lorelei!

41:51.568 --> 41:53.870
(electricity crackling,
Vanderhaus groaning)

41:53.871 --> 41:55.014
Duke!

42:29.606 --> 42:32.068
It's Christa.

42:39.183 --> 42:41.517
(alarm blaring)

42:41.518 --> 42:43.945
(Warren coughing)

42:45.889 --> 42:49.559
Oh! What was that?

42:49.560 --> 42:51.605
Did you see anyone?

42:56.700 --> 42:58.642
Dead.

43:03.173 --> 43:05.675
(both grunting)

43:05.676 --> 43:07.844
I underestimated you, Harris.

43:07.845 --> 43:10.780
That was one hell
of a contingency place!

43:10.781 --> 43:12.882
I swear I had
nothing to do with it!

43:12.883 --> 43:14.684
I have never seen
anything like it!

43:14.685 --> 43:15.952
Get him out of here!

43:15.953 --> 43:18.120
Find out what happened
to the power!

43:18.121 --> 43:20.122
Katherine, listen to me!

43:20.123 --> 43:22.124
The bunker, it has
massive redundancies.

43:22.125 --> 43:25.127
It's shouldn't be possible for
anything to short the system!

43:25.128 --> 43:27.129
Whatever it was,
it came from that ship!

43:27.130 --> 43:28.931
It had to be Christa.

43:28.932 --> 43:30.874
Wait!

43:33.170 --> 43:35.204
The girl in
Krueger's report.

43:35.205 --> 43:37.840
We have never
had anything like it.

43:37.841 --> 43:40.610
She is punctuated
evolution made real!

43:40.611 --> 43:43.801
Everything that
we've been working for.

43:45.782 --> 43:47.950
Tell me more.

43:47.951 --> 43:51.954
(electricity crackling)

43:51.955 --> 43:54.730
(alarm blaring)

44:00.764 --> 44:03.851
Mr. Gault!
Wake up, please!

44:09.706 --> 44:12.074
<i>(echoing):
I saw Lorelei.</i>

44:12.075 --> 44:13.776
She led me here.

44:13.777 --> 44:16.100
<i>(whispering):
Christa...</i>

44:23.554 --> 44:25.772
(groaning)

44:27.024 --> 44:28.958
Christa.

44:28.959 --> 44:30.826
Why did you bring me here?

44:30.827 --> 44:32.094
(sobbing)

44:32.095 --> 44:34.730
Stokes, listen to me.
Listen to me!

44:34.731 --> 44:37.266
You're right!
You're right!

44:37.267 --> 44:40.670
Their lives were
wasted, but not yours.

44:40.671 --> 44:43.072
You know the truth, Stokes.
You can help.

44:43.073 --> 44:45.575
You can save the people
still on <i>Ascension.</i>

44:45.576 --> 44:47.743
<i>(guard):
Hands in the air!</i>

44:47.744 --> 44:50.580
Stay where you are,
and show me your id.

44:50.581 --> 44:53.249
Ok! Samantha Krueger.

44:53.250 --> 44:55.051
Nice and easy.

44:55.052 --> 44:57.687
Special operations.

44:57.688 --> 45:00.022
- Scan it.
- Ok, ok!

45:00.023 --> 45:01.895
(beeping)

45:08.999 --> 45:11.033
Hey! That's enough!

45:11.034 --> 45:14.780
Hey, that's enough!
We gotta go!

45:15.772 --> 45:17.020
Come on!

45:20.377 --> 45:22.011
(car beeping)

45:22.012 --> 45:25.271
It's this one here!
Here! Get in!

45:29.853 --> 45:32.388
Hey! Hey!
Get in!

45:32.389 --> 45:34.053
Get in!

45:38.228 --> 45:40.229
You're bleeding.

45:40.230 --> 45:43.799
(panting)

45:43.800 --> 45:46.360
<i>(whispering):
Ok! Ok!</i>

45:49.139 --> 45:52.190
(electricity crackling)

45:53.910 --> 45:57.747
Gault! Gault!
Come on!

45:57.748 --> 45:59.949
Come on, wake up! Wake up!

45:59.950 --> 46:00.950
What?

46:00.951 --> 46:02.318
You must've been caught

46:02.319 --> 46:04.387
in the electrical
discharge from the surge.

46:04.388 --> 46:06.088
You are lucky to be alive

46:06.089 --> 46:07.323
surge?

46:07.324 --> 46:10.326
<i>(woman): I don't
understand what happened!</i>

46:10.327 --> 46:12.928
(woman groaning)

46:12.929 --> 46:15.698
What's going on?

46:15.699 --> 46:18.091
(squealing)

46:22.239 --> 46:24.770
Oh my god!

46:27.811 --> 46:29.745
<i>(men and women): Oh!</i>

46:29.746 --> 46:32.312
<i>(man): Take cover!</i>

46:34.384 --> 46:36.786
I need gate 23
open, goddammit!

46:36.787 --> 46:39.908
Carrillo!
I need answers.

46:40.724 --> 46:42.091
Uh...

46:42.092 --> 46:44.160
Every system connected
to the ship is out,

46:44.161 --> 46:46.696
electrical,
surveillance, security.

46:46.697 --> 46:48.798
What about the
backup generators?

46:48.799 --> 46:50.099
They're all fried.

46:50.100 --> 46:52.802
It must've been a massive
electromagnetic burst.

46:52.803 --> 46:54.136
I had to reroute
to get power!

46:54.137 --> 46:55.705
How long till we're back up?

46:55.706 --> 46:56.906
This has never happened.

46:56.907 --> 46:58.841
It's the first time
in 50 years

46:58.842 --> 47:00.776
we don't have eyes
on the ship.

47:00.777 --> 47:02.378
Both of them?

47:02.379 --> 47:04.042
What?

47:05.148 --> 47:07.483
Stokes is working
with Krueger.

47:07.484 --> 47:09.185
She broke him out.

47:09.186 --> 47:11.053
Yes, I was wrong, Harris,

47:11.054 --> 47:14.123
but I was so certain
you were hiding something,

47:14.124 --> 47:16.258
I couldn't see what
she was up to.

47:16.259 --> 47:17.860
Who's she working for?

47:17.861 --> 47:19.837
Well, I thought it was me!

47:21.231 --> 47:24.066
You just focus on getting
<i>Ascension</i> back online.

47:24.067 --> 47:25.367
You were gonna kill me.

47:25.368 --> 47:27.737
And now I'm giving
you the opportunity

47:27.738 --> 47:28.985
to get your job back.

47:30.407 --> 47:34.043
If this girl is really
responsible for all of this,

47:34.044 --> 47:37.235
you've made a
remarkable breakthrough.

47:40.417 --> 47:42.351
Until the comm
systems are back up,

47:42.352 --> 47:43.753
we're going deck to deck,

47:43.754 --> 47:45.354
checking all the
essential systems.

47:45.355 --> 47:46.856
So far, no sign
of sabotage.

47:46.857 --> 47:49.325
I remember what happened
in the wake of the fire.

47:49.326 --> 47:51.260
Crisis brings out
the worst in people.

47:51.261 --> 47:54.163
I'm depending on your safety
officers to keep the peace.

47:54.164 --> 47:56.132
Dr. Bryce, what's
happening to my ship?

47:56.133 --> 47:57.867
It was a massive
power discharge.

47:57.868 --> 48:00.336
I haven't found what
originated it or what caused it.

48:00.337 --> 48:02.371
- Could it be the reactor?
- No, no!

48:02.372 --> 48:03.539
The shielding is holding.

48:03.540 --> 48:05.241
The cooling levels
are acceptable.

48:05.242 --> 48:07.276
Mrs. Vanderhaus,
are we still on course?

48:07.277 --> 48:09.779
I'll know once the nav
computer's working.

48:09.780 --> 48:11.180
Right now, we're
flying blind.

48:11.181 --> 48:12.181
XO on deck!

48:12.182 --> 48:13.382
It's about time, Gault!

48:13.383 --> 48:15.184
Coordinate a
ship-wide damage survey

48:15.185 --> 48:16.418
with Mrs. Vanderhaus.

48:16.419 --> 48:19.155
Sir, shouldn't I be
helping out below decks?

48:19.156 --> 48:20.189
People are panicking.

48:20.190 --> 48:22.024
You don't choose
your assignment.

48:22.025 --> 48:23.492
Next time you step
on my bridge,

48:23.493 --> 48:25.494
you better not smell
like a distillery.

48:25.495 --> 48:27.229
Are we clear?

48:33.370 --> 48:36.939
Jackie, help me take
the rest of these supplies

48:36.940 --> 48:38.174
down to Dr. Bryce.

48:38.175 --> 48:39.722
Who's Jackie?

48:40.544 --> 48:42.912
Who are you?
What do you want?

48:42.913 --> 48:45.948
I was working on the midline
when it blew a circuit.

48:45.949 --> 48:48.551
I thought, hell, I've never
been in the officer's lounge.

48:48.552 --> 48:50.219
They've got some
nice perks here.

48:50.220 --> 48:51.821
The lounge is closed.

48:51.822 --> 48:53.522
I'm taking this to medical.

48:53.523 --> 48:55.825
Oh, feeling charitable?

48:55.826 --> 48:57.393
I just got off the comm.

48:57.394 --> 49:01.063
The safety officers are
coming to take these supplies.

49:01.064 --> 49:04.359
That's a cute trick, with
the comms being down and all.

49:08.605 --> 49:11.607
What's the matter?
Are you afraid?

49:11.608 --> 49:12.975
(grunting)

49:12.976 --> 49:14.910
Let go!

49:14.911 --> 49:17.373
(grunting)

49:20.917 --> 49:22.511
(groaning)

49:24.221 --> 49:28.556
You bitch!
That hurt!

49:30.927 --> 49:32.383
(groaning)

49:38.235 --> 49:42.238
Oh my god!

49:42.239 --> 49:43.873
It's illuminated!

49:43.874 --> 49:46.542
My father had it hardwired
into the ship's reactor

49:46.543 --> 49:49.545
in order to ensure the illusion
would never be shattered,

49:49.546 --> 49:52.147
no matter what happened
on the outside.

49:52.148 --> 49:53.449
So they don't know.

49:53.450 --> 49:56.151
Carrillo, have supply bring up
the spools of 220.

49:56.152 --> 49:58.888
We're gonna tap into
the ship's nuclear reactor.

49:58.889 --> 50:00.322
Ok, right away!

50:00.323 --> 50:02.157
You look surprised
to see me.

50:02.158 --> 50:04.627
This isn't the sort of
job you get fired from.

50:04.628 --> 50:07.363
Did you think about that
when you sold me out?

50:07.364 --> 50:09.331
Did you consider
my wife, my son?

50:09.332 --> 50:11.233
Harris...

50:11.234 --> 50:12.516
Get the 220.

50:28.051 --> 50:29.749
What the hell is that?

50:34.624 --> 50:39.133
(♪ Man singing rock
on PA, indistinct ♪)

51:50.367 --> 51:53.245
<i>(crying):
It's all right here!</i>

52:05.782 --> 52:08.584
Sir, are you ok?

52:08.585 --> 52:11.086
You're bleeding.

52:11.087 --> 52:13.055
Um, I need painkillers.

52:13.056 --> 52:16.158
Acetaminophen, ibuprofen?

52:16.159 --> 52:17.659
As strong as you got.

52:17.660 --> 52:19.495
If you want
anything stronger,

52:19.496 --> 52:21.430
You have to have
a prescription.

52:21.431 --> 52:24.333
- Ow!
- Hey!

52:24.334 --> 52:26.568
Painkillers!

52:26.569 --> 52:27.703
Painkillers.
Ow!

52:27.704 --> 52:29.238
Don't hurt him!

52:29.239 --> 52:31.799
Don't... don't hurt him!
I'll get them.

52:37.313 --> 52:39.671
It's fried!

52:41.384 --> 52:43.846
Electrical is at 40%!

52:48.358 --> 52:50.759
Environmental, 30%!

52:50.760 --> 52:52.562
Come on!

52:54.130 --> 52:55.230
Come on!

52:55.231 --> 52:57.733
Cryogenic, no response!

52:57.734 --> 52:58.767
(beeping)

52:58.768 --> 53:00.302
Scrubber room, no response.

53:00.303 --> 53:02.671
Are you gonna tell
me what happened?

53:02.672 --> 53:05.174
I was caught in the surge.

53:05.175 --> 53:07.309
Since when does an
electrical shock do that?

53:07.310 --> 53:09.424
It doesn't!

53:14.317 --> 53:16.785
(breathing shallowly)

53:16.786 --> 53:18.587
Oh! Oh god!

53:18.588 --> 53:20.911
Hit the light!
Hit the light behind you!

53:22.592 --> 53:23.792
(groaning)

53:23.793 --> 53:25.327
Lay down!

53:25.328 --> 53:28.330
(muttering, indistinct)

53:28.331 --> 53:30.632
<i>(whispering):
Ok, all right.</i>

53:30.633 --> 53:32.297
(groaning)

53:34.370 --> 53:36.872
Must everything on
this infernal planet

53:36.873 --> 53:39.174
be cocooned in plastic?

53:39.175 --> 53:41.710
Listen, you need
to take this.

53:41.711 --> 53:43.112
What is it?

53:43.113 --> 53:45.280
If you're in trouble,

53:45.281 --> 53:47.382
You press and you
hold down number 1, ok?

53:47.383 --> 53:49.485
- Ok.
- It's on speed dial.

53:49.486 --> 53:51.353
Someone will come
who can help you.

53:51.354 --> 53:52.387
Ok.

53:52.388 --> 53:53.655
Oh god!

53:53.656 --> 53:56.458
Use it now,
if it's so damn helpful!

53:56.459 --> 53:59.695
I don't wanna involve
her if I don't have to.

53:59.696 --> 54:03.398
We need to get out of the
country. We need to regroup.

54:03.399 --> 54:05.667
Don't go dying on me, ok?

54:05.668 --> 54:07.503
We don't have
a lot of time!

54:07.504 --> 54:08.785
Mr. Carrillo?

54:10.306 --> 54:13.775
So, he wants to tap into
the ship's nuclear reactor.

54:13.776 --> 54:14.910
It seems questionable.

54:14.911 --> 54:16.812
It's already feeding
the star field.

54:16.813 --> 54:19.548
We're just skimming enough
juice to run the monitors.

54:19.549 --> 54:22.851
Too much, and the
stars will dim.

54:22.852 --> 54:25.557
He knows I sold him out.

54:26.589 --> 54:28.624
Don't worry about Enzmann.

54:28.625 --> 54:31.326
The terms we discussed
are still in effect.

54:31.327 --> 54:33.395
You told him he'd run
the project again.

54:33.396 --> 54:34.429
And he believed me.

54:34.430 --> 54:35.464
So stay close to him,

54:35.465 --> 54:37.266
Make him think
you're on his side.

54:37.267 --> 54:40.235
We need him till this place
is up and running.

54:40.236 --> 54:42.282
Why?

54:43.173 --> 54:44.806
The girl.

54:44.807 --> 54:47.176
If she's what
Enzmann claims she is,

54:47.177 --> 54:49.478
The TC group will
be very happy.

54:49.479 --> 54:52.948
- We have a new problem.
- What now?

54:52.949 --> 54:55.284
When <i>Ascension</i> was built,

54:55.285 --> 54:57.619
There were no mobile phones
or satellite tv's.

54:57.620 --> 55:00.489
The R.F. jammers weren't added
until a decade later.

55:00.490 --> 55:02.324
They weren't hardwired
to the ship.

55:02.325 --> 55:05.460
They could be picking up any
transmission in the spectrum...

55:05.461 --> 55:06.895
Radio, digital, microwave.

55:06.896 --> 55:09.498
It doesn't take much
to shatter an illusion.

55:09.499 --> 55:11.366
I need to get to the jammers.

55:11.367 --> 55:12.601
They're in my office.

55:12.602 --> 55:14.603
Take Mr. Carrillo with you,

55:14.604 --> 55:15.885
And Medici.

55:16.973 --> 55:18.690
Ok!

55:18.691 --> 55:20.409
I need those levels
up onscreen now!

55:20.410 --> 55:22.444
(electricity crackling)

55:22.445 --> 55:25.414
<i>(man): Yes, sir!</i>

55:25.415 --> 55:26.982
<i>(Bryce): Ok...</i>

55:26.983 --> 55:28.884
(Bryce talking, indistinct)

55:28.885 --> 55:30.385
Excuse me, Dr. Bryce?

55:30.386 --> 55:31.853
Yeah, what is it, James?

55:31.854 --> 55:34.656
Something's happening
with the panopticon.

55:34.657 --> 55:37.217
There's a
strange broadcast.

55:38.628 --> 55:39.711
Strange how?

55:39.712 --> 55:40.796
Automobiles and
computers from earth,

55:40.797 --> 55:43.710
But like nothing I've
ever seen in the library.

55:52.942 --> 55:55.711
It must be feedback
from the main server.

55:55.712 --> 55:59.348
I've been having trouble with it
since the Ostara celebration.

55:59.349 --> 56:01.550
But aren't the archives
on a separate server?

56:01.551 --> 56:04.853
I designed the system.
I know it better than you.

56:04.854 --> 56:06.021
Yes, sir.

56:06.022 --> 56:08.423
If you wanna be helpful,
can you find Nora?

56:08.424 --> 56:09.825
Her mother's
worried about her.

56:09.826 --> 56:11.693
I was told to
remain on the bridge.

56:11.694 --> 56:13.595
I'm telling you
to find my daughter.

56:13.596 --> 56:15.005
Yes, sir!

56:39.956 --> 56:41.690
Christa?

56:41.691 --> 56:42.891
(panting)

56:42.892 --> 56:45.212
<i>(whispering):
Dammit!</i>

56:47.063 --> 56:49.559
<i>(whispering): Ok.</i>

56:57.640 --> 56:59.755
Christa!

57:00.910 --> 57:03.684
You unleashed an ocean,
didn't you?

57:04.881 --> 57:06.615
Whatever caused that impact

57:06.616 --> 57:09.351
obviously knocked the system
out of alignment.

57:09.352 --> 57:11.853
Councilman Rose,
may I speak with you?

57:11.854 --> 57:13.322
Excuse me.

57:13.323 --> 57:14.623
What can I do for you?

57:14.624 --> 57:16.725
Someone threatened
Viondra in the lounge.

57:16.726 --> 57:19.361
It's not safe here.
I thought I could come with you.

57:19.362 --> 57:21.412
What made you think that?

57:21.413 --> 57:23.465
After the way the way you
undermined me in the council,

57:23.466 --> 57:25.400
You're now seeking
refuge under my wing?

57:25.401 --> 57:27.903
You're dumber than I thought!
Please, I didn't know.

57:27.904 --> 57:30.706
The litany of what you don't
know is too long a list.

57:30.707 --> 57:33.442
What I do know is that
I lost leverage because of you,

57:33.443 --> 57:34.876
'cause you were too busy

57:34.877 --> 57:37.579
being bent over the
massage table by Denninger

57:37.580 --> 57:39.514
to realize you
were being played!

57:39.515 --> 57:40.949
No, let me come with you!

57:40.950 --> 57:42.788
Just for tonight.

57:43.886 --> 57:45.487
My dear Jackie,

57:45.488 --> 57:47.923
there is a cost
for failure,

57:47.924 --> 57:50.906
a cost you are
about to learn.

57:54.664 --> 57:57.099
<i>(man): When you've reached
the forbidden planet...</i>

57:57.100 --> 57:59.067
(cell phone ringing)

57:59.068 --> 58:01.183
(breathing heavily)

58:02.805 --> 58:04.139
- Hello?
<i>- (Eva): Sam!</i>

58:04.140 --> 58:06.375
<i>Where are you?
What's going on?</i>

58:06.376 --> 58:08.510
Things got complicated.

58:08.511 --> 58:10.846
You shouldn't have called.
<i>You got me involved.</i>

58:10.847 --> 58:13.482
<i>You think they won't
trace you to my website?</i>

58:13.483 --> 58:15.417
There's a
long-term parking lot

58:15.418 --> 58:17.486
on the corner of
Lincoln and Fifth.

58:17.487 --> 58:18.942
Meet me there in an hour.

58:20.723 --> 58:23.992
How does it compare
to the real thing?

58:23.993 --> 58:25.394
(chuckling)

58:25.395 --> 58:26.795
How the hell should I know?

58:26.796 --> 58:28.430
I've never been in space.

58:28.431 --> 58:31.833
At least they got
alien princesses

58:31.834 --> 58:33.702
with hardly any clothes on.

58:33.703 --> 58:36.438
I need to... I need to
go get some things

58:36.439 --> 58:38.507
if we're gonna disappear.

58:38.508 --> 58:40.142
Why are you helping me?

58:40.143 --> 58:42.188
(sniffing)

58:43.713 --> 58:46.148
(groaning, sighing)

58:46.149 --> 58:47.986
Look...

58:48.885 --> 58:50.919
It's not just about you.

58:50.920 --> 58:52.821
It's the whole program,

58:52.822 --> 58:55.023
the idea that they can

58:55.024 --> 58:58.460
just engineer the whole
world to their liking,

58:58.461 --> 59:00.996
sweep everything
under the table.

59:00.997 --> 59:02.197
It doesn't fit.

59:02.198 --> 59:04.199
So it's revenge?

59:04.200 --> 59:05.567
Balance.

59:05.568 --> 59:08.036
It's about time
that I did something

59:08.037 --> 59:09.704
that I felt good about.

59:09.705 --> 59:12.896
You really think one action
can make up for another.

59:15.845 --> 59:17.613
I hope so.

59:22.752 --> 59:25.120
Bandages, opiates,
rubbing alcohol?

59:25.121 --> 59:27.022
Where did all
of this come from?

59:27.023 --> 59:29.224
The council's private
emergency stash.

59:29.225 --> 59:31.893
I thought it may be
better utilized here.

59:31.894 --> 59:33.895
Thank you, Viondra.

59:33.896 --> 59:35.802
(men whistling and catcalling)

59:37.600 --> 59:40.469
I heard about the scare
in the officer's lounge.

59:40.470 --> 59:43.138
Sometimes a crisis
gives weak men an excuse

59:43.139 --> 59:44.906
to prey on the fairer sex.

59:44.907 --> 59:47.642
Oh, it feels good
to roll up my sleeves

59:47.643 --> 59:50.203
instead of
putting on heels.

59:50.980 --> 59:53.215
<i>(women): Oh! Oh!</i>

59:53.216 --> 59:56.084
<i>(Juliet): Come here!
Ok, come on!</i>

59:56.085 --> 59:57.652
Alison?

59:57.653 --> 01:00:00.222
Help me get her
to the exam table.

01:00:00.223 --> 01:00:01.990
Hey! Alison?

01:00:03.693 --> 01:00:05.594
Let's go over the data again.

01:00:05.595 --> 01:00:07.295
(equipment beeping)

01:00:07.296 --> 01:00:08.997
What about the reports
from water rec?

01:00:08.998 --> 01:00:11.266
Nothing significant. Why?

01:00:11.267 --> 01:00:14.076
Let's overlay the downed
systems on the schematic.

01:00:16.005 --> 01:00:17.606
There!

01:00:17.607 --> 01:00:20.241
On the beach. That's where
the surge started.

01:00:21.911 --> 01:00:24.880
Emily, Duke and I

01:00:24.881 --> 01:00:27.682
got into a fight down there.

01:00:27.683 --> 01:00:31.686
Suddenly, a blue
light appeared,

01:00:31.687 --> 01:00:34.256
So bright, it hurt
to look at it.

01:00:34.257 --> 01:00:35.857
Then nothing.

01:00:35.858 --> 01:00:38.285
I don't remember
anything until...

01:00:39.795 --> 01:00:41.863
Christa woke me up.

01:00:41.864 --> 01:00:44.299
She said she saw Lorelei!

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.668
Lorelei?

01:00:46.669 --> 01:00:49.571
She said she
led her there.

01:00:49.572 --> 01:00:51.239
Emily?

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.674
What's wrong?

01:00:52.675 --> 01:00:54.709
Em? Emily?

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:56.119
Help!

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.014
Come on!

01:00:59.015 --> 01:01:02.150
(pig grunting, James laughing)

01:01:02.151 --> 01:01:03.151
It's not funny!

01:01:03.152 --> 01:01:05.136
You're right, it's not.

01:01:05.137 --> 01:01:07.122
This is exactly what
I expected to find you doing.

01:01:07.123 --> 01:01:08.790
Why were you
looking for me?

01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:11.226
I thought you said we
didn't have a future.

01:01:11.227 --> 01:01:13.929
Your father asked me
to find you. He was worried.

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:15.797
Why? He knows where I am.

01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:17.632
Come on!

01:01:17.633 --> 01:01:18.867
That's strange.

01:01:18.868 --> 01:01:21.570
I think he was trying
to get me off the bridge

01:01:21.571 --> 01:01:23.572
because of this
broadcast I saw.

01:01:23.573 --> 01:01:25.106
Why do you think that?

01:01:25.107 --> 01:01:27.609
It was different from
anything I've ever seen,

01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:29.110
Like, the clothes, the cars.

01:01:29.111 --> 01:01:31.746
Your father was acting
like it was no big deal,

01:01:31.747 --> 01:01:35.215
But I got the feeling he was
really worried that I saw it.

01:01:39.255 --> 01:01:43.024
(beeping)

01:01:43.025 --> 01:01:45.627
All right! We're live!

01:01:45.628 --> 01:01:47.095
Full system status report.

01:01:47.096 --> 01:01:50.265
I need to know everything
that's been going on in there.

01:01:50.266 --> 01:01:52.701
This is all over the news.

01:01:52.702 --> 01:01:55.036
That's Stokes, isn't it?

01:01:55.037 --> 01:01:56.638
Where is he?

01:01:56.639 --> 01:01:59.374
Robbed a pharmacy downtown,
grabbed booze and pills.

01:01:59.375 --> 01:02:01.309
His hands were
covered in blood,

01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:03.244
But, apparently,
he wasn't injured.

01:02:03.245 --> 01:02:05.080
Krueger.

01:02:05.081 --> 01:02:09.017
Oh! My problem just
might be solving itself.

01:02:09.018 --> 01:02:10.924
What about yours?

01:02:18.127 --> 01:02:19.995
Juliet! She passed out!

01:02:19.996 --> 01:02:23.164
Get her on the table.

01:02:23.165 --> 01:02:26.201
<i>(Denninger):
What the hell's going on?</i>

01:02:26.202 --> 01:02:27.702
It must be hypercapnia.

01:02:27.703 --> 01:02:29.971
I have 3 other patients
with the same symptoms.

01:02:29.972 --> 01:02:31.856
An oxygen tank!

01:02:31.857 --> 01:02:33.742
The air-quality system
must be malfunctioning.

01:02:33.743 --> 01:02:35.543
When we were
running checks,

01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:37.345
We couldn't get a response
from the scrubber room.

01:02:37.346 --> 01:02:40.281
If the scrubbers are out,
the co2 toxicity is climbing

01:02:40.282 --> 01:02:41.750
with every breath we take.

01:02:41.751 --> 01:02:43.785
If it reaches 5%, it's fatal.

01:02:43.786 --> 01:02:46.087
- And our repair team?
- Spread out over the ship.

01:02:46.088 --> 01:02:47.656
We can't reach them.

01:02:47.657 --> 01:02:49.224
My mother worked
the scrubbers.

01:02:49.225 --> 01:02:52.093
I was practically raised
down there. I know the system.

01:02:52.094 --> 01:02:55.230
- I'll go with him.
- No, keep the peace on the upper decks.

01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:58.066
Gault and I will go down to
try to restart the scrubbers.

01:02:58.067 --> 01:03:00.702
Juliet, do you have
any more oxygen tanks?

01:03:00.703 --> 01:03:02.704
In the lab.

01:03:02.705 --> 01:03:04.372
Hey!

01:03:04.373 --> 01:03:07.142
Why didn't you tell me
about the officer's lounge?

01:03:07.143 --> 01:03:08.626
I'm a grown woman.

01:03:08.627 --> 01:03:10.111
I'm capable of taking
care of myself.

01:03:10.112 --> 01:03:11.379
That's not the point.

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.155
You're my wife.
It's my job to protect you.

01:03:15.284 --> 01:03:17.844
Take care of yourself
this time, ok?

01:03:26.462 --> 01:03:28.438
(car beeping)

01:03:32.702 --> 01:03:34.235
What is all this stuff?

01:03:34.236 --> 01:03:36.204
Plan B. It's my
bug-out car.

01:03:36.205 --> 01:03:38.206
Are you all right?

01:03:38.207 --> 01:03:41.342
We need to get as far
away from here as possible.

01:03:41.343 --> 01:03:44.379
I got Stokes out as a witness.
They're gonna come after us.

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:49.350
But, Sam, maybe we can talk
to someone, work something out!

01:03:49.351 --> 01:03:51.486
Tell them we'll
go away, disappear.

01:03:51.487 --> 01:03:54.422
These people have one solution
for every kind of problem.

01:03:54.423 --> 01:03:56.458
I'm getting Stokes,

01:03:56.459 --> 01:03:59.994
And then we're getting the hell
out of dodge, all of us!

01:03:59.995 --> 01:04:01.429
Where are we going?

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:03.131
Switzerland, Venezuela.

01:04:03.132 --> 01:04:05.967
Somewhere.
We're going full snowdon.

01:04:05.968 --> 01:04:08.528
The world is gonna
know about <i>Ascension!</i>

01:04:13.242 --> 01:04:15.243
<i>(man): Come on!
Get on this side!</i>

01:04:15.244 --> 01:04:18.018
<i>(woman): Come on!
Come on! Hurry up!</i>

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:22.150
Move!

01:04:22.151 --> 01:04:23.953
<i>(woman):
Hurry up! Hurry up!</i>

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.762
We're running
out of oxygen tanks.

01:04:33.763 --> 01:04:35.029
At this rate,

01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:37.909
We'll have exhausted the
reserves within the hour.

01:04:38.968 --> 01:04:40.401
What is it, James?

01:04:40.402 --> 01:04:43.238
Actually, they sent me to
speak with you, Mrs. Denninger.

01:04:43.239 --> 01:04:45.039
We can't reach the
captain or the XO.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.343
Spot checks of co2 indicate
it's nearing fatal levels.

01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:49.911
Why are you telling me?

01:04:49.912 --> 01:04:51.479
Councilman Rose
is in engineering.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.114
With the midline and comm out,

01:04:53.115 --> 01:04:55.850
We can't reach him
or the other officers.

01:04:55.851 --> 01:04:57.452
According to
the ship's bylaws,

01:04:57.453 --> 01:04:59.821
You're the highest
ranking official.

01:04:59.822 --> 01:05:02.122
My position isn't command.

01:05:02.123 --> 01:05:04.425
Ma'am, you're the highest
ranking official we can find.

01:05:04.426 --> 01:05:06.194
What are your orders?

01:05:13.002 --> 01:05:15.336
Radiation alert protocol.

01:05:15.337 --> 01:05:18.473
Get as many people as you
can into the sleeping pods.

01:05:18.474 --> 01:05:21.317
Their oxygen supply
could buy us some time.

01:05:25.581 --> 01:05:27.549
<i>(man on PA):
Radiation alert.</i>

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:31.486
<i>(Denninger): Good god!
This entire section is fried!</i>

01:05:31.487 --> 01:05:33.922
Yeah.

01:05:33.923 --> 01:05:36.057
They called a radiation alert!

01:05:36.058 --> 01:05:38.593
Smart!
It'll buy us some time.

01:05:38.594 --> 01:05:40.461
I'm at 30%! You?

01:05:40.462 --> 01:05:44.232
20! The scrubber room is on
the other side of this hatch!

01:05:44.233 --> 01:05:46.972
Fine! Let's get
that door open!

01:05:49.338 --> 01:05:51.539
(beeping)

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.357
<i>(whispering): Shit!</i>

01:05:53.358 --> 01:05:55.548
Harris, there's something
you should see.

01:05:57.613 --> 01:06:01.497
The ship's carbon-dioxide
scrubbers are offline.

01:06:10.559 --> 01:06:12.327
Get me a full analysis...

01:06:12.328 --> 01:06:15.296
Cubic metres of breathable air,
rate of toxicity.

01:06:15.297 --> 01:06:17.899
I need to know exactly
how long they have.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.467
4% and rising.

01:06:19.468 --> 01:06:22.237
They're all gonna die.
We have to do something.

01:06:22.238 --> 01:06:24.305
What? Open the windows?

01:06:24.306 --> 01:06:26.541
It's completely sealed
with a double hull.

01:06:26.542 --> 01:06:27.642
This thing was designed

01:06:27.643 --> 01:06:29.911
to take the direct
impact of an asteroid.

01:06:29.912 --> 01:06:31.279
If we open up the airlocks,

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.448
They'll use the turbine
to suck out the co2.

01:06:33.449 --> 01:06:36.084
We barely have enough power
to run the monitors,

01:06:36.085 --> 01:06:37.552
Much less the turbines!

01:06:37.553 --> 01:06:41.389
Their only hope is to
get the scrubbers working.

01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:44.125
It's up to them.

01:06:44.126 --> 01:06:46.361
Then we're going in now.

01:06:46.362 --> 01:06:49.030
It's the perfect opportunity
to get the girl out.

01:06:49.031 --> 01:06:52.200
You can't! It's a complicated
process to board the ship.

01:06:52.201 --> 01:06:54.202
We need to create
a plausible reason.

01:06:54.203 --> 01:06:56.337
- They're in their pods.
- Not all of them!

01:06:56.338 --> 01:06:59.641
It's a delicate ecosystem.
Christa is the heart of it.

01:06:59.642 --> 01:07:01.009
If you take her out,

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:02.510
You can't expect
it to survive.

01:07:02.511 --> 01:07:04.612
And if they don't
repair the scrubber,

01:07:04.613 --> 01:07:06.547
She dies along with
the rest of them.

01:07:06.548 --> 01:07:09.083
Are you willing to take
that chance, Harris?

01:07:09.084 --> 01:07:11.407
I'm not.

01:07:13.255 --> 01:07:14.989
Medici, you're going in!

01:07:16.058 --> 01:07:17.492
I'm sorry, Harris,

01:07:17.493 --> 01:07:21.195
But it looks like your space
heroes aren't heroes at all.

01:07:21.196 --> 01:07:22.513
They're just men...

01:07:23.632 --> 01:07:25.330
And men die.

01:07:32.708 --> 01:07:35.308
(alarm blaring)

01:07:37.379 --> 01:07:39.047
Christa?

01:07:39.048 --> 01:07:42.083
Christa, I've been looking
everywhere for you!

01:07:42.084 --> 01:07:44.152
What are you
doing down here?

01:07:44.153 --> 01:07:46.988
Lorelei wanted to show me
what was in the water.

01:07:46.989 --> 01:07:49.490
There's nothing
down there, Christa.

01:07:49.491 --> 01:07:51.659
It's just a reservoir.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.636
It's farther down.

01:07:55.731 --> 01:07:58.433
I saw it rise up.

01:07:58.434 --> 01:08:02.337
What else did
Lorelei tell you?

01:08:02.338 --> 01:08:04.973
That none of this is real,

01:08:04.974 --> 01:08:08.076
That they're gonna try
and take me off the ship.

01:08:08.077 --> 01:08:09.243
Who, Christa?

01:08:09.244 --> 01:08:11.679
Who's gonna come
and take you?

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.114
Globus.

01:08:13.115 --> 01:08:14.983
(banging)

01:08:14.984 --> 01:08:17.185
They're coming!

01:08:17.185 --> 01:08:19.720
Christa!

01:08:19.721 --> 01:08:21.555
<i>(Enzmann on radio):
Listen to me.</i>

01:08:21.557 --> 01:08:24.058
<i>Once you get in,
you cannot be seen by anyone.</i>

01:08:24.059 --> 01:08:25.093
Just get me to the girl.

01:08:25.094 --> 01:08:26.227
Anyone stands in my way,

01:08:26.228 --> 01:08:27.428
<i>I'll deal with them.</i>

01:08:27.429 --> 01:08:29.096
You can't!

01:08:29.098 --> 01:08:31.178
<i>Watch me.</i>

01:08:36.505 --> 01:08:37.705
(beeping)

01:08:37.706 --> 01:08:40.174
Clear the bridge of
non-essential crew.

01:08:40.175 --> 01:08:42.710
Everyone into their pods.
Yes, ma'am!

01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:44.578
James, what's the
status on the comm?

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.113
Still working
on it, ma'am.

01:08:46.115 --> 01:08:48.616
As soon as they're back up,
try the scrubber room.

01:08:48.617 --> 01:08:51.219
And don't stop till you get an answer.
Yes, ma'am!

01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:54.221
Wow! I always knew the true
power behind the captain,

01:08:54.223 --> 01:08:56.290
But now I see it
with my own eyes.

01:08:56.291 --> 01:08:59.460
Councilman, you should
be in your radiation pod.

01:08:59.461 --> 01:09:01.328
That would be a
dereliction of duty.

01:09:01.330 --> 01:09:02.764
With the captain
and XO missing,

01:09:02.765 --> 01:09:05.133
It falls on me to finally
command this ship.

01:09:05.134 --> 01:09:06.768
They tried to
reach you repeatedly.

01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:09.328
I was tied up
in engineering.

01:09:10.038 --> 01:09:11.671
Oh, Viondra, look,
I know it was you

01:09:11.673 --> 01:09:15.143
that masterminded that
double-cross with the council.

01:09:15.144 --> 01:09:16.611
I don't have time for...

01:09:16.612 --> 01:09:19.714
How do you remember whose
face to show to whom?

01:09:19.715 --> 01:09:23.417
You never intended to help me
become captain. I get that.

01:09:23.419 --> 01:09:25.153
But let me ask you this:

01:09:25.154 --> 01:09:27.822
What kind of man would
send his wife off

01:09:27.823 --> 01:09:29.624
to sleep with his enemy?

01:09:29.625 --> 01:09:32.260
One that isn't
threatened by any man.

01:09:32.261 --> 01:09:34.694
Now, get your
hand off of me!

01:09:34.696 --> 01:09:36.697
You are a hell of
a woman, Viondra.

01:09:36.698 --> 01:09:41.415
Thank you for keeping
my captain's seat warm.

01:09:42.404 --> 01:09:44.839
Remove the councilman
from the bridge,

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.608
See that he makes it safely
back to his pod.

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:51.379
Ignore that! I'm the ranking
official on this bridge!

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.281
When I was made
acting captain,

01:09:53.282 --> 01:09:56.681
I issued a state of emergency
freezing the chain of command.

01:09:58.153 --> 01:10:00.199
Now get the hell off my bridge!

01:10:05.828 --> 01:10:07.734
(sighing)

01:10:09.398 --> 01:10:11.860
(breathing heavily)

01:10:22.711 --> 01:10:25.346
Christa! Stop!

01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:05.812
This is Robert Bryce
on <i>Ascension.</i> Do you read me?

01:11:07.389 --> 01:11:09.590
This is Robert Bryce
on <i>Ascension.</i>

01:11:09.591 --> 01:11:11.069
Do you read me?

01:11:12.694 --> 01:11:15.329
(beeping)

01:11:26.475 --> 01:11:29.284
Is anyone there, please?
Answer me!

01:11:32.181 --> 01:11:35.449
I'm, uh, getting feedback
from the jammers.

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:37.818
- What does it matter?
- Nothing.

01:11:37.819 --> 01:11:40.354
If you want the ham-radio
operators of the world

01:11:40.355 --> 01:11:42.435
to start getting
signals from the ship.

01:11:43.425 --> 01:11:45.505
Fix it.

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.968
<i>(Bryce):
Is anyone there?</i>

01:11:53.969 --> 01:11:55.736
Answer me!
Is anyone there?

01:11:55.737 --> 01:11:57.748
Are you alone?

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.675
Uh...

01:12:00.676 --> 01:12:02.776
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:04.879
<i>Christa said someone
from Globus is coming.</i>

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.714
<i>Are you sending someone in?</i>

01:12:06.715 --> 01:12:07.915
It's not me.

01:12:07.916 --> 01:12:09.450
You have to call them off.

01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:11.319
You cannot take her
off this ship!

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.254
It's out of my hands.

01:12:13.255 --> 01:12:14.956
You have to get her
out of there.

01:12:14.957 --> 01:12:16.624
- <i>No, I can't!</i>
- He's coming.

01:12:16.625 --> 01:12:17.825
(footsteps approaching)

01:12:17.826 --> 01:12:19.594
No!

01:12:19.595 --> 01:12:23.132
(panting)

01:12:26.602 --> 01:12:29.503
The scrubber power grid
is blown! Hurry!

01:12:29.504 --> 01:12:31.793
This whole place could go up!

01:12:33.775 --> 01:12:35.476
(screaming)

01:12:35.477 --> 01:12:36.978
Goddammit!

01:12:36.979 --> 01:12:40.134
Gault! Gault!

01:12:40.983 --> 01:12:42.854
Gault, can you hear me?

01:12:56.865 --> 01:12:58.933
Stokes?

01:12:58.934 --> 01:13:00.835
Stokes!

01:13:00.836 --> 01:13:02.361
Oh, goddammit!

01:13:04.906 --> 01:13:07.842
How could they
have found him?

01:13:07.843 --> 01:13:10.344
They could've combed
through traffic cameras,

01:13:10.345 --> 01:13:11.912
Tapped into the
mapping satellite,

01:13:11.913 --> 01:13:13.507
Following us ever since!

01:13:19.321 --> 01:13:20.950
Wait!

01:13:33.769 --> 01:13:36.751
(car honking in distance)

01:13:39.408 --> 01:13:40.941
Hey!

01:13:40.942 --> 01:13:43.411
I thought I told
you to stay put.

01:13:43.412 --> 01:13:44.833
You did.

01:13:46.014 --> 01:13:48.382
Hmm! Is that
your friend?

01:13:48.383 --> 01:13:50.351
Eva Marceau.

01:13:50.352 --> 01:13:53.022
I've heard
a lot about you.

01:13:57.526 --> 01:14:00.328
I've only seen it in movies.

01:14:00.329 --> 01:14:04.498
Guess that sounds
pretty pathetic to you, huh?

01:14:04.499 --> 01:14:05.866
Not at all.

01:14:05.867 --> 01:14:09.751
I'd like to be able to see
the moon for the first time.

01:14:12.774 --> 01:14:17.511
Shit may not have been real,
but it was my home.

01:14:17.512 --> 01:14:20.815
So far, the only thing that
impresses me about here...

01:14:20.816 --> 01:14:22.016
(clicks tongue)

01:14:22.017 --> 01:14:23.784
Right there.

01:14:23.785 --> 01:14:24.985
Hang in there.

01:14:24.986 --> 01:14:28.594
It's gotta be better
than the stockyards.

01:14:29.624 --> 01:14:30.858
We'll see!

01:14:30.859 --> 01:14:32.827
Get whatever you
need from the room.

01:14:32.828 --> 01:14:34.873
It's time to go.

01:14:39.801 --> 01:14:41.812
(sighing)

01:14:49.444 --> 01:14:52.010
You're good,
you know that?

01:14:57.519 --> 01:14:59.669
I never said
where he worked.

01:15:01.723 --> 01:15:03.824
(sighing)

01:15:03.825 --> 01:15:06.794
Is that how they kept
the project a secret

01:15:06.795 --> 01:15:08.896
all these years?

01:15:08.897 --> 01:15:10.464
A honey trap?

01:15:10.465 --> 01:15:15.035
Anyone who gets too close
to the truth, they find you?

01:15:15.036 --> 01:15:17.603
- Sam, please.
- No, I'm such an idiot...

01:15:20.742 --> 01:15:22.610
To think that
I actually thought

01:15:22.611 --> 01:15:25.171
I could make a difference.

01:15:30.652 --> 01:15:33.521
I'm sorry, sweetie,

01:15:33.522 --> 01:15:36.573
But the starchild
must be born.

01:16:24.206 --> 01:16:26.073
Gault!

01:16:26.074 --> 01:16:28.008
Gault! Can you hear me?

01:16:28.009 --> 01:16:30.077
Gault! Come on,
you've gotta get up!

01:16:30.078 --> 01:16:33.914
We have to get the scrubbers
working. We're out of oxygen!

01:16:33.915 --> 01:16:36.517
We don't need them.
We need what's in them!

01:16:36.518 --> 01:16:37.618
Come here.

01:16:37.619 --> 01:16:38.819
(groaning)

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:39.854
Easy, easy.

01:16:39.855 --> 01:16:41.489
Lithium dioxide.

01:16:41.490 --> 01:16:44.825
I remember my mother
refilling the scrubbers with it.

01:16:44.826 --> 01:16:47.094
Carbon dioxide changes
into oxygen and water

01:16:47.095 --> 01:16:49.663
once it comes into
contact with it.

01:16:49.664 --> 01:16:51.632
We have to spray it
through the ship.

01:16:51.633 --> 01:16:54.199
(crew coughing)

01:16:56.638 --> 01:17:00.002
Bridge, I need all
power to the HVAC system!

01:17:01.009 --> 01:17:02.710
Keep trying, Gault!

01:17:02.711 --> 01:17:04.305
(static)

01:17:07.282 --> 01:17:08.816
Are you sure
this will work?

01:17:08.817 --> 01:17:10.260
It's our only hope!

01:17:13.989 --> 01:17:16.763
(breathing heavily)

01:17:19.961 --> 01:17:22.215
(alarm blaring)

01:17:24.099 --> 01:17:25.699
- Christa!
- There.

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.835
That's where they're
gonna come from.

01:17:27.836 --> 01:17:31.859
You're right.
They're coming for you.

01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:34.041
Bad people!

01:17:34.042 --> 01:17:36.143
Bad people like you?

01:17:36.144 --> 01:17:38.953
You remember, don't you?

01:17:42.217 --> 01:17:45.013
Lorelei knew the truth.

01:17:48.089 --> 01:17:49.961
That's why you killed her?

01:17:51.626 --> 01:17:54.053
I didn't wanna hurt her.

01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:58.361
She was gonna ruin everything.

01:17:59.601 --> 01:18:02.970
I stopped her
to save us all.

01:18:02.971 --> 01:18:05.745
(banging)

01:18:06.942 --> 01:18:08.883
(beeping)

01:18:14.583 --> 01:18:16.836
This is the XO.
Do you read me?

01:18:17.786 --> 01:18:19.920
<i>Bridge!</i>

01:18:19.921 --> 01:18:22.279
XO, are you there?

01:18:23.358 --> 01:18:25.092
Viondra, is that you?

01:18:25.093 --> 01:18:26.727
(sighing)

01:18:26.728 --> 01:18:28.228
I'm here, William.

01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:30.197
Co2 levels are toxic.

01:18:30.198 --> 01:18:33.067
The crew isn't gonna
last much longer.

01:18:33.068 --> 01:18:36.103
Listen, I need your help!

01:18:36.104 --> 01:18:38.939
<i>We have to spread lithium
dioxide through the ventilation</i>

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.140
<i>to make oxygen.</i>

01:18:40.141 --> 01:18:42.109
Come on, we've
gotta get out of here.

01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:43.877
Christa, these men...

01:18:43.878 --> 01:18:46.780
These men, Christa, if they
get you, they'll hurt you.

01:18:46.781 --> 01:18:49.383
They will dissect you
like lab rat.

01:18:49.384 --> 01:18:52.019
Please, come with me.

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.153
(banging)

01:18:53.154 --> 01:18:55.289
<i>(whispering): Ok.</i>

01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:58.411
Please! Come on!

01:19:07.402 --> 01:19:09.343
(beeping)

01:19:11.106 --> 01:19:13.914
I want full power to
the ventilation system now.

01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:16.977
(ventilation system whirring)

01:19:16.978 --> 01:19:19.301
All right! Let's do this!

01:19:27.856 --> 01:19:31.046
(both grunting)

01:19:40.735 --> 01:19:42.329
No!

01:19:43.438 --> 01:19:45.240
You can't have her.

01:19:48.677 --> 01:19:51.069
- You feel that?
- Gault, help me!

01:19:53.014 --> 01:19:54.331
(gasping)

01:19:57.318 --> 01:20:01.168
I felt this before
on the beach.

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:08.062
Lorelei?

01:20:08.063 --> 01:20:09.900
Gault!

01:20:10.832 --> 01:20:12.045
Gault!

01:20:42.163 --> 01:20:43.731
(Christa screaming)

01:20:43.732 --> 01:20:47.034
<i>(screaming):
No! Let go of me! No!</i>

01:20:47.035 --> 01:20:49.069
<i>No! No!</i>

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:51.071
<i>Let go! No! No!</i>

01:20:51.072 --> 01:20:53.534
Don't let them take you.

01:20:57.378 --> 01:21:00.222
<i>(man): Ma'am!
The oxygen levels are rising!</i>

01:21:14.796 --> 01:21:16.321
(grunting)

01:21:39.988 --> 01:21:42.172
<i>(Viondra):
They did it!</i>

01:22:01.543 --> 01:22:03.277
(Christa screaming)

01:22:03.278 --> 01:22:05.312
Let me go!

01:22:05.313 --> 01:22:07.393
Help me! Somebody help!

01:22:10.852 --> 01:22:12.203
Please! Let go of me!

01:22:15.490 --> 01:22:17.084
(men grunting)

01:22:28.903 --> 01:22:31.434
(both grunting)

01:22:50.959 --> 01:22:53.004
(Medici groaning)

01:23:16.251 --> 01:23:18.418
(beeping, static)

01:23:18.419 --> 01:23:20.320
Where's the picture?

01:23:20.321 --> 01:23:23.048
Where's the
goddamn picture?

01:23:29.931 --> 01:23:33.815
(gasping)

01:23:35.436 --> 01:23:38.171
I told him
I didn't wanna go.

01:23:38.172 --> 01:23:40.461
(Christa sobbing)

01:23:42.911 --> 01:23:45.946
I told him...

01:23:45.947 --> 01:23:48.348
What is happening
in there, Medici?

01:23:48.349 --> 01:23:49.549
Answer me!

01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:52.019
Medici!

01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.121
Answer me, goddammit!

01:23:54.122 --> 01:23:55.956
I don't want any
"I told you so's,"

01:23:55.957 --> 01:23:58.174
because this isn't over!

01:23:58.175 --> 01:24:00.394
I am not about to go back
to the TC group empty-handed.

01:24:00.395 --> 01:24:01.395
Medici!

01:24:01.396 --> 01:24:03.363
Medici, answer...

01:24:03.364 --> 01:24:06.533
(screaming)

01:24:06.534 --> 01:24:09.069
You're wrong.

01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:14.169
They are heroes,
and they're going to space.

01:24:23.651 --> 01:24:26.286
Call the TC group.

01:24:26.287 --> 01:24:30.345
Director Warren
had an accident.

01:24:35.563 --> 01:24:38.233
(crickets chirping)

01:24:39.267 --> 01:24:41.485
(grunting)

01:24:44.138 --> 01:24:46.357
(boat horn blaring)

01:24:59.387 --> 01:25:03.341
(car tires screeching,
horn honking)

01:25:18.172 --> 01:25:20.669
It works.

01:25:24.312 --> 01:25:26.808
Huh?

01:25:27.305 --> 01:25:33.578
