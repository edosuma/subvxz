Peter, come on,
get dressed.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.669
We're late
for church.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.204
I don't want to
go to church.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.974
I always feel like that
priest has it in for me.

00:41.976 --> 00:43.976
Body of Christ.

00:43.978 --> 00:45.978
Body of Christ.

00:45.980 --> 00:47.012
Butt of Christ.

00:47.014 --> 00:49.381
Aah! Lois,
trade me.
No.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.684
You're not wearing that
to church, are you?

00:52.686 --> 00:53.886
What? Yeah. Why not?

00:53.888 --> 00:55.554
This is what
I always wear.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.855
She's right, man.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.057
It's Sunday. Get noticed.

00:58.059 --> 01:00.125
I'll be in the car.

01:01.361 --> 01:04.063
I'm getting tired of you wearing
the same thing every day.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.864
Look, that shirt's got
a hole in it.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.700
I'd like to point out that Jesus
wore the same thing every day.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.070
And you didn't hear Alice
giving him a hard time about it.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.504
Who?
Wasn't that her name?

01:12.506 --> 01:13.705
Let's just get to church.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.074
And afterward,
you're going to the mall

01:15.076 --> 01:16.341
to go clothes shopping.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.843
Well, you're
coming with me.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.179
Last time I tried shopping
without you, it was a disaster.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.580
Hey, I'm home.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.549
I got groceries.
You what?

01:23.551 --> 01:24.883
Yeah, I was driving past there,

01:24.885 --> 01:26.718
and we were out
of some stuff, so I...

01:26.720 --> 01:28.921
You listen to me,
you son of a bitch!

01:28.923 --> 01:30.889
I've got one thing
in this lifetime!

01:30.891 --> 01:32.691
One thing.
(groaning)

01:32.693 --> 01:35.694
You always say I never
do anything around here.

01:35.696 --> 01:39.064
Yeah, I like saying that more
than I like you doing things.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.100
Dad, I got the rest
from the car. Where...?

01:41.102 --> 01:42.601
Chris, run!
You were right!

01:42.603 --> 01:43.869
She didn't appreciate it!

01:43.871 --> 01:46.071
Oh, crap!

01:46.073 --> 01:47.706
CHRIS:
Ow!

01:47.708 --> 01:48.874
That's right.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.776
I do groceries.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.282
All right, even though
we just walked in,

01:57.284 --> 02:00.219
and this whole place is one
hallway, let's consult the map.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.887
Okay.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.222
Uh-oh.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.491
(gunshot)

02:08.094 --> 02:11.063
I'll bet we can find you
some new clothes in here.

02:11.065 --> 02:13.899
PETER:
Hey, Lois, are you sure
this place is for men?

02:13.901 --> 02:15.134
Yes, Peter, it's for everyone.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.569
Really? 'Cause this-this
kind of looks like a dress.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.805
Peter, it's fine.
Come on out.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.875
Ha! You gaybo!

02:25.278 --> 02:26.612
Hang on, Peter.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.914
I'm gonna go look for a couple
things for me in here.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.115
I'll be right back.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.617
Okay, Lois, I'll
be right here,

02:31.619 --> 02:34.153
standing uncomfortably close to
the unnecessary piano player

02:34.155 --> 02:35.921
in the middle of the mall.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.789
♪

02:37.791 --> 02:39.958
So, what's it like
now that you've made it?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.260
Did you ever have
a bank account

02:41.262 --> 02:42.928
full of pedestrians'
disinterested smiles?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.463
You're amazing.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.999
I'm gonna sit Indian-style
on top of your piano.

02:48.301 --> 02:51.103
There aren't enough verses
in any song I could write

02:51.105 --> 02:53.939
that would express how much
hatred I have in my heart.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.208
You talk like a book.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.111
Hey, Lois,
how about we try Sears?

02:59.113 --> 03:00.312
They got good stuff.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.114
Peter, nobody's been
in Sears for decades.

03:02.116 --> 03:03.782
Oh, come on.
When I was a boy,

03:03.784 --> 03:05.617
we always used to go
clothes shopping at Sears.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.219
Trust me. They'll have
everything I need.

03:12.792 --> 03:13.959
What the hell happened here?

03:13.961 --> 03:15.394
Look out!

03:17.630 --> 03:19.698
(muffled speaking)

03:19.700 --> 03:21.800
He wants to know
who you are.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.136
We seek clothes
for the cold times.

03:24.138 --> 03:26.138
(muffled speaking)

03:26.140 --> 03:29.041
He says he'll take you to
the clothes for herbs and meat.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.676
Well, we can probably come up

03:30.678 --> 03:32.644
with some herbs
and meat, right, Peter?

03:32.646 --> 03:33.879
Peter?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.480
I'm with them now.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.982
No girls allowed.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.284
(tires squealing)

03:43.323 --> 03:45.324
See, Lois, now,
this is more like it.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.326
What the hell?
Why won't this button?

03:47.328 --> 03:48.994
It's the same size
I always get.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.163
Maybe you put on a
few pounds, sweetie.

03:51.165 --> 03:53.065
Lois, I weigh the same
293 pounds today

03:53.067 --> 03:54.499
that I weighed
in grade school.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.035
Perhaps it's this lump
on the side of your neck, sir.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.670
Oh, my God, Peter!

03:58.672 --> 04:00.372
How long have you
had that thing?

04:00.374 --> 04:01.673
I-I don't know.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.842
We got to go see
Dr. Hartman right away.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.677
Oh, my God, what if
it's something serious?

04:05.679 --> 04:06.878
It's all right,
it's all right.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.014
We'll be in good hands
with Dr. Hartman.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.016
He handled
my reassignment surgery.

04:11.018 --> 04:14.219
I think, emotionally, I've
always been a lizard, you know?

04:14.221 --> 04:15.854
And now, I feel
comfortable finally

04:15.856 --> 04:17.189
in my leathery,
scaly skin.

04:17.191 --> 04:18.757
Kids, if you need me,

04:18.759 --> 04:21.627
I'll be on the wall making
rapid, darting glances.

04:23.863 --> 04:26.198
Is this just to get out
of my parents' visit?

04:26.200 --> 04:27.366
No.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.567
(doorbell rings)

04:28.569 --> 04:30.636
BABS:
Hello!

04:34.073 --> 04:35.874
No,    <i>you'</i>stupid!

04:35.876 --> 04:37.409
Oh, hello, Griffins.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.044
What can I help
you with today?

04:39.046 --> 04:42.547
Dr. Hartman, Peter has a huge
lump growing on his neck.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.049
Mrs. Griffin,
that's called a "head."

04:44.051 --> 04:45.584
I've been fooled
by that one before.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.286
Well, will you
take a look at it?

04:47.288 --> 04:48.920
I think it might
be a tumor.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.289
Okay, let's
have a look.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.892
Oh, yes, it appears
that there is a...

04:53.894 --> 04:55.060
Great rack, by the way.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.295
Thank you.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.929
Well, thank Grandma
Griffin, really.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.632
It appears you have
a subcutaneous vestigial twin

05:00.634 --> 05:02.100
growing on your neck.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.302
What is that?

05:03.304 --> 05:04.803
Well, it's
an incomplete twin

05:04.805 --> 05:06.605
that never developed
into a fully-formed person

05:06.607 --> 05:09.074
but still exists as a growth
feeding off your body.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.074
Now, hold still.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.077
I'm just gonna give you
a little topical anesthetic,

05:12.079 --> 05:13.145
and we'll have
a closer look.

05:16.916 --> 05:17.983
(high-pitched voice):
Hi, everybody!

05:17.985 --> 05:19.918
Aah! What the
hell is that?!

05:19.920 --> 05:21.920
Oh, my God!
It's a little me!

05:21.922 --> 05:23.989
Well, it looks as if he's more
fully formed than we thought.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.625
Wow, your wife
is gorgeous!

05:26.627 --> 05:28.093
Is that a foot?

05:28.095 --> 05:29.261
Almost!

05:29.263 --> 05:30.595
This is awesome!

05:30.597 --> 05:32.164
Finally, I'll have an
interesting silhouette

05:32.166 --> 05:34.666
for the beginning of
my spoken-word jazz.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.302
(stand-up bass plays
slow jazz)

05:37.304 --> 05:39.304
I left...

05:39.306 --> 05:41.306
my poem...

05:41.308 --> 05:43.375

This is my vestigial twin.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.974
I named him Chip.

"chip off the old neck."

in the ball pit at McDonald's.

17:48.001 --> 17:50.034
You can just leave me there;
I'll conduct the search.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.003
Meg's right!
Come on, kids,

17:52.005 --> 17:54.405
let's go find Chip
and bring him back!

17:54.407 --> 17:56.908
You guys do whatever you want.
I got stuff to do, anyway.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.910
I got to get ready
for my Bar Mitzvah.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.878
♪ Baruch atah Adonai

18:00.880 --> 18:03.548

18:20.899 --> 18:23.634
Ah, crap, I'm out of beer.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.038
Great. I have to walk
down these stairs

18:27.040 --> 18:29.907
the one day I wore heels.

18:29.909 --> 18:30.942
(yelling)

18:30.944 --> 18:32.376
(screaming)

18:32.378 --> 18:33.911
(grunting in pain)

18:33.913 --> 18:35.079
Son of a bitch!

18:35.081 --> 18:36.881
I think I broke my leg!

18:36.883 --> 18:39.450
(grunting)

18:39.452 --> 18:42.220
There's no way I'm gonna make it
back up those stairs.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.654
(phone ringing)

18:45.057 --> 18:46.324
Nope.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.261
Peter? It's me, Chip.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.264
Listen, I... I'm sorry
for the mean things I said.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.533
Help!
Peter?

18:57.302 --> 18:59.637
Holy smokes!
Peter, are you okay?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.139
These books was already
down here!

19:01.141 --> 19:02.507
I'm not a nerd!

19:03.142 --> 19:04.609
Oh, my God!

19:04.611 --> 19:07.278
We got to get this leg set
and get you to the hospital!

19:07.280 --> 19:09.714
Oh, cool. That's the place
with all the <i>Ghostbusters</i> cars!

19:10.749 --> 19:12.016
(grunts)

19:19.458 --> 19:21.993
(grunting)

19:24.263 --> 19:26.531
(loud grunting)

19:28.000 --> 19:29.600
(high-pitched
flatulence)
(giggles)

19:29.602 --> 19:31.936
If you had only done that
while you were here,

19:31.938 --> 19:33.337
we wouldn't be in this mess.

19:36.975 --> 19:38.976
Mr. Griffin,
you're a lucky man.

19:38.978 --> 19:42.113
If it weren't for Chip here,
you might have lost your leg.

19:42.115 --> 19:43.781
The bad news is,
we did an X-ray,

19:43.783 --> 19:45.950
and your body is full
of a spooky skeleton man.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.853
Gosh, Chip, I don't
know how to thank you.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.154
No problem, Peter.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.123
You would have done
the same thing for me.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.959
You know, Chip, Lois
was right about you.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.627
You are special.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.664
You've got all the sense of
wonder that I somehow lost.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.966
I got so used to watching TV

20:01.968 --> 20:03.968
and looking for tiny
jean fibers in my nuts,

20:03.970 --> 20:06.871
I forgot there's a whole
world out there to experience.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.639
Thank you for
showing me that.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.308
As far as I'm concerned,

20:10.310 --> 20:12.543
you're a permanent
part of our family now.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.213
Well, that sure is nice of you,
Peter, but...

20:15.215 --> 20:17.648
there's a big old world
out there.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.151
I want to go out
and experience it for myself.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.986
ALL:
Aw!
Why?

20:21.988 --> 20:25.323
Well, I'm sorry to see you go,
but I understand.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.625
Oh, we're gonna miss you, Chip.

20:30.996 --> 20:35.066
I'm too tough to cry,
but I'm gonna miss you, too.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.005
Safe travels, buddy,
and keep in touch.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.173
I will!

20:42.175 --> 20:44.709
Whee!

20:44.711 --> 20:46.377
Good-bye, Chip!
Bye!

20:46.379 --> 20:48.579
Come back soon, okay?

20:48.581 --> 20:50.414
PATRICK STEWART:
