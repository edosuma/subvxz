I m-married you?

Noah, I don't know

13:06.845 --> 13:11.053
if you're stupid or evil
or crazy or all three.

13:11.053 --> 13:13.970
But you really should definitely
feel like a complete shit.

13:13.970 --> 13:15.720
-I do!
-Good!

13:18.095 --> 13:20.470

at that party, Helen?

13:20.470 --> 13:21.762
-Oh, my God.
-She was in high school.

13:21.762 --> 13:22.720
What was she doing
out in Montauk

13:22.720 --> 13:24.428
by herself, in a hurricane?

13:24.428 --> 13:26.428
Are you really trying
to say that this is my fault?

13:26.428 --> 13:28.720
Oh, no, of course not.
Nothing's ever your fault.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.929
Oh, please. You are incredible.

13:30.929 --> 13:33.804
I am so fucking tired
of you lecturing me.

13:33.804 --> 13:36.720
With your self-important,
fucking self-righteous,

13:36.720 --> 13:38.679

13:38.679 --> 13:40.804
You don't think I fucking hate
myself for that night?

13:40.804 --> 13:42.095
That was the worst night
of my life--

13:42.095 --> 13:43.845
-Oh, my God. Your life?
-Yes!

13:43.845 --> 13:47.220

13:47.220 --> 13:50.679
I lost my daughter that night.
You don't think I know that?!

You don't think
I've been trying ever since

13:55.011 --> 13:57.679
to try and make it up to her?

13:57.679 --> 14:01.929
I would do anything-- anything--
to undo what happened.

we had fun and...

14:31.470 --> 14:33.512
What do you mean?

14:33.512 --> 14:36.595
I mean, you're not invited
to the wedding.

14:36.595 --> 14:38.637
What, she said that?

That's the letter I wrote to you
the night before our wedding.

15:32.762 --> 15:35.470
Why do you have it?

15:36.929 --> 15:39.679

in the trash

15:39.679 --> 15:41.804
in your parents'
guest room the next day,

and so I fished it out
and kept it.

40:55.970 --> 40:57.762
-and find a way down?
-No.

40:57.762 --> 40:59.720
And then, if I fall, at least
the kids'll have you.

40:59.720 --> 41:01.470
-Oh, my God, no! Wait.
-No, no, but if I make it...

41:01.470 --> 41:02.679
-What?! We'll just wait.
-I'll make it.

41:02.679 --> 41:04.887
I'll make it, okay?
And I'll guide you down.

41:04.887 --> 41:07.053
And then, if you fall,
I'll catch you.

41:07.053 --> 41:08.512
[laughs]
I'll crush you.

41:08.512 --> 41:09.929
-That's insane.
-You're okay.

41:09.929 --> 41:11.387
I mean, it's idiotic.
It's just,

41:11.387 --> 41:12.845
there's got to be
another way out of here

41:12.845 --> 41:14.178
if we just hike back to...

41:14.178 --> 41:15.679
Oh, my God, Noah!

41:15.679 --> 41:17.512

Come on, you can do this.

42:46.512 --> 42:48.011

You should just go get help,

just a few inches down.

44:14.804 --> 44:16.970
Test it first.

44:16.970 --> 44:19.053
-Oh, my God.
-Ah, fuck!

44:19.053 --> 44:19.929

Yes, you can, but you have
to let go of your right hand

44:44.345 --> 44:45.345
and bend your knee.

44:45.345 --> 44:47.053

You have to keep going.

Movement is life.

45:05.387 --> 45:08.261
You know what?
Could you please fucking stop

45:08.261 --> 45:09.428
mansplaining to me right now?!

45:09.428 --> 45:11.011
I'm not mansplaining.

45:11.011 --> 45:12.804
I'm...

45:12.804 --> 45:14.220
I'm... Look, you're hanging
from a fucking rock face

45:14.220 --> 45:15.553
and you might die.

45:15.553 --> 45:17.095
I-I'm just
trying to help.

45:17.095 --> 45:18.845
I am not gonna fucking die,
and the only reason

45:18.845 --> 45:21.428
I'm hanging from a rock face
is because of you.

45:21.428 --> 45:23.136
Because you don't plan.

45:23.136 --> 45:24.887
You don't think ahead.

45:24.887 --> 45:26.679
You just do what you want,
and you don't think about

45:26.679 --> 45:28.679
the consequences.

45:28.679 --> 45:29.720
I don't think that's fair.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.345
And another thing.

45:31.345 --> 45:35.804
What the fuck is up with this
"movement is life" bullshit?

45:35.804 --> 45:38.053
That is just something
that men say.

45:38.053 --> 45:40.428
Oh.

45:40.428 --> 45:42.011
"I couldn't stay
with my wife.

45:42.011 --> 45:44.762

45:44.762 --> 45:46.512
'movement is life.'"

45:46.512 --> 45:50.261
It's such self-serving hogwash.

45:50.261 --> 45:52.261
[panting]

45:52.261 --> 45:55.136
[laughs]

45:55.136 --> 45:56.303
Ooh.

45:56.303 --> 45:58.261
[laughing]
Oh, my God.

45:58.261 --> 46:00.136
-[exhales] Ooh.
-[chuckles]

46:00.136 --> 46:01.929
Nice work.

You can hit me

46:10.136 --> 46:12.845

46:12.845 --> 46:14.929
Helen.

46:15.845 --> 46:17.970
Look.

46:17.970 --> 46:20.261
-[Helen] Oh, my God.
-[chuckles]

46:20.261 --> 46:21.970
We did it.

46:21.970 --> 46:23.887
Come on. Let's go.

46:27.136 --> 46:28.428
Is that the ravine?

46:28.428 --> 46:30.095
[Noah]
Yeah.

46:30.095 --> 46:32.887
Now we just have to go
all the way back up.

46:35.512 --> 46:38.261
So we were gonna have
a buffet 'cause it's cheaper,

46:38.261 --> 46:40.220
but it's gonna be impossible
to keep the food warm

46:40.220 --> 46:42.804
-in those weather conditions.
-[Helen] Isn't the tent heated?

46:42.804 --> 46:45.095
Yeah, but it's probably
gonna be below freezing,

46:45.095 --> 46:47.428
so I think maybe we should
just get 'em to plate it

46:47.428 --> 46:50.887
and then cancel the steak.

46:50.887 --> 46:53.679
Half their friends
are vegan anyway.

46:55.929 --> 46:57.887
I can't believe
you did all that.

46:57.887 --> 47:00.595
-[chuckles] What?
-You planned the whole wedding.

47:00.595 --> 47:01.887
You want to know a secret?

47:01.887 --> 47:04.345
-I really enjoyed it.
-[both laugh]

47:07.220 --> 47:09.595
I'll talk to her.
I'll get her to change her mind.

47:09.595 --> 47:11.261
No, no, don't, don't.

47:11.261 --> 47:13.345
Don't. It's what she wants,
and I don't want to...

47:13.345 --> 47:16.011
Just-just let it be.

47:19.178 --> 47:20.845
[exhales]

47:20.845 --> 47:23.845
Can I ask you something
I don't understand?

47:23.845 --> 47:25.679
Of course.

47:25.679 --> 47:29.512
I don't understand how you can
be so compassionate sometimes

47:29.512 --> 47:33.178
and sometimes so... cruel.

47:34.804 --> 47:37.053
I mean, we all have our darkness
and our bad qualities,

47:37.053 --> 47:40.720
but-but with you, the...

47:40.720 --> 47:44.136
Dichotomy is extreme?

47:44.136 --> 47:45.720
Yes.

47:48.011 --> 47:51.553
Yeah, I've asked myself
the same question.

47:51.553 --> 47:55.095
I don't know, I thought
about my childhood.

47:55.095 --> 47:57.720
My mother was always dying
and my father was never there,

47:57.720 --> 48:00.720
and when he was,
he was so angry...

48:00.720 --> 48:03.261
I just wanted
to be somewhere else.

48:03.261 --> 48:06.011
Someone else. And then...

48:06.011 --> 48:08.053
and then I got to college

48:08.053 --> 48:11.387
and I met you, and, and you
looked at me with fresh eyes

48:11.387 --> 48:14.261
and you told me
how much potential I had

48:14.261 --> 48:16.970
and that I was gonna be
this great artist.

48:16.970 --> 48:20.762
I remember thinking to myself--
I actually said to myself--

48:20.762 --> 48:22.387
"Don't get caught.

48:22.387 --> 48:25.595
Don't let her see the cracks,
and you'll be okay."

48:25.595 --> 48:28.261
-Really?
-Yeah. Really.

48:28.261 --> 48:29.762
And I'm sorry, I...

48:29.762 --> 48:31.929
That's no way to begin
a relationship, but...

48:31.929 --> 48:34.387
I know that now.

48:34.387 --> 48:36.428
You can't lie your way
through a marriage,

48:36.428 --> 48:38.387
hiding from the one person
who knows you better

48:38.387 --> 48:40.303
than anyone else
and resenting her

48:40.303 --> 48:41.845
when she starts
to figure it out.

48:41.845 --> 48:45.178
And then hating her
for loving you anyway.

48:45.178 --> 48:47.095
Because what kind
of an idiot must she be

48:47.095 --> 48:49.929
if she can't see
what a loser you really are?

48:52.053 --> 48:53.845
That's what I did
to you, and...

48:53.845 --> 48:57.136
I put my self-hatred
onto you.

48:59.845 --> 49:02.804
And I'm really fucking sorry.

49:10.345 --> 49:12.178
I was lying, too.

49:12.178 --> 49:14.512
No, you weren't. You're the most
honest person I know.

49:14.512 --> 49:16.595
No, I was.

49:16.595 --> 49:21.095
I mean, I tried to make you
think I was this cool girl,

49:21.095 --> 49:22.387
this cool, easygoing person.

49:22.387 --> 49:24.095
[laughs]
You...

49:24.095 --> 49:26.470
-You were never easygoing.
-Well...

49:26.470 --> 49:29.470
[laughs]
You know, you know what I mean.

49:29.470 --> 49:30.929
Independent.

49:30.929 --> 49:34.887
You know... autonomous.

49:34.887 --> 49:37.512
-You sure had me convinced.
-I know I did.

49:37.512 --> 49:40.720
But I wasn't...
[stammers]

49:40.720 --> 49:42.512
I really wasn't even
a person then.

49:42.512 --> 49:45.345
I was like a-a performance
of a person.

49:45.345 --> 49:47.512
And all I really wanted

49:47.512 --> 49:52.512
was someone to save me
from Bruce and Margaret.

49:54.345 --> 49:59.178
And then what I did to you
was so unfair

49:59.178 --> 50:02.470
because I, I-I brought you
into my family

50:02.470 --> 50:05.178
with the promise of all
of this opportunity,

50:05.178 --> 50:07.095
and I knew my dad
would be threatened by you.

50:07.095 --> 50:09.512
And then I just set you up
to be the obstacle.

50:09.512 --> 50:14.178
Like, to just take the heat,
fight the fights.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.220
I mean, I never stood up
for you against them.

50:16.220 --> 50:18.136
I said I did, but I didn't.

50:20.637 --> 50:22.720
No, you didn't.

50:24.220 --> 50:26.887
So I'm sorry, too.

50:31.470 --> 50:33.470
[laughs softly]

50:33.470 --> 50:35.345
Well, okay.

50:41.053 --> 50:42.720
[Helen]
Can I ask you another question?

50:42.720 --> 50:44.387
Anything.

50:44.387 --> 50:47.095
If you had never met Alison,

50:47.095 --> 50:50.845
if we had stayed in
the city and not gone

50:50.845 --> 50:53.011
to my parents' house that
summer like you wanted to,

50:53.011 --> 50:56.345
do you think we would
still be together?

50:56.345 --> 50:59.929
I mean, would I ever
have been enough for you?

51:01.720 --> 51:03.553
Which answer do you want?

51:03.553 --> 51:05.387
The truth.

51:08.095 --> 51:11.345
It was me who wasn't enough.
It wasn't you.

51:11.345 --> 51:13.720
I said to Jeffries I had
no idea why it happened,

51:13.720 --> 51:15.428
but that's not true.

51:15.428 --> 51:19.970
I just felt so bad
about myself back then.

51:19.970 --> 51:22.720
I'd been writing
that first book for what?

51:22.720 --> 51:25.178
Seven years? Eight years?

51:25.178 --> 51:27.637
And then, when it came out,
nobody read it.

51:27.637 --> 51:31.095
I thought I'd never get from
under the thumb of your father.

51:32.553 --> 51:34.929
Everything I touched
turned mediocre.

51:34.929 --> 51:37.804
I wanted to be noticed
by someone.

51:37.804 --> 51:40.303
Make an impact. Be a hero.

51:41.679 --> 51:43.679
Then along came
this girl who...

51:43.679 --> 51:45.887
she seemed desperate
to be saved.

51:48.136 --> 51:51.553
It was more than that.
You loved her.

51:51.553 --> 51:54.887
Plenty of people fall in love
outside their marriage.

51:54.887 --> 51:56.887
Not everybody leaves.

51:56.887 --> 51:58.261
♪ slow, somber music ♪

51:58.261 --> 52:00.303
No, you're right.
I did love her.

52:00.303 --> 52:04.095
I was crazy about her,
but that's not why I left.

52:06.261 --> 52:08.970
I was afraid I was gonna die

52:08.970 --> 52:12.136
without ever having done
anything in my life.

52:12.136 --> 52:15.387
Now I've done plenty; it turns
out I'm gonna die anyway.

52:16.595 --> 52:19.345
Not today.

52:19.345 --> 52:20.970
No.

52:20.970 --> 52:24.095
Not today.

52:24.095 --> 52:27.345
-Can I have some water?
-Yeah.

52:27.345 --> 52:30.095
I think
that's the fire road there.

52:31.887 --> 52:34.303
I think we're gonna be okay.

52:38.011 --> 52:39.637
Can I ask you something now?

52:39.637 --> 52:41.804
Seems fair enough.

52:43.970 --> 52:46.261
What was it like for you?

52:46.261 --> 52:49.178
-What?
-My affair.

52:49.178 --> 52:51.345
The divorce.

52:51.345 --> 52:54.303
I've never really asked you.

52:57.011 --> 53:00.011
Well, it was fucking awful.

53:02.804 --> 53:04.679
Tell me.

53:04.679 --> 53:07.220
I couldn't take
a deep breath for two years.

53:07.220 --> 53:10.387
I cried everywhere.

53:10.387 --> 53:13.887
Cried in my car, cried on
a run, cried in the shower.

53:13.887 --> 53:16.387
The minute I was alone
for two seconds, I cried.

53:16.387 --> 53:18.470
I couldn't sleep.

53:18.470 --> 53:20.970
I was afraid to be alone
in the house with the kids.

53:20.970 --> 53:23.637
I was afraid...

53:23.637 --> 53:26.261
what might happen if something
happened to one of them,

53:26.261 --> 53:29.220
that I wouldn't be able
to handle it on my own.

53:29.220 --> 53:31.261
Some of our friends
were awful.

53:31.261 --> 53:33.804
You know, the people
who loved us together,

53:33.804 --> 53:35.762
said I shouldn't let
you go so easily,

53:35.762 --> 53:37.970
that I should fight
for you more, as if...

53:37.970 --> 53:41.970
[chuckles] I had any
choice in the matter.

53:41.970 --> 53:45.887
As if it was my decision.

53:45.887 --> 53:48.929
And then later, when I had
to see you with her

53:48.929 --> 53:50.929
and compare myself
to her, and I...

53:53.261 --> 53:57.804
I, uh, I u... I used
to think I looked good.

53:57.804 --> 53:59.845
You know.

53:59.845 --> 54:01.970
And then, suddenly, I just
couldn't look at myself

54:01.970 --> 54:04.512
in the mirror anymore 'cause
all I saw was my wrinkles

54:04.512 --> 54:09.136
and my stomach after having
had four kids and...

54:09.136 --> 54:11.303
I would just think,

54:11.303 --> 54:14.887
"How could you not know
how ugly you are?

54:14.887 --> 54:17.595
Of course he left you."

54:17.595 --> 54:18.845
Oh, Helen--

54:18.845 --> 54:20.470
Don't pity me.

54:20.470 --> 54:22.178
I wasn't. I'm not. I'm--

54:22.178 --> 54:25.845
You asked me what it was like.
That's what it was like.

54:25.845 --> 54:27.804
I got through it.

54:29.470 --> 54:31.303
I made it through
and I'm more proud of that

54:31.303 --> 54:32.804
than anything
I've ever done in my life,

54:32.804 --> 54:35.011
so please don't fucking pity me.

54:35.011 --> 54:36.804
I wasn't pitying you.

54:44.887 --> 54:46.970
You know, the one,
the one thing

54:46.970 --> 54:48.679
that still gets me, really,
it's just that I-I...

54:48.679 --> 54:51.428
I used to think, when we had no
money and we had all these kids,

54:51.428 --> 54:53.095
and we were fighting,
I would look at you sometimes

54:53.095 --> 54:56.804
and I would think, "One day,
this is gonna be worth it.

54:56.804 --> 55:01.637
One day, I'm gonna dance
with him at Whitney's wedding.

55:01.637 --> 55:05.387
A-And we will
have built..."

55:06.261 --> 55:10.595
"...an amazing thing together.

55:10.595 --> 55:12.178
Family."

55:14.553 --> 55:16.512
That's the thing
that still hurts, if you want

55:16.512 --> 55:19.011
to know the truth, that you just
left during the hard parts,

55:19.011 --> 55:21.470
and we never had a chance
to celebrate.

55:32.512 --> 55:35.136
We made it.

55:35.136 --> 55:36.887
[panting]
Can I sit...

55:36.887 --> 55:38.720
Can we sit down for a minute?

55:38.720 --> 55:40.512
Sure.

55:49.720 --> 55:52.053
Yeah, it looks like the road
goes for about another mile,

55:52.053 --> 55:53.679
