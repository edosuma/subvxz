00:05.006 --> 00:06.306
Previously on E.R.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.678
The police has found evidence
linking you to another murder.

00:08.879 --> 00:11.176
Did you tell her you want
to put me in a nursing home?

00:11.277 --> 00:12.852
It's a retirement community.

00:12.953 --> 00:15.609
A retirement community with nurses.

00:15.710 --> 00:18.977
If you don't have surgery,
the flesh in your leg will begin to rot.

00:18.978 --> 00:20.348
You're scaring me, doc.

00:20.349 --> 00:23.241
But being a doctor isn't about
your personal feelings.

00:23.342 --> 00:25.346
But ultimately is the patientâ€™s choice.

00:25.347 --> 00:28.486
But we must offer to do everything we can
to keep them alive.

00:28.921 --> 00:30.662
You do care about me.

00:30.663 --> 00:33.969
- As your doctor, I do.
- No, as a woman.

00:36.084 --> 00:37.329
6x10 "FAMILY MATTERS"

00:37.544 --> 00:39.252
- You can't be serious.
- Why not?

00:39.421 --> 00:43.585
- Barbecue in January?
- You just freeze for 10, 15 minutes.

00:43.801 --> 00:48.593
No, you freeze for 10, 15 minutes.
Is this a San Diego ritual?

00:48.806 --> 00:51.095
Dad and I did barbecue
a couple of times last week.

00:51.267 --> 00:54.221
I'm game if you are.
Let's get some steaks.

00:54.437 --> 00:55.468
Sounds good.

00:58.274 --> 00:59.934
- Good morning.
- You're-?

01:00.151 --> 01:02.689
Andrew. Doctors Greene and Corday?

01:02.904 --> 01:06.273
- Messages for you-
- The first is, I'm looking for you.

01:06.449 --> 01:09.451
- One's for Dr. Greene-
- What's your name?

01:09.619 --> 01:12.455
- Andrew.
- You should answer the phone.

01:12.664 --> 01:14.324
- Thanks.
- Good kid.

01:14.541 --> 01:16.914
- Needs years of training.
- Robert?

01:17.127 --> 01:21.291
A new ER resident is starting
today named Jing-Mei Chen.

01:21.465 --> 01:24.301
- Say howdy-doody.
- Starting in January?

01:24.468 --> 01:28.217
Program in New York fell apart,
and Daddy's got deep pockets-

01:28.431 --> 01:30.174
Sounds like a big donation.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.642
Let's keep that private.
Lizzie, got a minute?

01:33.812 --> 01:36.481
Dr. Greene, the message
I have for you...

01:36.690 --> 01:39.359
- ...your dad left his retirement home.
- What?

01:39.568 --> 01:43.316
I think it's a runaway thing.
No foul play.

01:43.530 --> 01:45.357
- Thanks, Andrew.
- What's open?

01:45.741 --> 01:46.772
Curtain Two.

01:47.034 --> 01:51.246
Another case has come up.
Jenny Cordova, missing for six weeks.

01:51.455 --> 01:54.125
Found her car with Rollins' prints on it.

01:54.333 --> 01:56.492
- You haven't found the body.
- No.

01:57.211 --> 02:00.248
- You want me to ask him where it is?
- Yes.

02:00.465 --> 02:03.964
For better or worse, you've
developed a relationship.

02:05.512 --> 02:10.138
You got him to tell you where the
other body was and to have surgery.

02:10.350 --> 02:12.426
This family needs your help.

02:13.353 --> 02:16.722
He's cold-blooded.
I don't think he'll tell me.

02:18.525 --> 02:19.936
I'll ask.

02:20.236 --> 02:22.275
I can tell you, it's hopeless.

02:22.488 --> 02:26.486
The Cordovas have no option.
Hopeless is better than nothing.

02:28.327 --> 02:29.572
Five of Haldol.

02:29.746 --> 02:32.949
Cassandra, are you
taking any medications?

02:33.166 --> 02:35.324
Seeing a dermatologist?

02:35.543 --> 02:37.417
- Security!
- Stop! Stop!

02:37.629 --> 02:39.123
We need security!

02:40.257 --> 02:41.834
Get her off!

02:43.510 --> 02:44.755
John?

02:44.970 --> 02:46.168
Oh, my God.

02:48.265 --> 02:50.887
- Deb?
- Yeah, it's me.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:42.197 --> 03:45.780
I'm surprised. I thought
you'd get a surgical residency.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.662
- I gave it up.
- Deb, you're the new resident?

03:48.871 --> 03:52.322
Right, Dr. Greene.
It's Jing-Mei now. It always was.

03:52.499 --> 03:55.287
Sorry. Carter, I have to
fly to San Diego.

03:55.503 --> 03:59.714
If you could show Deb-
Jing-Mei the ropes. Okay?

03:59.924 --> 04:01.087
Everything okay?

04:01.300 --> 04:05.512
My father's barricaded himself
in our old house. He's running...

04:05.680 --> 04:09.844
...around in his underwear.
So everything isn't okay.

04:10.727 --> 04:15.354
I'm actually surprised to see you.
I thought you dropped out after-

04:15.565 --> 04:19.858
- I almost killed that patient?
- Sorry, didn't mean to bring it up.

04:20.028 --> 04:22.067
Yes, you did. But it's okay.

04:22.281 --> 04:24.772
Let's face it, it was a low point.

04:24.992 --> 04:27.661
But it did force me
to face the truth.

04:27.870 --> 04:31.239
I was way too competitive,
trying to outdo everyone.

04:31.457 --> 04:35.206
And I'd left the patient
out of the picture.

04:35.378 --> 04:37.834
Your wrestling partner's tired.

04:38.047 --> 04:40.336
- I'm Yosh Takata.
- Hi. Jing-Mei Chen.

04:40.717 --> 04:41.748
She's better.

04:41.968 --> 04:46.346
This is Cassandra Harper.
She came in with intense pruritus.

04:47.224 --> 04:49.929
- Called a psych consult.
- Myers is coming.

04:50.143 --> 04:53.263
- You think it's a mental disorder?
- I do.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.731
Either OCD or a
body dysmorphic disorder.

04:56.942 --> 04:58.602
But did you see these?

04:58.819 --> 05:01.939
- What?
- Burrows, papules.

05:02.114 --> 05:05.614
I think there's a chance
it's lindane toxicity.

05:06.035 --> 05:07.909
She's got body lice.

05:08.788 --> 05:09.903
Classic symptoms.

05:10.373 --> 05:13.125
Applied lindane for
the lice, scratched.

05:13.293 --> 05:17.955
Lindane entered her bloodstream,
causing her altered mental state.

05:18.131 --> 05:21.915
- But we should wait for Dr. -
- Myers. I'll call him.

05:23.262 --> 05:24.293
Right.

05:25.389 --> 05:29.517
- Taxi will be here in five minutes.
- Sorry about no barbecue.

05:29.727 --> 05:34.306
- I'm worried about your father.
- I may have to kill him for this.

05:34.524 --> 05:38.604
- Know how hard it was to get him there?
- You've told me.

05:38.820 --> 05:41.026
- Wish you were coming.
- So do I.

05:41.239 --> 05:44.690
- I'm seeing Dean Rollins.
- Can't wait till he's gone.

05:44.909 --> 05:48.777
- Call me when you get there.
- I will.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.203
Andrew?

05:51.875 --> 05:52.954
Yeah?

05:53.335 --> 05:56.787
Give that to Yosh. Dr. Weaver
will be here soon.

05:57.006 --> 05:59.710
And in the meantime you're in charge.

06:00.468 --> 06:03.041
- What if there's an emergency?
- Call a doctor.

06:07.558 --> 06:08.638
There's one.

06:08.810 --> 06:11.217
- We need a doctor.
- What happened?

06:11.437 --> 06:12.682
Smile.

06:12.897 --> 06:16.847
Scavenger hunt. We need a doctor,
a cop and a polar bear.

06:17.068 --> 06:18.479
- Thanks.
- Bye.

06:18.695 --> 06:21.233
Mr. and Mrs. Sumpter,
this is Dr. Chen.

06:21.865 --> 06:24.783
Mr. Sumpter slipped a few weeks ago.

06:25.202 --> 06:27.989
The pain kept getting worse, right?

06:28.205 --> 06:30.661
Right. It's been hurting today.

06:30.833 --> 06:33.538
It could be a torn meniscus or an ACL.

06:33.753 --> 06:36.244
I already told them that, but thanks.

06:36.464 --> 06:39.002
18-gauge needle and a syringe, please.

06:39.217 --> 06:41.340
- Won't that hurt?
- It'll be fine.

06:41.552 --> 06:45.171
The needle will enter the joint
and aspirate the blood...

06:45.390 --> 06:48.344
...which should relieve
the pain immediately.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.840
Here we go.

06:54.691 --> 06:56.399
That is gross.

06:56.610 --> 06:59.445
Definitely bacterial.

07:00.406 --> 07:03.323
Looks like you got a staph infection.

07:03.534 --> 07:07.746
We'll start you on antibiotics.
You'll be better in no time.

07:07.955 --> 07:09.070
Thank you.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.247
- You're welcome.
- We'll be back.

07:11.417 --> 07:15.036
- Dr. Carter, Dr. Chen?
- Yosh mentioned lindane toxicity?

07:15.255 --> 07:20.047
- Just a guess. Hi, I'm Jing-Mei Chen.
- Pretty good guess, Dr. Chen.

07:20.260 --> 07:23.178
Paul Myers. Thanks for thinking of us.

07:25.807 --> 07:27.432
Feels good to be back.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.514
- Need a trauma surgeon?
- No, I can handle it.

07:31.730 --> 07:35.942
- Patient doesn't need trauma criteria.
- I might as well look.

07:36.152 --> 07:38.939
- Lift. What's your name?
- Tamara Davis.

07:39.155 --> 07:41.194
Let's take a look here.

07:41.491 --> 07:45.323
Pupils are equal and reactive.
You know where you are?

07:45.537 --> 07:48.787
The hospital. Can I
play basketball tonight?

07:48.999 --> 07:52.118
- Let's finish the exam.
- How did this happen?

07:52.294 --> 07:55.745
I was driving to school,
next thing I know I'm here.

07:55.964 --> 07:58.882
- Tenderness here.
- It's my shooting hand.

07:59.092 --> 08:03.755
- We'll need x-rays of your wrist.
- Do a cone-down of the navicular.

08:03.973 --> 08:06.298
What would I do without you?

08:08.644 --> 08:13.105
The Gram stain is back on
that knee patient, Mr. Sumpter.

08:13.316 --> 08:14.430
Is it staph?

08:14.651 --> 08:18.779
- In his dreams. Try gonorrhea.
- Ouch. More like his nightmare.

08:18.988 --> 08:22.607
- You gonna tell them?
- I'll tell him.

08:22.826 --> 08:25.993
We can't tell her
without his permission.

08:26.204 --> 08:30.072
Call Public Health.
They can follow up, tell the wife.

08:30.292 --> 08:33.909
Between syphilis and HIV,
they have their hands full.

08:34.129 --> 08:36.418
What if Sumpter doesn't tell her?

08:36.631 --> 08:38.126
Then he doesn't.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.981
Good morning.

08:58.196 --> 09:01.862
You lied to me. You turned
my life into pain.

09:02.034 --> 09:05.154
I didn't lie. Sorry for
how you're feeling.

09:05.371 --> 09:08.656
You fractured your pelvis.
You tore up your leg.

09:08.874 --> 09:11.081
It'll be a long recuperation.

09:11.294 --> 09:13.037
Give me something.

09:13.212 --> 09:15.538
- Give him 10 of morphine.
- Ten?

09:15.757 --> 09:20.170
- Dean, I want to talk to you.
- Ten is a joke for what I got.

09:20.678 --> 09:22.552
What are you doing to me?

09:23.932 --> 09:25.723
I'm trying to help you.

09:25.934 --> 09:27.974
I don't believe it.

09:28.729 --> 09:31.646
And I want you out of here.

09:32.065 --> 09:34.023
Get her out of here!

09:35.402 --> 09:36.565
You're fired.

09:37.071 --> 09:38.731
I want a new doctor.

09:40.199 --> 09:41.230
Get out.

09:46.831 --> 09:49.369
Excuse me, is there a pay phone?

09:49.584 --> 09:51.624
Andrew. Pay phone?

09:51.836 --> 09:54.292
Yeah. Pay phone. Pay phone is-

09:54.506 --> 09:56.415
Over by Chairs.

09:56.758 --> 10:01.504
- And who are you?
- Jing-Mei Chen, new resident today.

10:01.722 --> 10:03.513
Dr. Dave Malucci. Today?

10:03.724 --> 10:08.018
Kerry Weaver, chief of the ER.
Why are you starting in January?

10:08.229 --> 10:10.435
Could I speak to you alone?

10:10.648 --> 10:11.893
Of course.

10:12.775 --> 10:15.396
My father bought my way
into the program...

10:15.611 --> 10:17.984
...by giving County a lot of money.

10:18.197 --> 10:20.605
I'm not proud, but I'm grateful.

10:20.783 --> 10:24.781
I'm not a bad doctor, but I almost
killed a patient in this ER.

10:24.954 --> 10:27.446
I'm more competent now.
I hope this works.

10:27.666 --> 10:29.290
Hopefully, it will.

10:29.501 --> 10:34.080
Andrew, could you find the
phone book? My car broke down.

10:34.298 --> 10:36.705
Auto repair is my middle name.

10:36.925 --> 10:41.220
- I'm sure you have patients.
- I'm not on yet. I'm doing paperwork.

10:41.430 --> 10:45.428
Okay. I hope I don't regret this.
Give it a shot.

10:45.643 --> 10:48.348
It stopped. Couldn't start it again.

10:48.563 --> 10:51.268
Remember, it's broke, not dead.

10:51.482 --> 10:53.938
Andrew, could you find me
the number...

10:54.152 --> 10:57.486
...for the Public Health Department?

11:00.075 --> 11:03.361
- My wife went to use the phone.
- We don't need her.

11:03.578 --> 11:06.912
Mr. Sumpter, our tests
show that you have gonorrhea.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.078
What? You tapped my knee.
I don't get it.

11:10.294 --> 11:13.580
The bacteria's in the blood.
It settled in your knee.

11:13.798 --> 11:18.259
- Any discharge during urination?
- A few weeks ago. It went away.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.256
- Have you had other partners?
- What?

11:21.681 --> 11:24.848
You have a sexually
transmitted disease.

11:25.393 --> 11:29.012
- Have you had sex with anyone-
- Stop. Stop.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.689
One time. Okay?

11:32.526 --> 11:34.684
Me and the guys were out-

11:34.861 --> 11:38.028
I think that you should
tell your wife.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.983
Oh, man!

11:40.200 --> 11:42.822
Mr. Sumpter, I would encourage you-

11:52.213 --> 11:53.244
Son of a bitch!

11:53.464 --> 11:55.872
- You lying, conniving-
- Come on!

11:59.804 --> 12:02.212
- I can walk.
- I'm sure you can.

12:02.432 --> 12:04.923
- I can walk.
- It's okay, Jake.

12:05.143 --> 12:06.519
But I can walk.

12:06.937 --> 12:09.143
You drove here by yourself?

12:09.731 --> 12:13.266
- I can drive. I want to learn.
- Not right now, Jake.

12:13.485 --> 12:16.487
Let's take a look.
Can you just sit here?

12:21.911 --> 12:24.580
No, Jake. Let him do it, all right?

12:28.084 --> 12:30.955
- She wasn't supposed to tell.
- I didn't.

12:31.171 --> 12:34.421
I held out the phone
so Public Health could.

12:34.633 --> 12:39.259
No one is wrong. Next time
just keep it from turning violent.

12:39.471 --> 12:42.840
Carter, Sumpter's your patient.
Clean it up. Chen?

12:43.058 --> 12:47.436
There's a Jane Doe in Chairs with
Officer Grabarsky. Check it out.

12:48.939 --> 12:50.731
Hi. I'm Jing-Mei Chen.

12:50.942 --> 12:53.184
- Jing what?
- Is this Jane Doe?

12:53.402 --> 12:56.024
Probable runaway.
Won't give her name.

12:56.239 --> 12:58.113
She was panhandling.

12:58.283 --> 13:00.952
She's got some frostbite
and a bad lac.

13:01.119 --> 13:03.740
- I'm fine.
- Look, it's warm in here.

13:03.955 --> 13:08.867
They feed you, they let you sleep.
My advice: take the day off.

13:09.169 --> 13:11.791
- She's all yours.
- Thanks.

13:14.133 --> 13:18.213
- So you were cooking breakfast?
- Yeah. It's no big deal.

13:18.429 --> 13:21.430
- I like French toast.
- So do I, Jake.

13:21.641 --> 13:23.799
- I like it.
- Cooking French toast?

13:24.018 --> 13:27.968
- I'm sorry, Dillon. I'm sorry.
- Jake, shut up and sit down.

13:28.189 --> 13:31.309
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad. Just shut up.

13:31.526 --> 13:34.729
He can talk. Was it grease
that burned you?

13:34.946 --> 13:39.324
What difference does it make?
Put some stuff on it and we'll go.

13:39.493 --> 13:43.111
- You were having a late breakfast?
- Yeah.

13:44.415 --> 13:47.451
- You miss school?
- I'm 18. I'm out of school.

13:48.544 --> 13:49.575
And Jake?

13:49.795 --> 13:52.465
I wanted French toast. I'm sorry!

13:52.798 --> 13:53.830
Shut up, Jake!

13:54.008 --> 13:55.668
I'm sorry, Dillon!

13:55.843 --> 13:57.801
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

13:59.222 --> 14:00.502
No, I'll get him!

14:01.015 --> 14:02.973
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

14:08.273 --> 14:11.025
Hey, Dave. Stealing Weaver's car?

14:11.193 --> 14:14.526
Just taking a look. She couldn't
get it started.

14:16.699 --> 14:20.399
Carter, did you know the
new resident, Jing-something?

14:20.619 --> 14:23.656
Good, screw up her name.
That'll impress her.

14:23.956 --> 14:27.622
- She was a student here?
- She was. Yes, I knew her.

14:27.835 --> 14:28.867
And?

14:29.087 --> 14:31.660
- And? Nothing.
- It didn't work out, huh?

14:31.881 --> 14:35.879
- I didn't go through every student.
- Oh? Why not?

14:36.887 --> 14:38.132
Just kidding.

14:38.346 --> 14:40.920
You want me to back off,
just say so.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.632
No. You guys would
be great together.

14:43.852 --> 14:46.224
- Go for it.
- Consider it done.

14:46.397 --> 14:49.101
So Jake was the one cooking?

14:49.316 --> 14:52.567
I had some business,
didn't get home till 2.

14:52.778 --> 14:54.486
So I slept in.

14:54.697 --> 14:58.481
Jake wanted French toast.
He tried to make it himself.

14:58.701 --> 15:01.323
Damn! Half the kitchen
caught on fire.

15:02.163 --> 15:04.239
And he knows better.

15:04.416 --> 15:05.910
Don't you, Jake?

15:07.043 --> 15:09.748
You can talk now.
I'm not mad no more.

15:10.422 --> 15:13.838
He hates it when he thinks
he did something wrong.

15:15.135 --> 15:16.250
Where are your parents?

15:16.428 --> 15:18.919
They don't ask about us,
we don't ask about them.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.760
Can't remember Pop.
Mom's on the streets.

15:23.352 --> 15:26.306
We see her sometimes.
We move around a lot.

15:26.522 --> 15:29.523
Must be hard for
Social Services to find you.

15:29.734 --> 15:31.773
They got enough to do.

15:31.945 --> 15:35.064
- Maybe they could help.
- We help ourselves.

15:35.281 --> 15:38.401
- Can you?
- I do okay. All right?

15:38.618 --> 15:41.109
Jake works around the complex.

15:41.663 --> 15:44.201
People pay him. We do fine.

15:44.416 --> 15:48.284
- I do my job.
- You do, man. You do a good job.

15:50.798 --> 15:52.625
We do just fine.

15:56.220 --> 15:59.921
- You can't force me to do this.
- We're helping you.

16:00.141 --> 16:04.969
- You can lie about your name and age.
- But can't wear these.

16:05.146 --> 16:08.480
- Maybe I can find you something.
- Thanks, Haleh.

16:10.819 --> 16:12.479
Jane Doe, huh?

16:12.696 --> 16:16.694
- My parents weren't very clever.
- But I bet they miss you.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.652
I wouldn't know.

16:19.328 --> 16:23.824
So, Jane, how did you get these
other marks on your arms?

16:24.041 --> 16:25.156
I don't recall.

16:25.334 --> 16:28.703
You're just a fountain
of information, aren't you?

16:30.131 --> 16:32.800
Dr. Chen, you have
a call at the desk.

16:33.009 --> 16:37.671
- Could you take a message?
- It's the lab, about the little boy.

16:37.847 --> 16:41.679
- Which little boy?
- They said it was urgent.

16:45.021 --> 16:48.521
- I'll be back. Don't run away.
- Very funny.

16:49.860 --> 16:53.146
- Haleh, I don't-
- Wallet. In her coat pocket.

16:53.364 --> 16:57.029
Name's Alyssa Adams.
Address and phone number.

16:58.369 --> 17:01.868
We'll put you next door
while we wait on your x-rays.

17:02.039 --> 17:06.084
- I can't walk?
- Sure you can if it weren't for rules.

17:06.711 --> 17:09.582
So where were you driving
this morning?

17:09.798 --> 17:14.589
- Late for school. I fell asleep.
- At nine in the morning?

17:15.220 --> 17:17.545
I was up late. Chemistry mid-term.

17:17.723 --> 17:20.807
- School pretty tough?
- Sometimes.

17:21.018 --> 17:25.479
- Feeling depressed?
- You would if you had a C in chemistry.

17:25.689 --> 17:28.310
Depressed enough to do
something about it?

17:29.610 --> 17:33.940
You're thinking I meant to crash?
Like suicide, or something?

17:34.157 --> 17:35.567
- Did you?
- God, no!

17:35.742 --> 17:39.905
My parents and my coach
would kill me. Especially today.

17:40.079 --> 17:41.953
Right. Big game tonight.

17:42.165 --> 17:46.293
Against Union, who we never beat.
But this year we're good.

17:46.670 --> 17:48.828
I used to shoot a few myself.

17:49.423 --> 17:51.961
- You played?
- High school and college.

17:52.176 --> 17:56.637
- But track was my thing.
- I do track in spring. I run the 100.

17:56.847 --> 17:59.338
I was more distance. The 800.

17:59.809 --> 18:02.514
Tammy, we were worried sick about you.

18:02.728 --> 18:05.398
- Sweetheart, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

18:05.606 --> 18:07.266
I'm Dr. Finch.

18:07.942 --> 18:10.777
- Will she be okay?
- Can she play tonight?

18:10.945 --> 18:14.445
We're still waiting on her
wrist x-rays. I'll check back.

18:15.700 --> 18:19.283
Coach will keep you on until we call.

18:19.454 --> 18:20.486
I can talk to him.

18:20.706 --> 18:24.656
I'm gonna see about you
taking chemistry over summer.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.454
- You paged me?
- Yeah.

18:26.629 --> 18:30.294
Detective Cruson could not
persuade Rollins to talk.

18:30.508 --> 18:32.963
- Didn't think he could.
- Maybe you can.

18:33.177 --> 18:37.886
- He wants another doctor.
- Maybe you can talk him out of it.

18:38.641 --> 18:41.132
I don't want to talk to him again.

18:43.813 --> 18:44.928
The Cordovas.

18:45.148 --> 18:49.395
Mrs. Cordova's other daughter,
Jenny, was only 19 years old.

18:49.611 --> 18:52.149
This is not fair of you, Robert.

18:52.322 --> 18:55.110
We both know I'm capable
of a low blow.

18:55.325 --> 18:59.158
However, I rarely use it
to such purity of purpose.

19:05.628 --> 19:07.537
- What's up?
- Jason Bender, 11.

19:07.755 --> 19:11.338
Shortness of breath and
mild pain, upper left chest.

19:12.468 --> 19:16.418
- I got hit with a hockey stick.
- I get hit too.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.597
That why you're out in the snow?

19:18.767 --> 19:20.594
We'll fix you up, Jason.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.684
- His parents?
- Mom's coming.

19:22.854 --> 19:26.188
- How's the boy who broke the light box?
- He's okay.

19:26.358 --> 19:30.522
He lives with his older brother, right?
There's no parents?

19:30.738 --> 19:32.481
Have you called DCFS?

19:32.698 --> 19:35.450
I think the older boy
just needs a job.

19:35.660 --> 19:40.571
- Well, are they in school?
- They've been moving around a lot.

19:41.082 --> 19:44.000
We see a lot of kids like this.
If they get...

19:44.210 --> 19:47.461
...an education, they have
a chance at a future.

19:47.672 --> 19:50.839
Call DCFS, see if you
can get them some help.

19:51.593 --> 19:55.377
Mrs. Adams? Dr. Chen
from County General. I'm calling...

19:55.597 --> 19:57.804
...about your daughter Alyssa.

19:58.016 --> 20:00.342
A phone call for Carol Hathaway.

20:00.561 --> 20:04.689
She's on maternity leave for
another week. Take a message.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.057
- Are you a doctor?
- We need one.

20:12.448 --> 20:14.607
- Great!
- Can we take your picture?

20:16.828 --> 20:18.287
Thanks, man!

20:19.372 --> 20:24.284
Your fingerprints were on her car.
They want to know where the body is.

20:24.586 --> 20:27.421
You know, sometimes I feel
everyone wants...

20:27.631 --> 20:29.671
...a little piece of me.

20:30.718 --> 20:32.295
Will you tell them?

20:33.721 --> 20:36.176
I don't recall this girl.

20:38.225 --> 20:42.437
You're already charged with murder.
Why cause more needless grief?

20:42.647 --> 20:45.482
Needless grief is what I do best.

20:45.650 --> 20:47.773
Oh, fine, then!

20:50.363 --> 20:51.692
Wait. Wait!

20:51.907 --> 20:53.317
Look, I don't know-

20:53.492 --> 20:56.327
If I talk, will you be my doctor?

21:02.084 --> 21:04.326
- Yes.
- Then I will.

21:05.004 --> 21:09.002
- But only to the sister.
- I don't think they'll allow that.

21:09.967 --> 21:13.668
- Why don't you just tell me?
- I want to do it.

21:14.180 --> 21:17.632
But I don't want to have to
look at the mother.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.720
Take a deep breath.

21:21.146 --> 21:22.889
Okay, let it out.

21:23.732 --> 21:26.852
- How long you been short of breath?
- Few days.

21:27.235 --> 21:28.315
Any fever?

21:28.528 --> 21:32.229
He had a mild temperature.
I thought it was a cold.

21:32.449 --> 21:36.530
- Have you been tired?
- I get up at 5 for hockey practice.

21:36.704 --> 21:40.452
Lie down. Jason has a
consolidation in his left lung.

21:40.666 --> 21:44.711
- What does that mean?
- He probably has pneumonia.

21:44.879 --> 21:47.251
- Is it bad?
- Not too bad.

21:47.465 --> 21:50.003
Didn't stop you from playing hockey.

21:50.218 --> 21:53.053
- What do we got, Yosh?
- Low voltage.

21:53.221 --> 21:58.097
This machine is bull. Can you
find another one and run it again?

21:58.602 --> 22:01.936
We'll do a chest x-ray
and put Jason on antibiotics.

22:02.147 --> 22:04.603
- Favorite hockey team?
- The Bruins.

22:04.817 --> 22:06.394
Oh, man! You're in Chicago.

22:06.610 --> 22:08.983
You're killing me. B-hawks, baby!

22:09.196 --> 22:10.394
- Adele.
- Hi, Kerry.

22:10.614 --> 22:13.569
Did you see the boy
with the burned arms...

22:13.784 --> 22:16.739
- ...has a younger brother?
- Don't think so.

22:16.913 --> 22:20.993
- Dr. Kovac's patient?
- He didn't mention anything.

22:21.209 --> 22:24.910
- Well, you'll need to see them.
- I'll be around.

22:25.088 --> 22:29.881
Peter, I got a rule-out appy
in Four. Could you take it?

22:30.093 --> 22:31.125
Yeah, sure.

22:31.345 --> 22:32.803
She looks clear to me.

22:32.971 --> 22:35.676
Scaphoid fractures are hard to see.

22:35.891 --> 22:37.599
We have multiple views.

22:37.810 --> 22:41.261
She can come next week.
We'll look at her again.

22:41.439 --> 22:44.274
You fill in the parents,
I'll talk to her.

22:46.277 --> 22:49.693
Good news. You can get out
of here. No fracture.

22:49.906 --> 22:52.444
Does that mean I can play tonight?

22:52.659 --> 22:54.865
If you're feeling up to it.

23:03.128 --> 23:05.251
What's going on? You okay?

23:08.342 --> 23:12.803
I have an exam I'm gonna flunk,
all I do is practice.

23:13.014 --> 23:16.217
Three mornings a week
and after school.

23:17.226 --> 23:20.642
I love it, you know? I really do.

23:21.022 --> 23:23.015
I'm just tired right now.

23:24.192 --> 23:25.770
Let's do this, okay?

23:25.986 --> 23:30.814
You stay here, and I'll get the
radiologist to look at these x-rays.

23:31.658 --> 23:36.036
- You said there was no fracture.
- I'll get another opinion. You rest.

23:36.246 --> 23:37.741
What do you say?

23:42.044 --> 23:44.333
The doctor was Chinese.

23:44.547 --> 23:48.675
I need to speak to her now.
I just need some clothes.

23:48.885 --> 23:52.633
- Alyssa, what are you doing?
- What did you call me?

23:52.847 --> 23:55.219
- I need to get out of here.
- Wait.

23:55.433 --> 23:58.351
You're trying to trick me
just like them.

23:58.562 --> 24:03.022
You're not going anywhere
until I sew up that laceration...

24:03.191 --> 24:05.480
...and you tell me what's going on.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.901
- Let me help.
- You can't, okay?

24:08.113 --> 24:09.821
- Yes, I can.
- You can't!

24:10.032 --> 24:11.407
- Sit down.
- Fine.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.942
Just listen for a minute.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.201
Okay. You are safe here.

24:17.707 --> 24:20.376
Who tricked you? Your parents?

24:20.585 --> 24:22.293
Yes, they...

24:22.670 --> 24:26.205
To get me into this treatment center.
I ran away.

24:26.382 --> 24:29.218
Treatment center.
For drugs or alcohol?

24:29.386 --> 24:30.417
No.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.924
- For gender identity.
- What?

24:34.141 --> 24:37.095
My parents think
I'm sick and confused.

24:37.311 --> 24:41.724
I keep telling them,
"Mom, Dad, get over it. All I am is gay."

24:43.400 --> 24:46.152
Ultimately, it's your own decision.

24:46.362 --> 24:48.189
Mom, I can do it.

24:48.739 --> 24:50.399
I don't want you near him.

24:50.616 --> 24:53.736
I'll be just outside.
Rollins is in restraints.

24:53.953 --> 24:58.699
He's no longer able to get
out of bed. He can't hurt anyone.

24:58.917 --> 25:00.909
He killed my daughter.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.421
Mrs. Cordova.

25:10.929 --> 25:14.263
I don't understand this man,
and I don't care to.

25:14.683 --> 25:17.091
But you have nothing to lose.

25:17.895 --> 25:21.679
If Lindsey asks, I think he'll
tell where your daughter is.

25:23.109 --> 25:26.608
- And if he doesn't?
- We may never find her.

25:29.157 --> 25:32.277
Please. Mom, I have to know.

25:33.245 --> 25:35.118
I'll be in there with her.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.428
- Dave?
- What a mess.

25:51.639 --> 25:53.264
- What?
- Weaver's car.

25:53.474 --> 25:57.852
These spark plugs are ridiculous.
I shouldn't have opened my mouth.

25:58.062 --> 26:00.269
- Look at this.
- Hold on.

26:00.482 --> 26:03.732
- It's the 11-year-old.
- How did you get the x-ray?

26:03.944 --> 26:05.817
Radiology flagged it.

26:07.114 --> 26:09.652
- What is that?
- Mediastinal mass.

26:09.867 --> 26:12.358
- Around the heart?
- Looks like lymphoma.

26:12.578 --> 26:15.033
That's why EKG showed low voltage.

26:15.247 --> 26:17.952
It infiltrates through
both lung fields.

26:18.167 --> 26:19.792
It's inoperable.

26:21.045 --> 26:22.587
This boy's dead.

26:22.839 --> 26:25.543
They think they can cure her.

26:25.717 --> 26:27.425
Parents sent her to be deprogrammed?

26:27.635 --> 26:31.301
- The center has custody.
- Have her leave before they come.

26:31.514 --> 26:34.681
I didn't tell her I called.
She needs help.

26:34.893 --> 26:37.929
- Call Social Services.
- What can they do?

26:38.146 --> 26:41.100
- I assume the place is legal.
- Shouldn't be.

26:41.316 --> 26:44.187
Dr. Chen? We have a situation here.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.062
Get off me! I'm not going back!

26:47.406 --> 26:48.437
Calm down.

26:48.657 --> 26:51.149
- Haleh, call Security!
- You got it.

26:51.369 --> 26:54.286
- I'm her guardian.
- You called my parents?!

26:54.497 --> 26:57.202
Dr. Ramsey,
Second Turn Treatment Center.

26:57.375 --> 27:00.709
- Second Turn?
- Her parents asked me to pick her up.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.209
- You can't.
- I have custody.

27:03.381 --> 27:05.338
- She can't leave yet.
- Why?

27:05.550 --> 27:07.459
- We need to do more tests.
- Why?

27:07.677 --> 27:08.709
She's pregnant.

27:09.805 --> 27:10.836
Pregnant?

27:11.014 --> 27:13.137
- Lab work confirms it.
- I bet.

27:13.350 --> 27:17.893
Unfortunately for you, this means
Alyssa is now an emancipated minor.

27:18.105 --> 27:23.063
- She can go where she wants.
- This is a load of bunk and frankly...

27:23.235 --> 27:25.608
...an obstruction of parental rights.

27:25.822 --> 27:30.365
Well, Alyssa, do you want to
stay here or go with Mr. Ramsey?

27:31.077 --> 27:32.737
I want to stay here.

27:33.121 --> 27:37.333
- We all know she can't be pregnant.
- She's a healthy young woman...

27:37.542 --> 27:40.746
- ...of childbearing age.
- I want to see proof.

27:40.921 --> 27:44.504
- Medical records are confidential.
- You just told me.

27:44.925 --> 27:46.752
I shouldn't have.

27:46.927 --> 27:49.798
Fine. I'll be back with a court order.

27:50.973 --> 27:53.927
- I'll pray for you, Alyssa.
- Don't bother.

28:00.692 --> 28:01.890
Dr. Corday.

28:02.402 --> 28:05.605
Mr. Rollins, this is Lindsey Cordova.

28:05.822 --> 28:07.447
Hi, Lindsey.

28:08.867 --> 28:10.776
I'd shake hands, but...

28:12.788 --> 28:15.872
- Can I help you?
- I want to bury my sister.

28:17.126 --> 28:19.284
Please tell me where she is.

28:20.045 --> 28:22.252
Were you close to her, Lindsey?

28:22.548 --> 28:23.876
Yes, I was.

28:25.426 --> 28:27.834
I didn't have brothers or sisters.

28:29.347 --> 28:31.838
I've never known what that was like.

28:32.850 --> 28:36.136
You know, to be part of a family.

28:42.569 --> 28:45.404
I've done terrible things, Lindsey.

28:45.822 --> 28:49.026
I've done evil things. I know.

28:49.493 --> 28:52.530
But I am paying for them now.

28:55.291 --> 28:57.912
We don't want you to suffer.

28:58.127 --> 29:00.962
We just want to know where Jenny is.

29:02.256 --> 29:03.751
You're a good person.

29:04.259 --> 29:09.170
More forgiving than most people.
Do you know that if I had met you...

29:09.347 --> 29:12.930
- ...Jenny would still be alive?
- What do you mean?

29:13.894 --> 29:16.681
If only I'd met you, Lindsey.

29:18.398 --> 29:20.308
I know it now.

29:21.068 --> 29:23.108
You're warm.

29:23.946 --> 29:25.524
You're loving.

29:25.781 --> 29:29.779
If only I met you,
I could've had you instead.

29:29.994 --> 29:31.025
What?

29:31.204 --> 29:35.415
Jenny screamed all the time.
I was glad to get rid of her.

29:35.625 --> 29:37.452
- Oh, God!
- You bastard!

29:38.378 --> 29:40.536
Hey, what's her problem?

29:40.922 --> 29:45.216
He had lymphoma two years ago.
Chemo put it in remission.

29:45.385 --> 29:47.378
The mother didn't mention it?

29:47.554 --> 29:50.721
Said she must have blocked it
out of her mind.

29:50.891 --> 29:52.682
Are you doing thoracentesis?

29:52.893 --> 29:55.384
As soon as the mom tells him.

29:55.604 --> 29:58.558
- She says she can't.
- Then you should.

29:58.733 --> 30:00.690
I paged Oncology.

30:00.902 --> 30:02.230
No. You tell him.

30:02.445 --> 30:05.779
Don't you think Oncology
would be better at that?

30:05.990 --> 30:08.113
No, no. You're his doctor.

30:09.953 --> 30:10.984
Dillon?

30:11.204 --> 30:12.912
- Keep walking.
- Wait!

30:13.123 --> 30:14.403
- He's coming.
- I know.

30:14.624 --> 30:16.700
- Where are you going?
- Not your problem.

30:16.918 --> 30:19.457
- Jake needs a tetanus shot.
- Sure.

30:19.671 --> 30:21.249
What's wrong?

30:21.465 --> 30:23.339
- What's wrong?
- He gave us up.

30:23.550 --> 30:25.210
- Gave you up?!
- Gave us up?

30:25.427 --> 30:28.263
- You called a social worker.
- I didn't.

30:28.431 --> 30:31.052
Right. She visits all the retards.

30:31.267 --> 30:34.434
- I'm not a retard!
- That's not what I meant.

30:34.645 --> 30:39.023
I swear I didn't call. It was
a mistake. But you guys need help.

30:39.234 --> 30:42.235
I've taken care of him
for years. We do fine.

30:42.445 --> 30:45.696
You have no money.
God knows where you live.

30:45.907 --> 30:48.743
- You've got it all under control.
- We get by.

30:48.952 --> 30:53.116
Yeah, but sometimes not very well.
You're burned, Jake is cut.

30:53.290 --> 30:57.288
Just please let me figure
something out, huh?

30:58.295 --> 31:01.083
- He'll get a court order.
- Parents called?

31:01.299 --> 31:06.091
- No. And she's not pregnant.
- And you didn't write it on her chart?

31:06.304 --> 31:07.715
- No. Did you?
- No.

31:07.972 --> 31:11.009
Call the Gay and Lesbian Center.

31:11.226 --> 31:15.389
Get her over there. Let
her parents know she's okay.

31:15.605 --> 31:18.809
Right. Thank you.

31:18.984 --> 31:23.313
We don't lie about our patients'
medical conditions.

31:23.530 --> 31:27.824
- Her first day. I'll get back to work.
- Good idea.

31:29.161 --> 31:33.907
Are you a doctor?
Can I take your picture?

31:34.125 --> 31:35.952
Who's cleaning auto parts in Trauma?

31:36.127 --> 31:38.700
I know it's not sterile, but come on!

31:38.921 --> 31:41.757
Can I take your picture?
I'm on a scavenger hunt-

31:41.966 --> 31:43.164
Go away.

31:43.385 --> 31:46.386
- Her wrist's all right?
- Just a little sore.

31:46.596 --> 31:48.007
But can she play?

31:48.223 --> 31:51.259
Why'd another doctor put a cast on?

31:52.477 --> 31:55.147
- Dr. Finch.
- Dr. Benton.

31:55.355 --> 31:58.357
She says it's a fracture
that's hard to see.

31:58.525 --> 32:03.484
Yes, it can be hard to see.
Radiology couldn't rule it out.

32:03.823 --> 32:07.274
- I thought you looked at the x-ray.
- I did.

32:07.493 --> 32:12.405
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure. I'll be right back, Tamara.

32:12.707 --> 32:17.037
It feels okay, right?
You think you can play?

32:17.254 --> 32:20.623
- She has to play.
- She has to stay healthy.

32:22.259 --> 32:23.919
- What are you doing?
- Casting her.

32:24.136 --> 32:28.465
- I told her parents she's fine.
- Radiology isn't certain.

32:28.682 --> 32:31.470
You know the chances are negligible.

32:31.685 --> 32:35.055
I'd rather be safe. She can
push too far, hurt herself.

32:35.272 --> 32:37.230
Then tell her not to.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.401
She has too much pressure to perform.

32:40.611 --> 32:44.906
- Did she ask you for a cast?
- She's completely exhausted.

32:45.116 --> 32:49.494
- She can decide not to play.
- She doesn't make decisions.

32:49.704 --> 32:54.580
Her life's about pleasing her coach,
parents and teammates.

32:54.751 --> 32:56.210
I'm giving her time to rest.

32:56.420 --> 32:58.413
- Did she ask you?
- You don't understand.

32:58.589 --> 33:01.162
- You're controlling-
- I'm protecting her.

33:01.383 --> 33:03.506
Her parents think they are too.

33:07.890 --> 33:10.013
That's why my chest hurts?

33:10.435 --> 33:13.352
It's spread throughout your lungs.

33:13.563 --> 33:18.474
- So more chemo?
- It's an option. We can try that.

33:18.735 --> 33:20.609
- But...
- But what?

33:22.447 --> 33:24.606
The cancer surrounds your heart.

33:26.577 --> 33:28.320
Am I gonna be okay?

33:31.415 --> 33:33.455
- I don't think so.
- Dr. Malucci?

33:33.667 --> 33:35.660
- Not right now.
- Did you leave-

33:35.878 --> 33:37.705
Dr. Weaver, I'm busy.

33:38.297 --> 33:40.337
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

33:47.515 --> 33:48.547
Dad?

33:50.310 --> 33:51.970
Dad, you there?

33:53.271 --> 33:55.478
- Dad-
- Oh, it's you.

33:55.774 --> 33:58.810
- Did you change the locks?
- Why are you here?

33:59.319 --> 34:02.486
I'm worried.
You didn't answer the phone.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.234
Realtor keeps calling.

34:04.408 --> 34:07.362
I told her the house
is off the market.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.915
- Can I come in?
- Oh, sure.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.206
Want to search me first?

34:15.085 --> 34:16.746
Why did you hire me?

34:17.672 --> 34:22.380
I'm an experienced physician.
You must trust my judgment.

34:22.594 --> 34:26.129
- Is this about that boy?
- You called DCFS.

34:26.348 --> 34:30.013
We said you would. You should've
told me you didn't want to.

34:30.226 --> 34:34.391
- Your social worker scared them away.
- They're gone?

34:34.607 --> 34:37.608
I convinced the older brother to
come back.

34:37.777 --> 34:39.353
Please, just let me handle it.

34:39.570 --> 34:41.610
See that you do.

34:41.781 --> 34:44.735
- Who's the social worker?
- Adele Neuman.

34:46.995 --> 34:49.283
- Your parents left?
- They went to get the car.

34:49.456 --> 34:53.038
My coach makes you sit on the bench
if you can't play.

34:53.251 --> 34:58.293
- You can play if you really want to.
- It's not broken?

34:59.216 --> 35:03.130
We can't be absolutely sure.
Probably not.

35:03.303 --> 35:05.011
So I don't need this?

35:05.431 --> 35:10.259
I hoped it would slow you down a bit.
But it's your choice.

35:10.519 --> 35:15.395
I can't slow down now.
It'll get better after this season.

35:16.067 --> 35:20.480
You don't want to start resenting
your talent. Don't.

35:21.364 --> 35:23.938
- Play for you.
- It's not that simple.

35:26.411 --> 35:27.526
I know.

35:28.580 --> 35:30.240
Promise you'll try?

35:35.421 --> 35:40.332
600 South Stone. Okay, 8:30.
Yeah, he'll be there.

35:41.010 --> 35:45.921
Did you want to talk to Dr. Kovac?
Thanks. Bye.

35:46.724 --> 35:49.180
- My landlord said yes.
- Good.

35:49.519 --> 35:51.476
His buildings always need supers.

35:51.688 --> 35:54.357
- He'll see Dillon tomorrow.
- Thank you.

35:54.566 --> 35:56.190
Sure. No problem.

35:56.902 --> 36:00.353
- What's a "super"?
- Collects rent, keeps the place clean.

36:00.864 --> 36:04.862
It gives them somewhere to live,
some cash.

36:05.077 --> 36:09.371
If Dillon is supporting Jake,
he can apply for guardianship.

36:09.540 --> 36:12.874
- Dillon! Dillon!
- Excuse me.

36:14.837 --> 36:16.629
- Hold still.
- Don't touch him!

36:16.881 --> 36:19.454
Where are you taking him? Stop!

36:21.803 --> 36:25.338
- You're scaring him!
- Adele Neuman, DCFS.

36:25.557 --> 36:28.474
- He's going to an emergency center.
- Don't take him!

36:28.685 --> 36:31.971
- I won't release him.
- He's been neglected.

36:32.147 --> 36:34.389
I'm obligated to protect him.

36:34.566 --> 36:38.398
- I never neglected my brother.
- I found him a job. They'll be fine.

36:38.862 --> 36:41.864
- Let him go!
- I don't want to arrest you.

36:42.074 --> 36:43.983
He must have protective care.

36:44.410 --> 36:48.538
- Just let me go with him!
- I'm sorry.

36:48.748 --> 36:53.291
- Don't leave me...
- Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

37:00.093 --> 37:02.252
I'll be right behind you.

37:03.764 --> 37:07.049
Those two only have each other.

37:07.267 --> 37:10.138
I know that. But I have to do it.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.228
I'll be right behind you.

37:12.439 --> 37:17.315
I'm gonna find you.
I'll be right behind you.

37:17.528 --> 37:22.237
I promise I'll find you!
Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid!

37:22.450 --> 37:28.121
Don't be scared!
Don't be scared, Jake!

37:28.331 --> 37:31.700
Don't worry. We'll get him back.

37:39.593 --> 37:41.135
You wanted to see me?

37:42.972 --> 37:44.051
I'm sick.

37:44.849 --> 37:48.977
- No more games. What do you want?
- The games.

37:51.230 --> 37:53.472
They're no fun anymore.

37:54.442 --> 37:56.435
Not even that last one.

37:59.823 --> 38:01.483
Dr. Corday...

38:07.956 --> 38:09.866
That day on the road...

38:10.501 --> 38:12.743
...you should've let me die.

38:14.505 --> 38:16.663
That's what I want.

38:19.635 --> 38:23.764
Shannon Murphy, 26.
Slipped into a polar-bear pit.

38:23.973 --> 38:25.349
- Polar bear?
- At the zoo.

38:25.558 --> 38:27.765
He was gentle. Licked my face.

38:27.977 --> 38:31.263
They got a picture of the polar bear.
I got one with the polar bear.

38:31.481 --> 38:35.099
- This that stupid scavenger hunt?
- Stupid? I won $1000.

38:35.318 --> 38:38.652
- You broke both your ankles.
- Forearm fracture.

38:38.864 --> 38:41.070
We started an IV. Morphine.

38:41.283 --> 38:45.198
- Want this one?
- I've done enough casting for one day.

38:45.371 --> 38:48.740
The lady who burned her butt's
screaming for a doctor.

38:48.958 --> 38:51.710
- You're not a doctor?
- I won't tell if you won't.

38:51.919 --> 38:54.493
Oh, my God! Where's my camera?

38:54.714 --> 38:58.332
Somebody give me a camera!
It's worth $1000!

38:58.551 --> 39:00.710
Make her split it with us.

39:04.307 --> 39:09.515
- I heard what happened. I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

39:10.564 --> 39:12.770
It might not make sense to us.

39:12.983 --> 39:17.895
In a difficult family situation,
we use DCFS's expertise.

39:18.114 --> 39:21.814
- We defer to their judgment.
- You don't break up families.

39:22.034 --> 39:24.739
Sometimes we do. It's complicated.

39:34.256 --> 39:37.257
My wife and kids were taken.

39:37.884 --> 39:38.916
In the war?

39:40.846 --> 39:41.877
Yeah.

39:43.098 --> 39:44.592
And then killed.

39:46.936 --> 39:49.177
You don't break up families.

39:55.361 --> 39:59.739
- So much for the retirement community.
- I gave it a try.

39:59.949 --> 40:04.861
- You were only there a week.
- Longest week of my life.

40:05.705 --> 40:10.617
- What will you do now?
- I'll get by. Don't trouble yourself.

40:11.169 --> 40:14.954
- It's no trouble.
- Yeah, like hell!

40:16.925 --> 40:20.377
You move in with that girl yet?
Elizabeth?

40:21.639 --> 40:23.098
Not yet.

40:25.726 --> 40:29.641
I've been thinking-
We never talked about it...

40:29.856 --> 40:32.561
Maybe you should live with me
in Chicago.

40:33.359 --> 40:34.558
For a while.

40:34.778 --> 40:38.645
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.

40:38.824 --> 40:42.738
The weather could be better.
It's a great city.

40:42.953 --> 40:45.788
You'd be closer to Rachel and to me.

40:45.998 --> 40:48.667
- For a while?
- As long as you like.

40:49.668 --> 40:52.919
- I won't sell this house.
- How could you?

40:53.673 --> 40:57.670
Answering the door in underwear
scares off buyers.

40:58.177 --> 40:59.969
I suppose so.

41:01.014 --> 41:02.757
Chicago, huh?

41:05.268 --> 41:10.144
- You need tune-ups on a timely basis.
- Did you get it started?

41:10.357 --> 41:13.441
- It won't break down?
- I can at least fix cars.

41:13.652 --> 41:15.775
- What?
- You're good to go, boss.

41:15.988 --> 41:18.823
- Thank you, Dr. Malucci.
- My pleasure.

41:19.033 --> 41:23.611
- Was your first day all right?
- Feels like I never left.

41:23.829 --> 41:27.495
- You guys want to go eat?
- I don't think so.

41:27.708 --> 41:30.745
- You working tomorrow?
- Me? Yeah.

41:31.004 --> 41:33.210
What a coincidence! So am I.

41:33.381 --> 41:35.006
See you, Carter.

41:36.342 --> 41:39.462
- Do I have to warn you about him?
- Please!

41:39.679 --> 41:41.672
How was your first day?

41:41.848 --> 41:44.304
Well, I wish I could have done
more for Alyssa.

41:44.518 --> 41:47.602
- At least you did something.
- I guess so.

41:47.813 --> 41:52.724
- Why did you come back?
- My program in New York closed.

41:53.068 --> 41:55.738
No, no.
I mean, to medicine.

41:57.114 --> 42:00.733
Four months after I quit,
I was on a subway.

42:00.910 --> 42:04.778
A guy in his forties
went into cardiac arrest.

42:04.998 --> 42:08.414
He was dying.
Everyone just stared at him.

42:08.626 --> 42:12.043
I suddenly realized,
"I know what to do! "

42:12.255 --> 42:14.129
Jumped in, saved his life.

42:14.341 --> 42:16.713
- It's a great feeling.
- It can be.

42:16.927 --> 42:18.801
Then I figured...

42:19.263 --> 42:22.098
I'm pretty good at this. Why waste it?

42:22.308 --> 42:25.843
- Deb, you haven't changed a bit.
- It's Jing-Mei.

42:27.146 --> 42:29.103
Good night, Jing-Mei.

42:29.357 --> 42:30.436
Good night.

42:30.650 --> 42:34.434
Oh, and Deb? Welcome back.

42:39.159 --> 42:40.617
Morphine.

42:43.663 --> 42:46.534
100 mg injected into your bloodstream.

42:47.251 --> 42:51.628
You'll simply drift away.
Won't even hurt.

42:51.839 --> 42:53.666
Is that an offer?

42:55.301 --> 42:57.970
If you tell me where the body is.

42:58.637 --> 43:03.549
- Why do you care so much?
- Were you serious or not?

43:04.143 --> 43:08.722
Won't you get into trouble?
The Hippocratic Oath and all?

43:08.940 --> 43:10.933
You're worried about me?

43:13.320 --> 43:14.600
But I know you.

43:14.988 --> 43:19.318
As soon as you get what you want,
you'll just stop.

43:20.077 --> 43:22.782
- I won't.
- But how do I know?

43:24.039 --> 43:27.159
Are you gonna promise me, Dr. Corday?

43:27.376 --> 43:30.330
Believe me. You'll know.

43:31.172 --> 43:33.330
You'll feel yourself going.

43:34.759 --> 43:37.843
I hope you have breath enough
to tell me.

43:38.096 --> 43:40.088
What if I don't?

43:41.099 --> 43:45.263
I'll crack open your chest
and bring you back to life.

43:45.562 --> 43:46.641
Okay.

43:48.148 --> 43:49.179
Let's do it.

43:54.780 --> 43:58.992
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Are you?

44:04.707 --> 44:07.412
I'm glad it's you, Elizabeth.

44:10.630 --> 44:12.421
Where is she, Dean?

44:23.087 --> 44:26.154
