00:01.568 --> 00:03.135
<i>Previously on:</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:04.636
So, what happened
between you and your girl?

00:04.638 --> 00:07.473
She wanted to get married, and
I'm just not sure I'm ready.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.008
That's the same reason
I lost lyndsey.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.410
You got to get her back.
Don't make the same
mistake I did.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.946
I am gonna ask lyndsey
to marry me.

00:13.948 --> 00:16.882
Yeah, I just have
to get a ring.
I got a ring you could have.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.851
You must be here
to see your friend larry,

00:18.853 --> 00:20.419
Who is also here.

00:21.287 --> 00:24.556
Lyndsey macelroy,
will you marry me?

00:24.558 --> 00:26.759
Yes, I will marry you!

00:26.761 --> 00:28.694
(lyndsey laughing)

00:32.198 --> 00:33.966
What's going on down here?

00:33.968 --> 00:36.268
I got up to pee
and I heard moaning.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.770
No, you heard crying.

00:37.772 --> 00:40.639
(woman moans sensually on tv)

00:40.641 --> 00:43.075
And moaning.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.411
You're watching porn
at 3:00 in the morning?

00:45.413 --> 00:47.212
No, it's that
soft-core flick

00:47.214 --> 00:49.415
That lyndsey made
back in the '90s,

00:49.417 --> 00:51.683
<i>Cinnamon's buns.</i>

00:51.685 --> 00:55.187
Nothing brings me back
like hearing her fake an orgasm.

00:55.189 --> 00:58.023
Oh, listen, I know
that breakups are hard, but...

00:58.025 --> 01:00.659
Uh, please tell me
those were for crying.

01:01.694 --> 01:02.961
Oh, yes, yes, uh, yes.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.497
Uh, uh, crying, yes,
very upset, very upset, yes.

01:05.499 --> 01:08.901
Wow, you know, you're
a classy guy, alan.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.803
It's hard to understand
why she accepted

01:10.805 --> 01:12.604
Larry's proposal and not yours.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.441
Technically, I never
actually proposed.

01:15.443 --> 01:18.343
What?
Well, when I got there
he was already doing it,

01:18.345 --> 01:21.513
So I just figured I'd chalk
this one up as another loss

01:21.515 --> 01:22.915
And move on.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.751
Universe: 82,223;

01:25.753 --> 01:27.519
Alan: 12.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.388
Come on, you're exaggerating.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.623
You have not had 12 victories.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.459
Yes, I have.

01:33.461 --> 01:37.429
Uh, my son, plus the
number of years I've
lived here rent-free.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.398
I can't believe
you just stood there

01:39.400 --> 01:41.433
While another guy
proposed to your girl

01:41.435 --> 01:42.868
And you didn't say anything.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.770
There's nothing
I can do about it.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.406
Larry's the one
frosting her muffins now.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.776
Have we learned nothing
from <i>cinnamon's buns?</i>

01:51.644 --> 01:54.079
She told master baker no

01:54.081 --> 01:55.948
Five times!

01:55.950 --> 01:58.016
Did he listen? No!

01:59.652 --> 02:02.588
No, the only reason lyndsey
settled for larry

02:02.590 --> 02:05.858
Is 'cause she didn't know
she could settle for you!

02:05.860 --> 02:07.626
You're right. I mean,
you're a handsome billionaire,

02:07.628 --> 02:08.894
And    <i>y</i>settled for me.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.797
She's just a-a-a divorced,

02:11.799 --> 02:13.499
Middle-aged lush...

02:14.567 --> 02:16.568
...Of my dreams.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.171
That's the spirit!
Now, get up and...

02:19.173 --> 02:20.839
Wash your hands and...

02:20.841 --> 02:22.708
Burn this couch,
and go get your...

02:22.710 --> 02:24.910
Surprisingly flexible
girlfriend back.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.812
You're right, you're right.
Thanks, walden.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.514
Lyndsey (on video):
Oh, master baker,

02:28.516 --> 02:31.683
Would you like to watch while
I train this lovely young maiden

02:31.685 --> 02:33.685
To churn your butter?

02:33.687 --> 02:36.555
Maybe one more scene.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.758
This is a pivotal
part of the film.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.760
You might need this.

02:43.029 --> 02:47.099
This scene's
a real tear... Jerker.

02:47.101 --> 02:50.102
♪ men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

02:50.104 --> 02:52.804
♪ ah.
♪ men.
♪ men.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.280
Hey, berta,
how about a cup of coffee?

03:01.282 --> 03:03.749
No, thanks, I just had a cup.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.052
I don't know why
you keep her on payroll.

03:07.054 --> 03:10.289
Says the guy I pay
to be my assistant.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.823
Oh, oh, that's still a thing?

03:11.825 --> 03:14.126
Oh, oh, cup of joe
coming right up, boss.

03:15.628 --> 03:17.663
Hey, what are you
doing there?

03:17.665 --> 03:20.432
I'm making breakfast
in bed for brooke.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.568
Hey, what tastes good on boobs?

03:22.570 --> 03:24.670
Pineapple rings are always fun.

03:24.672 --> 03:27.639
Yeah. You get the room
nice and cold, and you
play ring toss.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.175
Yeah, and with
brooke's bad boys, you could...
Hey.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.778
Omaha! Omaha!

03:34.781 --> 03:36.248
What? Hmm?

03:36.250 --> 03:38.483
Nothing. We weren't talking
about your boobs.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.486
Why not? You stare
at 'em enough.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.854
(laughs):
What?

03:44.157 --> 03:45.757
(laughing):
I don't... I never...

03:45.759 --> 03:47.125
I'm sorry.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.528
Where are you going?

03:49.530 --> 03:50.929
I got to get to work.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.331
You can't leave--
breakfast sex

03:52.333 --> 03:54.466
Is the most important meal
of the day.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.468
Sorry. Mwa!
I'll call you later, okay, babe?

03:57.437 --> 03:59.171
No worries.

03:59.173 --> 04:01.740
Call me whenever you can.
Oh, god, she's dumping me.

04:02.508 --> 04:03.909
What are you talking about?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.510
Didn't you just hear that?

04:05.512 --> 04:07.179
She's "going to work."

04:07.181 --> 04:10.182
Okay, I know no one in this
house is familiar with it,

04:10.184 --> 04:13.552
But "going to work"
is an actual thing.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.656
It's kind of like "paying rent."

04:20.560 --> 04:22.294
It's not just that, it's...

04:22.296 --> 04:24.396
It's been forever
since we've had sex.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.864
Well, how long is forever?

04:25.866 --> 04:27.232
Two days!

04:27.234 --> 04:28.900
I hate you.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.803
Come on, you and brooke
are great together.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.138
She's not breaking up with you.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.740
Uh, then again,
maybe she is slipping away,

04:34.742 --> 04:36.575
And you're just gonna have
to face the possibility

04:36.577 --> 04:38.377
Of being alone
for the rest of your life.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.578
(sobbing gasp)

04:40.480 --> 04:41.647
Oh, my god!

04:41.649 --> 04:43.115
(jenny sobbing)

04:43.117 --> 04:45.217
What the hell's
the matter with you?

04:45.219 --> 04:46.652
Why would you say that to her?

04:46.654 --> 04:48.053
I'm just trying to prepare her

04:48.055 --> 04:49.955
For-for the harsh realities
of real life.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.725
I mean, who else is gonna do it,
her father? He's dead, walden!

04:53.727 --> 04:56.061
Why are you even here?
I thought you were

04:56.063 --> 04:57.562
Gonna go win lyndsey back.

04:57.564 --> 04:58.997
It's early.
I want to win her back,

04:58.999 --> 05:00.866
But I don't want to spend
the whole day with her.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.637
(doorbell rings)

05:08.474 --> 05:09.508
Alan.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.411
Lyndsey macelroy, I love you.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.479
You are my world.

05:14.481 --> 05:18.116
I want you to spend
the rest of your life with me.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.152
And walden.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.753
You're-you're kidding, right?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.221
I'm engaged to larry.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.257
That's not fair.
I mean, if I hadn't stopped

05:25.259 --> 05:28.026
At that gas station to poop,
I would have been here first.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.495
Alan, don't.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.997
Maybe this will change
your mind.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.932
Oh, alan, it doesn't matter

05:33.934 --> 05:35.200
What kind of ring...

05:35.202 --> 05:38.503
Holy crap, that thing's huge!

05:38.505 --> 05:39.905
That's what <i>she</i> said.
(chuckles)

05:41.107 --> 05:43.709
I know, not the right time.
What do you say?

05:43.711 --> 05:45.677
I say I'm marrying larry.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.846
But why?
He loves me.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.114
Not as much as I do.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.449
He has his own house.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.583
I...

05:51.585 --> 05:53.352
Love you.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.120
I'm sorry, alan.

05:55.122 --> 05:58.256
You-you really think larry can
make you happier than I can?

05:58.258 --> 06:00.659
I think I made
the right decision.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.427
You made your bed.

06:02.429 --> 06:03.995
Now let's have sex in it.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.664
Alan.

06:06.799 --> 06:08.700
Good-bye.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.440
All right.

06:15.442 --> 06:18.677
Universe: 82,224.

06:25.184 --> 06:27.285
Twenty-five.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.123
(sighs)

06:39.699 --> 06:41.566
Alan.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.001
Hi, judith.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.236
What are you doing here?

06:44.238 --> 06:45.771
Oh, god, what did jake do?

06:45.773 --> 06:48.540
Please tell me the army didn't
let him drive a tank again.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.342
No, no, nothing's
wrong with jake.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.477
Well, nothing <i>new</i> wrong.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.379
Then what's going on?
Is everything okay?

06:54.381 --> 06:57.048
Uh, it's just that I've been
having a really rough day,

06:57.050 --> 06:59.084
And I needed to see
a friendly face.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.219
And you picked <i>me?</i>

07:01.221 --> 07:03.922
There's that friendly face.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.357
I'm sorry.
Why don't you come on in.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.625
I just opened a bottle of wine.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.360
Thanks.
Wait.

07:08.362 --> 07:09.795
You don't need money, do you?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.530
No, not at all.
Okay, good.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.765
Wait, are you offering?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.807
(chuckles):
Whoa, nice blanket.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.943
What's with the cat lady
starter kit?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.044
It's my bad-news blanket.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.313
My mom gave it to me
when I was a kid.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.681
I know what
you're saying.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.383
I have a bad-news bong.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.586
And a good-news bong.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.389
And a watching-the-news bong.

07:37.391 --> 07:40.692
I guess what I'm saying is,
I like to get high.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.862
This about brooke?
She blew me off again.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.564
She was supposed
to come over after work,

07:45.566 --> 07:47.265
But she said she was tired.

07:48.301 --> 07:52.137
Not having sex with me
must be exhausting.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.972
Look... Jenny,

07:53.974 --> 07:55.807
In any relationship,

07:55.809 --> 07:57.275
It's normal for there to be

07:57.277 --> 07:59.344
A lull in the bedroom
after a while.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.612
Does the sex come back?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.814
(laughs)
you're cute.

08:04.016 --> 08:07.085
But it does help
if you do romantic stuff.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.186
Like what?

08:08.188 --> 08:09.788
Surprise her.
Be spontaneous.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.756
Let her know
that you appreciate her.

08:11.758 --> 08:14.159
I guess I could send flowers
to her work.

08:14.161 --> 08:17.128
Ugh! That's so gay.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.098
Well, these are the kinds
of things we have to do

08:20.100 --> 08:22.300
As a relationship evolves.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.301
See,

08:23.303 --> 08:25.670
Sex becomes companionship,

08:25.672 --> 08:28.440
And companionship
becomes commitment.

08:29.709 --> 08:33.011
Commitment...
Becomes complacency, which...

08:33.013 --> 08:35.080
Gives way to contempt.

08:36.649 --> 08:40.819
Until you find yourself longing
for the sweet release of death.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.487
Yikes.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.489
I'm gonna go get
my bad-news bong.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.558
(clears throat softly)

08:48.227 --> 08:50.896
Oh, my god, oh, my god.
Uh, you remember, uh,

08:50.898 --> 08:53.398
Jake's seventh grade
science project?

08:53.400 --> 08:55.667
Wait, which seventh grade?
Second time.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.002
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.937
Um, he wanted to study

08:58.939 --> 09:01.239
How different foods
would make his farts smell.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.842
Oh, yeah! He'd rip one
in tupperware,

09:03.844 --> 09:05.844
Seal it and label it.
Mm.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.380
To this day, I still remember

09:08.382 --> 09:10.815
Brussels sprouts. Yes.
Oh, brussels sprouts. Ugh...!

09:10.817 --> 09:12.918
Most parents <i>make</i>
<i>their kids eat vegetables.</i>

09:12.920 --> 09:15.220
We made ours <i>stop.</i> Yeah.
Right.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.821
And then he got rickets.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.823
(both cackling)

09:18.825 --> 09:22.427
Oh... Oh, it's been
a crazy ride, hasn't it?

09:22.429 --> 09:24.029
Yeah.
Mm.

09:25.464 --> 09:27.666
Hey... Can I
ask you something?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.234
Oh, here we go.
How much?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.536
No, no, not that.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.538
What's wrong with me?

09:33.540 --> 09:36.474
Oh, alan. I don't carry around
a list of your faults.

09:36.476 --> 09:39.210
My therapist said
it's no longer healthy.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.580
I'm-I'm serious.
I mean, it seems like

09:41.582 --> 09:44.616
Every relationship
I've ever been in
I've screwed up.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.718
Oh. Look, a marriage
doesn't fail

09:46.720 --> 09:48.653
Because of <i>one</i>
<i>person screwing up.</i>

09:48.655 --> 09:51.089
I screwed up <i>two</i> marriages.
Oh, yeah,

09:51.091 --> 09:53.825
Yeah, you're right--
you're a two-time loser.

09:53.827 --> 09:57.195
Uh, but at least I have walden;
I mean, you've got nobody.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.763
Oh, we're being
honest now?

09:59.732 --> 10:02.067
Herb's penis is
bigger than yours.

10:02.069 --> 10:05.704
(chuckles)
I'd forgotten how good
you are at this.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.539
Ha-ha...

10:07.541 --> 10:09.574
I have missed you.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.443
I mean, you know,
not the constant verbal abuse

10:11.445 --> 10:13.311
That left me
a crippled shell of a man.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.413
But we could always
make each other laugh.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.215
Oh. You could never
find my g-spot,

10:17.217 --> 10:19.250
But you could always
find my funny bone.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.785
(laughing):
Aw...
Oh...

10:20.787 --> 10:22.554
I'm just kidding.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.623
I've missed you, too.
Mm-hmm.

10:28.894 --> 10:30.395
Mmm...

10:30.397 --> 10:32.464
Oh, yeah, this is, uh...

10:32.466 --> 10:34.633
This is probably a bad idea.

10:34.635 --> 10:35.934
Definitely.
Yeah, yeah.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.105
(sniffles)

10:40.107 --> 10:41.606
(sighs)

10:41.608 --> 10:42.874
Oh.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.943
(both moaning)

10:47.146 --> 10:49.214
Let's look for that g-spot.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.516
Or... How about
you look for mine?

10:51.518 --> 10:53.585
Mmm. Mmm.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.531
Oh, god.

11:06.533 --> 11:09.501
What did we do?

11:09.503 --> 11:11.569
Mmm.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.507
Oh, god, what did <i>I</i> do?

11:15.509 --> 11:17.909
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

11:20.613 --> 11:22.881
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

11:30.456 --> 11:31.656
(grunts quietly)

11:31.658 --> 11:33.291
Come on.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.964
(sighs)
god.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.100
(whispering):
What did we do last night?

11:48.607 --> 11:51.209
More!

11:51.211 --> 11:53.278
Oh, god.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.822
(sighs)

12:08.294 --> 12:10.328
Oh. Oh.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.172
(mutters)

12:29.782 --> 12:32.150
(panting)

12:33.252 --> 12:34.919
(ringtone plays)

12:34.921 --> 12:39.557
Well, well, well, someone never
made it home last night.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.427
Am I speaking
with an engaged man?

12:42.429 --> 12:45.396
I think you might be.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.765
(laughs)
that's great.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.399
Hey, what'd lyndsey say
when you showed her the ring?

12:48.401 --> 12:50.068
That thing is huge.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.336
That's what she said.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.338
That's what I said!

12:53.340 --> 12:56.741
She also said
she's staying with larry.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.143
What? I thought
you said you were engaged.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.678
I am. To judith.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.715
What, your ex-wife?

13:03.717 --> 13:05.850
Whoa. What the hell happened?

13:11.957 --> 13:13.591
Well, it's all kind of sketchy.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.160
We had a lot to drink.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.195
Well, I-I've had
a lot to drink before,

13:17.197 --> 13:19.430
But I've never got engaged
to my ex-wife.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.799
Okay, maybe I'm being selfish,

13:20.801 --> 13:22.934
But I'd like
to talk about me right now.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.236
Jyndsey?
Hmm?

13:25.238 --> 13:27.272
Ludith.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.307
Will you larry me?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.710
Let me ask you something.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.813
Um, do you think
judith would be more upset,

13:34.815 --> 13:37.215
Uh, to wake up
and find she's engaged to me,

13:37.217 --> 13:39.884
Or to wake up
and find she's missing a finger?

13:39.886 --> 13:42.787
Okay, look, I'm sure
that she got tipsy

13:42.789 --> 13:44.689
And caught up
in the moment, too,

13:44.691 --> 13:46.524
And if you're just
honest with her,

13:46.526 --> 13:48.026
She'll probably be relieved.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.294
What if she isn't?

13:49.296 --> 13:51.329
I mean, how do I get her
to want out of marrying me?

13:51.331 --> 13:52.630
Be yourself?

13:52.632 --> 13:54.632
Worked before.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.569
(sighs)

14:00.372 --> 14:03.308
Hey, you.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.276
Um, uh, listen, uh, we should...

14:05.278 --> 14:07.045
We should really talk
about last night.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.414
Absolutely, but I need
to say something first.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.883
Things are going
to be different this time.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.219
I'm not going to make
the same mistakes I made before.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.854
And I'm going to start
by showing you

14:15.856 --> 14:18.656
How much I appreciate you
every single day.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.759
Oh, that's really sweet, but
we really should talk about...

14:21.761 --> 14:25.563
♪ who we should invite
to the wedding! ♪

14:28.868 --> 14:31.135
Hey.
Hi.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.904
Guess what.
I'm taking your advice,

14:32.906 --> 14:36.107
And I'm surprising brooke
with a romantic evening.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.910
Good. You know, I know
that's not easy for you.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.511
Your dad was the same way.

14:40.513 --> 14:44.148
His idea of romance
was a warm washcloth,

14:44.150 --> 14:47.585
Cab fare
and a bottle of penicillin.

14:47.587 --> 14:51.890
Aw! So my dad wasn't just
a drunken, diseased man-whore.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.626
He was a gentleman.

14:54.628 --> 14:59.430
Charlie would be so happy
to see his little girl now.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.432
Of course,
he'd be even more happy

15:01.434 --> 15:03.868
To see the rack
on his little girl's girlfriend.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.570
Does she have nice boobs?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.373
I've never noticed.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.841
Hey.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.376
Oh, hey.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.945
How'd it go with judith?
She take it okay?

15:13.947 --> 15:16.080
Uh, well, uh, you know,
she... Uh, she...

15:16.082 --> 15:18.683
It was a... A little hard
for her to swallow.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.184
Um...

15:20.186 --> 15:22.420
Well, I'm just glad
you talked to her.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.055
Can I get my ring back?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.323
Uh, funny story.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.825
Um... She kind of kept it,

15:27.827 --> 15:29.494
And we're kind of
getting married.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.264
Alan, I thought
you were gonna talk to her.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.532
Uh, I did.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.734
Uh, we came to an...
Oral agreement.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.137
Oh!

15:39.139 --> 15:40.271
Alan!

15:40.273 --> 15:41.439
It's my weakness.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.740
That and red velvet anything.

15:42.742 --> 15:43.975
Wait. Wait.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.576
This is the same woman

15:45.578 --> 15:47.712
That you said was so evil

15:47.714 --> 15:50.915
That her image didn't show up
in your wedding pictures.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.784
I only said that because,
at the time,

15:52.786 --> 15:55.186
I thought she was
the worst person I'd ever met,

15:55.188 --> 15:57.255
And she made my life
a living hell.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.456
But, you know, people change.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.991
It's gonna be great.

16:02.328 --> 16:06.497
So, zippy's moving out,
and he's going to be miserable.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.333
So you <i>have</i>
<i>been listening.</i>

16:08.335 --> 16:10.401
Oh.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.338
Oh, say,

16:13.340 --> 16:14.505
Dinner was great, judith.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.873
Thank you for inviting me over.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.942
Of course. You're
alan's best friend.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.744
Actually, you're
alan's <i>only</i> friend.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.479
(laughter)

16:21.481 --> 16:22.914
It's funny 'cause it's true.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.649
(laughter)

16:24.651 --> 16:26.351
Oh, honey, uh, could you pass
the potatoes, please?

16:26.353 --> 16:29.320
Oh, I think you've already
had plenty, doughboy. Mm.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.922
(high-pitched):
Ah-ha.

16:30.924 --> 16:32.056
(laughs)

16:32.058 --> 16:34.292
Well, I have to say,

16:34.294 --> 16:37.528
I was shocked when alan told me
you were getting married again.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.130
Oh, you were shocked?

16:39.132 --> 16:41.032
There was a time
when just the thought

16:41.034 --> 16:43.101
Of being touched by his tiny,
clammy hands again

16:43.103 --> 16:45.103
Made me throw up
in my mouth a little.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.337
(laughs)

16:46.339 --> 16:47.605
That's all ancient history.

16:47.607 --> 16:51.209
Yeah, if ancient history
was last Thursday.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.144
(judith and alan laugh)

16:53.146 --> 16:54.278
(both making kissing sound)

16:54.280 --> 16:56.781
Oh, isn't she great?

16:56.783 --> 16:58.182
No!

16:59.151 --> 17:00.318
She's treating you like crap.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.186
The only people
that get to do that

17:02.188 --> 17:04.088
Are people
that do it out of love,

17:04.090 --> 17:06.124
Like me and berta and your mom.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.759
Okay, fine. Me and berta.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.461
Okay. Me.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.696
It's harmless.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.331
It's just judith being funny.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.801
Did... Did you just twitch?

17:16.803 --> 17:20.204
No, I was just talking
about how funny judith is.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.739
Okay, look me in the eye

17:21.741 --> 17:24.175
And tell me how much you love
judith without twitching.

17:24.177 --> 17:26.244
Fine. I love judith.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.013
There, I said it.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.281
Alan.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.051
You cannot marry this woman.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.419
You deserve better.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.354
I mean, not much better,
but better.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.555
You know who I deserve?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.424
I deserve lyndsey,
but I can't have her.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.926
She's marrying somebody else,
so I'm taking what I can get.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.761
That's what I do.
I'm a love scavenger.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.864
You're also a house scavenger
and a money scavenger

17:46.866 --> 17:48.599
And an underwear scavenger.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.568
But that doesn't mean
you have to settle.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.136
Yes, it does.
I don't want to die alone.

17:52.138 --> 17:54.205
Maybe you don't realize it,
but there aren't a lot of people

17:54.207 --> 17:56.174
Who want to spend the rest
of their lives with me.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.443
Oh, no, I realize it!

18:02.314 --> 18:04.415
Brooke, really, we can get
a hotel for the night.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.716
No, no, no, dad.
It's fine.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.819
I'll sleep on the couch,
and you guys stay in my room.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.622
Surprise!

18:11.624 --> 18:13.724
Who's this?

18:13.726 --> 18:16.627
Uh, mom, dad,
this is, um...

18:16.629 --> 18:18.362
My girlfriend, jenny.

18:18.364 --> 18:21.199
It's a pleasure to meet you!

18:21.201 --> 18:23.501
I like her.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.740
Oh, hey, I was thinking,
now that jake's gone...

18:29.742 --> 18:32.643
Mm?
...I can turn his room
into my man-cave. You know, a

18:32.645 --> 18:35.947
Pinball machine, flat-screen
tv, potter's wheel.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.648
No, that's not going to happen.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.683
Oh, you have
plans for it?

18:38.685 --> 18:39.851
No, I'm just not

18:39.853 --> 18:41.419
Letting you get
another potter's wheel.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.388
(laughs)

18:44.390 --> 18:45.857
Judith, I have to say,

18:45.859 --> 18:47.558
I cannot take my eyes off
of that ring.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.494
I know. When I first saw it,

18:49.496 --> 18:50.928
I thought it was as fake
as the orgasms

18:50.930 --> 18:52.230
I used to have
when we were married.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.431
(laughs)

18:53.433 --> 18:54.699
That's true.

18:54.701 --> 18:55.867
Very unsatisfactory lover.

18:55.869 --> 18:57.368
(judith laughs)

18:57.370 --> 18:58.970
Judith:
But I mean,

18:58.972 --> 19:00.972
What woman could say no to this?

19:00.974 --> 19:02.273
I can think of one.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.409
Can you think of one, alan?

19:07.079 --> 19:09.080
Uh, what's going on?

19:09.082 --> 19:10.548
Oh, nothing. I'm just glad

19:10.550 --> 19:12.717
That you were there
to pick up the pieces

19:12.719 --> 19:14.285
After lyndsey turned down
alan's proposal.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.754
What?! You proposed
to her before me?

19:16.756 --> 19:18.222
Uh, well, technically,
uh, what I...

19:18.224 --> 19:19.690
Oh, you didn't know?

19:21.393 --> 19:23.861
This is awkward.

19:23.863 --> 19:28.166
Open mouth, remove pie,
insert foot.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.168
So, I'm your second choice?!

19:30.170 --> 19:32.236
No, d-doesn't matter
who was second.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.672
Uh, y-you were the
first to say yes!

19:35.674 --> 19:37.175
I will be the first

19:37.177 --> 19:39.844
To say yes
to seconds of this pie.

19:39.846 --> 19:40.912
You are unbelievable!

19:40.914 --> 19:42.079
No, the important thing is

19:42.081 --> 19:43.481
That we found
each other again.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.016
And you're willing
to settle for me,

19:45.018 --> 19:46.651
And I'm willing
to settle for you.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.818
Settle for this.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.887
Oh! God!

19:53.025 --> 19:55.459
I'm a good friend.

Hey. How's it going?

20:03.436 --> 20:05.570
Good. Thanks again
for the potter's wheel.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.038
It's the least I could do.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.372
I cost you a wife.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.440
I'm just glad

20:09.442 --> 20:10.741
You, uh, came to your senses.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.076
Yeah, I was just scared.

20:12.078 --> 20:14.212
Didn't want to spend the rest
of my life alone.

20:14.214 --> 20:17.615
Hey, as long as I'm around,
you'll never be alone.

Oh, here. Let me help
you out with that.

Thank god, it was just a dream.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.816
Are you okay, baby?
Did you have a nightmare?
