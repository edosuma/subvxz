WEBVTT

00:08.176 --> 00:10.111
WOMAN (over phone):
Where are you now?

00:10.144 --> 00:12.613
Where am I?
Where are you, ma'am?

00:12.646 --> 00:15.283
Uh, I'm right here.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.485
I see plenty of Uber cars
on my app,

00:17.518 --> 00:19.420
but none of them are near me.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.155
(woman speaks indistinctly)

00:21.189 --> 00:24.192
Uh, hang on. I might
have gotten turned around.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.429
Oh, wait. There you are.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.231
(beep)

00:30.264 --> 00:32.500
Why are you
in the alley?

00:32.533 --> 00:34.702
It took a while,
but I found you.

00:37.505 --> 00:38.639
What the hell are you doing?

00:41.409 --> 00:42.810
Look, I didn't see anything.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.478
I swear I won't tell anybody.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.447
That's right. You won't.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.317
Look, look,
no, no, no, please.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.452
(engine starts)
Hey, wait! Wait! Wait!

00:51.485 --> 00:53.454
(gunshots)

00:54.522 --> 00:56.257
*

01:26.854 --> 01:28.656
(elevator bell dings)

01:28.689 --> 01:31.659
Hey, McGee. Look who I found
in the elevator.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.761
Well, I've been riding it
all morning.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.329
I'm glad someone
finally noticed.

01:35.363 --> 01:36.797
Francis! How are you?
Good to see you.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.766
It's good to be seen, McGee.
And congrats, huh?

01:38.799 --> 01:40.768
I heard you popped
the big question.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.504
When's the big day.
Well, we don't have
a firm date yet,

01:43.537 --> 01:45.606
but, uh, we plan on saving money

01:45.639 --> 01:46.907
on the invitations
just by telling Bishop,

01:46.940 --> 01:48.609
and everyone'll show.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.379
Okay, I am sorry, Tim.
I'm just excited for you.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.646
And it's nothing
to keep secret.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.615
Heck, when I finally find
the girl of my dreams,

01:54.648 --> 01:56.284
I'll be singing it
from the mountaintops.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.552
That's very sweet.
Adorable.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.322
Special Agent Torres,
this is

02:01.355 --> 02:02.723
Special Agent Francis.
Hey.

02:02.756 --> 02:03.724
Nice to meet you.

02:03.757 --> 02:04.592
And, uh, that is

02:04.625 --> 02:05.726
Special Agent Quinn there.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.261
BISHOP: Yeah,
you might remember her

02:07.295 --> 02:08.629
as a training officer
at FLETC.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.398
Huh. You bet I do.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.732
How you been, Alex?

02:11.765 --> 02:13.834
Good! Yeah.
Special Agent Francis,

02:13.867 --> 02:15.869
what a surprise.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.671
Yeah, well, you look amazing.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.840
Oh.
Long time.

02:19.873 --> 02:20.974
Yeah. It's been, like,
four years, right?

02:21.008 --> 02:25.279
Last time I saw you, you were,
uh, reassigned to Yuma.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.847
FRANCIS (chuckles): Well, you
should recall. You're the one

02:26.880 --> 02:28.182
who had me assigned.
Oh.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.850
(laughs): No.
Yeah, I've been

02:29.883 --> 02:31.719
trying to call you the
last couple of years.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.854
Uh, is there any chance that
maybe you changed your number?

02:33.887 --> 02:34.822
Uh...

02:34.855 --> 02:36.490
uh, yes.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.558
I changed my number.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.193
Security.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.528
Mm. Well, I figured.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.962
But hey, while I'm in town,

02:41.995 --> 02:43.564
maybe we can grab a bite.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.666
Oh, yeah, that-that's great.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.701
Yeah, uh, I... yes.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.203
Um... I'm busy

02:49.237 --> 02:50.538
'cause of the job, but...

02:50.571 --> 02:53.341
if I'm free I'll call you.
Great.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.675
Here is my number.
Mm-hmm.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.577
And I'll look
forward to it.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.612
Okay. Me, too.

02:59.713 --> 03:00.881
Have a good day,
fellow agents.

03:00.914 --> 03:01.582
You bet.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.616
See ya.
Yep.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.318
Mm-hmm.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.624
Hmm?

03:10.658 --> 03:11.759
What?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.661
What do you mean, what? That.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.996
Yeah. Did you two
have a... thing?

03:16.029 --> 03:19.267
No, we did not have
a thing, exactly.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.435
At least I didn't think so.
Well, he thought

03:21.469 --> 03:22.903
you definitely had a thing.
Well, you know,

03:22.936 --> 03:24.905
whatever it was, McGee,
it was brief and it was

03:24.938 --> 03:26.574
ill-advised--
now I can't seem to shake him.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.575
Guy can't take a hint.

03:27.608 --> 03:28.742
Poor guy.
No, you know what?

03:28.776 --> 03:30.444
Bishop, not poor guy.

03:30.478 --> 03:31.845
He's actually a great guy.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.913
You know,
he's ten all around.

03:32.946 --> 03:35.349
If you're interested...

03:35.383 --> 03:37.251
Just have to be ready
to settle down.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.853
Me? No. No, no, no.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.590
I am not looking...
to settle anywhere.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.658
In fact, I'm-I'm
not looking at all.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.560
Mm-hmm. Yeah, right.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.861
Excuse me?

03:48.896 --> 03:51.432
All women are looking.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.666
BISHOP:
Oh, ha!

03:52.700 --> 03:54.668
Is that right?
Yeah, to settle down. Always.

03:54.702 --> 03:55.603
All women?
Yeah, you...

03:55.636 --> 03:56.870
you pretend to play it cool,

03:56.904 --> 03:59.607
like, like you're not looking,
but then when you see something

03:59.640 --> 04:02.376
you like, you go, "Oh, my God,
I'm not really looking! Oh!"

04:02.410 --> 04:03.677
But then you overdo

04:03.711 --> 04:05.613
the ceremony and you
make it, like, a thing

04:05.646 --> 04:07.681
and a meal out of it, and then,
you know, eventually...

04:07.715 --> 04:08.749
Right? Come on.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.718
McGee, back me up here.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.852
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

04:11.885 --> 04:13.354
Uh, wow.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.755
Really? Like that?
That-that's how

04:14.788 --> 04:16.023
you're gonna do me?
Yeah.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.692
That's what we do
to each other now?

04:18.726 --> 04:19.627
Okay, maybe...

04:19.660 --> 04:20.928
maybe not all women.
Mm-hmm.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.730
Uh, w... because what I'm...

04:22.763 --> 04:24.732
see, what I'm trying to say...

04:24.765 --> 04:25.933
What are you
saying, exactly?

04:25.966 --> 04:27.568
Don't say anything, Torres.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.036
You can thank me later.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.372
Okay, that got weird in a hurry.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.573
And it was only getting weirder.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.775
McGee, watch the home fort.
Everybody else, with me. MTAC.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.644
Now.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.048
Clayton, hey.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.584
How are you, Ellie?
I'm good.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.853
Uh, Special Agents
Quinn and Torres,

04:45.886 --> 04:48.656
this is MI6 Intel Officer
Clayton Reeves.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.724
MI6. That's fancy.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.660
How's life across
the pond?

04:52.693 --> 04:54.628
I wouldn't know. I'm calling
from your side of it.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.964
Philadelphia.
GIBBS:
Why are you there, Reeves?

04:56.997 --> 04:58.699
Searching for a mate
of mine, Gibbs.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.768
MI6 Officer Mason Finley.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.871
Came from London last week
chasing intel on a smuggling op

05:03.904 --> 05:05.706
and hasn't
been heard from since.

05:05.739 --> 05:06.840
And why are you
calling us?

05:06.874 --> 05:08.742
Finley's last GPS signal came

05:08.776 --> 05:10.811
from this alleyway, where
it seems that I find myself

05:10.844 --> 05:14.515
in NCIS jurisdiction-- have to
imagine there's some connection.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.649
I haven't touched him.
Mm. I.D.?

05:15.683 --> 05:17.117
You're my first call.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.387
Well, technically,
the Northeast Office

05:19.420 --> 05:21.389
would have jurisdiction.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.857
And I will call them--
but frankly, if there's

05:23.891 --> 05:25.659
any connection to Finley's
disappearance, I prefer to use

05:25.693 --> 05:27.528
your agents, Gibbs.
Have the local office

05:27.561 --> 05:29.830
send the body here-- we'll
send a team up to you.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.599
I'm in. I've never
been to Philly.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.766
Yeah. Me, neither, Gibbs.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.834
I'm always down
for a road trip.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.836
Bishop, yes.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.070
Torres, no.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.839
What? Why not?

05:38.872 --> 05:41.675
We need you here.

05:41.709 --> 05:42.175
Quinn.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.011
You go with Bishop.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.447
Um...

05:46.480 --> 05:48.416
I'm sorry?

05:48.449 --> 05:49.850
What? I stutter?

05:49.883 --> 05:51.151
Uh...

05:51.184 --> 05:52.853
Are you messing
with me?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.888
You know your way around
Philadelphia and they don't.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.425
Experience counts.
Even if my experience

05:57.458 --> 05:59.059
is exactly why
I shouldn't go?

05:59.092 --> 06:00.861
Shouldn't, Quinn?
Or you won't?
Gibbs, you know

06:00.894 --> 06:02.730
I would never defy
a direct order from you.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.165
Okay. Then this
is a direct order.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.735
So... so you are messing
with me, then?

06:07.768 --> 06:09.169
Come again?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.138
Did I stutter?
I don't have time to mess

06:11.171 --> 06:13.541
with anyone
or talk you into this, Quinn.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.942
You want back
in this game,

06:14.975 --> 06:17.044
then you go where I say you go.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.714
It matters that much to you?
Well, yeah,

06:20.748 --> 06:22.816
now that you're forcing me
into this conversation with you,

06:22.850 --> 06:24.752
yeah, it does--
it matters that much to me.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.421
Okay.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.024
Fine, I'll go.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.826
The sailor, Quinn.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.028
You find out what
happened to that kid.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.812
*
(bell tolling)

06:52.846 --> 06:55.115
(passing horns honking)

06:56.517 --> 06:58.619
Oh. MI6 is staying here?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.053
Us, too, I'm afraid.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.756
Ugh.
Just wish it was closer
to the Italian market.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.893
Oh, yeah, the Italian market,
the Roc theme in the car,

07:05.926 --> 07:07.961
and a run up
the museum steps later.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.997
So, this issue you
have with Philly...

07:10.030 --> 07:11.899
I don't have
an issue with Philly.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.901
It's a New York thing,
right? Sports rivalries?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.969
(groans)
Mets-Phillies,
Giants-Eagles...

07:16.003 --> 07:17.671
Let's go with that.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.707
I mean, government agencies
putting their employees here?

07:19.740 --> 07:20.908
Really?
REEVES:
You can blame

07:20.941 --> 07:22.242
budget cuts for that.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.144
Damn Brexit's
got us all in a panic.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.979
Hey!
You got here fast, Ellie!

07:26.013 --> 07:28.148
Yeah, she has a bit
of a lead foot.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.984
Agent Quinn, thanks for coming.
You process the Navy kid yet?

07:31.018 --> 07:33.554
Already shipped him off
to Dr. Ducky for autopsy.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.756
And still no sign
of your friend?
Not yet.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.190
You ladies come and check in.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.992
I'll show you his room.

07:39.026 --> 07:39.927
I already scanned

07:39.960 --> 07:41.128
for prints and evidence--

07:41.161 --> 07:42.830
no sign of foul play.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.898
I texted you both
Finley's info.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.067
Front desk last sighting

07:47.100 --> 07:49.870
was two days ago.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.505
He traveled light.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.841
You know these assignments.
Got to be ready to move fast.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.876
An assignment
for smuggled weapons?
With all

07:55.909 --> 07:57.678
the national uncertainty,
means new opportunities

07:57.711 --> 07:59.046
on the black market.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.148
The black market what?
Well, in this case,

08:01.181 --> 08:03.083
Russian rocket launchers,
smuggled into the U.S.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.652
by way of the U.K.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.853
And who are the smugglers?

08:05.886 --> 08:06.987
That's Finley came
to figure out

08:07.020 --> 08:09.022
(phone rings)
before he disappeared.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.658
Hey, Gibbs.
We just got here.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.259
And your victim just got here.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.829
We I.D.'d him as Petty Officer
Third Class Gary Falco.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.965
21 years old, from
Upper Darby, Pennsylvania.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.967
Currently on leave
from Naval Station Newport

08:20.000 --> 08:21.669
in Rhode Island.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.270
GIBBS: We'll contact his C.O.
from here.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.873
You pay a visit to his family.
In Upper Darby.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.175
McGEE: It's a suburb about
20 miles outside of Philly.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.810
Yeah, I know it.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.011
(quietly):
Of all places.

08:32.713 --> 08:33.814
What's that?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.148
Nothing. Just send the address.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.184
GIBBS:
Check in with us after.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.890
"Of all places"?

08:42.923 --> 08:44.958
What?
Quinn wasn't happy going, Gibbs.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.860
No happier than I am stuck here.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.129
And we're here to
make you happy?

08:49.162 --> 08:50.898
What the hell is wrong
with everyone today?

08:50.931 --> 08:52.566
(laughing)

08:52.600 --> 08:54.301
Are you feeling stuck?

08:56.737 --> 08:58.739
Get unstuck!

09:01.642 --> 09:02.976
You got something to add?

09:03.010 --> 09:05.212
No, that about covers it.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.219
DUCKY:
Ah, the City of Brotherly Love.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.788
Also the city of firsts.

09:14.822 --> 09:17.925
Home to the nation's
first daily newspaper.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.060
Its first hospital.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.730
Oh, yeah,
and its first medical school.

09:22.763 --> 09:26.366
In fact, to this day,
one out of six American doctors

09:26.399 --> 09:30.070
receives some level of training
in Philadelphia.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.206
As I am not one of that six,
dear boy,

09:33.240 --> 09:35.776
I trust you will not hold it
against me.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.144
What do you think, Duck?

09:37.177 --> 09:40.213
It's more what I'm smelling,
Jethro. Beer.

09:40.247 --> 09:44.317
Of the... hoppy
microbrew variety.

09:44.351 --> 09:48.121
Nothing unusual for
a young sailor home on leave.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.123
Gunshots?
I see

09:50.157 --> 09:52.059
two to the chest.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.094
Point-blank range.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.830
(sighs): The wounds
should provide more answers.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.298
(smacks lips)

09:58.331 --> 10:01.101
You okay?
(chuckles)

10:01.134 --> 10:04.271
You still ask me that question
after all these years, Jethro,

10:04.304 --> 10:06.273
but the answer is still no.

10:06.306 --> 10:10.110
Not while I have
a young person on my table.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.812
Never okay.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.981
Got it.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.382
But, Jethro.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.819
Thanks for asking.

10:24.191 --> 10:28.095
(birds chirping)
WOMAN: No way was my Gary
into anything bad.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.664
Not him.
So no enemies,

10:30.698 --> 10:32.666
old grudges...?
Nothing.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.869
Ask his old high school friends.
They were all good kids.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.739
They were with him...
just before.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.140
What time was he with them?

10:40.173 --> 10:44.344
Uh, he left on the 6:15 train
to the city.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.114
Supper,
some bar-hopping.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.684
He wore his Navy blues.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.887
He loved showing them off.

10:53.921 --> 10:56.790
Do you know how
long he stayed?

10:56.824 --> 10:59.026
I called him
just after midnight.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.394
The last train is at 1:00.
But he said

11:01.428 --> 11:04.832
that he had some app on his
phone that could get him a ride.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.099
I don't know.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.467
We'll need his friends' names

11:07.500 --> 11:09.937
and his cell number so we
can trace the account.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.975
(voice breaks):
I should have picked him up.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.445
You know...

11:18.478 --> 11:21.448
your kid joins
the military, and...

11:21.481 --> 11:24.184
you just hold your breath.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.255
Until they come home
for a visit...

11:28.288 --> 11:31.959
and you can finally exhale.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.997
Or at least you think you can.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.200
(sniffles)

11:44.905 --> 11:47.440
These numbers will help us
a lot, Mrs. Falco. Thank you.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.476
If there's anything
else you need,

11:49.509 --> 11:52.245
or anything else
I can do...
Actually, um,

11:52.279 --> 11:53.981
do you know the Shaw family?

11:54.014 --> 11:56.216
They used to live
over on Claremont?

11:56.249 --> 11:58.051
I don't know any Shaws.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.120
But Claremont's just a few
blocks that way-- I can go

12:00.153 --> 12:01.254
get the phone book
and...
No.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.790
No, I'm sorry.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.758
Um, no, if there's
anything you need,

12:04.792 --> 12:07.227
you let us know, okay?
You have our numbers?

12:07.260 --> 12:10.230
I do. And there is.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.200
Go get those animals
who killed my boy.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.304
We will.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.809
(clears throat softly)

12:21.842 --> 12:24.077
(door opens)

12:25.178 --> 12:27.280
So, who's the
Shaw family?

12:27.314 --> 12:28.882
Nobody.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.451
You want to drive
by Claremont anyway?
Nope.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.121
McGee.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.356
Yeah, I have names
and numbers for you.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.159
Uh, Rick Provenzoli.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.528
(whirrs, beeps)

12:41.561 --> 12:43.263
Print.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.265
Print.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.299
(beep)

12:46.333 --> 12:47.835
Come on. Print.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.270
Print. What the hell is
wrong with this thing?

12:50.303 --> 12:52.139
Torres, nothing's
wrong with it.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.308
Paper jams and dried-up ink
cartridges are a way of life.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.011
Well... this
thing hates me.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.546
Nah, it doesn't hate you.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.882
Office equipment is your friend.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.283
It's a bad friend--
the one you lend money to,

13:03.316 --> 13:04.918
and never pays you back.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.519
Ah.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.922
Hey, let me use
your printer, man.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.358
Oh. Uh, no, no.
See, that-that's my printer.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.360
I'm the only one that uses that.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.363
Uh, we talked about this.
It's very sensitive.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.398
All the settings are actually
very specific to my needs.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.233
I am the only one that knows

13:20.267 --> 13:22.235
its little nuances, okay?
So, you're fine with this one,

13:22.269 --> 13:24.237
you're good to go--
just to be kind to it,

13:24.271 --> 13:25.505
and it'll be kind to you.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.174
Kind for what?

13:27.207 --> 13:29.042
GIBBS:
Sitrep.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.278
McGEE:
Oh. Uh,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.413
Falco's C.O.
at Naval Station Newport

13:33.446 --> 13:35.983
says that he was a
model sailor, boss.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.117
No red flags, no enemies.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.986
Anything on the Uber driver?
Yeah.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.421
We were able to track her
down through Falco's cell.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.891
She says that
he sounded lost,

13:43.924 --> 13:46.059
but then he said he spotted
her car, still he didn't show.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.560
What about the high school
friends Falco was meeting?

13:47.594 --> 13:49.329
TORRES:
Quinn and Bishop are
interviewing them now.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.097
We should know soon.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.565
What's your gut
telling you, boss?

13:52.599 --> 13:55.468
What's any of this got to do
with a missing MI6 officer?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.370
And the smuggled
weapons.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.906
Maybe.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.041
Or maybe I know a
businessman in DC

14:01.074 --> 14:03.310
who dabbles in smuggling.
Can you find him?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.312
Squeeze him?
Oh, yeah.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.247
Quite literally, if I have to.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.349
Good. McGee, go with him.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.385
Hold the leash.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.021
But not too tight, McGee.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.023
I don't really bite.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.624
Somehow I doubt that.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.626
Well, Falco's buddies
confirm the timeline.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.494
They ate, drank,
met at 7:00.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.530
Parted ways at 1:30.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.165
Okay.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.334
Mmm.
Is that one
of those cheesesteaks?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.869
Mm-hmm. They're amazing.
I got you one.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.505
(chuckles)

14:32.539 --> 14:34.574
There's two of them
in there.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.676
Oops. One's for later.
QUINN:
Not to mention

14:36.709 --> 14:38.411
the one she ate in the car.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.246
Well...

14:39.279 --> 14:41.281
(ringtone playing)

14:43.283 --> 14:45.352
Wait a minute.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.920
I don't know this number,

14:46.954 --> 14:49.122
but S-O-S-Double-0-9.

14:49.156 --> 14:50.390
That's Finley.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.092
Are you sure?
That's what
he calls me.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.493
I'm Double-0-9, he's
Double-0-nothing.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.195
It's a Bond thing.
That's an S.O.S.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.429
Is there anything else?

14:56.463 --> 14:58.031
3-6 Tompkins.
Could be
an address.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.499
I'll find the address
in the car.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.571
(man coughing)

15:04.604 --> 15:05.973
NCIS!!

15:06.006 --> 15:07.107
Finley!

15:07.140 --> 15:08.675
Oh, Clay!
Out the back!

15:08.708 --> 15:11.111
Out there! I heard them run out
there! You can't let them go...

15:11.144 --> 15:12.612
Stay with him!
I got him,
I got him, I got him.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.281
Okay, I'm gonna undo your hands.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.315
Thank God.
Okay, I got you.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.417
Thank you.

15:19.019 --> 15:22.389
(sirens wailing, chirping)

15:22.422 --> 15:24.324
(distorted, echoing):
Can I get help?!

15:24.357 --> 15:26.493
Hold on, Em. I gotcha.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.362
(sirens fading)
(Quinn pants)

15:29.396 --> 15:31.164
(running steps approaching)

15:31.198 --> 15:32.532
No sign of them.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.401
BISHOP:
Building's empty.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.203
Clay...

15:36.236 --> 15:37.337
(groaning)

15:37.370 --> 15:39.172
(panting)

15:39.206 --> 15:41.008
Quinn, you okay?
Yeah.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.476
I'm fine. I'm good.
Just, uh, take care of him.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.346
I'm fine, okay?

15:46.379 --> 15:47.647
(panting)

16:00.427 --> 16:03.130
Please, Clay, we have
to find these guys.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.597
We have to stop them.
We'll find them, Fin.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.433
Now take a deep breath,

16:06.466 --> 16:08.335
start from the beginning.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.070
(takes deep breath)

16:10.103 --> 16:11.538
I tracked the weapons
to a warehouse

16:11.571 --> 16:13.506
where these bastards were
unloading them into a car.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.042
An SUV, I think it was.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.576
I was surveilling
from across the road

16:16.609 --> 16:19.579
when all of a sudden, from
out of nowhere, this lad...

16:19.612 --> 16:21.048
runs up and jumps in.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.282
Now, I took him for
part of the gang

16:22.315 --> 16:23.516
until they drew
their weapons.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.785
He was a Navy petty officer.
Yes.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.088
And he was dead
before I could do anything.

16:28.121 --> 16:31.158
They would have killed me, too,
if I hadn't identified myself.

16:31.191 --> 16:34.727
They cut my GPS...

16:34.761 --> 16:36.229
right out of my arm,

16:36.263 --> 16:38.298
right there in the alley.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.634
And they dragged me back here
to find out what I knew.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.270
Huh.
Where'd you get
the burner phone?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.604
One of them dropped it.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.306
It took me ages to
grab ahold of it,

16:46.339 --> 16:48.075
and send that text.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.742
Praying that you'd get it.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.145
You have no idea who they are?
They wore masks.

16:52.179 --> 16:55.382
And I track the weapons, miss,
not the men.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.317
But now they
know who I am,

16:57.350 --> 17:00.053
where I live, my wife-- please,
Clay, we have to call her.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.788
we have to warn her.
We'll call her, Fin.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.023
Let's call her now.
Yes.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.362
Sure did a number
on him, huh?

17:09.396 --> 17:11.298
Yeah.

17:11.331 --> 17:14.401
I'll send these shots to Abby
and call Gibbs with an update.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.836
Yeah. Tell him I'm sending
trace evidence, too.

17:16.869 --> 17:20.707
Anything else I
should tell him?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.109
Such as?

17:22.142 --> 17:23.176
You sure you're okay?

17:23.210 --> 17:24.544
I'm fine.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.080
Call him.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.187
*

17:36.289 --> 17:38.091
Hold my gun.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.659
Your gun? Why?

17:39.692 --> 17:41.661
TORRES:
Ivan? I'm looking for Ivan.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.096
(chuckles):
Hey, man.
It's all right.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.365
I know him.
Or are you a ghost?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.134
Been so long, I was
sure you'd be dead by now.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.736
Oh, I've died
a bunch of times. Yeah.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.605
But I keep coming
back for more.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.842
Deal me in?
You come to play cards?

17:55.875 --> 17:58.578
I need information.
Smuggling action in Philly.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.647
Everything you heard
through the grapevine.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.515
(chuckles):
I have no grapevine.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.618
This club is my life now--
and completely legit.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.787
Legit?
Like your armed buddy here?
He's licensed

18:07.820 --> 18:09.622
to carry,
and a sad necessity.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.658
My previous vocation
left me with enemies.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.726
And I don't believe
we've been introduced.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.396
NCIS. Special Agent...
Feds? Are you
kidding me?

18:16.429 --> 18:17.630
That's who you bring in here?

18:17.664 --> 18:18.898
Yeah.
Get the hell
out of my club.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.133
Come back when
you have a warrant.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.168
Deal the cards.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.603
(music continues in distance)

18:25.505 --> 18:28.241
TORRES:
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

18:28.275 --> 18:31.511
Whoa, I got your attention now.
(laughs)

18:31.544 --> 18:32.879
You like this song?
I love this song.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.581
You crazy
son of a bitch.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.416
You know crazy?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.585
Talk to my friend over here.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.154
Someone in Philly

18:41.188 --> 18:43.190
is selling rocket
launchers, Ivan.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.191
Now, given your

18:44.224 --> 18:45.725
previous vocation,
might you know

18:45.758 --> 18:48.328
of any former associates that
could possibly be in the market

18:48.361 --> 18:49.629
for such an item?

18:51.598 --> 18:54.301
Well... since you asked nicely,

18:54.334 --> 18:56.703
a few possible names
come to mind.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.839
That worked out, huh?

18:59.872 --> 19:01.174
McGEE:
One name we got

19:01.208 --> 19:02.675
was Nestor Carbone.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.577
Served time
for racketeering and robbery.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.180
Paroled last year.
Yeah, we also got
two brothers,

19:07.214 --> 19:08.415
Thompson and James Daly.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.616
Career crooks.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.951
Finley, those names
ring a bell?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.953
We can forget the Daly brothers.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.256
They were my first targets,

19:16.289 --> 19:18.425
but all they smuggle now
are exotic birds.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.193
I like birds.

19:20.227 --> 19:22.262
I notified
U.S. Fish and Wildlife.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.964
Uh, what about this other name?
Um... Carbone?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.699
Nestor Carbone.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.202
Son of Tiny Joe Carbone,
the late Mob boss.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.637
Yeah, that would make sense.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.439
They never spoke English
in front of me.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.241
Do we know
where to find him?

19:34.274 --> 19:35.542
Our intel says
he owns a body shop

19:35.575 --> 19:37.310
in the East Falls area.
I'll dig up

19:37.344 --> 19:39.712
an exact address
and send it to you.
Get over there.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.180
Check it out.
REEVES: Will do, Gibbs.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.219
I'm coming with you.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.356
REEVES:
I mean...

19:49.389 --> 19:49.989
only if you think

19:50.022 --> 19:51.391
you're up for it, pal.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.359
Yeah.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.493
Uh, Quinn...

19:53.526 --> 19:56.563
Look, uh, I'm not so sure.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.465
Well, I am sure.
I'm going.

19:58.498 --> 20:02.402
You've been taped up and beaten
for the last how many days?

20:02.435 --> 20:05.338
I say you sleep
on it, Finley.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.673
I say we all

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
sleep on it.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.481
(door closes)

20:14.514 --> 20:16.583
Gibbs, I got
the results back

20:16.616 --> 20:18.918
on the bullets that
Ducky pulled.
Yeah? What'd they tell you?

20:18.951 --> 20:20.587
Definitely not a mugging.
Nine-millimeter,

20:20.620 --> 20:21.888
hollow point,
close range--

20:21.921 --> 20:23.656
we're dealing
with pros here.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.892
It's even more of a reason
for us to get out there, Gibbs.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.360
It's only a two-hour drive.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.362
Quinn and Bishop
might need our help.
Actually,

20:29.396 --> 20:31.598
it's a two-and-a-half-
hour drive in traffic.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.601
And Bishop and Quinn are
totally capable agents

20:34.634 --> 20:38.405
who aren't always looking
to "settle down," by the way.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.374
Wow.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.842
You know what, Nick,
we gave them good leads.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.444
Let them follow up on them.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.379
Not every step of this
requires a table dance.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.415
Hey, you liked that table dance?

20:48.448 --> 20:49.382
(exhales)

20:49.416 --> 20:51.784
Table dance?
It's a...

20:51.818 --> 20:54.321
figure of speech, boss.
Inside joke, sir.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.888
Find that address on Carbone.
Hey, I could, uh,

20:55.922 --> 20:57.324
deliver that personally.
No.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.825
You're staying, Torres.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.493
Don't ask me again.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.728
Finish your report.

21:03.563 --> 21:06.866
I'll finish
that damn report.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.702
If you let me use your printer.
Stay away from my printer.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.341
Come on, man!

21:16.409 --> 21:19.011
(train whistle blowing,
horns honking)

21:19.045 --> 21:21.381
Finley will be right down.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.383
He's really ready
to jump back in?

21:23.416 --> 21:25.718
I'm not sure there's
any keeping him out.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.720
Have you got the location?
Uh, yeah.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.356
McGee texted it
this morning.

21:29.389 --> 21:32.024
Buy Better Auto
on Clancy in East Bay.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.826
Do you know it, Alex?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.828
Why would I know it?
I thought you knew Philly.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.029
What, does that
make me the mayor?

21:37.063 --> 21:38.531
And by the way,
your buddy

21:38.565 --> 21:39.999
is not ready to jump back in.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.334
He needs to stay here.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.703
Will you give us
a second?

21:46.373 --> 21:48.608
Um, what are
you doing?

21:48.641 --> 21:51.744
I trained you, Bishop.
You don't pull me aside.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.481
That's the most you've
said to me all morning.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.115
Are you okay?
You need to stop

21:56.148 --> 21:58.017
asking me that.
And you need to talk to me.

21:58.050 --> 22:01.120
Look, I-I know you
didn't want to come here.
Okay, it doesn't matter

22:01.153 --> 22:05.024
what I want-- we're here;
let's make the best of it.
I would, but you're not.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.694
This isn't your best.

22:07.727 --> 22:10.597
Just... tell me what's wrong,
and maybe I can help.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.699
You can't help.
Alex...

22:12.732 --> 22:15.368
Maybe last time I was in Philly,
it didn't end so well and,

22:15.402 --> 22:17.870
and maybe it's messing with me a
little bit more than I thought.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.139
You happy?
No, but...

22:20.172 --> 22:22.375
it's a start.
No. It's not a start.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.511
It's an end.
Nothing to help.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.945
Nothing to fix.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.146
I know you're
concerned, Ellie,

22:27.179 --> 22:28.981
but it's fine.
It's complicated.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.384
Most things are.
(groans)

22:31.418 --> 22:33.486
I'm ready.
Let's get this guy.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.954
Right. Yeah.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.356
That's great.
Whatever.
(sighs)

22:38.825 --> 22:41.494
(electric tools whirring)

22:41.528 --> 22:45.465
Excuse me. Special Agents
Bishop and Quinn, NCIS.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.133
Looking for a Mr. Carbone.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.535
Nestor Carbone?

22:49.669 --> 22:50.870
Hey, NCIS! Stop!

22:50.903 --> 22:52.939
(woman screams)

22:52.972 --> 22:54.941
(man yelling)
Hold your fire!

22:54.974 --> 22:57.544
What's wrong with you!
After what that monster
did to me?

22:57.577 --> 22:59.912
We don't know if it's him!
I told you!

22:59.946 --> 23:01.914
You shot me!
You son of a bitch!

23:01.948 --> 23:04.717
You shot me!
Okay, okay, just
call an ambulance.

23:04.751 --> 23:05.852
BISHOP:
I got it, I got it.

23:05.885 --> 23:06.919
What's wrong with that guy?

23:06.953 --> 23:07.954
(groans)

23:07.987 --> 23:09.489
Yes, we need
an ambulance.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.623
Buy Better auto shop.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.668
MAN:
I never saw that guy before.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.803
MI5-6... whatever.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.138
And I sure as hell don't know
anything about any weapons.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.907
REEVES:
Then you ran for no reason.
Hey,

23:27.940 --> 23:30.142
where I come from, when people
knock on your door with badges,

23:30.176 --> 23:32.078
it's never to hand out
prize money.

23:32.111 --> 23:34.013
Or maybe you ran 'cause most
of the cars in your shop have

23:34.046 --> 23:35.715
the VIN numbers scraped off.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.985
These babies stolen, Nestor?

23:39.018 --> 23:40.186
I want to call my lawyer.

23:41.521 --> 23:45.091
FINLEY:
No excuses.
Clay, I...

23:45.124 --> 23:47.093
I snapped. Let my emotions
get the better of me.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.661
In which case, Fin,

23:48.695 --> 23:50.597
I suggest you let us
take it from here.
No.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.899
No, no.
Clay, I'll be fine.
And I'm not suggesting.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.233
Take the break you should
have taken before.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.602
BISHOP:
Here's the call
(phone ringing)

23:55.635 --> 23:56.969
I've been dreading.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.107
Hey, Gibbs.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.074
How'd it go, Bishop?

24:02.108 --> 24:04.076
Could've gone better.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.613
Carbone is not exactly
a good guy,

24:06.646 --> 24:08.515
but he's not our guy, either.

24:08.548 --> 24:11.117
Which... didn't stop Finley
from shooting him.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.152
Wait. Wait, what?

24:13.185 --> 24:14.754
In the leg. It's not serious.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.088
And Reeves relieved him of duty.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.124
Well, where is Quinn?

24:18.157 --> 24:19.959
Where's Quinn?

24:19.992 --> 24:23.062
Yeah. Special Agent Quinn,
your partner, Bishop.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.697
She... l-left.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.699
Uh, she had someplace to be.

24:26.733 --> 24:28.868
Where?

24:28.901 --> 24:30.937
She just needed... some time.

24:30.970 --> 24:31.971
Which is it,

24:32.004 --> 24:33.172
Bishop? She needed some time

24:33.205 --> 24:35.141
or she had someplace to be?

24:35.174 --> 24:37.043
She went back to the hotel.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.779
After everything went down,
she just had to get out of here.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.013
I'm on my way.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.148
Gibbs, you don't have to...

24:42.181 --> 24:43.616
(groans)

24:43.650 --> 24:45.718
...do that.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.920
(sighs heavily)
Okay.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.757
(whirring, beeping)
Come on. Come on, print.
Come on.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.092
Really? Is that
how you want to play it?

24:53.125 --> 24:55.194
Stop it! Are you crazy?

24:55.227 --> 24:57.263
What did Rhonda
ever do to you?

24:58.297 --> 24:59.566
Rhonda?

24:59.599 --> 25:01.233
It's just a machine.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.771
"Just a machine"?
(exhales)

25:04.804 --> 25:07.640
Major Mass Spec. Earmuffs.
Look,

25:07.674 --> 25:10.643
first it won't print,
and now this stupid thing

25:10.677 --> 25:13.913
just has this
ink thing pop out.
Don't call Rhonda stupid!

25:13.946 --> 25:16.115
"Stupid" is an ugly word.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.718
I wouldn't print anything
for you, either, if you
treated me that way.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.286
What happened to the printer
in the squad room?

25:20.319 --> 25:23.556
I don't know.
It kind of just...

25:23.590 --> 25:25.091
broke.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.793
Did you...

25:26.826 --> 25:28.661
kind of break it?

25:28.695 --> 25:29.996
No. (chuckles)

25:30.997 --> 25:32.064
Maybe.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.266
Mister, you have
some serious T.A.I.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.269
Technology Anger Issues.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.672
Look, I-I was gonna use
McGee's printer, but...

25:39.706 --> 25:41.107
No! Oh.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.276
No one uses McGee's printer.
(hissing inhale)

25:44.310 --> 25:46.012
Abby, I'm sorry.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.314
I don't have technology
issues-- I have...

25:48.347 --> 25:50.316
(keyboard clacking)
office issues.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.919
You know, I want to be out there
kicking down doors,

25:52.952 --> 25:54.220
you know, fighting crime.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.055
I don't kick down doors.
Are you saying that

25:56.088 --> 25:57.657
I'm not a crime fighter?
No. That's not...

25:57.690 --> 26:00.092
No. That's not what I'm saying.

26:00.126 --> 26:02.228
What I'm saying is, is that...

26:02.261 --> 26:04.831
your type of crime fighting,

26:04.864 --> 26:07.734
I'm just...
just not cut out for.
Could you just...

26:07.767 --> 26:09.301
hold your thoughts.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.237
I'm getting more
shots from Bishop.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.339
This is that auto body shop.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.207
(tapping keyboard)

26:16.643 --> 26:18.778
What are these?
Um...

26:18.811 --> 26:20.346
that is the warehouse where
Clayton's friend was tied up.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.181
The smugglers had him
in there for days.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.717
If it weren't for that burner
phone, he might be dead by now.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.018
May I ask you a
stupid question?

26:26.052 --> 26:28.220
There's that ugly word again.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.356
Where's the bathroom?

26:30.389 --> 26:31.724
The bathroom?
The bathroom's just...

26:31.758 --> 26:33.392
No, no, no. Where's
the bathroom here,

26:33.425 --> 26:34.861
in this place?

26:34.894 --> 26:36.696
I don't see a bottle
or a jug.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.865
You know, if he was really
there for a few days,

26:38.898 --> 26:42.101
then where did he go when...
you know, he had to, uh...

26:42.134 --> 26:43.602
go?

26:45.004 --> 26:48.675
That... is
a very smart question.

26:49.676 --> 26:52.679
(mellow jazz piano playing)

26:58.818 --> 27:00.820
How many is that?

27:02.454 --> 27:04.891
(sighs): Uh...

27:04.924 --> 27:07.359
(clears throat)
I'm pacing myself.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.264
Bishop called you?
Nope. I called her.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.033
She tried to cover.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.267
Cover for what?

27:15.301 --> 27:17.236
Finley should have
never been there.

27:17.269 --> 27:20.339
And you never should have left,
but I guess you needed time.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.713
I mean, it's East Falls,
and then Austin Powers

27:26.746 --> 27:28.748
starts shooting up the joint.

27:28.781 --> 27:29.982
I mean...

27:30.016 --> 27:31.751
Okay, Gibbs,

27:31.784 --> 27:34.420
you sent me here
to test me.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.823
I'm obviously failing.

27:36.856 --> 27:40.226
Oh, don't try to say
you didn't want this.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.394
Want what?

27:42.428 --> 27:46.232
When my team had an opening,
you sent subpar agents

27:46.265 --> 27:49.736
on the chance that
you'd have to come back.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.804
Are you nuts?
I sent you great agents.

27:51.838 --> 27:52.872
No.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.306
No, you sent good agents.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.143
But deep down...

27:57.176 --> 27:58.978
you wanted to confront this.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.347
I wanted to confront...

28:01.380 --> 28:03.449
back here in East Falls?

28:03.482 --> 28:05.985
Okay. You know what,
I think you're spending

28:06.018 --> 28:09.055
a little too much time
with your shrink friend.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.322
(chuckles):
Okay.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.725
All right. You know...

28:12.759 --> 28:15.728
Okay, I-I didn't say anything.
There's nothing to confront.

28:15.762 --> 28:17.764
(sighs)
I didn't say that.

28:19.365 --> 28:22.301
It's not like avoiding has
been doing me any favors.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.470
Yeah, well,
stop avoiding it, then.

28:24.503 --> 28:28.040
Have another one of those,
if that's what you need.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.877
But let's go hit this head-on.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.413
Maybe you should have one.

28:34.446 --> 28:38.084
I've... really
haven't been pacing myself.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.356
(pats Quinn's back)
Come on.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.326
Where the hell are we going?

28:47.359 --> 28:49.495
Ah, and then there was one.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.431
No Liberty Bell
for you, Timothy?

28:52.464 --> 28:54.400
Actually, Duck,
I'm in, uh, virtual Philly here

28:54.433 --> 28:57.436
trying to dig up a few more
smuggling suspects.
Mm.

28:57.469 --> 29:00.172
Well, look no
farther, McGee.

29:00.206 --> 29:03.175
Or is it "further," Ducky?
In this case,

29:03.209 --> 29:04.176
go with "further."

29:04.210 --> 29:05.978
Well, look no further, McGee.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.814
These photographs
of the warehouse prompted

29:07.847 --> 29:09.982
a very smart question
from Agent Torres.
The genius part

29:10.016 --> 29:11.851
was what Abby did
after I asked it.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.185
What'd you ask her?
Finley was supposedly

29:13.219 --> 29:14.887
tied up for days--

29:14.921 --> 29:16.422
so where's the bathroom?

29:16.455 --> 29:18.424
TORRES: Abby found the
old floor plans online.

29:18.457 --> 29:21.360
There's no working bathroom
or plumbing.
DUCKY: Wait a minute.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.996
Did you just say
"supposedly" tied up?

29:24.030 --> 29:25.497
Here's the genius part.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.466
So, I did a search
of the neighborhood.

29:27.499 --> 29:31.203
There is one public bathroom
within a three-mile radius--

29:31.237 --> 29:34.073
this coffee shop just around
the corner from the warehouse.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.474
Somehow I doubt they
were walking Finley over there

29:35.507 --> 29:37.877
every time he needed to go.
Somehow you'd be right.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.345
The shop's security cameras
caught this

29:39.378 --> 29:41.247
two days ago--
and I do believe

29:41.280 --> 29:42.882
that's Finley on the left.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.216
DUCKY:
Well, who's that with him?

29:44.250 --> 29:45.417
McGEE:
I know those faces.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.454
It's the Daly brothers.

29:48.487 --> 29:49.521
That's them.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.390
Exotic bird smugglers, my ass.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.492
Well, he hardly
looks under duress.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.161
Oh, no, Finley is no captive.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.930
He was in on it the whole time.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.433
Finley!

30:01.467 --> 30:02.434
Where are you?

30:06.238 --> 30:07.506
(grunts)

30:07.539 --> 30:09.575
I don't believe this.
He knew you'd
come looking

30:09.608 --> 30:11.410
for him and faked
the whole thing.

30:11.443 --> 30:14.546
The beatings, the blood,
the S.O.S., all for show.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.415
A smokescreen.

30:16.448 --> 30:17.416
And now he's on the run.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.085
Not if I can help it.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.252
Come on.

30:29.195 --> 30:33.032
So I gave you the Daly brothers.
What more do you want from me?

30:33.065 --> 30:34.466
They're about to unload
those rocket launchers, Ivan,

30:34.500 --> 30:36.168
and we think you
might know where.

30:36.202 --> 30:37.870
How would I?
I've been out of the game

30:37.904 --> 30:39.105
a long time.
Really?

30:39.138 --> 30:41.908
According to ATF,
the Dalys sold you

30:41.941 --> 30:44.110
eight stolen flatbeds
of cigarettes?

30:44.143 --> 30:45.577
Who knew they were stolen?
That's fine months ago, Ivan.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.379
It's not a very
long time at all.
You know

30:47.413 --> 30:48.580
the Dalys.
Time is short.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.116
Where do they do business?

30:50.149 --> 30:53.219
And if I don't tell you?
What? More dancing?

30:53.252 --> 30:55.054
More good cop/bad cop
routine?

30:55.087 --> 30:57.556
Why don't you stick it
where you keep your brain.

30:57.589 --> 31:00.159
(mock gasp)
Whoa.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.095
That was rude.
That wasn't very nice.

31:03.129 --> 31:04.663
Is he implying
I'm the good cop?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.198
Yeah. That's
what he's saying.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.466
He's saying you're
a very nice cop.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.001
And that you look good
in that jacket.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.536
'Cause I see it
in the spark in his eyes.

31:12.671 --> 31:14.340
(yelling)

31:14.373 --> 31:16.408
McGEE:
Are you saying I'm the good cop?

31:16.442 --> 31:18.144
Get him off me!
Yeah, I-I...

31:18.177 --> 31:19.511
I would, but, you know, he's...

31:19.545 --> 31:21.280
he's actually scaring me.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.449
Okay. I know a place!
Just get off me!

31:24.250 --> 31:25.985
(gasps, pants)

31:26.018 --> 31:27.586
Good. Write it down.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.288
Use your good hand.

31:29.321 --> 31:30.489
Damn.

31:30.522 --> 31:31.657
All right.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.660
Next time
I hold your leash.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.595
(scribbling)

31:36.628 --> 31:40.332
You still think
about it a lot?

31:40.366 --> 31:43.102
At night mostly, yeah.

31:43.135 --> 31:46.172
I play it over and over
in my head, see...

31:46.205 --> 31:48.407
what I could have done
differently.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.409
Replay it. Walk me through.
Gibbs,

31:50.442 --> 31:52.945
you were on the review board;
you know what happened.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.047
I reviewed the report--
I never saw this.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.282
(siren wailing in distance)

31:56.315 --> 31:58.150
It was a robbery case,
wasn't it?

32:00.119 --> 32:01.620
Yeah.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.323
Navy Logistics Depot.

32:05.624 --> 32:09.561
NCIS sent me to Philly
to join a task force.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.097
Your partner. Shaw?

32:12.464 --> 32:14.433
Emily Shaw.

32:14.466 --> 32:17.103
Port Authority cop.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.206
Smart.

32:20.239 --> 32:21.740
Funny.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.009
Friend.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.179
Friend.

32:27.213 --> 32:30.616
She, uh, and her husband
used to invite me over.

32:30.649 --> 32:33.019
Lived in Upper Darby,
had a one-year-old.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.321
Made me feel at home.

32:35.354 --> 32:38.024
Till that night.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.059
Yeah. We were, um...

32:41.527 --> 32:44.163
...parked around here.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.065
And we were...

32:46.098 --> 32:49.335
we were waiting on these...
these two suspects.

32:49.368 --> 32:51.070
We were s...

32:51.103 --> 32:53.372
staked out for hours.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.041
Her husband called?

32:55.074 --> 32:58.010
The baby wanted
to say good night.

32:58.044 --> 32:59.178
(phone rings)
Hang on a second.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.613
Never should've answered
the phone.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.983
Hi.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.387
She got out.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.390
(gunshot)

33:11.423 --> 33:14.126
Kept shooting.
They just kept shooting,

33:14.160 --> 33:15.661
and I tried to...
tried to get to her,

33:15.694 --> 33:18.597
and I... I couldn't get to her.

33:18.630 --> 33:22.301
And I kept saying,
"I'm coming, I'm coming," and...

33:22.334 --> 33:24.203
and I-I couldn't reach her.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.272
And she... she bled out.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.240
She bled out on the floor.
Coroner said

33:28.274 --> 33:29.675
she was dead
in 20 seconds.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.377
That's too many seconds,
Gibbs, it was

33:31.410 --> 33:33.112
too many seconds. She died.
That when you quit

33:33.145 --> 33:35.247
active duty and became
a training officer?

33:35.281 --> 33:37.449
Yes. I thought...

33:37.483 --> 33:40.652
it would get better with time.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.521
It hasn't.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.392
You're still
blaming yourself.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.794
Well, if I hadn't let
her out of the car,

33:48.827 --> 33:50.729
she may be still alive.

33:50.762 --> 33:53.299
Or you're both dead.
Inside the car,

33:53.332 --> 33:56.335
outside the car, Quinn,
you were in an ambush.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.203
37 bullet holes in the car,

33:57.236 --> 33:59.271
and you still killed
one of the shooters.

33:59.305 --> 34:00.406
Yeah. So?

34:02.541 --> 34:04.576
What are you leaving out?

34:04.610 --> 34:08.314
If that's the whole story,
you'd be past it by now.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.416
You know what
always got me?

34:10.449 --> 34:12.318
How it derailed
someone as tough as you

34:12.351 --> 34:14.420
for as long as it did.
Really?!

34:14.453 --> 34:17.356
As t... as tough as me?
Really, Gibbs?

34:17.389 --> 34:21.093
You don't know anything
until you walk in my shoes.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.261
What wasn't in the report?

34:22.294 --> 34:26.365
Alex, j-just say it.
Just... just say it.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.501
I was distracted, too. Okay?

34:29.535 --> 34:31.337
I was distracted.

34:31.370 --> 34:32.571
(distorted):
What would you like me to do?

34:32.604 --> 34:33.739
I was engaged.

34:33.772 --> 34:34.406
I'll take mine outside.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.208
And Mike and I were fighting,

34:36.242 --> 34:37.376
and he called.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.444
And I answered the phone,

34:38.477 --> 34:40.279
and she got out of that car

34:40.312 --> 34:42.148
to give me privacy.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.283
And I let her.

34:44.316 --> 34:46.618
QUINN:
Shaw!

34:46.652 --> 34:50.522
SHAW:
Alex! I'm hit! Alex! Alex!

34:50.556 --> 34:54.626
Help me! Alex!
Please! Don't let me die!

34:54.660 --> 34:55.794
Don't let me die.

34:58.864 --> 35:01.200
(sobbing)

35:01.233 --> 35:06.472
(siren wailing)
Em! No! No, no, no, no...

35:06.505 --> 35:09.308
(distorted, echoing):
Can I get help?!

35:09.341 --> 35:10.876
(siren approaching)

35:12.644 --> 35:15.247
(siren wailing in distance))

35:17.749 --> 35:22.521
And if I did not,
she would be alive today.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.559
You're why others are alive.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.596
No phone call
killed your friend.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.865
And you didn't, either.

35:35.934 --> 35:38.537
Shooters, Quinn.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.475
Shooters killed her.
Yeah.

35:43.509 --> 35:47.179
(phone ringing)

35:50.516 --> 35:52.484
You gonna get that?

35:52.518 --> 35:53.752
Yeah, McGee?

35:53.785 --> 35:55.354
Boss, Finley's in bed
with the Dalys.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.622
We got a lead on two locations.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.457
Bishop and Reeves are
on their way to one now.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.292
Yeah. Just send me
the other one.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.597
(distant horns beeping, honking)

36:08.934 --> 36:11.503
(train passing)

36:11.537 --> 36:13.705
(dogs barking in distance)

36:26.452 --> 36:27.519
(car alarm chirps)

36:29.355 --> 36:31.223
Where you gonna hide now,
Finley?

36:32.258 --> 36:33.492
Clay.

36:34.660 --> 36:37.863
(exhales)
Mate, I'm sorry.

36:39.931 --> 36:41.933
It was all a lie.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.570
I trusted you.

36:44.603 --> 36:45.671
Clay, you know where I'm at.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.239
I needed the money.

36:47.273 --> 36:48.440
When they offered
to cut me in,

36:48.474 --> 36:49.841
I couldn't say no.
You couldn't?

36:49.875 --> 36:51.310
It's blood money.
I didn't kill

36:51.343 --> 36:52.611
the Navy kid--
if he hadn't come along,

36:52.644 --> 36:54.246
then no one
would've been any the wiser.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.981
Yeah, but when Clayton
did get wise, you faked

36:56.014 --> 36:57.983
your own kidnapping
just to throw us off course.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.885
Look, I think
it would be for the best

36:59.918 --> 37:01.720
if the two of you just left.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.256
The Dalys will be here
any minute.
You're worried

37:04.290 --> 37:05.424
about us now?

37:05.457 --> 37:06.992
Come on, Clay,
you and me are mates.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.563
(panting)

37:11.597 --> 37:13.565
You're not my mate.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.467
She is.

37:15.501 --> 37:18.637
Yeah, and I wouldn't worry
about the Dalys.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.579
What the hell?

37:27.613 --> 37:29.247
Where'd it go?

37:30.015 --> 37:31.550
NCIS!

37:34.620 --> 37:36.021
Is it loaded, Gibbs?

37:36.054 --> 37:37.756
Uh-huh.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.530
Nick!

37:44.563 --> 37:46.365
You shouldn't have.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.999
I should have.
Well, at least until...

37:48.033 --> 37:49.501
Rhonda gets fixed.

37:49.535 --> 37:51.303
Will you forgive me?

37:51.337 --> 37:53.539
There is nothing to forgive.
I mean, especially

37:53.572 --> 37:55.741
after you came out
with a very smart question

37:55.774 --> 37:58.977
that saved the day, and without
kicking down a single door.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.846
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.748
But I'm still not
sure that I'm...

38:02.781 --> 38:04.783
cut out for this, uh...

38:04.816 --> 38:06.518
office life.

38:06.552 --> 38:09.355
You know I'm here for you,
right?

38:09.388 --> 38:11.357
Sure.
No, I mean it.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.824
And change is hard,

38:12.858 --> 38:14.860
but coming
from where you've been

38:14.893 --> 38:16.995
must be even harder.

38:18.530 --> 38:21.500
Well, nothing I can't handle.
Well, if you

38:21.533 --> 38:23.569
have days where
you can't handle it,

38:23.602 --> 38:25.671
you can always come talk to me.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.806
Okay.

38:29.408 --> 38:30.509
Thanks.
No.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.111
Thank you-- for my new printer.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.513
(grunts happily)

38:34.546 --> 38:37.383
It's the same kind McGee has.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.750
(laughs):
It is? Oh, wow.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.652
I didn't realize that.

38:40.686 --> 38:41.887
(laughs)

38:49.495 --> 38:51.497
(clicks tongue, taps keyboard)

38:56.602 --> 38:58.804
(beeping)

39:06.978 --> 39:09.648
Well... they
weren't kidding--

39:09.681 --> 39:12.150
you really have
a boat down here.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.920
It's not finished.
Work in progress.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.889
Yeah. Aren't we all.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.658
How'd it go with Shaw's husband?

39:21.527 --> 39:23.629
You know, even better
than I hoped.

39:23.662 --> 39:26.131
We had a long talk, and...

39:26.164 --> 39:28.800
The kid is 13 years old now.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.802
Couldn't believe it.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.838
Time goes fast.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.676
Thank you, Gibbs.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.546
Thank you for sending
me to Philly.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.081
You know, if you hadn't,
I'd still be running in place,

39:43.114 --> 39:47.018
or treading water, or
I don't know, pick a metaphor.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.654
Stuck.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.622
Stuck. That's it.

39:50.656 --> 39:53.559
It's a work in progress,
you know?

39:53.592 --> 39:55.727
I have a lot of damage

39:55.761 --> 39:57.596
to undo.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.599
Like your engagement.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.934
Whatever happened
to that guy?

40:02.968 --> 40:05.704
Man, you don't miss
a detail.

40:05.737 --> 40:06.872
It's our job.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.875
Well, what I told you yesterday

40:09.908 --> 40:12.644
not only ended
my career as a field agent...

40:12.678 --> 40:13.845
Temporarily.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.050
It ended that relationship.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.819
And a few others.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.588
Safe to say,

40:22.621 --> 40:25.957
uh, may have a commitment
problem now. (laughs)

40:25.991 --> 40:27.693
Something else to work on.

40:27.726 --> 40:29.728
Yeah.

40:30.896 --> 40:32.664
Also like how the hell

40:32.698 --> 40:34.800
you're gonna get this boat
out of here.
