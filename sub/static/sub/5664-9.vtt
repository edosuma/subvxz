WEBVTT

00:00.836 --> 00:02.884
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...

00:02.885 --> 00:05.432
He that I love has returned to my side.

00:05.433 --> 00:06.138
We need to stop him

00:06.139 --> 00:07.606
before this Hidden One

00:07.607 --> 00:09.010
drains The Eye's energy out of Jenny.

00:09.011 --> 00:10.745
Mills requested all this from tactical.

00:10.746 --> 00:12.114
You don't owe me this, Foster.

00:12.115 --> 00:13.682
But I need you to find her.

00:13.683 --> 00:15.684
This is rescue mission; pure and simple.

00:15.685 --> 00:17.886
Fire in the hole! We go in hard and fast.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.889
If Pandora and her boyfriend get
in our face, we put them down.

00:22.291 --> 00:23.091
Don't...

00:23.092 --> 00:23.925
Hold on, I'm gonna

00:23.926 --> 00:24.893
get you out of here.

00:28.598 --> 00:30.766
Abbie...

00:30.767 --> 00:31.867
Lieutenant!

00:37.073 --> 00:38.540
Abbie.

00:39.575 --> 00:41.143
Two at the entrance.

00:41.144 --> 00:43.211
Four on rotation.

00:43.212 --> 00:45.580
Standard two-by-two formation.

00:45.581 --> 00:47.482
- Good morrow.
- Good morrow.

00:47.483 --> 00:49.484
Do you expect resistance?

00:49.485 --> 00:51.950
William Erskine is quartermaster general

00:51.951 --> 00:53.221
to Cornwallis.

00:53.222 --> 00:55.715
The supply charts he has in that
house will tell us everything

00:55.716 --> 00:58.160
about every British garrison in New York.

00:58.161 --> 01:00.378
So ostentatious.

01:01.130 --> 01:03.331
Typical British.

01:05.501 --> 01:07.168
Idiot.

01:13.009 --> 01:14.609
If the lobsterbacks see
you, this mission is over

01:14.610 --> 01:16.845
- before it's begun.
- I made certain I was out of view.

01:16.846 --> 01:18.079
They have eyes everywhere.

01:19.225 --> 01:20.401
Why Washington thought

01:20.402 --> 01:22.837
it necessary to include you
in this mission is beyond me.

01:22.838 --> 01:24.905
Does the Hale family have
something on the general?

01:24.906 --> 01:27.907
Betsy...

01:27.908 --> 01:29.543
Nathan, contrary to accounts

01:29.544 --> 01:33.046
in colonial pamphlets, British
officers are not stupid.

01:33.047 --> 01:36.349
In addition to soldiers, they
employ Loyalist civilians.

01:36.350 --> 01:38.084
They patrol this area.

01:38.085 --> 01:39.920
And they are trained...

01:39.921 --> 01:42.055
to spot the glint of a lens.

01:42.056 --> 01:44.691
Two important things to learn:

01:44.692 --> 01:46.793
Patience and caution.

01:47.929 --> 01:49.863
Unlike the proverbial cat,

01:49.864 --> 01:51.364
you have but one life.

01:51.365 --> 01:54.100
Do not indulge in recklessness.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074

02:35.409 --> 02:37.777
Damn! He's gone.

02:51.125 --> 02:54.060
What is this thing that's so important

02:54.061 --> 02:56.463
you had to piss off a bunch
of apocalyptic cultists?

02:56.464 --> 02:58.231
The Lydian Jug.

02:58.232 --> 02:59.733
According to legend,

02:59.734 --> 03:01.835
Orpheus used that very jug

03:01.836 --> 03:04.437
to locate Eurydice when she
was whisked off to Hades.

03:04.438 --> 03:06.139
And... Yes! This...

03:06.140 --> 03:08.275
this third-century Persian account

03:08.276 --> 03:10.977
states that I can use the jug

03:10.978 --> 03:14.247
to activate the, uh, locator spell

03:14.248 --> 03:17.584
to reach the Lieutenant, even
if she was in another dimension.

03:17.585 --> 03:20.620
Granted, the spell is most effective

03:20.621 --> 03:22.289
if used immediately
after the disappearance.

03:22.290 --> 03:24.157
Come on, it's been over a month.

03:24.158 --> 03:26.092
- It's not really been tested.
- You're grasping

03:26.093 --> 03:27.494
at straws.

03:27.495 --> 03:29.262
The Lieutenant's spirit is strong.

03:29.263 --> 03:32.299
She may be hurt, she may be
suffering, but she is alive.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.466
It is up

03:33.467 --> 03:35.035
to me to find her.

03:35.036 --> 03:37.337
It's up to us, Crane.

03:38.940 --> 03:41.274
Abbie sacrificed herself to save me,

03:41.275 --> 03:44.978
so, trust me, we all want to find her.

03:47.715 --> 03:49.716
Yes, of course. I...

03:49.717 --> 03:52.052
I would never imply...

03:52.053 --> 03:55.388
It's okay, Crane.

04:11.072 --> 04:13.006
We have a lead...

04:13.007 --> 04:14.074
on an artifact.

04:14.075 --> 04:15.675
Something that could

04:15.676 --> 04:18.144
help us track Pandora and the Hidden One.

04:18.146 --> 04:20.846
The idea is find the bad guys, find Abbie.

04:20.848 --> 04:22.649
We'll need assistance
to find this artifact.

04:22.650 --> 04:27.054
No, no, no. Let us take
the ball for a while.

04:27.055 --> 04:29.923
If you burn out, you're of no good to us.

04:29.924 --> 04:31.024
Or Abbie.

04:34.162 --> 04:36.897
Right. Uh...

04:36.898 --> 04:39.499
I-I could use a little respite.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.368
We will find her, Crane.

04:41.369 --> 04:42.869
Mm-hmm.

04:56.250 --> 05:00.353
I know you are displeased, my love.

05:00.354 --> 05:03.090
But all will be set right

05:03.091 --> 05:04.858
with the fullness of time.

05:04.859 --> 05:07.694
You dare speak to me of time.

05:07.695 --> 05:11.164
I, who have slumbered for millennia.

05:15.236 --> 05:19.239
Humanity has spread
unchecked across this world,

05:19.240 --> 05:21.641
ravishing it like locusts.

05:21.642 --> 05:26.079
Yet instead of purging this horde,

05:26.080 --> 05:29.950
I only have the strength for parlor tricks.

05:29.951 --> 05:32.252
I share your frustration.

05:32.253 --> 05:35.088
Had the Witnesses not intervened...

05:35.089 --> 05:37.324
The fault does not lie with the Witnesses.

05:37.325 --> 05:38.992
It is with you.

05:38.993 --> 05:43.463
Because of your inadequacies,
we now hide like slaves.

05:43.464 --> 05:47.634
I have found another way...

05:47.635 --> 05:48.835
to return you

05:48.836 --> 05:50.637
to your full power.

05:50.638 --> 05:53.106
A remnant of the pithos I once gave you.

05:54.175 --> 05:56.009
I thought it had been destroyed.

05:56.010 --> 05:57.911
Rescued from the debris.

05:58.913 --> 06:00.113
Even a fragment of the box

06:00.114 --> 06:01.815
holds enough power to give you

06:01.816 --> 06:04.084
what you need.

06:05.701 --> 06:07.797
_

06:08.994 --> 06:10.461
_

07:02.279 --> 07:03.440
_

07:03.724 --> 07:05.153
_

07:05.823 --> 07:07.346
_

07:07.948 --> 07:09.998
_

07:42.283 --> 07:44.384
Where are you?

07:57.632 --> 07:59.633
Why are you following me?

08:02.904 --> 08:04.972
Who says I'm following you?

08:04.973 --> 08:07.808
Maybe I just like hanging
out in creepy ruins.

08:07.809 --> 08:09.242
You seem to.

08:09.243 --> 08:11.812
Is that a crime, Agent Foster?

08:11.813 --> 08:14.081
No.

08:14.082 --> 08:16.817
But kidnapping is. As is murder.

08:16.818 --> 08:20.387
As is making an FBI agent
mysteriously disappear,

08:20.388 --> 08:24.157
creating lots of extra work for
everyone in that agent's office.

08:24.158 --> 08:26.827
Okay, I made that last part up.

08:26.828 --> 08:29.463
What were you doing in here?

08:29.464 --> 08:31.398
What did you see?

08:31.399 --> 08:32.399
Not much.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.900
Just heard you muttering.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.902
Thessalian, right?

08:35.903 --> 08:38.572
You know ancient Greek dialects?

08:38.573 --> 08:40.107
A few.

08:40.107 --> 08:42.142
You know, it's kind of a big deal

08:42.143 --> 08:44.678
when an FBI agent goes missing.

08:44.679 --> 08:47.014
Given that you were the
last person to see her,

08:47.015 --> 08:49.683
you've become what we
call a person of interest,

08:49.684 --> 08:51.318
so I'm gonna ask you again,

08:51.319 --> 08:53.253
what were you doing in here?

08:53.254 --> 08:56.657
If the FBI wishes to formally
charge me with a crime,

08:56.658 --> 08:59.993
please, be my guest.

08:59.994 --> 09:02.162
But until then,

09:02.163 --> 09:04.397
leave me alone.

10:06.164 --> 10:11.097
<b>Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.</b>

10:21.688 --> 10:23.222
The Blavatsky Map.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.724
Know it?

10:24.725 --> 10:25.725
Jenny Mills.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.259
Last time you came to see me,

10:27.260 --> 10:29.662
I had to ice my face for a week.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.097
That should buy a lot of ice.

10:31.765 --> 10:32.999
The map?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.268
Yes, the map of Helena Blavatsky,

10:35.269 --> 10:36.869
19th-century Russian occultist.

10:36.870 --> 10:40.439
Claimed it allowed her to
track demonic presences.

10:41.575 --> 10:43.276
I don't have it.

10:43.277 --> 10:45.857
But you know where it is, right?

10:54.354 --> 10:56.934
Maybe this will change your mind.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.496
I need to make sure it's real.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.967
You really think this map will work?

11:07.968 --> 11:09.302
I don't know.

11:09.303 --> 11:11.070
All I know is we had to do something

11:11.071 --> 11:12.705
to get Crane to stand down.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.707
I mean, we're all taking
this thing with a heavy heart,

11:14.708 --> 11:16.742
but he is really flailing.

11:16.743 --> 11:20.212
That's why I had to get him
to see: we will find Abbie.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.249
- How can you be so sure?
- Because there's no alternative.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.680
- Lovely piece.
- So where's the map?

11:26.681 --> 11:29.055
Atticus Nevins bought it earlier this year,

11:29.056 --> 11:31.624
but after he pulled his Jimmy Hoffa act,

11:31.625 --> 11:33.793
every relic hunter, dealer
and wannabe came to town,

11:33.794 --> 11:35.294
raided his entire collection.

11:35.295 --> 11:39.265
The Blavatsky Map ended up
with your old pal Randall.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.467
- Great.
- Randall...

11:41.468 --> 11:44.870
as in Randall who wanted to
drive a stick through my temple?

11:54.481 --> 11:55.915
Still locked in on our international

11:55.916 --> 11:57.483
man of mystery?

11:57.484 --> 11:59.819
- What do you got?
- Same old.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.687
He looks through his
books, walks in the woods,

12:01.688 --> 12:03.089
shouts at the sky.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.790
Anything we can act on?

12:04.791 --> 12:06.192
Not unless you want to arrest him

12:06.193 --> 12:08.628
for crimes against fashion.

12:08.629 --> 12:11.697
We're missing something.
This guy is wrong. I know it.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.300
He's the only one that can
tell us what happened to Abbie

12:14.301 --> 12:15.768
the night she disappeared.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.469
I'm gonna get a warrant to tap his phone.

12:22.676 --> 12:25.144
You know, I took this
biology class in college.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.879
We learned about an experiment

12:26.880 --> 12:29.649
where they train a bunch of
dogs to bring back a toy duck.

12:29.650 --> 12:32.284
Only, when they set them loose in a field,

12:32.285 --> 12:34.553
no duck. Scientists
never put one out there.

12:34.554 --> 12:38.624
It wasn't long before
the dogs got depressed,

12:38.625 --> 12:42.561
stopped eating, fought with each other...

12:42.562 --> 12:44.296
You see what I'm getting at?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.033
That scientists are jerks?

12:47.034 --> 12:52.338
Yes, definitely that, and also,

12:52.339 --> 12:54.640
stress will mess you up.

12:54.641 --> 12:58.144
That cabin you like by West Point...

12:58.145 --> 12:59.879
why don't you take a long weekend?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.348
Some fresh air, sunshine,

13:02.349 --> 13:04.884
chop some wood...

13:04.885 --> 13:07.386
I don't know what people do out in cabins.

13:07.387 --> 13:12.725
Just... just go and clear your head.

13:12.726 --> 13:15.428
I'll put in for the phone tap warrant.

13:16.530 --> 13:20.399
- Biology, huh?
- Mm.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.668
I thought you majored in archaeology.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.704
I did.

13:24.705 --> 13:27.840
I'm a very complex person.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.236
Hmm.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.905
Hello?

15:01.301 --> 15:03.035
Lieutenant?

15:36.126 --> 15:38.063
_

16:15.609 --> 16:17.042
Ichabod Crane.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.778
How'd you get into my apartment?

16:19.779 --> 16:21.514
- Agent Foster?
- Yeah.

16:21.515 --> 16:23.516
Agent Foster, the person
you just tried to punk.

16:23.517 --> 16:26.252
I have no earthly idea what you are saying,

16:26.253 --> 16:28.587
- in more ways than one.
- You didn't leave this message?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.356
- What message?
- I told Reynolds

16:30.357 --> 16:33.359
you were a harmless kook,
and now you go and...

16:33.360 --> 16:34.460
Agent Foster!

16:34.461 --> 16:35.894
What message?

16:38.752 --> 16:40.008
_

16:40.200 --> 16:41.634
You're paying the security deposit.

16:41.635 --> 16:45.204
Did you see or hear anything?

16:45.205 --> 16:46.572
A weird wind.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.513
Figured you were messing with me.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.744
So this wasn't you?

16:53.647 --> 16:55.781
Then who did this?

16:55.782 --> 16:57.750
Someone who is trying to send us a message.

16:58.952 --> 17:00.953
Though why she could choose

17:00.954 --> 17:04.490
to communicate through you is, um...

17:07.227 --> 17:08.460
May I?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.463
What are you doing?

17:10.464 --> 17:13.766
I need to check something
on your arm, if I may?

17:13.767 --> 17:16.268
Thank you.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.144
What the hell...?

17:25.145 --> 17:29.248
It is part of a message
that I received, as well.

17:31.952 --> 17:33.919
This is crazy.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.022
We have both been contacted
by an outside force,

17:37.023 --> 17:40.259
and given identical mysteries.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.661
Not identical.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.230
They're mirror images.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.215
Lieutenant...

18:07.988 --> 18:09.054
Help me, Crane.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.160
Are you okay?

18:14.161 --> 18:16.829
What the hell was that?

18:16.830 --> 18:19.398
It was Abbie.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.802
She's dying.

18:34.569 --> 18:36.102
Hold it.

18:36.103 --> 18:38.138
The Dynamic Duo!

18:38.807 --> 18:41.671
Come on and pull up a
chair, have some champagne.

18:41.672 --> 18:43.571
No, thanks.

18:43.572 --> 18:45.340
Just came by to talk some business.

18:45.341 --> 18:49.010
Oh. Hold on. Hold on. Let me guess.

18:49.011 --> 18:51.780
I'm seeing... a map.

18:51.781 --> 18:53.548
Maybe Russian?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.917
Damn, these artifacts must be rubbing off.

18:55.918 --> 18:58.386
A brother got powers now.

18:59.522 --> 19:01.356
McKenna called.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.725
Said something about
not owing you any favors.

19:03.726 --> 19:04.759
How much for the map?

19:04.760 --> 19:06.561
Well, let's see...

19:06.562 --> 19:09.698
Last time I saw you, you left
my ass handcuffed to a bathtub.

19:09.699 --> 19:11.866
How much you think I
should collect for that?

19:11.867 --> 19:13.435
That was just business.

19:13.436 --> 19:15.070
Sometimes it's not just business.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.471
Come on.

19:18.641 --> 19:22.911
Like you haven't been handcuffed
by a girl in a motel before.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.312
Come on, Jenny.

19:24.313 --> 19:25.981
You don't have to do this.

19:25.982 --> 19:27.549
Let's go.

19:27.550 --> 19:29.718
Damn, Mills.

19:29.719 --> 19:31.219
No shame.

19:31.220 --> 19:33.054
Always liked that about you.

19:33.055 --> 19:35.290
I'll tell you what.

19:35.291 --> 19:36.825
I was gonna have Howie

19:36.826 --> 19:39.961
and Russell here beat the crap out of you,

19:39.962 --> 19:42.831
but for old times' sake, I'll
let you leave in one piece.

19:43.966 --> 19:45.834
You know what's funny?

19:45.835 --> 19:48.069
I didn't even know I had that map.

19:48.070 --> 19:50.238
But once I heard you were looking for it,

19:50.239 --> 19:52.908
I made sure to find it
and put it somewhere safe.

19:52.909 --> 19:55.343
So...

19:55.344 --> 19:56.912
thanks for the heads-up.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.087
Tell me you got it.

20:05.088 --> 20:06.855
He's not too bright, is he?

20:06.856 --> 20:08.290
Dumb as a bag of hammers.

20:13.162 --> 20:15.330
Here.

20:15.331 --> 20:18.166
This is the Shinto symbol for "gateway."

20:18.167 --> 20:21.503
Now, there are assorted rituals
for activating such gateways,

20:21.504 --> 20:24.639
but we may need to build one first.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.942
Out of what?

20:33.616 --> 20:35.851
There's a tribe in New Guinea

20:35.852 --> 20:38.787
that believes mirrors are so powerful,

20:38.788 --> 20:41.022
they don't have a word for it, so instead,

20:41.023 --> 20:44.126
they indicate mirrors
by showing what they do.

20:44.127 --> 20:45.894
Mirror images.

20:45.895 --> 20:48.063
She wants us to build a
gateway out of a mirror.

20:48.064 --> 20:51.466
- Yeah.
- I believe we have one

20:51.467 --> 20:54.970
stored behind here. Yes.

20:54.971 --> 20:58.173
So, all this,

20:58.174 --> 21:02.511
this is, um, your personal library?

21:02.512 --> 21:03.879
Uh, not all mine.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.547
It's been cultivated over the centuries.

21:05.548 --> 21:08.817
First by the Founding
Fathers, and most recently

21:08.818 --> 21:12.888
by the late Sheriff August Corbin.

21:12.889 --> 21:15.324
All... vital tools

21:15.325 --> 21:18.660
for the war against evil.

21:20.396 --> 21:23.432
Believe it or not, I know how you feel.

21:23.433 --> 21:25.834
'Twas not long ago

21:25.835 --> 21:27.869
that I, too, was in the dark.

21:29.539 --> 21:33.542
And truth be told, life would
be far simpler if I still were.

21:33.543 --> 21:36.445
But, as with every war,

21:36.446 --> 21:40.449
what we do not know can
most certainly harm us.

22:01.938 --> 22:04.518
The sentries have changed their pattern.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.992
We must retreat.

22:14.784 --> 22:17.364
Oh, no... Hale.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.321
What is he doing?

22:20.890 --> 22:22.724
I told him to stay at the base.

22:22.725 --> 22:24.927
The fool's brave, I'll give him that.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.929
We must assist.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.631
You there... stop!

22:29.632 --> 22:31.300
Stop him!

22:33.336 --> 22:35.337
There's nothing we can do.

22:35.338 --> 22:37.973
He will hang.

22:37.974 --> 22:39.775
Spies do not get a trial.

22:39.776 --> 22:42.811
If we don't leave now, we
will share the same fate.

22:42.812 --> 22:45.614
Look there! At the treeline!

22:45.615 --> 22:46.849
Look there! Through the gate!

22:58.661 --> 23:02.564
So why are we doing this
in your, uh, dungeon?

23:03.933 --> 23:07.102
The Masonic cell concentrates
mystical energies.

23:07.103 --> 23:10.739
Gives us the best chance
to bridge dimensions.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.208
I need you to anchor me.

23:13.209 --> 23:16.245
Whoa, buy a girl a drink
first, why don't you?

23:19.816 --> 23:21.183
Sorry.

23:21.184 --> 23:23.318
I'm just a little... little nervous.

23:23.319 --> 23:26.288
This is my first "rescue a lost spirit

23:26.289 --> 23:28.229
from another dimension" mission.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.362
If the Lieutenant were here,

23:33.363 --> 23:35.030
she would say something...

23:35.031 --> 23:37.232
tough yet encouraging,

23:37.233 --> 23:40.469
of which I would wholeheartedly concur.

23:40.470 --> 23:43.338
She is very good at that.

23:44.741 --> 23:47.443
I get why you want to find her so badly.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.936
_

24:01.436 --> 24:02.837
_

24:03.325 --> 24:05.695
_

24:06.103 --> 24:08.404
_

24:40.130 --> 24:41.730
Ah! Oh...

25:37.562 --> 25:39.529
That thing wasn't human.

25:39.530 --> 25:40.864
And it wanted to kill us.

25:40.865 --> 25:42.499
Presumably.

25:44.402 --> 25:46.436
We were supposed to be rescuing Mills,

25:46.437 --> 25:49.272
not facing down living nightmares.

25:49.273 --> 25:51.875
Evil engages us when we least expect it.

25:51.876 --> 25:55.712
So you had no way of knowing that that...

25:55.713 --> 25:58.315
that thing would come through?

25:58.316 --> 26:00.484
Well, the ancient texts

26:00.485 --> 26:02.252
say the gateway spell

26:02.253 --> 26:05.655
is often used for darker purposes.

26:05.656 --> 26:08.158
You knew you might summon a monster?

26:08.159 --> 26:11.128
I thought the Lieutenant
had calculated a way

26:11.129 --> 26:12.629
to appropriate the spell.

26:12.630 --> 26:14.398
You wanted to find Abbie so badly

26:14.399 --> 26:16.833
you allowed a demon to play you.

26:16.834 --> 26:18.435
You're the reason it's in our world.

26:18.436 --> 26:19.836
I took a chance.

26:19.837 --> 26:21.905
Working with the supernatural is not

26:21.906 --> 26:24.107
an unequivocal science, and
if the Lieutenant were here

26:24.108 --> 26:25.342
she would tell you...

26:25.343 --> 26:26.576
She's not here.

26:26.577 --> 26:27.677
I am.

26:27.678 --> 26:29.312
And I don't need to

26:29.313 --> 26:30.480
be Abbie Mills to see

26:30.481 --> 26:32.315
that you are pushing too hard.

26:32.316 --> 26:35.152
You insisted on
participating in this mission.

26:35.153 --> 26:36.620
Why was that?

26:38.422 --> 26:40.290
I may not know about the supernatural,

26:40.291 --> 26:42.392
but I know when someone screws up.

26:53.638 --> 26:55.705
You don't think I'm to blame, do you?

26:55.706 --> 26:59.242
What I think's not important,
Crane. What do you think?

27:01.379 --> 27:03.880
Who asked you, anyway?

27:15.860 --> 27:17.727
Local cops found a body

27:17.728 --> 27:19.896
and the death is unusual.

27:19.897 --> 27:22.299
This might be the work
of our mirror monster.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.701
I-I don't know enough about

27:24.702 --> 27:27.637
this stuff to know what to look for, so...

27:29.040 --> 27:31.308
Thanks.

27:31.309 --> 27:33.677
- Pleasure.
- Victim was a car thief.

27:33.678 --> 27:36.046
He stopped to ditch a hot ride
in the parking lot of a diner,

27:36.047 --> 27:37.247
but didn't get very far.

27:37.248 --> 27:38.315
A witness said she saw a woman

27:38.316 --> 27:40.250
in white running from the scene.

27:40.251 --> 27:42.018
Also, uh...

27:44.388 --> 27:45.855
I have experienced firsthand

27:45.856 --> 27:48.825
the creature that created these marks.

27:49.660 --> 27:51.161
Where's the diner?

27:51.162 --> 27:52.262
Off Route 10.

27:53.231 --> 27:54.864
Away from town.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.934
I must examine the area.

28:04.208 --> 28:05.842
According to my research,

28:05.843 --> 28:07.244
this is an onryo,

28:07.245 --> 28:09.045
a Japanese vengeance demon.

28:09.046 --> 28:11.548
Typically associated with
the spirits of wronged women,

28:11.549 --> 28:14.184
but this particular one
feeds off desperation.

28:14.185 --> 28:16.853
The locator spell I cast must
have brought it to the area.

28:16.854 --> 28:18.955
And it focused on me because of my...

28:18.956 --> 28:21.458
emotional state.

28:21.459 --> 28:23.360
So it picked up on your cues

28:23.361 --> 28:24.828
and pretended to be Abbie.

28:25.963 --> 28:27.397
You were catfished.

28:27.398 --> 28:29.199
If that peculiar ichthyic reference

28:29.200 --> 28:30.533
means I was duped,

28:30.534 --> 28:31.902
then yes, you are correct.

28:31.903 --> 28:33.637
Okay, so then why'd it mark me?

28:33.638 --> 28:36.206
Perhaps because you were
present when I cast the spell.

28:36.207 --> 28:38.541
The demon must have assumed we were...

28:38.542 --> 28:39.743
Partners.

28:40.745 --> 28:42.712
I have worked and fought

28:42.713 --> 28:45.048
alongside many people in my time.

28:45.049 --> 28:48.385
It was only recently
that I truly understood

28:48.386 --> 28:50.387
what a partner is.

28:50.388 --> 28:52.989
What it means to have someone
who makes you more than you are

28:52.990 --> 28:54.657
simply by being by your side.

28:55.593 --> 28:59.095
Truly your better half.

29:01.632 --> 29:04.167
You were right.

29:04.168 --> 29:05.902
I acted recklessly.

29:05.903 --> 29:08.071
I get it.

29:08.072 --> 29:10.674
It's not easy losing someone like that.

29:10.675 --> 29:14.944
You speak as if from personal experience.

29:16.514 --> 29:18.248
My parents.

29:18.249 --> 29:21.251
They were archaeologists.

29:21.252 --> 29:24.788
When I was a kid, they went out on a dig.

29:24.789 --> 29:26.790
Mayan ruins.

29:26.791 --> 29:29.459
Officially, their disappearance

29:29.460 --> 29:32.095
was ruled an unsolved mystery,

29:32.096 --> 29:36.032
but local workers swore
they were taken away

29:36.033 --> 29:38.101
by demonic forces.

29:38.102 --> 29:39.836
I tried

29:39.837 --> 29:41.371
to convince myself that it was just

29:41.372 --> 29:42.973
superstition talking.

29:42.974 --> 29:45.608
But you knew there was some truth to it.

29:45.609 --> 29:48.845
So you studied everything
you could on the supernatural.

29:48.846 --> 29:52.215
My whole life I've been looking for proof

29:52.216 --> 29:54.050
that there is another world out there.

29:54.051 --> 29:56.620
And you...

29:56.621 --> 29:58.054
you've been living in it.

30:04.295 --> 30:06.029
It's Foster.

30:06.030 --> 30:07.864
When did this happen?

30:07.865 --> 30:09.966
All right, yeah, got it. Thanks.

30:09.967 --> 30:12.369
They just found another
body with the same marks.

30:12.370 --> 30:14.337
A hitchhiker.

30:14.338 --> 30:15.672
Farther north on Route 10.

30:15.673 --> 30:18.508
That's further away from town.

30:18.509 --> 30:21.644
If desperation truly is the onryo's lure,

30:21.645 --> 30:24.080
it would surely head
to more populated areas.

30:24.081 --> 30:27.017
This road is the opposite direction.

30:27.018 --> 30:29.598
Next closest exit is West Point.

30:31.856 --> 30:33.390
This...

30:33.391 --> 30:35.091
this thing feeds on desperation,

30:35.092 --> 30:36.448
- right?
- Mm.

30:36.449 --> 30:38.762
Could it be tracking not
just people who are desperate,

30:38.763 --> 30:41.031
but people who are desperate to find Abbie?

30:41.032 --> 30:43.867
Its focus could be that specific.

30:45.169 --> 30:46.536
Why?

30:46.537 --> 30:48.538
I think I know where it's headed.

30:48.539 --> 30:51.174
There's only one person who is as desperate

30:51.175 --> 30:53.543
to find out what happened
to Abbie Mills as you.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.015
It's going after Daniel Reynolds.

31:06.236 --> 31:08.337
Our call has been heard, my love.

31:11.742 --> 31:14.677
Soon you will have all you
need to restore your strength.

31:16.813 --> 31:19.482
There is a quicker path.

31:19.483 --> 31:21.317
Find the Witness

31:21.318 --> 31:23.252
that took the Eye.

31:23.253 --> 31:26.455
She no longer exists in this realm.

31:29.726 --> 31:31.227
But if she still lives,

31:31.228 --> 31:33.229
I will hunt her to the ends of time.

31:33.230 --> 31:34.830
I swear it.

31:34.831 --> 31:35.998
Good.

31:37.401 --> 31:39.502
Because if you fail to find her...

31:41.405 --> 31:44.073
I will not suffer alone,

31:44.074 --> 31:46.175
my love.

31:51.848 --> 31:54.917
Randall made three calls
to this storage facility.

31:54.918 --> 31:56.585
The manager said that he paid

31:56.586 --> 31:58.421
for six months, up front, in cash.

31:58.422 --> 32:00.389
What, he just volunteered that information?

32:00.390 --> 32:02.858
I've done business with him before.

32:02.859 --> 32:04.060
You know, someday you're
gonna have to give me

32:04.061 --> 32:05.294
the full rundown on the adventures

32:05.295 --> 32:06.462
of Jenny Mills.

32:06.463 --> 32:08.464
It's not that interesting.

32:11.435 --> 32:13.803
Look, I understand, you know.

32:13.804 --> 32:15.972
You want to keep acting cool, professional.

32:15.973 --> 32:18.074
Stick with what you know.

32:18.075 --> 32:20.443
Because if you can convince yourself

32:20.444 --> 32:22.078
that it's just business as usual,

32:22.079 --> 32:23.813
then the truth of what might have

32:23.814 --> 32:25.481
happened to Abbie can't sink in.

32:27.217 --> 32:30.319
But sooner or later, you are
gonna have to face that truth.

32:32.055 --> 32:33.489
All right? Just...

32:33.490 --> 32:35.470
just remember that you'll be okay.

32:39.563 --> 32:41.297
Oh, yeah?

32:41.298 --> 32:42.965
How do you know that?

32:42.966 --> 32:45.701
'Cause I'm not going anywhere.

33:07.825 --> 33:09.292
Got it.

33:11.128 --> 33:13.748
Nice job.

33:13.864 --> 33:15.865
When you gonna learn, Mills?

33:15.866 --> 33:18.301
I'll always be one step ahead.

33:26.143 --> 33:27.977
Randall, call them off.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.681
I guess your boy

33:31.682 --> 33:32.949
was misbehaving.

33:32.950 --> 33:34.750
Now, where's my phone?

33:36.186 --> 33:37.386
Drop it.

33:42.192 --> 33:45.027
Your guys are sleeping
on the job out there.

33:45.028 --> 33:46.629
You should hire better guys.

33:52.036 --> 33:53.670
Thanks, but, uh...

33:53.671 --> 33:55.405
Dumb and Dumber will be
getting up any second now.

33:55.406 --> 33:56.739
Come on.

34:32.376 --> 34:33.775
The mirror from whence you came,

34:33.777 --> 34:35.777
I was able to hurt you with its glass.

34:35.779 --> 34:37.780
That is your weakness.

34:41.784 --> 34:43.453
Agent Foster!

34:58.235 --> 34:59.736
Damn.

35:13.951 --> 35:16.653
Welcome to the other world.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.858
I have to tell you something.

35:31.859 --> 35:33.626
It's-it's okay, you-you don't have to...

35:33.627 --> 35:36.129
You are so... stupid.

35:36.130 --> 35:38.698
Whoa. Okay. I mean, that's not where
I thought you were going with that.

35:38.699 --> 35:40.700
What else can I do to get you to see?

35:40.701 --> 35:45.138
I am not the kind of person
that talks about feelings

35:45.139 --> 35:46.906
and gets to know you.

35:46.907 --> 35:51.311
I don't share stories
and have relationships.

35:51.312 --> 35:54.314
I'm the person who knocks
heads and moves around.

35:54.315 --> 35:57.217
My world is filled with
Randalls and McKennas.

35:57.218 --> 35:59.219
And-and that's all you want it to be?

35:59.220 --> 36:00.487
Why not?

36:02.089 --> 36:04.290
What good ever came from the other way?

36:05.326 --> 36:07.594
My dad left when I was three.

36:07.595 --> 36:10.430
Mom checked out not long after that.

36:10.431 --> 36:12.332
Even Abbie abandoned me.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.500
And Abbie came back.

36:13.501 --> 36:15.068
Yeah, and now she's gone.

36:15.069 --> 36:16.903
Possibly for good.

36:16.904 --> 36:18.905
Because she was saving me.

36:18.906 --> 36:22.375
She gave up herself for me.

36:32.720 --> 36:36.389
When I thought...

36:36.390 --> 36:38.825
when I thought Randall's
guys had shot you...

36:40.861 --> 36:47.100
I thought, "I lost Abbie, and...

36:47.101 --> 36:49.736
now I'm gonna lose another
person that I love."

37:07.755 --> 37:09.889
Sorry about cutting your weekend short.

37:09.890 --> 37:12.559
Someone called in a Mills sighting.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.894
- Turned out to be a false alarm.
- No worries.

37:14.895 --> 37:16.963
I needed an excuse to
get out of that cabin.

37:16.964 --> 37:18.565
I was starting to go stir-crazy.

37:18.566 --> 37:20.333
Too much fresh air?

37:20.334 --> 37:22.569
And wood chopping.

37:22.570 --> 37:26.573
How's that wiretap warrant going?

37:26.574 --> 37:30.110
I haven't put in for it yet.

37:30.111 --> 37:31.644
Crane dresses funny,

37:31.645 --> 37:34.681
yeah, and-and he talks
like a Jane Austen novel.

37:34.682 --> 37:38.151
But is he really capable of
having done something to Mills?

37:38.152 --> 37:41.254
I know what it's like to need answers.

37:41.255 --> 37:44.357
It can eat at you, make you desperate.

37:44.358 --> 37:45.992
I've seen it happen with...

37:45.993 --> 37:48.862
a friend.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.934
Foster.

37:54.935 --> 37:57.670
Yeah, a-all right. Hold on.

37:57.671 --> 37:59.606
M... Maybe you're right.

37:59.607 --> 38:01.808
Maybe it is time to shift focus.

38:01.809 --> 38:02.976
Yeah.

38:05.780 --> 38:06.880
Yeah.

38:17.158 --> 38:18.992
Justice will not be served.

38:22.630 --> 38:24.464
You draw fire from the flank.

38:24.465 --> 38:26.566
I'll charge them before
they reach the gallows,

38:26.567 --> 38:27.667
lift him on my mount.

38:27.668 --> 38:29.335
We will not need the horses.

38:30.504 --> 38:32.972
Then how do we save him?

38:32.973 --> 38:35.909
We have before you a traitor!

38:35.910 --> 38:38.511
Nathan Hale, a spy,

38:38.512 --> 38:42.882
caught reporting on His
Majesty King George's fleet.

38:42.883 --> 38:46.186
We are here to let him know he's
not alone in his last moments.

38:46.187 --> 38:48.888
Nathan Hale will die a hero.

38:48.889 --> 38:51.157
He's to be hung by the neck until dead,

38:51.158 --> 38:52.392
on this day of Our Lord...

38:52.393 --> 38:53.726
I cannot simply stand by.

38:53.727 --> 38:55.428
The British believe
Hale to be just a rogue.

38:55.429 --> 38:57.363
But if we launched a rescue,

38:57.364 --> 38:58.865
and by some miracle, were able

38:58.866 --> 39:01.734
to save him, they'd be
alerted to our presence.

39:01.735 --> 39:03.736
The redcoats would scour
the area, not just for us

39:03.737 --> 39:06.039
but for all our men, men
who can't leave their posts.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.208
Scores would die.

39:08.209 --> 39:11.544
...his crimes, and as a
warning to others of you,

39:11.545 --> 39:14.447
who would follow in his treacherous path!

39:18.285 --> 39:22.055
I only regret that I have but one life

39:22.056 --> 39:24.490
to give for my country.

39:36.704 --> 39:39.772
He was our partner...

39:39.773 --> 39:42.709
and we just let him die.

39:42.710 --> 39:45.879
Not all our partners will survive.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.881
Sometimes you must accept
that there aren't going to be

39:47.882 --> 39:49.549
any miracles.

39:49.550 --> 39:52.485
The best you can do is
continue your mission.

40:11.071 --> 40:12.705
You're suspending the search?

40:13.641 --> 40:16.175
Oh. No.

40:17.278 --> 40:18.945
I will never cease my efforts

40:18.946 --> 40:20.413
to find the Lieutenant.

40:20.414 --> 40:22.749
But in the past month,

40:22.750 --> 40:25.985
I have allowed nothing
but my single-minded drive

40:25.986 --> 40:27.754
to fill my field of view.

40:27.755 --> 40:29.989
And that led

40:29.990 --> 40:31.991
to terrible consequences.

40:31.992 --> 40:35.495
A friend once told me,

40:35.496 --> 40:39.098
"You must accept that there are
not going to be any miracles."

40:40.334 --> 40:41.768
"The best you can do

40:41.769 --> 40:44.170
is continue your mission."

40:44.171 --> 40:45.705
I believe

40:45.706 --> 40:48.374
the Lieutenant would agree.

40:48.375 --> 40:50.510
- And what is that mission?
- For one,

40:50.511 --> 40:53.513
I must continue the hunt for
Pandora and the Hidden One,

40:53.514 --> 40:55.615
put an end to their evil.

40:55.616 --> 40:56.683
Pandora?

40:56.684 --> 40:58.718
There is much to review.

40:58.719 --> 41:00.820
Crane, you gotta see this.

41:02.990 --> 41:04.123
How's it going?

41:04.124 --> 41:05.792
What is she doing here?

41:05.793 --> 41:07.627
Agent Foster has been most valuable

41:07.628 --> 41:09.629
in helping me deal with a...

41:09.630 --> 41:12.065
sticky situation.

41:12.066 --> 41:13.633
Uh-huh.

41:14.635 --> 41:18.671
You can speak freely.

41:18.672 --> 41:19.706
This map...

41:19.707 --> 41:21.509
shows the energy signatures

41:21.510 --> 41:22.842
of demonic creatures.

41:22.843 --> 41:25.144
It's like, um, a radar
that detects monsters.

41:25.145 --> 41:27.880
We thought we might be able
to use it to locate Pandora.

41:27.881 --> 41:29.215
No dice.

41:29.216 --> 41:33.152
But... we discovered something else.

41:42.596 --> 41:44.764
Each drop represents a demon.

41:44.765 --> 41:46.466
They're converging on...

41:49.169 --> 41:51.037
- Sleepy Hollow.
- Supernatural creatures

41:51.038 --> 41:53.406
from all over the world are headed here.

41:53.407 --> 41:55.375
It's as if someone's summoning them.

41:55.376 --> 41:58.044
- Pandora.
- You're saying

41:58.045 --> 42:01.814
a... monster convention is coming to town?

42:03.751 --> 42:05.518
So... what do we do?

42:05.519 --> 42:07.520
I believe if the Lieutenant were here,

42:07.521 --> 42:11.824
she would urge us to "kick some demon ass."
