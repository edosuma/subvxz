00:05.705 --> 00:08.041
How does the joke begin?

00:08.042 --> 00:11.878
Three men in a bar,
but it's not a bar.

00:11.879 --> 00:13.380
Imagine the Bronx.

00:13.381 --> 00:18.885
A corner, or maybe
a lunchenette.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.620
Three men find themselves in the

00:20.621 --> 00:22.455
same place at the same time.

00:22.456 --> 00:27.227
Sitting at the counter
is Africa bombada.

00:27.228 --> 00:31.131
Across the room is Milly Mel.

00:31.132 --> 00:34.901
Door opens and who
walk compromises, D.J.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.104
And created the musical style

00:37.105 --> 00:39.939
that's become the sound track to

00:39.940 --> 00:41.908
well, the whole wide world.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.144
They nod at each other, screwed

00:44.145 --> 00:46.113
over, cut out of the big money,

00:46.114 --> 00:49.749
or just laugh of a the
absurdy of it all.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.751
Hip hop came from nowhere else,

00:51.752 --> 00:59.092
it could have come from
nowhere else, but the Bronx.

this the Bronx.

01:43.804 --> 01:48.007
You've probably heard about it.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.842
You may even have a pretty solid

01:49.843 --> 01:53.346
image in your head of
what it looks like.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.882
What it is like.

01:55.883 --> 02:00.187
Or maybe you can't
picture it at all.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.655
The south Bronx sounds
familiar as a bad thing.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.056
And the Bronx at one time was

02:04.057 --> 02:06.359
said to be burning, wasn't it?

02:06.360 --> 02:12.199
For the most part, the
Bronx is overlooked, the never visited

02:12.200 --> 02:13.233
borough in New York City, which

02:13.234 --> 02:17.837
is a shame because the Bronx is
a magical place with its own

02:17.838 --> 02:20.173
energy, its own food,
vibe, and rhythm.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.074
You've been to Brooklyn, maybe

02:22.075 --> 02:27.013
it's time you took a
look at the Bronx.

02:27.014 --> 02:30.850
August of 1973, the sister of

02:30.851 --> 02:32.519
D.j. Cool herd was holding a

02:32.520 --> 02:33.753
birthday party for herself in

02:33.754 --> 02:39.292
the basement of 1520
central Avenue.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.361
As he was playing the music on

02:41.362 --> 02:44.096
his two disk turntable, he began

02:44.097 --> 02:49.068
to slow the music down slow the

02:49.069 --> 02:51.204
people stood up and took notice

02:51.205 --> 02:52.572
and began asking him to do it

02:52.573 --> 02:54.241
again, he did it again, they

02:54.242 --> 02:56.209
asked him to do it again, again,

02:56.210 --> 02:57.710
he did it again and attracted

02:57.711 --> 03:00.713
more and more people to his

03:00.714 --> 03:01.382
performances, and people began

03:01.383 --> 03:02.749
to imitate him, and that was the

03:02.750 --> 03:04.217
beginning of hip hop music.

03:04.218 --> 03:10.757
It started in the Bronx.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.760
Moody's records, inside

03:13.761 --> 03:14.794
rummaging for records just like

03:14.795 --> 03:16.896
he used to do is the man, the

03:16.897 --> 03:20.132
legend, one of the very select
few who started it all.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.601
Who created the sound that

03:21.602 --> 03:25.438
hundreds of millions of people
now claim as their own.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.807
Google, who created hip hop?

03:27.808 --> 03:30.810
Go ahead, you get, D.J. Cool.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.579
It's a national landmark, right?

03:32.580 --> 03:35.615
No, it's not, we're
working on it.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.318
It's still the birthplace of

03:38.319 --> 03:40.620
hip hop undisputed because I

03:40.621 --> 03:41.821
didn't start it with four guys

03:41.822 --> 03:45.458
in a club, I was inside
a residential building.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.926
At the time, it wasn't really in

03:46.927 --> 03:51.163
eye over the recreation room.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.600
So she would watch for any

03:53.601 --> 03:55.001
disturbance, it never happened,

03:55.002 --> 03:56.769
and that's how it survived

03:56.770 --> 03:59.606
because good music said itself,

03:59.607 --> 04:00.973
good drug set itself, good

04:00.974 --> 04:04.311
anything set itself, and
this was something good.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.446
Was there a moment when you

04:06.447 --> 04:07.614
realized this is big, this is

04:07.615 --> 04:10.317
going to be, this is going
to spread way beyond my

04:10.318 --> 04:10.651
neighborhood?

04:10.652 --> 04:12.852
Never looked at it as that.

04:12.853 --> 04:16.022
I saw it spreading, but it

04:16.023 --> 04:24.023
reminded me of Fred Flinstone.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.201
It's not going to be nothing.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.037
So to say I don't have money and

04:31.038 --> 04:32.839
all that, I'm rich in other

04:32.840 --> 04:34.974
ways, but time magazine said

04:34.975 --> 04:39.379
when music was created inside
the United States, Louis

04:39.380 --> 04:41.314
Armstrong for jazz, Elvis

04:41.315 --> 04:44.050
Presley for rock and roll, him

04:44.051 --> 04:51.691
and Chuckie Berry, and
cool herc for hip hop.

04:51.692 --> 04:52.526
Feel good?

04:52.526 --> 04:53.327
Very good.

04:53.328 --> 04:55.895
Historically, from the last

04:55.896 --> 04:58.531
third of the 19th century in to

04:58.532 --> 05:01.901
about 1920, it was Germany.

05:01.902 --> 05:05.004
From about 1930 to about 1960,

05:05.005 --> 05:11.678
the second language spoken
in the Bronx was Yiddish.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.846
From 1965 onward, the second

05:13.847 --> 05:19.686
language is Spanish, and
that's the way it is today.

05:19.687 --> 05:23.690
It's got a reputation as a
tough place, crime, street

05:23.691 --> 05:25.692
gangs, a lot of which goes back

05:25.693 --> 05:27.360
to the way it was and some of

05:27.361 --> 05:28.728
which, well like I said, it's

05:28.729 --> 05:32.565
got a reputation as being tough.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.734
The Bronx is, let's face it, a

05:34.735 --> 05:37.269
big blank space in a
lot of people's minds.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.871
Even people like me who live

05:38.872 --> 05:40.873
what, ten minutes away, we don't

05:40.874 --> 05:42.375
know anything about that big

05:42.376 --> 05:45.412
area between Yankees
stadium and the Bronx zoo.

05:45.413 --> 05:48.581
What you should know is
that the Bronx is big.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.116
Really big.

05:49.117 --> 05:51.384
And that it's a patchwork of

05:51.385 --> 05:55.087
ethnic enclaves, a cross
section of the whole world.

05:55.088 --> 06:03.088
Every immigrant group
you could think of.

06:13.807 --> 06:19.311
Justin, aka, Barren Imbrosha is

06:19.312 --> 06:23.082
serving at the
culinary ambassador.

06:23.083 --> 06:23.784
Let the dinner begin.

06:23.785 --> 06:25.485
This is the porcupine.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.620
For the cause of introducing

06:27.621 --> 06:29.422
the delights of this mighty

06:29.423 --> 06:31.991
borough to the ignorant,
well like me.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.760
He's got a show on the TV, and

06:33.761 --> 06:35.294
he throws parties where he

06:35.295 --> 06:37.597
serves creatures that would make

06:37.598 --> 06:39.799
Andrew Zimmer turn gray and

06:39.800 --> 06:42.502
slump unconscious to the floor.

06:42.503 --> 06:46.973
Explorer, and gourmet.

06:46.974 --> 06:50.276
Bronx, it's so multifacetted,

06:50.277 --> 06:51.678
but for some reason this is the

06:51.679 --> 06:54.614
first place I take people.

06:54.615 --> 06:57.183
This is oozes and imminents
that flavor of the Bronx.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.686
And he knows what I like.

06:59.687 --> 07:03.122
Places like this.

07:03.123 --> 07:07.794
188 on 188th street and
the grand concourse.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.630
Old school New York
Puerto Rican good stuff.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.198
Get within 20 feet of this stuff

07:12.199 --> 07:16.469
and prepare to lose
your freaking mind.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.205
It is fried pig.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.641
Ear, tongue, chopped
up and deep fried.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.511
Off cut pig parts, deep fried.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.646
What's not to like about that?

07:26.647 --> 07:27.814
Yeah, the shoulder.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.982
We're going to get
that in there.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.551
Oh yeah.

07:31.552 --> 07:35.187
Big piece of the skin,
just chopped up.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.156
So skin.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.024
Skin and fat?

07:37.024 --> 07:37.825
Yeah.

07:37.826 --> 07:40.026
It's almost like a
little meat candy bar.

07:40.027 --> 07:45.498
That's amazing.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.533
Amazing.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.534
And then what else?

07:47.535 --> 07:49.335
We need this.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.003
Yes.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.340
Puerto Rico on a skew.

07:54.341 --> 07:58.511
The Bronx to me became a
place where I could really

07:58.512 --> 07:59.679
engage my sensibility.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.514
You could really just come here,

08:01.515 --> 08:04.917
eat, drink, wine,
and just indulge.

08:04.918 --> 08:08.387
This is pretty much the center
of the pork universe as

08:08.388 --> 08:11.891
I've ever seen it in New York.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.561
I don't any place porkier
than what I'm looking at.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.428
This is exactly the kind of

08:16.429 --> 08:18.064
thing I thought we'd lost in new

08:18.065 --> 08:19.566
York, that one after the other

08:19.567 --> 08:21.267
faded away in the neighborhood's

08:21.268 --> 08:23.570
I lived in and all along, all

08:23.571 --> 08:25.572
along it was there, underfoot, a

08:25.573 --> 08:27.206
gusher of porky goodness.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.374
There's a great line, which

08:28.375 --> 08:33.245
is they say, in
France, Se la Bronx.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.581
What do you think
this is the Bronx?

08:34.582 --> 08:36.716
And this idea of music's really

08:36.717 --> 08:38.384
mad or someone's making a mess.

08:38.385 --> 08:41.554
To me I take that as
a point of pride.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.590
To be the Bronx, it is where the

08:43.591 --> 08:45.558
music is loud, men are tough,

08:45.559 --> 08:47.627
women are sexy, and
food is spicy.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.261
If those things weren't true.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.731
You wouldn't know
what the Bronx is.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.933
Its bad reputation
is what protects it?

08:53.934 --> 08:56.068
I think the perception, the

08:56.069 --> 08:57.469
perception of it being a place

08:57.470 --> 09:00.907
where the funk is alive.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.809
Incredible, incredible spread.

09:02.810 --> 09:06.112
Yeah, man, this is great.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.279
This is one of the places you'll

09:07.280 --> 09:09.782
dream about, was I really there.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.284
I'm going back to see if
that place is really there.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.153
Lay off this pork.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.589
It's insane.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.660
I'm actually going to
get a to go order.

hop was started.

it's clear uncut garbage.

ground breaking departure from

10:52.119 --> 10:54.253
the lyrics and content
up to that point.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.088
Before we started doing hip

10:56.089 --> 10:57.790
hop music, there was none, we

10:57.791 --> 10:59.391
played everything, disco, we

10:59.392 --> 11:01.894
played ray gay, we played hop,

11:01.895 --> 11:05.564
watched hehaw, that was
the favorite in my house.

11:57.117 --> 12:01.153
king Tim the third, the
second and rappers alike.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.790
I used to live on a fifth floor

12:03.791 --> 12:05.457
walk up, somebody was playing it

12:05.458 --> 12:07.827
next door, fourth floor, the

12:07.828 --> 12:09.829
third floor, second floor.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.463
First floor.

12:10.464 --> 12:14.166
Somebody had a boom box
outside playing it.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.535
The car that drove by had it on.

12:16.536 --> 12:17.837
Nothing that was like a plague,

12:17.838 --> 12:20.873
it was like, it was like locust.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.642
And that's when I realized, you

12:23.643 --> 12:25.311
know, it's something that was

12:25.312 --> 12:27.379
beyond what we was doing
out in the street.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.015
Critically, it's not a great

12:29.016 --> 12:30.682
record, but if you play it right

12:30.683 --> 12:33.986
now, it's still, you know,
it's still a good record.

12:33.987 --> 12:37.824
In this case at least,
history has come around.

12:37.825 --> 12:42.328
Today nobody looks back as
originals or innovators.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.729
People know who did what.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.531
As far as hip hop now, as far

12:45.532 --> 12:47.233
as the music now, these guys are

12:47.234 --> 12:50.669
not trying to tell a story
of their time at all.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.172
Okay, yeah they popped a lot of

12:53.173 --> 12:54.706
bottles, had sex with a lot of

12:54.707 --> 12:56.542
women and drove expensive cars

12:56.543 --> 12:58.177
and nothing else happened.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.846
You would never know there was a

12:59.847 --> 13:02.514
black president, you would never

13:02.515 --> 13:03.582
know there was two wars, it's

13:03.583 --> 13:05.351
not reflected in the music.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.753
And at some point, somebody was

13:07.754 --> 13:09.922
supposed to step up and make

13:09.923 --> 13:11.891
those songs, 20 years from now,

13:11.892 --> 13:14.060
they'll be talking about the

13:14.061 --> 13:16.695
message and planet rock and
all the classic records.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.564
You know what I mean?

13:18.565 --> 13:26.238
That's what it is.

13:26.239 --> 13:30.409
Robert Moses has been
dead over 30 years now.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.710
And people in the Bronx, for the

13:31.711 --> 13:34.881
most part, still hate him.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.216
His role as magser builder...

13:37.217 --> 13:39.218
Master builder, he ran the

13:39.219 --> 13:40.252
parkway system straight through

13:40.253 --> 13:44.423
dozens of working class
neighborhoods, seemingly

13:44.424 --> 13:47.259
uncaring about the destruction
of whole communities.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.095
Massive housing projects

13:49.096 --> 13:50.629
conceived as utopian solutions

13:50.630 --> 13:53.799
to stacking the poor or the

13:53.800 --> 13:55.267
centralized vertical Ge toes

13:55.268 --> 13:56.435
were also his bright idea.

13:56.436 --> 14:00.806
He did leave some pretty
impressive dam works behind

14:00.807 --> 14:06.645
though, like the bridge,
flushing meadows park, the

14:06.646 --> 14:09.648
bridge, the Bronx happens to be

14:09.649 --> 14:15.287
the home of the two largest
parks in New York City.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.924
Helm bay, and you see stuff here

14:17.925 --> 14:21.493
you ain't seen in central park.

14:21.494 --> 14:25.764
It comes from Honduras,
Guatemala, and bell please and

14:25.765 --> 14:27.333
traced they ethnic group back to

14:27.334 --> 14:29.601
a single slave ship that crashed

14:29.602 --> 14:33.605
off St. Vincent and freed
Africans, then mixed with

14:33.606 --> 14:33.840
Indians.

14:33.841 --> 14:35.441
Where is home for many of the

14:35.442 --> 14:37.276
community living in the U.S.?

14:37.277 --> 14:40.312
You guessed it, the Bronx.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.114
Living in the Bronx, you're

14:42.115 --> 14:43.515
able to kind of travel the world

14:43.516 --> 14:44.650
without leaving the borough.

14:44.651 --> 14:45.618
Right.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.653
And you know, it's
like an addiction.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.488
When you go to another country

14:49.489 --> 14:51.023
and the first day in the market,

14:51.024 --> 14:53.125
and all your dreams and smell

14:53.126 --> 14:55.962
the diesel, and you're looking

14:55.963 --> 14:58.297
around, last one thing
you're looking for?

14:58.298 --> 15:05.371
To do that in your own
backyard, it's... cool.

15:05.372 --> 15:10.209
That's coconut soup
with fish... uh-huh.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.478
Over here, we have a tapo.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.381
That looks good.

15:15.382 --> 15:21.487
Banana, and coconut soup.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.721
That sounds good.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.057
Yeah, neck bones and it.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.192
Yeah, let's do it.

15:26.193 --> 15:29.328
So let's put some
plants in here.

15:29.329 --> 15:32.731
Mashed plan tans come with
just about every dish.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.533
Plantations are part of me.

15:34.534 --> 15:38.704
You'll never have it without it.

15:38.705 --> 15:39.072
Yeah.

15:39.073 --> 15:42.041
Same method, same right
hand, same everything.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.909
There's fish and coconut soup.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.544
What kind of fish is this?

15:45.545 --> 15:46.379
Blue fish.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.347
Blue fish.

15:47.348 --> 15:49.715
Awesome, I love blue fish.

15:49.716 --> 15:54.553
And nice smoked neck
bones with bananas.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.856
That's officially
awesome already.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.359
Oh, that's tasty.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.062
It's really good.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.797
Underexploited fish,
one of my favorites.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.733
So you know what I've noticed

16:07.734 --> 16:11.537
already, the Bronx is big.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.539
How ludicrous and shameful is it

16:13.540 --> 16:15.207
that I can literally see my

16:15.208 --> 16:17.376
house from here and I
have no idea where I am?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.411
No fault on your own, but I

16:19.412 --> 16:20.746
think that's what keeps the

16:20.747 --> 16:23.782
Bronx so amazing, you have all

16:23.783 --> 16:26.052
these in touch ethnic enclaves.

16:26.053 --> 16:32.891
I didn't know there
were Hondurans here.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.293
I would say the neck is the next

16:34.294 --> 16:35.062
big thing for years now.

16:35.063 --> 16:36.996
Still waiting.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.802
People from all over the

16:43.803 --> 16:46.238
world reside in the Bronx, as a

16:46.239 --> 16:52.311
matter of fact, we have
residents from every continent

16:52.312 --> 16:52.945
on the face of the earth, and if

16:52.946 --> 16:59.051
you count the penguins in the
Bronx zoo, that includes

16:59.052 --> 17:07.051
Antarctica.

17:13.400 --> 17:21.400
♪

17:36.256 --> 17:38.290
The wellspring of hip hop is

17:38.291 --> 17:40.759
right around here, a mostly

17:40.760 --> 17:44.596
Jamaican community in Bronx
river in the south Bronx.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.931
Jamaicans began arriving here

17:45.932 --> 17:47.599
back in the 50s, and still

17:47.600 --> 17:55.307
today, Jamaican food, culture,
the music, is all over.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.776
Sun dial international
headquarters, makers of

17:57.777 --> 17:59.945
traditional tonics and herbal

17:59.946 --> 18:03.615

institution since the 70s.

18:03.616 --> 18:08.287
This is enough ingredients,
this is the oil.

18:08.288 --> 18:14.126
This one is used for any
type of bodily weaknesses.

18:14.127 --> 18:17.796
Pops Baba as he's called,

18:17.797 --> 18:19.298
grassroots bush doctor, healer,

18:19.299 --> 18:21.967
he uses recipes passed from

18:21.968 --> 18:24.470
mothers and aunties, roots,

18:24.471 --> 18:27.306
spices, herbs, barks, and woods.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.807
Wood root in the morning and

18:28.808 --> 18:30.976
at night, it'll cure
what's wrong with you.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.644
You're going to
have improvement.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.152
Root wood cure for the
blood, bodies, nerves.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.188
Intestinal cleanser and man

18:42.189 --> 18:44.523
back, hopes to get your manhood

18:44.524 --> 18:45.991
back among other things.

18:45.992 --> 18:51.363
About 1956 that I
came to America.

18:51.364 --> 18:54.099
So I could make it in the

18:54.100 --> 18:57.369
apartment in the Bronx river.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.671
And project smell up this roof,

18:59.672 --> 19:01.006
they used to drive them.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.841
Hey, what are you
doing in there?

19:02.842 --> 19:06.345
What kind of hoekus poekus in there doing.

19:06.346 --> 19:10.782
And I'd go in the car, and
I'd sell it in the Bronx.

19:10.783 --> 19:14.353
The Bronx is the best
place in America.

19:14.354 --> 19:18.057
Nowhere like the Bronx.

19:19.459 --> 19:23.895
Up north a ways in west
Jamaica, another working class

19:23.896 --> 19:25.231
community where subway service

19:25.232 --> 19:27.098
is limited and yet people to

19:27.099 --> 19:29.868
have to get up, go to work, and

19:29.869 --> 19:35.607
make the long hump
to another borough.

19:35.608 --> 19:43.608
Afterwards, a person
could use a drink.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.752
And if you're a Jamaican person,

19:46.753 --> 19:48.254
you could use the every day

19:48.255 --> 19:50.088
drink of back home, any time of

19:50.089 --> 19:52.258
day and night, ray and nephew.

19:52.259 --> 19:55.093
It is a very strong Jamaican

19:55.094 --> 19:56.562
white rum that we use from

19:56.563 --> 19:59.398
everything to drinks
here in this bar.

19:59.399 --> 20:03.269
You get it with cranberry
juice, milk, or water.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.404
Water would be in every nephew

20:05.405 --> 20:10.108
would be ray and
nephew in the Bronx.

20:10.109 --> 20:13.111
It's a very fast, free form

20:13.112 --> 20:14.446
riff diatribe about life in the

20:14.447 --> 20:15.614
Bronx and what's happening on

20:15.615 --> 20:18.450
the news, in hip
hop, or last night.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.452
Growing up in the Bronx

20:20.453 --> 20:22.087
the city. Olated from the rest of

20:22.088 --> 20:24.456
you know what I'm saying, the

20:24.457 --> 20:26.992
other city has like city bite,

20:26.993 --> 20:28.294
the Bronx doesn't get that.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.796
People on a boat and go to

20:30.797 --> 20:32.464
Staten island before they
ride up to the Bronx.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.133
I have to reluctantly have to

20:35.134 --> 20:36.802
be part of of the problem.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.137
It's going en to junk if ied,

20:39.138 --> 20:43.442
that's not happening
any time soon.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.676
It's not.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.346
There's no owner right here.

20:47.347 --> 20:51.817
This is the man right here
who made today possible.

20:51.818 --> 20:52.652
Thank you.

20:52.653 --> 20:54.286
I am happy here.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.988
Andly drink more of your ray and

20:56.989 --> 20:58.524
nephew, regardless of what it

20:58.525 --> 21:04.029
might be doing to my brain,
but then, I will eat.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.664
What is this?

21:05.665 --> 21:06.533
Pigtail.

21:06.534 --> 21:08.199
Yeah.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.135
Awesome.

21:09.136 --> 21:13.004
Oh hell, I love this.

21:13.005 --> 21:13.172
Oh.

21:13.173 --> 21:15.707
Man, that looks good.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.843
People sort of, stop paying

21:17.844 --> 21:21.513
attention to the Bronx when
it wasn't burning anymore.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.515
When fort Apache was something

21:23.516 --> 21:24.550
we didn't have to think about.

21:24.551 --> 21:27.018
Let's say this is the
neighborhood where they

21:27.019 --> 21:27.720
perfected it.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.488
Right.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.356
Do you remember your first time?

21:29.357 --> 21:30.822
I remember my first time.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.491
How do you feel, first time?

21:32.492 --> 21:34.192
I cried.

21:34.193 --> 21:38.029
And that summer, 15 times, stop

21:38.030 --> 21:39.698
and frisk, thrown up against the

21:39.699 --> 21:43.335
gate, fingers to our genitals
cops looking for gun.

21:43.336 --> 21:46.405
But you remember that, you
remember your first time.

21:46.406 --> 21:49.875
When you lose your stop
and frisk virginity.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.177
I wonder why?

21:52.178 --> 21:56.047
Is it because off CNN show
or it is it just because...

21:56.048 --> 21:57.716
I've been arrested.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.585
If you hang out here long

21:59.586 --> 22:02.220
enough, I can get you
stop and frisked.

22:02.221 --> 22:05.757
They talk about DIY culture,
about do it yourself.

22:05.758 --> 22:08.560
And you better be able to do it

22:08.561 --> 22:09.895
your [ Bleep ] self in the Bronx

22:09.896 --> 22:12.230
because often, nobody sells
going to do it for you.

22:12.231 --> 22:16.902
When you go in the Bronx,
you're going back in time.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.069
There are certain crimes that

22:18.070 --> 22:22.040
will happen here that won't
happen here in Brooklyn or

22:22.041 --> 22:22.308
Manhattan.

22:22.309 --> 22:24.242
Purse snatchers.

22:24.243 --> 22:24.544
Really?

22:24.545 --> 22:25.744
There's still crackheads.

22:25.745 --> 22:26.912
There's crackheads in front

22:26.913 --> 22:28.414
of that over there, and they are

22:28.415 --> 22:29.581
getting their cracks, and

22:29.582 --> 22:31.550
they're not bothering anyone.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.085
And they are respecting
parts of this community.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.588
You see them every day.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.256
There's a crackhead that's
been here for 25 years.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.459
That takes some
determination now.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.729
Listen, if I could be a
crackhead, I would be the best

22:43.730 --> 22:44.431
crackhead possible.

22:44.432 --> 22:48.266
I was a crackhead, and oh
listen, people have been

22:48.267 --> 22:48.468
there.

22:48.469 --> 22:53.439
No judgments.

22:53.440 --> 22:57.609
Hey, what's up?

22:57.610 --> 22:57.977
All right.

22:57.978 --> 23:00.612
Look, I'm thinking curry goat.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.814
His uncle Vernon used to own

23:02.815 --> 23:05.451
this place, but that
was three owners ago.

23:05.452 --> 23:08.319
Now it's lammy's, people put too

23:08.320 --> 23:12.624
much cinnamon in the goat,
which is a sin against god.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.626
Lammy fixed things.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.962
Curry goat and stewed ox tail

23:16.963 --> 23:21.633
with rice and peas, collards,
and yes, Mac and cheese.

23:21.634 --> 23:22.334
I can't resist.

23:22.335 --> 23:25.937
I mean, correct me if I'm
wrong, there's a lot of good

23:25.938 --> 23:26.473
food in the Bronx.

23:26.474 --> 23:27.773
There is, there is.

23:27.774 --> 23:28.974
If people would like you know

23:28.975 --> 23:30.476
get over their bias and come

23:30.477 --> 23:33.111
above 96th street,
they would find out.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.614
I mean if the Bronx were a

23:35.615 --> 23:36.615
neighborhood in Manhattan, sort

23:36.616 --> 23:38.450
of shrunk down, you'd have

23:38.451 --> 23:39.818
hipsters crawling over over.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.152
Oh my god.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.322
If you live in the Bronx it's

23:44.323 --> 23:48.860
not necessarily that you're
going to leave the Bronx.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.830
Why would you go
past 149th street?

23:51.831 --> 23:54.633
So all that, repping my
neighborhood, the ethnic pride

23:54.634 --> 23:56.802
and all that, people
hold on to that.

23:56.803 --> 24:00.338
And that's true of Rylander

24:00.339 --> 24:01.673
Avenue, that sort of stuff.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.374
Even this.

24:02.375 --> 24:04.810
Neighborhood was all
white until the '50s.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.678
It's very recent the
whole immigrant...

24:06.679 --> 24:08.346
Who lived here in the 50s?

24:08.347 --> 24:09.181
All white people.

24:09.182 --> 24:10.682
What kind of white people?

24:10.683 --> 24:11.883
White white.

24:11.884 --> 24:15.020
Like we enjoy milk white, we're

24:15.021 --> 24:16.822
kissing dogs on the mouth.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.024
It's moved forward, and there's

24:19.025 --> 24:20.325
definitely this whole, you know,

24:20.326 --> 24:22.828
like I'm from 233rd, you're from

24:22.829 --> 24:25.497
225th, every ethnic
group has that.

24:25.498 --> 24:26.532
And the next group that will

24:26.533 --> 24:28.534
take over here is definitely

24:28.535 --> 24:30.035
Mexicans, and the thing is, it's

24:30.036 --> 24:31.036
an immigrant neighborhood.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.705
It's not a matter who have owns

24:33.706 --> 24:36.708
it, it's who owns it at
that time and they're next.

24:36.709 --> 24:41.547
I enjoy good case Dee Yas.

24:41.548 --> 24:45.751
We made the good decision
to come to Lamny's today.

24:45.752 --> 24:46.252
Yeah.

24:46.253 --> 24:49.087
Lammy's, I'm here all the time.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.188
I live right there.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.757
I'm always here for the curry

24:51.758 --> 24:53.725
goat, Mac and cheese, you know.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.161
Lammy's don't play, man.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.785
The twos and the fives here

25:19.786 --> 25:21.252
are the greatest trains because

25:21.253 --> 25:22.754
they go from Bronx through

25:22.755 --> 25:24.590
Manhattan all the way
through Brooklyn.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.592
It's the only number of lines

25:26.593 --> 25:29.728
that will get three
boroughs visibility.

25:29.729 --> 25:30.563
The Bronx still here.

25:30.564 --> 25:31.930
Yeah, it's still here.

25:31.931 --> 25:36.134
But you know, like even that, I

25:36.135 --> 25:39.905
mean that brings me
back, Tony, that sound.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.973
Do you remember the first

25:41.974 --> 25:43.909
time you put spray
paint on a wall?

25:43.910 --> 25:44.577
Yeah.

25:44.578 --> 25:48.146
When was that?

25:48.147 --> 25:50.582
Uh, summer of '70.

25:50.583 --> 25:53.652
Back then, seemingly overnight,
they were everywhere,

25:53.653 --> 25:55.253
princes of the city, their

25:55.254 --> 25:56.955
pieces stretching across city

25:56.956 --> 26:00.091
blocks, whole trains, evermore

26:00.092 --> 26:04.095
audacious, some, by
this man, were artists.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.631
In the late '70s, to be on of

26:05.632 --> 26:07.498
a rooftop like this with a brew

26:07.499 --> 26:09.500
or whatever, hanging out, we're

26:09.501 --> 26:10.501
waiting for something to come

26:10.502 --> 26:11.670
through with a cool letter or

26:11.671 --> 26:14.172
like oh my god, look at that.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.141
And kids are screaming, like, oh

26:16.142 --> 26:18.109
my god, look, here it comes.

26:18.110 --> 26:18.845
There's my mine.

26:18.846 --> 26:20.679
There's mine, but what if you

26:20.680 --> 26:22.480
thought the train was
on the left side.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.315
Then you kind of messed up.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.317
Oh no, it's on the right side.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.353
And no, you're not screwed, you

26:28.354 --> 26:32.123
wait until this train goes all

26:32.124 --> 26:32.992
the way to Brooklyn
and comes back.

26:32.993 --> 26:35.360
This was the audience
you had in mind?

26:35.361 --> 26:35.995
Does matter?

26:35.996 --> 26:38.496
I think all of us spoke
to each other back then.

26:38.497 --> 26:39.965
Other arts.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.499
It was just the rush of the

26:41.500 --> 26:43.334
event, and then the accolades

26:43.335 --> 26:44.870
you may or may not receive.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.972
Not from the public,
but from your peers.

26:46.973 --> 26:52.678
Futura 2000, his style
spread across the globe.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.846
I miss those trains.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.014
Others, not so much.

26:56.015 --> 26:59.651
I get it, it went on and on

26:59.652 --> 27:01.152
until it seemed there wasn't an

27:01.153 --> 27:02.688
untagged, unmarked, bit of wall

27:02.689 --> 27:04.690
or window in New York, but for a

27:04.691 --> 27:06.992
while, it was a golden time.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.194
Well the whole point
of being here... yeah.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.829
Was to me what the Bronx was

27:10.830 --> 27:12.363
about, not just the music and

27:12.364 --> 27:14.332
the scene and coming up with the

27:14.333 --> 27:17.235
parties of Bam and Herc and

27:17.236 --> 27:19.838
everyone of that era, but
it's watching trains.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.339
We used to call it benching.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.874
You were watching work go by?

27:22.875 --> 27:24.743
Absolutely.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.411
Art lovers.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.713
This was his museum.

27:27.714 --> 27:30.048
Where he and his fellow artists

27:30.049 --> 27:31.382
would meet and exchange ideas

27:31.383 --> 27:33.384
and admire each other's work.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.186
And it's jarring coming to learn

27:35.187 --> 27:36.554
all those years later that it

27:36.555 --> 27:39.190
was really all about this, about

27:39.191 --> 27:41.192
a few seconds as their pieces

27:41.193 --> 27:43.929
rode by to be
evaluated by peers.

27:43.930 --> 27:47.365
There for a moment, then gone.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.734
Like well all of their work from

27:48.735 --> 27:52.070
that time, long since
removed or painted over.

27:52.071 --> 27:56.374
Ultimately, the legacy...
Here, here's our legacy.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.209
We don't have a
movement anymore.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.277
The movement has been
given to the world.

27:59.278 --> 28:07.278
And if you go to trains in Milan

28:08.120 --> 28:08.755
and Paris, certainly not the

28:08.756 --> 28:10.221
Russian system, but if you go

28:10.222 --> 28:11.957
around the world,
they're bombed.

28:11.958 --> 28:15.326
Their rail systems
are destroyed.

28:15.327 --> 28:19.430
But I mean, today, if I could
have a train running...

28:19.431 --> 28:20.232
It would be nice.

28:20.233 --> 28:22.768
It would be epic.

28:22.769 --> 28:24.135
I think any artist, Picasso,

28:24.136 --> 28:25.937
if that concept was available,

28:25.938 --> 28:27.739
like here is some public art

28:27.740 --> 28:35.740
guys, threat run through
our countryside.

28:46.158 --> 28:54.158
♪

29:01.340 --> 29:09.340
Take the six trains to the ♪

29:22.361 --> 29:25.496
take the six trains to the

29:25.497 --> 29:27.498
end of the line, then do the

29:27.499 --> 29:30.668
same for the number 29 bus.

29:30.669 --> 29:33.171
Technically you'll still be in

29:33.172 --> 29:40.478
the Bronx, but it kind
of won't feel like it.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.648
City island is a fishing
village turned what?

29:43.649 --> 29:44.682
A parking lot for pleasure

29:44.683 --> 29:46.517
boats, and a long established

29:46.518 --> 29:48.987
restaurant row for new yorkers.

29:48.988 --> 29:52.824
Pick the perfect day
to come out here.

29:52.825 --> 29:57.028
Desus says this place, and
Desus is always right.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.529
How far from the
neighborhood by car?

29:58.530 --> 30:00.331
Maybe 15, 20 minutes.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.167
20 minutes.

30:01.168 --> 30:04.169
That seems like a world away.

30:04.170 --> 30:08.039
Yeah, but I want to buy
some nautical stuff.

30:08.040 --> 30:08.875
This is New York City?

30:08.876 --> 30:11.176
This is Cape Cod in the Bronx.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.378
Many of my childhood memories,

30:13.379 --> 30:15.180
get there and they're like oh

30:15.181 --> 30:17.382
the beach is closed
far medical race.

30:17.383 --> 30:18.917
It's not a day you go in the

30:18.918 --> 30:23.021
water and come out with like
a maxi pad stuck to you.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.023
Been there.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.791
So you were here like
when, yesterday?

30:26.792 --> 30:28.726
I was literally here yesterday.

30:28.727 --> 30:30.695
Wow.

30:30.696 --> 30:31.297
For my sister's graduation

30:31.298 --> 30:33.098
because every time you have an

30:33.099 --> 30:34.900
event of note in the Bronx, you

30:34.901 --> 30:36.201
have to come celebrate
at city island.

30:36.202 --> 30:39.270
I notice all the big
catering halls.

30:39.271 --> 30:42.908
Yeah, get married, arraigned,

30:42.909 --> 30:44.409
baby's not yours, come here.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.912
Seashore restaurant, a
massive fish factory on the

30:46.913 --> 30:48.947
water of a type I'm very

30:48.948 --> 30:51.216
familiar with, having started my

30:51.217 --> 30:54.385
cooking career in
one just like it.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.221
I'm also a sentimental fool, and

30:56.222 --> 30:58.924
I love this kind of thing.

30:58.925 --> 31:01.826
Steamers, a true
taste of childhood.

31:01.827 --> 31:04.262
Boiled striper and some snow

31:04.263 --> 31:08.099
crab and a nice cold beer,
yes, thank you, Desus.

31:08.100 --> 31:12.237
It's like a knighting ceremony.

31:12.238 --> 31:15.640
Just kind of sit up, and
like oh, take it all in.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.109
Enjoy guys.

31:18.110 --> 31:18.477
Thank you.

31:18.478 --> 31:20.811
I could have done
that myself, but...

31:20.812 --> 31:22.113
That's part of it.

31:22.114 --> 31:27.085
Part of the ambience.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.586
This is the perfect place far

31:28.587 --> 31:30.956
date, but it's the
worst food for a date.

31:30.957 --> 31:34.025
Either a huge turnoff
or a huge turnon.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.261
You might give a lady a preview

31:36.262 --> 31:38.296
of what they're
about to get into.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.099
All the little bib,
little sucking action.

31:41.100 --> 31:48.173
Just let them know, in an
hour, this could be you.

31:48.174 --> 31:48.975
Wow.

31:48.976 --> 31:50.841
This is pretty awesome.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.443
Saturday night, city island,

31:52.444 --> 31:53.845
that's where people are going.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.788
The first European settler

32:03.789 --> 32:07.158
to come to the Bronx
came in 1639.

32:07.159 --> 32:10.962
His name was Jonas Bronck.

32:10.963 --> 32:14.732
In 1874, all the area west of

32:14.733 --> 32:16.467
the Bronx river was the city and

32:16.468 --> 32:18.469
in 1895, all the area east of

32:18.470 --> 32:20.138
the Bronx river was the city,

32:20.139 --> 32:22.173
and 1898, the city decided that

32:22.174 --> 32:24.909
the two areas previously inexed

32:24.910 --> 32:27.145
should also become a borough.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.480
But what to call it since
it never had a name before?

32:29.481 --> 32:31.649
They looked at the map and right

32:31.650 --> 32:33.651
smack to the middle of the

32:33.652 --> 32:34.819
territory ran the Bronx river,

32:34.820 --> 32:37.188
so they named it after the

32:37.189 --> 32:39.257
river, the borough of the Bronx,

32:39.258 --> 32:41.592
and that is why it is called the

32:41.593 --> 32:46.497
Bronx and not just plain Bronx.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.833
If off question about the

32:48.834 --> 32:55.173
Bronx, chances are Lloyd
Alton has the answer.

32:55.174 --> 32:57.208
Born and raised here, he's never

32:57.209 --> 33:03.781
really left for
over seven decades.

33:03.782 --> 33:07.518
This is a disappearing
aspect of New York for sure.

33:07.519 --> 33:11.122
The real thing Jewish deli,
it is one of the last.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.524
There used to be dozens of

33:13.525 --> 33:14.859
places where you can get your

33:14.860 --> 33:20.631
police cut, pastrami,
pickles with soda to drink.

33:20.632 --> 33:25.536
The world series is going
on, Howard is on the air.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.472
Suddenly you see a tongue of

33:27.473 --> 33:30.708
flame licking up into the sky.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.711
And he says, this is the kind of

33:33.712 --> 33:36.481
thing that Jimmy taught us all,

33:36.482 --> 33:39.217
ladies and gentlemen,
the Bronx is burning.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.252
The old image of the Bronx as

33:41.253 --> 33:43.221
middle class, mobile, healthy

33:43.222 --> 33:46.724
area had survived up until
1977, this shattered it.

33:46.725 --> 33:47.725
Right.

33:47.726 --> 33:52.663
The Bronx was burning with
the story, and that stuck.

33:52.664 --> 33:53.565
Politicians making the south

33:53.566 --> 33:55.400
Bronx a poster child for what

33:55.401 --> 33:57.568
was hopelessly wrong, would

33:57.569 --> 33:59.170
always be wrong, would never, we

33:59.171 --> 34:02.507
were told, get any better.

34:02.508 --> 34:06.844
So we now have what you call
a slum lord essentially.

34:06.845 --> 34:08.579
Snapping up large
numbers of buildings.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.681
First of all, he takes out a

34:11.683 --> 34:12.850
huge fire insurance policy.

34:12.851 --> 34:17.188
So as he goes to the junkies and

34:17.188 --> 34:20.358
says listen, you see that
apartment on the top floor?

34:20.359 --> 34:22.260
I'm going to turn my back.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.462
You take all of the lead pipes

34:24.463 --> 34:26.297
that are in there, but I have

34:26.297 --> 34:29.934
one request, please, before you

34:29.935 --> 34:34.705
leave, turn on the
water, and the

34:34.706 --> 34:38.643
they then hire an arsonist and

34:38.643 --> 34:39.944
sets fire to the building, they

34:39.945 --> 34:41.312
collect all the money,
and they leave.

34:41.313 --> 34:42.313
I remember it well.

34:42.313 --> 34:43.215
I remember those years.

34:43.216 --> 34:47.152
Things were bad.

34:47.152 --> 34:50.455
Are things boroughwide,
are they getting better?

34:50.456 --> 34:52.290
Is the Bronx better?

34:52.291 --> 34:52.591
Absolutely.

34:52.592 --> 34:55.226
There is more home ownership in

34:55.226 --> 34:56.627
the south Bronx than had
ever existed in history.

34:56.628 --> 35:00.131
That doesn't mean that
we've reached utopia.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.867
How long it will take,
I'm a historian.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.635
I look in the other direction.

35:04.636 --> 35:10.074
I would say my crystal
ball is cracked.

35:10.075 --> 35:12.243
I got four cheeseburgers.

35:12.244 --> 35:14.645
Is it the best hamburger
in the world?

35:14.646 --> 35:18.316
Far from it, my friends.

35:18.317 --> 35:21.018
Is it even, strictly
speaking, a burger?

35:21.019 --> 35:23.354
I mean, it's small and
square and steamed.

35:23.355 --> 35:24.422
It can be, especially when you

35:24.423 --> 35:26.324
eat a lot of them, as one tends

35:26.325 --> 35:30.761
to, a hate yourself in
the morning experience.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.197
But if you grew up with white

35:32.198 --> 35:35.333
castle like I did and like

35:35.334 --> 35:37.368
handsome dick Manitoba did, this

35:37.369 --> 35:41.172
connects with some deep dinosaur

35:41.173 --> 35:45.443
part of the brain, evoking
an emotional response.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.178
This is a big part
of my childhood.

35:47.179 --> 35:50.181
We'd come here 24 hours a day.

35:50.182 --> 35:50.816
There were guys on their dates.

35:50.817 --> 35:52.049
There was a bunch
of punk rock kids.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.851
So along with that potpourri of

35:53.852 --> 35:56.187
humanity I just described you

35:56.188 --> 35:59.190
had these guys from the
mental institution.

35:59.191 --> 36:00.391
Ah, that's community for you.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.626
That was the Bronx.

36:01.627 --> 36:04.229
That was the Bronx, man.

36:04.230 --> 36:04.696
It was great.

36:04.697 --> 36:06.397
Maybe you know handsome dick

36:06.398 --> 36:10.235
from such prepunk legendary
bands as the dictators.

36:10.236 --> 36:12.570
Dick grew up, where else, the

36:12.571 --> 36:14.239
Athens, the cultural guyser, the

36:14.240 --> 36:17.975
font of art and music
that is the Bronx.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.310
And back in the day like me,

36:19.311 --> 36:22.580
this was his special
warm and happy place.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.715
I can go by and eat a full

36:24.716 --> 36:29.420
2 1/2-hour meal, be stuffed, and

36:29.421 --> 36:32.056
see someone eating a white
castle, I stilt want one.

36:32.057 --> 36:34.225
You can forget Mickey D’s.

36:34.226 --> 36:35.660
You forget burger king.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.228
You fork all those places.

36:37.229 --> 36:40.398
If you need a white castle
scratch, none of the cheap

36:40.399 --> 36:41.732
places will do.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.370
I can't stop eating.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.003
The Bronx academy of letters

37:19.004 --> 37:20.838
is something of a cause for me.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.673
An institution whose mission I

37:22.674 --> 37:25.042
see as absolutely vital.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.811
If kids like these kids from a

37:26.812 --> 37:28.346
tough neighborhood, often coming

37:28.347 --> 37:31.181
from tough family situations,

37:31.182 --> 37:32.017
are going to dot things that

37:32.018 --> 37:34.652
they're capable of, of
having the things they want.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.153
I believe that there is no way

37:36.154 --> 37:38.523
to realize your dreams if you

37:38.524 --> 37:39.690
can't articulate them, if you

37:39.691 --> 37:41.359
can't with words convince others

37:41.360 --> 37:43.060
to give you the opportunities,

37:43.061 --> 37:46.664
the chances you need to grasp.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.366
So I wanted to talk today...

37:48.367 --> 37:50.701
Really I'm going to tell you
in a short period of time

37:50.702 --> 37:53.070
everything I know about writing.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.539
Today I'm dropping by in my

37:54.540 --> 37:59.377
role as substitute teacher.

37:59.378 --> 37:59.878
I'm from Manhattan.

37:59.879 --> 38:02.413
And I don't know anything
about the Bronx really.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.615
I'm ridiculously,
shamefully ignorant.

38:04.616 --> 38:05.384
Do you think people know about

38:05.385 --> 38:08.886
the Bronx, what it's like
to grow up in the Bronx?

38:08.887 --> 38:10.721
Everybody perceives the Bronx

38:10.722 --> 38:13.858
as the emergence of hip-hop
and all that, the culture.

38:13.859 --> 38:17.227
But apart from that the Bronx is

38:17.228 --> 38:17.829
actually lively at all times.

38:17.830 --> 38:19.229
At night, in the morning.

38:19.230 --> 38:23.568
You hear people screaming
from outside your window.

38:23.569 --> 38:26.404
Since I was like 7.

38:26.405 --> 38:29.740
And it's happened that way.

38:29.741 --> 38:30.709
Community's the biggest thing.

38:30.710 --> 38:31.909
I've been teaching here for

38:31.910 --> 38:33.077
eight years, and I think that

38:33.078 --> 38:34.244
what people forget is a lot of

38:34.245 --> 38:35.446
times we talk about this in

38:35.447 --> 38:38.749
class, they focus on lots of

38:38.750 --> 38:41.318
diseases, health issues,
lack of education.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.887
But I can be out with them just

38:42.888 --> 38:44.254
walking to the train to go to a

38:44.255 --> 38:47.792
field trip and they say
hi to at least 30 people.

38:47.793 --> 38:50.595
They know everyone.

38:50.596 --> 38:52.062
What other Bronx specialties

38:52.063 --> 38:54.732
should I be paying attention to?

38:54.733 --> 38:58.436
Montano's.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.271
That works for you.

39:01.272 --> 39:02.107
Yeah.

39:02.108 --> 39:05.042
I like bacon, egg and
cheese sandwich.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.276
That's a classic.

39:06.277 --> 39:10.415
That's a New York classic.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.782
Sort of a bodega classic.

39:11.783 --> 39:12.317
Love that.

39:12.318 --> 39:16.286
I walk outside and
have the Italian icee.

39:16.287 --> 39:17.788
Soon as the weather gets nice

39:17.789 --> 39:22.292
and you hear cohito,
they've got the best.

39:22.293 --> 39:25.796
What is chopped cheese?

39:25.797 --> 39:27.932
I have to see.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.800
Where does this come from?

39:29.801 --> 39:31.469
This mutant cheese.

39:31.470 --> 39:37.975
This thing, whatever it
is, it'll do just fine.

39:37.976 --> 39:41.979
As long as you're reading
Orwell's essays while you're

39:41.980 --> 39:42.814
eating it, kid.

39:42.815 --> 39:46.183
I think it's someone who
experiments in their home.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.184
Because it tastes so different

39:47.185 --> 39:48.653
than like a cheeseburger, which

39:48.654 --> 39:51.321
is what it kind of is actually.

39:51.322 --> 39:54.792
But it's... people uptown or

39:54.793 --> 39:56.160
like downtown say chopped cheese

39:56.161 --> 39:58.328
and they're like, what?

39:58.329 --> 40:00.998
Here you're like...
So this is a regional

40:00.999 --> 40:01.533
indigenous special.

40:01.534 --> 40:03.501
And it's newer, too, right?

40:03.502 --> 40:05.335
It hasn't been around that long.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.336
I've been everywhere in the

40:06.337 --> 40:07.672
world, and I mean just about

40:07.673 --> 40:10.340
everywhere in the world
that you can think of.

40:10.341 --> 40:14.645
As beautiful as many cities
around the world are, it's

40:14.646 --> 40:16.647
really in your blood,
particularly if you grew up

40:16.648 --> 40:17.015
here.

40:17.016 --> 40:19.349
You're living in Paris, you

40:19.350 --> 40:21.018
don't want a chopped
cheese sandwich.

40:21.019 --> 40:29.019
You'll be angry you
that can't get one.

40:31.029 --> 40:31.830
So there it is.

40:31.831 --> 40:34.364
A peek, a narrow slice of an

40:34.365 --> 40:38.002
old, deep, and noble subject.

40:38.003 --> 40:41.205
♪ Causing the co-existence

40:41.206 --> 40:42.206
♪ to morph into a
relentless illogical ♪

40:42.207 --> 40:43.874
sitting right there,
relatively unexplored.

40:43.875 --> 40:46.711
A cross-section of the
tasty, original good stuff.

40:46.712 --> 40:50.581

The great unknown.

40:52.885 --> 40:55.252
Go look.

40:55.253 --> 40:57.888

40:57.889 --> 40:59.858
