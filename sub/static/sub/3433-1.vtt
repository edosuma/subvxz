00:54.459 --> 00:55.846
Julian Assange was right.

00:59.825 --> 01:02.728
Noam Chomsky was right.
Dan Brown was right.

01:04.726 --> 01:08.657
So were all the anonymous gangs and

01:08.658 --> 01:11.593
Bilderberger freaks. They were spot on.

01:12.593 --> 01:17.494
So were Kim DotCom and the
Twin Tower tinfoil crowd,

01:18.493 --> 01:20.795
the Wikileaks, Wikipedia

01:21.794 --> 01:25.728
and all the other fucking wikis

01:26.727 --> 01:29.728
and open sources of the net.

01:30.727 --> 01:33.761
Except for the Nibiru teams. Nibiru were

01:34.760 --> 01:36.062
a pile of horseshit.

01:37.061 --> 01:40.329
But anyway they're all dead now,
dead and forgotten,

01:41.328 --> 01:43.493
and the world's another place.

01:43.494 --> 01:46.226
The Illuminati and the rating agencies

01:46.227 --> 01:50.961
grabbed all the power, and those countries
that didn't join the Confederation

01:50.962 --> 01:52.760
were bankrupted

01:52.761 --> 01:55.629
and decimated with peace missions

01:56.628 --> 02:00.933
and in the end filled
with radioactive waste.

02:04.929 --> 02:05.928
The masses,

02:06.762 --> 02:09.763
with their cubicle jobs and their families,

02:10.762 --> 02:12.261
their monthly installments.

02:13.761 --> 02:15.463
Well, it's obvious,

02:16.462 --> 02:18.998
it's never easy to open people's eyes.

02:20.996 --> 02:22.607
Now we're the only ones left.

02:23.830 --> 02:25.471
Still putting up the fight.

02:34.463 --> 02:36.662
GreenWar here.

02:36.663 --> 02:37.763
Sponge talking.

02:45.964 --> 02:47.576
Are you there, Ryan? Over.

03:15.132 --> 03:16.131
Argh!

03:17.932 --> 03:19.579
Son of a bitch!

03:32.566 --> 03:34.566
Still no answer from Ryan.

03:35.566 --> 03:38.397
More than three hours have
elapsed since the launch.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.132
Yesterday,
one of our satellites went haywire

03:45.133 --> 03:47.354
and crashed into a contaminated quadrant.

03:49.234 --> 03:51.288
Our satellites are ex-government issue

03:52.067 --> 03:56.567
that had been pirated away from the
Confederation's control by our hackers

03:56.568 --> 03:59.900
and reconverted into mobile
nodes for communication among

03:59.901 --> 04:03.235
the cells of the organization.

04:04.234 --> 04:08.267
Usually, such use can't last
more than five or six days.

04:08.268 --> 04:09.268
Argh!

04:09.835 --> 04:12.499
The time it takes the
government's technicians to

04:12.500 --> 04:16.132
crack the numerical
sequences of the viruses.

04:16.134 --> 04:17.766
- But at that point...
- Argh!

04:17.767 --> 04:21.434
...our malware causes the
satellites to self-destruct

04:21.435 --> 04:25.169
and permanently cancel all the
data transferred by them...

04:28.803 --> 04:33.013
...to avoid leaving the government
any useful evidence of our missions.

04:44.002 --> 04:45.279
How you doing, Captain?

05:05.638 --> 05:07.239
File 2556,

05:09.237 --> 05:10.638
November, 2047.

05:11.637 --> 05:13.306
This is Captain Ryan Willburn.

05:14.305 --> 05:19.173
I've landed somewhere inside
of contaminated quadrant B2.

05:20.172 --> 05:23.306
Well outside the intended targeted impact.

05:24.905 --> 05:27.503
My transmitter isn't working,
so I can't communicate,

05:27.504 --> 05:29.447
and most of my equipment is damaged.

05:30.938 --> 05:32.381
I'm banged up pretty good.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.505
As far as supplies go,

05:36.505 --> 05:39.447
I have some freeze-dried food,
some flash bangers, and

05:41.838 --> 05:46.909
unfortunately,
an insufficient supply of antirad.

05:48.907 --> 05:51.423
But I will complete my mission.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.353
File 2557,

09:30.351 --> 09:32.349
I'm looking at a pile of bodies here.

09:34.416 --> 09:35.919
All dead.

09:36.918 --> 09:38.652
There must be several hundred.

09:39.651 --> 09:43.359
It stinks.
It's like a mountain of human corpses.

09:51.351 --> 09:52.906
My God, what have they done?

10:12.519 --> 10:14.023
Where are you?

10:25.286 --> 10:26.962
Damn it!

11:06.021 --> 11:07.593
Wait just one second.

11:22.457 --> 11:24.233
I am not here to hurt you, okay?

11:24.689 --> 11:28.189
I am Captain Ryan Willburn.

11:28.190 --> 11:30.989
- I am here to help you.
- Yah!

11:30.990 --> 11:33.091
Argh!

11:35.090 --> 11:36.558
Hold on a second.

11:37.557 --> 11:41.166
I'm here with the Organization
fighting against the Confederation.

11:43.590 --> 11:45.190
I'm not going to hurt you.

11:46.290 --> 11:50.124
No. It's just an alarm.
It's okay. It's an alarm.

11:51.123 --> 11:54.427
I have to take some medicine, okay?

12:34.526 --> 12:35.914
I gotta take the antirad.

12:37.293 --> 12:40.612
This radiation is frying my frickin' brain.

12:59.594 --> 13:00.816
Did you bring me here?

13:04.462 --> 13:05.973
Can you understand me?

13:50.930 --> 13:53.702
It's an old,
burnt-out military command center.

13:58.697 --> 14:01.029
But I'm not even sure if you understand me.

14:03.597 --> 14:06.538
What's your name? My name is Ryan. You?

14:14.530 --> 14:15.633
Tuag.

14:17.631 --> 14:20.684
Good. Are there more like you?
Are there more survivors?

14:22.143 --> 14:24.529
There's things I need
to figure out as well,

14:24.530 --> 14:27.195
because I don't know how
long I can survive here.

14:29.598 --> 14:31.600
Antirad. Where did you get this?

14:32.599 --> 14:35.010
This is exactly what I need.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.609
Military communications base.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.332
Okay.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.600
Eenie, meenie, minie...

15:05.866 --> 15:07.335
...Moe.

15:09.333 --> 15:10.887
You've got to be kidding me.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.555
We got power, Tuag.

15:20.034 --> 15:23.933
If I can just figure out how to put
these video phones back together,

15:23.934 --> 15:28.333
then we can prove to the whole
international community what happened here,

15:28.334 --> 15:29.500
but I need your help.

15:30.335 --> 15:31.334
Okay?

15:32.201 --> 15:33.503
You help me.

15:35.425 --> 15:38.034
The capture and control
of government satellites

15:38.035 --> 15:39.967
is part of GreenWar's M.O.

15:39.968 --> 15:44.837
Control of government.

15:45.836 --> 15:48.535
And their attempted recovery
by the Confederation

15:48.536 --> 15:52.271
and subsequent self-destruction are,
therefore, routine.

15:54.269 --> 15:55.768
But this time is different.

15:58.204 --> 16:01.036
The satellite fell before
the government technicians

16:01.037 --> 16:03.436
could set off our
self-destruct protections,

16:04.435 --> 16:08.535
and so there's no guarantee that
the card containing our top secret

16:08.536 --> 16:10.777
data wasn't permanently canceled.

16:17.771 --> 16:20.004
If this should be the case,

16:20.005 --> 16:22.614
the organization would
be seriously compromised.

16:23.205 --> 16:27.869
Ryan's mission is to find the remains
of the satellite and, if necessary,

16:27.870 --> 16:32.541
make sure that all the incriminating
data is completely canceled.

16:35.538 --> 16:39.049
But now, I don't care about the satellite.

16:50.039 --> 16:51.343
I'm worried about him.

16:56.338 --> 16:59.640
This is Captain Ryan Willburn,
member of GreenWar.

17:00.639 --> 17:02.873
This is an S.O.S.

17:03.872 --> 17:05.540
My radio has been damaged.

17:07.538 --> 17:11.480
I do not want to reveal my coordinates
out of concern for my own safety.

17:14.107 --> 17:18.659
I need this message to be relayed to all
the cells that it might reach my superior.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.507
I need to be evacuated.

17:23.506 --> 17:26.276
This is Captain Ryan Willburn,
member of GreenWar.

17:28.273 --> 17:29.641
Stop it.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.806
- Who is this monkey?
- A rebel, sir. Ryan Willburn.

17:33.807 --> 17:38.507
I know him, Colonel.
He's one of Sponge's more enthusiastic men.

17:38.508 --> 17:42.674
- Sponge?
- Yes, sir. Sponge. Nickname.

17:42.675 --> 17:46.284
- Top man at GreenWar.
- GreenWar. - GreenWar is a terrorist front.

17:47.874 --> 17:49.107
What else is there?

17:49.108 --> 17:52.275
Rumor has it that he raised the boy.
He adopted him.

17:53.274 --> 17:59.208
Has this area been a theater of
operations in the last six months?

17:59.209 --> 18:01.985
Yes. We've recently operated
in that quadrant, sir.

18:02.976 --> 18:07.641
- Was it classified?
- As a Q5, sir. - A rebalancing mission, sir.

18:07.642 --> 18:09.640
- Who was in charge?
- You were, sir.

18:10.276 --> 18:12.111
I was. Oh.

18:13.110 --> 18:14.619
Well, good work. Dismissed.

18:24.343 --> 18:26.675
Shall I organize the operational unit, sir?

18:26.676 --> 18:29.875
As soon as I'm through, I'll join you
for the briefing with the Chief of Staff.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.142
It shouldn't take me that long.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.809
I postponed the briefing.

18:33.810 --> 18:35.920
We have to get on our way, immediately.

18:37.845 --> 18:40.477
Forgive me, Colonel,
but I don't see the need.

18:40.478 --> 18:43.609
Wouldn't it be safer to send
in special forces or drones?

18:43.610 --> 18:46.047
We act and then we talk later.

18:47.923 --> 18:49.311
The Chief of Staff and...

18:49.312 --> 18:52.712
The Chief of Staff has
bird shit for brains.

18:53.711 --> 18:55.050
Sit down.

19:00.045 --> 19:03.043
Your dad, you remind me of him,
and when I look at you,

19:03.812 --> 19:07.115
I still see his lovely teenage daughter.

19:09.113 --> 19:11.445
Hell, we could've been together, you and I.

19:13.013 --> 19:16.348
Well, you're on my team now,
so let's get this shit rolling.

19:19.345 --> 19:22.448
As you wish, Colonel.
I'll get it organized at once.

19:24.446 --> 19:25.684
Major.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.554
Good girl.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.433
So that it might reach my superior.

19:43.313 --> 19:45.312
I need to be evacuated.

19:45.313 --> 19:49.613
This is Captain Ryan Willburn,
member of GreenWar.

19:49.614 --> 19:52.849
This is Captain Ryan Willburn,
member of GreenWar.

19:53.848 --> 19:56.848
This is an S.O.S. My
radio has been damaged.

20:34.683 --> 20:36.148
Lobo.

20:36.149 --> 20:38.615
I've sent you some X-rays.
Did you get them?

20:38.616 --> 20:40.815
Why are you calling me
here at the pharmacy?

20:40.816 --> 20:44.618
I need some antibiotics
for a nasty abscess.

20:45.438 --> 20:46.549
As soon as possible.

20:46.550 --> 20:49.852
Okay. Well, I'll put
that on the fast track.

20:50.851 --> 20:52.649
No farting around.

20:52.650 --> 20:55.186
ASAP. No farting around.

20:57.184 --> 20:58.183
- Lobo.
- What?

20:59.018 --> 21:01.616
Look at the X-rays again.

21:01.617 --> 21:03.996
Okay. Bye.

21:15.984 --> 21:20.369
Listen. I probably talked too much, all
right? So you're gonna have to kill her.

21:20.985 --> 21:22.762
It's sad, but it has to be done.

21:24.451 --> 21:28.553
Besides, she's really no good at the art,
you know?

21:30.551 --> 21:31.620
Will do.

21:39.319 --> 21:40.318
No!

22:02.954 --> 22:05.223
File 2558.

22:07.221 --> 22:09.623
I was raised to believe in non-violence

22:11.621 --> 22:14.323
and only ever used
violence in self-defense.

22:16.321 --> 22:18.623
Our mission here is to sabotage

22:19.622 --> 22:22.722
and lend assistance to the
victims of the repression

22:23.721 --> 22:27.571
and whenever possible, not to take lives.

22:44.555 --> 22:45.659
Okay.

22:49.655 --> 22:50.829
This should work now.

22:57.822 --> 22:58.821
You see?

23:02.723 --> 23:05.060
This is Willburn. Sponge, you out there?

23:08.058 --> 23:10.124
Sponge, are you out there?

23:10.125 --> 23:12.960
What the hell happened?
What the fuck are you doing?

23:14.958 --> 23:16.224
Let me explain.

23:16.225 --> 23:18.456
Explain what, Ryan?

23:18.457 --> 23:22.356
That your encrypted message from
an old fuckin' video station

23:22.357 --> 23:25.890
that fell off the back of a laughing
dinosaur was heard around the world

23:25.891 --> 23:30.391
and now everyone and his
uncle knows you're there.

23:30.392 --> 23:33.457
It's like you switched on a spotlight,
opened your arms and shouted,

23:33.458 --> 23:34.659
"Here I am, folks!

23:35.658 --> 23:37.691
"Come and get me!"

23:37.692 --> 23:42.025
You know that, don't you?
Now, get your ass out of there.

23:42.026 --> 23:43.025
Listen to me.

23:44.484 --> 23:49.092
I believe I've uncovered something here that
can bring down the whole Confederation.

23:49.291 --> 23:52.228
They have committed mass genocide, but

23:53.227 --> 23:56.059
- there's a survivor.
- I don't like DIY missions.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.946
Did you find the satellite?
Did you destroy the card?

23:59.527 --> 24:02.191
No. Actually I used it
to fix this transmitter,

24:02.192 --> 24:03.958
but I can destroy it right
after this connection.

24:03.959 --> 24:06.680
No, no.
Now, you leave the card right where it is.

24:07.627 --> 24:10.070
We have to remain in
contact for fuck's sake.

24:10.993 --> 24:15.493
I don't care about the satellite,
at least not until you're safe.

24:15.494 --> 24:16.827
So, don't touch it. Okay?

24:17.526 --> 24:21.800
Give me just 10 minutes and I'll organize
your evacuation, and I'll try to see

24:22.661 --> 24:27.587
what the Confederation is cooking up
after your harebrained suicidal plea.

24:53.562 --> 24:55.117
They're already there, Ryan.

24:59.662 --> 25:01.231
It's even Asimov.

25:02.230 --> 25:03.229
Asimov.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.802
That's major trouble.

25:11.797 --> 25:15.162
- Well, let's rock and roll.
- No. No, son. I know him.

25:15.163 --> 25:19.048
There's no half measures with him.
He's buried plenty of kids like you.

25:21.246 --> 25:25.631
Well, maybe it just means that I've figured
something out that he feels exposed,

25:25.831 --> 25:28.662
- or he wouldn't come here personally.
- Fuck, Ryan.

25:29.031 --> 25:33.197
Now, you listen to me.
This is a not a war you can win in a day.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.796
I've learned that the hard way.

25:34.797 --> 25:40.231
First on active duty, and then being locked
up in rat holes like this all on my own.

25:40.232 --> 25:44.030
You don't always have to shoot
an elephant to bring home dinner.

25:44.031 --> 25:46.398
Mass graves are usually blown apart.

25:46.399 --> 25:52.331
If they found one, it's because something
didn't work, or else there's a trap.

25:52.332 --> 25:55.219
It's probably mined like
chocolate chips in a cookie.

25:56.998 --> 26:01.800
One of the things you have to learn to
sacrifice for the common good is heroism.

26:03.798 --> 26:07.400
You have an hour,
so get your ass out of there right now.

26:08.399 --> 26:09.705
Go.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.865
Ryan, do you hear me?

26:18.533 --> 26:20.001
Answer me, you fuck!

26:20.600 --> 26:23.731
Must be something wrong with the
transmitter. You're breaking up, Sponge.

26:23.732 --> 26:27.033
Hey, man,
don't give me that transmitter bullshit.

26:27.034 --> 26:32.466
You get your ass out there and bring back
that fucking card you were sent there for.

26:32.467 --> 26:34.465
Your mission is already accomplished!

26:38.368 --> 26:40.217
I can't do that, Sponge.

26:57.201 --> 26:59.246
Premises secured, Colonel.

27:10.235 --> 27:12.011
Fuck!

27:21.002 --> 27:24.538
- How are you feeling, Major?
- Good, sir.

27:26.536 --> 27:29.678
You two, downstairs. Check the entrance.

27:38.669 --> 27:42.000
Colonel, I think you need to
come up and take a look at this.

27:42.636 --> 27:43.635
Copy that.

27:45.371 --> 27:46.370
- Coogan?
- Sir.

27:47.337 --> 27:49.540
- Aren't you cold?
- No, sir.

27:51.538 --> 27:54.204
Are you not afraid your dick will freeze?

27:55.203 --> 27:57.041
Your fly is open. Can you fix it?

27:59.039 --> 28:00.549
Yes, Colonel.

28:11.539 --> 28:12.547
Yes.

28:20.539 --> 28:23.039
Well, looks like he was expecting us.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.509
Sure. It's supposed to scare us.

28:27.507 --> 28:28.839
That doesn't work on me.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.841
Hell can't be that bad.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.228
At least it's warm there.

28:47.541 --> 28:50.673
Colonel, we have guests.

28:50.674 --> 28:52.191
Ah.

29:42.144 --> 29:44.978
Gentlemen, at ease.

29:45.933 --> 29:48.043
Is that how you appreciate punctuality?

29:48.044 --> 29:49.043
We're friends.

29:50.909 --> 29:55.876
Drop the toy, sweetheart, or I'll shove
it up your ass and use the silencer.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.976
Colonel,
you had a band of mercenaries come here?

29:58.977 --> 30:01.645
Major, we need a map,

30:02.479 --> 30:04.977
and a plan of action.
Can you take care of it?

30:04.978 --> 30:06.044
But Colonel...

30:06.045 --> 30:08.522
No questions asked. Just do it.

30:18.512 --> 30:20.011
How have you been, Colonel?

30:20.812 --> 30:23.713
Well, I'm having a ball.

30:25.711 --> 30:28.546
I don't read. I don't mingle.

30:29.545 --> 30:30.812
I don't like TV.

30:31.812 --> 30:34.698
I keep asking myself,
why do I love this job so much,

30:36.479 --> 30:39.014
and what the hell happened
to bloody romance?

30:40.013 --> 30:42.178
Who is the blonde babe you came in with?

30:42.646 --> 30:46.698
Uh, her dad was a buddy of mine in
Special Forces. He never came back, so.

30:49.179 --> 30:50.349
Are you banging her?

30:52.347 --> 30:54.679
You ever think without your dick?

30:54.680 --> 30:55.679
No.

30:59.580 --> 31:02.548
- Well.
- You've changed, Colonel.

31:03.547 --> 31:07.600
You're gonna tell me we're doing all
this just because of one lousy rebel?

31:08.081 --> 31:11.746
Let's talk outside.

31:11.747 --> 31:14.318
- Whoo.
- A little privacy.

31:18.314 --> 31:19.883
So, Tuag,

31:21.881 --> 31:24.157
you sure you want to go through with this?

32:11.583 --> 32:14.016
Delilah Defense Program operative.

32:14.017 --> 32:18.014
Delilah, recognize and circumscribe
this position by 1,500 square meters.

32:18.884 --> 32:22.352
Recognition and delimitation
of territory executed.

32:24.351 --> 32:26.749
Colonel, Delilah's already operative.

32:26.750 --> 32:29.418
We also scanned the DNA
of the three mercenaries

32:29.419 --> 32:32.285
and inserted their data in
the program along with ours.

32:32.485 --> 32:34.550
This way Delilah can signal
the presence of intruders

32:34.551 --> 32:37.048
within the perimeter without false alarm,
sir.

32:37.251 --> 32:41.551
Yes. And taking advantage of the
area's already high radiation levels,

32:41.552 --> 32:44.586
Delilah can also detect
recent organic traces.

32:45.585 --> 32:48.487
Look what we found. There's blood there,

32:49.486 --> 32:51.321
here, and here as well.

32:53.319 --> 32:56.928
The rebel was wounded, sir,
and he traveled along this trajectory,

32:57.519 --> 33:00.851
but then here, his traces disappear.

33:00.852 --> 33:03.652
Unfortunately,
where there's a lot of cement inside,

33:03.653 --> 33:06.484
detection can be more difficult,
but I've already sent in Greshnov

33:06.485 --> 33:08.852
and Private O'Brien to
inspect the premises.

33:08.853 --> 33:13.485
We've also discovered that the station is
able to transmit with more sophisticated

33:13.486 --> 33:15.818
codes that will be much harder to decipher,

33:16.421 --> 33:19.418
but they were intentionally
ignored by the rebels, sir.

33:22.088 --> 33:24.188
Major, darling, nice work.

33:25.187 --> 33:29.686
- That message was intended for us.
- Don't worry about it.

33:29.687 --> 33:32.424
Lobo and his gang will take care of it.

33:34.422 --> 33:37.653
Stop the car. Yeah. But
Asimov told us to...

33:37.654 --> 33:39.590
Stop the fuckin' car.

33:41.588 --> 33:43.642
So we're not going to burn the bodies?

33:44.922 --> 33:48.423
Jimmy, you get started on that job, okay?

33:49.422 --> 33:52.308
Me and him got something to do.
We'll meet you later.

34:22.524 --> 34:24.158
Almost there, Sergeant.

34:25.157 --> 34:29.523
Copy that, Corporal.
We read you loud and clear. Proceed.

34:29.524 --> 34:31.889
- Is the antirad safe?
- Yes, sir.

34:31.891 --> 34:36.110
It's in the security lockers upstairs
in the recording room. I have the keys.

34:36.757 --> 34:38.525
Give me the keys.

34:39.524 --> 34:42.275
You can get hurt. It's safer.

34:59.259 --> 35:00.647
What the hell's going on?

35:02.158 --> 35:06.326
Human presence detected within the
controlled perimeter, sector A4.

35:07.326 --> 35:08.325
- Willburn.
- Here.

35:09.159 --> 35:11.657
O'Brien, Greshnov, he's close to you.

35:11.658 --> 35:12.657
Copy that, sir.

35:14.125 --> 35:17.789
Human presence detected within the
controlled perimeter, sector A4.

35:19.192 --> 35:23.758
O'Brien, check those walls down there.
I'll go check the vents.

35:23.759 --> 35:25.691
Yes, sir.

35:25.692 --> 35:26.691
Watch out, man.

35:28.993 --> 35:31.679
Don't panic. We've gotten it under control.

35:50.661 --> 35:52.272
Greshnov, what just happened?

35:54.261 --> 35:57.430
- Jano, move in and cover them.
- Yes, sir.

35:59.428 --> 36:02.261
Corporal Jano is on his way to back you up.

36:02.262 --> 36:03.373
There's nobody here.

36:16.862 --> 36:20.064
Hey, man, take another look
and then come help me here.

36:22.062 --> 36:23.062
Over.

36:28.996 --> 36:30.162
O'Brien, you read me?

36:39.164 --> 36:40.545
O'Brien, you read me?

37:05.432 --> 37:09.368
What the hell is going on there?
I heard gunshots. Come in.

37:12.366 --> 37:14.697
That bastard got away, Major.

37:14.698 --> 37:17.501
Major, Jano here.

37:19.499 --> 37:21.275
I reached Greshnov. He's wounded.

37:21.765 --> 37:23.597
We're at war here, Major.

37:23.598 --> 37:26.604
Come on. I'll let you up.

37:32.598 --> 37:35.002
For fuck sakes, Lobo, what's on your mind?

37:37.890 --> 37:41.165
Unless you tell me,
I don't understand jack shit, all right?

37:41.166 --> 37:43.601
I feel lost. Just give me a hint.

37:44.600 --> 37:48.430
The problem is, when I explain
something to you, you don't understand.

37:48.733 --> 37:52.334
You're not exactly the smartest
tool in the shed, are you?

37:53.333 --> 37:55.433
So where are we going?

37:55.434 --> 37:57.669
- Back to the station.
- For what?

37:58.268 --> 38:02.366
Why does the Colonel want to burn up all
those bodies? That's what I'd like to know.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.667
Because he's probably
the one that killed them.

38:04.867 --> 38:06.567
Yeah. So what?

38:06.568 --> 38:08.666
So he wants to get rid of the evidence.

38:08.667 --> 38:09.666
Why?

38:11.601 --> 38:15.376
So what is this, some kind of guessing
game? What the fuck do I know?

38:16.202 --> 38:19.568
Huh? When I get an order, I do it.
End of story.

38:19.569 --> 38:20.845
So why did he call you?

38:21.769 --> 38:22.870
Exactly.

38:24.726 --> 38:26.836
I'm going now. You keep your eyes open.

38:27.036 --> 38:28.035
So, then, Jimmy.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.571
Jano.

38:53.570 --> 38:54.569
Oh, shit.

38:55.669 --> 38:57.404
Hey, buddy.

39:01.570 --> 39:03.608
- One man down.
- Where's Willburn?

39:07.604 --> 39:10.204
Hey, there he is. Down there.

39:10.205 --> 39:11.544
Go get him, boys.

39:17.539 --> 39:19.704
Roger. We're headed for the tunnel.

39:19.705 --> 39:22.071
Greshnov, are you able to carry on?

39:22.072 --> 39:25.037
No problem, Major. That
shot just grazed me.

39:25.038 --> 39:27.738
Active the infrared mode as
soon as you're in the tunnel.

39:27.739 --> 39:28.871
Roger.

39:28.872 --> 39:31.746
All copy. Ready? Go.

39:39.738 --> 39:42.848
Colonel, request permission
to join in with Private Remi.

39:43.840 --> 39:48.574
Major,
are you willing to die for this mission?

39:49.573 --> 39:53.007
Then read my lips. Permission denied.

39:54.006 --> 39:57.408
And stop being so

39:59.406 --> 40:01.044
sexy.

40:11.207 --> 40:12.206
Go.

40:16.075 --> 40:19.672
Sergeant, the instrumentation
doesn't seem to be responding.

40:19.673 --> 40:23.004
It must be the concrete.
Perhaps you're in a fallout shelter.

40:24.575 --> 40:27.184
- You have permission to use your light.
- Roger.

40:40.608 --> 40:42.684
The place is full of barbed wire.

40:50.676 --> 40:52.611
- Don't move!
- Ah!

40:55.742 --> 40:58.512
- What happened?
- Ah!

41:00.110 --> 41:02.409
I'm gonna open this fucking
trap and pull you out.

41:02.410 --> 41:03.941
I don't feel it anymore!

41:03.942 --> 41:06.443
- We can't hear you.
- Come in.

41:06.444 --> 41:08.498
Man on the ground, sir. On the ground.

41:09.577 --> 41:11.711
Corporal Jano is seriously wounded.

41:12.710 --> 41:16.181
The place is trapped.
They look like bear traps.

41:36.511 --> 41:39.678
Bastard! You fucking bastard.

41:40.677 --> 41:45.913
Sergeant, you hear me? The bastard
threw a flashbang. I can't see anymore.

41:46.913 --> 41:49.411
Request permission again to rescue Jano.

41:49.412 --> 41:54.410
Major, I'll go. You stay.
And that's an order.

41:54.411 --> 41:55.544
Argh.

41:55.545 --> 41:59.634
Corporal, proceed.
Use your nightvision. I'm on my way.

42:22.613 --> 42:26.918
Sir, I'm in front of a door.
It seems to be sealed.

42:30.915 --> 42:31.914
I'm going in.

42:52.049 --> 42:54.919
Those, those are bodies.

42:57.916 --> 43:01.351
What'd you expect to see? A rave party?

43:20.716 --> 43:22.249
Poor Jimmy.

43:22.250 --> 43:26.121
It's impossible to recreate the
map because of the explosion.

43:31.116 --> 43:32.115
Oh, my God.

43:35.017 --> 43:37.051
He sends his soldiers to die,

43:38.050 --> 43:42.920
but it was only a diversionary tactic.
He promised to join them,

43:44.918 --> 43:47.361
but he was just sending
them into a massacre,

43:49.351 --> 43:51.251
so there wouldn't be any witnesses.

43:52.250 --> 43:54.454
Now there's no more evidence...

43:57.451 --> 43:58.555
Except you.

44:01.552 --> 44:04.785
Yes, there is, Ryan. And it's everywhere.

44:05.784 --> 44:09.617
Wherever we find destruction,
repression, death,

44:09.618 --> 44:12.553
wherever we find people willing to rebel.

44:13.552 --> 44:15.752
I'm still having that nightmare.

44:15.753 --> 44:19.019
You gotta get out of there right away.

44:19.020 --> 44:22.120
Do you still have any supplies of antirad?

44:23.119 --> 44:24.452
Can I ask you something?

44:25.353 --> 44:26.589
Go ahead, boy.

44:29.586 --> 44:31.418
You brought me up, right?

44:31.419 --> 44:36.086
Yes, son.
I was still young and we grew up together.

44:36.087 --> 44:38.920
We were into old horror flicks.

44:38.921 --> 44:41.721
You were crazy about Freddy Krueger,
remember?

44:42.720 --> 44:44.996
You had a wife and a son back then, right?

44:46.720 --> 44:48.520
Yes, that's right.

44:48.521 --> 44:50.686
But you lost your son on that mission.

44:50.687 --> 44:52.619
But I managed to save you.

44:52.620 --> 44:56.787
Asimov was young once, too,
just on the other side.

44:56.788 --> 44:58.887
What does it matter, him or another.

44:58.888 --> 45:03.389
It's just not the men who matter but
the silent majority who supports them.

45:04.190 --> 45:06.688
Delilah isn't able to
contact Supreme Command.

45:06.689 --> 45:07.757
Try again.

45:08.756 --> 45:12.220
Major, I don't think that's a good idea.

45:12.221 --> 45:15.255
Delilah is unable because this
function has been disabled.

45:15.455 --> 45:19.254
Get away from there, Ryan.
I don't want to lose a son a second time.

45:19.255 --> 45:21.054
Now get your ass out of there.

45:21.055 --> 45:22.855
I'll use the old station upstairs.

45:22.856 --> 45:27.389
Major, this is an undercover operation,
don't you get it?

45:27.390 --> 45:31.189
There's no news going out
before we finish the operation.

45:31.190 --> 45:33.888
I'm sorry, sir, but no.

45:33.889 --> 45:35.555
I have to complete my mission.

45:35.556 --> 45:37.556
Why the fuck do you have to?

45:37.557 --> 45:41.023
Because of everything you taught me,
Sponge, that's why!

45:41.024 --> 45:45.722
In consideration of the facts, I am under
an obligation to inform Supreme Command,

45:45.723 --> 45:48.557
first to ask for reinforcements,
and secondly,

45:48.558 --> 45:51.623
to investigate all those corpses.

45:51.624 --> 45:56.358
Don't you understand?
That's exactly what scares me.

45:57.357 --> 46:00.889
Major, darling,
I'm afraid you've just been suspended.

46:00.890 --> 46:02.457
Don't you fucking touch me.

46:02.458 --> 46:05.023
Then I'll be responsible again.

46:05.024 --> 46:08.363
Asimov's going to kill you, too.

46:18.524 --> 46:19.967
Move.

46:27.959 --> 46:31.566
- Do we have a problem?
- I think more than one, maybe.

46:37.560 --> 46:40.281
You knew about that goddamn satellite,
didn't you?

46:48.594 --> 46:49.936
You cut your hand.

46:59.927 --> 47:00.926
Why?

47:40.596 --> 47:42.196
What are you doing?

47:42.197 --> 47:43.473
You're out of the game.

47:46.352 --> 47:48.128
You want to play a riddle, girl?

47:48.129 --> 47:49.637
Maybe.

47:56.630 --> 47:59.572
I haven't played doctor in a long time,
you know that?

48:02.297 --> 48:07.299
I could have yesterday, but Lobo told me
to kill her instead, the son of a bitch.

48:08.298 --> 48:09.963
Who bangs you at headquarters?

48:10.231 --> 48:13.799
That lying, backstabbing Colonel?

48:14.798 --> 48:15.797
Poor Jimmy.

48:17.530 --> 48:22.063
Now, I'm going to pass you
some private information.

48:22.064 --> 48:24.629
Private information, liquid style.

48:24.630 --> 48:26.601
Fuck you!

49:03.566 --> 49:04.677
Christ, the antirad.

49:05.600 --> 49:10.134
How is it possible that anyone
could get in and steal our antirad?

49:11.133 --> 49:13.699
You never see the damn pacifists,

49:13.700 --> 49:16.533
but they're here amongst
us in the woodwork.

49:16.534 --> 49:19.268
GreenWar is a charity organization.

49:20.267 --> 49:22.401
That's where terrorists hide,

49:23.400 --> 49:26.867
and I bet my life Willburn is no charity.

49:26.868 --> 49:28.811
It wasn't Willburn who came in here.

49:30.534 --> 49:31.601
What's that, Major?

49:31.602 --> 49:34.602
It wasn't Willburn who came in here.
It was a girl.

49:35.601 --> 49:39.735
Don't ask me how.
She came in and stole the antirad,

49:40.704 --> 49:42.869
while this fucker was trying to rape me.

49:43.069 --> 49:44.734
That's a load of crap, Colonel.

49:44.735 --> 49:48.537
I was a bit rough on you before.
You weren't wrong altogether.

49:50.535 --> 49:52.404
So, what kind of girl?

49:54.402 --> 49:55.790
She looked like a native.

49:57.368 --> 50:00.602
She had body paint, and she's skinny.

50:00.603 --> 50:03.536
How is it possible that
Delilah didn't stop her?

50:04.535 --> 50:08.537
Delilah detects living beings
through a magnetic field.

50:09.537 --> 50:12.802
It's possible the paint acted
like some kind of a shield.

50:12.803 --> 50:18.536
Oh, Colonel, request permission to
report this to the Confederation.

50:18.537 --> 50:19.536
Request denied.

50:21.105 --> 50:25.536
Take the lady to the infirmary and
make sure that no one disturbs her.

50:25.537 --> 50:26.602
Yes, sir.

50:26.603 --> 50:30.272
Colonel. Colonel, this is unconscionable.

50:31.271 --> 50:33.437
I will file a report.

50:33.438 --> 50:36.703
I fucking promise you I
will file a fucking report!

50:36.704 --> 50:38.306
You need a rest.

50:40.304 --> 50:41.303
Sergeant...

50:43.106 --> 50:46.637
how long do we have without antirad?

50:46.638 --> 50:48.603
After the first three hours,

50:48.604 --> 50:52.108
we begin to feel the first effects
and the first hallucinations.

50:54.106 --> 50:58.640
Then within the next three to four hours,
we go into a coma, sir.

51:00.638 --> 51:02.026
We have our own supplies.

51:03.972 --> 51:07.709
No kidding. You.

51:11.705 --> 51:16.638
If you want to live longer,
you better keep your hands to yourself.

51:16.639 --> 51:21.877
I'm cool. I'm cool. I said I'm cool. Fine.

51:24.874 --> 51:25.873
Fuck!

51:34.640 --> 51:35.639
Enlarge.

51:46.373 --> 51:47.373
Willburn.

51:49.941 --> 51:54.712
I know you can hear me. Willburn!

51:57.709 --> 51:58.710
Asimov.

51:59.709 --> 52:03.542
You and your girlfriend were very clever,
all right?

52:04.541 --> 52:07.308
But where do you go from here?

52:07.309 --> 52:09.975
Increase contrast.

52:09.976 --> 52:13.741
If you're gonna be hiding and waiting,

52:13.742 --> 52:15.580
you'll go crazy in the process.

52:18.577 --> 52:21.609
In the end,
there's only man who can survive,

52:21.610 --> 52:25.145
goddamn you or goddamn me.

52:26.144 --> 52:29.541
I have a proposal to make, an exchange,

52:29.542 --> 52:31.976
face-to-face, man-to-man.

52:31.977 --> 52:34.580
Think about it and let me know.

52:37.577 --> 52:39.980
I'll be very patient.

52:42.978 --> 52:44.619
Oh, shit.

52:53.611 --> 52:55.812
Did you miss me?

52:56.811 --> 52:59.243
Just tell me what's on your mind.

52:59.244 --> 53:01.810
Why didn't you throw Blondie
in the tunnel right away?

53:01.811 --> 53:04.244
She'd be dead already and we
wouldn't have to worry about it now.

53:04.245 --> 53:05.578
There'd be no more fuss.

53:07.445 --> 53:11.781
Turned into an abscess, you know, the girl,
the daughter of your, your buddy.

53:13.380 --> 53:15.045
It's like a bad toothache, now,

53:15.046 --> 53:18.155
like a rotting tooth in my fuckin'
head with three roots.

53:18.912 --> 53:20.581
Yeah.

53:21.580 --> 53:23.781
Get the girl. I need her.

53:24.780 --> 53:28.414
If Willburn shows up,
he might enjoy the conversation.

53:29.413 --> 53:31.611
Why the hell would he?

53:31.612 --> 53:33.547
When we want to die,

53:34.546 --> 53:38.647
we want to do the best, don't we?

53:39.646 --> 53:43.653
That's what friends are for... Colonel.

53:49.647 --> 53:51.250
I'm not sure.

53:53.248 --> 53:57.879
File 2559. Strange mission.

53:57.880 --> 54:01.616
I feel like I've been here forever,

54:03.614 --> 54:05.882
that my whole life collapsed here,

54:06.881 --> 54:09.580
in the middle of these ruins.

54:09.581 --> 54:12.549
Here he is, sir. He's approaching.

54:13.548 --> 54:17.417
In this air,
saturated with cesium and plutonium,

54:18.416 --> 54:20.614
haunted by ghosts...

54:20.615 --> 54:23.748
And then I've lost my future

54:23.749 --> 54:26.321
and have already gone beyond.

54:31.317 --> 54:34.717
I have a detonator connected to a bottle.

54:35.716 --> 54:39.648
If you shoot me, then you'll
destroy the last supply of antirad.

54:39.649 --> 54:41.821
- I've got him, sir.
- Lower your weapons.

54:45.817 --> 54:47.652
Hell, Willburn.

54:50.649 --> 54:51.648
Here we are.

54:53.218 --> 54:55.219
Colonel Asimov in the flesh.

54:57.217 --> 55:01.269
I've only just learned about you from
news reports and stories I've heard.

55:02.051 --> 55:05.650
I like to keep a low profile.

55:05.651 --> 55:07.651
You seem like a different man now.

55:08.650 --> 55:11.320
And you sound like a fortune cookie.

55:13.318 --> 55:17.285
And that sounds like the morality
of a well-trained guard dog.

55:18.284 --> 55:20.718
Is that what you spew

55:20.719 --> 55:23.955
to your victims before you
just dump them in mass graves,

55:25.953 --> 55:29.587
like some kind of death lullaby?

55:30.586 --> 55:33.552
You must be a psychic visionary.

55:34.551 --> 55:38.653
All over the world, you leave destruction.

55:39.652 --> 55:42.555
Piles of dead bones everywhere.

55:44.553 --> 55:46.607
And now they're screaming for justice.

55:48.587 --> 55:50.222
Screaming for revenge.

55:52.220 --> 55:56.653
Why don't you detonate
the bomb and stop talking?

55:57.652 --> 56:02.288
Let's look at the future.
I don't give a rat's ass about your ideas.

56:03.287 --> 56:05.087
One phone call,

56:06.086 --> 56:08.652
and a container full of antirad will be

56:08.653 --> 56:11.621
airdropped in a heartbeat right here.

56:12.620 --> 56:15.722
So then, why don't you make that call,
Colonel?

56:16.721 --> 56:21.923
This is a phantom operation, and I
want to keep it that way. You know it.

56:23.922 --> 56:26.623
What if I take you to the antirad?

56:27.622 --> 56:30.590
In exchange,
you give me your Jeep and you let me go.

56:32.588 --> 56:34.824
I think I have a... A better proposal.

56:36.822 --> 56:38.556
Lobo.

56:39.555 --> 56:45.832
Your antirad supply, your life, and...
What's her name?

56:55.822 --> 56:57.423
Tuag.

56:57.424 --> 57:00.489
My men will escort you to your supply,

57:00.490 --> 57:03.626
and then you stay with us.

57:05.624 --> 57:07.724
You're not going anywhere.

57:08.723 --> 57:12.553
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to see
that you let her go with my own eyes.

57:13.756 --> 57:16.633
I'm calling the shots now.

57:26.624 --> 57:29.659
2039 to 2041.

57:31.657 --> 57:35.566
Correlate. Search archive.

57:43.559 --> 57:44.961
Yes.

57:47.959 --> 57:49.664
That's it.

57:54.659 --> 57:56.658
Ryan, listen to me.

57:56.659 --> 57:57.799
One second.

58:04.793 --> 58:07.659
So, are you gonna let her go, or what?

58:07.660 --> 58:09.764
Shut up. Keep walking.

58:13.760 --> 58:18.326
Okay, boy. Heaven help us all.
I'll do all the talking.

58:18.327 --> 58:20.627
In those images you bounced to me, well,

58:20.628 --> 58:24.159
I did a little searching, and I read a guy.

58:24.160 --> 58:29.294
He's part of a team of
mercenaries led by a certain Lobo.

58:30.293 --> 58:32.996
In fact, this Lobo was once on our side,

58:33.995 --> 58:37.437
but then he was caught and shipped
off to one of their prisons.

58:37.661 --> 58:42.130
After a while, Lobo cut a deal
and spilled everything he knew.

58:43.129 --> 58:48.094
Asimov almost managed to dismantle
the whole organization thanks to him,

58:48.095 --> 58:49.630
and then he set him free.

58:50.629 --> 58:55.560
Since then, for all this time,
he's been at Asimov's beck and call.

58:55.561 --> 58:58.429
A long time, way too long.

58:58.430 --> 59:02.995
With all he knows, it's very strange that
Asimov hasn't got rid of him already.

59:02.996 --> 59:05.664
I hope this little dirt
can be useful to you.

59:07.662 --> 59:08.661
Good luck, my boy.

59:24.498 --> 59:26.163
Okay. So, where's the antirad?

59:27.096 --> 59:28.163
It's over there.

59:28.164 --> 59:30.838
What are you sitting around for? Go get it.

59:38.487 --> 59:40.597
It's in the barrel, you want to get it?

59:40.598 --> 59:42.301
No. You get it, you dumb fuck

59:45.298 --> 59:46.297
No problem.

59:58.599 --> 01:00:00.899
Open it. Let me see.

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:02.897
Nice and slow.

01:00:06.733 --> 01:00:09.435
Whoo!

01:00:12.432 --> 01:00:13.934
- Lobo?
- Yeah.

01:00:15.932 --> 01:00:17.930
What do you say you and I cut a deal?

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.602
A deal?

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.274
All right.

01:00:31.267 --> 01:00:33.850
That's my deal. Put that back in there.

01:00:50.834 --> 01:00:52.833
Asimov wants us both dead.

01:00:52.834 --> 01:00:53.945
I already know that.

01:00:58.502 --> 01:01:02.423
Good boy!
You just earned yourself a wind-up toy.

01:01:23.403 --> 01:01:25.638
Any chance we can still make a deal?

01:01:26.637 --> 01:01:28.136
You know what that is?

01:01:28.137 --> 01:01:30.335
I already know what I want from you, buddy.

01:01:30.336 --> 01:01:31.638
Sleepy time.

01:02:05.606 --> 01:02:08.404
I couldn't find a damn thing.

01:02:08.405 --> 01:02:12.070
That transmitter must be very
deep there in the cortex.

01:02:12.071 --> 01:02:13.626
So, what are we going to do?

01:02:14.571 --> 01:02:19.974
Well, we could calmly dig it out once
we get out of here to a place of safety.

01:02:20.973 --> 01:02:23.804
Willburn might have destroyed the data.

01:02:23.805 --> 01:02:27.238
Well, I doubt it.
Why would he ruin his insurance policy?

01:02:27.239 --> 01:02:31.239
We can't leave until we get what we want.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.771
Sergeant, what's wrong with you?

01:02:33.772 --> 01:02:35.739
It's as if the antirad had no effect, sir.

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.972
Get your ass to the infirmary,
get an extra shot.

01:02:39.973 --> 01:02:41.674
We want you alive.

01:02:43.672 --> 01:02:45.748
Yes, of course, Colonel.

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:55.739
Sip it.

01:03:22.642 --> 01:03:24.863
We got ourselves into some real bad shit.

01:03:27.775 --> 01:03:31.513
We should have never come here on our own.
For fuck's sake!

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:35.777
I'm dying, aren't I?

01:03:37.775 --> 01:03:40.575
I don't know, Sergeant.
Everything is so strange.

01:03:40.576 --> 01:03:43.475
I don't think the antirad
is working anymore.

01:03:43.476 --> 01:03:46.774
There's some other toxin in the air.

01:03:46.775 --> 01:03:48.985
My, my head is spinning.

01:03:56.978 --> 01:04:01.612
Set yourself free and get me some morphine,
Major.

01:04:02.611 --> 01:04:04.156
Please. Please.

01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:17.617
Sergeant.

01:04:22.612 --> 01:04:24.256
Sergeant, where is it?

01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:38.082
No. Stay away from me!

01:04:41.079 --> 01:04:43.447
Major, it's here with us.

01:04:45.446 --> 01:04:46.577
Don't you see it?

01:04:46.578 --> 01:04:49.180
No. It's just you and me.

01:04:50.179 --> 01:04:51.813
It's whispering something.

01:04:51.814 --> 01:04:55.616
Oh, God! There!

01:04:58.613 --> 01:04:59.645
Get away from me.

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:01.756
There's nothing there. There's nothing.

01:05:04.679 --> 01:05:06.413
Stay away from me!

01:05:06.414 --> 01:05:07.919
Coogan.

01:05:13.914 --> 01:05:14.980
No.

01:05:14.981 --> 01:05:18.639
- What are you doing?
- No! No! No!

01:05:42.616 --> 01:05:47.152
Tuag. You've got to get away from here.

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:53.452
But I don't want to run away.
I want to kill them all.

01:05:56.449 --> 01:05:57.448
You can talk.

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:03.151
I can do many things.
Haven't you understood all ready?

01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:07.084
Your imagination can do anything.

01:06:08.083 --> 01:06:13.451
Think of all the innocents that you
failed to save and then think of me.

01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:16.615
What are you doing? What are you saying?

01:06:17.183 --> 01:06:21.521
We're one and the same.
You want me, don't you, Ryan?

01:06:25.517 --> 01:06:26.942
Help us.

01:06:51.918 --> 01:06:54.252
Oh, I don't know.

01:06:54.253 --> 01:06:55.519
It doesn't matter what you do.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.117
Can you not wake him up?
I need him talking.

01:06:58.118 --> 01:07:00.519
Give him a dose of dopaxatrine.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.918
That shit can wake up dead people.

01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:04.651
Yeah. Let's do it.

01:07:04.652 --> 01:07:05.851
Go get it.

01:07:05.852 --> 01:07:06.851
Right away.

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.652
Oh, he's heard us.

01:07:13.653 --> 01:07:15.689
Hey. Hey, sweetie.

01:07:19.586 --> 01:07:22.624
Good morning. Good evening.

01:07:25.621 --> 01:07:27.786
We need to speed things up a little bit.

01:07:30.521 --> 01:07:32.453
A barbecue just for you.

01:07:32.454 --> 01:07:35.690
The satellite's data card. Any ideas?

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:42.790
Lobo thinks that you
uploaded it in your head.

01:07:44.788 --> 01:07:47.789
I don't believe that. You ready?

01:07:49.787 --> 01:07:52.623
Coogan's dead, and the bitch ran away.

01:07:53.622 --> 01:07:58.956
Lobo, get the bitch's
ass back in here soon.

01:07:59.955 --> 01:08:03.423
I certainly will.
I'll give her a spanking for you.

01:08:05.421 --> 01:08:07.622
All that high-tech talk

01:08:07.623 --> 01:08:11.655
about uploading information
into people's heads.

01:08:11.656 --> 01:08:13.360
I don't believe it.

01:08:17.356 --> 01:08:18.587
No!

01:08:18.589 --> 01:08:23.758
- Ready?
- Asimov, no! Don't! Stop!

01:08:25.756 --> 01:08:26.755
The data card.

01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:46.256
No? Again?

01:08:46.258 --> 01:08:49.758
No! No, no, no, no! Asimov, no!

01:08:50.756 --> 01:08:53.859
That's enough! I'll tell you!

01:08:55.858 --> 01:08:57.765
That's enough! Stop!

01:09:04.758 --> 01:09:05.756
Major?

01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:10.926
Major?

01:09:11.925 --> 01:09:14.760
Major, darling. You like that better?

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.694
The data card, I need it.

01:09:19.693 --> 01:09:21.625
It's in the transmitter.

01:09:21.626 --> 01:09:25.693
I miss you. I'd like for you to come out.

01:09:26.692 --> 01:09:29.694
At least come out and
play for a little while.

01:09:30.693 --> 01:09:34.527
Honey, look, I,
I got to have a conversation with you

01:09:34.528 --> 01:09:36.304
about the future, you understand?

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.792
Thank you. Of course.

01:09:44.794 --> 01:09:47.492
No. Wait! No, don't do it!

01:09:47.493 --> 01:09:48.626
Good boy.

01:09:48.627 --> 01:09:52.760
Asimov, no. Don't! No!

01:09:52.761 --> 01:09:54.632
Tuag!

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:03.594
You can trust me. I believe in God.
Anything's possible.

01:10:03.595 --> 01:10:07.661
You know, honey, you really ought to
think about what you're doing because

01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:10.294
there's a lot of things you don't know.

01:10:10.295 --> 01:10:14.660
Like, for instance, you think your
father was pals with the Colonel.

01:10:14.661 --> 01:10:18.094
It wasn't like that.
He wanted to do away with him.

01:10:18.095 --> 01:10:23.628
Wanted to get rid of him. So now that
everything's crystal clear, honey,

01:10:23.629 --> 01:10:27.630
please come out and play with me,
your friend.

01:10:28.629 --> 01:10:32.497
I'm Lobo. Right?

01:10:33.496 --> 01:10:36.631
Everybody likes Lobo, even you.

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:41.633
Come on, honey. It's the right thing to do.

01:10:43.631 --> 01:10:46.331
You bastard! Why?

01:10:48.329 --> 01:10:50.666
She had nothing to do with this.

01:10:52.664 --> 01:10:55.668
It doesn't matter. Here.

01:10:59.665 --> 01:11:04.667
You just saved a lot of people.

01:11:40.633 --> 01:11:43.634
I thought you were coming out. Come on.

01:11:48.299 --> 01:11:51.532
It's okay, now. Everything's all right.

01:11:51.533 --> 01:11:54.635
I can feel it. Come on, honey.

01:11:55.634 --> 01:11:57.370
Come on.

01:11:59.368 --> 01:12:03.266
Honey, please come out and play with me,

01:12:03.267 --> 01:12:04.704
your friend.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:12.281
You lied. I'm so disappointed.

01:12:24.269 --> 01:12:26.316
Don't take it too badly, asshole.

01:12:40.303 --> 01:12:41.302
You're an asshole.

01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:51.256
When you end up in hell,
you can shag your little bitch again.

01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:00.203
You're a lousy shot too.

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:04.805
Got a light?

01:13:05.804 --> 01:13:09.044
Smoking kills.

01:13:16.037 --> 01:13:17.036
Tuag!

01:13:17.971 --> 01:13:20.643
What the fuck?

01:13:58.607 --> 01:13:59.674
Sorry, darling.

01:14:32.642 --> 01:14:35.840
Can I have an update on Kim Jong?

01:14:35.841 --> 01:14:38.208
Satellite Kim Jong Un the seventh

01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:41.008
will be orbiting directly
over this quadrant in

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:43.677
exactly 15 minutes and 35 seconds.

01:14:45.675 --> 01:14:48.778
Get me an S.O.S., if it gets there.

01:14:50.776 --> 01:14:53.846
Message encrypted and
ready for transmission.

01:14:57.842 --> 01:15:03.479
The world is so amazing and so crazy.

01:15:06.476 --> 01:15:10.611
The human race slowly
moves into final waltz.

01:15:12.609 --> 01:15:16.679
Being a soldier is... crazy enough.

01:15:18.677 --> 01:15:23.188
I kill every day, and I'm not a criminal.

01:15:34.178 --> 01:15:35.177
That's crazy.

01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:38.479
Ryan.

01:15:39.478 --> 01:15:41.810
Cut me loose. We gotta help Tuag now.

01:15:41.811 --> 01:15:42.710
It's not real.

01:15:42.711 --> 01:15:44.812
I just saw her with my own eyes.

01:15:45.411 --> 01:15:48.377
- I'll cut you out of here fast.
- They just killed her.

01:15:48.378 --> 01:15:50.478
She came back to life and took him out.

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:53.044
She does not exist, Ryan.

01:15:53.045 --> 01:15:55.544
The antirad isn't working anymore.

01:15:55.545 --> 01:15:57.610
I took an alpha-blocker,
I stopped hallucinating.

01:15:57.611 --> 01:16:00.645
Wait a second. What's happening to me?

01:16:00.646 --> 01:16:04.186
Listen to me. We've got to get of here now.

01:16:11.179 --> 01:16:14.549
Once upon a time, she deserted him.

01:16:16.547 --> 01:16:17.713
Oh.

01:16:18.712 --> 01:16:22.048
I figured you would,
but it's a little disappointing.

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:28.493
Cute. Very cute.

01:16:41.481 --> 01:16:42.647
You killed my father.

01:16:43.549 --> 01:16:46.157
It was an accident. We screwed up.

01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:56.448
You're a monster.

01:16:57.447 --> 01:16:58.747
Thank you, darling.

01:18:03.685 --> 01:18:04.954
It's over, Asimov.

01:18:06.952 --> 01:18:08.291
Ah!

01:18:14.285 --> 01:18:17.225
No more bullets. Ho-ho.

01:18:23.219 --> 01:18:24.218
Where are you?

01:18:26.519 --> 01:18:28.922
Show me your face.

01:19:04.888 --> 01:19:07.688
Have you ever heard the
whispers of the dead?

01:19:07.689 --> 01:19:09.626
Ryan, go! Go!

01:19:14.621 --> 01:19:16.626
Heal the suffering.

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:24.357
We can't go. We have to save Tuag.
We have to take her with us.

01:19:26.355 --> 01:19:28.954
Son of a bitch.

01:19:28.955 --> 01:19:30.658
She's the only survivor!

01:19:32.656 --> 01:19:36.821
Don't leave me. I need you.

01:19:36.822 --> 01:19:40.796
Ryan, don't you see? She's not there.

01:19:47.789 --> 01:19:52.464
You're supposed to be dead, bitch.

01:20:00.456 --> 01:20:01.573
Come on!

01:20:16.559 --> 01:20:17.567
Argh!

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.637
Get down. Stay down.

01:20:39.625 --> 01:20:40.624
Get down.

01:22:31.865 --> 01:22:38.531
Scrooge was right. Ron Hubbard was right.
Charles Manson was right.

01:22:38.532 --> 01:22:41.132
The Viagra folks were right,

01:22:41.133 --> 01:22:44.731
and so were the people
behind the Club Mediterranee.

01:22:44.732 --> 01:22:46.967
Sponge, it's me. Can you hear me?

01:22:48.965 --> 01:22:50.898
My boy, you're alive!

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:51.898
I think so.

01:22:52.365 --> 01:22:56.131
That's a damn good start.
It's good enough for me, boy.

01:22:56.132 --> 01:22:58.665
I'm heading east,
but I don't know for how long.

01:22:58.666 --> 01:23:00.887
Oh, the east is crawling with anarchists.

01:23:01.365 --> 01:23:03.968
So they're still our friends, right?

01:23:04.967 --> 01:23:07.301
This fucking world makes no sense.

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.831
One big stinking mess.

01:23:10.832 --> 01:23:13.637
It's hard, really hard,
to know who's right.

01:23:16.634 --> 01:23:18.034
All right.

01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:19.811
Okay. I'll see you soon.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.633
File 2560 Mission Data.

01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:38.401
This is Captain Ryan Willburn.
I'm on my way back home now.

01:23:42.968 --> 01:23:47.302
I'll pass through the eastern border
instead of waiting to be evacuated.

01:23:47.303 --> 01:23:49.234
My mission was successfully accomplished,

01:23:49.235 --> 01:23:55.035
but I'm unable to explain what precisely
happened in contaminated quadrant B2,

01:23:55.036 --> 01:23:57.734
nor my length of time that I spent there.

01:23:57.735 --> 01:24:01.969
I can't say if the hallucinations I
experienced were actual hallucinations.

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:05.136
I'm not convinced of it,
or if the surviving girl I met

01:24:05.137 --> 01:24:09.068
and received help from
was merely an illusion,

01:24:09.069 --> 01:24:13.010
or a corrupted figment of my paranoia.

01:24:20.004 --> 01:24:22.206
There is one thing I can say for sure,

01:24:23.205 --> 01:24:26.063
or perhaps even shout if I need to.
