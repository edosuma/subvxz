To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

of my friends at 8. TA R. Labs,

00:13.264 --> 00:16.381
I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.507
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

00:18.728 --> 00:22.220
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

Don't let him take me back there.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.204
killed Deathstorrn for hurting a speedster,

02:53.382 --> 02:56.340
but then he left Killer Frost alive
and then took off with Bany.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.761

Looks like he cares even less about me
than you do, Hany.

by accident. Did he follow you here?

your father's still alive

you might have to.

Zoom has my daughter and our Bany,
and we need to rescue them both.

11:28.856 --> 11:33.441
Look, I wanna ﬁnd Zoom just as much as
anybody, but no one can track him.

11:33.819 --> 11:36.731
The only person who would know
where he would be hiding someone

11:39.408 --> 11:41.740
nmnnmmm:

11:41.910 --> 11:46.870
Yeah, maybe, but Zoom kept her alive
yesterday because she always obeys him.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.577
There's no way
that she's gonna tell you where he is.

11:49.751 --> 11:50.786
I'm not so sure about that.

11:50.961 --> 11:54.203
If she loved Deathstorrn
as much as my Caitlin loved Ronnie,

11:54.381 --> 11:57.544
I think she'd be more than upset
at Zoom for killing him.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.752
Look, ﬁnding her is gonna be just as hard
as ﬁnding Zoom.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.386
But if anyone can do it,

12:08.145 --> 12:09.385
my husband can.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.935
Right. Yes, I can actually.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.223
Um...

12:15.652 --> 12:16.903
All right.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.101
(SCATTING)

12:20.032 --> 12:22.739
Okay, well, looks like Patty Spivot
was the CSI tech

12:22.910 --> 12:26.073
on most of the Killer Frost cases.
She's pretty thorough, so-

12:26.288 --> 12:27.368
WWW]

12:27.623 --> 12:30.911
Oh, this is Killer Frost meta-data
collected from numerous crime scenes.

12:31.084 --> 12:35.498
DNA trace movements, facial recognition,
temperature ﬂuctuations speciﬁc to her.

12:36.048 --> 12:39.415
My algorithm compiles all the data
and gives us an approximate location.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.050
It works on most metas,
except for Zoom of course.

12:42.220 --> 12:45.257
-He's too fast, never leaves a trace.
-That's good.

12:45.474 --> 12:49.012
ALLEN: Okay. Looks like the best bet's
the woodlands.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.889
-Best CSI in Central City.
-No.

12:52.064 --> 12:54.180
-You know where that is, right?
-Yeah. Let's go.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.231
Wait, I'm going with you guys.
You're gonna need some help.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.938
-Okay.
-lris.

12:59.112 --> 13:03.355
Bany, Zoom and his followers
are the reason that my father is dead.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.991
If I can stop him from killing
anyone else, I'm gonna try.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.409
-Okay, then I'm coming, too.
-HARRISON AND CISCO: No.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.542
Bany, this is not what you do.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.838
I know that, but...

13:20.592 --> 13:24.460
I also know Joseph didn't like me
too much, but he was my father-in-Iaw.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.551
If you're going, I am coming with you.

13:32.437 --> 13:36.521
All right. You can come,
but you stay out of our way.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.149
Okay.

13:44.533 --> 13:45.693
EU :1 EX'ZIIITTmlmH

13:48.578 --> 13:52.070
I know he's trying to tell us something.
We just have to ﬁnd the pattern.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.421
There's no pattern, Bany.

14:06.096 --> 14:07.381
You know your dad,

14:07.556 --> 14:12.016
who I'm pretty sure is one of the smartest
people to live on either of our Earths,

14:12.185 --> 14:16.804
told me the only person smarter than him
was you.

14:19.443 --> 14:20.558

14:22.738 --> 14:26.026
If that's true, we work together,

14:26.867 --> 14:28.823

He never goes past ﬁve knocks

15:04.446 --> 15:05.526
Yeah, you're right.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.818
nmmmmm

15:14.664 --> 15:17.531
It's a ﬁve-by-ﬁve tap code used by POWs.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.951
That would only get us to 25 letters,
and there's 26 in the alphabet.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.666
No, not if you combine C and K.
They sound the same.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.798
Let's try it out.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.629
-Worth a shot.
-All right.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.306
-There it is.
-It looks different than before.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.013
That's because I realized that
there was a ﬂaw with Velocity-Eight,

15:41.191 --> 15:44.308
so I reformulated
the extracellular matrix and...

15:44.528 --> 15:45.768
Velocity-Nine.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.364
You know what they say.
Ninth time's the charm.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.190
Hey, Iris. You okay?

15:52.702 --> 15:55.409

about the time.

15:55.914 --> 15:59.406
Well, don't wony. TheY'll make it back

about something else.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.045
Oh, yeah, sure, what is it?

16:06.216 --> 16:10.880
Well, my new editor (CHUCKLES)
wants me to write a scathing article

16:11.096 --> 16:15.135
on the Flash not being able to protect
Central City from Geomanoer.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.432
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:18.061 --> 16:22.270
I was hoping
to write an article about you instead.

16:23.024 --> 16:26.391
Something that would calm people
until Bany got back.

16:27.070 --> 16:30.187
You know, Iris,
I don't know if that's the best idea.

16:30.407 --> 16:35.197
Well, I think that if people knew that
there was someone that could protect them,

16:35.745 --> 16:36.871
it would really help.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.238
Would you just think about it?

to be honest.

18:20.350 --> 18:23.387

Looks like your Velocity-Nina's a winner.

even for somebody
with a heart as cold as yours.

that would make me turn on Zoom?

it doesn't work like that over here.
