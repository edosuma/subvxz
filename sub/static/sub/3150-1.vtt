This is starting to be too much for me.
Derek, just because you marry ...

14:13.751 --> 14:17.088

What the hell do you mean by that?

14:17.338 --> 14:20.842

16:20.219 --> 16:25.099

16:25.433 --> 16:31.105
It's not about trust. we let
them chilling bit before we turn to.

16:31.481 --> 16:36.778
Wrong. This I do. I bid
them drinks, then it is resolved.

16:37.112 --> 16:41.074
How do you know that they will be checked?
All girls want it.

Was not that Marilyn Monroe?
Fun that you noticed it.

17:00.929 --> 17:06.977
Too late. No chance tonight.
That is what happens when you lose focus.

17:07.853 --> 17:11.941

20:39.745 --> 20:44.542
Look how hard they try.
And it would keep idiots gone.

20:50.215 --> 20:53.552
Why are they like that?

OMG, I'm so envious of
tits yours. Mitchie, they are not nice?

22:52.428 --> 22:55.557
It's not my thing, cutie.
Interest objectively.

22:55.807 --> 22:58.727

22:58.977 --> 23:01.605
Good point. Know them.

23:36.350 --> 23:38.352
You are perfect.
No.

23:38.602 --> 23:40.563
What is happening?

23:49.197 --> 23:53.034
Sienna? Thank you.
Why?

23:53.118 --> 23:56.872
For that you went with this.
You were clearly against it ...

23:57.915 --> 24:00.793
... But we have to have fun.
I just want Casey to have fun.

24:46.008 --> 24:48.010

24:49.428 --> 24:51.639

24:52.890 --> 24:55.601

Nice to meet you, Derek. will

26:38.544 --> 26:42.090
He's just a little shy.
Providence, give my friend ...

26:42.340 --> 26:45.927

26:51.516 --> 26:54.937
When he comes back,
has metamorphosis his begun.

26:58.982 --> 27:02.319
I wonder how it goes
Mitch up there with the ladies.

27:07.158 --> 27:09.911
Too much dick there.

27:14.290 --> 27:19.755
Enjoy it.
I have so much fun!

27:24.176 --> 27:27.346
So what do you want me to do?

27:27.638 --> 27:31.559
What you normally do?

28:04.094 --> 28:09.015
Like my body?
You are fighting beautiful, yes.

28:21.028 --> 28:23.072
I can not do this.

28:25.199 --> 28:28.786
Let me guess, a stag?
Excuse me.

28:30.455 --> 28:34.709
You are an alright kid.
She must be awesome.

28:36.253 --> 28:42.301
Here, purchase a drink and make
to give your friends a thumbs up, okay?

28:45.179 --> 28:47.348
Thank you.

28:51.310 --> 28:57.359
OMG ... That there is too much dick.

28:58.276 --> 29:00.904
I want a drink.
I'm going with.

29:04.992 --> 29:06.952
Thank you.

29:07.536 --> 29:10.831
We go and look at her.
She has huge breasts.

29:14.794 --> 29:20.842
I'm here, but thanks anyway.
Come on, Casey. Let's have fun.

29:23.261 --> 29:26.932
I have,
but I need a little sausage break.

29:27.224 --> 29:30.435
Can we stop calling it that?

29:31.937 --> 29:36.150
Come on, it's your big night.
Yeah, that's it.

29:39.237 --> 29:42.407
See, that's Derek. Derek!

29:43.866 --> 29:49.915
Perfect, I'm sitting here and talking with
him while having fun so we'll see next.

29:50.499 --> 29:53.210
Okay.
Cheers.

30:01.260 --> 30:04.263
Shit.
Damn cardboard call.

30:05.723 --> 30:08.017
You are angry because
Thunder dicks, what?

30:09.018 --> 30:12.439
Let me buy you a drink.
No thanks, you've done enough.

30:15.317 --> 30:17.402
Or not.

30:34.128 --> 30:38.174
Seaman, you can fix a drink?
Yes, Captain.

30:38.466 --> 30:43.346
Vodka with tranebÃ¦rsjus.
Can you be more stereotypical?

30:43.680 --> 30:47.851
Excuse?
A gay ordering vodka cranberry?

30:48.102 --> 30:52.398
But ... I'm not gay.
That's the point.

30:52.690 --> 30:56.694
I do not understand.
I do it to approach girls.

30:56.986 --> 31:00.865
So they use me
as a kind of sexually project.

31:01.157 --> 31:05.745
A sexprosjekt? Wow.
You are a real idiot.

31:06.079 --> 31:12.127
Yes, one can question it.
A gray area, but layers drink now.

31:12.586 --> 31:17.383
For your information, I like
whiskey with water, and I'm gay.

31:18.259 --> 31:21.888
No, I'm sorry. I did not mean ...
No, of course not.

31:22.180 --> 31:25.475
I'm not homophobic or anything.
Why I got that impression?

31:25.767 --> 31:28.603
I have many friends gays
hanging in my home.

31:28.853 --> 31:33.024
Is that true?
Good, then I make your drink, okay?

31:51.002 --> 31:54.422
Be careful, they are properly strong.
I like them strong.

31:55.507 --> 31:58.426
Can you keep up with this?
Excuse me.

31:58.677 --> 32:00.929
Thank you.

32:01.596 --> 32:05.267
It's wet my pants now.
Morn, buddy.

32:07.728 --> 32:11.816
Who are the lucky type?
Derek.

32:12.149 --> 32:17.405
There are rumors that he is busy.
You can not get him.

32:17.697 --> 32:20.867
What is it? Vodka cranberry? Cult.

32:25.497 --> 32:30.919
So it was Mitchell, what?
Yes, we met earlier.

32:31.795 --> 32:35.841
Exactly. What the two of ...

32:36.133 --> 32:41.472
... goes out, pull some fresh air
and talk a little.

32:43.516 --> 32:45.977
Yeah ... no.

32:46.061 --> 32:49.856
Another time?
Maybe, I guess.

32:50.148 --> 32:54.903
You are a bit close.
I can get closer.

32:55.237 --> 33:00.034
I do, baby. Where should he?
Okay, this does not feel so good.

33:00.367 --> 33:04.121
Good, another time then.
Another time ...

33:05.873 --> 33:08.876
Bartender! Give me a whiskey with water.

33:09.168 --> 33:13.840
I've never been on a
strip club before. Dad was against it.

33:14.132 --> 33:18.553
Here's a wedding present for you.
And where is mine?

33:18.887 --> 33:21.807
It seems as if
I bet all the ladies on drinks?

33:22.057 --> 33:24.393
It's ok, we can share.

33:25.144 --> 33:30.024
No, I am pure from sexual
transmitted diseases and stuff.

33:30.358 --> 33:34.237
I'll go up and look at men
with real balls.

33:36.531 --> 33:40.494
Sexually transmitted diseases?
Not that it matters.

33:40.785 --> 33:45.999
We are engaged.
No, we are not engaged.

33:46.333 --> 33:49.795
I know it,
I just think that you are safe.

33:53.758 --> 33:57.011
One can not be too sure.
Cheers to that.

34:02.058 --> 34:04.769
So tell your husband.
Boslov?

34:05.645 --> 34:08.648
He's a really good guy
when getting to know him.

34:09.775 --> 34:12.610
What does he do?
He is an entrepreneur.

34:12.694 --> 34:16.991
He has some clubs and travel a lot.

34:17.324 --> 34:19.909
He does not like to talk about it.

34:27.918 --> 34:33.007
How did you meet?
On his club a few months ago.

34:33.300 --> 34:37.596
He asked if we wanted to dance
and refused to hear an answer.

34:43.561 --> 34:45.730
You get him next time.

34:45.813 --> 34:49.692
He knows what he wants.
Yes, he takes good care of me.

34:51.235 --> 34:53.780
The best bachelor party ever.

34:57.450 --> 35:03.165
Allows that you met a good guy.
Exactly. He's a good guy.

35:03.499 --> 35:07.753
One must keep on the good.
Yeah, cheers for that.

35:08.045 --> 35:10.214
Cheers.

35:17.889 --> 35:21.601
So how is your prospective bride?
Amanda.

35:21.893 --> 35:23.979
There are American.

35:28.609 --> 35:33.113
Yeah, she's amazing. As Boslov.
She knows exactly what she wants.

35:39.996 --> 35:44.209
I knew I wanted to marry me then
I was 30 and Amanda are good for it.

35:45.210 --> 35:48.421
She fits into the plan.
Absolutely.

35:50.549 --> 35:55.929
As you said, one must stick to something
good. One does not just younger.

36:00.309 --> 36:04.564
I feel completely.

36:23.042 --> 36:27.546
Yes, do so it rains on me.
Who is your father?

36:30.925 --> 36:35.764
Was not that sexy, Mitchie?
Yes, so much sausage in the face.

36:36.097 --> 36:38.308
Kill me now, girl.

36:39.768 --> 36:43.438
Now I will have a lapdance.
Sure you will.

36:43.689 --> 36:47.693
Your hussy.
What I give you one?

36:49.278 --> 36:52.031
Rain on me, girl.

36:52.281 --> 36:54.617
I have a better idea.

37:05.337 --> 37:10.008
Tell me, man. Are they a good couple?
Excuse?

37:10.300 --> 37:12.720
Come on, you can tell me.

37:12.803 --> 37:16.015
Derek is happy,
and it is the most important.

37:16.265 --> 37:21.229
Tull. You know that the answer is no.
And?

37:21.562 --> 37:26.317
He's your best friend.
Yes, but I do not decide.

37:27.277 --> 37:30.447
I support him no matter
what I think. You then?

37:30.697 --> 37:34.743
No way. Casey commits
a big mistake. She knows him hardly.

37:35.035 --> 37:38.580
And yet here we are.
Yes, we do.

37:39.915 --> 37:42.918
Thank you for talking with me.

37:44.420 --> 37:47.298
Come on, there's more to do in Vegas
than mope at a strip club.

37:47.548 --> 37:51.553
Shall we grab the other and pull?
Very happy.

37:51.845 --> 37:56.057
What about strippers, coke and hookers?
If it makes you happy then.

37:56.349 --> 38:00.520
This money is to you.
Money for you.

38:01.522 --> 38:05.025
OMG ... I think
that we met before.

38:06.360 --> 38:08.738
Frank, we're leaving.
Go to hell!

38:08.821 --> 38:12.575
I mean, seriously, come on.
Getting Providence join?

38:14.118 --> 38:16.246
Hello.

38:16.830 --> 38:22.043
No, Providence must work, what?
I can come after my second job.

38:22.377 --> 38:26.715
She is an angel, Adrian.
A fucking angel, god ...

38:27.883 --> 38:31.220
Have you seen Mitch?
Yeah, he's over there.

38:40.313 --> 38:42.398
How the hell ...

38:46.695 --> 38:50.657
I really like him. He is wild.
What do you think, Providence?

38:50.907 --> 38:55.245
I think he has some dark secrets
that can give him major problems.

38:56.914 --> 39:01.335
As I said, she is an angel!
Hands.

39:01.669 --> 39:04.464
Excuse
but I can not help it.

39:06.758 --> 39:09.677
All together. Mitch, we go.

39:09.969 --> 39:15.726
Frank, I mean seriously. Come on.
I can not find Casey and Derek.

39:16.101 --> 39:18.228
What?

39:18.937 --> 39:23.818
Sorry, we miss one prospective bride
and grooms. He is 1.90 and slim.

39:24.151 --> 39:27.905
She is 1.80, has short brown hair
and looks like a budding bride.

39:28.197 --> 39:33.203
I saw their friends. They were away
and fucked almost at my bar.

39:33.536 --> 39:35.747
Casey would never ...
Derek would not ...

39:35.997 --> 39:39.751
Whatever the chattering about to marry,
so I sent them supply

39:39.835 --> 39:43.338
Little Whites to solve it
and get them out of here.

39:43.630 --> 39:47.509
Little Whites?
Yes, wedding chapel down the street.

39:47.801 --> 39:50.304
Hell!
We must go.

39:55.351 --> 40:00.148
What is love?
It is patient, kind and soft.

40:00.482 --> 40:06.279
Love is joy, peace and happiness.
It knows no hatred or anger.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.907
Stop!

40:11.910 --> 40:14.121
Damn.

40:14.914 --> 40:17.249
Excuse me.

40:22.922 --> 40:26.342
No, Tatiana, they are real.
Mitchell, they are real.

40:26.593 --> 40:29.763
We walked right into a wedding
which was not theirs.

40:29.846 --> 40:34.351
I do not know what we should do.
So embarrassing.

40:37.021 --> 40:43.069
We are truly sorry.
Believe it or not, but it is common.

40:43.694 --> 40:48.241
We lack a prospective bride
and grooms. They came certain here tonight.

40:48.533 --> 40:54.205
Many passes here every night.
Sounds Derek and Casey known?

40:55.457 --> 40:57.668
Was you with them?
So when do you remember them?

40:57.751 --> 41:02.673
Do you think that this place is a joke?
This is God's household

41:03.007 --> 41:05.718
And we believe in
love true power.

41:05.968 --> 41:09.680
I would think that I remember all
who come here and marry -

41:09.972 --> 41:12.141
-but it had been a lie.

41:14.811 --> 41:17.480
They came here a while ago.

41:19.107 --> 41:23.987
I forget them never. Keep it as
a souvenir and if you excuse me.

41:24.321 --> 41:28.909
I have a photo booth to wash.
Look at this.

41:29.243 --> 41:34.332
Where is Casey? OMG ...
OMG!

41:35.541 --> 41:39.337
She sucks him.
OMG.

41:39.629 --> 41:43.717
We find them, it resolves itself.
No, do not dissolve.

41:44.009 --> 41:47.554
Boslov going to kill me.
Who the hell is Boslov?

41:47.846 --> 41:51.600
Casey fiance.
And my cousin.

41:52.476 --> 41:57.731
Boslov said it happened Casey something should
he take me in the desert and kill me.

41:58.107 --> 42:04.155
Come on, it's like you just saying.
No, he does really.

42:04.989 --> 42:07.575
Probably you and Derek too.

42:08.701 --> 42:10.870
Pardon?

42:11.621 --> 42:17.669
So Derek went with one that is going to marry
with a Russian mafia boss?

42:18.504 --> 42:21.590
He is the mafia boss and my family
does not allow it.

42:21.840 --> 42:25.761
Who cares? Hell.
I did not know either about it.

42:26.095 --> 42:31.517
Casey talking never about him.
Should not we learned that before?

42:31.851 --> 42:34.604
I do not know you.
Hell.

42:34.854 --> 42:39.568
What does it matter?
She could handle him and he is crazy!

42:39.901 --> 42:44.073
It's best that they do not marry.
Will someone someone to marry?

42:44.364 --> 42:48.118
You have at least that choice.
Shut up, Mitchell!

42:48.410 --> 42:54.459
Okay, if everyone just calm down themselves.
We just have to find them, okay?

42:54.917 --> 42:59.964
How do we do it?
You're right, we follow the tracks again.

43:00.966 --> 43:04.594
They are perhaps back at the hotel.
Well thought.

43:04.886 --> 43:07.848
They can be in one of the suites.
Yeah, ok ...

43:08.098 --> 43:11.477
You girls go back there now,
then we go if they stray.

43:11.727 --> 43:16.023
We meet their room, okay?
What is it with you, Mitchell? Cease!

43:16.357 --> 43:18.693
We meet.

43:20.194 --> 43:23.740
What the hell is wrong with him?
He is a little away only.

43:23.990 --> 43:25.992
Come on now.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.690
Hell! Damn!

43:55.774 --> 43:59.486
Okay, I'll drop say it,
but someone must call Amanda.

43:59.778 --> 44:04.408
And I mean man
and I mean you. Do it.

44:14.419 --> 44:18.256
<i> Hi, this is Casey. Sorry that you
miss me, but have a great day. </i>

44:18.548 --> 44:20.884
<i> Leave a message. </i>

44:20.967 --> 44:27.015
Casey, answer or returned to
room! I will not die, Casey!

44:30.227 --> 44:33.481
Do not reply. Do not reply.

44:35.316 --> 44:38.486
Hello?
Hey, Amanda. It is Adrian.

44:38.778 --> 44:43.575
I know, Adrian. I see it
just like any other with mobiles.

44:43.867 --> 44:47.871
Is it fixed?
I ... what?

44:48.205 --> 44:50.457
Got Derek be?

44:52.751 --> 44:56.714
Fantastic news.
You are a great asset to the company.

44:57.214 --> 44:59.675
You're a hussy.

45:02.345 --> 45:07.600
Good job, fag.
There you solved nicely.

45:07.976 --> 45:11.897
We should go back to the hotel.
Mitch starts to get thirsty.

45:15.692 --> 45:19.697
Relax, Sienna.
It's not your fault.

45:19.989 --> 45:23.159
I can solve the problem.
How it?

45:24.160 --> 45:28.915
I send pictures to my brother,
Dimitri. He finds missing people.

45:29.207 --> 45:33.795
Dimitri? Boslovs honor?
Da.

45:34.587 --> 45:37.758
Hell. Boslov get to know it.

45:38.008 --> 45:41.178
Relax, I asked him
do not tell it to anyone.

45:53.065 --> 45:57.487
What is it?
Nothing. There is nothing, Boslov.

45:58.321 --> 46:00.532
Are you sure?

46:05.495 --> 46:07.664
Boslov, I'm sorry.

46:09.792 --> 46:13.170
Where is Casey? Come on.

46:19.385 --> 46:21.721
The party's over for Boslov.

46:42.952 --> 46:46.915
Some progress?
What is the opposite of progress?

46:47.206 --> 46:49.876
I do not think that there is something like that.

46:50.710 --> 46:55.424
Tatiana sent a photo to his brother
that is with Boslov, so ...

46:55.716 --> 46:59.386
... Everything feels top.
Hell.

46:59.970 --> 47:05.267
So this does not seem to me?
Do not you think he kills me first?

47:05.601 --> 47:10.606
He does not care about anyone.
My whole family is terrified him.

47:15.612 --> 47:20.409
I tried to call Casey, but she
did not answer. You got Derek?

47:29.335 --> 47:32.046
Have not you tried calling him?

47:32.922 --> 47:36.843
What kind of friends are you?
I see, okay?

47:42.974 --> 47:45.519
Derek?
Who is this?

47:45.602 --> 47:48.564
Who are you? Where is Derek?
And how would I know?

47:48.814 --> 47:52.860
You have his phone.
Your friend left it on my place.

47:53.152 --> 47:56.072
When they went?
Recently.

47:56.155 --> 47:59.826
They said where they were going?
Give me your address there.

48:01.369 --> 48:06.124
I'll pay you, please.
Sure. Just do not nap me.

48:06.458 --> 48:08.543
Alright.

48:09.419 --> 48:14.675
58 East Balm. It called Darcade.
Okay, thanks. See you soon.

48:15.676 --> 48:21.515
Okay. Derek was last seen in a place
called Darcade. We begin there.

48:28.064 --> 48:30.775
What the hell are we waiting for?

48:32.986 --> 48:35.989
What the hell.
Much energy there.

48:36.239 --> 48:41.370
She fears for life, Mitch.
It's a bad time, Adrian ...

48:41.703 --> 48:46.876
... But she is heltent you.
Not now, guys.

48:47.209 --> 48:49.754
And thanks for your help!

48:50.338 --> 48:53.341
Best Friends.

48:55.218 --> 48:58.388
Where are you going?
Helping.

48:58.638 --> 49:00.891
I was just curious.

49:10.442 --> 49:13.237
So fucking stupid. I should
not released her sight.

49:13.320 --> 49:16.365
You're not stupid.
Do not touch me.

49:16.449 --> 49:19.160
So clearly you say it.
What the hell do you mean by that?

49:19.410 --> 49:23.998
You let it happen.
Had we just followed my plan ...

49:24.332 --> 49:28.754
Do not blame everything on us!
I find her, I die.

49:29.046 --> 49:33.008
Do not you think that I will find Derek?
You do not care a shit about him.

49:33.300 --> 49:36.387
What the hell do you know about it?
If you were his true friend ...

49:36.679 --> 49:41.767
... Had you stopped their wedding!
So now you're guarding honesty?

49:42.101 --> 49:45.480
Now all up!
Do not touch me.

49:45.730 --> 49:50.110
Now jump all into the cab.
Now, come on.

49:54.990 --> 49:57.993
Do you feel good?
No.

50:04.125 --> 50:08.379
Okay, time for the next gift ... my.

50:09.589 --> 50:15.637
What have we here? A gag!
The suits a hussy you.

50:17.806 --> 50:22.060
Shut up, it's you who is hussy.
I know.

50:22.352 --> 50:24.521
Can not we try it?

50:28.984 --> 50:31.112
Now.

50:33.739 --> 50:35.825
OMG ...

50:46.461 --> 50:49.298
You know how it works?

50:49.840 --> 50:53.010
Amanda Bryce. There she is.

50:56.889 --> 50:59.100
Well done, my friend.

51:00.476 --> 51:02.729
Eye for an eye, you bastard.

51:18.954 --> 51:21.791
You will get
another surprise immediately.

51:22.458 --> 51:24.752
But now ...

51:25.461 --> 51:27.714
Okay.

51:30.884 --> 51:33.094
Okay, girls ...

51:42.688 --> 51:45.691
I'm looking for Amanda.

51:53.658 --> 51:55.910
Amanda?

52:03.293 --> 52:05.462
Hello.

52:05.546 --> 52:08.632
She has been properly naughty.

52:11.886 --> 52:17.308
Yes ... bind and punishment her.
Really?

52:17.683 --> 52:19.894
I will punish her.

52:19.978 --> 52:24.941
I've been so naughty.
You get punish me as you will.

52:25.275 --> 52:27.319
Shut up.

52:37.997 --> 52:40.041
Nicely.

52:42.502 --> 52:45.338
Thank you.
You're going to love it.

52:46.673 --> 52:51.469
Your little hussy. You know that you are there.

52:51.803 --> 52:56.225
Your little hussy.
Do not pick too much dick.

52:58.185 --> 53:01.272
OMG. Cheers! Cheers!

53:02.606 --> 53:06.819
Reis! Reis! Bye, Amanda.

53:13.118 --> 53:15.954
It was intended
that to happen?

53:33.473 --> 53:36.851
Here it is.
It looks closed.

53:37.101 --> 53:39.896
All great places to do so.

53:44.693 --> 53:46.820
Here it is.

54:22.942 --> 54:26.487
Excuse me, I spoke with
a woman on the phone about ...

54:27.864 --> 54:30.658
What do you want?
We talked earlier.

54:30.909 --> 54:33.912
I'd grab the phone.
You said nothing about a bankruptcy.

54:34.162 --> 54:36.915
Come with me, alone.
Wait!

54:38.125 --> 54:40.586
I have money.

54:41.128 --> 54:43.505
Anyone else?
No.

54:43.589 --> 54:45.800
Come on.

54:56.227 --> 55:00.565
What kind of place is this?
A place where fantasies become true.

55:00.899 --> 55:05.279
First romm, ordinary stuff.
Girls. Sometimes two, three.

55:07.406 --> 55:13.371
And this is a little more specialized.
Was it a goat?

55:13.746 --> 55:15.832
I do not judge.

55:15.915 --> 55:18.960
It is private, purse.
I apologize.

55:19.210 --> 55:22.964
If you do, bust you out. Do you understand?
Yeah.

55:24.299 --> 55:27.844
How many rooms there are?
This is the last.

55:28.136 --> 55:33.517
OMG! No, get them to stop!
What happens there?

55:33.851 --> 55:37.980
Listen, I fill a void strippers
do not do. People want certain things.

55:38.648 --> 55:42.860
Such things they can not find elsewhere.
Please!

55:43.152 --> 55:46.114
And I give them a safe place.

55:46.364 --> 55:48.992
And you ask too much.

55:49.826 --> 55:54.873
Hell! Dennis! Not again.

55:55.207 --> 55:59.169
Stop sucking on anal plugs.
That is why one has kuleknebel.

56:06.761 --> 56:09.055
May I come in there?

56:13.768 --> 56:17.731
Go ahead. I come afterwards.

56:23.904 --> 56:26.156
What the hell!

56:26.991 --> 56:29.577
Tell me about your friend.

56:30.494 --> 56:36.543
He is tall, around 1.90. Styled hair,
slim. Most often a kind and quiet boy.

56:38.294 --> 56:43.300
Kind or quiet?
There they are for about an hour ago.

56:44.343 --> 56:46.845
I often get couples here.

56:50.724 --> 56:53.394
OMG ...

56:54.937 --> 56:57.648
It's them.

56:57.982 --> 57:03.613
People always come here and fucking
but they left without paying.

57:03.988 --> 57:09.119
Said where they were going?
Many places in Vegas is free ...

57:09.453 --> 57:12.998
... but not this. We have rules.
One must pay to play.

57:13.290 --> 57:17.211
Kind boy? What?

57:17.837 --> 57:21.883
I took some money for cleaning
and a little more like penalty.

57:22.174 --> 57:26.095
Let he left his wallet too?
Idiot would leave the pants here.

57:26.387 --> 57:28.848
No reason. Get out now.

57:37.941 --> 57:39.943
Are you ready?

57:43.072 --> 57:46.158
Frank?
Yes.

57:49.746 --> 57:51.789
Do you feel good?

57:54.501 --> 57:59.631
It is the best night of my life.
Best night of my life ...

58:04.470 --> 58:07.181
I saw God in there.

58:09.934 --> 58:14.313
He had blue eyes
and short, dark hair.

58:15.815 --> 58:21.196
He was definitely higher than 1.80.
Everything went so quickly.

58:21.571 --> 58:27.286
She was right there and he ...
Everything was so wrong.

58:27.661 --> 58:30.414
They will probably not that we should strip.

58:38.965 --> 58:42.635
What do you think happens back there?
Amber, be still.

58:43.636 --> 58:46.431
Are not you curious?
No.

58:46.681 --> 58:50.018
When the woman opened the door
smelled tramp dick.

58:53.105 --> 58:56.483
So where are they? She said something?
They are not here.

58:56.775 --> 58:59.987
They have benefited.

59:02.365 --> 59:04.700
I'm sorry.

59:06.369 --> 59:12.083
There is no danger, it dissolves.
Let Uncle Mitchell say anything.

59:13.043 --> 59:15.962
We just might distinguish storage

59:16.046 --> 59:22.094
And keep jobs, what?
Let them come to us.

59:25.389 --> 59:29.685
It's actually a really good idea.
Yeah, that's it.

59:31.354 --> 59:35.608
Okay, Frank.
Go back to Velvet Atheneum.

59:35.900 --> 59:40.947
You three go back to the hotel.
It's going to work, it's not true?

59:45.577 --> 59:47.705
Why is he like that?

59:47.955 --> 59:51.333
Who the hell cares?

59:51.417 --> 59:54.003
Because he has taken ecstasy.

59:55.630 --> 01:00:00.677
Frank? What did you just say?
I fixed his drink earlier.

01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:03.722
Derek too.
Derek too.

01:00:06.016 --> 01:00:11.230
What is wrong with you?
Stop! I'm tired of you, kjekking.

01:00:12.439 --> 01:00:17.486
So Derek and Casey
quite high and helpless?

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:20.531
Somehow.
No, it's good.

01:00:20.615 --> 01:00:24.786
Everyone goes to their records.
Sienna and I are here, there, -

01:00:25.078 --> 01:00:28.707
And so they become abstinent smÃ¥ningom
and find their way back.

01:00:28.957 --> 01:00:32.210
We do it, come on.

01:00:47.768 --> 01:00:52.106
It's my fault. This had never
happened if we went to Thunder dicks.

01:00:52.398 --> 01:00:55.735
We're going to find them, okay?
We still have time.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:02.618
Hell.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.456
Hello?
Sienna?

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:10.584
I'm coming after you.
Boslov, let me explain.

01:01:10.835 --> 01:01:15.673
It's not necessary. Greet Derek
I have a gift for him too.

01:01:15.965 --> 01:01:20.095
Derek, help! He is crazy!
I am bound and gagged!

01:01:28.854 --> 01:01:30.898
Well done.

01:01:33.067 --> 01:01:35.277
You might live.

01:01:41.743 --> 01:01:44.454
What the ...

01:01:46.748 --> 01:01:49.167
OMG ...

01:01:53.922 --> 01:01:56.050
Wow.

01:02:08.688 --> 01:02:13.443
Do not touch me. I'm so tired.
Do not give up.

01:02:16.488 --> 01:02:19.825
I need you.
I'm an idiot.

01:02:20.075 --> 01:02:26.040
He kills both me and you.
Request a miracle, because we need it.

01:02:36.176 --> 01:02:38.345
God?

01:02:41.139 --> 01:02:45.561
Even better, baby. this is
Jackrabbit Rabbit Ranch.

01:02:45.894 --> 01:02:48.814
brothel,
family restaurant and warehouses.

01:02:49.064 --> 01:02:51.776
Jack Rabbit?
Yes, exactly.

01:02:52.026 --> 01:02:58.074
Listen, I have a problem with
your friends Derek and Casey with me.

01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:03.121
Is Derek and Casey there?
Yes, I think so.

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:07.542
I lyrics address.
Okay, we're coming. Thank you, Mr. Rabbit.

01:03:07.834 --> 01:03:10.003
OMG!

01:03:12.339 --> 01:03:14.550
Come on.

01:03:28.898 --> 01:03:30.942
You are a freak.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:38.033
Hello?
Found them. Sending coordinates.

01:03:38.283 --> 01:03:42.079
Okay. I am there within an hour.

01:03:48.461 --> 01:03:51.214
If it does not work with Derek ...

01:03:52.507 --> 01:03:54.759
... I can marry you.

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:04.478
Brilliant news, yes ... No,
I have it much better. It spans.

01:04:05.771 --> 01:04:08.941
I know, I never looked away.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:18.493
No,
let me tell them that, ok? Yes.

01:04:19.828 --> 01:04:24.416
Adrian, I'm sorry tonight.
I'm really sorry.

01:04:26.501 --> 01:04:29.463
Yes, I love you too.

01:04:34.427 --> 01:04:38.014
Good news, ladies.
They have found the missing pair.

01:04:43.436 --> 01:04:46.022
So delicious.

01:04:47.315 --> 01:04:49.776
Okay, what the hell?

01:04:52.613 --> 01:04:55.741
What are you doing?
Excuse me.

01:04:55.991 --> 01:04:59.036
Not meaning to offend you.
It is not true.

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:03.416
Pretty girls that you go not only
around and massaging each other naked.

01:05:03.708 --> 01:05:05.752
It is absurd.

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:10.674
No, do not hide you.
There's something I must tell.

01:05:10.966 --> 01:05:14.511
I'm not gay. never
been there, I'm sorry.

01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:19.808
I just wanted to get to know you
and it is correct diseased.

01:05:20.434 --> 01:05:25.398
That's right sick.
But I did not expect me this.

01:05:32.447 --> 01:05:36.409
But honestly, do you think
we did this for our sakes?

01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:41.164
What?
We just wanted to fuck around with you.

01:05:41.498 --> 01:05:46.378
What?
You are so cute, but trying too hard.

01:05:46.712 --> 01:05:50.091
did you
that I was not gay all the time?

01:05:51.008 --> 01:05:53.094
Okay, how?

01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:04.147
So what do you say?

01:06:07.818 --> 01:06:12.239
Sheets are cold.
Make room for me, ladies!

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:27.297
Has not been a long day?
Yes, it really has.

01:06:30.008 --> 01:06:35.556
You were drugged and everything. Poor Mischka.

01:06:37.474 --> 01:06:40.603
Relax.
Tatiana and I'll take care of you.

01:06:40.895 --> 01:06:45.316
This is ...
Not yet. Drinks first.

01:06:50.154 --> 01:06:55.118
For an exceptional experience.
Cheers to that.

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:04.920
What is in it?

01:07:20.145 --> 01:07:24.232
It is the ugliest shoes
I have seen. Is the Italian?

01:07:26.902 --> 01:07:30.072
It was time.
Damn, you feel good?

01:07:30.322 --> 01:07:32.783
No, I do not feel good.
They drugged us.

01:07:33.033 --> 01:07:35.244
Quiet!

01:07:36.329 --> 01:07:41.543
I do not care about who drugged
whom. They owe me $ 5,000.

01:07:41.876 --> 01:07:44.713
$ 5,000?
You heard me.

01:07:44.796 --> 01:07:48.633
They requested services
from my finest kegs.

01:07:48.925 --> 01:07:53.097
Cans?
An internal expression meaning whore.

01:07:53.806 --> 01:07:57.268
I counted it.
And they used my best whore.

01:07:57.518 --> 01:08:01.647
Tax! Come in.
Hey.

01:08:02.815 --> 01:08:05.109
Providence?

01:08:05.193 --> 01:08:10.532
Gee, Providence!
Is there anyone who does not know you?

01:08:10.865 --> 01:08:12.951
No.

01:08:13.618 --> 01:08:19.041
Excuse me. sometimes surprises
her horniness even Jackrabbit.

01:08:19.375 --> 01:08:22.627
She is such a whore that they
second whores call her whore.

01:08:22.877 --> 01:08:27.300
It can swear.
Whatever came idiots in here ...

01:08:27.591 --> 01:08:32.055
... recognize Providence who took
them and said that they pay later.

01:08:32.346 --> 01:08:37.644
I take it not so easy,
for when they had finished, -

01:08:37.978 --> 01:08:42.064
They began to cry.
"I can not find your wallet!"

01:08:42.357 --> 01:08:46.904
"Boslov going to kill me."
So I chained them fixed -

01:08:47.238 --> 01:08:50.825
For they do not go from here
without paying $ 5,000.

01:08:51.867 --> 01:08:57.916
He says you should pay.
Can you pay him, Adrian ...

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:01.836
... Before he kills us?
He's not going to kill you.

01:09:02.087 --> 01:09:04.673
It's not over yet.

01:09:05.506 --> 01:09:07.801
You're not going to kill them.

01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:11.889
No, I'm not going to kill them.

01:09:13.807 --> 01:09:18.395
And no, I have not 5000 ...
Who the hell walks around with $ 5,000?

01:09:21.566 --> 01:09:26.529
Frank, old friend. What do you do?
Do not, what happens? Did you find them?

01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:30.533
Yes, we did.
Listen, I have a little problem.

01:09:30.783 --> 01:09:34.453
You must bring $ 5,000
to a place I lyrics.

01:09:34.746 --> 01:09:38.917
No, it does not.
I'm a little busy right now.

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:43.381
Frank, we need money, your monkey.
I can not hear you, Adrian.

01:09:43.673 --> 01:09:47.135
It is correct noisy here!
The storm is on the way!

01:09:47.385 --> 01:09:52.974
Hell! Is the storm on the way?
With 90% chance of rain.

01:09:59.648 --> 01:10:02.359
Can anybody beat me in the face?

01:10:03.152 --> 01:10:07.990
For some tits! We need shots!

01:10:08.908 --> 01:10:14.956
Come back. Ouch, my back.

01:10:18.793 --> 01:10:23.256
Frank, hell ...
Whoa, baby.

01:10:25.467 --> 01:10:29.930
I know how you can pay
debt. You and your friend setpoint

01:10:30.222 --> 01:10:35.436
Be in one of Jackrabbits known
amateur porn movies. What say you?

01:10:35.812 --> 01:10:39.482
Absolutely not.
I do not think you have much choice.

01:10:39.732 --> 01:10:45.155
There must be another way.
You receive $ 5,000 in cash ...

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:49.076
... which you give back to me
to pay their friends of Charges

01:10:49.368 --> 01:10:53.747
And since you can go home.
There is a good deal, believe me.

01:10:54.999 --> 01:10:57.126
It is.
What?

01:10:57.209 --> 01:11:01.672
In college I played in one like that,
but got only $ 500.

01:11:01.964 --> 01:11:06.845
What?
Exactly. Listen to the sexy lady.

01:11:07.137 --> 01:11:11.391
We have no time to discuss,
so let's just do it.

01:11:11.683 --> 01:11:14.227
Are you sure about this?
Yes.

01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:18.774
Relax.
I promise it will be elegant.

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:24.113
Okay, all down to the studio.

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:28.534
We solve this, okay?
I hate him.

01:11:44.885 --> 01:11:47.054
You do not do this.

01:11:47.137 --> 01:11:51.392
Okay, are you ready?
Yes.

01:11:51.684 --> 01:11:57.732
That's what they always say.
Okay, silence! Light.

01:11:59.150 --> 01:12:01.903
Sienna.
Just do it.

01:12:02.612 --> 01:12:04.698
Be so good.

01:12:41.612 --> 01:12:43.948
Look at me.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.496
Come on, show tits.

01:12:51.623 --> 01:12:53.959
Let me do it.

01:13:03.385 --> 01:13:05.513
Nicely.

01:13:11.936 --> 01:13:14.439
Have you seen?

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:23.282
This is gold.

01:13:32.667 --> 01:13:34.669
Oh yes.

01:13:37.964 --> 01:13:41.801
Movie Magic.
This is so fucking weird.

01:13:42.093 --> 01:13:44.304
Quietly, I said!

01:14:11.875 --> 01:14:15.212
Cut!
Boslov?

01:14:15.504 --> 01:14:17.840
Derek?
Amanda?

01:14:17.923 --> 01:14:21.427
What is going on here?
Okay, everybody. We begin again.

01:14:21.719 --> 01:14:24.055
Go to them.

01:14:28.643 --> 01:14:30.895
What are you doing here?

01:14:31.146 --> 01:14:35.066
Now you should talk.
Boslov.

01:14:35.358 --> 01:14:38.612
Adrian and I ...
I do not care Adrian.

01:14:38.862 --> 01:14:42.866
What did you do with my fiance?
She has not done anything.

01:14:43.158 --> 01:14:46.704
Do you speak again, it becomes
last time, I promise.

01:14:47.663 --> 01:14:51.751
Boslov, she was drugged.
Both became. Ecstasy or something.

01:14:52.043 --> 01:14:56.589
The thrust and we found them here.
Really?

01:14:56.881 --> 01:15:01.636
And what is it here? A celebration?
No, they ended up here ...

01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:06.475
... And we pay a debt.
Who the hell is he?

01:15:06.809 --> 01:15:11.814
Wait a little. I was the director here.
She speaks true.

01:15:12.106 --> 01:15:14.400
Just put down the weapon.

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:23.368
Stop, Boslov! I'm glad I have
Set the coward you really are.

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:28.165
It is over.
You.

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:35.798
You betrayed me.
I took meh you and you cheated on me!

01:15:37.758 --> 01:15:40.303
Is this over?

01:15:41.929 --> 01:15:44.057
Well.

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:47.644
And now you will all get to pay.

01:15:48.561 --> 01:15:52.566
So who will die first?

01:15:58.447 --> 01:16:00.616
Some?

01:16:01.659 --> 01:16:06.581
Not? Come on.
All may well not be wimps?

01:16:09.292 --> 01:16:12.712
Ole dole ...

01:16:14.714 --> 01:16:17.050
... duh ...

01:16:19.553 --> 01:16:21.972
Same it, I'll start with you.
No!

01:16:26.268 --> 01:16:30.314
Providence? Frank was right,
you are a true angel.

01:16:30.606 --> 01:16:33.401
I'm no angel, but a whore.
Who the hell is this?

01:16:33.484 --> 01:16:37.071
My former fiance.
Good answer.

01:16:38.698 --> 01:16:42.786
Okay, I think we're done here.
The debt then?

01:16:44.371 --> 01:16:47.082
Relax.

01:16:47.916 --> 01:16:50.711
I can make money in other ways.

01:16:54.799 --> 01:16:58.761
It was quite a night.
It's probably a bit of an operation.

01:17:05.643 --> 01:17:10.065
Adrian.
Wait a little.

01:17:11.024 --> 01:17:14.862
Listen, it did not
as planned last night.

01:17:15.154 --> 01:17:18.574
You still did what I asked for.

01:17:18.866 --> 01:17:22.161
It must have been difficult.
Difficult?

01:17:23.037 --> 01:17:26.999
We almost died together.
That's why I promotes you.

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:30.336
Congratulations.
Was that all?

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:35.091
Yes, that was all.
There is something right sick with this.

01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:41.640
Do I get a minute?
Of course.

01:17:44.518 --> 01:17:48.981
It was interesting.
Yes, I would say.

01:17:51.984 --> 01:17:56.489
So did you do it?
If I was drunk, geezer ...

01:17:56.823 --> 01:18:02.371
... and fucked hussy? I think so,
but it is not correct my thing.

01:18:02.746 --> 01:18:07.376
Derek, I think that ...
I know. You and Boslov?

01:18:08.544 --> 01:18:11.839
Yes, it's crazy.
It's your thing.

01:18:12.089 --> 01:18:16.427
Derek, I'm sorry.
It's okay.

01:18:16.719 --> 01:18:19.055
What do you think he said to her?

01:18:19.847 --> 01:18:24.394
I think we're ready here, huh?
I think so.

01:18:26.354 --> 01:18:30.734
You're a great guy and I'm sorry
I pushed you too much.

01:18:31.819 --> 01:18:33.946
It's ok.

01:18:35.406 --> 01:18:37.533
Ok ...

01:18:37.616 --> 01:18:42.538
I must call her girlfriends
and say that I'm not dead.

01:18:42.872 --> 01:18:48.920
Ok, so you are not with us?
No, I'm calling a cab.

01:18:50.714 --> 01:18:55.761
I'll never use fabric again.
Was it that bad?

01:18:57.221 --> 01:18:59.431
Well ...

01:18:59.515 --> 01:19:01.809
I canceled it.

01:19:01.892 --> 01:19:06.147
Do you know how much I
not remember of last night?

01:19:06.439 --> 01:19:10.068
Derek, I'm sorry
I did not support you anymore.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.365
No, it's ok. This was nevertheless
something I had to do yourself.

01:19:17.367 --> 01:19:21.622
I'll talk to her.
Yes.

01:19:24.083 --> 01:19:26.335
Come, we go.

01:19:34.427 --> 01:19:37.514
Hey.
Thank you.

01:19:42.352 --> 01:19:47.065
So it was your fiance?
Yes, that was it.

01:19:48.442 --> 01:19:51.195
Boslov seemed nice.

01:19:52.112 --> 01:19:55.741
Excuse me. I found
you said that he was a contractor.

01:19:56.742 --> 01:20:02.206
Yes ... I did not realize
that it was code language first.

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:07.754
Then I realized it was me
too scared to leave him.

01:20:08.672 --> 01:20:12.175
Afraid of him? Come on.

01:20:15.345 --> 01:20:17.932
Had we ...

01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:25.231
One forgets certainly not everything.
No.

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:34.324
So do you think that we could try?
Endeavour ...

01:20:36.535 --> 01:20:39.496
Are you asking me really like?

01:20:40.956 --> 01:20:45.294
Yes, damn. I do.

01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:49.882
Will you?
That's what she said.

01:20:52.593 --> 01:20:54.929
I mean seriously. Jump into the car.

01:21:22.917 --> 01:21:28.757
You want a drink? Water or something?
What the hell happened last night?

01:21:30.008 --> 01:21:32.678
I can think of a few things.

01:21:40.019 --> 01:21:43.648
What happened at Jack Rabbit's ...
What about it?

01:21:48.194 --> 01:21:52.699
It was weird. Proper strange.

01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:59.915
But only at the beginning and the
is not something I usually do.

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:06.964
Porn ie. I do not,
but I really like you, sex.

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:11.511
Having sex with you, or love.
Or, heck too.

01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:17.434
Thank you.

01:22:20.354 --> 01:22:25.776
You are an alright guy, Adrian. Thank you.

01:22:27.486 --> 01:22:31.949
And it's not something I
would otherwise have done either.

01:22:35.578 --> 01:22:37.622
Okay?

01:22:50.177 --> 01:22:53.806
We blowing in cameras this time.
Agreement.

01:23:58.250 --> 01:24:01.378
Hey.
What are you doing here?

01:24:06.675 --> 01:24:09.428
For an exceptional experience.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.044
Awake.

01:24:41.796 --> 01:24:46.551
No, it's not polite to talk
before has been presented.

01:24:49.429 --> 01:24:53.433
I will introduce you
for my friend, Luther.

01:24:54.893 --> 01:24:57.980
Will you meet him?

01:25:09.784 --> 01:25:11.953
I love this job.
