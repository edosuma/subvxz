01:22.640 --> 01:24.520
Don't be so modest.

01:39.920 --> 01:43.560
You're like Moses who splits the Red Sea
to let me in.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.120
And now we're business partners.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.400
Shall I tell you something,
Don Savastano?

01:58.520 --> 02:00.720
You can call me Gennaro.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.680
I like the sea a lot.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.960
I have a 20 meter yacht
that I love more than my family.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.080
If you're in distress at sea,
you call for help...

02:11.200 --> 02:13.240
and then your savior is not an asshole.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.360
You can't wish for a better friend.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.480
We're going to do great things together.

02:39.080 --> 02:43.080
Translated by: NederSubs

03:21.680 --> 03:23.560
Did the boys make a fuss?

03:23.680 --> 03:27.440
I explained that it's very profitable
to make sacrifices.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.640
They really listen to you.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.640
Because I kept all my promises so far.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.480
Branka.

03:38.080 --> 03:42.600
- Are you working with the Chinese now?
- It's good for them, and for me.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.400
- Ciro.
- Your partner?

03:46.800 --> 03:48.480
He's my brother.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.480
Go with him.

04:52.040 --> 04:55.560
BUSINESS DISTRICT, NAPLES

05:13.480 --> 05:15.480
- Gennaro.
- How are you, Michele?

05:18.560 --> 05:21.080
How nice to see you.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.560
I knew you had it in you.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.840
Without you,
nobody would've ever found out.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.520
Do you want coffee?
Let's go to my office.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.720
Can you bring us two coffee?

05:44.400 --> 05:47.080
Damn, quite an office.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.320
Well, I'm doing my best.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.960
Tell me, what are you doing here?

05:58.120 --> 06:01.240
I have 50 jobs for you.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.920
I have a new friend, Gaetano Sanni.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.160
From the laundry?

06:10.360 --> 06:13.120
We've become partners.

06:13.240 --> 06:18.560
He's given me a list of entrepreneurs
who are deeply in debt.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.800
- Do you know what that means?
- No?

06:23.400 --> 06:26.160
That I can now buy
a whole bunch of companies.

06:26.280 --> 06:29.440
And you can get a lot of people a job.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.640
And I'm guessing behind every job
is a family that's going to vote for me?

06:39.960 --> 06:43.680
If you pass on municipal contracts
to my people...

06:43.800 --> 06:46.720
I'll make sure
you become regional president.

06:50.240 --> 06:55.400
Talk to everyone, then.
Tell them there's even too much work.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.440
There is never too much work.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.200
Thanks, Gennaro.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.920
Take care.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.840
The new polls are in.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.040
Here it is.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.480
Come with me.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.520
- Excuse me?
- Come on in.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.840
- Do you have the money?
- Yes.

08:35.159 --> 08:40.679
It's almost 15,000, except for 200.
My father gave me everything he had.

08:40.799 --> 08:45.480
We asked everyone,
but it wasn't enough.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.120
- We're not that strict.
- Thanks.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.840
Who's the job for?

08:54.960 --> 08:57.880
For my husband, Lucio Calori.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.760
He can't speak for himself?

08:59.880 --> 09:02.400
She already thanked you,
what more do you want?

09:02.520 --> 09:08.520
Don't mind him, he is upset.
We buried his mother yesterday.

09:10.480 --> 09:14.040
- Do you even want that job?
- He really does.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.080
I'm talking to him.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.920
What will it be?

09:20.040 --> 09:22.040
- Do you want to work or not?
- Yes.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.560
Yes? Yes, thank you.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.160
Yes, thank you.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.640
Have a nice day.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.520
How are you?

10:13.080 --> 10:15.120
- Come in, Nicola.
- Hello.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.320
The house is looking great.

10:24.520 --> 10:29.320
- How many people were there today?
- We got 32 people a job.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.280
- 480,000 euros?
- It's in here.

10:41.120 --> 10:44.280
- Great.
- Bye, Gennaro.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.240
- Hey, Gaetano.
- Hey, Gennaro.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.520
This is the list you asked for.

11:27.400 --> 11:31.120
How the hell
can a funeral home be in debt?

11:32.400 --> 11:35.040
One can stop eating, not dying.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.880
Dead people
don't gamble away their home.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.720
- They want your money.
- How do you know that?

11:42.840 --> 11:44.760
I know the bank manager well.

11:44.880 --> 11:49.800
I promised him money for information
on people who want to borrow money.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.480
Was that stupid of me?

11:52.600 --> 11:54.720
No, that was a smart move.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.440
Good morning, you wanted to see me?

15:10.240 --> 15:14.680
From now on, only approved funeral homes
can come to here.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.600
Is that a joke?

15:17.800 --> 15:20.680
My family never makes jokes.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.440
Here, this is the first one.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.080
Make sure it is not your last one.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.040
Do you know what to do?

17:11.160 --> 17:14.520
If anyone asks for God's forgiveness,
I'll call you.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.920
Amen.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.760
Hello, Patrizia.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.520
How are you, Gennaro?

17:49.640 --> 17:51.960
Fine, I'm recovering.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.480
Thanks for stopping by.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.800
We had a deal, you and me.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.040
From the beginning.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.080
I'm keeping that deal.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.040
Come with me,
I want to show you something.

18:22.920 --> 18:26.800
This company used to deliver
meals to school cafeterias...

18:26.920 --> 18:30.880
and then they ruined it
by serving dirty food and rotten meat.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.720
Children became ill
and then the place was closed.

18:36.200 --> 18:40.720
But tomorrow it will reopen
with a new name and cheap labor.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.160
Who owns this place?

18:48.280 --> 18:52.040
It's mine. I bought it from a friend.
What do you think?

18:54.480 --> 18:56.560
Why is that important?

18:57.880 --> 19:00.080
Because this place is yours now.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.120
Who do we work for?

19:12.240 --> 19:14.640
Michele Casillo, the mayor.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.840
He gave us the contract
for the primary schools...

19:19.960 --> 19:22.720
but when we make him
regional president...

19:22.840 --> 19:26.240
we'll get all the hospitals and schools
in the area.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.120
Are you interested?

19:55.580 --> 19:57.380
Patrizia, where were you?

19:58.540 --> 20:02.180
Gennaro called, I saw him.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.540
She never tells me anything.

20:04.660 --> 20:07.220
We'll smoke outside.

20:20.940 --> 20:23.220
What does our little Gennarino want?

20:24.340 --> 20:28.460
- He wants to offer you a proposal.
- Is that so?

20:42.980 --> 20:45.140
What is it about?

20:45.260 --> 20:50.060
He says things are going well,
he has a new drugs supplier.

20:50.180 --> 20:54.740
He wants you in, because
four hands are always better than two.

20:54.860 --> 20:59.220
Gennaro is history.
He's as poor as a church mouse.

20:59.340 --> 21:02.140
And now he comes crying to mommy?

21:04.260 --> 21:07.620
As far as I could tell,
he got back on its feet.

21:07.740 --> 21:10.340
You don't see shit under water.

21:13.660 --> 21:15.980
I'll do what you say.

21:19.060 --> 21:22.060
But I'd think twice about it...

21:22.180 --> 21:25.060
because there's no money left
in Secondigliano.

21:26.140 --> 21:28.900
That stuff from the Albanians is shit.

21:29.020 --> 21:33.420
And when you're broke,
your best friends will turn into enemies.

21:36.220 --> 21:38.420
Do you know what changed?

21:39.860 --> 21:45.380
Mom had a child and she lost it.
And she doesn't want children anymore.

22:10.540 --> 22:12.340
Stop here.

22:54.700 --> 22:57.820
Excuse me,
can I have the key to the gate?

23:03.900 --> 23:05.900
There was never a lock on that.

23:06.020 --> 23:09.180
- Probably a relative's.
- I'll ask.

23:10.220 --> 23:15.300
- Mom, do you have the key?
- No. There was never a lock on it.

23:18.140 --> 23:20.540
- What happens now?
- Calm down.

23:20.660 --> 23:24.300
We'll talk to the manager.
Are you coming with me?

23:24.420 --> 23:26.340
I'll be right back.

23:28.020 --> 23:30.100
Put the coffin down for now.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.500
Excuse me, could you come with me?

23:53.700 --> 23:55.700
- What is it?
- Good morning.

23:55.820 --> 23:58.860
Armando Maccaluso,
this is the death certificate.

23:58.980 --> 24:03.620
- The family mausoleum is locked.
- Sorry, but it's full.

24:05.100 --> 24:08.060
How is that possible?
That's our family mausoleum.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.620
Remove that chain immediately.

24:10.740 --> 24:15.060
The mausoleum is yours,
but you chose the wrong funeral home.

24:15.180 --> 24:19.900
- Do you want me to call the police?
- Sure, go ahead.

24:20.020 --> 24:24.580
How many free spots are there
in your mausoleum? Four?

24:24.700 --> 24:28.500
If you call the police,
they will be filled in no time.

24:48.340 --> 24:49.980
And?

24:50.100 --> 24:52.500
She says she doesn't want to see you.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.900
She doesn't care about your business.

25:01.740 --> 25:05.740
Do you know why I asked you
to stay close to Cianel?

25:05.860 --> 25:10.020
She is the only one in Secondigliano
who has men and weapons.

25:11.620 --> 25:14.020
That's why you have to convince her.

25:17.380 --> 25:19.620
How do you convince a snake?

25:23.940 --> 25:25.860
With a gift.

25:27.700 --> 25:30.100
If she says yes, she gets a mega gift.

26:08.220 --> 26:11.420
- Thanks for coming right away.
- What happened?

26:11.540 --> 26:14.100
I hired those people, as you said.

26:14.220 --> 26:17.220
- Is someone making trouble?
- No, on the contrary.

26:17.340 --> 26:21.620
They work very hard.
But I can't pay them.

26:21.740 --> 26:24.620
- How so?
- The State is behind on their payments.

26:24.740 --> 26:30.300
I used all the money to keep
the banks happy and now I'm broke.

26:30.420 --> 26:32.780
That's the problem?

26:32.900 --> 26:38.460
Pay who you can and explain it to the rest.
This is the State's fault, not ours.

26:38.580 --> 26:40.780
And if someone makes a fuss?

26:44.820 --> 26:49.260
Then you send them to me,
and I'll explain it one more time.

27:27.540 --> 27:29.460
Lucio Calori.

27:32.540 --> 27:34.580
Sign here.

27:40.380 --> 27:41.780
Thanks.

27:53.460 --> 27:55.620
- What's this?
- Something wrong?

27:55.740 --> 27:58.500
I'm talking to the person who hired me.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.140
Do you have a problem?

28:03.260 --> 28:08.060
The monthly salary was 1150 euros,
this is only 850. Why is that?

28:08.180 --> 28:12.220
- The rest is taxes.
- Taxes?

28:12.340 --> 28:15.860
What taxes?
We don't have an employment contract...

28:15.980 --> 28:19.940
or social security.
We're paid off the books, we don't exist.

28:20.060 --> 28:23.500
If the government gave you work,
you had to pay taxes.

28:23.620 --> 28:27.100
We gave you this job,
and you pay us nothing?

28:27.220 --> 28:32.140
- I already paid for this job.
- Think before you start screaming.

28:32.260 --> 28:35.940
- I paid 15,000 for this job.
- 14,800.

28:36.060 --> 28:40.020
And for that 14,800 euros
we gave you a huge gift.

28:40.140 --> 28:43.900
You're old,
no one hires you at your age.

28:45.620 --> 28:51.340
At my age, I kick the shit
out of little assholes like you.

28:52.340 --> 28:55.260
This is not over yet.
And don't laugh, you idiot.

28:59.340 --> 29:01.020
Next.

29:05.580 --> 29:10.620
- Cianel said yes, she's coming tomorrow.
- Great.

29:12.060 --> 29:16.620
Our stuff sells very well,
at parties and in clubs.

29:16.740 --> 29:19.300
Better than if we would sell it
on the streets.

29:19.420 --> 29:22.260
The federation didn't notice anything?

29:22.380 --> 29:25.140
Not yet, but that's a matter of time.

29:27.980 --> 29:31.860
We sold 100 kilos within a month,
in their territory.

29:37.460 --> 29:40.700
We must prepare for a war.

29:40.820 --> 29:45.940
- I don't know if your boys are ready.
- You already saw what they can do.

29:46.060 --> 29:49.060
Selling drugs is a breeze.

29:49.180 --> 29:51.540
But they only know war from video games.

29:51.660 --> 29:54.300
You were like that, right?

29:54.420 --> 29:56.620
But then you learned it.

30:00.660 --> 30:04.580
I had the best teacher,
who never felt sorry for me.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.260
What are you thinking?

30:21.740 --> 30:26.140
There is someone who wants to
put his nose into our business.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.140
Blue Blood has to do it.

30:36.140 --> 30:40.460
He has to do it. We can't handle it alone
when all hell breaks loose.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.620
- Good evening.
- Ciro.

31:18.020 --> 31:20.020
I need to speak to you.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.300
Guys, please excuse us.

31:54.020 --> 31:56.060
You have to do it.

31:58.820 --> 32:01.100
What did he do?

32:01.220 --> 32:03.740
That's not the point.

32:03.860 --> 32:06.380
It's about what you are going to do.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.620
You can't handle it?

32:12.780 --> 32:16.100
This moment was coming,
you knew that too.

32:25.140 --> 32:27.020
How does it feel, to kill someone?

32:29.980 --> 32:33.860
Just like being born:
nobody asked for it.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.260
Now you have to do it.

36:01.980 --> 36:04.620
Giosuè, here's your pants...

36:04.740 --> 36:08.060
your shirt and your socks.
You can dress yourself.

36:08.180 --> 36:13.820
- Come on, Dad, help me.
- You're not a baby anymore, are you?

36:13.940 --> 36:17.140
You're a man,
you have to dress yourself.

36:17.260 --> 36:19.460
I'll wait for you there.

36:57.220 --> 36:59.700
- Are you okay?
- Yes, just a bit tired.

36:59.820 --> 37:02.140
- You're tired?
- A bit.

37:02.260 --> 37:04.220
- Do you want me to help?
- I'm fine.

37:04.340 --> 37:07.380
They really did put you to work.

37:07.500 --> 37:09.220
- Are you hungry?
- Actually, yes.

37:09.340 --> 37:10.740
- What do you want?
- Pizza.

37:10.860 --> 37:13.940
I knew it, you always want pizza.

38:04.780 --> 38:07.900
We've searched everything,
there's no one here.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.300
- Sure?
- You can go inside.

38:15.660 --> 38:19.100
Apparently Gennarino doesn't want
to cross me after all.

38:19.220 --> 38:22.060
What are you going to do now?

38:22.180 --> 38:26.100
Life is like poker,
I want to see the cards before I raise.

38:27.540 --> 38:30.380
Donna Annalisa, good morning.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.580
This way, please.

38:53.380 --> 38:55.260
I'm here.

38:57.740 --> 38:59.380
Hello, Annalisa.

39:02.420 --> 39:05.740
Did you know that death
is the best business of all?

39:05.860 --> 39:09.660
Why are you telling me that?
You think my time has come?

39:13.140 --> 39:15.820
This store can be yours.

39:15.940 --> 39:18.220
Do I have to become a grave digger,
or what?

39:21.660 --> 39:24.220
Things are not going well
in Secondigliano.

39:24.340 --> 39:28.780
The street sales are dropping
and you have to pay quite a few salaries.

39:30.860 --> 39:33.180
I've found a solution for you.

39:38.860 --> 39:44.420
Logos Logistics, Panareo Car Dealership,
Security Service...

39:44.540 --> 39:46.900
What's all this?

39:47.020 --> 39:51.020
Struggling companies that I bought,
just like this one.

39:52.420 --> 39:57.380
We can divide them and set up a system,
just like the clans downtown.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.180
I know how they do that.

40:00.300 --> 40:03.540
The problem is...
I have a kind of hunch.

40:04.700 --> 40:06.980
You're trying to cross me.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.660
I don't want to cross you.
Think about it.

40:12.140 --> 40:15.500
With your drugs profits,
you'll buy a share of 51%...

40:15.620 --> 40:18.580
in the four branches
of this funeral home.

40:18.700 --> 40:23.060
You can get people a job
and buy your supplies wherever you want.

40:24.740 --> 40:28.980
And then I sell you the florist,
quarry and carpentry shop.

40:29.100 --> 40:33.580
Your profits will go up and whoever
wants to work for you, has to pay.

40:35.540 --> 40:38.540
We've always made
the biggest money on the streets.

40:42.620 --> 40:46.420
But in Secondigliano,
drugs are not the biggest business.

40:47.580 --> 40:48.980
Hunger is.

40:52.340 --> 40:55.060
And we must take advantage
of that hunger.

40:58.380 --> 41:03.300
We have to work together in Secondigliano
to get a stronger position.

41:03.420 --> 41:06.980
Okay, Gennarino,
it's true you got back on your feet.

41:07.100 --> 41:10.700
There's a problem.
It's best to wait here.

41:10.820 --> 41:13.620
I decide for myself what's best for me.

41:49.300 --> 41:50.940
Good morning, Annalisa.

41:52.940 --> 41:54.860
Ciro Di Marzio.

42:22.860 --> 42:27.220
When my father took over Secondigliano,
it was a slum...

42:27.340 --> 42:31.420
where they dumped people
who were not welcome downtown.

42:32.620 --> 42:35.460
My father saw a future in it...

42:35.580 --> 42:39.060
and made it into the largest
drugs supermarket in Europe.

42:39.180 --> 42:42.460
Do you know how they called us
downtown in the 1980s?

42:42.580 --> 42:44.420
The little monkeys.

42:44.540 --> 42:48.860
They treated us like animals
and wanted to lock us in cages.

42:48.980 --> 42:52.180
- You remember that, right?
- Certainly.

42:52.300 --> 42:54.700
Nobody will forget that.

42:54.820 --> 42:58.460
But thanks to my father
they later became nice to us...

42:58.580 --> 43:00.540
to get our drugs.

43:02.060 --> 43:07.140
But that courtesy is no longer needed.
We don't sell anything here anymore.

43:08.180 --> 43:11.180
We have to get on the streets downtown.

43:15.420 --> 43:17.580
And who are they?

43:22.620 --> 43:24.540
Our Trojan horse.

43:30.500 --> 43:32.980
Do you know what this means?

43:34.580 --> 43:38.460
We must prepare ourselves
for a war against the federation.

44:36.500 --> 44:38.580
There's another funeral coming.

44:39.305 --> 44:45.550
