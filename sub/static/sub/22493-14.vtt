Oh, glass.

Damn it!

Ugh!

Ugh!

01:38.500 --> 01:41.458
You can't be serious.

the fund has

01:45.460 --> 01:46.609
been completely
emptied.

01:46.700 --> 01:47.576
Where did
the money?

01:47.700 --> 01:48.894
Accountants
are struggling to

01:49.020 --> 01:49.816
solve the mystery.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.777
$45,000 going
once, $45,000

02:05.900 --> 02:07.618
going twice,
and sold to the

02:07.740 --> 02:08.967
bidder in the rear!

02:11.420 --> 02:12.455
Oh, my God!

02:18.060 --> 02:19.334
There you go,
Bill Gates.

02:19.460 --> 02:20.688
Okay,
Bill Gates, the kids

02:20.820 --> 02:22.253
from NS YNC,
Richard Branson, and

02:22.340 --> 02:23.693
what l guess is
Michael Jackson

02:23.820 --> 02:25.139

aboard the world's

02:25.260 --> 02:26.613

billionaires flight.

02:26.740 --> 02:27.490
Anyone missing?

02:27.620 --> 02:29.611
Um...
The Chinese guy, Ling-Ling.

02:29.740 --> 02:34.291
Oh,
this must be him.

02:44.740 --> 02:46.298
All right,
let's do this.

02:46.420 --> 02:47.455
Come on. Try.

02:47.580 --> 02:48.933
Ahoy.
Thar be boobies.

02:49.060 --> 02:50.209
You're ruining it!

02:50.300 --> 02:51.779
l want you to
take me, like

02:51.860 --> 02:53.054
Captain Jack Sparrow.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.449
l thought that
character was a chick.

02:55.540 --> 02:56.768
<i>This is my fantasy.</i>

02:56.900 --> 02:57.935
Try to be realistic.

[ cockney accent ]
Are you

03:01.220 --> 03:02.699
ready to be ravaged,
me lady?

03:02.780 --> 03:04.008
lt is quite
humid south of

03:04.140 --> 03:08.338
the equator,
my Captain.

03:08.460 --> 03:10.735
Oh, oh, don't
mind the little

03:10.820 --> 03:12.412
stowaways,
my darling.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.529
Ew. Lice?

03:13.620 --> 03:17.454
No Pantene on
the seven seas!

03:18.460 --> 03:19.256
Oh, my god!

03:19.380 --> 03:20.779
l've been brushing
my teeth

03:20.860 --> 03:22.293
with rum and
brine for close to

03:22.420 --> 03:23.978
20 years,
my little siren.

03:24.060 --> 03:24.936
Pay it no mind.

03:25.060 --> 03:27.210
l don't know
if l'm ready for this.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.653
Then l should
warn you.

03:28.780 --> 03:30.816
l haven't a memory
of me last wash.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.492
You might find
my balls have the

03:32.620 --> 03:34.895
scent of vinegar
fermenting in feta cheese.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.049
Ugh! Oh!

03:36.140 --> 03:37.129
l c-- l can't.
l can't.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.056
Wait, my dear.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.368
lt's hard to
give chase, what

03:39.500 --> 03:40.410
with the
horrific and

03:40.540 --> 03:41.609
debilitating
rickets that

03:41.740 --> 03:42.729
affected ocean-
bound travelers

03:42.820 --> 03:43.616
of that time!

03:43.740 --> 03:44.536
You know what?

03:44.620 --> 03:45.735
lf you're not
gonna take this

03:45.860 --> 03:47.418
serious, then
we're not gonna do it.

03:47.540 --> 03:48.575
[ normal voice ]
What?!

03:48.700 --> 03:50.497
You said
be realistic!

03:50.980 --> 03:52.811
Sir, the whole
boat is rigged

03:52.940 --> 03:53.736
to explode.

03:53.860 --> 03:54.929
And l found this.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.938
Greetings from the Joker!

03:58.060 --> 04:00.654
Why so serious?

04:00.780 --> 04:02.099
Anyway, we
have a boat of

04:02.220 --> 04:04.415
civilians and a
boat of prison inmates.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.775
l will blow up
both boats at midnight!

04:06.900 --> 04:07.696
Oh, my God!

04:07.820 --> 04:09.299
However, each
boat has a

04:09.380 --> 04:11.052
detonator that
will blow up the

04:11.140 --> 04:11.970
opposite boat.

04:12.100 --> 04:13.533
lf one boat
decides to blow

04:13.620 --> 04:15.019
up the other
boat prior to

04:15.140 --> 04:16.778
midnight, l will
not blow up the

04:16.899 --> 04:18.731
boat that blows
up the other

04:18.820 --> 04:19.616
boat.

04:19.740 --> 04:20.728
lt's quite the
moral quandary,

04:20.820 --> 04:21.616
is it not?

04:21.740 --> 04:23.458
T-then let's
vote on neither

04:23.580 --> 04:24.535
boat blowing up.

04:24.620 --> 04:26.053
<i>No, he says
we decide!</i>

04:26.180 --> 04:28.296
Then l decide
neither boat blows up!

04:28.420 --> 04:29.648
<i>Wait, wait.
So we vote?</i>

04:29.780 --> 04:30.576
No, we --
we just press the

04:30.660 --> 04:31.456
button, l think.

04:31.580 --> 04:32.376
l don't understand!

04:32.460 --> 04:33.449
What does this
prove exactly?

04:33.540 --> 04:35.098
Uh,
Mr. Joker, sir?

04:35.220 --> 04:36.448
We came to
a consensus.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.417
We vote that neither
boat should blow up.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.296
Yeah!

04:39.420 --> 04:40.216
Very good.

04:40.340 --> 04:41.136
That's my vote.

04:41.260 --> 04:42.295
That's not a choice!

04:42.380 --> 04:43.574
Uh, you better
explain it

04:43.700 --> 04:44.496
again, then,
l guess.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.172
l will blow up
both the boats.

04:47.300 --> 04:48.096
My God!

04:48.180 --> 04:50.091
<i>Unless --
unless one boat</i>

04:50.180 --> 04:51.932
blows up the
other boat first.

04:52.020 --> 04:53.373
Uh, w-what
are the other

04:53.460 --> 04:54.256
options?

04:54.380 --> 04:55.654
There are no
other options.

04:55.780 --> 04:57.418
Ask him when
both boats blow up.

04:57.540 --> 04:58.939
Midnight!
Midnight! Midnight!

04:59.020 --> 05:00.419
All right, folks,
that gives

05:00.540 --> 05:01.575
us a good
15 minutes.

05:01.660 --> 05:02.934
Everyone into
the lifeboats.

05:03.060 --> 05:03.970
No!
No lifeboats!

05:04.060 --> 05:05.539
l said that you
couldn't use them!

05:05.660 --> 05:07.093
You never said that!
l did!

05:07.220 --> 05:08.255
Way back in
the beginning!

05:08.340 --> 05:10.058
You'd better go
over the rules again.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.858
Oh, for --
it's a catch-22!

05:11.980 --> 05:14.369
Look, there
are two boats!

05:14.500 --> 05:16.695
At midnight --
Good day, sir.

05:16.820 --> 05:17.616
And good
day to you.

05:17.740 --> 05:20.379
Yes.
Let's begin.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.296
Ha!

Oh.

05:32.220 --> 05:35.451
Ha!

05:35.580 --> 05:36.456
Damn it!

05:38.260 --> 05:40.137
The mechanism.

05:40.260 --> 05:43.297
Ha!

05:48.860 --> 05:50.418
Well, uh...

05:50.540 --> 05:51.416
Good effort, sir.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.132
Well done.
Well done.

05:54.740 --> 05:56.139
Nobody
can stop me!

05:56.220 --> 05:57.448
l'm gonna
kill you all!

05:57.580 --> 06:02.370
Won't anyone
save us?!

06:03.820 --> 06:05.048
Dr. Manhattan!

06:06.980 --> 06:08.698
You are safe now.

06:08.820 --> 06:11.209
Mm! Thanks!

06:12.820 --> 06:15.380
Ooh. Yeah.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.891
Safe now.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.538
Hello?!

06:29.700 --> 06:30.496
You here?

06:30.580 --> 06:31.933
Why don't
you have a seat,

06:32.020 --> 06:32.816
Mr. Goldschmidt?

06:32.940 --> 06:34.339

Who are you?

06:34.420 --> 06:35.648
Chris Hansen,
''Dateline NBC.''

Well, good for you.

06:38.420 --> 06:39.648
Where's Teendream94?

06:39.780 --> 06:41.418
There is no Teendream94.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.899
lt was a
sting operation.

06:43.020 --> 06:43.816
What the hell?

06:43.900 --> 06:45.015
Are you serious?!

06:45.100 --> 06:46.692
l took a day off
of work for this!

06:46.820 --> 06:48.139
And l blew, like,
half a tank of

06:48.260 --> 06:49.215
gas driving
over here!

06:49.300 --> 06:50.574
You idiots better
reimburse me!

06:50.700 --> 06:51.450

06:51.580 --> 06:53.013
Y-you must be joking.

Dungeon Master!

08:13.620 --> 08:15.258
What could be
more important?!

08:15.380 --> 08:16.779
He said he
has a date.

08:16.860 --> 08:19.135
As if!

08:19.220 --> 08:21.336

would date Barry?!

Back to ''A Shot
at Love With Tila Tequila.''

big chance.

the design and

There's also a
dragon in there?

08:47.580 --> 08:49.013
Uh! Uh,
of course not!

08:49.140 --> 08:50.619
No, that's
ridiculous!

08:50.740 --> 08:51.536
A dragon?

08:51.620 --> 08:54.498
What l meant to
say is you find

yourselves
in a dark,

No way!

09:02.500 --> 09:04.730
For this adventure,
l select

09:04.860 --> 09:06.134
my Elven Spellthief.

Wait!

My elven bodybuilder
Spellthief!

09:09.460 --> 09:11.178
l choose my
goblin fashion model.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.699
She has a recording
contract and

09:12.780 --> 09:14.008
a recurring role
in a goblin

09:14.140 --> 09:14.936
prime-time
drama.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.294
Are those boobs
real or an

09:16.380 --> 09:17.529
elaborate
illusion spell?

09:17.620 --> 09:19.850
To find out,
l roll for ''grope''!

09:19.980 --> 09:21.698
Ooh, 1 1 , a very
sexy number.

09:23.140 --> 09:25.859
l cast
''testicular rupture!''

09:25.980 --> 09:28.540
Ohh!
Fire crotch!

09:28.660 --> 09:30.537
You are attacked
by a grue!

09:31.620 --> 09:32.735
l fire an arrow!

09:32.860 --> 09:34.054
Arrows are
no good against

09:34.180 --> 09:36.569
his
leathery hide!

09:36.700 --> 09:38.053
No! No!

09:38.180 --> 09:40.250
Yeah, baby!

09:40.340 --> 09:43.252
lntroducing
King Kickass!

09:43.340 --> 09:44.898
â™ª Everyone who
plays this queer

09:45.020 --> 09:46.533
game has
two vaginas â™ª

09:46.620 --> 09:47.416
â™ª Yeah â™ª

09:47.540 --> 09:48.529
Three, two, one,
awesome!

09:50.980 --> 09:52.174
Get out of here,
Munson!

09:52.300 --> 09:53.528
Your elf
appears to have

09:53.620 --> 09:55.019
popped a boner
when he witnessed

09:55.140 --> 09:56.289
the abs of
King Kickass!

09:56.420 --> 09:57.170
He did not!

09:57.300 --> 09:58.858
You don't even
know how to play!

09:58.980 --> 10:00.493
Actually, his
character sheet

10:00.620 --> 10:01.735
appears to
be in order.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.851
Um, well, we
do need another player.

10:03.980 --> 10:05.015
Ugh!

10:07.820 --> 10:08.855
Fine!

10:08.980 --> 10:11.016
You now
enter the inner

10:11.100 --> 10:11.896
sanctum!

10:12.020 --> 10:14.409
Your goal is
finally in sight --

10:14.540 --> 10:16.417
a treasure chest!

10:16.540 --> 10:17.893
Pbht,
predictable.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.931
However, the
treasure chest

10:20.060 --> 10:21.698
is guarded
by an Owlbear!

10:21.780 --> 10:23.850
lt commands
an army of

10:23.980 --> 10:25.129
Monkeybees!

10:25.220 --> 10:27.131
Hmm, shaking
the dust off a few

10:27.220 --> 10:28.448
relics, l see.

10:28.580 --> 10:30.298
Sorry, Dungeon Master,
but those

10:30.420 --> 10:32.012
ridiculous beasts
can't match up

10:32.140 --> 10:34.700
to a team of,
uh...

10:34.820 --> 10:35.696
uh --

10:36.820 --> 10:38.333
Where did Stacey
and Munson go?!

10:38.460 --> 10:39.859
Munson said
something about

10:39.980 --> 10:41.493
banging fingers
in your parents'

10:41.620 --> 10:42.848
bedroom.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.658
Shall we watch
''Tila Tequila''?

10:44.780 --> 10:46.008
Yes.
Want to borrow a sock?

10:46.100 --> 10:46.900
Yes.
